WEBVTT

00:04.472 --> 00:07.475
Guard: WRIST BAND.

00:07.508 --> 00:14.215
"MOSES, REGGIE.
CDC-S45973."

00:17.651 --> 00:20.621
YOU WANT US TO STAY?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

00:20.654 --> 00:22.623
ALL RIGHT, SIR.

00:22.656 --> 00:25.193
IF YOU NEED US,
JUST SCREAM.

00:35.136 --> 00:38.506
WELL...
SINCE OUR BAD-MANNERED

00:38.539 --> 00:40.374
CORRECTIONAL OFFICER
DIDN'T BOTHER,

00:40.408 --> 00:43.644
ALLOW ME TO PROPERLY
INTRODUCE MYSELF.

00:43.677 --> 00:47.315
I'M PETER GOLDMAN...

00:47.348 --> 00:49.617
AND, AS I SAID
IN MY LETTER TO YOU,

00:49.650 --> 00:51.852
I GREATLY APPRECIATE YOU

00:51.885 --> 00:55.123
ALLOWING ME TO HANDLE THE APPEAL
OF YOUR DEATH SENTENCE

00:55.156 --> 00:57.358
AND YOUR APPLICATION
FOR A NEW TRIAL.

00:59.127 --> 01:01.629
BUT I'M GONNA NEED
YOUR HELP.

01:01.662 --> 01:04.098
I LOVE HELPING PEOPLE.

01:05.533 --> 01:09.270
SO, TELL ME,
UH, PETER GOLDMAN,

01:09.303 --> 01:11.405
WHAT CAN REGGIE DO
FOR YOU?

01:11.439 --> 01:14.142
I'M TRYING TO PROVE
THAT THE WOMAN

01:14.175 --> 01:17.145
WHO TOOK
YOUR SO-CALLED CONFESSION

01:17.178 --> 01:20.148
IS A CORRUPT
POLICE OFFICER...

01:20.181 --> 01:22.283
AND A MURDERER.

01:24.885 --> 01:26.387
WHAT GOOD IS THAT FOR ME?

01:26.420 --> 01:28.556
REMEMBER THE L.A.P.D.'s
RAMPART SCANDAL?

01:28.589 --> 01:32.393
NEARLY 100 PEOPLE HAD
THEIR CONVICTIONS OVERTURNED

01:32.426 --> 01:34.728
BECAUSE
POLICE OFFICERS LIED.

01:36.564 --> 01:39.200
THAT'S YOUR TICKET
OUT OF HERE.

01:39.233 --> 01:41.602
NOW, WHEN CHIEF JOHNSON
ARRESTED YOU FOR THE MURDER

01:41.635 --> 01:43.637
OF TYRONE BAYLOR
AND TWO OTHER ARMY RANGERS --

01:43.671 --> 01:45.506
WEREN'T NOBODY TRYING TO KILL
TY BAYLOR OR THEM ARMY BOYS.

01:45.539 --> 01:47.441
NO, DON'T SAY THAT.
DON'T ADMIT TO ANYTHING.

01:47.475 --> 01:48.876
JUST LISTEN. LISTEN.
WE WAS AFTER
HIS TWIN BROTHER, TURELL.

01:48.909 --> 01:51.245
YOU LISTEN!!
YOU LISTEN!!

01:52.413 --> 01:54.248
TURELL WALKED
INTO A PROTECTED STORE

01:54.282 --> 01:57.585
AND KILLED THE STORE OWNER
AND HIS LITTLE GRANDSON.

01:57.618 --> 02:00.388
AND THEN HE PUT IT ALL
ON ME.

02:00.421 --> 02:01.655
LOOK AT ME.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.559
LOOK AT ME!!

02:15.536 --> 02:17.571
CHIEF JOHNSON PUT YOU
IN THOSE CHAINS.

02:17.605 --> 02:22.443
AFTER YOUR ARREST,
SHE GAVE YOU A PHONE

02:22.476 --> 02:25.179
SO YOU COULD CALL
ALL YOUR FRIENDS

02:25.213 --> 02:30.951
AND TELL THEM THAT TURELL
WAS BEING LET GO.

02:30.984 --> 02:34.722
"RICKY-ROCK, C-JAZZ,
DELOIN,

02:34.755 --> 02:37.391
AND LIL BUGSY."

02:37.425 --> 02:42.430
AFTER YOU TALKED TO THEM,
TURELL WAS BEATEN TO DEATH.

02:42.463 --> 02:46.166
NOW, I HAVE A WITNESS
WHO CAN TESTIFY TO ALL OF THIS.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.770
HOW YOU KNOW THEM NAMES?

02:49.803 --> 02:55.276
REGGIE, I KNOW EVERYTHING
ABOUT TURELL'S MURDER.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.811
ALL I NEED NOW...

02:57.845 --> 03:00.514
IS FOR PEOPLE
TO SAY WHAT HAPPENED --

03:00.548 --> 03:03.284
OUT LOUD,
IN OPEN COURT.

03:03.317 --> 03:04.818
YOU DO THAT,

03:04.852 --> 03:08.822
AND CHIEF JOHNSON LOSES HER JOB,
HER SAVINGS,

03:08.856 --> 03:10.824
AND EVERYTHING ELSE
SHE HAS.

03:13.427 --> 03:15.429
AND YOU?

03:15.463 --> 03:18.499
YOU WALK OUT OF HERE
A FREE MAN.

03:25.373 --> 03:27.341
WAIT, REGGIE.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

03:27.375 --> 03:29.310
COME BACK
WITH MY PAPERWORK.

03:29.343 --> 03:30.978
REGGIE, IT'S GONNA BE A LOT
HARDER TO GET THE PAPERWORK --

03:31.011 --> 03:33.247
IF IT'S HARD,
THEN YOU DO IT HARD!

03:33.281 --> 03:35.649
DON'T TALK TO ME
ABOUT BEING HARD!

03:38.819 --> 03:39.787
C.O.!

03:46.026 --> 03:48.729
YOU COME BACK
WITH MY PAPERWORK,

03:48.762 --> 03:51.532
AND I'LL SAY ANYTHING
YOU WANT ME TO SAY.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.742
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.610
SIGN IN.
SIGN IN, BOTH OF YOU.

04:36.644 --> 04:39.380
WE GOT TO PLAY THIS ONE
BY THE BOOK.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.718
DEPUTY CHIEF BRENDA LEIGH
JOHNSON, MAJOR CRIMES.

04:44.752 --> 04:47.020
DETECTIVE
DAVID GABRIEL.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.622
WHAT'S GOING ON,
LIEUTENANT?

04:48.656 --> 04:50.023
UH, WE'LL GET
TO THAT LATER.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.459
KENDALL'S COME AND GONE.

04:51.492 --> 04:52.726
WE'LL TAKE A QUICK LOOK
AT THE VICTIM,

04:52.760 --> 04:55.329
EXAMINE HIS I.D.,
PERSONAL EFFECTS,

04:55.363 --> 04:57.931
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE
ALL THIS TOWED OUT OF HERE.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.501
I SEE THE VICTIM
PARKED ILLEGALLY.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.403
IS THAT WHAT MAKES THIS
A MAJOR CRIME?

05:02.436 --> 05:03.737
Flynn: WELL, SORT OF.

05:03.771 --> 05:06.707
UH, PARKING ENFORCEMENT
WAS TICKETING THE CAR

05:06.740 --> 05:08.576
WHEN THEY FOUND THE BODY.

05:08.609 --> 05:11.044
UM, NEWTON ROLLED OUT A COUPLE
OF HOMICIDE DETECTIVES.

05:11.078 --> 05:13.714
THEY RAN THE PLATES.

05:13.747 --> 05:15.048
THEY CALLED TAYLOR.
TAYLOR CALLED US.

05:16.617 --> 05:17.818
WHY?

05:17.851 --> 05:20.488
CAR CAME BACK REGISTERED
TO TURELL BAYLOR.

05:26.026 --> 05:29.763
VICTIM'S DRIVER'S LICENSE SAYS
HIS NAME IS JAMES TURNER.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.732
SHOT FROM THE BACKSEAT,
FOUR TIMES,

05:31.765 --> 05:34.468
I'M GUESSING BETWEEN 1:00
AND 3:00 A.M. THIS MORNING.

05:34.502 --> 05:36.069
NO SHELL CASINGS
FOUND ANYWHERE.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.938
ALL THE BULLETS
ARE IN HIS BODY.

05:37.971 --> 05:40.774
GANG MONIKER DATABASE SAYS
JAMES TURNER GOES BY "J-ROCK."

05:40.808 --> 05:43.677
MEMBER OF THE 110 CRIPS,
CHIEF.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.913
THE 110 CRIPS KILL ANOTHER ONE
OF THEIR OWN

05:45.946 --> 05:47.615
UH, CHIEF?

05:50.518 --> 05:53.020
FOUND THIS CARD
IN THE VICTIM'S POCKET.

05:53.053 --> 05:55.956
PETER GOLDMAN.
ATTORNEY-AT-LAW.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.165
YOU PUT THIS CASE ON HOLD,
RIGHT?

06:05.198 --> 06:06.767
OF COURSE.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.736
I TOLD MY SQUAD TO STAND DOWN
AND GET BREAKFAST.

06:08.769 --> 06:11.972
DO YOU KNOW HOW THE VICTIM ENDED
UP IN TURELL BAYLOR'S CAR?

06:12.005 --> 06:13.707
I KNOW TURELL
WASN'T USING IT.

06:13.741 --> 06:15.876
THIS MURDER DOESN'T NECESSARILY
HAVE ANY CONNECTION

06:15.909 --> 06:17.478
TO THE FEDERAL LAWSUIT.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.480
YES, BUT THE 110 CRIPS

06:19.513 --> 06:22.182
HAVE THEIR OWN ATTORNEYS,
AND GOLDMAN IS NOT ONE OF THEM,

06:22.215 --> 06:24.785
SO WHY WAS HIS CARD FOUND
ON THE VICTIM'S PERSON?

06:24.818 --> 06:26.186
WELL, IN MY BUSINESS,

06:26.219 --> 06:28.556
FINDING THAT CARD ON A BODY
IS WHAT WE CALL A CLUE.

06:28.589 --> 06:30.791
COME IN.

06:30.824 --> 06:33.093
EXCUSE ME.
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

06:33.126 --> 06:35.463
NO PROBLEM, DETECTIVE.
HOW WAS YOUR BREAKFAST?

06:35.496 --> 06:38.999
UH...GREAT.
UH, GOOD.

06:39.032 --> 06:41.835
GOOD. UM...

06:41.869 --> 06:43.203
I-I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF CHIEF JOHNSON

06:43.236 --> 06:44.838
COULD JOIN ME OUT IN THE HALLWAY
FOR A MOMENT.

06:44.872 --> 06:47.040
OH.
NO, NO, NO,
YOU CAN TELL CHIEF JOHNSON

06:47.074 --> 06:49.510
WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO TELL HER
RIGHT IN HERE.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.044
GO AHEAD, DAVID.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.946
OKAY, WELL,
I HAVE A FRIEND

06:52.980 --> 06:54.848
THAT WORKS FOR
A CREDIT RATING AGENCY,

06:54.882 --> 06:58.018
AND I HAD HIM LOOK UP A COUPLE
THINGS FOR ME OFF THE RECORD

06:58.051 --> 07:00.621
JUST TO SEE WHERE PETER GOLDMAN
HAS BEEN LATELY.

07:00.654 --> 07:02.222
OH, MY GOD. YOU CAN'T GET
INSIDE INFORMATION...

07:02.255 --> 07:03.957
IT'S NOT TRACEABLE.
...ON THE PLAINTIFF'S
ATTORNEY.

07:03.991 --> 07:05.526
IT'S NOT TRACEABLE.
YOU SIMPLY CAN'T DO THAT.

07:05.559 --> 07:06.794
WELL, NOW WE ALL KNOW ABOUT IT,
DON'T WE?

07:06.827 --> 07:08.629
OR WE WOULD
IF YOU'D LET HIM FINISH.

07:10.063 --> 07:11.565
DETECTIVE.

07:11.599 --> 07:13.000
THANK YOU.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.868
YESTERDAY, GOLDMAN TOOK A FLIGHT
UP TO OAKLAND.

07:14.902 --> 07:17.871
AND HE RENTED A CAR
WITH ONE OF THOSE TOLL PASSES,

07:17.905 --> 07:20.641
AND HE USED IT TO DRIVE
OVER THE SAN RAFAEL BRIDGE.

07:20.674 --> 07:22.976
HE WENT TO SAN QUENTIN?
WHY?

07:23.010 --> 07:27.247
HE SIGNED IN AS ATTORNEY
FOR REGGIE MOSES.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.917
GOLDMAN SPOKE
TO REGGIE MOSES?

07:29.950 --> 07:31.485
YEAH, ALONE.

07:31.519 --> 07:33.721
AND AFTERWARDS,
REGGIE MADE A PHONE CALL.

07:35.055 --> 07:37.625
TO WHOM?

07:37.658 --> 07:38.926
Buzz: SAN QUENTIN SENT US
AN AUDIO FILE

07:38.959 --> 07:40.961
OF REGGIE CALLING
FROM A PRISON PHONE

07:40.994 --> 07:42.262
TO SOMEONE
ON A DISPOSABLE CELL.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.031
YEAH, I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT

07:44.064 --> 07:46.834
WHERE THAT DISPOSABLE CELL
WAS SOLD AND WHO BOUGHT IT.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.003
Man:
HELLO?

07:50.037 --> 07:51.004
Reggie: HEY, DAWG.

07:51.038 --> 07:53.140
SAW MY NEW LAWYER TODAY.

07:53.173 --> 07:54.608
PETER GOLDMAN.

07:54.642 --> 07:57.778
GONNA FILE AN APPEAL
FOR ME.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.648
HE HAS FIVE INVESTIGATORS
RESEARCHING MY CASE.

08:00.681 --> 08:03.817
ONE OF THEM
TALKS TOO MUCH.

08:03.851 --> 08:06.219
THANKS, MAN.
STAY CHILL.

08:06.253 --> 08:09.122
FIVE INVESTIGATORS.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.058
YEAH, AND ONE OF THEM
TALKS TOO MUCH.

08:11.091 --> 08:12.560
J-ROCK.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.161
IT IMPLIES
GOLDMAN HAS A LIST OF NAMES

08:14.194 --> 08:15.596
PERTINENT TO THE CASE.

08:15.629 --> 08:17.030
HE NEEDS TO BE INTERVIEWED
IMMEDIATELY.

08:17.064 --> 08:18.832
THAT'S WHAT
I'VE BEEN SAYING.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.701
NOT BY YOU OR ANYONE ELSE
IN THIS DIVISION.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.703
YOU'RE ALL BEING SUED.

08:22.736 --> 08:24.004
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, WHO DO YOU HAVE IN MIND?

08:30.878 --> 08:33.714
HELLO, PETER.

08:33.747 --> 08:35.282
OOH. LOVE THE TIE.

08:35.315 --> 08:37.885
I HAVE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT YOU SO MUCH.

08:37.918 --> 08:40.153
IT'S ALMOST A RELIEF
TO BE ABLE TO SIT DOWN

08:40.187 --> 08:41.722
AND TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.190
WELL, I'M NOT ANSWERING
ANY QUESTIONS

08:43.223 --> 08:44.825
ABOUT HOW I'M GETTING
MY INFORMATION

08:44.858 --> 08:45.826
FROM INSIDE THE L.A.P.D.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.028
AND INTERROGATING ME

08:48.061 --> 08:50.598
ON ANY SUBJECT COULD BE
INTERPRETED BY A FEDERAL JUDGE

08:50.631 --> 08:51.999
AS A FORM OF HARASSMENT.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.734
SO YOU'D BETTER HAVE
A DAMN GOOD REASON

08:53.767 --> 08:56.236
FOR PUTTING ME
IN AN INTERVIEW ROOM.

08:56.269 --> 08:59.106
OH. I DO.

08:59.139 --> 09:03.110
THE MURDER OF JAMES TURNER,
A.K.A. J-ROCK,

09:03.143 --> 09:07.014
AND YOUR BUSINESS CARD,
WHICH WE FOUND ON HIS BODY.

09:17.858 --> 09:19.359
SO,
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME

09:19.392 --> 09:23.664
YOU SPOKE WITH OR SAW
JAMES TURNER, A.K.A. J

09:25.132 --> 09:27.701
THAT IS NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

09:27.735 --> 09:30.070
OKAY, THEN...

09:30.103 --> 09:31.839
WHERE YOU WERE
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON?

09:31.872 --> 09:33.340
ALSO NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

09:33.373 --> 09:35.108
MIGHT YOU HAVE BEEN
AT SAN QUENTIN PRISON

09:35.142 --> 09:37.611
VISITING REGGIE MOSES
ON DEATH ROW?

09:37.645 --> 09:39.713
IF I FIND OUT
THE L.A.P.D.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.214
HAS BEEN ILLEGALLY MONITORING
MY WHEREABOUTS --
WAIT. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

09:41.248 --> 09:42.616
BEFORE YOU START
HUFFING AND PUFFING

09:42.650 --> 09:44.084
AND TRYING TO BLOW
MY HOUSE DOWN,

09:44.117 --> 09:47.655
YOU SIGNED IN TO
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, PETER.

09:47.688 --> 09:49.122
IT'S A MATTER
OF PUBLIC RECORD.

09:49.156 --> 09:50.891
NOW...

09:50.924 --> 09:53.026
YOU SPOKE WITH REGGIE MOSES,
A 110 CRIP.

09:53.060 --> 09:55.028
AFTERWARDS,
HE MADE A PHONE CALL,

09:55.062 --> 09:57.831
AND THEN ANOTHER 110 CRIP,
J-ROCK, ENDED UP DEAD.

09:57.865 --> 09:59.366
REGGIE IS IN PRISON.

09:59.399 --> 10:00.834
SO HE DIDN'T SHOOT ANYONE.

10:00.868 --> 10:04.204
NOW, IF YOU WANT SOMEONE
WHO'S OUT AND ABOUT,

10:04.237 --> 10:06.206
WITH A GOOD MOTIVE
TO KILL J-ROCK,

10:06.239 --> 10:09.342
WHY DON'T YOU BEGIN
RIGHT HERE?

10:09.376 --> 10:10.978
WITH THE L.A.P.D.

10:11.011 --> 10:14.081
GIVE ME A REASON,
AND I WILL.

10:15.348 --> 10:18.351
J-ROCK WAS A WITNESS
TO THE DEATH OF TURELL BAYLOR.

10:20.287 --> 10:23.891
HE SAW IT HAPPEN.
AND I FOUND HIM.

10:23.924 --> 10:26.994
NOT YOU GUYS -- ME.

10:27.027 --> 10:28.128
AND HOW DID THAT WORK OUT?

10:28.161 --> 10:30.263
AND NOW HE'S DEAD.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.032
KIND OF COINCIDENTAL,
DON'T YOU THINK?

10:32.065 --> 10:34.001
J-ROCK WAS A WITNESS
TO TURELL BAYLOR'S DEATH?

10:34.034 --> 10:35.669
YES.

10:35.703 --> 10:37.070
AND HE GAVE YOU THE NAMES
OF TURELL'S MURDERERS?

10:37.104 --> 10:39.339
NO. NO.

10:39.372 --> 10:43.410
JUST THAT -- JUST THAT
THEY WERE ALL 110 CRIPS.

10:43.443 --> 10:44.812
I'M CONFUSED.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.747
YOU'RE SAYING THE VICTIM

10:46.780 --> 10:49.249
CONFIRMED HIS FELLOW CRIPS
MURDERED TURELL,

10:49.282 --> 10:52.452
BUT HE COULDN'T IDENTIFY
HIS OWN GANG MEMBERS? SO --

10:52.485 --> 10:54.788
SO WHAT DID YOU GO TO
SAN QUENTIN PRISON FOR, PETER?

10:54.822 --> 10:57.758
DURING YOUR LITTLE INTERVIEW
WITH REGGIE MOSES,

10:57.791 --> 10:59.159
DID YOU HAPPEN TO MENTION
THAT YOU HAD A WITNESS

10:59.192 --> 11:00.761
TO TURELL BAYLOR'S DEATH?

11:00.794 --> 11:04.798
MY CONVERSATION WITH REGGIE
IS COVERED BY PRIVILEGE.

11:04.832 --> 11:06.466
YOU KNOW, MAJOR CRIMES
WOULD HAVE A MUCH BETTER TIME

11:06.499 --> 11:09.703
SOLVING J-ROCK'S MURDER IF YOU
WOULD JUST GIVE OVER THE NAMES

11:09.737 --> 11:13.106
OF THE 110 CRIPS THAT YOUR
WITNESS ALLEGEDLY CONFIRMED!
I DON'T KNOW THEM, ALL RIGHT?
I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU THAT!

11:13.140 --> 11:14.708
ARE YOU DEAF?!

11:14.742 --> 11:16.043
LET ME REPEAT IT FOR YOU.

11:16.076 --> 11:19.112
J-ROCK GAVE ME NO NAMES.
OKAY?

11:19.146 --> 11:21.014
I HAVE NO NAMES!
NONE!

11:23.116 --> 11:26.386
OKAY.

11:28.055 --> 11:30.758
WAIT HERE.

11:35.128 --> 11:38.766
IS THIS MY CASE?
I NEED TO KNOW.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.934
YES. YES.
IT'S YOUR CASE.

11:42.402 --> 11:43.937
THE QUESTION NOW IS

11:43.971 --> 11:45.839
WHETHER OR NOT GOLDMAN
IS WITHHOLDING THOSE NAMES.

11:45.873 --> 11:47.941
OF COURSE HE'S WITHHOLDING THE
NAMES, BUT WE CAN'T PROVE IT.

11:47.975 --> 11:51.211
PERHAPS IF HE HEARD
THE CONVERSATION REGGIE
HAD AFTER THEIR VISIT.

11:51.244 --> 11:53.914
WELL, NOT UNTIL WE KNOW
WHO WAS ON THE OTHER
END OF THAT CALL.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.248
DETECTIVE?
YES, SIR.

11:55.282 --> 11:57.384
I WAS ABLE TO TRACK
THE DISPOSABLE CELLPHONE

11:57.417 --> 11:59.820
THAT REGGIE CALLED TO A
DISTRIBUTION CENTER IN SEATTLE,

11:59.853 --> 12:02.422
BUT I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO FIND
OUT WHERE IT WENT FROM THERE.

12:02.455 --> 12:05.392
Brenda: MR. GOLDMAN, I HEARD
YOU WERE IN THE BUILDING.

12:05.425 --> 12:07.027
I'M SO GLAD
YOU DIDN'T LEAVE

12:07.060 --> 12:08.495
BEFORE WE HAD THE CHANCE
TO SAY HELLO.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.831
DON'T THINK THAT THIS MURDER
IS GONNA STOP ME

12:10.864 --> 12:12.432
FROM MOVING FORWARD
ON THE LAWSUIT --

12:12.465 --> 12:14.067
BECAUSE IT WON'T.

12:14.101 --> 12:15.869
ALL RIGHT, DETECTIVE,
LET'S STAY AFTER THAT PHONE,

12:15.903 --> 12:17.404
SEE WHAT WE CAN DO
ABOUT GETTING A WIRE ON IT.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.139
YES, SIR.
CAN WE JUST CUT
TO THE CHASE HERE?

12:19.172 --> 12:20.373
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

12:20.407 --> 12:22.209
THE SAME THING YOU WANT,
MR. GOLDMAN --

12:22.242 --> 12:24.144
TO FIND THE PEOPLE
WHO KILLED J-ROCK.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.979
WHO, FROM WHAT YOU JUST TOLD
CAPTAIN RAYDOR,

12:26.013 --> 12:29.049
ARE PROBABLY THE SAME CREW
WHO KILLED TURELL BAYLOR.

12:30.818 --> 12:33.821
YOU DON'T ACTUALLY EXPECT ME
TO BELIEVE YOU CARE ABOUT THAT,

12:33.854 --> 12:35.155
DO YOU?

12:35.188 --> 12:36.790
IF YOU ARREST
TURELL'S KILLERS,

12:36.824 --> 12:39.392
YOU'LL END UP MAKING MY CASE
AGAINST YOU.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.894
IF YOU KNOW THE NAMES
OF THESE PEOPLE,

12:40.928 --> 12:42.462
YOU'D BETTER TELL ME
WHO THEY ARE

12:42.495 --> 12:45.132
BEFORE THEY DO TO YOU
WHAT THEY DID TO J-ROCK.

12:45.165 --> 12:48.268
OH. SORRY.

12:48.301 --> 12:52.005
YOUR USUAL SCARE TACTICS
WOULDN'T WORK WITH ME

12:52.039 --> 12:54.808
EVEN IF I KNEW THE NAMES,
WHICH I DON'T.

12:54.842 --> 12:56.944
NOW IF YOU'LL PARDON ME,

12:56.977 --> 12:59.379
I'M SURE YOU HAVE OTHER PEOPLE
YOU WANT TO TRY INTIMIDATING,

12:59.412 --> 13:00.814
AND I HAVE WORK TO DO.

13:00.848 --> 13:03.283
PLEASE. LOOK, WAIT.
WAIT A MINUTE.

13:03.316 --> 13:05.552
IF YOU'RE DETERMINED TO LEAVE
HERE WITHOUT HELPING ME,

13:05.585 --> 13:07.520
AT LEAST LET ME OFFER YOU
SOME PROTECTION.

13:07.554 --> 13:09.957
OH, WOULD THAT BE
THE SAME KIND OF PROTECTION

13:09.990 --> 13:11.358
YOU OFFERED
TURELL BAYLOR?

13:11.391 --> 13:15.028
WOULD YOU ALSO LIKE
TO GIVE ME A LIFT HOME?

13:15.062 --> 13:17.564
AT LEAST I'D KNOW WHERE
TO START LOOKING FOR YOU

13:17.597 --> 13:20.000
WHEN YOU DON'T SHOW UP
FOR WORK TOMORROW.

13:20.033 --> 13:22.970
I'M NOT AFRAID.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.505
YES, YOU ARE.

13:36.116 --> 13:38.451
WELL  IF GOLDMAN
DOES KNOW THOSE NAMES...

13:38.485 --> 13:41.188
HE DOES.

13:41.221 --> 13:42.422
...AND WE CAN PROVE IT,

13:42.455 --> 13:44.424
I THINK I CAN
FORCE HIM TO SETTLE.

13:44.457 --> 13:46.426
CHIEF JOHNSON WON'T SETTLE,
GAVIN.

13:46.459 --> 13:49.863
SHE WANTS TO BE CLEARED
IN COURT.

13:49.897 --> 13:53.333
AH. WELL.
GOOD TO KNOW.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.379
SO, WHERE'S THE REST
OF YOUR SQUAD NOW?

14:06.413 --> 14:07.948
STILL AT BREAKFAST?

14:07.981 --> 14:09.482
AT THE PRINT SHED.

14:09.516 --> 14:12.052
AH.

14:12.085 --> 14:15.355
OKAY, LOOK --
SOLVING THE MURDER IS JOB ONE.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.124
JOB TWO IS MAKING SURE

14:17.157 --> 14:19.326
THAT GOLDMAN DOESN'T WIND UP
DEAD IN THE PROCESS.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.528
AND I...I THINK
YOU NEED TO ADDRESS

14:21.561 --> 14:23.296
THE LEAK
IN YOUR DIVISION OPENLY.

14:23.330 --> 14:24.965
SO, FIND THE KILLER,

14:24.998 --> 14:28.068
BUT BE AWARE OF ALL
THE MOVING PIECES ON THE BOARD.

14:38.178 --> 14:41.414
YOU NOTIFY
J

14:41.448 --> 14:44.017
THEY KNEW HE WAS DEAD
BEFORE I GOT THERE.

14:44.051 --> 14:45.518
WELL, DID ANY OF THEM
TELL YOU

14:45.552 --> 14:47.420
WHY HE WAS DRIVING
TURELL BAYLOR'S CAR?

14:47.454 --> 14:49.089
WELL,
THEY WERE FRIENDS.

14:49.122 --> 14:50.357
TURELL'S MOTHER LOANED IT
TO HIM

14:50.390 --> 14:52.492
SORRY WE'RE LATE.
WHAT DID WE MISS?

14:52.525 --> 14:54.627
WELL, NOT MUCH.
MORALES CALLED.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.629
SAYS HE'S PULLED A LOT
OF 9mm BULLETS

14:56.663 --> 14:58.065
OUT OF J-ROCK'S BACK.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.467
J-ROCK'S PHONE
HAS ABOUT A DOZEN CALLS

15:00.500 --> 15:03.937
BETWEEN HIM AND GOLDMAN'S OFFICE
AND CELL,

15:03.971 --> 15:05.638
SO THEY WERE DEFINITELY
IN TOUCH.

15:05.672 --> 15:08.275
OKAY. UM...

15:08.308 --> 15:09.609
COULD EVERYONE,
UH, GATHER 'ROUND?

15:09.642 --> 15:10.978
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY
ABOUT THIS CASE

15:11.011 --> 15:12.345
BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER.

15:12.379 --> 15:14.381
AT THE MOMENT, IT LOOKS LIKE
J-ROCK WAS KILLED

15:14.414 --> 15:17.317
BECAUSE HE WAS WILLING
TO TESTIFY IN FEDERAL COURT

15:17.350 --> 15:19.987
ABOUT THE MURDER
OF TURELL BAYLOR.

15:20.020 --> 15:21.521
IT WOULD ALSO APPEAR,
THOUGH GOLDMAN DENIES IT,

15:21.554 --> 15:25.158
THAT J-ROCK GAVE HIM THE NAMES
OF TURELL'S MURDERERS.

15:25.192 --> 15:27.527
IF THAT'S TRUE,
GOLDMAN IS IN DANGER.

15:27.560 --> 15:30.697
SO, UM, AT THE MOMENT,

15:30.730 --> 15:32.365
I'M ASKING THAT EVERYONE
KEEP A TIGHT LID

15:32.399 --> 15:35.102
ON THE INFORMATION IN THIS CASE,
FOR GOLDMAN'S SAKE.

15:35.135 --> 15:36.203
OKAY?

15:36.236 --> 15:39.106
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE,
CHIEF.

15:39.139 --> 15:41.408
IF GOLDMAN KNOWS THE KILLERS'
NAMES AND HE'S NOT TELLING US,

15:41.441 --> 15:43.010
THEN THAT'S HIS PROBLEM,
NOT OURS.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.744
Gabriel: WELL,
I'M NOT SURE THAT A JUDGE

15:44.777 --> 15:46.546
WOULD LOOK AT IT THAT WAY,
LIEUTENANT.

15:46.579 --> 15:48.381
WELL, I DON'T GIVE A DAMN
WHAT SOME JUDGE LOOKS AT.

15:48.415 --> 15:50.283
MOVING ON WITH THE DETAILS
OF OUR MURDER, GENTLEMEN.

15:50.317 --> 15:52.352
I JUST SPOKE
WITH THE NEWTON DETECTIVES

15:52.385 --> 15:55.522
WHO HAVE BEEN LOOKING
INTO TURELL'S DEATH.

15:55.555 --> 15:58.191
THEY CONFIRM THAT HE AND J-ROCK
WERE GOOD FRIENDS,

15:58.225 --> 15:59.459
SO IT MAKES SENSE
THAT MRS. BAYLOR

15:59.492 --> 16:01.128
WOULD GIVE HIM THE CAR.

16:01.161 --> 16:03.730
Tao: AND WE'VE PULLED A LOT
OF PRINTS OUT OF IT.

16:03.763 --> 16:06.199
BAYLOR'S, OF COURSE,
J-ROCK'S,

16:06.233 --> 16:08.535
SOME PARTIALS,
SOME UNIDENTIFIED,

16:08.568 --> 16:11.104
SIX OTHER GANG MEMBERS
AND MORE TO GO.

16:11.138 --> 16:13.373
INSIDE THE CAR
MEANS INSIDE JOB.

16:13.406 --> 16:17.077
HERE, CHIEF.
LET ME SHOW YOU.

16:21.114 --> 16:22.749
STEP IN HERE?

16:26.219 --> 16:31.291
UH, UH, BUZZ HAS AN AUDIO FILE
Y'ALL NEED TO HEAR.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.625
BUZZ.

16:43.803 --> 16:47.274
SO,
THE SHOOTER SAT HERE.

16:47.307 --> 16:49.809
THE CAR PULLS OVER TO THE CURB.
HE TAKES OUT HIS GUN.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.145
LEFT-HANDED.
POW, POW, POW, POW.

16:52.179 --> 16:54.814
PICKS UP THE CASINGS.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.317
THEN HE AND THE GUY UP FRONT
JUMP OUT.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.352
THE IMPORTANT THING HERE,
CHIEF --

16:59.386 --> 17:02.189
J-ROCK WAS KILLED
BY HIS OWN GANG.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.623
LIKE TURELL?

17:03.656 --> 17:05.158
LIKE TURELL.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.160
AND THAT'S NOT DONE
WITHOUT PERMISSION.

17:07.194 --> 17:12.599
SO WHO'S THE SHOT-CALLER
INSIDE THE 110 CRIPS?

17:12.632 --> 17:14.567
IS THERE A WAY
TO FOLLOW THE MONEY TRAIL

17:14.601 --> 17:15.835
ON AN INSIDE
GANG KILLING?

17:15.868 --> 17:17.837
IT'S AN ALL-CASH BUSINESS.

17:17.870 --> 17:22.209
WE COULD LOOK BACK TO SEE
IF ANY OF THE 110 CRIPS

17:22.242 --> 17:25.578
SPENT A LOT OF MONEY
AFTER TURELL DIED.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.514
BUT THAT'S ONLY GONNA HELP YOU
GET THE KIDS

17:27.547 --> 17:29.649
THAT DID THE DIRTY WORK
AND NOT THE GUY IN CHARGE.

17:29.682 --> 17:31.851
IF WHOEVER ORDERED THE HIT
ON J-ROCK

17:31.884 --> 17:33.753
ALSO ORDERED THE HIT
ON TURELL,

17:33.786 --> 17:35.822
THEN ALL THIS VIOLENCE
GOES BACK

17:35.855 --> 17:38.691
TO THE CONVENIENCE STORE
TURELL ROBBED.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.728
THE OWNER AND HIS GRANDSON
THAT HE SHOT TO DEATH.

17:41.761 --> 17:44.231
LOOKING AT THAT STORE.
IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

17:44.264 --> 17:46.699
IT WAS PROTECTED.

17:46.733 --> 17:49.369
THERE'S GOT TO BE A REASON
FOR THAT.

17:49.402 --> 17:51.704
MAYBE WE SHOULD ALSO FIND OUT
WHO PAID FOR THE FUNERALS

17:51.738 --> 17:53.606
OF THAT POOR OLD MAN
AND THE LITTLE BOY.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.843
NOT "WE." "YOU."

17:56.876 --> 17:58.845
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

17:58.878 --> 18:00.480
CHIEF...

18:00.513 --> 18:01.814
GOLDMAN'S HERE,
IN THIS PRINT SHED RIGHT NOW.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.483
EVERYTHING THAT YOU SAY

18:03.516 --> 18:05.652
AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO
WILL GET BACK TO HIM.

18:07.387 --> 18:10.157
YOU NEED TO FOLLOW UP
WITHOUT US.

18:14.227 --> 18:17.530
WHEN YOU'RE NOT SURE
WHO YOU CAN TRUST, CHIEF,

18:17.564 --> 18:19.832
DON'T TRUST ANYONE.

18:19.866 --> 18:23.570
BUT, JULIO...

18:23.603 --> 18:25.872
THESE PEOPLE
ARE MY FRIENDS.

18:25.905 --> 18:29.776
THAT'S WHAT J-ROCK
WAS THINKING...

19:00.307 --> 19:00.973
Fritz:
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

19:03.376 --> 19:05.445
YOU SURE YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE?

19:05.478 --> 19:07.447
BECAUSE I THINK
THIS CASE COULD PRESENT

19:07.480 --> 19:09.249
A CONFLICT OF INTEREST
FOR YOU.

19:09.282 --> 19:12.285
IT'S A CONFLICT OF INTEREST
FOR EVERYONE BUT ME.

19:12.319 --> 19:14.354
BESIDES...

19:14.387 --> 19:17.490
I'VE COME UP WITH A PLAN
THAT I THINK COVERS EVERYTHING.

19:17.524 --> 19:18.691
IT'S NOT SUICIDE, IS IT?

19:18.725 --> 19:20.260
HA HA.

19:20.293 --> 19:22.562
BECAUSE ARRESTING THE GUYS
WHO KILLED TURELL BAYLOR

19:22.595 --> 19:23.863
COULD END UP
COSTING YOU BIG-TIME.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.665
WELL, WHICH WOULD YOU
RATHER I GIVE UP...

19:25.698 --> 19:28.301
EVERYTHING
I HAVE OR EVERYTHING I AM?

19:28.335 --> 19:31.438
WHAT'S BEHIND
DOOR NUMBER 3?

19:31.471 --> 19:32.439
ANYTHING?

19:35.908 --> 19:38.745
DADDY'S SICK.

19:38.778 --> 19:41.381
I'M ALL PACKED UP FOR MY TRIP
TO ATLANTA.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.583
IF I LOSE MY JOB OVER THIS,
SO BE IT.

19:43.616 --> 19:44.851
I'LL KEEP BUSY.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.753
IN THE MEANTIME...

19:46.786 --> 19:51.291
...THAT CONVENIENCE-STORE OWNER
THAT TURELL BAYLOR KILLED --

19:51.324 --> 19:54.227
CHARLIE NILES -- YOU FIND OUT
ANYTHING ABOUT HIM?

19:54.261 --> 19:56.729
HIS DAUGHTER SOLD
HER FATHER'S CONVENIENCE STORE

19:56.763 --> 19:58.865
FOR ABOUT THREE TIMES
WHAT IT'S WORTH.

19:58.898 --> 20:01.934
WELL, THAT'S A GOOD DEAL.
ANY IDEA WHO BOUGHT IT?

20:02.935 --> 20:06.639
MYMA INDUSTRIES.

20:06.673 --> 20:09.476
THEY CONVERTED CHARLIE NILES'
CONVENIENCE STORE

20:09.509 --> 20:12.612
INTO A CELLPHONE BUSINESS --
PAPA ELECTRONICS.

20:12.645 --> 20:13.946
CELLPHONES?

20:13.980 --> 20:15.682
UH-HUH.

20:15.715 --> 20:18.351
AND MYMA HAS A WAREHOUSE
IN SEATTLE.

20:18.385 --> 20:19.619
THAT'S WHERE
WE LOST CONTACT

20:19.652 --> 20:21.288
WITH THE PRE-PAID NUMBER
THAT REGGIE CALLED.

20:21.321 --> 20:23.556
MYMA INDUSTRIES -- I ASSUME
THAT'S A SHELL COMPANY?

20:23.590 --> 20:25.558
ANY IDEA WHO OWNS IT?

20:25.592 --> 20:28.861
HIS NAME...
IS MARVIN EVANS.

20:28.895 --> 20:31.631
NOW, NOT ONLY
DOES HE LIKE OVERPAYING

20:31.664 --> 20:33.400
FOR CONVENIENCE STORES
IN GANG TERRITORY,

20:33.433 --> 20:35.368
BUT WHEN I STOPPED BY
THE MORTUARY

20:35.402 --> 20:37.704
LISTED ON CHARLIE NILES'
DEATH CERTIFICATE,

20:37.737 --> 20:39.972
GUESS WHO COVERED THE COST
OF THE FUNERAL.

20:40.006 --> 20:42.041
MARVIN.
DEAD RIGHT.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.511
OH, AND DOES HE COME
FROM THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD

20:44.544 --> 20:45.878
AS THE 110 CRIPS?

20:45.912 --> 20:47.314
GREW UP ONE BLOCK AWAY
FROM THE BAYLORS' HOUSE.

20:47.347 --> 20:48.815
NOW HERE'S THE KICKER.

20:48.848 --> 20:51.584
THIS GUY ALSO SEEMS TO BE
SOMETHING OF A FINANCIAL WIZARD.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.286
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

20:53.320 --> 20:54.721
HE PUT TOGETHER
MYMA INDUSTRIES,

20:54.754 --> 20:56.055
WHICH OWNS
15 CELL COMPANIES

20:56.088 --> 20:58.825
IN CALIFORNIA, HAWAII,
AND NEVADA.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.793
HE LIVES IN
A PRICEY DOWNTOWN CONDO,

21:00.827 --> 21:03.763
HE'S GOT A 4,400-SQUARE-FOOT
VACATION HOME IN PALM SPRINGS,

21:03.796 --> 21:05.598
SIX CARS,
ONE OF WHICH IS A BENTLEY,

21:05.632 --> 21:09.736
AND HE PUT ALL THAT TOGETHER
WITH CASH HE INVESTED

21:09.769 --> 21:12.939
FROM BUYING AND SELLING
UNCLAIMED LUGGAGE.

21:12.972 --> 21:16.709
WISE INVESTOR.
LOTS OF MONEY.

21:16.743 --> 21:18.077
AN INTEREST
IN HIS OLD NEIGHBORHOOD.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.546
SOUNDS LIKE
A SHOT-CALLER TO ME.

21:19.579 --> 21:21.681
NOW LISTEN --

21:21.714 --> 21:23.082
THIS GUY HAS EXCELLENT
LEGAL REPRESENTATION.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.917
I DON'T THINK HE'S GONNA TALK
TO YOU FOR VERY LONG.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.819
I DON'T NEED HIM TO TALK TO ME.
I JUST NEED HIM TO LISTEN.

21:26.853 --> 21:30.457
AND BE OUT OF HIS DOWNTOWN CONDO
FOR AT LEAST...

21:31.591 --> 21:34.427
UM...
AT LEAST 30 MINUTES?

21:34.461 --> 21:35.462
30 MINUTES?!

21:35.495 --> 21:36.763
HE HAS DOGS.

21:37.630 --> 21:42.001
OKAY. OKAY.
I CAN...MANAGE 30 MINUTES.

21:42.034 --> 21:44.671
LOOK, THANK YOU.

21:44.704 --> 21:47.674
THANK YOU.

21:47.707 --> 21:49.108
HONESTLY,
IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU...

21:49.141 --> 21:50.910
I DON'T THINK

21:50.943 --> 21:53.613
I'D HAVE A SINGLE SOUL ON EARTH
I COULD TRUST RIGHT NOW.

21:53.646 --> 21:54.947
I REALLY DON'T.

21:54.981 --> 21:57.884
I'M GLAD I FINALLY BECAME
THE KIND OF PERSON

21:57.917 --> 21:59.419
PEOPLE CAN COUNT ON.

22:01.688 --> 22:03.490
AND I DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH OF A FAVOR

22:03.523 --> 22:04.991
I AM ACTUALLY
DOING FOR YOU,

22:05.024 --> 22:07.894
BECAUSE THE SECOND MARVIN EVANS
SHOWS UP IN YOUR DIVISION,

22:07.927 --> 22:09.829
GOLDMAN IS GONNA
FIND OUT ABOUT IT.

22:09.862 --> 22:13.600
GOSH, HONEY.
I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.103
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

22:17.136 --> 22:19.406
HOW COULD YOU SET UP
AN S.I.S. PROTECTION DETAIL

22:19.439 --> 22:21.374
FOR GOLDMAN
WITHOUT MY PERMISSION?

22:21.408 --> 22:23.710
I DIDN'T ORDER S.I.S. PROTECTION
FOR ANYONE.

22:23.743 --> 22:25.812
IT'S SURVEILLANCE ONLY,
AND I REQUESTED IT.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.013
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

22:27.046 --> 22:28.881
I'M CHIEF OF POLICE
FOR NOW,

22:28.915 --> 22:30.149
AND I HAVE APPROVAL
OVER THIS.
EXCUSE ME.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.618
EXCUSE ME.

22:31.651 --> 22:33.019
I HAVE A VERY GOOD
EXPLANATION

22:33.052 --> 22:34.487
FOR WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

22:34.521 --> 22:35.722
AND THAT WOULD BE?

22:35.755 --> 22:36.823
CHIEF JOHNSON
IS ABOUT TO MEET

22:36.856 --> 22:38.057
WITH THE MAN
THAT SHE BELIEVES

22:38.090 --> 22:39.692
RUNS THE 110 CRIPS,
MARVIN EVANS.

22:39.726 --> 22:41.561
IF, IN MY INTERVIEW
WITH MR. EVANS,

22:41.594 --> 22:42.995
I INADVERTENTLY
SAY SOMETHING

22:43.029 --> 22:44.897
THAT PUTS MR. GOLDMAN
IN DANGER --

22:44.931 --> 22:47.099
AN S.I.S. DETAIL WILL ALREADY
BE THERE TO PROTECT HIM.

22:47.133 --> 22:49.536
THERE WILL BE NO MOMENT

22:49.569 --> 22:50.937
BETWEEN THE CREATION
OF A THREAT

22:50.970 --> 22:52.605
AND THE SURVEILLANCE.

22:52.639 --> 22:54.641
YOU KNOW IN ADVANCE
THAT TALKING TO THIS GUY

22:54.674 --> 22:55.908
THREATENS GOLDMAN'S LIFE,

22:55.942 --> 22:57.043
AND YOU'RE GONNA GO AHEAD
AND DO IT?

22:57.076 --> 22:58.177
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?!

22:58.210 --> 23:00.680
YOU SAID,
"SOLVE THE MURDER,

23:00.713 --> 23:02.515
AND THEN BE AWARE
OF ALL THE MOVING PIECES."

23:02.549 --> 23:03.883
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING.

23:03.916 --> 23:05.084
IF YOU HAVE ANOTHER PLAN,
I'M OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS.

23:05.117 --> 23:06.786
COME IN!

23:06.819 --> 23:09.055
UH...OH.

23:09.856 --> 23:12.425
UH...
GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE.

23:12.459 --> 23:14.026
GOOD MORNING, LIEUTENANT.
WHAT IS IT?

23:14.060 --> 23:16.529
A MARVIN EVANS IS DOWNSTAIRS
WITH HIS ATTORNEY --

23:16.563 --> 23:17.930
A CHINESE GUY.

23:17.964 --> 23:20.099
HE SAID YOU ASKED HIM TO COME IN
TO TALK TO YOU.

23:20.132 --> 23:21.534
FLYNN'S BRINGING THEM UP.

23:21.568 --> 23:22.769
I TOLD THEM
INTERVIEW ROOM TWO.

23:22.802 --> 23:24.871
GREAT. THANK YOU.
I'M COMING WITH YOU.

23:35.882 --> 23:38.885
OKAY, CHIEF, WE'VE GOT A WIRE
UP AND RUNNING

23:38.918 --> 23:41.120
ON THE DISPOSABLE
CELLPHONE

23:41.153 --> 23:42.922
THAT REGGIE MOSES CALLED
FROM SAN QUENTIN.

23:42.955 --> 23:45.525
AND WE'VE IDENTIFIED MOST
OF THE PRINTS FROM THE CAR.

23:45.558 --> 23:47.226
YEAH, IT'S TOO MUCH
OF A GOOD THING, REALLY.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.128
THERE WERE AT LEAST 12 CRIPS
IN THAT BUICK

23:49.161 --> 23:51.097
AT ONE POINT OR ANOTHER
THAT WE KNOW OF.

23:51.130 --> 23:53.533
Provenza: YEAH,
WE CAN BRING THEM ALL IN,

23:53.566 --> 23:55.201
FIND OUT WHO HAS AN
ALIBI FOR THE TIME
OUR VICTIM WAS SHOT.

23:55.234 --> 23:58.571
WE WON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.
WHY NOT?

23:58.605 --> 24:00.072
GOLDMAN'S GONNA COME BACK IN

24:00.106 --> 24:01.508
AND GIVE US THE NAMES OF
THOSE KILLERS SOMETIME TODAY.

24:01.541 --> 24:02.975
IN THE MEANTIME,
WILL YOU PLEASE MAKE SURE

24:03.009 --> 24:05.144
THAT EVERYONE MAKES IT
INTO ELECTRONICS?

24:05.177 --> 24:07.580
I WANT ALL OF YOU
WATCHING THIS INTERVIEW.

24:07.614 --> 24:09.849
EXCUSE ME.

24:13.219 --> 24:15.955
SANCHEZ!

24:15.988 --> 24:17.790
TAO!

24:24.597 --> 24:26.232
LIEUTENANT, THANK YOU.

24:26.265 --> 24:30.269
MR. EVANS, SO NICE TO PUT A FACE
TO THE VOICE.

24:30.302 --> 24:31.838
I'M DEPUTY CHIEF JOHNSON,

24:31.871 --> 24:34.106
AND YOU MUST BE
MR. EVANS' ATTORNEY.

24:34.140 --> 24:35.842
TOMMY WONG.
TOMMY WONG.

24:35.875 --> 24:37.176
SO NICE TO MEET YOU BOTH.

24:37.209 --> 24:39.045
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR COMING.

24:39.078 --> 24:40.279
DON'T THANK US.

24:40.312 --> 24:41.180
WE HAVE NO INTENTION
OF COOPERATING

24:41.213 --> 24:42.615
WITH YOU ON ANYTHING.

24:42.649 --> 24:44.951
REALLY?
THEN WHY DID YOU COME IN?

24:44.984 --> 24:46.185
YOU COULD HAVE REFUSED TO
COOPERATE OVER A CELLPHONE.

24:46.218 --> 24:47.920
YOU HAVE ENOUGH OF THEM.

24:49.121 --> 24:50.557
NO, NO, NO.

24:50.590 --> 24:51.991
WE HAVE FAR TOO MANY
COMMON INTERESTS

24:52.024 --> 24:54.594
FOR YOU TO SAY
YOU CAN'T COOPERATE WITH ME.

24:54.627 --> 24:56.095
WHAT COMMON INTERESTS?

24:56.128 --> 24:58.998
THE MURDER OF CHARLIE NILES
AND HIS GRANDSON.

25:00.767 --> 25:02.168
THAT MURDER IS SOLVED, MA'AM.

25:02.201 --> 25:03.603
I MEAN, YOU KNOW WHO DID IT
AS WELL AS ME.

25:03.636 --> 25:05.872
WELL,
THE CASE IS CLOSED,

25:05.905 --> 25:07.874
JUST LIKE THE CASKETS
THAT YOU BOUGHT

25:07.907 --> 25:09.642
FOR THE NILES' FUNERALS
ARE CLOSED.

25:09.676 --> 25:10.910
AND THE DEAL THAT YOU MADE
FOR THE CONVENIENCE STORE

25:10.943 --> 25:14.213
THAT MR. NILES USED TO OWN
IS CLOSED.

25:14.246 --> 25:17.584
BUT AS WE ARE BOTH
WELL AWARE...

25:17.617 --> 25:20.319
"CLOSED"
DOES NOT MEAN "OVER."

25:20.352 --> 25:21.788
WELL, IT'S NOT OVER
FOR YOU, MAYBE,

25:21.821 --> 25:24.323
BUT, UM,
IT'S OVER FOR TURELL.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.659
HE MURDERED MR. NILES
AND HIS GRANDSON,

25:26.693 --> 25:29.596
AND NOW HE'S DEAD.

25:29.629 --> 25:31.664
WELL, THAT LEAVES US
WITH THE PROBLEM

25:31.698 --> 25:33.265
OF WHO MURDERED
TURELL BAYLOR.

25:33.299 --> 25:35.234
YEAH,
BUT WHO CARES ABOUT THAT?

25:35.267 --> 25:36.969
YOU?
COME ON.

25:37.003 --> 25:38.971
YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT THAT.

25:39.005 --> 25:41.574
AS IT TURNS OUT, MR. EVANS,
I HAVE TO CARE ABOUT THAT,

25:41.608 --> 25:43.710
IN MUCH THE SAME WAY
YOU HAVE TO CARE ABOUT IT.

25:43.743 --> 25:45.712
WE ALSO --
BOTH OF US --

25:45.745 --> 25:47.880
HAVE TO CARE ABOUT THE MURDER
OF A YOUNG MAN

25:47.914 --> 25:49.816
BY THE NAME
OF JAMES TURNER --

25:49.849 --> 25:52.218
J-ROCK TO HIS FRIENDS.

25:52.251 --> 25:55.154
WE HAVE NO IDEA WHO THIS...
J-ROCK IS.

25:55.187 --> 25:56.789
MAYBE YOU DON'T,
BUT MR. EVANS DOES.

26:01.193 --> 26:02.595
Man:
HELLO?
Reggie: HEY, DAWG.

26:02.629 --> 26:04.631
SAW MY NEW LAWYER TODAY.

26:04.664 --> 26:06.165
PETER GOLDMAN.

26:06.198 --> 26:08.635
GONNA FILE AN APPEAL
FOR ME.

26:08.668 --> 26:11.237
HE HAS FIVE INVESTIGATORS
RESEARCHING MY CASE.

26:11.270 --> 26:15.241
ONE OF THEM
TALKS TOO MUCH.

26:15.274 --> 26:16.609
THANKS, MAN.
STAY CHILL.

26:18.110 --> 26:20.613
THAT'S REGGIE MOSES
CALLING FROM SAN QUENTIN

26:20.647 --> 26:21.981
TO A DISPOSABLE
CELLPHONE...

26:22.014 --> 26:25.017
TO A GUY THAT SOUNDS
A LOT LIKE YOU.

26:25.051 --> 26:27.887
IT'S NOT ME.

26:27.920 --> 26:31.057
WE TRACED THAT CELL
TO A WAREHOUSE IN SEATTLE

26:31.090 --> 26:32.892
OWNED BY MYMA INDUSTRIES.

26:32.925 --> 26:35.628
THAT CONNECTS IT TO YOU, SIR.
AND REGGIE'S NEW LAWYER?

26:35.662 --> 26:37.764
MR. GOLDMAN?
HE WAS ALSO FRIENDS WITH J-ROCK.

26:37.797 --> 26:39.699
SO?

26:39.732 --> 26:41.868
SO, J-ROCK GAVE PETER GOLDMAN
THE NAMES

26:41.901 --> 26:44.671
OF EVERYONE INVOLVED IN
THE MURDER OF TURELL BAYLOR.

26:48.074 --> 26:51.077
REGGIE. THE CELLPHONE.
MR. BAYLOR. MR. NILES.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.812
YOU AND J-ROCK
HAD A LOT IN COMMON

26:52.845 --> 26:55.848
FOR TWO PEOPLE
WHO NEVER KNEW EACH OTHER.

27:01.120 --> 27:04.657
AT LEAST, THAT'S WHAT
MR. GOLDMAN IS IMPLYING.

27:04.691 --> 27:06.292
IS HE WRONG?

27:06.325 --> 27:08.160
DOES THE LITTLE LIST OF NAMES
J-ROCK GAVE GOLDMAN

27:08.194 --> 27:09.762
MEAN NOTHING TO YOU
AT ALL?

27:09.796 --> 27:11.330
OH, MY GOD.

27:11.363 --> 27:13.265
OR IS IT SOMETHING ON WHICH
THE TWO OF US MIGHT COOPERATE?

27:16.936 --> 27:20.239
I MEET A LOT OF PEOPLE
IN MY LINE OF WORK.

27:21.908 --> 27:24.210
I'LL SEARCH MY CONTACTS,
LOOK AT MY E-MAILS.

27:25.745 --> 27:27.646
ALWAYS WANT TO HELP
IF I CAN.

27:28.881 --> 27:30.316
TOMMY.

27:33.185 --> 27:36.155
YOU SHOULD HEAR FROM ME AGAIN,
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

27:36.188 --> 27:38.190
WONDERFUL.

27:40.026 --> 27:41.060
CHIEF JOHNSON.

27:41.093 --> 27:43.062
THANK YOU.

27:43.095 --> 27:46.098
WELL, THAT DIDN'T GO VERY WELL,
DID IT?

27:46.132 --> 27:49.836
THAT ALL DEPENDS ON
WHAT YOU THINK JUST HAPPENED.

28:01.513 --> 28:04.183
Goldman: THIS IS BEYOND
THE PALE, EVEN FOR YOU!

28:04.216 --> 28:06.385
Pope:
YOU NEED TO JUST CALM DOWN

28:06.418 --> 28:08.154
AND TELL US
WHAT HAS YOU SO UNNERVED.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.922
SHE JUST LAID ME OUT
TO MARVIN EVANS,

28:09.956 --> 28:13.392
WHO IS PROBABLY ARRANGING A HIT
ON ME RIGHT NOW.

28:13.425 --> 28:15.394
YOU KNOW WHO MARVIN EVANS IS?
HOW SURPRISING.

28:15.427 --> 28:18.064
YOU NEVER
MENTIONED HIM BEFORE.

28:18.097 --> 28:20.499
I LEARNED ABOUT MARVIN EVANS
FROM TURELL BAYLOR'S MOTHER,

28:20.532 --> 28:22.434
WHO I REPRESENT.
SHE'S THE ONE WHO TOLD ME

28:22.468 --> 28:25.972
HE PUT A CONTRACT OUT
ON TURELL'S LIFE.

28:26.005 --> 28:27.740
OH. SO MAYBE YOU DIDN'T MENTION
HIM TO US BEFORE

28:27.774 --> 28:29.275
BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
A MITIGATING FACTOR

28:29.308 --> 28:30.777
IN CHIEF JOHNSON'S FAVOR.

28:30.810 --> 28:34.180
IF MARVIN EVANS PAID
TO HAVE TURELL KILLED --

28:34.213 --> 28:36.883
IT...CHANGES...NOTHING.

28:36.916 --> 28:40.519
CHIEF JOHNSON STILL ARRANGED
THE CIRCUMSTANCES

28:40.552 --> 28:42.088
THAT LED TO THE --

28:46.358 --> 28:49.829
I AM NOT GOING TO ARGUE
THIS CASE HERE TODAY.

28:49.862 --> 28:52.331
THANKS TO YOU PEOPLE,

28:52.364 --> 28:54.100
MARVIN EVANS NOW KNOWS I HAVE
THE NAMES OF THE PEOPLE --

28:54.133 --> 28:55.935
YOUHAVE THE NAMES!

28:57.069 --> 28:58.504
YOU SAT THERE
IN MY INTERVIEW ROOM,

28:58.537 --> 29:00.840
KNOWING FULL WELL WHO KILLED
THAT WITNESS OF YOURS,

29:00.873 --> 29:02.374
AND YOU REFUSED
TO TELL ME!

29:02.408 --> 29:05.011
I NEVER ACTUALLY SAID
I DIDN'T POSSESS THE NAMES!

29:05.044 --> 29:07.914
I SAID I DIDN'T HAVE THEM,
WHICH IS TRUE!
I HAVE YOU ON RECORD --

29:07.947 --> 29:09.782
THEY WERE ON A LIST --
ON TAPE, DENYING THAT --

29:09.816 --> 29:13.185
YOU TAP A PRE-TRIAL CONFERENCE
WITHOUT MY PERMISSION?

29:13.219 --> 29:15.021
IT WAS NOT
A PRETRIAL CONFERENCE.

29:15.054 --> 29:16.288
IT WAS THE INTERVIEW

29:16.322 --> 29:17.957
OF A MATERIAL WITNESS
IN A MURDER CASE!

29:17.990 --> 29:20.259
I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU CALL IT!

29:20.292 --> 29:21.527
J-ROCK IDENTIFIED

29:21.560 --> 29:24.964
TURELL BAYLOR'S MURDERERS
TO YOU.

29:24.997 --> 29:27.366
SO LET ME TELL YOU
WHAT WILL HAPPEN NOW.

29:27.399 --> 29:30.769
YOU WILL GIVE US
THAT LIST OF NAMES.

29:32.338 --> 29:37.043
IF IT IS WRITTEN DOWN
AND ON YOUR PERSON,

29:37.076 --> 29:38.544
YOU WILL PUT IT IN MY HAND.

30:00.032 --> 30:04.971
SO MUCH FOR THE CONSCIENCE
OF THE JUSTICE SYSTEM.

30:07.606 --> 30:11.043
"RICKY-ROCK...

30:11.077 --> 30:12.211
"C-JAZZ...

30:12.244 --> 30:15.081
DELOIN, AND LIL BUGSY."

30:15.114 --> 30:17.216
Gabriel: SO, CHIEF,
LAST YEAR, AFTER TURELL DIED,

30:17.249 --> 30:20.052
C-JAZZ AND DELOIN WENT TO VEGAS
FOR THREE DAYS.

30:20.086 --> 30:22.621
HOTEL BILL -- $6,000.

30:22.654 --> 30:27.093
OKAY. RICKY-ROCK,
WHO'S J-ROCK'S BROTHER --

30:27.126 --> 30:28.961
SAYS A LOT
ABOUT THESE PEOPLE --

30:28.995 --> 30:30.529
BOUGHT HIS MOTHER
A BRAND-NEW CAR.

30:30.562 --> 30:32.865
AND LAST NIGHT, AFTER HIS
BROTHER WAS SHOT TO DEATH,

30:32.899 --> 30:34.000
BOOKED A TRIP
TO NEW YORK.

30:34.033 --> 30:35.334
SEVEN NIGHTS
AT THE LONDON, CHIEF.

30:35.367 --> 30:38.337
REGGIE MOSES HAD $10,000
PUT ON HIS BOOKS

30:38.370 --> 30:41.173
BY LIL BUGSY'S DAD,
A FORMER 110.

30:43.910 --> 30:46.045
Brenda: OKAY.

30:46.078 --> 30:47.880
UH, LIEUTENANT PROVENZA,
WOULD YOU PLEASE

30:47.914 --> 30:49.916
ORGANIZE THE TAKEDOWN
OF THESE BOYS?

30:53.185 --> 30:54.353
UH, OKAY.
UH, SURE.

30:54.386 --> 30:56.322
UH...

30:56.355 --> 30:57.523
OKAY. UM...

30:58.657 --> 31:00.559
UH...

31:00.592 --> 31:02.895
ALL OUR SUSPECTS
ARE OUT ON PAROLE.

31:02.929 --> 31:05.264
SHOCKING, I KNOW.

31:05.297 --> 31:06.498
SO WE DON'T NEED WARRANTS
TO SEARCH THEIR HOUSES.

31:06.532 --> 31:08.000
WE'LL PICK THEM UP
IN SEPARATE CARS.

31:08.034 --> 31:10.102
AND -- AND IF YOU CAN FIND
ANY REASONS

31:10.136 --> 31:12.538
TO ARREST THEIR PARENTS,
THEIR BROTHERS OR THEIR SISTERS,

31:12.571 --> 31:13.940
BRING THEM IN, TOO.

31:13.973 --> 31:15.574
IT'S TIME TO STOP PLAYING
PATTY-CAKE

31:15.607 --> 31:17.376
WITH THESE ASSHOLES.

31:25.017 --> 31:26.518
CHIEF.

31:28.054 --> 31:31.190
ARE YOU GOING
WHERE I THINK YOU'RE GOING?

31:31.223 --> 31:34.693
I NEED TO FINISH MY CONVERSATION
WITH MR. EVANS.

31:34.726 --> 31:37.329
WITHOUT BACK

31:37.363 --> 31:39.298
YOU JUST SENT OUT
YOUR ENTIRE SQUAD.

31:39.331 --> 31:42.034
THEY CAN'T KNOW.

31:46.272 --> 31:50.442
YOU'RE NOT GONNA TRY AND ARREST
MARVIN EVANS BY YOURSELF,

31:50.476 --> 31:52.211
ARE YOU?

31:52.244 --> 31:54.613
I'M NOT GONNA ARREST HIM
AT ALL, CAPTAIN.

31:56.748 --> 31:59.085
EXCUSE ME.

32:12.698 --> 32:15.001
MR. EVANS.

32:17.236 --> 32:18.737
SIT! SIT! SIT.

32:18.770 --> 32:21.540
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

32:21.573 --> 32:22.608
THEY PROBABLY
SMELL MY CAT.

32:22.641 --> 32:24.276
OR YOUR GUN.

32:24.310 --> 32:27.613
I-I WAS WONDERING IF I MIGHT
HAVE A MOMENT OF YOUR TIME.

32:31.417 --> 32:32.751
COME ON, BOYS.

32:32.784 --> 32:34.220
EASY.

32:45.431 --> 32:47.566
OH, MY.

32:49.301 --> 32:52.271
YOU'RE A LONG WAY
FROM HOME.

32:52.304 --> 32:55.674
NOT SO FAR.

32:55.707 --> 32:57.543
I CAN SEE MY HOUSE
FROM HERE.

32:59.078 --> 33:00.479
CAN I GET YOU SOMETHING TO DRINK
OR SOMETHING?

33:00.512 --> 33:02.114
NO. THANK YOU.

33:04.050 --> 33:05.051
IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL.

33:06.518 --> 33:08.620
DON'T GET EXCITED.

33:10.389 --> 33:13.159
I'M NOT GONNA HURT YOU.

33:13.192 --> 33:18.597
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU
TO HURT ME, EITHER.

33:18.630 --> 33:21.733
AND EVEN THOUGH YOU GAVE ME
THAT NICE WARNING TODAY,

33:21.767 --> 33:24.170
YOU COULD STILL BE
WEARING A WIRE.

33:24.203 --> 33:30.042
SO, YES, I AM A LONG, LONG WAY
FROM WHERE I GREW UP.

33:30.076 --> 33:32.211
BUT, UH...

33:32.244 --> 33:33.479
BUT THAT'S HOME.

33:33.512 --> 33:34.780
THIS PLACE?

33:34.813 --> 33:38.384
IT'S JUST AN INVESTMENT.

33:38.417 --> 33:40.052
I'M ALL BUSINESS NOW.

33:40.086 --> 33:43.422
DOPE IS OVER.

33:47.726 --> 33:51.130
YOU'RE NOT READING ME
MY RIGHTS, EITHER?

33:51.163 --> 33:52.764
NO.

33:52.798 --> 33:54.833
SO, WHAT,
ARE YOU AN IDIOT?

33:54.866 --> 33:57.569
OR DOES THAT ACCENT
JUST MAKE YOU SOUND LIKE ONE?

33:57.603 --> 33:59.238
GOING AFTER
THE KILLERS OF TURELL BAYLOR?

34:00.739 --> 34:02.674
YOU CATCH THOSE GUYS,
ONE OF THEM MIGHT ROLL.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.176
YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT.

34:04.210 --> 34:06.645
YOU'RE IN MORE TROUBLE
THAN I AM.

34:06.678 --> 34:10.549
THOSE BOYS DIDN'T KILL TURELL
OR J-ROCK WITHOUT PERMISSION,

34:10.582 --> 34:13.219
AND THAT DID NOT
COME FROM ME.

34:13.252 --> 34:15.187
J-ROCK WAS ABOUT TO EXPOSE YOU.
DO YOU KNOW THAT?

34:15.221 --> 34:17.289
YOU'RE TREATING HIM
LIKE A VICTIM,

34:17.323 --> 34:19.525
BUT J-ROCK WAS ABOUT TO MAKE
A VICTIM OUT OF YOU.

34:19.558 --> 34:20.659
I HAVE NO CHOICE.

34:20.692 --> 34:22.261
GOLDMAN BREATHING DOWN
MY NECK --

34:22.294 --> 34:24.263
IF I DON'T SERIOUSLY INVESTIGATE
J-ROCK'S MURDER,

34:24.296 --> 34:25.797
I COULD END UP
LOOKING EVEN WORSE.

34:25.831 --> 34:29.168
BESIDES, YOU DIDN'T OFF
J-ROCK FOR ME.

34:29.201 --> 34:30.636
HE WAS RATTING OUT
HIS FRIENDS,

34:30.669 --> 34:33.105
ANY OF WHOM COULD HAVE TURNED
ON YOU ANY MINUTE.

34:33.139 --> 34:34.640
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SAID
WE HAD COMMON INTERESTS.

34:34.673 --> 34:37.609
ONLY BECAUSE YOU ORDERED A HIT
ON TURELL BAYLOR.

34:37.643 --> 34:40.579
THAT'S WHEN ALL
MY TROUBLE STARTED.

34:40.612 --> 34:42.348
OH. SO, TELL ME.

34:42.381 --> 34:43.515
WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD HAVE
HAPPENED TO TURELL?

34:43.549 --> 34:45.851
HE SHOT CHARLIE NILES
TO DEATH

34:45.884 --> 34:49.255
AND HIS LITTLE GRANDSON
OVER A BEER.

34:49.288 --> 34:52.458
YOU WANTED HIM TO WALK?

34:52.491 --> 34:54.293
NOW, I KNOW
YOU DIDN'T WANT THAT

34:54.326 --> 34:55.794
BECAUSE OF HOW YOU
LET HIM GO.

34:55.827 --> 34:58.230
NAH. NAH.

34:58.264 --> 35:01.800
SEE, YOU KNEW TURELL HAD TO DIE
AS MUCH AS I DID.

35:01.833 --> 35:03.769
AND WHAT ABOUT
HIS TWIN BROTHER, TY

35:03.802 --> 35:06.138
HOME ON LEAVE
FROM AFGHANISTAN.

35:06.172 --> 35:10.476
SHOT TO DEATH IN A PARKING LOT
WITH TWO OTHER ARMY RANGERS

35:10.509 --> 35:11.710
JUST BECAUSE HE LOOKED
LIKE TURELL?

35:11.743 --> 35:13.812
TY AND HIS FRIENDS --

35:13.845 --> 35:15.281
DID TH DESERVE TO DIE

35:15.314 --> 35:16.515
BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED
TO CHARLIE NILES?

35:16.548 --> 35:18.317
DON'T TALK TO ME
ABOUT CHARLIE NILES.

35:18.350 --> 35:20.486
OKAY? YOU DON'T KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT CHARLIE NILES.

35:20.519 --> 35:22.388
I MEAN, IN A PLACE
WHERE YOU HAD TO STEAL

35:22.421 --> 35:23.722
TO PAY
FOR BABY'S DIAPERS...

35:23.755 --> 35:25.491
HE GAVE THEM AWAY.

35:25.524 --> 35:27.759
WHEN WE DIDN'T KNOW IF THERE WAS
GONNA BE FOOD ON THE TABLE

35:27.793 --> 35:30.662
IN THE MORNING,
THAT OLD MAN --

35:33.432 --> 35:37.569
THAT OLD MAN
HELPED US SURVIVE.

35:37.603 --> 35:40.706
AND NOT JUST ME, EITHER --

35:40.739 --> 35:45.711
BUT MY MOTHER, MY FRIENDS,
OUR NEIGHBORS.

35:45.744 --> 35:49.315
AND WHAT DID YOU PEOPLE DO
WHEN CHARLIE GOT SHOT DEAD?

35:51.417 --> 35:53.385
NOTHING.

35:54.586 --> 35:58.290
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED
AFTER THAT --

35:58.324 --> 36:01.427
J-ROCK, TY, THEM SOLDIERS --
EVERYTHING --

36:01.460 --> 36:03.795
IT HAPPENED BECAUSE YOU PEOPLE
DIDN'T GIVE A DAMN

36:03.829 --> 36:05.497
ABOUT CHARLIE NILES!

36:05.531 --> 36:08.667
AND I WONDER
IF CHARLIE WOULD BE PROUD

36:08.700 --> 36:13.605
OF HOW YOU PAID HIM BACK --
KILLING ALL THOSE PEOPLE.

36:13.639 --> 36:16.242
IS THAT WHAT CHARLIE
WOULD HAVE WANTED?

36:19.311 --> 36:22.714
I TOLD YOU --
DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT CHARLIE.

36:24.850 --> 36:26.918
NOW GET UP.

36:28.354 --> 36:29.821
GET UP.

36:32.858 --> 36:35.694
YOU'RE LEAVING.

36:35.727 --> 36:38.264
AND YOU ARE GOING TO
STAY OUT OF MY WAY

36:38.297 --> 36:41.300
WHILE I FINISH UP
OUR "COMMON INTERESTS."

36:41.333 --> 36:43.502
REGGIE'S IN PRISON
FOR THE MISTAKES HE'S MADE,

36:43.535 --> 36:46.538
TURELL AND J-ROCK ARE DEAD,
AND WHEN GOLDMAN IS GONE --

36:46.572 --> 36:50.542
AS YOU POINTED OUT,
IS NECESSARY FOR BOTH OF US --

36:50.576 --> 36:54.580
THEN OUR LITTLE PARTNERSHIP
WILL END.

37:00.018 --> 37:02.488
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
THANK ME LATER.

37:04.022 --> 37:07.025
JUST DON'T COME BACK.

37:07.058 --> 37:09.661
I WON'T.

37:09.695 --> 37:11.330
FBI!
AGAINST THE WALL!

37:21.840 --> 37:24.943
WELL, WE'VE MADE
ALL OUR ARRESTS,

37:24.976 --> 37:26.912
AND RICKY-ROCK IS A-TALKING.

37:26.945 --> 37:28.680
HE'S ALSO LEFT-HANDED,
CHIEF.

37:28.714 --> 37:30.582
RICKY-ROCK SHOT HIS OWN BROTHER
IN THE BACK?

37:30.616 --> 37:32.284
MM-HMM, IT'S PROBABLY WHY
HE WASN'T SURPRISED

37:32.318 --> 37:33.519
BY THE NOTIFICATION.

37:33.552 --> 37:35.053
Gabriel: YEAH,
WHEN THE BOYS FOUND OUT

37:35.086 --> 37:38.824
THAT THE FBI HAD ESTABLISHED
A WIRE IN MARVIN'S CONDO,

37:38.857 --> 37:40.626
IT WAS LIKE A COMPETITION

37:40.659 --> 37:41.760
TO SEE WHO COULD
GET THEIR STORY OUT

37:41.793 --> 37:42.661
BEFORE HE MADE
HIS OWN DEAL.

37:42.694 --> 37:44.663
WELL...

37:44.696 --> 37:46.565
NO ONE CAN SAY WE DIDN'T
FOLLOW UP ON TURELL BAYLOR,

37:46.598 --> 37:49.301
ALL THE WAY
TO THE BITTER END.

37:49.335 --> 37:50.636
WELL, NOT SO BITTER,

37:50.669 --> 37:52.471
THOUGH WE ARE AT THE END
OF THINGS, FINALLY.

37:52.504 --> 37:55.574
OKAY.
PARDON ME, GENTLEMEN.

37:59.578 --> 38:00.846
Pope: CHIEF JOHNSON,
THIS AGREEMENT

38:00.879 --> 38:04.450
IS REALLY BENEFICIAL
TO ALL PARTIES INVOLVED.

38:04.483 --> 38:07.886
I DON'T KNOW
THAT YOU EVEN NEED TO READ IT.

38:07.919 --> 38:09.488
OH, I THINK SHE DOES.

38:09.521 --> 38:11.056
Gavin: WELL,
SHE CAN IF SHE WANTS TO,

38:11.089 --> 38:12.791
BUT SHE'S BEEN DROPPED
FROM THE SUIT.

38:12.824 --> 38:14.360
I HAVE?

38:14.393 --> 38:16.395
YES, YOU HAVE.

38:16.428 --> 38:18.530
AND THE GOOD PEOPLE
OF LOS ANGELES

38:18.564 --> 38:20.632
WILL BE PAYING MR. GOLDMAN
A MILLION-DOLLAR ASSESSMENT.

38:20.666 --> 38:22.368
WHICH WON'T EVEN COVER
MY EXPENSES.

38:23.769 --> 38:25.437
OH, WHAT ABOUT CLEARING
MY NAME IN COURT?

38:25.471 --> 38:27.773
Pope: LOOK, LISTEN --

38:27.806 --> 38:30.542
I KNOW THIS IS MAYBE NOT
EVERYTHING YOU WERE HOPING FOR,

38:30.576 --> 38:33.011
BUT YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK
FOR ANY DAMAGES.

38:34.446 --> 38:35.681
WELL, I-I DON'T CARE

38:35.714 --> 38:37.583
WHAT THE CITY
OR THE DEPARTMENT DECIDES,

38:37.616 --> 38:39.385
I DON'T AGREE WITH THIS.

38:39.418 --> 38:41.920
WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHETHER YOU AGREE OR NOT, DEAR.

38:41.953 --> 38:45.457
YOU'RE NO LONGER BEING SUED,
SO WE CAN SETTLE WITHOUT YOU.

38:45.491 --> 38:47.859
AND IN RETURN, WE'RE AGREEING
NOT TO BRING CHARGES

38:47.893 --> 38:50.829
OF MISCONDUCT
AGAINST PETER HERE,

38:50.862 --> 38:52.731
OR WORKING TO HAVE
HIS LAW LICENSE REVOKED

38:52.764 --> 38:55.467
OR CAUSING HIM ANY NUMBER
OF THE 10,000

38:55.501 --> 38:57.969
PERFECTLY LEGAL PROBLEMS
I'D JUST LOVE TO THROW HIS WAY.

38:59.538 --> 39:00.839
"THE JOHNSON RULE"?

39:00.872 --> 39:03.375
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?!

39:03.409 --> 39:05.511
Goldman:
OH, DIDN'T THEY TELL YOU?

39:05.544 --> 39:08.013
TO SATISFY MY CONCERNS,
AND THOSE OF MY CLIENTS,

39:08.046 --> 39:10.649
AND TO MAKE SURE
THAT THEY DON'T RE-FILE

39:10.682 --> 39:12.518
USING OTHER
LEGAL REPRESENTATION,

39:12.551 --> 39:15.721
YOUR ATTORNEY
AND THE CHIEF OF POLICE --
ALL RIGHT, SHUT UP!

39:16.822 --> 39:19.825
THE JOHNSON RULE
IS ESSENTIALLY --

39:19.858 --> 39:23.762
IT'S A SILLY,
OBVIOUS SPECIAL ORDER

39:23.795 --> 39:25.464
THAT GOLDMAN WANTS
THAT SAYS

39:25.497 --> 39:30.001
THE L.A.P.D. CANNOT KNOWINGLY
RELEASE A SUSPECT OR WITNESS

39:30.035 --> 39:32.738
INTO A HOSTILE
OR DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENT.

39:32.771 --> 39:34.606
IT'S --
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

39:36.642 --> 39:39.511
HOW COULD YOU
LET THIS HAPPEN?

39:39.545 --> 39:40.912
PUTTING MY -- MY NAME
ON A SPECIAL ORDER LIKE THIS

39:40.946 --> 39:43.114
MAKES IT SOUND LIKE
I DID SOMETHING WRONG!

39:43.148 --> 39:45.751
I JUST SOLVED THE MURDER
THAT I WAS ACCUSED OF PLANNING.

39:45.784 --> 39:47.453
HOW COULD YOU
LET THIS HAPPEN?!

39:47.486 --> 39:48.754
I'M SORRY.

39:48.787 --> 39:50.489
I JUST SAVED YOU
FROM A CIVIL RIGHTS ACTION

39:50.522 --> 39:52.458
THAT COULD HAVE COST YOU
YOUR CAREER

39:52.491 --> 39:53.725
AND EVERYTHING YOU OWN.

39:53.759 --> 39:55.026
AND THIS IS
THE THANKS I GET?

39:55.060 --> 39:56.795
NO, NO, NO.
HERE'S THE THANKS YOU GET.

39:56.828 --> 39:58.129
YOU'RE FIRED!

39:58.163 --> 39:59.631
AND IF IT'S NO BIG DEAL,

39:59.665 --> 40:00.932
WHY NOT CALL IT
THE POPE RULE?

40:00.966 --> 40:02.634
OR -- OR --
OR THE RAYDOR RULE?

40:02.668 --> 40:04.636
IT'S DISGRACEFUL!

40:04.670 --> 40:06.171
YOU'RE SELLING ME OUT!

40:12.644 --> 40:14.012
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

40:14.045 --> 40:16.081
MY GOD.
THE INGRATITUDE.

40:16.114 --> 40:17.115
IT'S SHOCKING,
ISN'T IT?

40:17.148 --> 40:19.551
ALL RIGHT, YOU...

40:19.585 --> 40:22.420
SERIOUSLY, SHUT UP.

40:24.155 --> 40:25.724
Raydor: CHIEF...

40:25.757 --> 40:27.125
DON'T TALK TO ME
RIGHT NOW.

40:27.158 --> 40:29.595
I KNOW YOU WROTE "REFUSED"
ON THE SETTLEMENT.

40:29.628 --> 40:31.029
I KNOW
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT,

40:31.062 --> 40:33.532
BUT I JUST DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW.

40:33.565 --> 40:35.000
DON'T TALK, THEN.
LISTEN.

40:35.033 --> 40:37.202
I KNOW THIS DIDN'T END THE WAY
WE WANTED, BUT RIGHT NOW,

40:37.235 --> 40:39.971
CONSIDERING THE LIST OF SUSPECTS
HE GAVE US, THERE IS A CHANCE

40:40.005 --> 40:42.173
THAT PETER GOLDMAN
WILL BE IN DANGER

40:42.207 --> 40:43.642
THE MOMENT HE LEAVES
THIS BUILDING.

40:45.210 --> 40:46.778
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO ABOUT THAT?

40:51.116 --> 40:53.685
SO...

40:53.719 --> 40:57.656
ASK GOLDMAN TO REVEAL HIS LEAK
INSIDE OF MAJOR CRIMES NICELY.

40:57.689 --> 41:02.093
AND IF HE REFUSES,
WELL...

41:02.127 --> 41:04.963
ORDER HIM PROTECTION
WHETHER HE LIKES IT OR NOT.

41:04.996 --> 41:08.099
THAT IS THE RIGHT
AND HONORABLE THING TO DO.

41:08.133 --> 41:10.736
IT'S "THE JOHNSON RULE,"
CAPTAIN.

41:12.671 --> 41:15.006
THANK YOU.
