I'm even talking to.

31:22.047 --> 31:25.517
We work nights together for over

You're a liability.

31:35.936 --> 31:37.859
I can't follow
this back-and-forth anymore.

31:38.688 --> 31:40.986
You had one simple directive.

31:41.149 --> 31:43.823

until the plan was executed.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.621
It doesn't work that way.
There's no on/off switch.

31:46.696 --> 31:48.790
Then tell me,
how does it work?

31:49.157 --> 31:51.501
'Cause I don't even know which
Elliot I'm talking to right now.

31:51.576 --> 31:53.670
How it works is I am here now.

you to be a God.

32:03.171 --> 32:04.172

was and how inferior you are.

I had to knock him out,
and now we're here.

I was asking
about your phone call.

43:26.938 --> 43:28.030

He's gonna wake up again.

43:38.366 --> 43:40.539
He saw you and Tyrell.

43:41.035 --> 43:42.753
He only saw us
for a few seconds.

43:42.829 --> 43:44.206
Maybe he won't remember.

And, if he does,
I'll handle it.

Fight him Off.

44:18.781 --> 44:19.907

44:22.743 --> 44:24.916
