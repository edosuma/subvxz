WEBVTT

00:03.537 --> 00:06.638
No, Mom, I am not cold.

00:06.640 --> 00:09.041
Yeah, I-I am
wearing a sweater.

00:10.277 --> 00:12.811
I will take it off
if it gets hot.

00:12.813 --> 00:16.882
Yeah, Mom,
I<i> know</i> how sweaters work.

00:16.884 --> 00:19.218
Hey, honey.

00:20.354 --> 00:21.687
No, no, it's too early.

00:21.689 --> 00:22.654
(sighs)

00:22.656 --> 00:24.990
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

00:24.992 --> 00:26.458
Mm.

00:26.460 --> 00:29.762
You're right,
I won't,<i> Mom.</i>

00:33.367 --> 00:36.201
Uh, I got -- I got --
I got to go.

00:36.203 --> 00:37.536
Yeah, yeah.

00:37.538 --> 00:40.539
No, one of the girls
isn't wearing a sweater.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.474
(beep)

00:42.476 --> 00:44.209
(chuckles)

00:44.211 --> 00:46.078
My mom's dead.

00:46.080 --> 00:49.148
Yeah, your life
is perfect.

00:49.150 --> 00:52.017
So, how was your day?

00:52.019 --> 00:53.886
You don't want to know
about my day.

00:53.888 --> 00:55.988
You just want to rant on
about your mom.

00:55.990 --> 00:57.523
My mother is impossible.

00:57.525 --> 00:58.924
And we're off!

00:58.926 --> 01:00.559
She is always
telling me what to do

01:00.561 --> 01:02.094
like I'm still
10 years old.

01:02.096 --> 01:04.096
You like when people think
you're younger than you are.

01:05.199 --> 01:06.899
The guy at the liquor store
who carded you,

01:06.901 --> 01:08.534
you talked about that
for three weeks.

01:08.536 --> 01:10.936
And she goes on and on
about her friends

01:10.938 --> 01:14.373
who all apparently have the same
last name -- "Who's Dying."

01:14.375 --> 01:15.874
(chuckles)
Yeah, no, there's Carla,

01:15.876 --> 01:17.242
who's dying,

01:17.244 --> 01:20.179
Brenda, who's dying,
Mildred, who's dying.

01:20.181 --> 01:21.513
Who's Dying
is a big family.

01:21.515 --> 01:22.848
Mm.

01:22.850 --> 01:24.850
Mother-daughter relationships
are tough.

01:24.852 --> 01:26.452
Let's not forget
Lizzie Borden.

01:26.454 --> 01:29.888
Hey, hey.
We never heard Lizzie's side.

01:29.890 --> 01:31.757
No, I-I'm serious, Mike.

01:31.759 --> 01:34.026
It's like our relationship
never got past

01:34.028 --> 01:35.727
a mother-daughter
dynamic.

01:35.729 --> 01:38.964
Yeah, you know, it's horrible
when mothers act like m-mothers.

01:39.967 --> 01:42.134
Sorry. I'm just doing
the best I can here.

01:42.136 --> 01:43.602
Just once I grew up,

01:43.604 --> 01:45.571
we never transitioned
into just being friends.

01:45.573 --> 01:47.239
And that's on her.

01:47.241 --> 01:49.808
She never made any effort to do
the things I like to do.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.243
Why don't you just
talk to her?

01:51.245 --> 01:53.245
No, Mike, no, no,
because it's too late,

01:53.247 --> 01:55.581
and -- and the worst part is it
doesn't even seem to bother her.

01:55.583 --> 01:57.149
I mean, I would be devastated
if I ended up

01:57.151 --> 01:59.218
in a relationship like that
with my daughters.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.153
It's never gonna happen. You have a
great relationship with the girls.

02:01.155 --> 02:02.488
You really do.
You mean it?

02:02.490 --> 02:03.388
You're not just --
just saying that?

02:03.390 --> 02:05.624
Little bit of both.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.826
(sighs)
Just want to wrap this up.

02:07.828 --> 02:10.996
Honey, I-I mean,
it worries me sometimes.

02:10.998 --> 02:12.998
The girls are all
pretty grown up,

02:13.000 --> 02:15.267
and can't believe
that Eve's already 18.

02:15.269 --> 02:16.668
You're having
your girls' night out,

02:16.670 --> 02:17.970
Taco Tuesday tonight
with them.

02:17.972 --> 02:19.605
You know what, yeah.

02:19.607 --> 02:21.807
That -- that has always been
a mother-daughter dinner.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.610
I think I'm gonna make it
different tonight.

02:24.612 --> 02:26.178
-Good.
-Yeah, no, no, no.

02:26.180 --> 02:28.447
I am not just gonna go out
with my daughters.

02:28.449 --> 02:31.617
I am also gonna go out
with my friends.

02:31.619 --> 02:34.653
Sounds like
a lot of people.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.021
Don't pick up the check.

02:54.775 --> 02:58.177
Look who just gave Father Time
the finger.

03:00.114 --> 03:02.814
I wanted to wear something
that said friend, not mom.

03:02.816 --> 03:04.516
Well, you nailed it, honey.
Yeah.

03:04.518 --> 03:07.486
Also nailed "roadie
for the Allman Brothers."

03:07.488 --> 03:10.055
Seriously, is it too much?

03:10.057 --> 03:12.024
No, no, no. You want to be like
the other girls,

03:12.026 --> 03:13.725
then you go up and change,
little missy.

03:13.727 --> 03:15.561
Hey, I can wear
whatever I want.

03:15.563 --> 03:18.730
You are not the boss of me!

03:18.732 --> 03:20.132
Hi, Mom.

03:20.134 --> 03:22.134
Wow!
You look great.

03:22.136 --> 03:24.703
Are you sure I don't look like a
roadie for the Allman Brothers?

03:24.705 --> 03:26.271
The who?

03:27.841 --> 03:30.108
No, the Allman Brothers.

03:31.378 --> 03:32.878
Just go --
go get the girls.

03:32.880 --> 03:36.548
-All right, cool.
-Hey, Boyd, hi, sweetie. Mm!

03:36.550 --> 03:38.483
Looking forward to hanging out
with Grandpa tonight?

03:38.485 --> 03:41.386
Yeah. I'm gonna ask him
if I can get a tattoo.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.522
Oh. I don't think
that's a good idea.

03:43.524 --> 03:44.856
Why would you want that?

03:44.858 --> 03:46.825
Well, my mom and Aunt Mandy
and Aunt Eve

03:46.827 --> 03:48.660
were talking about how great
it'd be.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.195
And also that
it was a secret

03:50.197 --> 03:52.130
[Whispering] and I shouldn't
tell anybody.

03:53.601 --> 03:54.967
Good job!

03:56.904 --> 03:58.270
Uh, Boyd, honey, you know,

03:58.272 --> 04:00.072
it's, uh, it's okay
that you told me.

04:00.074 --> 04:02.074
I mean, I-I think tattoos
are cool, too.

04:02.076 --> 04:04.276
But you're a grandma.

04:04.278 --> 04:06.979
Hey, I said I think
they're cool!

04:09.416 --> 04:13.352
Listen, listen, you should not
say anything to Grandpa, okay?

04:13.354 --> 04:14.686
Because even though
your mom

04:14.688 --> 04:16.221
and her sisters
are getting older,

04:16.223 --> 04:17.689
he'll always be the dad.

04:17.691 --> 04:20.592
Oh, so he makes tofu
and mung beans for breakfast?

04:20.594 --> 04:25.097
No, sweetie.
That's -- that's just your dad.

04:25.099 --> 04:27.299
You're so lucky
'cause you can be saying,

04:27.301 --> 04:30.869
"Oh, Ryan," and just be thinking
"Gosling, Gosling, Gosling."

04:30.871 --> 04:32.371
Or if you get tired of him,

04:32.373 --> 04:34.573
you can just shift
right on over to Reynolds.

04:34.575 --> 04:35.641
True.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.276
What are they
talking about?

04:37.278 --> 04:39.745
-Nothing. -Nothing! -Nothing.

04:39.747 --> 04:41.113
Then why are you laughing?

04:41.115 --> 04:42.714
-Uh --
-Oh, whoa, whoa, wait.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.650
Never ask women
why they're laughing.

04:44.652 --> 04:46.485
It's better than crying
or yelling.

04:46.487 --> 04:47.953
-Come on, Mom, hey. Let's go.
-Yeah.

04:47.955 --> 04:50.822
Let's get this
girls' night started.

04:50.824 --> 04:52.224
Don't wait up for me.
Okay.

04:52.226 --> 04:53.458
-Good night, baby.
-Love you.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.459
All right, have fun.
Drive safe.

04:54.461 --> 04:55.661
Love you!

04:55.663 --> 04:56.928
All right, let's go.
(door closes)

04:56.930 --> 04:58.463
What do girls do
on girls' night?

04:58.465 --> 05:01.433
Uh, they spend most of the time
trying to parallel park,

05:01.435 --> 05:03.502
put on hats,
and they giggle at them.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.570
What do we do
on guys' night?

05:05.572 --> 05:06.938
We're making hot dogs.

05:06.940 --> 05:09.141
My dad says that hot dogs
are poison.

05:09.143 --> 05:11.777
They are.

05:11.779 --> 05:14.913
But it turns out that mustard
is the antidote.

05:16.617 --> 05:19.651

05:19.653 --> 05:21.787
-Hey, Mr. Alzate.
-Hey, Kyle.

05:21.789 --> 05:24.122
Looks like there's another
exotic bird show

05:24.124 --> 05:26.158
Wendi's gonna try to drag
my ass to.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.293
That's fantastic.

05:28.295 --> 05:33.965
Tell me, what part of "drag
my ass" sounds fantastic?

05:33.967 --> 05:37.436
Oh, I-I stopped listening
after "exotic bird show."

05:37.438 --> 05:40.138
Oh. Sometimes I only
hear the good part.

05:40.140 --> 05:42.474
It really got me in trouble
the time my brother said,

05:42.476 --> 05:44.042
"Let's take
a motorcycle ride..."

05:44.044 --> 05:45.177
Hmm.

05:45.179 --> 05:46.545
"...to rob
a liquor store."

05:48.649 --> 05:49.881
Wendi loves birds.

05:49.883 --> 05:52.150
If she finds out
about this show,

05:52.152 --> 05:54.152
it could lead
to a big fight.

05:54.154 --> 05:55.987
Hey, Ed. Kyle.

05:55.989 --> 05:58.223
Hey, Ryan.
What are you doing here?

05:58.225 --> 05:59.725
Kristin's off
for the night.

05:59.727 --> 06:02.461
Uh, actually,
I came to talk to you guys.

06:02.463 --> 06:04.396
I want to learn
how to camp.

06:04.398 --> 06:07.299
You don't know how to camp?
Didn't your dad ever take you?

06:07.301 --> 06:10.068
A couple times he told my mom
he was taking me camping,

06:10.070 --> 06:12.838
and then we'd go to the casino
and I'd wait in the car.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.506
One time he actually
lost the car

06:14.508 --> 06:16.375
and we had to sleep
at the bus station,

06:16.377 --> 06:18.276
so I guess he kind of
took me camping.

06:19.480 --> 06:22.514
Man, your dad sounds cool.

06:22.516 --> 06:25.851
Wait, I don't think I heard
all of that.

06:25.853 --> 06:28.420
So, why the big push
to learn now?

06:28.422 --> 06:30.889
Well, Kris grew up camping,
and it's important to her.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.158
When we do go, I want to be able
to hold my own.

06:33.160 --> 06:36.928
Hmm. Well,
we've got weekly seminars.

06:36.930 --> 06:39.865
But you're part of
the Outdoor Man family,

06:39.867 --> 06:42.934
so you're gonna get
private lessons from Kyle.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.870
Oh, man,
you're gonna love it.

06:44.872 --> 06:48.340
Outdoor camping is not nearly as
dirty as bus station camping.

06:48.342 --> 06:50.342
This stuff looks
pretty hardcore.

06:50.344 --> 06:52.844
I hope I'll be able to
learn how to use it.

06:52.846 --> 06:56.181
Don't worry.
Kyle's an expert, so...

07:02.956 --> 07:05.924
So, then Eve runs over
and tackles the kid.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.359
He stole your hat.

07:07.361 --> 07:08.860
Dude, we were
in third grade.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.729
That's what boys do
when they like you.

07:10.731 --> 07:12.264
In my experience,
boys will do

07:12.266 --> 07:14.399
all sorts of stupid stuff
just to get your attention.

07:14.401 --> 07:16.234
-Mm.
-Tell me about it.

funnier if you'd been drinking.

Oh, wow,
it's 10:00 already?

07:27.414 --> 07:29.147
(chuckles) This evening's going
way too fast.

07:29.149 --> 07:30.749
Yeah. I wish I didn't have
school tomorrow.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.284
I'll write you a note.

07:32.286 --> 07:33.952
Remember when Kristin
used to do that for us?

07:33.954 --> 07:36.388
No, 'cause I never did.

07:36.390 --> 07:37.923
Please, please.

better than I do.

In fact, sign this.

07:41.728 --> 07:43.395
This feels so much more fun
than usual.

07:43.397 --> 07:44.996
I mean, I'm always
super entertaining,

07:44.998 --> 07:46.832
so one of you must've
stepped up your game.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.066
I think it's probably Mom.

07:48.068 --> 07:49.634
She hasn't once
licked her thumb

07:49.636 --> 07:51.403
and wiped something
off of our faces.

-No, no, no.

08:48.328 --> 08:50.562
Well, we were having
a great time,

I thought was a lovely dinner,

am to our daughters.

Damn those kids to hell.

little suggestion

09:06.880 --> 09:09.581
of something we could do
at the end of dinner,

09:09.583 --> 09:11.082

All right, well,
what was your little suggestion?

09:13.387 --> 09:15.053

a tattoo.

09:16.056 --> 09:19.224

kiss a sailor.

Boyd said the girls
wanted to get one.

to do it with me.

to be in their little club.

you had a great night,

09:33.273 --> 09:35.073

on one tiny little thing

09:35.075 --> 09:36.508
that didn't go your way.

09:36.510 --> 09:38.243
You're being a real
Mrs. Lincoln right now.

09:40.047 --> 09:42.180
All right, you know what, you --
you -- you don't understand.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.348
No, I don't understand.

09:43.350 --> 09:44.950
If you want a tattoo,
get a tattoo.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.918
Oh, 'cause it's --
it's more than that, Mike.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.254
I mean, God, you give so much
of your life to your kids.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.256
You give birth to them,
you raise them,

09:51.258 --> 09:53.858
you listen to all their stupid
little problems and --

09:53.860 --> 09:55.961
and then -- and then they get
to adulthood

09:55.963 --> 09:58.797
and it's, "Hey, hey, thanks
for the miracle of life,

09:58.799 --> 10:01.766
but I don't want
a tattoo."

10:01.768 --> 10:04.202
Wait a minute.
Hold that thought.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.370
What --
what are you doing?

10:05.372 --> 10:06.905
Taking notes.

10:06.907 --> 10:09.407
That could be a great hook
for my vlog on Mother's Day.

10:09.409 --> 10:12.877
Guilty kids are known
to buy mom a canoe.

10:14.915 --> 10:17.582
You're gonna use what I'm going

10:17.584 --> 10:19.618
You're not using it.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.252
Well, I might.

10:21.254 --> 10:23.989
I'm sorry your evening didn't
go well with your daughters.

10:23.991 --> 10:25.590
I'm gonna go to bed.

the<i> least</i> scary part of camping.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.374
Sorry, I...I get
a little claustrophobic.

11:16.376 --> 11:19.678
Ryan, so far you've poked
yourself in the eye

11:19.680 --> 11:23.048
with a tent pole, you've dropped
an axe on your toe,

11:23.050 --> 11:26.718
and somehow managed to get
your thumb stuck in a canteen.

11:26.720 --> 11:29.788
I'm just new to all this stuff,
you know?

11:29.790 --> 11:32.824
Now you're holding a can of gas
over a fire.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.893
Can you tell me why
that's a no-no?

11:34.895 --> 11:37.629
Because it would explode
into a fireball.

11:37.631 --> 11:38.963
Yes.

11:38.965 --> 11:41.132
Which you don't want to happen
in the woods.

11:41.134 --> 11:42.967
Mainly because
they're made of wood.

11:42.969 --> 11:44.803
You're right.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.137
I don't know what
I was thinking.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.039
I'm clearly
not meant for this.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.542
So, are you acclimating
to the great outdoors?

11:50.544 --> 11:52.711
No.
No, I am not.

11:52.713 --> 11:56.014
I love the environment,
but from afar.

11:56.016 --> 11:58.650
Sorry to hear that.
Camping's not for everyone.

11:58.652 --> 12:01.319
Especially teenagers
in horror movies.

12:01.321 --> 12:04.389
They always think their friends
are playing a joke on them,

12:04.391 --> 12:05.490
but they never are.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.525
"Stop it, Craig.

It's frustrating,
you know,

12:17.104 --> 12:18.203

for Kristin.

12:18.205 --> 12:19.604
Well, I know what it's like

12:19.606 --> 12:21.740
when your wife's harping
on you to do something,

12:21.742 --> 12:24.109
but you can't give in if it's
gonna make you miserable.

12:24.111 --> 12:26.945
No, she's not harping me.
We haven't even talked about it.

12:26.947 --> 12:29.614
I just knew she'd like it
and I wanted to surprise her.

12:29.616 --> 12:32.217
So, you came up with this
camping thing all by yourself?

12:32.219 --> 12:33.685
Yep.
Thought it'd make her happy.

12:33.687 --> 12:35.086
Hmm.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.621
And apparently make me
look like an idiot

12:36.623 --> 12:37.956
and maybe burn down
the woods.

12:39.392 --> 12:40.892

No.

to take her, huh?

12:48.101 --> 12:49.701
No.

12:49.703 --> 12:51.770
So, why the hell would he put
himself through all this?

12:51.772 --> 12:54.038
I guess he loves his wife.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.875
I'm sure he does.

13:14.427 --> 13:15.927
Mother's Day is coming up,

13:15.929 --> 13:18.329
so, kids, be sure to mark
your calendars.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.632
And then forget
until the last second,

13:20.634 --> 13:23.301
run out and buy a card

Every time you get sick,
we get sick.

13:28.642 --> 13:30.608
Except nobody makes<i> us</i> soup.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.811
One of the hardest parts
of being a mom

13:32.813 --> 13:35.613
is watching your kids grow up
and stop needing you.

13:35.615 --> 13:38.416
Well, let's face it.
Adults don't need mothers.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.919
They already know
how to use a sweater!

13:42.088 --> 13:43.688
So, is it possible for moms

13:43.690 --> 13:45.990
to have a strong relationship
with grown children?

13:45.992 --> 13:49.627
Yeah, I think it is.
Consider the orca.

13:49.629 --> 13:51.963
It's one of nature's
most beautiful creatures.

13:51.965 --> 13:54.499
An orca lives its whole life
at its mother's side,

13:54.501 --> 13:56.668
and they don't have any problem
with that.

13:56.670 --> 13:59.470
No orca has ever been excluded
from shark hunting

13:59.472 --> 14:01.206
because her daughter said,

14:01.208 --> 14:04.209
"It's not really the kind of
thing you do with your mom."

14:04.211 --> 14:06.878
Well, how can humans
stay that close?

14:06.880 --> 14:10.548
The best way is to make sure
your relationship evolves.

18:43.590 --> 18:45.123
Tell me what?

18:45.125 --> 18:46.958
Mom, we didn't want to get
tattoos with you that night

18:46.960 --> 18:50.294
because...well, we --
we kind of already got them.

18:50.296 --> 18:51.729
(vocalizes)

18:51.731 --> 18:53.831
See?
They're your initials.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.601
Although my "B"
kind of looks like a "D."

18:56.603 --> 18:58.803
The guy kept
looking into my eyes.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.671
The first time I had to be like,
"Hey, hey, hey!

19:00.673 --> 19:02.473
Eyes down there."

19:02.475 --> 19:06.277
I wanted to get an eagle
with a machine gun,

19:06.279 --> 19:08.846
but I was out-voted.

19:08.848 --> 19:11.849
Anyway...
-You guys got<i> my</i> initials?

19:11.851 --> 19:13.584
It was supposed to be
your Mother's Day gift.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.119
We didn't want to get
tattoos with you

19:15.121 --> 19:16.854
because we were just afraid
that you would see these.

19:16.856 --> 19:19.790
Yeah, we're totally down
to hang out with you, Mom.

19:19.792 --> 19:22.193
You'll always be the whale
swimming beside us.

19:22.195 --> 19:25.296
Yeah,
she means we love you.

19:25.298 --> 19:28.332
And now we can think about you
every time we put on socks.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.967
Come here.
Come here.

19:29.969 --> 19:31.335
I'm out of hugging range.
Score.

19:31.337 --> 19:33.838
No, come on.
Over here. Come here.

19:33.840 --> 19:34.939
(chuckles)

19:34.941 --> 19:38.342
This is the best gift ever.

19:38.344 --> 19:40.478
I love you girls
so, so much.

19:40.480 --> 19:43.848
Oh, and there actually was
another part to it.

19:43.850 --> 19:47.151
A gift certificate so that you
can get a matching tattoo

19:47.153 --> 19:48.452
with<i> our</i> initials,

19:48.454 --> 19:50.188
though I'm guessing
you might not

19:50.190 --> 19:51.656
want to
go back there now.

19:51.658 --> 19:54.492
Or we could just do it here
prison style.

19:54.494 --> 19:55.893
Razor and a Bic pen.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.995
I am going because

19:57.997 --> 20:01.332
that is the kind of thing you do
with your friends.

20:01.334 --> 20:02.667
Honey.
-What?

20:02.669 --> 20:03.701
Guess what.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.237
The girls all got tattoos.

20:06.239 --> 20:07.138
Ha ha.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.042
Well, that's it.

20:11.044 --> 20:12.610
I don't want them hanging out
with you anymore.

20:19.419 --> 20:21.352
Hey, Mike Baxter here
for Outdoor Man.

20:21.354 --> 20:24.222
What's more painful than not
feeling needed by your children?

20:24.224 --> 20:25.690
Well, getting a tattoo

20:25.692 --> 20:27.425
and still not feeling needed
by your children.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.694
Making a choice you'll
have to live with

20:29.696 --> 20:31.329
for the rest of your life

20:31.331 --> 20:34.165
should involve a lot more
thought and very little tequila.

20:34.167 --> 20:35.733
Covering your back
with a portrait

20:35.735 --> 20:37.435
of President Marco Rubio

20:37.437 --> 20:39.837
is probably something you'll
regret a year from now.

20:41.708 --> 20:45.476
When you're in one of
Donald Trump's internment camps.

20:47.614 --> 20:49.213
Probably safer to get a tattoo

20:49.215 --> 20:51.282
in honor of someone
you'll always love

20:51.284 --> 20:52.717
like your mom or your kids.

20:52.719 --> 20:54.085
Still, it's kind of weird

20:54.087 --> 20:56.120
to deface your body
to show you care.

20:56.122 --> 20:58.522
It's -- it's like,
"I love you so much,

20:58.524 --> 21:00.291
I'm gonna go key my own car."

21:02.895 --> 21:05.396
So, before you engrave something
on your skin,

21:05.398 --> 21:08.366
imagine yourself looking at it
in the mirror in 20 years.

21:08.368 --> 21:10.701
Or two.

21:10.703 --> 21:14.171
Or just after
the tequila wears off.

21:17.477 --> 21:19.277
And cut!

21:19.279 --> 21:21.112
(cheers and applause)

21:23.449 --> 21:25.149
Guy's a genius.

21:25.151 --> 21:29.053
Very good!
You're very good!
