the lenses for you.

really hard to make Nasty Goats,

12:48.700 --> 12:51.067

to steal our game,

12:51.067 --> 12:54.533

to other people.

you're a little too young

13:22.567 --> 13:24.900
to go on a date
with your weather lady?

13:24.900 --> 13:27.433
- It doesn't have to be
like an official date.

13:27.433 --> 13:32.100
I just wanna share some
macaroni and cheese with her.
