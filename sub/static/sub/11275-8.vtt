                CARLA:          
                Woody, here's   
                your dinner.    

00:07.139 --> 00:09.074
    Oh, thanks, Carla.          

00:09.108 --> 00:12.443
Boy, I'm going to be glad       
when I drop this double load.   

00:14.379 --> 00:16.314
My veins are killing me.        

00:16.347 --> 00:17.649
                Your veins, huh?

00:17.683 --> 00:19.417
Yeah, varicose veins.           

00:19.451 --> 00:22.353
I had them stripped             
twice already.                  

00:22.387 --> 00:23.538
            How do they do that?

00:23.572 --> 00:24.639
Surgically.                     

00:24.673 --> 00:25.874
They cut a hole                 

00:25.908 --> 00:30.344
in your leg,                    
and they pull the vein out.     

00:30.379 --> 00:31.646
                     No kidding?

00:31.680 --> 00:36.083
Yeah, it's like pulling         
a long, slimy worm              

00:36.118 --> 00:37.952
out of you flesh.               

00:37.987 --> 00:40.822
              Gee, imagine that.

00:40.856 --> 00:43.508
  Can you believe maintaining   
that postcoital tristesse       

00:43.543 --> 00:45.109
      is gender oriented.       

00:45.144 --> 00:46.845
         Do you mind, Dr. Crane?

00:46.879 --> 00:48.279

         Woody, does it look    
         like we're going to get

02:05.807 --> 02:07.475
                a good turnout  
                for our auction?

02:07.509 --> 02:08.642
Oh, yeah.                       

02:08.676 --> 02:10.511
I'll bet by now                 
there isn't anyone in Boston

who doesn't know about it.      

02:11.813 --> 02:13.315
                What auction?   
We're having an auction?        

02:15.534 --> 02:17.685
         It's terrific.         

02:17.719 --> 02:19.387
It's a benefit                  
for Children's Hospital.        

02:19.421 --> 02:20.855
All these women                 
get together                    

02:20.889 --> 02:22.890
          and they bid          
for an evening on the town      

02:22.924 --> 02:24.225
    with eligible bachelors.    

02:24.260 --> 02:26.361
Local celebrities,              
athletes.                       

02:26.395 --> 02:27.995
They raise a lot of money,      
     they do it every year,     

02:28.030 --> 02:29.197
 and it's a great deal of fun.  

02:29.231 --> 02:30.365
Where'd you hear about it?      

02:30.399 --> 02:32.900
 I must have been to one once.  

02:32.934 --> 02:34.369
Anyway,                         
I told Mr. Drake...             

02:34.403 --> 02:35.102
Who'd you bid on?               

02:36.188 --> 02:37.322
        I told Mr. Drake        

02:37.356 --> 02:39.024
        I thought               
  it would be great publicity   

02:39.058 --> 02:40.358
for Cheers.                     
        Who'd you bid on?       

02:40.393 --> 02:43.194
And since it's for a good cause,
          he agreed...          

02:43.229 --> 02:44.029
Who'd you bid on?               

02:44.063 --> 02:45.196
      A hairy linebacker.       

02:45.231 --> 02:46.331
    Are you satisfied?          

02:46.365 --> 02:47.698
    Ooh.                        
            Oh!                 

02:47.733 --> 02:49.634
        Were you?               

02:49.668 --> 02:50.335
          ( <i>laughing</i> )          

02:50.369 --> 02:51.652
         The point is,          

02:51.686 --> 02:54.955
        Mr. Drake               
thinks it's a great idea.       

02:54.990 --> 02:56.824
Woody...                        

02:56.858 --> 02:59.494
So, Sammy, you going to be      
  taking part in this auction?  

02:59.528 --> 03:00.828
      Are you kidding me?       

03:00.862 --> 03:02.196
    I hate that stuff.          

03:03.198 --> 03:04.048
         It's one thing         

03:04.083 --> 03:05.800
            for guys            
    to bid on chicks, but...    

03:05.834 --> 03:07.602
          that's sick.          

03:09.805 --> 03:11.872
You know, as a matter of fact...

03:11.907 --> 03:12.940
          Here you go.          

03:12.974 --> 03:14.108
                Excuse me.      

03:14.142 --> 03:16.344
    Listen, I'm going to save   
    you the embarrassment       

03:16.378 --> 03:18.112
              of asking and then
              being turned down.

03:18.146 --> 03:19.980
             I'm not going to be
             doing your auction.

03:20.015 --> 03:21.749
                  So just forget
                  it. No way.   

03:21.783 --> 03:22.883
                         Not me.

03:22.918 --> 03:24.085
    Fine.                       

03:24.119 --> 03:26.120
We need to create               
a stage.                        

03:26.154 --> 03:27.322
I think right there             

03:27.356 --> 03:28.556
as you walk in the door...      

03:28.591 --> 03:30.225
              Hey, what's "fine"
              supposed to mean? 

03:30.259 --> 03:33.160
Well, it means I hadn't planned 
to ask you in the first place.  

03:33.195 --> 03:34.362
        Oh, well, good, good.   

03:34.396 --> 03:36.797
        'Cause I really don't   
        care for that stuff.    

03:36.832 --> 03:37.798
    All right.                  

03:37.833 --> 03:39.634
We need a podium.               

03:39.668 --> 03:40.768
Because the emcee               
is going to be                  

03:40.802 --> 03:41.836
    standing at the podium,     

03:41.870 --> 03:43.170
    and all the women           
will be standing around...      

03:43.205 --> 03:44.472
                 Excuse me, one 
                 more time here.

03:44.506 --> 03:45.473
                        Why...  

03:45.507 --> 03:47.808
          why hadn't you planned
          on asking me?         

03:47.843 --> 03:49.510
         Well, I guess          
     I just don't find you      

03:49.545 --> 03:51.512
  as irresistible as some do.   

03:51.547 --> 03:54.014
    You, for instance.          

03:54.049 --> 03:57.017
But if you want to participate, 
you're perfectly welcome...     

03:57.052 --> 03:58.519
             No, hey, forget it.

03:58.554 --> 03:59.621
                      I'm sorry.

03:59.655 --> 04:01.389
    It doesn't matter to me     
          either way.           

04:01.423 --> 04:03.825
      I'm only doing this       
          for charity.          

04:03.859 --> 04:07.094
        You know, Vera has that 
        carved on our headboard.

04:09.498 --> 04:10.998
  So we're agreed then, right?  

04:11.033 --> 04:12.967
             Just plain simple  
             gold wedding bands.

04:13.001 --> 04:15.136
With an exquisite               
marquise diamond on mine        

04:15.170 --> 04:16.471
so we can                       
tell them apart.                

04:16.505 --> 04:17.805
          You give me such glee.

04:17.839 --> 04:18.973
                    Here we are.

04:19.007 --> 04:20.308
         Sit here, my betrothed.

04:20.341 --> 04:21.810
             I'll go get us     
             something to drink,

04:21.844 --> 04:24.278
        and, oh, uh, exchange   
        a few lies with my buds.

04:24.313 --> 04:25.346
I understand.                   

04:25.380 --> 04:27.081
Your daily dose                 
of male bonding.                

04:27.115 --> 04:28.583
                Well, not for   
                much longer.    

04:28.617 --> 04:31.319
    You know what's are breaking
    up that old gang of mine.   

04:31.353 --> 04:34.755
      As a guess, I'd say       
  hypertension and cirrhosis.   

04:37.143 --> 04:39.310
     You're irrepressible.      

04:41.613 --> 04:44.215
    Sam, champagne, please.     

04:44.249 --> 04:46.051
    Ah, guys.                   

04:46.085 --> 04:48.153
    Norm, Cliff.                

04:48.187 --> 04:50.121
    Won't be long now           
before the boys of the bar      

04:50.156 --> 04:51.923
  are going to have to manage   
          without me.           

04:51.957 --> 04:53.324
Can do.                         

04:53.358 --> 04:55.126
        Yeah, no sweat, Fras.   

04:58.097 --> 05:00.298
                 Champagne, huh?

05:00.332 --> 05:02.466
Well, wild romance              
is a fictive term               

05:02.501 --> 05:03.634
with no correlation             

05:03.669 --> 05:05.870
to any actual                   
physiological behavior.         

05:05.905 --> 05:08.306
We, nevertheless,               
like to humor convention        

05:08.340 --> 05:11.342
by going through                
with these preposterous rituals.

05:13.345 --> 05:15.880
                 Champagne, huh?

05:17.549 --> 05:20.484
Hey, Frasier,                   
can I ask you something?        

05:20.519 --> 05:22.270
When you and Lilith             
wake up in the morning,         

05:22.304 --> 05:23.971
which one of you                
is the first to scream,         

05:24.006 --> 05:25.440
"What have I done?"             

05:30.929 --> 05:32.830
            Well, my darling,   

05:32.864 --> 05:33.631
                    to us.      

05:33.665 --> 05:35.182
Thank you, darling.             

05:37.252 --> 05:39.153
It's been a lovely evening.     

05:39.187 --> 05:42.323
You've revealed                 
previously unsuspected depths   

05:42.358 --> 05:43.591
of romanticism.                 

05:43.625 --> 05:44.992
        Well, Lilith, we have   
        a whole lifetime        

05:45.026 --> 05:46.327
            of romantic evenings
            ahead of us,        

05:46.362 --> 05:47.495
              but for now,      
              we've got to plan.

05:47.529 --> 05:48.730
        We don't have much time.

05:48.764 --> 05:50.598
            We've got to get    
            the wedding license,

05:50.632 --> 05:52.233
            have blood tests,   
            see the lawyer      

05:52.267 --> 05:53.901
        draw up the             
        prenuptial agreement,   

05:53.935 --> 05:55.169
            invite the guests...

05:55.203 --> 05:56.237
        Excuse me.              

05:57.773 --> 06:00.207
What prenuptial agreement?      

06:00.242 --> 06:03.277
  Well, wherein we decide what  
 you are or are not entitled to 

06:03.312 --> 06:04.611
     in event of a divorce.     

06:04.646 --> 06:05.746
    It's merely a safeguard.    

06:05.780 --> 06:07.999
         You're already         
planning for the divorce?       

06:08.033 --> 06:11.652
    Have you selected           
     my cemetery plot also?     

06:11.686 --> 06:12.620
Well, assuming we stay together,

06:12.655 --> 06:15.222
you'll be right between me      
    and Cousin Lemuel.          

06:15.257 --> 06:17.291
I cannot believe my ears.       

06:17.325 --> 06:19.744
 This is your idea of romance?  

06:19.778 --> 06:21.962
Lilith, man does not live       
    by romance alone.           

06:21.997 --> 06:23.931
    He also needs hardheaded    
         practicality.          

06:23.965 --> 06:27.034
  If your head was any harder,  
      it would etch glass.

            Where are you going?

06:29.171 --> 06:30.304
I have no intention             

06:30.338 --> 06:31.606
of spending the rest            
of the evening,

the rest of my life,            

06:33.559 --> 06:36.510
with a compulsive,              
anal retentive, chowderhead.    

06:36.545 --> 06:38.630
          Now, Lilith,          

06:38.664 --> 06:40.498
  let's just both stop right now

06:40.532 --> 06:43.117
    before we say something     
    to spoil the mood.          

06:43.151 --> 06:46.421
        Why don't you go        
 make love to your accountant.  

06:47.989 --> 06:49.990
    You know, if more people    
     followed that advice,      

06:50.025 --> 06:52.794
      this world would be       
     such a happier place.

what you're doing here.

             reverse psychology.

06:58.851 --> 07:01.486
    You really want me to be    
    in that auction of yours,

            that you don't,

                     am I right?

                    Yeah, right.

07:11.663 --> 07:14.431
I have never felt               
more honestly and passionately  

07:14.466 --> 07:16.934
indifferent                     
about anything in my life.

I really don't care.

  They can talk all they like

is just pure animal lust.

        me with a vengeance?

          her how great you are,

            and then pow, you

              Oh, of course not.

22:27.828 --> 22:29.313
                  That was only 
                  for your sake.

22:29.347 --> 22:31.848
         What? You mean         
     you knew I was coming?     

22:31.882 --> 22:34.118
            Frasier, darling,   
            yin to my yang,     

22:34.152 --> 22:36.487
            I know your mind    
            as I know my own.   

22:36.521 --> 22:38.922
                Of course I knew
                you'd come.     

22:38.957 --> 22:40.824
                I knew you could
                do no other.    

22:40.858 --> 22:43.159
     Besides, I could hear      
     your muffler behind us     

22:43.194 --> 22:45.662
    all the way up Route 3.     

22:45.697 --> 22:49.499
And what a joke on me.          

22:49.533 --> 22:53.870
What a cruel,                   
wonderful joke on me.           

22:53.905 --> 22:55.805
    Why, Lilith, why?           

22:55.840 --> 22:56.974
      Because I was angry       

22:57.008 --> 22:58.691
        about that              
     prenuptial agreement.      

22:58.726 --> 23:00.877
        Oh.                     
                    And hurt.   

23:00.911 --> 23:01.761
      Look, I'm-I'm sorry       

23:01.796 --> 23:04.164
     I ever brought that up     
      in the first place.       

23:04.199 --> 23:07.067
It's just that I've seen        
so many failed marriages.       

23:08.536 --> 23:10.520
 I just wanted some insurance,  
            I guess.            

23:12.740 --> 23:14.024
        Of course, I...         

23:14.058 --> 23:15.993
     I forgot I'm marrying      
    the perfect woman.          

23:20.464 --> 23:23.033
                  Don't forget  
                  that, Frasier.

23:23.067 --> 23:27.788
      And I certainly didn't    
      mean to hurt you with Sam.

23:27.822 --> 23:30.541
    By the way, what took       
    you so long getting here?   

23:30.575 --> 23:32.543
Oh, well,                       
when I first arrived,           

23:32.577 --> 23:34.211
I went to the wrong room.       

23:34.245 --> 23:36.413
        Uh...                   

23:36.447 --> 23:38.649
By the way,                     
we're having breakfast tomorrow 

23:38.683 --> 23:41.351
with Jack and Peggy             
in number eight.                

23:41.385 --> 23:43.887
    I'm paying.                 

23:43.921 --> 23:46.723
              Frasier, you dear,
              sweet ninny.      

23:48.192 --> 23:49.826
I do love you, you know.        

23:49.861 --> 23:51.762
                And I, you.
