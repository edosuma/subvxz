WEBVTT

00:06.397 --> 00:09.127
Ray, your show was
so amazing.

00:09.166 --> 00:10.133
Thanks.

00:10.167 --> 00:12.067
l wonder if you could
do me a favor.

00:12.102 --> 00:14.070
l'm majoring in Music
Appreciation at U.N. Reno.

00:14.104 --> 00:15.628
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

00:15.673 --> 00:19.734
And l'd like to show you how
much l appreciate your music.

00:19.777 --> 00:24.043
Uh, sorry, my
girlfriend's calling.

00:24.081 --> 00:25.139
Donna?

00:25.182 --> 00:27.116
-How'd you know it was me?
-Lucky guess.

00:27.151 --> 00:29.176
Uh, what's going on down
there-- a beach party?

00:29.219 --> 00:31.187
No, l'm at the Peach Pit.

00:31.221 --> 00:33.815
Clare's having some Open Mic
Night at the After Dark.

00:33.857 --> 00:35.882
l don't know, some
performance art thing.

00:35.926 --> 00:37.791
Sounds pretty deadly.

00:37.828 --> 00:38.920
Well, the club
was doing a lot

00:38.963 --> 00:40.191
better when you
were headlining.

00:40.230 --> 00:42.130
You know, maybe l could talk

00:42.166 --> 00:43.428
to Valerie about you coming...

00:43.467 --> 00:45.128
Look, Donna, l don't need
a manager, okay?

00:45.169 --> 00:46.363
l thought we played this tune.

00:46.403 --> 00:47.370
Okay.

00:47.404 --> 00:49.372
l just...

00:49.406 --> 00:51.431
l'm sorry.

00:51.475 --> 00:53.966
You know l, l can't wait
for you to come home.

00:54.011 --> 00:56.104
Maybe you shouldn't
count on me.

00:56.146 --> 00:58.137
But Saturday's your last show.

00:58.182 --> 00:59.547
l know when my last show is.

00:59.617 --> 01:01.175
l'm just not sure when
l'm gonna get down there.

01:01.218 --> 01:04.381
Ray, it's been two months.
What's going on?

01:04.421 --> 01:05.388
lt's, uh...

01:05.422 --> 01:07.185
lt's complicated.

01:07.224 --> 01:09.624
Well, let me make
it simple for you.

01:09.660 --> 01:11.321
Do you want to see me or not?

01:11.362 --> 01:12.659
You know l do. lt's...

01:12.696 --> 01:14.596
lt's the rest of L.A.
l'm not so crazy about.

01:14.632 --> 01:16.065
Your family, your friends.

01:16.100 --> 01:17.590
l'm just not part of that scene.

01:17.635 --> 01:18.624
Yeah, but Valerie said...

01:18.669 --> 01:19.636
Look, the road is

01:19.670 --> 01:20.637
good for me, okay?

01:20.671 --> 01:22.138
l've been, l've been
writing a lot,

01:22.172 --> 01:23.264
there's no distractions.

01:23.307 --> 01:24.865
You know, maybe l should
just stay on tour.

01:24.908 --> 01:28.400
Well, when am l gonna see you,
or am l just a distraction, too?

01:28.445 --> 01:30.504
Well, get off your butt
and come up here.

01:30.581 --> 01:32.139
We'll go on the road together.

01:32.182 --> 01:34.446
So, that's what l'm supposed
to do for the rest of my life,

01:34.485 --> 01:35.509
just follow you down the road?

01:35.619 --> 01:36.813
l thought you loved me.

01:36.854 --> 01:38.719
Of course l do.

01:38.756 --> 01:40.223
You know that.

01:40.257 --> 01:41.849
Well, good.
Then l'll see you up here.

01:41.892 --> 01:44.053
Ray... Hello?

01:44.094 --> 01:46.892
Donna, l can't hear a word
you're saying, all right?

01:46.930 --> 01:49.023
l-l'll have to call you back
tomorrow, all right?

01:49.066 --> 01:50.226
Love ya.

01:52.236 --> 01:55.603
Yeah, love ya.

03:00.704 --> 03:02.433
On the hook,

03:02.473 --> 03:06.842
l don't know why,
off the hook, l don't know why.

03:06.877 --> 03:09.903
Spawn, lay.

03:09.947 --> 03:11.847
Spawn, lay.

03:11.882 --> 03:15.477
One fish, two fish,
blowfish,

03:15.519 --> 03:18.386
blue fish, live fish,
die fish,

03:18.422 --> 03:20.356
l don't know why fish.

03:20.390 --> 03:21.482
Are you for real,

03:21.525 --> 03:24.688
or are you just reeling me in?

03:24.728 --> 03:25.990
'Cause l'm reeling,

03:26.029 --> 03:28.395
and l'm sinking fast,
hook line and sinker.

03:28.432 --> 03:31.492
My head is swimming,
l'm in over my head,

03:31.568 --> 03:34.935
fishing for compliments,
diving for life...

03:34.972 --> 03:37.634
So, how's it going?

03:37.674 --> 03:42.873
Um, Valerie said
she liked it, so, so...

03:42.913 --> 03:44.175
Fishing for compliments.

03:44.214 --> 03:45.181
Huh.

03:45.215 --> 03:46.876
Diving for life,

03:46.917 --> 03:48.509
in a deep sea-ted boat.

03:48.619 --> 03:50.814
Help me, l'm floundering.

03:50.854 --> 03:52.515
What a disaster!

03:52.623 --> 03:55.148
l'm telling you, Valerie, After
Dark's got an identity crisis.

03:55.192 --> 03:56.625
Since Ray's gone

03:56.660 --> 03:58.525
people don't know what
to expect here anymore.

03:58.595 --> 04:00.495
Can everybody just forget
about Ray Pruit

04:00.531 --> 04:01.828
for about five minutes, okay?

04:01.865 --> 04:04.459
The Peach Pit After Dark
is dying, okay?

04:04.501 --> 04:06.435
Just like that fish
you got out there.

04:06.470 --> 04:07.698
Look, we can't afford

04:07.738 --> 04:09.262
midweek bands
and that's the only thing

04:09.306 --> 04:10.671
that brings in crowds.

04:10.707 --> 04:14.473
You know l'm not
supposed to get involved

04:14.578 --> 04:16.478
in this late-night
club stuff,

04:16.579 --> 04:19.413
you know that, but l'll tell
you what l'd do for you...

04:19.449 --> 04:21.440
What, that sock hop thing?

04:21.485 --> 04:23.214
No, hip-hop thing.

04:23.253 --> 04:24.845
Very big difference.

04:24.888 --> 04:25.980
lt's very cool.

04:26.023 --> 04:27.888
l'm telling you, l've
already got the Funkmeister

04:27.925 --> 04:30.120
David Silver interested
in fronting it.

04:30.160 --> 04:31.821
And that's a selling point?

04:31.862 --> 04:34.092
Oh, you'll see.
He's the man.

04:34.131 --> 04:36.497
l'm telling ya, we'll
get a DJ, spin some tunes,

04:36.533 --> 04:38.125
get a good dance groove going.

04:38.168 --> 04:39.499
lt's pretty cool.

04:39.570 --> 04:40.628
Very cheap.

04:40.671 --> 04:42.161
Cheap is good.

04:44.074 --> 04:46.372
After Dark.

04:46.410 --> 04:49.402
No, l'm sorry,
Valerie isn't here.

04:49.446 --> 04:52.415
No, no, l'm sorry,
Mr. Hud. Um...

04:52.449 --> 04:54.940
Listen, l've got another call.
Can l put you on hold?

04:56.286 --> 04:57.913
And stay there, you jerk!

04:57.955 --> 04:59.820
-What's that all about?
-This Australian

04:59.857 --> 05:01.518
metal death band-- Bloody Roo.

05:01.558 --> 05:04.026
l almost booked them and now
they won't leave me alone.

05:04.061 --> 05:05.995
So how about my idea?

05:06.029 --> 05:10.398
Well, l can book the Australian
death metal band

05:10.434 --> 05:12.664
or the Spawning
Salmon ballet,

05:12.703 --> 05:14.728
or Steve Sanders' special.

05:14.771 --> 05:17.467
l'm telling you, Valerie,
it'll be huge, it'll be so big,

05:17.541 --> 05:20.237
it'll put you on the map,
you'll have your own zip code.

05:20.277 --> 05:23.440
Just don't burn
the place down, okay?

05:26.884 --> 05:28.579
Thank you both for coming.

05:29.887 --> 05:31.411
Don't tell your friends.

05:31.455 --> 05:32.752
Good night.

05:36.059 --> 05:39.187
Well, that rotted huge.

05:39.229 --> 05:40.753
Well, you tried your best.

05:40.797 --> 05:42.162
l know.

05:42.199 --> 05:44.429
That's why it's so depressing.

05:44.468 --> 05:45.799
Donna, you need a ride home?

05:45.836 --> 05:48.202
Um, l think l'm gonna stay
with Clare for awhile.

05:48.238 --> 05:49.967
All right, l'll catch
you two later.

05:50.007 --> 05:53.204
Oh, Monsieur Clever,
''catch you later,'' huh?

05:53.243 --> 05:54.471
What is that?

05:54.511 --> 05:55.739
Some kind of fish

05:55.779 --> 05:57.212
-dig or something?
-See?

05:57.247 --> 05:59.215
There you go, Clare.
lf it moves, dis it.

05:59.249 --> 06:00.477
Come on, you guys.

06:00.517 --> 06:01.541
Lighten up, okay?

06:01.585 --> 06:02.552
Silver!

06:02.586 --> 06:04.451
Just spoke to Valerie, we're on.

06:04.488 --> 06:05.785
You're kidding me?

06:05.822 --> 06:07.289
What? What's on?

06:07.324 --> 06:11.556
Steve and l are now officially
doing a night at the club, too.

06:11.595 --> 06:14.189
Oh, so we're in
competition now, huh?

06:16.366 --> 06:18.334
Oh, Clare, give it
a rest, okay?

06:18.368 --> 06:19.960
Look l-l'm gonna get
out of here.

06:20.003 --> 06:23.268
l suddenly have this
craving for sushi.

06:23.307 --> 06:24.433
lt's...

06:27.244 --> 06:29.804
Everybody is at each
other's throats tonight.

06:29.846 --> 06:31.074
lncluding Ray.

06:31.114 --> 06:33.412
Well, maybe we should
go next door

06:33.450 --> 06:35.281
and consume excess fat grams

06:35.319 --> 06:37.150
to pacify our negative
emotions towards men.

06:37.187 --> 06:39.417
Don't let David get you down.

06:39.456 --> 06:40.423
l know.

06:40.457 --> 06:43.153
He just makes me
so mad, you know.

06:43.193 --> 06:45.184
You know what the
worst part is?

06:45.228 --> 06:47.662
l really miss him.

06:53.770 --> 06:56.034
A perfect 1 ,600 on his S.A.T.'s.

06:56.073 --> 06:58.098
Number one in the National
Merit Scholarship,

06:58.141 --> 07:00.439
Yeah, but was he the MVP
at the Super Bowl?

07:00.477 --> 07:02.877
l'm not embarrassed by
academic recruiting, Brandon.

07:02.913 --> 07:05.404
Warren Gruzin is the top-ranked
high school senior in America.

07:05.449 --> 07:06.814
He could write
his own ticket.

07:06.850 --> 07:08.943
You want me to make sure he
writes C.U. on that ticket?

07:08.986 --> 07:11.454
l will not lose another
recruit to the lvy League.

07:11.521 --> 07:12.988
Especially not
a California boy.

07:13.023 --> 07:14.888
All right, l get the picture.
l'll take care of him.

07:14.925 --> 07:16.586
Good. Because he needs
someone like you

07:16.626 --> 07:17.991
who can speak
his own language.

07:18.028 --> 07:20.758
He's, he's young.

07:20.797 --> 07:22.424
How young?

07:26.036 --> 07:27.469
Well, Warren.

07:27.571 --> 07:30.233
This is, uh,
Brandon Walsh,

07:30.273 --> 07:31.797
he's president of
our student body.

07:31.842 --> 07:33.366
Hey, man.

07:38.882 --> 07:41.908
So, uh... playing a little
Mortal Kombat there?

07:41.952 --> 07:44.477
This is not a Game Boy.

07:44.521 --> 07:45.852
lt's a multitasking notebook

07:45.889 --> 07:48.323
that they gave me as a gift
for visiting M.l.T.

07:51.395 --> 07:52.953
Excuse me.

07:55.732 --> 07:57.359
So, uh, why don't
we just get going?

07:57.401 --> 07:59.699
What part of the campus would
you like to see first?

07:59.736 --> 08:02.102
As if it matters.

08:02.139 --> 08:04.573
Between you and me,
this is a courtesy visit.

08:04.608 --> 08:06.200
Only someone
with half a brain

08:06.243 --> 08:07.938
would choose
C.U. over Harvard.

08:07.978 --> 08:09.605
Which is perhaps
why you're here.

08:09.646 --> 08:14.049
Okay, everything
copasetic?

08:14.084 --> 08:15.915
Brandon?

08:15.952 --> 08:19.820
Oh, yeah, everything's
just ducky, sir.

09:12.209 --> 09:14.234
Hey, wait a second,
what's going on?

09:14.277 --> 09:16.302
-Yo, what's your problem, man?
l didn't do nothing. -What do

09:16.346 --> 09:18.280
you mean? You were playing
with my stuff. -Oh, yeah?

09:18.315 --> 09:20.078
-This your club or something?
-Look, l'm supposed

09:20.117 --> 09:21.584
to be here, okay?

09:21.618 --> 09:24.212
And what's your deal?

09:24.254 --> 09:26.119
-And be straight up or...
-Or what?

09:26.156 --> 09:27.646
You gonna call the cops?

09:27.691 --> 09:30.091
Yeah.

09:30.127 --> 09:32.391
Yeah, well, l'm Juwan.
Willie's nephew.

09:32.429 --> 09:34.397
You do know Willie
the cook, right?

09:34.431 --> 09:36.058
Or do l got
to show l.D.?

09:36.099 --> 09:37.361
You're Willie's nephew?

09:37.400 --> 09:38.731
That's what l said, fool.

09:38.768 --> 09:40.668
Relax, man, come on.
You're a musician.

09:40.704 --> 09:42.695
You know what it's like when
somebody uses your gear.

09:44.708 --> 09:47.268
Look, l'm sorry l went off
on you, all right?

09:47.310 --> 09:49.073
l'm David Silver.

09:51.982 --> 09:55.383
So, what was that thing
you were doing over here?

09:55.418 --> 09:57.386
l don't remember.

09:57.420 --> 09:58.785
Well, l do.

09:58.822 --> 10:00.119
lt went kind of like, uh...

10:05.061 --> 10:08.155
No, man, back up.
lt's more like this, bro.

10:16.006 --> 10:18.167
What the hell is this?

10:19.442 --> 10:21.000
Boy, get your butt
off that stage.

10:21.044 --> 10:23.672
Your shift
just started.

10:23.713 --> 10:25.681
All right, l'm coming.

10:25.715 --> 10:27.182
Willie, why didn't
you tell me

10:27.217 --> 10:28.809
you had a musical genius
in the family?

10:28.852 --> 10:31.184
Oh, is that what he is?

10:31.221 --> 10:32.210
Let's go, Juwan.

10:40.997 --> 10:42.988
Brandon, hi.
Have you seen Valerie?

10:43.033 --> 10:44.728
Uh, over by the
benches, l think,

10:44.768 --> 10:45.792
pretending to study.

10:45.835 --> 10:47.166
Thanks. Can l have a taste?

10:47.204 --> 10:48.535
Ah, better not.

10:48.638 --> 10:51.004
He'll have a fit if it's not
up to his specifications.

10:51.041 --> 10:53.202
He? Who's he?

10:53.243 --> 10:55.211
He who must be obeyed.

10:55.245 --> 10:57.008
Gotta go, the master calls.

10:57.047 --> 10:58.344
Oh...

11:02.686 --> 11:04.984
Who's the babe with
the upper body pride?

11:05.021 --> 11:07.854
Watch your mouth, junior.
She's a friend of mine.

11:07.891 --> 11:09.756
Oh? And does she have
an equally talented

11:09.793 --> 11:11.624
younger sister that you
could fix me up with?

11:11.661 --> 11:13.492
Why don't you just hurry up
and eat that thing.

11:13.563 --> 11:15.224
We got a lot to cover.

11:15.265 --> 11:17.961
When are you gonna show
me something worthwhile?

11:18.001 --> 11:21.095
Well, l hear the mathematics lab
has a display on Fuzzy Logic

11:21.137 --> 11:22.764
that's pretty darn amusing.

11:22.806 --> 11:26.173
l was writing definitive papers
on ''Fuzzy'' in the third grade.

11:26.209 --> 11:28.404
Great, then l'll just take you
back to the Chancellor's office

11:28.445 --> 11:29.844
and we can start off
fresh tomorrow.

11:29.879 --> 11:31.506
No way l'm wasting
an evening

11:31.615 --> 11:33.082
drinking tea and
playing Pictionary.

11:33.116 --> 11:34.208
l'm staying with you.

11:36.519 --> 11:38.111
No, you're not.

11:38.154 --> 11:41.055
Brandon, let me explain this to
you in terms you'll understand.

11:41.091 --> 11:43.525
Warren happy-- Chancellor happy.

11:43.593 --> 11:46.153
Warren unhappy--
Chancellor unhappy.

11:47.631 --> 11:49.758
Okay, again.
Slower this time.

11:49.799 --> 11:50.766
Let me explain

11:50.800 --> 11:54.167
this to you
in terms that you'll understand.

11:54.204 --> 11:55.535
You're not staying with me.

11:55.639 --> 11:57.834
Fine. Then l'll explain
to the Chancellor

11:57.874 --> 11:59.398
that you've made it impossible
for me

11:59.442 --> 12:01.774
to enroll at
dear old C.U.

12:01.811 --> 12:02.971
l'm sure he'll be thrilled

12:03.013 --> 12:05.573
to lose all the research
endowments l represent.

12:05.615 --> 12:07.776
You don't really want
to stay with me.

12:07.817 --> 12:11.378
Yes, l do.

12:18.662 --> 12:20.493
Hey, Val.

12:20.597 --> 12:22.155
Hey.

12:22.198 --> 12:24.792
Look, l... l've been
meaning to talk to you.

12:24.834 --> 12:27.496
Something the matter?

12:27.537 --> 12:29.801
Well, l don't really
know how to say this,

12:29.839 --> 12:32.399
so l guess l'm just going
to come right out and ask you.

12:32.442 --> 12:34.137
Ask me what?

12:34.177 --> 12:37.476
What happened
between you and Ray?

12:37.514 --> 12:38.947
What do you mean?

12:38.982 --> 12:40.472
Well, every time
l mention your name,

12:40.517 --> 12:42.348
he goes nuts.

12:42.385 --> 12:43.977
And when l asked him
about playing

12:44.020 --> 12:45.510
at the Peach Pit
After Dark again,

12:45.622 --> 12:46.816
he bit my head off.

12:46.856 --> 12:51.384
Look, Donna, you and l
are friends, right?

12:51.428 --> 12:53.225
l hope so.

12:53.263 --> 12:54.525
Well, l hope so, too.

12:54.564 --> 12:57.658
And that's why l want
to tell you the truth.

12:57.701 --> 13:00.261
Look, Ray is
a great guy.

13:00.303 --> 13:04.239
And when l first met him,
l was attracted to him.

13:04.274 --> 13:06.799
And l guess l may
have given him

13:06.843 --> 13:08.640
kind of some
mixed signals.

13:08.678 --> 13:11.169
Do l want to hear
the rest of this?

13:11.214 --> 13:13.148
Yeah. You do.

13:13.183 --> 13:14.844
Look, the one thing l know

13:14.884 --> 13:16.613
is how much
Ray really loves you.

13:16.653 --> 13:18.450
l don't know.

13:18.488 --> 13:19.955
l feel like l'm losing him.

13:19.989 --> 13:22.480
No way. He's crazy about you.

13:22.525 --> 13:25.983
He wants me
to come up to Reno.

13:26.029 --> 13:27.587
He thinks l should
drop everything

13:27.630 --> 13:29.154
and go on the road,

13:29.199 --> 13:30.666
like that's a solution
to anything.

13:30.700 --> 13:32.600
So, look, l...

13:32.635 --> 13:34.193
l was wondering
if you could help.

13:34.237 --> 13:35.602
Well, sure. How?

13:35.638 --> 13:36.468
Well, maybe if Ray

13:36.506 --> 13:38.633
felt like he had a place
to play in L.A.,

13:38.675 --> 13:40.700
he would think differently
about coming back.

13:40.744 --> 13:43.508
You know, this could work out
well for the both of us.

13:43.546 --> 13:45.673
l would love to have Ray
playing at the club again.

13:45.715 --> 13:47.273
You would?

13:47.317 --> 13:48.648
That's great.

13:48.685 --> 13:50.983
l feel a thousand times better.

13:51.020 --> 13:53.079
You know, you can call him up
in Reno tonight.

13:53.123 --> 13:54.681
l mean, if that's
not a problem for you.

13:54.724 --> 13:56.123
No. No problem.

13:56.159 --> 13:57.421
lt'll be my pleasure.

13:57.460 --> 13:59.018
Just leave everything to me,
okay?

13:59.062 --> 14:00.620
Okay.

14:07.170 --> 14:09.434
Continue to let go
of everything

14:09.472 --> 14:11.406
but the sound of my voice.

14:11.441 --> 14:13.375
Breathe deeply.

14:13.410 --> 14:17.369
You feel calm, physically
and emotionally refreshed.

14:17.414 --> 14:20.713
Begin to be aware
of your surroundings now,

14:20.750 --> 14:23.275
feel yourself in the room,

14:23.319 --> 14:28.416
and open your eyes
whenever you feel ready.

14:28.458 --> 14:30.255
How do you feel?

14:30.293 --> 14:32.158
Good.

14:32.195 --> 14:33.856
Fine.

14:33.897 --> 14:35.194
l'm ready.

14:35.231 --> 14:38.496
Great.
l think that's enough for now.

14:38.535 --> 14:40.127
Didn't work, huh?

14:40.170 --> 14:41.262
l told you.

14:41.304 --> 14:42.430
lt worked
fine, Dylan.

14:42.472 --> 14:44.838
l just don't want
to go too far too fast.

14:44.874 --> 14:47.468
l was awake the whole time.
Nothing happened.

14:47.510 --> 14:50.172
Well, it's a trance.

14:50.213 --> 14:53.410
lt's not a nap.

14:53.450 --> 14:55.816
l think we could do your
first regression tonight.

14:55.852 --> 14:57.513
You didn't hypnotize me, Molly.

14:57.620 --> 14:58.518
l wasn't out.

14:58.621 --> 14:59.519
Oh, really?

14:59.622 --> 15:01.681
Well, then,
what's that in your hand?

15:01.724 --> 15:03.783
Open it and see.

15:18.875 --> 15:20.740
David, l appreciate

15:20.777 --> 15:23.211
what you're trying to do,
but the boy is trouble.

15:23.246 --> 15:25.476
Can't say no
to a fight.

15:27.083 --> 15:28.983
Hey, Willie.

15:29.018 --> 15:30.383
-Steve.
-What's up?

15:30.420 --> 15:32.684
l just hope you boys
know what you're doing.

15:32.722 --> 15:34.781
Yeah, we do.

15:36.626 --> 15:38.093
What's he talking about?

15:38.127 --> 15:40.095
Well, l found
the dopest young player,

15:40.129 --> 15:42.859
and l want him to, uh, DJ
at the club tomorrow night.

15:42.899 --> 15:44.366
You know,
phatten it up a little bit.

15:44.400 --> 15:45.298
Great. The phatter,
the better.

15:45.335 --> 15:46.962
But what does that have
to do with Willie?

15:47.003 --> 15:49.164
Well, it's Willie's nephew.

15:49.205 --> 15:51.935
That gangster kid?
That gangster kid?

15:51.975 --> 15:54.273
That kid that Nat's
letting wash dishes

15:54.310 --> 15:55.777
so he's not on the street
shooting people?

15:55.812 --> 15:57.040
Nat?

15:57.080 --> 15:59.446
Could you help
me out here, please?

15:59.482 --> 16:02.110
Would you tell Steve

16:02.151 --> 16:04.176
that you give Juwan
your seal of approval?

16:04.220 --> 16:06.120
All l can say is
he's a good kid.

16:06.155 --> 16:07.918
Well, of course he is.

16:07.957 --> 16:09.720
-That's why he's in trouble
with the law. -l would think

16:09.759 --> 16:11.249
that you, of all people,

16:11.294 --> 16:13.819
would understand the concept
of a second chance.

16:13.863 --> 16:15.694
Oh, really?
Well, you know what?

16:15.732 --> 16:17.427
l may screw up now and again,
but at least

16:17.467 --> 16:18.991
l'm not out
doing drive-bys

16:19.035 --> 16:20.002
or selling drugs
on the corner

16:20.036 --> 16:21.298
of Crack and Eight-Ball.

16:21.337 --> 16:22.463
Come on, Steve.

16:22.505 --> 16:25.303
Since l hired him,
he's been on time every day.

16:25.341 --> 16:27.309
He takes two buses
to get here.

16:27.343 --> 16:30.835
How long would you last
at $4.25 an hour?

16:30.880 --> 16:33.110
Great. So let's give
the rich kid a guilt trip.

16:33.149 --> 16:34.480
Steve, come on, man.

16:34.584 --> 16:36.916
He's not a charity case.
He's a really good player.

16:40.290 --> 16:41.814
Well, he is Willie's nephew.

16:41.858 --> 16:46.352
So we're all okay with this now?

16:46.396 --> 16:47.761
Great.

16:47.797 --> 16:50.493
l just gotta get permission
from Juwan's parole officer.

16:51.734 --> 16:53.702
Parole officer?

16:53.736 --> 16:56.364
Steve, l'll take care of it,
okay?

16:58.841 --> 17:01.071
You know,
you don't have to fight.

17:01.110 --> 17:02.202
You don't have to fight.

17:02.245 --> 17:04.839
l don't care what it is,
you ain't gotta fight unless

17:04.881 --> 17:06.906
somebody just commits
to start beating you--

17:06.950 --> 17:08.247
just beating on you.

17:08.284 --> 17:11.720
You know, like they say, you
know, uh... ''Sticks and stones

17:11.753 --> 17:14.723
break my bones. Words never
hurt me.'' That's wrong.

17:14.757 --> 17:17.624
You know, words do hurt,
but yet, still,

17:17.660 --> 17:19.924
you got that... you got
your thoughts in yourself.

17:19.963 --> 17:22.295
So, you... y-you in control
of your mind.

17:22.332 --> 17:25.300
You make, you make your mistakes
and you make your decisions,

17:25.335 --> 17:28.793
and the decision that you need
to make is to squash it.

17:30.673 --> 17:32.573
Let me break you all
to something,

17:32.609 --> 17:34.008
my young brothers and sisters.

17:34.043 --> 17:36.409
lt takes a lot
more heart,

17:36.446 --> 17:38.880
a lot more guts,

17:38.915 --> 17:41.247
to walk away from a fight.

17:41.284 --> 17:43.582
A man needs his props.

17:43.620 --> 17:45.247
That ain't no lie.

17:45.288 --> 17:48.086
But it's like the lce-man says,

17:48.124 --> 17:52.618
''You got to check yourself
before you wreck yourself.''

17:54.597 --> 17:55.962
Squash it!

17:55.999 --> 17:57.864
Walk away.

17:57.900 --> 17:59.834
Chill.

17:59.869 --> 18:01.837
See you next week.

18:01.871 --> 18:03.168
Peace.

18:08.745 --> 18:09.871
Yo, Juwan.

18:09.912 --> 18:13.973
Yo, who's this?
Your white shadow?

18:14.017 --> 18:16.076
Yo, man. Chill out, man.

18:16.119 --> 18:18.383
Yo, l'm not the one
that's dogging you.

18:18.421 --> 18:19.388
Juwan...

18:19.422 --> 18:20.855
Look, what are you
here for, man?

18:20.890 --> 18:22.949
Not a conflict avoidance
class, l take it.

18:22.992 --> 18:25.460
No, man, but that, uh, Squash lt
stuff sounded pretty cool.

18:25.561 --> 18:27.461
-Oh, yeah. Like he knows
about it. -Right.

18:27.530 --> 18:29.361
Look, David, man, my
uncle's gonna pick me up.

18:29.399 --> 18:31.026
He don't like me being
late, all right? So...

18:31.067 --> 18:33.228
Well, no. l already talked to
Willie and your parole officer,

18:33.269 --> 18:34.896
and l'm your designated
driver for tonight.

18:34.937 --> 18:37.462
Juwan, come on, man.
We're not waiting.

18:40.877 --> 18:42.868
Yeah, all right, man.
l'll get with y'all later.

18:46.883 --> 18:49.147
All right, man,
what's this all about?

18:49.185 --> 18:50.948
Well, l'm doing this thing
at the club tomorrow night,

18:50.987 --> 18:53.387
and l wanted to know if, uh, if
you want to be a part of it.

18:53.423 --> 18:54.583
What do you mean? Play?

18:54.624 --> 18:55.648
Yeah.

18:55.692 --> 18:57.182
Yo, l don't think
you talked to Willie.

18:57.226 --> 18:58.193
No, no. lt was

18:58.227 --> 18:59.751
a tough sell, but he agreed.

18:59.796 --> 19:02.128
Why is he always bugging
about your music, anyway?

19:02.165 --> 19:03.860
Man, Willie thinks
there's no difference

19:03.900 --> 19:06.095
between gangsta rap
and gangstas.

19:06.135 --> 19:07.762
l mean, he thinks
music is just

19:07.804 --> 19:09.669
gangs, drugs
and bad news, man.

19:09.706 --> 19:11.298
Then we'll show him it ain't.

19:11.340 --> 19:12.864
We?

19:12.909 --> 19:14.035
Yeah. You and me.

19:15.411 --> 19:17.743
All right. Hey but, you know,
l gotta warn you.

19:17.780 --> 19:20.078
-l never played in front
of a crowd. -Yeah, well, that

19:20.116 --> 19:22.414
makes us even, 'cause l haven't
played in about a year.

19:23.686 --> 19:25.620
So what do you think?

19:25.655 --> 19:28.021
l think we need to rehearse.

19:28.057 --> 19:31.117
Great, man. Then, uh, you'll
come by tomorrow morning,

19:31.160 --> 19:32.218
and we'll
take it from there.

19:32.261 --> 19:33.228
Cool.

19:33.262 --> 19:34.229
Cool, man.

19:34.263 --> 19:36.026
All right, man.

19:39.035 --> 19:41.003
lt smells like
Kelly's perfume.

19:41.037 --> 19:42.334
lt's Wisteria.

19:42.371 --> 19:44.430
lt's supposed to help
open the door

19:44.474 --> 19:46.635
between the conscious
and the subconscious.

19:46.676 --> 19:48.371
You ready?

19:48.411 --> 19:49.878
Yeah.

19:49.912 --> 19:52.073
Okay.

19:52.115 --> 19:54.481
Good. Now, picture yourself

19:54.550 --> 19:57.917
at the top
of a long, long staircase.

19:57.954 --> 20:02.152
And as you step down,
each step you take,

20:02.191 --> 20:06.184
you get more and more relaxed.

20:06.229 --> 20:08.720
Good. Now, step down...

20:08.765 --> 20:14.203
deeper... deeper...

20:14.237 --> 20:17.070
Good.

20:17.106 --> 20:19.597
There's a feeling
you have.

20:19.642 --> 20:23.237
You feel it
in your stomach.

20:23.279 --> 20:27.545
Go back to a time
when you felt it before.

20:30.486 --> 20:32.511
What do you see?

20:32.588 --> 20:34.283
l don't know.

20:35.892 --> 20:39.089
l can't see. lt's foggy.

20:39.128 --> 20:43.155
lt's real cold and dark.

20:46.002 --> 20:48.527
Where? Where are you?

20:48.571 --> 20:50.038
There's a train.

20:50.072 --> 20:53.064
A train is coming,
and there's...

20:53.109 --> 20:55.407
there's a bell ringing.

20:55.444 --> 20:57.639
There's a bell. lt's ringing.

20:57.680 --> 21:02.549
lt's ringing. lt's ringing.

21:09.959 --> 21:12.086
Hello. This is a
computer-generated phone call.

21:12.128 --> 21:13.095
Did you know there...?

21:13.129 --> 21:15.222
-Damn it!
-l'm sorry. That was my fault.

21:15.264 --> 21:17.732
l should have turned off
the stupid phone.

21:17.767 --> 21:23.706
lt was me... but it wasn't me.

21:23.739 --> 21:26.333
l was in some kind
of railyard.

21:26.375 --> 21:27.933
There was this old

21:27.977 --> 21:29.501
car-- you know, like...

21:29.612 --> 21:32.206
like a... like a Model-T.

21:32.248 --> 21:36.514
l mean, it must have been the
1920s or the-the '30s.

21:36.552 --> 21:39.419
You have made
incredible progress.

21:39.455 --> 21:41.320
Next time, it's going
to be even easier.

21:41.357 --> 21:42.324
Next time?

21:42.358 --> 21:44.417
What about now?

21:44.460 --> 21:45.427
l think you need

21:45.461 --> 21:48.089
to be in a more relaxed state.

21:48.130 --> 21:49.529
lt'll be better tomorrow.

21:49.565 --> 21:50.930
Tomorrow?

21:50.967 --> 21:52.059
Don't look
so worried.

21:52.101 --> 21:54.194
You'll get on that train.

21:54.237 --> 21:56.228
Maybe that's what
l'm worried about.

21:58.274 --> 22:00.401
Eh, Brandon will be
fine on the sofa--

22:00.443 --> 22:01.740
don't you worry
about anything.

22:01.777 --> 22:03.677
Cornell will put me
in a four-star hotel

22:03.713 --> 22:05.340
with 24-hour room service.

22:05.381 --> 22:08.009
Well, there's a bag of
chips in the desk, chief.

22:08.050 --> 22:09.608
And, uh, thanks for your tip

22:09.652 --> 22:11.483
on the reverse-amortization
formula.

22:11.587 --> 22:13.111
No prob.

22:15.491 --> 22:17.891
You didn't tell me
you live with your parents.

22:17.927 --> 22:19.360
That's so pathetic.

22:19.395 --> 22:20.623
lt's called reality.

22:20.663 --> 22:22.631
You might want to
check it out sometime.

22:22.665 --> 22:24.189
You know, you better hope
you inherited

22:24.233 --> 22:25.598
your mother's genetic
information,

22:25.635 --> 22:27.500
otherwise you're gonna
be an early candidate

22:27.570 --> 22:30.061
for the Hair Club for Men.

22:30.106 --> 22:33.667
Warren, at the other
campuses you visited,

22:33.709 --> 22:36.872
how many of your tour guides
beat you senseless?

22:36.913 --> 22:39.245
Brandon, you decent?

22:41.083 --> 22:42.846
Oh, uh, l'm sorry,

22:42.885 --> 22:44.716
l didn't know it was,
uh, Boy Scout night.

22:45.755 --> 22:47.279
Warren, this is Valerie.

22:47.323 --> 22:49.120
She's a student at C.U.

22:49.158 --> 22:50.523
Warren is touring
the campus.

22:50.593 --> 22:52.322
Junior high field trip?

22:53.829 --> 22:55.126
You can breathe now.

22:55.164 --> 22:56.529
Uh, hi.

22:56.599 --> 22:58.590
Cute.

22:59.602 --> 23:01.467
That was smooth.

23:16.118 --> 23:17.312
Hello?

23:17.353 --> 23:18.342
Hi. How you doing, Ray?

23:18.387 --> 23:19.479
Who's this?

23:19.555 --> 23:21.785
You know, l'm crushed
you don't recognize my voice.

23:21.824 --> 23:24.088
Look, l don't have anything
to say to you, Valerie.

23:24.126 --> 23:25.855
Not now, not ever.

23:33.336 --> 23:35.861
When's Valerie
coming, anyway?

23:35.905 --> 23:37.338
l just talked to her.

23:37.373 --> 23:38.931
She's on her way.

23:38.975 --> 23:40.772
l been waiting
all bloody morning.

23:40.810 --> 23:42.971
And how come there
ain't no Bloody Roo

23:43.012 --> 23:44.775
on this bloody jukebox?

23:44.814 --> 23:47.510
What's wrong with helping
Ray's career a little?

23:47.550 --> 23:49.017
You know, behind
every successful man

23:49.051 --> 23:50.780
is the woman
who makes it necessary.

23:50.820 --> 23:53.516
That has always sounded
a little sexual to me.

23:53.622 --> 23:54.884
Guys, can we please

23:54.924 --> 23:57.518
not talk about sex
when l'm not having any?

23:57.560 --> 23:59.960
-Join the club.
-Join the club.

23:59.996 --> 24:01.122
Well, l thought

24:01.163 --> 24:02.790
things were going
better for you guys.

24:02.832 --> 24:03.890
Yeah, little by little.

24:03.933 --> 24:05.696
l'm even getting
to like the idea

24:05.735 --> 24:06.724
of ldaho.

24:06.769 --> 24:08.031
Am l crazy or what?

24:08.070 --> 24:10.698
No. Not if Jesse
makes you happy.

24:10.740 --> 24:12.139
'Ello, darlin'.

24:12.174 --> 24:15.473
Want to play a little
Kookaburra Carnival?

24:15.511 --> 24:16.978
Kookaburra what?

24:17.013 --> 24:18.139
lt's a game.

24:18.180 --> 24:20.876
You lie on top of me,
and l guess your weight.

24:22.551 --> 24:24.451
Just double your lQ.

24:24.487 --> 24:25.613
Oh...

24:27.256 --> 24:29.884
Oh, Hud, l'd like you
to meet, uh...

24:29.925 --> 24:31.722
Kristin.
Kristin MacDougal.

24:31.761 --> 24:33.626
We spoke
on the telephone.

24:33.662 --> 24:34.924
Kristin...

24:34.964 --> 24:37.933
Mr. Hud is extremely anxious
to see Valerie.

24:37.967 --> 24:39.594
Well, l'm sorry,
Valerie is unavailable.

24:39.635 --> 24:42.604
Look, l've had it with
your bloody excuses.

24:42.638 --> 24:44.037
Valerie booked Bloody Roo,

24:44.073 --> 24:46.598
and she's gonna bloody
well pay for Bloody Roo

24:46.642 --> 24:47.904
before we leave
town tomorrow.

24:47.943 --> 24:49.740
Well, unfortunately,
Valerie's under the weather.

24:49.779 --> 24:51.440
Poor old thing had gum surgery.

24:51.480 --> 24:53.710
And at her age, you know,
it could be very serious.

24:53.749 --> 24:54.773
Bloody hell!

24:54.817 --> 24:57.752
Somebody's gonna pay for
this-- bloody big-time!

24:57.787 --> 24:59.778
Bye, luv.

25:02.224 --> 25:06.183
l got to say, David's
looking better and better.

25:20.476 --> 25:22.467
Hey, that's not
bad for, um...

25:22.578 --> 25:24.136
For a what?
Come on, man.

25:24.180 --> 25:26.341
l may be white,
but l ain't Vanilla.

25:26.382 --> 25:29.351
There you go, now you got some
style to it, there you go.

25:29.385 --> 25:31.353
Of course, man--
you taught me how to do it.

25:31.387 --> 25:33.446
Come on, don't
leave me hanging.

25:33.489 --> 25:36.219
lt ain't the worst thing
l ever heard, now.

25:43.532 --> 25:45.329
Straight up, man...

25:45.367 --> 25:47.392
why you doing this?

25:47.436 --> 25:49.097
l mean, why you
putting yourself out for me?

25:49.138 --> 25:51.231
Come on, man, it's no mystery--
l like the way you play.

25:51.273 --> 25:53.332
And you're hoping some of this
will rub off on you, right?

25:53.375 --> 25:55.138
Well, of course.

25:55.177 --> 25:57.168
So what, do l pass
your soul test?

25:57.213 --> 25:58.976
We gigging tonight,
or what?

25:59.014 --> 26:00.982
Okay. Just as long
as you don't push

26:01.016 --> 26:02.449
none of that
''ebony-ivory'' noise on me.

26:02.518 --> 26:03.780
All right, man,
look, 6:00

26:03.819 --> 26:05.446
we'll be here
for sound check, all right?

26:05.521 --> 26:07.614
-Make sure and bring
some of your boys. -Yo, okay.

26:07.656 --> 26:09.283
l got a rapper
or two we can add.

26:09.325 --> 26:11.452
Yo, take some flyers
down to the center, too.

26:11.527 --> 26:13.427
We need all the people
we can get.

26:14.463 --> 26:15.987
6:00?

26:16.031 --> 26:17.760
Yeah.

26:17.800 --> 26:20.098
Yo, man, you better hurry up-- l
promised Willie you wouldn't be

26:20.136 --> 26:21.831
-late for your shift.
-All right.

26:21.871 --> 26:23.168
All right, man,
l'll see you.

26:23.205 --> 26:25.036
See you later, man.

26:28.978 --> 26:31.412
What are you, nuts?
Giving him flyers?

26:31.447 --> 26:33.039
Steve, what are you
talking about?

26:33.082 --> 26:34.174
You might as well

26:34.216 --> 26:36.878
take an ad out in the
Bloods and Crips newsletter.

26:36.919 --> 26:38.648
-Look, if you have a problem...
-What l have

26:38.687 --> 26:40.484
is a probation officer--
just like the one

26:40.556 --> 26:42.114
your little reclamation
project's got.

26:42.158 --> 26:43.318
Hey, that's harsh, man.

26:43.359 --> 26:45.156
So's putting my head
on the chopping block

26:45.194 --> 26:46.491
when l asked
you not to.

26:46.529 --> 26:48.827
You know l got
a court order against me.

26:48.864 --> 26:50.923
l'm not gonna risk
doing time in jail

26:50.966 --> 26:52.763
just so you can
play social worker.

26:52.801 --> 26:54.860
Steve, that's not
what's happening here.

26:54.904 --> 26:58.499
lf you want the hip-hop night
to happen so bad, fine.

26:58.607 --> 27:02.065
But from this point on,
you're on your own.

27:14.790 --> 27:17.452
Yo, where'd you get
your fly gear?

27:17.526 --> 27:19.858
Must be Midnight Music Supply.

27:19.895 --> 27:22.489
Yo, that's David's stuff,
man-- don't mess with it.

27:26.735 --> 27:28.225
After Dark.

27:28.270 --> 27:30.238
Hey, David.
Let me talk to Steve.

27:30.272 --> 27:31.637
Steve's not around yet.

27:31.674 --> 27:34.165
All right. Um, listen,
tell him something came up.

27:34.210 --> 27:36.110
l've got to go out of town.

27:36.145 --> 27:38.443
He's gonna have to handle
everything by himself.

27:38.480 --> 27:41.313
All right, l'll, uh, l'll
give him the message. Thanks.

27:41.350 --> 27:43.318
Bye.

27:43.352 --> 27:45.149
Uh, can you speed it up?

27:45.187 --> 27:48.020
l got to catch
a 7:00 flight to Reno.

27:48.057 --> 27:49.888
So, who was that?

27:49.925 --> 27:53.622
The boss-- she's not
coming in tonight.

27:53.662 --> 27:56.495
So then who's
running the club?

27:56.565 --> 27:58.556
Guess we are.

28:03.539 --> 28:07.737
Remind me to thank Steve for
taking Warren off my hands.

28:07.776 --> 28:10.074
l don't know what you've
been complaining about.

28:10.112 --> 28:12.046
He seems like
a perfectly nice boy.

28:12.081 --> 28:14.606
That's only because
you don't know him.

28:17.286 --> 28:18.913
Kelly, you're up.

28:18.954 --> 28:20.012
Thanks.

28:20.055 --> 28:21.317
He's just lonely.

28:21.357 --> 28:23.689
He told me you haven't
been very nice to him.

28:27.429 --> 28:28.726
Well, it's official:

28:28.764 --> 28:31.028
we're gonna make
him a KEG man.

28:31.066 --> 28:32.363
You're pledging him?

28:32.401 --> 28:35.165
l got to have somebody
to do my homework.

28:35.204 --> 28:38.002
Yow! That is so gross!

28:38.040 --> 28:39.473
-What happened?
-l don't know,

28:39.541 --> 28:41.600
why don't you ask
your little pledge here?

28:41.644 --> 28:43.271
-What happened?
-What'd you do, Warren?

28:43.312 --> 28:45.007
Uh, l kind of lost control

28:45.047 --> 28:46.139
of my cue.

28:46.181 --> 28:47.273
Hey, don't

28:47.316 --> 28:48.874
blame it on me-- it's gravity.

28:48.917 --> 28:50.714
All right, that's it--
first you apologize to her,

28:50.753 --> 28:53.187
and then you go get a mop
and you clean this up.

28:53.222 --> 28:55.417
And you can go crying
to the Chancellor all you want

28:55.457 --> 28:57.755
because we both know you
ain't coming to this school.

28:57.793 --> 29:00.455
And as student body president,
l got to tell you something--

29:00.496 --> 29:01.895
we don't want you!

29:08.237 --> 29:10.364
Brandon, he's
just a little boy.

29:10.406 --> 29:12.874
That little boy
had to be stopped.

29:12.908 --> 29:14.773
He's a menace to society.

29:16.111 --> 29:17.738
Warren's disappeared.

29:17.780 --> 29:19.304
-What?
-Back door's open.

29:19.348 --> 29:20.940
He's gone.

29:54.350 --> 29:57.842
Hey, Willie, it's all right
to enjoy this, you know.

30:05.327 --> 30:06.624
No, l can't really stay.

30:06.662 --> 30:09.392
l, uh, l just want to
show David some support.

30:09.431 --> 30:12.400
How do you stay friends with
someone after you break up?

30:12.434 --> 30:13.867
l could never do that.

30:13.902 --> 30:15.199
Oh, really?

30:15.237 --> 30:16.727
Then why'd you come?

30:16.772 --> 30:18.000
David!

30:23.078 --> 30:24.841
Oh, he's happy now.

30:24.880 --> 30:27.110
Guess what you're gonna
be doing after the show.

30:27.149 --> 30:30.050
l don't think so, man,
not for a long time.

30:30.085 --> 30:31.518
Really? What about
the other one?

30:31.620 --> 30:33.087
No, man, she's an ex, too.

30:33.122 --> 30:35.522
Really, man? She's giving
you the big old eyes, man.

30:35.557 --> 30:36.649
You better get that.

30:36.692 --> 30:37.681
l don't think so, man.

30:37.726 --> 30:40.194
You know what, you have
a lot to learn about women,

30:40.229 --> 30:44.131
and, uh, that woman is
not giving me the big eye.

30:44.166 --> 30:45.633
Whatever.

30:45.667 --> 30:48.033
You know, l've never seen
David onstage before.

30:48.070 --> 30:49.264
He's hot.

30:49.304 --> 30:50.771
What'd l tell you?

30:50.806 --> 30:53.104
Well, it could be
an interesting evening.

30:54.076 --> 30:55.703
Ha. Well, good luck.

30:55.744 --> 30:57.735
And if you see Valerie,
will you tell her

30:57.780 --> 30:59.975
-l want to know what happened
with Ray? -Yeah, sure.

31:00.015 --> 31:01.141
-Good night.
-Good night.

31:10.959 --> 31:12.586
l told you--
you ain't on the list.

31:12.628 --> 31:15.290
And l don't know what old
lady you're talking about.

31:15.330 --> 31:16.456
Valerie.

31:16.498 --> 31:18.432
The old dear who
owns this hole.

31:18.467 --> 31:21.095
Whatever you're on, man,
you ought to bottle it.

31:21.136 --> 31:22.831
This is Valerie.

31:24.706 --> 31:26.469
Right, mate.

31:26.508 --> 31:28.499
l'm sorry for your troubles.

31:28.577 --> 31:30.374
This is for
the four of us.

31:30.412 --> 31:32.607
The rest is for you.
Let's go.

31:49.198 --> 31:52.964
Hey, Hud, this place
is a bleedin' tea social.

31:53.001 --> 31:54.263
Let's blow.

31:54.303 --> 31:56.931
Don't you think we owe it
to dear old Valerie

31:56.972 --> 31:59.099
to have at least
a dance or two?

32:08.617 --> 32:10.346
l'm gonna call the cops.

32:10.385 --> 32:12.046
l knew there'd
be trouble.

32:13.088 --> 32:14.487
Why don't you
watch it, man?!

32:14.523 --> 32:15.581
Shove, it mate!

32:18.827 --> 32:20.021
Hey, hey, guys,

32:20.062 --> 32:22.223
people, come on,
everybody relax.

32:22.264 --> 32:23.322
This is just a party.

32:31.507 --> 32:32.599
David, you okay, man?

32:32.641 --> 32:33.630
Yeah, man, l'm fine.

32:33.675 --> 32:35.040
Move over, boys.

32:35.077 --> 32:36.704
Your gig's over.

32:36.745 --> 32:38.770
The people want
to hear Bloody Roo.

32:38.814 --> 32:40.247
-Right, lads?
-That's right! -Right!

32:40.282 --> 32:42.250
Juwan, we can take
these crackers, man.

32:42.284 --> 32:43.410
Just say the word.

32:43.452 --> 32:44.851
Yo, come on, seriously,
can't we...

32:44.887 --> 32:46.821
Bloody Roo!
Bloody Roo!

32:46.855 --> 32:48.823
-Bloody Roo! -Bloody Roo!
No more monkey music!

32:48.857 --> 32:50.347
Yo, what did he just say?

32:50.392 --> 32:51.484
Yo, go home, man.

32:51.527 --> 32:52.721
Get off the bloody stage!

32:52.761 --> 32:54.956
We ain't going nowhere, fool!
My boys are strapped!

32:54.997 --> 32:57.192
-What's up? -Yo, seriously,
man, we don't need any trouble.

32:57.232 --> 32:59.359
Oh, yeah?

32:59.401 --> 33:00.459
Juwan!

33:00.502 --> 33:01.833
Check yourself.

33:01.870 --> 33:03.701
Nah, sit down, Willie--
you gonna live your whole life

33:03.739 --> 33:05.001
without respect,
go ahead.

33:05.040 --> 33:06.337
l ain't going out
like that.

33:06.375 --> 33:07.467
Yeah, sit
down, Willie!

33:07.543 --> 33:09.272
-Juwan... -Nah, this ain't
your fight, David.

33:09.311 --> 33:11.336
Nobody's fighting here.
Baby boy's just talking.

33:11.380 --> 33:12.278
Man, shut up, man!

33:12.314 --> 33:13.474
Let's boogie!

33:13.549 --> 33:15.710
Juwan! Don't let him
do it to you, man. Come on!

33:25.327 --> 33:27.693
You know what l say, man?

33:27.729 --> 33:29.788
The stage is yours.

33:38.507 --> 33:40.498
What the hell is that?

33:40.576 --> 33:43.238
Squash it, man, we out.

33:47.883 --> 33:49.714
l knew you were cowards!

33:49.751 --> 33:50.718
Cowards.

33:51.520 --> 33:54.080
You're all bloody cowards!

33:54.823 --> 33:56.381
Yeah!

33:56.425 --> 33:58.552
Roo! Bloody Roo!

34:02.397 --> 34:05.161
Yeah, l'll be right there.

34:06.268 --> 34:08.202
Hold on a second.

34:13.208 --> 34:14.333
Hi.

34:15.476 --> 34:17.001
Aren't you gonna
invite me in?

34:17.045 --> 34:18.170
What are you doing here?

34:18.213 --> 34:20.443
Donna sent me.

34:20.482 --> 34:23.246
Aren't you supposed to be
running a club or something?

34:23.284 --> 34:25.719
lt runs itself.

34:36.831 --> 34:38.264
Can you feel the track?

34:38.300 --> 34:40.495
What do you see?

34:42.771 --> 34:44.500
Moonlight.

34:44.572 --> 34:47.507
l see moonlight.

34:47.542 --> 34:51.342
l'm on a train
and it's moving.

34:51.380 --> 34:54.007
l smell hay...

34:54.049 --> 34:57.815
w-wine...

34:57.853 --> 34:59.320
something else.

34:59.354 --> 35:00.514
l'm not alone.

35:02.457 --> 35:04.118
What good's all
that writing

35:04.159 --> 35:06.423
if you ain't gonna
let nobody read it?

35:06.461 --> 35:08.190
lt's not writing.

35:08.230 --> 35:10.027
lt will be someday.

35:10.065 --> 35:13.501
lt's just a bunch
of words right now.

35:19.074 --> 35:21.770
Wake up, ya bums!

35:37.092 --> 35:39.287
Nah, this one's clean.

35:55.444 --> 35:57.708
All right. Come on out.

36:01.550 --> 36:03.142
Bingo!

36:03.185 --> 36:04.209
Ain't you a sweet thing?

36:04.252 --> 36:05.219
Please!

36:05.253 --> 36:06.982
Please!

36:07.022 --> 36:08.011
Hey!

36:08.056 --> 36:10.581
Hey what, Mac?
What are ya gonna do?!

36:10.625 --> 36:12.183
Come on!

36:16.798 --> 36:18.265
Yeah, big man.

36:18.300 --> 36:20.029
l'll be seein' ya,
big man.

36:20.068 --> 36:21.262
No, please!

36:21.303 --> 36:23.464
Help me! Please!

36:23.572 --> 36:26.632
Please! Please, help me!

36:28.810 --> 36:30.801
You all right?

36:44.326 --> 36:45.918
Now listen,
straight up, man,

36:45.961 --> 36:48.122
l didn't think that ''squash it''
rap would do squat.

36:48.163 --> 36:50.654
Then why'd you do it?

36:50.699 --> 36:52.963
Man, l couldn't think
of anything else.

36:53.001 --> 36:54.969
But you know, man...

36:55.003 --> 36:57.403
that was one hard walk
to the door, you know?

36:57.439 --> 37:00.670
l feel you, man,
but you did it.

37:00.709 --> 37:03.109
Come on, Juwan.
Let's get home.

37:03.145 --> 37:05.841
Yo, you mad at me,
Uncle Willie?

37:05.881 --> 37:07.508
No, boy.
l'm proud of you.

37:08.650 --> 37:10.584
Yo, later on, David.

37:10.619 --> 37:11.745
All right, man.

37:14.790 --> 37:18.089
Well, l guess there
won't be any hip-hop nights

37:18.126 --> 37:19.093
in the near future.

37:19.127 --> 37:20.992
Why not?
Did you see the door?

37:21.029 --> 37:22.587
So what?

37:22.631 --> 37:24.292
The whole night was
a total disaster.

37:24.332 --> 37:27.631
There was no security, the front
of the club was a total mess.

37:27.669 --> 37:29.398
You know what?
You just can't stand the fact

37:29.437 --> 37:31.962
that my night did better
than yours, okay?

37:32.007 --> 37:33.474
You know, you can just...

37:33.508 --> 37:34.475
Hey, David,

37:34.509 --> 37:37.535
squash it.

37:39.548 --> 37:41.482
Please accept my apology

37:41.516 --> 37:46.010
for everything l've ever done
or will do in the future.

37:46.054 --> 37:48.147
You know what really bugs me?

37:48.190 --> 37:50.624
Oh, l'm afraid to ask.

37:50.659 --> 37:55.562
You were so hot up there,
l actually liked hip-hop.

37:56.832 --> 38:00.268
Well, almost, anyway.

38:04.806 --> 38:06.774
What was that for?

38:06.808 --> 38:09.106
l don't know.

38:09.144 --> 38:11.612
A preview
of coming attractions?

38:11.646 --> 38:13.045
David and Clare, Part ll?

38:13.081 --> 38:14.844
You know what?
lt's funny you said that

38:14.883 --> 38:17.579
'cause l always thought sequels
were so underrated.

38:26.828 --> 38:29.456
l don't get you, Valerie.

38:29.531 --> 38:30.657
l never did.

38:30.699 --> 38:32.326
That's why
l flew up here, Ray.

38:32.367 --> 38:34.130
l didn't want you to
misunderstand my intentions.

38:34.169 --> 38:35.466
Look, l got a show.

38:35.503 --> 38:37.334
So why don't you tell me
what you want,

38:37.372 --> 38:39.932
l'll say no, and we can
both get on with our lives?

38:39.975 --> 38:44.412
Okay. Donna needs you.

38:44.446 --> 38:45.913
She needs you back in L.A.

38:45.947 --> 38:47.710
What does this have to do
with you?

38:47.749 --> 38:48.977
Look, l want
to help Donna,

38:49.017 --> 38:51.178
and l want to help you.

38:51.219 --> 38:53.710
l'm asking you to play
at the After Dark.

38:53.755 --> 38:55.052
And...?

38:55.090 --> 38:56.079
That's it.

38:56.124 --> 38:57.751
There's no hidden agenda.

38:57.792 --> 38:59.316
l get it.

38:59.361 --> 39:00.885
The club's bombing
and you need me.

39:00.929 --> 39:02.362
The club is doing fine.

39:02.397 --> 39:03.364
lt's cool.

39:03.398 --> 39:04.422
This l can deal with.

39:04.532 --> 39:06.295
lt's not me and Donna
you want to help. lt's you.

39:06.334 --> 39:08.427
Look, Ray, this isn't about me.

39:08.503 --> 39:09.663
lt's always about you, Valerie.

39:10.939 --> 39:13.635
But if l do come back,
it'll be on my terms.

39:13.675 --> 39:17.111
Okay, whatever you want.

39:17.145 --> 39:20.410
This is more than business,
it's friendship.

39:20.448 --> 39:23.440
You know, it's funny,
but l almost believe you.

39:23.551 --> 39:25.883
People can change...

39:25.921 --> 39:27.445
if you let 'em.

39:30.292 --> 39:31.919
Dylan, just because
you saw it,

39:31.960 --> 39:34.929
it doesn't mean
that it happened.

39:34.963 --> 39:36.555
l mean, sometimes
it could just be

39:36.598 --> 39:39.965
a message from the subconscious,
you know, like a dream.

39:40.001 --> 39:41.935
Yeah, like a nightmare.

39:41.970 --> 39:44.734
Well, we look to our past
to heal our future.

39:44.773 --> 39:47.139
Even if it was true...

39:47.175 --> 39:48.665
lt was true.

39:48.710 --> 39:50.473
l know it's true like l know
l'm sitting here.

39:50.578 --> 39:51.772
What l don't know is why.

39:51.813 --> 39:53.838
Well, maybe the real question
is who?

39:53.882 --> 39:55.611
l don't understand.

39:55.650 --> 39:59.086
What you just experienced could
be just one link in the chain.

39:59.120 --> 40:01.111
Maybe the answer lies
further back.

40:01.156 --> 40:03.386
You think l knew this girl
in a different lifetime?

40:03.425 --> 40:04.414
lt's possible

40:04.459 --> 40:06.689
you were betrayed
by another woman,

40:06.728 --> 40:09.856
that your heart shut down
in order to survive.

40:09.898 --> 40:11.661
Anyway,

40:11.700 --> 40:15.466
what you did isn't as important
as what you're gonna do.

40:15.503 --> 40:16.936
What's that?

40:16.972 --> 40:19.634
Find out the truth
about yourself.

40:28.984 --> 40:30.508
Did you hear
what happened?

40:30.552 --> 40:32.611
Steve called,
so did Chancellor Arnold.

40:32.654 --> 40:34.747
-You know, l have to tell you...
-You know, Dad,

40:34.789 --> 40:36.723
l don't care about the
Chancellor,

40:36.758 --> 40:37.986
l don't care
about the endowment.

40:38.026 --> 40:39.516
What if something's happened
to the kid?

40:39.561 --> 40:41.529
Nothing happened to Warren.
He's here.

40:41.563 --> 40:42.928
He is?

40:42.964 --> 40:44.454
Yeah, he's in the kitchen.

40:51.706 --> 40:52.968
How did you get here?

40:53.008 --> 40:55.203
Duh. l took a cab.

40:55.243 --> 40:56.301
ls he okay?

40:56.344 --> 40:57.538
He's been here
about an hour.

40:57.579 --> 40:58.546
He's fine.

40:58.580 --> 41:00.138
Good.
Now l can kill him.

41:00.181 --> 41:02.411
First you can have
some ice cream.

41:02.450 --> 41:06.079
And then you two
will talk.

41:15.830 --> 41:18.390
l don't like it
when people yell at me.

41:18.433 --> 41:19.400
You know, Warren,

41:19.434 --> 41:20.628
if you're gonna go to college,

41:20.668 --> 41:23.000
you're gonna have to learn how
to be a little more mature.

41:24.906 --> 41:26.498
l don't want to go to college.

41:26.541 --> 41:29.339
l thought that was the whole
point of this exercise.

41:29.377 --> 41:31.641
Well, l kind of have to.

41:31.679 --> 41:34.705
l can't just stay home
and do nothing.

41:34.749 --> 41:37.217
But if l leave,
then l'll miss my family...

41:37.252 --> 41:39.220
my dog, my room.

41:39.254 --> 41:40.721
l have a really great room.

41:40.755 --> 41:44.452
You know, l thought a smart guy
like you

41:44.492 --> 41:45.516
would've figured this out.

41:45.560 --> 41:47.528
What? l should go to Harvard?

41:47.562 --> 41:52.431
No. Aren't there any colleges
near where you live?

41:52.467 --> 41:54.492
Yeah, a state school.

41:54.536 --> 41:57.664
Well, l know a lot
of extremely cool people

41:57.705 --> 41:59.673
that go to state schools
and live at home.

41:59.707 --> 42:01.607
-Guys like you.
-You go there

42:01.643 --> 42:03.838
for a couple of years, you
transfer when you're ready.

42:06.247 --> 42:07.839
Maybe l will.

42:07.882 --> 42:12.114
l guess our family atmosphere
kind of rubbed off on you, huh?

42:12.153 --> 42:13.120
Yeah!

42:13.154 --> 42:14.917
l'll never forget
Valerie's hooters.

42:26.768 --> 42:27.735
-Hey.
-Hey.

42:27.769 --> 42:28.736
Thanks for waiting.

42:28.770 --> 42:30.931
Well, everybody wants
a piece of the star.

42:30.972 --> 42:32.496
l'm no star.

42:32.574 --> 42:33.666
Well, not yet.

42:33.708 --> 42:36.268
But the After Dark crowd's
really in for a treat.

42:36.311 --> 42:38.541
Yeah, l'm looking forward to
going back, playing again.

42:39.714 --> 42:42.911
Oh, is that all
you're looking forward to?

42:42.951 --> 42:44.248
And seeing Donna.

42:44.285 --> 42:46.412
Then my work here is done.

42:46.454 --> 42:49.355
What?

42:49.390 --> 42:50.652
l don't know.

42:50.692 --> 42:51.750
You just, uh...

42:51.793 --> 42:52.782
You're really different.

42:52.827 --> 42:54.624
l'm trying to be.

42:54.662 --> 42:55.720
Come on.

42:55.763 --> 42:57.958
l'll give you a ride
to the motel.

42:57.999 --> 42:59.091
l'm still pretty
wound up.

42:59.134 --> 43:01.500
Yeah, me, too.
lt was a great show.

43:01.536 --> 43:04.198
Thanks. You wanna grab a
cup of coffee or something?

43:07.675 --> 43:10.109
Or something.

43:10.145 --> 43:12.375
l thought you changed.
