00:01.802 --> 00:11.279
(Music)

00:11.312 --> 00:12.680
Jack!

00:12.713 --> 00:13.881
Welcome to Sweden.

00:13.914 --> 00:16.117
Thank you.
You must be The Guy?

00:16.150 --> 00:17.718
I am The Guy.
I'm the Stockholm Guy.

00:17.751 --> 00:19.620
I'll get you
anything you need.

00:19.653 --> 00:21.021
Get over here.
What?

00:21.055 --> 00:22.056
Man hug.

00:22.090 --> 00:23.191
Give it. Give it!

00:25.226 --> 00:26.760
I can't tell you
how excited I am,

00:26.794 --> 00:28.329
I've been practicing
my Swedish.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.064
Check it out.

00:30.098 --> 00:33.367
(Speaking in Swedish)

00:33.401 --> 00:34.402
Okay, I don't know
what that means.

00:34.435 --> 00:35.436
You don't know
what that means?

00:35.469 --> 00:36.770
I thought you were
The Guy.

00:36.804 --> 00:38.739
(Speaking in Swedish)

00:38.772 --> 00:40.841
I was told it's one of
the most popular phrases.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.110
Now I know
what that means,

00:42.143 --> 00:43.777
that's... I think
that was something

00:43.811 --> 00:46.347
that the tourists... say

00:46.380 --> 00:47.948
when there's,
like, an emergency
or something.

00:47.981 --> 00:49.483
Oh, well that's
good to know.

00:49.517 --> 00:50.518
Yeah, I know that.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.953
(Speaking in Swedish)
Yeah.

00:52.986 --> 00:54.688
Shall we do this?
Let's do it, yes.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.090
I want to do
everything, man.

00:56.124 --> 00:57.325
I've got
the whole day free.

00:57.358 --> 00:59.059
I want to go to
the Vasa Museum,

00:59.093 --> 01:00.761
I want to go to
the ABBA Museum,

01:00.794 --> 01:02.363
I want to get me
some of them sweet-ass

01:02.396 --> 01:04.465
Björn Borg underpants,
the tight ones,

01:04.498 --> 01:05.933
if you know
where they are?

01:05.966 --> 01:07.568
Yeah, okay, wow.
You've really done
your research.

01:07.601 --> 01:10.003
I'm psyched!
Yeah, Jack Black
in Stockholm.

01:10.037 --> 01:12.106
Let's do it,
we get the whole day.
Let's do this! (Laughing)

01:12.140 --> 01:13.441
I just thought we
would start with...

01:13.474 --> 01:14.508
Ow...

01:14.542 --> 01:16.310
Hey... what?
What's....

01:20.281 --> 01:22.350
Is this a joke?

01:22.383 --> 01:24.652
He just got kidnapped.
Did anyone see that?

01:26.720 --> 01:28.189
(Speaking in Swedish)

01:29.857 --> 01:32.025
Can anyone hear me? Am I...

01:32.059 --> 01:33.026
Is there a roll on it?

01:36.430 --> 01:39.400
(Shouting)

01:39.433 --> 01:41.802
Bruce:
Ah!

01:41.835 --> 01:42.836
Why?

01:42.870 --> 01:45.706
* We're not living in America

01:45.739 --> 01:49.243
* But we're not sorry

01:49.277 --> 01:50.978
* I knew there was something

01:51.011 --> 01:53.046
* That we never had

01:53.080 --> 01:55.983
* We don't worry

01:56.016 --> 01:59.320
* No, we're not
living in America *

01:59.353 --> 02:03.090
* But we're not sorry, no

02:03.123 --> 02:06.627
* We don't care
about the world today *

02:06.660 --> 02:09.363
* We're not sorry

02:09.397 --> 02:10.998
* For you

02:12.533 --> 02:16.670
* For my baby, baby,
baby, baby *

02:16.704 --> 02:17.671
* Aahh

02:21.074 --> 02:22.410
Is this a ransom thing?

02:22.443 --> 02:24.345
Because I don't have any money!
I've nothing!

02:24.378 --> 02:26.247
There's no one that's going
to be looking for me at all

02:26.280 --> 02:28.616
if it's ransom.
You picked the wrong guy!
(Car engine stops)

02:30.451 --> 02:32.019
No, no, no, please don't.

02:32.052 --> 02:34.087
Please don't, I'll do anything.

02:34.121 --> 02:36.190
All:
Surprise!

02:36.224 --> 02:38.426
Bachelor party-y-y-y!

02:38.459 --> 02:40.828
No, no! Not cool!

02:40.861 --> 02:42.263
Not cool
at all, I mean...

02:42.296 --> 02:44.998
What the hell, you guys?

02:45.032 --> 02:46.033
Hassan...

02:46.066 --> 02:47.100
Hello, Bruce.

02:47.134 --> 02:49.570
Hi.

02:49.603 --> 02:50.938
And... you?

02:50.971 --> 02:52.072
I'm sorry,
who are you?

02:52.105 --> 02:54.242
I'm Karl,
Sofia's boyfriend.

02:54.275 --> 02:56.344
Right...

02:56.377 --> 02:57.445
Who's Sofia?

02:57.478 --> 03:00.648
My girlfriend.
Emma's colleague.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.716
Right, yes.

03:02.750 --> 03:03.951
Thanks for coming.

03:03.984 --> 03:04.985
He has a car.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.455
Okay, that makes sense.

03:07.488 --> 03:09.323
I guess
everyone's here.

03:09.357 --> 03:10.558
Hassan, I don't...

03:10.591 --> 03:12.493
Sorry, I don't get it,
why are you here?

03:12.526 --> 03:14.362
I have my reasons.

03:14.395 --> 03:17.164
Okay. Can someone help me
out of this car?

03:17.197 --> 03:19.099
(Grunting)

03:19.132 --> 03:21.502
God, whoo!

03:21.535 --> 03:23.271
Oh man, that was...

03:23.304 --> 03:25.506
that was the worst,
I thought I was going
to die in there.

03:25.539 --> 03:26.574
Yea-a-a-h, whoo!

03:26.607 --> 03:29.176
(Cheering)

03:29.209 --> 03:30.378
That's not...
that's not a good thing,

03:30.411 --> 03:31.512
I almost peed myself.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.981
(Cheering)

03:34.014 --> 03:36.817
Welcome to your first
Swedish Bachelor party.

03:36.850 --> 03:38.051
This is how we do it.

03:38.085 --> 03:39.587
You should have checked
with me first, okay?

03:39.620 --> 03:41.154
What if I had something
important to do?

03:41.188 --> 03:42.723
Did you have something
important to do?

03:42.756 --> 03:43.791
Yes, actually I did.

03:43.824 --> 03:46.360
Yea-a-a-ahh!

03:46.394 --> 03:48.128
(Cheering)

03:50.063 --> 03:51.231
Listen, Hassan.

03:51.265 --> 03:53.033
It's been
a while, and...

03:53.066 --> 03:55.403
I'm sorry I lied to you
about being Canadian.

03:55.436 --> 03:56.870
You know, that was...
that was wrong.

03:56.904 --> 04:00.240
Yes. That was wrong,
Bruce.

04:00.274 --> 04:02.310
That was wrong.

04:02.343 --> 04:03.744
Right.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.346
(Mixed chatter in Swedish)

04:07.080 --> 04:08.449
Did you send the email?
Yeah, sure, sure!

04:08.482 --> 04:10.017
I wrote that she had
to come here immediately

04:10.050 --> 04:11.319
so it's fine.
Perfect!

04:11.352 --> 04:12.753
When she comes, tell
her she's getting fired,

04:12.786 --> 04:14.788
she'll be all "Whaaaat?"

04:14.822 --> 04:18.158
And then we come in
and go like,
"wohoo möhippa"!

04:18.191 --> 04:19.360
A what? A what?

04:19.393 --> 04:20.594
"Möhippa",
it's the Swedish word

04:20.628 --> 04:22.129
for bachelorette party.
Möhippa?

04:22.162 --> 04:24.197
Yeah, möhippa.
You can handle this now?

04:24.231 --> 04:25.799
Yeah, sure.
You can all relax,

04:25.833 --> 04:27.901
I took, ahem,
drama classes
in school, so...

04:27.935 --> 04:29.403
Oh, you did?
Yeah.

04:29.437 --> 04:31.238
What's the
password?
The what?

04:31.271 --> 04:32.540
Password!
That's a good idea.

04:32.573 --> 04:33.974
We'll be listening
through the door,

04:34.007 --> 04:36.043
so when we hear
you say it, that's
when we come in!

04:36.076 --> 04:37.144
Oh, oh, password!

04:37.177 --> 04:38.612
Uh... the... the...
it will be...

04:38.646 --> 04:40.213
the password is, uh...

04:40.247 --> 04:41.248
Come on, something!

04:41.281 --> 04:42.950
(Speaking in Swedish)

04:42.983 --> 04:44.952
She's coming!
She's coming!

04:46.854 --> 04:49.222
And action!

04:49.256 --> 04:52.560
So, uh, can you tell me
a little bit about what, uh,

04:52.593 --> 04:54.395
what went down here.
What happened?

04:54.428 --> 04:56.029
Okay. From right
over there,

04:56.063 --> 04:57.931
there's like three
or four masked men,

04:57.965 --> 05:00.033
all in black,
and they just grabbed him,

05:00.067 --> 05:01.569
and they just
took him out to the car,

05:01.602 --> 05:03.504
slammed the door,
and they drove off.

05:03.537 --> 05:04.638
Boom! It was so fast.

05:04.672 --> 05:07.508
So you just...
you stood there and...

05:07.541 --> 05:10.944
didn't do anything
about it, or...?

05:10.978 --> 05:12.713
Well, I was
in shock,

05:12.746 --> 05:15.616
and I didn't do nothing,
I yelled out to everyone:

05:15.649 --> 05:17.585
(Speaking in Swedish)

05:17.618 --> 05:19.453
Okay, okay.
First things first.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.054
We do like this now.

05:21.088 --> 05:22.590
We take a little selfie
here you and I.

05:22.623 --> 05:24.024
What?
Yes.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.526
Put on
the happy face here.
(Camera shutter clicking)

05:25.559 --> 05:26.960
He was kidnapped!
Yes.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.328
You understand?

05:28.362 --> 05:29.863
So, take it easy now.
(Sighing)

05:29.897 --> 05:31.965
Uhm, do you know
the name of this person?

05:31.999 --> 05:34.435
Uh, I... yeah I don't
remember his name,

05:34.468 --> 05:36.670
he was... The Guy?

05:36.704 --> 05:38.205
Hm, okay, I know
that he's a guy

05:38.238 --> 05:40.107
but what is the name
of the guy?

05:40.140 --> 05:42.376
No, I mean,
he's The Guy!
Of Stockholm!

05:42.410 --> 05:43.977
I don't remember
his name, it was,

05:44.011 --> 05:45.513
you know...
What did he
look like?

05:45.546 --> 05:48.649
Bra, that's a...
that's a good
question, yes?

05:48.682 --> 05:51.752
Um... Just like
a normal face,

05:51.785 --> 05:53.521
very plain,

05:53.554 --> 05:55.088
total nothing.

05:55.122 --> 05:56.323
Okay.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.792
So I think
we do like this.
You, Janne?

05:58.826 --> 06:01.862
We take a picture
with you and
Jack Black there.

06:01.895 --> 06:03.431
Are you kidding me?
Okay, yes!

06:03.464 --> 06:04.698
There you are.
He was kidnapped.

06:04.732 --> 06:06.166
That's a nice face.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.001
He was kidna-a-a-apped!

06:09.603 --> 06:10.971
Okay, whoo.
Whoo!

06:11.004 --> 06:12.840
Let's do this, I guess.
Bachelor party, all right?

06:12.873 --> 06:15.142
This could be fun.
I have a few ideas
of things we can do.

06:15.175 --> 06:17.244
No, no, no, no.
You have no say in it.

06:17.277 --> 06:19.312
We have everything
planned out.

06:19.346 --> 06:21.749
It's going to be
a nightmare.

06:21.782 --> 06:24.017
Did you hear about
the guy they rolled
up in a carpet

06:24.051 --> 06:25.886
and left him upside-down
till he died?

06:25.919 --> 06:27.821
That sounds
absolutely horrible.

06:27.855 --> 06:30.257
Yeah, maybe
you're right.

06:30.290 --> 06:31.324
Hey, hey, Bengt,

06:31.358 --> 06:32.526
forget about
the carpet,

06:32.560 --> 06:34.428
we'll just do
safe torture.

06:34.462 --> 06:35.796
Wait, I don't want
any tor...

06:35.829 --> 06:37.030
What if... what if
I just say no?

06:37.064 --> 06:39.467
You can't, it's illegal
to say no.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.235
This is going
to be the worst day
of your life.

06:42.269 --> 06:44.505
We're going to
make you suffer.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.206
That's why I'm here!

06:46.239 --> 06:49.443
They promised me that
you will suffer-r-r-r!

06:49.477 --> 06:50.878
(Cheering)

06:50.911 --> 06:56.850
(Music)

06:56.884 --> 06:59.252
(Sighing)

07:03.957 --> 07:06.927
(Speaking in Swedish)

08:24.838 --> 08:27.708
Oh, this is so fun,
what are they saying?

08:27.741 --> 08:32.913
It's hard to translate,
it's mostly Swedish,
uh, sayings.

08:32.946 --> 08:35.382
Ah, cool.
Yeah...

09:07.180 --> 09:08.181
Password.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.216
Password?

09:09.249 --> 09:10.250
Password!
Password?

09:10.283 --> 09:13.053
(Shouting)
Password!

09:13.086 --> 09:14.154
Surprise.

09:14.187 --> 09:15.255
Various:
Surprise.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.857
Möhippa!

09:16.890 --> 09:18.091
Yay!

09:18.125 --> 09:19.292
Hey!

09:19.326 --> 09:20.694
Good job!
Olof:
Yeah, did you hear it?

09:20.728 --> 09:21.862
Diane:
Yeah, it was really good.

09:21.895 --> 09:22.896
Olof:
Pretty good wasn't it, yeah?

09:22.930 --> 09:24.064
Diane:
Really good.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.071
Olof:
Hippa.
Yeah...

09:33.907 --> 09:36.109
One for Bengt,
one for Bruce.

09:36.143 --> 09:37.878
Thanks.
One for...

09:37.911 --> 09:38.912
Karl. Karl.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.480
Yeah, Karl, right.

09:40.513 --> 09:43.416
So, this is going to be
the craziest party ever.

09:43.450 --> 09:45.018
It's going to be legendary.

09:45.052 --> 09:47.254
We'll be telling
our grandkids about this.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.522
The day that Bruce
almost died.

09:49.556 --> 09:51.091
Oh.
(Mixed laughter)

09:51.124 --> 09:52.125
Hey, look at this,

09:52.159 --> 09:53.827
a tattoo machine.

09:53.861 --> 09:55.262
Don't you need
a license for that?

09:55.295 --> 09:57.998
In Sweden? No.

09:58.031 --> 09:59.099
Okay Bruce,

09:59.132 --> 10:00.801
you want to get shot
by paintballs

10:00.834 --> 10:04.471
or you want to wear
a pink rabbit costume?

10:04.504 --> 10:06.539
Hmm, neither.

10:06.573 --> 10:08.842
Okay. Okay.

10:08.876 --> 10:11.745
(Dramatic string music)

10:11.779 --> 10:14.247
(Mixed shouts)

10:14.281 --> 10:17.384
(Paintball gunshots)

10:17.417 --> 10:24.624
(Music)

10:24.658 --> 10:25.592
(Paintball impact)

10:26.727 --> 10:33.533
(Music)

10:33.566 --> 10:37.504
(Roar of helicopter)

10:37.537 --> 10:43.911
(Music)

10:47.614 --> 10:57.958
(Soft piano music)

10:57.991 --> 10:59.492
Diane:
Möhippa whoo!

10:59.526 --> 11:00.928
Möhippa hey!

11:00.961 --> 11:02.629
Möhippa whoo!

11:02.662 --> 11:04.564
Emma:
Hey, what's this?

11:04.597 --> 11:06.133
This is a box
of questions

11:06.166 --> 11:07.835
I had everyone
put together.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.102
Oh, wow!

11:09.136 --> 11:10.637
Mystery questions.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.005
How exciting.

11:12.039 --> 11:13.774
Okay. "Be honest.

11:13.807 --> 11:17.778
Name one thing that you hate
about every person here."

11:17.811 --> 11:20.714
I... I might have
covered that one
already?

11:20.748 --> 11:22.415
Oh, you have?
Mm. Yeah.

11:22.449 --> 11:25.085
So,
next question?
Yeah.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.154
"Which one of your friends
is most likely

11:27.187 --> 11:28.555
to sleep with
a friend's boyfr..."

11:28.588 --> 11:31.825
You know what?
This is just a silly game.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.761
So, möhippa!

11:33.794 --> 11:36.529
Möhippa! Mohippa! Möhippa!

11:36.563 --> 11:38.799
Möhippa! Mohippa! Möhippa!

11:38.832 --> 11:40.533
Yes, we say cheese.
(Camera shutter clicking)

11:40.567 --> 11:42.435
That's great!

11:42.469 --> 11:43.670
Thank you very much!

11:43.703 --> 11:45.038
Uh, is there
any more people

11:45.072 --> 11:47.841
who want to be
picture taken here?

11:47.875 --> 11:49.542
Yes, you over
there too?

11:49.576 --> 11:50.543
Oh, my god.

11:53.446 --> 11:56.316
(Speaking in Swedish)

12:17.404 --> 12:19.606
Okay dolls,
here you go. Tequila!

12:19.639 --> 12:21.708
Emma:
Whoo-hoo!

12:23.476 --> 12:25.512
(Chuckling)

12:25.545 --> 12:26.579
Sofia:
There you go.

12:26.613 --> 12:29.349
Oh, hello old friend.

12:29.382 --> 12:31.318
Yeah, just one more.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.588
You know what? I'm sorry.

12:35.622 --> 12:37.490
I... I love you guys.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.259
You're the best.

12:39.292 --> 12:40.593
I've been
stressed lately

12:40.627 --> 12:42.695
and I've said
some stupid stuff.

12:42.729 --> 12:44.464
Okay? Sorry.

12:44.497 --> 12:46.566
Let's just
don't think about that

12:46.599 --> 12:49.436
and make this the best
bachelorette party ever.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.771
Everyone:
Cheers! Cheers. Cheers.

12:51.805 --> 12:53.206
(Laughing)

12:54.374 --> 12:56.609
Diane:
Ah! Good.

12:56.643 --> 12:59.746
And I'm sorry I said
Jenny made out with
Anna's boyfriend.

12:59.779 --> 13:00.780
That was just...

13:00.814 --> 13:02.349
What?

13:02.382 --> 13:03.383
Hm?

13:03.416 --> 13:04.484
It was Mattias?

13:04.517 --> 13:07.720
You... You made out
with Mattias?

13:07.754 --> 13:10.523
Oh.

13:10.557 --> 13:13.060
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

13:13.093 --> 13:14.527
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!

13:14.561 --> 13:17.430
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!
Woman: Girls, stop!

13:17.464 --> 13:19.032
(Sighing)
All right guys, I get it,

13:19.066 --> 13:21.134
Okay? I know
where this is going.

13:21.168 --> 13:22.669
Okay, I'm not an idiot.

13:22.702 --> 13:25.305
Just for the record,
I don't like lap dances, okay?

13:25.338 --> 13:27.507
The stripper thing
kind of freaks me out, so...

13:27.540 --> 13:30.110
I mean, I'll do it if
you guys insist, but...

13:30.143 --> 13:32.079
Let's just get it
over with quick.

13:32.112 --> 13:34.181
There's nothing quick
about this, Bruce.

13:34.214 --> 13:35.715
What?
Gustaf:
Now, good luck.

13:35.748 --> 13:37.951
Can we just...
go get some beers
or something, or...

13:37.985 --> 13:39.519
No, this is fun.

13:39.552 --> 13:40.487
This is tradition.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.925
Now it's time
for your fight.

13:44.958 --> 13:45.859
Fight? What fight?

13:47.027 --> 13:47.928
(Bell clanging)

13:49.496 --> 13:56.904
(Music)

13:56.937 --> 13:59.006
Everyone is
so happy again.

13:59.039 --> 14:01.074
(Laughter)
It makes me glad.

14:01.108 --> 14:02.842
(Laughing)

14:02.876 --> 14:04.211
You know what
I'm thinking?

14:04.244 --> 14:07.347
You know, everything
is Olof's fault.
Ooh...

14:07.380 --> 14:08.715
I mean, if it wasn't
for Olof,

14:08.748 --> 14:11.151
we wouldn't have had
all this fighting,

14:11.184 --> 14:12.852
so it's not
my fault, right?

14:12.886 --> 14:13.921
Various:
No.

14:13.954 --> 14:16.089
Waiter:
This one is also
from Mexico.

14:16.123 --> 14:18.959
It has a bit more
distinct flavour.

14:18.992 --> 14:20.027
Emma:
Mmm!

14:20.060 --> 14:21.728
A bit more on
the flower side.

14:21.761 --> 14:23.997
Diane:
Everybody?
You know what?

14:24.031 --> 14:25.966
Emma is right.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.000
Thank you.

14:27.034 --> 14:30.270
Olof is a dick.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.139
(Laughing)

14:32.172 --> 14:33.740
You know
what we should do?

14:33.773 --> 14:35.808
I think we should
go back to the office

14:35.842 --> 14:37.210
and do a prank
in his room.

14:37.244 --> 14:38.245
Yes!

14:38.278 --> 14:39.312
Everyone:
Yeah!

14:39.346 --> 14:41.481
In his room,
let's go! Come on!

14:41.514 --> 14:44.551
(Music)

14:44.584 --> 14:47.487
(Speaking in Swedish)

14:53.927 --> 14:56.129
You didn't think
I was so good, huh?

14:56.163 --> 14:57.464
Hey, guys.
Bengt:
Hello, Chuck.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.532
Hey, Chuck!
Chuck:
Hey man!

14:59.566 --> 15:01.201
What are you
doing here?
It's your stag party.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.735
Oh my God,
I can't believe
you came!

15:02.769 --> 15:04.437
Of course I did!

15:04.471 --> 15:05.872
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Get into the game!
Oh, I'm sorry man.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.274
Fight!
I got it, yeah!

15:07.307 --> 15:09.676
(Grunts)

15:09.709 --> 15:12.679
(Speaking in Swedish)

15:14.081 --> 15:15.015
Ding!

15:18.418 --> 15:19.586
Damn!

15:19.619 --> 15:20.653
Good, right?
Yeah, yeah,

15:20.687 --> 15:21.955
you killed him,
you killed him.

15:21.989 --> 15:23.756
Okay, well,
take care then.

15:23.790 --> 15:24.992
Oh, you're leaving?

15:25.025 --> 15:26.893
Oh yeah, they only paid
for the one hour so...

15:26.926 --> 15:28.295
I'm out! Okay?

15:28.328 --> 15:29.662
Don't block
with your face.

15:29.696 --> 15:30.897
See you guys!
Karl: Bye, Chuck.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.132
Chuck:
Take care!

15:32.165 --> 15:35.102
(Speaking in Swedish)

15:38.405 --> 15:40.207
He's not that tough,
I think I can take him.

15:40.240 --> 15:43.010
You got to eat lightning
and you got to crap thunder.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.077
Crap thunder?

15:44.111 --> 15:45.612
Well, it's from "Rocky".

15:45.645 --> 15:46.913
Okay.
Yeah.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.448
Out of all the
"Rocky" quotes
you chose that one?

15:48.481 --> 15:50.017
Yeah.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.952
(Speaking in Swedish)

15:56.456 --> 15:57.457
Ding!

15:57.490 --> 16:00.960
(Music)

16:00.994 --> 16:02.329
Oooh...

16:02.362 --> 16:03.863
Oowah, oowah...

16:03.896 --> 16:05.132
(Laughing)

16:05.165 --> 16:06.499
Move like a butterfly.

16:06.533 --> 16:08.235
Sting...
(Thud)

16:08.268 --> 16:11.271
All:
(Triumphant shouts)

16:13.673 --> 16:16.376
Bruce, have some
more pizza.

16:16.409 --> 16:17.810
Oh, I can't eat, man.

16:17.844 --> 16:19.346
I think I have
a concussion.

16:19.379 --> 16:20.980
Here, try this.

16:22.349 --> 16:24.917
Excuse me,
is there only one pizza?

16:24.951 --> 16:26.653
We had to make
some budget cuts

16:26.686 --> 16:28.221
because of
the entertainment.

16:28.255 --> 16:29.256
Entertainment?

16:29.289 --> 16:30.490
Yeah.

16:30.523 --> 16:33.260
I booked some
entertainment.

16:33.293 --> 16:36.396
So, there is no more
suffering for Bruce?

16:36.429 --> 16:39.299
No! Now is just party,
party, party!

16:39.332 --> 16:42.302
Okay. Goodbye.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.270
Bye...

16:44.537 --> 16:45.938
Be good, Hassan.

16:48.508 --> 16:49.876
Maybe we could put post-it notes

16:49.909 --> 16:52.011
on all his stuff!

16:52.045 --> 16:54.947
Or we could rearrange
the furniture.

16:54.981 --> 16:58.785
Or we can put his papers
in the wrong order.

16:58.818 --> 17:01.121
Aaaaaahhhhhhh!

17:01.154 --> 17:02.889
(Crash, clatter)

17:04.257 --> 17:06.793
(Tattoo pen buzzing)

17:06.826 --> 17:08.695
(Slap)
Next!

17:08.728 --> 17:10.863
Gustaf:
Hey Bruce, look!

17:10.897 --> 17:12.099
(Drunken giggling)

17:14.301 --> 17:16.669
I don't get it, "SFIA"?
What does that mean?

17:18.471 --> 17:20.507
Oh! "Sofia"!

17:20.540 --> 17:21.541
That's...
that's great, man.

17:21.574 --> 17:22.609
She's going
to love that.

17:22.642 --> 17:23.643
Yeah?
Yeah.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.712
(Laughing and snorting)

17:25.745 --> 17:27.447
Hey man, when is
the entertainment coming?

17:27.480 --> 17:29.216
Man, it's not my thing.

17:29.249 --> 17:31.118
We both know that,
but I just wanted
to make sure

17:31.151 --> 17:32.852
I didn't, you know,
it's getting late and...

17:32.885 --> 17:34.821
Soon, Bruce.
Okay.

17:34.854 --> 17:36.156
(Knocking on door)
Woman: (Muffled)
Hello?

17:36.189 --> 17:38.725
Aah! Speak of the devil.

17:38.758 --> 17:39.959
(Door slams open)

17:41.228 --> 17:43.096
(Speaking in Swedish)

17:43.130 --> 17:44.831
Sorry, you're going to have
to do this in English.

17:44.864 --> 17:46.733
We've received
complaints.
Right.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.101
From the neighbours.
Mm-hmm.

17:48.135 --> 17:49.702
The music is too loud.

17:49.736 --> 17:50.803
Right, yeah.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.639
You guys are good.

17:52.672 --> 17:54.241
Hey, nice try, guys!

17:54.274 --> 17:55.942
You think I'm going
to fall for the old
police officer thing?

17:55.975 --> 17:57.610
(Chuckling)
Classic.

17:57.644 --> 18:00.480
You see, now,
this is not really
my thing, okay?

18:00.513 --> 18:02.048
Look at that gun,
it almost looks real.

18:04.317 --> 18:08.121
Oh, wow! You guys
are really taking this
all the way, huh?

18:08.155 --> 18:09.989
All right!
Turn the music down

18:10.022 --> 18:11.824
or everybody
is coming with us.
It's not really my thing.

18:11.858 --> 18:12.892
Okay?

18:12.925 --> 18:17.664
(Music)

18:17.697 --> 18:20.800
Who's the one
that's getting married?

18:20.833 --> 18:22.735
Cool, the
entertainment
is here!

18:24.271 --> 18:33.480
(Music)

18:33.513 --> 18:35.748
I'm sorry for making fun
of you guys.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.250
I honestly thought
this was a joke.

18:37.284 --> 18:40.086
I thought this was
part of the whole...
bachelor party thing.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.454
I mean, you guys with...

18:41.488 --> 18:42.855
Those uniforms
are ridiculous.

18:42.889 --> 18:43.890
What?

18:43.923 --> 18:45.425
Your uniforms,
it's misspelled.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.894
And all that,
I thought that
it was just...

18:47.927 --> 18:50.330
Excuse...
Take it a little
easy now, okay?

18:50.363 --> 18:51.398
(Burping)

18:51.431 --> 18:52.599
(Speaking in Swedish)

18:52.632 --> 18:53.766
Stop raping.
Yeah.

18:53.800 --> 18:54.801
No more raping.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.002
I'm sorry, I didn't...

18:56.035 --> 18:57.637
Please, can you be
a little quiet now?

18:57.670 --> 18:59.206
Uh-huh.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.240
Just... just
so you know,

19:00.273 --> 19:01.274
you guys didn't
read me my rights.

19:01.308 --> 19:02.475
That's not a big
thing for me...

19:02.509 --> 19:03.876
Ok, listen up, no no.

19:03.910 --> 19:06.145
In Sweden we don't have,
eh... rights.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.447
No rights in Sweden, no.
No.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.515
No, okay.

19:08.548 --> 19:10.817
It's your
American TV, film,

19:10.850 --> 19:12.519
so... Not here, okay?

19:12.552 --> 19:14.587
Okay, it's been a long day,
I'll be honest.

19:14.621 --> 19:17.624
(Speaking in Swedish)

19:44.384 --> 19:46.286
(Knocking on door)
Oh, yeah.

19:46.319 --> 19:47.987
I think there's someone
here to see you now.

19:48.020 --> 19:51.224
So it's... might be your
lucky day, as they say.

19:51.258 --> 19:53.460
(Speaking in Swedish)

19:53.493 --> 19:56.696
I'm your attorney.
Can you please leave the room?

19:56.729 --> 19:58.965
Okay. We'll be out here
if you need me.

20:00.367 --> 20:02.134
(Door closing)
I'm so happy
to see you.

20:02.168 --> 20:04.003
You got to get me
out of here.
Of course.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.072
We just have
to go through some
formalities first.

20:06.105 --> 20:07.507
Yeah, anything you want.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.542
Is it okay if
I record this?

20:09.576 --> 20:11.278
Yeah, of course.
Get it all on tape.

20:11.311 --> 20:12.245
I've got nothing
to hide.

20:13.913 --> 20:15.282
(Dance music)

20:15.315 --> 20:17.350
Oh no...
no, no, no, no!

20:17.384 --> 20:19.619
I don't need...
no, this is...
I really don't...

20:19.652 --> 20:22.589
this is not my thing.
It's, can we not...

20:22.622 --> 20:24.824
Please stop,
I don't...

20:24.857 --> 20:26.526
Oh well, hm.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.261
No, but yeah,
uh... no.

20:31.364 --> 20:34.334
(Speaking in Swedish)

21:00.960 --> 21:04.797
(Cellphone ringing)

21:04.831 --> 21:06.699
(Cellphone ringing)

21:06.733 --> 21:08.234
(Loud thud)

21:08.267 --> 21:10.737
Ugh!
(Grunting)

21:10.770 --> 21:13.706
(Speaking in Swedish)

21:35.227 --> 21:36.162
(Grunting)

21:45.472 --> 21:47.707
(Sighing)

21:47.740 --> 21:49.108
So, how did it go
for you?

21:49.141 --> 21:53.045
Uh, great, good,
fine. You?

21:53.079 --> 21:55.014
Good. Yeah, it was good.

21:55.047 --> 21:56.048
It was great.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.852
O-o-oh.

21:59.886 --> 22:01.588
How did it go
with Jack Black?

22:01.621 --> 22:02.555
Jack Black!

22:03.723 --> 22:05.091
Hello, Sherry.

22:05.124 --> 22:06.826
Yeah, get me
on the next flight out.

22:06.859 --> 22:08.127
I don't care where.
Anywhere.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.463
This is the most dangerous
place in the world.

22:10.497 --> 22:12.264
Yeah, they kidnap people
willy-nilly.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.334
Tell my wife I love her.

22:17.269 --> 22:20.206
