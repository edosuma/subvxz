00:35.827 --> 00:42.292


01:12.947 --> 01:14.157
Pour it out.

01:15.950 --> 01:16.868
Mmm.

01:16.951 --> 01:17.827
Mmm.

01:17.911 --> 01:18.953
Mmm.

01:19.037 --> 01:23.166
I knew that getting
Miss Frances's send-off done right

01:23.249 --> 01:26.294
was gonna be rewarding.
I didn't expect it to be exhausting.

01:26.377 --> 01:28.254
Well, emotions can drain you.

01:28.755 --> 01:32.759
Yeah. Is it emotion about the funeral
or that Ryan is back?

01:32.842 --> 01:35.845
-And thank you, Dana Sue.
-Have you talked to him?

01:35.929 --> 01:37.055
Not really.

01:37.138 --> 01:40.141
He came by,
but I was on my way out to meet Erik.

01:42.352 --> 01:44.312
Brief. Polite.

01:44.854 --> 01:46.356
Capital A awkward.

01:46.439 --> 01:49.692
Why awkward? He had his chance,
and he blew his chance.

01:49.776 --> 01:52.695
You do not owe him
an explanation or a second thought.

01:52.779 --> 01:55.406
You and Erik are happy,
and that is all that matters.

01:56.324 --> 01:57.700
Hmm, I don't know.

01:59.744 --> 02:03.623
Look, you and Ryan
were together for a long time

02:03.706 --> 02:05.667
and loved each other deeply.

02:05.750 --> 02:08.002
And no disrespect to his aunt,

02:08.086 --> 02:10.922
but you were probably
the reason he came home,

02:11.005 --> 02:13.883
and you might have
other things to talk about.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.471
Helen, what are you thinkin'?

02:19.055 --> 02:23.184
I'm just pondering if Miss Shiny-New-Love
and Miss One-Last-Chance

02:23.268 --> 02:26.271
are doing well in their <i>own</i> relationships.

02:29.732 --> 02:31.693
Dana S-- Come on, Dana Sue.

02:31.776 --> 02:32.819
Dana Sue!

02:34.112 --> 02:36.531
-Dana Sue, I didn't mean to be hurtful.
-It's fine.

02:36.614 --> 02:39.742
Dana Sue, come here.
No, no. Hey, I'm sorry.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.536
-I know. I know.
-I'm sorry.

02:41.619 --> 02:43.705
-I know.
-How's counseling?

02:43.788 --> 02:45.915
Uh, it's helping, <i>I</i> think.

02:46.749 --> 02:48.877
Even though June
doesn't always agree with me,

02:48.960 --> 02:50.253
which is super annoying.

02:52.338 --> 02:55.341
But, uh, two sides to every story, right?

02:56.384 --> 02:59.429
Problem is, I have spent such a long time

02:59.512 --> 03:01.764
thinking those were the side
that he was wrong

03:01.848 --> 03:05.977
and the side that I was right,
but, uh, I made mistakes too.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.440
-So many.
-But you didn't cheat on him.

03:10.523 --> 03:11.441
Mmm.

03:11.524 --> 03:13.610
No, but I hurt him.

03:17.363 --> 03:18.281
And

03:19.199 --> 03:23.786
June is helping me see
that I don't get to assign points

03:23.870 --> 03:28.958
to what he did
and what I did and then decide who won.

03:30.627 --> 03:31.461
But,

03:32.712 --> 03:35.924
after wading through all of the hurt,

03:36.716 --> 03:38.468
I'm starting to see the hope.

03:40.136 --> 03:42.472
-And hope moves us forward.
-Yeah.

03:42.972 --> 03:44.682
So, good for you, Dana Sue.

03:44.766 --> 03:45.767
Thanks.

03:47.352 --> 03:48.811
What about you, Maddie?

03:48.895 --> 03:51.022
-What?
-How are you and Cal doing?

03:51.105 --> 03:53.316
Especially with Mary Vaughn
breathing down your neck.

03:53.399 --> 03:55.985
Well, we have gone through everything
with a fine-tooth comb,

03:56.069 --> 03:59.113
and aside from one minor tussle
with Henry Hutchinson

03:59.197 --> 04:00.615
over a parking spot at the gym…

04:00.698 --> 04:03.076
-…Cal has been a model citizen.

04:03.159 --> 04:04.702
So it's all about Jackson.

04:04.786 --> 04:08.206
-Yeah, and he's fine with that.
-Then we're moving on to victory.

04:08.289 --> 04:11.084
And should be narrowing down
the list of candidates for mayor.

04:11.167 --> 04:13.711
Can we please put that
on the to-do list for tomorrow?

04:13.795 --> 04:15.713
-Hmm.
-Let's just relax tonight.

04:15.797 --> 04:19.801
Okay. Well, then, to the next mayor
of Serenity, whoever they may be.

04:19.884 --> 04:21.052
Yes! Okay.

04:21.135 --> 04:22.553
-Yes!

04:23.930 --> 04:26.015
Sorry I missed Noreen and Rebecca.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.267
They won't be long.

04:28.184 --> 04:30.812
Noreen likes to take the baby on a stroll
through the neighborhood

04:30.895 --> 04:32.105
before she turns in.

04:32.188 --> 04:34.816
-Hmm.
-She says they both sleep better.

04:36.192 --> 04:38.945
If they sleep at all
at Rebecca's age, that's a wonder.

04:42.532 --> 04:43.783
Before they get back…

04:45.868 --> 04:47.412
I haven't told anyone,

04:47.495 --> 04:48.955
but I wanna tell you.

04:51.040 --> 04:52.917
You're such a good friend, and…

04:56.045 --> 04:58.464
Hey, you can always tell me anything.

04:59.924 --> 05:02.302
You don't have to say a word
until you're ready.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.725
I met my biological dad.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.894
Bill Townsend.

05:13.479 --> 05:15.648
Yeah. You could've knocked me over too.

05:17.525 --> 05:19.235
Of all the men in this town…

05:21.946 --> 05:23.031
How do you feel?

05:23.531 --> 05:24.991
Wish I'd been right about you.

05:27.118 --> 05:27.952
Hey.

05:30.246 --> 05:31.831
It's good to finally know.

05:33.249 --> 05:36.169
But for it to be a man
that's caused such deep pain

05:36.252 --> 05:38.379
to people that I really care about…

05:40.131 --> 05:42.300
I'm still trying
to wrap my heart around it.

05:46.220 --> 05:49.223
-Have you told Noreen?
-She's dealing with so much right now.

05:49.307 --> 05:52.977
It can wait
till I've come to terms with it myself.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.271
Hey, I want you to listen to me.

05:57.148 --> 05:58.191
This answer,

05:58.983 --> 06:01.527
it doesn't change a thing
about who you are as a man.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.404
It's just a piece of data.

06:03.488 --> 06:05.156
A fragment of fate.

06:05.239 --> 06:07.533
What you do with it is up to you.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.124
So how's Ty today?

06:15.625 --> 06:16.751
He's still struggling.

06:18.419 --> 06:19.837
My heart breaks for him.

06:21.214 --> 06:24.217
But I don't think he's ready
for Mom's thoughts on plan B.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.221
But that's, um…

06:30.973 --> 06:32.850
It's not why I asked you to come by.

06:35.144 --> 06:36.104
3:00 a.m. thought.

06:36.813 --> 06:41.401
This whole Mary Vaughn leverage thing.

06:41.484 --> 06:43.778
Might there be something that you did

06:43.861 --> 06:46.114
before you got here
that she found out about?

07:05.049 --> 07:05.883
Hey.

07:06.843 --> 07:07.802
I love you.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.138
You love me.

07:11.139 --> 07:12.140
Trust me.

07:14.851 --> 07:15.977
Okay.

07:17.812 --> 07:21.023
I'm always telling your boys
the best way forward is through, so…

07:22.567 --> 07:23.901
After my accident,

07:25.069 --> 07:27.447
when I realized I wasn't gonna play again,

07:29.323 --> 07:30.241
it got dark.

07:32.994 --> 07:35.246
<i>I </i>got dark.

07:37.457 --> 07:38.458
Destructive.

07:40.168 --> 07:42.587
Johnny and Jodie dragged me to a program.

07:46.716 --> 07:47.842
Anger management.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.388
And I owe them for the rest of my life.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.310
And I'm on top of it now. Swear to God.

08:00.271 --> 08:02.940
I don't know.
Maybe Mary Vaughn found out about that.

08:04.692 --> 08:06.694
Why didn't you tell me?

08:09.530 --> 08:10.615
'Cause it's hard.

08:10.698 --> 08:14.160
I packed it all away, just like I did
with all the problems with Victoria.

08:15.578 --> 08:18.206
You move on.
Leave all that crap in the past.

08:18.289 --> 08:19.540
Build a bright future.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.253
That is behind me.

08:26.756 --> 08:27.590
Behind <i>us</i>.

08:36.474 --> 08:40.603
Uh, a medium hazelnut latte
and an iced oat milk latte

08:40.686 --> 08:42.855
with caramel and lavender.

08:49.320 --> 08:52.532
I don't know how you can order
a mess like that with a straight face.

08:53.991 --> 08:55.326
The last one's not for me.

08:55.409 --> 08:56.786
Yeah. It's for Annie.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.329
How did you know?

08:59.539 --> 09:01.707
I'm pretty sure she's the only person
on the planet

09:01.791 --> 09:03.793
that drinks that ungodly combination.

09:03.876 --> 09:07.129
I tell her it smells like a bar of soap,
but she insists that it's delicious.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.884
Come on. Have a seat
while they fire up the cauldron.

09:14.845 --> 09:18.558
-You waiting on a coffee too?
-No, I just wanted a change in scenery.

09:23.020 --> 09:24.063
Your cast is gone.

09:24.981 --> 09:25.815
Yeah.

09:26.524 --> 09:29.485
But, uh, I got a long way to go
before I'm back in top form.

09:32.572 --> 09:33.823
I feel awful.

09:34.782 --> 09:35.658
Nah, it's…

09:40.538 --> 09:43.249
I've learned a lot
since I started hanging out with Annie.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.419
-Yeah, she's got a knack for that.
-Yeah.

09:47.461 --> 09:50.381
So owning up to my messes
is something that I'm working on,

09:50.923 --> 09:53.384
and I'm genuinely sorry that I hurt you.

09:55.803 --> 09:57.763
Uh, it was an accident.

09:57.847 --> 09:58.806
I get that.

09:59.307 --> 10:02.059
I've been competing with you
for as long as I can remember.

10:02.143 --> 10:04.520
Trying to beat you
made me the best I could be.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.857
Even after what I did,
you were still there for us at State.

10:07.940 --> 10:09.650
Yeah, well, where else was I gonna be?

10:10.234 --> 10:12.153
I should've said thank you back then.

10:13.487 --> 10:14.572
Yeah, well, uh…

10:16.699 --> 10:17.575
you're welcome.

10:20.745 --> 10:21.787
We're a team.

10:22.496 --> 10:23.789
Sure are now,

10:23.873 --> 10:27.043
and I can't wait till you come back
and knock me down in the rotation.

10:27.126 --> 10:28.544
Why… why would you say that?

10:28.628 --> 10:30.755
'Cause I'm never gonna be
as good as you, man.

10:31.255 --> 10:35.092
I just love playing, and if I'm playing
as your backup, that's fine too.

10:36.177 --> 10:39.472
Yeah. You know, I'm not even sure
I have it in me to not be the starter.

10:39.555 --> 10:40.890
You won't have to.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.225
I appreciate that, but…

10:47.271 --> 10:48.731
Two coffees for Jackson.

10:48.814 --> 10:50.316
Uh, you should tell Annie

10:50.399 --> 10:52.568
she should really give
hazelnut another chance.

11:13.339 --> 11:14.632
For the celebration of life,

11:14.715 --> 11:17.593
this poem that Miss Frances
asked you to read.

11:17.677 --> 11:18.594
Do you know it?

11:18.678 --> 11:21.931
It was her favorite.
She made me memorize it in middle school.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.350
So then you don't…
don't need to print it out.

11:24.433 --> 11:26.102
Oh, I'll bring a copy.

11:26.185 --> 11:30.481
I'd hate to draw a blank and dishonor her
in the emotion of the moment.

11:30.564 --> 11:37.113
Well, then, I think that is everything
we need to discuss.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.030
Is it?

11:38.614 --> 11:39.615
Hmm.

11:40.408 --> 11:41.242
So…

11:42.076 --> 11:43.661
There is one more thing.

11:44.245 --> 11:47.790
Since the night I got in the cab,
when you said it was the last time,

11:49.125 --> 11:52.586
I've been replaying and rethinking it all.

11:53.421 --> 11:56.757
And then when Miss Grace told me
that Aunt Frances was gone…

12:04.223 --> 12:06.434
I have been a fool, Helen.

12:06.517 --> 12:08.602
I let despair overtake hope.

12:09.186 --> 12:14.692
I let… the tragedy I see every day
blind me to the promise of the future.

12:14.775 --> 12:17.153
Wha… what you do is hard.

12:17.236 --> 12:20.281
I don't wanna get to the end of my life
and realize pride and vanity

12:20.364 --> 12:23.242
kept me from experiencing life fully.

12:23.325 --> 12:25.286
No. You're smarter than that.

12:28.789 --> 12:32.251
I was nowhere near smart to let
the best thing that happened to me end

12:32.334 --> 12:36.338
because of some high-flown notion
about how wanting a family made me weak.

12:39.258 --> 12:40.092
Helen.

12:42.845 --> 12:45.473
I… I have no right to come back to town
and say I've changed

12:45.556 --> 12:47.683
and expect you to welcome me back,

12:47.767 --> 12:51.228
but I know Aunt Frances would tan my hide
if I didn't speak my truth.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.564
And what is your truth, Ryan?

12:54.148 --> 12:54.982
I…

12:57.735 --> 12:58.861
I want children.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.578
We can talk about it
after the celebration.

13:18.047 --> 13:22.593
I ran outta time with her.
I don't wanna run outta time with you.

13:35.231 --> 13:36.649
Damn it!

13:39.610 --> 13:41.529
Ooh! You might just spoil me, young lady.

13:41.612 --> 13:45.616
Well, you let me know when I get close.
Is there anything else I can get you?

13:46.367 --> 13:47.910
Well, there is one more thing.

13:47.993 --> 13:50.079
-If… if you don't mind.

13:50.162 --> 13:53.332
Okay. Here.

13:55.209 --> 13:56.043
Aw.

13:57.461 --> 13:58.754
Here you go.

13:58.838 --> 13:59.839
Yes.

13:59.922 --> 14:00.798
Aw.

14:00.881 --> 14:02.132
Yes, hello.

14:02.216 --> 14:04.051
-Hello!

14:04.134 --> 14:07.263
I know that she's the one you look forward
to spending your day with,

14:07.346 --> 14:11.517
but Howie insists that I be here,
being her mama and an RN and all.

14:11.600 --> 14:14.687
No, no. You are both rays of sunshine.

14:14.770 --> 14:17.189
Rebecca and I
would be honored to accompany you

14:17.273 --> 14:19.817
to Miss Frances's services
if you'd like to go.

14:19.900 --> 14:21.610
Oh, thank you. No.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.737
Be nigh unto impossible
for me to get around.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.531
I could get a wheelchair.

14:25.614 --> 14:27.700
Again, thank you, but again, no.

14:28.409 --> 14:30.411
The day should be about Frances,

14:30.494 --> 14:34.623
not about me being such an old fool
that I insist on doing a young man's job

14:34.707 --> 14:35.541
and get laid up.

14:36.250 --> 14:39.211
No, I… I will not go
and spoil that fine lady's day

14:39.295 --> 14:40.588
by being a distraction.

14:42.298 --> 14:43.966
I'll mourn her in my own way.

14:44.466 --> 14:46.093
Won't I, baby? Yes.

14:46.176 --> 14:47.803
-Yes, I know.

15:04.111 --> 15:05.529
Did I get the time wrong?

15:06.363 --> 15:09.450
-Where are the girls?
-Oh, uh, they're not coming.

15:09.533 --> 15:11.076
Oh!

15:11.160 --> 15:15.331
I thought this was a work session.
I brought a whole bunch of new ideas.

15:16.540 --> 15:17.374
Have a seat.

15:20.336 --> 15:21.754
I don't understand.

15:22.630 --> 15:24.089
Why did you wanna see me?

15:29.345 --> 15:32.973
I wanna talk about prom night
and how everything went wrong.

15:33.057 --> 15:35.351
-It's okay, Kyle.
-I've been struggling.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.145
Feeling guilty.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.065
Feeling a whole lot of things all summer.

15:42.524 --> 15:45.319
It's taken me time
and help from Dr. Ashley

15:45.402 --> 15:48.280
and some other people
to sort everything out,

15:48.364 --> 15:52.076
and I still have a ways to go,
but here's what I'm absolutely clear on.

15:54.662 --> 15:57.790
I like you,
and I'd like to go out with you.

15:59.041 --> 16:00.459
Out? Like,

16:01.251 --> 16:03.337
out on a… date?

16:03.420 --> 16:07.132
Yes. A date. If you're interested.
I would never want you to feel like--

16:07.216 --> 16:09.593
Yes! That would be amazing!

16:10.886 --> 16:12.012
Absolutely amazing.

16:19.061 --> 16:22.231
I keep hearing
Miss Frances's voice in my head.

16:22.314 --> 16:26.485
"Hope is the thing with feathers
that perches in the soul."

16:26.568 --> 16:30.698
"Sings a tune without the words
and never stops at all."

16:30.781 --> 16:32.616
You too, huh?

16:32.700 --> 16:33.659
Oh yeah.

16:33.742 --> 16:35.786
Miss Frances never let anyone
get out of Serenity High

16:35.869 --> 16:37.079
without learning a poem or two.

16:37.162 --> 16:39.498
Yeah, she shaped
a lot of souls over her years.

16:39.581 --> 16:41.291
-She did.
-God bless her.

16:41.375 --> 16:42.209
Amen.

16:42.876 --> 16:45.504
-All right--
-Afternoon, Ty. How are you doing today?

16:45.587 --> 16:47.089
-Fine, thanks.
-What's up, buddy?

16:47.172 --> 16:50.092
Uh, my mom asked me to pick the plaques up
and drop them off to you guys.

16:50.175 --> 16:52.386
Very thoughtful of her. And you.

16:52.469 --> 16:55.180
Well, we're a step or two shy
of being ready for this,

16:55.264 --> 16:57.975
so I'll go to the hardware store
and pick up the stain.

16:58.475 --> 16:59.977
-Nice to see you, Ty.
-You too.

17:00.060 --> 17:02.062
-Back in a bit, Ronnie.
-Thanks, Skeeter.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.733
I knew you worked with Skeeter
on houses and stuff,

17:05.816 --> 17:07.526
but I never knew you did this kinda work.

17:07.609 --> 17:11.363
Really? You don't remember
my workshop in the back of the house?

17:11.447 --> 17:14.324
The one I used to shoo y'all out of
when you were little

17:14.408 --> 17:16.994
so you didn't pull power tools
down on your head.

17:17.077 --> 17:18.162
Oh, yeah.

17:18.245 --> 17:21.707
You… you made those wooden trucks
for me and Kyle one Christmas.

17:21.790 --> 17:24.877
-I still think I have one on my bookshelf.
-Wow, I'm honored.

17:25.377 --> 17:28.297
Yeah, I guess I sort of lost track.

17:28.797 --> 17:31.633
Yeah.
Because I sort of stopped?

17:33.010 --> 17:37.806
There was a time when I thought
custom woodwork was my zone, you know?

17:37.890 --> 17:41.185
But you get swept up
in someone else's passion

17:41.268 --> 17:42.811
and forget it's not yours.

17:45.689 --> 17:47.900
I've been thinking a lot lately about

17:48.859 --> 17:50.194
the shelf life of a dream

17:50.277 --> 17:54.448
and wondering if it's ever too late
to change course.

17:54.531 --> 17:55.908
A dream deferred.

17:56.408 --> 17:59.495
Good. I see someone
at Serenity High's still teaching poetry.

18:00.496 --> 18:01.580
What do you think?

18:03.207 --> 18:05.084
-Is it ever too late?
-I hope not.

18:05.167 --> 18:08.128
Which is why I asked Skeeter
if I could use his workshop

18:08.212 --> 18:12.091
and… get back into
the kinda work I always wanted to do.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.134
I mean, it's not gonna support me.

18:14.218 --> 18:15.844
Well, not yet anyway.

18:15.928 --> 18:16.845
But it could.

18:17.346 --> 18:20.140
Yeah. Even if it doesn't, it…

18:21.642 --> 18:23.143
it feels good to get back at it.

18:23.227 --> 18:26.897
To remember that
just because you've traveled a distance

18:26.980 --> 18:30.734
doesn't mean you can't turn
or… turn around.

18:30.818 --> 18:32.778
Is it weird that

18:33.570 --> 18:35.906
having choices is
kind of a new concept for me?

18:35.989 --> 18:38.742
No, because you don't have many at 17.

18:39.326 --> 18:40.244
I have some.

18:40.786 --> 18:44.540
Of course. Hey. If you got time to talk,
I got time to listen.

18:45.707 --> 18:48.502
I… I appreciate that,
but I actually gotta go.

18:50.045 --> 18:52.631
All right.
Well, you know where to find me.

18:53.674 --> 18:55.884
Yeah. Yeah, I do now.

18:57.469 --> 18:58.971
-Thanks.
-Talk soon, bud.

18:59.054 --> 18:59.888
Yeah.

19:07.563 --> 19:08.814
Hey, Nell.

19:08.897 --> 19:10.357
Sorry to be late, Mama.

19:10.440 --> 19:14.027
Need I remind you that tomorrow
at all of the various and sundry events

19:14.111 --> 19:15.529
honoring Miss Frances,

19:15.612 --> 19:18.115
you two are to be
on your very best behavior?

19:18.782 --> 19:21.410
-Remember whose children you are.
-God's.

19:21.493 --> 19:22.619
Jackson.

19:22.703 --> 19:24.705
The mayor's children. Yes, ma'am.

19:24.788 --> 19:28.333
Stand up straight,
smile, be polite, look people in the eye.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.335
Don't engage in negative conversation.

19:30.419 --> 19:33.922
In particular, I want you to give
the Townsend children

19:34.006 --> 19:36.133
and the Sullivan child a wide berth.

19:36.216 --> 19:38.260
Tomorrow and forever.

19:39.928 --> 19:41.680
-Yes, ma'am.
-No, ma'am.

19:42.681 --> 19:44.266
Jackson Butler Lewis,

19:45.142 --> 19:46.852
you may think you are being funny,

19:46.935 --> 19:50.272
but you are being disrespectful,
and I raised you better than that.

19:50.355 --> 19:51.732
Do I make myself clear?

19:54.735 --> 19:55.694
Thank you.

20:08.707 --> 20:09.708
Okay, babe.

20:10.751 --> 20:12.085
Where do you wanna start?

20:22.763 --> 20:25.390
Uh, no, no, no. No. Hey, hey, look. Look.

20:26.558 --> 20:30.395
I know that there is
work to be done, okay? But--

20:30.479 --> 20:31.480
Come with me.

20:32.314 --> 20:33.440
Please.

20:44.576 --> 20:45.911
Wait, is that…

20:47.496 --> 20:49.414
Classic Sierra Grande.

20:51.416 --> 20:53.418
The one I was restoring when…

20:53.919 --> 20:55.921
When I kicked you out. The same.

20:59.758 --> 21:03.178
I was so sure you sold it
before I crossed the county line.

21:03.679 --> 21:06.306
I thought about it
more than once,

21:06.390 --> 21:09.977
but then I put it in storage.

21:11.103 --> 21:16.316
Yesterday I took it out and had Alex
over at the service station clean it up.

21:16.400 --> 21:17.693
It still needs work.

21:18.735 --> 21:20.362
You can pick up where you left off.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.076
-Sweetheart.

21:26.159 --> 21:28.996
And, yes, I… I know… I know that we…

21:29.997 --> 21:31.415
we still need work,

21:31.498 --> 21:33.375
but your truck,

21:34.042 --> 21:35.127
workshop…

21:37.754 --> 21:39.214
and your place in my bed

21:39.965 --> 21:40.924
are still here.

21:42.217 --> 21:44.678
Just waiting to welcome you back.

21:47.848 --> 21:50.726
Come home, Ronnie.

21:57.107 --> 21:58.025
Ronnie.

21:58.567 --> 21:59.401
It's just

22:00.902 --> 22:02.654
I've been pushing so hard for a yes

22:02.738 --> 22:05.365
because I didn't wanna give you
a chance to say no.

22:10.746 --> 22:11.580
Yes.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.173
Yes.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.051
Yes.

22:31.892 --> 22:35.228
Thank you for making the time.
I know your days are full,

22:35.312 --> 22:38.315
but we need to have
a private, uninterrupted conversation,

22:38.398 --> 22:40.901
and, well, I thought
this was the best option.

22:40.984 --> 22:41.902
Please.

22:47.741 --> 22:48.867
What's going on, Bill?

22:49.368 --> 22:51.036
I just got some news.

22:52.704 --> 22:55.123
Some shocking news.

22:55.207 --> 22:58.210
I am willing to carry this burden alone,

22:58.293 --> 23:01.922
but you still should know,

23:02.005 --> 23:05.050
and when you think the time is right,

23:06.134 --> 23:07.636
the kids should know too.

23:08.387 --> 23:09.221
Bill?

23:10.680 --> 23:11.515
Are you sick?

23:11.598 --> 23:14.518
No. Maddie, no. Listen.

23:14.601 --> 23:15.894
In high school,

23:17.062 --> 23:20.816
before you and I got serious,

23:23.777 --> 23:25.404
Peggy Martin and I--

23:30.409 --> 23:31.701
You're Isaac's father.

23:33.703 --> 23:35.080
I would have spared you

23:35.664 --> 23:38.667
if I could, Maddie,
but he's here in Serenity.

23:38.750 --> 23:39.709
Yes!

23:40.419 --> 23:41.253
He is.

23:42.212 --> 23:43.964
Alongside all your other children.

23:46.466 --> 23:49.678
Sweet weeping Jesus, Bill.

23:49.761 --> 23:52.347
Well, now, listen.
I only found out myself.

23:52.431 --> 23:53.723
I just talked to him myself.

23:53.807 --> 23:55.475
Oh, poor Bill!

23:55.559 --> 23:58.603
God, I thought I was done being furious!

23:58.687 --> 24:01.481
Being wounded. But guess what?

24:01.565 --> 24:07.237
I've messed up so many times,
and I've hurt you every single one,

24:07.320 --> 24:09.823
but I am sincerely sorry, Maddie.

24:09.906 --> 24:13.660
When are you gonna stop
demanding to be forgiven?

24:15.662 --> 24:17.122
I know that we all sin,

24:17.205 --> 24:19.875
and we all fall short
of the glory of God sometimes,

24:19.958 --> 24:23.795
but you… you, Bill Townsend,
you've made it an Olympic sport.

24:23.879 --> 24:27.174
-You have every right to be angry.
-Yes! I do!

24:27.257 --> 24:30.218
And so does Ty, Kyle, Katie!

24:31.511 --> 24:34.848
And Isaac, Rebecca, Peggy, Noreen!

24:37.142 --> 24:42.314
True repentance means you try your utmost
not to repeat the same mistake.

24:43.315 --> 24:46.276
When are you gonna start
taking responsibility for the havoc

24:46.359 --> 24:48.445
that you wreak in people's lives?

24:48.528 --> 24:50.864
You do not get
to burn down the house, Bill,

24:50.947 --> 24:53.283
and just apologize for lighting the match!

24:57.078 --> 25:00.707
I understand
if you aren't able to forgive me--

25:00.790 --> 25:01.917
No!

25:02.000 --> 25:03.793
No, Bill! No!

25:04.711 --> 25:06.046
Listen to yourself.

25:06.129 --> 25:09.883
You do not get to weasel out of this
by making this some failing on my part.

25:09.966 --> 25:12.594
No, Maddie. I failed <i>you</i>.

25:12.677 --> 25:14.763
-Yes!
-I failed all of you.

25:14.846 --> 25:16.139
Yes, you did!

25:17.349 --> 25:20.143
I <i>do </i>regret.

25:23.730 --> 25:26.733
I <i>do </i>repent.

25:48.171 --> 25:49.339
And I do forgive.

25:51.216 --> 25:53.343
So I am letting you go.

25:57.055 --> 25:58.181
And I release you…

26:00.684 --> 26:01.935
into the hands of God.

26:02.519 --> 26:04.604
And may he bless you on your way forward,

26:04.688 --> 26:07.941
but that walk is yours alone.

26:09.859 --> 26:10.777
Please leave.

26:11.695 --> 26:13.488
Just… I gotta lock up.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.103
You deny any of this?

26:45.186 --> 26:46.605
Listen, the facts

26:47.981 --> 26:51.526
are true, but a lot's happened since then.
I'm a completely different person.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.403
It was assault and battery.

26:54.195 --> 26:55.113
Yeah… yeah, but how--

26:55.196 --> 26:57.782
I think we've heard
everything we need to hear, Sherman.

26:57.866 --> 27:01.411
Besides, none of us wants to be late
for Miss Frances's funeral.

27:01.494 --> 27:02.704
Let's put it to a vote.

27:03.204 --> 27:05.915
All in favor
of terminating Cal Maddox's contract

27:05.999 --> 27:09.169
with Serenity High School
on grounds of moral turpitude.

27:20.639 --> 27:23.433
- Let me check on Annie.
-Ah-ah-ah.

27:23.516 --> 27:24.893
Get back here.

27:26.436 --> 27:27.562
Oh dear.

27:39.115 --> 27:41.826
I'm sorry. I couldn't decide
what to wear. We can go.

27:41.910 --> 27:44.120
No, no, no. Wait. Hold on a sec.

27:44.204 --> 27:47.707
Uh, we have something to tell you
before we go to the funeral.

27:49.459 --> 27:51.419
Is everything okay?

27:51.503 --> 27:54.214
Oh, everything's…
…terrific, baby girl.

27:56.966 --> 27:58.134
I'm moving back in.

28:01.221 --> 28:03.598
Wow. That's amazing.

28:04.099 --> 28:06.935
Back home with my best girls.

28:07.018 --> 28:09.604
-I'm the happiest man on the planet.

28:10.522 --> 28:11.398
Annie?

28:12.065 --> 28:13.608
I'm sorry, I just, um…

28:14.192 --> 28:15.527
I don't know.

28:16.945 --> 28:18.113
It's… it's great.

28:19.989 --> 28:22.909
It's just a lot. I don't…

28:24.077 --> 28:25.870
Yeah. I know it is. Come here.

28:28.498 --> 28:30.166
It's okay, sweetheart.

28:30.250 --> 28:31.126
It's okay.

29:04.576 --> 29:05.785
How was the funeral?

29:06.369 --> 29:08.830
It was beautiful. And the interment too.

29:09.456 --> 29:12.375
Chef's inside.
Everything should be ready for guests.

29:13.168 --> 29:14.043
Isaac…

29:16.755 --> 29:18.381
I spoke with Bill last night.

29:18.965 --> 29:19.883
Ah…

29:21.718 --> 29:22.594
Okay.

29:25.555 --> 29:28.433
-I don't know what to say.
-Me neither.

29:40.195 --> 29:41.029
We'll talk later.

29:41.112 --> 29:42.489
-That'd be great.
-Okay.

29:53.708 --> 29:56.419
I went back to get some programs
for the folks who couldn't come,

29:56.503 --> 29:58.213
but there weren't very many left.

29:58.296 --> 30:01.591
-Oh. June might have extras.
-What's going on with Isaac?

30:03.218 --> 30:06.763
He's such a sweet young boy,
but there's a… a sadness to him

30:06.846 --> 30:08.389
I can't quite define.

30:09.474 --> 30:10.517
Is he all right?

30:13.019 --> 30:13.853
Yes.

30:18.191 --> 30:19.234
Well,

30:20.151 --> 30:22.779
whatever it is, I'm here for you.

30:24.113 --> 30:25.073
Aw.

30:32.080 --> 30:34.624
-Good afternoon, Mr. Daniels.
-Good afternoon.

30:34.707 --> 30:36.960
This is from our book club
at the synagogue.

30:37.043 --> 30:39.003
I always called Frances
for recommendations.

30:39.087 --> 30:40.630
Well, much appreciated, sir.

30:40.713 --> 30:41.714
My pleasure.

30:42.507 --> 30:46.594
I doubt there's a florist between here
and the Georgia line with any stock left.

30:47.846 --> 30:50.598
Well, Miss Frances asked
if people donate to the library,

30:50.682 --> 30:53.935
but some folks don't think they've mourned
until they send flowers.

30:54.018 --> 30:57.939
Hmm. I wish I had a chance
to spend more time with Miss Frances.

30:58.523 --> 31:00.859
-She struck me as an exceptional woman.
-Oh, she--

31:00.942 --> 31:01.943
She was.

31:02.777 --> 31:04.028
In every way.

31:05.280 --> 31:08.241
Serenity has an overabundance
of exceptional women.

31:10.201 --> 31:11.411
We are blessed.

31:14.247 --> 31:17.333
Shall we bump the schedule 20 minutes,
since church and graveside both ran long?

31:17.417 --> 31:19.836
Since people are still strolling over,
why don't we make it 30?

31:19.919 --> 31:20.920
We'll talk afterwards.

31:29.470 --> 31:32.140
You know, I think these
would be perfect on the porch.

31:32.223 --> 31:33.725
Why don't we take them out there?

31:44.611 --> 31:47.822
Careful, Isaac.
She will charm the socks off ya.

31:47.906 --> 31:49.365
Already has, sir.

31:50.742 --> 31:54.078
-Thanks for inviting me for lunch.
-Thank you for <i>bringing</i> lunch.

31:54.162 --> 31:57.040
Oh, Chef did say to tell you
that it was packed with best wishes.

31:57.123 --> 31:58.124
Hmm.

31:58.207 --> 32:01.586
-Hope there's a good turnout.
-We sure cooked for a crowd.

32:02.378 --> 32:05.548
I just… I felt odd about staying
'cause I didn't know Miss Frances.

32:05.632 --> 32:06.466
Did you?

32:06.549 --> 32:09.052
Oh. I knew her.

32:10.470 --> 32:14.933
-And I loved her. My whole life.
-You didn't tell me that.

32:15.016 --> 32:17.936
Well, wouldn't wanna spill
all my secrets at once.

32:18.019 --> 32:20.355
Well, I have to say
that one's more interesting

32:20.438 --> 32:22.273
than you putting
maple syrup in your whiskey.

32:23.858 --> 32:26.152
Uh, so you and Miss Frances were a couple.

32:26.653 --> 32:28.446
No. Sadly.

32:29.197 --> 32:32.241
I loved her, but she loved someone else.

32:32.825 --> 32:36.579
I kept hoping she might come to love me
one day, but she never did.

32:36.663 --> 32:39.332
Well, not in the way that I wanted anyway.

32:39.415 --> 32:44.087
But she was the very truest of friends,
and I learned to accept that as enough.

32:45.672 --> 32:49.801
Life is really all about
learning to balance your dreams

32:50.802 --> 32:52.053
with your truth.

32:53.888 --> 32:55.306
Yes, sir, it is.

33:59.912 --> 34:00.913
Thank you.

34:00.997 --> 34:04.625
You know, my, uh, papa used to say,
"Live your eulogy."

34:05.752 --> 34:08.463
Never quite… quite understood that
until this morning.

34:09.213 --> 34:11.007
Miss Frances was quite a lady.

34:12.091 --> 34:16.012
She was always super sweet to me,
in a strict sort of way.

34:16.095 --> 34:18.181
Yeah, that sounds about right.

34:20.183 --> 34:21.017
Hey.

34:22.935 --> 34:26.522
-You sure you're okay with me coming home?
-Sure. Of course.

34:28.107 --> 34:29.650
I just don't know what to expect.

34:29.734 --> 34:32.779
You know, you've been gone a while,
and things have changed.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.531
Thanks for being honest.

34:36.783 --> 34:37.700
I get it.

34:37.784 --> 34:39.368
We'll have to settle back in.

34:41.412 --> 34:42.538
What if it doesn't work?

34:43.289 --> 34:46.125
Hey, you have my promise.

34:46.209 --> 34:49.003
I will try my hardest every day
to be sure that it does.

34:49.504 --> 34:51.130
For your mother and for you.

35:07.855 --> 35:08.856
I admire you.

35:10.525 --> 35:11.484
You're so strong.

35:14.987 --> 35:15.905
You too.

35:25.331 --> 35:28.209
This is
such a wonderful gesture.

35:28.876 --> 35:32.213
You know, when I go, don't let people
fight too hard over my <i>Saga</i> comics.

35:32.797 --> 35:34.715
-I'll burn them with you.
-Oh.

35:35.466 --> 35:36.300
No.

35:36.384 --> 35:37.468
<i>Saga</i>?

35:37.552 --> 35:38.386
Seriously?

35:38.469 --> 35:40.805
How did I not know
you were a comics guy, Trotter?

35:40.888 --> 35:42.932
Because I didn't know <i>you</i> were!

35:44.142 --> 35:46.310
Here endeth the lesson, I suppose.

35:47.019 --> 35:48.855
You can't judge a book by its cover,

35:48.938 --> 35:52.150
but you <i>can </i>get a sense of someone
by the books that they like.

35:52.233 --> 35:55.611
When you get to college, if you meet
anyone who loves <i>Catcher in the</i> <i>Rye</i>

35:55.695 --> 35:57.029
or <i>The Fountainhead…</i>

35:57.113 --> 35:57.947
…run.

36:00.700 --> 36:02.743
Well, I… I appreciate the warning.

36:02.827 --> 36:04.912
Do you think
Miss Frances collected comics?

36:04.996 --> 36:06.164
Perhaps.

36:06.247 --> 36:08.833
She strikes me as a lady
with a secret or two.

36:08.916 --> 36:12.211
And maybe there's a first-run <i>X-Men</i>
lurking somewhere in here.

36:12.295 --> 36:14.255
-Dibs if you find it.
-All right.

36:15.673 --> 36:17.175
You're gonna make a great dad.

36:20.386 --> 36:21.345
So are you.

36:23.890 --> 36:26.350
-Hey, Trotter, what are you…
-Hello, Ty.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.520
Lily. I didn't realize you were here.

36:31.939 --> 36:33.900
-Did you know Miss Frances?
-Not really.

36:33.983 --> 36:37.445
My mom and dad talked to her a lot
at church though, so here we are.

36:37.528 --> 36:38.571
Yeah.

36:39.447 --> 36:42.283
-Is CeCe here?
-No, I… I heard she was out of town.

36:43.492 --> 36:46.704
It must be tough
to be going through so many changes.

36:48.873 --> 36:50.374
It's a part of life, right?

36:51.626 --> 36:57.215
Still, if you ever need someone
to talk to, I'm a really good listener.

37:05.598 --> 37:07.516
Assault and battery?!

37:07.600 --> 37:10.061
Okay, it was a party
with a bunch of former teammates,

37:10.144 --> 37:12.605
including Victoria's other man.

37:12.688 --> 37:15.566
They came just to show off
her engagement ring, and it got ugly.

37:15.650 --> 37:17.944
And I slugged him,
but… but charges were never filed.

37:18.027 --> 37:19.779
And Jodie said
she scrubbed every trace of it,

37:19.862 --> 37:21.614
so I have no idea
how Mary Vaughn found out--

37:21.697 --> 37:24.450
Well, she found out about it before me,
and that's what hurts.

37:24.533 --> 37:28.788
Look, I know. But it never occurred to me
that she was referring to <i>this</i>.

37:28.871 --> 37:30.706
You should have told me anyway, Cal.

37:32.208 --> 37:34.335
-What else are you hiding?
-Nothing.

37:35.002 --> 37:38.464
I told you about rehab, and that was
the worst nightmare of my entire life.

37:38.547 --> 37:40.299
I am not hiding anything.

37:40.383 --> 37:41.217
I've just…

37:42.051 --> 37:44.553
I've lost my ability to handle surprises.

37:44.637 --> 37:45.596
Okay.

37:45.680 --> 37:46.681
Here's the thing.

37:47.223 --> 37:48.307
You know who I am.

37:49.225 --> 37:51.310
Who I've worked so hard to become.

37:51.894 --> 37:56.732
That idiot that punched Drew, he's gone.
That mess that went to rehab, gone.

37:56.816 --> 37:59.485
And I swear on everything
that is good and holy,

37:59.568 --> 38:03.489
I have changed and grown,
and I have learned from my mistakes.

38:03.572 --> 38:04.532
I know, Cal.

38:05.449 --> 38:07.868
I know. We'll get through this.

38:15.793 --> 38:18.587
We could talk
to scouts individually.

38:18.671 --> 38:21.215
We could get you
a better physical therapist.

38:21.299 --> 38:25.094
Just 'cause your coach doesn't see
any options doesn't mean they don't exist.

38:25.177 --> 38:26.345
Here's the thing, Dad.

38:30.141 --> 38:32.351
I'm not sure
I wanna play baseball anymore.

38:32.977 --> 38:35.146
Well, that's nonsense.

38:35.229 --> 38:37.898
I've had a lot of time
to think this summer.

38:37.982 --> 38:40.693
More time than I've had in a long while,

38:40.776 --> 38:43.821
and I figured out that

38:44.905 --> 38:49.327
I liked baseball because it came easy
and because you liked it.

38:50.161 --> 38:52.496
But I… I want something more.

38:52.580 --> 38:57.251
Well, it was never my intention
to force you onto a path, Tyler.

38:58.210 --> 38:59.670
You have talent.

39:00.212 --> 39:02.131
And I thought you had joy.

39:02.214 --> 39:03.799
I'm sorry if you didn't.

39:03.883 --> 39:04.717
No, Dad,

39:04.800 --> 39:07.178
I wouldn't trade those games that I played

39:07.261 --> 39:10.306
and the games
that we went to for anything.

39:10.890 --> 39:13.851
And I'm not saying
that baseball is out of my life.

39:13.934 --> 39:15.144
I just don't want it

39:15.853 --> 39:18.230
to be the <i>only</i> thing in my life.

39:21.609 --> 39:23.152
How did this happen?

39:24.862 --> 39:27.865
Your first T-ball game
was about a week ago.

39:27.948 --> 39:30.493
Could barely keep your hat on
and your pants up,

39:30.576 --> 39:32.119
-and now here you are…

39:32.661 --> 39:33.662
…a young man.

39:35.581 --> 39:38.125
With a great future.

39:43.464 --> 39:47.676
You're gonna have to give me some time
to wrestle with this, son. It's…

39:47.760 --> 39:51.639
it's tough for a parent
to recognize the moment

39:51.722 --> 39:53.724
that's the beginning of letting go.

39:54.767 --> 39:56.560
We'll always be connected, Dad.

40:10.408 --> 40:11.951
What the heck just happened?

40:14.161 --> 40:15.329
I just told Dad

40:15.413 --> 40:17.957
that I don't wanna play baseball
in college anymore.

40:20.876 --> 40:22.586
Oh, hey, hey.

40:22.670 --> 40:24.463
-Seriously, are you okay?
-What does this mean?

40:24.547 --> 40:28.592
I have absolutely no idea, and it feels

40:29.927 --> 40:30.761
great!

40:31.387 --> 40:32.221
Come here, man.

40:36.475 --> 40:37.309
Come on.

40:38.269 --> 40:39.520
You two are the best.

40:39.603 --> 40:43.023
Seriously. Now. Then. Always.

40:43.107 --> 40:44.775
Yeah, you're not so bad yourself.

40:45.276 --> 40:47.278
You two are the brothers I never wanted.

40:55.327 --> 40:57.329
Hey. Hey, come here.

40:58.873 --> 41:00.207
Did you get fired?

41:00.291 --> 41:01.959
I knew I should've started a betting pool

41:02.042 --> 41:05.087
on how fast word would get out,
but gambling violates my contract too.

41:05.171 --> 41:06.881
Oh merciful heavens! Cal!

41:06.964 --> 41:08.966
I just told Maddie.
Please yell at me later.

41:09.049 --> 41:11.802
I don't wanna yell at you. I wanna help.

41:11.886 --> 41:13.888
Yes. Please, I don't…

41:16.140 --> 41:17.558
I don't wanna lose everything.

41:19.393 --> 41:20.311
Cal.

41:24.064 --> 41:26.442
Nellie, don't be pretentious.

41:45.503 --> 41:47.129
So, Jimmy Cleveland,

41:47.213 --> 41:50.716
he, uh, walks over to the edge
of the stage to clear his spit valve.

41:51.425 --> 41:54.136
-And Frances, she picks up her drink.
-An old-fashioned.

41:54.220 --> 41:57.431
Oh, no, no. She's drinking a sloe gin fizz
'cause she was underage.

41:57.515 --> 41:58.474
-What?!

41:58.557 --> 42:02.269
But she holds out her glass to catch
what is coming out of that valve.

42:02.353 --> 42:03.187
Ew.

42:03.270 --> 42:07.274
And I asked her, I said,
"Have you lost your ever-loving mind?"

42:07.942 --> 42:08.901
She says,

42:09.568 --> 42:11.403
"The man is a treasure."

42:12.238 --> 42:14.323
"It seemed the proper response."

42:18.827 --> 42:22.957
I… I wonder, would you do me the favor
to get that book for me, Noreen?

42:23.040 --> 42:24.041
Mm-hmm.

42:24.792 --> 42:26.377
Frances gave it to me.

42:26.460 --> 42:28.462
It's got her favorite poem in it.

42:28.546 --> 42:32.383
It just somehow seems fitting
to share it with the two of you today.

42:33.759 --> 42:34.760
Hmm.

42:42.643 --> 42:44.853
"When I am dead, my dearest,

42:44.937 --> 42:47.356
sing no sad songs for me."

42:48.732 --> 42:51.360
"Plant thou no roses at my head,

42:51.986 --> 42:53.988
nor shady cypress tree."

42:55.614 --> 42:57.616
"Be the green grass above me,

42:58.951 --> 43:01.996
with showers and dewdrops wet."

43:02.955 --> 43:04.123
"And if thou wilt,

43:05.165 --> 43:06.041
remember,

43:09.086 --> 43:10.170
and if thou wilt,

43:11.338 --> 43:12.214
forget."

43:15.259 --> 43:17.136
"I shall not see the shadows,

43:20.931 --> 43:22.558
I shall not feel the rain."

43:25.352 --> 43:27.187
"I shall not hear the nightingale

43:29.523 --> 43:31.483
sing on, as if in pain."

43:34.194 --> 43:36.196
"And dreaming through the twilight

43:38.490 --> 43:40.075
that doth not rise

43:42.036 --> 43:42.870
nor set,

43:44.997 --> 43:46.498
haply I may remember,

43:49.126 --> 43:50.294
and haply

43:51.629 --> 43:52.546
may forget."

44:10.064 --> 44:11.690
Oh! Excuse me!

44:11.774 --> 44:14.318
Uh, are you Dana Sue's daughter?

44:14.401 --> 44:15.402
Yes, ma'am. I am.

44:15.486 --> 44:18.906
Oh. Yeah, you look like
something she'd spit out.

44:20.699 --> 44:22.368
She still busy wrecking people's lives?

44:34.755 --> 44:35.964
What a day.

44:37.383 --> 44:41.637
Who'd have thought that when we presented
this bench to Miss Frances,

44:41.720 --> 44:43.180
she'd be gone so soon?

44:44.807 --> 44:47.226
-The people we love are never gone.
-Amen.

44:47.309 --> 44:49.853
I can take all the guardian angels
I can get.

44:49.937 --> 44:52.022
Listen. Just so you know,

44:52.106 --> 44:53.524
when it's my time to go,

44:53.607 --> 44:56.568
I want you three
to throw the party. All right?

44:56.652 --> 45:00.155
You girls outdid yourselves,
as Frances knew you would.

45:00.239 --> 45:02.533
Aw. It was a community outpouring.

45:02.616 --> 45:05.035
Oh, speaking of which, is Sullivan's open?

45:05.119 --> 45:07.287
Because we thought the three of us
would like to go down

45:07.371 --> 45:09.832
and pour one out in Frances's honor.

45:09.915 --> 45:12.000
Yeah, Erik's running things,
and I'll be over shortly.

45:12.084 --> 45:13.752
Perfect. And I'll be buying.

45:13.836 --> 45:15.087
-Oh!
-Oh wow.

45:18.006 --> 45:20.342
-Candice.
-Helen. Sorry to interrupt.

45:20.426 --> 45:22.428
I'm here on instructions
from Miss Frances.

45:22.511 --> 45:24.179
-So are we all, darling.

45:24.263 --> 45:27.558
Neville, Miss Paula,
Miss Grace, this is Candice Benjamin,

45:27.641 --> 45:30.352
the lawyer who helped
with the sale of the spa for Miss Frances.

45:30.436 --> 45:32.354
-Nice to meet you,
-Did we forget something today?

45:32.438 --> 45:33.772
Oh, not at all.

45:33.856 --> 45:36.108
Miss Frances drew up her will
with a lawyer in Charleston,

45:36.191 --> 45:37.651
but I'm executor.

45:37.735 --> 45:40.988
I have precise instructions
on the delivery of a particular item.

45:41.905 --> 45:45.200
Dana Sue, can I speak with you
a moment? Privately?

45:47.286 --> 45:49.121
Uh, yeah.

45:50.914 --> 45:51.999
See you later.

45:52.082 --> 45:53.959
Uh, Miss Frances left me somethin'?

45:54.042 --> 45:55.210
Mm-hmm.

45:55.294 --> 45:56.795
Me?

45:57.504 --> 45:58.505
Okay.

46:02.926 --> 46:03.886
Uh…

46:06.054 --> 46:07.055
Uh, this…

46:07.139 --> 46:09.600
this… this is a mistake.

46:09.683 --> 46:11.769
There's so many zeros. I…

46:12.269 --> 46:14.062
The correct number of zeros.

46:14.146 --> 46:16.523
Okay, I… I don't understand. Why me?

46:16.607 --> 46:20.235
My instructions were to give you the check
and convey Miss Frances's best wishes.

46:20.319 --> 46:21.570
Nothing more.

46:22.362 --> 46:24.448
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

46:32.331 --> 46:35.584
-You found it.
-Kissing tree's pretty much a landmark.

46:35.667 --> 46:38.170
-I know, but I've never--
-Neither have I.

46:40.881 --> 46:43.133
I'm a little confused. Your text, it was--

46:43.217 --> 46:44.843
I was typing really fast.

46:45.928 --> 46:47.763
But I had to sneak out and meet you.

46:48.889 --> 46:49.723
One last time.

46:51.934 --> 46:52.976
One last…

46:54.520 --> 46:55.729
Wh… what's going on?

46:56.855 --> 46:58.774
My mother forbids me to see you

46:59.775 --> 47:01.068
'cause of the recall,

47:01.777 --> 47:04.154
but I couldn't disappear
without explaining,

47:05.364 --> 47:06.198
and…

47:08.200 --> 47:09.409
and giving you this.

47:17.501 --> 47:21.046
-I wonder how she had that kind of money.
-Why would she leave <i>me</i> so much?

47:21.129 --> 47:23.465
Hmm, Miss Frances never did anything
without a reason,

47:23.549 --> 47:26.260
so we'll figure it out
once the shock wears off.

47:26.343 --> 47:27.469
Yeah.

47:27.553 --> 47:29.179
-Mom?
-Yeah, honey?

47:29.263 --> 47:30.597
Y'all are gonna wanna see this.

47:33.559 --> 47:36.270
That's that account
that posted that picture of me and Jeremy.

47:36.353 --> 47:39.064
Why would I give those troublemakers
two seconds of my time?

47:39.147 --> 47:41.525
I dunno who runs the account,
but you really need to watch it.

47:41.608 --> 47:43.443
Just click on the first post.

47:46.572 --> 47:48.657
<i>-Hey! What are you doing?!</i>

47:48.740 --> 47:50.075
<i>Come here. Gimme that.</i>

47:50.158 --> 47:51.577
<i>Come here! Gimme that phone.</i>

47:52.077 --> 47:53.203
It's weird, right?

47:53.287 --> 47:55.330
I figured you'd wanna know
who messed with the van.

47:56.748 --> 47:59.126
Dear Lord. She's back!

48:00.419 --> 48:02.004
What should we do?

48:02.087 --> 48:05.507
We can report the vandalism,
but beyond that, I… I don't know.

48:06.592 --> 48:07.426
I don't know.

48:11.638 --> 48:13.515
I'm nervous they'll start fighting again.

48:14.182 --> 48:16.935
Or worse, gang up on me.

48:20.230 --> 48:23.942
It's crazy how parents
can get so caught up in their own stuff

48:24.026 --> 48:25.402
and not think about us.

48:26.320 --> 48:31.158
Like my mom declaring I can't be with you
because she's mad at your mom?

48:31.241 --> 48:33.660
-It's so stupid.
-What are we going to do?

48:33.744 --> 48:34.745
Well,

48:35.245 --> 48:36.455
I don't know about you,

48:37.414 --> 48:40.876
but I'm going to defy
my mother, my father,

48:40.959 --> 48:44.713
and anybody else
who dares to give their unwanted opinion.

48:46.798 --> 48:48.508
I have to be with you.

48:50.886 --> 48:51.762
Wow.

48:52.596 --> 48:53.889
Jackson, that was, um,

48:54.765 --> 48:55.599
pretty hot.

49:13.033 --> 49:15.744
I am so sorry about the school board.
It sounds like nonsense to me

49:15.827 --> 49:18.455
and no reason at all
that you should leave the restaurant.

49:18.538 --> 49:20.916
The Lewises are looking for a diversion
because of the recall.

49:20.999 --> 49:23.168
Talk to Peggy.
See if you can get ahead of any bad press.

49:23.251 --> 49:26.630
I can't even imagine what else
Mary Vaughn might have up her sleeve.

49:27.547 --> 49:30.425
Excuse me. A guest in the dining room
is demanding to see Cal.

49:30.509 --> 49:31.677
No, Cal's not available.

49:31.760 --> 49:32.970
The man's getting all worked up

49:33.053 --> 49:35.806
'cause other guests are saying
Cal got fired from his job at the school.

49:35.889 --> 49:39.184
Go tell the gentleman
to sit down and quiet down.

49:39.267 --> 49:42.229
Cal, there must be an appeal process.

49:42.312 --> 49:45.732
-Yeah, Helen thinks there's options.
-Where is she?

49:45.816 --> 49:48.193
She's locking up the spa.
She'll be here any minute.

49:48.276 --> 49:51.196
-Chef, he stormed right by me.
-Cal, what's going on, my friend?

49:51.279 --> 49:54.616
-Looks like I got here just in time.
-Sir, please return to your seat.

49:54.700 --> 49:57.411
You don't understand.
Cal needs me, and I've got his back.

49:57.494 --> 49:58.370
Cal.

49:58.453 --> 49:59.579
Fathers and sons.

49:59.663 --> 50:00.497
Charleston.

50:00.580 --> 50:03.542
I'm here to support you, man.
You and me, we'll get it done.

50:03.625 --> 50:05.794
It's, uh, great
to see you again,

50:05.877 --> 50:07.879
but you… you really need to take a seat.

50:07.963 --> 50:11.967
-No way. Who do I have to fight?
-No. No one. Please, just stop.

50:12.050 --> 50:13.427
Or I will call the sheriff.

50:13.510 --> 50:15.595
-Stu.
-<i>She</i> remembers me.

50:15.679 --> 50:17.139
Stu, people are trying to eat.

50:17.222 --> 50:19.558
They need to be talking about
how we get you your job back.

50:19.641 --> 50:22.602
-No. No, not at all.
-Hey, buddy, I'm trying to help you.

50:22.686 --> 50:24.938
This doesn't help, Stu. Sit down!

50:25.689 --> 50:26.648
What are you doing?

50:26.732 --> 50:29.401
Dana Sue Sullivan. Let the sheriff know
we have a difficult guest.

50:29.484 --> 50:30.569
We gotta talk about this.

50:31.236 --> 50:32.654
-No!
-Hey, hey!

50:32.738 --> 50:35.866
Cal. Cal, wait for the sheriff, Cal!
Cal, wait for the sheriff!

50:39.244 --> 50:41.121
You're way over the line.

50:41.204 --> 50:43.582
A two-minute conversation
doesn't make us friends.

50:43.665 --> 50:45.375
-Outta here!
-Wait for the sheriff!

50:45.459 --> 50:49.337
-The sheriff is on his way.
-Hey, gorgeous. Tell him to listen!

50:49.421 --> 50:51.048
Do not touch her!

50:51.131 --> 50:52.841
Cal. Please.

50:53.967 --> 50:57.262
-Talk to him, Red.
-Stay back. Leave her alone.

50:57.345 --> 51:00.057
You and me. We can make him see.
We can make him see!

51:00.140 --> 51:01.433
-Stop!
-I'm trying to help!

51:01.516 --> 51:03.060
-No!

51:12.861 --> 51:14.362
Someone call Helen.

51:29.586 --> 51:30.420
Ryan.

51:32.881 --> 51:33.715
Um…

51:34.966 --> 51:36.176
Can we talk tomorrow?

51:36.259 --> 51:37.552
I only need a moment.

51:42.140 --> 51:44.226
I wanted to thank you

51:44.309 --> 51:48.146
and all the ladies for everything you did.

51:48.230 --> 51:51.608
I know Aunt Frances
is dancing with joy in heaven tonight.

51:51.691 --> 51:53.360
Well, we worked extra hard,

51:53.860 --> 51:57.405
knowing she'd be looking down
and taking notes.

51:57.489 --> 52:01.409
I hope she's looking down now
because I wouldn't want her to miss this.

52:08.834 --> 52:10.043
Helen.

52:15.382 --> 52:16.591
Will you marry me?
