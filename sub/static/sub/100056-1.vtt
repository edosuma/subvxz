WEBVTT

00:02.504 --> 00:03.945
Move it, newbies.

00:03.947 --> 00:05.889
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

00:05.890 --> 00:07.123
How did he know we were new?

00:07.124 --> 00:08.900
Maybe 'cause we're cowering in fear.

00:08.901 --> 00:10.118
Speak for yourselves.

00:10.119 --> 00:11.879
I can't wait to meet our chief resident.

00:11.880 --> 00:14.198
Rumor has it she's a real hard-ass.

00:14.199 --> 00:16.274
- (ELEVATOR DINGS)
- Oh!

00:16.276 --> 00:17.777
That must be her.

00:20.460 --> 00:22.170
Oh, God, she's terrifying.

00:22.847 --> 00:24.289
Hello, everyone.

00:24.290 --> 00:26.367
You must be the internal
medicine residents.

00:26.368 --> 00:27.852
Yes, ma'am. Here and ready.

00:27.853 --> 00:29.562
Oh, gosh. What a pleasure to meet you.

00:29.563 --> 00:31.190
Should we go around
and introduce ourselves?

00:31.191 --> 00:33.175
- Excellent idea. I'm Daniel Kutcher.
- Mm.

00:33.176 --> 00:35.001
I went to Duke, and I've published

00:35.002 --> 00:36.903
in <i> The New England Journal of Medicine.</i>

00:36.904 --> 00:38.513
- Two times.
- (CHUCKLES)

00:38.514 --> 00:40.038
Very impressive.

00:40.039 --> 00:41.682
Uh, I'm Lexie Gilani.

00:41.683 --> 00:43.626
- Mm-hmm.
- I grew up here in Southern California.

00:43.627 --> 00:45.221
I had a dog named Duke

00:45.222 --> 00:47.890
- that I successfully diagnosed with parvo.
- Oh.

00:47.891 --> 00:49.016
He died.

00:49.017 --> 00:51.360
I'm very nervous.

00:51.361 --> 00:52.561
I'm Caleb Sommers.

00:52.562 --> 00:53.813
He/Him.

00:53.814 --> 00:56.065
I just returned from Guatemala,

00:56.066 --> 00:58.401
where I practiced
medicine in the rain forest

00:58.402 --> 01:00.653
and I got a tapeworm.

01:00.654 --> 01:01.704
Wow.

01:01.705 --> 01:04.239
What an exceptional group of people.

01:04.241 --> 01:05.616
I'm Carol Kenney.

01:05.617 --> 01:07.743
I'm very into secondary infections,

01:07.744 --> 01:10.372
and I am so excited to be here!

01:14.918 --> 01:17.128
Will we be starting rounds right away?

01:17.129 --> 01:21.257
I hope so. I've waited
a long time for this day.

01:21.258 --> 01:23.926
A long time to be... chief resident?

01:23.927 --> 01:25.428
Me?

01:25.429 --> 01:27.023
(CHUCKLING): You think
I'm chief resident?

01:27.024 --> 01:29.056
No! No, this is my first day.

01:29.057 --> 01:30.824
I'm an intern, just like you.

01:30.825 --> 01:32.560
But you have a clipboard.

01:32.561 --> 01:34.437
Yes. I love clipboards.

01:34.438 --> 01:37.163
But you have a long
coat, like a resident.

01:37.164 --> 01:38.355
Oh, it's not a long coat.

01:38.356 --> 01:40.214
I'm just short.

01:40.215 --> 01:42.512
But you're...

01:42.513 --> 01:44.141
Older. Yes, I know.

01:44.142 --> 01:45.893
Yeah. This is my second career.

01:45.894 --> 01:47.575
I mean, I always wanted to be a doctor,

01:47.576 --> 01:49.618
but life got away from me.

01:49.619 --> 01:50.619
Oh.

01:50.620 --> 01:52.621
Were you in a coma?

01:52.622 --> 01:53.731
No.

01:53.732 --> 01:55.124
Got married young, had kids,

01:55.125 --> 01:56.459
taught high school science.

01:56.460 --> 01:57.960
So, why med school?

01:57.961 --> 01:59.095
I lost a bet.

01:59.096 --> 02:00.796
- (LAUGHING): No, I'm kidding.
- (CHUCKLING)

02:00.797 --> 02:03.174
My marriage fell apart.

02:03.175 --> 02:05.134
My husband went off to find himself,

02:05.135 --> 02:07.470
and now he's sleeping
on his sister's futon,

02:07.471 --> 02:10.139
and I'm a doctor, so life is good.

02:10.139 --> 02:13.142
So, if you're an intern, then
where's the chief resident?

02:13.143 --> 02:14.935
Start the patient in 24 on vancomycin,

02:14.936 --> 02:16.259
and order a CVC stat.

02:16.260 --> 02:18.160
I need a spinal tap kit in room eight

02:18.161 --> 02:20.954
and a central line in rooms
ten and 11, and good morning.

02:20.955 --> 02:23.319
I am Dr. Maya Jacobs,
your chief resident.

02:23.320 --> 02:25.488
- ALL: Whoa.
- Hey, Dr. Jacobs.

02:25.489 --> 02:27.990
They thought I was
you. Isn't that funny?

02:27.991 --> 02:29.325
Very.

02:29.326 --> 02:31.051
Internal medicine residents,

02:31.052 --> 02:33.232
welcome to Loyola Memorial Hospital.

02:33.233 --> 02:34.330
Today, you are doctors.

02:34.331 --> 02:38.501
(GIGGLING): Oh, my God,
it's so exciting, I just...

02:38.502 --> 02:40.378
This year will be the
hardest of your life.

02:40.379 --> 02:43.172
The learning curve is steep,
and the hours are demanding.

02:43.173 --> 02:44.715
Many residents don't survive.

02:44.716 --> 02:47.343
Some quit or, worse, become dentists.

02:47.344 --> 02:49.912
- (ALL GASP)
- Geez.

02:49.913 --> 02:51.004
You have a comment?

02:51.005 --> 02:52.029
I'm sorry.

02:52.030 --> 02:53.182
Did not mean to interrupt.

02:53.183 --> 02:54.558
It's just that fear is

02:54.559 --> 02:56.141
a terrible way to motivate people.

02:56.142 --> 02:57.911
I-I was a teacher, and I found that

02:57.912 --> 03:00.396
my students responded
best to encouragement.

03:00.397 --> 03:02.930
And, you know, neuroscience
is completely behind this. Oh.

03:02.931 --> 03:04.427
I read a great article in <i> The Lancet.</i>

03:04.428 --> 03:05.518
I will send it to you.

03:05.519 --> 03:06.927
You're gonna need my log-in.

03:06.928 --> 03:10.465
Username is CarolKenKen,
and password is MamaDoc63.

03:10.466 --> 03:11.658
I am your boss,

03:11.659 --> 03:13.233
not your friend.

03:13.234 --> 03:14.609
I'm here for two reasons:

03:14.610 --> 03:15.893
to teach you how to save lives

03:15.894 --> 03:17.752
and to determine which of you can cut it

03:17.753 --> 03:19.320
and which of you can't.

03:19.321 --> 03:21.063
Let's move.

03:21.064 --> 03:22.922
Was she looking at
me when she said that?

03:22.923 --> 03:25.300
She looked right at
me. Wow, she is fast.

03:26.866 --> 03:29.534
Ah, new crop of interns.

03:29.535 --> 03:32.871
Is it just me, or do they
get younger every year?

03:32.872 --> 03:35.207
Not just you, Dr. Frost.

03:35.208 --> 03:37.377
I think one of them brought their mom.

03:38.628 --> 03:40.212
♪♪

03:40.213 --> 03:41.546
(BEEP)

03:41.547 --> 03:43.215
Patient is a 38-year-old male,

03:43.216 --> 03:45.342
admitted four days after
a minor car accident,

03:45.343 --> 03:47.177
complaining of fatigue and headaches.

03:47.178 --> 03:50.389
What are his related
health factors, Dr. Sommers?

03:50.390 --> 03:52.057
Huh? Uh, bluh, di-di-di-dah.

03:52.058 --> 03:54.393
Uh, looks like a history of migraines?

03:54.394 --> 03:56.520
Correct. Next time, be prepared.

03:56.521 --> 03:58.449
She can't yell at what she can't see.

04:00.149 --> 04:01.525
You think his migraines

04:01.526 --> 04:03.235
have something to do with this?

04:03.236 --> 04:06.238
Here. Here you go. I
always carry a spare.

04:06.239 --> 04:09.776
Aw. The gel pen my neighbor
Phyllis got me in Japan.

04:12.578 --> 04:14.746
And how do your migraines
typically present?

04:14.747 --> 04:16.039
Dizziness.

04:16.040 --> 04:17.249
I get those flashy lights.

04:17.250 --> 04:18.416
Wh-What are they called?

04:18.418 --> 04:19.634
- Aur...
- Auras.

04:19.635 --> 04:21.067
Yeah, my uncle had migraines like that.

04:21.069 --> 04:23.427
They're commonly stress-related, and...

04:23.428 --> 04:25.215
Long story short,

04:25.216 --> 04:26.591
yoga helped him with his migraines

04:26.592 --> 04:29.470
but not with his
alcoholism, and he died.

04:31.055 --> 04:32.931
Next steps. Dr. Kutcher.

04:32.932 --> 04:35.600
Probable causes include
subdural hematoma,

04:35.601 --> 04:36.935
Chiari malformation.

04:36.936 --> 04:38.437
Start with a head CT and blood work.

04:38.438 --> 04:39.730
Excellent, Dr. Kutcher.

04:39.731 --> 04:42.941
That is how, and when,
to speak on rounds.

04:42.942 --> 04:44.109
Let's move.

04:44.110 --> 04:46.069
No, what did she say?

04:46.070 --> 04:48.572
Head CT? Is that a CAT scan?

04:48.573 --> 04:49.781
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:49.782 --> 04:51.007
CT is a CAT scan.

04:51.008 --> 04:52.399
You'll have the results this afternoon.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.286
Oh, thanks. Sorry, I'm a mess.

04:54.287 --> 04:55.579
This has been stressful.

04:55.580 --> 04:57.031
Oh, of course it has.

04:57.032 --> 04:59.624
Uh, here. Need a hair tie?

04:59.625 --> 05:01.585
Yes.

05:01.586 --> 05:03.670
Thank you. What are
you, Dr. Mary Poppins?

05:03.671 --> 05:05.922
- (BOTH LAUGH)
- No.

05:05.923 --> 05:06.990
No, no, no.

05:06.991 --> 05:08.091
But if you need a tissue,

05:08.092 --> 05:10.969
I have Kleenex hidden all over my body.

05:10.970 --> 05:12.637
MAYA: Dr. Kenney!

05:12.638 --> 05:14.390
Sorry.

05:15.975 --> 05:17.851
Wow, rounds are intense.

05:17.852 --> 05:20.270
I feel like I've aged a thousand years.

05:20.271 --> 05:22.606
- No offense, Carol.
- (SCOFFS)

05:22.607 --> 05:24.316
You think that's intense?

05:24.317 --> 05:26.860
Try teaching 40 ninth-graders
how to dissect a frog.

05:26.861 --> 05:29.030
You'll find out who
the serial killers are.

05:30.656 --> 05:32.657
Anyone want an energy boost?

05:32.658 --> 05:33.825
Banana me.

05:33.826 --> 05:34.993
Daniel?

05:34.994 --> 05:36.787
No, thanks. I create my own energy.

05:36.788 --> 05:39.831
I'll take one.

05:39.832 --> 05:42.626
Guys, these are super fresh. Hyup!

05:42.627 --> 05:46.381
(SIGHS) I got them this morning
from a Whole Foods dumpster.

05:47.882 --> 05:50.675
That's okay. I'll get
something from the cafeteria.

05:50.676 --> 05:52.226
You better hurry. Dr. Jacobs said

05:52.227 --> 05:54.805
we had a two-minute break,
and that was 90 seconds ago.

05:54.806 --> 05:56.681
Ah, that's just an expression.

05:56.682 --> 05:58.016
She can't actually mean...

05:58.017 --> 05:59.684
Two minutes are up.

05:59.685 --> 06:01.983
I hope you feel rejuvenated,

06:01.984 --> 06:03.814
because I have your assignments.

06:03.815 --> 06:05.716
Dr. Sommers and Dr.
Gilani, you'll be assisting

06:05.717 --> 06:07.651
a senior attending on a patient workup.

06:07.652 --> 06:10.237
Wow, senior attending on
our first day. (CHUCKLES)

06:10.238 --> 06:12.364
Dr. Kutcher, excellent work on rounds.

06:12.365 --> 06:14.190
You'll do follow-up on Car Crash.

06:14.191 --> 06:17.236
My own patient? Yes, Danny!

06:20.206 --> 06:21.883
Dr. Kenney,

06:21.884 --> 06:23.708
you'll be collecting stool samples.

06:23.709 --> 06:26.182
Stool samples?

06:26.183 --> 06:27.587
Oh, hey.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.423
Uh, you know,

06:29.424 --> 06:31.174
maybe I could assist Dr. Kutcher.

06:31.175 --> 06:33.250
I had a really good rapport
with his patient's wife.

06:33.251 --> 06:35.220
No, thanks. Danny's good.

06:35.221 --> 06:37.931
(SIGHS) Oh, I saw on
the white board there was

06:37.932 --> 06:40.516
a patient with a secondary
infection, and I am very in...

06:40.517 --> 06:42.432
Dr. Kenney...

06:42.433 --> 06:44.768
I realize you're excited to be here

06:44.769 --> 06:47.170
at this late stage of your life,

06:47.171 --> 06:50.280
but this is how hospitals work.

06:50.281 --> 06:51.639
There's a chain of command.

06:51.640 --> 06:53.331
When a senior doctor gives an order,

06:53.332 --> 06:54.856
a junior doctor follows it.

06:54.857 --> 06:58.592
So, let's try this again.

06:58.593 --> 07:01.661
Dr. Kenney, you'll be
collecting stool samples.

07:01.662 --> 07:03.956
Yes, Carol!

07:08.993 --> 07:12.555
Well, Mr. Bans is on the morphine
choo choo to sleepy town,

07:12.556 --> 07:13.758
- so I guess we just... What's that?!
- (BEEPING)

07:13.759 --> 07:15.292
What did I do? What
did I do? What did I do?

07:15.293 --> 07:16.469
Oh, it's me.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.095
(SIGHS)

07:18.096 --> 07:21.182
Oh, today is so stressful, huh?

07:21.183 --> 07:23.267
I mean, we're the doctors now.

07:23.268 --> 07:25.255
If se screw up, someone could die.

07:25.256 --> 07:27.772
- What's that?
- BOTH: Go to sleep, Mr. Bans.

07:27.773 --> 07:29.106
Shh.

07:29.107 --> 07:30.775
I'm just glad I got paired with you.

07:30.776 --> 07:33.042
You seem pretty cool, aside
from eating trash food.

07:33.043 --> 07:35.321
(CHUCKLING): Aw.
You're my favorite, too.

07:35.322 --> 07:37.657
I'm the first person in
my family to go to college,

07:37.658 --> 07:40.584
much less be a doctor, so
I feel this crazy pressure

07:40.585 --> 07:41.619
to do well.

07:41.620 --> 07:43.287
I get it.

07:43.288 --> 07:45.456
I don't need to walk
a mile in your shoes,

07:45.457 --> 07:46.999
because I own your shoes,

07:47.000 --> 07:48.877
and I'm wearing them right now.

07:49.961 --> 07:51.671
Wh-What I'm trying to say is...

07:51.672 --> 07:53.465
is that we're the same.

07:54.883 --> 07:57.635
Hello! Dr. Stephen
Frost. Senior attending.

07:57.636 --> 07:59.470
Department chair. Please...

07:59.471 --> 08:01.749
- hold your applause.
- Dr. Frost, it's an honor.

08:01.750 --> 08:04.266
- My name is Doctor...
- And look who's here.

08:04.267 --> 08:06.686
Caleb, how are you, kiddo?

08:06.687 --> 08:08.479
Stephen! (LAUGHS)

08:08.480 --> 08:10.439
I-I mean, uh, Dr. Frost.

08:10.440 --> 08:13.317
Uh, I didn't realize that
you were the senior attending.

08:13.318 --> 08:14.818
- You two know each other?
- Know each other?

08:14.819 --> 08:17.446
I've been friends with
the Sommers forever.

08:17.447 --> 08:20.782
I taught this little guy how to ski.

08:20.783 --> 08:23.159
Pizza pie. French fries. Pizza pie.

08:23.160 --> 08:25.954
Come here, you. Oh, I got you!

08:25.955 --> 08:29.999

08:41.679 --> 08:44.179
Good to see you, Dr. Sommers.

08:44.181 --> 08:46.934
And nice meeting you, Caleb's friend.

08:49.728 --> 08:50.771
What?

08:51.730 --> 08:52.814
What?

08:52.815 --> 08:54.315
Where I come from,

08:54.316 --> 08:56.944

Oh, Doctor. Excuse me, Doctor?

09:01.865 --> 09:04.158
Oh. Oh, wow.

09:04.159 --> 09:06.909
You mean me. (LAUGHS)

09:06.910 --> 09:09.872
That is so nice to hear. "Doctor".

09:09.873 --> 09:11.207
Can you please help us?

09:11.208 --> 09:13.167
No, I can't. I'm sorry.

09:13.168 --> 09:14.768
You're Dr. Kutcher's patient.

09:14.769 --> 09:17.772
See, there's this whole
hierarchy about who does what,

09:17.773 --> 09:19.346
and it sounds so silly,

09:19.347 --> 09:21.718
but I could get in a ton
of trouble if I help you.

09:21.719 --> 09:23.219
Although, why did I become a doctor?

09:23.220 --> 09:24.554
To help people.

09:24.555 --> 09:27.036
Nice people who call me "doctor".

09:33.063 --> 09:35.064
So, what's on your mind?

09:35.065 --> 09:37.567
Is his I.V. in right?
He kind of rolled over.

09:37.568 --> 09:40.817
Yeah, that looks fine. Has
he been scratching at it?

09:40.818 --> 09:42.572
Yeah, he's been really itchy.

09:42.573 --> 09:45.408
Itchy? When did you first notice that?

09:45.409 --> 09:46.909
A month or so ago.

09:46.910 --> 09:48.870
So, before the accident?

09:48.871 --> 09:50.413
And the migraines, were those also...

09:50.414 --> 09:51.538
DANIEL: Thanks, Nurse.
I'll get right in.

09:51.539 --> 09:53.083
Um, I was never here.

Look, the patient's

You know, I think there's something more

10:38.962 --> 10:40.129

I was trying to help...

11:22.673 --> 11:24.507
You can help by following orders.

11:24.508 --> 11:26.808
Yes, I made a mistake, but I...

11:26.809 --> 11:28.803
Dr. Kenney, this isn't
about one mistake.

11:28.804 --> 11:30.013
This is about you.

11:30.014 --> 11:31.347
Being a doctor's not an item

11:31.348 --> 11:32.849

- Ooh.

11:34.342 --> 11:35.810
Someone who can't follow orders

11:35.811 --> 11:37.646
is someone who can't be a good doctor.

11:39.565 --> 11:42.401
I-I don't even have a bucket list.

11:43.402 --> 11:45.361

I would never say that.
It's cultural appropriation.

12:54.136 --> 12:56.351

for, I would be all over it.

13:38.594 --> 13:40.391
Yeah. Dr. Jacobs confirmed it.

13:40.392 --> 13:41.809
Mm.

13:41.810 --> 13:43.185
You knew, though.

13:43.186 --> 13:46.032
Well, I suspected, based
on what his wife told me,

13:46.033 --> 13:47.481
but I wasn't sure.

13:47.482 --> 13:49.984
I wish I was wrong. Does he know?

13:49.985 --> 13:51.902
Dr. Jacobs told me to tell him.

13:51.903 --> 13:54.864
I don't know how. This is my first day.

13:54.865 --> 13:58.617
I thought I'd save at least six lives.

13:58.618 --> 14:00.828

14:00.829 --> 14:03.131
"Bad news, dude, it's the big C."

14:03.132 --> 14:06.060
Uh, no. Not like that, no.

14:08.170 --> 14:10.838
Be honest, but be kind.

14:10.839 --> 14:14.050
You know, people beat
this, so give them hope.

14:14.051 --> 14:15.676
That's good.

14:15.677 --> 14:16.927
That's good advice.

14:16.928 --> 14:18.169
Okay.

14:18.170 --> 14:20.571
- Will you tell him?
- No.

14:20.572 --> 14:24.518
No. I've been given strict
orders to stay in my lane, so...

14:24.519 --> 14:25.853
Look, you've got this.

14:25.854 --> 14:27.688
Just draw from your own experience.

that's ever happened to you?

That's a lot of fluid.

Your dad will be so proud.

14:54.913 --> 14:57.722
- I'm gonna send him a picture of this.
- Um...

14:57.723 --> 15:01.043
Or maybe I give it to him at Christmas.

15:01.044 --> 15:05.349
It was actually Dr. Gilani,
sir, who led the procedure.

15:05.350 --> 15:08.568
Oh. Well, then, nice work, Dr. Gilani.

15:08.569 --> 15:10.302

like this for Christmas?

Uh, no, thank you. They
already have so many.

had to pull some strings.

15:35.912 --> 15:38.497
That's what I meant when
I said that we're the same.

15:38.498 --> 15:43.086
You're afraid that you
don't belong, and so am I.

Dr. Kenney.

16:44.925 --> 16:46.449
You spoke to Daniel's patient.

16:46.450 --> 16:48.419
Okay, you know what?

16:48.420 --> 16:50.546
I am getting tired of being treated

16:50.547 --> 16:52.699
like a meddling old lady.

16:52.700 --> 16:55.745
I am a meddling old doctor.

16:57.066 --> 16:59.317
Okay, yes, I have made some mistakes,

16:59.318 --> 17:00.760
and if you want to kick me out, fine.

17:00.761 --> 17:02.854
But Daniel's patient
needed me, and I am not

17:02.855 --> 17:05.231
going to apologize for
helping. I was good at it.

17:05.232 --> 17:07.701
- Dr. Kenney, you...
- And I'm good at it because I'm old.

17:07.702 --> 17:08.703
Yeah.

17:10.121 --> 17:11.663
You think a woman my age

17:11.664 --> 17:14.540
should just disappear
into the woods and knit.

17:14.541 --> 17:16.334
But I see the world

17:16.335 --> 17:18.336
in a different way than when I was 28.

17:18.337 --> 17:21.089
I know that life doesn't work
out the way you want it to.

17:21.089 --> 17:22.690
I know that at least one of your kids

17:22.691 --> 17:24.108
is gonna be a disappointment.

17:25.678 --> 17:27.137
I know all kinds of stuff

17:27.137 --> 17:29.097
that you won't know
for another 20 years.

17:29.098 --> 17:33.143
And guess what, my age is what's
gonna make me a great doctor.

- Are you done?
- Am I done? I am just getting started.

17:36.134 --> 17:37.605

you disobeyed orders,

This last six seconds has shown
me a completely new side of you.

strict? I bet they never

- Nope.
- No, really...

18:21.525 --> 18:23.734
It's such a shame. Expecting perfection

can really hinder a child's development.

is behind that, too.

18:52.556 --> 18:55.225
I'm the old intern.
Your local circus freak.

18:55.226 --> 18:57.160
Put me on a train and
show me to America.

18:57.161 --> 18:59.396
(LAUGHS) No.

18:59.397 --> 19:02.440
I mean, yes, your age is unusual,

19:02.441 --> 19:04.943
but you're also the intern who...

19:04.944 --> 19:07.070
Oh, who Dr. Jacobs
hates. Yes, that's me.

19:07.071 --> 19:09.846
I was gonna say "who
triggered the code blue".

19:09.847 --> 19:11.950
I see I've made a
great first impression.

19:11.951 --> 19:15.078
Well, you've made this
place much more exciting.

19:15.079 --> 19:17.060
- (CHUCKLES)
- All the life-and-death stuff

19:17.061 --> 19:19.374
was getting a little blah.

19:19.375 --> 19:21.709
(LAUGHS)

19:21.710 --> 19:25.047
Can I buy you that parfait?
Purely out of respect.

19:26.163 --> 19:28.591
Yes, Dr. Frost, you can buy me a yogurt.

19:28.592 --> 19:31.427
But have you seen an intern's salary?

19:31.428 --> 19:33.889
It's disgraceful. Do you mind
if I get four? They're small.

19:37.273 --> 19:39.107
Thank you for getting us back on track

19:39.108 --> 19:42.611
with your teacher mind games.
We learned a valuable lesson...

19:42.612 --> 19:43.737
You're burying the lede.

19:43.738 --> 19:45.405
Caleb got in off the wait list.

19:45.406 --> 19:47.407
- Oh, that's great.
- (LAUGHS)

19:47.408 --> 19:48.784
Can I join you?

19:48.785 --> 19:51.286
Ooh, look at Daniel, respecting Carol.

19:51.287 --> 19:53.331
Carol, because she is very old...

19:54.707 --> 19:56.583
... brings great wisdom to our group.

19:56.584 --> 19:58.669
- Like a village elder...
- CAROL: Thank you, Daniel.

19:58.670 --> 19:59.837
I accept your apology.

19:59.838 --> 20:01.797
Oh, there you are.

20:01.798 --> 20:03.298
- (SCREAMS)
- (SCREAMS)

20:03.299 --> 20:05.133
- What's happening?
- (BOTH SCREAM)

20:05.134 --> 20:06.625
Oh, they know each other.

20:06.626 --> 20:07.970
Hi, Mom.

20:07.971 --> 20:09.578
- Mom?
- CAROL: Oh, hi, honey.

20:09.579 --> 20:11.922
- I didn't know you worked at Loyola on Tuesdays.
- I don't.

20:11.923 --> 20:13.642
I switched shifts just so I can see you

20:13.643 --> 20:14.793
on your very first day.

20:14.794 --> 20:18.048
Oh, my gosh, look at
you in your doctor coat.

20:18.049 --> 20:19.439
- I know, right?
- (GASPS)

20:19.440 --> 20:21.483
- I'm so proud of you, Mom.
- Aw, thank you.

20:21.484 --> 20:22.860
CAROL: Um, everyone,

20:22.861 --> 20:24.458
this is my daughter Jenny.

20:24.459 --> 20:25.545
She's a pharma rep.

20:25.546 --> 20:27.823
- Jenny, this is everyone.
- <i>Enchanté.</i>

20:27.824 --> 20:30.951
That's French, and yes, I speak it.

20:30.952 --> 20:33.328
Oh.<i> Hola, señor.</i>

20:33.329 --> 20:35.706
<i>¿Dónde está la biblioteca?</i>

20:35.707 --> 20:37.767
Uh,<i> el hospital no tiene una biblioteca.</i>

20:38.668 --> 20:41.545
I quit after a year.

20:41.546 --> 20:43.547
Okay. Honey, can you stay?

20:43.548 --> 20:45.382
Ugh, I wish. I got to work.

20:45.383 --> 20:47.694
These boner pills aren't
gonna sell themselves.

20:48.970 --> 20:50.470
- I'm so proud of you.
- Aw.

20:50.471 --> 20:53.348
Okay. Text me later. Bye, Mom's friends.

20:53.349 --> 20:55.893
(CHUCKLES) Carol...

20:55.894 --> 20:57.695
Don't even think about it.

20:57.696 --> 20:59.187
I understand that you wouldn't want

20:59.188 --> 21:00.680
your daughter to date him, but...

21:00.681 --> 21:02.024
Nope. Not you, either.

21:02.025 --> 21:03.692
You guys are disgusting.

21:03.693 --> 21:05.694
Fine, Carol, I'll date your daughter.

21:05.695 --> 21:09.281
Nobody dates my daughter.
You understand?

21:09.282 --> 21:10.908
Tell me you understand.

21:10.909 --> 21:12.284
(SIGHING)

21:12.285 --> 21:14.244
ALL: We understand, Carol.

21:14.245 --> 21:15.704
Thank you.

21:15.705 --> 21:17.222
Daniel, put your napkin in your lap.
