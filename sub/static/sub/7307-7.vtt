WEBVTT

00:07.265 --> 00:11.512
- I cannot believe they lost.
- I can't believe you gave me six points.

00:12.019 --> 00:13.247
So what do you got for me today?

00:13.271 --> 00:16.437
- Just these drums here.
- All righty, sweet cheeks.

00:32.790 --> 00:34.498
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:41.465 --> 00:44.585
Oh, man, I'm going
to be cleaning up this mess for days.

00:45.386 --> 00:47.046
What the hell is that?

01:34.176 --> 01:35.587
Should I hose him off, or...

01:35.678 --> 01:38.429
No, the best thing
is for you to do nothing.

01:38.514 --> 01:39.593
Okay, Agent McGee?

01:39.682 --> 01:41.758
Just secure the area
and wait for us to get there.

01:41.851 --> 01:43.096
Then I'll wait.

01:43.185 --> 01:44.264
Okay.

01:45.271 --> 01:48.106
Case agent at Norfolk
sounds pretty green.

01:53.112 --> 01:56.362
- You look like hell.
- A woman loves to hear that, Tony.

01:56.574 --> 02:00.322
If you're coming down with something,
don't sit next to me in the truck.

02:00.411 --> 02:04.076
- There's an upside to having a cold.
- You want to tell the doctor about it?

02:04.164 --> 02:05.956
You guys ready to go?

02:07.418 --> 02:09.291
All set. Yeah.

02:09.377 --> 02:12.296
And Ducky and Jackson
are already on their way.

02:13.799 --> 02:15.128
Oh, God.

02:15.634 --> 02:17.461
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

02:20.472 --> 02:21.504
I...

02:21.932 --> 02:23.925
What do you put in your coffee?

02:24.143 --> 02:25.174
Coffee.

02:25.269 --> 02:28.389
Okay, I'll just go down the hall,
and get you another cup.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.687
That's not coffee.

02:39.825 --> 02:41.367
Meet you in the truck.

02:43.037 --> 02:46.203
I've never experienced Gibbs
without his morning coffee.

02:47.166 --> 02:49.408
We're in uncharted waters here, Kate.

02:54.632 --> 02:57.419
Yeah, there are multiple purposes

02:57.509 --> 03:00.083
for hydrofluoric acid on a naval base.

03:00.220 --> 03:03.589
It's most commonly used
to surface-clean metal.

03:03.807 --> 03:06.808
It's highly corrosive,
readily penetrates human skin,

03:06.894 --> 03:09.848
destroying soft tissue
and decalcifying bone.

03:10.230 --> 03:14.145
And from the look of this fellow,
I'd say he wasn't in that drum very long.

03:14.234 --> 03:17.070
I'd venture less than 24 hours.

03:17.196 --> 03:20.031
The worst case
of acid indigestion I've ever seen.

03:21.367 --> 03:26.278
Hey, better get Michael Jackson
out of here before he ralphs.

03:26.538 --> 03:29.029
Come on, McGee, help me take
measurements for the sketches.

03:29.124 --> 03:32.825
- He wearing crackerjacks, Doc?
- Yeah, definitely enlisted.

03:34.421 --> 03:38.086
We're not going to get fingerprints,
but on the left forearm

03:38.217 --> 03:42.380
a bit of skin attached
and some discoloration.

03:43.430 --> 03:45.423
- A birthmark?
- Possibly.

03:45.516 --> 03:47.923
I'll be able to tell more
when I get him home.

03:48.018 --> 03:50.474
The Armed Forces DNA registry
can get us a match.

03:50.562 --> 03:54.430
They're backlogged. I wouldn't count on
anything for at least 48 hours.

04:06.954 --> 04:09.160
I've heard stories
about Special Agent Gibbs.

04:09.248 --> 04:12.948
Only half of them are true.
The trick is figuring out which half.

04:20.341 --> 04:23.012
With inspection procedures
as tight as they are,

04:23.095 --> 04:24.506
probably murdered on base.

04:24.596 --> 04:27.170
They didn't get him past us
in the trunk of a car.

04:27.266 --> 04:29.577
Which means he had to be murdered
by someone with clearance.

04:29.601 --> 04:32.009
- Yes, sir.
- Anyone reported missing?

04:32.104 --> 04:33.248
Save the whales! Stop sonar testing!

04:33.272 --> 04:36.723
We had a UA seaman last week,
but he was picked up at his home.

04:37.526 --> 04:39.020
Whale huggers?

04:39.111 --> 04:41.353
Yes, sir.
They've been bugging us for weeks.

04:41.447 --> 04:42.727
Why don't you just shoot them?

04:42.823 --> 04:46.239
- Save the whales! Stop sonar testing!
- I've been tempted.

04:46.326 --> 04:47.821
Save the whales!

04:49.371 --> 04:52.372
We have to keep the crime scene
under guard until it's released by Gibbs.

04:52.458 --> 04:53.868
I'll let security know.

04:53.959 --> 04:56.913
Gibbs wants NCIS to remain in control.

04:57.421 --> 04:59.912
So, I should stay here?

05:01.592 --> 05:03.999
We'll get you relieved
as soon as we can.

05:05.888 --> 05:06.967
Okay.

05:10.434 --> 05:13.269
- Why are you making him stay here?
- Because I can.

05:13.353 --> 05:15.061
That is complete abuse of authority.

05:15.147 --> 05:18.231
Lighten up. He's new. He expects
to be abused. It goes with the territory.

05:18.317 --> 05:20.440
This isn't pledge week
at Sigma Chi, Tony.

05:20.527 --> 05:22.769
Bet you were a lot of fun in college.

05:23.113 --> 05:25.070
I was a lot of fun in college.

05:26.617 --> 05:27.815
Really?

05:30.746 --> 05:34.245
Fortunately, your facial bone structure
is intact.

05:34.458 --> 05:38.242
With these photos,
Abby will be able to build

05:38.420 --> 05:40.045
a computer model.

05:40.130 --> 05:42.965
Not a model
you'd want on your mantelpiece,

05:44.259 --> 05:46.003
but she'll do the best she can.

05:47.513 --> 05:49.589
Abby's getting Gibbs on the line.

05:50.265 --> 05:51.925
- Would you?
- Sure.

05:54.478 --> 05:56.636
- Good morning, guys.
- Where's Ducky?

05:57.314 --> 05:59.639
- Right here, Jethro.
- Got a name?

06:00.234 --> 06:02.226
We're good, but we're not that good.

06:02.319 --> 06:04.146
Well, what do you got that's good, Doc?

06:04.238 --> 06:06.610
Death was from blunt force injury.

06:06.698 --> 06:09.236
There's a fracture
to the rear of the skull.

06:09.660 --> 06:10.691
That's it?

06:10.786 --> 06:13.906
No. Remember that
discoloration on the forearm

06:13.997 --> 06:16.286
we thought might be a birthmark?

06:16.375 --> 06:17.655
Well, it wasn't.

06:17.751 --> 06:19.660
I digitally enhanced it. Watch.

06:24.007 --> 06:25.965
Looks like a Rorschach test.

06:26.051 --> 06:29.005
It's part of a tattoo
that was blurred by the acid.

06:29.471 --> 06:33.054
- What is that?
- That is the tail of a dolphin.

06:33.392 --> 06:36.843
- Our victim was a submariner.
- Well, it would be a good guess.

06:36.937 --> 06:39.428
You know, the history
of tattooing is fascinating.

06:39.523 --> 06:42.144
- Egyptian...
- How many subs in port?

06:42.234 --> 06:45.603
I'm copied
on the daily movement report.

06:45.946 --> 06:48.519
Preserved mummy.
A woman of Thebes,

06:48.782 --> 06:51.024
yes, whose tomb indicates
that she was...

06:51.118 --> 06:53.525
Interesting filing system, McGee.

06:53.871 --> 06:55.199
A priestess...

06:56.957 --> 06:59.495
Three Los Angeles-class attack subs
in port at the moment,

06:59.585 --> 07:00.747
another in dry dock.

07:00.836 --> 07:04.205
There were five, but
the Philadelphia left at 0600.

07:04.298 --> 07:06.089
Get me copies
of the ships' alpha rosters.

07:06.175 --> 07:07.254
I'm on it.

07:07.342 --> 07:09.584
Around the pelvic region,
below the navel.

07:09.678 --> 07:13.462
Now, this nonrepresentational
geometric style of tattooing...

07:15.142 --> 07:18.807
What if the body was put into acid,
not only to dispose of it, but to...

07:18.896 --> 07:21.054
But to make certain
that it couldn't be identified?

07:21.148 --> 07:24.184
Maybe the murderer didn't want
us to know the submariner was dead.

07:24.276 --> 07:27.976
- Maybe.
- Agent Gibbs. The alpha rosters.

07:28.155 --> 07:30.990
Everyone on these sub crews
is accounted for.

07:31.408 --> 07:33.733
- Including the Philadelphia?
- Yes, sir.

07:34.620 --> 07:37.989
A submariner is dead,
but none are missing.

07:40.083 --> 07:42.409
And the dead man's identity
was removed.

07:44.588 --> 07:47.126
Someone took his place
on one of those subs.

07:47.507 --> 07:48.966
An impostor?

07:49.343 --> 07:51.964
Let's pay a visit
to the submarine squadron commander.

07:52.054 --> 07:54.461
You'll wanna avoid Captain Veitch.

07:54.806 --> 07:55.921
What?

07:57.809 --> 08:00.051
Well, I met him once before.

08:01.063 --> 08:03.221
He can be very difficult.

08:05.400 --> 08:08.188
And you don't think
that I can be difficult?

08:08.987 --> 08:10.861
I'm sure you can, sir.

08:21.625 --> 08:24.958
You're telling me somebody killed
one of my sub crew members

08:25.045 --> 08:26.836
to take his place?

08:28.006 --> 08:30.414
I think there's a very real possibility.

08:30.926 --> 08:32.385
Not on my watch, Agent Gibbs.

08:32.469 --> 08:34.592
Can you take that chance, Captain?

08:35.681 --> 08:37.756
It would have to be someone new.

08:39.934 --> 08:41.179
Humour me.

08:43.145 --> 08:44.475
All right.

08:44.564 --> 08:46.937
I'll beef up security
around the boats in port.

08:47.025 --> 08:48.733
Have every new crew member's
I.D. Card

08:48.819 --> 08:50.776
checked against their service record.

08:50.862 --> 08:52.357
What about the Philadelphia?

08:52.447 --> 08:55.365
- She's a day out.
- I think you should call her back.

08:55.534 --> 08:57.526
Agent Gibbs,
the Philadelphia is en route to join

08:57.619 --> 08:59.695
a NATO exercise in the Atlantic,

08:59.788 --> 09:04.082
and your theory is highly speculative,

09:04.167 --> 09:05.911
if not preposterous.

09:06.378 --> 09:08.252
I'm not about to bring her back.

09:08.338 --> 09:11.541
Then send Special Agent Todd and me
to rendezvous with her

09:12.551 --> 09:14.709
and interview the new crew members.

09:15.554 --> 09:18.092
Well, the presence of a woman
aboard a submarine

09:18.181 --> 09:20.719
is a tremendous inconvenience.

09:21.226 --> 09:23.219
- You know that.
- I do.

09:24.604 --> 09:28.139
Don't you have another agent
that you can take with you?

09:28.233 --> 09:29.312
I do.

09:30.652 --> 09:31.933
Kate, step out.

09:43.290 --> 09:45.615
- I'm glad you understand.
- I don't.

09:45.709 --> 09:46.788
Excuse me?

09:46.877 --> 09:49.284
Don't tell me
how to run an investigation.

09:49.463 --> 09:51.835
Yeah, I've got other agents
who could do the job,

09:51.923 --> 09:54.331
but none as well as Special Agent Todd.

09:54.426 --> 09:58.293
Formerly, she was attached
to the president's Secret Service detail,

09:58.388 --> 09:59.633
trained as a profiler.

09:59.723 --> 10:02.593
I don't care what she was trained for.
She's a woman,

10:02.684 --> 10:05.970
and females cannot be deployed
on a submarine.

10:08.315 --> 10:10.640
Chief Patterson,
report to machine room.

10:10.984 --> 10:12.858
Chief Patterson,
report to machine room.

10:12.944 --> 10:14.487
What is this, Victorian England?

10:14.571 --> 10:16.314
The men with their cigars and brandy,

10:16.406 --> 10:18.446
while the ladies
sip tea in another room?

10:18.533 --> 10:21.285
I'm more qualified for this investigation
than Tony.

10:21.370 --> 10:25.070
To replace me because I shave my legs
and not my face is unconscionable

10:25.165 --> 10:27.143
and certainly not
in the best interest of the case.

10:27.167 --> 10:29.160
- You claustrophobic?
- No.

10:29.336 --> 10:30.415
Good!

10:31.797 --> 10:33.125
I'm going?

10:36.885 --> 10:38.676
Don't forget to wax.

10:48.263 --> 10:51.098
I think I'm more excited
to dive on a nuclear sub

10:51.182 --> 10:52.842
than I was flying Air Force One.

10:52.934 --> 10:56.434
See if you're still as excited
by the time we get there.

11:03.194 --> 11:07.358
Special Agent Gibbs, Special Agent
Todd, welcome to the Enterprise.

11:07.449 --> 11:09.940
Sorry your stay's so short.
Your helo's standing by.

11:12.078 --> 11:15.827
How do we get from the frigate
to the submarine, swim?

11:16.916 --> 11:18.079
Close.

11:26.343 --> 11:28.335
I don't see a submarine.

11:34.184 --> 11:35.892
You see it now?

11:39.481 --> 11:41.806
Deck is clear. Hatch secure.

11:41.983 --> 11:44.984
Submerge the boat.
Make depth 250 feet.

11:45.153 --> 11:48.771
Submerge the boat.
Make our depth 250 feet.

11:48.865 --> 11:53.029
Chief of the watch on the 1-MC.
Dive, dive.

11:53.411 --> 11:55.653
Dive, dive, dive.

12:02.545 --> 12:05.167
250 feet and passing.

12:09.427 --> 12:12.547
Welcome aboard the Philadelphia.
I'm Commander Peters.

12:12.639 --> 12:14.299
This is my XO,
Lieutenant Commander Akron.

12:14.391 --> 12:15.505
Sir.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.806
Special Agent Gibbs.
Special Agent Todd.

12:17.894 --> 12:21.061
- Can I help you with that, ma'am?
- No, I'm good.

12:21.981 --> 12:24.935
Why don't we go to the wardroom?
XO, take the con.

12:25.026 --> 12:27.315
Aye, aye, Skipper. COB, I have the con.

12:27.904 --> 12:32.281
I've quarantined the five men
as requested. They said you'd fill me in.

12:32.992 --> 12:34.652
Fill me in, Special Agent Gibbs.

12:34.744 --> 12:37.282
One of those men
may not be who he says he is.

12:37.372 --> 12:38.914
I find that hard to believe.

12:38.998 --> 12:40.790
A body was found at Norfolk.

12:40.959 --> 12:43.746
It was made unidentifiable,
possibly on purpose.

12:43.837 --> 12:47.336
We have good reason
to believe that he was a submariner.

12:48.007 --> 12:49.751
Fifteen of your crew are new.

12:49.843 --> 12:51.586
Four have been eliminated
by dental x-rays.

12:51.678 --> 12:54.548
Six can be ruled out
because of ethnic origin or body type.

12:54.639 --> 12:55.920
That's it?

12:56.099 --> 12:58.554
Your conclusions
are based on supposition.

12:58.643 --> 12:59.722
Strong suppositions.

12:59.811 --> 13:01.934
I interviewed every one of
those men when they boarded

13:02.021 --> 13:05.390
and examined their personnel files
before they ever set foot on this boat.

13:05.483 --> 13:07.169
We would like that same opportunity,
Skipper.

13:07.193 --> 13:09.601
You'll get your interviews, Agent Gibbs,

13:09.696 --> 13:10.976
but you need to understand

13:11.072 --> 13:14.275
this boat's about to commence
an ASW exercise.

13:15.326 --> 13:17.200
Anti-submarine warfare.

13:17.579 --> 13:20.864
Enemy sub tries to infiltrate
the carrier battle group.

13:20.957 --> 13:24.871
We're tasked with intercepting
and destroying it. Theoretically, anyway.

13:24.961 --> 13:28.081
- One of our subs plays the enemy?
- The Augusta.

13:28.173 --> 13:32.005
Her skipper and I have a bottle of Stoli
riding on who wins.

13:32.135 --> 13:35.718
So you can see why I want those five
men back at their duty stations, ASAP.

13:35.805 --> 13:38.094
Well, we have a better reason
for keeping one of those men

13:38.183 --> 13:39.807
out of their duty stations, Skipper.

13:39.893 --> 13:41.719
I'd like the COB, for security purposes,

13:41.811 --> 13:44.385
to keep the men
from talking to each other.

13:44.481 --> 13:46.189
That's affirmative.

13:52.906 --> 13:53.985
COB.

13:54.616 --> 13:56.941
- The chief of the boat.
- Thank you.

13:57.911 --> 13:59.191
Welcome.

14:13.510 --> 14:14.541
It's coming along.

14:14.636 --> 14:18.301
Yeah, looks like he's going to be kind of
a hunk. He's got a good, strong chin.

14:18.389 --> 14:21.225
I agree. Sort of Cary Grant-ish.

14:23.061 --> 14:25.350
I was thinking more Hugh Grant-ish.

14:26.356 --> 14:28.147
Any luck with his stomach contents?

14:28.233 --> 14:30.937
Well, there's good news and bad news.

14:31.027 --> 14:34.147
I hate it when you play this game, Abby.
All right, let's get it over with.

14:34.239 --> 14:36.231
His last meal was a Big Mac and fries.

14:36.324 --> 14:38.205
Well, probably half the
base had that for lunch.

14:38.284 --> 14:40.858
I was hoping you'd come up
with something a little more exotic.

14:40.954 --> 14:44.572
Tandoori, perhaps. And the good news?

14:46.042 --> 14:48.284
I know what's in the special sauce.

14:57.303 --> 14:58.501
Enter.

15:01.266 --> 15:04.053
- Petty Officer Drew?
- Yes, sir.

15:04.978 --> 15:07.101
- Have a seat.
- Yes, sir.

15:09.274 --> 15:11.978
Would you give us
your right thumbprint, please?

15:13.278 --> 15:16.148
That would be your other
right thumb, Petty Officer.

15:19.033 --> 15:21.703
Sorry, sir. I'm a little nervous.

15:23.121 --> 15:25.279
It says here you're from Boston.

15:25.373 --> 15:28.208
- South Boston, actually, sir.
- There's a difference?

15:28.293 --> 15:30.700
Well, if you're from Boston there is.

15:32.589 --> 15:36.123
You just, joined this ship from the...

15:36.217 --> 15:37.498
The Topeka, sir.

15:37.844 --> 15:40.169
SSN 754. Out of San Diego.

15:40.847 --> 15:42.471
Did you request sonar?

15:42.557 --> 15:45.511
Yes, ma'am.
I talked to the recruiter about it.

15:45.685 --> 15:47.843
I've always been into electronics.

15:48.479 --> 15:51.350
I built my own guitar amp
when I was a kid.

15:52.358 --> 15:55.727
You enlisted when you were 19,
Petty Officer Thompson?

15:55.820 --> 15:57.231
Right out of high school, sir.

15:57.322 --> 15:59.943
Nineteen.
That's old to graduate high school.

16:02.952 --> 16:06.902
I got mono. Was home my junior year.
They put me back.

16:08.917 --> 16:10.826
May I ask what this is about?

16:11.419 --> 16:12.450
No.

16:14.839 --> 16:16.796
I need your thumbprint, please.

16:22.430 --> 16:25.051
- What'd they ask you?
- Stupid stuff. About my high school.

16:25.141 --> 16:26.172
Thompson!

16:27.435 --> 16:31.053
You heard the man.
There is no discussing your interview.

16:31.356 --> 16:32.850
Aye, aye, COB.

16:37.487 --> 16:41.567
Petty Officer Thompson was lying
about graduating high school at 19.

16:41.658 --> 16:43.449
He paused and looked to his left.

16:43.534 --> 16:45.741
Usually means
the response is fabricated.

16:45.828 --> 16:47.890
If he would've looked to his right,
he'd be recalling

16:47.914 --> 16:49.538
- a memory.
- A memory.

16:50.124 --> 16:51.749
You've had profile training.

16:51.834 --> 16:53.874
What I've had
is about a thousand interviews.

16:53.962 --> 16:56.120
After awhile
you start picking up on things.

16:56.214 --> 16:57.957
Why would Thompson
lie about his age?

16:58.049 --> 17:01.299
I don't know. Why did Seaman Riggs
lie about being married?

17:02.220 --> 17:04.758
Why did Petty Officer Drew
lie about a year in college?

17:04.847 --> 17:09.176
Well, maybe Riggs is secretly married
and Drew never finished a full year.

17:09.602 --> 17:11.973
Everybody has something to lie about.

17:13.481 --> 17:15.604
Which means we have nothing.

17:20.238 --> 17:23.856
- Sonar, still no sign of Augusta?
- No joy, sir.

17:23.950 --> 17:26.819
- Let's come about for another pass.
- Aye, aye, sir.

17:27.537 --> 17:29.992
I understand
you've completed your interviews.

17:30.081 --> 17:32.702
- For now.
- I need them at their duty stations.

17:32.792 --> 17:35.081
I'm concerned
about the safety of your boat, Skipper.

17:35.169 --> 17:36.961
Your concern will be noted.

17:37.046 --> 17:39.584
XO, have the COB
return the men to duty.

17:39.757 --> 17:41.299
Aye, aye, Skipper.

17:41.467 --> 17:44.219
How could someone harm this boat
from the inside?

17:44.303 --> 17:46.592
We're vulnerable
to any number of things.

17:46.681 --> 17:50.429
Chlorine introduced to the re-circulated
air could be fatal to the crew.

17:50.518 --> 17:53.305
Saltwater in the battery compartment
could cause an explosion.

17:53.396 --> 17:55.721
The missiles and torpedoes
are obvious dangers.

17:55.815 --> 17:57.724
I could go on, but what's the point?

17:57.817 --> 18:00.688
The point is that one of those men
may be an intruder.

18:01.070 --> 18:04.688
I don't believe that to be the case.
I trust every man on this crew.

18:04.782 --> 18:07.783
I'll make arrangements
to get you back to the carrier.

18:09.328 --> 18:10.953
We'll leave, Skipper,

18:11.914 --> 18:14.370
when we're done. Not before.

18:21.049 --> 18:23.919
You were right, Abby.
He's quite the handsome fellow.

18:24.010 --> 18:25.041
Yeah.

18:25.344 --> 18:29.294
Unfortunately, he doesn't look like
any of the guys that Gibbs suspects.

18:29.390 --> 18:32.344
Could our leader's golden gut
be wrong this time?

18:33.311 --> 18:34.831
I'm going to e-mail this dude to Tony,

18:34.896 --> 18:37.434
and see if anyone at Norfolk
recognizes him.

18:42.195 --> 18:44.864
- Do you see it yet?
- Yeah, it's coming through.

18:45.114 --> 18:47.901
So you getting lonely
down there by yourself, hon?

18:47.992 --> 18:51.990
I'm not alone. I'm with
Special Agent McGee. Say hello.

18:52.205 --> 18:54.909
Hey, McGee. How's your SIG hanging?

18:56.959 --> 18:58.335
Got to go, Abs.

19:02.673 --> 19:04.832
- What's she look like?
- Who?

19:04.926 --> 19:06.918
Abby. Sounds cute.

19:07.595 --> 19:09.089
Not your type.

19:09.680 --> 19:11.507
Well, how do you know that?

19:13.017 --> 19:16.718
Have you ever had the slightest urge
to tattoo your buttocks, McGee?

19:17.063 --> 19:18.771
I don't think so.

19:18.856 --> 19:20.648
Then we need never speak of her again.

19:20.733 --> 19:22.419
Make copies.
Circulate them around the base.

19:22.443 --> 19:24.519
See if anyone recognizes the guy.

19:31.702 --> 19:34.158
- I've acquired a target, sir.
- Distance?

19:34.247 --> 19:36.453
- 6,100 yards.
- Bearing?

19:37.583 --> 19:40.703
- 035 relative.
- Depth?

19:40.878 --> 19:42.337
450 feet.

19:42.713 --> 19:45.880
Helm, steer 095.
15 degrees down bubble.

19:45.967 --> 19:49.715
Aye, sir. Helm 095.
15 degrees down bubble.

19:54.976 --> 19:57.680
The fingerprints we took
match those in the service records.

19:57.770 --> 20:00.806
If there's an impostor, it's not
one of the five that we interviewed.

20:00.898 --> 20:02.143
It has to be.

20:03.234 --> 20:06.769
- What if he's on another boat?
- This is the one that makes sense.

20:06.946 --> 20:08.423
The killer didn't just dump the body,

20:08.447 --> 20:11.117
he removed identifying features
in case it was found.

20:11.200 --> 20:14.534
If it were found, he knew
it'd take between 24 and 48 hours

20:14.620 --> 20:16.245
for AFDIL to make a DNA match.

20:16.330 --> 20:20.079
Whatever he was planning to do,
it was going to be in that timeframe.

20:20.251 --> 20:23.834
In that time frame, the Philadelphia
was the only boat going out.

20:28.176 --> 20:31.758
- Where'd you get the records?
- Personnel office, Norfolk.

20:34.348 --> 20:37.682
What if someone altered
the service record

20:37.852 --> 20:40.853
before we or Commander Peters got it?

20:41.689 --> 20:44.856
Meaning that the impostor worked
in the personnel office.

20:44.942 --> 20:46.769
Or has an accomplice.

20:55.093 --> 20:59.043
Sonar signature looks like the Augusta.
6,100 yards.

20:59.139 --> 21:00.384
Target bearing?

21:00.474 --> 21:04.388
Still 035 relative.
We're in his baffle, Skipper.

21:04.478 --> 21:07.432
- Range?
- 6,000 yards and closing, Skipper.

21:07.523 --> 21:09.147
I got you, Jimmy.

21:11.527 --> 21:13.899
I need to contact NCIS
headquarters now.

21:13.987 --> 21:16.775
Range to target: 5,800 and closing.

21:16.865 --> 21:20.448
No can do, Agent Gibbs.
I'm about to win a bottle of Stoli.

21:20.536 --> 21:22.742
Weps, get me a firing solution.

21:22.913 --> 21:25.016
Your bottle of vodka's going to
have to wait, Skipper.

21:25.040 --> 21:26.700
I need to talk to headquarters now.

21:26.792 --> 21:29.995
We'd have to break contact
and go to periscope depth.

21:30.087 --> 21:31.249
Whatever it takes.

21:31.338 --> 21:33.461
I'm not terminating this exercise

21:33.549 --> 21:36.004
so you can have a chat
with the folks back home.

21:36.093 --> 21:40.137
Let me give this to you straight, Skipper.
There's a threat on this boat.

21:40.222 --> 21:43.176
It's a real threat. It's not a game.

21:45.811 --> 21:47.602
- XO.
- Sir?

21:47.729 --> 21:51.063
Make your depth 150 feet.

21:51.400 --> 21:55.528
Sonar, see if you can hang on to it.
Take us up to periscope depth.

21:56.989 --> 22:00.192
Aye, aye, sir. Make our depth 150 feet.

22:00.617 --> 22:04.033
Slow to all ahead two-thirds.
Stand by to go to periscope depth.

22:04.121 --> 22:07.739
I'll give you two minutes,
Special Agent Gibbs.

22:17.134 --> 22:20.503
They're patching through
to your man. Two minutes.

22:25.183 --> 22:28.019
COB, why'd we stop
the attack on the Augusta?

22:28.103 --> 22:29.597
Cops had to make a phone call.

22:29.688 --> 22:32.166
It's got something to do
with them interrogating us, doesn't it?

22:32.190 --> 22:34.681
No. Why would you think that,
Petty Officer?

22:40.824 --> 22:42.532
- DiNozzo.
- Tony.

22:43.368 --> 22:45.694
Hi, Boss. Did you find the guy?

22:45.829 --> 22:48.035
Nope. Could be any one of our five.

22:48.123 --> 22:50.199
What's your famous gut say?

22:50.292 --> 22:53.661
For you to find out who had access
to the Philadelphia's service records.

22:53.754 --> 22:55.960
- Think they were altered?
- Good guess.

22:56.048 --> 22:58.373
- It wasn't a guess.
- Then why'd you ask?

22:58.467 --> 23:00.210
I didn't ask. It was a

23:01.219 --> 23:02.927
definitive statement.

23:05.891 --> 23:09.224
I have good news and bad news, Abby.

23:10.437 --> 23:12.643
- I hate payback.
- Which first?

23:14.024 --> 23:15.055
Bad.

23:15.317 --> 23:19.730
No DNA matches on our victim.
The AFDIL computers are still down.

23:20.238 --> 23:21.898
Okay. Good.

23:22.282 --> 23:25.782
I know why Hugh Grant
didn't match any of the photos.

23:28.121 --> 23:30.244
Okay, you got your payback.
Tell me why.

23:30.332 --> 23:33.582
Gibbs thinks
one of the service records was altered.

23:33.669 --> 23:37.002
- So all of this was a waste of time?
- Au contraire.

23:37.089 --> 23:41.003
All we have to do is get photos
of those five crew members

23:41.093 --> 23:43.085
from an independent source.

23:43.178 --> 23:45.171
That'll take longer than a DNA match.

23:45.263 --> 23:48.549
I have photographs
of every cricket team I ever played on

23:48.642 --> 23:51.892
from second form all the way
through up to the upper sixth.

23:51.979 --> 23:55.727
You see, in our last year,
we made the division finals.

23:56.066 --> 23:58.937
Grant you, I was only on the reserve.

23:59.027 --> 24:02.112
I just know
that there's a point here somewhere.

24:02.739 --> 24:05.064
All ships have a crew photograph.

24:05.575 --> 24:06.607
Yes.

24:07.119 --> 24:09.740
Yes! Yes!

24:10.288 --> 24:13.455
I'll download crew photos from websites

24:13.542 --> 24:16.033
of the five suspects'
previous deployments.

24:16.169 --> 24:19.870
You should have seen me in my whites.
I was rather handsome,

24:20.507 --> 24:22.630
even if I do say so myself.

24:23.635 --> 24:26.636
When a sailor reports to Norfolk,
we download their service file,

24:26.722 --> 24:29.972
update it if necessary, and make
a hard copy for the sailor's command.

24:30.058 --> 24:31.434
You update their photos?

24:31.518 --> 24:34.353
Only on re-enlistments
and significant promotions.

24:34.438 --> 24:38.815
Most updates are performance
evaluations, awards, marital status.

24:39.109 --> 24:41.379
So your department can change
anything in the service record?

24:41.403 --> 24:42.945
- Yes.
- Fingerprints?

24:43.030 --> 24:44.939
We could, but why would we?

24:45.032 --> 24:46.574
Who handles submarine command?

24:46.658 --> 24:49.114
Everyone. We don't assign work
based on specific commands.

24:49.202 --> 24:50.862
And how many people
work here, Lieutenant?

24:50.954 --> 24:53.706
Four officers, 12 enlisted
and 47 civilians.

24:53.790 --> 24:55.284
That's a lot of people.

24:55.375 --> 24:57.582
They don't think so.
We've been swamped since Iraq

24:57.669 --> 25:00.160
with all the transfers in and out of here.

25:00.255 --> 25:03.256
So you wouldn't know who handled
crew replacement for a specific ship?

25:03.341 --> 25:05.417
No, but I could ask.
They might remember.

25:05.510 --> 25:08.511
They might remember,
but I don't think they'd tell us.

25:09.056 --> 25:10.170
Why not?

25:11.516 --> 25:13.473
I promise to tell you someday.

25:15.187 --> 25:17.678
Can I have a copy
of your personnel roster?

25:18.398 --> 25:20.806
As long as you keep your promise.

25:20.984 --> 25:23.226
Jonesy, I need a copy
of our personnel roster.

25:23.320 --> 25:24.482
Right away, Lieutenant.

25:24.571 --> 25:25.602
- Sir?
- Yeah?

25:25.697 --> 25:28.069
May I ask the Lieutenant a question?

25:28.408 --> 25:30.733
McGee, you don't need my permission
to ask a question,

25:30.827 --> 25:32.867
as long as you're not
asking her on a date.

25:32.954 --> 25:34.698
No, sir. Not my type.

25:37.542 --> 25:40.828
Lieutenant, Special Agent McGee
has a question. McGee?

25:42.089 --> 25:45.872
I was just wondering
if anyone had quit in the last few days.

25:45.967 --> 25:48.968
As matter of fact,
Joshua Fox quit two days ago.

25:49.054 --> 25:52.138
- How long did he work here?
- A little over a year.

25:52.224 --> 25:54.263
He transferred into personnel
a month ago.

25:54.351 --> 25:56.260
Could you get us his address?

25:57.145 --> 25:59.268
Thanks. It's on the roster.

25:59.898 --> 26:01.273
Thank you.

26:03.026 --> 26:05.778
- You're learning, McGee.
- Thank you, sir.

26:07.823 --> 26:09.981
- Anything?
- No, sir.

26:11.451 --> 26:12.993
I can't find him.

26:14.121 --> 26:15.780
Damn NCIS.

26:21.002 --> 26:23.493
- Drink.
- What's with all the water?

26:23.588 --> 26:27.633
- You got to hydrate on a submarine.
- All you've had me doing is hydrating.

26:27.717 --> 26:28.962
Drink it.

26:36.309 --> 26:37.887
So how's your bladder?

26:39.437 --> 26:40.517
What?

26:41.106 --> 26:42.683
The COB's
at the end of the passageway,

26:42.774 --> 26:44.731
trying to keep an eye on us.

26:44.818 --> 26:46.775
You got to distract him.

26:47.362 --> 26:49.402
You're going to need help
working the toilet.

26:49.489 --> 26:51.031
- Gibbs...
- Trust me, Kate.

26:51.116 --> 26:53.737
On a submarine,
it's a very complicated mechanism.

26:53.827 --> 26:56.744
Is that why you've been shoving water
down my throat for the past hour?

26:56.830 --> 26:58.869
I want to check out
Petty Officer Thompson.

26:58.957 --> 27:00.893
Well, you don't have to drown me.
You could just ask.

27:00.917 --> 27:02.115
Come on.

27:02.961 --> 27:05.748
Hydrating's good for you.
Go on, un-hydrate.

27:07.382 --> 27:09.838
- Never heard it called that before.
- Go on.

27:14.723 --> 27:18.672
Commander Peters said I could use
the facilities in his quarters, COB.

27:19.269 --> 27:21.143
Yes, ma'am. This way.

28:08.526 --> 28:12.061
Well, either no one's home
or not answering.

28:12.155 --> 28:13.530
What should we do?

28:13.615 --> 28:15.607
Get inside, look around.

28:16.284 --> 28:18.989
Then we'll need
a command search authorization.

28:22.582 --> 28:25.038
You know, this is civilian property, sir.

28:25.126 --> 28:28.330
We'll have to go to a local judge
to get a search warrant.

28:29.756 --> 28:31.250
Or play football.

28:33.843 --> 28:35.088
Go deep.

28:36.471 --> 28:37.882
Go deep.

28:38.265 --> 28:41.468
Oh, look at him! He breaks free!
Go, man, go!

28:41.601 --> 28:42.632
He's looking for McGee.

28:42.727 --> 28:44.720
It's a play-action pass.
He's deep in the pocket.

28:44.813 --> 28:47.386
He can't find McGee.
He's covered! He's in the open!

28:47.482 --> 28:49.142
He's broken clear.

28:51.653 --> 28:53.112
He's still got it.

28:55.198 --> 28:59.243
- This is breaking and entering!
- No. That was breaking.

28:59.786 --> 29:01.114
This is entering.

29:08.169 --> 29:11.170
- We going to need a torque wrench.
- I'll get it.

29:17.262 --> 29:20.547
- You trouble me, Thompson.
- How's that, sir?

29:20.849 --> 29:23.636
I don't think you were
completely honest with us.

29:24.019 --> 29:25.394
Yes, I was.

29:30.233 --> 29:32.391
I think you lied about high school.

29:32.610 --> 29:34.188
Why would you do that?

29:35.488 --> 29:38.655
- The truth, sir?
- Oh, yeah. That's always the best.

29:41.077 --> 29:43.829
I missed a year of high school
'cause I was in juvenile detention.

29:43.913 --> 29:46.665
My record was expunged,
but I was afraid if the navy found out,

29:46.750 --> 29:48.493
I'd never see the inside of a sub.

29:48.585 --> 29:50.127
Agent Gibbs.

29:50.211 --> 29:52.500
You were asked
to stay in the wardroom.

29:55.050 --> 29:58.253
- You can go back to work, Petty Officer.
- Aye, aye, COB.

30:14.486 --> 30:15.684
Busted.

30:20.241 --> 30:24.571
- I didn't appreciate that little stunt.
- Cut us a little slack. No harm, no foul.

30:24.662 --> 30:28.281
No, sir. The skipper's cooperated
with you every step of the way.

30:28.375 --> 30:31.375
Chief of the boat
knows the crew better than the skipper.

30:31.461 --> 30:33.869
You bothered
by any of the men we questioned?

30:33.963 --> 30:36.336
We've only been out one day,
Agent Gibbs.

30:36.466 --> 30:39.467
I make it a practice
not making snap judgments.

30:39.928 --> 30:43.047
It could be something little,
seemingly inconsequential.

30:43.139 --> 30:45.262
Did you get a strange vibration
about any of them?

30:45.350 --> 30:48.267
No. But if I do get any vibrations,

30:48.895 --> 30:51.267
they'll come to you through the skipper.

30:55.527 --> 30:58.065
Do people react that way
because we're NCIS,

30:58.154 --> 31:00.906
or do you just have that effect on them?

31:01.324 --> 31:02.783
I like to think it's me.

31:03.159 --> 31:05.946
I downloaded crew photos
from the ships our suspects served on,

31:06.037 --> 31:07.412
and I got nada.

31:07.497 --> 31:09.573
No one looks like him in any of them.

31:09.666 --> 31:12.667
- I don't know what to do now.
- Absent a miracle,

31:13.169 --> 31:16.004
we'll just have to wait
for the DNA report.

31:30.103 --> 31:32.345
I don't think this guy's
ever cooked in his kitchen.

31:32.439 --> 31:34.930
No plates, no utensils, nothing.

31:35.024 --> 31:36.898
It's all store-bought junk.

31:36.985 --> 31:39.939
There's not one personal item here,
not even a phone.

31:40.655 --> 31:42.813
Well, maybe he used his cell phone.

31:44.284 --> 31:45.659
What's that?

31:46.619 --> 31:49.988
It's a DSL line.
It's running from this jack to

31:51.916 --> 31:53.458
under the bookcase.

31:53.543 --> 31:54.823
All right.

31:54.961 --> 31:57.748
Slide this towards you on three.
One, two, three.

32:37.612 --> 32:40.566
Guess flying toasters
would have been too much to ask for.

32:40.656 --> 32:42.483
Let's see what we have here.

32:44.410 --> 32:46.616
You've taken computer classes.

32:46.787 --> 32:49.325
Master's in computer forensics, MIT.

32:50.541 --> 32:51.704
I see.

32:52.251 --> 32:54.125
Well, he's definitely an eco-terrorist.

32:54.211 --> 32:56.833
He's looking for retribution
for the whales.

32:58.049 --> 33:00.006
- Oh, this isn't good.
- Why?

33:00.801 --> 33:03.423
Isopropene methylphosphonofluoridate.

33:05.890 --> 33:08.297
B.S. In biomedical engineering,
Johns Hopkins.

33:08.392 --> 33:09.424
You?

33:10.478 --> 33:12.517
Ohio State, phys-ed.

33:13.147 --> 33:14.606
I was a jock.

33:15.608 --> 33:18.692
- What is that in my language?
- Sarin gas.

33:19.695 --> 33:21.439
Well, he's planning on introducing it

33:21.530 --> 33:23.986
into a submarine's
air conditioning system.

33:24.075 --> 33:25.699
Doesn't say how.

33:32.458 --> 33:35.909
- It wouldn't take a lot, would it?
- Must have been a prototype.

33:37.546 --> 33:41.165
If it was filled with sarin gas,
and distributed through the air system?

33:41.258 --> 33:43.168
It could kill the entire crew.

33:53.729 --> 33:57.063
Skipper, we have an incoming
emergency action message

33:57.149 --> 33:59.640
on the low-frequency receiver, sir.

34:01.737 --> 34:03.730
"Impostor on board. No I.D.

34:03.823 --> 34:05.981
"Threat of sarin gas
to air conditioning system.

34:06.075 --> 34:07.450
"Take immediate action."

34:07.535 --> 34:10.737
Have Engineering shut down the
air conditioning system and tear it apart.

34:10.830 --> 34:12.407
And get those agents up here now.

34:12.498 --> 34:13.577
Aye, aye, sir.

34:13.666 --> 34:16.204
Surface! Surface! Surface!
Emergency blow!

34:16.293 --> 34:19.293
Surface! Surface! Surface!
Emergency blow!

34:19.630 --> 34:21.422
Emergency blow! Surface, aye!

34:25.094 --> 34:26.967
What's happening?

34:27.513 --> 34:29.221
Emergency blow.

34:31.516 --> 34:34.967
Skipper wants you.
But hang on a moment.

34:43.279 --> 34:46.563
- Wow!
- Yeah, that's what they all tell me.

35:01.047 --> 35:03.288
I remembered that I was absent

35:03.382 --> 35:05.790
the day the science club
took our picture.

35:06.010 --> 35:07.208
And that made me think,

35:07.303 --> 35:10.754
"What if one of the five missed
his crew picture?"

35:12.016 --> 35:14.008
Petty Officer Drew.

35:15.978 --> 35:19.181
He was absent the day
the Topeka took their photo.

35:19.398 --> 35:21.142
Where'd you get this picture?

35:21.233 --> 35:23.985
I downloaded it
off the sub's online newsletter.

35:24.445 --> 35:27.896
Drew is a sonar operator
on the Philadelphia.

35:29.492 --> 35:31.780
No, he's not. He's in my cold storage.

35:33.162 --> 35:36.329
Someone else
is sitting at his sonar station.

35:37.500 --> 35:40.785
Sir, request permission
to make a head call.

35:41.545 --> 35:44.665
Emergency blow loosen you up,
Petty Officer Drew?

35:45.132 --> 35:48.335
All right, Martin, relieve Drew.

35:48.427 --> 35:49.625
Open all hatches.

35:49.720 --> 35:51.512
Break out emergency breathing gear.

35:51.597 --> 35:54.432
Aye, aye, sir. Open all hatches.
Break out emergency breathing gear.

35:54.517 --> 35:57.304
Aye, sir. Ensign, 1-MC, all emergency...

35:57.394 --> 36:00.645
- Any idea who the hell he is?
- We're working on it.

36:01.524 --> 36:04.193
Skipper, we've got another EAM
coming in, sir.

36:10.282 --> 36:12.322
Where is Petty Officer Drew?

36:13.119 --> 36:15.076
He had to visit the head, sir.

36:46.944 --> 36:48.937
Hey, we matched the prints you faxed.

36:49.029 --> 36:51.437
Former Petty Officer
Second Sean Travis.

36:53.117 --> 36:55.608
- Sonar operator?
- That's right.

36:55.911 --> 36:57.868
Spent a couple of tours on attack subs

36:57.955 --> 36:59.475
before he was
dishonourably discharged.

36:59.540 --> 37:02.576
Was he hooked up with the
protesters outside the gates?

37:02.668 --> 37:05.373
The FBI's checking that,
but they think he and Joshua Fox

37:05.504 --> 37:08.339
were part of some small
three- or four-man cell

37:08.424 --> 37:10.048
of radical eco whale freaks.

37:10.426 --> 37:13.510
- Did you get Fox and the rest of them?
- Not yet.

37:14.180 --> 37:15.460
What's going on down there?

37:16.807 --> 37:18.349
We're on the surface.

37:18.809 --> 37:21.383
- I guess Gibbs hung up.
- Good guess.

37:23.272 --> 37:25.265
Secure from emergency breathing.

37:25.399 --> 37:27.605
Engineer's gone through
the air conditioning system.

37:27.693 --> 37:29.816
Looks like he never got
his canister into it.

37:29.904 --> 37:31.861
It's somewhere on this boat.

37:31.947 --> 37:35.197
We'll search,
but if it's as small as you say it is,

37:35.326 --> 37:36.950
it could be hidden just about anywhere.

37:37.036 --> 37:39.514
Well, if the canister remains sealed,
it shouldn't be a problem.

37:39.538 --> 37:41.016
Oh, we'll tear the boat apart
if we have to,

37:41.040 --> 37:43.281
when we get to Norfolk.
XO, prepare to dive.

37:43.375 --> 37:44.407
Aye, aye, sir.

37:44.501 --> 37:45.533
We're going back down?

37:45.628 --> 37:48.545
We're 15 knots faster
submerged than on the surface.

37:48.631 --> 37:51.382
I'd leave the air conditioning system
offline as a precaution.

37:51.467 --> 37:54.633
I fully intend to.
It's going to get hot in here.

37:55.221 --> 37:57.213
We're used to taking heat.

38:06.982 --> 38:08.311
Hiya, Abby.

38:08.984 --> 38:12.982
- While the boss is away, huh?
- I earned my paycheck today.

38:14.073 --> 38:15.567
That's what I heard.

38:15.908 --> 38:17.188
Exhibit "A."

38:17.576 --> 38:19.154
Any idea how it works?

38:22.748 --> 38:24.824
So what's agent McGee like?

38:25.501 --> 38:26.829
Like most newbies.

38:26.919 --> 38:29.671
Quiet, green, gullible.

38:30.005 --> 38:31.036
Bi.

38:31.590 --> 38:32.669
I don't think so.

38:32.758 --> 38:34.834
No, Tony, the canister.

38:34.969 --> 38:36.677
It has a bi-metal trigger.

38:38.222 --> 38:41.638
Yeah, so it's turned on by either...
Either what?

38:41.809 --> 38:43.089
Hot or cold.

38:49.191 --> 38:50.769
This one digs cold.

38:50.859 --> 38:53.979
When the temperature drops
below five degrees centigrade,

38:54.113 --> 38:56.651
the trigger releases
whatever's in the canister.

38:56.740 --> 38:59.148
- What is in the canister?
- Sarin gas.

38:59.243 --> 39:00.523
Nasty.

39:00.911 --> 39:03.449
So what's cold enough
to trigger it on a sub?

39:03.539 --> 39:06.824
Fridge, freezer, air-conditioner.

39:07.209 --> 39:09.000
Is agent McGee cute?

39:09.628 --> 39:12.166
Can a guy be cute to you
without body art?

39:12.673 --> 39:13.788
Sure.

39:14.550 --> 39:16.127
I'm not a snob.

39:17.761 --> 39:20.632
How can you drink coffee
when it's 100 degrees?

39:21.181 --> 39:22.676
It helps me think.

39:23.851 --> 39:25.345
What's bugging you?

39:25.853 --> 39:29.352
- Travis not releasing the sarin.
- He never had a chance.

39:29.606 --> 39:31.646
And he was quarantined or on duty

39:31.734 --> 39:33.940
until the air conditioning system
was shut down.

39:34.028 --> 39:35.688
What was his backup plan?

39:37.239 --> 39:39.944
- He would have had one.
- What makes you so sure?

39:40.034 --> 39:41.658
This whack-job
knew he was going to die

39:41.744 --> 39:43.238
as soon as he released the gas.

39:43.329 --> 39:45.487
Why commit suicide
before he could do it?

39:45.581 --> 39:49.116
He knew we were onto him.
I mean, like you said, he was a whacko.

39:51.211 --> 39:52.456
Yeah. Enter.

39:54.381 --> 39:56.872
Courtesy of the skipper, sir, ma'am.

39:56.967 --> 40:01.179
There's Rocky Road, cookies
and cream, chocolate, butter pecan,

40:01.263 --> 40:04.264
and the captain's
personal favourite, pumpkin.

40:05.476 --> 40:06.555
Pumpkin?

40:08.479 --> 40:10.187
Do you think we have enough, Steward?

40:10.272 --> 40:12.561
Well, there's about 40 gallons more
in the galley, ma'am.

40:12.649 --> 40:14.891
Might as well eat it before it melts.

40:15.361 --> 40:16.641
I don't get it.

40:16.737 --> 40:19.572
They had to make room
in the freezer for the body.

40:20.240 --> 40:21.320
Nice.

40:21.408 --> 40:24.658
It's the only place to preserve it, ma'am.
SOP on a sub.

40:33.837 --> 40:34.917
What?

40:39.259 --> 40:41.585
Anyone who's served on a sub
knows that.

40:42.429 --> 40:44.221
Travis didn't commit suicide to give up.

40:44.306 --> 40:46.429
Suicide was his backup plan.
Where's the freezer, COB?

40:46.517 --> 40:49.683
Loading door right here, sir. Right there.

40:53.440 --> 40:55.812
The bastard booby-trapped himself.

40:56.610 --> 40:58.816
Once he knew that he couldn't get
in the cooling system,

40:58.904 --> 41:01.062
he went to his backup plan
before we could arrest him.

41:01.156 --> 41:03.564
The sarin gas canister
was designed to be triggered by cold.

41:03.659 --> 41:05.940
Travis knew that if he died,
you'd put him in the freezer.

41:05.994 --> 41:07.786
- You mean he swallowed the canister?
- Yeah.

41:07.871 --> 41:10.623
If his core temperature gets
to the trigger temperature,

41:10.707 --> 41:12.118
the gas will be released.

41:12.209 --> 41:13.751
It already has.

41:14.378 --> 41:16.252
When it leaks out, we're gonna die.

41:16.338 --> 41:18.108
I'll get the skipper
to do another emergency...

41:18.132 --> 41:20.670
There's no time for that.
Kate, go fill in the skipper.

41:20.759 --> 41:22.918
Come on.
There's one way to get this guy

41:23.011 --> 41:26.131
off this boat in a hurry. Go! Move it!

41:26.223 --> 41:27.468
Gangway! Move!

41:27.558 --> 41:29.349
Make a hole! Make a hole!

41:30.227 --> 41:31.970
Move it! Move!

41:34.648 --> 41:36.226
- Help us.
- Thompson, we need a tube!

41:36.316 --> 41:38.475
We've got torpedoes
in two, three and four, sir.

41:38.569 --> 41:40.849
- Load this in one.
- Evans is in there doing maintenance!

41:40.904 --> 41:43.775
- Get him out of there.
- Get him out, guys. Come on.

41:43.991 --> 41:46.149
Torpedo room, con.

41:47.202 --> 41:48.862
Con, torpedo room, COB.

41:48.954 --> 41:50.496
You have permission to fire!

41:50.581 --> 41:51.826
Aye, aye, sir.

41:55.961 --> 41:58.333
- Secure the inner door!
- Aye, aye!

41:58.839 --> 41:59.918
Ready water shot!

42:00.007 --> 42:01.501
- Aye, aye!
- Open outer door!

42:01.592 --> 42:03.501
- Outer door open!
- Flood two!

42:03.594 --> 42:05.586
- Two flooding!
- Fire number one!

42:13.061 --> 42:16.347
COB, I don't have to tell you what
the most important thing is now, do I?

42:16.440 --> 42:18.314
Getting the ice cream
back in the freezer.

42:18.400 --> 42:19.598
Exactly.

42:24.156 --> 42:26.279
- Welcome back.
- Hey.

42:26.366 --> 42:28.692
Nice cap.
They make you the boat mascot?

42:29.369 --> 42:32.821
This is your way of telling me
how much you missed me, isn't it?

42:32.915 --> 42:33.946
No.

42:37.085 --> 42:39.374
What are you doing here,
Special Agent McGee?

42:39.463 --> 42:41.455
I brought my final report, sir.

42:41.548 --> 42:43.671
You do not have to "sir" me, McGee.

42:43.759 --> 42:45.882
Didn't they teach you
how to use e-mail at MIT?

42:45.969 --> 42:47.428
You graduated from MIT?

42:47.513 --> 42:49.137
And Johns Hopkins.

42:50.224 --> 42:51.599
I didn't tell him.

42:55.062 --> 42:58.561
- What are you doing here?
- I've got a lunch date with Abby.

43:02.319 --> 43:04.359
I got to see this. I'll take you to her!

43:04.446 --> 43:06.237
- Thanks.
- Thanks what?

43:06.907 --> 43:08.401
- Tony?
- Sir.

43:09.409 --> 43:12.245
I already warned you,
Abby's not your type.

43:12.496 --> 43:14.738
Well, I'd like to find out for myself.

43:14.831 --> 43:16.409
Yeah, listen, kid,

43:17.000 --> 43:21.045
I don't want to hurt your feelings,
but you're not exactly Abby's type.

43:21.547 --> 43:23.254
I've taken care of that.

43:23.757 --> 43:26.213
Remember that urge
you were talking about?

43:27.928 --> 43:29.303
I went with "Mom."

43:35.602 --> 43:38.224
I wonder what he said
to make Tony speechless.

43:39.898 --> 43:42.389
He told him he got a tat on his ass.
