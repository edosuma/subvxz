00:01.134 --> 00:02.863
Previously on Eli Stone:

00:02.936 --> 00:04.301
Things are different, Eli.

00:04.404 --> 00:06.564
Because you kissed me
then I kissed you,

00:06.673 --> 00:09.972
then you responded by disappearing
across the country for a week.

00:10.043 --> 00:11.533
It was just sex.

00:11.611 --> 00:14.774
I've had "just sex. "
What we had was something else.

00:14.848 --> 00:18.807
Are you about to tell me that nothing
is going on between you and Maggie?

00:18.918 --> 00:23.218
Nothing is going on between me and...
Is that an engagement ring?

00:23.289 --> 00:26.383
I'm gonna find a surgeon
and get this thing out of my head.

00:26.459 --> 00:28.324
I'm not sure you should
have the operation.

00:28.395 --> 00:30.556
Something's happening, beyond science.

00:46.746 --> 00:47.974
Morning, Bill.

00:48.048 --> 00:51.279
How long you been buying your paper
at this stand, Mr. Stone?

00:51.351 --> 00:55.185
Oh, I don't know. Since I moved
into my apartment. About five years?

00:55.255 --> 00:56.745
- That sounds right.
- Yeah.

00:56.823 --> 01:00.782
I know about your breakup with Taylor,
about how she came to work with you.

01:00.894 --> 01:04.057
- About the other girl you work with.
- Yeah, I'm a sharer, Bill.

01:04.164 --> 01:06.325
- The name's Hank.
- Oh.

01:06.399 --> 01:09.698
Yeah, I'm just saying.
Actually, she's my ex-sister-in-law.

01:09.769 --> 01:13.535
She wrote a paper about acquaintances.

01:36.262 --> 01:39.698
Live brave! Live brave!

01:52.479 --> 01:54.310
Who is that?

01:54.380 --> 01:56.541
That's David Mosely!

01:57.417 --> 01:59.248
David Mosely?

02:01.588 --> 02:03.146
David who?

02:03.223 --> 02:04.315
David Mosely.

02:04.390 --> 02:07.484
Everyone was acting like
he was a rock star or something.

02:07.560 --> 02:11.394
Usually the rock stars in your visions
are older, whiter and more British.

02:11.464 --> 02:13.091
That's very helpful.

02:13.166 --> 02:15.464
Eli, I'm happy
to help interpret your visions.

02:15.535 --> 02:18.026
Since you're convinced
they're hallucinations,

02:18.104 --> 02:19.731
I'm not sure what I can do for you.

02:19.806 --> 02:23.173
- Well, I had to tell someone.
- What about your brother, the doctor?

02:23.276 --> 02:26.973
- Or the neurosurgeon he found for you?
- Sounds like somebody's jealous.

02:27.046 --> 02:28.604
You can't have it both ways, Eli.

02:28.715 --> 02:32.242
Are you having hallucinations
or divinely inspired visions?

02:32.318 --> 02:35.879
Why does the man upstairs have to be
involved for me to get interpretation?

02:35.955 --> 02:39.516
You want to find out Mosely's
significance, find out if he's real,

02:39.592 --> 02:42.152
if he exists in the present.

02:42.262 --> 02:44.822
He'd be in his mid to late 20's,
African-American.

02:44.898 --> 02:48.334
I need you to get me a list
of all the David Moselys you can find.

02:48.401 --> 02:49.834
Uh-huh.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.632
Look at that.

02:53.373 --> 02:56.638
I'm sorry to interrupt
your Web-surfing with actual work.

02:56.709 --> 02:59.337
You scratch my back, I scratch yours.
Just look at him.

02:59.412 --> 03:01.505
It's the saddest thing I've ever seen.

03:01.581 --> 03:05.745
He just sits there, heartbroken,
because the zoo took away his mate.

03:05.852 --> 03:08.514
Isn't it a violation
of equal protection?

03:08.588 --> 03:11.079
I mean, the state
can't separate me from my fiancé.

03:11.157 --> 03:14.126
Your fiancé? You didn't tell me
you were engaged to a monkey.

03:14.227 --> 03:17.321
He's not a monkey, he's a chimp, Steve.
His mate, Pete.

03:17.397 --> 03:21.493
But some right-wing, close-minded
crazies are trying to keep them apart.

03:21.568 --> 03:24.401
You're saying that they're gay?
They're gay chimps?

03:24.470 --> 03:27.303
Just look at his little face.
See how happy they were?

03:27.373 --> 03:29.034
Sorry. I don't practice chimp law.

03:29.108 --> 03:31.872
You will if you want me
to find this Mosely guy.

03:31.978 --> 03:34.708
Quid pro quo, Eli. Aw.

03:34.781 --> 03:37.147
- He's the cutest.
- I know.

03:37.217 --> 03:41.551
Next item, our summer associate
recruiting program...

03:41.621 --> 03:42.918
Marci.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.324
Don't let me interrupt.

03:46.392 --> 03:51.056
Too late. You all know Marci Klein,
as in Wethersby, Posner and...

03:51.130 --> 03:53.894
Not to mention the colonizer
of our London office.

03:53.967 --> 03:56.435
Make some room at the table
for Ms. Klein.

03:56.502 --> 03:58.265
After all, she picked it out.

03:59.105 --> 04:02.131
Eli. I've heard about the, um...

04:05.411 --> 04:07.038
Should you be sitting?

04:07.113 --> 04:09.877
I'm fine, Ms. Klein. Thank you.

04:12.485 --> 04:15.613
I believe we were discussing
summer associate recruitment.

04:15.688 --> 04:17.451
- With everyone?
- Excuse me?

04:17.557 --> 04:22.119
I'm sorry. I was just admiring
how egalitarian we've become.

04:23.429 --> 04:26.694
Moving on. The Lipton SEC filing.

04:26.766 --> 04:28.529
Stone? You got a minute?

04:28.601 --> 04:31.695
Shouldn't you be busy trying
to hit on someone's fiancée?

04:31.771 --> 04:33.033
Oh, I'm busy with yours.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.631
In fact, that is what
I wanted to talk to you about.

04:35.708 --> 04:37.073
I could use some insight.

04:37.176 --> 04:40.043
Ever since the night
we did anything but sleep together,

04:40.113 --> 04:42.274
- she's been shutting me down.
- You kidding?

04:42.348 --> 04:44.908
You actually want me
to help you to pursue my ex?

04:44.984 --> 04:47.680
What? It's not like
you guys are together anymore.

04:47.754 --> 04:50.723
I would think, of all people,
you'd want her to be happy.

04:50.823 --> 04:53.792
And going out with you
achieves that how?

04:53.893 --> 04:57.056
That's funny.
Any inside information you can give me,

04:57.163 --> 04:59.188
you know, help grease the wheels?

05:02.935 --> 05:05.597
OK, OK, but you mustn't tell her
I said anything.

05:05.672 --> 05:06.832
No.

05:06.906 --> 05:09.272
You know how Taylor
loves animals, right?

05:09.342 --> 05:12.675
Anyone who knows her
knows that's her passion, animal rights.

05:12.745 --> 05:15.111
Oh, right. Yeah.
I love animals. Ask my cat.

05:15.181 --> 05:16.842
OK, well... Excuse me.

05:18.051 --> 05:21.020
Pete and Steve v. Parcland Zoo.

05:21.087 --> 05:23.146
Two chimpanzees who belong together.

05:23.222 --> 05:26.248
They've been ripped apart
by the forces of intolerance.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.557
I was gonna take it myself,
but if you want it to,

05:29.629 --> 05:32.325
say, co-counsel with Taylor...

05:33.933 --> 05:36.163
You're an extraordinary human being.

05:36.235 --> 05:37.793
So are you.

05:40.073 --> 05:43.509
- I solved your problem.
- You reunited Steve and Pete?

05:43.576 --> 05:46.272
No, the next best thing.
Matt Dowd's taking the case.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.405
What'd you find for me?

05:48.481 --> 05:51.541
Fifty-three Moselys.
All African-American,

05:51.617 --> 05:53.380
all between the ages of 20 and 40.

05:53.486 --> 05:56.046
Man, narrowing these down
is gonna take...

05:56.122 --> 05:58.352
Forever, I know.
Consider it a karma-gram

05:58.424 --> 06:01.689
for throwing Pete and Steve
to the tender mercies of Matt Dowd.

06:02.462 --> 06:05.829
Actually, I think I know which
of these Moselys I'm looking for.

06:09.802 --> 06:11.633
David Mosely?

06:11.704 --> 06:15.470
It says here you were
David Mosely's attorney way back when.

06:15.541 --> 06:17.236
Yeah, felony murder case.

06:17.310 --> 06:20.040
He's serving, 25 to life at Tipton Bay.

06:20.113 --> 06:22.411
Thanks, I really didn't know that.

06:22.982 --> 06:25.143
Well, I'm about to go visit him.

06:25.251 --> 06:29.017
As you're his last attorney of record,
you might want to come along.

06:29.088 --> 06:31.181
No, thank you.

06:31.257 --> 06:33.748
Keith, you're not even gonna ask
why I'm going?

06:33.826 --> 06:36.852
Too busy. Give him my regards.

07:01.587 --> 07:05.148
Mr. Mosely? My name is Eli Stone.

07:06.993 --> 07:09.257
This may sound a little strange,

07:10.530 --> 07:14.227
but you don't need a lawyer
by any chance, do you?

07:14.300 --> 07:16.268
Now, what was your first clue?

07:16.803 --> 07:19.738
Don't tell me.
It's the prison uniform, right?

07:20.540 --> 07:22.303
I'm sorry. I just...

07:22.375 --> 07:24.843
Criminal law isn't exactly
in my wheelhouse.

07:24.911 --> 07:28.642
Doesn't matter, anyway. Lawyers say
there's nothing to appeal in my case.

07:28.714 --> 07:30.477
Lju...

07:32.018 --> 07:34.680
If your accomplices
testified against you,

07:34.754 --> 07:36.779
I'd say it'd be pretty cut-and-dry.

07:36.856 --> 07:40.348
Except they're lying.
I never even went inside the store.

07:40.426 --> 07:42.792
I was in the car the whole time.

07:42.895 --> 07:44.954
So I damn sure didn't kill anybody.

07:49.202 --> 07:51.227
But that's ancient history, right?

07:51.304 --> 07:54.933
What's another 20 years
in prison, anyway?

07:55.007 --> 07:57.976
Twenty years?
When are you up for a parole?

08:00.379 --> 08:03.007
- I'm not.
- Well, I looked at your sentencing.

08:03.082 --> 08:05.710
You should be eligible right about now.

08:05.785 --> 08:09.551
Yeah, I have a right to parole.
But for that I need a parole hearing.

08:09.655 --> 08:12.021
And the warden
keeps turning down my request

08:12.124 --> 08:14.684
on account of disciplinary problems.

08:14.760 --> 08:17.092
There must be some reason.

08:19.565 --> 08:22.693
For a year now I've been sleeping
on the floor of my cell.

08:23.469 --> 08:27.428
The prison has three times
as many inmates as it was designed for.

08:27.507 --> 08:30.135
I led a hunger strike to change things.

08:30.209 --> 08:31.904
And he didn't appreciate that.

08:31.978 --> 08:34.037
Now it's costing me my parole hearing.

08:38.717 --> 08:40.845
But I don't care.

08:42.288 --> 08:46.019
People got to stand up
for what they believe in, Mr. Stone.

08:46.092 --> 08:48.390
- We've got to live...
- Live brave.

08:51.497 --> 08:52.862
Yeah.

09:08.814 --> 09:10.907
- How was prison?
- Not that nice.

09:11.284 --> 09:13.582
If you're in there serving,
say, 25 to life,

09:13.653 --> 09:15.883
you'd want to get out
as soon as possible.

09:15.955 --> 09:18.014
So I'm getting him a parole hearing.

09:18.090 --> 09:20.058
Why would he need your help?

09:20.126 --> 09:21.354
Vindictive warden.

09:21.427 --> 09:23.987
Well, it's not like
David isn't a troublemaker.

09:24.063 --> 09:27.032
- Says he's innocent.
- Everybody says they're innocent.

09:27.099 --> 09:29.124
You're lucky if you get an innocent one,

09:29.201 --> 09:31.635
a truly innocent one,
once every three years.

09:31.704 --> 09:34.070
- Those are the ones...
- That you fight for?

09:34.140 --> 09:37.439
- David wasn't one of them?
- So, look who's a criminal lawyer now.

09:37.510 --> 09:41.674
Guilty or not, he's been a model inmate.
He deserves a parole hearing.

09:41.747 --> 09:43.578
I know you don't know me that well...

09:43.649 --> 09:46.174
Didn't stop you accusing me
of failing my client.

09:46.252 --> 09:49.483
Those weren't my words.
Look, I got the warden to meet with me.

09:49.555 --> 09:53.582
But prisoners' rights,
I'm in unfamiliar territory here.

09:53.659 --> 09:55.889
I could use a guide.

09:59.532 --> 10:02.968
- You've got some new art.
- My not-so-secret vice.

10:03.035 --> 10:06.198
I remember your first original piece,
an Elmer Bischoff.

10:06.305 --> 10:08.068
No need to be diplomatic, Marci.

10:08.174 --> 10:10.904
Say what you took
a transcontinental flight to say.

10:12.578 --> 10:17.345
Midview Financial is the latest in a
string of Fortune-500 client defections.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.941
Beutel Pharmaceutical, Zyre Motors.

10:20.019 --> 10:22.954
And yet, billables
are up ten percent this quarter.

10:23.022 --> 10:24.956
After three in decline.

10:25.024 --> 10:27.390
- Talk to me about Eli Stone.
- Eli?

10:27.460 --> 10:29.621
- Well, you know about...
- Yes.

10:29.695 --> 10:33.426
He has an aneurysm and
a brand-new conscience to go with it.

10:33.499 --> 10:34.830
How wonderful for us.

10:34.900 --> 10:37.164
He's doing extraordinarily
well in court.

10:37.236 --> 10:38.203
That's not new.

10:38.304 --> 10:42.832
The problem comes when he uses
those talents to sue his own firm.

10:42.908 --> 10:46.969
Tell me, how is it that one associate
is worth the concern of a senior partner

10:47.046 --> 10:50.504
who hasn't even worked in this office
in three years?

10:50.583 --> 10:53.017
The fear is that
Mr. Stone is symptomatic

10:53.085 --> 10:55.610
of a larger problem here at WPK.

10:55.688 --> 10:58.748
No one's brought any such concerns
to my attention thus far.

10:58.824 --> 11:00.485
Consider it done.

11:02.061 --> 11:04.552
So help me, Matt,
this better be about actual work

11:04.630 --> 11:07.394
and not another attempt
to get into my pants.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.434
What the holy hell?

11:09.502 --> 11:11.026
This is Pete the chimp.

11:11.103 --> 11:15.130
Pete, shake hands
with Taylor Wethersby, your new lawyer.

11:17.109 --> 11:18.633
- His new what?
- Lawyer.

11:18.711 --> 11:20.736
Well, one of them.
We're his legal team.

11:20.813 --> 11:24.078
And this is Leila Maxford.
Leila's the vet at the Parcland Zoo.

11:24.150 --> 11:25.981
Uh, primatologist, actually.

11:26.052 --> 11:28.885
Mr. Dowd was telling me
your specialty is family law.

11:28.954 --> 11:33.050
Yes. Normally my cases are confined
to my own species, but...

11:33.125 --> 11:35.025
Uh, many zoologists would argue

11:35.094 --> 11:37.858
that the chimpanzee's already a member
of the homo genus.

11:37.963 --> 11:40.989
Oh, which would make Pete
a "homo" homo, right?

11:41.067 --> 11:43.797
So this is the gay chimpanzee case.

11:43.869 --> 11:45.632
I figured since you love animals,

11:45.738 --> 11:48.502
this would be the perfect case
for us to try together.

11:48.574 --> 11:51.737
Don't worry. You can thank me later,
with fewer clothes on.

11:51.811 --> 11:54.041
I'm sorry. Who told you I love animals?

11:54.113 --> 11:57.981
- Mr. Stone, get to your point.
- David Mosely has gotten his GED.,

11:58.050 --> 12:01.349
he's taken college courses,
he's shown exemplary behavior.

12:01.420 --> 12:03.115
Yes, here he is.

12:03.189 --> 12:06.716
Refused bathroom detail,
refused kitchen detail,

12:06.792 --> 12:09.693
encouraged others
to refuse their work detail,

12:09.762 --> 12:13.596
was found with prohibited
reading materials, refused to eat.

12:13.666 --> 12:16.157
I believe he was engaging
in civil disobedience,

12:16.235 --> 12:18.396
protesting the overcrowded conditions.

12:18.471 --> 12:22.032
This is not a college campus
where community activism is encouraged.

12:22.108 --> 12:24.668
- When can he expect to get a hearing?
- I don't know.

12:24.744 --> 12:28.271
Depends on that attitude of his.
Maybe another five years or so.

12:28.347 --> 12:31.714
- His learning curve's a bit steep.
- Five years? You got to be kidding!

12:31.817 --> 12:33.785
- If we're done...
- No, we're not done.

12:33.853 --> 12:35.753
We know you have a difficult job.

12:35.821 --> 12:38.688
Actually, it's pretty simple.
I feed them, I water them,

12:38.758 --> 12:41.522
I try to keep them from
killing each other. That's my job.

12:41.594 --> 12:45.360
- What about rehabilitation and reform?
- Not in my budget.

12:45.464 --> 12:48.558
OK, now we're done. We'll get David
a hearing before a judge.

12:48.634 --> 12:51.194
Well, if you think
that'll help, go ahead.

12:51.303 --> 12:55.433
I, for one, admire your optimism.
We don't see a lot of that around here.

12:58.611 --> 13:02.945
Eli! I hate animals.
Especially gorilla-type ones.

13:03.015 --> 13:06.314
Hate's a strong word.
Isn't it more of a fear thing with you?

13:06.385 --> 13:08.216
- What's she talking about?
- Apes.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.619
One's her client,
the other's her co-counsel.

13:10.689 --> 13:13.419
I can't believe
you're actually jealous of Matt Dowd.

13:13.492 --> 13:15.790
- I'm not jealous.
- Fine. We'll see if you are.

13:15.861 --> 13:19.422
I'll be in Matt's office
working shoulder to shoulder with him,

13:19.498 --> 13:21.398
late into the night.

13:23.569 --> 13:26.538
- You live a very interesting life.
- Don't I, though?

13:27.373 --> 13:29.000
Eli.

13:29.074 --> 13:31.099
David Mosely called.

13:31.177 --> 13:33.077
Something happened.

13:41.453 --> 13:43.978
- What's he doing here?
- I'm on your legal team.

13:44.824 --> 13:48.260
- Let's hope second time's the charm.
- I don't want his help.

13:48.327 --> 13:51.694
Well, you've been getting it already.

13:52.932 --> 13:55.264
- You all right?
- I'll survive.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.859
It's just a few broken ribs.

13:57.937 --> 13:59.495
How'd you get them?

13:59.605 --> 14:02.165
The warden knows how to make a point.

14:04.343 --> 14:07.176
We're going to make a point too.
You think habeas writ?

14:07.246 --> 14:11.182
That just helps David. I doubt he's
the only guy getting this treatment.

14:11.250 --> 14:15.550
All right, then we'll help everyone.
Class action on behalf

14:15.621 --> 14:19.455
of the entire prison population.
We'll sue for denial of parole hearings,

14:19.525 --> 14:23.962
violation of civil rights,
prisoner abuse. All of it.

14:24.029 --> 14:26.964
Something funny about that?

14:27.032 --> 14:29.057
I just like the way you boys roll.

14:36.508 --> 14:40.740
You've got 48 hours to go through
hundreds of boxes of DOC records.

14:40.813 --> 14:44.271
Within those pages we have to find
evidence of a pattern of abuse.

14:44.350 --> 14:48.013
- And link it to Tipton Bay's warden.
- What's going on here?

14:48.087 --> 14:51.579
We're pulling in some of the associates
on our class action case.

14:51.657 --> 14:53.750
Do you know what case
he's talking about?

14:53.826 --> 14:55.919
No, in fact, I don't. Mr. Stone?

14:55.995 --> 14:58.828
We're trying to move forward
with a class action suit

14:58.898 --> 15:02.994
- on behalf of inmates at Tipton Bay.
- Prisoners' rights class action?

15:03.068 --> 15:07.903
Well, this should get our Fortune-500
clients running back into the fold.

15:07.973 --> 15:10.407
- Marci.
- WPK is not Legal Aid.

15:10.476 --> 15:11.841
Recuse yourselves.

15:11.944 --> 15:14.606
That's not a decision
you can make unilaterally.

15:14.680 --> 15:17.171
- You're backing them?
- Supporting my attorneys.

15:17.249 --> 15:19.342
This firm doesn't cut and run.

15:19.418 --> 15:22.910
We don't throw good money
after bad, either.

15:22.988 --> 15:27.425
It is gratifying to see your commitment
to pro bono work.

15:27.493 --> 15:30.621
However, this case being pro bono,

15:30.696 --> 15:34.063
your time on it will not count
towards the 75 hours a week

15:34.133 --> 15:37.193
you're expected to bill.

15:37.269 --> 15:40.432
Now who's interested
in assisting Mr. Stone?

15:47.980 --> 15:51.541
You brought me a gay chimp case?
Seriously?

15:51.617 --> 15:54.381
Steve is literally dying
of a broken heart.

15:54.486 --> 15:56.044
And I'm empathetic.

15:56.121 --> 15:58.885
But if the DA doesn't see
any merit in this case...

15:58.958 --> 16:01.392
We'll petition
to be their guardians ad litem.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.087
And get shot down.

16:03.162 --> 16:05.995
- These are chimps, not kids.
- More similar than you think.

16:06.065 --> 16:09.125
Have you heard of the Theory
of Chimpanzee Tort Protection?

16:10.836 --> 16:13.964
Let's go out on a limb
and say that I haven't.

16:14.039 --> 16:16.803
Well, Your Honor, the CTP,
as it's known in some circles,

16:16.909 --> 16:18.672
including the Harvard Law Review,

16:18.744 --> 16:22.510
argues that because of similarities
between chimpanzees and humans,

16:22.581 --> 16:25.345
emotionally, behaviorally and morally...

16:25.417 --> 16:26.782
And genetically.

16:26.852 --> 16:30.151
Humans and chimps share
over 95 percent of the same active DNA.

16:30.222 --> 16:32.190
There is therefore a legal obligation

16:32.257 --> 16:35.749
to extend civil rights protection
to our cousins, the chimps.

16:35.828 --> 16:39.924
Your Honor, you're not seriously
considering this ridiculous theory.

16:39.999 --> 16:43.696
I will. After I hear
oral arguments on the case.

16:43.769 --> 16:45.862
Two o'clock tomorrow.

16:46.805 --> 16:50.366
We'll get thrown out of court
unless we prove a connection between

16:50.476 --> 16:53.001
prisoners in the infirmary
and those who speak out.

16:53.078 --> 16:56.047
Then we have to connect that group
to Warden Brown.

16:56.115 --> 16:57.412
Shouldn't be a problem.

16:57.483 --> 17:01.783
I mean, there's two of us and
only a gajillion pages of documents.

17:08.761 --> 17:12.527
You know, if that's your fiancé,
it's OK to talk to him in front of me.

17:12.631 --> 17:13.790
I know that.

17:17.469 --> 17:21.337
Hey, sweetie.
Yeah, another late night.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.773
W... I'll call you in a little bit.

17:25.377 --> 17:26.935
I love you too.

17:29.081 --> 17:31.049
If you want to talk to him, that's...

17:31.150 --> 17:33.516
No, he gets it.
Scott's really awesome.

17:33.619 --> 17:34.745
Hmm.

17:34.820 --> 17:36.651
- What, hmm?
- Nothing.

17:36.722 --> 17:39.054
It's not nothing.
Hmm. That meant something.

17:39.124 --> 17:41.149
No. I mean, hmm,
like, that's interesting

17:41.226 --> 17:44.718
because you never mentioned Scott
before you got engaged.

17:44.797 --> 17:46.526
Well, you knew I had a boyfriend.

17:46.598 --> 17:49.931
You have to admit the whole
engagement thing came out of nowhere.

17:50.002 --> 17:53.563
No, it didn't. It came out of Ohio.

17:53.639 --> 17:57.939
I... I went back home, and it
re-prioritized a lot of things for me.

17:58.010 --> 18:01.070
I realized I'd...
you know, I'd been distracted lately.

18:01.146 --> 18:03.512
Not by you.
I know that's what you're thinking.

18:03.615 --> 18:06.778
- Well, I...
- But by work and stuff.

18:07.953 --> 18:10.046
Good, I'm glad.

18:10.122 --> 18:13.853
Because I'd hate to think you did
something as severe as get engaged

18:13.926 --> 18:17.089
as a reaction to... whatever.

18:17.196 --> 18:19.027
I didn't.

18:23.602 --> 18:26.537
You just tell the court
exactly what you told me.

18:26.605 --> 18:29.904
You wrote letters about sewage
in your cell, they had you beaten up.

18:29.975 --> 18:32.705
That's what happened.
Got the 22 stitches to prove it.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.746
Thanks, Luis. I'll see you in court.

18:34.847 --> 18:37.008
- Thank you.
- All right.

18:49.495 --> 18:51.156
What are you doing here?

18:51.230 --> 18:54.791
- You ask me that every time you see me?
- Every time? Twice in ten years.

18:54.900 --> 18:56.834
They offered you five years.

18:56.902 --> 18:59.336
Good behavior,
you'd have been out of here now.

18:59.404 --> 19:03.033
You wouldn't agree to five weeks
if it was a crime you didn't do.

19:03.108 --> 19:06.271
But I turn your five years down,
and you just stop fighting.

19:06.345 --> 19:09.508
I did fight. We lost.

19:09.581 --> 19:11.947
I told you that was the risk
of going to trial.

19:12.050 --> 19:14.314
You had no one
who backed up your alibi.

19:14.820 --> 19:17.789
Where's the other lawyer? Where's Stone?

19:17.890 --> 19:20.859
He's working the case back
at the office. I'm taking depos.

19:20.959 --> 19:23.325
I'm the guy you got now, David.

19:23.395 --> 19:25.829
There's no one else coming.

19:50.989 --> 19:54.356
Second year I was here,
my cellmate's appendix burst.

19:55.327 --> 19:58.660
They waited a day and a half
before getting him to a doctor.

19:58.730 --> 20:00.823
I filed a complaint.

20:00.899 --> 20:03.993
- What happened?
- Got transferred to E-wing.

20:04.069 --> 20:07.766
Me and 25 members of the Aryan Nation.

20:08.907 --> 20:13.241
Punctured lung, broken arm
in two places, and I got off easy.

20:13.312 --> 20:16.475
My cellmate with the appendix
died that night.

20:18.750 --> 20:21.310
- It's unbelievable.
- Yeah, we should keep going.

20:21.386 --> 20:25.288
I got ten years
worth of stories to tell.

20:31.396 --> 20:33.023
How are we doing?

20:33.098 --> 20:34.463
- Great.
- Fantastic.

20:34.533 --> 20:38.435
Have you been to the Web site today?
Have you seen the new pictures of Steve?

20:38.503 --> 20:41.995
He's getting sicker.
He's looking all pale.

20:42.074 --> 20:45.237
But still a chimp. Which,
end of the day, is our whole problem.

20:45.344 --> 20:48.245
We're going to
have to drop this case, Patti.

20:48.313 --> 20:53.182
Don't you "Patti" me. Everyone knows
you are a meat-eating animal-hater.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.742
- That's not...
- What?

20:54.820 --> 20:59.450
How many of God's creatures had to die
to make your shoes?

20:59.524 --> 21:03.153
- I don't know.
- You mean you don't even like?

21:04.029 --> 21:05.963
Stone did this. I don't believe you.

21:06.031 --> 21:09.091
The only reason you took this case
was to piss off your ex.

21:09.167 --> 21:12.261
The whole reason you took it
was to try and get me back into bed.

21:12.337 --> 21:15.170
Knock it off, both of you.
I don't care how you got here!

21:15.240 --> 21:17.572
But this is what this case is about.

21:17.643 --> 21:21.409
Now you put those high-priced
law degrees to work!

21:21.480 --> 21:23.107
I'll be outside.

21:23.181 --> 21:28.016
But no one leaves until you figure out
how you're going to save my chimps.

21:33.558 --> 21:35.458
Well...

21:35.527 --> 21:36.892
Get to work!

21:41.600 --> 21:44.501
- So, you're really going back at it?
- Just one more hour.

21:44.569 --> 21:45.729
Yeah. Here.

21:46.705 --> 21:48.832
Thanks. See you tomorrow.

22:06.792 --> 22:09.226
I wouldn't be standing here right now

22:09.294 --> 22:10.989
looking out at the sea of faces,

22:12.064 --> 22:15.431
of hope, tens of thousand strong,

22:16.368 --> 22:20.304
if it weren't for the people
whose lives touched mine years ago.

22:20.372 --> 22:23.068
People like Daryl Rhodes.

22:25.110 --> 22:29.046
Daryl Rhodes, the man
whose single courageous voice

22:29.114 --> 22:31.480
helped me change Tipton Bay.

22:32.551 --> 22:34.917
And Keith Bennett.

22:36.555 --> 22:38.853
The lawyer who never forgot about me.

22:40.092 --> 22:43.459
Who stood by me and propped me up
when I was falling.

22:45.764 --> 22:47.493
Oh, my God.

23:03.148 --> 23:05.878
Pete was born in the wild, in Uganda.

23:05.951 --> 23:09.853
And at three months old, he saw
his mother killed by poachers.

23:09.921 --> 23:12.412
Fortunately, some conservationists
found him.

23:12.491 --> 23:15.517
But he never formed an attachment
until he came to our zoo.

23:15.594 --> 23:17.084
That attachment was to Steve?

23:17.162 --> 23:19.995
Chimps usually are threatened
by newcomers to a group.

23:20.065 --> 23:23.523
But Steve, slight, already
a bit of an outsider himself,

23:23.602 --> 23:25.832
had an immediate rapport with Pete.

23:25.904 --> 23:31.035
Steve brought Pete food, he groomed him,
and they slept together every night.

23:31.109 --> 23:34.044
And by "sleeping with"...

23:36.748 --> 23:38.841
You remind him of his mother.

23:40.419 --> 23:42.717
That's so sweet.

23:44.356 --> 23:47.883
So when you say that Pete and Steve
slept together, you mean...

23:47.959 --> 23:50.792
They literally slept together,
in each other's arms.

23:50.862 --> 23:54.423
But, yes, there was
sexual activity too,

23:54.499 --> 23:57.229
which is ultimately
why they were separated.

23:57.302 --> 24:01.762
- And since the separation?
- Steve has stopped eating.

24:01.840 --> 24:03.933
He's lost weight.

24:04.009 --> 24:06.569
He's developed bleeding ulcers

24:06.645 --> 24:09.170
and, uh, self-inflicted wounds.

24:10.615 --> 24:14.278
Like all social primates,
Steve craves a connection.

24:14.352 --> 24:18.516
And Pete was that connection,
and without him, he is heartbroken.

24:18.623 --> 24:21.786
Steve the chimp is heartbroken.

24:22.394 --> 24:23.520
Is that a Pixar movie?

24:26.465 --> 24:30.231
So chimps are human, just shorter,
stupider and with more hair.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.133
You just described my ex-husband.

24:32.204 --> 24:36.504
Chimpanzees are genetically closer
to humans than they are to other apes.

24:36.575 --> 24:39.339
Didn't Pete bite you two years ago?

24:40.579 --> 24:42.547
He was just excited.
That was my fault.

24:42.614 --> 24:45.481
I had food in my pocket
when I went into the habitat.

24:45.550 --> 24:48.849
I assume you called the police
and pressed charges against Pete?

24:48.920 --> 24:50.683
- Of course not.
- Why not?

24:50.755 --> 24:53.121
I mean, if we're giving animals
legal rights,

24:53.225 --> 24:56.490
shouldn't we be giving them
the same responsibilities, hmm?

24:57.762 --> 25:00.026
Why didn't you call the police?

25:00.098 --> 25:01.861
Becau...

25:04.436 --> 25:06.666
Because that would have been silly.

25:06.738 --> 25:08.831
Well, I trust your judgment.

25:09.641 --> 25:11.666
You seem to be an expert on "silly. "

25:17.782 --> 25:21.343
I've served 13 years
of a 25-years-to-life sentence.

25:21.419 --> 25:24.354
- What about parole?
- I haven't had a single hearing.

25:24.422 --> 25:25.980
You eligible after ten years?

25:26.091 --> 25:29.390
My hearing was denied
because of disciplinary infractions.

25:29.461 --> 25:31.588
What did you do, Luis?

25:37.402 --> 25:40.769
I stole some cigarettes,
I got into a fight with another inmate.

25:40.872 --> 25:42.237
It was my fault.

25:46.811 --> 25:49.075
I know that's
what the prison report says,

25:49.147 --> 25:52.810
but could you tell the court
what you told Mr. Bennett.

25:52.884 --> 25:55.250
It was my fault.
Just like I said in the report.

25:55.353 --> 25:58.186
- Seek to treat this witness as hostile.
- What basis?

25:58.256 --> 26:00.884
The witness is recanting
his entire sworn affidavit.

26:00.959 --> 26:02.324
Mr. Calderon,

26:02.394 --> 26:06.558
you realize that if you fail to tell
the truth, you face perjury charges?

26:07.732 --> 26:09.996
Is this your signature? Right here.

26:10.068 --> 26:14.562
Under the line that says "signed under
the pains and penalties of perjury"?

26:14.639 --> 26:18.803
I never signed this page.
I don't know where you got this at.

26:20.612 --> 26:21.840
He got to them.

26:21.913 --> 26:24.882
- We have nine more inmates.
- It's just gonna be the same.

26:24.950 --> 26:27.316
We find more evidence
the warden coerced them

26:27.385 --> 26:29.046
into changing their testimony.

26:29.120 --> 26:31.680
- Are you always this naive?
- OK, let's not panic.

26:31.756 --> 26:34.486
Not that I'm saying
it's not a perfectly good time to,

26:34.559 --> 26:36.789
but we have
the mountain of files to go over.

26:36.861 --> 26:41.230
Look, why don't you guys head on back?
I'll be there in a minute.

26:54.145 --> 26:56.010
I'm sorry.

26:56.081 --> 26:59.949
It's not your fault.
Warden's got the upper hand.

27:00.018 --> 27:02.782
And he's not afraid
to smack anybody around with it.

27:02.854 --> 27:07.120
I'm not talking about the warden.
I'm talking about me. Ten years ago.

27:07.759 --> 27:09.784
It's a little late for "I'm sorry. "

27:09.861 --> 27:13.820
I know. I know.
But I was young and I thought...

27:13.898 --> 27:15.365
You thought I was guilty.

27:16.267 --> 27:20.363
Easy to do. The evidence against you,
your attitude, you didn't make it easy.

27:20.438 --> 27:22.201
That's some apology.

27:23.441 --> 27:27.775
Look, the point is that
I should have looked past all that.

27:27.846 --> 27:30.781
A guilty man deserves
the same defense as an innocent man.

27:30.849 --> 27:32.180
That's my job.

27:35.120 --> 27:36.849
And I didn't do it.

27:41.993 --> 27:44.655
If I knew what kind of needle
you were looking for,

27:44.729 --> 27:47.664
maybe I could help you find it
in the haystack.

27:47.732 --> 27:50.792
Something about somebody
called Daryl Rhodes,

27:50.869 --> 27:52.427
and I have no idea who he is,

27:52.537 --> 27:55.267
so there's no point in both of us
wasting our time.

27:55.340 --> 27:58.639
It's not a waste when two sets of eyes
are better than just...

27:58.710 --> 28:00.974
Just go home, OK?

28:01.613 --> 28:02.705
Eli, what?

28:02.781 --> 28:04.908
Seriously, Maggie, just get out of here.

28:04.983 --> 28:07.543
I don't want you
to cancel your life for me.

28:08.119 --> 28:09.643
"Cancel my life"?

28:11.322 --> 28:14.485
I don't want to be the reason
you and your boyfriend break up.

28:14.592 --> 28:17.152
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Nothing.

28:17.228 --> 28:19.719
I'm just...

28:19.798 --> 28:21.663
I'm really tired and...

28:23.301 --> 28:26.668
Maybe we don't need
to spend quite so much alone time.

28:29.541 --> 28:30.803
OK.

28:32.377 --> 28:35.739
Good night.

28:48.493 --> 28:50.859
Eli. Eli.

28:52.664 --> 28:55.895
- Eli!
- Could you yell a little louder, maybe?

28:57.435 --> 28:59.528
You're still looking for Daryl Rhodes?

28:59.604 --> 29:03.267
- Unfortunately, right.
- Well, I brought help.

29:19.357 --> 29:21.222
Boxes and boxes of documents.

29:21.292 --> 29:24.955
Affidavits from inmates which counsel
can't seem to get the inmates

29:25.029 --> 29:27.589
- to testify in support of.
- They've been coerced.

29:27.699 --> 29:30.395
Really? Then why not
produce evidence of that?

29:31.770 --> 29:34.238
- Oh, thank God.
- What was that, Mr. Stone?

29:34.305 --> 29:37.672
Your Honor,
I'd like to call another witness.

29:37.776 --> 29:41.542
Would this be an actual witness
or more testimony by affidavit?

29:41.646 --> 29:45.013
An actual witness. Mr. Daryl Rhodes.

29:49.587 --> 29:52.818
Mr. Rhodes, would you state
your occupation for the record?

29:53.558 --> 29:57.460
Until last March, I was
administrative assistant to Warden Brown

29:57.529 --> 30:00.760
at the Tipton Bay
State Correctional Facility.

30:00.832 --> 30:01.890
Why'd you leave?

30:01.966 --> 30:05.663
I got tired of not
being able to sleep through the night.

30:05.737 --> 30:08.501
What was keeping you up, Mr. Rhodes?

30:08.573 --> 30:10.473
Things in the prison.

30:10.542 --> 30:14.603
Uh... overcrowding. Double-celling.

30:14.679 --> 30:18.581
Substandard living conditions,
even for a prison.

30:20.084 --> 30:23.451
And if an inmate ever
complained about any of that...

30:25.256 --> 30:29.022
...the warden would have me
transfer him to another wing.

30:29.127 --> 30:30.958
What's so wrong with that?

30:33.731 --> 30:37.462
It was always a part of the prison
where hostile inmates were housed.

30:38.603 --> 30:42.266
A black inmate
to Aryan Brotherhood territory.

30:42.340 --> 30:46.276
Or a white inmate
to where the Latin Disciples were.

30:46.945 --> 30:49.971
And what would happen
if the transferred inmate

30:50.048 --> 30:52.608
didn't get along with his new neighbors?

30:52.717 --> 30:57.677
Well, to a man,
they'd end up in the infirmary.

30:59.824 --> 31:03.191
Mr. Rhodes, I've been through
every transfer, every record,

31:03.294 --> 31:06.161
every sheet of paper
produced to me by Tipton Bay.

31:06.231 --> 31:09.462
I didn't find anything
to document what you're describing.

31:09.534 --> 31:12.833
Well, that's because
there was never anything in writing.

31:12.904 --> 31:16.772
The warden would just
call me into his office

31:16.841 --> 31:19.776
and, uh... I'd get it done.

31:22.180 --> 31:24.705
And afterward,

31:24.782 --> 31:28.718
would the inmates ever complain
about conditions at the prison again?

31:32.724 --> 31:34.658
No, sir.

31:35.927 --> 31:37.394
Your Honor.

31:38.730 --> 31:41.460
Your Honor,
there are no words to describe

31:41.532 --> 31:43.830
how violently opposed I am to this.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.462
To call it a stunt
would be a disservice to the word.

31:46.537 --> 31:48.437
Ms. Bonilla made a very good point.

31:48.506 --> 31:50.633
With rights come legal responsibility,

31:50.708 --> 31:54.235
including responsibility
to support one's case with testimony.

31:54.312 --> 31:58.373
Which presumes the witness can testify,
which presumes the witness can speak.

31:58.449 --> 32:00.883
Then what possible harm could there be?

32:00.952 --> 32:04.615
She's got you, Ms. Bonilla.

32:04.689 --> 32:06.657
Ms. Wethersby, call your witness.

32:06.758 --> 32:09.249
Thank you, Your Honor.
We call Pete the Chimp.

32:09.327 --> 32:11.056
- No. This is a joke.
- Step back.

32:27.011 --> 32:29.912
What do we do now? Do we make him
swear an oath on the Bible?

32:29.981 --> 32:32.745
I think we can presume
truthful testimony here.

32:32.817 --> 32:35.285
Do you have any questions
for your witness?

32:35.353 --> 32:37.480
Just two, Your Honor.

32:41.225 --> 32:43.591
Look Pete, it's Steve.

32:52.770 --> 32:54.533
Pete, do you miss Steve?

32:59.277 --> 33:02.007
Pete, do you want to see Steve?

33:12.590 --> 33:15.081
And it's another chimp.
Why not?

33:15.159 --> 33:16.649
Whoo!

33:28.106 --> 33:31.667
Pete and Steve haven't seen each other
since they've been separated.

33:31.776 --> 33:35.678
I think it's pretty obvious how genuine
their affection for each other is.

33:35.747 --> 33:38.807
The problem is, of course,
Pete and Steve are just chimps.

33:38.883 --> 33:43.718
And if I were to rule in your favor,
I would be creating new law here.

33:43.788 --> 33:46.518
And my ruling would most undoubtedly

33:46.591 --> 33:49.856
be laughed at
and overturned in six months.

33:52.830 --> 33:55.128
Could even be a year.

33:55.199 --> 33:58.362
During which time,
Pete and Steve would be together.

33:58.970 --> 34:00.699
Your Honor, don't do that.

34:00.772 --> 34:04.139
I rule in favor of the plaintiffs.

34:04.208 --> 34:06.870
Separation of these chimps
causes undue harm

34:06.944 --> 34:11.074
under the theory
of Chimpanzee Tort Protection.

34:11.149 --> 34:14.016
They made that up! They made that up!

34:14.085 --> 34:16.382
Something you'll point out
in the appeal.

34:16.454 --> 34:19.581
It'll take almost a month
for you to draft and file.

34:23.561 --> 34:27.998
I've been authorized by the DOC
to make an offer to settle.

34:28.065 --> 34:33.025
For starters, Mr. Mosely sees the inside
of a parole hearing room and pronto.

34:33.103 --> 34:35.629
- Then the matter of damages.
- Give me a number.

34:35.706 --> 34:37.264
How much would it cost to comply

34:37.375 --> 34:41.333
with the governor's prison crowding
and recidivism initiatives?

34:41.411 --> 34:45.246
- Millions, I imagine.
- Well, there you go.

34:51.155 --> 34:55.056
We'll work out a number and get back
to you. Do we have a deal in principle?

34:55.126 --> 34:58.789
You do. If the Department of Corrections
fires Warden Brown

34:58.863 --> 35:02.128
and promises not to employ him
anywhere within the organization.

35:02.200 --> 35:05.169
- You're out of your mind.
- That's not something I can do.

35:05.269 --> 35:07.760
You can, and I'm gonna tell you why.

35:10.975 --> 35:14.672
Everything we're talking about,
the parole hearing for David Mosely,

35:14.745 --> 35:16.235
the money for prison reform,

35:16.314 --> 35:19.875
is meaningless if he's in charge
of so much as a paper clip.

35:19.951 --> 35:23.819
He used Tipton Bay like a weapon,
beating inmates with it.

35:23.888 --> 35:27.380
His only involvement in the correctional
system should be as an inmate,

35:27.458 --> 35:30.427
which, by the way, is our next move
if he doesn't resign.

35:30.528 --> 35:33.429
We drive Daryl Rhodes
to the district attorney's office

35:33.498 --> 35:35.932
where he swears
an affidavit against Mr. Brown.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.093
This really is a question for you, sir.

35:38.169 --> 35:41.195
Are you gonna resign,
or do I go get my car?

35:52.617 --> 35:54.847
- What do you think?
- Nice.

35:56.320 --> 35:58.481
I think I see a guy on a horse.

36:00.358 --> 36:02.918
Congratulations
on the Tipton Bay settlement.

36:02.994 --> 36:05.861
Thank you. And thanks for supporting me.

36:05.930 --> 36:08.990
I know I put you in an uncomfortable
position with Ms. Klein.

36:09.066 --> 36:13.230
Whatever position I may or may not be in
with Ms. Klein, uncomfortable or not,

36:13.304 --> 36:14.862
it's none of your concern.

36:16.774 --> 36:19.038
I'm hoping this
is a personal acquisition,

36:19.110 --> 36:21.044
not for the WPK collection.

36:22.947 --> 36:26.110
Congratulations on your moral victory.

36:26.184 --> 36:27.446
Thank you.

36:27.518 --> 36:29.850
It's almost worth
the two computer companies

36:29.921 --> 36:32.082
and three department store chains
we lost

36:32.156 --> 36:36.024
due to our new
"we heart criminals" reputation.

36:36.093 --> 36:38.561
- That's regrettable.
- We'll survive.

36:38.629 --> 36:42.190
The fact that David Mosely
will be staying put at Tipton Bay

36:42.266 --> 36:43.824
helps to contain the damage.

36:43.901 --> 36:46.267
Actually, the board
granted David's parole.

36:46.370 --> 36:49.897
True... but the governor denied it.

36:56.013 --> 36:57.275
Did you do that?

36:57.982 --> 37:01.213
Only in that I voted for him.

37:01.285 --> 37:04.118
If you'd like to discuss this matter
with me further,

37:04.188 --> 37:07.646
I've taken over two offices
on the 20th floor.

37:08.693 --> 37:11.560
I'll be here for the duration.

37:21.239 --> 37:23.673
I don't know what to say.

37:23.741 --> 37:25.265
There's nothing to say.

37:25.343 --> 37:27.777
I don't know if I could do it.

37:29.747 --> 37:32.113
Take that kind of hit and keep going.

37:32.183 --> 37:36.119
That's what living brave's all about.
I got another shot at parole next year.

37:36.187 --> 37:38.485
And the year after that.

37:42.326 --> 37:43.759
You came through, man.

37:48.366 --> 37:50.095
Bought you something.

37:55.006 --> 37:57.566
Black's Law Dictionary.
Heard of it?

37:57.675 --> 38:01.975
- Yeah. It's for lawyers.
- And guys looking to make parole.

38:02.046 --> 38:06.574
I figure I can make it down here once,
twice a month.

38:06.651 --> 38:09.415
We can go through it.

38:09.487 --> 38:12.251
My own personal law school?

38:12.323 --> 38:14.814
Yeah, something like that.

38:20.564 --> 38:22.122
Where do we start?

38:24.101 --> 38:25.261
Um...

38:29.707 --> 38:32.642
Here. "Habeas corpus. "

38:32.710 --> 38:35.838
It's Latin. It means
to "produce the body. "

38:35.913 --> 38:38.848
But legally this
is the most important safeguard

38:38.916 --> 38:41.680
to all of our individual freedoms.

38:45.089 --> 38:49.219
This really is Chimp Paradise.
They weren't kidding when they named it.

38:49.293 --> 38:50.817
They're going to love it here.

38:50.895 --> 38:53.625
I can't believe
the zoo agreed to release them.

38:53.698 --> 38:56.963
What people will do to avoid
watching two monkeys get it on...

38:57.034 --> 38:58.331
They're chimps.

38:58.402 --> 39:00.097
It's time.

39:00.171 --> 39:02.435
Someone wants to say goodbye.

39:02.506 --> 39:05.270
- And thank you.
- Wait until they see their bill.

39:07.611 --> 39:10.171
Bye, guys. Have a good life.

39:12.516 --> 39:15.007
I'm gonna take them in.
Want to see the habitat?

39:15.086 --> 39:17.213
Oh, you know I'm coming.

39:17.288 --> 39:19.256
I've got a great view from here.

39:25.896 --> 39:28.262
You know, you act like
you don't like chimps,

39:28.366 --> 39:31.426
but deep down, you kind of like us.

39:33.704 --> 39:36.332
Do you know the restaurant,
Le Petite Table?

39:36.407 --> 39:38.500
Napa Valley. Six-month waiting list.

39:38.576 --> 39:41.409
Have to know Bill Gates to get in.
That Le Petite Table?

39:41.479 --> 39:43.811
If you can get us a reservation
next Saturday,

39:43.881 --> 39:45.314
I'll have dinner with you.

39:47.785 --> 39:50.413
You sure you wouldn't settle
for French fries?

39:51.589 --> 39:53.819
All right. Had to take a shot.

40:02.633 --> 40:05.693
How are you still standing?
You've been here 36 hours.

40:05.770 --> 40:07.704
I have no idea.

40:08.606 --> 40:11.074
- I heard about David.
- Yeah.

40:12.109 --> 40:13.940
We made a difference, Eli.

40:14.011 --> 40:16.946
The warden's gone.
The prison's already turning around.

40:17.014 --> 40:19.574
Yeah. It's just...

40:20.684 --> 40:22.743
I had a picture in my head, you know.

40:23.888 --> 40:28.052
David was gonna get out and go on
to do some pretty amazing things.

40:28.159 --> 40:30.650
We don't know
what's going to happen, Eli.

40:30.728 --> 40:33.094
That's why they call it the future.

40:37.868 --> 40:39.358
Hi, sweetie.

40:41.839 --> 40:43.397
I'll take the next one.

40:52.650 --> 40:55.551
And I wouldn't be
standing here right now

40:55.619 --> 40:59.715
if it weren't for the people
whose lives touched mine years ago.

40:59.790 --> 41:03.851
People like
my very good friend, Eli Stone.

41:13.804 --> 41:17.262
The man whose words and deeds
reminded us

41:17.341 --> 41:21.300
that there is no faith without hope,

41:22.246 --> 41:24.305
no justice without compassion,

41:25.483 --> 41:27.576
no humanity without fairness.

41:28.352 --> 41:32.220
The man who reminded us
that every one of us,

41:33.257 --> 41:37.785
the least of us, is still divine.

41:38.362 --> 41:40.728
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you,

41:40.831 --> 41:44.597
the man we've all come here
to see tonight...

41:44.702 --> 41:46.670
...Eli Stone.

42:03.053 --> 42:05.681
Live brave! Live brave! Live brave!
