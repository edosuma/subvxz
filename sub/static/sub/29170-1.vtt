13:46.720 --> 13:48.757
Oh, it was, for a while.

13:48.840 --> 13:51.275
Then some kid went missing,

One of the first families to settle here
in the late 19th century.

14:40.480 --> 14:43.791
Built the paper mill
that pretty much put this town on the map.

14:46.440 --> 14:48.511
We could at least look for some stairs.

14:51.240 --> 14:53.596
Yep. JJust as I thought.

14:53.680 --> 14:56.149
They got this place locked up
pretty tight.

14:56.240 --> 14:57.720
Anyone got a pen?

14:59.240 --> 15:02.074
Meet Lola. She is madly in love with me.

15:02.160 --> 15:03.435
Yeah, your hand maybe.

15:04.080 --> 15:06.959
- Nice.
- Lola! Hey, what?

15:18.680 --> 15:21.752
He's so much dreamier than you.

15:34.960 --> 15:36.713
The Bellows had a secret.

15:36.800 --> 15:39.440
A daughter that they never allowed
to leave the house.

15:39.520 --> 15:42.274
The myth is that there was something
really off about her.

15:42.360 --> 15:44.113
A really scary part

15:44.200 --> 15:47.796
is that her family erased her
from every single portrait.

15:47.880 --> 15:52.238
To this day,
nobody's ever found a picture of Sarah.

15:57.760 --> 15:59.194
They disowned her.

16:04.040 --> 16:06.839
- Better run, clown, better run.
- Shit!

16:08.760 --> 16:10.831
Bet you can't catch me.

16:13.200 --> 16:16.671
Chuck, if you jump out at me,
I'm going to punch you in the throat.

16:17.600 --> 16:19.273
So, what happened to her?

16:19.360 --> 16:23.991
Kids would come from all over
in hopes to get a peek at Strange Sarah.

16:24.080 --> 16:28.632
And though they never saw her,
they could hear her.

16:28.720 --> 16:30.200
Through the wall.

16:32.080 --> 16:33.958
Sarah told them stories.

16:35.320 --> 16:36.959
Scary stories.

16:40.680 --> 16:42.831
Some kids never returned home.

16:42.920 --> 16:44.673
Children around town died.

16:44.760 --> 16:46.991
Poisoned, they said.

16:47.080 --> 16:48.833
Everyone knew it was Sarah.

16:48.920 --> 16:51.958
But before the mob
could even get their hands on her,

16:52.040 --> 16:55.317
she'd already hung herself
with her own hair.

17:06.839 --> 17:08.957
And as the legend goes,

17:09.040 --> 17:11.794
if you come to the Bellows House at dark

17:11.880 --> 17:14.270
and ask Sarah to tell you a story,

17:14.359 --> 17:16.477
it'll be the last story you ever hear.

17:16.560 --> 17:18.790
Muah-ha-ha-ha!

17:27.319 --> 17:29.073
Oh, what's this?

17:35.720 --> 17:37.439
Push the other way.

17:37.520 --> 17:38.840
Push.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.639
No way.

18:26.280 --> 18:28.237
Well, that's it.

18:50.480 --> 18:52.039
Sarah's room.

18:55.360 --> 18:57.556
You're not going to scare me.

19:01.880 --> 19:03.234
Chuck?

19:06.640 --> 19:08.074
Chuck?

19:29.360 --> 19:30.874
What the...?

20:06.680 --> 20:09.673
What...? Where's the old lady?

20:09.760 --> 20:10.876
And the dog?

20:10.960 --> 20:12.155
What old lady?

20:14.960 --> 20:16.189
We gotta get out of here.

20:16.960 --> 20:20.192
Stella! Stella! We gotta get out of here!

20:20.320 --> 20:21.720
Stella, let's go!

20:22.440 --> 20:24.875
Guys, you've gotta see this! Come here!

20:31.400 --> 20:33.232
Who ordered the chicken?

20:33.320 --> 20:34.754
Shut up.

20:37.840 --> 20:39.672
This is where her family kept her.

20:39.800 --> 20:41.996
Locked her away from the world.

20:42.760 --> 20:45.320
All alone as some sort of freak.

20:45.400 --> 20:48.598
She must have just sat right here...

20:49.760 --> 20:53.037
and told her stories to the kids
through this wall.

20:53.120 --> 20:55.271
How have we never seen this before?

20:56.720 --> 20:59.315
I don't think anyone wanted us to.

21:21.320 --> 21:22.879
Can we get out of here now?

21:43.440 --> 21:45.238
What's that?

21:51.080 --> 21:53.037
I can't believe it.

21:53.120 --> 21:55.589
It's her book of scary stories.

21:55.680 --> 21:57.114
She had a book?

21:57.200 --> 21:59.456
There's no book
in the version of the myth I heard.

21:59.480 --> 22:01.949
The book is a part of every version
of the myth.

22:02.040 --> 22:03.520
And...

22:03.600 --> 22:06.195
that it was written in children's blood.

22:06.280 --> 22:08.749
Well, kids died hearing these stories,
okay?

22:08.840 --> 22:11.799
Look, let's put it back where you found it
and let's just get out of here.

22:13.120 --> 22:15.874
- Oh, shit!
- I got it. Okay, everybody, just shut up.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.077
Oh, no! It's the old lady and the dog!

22:18.160 --> 22:19.640
Tommy, stop it, okay?

22:19.720 --> 22:20.836
Just let them out.

22:21.840 --> 22:22.856
Ruth, is that you?

22:22.880 --> 22:24.758
Will you open the door?

22:24.840 --> 22:27.639
Joke's over. If you don't open it...

22:27.720 --> 22:30.474
- You can't do this! Come on!
- ...I'll tell the chief.

22:33.440 --> 22:35.113
Why would you do that?

22:36.200 --> 22:38.999
This isn't funny. Tommy, come on.

22:39.080 --> 22:41.072
It's my little brother.

22:43.120 --> 22:44.190
Please.

22:45.240 --> 22:47.197
Open the damn door!

22:47.920 --> 22:48.920
Open it.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.356
Ruth! Tommy! Let us out!

22:56.160 --> 22:57.879
You're trash anyway.

22:59.920 --> 23:03.197
Tommy,
I'm sorry about the burning shit, man.

23:03.280 --> 23:05.636
I hope you find a way out.

23:05.720 --> 23:07.313
You good? Can you stand up?

23:07.400 --> 23:08.550
Yeah.

23:08.640 --> 23:11.075
- Get it off me!
- Oh, you're fine.

23:11.200 --> 23:12.680
- No! Get it off me!
- Hey.

23:13.920 --> 23:16.071
Get it off me! Get it off me!

23:16.160 --> 23:17.456
- You're fine.
- Something bit me!

23:17.480 --> 23:19.790
- Can you help?
- The spiders are gone.

23:19.880 --> 23:20.916
Thank you.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.753
Jesus, Auggie.
Okay, you're such a horndog.

23:22.880 --> 23:25.136
Can you lose your stiffy for a second
and help us get out?

23:25.160 --> 23:27.755
That's not funny. There's a lady present.

23:27.840 --> 23:29.957
Ladies... present.

23:32.200 --> 23:33.793
Come on. You gotta push harder.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.910
Sarah Bellows, tell me a story.

23:45.520 --> 23:47.079
Tell me a story.

23:47.160 --> 23:49.880
Sarah Bellows, tell me a story.

24:06.960 --> 24:09.077
Wait, wait.
I hear something. Someone's here.

24:09.160 --> 24:10.160
He came back.

24:11.160 --> 24:13.336
- Tommy!
- We're sorry. We're really sorry.

24:13.360 --> 24:15.511
I take back everything I ever said, man.

24:15.640 --> 24:16.994
Sorry, man.

24:17.080 --> 24:19.549
Tommy, please!

24:32.720 --> 24:34.757
Why would you date a psychopath like that?

24:34.840 --> 24:36.877
Better than fishing for turds.

24:38.520 --> 24:40.193
So who unlocked it?

24:40.280 --> 24:42.511
Who cares? Let's just get out of here.

24:42.600 --> 24:45.991
- Nice Pierrot costume.
- Thank you.

24:46.080 --> 24:47.355
See?

24:49.280 --> 24:50.794
Well, that was fun.

24:57.280 --> 24:58.760
Shit!

25:04.600 --> 25:06.512
I'm really sorry about all of this.

25:06.600 --> 25:10.560
- Why did he do this?
- This is low, even for Tommy.

25:10.640 --> 25:13.000
Like "farting in my milk carton
and making me drink it" low.

25:14.040 --> 25:15.918
It was the fifth grade.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.514
It was ninth.

25:17.600 --> 25:20.354
I can try and scrounge up
something to help.

25:20.440 --> 25:23.000
I got it. It's fine. Thank you, though.

25:23.080 --> 25:25.151
I'll just stay here until the morning.

25:25.240 --> 25:26.560
Get it into a shop.

25:28.200 --> 25:30.556
We have a sofa in the basement.

25:30.640 --> 25:32.154
You're welcome to use it.

25:35.560 --> 25:38.439
Hey, look,
I really don't want any trouble.

25:40.080 --> 25:42.675
We'll just have to be gone
before Dad gets up.

25:50.800 --> 25:54.032
<i>An AM/FM stereo table radio with auto...</i>

26:16.840 --> 26:18.911
Sam's pet turns out to be a sewer rat?

26:19.000 --> 26:21.674
- It's got some demons.
- It's not finished yet.

26:32.720 --> 26:35.155
I used to love these as a kid.
You collect them?

26:35.280 --> 26:38.034
Oh, I've read every single issue.

26:38.120 --> 26:39.554
Cover to cover.

26:42.640 --> 26:45.917
You know, if you're serious about
being a writer, you can't do it here.

26:47.240 --> 26:48.594
You gotta move to the city.

26:52.280 --> 26:53.919
I couldn't leave my dad.

27:05.120 --> 27:08.796
Uh, the, uh... basement is downstairs.

27:09.840 --> 27:12.400
Yeah, that's usually where they are.

28:20.080 --> 28:21.400
"Harold."

28:55.840 --> 28:57.957
Tommy Milner!

28:58.040 --> 29:00.794
It's late! Are you drunk again?

29:00.880 --> 29:01.950
It's Halloween.

29:02.040 --> 29:04.953
You were supposed to
deliver eggs to the Wolvertons.

29:06.480 --> 29:07.880
Now?

29:07.960 --> 29:09.679
Now!

29:18.480 --> 29:19.834
What?

29:21.440 --> 29:22.954
This is bullshit.

29:37.640 --> 29:40.360
"Tommy hated that scarecrow all his life.

29:40.440 --> 29:43.877
He took the eggs
and left for the last time."

29:45.400 --> 29:46.470
Tommy.

30:23.560 --> 30:25.199
Eat shit, Harold.

32:31.440 --> 32:32.510
Mom!

33:17.480 --> 33:18.834
Mom!

33:21.400 --> 33:23.039
Help me!

33:23.960 --> 33:25.440
Mom!

34:08.159 --> 34:09.879
Oh, my God.

34:09.960 --> 34:11.713
Will you look at this?

34:13.280 --> 34:16.079
I thought you were gonna be on your way,
stranger.

34:16.800 --> 34:17.835
I'm trying.

34:18.760 --> 34:20.672
Whew.

34:20.760 --> 34:23.228
You know,
no one's seen this high-school kid

34:23.320 --> 34:25.516
named Tommy Milner since last night.

34:25.600 --> 34:27.717
Witnesses say he got into a fight

34:27.800 --> 34:29.598
at the drive-in.

34:29.679 --> 34:33.196
Milner didn't do this to your car, did he?

34:36.440 --> 34:38.159
I never got your name.

34:40.280 --> 34:41.475
Ramon.

34:43.080 --> 34:44.719
Rodriguez.

34:46.199 --> 34:51.559
Look, I think it'd be a good idea
if you stuck around for a few days.

34:51.639 --> 34:53.199
<i>Comprende?</i>

34:54.840 --> 34:56.478
<i>Rodriguez.</i>

35:02.640 --> 35:04.472
It wasn't there before.

35:04.560 --> 35:05.960
The red ink was wet.

35:06.080 --> 35:09.391
And it did feel like blood.
It was thicker than ink.

35:09.480 --> 35:10.760
How could you eat that?

35:11.760 --> 35:15.037
Do you know how many body parts
are in there? Seven.

35:15.120 --> 35:16.440
I read it in a magazine.

35:17.440 --> 35:19.830
Cool. He turns into a scarecrow?

35:19.920 --> 35:21.354
Fresh twist.

35:21.440 --> 35:23.318
That's not a twist.

35:23.400 --> 35:25.790
I told you, the story, it...

35:26.360 --> 35:27.874
It just appeared.

35:28.800 --> 35:30.951
Tommy didn't even show up to school.

35:32.240 --> 35:34.550
It's like he just disappeared.

35:34.640 --> 35:37.474
Everyone knew he was eager
to go shoot some commies.

35:38.920 --> 35:43.278
Maybe he just, I don't know... left early?

35:43.360 --> 35:44.589
There was that room...

35:44.680 --> 35:46.114
Just drop it.

35:46.200 --> 35:47.634
No, tell me.

35:48.680 --> 35:53.755
In the house, when I was hiding,
the room was old... I mean new.

35:53.880 --> 35:56.076
Perfect, like when they lived there.
And I saw this...

35:56.160 --> 35:59.358
This old lady and this dog and they
were just staring at me with this look...

35:59.440 --> 36:00.640
Listen to yourselves.

36:00.720 --> 36:04.794
Nothing happened to us in that house
except for what Tommy did to us.

36:04.880 --> 36:07.270
If he's gone, good riddance.

36:08.520 --> 36:09.840
We should never have gone there.

36:09.920 --> 36:11.559
We should never have taken the book.

36:11.640 --> 36:16.157
You let a ghost story get into your heads.
That's all it is.

36:18.200 --> 36:20.669
I'm worried. Tommy wasn't at school.

36:20.760 --> 36:22.240
His name was in the book.

36:24.720 --> 36:27.280
I mean, there's no way
it's actually connected, right?

36:27.360 --> 36:28.840
Yeah, of course it's not.

36:33.040 --> 36:35.680
Stella,
I can't get mixed up with the police.

36:36.920 --> 36:38.434
I have to see it.

37:03.360 --> 37:05.795
It's what Tommy was wearing last night.

37:07.040 --> 37:09.157
Okay, what if this is Tommy,

37:09.240 --> 37:12.438
and what happens in the book
is exactly what's happened for real?

37:12.520 --> 37:14.557
Stop trying to scare me.

37:14.640 --> 37:16.279
It's just a scarecrow.

37:22.480 --> 37:25.200
- Did you hear about Tommy?
- He's missing.

37:59.320 --> 38:00.993
Here's your book back.

38:27.480 --> 38:28.709
You're home late.

38:30.160 --> 38:31.640
Picked up another shift?

38:32.360 --> 38:33.589
You have to?

38:34.760 --> 38:35.910
Can't say no.

38:38.840 --> 38:40.274
There's food in the fridge.

38:43.800 --> 38:45.280
Did you always work this much?

38:46.840 --> 38:48.399
Even when Mom was here?

38:52.120 --> 38:54.112
I heard the Milner boy didn't come home.

39:00.400 --> 39:02.790
Yeah. Everybody's been talking about it.

39:02.880 --> 39:05.952
Please just come straight home
next few days, okay?

39:07.400 --> 39:08.516
Yep.

39:16.840 --> 39:18.240
Ow.

39:21.600 --> 39:23.398
You got enough zit paint on there?

39:23.480 --> 39:26.120
It's a spider bite, you butt-pimple.

39:26.200 --> 39:27.350
A spider...

39:27.440 --> 39:29.193
Ah, damn it, my banana!

39:39.840 --> 39:41.479
I thought you were leaving.

39:43.840 --> 39:46.150
- Hope you're hungry.
- Oh, I'm starving. Thanks.

39:46.240 --> 39:49.358
You know, I can't stop thinking
about Tommy's disappearance.

39:49.440 --> 39:50.920
There has to be some...

39:54.840 --> 39:56.513
Where did you get that?

39:58.080 --> 40:00.720
It was just here on your bookshelf.

40:00.800 --> 40:03.360
No, I... I was just here. It wasn't.

40:03.440 --> 40:04.999
I took this back to the house.

40:05.080 --> 40:06.230
What?

40:09.480 --> 40:12.439
How did it get...?
How is it back here again?

40:19.320 --> 40:21.152
- What's happening?
- What the hell?

40:21.880 --> 40:23.712
How does that work?

40:23.800 --> 40:25.712
We've gotta make it stop.

40:32.560 --> 40:34.720
"A mother was digging
at the edge of the garden

40:34.800 --> 40:37.200
when she saw a big toe.
'It looks nice and plump, ' she said.

40:37.280 --> 40:39.749
'I'll put it in the stew.'"
What kind of story is that?

40:39.840 --> 40:40.840
What?

40:43.680 --> 40:44.716
Auggie.

40:46.800 --> 40:47.995
Auggie!

40:49.320 --> 40:50.640
<i>Pick up!</i>

40:50.760 --> 40:51.830
<i>Auggie!</i>

40:51.920 --> 40:54.594
No, there's nothing here.

40:54.720 --> 40:57.110
I told you, I mean,
the least you could have done

40:57.200 --> 40:59.999
was go to the store before
you and Jeff took off for the weekend.

41:00.080 --> 41:02.515
No, I'm not gonna call him "Dad."

41:07.440 --> 41:09.193
Okay, I'm eating the stew.

41:10.520 --> 41:12.113
The stew in the fridge?

41:13.120 --> 41:15.316
Yeah, well, someone made it.

41:15.400 --> 41:17.471
Okay, I'll see you when you get back.
Love you.

41:20.200 --> 41:22.317
<i>Auggie, pick up!</i>

41:27.040 --> 41:28.076
Hey, I'm eating.

41:28.160 --> 41:29.435
<i>Auggie!</i>

41:29.520 --> 41:30.715
Stella!

41:30.840 --> 41:32.593
Auggie, do not eat anything.

41:32.680 --> 41:34.319
<i>Listen, you're in the next story.</i>

41:34.400 --> 41:37.359
<i>Whatever you do, do not eat anything.</i>

41:41.640 --> 41:43.040
Har-har. Very funny.

41:44.120 --> 41:45.440
Did Chuck put you up to this?

41:45.520 --> 41:49.116
Auggie, this isn't a joke. Okay,
the story is writing itself right now.

41:49.200 --> 41:51.840
I don't know how or why,
but I'm reading it right here.

41:51.920 --> 41:53.479
<i>"A sound scared him. It was a voice.</i>

41:53.560 --> 41:55.677
And it called out, 'Who took my toe?'"

42:00.320 --> 42:03.279
<i>It's a corpse looking for her missing toe.</i>

42:03.360 --> 42:05.477
Yeah, I know this story.

42:05.560 --> 42:07.313
<i>My dad used to tell me this story.</i>

42:07.400 --> 42:09.392
<i>It scared me so much as a kid, but...</i>

42:09.480 --> 42:11.440
Am I not supposed to wait
for someone to say that?

42:11.480 --> 42:13.472
Because I don't hear anything.

42:13.560 --> 42:15.438
Listen, we're reading it right here.

42:15.520 --> 42:17.796
<i>"And then the voice grew louder.</i>

42:17.880 --> 42:20.475
<i>'Who took my toe?'"</i>

42:21.720 --> 42:23.393
<i>I'm all alone.</i>

42:27.440 --> 42:28.635
There's no voice.

42:28.720 --> 42:30.677
Yeah, well, there has to be a voice.

42:30.760 --> 42:32.991
You're the only one saying it.

42:37.120 --> 42:38.713
<i>Auggie!</i>

42:39.640 --> 42:40.790
<i>Auggie!</i>

42:42.360 --> 42:44.272
<i>Oh, no, Auggie, pick up.</i>

42:45.880 --> 42:47.599
<i>Auggie, don't eat anything.</i>

42:59.440 --> 43:00.556
<i>Auggie!</i>

43:00.680 --> 43:01.680
Oh, God.

43:01.720 --> 43:03.871
<i>Auggie. Auggie?</i>

43:09.800 --> 43:12.998
<i>Auggie? Come on, Auggie, pick up!</i>

43:15.360 --> 43:16.396
Did you hear that?

43:16.480 --> 43:18.278
Hear what? I don't hear anything.

43:20.720 --> 43:23.440
There was a toe in the stew.
A freaking toe.

43:27.240 --> 43:29.391
What does the book say happens next?

43:29.480 --> 43:31.597
<i>"August got very scared.</i>

43:32.480 --> 43:34.358
<i>But he thought,
'It doesn't know where I am.</i>

43:34.440 --> 43:36.159
<i>It'll never find me.'"</i>

43:37.280 --> 43:39.511
How does the book know that?

43:39.600 --> 43:41.717
"And then he heard the voice again."

43:45.440 --> 43:47.875
<i>Who...</i>

43:47.960 --> 43:48.996
<i>took...</i>

43:50.120 --> 43:51.600
<i>my...</i>

43:51.680 --> 43:52.796
<i>"...toe?"</i>

43:58.720 --> 44:00.837
<i>Auggie, just get out of the house!</i>

44:09.360 --> 44:10.960
He's only a couple blocks away.

44:44.560 --> 44:46.199
Who...

44:47.680 --> 44:49.319
took...

44:50.680 --> 44:52.637
my...

44:53.840 --> 44:55.399
toe?

45:00.320 --> 45:02.391
Come on, come on.

46:44.640 --> 46:45.640
Auggie?

46:46.720 --> 46:47.836
Auggie!

46:50.360 --> 46:51.430
Auggie!

47:06.360 --> 47:08.397
Tommy! Tommy Milner!

47:08.480 --> 47:11.871
<i>And as if this year
hasn't been grim enough already,</i>

47:11.960 --> 47:14.680
<i>we have a disappearance
on our hands, friends.</i>

47:14.760 --> 47:16.513
<i>Our own Tommy Milner,</i>

47:16.600 --> 47:20.037
<i>right here in little Mill Valley.</i>

47:27.720 --> 47:29.677
I was the one that found the book.

47:29.760 --> 47:31.558
I took it home.

47:31.640 --> 47:33.359
This is not your fault.

47:35.400 --> 47:36.550
You know...

47:37.880 --> 47:42.432
I caused every single bad thing
that happened in my life.

47:44.440 --> 47:46.079
My mom leaving.

47:47.640 --> 47:48.915
And now Auggie.

47:50.600 --> 47:52.193
None of that is true.

47:58.520 --> 48:01.319
Sorry we're late.
Ruth ran out of zit paint.

48:01.440 --> 48:03.477
I swear,
if you weren't so stressful to deal with

48:03.560 --> 48:05.677
in the first place, I wouldn't have zits.

48:05.760 --> 48:07.240
What's so urgent?

48:08.480 --> 48:10.039
Where's Auggie?

48:10.120 --> 48:11.634
Auggie's gone.

48:11.720 --> 48:13.359
Another story was written.

48:14.400 --> 48:15.880
Right in front of our eyes.

48:16.840 --> 48:18.320
I don't get it.

48:19.120 --> 48:20.270
What is this?

48:22.720 --> 48:24.279
This is a stale joke.

48:25.120 --> 48:26.634
Halloween's over.

48:26.720 --> 48:28.518
Where the hell is Auggie?

48:29.760 --> 48:31.160
We don't know.

48:31.240 --> 48:34.916
His parents are traveling,
and he's just gone.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.231
What do you mean, you don't know?
Okay, let's find him.

48:37.320 --> 48:39.232
I don't think he's coming back.

48:40.920 --> 48:44.152
- First, Tommy disappeared.
- I knew something happened.

48:44.240 --> 48:46.800
- Saw that old lady...
- And then now Auggie.

48:48.520 --> 48:51.592
They had their stories in the book,

48:51.680 --> 48:55.037
and it happens every night.

48:55.160 --> 48:56.879
Jesus, he ate a toe?

49:00.160 --> 49:01.799
You don't read the book.

49:03.040 --> 49:04.394
The book reads you.

49:07.760 --> 49:11.470
I'm afraid that we woke something up.

49:11.560 --> 49:14.234
That the same thing is gonna happen
to all of us.

49:17.240 --> 49:19.232
We were all in that house.

49:20.760 --> 49:23.514
No, this isn't real, okay?

49:23.600 --> 49:25.592
Stories can't hurt you.

49:25.680 --> 49:28.639
Sarah Bellows is a myth,

49:28.720 --> 49:30.837
and even if she's not, she's dead.

49:32.320 --> 49:34.551
- We need to go to the police.
- We can't.

49:34.680 --> 49:37.912
They know what Tommy did to Ramon's car,
and they think that he had...

49:38.000 --> 49:41.072
- Auggie! We need to find Auggie!
- I'm not going to the police.

49:42.200 --> 49:44.032
They'll never believe a word I say.

49:45.040 --> 49:46.599
Well, then we'll make them believe.

49:46.680 --> 49:49.275
By the time
that they make sense of everything,

49:49.360 --> 49:50.430
we're all gonna be dead.

49:50.520 --> 49:52.113
No, no, no.

49:52.200 --> 49:56.114
If we can't go to the police,
what do we do?

49:56.200 --> 49:58.510
Just sit and wait
for our story to be written?

50:00.000 --> 50:02.231
There's gotta be some way to stop a witch.

50:02.320 --> 50:03.959
Well, I don't believe any of it.

50:04.560 --> 50:05.676
I gotta go.

50:05.760 --> 50:06.955
My musical's tonight,

50:07.040 --> 50:09.874
and I'm not falling for another one
of your dumb Halloween pranks.

50:09.960 --> 50:11.440
It's not a prank, Ruth.

50:11.520 --> 50:13.296
- Ruth.
- I know you want to be a writer,

50:13.320 --> 50:16.916
- but this prank is sick.
- No! Ruthie! Ruthie, stop.

50:19.240 --> 50:20.880
<i>Do you think this is gonna work?</i>

50:22.120 --> 50:23.713
It worked in Salem.

50:46.040 --> 50:49.590
Why? Why won't you burn? I hate you!
I hate you! I hate you! Goddamn it!

50:49.680 --> 50:51.194
This is why I don't read books!

50:51.280 --> 50:53.040
We know we can't burn or destroy it,

50:53.080 --> 50:56.835
but how much do we actually know
about Sarah Bellows?

51:35.640 --> 51:36.915
Listen to this one.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.434
"After Sarah hung herself,

51:38.520 --> 51:41.957
the Bellows family fired Sylvie Baptiste

51:42.040 --> 51:44.839
as she and her daughter, Lou Lou,
were thought to be responsible

51:44.920 --> 51:46.752
for teaching her black magic."

51:47.400 --> 51:49.596
If it's in the paper,
it has to be true, right?

51:50.560 --> 51:52.358
Is there a picture of Sarah?

51:52.440 --> 51:54.352
No, just her name.

51:54.440 --> 51:57.319
But, uh, I did find an ad for brain salt.

51:57.400 --> 52:00.074
Cures headaches and constipation.

52:00.160 --> 52:01.799
Not sure why it didn't take off.

52:02.840 --> 52:04.832
Auggie. Auggie would have loved that.

52:08.520 --> 52:11.035
My eyes
are literally gonna start bleeding,

52:11.120 --> 52:12.918
and we still have nothing on Sarah.

52:13.920 --> 52:15.957
What year did she hang herself?

52:16.040 --> 52:17.474
Uh...

52:19.360 --> 52:20.430
1898.

52:22.040 --> 52:24.509
In just one year,
all her family members left.

52:24.600 --> 52:27.672
What do you expect? I mean,
who wants to stick around with the name

52:27.760 --> 52:29.638
that's synonymous with murdering kids?

52:29.720 --> 52:32.030
Not stick around. I mean gone.

52:32.120 --> 52:34.157
Like, off the face of the earth.

52:35.720 --> 52:38.599
Take the father, Deodat.

52:38.680 --> 52:43.072
The cat owned a paper mill, and yet
he leaves it without ever selling it?

52:43.160 --> 52:46.790
No stories written about him,
not even a letter, just disappears.

52:47.800 --> 52:51.111
Deodat...

52:52.040 --> 52:53.554
I've seen that name.

53:02.440 --> 53:05.877
"Deodat was a wealthy man
who wanted to go hunting."

53:07.920 --> 53:09.718
Give me another name.

53:09.800 --> 53:13.157
Uh... One of their sons, Ephraim.

53:13.240 --> 53:15.675
Ephraim Bellows.

53:19.560 --> 53:21.756
They didn't just leave the town.

53:23.560 --> 53:25.438
They each have a story.

53:26.040 --> 53:27.235
Why?

53:35.000 --> 53:37.515
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, it's happening again.

53:37.600 --> 53:39.000
She's writing another story.

53:41.720 --> 53:43.791
"The Red Spot"?

53:50.120 --> 53:52.874
Why are you looking at me?

53:53.000 --> 53:54.320
What?

53:56.680 --> 53:58.433
Oh, shit. Oh, shit, it's me?

53:58.520 --> 54:00.113
It... I'm gonna die?

54:00.200 --> 54:02.000
I don't wanna die.
I haven't even had sex yet.

54:02.080 --> 54:04.816
"One night, a spider crawled
across a young girl's cheek and bit her."

54:04.840 --> 54:07.196
Spider? I was the spider man! I'm...

54:07.280 --> 54:08.919
Wait, "young girl"?

54:10.960 --> 54:12.296
"...went to the restroom."

54:12.320 --> 54:14.357
It's not you. It's your sister.

54:14.480 --> 54:15.516
Ruthie?

54:26.000 --> 54:29.072
<i>Performers to stage in 20 minutes.</i>

54:44.240 --> 54:47.153
Oh, honey,
you need to do something about that.

54:48.960 --> 54:50.235
Yeah.

55:51.680 --> 55:52.875
It's a different bathroom.

55:54.920 --> 55:56.752
- Second floor.
- Okay.

56:03.120 --> 56:05.476
Ruth.

56:29.960 --> 56:31.474
Move. Out of the way.

56:58.000 --> 56:59.070
Ruth!

57:02.320 --> 57:03.436
Oh, my God, Ruth!

57:04.720 --> 57:06.712
Help me! Help me!

57:06.800 --> 57:09.759
Ruth, I got you.
It's okay. It's okay. I got you.

57:09.840 --> 57:11.752
Help me! Help me! Get them off!

57:11.840 --> 57:13.991
Get them off!

57:14.080 --> 57:16.993
- Ruth, it's okay. I got you.
- Get them off!

57:17.120 --> 57:19.120
You're gonna be okay, all right?
It's okay.

57:22.720 --> 57:24.313
Move, move, move!

57:28.080 --> 57:31.073
You're okay.
You're okay, you're okay, Ruthie.

57:31.160 --> 57:32.992
Help! Somebody, get help, now!

57:41.000 --> 57:42.275
You're okay, Ruthie.

57:42.360 --> 57:44.079
- You're gonna be okay.
- Get them off.

57:44.160 --> 57:45.958
They're all gone, Ruthie.
They're all gone.

57:46.040 --> 57:48.680
Get them off me. Get them off.
Get them off me. Get them off me!

57:48.760 --> 57:51.594
Ruthie, they're all gone.
They're all gone, okay?

57:51.680 --> 57:53.433
- Get them off me!
- You're okay.

57:54.960 --> 57:56.394
Get them off me!

58:04.000 --> 58:06.799
It was intense. I hope she's okay.

58:08.000 --> 58:10.117
I saw her. Sarah was there.

58:10.200 --> 58:12.715
She was controlling the entire thing.

58:12.840 --> 58:14.320
My sister's gone.

58:15.000 --> 58:16.116
We're next.

58:17.360 --> 58:18.794
We're next.

58:25.920 --> 58:27.070
You find it?

58:29.720 --> 58:31.313
Louise Baptiste...

58:32.440 --> 58:33.635
Lou Lou?

58:34.680 --> 58:36.160
220 Goldshire Road.

58:39.920 --> 58:41.991
I had this messed-up dream again.

58:42.120 --> 58:43.952
I was trapped in the red room.

58:44.080 --> 58:49.360
And there's that fat, pale lady
who keeps whispering:

58:49.440 --> 58:51.591
"This is an evil place.

58:51.680 --> 58:53.592
Run away while you still can."

58:56.600 --> 58:59.115
I'm scared the witch
is gonna use it against me.

59:04.080 --> 59:05.355
Hello.

59:05.440 --> 59:08.478
Does Lou Lou Baptiste live here still?

59:08.560 --> 59:13.191
<i>I don't want to bomb anybody
if it's not necessary to save...</i>

59:13.360 --> 59:16.319
Tricky Dicky.
That's no name for a president.

59:16.400 --> 59:18.756
Mama, you got company!

59:32.680 --> 59:34.478
Lou Lou, can you hear us?

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:21.876
You may be the next.

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:24.759
Why do you say that?

01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.596
Why, that's the song, girl.

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:34.876
<i>♪ Don't ever laugh
As a hearse goes by ♪</i>

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:39.193
<i>♪ For you may be
The next to die ♪</i>

01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:43.632
Sarah loved that song.

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:50.360
We have her book.

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:57.391
You found her book? Give it here.

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.159
I give her this.

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.997
I feel so sorry for that girl,

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:21.393
sitting down there in the darkness
all by herself.

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:26.991
Did your mom ever teach her anything?

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:29.630
Teach her?

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:31.520
Black magic?

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:35.280
No.

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:37.591
There is no magic, child.

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:41.032
There is only rage.

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:45.074
Then how is she still writing the stories?

01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:49.233
Stories hurt.

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:51.800
Stories heal.

01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:55.516
Do you know what you have done?

01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:57.034
Done what?

01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:59.351
You shouldn't have taken the book.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.479
You made her angry.

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:12.109
<i>♪ The worms crawl in
The worms crawl out ♪</i>

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:14.396
- She gets this way sometimes.
- Look, I need to know.

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:18.872
- Another time. I need to settle her down.
- No, we need to know. I need to know.

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:21.236
She told the doctors everything she knew
at the hospital

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:22.959
where that disturbed girl hung herself.

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:25.999
But I thought... Everyone always said
Sarah hanged herself in the house.

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:27.833
You weren't there. Mama was.

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:31.750
- The hospitals have records.
- Records of Sarah?

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:34.753
Then what are we still doing here?
Let's go.

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:41.035
<i>It's election day, folks,
so let your voice be heard.</i>

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:45.751
<i>Say no to the war. Say no to Vietnam.</i>

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:49.993
<i>Say no to sending our children to die.</i>

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:23.680
Excuse me.

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:28.757
We need to see the records
of a former patient.

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:31.672
We don't give out patient records.

01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:35.960
Well, uh...

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:37.594
I mean...

01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:40.673
she died about a hundred years ago.

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:45.911
I'm sure she or anybody else
probably doesn't care, you know.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.151
Why do you kids
wanna look at old patient files?

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:51.870
For a school assignment on, uh...

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:56.156
psychological human studies.

01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:58.234
Yes, the studies.

01:03:58.840 --> 01:03:59.840
Mm-hm.

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:04.638
I think they put the files
from the old hospital in the RED room.

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:06.910
Red room?

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:10.078
Six weeks' processing time.

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:11.395
At most.

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:13.516
Need a pen?

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:20.832
So much for that.

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:26.359
- Come on.
- No.

01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:47.553
- We are not going to the red room.
- No, we are going to the red room.

01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:48.994
- No, I'm not.
- Yes.

01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.878
No. I'm not doing it.

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:56.799
<i>Dr. Kaufmann
to telephone, please. Dr. Kaufmann.</i>

01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:00.669
I told you about my dream.
I don't want to go.

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:04.229
So it's not actually red. You're fine.

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:11.430
It is called the RED room, okay?
Who said it had to be red?

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:14.199
Uh-uh. Count me out.

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:16.795
Okay. Just stay here.

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:21.280
We'll be quick. It'll be fine.

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:24.594
Just don't get caught.

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:12.120
George Foreman. He's going to be
the world champion in '73.

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:13.919
Hey, you know where you're going?

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:21.519
Oh, God, Oh, God, oh, God.

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:25.437
Hey, you there.

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:27.000
You're not supposed to be here.

01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:28.594
Hey! Stop!

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:40.080
The RED room.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.391
Admittance records,
psychological exams, what she ate...

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:13.079
This is everything.

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:15.880
She was admitted by her own family.

01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:22.633
Says here that she was suffering
from achromasia-albinism.

01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:25.838
They put her in her basement
because she was different.

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:32.392
Here, her supervising doctor was...

01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:36.396
Dr. Ephraim Bellows.

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:38.153
Her own brother?

01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:39.280
Yeah.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.311
Jesus. They tortured her.

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:50.235
Look, electroshock, isolation therapy...

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:52.676
lateral cerebral diathermia treatment.

01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:56.560
What about this thing?

01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:03.756
What is this?

01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:08.679
I've seen one of these before.

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:11.354
It's a wax cylinder.

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:18.879
They used them
to make recordings before LPs.

01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:25.470
So does that mean
we're gonna get to hear Sarah?

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:36.312
He went this way. Sound the alarm!

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:44.679
<i>You're going to tell the truth now.</i>

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:46.194
<i>Aren't you, Sarah?</i>

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:55.670
<i>I didn't hurt the children.</i>

01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:59.433
<i>I didn't.</i>

01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:06.960
<i>- Ephraim...
- That isn't the truth, is it?</i>

01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:10.868
<i>I didn't do it. I didn't hurt...</i>

01:09:15.319 --> 01:09:18.916
- <i>Tell the truth, Sarah.
- I'm your sister...</i>

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:23.233
- <i>You poisoned those children.
- No. No.</i>

01:09:23.319 --> 01:09:25.551
<i>I tried...</i>

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:27.671
<i>I tried to save them.</i>

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:32.877
<i>But nobody listened.</i>

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:35.191
<i>I didn't want them hurt,</i>

01:09:35.279 --> 01:09:38.751
<i>- ...but you wouldn't let me out.
- Sarah...</i>

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:46.595
<i>Tell the truth.</i>

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:48.911
She doesn't know what she did.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.399
<i>It was the water.</i>

01:09:50.479 --> 01:09:52.198
<i>We went over this, Sarah.</i>

01:09:52.279 --> 01:09:53.760
<i>The water...</i>

01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:57.629
<i>There's nothing wrong with the water.</i>

01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:00.554
<i>- That's why you're here.
- The mill...</i>

01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:04.998
<i>It was the mercury from the mill.
You poisoned the wa...</i>

01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:09.430
She didn't do it.

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:11.160
It was her family.

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:15.716
<i>Sarah...</i>

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:18.280
<i>are you still here?</i>

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:23.639
<i>I'll tell you.</i>

01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:27.231
<i>I'll tell you what you want to hear.</i>

01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:30.510
<i>And what's that?</i>

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:42.275
<i>Charlie had a dream of a red room...</i>

01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:46.397
- <i>Charlie?</i>
- The RED room.

01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:48.597
<i>Charlie who?</i>

01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:50.473
Chuck.

01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:51.750
<i>In his dream...</i>

01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:56.517
<i>a woman with a pale face,</i>

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:58.831
<i>black eyes</i>

01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:01.480
<i>and long black hair</i>

01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:04.394
<i>slipped silently into his room.</i>

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:08.837
<i>She leaned over and whispered:</i>

01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:13.153
<i>"This is an evil place.</i>

01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:17.154
<i>Run away while you still can."</i>

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:33.430
That's not good.

01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:34.670
Chuck!

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:45.755
Help!

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:50.399
Help! Somebody help!

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:39.791
Help! Please, somebody help!

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:20.560
Help! Help! Somebody help!

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:22.635
Come on.

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:18.316
Chuck! Chuck, where are you?

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:19.675
Chuck!

01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:23.636
- Where is he?
- He should be right here.

01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:25.518
Chuck? Chuck?

01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:29.600
Chuck.

01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:44.673
So where's your little friend?

01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:50.198
<i>News coverage

01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:12.712
Told you everything we know.

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:17.352
Heh. Oh, yeah, right. Sarah Bellows' book.

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:22.834
The stories write themselves,
and it all comes alive.

01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:25.310
We can't find any bodies.

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:26.516
Yeah, I know.

01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:29.154
It's hard to believe.

01:17:30.360 --> 01:17:32.431
We saved Ruth at school.

01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:34.352
I mean,
we stopped her from getting killed.

01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:38.192
Ruth Steinberg?

01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:39.919
That's who you're talking about?

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.195
You didn't save anyone.

01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:45.193
She's stuck in the nuthouse
for the rest of her life.

01:17:46.480 --> 01:17:49.314
Get out of here, Stella.
You're free to go.

01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:51.960
You're so much better
than this draft dodger.

01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:55.152
Come on, what would your father say?

01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:58.076
I'm not leaving.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.400
Since you're not going to 'Nam,

01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:05.837
maybe a night behind bars
will loosen those lips of yours.

01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:08.830
Come on, Hobbs.

01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:14.593
Go home, dig out that 10 bucks
you're gonna owe me when Nixon wins,

01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:16.478
and I'll close up here.

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:19.160
- All right, have a good night.
- Nighty-night, lovebirds.

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:21.594
I should've told you.

01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:26.192
- You must think I'm a coward, but...
- I would never think that.

01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:37.992
Two months ago, they shipped
my brother back from Vietnam...

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:40.510
in pieces.

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:43.438
I'm so sorry.

01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:48.750
Last week when I got my draft notice...

01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:53.118
I couldn't.

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:55.032
They just send you there to die.

01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:58.039
If the book reads me...

01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:01.392
I'm afraid what it's gonna say.

01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:31.758
There you go, boy. Yeah, that's good, huh?

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:42.835
"Me Tie Dough-ty Walker"?

01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:56.200
Who came up with all this sick stuff?

01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:59.114
Is this you, Stella?

01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:02.437
We didn't write the stories.

01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:41.029
Trigger?

01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:45.434
Wait, is there another story?

01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:48.119
Please, you have to let us out.

01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:51.272
If there's another story,
we are all gonna be in danger.

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:55.279
Tell us what's happening!

01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:56.794
What's the story?

01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:05.231
Please just listen to me, okay?
We're all gonna die.

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:21.793
It's my turn.

01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:24.634
Okay, what happens in the story?

01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:27.997
Just tell me which name is in the book.

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:29.400
Ramon.

01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:43.437
It's a campfire story.
It used to scare me to death.

01:21:48.841 --> 01:21:50.638
The Jangly Man is coming.

01:21:50.720 --> 01:21:52.837
- He's gonna say "me"...
- What's going on?

01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:54.593
He's gonna say it. Listen.

01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:06.040
Me tie dough-ty walker!

01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:07.679
Are you shitting me?

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:30.877
Please, just let us out, please!

01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:08.234
Me tie dough-ty walker!

01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:26.719
Ramon.

01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:33.070
- Ramon.
- Oh, my God, Ramon.

01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:34.355
Oh, my God, what is that?

01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:40.713
Help! Help, please! Can someone hear me?

01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:47.835
Keys.

01:23:47.960 --> 01:23:49.633
Hurry!

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.116
Coward!

01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:11.720
I got the keys.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.878
Come on, come on, come on.

01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:19.716
Coward!

01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:23.713
Run. Go, go, go.

01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:41.076
What are you waiting for?

01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:42.674
Go to the house.

01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:44.035
Tell her the truth.

01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:45.440
That thing will follow me.

01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:49.673
- But the stories come true every time.
- Then you better run fast.

01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:51.592
Stop her and you'll stop this.

01:26:36.240 --> 01:26:39.836
Sarah! Can you hear me?

01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:42.913
Goddamn you!
You have to stop telling these stories!

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.037
We didn't do anything to you.

01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:47.760
We just want to help you.
We know you're innocent.

01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:49.718
We know you didn't poison the kids.

01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:53.191
But, please,
you just have to stop telling the stories.

01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:50.833
Stella! Where are you?

01:27:57.360 --> 01:27:58.360
No, no, no.

01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:00.520
Stella.

01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:09.832
Stella!

01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:23.193
- Hey, Stella!
- Ramon!

01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:28.960
She's out of her room again.

01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:31.794
Boys? Sarah's out!

01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:33.439
Find her now!

01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:35.675
Sarah!

01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:45.314
Sarah!

01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:49.837
You leave that to me, Harold.

01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:55.279
Sarah!

01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:58.599
Sarah, where are you?

01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:07.759
Sarah!

01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:22.513
I hear her.

01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:32.434
She's here!

01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:36.033
She's in here!

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:56.070
Sarah!

01:29:58.400 --> 01:29:59.550
Where are you?

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.400
Lou Lou.

01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:27.056
- Did you see Sarah?
- No, ma'am.

01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:31.518
- She's lying.
- You wouldn't lie, Lou Lou?

01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:33.796
No, ma'am. No, I didn't see Sarah.

01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:37.669
No, Mr. Bellows, please, no! Please, no!

01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:09.190
You can't hide from us.

01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:11.799
- Got you!
- No! No!

01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:15.591
Help me! Help me!

01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:17.717
- Help me!
- Stella!

01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:20.315
Please! Help me!

01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:22.357
She's telling everyone about the water.

01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:24.033
What should we do with her?

01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:26.656
You're gonna shut your ugly mouth
or we're gonna shut it for you.

01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:28.114
Please, help me!

01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:29.200
Help me, please!

01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:39.517
- Going back where you belong.
- Help me, please!

01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:41.876
Be quiet or you know what you'll get.

01:31:43.200 --> 01:31:45.999
Please. I'm not Sarah. Please!

01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:48.879
Please let me go! Please...

01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:50.633
Let me go!

01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:52.795
Please don't put me in here.

01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:55.270
Try this again
and we'll send you to the asylum.

01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:57.920
Please. Wait! Please?

01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.832
You should have stayed in your room.

01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:02.515
Please. Please. Please.

01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:05.320
- I didn't do it.
- You don't deserve the light.

01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:06.993
No!

01:32:08.360 --> 01:32:12.639
I'm telling you,
I'm telling you, I'm not Sarah.

01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:15.156
Please.

01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:26.237
Stella...

01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:43.270
I have another story...

01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:45.113
just for you.

01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:52.800
Stella...

01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:58.640
if you can hear me, wherever you are...

01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:00.791
tell her the truth.

01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:07.990
No.

01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:12.840
It's time that you hear a story, Sarah.

01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:18.679
You were a victim.

01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:22.630
Now you've turned into a monster.

01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:26.556
The one that they said you were.

01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:36.560
Stella.

01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:39.992
You took my friends.

01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:43.717
Two of the people that I love most.

01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:54.114
Ramon!

01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:56.910
Stella!

01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:00.392
Are you gonna take him too?

01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:03.876
What your family did to you...

01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:06.156
what they said, that's on them.

01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:09.713
But what you do...

01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:13.878
this is on you, Sarah.

01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:18.635
It's all on you.

01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:28.678
I'll tell your story.

01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:33.550
The real story. I'll tell the truth.

01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:39.157
But the rage...

01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:41.960
the rage has to stop, Sarah.

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:04.639
Use your blood.

01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:30.319
Sarah Bellows was innocent.

01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:33.757
She knew the truth...

01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:36.719
and tried to stop them. She was brave.

01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:42.749
She was harmed and destroyed
by her own family.

01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:47.357
By their greed and their lies

01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:49.318
and their sins.

01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:53.399
I'll tell your story.

01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:00.398
You can let it go.

01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:03.959
You can let it go, Sarah.

01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:51.277
<i>Stories hurt.</i>

01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:52.714
<i>Stories heal.</i>

01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:59.918
<i>If we repeat them often enough,
they become real.</i>

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:02.673
<i>They have that power.</i>

01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:07.794
<i>They make us who we are.</i>

01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:10.998
- Stella...
- I'm just so happy you're okay.

01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:26.513
<i>And if there's anything
I learned from Sarah...</i>

01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:30.198
<i>it's to never give up.</i>

01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:36.197
<i>I told Sarah's story
exactly as I promised.</i>

01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:40.394
<i>I wrote about the pale, lonely girl</i>

01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:42.631
<i>who wrote stories in the dark.</i>

01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:47.271
<i>And how she was turned into a monster
by her family.</i>

01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:53.836
<i>Some people believed me. Most didn't.</i>

01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:57.516
<i>Because, like Sarah, I was a lonely girl</i>

01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:00.240
<i>who knew how to tell a good creepy story.</i>

01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:08.156
Write me?

01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:21.794
Every day.

01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:24.675
See you around.

01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:31.754
- What's your name, kid?
- Ramon Morales.

01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:38.509
<i>Stories can teach us to care.</i>

01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:45.151
<i>They make us brave enough
to admit that we need each other...</i>

01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:49.119
<i>give us a home to go back to.</i>

01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:05.400
<i>Chuck and Auggie are still gone,</i>

01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:08.752
<i>but I know there is a way
to bring them back</i>

01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:10.797
<i>and that the secret is in the book.</i>

01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:14.431
<i>And we won't stop...</i>

01:40:16.360 --> 01:40:17.874
