Yeah?

02:22.660 --> 02:25.423
What the fuck do you care?

02:25.495 --> 02:28.430
Yeah, we won by seven, but it should've been twenty.

02:28.498 --> 02:30.932
Where were you?

02:31.000 --> 02:33.969

02:56.090 --> 02:58.887
You played right into
my game, Professor.

02:58.959 --> 03:01.018
<i>Next week?</i>

03:02.262 --> 03:04.696
<i> Ja, ja, ja. </i>

03:35.058 --> 03:36.992
<i>Even as a little kid... </i>

03:37.060 --> 03:40.518
<i>I was always one to examine things closely. </i>

03:40.597 --> 03:43.531
<i>The world was full of riddles and mysteries and puzzles,</i>

03:43.599 --> 03:47.228
<i>and I learned early on that I had a gift for solving them. </i>

03:47.303 --> 03:51.603
<i>I learned that careful examination of how and what and why... </i>

03:51.674 --> 03:55.871
<i>would inevitably lead to understanding, even to control. </i>

03:55.944 --> 03:59.141
<i>But what I didn't know, what I never could've imagined,</i>

03:59.214 --> 04:03.082
<i>was that one day my own life would
become the most challenging puzzle of all. </i>

04:03.151 --> 04:06.586
Hey, what's an eight-letter word for "slaughterhouse"?

04:10.925 --> 04:13.587
- Abattoir.
- You're good.

04:13.661 --> 04:16.891
How do you spell your last name again?

04:16.963 --> 04:20.262
"N-E-N-O-N-E-N."
Tony Nenonen.

04:20.333 --> 04:23.530
What's it been now nine months, Detective?

04:23.603 --> 04:26.537
- What's a ten-letter word for your name?
- For my name?

04:28.607 --> 04:30.541
My name's got seven letters.

04:30.609 --> 04:33.544
Yeah, but it's a ten-letter word.

04:33.612 --> 04:35.546
Ten-letter word?

04:56.066 --> 04:58.330
What the hell is this?

05:13.815 --> 05:16.943
Here's what he looks like with a face.

05:18.720 --> 05:20.654
" Jay Cho. "

05:21.856 --> 05:23.846
We went to high school together.

05:32.799 --> 05:35.494
So you knew this guy, huh?

05:35.568 --> 05:37.502
Was he a friend of yours?

05:38.738 --> 05:40.672
No.

05:44.909 --> 05:47.377
He was real odd.

05:47.445 --> 05:49.379
Was kinda quiet.

05:49.447 --> 05:52.473
Didn't really seem to have any friends.

05:52.550 --> 05:55.713
One year he tried out for the basketball team.

05:55.787 --> 05:58.653
<i>What a nightmare. </i>

05:58.722 --> 06:02.158
We tortured the shit out of him until he quit.

06:02.226 --> 06:04.456
What'd you do to him?

06:04.528 --> 06:07.360
We gave him hell.

06:11.167 --> 06:15.126
Yeah, one time I saw this guy that had been attacked by a grizzly bear.

06:15.204 --> 06:17.138
Sort of looked like this.

06:17.206 --> 06:19.139
<i>Somethin'had just ripped him apart. </i>

06:20.976 --> 06:22.910
You ever go fishing, Tony?

06:26.481 --> 06:29.916
<i>Sometimes I take the boys up to the mountains. </i>

07:35.311 --> 07:37.471
<i>What do you got?</i>

07:39.948 --> 07:42.143
It's a child's finger.

08:04.837 --> 08:07.271
We got two good prints off the box.

08:07.340 --> 08:08.471
One belongs to your victim.

08:08.497 --> 08:10.800
I'll run the other one through the computer tomorrow.

08:10.842 --> 08:12.776
- Can't you run 'em tonight?
- No.

08:12.844 --> 08:15.779
'Cause, believe it or not, I also have a life.

09:31.349 --> 09:34.284
- Feeling any better?
- A little.

09:34.352 --> 09:36.286
I took a bath.

09:36.354 --> 09:38.288
And a pill.

09:40.657 --> 09:43.023
Are you home for the night?

09:43.093 --> 09:46.028
Actually, I, uh, caught a case.

09:47.798 --> 09:49.732
How was your game?

09:49.800 --> 09:51.733
We won.

09:52.969 --> 09:53.735
Get some sleep.

09:53.761 --> 09:55.292
You'll feel better tomorrow.

10:04.079 --> 10:06.445
<i>I believe in loyalty,</i>

10:06.514 --> 10:08.448
<i>fidelity. </i>

10:08.516 --> 10:09.987
<i>I understand the concept.</i>

10:10.013 --> 10:12.602
<i>My parents have been married for 40 years. </i>

10:12.654 --> 10:15.554
<i>But I live in a different world. </i>

10:17.157 --> 10:19.352
<i>Most marriages fail. </i>

10:19.426 --> 10:21.621
<i>Most men just leave. </i>

10:21.695 --> 10:24.858
<i>I know that would kill her. </i>

10:24.932 --> 10:28.867
<i>But if she doesn't know, if doing this keeps me coming back,</i>

10:28.935 --> 10:32.598
<i>then who's to say what's right and what's wrong?</i>

10:38.043 --> 10:40.568
<i>Oh, God, these boots hurt. </i>

10:46.585 --> 10:48.745
<i>A detective. </i>

10:49.887 --> 10:52.947
I like cops.

10:55.326 --> 10:56.918
You got any gum?

11:54.913 --> 11:57.507
I'll do whatever you want,

11:57.582 --> 12:00.517
as many times as you want it.

12:03.722 --> 12:06.815
<i> ц Livin'in the best of all possible worlds ц</i>

12:06.890 --> 12:17.599
<i> ц We're livin'in the best of all possible worlds ц</i>

12:41.922 --> 12:45.414
<i> ц Livin' ц</i>

12:45.493 --> 12:49.623
<i> ц You know we're livin' ц</i>

14:49.706 --> 14:52.470
Am I dreaming?

14:57.446 --> 14:59.880
<i>Help me!</i>

17:56.175 --> 17:57.164
<i>Morning, Detective. </i>

17:58.277 --> 18:01.440
<i>You look like you could use an autopsy yourself. </i>

18:01.514 --> 18:03.379
You were right
about Jay Cho.

18:03.449 --> 18:09.148
The punctures and tears in the flesh were
made by a hook, or hooks, with barbed ends.

18:09.220 --> 18:11.654
But they weren't like piercings for jewelry.

18:11.723 --> 18:15.659
There was something bigger, more cutting, like...

18:15.727 --> 18:18.661
- Like maybe it was supposed to hurt?
- Bingo.

18:18.729 --> 18:21.664
- What about the child's finger in the candle?
- Oh, that.

18:21.732 --> 18:24.166
Well, the print was burned off completely,

18:24.234 --> 18:28.693
but from the bone growth I'd say the kid was about six or seven years old.

18:28.771 --> 18:30.705
Was it a boy or a girl?

18:30.773 --> 18:34.209
At that age, without D.N.A. Results, you really can't tell.

18:34.277 --> 18:36.575
<i>One more thing. </i>

18:36.646 --> 18:39.978
From the blood flow and tissue morbidity,
I'm pretty sure when the finger was cut off...

18:40.048 --> 18:42.573
that kid was still alive.

18:50.591 --> 18:52.582
<i> Joe. Joe!</i>

18:52.660 --> 18:55.321
Talk to me. Are you listening to me?

18:55.347 --> 18:56.712
What's the answer?

18:56.764 --> 18:58.698
Ten-letter word for my name.

19:00.601 --> 19:02.463
You're giving up quicker than usual, Tony.

19:02.489 --> 19:03.788
Tell me the goddamn word.

19:04.904 --> 19:06.838
Palindrome.

19:06.906 --> 19:09.067
Your name's a palindrome.

19:09.142 --> 19:11.426
Palindrome? What's that, huh?

19:11.452 --> 19:13.262
You makin' fun of me?

19:13.312 --> 19:15.439
Is that somethin' bad?

19:15.514 --> 19:17.448
N- E-N-O-N-E-N.

19:18.550 --> 19:21.542
Spelled the same way forwards and back.

19:21.620 --> 19:23.674
It's like the phrase, " Madam in Eden, I'm Adam.

19:23.700 --> 19:24.579
" It's a palindrome.

19:24.622 --> 19:28.058
- Ends the same way it begins.
- I get it.

19:28.126 --> 19:30.002
It's like the name Bob.

19:30.028 --> 19:31.985
That's one too, right?

19:34.298 --> 19:37.391
Yeah.
That's good, Tony.

19:40.504 --> 19:42.233
Detective Thorne.

19:42.305 --> 19:45.967
<i>Hey, Joe. It's Daphne. </i>

19:46.041 --> 19:47.975
I'm the girl you were with last night.

19:48.043 --> 19:50.978
- This is my direct line. How did you...
- Please!

19:51.046 --> 19:52.980
I'm still at the motel.

19:53.048 --> 19:54.982
Oh, my God.

19:55.050 --> 19:56.768
Oh, God! Please help me!

19:56.794 --> 19:58.009
Please help me!

19:58.052 --> 19:59.073
Okay, listen, wait.

19:59.099 --> 20:00.011
Just slow down.

21:24.565 --> 21:28.056
This is un-fucking-believable.

21:28.134 --> 21:30.068
What happened?

21:32.472 --> 21:34.963
I stayed here last night and...

21:35.041 --> 21:37.975
You and Melanie have a fight again?

21:39.545 --> 21:42.378
It's much worse than that.

21:45.718 --> 21:47.743
Check out the bathroom.

22:20.082 --> 22:23.016
What the fuck do you mean, you stayed here last night?

22:23.084 --> 22:25.018
- Tony...
- Jesus Christ!

22:26.821 --> 22:30.257
What the fuck did you do?

22:35.296 --> 22:37.730
I was with that girl last night.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.935
I did coke with her and I had sex with her,

22:43.003 --> 22:45.937
but I have no fucking idea who did that to her.

22:46.005 --> 22:51.409
<i>When I left this morning she was right
on this bed sleeping like a baby. </i>

22:51.477 --> 22:53.604
<i>Look, Tony, you gotta help me. </i>

22:53.680 --> 22:55.614
<i>If I get connected with this thing,</i>

22:55.682 --> 22:57.615
everything I have...

22:57.683 --> 23:00.550
my family, ten years on the job... gone.

23:00.619 --> 23:01.625
Aw, shit, man.

23:01.651 --> 23:03.710
Don't do this to me, Joseph.

23:03.736 --> 23:04.740
You know me.

23:04.790 --> 23:05.716
<i>I'm a good cop.</i>

23:05.742 --> 23:08.147
<i>I play things straight down the line. </i>

23:08.192 --> 23:10.285
<i> Jesus!</i>

23:10.361 --> 23:13.489
I got a wife and two kids of my own.

23:13.564 --> 23:16.624
I know you do, Tony, and you are a good cop.

23:16.701 --> 23:19.294
But you're also my partner.

23:19.369 --> 23:21.394
<i>Look at me, Tony. </i>

23:21.471 --> 23:23.735
Look in my eyes.

23:23.807 --> 23:26.139
You tell me I'm lyin'.

23:37.152 --> 23:38.191
<i>Well, that's it. </i>

23:38.217 --> 23:40.112
<i>That's everything I touched. </i>

23:42.690 --> 23:44.624
Phone it in.

23:54.601 --> 23:56.626
<i>It's Nenonen. </i>

23:56.703 --> 23:58.637
<i>We got a homicide. </i>

23:58.705 --> 24:02.163
<i>Sunrise Motel, 39th and Rose. </i>

24:02.242 --> 24:03.868
Yeah, white female, 20s.

24:03.943 --> 24:07.504
<i>Somebody hung her in the shower like a piece of meat. </i>

24:08.981 --> 24:11.415
I don't know, you'll

24:11.484 --> 24:13.418
<i>have to ask Detective Thorne. </i>

24:15.787 --> 24:18.221
<i>Think it was an anonymous tip. </i>

24:45.415 --> 24:47.349
Let's get the fuck outta here.

24:49.584 --> 24:52.018
Is that what I think it is?

24:52.087 --> 24:54.351
<i>Yeah. </i>
<i>It's another one. </i>

24:59.327 --> 25:01.385
<i>No stiffness. </i>

25:01.462 --> 25:03.487
This child was still alive.

25:07.268 --> 25:09.202
We gotta find this kid.

25:20.780 --> 25:23.714
You get a match on the print from that box?

25:23.782 --> 25:27.047
No, Detective, but I'm running the print from the box right now.

25:27.119 --> 25:29.679
When did you start?

25:29.755 --> 25:34.088
Two hours ago. A.F.I.S. Goes through 50,000 print cards in an hour.

25:34.158 --> 25:37.067
<i>We got seven million print cards in the system.</i>

25:37.093 --> 25:37.880
<i>Do the math. </i>

25:37.929 --> 25:39.401
- <i> Change the parameters. </i>

25:39.427 --> 25:40.445
- <i>Based on what?</i>

25:40.498 --> 25:41.920
It's a non-suspect ident.

25:41.946 --> 25:44.959
I already limited it to a history of violent crime.

25:45.001 --> 25:47.970
Come on, Detective, let's not waste my time.

25:53.510 --> 25:55.974
Your time is not important right now.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.231
You understand me?

25:58.581 --> 26:00.947
What do you want me to do?

26:02.284 --> 26:04.844
Take out the violent crime parameter.

26:04.920 --> 26:07.046
Leave criminal history wide open.

26:07.122 --> 26:08.940
<i>Go under distinguishing marks.</i>

26:08.966 --> 26:10.844
<i>Select for body alteration. </i>

26:12.360 --> 26:14.794
- What, like tattoos?
- No.

26:14.863 --> 26:16.757
Something with hooks.

26:16.783 --> 26:18.584
Try body piercing.

26:42.154 --> 26:45.351
Sherlock fucking Holmes.

26:46.458 --> 26:49.120
Print the file.

27:05.575 --> 27:07.573
It's the last
door on the left.

27:07.599 --> 27:08.535
Thank you.

27:15.417 --> 27:17.351
Another happy customer?

27:17.419 --> 27:19.722
So she won't be giving head for a while.

27:19.748 --> 27:21.039
What can I do you for?

27:21.089 --> 27:23.023
Let's talk about the box.

27:23.091 --> 27:25.025
What box?

27:25.093 --> 27:28.027
Little gold box about four inches square.

27:28.095 --> 27:30.123
Jay Cho told me I could find it here.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.055
He did, huh?

27:31.098 --> 27:33.032
Jay Cho.

27:34.435 --> 27:36.699
You tell Jay Cho something for me.

27:36.770 --> 27:40.206
You tell him the Engineer wants his money or he wants his property back.

27:40.273 --> 27:43.709
You tell Jay Cho the next time I see him I'm gonna rip his head off.

27:43.777 --> 27:47.213
And he'd still be better off dealing with me than with the Engineer.

27:47.280 --> 27:48.648
Take it easy, pal.

27:48.674 --> 27:49.738
I'm not Jay.

27:49.782 --> 27:53.047
"Take it easy. "
Who the fuck are you?

27:53.118 --> 27:55.052
I'm that guy.

27:59.724 --> 28:02.249
Why don't you tell me about the Engineer, Leon.

28:05.296 --> 28:07.230
- Leon?
- No way.

28:09.300 --> 28:11.324
Leon, you just got off parole.

28:11.401 --> 28:13.392
<i>And Jay Cho is dead. </i>

28:13.470 --> 28:18.271
His body was ripped apart by hooks that
were big enough to snag a great white.

28:18.342 --> 28:19.228
Guess what.

28:19.254 --> 28:22.234
Your fingerprints were on that box.

28:22.278 --> 28:23.228
He wanted it.

28:23.254 --> 28:25.739
Jay Cho wanted that goddamn box.

28:25.781 --> 28:27.715
He tried to buy it,

28:27.783 --> 28:30.718
and when he couldn't afford it the motherfucker stole it off of me.

28:30.786 --> 28:32.165
- He couldn't afford it?

28:32.191 --> 28:34.143
Jay Cho had money.
- Not enough.

28:34.189 --> 28:35.436
Why is the box so expensive?

28:35.462 --> 28:36.307
I don't know.

28:36.358 --> 28:37.712
Why did Jay want it so bad?

28:37.738 --> 28:38.953
I'm just a middle man.

28:38.979 --> 28:40.469
I was just taking offers.

28:40.495 --> 28:41.989
Holding it for the Engineer?

28:42.015 --> 28:43.455
The box is his, isn't it?

28:43.498 --> 28:47.456
Look, man, you can arrest me,

28:47.534 --> 28:51.766
you can take me downtown, beat the shit
out of me, do whatever the fuck you want,

28:51.839 --> 28:55.797
but there is no way I'm gonna talk to you about the Engineer.

28:55.875 --> 28:57.638
That's okay, Leon.

28:57.710 --> 29:00.645
I'll find him, whether you talk to me or not.

29:02.215 --> 29:04.149
Hunt for the Engineer...

29:05.151 --> 29:07.243
and the Engineer will hunt you.

29:10.322 --> 29:15.589
If you lost this guy's box, you may be in a world of shit yourself.

29:15.661 --> 29:18.254
Don't forget about me, huh?

29:18.329 --> 29:21.264
Yeah, I'll send you some candy at Christmas.

29:35.979 --> 29:38.209
What?

29:40.249 --> 29:43.184
So, are you gonna frisk me or fuck me?

29:55.330 --> 29:57.992
ц Cold and sweet's the only way ц

29:58.066 --> 30:02.332
ц To beat the heat on a hot summer's day ц

30:02.403 --> 30:03.905
<i>Yeah! All right, man.</i>

30:03.931 --> 30:05.362
<i>You be cool now. </i>

30:05.405 --> 30:07.339
There's my man.

30:07.407 --> 30:09.109
Hey, hey, hey, man!

30:09.135 --> 30:10.299
How are ya?

30:10.344 --> 30:13.279
What'd you hook 'em up with, Bernie?

30:13.347 --> 30:14.522
Please. I got scruples.

30:14.548 --> 30:17.205
With the young 'uns I only deal in the double dip.

30:17.249 --> 30:20.013
<i>Ah, keep that thing open, Bernie. </i>

30:20.086 --> 30:22.646
I want my birthday present.

30:24.023 --> 30:27.617
Sure got a lot of fuckin' birthdays.

30:27.692 --> 30:29.626
That's right.

30:31.429 --> 30:35.388
So, you, uh, you ever heard of a hooker named Daphne?

30:35.467 --> 30:37.400
What'd she look like?

30:37.468 --> 30:39.868
She's got dark hair, hot little body.

30:39.937 --> 30:42.872
Works the stroll south of the boulevard.

30:42.940 --> 30:44.874
How young?

30:44.942 --> 30:45.988
She's over 18.

30:46.014 --> 30:48.402
Probably a little old for you.

30:48.444 --> 30:51.379
Daphne, Cory, Shauna, Dewanna.

30:51.447 --> 30:53.915
They all kinda blur together, you know.

30:53.983 --> 30:57.419
<i>But yeah, I think I know who you mean. </i>

30:57.487 --> 30:58.604
She's kinda new.

30:58.630 --> 31:00.446
Can't say I've partaken.

31:00.489 --> 31:02.354
Who did she work for?

31:02.424 --> 31:03.572
<i>Oh, come on, man. </i>

31:03.598 --> 31:05.384
<i>I'm out of that business. </i>

31:05.427 --> 31:07.361
<i>Okay, fine. </i>

31:07.429 --> 31:11.694
Maybe I know that she works for this, um, this guy, Terry somebody.

31:11.766 --> 31:12.740
Connected guy.

31:12.766 --> 31:14.225
Got a lot going on.

31:14.268 --> 31:16.202
Connected how?

31:16.270 --> 31:18.204
<i>He's a connected guy. </i>

31:20.274 --> 31:22.537
Does he work for the Engineer?

31:22.609 --> 31:26.375
Huh?
I don't know no Engineer.

31:28.948 --> 31:32.212
- Bernie.
- I don't know no Engineer.

31:32.284 --> 31:36.277
What the hell, man!

31:38.390 --> 31:39.077
Stop it!

31:39.103 --> 31:41.851
Joe, why are you treating me like this?

31:41.894 --> 31:44.418
What am I, your whipping boy?

31:46.497 --> 31:48.431
You wanna go downtown, Bernie? Huh?

31:48.499 --> 31:50.933
Impound you van, explain your daily activities?

31:51.002 --> 31:52.700
You remember the last time.

31:52.726 --> 31:54.485
Okay, I... Shit! Okay.

31:59.643 --> 32:02.087
I want the Engineer, Bernie.

32:02.113 --> 32:03.160
Who is he?

32:03.213 --> 32:04.259
I never met him.

32:04.285 --> 32:05.305
I swear to God.

32:05.331 --> 32:06.832
I just heard stories.

32:08.184 --> 32:10.152
<i>This guy Terry,</i>

32:10.219 --> 32:13.484
he used to run women for the Engineer.

32:13.556 --> 32:17.924
A few years back the Engineer sends Terry this new girl.

32:17.992 --> 32:20.859
<i>Terry</i>...
<i>poor bastard</i>...

32:20.929 --> 32:24.330
pulls up his pants one day and finds out he's in love.

32:24.399 --> 32:26.924
<i>Well, they decide they're gonna get married. </i>

32:27.001 --> 32:29.434
But the Engineer said no.

32:31.405 --> 32:33.339
So Terry just takes her away.

32:33.407 --> 32:34.720
I mean, they elope.

32:34.746 --> 32:38.131
They go hide out in this cabin up in the hills.

32:38.178 --> 32:41.305
<i>They were gonna start this whole new fucking life together. </i>

32:41.380 --> 32:43.712
Then one day...

32:43.783 --> 32:46.217
Terry came home and...

32:46.285 --> 32:48.310
She was just gone.

32:51.289 --> 32:53.223
Terry went crazy.

32:53.291 --> 32:55.851
He put the word out on the street.

32:55.927 --> 32:58.953
<i>He said, "I'm gonna find the Engineer
and take back what's mine. "</i>

32:59.030 --> 33:02.795
Hunt for the Engineer and the Engineer hunts you.

33:02.867 --> 33:04.960
What did you say?

33:06.337 --> 33:09.204
Nothing.
It's just this...

33:09.273 --> 33:12.003
When people...

33:12.076 --> 33:14.009
hunt for the Engineer,

33:14.077 --> 33:16.011
they say...

33:16.079 --> 33:18.013
then the Engineer will hunt you.

33:23.753 --> 33:25.686
So then what happened?

33:26.889 --> 33:29.323
<i>Terry kept looking,</i>

33:29.391 --> 33:33.987
<i>but he never found the Engineer and to this
day he's never seen the Engineer again. </i>

33:34.062 --> 33:35.995
<i>But... </i>

33:36.063 --> 33:38.497
<i>Terry started getting these gifts,</i>

33:38.566 --> 33:41.831
<i>like the Engineer was sending him a message. </i>

33:41.903 --> 33:44.838
<i>A box would show up on his doorstep,</i>

33:44.906 --> 33:46.778
<i>or something would come in the mail...</i>

33:46.804 --> 33:48.195
<i>a locket that she once wore,</i>

33:48.241 --> 33:51.301
<i>or a clump of her hair. </i>

33:51.378 --> 33:53.312
<i>When her wedding ring arrived,</i>

33:53.380 --> 33:55.314
<i>Terry figured that she was dead. </i>

33:55.382 --> 33:57.942
<i>But he kept looking. </i>

33:58.017 --> 34:01.077
<i>And then just as it happened when she disappeared,</i>

34:01.153 --> 34:04.020
<i>Terry came home one morning and she was back again,</i>

34:04.089 --> 34:07.024
<i>just laying there in his bed, sleeping like a little baby. </i>

34:09.360 --> 34:12.295
<i>He tiptoed over to the bed... </i>

34:12.362 --> 34:15.297
<i>so he could slide in next to her. </i>

34:17.135 --> 34:19.295
<i>He pulled back the covers,</i>

34:20.603 --> 34:22.538
<i>but she wasn't there. </i>

34:23.774 --> 34:26.208
<i>What do you mean, she wasn't</i>...

34:27.444 --> 34:30.379
<i> Just a note where her body should have been. </i>

34:32.014 --> 34:33.606
<i>It said:</i>

34:35.717 --> 34:37.811
"You win, Terry.

34:37.887 --> 34:39.447
I kept what I needed.

34:39.474 --> 34:41.109
The rest is yours. "

34:46.194 --> 34:47.752
You believe that story?

34:47.829 --> 34:49.505
I saw his face when he told me.

34:49.532 --> 34:51.152
Terry wouldn't make that up.

34:51.199 --> 34:53.292
You talk to Terry.

34:53.368 --> 34:55.110
I don't talk to the guy anymore.

34:55.136 --> 34:56.987
I don't know where he is... Aah!

34:57.036 --> 34:59.972
You talk to him.

35:00.040 --> 35:03.407
By the end of the day I wanna know where I can find the Engineer.

35:10.883 --> 35:12.908
<i> You get anything from the ice cream man?</i>

35:14.153 --> 35:15.631
Any information, I mean.

35:15.657 --> 35:17.010
What's up, Tony?

35:17.055 --> 35:19.216
What's bothering you?

35:20.592 --> 35:22.526
I just...

35:22.594 --> 35:26.928
I just think there's some lines you set, and you don't cross 'em.

35:26.999 --> 35:28.932
Period.

35:29.000 --> 35:32.766
Otherwise you just keep crossin' 'em one after another, you know,

35:32.837 --> 35:35.271
until you're just lost.

35:35.339 --> 35:37.273
We're partners.

35:37.341 --> 35:38.102
And that matters.

35:38.128 --> 35:39.424
That means something to me.

35:39.476 --> 35:41.410
But I can't do this, Joe.

35:43.380 --> 35:45.610
I'm gonna tell the captain about Daphne,

35:45.682 --> 35:48.116
<i>about wipin' your prints off. </i>

35:48.184 --> 35:50.674
<i>I'm gonna tell him what we did. </i>

35:52.421 --> 35:54.787
I believe you didn't kill that girl.

35:54.857 --> 35:56.791
Tell him with me.

35:56.859 --> 36:00.158
<i>It's the right thing to do. </i>

36:00.229 --> 36:04.358
Well, you're right about one thing, Tony.

36:04.432 --> 36:07.060
I didn't kill that girl.

36:07.135 --> 36:11.003
And I'm not gonna let anything get in the way of me finding out who did.

36:15.275 --> 36:17.709
Where's your pen?

36:19.780 --> 36:21.714
Your pen.

36:21.782 --> 36:23.610
The one with your initials on it.

36:23.636 --> 36:25.139
The one your wife gave you.

36:26.185 --> 36:27.675
I don't know.

36:29.955 --> 36:30.675
That's right.

36:30.701 --> 36:32.915
It's probably at the crime lab by now.

36:32.958 --> 36:34.580
Forensics picked it up.

36:34.606 --> 36:36.509
You left it at the scene.

36:36.561 --> 36:40.361
<i>And that last pack of cigarettes you smoked,</i>

36:40.432 --> 36:43.367
the one with your fingerprints all over the wrapper...

36:43.435 --> 36:45.835
You left your smokes there too, Tony.

36:45.904 --> 36:48.303
- You took my cigarettes?
- <i>No. </i>

36:48.372 --> 36:49.152
No, no, no.

36:49.178 --> 36:51.093
You came to me, remember?

36:51.141 --> 36:52.631
- I what?
- <i>Yeah. </i>

36:52.710 --> 36:54.803
Yeah, 'cause you fucked some whore...

36:54.878 --> 36:57.812
and, holy shit, found her dead the next morning.

36:57.880 --> 37:01.680
You asked me to help you wipe the place clean, cover your tracks.

37:01.751 --> 37:04.276
I should never have done it,

37:04.353 --> 37:07.720
but as anyone knows, I am nothing if not a loyal partner.

37:07.790 --> 37:10.656
<i>You have two years in the precinct. </i>

37:10.726 --> 37:13.661
Now, who do you think they're gonna believe, me or you?

37:13.729 --> 37:16.220
Especially considering all the evidence.

37:16.298 --> 37:18.232
You fuckin' scumbag.

37:18.300 --> 37:19.131
You planned it?

37:19.157 --> 37:21.259
You fucked me, and you planned this?

37:21.302 --> 37:24.567
<i>No. </i>
<i>Nobody is gonna get fucked. </i>

37:24.638 --> 37:27.072
You see,
that is the beauty of it.

37:27.141 --> 37:29.939
When the crime lab files its report,

37:30.010 --> 37:33.570
<i>I'll tell the captain that you were
shaken up by what we found at the scene. </i>

37:33.646 --> 37:37.776
I saw you have a smoke and touch a few
things before you put on the gloves.

37:37.851 --> 37:39.238
<i>It's a simple mistake.</i>

37:39.264 --> 37:42.539
<i>The worst you're gonna get is a verbal reprimand. </i>

37:42.588 --> 37:45.523
I don't want to make you look bad.

37:45.591 --> 37:47.525
I'll take care of you.

37:48.694 --> 37:50.787
Just gotta cover my ass, that's all.

37:52.865 --> 37:54.798
And I trusted you.

38:11.681 --> 38:13.234
Detective Thorne?

38:13.260 --> 38:14.903
This is for you.

38:44.912 --> 38:49.349
Stop. Please stop.

38:49.416 --> 38:51.349
No more. No. No!

39:05.697 --> 39:08.097
<i>Please! Please!</i>

40:02.382 --> 40:05.249
This...

40:06.887 --> 40:08.854
I don't
understand this.

40:08.921 --> 40:12.982
<i>Can you run a test on the videotape to see if it's been erased?</i>

40:13.058 --> 40:16.186
I can tell if it's been erased, but I can't
tell you what was on it before that,

40:16.262 --> 40:18.492
if anything.

40:18.564 --> 40:19.922
I know what was on it.

40:19.948 --> 40:21.182
I know what I saw.

40:21.232 --> 40:25.259
<i> Joseph, we've already been through the entire tape twice. </i>

40:25.336 --> 40:26.895
- <i>There's nothing there. </i>

40:26.921 --> 40:28.728
- I saw what I fucking saw!

40:29.807 --> 40:31.433
<i>Gentlemen, let's move on. </i>

40:31.508 --> 40:33.442
We all have
work to do.

40:33.510 --> 40:36.343
Joseph, if you could stay here a moment, please.

40:38.482 --> 40:40.541
<i>I'm concerned about your state of mind. </i>

40:40.617 --> 40:42.243
Bernie's your snitch, right?

40:42.318 --> 40:44.343
<i>Was</i> my snitch.

40:44.420 --> 40:47.583
And you knew the first victim, Jay Cho.

40:47.657 --> 40:49.179
I barely knew him.

40:49.205 --> 40:50.810
It was years ago.

40:50.860 --> 40:53.596
My instincts keep telling me something's not right here.

40:53.622 --> 40:54.581
I'm very concerned.

40:54.629 --> 40:56.563
<i>Now, I could suspend you,</i>

40:56.631 --> 40:59.099
but I won't do that.

40:59.167 --> 41:03.001
However, I will make a formal request that you see the department counselor.

41:03.071 --> 41:04.886
I don't have time for that, Captain.

41:04.912 --> 41:06.531
There's a child's life at stake.

41:06.573 --> 41:08.041
All the more reason.

41:08.067 --> 41:09.533
It's not optional.

41:09.576 --> 41:13.444
<i>Now, go make an appointment before
you do any more work on this case. </i>

41:19.485 --> 41:22.420
Expect to see me come out in handcuffs?

41:22.488 --> 41:25.582
No. Why?
Did you do somethin' bad?

41:34.633 --> 41:36.601
<i>Leon Gaultier. </i>

41:36.668 --> 41:39.295
His fingerprints were on the box.

41:39.370 --> 41:41.270
The box?

41:41.339 --> 41:44.103
<i>The one at the Jay Cho crime scene. </i>

41:44.175 --> 41:46.109
It was under the candle.

41:46.177 --> 41:48.111
<i> Jay stole it from Leon. </i>

41:48.179 --> 41:50.476
Thanks for keepin' me informed, partner.

41:50.547 --> 41:52.481
I'm telling you, Tony,

41:52.549 --> 41:55.484
I saw the murder weapon, the one that killed Bernie.

41:55.552 --> 41:58.077
It was on the wall at Leon's shop.

41:58.154 --> 42:01.088
What, the whip on the videotape?

42:03.158 --> 42:05.149
<i> Just find Leon... </i>

42:05.227 --> 42:07.161
and pick him up, okay?

42:07.229 --> 42:09.390
And keep an eye out for Bernie's van.

42:09.416 --> 42:10.951
What are you gonna do?

42:13.001 --> 42:15.936
I'm gonna go lie down and talk about my childhood.

42:18.006 --> 42:22.466
<i>So, were you involved in the use of deadly force?</i>

42:22.543 --> 42:24.476
Not lately.

42:25.846 --> 42:28.007
Substance problems?

42:28.081 --> 42:28.902
- <i>Problems at home?</i>

42:28.928 --> 42:30.870
- Didn't the captain tell you why I'm here?

42:32.419 --> 42:34.648
No.
Why are you here?

42:34.720 --> 42:38.986
Well, not because I want to be.

42:39.058 --> 42:40.992
Please sit down.

42:44.030 --> 42:46.277
These sessions are informal.

42:46.303 --> 42:49.754
We can just talk about anything you like.

42:49.801 --> 42:51.089
- <i>That's a nice picture. </i>

42:51.115 --> 42:52.659
- <i>It's my daughter Melissa. </i>

42:52.704 --> 42:54.865
- She's six.
- I have a little girl too.

42:54.939 --> 42:57.168
She's gonna be nine in about a month.

42:57.241 --> 42:59.732
So I take it you're not a priest?

42:59.810 --> 43:02.074
Episcopal.

43:02.146 --> 43:04.080
We get to have a little fun.

43:05.682 --> 43:08.616
She's the best thing in my life.

43:09.752 --> 43:11.811
I envy children.

43:11.888 --> 43:13.822
I envy their innocence.

43:14.891 --> 43:16.916
Yeah. Me too.

43:16.993 --> 43:18.853
<i>That's a Chinese thing, right?</i>

43:18.879 --> 43:19.747
<i>For stress. </i>

43:19.795 --> 43:21.729
Oh, that...

43:23.799 --> 43:26.233
just keeps me in the zone.

43:27.669 --> 43:30.228
Close-up magic.

43:30.304 --> 43:32.417
I bet your daughter loves that.

43:32.443 --> 43:33.696
<i>I don't know. </i>

43:35.276 --> 43:38.768
I guess I just mostly use it to entertain myself.

43:38.846 --> 43:40.939
<i>Listen,</i>

43:43.349 --> 43:46.750
could we, um, reschedule this for some other time?

43:46.820 --> 43:48.754
'Cause I haven't got much sleep.

43:48.822 --> 43:50.993
How about tomorrow at 10:00?

43:51.019 --> 43:52.646
Oh. Okay. Sure.

43:55.594 --> 43:57.619
Thank you.

43:57.696 --> 43:59.630
Take care, Detective.

44:05.470 --> 44:08.701
<i> Dr. Gregory said that he envied the innocence of children. </i>

44:08.773 --> 44:12.937
<i>But staring at the faces of a thousand missing kids,</i>

44:13.010 --> 44:15.739
<i>envy is the last thing you feel. </i>

44:15.812 --> 44:18.576
<i>All I felt was rage. </i>

44:19.916 --> 44:24.080
<i>Children are the only sacred thing left in this world. </i>

44:24.154 --> 44:26.986
<i>And most of these little ones were gone for good. </i>

44:27.056 --> 44:29.422
<i>But not the kid I was looking for. </i>

44:29.492 --> 44:32.086
<i>That child was still alive. </i>

44:32.161 --> 44:36.598
<i>If I could keep it that way, I knew it would
be the best thing I'd do in my lifetime. </i>

44:50.611 --> 44:52.176
Hey yourself, Detective.

44:52.202 --> 44:53.571
What's the problem?

44:57.484 --> 45:00.145
They found your snitch.

45:04.090 --> 45:07.313
I got three of my guys up there running around.

45:07.339 --> 45:08.882
All right, thanks.

45:10.929 --> 45:13.659
It's another fuckin' mess,

45:13.732 --> 45:15.666
just like you described it.

45:15.734 --> 45:17.861
Are you surprised?

45:17.936 --> 45:19.870
No, not really.

45:19.938 --> 45:21.808
- <i> You got two of those?</i>

45:21.834 --> 45:23.625
- <i> Yeah, here's one. </i>

45:24.742 --> 45:26.505
<i>Mark that "B."</i>

45:26.577 --> 45:30.206
<i>All right, everybody just, uh, just get out. </i>

45:40.690 --> 45:42.783
It's got a voice mail.

45:42.859 --> 45:46.453
You have one unheard voice message.

45:46.528 --> 45:47.477
Bernie, it's Terry.

45:47.503 --> 45:50.250
Listen, about the per... the thing we talked about...

45:50.299 --> 45:54.633
Find Mr. Parmaggi at a place called The
Crossing at the end of Old Mining Road.

45:54.703 --> 45:56.049
Now we're even, all right?

45:56.075 --> 45:57.992
After this, I don't owe you a dime.

45:58.039 --> 46:00.974
End of message.

46:02.143 --> 46:04.577
Doesn't this guy usually give us a finger?

46:04.645 --> 46:06.636
Yeah, but we ain't found one yet.

46:06.714 --> 46:09.204
- <i> The cash register. </i>
- What?

46:09.282 --> 46:12.683
It's in the fucking cash register!

46:17.057 --> 46:19.991
It was on the fucking videotape!

46:23.062 --> 46:25.690
Let's go, partner.

46:31.436 --> 46:34.599
<i>Maybe this guy just wants his box back. </i>

46:34.672 --> 46:38.233
No, that box was left in plain sight at the first murder scene.

46:38.309 --> 46:41.175
<i>If he wanted the box, he'd have it by now. </i>

46:41.245 --> 46:44.772
No, this figures for some kind of message.

46:44.848 --> 46:49.911
He's telling me if I keep looking for him
he's gonna kill that child, and I'll die too.

46:49.987 --> 46:52.887
Hunt for the Engineer, and the Engineer will hunt you.

46:52.955 --> 46:57.221
- What?
- He won't have to hunt for long, I can tell you that.

47:14.475 --> 47:16.739
You with me?

47:16.810 --> 47:18.903
Whatever you say, partner.

48:19.468 --> 48:22.061
Well, I see chips, but I...

48:22.136 --> 48:24.070
I don't see a cashier.

48:25.573 --> 48:27.507
You know where I can buy in?

48:29.777 --> 48:31.938
I'm looking for Mr. Parmaggi.

48:32.013 --> 48:33.843
Does he still work here?

48:33.914 --> 48:36.348
I do,

48:36.416 --> 48:39.385
and I know all the faces,

48:39.453 --> 48:42.388
though I can't say I remember yours.

48:42.456 --> 48:43.866
Those six-guns look real.

48:43.892 --> 48:45.415
Are you here to play?

48:47.159 --> 48:50.686
I have a permit for the guns, if you'd like to see it.

48:57.669 --> 48:59.796
Are you the Engineer?

49:00.872 --> 49:02.999
You flatter me, sir.

49:04.943 --> 49:06.876
Well,

49:06.944 --> 49:09.208
I'm not going away.

49:09.279 --> 49:12.214
You can tell him that. Okay?

49:12.282 --> 49:16.343
I got his message, and you can give him this message for me:

49:16.420 --> 49:20.856
I'm not gonna stop until I find that child... alive.

49:20.923 --> 49:22.857
I can assure you, Detective,

49:22.925 --> 49:27.589
you're quite mistaken about the Engineer's... message.

49:27.663 --> 49:30.426
Don't fuck with me.

49:30.499 --> 49:33.991
You like to play games, don't you, Detective?

49:34.069 --> 49:37.004
<i>The Engineer likes games,</i>

49:37.072 --> 49:41.508
and it appears that you're playing one of his games right now.

49:43.277 --> 49:46.974
He doesn't want you to stop.

49:47.047 --> 49:50.016
He wants you to play the game.

49:51.618 --> 49:54.553
You think this is a goddamn game?

51:06.420 --> 51:08.615
Tony?

51:53.429 --> 51:56.989
I'm still gonna find that child.

51:58.200 --> 52:00.134
That, I suspect,

52:00.202 --> 52:02.534
is the object of the game.

52:22.222 --> 52:25.589
<i> Joseph! Joe. </i>

52:27.727 --> 52:28.875
Holy shit.

52:28.901 --> 52:30.049
Come on.

52:41.439 --> 52:43.373
Turn it off.

52:43.441 --> 52:46.569
Turn it off!

52:46.644 --> 52:49.374
I've been trying to keep you conscious.

52:50.981 --> 52:51.982
Where are we going?

52:52.008 --> 52:52.961
<i>To the hospital.</i>

52:52.987 --> 52:54.271
<i>We're gettin'close. </i>

52:54.318 --> 52:55.115
I'm sorry, man.

52:55.141 --> 52:56.497
I got lost in the woods.

52:56.523 --> 52:57.904
I should have been there.

52:57.955 --> 53:00.788
- <i>Take me to the house. </i>
- What?

53:00.857 --> 53:02.501
Man, you gotta go to the hospital.

53:02.527 --> 53:03.372
You're fucked up.

53:03.426 --> 53:04.724
- <i>You could have a concussion. </i>

53:04.750 --> 53:06.215
- Just take me back to the squad!

53:15.570 --> 53:16.253
Joseph?

53:16.279 --> 53:18.325
I need to talk.

53:18.373 --> 53:20.568
Of course.
Please come in.

53:24.211 --> 53:25.030
Are you all right?

53:25.056 --> 53:26.602
Yeah, I think I'm losing it.

53:26.647 --> 53:28.293
Why don't you sit down?

53:28.319 --> 53:29.607
What do you mean?

53:29.650 --> 53:32.414
I think I'm going insane.

53:32.486 --> 53:36.012
That's a thought insane people rarely have.

53:36.089 --> 53:38.922
Joseph, please, sit down.

53:38.992 --> 53:43.088
I'm afraid if I sit down, I'm never gonna get up again.

53:47.299 --> 53:49.233
Years ago...

53:49.301 --> 53:51.769
when I was first on the force,

53:51.837 --> 53:55.329
I heard about somebody called the Engineer.

53:55.407 --> 53:57.398
I always thought it was just a...

53:57.476 --> 54:01.707
some campfire story to scare academy cadets and rookies.

54:01.779 --> 54:04.145
And then today,

54:04.215 --> 54:07.275
I heard his name again.

54:09.552 --> 54:12.544
You know what I'm talking about?

54:12.622 --> 54:14.784
Oh, please, continue what you were...

54:14.810 --> 54:16.174
Answer my question!

54:17.961 --> 54:20.554
What do you know about the Engineer?

54:51.825 --> 54:55.487
I've returned to this file many times.

54:55.561 --> 54:58.928
It was 1986, my first year as department counselor.

55:00.733 --> 55:03.702
He was a veteran like you, good at his job.

55:03.769 --> 55:06.601
Until he caught a case where everything led to one man...

55:06.671 --> 55:10.198
known only by his street name, the Engineer.

55:10.275 --> 55:14.371
This detective began to mistrust his own instincts.

55:15.947 --> 55:18.176
Self-doubt grew into paranoia.

55:18.248 --> 55:20.614
<i>And in his delusions,</i>

55:20.684 --> 55:23.983
<i>he elevated the Engineer into a figure of almost supernatural power. </i>

55:24.054 --> 55:28.251
He said the Engineer knew everything about every cop on the force,

55:28.324 --> 55:30.884
<i>especially him. </i>

55:30.960 --> 55:34.225
His anxiety rapidly shifted into a deep depression...

55:35.698 --> 55:39.394
till one day he came to work, sat down behind his desk...

55:40.736 --> 55:42.670
and shot himself in the head.

55:46.475 --> 55:49.171
What do you see there?

55:49.244 --> 55:52.838
The detective had it with him when he shot himself.

55:52.913 --> 55:56.781
I must admit that I was intrigued enough to actually go and look for it,

55:56.851 --> 55:59.251
<i>but when I checked the evidence archives,</i>

55:59.320 --> 56:01.412
it was gone.

56:01.488 --> 56:04.082
So it's probably either lost or destroyed by now.

56:04.157 --> 56:07.024
<i>All that's left of it is the picture. </i>

56:15.334 --> 56:17.131
What is it?

56:17.202 --> 56:19.975
<i>You couldn't get it out of your head.</i>

56:20.001 --> 56:21.459
<i>I think you know. </i>

56:23.375 --> 56:24.363
You're right.

56:24.389 --> 56:26.061
I did some research.

56:27.545 --> 56:30.105
It's called the Lament Configuration.

56:31.883 --> 56:34.976
It appears in occult literature here and there throughout the centuries.

56:35.051 --> 56:37.042
What do they say about it?

56:37.120 --> 56:41.056
<i>They say it's a window or a gateway. </i>

56:41.124 --> 56:43.058
You open it,

56:43.126 --> 56:46.720
they come for you and they tear you apart.

56:49.398 --> 56:51.332
"They"?

56:51.400 --> 56:52.717
Some call them Cenobites.

56:52.743 --> 56:55.691
Others call them demons and say they take you to hell.

56:55.738 --> 56:58.763
Well, they didn't take me to hell.

57:01.743 --> 57:03.231
You opened the box?

57:03.257 --> 57:05.135
<i>Yeah, last night. </i>

57:06.181 --> 57:09.581
I had some... nightmare,

57:09.650 --> 57:11.914
and...

57:11.985 --> 57:13.919
ever since then,

57:13.987 --> 57:16.182
I've been seeing...

57:17.491 --> 57:19.425
them.

57:22.361 --> 57:26.525
Am I going crazy?

57:28.267 --> 57:32.032
I'm more of a psychiatrist than I am a priest.

57:32.103 --> 57:36.130
Ask me if I believe in the devil, I don't know what to say.

57:36.208 --> 57:38.972
But ask me about this box,

57:39.044 --> 57:41.376
from what I've seen and read,

57:41.446 --> 57:43.379
I believe it's real.

57:43.447 --> 57:46.678
<i>But the history's consistent. </i>

57:46.750 --> 57:49.878
It opens, they come for you...

57:49.954 --> 57:51.888
and they leave.

57:51.956 --> 57:55.118
<i>So if you're saying they left you behind,</i>

57:55.191 --> 57:58.217
and you're still seeing them,

57:58.294 --> 58:00.489
then maybe they're still here.

58:08.804 --> 58:11.170
<i>I live in a world of facts,</i>

58:11.240 --> 58:13.504
<i>of close attention to detail. </i>

58:13.575 --> 58:15.838
<i>No matter how confusing the mystery,</i>

58:15.910 --> 58:18.208
<i>no matter how difficult the puzzle,</i>

58:18.279 --> 58:22.909
<i>the answer is always seen and the end is natural as rain. </i>

58:22.984 --> 58:26.852
<i>Everything... every process, no matter how complex,</i>

58:26.920 --> 58:29.184
<i>is a piece of reality in the end. </i>

58:29.256 --> 58:32.089
<i>And the design can be understood. </i>

58:32.158 --> 58:35.753
<i>All things can eventually be explained. </i>

58:35.829 --> 58:39.924
<i>But maybe some facts are in the eye of the beholder. </i>

58:39.999 --> 58:41.933
Mommy, wait!

58:42.001 --> 58:46.165
<i>And maybe some explanations are not of this world. </i>

58:46.238 --> 58:48.832
<i>Help me!</i>

59:04.788 --> 59:06.023
Where have you been?

59:06.049 --> 59:07.377
You've not called me.

59:07.403 --> 59:08.579
I have paged you.

59:08.625 --> 59:11.889
Told you I was working a case.

59:11.961 --> 59:15.294
Why do you keep lying to me, Joseph?

59:15.364 --> 59:18.094
You cannot keep doing this.
We...

59:18.167 --> 59:18.984
Oh, my God.

59:19.010 --> 59:20.717
What happened to you?

59:20.770 --> 59:24.102
<i>I got jumped by a couple of guys, but I'm all right. </i>

59:24.172 --> 59:28.336
Daddy, are you home yet?

59:28.410 --> 59:30.119
No, sweetheart, I'm just...

59:30.145 --> 59:33.372
I'm here for a little while, and then I gotta go.

59:33.415 --> 59:35.712
Come in here with me.

59:35.783 --> 59:39.184
- When are you coming home?
- Shh.

59:39.253 --> 59:43.087
Sweetie, just go back to sleep.

01:00:59.625 --> 01:01:01.684
Hello?

01:01:01.761 --> 01:01:04.354
<i>Hi. How are you?</i>

01:01:07.065 --> 01:01:08.216
<i>Wait!</i>

01:01:08.242 --> 01:01:10.082
<i>Hello?</i>

01:01:10.135 --> 01:01:12.069
<i>Hello?</i>

01:01:14.439 --> 01:01:17.271
<i>That was your mother. </i>

01:01:17.341 --> 01:01:20.674
- What?
- She said that she had a visitor.

01:01:20.744 --> 01:01:23.975
<i>Someone that you were looking for, or something like that?</i>

01:01:24.048 --> 01:01:27.813
I think that she said he was some kind of engineer.

01:01:32.755 --> 01:01:35.349
I don't want you to leave this house.

01:01:35.425 --> 01:01:38.086
Do you understand me?

01:01:40.395 --> 01:01:43.330
I want you to lock all the doors and the windows.

01:01:43.398 --> 01:01:45.699
Do you remember how to use this?

01:01:45.725 --> 01:01:47.018
Do you remember?

01:01:47.069 --> 01:01:50.003
Yes! Are you in some kind of trouble?

01:01:50.071 --> 01:01:52.071
Yes, I am.

01:01:52.097 --> 01:01:53.896
We are.

01:01:53.941 --> 01:01:56.432
Daddy?

01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:58.191
Just do as I say.

01:01:58.217 --> 01:01:59.402
<i>Daddy?</i>

01:01:59.447 --> 01:02:02.210
Please, just tell me something!

01:02:02.282 --> 01:02:04.216
Daddy!

01:02:04.284 --> 01:02:05.630
It's okay, baby.

01:02:05.656 --> 01:02:07.506
I want my daddy.

01:02:07.554 --> 01:02:09.681
Daddy's gone.

01:02:30.742 --> 01:02:32.676
Can I help you, sir?

01:02:32.744 --> 01:02:34.617
Yes, I'm here to see Art and Mary Thorne.

01:02:34.643 --> 01:02:35.669
I'm their son, Joseph.

01:02:35.712 --> 01:02:37.703
I didn't know the Thornes had a son.

01:02:39.783 --> 01:02:43.344
Did they have any other visitors today?

01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:45.546
Are you sure you're really their son?

01:02:45.621 --> 01:02:49.557
Look, lady, this is an emergency.

01:02:53.095 --> 01:02:55.563
They had no other visitors today,

01:02:55.631 --> 01:02:58.724
or any other day that I can remember.

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:00.459
<i>You'll have to sign in.</i>

01:03:00.485 --> 01:03:01.350
<i>Room 116.</i>

01:03:01.402 --> 01:03:03.563
Sir, you have to check in.

01:03:03.638 --> 01:03:05.572
Sir, please slow down.

01:03:34.633 --> 01:03:37.227
What a fine-looking boy.

01:04:02.826 --> 01:04:05.919
<i>Mom, you guys okay?</i>

01:04:05.994 --> 01:04:07.928
<i>Why don't you visit us, Joe?</i>

01:04:07.996 --> 01:04:10.829
He gets a little worse every day.

01:04:25.012 --> 01:04:28.071
We never see you anymore.

01:04:28.148 --> 01:04:30.082
We don't like it here.

01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:34.814
I don't know, Mom.
L... I try.

01:04:42.528 --> 01:04:45.122
<i>Help me!</i>

01:04:51.302 --> 01:04:53.600
<i> Joseph Thorne?</i>

01:04:53.671 --> 01:04:55.935
You put that thing away.

01:05:28.403 --> 01:05:31.839
Mom? Mom, let me in.

01:05:31.907 --> 01:05:34.898
<i> Please, no. </i>

01:05:34.975 --> 01:05:37.739
<i> Oh, God!</i>

01:05:57.396 --> 01:05:59.330
Stop!

01:06:31.293 --> 01:06:33.227
<i>Hello?</i>

01:06:34.396 --> 01:06:35.569
<i>Oh, h i. </i>

01:06:35.595 --> 01:06:37.288
<i>How are you?</i>

01:06:37.333 --> 01:06:40.460
Wait.
Hello?

01:06:40.535 --> 01:06:42.469
Hello?

01:06:44.372 --> 01:06:47.466
- That was your mother.
- What?

01:06:47.542 --> 01:06:50.375
She said that she had a visitor.

01:06:50.445 --> 01:06:52.935
Someone that you were looking for, or something like that?

01:06:53.013 --> 01:06:56.608
I think that she said he was some kind of an engineer.

01:07:08.661 --> 01:07:10.595
Sir? Sir, wait!

01:07:10.663 --> 01:07:12.597
That man had a gun!

01:07:17.969 --> 01:07:20.403
<i>Don't you fuckin'move!</i>

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:24.800
<i>Drop it!</i>

01:07:26.877 --> 01:07:28.811
Turn around.

01:07:32.383 --> 01:07:34.817
I'm with the Denver P.D.

01:07:34.885 --> 01:07:35.846
I'm a detective.

01:07:35.872 --> 01:07:37.673
I'm looking for the Thornes.

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:40.120
<i>Yes, we've been expecting you. </i>

01:07:40.189 --> 01:07:43.420
If you had only shown some identification...

01:07:44.861 --> 01:07:45.677
I'm their son.

01:07:45.703 --> 01:07:48.150
I didn't know the Thornes had a son.

01:07:54.336 --> 01:07:56.270
They're not here, sir.

01:07:56.338 --> 01:07:58.704
We called the police almost an hour ago.

01:07:58.774 --> 01:08:02.834
They've been missing since dinner, and we've searched all around.

01:08:02.910 --> 01:08:05.344
They just seem to have vanished.

01:08:21.627 --> 01:08:23.560
<i>So strange. </i>

01:08:23.629 --> 01:08:26.621
Mr. Thorne isn't able to leave the bed anymore...

01:08:26.698 --> 01:08:28.859
and they've never been prone to wander,

01:08:28.934 --> 01:08:31.198
like some of our...

01:09:46.705 --> 01:09:49.139
Hey. Your wife said you might be here.

01:09:51.642 --> 01:09:53.576
Tony.

01:09:53.644 --> 01:09:56.738
Look, I know you have no reason to trust me right now,

01:09:56.814 --> 01:09:59.749
but I just got a little note from the Engineer.

01:09:59.817 --> 01:10:02.035
I want you to come with me to this address.

01:10:02.061 --> 01:10:03.572
Captain wants to see you.

01:10:05.522 --> 01:10:07.456
Did you tell him about Daphne?

01:10:07.524 --> 01:10:08.405
No, not yet.

01:10:08.431 --> 01:10:10.484
You're outta control, Joe.

01:10:10.527 --> 01:10:11.827
Well, then come with me!

01:10:11.853 --> 01:10:13.748
We can catch this son of a bitch!

01:10:13.795 --> 01:10:16.320
We can... We can end all this!

01:10:17.566 --> 01:10:19.308
Tony, I need you, man.

01:10:19.334 --> 01:10:21.391
I'm fucking scared here.

01:10:21.436 --> 01:10:22.581
Then come in with me.

01:10:22.607 --> 01:10:24.598
We'll talk to the captain together.

01:10:24.633 --> 01:10:26.516
And tell him what, huh?

01:10:26.542 --> 01:10:28.997
Tell him about the Engineer?

01:10:29.043 --> 01:10:31.807
He's not gonna believe my story until I can prove...

01:10:31.879 --> 01:10:34.143
that the Engineer is the connection!

01:10:34.215 --> 01:10:36.194
He's not the fuckin' connection, Joe!

01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:37.834
You're the fuckin' connection!

01:10:37.884 --> 01:10:41.445
<i>You knew Daphne, Bernie and Jay Cho. </i>

01:10:41.521 --> 01:10:43.455
There is no Engineer.

01:10:45.559 --> 01:10:48.083
There's just you.

01:10:58.937 --> 01:11:01.167
- Son of a...
- <i>Get up!</i>

01:11:01.239 --> 01:11:03.173
Bitch.

01:11:03.241 --> 01:11:06.108
You really think I could kill those people?

01:11:06.177 --> 01:11:08.111
You really think I could do that?

01:11:08.179 --> 01:11:10.772
You were with the girl, you knew about Bernie...

01:11:10.847 --> 01:11:15.079
and there was nothin' on the goddamn videotape,
and you knew where to find the finger.

01:11:15.152 --> 01:11:17.586
What am I supposed to think, huh?

01:11:19.223 --> 01:11:19.974
Come on, man.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.442
I didn't mean to do that.

01:11:21.468 --> 01:11:22.332
Now, come on.

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:27.796
Do you really think I could do those things?

01:11:27.863 --> 01:11:29.797
<i>I don't know,  Joseph. </i>

01:11:29.865 --> 01:11:33.493
You ask me yesterday, I-I'd say, "No fuckin' way," but today,

01:11:33.568 --> 01:11:36.537
<i>I just don't know. </i>

01:11:42.577 --> 01:11:44.510
You need help, Joe.

01:11:44.578 --> 01:11:46.512
Go to hell.

01:13:42.219 --> 01:13:44.779
<i>Tony?</i>

01:13:44.855 --> 01:13:46.788
<i>No. </i>

01:14:24.391 --> 01:14:26.655
Six fingers,

01:14:26.726 --> 01:14:28.660
six murders.

01:14:30.296 --> 01:14:32.820
Only four fingers left.

01:14:39.972 --> 01:14:42.406
Do you know who I am, Detective?

01:14:43.474 --> 01:14:47.501
Oh, let me guess.

01:14:47.578 --> 01:14:49.569
You're the Engineer.

01:14:52.417 --> 01:14:54.350
I got your message,

01:14:54.418 --> 01:14:56.852
and I understand your fucking game.

01:14:58.321 --> 01:15:00.585
Is the child even alive?

01:15:06.829 --> 01:15:09.491
What do you want from me?

01:15:09.565 --> 01:15:12.295
I want you to go home, Detective.

01:15:12.368 --> 01:15:14.359
Time to go home.

01:15:17.071 --> 01:15:19.471
We have an officer down.

01:15:19.541 --> 01:15:21.873
Mountain Vista Elementary School.

01:15:21.943 --> 01:15:23.122
I don't know the address.

01:15:23.148 --> 01:15:24.232
I'm not at the scene.

01:15:24.279 --> 01:15:27.645
Just get a unit there immediately. Out.

01:16:17.727 --> 01:16:20.321
<i>Welcome home, Detective. </i>

01:16:25.067 --> 01:16:28.264
<i>It takes hours to die from exposure. </i>

01:16:28.337 --> 01:16:30.999
<i>Hours in which no one came home. </i>

01:16:32.074 --> 01:16:34.837
No one was here to hear them cry.

01:16:37.912 --> 01:16:41.245
<i>Why do you keep lying to me, Joseph?</i>

01:16:41.315 --> 01:16:43.442
You can't keep doing this.

01:16:43.518 --> 01:16:44.555
<i>Daddy?</i>

01:16:44.581 --> 01:16:47.171
<i>Are you home?</i>

01:16:51.324 --> 01:16:54.297
Yes, baby, Daddy's home.

01:16:54.323 --> 01:16:55.809
He's here.

01:16:55.862 --> 01:16:57.795
I miss you, Daddy.

01:16:57.863 --> 01:17:00.195
When are you coming home?

01:18:04.657 --> 01:18:06.591
They found Tony.

01:18:06.659 --> 01:18:11.221
<i>And the child's finger, the one the killer left in his mouth. </i>

01:18:11.297 --> 01:18:13.561
<i>Only this time the print wasn't burned off. </i>

01:18:13.633 --> 01:18:16.624
They ran the print taken from the severed finger...

01:18:16.702 --> 01:18:21.605
and like a miracle, got a match almost instantly.

01:18:21.673 --> 01:18:25.507
<i>What they found doesn't make any sense though, Joseph,</i>

01:18:25.577 --> 01:18:28.704
because the child's fingerprint...

01:18:28.779 --> 01:18:30.713
Well, it's yours.

01:18:33.284 --> 01:18:35.411
I don't understand.

01:18:37.455 --> 01:18:39.513
I know.

01:18:39.589 --> 01:18:42.581
You even misunderstood me when I told you to go home.

01:18:42.659 --> 01:18:44.593
I didn't mean this place.

01:18:46.196 --> 01:18:48.130
I meant your first home.

01:18:48.198 --> 01:18:50.461
<i>The home you grew up in. </i>

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:53.534
<i>I can help you understand. </i>

01:18:53.602 --> 01:18:57.038
You see, I know everything about you, Joseph.

01:19:00.808 --> 01:19:02.742
Your file's almost complete.

01:19:20.894 --> 01:19:23.157
You're the Engineer.

01:19:26.298 --> 01:19:28.732
It's as good a name as any.

01:19:55.259 --> 01:19:57.192
What are you?

01:19:57.260 --> 01:20:02.527
What I am, who I am, is no concern of yours.

01:20:04.567 --> 01:20:07.331
I am not the killer.

01:20:07.403 --> 01:20:09.336
To find him,

01:20:09.404 --> 01:20:12.168
you must go back to the place from which you started.

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:14.765
<i>Go back, Joseph. </i>

01:20:14.843 --> 01:20:17.744
Go home.

01:21:21.504 --> 01:21:25.873
<i> Joseph? Joseph Thorne?</i>

01:22:07.312 --> 01:22:09.246
Dad?

01:22:25.261 --> 01:22:28.389
<i>I made brownies, Joseph, your favorite. </i>

01:22:45.580 --> 01:22:48.014
<i>You know why I baked you brownies, Joe?</i>

01:22:48.082 --> 01:22:50.141
<i>'Cause you're such a good boy. </i>

01:23:01.928 --> 01:23:05.227
I love you, Joseph.

01:23:05.298 --> 01:23:09.961
We'll save some of these for your father for when he wakes up from his nap.

01:23:16.442 --> 01:23:18.375
Mom?

01:24:09.156 --> 01:24:11.556
<i>Why don't you visit us, Joe?</i>

01:24:11.625 --> 01:24:14.093
We never see you anymore.

01:24:14.161 --> 01:24:17.186
- We don't like it here.
- Mom?

01:24:20.266 --> 01:24:21.733
Stop!

01:24:33.578 --> 01:24:35.512
Dad?

01:25:30.864 --> 01:25:32.832
Whatever you want,

01:25:32.898 --> 01:25:34.889
as many times as you want it.

01:25:49.147 --> 01:25:52.139
<i>Help me!</i>

01:26:09.165 --> 01:26:11.099
I trusted you.

01:26:12.235 --> 01:26:14.362
Tony, I'm sorry.

01:26:18.974 --> 01:26:20.908
Tony, stop!

01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:30.608
I trusted you!

01:27:03.915 --> 01:27:07.009
That ain't right, you treating me like this, Joe.

01:27:07.085 --> 01:27:07.995
<i>Bernie?</i>

01:27:08.021 --> 01:27:09.445
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:27:09.471 --> 01:27:11.012
I never...

01:27:11.055 --> 01:27:13.580
What am I, your whipping boy?

01:27:25.668 --> 01:27:28.000
<i>Help me!</i>

01:29:24.843 --> 01:29:26.777
You.

01:29:57.073 --> 01:29:59.803
Why?

01:30:02.377 --> 01:30:05.403
<i>It's all a puzzle, isn't it, Joseph?</i>

01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:07.744
<i>Like a game of chess, perhaps. </i>

01:30:07.816 --> 01:30:10.444
The pieces move, apparently aimlessly,

01:30:10.518 --> 01:30:14.613
but always towards one single objective:

01:30:14.688 --> 01:30:17.782
To kill the king.

01:30:17.858 --> 01:30:20.759
Who is the king in this game, Joseph?

01:30:20.828 --> 01:30:24.490
<i>That is the question you must ask yourself. </i>

01:30:24.564 --> 01:30:28.364
Don't you recognize your own flesh,

01:30:28.434 --> 01:30:31.335
your own spirit?

01:30:32.839 --> 01:30:35.273
I don't understand.

01:30:37.542 --> 01:30:40.511
the eternal refrain of humanity...

01:30:40.579 --> 01:30:43.571
pleading ignorance, begging for mercy.

01:30:43.649 --> 01:30:45.191
"Please, help me.

01:30:45.217 --> 01:30:47.302
I don't understand. "

01:30:47.351 --> 01:30:51.412
<i>This is the life you chose, Joseph. </i>

01:30:51.489 --> 01:30:53.423
<i>All the people you hurt,</i>

01:30:53.491 --> 01:30:55.857
all the appetites you indulged.

01:30:55.926 --> 01:30:59.088
<i>You have destroyed your own innocence,</i>

01:30:59.162 --> 01:31:03.189
allowed your flesh to consume your spirit.

01:31:04.768 --> 01:31:07.396
You are your own king,

01:31:07.470 --> 01:31:12.168
and this is the hell you have created for yourself.

01:31:19.048 --> 01:31:20.981
No.

01:31:28.990 --> 01:31:32.652
Your flesh is killing your spirit.

01:31:32.726 --> 01:31:35.889
No!

01:31:37.164 --> 01:31:39.394
Oh, yes, Joseph.

01:31:42.102 --> 01:31:44.797
You have forsaken yourself.

01:31:56.281 --> 01:31:58.977
Only one finger left now, Joseph.

01:32:00.118 --> 01:32:03.110
<i>Only one more death to go. </i>

01:32:21.904 --> 01:32:24.634
Welcome to hell.

01:33:25.362 --> 01:33:28.126
Jesus.
Haven't I earned my money yet?

01:33:30.033 --> 01:33:31.967
I'm sorry.

01:34:12.138 --> 01:34:15.266
- <i>How'd you do?</i>
- What?

01:34:15.341 --> 01:34:16.867
The game last night.

01:34:16.893 --> 01:34:17.960
How'd you do?

01:34:18.010 --> 01:34:20.034
Well, we...

01:34:20.111 --> 01:34:23.308
We won by seven, but it should've been 20.

01:34:23.381 --> 01:34:25.315
<i>Tony no-showed. </i>

01:34:25.383 --> 01:34:27.317
I had to go fishin'.

01:34:31.455 --> 01:34:33.480
Detective Thorne.

01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:38.961
Hey, Joe, it's Daphne.

01:34:39.029 --> 01:34:42.294
I'm the girl you were with last night.

01:34:42.365 --> 01:34:45.596
Please!
I'm still at the motel.

01:34:45.668 --> 01:34:48.466
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.

01:34:48.538 --> 01:34:51.234
What's the matter, Joe?
You okay?

01:34:57.079 --> 01:34:59.070
No, don't do it!

01:35:18.899 --> 01:35:21.333
<i>I lived in a world of facts,</i>

01:35:21.401 --> 01:35:25.132
<i>of a reality that I thought I understood. </i>

01:35:25.205 --> 01:35:27.798
<i>I believed I was the center of the design... </i>

01:35:27.873 --> 01:35:30.637
<i>and I was certain that I knew all the answers. </i>

01:35:32.478 --> 01:35:36.414
<i>But now I face the truth about what I've done to hurt those around me,</i>

01:35:36.482 --> 01:35:40.417
<i>and in hurting them, what I've done to myself. </i>

01:35:43.555 --> 01:35:46.251
<i>I've confronted my own demons,</i>

01:35:46.324 --> 01:35:49.724
<i>and now the only thing I know for certain... </i>

01:35:49.793 --> 01:35:52.318
<i>is that I will live with them forever. </i>

01:35:55.198 --> 01:35:57.462
No!

01:35:59.436 --> 01:36:02.871
<i> ц Dreamed a world ц</i>

01:36:02.939 --> 01:36:04.600
