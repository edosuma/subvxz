Hey! Hey Linda, come here!

02:34.500 --> 02:36.000
Come outside

02:40.900 --> 02:43.100
I wonder what Tokyo looks like,
from up there?

02:43.800 --> 02:44.900
- I don't...
- Why not?

02:47.900 --> 02:50.300
- I'd be scared

02:50.600 --> 02:52.800
- Scared of what?

02:54.300 --> 02:56.000
Dying I guess...

02:57.400 --> 02:59.000
Falling into the void

03:02.800 --> 03:05.600
They say you fly when you die

03:11.000 --> 03:12.800
Its fucking cold

03:19.200 --> 03:21.100
Hey, check out
this book Alex gave me

03:21.400 --> 03:23.400
Its like the Tibetan bible

03:23.600 --> 03:25.300
Alex the junkie?

03:25.600 --> 03:27.500
Its all about
what happens after you die

03:28.200 --> 03:29.200
Look!

03:33.900 --> 03:36.400
So your going
to become a Buddhist now?

03:37.300 --> 03:38.300
No

03:38.600 --> 03:42.800
You know they're all the same
Fucking Catholics, the Jew's ...

03:45.600 --> 03:48.400
Just a bunch of sucks
out to get their hands on your money...

03:50.200 --> 03:52.900
Alex is gonna make
you a junkie...

03:53.100 --> 03:54.000
and then he's going
to make you a fucking Buddhist

03:54.100 --> 03:56.300
No, he's just a friend

03:56.800 --> 03:58.700
I'm not gonna become a buddhist...

03:59.100 --> 04:00.600
Alex is a fucking junkie.

04:01.300 --> 04:03.500
He's not your friend

04:03.700 --> 04:04.700
- C'mon
- He's not your friend

04:07.300 --> 04:08.800
I gotta go

04:13.500 --> 04:16.200
Hey, I'll see you later?

04:18.300 --> 04:19.100
See ya.

04:22.900 --> 04:25.400
Lock the door, just lock the door...

04:27.200 --> 04:28.500
Ok, good

04:33.300 --> 04:35.600
Why does she think I'm a junkie?

04:37.100 --> 04:39.000
I know I'm not a junkie.

04:40.500 --> 04:42.000
I know who I am

04:43.600 --> 04:45.600
I know I'm not a junkie

04:47.300 --> 04:49.800
She's my sister, sometimes
she doesn't know anything

05:11.300 --> 05:12.900
There we go

05:14.700 --> 05:16.200
This is the good stuff

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Why else would Bruno
give this to me?

05:26.200 --> 05:29.600
Probably wants a blowjob.
Thats disgusting!

05:30.700 --> 05:32.400
Who do ya think I am anyways

05:33.200 --> 05:35.100
I know I'm not a junkie

06:13.500 --> 06:14.900
There you go...

06:35.700 --> 06:38.000
This stuff doesn't taste good

06:43.200 --> 06:44.500
These drugs taste like shit

06:55.700 --> 06:57.000
Wow! Its already kicking in

07:01.300 --> 07:03.300
This is it... its started

07:06.600 --> 07:08.400
Oh god, this is the best

07:08.700 --> 07:11.300
What if you faint?

07:12.200 --> 07:13.400
You're not gonna faint

07:15.100 --> 07:18.500
I just know I will
You've done this before...

11:47.900 --> 11:49.900
- Hello...
- Oscar... its Victor.

11:51.300 --> 11:52.900
Hey, I'm looking for you...

11:54.200 --> 11:55.900
Ah, can you bring my stuff?

11:56.500 --> 11:58.500
Can you come and get it

11:58.900 --> 12:00.900
No... I need you to bring it to me

12:01.600 --> 12:03.500
Oh... Ok. Where are you?

12:03.800 --> 12:05.300
I'm at the Void...

12:06.600 --> 12:08.900
Y'know I'm really sorry
about yesterday, I'll wait for you...

12:09.200 --> 12:10.400
Actually...

12:10.800 --> 12:13.000
- Actually I'd rather if you...
- Don't be long...

12:13.300 --> 12:14.400
Hello?

12:15.100 --> 12:19.100
Hello?...
Oh, come on?!

12:34.700 --> 12:36.100
Wake up

12:39.700 --> 12:41.100
Get a hold of yourself

12:44.300 --> 12:46.000
Oh God...

12:46.300 --> 12:47.300
its back

12:58.300 --> 12:59.600
Collect yourself

13:02.600 --> 13:04.000
Balcony

13:05.500 --> 13:07.100
Walk away from that

13:09.600 --> 13:11.500
Keep your eyes open

13:13.300 --> 13:15.200
My head is throbbing now

13:33.300 --> 13:34.900
Its water

13:37.500 --> 13:40.800
Water... Splash water
Splash tap water

13:41.900 --> 13:44.600
Nice clean tap water

13:53.600 --> 13:54.900
Its perfect

14:03.900 --> 14:05.200
Back to normal

14:06.800 --> 14:09.800
Look at your cheeks,
look at your eyes

14:10.300 --> 14:11.700
They look different

14:12.200 --> 14:13.100
Shit

14:15.700 --> 14:17.300
Is that the neighbours?

14:20.000 --> 14:22.400
Did they hear me?
Did I scream? Maybe I did?

14:22.700 --> 14:24.600
Just calm down

14:32.300 --> 14:34.200
Alex. Hold on

14:37.800 --> 14:39.800
Hey Oscar, you alright?

14:40.100 --> 14:42.200
Ah its good man,
how ya doin'

14:42.400 --> 14:45.200
Nothing much...
Been pretty good, pretty good...

14:45.900 --> 14:47.800
I think I need a shower!

14:52.300 --> 14:56.300
Oh, don't go to the balcony,
stay away from the balcony

14:58.800 --> 15:00.800
Hey, have you read the book?

15:01.000 --> 15:01.900
- The book?
- Yeah

15:02.100 --> 15:04.100
- Oh, The Book of The Dead
- Yeah

15:05.400 --> 15:08.100
Yeah, haven't finished
reading it yet, its pretty good.

15:08.300 --> 15:09.600
Its a wild book

15:09.800 --> 15:11.600
I'm glad you like it

15:12.000 --> 15:13.900
Can I keep it,
so I can finish it?

15:14.200 --> 15:16.200
- No problem
- Oh thanks... thanks

15:25.100 --> 15:27.100
- You okay?
- Ah... well...

15:30.200 --> 15:32.200
- I bumped into your sister
- Yeah?

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
Yeah. Following that cunt, Mario

15:36.400 --> 15:38.300
I fuckin' hate that guy

15:38.500 --> 15:40.300
I can't believe she's
going out with him.

15:41.700 --> 15:44.100
If she ever gets pregnant,
I'll kill the baby.

15:44.500 --> 15:45.700
I swear to God.

15:45.800 --> 15:47.800
Hey look, anyway...
Do you mind if we go and see her tonight?

15:48.100 --> 15:49.600
I'd really like to see her...

15:49.900 --> 15:51.400
Yeah sure

15:51.500 --> 15:54.800
First we have to stop at the Void
I have some stuff for Victor

15:55.100 --> 15:56.300
Wanna come?

15:56.700 --> 15:57.900
- The Void?
- Yeah

15:58.100 --> 16:00.000
I don't' like the place,
but I follow you...

16:00.300 --> 16:02.300
...and we go see your sister

16:02.600 --> 16:03.600
- Yeah, lets go
- Great!

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
- Can I grab some water?
- Yeah sure

16:09.000 --> 16:10.200
Water!

16:31.600 --> 16:33.000
You're not taking it all,
are you?

16:33.400 --> 16:35.000
No, only his share

16:35.200 --> 16:37.100
- Man, thats alot of gear
- Yeah

16:38.100 --> 16:40.100
Shit!? Thats fucking dangerous
You should let him pick it up himself

16:40.200 --> 16:42.200
No, he won't come here anymore,

16:42.600 --> 16:45.500
not after what happened with his mother.

16:45.900 --> 16:47.800
- What? He found out
- Yeah...

16:48.300 --> 16:50.300
- How did he find out?
- I don't want to talk about it

16:50.600 --> 16:52.600
Alright, can I take the water?

16:52.800 --> 16:54.000
- Bring it
- Okay

17:04.099 --> 17:07.400
The streets are really empty.
Is it a holiday today?

17:13.200 --> 17:14.900
- Hey whats wrong with you?

17:24.300 --> 17:26.300
- You tripping man?!
- Yeah. You can tell?

17:27.400 --> 17:29.300
Yeah, you look really fucked up...

17:30.400 --> 17:35.900
I popped some tabs this morning...
and just took a hit of DMT before you came...

17:37.900 --> 17:40.100
Shit, looks like a good day!

17:40.400 --> 17:42.400
And the day isn't over either!

17:44.200 --> 17:47.500
Hey, do you think Bruno
has anything stronger than DMT?

17:48.000 --> 17:49.900
C'mon, you'll fry your brain man!

17:51.500 --> 17:55.400
You should finish The Book of The Dead,
that will be a lot better

17:56.000 --> 17:58.900
but wait until you die,
then you get your big trip

17:59.200 --> 18:00.800
The book is still confusing to me

18:01.100 --> 18:03.000
How would you explain it?

18:05.200 --> 18:07.800
Um, its really hard to explain...

18:08.200 --> 18:12.200
basically, when you die...
your spirit leaves your body...

18:12.700 --> 18:15.700
...actually
at first you can see all your life,

18:16.000 --> 18:18.700
like reflected in a magic mirror.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.900
Then you start
floating like a ghost,

18:22.600 --> 18:25.300
you can see anything
happening around you,

18:25.700 --> 18:29.000
you can hear everything
but you can't communicate.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.100
Then you see lights...
lights of all different colours...

18:33.600 --> 18:38.600
these lights are the doors that pull you
into other planes of existence...

18:40.900 --> 18:45.700
but most people... actually

18:46.000 --> 18:51.300
like this world so much,
that they don't want to be taken away,

18:51.800 --> 18:55.300
so the whole thing
turns into a bad trip,

18:55.500 --> 18:58.800
and the only way out
is to get reincarnated.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.800
- Is that making sense?
- Yeah, I guess so...

19:04.000 --> 19:07.500
I dunno, whats the bad trip?

19:08.100 --> 19:13.200
well, you got all these nightmares...
you know, you go like, yo' crazy...

19:13.800 --> 19:18.200
all your fears become reality
and it scares the shit out of you...

19:18.600 --> 19:22.400
Its like whats
happening to your mind, right?

19:25.100 --> 19:27.100
At that point,
you wish you never died...

19:31.900 --> 19:34.200
And, some new lights appear to you

19:35.700 --> 19:37.700
they represent all these couples making love...

19:40.700 --> 19:43.600
and then a light comes out from their bellies,
and if you get closer

19:44.000 --> 19:47.400
they give you a vision
of a possible future life

19:48.000 --> 19:50.800
and you choose a life that suits you the best
you know, end up in the womb...

19:51.300 --> 19:57.000
and you're reincarnated
end of story

19:58.200 --> 20:01.300
and basically you do this
forever and ever...

20:01.700 --> 20:06.100
until you manage to break the circle

20:06.700 --> 20:08.200
you follow me?

20:08.700 --> 20:11.700
So you mean, we're stuck in this world
for all of eternity?

20:12.900 --> 20:15.700
There's nothing better out there?

20:22.300 --> 20:24.300
Hey, y'know what?
I can't wait to see your sister

20:24.900 --> 20:26.900
She looks real beautiful man

20:28.200 --> 20:30.700
I know
but she's still my sister okay...

20:31.100 --> 20:33.500
I know, I know, I'm only saying...
I'm not blind, she's gorgeous.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.400
Fuck off

20:38.900 --> 20:40.100
- Taxi

20:42.500 --> 20:45.900
You should look after her
What are you talking about?

20:46.500 --> 20:48.000
Your turning into a dealer

20:48.500 --> 20:51.100
- I'm not turning into a dealer
- Yes you are, what we going to do tonight?

20:52.300 --> 20:54.500
You know...

20:54.900 --> 20:56.800
look what your sisters doing,
you know...

20:57.200 --> 21:00.000
she' trying to stop you
from doing that...

21:00.100 --> 21:01.500
Are you schizophrenic?!

21:01.800 --> 21:03.700
- your the one who introduced me to your provider
- Ah, c'mon.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.100
Honestly, you should try to get a job
you know...

21:08.700 --> 21:09.700
I don't know

21:10.200 --> 21:13.800
I mean, your a smart guy,
you know... Good dj

21:15.000 --> 21:17.300
Maybe ask the club to get you a job
part time, like bartending...

21:17.700 --> 21:19.600
its really fucking easy I did it

21:20.100 --> 21:22.000
piece of cake... Especially in Tokyo

21:23.100 --> 21:24.800
Your a foreigner, your good looking...

21:28.700 --> 21:30.900
You know, theres a big difference -

21:31.200 --> 21:33.900
between taking psychedelics
and being a dealer, you know?

21:34.100 --> 21:35.500
I said I'm not a dealer!

21:35.800 --> 21:39.500
You're a dealer
and you're a mother fucker, man

21:40.400 --> 21:43.100
I can't believe
your fucking that old bitch

21:43.400 --> 21:45.500
You're in Tokyo, theres a lot
of fucking cute chicks everywhere,

21:45.600 --> 21:47.600
and your fucking some old bitch,
and she's a foreigner as well...

21:47.900 --> 21:49.800
at least if your fucking a Japanese...

21:50.200 --> 21:53.200
- old bitch, you know...
- She fucked me

21:53.500 --> 21:55.400
Anyway... Oh man... Police!

21:55.900 --> 21:57.900
Fuck!

21:58.300 --> 21:59.200
Hey um...

22:04.200 --> 22:06.100
I want to dump my bottle...

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
- Have you heard of Datura?
- No

22:10.900 --> 22:12.800
Its crazy shit!

22:13.000 --> 22:14.900
- Whats Datura? Is it a mushroom?
- Yeah,... its a plant

22:15.600 --> 22:21.700
that takes you somewhere, you know
quite freaky...

22:22.300 --> 22:24.200
Whats it... Whats it like...? I mean,

22:25.200 --> 22:27.200
Whats the trip like on Datura?

22:31.400 --> 22:34.300
Ah... like... you don't even know your
fucking tripping, you know...

22:35.200 --> 22:38.900
You'll be on the floor,
talking to every-fucking-body...

22:39.300 --> 22:41.200
but you realise
two weeks later...

22:41.500 --> 22:43.600
you were not talking to anybody,
you know what...

22:44.000 --> 22:46.900
I took it, I saw that chick
man she was gorgeous

22:47.100 --> 22:49.100
...hang on a sec, hang on,
she was fucking gorgeous

22:49.400 --> 22:50.000
I really fucking like her, right...

22:50.500 --> 22:52.400
And I tried to kiss her,
been talking for 30 minutes

22:56.500 --> 22:58.400
tried to kiss her, she fuckin'
disappeared, she never existed!

22:58.900 --> 23:00.900
THE VOID

23:02.200 --> 23:03.400
I don't want to see you doing
that shit with Victor right, so...

23:03.400 --> 23:06.600
I wait for you at Express on food
and I see you in a minute

23:07.000 --> 23:08.900
- Okay
- Right, I catch you in a minute man.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.100
Yeah, see you later

23:17.600 --> 23:20.900
Linda's right,
Alex is way more of a junkie than me.

23:25.700 --> 23:27.200
Hope Victor's here already

23:28.200 --> 23:29.800
I don't want to wait for him

23:48.100 --> 23:50.500
I got your stuff.

23:53.100 --> 23:54.200
I'm sorry.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.600
- What?
- I'm sorry

23:57.600 --> 23:59.100
Police!
Shit!

24:05.500 --> 24:08.100
Police! Open up!

24:17.300 --> 24:20.200
What are you doing!?
I'm gonna call my embassy!

24:23.900 --> 24:25.800
Hold on, hold on a minute!

24:30.400 --> 24:31.700

24:45.600 --> 24:48.200
I have a gun!

24:49.700 --> 24:51.100
If you don't leave I'll shoot!

24:52.900 --> 24:54.600
What do you want me to...

25:00.600 --> 25:04.500
What...? They shot me...

25:10.400 --> 25:12.000
They shot me...

25:12.500 --> 25:14.300
Did they kill me?
Did they shoot me?

25:19.100 --> 25:21.700
I don't want to die like this...

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
I need help

25:25.800 --> 25:27.200
I have a sister

25:27.800 --> 25:29.700
Thats blood on my hands

25:30.000 --> 25:31.700
Is that blood?

25:32.000 --> 25:35.300
Maybe I'm in prison
they've caught me

25:35.800 --> 25:37.400
Its the police, isn't it

25:42.900 --> 25:44.800
Didn't do anyone harm...

25:45.200 --> 25:46.800
...or hurt anyone.
Life sucks

25:54.100 --> 25:55.700
I can't feel my arms

25:58.000 --> 25:59.700
This is not happening
Just tripping... tripping

26:00.300 --> 26:02.300
But it is...

26:02.600 --> 26:04.600
Its the DMT

26:04.900 --> 26:06.900
Who knows?

26:10.500 --> 26:13.100
I'm dying

26:13.400 --> 26:16.000
Am I dead?

26:16.800 --> 26:19.100
None of this is real

26:19.300 --> 26:20.600
I'm floating

26:26.100 --> 26:28.500
What'll happen to her?

38:24.700 --> 38:26.300
I don't know what happened

38:26.800 --> 38:28.400

38:29.200 --> 38:32.100

You should run...

39:22.700 --> 39:26.000

44:16.100 --> 44:18.100
He was bringing some shit to Victor

44:18.400 --> 44:20.000
I heard the shot

44:20.400 --> 44:22.300

44:22.400 --> 44:24.400
You should run there to find out

Do you remember that pact we made?

49:12.500 --> 49:13.600
Kind of

49:23.000 --> 49:25.500
We promised
to never leave each other

49:30.000 --> 49:31.500
Never ever?

49:33.400 --> 49:34.700
Never ever.

49:35.500 --> 49:37.400
- Do you swear?
- I swear

49:38.000 --> 49:39.900
- And if you die?
- I'll come back

49:48.700 --> 49:50.100
This is a blood pact

50:06.400 --> 50:08.800
Now we'll always be together

50:33.100 --> 50:35.300
Stop it! I'm not going you bitch!

50:42.200 --> 50:44.100

50:45.700 --> 50:50.300
You promised me!
Oscar, you promised me!

50:50.700 --> 50:52.100
No! No! No! No!

51:03.700 --> 51:08.800
And she was sent to a foster home, I was sent
to a different one, life became like a nightmare

51:11.900 --> 51:13.800
You should bring her to Tokyo

51:14.300 --> 51:17.400
I miss her so much...
She's younger, and she's still in school

51:17.700 --> 51:19.400

51:24.700 --> 51:26.600

51:42.900 --> 51:46.500

51:53.900 --> 51:56.700

51:57.000 --> 51:58.900

52:04.800 --> 52:09.400

I can think of, I'd rather be a drug dealer

52:10.300 --> 52:12.200
No man, thats fucking dangerous, you know

52:13.000 --> 52:14.100
Shitty job

52:14.500 --> 52:17.000
Good drugs are nice here but...

52:17.800 --> 52:20.300
you can go like
really deep into the shit, you know

52:20.900 --> 52:22.800
You can end up in prison...

52:24.200 --> 52:27.000
My mums the same when she was young.
To make money she was a go-go dancer

52:27.300 --> 52:29.300
- Really?
- Yeah!

52:29.600 --> 52:31.600
She's an amazing woman...
You should come and meet her

52:31.800 --> 52:32.800
Yeah

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
Come out for dinner

52:37.100 --> 52:39.500
When I met her,
she was a go-go dancer in Tokyo.

52:39.800 --> 52:43.100
Yeah, I went down to the club a few times...
Got a disease...

52:43.600 --> 52:45.500
Anyway! Anyway!

52:45.800 --> 52:47.900

52:52.800 --> 52:55.300
No, no,
my parents passed away a long time ago

52:57.000 --> 52:58.500
What happened?

53:01.400 --> 53:03.900
If you want, I can find
the money to lend you. How about it?

53:07.000 --> 53:09.200
You don't have alot
of friends in Tokyo, right?

53:15.800 --> 53:16.900
And Victor?

53:18.100 --> 53:19.200
What about Victor?

53:30.700 --> 53:32.600
- Nobody knows I'm here, right?
- Nobody

54:08.900 --> 54:10.500
Hey, thats beautiful

54:14.500 --> 54:16.700
- You know what this reminds me
- What?

54:17.700 --> 54:19.300
Smoking...

54:19.900 --> 54:21.500
It reminds me of sucking
on my mothers nipples

54:22.600 --> 54:25.700
Best thing in my life, yeah

54:26.200 --> 54:29.400
Freak... When is this acid
gonna be hitting me?

54:39.000 --> 54:41.500
You know the good thing about LSD

54:41.900 --> 54:43.800
you can manage to overcome your fears

54:44.100 --> 54:46.700
he can take you to other stations
wherever you want...

55:14.700 --> 55:17.000
Ma, what happens if you die

55:17.400 --> 55:19.000

55:25.700 --> 55:28.200

55:34.400 --> 55:35.700
No, I love you both

55:37.500 --> 55:39.500
But its a different love,
a very different love

55:42.100 --> 55:43.200
Mom... mom

56:26.600 --> 56:28.600
Hey, hey!

57:09.600 --> 57:12.100
Yeah? So you like alcohol
then you like drugs

57:12.400 --> 57:13.700
It's like one step, then the next step

57:14.100 --> 57:15.500
One step, yeah!

57:15.800 --> 57:18.200

57:18.600 --> 57:22.500
Some of my friends said I can come back here

57:22.700 --> 57:24.400
Who's that,
who's your friend?

57:24.800 --> 57:26.100
It doesn't matter

57:26.400 --> 57:28.300
It always does matter, who's your friend?

57:28.600 --> 57:29.900
Gaspar

57:30.900 --> 57:33.000
Alright, thank you...

59:49.800 --> 59:51.700
Not a chance, guys' so paranoid

59:52.600 --> 59:54.400
Do you have the money though?

59:57.000 --> 59:58.100
Here you go

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:03.700
The drug guy

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:06.100
Yeah, he likes boys

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:09.300
- Who is this?
- Bruno, the guy that gave me drugs

01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:13.700
Don't even take a drink, you might wake up
two days later with shit in your mouth...

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.500
Or your own shit, you know

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:29.500
I should be able to get him to see you today but
I won't come back with you so you should be careful...

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:32.200
You know what his new trick is?

01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:35.700
He can't even be turned on by fucking now
So what he does is...

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:39.600
Hey, I'm not gonna
jump from here am I?

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:44.200
Hey, once a new guy
gave him a blowjob, yeah...

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:51.300
He sticks his finger inside his own ass and then
wipes his finger on the back of their head

01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:53.600
So they walk around
with shit on their hair

01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:57.600
Thats the guy I was telling you about

01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:59.500
Hey, you look just like me...

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:02.000
- Whats your name
- Oscar

01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:06.900
- So what do you want?
- Do you have any LSD?

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.500
Lets have a look...

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:18.900
Good, Oscar, check this

01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:25.100
What happened to him?

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:28.900
Poor baby,
screaming for his mum all night

01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:33.100
Yeah, this is what
I'm looking for...

01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:34.800
Cheers, mate

01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:42.800
- Nice!
- Good shit!

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:45.700
Hey, do you have any DMT?

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:48.600
DMT? I might have a little bit left

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:55.000
You ever tried GHB?

01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:00.200
Its funny you know
DMT only lasts for six minutes...

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.800
But it really seems like eternity

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:08.000
Its the same chemical
that your brain receives when you die

01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:12.900
Its a little bit like... Dying would
be the ultimate trip, you know

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:17.500
Hey, lets try this

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.400
Be careful

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:28.000
You see these tunnels,

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:30.300
it leads to huge gutters

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:33.500
you know, all those bums hiding there...

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:36.700
people go at night in those gutters...

01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:41.600
What do you think?

01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:44.300
- Its fuckin' awesome
- Yeah?

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:47.900
Imagine if like the walls are all clear

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:50.800
and all your friends
are inside, like, fucking

01:02:54.100 --> 01:02:55.100
- Oscar!
- Yeah

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:58.800
Come and check it out,
I have something for you

01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:02.900
I'll show you that
before you try DMT

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Tibetan Book of The dead

01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:06.600
I'm assuming its about death

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:11.100
Well, it tells you how your spirit
comes out from your body after you die

01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:13.300
Have you had a out of body experience?

01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:16.700
- Have you?
- Yeah, once

01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:18.000
Whats that like?

01:03:18.300 --> 01:03:20.400
First - Took me so long to get there

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:22.600
had to practice,

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.600
slowing down my breathing
slowing down, slowing down...

01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:30.900
Its like my mind is out,
and I can see myself, just above myself...

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:34.500
I really freaked out because

01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:37.400
I would not be able to get back in my body

01:03:37.900 --> 01:03:40.700
Yeah its fuckin' crazy, you know
Yeah its cool, you know

01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:43.900

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:45.700

01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:50.800
Don't forget I'll be arriving at the airport

01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:52.900
Monday evening at six pm...

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:54.200
and you will be there, won't you...

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:00.900

01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:42.200

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:10.400
When you and grandpa die
what will happen to us?

01:06:11.900 --> 01:06:13.500
You'll be taken care of dear

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:15.700
We promise, you'll be taken care of

01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:20.100
No! No! No!

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:25.500

01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:28.900

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:31.600

01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:37.400
You know what?
I dreamt again of the accident

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:50.100
Yeah, well it doesn't matter, we're going
to be like a family from now on. Just you and me.

01:06:58.300 --> 01:06:59.800
Do you want some more?

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.200
Was it good?

01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:15.700

01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:41.200

01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:19.000
You gotta take care of her

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:24.800

01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:37.899
She likes me...

01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:15.300
Hi heres the deal, you float me the
money for the deal

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:18.500
I take the risk scoring and selling stuff,
we go for a 50/50 split and we split all the profit

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.899
I can't wait! Who's your dealer?

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:23.700
Thats none of your business

01:09:24.399 --> 01:09:27.000

01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:32.000
Look, where were you?

01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:37.100
I was looking for you...

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:39.700
That guy got you way too drunk

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.300

01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:08.400
Let go of me!

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:34.200
I'm having fun

01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:50.000

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:18.800
- You promise me you'll never leave me?
- Of course

01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:24.000

- Never die

01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:26.900
- We'll never die?

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:29.200

- Yes

01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:31.900
- We will never die
- Good

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:40.700

01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:29.600
I don't have a mental age of 5 anymore

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:42.000
Don't you want to find a real job?

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:46.500
Fuck no!
Everybody who has a job is just a slave

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:53.200
There's one important thing though,
its to have a goal

01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:55.600
Like... Do you have a goal?

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:03.900
I don't know

01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:07.800
- You should have a goal
- Maybe like have a big love affair?

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:13.600
Hey what did that guy want
with you in the nightclub?

01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:20.000
- He offered me a job
- Doing what?

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:41.700

Don't be a bad brother

01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:00.000
So how much do you owe him?

01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:04.000

- Do you know what Mum and Dad said?
- What?

01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:22.700
That they would bring us to Japan one day

01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:25.700

01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:13.400

Where the fuck were you?
You didn't come home last night, you didn't call me

01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:26.900
You can let me know the next time

01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:29.700
If you mean Mario, I wasn't with him

01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:48.800
What?

01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:53.900
Are you jealous?

01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:16.800

01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:37.600
Victor didn't come home last night
Do you know where he is?

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:38.900
No

01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:41.900
Will you call me

01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:56.300
What you dreaming about Oscar?

01:23:56.900 --> 01:23:58.800
Do you remember that pact we made?

01:24:02.700 --> 01:24:04.400
Mmm, kind of

01:24:12.400 --> 01:24:14.800
We promised to never leave each other

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.400
No matter what

01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:23.600
Never ever?

01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:27.600
Never ever.

01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:44.700
I got into a fight with Victor last night

01:24:51.800 --> 01:24:53.500
Do you want a trip?

01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:57.600
You sick?

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:19.800
Linda...

01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:31.700
I wonder what Tokyo
looks like from up there?

01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:38.200
I don't...

01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:42.400
Why not?

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.900
I'd be scared

01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:49.900
Scared of what?

01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:52.600
Of dying

01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:43.700
- Huh?
- Oscar its Victor

01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:54.700

01:26:55.300 --> 01:26:57.300
- Wanna come?
- Sure

01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:06.400
Have you read The Book of The Dead?

01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:30.200
I'm sorry

01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:39.800
Don't worry I'm burning his stash now

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:42.600
Yeah, everything. Gone.

01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:52.200
The fucking assholes,
first they said he had a gun

01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:56.000
and now they won't even
take a fuckin' autopsy

01:35:59.900 --> 01:36:01.700
I can't believe this is real...

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:05.200
Fuck

01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:46.600
But why is he still here?

01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:40.700
Your Alex's friend, right?
Tell us about him.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:44.500
I'm asking you say something!

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.700
- I don't know anything
- Yes you do, don't lie

01:37:46.900 --> 01:37:49.000
I can smell when people lie

01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:53.200
And if you can help us,
we can help you out

01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:56.200
We can help you
to get out of this situation

01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:58.500
If you don't, you go to jail

01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:02.500
And you don't want to go there,
so tell us about your friend Alex

01:38:03.300 --> 01:38:04.900
We know that, he knows the main supplier

01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:07.900
Say something!

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.900
What did he say? They say
Linda's brother had a dangerous friend

01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:45.700
Who attacked one of the officers...
And they want us to let them know any information

01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:56.500
Its in Japanese, I can't read it

01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:00.300
C'mon, I can do it for you

01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:00.100
It's positive isn't it

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.500
Yes, it's positive

01:45:22.900 --> 01:45:24.400
- You alright?
- Oh, man

01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:33.300
You're sweating alot... So, you mean
I can't get any coke from you

01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:36.300
No. I got rid of my entire stash

01:45:36.900 --> 01:45:40.800
How do I know Oscar didn't
give my name to that slime bag Victor

01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:06.500
- No it is your fault!
- Who made the call?

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:08.600
I didn't call the police!

01:46:08.700 --> 01:46:10.700
You called them!
You called them!

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:12.300
Get the fuck off me!

01:46:12.500 --> 01:46:14.000
Hey we're a family here!

01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:15.600
Stop it, just stop it!

01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:18.700
My mothers a bitch!

01:46:19.300 --> 01:46:20.900
Don't talk to your mother like this!

01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:22.400
She fucked my friend!

01:46:22.700 --> 01:46:25.400
And you think you can play man of the house?!

01:46:25.700 --> 01:46:27.900
- I'm the man of this house!
- You are not the man of this house!

01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:31.200
Now get out. Get out!

01:46:37.900 --> 01:46:39.900
- What are you doing?
- What do you think you're doing?

01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:42.800
- I despise you
- I fucking despise you, I fucking hate you!

01:49:21.100 --> 01:49:24.600
Don't you see she's just using you?

01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:29.100
No. Thats not the point.

01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:33.000
It's just that I like Linda

01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:41.400
She even want to have a baby with me...

01:50:00.300 --> 01:50:01.300
- Hi
- Hey

01:50:06.500 --> 01:50:08.500
Hey, are you okay?

01:53:43.500 --> 01:53:45.700
No man I'm not okay, I'm in deep shit

01:53:46.100 --> 01:53:48.000
Look can you do me a big favour

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.400
Can you go to my place and
speak to my roommate

01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:55.800
Yeah, I need some money

01:53:58.100 --> 01:53:59.500
Yeah, he knows where it is

01:54:02.100 --> 01:54:05.900
And I need a jacket as well, I'm freezing

01:54:16.700 --> 01:54:21.200
Don't call him, you go to my place

01:54:22.300 --> 01:54:24.700
I'm sure the police are tapping our phones

01:54:31.300 --> 01:54:34.900
Okay, okay I'll call you later
and give you a place for the meeting

01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:39.000
Alright, alright cheers. Ciao.

01:55:56.900 --> 01:55:58.400
Mario is just a good fuck

01:56:03.100 --> 01:56:04.600
I should have listened to my brother...

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:10.600
I should have been with Alex...

01:56:15.100 --> 01:56:16.500
He really likes him

01:56:20.300 --> 01:56:21.900
What did he say?

01:56:25.900 --> 01:56:30.400
- He's okay
- Thats all we can say...

02:00:09.800 --> 02:00:11.600
Why did you bring me here?

02:00:15.700 --> 02:00:18.200
The manager isn't happy with your dance,

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.300
we can't keep you any more

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
but what am I gonna do?

02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:36.700
I am not your Daddy,
but I could take care of you

02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:44.400
are you asleep?

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.500
I would have already committed suicide

02:00:55.900 --> 02:00:58.800
if I didn't have this sensation...
that Oscar is somewhere around me...

02:01:00.900 --> 02:01:03.200
I wish he could come back to life...

02:01:09.700 --> 02:01:11.600
Stop hurting yourself

02:01:13.800 --> 02:01:15.900
I know its hard to lament

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
But dead... is dead

02:03:04.300 --> 02:03:06.400
Please let us know if he gets his speech back

02:03:35.300 --> 02:03:37.000
That thing is not my brother...

02:03:41.300 --> 02:03:43.000
He's obviously not like how he was...

02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:48.400
- That thing is fucking disgusting...
- Shut up!

02:03:53.100 --> 02:03:55.500
Have you two decided where we going?

02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:03.700
Have you two decided,
where the fuck we going?!

02:04:07.500 --> 02:04:09.400
Theres...
theres no way I could put up with him

02:04:21.300 --> 02:04:22.500
Don't fucking touch me!

02:04:33.300 --> 02:04:34.700
Lets get the fuck outta here

02:04:45.700 --> 02:04:46.900
Hey, wake up!

02:04:49.400 --> 02:04:50.900
Hey, hey wake!

02:06:50.700 --> 02:06:52.200
They burnt you didn't they?

02:06:54.700 --> 02:06:56.600
They burnt you didn't they?

02:06:59.700 --> 02:07:01.300
They torched you!

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:12.700
They torched you, c'mon think about it
Close your eyes and think about it

02:07:13.500 --> 02:07:15.400
If your lucky you might find your ashes

02:07:15.900 --> 02:07:17.300
Go on you little cunt!

02:07:19.800 --> 02:07:23.400
Go on! Close your eyes think about it!
Go on!

02:08:02.300 --> 02:08:03.800
- I ah...
- What?

02:08:07.200 --> 02:08:11.400
I had another dream where my brother
resuscitated from the morgue

02:08:22.300 --> 02:08:25.100
Isn't it creepy keeping his remains in that box

02:08:28.600 --> 02:08:30.600
What you gonna do?

02:08:31.700 --> 02:08:33.100
It's your fucking brother!

02:08:48.900 --> 02:08:51.600
Those remains are not my brother

02:08:54.900 --> 02:08:56.600
Do, what you want

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:21.400
Goodbye...

02:11:17.700 --> 02:11:19.600
- Here you are!
- Thank you man!

02:11:19.900 --> 02:11:21.100
- Are you okay?
- Oh...

02:11:21.500 --> 02:11:23.800
- Shit...
- Thanks, you got cigarettes?

02:11:40.300 --> 02:11:42.100
Okay I'm gonna need some money

02:11:42.400 --> 02:11:44.000
Okay I ask Linda to bring it to you

02:11:44.300 --> 02:11:46.300
She want to see you

02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:47.900
- Yeah?
- Yeah

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.700
- Is she still with Mario?
- Yeah I think...

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:53.000
Fuck

02:12:52.300 --> 02:12:53.800
What do you want?

02:13:00.400 --> 02:13:02.400
I want to say sorry

02:13:05.500 --> 02:13:07.700
I want to say sorry, sorry

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:13.400
Thats what you keep hearing
the others saying?

02:13:15.900 --> 02:13:17.800
- That your sorry?
- Yes - Really? - Yes

02:13:24.200 --> 02:13:27.100
Why don't you go make yourself useful

02:13:27.700 --> 02:13:29.400
and go kill yourself...

02:13:33.500 --> 02:13:36.100
Yeah, why don't you go and make yourself useful

02:13:36.500 --> 02:13:40.700
- and fucking go kill yourself
- You don't mean that

02:13:41.500 --> 02:13:42.600
I do

02:13:42.900 --> 02:13:49.700
You don't understand...
I mean It's partly my fault

02:13:50.100 --> 02:13:53.700
From me and Oscar...
Go fucking kill yourself...

02:13:55.300 --> 02:13:57.200
- You have to understand...
- You piece of SHIT!

02:13:57.700 --> 02:14:02.800
Yeah but Oscar died dealing drugs because
you went with all these sleazy people

02:14:03.500 --> 02:14:06.900
Because its me, because its my fucking fault?

02:14:07.300 --> 02:14:08.600
- You piece of shit!
- Get the fuck outta here!

02:14:08.700 --> 02:14:09.900

02:15:38.800 --> 02:15:40.700
I don't wanna be here

02:15:46.800 --> 02:15:48.700
