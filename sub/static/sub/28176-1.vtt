02:41.101 --> 02:43.922
Be careful, my friend.

02:44.089 --> 02:46.175
You too, my brother.

03:21.007 --> 03:22.334
Out of the way!

03:48.608 --> 03:50.208
Martin Luther!

04:06.336 --> 04:09.987
STORM - LETTERS OF FIRE

04:40.785 --> 04:42.491
The village ...

04:42.662 --> 04:47.842
was at the top of the hill.

05:05.361 --> 05:07.352
-Good morning sir.
-Good Morning.

05:07.517 --> 05:10.444
-Can you print this?
-Of course.

05:27.679 --> 05:30.678
I'll have it ready next week.

05:30.842 --> 05:32.406
Thank you.

05:37.621 --> 05:39.055
That's not good.

05:41.340 --> 05:43.050
I had set up the whole page.

05:43.051 --> 05:45.134
Those letters are now unusable.

05:45.303 --> 05:46.109
I'll fix it.

05:46.310 --> 05:49.381
No, I'll do it tonight.
You can clean up and go home.

05:53.159 --> 05:56.289
- Alwin.
- Klaas.

05:56.461 --> 05:57.576
Look at this.

05:59.695 --> 06:00.773
But this is forbidden.

06:01.675 --> 06:03.110
Yes, but someone has to do it.

06:03.935 --> 06:06.092
I told you to clean up your mess.

06:06.264 --> 06:08.386
Storm, my old friend.

06:08.767 --> 06:13.402
I couldn't wait any longer, Klaas,
This curiosity eats away at me.

06:13.564 --> 06:15.164
Here it is.

06:17.388 --> 06:18.715
Well?

06:19.925 --> 06:21.466
POEMS 
Alwin Danker

06:21.629 --> 06:23.447
Klaas Voeten. You really are ...

06:23.448 --> 06:26.573
one of the best printers in this city.

06:26.739 --> 06:28.624
Thank you my friend.

06:28.789 --> 06:32.203
Did you help your father?
Then I should thank you too, Storm.

06:32.370 --> 06:36.377
No, thank Herman, he does all the hard work.

06:36.577 --> 06:37.309
Alwin?

06:37.376 --> 06:41.691
Assembly, printing, binding ...
just 50 copies of your book ...

06:42.068 --> 06:44.510
Is two weeks of work.

06:45.649 --> 06:48.576
I'm not working, Klaas.
I have no money, I'm sorry

06:48.743 --> 06:51.813
Yes, but I can't live on air and love.
I have a family.

06:51.976 --> 06:55.011
The recording of words,
phrases, language ...

06:55.174 --> 06:59.109
printed text ... is a wonder for all of us,

06:59.276 --> 07:01.504
the network of words
seen and heard by all

07:01.882 --> 07:04.431
is like a light that pierces the darkness.

07:04.594 --> 07:08.566
This little volume should make me
the most famous poet in Antwerp.

07:08.731 --> 07:11.766
I'll pay you back the money
owed with interest.

07:58.857 --> 08:02.306
Go on, throw them into the fire!

08:02.473 --> 08:05.603
No, no! Not my books!

08:08.138 --> 08:10.580
Throw everything in.

08:10.746 --> 08:12.073
Father!

08:15.334 --> 08:16.875
No!

08:20.306 --> 08:21.705
No, not that.

08:23.434 --> 08:24.761
Not that one.

08:26.459 --> 08:30.109
Father, no! Don't do it, Papa.

08:58.265 --> 08:59.735
Father?

08:59.899 --> 09:02.236
In the Market Square ...

09:02.237 --> 09:04.321
They burned Gillis' books.

09:25.970 --> 09:27.440
APPOINTED THE INQUISITOR:
Frans Van der Hulst

09:27.743 --> 09:30.291
They appointed Van der Hulst.

09:31.532 --> 09:33.654
What is an Inquisitor?

09:34.695 --> 09:39.745
It's ... an inquisitor is someone 
who conducts an investigation.

09:41.613 --> 09:45.512
I think I saw him in front of Gillis' house.

09:48.739 --> 09:50.801
What does he investigate?

09:50.964 --> 09:54.484
He investigates whether or not people
are good Catholics.

09:54.823 --> 09:56.908
And the printer Gillis is not?

09:58.020 --> 10:00.047
Of course he is.

10:00.210 --> 10:03.896
But they burned his books.
Why are they forbidden?

10:04.243 --> 10:06.234
How should I know, Storm?

10:08.588 --> 10:12.523
- Do you print forbidden books?
- Of course not.

10:20.859 --> 10:25.624
Mother, they burned all of Gillis the
printer's books.

10:25.850 --> 10:29.150
It was ordered by the new inquisitor.
His hands were also burned.

10:29.350 --> 10:32.600
How awful, my dear.

10:33.651 --> 10:35.986
Storm, set the table.

10:37.788 --> 10:42.695
What is this city coming to?
All these valuable books ...

10:42.863 --> 10:45.127
They must have good reason.

10:47.382 --> 10:51.697
- Burning books is the real crime.
- Not if the content offends God.

10:52.075 --> 10:56.212
- I'm sure that God ...
- You do not know the mind of God.

11:05.979 --> 11:08.208
Our Father, Who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy Name,

11:08.379 --> 11:11.934
thy kingdom come, thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

11:12.098 --> 11:14.741
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses,

11:15.087 --> 11:17.245
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

11:17.416 --> 11:21.767
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

11:44.773 --> 11:46.623
No, no!

12:13.939 --> 12:20.162
Lord, we are gathered here in thy presence

12:20.370 --> 12:23.120
to worship thy name,
oh sole and sovereign God.

12:23.324 --> 12:26.596
Grant us wisdom, peace and piety.

12:27.148 --> 12:32.399
And may the Lord forgive our transgressions. Amen.

12:32.850 --> 12:33.893
Stop it.

12:41.227 --> 12:43.562
Give generously ...

12:44.634 --> 12:50.885
for the construction of the second tower
of the Cathedral of Our Lady.

13:09.766 --> 13:13.417
Have your sins erased and your
time in Purgatory shortened.

13:13.590 --> 13:17.276
Purchase a plenary indulgence
signed by the Pope himself.

13:18.387 --> 13:22.700
- Storm, how are you?
- I have not seen you in a long time.

13:22.941 --> 13:26.876
He is helping his father in the
print shop. Everyday.

13:28.086 --> 13:31.677
Have your sins forgiven.
Shorten your time in Purgatory.

13:31.840 --> 13:35.076
Signed by His
Holiness the Pope of Rome.

13:35.247 --> 13:37.202
Plenary Indulgences for sale.

13:38.862 --> 13:41.540
- We're going home.
- I want an Indulgence.

13:41.921 --> 13:46.058
- They are very expensive.
- Then Beatrice can go to heaven.

13:47.239 --> 13:50.369
- See? Claar is buying one.
- We are not. Let's go.

13:50.542 --> 13:52.426
Storm, come ...

13:56.833 --> 13:59.026
We have delicious apples!

13:59.197 --> 14:01.046
Fresh grapes, red and white!

14:01.214 --> 14:02.755
Wait here.

14:06.463 --> 14:08.976
Do you want apples, ma'am?

14:09.139 --> 14:11.368
Hey, you little brat. Stop, thief!

14:11.537 --> 14:14.323
Stop him! Stop that thief!

14:15.570 --> 14:17.111
Don't run away.

14:19.011 --> 14:21.097
- Stop!
- What's going on?

14:21.271 --> 14:24.685
- He picked up an apple.
- He stole an apple.

14:24.852 --> 14:27.012
Klaas? It is an outrage,

14:27.013 --> 14:30.139
the prices they dare to
ask for those indulgences.

14:30.309 --> 14:32.540
Martin Luther wants to abolish them.

14:32.541 --> 14:34.625
All they do is to make the rich richer.

14:34.794 --> 14:38.658
- What about the rest of us, the people?
- Let's go home.

14:42.406 --> 14:45.997
Come on, hurry up. Cecilia?

14:51.375 --> 14:56.010
Lord, please, a penny. I beg you.

15:03.229 --> 15:07.615
-You're not being reasonable.
-I don't want my sister to suffer.

15:07.783 --> 15:11.754
Beatrice was a good woman and surely
she is already in heaven ...

15:11.919 --> 15:16.234
... without us buying indulgences.
-She'd do the same for us.

15:16.404 --> 15:21.583
Do you really think that she'll get out of
Purgatory faster just because you pay the Church?

15:21.965 --> 15:26.836
-Do you want her to stay there forever?
-No, but we cannot afford it.

15:27.179 --> 15:31.873
Maybe you should stop printing for
false friends who will not pay you.

15:32.046 --> 15:36.704
I don't understand you. Alwin has
had a bad influence on you.

15:36.878 --> 15:38.692
That's ridiculous.

15:40.910 --> 15:42.237
No!

15:44.421 --> 15:49.744
Stop pestering me. These people are
important to me. And Alwin, too.

16:28.325 --> 16:30.245
Storm? Come in.

16:39.101 --> 16:42.589
This book will make me famous.

16:42.590 --> 16:44.673
It will spell the end of poverty for me.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.658
And one day you'll be a successful printer.

16:50.086 --> 16:52.635
Okay then ...

16:54.153 --> 16:56.737
Speak. What's on your mind?

16:58.463 --> 17:00.351
My parents. They are arguing a lot.

17:00.352 --> 17:02.436
About what?

17:02.600 --> 17:04.450
I don't know exactly.

17:05.521 --> 17:10.569
The Church, indulgences.
I think my father is against them.

17:13.516 --> 17:15.958
Your father is absolutely right.

17:20.885 --> 17:23.078
Who is Martin Luther?

17:28.602 --> 17:32.360
A great thinker, who wants to change the Church.

17:41.082 --> 17:42.966
His ideas are in here.

17:44.453 --> 17:46.235
I'll lend it to you.

17:46.236 --> 17:49.361
But it is forbidden,
So don't show it to anyone.

18:00.444 --> 18:02.399
BANS ON THE DOOR BY A CHRISTIAN

18:45.217 --> 18:46.544
Wait.

18:57.140 --> 18:58.646
Very good.

19:11.636 --> 19:14.635
I'll be gone for awhile
Continue helping Herman.

20:27.556 --> 20:30.519
Brothers and sisters ...

20:32.492 --> 20:36.285
Unfortunately, I bring bad news.

20:36.628 --> 20:41.429
Our brother, Martin Luther, was 
arrested and excommunicated.

20:44.241 --> 20:50.492
But this will not stop us from
following his teachings ...

20:50.673 --> 20:53.802
And resisting the cruelty of the Inquisition.

20:53.974 --> 20:56.724
- What are you doing here?
- Nothing.

20:58.563 --> 21:00.033
I just ...

21:00.197 --> 21:02.745
- Go back home.
- Klaas ...

21:05.377 --> 21:10.106
The boy is just curious, Klaas. You should be glad..

21:12.467 --> 21:16.367
Don't breathe a word of this to anyone,
not even your mother.

21:19.698 --> 21:24.120
Guys, here they have the best sandwiches in Antwerp.

21:26.234 --> 21:30.371
The smell of hot bread is like the breath of a young woman.

21:30.718 --> 21:34.368
Her chest rising like freshly kneaded dough.

21:35.619 --> 21:37.125
Follow my lead.

21:43.197 --> 21:45.841
- Am I right?
- Delicious.

21:46.987 --> 21:48.587
Just like a poem.

21:59.987 --> 22:01.730
Where did you get that?

22:06.557 --> 22:09.307
- Did you give it to him?
- What is it?

22:14.587 --> 22:16.745
I found it.

22:18.132 --> 22:19.457
It's blasphemous.

22:19.458 --> 22:22.271
But Luther wrote it so we could think about it.

22:22.443 --> 22:25.194
Don't say that name in my house.

22:26.441 --> 22:29.547
Cecilia, don't worry.
The boy is merely curious.

22:29.708 --> 22:32.185
Is this Alwin's influence?

22:33.810 --> 22:35.967
- Or is it you?
- Cecilia, let it be.

22:50.253 --> 22:53.042
There's only one, true belief, Storm.

22:53.044 --> 22:56.169
Anyone who thinks otherwise is wrong ...

22:56.336 --> 23:00.757
and will call misfortune down
upon himself and his loved ones.

23:03.009 --> 23:04.574
Cecilia!

23:29.881 --> 23:33.259
Emperor Charles the fifth ...

23:33.426 --> 23:37.184
... will soon honor Antwerp with a visit.

23:39.232 --> 23:42.302
The Inquisition will be intensified.

23:44.619 --> 23:47.405
I will enact more severe measures ...

23:48.548 --> 23:50.812
to eradicate heresy once and for all.

23:58.350 --> 24:03.400
I want this city to become
a paragon of virtue and devotion.

24:09.718 --> 24:12.301
Be careful. Very good.

24:12.464 --> 24:14.728
Yes, it's in there good. Well done.

24:22.997 --> 24:26.446
- I'll get it.
- Storm, wait.

24:33.807 --> 24:35.313
Brother.

24:37.909 --> 24:40.067
Can I speak to you privately?

24:42.116 --> 24:43.621
Yes of course.

24:45.001 --> 24:46.292
Back to work.

25:48.858 --> 25:51.193
Herman, you may leave.

25:51.361 --> 25:55.533
Right now? So early?
Why? Did I do something wrong?

25:55.706 --> 25:59.914
No, you do good work. That's
why you deserve a day off.

26:00.086 --> 26:01.591
Thank you.

26:10.306 --> 26:13.057
What are you printing for that man?

26:15.694 --> 26:18.551
Go home. Your mother might need help.

26:18.719 --> 26:21.848
Let me help. This work is much more important.

26:27.861 --> 26:30.788
All right, you can help me.

26:30.955 --> 26:35.376
Tell your mother I have to
finish an important order.

26:35.543 --> 26:37.606
Tell her it has to be finished by tomorrow.

26:37.768 --> 26:39.798
Give her this money to buy

26:39.799 --> 26:41.882
an indulgence for Aunt Beatrice.

26:43.539 --> 26:46.574
And keep her away from the shop.

26:48.857 --> 26:50.185
Yes?

27:11.452 --> 27:13.017
One please.

27:33.422 --> 27:36.551
Dad forgets to eat when
he works so hard.

27:38.114 --> 27:42.915
You're right.
Will you take this to him?

28:23.583 --> 28:25.882
We thought that you might be hungry.

28:26.954 --> 28:29.597
Martin Luther? What manuscript is that?

28:29.770 --> 28:34.121
- Thanks for the nice food, but go home Storm.
- It's forbidden.

28:35.993 --> 28:38.115
Open up in the name of the Inquisition.

28:39.538 --> 28:41.008
Open the door!

28:41.172 --> 28:43.092
Get out of here, Storm.

28:44.196 --> 28:45.796
Storm, you need to leave.

28:45.969 --> 28:47.783
Open it!

28:47.951 --> 28:49.586
Break down the doors. Stand back.

28:51.636 --> 28:53.829
Go home, Storm. Hurry up!

29:14.821 --> 29:16.741
- Where is it?
- Bailiff...

29:24.207 --> 29:30.335
- Where is the type set?
- Those letters have already been archived.

29:30.499 --> 29:33.570
Liar. As if you printed just one copy.

29:37.347 --> 29:38.888
Stop!

29:39.051 --> 29:40.591
Get out of the way.

29:42.666 --> 29:43.993
After the assistant!

30:02.306 --> 30:03.633
Over there.

31:27.959 --> 31:30.294
Mr. Van der Hulst?

31:31.853 --> 31:36.168
We believe the assistant ran away.
with the printing rack for the letter...

31:36.336 --> 31:39.193
This letter must never be printed.

31:43.046 --> 31:44.551
Ever.

32:15.270 --> 32:17.084
POEMS

32:32.476 --> 32:34.112
Where have you been?

32:34.458 --> 32:38.073
There was a raid. The legal authorities.
They arrested father.

32:38.247 --> 32:40.274
Holy Mother of God, No!

32:45.895 --> 32:48.053
Mrs. Voeten, open the door.

32:50.240 --> 32:52.326
Oh no, the bailiff's men.

32:52.499 --> 32:55.178
- What are you doing?
- I have to leave.

32:58.131 --> 33:00.679
Why do you have this rack?

33:00.842 --> 33:04.706
-Open, in the name of the law!
-Where are you going?

33:04.875 --> 33:07.945
- Open in the name of the law.
- Wait.

33:09.150 --> 33:12.529
This will protect you. Be careful.

33:16.312 --> 33:18.789
Open this door immediately!

33:33.206 --> 33:35.268
- Mom?
- Come here.

33:42.660 --> 33:46.773
- Where is your son?
- I sent him on an errand.

33:48.640 --> 33:50.762
Has something happened to him?

34:04.387 --> 34:06.058
Everything will be fine.

34:21.837 --> 34:23.199
Open it!

34:25.417 --> 34:28.452
Alwin Dankers, open the door.

34:49.994 --> 34:51.322
Herman?

34:58.650 --> 35:00.285
Are you in here?

35:03.690 --> 35:05.017
Herman?

35:27.433 --> 35:30.017
Watch where you're going boy!

35:58.718 --> 36:01.789
Get his things. His bag!

36:14.396 --> 36:15.723
Thank you.

36:17.628 --> 36:18.956
No!

38:52.909 --> 38:54.936
I just need the printer' rack.

39:00.557 --> 39:02.335
It's inside.

39:03.407 --> 39:05.363
It's wrapped in cloth.

39:17.103 --> 39:19.687
It's really important.

41:26.347 --> 41:28.090
Can you read letters?

41:38.688 --> 41:40.573
Do you live here alone?

41:43.763 --> 41:45.577
For a long time?

42:00.066 --> 42:01.393
Thank you.

42:05.350 --> 42:08.385
My name is Storm.
Storm Voeten.

42:13.275 --> 42:18.147
My father was arrested
by the authorities last night.

42:18.317 --> 42:22.703
And now they're looking for me.
I can't go home.

42:31.978 --> 42:37.513
- Did you steal this thing for reading?
- No, I'm not a thief.

42:39.034 --> 42:42.969
This rack belongs to my father.
He's a printer.

42:43.136 --> 42:45.435
It's a very important letter.

42:45.604 --> 42:50.689
Our Assistant Printer
was murdered because of this.

42:57.110 --> 42:58.960
I really must leave.

43:02.289 --> 43:04.660
- What do you want from me?
- Nobody can know I live here.

43:04.827 --> 43:07.755
I won't tell anyone, I swear.

43:09.451 --> 43:13.659
Please, I need to get
help for my father.

43:22.869 --> 43:24.612
And where will you go?

43:24.781 --> 43:29.309
To find a friend. He might be 
in the Church of St. Andrew.

43:31.420 --> 43:34.550
I know how to get there. 
Under the ground.

44:11.118 --> 44:12.623
Come.

44:38.580 --> 44:40.879
Sorry to disturb you, sir.

44:50.085 --> 44:54.057
The printer's assistant was
found and interrogated.

44:55.265 --> 44:58.715
He offered some resistance.

44:58.880 --> 45:01.702
So we eliminated him.

45:03.852 --> 45:05.452
And the print rack?

45:27.455 --> 45:30.940
He also has a son, Storm Voeten.
Perhaps he has ...

45:31.105 --> 45:33.298
What are you waiting for?

45:33.642 --> 45:37.293
Find him and eradicate
this nest of heretics.

45:43.515 --> 45:44.842
Where are we?

46:10.803 --> 46:14.489
- Aren't we going to St. Andrew's Church?
- Later.

46:15.843 --> 46:20.928
I'm not going in there. This is the 
church that ordered the arrest of my father.

46:21.092 --> 46:23.177
And the murder of Herman.

46:26.828 --> 46:29.234
Hey! Girl!

46:47.372 --> 46:49.257
He gave it to me.

46:49.423 --> 46:54.330
Well, I took it, to be honest.
He wants me to take him to St. Andrews.

46:54.498 --> 46:59.583
And he's got this letter thing
with him. He knows how to read.

47:25.818 --> 47:29.268
Do you always steal candles from the church?

47:29.433 --> 47:34.091
Yes. And next time I come, Mary will have new ones.

47:34.265 --> 47:38.995
- She always helps everyone.
- Why didn't she help my father?

47:40.036 --> 47:42.478
Do you still want to go to St. Andrews?

48:09.270 --> 48:13.443
Aren't you afraid of Purgatory,
with all your stealing?

48:14.554 --> 48:17.684
Or do you also steal
money for indulgences?

48:19.004 --> 48:20.509
No.

48:25.991 --> 48:30.342
The market is up there. We're close to my mother.

48:34.264 --> 48:38.128
- Where's your mother, anyway?
- Dead.

48:40.105 --> 48:42.476
- What about your father?
- Alive.

48:43.650 --> 48:46.886
- Why doesn't he take care of you?
- Because he cannot.

48:48.099 --> 48:50.162
My father is a sailor.

48:51.368 --> 48:54.674
When he returns, he's going to have a lot of money.

48:54.843 --> 48:58.222
He will buy a house where we'll live together.

49:38.122 --> 49:39.627
Girls.

49:49.071 --> 49:50.577
Cecilia ...

49:52.478 --> 49:55.441
Do you have news from Klaas?

49:55.607 --> 49:58.743
He's in jail awaiting trial.

49:58.744 --> 50:01.973
They won't tell me where they're keeping him.

50:02.142 --> 50:04.928
All the printers are talking about it.

50:08.851 --> 50:10.286
Where's Storm?

50:14.100 --> 50:16.293
I don't know. He's gone away.

50:16.464 --> 50:18.384
Gone away? What do you mean?

50:19.696 --> 50:21.237
Tell me.

50:30.091 --> 50:34.927
He has a rack with type set.
The authorities are looking for him.

50:37.355 --> 50:40.591
He must have thrown it away.
Storm is not crazy.

50:40.936 --> 50:42.642
No, but he's stubborn.

50:54.250 --> 50:55.815
Can you make it?

51:11.248 --> 51:13.548
It's over there.

51:13.716 --> 51:15.604
Can't you take me there underground?

51:15.605 --> 51:17.689
No, we can't get any closer.

51:17.853 --> 51:20.926
What if the inquisitor's men are there?

51:20.927 --> 51:23.010
Make sure they do not recognize you.

51:27.239 --> 51:30.475
- Your jacket.
- What about my jacket?

51:30.646 --> 51:32.980
If you give it to me, I will help you.

51:57.134 --> 51:58.461
Here it is.

52:06.381 --> 52:08.989
Well, I have to go.

52:23.413 --> 52:26.484
- You're coming with me?
- Of course.

52:31.826 --> 52:34.469
Act normal. Don't hide your face.

52:59.983 --> 53:03.362
Brother Luther often told me ...

53:03.702 --> 53:09.167
The Bible contains God's own words.
It is sufficient to just read those words.

53:09.334 --> 53:13.756
... And to serve him. It was never his intention for us ...

53:14.097 --> 53:16.468
to worship the bones of the saints.

53:16.634 --> 53:21.755
- What a dreary place...
- Or to worship the Pope of Rome.

53:21.917 --> 53:28.010
Mary was just an ordinary woman
who gave birth to Jesus Christ.

53:28.174 --> 53:31.280
- Who are you looking for?
- Alwin, a friend.

53:31.443 --> 53:36.101
Which is why her statues should
disappear from the churches of our Lord.

53:59.078 --> 54:02.598
Love delights in the righteous
and rejoices with the truth.

54:04.362 --> 54:07.325
It protects us, gives us faith
and hope, and allows us to persevere

54:08.637 --> 54:11.600
Love never ceases where
the prophecies will fail.

54:15.972 --> 54:17.750
Arrest him.

54:21.291 --> 54:23.555
You are disturbing my service.

54:26.540 --> 54:31.755
These meetings are henceforth,
banned under penalty of arrest.

54:31.928 --> 54:33.671
Or worse!

54:35.125 --> 54:38.231
by the order of the Inquisitor General.

54:44.303 --> 54:46.009
Out!

55:15.484 --> 55:16.811
Storm?

55:19.586 --> 55:21.399
What is this?

55:21.567 --> 55:23.037
You!

55:23.410 --> 55:24.667
Stop!

55:24.835 --> 55:26.400
Get him!

55:34.429 --> 55:35.935
Faster.

56:02.134 --> 56:03.462
Stop!

56:05.333 --> 56:06.660
Get out of the way!

56:17.290 --> 56:18.962
Take my hand.

56:24.000 --> 56:25.292
Come on!

56:32.447 --> 56:34.818
They really are looking for you.

56:55.111 --> 56:57.518
The rack for Luther's letter.

56:59.179 --> 57:02.663
I told you. It's gone.

57:02.828 --> 57:05.021
Blown by the wind?

57:07.800 --> 57:09.790
Or a storm, rather?

57:10.962 --> 57:13.085
No sir. I swear to you ...

57:15.968 --> 57:18.166
Sir, I beg you ...

57:18.167 --> 57:21.292
Rest assured that we will find your son.

57:44.056 --> 57:45.727
I saw Storm.

58:06.616 --> 58:11.037
Why did that priest want all
statues removed from the churches?

58:11.205 --> 58:13.291
Because Luther teaches that.

58:14.576 --> 58:15.939
That's stupid.

58:36.408 --> 58:39.193
It's best that you stay here for a while.

58:40.752 --> 58:42.874
No one will find you here.

59:36.093 --> 59:38.250
- Did you steal it?
- No.

59:43.323 --> 59:45.314
It belonged to my mother.

59:45.479 --> 59:47.541
She wrote a sort of of journal for me.

59:52.883 --> 59:54.910
Will you read some of it for me?

01:00:06.197 --> 01:00:09.232
Sunday, November 18, 1514.

01:00:09.394 --> 01:00:11.244
Dear Marieke ...

01:00:14.540 --> 01:00:16.045
Keep going.

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:21.434
Winter has come early. I made the coat
you are now wearing from an old blanket.

01:00:21.596 --> 01:00:26.847
You walk proudly like a peacock.
My brave, beautiful little daughter.

01:00:36.196 --> 01:00:40.309
July 10, 1507.
The most beautiful day of the year.

01:00:40.472 --> 01:00:43.886
A Portuguese ship docked today.

01:00:44.226 --> 01:00:46.312
... with your father on board.

01:00:48.432 --> 01:00:50.352
One year later, I was born.

01:00:50.518 --> 01:00:54.041
My father is the most beautiful
man in Portugal.

01:00:54.042 --> 01:00:56.126
And the best sailor in the world.

01:00:58.513 --> 01:01:01.228
Has he been sailing for a long time?

01:01:02.441 --> 01:01:05.476
Yes, for a long time.

01:01:06.717 --> 01:01:08.222
For years.

01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:13.364
- Why for so long?
- He wants to discover a new world.

01:01:13.530 --> 01:01:15.415
Just like Columbus.

01:01:34.665 --> 01:01:36.586
- What is it?
- Nothing.

01:01:36.751 --> 01:01:40.437
- Why don't you continue?
- I don't want to.

01:01:56.113 --> 01:01:57.440
Please ...

01:01:58.755 --> 01:02:01.233
What it says here ...

01:02:02.961 --> 01:02:05.024
is not nice.

01:02:12.799 --> 01:02:14.364
Are you sure?

01:02:16.554 --> 01:02:18.059
Yes.

01:02:26.252 --> 01:02:28.315
Winter 1516.

01:02:28.476 --> 01:02:31.964
You are eight years old, but still

01:02:31.965 --> 01:02:34.049
so small and vulnerable, my love.

01:02:34.212 --> 01:02:38.041
I should tell you that your father ...

01:02:39.496 --> 01:02:41.974
the love of my life ...

01:02:44.397 --> 01:02:46.388
perished.

01:02:48.082 --> 01:02:50.524
A storm swept him into the sea.

01:02:50.689 --> 01:02:55.810
But I can't speak this horrible truth.
Forgive me ...

01:02:55.972 --> 01:02:59.591
for letting you believe that he's still alive.

01:02:59.592 --> 01:03:01.675
You're lying. It doesn't say that.

01:03:01.847 --> 01:03:04.490
It does. That's what your mother wrote.

01:03:13.319 --> 01:03:16.211
Where are you going? Marieke?

01:03:17.421 --> 01:03:18.891
Marieke, wait.

01:03:28.058 --> 01:03:29.385
Wait.

01:05:08.242 --> 01:05:11.134
Go away. Leave me alone.

01:05:37.442 --> 01:05:39.185
What was his name?

01:05:44.324 --> 01:05:46.315
Alfonso.

01:06:00.245 --> 01:06:02.509
He left on a ship like that.

01:06:04.486 --> 01:06:07.556
My mother and I waved goodbye to him.

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:26.565
This is how you write his name.

01:06:29.097 --> 01:06:30.803
This is the letter A.

01:06:32.156 --> 01:06:34.385
Will you teach me to read?

01:06:42.237 --> 01:06:44.395
Klaas has two a's.

01:07:01.356 --> 01:07:02.992
Mr. Van der Hulst ...

01:07:04.485 --> 01:07:08.243
Brother Proost was interrogated
and he confessed.

01:07:09.629 --> 01:07:15.616
He'll be sentenced to be burned at
the stake in the Market Square in two days.

01:07:17.972 --> 01:07:22.630
My dear Lord, Brother Proost
has a lot of followers in the city.

01:07:22.804 --> 01:07:25.412
This may cause rioting.

01:07:27.984 --> 01:07:30.699
Let's execute a different heretic then.

01:08:00.277 --> 01:08:01.782
B...

01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:07.935
E...

01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:48.642
This is ...

01:08:49.951 --> 01:08:52.986
- a 'V.'
- Yes, very good.

01:08:56.626 --> 01:08:58.475
- And this is ...
- U.

01:08:58.642 --> 01:09:01.462
- Not quite.
- So 'E?'

01:09:01.631 --> 01:09:04.666
That is correct. So what is the whole word?

01:09:06.011 --> 01:09:09.603
- Beloved ...
- Yes, that's right.

01:09:19.569 --> 01:09:22.948
Voeten. Storm Voeten.

01:09:23.113 --> 01:09:24.620
You're right.

01:09:24.783 --> 01:09:26.526
You have ten fingers.

01:09:31.457 --> 01:09:32.926
What are you doing?

01:09:43.448 --> 01:09:45.607
It's floating out to sea.

01:09:47.656 --> 01:09:49.292
To your father.

01:10:53.947 --> 01:10:59.197
Here, his name is on it.
I read it myself. Voeten.

01:11:03.437 --> 01:11:05.808
EXECUTION

01:11:11.537 --> 01:11:12.864
What's wrong?

01:11:15.986 --> 01:11:20.443
My father... tomorrow, in the
Market Square...

01:11:20.783 --> 01:11:23.853
- What?
- He's been condemned to death.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.165
- You must go and see your father.
- Impossible.

01:11:38.511 --> 01:11:40.111
Nothing is impossible.

01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:43.667
Come on, let's go.

01:11:56.135 --> 01:11:57.463
This way.

01:11:59.925 --> 01:12:03.610
- Where are we going?
- I think I know where he is.

01:12:28.916 --> 01:12:30.694
- Wait here.
- Why?

01:12:40.179 --> 01:12:43.450
- What is that?
- This will take us to your father.

01:12:57.698 --> 01:12:59.689
Over there. You see?

01:12:59.854 --> 01:13:01.976
Can I have my ham now?

01:13:02.148 --> 01:13:04.068
Give it to me. Thank you.

01:13:30.583 --> 01:13:33.688
Papa? Klaas Voeten?

01:13:40.490 --> 01:13:42.576
Papa, are you there?

01:13:46.748 --> 01:13:49.983
Klaas? Klaas Voeten?

01:13:50.154 --> 01:13:52.489
Storm? Storm?

01:13:53.421 --> 01:13:55.614
- Papa?
- Storm, I'm here.

01:13:55.959 --> 01:13:57.287
Papa ...

01:14:01.174 --> 01:14:05.489
- Who is she?
- Marieke, she's hiding me.

01:14:05.657 --> 01:14:09.522
- Hiding? Why?
- They're after me, also.

01:14:11.289 --> 01:14:13.352
They killed Herman.

01:14:24.394 --> 01:14:26.422
I'll be out of here soon.

01:14:38.368 --> 01:14:40.359
Papa, you have to escape.

01:14:40.524 --> 01:14:45.159
Marieke will help us.
Papa, how can we get you out?

01:14:45.356 --> 01:14:47.134
It's impossible, Storm.

01:14:47.303 --> 01:14:53.554
Nothing is impossible.
I still have the rack with Luther's letter.

01:14:54.011 --> 01:14:57.176
The rack?
Get rid of it, it's too dangerous.

01:14:57.522 --> 01:14:59.857
- I can use it to save you.
- Don't even think about it.

01:15:00.025 --> 01:15:01.910
The inquisitor absolutely wants to have it.

01:15:03.119 --> 01:15:07.232
You'll never succeed, Storm.
You can't do that.

01:15:07.394 --> 01:15:09.243
Yes I can.

01:15:13.582 --> 01:15:16.783
Storm, it will be alright.

01:15:20.951 --> 01:15:23.144
Go away. Get out of here!

01:15:23.489 --> 01:15:25.125
Get rid of the rack!

01:15:48.796 --> 01:15:50.574
I know I can do this.

01:16:09.583 --> 01:16:11.020
Alwin.

01:16:11.021 --> 01:16:13.104
Storm, thank God you're not hurt.

01:16:14.242 --> 01:16:17.727
- Who is she?
- Marieke. She helped me.

01:16:17.891 --> 01:16:20.928
I've been looking for you everywhere.

01:16:20.929 --> 01:16:23.013
Why has your father been
condemned to death?

01:16:23.175 --> 01:16:25.727
What did he do?

01:16:25.728 --> 01:16:27.811
He printed a letter from Martin Luther.

01:16:29.745 --> 01:16:31.665
I have the rack.

01:16:31.831 --> 01:16:34.347
Really? Boy, do you know what that means?

01:16:34.348 --> 01:16:36.431
The inquisitor wants it.

01:16:36.593 --> 01:16:40.007
If Luther's last letter is printed
and his followers read it...

01:16:40.174 --> 01:16:45.223
- They will rise up against the Inquisitor.
- This is what the inquisitor want to prevent
at all costs.

01:16:45.388 --> 01:16:48.979
Storm, let me help you.
Where is the rack?

01:16:49.142 --> 01:16:51.170
It's safely hidden ...

01:16:54.704 --> 01:16:56.968
I'll go pick it up and bring it to you.

01:16:57.311 --> 01:17:00.346
- Good. Where?
- The Cathedral of Our Lady.

01:17:00.510 --> 01:17:04.232
- This is our only chance.
- I'll be there in an hour.

01:17:04.576 --> 01:17:05.975
Be careful.

01:17:42.467 --> 01:17:43.866
Don't do this.

01:17:44.204 --> 01:17:46.682
- What?
- Don't go.

01:17:46.846 --> 01:17:49.489
I'm going. I have to save my father.

01:17:51.574 --> 01:17:54.917
- What's your problem?
- I don't trust that man.

01:17:56.406 --> 01:18:01.041
- Alwin? Why not?
- How does he know of the Inquisitor?

01:18:01.203 --> 01:18:05.411
Everyone in Antwerp knows about the
Inquisitor. But you wouldn't know that.

01:18:05.583 --> 01:18:07.362
You can't even read.

01:18:09.616 --> 01:18:12.508
- You are so ...
- Alwin is trying to help me.

01:18:12.675 --> 01:18:13.626
I want to help you too.

01:18:13.627 --> 01:18:15.711
No, that's a lie. You're afraid ...

01:18:15.873 --> 01:18:19.669
Luther will force the churches
to remove all the statues,

01:18:19.670 --> 01:18:21.753
your beloved Mary too.

01:18:21.921 --> 01:18:24.673
She's more important to you
than my father's life.

01:18:24.674 --> 01:18:26.758
That's not true!

01:18:26.927 --> 01:18:29.120
That's all you care about.

01:18:30.299 --> 01:18:31.662
Move aside!

01:21:26.506 --> 01:21:28.106
Storm ...

01:21:30.887 --> 01:21:32.593
Did you bring it?

01:21:45.277 --> 01:21:47.055
Martin Luther ...

01:21:48.301 --> 01:21:51.087
Well done, my son. Well done.

01:21:53.898 --> 01:21:56.162
How do we publish it?

01:22:04.709 --> 01:22:06.795
Come on. Alwin?

01:22:22.820 --> 01:22:24.420
Mr. Inquisitor.

01:22:37.837 --> 01:22:40.694
- Alwin?
- Excellent work, Dankers.

01:22:48.822 --> 01:22:51.952
Please, spare my father's life.

01:22:52.124 --> 01:22:54.767
You have the rack. I beg you.

01:22:54.940 --> 01:22:57.801
I promise he'll never print ...

01:22:57.802 --> 01:23:00.927
... forbidden texts again. Please sir.

01:23:02.970 --> 01:23:06.005
Sir. You said that you'd let him go.

01:23:06.168 --> 01:23:11.348
A heretic? As the new poet
of the city you'll be a rich man.

01:23:11.521 --> 01:23:13.584
Why bother about a boy?

01:23:36.966 --> 01:23:39.338
Get those children!

01:23:45.275 --> 01:23:46.840
Open that door!

01:24:15.379 --> 01:24:16.884
They're coming.

01:24:48.298 --> 01:24:49.625
Come on.

01:24:51.809 --> 01:24:53.729
This was once my home.

01:25:26.710 --> 01:25:31.131
You were right about Alwin.

01:25:38.389 --> 01:25:42.004
Your statue of the Virgin Mary
is destroyed.

01:25:44.716 --> 01:25:46.874
And it's all my fault.

01:25:47.741 --> 01:25:49.863
Mary helped us.

01:25:57.683 --> 01:26:00.575
The rack with the letter is gone.

01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:07.730
I missed my chance to save my father.

01:26:15.411 --> 01:26:17.225
Do you have the rack?

01:26:17.393 --> 01:26:21.470
If Luther's last letter is printed
and his followers read it ...

01:26:21.633 --> 01:26:26.540
-They'll rise up against the Inquisitor.
-That's What he wants to prevent at all costs.

01:26:29.455 --> 01:26:31.446
The letter ...

01:26:32.618 --> 01:26:34.123
I still have it!

01:27:10.230 --> 01:27:14.023
The letter must be printed.
We have to find a print shop.

01:27:14.193 --> 01:27:18.200
Why don't we do it ourselves?
You're the son of a printer.

01:27:18.365 --> 01:27:23.972
Yes, but the print shop was ransacked.

01:27:24.135 --> 01:27:26.542
And there are guards outside.

01:27:30.670 --> 01:27:32.899
And I'm not strong enough.

01:27:34.286 --> 01:27:35.921
I'll help you.

01:28:59.625 --> 01:29:01.226
Give me your knife.

01:30:13.424 --> 01:30:15.380
- This here?
- Yes.

01:30:43.493 --> 01:30:44.820
TO ALL DEAR PEOPLE OF ANTWERP

01:30:49.299 --> 01:30:50.804
What does it say?

01:30:51.801 --> 01:30:56.436
To all dear people
of Antwerp who believe in Christ.

01:30:56.599 --> 01:31:00.807
I write this letter to give you
the strength to resist the darkness.

01:31:01.153 --> 01:31:04.223
I know the Catholic Church detests me.

01:31:04.385 --> 01:31:09.636
They accuse me of wanting to
abolish many rituals. The rosaries, psalms ...

01:31:09.808 --> 01:31:13.815
the saints and their images.
And they are right.

01:31:15.405 --> 01:31:17.186
The only holy truth is faith.

01:31:17.187 --> 01:31:20.313
Don't believe anyone except Jesus Christ.

01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:22.709
No man or object can replace him.

01:31:23.052 --> 01:31:26.431
The Pope of Rome is just a mortal who
leads a perverse, decadent church ...

01:31:26.632 --> 01:31:29.453
... where people pay for redemption.

01:31:34.037 --> 01:31:36.752
Only Jesus Christ can redeem us.

01:31:38.104 --> 01:31:40.960
God comes to us through faith alone.

01:31:42.310 --> 01:31:47.040
God is light. God is love. Indugences do not 
help you reach the kingdom of heaven.

01:31:47.212 --> 01:31:51.041
On the contrary, by helping others
you will come closer to God.

01:31:51.209 --> 01:31:54.244
Rise up against the cruel Inquisition.

01:31:54.407 --> 01:31:58.579
Stand against the melomaniacal church
that uses terror to oppress you

01:31:58.752 --> 01:32:00.782
Do not follow the religious tyranny

01:32:00.783 --> 01:32:02.866
of rulers and their inquisitors.

01:32:03.063 --> 01:32:07.698
Don't be intimidated by the Church.
We should be free in our faith.

01:32:07.860 --> 01:32:12.068
Join your hands and stand against injustice.
Do it today ...

01:32:12.240 --> 01:32:15.406
and not a day later.
SIGNED, MARTIN LUTHER

01:32:17.559 --> 01:32:21.423
Spread the word.
Tell everyone about it.

01:32:57.222 --> 01:32:58.514
Cecilia?

01:33:21.137 --> 01:33:22.916
Be ready.

01:33:48.426 --> 01:33:50.903
Out of the way!
clear the path.

01:34:01.496 --> 01:34:02.823
Clear the way!

01:34:04.103 --> 01:34:05.608
Out of the way.

01:34:06.849 --> 01:34:07.868
Out of the way.

01:35:47.345 --> 01:35:49.301
This is my father!

01:35:56.210 --> 01:36:00.845
He did nothing wrong.
He just printed a letter from Luther.

01:36:01.180 --> 01:36:03.480
And he will be killed for it.

01:36:03.648 --> 01:36:05.355
By that man!

01:36:06.569 --> 01:36:09.142
Why do you allow him to be so cruel?

01:36:09.143 --> 01:36:10.185
Get him!

01:36:15.259 --> 01:36:17.382
There are hundreds of you.

01:36:19.291 --> 01:36:20.891
Do something!

01:36:21.064 --> 01:36:24.027
Come on, he's right, do something!

01:36:41.365 --> 01:36:43.001
Let's go!

01:37:52.766 --> 01:37:54.200
Mother.

01:38:06.392 --> 01:38:07.755
Come on, hurry up.

01:38:08.965 --> 01:38:10.778
We have to leave.

01:38:12.371 --> 01:38:14.042
Hurry up, we have to go.

01:38:15.118 --> 01:38:17.073
Here, Storm, take this.

01:38:18.108 --> 01:38:19.435
It's heavy.

01:38:21.062 --> 01:38:23.090
Thanks for everything.

01:38:27.319 --> 01:38:29.382
- Brave girl.
- We have to go.

01:38:29.544 --> 01:38:30.871
Come here.

01:38:32.394 --> 01:38:33.959
Come on, Storm.

01:38:41.259 --> 01:38:44.186
- Storm?
- Storm, are you coming?

01:39:19.566 --> 01:39:24.331
WÜRTTEMBERG - 1 year later

01:39:27.700 --> 01:39:29.443
VOETEN AND SON PRINT SHOP

01:39:30.133 --> 01:39:31.665
How are you?
Your book is ready.

01:39:31.666 --> 01:39:33.749
Great, thank you.

01:39:37.433 --> 01:39:42.068
Exceptional. You really are the
best printers in Württemberg.

01:39:42.231 --> 01:39:46.581
- Well, I have a great partner.
- Thank you very much.

01:39:46.750 --> 01:39:48.813
And my sweet assistant.
