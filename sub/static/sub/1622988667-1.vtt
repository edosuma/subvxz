00:37.159 --> 00:39.995
Mommy, look at my dragon!

00:40.030 --> 00:42.766
Mm-hm, lovely, darling.

00:45.804 --> 00:46.605
Huh?

00:49.544 --> 00:52.545
Mommy, there really is a dragon!

00:52.580 --> 00:55.481
Yes, that's great, sweetie.

01:08.825 --> 01:12.662
Hmm, we're getting
close now, I can feel it!

01:13.665 --> 01:15.467
Smell it, you mean.

01:15.502 --> 01:19.833
Oh-ho, by my stinky socks,
what an incredible stench!

01:24.070 --> 01:28.072
By my other stinky socks,
Firebottom's found it now!

01:32.748 --> 01:34.583
We're there!

01:38.589 --> 01:39.951
Mommy, look!

01:39.986 --> 01:42.656
We'll be going home in
a minute, darling, okay?

01:45.122 --> 01:49.729
By my toady farts,
Firebottom's in a hurry!

01:57.672 --> 01:59.903
Prepare for a crash landing!

01:59.938 --> 02:01.905
And ready!

02:01.940 --> 02:04.710
Just aim for something
soft, Firebottom.

02:04.745 --> 02:05.579
Uh, Mom?

02:11.487 --> 02:13.179
Can you pack up
your kite, please?

02:13.214 --> 02:14.048
Whoa!

02:18.955 --> 02:20.922
Ah, there's a good girl.

02:32.869 --> 02:35.441
Wow, plenty of traffic today.

03:02.864 --> 03:04.567
Again, again!

03:04.602 --> 03:06.964
Galloping gargoyles,
look at this!

03:06.999 --> 03:10.066
Nothing but wonderful,
smelly rubbish!

03:13.269 --> 03:16.974
Wooh, an Oggly always lands
on his cheesy feet!

03:17.009 --> 03:18.139
Good boy, Firebottom!

03:19.879 --> 03:23.980
By my toady turds,
are we there already?

03:24.015 --> 03:26.279
See, kids, what
did I tell you?

03:26.314 --> 03:28.215
This place is perfect!

03:28.250 --> 03:30.117
Slimy!

03:44.902 --> 03:46.902
Lotta, I'll be
home in a minute.

03:46.937 --> 03:49.575
Home? I thought
you were coming to meet us?

03:49.610 --> 03:51.841
Is the pressure
booster finished?

03:51.876 --> 03:52.908
Whoa!

03:52.943 --> 03:53.908
Hey, watch it!

03:53.943 --> 03:55.844
I just have to connect
the tank to the mixer!

03:55.879 --> 03:57.010
- Oh!
- Whoa!

03:57.045 --> 03:57.846
Hello, Max.

03:57.881 --> 03:59.210
Sorry!

03:59.245 --> 04:01.850
Yeah, that boy is
always in a hurry.

04:03.854 --> 04:05.216
Sure, take your time.

04:05.251 --> 04:07.888
It's only the most
important day ever.

04:07.923 --> 04:10.220
I know, I'll be right there.

04:14.996 --> 04:16.930
Anybody home?

04:16.964 --> 04:17.798
Mom?

04:19.901 --> 04:20.735
Yes!

04:22.299 --> 04:23.837
Oh, there it is.

04:35.146 --> 04:35.947
Max?

04:35.982 --> 04:37.014
Mom!

04:37.049 --> 04:38.587
You're half an hour early.

04:38.622 --> 04:41.689
Um, maths finished
early!

04:41.723 --> 04:43.558
Hmm.

04:54.262 --> 04:55.096
Huh.

05:03.073 --> 05:04.072
Max?

05:06.812 --> 05:09.175
Are you hiding something?

05:09.210 --> 05:10.979
No.

05:11.014 --> 05:11.947
Nothing, why?

05:13.016 --> 05:13.883
What?

05:13.918 --> 05:14.917
Oh, it's time for-

05:14.952 --> 05:16.952
- Cello practice?

05:16.987 --> 05:18.084
Where did that come from?

05:18.119 --> 05:20.119
We talked about this.

05:20.154 --> 05:21.758
You've got to learn

05:21.793 --> 05:23.287
how to schedule your
time more effectively

05:23.322 --> 05:25.322
or you'll never be prepared
for the adult world.

05:25.357 --> 05:27.962
And since you've got a
spare half hour right now-

05:27.997 --> 05:30.359
- What? But it's holidays, Mom!

05:30.394 --> 05:32.262
More time to learn.

05:32.297 --> 05:34.099
Seize the day, my son.

05:34.134 --> 05:34.968
Yes, Mom.

05:47.817 --> 05:48.651
Hmm.

05:54.053 --> 05:54.920
Hmm.

06:00.796 --> 06:01.355
Phew.

06:09.837 --> 06:10.704
Oh.

06:18.141 --> 06:19.008
Oh.

06:33.254 --> 06:34.253
Whoa!

06:34.288 --> 06:35.925
Was that it?

06:35.960 --> 06:36.992
I played faster today.

06:37.027 --> 06:38.092
I'm just going over to Lotta's.

06:38.127 --> 06:39.126
Hmm.

06:42.361 --> 06:44.097
Hold on a minute, young man!

06:44.132 --> 06:46.165
It says here you've got
to practice English.

06:46.200 --> 06:48.101
Exactly, with Lotta.

06:48.136 --> 06:50.169
You're not going
over to see her uncle,

06:50.204 --> 06:56.746
the professor, are you?

06:56.781 --> 06:57.472
Of course not!

06:57.507 --> 06:59.012
See you later, Mom!

06:59.047 --> 07:00.981
At three, you've
got kid's yoga,

07:01.016 --> 07:04.446
at 4:30, young entrepreneur's
training and dinner's at six!

07:05.954 --> 07:06.586
Ugh!

07:08.418 --> 07:10.286
That disgusting rubbish dump.

07:10.321 --> 07:12.453
When is this going to end?

07:18.933 --> 07:20.427
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

07:20.462 --> 07:22.869
There is a crisis
in Smelliville.

07:22.904 --> 07:25.036
With the stench from
the local rubbish dump

07:25.071 --> 07:28.072
only getting worse and
tourism at an all-time low,

07:28.107 --> 07:32.240
is there any hope for this
once prosperous little town?

07:32.275 --> 07:33.747
The streets feel empty.

07:33.782 --> 07:36.112
Businesses are
struggling to stay open.

07:36.147 --> 07:37.949
It isn't just tourists.

07:37.984 --> 07:40.182
No one comes out much anymore.

07:40.217 --> 07:43.085
Since Smelliville's
last remaining bin man,

07:43.120 --> 07:45.483
Jack No Nose McGee,
quit last month,

07:45.518 --> 07:47.859
things have gone
from bad to worse.

07:47.894 --> 07:49.960
The situation has
reached breaking point.

07:49.995 --> 07:52.897
Well the good news is
not even criminals go out.

07:52.932 --> 07:54.458
It's far too smelly to steal.

07:54.493 --> 07:57.329
It's all the mayor's
fault if you ask me.

07:57.364 --> 08:00.002
They say his wife
is the only one

08:00.037 --> 08:02.235
who gets anything
done around here.

08:04.569 --> 08:07.470
I just don't know
where to start.

08:09.045 --> 08:10.374
- Well!
- Oh!

08:10.409 --> 08:12.013
Good thing I'm
here to save the day.

08:12.048 --> 08:12.948
Hello, dear.

08:12.983 --> 08:14.345
If only you could!

08:14.380 --> 08:15.984
I'm beginning to
think our only hope

08:16.019 --> 08:17.381
is Professor Foamworthy.

08:17.416 --> 08:18.821
He said he'd invented-

08:18.856 --> 08:20.515
- Don't listen to that nutcase!

08:20.550 --> 08:23.056
I've got a much better idea.

08:24.323 --> 08:27.192
All this stress has been
no good for you, Edward.

08:27.227 --> 08:30.931
So I'm sending, I
mean, treating you,

08:30.966 --> 08:33.230
to a luxury spa weekend.

08:33.265 --> 08:36.837
You'll be pampered like
a king for three days.

08:36.873 --> 08:38.169
A free weekend would
certainly be nice

08:38.203 --> 08:40.006
but are you sure, darling?

08:40.041 --> 08:41.808
Of course!

08:41.844 --> 08:46.209
Rest, recuperate and come
back ready to save the town.

08:46.915 --> 08:47.342
Muah!

08:48.278 --> 08:52.248
Free fluffy bathrobes
and slippers, hmm.

08:58.255 --> 08:59.584
I'm telling you, Lotta.

08:59.619 --> 09:02.158
This is the only way
to save the town.

09:02.193 --> 09:03.995
Well, if it works.

09:04.030 --> 09:05.490
Of course, it'll work!

09:05.525 --> 09:08.295
You and Max helped out
so much on this one!

09:08.330 --> 09:12.871
We've created a winner
together, you'll see!

09:19.043 --> 09:20.944
Wow, take a look at this!

09:20.979 --> 09:23.507
The Stinkometer
is off the scale.

09:23.542 --> 09:25.146
Oh, wonderful!

09:25.181 --> 09:28.578
Then this must be the
perfect spot, ha-ha!

09:35.894 --> 09:37.520
Hmm.

09:41.262 --> 09:42.326
Lady Mayoress.

09:43.395 --> 09:44.328
Mr. Hammer!

09:44.363 --> 09:46.264
The rumors are true.

09:46.299 --> 09:49.135
All the neighboring cities
are planning something big,

09:49.170 --> 09:51.269
gigantic attractions everywhere.

09:51.304 --> 09:53.139
Oh but that's terrible.

09:53.174 --> 09:56.273
I thought you were going to
bring me good news, Mr. Hammer.

09:56.308 --> 09:58.044
Where are my anti-stress drops?

09:58.079 --> 10:01.278
First of all, is the
Mayor safely out of town

10:01.313 --> 10:02.378
as we agreed?

10:04.118 --> 10:05.578
Yes, he's gone.

10:05.613 --> 10:07.481
He doesn't suspect a thing.

10:07.516 --> 10:11.122
Good, because we've got to
get construction well underway

10:11.157 --> 10:12.552
before he gets back.

10:12.587 --> 10:14.961
This is Smelliville
as it stands right now

10:14.996 --> 10:18.029
and this is the
shabby rubbish dump.

10:20.429 --> 10:24.332
Bye bye, rubbish dump.
Hello wellness temple!

10:24.367 --> 10:26.268
My wellness temple!

10:27.304 --> 10:29.271
It's beautiful!

10:29.306 --> 10:32.108
Oh, Mr. Hammer, you're a genius!

10:33.507 --> 10:36.145
You're not the first
person to tell me that.

10:36.180 --> 10:40.281
Everything built to your
specifications, Mayoress.

10:41.481 --> 10:44.922
Our neighboring cities
will be green with envy

10:44.957 --> 10:46.484
when they see this!

10:46.519 --> 10:49.124
Overnight, we'll
become the number one

10:49.159 --> 10:53.161
tourist destination
in the whole region!

10:53.196 --> 10:56.130
But wait, what do we do
with all the rubbish?

10:56.165 --> 11:00.167
Just, leave the details
to me, your worshipfullness.

11:00.202 --> 11:01.235
But-

11:01.270 --> 11:03.137
- You came to me for a
quick solution, didn't you?

11:03.172 --> 11:04.974
Oh, yes but-

11:05.009 --> 11:07.437
- You're not getting
cold feet, are you?

11:07.472 --> 11:09.274
No.

11:09.309 --> 11:13.509
Believe me, this is the
only way to save your town.

11:14.545 --> 11:16.116
Tudeli woop woop ooh.

11:16.151 --> 11:17.446
Yes, Mr. Hammer.

11:23.157 --> 11:25.322
Whoa, what happened here?

11:37.434 --> 11:39.973
Hoohoo! Fetid
frogs, my stinkerlings!

11:40.008 --> 11:41.336
Whoa, what the?

11:47.146 --> 11:51.412
I think the Oggly cave is
almost finished!

11:51.447 --> 11:54.315
Newty! Our new home!

11:58.387 --> 11:59.485
What?

11:59.520 --> 12:00.321
Oh!

12:02.259 --> 12:04.094
It's a dragon!

12:04.129 --> 12:04.963
Ew, ew!

12:07.692 --> 12:08.526
Ew!

12:13.335 --> 12:16.105
Thanks to our latest
invention, the De-Stinkomat,

12:16.140 --> 12:19.503
which sucks in the stinky
air from the rubbish dump

12:19.538 --> 12:23.276
and distills it into a highly
concentrated liquid extract,

12:23.311 --> 12:27.214
Smelliville's smelly problem
will soon be history!

12:28.745 --> 12:30.150
Where are you?

12:30.185 --> 12:31.118
I'm at the dump but-

12:31.153 --> 12:32.482
- About time!

12:32.517 --> 12:34.121
We're just setting
up the De-Stinkomat.

12:34.156 --> 12:36.519
What a marvelously
yucky place.

12:36.554 --> 12:38.455
Lotta, you're
not gonna believe this.

12:38.490 --> 12:39.588
I just saw a whole family of-

12:39.623 --> 12:41.556
- Green creatures?

12:41.591 --> 12:43.459
Yes, exactly!

12:43.494 --> 12:45.131
Professor, there's
something you need to see!

12:45.166 --> 12:46.462
Ah, Max, at last!

12:46.497 --> 12:48.299
Did you bring the
pressure booster?

12:48.334 --> 12:49.135
It's right here but-

12:49.170 --> 12:50.499
- Splendid!

12:50.534 --> 12:52.303
Our months of work
will finally pay off.

12:52.338 --> 12:54.568
I'll be able to
smell my roses again!

12:54.603 --> 12:56.537
Earth to Uncle, over here!

12:56.572 --> 12:59.606
Max, if this works, it
could change the world.

12:59.641 --> 13:03.379
Think of the fishermen, the
bin men, the toilet cleaners!

13:08.187 --> 13:11.485
It's working!

13:11.520 --> 13:13.289
An Oggly day!

13:13.324 --> 13:14.224
What? What?

13:14.259 --> 13:15.588
What? What?

13:15.623 --> 13:17.161
What's going on?

13:17.196 --> 13:18.425
Whoa!

13:19.758 --> 13:21.626
What's
happening, Max?

13:21.661 --> 13:24.266
I don't know!

13:24.301 --> 13:25.498
Oh no!

13:25.533 --> 13:27.302
It's too strong!

13:27.337 --> 13:31.140
It's supposed to suck in
the air, not the rubbish!

13:31.175 --> 13:31.800
Oh-ho!

13:32.836 --> 13:35.177
Hey, my helmet!

13:37.478 --> 13:39.214
No, no, stop, Max!

13:39.249 --> 13:40.479
Max, we have to stop it!

13:40.514 --> 13:42.117
Stop!

13:42.152 --> 13:46.088
Rancid rust-buckets,
you monster machine!

13:46.123 --> 13:47.485
Go away!

13:50.820 --> 13:53.490
Don't worry, everything
is under control!

13:53.525 --> 13:55.822
Professor, you've got
to attach the grommet

13:55.857 --> 13:58.594
via the bimetallic fishplate!

13:58.629 --> 14:01.300
Hey, where's
Oggly Grandma gone?

14:01.335 --> 14:02.532
More green creatures?

14:02.567 --> 14:04.666
I told you so.

14:04.701 --> 14:07.437
Are you
all right in there?

14:07.472 --> 14:08.834
Oggly Grandma?

14:08.869 --> 14:10.473
Are you in there?

14:26.325 --> 14:30.788
I haven't been tickled
like that for 753 years!

14:30.823 --> 14:33.626
Oh my goodness, what happened?

14:33.661 --> 14:35.430
Oh, dear, are you all right?

14:35.465 --> 14:36.728
Oh, I do beg your pardon.

14:36.763 --> 14:38.631
Your dress is filthy
and your hair!

14:38.666 --> 14:41.600
Oh no, and you've
gone green!

14:41.635 --> 14:43.239
You're all green!

14:43.274 --> 14:45.274
Hmm, slimeballs on toast,

14:45.309 --> 14:47.573
that's a fine machine
you have there.

14:49.181 --> 14:50.609
I do the odd bit of
tinkering myself.

14:50.644 --> 14:52.446
Phew, my
glasses are still okay!

14:52.481 --> 14:56.383
Well, good for you but my
helmet is still in there.

14:56.418 --> 14:59.386
Hmm, an umbrella
that lets the rain in.

14:59.421 --> 15:01.553
Ah, excellent idea!

15:01.588 --> 15:03.126
Um, Professor?

15:08.297 --> 15:11.661
There's your helmet.

15:11.696 --> 15:12.596
Oh, dear.

15:17.668 --> 15:19.602
- Oh!
- Max, hello?

15:19.637 --> 15:21.274
Are you okay?

15:21.309 --> 15:22.374
Where am I?

15:23.839 --> 15:25.707
Told you he'd be fine!

15:25.742 --> 15:26.576
Huh?

15:27.711 --> 15:28.545
Uh, uh!

15:30.614 --> 15:32.647
Welcome to our Oggly cave!

15:32.682 --> 15:33.879
We're the Ogglies.

15:33.914 --> 15:34.880
This is Mothy.

15:34.915 --> 15:36.420
And this is Messy.

15:36.455 --> 15:38.224
And
this is Oggly Grandpa,

15:38.259 --> 15:42.656
Grandma, Oggly Mum,
Oggly Dad and Oggly Baby.

15:42.691 --> 15:43.591
Okay.

15:43.626 --> 15:45.626
I'm Lotta and this is-

15:47.630 --> 15:49.333
- Max.

15:49.368 --> 15:50.631
How do you do?

15:50.666 --> 15:52.732
Foamworthy.
Professor Foamworthy.

15:52.767 --> 15:54.634
I know the perfect thing

15:54.669 --> 15:56.900
to get you back on
your feet, young man.

15:56.935 --> 15:58.704
- Huh?
- Huh?

15:58.739 --> 16:00.310
Me?

16:00.345 --> 16:02.906
Old batteries
in melted plastic.

16:05.877 --> 16:07.613
There's no way
we can eat this!

16:09.947 --> 16:12.882
Oh, I'm so sorry, no wonder
you don't want to dig in.

16:12.917 --> 16:13.784
Here.

16:13.819 --> 16:14.653
What?

16:15.755 --> 16:16.820
Huh?

16:16.855 --> 16:18.392
Um, thank you?

16:19.824 --> 16:22.924
Aw, thank you!

16:22.959 --> 16:26.895
Grand greasy gruelbuckets,
so warty yummy!

16:32.803 --> 16:36.607
You've out-Ogglied
yourself again, Oggly Mum!

16:37.709 --> 16:39.247
These
people eat rubbish.

16:39.282 --> 16:40.644
Yes, lots of it!

16:41.745 --> 16:43.448
Yes, but Max, I've
got some bad news.

16:43.483 --> 16:46.352
Professor, look
at the Ogglies!

16:46.387 --> 16:48.321
The De-Stinkomat it's ruined.

16:48.356 --> 16:49.388
I know but-

16:49.423 --> 16:50.752
- I'll need to tell your father

16:50.787 --> 16:52.787
that we can't help
the town after all.

16:52.822 --> 16:53.754
I'm so sorry.

16:53.789 --> 16:55.690
All that work and-

16:55.725 --> 16:58.924
- But I don't think we need
the De-Stinkomat anymore.

16:58.959 --> 17:01.267
Eh? What do you mean?

17:01.302 --> 17:03.830
Look at the
Ogglies, Professor.

17:07.538 --> 17:08.768
You mean-

17:08.803 --> 17:10.803
- Yes, the Ogglies eat rubbish!

17:10.838 --> 17:12.673
They could solve our problem!

17:13.742 --> 17:14.939
Of course!

17:14.973 --> 17:16.710
It's so great
you came to town!

17:16.744 --> 17:18.876
Huh?

17:18.911 --> 17:21.846
I told you he'd
be back on his feet.

17:54.515 --> 17:56.416
Dad, I've got great news!

17:56.451 --> 17:58.715
I've just been to the rubbish
dump with Professor Foamworthy

17:58.750 --> 18:00.816
to try out the De-Stinkomat!

18:00.851 --> 18:02.620
It doesn't work

18:02.655 --> 18:05.490
but then there were these
green creatures, Ogglies!

18:05.525 --> 18:07.888
They seem to be some
kind of natural recyclers

18:07.923 --> 18:09.428
and then there was a dragon!

18:09.463 --> 18:10.726
And it could help the town!

18:10.761 --> 18:13.300
Green creatures? A dragon?

18:14.369 --> 18:15.797
Professor Foamworthy?

18:17.437 --> 18:18.469
Mom!

18:18.504 --> 18:19.800
How often have I told you

18:19.835 --> 18:22.033
not to hang around
with that nutcase?

18:22.068 --> 18:23.606
And look at you!

18:24.807 --> 18:28.105
Oh, where are my
anti-stress drops?

18:28.140 --> 18:30.480
I know, Mom, and I'm sorry!

18:30.515 --> 18:32.042
But the Ogglies could
help us with the problem!

18:32.077 --> 18:33.483
Enough!

18:33.518 --> 18:35.045
This is obviously what happens

18:35.080 --> 18:36.882
when I give you
too much freedom.

18:36.917 --> 18:37.751
But we can change that.

18:37.786 --> 18:38.950
Mom, please!

18:40.822 --> 18:42.051
Where's the dump gone?

18:42.086 --> 18:43.657
What is that?

18:43.692 --> 18:44.823
None of your business.

18:44.858 --> 18:45.659
But Mom!

18:45.694 --> 18:46.726
Come on!

18:46.761 --> 18:47.826
There are people living there!

18:47.861 --> 18:49.399
The Ogglies!

18:49.434 --> 18:50.125
That's quite enough

18:50.160 --> 18:50.959
for one day, young man.

18:50.994 --> 18:52.567
I think it's time
I took you home!

18:52.602 --> 18:53.402
Yes, ma'am.

18:58.904 --> 19:01.003
So, what
did your dad say?

19:01.038 --> 19:02.939
He's gone away for a few days.

19:02.974 --> 19:05.479
But my mother went nuts.

19:05.514 --> 19:07.107
I'm grounded for
the whole weekend.

19:07.142 --> 19:09.351
What? That's not fair.

19:10.486 --> 19:11.749
You know my mother.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.817
But check this.

19:13.852 --> 19:17.083
That's the model of Smelliville
you made for your father.

19:17.118 --> 19:19.855
You want me to tell you
how great it is, again?

19:19.890 --> 19:21.527
No, look.

19:21.562 --> 19:24.827
Where the dump used to
be, now there's this!

19:24.862 --> 19:25.927
What is it?

19:26.996 --> 19:28.028
I don't know.

19:28.063 --> 19:29.930
My mom won't tell me.

19:29.965 --> 19:31.734
But whatever it is-

19:31.769 --> 19:34.099
- It's where the
Ogglies live now!

19:36.037 --> 19:36.871
Exactly.

19:56.220 --> 19:59.793
Slimy swamps and cheesy feet,

19:59.828 --> 20:04.468
I haven't slept like
that in ages!

20:04.503 --> 20:06.667
It's the air quality.

20:06.702 --> 20:10.836
This really is a particularly
aromatic rubbish dump.

20:12.070 --> 20:13.674
It's Ogglorious!

20:13.709 --> 20:16.105
Just think, if we
hadn't been kicked out

20:16.140 --> 20:20.812
of all those other towns, we
wouldn't have ended up here.

20:20.847 --> 20:22.616
Yeah, it's great.

20:22.651 --> 20:26.048
Um, can we really stay
in this dump for a while?

20:26.083 --> 20:27.918
A long while?

20:27.953 --> 20:29.787
Oggsolutely!

20:29.822 --> 20:32.922
The residents of this town
are different from the others.

20:32.957 --> 20:35.892
Well, think about
Max and his friends.

20:35.927 --> 20:39.830
No one would live in
such a smelly town

20:39.865 --> 20:41.732
if they didn't want it that way.

20:41.767 --> 20:43.800
Let's pay them a visit later on.

20:43.835 --> 20:45.901
I'm sure they'll welcome us.

20:47.575 --> 20:51.137
This weekend is extremely
important for Smelliville, Max.

20:51.172 --> 20:52.841
For me too.

20:52.876 --> 20:54.172
Yes, Mom.

20:54.207 --> 20:55.910
That's why I've
got to go to work.

20:55.945 --> 20:57.549
Yes, Mom.

20:57.584 --> 20:59.947
So I won't be able
to keep an eye on you

20:59.982 --> 21:01.949
but I think that this-

21:03.084 --> 21:04.556
will keep you out of trouble.

21:04.591 --> 21:06.623
Cello practice,

21:06.658 --> 21:07.855
English, maths?

21:09.023 --> 21:10.792
But I didn't
forget a lunch break.

21:10.827 --> 21:12.123
Yes, 15 minutes.

21:13.258 --> 21:14.631
Thanks, Mom.

21:14.666 --> 21:15.995
Max, I only want-

21:16.030 --> 21:18.260
- You only want to
prepare me for life.

21:18.295 --> 21:19.932
I know, Mom.

21:19.967 --> 21:22.264
If your father had had
an education like this,

21:22.299 --> 21:24.937
he'd be able to cope
with being mayor.

21:28.239 --> 21:30.942
I'll check on you
later, okay darling?

21:30.977 --> 21:31.910
Yes, Mom.

21:51.161 --> 21:51.962
Oh!

22:03.271 --> 22:04.105
Let's go!

22:05.943 --> 22:08.273
If your mother finds
out, you're dead.

22:08.308 --> 22:10.616
No death scheduled
for me today.

22:10.651 --> 22:11.584
I checked.

22:17.217 --> 22:18.051
Huh?

22:23.795 --> 22:24.695
Hm.

22:27.194 --> 22:28.160
Hmm.

22:49.280 --> 22:51.918
My face!

22:54.086 --> 22:56.020
Oh, here!

22:56.055 --> 22:57.153
Hello!

22:59.289 --> 23:00.794
Hello.

23:03.667 --> 23:04.600
Hello again.

23:05.327 --> 23:06.766
- Ah!
- Oh!

23:06.801 --> 23:07.734
Um, hi!

23:09.166 --> 23:11.034
How
nice you came to visit!

23:11.069 --> 23:13.366
Farting flies, talking visit,

23:13.401 --> 23:17.369
it's time to go see this
lovely stinky town up close!

23:17.404 --> 23:18.843
Right, Firebottom?

23:19.714 --> 23:20.339
Walkies.

23:21.650 --> 23:23.045
Newty!

23:25.720 --> 23:26.983
Wow!

23:27.018 --> 23:28.050
Whoa!

23:28.986 --> 23:30.183
Can we stay here?

23:30.218 --> 23:31.690
And hang out
with Max and Lotta?

23:31.725 --> 23:32.922
Yeah!

23:32.957 --> 23:34.924
Slimy snotrags, of
course, you can!

23:34.959 --> 23:36.189
Ogglies can do-

23:36.224 --> 23:37.322
- What they want.

23:37.357 --> 23:38.763
Whenever they want.

23:38.798 --> 23:41.930
Oh, as often as they want.

23:44.264 --> 23:45.736
Whoa!

23:51.139 --> 23:52.907
Have fun!

23:55.076 --> 23:59.078
Actually, we wanted
to talk to your parents.

23:59.113 --> 24:00.046
Oh.

24:00.081 --> 24:01.652
What about?

24:01.687 --> 24:04.984
We, um, wanted to
show them something.

24:07.417 --> 24:09.087
What's that?

24:09.122 --> 24:11.221
It's a model of a building.

24:11.256 --> 24:14.961
And it looks like it's going
to be built right here.

24:14.996 --> 24:16.358
Whiffy fish farts!

24:16.393 --> 24:18.326
Does that mean we'll
have to move again?

24:18.361 --> 24:21.296
No, I mean, I don't know.

24:21.331 --> 24:24.233
But I took a closer
look last night.

24:24.268 --> 24:26.334
Hmm, doesn't ring a bell.

24:26.369 --> 24:28.907
Because it's a
logo of a new company

24:28.942 --> 24:29.875
that just opened here recently.

24:29.910 --> 24:31.272
Hmm.

24:31.307 --> 24:34.011
It's called
Hammer Construction.

24:34.046 --> 24:36.145
Let's all go and find
out what's going on!

24:36.180 --> 24:37.179
Huh?

24:37.214 --> 24:38.114
If you want to.

24:38.149 --> 24:39.181
Yay!

24:39.216 --> 24:40.951
But we've only have two bikes.

24:40.986 --> 24:41.820
Huh.

24:43.087 --> 24:45.087
Hmm.

24:48.191 --> 24:49.927
Woohoo!

24:49.962 --> 24:51.126
- Woohoo!
- Yeah!

24:52.766 --> 24:54.194
Whoo!

24:54.229 --> 24:55.030
Yeah!

24:55.065 --> 24:55.899
Woohooo!

24:57.771 --> 24:58.396
Whoo!

24:59.599 --> 25:01.432
At the next
opportunity, please turn left.

25:01.467 --> 25:03.203
Go left!

25:03.238 --> 25:04.303
- Whoa!
- Whoo!

25:04.338 --> 25:05.171
Whoo!

25:07.846 --> 25:09.142
Ugh, disgusting!

25:13.115 --> 25:14.180
Whoo!

25:17.085 --> 25:17.919
Whoo!

25:20.385 --> 25:24.288
Okay, I've got approval
from the mayor's office.

25:24.323 --> 25:29.325
This job is extremely important
for me, us!

25:30.966 --> 25:34.297
This will be the new rise
of Hammer Construction!

25:34.332 --> 25:35.969
Uh-huh, okay.

25:36.004 --> 25:38.334
Eh, boss, why don't
we build the temple

25:38.369 --> 25:40.402
beside the rubbish dump?

25:40.437 --> 25:43.074
You sound like the mayoress.

25:43.109 --> 25:44.504
Huh?

25:44.539 --> 25:47.408
Because if I build the
temple somewhere else,

25:47.443 --> 25:49.278
then I'll only be
building a temple.

25:49.313 --> 25:50.983
Yes.

25:51.018 --> 25:53.182
But if I build the
temple on the rubbish dump

25:53.217 --> 25:55.184
and then a new rubbish
dump somewhere else,

25:55.219 --> 25:57.054
then I'm building twice.

25:57.089 --> 25:59.221
And then the new rubbish
dump will smell even worse

25:59.256 --> 26:02.224
and so we build another
temple again on top of it

26:02.259 --> 26:06.161
and build a new dump
again and so on and so on

26:06.196 --> 26:08.196
until there is no
place left to build

26:08.231 --> 26:10.869
and the town runs out of money.

26:14.237 --> 26:16.072
Uh.

26:16.107 --> 26:20.405
I will be so filthy rich when
we are done with this town.

26:21.276 --> 26:23.276
And if I'm rich, you have a job!

26:25.412 --> 26:28.753
Eh, boss, we already
have a job, boss.

26:30.856 --> 26:31.488
Oh.

26:32.484 --> 26:35.254
If I get very, very, very rich,

26:37.093 --> 26:39.390
you might just keep your jobs!

26:41.261 --> 26:42.799
Yes, boss!

26:42.834 --> 26:43.525
Aw!

26:43.560 --> 26:45.197
Yes, boss!

26:45.232 --> 26:48.068
Um, but this plan makes
no sense for the town.

26:48.103 --> 26:49.003
Uh-huh.

26:49.038 --> 26:50.840
No, not for the town.

26:51.942 --> 26:53.006
For me!

26:53.041 --> 26:54.304
Oh.

26:54.339 --> 26:56.273
And when Smelliville
is bankrupt,

26:56.308 --> 27:00.442
we will move on to the
next town!

27:00.477 --> 27:03.280
Gentlemen, start
your bulldozers!

27:23.971 --> 27:26.136
Are you sure
this is the right place?

27:26.171 --> 27:27.940
Maybe the
directions are wrong.

27:27.975 --> 27:29.842
Nope, I double checked.

27:29.877 --> 27:31.338
Must be here somewhere.

27:31.373 --> 27:32.944
Let me check that.

27:32.979 --> 27:34.044
You might have made
a mistake for once.

27:34.079 --> 27:35.177
What?

27:35.212 --> 27:36.915
Is that what you mean?

27:36.950 --> 27:38.081
- Oh.
- Yup, that's it.

27:38.116 --> 27:38.983
Oh!

27:39.018 --> 27:40.885
Ooh, Max, what?

27:40.920 --> 27:42.953
Whoa!

27:42.988 --> 27:43.987
You guys keep watch.

27:44.022 --> 27:46.352
I'll check out the place!

27:46.387 --> 27:49.157
Did Max just go
all heroic on us?

27:49.192 --> 27:50.554
- Yeah.
- Mm-hm.

28:00.202 --> 28:02.466
Hello, Mrs. De
Oderant. How's business?

28:02.501 --> 28:04.401
Eh, it isn't.

28:04.436 --> 28:07.437
The occasional air freshener
or two but otherwise.

28:07.472 --> 28:09.439
I'm gonna have to
close my shop soon.

28:09.474 --> 28:11.441
Oh, I know what you mean.

28:11.476 --> 28:14.114
With this stink, nobody is
leaving the house anymore.

28:14.149 --> 28:16.281
Yeah.

28:17.448 --> 28:20.152
Is the mayor ever
going to do anything?

28:20.187 --> 28:21.516
I wouldn't count on it.

28:21.551 --> 28:23.254
Hey, haven't you heard?

28:23.289 --> 28:24.222
What?

28:24.257 --> 28:25.927
The Lady Mayoress
wants to build some kind

28:25.962 --> 28:27.489
of super spa in town.

28:27.524 --> 28:30.128
Oh, what a beautiful idea!

28:30.163 --> 28:34.363
Oh, a bit of wellness would
do me the world of good.

28:34.398 --> 28:37.465
Anyways, it says here
it'll attract tourists.

28:37.500 --> 28:39.302
Tourists go shopping!

28:39.337 --> 28:41.138
Tourist eat a pizza!

28:41.173 --> 28:42.469
And ride bikes!

28:42.504 --> 28:44.174
And take taxis!

28:44.209 --> 28:47.342
Ah, finally something's
happening!

28:47.377 --> 28:48.409
Oh?

28:48.444 --> 28:49.179
- What's that?
- Huh?

28:49.214 --> 28:50.477
Mamma mia!

28:50.512 --> 28:52.050
An earthquake.

29:02.523 --> 29:03.588
Madonna!

29:03.623 --> 29:04.555
Aliens!

29:10.596 --> 29:12.200
Ho!

29:13.467 --> 29:14.334
You go.

29:17.338 --> 29:19.503
Oh no, oh
no, oh no!

29:20.605 --> 29:23.276
Ah, not so much going on here.

29:25.247 --> 29:27.346
Ah, a newty day to you all!

29:37.522 --> 29:39.687
Humans, always in a hurry.

29:40.557 --> 29:41.424
Aye.

29:42.493 --> 29:44.328
Police!

29:44.363 --> 29:45.197
Police!

29:46.596 --> 29:48.299
Tell me something
I don't know.

29:48.334 --> 29:50.004
Out there, aliens!

29:51.205 --> 29:52.434
One second.

29:56.176 --> 29:58.077
Right, what's going on?

29:59.377 --> 30:00.739
Aliens!

30:00.774 --> 30:03.280
Yes, yes, tell me
something I don't know.

30:03.315 --> 30:04.742
In the marketplace!

30:04.777 --> 30:08.185
Calm down, aliens
only land in America,

30:08.220 --> 30:10.517
everybody knows that.

30:10.552 --> 30:11.991
Hello!

30:12.026 --> 30:13.388
Aliens!

30:13.423 --> 30:16.160
Tell us
something we don't know.

30:16.194 --> 30:20.427
Oh, slimy swamps and
cheesy feet, used chain oil!

30:22.662 --> 30:24.464
Matured in plastic bottles.

30:24.499 --> 30:28.500
Oh, cheesy toes and
chicken farts, Oggly Grandpa.

30:28.535 --> 30:30.568
It's not even 12 o'clock yet.

30:30.603 --> 30:32.240
Ah, talk away woman.

30:32.275 --> 30:35.243
Nah, what do we have,
a 2016 Flexochain.

30:35.278 --> 30:37.311
Excellent year!

30:37.346 --> 30:38.642
Mm!

30:46.255 --> 30:47.518
Delicious, muah!

30:53.360 --> 30:55.558
Now, kids, don't
try this at home!

30:55.593 --> 30:58.231
Only Ogglies can eat that stuff!

31:00.598 --> 31:02.631
Mr. Gurnard, do something.

31:09.606 --> 31:11.507
Hmm, where is everyone?

31:14.743 --> 31:15.577
Oh.

31:17.811 --> 31:19.151
Hmm.

31:24.686 --> 31:26.554
Enchanting, isn't it?

31:28.194 --> 31:30.392
Ho-ho, delightful!

31:30.427 --> 31:32.361
This town is really special.

31:32.396 --> 31:33.230
Aye.

31:34.101 --> 31:35.100
Excuse me.

31:35.828 --> 31:39.368
Ah, an Ogglian
day to you, sir.

31:39.403 --> 31:41.369
Are you aliens?

31:41.404 --> 31:42.766
Oh no, of course not.

31:42.801 --> 31:45.571
Aliens only land in
America.

31:45.606 --> 31:47.573
Everybody knows
that, young man.

31:47.608 --> 31:49.806
Sure they do!

31:49.841 --> 31:51.643
I told you so!

31:51.678 --> 31:53.545
Yeah, we're Ogglies.

31:53.580 --> 31:54.678
Ogglies?

31:54.713 --> 31:55.712
- Ogglies?
- Ogglies?

31:57.155 --> 31:59.188
They're just Ogglies.

31:59.223 --> 32:01.652
I'm gonna go finish my nap.

32:01.687 --> 32:03.456
Get out of it, you scaredy cats!

32:06.757 --> 32:10.231
But the dragon's in
a no parking zone!

32:11.663 --> 32:15.434
Well, he didn't
tell us to clear off.

32:16.898 --> 32:20.075
Come on, Oggly Baby
needs some proper food.

32:30.416 --> 32:31.679
Madonna!

32:31.714 --> 32:33.648
A nice way to travel.

32:33.683 --> 32:35.683
Dragons? You can get
them on the Internet.

32:35.718 --> 32:37.124
Made in China.

32:39.689 --> 32:41.622
Hmm, what's
taking him so long?

32:41.657 --> 32:42.689
Hmm.

32:44.858 --> 32:46.726
I can't open the door!

32:46.761 --> 32:48.497
Hmm.

32:48.532 --> 32:49.366
Hm.

32:52.304 --> 32:53.105
What?

32:54.768 --> 32:56.603
I've found something.

32:57.804 --> 33:00.772
It's the exact the
same plan my mom has.

33:01.742 --> 33:04.115
This is a wellness temple?

33:05.547 --> 33:08.251
What's a wellness temple?

33:08.286 --> 33:12.123
There's no point asking
a boy that question.

33:17.657 --> 33:19.393
Just relax.

33:19.428 --> 33:22.165
Let your stress wash
away as we clean you-

33:22.200 --> 33:23.397
- Ugh!

33:23.432 --> 33:24.497
inside and out.

33:24.532 --> 33:25.762
Ugh!

33:25.797 --> 33:27.434
- Ugh!
- Bathe in our infinity pool,

33:27.469 --> 33:28.467
eat only the freshest-

33:29.437 --> 33:30.436
natural ingredients.

33:30.471 --> 33:31.800
Stop it!

33:31.835 --> 33:32.867
You'll feel reborn-

33:32.902 --> 33:34.176
- I can't take any more!

33:34.211 --> 33:35.573
Refreshed.

33:35.608 --> 33:37.179
Well, whatever it is,
the most important thing

33:37.214 --> 33:40.940
is that it's gonna be
being built on the dump.

33:40.975 --> 33:42.678
Starting today.

33:55.230 --> 34:00.233
Right, men, let's make room
for her highness' temple.

34:15.810 --> 34:16.873
All right.

34:23.850 --> 34:25.685
Rat tails and fly juice!

34:25.719 --> 34:26.851
My mud shower works!

34:26.886 --> 34:27.719
Oggly!

34:28.853 --> 34:29.786
Uh, boss?

34:31.857 --> 34:32.790
What the?

34:34.266 --> 34:35.826
Lunch time!

34:35.860 --> 34:37.366
Coming!

34:37.400 --> 34:38.763
Are those aliens?

34:40.271 --> 34:42.370
Nah, must be Halloween.

34:42.405 --> 34:44.735
It certainly looks
like they live here.

34:50.809 --> 34:53.248
Mmm!

34:53.283 --> 34:56.911
Mashed slipper gratine
and barbed wire salad

34:56.946 --> 34:58.979
with bleach dressing!

35:03.887 --> 35:06.359
Has anyone seen the kids?

35:06.394 --> 35:09.263
Oh, I expect
they're having fun

35:09.298 --> 35:10.759
with Lotta and Max.

35:13.863 --> 35:15.368
What is it?

35:15.403 --> 35:16.929
Hmm, I don't know.

35:16.964 --> 35:19.800
Our cave isn't even
properly Ogglyian yet.

35:20.770 --> 35:21.703
- Hm?
- Hm?

35:22.673 --> 35:24.376
All right, listen up.

35:24.411 --> 35:27.280
I don't care if they're
aliens or cosplay fans.

35:27.315 --> 35:31.547
These freaks have chosen the
wrong place to dig their hole.

35:33.815 --> 35:36.948
Slimy swamps and
cheesy feet, visitors!

35:36.983 --> 35:38.686
Please, come in.

35:40.722 --> 35:44.592
You heard her, men.

35:45.463 --> 35:47.562
Let's do it, come on!

35:47.597 --> 35:48.728
Mm, okay.

35:48.763 --> 35:49.861
Aw! Oh.

35:51.897 --> 35:52.731
Yeah.

35:59.872 --> 36:02.345
Oh, duck spit
and dandruff piles!

36:02.380 --> 36:04.907
We haven't even
introduced ourselves.

36:04.942 --> 36:06.645
My name's Oggly Dad.

36:06.680 --> 36:07.481
And you are?

36:10.013 --> 36:10.946
Damn!

36:10.981 --> 36:11.815
Nice name.

36:16.689 --> 36:17.919
We're done, boss.

36:17.954 --> 36:19.822
Okay, move out, men.

36:21.628 --> 36:25.058
And if you are still here
tomorrow, we'll be back.

36:25.093 --> 36:27.961
And then things will get ugly!

36:28.865 --> 36:29.864
Toodles!

36:29.899 --> 36:31.437
Anytime!

36:31.472 --> 36:32.834
Good bye!

36:41.877 --> 36:44.383
Hmm, what are
you grinning about?

36:44.418 --> 36:45.978
Hmm, moldy maggots!

36:46.948 --> 36:49.421
Now, the cave's perfect!

36:49.456 --> 36:50.917
Thank you, Mr. Damn!

36:54.955 --> 36:56.856
Whoa!

36:58.959 --> 37:00.893
Oh no, they've
already started.

37:01.698 --> 37:02.730
Hang on.

37:02.765 --> 37:04.401
Looks like they're leaving.

37:04.436 --> 37:07.096
You head back, I've got
things to take care of!

37:23.850 --> 37:24.981
They wanna build a temple!

37:25.016 --> 37:27.115
Right here on the dump!

37:28.458 --> 37:29.391
A temple?

37:30.559 --> 37:32.559
Well, maybe they
love garbage so much

37:32.594 --> 37:33.890
they wanna worship it.

37:33.925 --> 37:36.156
No, they wanna get rid of it.

37:36.191 --> 37:36.992
All of it!

37:37.027 --> 37:38.532
Who does?

37:38.567 --> 37:40.995
Hammer. The guy
who was just here!

37:41.030 --> 37:42.568
They start today!

37:42.603 --> 37:44.669
Slimy socks, children.

37:44.704 --> 37:47.540
Firstly, nothing's gonna
be built here today,

37:47.575 --> 37:49.036
as you can see.

37:49.071 --> 37:52.038
Secondly, that delightful
man is called Mr. Damn.

37:52.073 --> 37:53.875
Huh?

37:53.910 --> 37:57.516
And thirdly, he's just helped
us decorate the new cave.

37:57.551 --> 37:59.980
So then we don't
have to leave again?

38:00.015 --> 38:02.950
Maggoty mud socks,
of course, not.

38:04.590 --> 38:07.921
Don't worry about
it, kids, go and play!

38:10.090 --> 38:10.924
Huh?

38:13.830 --> 38:16.830
Did those guys look like
they came to help decorate?

38:16.865 --> 38:19.063
Nope and the shouty guy

38:19.098 --> 38:22.066
is definitely called
Hammer, not Damn.

38:23.641 --> 38:25.135
He's had more
construction scandals

38:25.170 --> 38:27.104
than my uncle's got test tubes.

38:27.139 --> 38:28.742
Huh?

38:28.777 --> 38:29.809
There's stuff here
about the concert hall

38:29.844 --> 38:30.975
and a German airport.

38:31.010 --> 38:32.482
Never finished.

38:32.517 --> 38:34.044
So it's true.

38:34.079 --> 38:35.650
We will have to leave again.

38:35.685 --> 38:36.948
That's not fair!

38:36.983 --> 38:39.621
We never do anything wrong.

38:39.656 --> 38:41.457
But that doesn't matter.

38:41.492 --> 38:44.185
People say we're
weird or we smell bad.

38:44.220 --> 38:48.156
And some people say
we're just too green.

38:50.061 --> 38:52.995
And then they
tell us to scram.

38:55.197 --> 38:57.571
But I'm sure together,

38:57.606 --> 39:01.003
we can stop that from
happening this time.

39:02.138 --> 39:02.972
How?

39:03.873 --> 39:07.008
Hammer is obviously
up to something.

39:08.176 --> 39:11.078
Let's follow him
and find out what!

39:11.113 --> 39:14.554
Does he seem a
little odd to you?

39:14.589 --> 39:18.018
Never mind, it's
definitely a heroic idea.

39:18.053 --> 39:22.825
But Hammer's gone, how do
you plan on finding him now?

39:22.860 --> 39:25.927
Let's play fetch
with Firebottom.

39:25.962 --> 39:30.161
Uh, does this dragon
have any seat belts?

39:39.908 --> 39:40.540
Whoa!

39:42.944 --> 39:46.044
Mommy, dragon, dragon, dragon!

39:46.079 --> 39:47.683
I know, darling.

39:47.718 --> 39:49.916
Just one more email
and I'll take a look.

39:53.954 --> 39:55.921
Round one, you win!

40:19.241 --> 40:20.779
I can't believe it!

40:20.814 --> 40:23.012
My plan was perfect!

40:24.279 --> 40:25.311
Huh?

40:25.346 --> 40:26.180
What?

40:28.854 --> 40:29.688
No.

40:44.297 --> 40:46.033
No, damn!

40:46.068 --> 40:50.235
Now, I can spend months
arguing with conservationists!

40:52.271 --> 40:53.743
Huh?

40:53.778 --> 40:56.911
For a fresh and
beautiful Smelliville?

40:56.946 --> 40:59.276
Come to participate
in your towns future?

41:00.279 --> 41:01.113
You fool!

41:03.150 --> 41:04.049
No, genius!

41:11.256 --> 41:12.123
No!

41:12.158 --> 41:13.256
Yes!

41:13.291 --> 41:14.323
Ogglies?

41:14.358 --> 41:16.159
Little green creatures

41:16.194 --> 41:18.997
and they're living
on the rubbish dump!

41:19.032 --> 41:21.197
I can't hear anything.

41:21.232 --> 41:23.298
Your mother's saying that
she thought you were crazy

41:23.333 --> 41:26.301
when you told her
about the green people.

41:26.336 --> 41:27.807
You can hear her?

41:27.842 --> 41:29.303
Hearing horns.

41:29.338 --> 41:32.108
With these, we can
hear an earthworm hiccup.

41:32.143 --> 41:34.143
Whoa, earthworms hiccup?

41:35.278 --> 41:36.783
And what do we do now?

41:36.818 --> 41:38.983
Unless you want
to spend months

41:39.018 --> 41:42.018
arguing with conservationists,

41:42.053 --> 41:44.658
I'd suggest a citizen's meeting.

41:44.693 --> 41:46.253
A citizen's meeting?

41:47.696 --> 41:50.026
Mr. Hammer suggested
a citizen's meeting.

41:50.061 --> 41:54.865
And your mother said, "A
citizens meeting?"

41:54.900 --> 41:59.870
Yes, and Lady Mayoress, the
Ogglies have to be involved.

42:01.071 --> 42:02.235
What's on earth's
gotten into you?

42:02.270 --> 42:04.170
A meeting with the Ogglies?

42:04.205 --> 42:08.273
Yes, they seem like lovely
little creatures.

42:08.308 --> 42:13.179
We can't just bulldoze
the whole thing, can we?

42:15.315 --> 42:17.347
Ah, fine, whatever you think.

42:17.382 --> 42:19.250
There isn't time
to argue about it.

42:19.285 --> 42:21.351
Oh, chin up, Lady Mayoress.

42:21.386 --> 42:24.354
Tomorrow will be a great
day for Smelliville!

42:24.389 --> 42:25.696
You'll see.

42:25.731 --> 42:26.356
Toodle-oo!

42:29.129 --> 42:31.734
I need anti-stress drops now.

42:34.299 --> 42:35.364
Oh no, empty.

42:36.741 --> 42:39.335
Oh, a perfect end
to a perfect day.

42:41.239 --> 42:44.240
Mr. Hammer was actually
being pretty nice.

42:44.275 --> 42:46.308
Yeah, just like Dad said.

42:52.854 --> 42:55.052
I don't trust him.

42:55.087 --> 42:58.385
He's definitely up to something.

43:06.064 --> 43:08.394
My mom is gonna go check on me!

43:10.068 --> 43:12.233
Hmm, someone's been busy.

43:12.268 --> 43:14.301
Yep, almost done.

43:14.336 --> 43:18.744
Just wrapping up
German.

43:26.479 --> 43:28.049
Hm.

43:32.088 --> 43:34.088
That rubbish dump reeks!

43:36.356 --> 43:37.795
Yeah.

43:37.830 --> 43:38.763
Oh, what!

43:39.930 --> 43:41.457
It's the mayorette.

43:41.492 --> 43:45.032
I mean the lady mayoress,
I mean the mayor's wife!

43:46.002 --> 43:47.001
Wonderful!

43:47.036 --> 43:48.365
I'm on my way, oh!

43:50.072 --> 43:52.467
I'm sorry, Max, an
important appointment.

43:52.502 --> 43:54.469
I'll test you when
I get back, okay?

43:54.504 --> 43:57.109
And clean up your room, darling!

43:57.144 --> 43:58.847
Tidy room, tidy mind!

44:00.279 --> 44:01.476
That was close.

44:01.511 --> 44:03.049
Can you tell your parents

44:03.084 --> 44:04.852
about the citizen's
meeting tomorrow?

44:04.887 --> 44:05.919
They'll be knocked off

44:05.954 --> 44:07.481
their smelly feet!

44:16.557 --> 44:18.194
See you tomorrow
at the meeting!

44:18.229 --> 44:20.801
Stay warty!

44:27.271 --> 44:28.973
Hmm, that's correct.

44:30.405 --> 44:31.239
Hm, yes.

44:33.243 --> 44:34.913
That's right, mm-hm.

44:36.114 --> 44:36.948
Mm-hm.

44:37.951 --> 44:39.280
Oh, what's that?

44:40.953 --> 44:43.019
Oh, what have we here?

44:43.054 --> 44:44.053
Oh!

44:47.256 --> 44:48.959
Ha-ha!

44:48.994 --> 44:52.060
Ooh, this must be the
essence from Oggly Grandma

44:52.095 --> 44:54.524
after the De-Stinkomat
sucked her up!

44:54.559 --> 44:57.395
That means the
De-Stinkomat works!

44:59.201 --> 45:03.038
Yes, shackashacka boom,
shacka boom, oh yes!

45:03.073 --> 45:05.369
And the Nobel Prize goes to-

45:07.472 --> 45:08.977
Huh?

45:09.012 --> 45:09.846
Hmm.

45:14.182 --> 45:15.477
Ah, Lady Mayor-

45:15.512 --> 45:16.412
- Ssh!

45:16.447 --> 45:17.281
Hm?

45:23.223 --> 45:25.520
You said my anti-stress
drops were ready?

45:25.555 --> 45:26.554
Of course.

45:28.392 --> 45:30.458
Have you met the new inhabitants
of the rubbish dump yet?

45:30.493 --> 45:31.591
The Ogglies?

45:31.626 --> 45:34.165
No, and I don't intend to.

45:35.036 --> 45:36.365
Maybe you should.

45:36.400 --> 45:39.038
Then you'd see that
they eat rubbish.

45:41.305 --> 45:42.535
Oh no!

45:42.570 --> 45:43.569
Oh yes!

45:43.604 --> 45:45.813
They're made for it, look!

45:48.884 --> 45:50.312
Oh, delightful!

45:51.380 --> 45:53.314
I've taken measurements

45:53.349 --> 45:56.482
which show that the town
stinks much less now!

45:56.517 --> 46:00.552
And you believe anything
this toy is telling you?

46:00.587 --> 46:04.456
This toy, Lady Mayoress, is
a great piece of engineering,

46:04.491 --> 46:05.930
made by your son!

46:07.230 --> 46:08.031
Huh?

46:09.562 --> 46:11.034
Max built this?

46:12.598 --> 46:15.400
Max helped build all of this!

46:15.435 --> 46:17.072
Rather fabulous, isn't it?

46:17.107 --> 46:19.107
He's a very talented boy.

46:27.545 --> 46:31.250
As I was saying,
it's 14% less smelly

46:32.484 --> 46:34.385
and the amount of
rubbish at the dump

46:34.420 --> 46:38.290
has fallen dramatically
since the Ogglies arrived!

46:38.325 --> 46:39.895
Don't you see?

46:39.930 --> 46:42.293
The Ogglies can save the
town just by being here!

46:42.328 --> 46:45.263
If I hear the word

46:45.298 --> 46:47.364
og, sorry, one more time!

46:52.700 --> 46:55.602
This conversation never
took place.

46:55.637 --> 46:56.977
And I was never here.

46:57.012 --> 46:59.210
Right.

46:59.245 --> 47:02.477
Ah, good
afternoon, Lady Mayoress.

47:07.681 --> 47:10.550
Farting flies, home at last!

47:11.718 --> 47:13.157
Where are my...

47:22.530 --> 47:23.628
Hi, Mom.

47:23.663 --> 47:25.630
I wanted to talk to you.

47:27.534 --> 47:29.336
Me too.

47:29.371 --> 47:31.041
I heard that you're meeting
with the Ogglies tomorrow

47:31.076 --> 47:32.570
so you can make arrangements
for them to stay.

47:32.605 --> 47:34.572
Wait, wait, wait!

47:34.607 --> 47:36.145
Stay?

47:36.180 --> 47:37.575
No, Max.

47:37.610 --> 47:39.510
We're going to tell them
they have to go home.

47:39.545 --> 47:41.644
But this is their home.

47:41.679 --> 47:43.712
And the Ogglies
could really help us.

47:43.747 --> 47:45.351
Enough!

47:45.386 --> 47:47.320
The only thing that
will help Smelliville

47:47.355 --> 47:51.060
is my wellness temple
with its aroma mud baths

47:51.095 --> 47:53.127
in relaxing surroundings.

47:53.162 --> 47:54.964
And certainly, not a stinky dump

47:54.999 --> 47:59.133
with a collection of stinking
Ogglies on our doorstep!

47:59.168 --> 48:01.201
But where are they
supposed to live

48:01.236 --> 48:03.235
if everyone keeps
driving them away?

48:03.270 --> 48:05.270
Well,
not on my rubbish dump!

48:05.305 --> 48:06.601
That's not fair!

48:06.636 --> 48:08.372
You should try putting yourself

48:08.407 --> 48:11.078
in the Ogglies' shoes for a day.

48:12.609 --> 48:17.545
Oh, you should try putting
yourself in my shoes for a day.

48:19.087 --> 48:20.086
Both of you.

48:37.599 --> 48:38.433
Oh, warty!

48:49.676 --> 48:51.675
Crazy Incorporated, what's up?

48:51.710 --> 48:53.116
They messed with us!

48:53.151 --> 48:54.744
They still want
the Ogglies gone!

48:54.779 --> 48:56.317
What do you mean?

48:56.352 --> 48:58.748
The citizen's meeting,
it's all a set up.

48:58.783 --> 49:00.717
They're gonna tell
the Ogglies to leave!

49:00.752 --> 49:02.587
Adults are so sneaky.

49:04.788 --> 49:05.589
It's over.

49:06.790 --> 49:09.263
My mom will never listen.

49:09.298 --> 49:12.761
Hm, maybe I have to
organize something really loud

49:12.796 --> 49:14.466
to make them listen.

49:16.139 --> 49:18.601
And what would a hero do, hmm?

49:21.144 --> 49:21.769
Uh.

49:24.246 --> 49:25.146
Aha!

49:30.548 --> 49:34.319
Maybe we have to play
them at their own game.

49:50.303 --> 49:52.632
Hmm, a fart for
your thoughts, dear.

49:52.667 --> 49:55.602
The children are all excited
about the meeting tomorrow

49:55.637 --> 49:59.804
but now, I'm starting to worry
if everything will work out.

49:59.839 --> 50:03.213
Ah, they'll be heartbroken
if we have to leave again.

50:03.248 --> 50:07.745
Oh, my little stinky sock,
that isn't very Oggly, is it?

50:07.780 --> 50:08.614
Hm.

50:09.881 --> 50:11.782
Just look at this view.

50:13.654 --> 50:18.359
And remember, an Oggly worries
about tomorrow, tomorrow.

50:33.441 --> 50:34.275
Mm-hm.

50:45.551 --> 50:47.254
This had better work.

51:02.501 --> 51:03.334
What?

51:09.672 --> 51:12.607
Yummy,
yummy, slimy old banana skin!

51:15.809 --> 51:18.876
Old coffee filters
and rotten yogurt!

51:20.616 --> 51:21.615
Uh, hello?

51:35.861 --> 51:37.201
What's going on?

51:58.486 --> 52:00.717
Where did the Oggly go?

52:06.889 --> 52:07.954
What?

52:14.336 --> 52:16.830
Cheesy fly farts,
freshly washed!

52:18.405 --> 52:19.239
Oh, oh!

52:21.243 --> 52:22.836
The rubbish dump!

52:48.664 --> 52:53.336
An all you can eat
buffet!

53:25.434 --> 53:27.532
What is it doing?

53:45.012 --> 53:45.846
What?

53:50.083 --> 53:51.917
What on earth is that?

53:54.328 --> 53:57.021
The alarm is set for 12 noon.

53:57.056 --> 53:58.891
But what happens then?

54:00.961 --> 54:03.796
Then
kid, it goes boom!

54:07.769 --> 54:09.901
Ah, I'll call you back.

54:19.846 --> 54:21.417
Everything sorted?

54:21.452 --> 54:23.617
Tomorrow, during
the citizens meeting,

54:23.652 --> 54:26.554
the bomb goes up and there
won't be a rubbish dump

54:26.589 --> 54:28.720
for the Ogglies to go back to.

54:28.755 --> 54:31.591
The tarp will be filled
with high explosive gas

54:31.626 --> 54:34.363
and at noon, the alarm
will go off and it will-

54:34.398 --> 54:35.826
- Yes, yes, yes, fascinating.

54:35.861 --> 54:37.696
And nobody can trace
this back to me?

54:37.731 --> 54:39.026
Of course not, boss.

54:39.061 --> 54:39.961
Good work.

54:39.996 --> 54:41.028
- Hey!
- Huh?

54:41.063 --> 54:42.799
Let me out of here!

54:42.834 --> 54:44.064
What the?

54:44.099 --> 54:45.901
What have you done,
you nincompoop?

54:45.936 --> 54:49.542
I didn't know what to do,
he appeared from nowhere!

54:51.039 --> 54:52.841
I'm gonna tell my parents!

54:52.876 --> 54:54.513
My father is a mayor.

55:00.389 --> 55:01.652
Give that back!

55:05.987 --> 55:07.987
- You can't keep me in here!
- What are we gonna do

55:08.022 --> 55:08.922
with him, boss?

55:08.957 --> 55:10.022
Take him back home?

55:10.057 --> 55:11.364
No, no, not yet. Stay calm.

55:11.399 --> 55:12.893
The boy doesn't know who we are.

55:12.928 --> 55:15.059
Keep him in the van
until everything is over.

55:15.094 --> 55:17.963
You only let him go
when I give the word.

55:17.998 --> 55:19.800
I'll take care of the mayoress.

55:19.835 --> 55:20.834
Let me out!

55:20.869 --> 55:22.935
My mom is looking for me!

55:22.970 --> 55:25.971
I doubt that, otherwise all
hell would've broken loose.

55:26.006 --> 55:26.971
Believe me.

55:31.978 --> 55:34.451
Please don't do
anything to the Ogglies!

55:34.486 --> 55:35.782
Please!

55:35.817 --> 55:38.554
They haven't done you any harm!

55:39.853 --> 55:40.885
Great.

55:40.920 --> 55:42.722
What am I gonna do now?

55:54.196 --> 55:56.999
Farting flies
and burping bees.

56:04.073 --> 56:07.448
Holy muckchuck, at
this time of night?

56:12.114 --> 56:15.081
Toodley up toodoo, breakfast!

56:15.116 --> 56:16.951
Now?

56:16.986 --> 56:21.087
Well, best time of the day
for it, your worshipfulness!

56:21.122 --> 56:23.727
Any special developments?

56:23.762 --> 56:26.795
Apart from feeling like
I spent the whole night

56:26.830 --> 56:28.467
eating rubbish?

56:28.502 --> 56:29.831
Nothing.

56:29.866 --> 56:31.833
Shall we go to your office?

56:31.868 --> 56:33.967
We'll only wake Max
here in the hall.

56:34.002 --> 56:35.573
You're right.

56:35.608 --> 56:38.773
Farting flies, there's
a lot to be done!

56:40.546 --> 56:42.777
- What?
- I'll be right out!

56:46.519 --> 56:47.782
What?

56:47.817 --> 56:49.113
How?

56:54.922 --> 56:56.658
Lady Mayoress,
we've got a lot to do!

56:56.693 --> 56:59.089
Coming!

57:11.509 --> 57:15.070
Yeah, all hell has broken
loose in Smelliville.

57:15.105 --> 57:17.072
The site for Smelliville's
new wellness temple

57:17.107 --> 57:19.481
was planned to be
the old rubbish dump.

57:19.516 --> 57:20.878
But the whole project-

57:20.913 --> 57:22.814
- Is now in jeopardy due
to some new inhabitants

57:22.849 --> 57:25.014
standing quite
literally in the way.

57:25.049 --> 57:27.851
The so-called Ogglies have
made the dump their new home.

57:27.886 --> 57:30.150
The mayoress has called an
urgent citizen's meeting

57:30.185 --> 57:31.591
for 12 o'clock.

57:31.626 --> 57:32.526
Everyone is invited.

57:32.561 --> 57:34.495
Including the Ogglies!

57:34.530 --> 57:36.959
In other news, police
are on the hunt for vandals

57:36.994 --> 57:38.532
who left a trail of rubbish

57:38.566 --> 57:41.666
and half-eaten washing
across town last night.

57:41.701 --> 57:44.229
Could there be a
connection to the Ogglies?

57:44.264 --> 57:45.571
Oh, here they come!

57:45.606 --> 57:46.836
There they are.

57:46.871 --> 57:48.101
Hey!

57:48.136 --> 57:49.938
Hey, excuse me.

57:49.973 --> 57:51.708
Excuse me, is this seat free?

57:51.743 --> 57:52.676
Oh!

57:52.711 --> 57:53.710
It is now.

57:55.307 --> 57:57.010
That's most Ogglian of you.

57:57.045 --> 57:58.077
Newty!

57:58.112 --> 58:00.915
Seats of honor!

58:00.950 --> 58:03.818
She looks like she could
do with a bit of wellness.

58:11.696 --> 58:13.223
Yeah.

58:13.258 --> 58:15.224
Oh, hello Mr. Damn!

58:15.259 --> 58:17.666
Hey, Mr. Damn, don't
forget to pay us a visit

58:17.701 --> 58:21.263
like you promised!

58:21.298 --> 58:23.705
Yeah, they ate my new socks!

58:23.740 --> 58:25.839
We wouldn't touch new socks!

58:25.874 --> 58:27.301
The older the better!

58:28.172 --> 58:29.138
Ew!

58:29.173 --> 58:30.007
Ugh!

58:31.615 --> 58:32.240
Hm?

58:36.587 --> 58:37.212
Huh?

58:41.657 --> 58:42.887
I need to pee!

58:42.922 --> 58:44.757
No one's stopping
you.

58:44.792 --> 58:46.594
Ha-ha, very funny.

58:46.629 --> 58:50.257
I don't think you realize
how much trouble you're in!

58:50.292 --> 58:51.994
Come on!

58:52.029 --> 58:54.799
Ah, can't a guy just
drink his coffee in peace?

58:55.670 --> 58:58.231
Huh?

58:58.266 --> 58:59.771
Oh!

58:59.806 --> 59:01.267
Yeah, boss, everything
under control.

59:01.302 --> 59:03.235
You
said there'd be nothing

59:03.270 --> 59:05.171
that could lead back to me!

59:05.206 --> 59:06.205
Huh?

59:06.240 --> 59:07.580
Oh!

59:07.615 --> 59:09.307
Boss, I had to improvise.

59:09.342 --> 59:11.683
I only had a gas
cylinder and a tarp and-

59:11.718 --> 59:13.179
- Get rid of it!

59:13.214 --> 59:15.686
Or we'll all end up in jail!

59:15.721 --> 59:17.215
Huh?

59:17.250 --> 59:18.249
Yes, boss!

59:18.284 --> 59:19.987
I'm on my way, boss!

59:21.760 --> 59:22.726
Yes!

59:29.228 --> 59:30.227
Oh!

59:35.201 --> 59:36.607
Whoa!

59:36.642 --> 59:37.234
Oh.

59:39.138 --> 59:39.972
Oh no.

59:54.218 --> 59:55.052
Huh?

59:56.286 --> 59:57.626
Whoa!

59:57.661 --> 59:58.891
Whoa!

59:58.926 --> 01:00:01.630
Whoa, slime balls
and swamp rats!

01:00:01.665 --> 01:00:04.060
Has Dad been tinkering again?

01:00:08.836 --> 01:00:09.769
Huh?

01:00:09.804 --> 01:00:11.265
Slow down, oh!

01:00:13.269 --> 01:00:15.037
Wait, was that?

01:00:15.072 --> 01:00:16.335
Max!

01:00:22.277 --> 01:00:23.111
Oh no!

01:00:34.387 --> 01:00:35.859
Oh, my.

01:00:35.894 --> 01:00:37.256
Max!

01:00:37.291 --> 01:00:38.960
Hammer wants to blow
up the rubbish dump!

01:00:38.995 --> 01:00:41.226
Oh, where is that darn thing?

01:00:41.261 --> 01:00:42.029
Ah!

01:00:43.461 --> 01:00:45.329
There, that's a bomb!

01:00:49.874 --> 01:00:51.301
Stop it right there!

01:00:52.942 --> 01:00:56.944
Don't worry kids, the
danger's over!

01:00:56.979 --> 01:00:57.780
Huh?

01:01:02.050 --> 01:01:05.314
Oh, no, you wouldn't
do that, would you?

01:01:11.487 --> 01:01:13.091
That figures.

01:01:26.105 --> 01:01:29.006
Could I ask for quiet, please?

01:01:29.041 --> 01:01:30.711
Oh, hi, mate.

01:01:30.746 --> 01:01:34.077
Farting flies and
burping bees, quiet!

01:01:36.444 --> 01:01:37.344
Thank you.

01:01:38.885 --> 01:01:42.414
My fellow citizens, I'm
sure you've all heard by now

01:01:42.449 --> 01:01:47.023
about my wonderful plan to
build a wellness temple in town.

01:01:55.494 --> 01:01:56.999
Huh?

01:01:57.034 --> 01:01:59.034
But it can't be built anymore!

01:01:59.069 --> 01:02:00.739
Because they live in the way!

01:02:00.774 --> 01:02:01.740
Yeah!

01:02:01.775 --> 01:02:03.466
They live in the way!

01:02:05.107 --> 01:02:07.041
But we're not in anyone's way.

01:02:07.076 --> 01:02:09.010
We live in the rubbish dump.

01:02:09.045 --> 01:02:10.979
Exactly!

01:02:11.014 --> 01:02:12.475
I'm here to tell you now.

01:02:12.510 --> 01:02:16.115
The wellness temple will
be built as planned!

01:02:17.789 --> 01:02:18.513
On the rubbish dump!

01:02:18.548 --> 01:02:19.888
What?

01:02:22.486 --> 01:02:25.861
May I present,
Smelliville's future.

01:02:29.459 --> 01:02:30.458
Huh?

01:02:30.493 --> 01:02:31.800
What?

01:02:31.835 --> 01:02:32.999
Huh?

01:02:33.034 --> 01:02:34.429
What's the matter?

01:02:35.498 --> 01:02:36.431
Huh?

01:02:37.841 --> 01:02:38.465
What?

01:02:44.946 --> 01:02:46.209
I...

01:02:46.244 --> 01:02:47.540
Oh!

01:02:47.575 --> 01:02:48.409
Oh!

01:02:49.511 --> 01:02:51.015
Ooh!

01:02:51.050 --> 01:02:51.884
Uh.

01:02:55.450 --> 01:02:56.251
Uh.

01:03:00.422 --> 01:03:02.289
My anti-stress drops.

01:03:04.326 --> 01:03:05.160
Oh no!

01:03:14.841 --> 01:03:16.368
What the?

01:03:16.403 --> 01:03:19.503
Ah, I must've given
her the Oggly essence!

01:03:19.538 --> 01:03:22.880
Cheesy fly farts,
in all my 985 years,

01:03:24.015 --> 01:03:28.819
I've never seen anything
like that!

01:03:29.547 --> 01:03:30.579
She's one of them!

01:03:30.614 --> 01:03:32.383
This is a conspiracy!

01:03:33.353 --> 01:03:34.385
Them?

01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:36.453
What are you talking about?

01:03:38.896 --> 01:03:41.127
What on earth is going on?

01:03:41.162 --> 01:03:42.832
An Oggly invasion!

01:03:48.202 --> 01:03:49.399
Oh, mamma mia!

01:03:49.434 --> 01:03:51.004
Go with your Ogglies!

01:03:51.039 --> 01:03:52.038
You leave her alone!

01:03:52.073 --> 01:03:53.369
My Ogglies?

01:03:53.404 --> 01:03:55.602
By my steaming snot rag!

01:03:55.637 --> 01:03:56.570
Now, look here!

01:03:56.605 --> 01:03:58.880
My son, Max, he-

01:03:58.915 --> 01:04:00.409
- Outrageous!

01:04:00.444 --> 01:04:02.179
She's blaming her son!

01:04:03.050 --> 01:04:03.884
I think we should go.

01:04:05.954 --> 01:04:07.184
Huh?

01:04:07.219 --> 01:04:08.284
Huh?

01:04:08.319 --> 01:04:10.484
Mission accomplished, boss.

01:04:11.993 --> 01:04:12.827
Huh?

01:04:14.258 --> 01:04:15.862
The Ogglies
are most welcome here!

01:04:15.897 --> 01:04:18.326
Cabbage crisps and beetle beer!

01:04:18.361 --> 01:04:20.559
The Ogglies are
most welcome here!

01:04:20.594 --> 01:04:22.869
Cabbage crisps and beetle beer!

01:04:22.904 --> 01:04:25.003
The Ogglies are
most welcome here!

01:04:25.038 --> 01:04:27.532
Cabbage crisps and beetle beer!

01:04:27.567 --> 01:04:29.875
The Ogglies are
most welcome here!

01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:32.075
Did you organize
this demonstration?

01:04:32.110 --> 01:04:33.637
Yes, me and my friends!

01:04:33.672 --> 01:04:35.573
And why are you demonstrating?

01:04:35.608 --> 01:04:38.476
People need to realize that
Smelliville needs the Ogglies,

01:04:38.511 --> 01:04:40.511
and the Ogglies
need Smelliville!

01:04:40.546 --> 01:04:43.184
They're the best recyclers
in the whole world!

01:04:43.219 --> 01:04:45.285
Wellness
in, Ogglies out!

01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:47.518
Wellness in, Ogglies out!

01:04:47.553 --> 01:04:49.927
Wellness in, Ogglies out!

01:04:49.962 --> 01:04:50.652
Wellness!

01:04:58.662 --> 01:05:01.366
Oh dear, how are we
going to explain all this

01:05:01.401 --> 01:05:02.432
to the children?

01:05:02.467 --> 01:05:03.400
Oh, gosh!

01:05:03.435 --> 01:05:05.039
What?

01:05:05.074 --> 01:05:07.437
What happened to Max's mother?

01:05:07.472 --> 01:05:10.341
Speaking of Max, where is he?

01:05:13.181 --> 01:05:14.608
Hmm.

01:05:14.643 --> 01:05:16.082
Aha!

01:05:16.117 --> 01:05:17.314
Uncle,
where are you going?

01:05:17.349 --> 01:05:18.414
To my laboratory!

01:05:18.449 --> 01:05:20.119
I've got to help the mayoress!

01:05:20.154 --> 01:05:23.650
Get to the dump as
fast as you can!

01:05:23.685 --> 01:05:25.091
Hmm.

01:05:34.068 --> 01:05:36.266
You lose!

01:05:36.301 --> 01:05:37.333
A dragon!

01:05:37.368 --> 01:05:39.202
Mm.

01:05:39.237 --> 01:05:40.698
Whatever.

01:05:49.709 --> 01:05:51.411
Here is the boss!

01:05:57.089 --> 01:05:59.683
Huh, he doesn't
give up, does he?

01:05:59.718 --> 01:06:01.619
I've had enough!

01:06:01.654 --> 01:06:03.257
You're construction workers!

01:06:03.292 --> 01:06:04.995
You deal with them!

01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:07.690
Or should I hire kindergarten
teachers instead?

01:06:07.725 --> 01:06:10.968
Boss, I always wanted to
be a kindergarten teacher.

01:06:11.003 --> 01:06:12.970
That is enough!

01:06:13.698 --> 01:06:15.565
Get them out!

01:06:39.061 --> 01:06:42.293
Play nice and nothing
bad's gonna happen to you!

01:06:42.328 --> 01:06:44.031
Yeah.

01:06:44.066 --> 01:06:45.593
Okay, we surrender.

01:06:47.498 --> 01:06:49.003
We
were leaving anyway.

01:06:49.038 --> 01:06:50.201
You win.

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:53.369
Huh?

01:06:53.404 --> 01:06:55.668
Eh, where's the baby got to?

01:06:58.772 --> 01:07:00.013
Aw!

01:07:03.446 --> 01:07:06.051
That's,
lovely, innit?

01:07:06.086 --> 01:07:07.712
Mm-mm!

01:07:07.747 --> 01:07:08.713
Huh?

01:07:15.127 --> 01:07:16.522
Huh, take that.

01:07:21.529 --> 01:07:23.265
Hey, stop, stop!

01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:25.201
Where are you going? Stop!

01:07:25.236 --> 01:07:26.564
Hey, what?

01:07:26.599 --> 01:07:28.104
What the?

01:07:30.306 --> 01:07:34.110
What did mom always say if
you want a job done properly?

01:07:34.145 --> 01:07:38.410
Then, you've got to do
it yourself.

01:07:50.489 --> 01:07:51.719
Out of the way!

01:07:52.623 --> 01:07:53.721
Never!

01:08:00.136 --> 01:08:04.764
It's gonna take more
than that.

01:08:08.407 --> 01:08:09.241
No!

01:08:11.542 --> 01:08:13.344
Children!

01:08:16.447 --> 01:08:17.611
Whoa!

01:08:19.318 --> 01:08:21.648
Huh, a dragon!

01:08:21.683 --> 01:08:24.585
Gotta hand it to them, Ogglies
travel in style.

01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:26.189
- No!
- Put us down!

01:08:26.225 --> 01:08:28.258
- No, let me go!
- No, we've got to stop him!

01:08:28.292 --> 01:08:30.854
Have you gone
completely boggly?

01:08:30.889 --> 01:08:33.229
That rat wanted to
blow up the rubbish dump

01:08:33.265 --> 01:08:36.134
while everyone was
at the town hall!

01:08:36.169 --> 01:08:37.795
What?

01:08:37.830 --> 01:08:40.863
But Max found the bomb and
he was kidnapped by Hammer!

01:08:40.898 --> 01:08:42.667
I beg your pardon?

01:08:42.702 --> 01:08:44.273
It's true, Mom!

01:08:44.308 --> 01:08:46.506
And now, he wants to
destroy their home!

01:08:47.377 --> 01:08:48.541
Mom! You look-

01:08:49.609 --> 01:08:50.805
- Really angry!

01:08:52.479 --> 01:08:54.546
Wait here, my little inventor.

01:08:54.581 --> 01:08:55.415
What?

01:09:00.785 --> 01:09:02.618
You tricked me,
you rotten rat!

01:09:02.654 --> 01:09:03.455
Huh?

01:09:04.392 --> 01:09:07.689
You planted a bomb in my town!

01:09:12.796 --> 01:09:15.367
And you dared to kidnap my son!

01:09:21.176 --> 01:09:22.143
Mom!

01:09:25.544 --> 01:09:27.279
I'll take care of you!

01:09:27.314 --> 01:09:28.148
Huh?

01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:36.255
What the?

01:09:37.850 --> 01:09:38.783
Oh.

01:09:52.865 --> 01:09:53.863
Uh, um, I...

01:09:56.572 --> 01:09:57.934
Huh?

01:09:57.969 --> 01:10:00.673
I've only got one
thing to say to you.

01:10:00.708 --> 01:10:02.377
You do? What?

01:10:20.891 --> 01:10:21.890
Mom!

01:10:21.925 --> 01:10:22.957
Max!

01:10:22.992 --> 01:10:25.926
Oh, thank goodness, you're okay!

01:10:25.961 --> 01:10:27.334
And thank you!

01:10:30.504 --> 01:10:32.471
An Oggly helps
whenever he can.

01:10:32.506 --> 01:10:35.474
And by the looks of you,
you're practically family.

01:10:35.509 --> 01:10:36.838
Huh? My looks?

01:10:39.248 --> 01:10:41.347
What are you all staring at?

01:10:44.814 --> 01:10:46.814
She doesn't know.

01:10:46.849 --> 01:10:48.948
What don't I know?

01:10:48.983 --> 01:10:49.948
That.

01:10:52.018 --> 01:10:54.557
Sloppy slime balls!

01:10:54.592 --> 01:10:57.494
Your drops, essence
of Lady Mayoress!

01:10:57.529 --> 01:10:59.760
You must take this at once!

01:11:08.902 --> 01:11:09.736
Hmm.

01:11:12.609 --> 01:11:13.772
Huh, it works!

01:11:16.007 --> 01:11:17.578
Mom!

01:11:20.979 --> 01:11:24.013
Hey, you're
getting me all dirty!

01:11:24.048 --> 01:11:25.948
You're back to
your old self again!

01:11:25.983 --> 01:11:27.785
Oh!

01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:30.260
Professor, how did you get
the essence of my mother?

01:11:30.295 --> 01:11:33.791
The essence of a
lady is in her handbag!

01:11:35.828 --> 01:11:38.267
I'm afraid there's nothing left.

01:11:38.302 --> 01:11:42.370
Don't worry about it, Professor,
it was too full anyway.

01:11:46.739 --> 01:11:49.278
Max, are you okay?

01:11:49.313 --> 01:11:50.674
Yup.

01:11:51.809 --> 01:11:54.007
And you woke me up for this?

01:11:54.042 --> 01:11:58.011
Now, where's that Mr. Hammer
Lotta was talking about?

01:11:58.046 --> 01:11:59.914
I'll be right back.

01:11:59.949 --> 01:12:04.291
All right, Hammer, you
malodorous millipede!

01:12:04.326 --> 01:12:05.358
Huh?

01:12:06.493 --> 01:12:08.625
Where is that louse?

01:12:10.695 --> 01:12:13.794
Hm, he can't have gotten far.

01:12:13.829 --> 01:12:14.993
Lotta, call my mobile!

01:12:15.028 --> 01:12:16.060
Huh?

01:12:16.095 --> 01:12:17.369
But you're standing right here.

01:12:17.404 --> 01:12:18.766
Just do it!

01:12:18.801 --> 01:12:20.405
Okay, okay.

01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:22.000
Everyone be quiet!

01:12:26.071 --> 01:12:27.774
Firebottom, fetch!

01:12:36.455 --> 01:12:38.047
Huh?

01:12:38.082 --> 01:12:38.916
Hello?

01:12:39.886 --> 01:12:40.720
Gotcha!

01:12:40.755 --> 01:12:42.084
Huh?

01:12:45.364 --> 01:12:47.023
Oh, good little dragon.

01:12:49.763 --> 01:12:50.696
Help, help, let go of me!

01:12:50.731 --> 01:12:51.961
Hey!

01:12:51.996 --> 01:12:55.338
Do you know how
much this suit cost?

01:12:55.373 --> 01:12:56.031
Put me down!

01:12:58.409 --> 01:13:00.607
That man stole my phone!

01:13:00.642 --> 01:13:01.542
Lies!

01:13:07.142 --> 01:13:09.384
Who do you think you are?

01:13:09.419 --> 01:13:11.012
Hey, I knew it.

01:13:11.047 --> 01:13:14.487
And why exactly do you
have my son's mobile phone?

01:13:14.522 --> 01:13:16.082
I, uh.

01:13:16.117 --> 01:13:18.018
I, uh, think that you and I

01:13:18.053 --> 01:13:20.394
need to have a little chat
down at the station, eh.

01:13:24.433 --> 01:13:26.795
What about my mobiles?

01:13:29.129 --> 01:13:30.370
What mobiles?

01:13:41.745 --> 01:13:42.579
Oh.

01:13:46.981 --> 01:13:49.454
Come on, children, it's time.

01:13:49.489 --> 01:13:50.080
Yeah.

01:13:50.115 --> 01:13:51.422
We have to go.

01:13:51.457 --> 01:13:52.687
Yeah, I guess he is right.

01:13:52.722 --> 01:13:54.117
But why?

01:13:54.152 --> 01:13:56.152
Mr. Hammer's gone.

01:13:56.187 --> 01:13:58.891
All the same, I
think it's obvious

01:13:58.926 --> 01:14:01.465
that these people
don't want us here.

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:04.665
Moldering moth
farts, don't be sad.

01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:07.833
There are other rubbish
dumps in other towns.

01:14:07.868 --> 01:14:09.769
But we like this one!

01:14:09.804 --> 01:14:11.540
With Max and Lotta!

01:14:16.007 --> 01:14:20.680
It certainly was the best
home we've ever found but still.

01:14:22.783 --> 01:14:24.519
Hmm, come on, kids.

01:14:29.756 --> 01:14:32.592
I wish there was
something I could do.

01:14:32.627 --> 01:14:33.857
We know that.

01:14:36.224 --> 01:14:39.191
It's not
your fault, Max.

01:14:39.226 --> 01:14:40.401
Bye bye Max.

01:14:41.470 --> 01:14:42.733
Bye bye, Lotta.

01:14:46.134 --> 01:14:49.640
Bye, Max. Bye, Lotta.

01:14:49.675 --> 01:14:51.543
Bye.

01:14:55.516 --> 01:14:56.042
Wait!

01:14:56.077 --> 01:14:56.878
Huh?

01:14:56.913 --> 01:14:58.176
Please, stay.

01:14:59.179 --> 01:15:00.453
But you said-

01:15:00.488 --> 01:15:02.751
- I know what I said.

01:15:02.786 --> 01:15:03.620
But,

01:15:05.250 --> 01:15:08.790
then I saw the world
through Oggly eyes.

01:15:12.532 --> 01:15:13.465
Sorry.

01:15:13.499 --> 01:15:14.597
It's all right.

01:15:14.632 --> 01:15:17.028
And I'm sorry about how we,

01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:19.998
how I've treated you.

01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:26.234
Max, you were right.

01:15:26.269 --> 01:15:28.478
The Ogglies need a home.

01:15:28.513 --> 01:15:31.976
If we don't give them
a chance, who will?

01:15:33.584 --> 01:15:37.519
By my stinky socks, I'll
get used to you!

01:15:37.554 --> 01:15:39.554
We can stay!

01:15:40.282 --> 01:15:41.490
It's wonderful.

01:15:42.724 --> 01:15:44.559
Yes!

01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:47.056
So, the wellness temple

01:15:47.091 --> 01:15:48.893
won't be built on
the rubbish dump?

01:15:48.928 --> 01:15:50.091
Yes, it will.

01:15:50.126 --> 01:15:50.993
Huh?

01:15:51.028 --> 01:15:52.225
What?

01:15:59.267 --> 01:16:01.541
But we will use your plan.

01:16:02.709 --> 01:16:04.478
Oh, thank you, Mom!

01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:07.943
Maybe the Ogglies
will help you.

01:16:07.978 --> 01:16:11.518
Dehydrated dung
balls, of course, we'll help!

01:16:12.752 --> 01:16:13.651
- Children, let's see.
- Yay!

01:16:13.686 --> 01:16:14.718
We finally found a home!

01:16:14.753 --> 01:16:16.115
We can stay for good!

01:16:23.157 --> 01:16:24.959
An
Oggly invasion!

01:16:24.994 --> 01:16:26.828
I spend three days
relaxing and.

01:16:26.863 --> 01:16:29.127
She's one of
them. This is a conspiracy.

01:16:29.162 --> 01:16:31.162
What on earth
happened to you two?

01:16:31.197 --> 01:16:32.834
Hello, Edward.

01:16:32.869 --> 01:16:33.932
You look great.

01:16:38.005 --> 01:16:40.203
Darling,
is that a new hairdo?

01:16:42.207 --> 01:16:43.976
No.

01:16:44.011 --> 01:16:46.275
Look, Edward, there's
something I have to tell you.

01:16:46.310 --> 01:16:47.243
Explain.

01:16:47.278 --> 01:16:49.618
I mean, well, both.

01:16:49.653 --> 01:16:51.752
You see, after you left.

01:16:54.691 --> 01:16:57.054
A few months ago,
Smelliville's smelly problem

01:16:57.089 --> 01:16:58.924
nearly ruined the town.

01:16:58.959 --> 01:17:00.959
But just look at it now.

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:10.231
Come with me as we uncover
what happened to Smelliville?

01:17:12.642 --> 01:17:14.674
Ma, the Ogglies happened.

01:17:17.008 --> 01:17:18.678
Of course, I never doubted

01:17:18.713 --> 01:17:21.307
they should be allowed
to stay myself.

01:17:21.342 --> 01:17:24.112
Recycling is all the
rage now, you know?

01:17:24.147 --> 01:17:26.080
I've never been busier.

01:17:29.349 --> 01:17:31.184
Here you go.

01:17:31.219 --> 01:17:34.627
I think we all just started off
on the wrong foot, you know?

01:17:34.662 --> 01:17:37.354
After the first citizen's
meeting ended in chaos,

01:17:37.389 --> 01:17:39.290
the mayor called another one.

01:17:39.325 --> 01:17:43.294
This time, insisting that
everyone get to know each other.

01:17:47.641 --> 01:17:50.003
And then we thought maybe
we could help each other out.

01:17:50.038 --> 01:17:51.367
That's right!

01:17:53.338 --> 01:17:54.337
Ready?

01:17:54.372 --> 01:17:55.613
All right, everybody hold on!

01:18:11.795 --> 01:18:12.629
Tada!

01:18:13.697 --> 01:18:14.696
Wow!

01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:34.616
Welcome to the
Oggly Wellness Temple!

01:18:37.214 --> 01:18:41.622
Our wide range of activities
include, hit the Hammer!

01:18:47.421 --> 01:18:50.993
Ugh, I'd rather be in prison.

01:18:51.028 --> 01:18:55.129
And our specialty, yummy
slimy Oggly ice cream!

01:18:59.333 --> 01:19:04.170
The highest muddiest wild mud
ride the world has ever seen!

01:19:11.344 --> 01:19:15.279
Worry about tomorrow,
tomorrow Oggly yoga.

01:19:15.314 --> 01:19:18.150
And our specialty,
dragon flights!

01:19:25.422 --> 01:19:27.257
Hello, Max.

01:19:27.292 --> 01:19:30.733
We've heard from inside sources
that this was all your idea.

01:19:30.768 --> 01:19:32.427
Really? Who said that?

01:19:35.498 --> 01:19:36.464
We did!

01:19:36.499 --> 01:19:37.431
We did.

01:19:37.466 --> 01:19:38.432
Mom? Dad?

01:19:43.208 --> 01:19:45.109
Lady Mayoress,
aren't you worried

01:19:45.144 --> 01:19:48.277
that with everyone in
town having all this fun,

01:19:48.312 --> 01:19:50.179
nothing will get done?

01:19:54.757 --> 01:19:58.286
Ogglies worry about
tomorrow, tomorrow.

01:19:58.321 --> 01:19:59.320
Yes!

01:20:00.191 --> 01:20:01.025
Oh!

01:20:02.456 --> 01:20:05.457
Come on everyone,
everybody get in!

01:20:10.497 --> 01:20:13.739
Feels like home!

01:20:13.774 --> 01:20:14.432
It's wet.
