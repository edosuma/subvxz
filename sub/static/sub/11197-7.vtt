WEBVTT

00:11.640 --> 00:14.320
We're receiving a transmission, sir.
Audio only.

00:14.400 --> 00:16.800
Let's hear it.

00:22.200 --> 00:26.960
- I'll see if l can clean it up.
- Repeat; this is Commander Hale,

00:27.080 --> 00:30.720
chairman of the Kelownan Defence
Council, calling Stargate Command.

00:30.840 --> 00:32.800
Please respond.

00:34.920 --> 00:40.600
At approximately 0700 this morning, we
received a transmission from P2S-4C3.

00:40.680 --> 00:43.040
The man identified himself
as Commander Hale,

00:43.120 --> 00:45.200
chairman of the
Kelownan Defence Council.

00:45.280 --> 00:49.120
When l left, he was undersecretary
for military appropriations.

00:49.240 --> 00:53.840
The Kelownan government wants to
re-establish trade relations with Earth.

00:53.960 --> 00:57.200
l hope you diplomatically
told him where to shove it.

00:57.280 --> 01:01.360
- lt's not that simple, Colonel.
- They tried to frame Daniel.

01:01.440 --> 01:05.519
l don't think it's fair to judge them all
by the actions of a few scientists.

01:05.600 --> 01:08.400
The Kelownans are
technologically inferior to Earth.

01:08.520 --> 01:11.520
- They have little to offer.
- Except naquadria.

01:11.600 --> 01:13.640
Which doesn't work.

01:13.720 --> 01:16.800
The hyperspace drive
on the X-302 didn't work.

01:16.880 --> 01:20.240
That doesn't mean we should give up.
Naquadria is still our best bet

01:20.320 --> 01:24.160
for creating shields and weapons
capable of repelling the Goa'uld.

01:24.240 --> 01:26.240
We need this.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:41.800 --> 02:44.000
The Kelownan delegation will arrive soon.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.840
Yeah.

02:46.320 --> 02:49.120
Is there a problem, Jonas Quinn?

02:51.040 --> 02:54.640
I've just been so caught up
in being a member of SG-1 ,

02:54.760 --> 02:57.120
I kind of forgot how this thing started.

02:57.200 --> 02:59.520
We have taken similar paths.

02:59.640 --> 03:04.160
I too was forced to betray all of that
in which l had placed my faith.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.080
I don't know if l can do it, Teal'c.

03:08.200 --> 03:11.440
I mean, they think that I'm a... a traitor.

03:15.960 --> 03:19.520
When l returned to Chulak after
leaving the service of Apophis,

03:19.640 --> 03:24.880
I too was considered a traitor, shol'va to
my friends and family that l'd left behind.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.200
ln their eyes, l was dead.

03:27.840 --> 03:30.800
lt must have been hard for you to go back.

03:30.920 --> 03:35.760
What l did, l did for my people.
ln time they came to understand this.

03:37.200 --> 03:38.800
Well...

03:40.720 --> 03:44.800
l don't think my people are ever gonna
have a chance to know the truth.

03:44.920 --> 03:48.960
Then you must draw strength
in knowing that your cause is just

03:49.040 --> 03:54.240
and one day your people will benefit
from the sacrifices that you have made.

04:03.520 --> 04:06.400
Welcome to Earth. I'm General Hammond.

04:07.560 --> 04:11.440
I'm Commander Hale. This is
Ambassador Dreylock and Dr Kieran.

04:11.840 --> 04:16.880
This is Colonel O'Neill, Major Carter,
Teal'c, and you know Jonas Quinn.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.920
- lt's good to see you, Professor.
- General, we have a lot to discuss.

04:23.880 --> 04:25.920
Right this way.

04:34.760 --> 04:40.080
- Friend of yours?
- He was one of my teachers at university

04:40.200 --> 04:44.240
and then he recruited me
into the naquadria project.

04:44.320 --> 04:48.280
We've been working together
side by side the last six years.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.560
Please, sit down.

05:00.120 --> 05:02.720
l must admit we were surprised
to hear from you,

05:02.840 --> 05:05.720
given the circumstances
of our last encounter.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.840
I'm sure we all regret what happened.

05:07.960 --> 05:11.720
But l don't think anything was done
to damage relations irreparably.

05:11.840 --> 05:16.000
You accused a member of my team of
sabotage to cover up your incompetence.

05:16.080 --> 05:20.480
And you received stolen goods
and are harbouring a traitor.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.920
Perhaps it'd be better if we
focused on the matter at hand.

05:24.040 --> 05:25.760
Which is what, exactly?

05:25.880 --> 05:28.400
For several years
an uneasy peace has resulted

05:28.480 --> 05:31.760
from the rivalry between
the three major powers on our planet -

05:31.840 --> 05:36.240
Kelowna, Tirania,
and the Andari Federation.

05:36.360 --> 05:38.880
All of that is about to change.

05:38.960 --> 05:41.200
According to our intelligence service,

05:41.280 --> 05:45.520
the Tiranians and the Andaris
are about to sign a nonaggression pact.

05:45.600 --> 05:48.480
This would leave us
in a very vulnerable position.

05:48.560 --> 05:53.680
I'm just curious -
what made you think we would care?

05:54.320 --> 05:58.160
We still have something that
you want, Colonel. Naquadria.

05:59.560 --> 06:04.080
ln fact, thanks to recent discoveries
we have a considerable surplus.

06:04.160 --> 06:07.760
We know that you're decades
ahead of us technologically.

06:07.840 --> 06:10.080
ln the field of jet propuIsion alone,

06:10.160 --> 06:13.200
you could give us
a significant strategic advantage.

06:13.320 --> 06:15.440
You want military technology?

06:15.520 --> 06:18.400
Without it, Kelowna faces annihilation.

06:18.480 --> 06:23.320
- You are assuming they intend to attack.
- The treaty is an obvious prelude to war.

06:23.440 --> 06:27.200
lf we wait for them to make the first move,
we won't stand a chance.

06:27.320 --> 06:30.560
See, we've been down this road before.

06:30.680 --> 06:34.240
On a previous mission we encountered
a race known as the Eurondans.

06:34.360 --> 06:38.160
They were losing a war. They offered
technology in exchange for help.

06:38.280 --> 06:42.040
We then discovered that they were
guilty of attempted genocide.

06:42.160 --> 06:47.600
l hardly think this situation compares.
All we want is to protect our people.

06:50.360 --> 06:53.360
l understand, but given
our past experience

06:53.440 --> 06:57.120
we're reluctant to interfere
in the affairs of another planet.

06:57.200 --> 06:59.640
According to Mr Quinn's original report,

06:59.760 --> 07:04.400
you regularly interfere in the affairs
of a race known as the Goa'uld.

07:05.800 --> 07:08.160
Well, that's a little different.

07:08.280 --> 07:12.160
The Goa'uld enslave millions
of people across the galaxy.

07:12.280 --> 07:17.040
lf you were to provide us with the means
for a quick and decisive victory,

07:17.160 --> 07:21.040
you could potentially save
hundreds of thousands of lives.

07:21.120 --> 07:26.000
lf not, we would have no choice
but to fall back on our last resort.

07:26.920 --> 07:31.680
Dr Kieran and his team have
successfully tested a naquadria bomb.

07:31.760 --> 07:35.360
lts destructive power
was beyond all expectations.

07:35.920 --> 07:40.400
lf you do not help us, we will
have no choice but to use it.

07:49.240 --> 07:52.720
Do you believe the Kelownans
are truly facing annihilation?

07:52.840 --> 07:56.320
Just before l left, we did a projection
based on this scenario.

07:56.400 --> 07:59.840
We calculated that enemy forces
would achieve air superiority

07:59.920 --> 08:01.920
within the first five weeks of war.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.560
So if they use the bomb,
they have to do it fast.

08:04.640 --> 08:07.920
They're probably considering
a pre-emptive first strike.

08:08.040 --> 08:09.120
Really?

08:09.240 --> 08:13.120
l helped research this report. lf they
stick with conventional weapons,

08:13.240 --> 08:18.880
we are looking at a complete collapse
of their entire military within six months.

08:18.960 --> 08:22.800
Can't they negotiate? l mean,
what are they fighting for, anyway?

08:22.880 --> 08:26.320
There's a thousand grievances
that go back generations.

08:26.400 --> 08:30.000
The last major conflict was 20 years ago.
Nothing was resolved.

08:30.080 --> 08:34.640
But in the past the Tiranians and Andaris
hated each other more than Kelownans.

08:34.760 --> 08:37.919
- Apparently they got over it.
- lt's a marriage of convenience.

08:38.039 --> 08:41.520
They'll turn on each other,
but by then it'll be too late for Kelowna.

08:41.600 --> 08:47.520
Jonas, you're a member of SG-1 now.
Your priorities have changed.

08:52.960 --> 08:56.800
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- The joint chiefs are meeting in an hour.

08:56.920 --> 09:00.680
They're going to want me
to give them a recommendation.

09:02.240 --> 09:03.920
We can't do it, sir.

09:04.040 --> 09:06.520
We shouldn't help them
defend themselves?

09:06.640 --> 09:09.840
l have nothing against them
defending themselves, but...

09:09.920 --> 09:12.520
how do we know they'll stop there?

09:12.640 --> 09:16.240
- You sound like Dr Jackson.
- We spent some time together.

09:16.360 --> 09:20.480
l wonder if this doesn't have more to do
with your distaste for the Kelownans.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.200
- Possibly, sir.

09:22.320 --> 09:25.840
Unscheduled offworld activation.

09:30.560 --> 09:32.720
- Sergeant?
- We're receiving a signal.

09:32.840 --> 09:35.120
- lt's the Kelownans.
- Open the iris.

09:50.280 --> 09:51.480
Dr Kieran.

09:51.600 --> 09:54.520
l apologise for Ambassador
Dreylock and Commander Hale.

09:54.640 --> 09:57.480
They were called
to an emergency cabinet meeting.

09:57.560 --> 09:59.920
The nonaggression pact
was signed an hour ago.

10:00.040 --> 10:03.040
My superiors will meet soon
to discuss your situation.

10:03.160 --> 10:06.800
ln the meantime, l'd like
to speak to Jonas Quinn.

10:19.960 --> 10:21.520
Jonas.

10:22.360 --> 10:26.040
Professor. l didn't know
that you were back.

10:27.120 --> 10:29.480
So this is where you're working now.

10:29.560 --> 10:32.160
Yeah, when...

10:32.280 --> 10:35.360
when I'm not offworld. Please.

10:35.480 --> 10:38.960
Offworld. You must have
seen some incredible things.

10:40.400 --> 10:44.560
- You have no idea.
- Well, you were always a dreamer, Jonas.

10:45.240 --> 10:48.720
But, of course, some of us
had to stay behind to deal with reality.

10:48.800 --> 10:51.760
l had to leave. These people
have a much better chance

10:51.840 --> 10:55.080
of doing something useful with
the naquadria than we ever had.

10:55.200 --> 10:58.000
What good is that to Kelowna?

11:00.880 --> 11:04.480
lf they can master shield technology,
they'll share that with us.

11:04.560 --> 11:07.920
They won't even share
their most basic military hardware.

11:08.000 --> 11:12.080
That's because you come to them
as a representative of only one nation.

11:12.160 --> 11:17.360
What the people on our planet need to do
is to get over their differences and unite.

11:22.720 --> 11:25.520
Do you really believe that?

11:26.800 --> 11:28.400
Of course.

11:28.520 --> 11:31.280
Then come with me now,
and we could make it happen.

11:31.360 --> 11:34.160
What are you talking about?

11:34.240 --> 11:39.080
l couldn't say anything before because
the other two are not in the organisation.

11:39.200 --> 11:43.600
The Resistance. I'm a member
of an underground network, Jonas.

11:43.680 --> 11:47.760
We've infiltrated every level
of government - even the military.

11:47.880 --> 11:51.280
We intend to stop our leaders
before they take us to destruction.

11:51.360 --> 11:53.360
You're talking about a coup.

11:53.440 --> 11:57.920
When the time is right.
But we need your help.

12:00.640 --> 12:04.880
This is insane. You're telling me that
you're part of a secret organisation

12:05.000 --> 12:08.760
that is going to seize power
from the government.

12:08.880 --> 12:11.280
- Right.
- You're gonna get yourself killed.

12:11.400 --> 12:14.400
On the contrary. This is
our best chance for survival.

12:14.480 --> 12:18.720
There's widespread discontent with
the government's hardline war policy.

12:18.840 --> 12:22.240
That's true in Tirania and with
the Andari Federation as well.

12:22.360 --> 12:26.560
The people of all three countries
are sick of this never-ending conflict,

12:26.680 --> 12:30.000
but their leaders have
stopped listening to them.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.880
Do you really think you can succeed?

12:33.760 --> 12:38.560
l was at the first test
of the naquadria bomb.

12:38.640 --> 12:43.360
l saw the destruction. I've been having
nightmares about it ever since.

12:45.720 --> 12:48.320
We have to succeed.

12:50.080 --> 12:52.320
When will they move
against the government?

12:52.440 --> 12:55.520
l don't know, but to prevent war
they have to do something fast.

12:55.640 --> 12:58.240
That will not prevent
their enemies from attacking.

12:58.360 --> 13:02.960
According to Dr Kieran, there is support
for a settlement in all three countries.

13:03.080 --> 13:05.640
They believe if the Resistance
seizes Kelowna

13:05.720 --> 13:09.680
it will compel the other governments to
come back to the table or risk uprisings.

13:09.800 --> 13:13.920
At the least, they'll be too busy dealing
with internal discontent to attack.

13:14.040 --> 13:17.120
lf they pull it off, we might have
a more viable trading partner.

13:17.240 --> 13:20.240
We'd need a lot more intel
before we proceed with anything.

13:20.320 --> 13:23.040
The Pentagon has authorised
SG-1 to return to the planet

13:23.160 --> 13:28.240
and offer Kelowna non-military
technology in exchange for naquadria.

13:28.600 --> 13:32.200
- They'll never go for it.
- Maybe not, but we have to try.

13:32.320 --> 13:34.760
ln the meantime, contact the Resistance

13:34.880 --> 13:39.680
and determine their strength, their
numbers, and their chance for success.

13:49.520 --> 13:53.280
- Are you ready to go home?
- I'm not expecting a parade.

13:53.400 --> 13:56.320
Not everyone in Kelowna
thinks you're a traitor.

13:56.440 --> 13:59.040
After you left,
all of us on the naquadria project

13:59.160 --> 14:02.760
began to question what we were doing.
You opened our eyes.

14:02.880 --> 14:04.960
Anyway, it's just temporary.

14:05.040 --> 14:09.600
lf l stay a minute after the negotiations
are finished l'll be arrested for treason.

14:09.680 --> 14:13.360
That will all change after
the Resistance takes power.

14:14.440 --> 14:17.440
All right, let's move out.

14:33.280 --> 14:38.080
Hello again. I apologise for the
delay, but these are difficult times for us.

14:38.200 --> 14:40.480
May l present First Minister Valis?

14:40.600 --> 14:43.600
Colonel O'Neill, Teal'c, Major Carter...

14:43.720 --> 14:46.480
And Jonas Quinn.

14:49.960 --> 14:52.720
lt's good to see you again, Jonas.

14:52.840 --> 14:55.440
Thank you, sir.

14:56.560 --> 14:58.640
Shall we?

15:04.520 --> 15:09.120
- Have you spoken to your superiors?
- Why, yes, we have.

15:10.640 --> 15:13.200
They send their best.

15:17.120 --> 15:20.400
We've been authorised
to continue the trade negotiations.

15:20.480 --> 15:22.480
Excellent.

15:22.600 --> 15:27.120
Before we continue, there's
something l'd like to clarify.

15:27.200 --> 15:30.080
Ambassador Dreylock
referred to recent discoveries

15:30.160 --> 15:32.440
leading to a surplus of naquadria.

15:32.560 --> 15:38.000
Yes. Our archaeologists have discovered
mine shafts beneath the original site.

15:38.080 --> 15:42.160
We've managed to extract and
process a considerable amount.

15:42.720 --> 15:44.800
How much?

15:44.880 --> 15:49.360
l thought you'd be interested in the figure,
so we converted it to your weight system.

15:49.440 --> 15:53.120
l believe it's something
in the area of 300 pounds.

15:56.680 --> 15:59.280
That's an awful lot of dangerous material.

16:00.800 --> 16:04.800
l could look at your storage facilities.
l might be able to offer advice.

16:04.920 --> 16:07.920
That won't be necessary.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
lt's purely a matter of safety.

16:10.120 --> 16:13.720
As Major Carter said, the naquadria
is extremely dangerous

16:13.840 --> 16:17.120
and we'd hate for some sort
of accident to happen.

16:18.600 --> 16:19.840
Mm.

16:19.960 --> 16:22.720
Clearly, you have more
naquadria than you require.

16:22.840 --> 16:26.080
What precisely are you
asking for in return?

16:28.000 --> 16:32.160
We need to start by addressing
a serious imbalance in air power.

16:32.240 --> 16:34.240
Our enemies have superior numbers

16:34.320 --> 16:37.760
in both strategic bombers
and long-range fighter escorts.

16:37.840 --> 16:42.760
Our only hope is to get our jet-interceptor
programme off the ground.

16:42.880 --> 16:45.920
We've had technical difficulties
with the programme,

16:46.000 --> 16:50.560
but we have managed
to successfully test a few designs.

16:50.680 --> 16:54.440
We believe that with the help of Major
Carter and a team of your engineers,

16:54.560 --> 16:58.640
we can have a combat-ready
squadron in less than a month.

16:59.720 --> 17:03.440
Well, that's not exactly
what we had in mind.

17:04.720 --> 17:07.680
We understand from Jonas
that Kelownan medical science

17:07.760 --> 17:11.680
currently has little or no defence
against bacterial infections.

17:11.800 --> 17:15.119
We're offering a series of drugs
known as antibiotics.

17:15.240 --> 17:18.480
We estimate they could save
15,000 lives in the first year alone.

17:18.599 --> 17:23.920
That's a generous offer, Major, and under
different circumstances we might accept.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.520
But at the moment
we have more pressing needs.

17:40.360 --> 17:43.200
So how are the negotiations coming?

17:43.320 --> 17:49.840
Well, after four hours, the only thing we
could agree on was to adjourn for the day.

17:49.960 --> 17:51.440
We're clear, sir. No bugs.

17:51.560 --> 17:55.080
l do not believe they will settle
for less than military technology.

17:55.160 --> 17:57.720
They know how much
you want the naquadria.

17:57.800 --> 18:00.800
They think that eventually
you'll give them what they want.

18:00.920 --> 18:04.640
ln the meantime, we need you
to take us to this... Resistance.

18:04.760 --> 18:09.280
lt's not that simple. l don't get in touch
with them, they get in touch with me.

18:09.360 --> 18:11.120
What do you do for them?

18:11.240 --> 18:15.120
l keep them apprised of all the top-level
research at the Academy of Science.

18:15.200 --> 18:17.360
Where do you meet them?

18:17.440 --> 18:22.880
They have a base in an old warehouse
by the freight yards. lt's heavily guarded.

18:22.960 --> 18:26.240
- Take us there.
- l can't.

18:26.320 --> 18:30.640
I'm not even supposed to go there myself
unless l have a scheduled drop.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.440
Professor...

18:38.840 --> 18:41.400
All right, l'll talk to them.

19:20.000 --> 19:24.080
- We weren't expecting you this evening.
- I'm sorry. l needed to talk to you.

19:24.200 --> 19:26.680
This isn't a very good time
to be taking risks.

19:26.800 --> 19:30.680
Some members of the government
are beginning to question your loyalty.

19:30.800 --> 19:34.400
- They've been watching you.
- l wasn't followed.

19:34.480 --> 19:36.960
Is this about the delegation from Earth?

19:37.080 --> 19:40.080
Yes. They want to meet with you.

19:40.160 --> 19:44.560
How do you know they won't betray us
in exchange for naquadria?

19:44.680 --> 19:47.440
l don't think they would
do something like that.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.760
You trust them?

19:49.840 --> 19:51.800
l trust Jonas.

20:02.480 --> 20:03.440
First Minister?

20:05.880 --> 20:07.840
Come in.

20:14.040 --> 20:18.640
l wanted a chance to talk to you,
Jonas, away from the negotiations.

20:19.960 --> 20:21.520
Please.

20:39.800 --> 20:46.080
lt's difficult for me, Jonas,
seeing you sitting across the table,

20:47.320 --> 20:50.440
acting as the representative
of another planet.

20:51.120 --> 20:53.920
lt's not easy for me either.

20:54.920 --> 20:58.200
But l made my choices
and I'm gonna stick by them.

20:59.280 --> 21:02.640
I'm sure you thought
you were doing the right thing.

21:02.720 --> 21:05.680
Oh, l know l did the right thing.

21:05.760 --> 21:09.920
Stargate Command
is going to use the naquadria

21:10.040 --> 21:13.200
to come up with technologies
that may one day save this world

21:13.320 --> 21:18.560
from an enemy
you can't possibly imagine.

21:19.040 --> 21:24.320
You were one of the most promising
young men any of us had ever seen.

21:26.200 --> 21:29.440
Our people had such high hopes for you.

21:29.560 --> 21:31.840
You're not the only one
who was disappointed.

21:31.960 --> 21:37.520
l know that you think this is the same
old bad blood resurfacing again,

21:37.640 --> 21:41.680
just another round of petty violence.
But it's not.

21:42.320 --> 21:44.320
This time...

21:46.760 --> 21:50.800
this time, Jonas, we face total defeat.

21:54.240 --> 21:58.480
Then get back to the negotiating table.
Give up some land. Do whatever it takes.

21:58.600 --> 22:02.280
You know how much the Tiranians
and the Andaris hate each other.

22:02.400 --> 22:05.840
Do you really think that they
overcame 200 years of prejudice

22:05.960 --> 22:08.160
just to get us to give up a little land?

22:08.280 --> 22:11.840
They mean to destroy us, Jonas.

22:11.960 --> 22:14.640
This is the first step
in a fight for world domination,

22:14.760 --> 22:19.440
and the naquadria is the only
advantage that we have.

22:22.320 --> 22:24.800
And that is where you come in, my friend.

22:26.680 --> 22:30.480
- l come in?
- You're a man of unique talents, Jonas,

22:30.920 --> 22:34.160
and, despite what you did,

22:35.000 --> 22:39.280
l know that it's not too late
for you to serve your country.

22:39.800 --> 22:41.920
I'm offering you
a second chance to do that.

22:42.040 --> 22:46.080
lf you're asking for information on Earth
technology, that's not gonna happen.

22:46.160 --> 22:48.440
- l will not betray friends.
- On the contrary.

22:48.560 --> 22:50.720
I'm asking you to help a friend.

22:58.760 --> 23:02.800
Dr Kieran hasn't been
the same since you left.

23:06.520 --> 23:12.320
Unfortunately, the strain of completing the
naquadria project has... has taken its toll.

23:13.960 --> 23:19.360
Lately, his behaviour has
become increasingly... erratic.

23:20.360 --> 23:22.560
How do you mean?

23:22.680 --> 23:27.840
We're concerned that in his current state,
he may be prone to errors of judgement.

23:27.920 --> 23:31.280
We want someone to watch over him.

23:31.360 --> 23:33.720
You mean spy on him?

23:33.840 --> 23:36.200
He trusts you, Jonas,

23:36.320 --> 23:39.120
and he's still very important to us.

23:41.680 --> 23:45.760
lf you do this, you will
be granted a full pardon.

23:46.320 --> 23:49.360
You'll be reinstated into
your position at the academy.

23:49.440 --> 23:55.680
Your life will resume as though
none of this had ever happened.

24:01.240 --> 24:04.640
lt's time, Jonas, for you to come home.

24:18.320 --> 24:20.320
Oh, I'm tired.

24:26.440 --> 24:29.200
You've been under a lot of strain.

24:32.080 --> 24:34.960
l can't concentrate any more.

24:35.080 --> 24:38.480
I've got these headaches
and my mind wanders.

24:41.600 --> 24:44.400
lt'll all be over soon.

24:48.240 --> 24:52.800
Do you think l should take Colonel O'Neill
and the others to meet the Resistance?

24:52.880 --> 24:55.440
They can help.

24:56.520 --> 25:00.280
- l don't know if l trust them.
- You trust me, don't you?

25:02.360 --> 25:04.320
Of course.

25:04.440 --> 25:07.040
Don't worry, then.

25:12.400 --> 25:14.960
Everything's gonna be fine.

25:16.920 --> 25:18.800
You have surface-to-air missiles

25:18.920 --> 25:22.880
that are capable of destroying enemy
bombers before they reach our cities.

25:23.000 --> 25:26.560
Yes, we do, but we can't give 'em to you.

25:27.240 --> 25:29.920
lt's purely a defensive technology.

25:30.000 --> 25:35.520
Yes, and then one day you take down
enemy aircraft defending their cities,

25:35.600 --> 25:38.000
and quite suddenly, yes, quite suddenly,

25:38.120 --> 25:41.640
they become not just
defensive but offensive.

25:41.760 --> 25:46.080
Any superior defensive technology can
be turned into an offensive advantage.

25:46.160 --> 25:47.840
But we are not the aggressors.

25:47.960 --> 25:50.880
You said you wanted
a quick and decisive victory.

25:50.960 --> 25:55.200
We can only assume that means
you will press any advantage we give you.

25:55.280 --> 25:58.160
Yes - as a means of saving lives.

26:01.680 --> 26:04.040
First Minister?

26:04.160 --> 26:06.720
Excuse us a moment.

26:12.000 --> 26:16.800
This is proving quite fruitless.
Have you spoken with your professor?

26:16.920 --> 26:19.520
No, l haven't seen him today.

26:21.440 --> 26:26.160
lt seems that the Tiranians are massing
their troops on our northern border.

26:27.640 --> 26:30.640
Have they broken off
diplomatic relations?

26:31.320 --> 26:35.200
- Not yet.
- Well, then there's still a chance.

26:35.920 --> 26:37.920
- Maybe we could talk to them.
- You?

26:38.040 --> 26:40.880
Stargate Command
has teams of skilled diplomats.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.760
lt might help to have
an objective third party.

26:43.840 --> 26:47.120
- No, I'm afraid that's impossible.
- Why?

26:47.200 --> 26:51.760
That would require us to reveal
the existence of the Stargate.

26:51.840 --> 26:54.640
Maybe that's not such a bad idea.

26:55.920 --> 26:59.600
Once they realise the advancements
they can acquire through negotiations

26:59.720 --> 27:01.520
they might not be so eager to attack.

27:01.640 --> 27:04.240
You are asking us to reveal
something to our enemies

27:04.320 --> 27:07.120
that we have yet to admit
to our own people.

27:07.200 --> 27:09.640
Looks like it's time you did.
Think about it.

27:09.760 --> 27:14.880
lf everybody knew that this was just one
in thousands of inhabited planets,

27:14.960 --> 27:17.920
they'd focus on similarities
instead of differences.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.480
That's a noble sentiment, Jonas.

27:20.600 --> 27:24.240
Of course, if it were that simple
I'm sure the existence of the Stargate

27:24.360 --> 27:27.520
would be public knowledge
on Earth as well.

27:32.040 --> 27:34.640
Isn't that right, Colonel?

27:38.160 --> 27:39.760
Yeah.

27:45.840 --> 27:48.640
- Who is it?
- Professor, it's me.

27:49.920 --> 27:51.280
Jonas?

27:51.360 --> 27:53.920
Yeah, Professor. Open up.

28:00.920 --> 28:06.000
- Is something wrong?
- Uh... lt's Tomis, Tomis Leed.

28:06.080 --> 28:10.160
He's another one of the scientists
on the naquadria project.

28:10.240 --> 28:12.080
What's wrong with him?

28:12.200 --> 28:15.520
He was transferred overnight.
They won't say where he went.

28:15.600 --> 28:19.200
- Was he a member of the Resistance?
- l recruited him myself.

28:19.320 --> 28:21.760
- Now l'll get arrested.
- We don't know that.

28:21.880 --> 28:24.960
This is not the first time.
A month ago, it was Dr Silas.

28:25.080 --> 28:28.680
They said he was transferred and he
hasn't been seen or heard from since.

28:28.800 --> 28:33.640
We were the three original members
of the project. Now I'm the only one left.

28:33.760 --> 28:35.520
All right. We're outta here.

28:35.640 --> 28:39.360
- You're leaving?
- The negotiations are going nowhere,

28:39.480 --> 28:43.680
you're not helping us and, quite frankly,
your organisation is about to be exposed.

28:43.800 --> 28:48.800
Wait. We're going to make our move
in two days, but we need your help.

28:50.640 --> 28:52.080
What are you proposing?

28:52.200 --> 28:56.480
We're in a position to take every major
government building except this one.

28:56.560 --> 28:59.920
- This is their most guarded facility.
- Because of the Stargate.

29:00.040 --> 29:02.480
Right. But you can come
and go as you please.

29:02.600 --> 29:05.760
You could get a hundred armed men
in here before anyone knew.

29:05.840 --> 29:08.640
You could take the building
from the inside.

29:08.720 --> 29:11.600
- Not a chance.
- Think about it.

29:11.720 --> 29:15.520
lf you want the coup to succeed, it has
to be quick and as bloodless as possible.

29:15.640 --> 29:19.200
lf we try to take the building ourselves
we'll get caught in a firefight.

29:19.320 --> 29:22.560
- lt could dissolve into a civil war.
- Not my problem.

29:22.680 --> 29:26.000
There's something eIse.
Over the past three months,

29:26.080 --> 29:31.080
I've been smuggling small amounts
of naquadria into the Resistance.

29:33.920 --> 29:36.800
We've built up a considerable stockpile.

29:39.800 --> 29:41.920
lf you help us, it's yours.

29:45.640 --> 29:48.240
At least talk to them.

29:49.640 --> 29:52.240
l'll set up a meeting.

30:05.680 --> 30:09.520
- Jonas, what are you doing here?
- You're being followed.

30:09.640 --> 30:11.600
This way.

30:18.840 --> 30:21.840
- How far to Resistance headquarters?
- Just down that way.

30:21.960 --> 30:23.040
Show me.

30:23.160 --> 30:25.760
You there Don't move

31:10.680 --> 31:13.040
- Jonas
- Professor

31:29.240 --> 31:30.880
What's his condition?

31:31.000 --> 31:33.920
Well, sir, he has a severe
fracture to his left tibia,

31:34.000 --> 31:37.200
but it's the blunt trauma
to the head that worries me.

31:37.320 --> 31:39.880
We'll keep him under observation for now.

31:39.960 --> 31:43.040
- Any idea how it happened?
- According to the Kelownans,

31:43.120 --> 31:46.480
he was found lying in a deserted street.
No one knows how he got there.

31:46.600 --> 31:50.320
Jonas convinced them he'd have
a better chance of recovery with us.

31:50.440 --> 31:53.040
- Keep me posted.
- Yes, sir.

31:55.600 --> 31:59.920
- What exactly are the Kelownans saying?
- Not much.

32:00.040 --> 32:02.800
They claim to have no knowledge
of how he was injured.

32:02.920 --> 32:05.280
He feared he was under threat
from the government.

32:05.400 --> 32:09.600
But if they suspected he was a rebel spy
they'd never have let us bring him here.

32:09.720 --> 32:13.360
His own people may have felt
he'd been compromised.

32:13.480 --> 32:17.520
The question is, what do we do now?
Do we go back to the table?

32:17.600 --> 32:19.520
- Sir...
- General...

32:21.760 --> 32:26.800
With respect, if we end negotiations now,
we'll be backing them into a corner.

32:26.920 --> 32:31.200
The way they see it, they'll have no choice
but to strike first with a naquadria bomb.

32:31.320 --> 32:35.760
Jonas, we'll have to do it sooner or later.
We can't give them what they want.

32:35.840 --> 32:38.640
What about the Resistance?
lf we help them seize power,

32:38.760 --> 32:41.680
we'll still get the naquadria,
plus we'll save lives.

32:41.760 --> 32:45.520
Even if we wanted to, realistically
there's no way we could find them.

32:45.640 --> 32:47.840
Actually, sir, that's not exactly true.

32:48.160 --> 32:49.200
Major?

32:50.200 --> 32:56.320
lf Dr Kieran really did smuggle naquadria
to Resistance headquarters, l can track it.

33:03.440 --> 33:06.240
This is where they found Dr Kieran.

33:07.480 --> 33:09.920
I'm picking something up.

33:10.040 --> 33:11.920
This way.

33:19.960 --> 33:21.680
Professor.

33:22.600 --> 33:25.280
- Jonas, where am l?
- You're safe.

33:26.960 --> 33:29.320
We need to get to the Resistance.
They need help.

33:29.440 --> 33:31.520
lt's all right, it's all right.

33:31.600 --> 33:35.360
Everything's going as planned.
We'll be making contact soon.

33:35.480 --> 33:39.360
We have to stop the first minister
from using the bomb.

33:39.440 --> 33:42.080
We will. We will.

33:42.200 --> 33:45.600
l never meant for it
to turn out this way, Jonas.

33:45.720 --> 33:50.240
We were scientists. We thought
we were pursuing knowledge.

33:50.360 --> 33:56.000
- We had no idea what we were creating.
- lt's not your fault.

33:58.640 --> 34:02.880
- You have something, Doctor?
- Yes. These are Dr Kieran's PET scans.

34:03.000 --> 34:08.000
lt shows no sign of brain damage from
the injury, but there is something eIse.

34:08.080 --> 34:11.840
The images are consistent with someone
suffering from schizophrenia.

34:11.920 --> 34:16.360
He's one of their leading scientists,
head of their most top-secret programme.

34:16.480 --> 34:18.120
l know. l can't explain it.

34:18.199 --> 34:21.360
The onset of this disease
is extremely rare over the age of 35.

34:21.440 --> 34:25.520
So he's functioned for at least 20 years
without anyone noticing his condition.

34:25.600 --> 34:29.199
- lt's almost inconceivable.
- What kind of symptoms are we talking?

34:29.320 --> 34:33.920
Paranoia, delusions, possibly
even full-blown hallucinations.

34:36.159 --> 34:40.320
I'm glad you weren't there
the day we tested the bomb, Jonas.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.639
Must've been hard for you.

34:42.719 --> 34:44.800
l'll never forget it.

34:44.880 --> 34:48.120
The ground shook. The air caught fire.

34:48.239 --> 34:50.600
The destruction was unimaginable.

34:50.719 --> 34:53.520
The Tiranian central forces
are located here.

34:53.639 --> 34:56.960
We'll move the Third Division
and the reserves to this point.

34:57.040 --> 35:01.040
- How long can we resist?
- First Minister?

35:01.120 --> 35:02.880
We need to talk.

35:07.080 --> 35:09.640
This way, sir.

35:12.760 --> 35:14.720
ln here.

35:36.120 --> 35:38.120
Carter, are you sure?

35:38.200 --> 35:40.960
Yes, sir. This is the place.

35:48.320 --> 35:50.320
Over here, sir.

35:56.800 --> 35:59.360
Naquadria. A lot of it.

36:09.480 --> 36:12.080
We must defend ourselves.

36:14.360 --> 36:16.720
You're gonna use the naquadria bomb.

36:16.800 --> 36:20.000
lf Earth will not help us,
we have no choice.

36:21.760 --> 36:24.360
l wish you could see what I've seen.

36:24.480 --> 36:27.680
l have actually been on board
a Goa'uld mothership.

36:27.800 --> 36:30.560
I've seen their destructive power.

36:31.400 --> 36:35.880
They can park in orbit and systematically
annihilate every major city

36:35.960 --> 36:40.240
on our entire planet, regardless
of who's Kelownan or Tiranian.

36:40.320 --> 36:42.800
To them, we're all just potential slaves.

36:42.920 --> 36:46.240
Jonas, the Goa'uld haven't
been here for a thousand years.

36:46.320 --> 36:48.480
What makes you think
they'd come back now?

36:48.560 --> 36:51.520
The naquadria is
a derivative of naqahdah,

36:51.640 --> 36:55.200
which is the very basis
of their technology.

36:55.320 --> 36:58.800
lt's literally in their blood.
They can smell it.

36:58.880 --> 37:04.960
lf you continue using it, l guarantee you,
eventually they will take notice.

37:05.040 --> 37:06.720
Jonas.

37:07.800 --> 37:10.240
We're leaving.

37:10.320 --> 37:12.640
Just... wait.

37:17.640 --> 37:19.640
What happened?

37:21.000 --> 37:24.680
Carter and Teal'c are
back at the SGC already.

37:24.800 --> 37:28.480
- What about the Resistance?
- There is no Resistance.

37:28.600 --> 37:31.280
lt was all in his head, a fantasy.

37:34.880 --> 37:37.040
That's impossible.

37:38.120 --> 37:40.720
This is from Fraiser.

37:42.080 --> 37:44.080
Dr Kieran is schizophrenic.

37:46.280 --> 37:49.360
lt might be a side effect of
the research they've been doing.

37:49.440 --> 37:52.000
The naquadria.

37:52.120 --> 37:54.720
lt's time to go home.

37:58.400 --> 37:59.880
Jonas.

38:00.000 --> 38:02.720
What happened to Dr Silas and Dr Leed?

38:04.240 --> 38:07.040
They weren't transferred, were they?

38:08.160 --> 38:11.040
They were taken to a government
mental facility, Jonas.

38:11.160 --> 38:15.520
- You knew.
- No. We suspected.

38:15.600 --> 38:18.960
We had thought that Dr Silas
was a unique case.

38:19.880 --> 38:25.760
But when Dr Leed began to exhibit
similar behaviour, we became concerned.

38:29.520 --> 38:32.800
- That's why you wanted me to watch him.
- We had to keep it quiet

38:32.920 --> 38:36.120
so as not to alarm the other scientists.

38:36.240 --> 38:39.040
Their research is too important.

38:50.280 --> 38:53.120
As near as l can tell,
it's a unique form of brain damage

38:53.200 --> 38:56.880
resulting from long-term exposure
to naquadria radiation.

38:57.000 --> 39:01.280
l went over the specs from the bomb
project. They never had proper shielding.

39:01.360 --> 39:04.960
- Is Jonas at risk?
- No. l already tested him. He's negative.

39:05.040 --> 39:08.080
My guess is he didn't
have enough exposure.

39:08.160 --> 39:10.520
The Pentagon is eager
to resume research

39:10.640 --> 39:13.080
on the naquadria
you found at the warehouse.

39:13.200 --> 39:15.640
lt shouldn't be a problem.
We are double-checking,

39:15.760 --> 39:19.360
but l think that our existing
safeguards are sufficient.

39:19.440 --> 39:24.240
l sent a message to the Kelownans
offering help to upgrade their facilities.

39:24.320 --> 39:26.160
l haven't gotten any response.

39:26.280 --> 39:29.880
We've heard nothing from them
since Colonel O'Neill and Jonas returned.

39:29.960 --> 39:32.800
They may well be at war by now.

39:32.920 --> 39:35.480
What about Dr Kieran?

39:35.560 --> 39:38.960
With medication we can keep
his condition from deteriorating.

39:39.080 --> 39:44.240
Unfortunately, there's no way to reverse
the damage that's already been done.

39:59.560 --> 40:02.000
- Jonas.
- Professor.

40:02.080 --> 40:04.120
l hear I'm being moved today.

40:05.240 --> 40:06.360
Yeah.

40:06.480 --> 40:11.680
We're gonna take you to a facility that's
better equipped to deal with your needs.

40:15.960 --> 40:19.280
l understand everything's
in place for the coup.

40:20.240 --> 40:21.680
Really?

40:21.800 --> 40:24.360
They're keeping me informed.

40:32.920 --> 40:36.960
After they take power, the Resistance
is going to dismantle the bomb

40:37.040 --> 40:40.640
and shut down the naquadria
project for ever.

40:42.480 --> 40:44.480
That's good, Professor.

40:45.880 --> 40:49.040
And they couldn't have
done it without you.

40:49.120 --> 40:52.480
- Do you really think so?
- l know so.

40:55.280 --> 40:57.880
You saved the world.
