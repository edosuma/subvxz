WEBVTT

00:02.043 --> 00:03.295
Previously on:

00:03.337 --> 00:05.589
Mr. Cannon sexually
harassed me.

00:05.631 --> 00:06.632
Why are you ruining my life?

00:06.674 --> 00:09.384
Nothing happened. I lied.

00:09.426 --> 00:10.970
How could you even ask if
you could go to Australia?

00:11.010 --> 00:13.806
She doesn't know
about the gambling,

00:13.848 --> 00:15.933
about the breaking into school.
Well, then maybe you
should tell me about it.

00:15.975 --> 00:16.934
SILVER:
What the hell?

00:16.976 --> 00:18.352
Is he stalking you?

00:18.393 --> 00:19.770
Maybe we could be friends.

00:19.812 --> 00:21.647
There's just too much
that's happened.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.732
I got this for Ade. I'm gonna
put it in her dressing room

00:23.774 --> 00:25.609
while she's performing
with a note on it that says,

00:25.651 --> 00:26.861
"Meet me on the roof."

00:26.902 --> 00:28.946
We're off to New York.
Come out and see us there.

00:28.988 --> 00:30.489
You know how long
he's been playing tennis?

00:30.531 --> 00:32.533
Since he was four.

00:32.573 --> 00:33.951
Do you want to be the one
that ruins that for him?

00:33.993 --> 00:35.786
Our relationship--
it's too much for me,

00:35.828 --> 00:37.371
and this isn't working.

00:37.412 --> 00:39.623
(laughs)

00:39.665 --> 00:40.624
It was a mistake.

00:40.666 --> 00:42.125
Totally idiotic.

00:42.167 --> 00:43.418
I've been thinking
about the tackle shop.

00:43.460 --> 00:44.419
Just gonna take some time.

00:44.461 --> 00:45.713
Maybe I can help
speed things up.

00:45.754 --> 00:47.882
We had to let Rosa go.
Why?

00:47.923 --> 00:50.049
She stole some coins
from Jeffrey's collection.

00:50.091 --> 00:52.636
Look, can I see you?
I really need to talk.

00:52.678 --> 00:53.888
Yeah, listen,
um, can we talk later?

00:53.929 --> 00:55.556
I'm actually in bed.
I think I have the flu.

00:55.597 --> 00:57.057
(horn honking)

00:57.098 --> 00:58.976
LIAM:
Hey.
Hey.

00:59.018 --> 01:00.728
I could really use your advice.

01:00.769 --> 01:02.103
Who's Jay Boyd then?
Why did you act like

01:02.145 --> 01:03.689
you were hiding something
when he called you on the phone?

01:03.731 --> 01:04.982
WOMAN:
Jennifer Clark?

01:05.024 --> 01:06.817
Dr. Boyd will see you now.

01:06.859 --> 01:08.819
Surprise!

01:08.861 --> 01:10.153
(Jen laughs)

01:11.906 --> 01:13.782
â™ª â™ª

01:18.662 --> 01:20.581
WOMAN:
And there's your baby, Jen.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.708
Oh, my gosh.

01:22.750 --> 01:25.502
Oh. Can you believe it?

01:25.544 --> 01:27.004
NAOMI:
Um, no.

01:27.046 --> 01:28.923
Not really.

01:28.964 --> 01:30.549
It's just Jen's hardly human.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.676
Who would have thought
she could reproduce?

01:32.718 --> 01:34.678
What's the matter, Naomi?
Are you disappointed

01:34.720 --> 01:35.679
that I'm pregnant?

01:35.721 --> 01:37.222
I bet you were hoping

01:37.264 --> 01:40.517
I was having a love affair
with a coke-addled chimpanzee.

01:40.559 --> 01:42.644
Hmm. Sorry, hon.

01:42.686 --> 01:44.521
Nothing that blackmail-worthy.

01:44.563 --> 01:45.731
I don't know. I'm not

01:45.773 --> 01:47.106
ruling out
the whole chimp thing.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.861
What do you mean
you don't validate?

01:50.903 --> 01:51.946
I don't have money for this.

01:51.987 --> 01:53.447
What am I supposed to do?

01:53.488 --> 01:54.740
Get a job.

01:56.909 --> 01:59.036
WOMAN:
At 24 weeks,

01:59.078 --> 02:01.622
you'll be feeling
some kicking.

02:01.663 --> 02:02.790
JEN:
Oh, please.

02:02.831 --> 02:04.041
(Jen laughs)

02:04.083 --> 02:05.667
She's a regular
David Beckham.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.127
WOMAN:
All right.

02:07.168 --> 02:09.588
Excellent...

02:09.630 --> 02:12.007
Okay, Jennifer,
everything is looking good.

02:12.049 --> 02:15.052
So you'll need to see Dr. Boyd
in two weeks.

02:21.100 --> 02:23.143
So, are you going
to tell your stepdad

02:23.184 --> 02:25.395
that you were the one
that took the coins?

02:27.606 --> 02:29.149
If I do, he'll
send me away.

02:29.190 --> 02:30.692
Or I-I don't know.

02:30.734 --> 02:33.403
Press criminal charges
probably. My life,

02:33.445 --> 02:36.156
school, surfing, friends--
I mean, all that would be over.

02:36.197 --> 02:37.741
I would never see you again.

02:38.784 --> 02:39.952
Or, you know,

02:39.994 --> 02:41.495
see anyone from West Bev.

02:41.536 --> 02:44.873
Well, um, you know,
Maybe you can make this right.

02:44.915 --> 02:47.751
Maybe you could earn money
and send it to your housekeeper,

02:47.793 --> 02:52.171
or you could help her
find a new job or something.

02:52.213 --> 02:54.925
Maybe. I don't know.
I just..

02:54.967 --> 02:57.011
I messed up, and I hurt someone.

02:57.052 --> 02:58.512
Yeah.

02:58.553 --> 03:00.931
Well, you're lucky.

03:00.973 --> 03:02.474
You know, you've got options.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.725
(sighs)

03:03.767 --> 03:04.518
Sometimes you mess up,

03:04.559 --> 03:06.103
and

03:06.145 --> 03:07.562
there's no way
that you could ever fix it.

03:11.900 --> 03:14.028
(singing lively rock duet)

03:14.069 --> 03:15.946
(cheering and whistling)

03:19.574 --> 03:21.535
You were amazing.

03:21.576 --> 03:22.870
You were amazing.

03:22.911 --> 03:24.538
We both were amazing.

03:27.749 --> 03:29.126
That was so amazing.

03:29.168 --> 03:30.919
(laughs)

03:30.961 --> 03:32.796
What is all
this stuff?

03:32.838 --> 03:35.883
Um, just gifts from my fans.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.801
Chocolate, stuffed animals.

03:37.843 --> 03:38.844
I don't know.
Underwear.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.554
Hmm.

03:40.595 --> 03:41.722
Uh...
Ew.

03:41.763 --> 03:42.890
(laughs)

03:42.931 --> 03:44.265
I don't know.

03:44.307 --> 03:46.727
Uh, some of this stuff
is from the L.A. show.

03:46.768 --> 03:49.813
Really?

03:49.855 --> 03:51.065
Ew.

03:51.106 --> 03:52.566
Oh.

03:52.607 --> 03:54.818
This is

03:54.860 --> 03:56.737
not exactly my style.

03:56.778 --> 03:57.779
Oh, I think it's sweet.

03:59.031 --> 04:00.574
You keep it.

04:00.615 --> 04:01.867
Really?

04:01.909 --> 04:03.785
It's my gift to you.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.412
Can you help me put it on?

04:05.453 --> 04:06.830
Yup.

04:06.872 --> 04:10.042
(cheering and screaming)

04:13.587 --> 04:15.672
Ooh.
Oh.

04:15.714 --> 04:16.964
What's up?

04:17.007 --> 04:18.800
You want to walk me to class?

04:18.841 --> 04:20.928
Sure.

04:20.969 --> 04:23.263
Want to go to this party thing?

04:23.304 --> 04:24.639
What, that thing?

04:24.681 --> 04:26.100
What is this?

04:26.141 --> 04:27.726
Well, actually,
it's like a tradition.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.062
You know, uh, it's like the
senior class passing the torch

04:30.104 --> 04:31.396
down to the junior class.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.857
The guys wear tuxes.
The junior girls wear red.

04:33.899 --> 04:35.234
Senior girls wear white.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.693
Food, dancing.
Mm-hmm.

04:36.735 --> 04:38.237
Should be fun.

04:38.278 --> 04:41.115
Right, because school-sanctioned
dancing sounds like a real hoot.

04:41.156 --> 04:42.824
Okay, you know
what? Get down.

04:42.866 --> 04:44.868
What?
Oh, you know you
have a bad attitude.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.453
(gasps)
I forgot to tell you.

04:46.494 --> 04:50.707
So the water in Australia goes
down the drain counterclockwise.

04:50.749 --> 04:52.126
(laughs)

04:52.167 --> 04:53.293
I'm sorry.
I think that's rad.

04:53.334 --> 04:55.003
What?

04:55.045 --> 04:56.630
We're going to Australia.

04:56.671 --> 04:58.006
I know. I'm so stoked.

04:58.048 --> 05:00.217
And Dixon, I got to tell you,

05:00.259 --> 05:02.719
I'm so glad we got over
that stupid fight thing.

05:02.761 --> 05:04.679
I definitely learned
my lesson,

05:04.721 --> 05:05.889
and as long

05:05.931 --> 05:07.224
as we're honest with each other,

05:07.266 --> 05:08.558
it's all good.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.602
Yeah.

05:10.644 --> 05:11.728
Totally.

05:11.770 --> 05:13.939
Come on.

05:15.274 --> 05:17.734
Mmm. Let's go.

05:17.776 --> 05:19.653
Yeah.

06:05.991 --> 06:09.368
(school bell ringing)

06:09.410 --> 06:12.956
We all know
the universe is expanding,

06:12.998 --> 06:15.083
but is it slowing down,

06:15.125 --> 06:17.961
or is it accelerating, hmm?

06:18.003 --> 06:20.130
I want you to partner up

06:20.172 --> 06:22.590
and start plotting the
supernovae redshift data.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.218
And maybe we'll figure
out what's going on

06:24.259 --> 06:26.427
with this
universe of ours.

06:26.469 --> 06:28.305
MAN:
Yo, bro, do you want
to work together?

06:28.347 --> 06:30.807
Dude, Mr. Reiss is so high.

06:30.849 --> 06:32.809
It's like his mind supernovaed

06:32.851 --> 06:34.644
from thinking
about the universe too much.

06:34.686 --> 06:36.063
(laughs)

06:36.104 --> 06:39.733
Uh, yeah.

06:39.774 --> 06:42.152
Look, I have something
I have to tell you.

06:42.194 --> 06:45.072
I mean, I-I can't not tell you.

06:45.113 --> 06:47.366
Remember that day
that we broke up

06:47.406 --> 06:49.159
at Adrianna's concert?

06:49.201 --> 06:51.661
Yeah. What,
for, like, two minutes?

06:51.703 --> 06:52.913
(laughs)

06:52.954 --> 06:54.331
Um, yeah.

06:58.043 --> 07:00.254
I ended up kissing Silver.

07:00.295 --> 07:03.173
Now, look, we were both

07:03.215 --> 07:05.175
sad and-and drunk,
and I swear,

07:05.217 --> 07:07.719
from the bottom of my heart,
it didn't mean anything.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.179
All right?

07:09.221 --> 07:11.348
I don't like her;
she doesn't like me;

07:11.390 --> 07:13.267
but I can't keep
a secret from you.

07:13.308 --> 07:14.893
I have to be honest.

07:17.145 --> 07:19.022
(laughs)

07:19.064 --> 07:20.190
Man, you know what?

07:20.232 --> 07:22.776
Dixon, you know what?

07:22.817 --> 07:24.819
Screw you.

07:24.861 --> 07:26.154
What?
I don't need

07:26.196 --> 07:27.864
to play second fiddle
to another girl anymore.

07:27.906 --> 07:29.783
I have gone on that ride,
and I'm done.

07:29.824 --> 07:30.825
You're not playing
second fiddle.

07:30.867 --> 07:32.577
Yeah. Right.

07:35.914 --> 07:38.417
HARRY:
"Known for his scathing
yet romantic depiction

07:38.458 --> 07:40.335
"of frivolous
upper-class Americans...

07:42.796 --> 07:45.215
"...F. Scott Fitzgerald
is considered unparalleled

07:45.257 --> 07:47.842
in the elegance and
grace of his fiction."

07:47.884 --> 07:50.804
You recognize that?

07:50.845 --> 07:52.347
Yeah, well,
that's from my paper.

07:52.389 --> 07:54.182
No, that is
from a paper

07:54.224 --> 07:57.227
that Ms. Genlow
pulled off a Web site called

07:57.269 --> 07:59.479
Greatpapersforcheap.com.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.106
I'm sorry. What?
You know what?

08:01.148 --> 08:02.899
I don't think you know
what's going on here.

08:02.941 --> 08:04.484
With this infraction,
you're going to get an F

08:04.525 --> 08:06.903
in English, and with
an F in English,

08:06.945 --> 08:08.655
you're not going
to graduate this year.

08:08.696 --> 08:11.908
Yeah, I just... You know,
I don't think it's gonna be

08:11.950 --> 08:13.910
that bad.

08:13.952 --> 08:17.038
I feel fairly confident
that you can talk to Ms. Genlow

08:17.080 --> 08:19.082
and convince her
to look the other way.

08:19.124 --> 08:20.417
Ah. Why would I do that?

08:20.459 --> 08:22.085
Well, because otherwise,

08:22.127 --> 08:23.586
I'll tell the superintendent

08:23.628 --> 08:25.922
how you covered up the fact
that your son

08:25.964 --> 08:28.008
broke into the school
the night of the vandalism.

08:28.049 --> 08:30.760
I'll do it, too.

08:40.270 --> 08:41.938
WOMAN:
Come on, people.
Let's hustle!

08:47.361 --> 08:49.779
(panting)

08:52.240 --> 08:54.742
Liam?

08:54.784 --> 08:56.244
Liam!

08:56.286 --> 08:58.913
Hey.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.541
Oh, my God, when is Obama
gonna outlaw gym class?

09:01.582 --> 09:03.543
I mean, GuantÃ¡namo Bay--
yeah, that's great.

09:03.584 --> 09:05.962
What about phys ed?
Seriously. Am I right?

09:06.004 --> 09:07.881
Phew!

09:09.924 --> 09:11.426
What's going on?

09:11.468 --> 09:13.094
Why haven't you
returned my calls?

09:13.136 --> 09:14.554
How are you feeling?

09:14.595 --> 09:16.014
Fine.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.516
I mean, fine.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.267
You know, considering
I was pretty sick.

09:19.309 --> 09:20.935
It wasn't the flu,

09:20.977 --> 09:23.104
actually. It was, uh...
It was food poisoning.

09:23.146 --> 09:24.481
Serves me right for eating
the cafeteria sushi.

09:24.523 --> 09:25.940
Just stop.

09:25.982 --> 09:28.527
Stop lying.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.028
I know you weren't sick.
I heard a car honking.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.238
You were driving, and
you pretended you were in bed.

09:31.279 --> 09:32.822
Or maybe the sushi thing

09:32.864 --> 09:33.990
happened afterwards, and
I wasn't exactly in bed per se.

09:34.032 --> 09:35.283
You know what?

09:35.325 --> 09:37.411
Naomi, I'm... It's over.

09:37.452 --> 09:41.081
I don't want to be
with you anymore.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.875
I mean, we never had much in
common; you're self-centered;

09:43.917 --> 09:45.544
and you lied to me
too many times.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.462
I mean, I forgave
the Cannon thing,

09:47.504 --> 09:49.464
but I just needed
to talk to you,

09:49.506 --> 09:52.300
and you pretended
you had the flu.

09:53.634 --> 09:55.595
It's just too much. I'm done.

09:55.636 --> 09:57.305
Oh, my God!

09:57.347 --> 10:00.100
Like you're so perfect.

10:00.141 --> 10:01.935
Like you always
do the right thing.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.270
No.

10:03.311 --> 10:04.354
I don't.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.024
But this-- you and me--

10:08.066 --> 10:10.193
we're done.

10:19.536 --> 10:21.371
So your singing career
has really taken off,

10:21.413 --> 10:22.663
hasn't it, Adrianna?

10:22.705 --> 10:24.916
It's been amazing.
Uh, I was recently

10:24.958 --> 10:27.127
signed by Laurel Cooper
at Witgate Records,

10:27.168 --> 10:29.254
and it's been so great.

10:29.296 --> 10:32.132
Word has it that
you just did a duet

10:32.173 --> 10:33.467
in New York with Javier.

10:33.508 --> 10:36.094
ADRIANNA:
Yes, I did.
It was crazy.

10:36.136 --> 10:39.598
(giggling):
I'm so excited.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.682
SILVER:
And I think that all of West Bev

10:41.724 --> 10:45.270
is extremely proud
of your accomplishments.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.480
So, you and Javier
are dating.

10:46.521 --> 10:47.564
Am I right?

10:47.606 --> 10:48.982
Tell us what's it like

10:49.023 --> 10:50.484
to date someone so famous
and successful.

10:50.525 --> 10:52.319
Uh, it's been good.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.736
I mean, he's a really sweet guy.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.405
We've just started
to get to know each other,

10:55.447 --> 10:56.948
but...
Okay, uh, cut.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.241
Uh, I'm sorry.

10:58.283 --> 10:59.784
We, uh...
we need to cut.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.495
Uh, this is
The Blaze: Live Edition, Navid.

11:01.536 --> 11:03.455
We can't cut.
Yeah, we can if I say we can.

11:03.497 --> 11:04.498
And the-the lighting
looks weird.

11:04.539 --> 11:06.207
And-and-and I want
to discuss wardrobe

11:06.249 --> 11:09.377
and, um... I need to talk
to Adrianna right now.

11:09.419 --> 11:10.920
No. Can you just please go?

11:10.962 --> 11:11.796
Okay.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.593
Navid, what's going on?

11:17.969 --> 11:19.012
Okay.

11:19.053 --> 11:20.763
Look, can I, uh...

11:20.805 --> 11:22.974
ask you a couple of my
own personal questions?

11:23.016 --> 11:24.309
Like, for instance, uh,

11:24.351 --> 11:26.353
I don't know--
where did you get that bracelet?

11:26.394 --> 11:28.229
It was a gift from Javier.

11:28.271 --> 11:29.439
From Javier?
Yeah.

11:29.481 --> 11:32.025
Javier gave me this bracelet.
What?

11:32.066 --> 11:34.027
Oh, oh, oh. And so Javier
happens to know

11:34.068 --> 11:35.278
that your favorite
flower is tulips.

11:35.320 --> 11:36.988
Oh, and...

11:37.030 --> 11:38.948
and Javier also knows that, uh,
you love butterflies

11:38.990 --> 11:41.660
and that your favorite food
is hamburgers, right?

11:41.700 --> 11:44.538
Oh, and there--
the 11 and the six.

11:44.579 --> 11:46.289
Javier also, uh, coincidentally
put those on there

11:46.331 --> 11:47.541
because he knows
the first time

11:47.582 --> 11:49.792
you and I kissed
was on November 6.
November 6.

11:51.670 --> 11:53.712
This is from you?

11:55.674 --> 11:57.716
NAVID: You know what I think?
So much for
The Blaze: Live Edition.

11:57.758 --> 12:00.261
You know what I think
about that?
What's going on?

12:00.303 --> 12:02.721
That's just fine with me.
Looks to me like it's
The Blaze: Live Edition.

12:02.763 --> 12:05.684
NAVID: You know what?
Uh, you-you can date Javier.

12:05.724 --> 12:08.562
Uh, you can fall
deeply in love with him.

12:08.603 --> 12:10.230
No, you-you can marry him
and have a...

12:10.271 --> 12:11.730
a whole brood
of-of-of Javier Juniors

12:11.772 --> 12:13.066
with amazing abs.

12:13.107 --> 12:15.527
Uh, you can do that for the rest

12:15.569 --> 12:16.735
of your-your-your
entire life.

12:16.777 --> 12:18.363
You can do all that.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.365
But you can't do it
wearing my bracelet.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.575
Who didn't turn off
their camera?

12:21.616 --> 12:23.577
Not I.
My bad.

12:23.618 --> 12:25.537
Navid yells, I... I panic.

12:25.579 --> 12:28.415
NAVID:
Give it back, Ade.
Can you give it back?

12:28.456 --> 12:31.084
Give me back my bracelet.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.502
I don't want
to give it back, Navid.

12:32.544 --> 12:34.588
(knocks)

12:34.629 --> 12:36.214
Navid!
Leave us alone, Silver.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.549
NAVID:
What do you mean you don't
want to give it back?

12:37.591 --> 12:38.717
SILVER
I don't want to give it back.

12:38.757 --> 12:41.636
I didn't think
you liked me, all right?

12:41.678 --> 12:43.471
Okay, I know
I am a lot of drama,

12:43.513 --> 12:44.431
and I-I just didn't think

12:44.472 --> 12:46.600
that you liked me.

12:46.641 --> 12:49.185
NAVID:
Well, I do.
Yeah?

12:49.227 --> 12:51.187
I like you.

12:51.229 --> 12:53.481
But I know
you're dating Javier,

12:53.523 --> 12:55.275
and he's famous and sexy

12:55.316 --> 12:57.235
and famous and...

12:57.277 --> 12:59.112
I'm just Navid.

13:00.655 --> 13:03.032
I can't begin to
compete with that.

13:03.074 --> 13:04.783
No.

13:04.825 --> 13:09.122
That's where you're wrong,
Navid, okay?

13:09.163 --> 13:13.167
No one can compete with you.

13:13.209 --> 13:15.295
ALL:
Ah.

13:21.426 --> 13:25.221
(cheering)

13:25.263 --> 13:27.140
SILVER:
I'm so happy for them.

13:27.181 --> 13:28.891
You okay?

13:30.059 --> 13:32.228
No.

13:32.270 --> 13:34.522
No, not at all.

13:34.564 --> 13:37.442
Liam just broke up with me.

13:37.484 --> 13:41.195
Oh, sweetie, come here.

13:41.237 --> 13:43.030
I'm sorry.

13:56.377 --> 13:58.546
The surface of
this crÃ¨me brulÃ©e,

13:58.588 --> 13:59.547
it isn't hard enough, okay?

13:59.589 --> 14:01.299
CrÃ¨me brulÃ©e --

14:01.341 --> 14:03.510
well, it's like a woman.

14:03.551 --> 14:04.719
It should seem impenetrable,

14:04.761 --> 14:08.264
and then tap, tap...

14:08.306 --> 14:10.684
ah, mm, and you're in.

14:10.725 --> 14:13.060
Â¿Comprende?

14:13.102 --> 14:14.354
Hmm.

14:14.395 --> 14:17.273
Can I talk to you?

14:18.650 --> 14:20.151
Yeah, uh, okay.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.277
Tio, thank you.

14:23.237 --> 14:24.280
Is it true?

14:25.615 --> 14:27.116
Are you pregnant with my kid?

14:27.158 --> 14:28.034
(scoffs)

14:29.369 --> 14:30.870
Who... told you that?

14:30.911 --> 14:33.707
I saw a paternity test.

14:33.748 --> 14:35.166
How did you even...?

14:35.208 --> 14:38.085
How did you get my DNA?

14:38.127 --> 14:39.962
Oh.

14:40.004 --> 14:42.256
You left your gnarly
hairbrush at my house.

14:42.298 --> 14:46.177
Oh, my God.

14:46.219 --> 14:47.887
So it's true.

14:50.348 --> 14:52.433
I'm gonna be a father.

14:52.475 --> 14:54.101
Whoa.

15:01.942 --> 15:04.738
You know what? I'm not
going to mess this up.

15:04.779 --> 15:08.449
I'm going to get
my life back on track.

15:08.491 --> 15:11.828
I want to be there
for my kid. I do.

15:11.870 --> 15:13.621
I don't make a lot of money,

15:13.663 --> 15:15.998
but I have
some savings,

15:16.040 --> 15:19.753
and the good thing about my job
is I get summers off, and...

15:19.794 --> 15:22.505
look, basically,
Jen, I want to do

15:22.547 --> 15:26.634
whatever I can to help
raise this baby.

15:28.803 --> 15:30.346
Our baby.

15:30.388 --> 15:33.767
I don't need your help.

15:33.808 --> 15:36.352
Thank you
very much, Ryan.

15:36.394 --> 15:37.896
I'll have nannies and baby
nurses for that kind of thing.

15:37.937 --> 15:41.482
Wait, no, but this is
my baby too, Jen.

15:41.524 --> 15:42.901
I have rights.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.736
Which I will fight
you for in court.

15:44.778 --> 15:48.907
Look, just give up,
Ryan, okay?

15:48.948 --> 15:52.034
My baby doesn't need a public
schoolteacher as a father.

15:52.911 --> 15:54.621
Wait.

15:57.498 --> 15:58.625
If you will
excuse me,

15:58.666 --> 16:00.752
I have a prenatal yoga class.

16:03.797 --> 16:07.550
TEDDY:
What's going on?
You owe me an explanation.

16:07.592 --> 16:11.721
He came over-- your dad.

16:11.763 --> 16:14.265
He, uh,

16:14.307 --> 16:17.435
he offered me money
to break up with you.

16:18.561 --> 16:20.396
$150,000.

16:20.438 --> 16:21.689
(sighs)

16:23.357 --> 16:25.276
(yelling):
I hate him!

16:25.318 --> 16:26.820
I mean, he thinks

16:26.861 --> 16:28.028
just 'cause he has money,

16:28.070 --> 16:29.489
and he's
Spence friggin' Montgomery,

16:29.530 --> 16:30.740
that he can do
whatever he wants.

16:30.782 --> 16:33.284
God, he's a jerk!

16:33.326 --> 16:34.577
Yes, yes.

16:34.619 --> 16:35.870
Okay, he's a jerk.

16:35.912 --> 16:36.996
Yes. I'm sorry.

16:44.044 --> 16:46.005
If you... if you didn't
take the money,

16:46.046 --> 16:48.466
then why did you break up
with me?

16:48.508 --> 16:53.304
'Cause your dad's a jerk,
but he's also right.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.974
I was getting in the way
of your tennis career.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.725
I care about you
too much to be the one

16:57.767 --> 16:59.686
to stand in the way of that.
I'm not going to.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.729
If you care about me so much,

17:01.771 --> 17:03.356
then why won't
you listen to me?

17:03.397 --> 17:04.941
I want you in my life.

17:04.983 --> 17:08.903
I need you in my life.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.488
And-and I can do both.

17:10.530 --> 17:13.324
I can have tennis and
a relationship with you.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.711
I'm sorry.

17:24.752 --> 17:26.045
It's over.

17:46.357 --> 17:49.068
â™ª â™ª

18:12.466 --> 18:14.510
Okay, I'm ready to leave.

18:14.552 --> 18:15.887
Oh, no. Shut up.

18:15.929 --> 18:17.680
Just because we are single

18:17.722 --> 18:21.059
does not mean we can't
have a fabulous time.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.227
â™ª All the single ladies,
all the single ladies â™ª

18:23.269 --> 18:25.563
â™ª All the single ladies,
all the single ladies â™ª

18:25.605 --> 18:27.774
â™ª Put your hands up,
up in the air... â™ª

18:27.815 --> 18:29.692
Yeah, I don't think being single
is what's holding me back.

18:29.734 --> 18:31.318
Oh, yeah? Well, what is?

18:31.360 --> 18:33.571
I don't know-- being in
a horrifically crappy mood.

18:33.613 --> 18:36.616
I don't get it. How come
you're not in a crappy mood?

18:36.657 --> 18:38.534
Because Liam
is a loser.

18:38.576 --> 18:40.078
And I'm fantastic.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.663
And I'm going to meet someone
like a thousand times better.

18:42.705 --> 18:44.540
And we just have
to keep our chins up

18:44.582 --> 18:46.584
so people don't pity us,
and as a bonus,

18:46.626 --> 18:48.836
we won't get that whole pelican
neck thing in our photos.

18:48.878 --> 18:51.589
Come on.
â™ª All the single ladies,
all the single ladies... â™ª

18:51.631 --> 18:53.466
Come on, sing with me, Silver.

18:53.507 --> 18:54.717
What?

18:54.759 --> 18:56.135
What are you staring at?

18:56.176 --> 18:58.846
Ah, Teddy.

18:58.888 --> 19:00.974
Can I ask you a question?

19:01.015 --> 19:03.726
Why did you
break up with him?

19:03.768 --> 19:05.061
You know why.

19:05.103 --> 19:06.896
I just want what's
best for him.

19:06.938 --> 19:09.023
Uh-huh. And how do you know
what's best for Teddy?

19:09.065 --> 19:12.485
Isn't that the same patronizing
attitude his father has?

19:12.526 --> 19:13.903
Shouldn't Teddy get a chance

19:13.945 --> 19:15.071
to make decisions for himself?

19:22.912 --> 19:26.124
Adrianna. There you are.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.501
Hey.

19:28.542 --> 19:31.712
Um, I have something
to tell you.

19:31.754 --> 19:34.674
No, wait. Me first.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.425
I want you to open
for me on tour.

19:36.467 --> 19:38.928
What?

19:38.970 --> 19:40.471
It'll be a huge
opportunity for you.

19:40.513 --> 19:41.931
And we'll get to travel
together, and...

19:41.973 --> 19:43.099
Stop.

19:44.684 --> 19:47.269
I got back together with Navid.

19:48.437 --> 19:50.606
Why?

19:50.648 --> 19:51.691
I love him.

19:51.732 --> 19:53.693
I'm so sorry, Javier.

20:04.453 --> 20:06.080
Hey, getting ready to sing
for these lucky kids?

20:06.122 --> 20:07.540
Yeah.

20:07.581 --> 20:10.001
What's wrong?

20:10.043 --> 20:13.212
Adrianna just
broke up with me.

20:13.253 --> 20:15.506
But it's not over
till it's over.

20:24.682 --> 20:25.975
Hey.
Hey. There you are.

20:26.017 --> 20:27.309
Wow, you're dressed up.

20:27.351 --> 20:29.520
Yeah, well, I was getting
ready for the party

20:29.562 --> 20:30.688
when I got your text.

20:30.730 --> 20:31.939
But it's cool.
I got time.

20:31.981 --> 20:33.107
What's up?

20:33.149 --> 20:34.650
Um, well, I came clean.

20:34.692 --> 20:36.485
I told my mom that
I stole the coins.

20:36.527 --> 20:37.945
You did?

20:37.987 --> 20:39.989
Yeah, and when my stepdad
gets back from Miami,

20:40.031 --> 20:41.365
I'm going to
tell him, too.

20:41.407 --> 20:43.951
At which point, my life will
essentially be over, but...

20:43.993 --> 20:45.119
Liam...

20:45.161 --> 20:47.538
No, which brings
me to my point...

20:47.580 --> 20:49.874
and my text.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.126
I'm so glad you made it
because I really wanted you...

20:52.168 --> 20:53.627
I wanted you here for this.

20:53.669 --> 20:54.879
For-for what?

20:54.921 --> 20:56.672
What-what's going on?

20:56.714 --> 20:58.049
Take a look.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.095
Oh, my gosh.

21:02.136 --> 21:03.721
Liam, it's your boat!

21:03.763 --> 21:05.806
It's on the water!
I mean...

21:05.848 --> 21:06.933
It floats.

21:06.974 --> 21:08.893
Yeah!
Yeah, I know.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.228
Oh, it's amazing, Liam.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.146
So does it work?

21:12.188 --> 21:14.023
I mean, does it sail?

21:14.065 --> 21:15.482
Let's find out.

21:15.524 --> 21:17.443
Okay.

21:21.781 --> 21:24.200
Ah.

21:24.242 --> 21:27.286
I can't believe
you did this.
(chuckles)

21:27.327 --> 21:29.830
â™ª â™ª

22:08.786 --> 22:10.955
Man, I'm gonna
get out of here.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.581
MAN (over P.A.):
Sorry for the interruption.

22:12.623 --> 22:14.667
Would Ivy Sullivan please report
to the planetarium?

22:14.708 --> 22:15.793
Ivy Sullivan
to the planetarium, please.

22:15.835 --> 22:16.710
BOYS:
Ooh...

22:16.752 --> 22:17.670
Oh, shut up.

22:17.711 --> 22:19.964
(laughter)

22:24.802 --> 22:26.179
Hello?

22:33.311 --> 22:34.687
Hello?

22:36.897 --> 22:40.026
DIXON:
Early astronomers believed
in the geocentric theory--

22:40.067 --> 22:42.945
that the earth was
the center of the universe--

22:42.987 --> 22:46.199
but in the 16th century,

22:46.240 --> 22:50.744
Copernicus presented evidence
for the heliocentric theory--

22:50.786 --> 22:54.123
that the sun was
the center of the universe--

22:54.165 --> 22:58.294
but recently, Dixon Wilson has
come up with a new understanding

22:58.336 --> 23:01.672
of our universe, he calls...

23:01.714 --> 23:04.008
Ivy-centric.

23:06.135 --> 23:08.470
(laughs)

23:10.890 --> 23:12.599
You're it, Ivy.

23:14.352 --> 23:18.480
You're the only girl
in this world for me.

23:18.522 --> 23:22.860
I mean, (chuckles)
you're the center
of my universe.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.653
Please forgive me.

23:24.695 --> 23:26.197
(laughs)

23:26.239 --> 23:28.282
God, you're crazy, Dixon.

23:28.324 --> 23:29.867
Crazy about you.

23:31.244 --> 23:33.371
And also a little
crazy, you know.

23:33.411 --> 23:35.915
Man, I've been working
on this nonstop

23:35.956 --> 23:36.957
ever since we fought.

23:36.999 --> 23:38.416
Turns out

23:38.458 --> 23:40.711
Mr. Reiss has some
connections here, so, uh...

23:40.753 --> 23:43.547
if you don't take me back,

23:43.589 --> 23:45.299
hopefully I'll at least get
a little extra credit.

23:47.968 --> 23:50.179
So what do you say?

23:55.351 --> 23:58.187
Okay.

23:58.229 --> 23:59.897
Okay, what?

23:59.939 --> 24:04.318
Okay... I would really like
to be back with you.

24:05.986 --> 24:07.780
And it'd be nice

24:07.821 --> 24:10.241
if you'd still come
to Australia

24:10.283 --> 24:11.992
'cause I'd really like you to.

24:12.034 --> 24:13.035
For real?

24:13.077 --> 24:14.995
Yes, for real.

24:15.037 --> 24:16.914
Better get home
and get your bags packed.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.498
We leave tonight.

24:23.045 --> 24:25.214
â™ª Nothing can compare
to the way you make me feel â™ª

24:25.256 --> 24:27.258
â™ª Blinded by your stare â™ª

24:27.300 --> 24:32.012
â™ª Tell me this is real â™ª

24:34.140 --> 24:39.228
â™ª Oh, oh-oh â™ª

24:39.270 --> 24:41.479
â™ª Wherever you're going â™ª

24:41.521 --> 24:43.274
â™ª You know that I'll be there â™ª

24:43.316 --> 24:46.693
â™ª However you need me... â™ª

24:46.735 --> 24:48.821
Go.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.782
Go already, go.

24:51.824 --> 24:52.950
(chuckles)

24:52.992 --> 24:55.035
And have fun.

24:59.706 --> 25:01.875
Hey.

25:01.917 --> 25:02.876
I was wrong.

25:04.128 --> 25:05.463
I love you and I want

25:05.503 --> 25:07.423
to listen to
you, and...

25:07.465 --> 25:11.302
if you think that you can
play tennis and be with me,

25:11.344 --> 25:12.552
then it's your decision.

25:14.096 --> 25:15.889
(laughs)

25:17.308 --> 25:18.976
â™ª And tell me who you are... â™ª

25:19.018 --> 25:21.312
(sighing)

25:21.354 --> 25:23.521
Hey, you want
to dance with me?

25:23.563 --> 25:24.564
Sure.
All right.

25:24.606 --> 25:26.066
Yes.

25:26.108 --> 25:27.401
â™ª The rhythm of your ... â™ª

25:27.443 --> 25:29.111
(chuckles)

25:29.153 --> 25:30.654
â™ª Wherever you're going â™ª

25:30.696 --> 25:32.490
(Silver chuckles)
â™ª You know that I'll be there â™ª

25:32.530 --> 25:34.492
â™ª However you need me â™ª

25:34.532 --> 25:37.036
â™ª Just say where, oh, where â™ª

25:37.077 --> 25:39.330
â™ª Siempre tÃº â™ª

25:39.372 --> 25:41.499
â™ª When I'm dreaming â™ª

25:41.539 --> 25:44.084
â™ª Only you... â™ª

25:44.126 --> 25:45.878
Laurel.
Hey.

25:45.919 --> 25:49.340
(laughs)
Howdy, Laurel
and Hardy.

25:49.382 --> 25:50.548
How are we?

25:50.590 --> 25:53.093
Ryan, you're in a good mood.

25:53.135 --> 25:54.928
Not really. (sighs)

25:54.970 --> 25:56.430
Yeah, actually,

25:56.472 --> 25:59.599
feeling more
like a piece of trash

25:59.641 --> 26:02.895
'cause I, uh,
was excited to be a father,

26:02.936 --> 26:04.146
you know,

26:04.188 --> 26:05.105
not just a father figure

26:05.147 --> 26:07.316
but, like,

26:07.358 --> 26:09.276
a father.
You're wasted.

26:09.318 --> 26:10.944
No, what's the matter?
I mean,

26:10.986 --> 26:12.405
I thought you were down
with the fun, baby.

26:12.446 --> 26:14.407
R-Ryan, you need
to go home.

26:14.448 --> 26:15.449
You need to go home

26:15.491 --> 26:17.410
and you need to sleep this off.

26:17.451 --> 26:20.037
Go home.

26:23.123 --> 26:25.209
â™ª Siempre tÃº. â™ª

26:25.251 --> 26:26.293
(cheering and applause)

26:35.553 --> 26:38.305
The West Beverly Hills
High School

26:38.347 --> 26:41.350
class of 2010 hereby passes

26:41.392 --> 26:44.103
the torch to the class of 2011.

26:47.940 --> 26:51.485
â™ª â™ª

26:58.909 --> 27:00.994
Ah...

27:01.036 --> 27:02.662
(laughs)

27:02.704 --> 27:05.541
Ladies and gentlemen,
the class of 2011.

27:05.583 --> 27:08.085
(applause)

27:17.595 --> 27:21.223
â™ª â™ª

27:40.658 --> 27:42.328
(clears throat)

27:42.369 --> 27:46.332
Hey, I need to get
back to the school.

27:46.373 --> 27:48.542
(sighs)
I can't believe they
made us take shuttles.

27:48.584 --> 27:50.169
Ridiculous.

27:50.210 --> 27:53.088
Well, you just missed one.

27:53.130 --> 27:55.341
So drive me now.

27:56.550 --> 27:59.512
Next shuttle leaves
in 15 minutes.

27:59.553 --> 28:01.847
15 minutes?

28:06.226 --> 28:07.853
(bus engine starts)

28:14.360 --> 28:15.569
(tires screeching)

28:19.114 --> 28:21.408
LIAM:
I'm sorry you missed the party.

28:21.450 --> 28:23.494
ANNIE:
Ugh, I'm not.

28:23.536 --> 28:25.245
Hey, how come
you didn't name the boat?

28:25.287 --> 28:29.124
I thought I knew what I
wanted to call it, but, uh...

28:29.166 --> 28:32.169
I changed my mind, so...

28:32.211 --> 28:33.671
I guess the future
is still unwritten.

28:33.711 --> 28:35.713
(dry chuckle)

28:37.132 --> 28:39.677
What are you
thinking?

28:39.718 --> 28:42.388
(sighs) I just-- I can't
believe that you're going to

28:42.429 --> 28:44.056
tell your stepfather
the truth.

28:44.097 --> 28:47.184
I mean,
it's going to be rough.

28:47.226 --> 28:49.019
Yeah.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.437
So why?

28:50.479 --> 28:53.732
I made a lot of
mistakes in the past.

28:53.773 --> 28:56.443
I've done drugs,
I've been violent.

28:56.485 --> 29:00.656
I didn't tell people the truth
about what happened with Jen.

29:00.698 --> 29:04.660
I'm really sorry
about that, I...

29:04.702 --> 29:06.745
But this year
has changed me.

29:06.786 --> 29:10.666
I became someone who really
wants to do the right thing.

29:10.708 --> 29:12.418
So yeah, yeah, it's
going to be tough

29:12.459 --> 29:15.421
when I confess,
but if I didn't,

29:15.462 --> 29:19.425
I don't know what
that would do to me.

29:19.466 --> 29:21.801
I don't think I'd be able
to live with myself.

29:24.846 --> 29:28.642
Yeah, well, you're
a better person than I am.

29:28.684 --> 29:30.310
(scoffs)

29:30.352 --> 29:32.438
Nah, you would
do the same thing

29:32.479 --> 29:33.813
if you were in my position.

29:33.855 --> 29:38.569
(sighs)
No, actually,
I've done far worse

29:38.611 --> 29:41.614
and I haven't come clean.

29:50.623 --> 29:53.375
I was the one

29:53.417 --> 29:56.211
who killed Joe Herman.

29:56.253 --> 29:59.590
Naomi had that prom
after party last year,

29:59.632 --> 30:01.258
and I was really upset

30:01.300 --> 30:04.386
and drunk.

30:04.428 --> 30:06.764
And I drove like that.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.724
I was coming down Mulholland

30:08.766 --> 30:10.601
when I hit something,

30:10.643 --> 30:12.352
and I just panicked.

30:12.394 --> 30:15.188
I didn't even get out
of the car.

30:15.230 --> 30:17.316
I couldn't get out of the car.

30:17.357 --> 30:20.360
I just drove home

30:20.402 --> 30:24.197
and secretly got the car
fixed the next morning,

30:24.239 --> 30:26.825
and I hoped that, you know,
it was a coyote or something.

30:28.410 --> 30:31.330
But it wasn't.

30:31.371 --> 30:33.206
I-I found out online

30:33.248 --> 30:37.461
that I had hit a person.

30:37.503 --> 30:38.545
A man.

30:40.506 --> 30:44.343
And-and he was in a coma

30:44.384 --> 30:45.844
and then he died.

30:48.430 --> 30:53.560
And his name...
his name was Joe Herman...

30:53.602 --> 30:57.439
and he was a... a human being

30:57.481 --> 30:59.483
and I killed him.

31:04.488 --> 31:06.156
(sobbing)

31:11.620 --> 31:12.954
(sniffs)

31:25.175 --> 31:27.927
â™ª â™ª

31:38.980 --> 31:41.233
(starter cranking, engine stalls
buzzer sounds )

31:42.860 --> 31:45.153
(starter cranking,
engine stalls, buzzer sounds)

31:45.195 --> 31:46.405
(sighs)

31:54.830 --> 31:55.831
What are
you doing?

31:55.873 --> 31:56.998
(chuckles)
Packing.

31:59.752 --> 32:02.713
Why are you staring
like that?

32:02.755 --> 32:05.257
What makes you think
you're going to Australia?

32:05.298 --> 32:08.051
Nobody said I couldn't.

32:08.093 --> 32:10.679
Oh, well, then let me
be clear-- you can't.

32:10.721 --> 32:12.347
What?!

32:12.389 --> 32:13.766
Dixon, when I said yes,

32:13.807 --> 32:16.226
I had no idea the trouble
that you'd gotten into.

32:16.268 --> 32:17.770
Mom, I've been planning
this for, for ages.

32:17.811 --> 32:19.438
I already promised Ivy.

32:19.479 --> 32:22.524
Look, this is an opportunity
for me to go to Australia.

32:22.566 --> 32:23.609
Please.
No.

32:25.485 --> 32:26.986
So what, I'm supposed
to stick around here

32:27.028 --> 32:28.697
all summer and listen
to you and Dad fight?

32:31.283 --> 32:33.535
The decision is
final, Dixon.

32:41.334 --> 32:42.920
(sighs)

32:42.961 --> 32:45.338
Where were you?

32:45.380 --> 32:47.591
I had a meeting with
the superintendent.

32:47.633 --> 32:49.843
At this time of night?
What were you doing?

32:49.885 --> 32:51.595
Getting fired.

32:51.637 --> 32:53.472
What?!

32:53.513 --> 32:55.181
There's some kid
in the senior class

32:55.223 --> 32:57.601
that tried to blackmail me
for trying to protect Dixon.

32:57.643 --> 33:00.061
And I had to go
to to Ms. Angus

33:00.103 --> 33:02.021
and tell her the truth;
it was the only thing to do.

33:04.608 --> 33:05.567
And they let me go.

33:05.609 --> 33:07.736
(sighs)

33:09.655 --> 33:11.156
Do you have anything
to say on the subject?

33:14.827 --> 33:16.745
Maybe you shouldn't have lied.

33:21.207 --> 33:24.336
That's all you have to say--
maybe I shouldn't have lied?

33:24.377 --> 33:27.088
I lose my job-- everything--
and all you can say is,

33:27.130 --> 33:28.590
maybe I shouldn't have lied?
You want some

33:28.632 --> 33:30.592
words of wisdom from me?
Some advice?

33:30.634 --> 33:31.760
Well, it's too late.

33:31.802 --> 33:33.720
Maybe you should have come to me

33:33.762 --> 33:35.138
before you made
our lives a total mess.

33:35.180 --> 33:37.683
I made a total mess
of our lives?
I was doing

33:37.724 --> 33:39.935
what I thought was right!
I was protecting our son!

33:39.977 --> 33:41.060
Who said that's
what Dixon needed?!

33:41.102 --> 33:43.897
What about consequences?
He needs to learn

33:43.939 --> 33:45.941
that actions have
consequences.

33:45.983 --> 33:47.484
And, yes, you,

33:47.526 --> 33:49.235
you did make a mess
of our lives.

33:49.277 --> 33:51.488
How can you say that?
Oh, God-- don't
you get it, Harry?

33:51.530 --> 33:53.490
We don't have anything!

33:53.532 --> 33:55.074
You don't have a job.
We don't have savings.

33:55.116 --> 33:57.828
And we don't love
each other anymore!

33:59.663 --> 34:01.373
Is that true?

34:01.414 --> 34:03.709
Is that true?

34:03.750 --> 34:04.960
You tell me.
You tell me.

34:05.002 --> 34:06.628
No, you tell me is that true!
No, you tell me!

34:06.670 --> 34:08.213
You look me in the eye,

34:08.254 --> 34:10.215
and you tell me
if you're still in love with me.

34:19.516 --> 34:20.766
Hey, you two.

34:22.936 --> 34:24.855
Uh...
Um...

34:24.897 --> 34:26.272
Hey.
Hey, Javier.
What's up?

34:27.815 --> 34:30.902
Adrianna... I just
wanted to talk to you.

34:30.944 --> 34:34.072
I know we're not
together anymore, but...

34:34.112 --> 34:36.074
I still think you're
incredibly talented.

34:36.114 --> 34:39.202
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, definitely...
No, well,

34:39.244 --> 34:41.830
the offer for you to go on tour
with me still stands.

34:41.871 --> 34:43.998
What? Really?

34:44.041 --> 34:45.918
You're good, Adrianna.

34:45.958 --> 34:48.085
Um...

34:48.127 --> 34:49.922
You should
do it, Ade.

34:49.963 --> 34:51.590
Yeah, it's a huge opportunity,

34:51.630 --> 34:53.382
and what better way
to spend your summer?

34:53.425 --> 34:54.885
Hey, I can go
with you.
Really?

34:54.927 --> 34:56.511
Yeah, we could
spend it together.

34:56.553 --> 34:59.389
Um... my tour's
not a summer tour.

34:59.431 --> 35:00.432
It's a whole year.

35:00.473 --> 35:02.809
Oh, um...

35:02.851 --> 35:04.603
Well, I'm still
in school.

35:04.644 --> 35:06.438
And why do people go to school?

35:06.479 --> 35:08.398
To get the
education they need

35:08.440 --> 35:10.025
to get the job
of their dreams.

35:10.067 --> 35:12.569
Adrianna, this is your dream,

35:12.611 --> 35:16.031
right here,
right now.

35:16.073 --> 35:18.617
I know it's not the safe move,
but come on.

35:18.658 --> 35:19.701
Take a risk.

35:21.870 --> 35:23.455
Maybe.

35:23.496 --> 35:24.748
(exhales)

35:29.669 --> 35:31.546
Hello?

35:32.965 --> 35:34.507
Hello?

35:36.593 --> 35:38.678
Oh... hey,

35:38.720 --> 35:41.431
Mr. Cannon.
Hi.

35:41.473 --> 35:43.892
Um, my car won't start.

35:43.934 --> 35:45.811
Who knew that could be a problem

35:45.852 --> 35:47.312
in the modern
era, right?

35:47.353 --> 35:49.022
Apparently there are cars
that don't start.

35:49.064 --> 35:51.817
And my cell phone
died, so I just,

35:51.858 --> 35:55.821
um, need to borrow someone's
phone to call AAA.

35:55.862 --> 35:57.489
I didn't know it
was you here, so...

35:57.530 --> 35:58.782
Is everything okay, Naomi?

36:05.789 --> 36:08.333
No, it's not.

36:16.842 --> 36:18.760
Everything is not okay.

36:20.804 --> 36:23.389
Everything is wrong.

36:24.808 --> 36:26.726
And it's all
my fault.

36:30.730 --> 36:32.649
Because I'm self-centered.

36:32.691 --> 36:34.943
I'm a liar.

36:34.985 --> 36:38.030
I'm a terrible person.
No.

36:38.071 --> 36:39.781
No, you're not
a terrible person.

36:39.823 --> 36:41.033
How can you say that?

36:41.074 --> 36:42.534
I almost ruined your life.

36:42.575 --> 36:44.536
But you didn't.

36:48.540 --> 36:50.125
Would you like

36:50.167 --> 36:51.459
a glass of water?

36:51.501 --> 36:54.004
Yeah.

36:58.675 --> 37:00.301
(bus engine idling)

37:16.985 --> 37:18.361
(car engine starts)

37:28.788 --> 37:30.665
â™ª â™ª

37:37.630 --> 37:38.715
(crashing)

37:50.769 --> 37:52.979
Are you sure you don't
want me to go in with you?

37:53.021 --> 37:54.898
I have to do this alone.

37:56.858 --> 37:58.944
Well, I'm sleeping
on my boat, um,

37:58.985 --> 38:01.362
you know, to enjoy my
last night of freedom.

38:01.404 --> 38:03.031
I don't know if I'll get
cell reception out there,

38:03.073 --> 38:05.283
but if you need me,

38:05.324 --> 38:06.659
you know where to find me.

38:06.701 --> 38:08.203
Thank you.

38:35.647 --> 38:38.441
Mom, Dad,

38:38.483 --> 38:40.318
I have something that
I have to tell you.

38:44.281 --> 38:46.158
â™ª â™ª

39:04.134 --> 39:06.636
(explosion)

39:16.646 --> 39:18.064
â™ª â™ª

39:29.201 --> 39:31.203
(coughs)

39:31.244 --> 39:33.496
(sirens approaching)

39:39.752 --> 39:42.172
MR. CANNON (on TV):
The animal kingdom is brutal.

39:42.214 --> 39:45.008
But no animal is as brutal
as the Homo sapien.

39:47.260 --> 39:50.889
Anyway, it goes on and on
and on like that.

39:50.930 --> 39:52.891
Well, it's an amazing project.

39:54.309 --> 39:55.894
I'm really impressed, seriously.

39:55.935 --> 39:57.770
Oh, well, I'm, I'm glad.

39:57.812 --> 40:00.899
So, um... I'm not just some
boring, old bastard, then?

40:00.940 --> 40:03.860
Of course not. No.

40:03.902 --> 40:06.321
I mean, you're talented.

40:06.363 --> 40:08.740
Ah, you're just
saying that.
No.

40:08.781 --> 40:09.991
Thank you.

40:10.033 --> 40:11.492
Means a lot to me.

40:14.787 --> 40:18.457
Um... well,

40:18.499 --> 40:21.044
it's seems like a very
important documentary.

40:21.086 --> 40:23.713
Thank you.

40:23.755 --> 40:25.882
You don't mind me
holding your hand, do you?

40:25.924 --> 40:28.801
No, that's... no.

40:28.843 --> 40:29.594
It's fine.

40:32.597 --> 40:33.765
I should probably
call AAA though, because...

40:34.933 --> 40:37.018
Mr. Cannon!

40:37.060 --> 40:38.103
Oh, come on.

40:39.812 --> 40:41.314
It's okay. I know you
wanted me to kiss you.

40:41.356 --> 40:42.815
You don't have to feel guilty.

40:42.857 --> 40:44.234
What? I don't feel guilty.

40:44.276 --> 40:45.818
I don't want
you to kiss me.

40:45.860 --> 40:47.237
Enough, Naomi.

40:47.279 --> 40:48.905
Enough

40:48.947 --> 40:50.365
with the teasing.

40:50.407 --> 40:52.284
I see the way you look at me.

40:52.325 --> 40:53.410
And your whole
harassment fantasy?

40:53.451 --> 40:55.620
You're trying to provoke me.

40:55.661 --> 40:57.872
And now that you have, you're
going to play the innocent?

40:57.914 --> 40:59.958
Don't bother.

40:59.999 --> 41:02.210
I know you want me to.

41:02.252 --> 41:03.586
Get away from me, you perv.

41:09.301 --> 41:10.969
Stop it!
Stop or I will tell.

41:11.010 --> 41:12.304
Stop!
Who're you going to tell?

41:12.345 --> 41:14.889
Who're you going
to tell, hmm?

41:14.931 --> 41:17.142
Hmm?

41:17.183 --> 41:18.977
Who's going
to believe you?

41:20.895 --> 41:23.522
You're the girl
who cried wolf.
