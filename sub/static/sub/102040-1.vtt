WEBVTT

03:24.864 --> 03:28.100
I would like
to invite all who are present here

03:28.134 --> 03:35.507
to take a moment to call to
mind, our need for forgiveness.

03:37.810 --> 03:38.878
Let us pray.

05:37.129 --> 05:37.897
Chef.

05:43.601 --> 05:45.972
Welcome.
I'm Willem Faust.

05:46.005 --> 05:48.140
Ecanus.
I like that.

05:49.275 --> 05:51.143
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

05:53.012 --> 05:56.716
So, tell me,
is that your real name?

05:56.749 --> 05:57.549
Yeah.

05:58.718 --> 06:01.087
It's very fitting,
wouldn't you say?

06:01.120 --> 06:02.587
Fate, I guess.

06:03.689 --> 06:05.992
I think so.
Please, take a seat.

06:11.931 --> 06:15.668
Well, tell me a little bit
about yourself.

06:17.937 --> 06:20.039
Um, I've been cooking
since I was a kid.

06:20.072 --> 06:20.940
Mm-hmm.

06:20.973 --> 06:22.775
Uh, my grandmas,
uh, taught me how to make

06:22.808 --> 06:24.677
- traditional Mexican dishes...
- Yes.

06:24.710 --> 06:27.847
...which has become a passion
for all kinds of foods.

06:27.880 --> 06:30.149
Um, I specialize
in Mediterranean,

06:30.182 --> 06:33.219
Indo-Asian infusion,
uh, several types of...

06:33.252 --> 06:34.954
No, please, Chef, stop.

06:36.022 --> 06:36.822
I don't care.

06:37.923 --> 06:40.860
Well, I do, but I already know.

06:42.228 --> 06:43.195
I've talked to your
previous kitchens

06:43.229 --> 06:45.264
and they all say the same thing.

06:45.297 --> 06:47.199
"Chef is a Creative
Tour de Force.

06:47.233 --> 06:49.869
He's fast. He's reliable."

06:49.902 --> 06:51.871
We could skip the foreplay.

06:51.904 --> 06:53.739
Yeah, okay.

06:53.773 --> 06:55.041
I just want to know the man
who I'm trusting

06:55.074 --> 06:56.541
to make my customers happy.

06:57.810 --> 07:00.946
Of course, yeah.
Well, what do you want to know?

07:00.980 --> 07:02.181
Tell me about your family.

07:03.282 --> 07:05.651
Well, um, I'm Mexican.

07:05.684 --> 07:06.618
Mm-hmm.

07:07.453 --> 07:09.088
Um, I'm very close
with my family.

07:10.122 --> 07:14.894
Uh, I live with my parents,
my siblings, my Abuela,

07:14.927 --> 07:18.798
and every Sunday, we get
together with all the cousins.

07:19.965 --> 07:21.801
So family is important to you
then?

07:21.834 --> 07:22.835
Yes.

07:22.868 --> 07:25.071
The most important thing
actually.

07:25.104 --> 07:26.872
Well and food, obviously.

07:28.007 --> 07:29.141
Good.

07:29.175 --> 07:31.911
Well, a family man
is a trustworthy man.

07:33.813 --> 07:36.982
Uh, my next question is one
that I hate to ask, but I must.

07:37.016 --> 07:38.350
Okay.

07:38.384 --> 07:39.785
Are you here legally?

07:39.819 --> 07:40.618
Yes.

07:42.188 --> 07:44.090
And what about your family?

07:48.694 --> 07:51.897
I'm sorry, I don't understand
what that has to do-

07:51.931 --> 07:52.731
I don't mean to pry,

07:52.765 --> 07:54.800
but as you might be
able to tell,

07:54.834 --> 07:56.735
I'm an immigrant myself.

07:59.672 --> 08:00.773
Well, um...

08:03.209 --> 08:06.112
My parents and Abuela
don't have papers.

08:08.080 --> 08:10.216
I understand.

08:10.249 --> 08:12.651
That must put some pressure
on you and your family.

08:13.786 --> 08:14.787
Sometimes.

08:17.723 --> 08:20.659
I think you're gonna fit in
very well here.

08:20.693 --> 08:22.394
The previous chef
was a little too...

08:24.964 --> 08:27.199
you know, sometimes
we have high turnover rates,

08:27.233 --> 08:29.668
but don't let that be a source
of concern to you.

08:29.702 --> 08:31.036
So it's about finding
the right people

08:31.070 --> 08:34.240
and that's no easy task
in the restaurant business.

08:34.273 --> 08:36.107
This isn't a job for everyone.

08:36.142 --> 08:36.842
It can be grueling.

08:36.876 --> 08:40.312
Mr. Faust,
I wouldn't be here

08:40.346 --> 08:42.214
if I didn't know what
I was going to sign up for.

08:44.150 --> 08:46.385
Well, that's all I need to know.

08:47.419 --> 08:49.021
Let's make this official,
shall we?

08:55.427 --> 08:56.996
Here is your home
away from home.

08:58.264 --> 09:00.232
It may not look like much,

09:00.266 --> 09:02.034
but my kitchens
are a little different.

09:04.036 --> 09:06.305
I believe in equality, Chef,

09:06.338 --> 09:08.707
every person an essential part
of my operation.

09:10.843 --> 09:14.280
As a result,
there's no real hierarchy.

09:16.015 --> 09:18.217
Sous chefs are equal
to the preppers

09:18.250 --> 09:21.153
and you are no more important
than our washes

09:21.187 --> 09:23.289
because we all fail

09:23.322 --> 09:26.892
if someone doesn't do their job,
wouldn't you agree?

09:26.926 --> 09:27.860
You're absolutely right.

09:29.328 --> 09:32.464
This is Michael,
my kitchen manager,

09:32.498 --> 09:34.300
and also my right hand.

09:40.072 --> 09:43.042
He makes sure things get done,
takes care of any issues.

09:44.810 --> 09:47.446
He'll pop in from time to time,
and keep an eye on things.

09:47.479 --> 09:49.148
But if you have any questions,

09:49.181 --> 09:50.916
I want you to come
directly to me.

09:50.950 --> 09:51.817
Okay.

09:51.850 --> 09:54.153
I work very closely
with my employees.

09:54.186 --> 09:56.188
You're the lifeblood
of my operation.

09:56.222 --> 09:57.456
We are a family.

09:58.824 --> 09:59.858
Sounds great.

09:59.892 --> 10:02.261
Right, you ready to go to work?

10:02.294 --> 10:03.262
Oh, now?

10:03.295 --> 10:04.763
Well, that's what
we're here to do, isn't it?

10:04.797 --> 10:09.768
Oh, well, yeah, let's do it.

10:09.802 --> 10:10.769
Let's cook.

10:25.884 --> 10:26.986
- 16 feet.
- Really.

10:27.019 --> 10:28.354
I mean, the poor lady, she...

10:28.387 --> 10:31.557
poor lady, she almost vomited
all over the table.

10:31.590 --> 10:33.459
I guess some cropped up knees
is better than having

10:33.492 --> 10:35.261
- a dead grandma in your.
- Oh, exactly.

10:36.962 --> 10:38.330
Well, I'm just lucky
it didn't make the news.

10:38.364 --> 10:40.432
No, no, no, I got...

10:40.466 --> 10:42.801
- got a better one for you.
- Gon on, tell me.

10:42.835 --> 10:46.138
So, I walk in, okay,
this is my Persian friend?

10:46.171 --> 10:48.907
I walk in,
he's just butt naked,

10:48.941 --> 10:49.743
- just sitting there.
- No.

10:49.775 --> 10:51.377
And I'm just like,
what is going on?

10:51.410 --> 10:52.911
Come on.

11:54.606 --> 11:58.377
Ana! Ana! Ana!

11:58.410 --> 12:00.245
Ana! Mijo!

13:22.394 --> 13:23.262
What?

13:24.396 --> 13:27.132
What do you mean,
'What?' Come on! Out with it.

13:32.037 --> 13:35.675
So, tell us, Chef.
Tell us about the restaurant.

13:36.341 --> 13:39.211
It's beautiful.
Really beautiful.

13:39.244 --> 13:41.681
It's in the mountains and

13:41.714 --> 13:45.017
has an incredible view.

13:45.584 --> 13:47.286
How much they're paying you?

13:47.319 --> 13:48.688
Stop it, Daniel.

13:50.222 --> 13:51.658
And your boss?
How's he?

13:53.091 --> 13:54.326
His name is Faust.

13:56.729 --> 14:01.066
He's a great guy.
Amazing and very generous.

14:01.099 --> 14:03.335
He already has 10 restaurants
and wants to open even more.

14:05.070 --> 14:06.739
Must pay you a lot, huh?

14:08.373 --> 14:10.209
And your work schedule?

14:12.779 --> 14:17.516
It's only open for
dinner so I'll usually work late nights

14:17.549 --> 14:21.320
but today I have to go in early
because

14:21.353 --> 14:24.623
they have a little initiation
or my first night.

14:24.958 --> 14:26.693
Wow.

14:26.726 --> 14:29.161
Your father
is going to be so proud of you.

14:29.194 --> 14:30.295
You should call him.

14:32.431 --> 14:34.099
I will.

14:34.132 --> 14:36.101
So can I come to the restaurant?

14:36.134 --> 14:38.570
Dude, dude, you can't afford it.

14:41.440 --> 14:42.574
Shut up, Lulu.

14:42.608 --> 14:44.376
Mom, what's the matter?

14:44.409 --> 14:46.578
Nothing, I'm just so proud
of my grandson.

14:50.683 --> 14:52.518
I remember when you were little.

14:52.551 --> 14:55.521
All you ever wanted to do
was help.

15:00.459 --> 15:02.261
I have been waiting
for the right moment

15:02.294 --> 15:03.362
to give this to you

15:03.395 --> 15:05.364
and now you have earned it.

15:05.397 --> 15:06.733
This is for you.

15:13.138 --> 15:14.239
(Do you like it?)

15:14.273 --> 15:16.408
Yes!
Thank you so much. Thank you.

15:19.411 --> 15:21.213
Thank you, Grandma.

15:24.516 --> 15:25.818
(I've got to head out, ok?)

15:30.322 --> 15:32.224
- Can you give me a ride?
- Yeah.

15:32.257 --> 15:34.259
I don't want you
driving through the mountains.

15:34.293 --> 15:35.360
It's fine, Mom.

15:36.161 --> 15:38.297
Come right back!

15:45.738 --> 15:47.105
I'm serious, Daniel!

15:47.139 --> 15:49.742
I need the car back
in time for my meetings tonight!

15:49.776 --> 15:51.476
I heard you, Mom.

16:00.586 --> 16:01.654
Don't touch my radio.

16:01.688 --> 16:03.555
Put it back.

16:03.589 --> 16:06.358
Are you serious?

16:06.391 --> 16:07.259
Nah, man.

16:08.928 --> 16:10.730
I was just about to say, man,
you're turning into dad.

16:40.927 --> 16:42.394
Settle down, everyone.

16:42.427 --> 16:43.796
Listen up.

16:43.830 --> 16:46.899
Settle down.

16:46.933 --> 16:49.836
As most of you might well be
aware tonight,

16:49.869 --> 16:54.339
we are welcoming a new addition
to our family.

16:54.373 --> 16:58.811
His name, well,
his name is Chef.

17:00.647 --> 17:01.480
Sup, Chef?

17:01.513 --> 17:02.882
I'm a dishwasher.

17:02.915 --> 17:04.415
Are you...

17:04.449 --> 17:06.184
Seeing as
this is his first night,

17:06.218 --> 17:08.220
we must give him
a warm traditional welcome

17:08.252 --> 17:10.589
by throwing him into the fire.

17:10.622 --> 17:12.223
You all know the drill.

17:12.257 --> 17:14.259
Whatever he says tonight, goes.

17:15.627 --> 17:16.628
Are you nervous?

17:16.663 --> 17:17.797
Should I be?

17:19.498 --> 17:22.467
Chef, in all of the world,

17:22.501 --> 17:26.338
what is your absolute
most favorite dish to eat?

17:26.371 --> 17:28.473
I don't know, um...

17:28.507 --> 17:30.242
Uh, a cheeseburger.

17:30.275 --> 17:31.811
Cheeseburger?

17:31.844 --> 17:33.478
- Come on, man!
- Hey, hey, hang on.

17:33.512 --> 17:35.280
- Who threw that?
- Get outta here.

17:36.515 --> 17:40.385
All right, everyone,
Chef says a cheeseburger.

17:40.419 --> 17:41.620
Survey says?

17:41.654 --> 17:43.221
No.

17:43.255 --> 17:44.057
Come on, dude.

17:44.090 --> 17:44.791
We're not gonna make
a cheeseburger?.

17:44.824 --> 17:45.925
You know where we are?

17:45.958 --> 17:46.893
All right.

17:46.926 --> 17:48.628
Second try.

17:48.661 --> 17:52.497
Grilled chicken curry,
with mango chutney

17:52.531 --> 17:55.233
and basmati rice.

17:55.267 --> 17:56.669
- Mm, nah, nah, not quite.
- Nah.

17:56.703 --> 17:57.637
- Almost.
- Not there yet.

17:59.739 --> 18:02.607
All right, I've got it.

18:02.642 --> 18:06.278
We start
with Wagyu Beef Tartare,

18:06.311 --> 18:09.281
and follow it with Muscovy duck,

18:09.314 --> 18:16.789
laded with a turnip puree
in a light citrus jus.

18:16.823 --> 18:17.556
- Okay.
- Nice.

18:17.589 --> 18:18.157
- Yes.
- Wow.

18:18.191 --> 18:19.324
Survey says?

18:19.357 --> 18:20.193
- All right, Chef.
- Yes.

18:20.225 --> 18:20.827
- Definitely.
- Yeah, let's do this.

18:20.860 --> 18:21.560
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.

18:21.593 --> 18:21.928
So much better.

18:21.961 --> 18:23.796
All right.

18:23.830 --> 18:25.965
Tonight's special,
Beef Wagyu Tartare

18:25.998 --> 18:27.633
and Muscovy duck, it is.

18:27.667 --> 18:28.600
Let's get cooking.

18:28.634 --> 18:29.702
- Whoo!
- Good.

18:44.650 --> 18:46.485
- Hey are you Mexican?
- Yeah.

18:46.518 --> 18:48.888
Me too.
I'm Rodrigo.

18:48.921 --> 18:49.889
Dishwasher, right?

18:49.922 --> 18:51.289
Nah, just that night.

18:51.323 --> 18:52.759
I'm a sushi chef in the day.

18:52.792 --> 18:53.960
Wow.

18:53.993 --> 18:55.895
World's first Mexican
sushi chef.

18:55.928 --> 18:57.063
Nah,.

18:57.096 --> 18:58.463
I come from a whole family
of them.

18:58.497 --> 18:59.564
Why don't you do it here?

18:59.598 --> 19:01.000
No, I'm not good enough
for here.

19:01.033 --> 19:02.101
My cousin, Gary, is though.

19:02.135 --> 19:04.070
I've been trying to get him
to work here forever.

19:04.103 --> 19:05.905
So, Chef, what's...
what's your real name?

19:05.938 --> 19:08.007
What's the story there?

19:08.040 --> 19:10.009
Yeah, so, uh, my name
was supposed to be Alejandro,

19:10.042 --> 19:11.409
but when...

19:13.880 --> 19:15.480
Get back to work.

19:20.019 --> 19:20.653
We'll chat later.

19:20.686 --> 19:22.789
We have to get back to work.

19:22.822 --> 19:24.824
- Right.
- Have fun?

19:30.495 --> 19:31.731
Order up!

19:33.866 --> 19:35.635
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

19:35.668 --> 19:37.036
Yeah, we know!

20:06.598 --> 20:08.668
Chef?

20:08.701 --> 20:09.969
Can I speak to you
for a minute?

20:10.002 --> 20:11.336
Yeah.

20:19.045 --> 20:21.981
So, what did you
think of your first night?

20:24.717 --> 20:25.517
It was great.

20:27.153 --> 20:28.386
Why?

20:28.420 --> 20:30.589
The staff was incredible.

20:30.622 --> 20:32.892
Th... they were fast
and creative.

20:32.925 --> 20:36.796
I just never seen anything
like that.

20:36.829 --> 20:38.530
Do you feel like you
belong here?

20:39.866 --> 20:41.667
I think so.

20:41.701 --> 20:42.835
How can you tell?

20:44.136 --> 20:48.406
Well, I don't really
make friends that easy.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.042
But tonight, you did.

20:50.076 --> 20:52.111
Yeah.

20:52.144 --> 20:53.846
Rodrigo.

20:54.780 --> 20:55.715
Yeah.

20:56.949 --> 20:59.886
He's one of my favorites too.

20:59.919 --> 21:02.121
You know, when I first came
to this country,

21:02.154 --> 21:04.657
I was all alone.

21:04.690 --> 21:06.893
Desperate.

21:06.926 --> 21:08.928
I opened my first restaurant,

21:08.961 --> 21:12.564
and experienced
an ungodly amount of resistance.

21:12.597 --> 21:14.901
You will not believe
the amount of people

21:14.934 --> 21:17.435
who tried to deny me, Chef,

21:17.469 --> 21:21.040
who betrayed me,
one after another,

21:21.073 --> 21:24.542
investors, partners, customers.

21:25.912 --> 21:32.584
So, I decided to go out
on my own, to trust no one,

21:32.617 --> 21:36.088
to rely on my own two hands,
and my passion for food.

21:38.490 --> 21:40.726
And guess what?

21:40.760 --> 21:42.494
The rest is history.

21:44.496 --> 21:45.765
No, Chef.

21:47.633 --> 21:49.434
I was destroyed on my own.

21:51.070 --> 21:53.605
This world is not kind of
individuals fighting alone

21:53.639 --> 21:56.075
to survive.

21:56.108 --> 22:00.913
Success depends
on collaboration,

22:00.947 --> 22:05.517
interdependence, persistence.

22:05.550 --> 22:08.620
But there is a caveat.

22:08.654 --> 22:10.156
As I've said before,

22:10.189 --> 22:11.190
it's all about
surrounding yourself

22:11.223 --> 22:13.926
with the right people.

22:13.960 --> 22:17.830
If a person has nothing
to offer, just cut them loose.

22:17.863 --> 22:22.768
I cannot understand
why people are so fearful

22:22.802 --> 22:27.605
to let go
of toxic relationships,

22:27.640 --> 22:32.610
and find your family,
the ones that matter,

22:32.645 --> 22:33.946
the Rodrigos.

22:35.815 --> 22:37.717
And burn the rest.

22:41.220 --> 22:42.955
Don't you worry about
burning a bridge

22:42.989 --> 22:45.291
you might later want to cross?

22:45.324 --> 22:46.491
Never.

22:55.901 --> 22:57.770
Would you mind excusing me
for a moment?

22:57.803 --> 22:59.238
Yeah, of course.

23:08.914 --> 23:13.585
Oh, and Chef,
in case you were wondering,

23:13.618 --> 23:15.654
you do belong here.

23:23.195 --> 23:25.197
<i>Breaking news

23:37.309 --> 23:39.011

<i>...many as 60

23:40.946 --> 23:42.048

24:35.968 --> 24:38.304
Are we going to be ok?

24:38.337 --> 24:40.172
Of course.

24:40.206 --> 24:42.641
Mama.
They could come here tonight.

24:42.675 --> 24:45.277
They won't come here.

24:45.311 --> 24:47.213
There aren't that many of us.

24:47.246 --> 24:51.884
There aren't many of us,
but most are illegals.

24:51.917 --> 24:54.320
They came and took Mr. Lopez
last night.

24:54.353 --> 24:56.822
What?

24:56.856 --> 24:58.090
Yeah, I'm not
sure, but I think so.

25:00.759 --> 25:02.128
I could get a job.

25:02.161 --> 25:04.163
- Nah, Daniel, nah.
- What? No.

25:04.196 --> 25:06.031
You need to go to school, man.

25:07.433 --> 25:08.934
Listen...

25:12.138 --> 25:13.405
I'll talk with my boss to see

25:13.439 --> 25:17.209
if I can pick up
some extra shifts.

25:17.243 --> 25:19.445
Okay?

25:19.478 --> 25:22.815
You can't make enough
to pay three fees.

25:24.750 --> 25:26.318
What choice do I have?

25:37.863 --> 25:39.398
My God.

25:48.774 --> 25:50.976
We need to pray.

26:25.277 --> 26:27.746
Thanks for meeting with me,
Mr. Faust.

26:29.014 --> 26:30.115
Of course.

26:30.149 --> 26:31.317
Soon,
we'll start scheduling chats

26:31.350 --> 26:33.419
and reserving our end table.

26:33.452 --> 26:35.187
Yeah.

26:35.221 --> 26:39.491
Um, this may not be
the conversation

26:39.525 --> 26:40.326
you were expecting.

26:40.359 --> 26:44.964
It's kind of hard for me
to bring up.

26:44.997 --> 26:46.865
- Are you quitting?
- No.

26:46.899 --> 26:48.968
No.

26:49.001 --> 26:50.069
Actually, the opposite.

26:50.102 --> 26:53.539
I was wondering
if I could pick up

26:53.572 --> 26:57.176
some extra shifts?

26:57.209 --> 26:58.410
Is everything okay?

27:02.248 --> 27:04.083
Does this have something to do
with yesterday's...

27:04.116 --> 27:05.451
Yeah.

27:13.892 --> 27:16.495
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Chef.

27:16.528 --> 27:18.197
You don't need
to be embarrassed.

27:18.230 --> 27:20.866
This is your family
we're talking about.

27:20.899 --> 27:23.135
Instead of picking up
extra shifts,

27:23.168 --> 27:26.171
how about I give you a raise?

27:26.205 --> 27:27.473
What?

27:27.506 --> 27:28.374
No.

27:28.407 --> 27:31.143
No, I... I can't accept that,
Mr. Faust.

27:31.176 --> 27:33.078
I... I just barely started
working here.

27:33.112 --> 27:34.280
I wanna pay my dues.

27:34.313 --> 27:36.815
- I need to pay my...
- I'm serious.

27:36.849 --> 27:38.117
This isn't some kind of
hollow offer I'm hoping

27:38.150 --> 27:40.085
you'll refuse.

27:40.119 --> 27:42.588
I need to make sure
you're provided for.

27:42.621 --> 27:44.156
Your home life
isn't a distraction

27:44.189 --> 27:45.324
to your work here.

27:52.464 --> 27:56.001
I don't know how to thank you,
Mr. Faust.

27:56.035 --> 27:57.202
Don't worry about it.

27:59.138 --> 28:01.073
I'm sure you'll be able
to return the favor soon.

28:01.106 --> 28:02.608
You know I would do anything.

28:02.642 --> 28:05.077
Really, Mr. Faust,
thank you so much.

28:06.912 --> 28:08.414
You're welcome.

28:08.447 --> 28:10.082
All right.

28:10.115 --> 28:11.850
It's early,
so gotta get washed up,

28:11.884 --> 28:13.052
and get started, yeah?

29:06.639 --> 29:08.107
What's going on?

29:10.943 --> 29:11.910
You know.

29:15.547 --> 29:17.316
My dad just texted me.

29:20.619 --> 29:22.187
He somehow got word,
and my amigo as well

29:22.221 --> 29:24.657
and through our neighborhood
the next couple days.

29:24.691 --> 29:26.693
How'd he hear that?

29:26.726 --> 29:28.093
I don't know.

29:31.130 --> 29:32.531
What are you gonna do?

29:38.437 --> 29:40.472
I don't know, man.

29:40.506 --> 29:41.540
I've just been thinking
about it all day.

29:41.573 --> 29:45.944
It's just finally hittin' home.

29:47.246 --> 29:48.414
Could you run?

29:48.447 --> 29:50.549
No way.

29:50.582 --> 29:53.452
There's too many of us.

29:53.485 --> 29:57.690
I mean, like young kids,
grandparents,

29:57.724 --> 29:59.425
we can't go nowhere.

30:03.529 --> 30:07.266
I'm sorry, man.

30:07.299 --> 30:10.335
It don't matter.

30:10.369 --> 30:12.571
It's just wrong though, you
know?

30:12.604 --> 30:15.974
Like, my whole life is here.

30:19.211 --> 30:21.413
I talked to Faust today about
pickin' up extra shifts.

30:21.447 --> 30:24.249
You sh...
you should talk to him.

30:24.283 --> 30:27.386
I've been picking up
those "extra shifts"

30:27.419 --> 30:28.387
for a few weeks now.

30:31.256 --> 30:33.091
You're gonna try to pay the fee?

30:35.494 --> 30:39.064
We'll see,
if I can make enough in time.

30:39.097 --> 30:41.099
Yeah.

30:41.133 --> 30:42.702
Same here.

30:46.806 --> 30:49.274
When you talked to Faust
about picking up extra shifts,

30:49.308 --> 30:53.646
what did...
what did he say?

30:53.680 --> 30:55.247
He said yes.

30:58.283 --> 31:00.319
I... actually, I probably
shouldn't be telling you this,

31:00.352 --> 31:03.656
but he just gave me
a raise instead.

31:06.525 --> 31:09.696
He just like, increased
your paycheck or something?

31:09.729 --> 31:11.631
Yeah, I guess.

31:13.398 --> 31:14.433
Hmm.

31:17.637 --> 31:19.104
Are you leaving?

31:19.137 --> 31:20.072
No.

31:20.105 --> 31:23.275
But my parents and Abuela are.

31:23.308 --> 31:25.344
That's why.

31:25.377 --> 31:26.478
What's why?

31:29.481 --> 31:32.184
Nothing.

31:32.217 --> 31:33.786
You know,
before I started working here,

31:35.554 --> 31:37.456
I heard Faust was a racist.

31:40.158 --> 31:42.461
I... I... I don't know.

31:44.731 --> 31:49.201
But if he's helping my family,
so like...

31:49.234 --> 31:50.269
It's just what I heard
from my friend

31:50.302 --> 31:52.739
that got me the job.

31:52.772 --> 31:55.107
Don't matter though.

31:55.140 --> 31:57.209
If he ever crossed the line...

31:57.242 --> 31:59.712
What?

31:59.746 --> 32:02.649
Let's just say my family's
not the type to go quietly.

32:09.454 --> 32:10.222
Good night, Chef.

32:10.255 --> 32:11.056
Good night.

32:11.089 --> 32:12.725
Good night, Chef.

32:12.759 --> 32:14.359
Good work, guys.

32:19.766 --> 32:20.733
Chef.

32:20.767 --> 32:22.501
Yeah?

32:22.534 --> 32:23.870
Can I have a word?

32:23.903 --> 32:25.137
Yeah.

32:35.314 --> 32:36.615
Take a seat.

32:41.219 --> 32:42.855
How much money do you need?

32:42.889 --> 32:44.590
What?

32:44.623 --> 32:48.260
- Exactly how much do you need?
- Why?

32:48.293 --> 32:50.495
How many members of your family
to pay the fee?

32:52.799 --> 32:54.366
Three.

32:55.500 --> 32:57.770
So, that's $60,000, right?

32:57.804 --> 33:00.305
Yeah.

33:00.339 --> 33:02.742
Okay.

33:02.775 --> 33:05.210
I can help you.

33:05.243 --> 33:06.511
- You already are.
- It's...

33:06.545 --> 33:08.547
No, I mean really help you.

33:08.580 --> 33:09.414
How would you like to pay

33:09.448 --> 33:10.582
for one of your
family member's fees

33:10.616 --> 33:11.884
by tomorrow morning?

33:15.855 --> 33:17.422
How?

33:17.456 --> 33:19.324
You have your driver's license,
right?

33:19.358 --> 33:21.593
Yeah, but I don't have a car.

33:21.628 --> 33:23.730
It's okay.
You don't need one.

33:23.763 --> 33:25.297
All you need to do
is pick up a car

33:25.330 --> 33:29.368
from across town,
drive it to a specific address,

33:29.401 --> 33:30.737
and leave it here.

33:30.770 --> 33:33.873
If you do this for me,
I'll pay you $20,000.

33:36.943 --> 33:38.645
Are you joking?

33:38.678 --> 33:39.578
No, I'm being very serious.

33:39.611 --> 33:40.813
I mean, I can't pay you that
every time.

33:40.847 --> 33:42.715
I mean, it sounds illegal.

33:46.618 --> 33:48.688
There's nothing illegal
about driving a car.

33:48.721 --> 33:49.922
I mean, you have
a driver's license,

33:49.956 --> 33:52.659
and you can consider yourself
a valet.

33:52.692 --> 33:53.893
But what am I delivering?

33:53.926 --> 33:54.827
Just a car.

33:54.861 --> 33:56.663
What's in the car?

33:59.498 --> 34:02.300
Chef, I'm literally just asking
you to pick up a car

34:02.334 --> 34:04.436
and drop it off
in another place.

34:04.469 --> 34:08.306
Yeah, but it's...
it's $20,000.

34:08.340 --> 34:09.809
That seems pretty easy just
to...

34:09.842 --> 34:14.212
You consider it a signing bonus
for doing me a favor.

34:14.246 --> 34:15.380
And in return,
I'm trying to do you

34:15.414 --> 34:18.751
and your family a favor.

34:18.784 --> 34:20.217
I need the assurance
that my best chef

34:20.252 --> 34:22.219
isn't going anywhere
because his family

34:22.254 --> 34:23.522
has been broken up.

34:26.291 --> 34:27.659
Do you not believe me?

34:29.829 --> 34:30.862
I... I don't...

34:30.897 --> 34:32.632
Here's $10,000.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.936
Do this for me,
and by tomorrow morning,

34:36.969 --> 34:38.536
you'll get the rest.

34:42.708 --> 34:44.309
I can't accept that, Mr. Faust.

34:44.342 --> 34:46.679
You have to provide, Chef.

34:46.713 --> 34:47.612
What?

34:47.647 --> 34:49.246
Provide.

34:49.281 --> 34:51.449
Provide for your family.

34:51.483 --> 34:53.518
Because tomorrow,
you might wake up,

34:53.552 --> 34:55.487
and your parents
and your grandmother

34:55.520 --> 34:59.257
are on their way back to Mexico.

34:59.291 --> 35:02.729
You're their protector,
their provider.

35:05.064 --> 35:07.265
You're the family man, right?

35:13.371 --> 35:15.440
There's only one rule.

35:15.474 --> 35:17.877
Never open the trunk.

35:17.910 --> 35:20.278
Got it?

35:20.312 --> 35:23.716
On this piece of paper
is an address.

35:23.750 --> 35:25.317
Don't put it into your phone.

35:25.350 --> 35:26.986
Don't search for it.

35:27.019 --> 35:29.421
Just give it to your driver.

35:29.454 --> 35:30.823
Here is fine.

35:46.873 --> 35:49.574
When you arrive
at this location,

35:49.608 --> 35:52.344
there will be a silver car
in the parking garage.

35:53.478 --> 35:55.014
Go to it.

36:15.134 --> 36:18.871
Behind the front left wheel
of the car, you'll find a box.

36:23.075 --> 36:24.977
Inside the box is a key.

36:36.923 --> 36:41.359
Get into the car,
and open the center console.

36:41.393 --> 36:42.662
There, you'll find
another piece of paper

36:42.695 --> 36:44.429
with an address on it.

36:47.667 --> 36:50.136
Drive to the destination.

36:50.169 --> 36:52.939
You will need to arrive
before 1:30 AM.

37:55.101 --> 37:56.702
Hey, man,
you're in the right place.

37:56.736 --> 37:58.603
Sorry it's so late.

38:02.174 --> 38:03.109
I really appreciate you comin'.

38:03.142 --> 38:03.876
Yeah.

38:03.910 --> 38:05.477
Hey, thanks a lot.

38:05.510 --> 38:06.946
Hey, babe, let's go.

40:24.316 --> 40:25.851
<i>Last
night an estimated 600 illegal immigrants</i>

40:25.885 --> 40:28.087
<i>were rounded up
in neighborhoods</i>

40:28.120 --> 40:31.657
<i>across the city.</i>

40:31.690 --> 40:34.060
<i>Reports show that
by the end of the week</i>

40:34.093 --> 40:39.597
<i>the Immigration
Enforcement Agency</i>

40:39.632 --> 40:44.303
<i>will begin an operation
to deport another 2,000.</i>

40:44.336 --> 40:47.206
<i>It appears that law enforcement
has focused their proves</i>

40:47.239 --> 40:50.608
<i>primarily on Mexican
neighborhoods</i>

40:50.643 --> 40:55.014
<i>where large groups
of illegal immigrants</i>

40:55.047 --> 40:59.151
<i>are known to be residing.</i>

40:59.185 --> 41:01.787
Turn it off, Chef.

41:01.821 --> 41:04.790
I didn't turn it on.
It's been on all morning.

41:19.004 --> 41:20.239
What is it?

41:23.742 --> 41:25.845
I have good news.

41:25.878 --> 41:29.081
You don't
look like you have good news.

41:31.183 --> 41:34.253
What is it?

41:34.286 --> 41:36.822
I think we're
going to be able to stay here.

41:38.891 --> 41:42.428
We weren't ever
planning on leaving, were we?

41:42.461 --> 41:44.263
No, I mean...

41:47.099 --> 41:50.402
I mean we can stay forever.

41:50.436 --> 41:52.972
I can make enough money
to pay the fee

41:53.005 --> 41:55.241
for all three of you.

41:55.274 --> 41:56.275
How?

41:58.310 --> 42:01.080
I got a raise.

42:01.113 --> 42:03.816
You've only
been there two days, Chef.

42:03.849 --> 42:06.452
I know,
but I talked to Mr. Faust

42:06.485 --> 42:11.357
about what was going on
and he gave me a raise

42:11.390 --> 42:13.259
to help pay the fee.

42:14.927 --> 42:17.930
That's a big raise, Chef.

42:17.963 --> 42:19.365
And I don't appreciate you
telling other people

42:19.398 --> 42:21.300
about our struggles.

42:21.333 --> 42:22.701
It doesn't matter.

42:22.735 --> 42:24.103
That doesn't matter.

42:24.136 --> 42:26.172
I'm just saying that
we can stay.

42:26.205 --> 42:29.175
We don't have to worry anymore,

42:29.208 --> 42:31.143
because I'm going to provide
for our family.

42:31.177 --> 42:32.811
I don't know
what you're talking about.

42:32.845 --> 42:33.812
We're fine.

42:33.846 --> 42:34.980
Between your father and I
we can make enough.

42:35.014 --> 42:36.048
We'll be fine.

42:36.081 --> 42:39.985
You know that isn't true, Mama.

42:40.019 --> 42:44.023
We need $60,000.

42:44.056 --> 42:46.358
$60,000, Mama.

42:51.030 --> 42:53.332
Nothings going to happen.

42:53.365 --> 42:55.334
This is real.

42:55.367 --> 42:58.304
This is real, ok?

42:58.337 --> 42:59.972
I have to earn enough.

43:00.005 --> 43:01.907
They could come
and take you away tonight.

43:01.941 --> 43:04.977
You. Abuela. Dad.
Daniel. Lucia.

43:07.146 --> 43:09.081
Why can't you understand that?

43:13.953 --> 43:16.889
I'm not
going to let that happen.

43:19.425 --> 43:22.928
I have to run some errands
before work.

43:27.099 --> 43:28.734
I love you, son.

43:31.136 --> 43:32.471
I love you too, mama.

45:12.304 --> 45:15.040
Who's missing?

45:15.074 --> 45:18.310
We haven't seen Rodrigo
for a couple of days.

45:18.344 --> 45:19.478
That's right.

45:22.181 --> 45:23.582
This isn't a joke!

45:27.386 --> 45:29.555
But where is he today?

45:29.588 --> 45:31.090
Does anybody know?

45:36.929 --> 45:38.364
I talked to Rodrigo
a couple nights ago

45:38.397 --> 45:41.567
and he told me that...

45:41.600 --> 45:44.436
he told me that his family
might get deported.

45:44.470 --> 45:47.640
I don't know if he was,
but he could've been.

45:50.209 --> 45:52.044
He was deported.

45:54.714 --> 45:57.916
I received a text message
from him just yesterday,

45:57.950 --> 46:00.653
informing me that
he can no longer work here.

46:04.490 --> 46:05.991
We are a family.

46:07.426 --> 46:10.095
I need you to know that.

46:10.129 --> 46:12.197
I know this might not apply
to all of you,

46:12.231 --> 46:15.567
but if any of you
are threatened or at risk

46:15.601 --> 46:20.472
by any of these recent changes,
I need to know.

46:20.506 --> 46:23.041
I can help.

46:23.075 --> 46:25.277
We look out for each other.

46:25.310 --> 46:27.212
We support each other.

46:28.981 --> 46:31.984
And we will miss Rodrigo.

46:32.017 --> 46:34.721
Now, I'm sorry if this puts
a damper on your mood

46:34.754 --> 46:36.021
for tonight.

46:36.054 --> 46:37.623
But the restaurant
is fully booked.

46:37.657 --> 46:39.224
And you'll be busy.

46:39.258 --> 46:41.661
Hard work
is a great distraction.

46:41.694 --> 46:43.195
Let's get to it, right?

46:44.029 --> 46:45.364
Come on.

46:52.672 --> 46:54.540
I'm sorry, Chef.

48:13.619 --> 48:15.320
<i>...it's two and two.</i>

48:15.354 --> 48:17.322
<i>Reverse work out
of the first and third.</i>

48:17.356 --> 48:19.692
<i>Batting 245 this season.</i>

48:19.726 --> 48:21.527
<i>Now back to the Homeplate area.</i>

48:21.560 --> 48:22.795
<i>And there's breeze tonight.</i>

48:22.829 --> 48:26.398
<i>The outfielders responded
accordingly.</i>

48:26.431 --> 48:28.635
<i>Two-two pitch, and it's inside.</i>

48:28.668 --> 48:30.068
<i>And Reaper has to jump back.</i>

48:30.102 --> 48:31.069
<i>Look out.</i>

48:32.337 --> 48:34.239
<i>One out, bottom of the seventh,
a tie game.</i>

48:34.273 --> 48:35.642
<i>Lopez is on second.</i>

48:35.675 --> 48:37.276
<i>Taking in for Philippe.</i>

48:37.309 --> 48:38.711
<i>Here's the three-two.</i>

48:38.745 --> 48:39.979
Help, help!

48:40.013 --> 48:42.715
<i>Final
, Reaper stays behind.</i>

48:42.749 --> 48:44.483
<i>Giants been rallying back here,</i>

48:44.516 --> 48:46.151
<i>went down two nothing
in the second,</i>

48:46.184 --> 48:47.586
<i>three nothing in the fourth,</i>

48:47.619 --> 48:51.256
<i>the sixth was all good guys
trying to add on here.</i>

48:51.290 --> 48:53.158
<i>Reaper's back in the box.</i>

48:53.191 --> 48:54.359
<i>Here's the pitch.</i>

48:54.393 --> 48:55.527
<i>And Reaper's get...</i>

48:56.729 --> 48:58.363
Help!

48:58.397 --> 49:00.767
Hey!

49:00.800 --> 49:02.802
Please help!

49:02.835 --> 49:05.103
Please!

49:05.137 --> 49:07.172
Help!

49:07.205 --> 49:08.373
Help!

49:08.407 --> 49:10.409
Please, pull over!

49:10.442 --> 49:12.477
You don't have to do this.

49:12.511 --> 49:14.647
Let me go!

49:14.681 --> 49:16.448
Please!

49:16.481 --> 49:19.384
Help me!

49:19.418 --> 49:20.519
Please!

49:20.552 --> 49:22.120
Please!

50:54.446 --> 50:55.982
Hey, man,
do you have a bathroom?

50:56.015 --> 50:58.216
It's out of order.

51:40.927 --> 51:42.327
Excuse me.

51:44.296 --> 51:45.597
Excuse me.

51:45.631 --> 51:46.933
Yeah?

51:46.966 --> 51:49.635
Do you know him?

51:49.669 --> 51:51.804
Oh, that's Bill.

51:51.838 --> 51:53.673
Is he all right?

51:53.706 --> 51:54.372
He's harmless.

51:54.406 --> 51:57.442
He just likes pace around a lot.

51:57.476 --> 51:59.244
Okay, great.

52:07.452 --> 52:08.553
Yo, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

52:08.587 --> 52:09.856
It's $1.49.

52:14.392 --> 52:15.895
Sorry.

52:15.928 --> 52:17.764
It's one of those days.

52:20.099 --> 52:21.399
Sorry.

52:21.433 --> 52:22.969
Hey, do you want your change?

52:59.404 --> 53:00.605
We need to talk.

53:00.640 --> 53:02.507
Now.

53:28.567 --> 53:29.836
What happened?

53:29.869 --> 53:31.503
You know exactly what happened.

53:32.638 --> 53:34.372
I have no idea.

53:34.406 --> 53:35.675
What are you upset about?

53:37.442 --> 53:38.778
Did you drop the car off?

53:38.811 --> 53:42.048
Please don't do it.

53:42.081 --> 53:46.418
Chef, catch your breath.

53:46.451 --> 53:47.720
Tell me what happened.

53:51.924 --> 53:54.492
There was someone in the car.

53:54.526 --> 53:55.661
What you
mean, in the backseat?

53:55.695 --> 53:57.529
No, in the trunk.

53:58.865 --> 54:02.101
In the trunk.

54:02.134 --> 54:06.438
I could hear them screaming
and pounding.

54:09.675 --> 54:11.811
- Did you open it?
- No!

54:15.114 --> 54:17.016
Chef, you have to believe me

54:17.049 --> 54:18.885
when I say I know nothing
about this.

54:18.918 --> 54:20.753
Yeah, you keep saying that.

54:20.786 --> 54:21.553
But if you didn't know,

54:21.586 --> 54:23.588
then how come
Michael was there?

54:23.622 --> 54:25.057
And don't try to tell me
it was a coincidence

54:25.091 --> 54:28.995
because I saw his car
the other night too.

54:29.028 --> 54:30.129
As I've told you before,

54:30.162 --> 54:33.598
Michael is here to make sure
things get done properly.

54:33.633 --> 54:34.967
It's for your own safety.

54:36.102 --> 54:37.136
I'm done.

54:40.106 --> 54:42.574
Look at me.

54:42.607 --> 54:43.809
Look at me.

54:45.745 --> 54:46.611
You have to believe me

54:46.646 --> 54:49.682
when I say I did not know
what happened.

54:49.715 --> 54:51.117
I'll get to the bottom of it.

54:52.251 --> 54:54.020
Here.

54:54.053 --> 54:55.922
I want you to take this.

54:55.955 --> 54:57.522
$10,000.

54:59.859 --> 55:01.593
Please.

55:01.626 --> 55:03.062
Save it for your family.

55:16.976 --> 55:20.079
You lied to me, Faust.

55:20.112 --> 55:23.015
You said this wasn't going
to be illegal,

55:23.049 --> 55:26.752
and now, I'm moving dead...

55:26.786 --> 55:29.722
I'm moving living bodies.

55:29.755 --> 55:31.556
It seems to me that
I'm the only one providing you

55:31.589 --> 55:35.593
with a means to keep
your family together.

55:35.627 --> 55:39.065
And you are accepting the money.

55:39.098 --> 55:42.567
Let's not forget that.

55:42.600 --> 55:46.038
Listen, Chef, I truly am sorry.

55:46.072 --> 55:49.275
Let me make it up to you.

55:49.308 --> 55:51.543
I don't want you to make it up
to me.

55:54.113 --> 55:56.581
I'm not interested.

55:56.614 --> 55:57.917
I'm going home.

56:02.554 --> 56:04.690
50,000, Chef.

56:10.062 --> 56:12.898
50,000.

56:12.932 --> 56:14.133
It's yours.

56:15.835 --> 56:18.704
And if I'm done
my calculations correctly,

56:18.738 --> 56:21.573
that covers your family's fees.

56:21.606 --> 56:24.043
And leaves a healthy sum
for you on the side.

56:27.279 --> 56:29.115
Same game.

56:29.148 --> 56:31.150
Same rules.

56:31.183 --> 56:32.985
And I'll give you the money.

56:33.019 --> 56:34.787
Just give it to me.

56:34.820 --> 56:36.255
You owe me that.

56:36.288 --> 56:38.791
I really would, Chef.

56:38.824 --> 56:39.992
But you know that
I don't get paid

56:40.026 --> 56:42.328
until the car's delivered.

56:42.361 --> 56:44.697
Why is this one worth so much?

56:44.730 --> 56:46.732
What's in the car?

56:46.766 --> 56:48.034
Just a bag.

56:50.636 --> 56:52.071
I don't believe you.

56:55.374 --> 56:58.144
Do this for me,
and you'll never have to see me again.

57:00.279 --> 57:02.715
One more time.

57:02.748 --> 57:04.817
And you and your family
are free.

57:08.254 --> 57:09.855
I don't know.

57:11.957 --> 57:13.726
Go home.

57:13.759 --> 57:14.960
Sleep on it.

57:22.068 --> 57:24.236
Can I know what's in the bag?

57:26.806 --> 57:29.008
Meet me tomorrow.

57:29.041 --> 57:30.109
I'll give you
all the information

57:30.142 --> 57:31.677
that you need.

57:33.412 --> 57:35.915
No secrets.

57:35.948 --> 57:37.316
I'll think about it.

58:28.067 --> 58:29.668
Okay.

58:29.702 --> 58:30.803
Last thing.

58:32.738 --> 58:34.707
For those of you
who haven't met him,

58:34.740 --> 58:36.208
this is Gary.

58:36.242 --> 58:40.112
Gary's our new cook,
a sushi chef, to be precise.

58:40.146 --> 58:41.213
He'll make
a valuable contribution

58:41.247 --> 58:42.681
to our team.

58:42.715 --> 58:45.117
I want you to give him all
a warm welcome.

58:45.151 --> 58:46.852
All right, let's get cooking.

58:54.927 --> 58:56.328
No.

58:56.362 --> 58:58.731
This is different.

58:58.764 --> 59:01.300
Timing is everything here.

59:01.333 --> 59:05.371
You'll have exactly 45 minutes
from start to finish.

59:05.404 --> 59:09.308
One minute either side of that,
I cannot guarantee your safety.

59:09.341 --> 59:10.976
Do you understand?

59:11.010 --> 59:12.378
Yes.

59:12.411 --> 59:14.346
Once you've
dropped off the car,

59:14.380 --> 59:17.783
get out of there
as quickly as possible.

59:17.816 --> 59:18.784
Don't come into work tomorrow.

59:18.817 --> 59:21.153
Lie low.

59:21.187 --> 59:23.122
Should I worry about cameras?

59:23.155 --> 59:24.323
Cameras?

59:24.356 --> 59:26.759
I don't know.
Like street cameras?

59:26.792 --> 59:28.928
No, no,
don't worry about that stuff.

59:28.961 --> 59:31.330
Should I wear a mask or...
or something?

59:31.363 --> 59:34.800
Just wear what you usually wear.

59:34.833 --> 59:37.036
Okay?

59:37.069 --> 59:38.003
Okay.

59:39.471 --> 59:41.273
Listen, you'll be fine.

59:41.307 --> 59:43.175
Just remember the rule.

59:43.209 --> 59:45.511
Don't open the trunk.

59:45.544 --> 59:46.845
Right.

59:49.114 --> 59:50.182
Last question.

59:53.519 --> 59:56.488
What should I do
if something goes wrong?

59:59.792 --> 01:00:01.927
20 years ago,
I opened up my first restaurant

01:00:01.961 --> 01:00:03.162
with a partner.

01:00:05.064 --> 01:00:09.435
He was much more experienced
than I was, a real bulldog.

01:00:11.003 --> 01:00:12.805
We opened to much fanfare.

01:00:12.838 --> 01:00:14.807
Everybody loved our food.

01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:17.209
Except for one man.

01:00:17.243 --> 01:00:20.212
Unfortunately, for us,
that man happened to be

01:00:20.246 --> 01:00:24.516
the most respected food critic
in all the country.

01:00:24.550 --> 01:00:28.120
We couldn't understand
why he hated our food.

01:00:28.153 --> 01:00:30.289
He pitted us against
a local rival,

01:00:30.322 --> 01:00:32.558
and chose them as the winner.

01:00:32.591 --> 01:00:36.028
Well, my partner wouldn't have
any of it.

01:00:36.061 --> 01:00:37.997
He held private tastings
for the critic,

01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:40.833
shared recipes with the critic.

01:00:40.866 --> 01:00:44.136
Nothing changed his mind.

01:00:44.169 --> 01:00:47.406
Well, one day,
my partner had enough.

01:00:49.541 --> 01:00:52.111
He paid a young chef
from the other restaurant

01:00:52.144 --> 01:00:55.047
to put rotten meat into several
of their dishes that night.

01:00:56.982 --> 01:00:59.285
Dozens of people
got food poisoning.

01:00:59.318 --> 01:01:01.353
A couple so bad,
they were hospitalized.

01:01:03.022 --> 01:01:04.323
One died.

01:01:07.259 --> 01:01:09.928
Following that,
the restaurant closed.

01:01:12.031 --> 01:01:13.332
Guess what?

01:01:15.567 --> 01:01:17.903
The food critic finally gave us
the glowing review

01:01:17.936 --> 01:01:19.371
we've been waiting for.

01:01:22.975 --> 01:01:24.977
I'm not sure I'm understanding,
Faust.

01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:30.049
What does that have to do
with my question?

01:01:30.082 --> 01:01:32.251
When something goes wrong,

01:01:32.284 --> 01:01:35.387
you do whatever it takes
to make it right.

01:01:38.290 --> 01:01:40.192
You can never go too far.

01:02:04.516 --> 01:02:07.052
Hey, man, is that your car?

01:02:07.086 --> 01:02:09.021
Uh, yeah, why?

01:03:11.450 --> 01:03:14.086
<i>New details
tonight as police continue to search</i>

01:03:14.119 --> 01:03:16.088
<i>for the culprits
of the bank robbery</i>

01:03:16.121 --> 01:03:19.324
<i>on West 23rd and 2nd Street
this afternoon.</i>

01:03:19.358 --> 01:03:21.093
<i>By the time police responded,</i>

01:03:21.126 --> 01:03:24.096
<i>the suspects had already
fled the scene.</i>

01:03:24.129 --> 01:03:27.099
<i>A breaking eyewitness account
informed local enforcement</i>

01:03:27.132 --> 01:03:30.703
<i>that the getaway car was likely
a white Toyota Camry.</i>

01:03:30.737 --> 01:03:32.037
<i>It is believed
that the culprits</i>

01:03:32.070 --> 01:03:34.473
<i>may still be within city limits.</i>

01:03:34.506 --> 01:03:36.108
<i>Officers
are encouraging citizens</i>

01:03:36.141 --> 01:03:39.178
<i>to report any additional
information they might have.</i>

01:03:39.211 --> 01:03:40.179
<i>Chief Commissioner Ru...</i>

01:04:59.859 --> 01:05:01.326
No, no, no, no!

01:05:36.628 --> 01:05:37.864
- I'm so sorry.
- Get your hands up!

01:05:37.897 --> 01:05:38.998
- I'm so sorry.
- Keep your hands up!

01:05:39.032 --> 01:05:39.966
- I don't know what's in there.
- Put your hands up!

01:05:39.999 --> 01:05:40.800
- I don't know anything.
- And keep them up!

01:05:40.833 --> 01:05:41.734
Hey, I don't know anything,
okay?

01:05:41.768 --> 01:05:43.770
Get your hands up now!
Put your hands up!

01:05:43.803 --> 01:05:45.404
- Okay, wait.
- Get your hands up!

01:05:45.437 --> 01:05:47.139
- Ah, okay.
- Stop moving.

01:05:47.172 --> 01:05:49.141
- Okay.
- Listen to me.

01:05:49.174 --> 01:05:50.375
When I tell you,
I want you to put your hands

01:05:50.409 --> 01:05:52.144
behind your head,
interlace your fingers,

01:05:52.177 --> 01:05:53.312
- you understand?
- Yeah.

01:05:53.345 --> 01:05:54.346
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

01:05:54.379 --> 01:05:55.380
Do it!
Start doing it now!

01:05:55.414 --> 01:05:56.248
Okay.

01:05:58.250 --> 01:05:58.851
Do it!

01:06:00.753 --> 01:06:01.420
Wait.

01:06:01.453 --> 01:06:02.521
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:06:21.273 --> 01:06:23.375
What are you doing?

01:06:23.408 --> 01:06:24.543
- Why'd you do that?
- Shut up!

01:06:24.576 --> 01:06:25.745
Why'd you kill him?

01:06:27.312 --> 01:06:29.314
- Why?
- Get in the car.

01:06:45.898 --> 01:06:48.600
- Get in the car!
- Okay, okay.

01:07:04.851 --> 01:07:06.451
Drive.

01:07:33.913 --> 01:07:35.514
Take this exit.

01:07:40.419 --> 01:07:42.454
The drop off
was the opposite way.

01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:49.796
We're almost there.

01:07:55.034 --> 01:07:56.568
Where we going?

01:07:59.005 --> 01:08:01.273
Do you know
what's in your trunk?

01:08:01.306 --> 01:08:02.441
Yes.

01:08:03.575 --> 01:08:06.913
Do you know
how much of it's in there?

01:08:06.946 --> 01:08:08.413
No.

01:08:12.051 --> 01:08:14.286
Somewhere around three million.

01:08:57.697 --> 01:08:58.997
Get out.

01:09:03.468 --> 01:09:04.837
Get out!

01:09:12.879 --> 01:09:14.814
You, come here!

01:09:32.098 --> 01:09:34.100
You wouldn't.

01:09:34.133 --> 01:09:36.102
I would.

01:09:36.135 --> 01:09:38.403
Listen.

01:09:38.435 --> 01:09:40.505
All I want is the money.

01:09:40.538 --> 01:09:42.073
I can't let you take it.

01:09:44.542 --> 01:09:46.377
Now, back up.

01:09:46.411 --> 01:09:47.680
Back up!

01:09:57.056 --> 01:09:59.558
Don't be a hero.

01:09:59.591 --> 01:10:03.129
You don't even know
who he really is.

01:10:03.162 --> 01:10:05.731
What are you talking about?

01:10:05.765 --> 01:10:08.466
Listen, you either shoot me
or I'm taking the money.

01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:09.035
We both know
you're not gonna shoot me.

01:10:09.068 --> 01:10:09.969
Don't move.

01:10:13.538 --> 01:10:15.440
Don't move!

01:10:22.949 --> 01:10:26.085
You think you're ever
gonna be done driving, Chef?

01:10:26.118 --> 01:10:29.588
There's guys that have been
doing this for years.

01:10:29.621 --> 01:10:32.524
There's only one way this ends.

01:10:32.557 --> 01:10:35.127
With Faust dead.

01:10:35.161 --> 01:10:37.997
Then why are you doing this,
huh?

01:10:38.030 --> 01:10:41.466
What are you gonna do
with the money?

01:10:41.499 --> 01:10:43.636
Faust never lets anyone out
clean.

01:10:43.669 --> 01:10:46.005
This is my chance,
and I'm taking it.

01:10:46.038 --> 01:10:48.040
You should too.

01:10:52.044 --> 01:10:55.081
You take the money,
and then what?

01:10:55.114 --> 01:10:56.481
Tell me!

01:10:58.651 --> 01:11:02.054
Like I said, only one way out.

01:11:04.023 --> 01:11:05.624
I can't kill him.

01:11:09.996 --> 01:11:13.065
I'll turn myself in.

01:11:13.099 --> 01:11:15.067
Then what?

01:11:15.101 --> 01:11:15.902
He'll come after your family,

01:11:15.935 --> 01:11:18.536
and you won't be able
to stop him.

01:11:22.174 --> 01:11:23.809
Then what do I do?

01:11:23.843 --> 01:11:25.577
Huh?

01:11:25.610 --> 01:11:27.612
I don't know.
Shoot him.

01:11:27.647 --> 01:11:29.048
I can't shoot him.

01:11:31.050 --> 01:11:33.920
I've never even really held
a gun before.

01:11:33.953 --> 01:11:36.055
You seem pretty comfortable
with a knife.

01:11:41.493 --> 01:11:42.762
It's your family, man.

01:11:45.197 --> 01:11:46.999
We got a deal?

01:11:58.711 --> 01:12:01.681
...now that we go back today,
uh, dogs in.

01:12:04.050 --> 01:12:05.617
Faust!

01:12:16.996 --> 01:12:18.530
- We need to talk.
- What's going on?

01:12:18.563 --> 01:12:20.766
We need to talk.

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:21.667
Excuse me, everyone.

01:12:21.701 --> 01:12:23.769
This is one of my chefs.

01:12:25.972 --> 01:12:27.940
You're embarrassing yourself.

01:12:27.974 --> 01:12:29.175
Go to bathroom now.

01:12:29.208 --> 01:12:30.608
I'll see you in there.

01:12:30.643 --> 01:12:31.711
Go.

01:12:33.813 --> 01:12:35.181
Excuse me, everyone.

01:12:35.214 --> 01:12:38.017
There seems to be
a minor incident in the kitchen.

01:12:38.050 --> 01:12:41.519
Rest assured, your meals
will be fully comped tonight.

01:12:41.553 --> 01:12:43.222
I apologize
for the interruption.

01:13:01.674 --> 01:13:03.508
What happened?

01:13:07.246 --> 01:13:09.648
It didn't work.

01:13:09.682 --> 01:13:11.616
What do you mean,
it didn't work?

01:13:11.650 --> 01:13:12.852
Someone called the cops.

01:13:12.885 --> 01:13:14.619
I was being tailed.

01:13:14.653 --> 01:13:17.123
The money is gone.

01:13:17.156 --> 01:13:18.556
What?

01:13:22.128 --> 01:13:22.995
Faust, really, I...

01:13:23.029 --> 01:13:26.298
Do you know how many wetbacks
I employ?

01:13:26.332 --> 01:13:28.300
Dozens.

01:13:28.334 --> 01:13:33.339
Each of them as desperate
as you,

01:13:33.372 --> 01:13:37.910
begging me to save them,
to save their families,

01:13:37.943 --> 01:13:40.246
humping my leg like dogs.

01:13:42.248 --> 01:13:45.684
So they do as I tell them.

01:13:45.718 --> 01:13:49.822
Or else I make one call,
and they wake up in the hole

01:13:49.855 --> 01:13:51.290
that they crawled out from.

01:13:57.963 --> 01:14:00.366
But you're a little different.

01:14:00.399 --> 01:14:03.002
Do you know why?

01:14:03.035 --> 01:14:05.704
No.

01:14:05.738 --> 01:14:09.108
Because of a piece of paper
with your name on it.

01:14:10.643 --> 01:14:12.978
You're an American.

01:14:13.012 --> 01:14:16.215
And if you were suddenly
to go missing,

01:14:16.248 --> 01:14:18.117
people would care about that.

01:14:20.953 --> 01:14:25.057
But no one cares about
your friends, like Rodrigo.

01:14:27.259 --> 01:14:29.261
Rodrigo failed me.

01:14:29.295 --> 01:14:31.030
He crossed a line.

01:14:32.798 --> 01:14:34.767
You deported him.

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:37.736
Ah, no.

01:14:39.972 --> 01:14:41.307
I killed him.

01:14:46.679 --> 01:14:48.147
Actually, you killed him.

01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:49.281
What?

01:14:49.315 --> 01:14:50.850
You heard him in the trunk
of your car

01:14:50.883 --> 01:14:53.185
and did nothing about it
like a coward.

01:14:58.023 --> 01:15:00.793
I thought for a moment
that you knew everything.

01:15:00.826 --> 01:15:02.828
No.

01:15:02.862 --> 01:15:05.064
But you're too
stupid to know anything.

01:15:07.233 --> 01:15:12.071
From the moment
you first set foot in that car,

01:15:12.104 --> 01:15:15.875
I own you.

01:15:15.908 --> 01:15:17.810
It was a nice car, wasn't it?

01:15:18.844 --> 01:15:20.713
Wasn't it?!

01:15:22.114 --> 01:15:23.816
It was also a stolen car.

01:15:24.984 --> 01:15:26.785
And now I have it.

01:15:26.819 --> 01:15:29.321
It has your fingerprints
all over it.

01:15:32.791 --> 01:15:35.094
You're mine.

01:15:35.127 --> 01:15:36.862
I could bury you.

01:15:39.064 --> 01:15:41.133
So, you will work for me.

01:15:41.167 --> 01:15:42.468
Or you'll go to jail

01:15:42.501 --> 01:15:44.703
and your family will go back
to Mexico,

01:15:44.737 --> 01:15:45.905
if they are lucky.

01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:52.244
You cost me a lot of money
tonight.

01:15:52.278 --> 01:15:55.214
But you'll repay me.

01:15:55.247 --> 01:15:57.116
Oh, yes,
you'll make it up to me.

01:15:59.351 --> 01:16:01.921
You will drive for me
every night

01:16:01.954 --> 01:16:03.923
until you've repaid the debt.

01:16:05.457 --> 01:16:06.959
Got it?

01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:10.930
Yeah.

01:16:10.963 --> 01:16:12.364
Got it?

01:16:16.402 --> 01:16:18.904
Good.

01:16:18.938 --> 01:16:21.407
Now, where's the car?

01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:23.342
I was...

01:16:23.375 --> 01:16:30.249
I was trying to tell you
that Michael ran off with it.

01:16:30.282 --> 01:16:31.984
He shot a cop.

01:16:45.030 --> 01:16:46.832
He's probably half way
to Mexico now.

01:16:51.237 --> 01:16:53.072
I'll take care of him.

01:16:56.141 --> 01:16:58.911
I need you here tomorrow
at 7:30 AM, got it?

01:17:02.214 --> 01:17:04.116
Now, get up!

01:17:13.359 --> 01:17:14.860
Oh, and Chef...

01:17:18.063 --> 01:17:20.165
This should cover
the rest of the fee.

01:17:25.237 --> 01:17:27.973
Because we're family, right?

01:18:36.942 --> 01:18:40.179
Hey, you're Chef, right?

01:18:40.212 --> 01:18:42.981
Uh, yeah.

01:18:43.015 --> 01:18:45.284
Um, Gary?

01:18:45.317 --> 01:18:46.585
Yeah, hey.

01:18:46.618 --> 01:18:47.886
Heard a lot about you.

01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:49.888
I just wanted to let you know
if there's anything I can do,

01:18:49.922 --> 01:18:51.290
I'm here to help.

01:18:51.323 --> 01:18:55.160
Yeah, uh, I heard
you have some talent with fish.

01:18:55.194 --> 01:18:56.528
I guess so.

01:18:59.498 --> 01:19:01.266
Yeah, we have a few fish items.

01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:04.570
So, hopefully, we could put you
to use tonight.

01:19:04.603 --> 01:19:05.571
Cool, yeah.

01:19:05.604 --> 01:19:07.473
Hey, um, that's actually not
the real reason

01:19:07.506 --> 01:19:08.675
why I wanted to speak to you.

01:19:08.708 --> 01:19:10.909
I was wondering,
who's in charge of orders

01:19:10.943 --> 01:19:13.011
around here?

01:19:13.045 --> 01:19:13.979
I am.

01:19:14.012 --> 01:19:15.914
Um, Carlos processes it though.

01:19:15.948 --> 01:19:17.116
Why?

01:19:17.149 --> 01:19:19.451
Oh, well, I have to do
a custom sushi order

01:19:19.485 --> 01:19:22.154
for Faust and his guest
tomorrow night.

01:19:22.187 --> 01:19:25.658
And, uh,
I just had a couple requests.

01:19:25.692 --> 01:19:26.592
Sure.

01:19:26.625 --> 01:19:27.626
Yeah.

01:19:28.728 --> 01:19:29.796
All right.

01:19:29.829 --> 01:19:35.367
Um, I need albacore,
puffer fish, and eel, please.

01:19:36.568 --> 01:19:38.537
- Puffer fish?
- Yeah.

01:19:38.570 --> 01:19:40.372
And, uh, everything else
we have in stock.

01:19:40.406 --> 01:19:42.307
So we should be okay.

01:19:42.341 --> 01:19:43.442
Are you licensed to serve it?

01:19:43.475 --> 01:19:46.713
I heard
it's extremely poisonous.

01:19:46.746 --> 01:19:47.546
Yeah, yeah, if...

01:19:47.579 --> 01:19:49.682
if you serve the wrong part,
it is.

01:19:49.716 --> 01:19:51.651
But, uh, I am licensed.

01:19:51.684 --> 01:19:54.286
And I'm gonna go ahead
and prepare it myself.

01:19:54.319 --> 01:19:57.055
- So, we'll be okay.
- Okay.

01:19:57.089 --> 01:19:59.625
Yeah, um, I'll put in an order
for all that.

01:19:59.659 --> 01:20:00.959
Thanks, Chef.

01:20:00.993 --> 01:20:02.561
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:20:02.594 --> 01:20:05.130
Hey, what's up with the name,
man?

01:20:05.164 --> 01:20:08.100
Um, uh...

01:20:08.133 --> 01:20:10.202
So, when I was born,
my mom said she's...

01:20:10.235 --> 01:20:11.603
Hey, Chef.

01:20:11.638 --> 01:20:14.339
Faust wants to see you
in the restaurant.

01:20:14.373 --> 01:20:15.407
Now?

01:20:15.441 --> 01:20:16.975
I guess.

01:20:18.711 --> 01:20:21.380
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

01:20:37.730 --> 01:20:39.164
We're closed for Sunday?.

01:20:39.198 --> 01:20:41.333
What's up, Chef?

01:20:41.366 --> 01:20:42.568
Surprise.

01:20:42.601 --> 01:20:44.002
Chef.

01:20:46.639 --> 01:20:48.775
What are you guys doing here?

01:20:48.808 --> 01:20:50.476
Don't worry.

01:20:50.509 --> 01:20:52.712
Please, come and join us
for a moment.

01:20:55.748 --> 01:20:57.082
I'm sorry.

01:20:57.115 --> 01:20:58.550
I interrupted your story.

01:20:58.584 --> 01:20:59.686
That's right.

01:20:59.719 --> 01:21:02.254
Abuela, here,
is so proud of Chef.

01:21:02.287 --> 01:21:04.590
She mounted his name
in our kitchen.

01:21:04.623 --> 01:21:06.024
Really?

01:21:06.058 --> 01:21:07.760
Well, you've taught him well,
senora.

01:21:07.794 --> 01:21:10.162
He's doing a fine job
in this kitchen.

01:21:10.195 --> 01:21:12.598
I owe so much to him.

01:21:12.632 --> 01:21:16.535
In fact, I'm rather indebted
to your family.

01:21:18.403 --> 01:21:19.739
I have an idea.

01:21:23.175 --> 01:21:25.110
How would you like it
if Daniel

01:21:25.143 --> 01:21:26.445
came and worked a few nights
with me?

01:21:26.478 --> 01:21:27.513
- Yeah.
- No.

01:21:29.381 --> 01:21:33.452
I just don't think
that's a good idea, Willem.

01:21:33.485 --> 01:21:35.554
Daniel has school.

01:21:37.857 --> 01:21:42.227
Mama,
I don't think it's a good idea.

01:21:42.261 --> 01:21:43.061
It's hard work and sometimes

01:21:43.095 --> 01:21:46.465
we have to work really
late nights.

01:21:46.498 --> 01:21:48.100
Oh, come on, Chef.

01:21:49.601 --> 01:21:51.638
It's a great idea.

01:21:55.842 --> 01:21:58.745
It'd be so much fun.

01:21:58.778 --> 01:22:02.381
You and Daniel both working
in the same kitchen together.

01:22:02.414 --> 01:22:05.417
Plus, it would only be
a few nights of the week.

01:22:05.450 --> 01:22:08.287
I promise to pay him handsomely.

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:09.288
Come on, Mama.

01:22:09.321 --> 01:22:12.257
You're always telling me
I need to work harder.

01:22:12.291 --> 01:22:13.091
I guess we could make it work.

01:22:13.125 --> 01:22:14.426
You two could ride to work
together.

01:22:14.459 --> 01:22:16.128
I just...

01:22:16.161 --> 01:22:19.732
I just don't think
it's a good idea.

01:22:28.307 --> 01:22:31.610
Yeah, sounds great.

01:22:31.644 --> 01:22:33.312
Wonderful.

01:22:33.345 --> 01:22:35.614
Um, I just wanted
to let you know

01:22:35.648 --> 01:22:38.317
that my kids will always be
indebted to you.

01:22:38.350 --> 01:22:39.719
Oh, I know they are.

01:22:41.788 --> 01:22:46.325
Daniel, why don't you come
and see me early next week?

01:22:46.358 --> 01:22:48.126
I have a job waiting for you.

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:49.127
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

01:22:49.161 --> 01:22:50.195
Thank you very much.

01:22:50.228 --> 01:22:51.163
Great.

01:22:51.196 --> 01:22:52.632
Well, that settles it then.

01:22:54.232 --> 01:22:58.738
Chef, it's time that you prepare
the food for your family.

01:22:58.771 --> 01:23:00.640
Show them your hand at work.

01:23:02.875 --> 01:23:04.711
Of course.

01:23:10.549 --> 01:23:13.585
Please, tell
me, your husband can...

01:24:27.559 --> 01:24:30.830
Quiet down, love.
I'm trying to watch TV.

01:24:30.863 --> 01:24:31.864
Sorry, Abuela.

01:24:43.508 --> 01:24:45.343
I'm going to head to work, ok?

01:24:45.377 --> 01:24:46.779
Ok, grandson.

01:24:48.047 --> 01:24:49.916
I love you, Abuela.

01:24:49.949 --> 01:24:51.718
I love you too.

01:25:06.666 --> 01:25:08.400
Lulu, you here?

01:25:12.905 --> 01:25:14.539
Lulu?

01:25:15.975 --> 01:25:17.810
Lulu?

01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:42.567
I love you, Abuela.

01:25:42.601 --> 01:25:43.669
Love you too.

01:25:43.703 --> 01:25:44.436
Tell
everyone else I love them too.

01:25:44.469 --> 01:25:46.338
I will.

01:25:46.371 --> 01:25:47.874
Be safe, ok?

01:25:47.907 --> 01:25:48.875
'Kay.

01:26:59.645 --> 01:27:01.681
All right, everybody, gather up.

01:27:01.714 --> 01:27:03.515
I'd like to introduce
a new member of the family

01:27:03.548 --> 01:27:04.050
tonight.

01:27:04.083 --> 01:27:06.118
Her name is Gloria.

01:27:06.152 --> 01:27:08.154
Chef over here is the master
of the house.

01:27:08.187 --> 01:27:10.455
So direct any questions
you have to him.

01:27:12.457 --> 01:27:15.795
Don't you want to ask him
how he got his name?

01:27:15.828 --> 01:27:17.096
All right, everybody,
have a good night.

01:27:18.764 --> 01:27:19.899
Faust.

01:27:22.668 --> 01:27:23.970
Yes, Chef?

01:27:25.972 --> 01:27:28.174
I just wanted to
talk to you in private

01:27:28.207 --> 01:27:31.043
after we close up tonight.

01:27:31.077 --> 01:27:31.878
Okay.

01:27:31.911 --> 01:27:33.946
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah.

01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:36.581
I just wanted to thank you,
uh, after last night

01:27:36.615 --> 01:27:39.517
for giving my brother a job

01:27:39.551 --> 01:27:40.820
'cause I was a little nervous
at the beginning.

01:27:40.853 --> 01:27:43.723
But I think
it would be good for him.

01:27:46.959 --> 01:27:48.593
Okay.

01:27:48.627 --> 01:27:50.462
And he had so many questions
he wanted to ask you,

01:27:50.495 --> 01:27:52.464
so I promised him I would.

01:27:52.497 --> 01:27:54.100
Absolutely.

01:27:54.133 --> 01:27:56.168
Anything for your family.

01:27:56.202 --> 01:27:58.070
Thank you, Willem.

01:27:58.104 --> 01:27:59.105
I'll come and get you
after work.

01:27:59.138 --> 01:28:00.106
Don't worry.

01:28:00.139 --> 01:28:01.573
I'll come find you.

01:28:03.475 --> 01:28:04.710
Sure.

01:28:14.552 --> 01:28:17.690
So, when you dine at my table,
you get the king's treatment.

01:28:17.723 --> 01:28:19.225
Tonight, we have an array
of fine food

01:28:19.258 --> 01:28:21.626
from my new chef, Chef Gary.

01:28:21.661 --> 01:28:22.762
He's our sushi master.

01:28:22.795 --> 01:28:28.000
And, uh, he's prepared us
a five-course sushi platter.

01:28:33.139 --> 01:28:35.207
Are you on Faust's table
tonight?

01:28:35.241 --> 01:28:37.542
Yeah, 10 quarters of the sushi.

01:28:37.575 --> 01:28:39.178
Each person with
their own special arrangement.

01:28:39.211 --> 01:28:43.615
This, his food.

01:28:43.649 --> 01:28:44.984
Puffer fish?

01:28:45.017 --> 01:28:47.153
Sounds great.
Keep going.

01:28:47.186 --> 01:28:48.821
Hey, Chef.

01:28:48.854 --> 01:28:50.790
Can I ask you a question?

01:28:50.823 --> 01:28:53.059
Yeah.

01:28:53.092 --> 01:28:54.961
You remember Rodrigo?

01:28:59.098 --> 01:29:01.067
Of course.

01:29:01.100 --> 01:29:02.835
Now, I'm just curious.

01:29:02.868 --> 01:29:04.469
What happened to him?

01:29:08.641 --> 01:29:11.711
He got depo...

01:29:11.744 --> 01:29:14.512
Wait.

01:29:14.546 --> 01:29:17.116
Would you
do anything for your family?

01:29:18.317 --> 01:29:20.052
Order up!

01:29:22.288 --> 01:29:24.556
This is going to Faust.

01:29:33.666 --> 01:29:36.102
You're his cousin.

01:29:36.135 --> 01:29:38.603
So would I.

01:30:10.102 --> 01:30:12.304
SERVER;
<i>Bon apetit.</i>

01:30:12.338 --> 01:30:14.240
This is the food
that I was telling you about.

01:30:14.273 --> 01:30:15.708
Sushi chef, yeah.

01:30:18.911 --> 01:30:20.046
Ooh.

01:30:22.014 --> 01:30:24.350
I mean, I've heard that chefs
make or break a restaurant.

01:30:24.383 --> 01:30:26.886
Mmm, yes,
you're absolutely right.

01:30:26.919 --> 01:30:29.855
I found the key to run
a successful restaurant

01:30:29.889 --> 01:30:33.059
is not giving into
a man's desires,

01:30:33.092 --> 01:30:39.065
but more of satisfying
his instincts and needs.

01:30:40.900 --> 01:30:43.202
'Cause if you do this,
you'll have him coming back

01:30:43.235 --> 01:30:45.603
for years to come.

01:30:45.638 --> 01:30:46.839
Mmm.

01:30:48.407 --> 01:30:49.842
Excuse me.

01:30:53.312 --> 01:30:55.748
It's probably
pretty hard to find...

01:30:56.882 --> 01:30:58.851
Yeah, so, at above all else,
the most important...

01:31:01.387 --> 01:31:03.789
Component is your employees.

01:32:06.785 --> 01:32:09.255
So, it's Chef, right?

01:32:09.288 --> 01:32:10.923
What's the story of your name?

01:32:20.910 --> 01:32:25.910
