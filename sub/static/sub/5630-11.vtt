isn't what it used to be,

my covers were up enough
that they didn't see me,

22:55.775 --> 23:00.478
so I pretended to be asleep and
eventually I passed out again.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.546
I didn't wake up
until this morning.

23:03.915 --> 23:05.549
- Were you awake when they--

23:05.551 --> 23:07.952
- No, thank God.

23:07.954 --> 23:11.422
But when I woke up,
there was this...pain.

23:13.859 --> 23:17.928
I knew what they did to me.

23:17.930 --> 23:19.463
Thought I picked
a safe neighborhood.

23:19.465 --> 23:22.133
I just came to look
at grad schools.

23:22.135 --> 23:24.502
- You, uh...

23:24.504 --> 23:26.804
you sure it was 11:30
when you saw them?

23:26.806 --> 23:29.740
- Mm-hmm, I remember because
the clock on my bedside table

23:29.742 --> 23:33.577
was so bright
when I first opened my eyes.

23:33.579 --> 23:36.714
- And you got a good look
at their faces?

23:36.716 --> 23:39.884
- Hard as I try,
I'll never forget them.

23:40.919 --> 23:42.553
- Can you tell me

23:42.555 --> 23:44.622
if this is
one of the men you saw?

23:46.825 --> 23:48.993
- No.

23:51.563 --> 23:54.198
I'm sorry, he's definitely
not one of them.

23:59.004 --> 24:00.671
- I want badge numbers
from all of you.

24:00.673 --> 24:02.807
You're lucky if I don't sue
every one of your asses

24:02.809 --> 24:04.542
for false accusation.

24:04.544 --> 24:05.810
- Yeah, not sure
if that's a crime,

24:05.812 --> 24:06.911
but we'll be sure to lawyer up.

24:06.913 --> 24:08.746
- We got two home invasions

24:08.748 --> 24:10.714
and two rapes in Chicago
alone,

24:10.716 --> 24:13.517
and we just kicked
our only suspect.

24:13.519 --> 24:14.919
- Based on Tawny's description,

24:14.921 --> 24:16.554
we're looking
for two Latino males

24:16.556 --> 24:17.855
and a white guy with a beard.

24:17.857 --> 24:19.056
- I cross-referenced
the description

24:19.058 --> 24:20.224
of everybody
who worked on the condo,

24:20.226 --> 24:21.926
so I should have a name soon.

24:21.928 --> 24:24.028
- We're still waiting on the
results from Tawny's rape kit,

24:24.030 --> 24:26.464
but her blood test did come back
positive for nitrous oxide.

24:26.466 --> 24:27.932
- You know what I don't get?

24:27.934 --> 24:30.935
Tawny was a post-grad
staying at an Airbnb.

24:30.937 --> 24:33.537
She didn't have anything
valuable, you know,

24:33.539 --> 24:34.839
so why target her?

24:34.841 --> 24:37.908
- Hey, guys.
So I'm going through pod footage

24:37.910 --> 24:40.044
of the Cliffords' neighborhood
leading up to the robbery.

24:40.046 --> 24:43.814
not until I had a second
incident to compare it to.

24:43.816 --> 24:47.518
There's a 2003 black Suburban
parked outside of both condos

24:47.520 --> 24:49.954
the day before the robbery.

24:49.956 --> 24:54.658
Ran the plates, came back with
one Ty Henley out of Des Moines.

24:54.660 --> 24:56.861
Five years ago
he was a person of interest

24:56.863 --> 24:59.196

out of Wisconsin.

24:59.198 --> 25:02.099

credit cards,

25:02.101 --> 25:03.968
anything that'll lead to him.

25:03.970 --> 25:05.536
Ruzek, get a beat
on that Suburban.

25:05.538 --> 25:08.572
- Need to get a photo
set in front of Tawny

25:08.574 --> 25:09.907
so she can ID him for us.

25:09.909 --> 25:12.243
- Thank you.
Guys, that's Chicago Med.

25:12.245 --> 25:14.111
They said Tawny just left.

25:14.113 --> 25:19.817

now she's not responding.

25:19.819 --> 25:20.985

36:59.685 --> 37:02.619
- All right, look...

37:02.621 --> 37:07.290
if I got info
on a big score going down,

37:07.292 --> 37:09.259
CIs get what these days?

37:09.261 --> 37:10.694
10%?
- Eddie.

37:10.696 --> 37:13.563
You want to be careful now,
okay?

37:13.565 --> 37:14.965
You don't want to get back
in the game.

37:14.967 --> 37:16.433
Doesn't matter what side
you're on.

37:16.435 --> 37:19.336
- Just answer the question,
Hank.

37:19.338 --> 37:21.972
- Yeah, 10%.

37:21.974 --> 37:23.540
- All right.

37:23.542 --> 37:26.309
Maybe I'll call you
tomorrow.

37:29.513 --> 37:31.248
<i>[music in background]</i>
<i>[overlapping chatter]</i>

37:31.250 --> 37:33.650
- So the girl faked the rape.

37:33.652 --> 37:35.318
- Yeah,
that's what she said.

37:35.320 --> 37:37.254
- Doesn't get more twisted
than that.

37:37.256 --> 37:39.789
- Please tell me
you dragged him out in cuffs.

37:39.791 --> 37:41.491
- Yeah, we got two of 'em,
and then, uh,

37:41.493 --> 37:45.262
Halstead put a bullet
in the raper's head.

37:45.264 --> 37:46.663
- So, Dad, a couple
of the wedding vendors

37:46.665 --> 37:48.698
are waiting for deposits
to be paid,

37:48.700 --> 37:50.867
um, the venue, for starters,

37:50.869 --> 37:53.270
and the caterer,
and the florist.

37:53.272 --> 37:54.904
- Ahh, here we are.

37:54.906 --> 37:56.673
Sustenance.

37:56.675 --> 37:58.408
- Here you go,
30-year-old Ballantine.

37:58.410 --> 38:01.044
Haven't sold one of those in...

38:01.046 --> 38:02.045
Ever.

38:02.047 --> 38:03.713
120 even.

38:03.715 --> 38:04.981
- Start a tab?

38:04.983 --> 38:06.383
If it's all right.

38:06.385 --> 38:07.384
- You can start
whatever you want.

38:07.386 --> 38:08.752
Just keep ordering.

38:11.389 --> 38:12.656
- To my future father-in-law

38:12.658 --> 38:15.458
and his exquisite taste
in aged whiskey.

38:17.728 --> 38:20.063
- So, Dad,
I called your secretary.

38:20.065 --> 38:22.565
These were supposed to be
paid two weeks ago,

38:22.567 --> 38:24.367
and she is giving me
the run-around,

38:24.369 --> 38:27.604
so would you please remind her
or kick her hard?

38:27.606 --> 38:29.673
- Old Frannie.

38:29.675 --> 38:31.875
My strength at the gates.

38:31.877 --> 38:34.477
Had to let her go today.

38:34.479 --> 38:38.815
Pumpkin, I have experienced
some...

38:38.817 --> 38:40.550
reversals.

38:40.552 --> 38:42.886
My resort play in Florida
is upside down,

38:42.888 --> 38:47.490
and as of Friday,
in federal bankruptcy court.

38:47.492 --> 38:52.429
And in the name
of full disclosure,

38:52.431 --> 38:57.367
there was a woman who wasn't
so honest about her agenda.

38:57.369 --> 38:59.502
I won't bore you
with the details.

38:59.504 --> 39:02.405
And the wedding is,

39:02.407 --> 39:05.742
well,
you're on your own.

39:07.712 --> 39:08.978
- What?

39:08.980 --> 39:10.780
- Pumpkin, I'm broke.

39:10.782 --> 39:14.684
Been here before,
and I'll be here again.

39:14.686 --> 39:18.054
- So, the check?

39:18.056 --> 39:21.691
You want to split it or...

39:21.693 --> 39:23.393
You know what, sir?

39:23.395 --> 39:24.394
I got it.

39:24.396 --> 39:29.532
<i>[somber music]</i>

39:30.434 --> 39:32.068
- She's in the guest
room.

39:32.070 --> 39:34.471
She won't even
go back in hers.

39:39.577 --> 39:41.745
[tinny music

39:47.418 --> 39:50.520
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:50.522 --> 39:52.055
- May I?

39:54.592 --> 39:56.826
- Don't tell me they need
to do another test,

39:56.828 --> 39:58.461
'cause I...

39:59.797 --> 40:01.765
- We got him.

40:06.036 --> 40:09.172
He's never gonna hurt
anybody again.
