17:10.762 --> 17:12.597
Hey, Krzys!

17:12.597 --> 17:14.098
Let have a drink.

17:14.098 --> 17:16.334
Have a drink and then
fucking dance with our friends.

17:16.334 --> 17:17.569
Wonderful Idea.

17:17.569 --> 17:20.106
No looking around yet.
You don't have to look around.

17:21.106 --> 17:23.907
Hey, wait, don't
look around here, okay?

17:23.907 --> 17:25.678
We're gonna focus on each other.

17:26.678 --> 17:28.113
Tell you what...

17:28.113 --> 17:30.982
You look like that
guy, you gotta...

17:30.982 --> 17:33.485
You need to have
them look at you.

17:33.485 --> 17:36.522
Don't look at them, everyone's
looking at them already.

17:37.522 --> 17:38.990
But they like it.

17:38.990 --> 17:41.059
Before, I just think
we need like a little...

17:41.059 --> 17:43.661
a little preface on...

17:43.661 --> 17:44.696
Just like, um...

17:44.696 --> 17:47.432
I have a lot of friends,
and I was like,

17:47.432 --> 17:51.236
just gotten into, Out of
relationships you really don't
know what to do.

17:51.236 --> 17:54.772
Let's say you don't know what
to do, you mean, you know
exactly what to do.

17:54.772 --> 17:56.776
But it's a bit of like, uh...

17:58.776 --> 18:00.044
Put it this way...

18:00.044 --> 18:01.113
My number one rule...

18:02.113 --> 18:04.249
with women,

18:04.249 --> 18:06.251
is imagine every woman,
when you walk in the room,

18:06.251 --> 18:08.620
every girl has
a boyfriend already.

18:08.620 --> 18:11.088
There's nothing more
that a woman likes than

18:11.088 --> 18:12.692
somebody with
fucking confidence, man.

18:14.692 --> 18:15.693
Forget it.

18:15.693 --> 18:17.765
Just practice now,
we're just practicing.

18:20.765 --> 18:23.302
Just close your eyes,
it's even better that way.

18:29.507 --> 18:31.344
There you go.

18:33.344 --> 18:35.146
You need more of this.

18:35.146 --> 18:36.916
Move it like this.

18:37.916 --> 18:39.918
Just bring it up.

18:39.918 --> 18:41.390
Time is running out.

18:55.032 --> 18:56.535
Stop thinking so much.

18:59.737 --> 19:00.939
I have to! I have to!

19:00.939 --> 19:02.342
Stop thinking so much.

01:05:27.789 --> 01:05:29.424
-How are you?
-No.

01:05:29.424 --> 01:05:30.726
Who are you?

01:05:30.726 --> 01:05:31.927
Here?

01:05:31.927 --> 01:05:34.730
Your make up, and your dress.

01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:35.965
Yeah?

01:05:36.965 --> 01:05:39.602
You are someone...
I mean,

01:05:40.602 --> 01:05:42.504
some character from the movie,

01:05:42.504 --> 01:05:45.374
or just like...
your imagination?

01:05:45.374 --> 01:05:48.877
Uh-huh. I check, a little bit.

01:05:48.877 --> 01:05:50.920
I don't know exactly...

01:06:06.795 --> 01:06:08.130
Always.

01:06:10.165 --> 01:06:12.247
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

01:16:40.728 --> 01:16:41.769
Okay?

01:18:25.967 --> 01:18:27.112
No need. No need. No problem.

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:46.814
No, I have to go.

01:19:46.814 --> 01:19:48.816
I'd like to say bye to my
friend, okay?

01:19:48.816 --> 01:19:49.029
Okay.

01:20:03.029 --> 01:20:04.067
See you tomorrow.

01:20:06.067 --> 01:20:07.643
-Bye.
-Bye.

01:21:49.069 --> 01:21:49.263
Oh, wow.

01:26:12.566 --> 01:26:13.906
No.

01:26:18.906 --> 01:26:19.769
No.

01:29:21.989 --> 01:29:24.224
It's like a boxing match,
take a break.

01:29:24.224 --> 01:29:26.660
Have some water,
and go back in.

01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:27.756
-Next time, next time.
-Okay!
