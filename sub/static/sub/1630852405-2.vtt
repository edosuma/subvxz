Oh! Ah!

Hey, hey, hey, stop! Stop! Stop.

You're alright. You're alright.

02:31.401 --> 02:35.030
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Just don't hurt me. Okay?

<i>What</i> are you?

02:50.337 --> 02:52.089
Where did you come from?

Why am I asking questions?

02:56.468 --> 02:59.805
Okay, okay. You just stay right there.

02:59.805 --> 03:03.392
Alright? And, uh, I'm gonna
look for a way out of here.

03:17.114 --> 03:20.117
This place is incredible.

03:29.418 --> 03:30.460
Huh.

03:31.378 --> 03:32.838
Well, okay.

03:32.838 --> 03:35.090
I'm just gonna see myself out. Ah!

03:40.971 --> 03:43.140
Hey! Hey, that's my stuff!

Here, take it!
Take it, it's yours! It's yours!

04:01.617 --> 04:04.036
You want some water? Is that it?

04:19.927 --> 04:22.554
I don't think anybody should
know about you right now.

04:28.852 --> 04:31.104
Hey!

04:32.022 --> 04:33.815
Hey!

04:39.404 --> 04:42.282
Wha‐‐ Don't! No, no, no, no, no, no, no...

Wait!

Oh!

05:00.425 --> 05:02.427
Ugh...

05:02.427 --> 05:03.595
Ah!

05:08.684 --> 05:11.186
Sorry. That's all the Loops I got.

05:11.186 --> 05:13.438
Wait a minute. You're hungry.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.941
Okay, yeah.
I can bring you back something to eat.

05:23.907 --> 05:27.202
Whoa! Oh, not again!

05:33.834 --> 05:36.962
Oh, come on! Ah!

05:48.140 --> 05:50.767
‐ There goes the power again.

05:50.767 --> 05:53.979
Chief? Still no idea what's causing that?

05:53.979 --> 05:55.939
‐ Hm...

06:05.407 --> 06:08.035
‐ Oh!

06:08.035 --> 06:09.119
Phew!

06:17.044 --> 06:18.337
Whoa.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.884
Hoo!

06:25.260 --> 06:26.762
Ooh!

06:28.472 --> 06:31.934
‐ Out for a late night stroll, Tom?

06:32.726 --> 06:35.771
‐ Yes?

06:39.650 --> 06:41.485
Mom. It's not what it looks like.

06:41.485 --> 06:44.029
‐ I found him running around
near the fissure.

06:44.029 --> 06:46.406
‐ Okay, it's exactly what it looks like.

06:50.285 --> 06:52.496
‐ I don't even know what
to say to you right now.

06:53.372 --> 06:54.873
I guess your new gritty hairstyle

06:54.873 --> 06:57.042
is part of this rebellious
phase you're going through?

06:59.169 --> 07:02.214
I thought I was clear when I said,
"Stay near the dome."

07:02.214 --> 07:03.257
‐ You were, but‐‐

07:03.257 --> 07:06.093
‐ Wasn't I clear when I said,
"Stay away from the fissure"?

07:06.093 --> 07:07.928
‐ Yes, but th‐there's a‐‐

07:07.928 --> 07:10.639
‐ I don't care what there is, Tom.
Your life is worth more

07:10.639 --> 07:12.349
than a cheap reckless thrill!

07:13.058 --> 07:14.810
Maybe this'll get through.

07:14.810 --> 07:18.397
If you fall into that fissure,
you will be gone forever,

07:18.397 --> 07:20.399
and I don't know what
I would do without you.

07:21.984 --> 07:23.151
‐ I'm sorry.

07:24.611 --> 07:27.990
‐ From this moment forward, when you
are not in school, you will be here.

07:27.990 --> 07:29.908
On weekends, you will be here.

07:29.908 --> 07:32.619
If it's a holiday,
you will be here. Understood?

07:33.287 --> 07:34.288
‐ Got it.

07:34.288 --> 07:37.040
‐ Good. And if you go within
100 yards of that bottomless pit,

07:37.040 --> 07:40.335
so help me, Tom,
I will stick you in the ICARIS jail.

07:40.335 --> 07:41.962
‐ ICARIS has a jail?

07:42.462 --> 07:44.006
‐ Chief Baker will build me one,

07:44.006 --> 07:46.675
and don't think I won't ask,
and don't think he won't do it.

08:05.027 --> 08:06.195
‐ Huh?

08:19.124 --> 08:20.542
Hm.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.058
‐ Tom, wake up.

08:36.058 --> 08:37.768
It's the first day of school.

08:37.768 --> 08:39.269
‐ Huh? Ah!

08:39.269 --> 08:41.647
‐ Well, at least you're already dressed.

08:41.647 --> 08:43.690
A benefit to sleeping in your clothes.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.651
And, apparently, on your desk.

08:45.651 --> 08:47.402
‐ Ow!

08:47.402 --> 08:49.988
‐ They always said,
"Just wait till he's a teen."

08:49.988 --> 08:51.657
But I never listened.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.254
‐ Mm. My dad said

09:05.254 --> 09:08.632
that kid is <i>trouble</i> with a capital T.

09:08.632 --> 09:10.217
‐ Who? Kullersen?

09:11.134 --> 09:13.637
He went back out
to the fissure last night.

09:14.221 --> 09:17.182
Yeah. That platform
isn't even finished yet!

09:17.182 --> 09:18.267
If he took a bad step,

09:18.267 --> 09:21.186
he'd have to grow himself
some wings, real fast.

09:21.186 --> 09:25.023
‐ Nine of swords.
Means you worry too much. Chill.

09:26.233 --> 09:29.528
‐ Chill? I am totally chill.

09:29.528 --> 09:30.904
Don't I look chill?

09:32.656 --> 09:34.658
Why don't you talk?!

09:35.576 --> 09:37.619
I thought we had an agreement, Kullersen.

09:37.619 --> 09:39.955
You weren't going back to the fissure.

09:39.955 --> 09:43.166
‐ I seem to be hearing this a lot lately.
‐ I warned you...

09:43.166 --> 09:45.419
‐ No, you said you read my chart

09:45.419 --> 09:47.963
and something <i>big</i> was gonna happen.
That's pretty vague.

09:47.963 --> 09:49.423
‐ Did something big happen?

09:49.882 --> 09:52.509
‐ Kinda, yeah. Maybe.

09:52.509 --> 09:53.802
I don't know.

09:53.802 --> 09:55.512
‐ Talk about vague.

09:58.056 --> 10:00.434
‐ What do you think they're
talking about over there?

10:01.727 --> 10:05.480
If they're plotting something, my dad
is gonna bust them big time.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.107
Am I right?

10:09.276 --> 10:11.486
I got a real bad feeling about this.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.616
Nothing?! Okay...

10:15.991 --> 10:18.994
‐ I think you saw something down there.

10:19.703 --> 10:22.456
‐
Okay yes, yes. I saw something.

10:24.499 --> 10:26.335
‐ A moth? Very funny.

10:26.335 --> 10:28.378
‐ It's not a moth!

10:29.046 --> 10:31.423
Is it?
‐ You never could draw, Kullersen.

10:31.423 --> 10:33.509
Too busy breaking your crayons.

10:34.009 --> 10:36.136
‐ It's a bat, maybe?

10:36.136 --> 10:38.305
Or‐or‐or a pterodactyl.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.848
Some kind of flying dinosaur?

10:40.557 --> 10:41.892
‐ Wait, for real?

10:42.434 --> 10:45.145
It <i>could</i> be a dinosaur,

10:45.145 --> 10:48.273
or a dragon!
‐ Thought you said it was a moth.

10:48.273 --> 10:50.651
‐ Maybe like a moth‐like dragon.

10:50.651 --> 10:54.446
Round face, four legs, some fangs...

10:54.446 --> 10:55.822
Ugh, needs better wings.

10:55.822 --> 10:58.492
‐ I'm having flashbacks to kindergarten.

10:58.492 --> 11:00.077
Dragons aren't real, Jun.

11:00.077 --> 11:02.746
‐ Dragon stories have been
around for thousands of years,

11:02.746 --> 11:04.414
in every country and culture.

11:04.414 --> 11:07.543
They had to come from somewhere.
Dragons are real.

11:07.543 --> 11:09.753
I'm sure of it.
Mm‐mmm.

11:09.753 --> 11:13.173
If dragons were real,
humanity would exterminate them.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.759
Dragons would be hunted to the ends
of the Earth, chased down,

11:15.759 --> 11:17.928
and turned into boots, belts, and burgers.

11:17.928 --> 11:19.763
Big business would exploit them,

11:19.763 --> 11:22.641
reducing them to
a tiny column of profit margins

11:22.641 --> 11:25.435
on an endless spreadsheet of <i>doom</i>...

11:26.311 --> 11:29.314
Let's face it. A real dragon
would end up a dead dragon.

11:30.440 --> 11:33.527
‐ I liked it better when you didn't talk.

11:35.571 --> 11:36.864
‐ Kullersen, wait up!

11:36.864 --> 11:39.575
So, what are we gonna
do about your dragon?

11:39.575 --> 11:42.911
‐ <i>We're</i> not doing anything.
And it's not a dragon.

11:42.911 --> 11:44.872
‐ Will you just try to open your mind?

11:44.872 --> 11:47.583
There's a whole world out
there that we don't understand.

11:50.210 --> 11:53.213
Thunder? There's not a cloud in the sky.

12:01.430 --> 12:04.433
‐ Okay, time to feed
a giant flying cave creature.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.731
Mom! Hey, uh,
I thought you were at work.

12:10.731 --> 12:12.983
‐ I was. I forgot some spreadsheets.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.445
That's quite a lunch.

12:16.945 --> 12:18.530
‐ Uh, yeah! Right.

12:18.530 --> 12:20.866
Well, you can never eat
too many hamburgers.

12:20.866 --> 12:24.119
‐ Guess not.
I might be working late tonight.

12:24.119 --> 12:26.538
‐ H‐hey, Mom, um, can I ask you something?

12:26.538 --> 12:28.207
‐ Sure. What's up?

12:28.207 --> 12:31.168
‐ What'll happen if we actually discover
something down in the fissure?

12:31.168 --> 12:32.961
‐ Like what? A new mineral?

12:32.961 --> 12:36.006
‐ Yeah. A‐a mineral or a plant

12:36.006 --> 12:38.175
or a new animal maybe...

12:38.175 --> 12:41.094
‐ Discovering a new species?
That would be incredible.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.514
‐ Yeah, we‐we could study it, right?
You and me!

12:43.514 --> 12:46.308
Figure out what it is
and where it came from.

12:46.308 --> 12:49.019
‐ Imagine the science.
‐ It would be awesome!

12:49.019 --> 12:51.772
‐ The Rakke Corp would
be very relieved, too.

12:51.772 --> 12:53.774
‐ The Rakke Corp? What do you mean?

12:53.774 --> 12:57.486
‐ Well, they've invested a billion
dollars into this expedition.

12:57.486 --> 12:59.988
They're expecting us to find
something pretty big.

12:59.988 --> 13:02.407
A new species would go a long way.

13:02.407 --> 13:06.078
‐ So, you're saying whatever we might find
will just end up as a profit margin

13:06.078 --> 13:08.497
on an endless Rakke Corp
spreadsheet of doom.

13:08.497 --> 13:10.916
‐ That's pretty dark, boy‐o.

13:10.916 --> 13:12.793
‐ I thought we were here for science,

13:12.793 --> 13:15.337
not to help Rakke Corp make money.

13:15.337 --> 13:16.880
‐ What's this really about?

13:17.673 --> 13:20.342
‐ Okay... Listen, when I was‐‐

13:22.094 --> 13:24.137
‐ This is Dr. Kullersen.

13:24.137 --> 13:27.933
Yes, May, I agree.
The earthquakes are a problem.

13:27.933 --> 13:29.810
I will be right there.

13:29.810 --> 13:32.688
Gotta go. The Rakke Corp
wants an update immediately.

13:35.858 --> 13:38.360
‐ Yeah. I bet they do.

13:39.027 --> 13:40.362
Okay, got the food.

13:40.362 --> 13:43.282
Now I just need to figure out where
the cave to that creature is.

13:46.493 --> 13:47.744
Okay, maps.

13:47.744 --> 13:49.746
Map to the secret cave.

13:49.746 --> 13:51.957
Where are you...

13:51.957 --> 13:53.792
Probably won't say
"map to the secret cave."

13:53.792 --> 13:54.960
‐ Hi.
‐ Ah!

13:56.295 --> 13:57.421
Where did you come from?

13:58.088 --> 14:00.299
‐ I was born in Tuscaloosa.

14:01.717 --> 14:03.552
‐ How long have you been standing there?

14:03.969 --> 14:06.972
‐ Long enough to notice that even
with all these maps, you're still lost.

14:07.764 --> 14:09.725
‐ Oh, right. Yeah. Yeah.

14:09.725 --> 14:12.728
I'm just checking out the caves
in the area. You know, because...

14:13.395 --> 14:16.190
I like caves.
‐ I like caves, too.

14:16.857 --> 14:18.734
They're dark.

14:19.818 --> 14:21.945
But, those maps are useless.

14:21.945 --> 14:24.865
When the fissure opened up,
it shifted everything around.

14:24.865 --> 14:27.117
Might as well file them
with the map of Pangea.

14:30.162 --> 14:31.872
‐ I hadn't thought of that.

14:32.706 --> 14:34.082
Thanks, Alex.

14:35.334 --> 14:36.585
‐ I have the new maps.

14:37.961 --> 14:41.215
Drawn by the Rakke Corp's
own seismic cartographer.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.510
‐ Wait, how did you get those?
‐ I didn't.

14:44.510 --> 14:47.179
Cinnabot538 hacked them
off the ICARIS server.

14:48.472 --> 14:50.974
‐ Well, do you think Cinnabot538
might be able

14:50.974 --> 14:53.936
to send those maps to my phone?

14:53.936 --> 14:56.313
‐ I think Cinnabot538

14:56.313 --> 14:58.815
can do anything she wants.

15:18.627 --> 15:22.422
‐ Your boy seems to have a hard time
following the rules, Dr. Kullersen.

15:22.422 --> 15:25.092
‐ Look, this is a new situation for Tom.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.593
It's gonna take some time,

15:26.593 --> 15:28.512
but he is a good kid.

15:28.512 --> 15:29.972
I'm beefing up security

15:29.972 --> 15:32.266
around the station until I can figure out

15:32.266 --> 15:35.477
what the heck is going on with the
electrical systems and alarms going off.

15:35.477 --> 15:37.771
You don't think
Tom has anything to do with it?

15:39.314 --> 15:42.484
‐ I didn't say that.
Just means more patrols,

15:42.484 --> 15:44.862
which might help
your boy stay on the right path.

15:48.365 --> 15:49.783
‐ Gotcha!

16:23.817 --> 16:25.277
‐ <i>Hello?</i>

16:27.029 --> 16:28.989
<i>I'm back!</i>

16:28.989 --> 16:30.115
Huh.

16:31.283 --> 16:33.410
<i>Dinner time!</i>

16:33.410 --> 16:35.120
<i>Come and get it!</i>

16:36.830 --> 16:37.748
Ah!

16:42.920 --> 16:44.505
I brought you some food.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.177
Huh.

16:50.177 --> 16:53.222
The only creature on the planet
that doesn't like pizza.

16:53.222 --> 16:55.182
Ah! Ah!

16:56.141 --> 16:58.060
Hey!

17:04.691 --> 17:07.986
There you go. Alright.
Now we're getting somewhere.

17:11.990 --> 17:14.993
Or not. Oh no.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no‐‐

17:14.993 --> 17:17.037
Ugh!

17:20.165 --> 17:22.751
Hm. Guess you're not a fan of spaghetti.

17:25.629 --> 17:27.256
Hm?

17:28.131 --> 17:29.258
Huh?

17:29.591 --> 17:31.468
Ah!

17:39.685 --> 17:42.145
What the heck do dragons eat?

17:46.233 --> 17:49.236
There's these. Frozen fish nuggets.

17:49.611 --> 17:52.489
Ugh. Nobody likes frozen fish nuggets.

18:08.255 --> 18:11.300
Alright. Fish. Dragons like fish.

18:12.259 --> 18:14.761
Oh no, I‐I'm good. I'm good.

18:17.931 --> 18:20.392
If fish nuggets were
the last food on the planet,

18:20.392 --> 18:22.853
I would happily starve. Mm!

18:22.853 --> 18:25.397
Okay.

18:25.397 --> 18:26.815
Thanks...

18:26.815 --> 18:28.358
I think I'll save this one for later.

18:28.358 --> 18:30.736
Uh...

18:42.497 --> 18:43.498
Yum...

18:48.504 --> 18:51.632
We're gonna split this whole
pile of nugs, aren't we?

18:55.010 --> 18:57.137
Okay, that's it.

18:57.137 --> 18:59.556
No, no. No more.

18:59.556 --> 19:01.391
I can't do it. Not another nug.

19:01.391 --> 19:03.602
I just ate one!

19:03.602 --> 19:05.145
The last one's yours!

19:06.939 --> 19:08.857
Alright, alright, alright.

19:08.857 --> 19:10.859
Last one's mine. Just...

19:10.859 --> 19:12.903
Just gimme a sec.

19:17.658 --> 19:19.368
We did it. We're done. Phew!

19:19.952 --> 19:22.204
Oh...

19:51.859 --> 19:54.486
Ah!

20:09.793 --> 20:12.588
So, what do you wanna do now?

20:13.630 --> 20:17.217
Woo‐hoo!

20:17.217 --> 20:19.928
Oh...

20:19.928 --> 20:21.930
Woo‐hoo!

20:25.017 --> 20:27.227
Woo!

20:29.813 --> 20:32.232
Woo!

20:33.358 --> 20:34.526
Yeah!

20:40.574 --> 20:42.284
Woo‐hoo!

20:43.160 --> 20:44.453
Yeah!

20:46.121 --> 20:47.956
This is amazing!

20:53.504 --> 20:56.131
Earthquake? Whoa!

20:56.131 --> 20:58.217
Watch out!

21:00.969 --> 21:03.430
Whoa!

21:03.430 --> 21:04.598
Oh!

21:21.365 --> 21:23.116
Did you do that on purpose?

21:24.284 --> 21:25.619
Whoa! Ah!

21:28.789 --> 21:31.208
Blast those suckers! Yeah!

21:31.834 --> 21:32.835
Watch out!

21:32.835 --> 21:35.087
Alright, get us outta here!

21:44.054 --> 21:45.264
Phew.

21:46.014 --> 21:48.016
That was a big one.

22:16.336 --> 22:18.338
Whoa...
