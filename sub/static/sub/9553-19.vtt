Fonz, we're never gonna
make it without No Doz.

01:36.710 --> 01:37.710
Yeah, these guys
need help, Fonz.

01:37.710 --> 01:38.720
Let me tell
you something.

01:38.720 --> 01:40.220
First of all, you
don't get no No Doz--

01:40.220 --> 01:42.220
I don't know what that is--
you don't get no pills.

01:42.220 --> 01:43.520
You got me!

01:43.520 --> 01:45.610
Yeah, but Fonz, I can't remember
one thing I looked at,

01:45.610 --> 01:47.440
especially tomorrow morning,
I'm going to be dead.

01:47.440 --> 01:48.530
All right.
I can't remember
a thing.

01:48.530 --> 01:50.530
All right, all right,
all right, knock it off!

01:50.530 --> 01:51.530
Knock it off!

01:51.530 --> 01:53.400
Fonzie's right.

01:53.400 --> 01:55.480
FONZIE:
All right, get these guys
started on the next chapter.

01:55.480 --> 01:56.980
Watch them; they
will try anything.

01:56.980 --> 01:58.070
RICHIE:
Right.

01:58.070 --> 01:59.150
I got business.

01:59.150 --> 02:01.070
You can depend on me, Fonz;
I'll watch these guys.

02:01.070 --> 02:03.160
Yeah.
(chuckles)

02:07.160 --> 02:08.660
Let's get
out of here!
Huh? What? What? What?

02:08.660 --> 02:10.160
Come on.
What are you doing?

02:10.160 --> 02:11.660
I thought you were
supposed to watch us.

02:11.660 --> 02:13.170
I was faking!

02:13.170 --> 02:14.670
I'd lie to my grandmother
for sleep.

02:14.670 --> 02:16.170
Let's get out of here.
All right.

02:28.260 --> 02:30.270
Joanie, stabbing
the table is not

02:30.270 --> 02:32.270
going to make me
change my mind.

02:32.270 --> 02:34.770
But, Dad, you promised
when I got to be a sophomore,

02:34.770 --> 02:35.860
I could car date.

02:35.860 --> 02:38.440
Now is not the time
to talk to your father

02:38.440 --> 02:39.940
about car dates, dear.

02:39.940 --> 02:42.000
He's worried about
Richard's test.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.450
And you're not?

02:43.450 --> 02:44.500
Well, I am, dear.

02:44.500 --> 02:46.530
It's just that
when I worry, I cook,

02:46.530 --> 02:47.830
and when you worry, you eat.

02:50.040 --> 02:52.210
That's why we have
a happy marriage.

02:52.210 --> 02:54.790
And that's why
you have a happy tummy.

02:57.260 --> 02:58.800
By the time
you car date,

02:58.800 --> 03:02.470
you're going to be
wearing support hose.

03:02.470 --> 03:03.550
(car horn honks)

03:03.550 --> 03:04.520
Oh, that's them!

03:07.050 --> 03:08.560
Does it look like
they passed, Mom?

03:08.560 --> 03:11.060
Oh, they look very happy,
except Potsie;

03:11.060 --> 03:14.060
he's got his foot
caught in the door.

03:14.060 --> 03:16.560
RICHIE & RALPH (chanting):
One-three-five-nine,

03:16.560 --> 03:18.060
who do we think is mighty fine?

03:18.060 --> 03:20.070
Hygiene! Hygiene!

03:20.070 --> 03:22.040
Yay!

03:22.040 --> 03:24.200
I think they passed.

03:24.200 --> 03:25.290
(laughing):
Yeah.

03:25.290 --> 03:26.290
We can
graduate now.

03:26.290 --> 03:28.290
Yeah, I could have gotten
an "A," but I thought a larynx

03:28.290 --> 03:31.580
was an animal
that attacked sheep.

03:31.580 --> 03:33.660
(chanting):
One-three-five-nine...

03:33.660 --> 03:34.660
It's over, Potsie.

03:34.660 --> 03:36.670
It's over?

03:36.670 --> 03:37.670
Are you going to
graduate, too?

03:37.670 --> 03:38.500
Yeah.

03:40.750 --> 03:42.340
Well, congratulations,
guys.

03:42.340 --> 03:44.340
I suppose you're going to go
out and celebrate now, huh?

03:44.340 --> 03:45.340
Oh, yeah.
POTSIE:
No kidding.

03:45.340 --> 03:46.840
Yeah, well,
they'd take me with them,

03:46.840 --> 03:48.730
but you won't let me car date.

03:51.100 --> 03:52.600
Fonz.
Hey, Fonz,
did you hear?

03:52.600 --> 03:54.100
They passed.
We passed
the hygiene test.

03:54.100 --> 03:55.600
I think that's great,
I think that's great.

03:55.600 --> 03:56.600
They're not gonna
get away with this.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.610
I thought you
wanted us to pass.

03:58.610 --> 04:00.610
Hey, Fonzie, this says
you graduated high school!

04:00.610 --> 04:01.610
Congratulations!
Arthur, that's
wonderful!

04:01.610 --> 04:03.280
That's great!

04:03.280 --> 04:04.360
Not that part.

04:04.360 --> 04:05.360
Look at this.

04:05.360 --> 04:08.780
"You will receive your
diploma in the mail."

04:08.780 --> 04:09.870
Now, do you
believe that?

04:10.370 --> 04:11.370
You believe that?

04:11.370 --> 04:13.750
I worked my way all the
way through night school.

04:13.750 --> 04:17.010
I locked myself in my room
with my little notebook.

04:17.010 --> 04:18.089
Huh?

04:18.089 --> 04:20.089
I mean, I even took
long division,

04:20.089 --> 04:22.600
I studied my heart out.

04:22.600 --> 04:25.600
And now they want to send me
my diploma in the mail,

04:25.600 --> 04:27.050
like I was a "Dear Occupant."

04:28.850 --> 04:31.940
Well, let me tell you something,
I'm no "Dear Occupant,"

04:31.940 --> 04:34.440
I am the valedictorian
of my class!

04:34.440 --> 04:37.360
And I'm going to be
in that ceremony!

04:37.360 --> 04:39.400
(door slams)

04:40.860 --> 04:43.450
I didn't know he
was valedictorian.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.870
Yeah, he was the only one
in his class.

04:45.870 --> 04:49.460
Ah, they shouldn't
do that to the Fonz.

04:49.460 --> 04:50.240
That's really bad.

04:51.460 --> 04:53.040
Well, let me tell
you something.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.540
After all he's
done for us,

04:54.540 --> 04:56.500
I'm not going to let
them get away with this.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.080
All right!
Yeah, that's right!

04:58.080 --> 04:59.080
We're gonna get,
we're gonna get

04:59.080 --> 05:01.080
every senior in school
to sign a petition!

05:01.080 --> 05:02.340
All right!
Yeah!
Let's go!

05:06.220 --> 05:09.310
Mr. Connors, now,
before I say anything,

05:09.310 --> 05:11.310
I'd appreciate it if you'd
just take a deep breath,

05:11.810 --> 05:13.810
and-and listen to
the whole thing, all right?

05:13.810 --> 05:15.150
Okay.

05:15.150 --> 05:19.240
Arthur Fonzarelli has just
graduated from night school,

05:19.240 --> 05:21.350
and we want him in our ceremony.

05:21.350 --> 05:22.440
Oh, no, no, no.

05:22.940 --> 05:23.940
It is out of the question.

05:23.940 --> 05:25.440
Night school students
must receive

05:25.440 --> 05:27.030
their diploma in the mail.

05:27.030 --> 05:29.110
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have other things to do.

05:29.610 --> 05:30.610
Oh, but he
deserves it.
(boys talking)

05:30.610 --> 05:31.610
He worked really hard.

05:31.610 --> 05:33.420
Come on, he worked
as hard as we did.

05:33.420 --> 05:36.000
I did it, Connors,
I did it!

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Oh, Principal Haley,
we need to talk to you.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.010
Yes, you do.
Connors, I did it.

05:40.010 --> 05:42.130
I just persuaded the mayor
to make a speech.

05:42.130 --> 05:44.210
Oh, no, no,
that's impossible.

05:44.210 --> 05:46.210
Last week,
at Fillmore High School,

05:46.210 --> 05:48.210
the students tore up
the gymnasium

05:48.720 --> 05:50.350
during a lecture
on juvenile delinquency.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.930
HALEY:
What does a Fillmore riot
got to do

05:51.930 --> 05:53.520
with our Jefferson High
graduation?

05:53.520 --> 05:56.110
They're going to use our
gymnasium for their graduation.

05:56.110 --> 05:58.360
We'll have to be out of here
at 6:00 sharp.

05:58.360 --> 06:00.390
Now, we're working on
a very tight schedule.

06:00.390 --> 06:02.730
We will not be able to have time
for the mayor's speech.

06:02.730 --> 06:04.310
Right.
The mayor's out.

06:04.310 --> 06:05.310
That's how
to make a decision.

06:05.310 --> 06:07.320
That's why
I'm principal.

06:07.320 --> 06:09.320
Mr. Haley...
Is this going
to be a riot?

06:09.320 --> 06:10.820
No.

06:10.820 --> 06:12.320
No, sir, but we
have a problem.

06:12.320 --> 06:15.830
You see... a friend of
ours, Arthur Fonzarelli,

06:15.830 --> 06:17.830
has graduated from
the night school,

06:17.830 --> 06:20.500
and-and we would all like
to have him in our ceremony.

06:20.500 --> 06:21.580
Well?

06:21.580 --> 06:22.580
I'm sorry, sir.

06:22.580 --> 06:24.080
Rules are rules.

06:24.080 --> 06:26.590
Night school students
cannot join our ceremony.

06:26.590 --> 06:27.590
Why, that's
terrible!

06:27.590 --> 06:29.590
Let's change that.

06:29.590 --> 06:30.510
It won't hurt
anything.

06:30.510 --> 06:31.590
He can sit
with the class.

06:35.310 --> 06:37.400
Connors, take care of it.

06:39.150 --> 06:40.230
CONNORS:
All right, very well.

06:40.230 --> 06:41.430
Fonzarelli can
join the ceremony.

06:41.430 --> 06:43.520
But no diploma;
it's already in the mail.

06:43.520 --> 06:44.520
Now, don't
dillydally here.

06:44.520 --> 06:45.520
Right.
Great, thanks.

06:45.520 --> 06:46.520
What are you doing on

06:46.520 --> 06:49.030
the gymnasium floor
with street shoes?!

06:49.030 --> 06:50.030
Don't you see
what I'm wearing?

06:50.530 --> 06:52.530
These are little gum soles--
gum, gum, gum.

06:52.530 --> 06:54.030
Right.
Out, out, out!

06:54.030 --> 06:55.030
Wait till
we tell him.

06:55.030 --> 06:58.030
(all chattering excitedly)

06:58.030 --> 06:59.540
Oh, Fonz!
Fonz!

06:59.540 --> 07:00.540
Hey, all right, all right.

07:00.540 --> 07:01.540
You think you can
stop chattering

07:01.540 --> 07:03.510
and just tell me
where the Principal Haley is?

07:03.510 --> 07:05.090
Oh, you don't have to
worry about it, Fonz.

07:05.090 --> 07:06.930
We just talked to
Principal Haley; it's okay.

07:06.930 --> 07:08.010
Just look at
that petition.

07:08.010 --> 07:09.550
We got everyone
to sign it.
RICHIE:
Yeah.

07:09.550 --> 07:10.630
I signed it twice.

07:13.130 --> 07:14.630
You did this for me?

07:15.130 --> 07:16.140
I'm really touched.

07:16.140 --> 07:17.640
Thanks a lot.

07:17.640 --> 07:19.890
All right,
now I can work on my speech.

07:21.360 --> 07:22.940
What speech, Fonz?

07:22.940 --> 07:24.440
Well, why would
the valedictorian

07:24.440 --> 07:27.310
be in the ceremony
and not make a speech?

07:27.310 --> 07:28.900
Oh. Oh, yeah, right.

07:28.900 --> 07:31.450
Well, we-we just haven't ironed
that out yet, that's all.

07:31.450 --> 07:33.040
Yeah, well, all right,
you work on that,

07:33.040 --> 07:34.540
and I'll work on my speech, dig?

07:34.540 --> 07:36.540
All right.

07:36.540 --> 07:38.070
Dear Faculty, fellow graduates,

07:38.070 --> 07:39.540
my-my many
chicks.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.000
Are you loony?

07:45.000 --> 07:46.550
You know that he can't
speak at the graduation.

07:46.550 --> 07:48.050
And you should have told him

07:48.050 --> 07:49.970
that he can't get
his diploma at the ceremony.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.550
Well, I wasn't
going to,

07:51.550 --> 07:53.560
because I'm not going to
spoil this for Fonzie.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.060
Look, it's-it's just
a time problem.

07:55.560 --> 07:57.060
They're worried about how long
the ceremony is going to take,

07:57.060 --> 07:59.560
so we just got to find
some way to speed it up.

07:59.560 --> 08:01.560
Well, don't worry
about a thing, guys.

08:01.560 --> 08:02.930
I'll think of something.

08:02.930 --> 08:05.490
Potsie, this is no time
for a first.

08:05.490 --> 08:11.070
♪ La, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la. ♪

08:11.070 --> 08:14.160
You wear it on the right,
and then when you graduate,

08:14.160 --> 08:15.660
you move it
over to the left.

08:15.660 --> 08:17.160
(door buzzer sounds)
Oh, I love it.

08:17.160 --> 08:18.660
Oh, I'll get it,
I'll get it.

08:20.670 --> 08:22.170
Oh, Spike,
come on in.

08:22.170 --> 08:23.170
It's Spike.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.170
HOWARD:
Hi, Spike.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.170
Oh, my goodness.

08:29.180 --> 08:31.180
Hi. Come to see
Uncle Fonz graduate.

08:31.180 --> 08:32.799
He said to meet him here.

08:32.799 --> 08:35.380
Oh, Spike,
it's so good to see you.

08:35.380 --> 08:36.770
And you brought flowers.

08:36.770 --> 08:39.270
Yeah. I get a discount
at the florist where I work.

08:40.640 --> 08:41.720
(knock at door)

08:41.720 --> 08:42.720
I'll get it.

08:45.690 --> 08:47.730
Oh. Arthur.

08:52.230 --> 08:54.230
Hey, Spike, it is
very nice to see you,

08:54.230 --> 08:56.040
and I am touched
that you made it.

08:56.040 --> 08:59.120
Hey, I wouldn't miss this for
all the marigolds in Milwaukee.

08:59.120 --> 09:01.210
I think that is fabbo.

09:01.210 --> 09:03.490
He picked up
a little flower humor.

09:03.490 --> 09:04.630
MARION:
Oh, Arthur,

09:04.630 --> 09:08.210
you look so smart in
your cap and gown.

09:08.210 --> 09:09.130
HOWARD:
Come on, Richard,

09:09.130 --> 09:10.220
stand next to Fonzie.

09:10.220 --> 09:11.220
I want to get a picture.

09:11.220 --> 09:12.720
Yeah, I'd like
this one for my book.

09:12.720 --> 09:13.720
All right,
come on now.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.720
Howard gave Richard
a new camera for graduation.

09:15.720 --> 09:17.510
Yeah.

09:17.510 --> 09:19.090
This is a terrific new camera.

09:19.090 --> 09:21.140
Develops a picture
in 60 seconds.

09:21.140 --> 09:22.900
You know how to work that
all right, Dad?

09:22.900 --> 09:24.480
Well, of course I do, Richard.

09:24.980 --> 09:26.480
I read the instructions
right here in the back.

09:26.480 --> 09:29.520
It says, "Pull tab out..."

09:29.520 --> 09:32.270
Is it supposed
to do that?

09:32.270 --> 09:34.860
No, it's not supposed
to do that, Fonzie.

09:35.360 --> 09:36.440
(knock at door)

09:36.440 --> 09:39.030
Come in!

09:39.030 --> 09:41.030
Hi, everybody.
It's me.

09:41.030 --> 09:43.030
JOANIE:
Hi, Al.

09:43.030 --> 09:45.030
Fonzie, you
look terrific!

09:45.030 --> 09:46.540
(chuckles)

09:46.540 --> 09:49.010
Wow, look at the
nice new camera!

09:50.920 --> 09:52.510
Howard, take
our picture.

09:52.510 --> 09:54.040
No film.

09:54.040 --> 09:57.130
Wow, that is new!

09:57.130 --> 09:59.130
Well, we don't want to be
late for the graduation.

09:59.130 --> 10:00.630
Now everybody
can come with me

10:00.630 --> 10:03.140
'cause I-I brought along
my catering truck.

10:03.140 --> 10:05.940
HOWARD:
Well, we kind of thought
we'd go in my De Soto, Al.

10:05.940 --> 10:07.520
I'll go with
you, Al.

10:07.520 --> 10:10.530
It's my first
car date.

10:10.530 --> 10:12.530
Hey, wait up.
I'll go, too.

10:12.530 --> 10:13.950
I love feisty
chicks.

10:15.280 --> 10:18.530
Sit on it, Spike.

10:18.530 --> 10:19.620
(chuckles)

10:19.620 --> 10:22.290
What a cute couple.

10:22.290 --> 10:25.320
Fonz, uh, you know,
everybody's waiting

10:25.320 --> 10:27.830
till they get to school
to put on their cap and gown.

10:27.830 --> 10:28.910
Hey, let me tell
you something, Red.

10:29.410 --> 10:30.910
I worked very,
very hard for this.

10:30.910 --> 10:33.420
I'm going to wear it
every minute I can.

10:33.920 --> 10:35.750
I think I'm going to
walk to school in it.

10:35.750 --> 10:39.060
It's a pretty warm day
to wear your gown.

10:39.060 --> 10:40.590
That's no problem for me.

10:40.590 --> 10:42.640
I am naked underneath this.

10:46.650 --> 10:48.230
Darn this thing.

10:48.730 --> 10:50.730
Oh, now, Howard, don't
be so upset, dear.

10:50.730 --> 10:53.740
A camera that takes pictures
in 60 seconds.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.240
It'll never sell.

10:55.240 --> 10:56.240
Come on, let's get going.

10:56.240 --> 10:58.240
I've got to pick up
some more film.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.240
Come on, Richard, it's
time to leave, dear.

11:00.240 --> 11:02.240
Well, Richard,
aren't you coming?

11:02.240 --> 11:03.330
Oh.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.330
Oh, yeah, Mom.

11:05.330 --> 11:08.330
I just wanted to reflect
for a moment.

11:08.330 --> 11:11.340
Do you realize that the next
time I walk into this room,

11:11.340 --> 11:13.290
I'm going to be
a high school graduate?

11:13.290 --> 11:16.380
I'll be a completely
changed person.

11:16.380 --> 11:19.380
You'll always be the
same person to us, dear.

11:19.380 --> 11:20.880
No, he's right, Marion.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.130
He will be a changed person.

11:22.130 --> 11:23.180
Yeah, yeah, Dad's right.

11:23.680 --> 11:26.220
I'm going to have
new responsibilities.

11:26.220 --> 11:28.220
I'm going to have to start
being more adult.

11:28.220 --> 11:29.720
(car horn honks)

11:29.720 --> 11:31.220
SUZIE:
Come on, Richie!

11:31.220 --> 11:33.810
I'll give you a ride to
school in my new T-bird!

11:33.810 --> 11:35.900
Holy moly, that's Suzie!

11:35.900 --> 11:37.400
(chuckles)

11:37.400 --> 11:38.900
Oh, she is great.

11:38.900 --> 11:42.400
♪ I found my thrill. ♪

11:49.460 --> 11:50.460
(sniffles)

11:50.460 --> 11:51.910
Are you crying?

11:51.910 --> 11:54.460
Oh, Howard.

11:54.460 --> 11:57.470
Our baby's
grown up.

11:57.470 --> 11:58.970
No, she's not.

11:58.970 --> 12:00.470
I mean Richard.

12:00.470 --> 12:01.470
Oh.

12:01.470 --> 12:04.470
He's been such
a good boy.

12:04.470 --> 12:05.980
Yes, he has.

12:05.980 --> 12:09.480
Marion, you did
a terrific job raising him.

12:09.480 --> 12:10.480
Thank you, dear.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.980
Mm-hmm.

12:11.980 --> 12:14.480
You helped,
too, Howard.

12:14.480 --> 12:16.990
Thank you, Marion.

12:16.990 --> 12:19.990
But with Joanie, I think
we're in big trouble.

12:30.530 --> 12:32.120
(crowd murmuring)

12:36.590 --> 12:38.670
Just think,

12:38.670 --> 12:42.180
in just three years,
you'll be up there.

12:42.180 --> 12:43.180
Do you think
by then

12:43.180 --> 12:45.680
Dad'll be able
to work the camera, Mom?

12:45.680 --> 12:47.180
Very funny.

12:47.180 --> 12:49.190
You're wasting a
lot of film, Howard.

12:49.190 --> 12:50.190
Better let
me help.

12:50.190 --> 12:53.190
Thanks a lot, Al,
but I can do it myself.

12:53.190 --> 12:54.690
Oh.

12:54.690 --> 12:57.190
In 60 seconds,
you're going to
have a nice picture

12:57.690 --> 12:59.200
of an angry
face.

12:59.200 --> 13:01.700
Just kidding.
Oh.

13:01.700 --> 13:03.900
(man speaking Japanese)

13:03.900 --> 13:05.990
ARNOLD:
Of course
I got my own ticket.

13:05.990 --> 13:08.700
Now just step out
of my way, Shorty.

13:08.700 --> 13:10.290
HOWARD:
Hey, look,
it's Arnold!

13:16.830 --> 13:21.920
Oh, Arnold, I'm so glad
you could make it!

13:21.920 --> 13:25.000
Oh, I would not have missed this
for all the tea in China.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.510
(laughs)

13:26.510 --> 13:27.510
Hi, Al.
Hey, hi, Arnold.

13:27.510 --> 13:30.010
Good to see you.
Oh, you're looking
so good.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.480
How's business?

13:31.480 --> 13:34.560
Oh, it's the best move I
ever made in my entire life.

13:34.560 --> 13:36.070
I love to be
with those kids.

13:36.570 --> 13:37.600
Keeps me young.

13:37.600 --> 13:39.270
Ah, no profits, huh?

13:39.270 --> 13:40.350
Not a cent.

13:40.350 --> 13:41.850
Yeah, I know
the feeling.

13:41.850 --> 13:42.860
JOANIE:
Hi, Arnold.

13:42.860 --> 13:44.360
Hey, Shortcakes!

13:44.360 --> 13:46.860
Look at Shortcakes!

13:46.860 --> 13:48.860
Well, pretty soon,
she getting to be Longcakes.

13:48.860 --> 13:51.360
(laughs)

13:53.870 --> 13:55.870
(drum roll)

14:04.090 --> 14:06.680
Thank you, girls.

14:09.100 --> 14:11.350
I, uh...

14:11.350 --> 14:13.440
I want
to, uh, welcome all of you

14:13.440 --> 14:16.390
to our Jefferson High School
program.

14:16.390 --> 14:17.690
And now,

14:17.690 --> 14:19.780
I want to introduce

14:19.780 --> 14:22.280
Assistant Principal
Marvin Connors,

14:22.280 --> 14:25.280
who will be your host
for the rest of the ceremony.

14:25.280 --> 14:26.870
(applause)

14:26.870 --> 14:27.950
Don't forget the plan.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.450
We've got to save time
for Fonzie's speech.

14:29.950 --> 14:30.950
Pass it on, okay?
Right,
right.

14:31.450 --> 14:32.450
You guys, speed
everything up.

14:32.450 --> 14:33.960
Everything we do
is speeded up.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.960
Now, look, when you introduce
the class awards, make it fast.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.460
Yeah, yeah, sure,
right after my comedy routine.

14:37.460 --> 14:38.960
No routine.
Oh...

14:38.960 --> 14:39.960
Ralph!

14:39.960 --> 14:41.460
All right,
I'll do it real fast.

14:41.460 --> 14:43.550
I'll only do
the punch lines.
All right.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.130
And now it is time

14:45.130 --> 14:47.970
to bring in the graduating class
and orchestra,

14:47.970 --> 14:50.720
which will play
"Pomp and Circumstance."

14:50.720 --> 14:51.810
Here we go!

14:51.810 --> 14:54.730
(speeded-up version of
"Pomp and Circumstances" plays)

15:07.320 --> 15:08.860
Why so fast?

15:08.860 --> 15:10.410
What happened?

15:10.410 --> 15:12.410
"Pomp and Circumstance"
sounded like "The Charleston!"

15:12.410 --> 15:14.410
Oh, well, I thought
it'd be quicker

15:14.410 --> 15:15.920
for the overall ceremony

15:15.920 --> 15:17.780
if we just saved that
for the end.

15:17.780 --> 15:20.840
CONNORS:
A little change
of our program.

15:20.840 --> 15:25.420
Now, to introduce, um,
a-a wonderful boy,

15:25.420 --> 15:27.930
who is going
to sing the school song,

15:27.930 --> 15:32.630
the star of our class musical,
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">Hell is a Poppin'{\r},</font></font></i>

15:32.630 --> 15:35.220
Mr. Warren Weber.

15:35.220 --> 15:37.220
(applause)

15:41.890 --> 15:44.390
(piano plays intro)

15:44.390 --> 15:46.980
(clears throat)

15:46.980 --> 15:49.480
(very quickly):

16:04.460 --> 16:06.720
(song ends)

16:06.720 --> 16:09.000
(applause)

16:11.670 --> 16:13.760
I told you
they were up to something.

16:13.760 --> 16:15.760
That song always
makes me cry,

16:15.760 --> 16:19.730
even that fast.

16:19.730 --> 16:21.310
Thank you Mr. Weber,

16:21.310 --> 16:24.270
for that most unusual rendition
of our school song.

16:24.270 --> 16:25.230
I got it!

16:30.360 --> 16:32.440
It-It... It came out.

16:33.940 --> 16:37.450
Sir, I have a lovely shot
of the back of your head.

16:37.450 --> 16:39.450
Would you like it?

16:42.120 --> 16:45.700
Parents, please
try to control yourselves

16:45.700 --> 16:47.620
just for a little while.

16:47.620 --> 16:50.210
And now, to announce
the winners

16:50.210 --> 16:52.850
of our various
class awards,

16:52.850 --> 16:56.800
in his own witty way,
Ralph Malph.

16:56.800 --> 16:59.100
(applause)

16:59.100 --> 17:02.520
Uh, I'm really delighted
to be here, folks.

17:02.520 --> 17:03.610
(Richie clears throat)

17:03.610 --> 17:05.440
RALPH:
Oh, yeah, okay.

17:05.440 --> 17:06.530
Anyway, so he bit him.

17:06.530 --> 17:09.030
How the elephant got
in my pajamas, I'll never know.

17:09.030 --> 17:11.030
And the man says,
"I can't hear you.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.700
I got a banana in my ear."

17:12.700 --> 17:13.780
(Ralph laughs)

17:13.780 --> 17:14.780
So much for jokes,
so much for jokes.

17:14.780 --> 17:16.150
Okay, now,

17:16.150 --> 17:18.240
on to the winners
of the class awards.

17:18.240 --> 17:19.740
Thank you.

17:19.740 --> 17:22.740
The winner of, um,
the first award

17:22.740 --> 17:24.740
is the drama award,
Heather Warren.

17:24.740 --> 17:27.380
(applause)

17:27.380 --> 17:29.970
I just want to thank
all the little people...

17:29.970 --> 17:31.470
Too numerous
to mention.

17:31.470 --> 17:32.970
Thank you, Heather...

17:32.970 --> 17:36.470
Now, the award
for Most Congenial.

17:36.470 --> 17:38.970
Oh, we have a tie
between Sally Hightower

17:38.970 --> 17:40.980
and Debbie...
and Debbie Chafin.

17:40.980 --> 17:41.980
(applause)

17:42.480 --> 17:43.980
You... You go.
Oh, no,
you go first.

17:43.980 --> 17:45.480
Oh, please, I insist,
you go first...

17:45.980 --> 17:47.820
Settle this off
stage, will you?

17:47.820 --> 17:49.350
And that's it
for the awards.

17:49.350 --> 17:51.600
(applause and whistling)

17:53.570 --> 17:56.190
Hey, how would you like
a dozen roses, baby?

17:56.190 --> 17:57.940
JOANIE:
Get lost.

17:57.940 --> 18:00.530
Hey...

18:00.530 --> 18:02.500
And now,

18:02.500 --> 18:04.580
the valedictorian
of our graduating class,

18:04.580 --> 18:06.750
Mr. Richard Cunningham.

18:06.750 --> 18:09.670
(applause and whistling)

18:09.670 --> 18:11.260
What's happened?

18:11.260 --> 18:13.260
Why is everything
going so fast?

18:13.260 --> 18:15.540
Oh, you don't have
to thank me.

18:17.760 --> 18:22.720
Faculty, staff, parents
and graduating students,

18:22.720 --> 18:25.470
life is full
of challenges.

18:25.470 --> 18:28.560
Marriage, work, family.

18:28.560 --> 18:31.560
Serious, serious challenges.

18:31.560 --> 18:35.560
So, in closing,
I'd like to say good luck.

18:35.560 --> 18:37.480
(applause)

18:41.150 --> 18:43.740
It was wonderful,
wasn't it, Howard?

18:43.740 --> 18:45.210
Is he finished?

18:45.210 --> 18:47.290
Do you call
that a speech?

18:47.290 --> 18:49.240
Well, it was a little wordy,
so I cut it down.

18:49.240 --> 18:51.300
(clears throat)

18:51.300 --> 18:55.300
Ladies and gentlemen,
since we have some extra time,

18:55.300 --> 18:59.300
I would now like
to introduce the valedictorian

18:59.300 --> 19:02.310
of our night school,
Mr. Arthur Fonzarelli.

19:02.310 --> 19:04.230
(applause and cheering)

19:19.860 --> 19:23.360
Thank you, Richard,
my very good friend.

19:23.360 --> 19:25.860
Thank you my fellow graduates

19:25.860 --> 19:29.120
and petition signers.

19:31.200 --> 19:33.290
You know,
some of you may be wondering,

19:33.290 --> 19:35.290
"What is Fonzie doing here?"

19:35.290 --> 19:37.290
Well, I'll tell you,
three years ago,

19:37.290 --> 19:39.180
I was wondering
the same thing myself.

19:39.180 --> 19:42.260
Oh, yeah, I want to tell you,
school was no fun.

19:42.260 --> 19:44.220
No.

19:44.220 --> 19:46.270
There were always a lot
of rules.

19:46.270 --> 19:47.770
You know, like, uh,

19:47.770 --> 19:49.690
(squeaky voice):
"Don't wear your taps
on your shoes."

19:51.360 --> 19:54.030
(stern voice):
"Don't ride your bike
up and down the hallway."

19:54.030 --> 19:57.110
I thought to myself,
"Who needs this?"

19:57.110 --> 19:58.650
You know?

19:58.650 --> 20:00.730
And instantaneously,
I dropped out.

20:00.730 --> 20:02.700
Kids thought I was cool.

20:04.490 --> 20:06.070
But I'm here to tell you

20:06.070 --> 20:09.910
that quitting things
is definitely not cool-amundo.

20:11.660 --> 20:13.250
This may surprise you, but some

20:13.250 --> 20:17.130
of the smartest people I know
have high school diplomas.

20:17.130 --> 20:19.220
(Arnold cackles)

20:21.720 --> 20:23.970
Thank you, Arnold.

20:23.970 --> 20:26.060
Let me... let me
tell you something, folks.

20:26.060 --> 20:27.060
Let me tell you something.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.560
Finishing school gives you
a sense of accomplishment.

20:29.560 --> 20:31.060
Can you dig it?

20:31.060 --> 20:33.570
It gives you a sense
of thumbs up for the future.

20:33.570 --> 20:36.570
I mean, that's why
I went back to night school.

20:36.570 --> 20:38.570
That's why I stand here tonight
before you

20:38.570 --> 20:41.660
wearing a dress.

20:41.660 --> 20:44.080
Yeah.

20:44.080 --> 20:46.160
I got one thing to say
in closing.

20:46.160 --> 20:47.660
Get your education.

20:47.660 --> 20:50.170
Get it during the day,
or get it at night,

20:50.170 --> 20:52.670
get it in between dates,
but get it.

20:52.670 --> 20:54.170
'Cause I want
to tell you something--

20:54.170 --> 20:55.670
staying in school is cool.

20:55.670 --> 20:58.090
Whoa!

20:58.090 --> 21:00.180
(cheering)

21:20.150 --> 21:22.650
Fonz, this
is a present

21:22.650 --> 21:24.650
from the entire
senior class.

21:25.150 --> 21:26.650
Yeah, well,
let me tell you something.

21:26.650 --> 21:28.650
I love it.

21:33.290 --> 21:35.880
Now we're two minutes
ahead of schedule.

21:35.880 --> 21:37.380
Oh, I... I'll bail you out.

21:37.380 --> 21:38.550
I'll finish my speech.

21:38.550 --> 21:40.630
(clears throat)

21:42.220 --> 21:45.300
As we are nearing the end
of the 1950s,

21:45.300 --> 21:47.220
we must realize

21:47.220 --> 21:50.810
that we graduates
are the leaders of the future.

21:51.260 --> 21:53.810
We must always keep in mind

21:53.810 --> 21:57.820
that our nation has survived
many scandals.

21:57.820 --> 22:01.320
The impeachment
of President Andrew Johnson,

22:01.320 --> 22:03.820
the assassinations

22:03.820 --> 22:07.330
of Presidents McKinley
and Lincoln.

22:07.330 --> 22:10.330
We don't know
what the future holds,

22:10.330 --> 22:12.330
but we do know

22:12.330 --> 22:15.700
that our nation
and our people will endure.

22:32.850 --> 22:35.440
("Pomp and Circumstance"
playing)
Mickey Wheatley.

22:35.440 --> 22:37.390

22:38.940 --> 22:41.190

22:41.190 --> 22:43.200

22:53.820 --> 22:55.820
(applause)

22:57.960 --> 23:00.050
Debbie Chafin.

23:00.050 --> 23:03.500
(applause)

23:03.500 --> 23:05.080
Hilary Moran.
Let me
tell you something.

23:05.080 --> 23:08.090
If he don't call my name,
I am leaving, and that's it.

23:08.090 --> 23:09.590
No, no, don't
go, Fonz, please.

23:09.590 --> 23:12.090
I cannot go down that aisle
without a diploma.

23:12.090 --> 23:13.590
Now, look, when
the time comes,

23:13.590 --> 23:14.590
just snap your
fingers, okay?

23:15.090 --> 23:16.600
What are you talking about?

23:16.600 --> 23:18.100
Just trust me,
Fonz, please.

23:18.100 --> 23:20.600
CONNORS:
Warren Weber.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.650

Ralph Malph.

23:26.150 --> 23:27.660
(applause)

23:30.660 --> 23:33.660
And now, our class
valedictorian,

23:33.660 --> 23:36.530
Richard Cunningham.

23:36.530 --> 23:39.000
(applause)

23:51.210 --> 23:53.300
I do not announce
the night school.

23:53.800 --> 23:57.300
Oh, Connors,
for heaven's sake!

23:57.300 --> 23:59.810
The night school class consists
of one graduate--

23:59.810 --> 24:01.610
Arthur Fonzarelli.

24:01.610 --> 24:03.690
(applause and cheering)

24:23.380 --> 24:25.960
On behalf of the United
States Post Office,

24:25.960 --> 24:28.470
here's your high
school diploma.
