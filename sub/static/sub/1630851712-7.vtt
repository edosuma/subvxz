00:49.340 --> 00:51.551
-Let's take a listen, Floyd.

00:51.634 --> 00:54.679
Hi. Doctor Pandy
was just giving Floyd a little checkup.

00:54.763 --> 00:58.183
He's got a cold,
so we're taking special care of him.

00:58.266 --> 00:59.851
Isn't that right, Floyd?

01:00.435 --> 01:04.064
And I'm tucking him in
with his favorite blanket.

01:04.731 --> 01:05.732
Cozy.

01:07.108 --> 01:10.445
And giving him
his favorite little Lovie Mouse.

01:10.528 --> 01:13.656
There you go, Floyd.
This will fix you right up.

01:15.200 --> 01:18.787
Doctor Pandy says
with a little rest and some snuggles,

01:18.870 --> 01:21.081
you'll be back
to your old self in no time.

01:21.164 --> 01:23.958
-Hey, did you hear that?

01:24.042 --> 01:26.961
It was a Dollhouse Delivery!
Come on, let's go see what it is.

01:27.504 --> 01:28.880
Feel better, Floyd.

01:40.308 --> 01:43.144
Let's see
what's in our Meow Meow Mailbox today.

01:43.937 --> 01:44.854
All right.

01:46.397 --> 01:47.482
Whoa!

01:49.067 --> 01:50.318
Look at this!

01:50.944 --> 01:54.697
It's covered in little bandages,
and there's a stethoscope,

01:54.781 --> 01:56.449
just like Doctor Pandy's.

01:57.033 --> 02:00.495
Hmm. Maybe someone in the Dollhouse
is not feeling too well.

02:00.578 --> 02:02.038
I don't know. Let's see.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.459
OK.

02:06.543 --> 02:07.669
There's…

02:08.336 --> 02:10.964
a little, tiny bowl.

02:11.047 --> 02:12.423
How cute!

02:12.507 --> 02:15.343
It has a little kitty face
on the side. See?

02:16.427 --> 02:18.805
Oh. And a spoon to go with the bowl.

02:20.056 --> 02:21.641
So tiny!

02:22.350 --> 02:23.601
What's this?

02:23.685 --> 02:26.229
Oh, it's a little soup container.

02:26.312 --> 02:28.439
And wait, I know what this is.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.608
This is dandelion soup.

02:30.692 --> 02:33.820
That's what Kitty Fairy likes to have
when she's not feeling well.

02:34.445 --> 02:35.572
Wait a minute.

02:35.655 --> 02:38.074
Do you think that Kitty Fairy's sick?

02:39.409 --> 02:41.911
We better get in the Dollhouse
and check up on her.

02:41.995 --> 02:45.748
Hey, do you want to come in the Dollhouse
and help us take care of Kitty Fairy?

02:46.291 --> 02:47.292
Great.

02:47.375 --> 02:53.590
Now all we have to do
is put this little soup container

02:53.673 --> 02:55.842
and the bowl in my backpack.

02:56.509 --> 02:58.511
And we're ready.

02:59.846 --> 03:01.264
Time to get tiny.

03:10.398 --> 03:11.941
Whee!

03:12.025 --> 03:14.569
I'm in the Fairy Tail Garden. Come on in!

03:16.821 --> 03:18.573
Welcome to my Dollhouse.

03:19.157 --> 03:21.951
OK, Pandy, let's go see Kitty Fairy.

03:22.994 --> 03:24.996
Pandy? Hmm.

03:25.538 --> 03:26.831
Do you see Pandy?

03:29.292 --> 03:31.336
Hug attack!

03:33.630 --> 03:35.965
Pandy. You got me again.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.967
I've had lots of practice.

03:38.885 --> 03:41.387
-Ah-ah… Achoo!
-Huh?

03:41.471 --> 03:43.223
That sounds like Kitty Fairy.

03:43.890 --> 03:44.891
Come on.

03:48.061 --> 03:48.895
Achoo!

03:49.562 --> 03:51.105
Oh, Kitty Fairy!

03:51.189 --> 03:52.398
Oh, hey, Gabby.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.817
Hey… Achoo! …Pandy.

03:54.901 --> 03:58.029
Aww! You sound really sneezy and snuffy.

03:58.112 --> 04:00.865
Yeah. You should be in bed, resting.

04:00.949 --> 04:05.036
Oh, no. I can't rest.
I'm not the only one who's sick.

04:05.119 --> 04:07.497
The Singing Flowers have sore throats,

04:07.580 --> 04:09.916
the Rainbow Kitty Tree has lost its color,

04:09.999 --> 04:13.670
and the Itty Bitty Blossoms are fussy
and need to be rocked to sleep.

04:13.753 --> 04:15.296
They all need me.

04:15.380 --> 04:16.798
Don't you worry.

04:16.881 --> 04:18.049
Help is here.

04:18.132 --> 04:21.427
We're gonna take care of everything,
so let's get you into bed.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.554
Oh, no. I can't.

04:23.638 --> 04:27.225
It's my responsibility
to take care of everyone.

04:27.308 --> 04:29.143
Ah-achoo!

04:29.227 --> 04:32.105
Achoo! Achoo! Achoo! Achoo!

04:32.188 --> 04:33.648
-Achoo! Achoo!
-Uh-oh!

04:33.731 --> 04:35.900
-Whoa!
-Achoo! Achoo! Achoo!

04:35.984 --> 04:39.362
-Meowzers! It's a sneeze-a-thon!
-Achoo! Achoo!

04:39.445 --> 04:41.406
-Hold on. I've got you.
-Achoo!

04:42.532 --> 04:43.700
-Achoo!

04:44.951 --> 04:46.119
-Gotcha!

04:46.953 --> 04:47.787
Ah…

04:48.454 --> 04:49.998
Oh, thank you, Pandy.

04:52.041 --> 04:53.710
Phew! No problem.

04:53.793 --> 04:56.087
Maybe I should lie down.

04:56.170 --> 04:58.881
Are you sure
you can take care of everyone?

04:58.965 --> 05:01.801
It's all easy-peasy, mac-and-cheesy.

05:01.884 --> 05:03.136
We've got this.

05:09.142 --> 05:09.976
Here.

05:10.059 --> 05:12.645
You have some warm dandelion soup…

05:13.855 --> 05:15.690
and go rest in your bed.

05:16.858 --> 05:18.943
Mm! So yummy!

05:19.027 --> 05:20.903
Thank you both so much.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.699
Does anyone else hear that whistle?

05:24.782 --> 05:27.285
-Yeah. What is that?

05:27.368 --> 05:29.412
That means someone needs my help.

05:29.495 --> 05:31.331
-It does?
-Yep.

05:31.414 --> 05:34.917
I gave each of my sick garden friends
a different instrument,

05:35.001 --> 05:36.711
so whenever they need something

05:36.794 --> 05:40.214
they can play their instrument
and I'll know who needs my help.

05:40.298 --> 05:43.926
The whistle means
the Singing Flowers are calling for me.

05:45.136 --> 05:46.137
Achoo!

05:46.220 --> 05:49.390
Uh-uh-uh. You get into bed and rest.

05:55.980 --> 05:59.484
Pandy and I will borrow your chart
and take care of everything.

05:59.567 --> 06:01.235
Aww. Thank you both.

06:01.319 --> 06:04.697
Yeah, don't worry.
The garden is in good hands.

06:05.239 --> 06:06.866
And paws.

06:09.410 --> 06:10.578
OK.

06:10.661 --> 06:13.539
So, the Singing Flowers have sore throats.

06:15.333 --> 06:16.918
Another instrument?

06:17.001 --> 06:19.587
Let's not panic, Pandy.
Let's check the chart.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.508
Did that sound like a whistle,

06:23.591 --> 06:24.884
a tambourine,

06:24.967 --> 06:25.968
or a drum?

06:31.724 --> 06:33.351
A tambourine!

06:33.434 --> 06:34.977
That's the Rainbow Tree.

06:35.061 --> 06:38.773
So the Singing Flowers
and Rainbow Tree need us.

06:38.856 --> 06:43.027
I'll go take care of the Singing Flowers,
and you take care of the Rainbow Tree.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.737
Yeah! That will work.

06:47.490 --> 06:50.076
Uh-oh. Another instrument?

06:53.246 --> 06:55.164
That sounds like a drum.

06:55.248 --> 07:00.837
OK. So, the Itty Bitty Blossoms
need to be rocked to sleep.

07:00.920 --> 07:05.174
They all need our help,
at the same time? How?

07:05.258 --> 07:07.844
We need to ask for some help.

07:07.927 --> 07:11.347
But we told Kitty Fairy
we'd take care of everyone.

07:11.430 --> 07:14.517
It's OK to ask for help
when you need it, Pandy.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.645
Asking for help is like a superpower.

07:17.728 --> 07:21.023
Who are we gonna ask
to take care of the Itty Bitty Blossoms?

07:21.107 --> 07:22.608
Flying furballs!

07:23.860 --> 07:25.445
What's going on up here?

07:25.528 --> 07:28.281
CatRat! Thank goodness you're here.

07:28.364 --> 07:30.366
We have a sick garden to take care of,

07:30.450 --> 07:33.744
and we could really use your help
with the Itty Bitty Blossoms.

07:33.828 --> 07:37.540
If it will quiet this racket down, I'm in.

07:37.623 --> 07:40.293
Great!
They need someone to rock them to sleep.

07:41.335 --> 07:43.629
Rock the Itty Bitty Blossoms to sleep?

07:43.713 --> 07:46.757
Pfft! Easy-peasy! I'm on my way.

07:47.341 --> 07:48.509
So are we.

07:51.762 --> 07:53.264
Hey, Singing Flowers.

07:55.433 --> 07:59.729
Kitty Fairy says you have sore throats,
and I'm here to take care of you.

08:05.401 --> 08:06.694
Aww!

08:06.777 --> 08:08.988
Your voices sound all scratchy.

08:12.783 --> 08:15.203
I think you guys could use some water.

08:20.458 --> 08:23.169
There! Now you sound a little bit better.

08:23.252 --> 08:25.421
-Uh-oh.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.632
-There you go.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.384
-I'm coming.

08:30.468 --> 08:32.345
-Hold on!

08:35.181 --> 08:38.059
I need a new strategy. I can't keep up.

08:38.142 --> 08:40.102
I don't have enough hands.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.312
I need help.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.857
Asking for help is a superpower,

08:44.941 --> 08:47.985
and I know a Gabby Cat
who has a lot of hands.

08:48.069 --> 08:49.654
DJ Catnip!

08:51.280 --> 08:53.157
What's shaking, kitty cat?

08:53.241 --> 08:54.408
Hey, DJ.

08:54.492 --> 08:57.703
The Singing Flowers are sick
and I need your help.

08:57.787 --> 09:00.289
Hey, I'll be there
in two shakes of a maraca.

09:09.131 --> 09:11.050
DJ Catnip, on the scene.

09:11.133 --> 09:12.218
That was fast.

09:14.637 --> 09:18.641
Whoa! No offense,
but that is one scratchy groove.

09:18.724 --> 09:21.978
I've been trying to water them
to make their sore throats go away,

09:22.061 --> 09:23.938
but I can't keep up.

09:24.021 --> 09:26.023
I need some helping hands.

09:26.107 --> 09:28.150
Well, you called the right cat.

09:31.862 --> 09:34.073
-Ah!
-Ooh!

09:34.156 --> 09:36.200
-Ooh!
-Ah!

09:45.585 --> 09:47.128
We did it!

09:47.211 --> 09:48.838
Thanks, DJ Catnip.

09:48.921 --> 09:52.258
Hey, that's what friends are for.
Now, give me some paw.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.555
Keep on grooving, flowers.

10:03.936 --> 10:06.772
The Singing Flowers
get their voices back.

10:06.856 --> 10:07.940
Check.

10:08.024 --> 10:10.776
Let's go see how Pandy's doing
with the Rainbow Tree.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.361
Bye, Singing Flowers.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.159
Hey, Pandy.
How's the Rainbow Tree feeling?

10:18.242 --> 10:21.287
Well, I've been hugging him
for a long time…

10:22.204 --> 10:24.790
but it's not bringing his color back.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.083
Hmm.

10:26.167 --> 10:29.420
We've got to get you healthy
so you get your color back,

10:29.503 --> 10:30.630
like your sister.

10:31.881 --> 10:35.468
-What should we do?
-I don't know… yet!

10:35.551 --> 10:37.928
But I'm sure we can figure this out.

10:39.096 --> 10:43.100
Maybe we can use
the power of asking for help.

10:43.184 --> 10:44.518
Who should we call?

10:45.269 --> 10:48.356
Oh! MerCat has a lotion
or potion for everything.

10:48.439 --> 10:51.442
-Maybe she could help us.
-Great idea, Pandy.

10:55.237 --> 10:56.364
Hey, Gabby, Gabby.

10:56.447 --> 10:59.992
MerCat, we could really use your help
in the garden.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.327
I'll be right up.

11:02.953 --> 11:04.080
Yoo-hoo!

11:08.709 --> 11:11.379
I love popping bubbles.

11:11.462 --> 11:12.630
How can I help?

11:12.713 --> 11:14.882
Pale puka shells!

11:14.965 --> 11:17.802
This poor Rainbow Tree's
lost all his color.

11:17.885 --> 11:19.804
And we're supposed to help him get better.

11:19.887 --> 11:22.223
Do you think you could help us
bring his color back?

11:22.306 --> 11:24.558
Of course I can, with a little…

11:27.895 --> 11:31.607
We're gonna get this little fella's
rainbow back in no time.

11:34.068 --> 11:36.362
Let's start with some mermaid water.

11:40.241 --> 11:41.575
There.

11:41.659 --> 11:44.662
Now, I need three things from the garden.

11:44.745 --> 11:48.124
Something red,
something yellow, and something blue.

11:48.207 --> 11:50.334
Red, yellow, and blue?

11:50.418 --> 11:52.211
Let's go find something red.

11:54.380 --> 11:55.965
Do you see something red?

11:59.969 --> 12:02.555
Red strawberries! Thanks.

12:05.808 --> 12:07.435
Whoa! I want to try!

12:08.144 --> 12:09.854
I'm gonna find something yellow.

12:10.729 --> 12:12.106
-Yellow lemons!

12:14.942 --> 12:16.694
Mm!

12:16.777 --> 12:18.154
Meowzers!

12:18.237 --> 12:20.114
That's one sour lemon.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.078
We just need something blue.

12:30.040 --> 12:31.333
Blue blueberries.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.712
Mm!

12:39.133 --> 12:43.387
Now, all you need
is just a drop, like this.

12:55.691 --> 12:58.694
Meowzer! The yellow stripe came back.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.363
Ooh! Let me try the red.

13:10.873 --> 13:12.291
My turn! My turn!

13:15.419 --> 13:16.754
Now for the blue.

13:20.966 --> 13:22.676
Paw-esome!

13:22.760 --> 13:26.096
MerCat, that was meow-mazing!

13:26.180 --> 13:29.558
But little Rainbow Tree
is still missing the rest of his colors.

13:29.642 --> 13:30.851
Where do we get those?

13:30.935 --> 13:34.188
We've already got
all the colors we need.

13:34.271 --> 13:35.105
Follow me.

13:38.734 --> 13:40.319
With red, yellow and blue,

13:40.402 --> 13:43.030
you can make
all the colors of the rainbow.

13:43.113 --> 13:45.199
You can? How?

13:45.282 --> 13:49.453
Well, I'll show you,
with my "Mer-tastic Rainbow Song."

14:12.935 --> 14:15.479
Blue and yellow make green.

14:16.105 --> 14:17.940
I love spa science.

14:24.029 --> 14:25.573
Ready for some orange?

14:38.919 --> 14:42.590
Yellow and red make orange!
Are you kitten me?

14:42.673 --> 14:44.550
This is paw-esome!

14:51.557 --> 14:53.642
Only one more color to go.

14:53.726 --> 14:54.894
Purple!

15:08.699 --> 15:11.827
Whoa! Red and blue make purple.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.579
You got it!

15:24.340 --> 15:26.342
I'm glad you're feeling better, buddy.

15:27.885 --> 15:29.470
Thanks for helping us, MerCat.

15:29.553 --> 15:33.599
Oh, Gabby, you know whenever you need me,
I'm just a bubble away.

15:36.602 --> 15:37.728
Bye!

15:37.811 --> 15:38.896
-Bye!
-Bye, MerCat!

15:41.231 --> 15:43.901
The Rainbow Tree, all better.

15:43.984 --> 15:44.818
Check.

15:46.195 --> 15:47.696
-Don't cry!
-Uh-oh!

15:47.780 --> 15:51.283
Sounds like CatRat could use some help
with the Itty Bitty Blossoms.

15:51.367 --> 15:55.829
Shh-shh! No, don't cry.
Please don't cry. CatRat's got you.

15:58.332 --> 15:59.583
Oh, come on!

16:00.751 --> 16:02.419
CatRat, how's it going?

16:02.503 --> 16:03.712
Not good.

16:03.796 --> 16:07.633
Every time I get one to fall asleep,
the rest wake it up again.

16:11.303 --> 16:12.513
See?

16:12.596 --> 16:15.265
Maybe you need to rock them all
at the same time.

16:15.349 --> 16:18.477
How am I supposed to do that?
Look at them all!

16:18.560 --> 16:19.937
Let's think.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.021
Hmm.

16:26.235 --> 16:30.656
Maybe we could build something
to rock them all at the same time.

16:30.739 --> 16:34.243
Yeah. We can call Baby Box
and ask for help.

16:34.326 --> 16:36.328
That's a great idea, Pandy.

16:42.251 --> 16:43.252
Hey, Gabby.

16:43.335 --> 16:44.712
Hi, Baby Box.

16:44.795 --> 16:47.589
We're in the garden,
getting the Itty Bitty Blossoms to sleep,

16:47.673 --> 16:49.258
and we could really use your help.

16:49.341 --> 16:50.843
I'm on my way!

16:55.139 --> 16:56.765
Oh, my goodness!

16:56.849 --> 16:58.726
They won't stop crying!

16:58.809 --> 17:02.771
We need to build something to rock them
all to sleep at the same time.

17:02.855 --> 17:03.856
Can you help us?

17:03.939 --> 17:06.275
Of course.

17:07.818 --> 17:11.113
Everyone, grab some twigs and sticks.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.000
Ta-da!

17:23.083 --> 17:25.544
An Itty Bitty Blossom Rocker.

17:25.627 --> 17:27.546
Well, let's get to rocking.

17:28.839 --> 17:29.965
Here goes nothing.

17:42.186 --> 17:44.354
Phew. Ah.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.023
This is more like it.

17:46.565 --> 17:49.777
-Thanks, Baby Box.
-You're welcome.

17:49.860 --> 17:52.654
Thank you guys so much for your help.

17:52.738 --> 17:54.198
No problem.

17:54.281 --> 17:56.241
Yeah, we love helping!

17:56.325 --> 17:57.701
And building!

17:58.243 --> 18:01.914
Baby Box,
you really are an expert builder.

18:01.997 --> 18:05.042
That's because I've been practicing
for my whole life.

18:05.125 --> 18:06.919
Practice makes better.

18:07.002 --> 18:09.838
Whenever you need help,
just give us a whistle.

18:12.591 --> 18:14.343
Thanks. I'll do that.

18:14.426 --> 18:15.886
-Bye!
-Bye!

18:16.512 --> 18:18.055
Let's check the chart.

18:18.138 --> 18:21.058
Baby Blossoms, all better.

18:21.141 --> 18:21.975
Check!

18:22.059 --> 18:26.105
Hey, look!
We took care of all our garden friends.

18:26.647 --> 18:29.316
It's all easy-peasy, mac-and-cheesy.

18:29.900 --> 18:30.901
Paw bump!

18:32.111 --> 18:34.279
Hey, guys. How's everything going?

18:34.363 --> 18:35.697
Kitty Fairy!

18:35.781 --> 18:38.992
It's going great.
Everyone is feeling much better.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.369
How are you feeling?

18:40.452 --> 18:42.621
I feel flower-riffic!

18:42.704 --> 18:45.415
That dandelion soup
and some rest did the trick.

18:45.499 --> 18:47.251
Thank you both so much.

18:47.334 --> 18:48.544
You're welcome.

18:48.627 --> 18:51.088
We had some help from our friends, too.

18:51.171 --> 18:55.050
Yeah. DJ Catnip helped,
and MerCat and Baby Box.

18:55.134 --> 19:00.347
And, of course, CatRat was a huge help
getting the Itty Bitty Blossoms to sleep.

19:00.430 --> 19:02.307
-Aww!

19:04.184 --> 19:06.353
-Huh? What?

19:06.436 --> 19:08.564
That's a good Itty Bitty Blossom.

19:08.647 --> 19:10.607
Aww!

19:10.691 --> 19:13.318
Looks like CatRat
needed a little sleep, too.

19:13.861 --> 19:14.695
Phew!

19:14.778 --> 19:16.196
That was a lot of work,

19:16.280 --> 19:20.159
but Pandy and I never would have
gotten it done if we didn't ask for help.

19:20.242 --> 19:23.704
We're lucky
we have such great friends, like you.

19:24.454 --> 19:26.582
Are you ready for another surprise?

19:40.762 --> 19:42.806
It's me, Kitty Fairy!

21:35.002 --> 21:36.086
Mm!

22:04.197 --> 22:07.117
My garden is such a special place.

22:07.200 --> 22:09.494
I just love living in the garden.

22:11.955 --> 22:16.126
I'm so glad that Kitty Fairy is feeling
back to her flower-riffic self.

22:16.209 --> 22:19.129
I think she was happy
that we helped take care of her garden.

22:19.755 --> 22:21.006
And you know what?

22:21.089 --> 22:24.301
I think that taking care
of Kitty Fairy and the garden

22:24.384 --> 22:26.345
made me feel really good, too.

22:27.596 --> 22:28.805
Thanks, Kitty Fairy.

22:29.431 --> 22:31.933
Oh! And you want to know
who else is feeling better?

22:32.559 --> 22:35.437
-Floyd! Aren't you, Floyd, huh?

22:36.021 --> 22:39.941
Come back next time and we'll open up
another Dollhouse Surprise.

22:40.025 --> 22:40.859
Bye!
