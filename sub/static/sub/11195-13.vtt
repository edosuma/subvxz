00:34.201 --> 00:36.745
- Dr Jordan.
- Steven.

00:36.828 --> 00:39.289
What are you doing here so late?

00:39.414 --> 00:41.792
I was just about to go down to the lab.

00:41.875 --> 00:45.295
We finally have a chance to do
a resonance scan on the Osiris jar.

00:45.379 --> 00:46.463
Great, great.

00:46.588 --> 00:50.676
Another couple of weeks and we never
would have known what was inside.

00:50.759 --> 00:54.096
Well, we could always break the seal
and take a look.

00:55.013 --> 00:57.766
Joking. Well, half-joking.

00:57.850 --> 00:59.184
(sighs)

00:59.268 --> 01:03.021
The Egyptian government expects
these items to be returned intact.

01:03.105 --> 01:06.859
- If we were in their place, I'm sure...
- Sir, the scan will reveal that...

01:06.984 --> 01:11.113
..that Canopic jar contains the mummified
heart of a 3,000-year-old Pharaoh,...

01:11.196 --> 01:14.449
- ..and we're just handing it over.
- I know. I know.

01:14.575 --> 01:17.744
It's the find of a lifetime, Professor.

01:17.870 --> 01:19.913
Yes.

01:20.664 --> 01:22.708
Yes, it is.

01:24.918 --> 01:28.755
- Are you coming?
- Yeah. I just have a few things...

01:28.881 --> 01:31.717
- I'll see you down there.
- All right.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.996
- Morning.
- (O'Neill) Hey.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.749
What's that?

02:03.832 --> 02:05.876
Um...

02:07.628 --> 02:10.005
Teal'c's into this stuff.

02:10.088 --> 02:12.299
I don't get it.

02:16.220 --> 02:19.389
"A great week is in store for you.
You'll be goin' on a trip."

02:19.515 --> 02:21.558
Let me see that.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.687
- OK.
- Oh, my God.

02:26.230 --> 02:28.690
- What?
- He's dead.

02:30.901 --> 02:35.113
- Who?
- My archaeology professor.

03:44.224 --> 03:48.770
Dr David Jordan was a teacher,
a celebrated author,...

03:49.605 --> 03:53.275
..a much revered expert
in the field of archaeology.

03:53.400 --> 03:58.530
And yet, to the end, he remained
first and foremost a student,...

03:59.364 --> 04:04.161
..guided by the simple desire
to discover and understand.

04:05.704 --> 04:09.791
It is fitting, then, that a man
who dedicated his life...

04:14.671 --> 04:20.052
..who dedicated his life
to reviving the wonders and majesty...

04:20.135 --> 04:25.098
..of long-dead civilisations should
himself gain a measure of immortality...

04:25.182 --> 04:27.851
..through that very accomplishment.

04:27.935 --> 04:31.104
I worked with Dr Jordan
for close to 15 years.

04:31.188 --> 04:33.732
He was like a father to me,...

04:33.857 --> 04:36.568
..through his many successes...

04:37.736 --> 04:41.406
..and... some of
his bitter disappointments.

04:47.454 --> 04:52.668
I'll remember him always as a...
dedicated archaeologist,...

04:53.710 --> 04:56.171
..a kind and generous man...

04:57.297 --> 04:59.758
..and a true friend.

05:25.534 --> 05:27.995
The prodigal son returns.

05:28.996 --> 05:31.373
Steven.

05:36.295 --> 05:38.005
Sarah.

05:38.130 --> 05:39.381
Daniel.

05:41.717 --> 05:44.636
It's good to see you.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.763
Yeah.

05:48.182 --> 05:51.101
- Despite the circumstances.
- I know.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.229
I still can't believe he's gone.

05:57.816 --> 06:01.069
So... what exactly happened?
I mean, uh...

06:01.195 --> 06:04.198
The paper attributed his death
to the curse of Osiris.

06:04.281 --> 06:09.494
According to the police...
there was a slow gas leak in the lab.

06:09.578 --> 06:14.791
Something caused a spark. The whole
place went up. He was killed instantly.

06:16.627 --> 06:20.297
We would have called you,
but nobody knew where to find you.

06:20.422 --> 06:22.799
That's, uh, that's OK.

06:23.675 --> 06:26.136
I'm glad you're here.

06:39.775 --> 06:44.029
So, how long's it been? Four years?

06:44.112 --> 06:46.073
Five.

06:46.198 --> 06:50.285
- What have you been up to?
- I've been busy.

06:50.369 --> 06:53.372
Really? I've looked for
signs of you out there.

06:53.497 --> 06:56.500
There's been no papers,
no research projects.

06:56.583 --> 07:00.087
- It's like you fell off the face of the earth.
- It is a little like that.

07:00.212 --> 07:05.759
As I recall, the last time I saw you, you
were giving a lecture to an empty room.

07:05.843 --> 07:09.263
- Well, it was full when I started.
- Maybe the world wasn't ready...

07:09.388 --> 07:12.808
..to hear that the pyramids
were built by aliens.

07:12.891 --> 07:14.685
- Steven, please.
- Yes, Steven, please.

07:14.768 --> 07:18.981
Why did you come? You managed
to stay away all this time.

07:19.064 --> 07:23.443
If you're looking for closure, Daniel,
I'd say you're a little late.

07:26.530 --> 07:28.991
Always a pleasure, Steven(!)

07:39.293 --> 07:43.213
- So are you doing anything, or...?
- No. I'm all yours.

07:48.218 --> 07:51.138
I'm sorry. He's not usually like this.

07:52.139 --> 07:55.142
The last couple of days
have been really hard on him.

07:55.267 --> 08:00.480
Steven? No, he's right. I should have
come back sooner. I guess I was...

08:00.606 --> 08:02.983
..afraid I wouldn't be welcome.

08:03.108 --> 08:06.278
Are you joking? Even after
everything that happened,...

08:06.403 --> 08:10.699
..Dr Jordan never thought any less of you.
You were his best student.

08:10.824 --> 08:14.578
Yes, that became the laughing stock
of the archaeological community.

08:14.703 --> 08:18.624
He kept hoping you'd find proof,
something to shut everyone up.

08:18.749 --> 08:20.959
No, he thought I was nuts.

08:21.043 --> 08:25.130
That's not true. Look, why do you think
it's so hard for Steven to see you here?

08:25.214 --> 08:29.384
He's always been in your shadow.
Even after you left.

08:29.468 --> 08:32.638
I hear his book's on the best-seller list.

08:32.721 --> 08:34.847
I know. He's getting a Porsche.

08:34.932 --> 08:36.975
- Ow!
- I know.

08:40.187 --> 08:44.983
Look, I have to admit, I thought
you didn't come back because of me.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.948
No, that's... that's not it.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.660
We could have ended it
better than we did.

08:55.994 --> 08:58.038
Maybe.

08:59.540 --> 09:03.710
The truth is, I got caught up
in something... incredible.

09:05.420 --> 09:10.133
You found something, didn't you?
That supports your theory? Tell me.

09:11.593 --> 09:12.845
- Come on.
- I can't.

09:12.970 --> 09:14.680
Daniel.

09:14.763 --> 09:17.766
OK. Let's just say...

09:17.850 --> 09:23.480
..that what the world knows about ancient
Egypt barely scratches the surface.

09:23.856 --> 09:27.901
The truth is more incredible
than any of us ever imagined.

09:28.944 --> 09:31.321
Now that's the Daniel I remember.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.992
Come on. I want to show you something.

09:38.412 --> 09:40.122
As you were.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.791
So, General, who's gettin'
assigned to SG-1?

09:42.916 --> 09:47.796
No one. I've decided to reschedule your
next mission until Dr Jackson returns.

09:47.880 --> 09:50.340
You're all long overdue
for some personal leave.

09:50.465 --> 09:53.468
Yes, sir. Well, the leaving part
has been the problem.

09:53.594 --> 09:58.974
I think you'll make it to the front door
before we realise we can't do without you.

09:59.057 --> 10:01.518
- Dismissed.
- Thank you, sir.

10:04.938 --> 10:09.651
Carter, you finally ready
to take me up on that fishing trip?

10:09.776 --> 10:12.237
Actually, sir, I have
a few projects on the go.

10:12.362 --> 10:15.115
Oh, come on. Are you really
trying to tell me...

10:15.199 --> 10:19.828
..you'd rather work in the dark, dank,
dismal underground than sit on a dock...

10:19.953 --> 10:23.040
..with your feet perched up,
sipping a cold one and...

10:23.123 --> 10:26.293
..casting for that ever-elusive crappie?

10:28.837 --> 10:32.174
Strange as it may sound, sir... yes.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.593
Have a good time.

10:35.427 --> 10:37.554
To each his own.

10:37.679 --> 10:40.140
Her. I meant her.

10:41.475 --> 10:43.519
I think.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.438
So Teal'c.

10:46.522 --> 10:50.901
This'll be great. Just you and me.
What do you say? Come on. The loons.

10:51.026 --> 10:53.487
Don't forget the loons.

10:56.073 --> 11:00.869
I thought you might like to see what
we were working on before the accident.

11:02.913 --> 11:04.540
Wow.

11:04.623 --> 11:09.086
- This stuff is incredible.
- I only wish we had more time with them.

11:09.211 --> 11:11.755
The Egyptians have
requested their return.

11:11.880 --> 11:16.176
We've been desperately trying to learn
as much as we can before the deadline.

11:17.010 --> 11:20.264
"Woe to all who disturb this,
my final resting place."

11:20.347 --> 11:25.143
Careful now. All these artefacts
are cursed. Well, that's what they say.

11:26.478 --> 11:28.522
Yeah, I read something like that.

11:28.647 --> 11:33.026
Every member of the original expedition
in 1931 died within a year of the dig.

11:33.151 --> 11:37.865
The ship transporting these artefacts to
America sank off the coast of New Jersey.

11:37.990 --> 11:40.909
- The Stewart expedition.
- Yes.

11:40.993 --> 11:45.122
Those deaths were attributed to mould
spores when they unsealed the chamber.

11:45.205 --> 11:48.458
Mould spores aren't
exactly front-page material.

11:48.542 --> 11:50.669
No, I guess not.

11:51.336 --> 11:55.007
If these things went down with the ship
in 1931 , how did they wind up here?

11:55.090 --> 12:00.053
They found the wreck a few months ago.
The artefacts were in their packing crates.

12:00.137 --> 12:03.140
They brought it up
and they shipped them to the museum.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.267
We just got them last week.

12:05.392 --> 12:10.355
I can stay for a couple more days
if you need some help cataloguing these.

12:16.111 --> 12:19.031
- What?
- Something's missing.

12:19.114 --> 12:22.034
- Are you sure?
- Positive. A gold amulet.

12:22.993 --> 12:25.454
Daniel, I've got to find it.

12:26.413 --> 12:31.460
Just so we're clear on this, sir, it's gonna
be me, Teal'c and the great outdoors.

12:31.543 --> 12:36.840
That means no cellphones, fax machines,
not another living soul for miles.

12:36.924 --> 12:39.718
We'll be unavailable, inaccessible.

12:39.801 --> 12:42.179
- Incommunicado.
- Minnesota, sir.

12:42.304 --> 12:45.474
- I stand corrected.
- If there's an emergency at the base,...

12:45.557 --> 12:48.268
..better plan ahead and tell me now.

12:48.352 --> 12:53.065
If Thor needs me, he's gonna have to
beam me up. If the Tok'ra... forget it.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.991
Excuse the state of things. Budget cuts.

13:03.075 --> 13:05.702
I'm straightening the mess out,
but it takes time.

13:05.786 --> 13:08.747
- I understand.
- So what am I looking for?

13:08.831 --> 13:13.001
- An artefact from the Stewart expedition.
- The lsis jar.

13:13.085 --> 13:18.590
No, actually. I'm, uh, referring to
a gold amulet with a little ebony, um...

13:21.009 --> 13:22.886
It's listed as item 14C.

13:23.011 --> 13:26.014
That was sent to Dr Jordan
with the rest of the artefacts.

13:26.098 --> 13:28.141
- You sure?
- I sent 'em myself.

13:28.267 --> 13:31.436
- I can show you the paperwork.
- No. Um...

13:31.520 --> 13:34.606
What's this, uh, lsis jar
you were talking about?

13:34.731 --> 13:36.775
I'll show you.

13:38.944 --> 13:43.991
That crate was mislabelled when it came
in. I only found it a couple of days ago.

13:46.368 --> 13:48.829
- This one?
- Oh, yeah.

13:52.124 --> 13:55.544
(curator) I've never seen
those symbols before, have you?

13:55.627 --> 13:59.214
Yes. I'm gonna need to do a translation.

13:59.756 --> 14:05.262
Well, if you need me, I'll be in the back,
cataloguing the Polynesian death masks.

14:15.689 --> 14:17.733
(phone rings)

14:21.695 --> 14:23.488
- Carter.
- (Daniel) Sam, it's me.

14:23.614 --> 14:27.034
Hang on a sec.
Thanks for your help, Sergeant.

14:27.117 --> 14:29.161
Yeah, no sweat, Major.

14:30.120 --> 14:32.498
- Where are you?
- Still in Chicago.

14:32.581 --> 14:37.461
In the basement of a museum looking at
what appears to be an Egyptian burial jar.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.087
OK.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.508
Which may not seem out of
the ordinary in a museum,...

14:42.591 --> 14:46.428
..but there's something else
besides the usual hieroglyphs.

14:46.512 --> 14:49.056
There's a second set of markings.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.851
They're Goa'uld symbols.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.087
There appears to be no fish here, O'Neill.

15:22.256 --> 15:28.262
T... it's not about
the actual fish themselves.

15:28.971 --> 15:31.890
Fish are not important in this context.

15:32.850 --> 15:35.310
It's about fish-ing.

15:35.394 --> 15:38.480
The... act of fishing itself.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.442
- I see.
- (cellphone rings)

15:49.408 --> 15:51.869
You didn't?

15:51.952 --> 15:54.746
By request of General Hammond.

15:56.290 --> 15:58.333
No way.

16:03.755 --> 16:05.632
What?

16:05.924 --> 16:09.428
Yes, Daniel. He's right here. Please hold.

16:17.060 --> 16:19.104
Daniel Jackson.

16:21.732 --> 16:24.359
We have caught nothing. We are fishing.

16:25.235 --> 16:28.405
Right. Listen, I need
a little help with a translation.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.949
I've got a line here that reads...

16:31.074 --> 16:34.411
.."Hakoor kra terak shree."

16:38.248 --> 16:41.210
- Banished to oblivion.
- Right.

16:41.835 --> 16:44.129
OK. Thank you.

16:44.379 --> 16:48.300
If you require assistance, I would be
more than happy to return to the SGC.

16:48.383 --> 16:51.303
No, thanks. I think I can take it from here.

16:52.304 --> 16:54.765
- Are you certain?
- Give me that.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.730
- Goodbye, Daniel.
- No, wait...

17:24.086 --> 17:28.089
The ancient Egyptians would remove
the vital organs of the deceased...

17:28.173 --> 17:31.677
..and place them in jars, which
were buried with the sarcophagus...

17:31.802 --> 17:34.429
..so they could be accessed
in the afterlife.

17:34.513 --> 17:38.976
- Is that what we're looking at here?
- The record of the expedition says...

17:39.059 --> 17:43.438
..no sarcophagus was found.
The hieroglyphs identify the jar...

17:43.522 --> 17:47.526
..as belonging to lsis,
who is the Egyptian mother goddess.

17:47.609 --> 17:49.403
- A Goa'uld?
- It's possible.

17:49.486 --> 17:53.532
Isis was the consort of Osiris,
supposedly the first Pharaoh of Egypt.

17:53.615 --> 17:56.577
Now, according to legend,
he was placed in a magic box...

17:56.660 --> 17:59.621
..and dumped into the Nile
by his brother Seth.

17:59.705 --> 18:03.125
- Now that name I recognise.
- The Goa'uld symbols indicate...

18:03.250 --> 18:08.213
..that lsis and Osiris suffered
some sort of punishment or banishment.

18:09.006 --> 18:11.884
- Where to?
- I have no idea.

18:13.385 --> 18:16.221
- Major, I want the contents analysed.
- Yes, sir.

18:16.305 --> 18:20.225
I'd be careful if I were you. It could be
some sort of Goa'uld booby trap...

18:20.309 --> 18:23.562
..left behind by Osiris
as a means of revenge.

18:23.645 --> 18:27.399
Also it's, uh... it's cursed.

18:29.693 --> 18:32.237
Thanks for the warning.

18:35.324 --> 18:38.035
General, there's something else.

18:39.328 --> 18:43.624
The inventory of the
Stewart expedition lists two jars.

18:43.707 --> 18:46.084
- Can you find the other one?
- Well, I can try.

18:46.210 --> 18:48.962
I was gonna head back
to Chicago tonight.

18:59.765 --> 19:01.808
Hello?

19:04.186 --> 19:05.812
Hello?

19:50.357 --> 19:52.818
- Do you mind?
- What are you doing here?

19:53.068 --> 19:55.821
- What are you doing here?
- I asked first.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.074
I work here, Daniel. Remember?

19:59.199 --> 20:03.579
I'm looking for the breaker box,
wherever the damn thing is.

20:03.662 --> 20:05.706
Uh... Right. Um...

20:07.124 --> 20:10.794
- I had a few questions for the curator.
- I don't think she's here.

20:10.878 --> 20:15.007
The lights were out when I came in.
What did you wanna ask her about?

20:15.090 --> 20:18.177
I need information on items
from the Stewart expedition.

20:18.302 --> 20:20.846
There's something missing.

20:20.971 --> 20:23.432
There's nothing missing.

20:25.684 --> 20:26.935
Uh...

20:27.019 --> 20:31.648
A Canopic jar with some hieroglyphs
and some unusual markings.

20:31.773 --> 20:33.984
The Osiris jar.

20:34.109 --> 20:37.029
- Yes.
- Destroyed in the explosion.

20:37.487 --> 20:40.032
- Are you sure about that?
- Yes, positive.

20:40.115 --> 20:43.035
OK, well, what about this gold amulet?

20:43.785 --> 20:47.873
Daniel, if you're looking to get back
with Sarah, that's your business.

20:47.956 --> 20:51.460
I couldn't care less. But I do have
a problem with you coming here...

20:51.543 --> 20:54.379
..and involving yourself in my work.

20:55.631 --> 21:00.177
- Don't you mean Dr Jordan's work?
- No. Sarah and I were his assistants.

21:00.302 --> 21:03.138
You haven't been involved
since you walked out on him.

21:03.222 --> 21:06.808
I didn't walk out on him.
I was trying to protect him.

21:06.934 --> 21:10.854
You mean you distanced yourself
in order to spare him embarrassment.

21:10.979 --> 21:14.316
Daniel, you really
should not have come back.

21:17.277 --> 21:22.699
Look, I don't wanna get into this with you
right now, but you need my help.

21:22.783 --> 21:25.619
Why? You think there might
be aliens involved?

21:30.749 --> 21:32.793
Oh, God.

21:40.133 --> 21:44.680
Preliminary analysis of the jar indicates
the exterior is ordinary ceramic.

21:44.763 --> 21:47.391
It also appears as if
the seal has been damaged.

21:47.474 --> 21:49.852
Any indication of what might be inside?

21:49.935 --> 21:54.231
Well, hopefully a computer-enhanced
MRI will tell us something.

21:55.899 --> 21:58.360
Is that what I think it is?

21:58.443 --> 22:00.904
Yes, sir. It's a Goa'uld symbiote.

22:08.829 --> 22:13.709
The police said that the museum curator
suffered a fatal blunt trauma to the skull.

22:13.792 --> 22:18.255
- They don't think that you had any...?
- No, but Steven didn't do anything...

22:18.338 --> 22:23.552
..to dissuade them from suspecting me,
but fortunately I know a few... people.

22:25.012 --> 22:28.432
They found some bricks at
the bottom of the elevator shaft,...

22:28.515 --> 22:34.855
..and they think that they came from
the wall above and... a freak accident.

22:34.938 --> 22:39.484
You know, the papers are saying
the curse of the mummy strikes again.

22:41.028 --> 22:45.407
Do you have any pictures of the Osiris jar,
the one destroyed in the explosion?

22:45.491 --> 22:47.534
Yeah. Here.

22:56.710 --> 23:00.547
- I can't make out the inscription.
- We were unable to identify the symbols.

23:00.631 --> 23:04.134
But Dr Jordan copied them
in his notebook.

23:07.387 --> 23:10.474
Those markings are unlike
anything we've ever seen before.

23:10.599 --> 23:14.436
- They're not Egyptian.
- No, they're not Egyptian.

23:15.145 --> 23:17.439
So what are they?

23:18.232 --> 23:20.609
What are they?

23:20.734 --> 23:22.778
You know. How?

23:23.737 --> 23:27.407
Let's just say I can't go into it right now,
but this is very important.

23:27.491 --> 23:30.577
Did Dr Jordan do any kind
of preliminary tests on the jar?

23:30.661 --> 23:34.873
Not that I know of, but he kept
all his lab results on the computer.

24:06.947 --> 24:09.658
It's dead. We can relax.

24:23.297 --> 24:26.049
Do we know how long
it's been inside the jar?

24:26.133 --> 24:29.636
According to Daniel,
several thousand years.

24:30.929 --> 24:33.640
Well, it's perfectly preserved.

24:35.893 --> 24:39.062
It could've died yesterday.

24:44.359 --> 24:46.987
Something's wrong.

24:47.070 --> 24:49.364
- What?
- Dr Jordan's files are gone.

24:51.325 --> 24:53.785
Everything's been wiped clean.

24:55.662 --> 24:57.873
Including his e-mail account.

24:58.499 --> 25:00.709
Do you keep backups?

25:01.418 --> 25:03.712
Yeah. They're not here.

25:07.549 --> 25:08.800
What are you doing?

25:08.884 --> 25:12.554
The system marks file space
that's been deleted as "tombstone".

25:12.638 --> 25:15.807
It scours the database
looking for tombstone values...

25:15.891 --> 25:18.352
..and marks them as
ready to be overwritten.

25:18.435 --> 25:21.438
There's usually about 30 days
before that happens,...

25:21.522 --> 25:27.444
..so I might be able to retrieve the files
before the tombstone values replicate.

25:30.197 --> 25:35.410
Got something. The professor received
one message on the night he died.

25:35.494 --> 25:38.580
I'm guessing he never
got round to reading it.

25:40.249 --> 25:44.795
That's the results of the carbon-dating
analysis on the ebony portion of item 14C.

25:44.878 --> 25:47.005
The missing gold amulet.

25:47.089 --> 25:51.009
Oh, my God. Daniel,
it's over 10,000 years old.

25:52.302 --> 25:55.013
This means you were right all along.

25:55.097 --> 25:57.057
Yeah, I know.

25:57.140 --> 26:00.727
Egyptian civilisation must be thousands
of years older than we assumed.

26:00.853 --> 26:05.399
- Sarah, you can't... tell anyone about this.
- What are you talking about?

26:05.482 --> 26:09.778
This is exactly the evidence you've been
looking for. It validates your theories.

26:09.862 --> 26:14.116
All we've got is one carbon-dating
analysis on a missing artefact.

26:14.199 --> 26:18.745
So we can contact the technician
who performed the analysis.

26:22.499 --> 26:24.126
What?

26:24.251 --> 26:27.921
Dr Jordan wasn't the only one
to get these results.

26:33.051 --> 26:35.095
Steven.

26:38.932 --> 26:42.102
That Goa'uld symbiote
should be a desiccated husk,...

26:42.227 --> 26:44.521
..but instead it's in perfect condition.

26:44.646 --> 26:47.900
At first we thought it had been
preserved in formaldehyde,...

26:47.983 --> 26:50.444
- ..but now we are not so sure.
- What do you mean?

26:50.527 --> 26:52.571
The outside of the jar is ceramic,...

26:52.696 --> 26:56.200
..but the inside is a technologically
advanced containment vessel.

26:56.325 --> 27:00.537
There's a tiny naqahdah power source
designed to emit a low-level charge.

27:00.621 --> 27:02.664
- Why?
- We can't be certain yet, sir,...

27:02.789 --> 27:05.501
..but I guess the jar
is some sort of stasis chamber.

27:05.584 --> 27:09.963
We think that the symbiote was alive
when it was placed inside.

27:10.631 --> 27:14.718
Why would it allow itself to be removed
from its host and placed in stasis?

27:14.801 --> 27:16.762
I don't believe it had a choice, sir.

27:16.887 --> 27:20.224
The liquid inside the jar
seems to have sedative properties.

27:20.349 --> 27:25.062
If maintained at the proper temperature
and provided with sufficient charge,...

27:25.145 --> 27:28.065
..it could probably keep
a symbiote alive indefinitely.

27:28.148 --> 27:31.318
- Then why is it dead?
- The seal was broken.

27:31.443 --> 27:33.820
Presumably during transport.

27:33.904 --> 27:38.033
If what you're saying is true and
a second jar survived the trip unscathed...

27:38.116 --> 27:41.620
Yes, sir. There could be
a Goa'uld out there.

27:59.388 --> 28:01.431
(Sarah) Daniel?

28:02.182 --> 28:04.726
There you are.
I've been looking all over for you.

28:04.810 --> 28:09.189
- I was doing a little extra research.
- I went by Steven's place and he's gone.

28:09.273 --> 28:12.860
- He's just packed up everything and left.
- I know.

28:13.402 --> 28:16.572
- You think he stole the amulet, don't you?
- Yes.

28:16.697 --> 28:19.575
To stop your theories
from being proven correct?

28:19.658 --> 28:22.202
It's possible. Anyway, I have to find him.

28:22.327 --> 28:26.415
- Well, I'll come with you.
- No. No, it's too dangerous.

28:27.166 --> 28:30.169
We're talking about Steven here.

28:30.252 --> 28:32.963
Sarah, there have been
three deaths already.

28:33.046 --> 28:34.298
Three?

28:34.381 --> 28:39.678
They found the body of the technician
who did the carbon dating on the amulet.

28:39.761 --> 28:42.764
Daniel, I know Steven.

28:42.890 --> 28:45.976
He may be capable of a lot of things,
but he's no murderer.

28:46.101 --> 28:50.898
Well, you may not know him as well as
you think you do. At least... not any more.

28:51.607 --> 28:54.067
What's that supposed to mean?

28:56.153 --> 29:00.073
Let me guess - you can't explain, right?
Well, what do you expect, Daniel?

29:00.157 --> 29:03.577
You show up after five years
but you can't say where you've been.

29:03.702 --> 29:08.081
You've got this ability to read an ancient
language which nobody's seen before,...

29:08.207 --> 29:10.250
..but you can't explain how.

29:10.375 --> 29:12.836
And when we find evidence
to vindicate you...

29:12.920 --> 29:17.216
..in front of the entire archaeological
community, you want to cover it up.

29:17.341 --> 29:19.801
What is going on?

29:24.306 --> 29:26.767
- This is me, Daniel.
- I know.

29:29.561 --> 29:35.567
Then why can't you trust me? What have
you been doing for the past five years?

29:35.651 --> 29:38.445
I wanna tell you, Sarah.

29:38.529 --> 29:40.989
I do. Believe me.

29:42.157 --> 29:45.661
I wish you could see
some of the things I've seen.

29:47.454 --> 29:50.165
But the world's not ready to know.

29:51.416 --> 29:54.211
Not yet.

29:54.294 --> 29:57.297
I'm not asking you to tell the world.

29:57.422 --> 30:00.092
I'm asking you to tell me.

30:00.759 --> 30:02.970
This is my life's work too, Daniel.

30:05.013 --> 30:08.350
So you're working for the government.
What? Daniel!

30:08.433 --> 30:10.644
I'm sorry.

30:11.937 --> 30:15.190
You're just going to
disappear again, aren't you?

30:15.315 --> 30:17.526
Yes.

30:18.569 --> 30:23.031
I think Steven was right.
You never should have come back.

30:36.420 --> 30:39.673
You believe this Steven Rayner
has been taken over by a Goa'uld?

30:39.756 --> 30:42.926
- Well, it makes sense.
- So how do we find him?

30:43.051 --> 30:47.931
Right now this is our only lead. It's
the amulet stolen from Dr Jordan's office.

30:48.056 --> 30:51.727
It's a priceless relic, but I'm assuming
a Goa'uld isn't interested...

30:51.852 --> 30:53.979
..in its monetary value.

30:54.104 --> 30:56.565
- Then why take it?
- That's a good question.

30:56.690 --> 31:01.320
It's a standard representation of Osiris.
He's carrying a crook and flail.

31:01.403 --> 31:05.657
In the centre is an ankh, which is
the Egyptian symbol for immortality.

31:05.741 --> 31:10.037
- Could it be some sort of Goa'uld device?
- It's possible.

31:10.120 --> 31:12.498
That might explain
why it was the only item taken.

31:12.623 --> 31:15.292
I checked the other
artefacts for naqahdah,...

31:15.375 --> 31:19.755
..which is usually a sure sign of Goa'uld
technology, and I came up empty.

31:19.838 --> 31:22.466
Assuming this Goa'uld is Osiris,
what does he want?

31:22.549 --> 31:27.012
He's been out of the loop. He doesn't
know what happened to Seth or Ra.

31:27.137 --> 31:30.015
He could be looking for the lsis jar.

31:30.098 --> 31:35.145
- Or a way off the planet.
- I've already put the base on alert.

31:41.151 --> 31:43.695
I managed to synthesise
the liquid from the jar.

31:43.821 --> 31:46.281
On its own it should act
as a powerful sedative.

31:46.365 --> 31:49.785
One dart should be more than enough
to knock out an adult Goa'uld.

31:49.868 --> 31:53.789
- Do we really want this thing alive?
- Even though it's been in stasis,...

31:53.914 --> 31:56.375
..it could be a valuable
source of information.

31:56.458 --> 31:59.628
Hold that in reserve.
Your priority is to stop the Goa'uld...

31:59.753 --> 32:03.507
- ..with minimum risk to yourself.
- (phone rings)

32:05.092 --> 32:06.635
Fraiser.

32:06.718 --> 32:08.762
Yes, he's right here. Sir.

32:11.056 --> 32:13.016
Hammond.

32:13.392 --> 32:15.769
Yes.

32:16.311 --> 32:18.772
All right. Thank you.

32:19.356 --> 32:22.943
We got a lead on Steven Rayner.
He boarded a flight to Cairo.

32:23.068 --> 32:27.239
Back to the temple where the jars were
discovered. We could head him off, sir.

32:27.322 --> 32:31.076
I can alert the Egyptian authorities,
but this needs to be low profile.

32:31.160 --> 32:33.453
Dr Fraiser will accompany you.

33:11.992 --> 33:16.288
I think I know why this place
doesn't get any tourists.

33:16.413 --> 33:20.584
According to the GPS,
we've still got another ten miles.

36:37.156 --> 36:39.199
(Daniel) Steven.

36:43.412 --> 36:46.665
I'm not sensing anything.
He's not Goa'uld.

36:54.339 --> 36:56.300
Steven.

36:56.383 --> 36:59.970
- He's bleeding internally.
- Steven, it's me.

37:00.095 --> 37:02.055
Daniel.

37:02.431 --> 37:04.892
What happened?

37:05.642 --> 37:09.396
I took the amulet.
It's over 10,000 years old,...

37:09.521 --> 37:13.442
..so your theory was right
all along. I'm sorry.

37:16.737 --> 37:20.073
Just take it easy, OK?
I need you to hold still.

37:20.157 --> 37:22.284
It's OK. She's a friend.

37:22.367 --> 37:25.370
- What about the jar?
- Huh?

37:25.454 --> 37:27.664
The Osiris jar. Did you open it?

37:28.499 --> 37:30.542
No.

37:32.377 --> 37:34.671
Why did you come here?

37:34.755 --> 37:37.841
I figured out the amulet was a key.

37:37.925 --> 37:40.219
There's a hidden chamber.

37:40.302 --> 37:42.763
I wanted to make the discovery.

37:44.181 --> 37:48.977
- Daniel, we have to get him outta here.
- Steven, who did this to you?

37:53.565 --> 37:55.609
(distorted) I did.

37:57.194 --> 37:59.238
Sarah?

38:18.090 --> 38:20.133
Daniel Jackson.

38:21.385 --> 38:24.054
You seem to know much of the Goa'uld.

38:24.137 --> 38:28.517
Much more than any other human
I have encountered since my awakening.

38:28.600 --> 38:31.520
Now, tell me,...

38:32.896 --> 38:35.607
..where is the Stargate?

38:36.900 --> 38:39.361
I don't know what you're talking about.

38:42.406 --> 38:44.449
Insolence.

38:51.331 --> 38:54.418
This temple was once
filled with worshippers.

38:54.543 --> 38:58.630
- Yeah, well, times have changed.
- So I have observed.

38:59.047 --> 39:01.592
Where is my brother Setesh?

39:01.675 --> 39:04.386
You mean Seth?

39:04.469 --> 39:08.140
He's dead. We, uh, we killed him.

39:09.057 --> 39:11.351
- You lie.
- No.

39:11.435 --> 39:14.062
No, we also killed Ra and Hathor...

39:14.146 --> 39:16.356
..and, uh, who else?

39:16.440 --> 39:18.567
Sokar.

39:18.692 --> 39:21.653
Then you have done me a great favour.

39:21.737 --> 39:24.114
I will rule without opposition.

39:24.239 --> 39:28.952
No. No, you won't rule at all. You see,
we don't worship false gods any more.

39:29.077 --> 39:31.455
You have come far, it is true.

39:31.538 --> 39:33.749
But you are still weak.

39:33.874 --> 39:38.170
Even now, you are torn
between your desire to kill me...

39:38.253 --> 39:40.547
..and your concern for my host,...

39:41.882 --> 39:44.801
..she who freed me from my long sleep.

39:49.056 --> 39:51.183
What do you know of my queen?

39:56.855 --> 39:58.106
Um...

39:58.190 --> 40:00.567
She was trapped like you.

40:01.485 --> 40:03.695
We have the jar.

40:03.779 --> 40:06.490
Where is it?

40:06.573 --> 40:08.617
I'm not gonna tell you.

40:08.742 --> 40:11.036
You are mistaken.

40:18.836 --> 40:21.213
Where is my queen?

40:25.467 --> 40:27.511
Tell me.

40:34.393 --> 40:36.770
What is this?

40:36.895 --> 40:39.356
What have you done?

40:42.442 --> 40:45.362
You will pay for this impudence.

41:42.628 --> 41:45.172
Make no mistake,...

41:45.297 --> 41:48.300
..Osiris will return,...

41:48.383 --> 41:52.554
..and the rivers of the earth
will run red with blood.

42:21.542 --> 42:23.836
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah.

42:23.961 --> 42:26.505
Yeah. I think I'm getting used to that thing.

42:26.630 --> 42:29.967
- Where's Osiris?
- Gone.

42:31.218 --> 42:33.262
Steven?

42:34.179 --> 42:38.475
If we get him out of here right now,
I think he'll make it.

42:38.600 --> 42:43.146
In the meantime, I guess we'd better...
make up a story to tell him.
