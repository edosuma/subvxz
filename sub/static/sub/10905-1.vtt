02:18.003 --> 02:20.772
BOBBY SEALE AND HUEY NEWTON,
SAYING 2 WORDS...

02:20.840 --> 02:22.440
"DEFEND YOURSELVES."

02:22.508 --> 02:25.443
STORY HAS IT THAT THEY
HOOKED UP AT SOME COFFEEHOUSE

02:25.511 --> 02:27.712
WHERE BOBBY WAS
RUNNING DOWN A RHYME.

02:27.780 --> 02:30.448
OH, YEAH.
IT'S EASY TO SEE...

02:30.516 --> 02:33.451

NO POT TO PISS IN.

03:06.585 --> 03:07.769
NOTHING LIKE THAT.

03:07.836 --> 03:09.771
JUST 2 FED-UP BROTHERS.

NOT BY PRAYING

07:19.404 --> 07:21.405

07:24.476 --> 07:25.977
THE COMMUNITY

12:06.608 --> 12:09.009
I KNOW WE NEED

12:09.077 --> 12:11.011
BUT I AIN'T JOINED
THIS MOTHERFUCKER

12:11.079 --> 12:13.147

MY ASS KICKED.

12:13.215 --> 12:14.648

12:14.716 --> 12:16.950

12:17.018 --> 12:18.452
OH, MAN.
TCH.

12:18.520 --> 12:21.455
REMEMBER, THE MEEK

12:21.523 --> 12:23.457
WAIT, WAIT, HOLD.
LOOK, FELLAS,

12:23.525 --> 12:25.459
WHAT WE NEED TO DO...

12:25.527 --> 12:28.662
IS PRAY
FOR THEIR FORGIVENESS.

12:28.730 --> 12:30.264
THEY KNOW NOT
WHAT THEY DO.

12:30.332 --> 12:31.765
HEY, NO OFFENSE,
REVEREND,

12:31.833 --> 12:32.843
BUT THEY BEEN
PRACTICING ON US

12:32.867 --> 12:34.301
FOR 400 YEARS.

12:34.369 --> 12:37.538
THEY KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT THEY DOING.

12:37.606 --> 12:39.840
BROTHER MALCOLM SAID
WE NEED TO STOP SINGING

12:39.907 --> 12:42.643
AND START SWINGING.

12:42.710 --> 12:43.978
Y'ALL CAN RANT AND RAVE,

12:44.045 --> 12:46.380
BUT IT'S THE POLICE
WHO GOT THE GUN.

12:46.447 --> 12:48.482
SHIT, IF BLACK FOLKS
HAD GUNS,

12:48.549 --> 12:50.985
WE'D PROBABLY SHOOT
EACH OTHER WITH THEM.

12:51.052 --> 12:52.486
AW!
TCH!

12:52.553 --> 12:55.489
LORD, WHY DON'T THEY
SHOW US NO RESPECT?

12:55.556 --> 12:57.491
BECAUSE THEY DON'T
HAVE TO.

12:57.558 --> 13:00.394
THEY THINK THEY CAN
BRUTALIZE US AND LOCK US UP

13:00.461 --> 13:02.296
WITHOUT A JURY
OF OUR PEERS

13:02.363 --> 13:04.165
'CAUSE WE'RE IGNORANT
TO THE LAWS.

13:04.232 --> 13:07.101
WE NEED TO ORGANIZE,
KEEP OUR SHIT CORRECT,

13:07.169 --> 13:08.702
AND EXERCISE OUR
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT

13:08.770 --> 13:10.004
AS CITIZENS

13:10.071 --> 13:11.939
TO DEFEND OURSELVES
AND ARM OURSELVES.

13:12.007 --> 13:13.908
THEN IF THEY TRY
TO BRUTALIZE US

13:13.975 --> 13:15.442
OR VIOLATE OUR RIGHTS,

13:15.510 --> 13:16.720
WE GOT A RIGHT AND MEANS
TO DEFEND OURSELVES.

13:16.744 --> 13:18.279
WHAT THE HELL
THE BOY SAYING?

13:18.346 --> 13:20.747
THE MAN SAID
WE CAN CARRY GUNS.

13:20.816 --> 13:21.748
IT'S LEGAL.

13:21.817 --> 13:23.017
THAT'S RIGHT.

13:23.084 --> 13:25.585
Y'ALL GOING TO
GET GUNS AND SHOOT COPS?

13:25.653 --> 13:27.587
NO, IT AIN'T ABOUT
SHOOTING COPS.

13:27.655 --> 13:29.456
IT'S ABOUT GETTING
THE MAN'S ATTENTION

13:29.524 --> 13:31.625
AND SHOWING
OUR COMMUNITY

13:31.693 --> 13:34.795
THAT WE AIN'T GOT TO
TAKE THIS SHIT NO MORE.

13:34.863 --> 13:36.396
THE ESTABLISHMENT,
IT DON'T LISTEN

13:36.464 --> 13:38.498
WHEN WE SING, PRAY, OR BEG.

13:38.566 --> 13:41.501
BUT THEY SEE SOME DISCIPLINED
BROTHERS WITH GUNS,

13:41.569 --> 13:44.404
THEY'LL KNOW THE BLACK PANTHER
PARTY FOR SELF DEFENSE

13:44.472 --> 13:47.507
IS SERIOUS ABOUT DEFENDING
THE RIGHTS OF OUR PEOPLE.

13:47.575 --> 13:48.976
ALL POWER
TO THE PEOPLE.

13:49.044 --> 13:50.244
ALL POWER
TO THE PEOPLE.

13:50.312 --> 13:53.113
ALL POWER TO THE PEOPLE!

13:55.183 --> 13:57.284
FREE AT LAST,
MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

13:57.352 --> 14:01.188
GOD HAS DELIVERED US
FROM THE LION'S DEN.

14:04.259 --> 14:06.493
REVEREND, WE BLACK
WHERE WE STARTED.

14:06.561 --> 14:08.529
WE STILL AIN'T GOT
A STOPLIGHT.

14:08.597 --> 14:09.963
AS THE REVEREND SAYS,

14:10.031 --> 14:12.933
GOD HELPS THOSE
THAT HELP THEMSELVES.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.535
WE'LL BE OUR OWN
STOPLIGHT.

14:14.603 --> 14:17.538
Y'ALL NEED A HOT MEAL
AND A HOT BATH.

14:17.606 --> 14:18.839
HOW'S MOM?

14:18.906 --> 14:21.358
WE LEARN THROUGH OBSERVATION
AND PARTICIPATION.

14:21.426 --> 14:22.893
YES!

14:24.796 --> 14:26.463
HEY. HEY!

14:26.531 --> 14:29.466
WHAT YOU DOING THERE?
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

14:29.534 --> 14:31.002
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL, MAN.

14:31.069 --> 14:32.903
THEY BEING THEIR OWN
STOPLIGHT.

14:32.971 --> 14:35.472
CY, WHAT IS THAT
GOING TO DO, MAN?

14:35.540 --> 14:37.018
COME ON, JUDGE. WE GOT
TO START SOMEWHERE.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.909
I'M GOING TO START
BY GETTING ON MY FEET.

14:38.977 --> 14:40.521
WORKING ON THINGS
FROM INSIDE THE SYSTEM.

14:40.545 --> 14:42.179
THAT'S WHY
I VOLUNTEERED FOR NAM...

14:42.247 --> 14:43.480
TO GET THE G.I. BILL.

14:43.548 --> 14:44.949
THAT'S BULLSHIT.
YOU VOLUNTEERED

14:45.017 --> 14:46.483
TO BEAT
THAT JOYRIDING RAP.

14:46.551 --> 14:48.986
MAN, INSIDE
AIN'T IN THE SYSTEM.

14:49.054 --> 14:51.488
IT'S RIGHT THERE
INSIDE OF YOU.

14:51.556 --> 14:53.490
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M JOINING, MAN.

14:53.558 --> 14:55.192
YOU WHAT?

14:55.260 --> 14:58.462
I'M GOING TO JOIN
THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY.

14:58.530 --> 15:01.198
CY, MAN,
YOU DON'T NEED TO...

15:01.266 --> 15:02.626
Martin Luther King:

15:02.784 --> 15:04.535
AND CHALLENGE THEM
WITH THE ALTERNATIVE...

15:04.602 --> 15:06.503
YOU BE CAREFUL,
ALL RIGHT?

15:06.571 --> 15:09.506

OBJECTION.

15:09.708 --> 15:12.443
AND I SAY THIS MORNING

15:12.511 --> 15:13.444
MY GOD.

15:13.512 --> 15:15.946

LET YOU OUT?

15:16.014 --> 15:17.948

I'M ALL RIGHT.
HOW ABOUT YOU?

15:20.018 --> 15:21.452

15:21.520 --> 15:24.455
WHIPPING UP ON THAT COP
LIKE YOU WAS CRAZY.

15:24.523 --> 15:26.957
THAT COP WAS TRYING
TO HIT MY MAMA.

15:27.025 --> 15:28.459
I CAN'T HAVE THAT.
YOU KNOW.

15:28.527 --> 15:29.960
COME HERE.

15:30.028 --> 15:31.962
Martin Luther King:
NO MATTER WHAT YOU THINK

15:32.030 --> 15:34.465
OF MR. MUHAMMAD ALI'S
RELIGION...

15:34.533 --> 15:36.467
WHAT WOULD
YOUR DADDY SAY?

15:36.535 --> 15:39.470
BOTH OF US LOCKED UP
IN PRISON

15:39.538 --> 15:41.472
LIKE 2 JAILBIRDS.

15:41.540 --> 15:43.740
I DON'T KNOW.

15:46.044 --> 15:48.345

ROUGHNECK FRIENDS

15:48.413 --> 15:50.981
YOU MET IN JAIL
OVER THERE?

15:51.049 --> 15:53.084
MOM, IT'S NOT

15:53.151 --> 15:55.319
THOSE FELLAS...
THEY ALL RIGHT.

15:55.387 --> 15:58.322
THEY WAS OUT THERE
TRYING TO DO SOMETHING.

15:58.390 --> 16:00.991
WELL, THOSE FELLAS,
THOSE BLACK PANTHERS,

16:01.059 --> 16:02.993
I HEAR THEY'RE
COMMUNIST.

16:03.061 --> 16:05.162
THEY DON'T EVEN
BELIEVE IN GOD.

16:05.230 --> 16:11.001
MA, BLACK FOLKS BEEN PRAYING
TO GOD FOR 400 YEARS.

16:11.069 --> 16:14.138
MAYBE IT'S TIME
WE TRIED SOMETHING ELSE.

16:14.206 --> 16:17.007
YOU BELIEVE THAT?

16:17.075 --> 16:19.710
I DON'T KNOW.
I REALLY DON'T.

16:21.513 --> 16:22.946
I TELL YOU ONE THING.

16:23.014 --> 16:26.683
THEM BOYS KEEP ON
THE WAY THEY KEEPING ON,

16:27.119 --> 16:30.054
IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT
OF TROUBLE AROUND HERE.

16:35.026 --> 16:37.461
THOSE THINGS DON'T WORK,
BELIEVE ME.

16:37.528 --> 16:39.463
DON'T I KNOW IT.

16:39.530 --> 16:42.065
COME ON IN,
AGENT RODGERS.

16:42.134 --> 16:44.568
ALWAYS A PLEASURE
TO SEE YOU.

16:44.636 --> 16:47.971
WHAT CAN I DO
TO BE OF HELP?

16:48.140 --> 16:50.457
WELL, IT SEEMS
THE BAY AREA

16:50.525 --> 16:53.727
HAS BECOME A REAL HORNET'S NEST
FOR SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES.

16:53.794 --> 16:57.197
MR. HOOVER WOULD
JUST LIKE TO REITERATE

16:57.265 --> 17:00.234
THAT THE FBI IS WILLING
TO HELP THE AUTHORITIES

17:00.301 --> 17:01.801
IN ANY WAY THEY CAN,

17:01.869 --> 17:04.671
STRICTLY ON AN ADVISORY
BASIS, OF COURSE.

17:04.739 --> 17:07.473
OF COURSE. WELL,
I APPRECIATE YOUR HELP,

17:07.541 --> 17:09.042
BUT I THINK
WE HAVE THINGS

17:09.109 --> 17:10.577
PRETTY WELL
UNDER CONTROL.

17:10.645 --> 17:12.646
JUST THE USUAL
BUNCH OF KOOKS

17:12.713 --> 17:15.214
THAT YOU GUYS HAVE
HAD UNDER SURVEILLANCE.

17:15.282 --> 17:18.117
THEY'RE STILL MAKING
NOISE AND SMOKING POT,

17:18.185 --> 17:20.354
BUT NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

17:20.422 --> 17:22.923
AND WHAT CAN YOU
TELL ME ABOUT

17:22.990 --> 17:25.425
THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY
FOR SELF DEFENSE?

17:25.492 --> 17:27.428
THEY'RE JUST A BUNCH
OF SHINES

17:27.494 --> 17:29.163
RUNNING AROUND
SHAKING THEIR FISTS

17:29.230 --> 17:30.730
ABOUT SOME STREETLIGHT.

17:30.798 --> 17:33.100
THEY'RE LOUD, BUT
THEY'RE NOT DANGEROUS.

17:33.168 --> 17:35.902
IS IT POSSIBLE WE CAN
MAKE A DEAL WITH THEM?

17:35.970 --> 17:38.439
NO... THEY'RE...
THEY'RE KIDS, MOSTLY.

17:38.506 --> 17:39.940
IDEALISTS.

17:40.007 --> 17:42.776
THEY THINK, ACTUALLY,
THEY'RE FOR REAL.

17:46.881 --> 17:49.083
YOU WANT ME
TO PUT A MAN ON IT?

17:50.318 --> 17:52.686
I THINK THAT'D BE
A GOOD IDEA.

17:55.923 --> 17:57.458
TAKE CARE
OF THAT STOMACH.

17:57.525 --> 17:58.959
OH, YEAH,
BY THE WAY,

17:59.027 --> 18:01.962
I WOULD APPRECIATE IT
IF THAT MAN OF YOURS

18:02.030 --> 18:03.730
WOULD KEEP
A LOW PROFILE.

18:13.775 --> 18:15.709
2 BETS.

30:12.526 --> 30:13.960
I CONFIRMED MY ADDRESS.

30:14.028 --> 30:15.962
THAT'S ALL I'M REQUIRED
BY CALIFORNIA LAW TO DO.

30:16.030 --> 30:17.196
WE AIN'T BROKEN NO LAW.

30:18.565 --> 30:19.643
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH YOURS?

30:19.667 --> 30:21.067
LET ME SEE THAT RIFLE.

30:21.135 --> 30:22.368
NO! IT'S PRIVATE PROPERTY.

30:22.435 --> 30:23.870
ACCORDING TO CALIFORNIA LAW,

30:23.937 --> 30:29.441
WE GOT A CONSTITUTIONAL
RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS.

30:29.509 --> 30:31.510
MOVE ALONG. GO ON

30:34.915 --> 30:37.316
THIS IS YOUR BUSINESS!
STAY RIGHT HERE!

30:37.384 --> 30:40.853
THE LAW SAYS, YOU STAY
AT A REASONABLE DISTANCE...

30:40.921 --> 30:42.321
THAT'S 8 TO 10 FEET...

30:42.389 --> 30:44.657
YOU GOT A RIGHT
TO OBSERVE THE POLICE

30:44.725 --> 30:46.659
CARRYING OUT THEIR DUTIES!

30:46.727 --> 30:49.595

THE BLACK PANTHERS.

31:00.040 --> 31:01.440
IS THAT GUN
LOADED, BOY?

31:01.508 --> 31:03.743
THE FISH AND GAME LAW
CLEARLY STATES

31:03.811 --> 31:05.845
IT'S UNLAWFUL TO CARRY
A LIVE ROUND OF AMMUNITION

31:05.913 --> 31:07.847
IN THE CHAMBER
OF A SHOTGUN OR A RIFLE

31:07.915 --> 31:09.315
IN A VEHICLE... PIG!

31:10.851 --> 31:12.651
REFER TO HIM
AS OFFICER.

31:12.720 --> 31:14.887
THEN DON'T REFER
TO HIM AS BOY.

31:14.955 --> 31:16.956
WELL, IS IT LOADED?

31:17.024 --> 31:19.859
IT WASN'T, OFFICER.
BUT NOW IT IS.

31:20.961 --> 31:23.863
Man: WHOA, THAT'S
A BAD-ASS NIGGER!

31:23.931 --> 31:25.698
WHAT DO THOSE GUNS
MEAN?

31:25.766 --> 31:27.033
THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY
DECLARES

31:27.101 --> 31:30.036
YOU TRY TO BRUTALIZE OUR
COMMUNITY OR TAKE OUR WEAPONS,

31:30.104 --> 31:31.637
WE'LL SHOOT YOU.

31:37.945 --> 31:39.178
GET BACK!

31:47.621 --> 31:52.058
Woman: JESUS, I THINK
I DONE DIED AND GONE TO HEAVEN!

31:52.126 --> 31:53.259
Man:
HALLELUJAH!

32:06.406 --> 32:07.857
ALL RIGHT.
HOLD IT.

32:07.925 --> 32:09.359
PUT IT THERE.

32:09.426 --> 32:11.627
THE BROTHER HAD
HIS RIFLE UP LIKE THIS.

32:11.695 --> 32:12.962
CALLED THE POLICE A PIG.

32:13.030 --> 32:14.463
THE POLICE
COULDN'T DO NOTHING.

32:14.531 --> 32:16.465
THE BROTHER WAS SPEAKING
ALL KIND OF LAW SHIT.

32:16.533 --> 32:17.967
THIS HERE'S
OUR 10-POINT PROGRAM.

32:18.035 --> 32:19.969
THESE BROTHERS
WASN'T SCARED OF SHIT!

32:20.037 --> 32:22.972
THE POLICE COULDN'T DO
A DAMN THING!

32:23.040 --> 32:25.975
YOU AIN'T NEVER SEEN
NOTHING LIKE IT.

32:26.043 --> 32:27.476
"POINT 1... WE WANT FREEDOM.

32:27.544 --> 32:29.189
"WE WANT THE POWER
TO DETERMINE THE DESTINY

32:29.213 --> 32:30.280
"OF OUR BLACK COMMUNITY.

32:30.347 --> 32:32.481
"2... WE WANT FULL EMPLOYMENT
FOR OUR PEOPLE.

32:32.549 --> 32:35.385
"3... WE WANT AN END
TO THE ROBBERY

32:35.452 --> 32:37.020
BY CAPITALISTS
OF OUR BLACK COMMUNITY."

32:37.087 --> 32:39.889
CHRIST, THEY'RE ASKING
FOR REPARATIONS.

32:39.957 --> 32:42.358
THEY COULDN'T HAVE
THOUGHT THIS UP THEMSELVES.

32:42.426 --> 32:43.826
YEAH, SOUNDS LIKE
THE CONSTITUTION,

32:43.894 --> 32:45.461
MAYBE SOME BILL OF RIGHTS
THROWN IN.

32:45.529 --> 32:48.497
INSPECTOR BRIMMER,
THIS IS NO JOKE.

32:48.565 --> 32:52.335
DURING YOUR SURVEILLANCE,
DID YOU SEE ANY COMMUNISTS

32:52.403 --> 32:53.669
OR OUTSIDE AGITATORS?

32:53.737 --> 32:56.005
I SAW COLORED PEOPLE
HANDING OUT FOOD,

32:56.073 --> 32:57.506
HAVING MEETINGS,
PAINTING,

32:57.574 --> 32:59.008
AND PATROLLING
THE NEIGHBORHOOD

32:59.076 --> 33:00.910
AND HAVING MORE MEETINGS.

33:00.978 --> 33:03.913
THEY ARE UNDERMINING
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!

33:03.981 --> 33:07.350
AND YOU, INSPECTOR, ARE NOT
TAKING YOUR JOB SERIOUSLY.

33:07.418 --> 33:08.851
NOW, COME ON, RODGERS.

33:08.919 --> 33:10.519
NOW, DORSETT,

33:10.587 --> 33:13.456
IF THE BLACK PANTHERS
REMAIN IN YOUR JURISDICTION,

33:13.523 --> 33:15.258
FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES
HAVE TO BE MADE.

33:15.326 --> 33:16.259
LIKE WHAT?

33:16.327 --> 33:17.760
LIKE YOU,
INSPECTOR BRIMMER,

33:17.828 --> 33:20.763
ARE NOT SITTING
IN YOUR CAR ANYMORE.

33:20.831 --> 33:22.098
I THINK IT'S TIME

33:22.166 --> 33:24.800
YOU TOOK A LITTLE MORE
ACTIVE INVOLVEMENT.

33:33.877 --> 33:36.812
ANOTHER BUSY DAY
KEEPING THE STREETS SAFE?

33:36.880 --> 33:39.815
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
OUT SO LATE?

33:39.883 --> 33:42.818
I LIKE TO WATCH OVER
MY CLIENT'S INVESTMENTS.

33:42.886 --> 33:45.955
WE REALLY SHOULD ADDRESS
THAT BUSINESS EXPANSION.

33:46.023 --> 33:47.690
LOOK, I DON'T THINK...

33:47.757 --> 33:49.392
THAT'S A NICE CAR.

33:49.460 --> 33:50.460
IT'S NICE.

33:50.527 --> 33:54.163
YOU REMEMBER WHO
PAID FOR IT, RIGHT?

33:54.231 --> 33:55.664
WE'LL TALK AGAIN...

33:55.732 --> 33:57.166
SOON.

34:03.407 --> 34:06.509
DID YOU SEE US
ON GROVE STREET

34:06.576 --> 34:09.344
ALL UP ON THE COPS
WITH THAT LAW SHIT?

34:09.413 --> 34:10.679
MAN, IT WAS PERFECT!

34:10.746 --> 34:12.132
IT WAS ALL RIGHT.

34:14.567 --> 34:16.235
GIVE ME A LIFT, MAN?

34:16.303 --> 34:17.735
YOU GOT IT.

34:17.804 --> 34:19.571
BERKELEY CAMPUS?

34:19.639 --> 34:22.942
MAN... NO.

34:23.010 --> 34:24.810
LET'S GO TO
PANTHER HEADQUARTERS.

34:24.878 --> 34:28.714
WE COULD HANG OUT
MORE LIKE WE USED TO.

34:30.583 --> 34:32.684
HA HA! MY BROTHER!

34:32.752 --> 34:33.685
OHH!

34:33.753 --> 34:37.223
I GOT TO TAKE CARE
OF YOU, KID.

34:37.291 --> 34:39.190
GOING TO BE DOWN NOW,
HUH?

34:39.259 --> 34:40.692
AM I DOWN?

34:40.760 --> 34:44.196
I'M DOWN LIKE 4 FLATS
ON A DUMP TRUCK.

34:44.264 --> 34:45.831
SEE, I'M P-D HO.

34:45.899 --> 34:47.533
THAT'S SHORT FOR
"PIMP DOWN HOME."

34:47.600 --> 34:50.735
I SAW YOU PANTHERS
ON GROVE STREET.

34:50.804 --> 34:53.539
EVERYBODY KNOW
Y'ALL GOT THE FINEST PUSSY.

34:53.606 --> 34:55.741
SO SIGN A NIGGER UP.

34:55.809 --> 34:57.243
AS LONG AS
I CAN KEEP MY JOB,

34:57.311 --> 34:58.744
AND KEEP PUTTING FOOD
ON THE TABLE,

34:58.812 --> 34:59.946
I WANT TO BE A PANTHER.

35:00.013 --> 35:02.281
WHITEY DROPS NAPALM
ON THE YELLOW MAN,

35:02.349 --> 35:04.616
SLAUGHTERS AND BETRAYS
THE RED MAN,

35:04.684 --> 35:06.618
ENSLAVES AND MUTILATES
THE BLACK MAN,

35:06.686 --> 35:09.621
AND FUCKS WITH ANYBODY ELSE
HE CAN.

35:09.689 --> 35:10.923
I GOT IT.

35:10.991 --> 35:12.191
YOU GOT THIS
UNDER CONTROL?

35:12.259 --> 35:13.192
ALL RIGHT.

35:13.260 --> 35:15.194
THANKS, BROTHER.
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

35:15.262 --> 35:16.495
JUDGE IS JOINING US.

35:16.563 --> 35:18.530

35:18.598 --> 35:19.976
Bobby: CONGRATULATIONS,

35:20.000 --> 35:21.300
THIS MAKES IT OFFICIAL.

35:21.368 --> 35:24.303
COME IN CLEAN, SOBER,
AND READY TO WORK.

35:24.371 --> 35:25.804
COMMUNITY'S
THE FOCAL POINT.

35:25.872 --> 35:27.306
I GOT THAT.

35:27.374 --> 35:28.807
10-POINT PROGRAM.

35:28.875 --> 35:30.977
HUEY WANTS
TO SEE YOU.

35:31.044 --> 35:31.978

35:32.045 --> 35:33.379
YEAH, YOU.

35:33.447 --> 35:35.747
SAID HE THOUGHT
YOU'D BE COMING BY.

35:40.220 --> 35:42.154
TV Reporter:
IN OTHER NATIONAL NEWS,

35:42.222 --> 35:43.822
PRESIDENT JOHNSON'S
PRESS SECRETARY

35:43.890 --> 35:46.459
HAS EMPHATICALLY DENIED
THE RUMOR THAT THE WHITE HOUSE

35:46.526 --> 35:49.462
IS CONSIDERING ORDERING
THE BOMBING OF CAMBODIA

35:49.529 --> 35:51.497
BY OUR STRATEGIC BOMBERS.

35:51.564 --> 35:54.500
THE VIETCONG HAVE
FURTHER ATTACKED...

35:54.567 --> 35:56.268
WELCOME.

35:56.336 --> 35:59.738
BROTHER JUDGE, HAVE YOU DECIDED
TO GET DOWN WITH US?

36:02.542 --> 36:04.243
YEAH, I'M DOWN.

36:04.311 --> 36:06.545
YOU WERE VERY HELPFUL
WITH THOSE GUNS.

36:06.613 --> 36:08.814
YOUR SOLDIER SHIT...
BAD ASS.

36:08.882 --> 36:11.817
I'D HOPED TO BE DONE
WITH ALL THAT.

36:11.885 --> 36:13.819
YOU'RE LUCKY
TO BE BACK.

36:13.887 --> 36:17.189
MOST BROTHERS DIE
ON THE FRONT LINES.

36:17.257 --> 36:19.458
SEEMS LIKE THAT'S WHAT
THEY'RE THERE FOR.

36:20.793 --> 36:23.429
MIND IF I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

36:23.497 --> 36:26.598
WHERE'D YOU GET THE MONEY
TO GO TO SCHOOL?

36:26.666 --> 36:27.599
G.I. BILL,

36:27.667 --> 36:30.002
PLUS I GOT SOME
SHRAPNEL IN MY LEG.

36:30.070 --> 36:31.937
IT'S NO PROBLEM
ANYMORE,

36:32.005 --> 36:33.939
BUT I STILL GET MY
DISABILITY CHECKS.

36:34.007 --> 36:36.042
WE HIT A LAND MINE.

36:36.109 --> 36:38.227
I THOUGHT A LAND MINE
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FATAL.

36:38.295 --> 36:41.664
IT WAS FOR THE 2
GUYS IN FRONT OF ME.

36:41.731 --> 36:43.832
OH, YOU VOLUNTEERED
OR SOMETHING?

36:43.900 --> 36:45.000
REFORM SCHOOL.

36:45.068 --> 36:47.403
THE COURT SAID THAT
OR THE MILITARY.

36:49.473 --> 36:50.839
IF I'D STAYED HERE,

36:50.907 --> 36:52.475
I'D END UP DRUNK
OR DEAD.

36:52.543 --> 36:54.009
WHY ALL THE QUESTIONS,
MAN?

36:55.479 --> 36:57.980
SECURITY.

36:58.048 --> 36:59.915
SECURITY

BOBBY, TAKE HIM
AND GO INSIDE.

37:23.440 --> 37:24.440
NOW!

37:29.012 --> 37:31.914
WHAT WOULD YOU TELL YOUNG
BROTHERS AND SISTERS TO DO

37:31.982 --> 37:34.450
IN FOLLOWING
BROTHER MALCOLM'S FOOTSTEPS?

37:34.517 --> 37:37.453
WELL,
I WOULD SAY THAT...

37:37.520 --> 37:39.956
MALCOLM LIVES
IN EACH OF US,

37:40.023 --> 37:42.491

37:42.559 --> 37:43.960
FOR THE COMMUNITY,

37:44.027 --> 37:46.428

37:46.496 --> 37:48.430
SISTER SHABAZZ, WE THANK YOU.

37:48.498 --> 37:49.932
WE'RE HONORED THAT YOU'VE

37:50.000 --> 37:51.433
CHOSEN SAN FRANCISCO

37:51.501 --> 37:53.903
FOR YOUR FIRST
PUBLIC APPEARANCE

37:53.971 --> 37:55.471
SINCE THE MARTYRDOM
OF MALCOLM.

37:55.538 --> 37:58.474
DO YOU FEEL THE FERVOR
OF THE MOVEMENT WAS LOST

37:58.541 --> 37:59.976
WITH THE DEATH OF MALCOLM?

38:00.043 --> 38:01.610
NO. THE THIRST FOR FREEDOM

38:01.678 --> 38:03.712
WASN'T EXTINGUISHED
WITH HIS MURDER.

38:03.780 --> 38:06.916
THE DESIRE FOR LIBERTY
IS MANIFESTED DAILY...

38:06.984 --> 38:09.418
THE POLICE IS
PULLING UP OUTSIDE.

38:09.486 --> 38:10.419
FALL IN.

38:10.487 --> 38:11.653
LET'S GO, LITTLE BOBBY.

38:14.491 --> 38:16.425
BROTHER HUEY,

THANK YOU.

38:18.862 --> 38:21.297
I'M NOT GOING.
I'M NOT GOING.

38:21.365 --> 38:22.798
LET'S PUT THIS GUN AWAY.

38:22.866 --> 38:24.300
I AIN'T GOING TO JAIL.

38:31.408 --> 38:32.841
Reporter:
THERE SHE IS.

38:32.910 --> 38:34.343
HEY, HEY, HEY.

38:34.411 --> 38:36.045
MISS SHABAZZ,
DO YOU FEAR FOR YOUR LIFE?

38:36.113 --> 38:37.546
NO PICTURES TODAY.

38:37.614 --> 38:39.148
BACK UP!

38:39.216 --> 38:40.649
WHO SHOT MALCOLM?

38:40.717 --> 38:43.452
DO YOU THINK
THE FBI WAS LINKED...

38:43.520 --> 38:44.453
NO STATEMENT.

38:44.521 --> 38:47.306
DO YOU THINK FARRAKHAN
WAS INVOLVED?

38:47.374 --> 38:49.825
MOVE BACK! YOU'RE
BLOCKING HER PATH!

38:49.893 --> 38:51.593

38:56.566 --> 38:57.833
LEAVE

48:41.501 --> 48:44.436
STALL A LITTLE SO THEY
THINK YOU'RE FOR REAL.

48:44.504 --> 48:47.372
EAT UP YOUR FOOD.
GET SOME NUTRITION.

48:47.440 --> 48:50.475
TYRONE, YOU THINK
FEEDING OUR CHILDREN

48:50.543 --> 48:51.576
WILL MAKE THE MAN JUMPY?

48:51.644 --> 48:53.078

48:53.146 --> 48:55.813

IN THEIR OWN HANDS.

49:00.719 --> 49:03.388

THIS WORLD'S COMING TO.

49:13.466 --> 49:14.399
OFFICER, NO!

49:14.467 --> 49:15.467

49:15.501 --> 49:17.735

THE POLICE LIED.

49:25.545 --> 49:28.980
THEY SAID HE WAS TRYING
TO STEAL A CAR.

49:29.048 --> 49:31.483
MY BABY

49:31.551 --> 49:32.551
MAMA...

MAMA, THESE BROTHERS HERE

49:34.987 --> 49:37.755

I ASKED THEM OVER
FROM OAKLAND.

49:39.825 --> 49:42.760
I THANK Y'ALL FOR COMING
TO GRIEVE WITH US.

49:42.828 --> 49:44.596
POLICE WON'T TELL US

49:44.663 --> 49:47.099
THEY BEEN SHOOTING
BLACK MEN AROUND HERE

49:47.166 --> 49:48.933
LIKE WE GOING
OUT OF STYLE.

49:49.001 --> 49:49.934
LORD HAVE MERCY.

49:50.002 --> 49:52.904
MY BOY DIDN'T DO NOTHING.

49:52.972 --> 49:56.674
CAN'T SOMEBODY
DO SOMETHING?

49:56.742 --> 50:00.145
YES, MA'AM. WE CAME

50:08.304 --> 50:09.638
ALL POWER TO THE PEOPLE!

50:09.706 --> 50:11.139

50:11.207 --> 50:12.708
THE POLICE SAY

50:12.775 --> 50:16.177
BROTHER DENZIL DOWELL
WAS TRYING TO STEAL A CAR.

50:17.246 --> 50:19.180
THAT HE LEAPED A FENCE

50:19.248 --> 50:22.818
AND RAN THROUGH A FIELD
OF BROKEN GLASS AND OIL,

50:23.019 --> 50:24.319
BUT WHEN WE CHECKED,

50:24.387 --> 50:27.990
THE BOTTOM OF HIS SHOES
WERE CLEAN.

50:28.057 --> 50:30.692
IF ANY OF Y'ALL KNEW DENZIL,

50:30.760 --> 50:33.996
YOU KNEW
HE WAS IN A CAR ACCIDENT,

50:34.430 --> 50:36.514
THAT HE WALKED WITH A LIMP.

50:36.582 --> 50:38.116
HE COULDN'T HAVE HOPPED
ANY FENCE.

50:38.184 --> 50:39.527
THE POLICE REPORT
SAYS QUITE CLEARLY

50:39.551 --> 50:42.620
DENZIL WAS SHOT 3 TIMES,

50:42.688 --> 50:44.689
BUT THE CORONER'S
REPORT SAYS

50:44.757 --> 50:47.025
DENZIL DOWELL WAS SHOT
6 TIMES.

50:47.326 --> 50:50.812
2 OF THOSE SHOTS
WERE IN HIS ARMPITS,

50:50.880 --> 50:52.030
BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

50:52.098 --> 50:53.531
YOU KNOW WHY THAT IS?

50:53.599 --> 50:56.968
BROTHER DENZIL
HAD HIS HANDS UP.

51:00.673 --> 51:01.990
WHAT DO WE WANT?

51:02.058 --> 51:03.291
JUSTICE!

51:03.359 --> 51:06.862
WE NEED MORE PROGRAMS.
THEY'RE IN THE CAR.

51:06.930 --> 51:09.230
AMEN, BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

51:09.566 --> 51:12.200
LET US BOW OUR HEADS
AND PRAY.

51:12.268 --> 51:14.236
I MISSED
YOUR PHONE CALL.

51:14.304 --> 51:16.238
SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME
ABOUT THIS.

51:16.306 --> 51:17.239
DON'T WORRY.

51:17.307 --> 51:18.240
I'M JUST PLAYING
ROUGH COP

51:18.308 --> 51:19.241
SO YOUR
SOUL BROTHERS

51:19.309 --> 51:20.242
WON'T KNOW
WE'RE PARTNERS.

51:20.310 --> 51:21.944
JUSTICE!

51:22.011 --> 51:23.094
WHAT DO WE WANT?

51:23.162 --> 51:25.430
COME ON, MAN.

51:25.498 --> 51:27.065
NO. IT'S JUST HARASSMENT.

51:27.132 --> 51:28.567
WE GOT MOMENTUM,
BROTHER.

51:28.634 --> 51:30.502
Crowd:
ALL POWER TO THE PEOPLE.

51:37.343 --> 51:39.877
YOU'RE NOT COMING
IN HERE WITH NO GUN.

51:39.945 --> 51:41.879
THE FIREARM
IS IN PLAIN VIEW,

51:41.947 --> 51:43.881
THEREFORE, IT'S LEGAL
BY CALIFORNIA STATUTE.

51:43.949 --> 51:46.384
THIS IS PUBLIC PROPERTY
PAID FOR BY THE PEOPLE.

51:46.452 --> 51:47.752
OVER MY DEAD BODY.

51:47.820 --> 51:48.920
THAT'S YOUR CALL,
PIG.

51:51.757 --> 51:54.192
WE DIDN'T COME
FOR BLOODSHED.

51:54.260 --> 51:56.027
WE COME FOR JUSTICE,

51:56.095 --> 51:58.263
BUT DON'T BE PUSHING US
TOO FAR.

51:58.331 --> 52:00.532
BOYS, PLEASE.

52:14.447 --> 52:16.882
Huey: IF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT
HAS NOTHING TO HIDE,

52:16.949 --> 52:19.284
WHY COULDN'T THE DOWELL
FAMILY OBSERVE THE BODY?

52:19.352 --> 52:20.585
IF HE BLED TO DEATH,

52:20.652 --> 52:22.320
WHY DOES
THE CORONER'S REPORT SAY

52:22.388 --> 52:24.089
HE WAS SHOT TO DEATH?

52:24.156 --> 52:25.533
WE DEMAND A GRAND JURY
INVESTIGATION

52:25.557 --> 52:26.597
INTO DENZIL DOWELL'S DEATH

52:26.658 --> 52:27.993
AND THE PATTERN
OF BRUTALITY

52:28.060 --> 52:29.995
AGAINST THE BLACK
CITIZENS OF RICHMOND.

52:30.062 --> 52:31.139
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT
HAS CONDUCTED

52:31.163 --> 52:32.998
ITS OWN INQUEST
AND CONCLUDED

52:33.065 --> 52:36.401
THAT NO MISCONDUCT
OCCURRED.

52:36.468 --> 52:38.904
AS FAR AS A PATTERN
OF BRUTALITY,

52:38.971 --> 52:41.273
THE CHARGE
IS RIDICULOUS.

52:41.340 --> 52:44.742
WHAT DO YOU CALL 4 DEAD
BLACK MEN IN 6 MONTHS?

52:44.810 --> 52:47.379
I CALL IT THE POLICE
DOING THEIR DUTY

52:47.446 --> 52:48.513
UNDER THE LAW.

52:48.580 --> 52:51.316
YOU GOT A PROBLEM
WITH ANY LAW,

52:51.384 --> 52:53.351
YOU TAKE IT
TO THE LEGISLATURE.

52:53.419 --> 52:56.288
I THINK THE PIG
MIGHT HAVE A POINT.

52:58.190 --> 53:00.625
GET THE HELL OUT
OF MY OFFICE!

53:02.061 --> 53:03.995
Brimmer: LOOK HERE,
THE LAW'S CHANGING.

53:04.063 --> 53:06.998
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO CARRY
THEM GUNS MUCH LONGER.

53:07.066 --> 53:08.934
WE UNDERSTAND
EACH OTHER, JUDGE?

53:09.001 --> 53:10.068
Judge: YEAH.

53:10.136 --> 53:12.437
ALL RIGHT. I EXPECT
TO HEAR FROM YOU REAL SOON.

53:12.504 --> 53:16.441
HUEY NEWTON TAKES A CRAP,
I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

53:16.508 --> 53:18.944
OTHERWISE, I'M GOING
TO COME LOOKING FOR YOU.

53:19.011 --> 53:21.947
I WON'T BE NEAR AS FRIENDLY
AS I WAS TODAY.

53:22.014 --> 53:23.949
JUDGE, YOU GOT TO
REMEMBER SOMETHING...

53:24.016 --> 53:26.952
YOU GOT A LOT AT STAKE
HERE.

53:27.019 --> 53:29.955
LOOK, THE PANTHERS
ARE GOING TO LOSE.

53:30.022 --> 53:31.456
THE ONLY QUESTION IS

53:31.523 --> 53:34.459
ARE YOU GOING TO LOSE
ALONG WITH THEM?

53:34.526 --> 53:36.161
YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE
YOUR FUTURE,

53:36.228 --> 53:37.462
YOUR MOTHER, YOUR LIFE.

53:37.529 --> 53:39.697
NOW THINK ABOUT IT.

53:40.933 --> 53:43.868
ALL RIGHT, SOLDIER,
GO ON. GET OUT OF HERE.

53:43.936 --> 53:44.936
GO ON.

53:49.708 --> 53:52.010
Bobby: HOW Y'ALL DOING
OUT THERE?

53:52.078 --> 53:53.011
ALL RIGHT!

53:53.079 --> 53:54.846
YOU KNOW,
IT'S INTERESTING.

53:54.913 --> 53:56.814
JUST AS BLACK PEOPLE
START TO EXERCISE

53:56.882 --> 53:58.883
THEIR RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS,

53:58.951 --> 54:01.352
THE PIGS
WANT TO CHANGE THE LAW.

54:01.421 --> 54:04.355
WE AIN'T GOING
TO MAKE IT EASY FOR THEM

54:04.424 --> 54:06.858
TO HAVE NO UNARMED TARGETS,
ARE WE?

54:06.926 --> 54:09.360
HAVE A GOOD TIME
AND ENJOY YOURSELVES

54:09.429 --> 54:11.195
'CAUSE THIS HERE
IS YOUR COMMUNITY.

54:11.263 --> 54:12.297
IT'S OUR COMMUNITY.

54:12.364 --> 54:13.799
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING.

54:13.866 --> 54:14.866
THAT'S RIGHT.

54:16.101 --> 54:18.036
JUST DO ME ONE FAVOR.

54:18.103 --> 54:20.539
SAVE ME SOME OF THAT
BARBECUE OUT THERE.

54:20.606 --> 54:22.541

55:17.246 --> 55:18.179
THAT'S 30.

55:18.247 --> 55:20.682
THIS IS GOING TO BE
A COLOSSAL EVENT.

55:20.750 --> 55:23.184
WE'RE GOING TO TURN
THE CAPITAL OUT.

55:23.252 --> 55:24.686
FAR OUT, BABY.

55:24.754 --> 55:25.687
FAR OUT.

55:25.755 --> 55:27.188
COOL IT BOBBY, MAN.

55:27.256 --> 55:28.690
WHAT IT BE, BROTHER?

55:28.758 --> 55:31.025
YOU AIN'T GOING
WITH US, HUEY.

55:32.528 --> 55:34.462
WE'RE THE LEADERSHIP,
YOU AND ME.

55:34.530 --> 55:36.964
THERE AIN'T ENOUGH
OF US AS IT IS.

55:37.032 --> 55:39.967
THE PIGS DON'T KNOW
HOW MANY PANTHERS THERE ARE.

55:40.035 --> 55:42.437
IF BOTH OF US SHOW UP,
THEY MIGHT PUT 2 AND 2 TOGETHER.

55:42.505 --> 55:43.971
WE AIN'T EVEN 100 STRONG,

55:44.039 --> 55:45.973
BUT WE GOT THEM GUESSING
THOUSANDS.

55:46.041 --> 55:47.975
OK.
I'LL GO, YOU STAY.

55:48.043 --> 55:50.478
OH, NO.
WE TOOK A VOTE.

55:50.546 --> 55:53.481
YOU'RE TOO RISKY.
IT'S DECIDED. YOU STAY.

55:53.549 --> 55:57.685
GO ON AND MOW YOUR MAMA'S
LAWN LIKE YOU PROMISED.

55:57.753 --> 55:59.921
ALL RIGHT.

55:59.988 --> 56:02.323
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL STAY. YOU GO.

56:02.391 --> 56:03.324
JUDGE...

56:03.392 --> 56:05.359

56:05.428 --> 56:07.361
HEY, JUDGE,

56:07.430 --> 56:10.398
I SAW THE PIGS
ROUSTING YOU. YOU OK?

56:10.466 --> 56:12.834
YEAH, MAN.
IT WAS JUST HARASSMENT.

56:12.902 --> 56:15.470
MY DRIVER'S LICENSE
EXPIRED.

56:15.538 --> 56:17.972
PIGS, MAN, THEY BE
GRABBING AT ANYTHING.

56:23.546 --> 56:25.480
SO WHAT'S THE PIG'S NAME?

56:25.548 --> 56:26.481
BRIMMER.

56:26.549 --> 56:28.983
YOU GOT TO STAY COOL
ON THIS,

56:29.051 --> 56:30.485
ICY-GODDAMN-COOL.

56:30.553 --> 56:33.488
YOU JUST BECAME
THE STRONGEST WEAPON WE GOT.

56:33.556 --> 56:36.491
LET ME GUESS. THAT PIG
WANTS YOU TO CALL HIM

56:36.559 --> 56:38.493
AND TELL HIM
WHAT WE'RE DOING.

56:38.561 --> 56:39.494
YEP.

56:39.562 --> 56:41.996
YOU'RE GOING TO DO
JUST THAT,

56:42.064 --> 56:46.000
BUT I'M GOING TO TELL YOU
WHAT TO FEED THE PIG.

56:46.068 --> 56:48.002
YOU ALL RIGHT
WITH THIS?

56:48.070 --> 56:49.504
YEAH, YEAH, I GUESS.

56:49.572 --> 56:52.707
HEY, MAN, DO ANY OF
THE OTHER BROTHERS

56:52.775 --> 56:54.241

56:57.045 --> 56:58.913
SHIT'S GETTING
PRETTY THICK, HUEY.

57:01.566 --> 57:02.799
IT'S GOING TO GET

57:02.867 --> 57:04.335
A WHOLE LOT THICKER...

57:04.402 --> 57:05.769
FOR ALL OF US.

57:07.272 --> 57:08.705
WELL, ISN'T THAT NICE.

57:08.773 --> 57:10.207
WHAT EXACTLY
IS YOUR NAME?

57:10.275 --> 57:12.709
GOVERNOR, ARE YOU RUNNING
FOR THE NATIONAL TICKET?

57:12.777 --> 57:15.145
ARE YOU KIDS
ALL FROM THE SAME AREA?

57:17.415 --> 57:19.350
GOVERNOR,
WHAT ABOUT THE MULFORD ACT?

57:19.417 --> 57:22.819
I'D SAY THE SAME THING
I SAY TO ALL THE YOUTH.

57:22.887 --> 57:24.321
REMEMBER THE 3 Rs...

57:24.389 --> 57:28.225
READING, WRITING,
ARITHMETIC...

57:28.293 --> 57:30.227
AND YOU CAN BECOME
LAWYERS, DOCTORS.

57:30.295 --> 57:32.162
THAT'S WHAT AMERICA'S
ALL ABOUT.

57:32.230 --> 57:34.381
COME ON, LET'S GO.

57:39.087 --> 57:41.021
IS THIS
A MILITANT ACTION?

57:41.089 --> 57:43.023
ARE THE PANTHERS
STORMING THE CAPITOL?

57:43.091 --> 57:45.525
ABSOLUTELY NOT. WE'RE
HERE TO SEND A MESSAGE.

57:45.593 --> 57:47.170
BLACK PANTHER PARTY
CALLS UPON AMERICANS

57:47.194 --> 57:48.595
TO TAKE CAREFUL NOTE

57:48.663 --> 57:50.140
OF THE RACIST
CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE

57:50.164 --> 57:52.099
NOW CONSIDERING
THE MULFORD ACT,

57:52.166 --> 57:54.601
AIMED TO KEEP BLACK PEOPLE
DISARMED AND POWERLESS

57:54.669 --> 57:55.813
WHILE THE RACIST
POLICE AGENCIES

57:55.837 --> 57:57.104
THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY

57:57.171 --> 57:58.105
INTENSIFY THE TERROR,

57:58.172 --> 57:59.472
BRUTALITY, MURDER,
OPPRESSION

57:59.540 --> 58:00.540
OF BLACK PEOPLE.

58:00.608 --> 58:03.043
NOW I GOT A QUESTION
FOR YOU.

58:03.111 --> 58:05.045
WHICH WAY IS
THE STATE ASSEMBLY?

58:05.113 --> 58:07.547
RIGHT UP THERE
ON THE SECOND FLOOR, SIR.

58:07.615 --> 58:10.017
GOOD MAN. ALL POWER

58:59.984 --> 59:02.102
CALL THE POLICE.
CALL THE POLICE NOW.

59:02.170 --> 59:03.436
YOU GUYS CAN'T...

59:03.504 --> 59:06.439
WAIT A MINUTE, GUYS.
YOU CAN'T COME IN HERE.

59:06.507 --> 59:08.441
WE'RE HERE TO OBSERVE
THE ASSEMBLY.

59:08.509 --> 59:10.427
YOU TRYING TO DENY US
OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS?

59:13.731 --> 59:14.731
MY GOD!

59:25.410 --> 59:26.510
CALL SECURITY.

59:26.578 --> 59:28.178
DON'T SHOOT US.

59:30.415 --> 59:31.715
Radio: 29 ARMED NEGROES

59:31.782 --> 59:33.350
STORMED INTO
THE STATE CAPITOL TODAY.

59:33.418 --> 59:35.352
BOBBY SEALE,
THE BLACK PANTHER LEADER,

59:35.420 --> 59:37.354
CALLED THE NEW
ANTIGUN PROPOSAL RACIST.

59:37.422 --> 59:39.356
GOVERNOR REAGAN
HAD THIS TO SAY.

59:39.424 --> 59:42.359
Reagan: THE BLACK PANTHERS
ARE A MILITANT FRINGE GROUP

59:42.427 --> 59:44.344
WHO ARE USING FEAR
AND INTIMIDATION

59:44.412 --> 59:45.889
AGAINST THE OAKLAND
POLICE DEPARTMENT.

59:45.913 --> 59:48.348
Reporter: THE BLACK PANTHER
PARTY MADE A WRONG TURN

59:48.416 --> 59:50.851
AND ACCIDENTALLY WALKED
ONTO THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR

59:50.918 --> 59:52.853
INSTEAD OF
THE VISITORS GALLERY.

59:52.920 --> 59:54.855
THE BLACK PANTHERS
ARE NOT ANTIWHITE.

59:54.922 --> 59:55.856
WE ANTIOPPRESSION.

59:55.923 --> 59:58.375
YOU CAN'T FIGHT RACISM
WITH RACISM.

59:58.442 --> 01:00:00.310
Reporter: THE LAW
THE PANTHERS BROKE

01:00:00.378 --> 01:00:02.312
IS DISTURBING
THE ASSEMBLY.

01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:04.798
26 BLACK PANTHERS HAVE BEEN
ARRESTED IN SACRAMENTO.

01:00:04.866 --> 01:00:07.300
Judge: WE LOST BOBBY.
HE SERVED 6 MONTHS

01:00:07.368 --> 01:00:09.870
FOR TAKING
THAT WRONG TURN.

01:00:09.937 --> 01:00:11.872
THE MULFORD ACT
EVENTUALLY PASSED,

01:00:11.939 --> 01:00:14.875
SO WE LOST THE RIGHT
TO CARRY GUNS.

01:00:14.942 --> 01:00:17.878
ONE THING WE DID GET
WAS WORLDWIDE ATTENTION.

01:00:17.945 --> 01:00:20.380
YEAH, DISCIPLINED NIGGERS
MARCHING WITH GUNS,

01:00:20.447 --> 01:00:23.183
THAT GOT
EVERYBODY'S ATTENTION.

01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:31.324
THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY
FOR SELF DEFENSE

01:00:31.392 --> 01:00:34.193
CLAIMS TO BE THE VOICE
OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY.

01:00:34.261 --> 01:00:36.196
HOWEVER, ANALYSIS
OF OUR FIELD REPORT

01:00:36.264 --> 01:00:38.698
REVEALS A HIGH LEVEL
OF ORGANIZATIONAL SKILLS.

01:00:38.766 --> 01:00:40.700
WE'VE BEEN DOWN
THIS ROAD BEFORE.

01:00:40.768 --> 01:00:42.202
WHAT WE HAVE HERE

01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:44.771
IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE
OF OUTSIDE AGITATION.

01:00:44.839 --> 01:00:46.907
BLACK TERRORISTS
ON THE FLOOR

01:00:46.974 --> 01:00:48.007
OF A STATE CAPITOL?

01:00:48.075 --> 01:00:49.208
I WON'T HAVE IT.

01:00:49.276 --> 01:00:51.277
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY
AN ORGANIZATION

01:00:51.345 --> 01:00:54.280
FUNDED AND MASTERMINDED
BY SOME COMMUNIST POWER

01:00:54.348 --> 01:00:56.282
HOSTILE
TO THE UNITED STATES.

01:00:56.350 --> 01:00:58.518
THE ONLY QUESTION IS
WHICH ONE?

01:00:58.586 --> 01:01:00.454
BEFORE WE CRUSH
THESE UNGRATEFUL COONS,

01:01:00.521 --> 01:01:02.889
FIND OUT
WHO THEIR REAL BOSS IS.

01:01:02.957 --> 01:01:03.890
YES, SIR.

01:01:03.958 --> 01:01:04.958
GENTLEMEN.

01:01:17.788 --> 01:01:20.990
WE'RE GOING FOR A RIDE.
GET IN THE BACK SEAT.

01:01:21.058 --> 01:01:22.892
WE AIN'T GOT ALL DAY.

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:25.395
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
ABOUT THIS PARTY

01:01:25.463 --> 01:01:26.940
YOU BOYS WERE PLANNING
AT THE CAPITOL?

01:01:26.964 --> 01:01:28.632
THE SHIT WAS SPONTANEOUS.

01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:31.134
YOU TOLD THE PRESS.
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME.

01:01:31.202 --> 01:01:32.902
REMEMBER
WHO YOU'RE WORKING FOR.

01:01:32.970 --> 01:01:34.738
WHATEVER YOU SAY,
MAN.

01:01:34.805 --> 01:01:36.240
YOU SASSING ME?

01:01:36.307 --> 01:01:39.075
YOU LITTLE PIECE
OF SHIT!

01:01:39.277 --> 01:01:41.845
I'LL GET YOUR BLACK ASS.
SASS ME, WILL YOU?

01:01:41.913 --> 01:01:45.098
GET OUT OF
THE FUCKING CAR!

01:01:45.165 --> 01:01:47.634
"WHATEVER YOU SAY,
INSPECTOR BRIMMER."

01:01:47.702 --> 01:01:49.636
YOU'RE FUCKING RIGHT,
WHATEVER I SAY.

01:01:49.704 --> 01:01:50.637
I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE
YOUR WIRY HEAD'S

01:01:50.705 --> 01:01:51.705
SCREWED ON STRAIGHT.

01:01:51.772 --> 01:01:53.439
GET UP HERE.

01:01:53.508 --> 01:01:55.842
YOU KNOW HOW EASY
IT WOULD BE

01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:56.910
FOR YOU TO DISAPPEAR?

01:01:58.863 --> 01:02:01.714
ALL THESE DRIVERS SEE
IS A WHITE COP

01:02:01.782 --> 01:02:03.816
AND A BLACK CONVICT
IN HANDCUFFS.

01:02:03.885 --> 01:02:05.418
YOU UNDERSTAND?

01:02:05.486 --> 01:02:06.853
YEAH, WHAT
DO YOU WANT, MAN?

01:02:06.921 --> 01:02:08.788
I WANT YOU TO GET YOUR ASS
OUT OF NEUTRAL.

01:02:08.856 --> 01:02:11.291
SET THE PANTHERS
ON A PLATE FOR ME.

01:02:11.359 --> 01:02:13.426
SET THEM UP
FOR ARMED ROBBERY.

01:02:13.494 --> 01:02:14.427
THE PANTHERS
DON'T ROB NOBODY.

01:02:14.495 --> 01:02:15.428
THEY DON'T OPERATE
LIKE THAT.

01:02:15.496 --> 01:02:16.496
YOU JUST DO IT.

01:02:16.564 --> 01:02:17.998
LIKE YOUR MAN SAYS,

01:02:18.065 --> 01:02:19.666
"BY ANY MEANS
NECESSARY."

01:02:19.734 --> 01:02:22.502
OK! ALL RIGHT!
ALL RIGHT!

01:02:22.570 --> 01:02:23.570
ALL RIGHT.

01:02:25.372 --> 01:02:26.806
SOMETHING
FOR YOUR TUITION.

01:02:26.874 --> 01:02:29.442
GET BACK
IN THE FUCKING CAR.

01:02:32.530 --> 01:02:33.964
WHAT'S HAPPENING, BRO?

01:02:34.032 --> 01:02:36.967
WHERE'S JUDGE? I AIN'T
SEEN HIM AROUND LATELY.

01:02:37.035 --> 01:02:39.970
BETWEEN SCHOOL, HIS JOB,
AND THE PANTHERS,

01:02:40.038 --> 01:02:42.472
HE'S BEEN RUNNING
KIND OF RAW.

01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:45.075
I GOT TO TAKE A LEAK.

01:02:46.577 --> 01:02:47.844
HEY!

01:02:47.912 --> 01:02:51.064
I KNOW THIS FOOL AIN'T SELLING
DRUGS IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:02:51.132 --> 01:02:52.609
GO ON. USE MY PAD.
LET ME HANDLE THIS.

01:02:52.633 --> 01:02:55.235
I'VE BEEN KICKING HIS
ASS SINCE HIGH SCHOOL.

01:02:55.303 --> 01:02:59.039
I'LL SEE YOU OUT AT
THE MEETING, ALL RIGHT?

01:02:59.106 --> 01:03:01.174
WHAT DO YOU GOT
TO SELL?

01:03:01.242 --> 01:03:03.376
EVERY BLACK MAN
AIN'T A DOPE DEALER.

01:03:03.444 --> 01:03:06.079
WHAT DID HE MEAN
BY THAT?

01:03:06.147 --> 01:03:08.198
I TOLD YOU FOR THE LAST
TIME, STOP PUSHING

01:03:08.265 --> 01:03:09.833
THAT FUCKING POISON
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD!

01:03:09.901 --> 01:03:12.535
YOU'RE POISONING
YOUR OWN PEOPLE, FOOL!

01:03:12.603 --> 01:03:15.271
FUCK THAT
BLACK POWER SHIT!

01:03:15.339 --> 01:03:17.774
I'M DOWN WITH GREEN
POWER AND FUCK YOU!

01:03:17.842 --> 01:03:19.375
FUCK YOU, ALL RIGHT?

01:03:19.443 --> 01:03:21.878
DON'T MAKE ME COME
BACK HERE, ALL RIGHT?

01:03:21.946 --> 01:03:23.279
ALL RIGHT?

01:03:23.347 --> 01:03:26.449
♪ LET'S STRAIGHTEN IT OUT ♪

01:03:28.119 --> 01:03:29.552

01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:33.990
♪ LET'S STRAIGHTEN
IT OUT... ♪

01:03:34.058 --> 01:03:35.658
CY, IS THAT YOU?

01:03:35.727 --> 01:03:38.595
I'LL BE OUT
IN A MINUTE, MAN.

01:03:48.639 --> 01:03:50.841
HEY, HEY, HEY.

01:03:50.908 --> 01:03:53.777
OFFICER, I WAS...
I WASN'T DOING NOTHING.

01:03:53.845 --> 01:03:55.278
COME HERE. COME HERE.

01:03:55.346 --> 01:03:58.081
PANTHERS TURNED INTO SOME
REAL SHITHEELS, AIN'T THEY?

01:03:58.149 --> 01:04:00.751
YES, SIR. THEY'RE GETTING
ALL HIGH AND MIGHTY.

01:04:00.818 --> 01:04:02.252
IF THIS
WAS MY NEIGHBORHOOD,

01:04:02.319 --> 01:04:04.154
I'D STAND UP
FOR MYSELF,

01:04:04.222 --> 01:04:06.656
IF YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.

01:04:06.724 --> 01:04:08.725
YES, SIR.

01:04:22.373 --> 01:04:25.809
SAW THE PIGS ROUSTING
YOU, MAN. YOU OK?

01:04:25.877 --> 01:04:27.811
Judge: YEAH, MAN.
IT WAS JUST HARASSMENT.

01:04:27.879 --> 01:04:29.746
MY DRIVER'S LICENSE
EXPIRED.

01:04:29.814 --> 01:04:30.747
YEAH, RIGHT.

01:04:30.815 --> 01:04:35.351
Huey: ALL RIGHT, Y'ALL,
LOOK AROUND YOU.

01:04:35.419 --> 01:04:37.453
WE GOT NEW MEMBERS
JOINING EVERY DAY.

01:04:37.521 --> 01:04:39.956
NEWLY APPOINTED MEMBERS
FROM OUR NEWARK CHAPTER

01:04:40.024 --> 01:04:41.758
VISITING FROM THE EAST,
STAND.

01:04:44.896 --> 01:04:48.498
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE
ANOTHER NEW MEMBER TO YOU...

01:04:48.565 --> 01:04:51.968
THE AUTHOR OF SOUL ON ICE
AND A RESPECTED JOURNALIST.

01:04:52.036 --> 01:04:54.971
I'M PROUD TO INTRODUCE
OUR NEW MINISTER OF INFORMATION,

01:04:55.039 --> 01:04:56.039
ELDRIDGE CLEAVER.

01:05:00.845 --> 01:05:03.046
YOU'RE ALL WELL AWARE
OF THE CHAINS

01:05:03.114 --> 01:05:04.815
THAT WE AS A PEOPLE BEAR...

01:05:04.882 --> 01:05:09.219
THE CHAINS OF SLAVERY,
OF SECOND-CLASS CITIZENSHIP.

01:05:09.287 --> 01:05:11.855
BUT THERE ARE OTHER
MORE INVISIBLE CHAINS...

01:05:11.923 --> 01:05:14.357
CHAINS OF NOT
SPEAKING YOUR MIND,

01:05:14.425 --> 01:05:16.793
CHAINS OF ALL THE WORDS
LEFT UNSAID

01:05:16.994 --> 01:05:19.362
OUT OF FEAR OF REPRISAL
BY THE MAN,

01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:23.967
THE SILENCING
OF OUR BLACK VOICES.

01:05:24.035 --> 01:05:27.470
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU
WE HAVE A VOICE, DIG IT?

01:05:27.538 --> 01:05:28.471
THAT'S RIGHT.

01:05:28.539 --> 01:05:30.373
I'D LIKE
TO PROVE IT TO YOU.

01:05:32.376 --> 01:05:34.244
EVERYBODY
REPEAT AFTER ME.

01:05:37.281 --> 01:05:38.581
FUCK RONALD REAGAN.

01:05:46.373 --> 01:05:48.141
I'M SERIOUS.

01:05:48.209 --> 01:05:49.642
FUCK RONALD REAGAN.

01:05:49.710 --> 01:05:51.878
FUCK RONALD REAGAN.

01:05:51.946 --> 01:05:53.246
FUCK RONALD REAGAN.

01:05:53.313 --> 01:05:55.148
FUCK RONALD REAGAN.

FEEL GOOD, DON'T IT?

01:06:16.436 --> 01:06:18.938
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.

01:06:19.006 --> 01:06:21.941
AMAZING HOW SPEAKING YOUR MIND
CAN FREE YOUR SOUL.

01:06:22.009 --> 01:06:23.843
THANK YOU,
BROTHER ELDRIDGE,

01:06:23.911 --> 01:06:25.344
MINISTER OF INFORMATION.

01:06:25.412 --> 01:06:26.579
SISTER, HEY.

01:06:26.647 --> 01:06:27.780
WAS YOU PAYING
ATTENTION?

01:06:27.848 --> 01:06:29.548
THE PIGS MUST HAVE
PLANTED HER

01:06:29.617 --> 01:06:31.884
SO THEY COULD
BUST US.

01:06:31.952 --> 01:06:33.886
I'LL HANDLE THIS.

01:06:33.954 --> 01:06:35.722
I'M OK.
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

01:06:35.789 --> 01:06:37.724
COME ON, SISTER,
LET'S GO.

01:06:37.791 --> 01:06:39.726
AND REPORT
TO YOUR CADRE LEADER.

01:06:39.793 --> 01:06:43.229
DON'T FORGET WE GOT
OUR RED BOOK HERE ON SALE.

01:06:43.296 --> 01:06:45.131
EACH ONE TEACH ONE.

01:06:45.198 --> 01:06:48.467
WE'VE GOT TO REACH OUT
TO OUR BROTHERS ON THE STREET.

01:06:48.535 --> 01:06:51.470
THAT'S WHAT THE 10-POINT
PROGRAM IS ALL ABOUT.

01:06:51.538 --> 01:06:53.973
BROTHER HUEY,
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

01:06:54.041 --> 01:06:55.041
YEAH, CERTAINLY.

01:06:56.043 --> 01:06:56.976
ALONE.

01:06:57.044 --> 01:06:58.477
NOT RIGHT NOW,
BROTHER.

01:06:58.545 --> 01:06:59.979
I'M TALKING
SOME BUSINESS

01:07:00.047 --> 01:07:01.981
WITH THE MINISTER
OF INFORMATION.

01:07:02.049 --> 01:07:03.049
TOMORROW. TOMORROW.

01:07:03.117 --> 01:07:07.954
OK, SO, I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S EXACTLY...

01:07:15.896 --> 01:07:18.297
CAN'T YOU SEE YOU'RE
JEOPARDIZING THE MOVEMENT?

01:07:18.365 --> 01:07:21.467
THE PIGS ARE LOOKING FOR ANY
EXCUSE TO COME DOWN ON US.

01:07:21.535 --> 01:07:24.470
I DON'T WANT MY BABY
TO BE NO JUNKIE.

01:07:24.538 --> 01:07:26.773
I WANT MY BABY
TO BE FREE.

01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:28.908
THAT'S WHAT WE ALL WANT.

01:07:28.976 --> 01:07:31.911
YOU AIN'T GOING
TO HURT ME, IS YOU?

01:07:31.979 --> 01:07:33.612
YOU'RE HURTING YOURSELF

01:07:33.681 --> 01:07:36.082
AND THAT BABY, TOO.

01:07:37.417 --> 01:07:40.352
SISTER, YOU GOT
TO STOP KILLING US.

01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:42.789
YOU GOT TO STOP
KILLING THAT CHILD.

01:07:45.793 --> 01:07:47.060
Huey: JUDGE,
YOUR INFORMATION

01:07:47.127 --> 01:07:48.527
IS VITAL TO US, MAN.

01:07:48.595 --> 01:07:50.529
HOW VITAL
COULD IT BE, MAN?

01:07:50.597 --> 01:07:52.531
WE GOT CHAPTERS
ALL OVER NOW.

01:07:52.599 --> 01:07:54.533
THIS IS PANTHER
INTERNATIONAL HEADQUARTERS.

01:07:54.601 --> 01:07:56.412
THE POLICE WILL START
RUNNING GAMES HERE FIRST.

01:07:56.436 --> 01:07:58.370
WHO'LL STRAIGHTEN OUT
THE OTHER BROTHERS

01:07:58.438 --> 01:08:00.707
WHEN THEY GET ON MY ASS?

01:08:00.774 --> 01:08:02.208
LIKE THE MANUAL
SAYS,

01:08:02.275 --> 01:08:03.710
"INFORMATION
IS DISSEMINATED...

01:08:03.777 --> 01:08:05.011
ON A NEED-TO-KNOW
BASIS."

01:08:08.015 --> 01:08:10.850
HERE'S ANOTHER DONATION
FROM THE PIGS.

01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:15.361
WE GOT TO LET
THE BROTHERS KNOW

01:17:15.428 --> 01:17:16.862
WHAT WE'RE ABOUT
OURSELVES.

01:17:16.929 --> 01:17:19.231
THAT'S WHAT
OUR NEWSPAPER WILL DO.

01:17:19.299 --> 01:17:21.733
A LOT OF BROTHERS
DON'T READ. DIG?

01:17:21.801 --> 01:17:24.203
WE GOT TO GIVE THEM
A STRONGER IMAGE.

01:17:24.271 --> 01:17:26.705
TYRONE, GET YOUR ASS
IN HERE.

01:17:26.773 --> 01:17:29.708
THIS PICTURE WILL BE
WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS.

01:17:29.776 --> 01:17:32.878
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT PEACE
AND FREEDOM PARTY THING?

01:17:32.945 --> 01:17:35.381
THEY REALLY WANT
TO HOOK UP WITH US.

01:17:35.448 --> 01:17:37.749
WE'VE BEEN INVITED
TO THEIR RALLY.

01:17:37.817 --> 01:17:39.718
WHAT DOES
BROTHER JAMAL THINK?

01:17:39.786 --> 01:17:42.721
I THINK POOR BLACK FOLKS
ARE FIGHTING FOR THEIR HUMANITY

01:17:42.789 --> 01:17:45.724
AND POOR WHITE FOLKS ARE
FIGHTING FOR MORE MONEY.

01:17:45.792 --> 01:17:48.727
WHITE BOYS CAN GET A HAIRCUT
AND JOIN THE ESTABLISHMENT,

01:17:48.795 --> 01:17:51.730
BUT US...
WE'RE BLACK FOREVER.

01:17:51.798 --> 01:17:53.666
SISTER ALMA,
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS.

01:17:53.733 --> 01:17:56.068
THE FBI's LEANING ON OUR PRINTER

01:17:56.135 --> 01:17:58.804
LOOKING FOR AN EXCUSE
TO CANCEL THE CONTRACT.

01:17:58.871 --> 01:18:00.783
DEADLINE FOR THE NEXT ISSUE
OF THE PAPER IS TOMORROW.

01:18:00.807 --> 01:18:04.726
CIRCULATION IS UP...
125,000 AND RISING.

01:18:04.794 --> 01:18:06.262
WE'RE SEIZING THE TIME.

01:18:06.330 --> 01:18:08.764
THE TIME IS WHAT
SARTRE CALLED

01:18:08.832 --> 01:18:11.667
THE MOMENT THE MATCH
IS PUT TO THE FUSE.

01:18:11.734 --> 01:18:13.269
NOW, IS THE HAND
HOLDING THE MATCH

01:18:13.337 --> 01:18:14.603
BLACK OR WHITE?

01:18:14.671 --> 01:18:16.689
ALL RIGHT.
NO FULL-FLEDGED ALLIANCE,

01:18:16.756 --> 01:18:19.425
BUT WE WILL ACCEPT
THE RALLY INVITATION.

01:18:19.726 --> 01:18:20.776
RIGHT ON.

01:18:20.978 --> 01:18:22.845
BROTHER ELDRIDGE,
SET IT UP.

01:18:22.912 --> 01:18:25.581
LOOK LIKE A WARRIOR.

01:18:26.850 --> 01:18:28.550
HELL, NO! WE WON'T GO!

01:18:28.618 --> 01:18:30.519
HELL, NO! WE WON'T GO!

01:18:30.587 --> 01:18:31.787
HELL, NO! WE WON'T GO!

01:18:31.989 --> 01:18:33.856
A FEW DAYS AGO,

01:18:33.923 --> 01:18:38.026
WE CAME TO THESE STEPS
TO PROTEST.

01:18:38.094 --> 01:18:40.863
WE WERE 4,000 THEN,

01:18:40.930 --> 01:18:43.366
AND THE COPS
BEAT US DOWN.

01:18:45.836 --> 01:18:47.370
TODAY...

01:18:47.437 --> 01:18:50.205
WE ARE 10,000!

01:18:55.462 --> 01:18:59.898
10,000 DIFFERENT VOICES
IN UNISON

01:18:59.966 --> 01:19:01.166
SAYING ONE THING...

01:19:02.402 --> 01:19:06.655
THAT YOU CANNOT HAVE
AN IMPERIALISTIC WAR ABROAD

01:19:06.723 --> 01:19:09.324
AND SOCIAL PEACE AT HOME.

01:19:09.393 --> 01:19:11.326
SUSPECT JUMPED
THE BACKYARD FENCE,

01:19:11.395 --> 01:19:12.675
HEADING EAST
ON MARKET STREET.

01:19:12.729 --> 01:19:13.979
IN PURSUIT.

01:19:14.046 --> 01:19:18.016
SO IT IS WITH THIS UNITY,
THIS PURPOSE, IN MIND,

01:19:18.084 --> 01:19:19.151
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN...

01:19:19.218 --> 01:19:21.320
HE'S CUTTING
THROUGH THE PARK.

01:19:21.388 --> 01:19:23.839
DEFENSE MINISTER
OF THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY...

01:19:23.907 --> 01:19:25.240
HUEY NEWTON.

01:19:25.308 --> 01:19:27.009
HUEY! HUEY!

01:19:27.076 --> 01:19:28.677
HUEY! HUEY!

01:19:28.745 --> 01:19:30.362
HUEY! HUEY!

01:19:30.430 --> 01:19:32.481
HUEY! HUEY!

01:19:32.549 --> 01:19:35.551
THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY'S
PROUD TO BE HERE TODAY.

01:19:36.936 --> 01:19:38.737
NOT FAR FROM HERE,

01:19:39.172 --> 01:19:41.039
BROTHER BOBBY SEALE'S
LOCKED DOWN...

01:19:42.992 --> 01:19:46.695
A VICTIM OF THE TYRANNY
WE FEEL HERE AT HOME.

01:19:46.763 --> 01:19:49.881
THAT SAME TYRANNY
IS AT WORK

01:19:49.949 --> 01:19:52.618
MANY THOUSANDS OF MILES
FROM HERE IN VIETNAM.

01:19:53.953 --> 01:19:55.454
THANKS A LOT,
ASSHOLE.

01:19:55.522 --> 01:19:58.256
THAT "BLIND MAN"
THING WAS REAL CUTE.

01:19:58.325 --> 01:20:01.193
THE ONLY QUESTION
YOU CAN ASK IS...

01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:02.528
I GOT HIM.
THANK YOU, GUYS.

01:20:02.595 --> 01:20:04.530
WHY SHOULD THE BLACK MAN

01:20:04.597 --> 01:20:07.933
GO FIGHT THE YELLOW MAN
FOR THE WHITE MAN?

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.435
THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY

01:20:09.502 --> 01:20:12.521
IS OPPOSED TO THE WAR
IN VIETNAM.

01:20:14.974 --> 01:20:17.910
WE KNOW OUR WAR
IS HERE AT HOME

01:20:17.977 --> 01:20:20.579
AGAINST HARD DRUGS
IN THE COMMUNITY,

01:20:20.646 --> 01:20:23.348
AGAINST UNEMPLOYMENT.

01:20:23.416 --> 01:20:26.518
THAT, BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
IS OUR WAR.

01:20:26.586 --> 01:20:27.953
POWER TO THE PEOPLE!

01:20:28.021 --> 01:20:29.788
POWER TO THE PEOPLE!

01:20:29.856 --> 01:20:31.623
POWER TO THE PEOPLE!

01:20:31.691 --> 01:20:32.725
POWER TO THE PEOPLE!

01:20:32.792 --> 01:20:33.609
POWER TO THE PEOPLE!

01:20:33.676 --> 01:20:34.676
POWER TO THE PEOPLE!

01:20:34.711 --> 01:20:35.844
POWER TO THE PEOPLE!

01:20:35.912 --> 01:20:37.079
POWER TO THE PEOPLE!

01:20:37.147 --> 01:20:38.514
POWER TO THE PEOPLE!

01:20:38.582 --> 01:20:39.681
POWER TO THE PEOPLE!

01:20:39.749 --> 01:20:40.849
POWER TO THE PEOPLE!

01:20:40.917 --> 01:20:42.184
HELL, NO!
WE WON'T GO!

01:20:42.252 --> 01:20:43.352
HELL, NO!
WE WON'T GO!

01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:45.254
HELL, NO!
WE WON'T GO!

01:20:45.322 --> 01:20:46.855
HELL, NO!
WE WON'T GO!

01:20:46.923 --> 01:20:48.190
HELL, NO!
WE WON'T GO!

01:20:48.258 --> 01:20:49.558
WHAT THE HELL'S THIS?

01:20:49.626 --> 01:20:50.559
INSPECTOR BRIMMER,

01:20:50.627 --> 01:20:54.296
COULD YOU COME
IN HERE A MINUTE?

01:20:54.364 --> 01:20:55.797
WHAT'S GOING ON, CHARLIE?

01:20:55.865 --> 01:20:57.699
THE FEDS...
THEY'RE MOVING IN.

01:20:57.767 --> 01:20:58.867
OH, LORD.

01:20:58.935 --> 01:21:00.402
COME ON, GUYS,
LET'S GO.

01:21:15.385 --> 01:21:17.186
HAVE A SEAT, INSPECTOR,
PLEASE.

01:21:19.389 --> 01:21:21.089
GENTLEMEN,
THIS IS PRUITT.

01:21:21.158 --> 01:21:23.992
HE'LL BE WORKING WITH US
FROM HERE ON IN.

01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:25.427
BUT... BUT ISN'T HE...

01:21:25.495 --> 01:21:27.496
SPECIAL PEOPLE
FOR SPECIAL PROBLEMS.

01:21:27.564 --> 01:21:29.265
I DIDN'T KNOW
THE FBI HAD...

01:21:29.332 --> 01:21:31.433
THERE ARE MANY THINGS
YOU DON'T KNOW.

01:21:31.501 --> 01:21:33.835
SHALL WE GET
TO THE POINT?

01:21:33.903 --> 01:21:35.971
THE BLACK PANTHERS
HAVE UNITED

01:21:36.039 --> 01:21:38.840
WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS
SPONSORED BY THE COMMUNISTS

01:21:38.908 --> 01:21:41.343
TO UNDERMINE OUR EFFORTS
IN VIETNAM.

01:21:41.411 --> 01:21:43.845
IN THE OPINION
OF MR. HOOVER,

01:21:43.913 --> 01:21:46.482
THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY
IS PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE.

01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:48.484
THEY HAVE, QUITE SIMPLY,

01:21:48.552 --> 01:21:51.320
GUARANTEED
THEIR OWN EXTINCTION.

01:21:51.388 --> 01:21:52.488
JESUS.

01:21:52.556 --> 01:21:54.356
I DON'T EVEN
NEED TO SAY

01:21:54.424 --> 01:21:56.858
YOUR DEPARTMENT'S HANDLING
OF THE BLACK PANTHERS...

01:21:56.926 --> 01:21:58.171
IN PARTICULAR,
INSPECTOR BRIMMER'S

01:21:58.195 --> 01:21:59.628
SO-CALLED
UNDERCOVER OPERATION...

01:21:59.696 --> 01:22:02.097
HAS BEEN
A COMPLETE TRAVESTY.

01:22:04.367 --> 01:22:07.035
MEMO FROM
THE COMMISSIONER, ET CETERA,

01:22:07.103 --> 01:22:08.504
BACKING
MR. HOOVER'S DECISION

01:22:08.572 --> 01:22:10.506
TO PLACE
THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY

01:22:10.574 --> 01:22:12.007
AND THEIR
SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES

01:22:12.075 --> 01:22:14.310
UNDER THE FULL JURISDICTION
OF THE BUREAU.

01:22:20.099 --> 01:22:21.766
MOVE IT!

01:22:21.835 --> 01:22:24.119
MOVE! MOVE!
MOVE! MOVE!

01:22:25.555 --> 01:22:27.033
Kathleen Cleaver: THIS PATTERN
OF HARASSMENT

01:22:27.057 --> 01:22:29.825
IS GOING ON AGAINST
THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY

01:22:29.893 --> 01:22:31.326
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

01:22:31.394 --> 01:22:34.329
ON FRIDAY, THE WATTS OFFICE
OF THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY

01:22:34.397 --> 01:22:35.998
WAS BOMBED
AND DEMOLISHED.

01:22:36.066 --> 01:22:39.001
LAST WEEK, THE DES MOINES
OFFICE WAS BOMBED.

01:22:39.069 --> 01:22:41.704
THIS WEEK THEY RAIDED
THE SAN FRANCISCO OFFICE.

01:22:41.771 --> 01:22:43.205
THEY SHOOT US,

01:22:43.272 --> 01:22:44.673
SHOOT TEAR GAS
IN OUR OFFICE,

01:22:44.741 --> 01:22:47.977
AND DRAG PEOPLE
OFF TO JAIL.

01:23:09.866 --> 01:23:11.800
PHYSICALLY
YOU LOOK BLACK,

01:23:11.868 --> 01:23:14.803
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU ARE.

01:23:14.871 --> 01:23:17.572
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE FROM.

01:23:17.641 --> 01:23:20.308
YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN A SLAVE NAME
AND A SLAVE MENTALITY.

01:23:20.644 --> 01:23:23.128
A SLAVE HATES HISSELF,
HATES HIS SKIN.

01:23:23.196 --> 01:23:25.563
A SLAVE HATES
HIS NATURAL KINKY HAIR.

01:23:25.631 --> 01:23:28.901
GIVE A GUN TO A SLAVE,
HE'LL KILL HIS BROTHER.

01:23:28.968 --> 01:23:31.320
HOW LONG ARE YOU
GOING TO CRY

01:23:31.388 --> 01:23:32.821
AND BLAME
YOUR OPPRESSOR

01:23:32.889 --> 01:23:35.190
BEFORE YOU GET UP
OFF YOUR KNEES

01:23:35.258 --> 01:23:36.992
AND DO IT
YOUR GODDAMN SELF?

01:23:37.327 --> 01:23:38.977
KNOW THE 10 POINTS.

01:23:39.045 --> 01:23:41.346
IF YOU DON'T,
YOU DO NOT KNOW

01:23:41.414 --> 01:23:43.415
WHAT YOU'RE LIVING
AND DYING FOR.

01:23:43.482 --> 01:23:44.416
Fred Hampton: YOU GOT
TO MAKE A DECISION,

01:23:44.483 --> 01:23:47.019
STAND UP AGAINST THE PIGS.

01:23:47.086 --> 01:23:49.688
THAT'S WHAT
THE PANTHERS ARE DOING HERE,

01:23:49.756 --> 01:23:52.608
THEY CAN DO ANYTHING
THEY WANT TO TO US.

01:23:52.676 --> 01:23:54.026
I AM...

01:23:54.028 --> 01:23:55.028
A REVOLUTIONARY.

01:23:55.912 --> 01:23:58.363
AFTER THAT GOOD DOCTOR
IS GONE,

01:23:58.431 --> 01:24:00.799
THERE'LL NEVER BE
ANOTHER BLACK MESSIAH

01:24:00.866 --> 01:24:02.284
UNLESS WE CREATE HIM.

01:24:02.352 --> 01:24:03.819
WHAT'S
YOUR NAME, BOY?

01:24:03.886 --> 01:24:04.953
5.

01:24:05.021 --> 01:24:06.488
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

01:24:06.556 --> 01:24:08.223
WHAT'S YOUR NAME,
PUNK?

01:24:08.291 --> 01:24:09.474
I SAID, 5.

01:24:09.542 --> 01:24:11.710
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

01:24:11.778 --> 01:24:13.311
WHAT'S WITH
THE NAME?

01:24:13.379 --> 01:24:16.314
I KEEP SAYING 5,
LIKE THE FIFTH AMENDMENT,

01:24:16.382 --> 01:24:18.249
AND THIS COP'S
GETTING PISSED.

01:24:18.317 --> 01:24:21.219
THERE AIN'T MUCH
HE CAN DO TO ME

01:24:21.287 --> 01:24:23.822
SO HE GIVE ME
A TICKET FOR LITTERING

01:24:23.890 --> 01:24:26.825
ON ACCOUNT OF THE PAPER
HE RIPPED OUT OF MY HAND.

01:24:26.893 --> 01:24:29.828
THEY CAN'T DO TOO MUCH
WITH THAT MANY EYES ON THEM.

01:24:29.896 --> 01:24:31.797
THEY AIN'T NOTHING
BUT RACIST COPS.

01:24:33.633 --> 01:24:35.067
SHIT.

01:24:40.907 --> 01:24:42.340
WELL, WELL, WELL.

01:24:42.408 --> 01:24:45.577
IF IT ISN'T THE GREAT
HUEY P. NEWTON.

01:24:45.645 --> 01:24:47.079
LICENSE
AND REGISTRATION.

01:25:24.984 --> 01:25:26.518
GET OUT OF THE CAR.

01:25:26.585 --> 01:25:28.145
CALIFORNIA LAW DOES NOT
REQUIRE A DRIVER

01:25:28.187 --> 01:25:29.420
TO LEAVE A VEHICLE.

01:25:29.488 --> 01:25:30.922
OUT OF THE FUCKING CAR!

01:25:30.990 --> 01:25:33.291
YOU GOT A PROBLEM
WITH ENGLISH, BOY?

01:25:35.394 --> 01:25:36.762
YOU, TOO.

01:25:36.829 --> 01:25:38.363
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM,
OFFICER?

01:25:38.665 --> 01:25:39.848
I'M NOT
RESISTING ARREST,

01:25:39.916 --> 01:25:41.082
NOR AM I ARMED.

01:25:41.150 --> 01:25:44.219
ANY USE OF FORCE
ON YOUR PART IS ILLEGAL.

01:25:44.287 --> 01:25:46.221
LET'S GO
FOR A WALK.

01:25:46.289 --> 01:25:47.723
AM I UNDER ARREST?

01:25:47.791 --> 01:25:49.792
AM I UNDER ARREST?

01:25:49.859 --> 01:25:52.594
AM I UNDER ARREST?

01:25:54.497 --> 01:25:55.731
HUEY!

01:25:55.799 --> 01:25:57.132
OH, MY GOD!

01:26:02.806 --> 01:26:04.139
SON OF A...

01:26:06.943 --> 01:26:09.878
THIS DOCTOR IS ALL
PREPARED FOR SURGERY.

01:26:09.946 --> 01:26:12.280
HE HAS INTERNAL BLEEDING.

01:26:12.348 --> 01:26:15.417
OK, WHAT HAVE
WE GOT HERE?

01:26:15.485 --> 01:26:16.819
GUNSHOTS...
MULTIPLE.

01:26:16.886 --> 01:26:19.588
GET OUT OF THE WAY!

01:26:19.656 --> 01:26:21.824
BACK OFF!
THAT'S A COP KILLER.

01:26:21.891 --> 01:26:24.760
YOU KILLED A COP, BOY!

01:26:29.131 --> 01:26:30.732
GET THEM
OUT OF HERE!

01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:32.835
GET BACK!

01:26:56.893 --> 01:26:58.760
ALL RIGHT.
MOVE IT NOW.

01:27:06.068 --> 01:27:07.135
COME ON.

01:27:08.404 --> 01:27:09.771
STAY STRONG,
MY BROTHER.

01:27:13.075 --> 01:27:15.377
POWER TO THE PEOPLE,
BOBBY.

01:27:19.081 --> 01:27:20.749
RIGHT ON, MAN.

01:27:36.599 --> 01:27:38.000
ALL RIGHT, MAN,

01:27:38.067 --> 01:27:39.187
DON'T LET THEM
BREAK YOU.

01:27:41.771 --> 01:27:43.204
WHERE'S THE LAWYER?

01:27:43.272 --> 01:27:44.706
RIGHT DOWN THERE.

01:27:44.774 --> 01:27:46.875
CAN HE FREE HUEY?

01:27:46.943 --> 01:27:49.377
IF ANYBODY CAN,
HE'S THE MAN.

01:27:49.445 --> 01:27:50.746
WHERE'S HE AT?

01:27:54.284 --> 01:27:56.851
IT'S GOING TO WORK.

01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:59.554
JUST MAKE SURE THE FOCUS
STAYS ON FREEING HUEY.

01:28:01.674 --> 01:28:04.142
WE CAN'T MAKE ENOUGH
OF THESE THINGS.

01:28:04.210 --> 01:28:06.611
WE GOT MOVIE STARS
CALLING UP TO HELP.

01:28:06.679 --> 01:28:09.014
BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
IT'S NATION TIME.

01:28:09.081 --> 01:28:11.516
I WISH WE DIDN'T
NEED THESE BUTTONS.

01:28:11.583 --> 01:28:13.518
I WISH
HUEY WAS HERE.

01:28:13.585 --> 01:28:14.686
ME, TOO.

01:28:14.753 --> 01:28:17.189
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT,
MY BROTHER?

01:28:17.256 --> 01:28:18.690
LOOK AT THIS.

01:28:18.757 --> 01:28:20.692
Judge: YOU COULD JAIL
A REVOLUTIONARY,

01:28:20.759 --> 01:28:23.028
BUT YOU COULDN'T
JAIL THE REVOLUTION.

01:28:23.095 --> 01:28:25.363
DESPITE THE PIGS
AND THE FBI,

01:28:25.431 --> 01:28:27.232
OUR POWER BASE
IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY

01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:29.367
CONTINUED TO GROW.

01:28:29.435 --> 01:28:30.869
EVEN MOM CAME AROUND.

01:28:30.937 --> 01:28:32.070
WELL?

01:28:32.138 --> 01:28:33.538
SERIOUS NOW.

01:28:33.605 --> 01:28:36.141
I COME OUT
OF THAT WIG.

01:28:40.213 --> 01:28:42.047
ELDRIDGE,
COME MEET MY MOTHER.

01:28:42.114 --> 01:28:44.716
MA, THIS
IS ELDRIDGE CLEAVER.

01:28:44.783 --> 01:28:47.485
ELDRIDGE CLEAVER,
THIS IS MY MOTHER.

01:28:47.553 --> 01:28:50.222
HERE'S THE GUY
I TOLD YOU ABOUT.

01:28:50.289 --> 01:28:51.957
BE PROUD
OF YOUR SON.

01:28:52.024 --> 01:28:53.458
SAY IT LOUD...

01:28:53.525 --> 01:28:55.126
I'M BLACK,
AND I'M PROUD.

01:28:55.194 --> 01:28:57.896
Judge: EVERYTHING IN HERE...

01:28:57.964 --> 01:29:00.332
BUTTER, SALT, GREASE...

01:29:00.399 --> 01:29:02.334
YOU ARE
THE MALNUTRITION PANTHER,

01:29:02.401 --> 01:29:03.935
THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE.

01:29:04.003 --> 01:29:06.437
Y'ALL NEED
TO BE EATING MORE.

01:29:06.505 --> 01:29:08.340
RUNNING AROUND HERE
LIKE SCARECROWS.

01:29:08.407 --> 01:29:10.842
YOU DON'T EAT,
YOU DON'T SLEEP.

01:29:10.910 --> 01:29:13.345
TAKE THIS HAT OFF
AT THE TABLE.

01:29:13.412 --> 01:29:14.846
AIN'T NO WAY TO LIVE.

01:29:14.914 --> 01:29:16.348
IT'S GOOD
TO BE SKINNY...

01:29:16.415 --> 01:29:18.350
EASIER TO RUN
FROM FAT PIGS.

01:29:18.417 --> 01:29:21.353
WE BRING YOU
THE FOLLOWING SPECIAL REPORT.

01:29:21.420 --> 01:29:24.322
MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.
WAS KILLED TONIGHT IN MEMPHIS,

01:29:24.390 --> 01:29:26.358
SHOT IN THE FACE
AS HE STOOD ALONE

01:29:26.425 --> 01:29:28.860
ON THE BALCONY
OF HIS HOTEL ROOM.

01:29:28.928 --> 01:29:30.762
HE DIED IN A HOSPITAL
AN HOUR LATER.

01:29:30.829 --> 01:29:32.764
LAST NIGHT,
HE SAID THIS...

01:29:32.831 --> 01:29:34.866
King: I JUST WANT
TO DO GOD'S WILL.

01:29:34.934 --> 01:29:36.701
HE NEVER
HURT NOBODY.

01:29:36.769 --> 01:29:40.038
HE HAS ALLOWED ME TO GO
UP TO THE MOUNTAIN,

01:29:40.106 --> 01:29:42.374
AND I'VE LOOKED OVER

01:29:42.441 --> 01:29:46.378
AND I'VE SEEN
THE PROMISED LAND.

01:29:46.445 --> 01:29:48.880
I MAY NOT
GET THERE WITH YOU,

01:29:48.948 --> 01:29:51.783
BUT I WANT YOU
TO KNOW TONIGHT

01:29:51.850 --> 01:29:53.885
THAT WE AS A PEOPLE

01:29:53.953 --> 01:29:56.288
WILL GET
TO THE PROMISED LAND.

01:29:58.457 --> 01:30:00.325
SO I AM HAPPY TONIGHT.

01:30:00.393 --> 01:30:02.827
I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT ANYTHING.

01:30:02.895 --> 01:30:04.996
I'M NOT FEARING ANY MAN.

01:30:05.064 --> 01:30:07.498
MINE EYES
HAVE SEEN THE GLORY

01:30:07.566 --> 01:30:09.935
OF THE COMING
OF THE LORD.

01:30:15.607 --> 01:30:18.343
♪ HEY, JOE ♪

01:30:18.411 --> 01:30:19.945
♪ A-WHERE YOU GOIN' ♪

01:30:20.012 --> 01:30:21.712
♪ WITH THAT GUN
IN YOUR HAND? ♪

01:30:21.780 --> 01:30:23.581
Judge: WHEN KING'S MESSAGE
OF NONVIOLENCE

01:30:23.649 --> 01:30:25.850
ENDED
IN HIS VIOLENT DEATH,

01:30:25.918 --> 01:30:27.352
FOLKS FINALLY REALIZED

01:30:27.420 --> 01:30:30.422
THAT THEY COULDN'T
PRAY THEIR WAY TO FREEDOM...

01:30:30.489 --> 01:30:33.425
JUST WHAT THE PANTHERS
HAD SAID ALL ALONG.

01:30:33.492 --> 01:30:35.026
AMERICA WAS BURNING.

01:30:35.094 --> 01:30:39.130
NATIONWIDE, OUR ENROLLMENT
DOUBLED IN 2 WEEKS.

01:30:39.198 --> 01:30:41.132
NO, NO.
NO MORE WORDS!

01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:42.633
NO MORE WORDS.

01:30:42.701 --> 01:30:44.135
NO MORE SITTING.

01:30:44.203 --> 01:30:45.636
NO MORE PRAYING,

01:30:45.704 --> 01:30:48.139
WAITING FOR THE PIGS
TO KILL US.

01:30:48.207 --> 01:30:50.342
LATER FOR LYING DOWN,

01:30:50.409 --> 01:30:52.377
WAITING TO GET SHOT
LIKE DOGS.

01:30:52.445 --> 01:30:54.879
NONVIOLENCE DIED IN MEMPHIS
WITH DR. KING.

01:30:54.947 --> 01:30:56.425
WE MUST RETALIATE.
WE GOT THE FUCKING GUNS.

01:30:56.449 --> 01:30:58.083
IT'S TIME
TO USE THEM.

01:30:58.150 --> 01:31:01.419
HOLD ON,
MOTHERFUCKER!

01:31:02.888 --> 01:31:05.323
BROTHER, I HEAR YOU,
BUT I DISAGREE.

01:31:05.391 --> 01:31:07.925
AND WE BOTH KNOW
HUEY DISAGREES.

01:31:07.994 --> 01:31:09.394
YEAH, WE GOT GUNS,

01:31:09.462 --> 01:31:11.829
BUT THE PIG
HAS GOT MORE GUNS.

01:31:11.897 --> 01:31:14.332
THE PIG HAS GOT
THE NATIONAL GUARD.

01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:15.867
I AIN'T AFRAID TO FIGHT,

01:31:15.934 --> 01:31:17.369
BUT WE AIN'T STUPID EITHER.

01:31:17.436 --> 01:31:19.904
THIS HERE IS A TIME
TO BE SMART.

01:31:19.972 --> 01:31:21.906
NO. LATER FOR THAT.

01:31:21.974 --> 01:31:22.907
NO, LATER FOR YOU.

01:31:22.975 --> 01:31:24.609
NOW LISTEN UP, MAN.

01:31:24.676 --> 01:31:28.179
WHAT, WE GOING TO FORGET
ABOUT HUEY AND HIS TRIAL?

01:31:28.247 --> 01:31:30.181
START KILLING PIGS?

01:31:30.249 --> 01:31:32.050
START THE REVOLUTION NOW

01:31:32.118 --> 01:31:34.452
WITH ONE OF OUR
LEADERS IN JAIL? YEAH.

01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:37.889
MAN, IF WE DO THAT,
HUEY'S A DEAD MAN.

01:31:37.956 --> 01:31:40.425
WE'RE ALL DEAD.

01:31:40.493 --> 01:31:42.427
NO, MAN. WE STAY COOL.

01:31:42.495 --> 01:31:44.329
OH, WHAT?

01:31:45.931 --> 01:31:47.798
YOU GIVING ME
ORDERS NOW?

01:31:49.435 --> 01:31:51.869
I'M JUST TELLING YOU
WHAT IT IS.

01:31:51.937 --> 01:31:53.371
LATER FOR THAT.

01:31:53.439 --> 01:31:56.241
IT IS TIME TO INTENSIFY
THE STRUGGLE.

01:31:56.308 --> 01:31:58.709
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

01:32:29.408 --> 01:32:30.508
GOT TO GO.

01:32:30.576 --> 01:32:32.177
BOB...

01:32:32.244 --> 01:32:33.344
DAMN.

01:32:33.412 --> 01:32:34.712
OH, MAN.

01:32:40.919 --> 01:32:42.219
Huey: WE MUST
STAY DISCIPLINED.

01:32:42.287 --> 01:32:44.856
TO ACT WITHOUT A PLAN
IS COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY.

01:32:44.924 --> 01:32:46.357
WE MUST STOP ELDRIDGE.

01:32:46.425 --> 01:32:47.859
EL RAGE IS EL RAGE.

01:32:47.927 --> 01:32:49.360
YOU KNOW HIM.

01:32:49.428 --> 01:32:53.364
HE GOT TO RECOGNIZE
YOU'RE PARTY LEADER.

01:32:53.432 --> 01:32:55.867
IT AIN'T EASY
RUNNING AROUND LECTURING

01:32:55.935 --> 01:32:58.369
TRYING TO RAISE BREAD
TO DEFEND YOUR ASS.

01:32:58.437 --> 01:33:01.238
YOU ALWAYS COULD
TALK YOUR BUTT OFF.

01:33:01.306 --> 01:33:04.726
HEY. DON'T WORRY
ABOUT ME.

01:33:04.793 --> 01:33:06.794
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT YOU?

01:33:06.863 --> 01:33:09.697
IT AIN'T THE SAME
WITHOUT YOU, HUEY.

01:33:13.870 --> 01:33:16.238
ALL POWER TO THE PEOPLE.

01:33:16.305 --> 01:33:18.240
ALL POWER
TO THE PEOPLE.

01:33:18.307 --> 01:33:19.908
YOU GOT TO SIT
ON ELDRIDGE.

01:33:25.047 --> 01:33:26.481
HERE YOU GO.

01:33:26.548 --> 01:33:28.716
KEEP PASSING
IT DOWN.

01:33:28.784 --> 01:33:30.151
HERE YOU GO.

01:33:32.621 --> 01:33:34.055
ALL RIGHT.
SHELLS.

01:33:34.123 --> 01:33:35.556
GIVE ME
MORE SHELLS.

01:33:35.624 --> 01:33:37.525
PIGS BE HERE
ANY MINUTE.

01:33:37.593 --> 01:33:39.327
WE READY
FOR THEM.

01:33:45.134 --> 01:33:47.335
THIS IS
FOR BROTHER MALCOLM...

01:33:47.403 --> 01:33:49.837
BROTHER MARTIN...

01:33:49.906 --> 01:33:52.840
AND BEING
A MOTHERFUCKING PIG.

01:33:59.748 --> 01:34:00.748

01:34:14.513 --> 01:34:16.314
GO! GO! GO!

01:34:26.108 --> 01:34:27.475
THERE THEY ARE!

01:34:34.550 --> 01:34:35.983
COME ON,
GET UP!

01:34:36.051 --> 01:34:37.485
GET UP.
COME ON!

01:34:37.553 --> 01:34:38.986
COME ON.
LET'S GO!

01:34:39.054 --> 01:34:41.656
COME ON, MAN.
LET'S GO!

01:34:42.792 --> 01:34:44.058
COME ON, MAN.

01:34:49.131 --> 01:34:50.231
GET INSIDE.

01:34:50.299 --> 01:34:51.299
GET INSIDE.

01:34:55.904 --> 01:34:56.838
STAY DOWN!

01:34:56.905 --> 01:34:57.905
STAY DOWN!

01:35:02.878 --> 01:35:04.379
AAH!

01:35:04.447 --> 01:35:05.880
STAY DOWN!
STAY DOWN!

01:35:05.948 --> 01:35:08.199
OH, NO!
STOP THEM!

01:35:11.737 --> 01:35:13.170
HELP! HELP! HELP!

01:35:20.779 --> 01:35:21.980
AH!

01:35:22.047 --> 01:35:24.181
AAH!

01:35:27.285 --> 01:35:29.520
HOLD YOUR FIRE!

01:35:29.588 --> 01:35:31.022
STAY DOWN,
LITTLE BOBBY.

01:35:32.091 --> 01:35:34.458
GET US OUT.

01:35:34.627 --> 01:35:35.643
GO!

01:35:35.711 --> 01:35:36.711
GO!

01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:40.448
COME OUT
WITH YOUR HANDS UP!

01:35:40.516 --> 01:35:41.682
UHH!

01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:43.784
LOOK OUT!
LOOK OUT!

01:35:43.852 --> 01:35:44.952
YOU HURT?

01:35:45.021 --> 01:35:47.489
THROW DOWN YOUR WEAPONS

01:35:47.556 --> 01:35:50.325
AND COME OUT
WITH YOUR HANDS UP!

01:35:50.393 --> 01:35:51.493
I'M OK.

01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:52.994
YOU HAVE 5 SECONDS.

01:35:53.062 --> 01:35:54.496
TAKE YOUR CLOTHES OFF.

01:35:54.563 --> 01:35:55.663
WHAT?

01:35:55.731 --> 01:35:58.166
THE PIGS AIN'T GOING
TO SHOOT YOU

01:35:58.234 --> 01:36:00.101
IF YOU'RE NAKED
AND UNARMED.

01:36:00.169 --> 01:36:01.269
3...

01:36:01.337 --> 01:36:02.770
JUST DO IT!

01:36:02.838 --> 01:36:04.672
KEEP YOUR HANDS UP.

01:36:04.740 --> 01:36:06.541
KEEP YOUR HANDS UP,
BOBBY.

01:36:06.608 --> 01:36:08.510
DON'T TRY ANYTHING!

01:36:08.577 --> 01:36:10.011
I'M NOT
RESISTING ARREST!

01:36:10.079 --> 01:36:12.380
I'M NOT
RESISTING ARREST!

01:36:12.448 --> 01:36:14.815
PUT YOUR HANDS
ON THE CAR!

01:36:15.984 --> 01:36:17.652
AAH!

01:36:17.719 --> 01:36:19.120
NO! NO!

01:36:19.188 --> 01:36:20.821
MOTHERFUCKERS!

01:36:22.591 --> 01:36:24.859
HE WAS GOING FOR THIS.

01:36:33.702 --> 01:36:37.138
AND I SAY
TO THE FAMILY AND FRIENDS

01:36:37.206 --> 01:36:38.639
THAT I STAND HERE

01:36:38.707 --> 01:36:41.309
WITH THIS STRANGE
FEELING OF JOY

01:36:41.377 --> 01:36:42.977
AND THANKSGIVING,

01:36:43.045 --> 01:36:44.979
KNOWING
THAT OUR YOUNG BROTHER

01:36:45.047 --> 01:36:46.981
DID NOT DIE IN VAIN.

01:36:47.049 --> 01:36:48.983
HE DIED FOR THE PEOPLE.

01:36:49.051 --> 01:36:50.985
AND, OUT OF HIS DEATH,

01:36:51.053 --> 01:36:53.488
WE MUST GO BACK
TO OUR COMMUNITY

01:36:53.556 --> 01:36:56.324
WITH THIS NEW SENSE
OF LIFE FORCE

01:36:56.392 --> 01:36:58.159
FOR LIBERATION.

01:36:58.227 --> 01:37:00.395
HE SAID IT WELL,

01:37:00.596 --> 01:37:02.363
"POWER TO THE PEOPLE."

01:37:02.431 --> 01:37:04.365
HE WAS JUST A KID.

01:37:04.433 --> 01:37:05.544
BROWN POWER
FOR BROWN PEOPLE,

01:37:05.568 --> 01:37:07.335
RED POWER
FOR RED PEOPLE...

01:37:07.402 --> 01:37:08.736
THEY HURTING US,
BABY.

01:37:08.804 --> 01:37:10.237
HUEY'S
LOCKED UP.

01:37:10.305 --> 01:37:12.239
WHITE POWER
FOR WHITE PEOPLE...

01:37:12.307 --> 01:37:14.742
BOBBY RUNNING ALL
OVER THE COUNTRY

01:37:14.810 --> 01:37:16.911
AND TRYING TO HOLD
THINGS TOGETHER.

01:37:16.979 --> 01:37:20.281
CY'S DEAD,

01:37:20.349 --> 01:37:23.351
AND LITTLE BOBBY.

01:37:23.418 --> 01:37:24.853
I DON'T EVEN
RECOGNIZE

01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:28.122
HALF THE FACES
AT THE MEETINGS...

01:37:28.190 --> 01:37:29.791
EXCEPT HIS.

01:37:33.696 --> 01:37:36.698
NOW, LOOK, I GOT
TO GO GET ON A PLANE,

01:37:36.765 --> 01:37:39.200
GO RAISE MONEY
FOR HUEY'S TRIAL.

01:37:39.267 --> 01:37:41.536
I WANT YOU ALL
TO MAKE SURE

01:37:41.604 --> 01:37:44.038
THERE'S A STRONG
PANTHER PRESENCE THERE.

01:37:44.106 --> 01:37:45.306
HEAR ME?

01:37:45.374 --> 01:37:46.474
YES, SIR.

01:37:46.542 --> 01:37:47.642
ALL RIGHT.

01:37:47.710 --> 01:37:49.143
WHAT ABOUT
ELDRIDGE?

01:37:49.211 --> 01:37:51.646
YOU DID GET HIM
OUT ON BAIL?

01:37:51.714 --> 01:37:53.381
YEAH,

01:37:53.448 --> 01:37:56.818
BUT THINGS
GETTING TOO HOT.

01:37:56.886 --> 01:37:58.386
ELDRIDGE IS...

01:37:58.453 --> 01:38:00.121
IS GOING TO DISAPPEAR.

01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:12.834
THE FREE HUEY THING'S
BECOME

01:38:12.902 --> 01:38:16.004
A BIT OF A RALLYING CRY
FOR THE LEFT,

01:38:16.071 --> 01:38:18.339
ESPECIALLY WITH
BOBBY SEALE RUNNING AROUND

01:38:18.407 --> 01:38:19.707
FANNING THE FLAMES.

01:38:19.775 --> 01:38:20.875
RALLYING CRY!

01:38:20.943 --> 01:38:22.810
THAT'S INSURRECTION!

01:38:22.878 --> 01:38:25.713
SIR, THE PANTHERS HAVE
BECOME VERY RESOURCEFUL.

01:38:25.781 --> 01:38:27.214
I'M AFRAID
WE'VE UNDERESTIMATED

01:38:27.282 --> 01:38:29.316
THEIR SUPPORT
IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY.

01:38:29.384 --> 01:38:30.985
THAT'S THEIR POWER BASE.

01:38:31.053 --> 01:38:33.988
THEY SAY A BLACK PANTHER
IS BORN EVERY MINUTE

01:38:34.056 --> 01:38:35.623
IN THE GHETTO.

01:38:35.691 --> 01:38:38.826
TELL HIM I WANT THAT
POWER BASE NEUTRALIZED!

01:38:38.894 --> 01:38:41.529
MR. HOOVER WISHES THE ULTIMATE
CONTINGENCY IMPLEMENTED.

01:38:41.597 --> 01:38:43.230
YOU MEAN...

01:38:43.298 --> 01:38:45.166
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I MEAN!

01:38:46.569 --> 01:38:49.737
AND AGENT RODGERS, THIS
CONVERSATION NEVER OCCURRED.

01:38:58.948 --> 01:39:00.815
Dorsett: RODGERS,
THIS IS NO GOOD.

01:39:00.883 --> 01:39:02.360
Rodgers: CUT THE COMEDY.
YOU'VE BEEN TAKING

01:39:02.384 --> 01:39:05.336
MONEY FROM THE MOB
FOR YEARS.

01:39:05.403 --> 01:39:08.523
GENTLEMEN, FORGIVE ME
FOR KEEPING YOU.

01:39:10.392 --> 01:39:13.328
AHH, DORSETT, NO MATTER
HOW WE DENY IT,

01:39:13.395 --> 01:39:17.031
WE ALWAYS END UP ON
THE SAME SIDE OF THE COIN.

01:39:17.233 --> 01:39:19.100
IT'S ALMOST FUNNY.

01:39:19.167 --> 01:39:20.902
HONESTLY,
IT TURNS MY STOMACH.

01:39:20.970 --> 01:39:22.971
NEITHER YOUR STOMACH
NOR YOUR OPINION

01:39:23.038 --> 01:39:25.006
MATTERS HERE, DORSETT.

01:39:25.074 --> 01:39:28.042
WHAT MATTERS IS THAT
MR. TYNAN'S CLIENTS

01:39:28.110 --> 01:39:31.045
AND THE BUREAU HAVE
COME UP WITH A SOLUTION

01:39:31.113 --> 01:39:32.546
TO OUR PANTHER PROBLEM.

01:39:32.615 --> 01:39:34.548
THE FINAL SOLUTION,
YOU MIGHT SAY.

01:39:34.617 --> 01:39:37.602
OUR CLIENTS, OF COURSE,
ARE VERY PLEASED

01:39:38.036 --> 01:39:40.287
MR. HOOVER DECIDED TO TAKE
OUR SUGGESTION TO HEART.

01:39:40.355 --> 01:39:43.357
BY THE WAY, WHY DID
HE CHANGE HIS MIND?

01:39:43.425 --> 01:39:44.626
WOMAN'S INTUITION.

01:39:44.693 --> 01:39:48.129
ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN
CONTROL THE PRODUCT?

01:39:48.196 --> 01:39:50.031
CAN YOU ASSURE US

01:39:50.099 --> 01:39:52.366
THAT THIS WILL NOT
GET OUT OF HAND?

01:39:52.434 --> 01:39:53.668
OF COURSE.

01:39:53.736 --> 01:39:55.637
OUR CLIENTS HAVE
VAST EXPERIENCE

01:39:55.704 --> 01:39:57.138
IN THESE COMMUNITIES.

01:39:57.205 --> 01:39:58.640
IT'S JUST A MATTER
OF DEGREES.

01:39:58.707 --> 01:40:01.643
YOU GIVE US FREE REIGN
IN THE GHETTO,

01:40:01.710 --> 01:40:02.810
WE SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS.

01:40:02.878 --> 01:40:04.044
I'LL ASSURE YOU
OF ONE THING.

01:40:04.112 --> 01:40:07.047
THE PACIFYING QUALITIES
OF HEROIN ARE FORMIDABLE.

01:40:07.115 --> 01:40:10.551
A JUNKIE'S POLITICS
ARE NOT LIKE YOURS AND MINE.

01:40:10.619 --> 01:40:13.053
I'LL EVEN READ
THE FUTURE FOR YOU...

01:40:13.121 --> 01:40:14.822
VERY SOON,
THE JIGABOOS...

01:40:14.890 --> 01:40:16.324
NO OFFENSE...

01:40:16.392 --> 01:40:19.260
THE JIGABOOS WILL BE
WANTING THE STUFF SO BAD...

01:40:19.328 --> 01:40:21.162
TRYING TO GET,
TO SELL...

01:40:21.229 --> 01:40:22.874
THEY'LL BE BLOWING
EACH OTHER'S BRAINS OUT.

01:40:22.898 --> 01:40:24.332
IT'S NOT A RACIAL ISSUE.

01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:26.768
IT'S A MATTER
OF LAW AND ORDER.

01:40:26.835 --> 01:40:28.269
OF COURSE.
AT ANY RATE,

01:40:28.337 --> 01:40:30.571
WE JUST SET THEM UP
AND STEP BACK.

01:40:30.639 --> 01:40:33.591
WHEN CAN YOU GET IT
OUT IN THE STREETS?

01:40:33.659 --> 01:40:35.092
AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE.

01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:37.962
WE'LL MANUFACTURE AND
DISTRIBUTE FROM A WAREHOUSE.

01:40:38.030 --> 01:40:39.463
DORSETT KNOWS THE LOCALE.

01:40:39.531 --> 01:40:40.598
I REITERATE.

01:40:40.666 --> 01:40:42.600
WE NEED ASSURANCES
ON CONTAINMENT...

01:40:42.668 --> 01:40:45.603
THAT IT STAYS STRICTLY
WITHIN THE PROBLEM AREA.

01:40:45.671 --> 01:40:48.940
I WANT YOU TO PUT
SOMEBODY ON THIS.

01:40:49.007 --> 01:40:52.142
KEEP TABS
ON THE NEW OPERATION.

01:40:52.210 --> 01:40:53.778
NO OFFENSE.

01:40:55.380 --> 01:40:58.816
YOU TALK AS IF
THIS THING'S BEEN DECIDED.

01:40:58.884 --> 01:40:59.884
IT HAS BEEN.

01:41:01.787 --> 01:41:03.487
PIGS FIND HIM YET?

01:41:03.555 --> 01:41:05.890
NO, THEY HAVEN'T.

01:41:05.958 --> 01:41:07.357
THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW

01:41:07.425 --> 01:41:09.660
WHO WAS IN THE CAR
WITH YOU.

01:41:09.728 --> 01:41:11.328
GOOD LUCK, HUEY.

01:41:13.599 --> 01:41:14.782
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

01:41:14.850 --> 01:41:16.351
FREE HUEY!
FREE HUEY!

01:41:16.418 --> 01:41:17.468
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

01:41:17.535 --> 01:41:18.970
FREE HUEY!
FREE HUEY!

01:41:19.037 --> 01:41:20.471
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

01:41:20.538 --> 01:41:21.973
FREE HUEY!
FREE HUEY!

01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:23.474
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

01:41:23.541 --> 01:41:24.976
FREE HUEY!
FREE HUEY!

01:41:25.043 --> 01:41:27.044
ALL POWER TO THE PEOPLE!

01:41:27.479 --> 01:41:28.512
POWER TO THE PEOPLE!

01:41:28.580 --> 01:41:31.015
BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
STOKELY CARMICHAEL!

01:41:33.301 --> 01:41:37.638
YOU SAY THAT HUEY P. NEWTON
IS A PRISONER OF WAR.

01:41:37.706 --> 01:41:40.641
NOW, MANY PEOPLE SAY
THAT THAT'S NOT TRUE

01:41:40.709 --> 01:41:43.143
OR THAT THE PARTY
IS EXAGGERATING.

01:41:43.211 --> 01:41:44.245
NO!

01:41:44.312 --> 01:41:45.747
BUT I THINK IT'S CLEAR...

01:41:45.814 --> 01:41:47.248
IT'S CRYSTAL CLEAR

01:41:47.315 --> 01:41:51.185
THE UNITED STATES HAS
DECLARED WAR ON BLACK PEOPLE.

01:41:54.172 --> 01:41:55.606
NOW, SHE DID THAT

01:41:55.674 --> 01:41:59.110
WHEN SHE TOOK THE FIRST
BLACK MAN FROM AFRICA.

01:41:59.177 --> 01:42:02.179
AH, SHE NEVER CAME OUT
AND SAID THE WORDS...

01:42:02.247 --> 01:42:04.098
"I DECLARE WAR
ON BLACK PEOPLE."

01:42:04.166 --> 01:42:05.832
NO, SHE DIDN'T DO THAT.

01:42:05.900 --> 01:42:08.402
BUT LET US STUDY
OUR HISTORY.

01:42:08.470 --> 01:42:10.404
TO THIS DAY,
THE UNITED STATES

01:42:10.472 --> 01:42:12.106
HAS NOT DECLARED WAR
ON VIETNAM,

01:42:12.174 --> 01:42:13.607
BUT THERE IS VIETNAM.

01:42:13.675 --> 01:42:19.012
AND THEY DID NOT
DECLARE WAR IN NORTH KOREA,

01:42:19.081 --> 01:42:22.015
BUT THEY SURE FOUGHT
IN NORTH KOREA.

01:42:22.084 --> 01:42:26.019
AND THEY DID NOT DECLARE WAR
ON THE INDIANS.

01:42:26.088 --> 01:42:28.021
THEY JUST WIPED THEM OUT.

01:42:28.090 --> 01:42:30.224
RIGHT ON!
RIGHT ON!

01:42:30.292 --> 01:42:31.425
THEY WIPED THEM OUT!

01:42:31.493 --> 01:42:32.593
THAT'S RIGHT!

01:42:32.660 --> 01:42:33.660
SO...

01:42:33.695 --> 01:42:35.629
WE MUST DEFINE
OUR POSITION.

01:42:35.697 --> 01:42:37.731
WE ARE AT WAR.

01:42:37.799 --> 01:42:40.033
HUEY P. NEWTON,
MINISTER OF DEFENSE,

01:42:40.102 --> 01:42:42.403
IS A PRISONER OF WAR.

01:42:42.471 --> 01:42:44.105
THAT'S RIGHT!

01:42:44.172 --> 01:42:47.508
WE MUST GET HIM OUT

01:42:47.576 --> 01:42:49.110
BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY!

01:42:49.177 --> 01:42:52.563
BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY!

01:42:53.699 --> 01:42:55.132
FREE HUEY!
FREE HUEY!

01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:56.834
FREE HUEY!
FREE HUEY!

01:42:56.901 --> 01:42:59.237
FREE HUEY!
FREE HUEY!

01:42:59.304 --> 01:43:00.804
FREE HUEY!
FREE HUEY!

01:43:00.872 --> 01:43:01.972
SO?

01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:04.975
WE KNOW FOR SURE
THERE WAS A PASSENGER.

01:43:05.043 --> 01:43:06.977
WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHO.

01:43:07.045 --> 01:43:09.980
YOU CAN'T HELP BUT ADMIRE
THOSE YOUNG BROTHERS.

01:43:10.048 --> 01:43:12.983
THEY DO A LOT OF GOOD
IN THEIR COMMUNITIES.

01:43:13.051 --> 01:43:15.286
YOU EVER HEARD
ABOUT THE COMMON GOOD?

01:43:15.354 --> 01:43:17.788
THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA IS MORE

01:43:17.856 --> 01:43:19.490
THAN A SIMPLE COLLECTION
OF GHETTOS.

01:43:19.557 --> 01:43:20.992
THIS COUNTRY WAS BUILT

01:43:21.059 --> 01:43:22.493
ON CAPITALISM
AND DEMOCRACY.

01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:24.495
IN A DEMOCRACY,
THE MAJORITY RULES.

01:43:24.562 --> 01:43:27.831
WE ARE A MINORITY UNLESS
WE INTEGRATE FULLY.

01:43:27.900 --> 01:43:30.334
WHOSE SIDE
ARE YOU ON, BROTHER?

01:43:30.402 --> 01:43:34.021
NO. WHOSE SIDE
ARE YOU ON, OFFICER?

01:43:34.088 --> 01:43:34.938
NOW, YOU SAY

01:43:35.006 --> 01:43:37.275
THAT HUEY NEWTON
OPENED FIRE THAT NIGHT

01:43:37.342 --> 01:43:38.776
WITHOUT ANY PROVOCATION.

01:43:38.843 --> 01:43:40.778
WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE?

01:43:40.845 --> 01:43:42.780
IT WAS A DARK NIGHT.

01:43:42.847 --> 01:43:44.782
THERE WAS
LOTS OF CONFUSION.

01:43:44.849 --> 01:43:46.284
WELL, SIR,
I WAS THERE.

01:43:47.719 --> 01:43:49.153
THAT'S RIGHT, YOU WERE.

01:43:49.220 --> 01:43:51.121
HE WAS THERE.

01:43:51.189 --> 01:43:52.623
HE SAW EVERYTHING.

01:43:52.691 --> 01:43:55.125
AND HE IS NOT ON TRIAL.

01:43:55.193 --> 01:44:00.498
HE DOES NOT NEED TO LIE
TO SAVE HIS OWN LIFE.

01:44:03.034 --> 01:44:04.134
YOUR WITNESS.

01:44:04.202 --> 01:44:05.303
THANK YOU.

01:44:05.370 --> 01:44:07.371
NO QUESTIONS,
YOUR HONOR.

01:44:07.439 --> 01:44:09.039
WELL, YOU MAY STEP DOWN.

01:44:09.107 --> 01:44:11.742
BUT IF IT PLEASE
THE COURT,

01:44:11.810 --> 01:44:15.245
I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE
TESTIMONY AT THIS TIME

01:44:15.314 --> 01:44:17.014
FROM A NEW WITNESS,

01:44:17.081 --> 01:44:20.984
ONE WHO, UH, IS NOT
ON TRIAL FOR HIS LIFE,

01:44:21.052 --> 01:44:24.555
BUT ONE WHO WAS
ALSO THERE.

01:44:24.623 --> 01:44:26.324
I CALL...

01:44:26.391 --> 01:44:29.493
GENE McKINNEY TO THE STAND.

01:44:29.561 --> 01:44:30.928
I OBJECT,
YOUR HONOR!

01:44:30.995 --> 01:44:31.995
WHO IS THIS MAN?

01:44:32.063 --> 01:44:35.333
THIS IS AN EYEWITNESS,
YOUR HONOR...

01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:39.570
THE PASSENGER
IN HUEY NEWTON'S CAR.

01:44:39.638 --> 01:44:41.171
Judge: OVERRULED.

01:44:41.239 --> 01:44:43.774
MR. GARRY, YOU MAY
EXAMINE YOUR WITNESS.

01:44:43.842 --> 01:44:45.976
Bailiff: DO YOU SWEAR
TO TELL THE WHOLE TRUTH,

01:44:46.044 --> 01:44:47.322
NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH
SO HELP YOU GOD?

01:44:47.346 --> 01:44:48.379
I DO.

01:44:49.914 --> 01:44:51.449
MR. McKINNEY,

01:44:51.516 --> 01:44:54.952
WERE YOU A PASSENGER
IN THE CAR THAT NIGHT,

01:44:55.019 --> 01:44:57.087
OCTOBER 28, 1967?

01:44:57.155 --> 01:45:00.358
I KEEP SAYING 5,
LIKE THE FIFTH AMENDMENT.

01:45:00.425 --> 01:45:01.625
YES. YES, SIR, I WAS.

01:45:03.862 --> 01:45:08.199
AND DID YOU WITNESS
THE SHOOTOUT?

01:45:13.605 --> 01:45:15.139
YES, SIR, I DID.

01:45:17.409 --> 01:45:18.742
ORDER. ORDER.

01:45:18.810 --> 01:45:22.579
FROM WHAT YOU SAW...

01:45:24.383 --> 01:45:27.118
DID HUEY NEWTON
START THE SHOOTING?

01:45:28.286 --> 01:45:30.254
LOOK, AM I
UNDER ARREST?

01:45:30.322 --> 01:45:31.922

01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:52.908
TODAY IS A NEW DAY.

01:55:56.513 --> 01:55:57.513
OHH.

01:56:05.689 --> 01:56:06.789
JUDGE, HELP.

01:56:06.856 --> 01:56:09.425
HE'S GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT.

01:56:09.493 --> 01:56:12.928
WE GOT TO GET HIM UP
AND OUT OF HERE.

01:56:12.996 --> 01:56:14.163
COME ON.

01:56:16.933 --> 01:56:20.869
WE GOT TO GET YOU
OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW.

01:56:20.937 --> 01:56:22.371
I AIN'T GOING
TO MAKE IT.

01:56:22.439 --> 01:56:24.373
YES, YOU ARE.
I GOT YOU.

01:56:24.441 --> 01:56:27.076
I'LL DISTRACT THE PIGS.

01:56:27.144 --> 01:56:29.645
GIVE ME THE LIGHTER.

01:56:44.361 --> 01:56:46.429

01:57:20.330 --> 01:57:22.765
Cop: COME ON!

01:57:22.832 --> 01:57:25.201
Loudspeaker:
THIS IS THE POLICE!

01:57:25.269 --> 01:57:27.036
YOU HAVE 5 SECONDS
TO COME OUT

01:57:27.103 --> 01:57:28.971
WITH YOUR HANDS UP.

01:57:29.039 --> 01:57:32.141
I REPEAT. YOU ARE ORDERED
TO COME OUT

01:57:32.209 --> 01:57:33.643
WITH YOUR HANDS UP!

01:57:33.710 --> 01:57:35.645

01:57:35.712 --> 01:57:37.846

01:57:46.657 --> 01:57:47.690
ONE!

01:58:24.661 --> 01:58:27.096
Judge: WELL, WE FINALLY
GOT THAT STOPLIGHT.

01:58:27.163 --> 01:58:29.098
THEY PUMPED IN THE DOPE

01:58:29.165 --> 01:58:31.100
TO NEUTRALIZE
THE BLACK COMMUNITY

01:58:31.167 --> 01:58:33.235
AND DESTROY
THE PANTHER POWER BASE,

01:58:33.303 --> 01:58:36.238
BUT DRUGS OVERFLOWED
THE BORDERS OF THE GHETTO

01:58:36.306 --> 01:58:38.474
AND ENDED UP ON ALL
AMERICA'S DOORSTEP.

01:58:38.541 --> 01:58:39.958
LOOK AT THAT!

01:58:40.026 --> 01:58:43.262
DESPITE ONGOING PERSECUTION
BY THE AUTHORITIES,

01:58:43.330 --> 01:58:46.265
THE PANTHERS CONTINUED TO
PROVIDE BREAKFAST PROGRAMS,

01:58:46.333 --> 01:58:47.866
SICKLE CELL ANEMIA TESTING,

01:58:47.934 --> 01:58:49.868
EVEN SCHOOLS
FOR THE COMMUNITY.

01:58:49.936 --> 01:58:51.837
BEFORE THEY WERE
EVENTUALLY CRUSHED,

01:58:51.904 --> 01:58:53.339
THE PANTHERS HAD CHAPTERS

01:58:53.406 --> 01:58:56.342
IN ALMOST EVERY STATE
OF THE UNION

01:58:56.409 --> 01:58:57.843
AND SEVERAL
FOREIGN COUNTRIES.

01:58:57.910 --> 01:59:00.846
IT CAME OUT LATER
THAT HOOVER AND THE FBI

01:59:00.913 --> 01:59:03.782
USED ILLEGAL TACTICS
TO DESTROY THE PANTHERS.

01:59:03.850 --> 01:59:06.785
SEVERAL PANTHERS ARE STILL
BEING HELD IN PRISON

01:59:06.853 --> 01:59:09.388
ON TRUMPED-UP CHARGES.

01:59:09.456 --> 01:59:15.261
