Heave!

03:03.764 --> 03:06.433
- Heave!
- One, two.

03:42.177 --> 03:43.637
Look over there!

04:08.954 --> 04:10.330
Can't find anyone!

04:22.467 --> 04:23.802
Take the pony!

04:27.597 --> 04:28.765
Eggs?

04:34.187 --> 04:35.230
Come on!

04:44.448 --> 04:45.615
There are women here.

04:58.378 --> 04:59.629
Let's go.

05:01.965 --> 05:03.175
Stay here.

06:04.403 --> 06:05.862
Shh.

06:09.074 --> 06:11.701
<i>My mother told me</i>

06:11.785 --> 06:13.453
<i>Someday I would buy</i>

06:14.538 --> 06:17.124
<i>Galley with good oars</i>

06:17.207 --> 06:19.292
<i>Sail to distant shores</i>

06:20.001 --> 06:22.003
<i>Stand up high in the prow</i>

06:22.462 --> 06:24.589
<i>Noble barque I steer</i>

06:25.215 --> 06:27.592
<i>Steady course for the haven</i>

06:27.884 --> 06:32.222
<i>Hew many foe-men,
hew many foe-men</i>

06:32.931 --> 06:35.434
<i>My mother told me</i>

06:35.517 --> 06:37.519
<i>Someday I would buy</i>

06:38.103 --> 06:40.188
<i>Galley with good oars</i>

06:40.689 --> 06:42.649
<i>Sail to distant shores</i>

06:43.275 --> 06:45.402
<i>Stand up high in the prow</i>

06:45.777 --> 06:47.821
<i>Noble barque I steer</i>

06:48.447 --> 06:50.907
<i>Steady course for the haven</i>

06:50.991 --> 06:55.495
<i>Hew many foe-men,
hew many foe-men</i>

07:06.298 --> 07:07.591
Holy Man!

07:09.509 --> 07:12.137
I have nothing!
Please help me!

07:12.554 --> 07:13.555
Anything!

07:14.055 --> 07:15.307
Anything, please.

07:15.390 --> 07:16.683
Please, anything.

07:16.766 --> 07:17.893
Oh, please!

07:17.976 --> 07:19.019
Good boy.

07:19.811 --> 07:21.480
Come, come!
Thank you, no.

07:21.563 --> 07:22.731
Alfred!

07:23.482 --> 07:24.733
English?

07:24.816 --> 07:26.651
Come over here, English!

07:27.152 --> 07:28.904
I'm a good girl.
Clean.

07:28.987 --> 07:31.239
Alfred! No!

07:31.323 --> 07:33.825
Please,
look! Look!
No!

07:34.326 --> 07:35.327
Alfred!
Stay with me!

07:35.410 --> 07:37.579
The finger bone
of St. Augustine.

07:37.662 --> 07:38.914
Believe me.
Yes.

07:38.997 --> 07:40.373
- Please.
- Please.

07:40.457 --> 07:41.708
And please,
look, sir, sir...

07:41.791 --> 07:42.751
No, no!
Go away!

07:42.834 --> 07:44.419
A splinter from
the true cross.

07:44.503 --> 07:45.587
You buy! It change
your life. And cheap!

07:45.712 --> 07:46.838
Alfred!

07:49.966 --> 07:51.176
Welcome.

07:51.259 --> 07:54.804
God bless you all
for undertaking the
arduous journey here

07:54.888 --> 07:56.598
to meet with His Holiness.

07:59.434 --> 08:02.646
Holy Father,
let me present to you

08:02.729 --> 08:05.690
Prince Alfred and
Prince Aethelwulf
of Wessex,

08:06.191 --> 08:08.693
and our old friend,
Father Prudentius.

08:16.201 --> 08:19.204
Let me speak
first to both of you.

08:22.874 --> 08:24.209
Holy Father.

08:27.587 --> 08:28.755
Holy Father.

08:30.757 --> 08:33.385
Like a good shepherd
caring for his sheep,

08:33.760 --> 08:36.263
we care very much for
our flock in England.

08:37.054 --> 08:40.725
Like us, you are assailed
by pagan armies

08:41.017 --> 08:43.436
who love only
destruction and death.

08:44.688 --> 08:47.065
If Christian people do not
quickly do penance

08:47.148 --> 08:50.068
for their various
vices and crimes,

08:50.568 --> 08:55.323
then a great and crushing
disaster will swiftly
come upon you.

08:55.907 --> 08:58.118
I fear that is true,
your Holiness.

08:58.910 --> 09:02.038
We already see what
has happened in England
and now in Frankia.

09:02.289 --> 09:04.958
We hear that
Paris was saved

09:05.041 --> 09:08.920
only by granting
a huge parcel of land
to a pagan called Rollo.

09:09.629 --> 09:12.799
This is surely
an utterly detestable crime.

09:12.882 --> 09:16.011
To give to the people
who brought evil
on Christians

09:16.094 --> 09:17.470
power over Christians,

09:17.554 --> 09:20.473
their land, and the very
churches of Christ.

09:20.557 --> 09:22.892
You speak the truth,
Father Prudentius.

09:22.976 --> 09:25.061
It is utterly detestable

09:25.145 --> 09:27.480
that the persecutors
of the Christian faith

09:27.564 --> 09:29.774
should be set up
as lords over Christians.

09:30.734 --> 09:35.613
And that Christian folk
have to serve men
who worship demons.

09:37.866 --> 09:39.743
But we look
to the future,

09:41.619 --> 09:43.413
to you,
Prince Alfred
of Wessex.

09:45.957 --> 09:47.459
Step forward,
my son.

09:54.257 --> 09:56.801
I have something
amazing to show you.

09:57.302 --> 09:59.387
Here in Rome,
we have many treasures.

09:59.471 --> 10:02.474
And here is almost
the greatest of them.

10:13.193 --> 10:14.486
Do you know what this is?

10:16.613 --> 10:18.907
When our Lord was taken
to the place of crucifixion,

10:19.949 --> 10:22.160
what did the pagans
make him carry?

10:22.243 --> 10:23.745
His own cross.

10:24.079 --> 10:26.039
And what did they
place upon his head?

10:26.164 --> 10:27.499
A crown of thorns.

10:28.917 --> 10:33.338
This is one of the very thorns
that cut our Savior's head.

11:06.496 --> 11:07.789
The farmer was
a generous man.

11:07.872 --> 11:10.291
Yes, with all his
goods and chattels!

11:10.375 --> 11:12.043
We enjoyed their company.

11:15.422 --> 11:16.714
Did you kill them?

11:17.382 --> 11:18.758
Of course
we killed them.

11:20.093 --> 11:22.220
They could have
ridden off and told
the Franks all about us.

11:22.303 --> 11:23.388
You would have
done the same.

11:25.056 --> 11:26.349
I'm not blaming you.

11:50.999 --> 11:52.167
<i>Harbard!</i>

11:59.215 --> 12:00.425
Harbard!

12:38.796 --> 12:40.173
Harbard!

12:52.143 --> 12:55.146
It's Lagertha.
You had better come,
both of you.

13:13.998 --> 13:15.583
I lost my child.

13:22.840 --> 13:26.177
I knew that I could
never have the child,
no matter what I did.

13:26.302 --> 13:29.597
The Seer told me
a long time ago but...

13:34.143 --> 13:36.479
...I was hoping that
I could cheat the fates.

13:41.609 --> 13:42.694
Shh.

13:46.531 --> 13:47.991
It's all right.

14:00.587 --> 14:01.754
Shh.

14:06.968 --> 14:08.344
Go away.

14:08.428 --> 14:09.429
Shh.

14:12.890 --> 14:14.934
Just, just go away!

14:16.352 --> 14:17.562
Leave me alone.

14:54.182 --> 14:55.350
Your Highness.

14:55.933 --> 14:57.810
Your Grace.
Daughter.

14:59.604 --> 15:01.022
How grateful I am that

15:01.105 --> 15:03.566
we can now announce
that you are with child.

15:10.698 --> 15:12.867
The alliance
between our peoples,

15:12.950 --> 15:15.119
born of baptism
and marriage,

15:15.578 --> 15:17.830
is the only way to
safeguard our future.

15:18.790 --> 15:20.041
In the meantime,

15:20.416 --> 15:24.170
what efforts has
Your Grace made

15:24.253 --> 15:28.132
to ensure that the pagans
have quit our realm?

15:29.592 --> 15:32.720
I have sent boats
down river to ascertain
the truth of it.

15:32.970 --> 15:36.224
It may well be that
my brother will choose
to sack and plunder Rouen,

15:36.307 --> 15:38.309
rather than return
to his people
empty-handed.

15:39.394 --> 15:41.396
But I have already sent word
to the lords of that town

15:41.479 --> 15:44.148
to prepare their defenses
against such an attack.

15:44.816 --> 15:48.403
Above all men,
I know how much
I owe both to God,

15:48.903 --> 15:52.198
and to those closest to me,
for our delivery from evil.

15:53.825 --> 15:56.869
Now, I would also
like to express the same

15:57.370 --> 15:58.746
to Sire Roland.

16:00.164 --> 16:01.457
Though an underling,

16:01.666 --> 16:04.085
I believe you did
far more than
Count Odo to preserve

16:04.919 --> 16:06.671
and defend our city.

16:07.004 --> 16:10.800
Therefore, I proclaim you
in turn, Count Roland,

16:11.175 --> 16:12.677
Defender of Paris.

16:23.688 --> 16:27.525
And may you continue
to serve us faithfully
as before.

16:28.192 --> 16:29.944
I am honored
and humbled.

16:30.528 --> 16:31.904
And ready
to sacrifice myself

16:31.988 --> 16:34.615
at any moment for
Your Highness's
greater glory.

16:42.498 --> 16:43.499
You may all leave,

16:44.375 --> 16:46.377
content in my good graces.

16:54.802 --> 16:56.262
Except for you,
Count Roland.

16:57.555 --> 16:58.806
Stay a moment.

17:05.396 --> 17:08.232
I want to ask your
permission, Count Roland.

17:08.608 --> 17:09.692
My permission?

17:09.776 --> 17:10.943
But for what?

17:11.486 --> 17:13.820
Why should the Emperor
ever have to ask permission?

17:16.449 --> 17:18.201
I want to sleep
with your sister.

17:20.328 --> 17:22.288
I desire her
to be my mistress.

17:24.582 --> 17:25.791
Have you asked her?

17:28.628 --> 17:31.798
I would like
your permission...

17:32.882 --> 17:34.050
First.

17:36.219 --> 17:37.428
You have it.

17:37.887 --> 17:39.263
Of course, Your Highness.

17:40.264 --> 17:43.518
I am sure she will think
of herself as the most
fortunate woman in Paris.

17:47.814 --> 17:48.940
Wait.

17:53.444 --> 17:56.906
There is something else.

18:02.453 --> 18:05.373
Why is my father
giving preference
to those people?

18:06.457 --> 18:07.625
I don't know.

18:07.917 --> 18:10.545
I don't think you
understand the way
things work here.

18:11.337 --> 18:12.755
You are too simple.

18:13.548 --> 18:14.757
Simple?

18:16.759 --> 18:18.302
What is simple?

18:18.970 --> 18:21.514
The person who is
closest to my father

18:21.597 --> 18:24.225
is the person who has
the most power in Frankia.

18:24.392 --> 18:26.811
And it seems as if
he has suddenly
given power

18:26.894 --> 18:28.145
to a young soldier.

18:28.688 --> 18:29.856
But I am Duke.

18:30.106 --> 18:31.941
I have been
given great lands,

18:32.024 --> 18:35.069
and the responsibility
for the defense of
the entire realm.

18:35.486 --> 18:38.739
Even as you say
those words, they
start to sound hollow.

18:39.365 --> 18:41.826
Entire realm,
great lands.

18:42.577 --> 18:43.911
What does it mean?

18:44.328 --> 18:46.956
Roland has actually been
given command of the city.

18:47.039 --> 18:49.584
He will always be
closest to the Emperor.

18:50.501 --> 18:52.003
Do not underestimate
your father.

18:52.086 --> 18:54.881
Oh, it would be impossible
to underestimate him.

18:55.006 --> 18:57.592
Just as it would
be impossible
to understand him.

18:58.384 --> 19:00.970
It's not right that a man
of such humble origin

19:01.053 --> 19:03.848
should take precedence
over you, or me!

19:04.891 --> 19:07.268
It's unfortunate,
but this Roland
should be removed

19:07.351 --> 19:10.187
before his appetite
for power becomes
too pronounced.

19:10.688 --> 19:11.689
Hmm.

19:15.902 --> 19:17.320
What are you doing?

19:17.737 --> 19:18.738
Hmm?

19:22.158 --> 19:23.743
I'm trying
to have sex.

19:24.493 --> 19:26.078
I am with child.

19:26.787 --> 19:27.830
So?

19:29.123 --> 19:30.791
You are carrying
my child!

19:32.043 --> 19:33.336
This makes me
very happy.

19:33.419 --> 19:35.463
So, it's not possible.

19:35.630 --> 19:37.590
No, it's really quite...

19:37.924 --> 19:39.008
Simple.

19:39.091 --> 19:40.968
It's not going
to happen.

19:42.219 --> 19:45.890
I told you, this is Frankia,
we do things differently here.

19:46.891 --> 19:49.435
You have to respect me
in my sacred condition.

20:02.281 --> 20:04.158
Many things
are better here.

20:06.786 --> 20:08.913
Just a few things
which were better before.

20:11.540 --> 20:13.542
Heave!

20:15.461 --> 20:17.254
- Pull!
- Heave!

20:19.423 --> 20:21.300
- Pull!
- Heave!

20:21.384 --> 20:23.260
- One, two.
- Heave!

20:23.344 --> 20:24.345
- One, two.
- Heave!

20:25.179 --> 20:27.264
- One, two.
- Heave!

20:28.349 --> 20:29.517
Heave!

21:50.181 --> 21:51.432
Ecbert of Wessex,

21:51.891 --> 21:54.769
you come among us
to be crowned King
of Wessex and Mercia,

21:55.770 --> 21:58.063
two proud and
ancient kingdoms

21:58.147 --> 22:02.193
which will now be one
and indissoluble
under your governance

22:02.902 --> 22:05.196
and by God's undoubted will.

22:23.547 --> 22:25.007
Amen.

22:25.090 --> 22:29.094
With this Holy Chrism,
we hereby anoint you.

22:36.101 --> 22:37.228
Amen.

22:37.436 --> 22:38.771
Amen.

22:41.982 --> 22:43.317
Take this sword,

22:44.401 --> 22:47.238
which is bestowed on you
with the blessing of God,

22:47.696 --> 22:49.615
that by the power
of the Holy Spirit

22:49.698 --> 22:53.202
you may resist and
cast out all your enemies

22:53.828 --> 22:57.039
and all the enemies of
the Holy Church of God.

23:15.266 --> 23:18.102
With this most ancient
and venerable crown,

23:18.477 --> 23:20.813
and in the sight
of all here present,

23:20.896 --> 23:22.022
and in the sight of God,

23:22.773 --> 23:28.153
I crown you King of
Wessex and Mercia.

23:34.410 --> 23:37.288
Now you are a consul
of Rome, like Caesar!

23:45.254 --> 23:47.840
There was another
who walked up here
beside you.

23:47.923 --> 23:52.469
I saw him. A young monk
and then I saw him no more.

23:53.220 --> 23:57.266
But it seemed to me
that it was a sign from God

24:41.143 --> 24:43.687
I suppose you should
be congratulated,
King Ecbert.

24:45.189 --> 24:47.566
By a clever ruse
you have become ruler

24:47.650 --> 24:51.070
of one of the biggest,
richest kingdoms
in England.

24:52.446 --> 24:54.031
And all without my help.

24:54.990 --> 24:57.326
Despite the fact that
we are formally allies.

24:57.409 --> 25:00.913
No, fortunately,
there was limited
bloodshed.

25:00.996 --> 25:02.873
Which is always
to be favored.

25:02.956 --> 25:06.210
After all, we need
our armies to fight

25:06.335 --> 25:08.379
not each other,
but the Northmen.

25:09.880 --> 25:11.715
You always have
a clever answer.

25:13.133 --> 25:15.344
The fact is,
you betrayed me!

25:17.346 --> 25:19.223
You told me nothing
of your plans.

25:20.265 --> 25:22.976
We were to divide Mercia
equally between us.

25:23.560 --> 25:25.145
But you have
taken it all.

25:26.480 --> 25:27.981
And now
it occurs to me

25:28.065 --> 25:31.652
your new kingdom
directly abuts mine.

25:34.238 --> 25:35.489
So it does.

25:37.741 --> 25:41.036
But surely
we are still allies?

25:43.580 --> 25:46.083
I feel I ought to
ask you that question.

25:51.422 --> 25:55.300
It may be true that
things have changed.

25:56.844 --> 25:59.763
Life is all about change,
is it not, King Aelle?

25:59.847 --> 26:02.599
If we don't change,
we fall behind.

26:03.100 --> 26:05.227
What was once
true, and real,

26:05.310 --> 26:07.688
is suddenly
no longer true,

26:07.771 --> 26:09.189
no longer real.

26:09.273 --> 26:13.193
And sometimes,
we have to accept that.

26:15.279 --> 26:17.030
You mean our alliance?

26:17.114 --> 26:18.198
Yes.

26:18.866 --> 26:21.368
We had an alliance
as equals.

26:21.452 --> 26:25.914
But, as you can
plainly see, we are
no longer equals.

26:26.665 --> 26:28.333
Everything has changed.

26:28.709 --> 26:29.835
For both of us.

26:33.547 --> 26:35.507
You must get used to it.

26:56.361 --> 26:57.780
Together!

27:01.158 --> 27:02.743
- Forward!
- Heave!

27:04.953 --> 27:06.413
Heave!

27:07.790 --> 27:09.082
Heave!

27:10.626 --> 27:11.627
Heave!

27:12.503 --> 27:13.587
Heave!

27:14.963 --> 27:16.548
- Heave!
- Heave!

27:17.216 --> 27:19.384
- Heave!
- Heave!

27:20.010 --> 27:21.887
- Heave!
- Heave!

27:22.805 --> 27:25.015
- Heave!
- Heave!

27:25.098 --> 27:27.184
- Heave!
- Heave!

27:27.810 --> 27:30.187
- Heave!
- Heave!

27:30.270 --> 27:31.688
- Heave!
- Heave!

27:34.274 --> 27:35.275
- Heave!
- Heave!

27:35.359 --> 27:36.652
Ironside!

27:37.069 --> 27:38.111
Come and see.

27:39.363 --> 27:40.364
See what?

27:40.447 --> 27:41.615
Just come!
It's worth it.

27:41.698 --> 27:44.451
All of you, come!
Follow us.

27:44.535 --> 27:45.911
All of you! Follow us!

27:47.037 --> 27:48.163
Come! Come on!

27:52.209 --> 27:53.210
Follow us.

27:54.044 --> 27:56.964
Ragnar!
Ragnar Lothbrok!
Hail Ragnar!

28:45.846 --> 28:48.765
- Hail Ragnar Lothbrok!
- Hail Ragnar!

29:04.781 --> 29:05.949
I'm not finished yet.

29:06.658 --> 29:08.452
There's one more
thing I have to do.

29:41.485 --> 29:43.153
You are a mystery to me.

29:47.407 --> 29:51.119
When I asked you
to come with me, you did.

29:53.538 --> 29:55.540
You didn't ask for
anything in return.

29:59.044 --> 30:00.337
What do you want?

30:01.213 --> 30:02.506
What can I give you?

30:04.049 --> 30:07.135
Perhaps you could have
asked me that question
a long time ago.

30:11.723 --> 30:14.059
When I first met you,
I saw something in you.

30:16.895 --> 30:18.146
You still have it.

30:19.773 --> 30:23.110
It's a refusal to
abide by the rules.

30:25.362 --> 30:26.738
A wildness,

30:27.531 --> 30:30.075
only just contained.

30:35.956 --> 30:37.541
I still love that about you.

30:37.916 --> 30:39.710
Do you?
I do.

30:40.711 --> 30:42.671
I chose you
as my companion.

30:43.922 --> 30:45.966
I accept that you
might not love me.

30:48.593 --> 30:51.138
I know that my being
the son of Ragnar Lothbrok

30:51.847 --> 30:53.473
has little meaning to you.

30:55.392 --> 30:57.019
And I like that about you.

31:00.564 --> 31:03.066
Why do you say these
beautiful things now?

31:23.336 --> 31:24.755
Gunnar!

31:26.423 --> 31:28.258
Gunnar, I have the fish!

31:54.201 --> 31:55.535
Your move.

31:59.498 --> 32:00.874
I don't want to play.

32:00.957 --> 32:02.083
Move!

32:23.605 --> 32:25.482
That was stupid of you.

32:25.565 --> 32:26.733
You lose.

32:27.818 --> 32:29.694
Don't call me stupid!

32:30.570 --> 32:31.822
Why not?

32:32.614 --> 32:35.325
Because I'm the only reason
you're still alive.

32:41.998 --> 32:43.500
Siggy is dead.

32:45.752 --> 32:46.837
Who?

32:48.088 --> 32:50.340
I found her body
in the river.

32:52.050 --> 32:53.176
Oh, her!

32:55.929 --> 32:57.180
I thought...

32:58.515 --> 33:00.600
I thought someone
was taking care of her.

33:00.976 --> 33:02.269
No.

33:02.352 --> 33:03.687
Obviously not.

33:08.108 --> 33:09.609
Who cares?

33:23.206 --> 33:24.583
Pull!

33:27.502 --> 33:29.546
- One, two.
- Pull!

33:42.058 --> 33:43.393
This one's ready!

33:47.063 --> 33:49.232
- One, two.
- Pull!

33:49.816 --> 33:52.360
- One, two.
- Pull!

34:05.248 --> 34:06.583
Pull!

34:16.842 --> 34:21.598
In your name, All-Father,
and in your son, mighty Thor,

34:22.139 --> 34:25.435
this sacrifice
is dedicated.

34:33.150 --> 34:34.235
Come on!

34:36.947 --> 34:38.907
I don't want you
to kill Bjorn.

34:41.117 --> 34:44.286
If I agree to come back
to you, would you
give up on your revenge?

34:45.288 --> 34:47.290
A Viking never gives up
on his revenge.

34:48.291 --> 34:49.751
This is who we are.

34:50.835 --> 34:56.174
My father was killed by
Ragnar Lothbrok, and by his
son, his ex-wife, his friends.

34:57.467 --> 34:59.469
And I will have my revenge.

34:59.803 --> 35:01.846
That was a long
time ago, Erlendur.

35:04.849 --> 35:07.143
It always seems
to me like yesterday.

35:08.645 --> 35:11.982
And how perfect
to punish Ragnar
by killing his son.

35:14.192 --> 35:15.276
Yes!

35:16.361 --> 35:17.445
Yes!

35:18.488 --> 35:19.906
Today is the day!

35:20.657 --> 35:21.908
You have to kill him.

35:22.325 --> 35:24.411
No.
Yes. It's decided.

35:24.494 --> 35:26.705
The gods want you
to do it, not me.

35:28.248 --> 35:30.875
I've dedicated this
sacrificial offering
to them.

35:31.084 --> 35:32.836
Now you must drink.

35:33.169 --> 35:34.713
What if I can't do it?

35:35.588 --> 35:37.507
What if I won't do it?
I told you!

35:38.216 --> 35:39.926
I told you,
you have no choice.

35:40.010 --> 35:43.847
If you have any feelings
for your son or care
whether he lives or dies.

35:43.930 --> 35:45.515
Now, drink.

35:55.817 --> 35:56.985
Here is my crossbow.

35:57.861 --> 36:00.113
No one expects you
to be able to fire
it properly.

36:00.196 --> 36:02.574
But if you get close
enough, you can't miss.

36:03.950 --> 36:05.869
Look, here is the bolt.
It goes in here.

36:06.536 --> 36:09.372
All you have to do
is pull the trigger.

36:28.725 --> 36:29.934
Go again!

36:35.190 --> 36:37.192
- Pull!
- Yeah.

37:20.944 --> 37:22.112
Torvi.

37:25.406 --> 37:27.242
Erlendur has
told me to kill you.

37:28.284 --> 37:30.286
To revenge the death
his father.

37:51.891 --> 37:53.226
What are you waiting for?

38:35.185 --> 38:36.352
You're safe now.

41:15.094 --> 41:16.679
The boats are on the...

41:20.892 --> 41:22.185
Are you all right?

41:29.108 --> 41:30.651
I will be fine.

41:31.444 --> 41:32.528
What is it?

41:36.032 --> 41:37.450
The boats
are on the water.

41:41.120 --> 41:43.331
We are waiting
your command.

41:56.010 --> 41:57.804
It's what Yidu
gave you, isn't it?

42:02.809 --> 42:04.602
She told me
it was medicine.

42:06.479 --> 42:08.731
But now I feel
poisoned without it.

42:08.815 --> 42:10.191
Then take some more.

42:11.484 --> 42:13.611
I only have
a little bit left.

42:15.655 --> 42:17.907
I have to save it
to fight Rollo.

42:23.830 --> 42:25.081
I need you.

42:27.583 --> 42:29.419
Paris cannot be
taken without you.

42:29.794 --> 42:33.214
I don't care about Paris.

42:40.513 --> 42:41.806
I came for Rollo.

44:07.099 --> 44:08.518
I have to kill you.

44:10.269 --> 44:11.479
I must kill you.

44:13.231 --> 44:14.524
I must kill you.

44:16.526 --> 44:17.944
I have to kill you.

44:20.530 --> 44:21.864
I will kill you.
