Previously on
"The Vampire Diaries"...

00:01.671 --> 00:02.852
Turn it off.

00:02.854 --> 00:04.794
She's ruthless
without her humanity.

00:04.795 --> 00:06.196
- So, what are we gonna do?
- Lock her up.

00:06.197 --> 00:08.101
'Make her life a living hell.

00:08.102 --> 00:10.370
I was in New Orleans
trying to find information

00:10.371 --> 00:11.688
about my real parents.

00:11.689 --> 00:14.473
I've only seen that Mark
on a handful of others,

00:14.639 --> 00:16.109
all from the same werewolf clan

00:16.110 --> 00:18.245
that once thrived
throughout Louisiana.

00:18.246 --> 00:20.937
What makes you think I'll spare
your beloved Katerina?

00:20.938 --> 00:23.392
You will spare her because
I'm asking you to spare her.

00:23.393 --> 00:24.801
As your only living brother,

00:24.802 --> 00:27.954
I would ask that you provide me
with this opportunity to love.

00:27.955 --> 00:30.322
Klaus,
you have refused my freedom.

00:30.488 --> 00:32.625
In return, I have one last
thing to offer you.

00:32.627 --> 00:35.295
There is a witch in New Orleans
named Jane-Anne Deveraux

00:35.296 --> 00:38.514
plotting a move against you.
Hunt her down.

00:47.574 --> 00:50.291
That's the calmest
desiccating vampire I've ever seen.

00:50.292 --> 00:52.987
I remember when you starved
me down there for 3 days.

00:52.988 --> 00:54.670
I would've wept at
your feet for an orange peel.

00:54.671 --> 00:56.749
Look, she's not
gonna beg for blood.

00:56.751 --> 00:58.368
Begging means desperation.

00:58.369 --> 01:00.886
Emotion.
She's still in no-humanity zone.

01:00.888 --> 01:02.389
How hungry does
she have to be before we can

01:02.390 --> 01:04.057
torture some feelings
back into her?

01:04.058 --> 01:06.066
A lot hungrier than she is now,
apparently.

01:06.410 --> 01:08.169
So, what are we supposed
to do in the meantime?

01:08.170 --> 01:10.513
Maybe I can provide
a little excitement.

01:10.515 --> 01:11.465
Katherine.

01:11.466 --> 01:14.074
The one and only.
Sort of.

01:14.652 --> 01:16.268
So, when's the welcome home party?

01:17.521 --> 01:20.439
Wow. Look who
went and got bold.

01:20.441 --> 01:23.493
Last time I checked, Klaus was
plotting your eternal demise.

01:23.494 --> 01:25.210
Well,
it doesn't matter anymore,

01:25.376 --> 01:27.697
because Klaus is gone.

01:27.698 --> 01:29.260
Wait. What do you mean he's gone?

01:29.261 --> 01:31.668
Let's just say
that werewolf girl Hayley

01:31.669 --> 01:33.954
turned out to be just
the thing we needed

01:33.955 --> 01:37.340
to get Klaus out of
our lives for good.

02:00.897 --> 02:02.539
Third time in here this week.

02:02.540 --> 02:04.951
I'm obsessed with The Gumbo,
Jane-Anne.

02:04.952 --> 02:07.454
The old ladies in the ninth ward
say my sister Sophie

02:07.455 --> 02:10.211
bleeds a piece of her
soul into every dish.

02:10.213 --> 02:12.592
I asked around
the quarter about my family.

02:12.593 --> 02:15.295
- And?
- Nothing. Zero.

02:15.296 --> 02:17.747
Can't find a single
person who remembers them.

02:17.748 --> 02:21.641
Because, Hayley, people like you
were run out of here years ago.

02:23.637 --> 02:25.469
What do you mean, people like me?

02:34.264 --> 02:37.467
In the Bayou,
they call the werewolves

02:37.468 --> 02:38.492
Roux-Ga-Roux.

02:39.742 --> 02:41.071
You head out there,

02:41.072 --> 02:42.621
you'll find what
you're looking for.

02:44.413 --> 02:45.492
Be careful.

02:45.493 --> 02:47.476
It's the last place
you'd ever want to go.

03:07.047 --> 03:09.049
Don't do it.
Please.

03:09.050 --> 03:10.427
What if I'm wrong about her?

03:10.428 --> 03:12.769
That's the beauty of you.
You're never wrong.

03:12.770 --> 03:14.771
She's the only way
we're gonna get to Klaus.

03:14.772 --> 03:16.189
Can we get someone
else to do the spell?

03:16.190 --> 03:17.774
Who? Half the witches
don't believe you.

03:17.775 --> 03:19.391
The other half are too scared.

03:19.393 --> 03:21.611
Because they know we're
gonna get caught, Jane-Anne.

03:21.612 --> 03:23.370
We don't have any other option.

03:26.399 --> 03:28.784
Now go.
You know what you need to do.

04:10.360 --> 04:12.494
What the... uhh!

04:22.803 --> 04:24.623
Are you kidding me?

04:38.938 --> 04:40.989
Hey, I'm looking for a tow service.

04:43.861 --> 04:46.696
Aah!

05:19.696 --> 05:22.155
Welcome to the dark side
of New Orleans,

05:22.566 --> 05:24.027
a supernatural playground

05:24.028 --> 05:26.403
where the living are easily lost

05:26.404 --> 05:28.905
and the dead stick around and play.

05:30.441 --> 05:31.825
New Orleans?

05:31.826 --> 05:34.457
What the hell
is Klaus doing there?

05:34.458 --> 05:37.045
Evidently, there are witches
conspiring against him.

05:37.581 --> 05:38.915
So, knowing our brother,

05:38.916 --> 05:41.084
this was a mission
to silence and slaughter.

05:47.257 --> 05:48.541
Well, the
French quarter witches

05:48.542 --> 05:50.141
are not a lot to be trifled with.

05:50.307 --> 05:51.511
You don't suppose
they've found a way

05:51.512 --> 05:53.063
to kill him once
and for all, do you?

05:53.064 --> 05:54.681
Rebekah, in the name of our family,

05:54.682 --> 05:56.544
you might try to
dial down your glee.

05:56.545 --> 05:57.956
What family?

05:57.957 --> 06:01.255
We are 3 distrustful acquaintances
who happen to share a bloodline.

06:01.256 --> 06:02.555
I for one hope they've found a way

06:02.556 --> 06:04.531
to make that traitorous
bastard rot.

06:05.109 --> 06:07.701
Good afternoon.
Time for one more?

06:07.867 --> 06:09.312
I have nothing to say to you.

06:09.313 --> 06:11.564
Oh, now, that's not
very amiable, is it?

06:11.565 --> 06:12.766
You don't even know me.

06:12.767 --> 06:14.200
I know what you are.

06:14.201 --> 06:15.875
Half-vampire, half-beast.

06:16.041 --> 06:17.286
You're the hybrid.

06:17.288 --> 06:19.205
I'm the original hybrid, actually,

06:19.206 --> 06:20.964
but that's a long
story for another time.

06:21.408 --> 06:22.709
Where are you going?

06:22.710 --> 06:25.301
To find out who's making a move
against our father,

06:25.302 --> 06:27.547
and then...

06:27.548 --> 06:29.699
I'll either stop them,

06:29.700 --> 06:31.133
or I'll help them.

06:32.502 --> 06:33.702
Depending on my mood.

06:34.894 --> 06:37.147
I'm looking for someone.
A witch.

06:37.313 --> 06:39.524
Perhaps you might be
able to help me find her.

06:39.877 --> 06:41.985
Jane-Anne Deveraux.

06:43.980 --> 06:45.113
Sorry. I don't know.

06:47.216 --> 06:49.268
Well, now, that's a fib, isn't it?

06:51.321 --> 06:54.278
Now, you see... I know

06:54.279 --> 06:57.417
that you're a true witch
amongst this sea of poseurs.

06:57.962 --> 07:01.230
So, enough with the fabrications.

07:01.231 --> 07:02.797
I've quite a temper.

07:03.284 --> 07:05.869
Witches don't talk outta
school in the quarter.

07:05.870 --> 07:07.635
The vampire won't allow it.

07:08.005 --> 07:09.622
Those are the rules.

07:09.623 --> 07:11.806
I don't break Marcel's rules.

07:14.177 --> 07:16.077
Marcel's rules?

07:18.298 --> 07:23.526
Where do you suppose
I might find Marcel?

07:54.717 --> 07:56.219
Thank you.

08:12.802 --> 08:13.903
Klaus.

08:13.904 --> 08:15.188
Marcel.

08:15.189 --> 08:17.357
Must be 100 years since
that nasty business

08:17.358 --> 08:18.908
with your papa.

08:18.909 --> 08:20.276
Has it been that long?

08:20.277 --> 08:22.662
Way I recall it,
he ran you out of town.

08:22.663 --> 08:24.878
Left a trail of dead
vampires in his wake.

08:24.879 --> 08:27.675
And yet how fortunate
you managed to survive.

08:27.676 --> 08:31.344
My father, I'm afraid,
I recently incinerated to dust.

08:37.176 --> 08:38.928
Well, if I'd known you
were coming back in town,

08:38.929 --> 08:39.929
if I had a heads-up...

08:39.929 --> 08:41.895
What, Marcel?

08:45.551 --> 08:46.935
What would you have done?

08:50.189 --> 08:53.026
I'd have thrown you a damn parade.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.396
Ha ha!

08:56.397 --> 08:58.063
Niklaus Mikaelson.

08:58.065 --> 09:00.748
My mentor, my savior, my sire.

09:01.184 --> 09:02.401
Let's get you a drink.

09:04.585 --> 09:06.372
Yeah-eah-eah.

09:06.373 --> 09:09.625
- It is good to see you.
- It's good to be home.

09:09.627 --> 09:11.661
Although please tell me
the current state of bourbon street

09:11.662 --> 09:12.996
is not your doing.

09:12.997 --> 09:14.964
Ha ha ha ha!
Something's gotta

09:14.965 --> 09:17.891
draw in the out-of-towners,
otherwise, we'd all go hungry.

09:20.100 --> 09:22.220
I see your friends are daywalkers.

09:22.222 --> 09:24.223
Yeah, yeah, I shared the secret

09:24.224 --> 09:26.426
of your daylight ring
with a few buddies.

09:26.427 --> 09:27.710
Just the inner circle, though.

09:27.711 --> 09:29.095
The family.

09:29.096 --> 09:32.432
Tell me.
How did you

09:32.433 --> 09:34.782
find a witch willing to
make daylight rings?

09:35.235 --> 09:38.490
I got the witches here
wrapped around my finger.

09:38.491 --> 09:41.998
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Is that so?

09:44.610 --> 09:48.956
I'm looking for a witch
by the name of Jane-Anne Deveraux.

09:48.957 --> 09:52.550
- Has some business with me.
- Looking for Jane-Anne?

09:56.089 --> 09:57.805
Then you probably
oughta come with me.

09:59.909 --> 10:02.168
Ha ha! Showtime!

10:12.922 --> 10:14.140
How's the family?

10:14.141 --> 10:16.059
Those who live hate
me more than ever.

10:16.060 --> 10:17.944
Forget them.
If your blood relations

10:17.945 --> 10:19.428
let you down, you make
your own, huh?

10:19.429 --> 10:20.697
You taught me that.

10:20.698 --> 10:23.706
And what's mine
is yours, as always.

10:23.872 --> 10:26.401
Even my nightwalkers,
the riff-raff.

10:28.237 --> 10:29.654
They're hardly subtle, are they?

10:29.656 --> 10:30.672
It's the quarter.

10:30.838 --> 10:33.007
Ain't no such thing
as subtle, baby.

10:41.584 --> 10:43.586
Jane-Anne Deveraux.

10:46.854 --> 10:49.058
Give it up for Jane-Anne.
Come on.

10:50.060 --> 10:51.476
Yeah.

10:51.478 --> 10:53.429
Jane-Anne Deveraux,

10:53.430 --> 10:56.556
you have been accused
of the practice of witchcraft

10:56.557 --> 11:02.438
beyond the bounds of the rules
set forth and enforced by me.

11:02.439 --> 11:04.657
How do you plead? Oh.

11:04.658 --> 11:06.526
Was that convincing?
I studied law

11:06.527 --> 11:08.026
back in the fifties.

11:08.028 --> 11:09.078
It's all I know.

11:09.079 --> 11:10.495
Seriously, J, tick tock.

11:10.497 --> 11:12.703
You know the drill.
How do you plead?

11:12.704 --> 11:14.257
I didn't do anything.

11:17.176 --> 11:21.007
That's a lie.
You know it, I know it,

11:21.008 --> 11:23.376
and you hate that I know it.

11:23.377 --> 11:27.168
It drives you witches crazy
that I'm aware of your every move.

11:27.169 --> 11:29.689
That you can't do
magic in this town

11:29.967 --> 11:31.601
without getting caught.

11:31.602 --> 11:35.771
So, why don't we just
cut to the chase, huh?

11:40.699 --> 11:44.397
You tell me what magic
you're brewing.

11:44.398 --> 11:47.682
Tell me.
I'll grant you leniency.

11:50.069 --> 11:53.379
Hey, I am, after all,
a merciful man.

11:55.124 --> 11:56.674
Rot in hell, monster.

12:03.749 --> 12:06.252
I'll tell you what.

12:06.253 --> 12:08.170
I'll give you one more chance.

12:14.677 --> 12:15.844
Or not.

12:25.105 --> 12:27.322
Yeah!

12:40.852 --> 12:41.818
What was that?

12:41.820 --> 12:44.855
Hey. Come walk with me.

12:44.856 --> 12:46.807
Witches aren't
allowed to do magic here.

12:46.808 --> 12:48.442
She broke the rules.

12:48.443 --> 12:51.362
I told you I wanted to talk to her.

12:51.363 --> 12:53.864
Hey, I'm sorry.
I got caught up in the show.

12:53.865 --> 12:56.500
Those witches, they think that
they still have power in this town.

12:56.501 --> 12:58.502
I have to show them
that they don't.

12:58.503 --> 13:01.489
I never waste an opportunity
for a show of force.

13:01.655 --> 13:04.324
Another lesson that
I learned from you.

13:04.741 --> 13:07.294
And besides, anything that you
could've gotten out of her,

13:07.295 --> 13:10.580
I can find out for you, and I will.
I promise.

13:18.138 --> 13:22.558
Well, whatever it was,
doesn't matter anymore, does it?

13:24.728 --> 13:26.730
Good. Then let's eat,

13:26.731 --> 13:29.149
because all that spilled
blood makes me hungry.

13:29.150 --> 13:30.283
Ha ha!

13:37.399 --> 13:39.743
Hey. Thierry, isn't it?

13:39.744 --> 13:42.995
Any more Deveraux witches
where she came from?

13:56.827 --> 13:59.336
- You're Klaus.
- I am.

14:00.047 --> 14:03.733
And you're upset.
Sophie, isn't it?

14:03.735 --> 14:05.185
I assume this is because of

14:05.186 --> 14:06.637
what I just witnessed
with your sister

14:06.638 --> 14:08.855
on the corner of Royal and St. Ann.

14:08.856 --> 14:10.214
Did you enjoy the show?

14:10.215 --> 14:12.560
It was a little
melodramatic for my tastes.

14:14.728 --> 14:17.915
What did your sister want with me?

14:17.916 --> 14:19.532
Why did Marcel kill her?

14:24.171 --> 14:25.705
I see you brought friends.

14:31.879 --> 14:33.130
They're not with me.

14:33.131 --> 14:34.348
They're with Marcel.

14:34.349 --> 14:35.750
That's all that matters.

14:35.916 --> 14:37.301
I know you built this town,

14:37.302 --> 14:39.770
but this is his town now.

14:39.771 --> 14:43.474
He killed my sister because
she broke the rules.

14:43.475 --> 14:47.094
So, I talk to you in
front of him, I'm next.

14:54.735 --> 14:57.654
Are you two gentlemen following me?

14:57.655 --> 15:00.791
Marcel said we're your guides.

15:00.792 --> 15:03.293
Oh, he did, did he?
He did.

15:03.294 --> 15:06.225
Well, then, let me be exceedingly
clear about something.

15:06.226 --> 15:07.905
If either of you
following me again,

15:07.906 --> 15:10.083
you'll do so without
the benefit of a spine.

15:10.084 --> 15:11.218
Sorry for the wait.

15:11.219 --> 15:13.833
If you're here for the gumbo,
I'm about to break your heart.

15:13.834 --> 15:15.005
We just ran out.

15:15.006 --> 15:18.123
Your oldest scotch
for my two friends here, love.

15:21.929 --> 15:24.398
Marcel wants to know
what I'm up to,

15:24.399 --> 15:26.066
he can ask me himself.

16:08.275 --> 16:11.175
- The doors work, you know.
- You doing magic?

16:12.863 --> 16:14.614
I'm praying to my dead sister.

16:14.616 --> 16:16.616
Go ahead.
Pay your respects.

16:17.734 --> 16:19.460
Don't make this a thing, Sophie.

16:19.461 --> 16:21.371
The hybrid was
looking for Jane-Anne.

16:21.372 --> 16:22.843
Marcel wants to know why.

16:22.844 --> 16:25.113
Oh, that sounds
like witch business.

16:25.493 --> 16:27.227
I'd say ask her yourself, but

16:27.228 --> 16:29.947
I guess you can't seeing
as how Marcel killed her.

16:59.526 --> 17:00.686
I'm Elijah.

17:03.163 --> 17:04.280
You've heard of me?

17:05.832 --> 17:06.776
Yes.

17:08.669 --> 17:10.170
So, why don't you
tell me what business

17:10.171 --> 17:11.904
your family has with my brother?

18:00.162 --> 18:01.150
Where's Marcel?

18:01.152 --> 18:02.498
Who the hell's asking?

18:02.664 --> 18:04.000
I assume you're joking.

18:04.539 --> 18:07.007
I only answer to Marcel.

18:07.008 --> 18:09.826
Well, then, in that case,
perhaps you'll answer to this.

18:09.827 --> 18:12.119
You're aware the bite of
a werewolf can kill a vampire?

18:12.120 --> 18:14.181
Well, as you can see,
I'm half-werewolf,

18:14.182 --> 18:16.333
so I'm gonna ask you one more time!

18:16.334 --> 18:17.935
Where is Marcel?

18:18.346 --> 18:20.271
H-hey.
I'm right here.

18:20.682 --> 18:23.190
I'm right here.
Easy, now.

18:23.191 --> 18:24.725
Diego's just looking out for me.

18:24.726 --> 18:27.394
Nobody harms my guys.
Those are the rules.

18:27.395 --> 18:29.980
I don't care about
your rules, Marcel.

18:29.981 --> 18:32.066
I don't need chaperones.

18:32.067 --> 18:33.904
Why are you having me followed?

18:35.124 --> 18:36.819
Come here.

18:36.820 --> 18:39.391
I get it, huh? Show of force.
You made your point.

18:39.392 --> 18:43.293
Let it go, friend.
For me.

18:44.912 --> 18:49.500
Fine. Why don't you show me
what you've done with the place

18:49.501 --> 18:51.385
while you explain
exactly what it is

18:51.386 --> 18:53.169
you've been up to in my town.

18:55.639 --> 18:57.707
Follow me.

19:08.271 --> 19:10.237
Look at that skyline.

19:10.238 --> 19:12.256
That there, that's progress.

19:12.257 --> 19:15.693
More hotels, more tourists,
more fresh blood.

19:16.029 --> 19:17.928
And the humans?
I taught them

19:17.929 --> 19:19.479
to look the other way.

19:19.480 --> 19:20.996
And what of the witches?

19:20.997 --> 19:23.167
In my time, they were
a force to be reckoned with,

19:23.168 --> 19:25.139
and now they live in fear.

19:26.004 --> 19:28.282
How do you know when
they're using magic?

19:28.283 --> 19:31.875
Maybe I got a secret weapon,
an ace up my sleeve,

19:31.876 --> 19:33.594
something that gives
me complete control

19:33.595 --> 19:35.628
over all the magic in this town.

19:35.629 --> 19:37.509
Hmm. Is that a fact?

19:37.510 --> 19:40.033
Might be.
Or maybe I'm just bluffing.

19:45.922 --> 19:47.599
You take vervain?

19:47.600 --> 19:49.360
'Burns like a bitch.

19:49.361 --> 19:50.644
But I figure I should limit

19:50.645 --> 19:52.691
the number of things
I'm vulnerable to.

19:54.109 --> 19:56.199
Don't be mad about
that chaperone thing.

19:56.201 --> 19:58.405
I told my guys to look out for you,
that's all.

19:58.703 --> 20:01.450
That's what we do here...
Look out for each other.

20:03.243 --> 20:07.378
Mmmmm.
New blood.

20:07.379 --> 20:11.377
The bartender,
walking alone at night.

20:11.750 --> 20:14.951
She's either brave or dumb.

20:14.952 --> 20:17.170
Let's see. Brave, I let her live,

20:17.172 --> 20:19.088
dumb, she's dessert.

20:22.259 --> 20:24.723
You know, it's not safe here alone.

20:24.889 --> 20:27.268
You know, I have
a black belt in karate.

20:32.236 --> 20:33.686
Evening, Elijah.

20:34.938 --> 20:36.155
Niklaus.

20:36.157 --> 20:38.825
What an entirely
unwelcome surprise.

20:38.827 --> 20:41.812
And what an entirely
unsurprising welcome.

20:41.813 --> 20:42.780
Come with me.

20:42.781 --> 20:44.331
I'm not going anywhere.

20:44.332 --> 20:47.288
Not until I find out who's
conspiring against me.

20:47.752 --> 20:49.869
I believe I just found
that out for you.

20:56.627 --> 20:58.261
What are we doing here?

20:58.263 --> 21:01.093
Want to know what the witches have
in store for you?

21:01.433 --> 21:02.598
Follow me.

21:09.807 --> 21:11.525
Sophie Deveraux.

21:11.526 --> 21:12.693
What is this?

21:12.694 --> 21:15.010
He's all yours.
Proceed.

21:17.064 --> 21:18.917
You know you're
famous in this town?

21:18.918 --> 21:22.823
Witches tell bedtime stories
about the powerful vampire Klaus.

21:23.204 --> 21:26.039
We know Marcel was nothing
but an orphaned street rat

21:26.409 --> 21:28.325
until you made him what he is.

21:28.326 --> 21:29.872
And now he's out of control.

21:30.038 --> 21:33.046
He does what he wants.
He kills who he wants.

21:33.047 --> 21:34.630
I'm gonna stop him...

21:35.666 --> 21:37.445
And you're gonna help me.

21:41.581 --> 21:43.976
- This is why you brought me here.
- Hear her out.

21:43.977 --> 21:45.314
I don't need to hear her out.

21:45.315 --> 21:47.670
I assure you, love,
there is not a thing on this earth

21:47.662 --> 21:48.846
that will matter
enough for me to waste

21:48.847 --> 21:51.265
even 30 more seconds of my time.

21:51.266 --> 21:54.150
- Elijah, what madness is this?
- Klaus...

21:57.938 --> 21:59.985
You need to listen to them.

22:05.682 --> 22:06.947
You're all out of your minds

22:06.948 --> 22:09.532
if you think some liquor-fueled
one-night stand...

22:09.534 --> 22:11.752
No offense, sweetheart...
Means a thing to me.

22:11.753 --> 22:13.287
Marcel may be
able to keep us

22:13.288 --> 22:16.006
from practicing
real magic in this town,

22:16.007 --> 22:17.939
but as keepers of the balance,

22:17.940 --> 22:20.622
we still know when nature
has cooked up something new.

22:20.623 --> 22:26.215
For example, I have a special gift,
of sensing when a girl is pregnant.

22:31.855 --> 22:32.856
What?

22:32.857 --> 22:34.770
I know.
It's impossible.

22:36.777 --> 22:39.362
- What are you saying?
- Niklaus...

22:41.782 --> 22:43.900
The girl is carrying your child.

22:56.094 --> 22:58.393
No.
It's impossible.

22:58.395 --> 23:01.947
- Vampires cannot procreate.
- But werewolves can.

23:01.948 --> 23:05.884
Magic made you a vampire,
but you were born a werewolf.

23:06.319 --> 23:07.736
You're the original hybrid,

23:07.737 --> 23:10.239
the first of your kind,
and this pregnancy

23:10.240 --> 23:12.874
is one of nature's loopholes.

23:16.462 --> 23:18.414
You've been with someone else.
Admit it!

23:18.415 --> 23:22.167
Hey. I spent days held captive
in a freakin' alligator bayou

23:22.168 --> 23:23.683
because they think
that I'm carrying

23:23.684 --> 23:25.019
some magical miracle baby.

23:25.020 --> 23:27.722
Don't you think I would've
fessed up if it wasn't yours?

23:27.724 --> 23:29.474
My sister gave her life

23:29.476 --> 23:31.393
to perform the spell
she needed to confirm

23:31.394 --> 23:32.637
this pregnancy.

23:32.638 --> 23:34.580
Because of Jane-Anne's sacrifice,

23:34.581 --> 23:37.760
the lives of this girl and her baby
are now controlled by us.

23:39.351 --> 23:41.779
If you don't help us
take down Marcel,

23:41.780 --> 23:44.606
so help me,
Hayley won't live long enough

23:44.607 --> 23:46.091
to see her first maternity dress.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.476
Wait, what?

23:47.477 --> 23:49.528
Enough of this,
if you want Marcel dead, he's dead.

23:49.529 --> 23:50.529
I'll do it myself.

23:50.530 --> 23:52.981
No. We can't.
Not yet.

23:52.982 --> 23:55.284
We have a clear plan
that we need to follow

23:55.285 --> 23:56.643
and there are rules.

24:02.257 --> 24:04.818
How dare you command me?

24:06.094 --> 24:07.880
Threaten me

24:07.881 --> 24:10.549
with what you wrongfully
perceive to be my weaknesses?

24:10.550 --> 24:12.134
I won't hear any more lies.

24:12.135 --> 24:13.768
Niklaus.

24:21.226 --> 24:22.644
Listen.

25:09.992 --> 25:12.677
Kill her and the baby.

25:13.996 --> 25:14.972
What do I care?

25:23.205 --> 25:26.335
Niklaus
- it's a trick, Elijah.

25:26.336 --> 25:27.921
No, brother.
It's a gift.

25:27.922 --> 25:30.545
It's your chance.
It's our chance.

25:31.769 --> 25:33.323
To what?
To start over.

25:33.324 --> 25:36.242
Take back everything we lost.
Everything that was taken from us.

25:37.053 --> 25:40.152
Niklaus, our own parents
came to despise us.

25:40.153 --> 25:42.221
Our family was ruined,
we were ruined,

25:42.222 --> 25:43.994
and since then,
all that you have ever wanted,

25:43.995 --> 25:46.227
all that we have ever wanted,

25:46.229 --> 25:47.862
was a family.

25:51.950 --> 25:55.153
I will not be manipulated.

25:55.154 --> 25:57.289
So, they're manipuniting you.
So what?

25:57.290 --> 25:59.825
With them, this girl and her child,

25:59.826 --> 26:03.980
your child... live.

26:05.547 --> 26:08.643
I'm gonna kill
every last one of them.

26:09.635 --> 26:11.803
And then what?
Then you return to Mystic Falls

26:11.804 --> 26:13.422
to resume your life
as the hated one,

26:13.423 --> 26:14.590
as the evil hybrid?

26:14.591 --> 26:15.957
Is it so important
to you that people

26:15.958 --> 26:17.726
quake with fear at
the sound of your name?

26:17.727 --> 26:19.628
People quake with fear
because I have the power

26:19.629 --> 26:21.063
to make them afraid.

26:21.064 --> 26:24.033
What will this child offer me?
Will it guarantee me power?

26:24.034 --> 26:26.401
Family is power, Niklaus.

26:26.402 --> 26:28.904
Love, loyalty.
It's power.

26:28.905 --> 26:30.238
This is what we
swore to one another

26:30.239 --> 26:31.907
a thousand years ago,
before life tore away

26:31.908 --> 26:33.929
what little humanity you had left,

26:33.930 --> 26:36.882
before ego, before anger,
before paranoia

26:36.883 --> 26:39.414
created in this person before me...

26:39.415 --> 26:42.450
Someone I can barely even recognize
as my own brother.

26:46.505 --> 26:50.625
This is us.
The Original family.

26:52.944 --> 26:56.823
We remain together,
always and forever.

27:00.719 --> 27:03.388
I am asking you to stay here.

27:03.389 --> 27:05.974
I will help you
and I will stand by you.

27:05.975 --> 27:08.000
I will be your brother.

27:08.001 --> 27:10.444
We will build a home here together.

27:11.730 --> 27:13.544
So, save this girl.

27:15.767 --> 27:17.609
Save your child.

27:27.829 --> 27:29.051
No.

27:42.763 --> 27:44.429
He's doing what he does.

27:45.381 --> 27:46.716
Given a chance at happiness,

27:46.717 --> 27:48.600
Klaus runs in
the opposite direction.

27:48.602 --> 27:49.719
Then let him run.

27:49.720 --> 27:52.188
That child, if it's even his,
is better off without him.

27:52.189 --> 27:54.273
He's not better off
without that child, Rebekah,

27:54.274 --> 27:55.340
and neither are we.

27:55.342 --> 27:57.375
Darling, kind Elijah.

27:57.377 --> 28:00.780
Our brother rarely brings
us anything but pain.

28:00.781 --> 28:02.531
At what point in your immortal life

28:02.532 --> 28:04.600
will you stop searching
for his redemption?

28:06.068 --> 28:08.254
I'll stop searching
for his redemption

28:08.255 --> 28:10.572
when I believe there is
none left to be found.

28:19.582 --> 28:20.750
I'd give you a play-by-play,

28:20.751 --> 28:23.269
but you have the air of someone
who's been lurking and listening.

28:23.270 --> 28:25.838
He'll come around.
You know Elijah.

28:25.839 --> 28:28.704
He won't stop until he's convinced
Klaus to do the right thing.

28:28.705 --> 28:31.677
I know you consider yourself
an expert in brotherly dynamics,

28:31.678 --> 28:34.380
but you don't know my brothers
half as well as you think you do.

28:34.381 --> 28:36.482
You're wrong.

28:36.483 --> 28:38.551
Klaus won't be able to
walk away from this.

28:38.552 --> 28:40.356
He and I are the same.

28:40.357 --> 28:43.439
We manipulate, we thirst for power,

28:43.440 --> 28:45.124
we control, we punish,

28:45.125 --> 28:46.242
but our actions are driven by

28:46.243 --> 28:48.610
one singular place deep inside.

28:48.612 --> 28:49.811
And what's that?

28:50.360 --> 28:53.281
We're alone.
And we hate it.

28:56.919 --> 28:59.205
Tell Elijah to call
me when he comes home.

28:59.206 --> 29:00.738
I'll be waiting for him.

29:12.969 --> 29:15.014
Hey, man.
Where'd you run off to?

29:15.015 --> 29:18.340
You mean your minions aren't still
documenting my every move?

29:19.309 --> 29:21.944
Someone put you in a mood.
What can I do?

29:21.945 --> 29:23.312
What you can do is you can tell me

29:23.313 --> 29:25.197
what this thing is you
have with the witches.

29:25.198 --> 29:28.484
- We're back to that?
- Yeah, we're back to that.

29:28.485 --> 29:30.102
You know I owe you
everything I got,

29:30.103 --> 29:32.896
but I'm afraid I have to
draw the line on this one.

29:33.407 --> 29:34.957
This is my business.

29:34.958 --> 29:36.740
I control the witches in my town.

29:36.741 --> 29:38.043
Let's just leave it at that.

29:39.161 --> 29:41.223
- Your town?
- Damn straight.

29:41.224 --> 29:44.050
That's funny.

29:44.051 --> 29:46.635
Because when I left 100 years ago,

29:46.636 --> 29:48.503
you were just a pathetic
little scrapper

29:48.505 --> 29:50.506
still trembling from
the lashes of the whips

29:50.507 --> 29:52.024
of those who would keep you down,

29:52.025 --> 29:53.092
and now look at you.

29:53.093 --> 29:55.293
Master of your domain.

29:55.628 --> 29:57.087
Prince of the city.

29:59.815 --> 30:02.676
- I'd like to know how.
- Why?

30:04.353 --> 30:05.612
Jealous?

30:09.075 --> 30:10.693
Hey, man, I get it.

30:10.694 --> 30:12.328
300 years ago, you helped build

30:12.329 --> 30:14.697
a backwater penal
colony into something.

30:14.698 --> 30:16.556
You started it, but then you left.

30:16.557 --> 30:18.358
Actually, you ran from it.

30:18.869 --> 30:21.670
I saw it through.
Look around.

30:21.671 --> 30:23.335
Vampires rule this city now.

30:23.336 --> 30:26.509
We don't have to live in
the shadows like rats.

30:26.510 --> 30:28.594
The locals know their place.
They look the other way.

30:28.595 --> 30:30.463
I got rid of the werewolves.

30:30.464 --> 30:32.585
I even found a way to
shut down the witches.

30:32.586 --> 30:36.209
The blood never stops flowing
and the party never ends.

30:36.636 --> 30:40.306
You want to pass on through?
You want to stay a while? Great.

30:40.307 --> 30:44.212
What's mine is yours,
but it is mine.

30:44.213 --> 30:48.229
My home, my family, my rules.

30:50.066 --> 30:54.120
- And if someone breaks those rules?
- They die.

30:54.121 --> 30:55.571
Mercy is for the weak.

30:55.572 --> 30:56.885
You taught me that, too.

30:58.075 --> 31:01.794
And I'm not the Prince
of the quarter, friend.

31:01.795 --> 31:03.078
I'm the King!

31:04.330 --> 31:06.414
Show me some respect.

31:27.983 --> 31:30.639
Your friend will be
dead by the weekend.

31:31.057 --> 31:34.078
Which means I've broken
one of your rules.

31:35.611 --> 31:37.895
And yet I cannot be killed.

31:40.699 --> 31:42.708
I am immortal.

31:45.671 --> 31:48.791
Who has the power now, friend?

32:58.110 --> 32:59.561
The hundred dollar guy.

33:00.913 --> 33:02.413
The brave bartender.

33:05.701 --> 33:08.320
Camille.
That's a French name.

33:08.622 --> 33:12.208
It's a grandma's name.
Call me Cami.

33:12.209 --> 33:13.783
Amazing, isn't he?

33:14.710 --> 33:16.545
Do you paint?

33:16.546 --> 33:18.892
No, but I admire.

33:21.050 --> 33:22.667
Every artist has a story, you know.

33:23.103 --> 33:25.603
And what do you
suppose his story is?

33:29.225 --> 33:33.553
He's... angry.
Dark.

33:33.554 --> 33:36.326
Doesn't feel safe and doesn't know
what to do about it.

33:37.450 --> 33:39.618
He wishes he could
control his demons

33:39.619 --> 33:42.287
instead of having
his demons control him.

33:44.490 --> 33:45.607
He's lost.

33:47.276 --> 33:48.170
Alone.

33:52.831 --> 33:56.585
Or... maybe he just
drank too much tonight.

33:56.586 --> 33:59.829
Sorry. Overzealous psych major.

34:01.307 --> 34:02.473
No.

34:03.809 --> 34:06.162
I think you were probably
right the first time.

34:12.351 --> 34:14.438
So...

34:48.270 --> 34:50.022
Are you here to give
me another pep talk

34:50.023 --> 34:51.889
on the joys of fatherhood?

34:53.108 --> 34:55.300
I've said
all I needed to say.

34:58.530 --> 35:00.832
I forgot how much
I liked this town.

35:02.735 --> 35:03.935
I didn't forget.

35:05.871 --> 35:07.823
All the centuries
we've spent together,

35:07.824 --> 35:09.825
and yet I can count on one hand

35:09.826 --> 35:13.069
the number of times that our family
has been truly happy.

35:13.380 --> 35:14.996
I hated leaving here.

35:17.716 --> 35:19.117
As did I.

35:23.389 --> 35:25.173
What is on your mind, brother?

35:29.178 --> 35:33.348
For a thousand years,
I lived in fear.

35:35.050 --> 35:37.469
Any time I settled anywhere,

35:37.470 --> 35:42.251
our father would hunt me
down and... chase me off.

35:42.252 --> 35:45.577
He made me feel powerless,

35:45.578 --> 35:47.695
and I hated it.

35:49.365 --> 35:52.692
This town was my home once,

35:52.858 --> 35:54.937
and in my absence,
Marcel has gotten

35:54.938 --> 35:57.206
everything that I ever wanted.

35:57.207 --> 36:03.278
Power, loyalty, family.

36:04.130 --> 36:07.591
I made him in my image
and he has bettered me.

36:09.468 --> 36:11.377
I want what he has.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.410
I want to be King.

36:21.397 --> 36:23.481
And what of Hayley and the baby?

36:28.708 --> 36:30.977
Every King needs an heir.

36:44.407 --> 36:46.625
So, how do you
propose this will work?

36:46.626 --> 36:49.365
Your brother needs to cement
his place in Marcel's world.

36:49.366 --> 36:51.650
His inner circle, the daywalkers...

36:51.651 --> 36:52.817
That's where we begin.

36:52.819 --> 36:55.487
They're his friends.
His family.

36:55.488 --> 36:57.872
We'll be hitting him
where it hurts.

37:01.510 --> 37:03.972
I had time to
sleep on it last night.

37:05.447 --> 37:07.166
I'm not your enemy.

37:07.167 --> 37:10.768
Where my family and I
failed this town...

37:12.271 --> 37:13.815
Marcel succeeded.

37:24.366 --> 37:26.345
My blood will heal him.

37:27.987 --> 37:29.604
As though it never happened.

37:44.036 --> 37:45.955
The quarter is your home,

37:45.956 --> 37:48.457
but I would like to stay a while,

37:48.458 --> 37:50.471
if I'm still welcome.

38:24.043 --> 38:27.296
Caroline.
I'm standing in one of

38:27.297 --> 38:29.098
my favorite places in the world,

38:29.499 --> 38:34.003
surrounded by food,
music, art, culture,

38:34.004 --> 38:35.754
and all I can think about

38:35.755 --> 38:37.755
is how much I want
to show it to you.

38:39.808 --> 38:41.309
Maybe one day you'll let me.

38:48.350 --> 38:49.618
So, that's it?

38:49.619 --> 38:50.836
I'm just supposed
to pack up my things

38:50.837 --> 38:52.271
and leave for good?

38:52.272 --> 38:54.463
Forget my life here
and my pursuit of the cure?

38:54.464 --> 38:55.941
The cure was a fool's errand.

38:55.942 --> 38:58.027
I mean, taking it would've
stripped you of everything you are

38:58.028 --> 39:00.245
for what?
More High School proms?

39:00.246 --> 39:01.914
I wanted to be human.

39:01.915 --> 39:03.777
I wanted children and a family.

39:03.778 --> 39:06.868
And I stand before you
to offer you both.

39:06.870 --> 39:09.171
And if I decide against you?

39:09.172 --> 39:11.405
A dagger in my heart
and then back in a box?

39:14.543 --> 39:16.344
I've made my case.

39:16.346 --> 39:19.181
Your family needs you.

39:19.182 --> 39:22.016
And what choice you make
right now is your own.

39:34.196 --> 39:36.482
I owe him nothing.

39:36.483 --> 39:39.200
I wish him no joy.
No love.

39:39.202 --> 39:40.953
I will stay here and live my life

39:40.954 --> 39:42.371
the way I want to,
and if you're smart,

39:42.372 --> 39:44.021
I suggest you do the same.

39:51.547 --> 39:53.081
She's right.

39:55.918 --> 39:58.087
Be smart, Elijah.

39:58.088 --> 40:00.139
Klaus is stark raving mad,

40:00.140 --> 40:02.403
not to mention
completely irredeemable.

40:02.404 --> 40:04.927
Leave him to set off
on this new adventure

40:04.928 --> 40:08.564
and let's you and I go out on ours.

40:08.565 --> 40:13.102
I have lost so much
of my life to Klaus.

40:13.103 --> 40:14.301
So have you.

40:19.575 --> 40:23.361
It's our turn.
Elijah, please.

40:24.780 --> 40:26.197
Katerina...

40:41.420 --> 40:42.738
Good bye.

40:53.308 --> 40:55.227
You look terrible.

40:55.228 --> 40:58.564
I'm hungry.
Not that you care.

40:58.565 --> 41:01.450
But I do.
That's the whole point.

41:01.451 --> 41:04.128
I do care.
You don't care.

41:04.621 --> 41:06.454
It's about time for that to change.

41:20.310 --> 41:22.615
Vervain.

41:23.563 --> 41:26.758
How does that make you feel?
Hurt because I'd betray you?

41:27.057 --> 41:29.144
Angry because I'd cause you pain?

41:29.145 --> 41:31.313
Or scared?
Because you know

41:31.314 --> 41:32.859
it's gonna get a lot worse?

41:39.605 --> 41:41.522
You boys want to play games?

41:43.025 --> 41:44.993
Go ahead.

41:44.994 --> 41:47.213
Let's see who breaks first.

41:47.379 --> 41:51.666
Me... or you.
