And when I see this bitch
on the street it's on.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.767
- [Dee] That bitch had my robe on.

12:09.767 --> 12:11.184
- [Nola] Come on.

12:16.360 --> 12:17.193
- Here take it.

12:17.193 --> 12:18.026
I don't want it anyway.

12:18.026 --> 12:19.976
It's too big for me.

12:19.976 --> 12:21.491
- [Dee] I'll kill this hoe.

12:21.491 --> 12:22.440
- Come on Dee.

12:22.440 --> 12:23.741
Come on Dee.

12:23.741 --> 12:26.824
Get the fuck out of here, fuck nigga.

12:30.600 --> 12:31.944
- Well Mrs. Smith.

12:31.944 --> 12:35.411
We're gonna have a job on our
hands dividing up the assets

12:35.411 --> 12:37.779
in your divorce proceedings.

12:37.779 --> 12:39.656
- Well I don't understand.

12:39.656 --> 12:41.747
Everything was in both of our names,

12:41.747 --> 12:44.747
the house, the business, everything.

12:47.773 --> 12:50.215
- Well, Ms. Smith, I went

12:50.215 --> 12:52.104
through all of the
documents that you told me

12:52.104 --> 12:56.797
to go through, and apparently
you relinquished your rights

12:56.797 --> 12:59.645
to the ownership of the business.

12:59.645 --> 13:04.145
And you also did a quick
claim deed that put your home

13:06.109 --> 13:10.653
into a business called
"Hightower Holdings LLC."

13:10.653 --> 13:14.070
Do you recall doing this over a year ago?

13:15.144 --> 13:17.766
- I mean, Walter gave me papers

13:17.766 --> 13:18.909
to sign all the time,

13:18.909 --> 13:20.326
but I don't remember seeing anything

13:20.326 --> 13:24.861
about relinquishing my
partnership to the business

13:24.861 --> 13:28.147
or signing over the deed to the house.

13:28.147 --> 13:29.651
- You didn't read all of the documents

13:29.651 --> 13:32.040
your husband had you to sign?

13:32.040 --> 13:34.856
- [Dee] I didn't think I had to.

13:34.856 --> 13:38.504
- Well apparently he's been
planning this for over a year.

13:38.504 --> 13:41.254
(dramatic music)

13:50.589 --> 13:54.013
Look Mrs. Smith, you said you caught him

13:54.013 --> 13:56.722
in the bed with another woman.

13:56.722 --> 13:57.555
- I did.

13:59.101 --> 14:01.800
- He kicked you out the house.

14:01.800 --> 14:04.466
He moved his mistress in.

14:04.466 --> 14:07.549
And he mailed your clothes to you.

14:07.549 --> 14:08.382
- Yeah.

14:10.963 --> 14:13.949
- You don't have to worry
about a retainer's fee.

14:13.949 --> 14:16.231
He'll eventually pay it.

14:16.231 --> 14:19.848
My team and I we will definitely dig deep

14:19.848 --> 14:20.818
and make sure we go

14:20.818 --> 14:24.435
through all of his assets,
even the ones he has hidden.

14:24.435 --> 14:26.791
You will get what you're deserved.

14:26.791 --> 14:28.956
I guarantee you that.

14:28.956 --> 14:32.199
I can't stand a lying, cheating man.

14:32.199 --> 14:33.866
- Thank you so much.

14:35.783 --> 14:37.746
No, no, no wait, wait, wait.

14:37.746 --> 14:38.727
What are you doing?

14:38.727 --> 14:40.135
This is my car.

14:40.135 --> 14:41.714
- Hey, wait clearly it's the banks.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.346
You done missed five payments.

14:43.346 --> 14:46.044
- Impossible, that's impossible.

14:46.044 --> 14:47.696
- I mean, you owe.

14:47.696 --> 14:48.529
I repo.

14:53.008 --> 14:56.498
(engine starts)

14:56.498 --> 14:57.581
- Hello Nola.

14:58.610 --> 15:01.575
Can you come pick me up
from the lawyer's office?

15:01.575 --> 15:02.408
Well yeah.

15:03.279 --> 15:06.866
Apparently my car just got repoed.

15:06.866 --> 15:07.699
Okay.

15:08.658 --> 15:10.491
How do I work an uber?

15:15.888 --> 15:18.221
(dog barks)

15:20.220 --> 15:21.669
Man remember back in high school we used

15:21.669 --> 15:22.631
to fuck with them east coast

15:22.631 --> 15:25.048
jack boys, Tommy and Sincere?

15:26.642 --> 15:28.658
- How can I forget?

15:28.658 --> 15:31.463
They had us setting up
old white men tourists

15:31.463 --> 15:34.290
on South Beach chasing some hot ass.

15:34.290 --> 15:37.116
- Man whatever happened to them?

15:37.116 --> 15:39.666
- Last time I checked Sincere got killed.

15:39.666 --> 15:43.121
And Tommy, ain't nobody
heard from him since.

15:43.121 --> 15:45.038
- Man that's fucked up.

15:47.002 --> 15:48.784
But we grew up.

15:48.784 --> 15:53.784
I went to college, met the
man of my dreams got married.

15:53.798 --> 15:57.298
I been living a real good life since then.

15:58.151 --> 15:59.751
- Till now.

15:59.751 --> 16:01.584
- Right, up until now.

16:04.306 --> 16:07.708
Man my husband keeps a lot of money

16:07.708 --> 16:10.503
in that safe downtown in his office.

16:10.503 --> 16:12.572
- Oh yeah, what's a lot of money?

16:12.572 --> 16:13.489
- Like 50K.

16:14.514 --> 16:16.645
Yeah he kept it for emergencies, just

16:16.645 --> 16:18.066
in case something happened.

16:18.066 --> 16:22.566
- A $50,000 emergency cash
fund, what are y'all doing?

16:23.420 --> 16:25.170
- Shit I'm broke now.

16:26.258 --> 16:28.530
Car repossessed, and I need some money

16:28.530 --> 16:31.447
to hold me over for a little while.

16:32.850 --> 16:34.503
- That's fucked up.

16:34.503 --> 16:35.570
So you thinking about running up in there

16:35.570 --> 16:37.767
and go get some cash?

16:37.767 --> 16:38.650
- Shit we used to do it back

16:38.650 --> 16:40.583
in the day with them old white men.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.332
Why we can't do it now?

16:42.332 --> 16:46.140
I mean, it's a 24 hour security
guard that carries a club,

16:46.140 --> 16:48.987
a cleaning crew that's there every night.

16:48.987 --> 16:52.007
Walter works late on Wednesdays.

16:52.007 --> 16:55.004
We need to go in there on Wednesday night.

16:55.004 --> 16:57.702
He the only one that got the
combination to the safe though.

16:57.702 --> 17:00.156
- [Nola] But are you
sure you wanna do this?

17:00.156 --> 17:02.962
- [Dee] Yeah I'm sure I wanna do this.

17:02.962 --> 17:04.487
- [Nola] And besides
my little sister could

17:04.487 --> 17:06.951
sure use the extra cash.

17:06.951 --> 17:07.784
- Crystal.

17:08.818 --> 17:10.694
Ain't she real spiritual?

17:10.694 --> 17:13.468
You sure she gonna be down
for doing something like this?

17:13.468 --> 17:14.300
- Oh yeah.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.082
When you got an extra mouth to feed

17:16.082 --> 17:17.255
and your baby daddy ain't no where

17:17.255 --> 17:20.786
to be found, you gotta
do what you gotta do.

17:20.786 --> 17:23.122
And besides it's hard
to find jobs out here.

17:23.122 --> 17:25.874
Why you think my ass in
the strip club every night?

17:25.874 --> 17:28.145
- 'Cause you a hoe.

17:28.145 --> 17:29.586
- If I was a hoe, I wouldn't be trying

17:29.586 --> 17:32.039
to do this shit with your ass.

17:32.039 --> 17:35.324
But besides this money
could put me back in school.

17:35.324 --> 17:39.741
- You know what my cousin
Daisy she a real bad bitch.

17:40.828 --> 17:42.023
We need to call her.

17:42.023 --> 17:44.368
She always down to hit a lick.

17:44.368 --> 17:47.506
- Daisy, that crazy bitch Daisy?

17:47.506 --> 17:51.250
- Ever since we was little
Daisy was the baddest bitch.

17:51.250 --> 17:52.647
- So we splitting four ways?

17:52.647 --> 17:54.599
- [Dee] We splitting four ways.

17:54.599 --> 17:55.766
- Let's do it.

17:59.570 --> 18:00.828
- All right, so I got us the same

18:00.828 --> 18:04.071
uniforms that the cleaning
crew wear in the building

18:04.071 --> 18:06.951
so we can blend in with the scenery.

18:06.951 --> 18:10.204
- So how we still supposed to get in?

18:10.204 --> 18:12.338
- I mean I still got my
keys to the building.

18:12.338 --> 18:15.623
But Walter probably
changed his locks by now.

18:15.623 --> 18:17.777
But he can't change the
locks to the building.

18:17.777 --> 18:19.794
So we can go in through the back.

18:19.794 --> 18:22.172
- But if the office locked,
how the fuck we gonna get in?

18:22.172 --> 18:24.348
- Now that's when shit get tricky.

18:24.348 --> 18:27.142
They got a security guard
that got a master key.

18:27.142 --> 18:30.439
That key open up every
office in the building.

18:30.439 --> 18:32.935
If we get that key from
him, we in the office

18:32.935 --> 18:34.602
and we at that safe.

18:38.076 --> 18:39.527
- Where'd you get that gun?

18:39.527 --> 18:41.191
- Relax sis.

18:41.191 --> 18:43.047
It's my pistol.

18:43.047 --> 18:45.191
- But why do you have a gun?

18:45.191 --> 18:46.855
- I'm a stripper.

18:46.855 --> 18:48.348
I mean, you know niggas be acting crazy

18:48.348 --> 18:51.324
after the club, wanna be
stalking bitches and shit.

18:51.324 --> 18:53.820
So I gotta stay strapped.

18:53.820 --> 18:55.410
- I don't think I can do this.

18:55.410 --> 18:56.519
You said this was gonna be easy.

18:56.519 --> 18:58.695
You didn't say nothing
about somebody getting hurt.

18:58.695 --> 19:00.359
- Nobody's getting hurt.

19:00.359 --> 19:01.874
It's just for convincing.

19:01.874 --> 19:02.972
- Convincing?

19:02.972 --> 19:04.327
What does that even mean?

19:04.327 --> 19:08.210
- Look I ain't a dancer,
but I'm a gangster.

19:08.210 --> 19:10.215
But you know I stay with my shit on me.

19:10.215 --> 19:11.740
- Nope, nope.

19:11.740 --> 19:12.764
I can't do this.

19:12.764 --> 19:14.354
Y'all got too many guns on the table,

19:14.354 --> 19:15.258
and I don't like guns,

19:15.258 --> 19:18.023
and I want nothing to do with them.

19:18.023 --> 19:19.356
- Crystal relax.

19:20.519 --> 19:24.186
I mean, this is $12,500
a piece on the line.

19:25.938 --> 19:26.823
And all we gotta do is worry

19:26.823 --> 19:29.424
about some fucking fat ass security guard,

19:29.424 --> 19:31.708
and we're doing all the heavy lifting.

19:31.708 --> 19:33.855
All you gotta do is watch out.

19:33.855 --> 19:36.624
And I know your baby needs
some new clothes right now.

19:36.624 --> 19:39.388
Yeah it's a struggle to keep
food in your refrigerator

19:39.388 --> 19:41.541
and keep a roof over your head.

19:41.541 --> 19:42.898
So sit the fuck down,

19:42.898 --> 19:45.231
and stop acting like a baby.

19:55.559 --> 19:58.142
(upbeat music)

20:04.850 --> 20:07.350
(man screams)

20:08.210 --> 20:10.439
- [Dee] Place that motherfucker up here.

20:10.439 --> 20:13.022
(upbeat music)

20:24.967 --> 20:26.972
- Fuck this shit.

20:26.972 --> 20:28.222
- Wait, no gun.

20:32.262 --> 20:34.940
- [Daisy] Get this fat
motherfucker off me.

20:34.940 --> 20:35.773
Bitch.

20:36.751 --> 20:39.334
(upbeat music)

20:53.851 --> 20:57.116
- Look from here on out, we wear our mask.

20:57.116 --> 20:59.292
We cannot risk Walter seeing our faces.

20:59.292 --> 21:01.511
- What the fuck you think
this is, "Set it Off" Part II?

21:01.511 --> 21:03.527
- Bitch this ain't no motherfucking movie.

21:03.527 --> 21:05.778
You trying to get to this bag or not?

21:05.778 --> 21:07.206
- Let's get the bag.

21:07.206 --> 21:09.789
(upbeat music)

22:21.703 --> 22:23.836
- Hey what's up baby?

22:23.836 --> 22:25.820
Yeah I'm just finishing
up here at the office.

22:25.820 --> 22:27.612
Hey I was thinking Chinese tonight.

22:27.612 --> 22:30.029
What do you think about that?

22:35.634 --> 22:36.690
Chinese it is.

22:36.690 --> 22:38.373
Hey do me a favor, give 'em a call,

22:38.373 --> 22:40.442
and let 'em know I'll
be about 10, 15 minutes,

22:40.442 --> 22:43.111
and I'll come pick it up.

22:43.111 --> 22:45.031
All right, can't wait to see you.

22:45.031 --> 22:46.198
Love you, bye.

23:19.972 --> 23:20.805
(woman screams)

23:20.805 --> 23:22.661
What the fuck?

23:22.661 --> 23:23.494
- [Dee] Go, go.

23:23.494 --> 23:25.114
- What the hell is this about?

23:25.114 --> 23:27.429
- Open the door.
- Open the door.

23:27.429 --> 23:29.711
- [Dee] Get the fuck in there right now.

23:29.711 --> 23:31.258
- What is this about?

23:31.258 --> 23:32.771
All right, hold on, okay.

23:32.771 --> 23:34.103
All right, all right.

23:34.103 --> 23:36.623
Look, I have $300 in my wallet.

23:36.623 --> 23:39.930
I have a watch, right,
and I have a cell phone.

23:39.930 --> 23:43.055
Just take it, take it
all and leave please.

23:43.055 --> 23:44.783
What is going on?

23:44.783 --> 23:45.616
- [Nola] We didn't come here

23:45.616 --> 23:47.396
for no damn watch or a cellphone.

23:47.396 --> 23:49.423
Where the safe at?

23:49.423 --> 23:51.119
- Safe, what safe?

23:51.119 --> 23:54.586
This is my office, my first floor office.

23:54.586 --> 23:56.669
- This safe motherfucker.

23:57.817 --> 23:59.290
- [Walter] There's nothing in there.

23:59.290 --> 24:04.090
Whoever gave you your
information mislead you clearly.

24:04.090 --> 24:06.925
You know I never trust you
fucking cleaning ladies.

24:06.925 --> 24:08.473
All of y'all look like convicts.

24:08.473 --> 24:09.306
- [Daisy] Man shut the fuck up.

24:09.306 --> 24:10.415
We ain't got no time for that shit.

24:10.415 --> 24:11.823
Where's the fucking key?

24:11.823 --> 24:13.487
- [Walter] I don't have a key.

24:13.487 --> 24:14.938
- [Crystal] Look y'all, come on let's go.

24:14.938 --> 24:16.730
He said there's nothing
in there, so let's roll.

24:16.730 --> 24:18.042
- [Dee] Man fuck that.

24:18.042 --> 24:19.641
Hold that motherfucker down.

24:19.641 --> 24:20.974
- [Walter] Wait.

24:22.115 --> 24:23.717
- Where the fuck is the key?
- What are you doing?

24:23.717 --> 24:24.869
Hold on.

24:24.869 --> 24:25.702
What key?

24:25.702 --> 24:26.853
I don't have a key.

24:26.853 --> 24:28.751
- [Daisy] Oh yeah, he gonna talk now.

24:28.751 --> 24:31.002
- [Dee] I said where the fuck is the key.

24:31.002 --> 24:32.525
- All right, all right, okay.

24:32.525 --> 24:34.858
It's right here, right here.

24:35.759 --> 24:36.965
Key.

24:36.965 --> 24:38.157
- Hold him.
- I'm sorry.

24:38.157 --> 24:42.907
- [Dee] And if that motherfucker
move, burn his dick off.

24:56.325 --> 24:59.258
- [Nola] Come on, we gotta go now.

24:59.258 --> 25:00.091
- All right, take it.
- Not without this Roley.

25:00.091 --> 25:01.466
- Take it.

25:01.466 --> 25:04.966
- [Daisy] Shit, put your hands down nigga.

25:08.997 --> 25:11.258
- [Dee] Give me that.

25:11.258 --> 25:12.878
- What, wait, hold on.

25:12.878 --> 25:13.839
(Walter screams)

25:13.839 --> 25:15.171
Hold on.

25:15.171 --> 25:16.399
- Let's go.

25:16.399 --> 25:18.982
(upbeat music)

25:54.778 --> 25:58.020
All right ladies, don't
spend it all in one spot.

25:58.020 --> 26:00.815
- I'm a get rid of these jumpsuits.

26:00.815 --> 26:02.479
- We probably should just burn 'em.

26:02.479 --> 26:04.666
- No, I'm taking these back to Carol.

26:04.666 --> 26:06.552
I'm gonna put 'em in the dumpster.

26:06.552 --> 26:08.666
Four bums gonna be wearing
these bitches tomorrow.

26:08.666 --> 26:10.874
(women laugh)

26:10.874 --> 26:13.549
- Hey y'all my shoulder is aching.

26:13.549 --> 26:15.044
I'm about to go soak in the tub.

26:15.044 --> 26:16.677
Holler at y'all bitches tomorrow.

26:16.677 --> 26:18.522
- All right sis.
- All right remember.

26:18.522 --> 26:20.522
Speak of this to no one.

26:21.667 --> 26:22.667
- All right.

26:25.647 --> 26:28.230
(upbeat music)

26:34.447 --> 26:35.781
- So what you think about the place?

26:35.781 --> 26:37.178
- I love it.

26:37.178 --> 26:39.898
I knew you'd pick up on
my taste sooner or later.

26:39.898 --> 26:40.731
- I'm pretty sure I can pick up

26:40.731 --> 26:43.077
on a few things if you'd let me.

26:43.077 --> 26:46.405
However when you're ready
to put this offer in.

26:46.405 --> 26:47.238
- Hold on now.

26:47.238 --> 26:48.071
Slow down.

26:48.071 --> 26:51.034
You're moving a little too fast.

26:51.034 --> 26:53.061
- I mean they got everything you want,

26:53.061 --> 26:55.855
700 square feet, looking
at this beautiful view,

26:55.855 --> 26:57.658
one bedroom, one bath.

26:57.658 --> 26:59.759
This look like something you used to.

26:59.759 --> 27:02.063
Where you stay at now?

27:02.063 --> 27:03.063
- Well my...

27:05.413 --> 27:07.279
I'm looking for bigger and better.

27:07.279 --> 27:08.901
I just got a new business opportunity.

27:08.901 --> 27:11.234
So I'm just looking for new.

27:12.846 --> 27:14.095
- Well you know what they say when

27:14.095 --> 27:15.973
it comes to opportunity.

27:15.973 --> 27:17.667
You better let it through the front door.

27:17.667 --> 27:21.434
- Or you can bust that motherfucker
through the back window.

27:21.434 --> 27:23.258
(Dee and man laugh)

27:23.258 --> 27:24.258
- You crazy.

27:25.550 --> 27:28.218
- You know what I want it.

27:28.218 --> 27:30.021
And I'm not financing.

27:30.021 --> 27:31.597
I'm paying in all cash.

27:31.597 --> 27:33.597
- Oh your bag like that?

27:46.562 --> 27:48.815
- What y'all looking at?

27:48.815 --> 27:49.732
Dumb asses.

27:52.122 --> 27:54.213
- All right class dismissed.

27:54.213 --> 27:56.367
I'll see y'all tomorrow.

27:56.367 --> 27:58.367
I'll see y'all tomorrow.

28:01.637 --> 28:04.554
(faintly speaking)

28:09.784 --> 28:12.090
Ms. Gray can I talk to you for a minute?

28:12.090 --> 28:14.650
- [Nola] Yeah, what's the problem?

28:14.650 --> 28:17.221
- Who said it was a problem?

28:17.221 --> 28:18.810
- [Nola] Those two.

28:18.810 --> 28:20.378
- Listen don't worry about them, okay,

28:20.378 --> 28:22.436
'cause they a bunch of jackasses.

28:22.436 --> 28:25.701
Just wanted to make sure if
you need any extra class help

28:25.701 --> 28:29.807
or after class tutoring
I'm available to you.

28:29.807 --> 28:32.910
- To be honest, I haven't
been to school in a while,

28:32.910 --> 28:36.613
and these classes are a
lot harder than I expected.

28:36.613 --> 28:38.788
So Professor Jackson I might just have

28:38.788 --> 28:41.669
to take you up on that extra tutoring.

28:41.669 --> 28:42.903
- All right thank you.

28:42.903 --> 28:44.484
I like that.

28:44.484 --> 28:45.317
- So is there a link

28:45.317 --> 28:48.517
on the website where I can sign up for?

28:48.517 --> 28:50.062
- Actually I was thinking
that we don't really have

28:50.062 --> 28:51.930
to go through the school to do it.

28:51.930 --> 28:52.824
See what I'm offering you is

28:52.824 --> 28:56.335
private tutoring, more one-on-one.

28:56.335 --> 28:58.063
See I wanna make sure
you get all my lessons

28:58.063 --> 29:00.230
in a more slowed-down pace

29:01.509 --> 29:04.088
and more of a relaxed setting.

29:04.088 --> 29:06.201
- Right, well it sounds good.

29:06.201 --> 29:07.247
- All right.

29:07.247 --> 29:09.626
So listen hey, take my card

29:09.626 --> 29:13.029
and thinking maybe some time next week.

29:13.029 --> 29:15.396
We can go ahead and get
those classes started.

29:15.396 --> 29:16.910
- Maybe.

29:16.910 --> 29:18.117
- See you then.
- Bye.

29:18.117 --> 29:19.867
- All right, bye bye.

29:40.442 --> 29:42.181
- You heard from that lawyer lately.

29:42.181 --> 29:43.014
Last time I talked

29:43.014 --> 29:46.607
to her she was still going
through Walter's finances.

29:46.607 --> 29:50.607
He is doing a good ass
job of hiding his assets.

29:51.717 --> 29:54.351
How's school been going?

29:54.351 --> 29:56.005
- You know I've been grinding through it.

29:56.005 --> 29:58.053
I've been actually getting
some extra tutoring

29:58.053 --> 29:59.790
from this one professor.

29:59.790 --> 30:01.829
And it's been a slow process,

30:01.829 --> 30:03.236
but I'm starting to catch up.

30:03.236 --> 30:04.153
- Tutoring.

30:06.010 --> 30:07.482
What he look like?

30:07.482 --> 30:09.775
- Girl, he is so fine,

30:09.775 --> 30:12.358
tall, handsome, smart, my type.

30:13.957 --> 30:15.791
- Okay, okay I see you.

30:15.791 --> 30:19.813
Going for the professional
type nowadays, okay.

30:19.813 --> 30:22.062
- But no really, he's
actually really helping

30:22.062 --> 30:23.599
me with extra tutoring.

30:23.599 --> 30:25.592
We meet up at the coffee shop.

30:25.592 --> 30:27.653
And we also met up at the park one time.

30:27.653 --> 30:29.743
And girl he had these
gray sweat shorts on,

30:29.743 --> 30:32.576
and I was like the print was real.

30:33.551 --> 30:34.551
- Okay, and.

30:35.493 --> 30:38.373
- Listen he was once
reading me my assignment

30:38.373 --> 30:39.725
up on that bench.

30:39.725 --> 30:44.687
He opened up his legs, placed
his elbows on his knees.

30:44.687 --> 30:46.597
- [Dee] And then what?

30:46.597 --> 30:49.594
- Shifted over to the left
and his whole dick fell out.

30:49.594 --> 30:52.751
- Bitch, his whole dick fell out.

30:52.751 --> 30:54.501
- Whole fucking dick.

30:54.501 --> 30:56.058
- And you ain't tell him?

30:56.058 --> 31:00.269
- Girl no, that thing was
looking fucking thick and juicy.

31:00.269 --> 31:03.352
- So what did he say when you saw it?

31:04.303 --> 31:07.780
- Excuse me Ms. Drake I didn't
mean for that to happen.

31:07.780 --> 31:12.346
But girls my eyes seen what
it saw and fuck the books.

31:12.346 --> 31:13.846
- Nola you a mess.

31:14.767 --> 31:16.612
- So how you liking your new place?

31:16.612 --> 31:17.733
- I like it.

31:17.733 --> 31:19.663
I love it actually.

31:19.663 --> 31:22.789
Girl the real estate agent
who helped me find it was fine

31:22.789 --> 31:27.109
as hell, and I'm going
on a date with him later.

31:27.109 --> 31:29.391
- So you looking at new jobs?

31:29.391 --> 31:32.515
- Like you said before,
ain't no damn jobs out here.

31:32.515 --> 31:34.383
I got a whole bachelor's degree,

31:34.383 --> 31:36.389
and the best that I can find right now is

31:36.389 --> 31:40.139
a temporary assistant
job, being a secretary.

31:41.274 --> 31:43.685
- I mean, girl, you can
always get your dance license

31:43.685 --> 31:45.221
and come shake that ass with me.

31:45.221 --> 31:46.853
I mean, you thick enough.

31:46.853 --> 31:49.914
- I ain't ready for all that yet.

31:49.914 --> 31:53.785
How you still doing money-wise

31:56.143 --> 31:58.362
and paying bills, what money?

31:58.362 --> 31:59.919

Pop bottles, pop pussy, you understand me?

34:44.889 --> 34:47.071
- I'm sorry, I only put two.

34:47.071 --> 34:48.431
Do you want me to get you another cup

34:48.431 --> 34:50.522
or would you like me to
bring you some more sugar?

34:50.522 --> 34:51.855
- How about the file that I asked you

34:51.855 --> 34:53.551
to put into the database yesterday?

34:53.551 --> 34:54.424
I'm looking for it.

34:54.424 --> 34:55.407
I don't even see it.

34:55.407 --> 34:58.394
- I put it in under the
Redman's brother's file.

34:58.394 --> 35:02.157
- First it should be under the
Redman construction folder,

35:02.157 --> 35:04.282
not the Redman brother's file.

35:04.282 --> 35:07.747
And second, I don't even
see it in the wrong folder.

35:07.747 --> 35:09.509
Did you even do what I asked you to do?

35:09.509 --> 35:12.632
- I'm sure I put it in there.

35:12.632 --> 35:13.914
- How 'bout this?

35:13.914 --> 35:18.106
Just go back to your little
desk, find it, email it to me,

35:18.106 --> 35:20.410
and I'll take care of it from here.

35:20.410 --> 35:22.327
- Okay, we'll do.

35:30.946 --> 35:34.287

35:34.287 --> 35:36.787

35:48.569 --> 35:51.236

35:59.077 --> 36:02.327
- [Temp Boss] Where the fuck she going?

36:04.378 --> 36:06.735
- Listen, so y'all know this Saturday is

36:09.039 --> 36:11.823
- [Daisy] I like his shit, and...

36:11.823 --> 36:16.240
- And the bar makes about
150,000 or more that night.

36:17.123 --> 36:20.101
- Okay, so what does
that have to do with us?

36:20.101 --> 36:22.266
- So how much money do you got left

36:22.266 --> 36:25.317
after that Walter situation?

36:25.317 --> 36:26.746
- None.

36:26.746 --> 36:29.477
- I mean, my bills is paid up for a while,

36:29.477 --> 36:32.623
and once I get a decent
job I'll be all right.

36:32.623 --> 36:35.066
- So don't you think if you
hit a big lick like this

36:35.066 --> 36:36.634
your bills a be paid up

36:36.634 --> 36:37.467
and you wouldn't have to worry

36:37.467 --> 36:41.786
about anything, possibly
invest or something?

36:41.786 --> 36:43.471
What you think?

36:43.471 --> 36:46.885
- Shit, I think that sounds good.

36:46.885 --> 36:48.666
- [Daisy] Me too.

36:48.666 --> 36:49.754
- Exactly.

36:49.754 --> 36:51.337
We can rob the bar.

36:52.226 --> 36:54.810
- I think we taking this
a little too far now.

36:54.810 --> 36:57.103
I mean, Walter was a bad person,

36:57.103 --> 36:59.045
and we got away the first time.

36:59.045 --> 37:03.790
But now y'all wanna rob a
bar, a business establishment?

37:03.790 --> 37:04.719
I don't know about that.

37:04.719 --> 37:05.893
I don't think I want that kinda karma

37:05.893 --> 37:07.557
on me and my baby.

37:07.557 --> 37:10.474
I might not be able to do this one.

37:11.333 --> 37:13.903
- So you think Vinny is a good person.

37:13.903 --> 37:17.285
He has harassed every woman
in that bar, pressuring them

37:17.285 --> 37:19.429
to have sex with him.

37:19.429 --> 37:22.810
And he's even harassed me
on countless occasions.

37:22.810 --> 37:24.517
- Wait, wait are you serious?

37:24.517 --> 37:26.106
So did he hurt you sis?

37:26.106 --> 37:27.689
- No, but he tried.

37:28.709 --> 37:31.043
Fuck Vinny and that bar.

37:31.043 --> 37:32.856
Let's get that bag.

37:32.856 --> 37:36.442
I know his whole routine
and the layout of that bar.

37:36.442 --> 37:39.192
- Shit, for a 150 grand I'm down.

37:41.093 --> 37:42.959
- And you know I don't
need much convincing.

37:42.959 --> 37:44.293
I'm in.

37:44.293 --> 37:45.967
- [Dee] Crystal?

37:45.967 --> 37:47.973
- I mean, he tried to hurt my sister.

37:47.973 --> 37:52.526
And he's made other women
sell their bodies, so I'm in.

37:52.526 --> 37:54.670
- Hey, I like what you called us

37:54.670 --> 37:58.170
in the group text, "the bag girls."

37:58.170 --> 38:00.698
- Yeah The Bag Girls, that's dope.

38:00.698 --> 38:01.818
- It's nice.

38:01.818 --> 38:05.295
- Yeah, The Bag Girls, but listen ladies.

38:05.295 --> 38:06.885
We gotta come up with a couple code names

38:06.885 --> 38:08.389
before we go in that building.

38:08.389 --> 38:11.736
Y'all cannot make a
mistake and call me "Nola"

38:11.736 --> 38:13.231
or my ass is dead.

38:13.231 --> 38:14.725
- Look I know what we can do.

38:14.725 --> 38:18.543
We can call each other code
names like colors, like

38:18.543 --> 38:22.125
Ms. Pink, Ms. Yellow, like
they did in "Reservoir Dogs,"

38:22.125 --> 38:23.823
the Quentin Tarantino movie.

38:23.823 --> 38:25.906
- Fuck Quentin Tarantino.

38:26.914 --> 38:28.408
- You know what I got it.

38:28.408 --> 38:30.831
We call ourselves the Bag Girls right.

38:30.831 --> 38:34.629
Why don't we just name
ourselves after designer bags?

38:34.629 --> 38:35.514
- All right.

38:35.514 --> 38:36.911
- I like that idea.

38:36.911 --> 38:39.556
- Well y'all can call me "Ms. Gucci."

38:39.556 --> 38:41.223
- Yeah that figures.

38:42.957 --> 38:47.237
- Well if you Ms. Gucci,
I'm definitely Ms. Louie.

38:47.237 --> 38:48.143
- I could see that.

38:48.143 --> 38:48.976
I could see that.

38:48.976 --> 38:51.301
- Okay, okay, okay, it's my turn.

38:51.301 --> 38:52.468
I'm Ms. Fendi.

38:53.549 --> 38:55.490
- All right now Ms. Fendi bag.

38:55.490 --> 38:56.973
I see you, girl.

38:56.973 --> 38:57.903
- Hold up.

38:57.903 --> 39:01.112
All you bitches got top designer names.

39:01.112 --> 39:03.695
What I'm supposed to be called?

39:03.695 --> 39:06.479
- Hold on cuz, I got the
perfect name for you.

39:06.479 --> 39:11.479
See, the name that match your
personality is Ms. Coach.

39:11.759 --> 39:13.762
(women laugh)

39:13.762 --> 39:16.239
You know you love a good coach bag.

39:16.239 --> 39:19.109
- Look y'all think y'all funny.

39:19.109 --> 39:23.279
I fucks with coach, and I got
a coach bag on me right now.

39:23.279 --> 39:25.229
- Man I'm just gassing you cuz.

39:25.229 --> 39:29.562
I got the perfect name
for you, Ms. Chanel.

39:29.562 --> 39:30.575
- Okay I could see that.

39:30.575 --> 39:31.759
I like that.

39:31.759 --> 39:33.466
Shit but on the real though, we gotta grab

39:33.466 --> 39:35.461
some more of those cleaner jumpsuits.

39:35.461 --> 39:37.327
I been got rid of the old ones.

39:37.327 --> 39:41.071
- No, I'll get us some fly
ass shit that'll spook Vinny

39:41.071 --> 39:43.119
and those bouncers too.

39:43.119 --> 39:46.874
- Bouncers, wait what
we gonna do about them?

39:46.874 --> 39:48.442
Do they carry guns?

39:48.442 --> 39:49.690
- From what my boy Reggie told me,

39:49.690 --> 39:51.941
the bartender, is that
they keep a 12 gauge

39:51.941 --> 39:54.106
in Vinny's office to walk him to the car.

39:54.106 --> 39:58.010
But other than that there's
no guns allowed in that club.

39:58.010 --> 40:00.037
- [Daisy] Bouncers too?

40:00.037 --> 40:01.614
- Bouncers too.

40:01.614 --> 40:04.335
- How many bouncers we talking about here?

40:04.335 --> 40:06.351
- So if we strike at the
right time, we're only dealing

40:06.351 --> 40:08.111
with four bouncers, and on my way

40:08.111 --> 40:12.623
out I could unlock that
emergency dancer door upstairs.

40:12.623 --> 40:13.828
- [Daisy] We might need
a little more steel

40:13.828 --> 40:15.621
to get everybody to cooperate.

40:15.621 --> 40:18.840
Two pistols ain't gonna
get the job done this time.

40:18.840 --> 40:19.813
- Right.

40:19.813 --> 40:23.077
And I got the right
person to call for that.

40:23.077 --> 40:25.827
(soothing music)

40:33.343 --> 40:34.522
- Hey man where your people at,

40:34.522 --> 40:37.253
'cause these niggas looking real serious?

40:37.253 --> 40:38.670
- Relax, we good.

40:40.378 --> 40:41.669
- Bro I see you staring all hard.

40:41.669 --> 40:42.658
I just wanna let you know you ain't

40:42.658 --> 40:46.082
the only one strapped in this bitch.

40:46.082 --> 40:47.618
Oh you think I'm fucking playing.

40:47.618 --> 40:49.677
- Jesus save us.

40:49.677 --> 40:53.368
- No ain't no white
Jesus coming to save you.

40:53.368 --> 40:54.951
- Jake is that you?

40:57.121 --> 40:59.128
- At ease man, at ease.

40:59.128 --> 41:01.878
(soothing music)

41:07.170 --> 41:08.450
(faintly speaking)

41:08.450 --> 41:10.061
- Scared as fuck.

41:10.061 --> 41:12.181
Your goons had us shook out here.

41:12.181 --> 41:13.931
- Ain't nobody shook.

41:15.320 --> 41:18.103
- You gonna come here and give me a hug

41:18.103 --> 41:20.770
damn, you acting like that girl.

41:23.085 --> 41:25.270
Introduce me to your girls.

41:25.270 --> 41:26.687
- So this is Dee.

41:27.703 --> 41:29.869
I mean, this is Ms. Gucci.

41:29.869 --> 41:31.160
This is Ms. Fendi.

41:31.160 --> 41:33.932
And that little hot head
over there, Ms. Chanel.

41:33.932 --> 41:35.650
- Okay, that's what's up.

41:35.650 --> 41:37.687
Well I go by the name of Jake, all right.

41:37.687 --> 41:39.565
I'll be the middle name to y'all

41:39.565 --> 41:42.776
and any street shit that
y'all might need, you dig?

41:42.776 --> 41:45.208
I heard y'all looking for some heat.

41:45.208 --> 41:46.041
- Right.

41:47.880 --> 41:51.392
- Can you explain to us
what each one of these do?

41:51.392 --> 41:53.036
- Of course I can.

41:53.036 --> 41:56.619
Now this right here is
some nice little 45,

41:58.018 --> 42:01.351
you dig, standard weapon, nothing crazy.

42:03.309 --> 42:05.976
But now you got the AK-47.

42:05.976 --> 42:07.928
Now this baby originated in Russia, used

42:07.928 --> 42:09.570
by the Soviet Union.

42:09.570 --> 42:12.909
Then adopted by your average
American gang banger, used

42:12.909 --> 42:17.336
for shootouts, drive-by's,
simple shit like that.

42:17.336 --> 42:18.828
But I guarantee you it'll put a hole

42:18.828 --> 42:21.245
in a motherfucker real quick.

42:25.378 --> 42:29.295
AR-15, America's most
beloved and hated weapon.

42:31.756 --> 42:33.868
Now this thing has been
used all over the world

42:33.868 --> 42:35.554
to invade other countries and create war

42:35.554 --> 42:37.538
and shit like that.

42:37.538 --> 42:39.768
Then adopted by your
average American white boy

42:39.768 --> 42:40.621
who felt some type of way

42:40.621 --> 42:44.237
because their supervisor
passed them up for promotion.

42:44.237 --> 42:45.421
Mowing down on cheerleaders

42:45.421 --> 42:47.394
and shit like that for
calling him a fat geek back

42:47.394 --> 42:49.227
in 11th grade biology.

42:51.522 --> 42:55.022
This baby, double barrel 12-gauge shotgun.

42:58.605 --> 43:01.409
Now it's the cheapest of the group,

43:01.409 --> 43:04.269
but it's the most reliable.

43:04.269 --> 43:05.762
- That bitch look old as a motherfucker,

43:05.762 --> 43:08.269
but if it's cheap and
it's the most reliable,

43:08.269 --> 43:11.053
we gonna take that for sure.

43:11.053 --> 43:14.636
- And it won't jam on
you, easy to conceal.

43:15.810 --> 43:19.310
Plus you got multiple ammo options for it.

43:21.752 --> 43:24.919
Personally, I like the buckshot slugs.

43:25.762 --> 43:27.929
- What are buckshot slugs?

43:28.823 --> 43:30.817
- Well the buckshot slug is
when you put the buckshot

43:30.817 --> 43:32.568
in the first pipe, clear the area

43:32.568 --> 43:35.436
out, put the slug in the second pipe

43:35.436 --> 43:37.314
to put a hole in a nigga ass

43:37.314 --> 43:40.459
if he don't comply,
guaranteeing that the next

43:40.459 --> 43:43.292
nigga won't make the same mistake.

43:44.205 --> 43:46.293
- So how much you gonna
charge for all this?

43:46.293 --> 43:48.098
- [Jake] Shit you want ammo with it too?

43:48.098 --> 43:49.098
- Hell yeah.

43:50.443 --> 43:54.610
- Normally I charge 2,500,
but for you 21 is cool.

43:57.783 --> 44:01.283
And I throw in some ammo for you for free.

44:02.146 --> 44:03.714
- Sounds like a deal to me.

44:03.714 --> 44:04.834
- All right bet.

44:04.834 --> 44:06.200
Let's rack it up.

44:06.200 --> 44:07.405
We can go in the back,
and I can show you how

44:07.405 --> 44:08.909
to use this shit.

44:08.909 --> 44:09.742
Cool?

44:09.742 --> 44:12.013
- Cool.
- All right, let's do it.

44:12.013 --> 44:14.763
(soothing music)

44:18.475 --> 44:21.142
(hip hop music)

45:03.533 --> 45:05.282
- Damn baby, you wanna get a hotel room

45:05.282 --> 45:07.618
or something, do something later tonight?

45:07.618 --> 45:09.218
- Yeah I'm have to hit the ATM though--

45:09.218 --> 45:10.733
- That's fine with me.

45:10.733 --> 45:12.233
You spending well.

45:13.174 --> 45:15.841
(hip hop music)

45:29.474 --> 45:32.141
Damn daddy why you stop tipping?

45:35.938 --> 45:37.271
- What the fuck?

45:40.364 --> 45:41.864
This is fucked up.

45:43.789 --> 45:45.314
- Why the fuck is the music still playing?

45:45.314 --> 45:46.774
Why's the stripper still in there man?

45:46.774 --> 45:48.802
- I think he out there trying
to bang something boss.

45:48.802 --> 45:49.857
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah I used

45:49.857 --> 45:52.077
to be like that too, man, trying to fuck.

45:52.077 --> 45:53.410
But hey man, get them up outta here.

45:53.410 --> 45:55.000
Man we gotta get this bag up outta here.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.770
Bank get this deposit.

45:56.770 --> 45:58.904
- Let's go baby.
- You got me.

45:58.904 --> 45:59.737
- Come on.

46:00.642 --> 46:02.642
- Take the rest of that.

46:06.123 --> 46:07.290
Oh shit shoot.

46:12.898 --> 46:15.288
(gun fires)

46:15.288 --> 46:17.633
(women scream)

46:17.633 --> 46:20.050
(shots fire)

46:21.857 --> 46:24.274
(shots fire)

46:28.706 --> 46:30.358
- [Crystal] Oh we gonna die.

46:30.358 --> 46:31.478
- [Nola] Calm the fuck down.

46:31.478 --> 46:32.781
Ms. Fendi shut up.

46:32.781 --> 46:33.614
- [Crystal] That's not my name.

46:33.614 --> 46:34.594
Don't call me that.

46:34.594 --> 46:36.429
- [Nola] Vinny just ran out
the back door with the money.

46:36.429 --> 46:38.402
Go pull the car right now to the garage.

46:38.402 --> 46:41.152
Go get the fucking car right now.

46:42.797 --> 46:45.047
Go get the car now.
- Okay.

46:46.802 --> 46:49.135
(gun fires)

46:53.314 --> 46:56.314
(suspenseful music)

46:57.720 --> 47:00.053
(gun fires)

47:01.974 --> 47:03.053
- [Nola] Get the fuck down.

47:03.053 --> 47:03.886
Give me the bag.

47:03.886 --> 47:05.136
- [Crystal] No.

47:09.227 --> 47:10.808
Motherfucker.

47:10.808 --> 47:14.308
(ominous, dramatic music)

47:22.413 --> 47:23.618
What the fuck?

47:23.618 --> 47:25.325
- Fucking right, that shit
was livest shit I seen

47:25.325 --> 47:27.149
in my fucking life.

47:27.149 --> 47:28.856
Bag Girls, who want it?

47:28.856 --> 47:29.689
Who next?

47:30.859 --> 47:32.013
- I need a drink.

47:32.013 --> 47:33.112
Who want one?

47:33.112 --> 47:34.850
- [Nola] Shit me, that shit was crazy.

47:34.850 --> 47:37.122
- Me too, and I don't want none
of that weak ass wine shit.

47:37.122 --> 47:39.885
I want some hard fucking liquor.

47:39.885 --> 47:40.718
- [Nola] Crystal come on.

47:40.718 --> 47:41.976
Come have a drink with us.

47:41.976 --> 47:43.926
- No, I'm done.

47:43.926 --> 47:44.843
- [Dee] What you mean you're done?

47:44.843 --> 47:47.597
I ain't even poor nothing yet.

47:47.597 --> 47:48.738
- No I'm done.

47:48.738 --> 47:50.765
I'm done with all this with y'all.

47:50.765 --> 47:52.896
I can't live like this.

47:52.896 --> 47:54.584
I can't do this with y'all anymore, man.

47:54.584 --> 47:56.450
I just can't.

47:56.450 --> 47:58.445
I mean, we were just in a shootout.

47:58.445 --> 48:00.130
And we were the bad guys.

48:00.130 --> 48:01.442
And then I see this
nigga pointing a pistol

48:01.442 --> 48:03.137
at my sister and pull the trigger.

48:03.137 --> 48:04.554
And she shot him.

48:06.626 --> 48:07.661
- [Nola] That shit was gangsta.

48:07.661 --> 48:08.770
- [Daisy] No it wasn't.

48:08.770 --> 48:11.158
That shit was insane.

48:11.158 --> 48:15.491
Nola, I love y'all too, but
I can't do this anymore.

48:18.914 --> 48:21.497
- Well sis, let me talk to you.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.954
You're our good luck charm.

48:25.954 --> 48:27.745
Now out of all of us, you were

48:27.745 --> 48:32.226
the only one that done
right our whole life.

48:32.226 --> 48:37.226
If it wasn't for you, I
wouldn't even be alive tonight.

48:37.570 --> 48:42.153
And when Vinny pulled that
pistol out on me I was gone,

48:43.085 --> 48:44.280
but the only reason why I wasn't,

48:44.280 --> 48:46.348
because you screamed out "no"

48:46.348 --> 48:48.034
and that nigga flinched.

48:48.034 --> 48:51.032
And that's the only reason why he missed.

48:51.032 --> 48:53.858
But you know what was crazy
when you ran up in that building

48:53.858 --> 48:55.042
and cracked that security guard

48:55.042 --> 48:59.085
in the head with that
stick that shit was epic.

48:59.085 --> 49:00.085
We need you.

49:02.434 --> 49:07.117
- I know sis, but I'm sorry
I just can't do it anymore.

49:07.117 --> 49:09.186
- I respect that.

49:09.186 --> 49:12.141
But listen you still want your cut though?

49:12.141 --> 49:13.141
- Hell yeah.

49:14.743 --> 49:17.613
(upbeat music)

49:17.613 --> 49:19.613
- [Nola] Eat up bitches.

49:25.688 --> 49:26.605
- $187,000.

49:30.187 --> 49:33.187
Not bad for one night's work ladies.

49:34.296 --> 49:35.416
- Shit I can't believe I'm

49:35.416 --> 49:38.333
about to take homoe 47,000 in cash.

49:39.341 --> 49:40.174
- Nice.

49:42.904 --> 49:43.737
Real nice.

49:44.600 --> 49:47.350
(soothing music)

49:58.093 --> 49:59.343
- Hop in nigga.

50:00.184 --> 50:01.698
- What's up Nard?

50:01.698 --> 50:03.349
You got that.

50:03.349 --> 50:05.154
- Here you go.

50:05.154 --> 50:06.328
Copping your first big.

50:06.328 --> 50:07.949
You moving up out here in the streets.

50:07.949 --> 50:10.338
- Look when I go through
this eight I'm a holler

50:10.338 --> 50:12.194
at you for the rest of this brick.

50:12.194 --> 50:14.189
- Hey I ain't gotta count this, do I?

50:14.189 --> 50:15.607
- Nigga do whatever the fuck you want.

50:15.607 --> 50:17.524
You know where I be at.

50:20.344 --> 50:21.720
- Old raggedy bitch.

50:21.720 --> 50:24.321
Think she all that, because
she got on a new outfit.

50:24.321 --> 50:26.786
I remember her whole family
used to smell like pee.

50:26.786 --> 50:29.369
That's crazy as a motherfucker.

50:34.818 --> 50:35.651
- Ms. Drake I gotta say.

50:35.651 --> 50:39.832
This right here is a
real unexpected surprise.

50:39.832 --> 50:44.365
- Call me Nola from here
on out Professor Jackson.

50:44.365 --> 50:47.522
I appreciated your help so
much, from free tutoring

50:47.522 --> 50:49.462
and everything that you've done for me.

50:49.462 --> 50:52.088
So I figured that this is
the least that I can do

50:52.088 --> 50:53.784
to show you my appreciation.

50:53.784 --> 50:56.333
- Well thank you Nola.

50:56.333 --> 50:59.640
And from here on out just call me Damon.

50:59.640 --> 51:00.723
- Okay Damon.

51:01.965 --> 51:04.930
- Well listen, I gotta be honest.

51:04.930 --> 51:07.960
This whole tutoring thing
I had some ulterior motives

51:07.960 --> 51:12.013
behind it, and right now
I'm just kinda wanting

51:12.013 --> 51:15.426
to get to know you more
on a personal level.

51:15.426 --> 51:19.509
So why don't you tell me
how you feel about that?

51:27.703 --> 51:31.120
- My question to you is Damon wanna fuck?

52:38.232 --> 52:40.461
Just stop, you're scaring the baby.

52:40.461 --> 52:42.104
- Crystal open the door.

52:42.104 --> 52:45.784
I just wanna talk, and I
need to borrow some money.

52:45.784 --> 52:48.173
- Some money, some money.

52:48.173 --> 52:50.466
You haven't helped with shit
since the baby's been born.

52:50.466 --> 52:52.578
You don't even come to
see her or anything.

52:52.578 --> 52:54.189
Now you want some fucking money.

52:54.189 --> 52:55.586
No I'm taking care of our baby.

52:55.586 --> 52:57.250
I don't have the money for you Todd.

52:57.250 --> 52:58.157
(banging on the door)

52:58.157 --> 52:59.181
- Quit lying.

52:59.181 --> 53:00.864
You know my sister called me.

53:00.864 --> 53:03.426
She said she saw you at the
mall shopping, buying clothes

53:03.426 --> 53:05.357
for you and the baby.

53:05.357 --> 53:08.429
And she said you walked out
of there with hella bags.

53:08.429 --> 53:09.752
- Your sister.

53:09.752 --> 53:10.871
You know what Todd if you don't get

53:10.871 --> 53:13.069
away from my door, the police is coming.

53:13.069 --> 53:15.000
- Bitch you sound stupid.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.333
We live in Miami.

53:16.333 --> 53:18.008
Ain't nobody coming for this bullshit.

53:18.008 --> 53:19.328

53:19.328 --> 53:21.741
Now open the goddamn

53:21.741 --> 53:23.032
- You know what you right.

53:23.032 --> 53:25.782
But I do know how to call though.

53:26.754 --> 53:29.337
(phone buzzes)

53:32.246 --> 53:33.079
- Hello.

53:35.096 --> 53:36.596
Todd's doing what?

53:38.338 --> 53:40.930
Hold on let me call the girls.

53:40.930 --> 53:42.597
Fuck, piece of shit.

53:45.026 --> 53:47.526
(phone rings)

53:51.437 --> 53:52.270
- Hello.

53:53.570 --> 53:56.546
Her baby daddy trying to beat her ass.

53:56.546 --> 53:57.879
Come pick me up.

53:59.361 --> 54:02.194
(kicks door open)

54:03.927 --> 54:04.760
- Crystal.

54:08.013 --> 54:09.528
Crystal.

54:09.528 --> 54:12.195
(ominous music)

54:18.763 --> 54:20.263
- I hate you Todd.

54:25.112 --> 54:28.493
- Frigerator and freezer full of food.

54:28.493 --> 54:32.576
It ain't not one shut-off
notice on this counter.

54:33.624 --> 54:34.457
I don't know.

54:34.457 --> 54:36.790
That's not like you Crystal.

54:38.370 --> 54:40.787
- Please get out of my house.

54:53.912 --> 54:55.245
I hate you Todd.

54:59.181 --> 55:00.014
- Crystal.

55:13.154 --> 55:16.034
Crystal I just saw the
clothes that my sister said

55:16.034 --> 55:20.141
she saw you with, and I
went through your closet,

55:20.141 --> 55:21.410

55:21.410 --> 55:24.629

55:24.629 --> 55:26.712
some name brand shit too.

55:27.693 --> 55:30.146
So you definitely got you some money.

55:30.146 --> 55:34.274
You got three seconds to open
this door before I kick it in.

55:34.274 --> 55:35.191
Three, two.

55:39.693 --> 55:41.176
- Hey sis.

55:41.176 --> 55:42.926
You can come out now.

55:51.489 --> 55:54.906

56:07.436 --> 56:08.536
- [Todd] Come on man, hey.

56:08.536 --> 56:10.119
Easy man, what's...

56:12.342 --> 56:13.485
- Here.

56:13.485 --> 56:15.063
Got something, take it.

56:15.063 --> 56:19.798
Take this, in case this nigga
try to be on some bullshit.

56:19.798 --> 56:21.965
(ominous)

56:30.296 --> 56:32.796
(phone rings)

56:36.342 --> 56:37.175
Hello.

56:38.285 --> 56:39.285
- Nola baby.

56:40.824 --> 56:44.226
Why you ain't been to the
club in a minute girl?

56:44.226 --> 56:45.143
I miss you.

56:46.616 --> 56:47.449
What's up?

56:48.770 --> 56:51.489
- You know I quit the club life right.

56:51.489 --> 56:52.322
Yeah.

56:53.165 --> 56:57.238
I went back to school
just like we talked about.

56:57.238 --> 57:00.150
I mean, and that's about it.

57:00.150 --> 57:03.983
- Look check this video
I'm about to send you.

57:18.379 --> 57:20.844
- What's that got to do with me?

57:20.844 --> 57:23.629
- I know that was you and
your home girls in that video.

57:23.629 --> 57:25.645
Yeah, yeah, yeah but

57:25.645 --> 57:28.120
I got a job for you.

57:28.120 --> 57:29.260
Yeah one of my associates told me

57:29.260 --> 57:31.202

57:31.202 --> 57:32.285
500,000 easy.

57:34.040 --> 57:37.730
- So why you and your
crew just can't do it?

57:37.730 --> 57:38.647

Come on now.

57:39.597 --> 57:41.570
Look I done did too much

57:41.570 --> 57:43.042
All right, people know me.

57:43.042 --> 57:46.603
But you and your home girls,
y'all got a fresh face.

57:46.603 --> 57:47.842
The local drug dealers chopping

57:47.842 --> 57:50.552
up the shipment got cracks in their crew.

57:50.552 --> 57:52.312
They weak as fuck.

57:52.312 --> 57:54.253
That's how I got the address.

57:54.253 --> 57:56.800
But the Cubans bringing
the dope in, yeah, they new

57:56.800 --> 57:58.722
to the city, and they got hella rep

57:58.722 --> 58:00.619
back in their hometown.

58:00.619 --> 58:04.194
So don't take the dope, just the money.

58:04.194 --> 58:06.861
(ominous music)

58:11.224 --> 58:15.224
- This should be a start
of a good relationship.

58:17.474 --> 58:19.458
- All right, well as long
as this work is right,

58:19.458 --> 58:22.103
it's gonna be a beautiful relationship.

58:22.103 --> 58:26.020
- Rocko as you say, the
work speaks for itself.

58:27.362 --> 58:29.218
- Speaks for itself, but look.

58:29.218 --> 58:30.765
This 500,000.

58:30.765 --> 58:34.598
It's all in big bills
just like you requested.

58:39.255 --> 58:41.172
- Okay, it's all there.

58:42.476 --> 58:44.162
- That's what I'm talking about Rocko.

58:44.162 --> 58:46.562
- All right, look, this
should all move pretty fast.

58:46.562 --> 58:51.192

Let's check this shit out.

58:58.552 --> 59:00.034
- It's a set up.
- Calm the fuck down.

59:00.034 --> 59:02.349
- It's a set up.
- Look this ain't on us.

59:02.349 --> 59:03.672
- What the fuck Rocko?
- This ain't on us.

59:03.672 --> 59:05.976
Calm the fuck down.

59:05.976 --> 59:08.309
(guns fire)

59:10.712 --> 59:12.749
- [Luis] Fucking Rocko

59:12.749 --> 59:13.677

59:13.677 --> 59:16.260

59:17.698 --> 59:20.290
- Don't touch my fucking money.

59:20.290 --> 59:21.496
- [Nola] I got the money.

59:21.496 --> 59:23.245
- [Dee] What the fuck you

59:23.245 --> 59:24.632
- [Daisy] I'm taking this shit.

59:24.632 --> 59:25.465
- [Dee] Fuck it, grab it.

59:25.465 --> 59:26.466
Let's go.

59:26.466 --> 59:27.608
- Bitches better not.

59:27.608 --> 59:28.834
My dope.

59:28.834 --> 59:30.834
What the fuck you doing?

59:34.317 --> 59:36.317
- 133,000 cash all mine.

59:38.957 --> 59:41.954
- But why the fuck do we got this too?

59:41.954 --> 59:43.480
- Shit it was right there for the taking.

59:43.480 --> 59:45.666
And I couldn't help myself.

59:45.666 --> 59:48.728
- And Jake said take
the money, not the dope.

59:48.728 --> 59:50.146
What are we gonna do with all this?

59:50.146 --> 59:51.149
- Sell it.

59:51.149 --> 59:54.157
Shit, y'all might not be
drug dealers, but I am.

59:54.157 --> 59:56.162
And with this much dope, shit,

59:56.162 --> 01:00:00.745
I could be like Griselda
Blanco, the cocaine godmother.

01:00:01.634 --> 01:00:03.467
- Bitch are you crazy?

01:00:04.736 --> 01:00:08.642
- Oh so y'all talking about
the cocaine black widow.

01:00:08.642 --> 01:00:10.157
That bitch is dead.

01:00:10.157 --> 01:00:13.325
And everybody that fucked
with her is dead too.

01:00:13.325 --> 01:00:15.448
Do you want that to be us?

01:00:15.448 --> 01:00:20.354
- Wait, so it's okay if we rob
the black man, the brothers.

01:00:20.354 --> 01:00:21.506
But as soon as we hit a lick

01:00:21.506 --> 01:00:24.610
on some white motherfuckers,
then y'all get scared.

01:00:24.610 --> 01:00:26.637
Man fuck them foreign motherfuckers.

01:00:26.637 --> 01:00:27.639
I'm all about a dollar.

01:00:27.639 --> 01:00:29.058
What the fuck is 50 cent?

01:00:29.058 --> 01:00:31.437
- Daisy what the fuck
are you talking about?

01:00:31.437 --> 01:00:33.293
- I'm talking about I saw an opportunity

01:00:33.293 --> 01:00:35.106
to get the whole thing, not half.

01:00:35.106 --> 01:00:37.282
We got the whole pie now.

01:00:37.282 --> 01:00:38.541
- But Jake said do not--

01:00:38.541 --> 01:00:40.173
- Man fuck Jake.

01:00:40.173 --> 01:00:41.261
Man we The Bag Girls.

01:00:41.261 --> 01:00:42.678
We run this shit.

01:00:51.458 --> 01:00:52.791
- How'd that go?

01:00:53.634 --> 01:00:55.576
- It went well.

01:00:55.576 --> 01:00:58.040
I mean, we made it out safe.

01:00:58.040 --> 01:00:59.873
Yeah, we got your cut.

01:01:00.832 --> 01:01:02.332
- Good, real good.

01:01:04.589 --> 01:01:07.840
And you can drop that
off to me in the morning.

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:09.257
Good job my baby.

01:01:10.892 --> 01:01:12.725
- But one small thing.

01:01:13.965 --> 01:01:15.798
We also got that work.

01:01:16.865 --> 01:01:17.698
- What?

01:01:21.538 --> 01:01:23.038
Man what the fuck?

01:01:24.109 --> 01:01:24.942
- I don't fucking know.

01:01:24.942 --> 01:01:27.256
Shit just happened.

01:01:27.256 --> 01:01:30.673
- Man that's a bad move, a real bad move.

01:01:33.484 --> 01:01:35.704
- I mean, but listen,
if you help us sell it,

01:01:35.704 --> 01:01:37.208
we'll give you a nice little cut.

01:01:37.208 --> 01:01:39.489
How does that sound?

01:01:39.489 --> 01:01:42.872
- I don't usually do that, all right.

01:01:42.872 --> 01:01:46.274
But I'll make a few phone calls.

01:01:46.274 --> 01:01:47.107
Fuck Nola.

01:01:48.376 --> 01:01:50.027
Hey y'all should lay low.

01:01:50.027 --> 01:01:52.444
Take a vacation or something.

01:01:53.622 --> 01:01:55.289
- Yeah that's smart.

01:01:56.257 --> 01:01:58.090
So I'm thinking Vegas.

01:02:00.994 --> 01:02:03.494
- I'll see you in the morning.

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:08.493

01:11:34.506 --> 01:11:36.446
You putting that shit all on the Gram.

01:11:36.446 --> 01:11:38.099
That's not cool.

01:11:38.099 --> 01:11:39.016
- Okay and?

01:11:40.032 --> 01:11:42.112
- And Nola talk to her.

01:11:42.112 --> 01:11:43.936
I can't right now man.

01:11:43.936 --> 01:11:45.173
- Daisy look.

01:11:45.173 --> 01:11:47.765
We're still not in the clear
from these fucking Cubans.

01:11:47.765 --> 01:11:50.325
We can't be out here
spending a whole lot of money

01:11:50.325 --> 01:11:53.045
and then posting that
shit on the internet.

01:11:53.045 --> 01:11:55.104
You get killed for shit like that.

01:11:55.104 --> 01:11:56.490
- Look we good.

01:11:56.490 --> 01:11:57.323
I'm good.

01:11:58.207 --> 01:11:59.488
Fuck.

01:11:59.488 --> 01:12:02.240
I'm just trying to spend a
little bit of this money.

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:03.189
- Cuz.

01:12:03.189 --> 01:12:04.960
- Don't cuz me now Dee.

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:06.997
See ever since you got married you moved

01:12:06.997 --> 01:12:09.877
in your big ass house,
your fancy foreign cars,

01:12:09.877 --> 01:12:13.226
your red bottom shoes
while people like me,

01:12:13.226 --> 01:12:15.711
shit we just trying to survive.

01:12:15.711 --> 01:12:19.050
This my first time coming
up on some real money.

01:12:19.050 --> 01:12:20.948
Let me spend that shit.

01:12:20.948 --> 01:12:23.560
- Nobody is saying that
you can't spend no money,

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:25.589
but not right now.

01:12:25.589 --> 01:12:28.074
We can't afford to be too flashy.

01:12:28.074 --> 01:12:31.455
It's just drawing too much
unnecessary attention to us.

01:12:31.455 --> 01:12:32.842
The Cubans.

01:12:32.842 --> 01:12:34.089
- Nola fuck them Cubans.

01:12:34.089 --> 01:12:36.265
You know I'm ready for whatever.

01:12:36.265 --> 01:12:37.717
- Man Nola let's go.

01:12:37.717 --> 01:12:39.040
We can't talk to her right now.

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.298
This bitch drunk.

01:12:40.298 --> 01:12:42.208
- Look y'all just hit
me when the money come

01:12:42.208 --> 01:12:43.978
in from them bags.

01:12:43.978 --> 01:12:45.258
Shit, and if it don't come

01:12:45.258 --> 01:12:48.394
in too soon, I'll buy some bricks off it.

01:12:48.394 --> 01:12:49.322
You know I got the money.

01:12:49.322 --> 01:12:51.530
Now get out my fucking house.

01:12:51.530 --> 01:12:53.749
- Be at my place Friday evening

01:12:53.749 --> 01:12:55.264
and come get your cut.
- Man fuck y'all.

01:13:34.453 --> 01:13:36.362
(faintly speaking)

01:13:36.362 --> 01:13:38.362
- Let's take her inside.

01:13:40.617 --> 01:13:43.284
(ominous music)

01:13:46.281 --> 01:13:47.114
- That's Daisy.

01:13:47.114 --> 01:13:48.948
She about to pull up in a minute.

01:13:48.948 --> 01:13:49.781
- Good.

01:13:50.848 --> 01:13:52.233
(banging on door)

01:13:52.233 --> 01:13:53.696
Oh shit.

01:13:53.696 --> 01:13:55.946
That must be her right now.

01:14:03.125 --> 01:14:03.958
Who is it?

01:14:05.216 --> 01:14:06.197
- [Daisy] It's me.

01:14:06.197 --> 01:14:07.114
It's Daisy.

01:14:08.904 --> 01:14:09.941
- [Nola] Hey Daisy.

01:14:09.941 --> 01:14:11.370
What the fuck?

01:14:11.370 --> 01:14:12.533
- Come on.

01:14:12.533 --> 01:14:13.366
Keep walking.

01:14:13.366 --> 01:14:14.199
Come on.

01:14:22.496 --> 01:14:24.746
- [Cheva] You two sit down.

01:14:26.186 --> 01:14:28.340
- Pussy ass white boy.

01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:30.173
- [Tito] That's funny.

01:14:33.450 --> 01:14:35.829
- What do we have here Tito?

01:14:35.829 --> 01:14:37.829
Look, there's our money.

01:14:41.013 --> 01:14:42.762
- You brought these motherfuckers here.

01:14:42.762 --> 01:14:43.595
- Fuck no man.

01:14:43.595 --> 01:14:45.194
They read the fucking texts.

01:14:45.194 --> 01:14:47.349
Fucking address was
programmed in their phone.

01:14:47.349 --> 01:14:48.182
- Ladies.

01:14:49.365 --> 01:14:52.308
There's no time for bickering.

01:14:52.308 --> 01:14:55.975
Our money seems to be
two or $300,000 short.

01:14:58.581 --> 01:15:02.414
So if there is no more
pero, where the hell is

01:15:04.617 --> 01:15:07.136
the rest of the coca
you stole from my boss?

01:15:07.136 --> 01:15:09.136
- What fucking coke man?

01:15:11.733 --> 01:15:13.685
- [Nola] It's all gone.

01:15:13.685 --> 01:15:15.594
It's all gone.

01:15:15.594 --> 01:15:16.427
- Gone.

01:15:17.279 --> 01:15:18.946
Aye, where to mommy?

01:15:21.504 --> 01:15:22.671
Do you recall?

01:15:24.736 --> 01:15:26.506
Don't you recall?

01:15:26.506 --> 01:15:30.261
- I fucking sold it, and the
money's on the fucking table.

01:15:30.261 --> 01:15:31.261
Look inside.

01:15:32.405 --> 01:15:33.405
- That's it.

01:15:34.517 --> 01:15:35.350
- Right.

01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:36.350
- That's it.

01:15:38.954 --> 01:15:43.287
So (faintly speaking) drug dealers.

01:15:47.936 --> 01:15:49.877
(phone buzzes)

01:15:49.877 --> 01:15:51.710
You expecting company?

01:15:53.749 --> 01:15:55.370
- [Nola] No.

01:15:55.370 --> 01:15:57.037
- Let it ring bitch.

01:15:58.517 --> 01:16:01.642
- Look, this all the money we got here.

01:16:01.642 --> 01:16:05.962
But if you let me go, I got
like $200,000 at the crib.

01:16:05.962 --> 01:16:07.976
I could bring it back to you.

01:16:07.976 --> 01:16:11.593
Man that should make
us whole for the drugs.

01:16:11.593 --> 01:16:15.221
- It should make us whole for the cocaine.

01:16:15.221 --> 01:16:17.514
But the fact that you
shot my family members.

01:16:17.514 --> 01:16:21.120
What do you think the price
is to make us whole for that?

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:23.537
- Man, we ain't shoot nobody.

01:16:25.696 --> 01:16:27.722
- You're a good liar.

01:16:27.722 --> 01:16:28.722
- Hey Cheva.

01:16:30.025 --> 01:16:32.785
If she has $200,000 cash,

01:16:32.785 --> 01:16:35.367
then that probably means that these two

01:16:35.367 --> 01:16:37.095
probably have the same thing.

01:16:37.095 --> 01:16:38.918
(faintly speaking)

01:16:38.918 --> 01:16:41.361
- [Cheva] Sounds about right to me cousin.

01:16:41.361 --> 01:16:44.433
(faintly speaking)

01:16:44.433 --> 01:16:46.266
So this is your place.

01:16:48.145 --> 01:16:49.968
Where is the money?

01:16:49.968 --> 01:16:50.801
Get up.

01:16:50.801 --> 01:16:52.220
- No.
- Get up you bitch.

01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:53.053
- [Nola] No.

01:16:53.053 --> 01:16:54.364
No.
- Get up.

01:16:54.364 --> 01:16:55.364
- [Nola] No.

01:16:58.909 --> 01:16:59.742
- Get up.
- No.

01:16:59.742 --> 01:17:01.458
- [Cheva] Get up.

01:17:01.458 --> 01:17:02.801
(gun fires)

01:17:02.801 --> 01:17:05.134
(guns fire)

01:17:18.012 --> 01:17:20.634
- What the hell is going on up in here?

01:17:20.634 --> 01:17:22.384
- [Nola] Mr. Johnson.

01:17:28.138 --> 01:17:30.805
(ominous music)

01:17:44.922 --> 01:17:48.977
- Man they should be sending
goons to look for us real soon.

01:17:48.977 --> 01:17:51.420
- So should we pack up and run?

01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:52.892
- They ain't no running.

01:17:52.892 --> 01:17:55.857
They already know who we
are and our families`.

01:17:55.857 --> 01:17:57.927
You want them to pop up on grandma?

01:17:57.927 --> 01:17:58.927
- Shit, run.

01:17:59.761 --> 01:18:02.384
I never have, and I never will.

01:18:02.384 --> 01:18:04.369
- Hey you think you could call Jake

01:18:04.369 --> 01:18:06.106
and see where they be at?

01:18:06.106 --> 01:18:08.977
- Probably, I don't really know though.

01:18:08.977 --> 01:18:12.432
- Well I think it's time
we take the fight to them.

01:18:12.432 --> 01:18:14.247
- Let's do it.

01:18:14.247 --> 01:18:15.247
- I'm ready.

01:18:20.327 --> 01:18:23.771
- [Nola] Okay, so the club in South Beach?

01:18:23.771 --> 01:18:25.021
I know exactly.

01:18:26.407 --> 01:18:27.407
Thanks Jake.

01:18:28.540 --> 01:18:31.164
This might be our last ride.

01:18:31.164 --> 01:18:33.649
And I always wanted to rent
one of those exotic cars

01:18:33.649 --> 01:18:36.232
in South Beach, so let's do it.

01:18:40.401 --> 01:18:43.674
- Should've heard back from Cheva by now.

01:18:43.674 --> 01:18:45.091
- Mateo trust me.

01:18:46.033 --> 01:18:48.282
Cheva will come back with good news.

01:18:48.282 --> 01:18:49.115
Promise.

01:18:53.948 --> 01:18:56.615
(ominous music)

01:19:46.885 --> 01:19:49.243
(banging on door)

01:19:49.243 --> 01:19:50.993
- Go see who that is.

01:19:54.756 --> 01:19:55.673
- This guy.

01:20:06.288 --> 01:20:08.788
(door buzzes)

01:20:12.003 --> 01:20:14.253
I told you he would return.

01:20:19.035 --> 01:20:20.202
Cheva come in.

01:20:28.518 --> 01:20:29.351
- Tito.

01:20:43.483 --> 01:20:45.254
(gun fires)

01:20:45.254 --> 01:20:46.982
Cheva what the fuck?

01:20:46.982 --> 01:20:49.315
(guns fire)

01:21:19.187 --> 01:21:22.020
(Crystal screams)

01:21:25.097 --> 01:21:25.960
- [Nola] Hang in there.

01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:27.838
Hang in there.

01:21:27.838 --> 01:21:29.534
- I did good?

01:21:29.534 --> 01:21:30.505
- [Nola] You did good, but come on.

01:21:30.505 --> 01:21:31.582
We gotta get up outta here.

01:21:31.582 --> 01:21:35.249
Come on (faintly speaking).

01:21:36.254 --> 01:21:38.587
(guns fire)

01:22:04.083 --> 01:22:06.833
- [Dee] I'm going to get the car.

01:22:08.967 --> 01:22:10.217
- [Tito] Mateo.

01:22:17.449 --> 01:22:18.321
- [Daisy] Your sister first.

01:22:18.321 --> 01:22:19.154
Come on.

01:22:28.137 --> 01:22:30.515
- Fucking piece of shit.

01:22:30.515 --> 01:22:31.806
Fuck out of here.

01:22:31.806 --> 01:22:34.291
Come, first you rob me.

01:22:34.291 --> 01:22:36.467
Then you shoot up my fucking club.

01:22:36.467 --> 01:22:38.345
Then you kill Mateo.

01:22:38.345 --> 01:22:39.591
Fucking whore.

01:22:39.591 --> 01:22:41.758
Get the fuck off me bitch.

01:22:47.091 --> 01:22:47.924
- [Daisy] Don't trip.

01:22:47.924 --> 01:22:49.353
I'm about to get you to
the hospital right now.

01:22:49.353 --> 01:22:50.802
- [Crystal] Thank you.

01:22:50.802 --> 01:22:51.795
You got shot too.

01:22:51.795 --> 01:22:52.829
- [Daisy] Yeah it's just a graze though.

01:22:52.829 --> 01:22:53.662
Don't trip.

01:22:53.662 --> 01:22:55.294
I'm about to get your sister.

01:22:55.294 --> 01:22:56.127
Shit.

01:22:56.990 --> 01:22:58.569
- [Tito] Die.

01:22:58.569 --> 01:23:00.902
(gun fires)

01:23:07.208 --> 01:23:08.708
- [Nola] You okay?

01:23:35.528 --> 01:23:37.502
Stay woke sis.

01:23:37.502 --> 01:23:38.471

01:24:48.798 --> 01:24:52.510
- So you say they were
trying to carjack you?

01:24:52.510 --> 01:24:54.888
- And they must've been.

01:24:54.888 --> 01:24:58.931
We just rented that
Bentley for a girls' night.

01:24:58.931 --> 01:25:00.094
That's the only reason why

01:25:00.094 --> 01:25:04.427
I could think that something
like this would happen.

01:25:05.363 --> 01:25:08.530
You know if my friend Crystal is okay?

01:25:09.749 --> 01:25:13.630
- Have to check with the doc on that one.

01:25:13.630 --> 01:25:18.630
- Your friend is very lucky
you got her here when you did.

01:25:18.910 --> 01:25:23.165
She lost a lot of blood,
but she should be okay.

01:25:23.165 --> 01:25:25.033
She's regained consciousness,

01:25:25.033 --> 01:25:28.414
and you can see her in about an hour.

01:25:28.414 --> 01:25:30.931
- Thank you so much doc.

01:25:30.931 --> 01:25:33.918
Do you know if my other friend is okay?

01:25:33.918 --> 01:25:35.091
- Which one?

01:25:35.091 --> 01:25:39.219
It was a car full of
gunshot victims, right.

01:25:39.219 --> 01:25:41.386
- Nola Drake, is she okay?

01:25:42.824 --> 01:25:45.182
- Yes Ms. Drake will be fine.

01:25:45.182 --> 01:25:48.211
We're just starting to
prep her for surgery.

01:25:48.211 --> 01:25:49.211
- Thank God.

01:25:50.643 --> 01:25:55.283
- I'll be back in a little
while with an update.

01:25:55.283 --> 01:25:56.366
- Thanks doc.

01:25:58.462 --> 01:26:00.200
- All right.

01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:02.505
Can you describe for me
the make, model, color

01:26:02.505 --> 01:26:06.045
or year of the vehicle
the shooters were in?

01:26:06.045 --> 01:26:07.614
- Look I'm a be honest.

01:26:07.614 --> 01:26:09.553
I ain't see shit.

01:26:09.553 --> 01:26:11.102
I was high as hell.

01:26:11.102 --> 01:26:13.342
My head was back with my eyes closed.

01:26:13.342 --> 01:26:15.230
I was just enjoying the weather.

01:26:15.230 --> 01:26:17.235
All of a sudden I hear gunshots.

01:26:17.235 --> 01:26:19.582
So I ducked to the floor.

01:26:19.582 --> 01:26:20.958
When I picked my head up

01:26:20.958 --> 01:26:24.414
and the shots stopped, I
realized my friends was hit.

01:26:24.414 --> 01:26:27.998
I got grazed in the shoulder,
and we came straight here.

01:26:27.998 --> 01:26:28.831
- Wait.

01:26:30.046 --> 01:26:33.937
So you're telling me you
didn't see the vehicle at all?

01:26:33.937 --> 01:26:35.571
- No.

01:26:35.571 --> 01:26:37.154
I was just driving.

01:26:38.355 --> 01:26:42.279
Next thing I know this car
pulled up on the side of us.

01:26:42.279 --> 01:26:46.344
I seen these lights start
flashing on the side of my eye.

01:26:46.344 --> 01:26:51.038
Then I heard the bullets
ricocheting off of the car.

01:26:51.038 --> 01:26:53.406
I put my head down.

01:26:53.406 --> 01:26:54.601
I put my foot on the peddle,

01:26:54.601 --> 01:26:56.115
and I just pressed as hard as I could,

01:26:56.115 --> 01:26:57.532
and I just drove.

01:26:58.643 --> 01:27:02.409
By the time I looked up
I saw my girls was hit.

01:27:02.409 --> 01:27:04.992
And I brought us straight here.

01:27:06.321 --> 01:27:09.071
- How'd you get that bloody nose?

01:27:10.473 --> 01:27:13.918
- I must've pulled my head
down so fast I hit my nose

01:27:13.918 --> 01:27:15.881
on the steering wheel.

01:27:15.881 --> 01:27:18.214
- So were they black, Latin,

01:27:20.732 --> 01:27:22.078
or white dudes who were
doing the shooting?

01:27:22.078 --> 01:27:23.166
- Who said it was dudes?

01:27:23.166 --> 01:27:24.595
- Who said it wasn't?

01:27:24.595 --> 01:27:26.398
- Look lady, I told you I ain't see shit.

01:27:26.398 --> 01:27:27.614
- I know.

01:27:27.614 --> 01:27:29.171
I know.

01:27:29.171 --> 01:27:31.881
Your eyes were closed, right?

01:27:31.881 --> 01:27:34.881
- That's what I said.
- Right, right.

01:27:38.334 --> 01:27:39.167
Hey Heard.

01:27:40.467 --> 01:27:43.763
- Is there anything you
can tell me, any reason

01:27:43.763 --> 01:27:45.449
at all why you think
somebody would wanna do this

01:27:45.449 --> 01:27:47.199
to you or your girls?

01:27:48.979 --> 01:27:51.979
- I don't know, man, jealousy, envy.

01:27:53.950 --> 01:27:57.705
People always want
something that ain't theirs.

01:27:57.705 --> 01:27:58.872
- Yeah I know.

01:28:00.072 --> 01:28:00.905
It's sad.

01:28:00.905 --> 01:28:01.738
Isn't it?

01:28:02.953 --> 01:28:04.370
- Yeah, real sad.

01:28:07.934 --> 01:28:09.767
- Well here's my card.

01:28:12.435 --> 01:28:14.564
I'm Detective Heard.

01:28:14.564 --> 01:28:16.966
Give me a call if you
remember anything at all.

01:28:16.966 --> 01:28:17.990
Okay?

01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:19.823
- All right thank you.

01:28:30.886 --> 01:28:33.469
(upbeat music)

01:28:45.945 --> 01:28:48.252
The vault only opens up one time a day.

01:28:48.252 --> 01:28:49.990
And that's in three minutes.

01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:54.001
Daisy and Crystal y'all take
the two security guards.

01:28:54.001 --> 01:28:54.834
- Got it.

01:28:55.824 --> 01:28:57.286
- We wanna get in and out.

01:28:57.286 --> 01:28:58.321
So if anybody in there try

01:28:58.321 --> 01:29:00.732
to play hero, what do we do?

01:29:00.732 --> 01:29:03.153
- We lay 'em the fuck down.

01:29:03.153 --> 01:29:05.711
- Listen, Dee and I gotta
go in the vault, okay.

01:29:05.711 --> 01:29:07.569
We can't waste any time at the tellers.

01:29:07.569 --> 01:29:08.591
All y'all gotta do is watch out

01:29:08.591 --> 01:29:10.396
for the security and the people.

01:29:10.396 --> 01:29:11.324
Understood?

01:29:11.324 --> 01:29:13.073
- Yeah, understand.

01:29:13.073 --> 01:29:14.481
- [Dee] Good.

01:29:14.481 --> 01:29:16.314
- Ladies, y'all ready?

01:29:18.897 --> 01:29:19.921
Let's do this.

01:29:19.921 --> 01:29:20.838
Masks down.

01:29:25.009 --> 01:29:26.759
- Let's do this shit.

01:29:29.073 --> 01:29:32.406
- [Dee] Bag Girls, let's get this money.
