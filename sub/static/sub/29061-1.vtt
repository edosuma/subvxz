00:38.234 --> 00:39.545
- How dare you?
- Just calm down!

00:39.547 --> 00:41.790
Of all the
men in the world, why?

00:42.136 --> 00:43.134
- What's this?
- Tell me why

00:43.136 --> 00:45.464
- you went behind my back.
- You need to calm down!

00:57.182 --> 00:58.932
Oh, oh my goodness!

00:59.231 --> 01:01.031
Are you okay, are you okay?

01:01.033 --> 01:02.129
Excuse me, help!

01:02.131 --> 01:03.399
Where are you going?

01:03.401 --> 01:04.431
What's going on?

01:04.433 --> 01:05.940
Can somebody help me?

01:05.942 --> 01:06.809
Can somebody help me?

01:06.811 --> 01:08.740
My God, somebody help!

01:08.742 --> 01:10.161
I need an ambulance!

01:10.163 --> 01:11.941
The lady's right in front of my car!

01:11.943 --> 01:13.935
Wake up, miss, are you okay?

01:13.937 --> 01:14.926
Yes, she's moving.

01:14.928 --> 01:17.178
I don't know, are you okay?

02:49.790 --> 02:50.623
- Hey.
- Hi.

02:51.010 --> 02:52.043
Where are you?

02:52.880 --> 02:55.663
I'm outside the station,
opposite High Street.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.872
Are you here?

02:57.874 --> 02:59.623
Yeah, I know, I will.

03:00.870 --> 03:02.253
No one's gonna see me.

03:04.060 --> 03:06.423
Hi, yeah, sorry, are you alone?

03:06.780 --> 03:07.611
Yes.

03:07.613 --> 03:10.128
Come to the corner of Crown Lane.

03:10.130 --> 03:10.963
It's quiet.

03:12.180 --> 03:14.208
Make sure nobody sees you.

03:14.210 --> 03:15.041
Why?

03:15.043 --> 03:15.876
Just do it.

03:24.002 --> 03:25.078
Alpha officers,

03:25.080 --> 03:26.523
suspect in your vicinity.

03:27.140 --> 03:28.575
Exact location known, street name?

03:28.577 --> 03:31.458
Pathway off Chase Road South.

03:31.460 --> 03:34.173
Two foot paths off Chase
Road South, which one?

03:35.071 --> 03:36.723
The
path to the chief station.

04:03.914 --> 04:05.242
No, no!

04:05.244 --> 04:06.682
It's me, it's me, it's me, okay?

04:06.684 --> 04:08.978
All right, all right, I
know, I know, just shush.

04:08.980 --> 04:12.170
I'll explain, come on, just come, come on!

04:15.150 --> 04:17.517
Diana, wait, wait!

04:17.519 --> 04:18.978
So I have got the property details.

04:18.980 --> 04:20.879
Your name's on the
, and your dad...

04:20.880 --> 04:21.808
Have you got the flight ticket?

04:21.810 --> 04:22.760
That's what I need.

04:22.762 --> 04:23.770
I've brought this.

04:23.772 --> 04:25.028
- Brilliant.
- What?

04:25.030 --> 04:26.988
It's a police officer!

04:26.990 --> 04:27.823
Where?

04:28.210 --> 04:29.628
They're looking for me!

04:29.630 --> 04:32.438
Oh, Diana, that is not a police officer!

04:32.440 --> 04:35.873
It's a traffic warden, and
they are not looking for you!

04:37.020 --> 04:38.693
Jesus Christ, Diana!

04:39.210 --> 04:40.823
How has it even got to this?

04:41.120 --> 04:42.603
What is going on?

04:46.763 --> 04:49.180
Just come on, just come on!

04:57.032 --> 04:57.865
Diana!

04:59.473 --> 05:00.973
Okay, I'm sorry.

05:01.930 --> 05:04.380
I'm really sorry, just
please give me the ticket,

05:05.020 --> 05:06.077
the flight ticket.

05:06.079 --> 05:07.288
You need to tell me what's going on.

05:07.290 --> 05:09.440
Just please give me the ticket.

05:09.761 --> 05:11.178
- Fine!
- Come on!

05:13.460 --> 05:15.313
Why Egypt anyway?

05:16.270 --> 05:19.233
Because, 'cause I'm safe there,

05:19.650 --> 05:21.300
and they can't send me back here.

05:21.620 --> 05:22.828
Diana, what is going on?

05:22.830 --> 05:24.523
Why are you running from the law?

05:26.720 --> 05:27.553
Diana!

05:36.272 --> 05:37.689
Hello, Michael?

05:39.640 --> 05:40.473
Where are you?

05:42.210 --> 05:44.528
No, I have to leave here within two hours

05:44.530 --> 05:45.730
or I'll miss the flight.

05:47.418 --> 05:48.251
Perfect.

05:48.880 --> 05:52.373
Okay, meet me on the
corner of Burnley Gardens.

05:54.220 --> 05:55.598
Yeah, okay, yeah, yeah.

05:55.600 --> 05:56.843
All right, thanks, my boy.

06:01.991 --> 06:02.824
Okay,

06:04.700 --> 06:06.038
all right, so you know Robert.

06:06.040 --> 06:08.708
So he keeps saying that we've broken up.

06:08.710 --> 06:09.618
You have broken up.

06:09.620 --> 06:11.608
The thing is I just don't
know what else to say about it...

06:11.610 --> 06:13.403
He's gone off with someone else!

06:14.220 --> 06:15.928
I just don't know
what to do about it anymore.

06:15.930 --> 06:16.763
Diana.

06:18.219 --> 06:20.527
It's the police, let's go, come on, Diana!

06:20.529 --> 06:22.779
Oh, sorry, sorry.

06:26.631 --> 06:27.464
Okay.

06:29.935 --> 06:32.009
Breathe, just chill, just calm.

06:32.011 --> 06:32.954
I'm calm, I'm so calm.

06:32.956 --> 06:36.410
Okay, so I'm gonna drive
you to the airport in my car.

06:36.412 --> 06:37.484
Are you driving?

06:37.486 --> 06:39.573
- Yes, I just said that.
- Okay.

06:39.575 --> 06:41.337
And they were there ,

06:41.339 --> 06:43.365
but we need to try and
find it because I can't,

06:43.367 --> 06:45.367
it's all Robert's fault!

06:45.628 --> 06:46.984
He promised me he was
gonna get married to me.

06:46.986 --> 06:47.925
Did you see the wedding dress?

06:47.927 --> 06:48.824
- I had my...
- Stop!

06:48.826 --> 06:50.982
Calm, calm, breathe in through the nose,

06:50.984 --> 06:52.784
out through the mouth, just stay calm.

06:52.786 --> 06:54.395
- Act normal.
- I'm calm!

06:54.397 --> 06:55.744
Don't think you are, but anyway.

06:55.746 --> 06:56.925
- Where's my car?
- Which way?

06:56.927 --> 06:57.758
- Which way, which way?
- This way, this way.

07:01.338 --> 07:02.455
Did you see anything?

07:02.457 --> 07:03.904
No, nothing, what about you?

07:03.906 --> 07:04.823
No, damn.

07:05.887 --> 07:09.554
Right, let's try.

07:13.038 --> 07:15.746
Right there, come on, let's go, Diana!

07:22.798 --> 07:23.631
Hurry up!

07:27.558 --> 07:28.641
Oh, my God!

07:29.028 --> 07:32.248
- What is that?
- In the back, hold on.

07:32.250 --> 07:33.350
Scared the...

07:33.940 --> 07:34.773
Just get in!

07:34.977 --> 07:36.394
I'm in, I'm in!

07:38.091 --> 07:40.028
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

07:40.030 --> 07:40.972
We need to hurry up, stop!

07:40.974 --> 07:42.492
Why, why?

07:42.494 --> 07:43.391
It's the police officers!

07:43.393 --> 07:44.226
Where?

07:44.473 --> 07:45.500
Oh, my God, oh, my God!

07:45.502 --> 07:46.853
Go now!

07:47.850 --> 07:49.791
What is going on, seriously?

07:49.793 --> 07:51.380
Where are we?

07:51.382 --> 07:52.348
Right, when you get to
the end of the road,

07:52.350 --> 07:54.000
I need you to take the next left.

07:54.394 --> 07:56.148
- Where's that?
- The next left, okay?

07:56.150 --> 07:56.983
Please.

07:58.900 --> 07:59.731
What's down there?

07:59.733 --> 08:01.173
Why are we going left?

08:09.839 --> 08:12.756
I'm borrowing this, okay?

08:16.360 --> 08:17.191
This one?

08:17.193 --> 08:19.723
Yeah, yeah.

08:20.288 --> 08:21.358
Okay.

08:21.360 --> 08:22.193
Okay.

08:26.797 --> 08:27.630
Okay.

08:31.588 --> 08:32.421
Okay.

08:32.809 --> 08:33.860
Okay, stop!

08:34.288 --> 08:35.246
Diana, what are you doing?

08:35.249 --> 08:36.080
Get in!

08:36.082 --> 08:37.698
No, I know what to do.

08:37.700 --> 08:38.857
I need the mannequin

08:38.860 --> 08:39.831
and I need you to get my
suitcases out the car.

08:39.832 --> 08:41.768
- But why?
- Just do it, please!

08:41.770 --> 08:42.893
Please, T!

08:44.303 --> 08:46.386
Panicking, I'm panicking.

08:48.038 --> 08:48.928
Oh, my God, Diana!

08:48.930 --> 08:50.708
I need you to distract them.

08:50.710 --> 08:53.841
Do whatever you need to do to
distract the police, please.

08:53.843 --> 08:56.613
Diana, okay, I will,
I will, but please...

08:56.615 --> 08:58.338
Please, thank you.

08:58.340 --> 09:00.817
Thank you, I'll speak
to you, I'll call you.

10:16.020 --> 10:17.594
The thing is, what I was saying,

10:17.596 --> 10:18.613
the thing is, it's Robert,
'cause I called you

10:18.615 --> 10:20.493
- just after I spoke to him...
- Excuse me, officers!

10:20.495 --> 10:22.394
And then, the thing, no
one can blame me for that...

10:22.396 --> 10:23.674
You know the woman I was with,

10:23.676 --> 10:25.608
I don't know why I kept running from you,

10:25.610 --> 10:27.935
but she's heading to the
airport, she's going aboard...

10:27.937 --> 10:29.268
- Slow down.
- She's going to Egy...

10:29.270 --> 10:30.958
What woman, what are
you trying to tell us?

10:30.960 --> 10:33.418
My friend who I was with,
she's running from you.

10:33.420 --> 10:34.885
She's been running from you all day,

10:34.887 --> 10:36.405
and she got the red hair!

10:36.407 --> 10:37.695
No, I think you're confused.

10:37.697 --> 10:38.855
I'm really sorry.

14:42.621 --> 14:45.071
Course he's not lost
it, he's texting me on it.

14:46.650 --> 14:47.483
Losing my mind.

14:48.740 --> 14:53.740
Oh!

15:16.080 --> 15:17.163
Hi, Martha, it's me.

15:18.690 --> 15:21.718
Yeah, I'm good, I just thought
I'd give you a security call,

15:21.720 --> 15:24.728
so you know I haven't
slain myself.

15:24.730 --> 15:26.993
No, it doesn't matter.

15:28.340 --> 15:31.668
Yeah, so I'm meetin' with
him Saturday after next.

15:31.670 --> 15:33.920
He's just gonna come
around, and then at the,

15:35.780 --> 15:36.613
well, obviously before the wedding.

15:36.800 --> 15:38.313
Otherwise, it would be pointless.

15:40.650 --> 15:43.350
Well, what do you suggest I
do then if not seduce him?

15:45.270 --> 15:46.103
I know.

15:46.952 --> 15:47.785
I know.

15:50.393 --> 15:51.226
I know.

15:54.212 --> 15:56.878
Well, I know that's a possibility,

15:56.880 --> 15:59.380
but I just don't wanna
think about that right now.

16:01.638 --> 16:02.471
Bye.

17:30.657 --> 17:32.659
Robby, it's me, it's D.

17:32.661 --> 17:37.661
Can you call me back, please,
when you get this message?

17:44.319 --> 17:45.838
Robby, can you call me back, please?

17:45.840 --> 17:47.340
I need you to call me, please.

17:59.242 --> 18:00.075
Martha?

18:01.600 --> 18:03.693
Martha, he's wedding her tomorrow.

18:05.150 --> 18:09.008
No, he just called me to tell
me he's moved the wedding

18:09.010 --> 18:11.453
from my birthday on the 24th to tomorrow!

18:13.010 --> 18:14.998
No, I'm the one who asked
him to have some respect

18:15.000 --> 18:16.773
and not have it on my birthday!

18:17.482 --> 18:19.988
Oh, this isn't how it's supposed to go,

18:19.990 --> 18:23.383
I just wanted some more time!

18:23.730 --> 18:26.148
Oh, Martha, why does this happen to me?

18:26.150 --> 18:28.688
Two years, we're great, then he ran off,

18:28.690 --> 18:32.823
and then four years
without Amelia, and now,

18:33.180 --> 18:34.503
five years with Robert.

18:37.989 --> 18:39.822
We're losin' our baby.

18:48.440 --> 18:51.203
No one will use me like
this again, Martha!

18:51.660 --> 18:53.123
No, I'm not scorned.

18:53.990 --> 18:56.393
No, I won't let him go, Martha, go away!

19:07.929 --> 19:09.381
Martha, I'm sorry.

19:09.383 --> 19:11.447
I'm sorry, I'm taking this all out on you

19:11.449 --> 19:13.758
as if it's your fault, and
as if you're responsible,

19:13.760 --> 19:14.908
which, obviously, you're not.

19:14.910 --> 19:16.083
I'm so sorry.

19:17.480 --> 19:19.043
You're the only friend I've got,

19:19.929 --> 19:21.779
the only shoulder I've had to cry on.

19:23.716 --> 19:26.163
Yeah, I'll be
fine eventually, yeah.

19:27.220 --> 19:29.163
He sent me a text!

19:30.690 --> 19:32.528
He hasn't picked up his
phone for three days!

19:32.530 --> 19:33.458
He's staying at Michael's.

19:33.460 --> 19:35.510
They don't pick up their landline either.

19:36.730 --> 19:39.913
They're all just sittin'
there avoiding me.

19:44.409 --> 19:45.453
Yeah.

19:47.960 --> 19:50.838
He's just so cruel, and
he's just an asshole!

19:50.840 --> 19:54.360
I spent a fortune on him,
and I tried everything!

19:55.385 --> 19:57.462
I know.

19:57.464 --> 19:58.698
I know he's not.

19:58.700 --> 20:01.658
He even bought the wedding
dress, can't believe it.

20:01.660 --> 20:02.963
He said he loved it.

20:03.650 --> 20:05.378
No, I won't let it go!

20:05.380 --> 20:08.433
All I can think of right now is to,

20:09.820 --> 20:11.348
is just to go to the wedding tomorrow

20:11.350 --> 20:15.518
and walk in and tell the
priest and all the guests

20:15.520 --> 20:18.928
that he's been living here
with me like I was his wife

20:18.930 --> 20:21.040
for the last five years,
and now he's run off

20:21.348 --> 20:23.178
to be with some other woman!

20:23.180 --> 20:25.848
I'm not gonna ruin anything,
I won't disturb anything.

20:25.850 --> 20:27.168
I'm just gonna go in

20:27.170 --> 20:29.320
and then say what I've
gotta say, and then,

20:30.580 --> 20:34.763
oh, Martha, your husband
married you, not another woman,

20:35.600 --> 20:39.208
and you ran off with that
sad, pathetic, ugly, old man

20:39.210 --> 20:41.438
who left you after two months!

20:41.440 --> 20:42.583
What do you know?

20:49.785 --> 20:52.202
You're not a furious old hen.

20:53.738 --> 20:57.828
You're beautiful
and you're strong!

20:57.830 --> 20:59.413
And you'll stop that wedding!

21:03.896 --> 21:04.729
Never!

21:06.376 --> 21:07.209
Ever!

21:19.850 --> 21:20.683
Hello, Robert?

21:21.410 --> 21:22.243
Hi.

21:23.560 --> 21:24.863
It's really noisy.

21:25.370 --> 21:27.778
There's like a continuous
whining noise on the line.

21:27.780 --> 21:28.863
You're breaking up.

21:29.880 --> 21:31.233
Hello, Robert, can you...

21:49.750 --> 21:50.583
Hello?

21:51.470 --> 21:52.573
Oh, Robert.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.423
Yeah, that's so much better.

21:54.780 --> 21:56.830
I couldn't really hear anything just now.

21:58.240 --> 21:59.073
Yes.

21:59.480 --> 22:01.693
I'm fine, thank you, and you?

22:03.750 --> 22:07.093
Oh, I only got in 10 minutes ago.

22:07.750 --> 22:09.110
Did you call earlier?

22:11.350 --> 22:12.203
Oh, okay.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.143
No, no, I've not been crying.

22:16.640 --> 22:18.093
No, no, no.

22:20.162 --> 22:22.843
Church, I just got in from church, yeah.

22:25.440 --> 22:26.493
Last night?

22:29.640 --> 22:30.978
I just went to bed.

22:30.980 --> 22:33.173
I couldn't sleep, so I took a tablet.

22:34.150 --> 22:35.293
No, only one.

22:36.990 --> 22:38.398
I had a headache, but it's gone now.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.150
Actually, I feel okay this morning.

22:40.380 --> 22:43.308
Martha came over, we had
lunch, we did some shopping,

22:43.310 --> 22:45.560
and I put all your
letters in the yellow bag.

22:47.850 --> 22:49.900
I told you, I went to church with Martha.

22:51.810 --> 22:52.643
Good.

22:53.430 --> 22:57.340
She is a perfect friend, you know that?

22:58.179 --> 22:59.012
She's so

23:00.260 --> 23:03.323
strong, such a strong
shoulder, she's so patient.

23:05.860 --> 23:07.360
Yeah, you always thought that.

23:07.658 --> 23:09.308
I don't know, maybe you're right.

23:10.120 --> 23:13.068
I wore my pink dress
with the black collar,

23:13.070 --> 23:14.113
and my black hat.

23:14.990 --> 23:16.713
Yes, I've still got them on now.

23:18.460 --> 23:19.363
Who, me?

23:20.290 --> 23:21.193
Smoking, no.

23:23.520 --> 23:24.983
I maybe had, like, three.

23:25.680 --> 23:27.878
What about you, have you just come in?

23:27.880 --> 23:29.158
What have you been doing?

23:29.160 --> 23:30.053
Are you home?

23:32.140 --> 23:34.033
Yes, yeah, the letter bag, yeah.

23:35.130 --> 23:35.963
Hello?

23:36.490 --> 23:37.321
Hello?

23:37.323 --> 23:38.308
Robert, I can't hear you again.

23:38.310 --> 23:39.958
You've gone all weird,
like you're underwater.

23:39.960 --> 23:41.173
Can you hear me?

23:42.730 --> 23:45.213
Robert, you're gonna cut off.

23:45.530 --> 23:48.268
I'll call you straight back,
or call me straight back.

23:48.270 --> 23:49.683
Please, oh.

23:50.410 --> 23:51.243
Okay.

23:51.790 --> 23:53.440
Yeah, I can hear you again, yeah.

23:55.270 --> 23:57.378
The letter bag, yeah, all
your letters are here,

23:57.380 --> 23:58.608
yours and some of mine.

23:58.610 --> 24:00.810
You can come and get
them whenever you want.

24:02.490 --> 24:04.340
Why is it difficult to come get them?

24:07.840 --> 24:08.673
I understand.

24:12.120 --> 24:12.953
So?

24:18.760 --> 24:20.760
Listen, Robert, does that mean that our,

24:21.890 --> 24:23.603
our weekend together is off?

24:24.160 --> 24:26.010
You're getting married tomorrow then?

24:28.760 --> 24:30.113
We'll be over forever?

24:42.709 --> 24:43.542
Yeah.

24:47.309 --> 24:48.360
I'm still here.

24:50.829 --> 24:51.938
Can I just call you back in a minute?

24:51.940 --> 24:53.543
I just need a few minutes.

24:54.790 --> 24:55.623
Yeah.

24:56.180 --> 24:59.080
Okay, but just promise me
you'll pick up when I call back.

24:59.600 --> 25:02.047
Okay, I'll speak to you in a minute.

25:55.000 --> 25:55.833
Hi, Robby.

25:57.410 --> 25:58.488
I'm fine, honestly.

25:58.490 --> 26:00.853
Listen, I just spoke to Martha.

26:01.570 --> 26:03.920
Yeah, she'd really love
to come to the wedding.

26:04.441 --> 26:06.518
You know she was always so fond of you.

26:06.520 --> 26:08.021
Well, sometimes, I thought you
were quite fond of her too,

26:08.023 --> 26:11.253
but that's just my own insecurities.

26:12.470 --> 26:14.163
Yeah, sure, no, I won't come.

26:14.770 --> 26:16.568
No, she'll come on her own, definitely.

26:16.570 --> 26:18.417
I'm sure if you invite her, she..

26:22.530 --> 26:24.138
Who, what act?

26:24.140 --> 26:25.213
An act, me?

26:26.300 --> 26:28.423
Oh, you know me better than that.

26:29.270 --> 26:30.973
Why would you say such a thing?

26:36.100 --> 26:38.168
What, you're gonna send
an invitation, what, now?

26:38.170 --> 26:40.170
The wedding's tomorrow, there's no time.

26:40.350 --> 26:42.398
Well, why don't you just
give me the address,

26:42.400 --> 26:44.403
and then I will pass it on to her?

26:45.290 --> 26:46.343
Sure I will.

26:46.810 --> 26:49.448
No, I won't attend the wedding,
she will come on her own.

26:49.450 --> 26:51.453
Honestly, she really wants to come.

26:59.480 --> 27:00.313
Okay.

27:10.595 --> 27:11.553
Aw, no!

27:45.320 --> 27:46.153
Hi, Robert.

27:47.030 --> 27:49.180
Oh, thank goodness, I
thought I'd lost you.

27:52.640 --> 27:54.468
Second thoughts, what do
you mean second thought?

27:54.470 --> 27:55.608
Anyway, you were gonna give me the address

27:55.610 --> 27:57.660
of the wedding venue, I've got a pen now.

28:00.550 --> 28:02.200
What do you mean second thoughts?

28:05.090 --> 28:06.393
She said so?

28:07.640 --> 28:09.198
What, that you shouldn't
give me the address?

28:09.200 --> 28:10.668
Robert, this is for Martha.

28:10.670 --> 28:13.023
I won't attend, you haven't invited me.

28:14.410 --> 28:17.098
No, I know that you haven't
exactly invited her either,

28:17.100 --> 28:19.203
but she really wants to come.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.711
Well, you'll have to ignore her worries.

28:23.713 --> 28:26.068
Yeah, just ignore Yolanda's worries.

28:26.070 --> 28:27.570
To be frank, she just needs...

28:30.130 --> 28:32.478
You're right, I'm sorry,
please don't get angry,

28:32.480 --> 28:33.880
just finding this difficult.

28:37.700 --> 28:40.250
I understand, I know she's
your wife-to-be, I know.

28:42.208 --> 28:43.747
I know you love her, but...

28:47.927 --> 28:49.823
You said that you loved me.

28:52.170 --> 28:54.128
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm fine, honestly.

28:54.130 --> 28:55.933
Sorry, I'm just emotional.

28:56.400 --> 28:58.340
Please don't end the call, please, Robert!

29:26.677 --> 29:27.563
"I love her.

29:32.576 --> 29:36.326
"She's my wife-to-be
and we're having a baby.

29:36.976 --> 29:38.726
"You and I are over."

30:45.506 --> 30:46.339
Martha!

30:46.938 --> 30:49.153
Martha, Martha, he's having a baby.

30:50.100 --> 30:51.408
Robert, with her, with that woman,

30:51.410 --> 30:52.938
he's having a baby with her!

30:52.940 --> 30:53.948
He just told me on the phone.

30:53.950 --> 30:55.787
He said, "We're having a baby."

30:58.860 --> 30:59.963
I'm calm!

31:02.130 --> 31:04.130
What do you mean you don't think she is?

31:06.247 --> 31:08.647
I need to make sure I've
heard him right because

31:11.200 --> 31:13.093
maybe that's why he left me.

31:15.430 --> 31:19.653
He made me have that terrible abortion,

31:20.100 --> 31:22.888
and now I might not be able to have kids!

31:22.890 --> 31:24.857
Is that why he's chosen her?

31:36.860 --> 31:38.213
You're right.

31:40.680 --> 31:43.743
You're right, cool, cool,
cool, cool head, calm, calm.

31:44.100 --> 31:44.933
Cool head.

31:45.300 --> 31:46.133
Okay,

31:48.900 --> 31:49.800
I'll let you know.

32:09.270 --> 32:10.750
Robert, call me, please.

32:30.099 --> 32:31.815
I've done it, I've done the third one.

32:31.817 --> 32:33.004
It's still positive, I'm sorry.

32:33.839 --> 32:34.724
No, I'm still holding your baby.

32:34.726 --> 32:37.494
I'm sorry to be the bearer
of such bad fucking news!

32:39.839 --> 32:41.773
I never even asked to have a baby.

32:41.775 --> 32:42.899
Well, it happened!

33:15.290 --> 33:16.143
Hi, Martha.

33:18.230 --> 33:21.123
I think I'm going mad.

33:23.721 --> 33:25.418
You'll never believe what
he's just said to me.

33:25.420 --> 33:28.253
He just told me that
they're havin' a baby, yeah.

33:31.860 --> 33:33.293
When did I tell you that?

33:40.452 --> 33:42.452
I actually am going mad.

33:49.540 --> 33:50.371
Can you come over?

33:50.373 --> 33:51.723
Actually, no, don't.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.358
I'm sending him an email.

33:55.360 --> 33:57.978
He needs to be reminded of
everything that's happened,

33:57.980 --> 34:01.178
'cause I don't understand what he's doing.

34:01.180 --> 34:03.280
I don't understand, I don't get it either.

34:07.940 --> 34:10.068
I've written an email,
can I send it to you?

34:10.070 --> 34:12.110
Can you read it

34:13.989 --> 34:16.447
and then rewrite it as you see fit,

34:16.449 --> 34:18.523
and then send it to him?

34:19.540 --> 34:21.158
Someone with a clearer head,

34:21.159 --> 34:24.507
and it'll come better from you
because you've witnessed it

34:24.510 --> 34:26.860
and you're my friend,
and you know our history.

34:29.699 --> 34:30.533
Thank you.

34:31.139 --> 34:31.973
Hold on.

34:35.018 --> 34:36.217
Okay, I've just sent it.

34:38.161 --> 34:38.995
Okay.

34:39.659 --> 34:41.360
All right, thank you, let me know.

36:28.619 --> 36:30.348
Pick up your phone.

36:30.350 --> 36:33.413
Pick up your phone now and hear my voice!

36:33.940 --> 36:36.590
You said that if I loved
you, I shouldn't be selfish!

36:36.818 --> 36:38.649
You said our relationship wouldn't survive

36:38.651 --> 36:40.484
if I would be selfish!

36:41.281 --> 36:44.531
You made me have that fuckin' abortion!

36:45.318 --> 36:48.100
And now I might not be able to have kids,

36:48.102 --> 36:52.685
and I did it for you 'cause
you said you weren't ready!

36:53.273 --> 36:54.106
And now,

36:55.542 --> 36:59.375
and now I might not even
be able to have kids!

39:42.098 --> 39:43.593
Hello, Robert.

39:46.010 --> 39:46.883
Yeah, I'm here.

39:48.330 --> 39:49.453
Yeah, I can hear you.

39:51.670 --> 39:53.713
Yes, yeah, I got them.

39:55.649 --> 39:58.013
But you know what, I don't
have to answer to you.

39:58.900 --> 40:01.823
Ho, ho, you want to talk now!

40:02.310 --> 40:03.185
What's there to talk about?

40:03.187 --> 40:05.238
Are you gettin' married tomorrow?

40:05.240 --> 40:07.153
Then there's nothing to talk about!

41:24.750 --> 41:26.253
Hi, Robert it's me.

41:27.940 --> 41:30.318
Yeah, I'm fine, I was
thinking about what you said.

41:30.320 --> 41:32.818
You're right, you know,
maybe we should talk.

41:32.820 --> 41:34.778
We've got so many friends
in common, it'd be good.

41:34.780 --> 41:36.203
Let's leave it nicely.

41:38.990 --> 41:40.023
Yeah, come over.

41:43.588 --> 41:44.419
Yeah, I'll be here all day.

41:44.421 --> 41:46.408
I can't really hear
you, you're breakin' up.

41:46.410 --> 41:47.683
I'll be here all day.

41:51.550 --> 41:52.383
Yeah.

42:21.730 --> 42:26.588
Robert, what was the
point of fighting a storm?

42:26.590 --> 42:28.373
It must pass,

42:30.586 --> 42:33.263
because it's come.

42:34.260 --> 42:37.361
So I give in to my inevitable
fate, and it will pass too.

42:40.590 --> 42:43.148
What will be left of my
fate is up to the scavengers

42:43.150 --> 42:46.293
of what was hope, to feed on,

42:46.810 --> 42:49.743
because my hope did not become my fate.

42:50.270 --> 42:54.048
My fate gave me no chance to
run, to escape, to survive,

42:54.050 --> 42:56.093
to achieve my hope, to win.

42:57.180 --> 42:59.530
In that long fight between
my fate and my hope,

43:00.130 --> 43:01.783
my fate has won.

43:02.778 --> 43:04.248
I fought for your love, Robert,

43:04.250 --> 43:07.107
your affection, your attention.

43:10.448 --> 43:11.281
Hi, Dad.

43:12.250 --> 43:13.083
Good.

43:14.050 --> 43:15.323
No, Robert's not here.

43:17.440 --> 43:19.390
No, I don't think Robert's coming back.

43:21.010 --> 43:22.053
Is Mum there?

43:25.973 --> 43:29.168
Okay, while you're on the phone, listen,

43:29.170 --> 43:33.533
your gun, your hunting gun,

43:34.090 --> 43:37.040
do you think I could borrow it
for a little trip I'm doing?

43:40.070 --> 43:40.903
Yeah.

43:44.070 --> 43:44.903
Yeah.

43:46.424 --> 43:48.833
Okay, I'll find another trip.

43:50.460 --> 43:51.823
Be strong, got it.

43:53.617 --> 43:55.970
Plenty more fish in the sea, got it.

43:59.785 --> 44:00.618
Huh?

44:03.210 --> 44:05.263
I've just got tot stop the fire alarm.

44:06.180 --> 44:09.668
I dared to believe in love
of a woman for her man.

44:09.670 --> 44:10.628
I'll speak to you soon.

44:10.630 --> 44:12.098
What she thought was her man.

44:12.100 --> 44:12.931
Bye, bye.

44:12.933 --> 44:15.810
I dared to believe in something
that I've never seen before,

44:16.610 --> 44:18.908
something I gave but never received

44:18.910 --> 44:20.168
without seeing or receiving.

44:20.170 --> 44:22.240
I gave you my love, Robert,

44:22.647 --> 44:25.153
but you sent me a storm in return.

44:26.375 --> 44:27.525
You smashed everything.

44:28.640 --> 44:30.060
When you read this, Robert,

44:30.610 --> 44:33.888
just know that I confronted
my fate with bravery,

44:33.890 --> 44:37.258
that I went bravely with
the storm you sent my way

44:37.260 --> 44:40.730
in return for the love
I sent yours, Robert.

44:42.845 --> 44:44.194
There is nothing to live for.

45:08.010 --> 45:08.843
Hi, Robby.

45:11.970 --> 45:14.173
Oh, please, no.

45:15.830 --> 45:17.728
Sorry, no.

45:17.730 --> 45:18.693
No fire.

45:20.180 --> 45:23.228
The parents, of course,
and the neighbors, yeah.

45:23.230 --> 45:24.977
No, I understand, thank you.

45:25.670 --> 45:27.463
No, it's just an accident.

45:27.970 --> 45:31.243
Yeah, yep, just going to bed, thank you.

45:32.220 --> 45:33.403
Thank you, goodnight.

45:53.420 --> 45:54.253
Hi, Dad.

45:56.600 --> 45:57.433
Yeah.

45:58.020 --> 45:59.173
No, I understand.

46:00.850 --> 46:02.363
I'm coping really well.

46:04.570 --> 46:07.023
I'll come by as soon as
I get a chance, okay?

46:09.630 --> 46:10.483
Say that again.

46:16.300 --> 46:17.133
Bye.

46:22.550 --> 46:25.597
Don't be a victim, let others be a victim.

46:26.240 --> 46:27.683
Be the last one standing.

46:30.020 --> 46:34.340
Let others be the victim,
always be the last one

46:36.030 --> 46:36.863
standing.

46:46.790 --> 46:49.993
You're the victim, not me.

46:51.490 --> 46:55.733
I'll spit on your body.

47:29.752 --> 47:30.669
Hi, Robert.

47:33.000 --> 47:33.873
Yeah.

47:34.860 --> 47:35.693
Good.

47:37.502 --> 47:39.398
Do you still want to come
over and have that talk?

47:39.400 --> 47:41.293
Just, you know, come over now.

47:41.680 --> 47:42.758
What does Mike call it?

47:42.760 --> 47:44.893
Booty call.

47:45.952 --> 47:46.785
Oh, you heard him.

47:47.490 --> 47:48.323
Yeah.

47:48.980 --> 47:52.178
You know, I think you should
probably come and get him.

47:52.180 --> 47:54.158
Yeah, come and get him, I
actually don't want him.

47:54.160 --> 47:56.548
If not, I'll just take
him down to Battersea.

47:56.550 --> 48:00.380
You forget that you met that woman

48:00.660 --> 48:03.923
when you took our dog
to mate with her bitch.

48:05.090 --> 48:07.113
What, gloves, what?

48:09.070 --> 48:11.670
Fur-lined gloves, I don't
know, I haven't seen them.

48:12.430 --> 48:13.613
I'll have a look.

48:15.220 --> 48:16.320
They're possibly here.

48:25.220 --> 48:27.283
No, I can't find them anywhere.

48:27.820 --> 48:28.938
I've had a look everywhere,

48:28.940 --> 48:31.113
I've had a look in the chest of drawers.

48:32.810 --> 48:35.023
I'm in the wardrobe and I can't find them.

48:41.540 --> 48:43.323
Okay, let me have another look.

49:08.066 --> 49:08.897
Found them.

49:08.899 --> 49:11.078
I'm gonna put 'em with
the letters in a bag

49:11.080 --> 49:13.180
and you can get them when you come 'round.

49:15.810 --> 49:19.077
Yeah, you should keep them,
they're in good condition.

49:22.370 --> 49:23.913
Yeah, the dog,

49:25.100 --> 49:27.243
oh, the dog's in great condition.

49:27.760 --> 49:30.668
The dog will be in the same
condition as the gloves

49:30.670 --> 49:32.598
when you get here.

49:32.600 --> 49:34.073
All right, bye.

49:58.236 --> 49:59.136
No, this won't do!

50:09.127 --> 50:10.904
That's your lot, Robby!

50:36.213 --> 50:37.858
Hello?

50:37.860 --> 50:40.493
Electoral register, no, thank you!

51:00.830 --> 51:01.663
Hello, Robert.

51:04.400 --> 51:05.233
What?

51:07.230 --> 51:09.148
No, no, no, no, don't send Michael,

51:09.150 --> 51:10.378
you have to come yourself.

51:10.380 --> 51:11.728
I've been waiting for you.

51:11.730 --> 51:12.738
I've got everything ready for you.

51:12.740 --> 51:14.090
I've got your letters here.

51:16.550 --> 51:17.598
No, I haven't opened any of them.

51:17.600 --> 51:19.300
I promised you I wouldn't do that.

51:20.060 --> 51:20.893
No!

51:23.780 --> 51:24.613
What?

51:25.650 --> 51:28.110
I can't really hear what you're...

51:30.393 --> 51:32.133
Did you say reconciliation?

51:33.820 --> 51:34.908
Did you just say reconciliation?

51:34.910 --> 51:36.428
Between who and who?

51:36.430 --> 51:37.263
When? What?

51:37.590 --> 51:39.640
Robert, I can't really hear you, not now!

51:40.565 --> 51:41.398
Hello?

51:42.903 --> 51:44.608
Robert, Robert, I can't really hear you.

51:44.610 --> 51:47.139
You sound all weird again,
like you're underwater.

51:47.141 --> 51:48.013
I can't really hear you,

51:48.015 --> 51:49.888
but we can sort everything out, please.

51:49.890 --> 51:52.933
Robert, how can you reconcile with someone

51:52.935 --> 51:54.632
when you can't hear each other?

51:54.634 --> 51:55.551
God's sake!

52:04.602 --> 52:07.685
Martha, Martha, call me back, please.

52:19.755 --> 52:20.588
Oh, God.

52:30.690 --> 52:32.598
Martha, he's talking about reconciliation.

52:32.600 --> 52:34.603
He is, I just spoke to him, Robert!

52:35.540 --> 52:36.843
I just had to tell you.

52:39.057 --> 52:40.108
I don't know what to do with myself.

52:40.110 --> 52:43.328
I feel so awful, I was planning to,

52:43.330 --> 52:44.478
what do you mean he's not?

52:44.480 --> 52:45.568
Don't be so pessimistic!

52:45.570 --> 52:46.928
No, the line got cut off

52:46.930 --> 52:49.380
'cause the reception has
been really, really bad.

52:50.030 --> 52:51.580
Oh, my God, it's him, it's him!

52:53.170 --> 52:54.003
Robert?

52:54.720 --> 52:57.468
No, no, no, please,
please, don't apologize.

52:57.470 --> 52:59.858
You've got nothing to be sorry
for, that's unfair on you.

52:59.860 --> 53:01.058
You've been nothing but a gentleman.

53:01.060 --> 53:02.958
You've been noble, really noble.

53:02.960 --> 53:05.118
You gave me every chance.

53:05.120 --> 53:06.388
It's just we had so many obstacles

53:06.390 --> 53:07.768
in the way of our relationship together,

53:07.770 --> 53:10.663
but those obstacles,
we've ridden them out now!

53:10.913 --> 53:13.383
Where are you now, are you driving now?

53:16.006 --> 53:20.060
God, I'm talking to myself.

53:24.390 --> 53:26.040
Hi, Robert, it's only me, it's D.

53:26.480 --> 53:28.608
Yeah, how funny, I was just
chatting away to myself,

53:28.610 --> 53:30.763
didn't even realize that
the line had gone dead.

53:31.750 --> 53:32.878
Anyway, you must be driving now,

53:32.880 --> 53:35.088
so I'm gonna order us some food.

53:35.090 --> 53:36.648
I'm gonna order your seafood combo,

53:36.650 --> 53:37.698
I know it's your favorite,

53:37.700 --> 53:39.813
and it will be ready and
warm for when you get here.

53:40.190 --> 53:42.027
Okay, bye, bye, bye.

53:54.230 --> 53:55.566
Go wash yourself, woman.

54:34.139 --> 54:35.306
How are you?

54:36.489 --> 54:37.322
Come in.

54:44.120 --> 54:45.037
Missed you.

55:29.550 --> 55:30.963
Hi, Robert, it's me.

55:32.537 --> 55:34.608
I'm just phoning to see where you are.

55:34.610 --> 55:38.963
I've been waiting for you,
and I'm so excited to see you.

55:40.020 --> 55:41.638
Maybe give me a call
back when you get this.

55:41.640 --> 55:42.938
Actually, no, do you know what?

55:42.940 --> 55:44.578
I'm gonna call you on the landline.

55:44.580 --> 55:47.080
Ignore me, I'm gonna call
you on the landline now.

55:54.250 --> 55:55.083
Hello?

55:55.570 --> 55:56.670
Hi, Mike, is that you?

55:57.480 --> 55:59.230
Hallelujah, you pick up your phone!

55:59.690 --> 56:00.521
I've been calling for days,

56:00.523 --> 56:02.170
no one ever picks up the landline!

56:02.930 --> 56:03.903
Yeah, how are you?

56:05.040 --> 56:06.073
I'm great.

56:06.270 --> 56:08.828
Listen, I just wanna be
quick, I'm waiting for Robert.

56:08.830 --> 56:10.418
I was just speaking to
him on the phone just now,

56:10.420 --> 56:12.023
and then we got cut off.

56:14.990 --> 56:15.823
Oh.

56:16.490 --> 56:18.208
Oh, that's fine, he must
have already left then.

56:18.210 --> 56:20.038
He must be driving on his way here now.

56:20.040 --> 56:21.760
We've been talking, so...

56:26.330 --> 56:28.650
Sorry, what do you mean he's not

56:29.010 --> 56:30.760
gonna be in London for a few day...

56:38.020 --> 56:38.853
Really?

56:39.520 --> 56:40.470
When did he travel?

56:45.714 --> 56:46.663
Course.

56:47.940 --> 56:50.638
Silly me, that's why the
phone line's been so bad

56:50.640 --> 56:51.913
and why he got cut off.

56:53.200 --> 56:54.513
Where exactly is he?

57:10.850 --> 57:11.683
Okay.

57:13.140 --> 57:13.973
Bye.

58:11.671 --> 58:13.403
Stop.

58:13.960 --> 58:16.488
Just stop talking, Robert!

58:16.490 --> 58:17.453
Where are you?

58:20.030 --> 58:20.861
Where are you?

58:20.863 --> 58:23.583
In fact, you don't even need
to tell me because I know!

58:23.810 --> 58:26.058
How were you gonna come here tonight?

58:26.060 --> 58:29.750
How can you come from Tunis to our home

58:29.960 --> 58:33.638
here in London tonight
for our reconciliation,

58:33.640 --> 58:36.223
and to pick up your letters and your dog?

58:39.633 --> 58:41.883
How were you gonna do that?

58:44.914 --> 58:45.747
I'm not.

58:47.602 --> 58:48.433
What are you talking about?

58:48.435 --> 58:53.435
I'm not making anything up.

58:54.333 --> 58:55.164
What are you talking about?

58:55.166 --> 58:56.861
You just said a while ago that
you would come here tonight

58:56.863 --> 59:01.613
for the reconciliation and
get your dog and your letters!

59:03.533 --> 59:04.958
I just don't understand,
I don't understand.

59:04.960 --> 59:06.860
I'm not making anything up, I haven't,

59:07.370 --> 59:10.070
yes, your letters, you keep
saying about your letters!

59:11.070 --> 59:11.913
Which one?

59:12.823 --> 59:15.173
What post, what post, when, what?

59:18.794 --> 59:20.377
Oh, the reconcil...

59:27.538 --> 59:31.623
reconciliation account
statement for your mortgage.

59:42.517 --> 59:43.817
Is that the reconciliation

59:45.030 --> 59:46.858
you were talking about the whole time?

59:46.860 --> 59:47.693
No.

59:50.416 --> 59:51.249
Not reconciliation with me, no.

59:53.826 --> 59:54.676
I feel so stupid.

01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:30.413
I'm still here.

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:37.813
So how is Tunis?

01:00:38.637 --> 01:00:40.187
Is she there with you now, hmm?

01:00:42.830 --> 01:00:44.030
Well, where is she then?

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:48.820
I know she's from there, or her mother is.

01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:50.171
Yeah, I've been, haven't I?

01:00:50.173 --> 01:00:51.638
Martha's got relations
there, do you remember?

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:52.790
I've been there before.

01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:58.123
So is the wedding not
tomorrow then if she's not,

01:00:59.770 --> 01:01:00.973
she flies in today.

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:03.483
That's nice.

01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:08.520
And where, chapel airport.

01:01:11.410 --> 01:01:12.243
Lovely.

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:15.133
Let me just get this straight in my head.

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:18.823
You've been in Tunis this entire time,

01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:26.240
whilst arranging to come
here and to keep me away.

01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:29.748
So when are you gonna come and get

01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:32.928
your reconciliation account statement,

01:01:32.930 --> 01:01:34.888
and your letters, and your dog?

01:01:34.890 --> 01:01:36.233
I can't post your dog.

01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:38.220
You know, I've gotta go now.

01:01:43.701 --> 01:01:44.534
Again.

01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:47.561
Who will be the last one standing?

01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:08.883
Hi, Michael.

01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:10.823
I'm sorry to keep bothering you.

01:02:13.178 --> 01:02:14.243
I just had a thought.

01:02:15.070 --> 01:02:17.973
Since Robert is marrying Yolanda,

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:22.373
maybe you and I might like
to have dinner some time?

01:02:25.754 --> 01:02:28.158
Aw, I know you always cared about me.

01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:30.818
I've always felt really close to you too,

01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:32.870
but you know, it was just awkward before.

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:37.753
I wasn't free to, well, I am now.

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:43.838
Since you're on the phone,
you don't happen to know

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:46.090
the name of the hotel
where Robert's staying?

01:02:49.456 --> 01:02:51.063
And how do you spell?

01:02:54.810 --> 01:02:55.643
Great.

01:02:59.950 --> 01:03:00.783
Okay.

01:03:02.530 --> 01:03:04.403
Tomorrow, eight o'clock?

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:07.863
The Zikora Bar, Chase Road?

01:03:09.050 --> 01:03:10.053
Perfect.

01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:11.918
Bye.

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:12.753
Hello?

01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:14.503
Hello.

01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:20.618
I don't speak Arabic.

01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:24.803
I need to report a man staying
in Hotel Zaza in Tunis.

01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:28.198
No, I'm English, English language.

01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:29.993
I need to report a man.

01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:34.453
His name is Robert Savage,

01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:38.133
and he's going to marry
a woman called Yolanda.

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:42.527
She's flying in tonight on
a Tunisian air flight AJ98

01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:46.263
at 10:15 p.m.

01:03:46.610 --> 01:03:49.223
Well, she is a drug courier.

01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:52.848
Yes, you need to arrest her.

01:03:52.850 --> 01:03:53.681
Hello?

01:03:53.683 --> 01:03:55.668
You need to arrest the
woman and not let her in.

01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:57.508
I don't speak any Arabic.

01:03:57.510 --> 01:04:00.198
He doesn't know that she's
carrying drugs, he's innocent.

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:03.600
You need to send him back to London

01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:06.053
and arrest the woman.

01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:09.130
Put her in jail

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:10.793
forever.

01:04:14.890 --> 01:04:15.723
Yes.

01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:19.053
Okay.

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:45.173
Hi, Martha, it's me.

01:04:46.490 --> 01:04:49.153
I need you to call me as
soon as you get this message.

01:04:49.882 --> 01:04:53.347
I think I've...

01:04:54.130 --> 01:04:54.963
Hello?

01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:56.533
Robert, Robert!

01:05:00.370 --> 01:05:01.203
Why?

01:05:02.550 --> 01:05:03.900
Why have they arrested you?

01:05:05.586 --> 01:05:07.040
An alibi, for what?

01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:12.883
Okay, okay.

01:05:14.370 --> 01:05:16.718
Yeah, okay, surety for bail, sure.

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:17.823
No problem, how much?

01:05:20.021 --> 01:05:21.173
250 grand?

01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:25.563
I don't really know what to do.

01:05:27.350 --> 01:05:28.183
Yeah.

01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:29.870
Character witness, yeah.

01:05:31.141 --> 01:05:33.710
Oh, Robert, what have I done?

01:05:33.712 --> 01:05:38.562
I'm so sorry!

01:05:40.181 --> 01:05:41.014
I'm sorry.

01:05:42.443 --> 01:05:43.610
I just, I'm...

01:05:45.717 --> 01:05:47.238
But it doesn't make sense!

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:49.490
You've not done anything
wrong, you have a...

01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:53.983
Cannabis?

01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:57.827
They found cannabis on you?

01:05:59.350 --> 01:06:01.063
Robert, what were you thinking?

01:06:01.461 --> 01:06:04.547
Why on earth would you
have, you should have known!

01:06:05.250 --> 01:06:08.573
12 years in prison for cannabis?

01:06:14.392 --> 01:06:16.309
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:06:19.090 --> 01:06:23.900
Okay, I'll speak to my parents
and sort out the surety

01:06:24.430 --> 01:06:25.608
for the bail.

01:06:25.610 --> 01:06:28.503
They have holiday homes, one
in Florida, one in Spain.

01:06:29.690 --> 01:06:31.640
You want me to fly out and be with you?

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:33.786
What about Yolanda?

01:06:36.127 --> 01:06:36.960
Martha?

01:06:41.290 --> 01:06:42.293
British police.

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:44.973
So she was arrested?

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:47.693
So she's not on her way to Tunis?

01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:49.313
Are you sure?

01:06:50.790 --> 01:06:51.653
Wow.

01:06:53.650 --> 01:06:56.508
Okay, I'll get my parents to
do the surety for the bail,

01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:58.498
and flight sorted now,
and I'll be with you

01:06:58.500 --> 01:06:59.533
as soon as I can.

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:03.710
Oh, so I can't call
you on your mobile now?

01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:08.513
Right, okay, Central Tunis Police Station.

01:07:09.050 --> 01:07:09.883
Okay.

01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:11.688
Hello?

01:07:11.690 --> 01:07:14.248
Oh, oh, no, sorry,
Officer, I hadn't finished.

01:07:14.250 --> 01:07:15.478
I was still speaking to Robert.

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:16.530
Can you put him back?

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:34.233
Hello, Martha?

01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:36.023
Hi.

01:07:36.610 --> 01:07:39.568
Yeah, I'm a bit panicky, I don't
really know what I've done.

01:07:39.570 --> 01:07:41.120
I don't really know what to do.

01:07:42.560 --> 01:07:43.393
Where are you?

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:45.757
What, where?

01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:47.383
As in the airport?

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:48.793
Oh!

01:07:49.770 --> 01:07:51.568
Yeah, I didn't know
that you were traveling.

01:07:51.570 --> 01:07:52.403
Where are you?

01:07:54.952 --> 01:07:56.911
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a minute.

01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:05.998
You were arrested in Stansted Airport

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.050
as you waited for your flight to Tunisia.

01:08:12.250 --> 01:08:14.883
Martha, what were you arrested for?

01:08:17.965 --> 01:08:18.798
A tip off?

01:08:21.524 --> 01:08:22.822
Possession of drugs?

01:08:26.670 --> 01:08:27.502
Martha,

01:08:29.456 --> 01:08:30.622
are you Yolanda?

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:33.943
Martha?

01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:37.252
Are you Yolanda?

01:08:46.062 --> 01:08:50.250
