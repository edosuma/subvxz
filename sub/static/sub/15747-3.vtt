WEBVTT

00:01.135 --> 00:03.235
-<i> Previously on</i> The Strain...

00:05.773 --> 00:07.539
- Mama? Mama, it's OK.

00:07.541 --> 00:09.775
I just want to give you this.
Look. Alright? Here.

00:11.812 --> 00:13.545
I will get them back
for what they did to us.

00:13.547 --> 00:16.982
(growling)
- This book, it is bait!

00:16.984 --> 00:20.319
You want the Master? He will
come for whoever possesses it.

00:20.321 --> 00:23.822
- We want the<i> Lumen.</i>
You have a choice to make.

00:23.824 --> 00:27.026
The<i> Lumen</i> or Zack.

00:27.028 --> 00:28.861
(slurping)

00:28.863 --> 00:30.195
Mom?

00:35.036 --> 00:38.103
(Zack wheezing)

00:46.147 --> 00:48.347
- What did the Master
offer you for it?

00:48.349 --> 00:50.482
- My son.
- The<i> Lumen</i> will bring

00:50.484 --> 00:55.220
the Master out of hiding. When
he comes for it, I'll kill him.

00:55.222 --> 00:57.256
- How do I know you can
get the job done?

00:57.258 --> 01:00.259
- I've been preparing
for this "job"

01:00.261 --> 01:02.561
for over 1000 years.

01:06.901 --> 01:10.035
- Alright, baby, you're doing
great. Just breathe deeply.

01:10.037 --> 01:13.238
In... out.

01:13.240 --> 01:16.375
- Enough with the breathing.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

01:16.377 --> 01:18.510
OK. Sounds good.

01:18.512 --> 01:19.578
- Look, Dr. Somani...

01:19.580 --> 01:20.846
- Dr. Somani?

01:20.848 --> 01:23.415
- Hi. So we are all set here.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.584
Many, many first
deliveries are long labors.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.786
- I wanted to do this naturally.
- The fetus could

01:27.788 --> 01:30.589
go into distress.
We've reached the time now

01:30.591 --> 01:32.624
where this is the right
thing for everyone. Yeah?

01:32.626 --> 01:35.727
So just lie back, try to relax,
and this'll be over quickly.

01:35.729 --> 01:37.162
Okay.

01:37.163 --> 01:38.596
- Isn't that what I said the
night we got into this mess?

01:40.434 --> 01:43.802
- Here we go, OK?

01:43.804 --> 01:47.406
- I just wanted it
to be perfect.

01:47.408 --> 01:49.875
- It IS perfect. You're being
too hard on yourself.

01:52.279 --> 01:53.745
- Suction, please?
(squelching)

01:53.747 --> 01:55.747
Thank you. There we go.

01:55.749 --> 01:58.317
Get those hands in there. Yep.

01:58.319 --> 01:59.818
(gasping)

01:59.820 --> 02:01.220
Oh!

02:01.222 --> 02:05.257
- What is it? Eph?
Is it a boy? A girl?

02:05.259 --> 02:06.992
- What do we do?

02:06.994 --> 02:08.560
- Eph? What is it?

02:14.301 --> 02:16.668
- Hand under there, please.
- What is it?

02:16.670 --> 02:19.271
What's wrong with my baby?
- It's within the caul.

02:19.273 --> 02:20.672
Okay.

02:20.674 --> 02:22.407
But everything's fine.
Right, Dr. Somani?

02:22.409 --> 02:24.409
- Of course, it's just--
it's incredible.

02:24.411 --> 02:27.012
- Get it out!
Get my baby out of there!

02:27.014 --> 02:29.581
- Scalpel.
- Scalpel.

02:29.583 --> 02:33.018
- Careful now. Gently,
gently. Alright.

02:33.020 --> 02:35.687
Alert the PICU.
We might need them. Steady.

02:35.689 --> 02:38.690
Steady. Get that head out.

02:38.692 --> 02:41.693
Hand under there, please.
(baby crying)

02:41.695 --> 02:44.029
- Everything's fine.

02:44.031 --> 02:47.132
- Alright. It'll be OK.

02:47.134 --> 02:49.134
Beautiful baby boy.
- Well done.

02:49.136 --> 02:52.437
(baby crying)

02:55.209 --> 02:59.444
- It was a great omen, Zack.

02:59.446 --> 03:02.014
A caul baby is very rare.

03:02.016 --> 03:05.717
You were delivered from my body
but still part of me.

03:05.719 --> 03:07.786
- What do you mean?

03:09.723 --> 03:12.658
- We have a bond
no one can break.

03:12.660 --> 03:16.228
- Even with you like this?

03:18.566 --> 03:20.799
- I'm sorry you
saw me feeding, Zack.

03:20.801 --> 03:24.169
I know it was a shock.

03:24.171 --> 03:26.405
- He was a boy.

03:26.407 --> 03:28.407
- I know.

03:28.409 --> 03:31.577
But he was suffering
in his old life.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.615
It's like you.
You're feeling better.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.786
How is your breathing?

03:43.724 --> 03:44.890
- Better.

03:46.727 --> 03:50.062
Really good, actually.

03:50.064 --> 03:52.264
What did he give me?

03:52.266 --> 03:56.335
- A tiny droplet of what
makes the Master special.

03:56.337 --> 04:00.272
- So does it mean
that I'm going to turn?

04:03.110 --> 04:05.777
- The Master has seen this world
through the centuries, Zack.

04:05.779 --> 04:09.014
War. Strife. Starvation.

04:09.016 --> 04:12.284
He wants to end all that.

04:12.286 --> 04:16.121
And you can help him.

04:16.123 --> 04:19.124
- Yeah, but help him how?

04:19.126 --> 04:21.426
- He will show you
when you are ready.

04:21.428 --> 04:25.330
I always knew you were
destined for great things.

04:34.475 --> 04:37.442
(creaking)

04:45.152 --> 04:48.387
(theme music)

05:44.278 --> 05:46.378
- (Setrakian): Hey!

05:46.380 --> 05:48.447
Mr. Fet!

05:52.353 --> 05:54.553
It's gone.
- Gone?

05:54.555 --> 05:56.855
- My book. The<i> Lumen!</i>

06:02.129 --> 06:05.897
- I warned you. A half
<i> strigoi</i> is still a<i> strigoi.</i>

06:05.899 --> 06:09.067
- The Born. He took it?

06:09.069 --> 06:11.737
- Could be handing it over
to the Ancients right now.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.839
Or even worse,
the Master himself.

06:13.841 --> 06:17.976
- We must get it back!
- Can't see any way to do that.

06:17.978 --> 06:21.747
Unless someone who never
trusted the Born to begin with

06:21.749 --> 06:23.749
slipped a tiny
GPS tracking device,

06:23.751 --> 06:25.751
like the ones used
to track wild animals,

06:25.753 --> 06:28.553
into the book's silver binding
where no sticky-fingered muncher

06:28.555 --> 06:30.756
or half-muncher
could ever find it.

06:30.758 --> 06:33.091
- Is that true?

06:33.093 --> 06:35.093
- Who's your favorite
exterminator?

06:35.095 --> 06:37.028
- And in the name
of all that's holy,

06:37.030 --> 06:39.097
let's go get the son of a bitch.

06:42.770 --> 06:44.836
(intense music)

06:46.740 --> 06:48.807
(distant men yelling)

06:51.512 --> 06:53.612
(footsteps)

06:53.614 --> 06:56.481
- Still agonizing?

06:58.619 --> 07:02.354
- Am I a fool?
- Well, you're human.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.924
- It's a book.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.058
Bound in silver,

07:07.060 --> 07:09.795
full of myth

07:09.797 --> 07:12.631
and folklore about<i> strigoi</i>
throughout recorded history.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.966
I... It's just
a book. I know that.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.201
- Yes.

07:16.203 --> 07:17.702
- If the Master
wants it that bad

07:17.704 --> 07:19.871
it must have some value to him.

07:19.873 --> 07:22.707
- Or he believes it does.

07:22.709 --> 07:24.810
- Exactly.

07:24.812 --> 07:27.612
Am I trading the future
of human life on Earth

07:27.614 --> 07:29.881
for the soul of my boy?

07:29.883 --> 07:32.317
- A parent's love for his or her
offspring is one of the prime

07:32.319 --> 07:34.920
movers of human experience.
- Or so you've been told.

07:34.922 --> 07:37.656
- Professor Setrakian
informs me that your wife

07:37.658 --> 07:40.592
is one of the Master's
principal servants.

07:40.594 --> 07:43.595
- What about it?
- I believe

07:43.597 --> 07:46.932
there are other elemental
human emotions at play here

07:46.934 --> 07:51.069
as well as a parent's love,
such as hatred and revenge.

07:52.606 --> 07:54.005
Don't shy away from the truth

07:54.007 --> 07:56.408
of what motivates you, Doctor.

08:00.514 --> 08:02.714
That book is the answer
to both our problems.

08:04.184 --> 08:07.352
You will get your son back.

08:07.354 --> 08:08.720
And I will kill my father.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.531
(hubbub)

08:24.338 --> 08:27.539
(laughing)
- Oh, you're right!

08:29.109 --> 08:31.109
- (man): Step up and see
the demon child...

08:31.111 --> 08:32.477
the two-headed boy!

08:32.479 --> 08:34.579
(laughing and
overlapping voices)

08:37.050 --> 08:39.651
Are you afraid?

08:39.653 --> 08:43.054
(music playing)

08:43.056 --> 08:45.123
- ..the horse I gave you.
- Oh, yes.

08:47.728 --> 08:50.395
(overlapping voices)

08:50.397 --> 08:54.099
Gaze upon unknown
and mysterious creatures.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.904
- Behold the Leech.

09:01.308 --> 09:04.709
(snarling)
(crowd murmuring)

09:04.711 --> 09:06.711
It is a mute. The only thing

09:06.713 --> 09:09.214
this accursed being
understands is a whipping.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.550
(growling)

09:12.519 --> 09:13.919
I wouldn't get too close.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.489
- I want to watch him feed.

09:20.527 --> 09:24.596
(low growling)
(goat bleating)

09:24.598 --> 09:27.098
I am Ancharia.

09:27.100 --> 09:30.402
I have been searching
for you for a long time.

09:30.404 --> 09:32.737
(clanging)

09:32.739 --> 09:36.074
(growling)
(metal creaking)

09:36.076 --> 09:38.944
(bleating)

09:43.450 --> 09:46.585
It's alright.

09:46.587 --> 09:49.454
(bleating)

09:49.456 --> 09:51.790
(screeching)

09:55.295 --> 09:58.430
You are not unholy.
You are blessed.

09:58.432 --> 10:01.967
You are a prince
born of a dark being.

10:05.906 --> 10:09.441
- But I must enquire, for what
purpose do you desire to possess

10:09.443 --> 10:11.376
this abomination?

10:11.378 --> 10:13.545
- The truth,
if you must know it,

10:13.547 --> 10:15.880
is that this being
you call a "leech,"

10:15.882 --> 10:18.817
and whom you have caged
and whipped like a cur,

10:18.819 --> 10:21.119
is a hybrid creature.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.888
Half-human, yes.

10:23.890 --> 10:26.658
And half-strix.

10:28.929 --> 10:31.162
- A strix?

10:31.164 --> 10:35.066
But he does not resemble a strix
as I have seen them drawn.

10:35.068 --> 10:37.669
They have black hair
and curved fangs.

10:41.675 --> 10:44.142
Oh, by Orcus's sword,
what have I done?

10:44.144 --> 10:46.945
- Ask yourself:

10:46.947 --> 10:50.015
how much is it worth
to you to remove its curse

10:50.017 --> 10:54.185
from your and
your family's souls?

10:58.258 --> 11:00.792
(owl hooting)

11:00.794 --> 11:03.361
Again. Your name?

11:03.363 --> 11:07.032
(stuttering)

11:07.034 --> 11:11.436
- Kuh... Quin...

11:14.708 --> 11:15.774
Quintus.

11:15.776 --> 11:18.076
- Full sentence.

11:23.784 --> 11:24.849
- My...

11:28.555 --> 11:31.790
...name... is...

11:31.792 --> 11:34.726
Quintus.

11:34.728 --> 11:38.863
- So named because you
are the fifth Invictus

11:38.865 --> 11:41.700
the unconquerable,

11:41.702 --> 11:43.735
the invincible.

11:43.737 --> 11:48.106
Begotten of the Master,
the seventh original strix.

11:51.178 --> 11:54.813
It is too hard for you
to understand now.

11:56.750 --> 11:59.417
You bear the Master's mark, yes.

11:59.419 --> 12:03.154
But not all who
have horns are demons.

12:17.671 --> 12:20.505
The desire you feel,
your thirst.

12:20.507 --> 12:24.909
It is your nature.
Animal blood is not enough.

12:24.911 --> 12:27.412
You must feed
on the very species

12:27.414 --> 12:30.949
you were created to save.
You must be strong.

12:30.951 --> 12:34.385
The Master has surely
been hunting you.

12:34.387 --> 12:37.522
You will remain
hidden here, with me,

12:37.524 --> 12:40.792
until such time as you are
ready to fulfill the prophecy.

12:40.794 --> 12:43.528
(low growl)
- You are exalted, Quintus.

12:43.530 --> 12:46.965
A unique being
destined for greatness.

12:48.235 --> 12:50.034
For you alone can rid this world

12:50.036 --> 12:52.537
of his foul scourge.

12:52.539 --> 12:55.140
You are the savior.

13:08.922 --> 13:12.791
(men yelling)
(gunshots)

13:32.779 --> 13:36.014
(growling)
- It's OK, Mama.

13:36.016 --> 13:39.184
It's me, Gus. I just wanna
give you something to eat, OK?

13:39.186 --> 13:42.887
(screeching)
(Gus grunting)

13:46.193 --> 13:48.960
Relax. Relax, Mom. Relax.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.795
I don't want
to hurt you. OK, Ma.

13:50.797 --> 13:53.231
(growling)

13:57.003 --> 14:00.038
(knocking)
(snarling)

14:00.040 --> 14:02.307
(knocking)
Go away!

14:02.309 --> 14:04.809
It's not a good time!
- (man, muffled): Gus!

14:04.811 --> 14:07.779
(man speaking Spanish)

14:07.781 --> 14:10.715
- Angel? Angel, what's up, bro?

14:10.717 --> 14:13.017
Uh, I'm a little busy
right now, OK?

14:13.019 --> 14:14.686
I'll catch up with
you later, alright?

14:14.688 --> 14:15.787
- Gus!

14:15.789 --> 14:17.388
(growling, snarling)

14:17.390 --> 14:18.823
- Angel!

14:18.825 --> 14:20.058
Just get outta here, OK?

14:20.060 --> 14:22.060
(speaking Spanish)

14:24.664 --> 14:26.698
- Gus!

14:26.700 --> 14:29.868
Gus!
(crashing)

14:29.870 --> 14:32.103
Gus.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.245
(screeching)

14:40.247 --> 14:42.413
(growling)

14:46.820 --> 14:49.153
(siren wailing)

14:49.155 --> 14:52.090
(helicopter chopping)

14:56.162 --> 14:57.695
- So help me out here.

14:57.697 --> 15:00.231
The Master is not
your biological father,

15:00.233 --> 15:04.736
of course, because<i> strigoi,</i>
by their very nature,

15:04.738 --> 15:07.272
don't possess
the proper equipment.

15:07.274 --> 15:09.941
- If that inquiry was meant
to be a joke, I'm just as happy

15:09.943 --> 15:12.410
to ride in silence.
- No, no, no, I'm dead serious.

15:12.412 --> 15:15.680
I want to know how it works.
Is it transduction?

15:17.684 --> 15:21.185
The transfer of genetic material
from one organism to the other

15:21.187 --> 15:22.921
by a viral agent.

15:25.759 --> 15:27.091
- I was conceived

15:27.093 --> 15:29.060
by two humans,
just like yourself.

15:29.062 --> 15:31.062
But at some point,
my biological mother

15:31.064 --> 15:33.398
was stung by the Master.
- Turned.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.333
- Infected.

15:37.938 --> 15:42.073
There is a stricture in the lore
about turning a pregnant woman.

15:42.075 --> 15:45.310
The lore states the resulting
creature would bear their mark,

15:45.312 --> 15:47.312
but not carry their plague.

15:47.314 --> 15:50.648
And that this creature would be
their undoing. At some point,

15:50.650 --> 15:53.284
the Master must have sensed the
presence of a second heartbeat

15:53.286 --> 15:55.653
when he attacked my mother,

15:55.655 --> 15:58.823
but for some reason

15:58.825 --> 16:01.426
he was prevented from
destroying her at that time.

16:01.428 --> 16:03.628
- So when your mother
metamorphosed into a<i> strigoi,</i>

16:03.630 --> 16:07.198
the Master's infection
changed you in utero.

16:09.135 --> 16:11.202
- An orphaned monster
from the start.

16:15.141 --> 16:18.910
- OK, I think I understand that,

16:18.912 --> 16:22.146
but I still don't get how
when he dies, you die.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.182
- All you need to know is that
in me, the Master has sown

16:24.184 --> 16:28.920
the seed of his own destruction.
It is my destiny. So, yes.

16:28.922 --> 16:31.022
This is a suicide
mission for me.

16:31.024 --> 16:33.124
- If the mythology is true.
- It is true.

16:33.126 --> 16:35.793
Three weeks ago you believed
nothing. Do not presume to know

16:35.795 --> 16:38.029
what you will believe
three weeks from now --

16:38.031 --> 16:40.898
if you're still alive.

16:42.936 --> 16:44.936
- Fair enough.

16:44.938 --> 16:47.405
(intense music)

16:54.681 --> 16:57.348
(bird calling)

16:57.350 --> 17:01.019
(crickets chirping)

17:03.556 --> 17:06.591
(low rumbling)

17:09.362 --> 17:11.396
(distant howling)

17:11.398 --> 17:15.433
(owl hooting)

17:17.737 --> 17:20.938
(growling)

17:25.245 --> 17:28.379
(growling)

17:43.730 --> 17:46.197
(screeching)

17:46.199 --> 17:49.467
(growling)
(shrieking)

17:57.243 --> 18:00.078
(crunching)

18:04.951 --> 18:06.984
(whimpering)

18:14.861 --> 18:18.930
- He has found you.
He will come here now.

18:18.932 --> 18:21.265
- Good. Let him come.

18:21.267 --> 18:24.068
- No! You're not ready yet.

18:24.070 --> 18:27.638
The Master is too powerful.
We must go, right this moment.

18:31.111 --> 18:34.178
(buzzing)

18:40.120 --> 18:43.187
♪♪♪

19:02.809 --> 19:05.143
(crackling)

19:05.145 --> 19:07.311
(dripping)

19:29.769 --> 19:32.336
(growling)

19:38.344 --> 19:40.711
- You are Invictus.

19:42.315 --> 19:46.684
You would take up
silver arms against me?

19:46.686 --> 19:49.120
You have spirit, Invictus.

19:49.122 --> 19:52.156
- My name is Quintus.

19:52.158 --> 19:57.128
- You carry yourself
like a human.

19:57.130 --> 20:00.131
- Quintus, do not engage him.

20:00.133 --> 20:03.334
- I am the agent
of your destruction.

20:03.336 --> 20:06.370
- The huntress has indulged
your human half.

20:06.372 --> 20:09.574
I will put your
resolve to the test.

20:09.576 --> 20:13.678
- I am ready
to fulfill my destiny.

20:13.680 --> 20:17.648
- No. Not in battle, Invictus.

20:19.385 --> 20:23.087
Deprivation will reveal
your true nature.

20:28.828 --> 20:32.263
(rumbling)

21:02.395 --> 21:05.263
(snarling)

21:05.265 --> 21:07.632
- That's my mom, Angel.

21:17.443 --> 21:20.645
I don't care. I don't care,
OK? I live here;

21:20.647 --> 21:23.381
I can keep her safe.

21:23.383 --> 21:27.351
You know, I can feed her until
we figure out something to do.

21:34.460 --> 21:37.328
You don't know how I feel!

21:39.766 --> 21:42.733
You don't know how this feels.

21:55.982 --> 21:58.749
I won't do it.

21:58.751 --> 22:01.519
I can't do it.

22:01.521 --> 22:04.488
She's in there, OK?

22:04.490 --> 22:08.326
She's in there somewhere and
that's all that matters to me.

22:14.300 --> 22:18.269
(growling)

22:18.271 --> 22:20.604
- Let me do what you can't.

22:24.544 --> 22:27.378
- Don't even think
about it, Angel.

22:40.560 --> 22:44.528
Try me.

22:48.868 --> 22:50.968
- (whispering): Crazy.

23:00.413 --> 23:02.747
- No! No! No!

23:02.749 --> 23:06.384
(grunting)
No! No!

23:06.386 --> 23:09.587
Don't make me choose!
Don't make me choose!

23:09.589 --> 23:12.556
(siren beeping)

23:12.558 --> 23:15.359
- (man): [Attention residents!
This is the Safe Street]

23:15.361 --> 23:18.162
[Initiative sweep team.]

23:18.164 --> 23:20.664
[We will be conducting
a sweep of all the buildings]

23:20.666 --> 23:25.403
[on this street. All residents
are required to comply.]

23:25.405 --> 23:27.438
- They're gonna get
this building next.

23:27.440 --> 23:30.708
- [Please exit your
building for inspection]

23:30.710 --> 23:32.710
[or you'll be
subject to arrest.]

23:32.712 --> 23:35.613
- You gonna stand there
or you gonna help me?

23:37.717 --> 23:41.252
You know, I've had enough of
your shit. I don't need you, OK?

23:41.254 --> 23:43.254
- OK, OK.
- Come on,

23:43.256 --> 23:45.022
before they catch
both of us in here, man.

23:47.460 --> 23:49.627
It's OK.

23:49.629 --> 23:52.797
(snarling)

23:55.201 --> 23:58.002
- Mexican seatbelt.
- That's funny. Can we go now?

24:14.220 --> 24:15.553
- This is never gonna work, man.

24:15.555 --> 24:18.422
- Then leave!

24:18.424 --> 24:19.690
Take the stairs or something!

24:21.627 --> 24:24.195
(elevator ding)

24:27.633 --> 24:30.201
(squeaking)

24:36.242 --> 24:39.376
(rumbling)

24:57.463 --> 25:00.798
(intense music)

25:00.800 --> 25:02.900
(muffled voices)

25:05.505 --> 25:07.705
- (man): Down here. Let's go.

25:07.707 --> 25:09.840
OK, this is it.
Safe Streets Initiative!

25:09.842 --> 25:11.442
Is there anybody in here?

25:11.444 --> 25:12.810
Let's go!

25:12.812 --> 25:14.445
- (whispering): Hold on.
Hold on, hold on.

25:14.447 --> 25:16.213
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Alright, open up!

25:16.215 --> 25:17.281
Check that door down there!

25:19.151 --> 25:21.485
- Aw, shit!

25:21.487 --> 25:24.488
- OK, mama's boy. Now what?

25:24.490 --> 25:27.024
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Relax, man.

25:27.026 --> 25:30.227
We can make it, OK?
But you gotta move fast. OK?

25:30.229 --> 25:32.563
On my cue.

25:35.868 --> 25:38.102
- Safe Street Initiative,
anybody in there?

25:41.874 --> 25:44.875
- Safe Streets Initiative,
anybody in there?

25:44.877 --> 25:46.410
- OK, check, check
the back there.

25:53.019 --> 25:54.885
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- What the hell is this?

25:54.887 --> 25:56.987
- Police! - Relax! Relax! We're
on our way out, alright?

25:56.989 --> 25:59.924
We didn't do anything.
- Take off the blanket. - We are talking.

25:59.926 --> 26:02.560
We are people. Let us go.
- Take the blanket off now!

26:02.562 --> 26:04.995
- It's just my mom,
alright? She's sick;

26:04.997 --> 26:08.098
we're just trying
to get her to the hospital.

26:08.100 --> 26:10.000
- Oh.
- It's alright.

26:10.002 --> 26:12.570
- Take off the goddamn helmet.
- You don't wanna do that.

26:12.572 --> 26:15.806
- Take off the goddamn helmet!
- OK, OK.

26:24.116 --> 26:26.250
(growling)
- Don't move!

26:26.252 --> 26:29.520
(screeching)
(groaning)

26:32.024 --> 26:34.558
- (Gus): Go! Go! Go!
- Freeze!

26:34.560 --> 26:36.961
Stop right there! Put your hands
in the air or we'll shoot!

26:36.963 --> 26:37.962
- Go!
- Don't move!

26:37.964 --> 26:39.763
Hold it right there!

26:39.765 --> 26:42.266
- Hold it right there! Freeze!
- This is your last chance!

26:42.268 --> 26:44.234
(grunting)

26:44.236 --> 26:46.337
- Stay down! Stay down!

26:54.780 --> 26:56.780
(door chime ringing)

26:56.782 --> 26:59.149
(distant siren wailing)

26:59.151 --> 27:01.852
(door creaking)

27:14.767 --> 27:15.833
(distant clunking)

27:20.172 --> 27:22.906
- Here, kitty, kitty.

27:59.712 --> 28:01.779
(snarling)

28:01.781 --> 28:05.249
(growling)

28:11.891 --> 28:13.724
Well, that's quite
a communications network

28:13.726 --> 28:17.127
you got going there. Anyway,
thanks for taking my call.

28:17.129 --> 28:19.463
- (Master's voice):
Goodweather--

28:19.465 --> 28:23.100
- I'm doing the talking.

28:27.206 --> 28:29.406
I got your goddamn book.

28:29.408 --> 28:31.675
If you want it, you're gonna
have to come through

28:31.677 --> 28:34.144
on your end.
Here are the terms.

28:34.146 --> 28:37.081
You will show up yourself.

28:37.083 --> 28:40.884
Not your Nazi butler. You.

28:40.886 --> 28:42.920
You will bring my son.

28:42.922 --> 28:45.923
You will show him to me
before I give you the book.

28:45.925 --> 28:49.426
He will be unharmed.
He will be human.

28:49.428 --> 28:52.096
The exchange will occur
just after sundown.

28:52.098 --> 28:55.265
The location? A favorite
fishing spot of Zack and mine.

28:55.267 --> 28:58.902
He knows it.
Not Kelly, no one else.

28:58.904 --> 29:01.472
If you don't bring him...

29:03.609 --> 29:06.410
I will know that
he is dead or turned

29:06.412 --> 29:09.613
and you will never get the book.

29:09.615 --> 29:12.015
Blink if you understand.

29:15.621 --> 29:17.855
I'm hanging up now.

29:22.128 --> 29:24.428
- The die is cast.

29:24.430 --> 29:25.929
- Will he go through with it?

29:25.931 --> 29:29.700
- The Master will reveal
himself for the<i> Lumen.</i>

29:29.702 --> 29:31.135
That's all I need.

29:56.629 --> 29:57.694
- Quintus.

29:58.798 --> 30:02.332
I know that you also thirst.

30:02.334 --> 30:04.935
I am dying.

30:04.937 --> 30:08.472
(groans)
- You will continue to waste.

30:08.474 --> 30:11.175
And when the Master returns,

30:11.177 --> 30:15.412
you will be too weak
to defend yourself.

30:23.122 --> 30:26.123
Drink me, Quintus,

30:26.125 --> 30:30.861
and use me and
your strength to escape.

30:30.863 --> 30:33.697
Do not fight him.

30:33.699 --> 30:37.868
There will be another
opportunity to defeat him.

30:37.870 --> 30:40.270
But not here.

30:40.272 --> 30:42.005
Not now.

30:42.975 --> 30:45.275
You must escape.

30:45.277 --> 30:50.047
- I won't do it.

30:50.049 --> 30:53.717
- The Master cannot love.

30:53.719 --> 30:56.019
So he takes it from others,

30:56.021 --> 30:59.289
feeds upon it,
along with their blood.

31:00.626 --> 31:04.394
I don't know
if you can feel love, Quintus.

31:04.396 --> 31:08.532
But I can.

31:08.534 --> 31:09.900
And I do.

31:11.804 --> 31:13.971
I love you like a son.

31:18.077 --> 31:20.210
- Mother.

31:20.212 --> 31:22.713
- Please, my son.

31:24.683 --> 31:27.117
I am suffering.

31:36.862 --> 31:38.929
Drink.

31:44.737 --> 31:45.802
(shrieks)

31:48.073 --> 31:50.407
(gulping)

31:55.748 --> 31:58.916
(rumbling)

32:06.692 --> 32:08.592
(whooshing)

32:10.629 --> 32:13.196
- The half-breed
has chosen his path.

32:14.867 --> 32:16.300
Good.

32:16.302 --> 32:18.535
Come to me, Invictus.

32:18.537 --> 32:22.806
I will show you and teach you
things beyond your dreams.

32:22.808 --> 32:27.945
- Yes, I can only imagine

32:27.947 --> 32:30.781
the wonder of your world, Lord.

32:30.783 --> 32:33.250
The majesty

32:33.252 --> 32:37.254
of residing underground
like a snake.

32:37.256 --> 32:39.957
A fugitive of nature.

32:39.959 --> 32:42.225
Afraid of the sun.

32:42.227 --> 32:46.263
- Need I remind you; the night
lasts as long as the day.

32:46.265 --> 32:50.968
- And I am doomed to stand
astride both worlds...

32:51.971 --> 32:55.305
the light and the dark.

32:58.243 --> 33:01.011
You cannot control me
as you do your creatures.

33:01.013 --> 33:03.080
It frustrates you, doesn't it?

33:03.082 --> 33:07.818
To know you will
never be my Master.

33:07.820 --> 33:10.087
(growling)

33:12.691 --> 33:16.760
- The huntress has indulged
your human half too well.

33:22.034 --> 33:24.501
(growling)

33:26.638 --> 33:28.839
- We will meet again.

33:33.612 --> 33:36.179
(alarm ringing)
(siren wailing)

33:38.117 --> 33:40.650
- The<i> Lumen</i> is heading
out of the Safe Zone.

33:40.652 --> 33:42.719
Why, I can't tell. Alright?

33:42.721 --> 33:45.122
But this is the quickest
route. The last checkpoint

33:45.124 --> 33:47.657
is just up ahead.
After that, all bets are off.

33:47.659 --> 33:50.027
(rattling)

33:50.029 --> 33:51.528
(distant siren)

33:51.530 --> 33:52.729
You alright?

33:54.066 --> 33:57.634
- I will be if you drive faster!

34:00.005 --> 34:03.507
- You know, catching up to him
is just like half the battle,

34:03.509 --> 34:07.377
right? The Born is kinda fast
and kinda strong and invincible.

34:09.681 --> 34:11.748
It's a good thing
I brought these along.

34:18.924 --> 34:22.059
- Revenge has clouded
the Born's mind.

34:22.061 --> 34:25.595
An affliction with which
I have personal experience.

34:25.597 --> 34:29.533
But if that white-blooded
bastard costs me

34:29.535 --> 34:32.169
my best opportunity
of defeating the Master, I...

34:34.006 --> 34:36.273
I know where this is going!

34:47.719 --> 34:50.287
(indistinct men's voices)

35:00.199 --> 35:04.267
- Hey, what is this?
Huh, what is it?

35:04.269 --> 35:07.070
(radio chattering)
You didn't book us.

35:07.072 --> 35:10.407
No fingerprints, no phone call?

35:10.409 --> 35:12.576
- Not no more. 10 out, 3 back?
