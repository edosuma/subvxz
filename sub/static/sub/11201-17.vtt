Another one here.

JACKSON: Medic!

00:31.131 --> 00:32.894
He's still breathing.

00:34.901 --> 00:38.200
Sam! Mitchell! We've got Bra'tac here.
He's in rough shape.

00:38.304 --> 00:40.670
Dr. Jackson,
we have numerous bodies here.

00:40.774 --> 00:43.800
- How many?
- I don't know.

00:46.346 --> 00:49.213
Oh, my God. Cam! Medic!

00:54.421 --> 00:55.786
It's Teal'c.

02:05.825 --> 02:08.419
NISAL: I am tired of this rhetoric.

02:08.895 --> 02:13.992
How long can we talk of reforming
councils and ridiculous trade policies?

02:14.367 --> 02:17.632
The Ori are taking our planets by force.

02:18.004 --> 02:21.701
Dividing our people
through religious ideology and fear.

02:22.075 --> 02:24.839
We must fight back now.

02:24.944 --> 02:26.707
We all agree, Nisal.

02:27.247 --> 02:29.181
That is why we are here.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.747
But entering into a war
without leadership,

02:32.852 --> 02:37.016
without proper organization,
would merely be mass suicide.

02:37.957 --> 02:42.360
We must learn from our mistakes
in overthrowing the Goa'uld.

02:43.029 --> 02:48.126
For generations, we have plotted
and fought for our emancipation.

02:48.568 --> 02:53.005
Never once did we plan for what we would
do with that freedom after it was ours.

02:57.844 --> 03:02.611
The resulting infighting and weakness
after our victory over the Goa'uld

03:02.715 --> 03:07.277
is what leads us to this vulnerability
at the hands of the Ori now.

It's nice to see you conscious again.

03:35.648 --> 03:37.741
How long have I been...

03:37.850 --> 03:40.717
You've been out for quite a while.
About two weeks.

03:40.820 --> 03:42.378
It was pretty touch and go there.

03:42.488 --> 03:44.479
It took three rounds of surgery
just to stop the bleeding

03:44.591 --> 03:46.650
and repair the damage to your spine.

03:46.759 --> 03:49.785
I have to admit, I was more than a little
worried that you wouldn't walk again,

03:49.896 --> 03:52.387
but it looks like
you're gonna pull through this.

03:52.498 --> 03:54.625
The others will be glad to hear
that you're awake.

03:54.734 --> 03:57.999
At least one of them has pretty much
been here ever since they brought you in.

03:58.104 --> 04:01.267
Of course, I don't know
where they are right now.

04:08.581 --> 04:10.378
He was awake for a few minutes.

04:10.483 --> 04:12.542
Does he know about Bra'tac?

04:12.952 --> 04:14.749
I barely got a chance to tell him
what he's been through,

04:14.854 --> 04:19.154
or what he's going to have to go through
to get back up on his feet, for that matter.

04:19.259 --> 04:22.558
Been there. It's not a good place.

04:29.869 --> 04:31.063
Hey.

04:39.379 --> 04:40.903
What has transpired?

04:42.248 --> 04:44.079
Dr. Lam thinks you should rest.

04:44.183 --> 04:49.052
But we need you to be on your feet and
back in fighting form as soon as possible.

04:49.822 --> 04:51.050
Tell me.

04:56.195 --> 04:57.890
We counted 32 dead

04:58.698 --> 05:00.962

CARTER: When you didn't check in,
we came to investigate.

05:20.353 --> 05:23.550
MITCHELL: We can't be sure, but it looks
like three separate explosive devices

05:23.656 --> 05:25.954
are responsible for the damage.

05:26.059 --> 05:27.583
And what of Bra'tac?

05:27.694 --> 05:29.059
He survived.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.562
If he is here, then I wish to see him.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.828
- Teal'c, you're in no condition...
- Now!

05:36.936 --> 05:39.632
Listen, you are very lucky to be alive.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.944
Is he badly injured?

he was going to come out of this,

06:57.316 --> 07:01.150
I have received further intelligence
from Jaffa with close ties to Parnon,

07:01.254 --> 07:04.121
- the Jaffa that organized the summit.
- And?

07:04.223 --> 07:07.659
It is believed that a Jaffa named Arkad
is responsible.

07:08.027 --> 07:09.619
I have knowledge of him.

07:09.729 --> 07:12.960
We once engaged in battle,
as opposing First Primes.

07:13.065 --> 07:14.930
He is a warrior without honor.

07:15.034 --> 07:18.663
Which would explain why he chose
to bomb a peaceful leadership summit.

07:18.771 --> 07:21.865
It is believed that
Arkad has slowly and quietly

07:21.974 --> 07:24.875
been building support for himself
as a new leader.

07:24.977 --> 07:28.936
A leader that would deliver
the Jaffa nation into the hands of the Ori.

07:29.048 --> 07:32.848
So, he would obviously be opposed
to the organizing of a council

07:32.952 --> 07:35.284
also meant to lead the Jaffa,

07:35.388 --> 07:39.222
especially one that was intending
to unite them against the Ori.

07:39.325 --> 07:41.691
Arkad is dangerous
and must be eliminated.

07:41.794 --> 07:44.194
- Teal'c.
- General Landry,

07:44.297 --> 07:45.958
Arkad must be found and killed

07:46.065 --> 07:49.034
before any more innocent Jaffa
are senselessly slaughtered.

07:49.135 --> 07:53.401
I'm not going to order you and SG-1
to hunt down and kill someone

07:53.506 --> 07:56.066
based on what seems to be rumor,
at this point.

07:56.175 --> 07:57.870
Would you be so cautious, General Landry,

07:57.977 --> 08:01.970
if it were a team of humans
that had been killed in that bombing?

08:03.649 --> 08:06.083
I know what you're going through
right now,

08:06.185 --> 08:08.380
so I'm going to let that pass.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.353
Arkad is a monster.

08:10.456 --> 08:13.186
In the past, he has existed solely
on the fringes.

08:13.292 --> 08:17.558
But now, if he is allowed to continue
to use fear and tyranny

08:17.663 --> 08:22.362
to gain control of a significant Jaffa army
and a fleet of ships, believe me,

08:22.468 --> 08:26.837
he will become as much an issue for Earth
as anyone else in the galaxy.

08:28.941 --> 08:33.037
Teal'c, you've done a tremendous job
getting back on your feet,

08:33.145 --> 08:37.548
but Dr. Lam is saying
you're not ready for active duty just yet.

08:37.650 --> 08:40.517
I'm asking you to give it a little more time.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.713
I have given it enough time!

08:56.302 --> 08:58.896
The resources of this facility
are not going to be used

08:59.005 --> 09:01.496
to fulfill one man's personal revenge.

09:01.607 --> 09:03.302
I'm just saying, if Arkad is responsible

09:03.409 --> 09:04.706
and Teal'c's right about him
being a bad man...

09:04.810 --> 09:07.540
I've already issued a new memo
to all teams

09:07.647 --> 09:10.616
to consider the investigation
a top priority.

09:10.716 --> 09:14.117
I don't think a memo's going to cut it
as far as Teal'c is concerned, sir.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.711
I take it you've tried to talk him out
of leaving?

09:16.822 --> 09:20.622
Yes, sir. Like sticking my foot out
to trip a freight train.

09:21.294 --> 09:23.159
I can't say that I blame him, sir.

09:23.262 --> 09:26.561
I don't either.
He's here of his own free will.

09:26.666 --> 09:28.759
He can leave if he wants to.

09:42.281 --> 09:45.375
So, I was thinking we could Zat him,
toss him in a holding cell

09:45.484 --> 09:47.918
until he comes to his senses.

09:48.020 --> 09:50.250
I was thinking
it's not too late to go with him.

09:50.356 --> 09:53.223
I offered. He doesn't want us to.

09:53.326 --> 09:56.989

13:43.722 --> 13:46.953

14:10.683 --> 14:13.208
Not much. I know she's dead.

14:13.652 --> 14:16.212
Teal'c's mother was killed

an embarrassing victory

14:19.425 --> 14:20.790

14:20.893 --> 14:22.918

someone slipped into her village

14:25.898 --> 14:28.298
and slit her throat in the night.

14:28.667 --> 14:32.262
And Teal'c believed
it was Arkad's revenge for the defeat?

14:32.905 --> 14:34.736
It was never proven.

14:34.840 --> 14:38.833
But still, knowing Teal'c, I mean,
why didn't he go after Arkad immediately?

He was First Prime of Apophis at the time.

14:42.081 --> 14:44.675

We've been maintaining contact
with anti-Ori rebels on P8T-365.

15:18.517 --> 15:22.044
That's a predominantly Jaffa planet that's
already succumbed to Ori control, right?

15:22.154 --> 15:25.920
Right. This group we've been monitoring
opposes Ori occupation, quietly so far,

15:26.025 --> 15:28.289
but is keeping us apprised
of their intentions.

15:28.394 --> 15:32.421
Anyway, they say several hundred Jaffa,
including a few of their inside men,

15:32.531 --> 15:36.729
are regularly being ferried by mother ship
to another planet to mine raw naquadah.

15:36.835 --> 15:42.171
That makes sense. The Ori warriors will be
able to make ships, weapons, supergates.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.265
Yes, but here's the interesting part.

15:44.376 --> 15:47.402
The Jaffa say
this is not being done for the Ori.

15:47.513 --> 15:50.448
- At least, not directly.
- Well, how is that possible?

15:50.549 --> 15:53.609
It's an Ori planet. Somebody's building
weapons right under their noses?

15:53.719 --> 15:56.153
Apparently, a Jaffa named Arkad

15:56.255 --> 15:59.122
has muscled his way into
a relationship with the Ori.

15:59.224 --> 16:02.193
Says he'll police the planet,
get even more Jaffa planets to fall in line.

16:02.294 --> 16:04.353
Well, that's in line with the intel we have.

16:04.463 --> 16:09.992
Yes, it seems Arkad is planning a fairly
major play to impress his new friends.

16:10.102 --> 16:11.899
Word's floating around that
this weapons-grade naquadah

16:12.004 --> 16:15.371
is being stockpiled in various locations
for use by Arkad,

16:15.474 --> 16:17.840

When I die, I will ascend
and join them in everlasting glory.

17:26.111 --> 17:27.703
That is untrue.

17:28.313 --> 17:30.781
You will not convince me otherwise.

17:31.683 --> 17:33.674
That is most unfortunate.

17:35.120 --> 17:40.683
I have medicine that would save your life,
should you tell me what I wish to know.

17:40.793 --> 17:42.021
Never.

17:42.561 --> 17:45.621
Then there are some things
that you should know.

17:46.498 --> 17:49.092
The Ori do not ascend their followers.

17:50.569 --> 17:53.970
Arkad is a coward
who will die by my hand.

Also, I have implanted an explosive device
within your symbiote pouch.

18:00.979 --> 18:04.005
It is set to detonate
within a matter of moments.

18:04.116 --> 18:07.552
It is the same explosive
that you used to kill 12 warriors,

18:07.653 --> 18:11.817
18 innocent bystanders, and two children
who had gathered for a peaceful summit.

18:11.924 --> 18:15.758
They were sinners all,
who chose the path of evil.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.163
Ten seconds.

18:21.967 --> 18:23.764
Where are you going?

18:23.869 --> 18:25.632
I am leaving.

18:25.737 --> 18:27.705
You are about to explode.

18:31.310 --> 18:33.107
(SCREAMS)

18:43.288 --> 18:47.122
So, what does this Arkad
have to gain by attacking Earth?

18:47.226 --> 18:49.820
Maybe he's trying to up his street cred.

18:49.928 --> 18:51.020
Well, it could be revenge.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.121
It's possible he blames us for
what happened at Dakara.

18:53.232 --> 18:55.257
For all we know,
it was the Ori who instructed him

18:55.367 --> 18:57.460
to try to weaken our resolve.

18:57.569 --> 18:59.799
They must know a direct attack
on Earth is risky

18:59.905 --> 19:01.668
because of the Antarctic defense system.

19:01.773 --> 19:03.798
Well, right now,
we have no way of detecting,

19:03.909 --> 19:06.275
let alone stopping, a cloaked cargo ship.

19:06.378 --> 19:08.243
They could go after
whatever targets they want.

19:08.347 --> 19:10.440
Not to mention the countless casualties
that would be created

19:10.549 --> 19:12.380
that would throw the rest of the planet
into chaos.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.611
Primed and ready for an Ori attack.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.415
I thought the Jaffa were all about honor

19:16.522 --> 19:18.422
and meeting their enemy
on the battlefield.

19:18.524 --> 19:21.652
- Yeah, apparently not this guy.
- So, what do we do?

19:22.060 --> 19:24.858
It sounds to me like Teal'c
has the right idea.

19:24.963 --> 19:27.261
<i>HARRIMAN: Unscheduled</i>
<i>offworld activation!</i>

19:27.533 --> 19:29.398
(ALARM SOUNDING)

19:30.135 --> 19:32.330
Receiving a transmission, sir.

19:32.437 --> 19:33.734
On screen.

19:34.773 --> 19:38.709
<i>ARKAD: Warriors of the Tau'ri,</i>
<i>I bid you greetings.</i>

19:39.678 --> 19:42.146
This is General Landry
of Stargate Command.

19:42.247 --> 19:43.612
To whom am I speaking?

19:43.715 --> 19:47.674
<i>My name is Arkad.</i>
<i>I am the leader of the Illac Renin.</i>

19:47.786 --> 19:51.153
It's Ancient. Loosely translated,
it means "kingdom of the path."

19:51.256 --> 19:52.917
What can we do for you?

19:53.025 --> 19:55.858
<i>I wish to be granted safe passage</i>
<i>to your planet</i>

19:55.961 --> 19:57.258
<i>so that we may meet in person</i>

19:57.362 --> 19:59.922
<i>and discuss certain issues</i>
<i>that concern us both.</i>

20:00.032 --> 20:03.229
<i>By now, you have undoubtedly learned</i>
<i>of a plot</i>

20:03.335 --> 20:06.236
<i>to brazenly strike at your planet</i>
<i>in a most cowardly manner.</i>

20:06.338 --> 20:09.535
<i>I want to offer my assistance, as I believe</i>

20:09.641 --> 20:13.577
<i>I am uniquely capable of stopping</i>
<i>this most dishonorable attack.</i>

20:22.588 --> 20:25.079
He no doubt fed you
the information about the attack

20:25.190 --> 20:28.489
so that he could then claim to be
the one who could prevent it.

20:28.594 --> 20:32.030
Yeah, we figured that.
But what we don't know is why.

20:32.130 --> 20:33.654
And given the very real threat
that's out there,

20:33.765 --> 20:36.598
the IOA wants us to
hear what he has to say.

20:36.702 --> 20:40.263
He is a serpent. You must not trust him.

20:40.372 --> 20:43.466
- I'll let you know how it goes.
- I already know.

20:43.909 --> 20:45.900
Nothing good will come of it.

20:54.720 --> 20:57.086
Arkad, I'm sure you know of SG-1.

20:57.189 --> 21:03.059
Lieutenant Colonels Mitchell and Carter,
Dr. Daniel Jackson, and Vala Mal Doran.

21:03.161 --> 21:05.994
It's an honor to finally meet you all
in person.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.725
I have looked forward to this day
for some time.

21:07.833 --> 21:09.801
Let's sit down, shall we?

21:16.575 --> 21:18.440
A shame Teal'c is not here.

21:18.543 --> 21:20.977
We have not had the pleasure
of seeing each other in many years.

21:21.079 --> 21:24.242
We couldn't guarantee your safety
if he was here.

21:24.816 --> 21:28.877
Surely, he does not still hold a grudge
for past battles we once waged

21:28.987 --> 21:30.887
in the name of former false gods?

21:30.989 --> 21:34.220
No, I think it has more to do
with recent events.

21:34.326 --> 21:37.352
I assume you are referring
to the tragedy at Dar Eshkalon?

21:37.462 --> 21:42.365
Yeah, in which your good buddy Teal'c
came this close to dying.

21:42.467 --> 21:44.560
Bra'tac sends his regards, as well.

21:44.670 --> 21:47.230
I don't think he'll mind me
speaking for him when I say that

21:47.339 --> 21:50.706
he'd love to stab you in the eye
with a really big knife.

21:51.476 --> 21:54.138
Thirty-two other Jaffa
weren't nearly as lucky as they were.

21:54.246 --> 21:57.340
You must understand, all of you,
that there are those out there

21:57.449 --> 22:01.078
who would have me falsely accused
of such cowardly actions.

22:01.186 --> 22:02.847
So, you're saying
you had nothing to do with it?

22:02.954 --> 22:04.979
I fully admit I was against a gathering.

22:05.090 --> 22:07.888
But those in attendance were assembling
to form a council

22:07.993 --> 22:11.554
that would directly oppose my campaign
to lead all Jaffa.

22:11.663 --> 22:13.221
Into the arms of the Ori.

22:13.332 --> 22:16.199
The reason we fought for freedom is so
we could believe in what we want

22:16.301 --> 22:18.701
and not be subjugated by anyone.

22:18.804 --> 22:22.137
And you don't see the Ori
as forcing their beliefs on you?

22:22.240 --> 22:25.266
I see Origin as the organized religion
and the source of salvation

22:25.377 --> 22:27.208
all the Jaffa has always sought.

22:27.312 --> 22:29.371
I think we're getting a little off point here.

22:29.481 --> 22:30.675
I agree.

22:31.249 --> 22:35.948
I assure you, no matter what
our philosophical differences,

22:36.054 --> 22:40.855
I would never authorize the type of attack
that befell the summit at Dar Eshkalon.

22:40.959 --> 22:44.725
But you just happen to know some guys,
less respectable,

22:44.830 --> 22:48.698
less honorable than yourself,
who took matters into their own hands.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.427
As a matter of fact, yes.

22:50.535 --> 22:53.197
And I have learned of similar attacks
against your planet being planned

22:53.305 --> 22:54.897
by a radical sect of Jaffa,

22:55.006 --> 22:57.634
who see the Tau'ri
as a powerful force in the galaxy,

22:57.743 --> 23:01.839
who oppose our peaceful movement
toward embracing Origin.

23:01.947 --> 23:04.939
- And you can stop them?
- Yes, I believe I can.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.950
I do not agree with their tactics,

23:07.052 --> 23:09.213
but at least we see eye to eye
in basic beliefs.

23:09.321 --> 23:12.779
I can use my influence and my resources

23:12.891 --> 23:15.223
to choke off their ability
to function effectively.

23:15.327 --> 23:17.090
Or you can fund them

23:17.195 --> 23:20.858
and allow them to do your dirty work for
you while you take the political high road.

23:20.966 --> 23:23.833
Let's cut the crap!
We all know you're here for one reason.

23:23.935 --> 23:26.870
- Make your demands.
- I have no demands.

23:26.972 --> 23:31.306
I understand your mistrust,
but, please, I implore you.

23:31.410 --> 23:36.109
Believe me when I say I will use
all of my vast resources at my disposal

23:36.214 --> 23:39.342
to thwart this most heinous threat
to your world.

23:40.185 --> 23:44.281
All I ask in return is you allow the Jaffa
people to believe in what they choose.

23:44.389 --> 23:47.881
If they decide to follow
in the ways of the Illac Renin,

23:48.660 --> 23:50.321
that should be up to them.

23:50.429 --> 23:53.592
If you feel it is your responsibility
to do battle with the Ori

23:53.698 --> 23:58.635
on behalf of the humans of this galaxy,
then that is your prerogative.

23:58.737 --> 24:01.467
Stay out of your way
and you won't attack us?

24:01.573 --> 24:03.370
General, my fleet is more powerful

24:03.475 --> 24:05.773
than any Goa'uld
has ever marshaled by tenfold.

24:05.877 --> 24:07.276
If I was to attack this planet,

24:07.379 --> 24:11.713
it would not be in the manner
currently being planned by these radicals.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.851
And it would not end well for you.

24:15.220 --> 24:16.380
MITCHELL: Really?

24:17.022 --> 24:18.489
You don't say.

24:19.458 --> 24:22.757
Whether or not our people
ever see eye to eye,

24:22.861 --> 24:26.592
I would like to believe that
they could coexist peacefully.

24:26.698 --> 24:28.495
Your planet has played
an instrumental role

24:28.600 --> 24:31.433
in the very reshaping of the nature
of the galaxy.

24:31.536 --> 24:35.233
I merely wish to avoid
any unpleasant conflicts

24:35.340 --> 24:38.400
between our two respective nations,
before they arise.

24:41.713 --> 24:43.271
I take my leave.

24:58.029 --> 25:00.327
LIZAN: I told you where to find Bak'al.

25:00.866 --> 25:05.132
He's the Jaffa scum that I sold
the explosives to. That's all I know.

25:05.237 --> 25:07.137
I do not believe you.

25:07.239 --> 25:09.605
I don't know anything about Arkad.

25:09.708 --> 25:12.802
You despise Jaffa. Why protect him?

25:12.911 --> 25:14.606
I'm not afraid to die.

25:14.713 --> 25:19.412
I have no intention of killing you.
Not until you tell me where to find Arkad.

25:20.051 --> 25:23.578
Why should I tell you anything,
knowing death is my reward?

25:23.688 --> 25:25.679
That may sound sensible for the moment,

25:25.790 --> 25:31.092
but, believe me, in time
you will change your mind.

25:39.004 --> 25:42.906
The IOA is taking the threat of
these attacks against Earth very seriously.

25:43.008 --> 25:44.669
So, what do they want us to do?

25:44.776 --> 25:48.473
- Nothing as far as Arkad is concerned.
- Sir?

25:48.580 --> 25:52.880
They want us to leave him alone for now.
Let him go about his business.

25:54.019 --> 25:56.112
We're supposed to let him muscle us?

25:56.221 --> 25:59.088
Obviously, we need to
assess his capability,

25:59.190 --> 26:02.785
determine if these threats are credible
and who's really behind them.

26:02.894 --> 26:05.624
If we can prove that Arkad does pose
a direct threat to our security...

26:05.730 --> 26:09.689
I'm sorry, sir. We're supposed to, what?
Find WMDs in his back pocket?

26:09.801 --> 26:12.565
Right at the moment,
we need to play the intelligence game,

26:12.671 --> 26:14.662
not get into an all-out war with an enemy

26:14.773 --> 26:18.436
that may have the capability
to inflict severe damage on us.

26:18.543 --> 26:20.443
We need to find out what we can.

26:20.545 --> 26:22.979
- We're on it, sir.
- Not so fast, Colonel.

26:23.081 --> 26:25.311
I plan to put a number of teams on it
right away,

26:25.417 --> 26:29.080
but, at the moment,
I have another mission for you.

26:31.456 --> 26:36.018
In his mind, Teal'c may have severed
his connections with us

26:36.127 --> 26:37.924
when he set out to kill Arkad.

26:38.029 --> 26:39.291
But he's been part of the SGC,

26:39.397 --> 26:42.025
so he'll still be perceived
as acting on our behalf.

26:42.133 --> 26:45.796
If he succeeds in killing Arkad,
even if he tries and fails,

26:45.904 --> 26:49.271
it will be hard to convince people
that he was acting alone.

26:49.374 --> 26:51.865
So you want us to try and stop him?

26:51.977 --> 26:54.343
The IOA is adamant

26:54.446 --> 26:59.213
that Earth, and specifically the SGC,
take no action against Arkad.

26:59.884 --> 27:04.583
I've been charged with ordering you
to find Teal'c

27:05.991 --> 27:08.016
and stop him at all costs.

27:23.642 --> 27:27.009
Hey, no one really thinks
that Arkad gave the SGC

27:27.112 --> 27:31.708
the whereabouts of his home base
of operations out of diplomatic courtesy?

27:31.816 --> 27:33.977
What, you think he did it
to draw us into a trap?

27:34.085 --> 27:35.416
I doubt that.
It's more likely that he knew that

27:35.520 --> 27:37.579
if anyone was determined enough
to find him, they could,

27:37.689 --> 27:39.156
and he wanted to make sure
we'd be blamed

27:39.257 --> 27:40.781
in the event of any attack against him.

27:40.892 --> 27:43.087
Regardless of whether we were behind it.

27:43.194 --> 27:44.422
MITCHELL: Speaking of determined,

27:44.529 --> 27:48.397
has anyone thought about the speech
they're going to give to Teal'c?

27:52.404 --> 27:54.235
No, I didn't think so.

28:04.516 --> 28:07.314
<i>Odyssey,</i> this is Mitchell. We are down.

28:07.419 --> 28:10.013
All right, everybody knows what to do.

28:14.359 --> 28:16.554
Field generators are in place.

28:22.867 --> 28:24.732
Trip sensors are ready.

28:26.905 --> 28:29.601
I'm glad you're so sure about this plan.

28:30.308 --> 28:33.106
One way or the other,
you know he's coming.

28:33.411 --> 28:34.844
He'll want the element of surprise,

28:34.946 --> 28:38.507
so I figure he'll use a cloaked ship,
try to sneak in the back way.

28:38.616 --> 28:40.948
- Well, that's what we would do.
- Exactly.

28:41.720 --> 28:44.621
He just doesn't know
we're going to try and stop him.

28:44.723 --> 28:47.920
You know, regardless of
who's going to try and stop him,

28:48.026 --> 28:50.494
this is Teal'c we're talking about.

28:55.734 --> 28:58.862
You know, Bra'tac seems to think that
if it suits Arkad to attack Earth,

28:58.970 --> 29:01.734
he'll do so
no matter what his agreement with us.

29:01.840 --> 29:05.469
It's possible he just didn't want us
coming after him yet.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.408
So, he leaks the information
about the plot,

29:07.512 --> 29:10.413
pretends to act towards
stopping the attack,

29:11.049 --> 29:13.540
and, with the time that he's bought,
gets his chicks in a row.

29:13.651 --> 29:15.448
That's a pretty good theory.
And it's ducks, by the way.

29:15.553 --> 29:18.283
The only problem is,
we have to prove it to the IOA.

29:18.389 --> 29:24.487
Well, what would be the harm in us just
failing to stop Teal'c from killing Arkad?

29:24.596 --> 29:26.427
It wouldn't be entirely on purpose,

29:26.531 --> 29:30.023
and not out of accidental incompetence
either, if you catch my drift.

29:30.135 --> 29:31.796
Yes, nudge nudge, wink wink.

29:31.903 --> 29:33.495
But if Arkad is the one
planning these attacks,

29:33.605 --> 29:36.301
then I think our best chance of
stopping them is keeping Arkad alive.

29:36.407 --> 29:37.431
Why's that?

29:37.542 --> 29:40.170
He may be the only one that
knows all the pieces to the puzzle.

29:40.278 --> 29:42.143
- Good point.
- Thank you.

29:42.947 --> 29:45.711
How do we get Arkad to tell us
all the pieces of the puzzle?

29:45.817 --> 29:48.149
Oh, that's the easy part.
See, we capture him, lock him in a room,

29:48.253 --> 29:50.847
and threaten to let Teal'c kill him.

29:50.955 --> 29:52.616
- Genius.
- Thank you.

30:12.510 --> 30:16.071
It has occurred to you that
it could take days before Teal'c shows up?

30:16.181 --> 30:17.239
Yeah.

30:18.116 --> 30:21.950
He could also have been here already
and killed Arkad, for all we know.

30:22.053 --> 30:24.453
Half of SG-3 is watching the gate.

30:25.223 --> 30:28.351
We'll get some activity,
one way or the other.

30:28.459 --> 30:30.188
Speaking of which...

30:34.966 --> 30:36.957
Colonel Reynolds, come in.

30:39.804 --> 30:43.535
SG-3, you've missed your scheduled
check in. Please respond.

30:49.914 --> 30:51.245
Stay here.

31:05.230 --> 31:07.755
<i>MITCHELL: Hey, somebody got to</i>
<i>Baker and Reynolds.</i>

31:07.866 --> 31:10.801
They're unconscious, but they're still alive.

31:18.176 --> 31:19.575
Hey, Teal'c?

31:21.112 --> 31:23.740
Teal'c, I know you're out there, buddy.

31:24.682 --> 31:27.276
If you can hear me, I don't know
what you think is going on here,

31:27.385 --> 31:30.183
but we're here to help.

31:33.625 --> 31:38.392
<i>MITCHELL: Okay, that was a lie,</i>
<i>and I feel terrible about it. I hate myself.</i>

31:39.264 --> 31:41.789
<i>TEAL 'C: Why have you set a trap for me,</i>
<i>Colonel Mitchell?</i>

31:43.835 --> 31:44.893
Trap?

31:45.603 --> 31:47.594
That's crazy talk, man.

31:47.705 --> 31:49.536
<i>Why would we set a trap for you?</i>

31:49.641 --> 31:53.042
I intend on killing Arkad.
Do not try and stop me.

31:53.144 --> 31:56.477
Teal'c, it's Daniel.
Listen, now just hear me out.

31:56.581 --> 31:59.379
Now, apparently, there's a radical group
of Jaffa poised to attack Earth.

31:59.484 --> 32:01.509
Arkad claims to have
the means to stop them,

32:01.619 --> 32:03.849
<i>and he says he'll help us</i>
<i>if we leave him alone.</i>

32:03.955 --> 32:06.287
It is likely Arkad is behind those attacks.

32:06.391 --> 32:07.722
<i>Yes, I know, I know. We figured as much.</i>

32:07.825 --> 32:10.726
But we just think
it's best for ourselves and you

32:10.828 --> 32:13.388
if we all just step back
and consider all the angles.

32:13.698 --> 32:15.996
I am not acting on behalf of Earth.

32:16.901 --> 32:19.631
The IOA is worried
it may still look that way.

32:19.737 --> 32:22.262
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>that is no longer my concern.</i>

32:22.674 --> 32:25.973
I will avenge the deaths
of the Jaffa at Dar Eshkalon.

32:26.077 --> 32:28.102
Arkad must die,
no matter what the consequences.

32:28.913 --> 32:30.574
<i>I do not wish to harm any of you.</i>

32:30.682 --> 32:33.810
But if you try and stop me, I will.

32:44.495 --> 32:45.723
So, now what?

32:45.830 --> 32:48.697
Well, he's got to be
headed for the pyramid.

32:59.110 --> 33:00.634
Drop the stick.

33:02.146 --> 33:04.239
Drop the stick.

33:05.149 --> 33:07.242
I do not wish to harm you,
Colonel Mitchell.

33:07.352 --> 33:09.081
Then drop the stick.

33:12.390 --> 33:15.655
You know, I don't think anyone here
wants to get harmed.

33:15.760 --> 33:17.785
Probably me more than you.

33:18.296 --> 33:19.786
Look, Teal'c...

33:24.602 --> 33:26.001
(GRUNTING)

33:57.301 --> 33:58.928
(GROANS)

33:59.370 --> 34:02.362
Okay, all right. We can talk about this.

34:02.473 --> 34:05.374
The time for talk is over, Colonel Mitchell.

35:53.351 --> 35:57.583
ARKAD: After all these years,
still as predictable as ever.

35:58.589 --> 35:59.715
Leave.

36:40.665 --> 36:44.829
You've gotten old and slow. Get up.

36:52.176 --> 36:53.837
(GROANS)

36:54.779 --> 36:57.714
I remember when you were a true warrior,

36:57.815 --> 36:59.874
the pride of Apophis,

36:59.984 --> 37:02.646
feared by all those who opposed you.

37:02.753 --> 37:06.519
Do you remember, Teal'c,
how powerful you were then?

37:07.758 --> 37:09.749
Do you remember Co'rak?

37:10.361 --> 37:12.124
You had us on the run.

37:12.230 --> 37:16.030
You bombarded the planet from space
and you left no survivors!

37:17.001 --> 37:19.060
I lost my parents that day,

37:20.204 --> 37:21.603
my sister,

37:23.174 --> 37:25.142
yet I still admired you.

37:25.876 --> 37:29.778
One day, I thought...
I thought I would be so brave.

37:29.880 --> 37:33.247
I would have the courage
to bring my enemies to their knees,

37:33.351 --> 37:35.945
like the great Jaffa warrior, Teal'c.

37:37.688 --> 37:38.814
Fight!

37:55.740 --> 37:57.298
Look at you now.

37:58.142 --> 37:59.370
A legend.

38:03.114 --> 38:06.345
You defeated
the mighty Goa'uld themselves.

38:06.450 --> 38:08.680
You brought freedom to all Jaffa.

38:08.786 --> 38:14.588
You gave us the chance to seek salvation,
but you, you rejected it yourself.

38:16.494 --> 38:21.932
Your punishment must be
to have gotten so soft and frail.

38:22.033 --> 38:25.969
Have you spent so long with humans
that you've become so much like them?

38:27.238 --> 38:29.103
It's a shame

38:29.206 --> 38:32.869
you won't live to see me
bring the Tau'ri to their knees.

38:46.123 --> 38:47.954
(GRUNTING)

39:35.873 --> 39:40.901
Before you die,
I want you to know the truth.

39:41.011 --> 39:43.571
I had my revenge for the day
that you attacked Co'rak

39:43.681 --> 39:45.911
and you slaughtered my family.

39:51.021 --> 39:52.750
I killed your mother.

39:54.358 --> 39:55.916
(GROANS)

40:26.557 --> 40:27.751
Teal'c!

40:48.512 --> 40:51.003
There was a time when you would have
come away from such a battle

40:51.115 --> 40:52.912
without a scratch.

40:53.017 --> 40:56.578
I'm alive. Arkad is not.

40:58.222 --> 40:59.382
Indeed.

41:02.893 --> 41:05.760
Just finished reading your report, Colonel.

41:06.030 --> 41:07.998
Everything in order, sir?

41:08.098 --> 41:11.124
Arkad set a trap for you,
took you prisoner,

41:11.235 --> 41:13.829
and you were fortunate
Teal'c was there to rescue you.

41:13.938 --> 41:17.874
Arkad was killed
and Teal'c injured in the process.

41:17.975 --> 41:20.068
Yes, sir, that's what it says.

41:20.177 --> 41:23.237
This is going to be a tough pill
for the IOA to swallow, son.

41:23.347 --> 41:26.407
I believe I also mention that
Arkad admitted to planning the attacks

41:26.517 --> 41:27.575
and they were going to
go through with them

41:27.685 --> 41:28.982
regardless of what we'd do.

41:29.086 --> 41:31.987
Yeah, it's too bad
you weren't able to learn more.

41:35.726 --> 41:38.752
Arkad took credit
for the murder of my mother.

41:42.132 --> 41:46.569
If he was responsible, he was too much
a coward to do it himself.

41:47.905 --> 41:50.305
The one who did died by my hand.

41:52.243 --> 41:53.870
You never told me.

41:55.646 --> 41:59.548
Still, Arkad got what he deserved.

42:00.050 --> 42:02.712
There are many more
as corrupt as he was.

42:02.820 --> 42:06.483
And we will hunt them
until they are no more.

42:12.997 --> 42:15.830
I would not like to be
the one who opposes you.

42:16.367 --> 42:19.131
I have learned from the best, old friend.

42:20.504 --> 42:25.168
I have not said this to you before,
and I should have.

42:31.181 --> 42:34.207
You are the son I never had.

42:38.222 --> 42:40.213
I could not be more proud.
