00:48.680 --> 00:52.127
"One day the sun cast onto the world"

00:52.320 --> 00:55.483
to show its image in different light.

00:55.640 --> 00:57.165
All the lines were in place

00:57.320 --> 01:01.120
but in between no shape or shades,

01:01.280 --> 01:05.729
just shadows of the past
cast against an aging brain,

01:05.880 --> 01:10.761
fading with the sunset's dying rays...

01:10.960 --> 01:14.328
Wiping away all trace of yesterday.

01:22.080 --> 01:24.200
Does anyone have any questions
for the author?

03:53.280 --> 03:54.361
Hey, Dad.

03:54.520 --> 03:56.409
<i>Oh, hey.</i>

03:56.560 --> 03:58.244
<i>Can you turn down the music?</i>

03:59.040 --> 04:01.042
What?

04:01.200 --> 04:02.565
<i>The music, can you turn it down?</i>

04:03.240 --> 04:06.289
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:07.320 --> 04:08.810
Sorry.

04:09.440 --> 04:12.091
<i>So, your super told me</i>

04:12.240 --> 04:15.164
<i>that they shut your power off.</i>

04:15.320 --> 04:17.243
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.483
<i>Why didn't you pay the bill?</i>

04:20.640 --> 04:23.769
Oh, because I'm through with that.
I don't need to do that anymore.

04:23.920 --> 04:25.729
I'm going off the map.

04:26.640 --> 04:27.846
<i>What does that mean?</i>

04:28.000 --> 04:30.651
It means that I am through
with the whole system.

04:31.680 --> 04:33.091
<i>What whole system?</i>

04:33.240 --> 04:34.810
The whole manmade system.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.604
I quit my job.

04:36.760 --> 04:38.125
I'm not paying bills.

04:38.280 --> 04:39.441
<i>You quit your job?</i>

04:39.600 --> 04:41.523
Yeah. Yeah, I escaped it.

04:43.640 --> 04:45.608
<i>How... How are you gonna eat?</i>

04:45.800 --> 04:47.802
No-no, I don't need to pay
for food anymore.

04:47.960 --> 04:49.724
I realized that.

04:49.880 --> 04:51.882
I can get free milk at Starbucks.

04:52.040 --> 04:54.361
- I can get free ketchup at McDonald's.
- <i>Ketchup?</i>

04:54.560 --> 04:59.805
Yeah, the body can survive
on ketchup alone just for a long time.

04:59.960 --> 05:01.769
At least until the apocalypse.

05:04.080 --> 05:06.321
<i>Hey Marco,
I'm going to stop by tomorrow,</i>

05:06.480 --> 05:07.840
<i>and I'm gonna bring you some food.</i>

05:07.920 --> 05:10.810
No-no, I don't need food.
I'm fine with ketchup.

05:10.960 --> 05:12.800
- <i>Just be at your apartment...</i>
- Don't do that.

05:12.920 --> 05:14.046
<i>Listen to me!
Listen to me!</i>

05:14.200 --> 05:16.043
- <i>Be at your apartment at 6:00.</i>
- I won't be there.

05:16.200 --> 05:18.646
<i>I'll be there.
I'll see you then. Bye.</i>

05:22.440 --> 05:24.727
- They call me Luna.
- Luna!

05:24.880 --> 05:27.850
Because my mind moves
in tune with the lunar shifts.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.490
They call me a lunatic...

05:30.520 --> 05:32.682
because my biological clock's
a time bomb

05:32.840 --> 05:35.605
that ticks down to the minute
the full moon's lit.

05:37.320 --> 05:39.322
And I just got out of the loony bin,

05:39.520 --> 05:41.249
and I haven't been taking
my medication,

05:41.440 --> 05:44.364
so I'm about as unstable
as if nitro raped glycerin.

05:46.800 --> 05:49.565
More insane than Batman's Riddler
if Jim Carrey had played him

05:49.720 --> 05:51.131
without taking his Ritalin.

05:51.280 --> 05:53.681
I'll leave you riddles
sicker than a crossword puzzle

05:53.840 --> 05:55.001
written by Jack The Ripper.

05:55.160 --> 05:57.083
Full of clues as
to how I'm gonna kill you

05:57.240 --> 05:59.607
which I will do
right before you figure it out

05:59.760 --> 06:02.206
so I can stick it on the ground
next to your dead body

06:02.360 --> 06:04.120
and let the detectives
finish filling it out!

06:25.440 --> 06:27.408
<i>"The fire went out..."</i>

06:28.720 --> 06:30.722
<i>black, not even the smoke</i>

06:30.880 --> 06:33.804
<i>to sniff up the memory
of last night's wild sight</i>

06:33.960 --> 06:35.928
<i>and resurrect its magic back,</i>

06:36.120 --> 06:39.647
<i>sun-burnt on the tip of a matchstick
with one flick of God's finger,</i>

06:39.800 --> 06:41.882
<i>as all eternal blows out...
Lost in shadows...</i>

06:42.040 --> 06:44.202
<i>Surround my lips like vicious flint
with thrilled flicks licked with silk...</i>

06:44.360 --> 06:45.407
<i>It's going up in flames...</i>

06:45.560 --> 06:46.891
<i>As my spirit spreads!</i>

06:47.040 --> 06:48.610
<i>Get away my brains like stretching...</i>

06:48.800 --> 06:49.920
<i>Chain... Can't have wings...</i>

06:50.000 --> 06:51.889
<i>Wildfires rising high in my eyes...</i>

06:52.040 --> 06:53.041
<i>So wild...</i>

06:53.200 --> 06:55.407
Fire irises.

07:01.480 --> 07:02.766
I'm a flame.

07:03.800 --> 07:06.201
I'm a flame!

07:40.080 --> 07:41.206
- Hey.
- Hi.

07:41.360 --> 07:42.521
- You okay?
- Yeah.

07:42.680 --> 07:44.682
- Can I come in?
- Yeah. Yeah, come in.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.164
You know it's
almost 1:00 in the morning?

07:48.360 --> 07:50.010
Shouldn't you be sleeping?

07:50.160 --> 07:52.049
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

07:52.240 --> 07:53.287
What's wrong?

07:54.480 --> 07:55.845
I just wanted to talk.

07:57.160 --> 07:59.447
Oh. Well, sure.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.762
Can we look at some photo albums?

08:01.960 --> 08:03.564
Now?

08:03.720 --> 08:05.722
W-Why do you want to do that?

08:08.720 --> 08:10.484
Just to talk about the past.

08:11.840 --> 08:13.808
I just don't know
where they are, honey.

08:13.960 --> 08:16.008
- They're lost in a huge pile...
- I know where they are.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.730
- I don't think...
- I'll find them.

08:31.800 --> 08:33.370
Remember that?

08:35.720 --> 08:37.688
That was right before I got sick.

08:39.159 --> 08:40.605
Remember?

08:45.080 --> 08:46.445
What was I like?

08:49.000 --> 08:51.321
Baby, you don't remember?

08:53.000 --> 08:54.047
No.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.525
You were the same.

09:03.680 --> 09:05.921
Mom, I need you to be honest with me.

09:06.080 --> 09:09.004
You're the only one
who knew me back then,

09:09.160 --> 09:10.760
- and I need you...
- No. That's not true.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.643
There's a lot of people
in your life who knew you then.

09:12.800 --> 09:14.290
What was I doing...

09:15.440 --> 09:17.488
when it happened?

09:17.640 --> 09:18.926
What do you mean?

09:19.120 --> 09:21.566
I mean, the doctors said
that something has to trigger it.

09:21.720 --> 09:23.085
- So, what was I doing?
- No, no.

09:23.240 --> 09:24.800
There was nothing
that we could've done.

09:24.880 --> 09:26.370
- It was gonna happen no matter what.
- No, no.

09:26.520 --> 09:29.410
N-N-No.
I must've done something to trigger it

09:29.560 --> 09:31.324
- because I am not the same person, Mom.
- No, you didn't.

09:31.480 --> 09:33.040
- I am not the same.
- You are the same.

09:33.080 --> 09:34.923
Would you just please,
just stop lying to me!

09:35.080 --> 09:38.209
Okay, Carla, you are acting
really hyper right now,

09:38.360 --> 09:40.249
and I-I...
Are you sleeping okay?

09:40.400 --> 09:42.209
What's going on?

09:42.360 --> 09:45.284
I'm just trying to figure out
who I am, you know,

09:45.480 --> 09:47.767
because I don't feel like myself anymore.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.526
Even when I go off the medication,
I don't feel like myself.

09:50.680 --> 09:52.330
Okay, you know what, honey?

09:52.480 --> 09:54.642
I think we need to get Dad
because he can really help.

09:54.800 --> 09:55.880
- No-No-No!
- No, we should.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.207
No, Mom, I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have yelled. I won't yell again.

09:58.360 --> 09:59.691
- Please don't get Dad.
- Okay, you're right.

09:59.840 --> 10:01.808
Sit down.
And I have a really good plan.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.325
Okay, this is my plan.

10:03.480 --> 10:04.641
You're gonna spend the night tonight,

10:04.800 --> 10:06.643
and then tomorrow morning,
first thing,

10:06.800 --> 10:08.480
we'll go to the hospital
and get your file.

10:08.600 --> 10:11.251
See, they have a file of everything
about your illness.

10:11.400 --> 10:13.000
And then you can learn
anything you want.

10:13.040 --> 10:14.530
You can ask anything.
Okay?

10:14.680 --> 10:17.365
We'll figure all this out.
Okay?

10:21.520 --> 10:23.648
I hate it when you look
at me like that.

10:23.800 --> 10:25.962
Like what?
How am I looking at you?

10:28.480 --> 10:30.209
Like I'm crazy.

10:30.400 --> 10:32.641
I'm not looking at you
like you're crazy, honey.

10:33.600 --> 10:37.491
No, you're looking at me
like you don't even recognize me.

10:37.640 --> 10:40.644
- No. Honey, I love you.
- No.

10:40.800 --> 10:43.440
- You miss that person that I used to be.
- No, please don't leave.

10:45.120 --> 10:46.610
Donald!

10:48.960 --> 10:53.602
Hey, what happened to your apartment?

10:53.760 --> 10:54.761
What do you mean?

10:54.960 --> 10:57.486
I mean,
your books are all over the floor.

11:00.120 --> 11:04.170
Yeah, I decided
that I liked it better this way.

11:04.320 --> 11:08.211
You know, you can see
all the titles way more easily.

11:08.360 --> 11:12.729
You know, and they're all placed
in different, specific locations.

11:12.880 --> 11:13.961
It actually works out really great

11:14.120 --> 11:16.441
because you can just walk up
to any one of them, you know?

11:16.600 --> 11:19.331
You can walk up to any book
you want at any time, just sit down.

11:19.480 --> 11:23.451
And there's a good variety
of reading environments.

11:23.600 --> 11:28.322
I don't know.
It just seems stupid, somehow,

11:28.480 --> 11:32.087
to just want to put
a bunch of books together in one place.

11:32.240 --> 11:34.322
That just seems
like in-the-box thinking to me.

11:34.480 --> 11:36.130
- Do you know what I mean?
- Hm.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.806
- How you sleeping?
- Good.

11:38.960 --> 11:42.885
I just lie down and sleep.
It's good.

11:43.040 --> 11:44.769
That all works out.

11:46.680 --> 11:48.284
Been taking your medication?

11:49.320 --> 11:52.767
Um... mm...

11:54.880 --> 11:57.247
I found that they really weren't working
for me, you know,

11:57.440 --> 12:02.446
kind of constricted my emotions,
you know, like a dried-up ocean.

12:02.600 --> 12:05.046
That wasn't the potion.

12:05.240 --> 12:06.366
Don't give me the lotion.

12:06.520 --> 12:10.161
I just, yeah, it just didn't work,
so I stopped.

12:10.320 --> 12:11.685
I stopped.

12:11.840 --> 12:13.365
You know what I found works, though?

12:13.520 --> 12:15.170
- What's that?
- Marijuana, Mama.

12:15.320 --> 12:19.120
- You're smoking marijuana?
- Yeah, it actually really helps.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.851
You know, it works
way better than the medication.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.161
Isn't that interesting?

12:23.320 --> 12:27.291
I mean, I guess it has something to do
with my particular brain chemistry,

12:27.440 --> 12:29.602
something about that works.

12:29.760 --> 12:31.091
Do you smoke a lot of marijuana?

12:31.240 --> 12:35.245
Depends on how long I'm awake for.
You know?

12:35.440 --> 12:37.807
Lately I haven't needed
as much sleep, so...

12:38.880 --> 12:41.008
I guess I have to up my dosage.

12:41.760 --> 12:44.764
Tomorrow morning, let's go...
let's go to Dr. Lyons,

12:44.920 --> 12:47.201
and we'll ask him and just hear
what he thinks about that.

12:47.280 --> 12:51.365
- Who cares what he thinks?
- He's an expert on your illness.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.204
- He'll know...
- I don't have an illness.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.680
- Come on...
- Why are you bringing Dr. Lyons into this?

12:56.880 --> 12:58.006
- There's nothing wrong with...
- Let's just...

12:58.160 --> 13:00.242
Wait! That... what is...

13:00.400 --> 13:02.880
- He's an expert on your medication.
- No, he's not a fucking expert!

13:03.040 --> 13:04.280
He's a goddamned Nazi!

13:04.440 --> 13:05.487
He doesn't fucking know

13:05.680 --> 13:06.920
- what he's talking about, okay?
- Okay.

13:07.080 --> 13:08.650
Listen. I don't have an illness.

13:08.800 --> 13:12.964
Why don't you just, please,
come home with me tonight.

13:13.120 --> 13:14.884
Come home?

13:15.040 --> 13:17.520
- Home?
- Home. Yeah.

13:18.560 --> 13:19.641
Right?

13:19.800 --> 13:21.325
Is she there?

13:23.040 --> 13:25.088
- Where is she?
- Who?

13:27.360 --> 13:28.407
Mom?

13:30.880 --> 13:35.090
She left because she's ill.

13:35.240 --> 13:36.526
She's ill. She...

13:36.680 --> 13:38.330
Why do you keep saying that?

13:38.480 --> 13:41.450
She couldn't stand that!
And you know what happened?

13:41.600 --> 13:43.204
- She fucking got away.
- Okay.

13:43.360 --> 13:45.931
You know why?
Because she's a genius.

13:46.080 --> 13:48.003
She's a fucking genius.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.924
Why couldn't you see that?

13:54.360 --> 13:55.771
Okay.

13:58.920 --> 14:00.160
Count to ten.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.002
Remember how she used to do that?
Remember?

14:03.160 --> 14:05.162
Do you remember this?

14:05.360 --> 14:07.442
- Okay, count to ten.
- Oh, come on.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.648
- Just count to ten. Ready?
- Yeah.

14:09.800 --> 14:11.211
Okay.

14:11.360 --> 14:12.805
- One.
- One.

14:12.960 --> 14:14.610
- Two.
- Nine.

14:14.760 --> 14:16.603
- Three.
- Eight.

14:16.760 --> 14:18.000
- Four.
- Seven.

14:18.160 --> 14:19.810
Five.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.243
Six. Seven.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.607
Eight. Nine.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.404
You're it!

14:27.560 --> 14:29.164
Oh, Marco, no-no!

14:30.240 --> 14:31.969
Fuck!

15:24.720 --> 15:28.406
Hi. I was a patient here,
and I need a copy of my file.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.200
I know you're obligated to give it to me.

15:30.360 --> 15:32.362
- Yes. What's your name?
- Carla. Lucia.

15:32.520 --> 15:34.966
L-U-C-I-A.
It's right there. That one.

15:38.120 --> 15:39.724
Can you wait just one moment?

15:54.560 --> 15:56.767
Hi. I'm Dr. Strinsky.

15:57.320 --> 15:58.367
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:58.560 --> 16:02.451
I wonder if I could ask
what you want your records for?

16:03.440 --> 16:05.488
I don't have to tell you.
I know my rights.

16:05.640 --> 16:07.369
Oh, you're right.
You don't have to tell me.

16:07.520 --> 16:08.521
It's just that I...

16:08.680 --> 16:10.648
it seems like you're upset
about something,

16:10.800 --> 16:14.327
- and I just want to make sure that...
- No, I just want a copy of my file.

16:14.480 --> 16:16.323
Sure.
You can come in my office,

16:16.480 --> 16:20.280
and I'll sit and if you have any questions
and I can clarify anything,

16:20.440 --> 16:22.602
I'll answer your questions.

16:27.080 --> 16:29.811
It seems it began in college.

16:30.040 --> 16:31.087
No.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.163
I was great in college.

16:33.320 --> 16:35.084
I did my best writing in college.

16:35.240 --> 16:37.766
I could write all night
and then go party with my friends.

16:37.920 --> 16:40.082
I mean, I had tons of friends.

16:40.240 --> 16:44.962
I mean, I had these incredibly deep
relationships with people.

16:45.120 --> 16:48.010
That was probably your illness surfacing.

16:49.560 --> 16:51.085
What?

16:51.280 --> 16:56.844
Sleeping less, being more personable,
more creative, wild.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.241
Those are the beginnings of the illness.

16:59.400 --> 17:02.165
You were just walking up to the edge.

17:03.680 --> 17:05.284
Do you recognize this?

17:10.920 --> 17:12.523
It's a poem you wrote.

17:12.680 --> 17:15.251
"Please, God, let me feel what you feel."

17:15.400 --> 17:19.769
I will stare up into the sky
with wide open eyes

17:19.920 --> 17:21.887
until you burn through my irises

17:22.040 --> 17:24.691
and touch my mind with your fire.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.847
- I went to the desert.
- Yeah.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.130
And you left this
on your desk before you went.

17:33.320 --> 17:37.166
And then you forced your eyes open
and stared into the sun.

17:42.200 --> 17:43.929
Is that what triggered it?

17:48.920 --> 17:51.526
Uh-uh-uh.
Uh-uh-uh.

18:01.680 --> 18:05.765
Hello, 911? I'm being held here
unlawfully at a police station...

18:07.320 --> 18:09.163
That was your one call.

18:09.320 --> 18:11.891
But I didn't call outside the station,
so it doesn't count.

18:12.880 --> 18:13.881
Hm.

18:14.040 --> 18:16.486
I don't belong here.
This is a hospital for sick people.

18:16.640 --> 18:18.369
I'm not sick.

18:18.520 --> 18:21.046
I can understand why you'd be here.
You look very sick to me.

18:21.240 --> 18:23.686
There's no life in your face.

18:23.840 --> 18:25.400
You look like you're about to tip over.

18:25.520 --> 18:28.967
And if you ask me, you know,
you don't need electroshock therapy.

18:29.120 --> 18:32.169
You need some jumper cables
attached to a Mack truck

18:32.320 --> 18:35.403
to latch to your face to light up
those dull eyes of yours.

18:35.560 --> 18:37.528
Do you think your mind
is sane right now?

18:37.720 --> 18:39.688
More than yours.

18:39.840 --> 18:45.609
Spreading messages in graffiti
about the end of the human race...

18:45.760 --> 18:47.603
that doesn't seem sane to me.

18:47.760 --> 18:51.128
Well, you're human, so you're biased.

18:53.920 --> 18:56.048
Do a lot of people read these messages?

18:56.200 --> 18:57.964
Everyone.

18:58.120 --> 19:00.600
Well, how do you know?

19:00.760 --> 19:02.967
Because of my online fan base.

19:03.760 --> 19:05.922
Would you mind showing that to me?

19:06.120 --> 19:07.121
Here.

19:19.760 --> 19:21.410
There. You see that?

19:21.560 --> 19:24.769
106 million people.

19:24.920 --> 19:30.609
No, see, that number is the number
of people in the entire network.

19:30.760 --> 19:36.369
Actually, only 119 people
have seen your page.

19:36.520 --> 19:37.931
- What?
- See?

19:44.040 --> 19:47.089
Marco, there's a lot of things
to figure out.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.209
Why don't you let me help you?

19:52.440 --> 19:54.727
Carla Lucia to check out.

19:54.920 --> 19:56.001
I'm sorry.

19:56.160 --> 19:58.083
You can't be released
until the doctors think you're okay.

19:58.240 --> 19:59.241
- What?
- You can have...

19:59.400 --> 20:03.041
No. I signed myself in voluntarily
last night.

20:03.200 --> 20:04.565
- Yes, I know, but...
- You can't keep me here.

20:04.760 --> 20:06.330
- You're still not allowed to be released...
- No, you can't keep...

20:06.480 --> 20:08.200
- Call my mom. Call her.
- She's on her way.

20:08.320 --> 20:10.084
Listen. She's on her way
with your clothes.

20:28.760 --> 20:31.127
- Good morning, Paul.
- It is a good morning.

20:31.280 --> 20:33.123
You know what would make a really
good morning, though?

20:33.280 --> 20:34.361
What?

20:34.520 --> 20:37.091
You slip some Adderall
into my cup instead of Seroquel,

20:37.240 --> 20:39.641
which is understandable
because it is kind of the same color.

20:39.840 --> 20:41.922
You know, especially
with pre-coffee eyesight?

20:42.080 --> 20:44.162
None of those cameras
are gonna see anything.

20:44.320 --> 20:46.200
And you don't have manic eyes,
know what I mean?

20:46.320 --> 20:49.483
Oh, yeah. I think the last thing
you need is Adderall.

20:52.280 --> 20:54.009
- Okay. Think about it.
- And, down.

20:54.160 --> 20:57.607
- Think about it for lunchtime.
- No. Let me see. Let's see.

20:57.760 --> 20:59.444
Thank you.

21:00.960 --> 21:04.123
This is the idea of the apocalypse,
is a new beginning.

21:04.320 --> 21:05.960
- Gary.
- Yes, but you don't understand...

21:06.000 --> 21:08.002
- What?
- I'm graduating you.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.168
What? That's great.

21:10.320 --> 21:11.481
How did...

21:11.640 --> 21:14.564
- That's... Hey, thanks, man.
- Hey.

21:14.720 --> 21:17.200
I'm just trying to tell you
what I see in the cards.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.283
Are we the first people to tell you
that you're gonna die?

21:19.440 --> 21:20.805
- No, but the fact that...
- I'm really sorry to be

21:20.960 --> 21:22.803
- the bearer of bad news.
- You're scaring him. Please stop.

21:22.960 --> 21:24.485
You don't have to shoot
the messenger here.

21:24.640 --> 21:26.768
Let's play some strip poker!

21:29.320 --> 21:32.051
All right, guys.

21:32.200 --> 21:36.250
We have two new people joining us today,
Emily and Marco.

21:36.440 --> 21:37.566
I go by Luna.

21:38.200 --> 21:39.850
Okay. This your nickname?

21:40.000 --> 21:41.047
It's my poet's name.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.646
Okay. Great.

21:45.320 --> 21:47.243
So, how's everyone feeling?

21:49.600 --> 21:51.360
All right, Gary,
why don't we start with you.

21:51.400 --> 21:53.448
What's on your mind this morning?

21:54.320 --> 21:56.209
The apocalypse.

21:56.360 --> 21:57.361
Okay.

21:57.520 --> 22:02.128
Do those sound
like rational or irrational fears?

22:02.280 --> 22:03.566
Anyone?

22:03.720 --> 22:05.165
Irrational.

22:05.320 --> 22:07.163
All right, Luna,

22:07.320 --> 22:10.529
tell Gary why his fears are irrational.

22:11.480 --> 22:12.720
Gary...

22:17.200 --> 22:19.202
you don't need to be
afraid of the apocalypse

22:19.400 --> 22:20.811
because...

22:22.040 --> 22:24.611
it's gonna happen,
no matter what.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.603
In fact, it's already happening.

22:26.760 --> 22:29.047
- Luna.
- What?

22:29.240 --> 22:30.526
The world's not going to end.

22:30.680 --> 22:33.524
Maybe not the world,
but the human race is.

22:33.680 --> 22:36.604
Gary, don't worry.
The human race isn't going to end.

22:36.760 --> 22:37.886
Of course it is.

22:38.080 --> 22:39.161
What, you think it's a coincidence

22:39.320 --> 22:42.483
that Nostradamus
and the Mayans both predicted that?

22:42.640 --> 22:45.086
No. They saw where
the planet was going.

22:45.240 --> 22:47.481
They saw everyone around
them cutting down more and more trees.

22:47.640 --> 22:50.211
They saw humanity becoming a disease.

22:50.360 --> 22:52.240
Do you know what
the definition of a disease is?

22:52.360 --> 22:55.125
It's when a single organism
becomes so overgrown

22:55.280 --> 22:56.611
that it's a menace to the whole.

22:56.760 --> 22:59.366
And do you know what happens
when a disease threatens

22:59.560 --> 23:01.722
the overall holistic balance in Nature?

23:01.880 --> 23:03.211
It develops antibodies.

23:03.400 --> 23:05.050
Okay, we're descending
into some place

23:05.200 --> 23:06.880
that we don't really need to go right now.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.440
I didn't mean anything by it.

23:08.480 --> 23:10.005
Well, you're upsetting Gary.

23:10.200 --> 23:13.204
Well, maybe now, but don't you think
that it's better in the long run

23:13.360 --> 23:15.727
- for him to know the truth?
- It's not the truth.

23:15.880 --> 23:19.771
Why don't you just apologize
to Gary for upsetting him?

23:23.600 --> 23:27.047
Gary, I'm sorry that I upset you.

23:27.200 --> 23:29.726
I didn't mean to scare you.

23:29.880 --> 23:31.689
There's nothing to be upset about

23:31.840 --> 23:36.243
because just think of it
like ridding the earth of a disease.

23:36.400 --> 23:37.640
Don't you want that?

23:40.200 --> 23:41.804
Don't you think that's a little selfish?

23:41.960 --> 23:43.325
- Luna.
- What?

23:43.520 --> 23:46.126
You were doing great.
You were doing great.

23:46.320 --> 23:47.765
Maybe you went a little far.

23:47.920 --> 23:50.366
How did I go...
That's why I'm apologizing.

23:50.520 --> 23:52.010
Okay, we're just trying to keep it simple.

23:52.200 --> 23:54.560
- That's why I'm apologizing.
- Yeah, just a simple apology.

23:54.680 --> 23:57.729
- You'll never graduate this way, Luna.
- What are you talking about?

23:57.880 --> 23:59.928
Yeah.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.683
- What is that?
- Those are the marks.

24:02.840 --> 24:05.969
There's still some more to learn,
I guess, isn't there?

24:06.120 --> 24:07.167
His thoughts are fine.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.129
Let's just imagine ourselves,
for a minute...

24:09.280 --> 24:10.281
I think it's okay to...

24:10.440 --> 24:14.126
- Everybody here knows how to share.
- Could you please just stop?

24:15.360 --> 24:17.160
You have an opinion
on what's being said here?

24:18.920 --> 24:20.206
It's your first day here,

24:20.360 --> 24:23.125
and you're alienating yourself
from the entire group.

24:23.280 --> 24:25.521
Are you saying
that I should hide what I think

24:25.680 --> 24:27.648
in order to become part of a group?

24:30.480 --> 24:31.481
No.

24:33.480 --> 24:35.881
Why are you looking at the group?

24:36.040 --> 24:38.361
- I'm not!
- Yeah, you are.

24:38.520 --> 24:39.521
Why are you lying?

24:39.680 --> 24:41.120
- I'm not lying!
- Why are you lying?

24:41.160 --> 24:42.366
- I'm not lying.
- Why are you lying?

24:42.520 --> 24:44.363
And it seems
we've reached an impasse.

24:44.520 --> 24:47.569
And we'll just take a couple of minutes
to cool down, three minutes,

24:47.720 --> 24:50.121
and we'll come back to the circle.
Okay?

24:50.280 --> 24:51.964
It's all right.
No touching, please.

24:58.640 --> 25:02.281
- Luna, why don't you color?
- Because I'm uninspired.

25:02.440 --> 25:04.721
Okay, why don't you take a look
at the books on the shelf.

25:04.840 --> 25:06.683
Maybe they'll give you
some inspiration.

25:11.880 --> 25:13.723
Here we go.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.120
Van Gogh.

25:15.320 --> 25:17.288
Top member of the Bipolar Club.

25:20.800 --> 25:21.926
You see this?

25:22.120 --> 25:23.610
- Yes, it's beautiful.
- Yeah, that's right.

25:23.760 --> 25:25.569
- You know why?
- Why?

25:25.720 --> 25:28.200
Because it's the painting
of the sky he saw

25:28.360 --> 25:31.204
from his sanitarium window
while he was manic.

25:31.360 --> 25:33.044
- Really?
- Yeah.

25:33.200 --> 25:34.804
You don't believe me?
Go look it up.

25:34.960 --> 25:35.961
I believe you.

25:36.120 --> 25:37.724
Well, when you go out tonight,

25:37.880 --> 25:40.247
and you look at the sky
and you see how dull it is,

25:40.400 --> 25:42.687
think about if you
would've medicated Van Gogh.

25:50.400 --> 25:51.401
Luna.

25:51.560 --> 25:53.289
What kind of poetry do you do?

25:53.440 --> 25:54.601
Rap.

25:54.760 --> 25:56.091
- You rap?
- Yeah.

25:56.280 --> 25:59.170
When I first went manic,
I just started rhyming compulsively,

25:59.320 --> 26:02.085
but, you know,
that's a textbook manic symptom.

26:02.240 --> 26:04.720
- Really?
- Yeah.

26:04.880 --> 26:07.008
You don't believe me?
Go look it up.

26:08.480 --> 26:09.686
Can you show us some?

26:11.240 --> 26:12.571
Give me a word.

26:13.480 --> 26:14.606
Anti-Christ.

26:19.200 --> 26:22.329
I fancy the delight...

26:24.680 --> 26:26.364
of what it might be like

26:26.560 --> 26:28.847
to be thought of as the Anti-Christ.

26:30.520 --> 26:32.170
Anti-body to humanity.

26:32.360 --> 26:34.203
Because, God damn it,

26:34.400 --> 26:36.562
if you handed me the planet,

26:36.720 --> 26:39.121
I'd give it such an apocalyptic rinse

26:39.320 --> 26:41.971
- that would rid it of these lice.
- How about shameless?

26:44.960 --> 26:47.008
I'm so shameless,

26:47.160 --> 26:49.527
I have no chains of shame to restrain

26:49.680 --> 26:51.921
what I do or say or think,

26:52.080 --> 26:54.970
afraid that people
might be ashamed of it.

26:55.120 --> 26:56.326
Alone.

27:00.080 --> 27:02.401
I may be alone,

27:02.560 --> 27:05.370
but at least I don't feel alone

27:05.560 --> 27:07.130
with the closest people I know

27:07.280 --> 27:09.931
because I changed myself
into something fake

27:10.080 --> 27:11.730
to gain the group's praise

27:11.880 --> 27:13.723
till I don't even know my own soul,

27:13.880 --> 27:14.961
which, if you ask me,

27:15.120 --> 27:17.441
is the loneliest state of being alone.

27:26.400 --> 27:27.686
Is that it?

27:29.280 --> 27:31.521
No more words?

27:31.680 --> 27:34.763
I see, you'd rather read that?
What is that, real poetry?

27:36.320 --> 27:37.321
Let's see.

27:37.480 --> 27:39.448
- Hey. Hey.
- Luna.

27:39.600 --> 27:42.251
"The sun shined as bright
as its flame could blaze..."

27:42.400 --> 27:43.481
- I'm getting the doctor!
- Okay! Okay!

27:43.680 --> 27:44.920
Oh! Oh-oh!

27:45.080 --> 27:47.970
- "Trying so hard each day to reach down..."
- Would you stop it!

27:48.120 --> 27:50.122
- "And touch each face."
- Stop it!

27:50.280 --> 27:54.649
"But they all turned away,
bitterly squinting, wincing,"

27:54.800 --> 27:57.610
so no matter how much it reached out
to the human race,

27:57.760 --> 28:01.526
"it knew it would always be estranged."

28:39.640 --> 28:42.644
We are all bipolar.
Sometimes it's like a molar.

28:42.800 --> 28:45.371
You wanna take it out,
you want to be better.

28:45.520 --> 28:47.045
So, don't sweat the weather.

28:47.240 --> 28:48.526
Check out the solar power.

28:48.680 --> 28:49.806
It's the rhyming hour.

28:49.960 --> 28:52.770
The first card is the symbol cradle.

28:52.960 --> 28:55.281
Don't worry, it's the symbol of life,
nothing fatal.

28:55.440 --> 28:58.649
I'm gonna strap you down and stick
one of these nurses' syringes into you.

28:58.840 --> 28:59.921
That doesn't rhyme.

29:00.080 --> 29:03.402
Don't even stop to think about it.
Just let it all go. You be the vessel.

29:03.560 --> 29:05.130
Okay, that's where
the best stuff just happens.

29:05.280 --> 29:07.044
Just let it in and spit it out.

29:07.200 --> 29:09.407
But good, though.

29:09.600 --> 29:11.568
- You graduated, Luna.
- What?

29:18.840 --> 29:20.649
You're one level higher. Yeah.

29:28.960 --> 29:31.531
- Couldn't sleep?
- No.

29:31.680 --> 29:34.729
- Want something to help?
- No, I'm just gonna go to the art room.

30:07.880 --> 30:09.086
Can't sleep?

30:11.400 --> 30:12.401
No.

30:31.600 --> 30:33.204
So Emily,

30:33.360 --> 30:36.045
can I ask you
what your full fake name is?

30:38.920 --> 30:41.002
Emily Lowell.

30:41.160 --> 30:43.481
Is that Emily Dickinson
and Robert Lowell?

30:47.040 --> 30:49.088
Those are good poets.

30:51.800 --> 30:53.200
Do you know they were both bipolar?

30:53.280 --> 30:56.807
You think every great artist was bipolar.

30:58.160 --> 30:59.650
It's fine if it helps you.

31:01.400 --> 31:03.482
"We of the craft are all crazy..."

31:05.080 --> 31:09.722
"Some are affected by gaiety,
others with melancholy."

31:12.320 --> 31:15.403
"But all are more or less touched."

31:15.600 --> 31:16.886
You know who said that?

31:19.520 --> 31:21.124
Lord Byron.

31:22.600 --> 31:26.571
One of the greatest
manic-depressive poets of all time.

31:28.840 --> 31:34.324
It's in the opening to this book,
<i>Touched with Fire</i> by Kay Jamison.

31:34.480 --> 31:37.131
She's a psychologist,

31:37.280 --> 31:42.161
and when she was first starting out,

31:42.320 --> 31:47.850
she, out of nowhere,
had this manic episode.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.571
It scared her.

31:50.760 --> 31:53.286
So she tried to keep it a secret.

31:55.120 --> 31:58.727
But then... something changed.

31:59.440 --> 32:02.205
She decided to write books about it.

32:02.360 --> 32:05.762
She did all this research, and she found
all these crazy connections

32:05.920 --> 32:09.083
between bipolar and artistic genius

32:09.280 --> 32:12.443
all through history,
all over the world.

32:12.600 --> 32:15.251
Instead of being ashamed of it...

32:17.520 --> 32:21.684
she made it a gift.

32:23.960 --> 32:26.531
You know, when people go
to see <i>The Nutcracker...</i>

32:28.240 --> 32:31.005
and they look over at their kids
and they see their eyes light up

32:31.160 --> 32:34.960
when the world
turns to magic at night...

32:36.440 --> 32:40.126
they'll know that the music
that Tchaikovsky composed

32:40.280 --> 32:44.808
was enriched by his bipolar,
and not think of it as just a disease.

32:49.400 --> 32:51.004
When I look at the river, I mean,

32:51.160 --> 32:53.367
that's a symbol for two things
coming together.

32:53.520 --> 32:57.411
That could be the end of a journey,
or two people.

32:58.560 --> 32:59.607
Anything else?

32:59.760 --> 33:02.286
Well, I mean, you can have more
if you want more.

33:02.440 --> 33:03.680
There's a house.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.241
Yeah, Luna,
I just told Emily's fortune.

33:08.400 --> 33:10.243
Huh?

33:10.400 --> 33:12.448
- Come on, I want to hear yours.
- Put 'em together.

33:12.600 --> 33:14.045
- Take a seat.
- What?

33:14.200 --> 33:15.929
She wants to read your cards.

33:21.120 --> 33:23.202
She got a moon.

33:23.360 --> 33:25.010
You got a moon?

33:26.280 --> 33:27.566
That's interesting.

33:28.720 --> 33:30.722
She got two rivers meeting.

33:32.160 --> 33:33.525
Why is it interesting?

33:35.520 --> 33:38.967
You know that we're made up
of mostly water?

33:39.160 --> 33:41.083
And the moon pulls water.

33:41.240 --> 33:44.562
Well, that's just the sun that does that.
I just reflect it.

33:44.720 --> 33:46.609
But when the sun's down,
we see the moon.

33:46.760 --> 33:47.761
That's the light.

33:47.960 --> 33:50.088
That's true, but that's just
the light from the sun

33:50.240 --> 33:53.244
hitting the moon, shining back.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.880
Couldn't sleep again?

34:17.040 --> 34:18.041
No.

34:21.199 --> 34:22.201
Well, that's weird.

34:22.360 --> 34:24.567
It's the same time as last night.

34:25.360 --> 34:27.089
Must be something to do with the moon.

34:28.199 --> 34:30.123
Why did you name yourself Luna?

34:31.560 --> 34:34.530
Because the lunatic looks
to the moon as if asking it

34:34.679 --> 34:36.330
how he got stuck down here.

34:40.360 --> 34:42.328
<i>Where are you from?</i>

34:42.480 --> 34:46.371
<i>Yeah, I know you're from the moon,
but what about your parents?</i>

34:46.560 --> 34:48.880
<i>My father's from here.</i>

34:49.040 --> 34:51.281
<i>My mother's from where I'm from.</i>

34:51.480 --> 34:53.322
She used to wake me
in the middle of the night

34:53.480 --> 34:55.608
and take me out to look at the stars.

34:55.760 --> 34:59.367
Imagine jumping
from star to star to star.

35:01.240 --> 35:02.480
And your dad?

35:04.400 --> 35:06.368
He falls with most dads.

35:06.520 --> 35:11.765
They don't like to see their girls...
struggle.

35:11.960 --> 35:13.166
So...

35:15.720 --> 35:17.961
I don't see him much.

35:18.120 --> 35:21.806
I guess...
I guess I make him sad.

35:26.840 --> 35:28.524
We're not from here, you and me.

35:31.160 --> 35:32.491
Feels like that.

35:34.400 --> 35:35.680
How'd you get stuck here?

35:37.000 --> 35:38.286
It's embarrassing.

35:42.080 --> 35:45.323
- Tell you, if you tell me.
- Okay, you tell me first.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.047
Okay.

35:47.200 --> 35:51.330
You forced your eyes opened,
and stared into the sun.

35:51.480 --> 35:53.050
Is that what triggered it?

35:53.200 --> 35:55.646
You know what?

35:55.840 --> 35:58.002
We're both really exhausted.

35:58.160 --> 36:00.003
I know I am.

36:00.160 --> 36:02.925
There's no way that we're going
to get through all this tonight.

36:03.960 --> 36:08.045
You should spend the night,
and first thing in the morning,

36:08.200 --> 36:10.487
we'll go over all of this in detail.

36:10.640 --> 36:13.405
Sign this and check yourself in,

36:13.560 --> 36:18.122
and we will do a thorough
examination of your case

36:18.320 --> 36:20.084
first thing in the morning.

36:20.280 --> 36:22.640
You accidentally checked yourself
into a mental institution?

36:22.760 --> 36:23.886
- Just for one night.
- No.

36:24.040 --> 36:25.724
For one night.

36:30.040 --> 36:33.123
- It's not that funny.
- It's stupid.

36:33.280 --> 36:35.362
Okay.

36:35.520 --> 36:37.010
Now it's your turn.

36:40.400 --> 36:42.846
I climbed to the top of a building.

36:50.720 --> 36:52.210
I looked up to the moon...

36:54.200 --> 36:56.248
asking it to take me home.

37:00.800 --> 37:04.521
And all of a sudden...

37:05.560 --> 37:10.202
I felt this light shining on my face.

37:11.800 --> 37:13.564
And I thought,
"My God."

37:16.280 --> 37:17.645
It's working.

37:20.440 --> 37:22.966
"I get to go home."

37:25.440 --> 37:27.204
And...

37:48.360 --> 37:49.407
Know what?

37:51.600 --> 37:52.931
You know, maybe...

37:57.680 --> 38:00.923
Maybe you're right.

38:05.240 --> 38:08.164
I mean, maybe we are aliens.

38:09.160 --> 38:10.685
You, too?

38:11.840 --> 38:13.126
Maybe.

38:21.240 --> 38:25.131
Lunatic mind ticks in sync
with lunar time.

38:25.320 --> 38:28.802
The more the moon pulls the tides,
the more it lifts our minds,

38:28.960 --> 38:30.803
and the more the sunlight
shines on the moon,

38:30.960 --> 38:32.405
the more manic we become.

38:50.840 --> 38:54.481
This is a normal brain,
lit up just in a few places.

38:54.680 --> 38:59.129
But this, this is a manic brain,
fully lit.

38:59.280 --> 39:00.964
That's what you call illumination.

39:03.960 --> 39:05.325
- It's the sages.
- I know.

39:05.480 --> 39:09.246
It's the prophets through the ages
who know about the gods.

39:09.400 --> 39:12.722
The prophets, when they were manic,
that was when

39:12.880 --> 39:15.406
they were almost reaching
full illumination.

39:15.560 --> 39:17.289
And that was right before they died.

39:17.440 --> 39:19.090
That's the 13th hour.
That's what you're talking about.

39:19.240 --> 39:20.924
- Right, that's what I'm saying.
- That's illumination.

39:21.080 --> 39:23.003
Look at these pyramids.

39:23.160 --> 39:24.200
They all face the heavens.

39:24.320 --> 39:27.608
This is intricate cosmic mapping,
ways out.

39:27.800 --> 39:29.643
These all have to do with escaping

39:29.840 --> 39:32.286
to somehow getting out
of the body, this flesh...

39:32.440 --> 39:35.683
Well, they did find certain stones,
metals, that absorb energy.

39:36.280 --> 39:38.089
And the metals absorb the heavens

39:38.240 --> 39:40.242
reaching up to the tip
of the pyramid to the sun,

39:40.440 --> 39:41.965
inviting its light in.

39:52.960 --> 39:54.962
Yes, yeah, put it in.

39:56.280 --> 39:57.441
Silverware, silverware.

39:57.600 --> 39:59.489
Yeah, we need a transmitter.

40:00.760 --> 40:03.001
- These are for the antenna?
- Yeah.

40:03.160 --> 40:04.969
They'll get out, yeah.

40:12.280 --> 40:14.965
That's not gonna work.
What can we use?

40:17.960 --> 40:19.530
Use this.

40:19.680 --> 40:21.011
Stick it in there.

40:21.160 --> 40:23.049
I don't know if these things
are strong enough.

40:23.480 --> 40:24.720
There are four sides to each pyramid.

40:24.880 --> 40:26.600
This is a view from...
of the third pyramid.

40:26.720 --> 40:28.210
The three pyramids,
four sides to each one.

40:28.400 --> 40:30.129
There is 12.

40:30.320 --> 40:31.845
- 12 months.
- 2012.

40:32.000 --> 40:34.162
- 12 hours.
- 12 apostles.

40:36.960 --> 40:42.490
Dr. Strinsky doesn't want you two
coming out at night anymore.

40:43.200 --> 40:44.964
So...

40:54.600 --> 40:57.331
Could I have something
to help me sleep?

41:25.040 --> 41:28.442
No reaction.
You know what?

41:28.600 --> 41:31.206
The more down-to-earth they are,
the deeper they sleep.

41:31.360 --> 41:33.203
Okay. Don't wait, then.

42:04.640 --> 42:07.803
- Okay, no. Yeah.
- I'm going to stretch that over.

42:22.200 --> 42:24.009
What if our souls get lost?

42:24.160 --> 42:25.525
They won't.

42:26.360 --> 42:28.727
We'll keep each other oriented.

42:34.080 --> 42:35.730
What if we lose each other?

42:38.040 --> 42:40.884
If we lose each other,
then we come back to our bodies.

42:41.040 --> 42:43.930
Okay, we come back to our bodies,
and we remember this.

42:44.120 --> 42:46.122
We remember this map.
Okay?

42:46.280 --> 42:48.203
And we remember it's in this book.

42:48.360 --> 42:51.250
And it'll be on this page, all right?

42:58.920 --> 43:02.322
And it'll be right here
in the top right corner.

43:02.480 --> 43:03.811
Okay?

43:10.280 --> 43:11.566
Are you ready?

43:16.120 --> 43:17.531
Yeah.

43:37.960 --> 43:41.885
The nurses tell me you two have
continued to stay up at night together

43:42.040 --> 43:44.008
even after I instructed you not to.

43:44.920 --> 43:47.446
First reports say you
stayed up until 4:00 A. M.

43:47.640 --> 43:50.723
And the more recent reports
say you haven't slept at all.

43:50.880 --> 43:53.929
So, we're going to move you,
Marco, to a different ward.

43:54.080 --> 43:56.082
- Why?
- Because you have a bad influence...

43:56.240 --> 43:57.605
- But, why?
- No, we don't.

43:57.760 --> 43:59.922
Is it true that neither of you
thinks you're from this planet?

44:00.080 --> 44:02.401
Because we're not from this planet.

44:02.560 --> 44:04.881
Okay, sit.
Where do you think you're from?

44:05.040 --> 44:08.522
- Would someone from your planet do this?
- Marco. Sit down.

44:08.680 --> 44:11.047
- You know what? You can't separate...
- Would someone from your planet do that?

44:11.200 --> 44:12.804
That's not fair.

44:13.000 --> 44:15.048
- Would they?
- Fuck you!

44:15.200 --> 44:16.520
- Don't you go near her.
- N-N-No!

44:16.560 --> 44:17.607
Marco! Marco!

44:17.800 --> 44:19.450
- Fuck you!
- No, Marco! No!

44:22.320 --> 44:24.209
No! No!

44:24.360 --> 44:27.125
- Get them off!
- No, you motherfucker!

44:35.480 --> 44:39.121
Hold her...

44:57.560 --> 44:59.085
No!

44:59.240 --> 45:00.844
No!

45:07.400 --> 45:09.767
Let us go home!

45:09.920 --> 45:12.810
Please, let us go home!

45:13.640 --> 45:14.880
We just want to go home.

45:26.640 --> 45:28.369
Why is he so sedated?

45:29.520 --> 45:31.240
He was with a female patient,

45:31.320 --> 45:33.561
and they made each other manic.

45:33.720 --> 45:37.406
We separated them and they
became even more manic.

45:39.280 --> 45:41.009
How long is he going to be like that?

45:42.520 --> 45:44.887
It's not just the medication.

45:45.040 --> 45:50.046
Because the mania got so
out of control and he went so high,

45:50.200 --> 45:53.249
he's going to go just as low
with the depression.

45:54.600 --> 45:56.170
It's going to be severe.

45:56.760 --> 45:59.570
It'll be about six months.

45:59.720 --> 46:03.884
We would keep him here,
but the hospital just can't afford it.

46:05.040 --> 46:07.566
I suggest that he live with you
for a while.

47:58.840 --> 48:01.844
Wake up.
Made you dinner.

48:04.680 --> 48:06.091
Taken a shower?

48:31.920 --> 48:33.001
Just take a bath?

48:34.280 --> 48:35.327
Yeah.

48:35.480 --> 48:38.131
Didn't you take one,
like, four hours ago?

48:39.200 --> 48:40.565
It's the same one.

48:40.720 --> 48:43.451
You've been in the tub for four hours?

48:45.600 --> 48:46.931
It comforts me.

49:35.920 --> 49:36.921
Oh.

49:38.120 --> 49:39.485
I didn't see you there.

49:41.480 --> 49:42.686
How you feelin'?

49:43.560 --> 49:44.766
Same.

50:34.120 --> 50:36.088
Meet me on the other side.

52:32.520 --> 52:33.931
<i>What if we lose each other?</i>

52:35.040 --> 52:37.805
<i>If we lose each other,
then we come back to our bodies.</i>

52:37.960 --> 52:40.930
<i>Okay, we come back to our bodies,
and we remember this.</i>

52:41.080 --> 52:42.889
<i>We remember this map, okay?</i>

53:16.160 --> 53:18.000
Yo, yo, I got another joke.
I got another joke.

53:21.120 --> 53:23.805
I was a patient here,
back in the fall.

53:23.960 --> 53:26.122
There was this girl who was in my ward.

53:26.280 --> 53:28.169
I don't have her contact information.

53:28.320 --> 53:31.688
Yeah, we can't give out
patient's information,

53:31.840 --> 53:33.968
for confidentiality reasons.

53:35.800 --> 53:37.290
Is Dr. Strinsky here?

53:39.520 --> 53:40.885
Hey, Carla.

53:42.080 --> 53:43.570
Hey.

53:47.440 --> 53:50.842
Listen, I know it's hospital policy

53:51.040 --> 53:53.122
not to give out patient's information,

53:53.280 --> 53:55.726
but if you hadn't torn us apart,

53:55.920 --> 53:57.809
we would've exchanged information.

53:59.640 --> 54:04.009
I'm sorry, but no matter what,
it's out of my hands.

54:11.240 --> 54:13.607
Will you at least tell me
if he came looking for me?

54:16.320 --> 54:18.209
No, he didn't.

54:19.440 --> 54:20.805
Marco.

54:20.960 --> 54:23.964
I already told you,
I'm not giving you her information.

54:24.120 --> 54:26.327
Okay. Can you just give her this,
if she comes in?

54:26.480 --> 54:27.925
Let me see.

54:41.840 --> 54:43.649
I'm sorry.
I'm not going to give this to her.

54:43.840 --> 54:45.604
But that's not personal information.

54:45.800 --> 54:47.689
That's not against hospital policy.

54:47.840 --> 54:50.127
It's not just policy, Marco.

54:50.280 --> 54:51.520
You two made each other manic

54:51.720 --> 54:53.240
when you were together
in the hospital.

54:53.360 --> 54:55.727
It's my professional opinion

54:55.880 --> 54:57.689
that you're not healthy
for one another.

54:57.840 --> 55:01.811
Have a seat.
I'll tell Dr. Strinsky that you're back.

56:02.120 --> 56:04.726
What did you think...

56:04.920 --> 56:06.649
seeing it up close?

56:06.840 --> 56:08.763
I thought it was...

56:08.920 --> 56:10.001
It was cool.

56:11.200 --> 56:12.531
What did you think?

56:14.720 --> 56:16.006
I thought it was nice.

56:20.960 --> 56:22.689
You didn't like it, did you?

56:24.240 --> 56:26.208
I guess I just...

56:27.120 --> 56:28.690
It wasn't...

56:39.120 --> 56:41.964
Do you remember what this looked like
when we were in the hospital?

57:44.600 --> 57:46.648
You've just come out of the depression.

57:46.800 --> 57:51.283
You haven't been in a physical relationship
for quite a while.

57:51.440 --> 57:53.522
- It's understandable.
- No, it's not just that.

57:53.680 --> 57:57.446
I don't feel the emotion
that I should feel for her.

57:57.600 --> 58:01.207
Well, you won't have the passion you had
when you were manic.

58:01.360 --> 58:04.364
You're going to have to learn to live
within a normal range of emotions.

58:04.520 --> 58:06.568
This isn't a normal range.

58:07.720 --> 58:09.609
I don't feel anything.

58:11.000 --> 58:15.847
You've lived in emotional extremes
for so long,

58:16.000 --> 58:18.401
you've no way of knowing
what normal feels like.

58:19.520 --> 58:22.000
And it's going to take you
some time to learn.

58:24.160 --> 58:25.764
Okay. Okay.

58:30.480 --> 58:32.369
I've been calling.
Why didn't you pick up?

58:32.520 --> 58:34.010
I'm sorry...

58:34.160 --> 58:36.367
You know, I'm still not comfortable
with you living on your own.

58:36.520 --> 58:37.760
So that might worry me a little bit.

58:37.920 --> 58:39.251
- Mom...
- What, you're...

58:39.400 --> 58:41.402
Do you think maybe I could come
and visit you tomorrow?

58:41.560 --> 58:42.971
You're not going to let me come in?

58:43.160 --> 58:45.049
Well, I'm just...
Well, I'm...

58:45.200 --> 58:46.531
- You know how...
- Please, sweetie, I just...

58:46.680 --> 58:49.286
just let me in
or I'm not going to sleep tonight.

58:51.600 --> 58:53.329
- Mom...
- Oh.

58:53.480 --> 58:55.642
- Hello.
- Hello.

58:55.840 --> 58:57.410
Who's that?

58:58.400 --> 58:59.731
Come on in.

59:01.840 --> 59:04.446
Marco, this is my mom.

59:04.640 --> 59:05.801
- Hello.
- Mom, this is Marco.

59:05.960 --> 59:07.291
Hello.

59:07.480 --> 59:09.562
- Wow. Very nice to meet you.
- Hi.

59:09.720 --> 59:10.960
Nice to meet you.

59:12.080 --> 59:15.004
We were just reading
<i>Touched with Fire.</i>

59:15.160 --> 59:17.288
- It's a great book. Do you know it?
- No.

59:17.440 --> 59:18.965
Really?
Carla never told you about it?

59:19.120 --> 59:22.203
No. So how do you two
know each other?

59:22.360 --> 59:23.964
- Oh...
- He's a poet.

59:27.840 --> 59:29.251
Um...

59:30.000 --> 59:31.650
I'm hungry.

59:31.800 --> 59:33.609
Do you guys want to
go get some food?

59:33.760 --> 59:35.967
- I'd love that.
- Great.

59:36.120 --> 59:37.531
I'm not really hungry.

59:37.680 --> 59:39.170
Well, at least come along
for the conversation.

59:39.320 --> 59:40.401
You don't have to eat.

59:40.560 --> 59:43.131
If anything, your mouth
will be more free to talk.

59:43.280 --> 59:44.520
Do you like spicy food?

59:44.720 --> 59:47.963
I don't know. Maybe.

59:48.120 --> 59:50.600
- I know this place that has a really...
- You know, I'm tired.

59:50.680 --> 59:53.081
Oh, really?
Why do you think you're tired?

59:53.240 --> 59:55.208
I kinda just want to stay in.

59:55.400 --> 59:58.165
Okay. Well, maybe
we could pick up something

59:58.360 --> 59:59.521
for you and bring it back.

59:59.680 --> 01:00:02.365
No, I just... I'll come back
another time if you're tired.

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:04.284
Are you ashamed of me?

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:06.010
- What?
- Are you ashamed of me?

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:08.089
No. What are you talking about?

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:09.605
Why didn't you tell her?

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:13.965
I don't know.

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:22.881
I guess I'm just afraid of...
of them tearing us apart.

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:24.883
They can't tear us apart.

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:30.524
We have to tell them.

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:34.321
Okay.

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:36.488
So, I just...

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:40.122
I want to orient myself,
if you don't mind.

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:44.803
My wife, you know, Sara,
had updated me a little

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:46.803
on the background
of the situation.

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:50.760
You met Carla in the hospital?

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:56.051
- That's right.
- We met in, well, group therapy.

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:59.363
They... We have to do
group therapy every day.

01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:01.568
That's nice that you were able
to connect in that environment.

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.046
Yeah, absolutely.

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:05.965
And, but right...

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:10.364
This was right before
you both went manic.

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:16.005
When you have this illness, you...

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:19.369
actually go manic
before you go into the hospital, Dad.

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:21.522
Oh, of course.
Well, that's true.

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:24.286
I'm sorry. No, I meant the...
but right after you met,

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:26.488
then what would we say,
you went more manic.

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:28.483
- More.
- It did increase, is it...

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:31.371
Well, we brought out each other's nature,
if that's what you're driving at.

01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:33.600
- So you...
- I guess that's one way of putting it...

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:36.763
You admit that you
bring out each other's illness, right?

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:41.443
No, I'm saying that it's our nature
to feel things more deeply

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:43.204
than what's considered normal.

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:44.805
And not...
That's really not what...

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:48.407
I understand it,
that it's sort of not a norm.

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:50.040
I understand that it's an illness...

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:52.891
I don't think
we should get caught up, if I may,

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:55.725
just on whether it's a disease
or nature or something.

01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:57.962
I think the point is,
and the reason we're here,

01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:00.805
is, you both have it,

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:04.043
and I guess we're just concerned

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:06.208
that you might be
a bad influence on each other.

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:07.407
That's it.

01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:10.211
Well, but because we both share it,

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:13.330
we're the only ones
that can relate to each other.

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:15.289
It's beautiful.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.010
Well, I understand that.

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:18.730
Excuse me,
but you understand that?

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:20.729
The doct... remember,
the doctors told us?

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:23.161
I mean, let's face it.

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:25.846
You know, if they signed up
for a dating website,

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.445
you know,
and they put down "mentally ill,"

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:30.001
it's not like they're going to attract
a whole lot of people saying,

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:32.481
"Oh, that's my soul mate."
Right?

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:37.242
Maybe this is a chance
for them to have a real relationship.

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:40.603
You know, and if they stay
on the medication,

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:42.205
quite frankly,
I got no problem with that.

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:43.760
But that's the whole issue, right?

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:45.569
Mom, can you just listen to him?

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:47.404
- We can't take the meds.
- Mom, just... just listen...

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:49.801
Okay, well, just as I thought.

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:51.724
- What are you talking about?
- You know what I'm talking about.

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:55.168
Marco, listen.
You know that it's going to take time

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:57.721
till you find the right dosage, right?

01:02:57.880 --> 01:02:59.564
Even the doctor,
the doctor has said

01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:02.644
that eventually you are going to feel

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:04.569
the wide range of normal emotions.

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:06.609
And how does he know?
He's not taking the meds.

01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:08.880
The doctor does not take the meds,
and you know that.

01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:10.530
So, then I can't just trust him.

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:13.610
I don't think it's such a bad thing

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:17.082
to feel life with the deepest emotion.

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:19.891
- I don't think that's a problem.
- It's an illness.

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:21.201
Well, maybe for you,

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:23.280
because maybe you
have a low emotional capacity,

01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:25.203
and so to you,
it makes you feel sick.

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:26.970
No, I don't have...
Wait a minute.

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:29.361
- I don't have a low emotional capacity.
- Wait, it's not an attack.

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:31.204
- I feel things just fine.
- I'm sorry. I understand.

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:33.522
- Mom, you don't have to get upset.
- I don't... My only question...

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:35.364
Well, how dare he say that.

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:38.524
- Okay, as an example, if you...
- He's just talking.

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:40.842
like, how many hours do you spend
a week with your husband?

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:42.530
- Oh, my God.
- This is really not gonna...

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:43.841
this is not about us, again.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.049
- As many hours as any married...
- I'd like to answer that.

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:49.043
- Okay.
- We spend many hours a week together.

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:51.407
I would spend every waking moment

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:52.561
- with your daughter.
- Okay. I...

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:56.048
So you mean, insanity is love,

01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:59.522
that you have to be crazy to be in love?
Is that what you're saying?

01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:02.604
That's not what I'm saying.
You don't understand, Dad.

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:05.001
I understand more than you know.

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:09.370
And if you think that there's
any romance in being crazy,

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:11.090
you're crazy.

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:14.807
No, if you understood,
then Mom wouldn't have left.

01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:21.404
Your mother,
she left because she was sick.

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:24.769
She left because
you thought she was sick,

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:26.962
because she was wild.

01:04:27.120 --> 01:04:31.569
And you were tame,
and you wanted to tame her, Dad.

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:33.842
- So where is her love now?
- Dad.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.047
No, really, where is it?

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:37.680
When was the last time
you heard from your mother?

01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:41.724
- Excuse me.
- Oh, my God.

01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:50.806
You can't listen to him.
He's wrong. You know that.

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:52.962
This is not a gift.
It's an illness.

01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:54.884
It needs to be treated.

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:56.371
I've gotten you
through so much, honey.

01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:59.683
You have to trust me right now
because sometimes your illness

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:02.810
doesn't let you think completely clearly.
But you've gotta believe me.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.520
- Carla, please don't...
- Don't be upset now, come on.

01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:11.967
<i>"We awoke from our sleep
and left our sanity beside our bed,"</i>

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:16.607
<i>peeled off those sedative sheets...</i>

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:19.491
<i>released our eyelids' grip
on their protective lens...</i>

01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:24.366
<i>and let the whole miracle in
against all defense,</i>

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:26.841
<i>past the shattering glass.</i>

01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:37.288
<i>God, grant us that view...</i>

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:40.962
<i>"and all its blindness due. "</i>

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:09.405
What is that?

01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:36.923
<i>"A child to rise
from our fiery seeds,</i>

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:41.051
<i>that burned across our bloodlines
for lifetimes, to finally meet. "</i>

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:42.929
<i>"And find a face for the first time"</i>

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:46.607
<i>in the reflection
between our locked eyes.</i>

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:50.242
<i>"And in their vision,
in a sudden flash of recognition"</i>

01:09:50.399 --> 01:09:52.880
<i>of our place in the Grand Design,</i>

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:56.766
<i>"our child will be let
into the gates of creation. "</i>

01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:59.531
<i>"Touched with both our fires,</i>

01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:02.365
<i>to burn twice as high as you and I. "</i>

01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:07.048
Hey, Marco,
let's give our baby this book

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:10.204
so that when he starts to know
what he has,

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:12.124
he's gonna know the beauty in it.

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:16.886
Hello!

01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:20.408
- Hey, how are you?
- Joe!

01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:22.324
Okay, thanks.

01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:25.370
Is Marco here?
I'm his father.

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:27.841
Oh, no.
I haven't seen him in weeks.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.729
- Weeks?
- Yeah.

01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:30.961
Okay.

01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:46.491
I'm going to see what she wants.

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:52.050
Hey, Mom.

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:56.164
Uh, actually, we're busy.

01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:58.163
<i>Oh, really, because I wouldjust...</i>

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:00.607
<i>I would love to just get together
with you and Marco</i>

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:03.604
<i>and hear about
what you guys are doing.</i>

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:05.569
<i>You know, just clear the air.</i>

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:12.007
- I don't know, Mom...
- <i>Honey, I really...</i>

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:13.804
<i>I really want to work things out.
I do.</i>

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:16.850
<i>I just... I don't want to
not see you because of this.</i>

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:20.807
<i>You know, I don't want to lose you
for stupid reasons.</i>

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.684
Neither do I.

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:36.770
- Hi, Marco.
- Hello.

01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:37.967
- How are you?
- Hi, Marco.

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:39.770
- Good, how are you?
- Good.

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:41.684
- Hi, Marco.
- Hello.

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.126
- How you doing?
- Are you guys hungry?

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:44.964
- We have some...
- Oh, you've left the door open.

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:46.770
I'll get that. I'll get that.
It's not important.

01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:48.570
- Yeah.
- Wait a minute.

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:50.802
What are you...
What's he doing here?

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:53.566
- Oh, we invited him.
- What are you doing here?

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:55.609
- Why? You weren't...
- We love you,

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:57.603
- and we want what's best for you.
- What's going on?

01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:58.920
- I brought some people.
- No.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.001
- No! Stop!
- It's fine.

01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:02.120
- No, he doesn't get to come in here.
- Calm down.

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:03.730
- It's okay.
- N-N-No. Stop!

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:05.251
He doesn't get to come in here!

01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:06.845
Marco, just calm down, okay?

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.731
You're a danger to yourself
and to others.

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:11.166
You guys need help, okay?

01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:13.084
You're off your meds
and you're manic.

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:16.084
- You need help.
- No! Fucking, no!

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:17.924
Dad, you fucked me!

01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:19.320
You can't fucking do it.

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:22.240
- Your family loves you...
- Dad, I will never fucking forgive you.

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:23.406
I will never...

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:25.164
- You fucking sold me down the river.
- I'm sorry.

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:28.443
very much.
Take a breath, Marco.

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:30.682
Okay, no, you're right.

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:35.209
It's okay. All right?

01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:37.886
- Hey.
- We'll go, okay?

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:43.171
- Hey, sweetie.
- It's really okay.

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:44.960
- It's going to be fine.
- Don't touch me.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.286
- No, no, Carla.
- Okay, sweetie, I understand.

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.329
No! No!

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:49.686
No, don't!

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:53.129
Fucker!

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:20.926
We have to go away.

01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:23.691
If they find us,
they'll stop us from having our child.

01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:27.524
They won't want us to bring
a child like us into the world.

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:33.130
I understand.

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:37.245
Well, could you let me know
if you hear anything at all?

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:39.926
Thanks so much.
I was really worried.

01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:47.491
This way.

01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:54.447
<i>We should go into the wild
where they can't find us.</i>

01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:58.122
<i>We can raise a child there.</i>

01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:00.806
<i>He won't have to grow up going
through what we went through.</i>

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.481
<i>He'll be free to live
the way he was made to be.</i>

01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:38.442
<i>This is the place.</i>

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:40.841
<i>This is the place we'll raise our child.</i>

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:45.121
<i>Everything around him just as wild.</i>

01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:32.924
Oh, shit.

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:41.725
What are we gonna do?

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:47.927
- I'm gonna drive in the river.
- What?

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:51.201
We'll have Nature's support.

01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:09.406
I got you.

01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:01.571
First of all, I'd like to say
that we were very fortunate

01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:04.331
to catch things as early as we did.

01:17:04.480 --> 01:17:07.927
That's especially true
in light of today's news.

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:10.769
Carla's pregnant.

01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:14.845
And I want everyone here
to know that myself

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.446
and the staff here at the hospital
are prepared to do

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:20.809
everything that we possibly can
to help her and Marco

01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:23.725
in their transition to the outside world.

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:26.722
Wow, I really want to be
happy about this,

01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:28.450
but I'm sorry, I can't.

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:29.647
I can't be.

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:34.124
We promise that
we're both gonna take our medication.

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:37.443
We're both responsible in the situation.

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:40.126
You know,
my daughter means everything to me.

01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:42.487
And I would help you to get a job.

01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:44.688
Thank you.

01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:51.242
- You have your interview tomorrow, right?
- Yeah.

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:52.840
You know, I was thinking about that.

01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:55.201
Do you know what
I was thinking would be cool?

01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:59.644
Maybe I could walk dogs.

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:01.689
I'd be out there,
I'd be working, you know?

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:03.842
I'd be, the same time,
taking everything in,

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.889
the sounds, the trees,

01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:08.008
the buildings, the...
just all of it,

01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:10.282
sort of just absorbing all of that,
and then like,

01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:14.604
letting that sort of be infused
into my poetry, you know?

01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:16.330
We did tell our parents

01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:18.323
that we were going to try
to support ourselves with...

01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:21.529
Exactly. And that's why
I'm thinking of things to do.

01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:24.889
I mean, I just don't know
how much you would get paid.

01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:28.965
With the baby we're going to have
diapers and blankets

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:33.284
and food and supplies and school

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:37.161
and strollers and the rent
and, you know,

01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:39.846
- play dates with birthday parties...
- Okay, okay.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.729
- I mean, it's just gonna...
- Okay. Okay.

01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:43.450
- You know?
- I know.

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:45.284
You're right.

01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:07.127
She's like the cutest
little roly-poly thing ever.

01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:08.440
- Just want to eat her.
- Wow.

01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:10.164
She's like a...

01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:30.526
Hey, look.

01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:33.321
That's cool.

01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:35.801
Hey, what do you think
if we, like, painted

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.604
like, a giant mural of <i>Starry Night,</i>

01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:39.364
like, all over the walls?

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:42.330
I love it.
That's a great idea.

01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:43.720
Yeah.

01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:46.161
And then we could, like,
fill the ceiling

01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:49.927
with all those glow-in-the-dark stars,
you know?

01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:51.320
- Yeah.
- Like those stickers.

01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:55.963
Yeah, and maybe we could hang some up
here, you know, like a baby-mobile.

01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:58.407
Yeah.
And, you know what we could do?

01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:01.729
- We could make, like, constellations.
- Yeah.

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:04.008
And we could, like,
invent our own constellations.

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:06.208
Like, we can, like,
go back and forth with it.

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:09.609
And, like, imagine, like... imagine
the three of us, like, all together,

01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:11.569
publishing this, like, big book

01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:15.202
with, like, all of the, like, illustrations
of all the different constellations.

01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:17.840
What's wrong?

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:19.087
Nothing.

01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:21.971
Well, you don't seem that...
you don't seem that excited.

01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:23.485
No, I'm really excited.

01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:26.720
You know what I was thinking?

01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:32.370
I was thinking that we could put
the bookshelf right there.

01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:33.760
And then we could maybe have...

01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:35.643
- Whoa, wait! That's perfect!
- a rocking chair right here, right?

01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:37.131
- No, that's perfect.
- Isn't that perfect?

01:20:37.280 --> 01:20:38.441
Hang on, I'm gonna get it.

01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:55.285
- I love it.
- Oh, that reminds me.

01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:01.481
Look. Look-look-look-look-look.

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:06.568
Remember?

01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:08.324
- Yes.
- And.

01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:13.730
The Bible.

01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:23.562
- Marco. Marco.
- What?

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.649
Have you been taking your medication?

01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:31.850
Uh...

01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:35.366
No.

01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:39.481
No.

01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:43.130
I can't.

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:48.446
We decided that, you know,
we weren't gonna...

01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:50.728
- I know. We did.
- gonna do anything,

01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:52.922
you know, reckless
because I'm pregnant.

01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:55.367
That doesn't mean
we have to take the medication.

01:21:57.320 --> 01:21:59.209
I can get him to go back on the meds.

01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:00.771
No, you can't.

01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:02.410
Yes, I can.

01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:05.520
We have to.

01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:08.047
Carla, you can't.

01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:09.486
If he didn't get the message

01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:11.688
after he almost killed
the two of you in the river,

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:13.330
he's not going to get it.

01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:15.448
Then what are you suggesting?

01:22:15.600 --> 01:22:18.251
I don't see how you can stay with him.

01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:23.484
What are you saying?
That I shouldn't have this child if...

01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:26.325
I just want to be really clear.
Okay?

01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:31.008
You want to raise a child
with a psychotic manic parent.

01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:17.921
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:19.411
- I'm Carla.
- Hi. Kay Jamison.

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:21.240
- Nice to meet you.
- How do you do? Marco.

01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:23.440
- Nice to meet you.
- It's such an honor to meet you.

01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:24.971
Well, thank you.

01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:26.640
This is incredible.
I have to tell you,

01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:30.731
you know, your books
have just been so meaningful to us,

01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:34.851
and they've really helped us through a lot,
you know, both Carla and myself.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.001
Well, I'm glad.
Thank you.

01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:37.764
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:42.161
Yeah, so May 1 st, we're due,

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:45.847
and we know there's
certain sacrifices that go along

01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:49.010
with, you know... which...

01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:52.084
Yeah, which you mentioned in terms
of taking medication,

01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:53.765
whether or not to take medication

01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:55.962
or whether you
are going to take medication.

01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:58.885
My biggest concern
is just having a child,

01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:00.326
coming into this world,

01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:03.165
you know, welcoming this new life...

01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:07.680
and it sort of being

01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:12.604
around two people who are duller
than they are used to, or...

01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:14.683
When I first was medicated,
I was first medicated

01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:15.966
a very long time ago.

01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:18.122
Lithium had just come out
on the market.

01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:21.280
I was kept at a very high dose because
that's what people did at that time,

01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:24.006
and I did feel somewhat dead,
and I resisted it.

01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:25.964
But I'm still on lithium,

01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:28.083
and I don't feel in any way inhibited.

01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:30.083
I just don't know how I'm gonna make...

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:34.209
how my creativity is going to be affected.

01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:37.648
You're concerned about losing your art
and losing your passion.

01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:39.569
Medication's not going to take
your personality away.

01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:41.569
It's not going to take your own gift.

01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:43.444
It's a fire when it's out of control.

01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:47.770
And what medication can do
is to kind of tamp that down a bit

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:49.604
without losing that gift.

01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:54.641
It took quite a while
for my moods to kind of get in gear.

01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:57.565
I have felt infinitely happier.

01:24:57.720 --> 01:24:59.324
I'm more productive.

01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:03.769
I'm more able to count on myself
to produce and write.

01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:07.447
In every aspect of my life
it's been a godsend.

01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:09.887
I thought she was really impressive.
Was cool, right?

01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:11.525
She's weak.

01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:15.410
She didn't have the strength,
so she gave up.

01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:17.289
- What?
- You could see it in her.

01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:19.966
She was like...

01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:22.566
she wished that she could have

01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:24.330
what those artists have
that she writes about.

01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:25.720
But she doesn't have the guts.

01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:27.644
That's why she writes about them.

01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:33.488
You know, do you think
that Poe or Byron or Tchaikovsky,

01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:35.768
Melville, Hemingway,
would've backed down

01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:37.763
and turned away
from the storm the way she did?

01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:39.410
No. They rode the tides.

01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:41.085
They rode them, but she didn't.

01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:42.645
That's why she writes about them,

01:25:42.800 --> 01:25:46.009
because she wants to be like them
in her fantasy, but she can't.

01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:48.965
Well, I liked what she had to say
about, you know,

01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:51.367
how we can experience full emotion
even more than...

01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:53.648
I don't want the full emotion!

01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:55.760
- Well, then what do you want?
- I want the mania!

01:25:58.040 --> 01:25:59.485
You want the mania?

01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:10.960
- Well, it's fucking crazy.
- Why?

01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:12.610
Because of something
that your doctor told you

01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:14.364
- or something that your parents told you?
- No.

01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:17.404
Because you're not willing
to make any sacrifices.

01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:18.971
You say you want a family.

01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:20.451
You say you want love.

01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:22.560
But you're not willing to give
anything up for it.

01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:24.847
We're gonna elevate the baby with it.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.445
It's a gift, Carla.

01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:27.840
No, no, it's not a gift.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.365
- And you...
- Fuck!

01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:32.370
What is this?

01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:36.721
This, all this about the poetry,
about the beauty of it?

01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:38.251
Is this just bullshit?

01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:40.323
Let's just fucking cut it out, Carla.

01:26:40.480 --> 01:26:41.561
- Don't. Please, no.
- Fucking cancer.

01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:42.846
Yup. Tear it out.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.163
- Stop.
- Why do we wanna infect our baby with this?

01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:48.049
- Here. You take it, Carla!
- Don't!

01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:54.044
Carla, I'm sorry.

01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:02.369
Carla, I'm so sorry.

01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:19.446
Carla?

01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:23.566
Shit.

01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:26.250
Hello?

01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:35.603
I tried calling you all day.

01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:51.969
I didn't mean to push you like that.

01:27:56.520 --> 01:27:58.727
I never want to hurt you.

01:28:02.760 --> 01:28:04.285
I'm so sorry.

01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:08.611
Please.

01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:26.606
Have you been drinking?

01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:37.640
Marco.

01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:18.601
- Oh, hey.
- Surprise.

01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:20.489
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.

01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:23.966
What's going on?

01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:26.646
- Hey, come here. Surprise.
- What's going on?

01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:28.560
I wanted to throw us
a surprise baby shower.

01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:29.720
I called all of our parents,

01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:31.723
and I thought we could have
a surprise baby shower.

01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:33.450
Well, you actually said
it was an urgent meeting,

01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:35.011
- so that's why we rushed over.
- I know.

01:29:35.160 --> 01:29:36.924
I wanted it to be
a surprise for all of us.

01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:38.730
Oh, no, it's okay.
So good to see you.

01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:40.609
Hi, sweetheart.
You okay?

01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:41.840
Oh, yeah.
Everything's good.

01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:42.967
- All right.
- It's good.

01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:44.246
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:45.487
Good to see you.

01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:47.642
Hey, you know, before we...
Hey, wait, hold on, hold on.

01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:49.086
- Here you go. Here.
- No, thank you.

01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:50.366
- Before we... Marco.
- Here you go.

01:29:50.520 --> 01:29:52.440
- Marco, can I talk to you, please?
- Sure, sure.

01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:54.761
- Do you guys mind if we just...
- Oh, please, no, that's fine.

01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:56.445
No, I mean, now.
Can we talk?

01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:57.965
Could we talk now?

01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:00.561
Oh, yeah, just give me
one second, okay?

01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:02.404
Let me get this open.

01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:03.641
Just going to open this up.

01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:05.290
- Oh.
- Be careful with that.

01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:06.520
Huh?

01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:08.722
Aah.

01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:11.969
Whoa. Okay.

01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:16.050
- Sorry.
- It's okay. It's all right.

01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:17.281
- There you go.
- Just a little.

01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:19.283
- That's fine.
- Okay? Sure?

01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:20.646
- And a little bit.
- Marco.

01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:21.801
- What?
- Just... What's going on?

01:30:21.960 --> 01:30:22.961
- What?
- You all right?

01:30:23.120 --> 01:30:24.884
It's all good.

01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:27.406
Here.

01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:28.846
- You want some?
- You know what?

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.651
Oh, you know what?
You probably shouldn't because of the baby.

01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:34.804
I guess a little sip would be okay.
Right?

01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:37.645
I'll just pour you some,
and then when I finish making the toast...

01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:40.924
you can decide.

01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:45.610
Sorry. I forgot something.

01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:54.810
Here we go.
Got you a gift.

01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:56.803
- Thank you.
- Open it.

01:30:57.840 --> 01:30:59.126
Open it, open it, open it.

01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:20.487
Carla and I have been looking
for children's books...

01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:25.844
and I came across this one
a few days ago,

01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:28.441
and it just struck me as perfect,
you know?

01:31:28.600 --> 01:31:32.002
You know, when we were
in the hospital together,

01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:33.491
when we first met...

01:31:35.640 --> 01:31:38.405
we imagined that we were
from another planet

01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:40.881
because we don't belong here
on this earth.

01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:47.161
And we liked to pretend
that one day we'd get to go back...

01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:51.247
to our real planet, our home.

01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:55.964
And in this book...

01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:00.369
the little prince
is from another planet,

01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:01.806
but he's visiting Earth.

01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:07.166
And... eventually
he wants to go back home,

01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:10.244
but the only way that he can do that
is to die here on Earth.

01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:16.285
So, this is a toast...

01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:23.124
to a baby that will feel
like he belongs here, on Earth...

01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:27.165
on this planet.

01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:32.808
And won't have to die to go home.

01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:39.005
Carla, I just made a toast.

01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:42.922
- Carla.
- It's okay.

01:32:43.080 --> 01:32:44.889
It's a toast.
Raise the glass.

01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:46.127
I...

01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:48.248
Why don't you have a drink, Carla?

01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:55.971
Are you still gonna pretend, after all
of this, that you still can't drink?

01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:02.925
Because I know.

01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:06.688
- Why don't you just say it?
- All right.

01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:10.561
Just say it.
Just say it, say it.

01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:14.247
Carla had an abortion.
Surprise.

01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:21.370
Right?

01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:26.004
So, why don't you just say it, Carla?

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:28.567
- Please say it, please.
- All right, I did.

01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:32.647
Oh, God.

01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:34.404
How could you do that?

01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:36.881
Did you forget everything?

01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:41.365
No.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.650
I didn't forget anything.

01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:47.560
I thought you knew
that that was our miracle,

01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:49.329
that that was our gift from God.

01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:51.244
I thought you knew that!

01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:53.050
- I did. I did!
- I thought you knew that

01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:55.851
that was our gift from God!
So what changed?

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.001
- Because!
- What changed?

01:33:57.160 --> 01:33:58.207
- Because!
- Why?

01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:00.480
Because I didn't want it to be raised
by our illness!

01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:15.050
So we're a mistake?

01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:22.610
We're a mistake?

01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:26.090
We're a mistake?

01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:31.570
Are we a mistake, Carla?
Are we a mistake?

01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:50.566
So that's it.

01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:06.609
Hello?

01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:12.531
What?

01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:56.927
"As the sun and moon
aligned in the sky,"

01:36:57.120 --> 01:36:59.521
they illuminated each other's shine.

01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:03.651
<i>And the closer to each other they moved,
the brighter they shined,</i>

01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:07.247
<i>and the higher the fire
inside of us grew.</i>

01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:10.085
<i>As we raced through the days
on that fling,</i>

01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:11.480
<i>each footprint we laid</i>

01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:15.201
<i>blazed away that piece
of the earth's entire lifetime of beauty</i>

01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:17.647
<i>in the brief second it touched our feet,</i>

01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:20.485
<i>leaving nothing but ashes beneath us.</i>

01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:25.202
<i>"Until we had no ground left to stand on
and nowhere left to flee. "</i>

01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:28.449
<i>"And now that we've turned away
from our fire"</i>

01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:31.968
<i>to face the days that remained
unburned by the flames,</i>

01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:33.690
<i>and learn to gaze at them</i>

01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:36.491
<i>through sane eyes
one day at a time.</i>

01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:39.962
<i>We can look back at our book
with clear sight</i>

01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:43.562
<i>and give it the ending
that we never got the chance to write.</i>

01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:47.611
<i>And while I know it's too late
to pick up the ripped-up pages,</i>

01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:52.084
<i>I will admit,
I still think of our little prince.</i>

01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:55.881
<i>And sometimes I go outside
and look up at the sky</i>

01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:57.530
<i>and think about what planet</i>

01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:59.882
<i>he might've gone back to after he died.</i>

01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:03.841
<i>Then I imagine the three of us</i>

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:07.527
<i>living up there as a family
in another lifetime.</i>

01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:16.721
<i>But for now, you have your own life,
and I have mine.</i>

01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:19.611
<i>And we have to live them
the way we would have</i>

01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:23.128
<i>if we could go back to the day
we conceived our child</i>

01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:27.251
<i>and were able to see what
our manic eyes were blind to at the time.</i>

01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:33.249
<i>When the sun and moon finally came
as close as they could be</i>

01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:36.961
<i>and the fire inside us rose
to its highest peak,</i>

01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:40.010
<i>it leaped past
the fading ashes of our flesh</i>

01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:42.766
<i>to burn our love into eternity,</i>

01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:44.763
<i>through our baby.</i>

01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:46.490
<i>That eternal flame</i>

01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:49.769
<i>that could blaze brighter
than our manic one ever could</i>

01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:52.491
<i>on its brightest mania days,</i>

01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:54.847
<i>"but that would also sustain. "</i>

01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:27.640
- I'm really, really proud of you.
- Thanks.

01:39:27.800 --> 01:39:29.290
Maybe you'll stop by later?

01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:39.246
Hi.

01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:40.640
Hey.

01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:44.805
- I thought that went really well.
- Yeah.

01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:47.327
- Was a really good idea.
- Yeah.

01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:49.244
So how've you been?

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:54.083
Okay. How about you?

01:39:56.520 --> 01:39:58.443
Good.

01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:00.125
Yeah, really good.

01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:04.365
Is that him?

01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:08.520
Yeah.

01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:17.849
He looks like a solid guy.

01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:20.205
He is.

01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:26.369
Well, I should go.

01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:31.246
Hey, Marco.

01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:35.929
It's so good to see you.

01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:39.886
You, too.

01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:05.408
<i>There was a time long ago</i>

01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:07.801
<i>when tides would rise
and winds would blow</i>

01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:11.203
<i>when the stars pulsed spirals
of fire across the sky</i>

01:43:11.360 --> 01:43:14.045
<i>and all the lunatics saw,
and all the lunatics knew</i>

01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:16.646
<i>that the two eyes of God
had aligned in the sky</i>

01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:18.643
<i>to give us a glimpse
into the divine.</i>

01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:20.564
<i>And though the sane may deny</i>

01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:22.324
<i>we gazed through God's eyes</i>

01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:24.801
<i>and claim it was
just some misfiring synapses</i>

01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:26.769
<i>flashing through
a crack in our minds</i>

01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:28.160
<i>we all knew it was true</i>

01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:29.685
<i>we all knew we shared a view</i>

01:43:29.840 --> 01:43:31.729
<i>into something
just too beautiful to prove</i>

01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:33.962
<i>and they can't take that away
from me and you.</i>

01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:40.050
<i>Even when the seasons change,</i>

01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:41.929
<i>summer exceeds its stay,</i>

01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:43.764
<i>the sun creeps away</i>

01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:46.605
<i>and fall shadows
grab hold of your brain</i>

01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:48.364
<i>and you can feel your will</i>

01:43:48.520 --> 01:43:49.965
<i>within each withering leaf</i>

01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:52.527
<i>clinging to the trees
of the entire forest</i>

01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:55.160
<i>surrounding you slipping
as they fall down on you</i>

01:43:55.320 --> 01:43:57.163
<i>and then when Winter rolls around,</i>

01:43:57.320 --> 01:44:00.529
<i>your soul retreats
deep beneath the frozen ground</i>

01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:02.728
<i>and it's calling your body down</i>

01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:05.571
<i>and it feels like your ashes
are fighting gravity</i>

01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:08.240
<i>even then, Spring will come again</i>

01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:10.289
<i>and invite you to rise too high</i>

01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:12.124
<i>and it's up for you to decide</i>

01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:14.282
<i>if you'll repeat those seasonal tides</i>

01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:16.329
<i>that will lay waste to your lives.</i>

01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:18.284
<i>But if you choose to live</i>

01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:20.289
<i>you may look out at the sky</i>

01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:22.687
<i>and reminisce about those times</i>

01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:24.649
<i>when the Sun and the Moon
would align</i>

01:44:24.800 --> 01:44:26.689
<i>and each would find its other eye</i>

01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:29.969
<i>so that God could cry
about what was lost and why.</i>

01:44:30.120 --> 01:44:32.202
<i>But I tell you not to miss those times</i>

01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:34.169
<i>for the Sun still shines</i>

01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:35.924
<i>and the Moon will still rise</i>

01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:38.851
<i>and with just enough light
from the far off shine</i>

01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:40.451
<i>of the sun across the sky</i>

01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:44.400
<i>it will keep that divine sight
forever alive in your eyes</i>
