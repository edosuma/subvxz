00:01.635 --> 00:03.537
What is the point
of paying premiums

00:03.571 --> 00:05.706
if you fail to reimburse us
every month?

00:05.739 --> 00:07.041
No!
I've already held twice.

00:07.075 --> 00:08.076
You bloody hold!

00:08.109 --> 00:10.878
Let's see how that turns out,
shall we?

00:10.911 --> 00:12.813
Jimmy, did you remember
to pick up Dylan's running shoes

00:12.846 --> 00:14.548
and go to the pharmacy?
I did remember.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Great, thanks.

00:15.783 --> 00:17.618
I did not actually do it,
but you're welcome.

00:17.651 --> 00:19.087
I'll do it.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.088
Oh, no.

00:20.121 --> 00:21.789
Mom, I think
you got jury duty.

00:21.822 --> 00:23.424
That sucks, honey.

00:23.457 --> 00:26.160
Trapped in that room for hours
with nothing to do.

00:28.129 --> 00:29.763
Maya

would be *

00:43.477 --> 00:45.779
* 'Cause I've got
a golden ticket *

to do jack squat *

00:53.254 --> 00:55.055
* Can't pick up groceries,
mop the floor *

00:55.089 --> 00:56.857

Too bad.

I'd get caught up *

* Please, a female assist
Hold it.

a golden ticket *

01:22.883 --> 01:26.754

to fulfill *

01:26.787 --> 01:27.988
You said "doody."

01:28.021 --> 01:29.390
You're not here!

01:29.423 --> 01:31.292
**

01:31.325 --> 01:32.993
Good morning.
Jurors: * Good morning

01:33.026 --> 01:34.695
Group number two.
* Group number two

01:34.728 --> 01:38.065
**

01:38.098 --> 01:40.067
* Good morning
* Good morning!
Whoa.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.203
* I hope I get you

01:42.236 --> 01:45.072
* God, what did you do

01:45.105 --> 01:46.907
* I never thought
I'd see a day *

01:46.940 --> 01:48.776
* A hit-and-run case
would make me laugh *

01:48.809 --> 01:50.578
* I'm getting paid
15 bucks a day *

01:50.611 --> 01:52.413
And lunch is

01:52.446 --> 01:54.615
* But I've got a golden ticket

01:54.648 --> 01:56.350
* She's got a golden ticket

* I've got a guilt-free reason

for the nearby court *

02:07.928 --> 02:09.430
Yeah! Whoo!
Yeah! Whoo!

02:09.463 --> 02:12.065
Maya. Maya?

02:14.435 --> 02:16.136
I guess I got to do it.

**

02:21.375 --> 02:23.644
Guys, I have
an announcement.

02:23.677 --> 02:25.446
I've realized that,
for a long time,

02:25.479 --> 02:27.047
I've been so focused
on Taylor,

02:27.080 --> 02:29.517
I've neglected the very thing
that matters the most to me.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.519
Over-application
of Axe body spray?

02:31.552 --> 02:33.020
"Farting in your sleep"?

02:33.053 --> 02:34.455
Making pronouncements
about yourself

02:34.488 --> 02:35.623
that open you up to ridicule?

02:35.656 --> 02:36.957
Family!
Oh, family.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.326
So, I decided

02:38.359 --> 02:40.728
to focus my attention
on you lovely people.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.363
Have you given up on Taylor?

02:42.396 --> 02:43.731
Yeah, I saw
a glimmer of hope,

02:43.764 --> 02:46.400
but I think she's finally
realized she's out of my league.

02:46.434 --> 02:47.901
Mom, be honest with me.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.370
Taylor's out of my league,
isn't she?

02:49.403 --> 02:50.438
Oh, no!

02:50.471 --> 02:52.139
Of all the days
for me to have jury duty.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.441
Let me see
if I can postpone it.

02:53.474 --> 02:54.575
Oh, no. I can't.

02:56.777 --> 02:57.678
So, what do you say, Dad?

02:57.711 --> 02:59.079
Want to take your son

02:59.112 --> 03:01.048
on one of those driving lessons
we've been talking about?

03:01.081 --> 03:02.750
Ohh, Dylan and I
have plans.

03:02.783 --> 03:04.752
We're picking up some stuff
for JJ's man cave.

03:04.785 --> 03:05.786
Maybe when I get back?

03:05.819 --> 03:07.421
I can come with.
Dylan won't mind.

03:07.455 --> 03:08.456
Wow.

03:08.489 --> 03:09.990
You have been gone
a long time.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.759
Kenneth cellphone:
* Chillin' now

03:11.792 --> 03:12.760
* Oh, come on, come on

03:12.793 --> 03:13.861
* Ahh

03:13.894 --> 03:15.896
* Ahh --

03:15.929 --> 03:18.131
It's -- It's my mom.

03:19.267 --> 03:21.802
"That's his --" D-A --
"dating app.

03:21.835 --> 03:23.404
Someone matched with him."

03:23.437 --> 03:25.706
Ooh!
Let's see this lucky lady.

03:25.739 --> 03:28.108
Run!
Give me that!

03:28.141 --> 03:30.278
Save yourself!

03:30.311 --> 03:31.379
All right, let's see.

03:31.412 --> 03:32.480
Uh...

03:32.513 --> 03:33.581
Huh!

03:33.614 --> 03:35.816
Four pictures
of you in a van.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.318
You're living in that thing.

03:37.351 --> 03:38.319
Next.

03:38.352 --> 03:41.221
"I thought she was pretty."

03:41.255 --> 03:43.491
If you like her,
get your own profile.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.460
"Should I?"

03:46.494 --> 03:47.695
That's a big step.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.096
I-I'd have to talk it over
with your mother.

03:49.129 --> 03:53.634
"I wasn't asking permission.
I'm 18."

03:53.667 --> 03:55.035
Huh!

03:55.068 --> 03:58.339
That is so much easier.
Best of luck.

03:58.372 --> 03:59.507
Let me know
when you take a wife.

03:59.540 --> 04:03.811
Vacation beverage?
check.

04:03.844 --> 04:06.747
New book that's actually
six years old.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.749
"Soon to be
a major motion picture."

04:08.782 --> 04:10.250
Gosh, I wonder
how that turned out.

04:10.284 --> 04:12.052
Please look
at your juror badge.

04:12.085 --> 04:15.323
If your number starts
with 1, 5, or 9,

04:15.356 --> 04:17.358
you are excused.
You can go home now.

04:17.391 --> 04:19.360
If I didn't call your number,

04:19.393 --> 04:21.495
you must stay here
through the end of the day.

04:21.529 --> 04:24.164
Yes!
Melanie: Yes!

04:26.066 --> 04:27.868
Melanie Hertzal.

04:27.901 --> 04:29.437
Objection!

04:29.470 --> 04:32.239
This woman is my enemy.
Please have her removed.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.341
Sustained?

04:33.374 --> 04:34.808
You can't do that.
You're not a judge.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.276
She's so rude.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.111
If you want to throw the book
at her, I have "Gone Girl."

04:40.180 --> 04:42.082
Oh, Dad.
You're back.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.684
I thought we were gonna
go on a ride.

04:43.717 --> 04:44.785
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

04:44.818 --> 04:46.286
Let us just finish
this point.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.188
When did you get so good
at Ping

04:48.221 --> 04:49.490
I guess when you were
off with Taylor.

04:49.523 --> 04:50.524
You have time
for stuff like this

04:50.558 --> 04:51.759
when you're not
in a relationship.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.661
You're married to Mom.
I remembered that.

04:53.694 --> 04:57.097
Okay, Dad, just get me
whenever this point ends.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.166
But, Daddy, we're
in the middle of a game.

04:59.199 --> 05:00.300
She said "Daddy," Ray.

05:00.334 --> 05:03.303
What about me?
Come on, don't be like that.

05:03.337 --> 05:04.805
This isn't gonna
take that long.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.474
Yeah.
We're not very good.

05:06.507 --> 05:12.880
**

05:12.913 --> 05:14.782
Ray, stop.
Come back.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.217
"Film director,
chocolate lover,

05:17.250 --> 05:20.988
rocks a wheelchair,
nonverbal badass."

05:21.021 --> 05:22.856
Yeah, man. That's you!

05:22.890 --> 05:24.892
Nice pictures,

05:24.925 --> 05:26.994
except let's get one
without the shirt.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.396
Good.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.364
That was a test,
and you passed.

05:30.398 --> 05:32.700
Never strip
for an online picture.

05:32.733 --> 05:34.402
I know I never have.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.837
My mama raised me right.
No dummy.

05:36.870 --> 05:39.540
Don't search for it.
It's -- It's not there.

05:41.174 --> 05:44.244
Okay, so,
are we posting this?

05:44.277 --> 05:47.047
**

05:48.115 --> 05:49.316
All right.

05:49.349 --> 05:51.385
Hello, ladies! We're live.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.422
Yeah.

05:55.923 --> 05:59.259
**

05:59.292 --> 06:01.795
I forgot to tell you,
this part sucks.

06:04.131 --> 06:06.434
Do any of you, for any reason,
feel unable

06:06.467 --> 06:08.769
to be an impartial juror
in this case?

06:08.802 --> 06:12.540
Your Honor, I'm afraid I have to
answer yes...for her.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.542
She lied her way into a slot

06:14.575 --> 06:16.644
at a school that would've been
perfect for my son.

06:16.677 --> 06:18.646
Her daughter also broke
my other son's heart.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.047
Those are false accusations.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.616
Please dismiss the stupid juror
with the ugly earrings.

06:22.650 --> 06:25.285
What does any of this have to do
with my vandalism trial?

06:25.318 --> 06:27.254
Your Honor, I believe
your hallowed courtroom

06:27.287 --> 06:29.389
is no place for
a garbage human like her.

06:29.423 --> 06:30.558
Get rid of her and keep me.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.860
I will give you
such a good verdict.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.162
Keep me, and my verdict
will blow your mind.

06:35.195 --> 06:37.465
Are you even a U.S. citizen?
I think so!

06:37.498 --> 06:39.600
Let's not openly campaign
against other jurors.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.268
You're not
the only slacking-off
special-needs mom here.

06:41.301 --> 06:42.503
You will not ruin this!

06:42.536 --> 06:43.671
You're ruining this for me!

06:43.704 --> 06:45.506
I came here to get away
from my home drama.

06:45.539 --> 06:46.974
You are my home drama!

06:47.007 --> 06:48.909
Go away and let me read
"Gone Girl" in peace.

06:48.942 --> 06:50.511
Oh, she isn't dead,
and they end up together.

06:51.679 --> 06:53.380
You are Satan's hemorrhoid!

06:53.413 --> 06:54.515
Dismiss her!
Dismiss her!

06:54.548 --> 06:55.983
You're both staying!

06:56.016 --> 06:58.452
Five bucks says
they're special-needs moms.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.093
Dad stealer!
What?

07:06.126 --> 07:07.695
He and I
had a good thing going,

07:07.728 --> 07:10.297
but I took my eye off the ball,
and you swooped in.

07:10.330 --> 07:12.099
Whatever you say,
Tiny Sweatshirt.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.401
I wore this for school photos
a couple years ago,

07:14.434 --> 07:18.639
and Dad said it looked -- this
is a direct quote -- "nice."

07:18.672 --> 07:20.040
Well, now it looks --

07:20.073 --> 07:22.442
and this is a direct quote --
"desperate."

07:22.476 --> 07:23.977
This isn't over.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.245
Oh, yes.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.114
There's stuff I can do with Dad
that you can't --

07:27.147 --> 07:29.249
guy stuff.
That's right.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.251
I'm not afraid to use
my masculine wiles.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.620
Oh, hey, Dylan.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.254
That's a nice color on you.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.990
Ray, you left something
in here.

07:37.024 --> 07:38.559
Bye-bye!

07:40.160 --> 07:41.829
Judge: I rule that
the defendant's confession

07:41.862 --> 07:43.697
is, in fact, admissible.

07:43.731 --> 07:45.799
We'll take a brief recess.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.969
A confession
and these pictures?

07:49.002 --> 07:50.504
This'll be done soon.

07:50.538 --> 07:51.705
Damn it!

07:51.739 --> 07:53.774
My vacation is ending
before it even began.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.076
What if it
doesn't have to?

07:56.109 --> 08:00.480
What if a certain juror or two
can't decide?

08:00.514 --> 08:02.149
Are you suggesting
a truce?

08:02.182 --> 08:03.784
I'm not suggesting
we become friends,

08:03.817 --> 08:05.853
but if we keep our family issues
out of this,

08:05.886 --> 08:07.521
we can focus on
the task at hand --

08:07.555 --> 08:09.489
keeping this case going
as long as possible.

08:09.523 --> 08:12.159
I'm not giving up
my golden ticket.

08:12.192 --> 08:14.294
Did you sing
that song, too?

08:14.327 --> 08:15.529
Yep.

08:15.563 --> 08:17.765
Okay, buddy.
We got some bites.

08:17.798 --> 08:18.999
I'll be over there.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.868
Now, if it's going well,
I'll hang back.

08:20.901 --> 08:23.537
If you need a rescue,
knock over your drink,

08:23.571 --> 08:25.673
and I'll come swooping in.
I'm sorry,

08:25.706 --> 08:27.641
did you just tell him
to knock over his drink?

08:29.109 --> 08:30.578
No.

08:31.812 --> 08:32.980
Yeah.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.048
I loved your profile.

08:35.082 --> 08:38.552
You actually look
a lot like my ex-boyfriend.

08:38.586 --> 08:40.120
See?

08:40.153 --> 08:41.922
And my one before that.

08:41.955 --> 08:44.057
And the one before that.

08:44.091 --> 08:46.259
Oh!

08:46.293 --> 08:48.128
This could not have come
at a better time.

08:48.161 --> 08:49.730
I'm applying to colleges
right now,

08:49.763 --> 08:52.532
and they are going to love
that my boyfriend's disabled.

08:54.768 --> 08:58.005
I saw your profile, and
I knew that I could heal you.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.607
Hold these crystals.

08:59.640 --> 09:02.442
Just don't hold them together.
They're really powerful.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.246
Could you do that before?

09:08.048 --> 09:10.918
10 guilty, 2 not guilty.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.119
I'm sorry.

09:12.152 --> 09:13.453
How does anyone think
that he didn't do it?

09:13.486 --> 09:14.922
The man deserves
his day in court.

09:14.955 --> 09:15.923
That's what we just did.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.625
I don't think he did it.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.359
He seems like
a really nice guy to me.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.728
He confessed.

09:20.761 --> 09:21.962
And you're just going to
take the word of a vandal?

09:21.995 --> 09:24.064
So, you do think he did it.
Let's vote again.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.799
Guilty?

09:25.833 --> 09:27.635
It's pretty clear
we're gonna be here awhile.

09:27.668 --> 09:30.871
Yeah, justice will be served,
and I, for one,

09:30.904 --> 09:33.273
am willing to stay here
as long as it takes.

09:33.306 --> 09:35.142
Lunch. 90 minutes.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.376
Ooh!

09:36.409 --> 09:38.545
Is the new "Fifty Shades" movie
90 minutes long?

09:38.578 --> 09:40.347
Well, the first 90 minutes
of it is.

09:41.982 --> 09:43.183
Oh.

09:43.216 --> 09:45.052
Oh, welcome, Dad.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.554
Everything okay?
I don't know.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.389
"Dad, meet me in the bathroom

09:49.422 --> 09:52.292
for some long-overdue
man-on-man time.

09:52.325 --> 09:54.161
Loose-fitting attire
recommended,"

09:54.194 --> 09:56.163
is not the sort of text
I get every day.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.131
Which is exactly the problem.

09:58.165 --> 10:00.634
When was the last time we had
a good, old

10:00.668 --> 10:02.402
Maybe we should invite Dylan.

10:02.435 --> 10:03.771
Oh, wait.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.739
We can't because
it's a man bath.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.810
Don't you take your shirt off
for a steam?

10:09.843 --> 10:10.911
Oh, no.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.412
I'm not comfortable
with my own nudity,

10:12.445 --> 10:14.381
but I am very comfortable
with yours.

10:14.414 --> 10:16.316
That's what
this is all about.

10:16.349 --> 10:18.819
Oh, God, this is nice, huh?

10:21.354 --> 10:23.991
Aah, aah, aah!

10:24.024 --> 10:25.325
Buddy!
Aah, aah!

10:26.960 --> 10:30.497
Okay, this is
maybe 70 degrees, tops.

10:31.665 --> 10:33.300
Dude, don't be bummed.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.803
You got all of your bad dates
out of the way in one day.

10:36.970 --> 10:42.409
"I wanted the girls
to be okay with the chair,

10:42.442 --> 10:44.945
but they were there
because of it.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.948
They seemed nice --"
O-N -- "online."

10:47.981 --> 10:49.683
Yeah, it happens.

10:49.717 --> 10:51.184
Some people
don't represent themselves

10:51.218 --> 10:53.320
the way they really are.
Is this you?

10:53.353 --> 10:56.023
Yes, that's me!
I took that picture last year.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.190
Like, took it

10:57.224 --> 10:58.826
out of a box of
really old pictures?

10:58.859 --> 11:01.261
Do you mind?

11:01.294 --> 11:04.898
People will see there's
more to you than this chair.

11:04.932 --> 11:06.366
So, does this say "single"

11:06.399 --> 11:08.969
because "divorced twice"
wasn't an option?

11:09.002 --> 11:10.570
I love to love, Dylan!

11:10.603 --> 11:11.772
No regrets!

11:13.907 --> 11:16.243
Oh, there's my juror.
How's it going?

11:16.276 --> 11:20.147
Jimmy, have you ever held
someone's life in your hands?

11:20.180 --> 11:21.648
It's sobering.

11:21.681 --> 11:22.850
You smell like popcorn.

11:22.883 --> 11:26.053
I cannot discuss the trial,
not even the smell.

11:26.086 --> 11:28.588
But guess who's on my jury?
Melanie Hertzal.

11:28.621 --> 11:30.557
Taylor's mom?
Oh, that's great.

11:30.590 --> 11:31.691
Maybe you could ask her

11:31.725 --> 11:33.460
to put in a good word for Ray
with Taylor.

11:33.493 --> 11:36.263
He's acting really odd,
and I think it's about Taylor.

11:36.296 --> 11:37.765
I hope it's about Taylor.

11:37.798 --> 11:41.401
If not, we're in for a really
weird, steamy few years.

11:41.434 --> 11:43.303
Yeah, but it's really not
why I'm there.

11:43.336 --> 11:47.607
So, you won't use your time
with Melanie to help him?

11:47.640 --> 11:49.109
That's --
That's not like you.

11:49.142 --> 11:52.012
I'm not me!
I'm juror number eight!

11:52.045 --> 11:53.580
I don't have to think
about Ray.

11:53.613 --> 11:54.982
I don't have to think
about any of you!

11:55.015 --> 11:56.984
It's my time.
Uh, sorry.

11:57.017 --> 11:58.385
Do you like jury duty?

11:58.418 --> 11:59.686
I love it!

11:59.719 --> 12:01.021
I've tasted what it's like
to be one of those people

12:01.054 --> 12:02.489
that stares at their phone
all day.

12:02.522 --> 12:05.492
It's numb and it's foggy,
and I'm not going back.

12:05.525 --> 12:07.795
**

12:11.932 --> 12:18.405
**

12:20.240 --> 12:24.511
**

12:24.544 --> 12:26.213
The timeline doesn't work.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.015
He's seen at the bar,

12:28.048 --> 12:31.919
then, somehow, he's
magically breaking a window

12:31.952 --> 12:35.022
across the street
an hour later.

12:35.055 --> 12:37.457
I mean...

12:37.490 --> 12:38.625
Let's take a short break.

12:38.658 --> 12:39.993
Or a long one.

12:40.027 --> 12:41.028
Yeah,
don't label the break.

12:41.061 --> 12:42.262
Let the break be
what it wants to be.

12:42.295 --> 12:43.530
Should we go out
for our break?

12:43.563 --> 12:45.032
Oh, we've been going out
so much.

12:45.065 --> 12:46.533
Let's just stay in
and be cozy.

12:46.566 --> 12:47.434
I brought Scrabble!

12:47.467 --> 12:49.336
Okay. I love us.
Me too.

12:49.369 --> 12:51.972
I'm so glad we're over
all that Taylor/Ray nonsense.

12:52.005 --> 12:54.441
Yeah, um...

12:54.474 --> 12:57.477
do you know, about that,
would you be open

12:57.510 --> 13:01.381
to putting in the tiniest
good word with Taylor for Ray?

13:01.414 --> 13:02.816
'Cause he's so sweet,
and he's really hurting.

13:02.850 --> 13:04.985
Don't.

13:05.018 --> 13:07.154
Please, can we keep this going
just a few more days?

13:07.187 --> 13:09.089
My son has a piano recital
on Thursday.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.590
He's so bad.

13:10.623 --> 13:13.293
Do you not think Ray's
good enough for Taylor?

13:13.326 --> 13:14.862
Don't make me say it.

13:14.895 --> 13:18.798
Taylor's kind of, you know,
out of his league.

13:18.832 --> 13:21.468
Objection!
Sustained! Overruled!

13:21.501 --> 13:23.103
Oh! Truce over!

13:23.136 --> 13:24.271
Maya!

13:24.304 --> 13:25.705
I could've spelled "zebra"!

13:31.411 --> 13:33.180
Talking to a girl?

13:34.915 --> 13:38.485
"Her name is --"
L-A-U -- "Lauren.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.720
We have a --" D --
"a date tomorrow!"

13:40.753 --> 13:42.022
Nice!

13:42.055 --> 13:43.056
Let's see.

13:43.090 --> 13:45.025
Oh!
She's got bangs.

13:45.058 --> 13:46.426
That means she's smart.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.628
Okay.

13:48.661 --> 13:49.696
Wait.

13:49.729 --> 13:51.531
Did you put up new pictures?

13:51.564 --> 13:53.700
Where's your chair?

13:53.733 --> 13:56.203
"I took that stuff out.

13:56.236 --> 13:58.371
They only saw
my disabilities."

13:58.405 --> 14:00.807
Okay, but you can't lie.

14:00.840 --> 14:05.545
"You use
a 30-year-old picture."

14:05.578 --> 14:08.548
It's four years old!

14:08.581 --> 14:12.886
It -- Me using an old picture
isn't as big as, um...

14:15.088 --> 14:19.026
"You said
there's more to me."

14:19.059 --> 14:23.897
Yes, but it may take
someone special to see it.

14:23.931 --> 14:27.968
"'Special' like an act of --"
C"

14:28.001 --> 14:30.170
That's not what I meant.

14:31.271 --> 14:32.605
My boba!

14:32.639 --> 14:34.474
The balls are everywhere.

14:34.507 --> 14:36.476
You think Taylor
is too good for Ray.

14:36.509 --> 14:37.911
I will prove you wrong.

14:37.945 --> 14:40.080
And when I do, you're gonna
put in a good word for him.

14:40.113 --> 14:41.114
How are you gonna prove it?

14:41.148 --> 14:43.116
With a jury of our peers.

14:43.150 --> 14:45.618
You.
You settle an easy debate?

14:45.652 --> 14:49.990
Do you think that that girl
is a suitable match for...

14:50.023 --> 14:52.625
Ugh. Bad picture.

14:52.659 --> 14:53.927
Weird smile.

14:53.961 --> 14:55.428
Oh, man bun.
Come on, Ray!

14:55.462 --> 14:57.197
Yeah. That boy.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.966
This feels off-task.
It is.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.200
But if you settle this,

15:00.233 --> 15:03.303
we will vote that that guy
is guilty or not guilty

15:03.336 --> 15:05.205
or whichever one
he obviously is,

15:05.238 --> 15:06.373
and then we can all go home.

15:06.406 --> 15:07.807
Deal?
Works for me.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.876
Oh.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.511
Was just out with
our neighbor Donny,

15:11.544 --> 15:13.413
having a catch.
Hey.

15:13.446 --> 15:16.083
Uh, Ray, the glove goes
on your nondominant hand.

15:16.116 --> 15:18.618
Joke's on you.
Both my hands are nondominant.

15:18.651 --> 15:22.089
Now Donny is gonna take me
to practice driving.

15:22.122 --> 15:23.991
Wait.
I barely know you,

15:24.024 --> 15:25.192
and you're teaching my son
to drive?

15:25.225 --> 15:27.694
You're the best, Donny.
Owe you one.

15:27.727 --> 15:29.997
That's a good-looking
sweatshirt.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.298
No.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.000
No!

15:33.033 --> 15:35.668
**

15:35.702 --> 15:37.337
JJ?

15:38.571 --> 15:40.107
Uh, hi.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.644
Uh, it's from you.

15:44.677 --> 15:47.414
Why are you being so...

15:47.447 --> 15:51.118
"Lauren, as you have
probably noticed by now,

15:51.151 --> 15:52.986
I use a wheelchair.

15:53.020 --> 15:55.022
I'm also nonverbal,

15:55.055 --> 15:57.357
which is why I've just been
nodding a lot,

15:57.390 --> 15:59.059
but everything else I said
was true.

15:59.092 --> 16:01.694
I'm the same person
you connected with online.

16:01.728 --> 16:05.198
Give me a chance, and
I promise you'll see that."

16:05.232 --> 16:08.068
**

16:08.101 --> 16:10.270
I don't think this is
going to work out.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.771
What?!

16:11.804 --> 16:13.073
Hey, JJ.

16:13.106 --> 16:15.175
Big mistake, Lauren.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.243
Huge.

16:16.276 --> 16:17.344
How do you know my name?

16:17.377 --> 16:18.645
Doesn't matter.

16:18.678 --> 16:21.148
What matters is,
this guy is smart.

16:21.181 --> 16:22.982
This is guy is funny.

16:23.016 --> 16:26.053
Sure, he's a bit too sarcastic,
and he'll eat all your candy,

16:26.086 --> 16:28.155
and he'll think you don't know,
but you know.

16:28.188 --> 16:31.958
I just feel bad that you can't
see past his disability.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.726
It's not about that.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.096
He lied.

16:36.129 --> 16:37.730
I'm looking
for something real,

16:37.764 --> 16:39.866
and that can't start
with dishonesty.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.305
Pbht!
Can you believe her?

16:45.338 --> 16:47.240
Know-it-all.

16:47.274 --> 16:49.742
"She was --"
R-I -- "right."

16:49.776 --> 16:51.311
Yeah, I didn't wanna
say anything,

16:51.344 --> 16:54.547
but, damn,
Lauren's a genius.

16:54.581 --> 16:57.384
"You said the same thing.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.686
You're pretty smart, too."

16:59.719 --> 17:01.921
Yeah, imagine if
I had bangs.

17:03.022 --> 17:07.594
And so, ad hominem,
in Costco est,

17:07.627 --> 17:10.697
excellent Christmas presents,
handwritten love letters,

17:10.730 --> 17:12.932
zero sexual pressure.

17:12.965 --> 17:15.102
Please, all those massages?
Over the shirts.

17:15.135 --> 17:17.604
I think he's cute,
and he's really smart.

17:17.637 --> 17:18.905
I liked him
from the beginning.

17:18.938 --> 17:20.773
I think he might be
out of her league.

17:20.807 --> 17:22.342
Yeah, let's not get crazy.

17:22.375 --> 17:25.545
Okay.
He's in her league?

17:25.578 --> 17:27.080
Show of hands?

17:30.450 --> 17:32.319
Fine!
Okay, I liked him, too.

17:32.352 --> 17:34.254
He is cute and funny,

17:34.287 --> 17:36.256
and he gave me a couple
of those sexless massages.

17:36.289 --> 17:38.458
And they were wonderful.

17:38.491 --> 17:39.626
Yeah, they are wonderful,
aren't they?

17:39.659 --> 17:42.795
You win, Maya.
He's in her league.

17:42.829 --> 17:43.796
Yes!

17:43.830 --> 17:45.632
Yeah. High five.

17:45.665 --> 17:47.634
No five.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.836
And I will put in a word
with Taylor.

17:49.869 --> 17:51.304
And she'll listen, too.

17:51.338 --> 17:53.806
God,
those kids depend on me.

17:53.840 --> 17:56.075
I know.
Mine depend on me, too.

17:56.109 --> 17:58.311
That's why our time here
is so precious.

17:58.345 --> 18:01.080
And you gave up your whole break
for Ray.

18:01.114 --> 18:04.184
Well, we don't get to
take a break.

18:04.217 --> 18:06.052
Do we?

18:06.085 --> 18:08.255
It's been a pleasure,
juror number three.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.790
Likewise, number eight.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.765
Oh! Forgot.
Not guilty.

18:18.798 --> 18:19.866
Yeah, whatever she said.

18:19.899 --> 18:20.967
You mean "guilty"!

18:21.000 --> 18:22.869
Yeah, yeah, that.
See you next year!

18:22.902 --> 18:24.070
Tighten that up
a little bit.

18:24.103 --> 18:24.971
There we go.

18:25.004 --> 18:26.673
Ray: Oh, come on.

18:26.706 --> 18:27.874
First, Ping-Pong
is your thing.

18:27.907 --> 18:29.376
Now fixing cars
is your thing?

18:29.409 --> 18:30.710
Buddy, it's not
what it looks like.

18:30.743 --> 18:32.412
No.
No, I deserve this.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.614
Dylan, don't make the same
mistake I did.

18:34.647 --> 18:37.417
Cherish this man.
Keep him close.

18:37.450 --> 18:40.720
Because his love
is like the sun,

18:40.753 --> 18:42.422
and when
the sun goes away --

18:44.457 --> 18:47.927
When the sun goes away,
only the sad flowers grow.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.397
Shut up, Ray.
The car is for you.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.432
We've been fixing it up
this whole time.

18:52.465 --> 18:55.134
We wanted it to be a surprise,
you blubbering dumb-dumb.

18:55.168 --> 18:58.037
You don't love Dylan
more than me?

18:58.070 --> 19:01.208
Of course not.
I love you both equally.

19:01.241 --> 19:03.810
Now, did you hear the part
about where you get a car?

19:03.843 --> 19:05.178
How exciting is that?

19:05.212 --> 19:06.646
S-So you love us
the exact same?

19:06.679 --> 19:08.381
You're getting a damn car,
Ray!

19:14.354 --> 19:17.056
This the family
I always wanted you to be.

19:17.089 --> 19:19.659
A car.

19:19.692 --> 19:21.194
My car.

19:21.228 --> 19:24.531
And your thing was actually
something wonderful for me.

19:26.065 --> 19:27.166
So, just to be clear,

19:27.200 --> 19:28.735
like a "Sophie's Choice"
situation,

19:28.768 --> 19:30.169
she would have no edge
on me whatsoever?

19:34.073 --> 19:35.908
No!

19:37.744 --> 19:40.580
So, you really don't have
a favorite?

19:40.613 --> 19:41.714
No.

19:41.748 --> 19:42.882
Ray:
Where'd you throw them?

19:42.915 --> 19:45.752
Ha!
But you don't make it easy.

19:45.785 --> 19:49.222
"People say I'm
the strong, silent type

19:49.256 --> 19:53.860
because I have cerebral palsy
and I'm nonverbal."

19:53.893 --> 19:55.862
Better!

19:55.895 --> 19:58.598
I still think you
might want a picture

19:58.631 --> 20:00.667
where you show
a little more skin.

20:00.700 --> 20:04.203
"What is your deal, man?"

20:06.105 --> 20:08.775
Okay, here's
my updated profile.

20:08.808 --> 20:15.382
"Two failed marriages
have made me an expert.

20:15.415 --> 20:21.754
Here's hoping
third time's the charm.

20:21.788 --> 20:25.292
No Argentineans."

20:25.325 --> 20:26.793
I had an experience.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.663
Anyway, uh, ready to show people
who we really are?

20:32.465 --> 20:33.733
Post it.

20:35.335 --> 20:36.603
And...

20:36.636 --> 20:38.204
...posted.

20:49.749 --> 20:50.817
"In the matter of Ray
out of Taylor's league

20:50.850 --> 20:52.819
versus Ray
in Taylor's league,

20:52.852 --> 20:55.722
we, the jury, find Ray
to be in Taylor's league."

20:55.755 --> 20:57.357
What did you do?
Oh, nothing bad.

20:57.390 --> 20:58.791
I just shared
your breakup story

20:58.825 --> 21:00.493
with a roomful of strangers.
What?

21:00.527 --> 21:02.495
Weren't you at jury duty?
Yes.

21:02.529 --> 21:05.298
And like all things,
I twisted it to fit my needs.

21:05.332 --> 21:08.067
Congratulations, darling.
You are good enough for Taylor!

21:08.100 --> 21:09.802
Oh, whose mother
was there, actually,

21:09.836 --> 21:11.538
and she's gonna
put in a good word for you

21:11.571 --> 21:12.939
with her daughter.

21:12.972 --> 21:15.074
Mom, that's --
that's amazing.

21:15.107 --> 21:17.043
Thank you!
Ray?

21:17.076 --> 21:19.078
Do we thank Mummy
with our words?

21:19.111 --> 21:21.781
**

21:23.483 --> 21:24.951
Mmm.

21:24.984 --> 21:26.919
Oh, there's
no place like home.
