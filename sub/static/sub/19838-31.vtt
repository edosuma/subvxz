00:30.590 --> 00:32.010
<b>Dispose of them.</b>

00:32.250 --> 00:34.920
<b>I'm busy right now.</b>

00:34.920 --> 00:37.910
<b>Don't bother me with reports 
I don't need to hear!</b>

<b>Date x With x Palm</b>

02:20.430 --> 02:23.910
<b>I don't know which nation sent you.</b>

02:24.360 --> 02:26.610
<b>But having entered this palace,</b>

02:27.240 --> 02:29.460
<b>you must now die painful deaths.</b>

02:30.970 --> 02:32.010
<b>Your Majesty...</b>

02:34.130 --> 02:37.790
<b>I needn't even strain my eyes to sense it.</b>

02:39.740 --> 02:41.110
<b>This is a rare human.</b>

02:44.490 --> 02:46.930
<b>An appetizing treat.</b>

03:01.200 --> 03:02.460
<b>This is it...</b>

03:02.460 --> 03:03.840
<b>This is the flavor I sought!</b>

03:07.270 --> 03:08.160
<b>I feel it.</b>

03:08.880 --> 03:10.600
<b>I feel it! I feel it!</b>

03:12.040 --> 03:12.960
<b>This is it!</b>

03:17.490 --> 03:19.720
<b>I can feel power surging through my body!</b>

03:20.420 --> 03:22.040
<b>Nyow <i>I understand...</i></b>

03:22.810 --> 03:24.950
<b><i>This is the King's power.</i></b>

03:25.910 --> 03:29.730
<b><i>He can take aura from rare humans he consumes.</i></b>

03:30.560 --> 03:31.610
<b><i>In other words,</i></b>

03:32.580 --> 03:34.820
<b><i>the more he eats, the stronger he will grow.</i></b>

03:48.550 --> 03:50.680
<b>Hmm? Who are you people?</b>

03:50.680 --> 03:51.740
<b>Guards!</b>

03:52.360 --> 03:54.630
<b>What are you incompetents doing?</b>

03:55.270 --> 03:56.480
<b><i>Worthless.</i></b>

03:57.020 --> 03:59.000
<b><i>I can't sense anything.</i></b>

03:59.250 --> 04:01.010
<b>Insolent thugs!</b>

04:01.010 --> 04:03.130
<b>Do you know who I am?</b>

04:03.130 --> 04:04.930
<b>A supreme leader of this era,</b>

04:04.930 --> 04:06.890
<b>a king among kings...</b>

04:06.890 --> 04:09.400
<b>I am Masador Diego!</b>

04:10.640 --> 04:13.930
<b>Why does that scum claim to be the king?</b>

04:14.820 --> 04:18.400
<b>In the human world, it is a common phenomenon.</b>

04:19.180 --> 04:21.280
<b>Humans without intelligence or talent</b>

04:21.730 --> 04:26.010
<b>end up in positions of power due 
to bloodline or connections.</b>

04:26.850 --> 04:29.180
<b>That defies all logic...</b>

04:29.630 --> 04:33.130
<b>In the hands of an incompetent, 
power brings nothing but ruin.</b>

04:33.130 --> 04:36.420
<b>This could only be the work of imbeciles.</b>

04:37.210 --> 04:40.410
<b>We must provide proper guidance.</b>

04:40.720 --> 04:41.420
<b>Absolutely.</b>

04:41.770 --> 04:44.720
<b>However, they serve as quality meat,</b>

04:44.720 --> 04:48.430
<b>and they are a self-renewing resource.</b>

04:48.430 --> 04:49.930
<b>They are an easy food source.</b>

04:50.400 --> 04:55.970
<b>The non-rare humans can be 
used to feed our soldiers.</b>

04:57.790 --> 05:00.690
<b>I shall use my godly power 
to deal divine punishment!</b>

05:00.690 --> 05:02.150
<b>Leave at once—</b>

05:07.670 --> 05:10.520
<b>Allow me to dispose of this.</b>

05:10.900 --> 05:13.400
<b>I can use it to control other humans.</b>

05:13.840 --> 05:15.390
<b>Do as you like.</b>

05:16.080 --> 05:17.460
<b>P-Please!</b>

05:18.180 --> 05:20.450
<b>S-Spare our lives.</b>

05:20.810 --> 05:22.460
<b>We beg you...</b>

05:26.400 --> 05:28.700
<b>These humans are idiots.</b>

05:29.400 --> 05:33.720
<b>Think as hard as those weak 
brains of yours can manage.</b>

05:34.130 --> 05:37.230
<b>Have you ever spared a pig or a cow</b>

05:38.220 --> 05:40.550
<b>as it begged for its life?</b>

05:48.200 --> 05:49.740
<b>The view is excellent.</b>

05:49.740 --> 05:51.530
<b>And there is plenty of space.</b>

05:53.320 --> 05:55.570
<b>I dub this place the Meat Plantation.</b>

05:55.570 --> 05:58.520
<b>It will be used for processing humans.</b>

05:58.900 --> 05:59.750
<b>As you command.</b>

06:02.700 --> 06:06.080
<b>After being defeated by Knuckle 
and Shoot, Gon and Killua</b>

06:06.080 --> 06:08.340
<b>return to the inn where Palm waits.</b>

06:10.420 --> 06:13.080
<b><i>Before I worry about enemies,</i></b>

06:13.080 --> 06:15.770
<b><i>I have to protect Gon from Palm.</i></b>

06:47.320 --> 06:50.900
<b>You must take responsibility.</b>

06:52.010 --> 06:53.430
<b>What?!</b>

06:54.400 --> 07:00.940
<b>You promised to take me to NGL...</b>

07:01.490 --> 07:05.410
<b>You said you'd swallow a thousand needles</b>

07:05.970 --> 07:07.820
<b>if you broke that promise.</b>

07:07.820 --> 07:09.820
<b>Uh-huh, I'm sorry.</b>

07:10.030 --> 07:13.300
<b>I don't want an apology...</b>

07:13.300 --> 07:17.850
<b>But there's no point in having you 
swallow a thousand needles.</b>

07:17.850 --> 07:18.870
<b>Yeah.</b>

07:18.870 --> 07:21.330
<b>So what can I do to make up for it?</b>

07:21.600 --> 07:23.020
<b>Let's see...</b>

07:24.240 --> 07:25.590
<b>You must...</b>

07:25.870 --> 07:29.690
<b>do any one thing I say.</b>

07:30.490 --> 07:31.520
<b>Hey!</b>

07:31.520 --> 07:33.200
<b>Right now, do you know how Gon feels—</b>

07:33.200 --> 07:34.850
<b>Okay, I agree!</b>

07:35.090 --> 07:37.100
<b>Go out with me.</b>

07:39.330 --> 07:43.600
<b>Go out with me...</b>

07:43.900 --> 07:44.780
<b>Eh?</b>

07:44.780 --> 07:45.670
<b>Okay.</b>

07:45.670 --> 07:46.720
<b>Huh?</b>

07:47.380 --> 07:50.730
<b>Do you have any idea what you're doing?!</b>

07:50.730 --> 07:54.620
<b>Yeah, but I did say I'd do anything.</b>

07:54.830 --> 07:58.370
<b>And you have no problem 
playing dirty like this?!</b>

07:58.370 --> 08:00.520
<b>This is none of your business.</b>

08:00.520 --> 08:03.270
<b>It's our problem.</b>

08:04.980 --> 08:08.380
<b>It's up to the two of us.</b>

08:12.530 --> 08:16.390
<b>You should stay away from her, Gon.</b>

08:16.390 --> 08:18.840
<b>Don't interrupt us!</b>

08:18.840 --> 08:21.390
<b>This is something the two 
of us must decide alone.</b>

08:21.390 --> 08:23.890
<b>You just want an excuse to say that!</b>

08:24.160 --> 08:26.380
<b>Just be quiet.</b>

08:26.380 --> 08:29.310
<b>We're going out now...</b>

08:30.000 --> 08:33.150
<b>There's somewhere I really want to go.</b>

08:33.400 --> 08:35.770
<b>Oh, sorry. I can't go out today.</b>

08:35.770 --> 08:36.670
<b>Eh?</b>

08:36.670 --> 08:38.910
<b>Today, I have to train with Killua.</b>

08:39.280 --> 08:40.320
<b>I know!</b>

08:40.320 --> 08:42.410
<b>You can train with us, Palm!</b>

08:42.760 --> 08:43.860
<b>Huh?</b>

08:44.600 --> 08:46.420
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

08:47.250 --> 08:51.010
<b>Didn't you say we'd go out?</b>

08:51.370 --> 08:52.420
<b>Uh-huh.</b>

08:52.420 --> 08:55.990
<b>Then, why is he tagging along?</b>

08:55.990 --> 08:57.480
<b>And why would we train?</b>

08:57.480 --> 08:58.800
<b>Are you toying with me?</b>

08:58.800 --> 08:59.920
<b>This will be a date...</b>

08:59.920 --> 09:01.680
<b>Our first date!</b>

09:01.680 --> 09:04.440
<b>The first date for us!</b>

09:04.840 --> 09:07.330
<b>The! First! Date!</b>

09:10.170 --> 09:12.160
<b>But it isn't a date.</b>

09:13.890 --> 09:15.060
<b>Huh?!</b>

09:15.060 --> 09:17.440
<b>We can have a proper date later.</b>

09:17.440 --> 09:20.370
<b>Since it's our first date, like you said.</b>

09:21.230 --> 09:22.450
<b><i>Wow...</i></b>

09:22.450 --> 09:25.460
<b><i>The word "date" keeps popping up.</i></b>

09:25.680 --> 09:29.520
<b>And I need time to prepare for it, too.</b>

09:29.520 --> 09:32.210
<b>Prepare? Prepare for what?</b>

09:32.210 --> 09:33.480
<b>That's...</b>

09:34.360 --> 09:36.710
<b>a secret.</b>

09:36.710 --> 09:38.970
<b>You get to find out tomorrow.</b>

09:39.910 --> 09:41.550
<b>Oh...</b>

09:41.550 --> 09:43.310
<b>In that case,</b>

09:44.590 --> 09:45.980
<b>it's fine.</b>

09:47.050 --> 09:48.170
<b>Really...</b>

09:48.170 --> 09:52.100
<b>If you'd explained first, 
I wouldn't have been so angry.</b>

09:52.100 --> 09:53.990
<b>Sorry about that.</b>

09:54.270 --> 09:57.740
<b>But I wanted to keep it secret, to surprise you!</b>

09:58.290 --> 10:00.980
<b>You wanted to surprise me?</b>

10:00.980 --> 10:02.670
<b>Gosh...</b>

10:04.580 --> 10:07.930
<b>Let's meet tomorrow, at 10 AM, 
in front of the bulletin board.</b>

10:07.930 --> 10:09.370
<b>I'll be there!</b>

10:11.420 --> 10:13.980
<b>Gon, you're amazing!</b>

10:13.980 --> 10:15.510
<b>Huh? What do you mean?</b>

10:15.920 --> 10:21.110
<b>Well, listening to you talk to Palm, 
you seemed used to this stuff.</b>

10:21.110 --> 10:22.010
<b>Really?</b>

10:25.770 --> 10:27.540
<b>I was wondering...</b>

10:27.990 --> 10:28.770
<b>Hmm?</b>

10:29.320 --> 10:31.310
<b>Have you been on a date before?</b>

10:31.310 --> 10:33.270
<b>Sure, I have.</b>

10:34.600 --> 10:37.570
<b>Well, most of them were with Mito-san.</b>

10:38.960 --> 10:40.750
<b>Oh, that makes sense...</b>

10:41.120 --> 10:43.610
<b>Wait, who else was there?</b>

10:43.610 --> 10:45.860
<b>Oh, some of the fishing boats</b>

10:45.860 --> 10:48.780
<b>that stopped at Whale Island were full of women,</b>

10:48.780 --> 10:51.580
<b>some of whom only liked younger men...</b>

10:51.980 --> 10:55.590
<b>So I took them around the village 
and had them teach me things.</b>

10:56.970 --> 10:59.140
<b><i>T-Teach him things?</i></b>

10:59.140 --> 11:00.790
<b><i>Th-That means...</i></b>

11:01.380 --> 11:02.620
<b><i>He's a grown-up!</i></b>

11:03.360 --> 11:06.470
<b>Women like that were called fanatics.</b>

11:07.580 --> 11:10.070
<b>Haven't you ever been on a date, Killua?</b>

11:11.220 --> 11:13.820
<b>No! Of course not...</b>

11:13.820 --> 11:16.220
<b>I spent all my time training as an assassin.</b>

11:16.690 --> 11:19.030
<b>And ever since I quit, I've been with you.</b>

11:19.030 --> 11:19.900
<b>Oh, yeah.</b>

11:19.900 --> 11:20.740
<b>Right!</b>

11:22.470 --> 11:25.620
<b><i>And I really don't want that to change...</i></b>

11:25.930 --> 11:30.120
<b><i>Somewhere down the line, 
you'll leave Gon behind to die.</i></b>

11:31.250 --> 11:34.620
<b><i>Damn, I'm about ready to give in...</i></b>

11:34.910 --> 11:36.920
<b><i>And this was my own decision...</i></b>

11:46.040 --> 11:47.140
<b>Hello?</b>

11:47.140 --> 11:48.140
<b>It's Knuckle.</b>

11:49.510 --> 11:51.560
<b>We've located and secured Kite.</b>

11:53.130 --> 11:55.820
<b>Really? Kite's okay?</b>

11:57.530 --> 11:58.650
<b>Knuckle?</b>

12:00.130 --> 12:05.660
<b>I believe that Kite's being controlled by the enemy.</b>

12:06.200 --> 12:10.160
<b>So I wouldn't say that he's okay.</b>

12:10.160 --> 12:11.570
<b>That's fine.</b>

12:11.570 --> 12:13.920
<b>There must be a way to bring him back!</b>

12:14.150 --> 12:18.610
<b>All right, it'll take three days to get back,</b>

12:18.610 --> 12:22.860
<b>so watch out for any soldier ants.</b>

12:22.860 --> 12:26.060
<b>It seems they've scattered far 
and wide, imitating the king.</b>

12:26.060 --> 12:27.240
<b>Got it.</b>

12:32.560 --> 12:34.700
<b>Yes!</b>

12:35.310 --> 12:38.160
<b>I knew that Kite was alive!</b>

12:38.160 --> 12:39.330
<b><i>That's great.</i></b>

12:40.810 --> 12:42.190
<b><i>All that's left</i></b>

12:43.330 --> 12:46.550
<b><i>is to protect you for a month.</i></b>

12:58.860 --> 13:00.480
<b>Wow!</b>

13:00.480 --> 13:02.560
<b>Look over here!</b>

13:05.450 --> 13:07.200
<b><i>I've found a new feeding ground.</i></b>

13:09.390 --> 13:10.470
<b>There we go.</b>

13:11.020 --> 13:12.850
<b>What's that for?</b>

13:13.790 --> 13:15.730
<b>It's a present for Palm.</b>

13:16.080 --> 13:17.720
<b>Are you sure about this?</b>

13:17.720 --> 13:21.160
<b>If you hand that to her, won't she freak out?</b>

13:22.480 --> 13:24.490
<b>If I just hand it to her, probably...</b>

13:24.880 --> 13:28.540
<b>Whatever... Let's get back to town.</b>

13:29.350 --> 13:30.400
<b>Yeah.</b>

13:37.450 --> 13:40.360
<b><i>If we encounter soldier ants 
here, in the mountains,</i></b>

13:41.020 --> 13:42.880
<b><i>we'll be in serious trouble.</i></b>

13:43.830 --> 13:49.430
<b><i>Likewise, if we stay in town, the risk of 
encountering ants looking for humans is high.</i></b>

13:49.820 --> 13:52.890
<b><i>But while other humans are being 
targeted, we can escape.</i></b>

13:54.260 --> 13:58.850
<b><i>After all, Gon can't currently use his </i>Nen...</b>

14:00.000 --> 14:02.350
<b><i>So I must protect him.</i></b>

14:02.960 --> 14:04.940
<b><i>Even if it means sacrificing everything else!</i></b>

14:18.320 --> 14:19.480

14:34.380 --> 14:35.880
<b>Drop your weapon,</b>

14:35.880 --> 14:37.620
<b>place your hands behind your head,</b>

<b>and lie down on the ground!</b>

14:39.880 --> 14:44.320
<b>If you don't comply within three

<b>Hmm?</b>

16:54.150 --> 16:56.580
<b>I didn't recognize you!</b>

16:56.910 --> 16:58.180
<b><i>Who are you?!</i></b>

16:59.910 --> 17:01.410
<b>Do I look strange?</b>

17:01.410 --> 17:04.380
<b>Nope, you look really pretty!</b>

17:04.380 --> 17:07.750
<b>Wait, stop it... You're too loud.</b>

17:07.750 --> 17:10.170
<b>You're embarrassing me...</b>

<b>What? I'm just telling the truth.</b>

17:13.290 --> 17:15.230

18:22.080 --> 18:23.080
<b><i>Something's there.</i></b>

18:24.040 --> 18:26.140
<b><i>This aura is probably from a soldier ant.</i></b>

18:26.650 --> 18:28.060
<b><i>It isn't that close,</i></b>

18:28.060 --> 18:30.420

18:31.460 --> 18:33.310
<b><i>There are faint aura traces around.</i></b>

18:33.850 --> 18:35.930
<b><i>Did it already pass through the area?</i></b>

18:35.930 --> 18:38.950
<b><i>Or were they brought here by the wind?</i></b>

18:39.690 --> 18:42.310
<b><i>Either way, there's a high 
risk our paths will cross!</i></b>

18:44.130 --> 18:45.850
<b><i>Should I warn them?</i></b>

18:47.670 --> 18:48.730
<b>We're here.</b>

18:48.730 --> 18:49.550
<b>Eh?</b>

19:00.270 --> 19:01.490
<b>It's beautiful...</b>

19:02.510 --> 19:03.240
<b><i>No,</i></b>

19:03.850 --> 19:06.940
<b><i>there's no point in telling them.</i></b>

19:07.760 --> 19:10.200
<b><i>Gon can't use his </i>Nen.</b>

<b><i>If he gets upset about Kite and flies 
off the handle with rage, he's finished.</i></b>

go nuts if I interrupt her date.</i></b>

19:28.150 --> 19:30.640

19:33.210 --> 19:35.030
<b><i>I can't let them know...</i></b>

19:49.000 --> 19:50.870
<b><i>I'll take care of this myself!</i></b>

20:34.860 --> 20:39.270

20:40.320 --> 20:41.340
<b><i>That's...</i></b>

20:43.510 --> 20:45.020
<b>I remember you.</b>

20:45.330 --> 20:48.380
<b>You're one of those kids from before!</b>

20:50.500 --> 20:52.850
<b>Looks like your luck's run out.</b>

20:53.700 --> 20:57.400
<b>You're about to get a taste of hell.</b>

20:57.550 --> 21:01.060
<b>But it won't last forever.</b>

21:01.600 --> 21:03.400
<b><i>I moved upwind to catch his attention</i></b>

21:03.940 --> 21:06.130
<b><i>and draw him away from them.</i></b>

21:06.130 --> 21:08.020
<b><i>I've done what I had to.</i></b>

21:08.800 --> 21:09.800
<b><i>But...</i></b>

21:10.740 --> 21:12.660
<b>Where's the other kid?</b>

21:13.050 --> 21:17.630
<b>Once you tell me his location, 
I'll give you an easy death.</b>

21:18.130 --> 21:21.070
<b>Well, he can't be that far away...</b>

21:22.010 --> 21:24.920
<b>He's your buddy, right?</b>

21:26.680 --> 21:30.100
<b>Well, it doesn't matter if you talk or not.</b>

21:30.610 --> 21:34.940
<b>I'll just walk around making lots of noise 
and swinging your severed head.</b>

21:35.350 --> 21:38.400
<b>Then he'll come to me himself.</b>

21:38.780 --> 21:41.170
<b>Isn't that how humans are?</b>

21:41.990 --> 21:43.750
<b><i>He's right.</i></b>

21:44.750 --> 21:46.860
<b><i>I have to defeat him,</i></b>

21:47.520 --> 21:48.700
<b><i>or it's all over!</i></b>

21:53.440 --> 21:57.760
<b><i>I'll do whatever it takes to protect Gon!</i></b>

<b>Next time: Friend x And x Journey.</b>

23:27.770 --> 23:29.800
<b>Going back to Whale Island with Killua...</b>

23:29.800 --> 23:31.540
<b>Looking up at the stars with Gon.</b>

<b>We're going on a journey!</b>
