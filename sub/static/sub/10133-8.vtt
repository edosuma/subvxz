07:56.226 --> 07:58.437
one jog around the block?

07:58.478 --> 07:59.771
Actually, I haven't run yet.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.815
I'm just really excited

07:59.813 --> 08:01.815
I found my stopwatch.

08:03.566 --> 08:06.653
All I need to win that race

08:03.566 --> 08:06.653
is a Tanner health shake

08:06.694 --> 08:09.406
and you wimps

08:06.694 --> 08:09.406
as my competition.

08:09.448 --> 08:11.241
Pretty tough talk coming

08:09.448 --> 08:11.241
from the cover boy

08:11.283 --> 08:13.660
to Geek Illustrated.

08:13.701 --> 08:15.662
Geek Illustrated.

08:18.415 --> 08:20.583
I say we put a bet on this race.

08:20.625 --> 08:24.045
Bet? You got it, pal.

08:20.625 --> 08:24.045
You name it, and I'll claim it.

08:24.921 --> 08:27.174
Okay, you puny girlie-men.

08:28.758 --> 08:31.136
Hear me now,

08:28.758 --> 08:31.136
think about it later.

08:32.553 --> 08:35.390
Tomorrow is the school

08:32.553 --> 08:35.390
Halloween carnival.

08:35.432 --> 08:37.392
I say that the losers

08:35.432 --> 08:37.392
have to wear

08:37.434 --> 08:40.020
whatever costumes

08:37.434 --> 08:40.020
that the winner picks.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.817
So, Mr. Bear,

08:44.232 --> 08:45.817
when do you think

08:45.859 --> 08:49.321
D.J. will come

08:45.859 --> 08:49.321
to her senses and apologize?

08:49.363 --> 08:52.073
When that bear

08:49.363 --> 08:52.073
answers you out loud.

08:53.283 --> 08:56.911
On behalf of Mr. Bear, how rude.

08:59.498 --> 09:02.250
[glugging]

09:03.293 --> 09:05.795
Must you<i> glug</i> your milk?

09:05.837 --> 09:07.381
Does it bother you?

09:08.840 --> 09:11.551
- Yes.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.551
- Then, I must.

09:13.136 --> 09:15.930
[glugging]

09:15.972 --> 09:18.517
Look, I cannot

09:15.972 --> 09:18.517
take this anymore.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.811
Let's just pretend to make up,

09:18.558 --> 09:21.811
and then dad will be happy.

09:21.853 --> 09:24.398
- Great idea.

09:21.853 --> 09:24.398
- Let me do the talking.

09:24.439 --> 09:25.606
I'm smarter than you.

09:25.648 --> 09:27.234
If you were so smart,

09:25.648 --> 09:27.234
you would've

09:27.275 --> 09:29.236
thought of this

09:27.275 --> 09:29.236
three hours ago.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.112
[knock on the door]

09:31.154 --> 09:32.197
(Danny)

09:31.154 --> 09:32.197
'Can I come in, girls?'

09:32.239 --> 09:33.448
Just a minute.

09:33.490 --> 09:35.200
Get over here

09:33.490 --> 09:35.200
and start laughing.

09:37.994 --> 09:40.455
Oh, sure. Come in, dad.

09:42.249 --> 09:46.002
Oh, now this sounds better.

09:42.249 --> 09:46.002
You two have a little talk?

09:46.044 --> 09:48.755
Yeah, we decided

09:46.044 --> 09:48.755
to chill-out and get along.

09:48.796 --> 09:50.215
Right.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.133
Did you, uh, hug yet?

09:53.552 --> 09:56.513
We were saving that for you.

09:56.555 --> 09:59.349
- Come here, little sis.

09:56.555 --> 09:59.349
- I'm coming, big sis.

10:02.477 --> 10:05.146
Aw! Thanks for waiting.

10:05.188 --> 10:07.524
Okay, your punishment's over.

10:07.566 --> 10:10.277
I'm off to the gym to get

10:07.566 --> 10:10.277
pumped for the big race.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.445
See you later, girls.

10:11.486 --> 10:13.321
- Bye, dad.

10:16.450 --> 10:17.742
(together)

10:16.450 --> 10:17.742
Ew!

10:19.453 --> 10:23.664
Well, thank goodness I have

10:19.453 --> 10:23.664
another sister, a<i> good</i> sister.

10:23.706 --> 10:26.543
- So go live with her.

10:23.706 --> 10:26.543
- Maybe I will.

10:26.585 --> 10:28.878
Maybe I'll get

10:26.585 --> 10:28.878
a divorce from you.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.256
You wanna divorce?

10:28.920 --> 10:31.256
You got it.

10:31.298 --> 10:34.468
Fine. Then I'll go tell Michelle

10:31.298 --> 10:34.468
I'm moving in with her.

10:34.509 --> 10:37.512
And I'll go call Kimmy

10:34.509 --> 10:37.512
and tell her I have my own room.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.139
Not so fast.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.766
Half of everything

10:39.180 --> 10:41.766
in this room is mine.

10:45.353 --> 10:47.439
[instrumental music]

10:51.568 --> 10:55.530
In my old room,

10:51.568 --> 10:55.530
D.J. was the big sister.

10:55.572 --> 10:59.367
But in this room,

10:55.572 --> 10:59.367
<i>I'm</i> the big sister.

10:59.409 --> 11:02.621
So there are only two words

10:59.409 --> 11:02.621
you need to know.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.498
Okay, boss.

11:04.539 --> 11:06.416
Okay, boss.

11:07.584 --> 11:10.253
Ooh, this is gonna be so sweet.

11:14.673 --> 11:15.758
Just came in to say

11:15.800 --> 11:17.511
"Good Golly, Miss Molly"

11:17.552 --> 11:19.095
what's your bed doing in here?

11:19.137 --> 11:22.307
I decided it was time

11:19.137 --> 11:22.307
for D.J. to have her own room.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.933
Yeah, I don't know how much

11:22.349 --> 11:23.933
she paid you but you give

11:23.975 --> 11:25.726
her that money back, right now.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.646
It was my idea.

11:27.686 --> 11:28.813
Alright, well,

11:27.686 --> 11:28.813
it's fine with me.

11:28.855 --> 11:29.897
But I'm gonna have a little chat

11:29.939 --> 11:31.191
with your dad when he gets home.

11:31.232 --> 11:32.817
Goodnight. Goodnight.

11:32.859 --> 11:35.320
- Goodnight, Uncle Jesse.

11:32.859 --> 11:35.320
- Now you girls get some sleep.

11:35.362 --> 11:38.948
- Okay, boss.

11:35.362 --> 11:38.948
- What? I'm the boss?

11:39.698 --> 11:41.117
She's the boss.

11:42.827 --> 11:45.246
Where do these kids

11:42.827 --> 11:45.246
get this stuff?

11:48.416 --> 11:50.043
Go to sleep, munchkins.

11:51.002 --> 11:52.295
Goodnight, boss.

11:55.298 --> 11:57.008
Hi, Uncle Jesse.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.553
I see you're not missing

11:57.050 --> 11:59.553
Stephanie too badly.

12:00.261 --> 12:01.471
Stephanie who?

12:14.942 --> 12:18.405
Michelle, did you just

12:14.942 --> 12:18.405
hit me on the head?

12:19.072 --> 12:20.407
Who, me?

12:22.283 --> 12:24.035
Go back to sleep.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.453
I'm the boss.

12:28.540 --> 12:32.751
I'm the boss, I'm the boss,

12:28.540 --> 12:32.751
I'm the boss.

12:32.793 --> 12:34.921
I'm in trouble.

12:34.962 --> 12:36.673
I'm the boss, I'm the boss.

12:36.715 --> 12:38.799
[instrumental music]

12:40.260 --> 12:43.804
Out goes the bad air,

12:40.260 --> 12:43.804
in comes the good.

12:43.846 --> 12:47.016
Out goes the bad air,

12:43.846 --> 12:47.016
in comes the good.

12:47.058 --> 12:49.352
Joey, you want a jellyroll?

12:49.394 --> 12:51.312
Scratch that,

12:49.394 --> 12:51.312
you already got one.

12:55.066 --> 12:56.901
Hi, guys.

12:56.943 --> 12:58.653
Becky, what's our

12:56.943 --> 12:58.653
crew doin' here?

12:58.695 --> 13:01.155
Well, Danny, I know how

12:58.695 --> 13:01.155
you love my little surprises.

13:01.197 --> 13:03.324
I never love

13:01.197 --> 13:03.324
your little surprises.

13:03.366 --> 13:05.285
- Roll tape.

13:03.366 --> 13:05.285
- 'Rolling.'

13:05.326 --> 13:08.246
Okay, all you lucky viewers

13:05.326 --> 13:08.246
of "Wake Up, San Francisco"

13:08.288 --> 13:10.123
we have a special

13:08.288 --> 13:10.123
treat for you

13:10.164 --> 13:12.208
a rare glimpse

13:10.164 --> 13:12.208
into the athletic

13:12.250 --> 13:14.711
macho-jock side

13:12.250 --> 13:14.711
of Danny Tanner.

13:14.753 --> 13:16.170
I'm just running

13:14.753 --> 13:16.170
a friendly little race

13:16.212 --> 13:18.005
here with my buddies,

13:16.212 --> 13:18.005
it's-it's just

13:18.047 --> 13:19.716
once around the track

13:18.047 --> 13:19.716
and it's not worth

13:19.758 --> 13:22.218
getting a whole segment

13:19.758 --> 13:22.218
on our show with this.

13:22.260 --> 13:23.553
Oh, I think it is.

13:23.595 --> 13:25.972
Okay, get that camera

13:23.595 --> 13:25.972
car into position.

13:26.013 --> 13:27.223
Camera car?

13:27.265 --> 13:29.350
Gentlemen, to the starting line.

13:29.392 --> 13:31.394
Let's do it, boys.

13:29.392 --> 13:31.394
This is it. This is it.

13:31.436 --> 13:34.314
- I got this.

13:31.436 --> 13:34.314
- Wait.

13:35.774 --> 13:37.609
Look, uh, guys,

13:35.774 --> 13:37.609
you gotta let me win.

13:37.651 --> 13:40.361
- I can't lose on my own show.

13:37.651 --> 13:40.361
- I can't let you win.

13:40.403 --> 13:42.821
Remember, the winners gets to

13:40.403 --> 13:42.821
make the losers wear costumes

13:42.863 --> 13:44.699
to Stephanie's

13:42.863 --> 13:44.699
Halloween carnival.

13:44.741 --> 13:49.120
I already got yours picked out.

13:44.741 --> 13:49.120
Big Bird, meet Snuffleupagus.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.038
- On your mark..

13:49.162 --> 13:51.038
- Here we go.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.624
Get set..

13:52.666 --> 13:53.792
...go!

13:54.875 --> 13:57.170
And they're off.

13:57.211 --> 13:59.464
Danny is off

13:57.211 --> 13:59.464
to a lightning start.

13:59.506 --> 14:00.881
Boy, if he continues

13:59.506 --> 14:00.881
at this pace

14:00.923 --> 14:03.217
he could break

14:00.923 --> 14:03.217
the world record.

14:03.259 --> 14:05.886
'He's movin'. He's movin'.'

14:07.138 --> 14:09.516
- Peep peep.

14:07.138 --> 14:09.516
- What are you doing here?

14:09.557 --> 14:10.849
I gotta win this race.

14:10.891 --> 14:13.227
Then I suggest you

14:10.891 --> 14:13.227
run faster than us.

14:16.022 --> 14:19.025
Oh, now he looks like

14:16.022 --> 14:19.025
the Danny Tanner I know.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.569
[breathing heavily]

14:21.611 --> 14:24.864
You guys...aren't

14:21.611 --> 14:24.864
getting...tired, are you?

14:24.905 --> 14:26.199
- No, not at all.

14:24.905 --> 14:26.199
- Not me.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.743
Me either.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.411
For those of you at home

14:28.785 --> 14:30.411
who think you're watching

14:30.453 --> 14:31.871
a slow-motion replay

14:31.912 --> 14:33.581
do not be fooled.

14:33.623 --> 14:36.209
They are actually

14:33.623 --> 14:36.209
moving at this speed.

14:37.544 --> 14:40.797
Guys, let's all cross

14:37.544 --> 14:40.797
the finish line together.

14:40.839 --> 14:43.508
That way, everybody saves face.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.134
Fine with me.

14:45.176 --> 14:49.055
To stop this pain in my side,

14:45.176 --> 14:49.055
I'm all for it.

14:49.096 --> 14:52.099
They're neck and neck and neck.

14:52.141 --> 14:54.769
Come on, you turtles!

14:54.811 --> 14:57.313
That's my girlfriend

14:54.811 --> 14:57.313
calling me a turtle.

14:57.355 --> 15:01.192
- Sorry, Danny.

14:57.355 --> 15:01.192
- I'm not losing this bet.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.236
I already rented costumes.

15:03.277 --> 15:06.113
It's my show.

15:03.277 --> 15:06.113
I gotta win.

15:09.116 --> 15:11.285
Hey, it looks like

15:09.116 --> 15:11.285
we've got a race!

15:11.327 --> 15:14.581
And here they come.

15:11.327 --> 15:14.581
It's gonna be a photo finish.

15:18.209 --> 15:21.295
[panting]

15:23.423 --> 15:26.843
Gentlemen, any comments?

15:26.885 --> 15:29.053
[breathing heavily]

15:30.805 --> 15:32.473
I think what they're

15:30.805 --> 15:32.473
trying to say is

15:32.515 --> 15:34.975
We should've run

15:32.515 --> 15:34.975
a shorter race.

15:35.017 --> 15:37.604
Oh, and here comes the picture.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.313
And the winner is..

15:39.355 --> 15:41.524
'...Danny Tanner by a nose!'

15:43.234 --> 15:47.238
Danny, to what do you attribute

15:43.234 --> 15:47.238
that last surge of power?

15:47.280 --> 15:49.699
Fear of public humiliation.

15:49.741 --> 15:52.993
And to my worthy opponents,

15:49.741 --> 15:52.993
all I can say now is

15:53.035 --> 15:54.829
trick or treat, boys!

15:56.873 --> 15:58.374
That's a wrap.

15:58.917 --> 16:00.334
And a nap.

16:01.252 --> 16:02.712
[indistinct chatter]

16:02.754 --> 16:05.131
- Hey, Deej.

16:02.754 --> 16:05.131
- Hey, what happened?

16:05.172 --> 16:07.675
- I won the race.

16:05.172 --> 16:07.675
- Alright!

16:07.717 --> 16:10.929
Well, not all of him won.

16:07.717 --> 16:10.929
Just his nose.

16:12.806 --> 16:14.432
What a night?

16:15.433 --> 16:16.726
You look trashed.

16:16.768 --> 16:19.228
That's because

16:16.768 --> 16:19.228
living with Michelle

16:19.270 --> 16:22.189
is a nightmare

16:19.270 --> 16:22.189
on Sesame Street.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.402
Dad, I want my room back.

16:26.444 --> 16:29.489
[clicks tongue]

16:26.444 --> 16:29.489
No way. It was

16:26.444 --> 16:29.489
so wonderful waking up

16:29.530 --> 16:33.117
to the birds chirping instead

16:29.530 --> 16:33.117
of you blowing your nose.

16:34.201 --> 16:35.495
Whoa, girls, what happened

16:35.536 --> 16:37.497
to that beautiful hug

16:35.536 --> 16:37.497
I saw last night?

16:37.538 --> 16:38.915
It was a fake hug.

16:40.082 --> 16:43.043
A fake hug? In my house?

16:43.085 --> 16:45.212
It was D.J.'s idea.

16:46.255 --> 16:48.758
You little weasel.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.093
- I want my room back.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.093
- So take me to court.

16:51.135 --> 16:53.471
I will! I'll take you

16:51.135 --> 16:53.471
to People's Court.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.223
Wait a minute.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.223
We don't need Judge Wapner.

16:56.265 --> 16:58.852
We have Judge Tanner.

16:56.265 --> 16:58.852
Now here's an idea.

16:58.893 --> 17:01.646
We'll have our own court

16:58.893 --> 17:01.646
right here in our living room

17:01.688 --> 17:03.481
to decide who

17:01.688 --> 17:03.481
is living with who.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.107
Great, and Joey and I

17:03.523 --> 17:05.107
will be the lawyers.

17:05.149 --> 17:06.776
That is a great idea.

17:06.818 --> 17:09.111
The court appoint Mr. Katsopolis

17:06.818 --> 17:09.111
to represent Stephanie

17:09.153 --> 17:11.698
and Mr. Gladstone

17:09.153 --> 17:11.698
to represent D.J.

17:11.739 --> 17:13.491
'I expect you to tell

17:11.739 --> 17:13.491
the whole truth.'

17:13.533 --> 17:16.327
Alright, court

17:13.533 --> 17:16.327
is now in session.

17:17.662 --> 17:20.247
Defense, please call

17:17.662 --> 17:20.247
your first witness.

17:20.289 --> 17:21.541
Your Honor, I call

17:21.582 --> 17:24.002
Donna Jo Tanner

17:21.582 --> 17:24.002
to the stand, please.

17:25.879 --> 17:28.422
Donna Jo, please

17:25.879 --> 17:28.422
tell the court why

17:28.464 --> 17:30.257
you no longer wish

17:28.464 --> 17:30.257
to share your room

17:30.299 --> 17:32.092
with your perky

17:30.299 --> 17:32.092
little sister.

17:32.134 --> 17:35.388
Objection, Your Honor.

17:35.429 --> 17:38.683
Please instruct counsel not to

17:35.429 --> 17:38.683
characterize the plaintiff.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.895
- How do you know all that junk?

17:38.725 --> 17:41.895
- I love those lawyer shows.

17:43.563 --> 17:47.274
D.J., please tell the court what

17:43.563 --> 17:47.274
your problem is with Stephanie.

17:47.316 --> 17:51.571
It's simple. She's in elementary

17:47.316 --> 17:51.571
school, I'm in junior high.

17:51.612 --> 17:53.197
We have nothing in common.

17:53.239 --> 17:56.242
And I really need my privacy

17:53.239 --> 17:56.242
to make phone calls

17:56.283 --> 17:57.827
to put on makeup.

17:57.869 --> 18:00.747
But every time I turn around,

17:57.869 --> 18:00.747
there she is.

18:01.956 --> 18:04.458
There must be five

18:01.956 --> 18:04.458
or six of her.

18:06.335 --> 18:08.212
Thank you, Donna Jo.

18:08.254 --> 18:09.964
Your witness, counsel.

18:13.342 --> 18:16.220
Ms. Tanner, you have

18:13.342 --> 18:16.220
just stated on the record

18:16.262 --> 18:18.723
that you have nothing

18:16.262 --> 18:18.723
in common with my client.

18:18.765 --> 18:22.142
But isn't it true

18:18.765 --> 18:22.142
that Wednesday<i> last</i>

18:22.184 --> 18:25.521
you were found playing Barbie

18:22.184 --> 18:25.521
dolls with young Stephanie?

18:25.563 --> 18:28.357
Well, there's nothing else

18:25.563 --> 18:28.357
to do. I-it was raining and--

18:28.399 --> 18:30.359
No further questions,

18:28.399 --> 18:30.359
Your Honor.

18:31.903 --> 18:33.195
I'd like to call

18:33.237 --> 18:34.989
Stephanie Judith Tanner

18:33.237 --> 18:34.989
to the stand.

18:40.661 --> 18:43.957
I can't live with Michelle.

18:40.661 --> 18:43.957
I'll go nuts.

18:43.998 --> 18:46.584
- Please wait for the question.

18:43.998 --> 18:46.584
- Sorry.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.753
So why can't you

18:46.626 --> 18:48.753
live with Michelle?

18:48.795 --> 18:52.381
- I'll go nuts!

18:48.795 --> 18:52.381
- No further questions.

18:52.423 --> 18:55.217
I have a question. Why did you

18:52.423 --> 18:55.217
move out in the first place?

18:55.259 --> 18:57.261
Because I can't live with D.J.

18:57.303 --> 18:58.972
at least not this D.J.

18:59.013 --> 19:02.683
I miss the old D.J.,

18:59.013 --> 19:02.683
the one who used to like me.

19:03.350 --> 19:04.435
Steph..

19:05.853 --> 19:07.688
...it's not that

19:05.853 --> 19:07.688
I don't like you.

19:07.730 --> 19:09.231
It's just that

19:07.730 --> 19:09.231
I'd like you better

19:09.273 --> 19:11.609
if you were in a different room.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.778
Well, that is just

19:11.651 --> 19:13.778
not gonna happen.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.321
Michelle is still very young

19:15.362 --> 19:17.156
and I don't want her to have

19:15.362 --> 19:17.156
a roommate right now.

19:17.907 --> 19:19.575
Stephanie..

19:19.617 --> 19:23.621
...you have to realize that

19:19.617 --> 19:23.621
D.J. is becoming a young woman.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.915
Things aren't gonna be exactly

19:23.663 --> 19:25.915
the way they were.

19:25.957 --> 19:28.876
- You have to understand that.

19:25.957 --> 19:28.876
- Okay.

19:28.918 --> 19:30.795
And D.J.,

19:28.918 --> 19:30.795
you have to understand

19:30.837 --> 19:32.713
that Stephanie is still

19:30.837 --> 19:32.713
gonna be your roommate.

19:32.755 --> 19:35.466
So you have to find some way

19:32.755 --> 19:35.466
to get along with her.

19:35.508 --> 19:36.884
[clicks tongue]

19:35.508 --> 19:36.884
Okay.

19:36.926 --> 19:39.386
Girls, I-I realize this

19:36.926 --> 19:39.386
five-year age difference

19:39.428 --> 19:41.764
seems like a lot now,

19:39.428 --> 19:41.764
but before you know it

19:41.806 --> 19:43.557
it won't mean a thing.

19:43.599 --> 19:45.143
You know, some day, girls,

19:43.599 --> 19:45.143
you're gonna realize

19:45.184 --> 19:47.145
just how lucky you are

19:45.184 --> 19:47.145
to have one another.

19:50.523 --> 19:53.317
Okay, let's move Stephanie's

19:50.523 --> 19:53.317
stuff back into her room.

19:55.277 --> 19:57.488
- Let's go.

19:55.277 --> 19:57.488
- Can't we play more lawyer?

19:58.865 --> 20:00.950
[instrumental music]

20:02.576 --> 20:04.411
So, Mr. Bear,

20:02.576 --> 20:04.411
do you think anyone else

20:04.453 --> 20:06.372
will be dressed

20:04.453 --> 20:06.372
as Batman this year?

20:07.915 --> 20:10.292
Ha ha ha.

20:13.253 --> 20:16.632
Boy, I'm gonna get tired

20:13.253 --> 20:16.632
of doing this laugh all night.

20:17.591 --> 20:21.220
Well, have fun at your party.

20:21.261 --> 20:24.765
Why are you moping around?

20:21.261 --> 20:24.765
You love the carnival.

20:24.807 --> 20:27.810
Yeah, but it's gonna be

20:24.807 --> 20:27.810
my first carnival without<i> you.</i>

20:28.519 --> 20:31.022
I don't get it.

20:31.064 --> 20:33.524
Why do you wanna hang out

20:31.064 --> 20:33.524
with me so much?

20:34.274 --> 20:36.110
Well, the truth is

20:36.152 --> 20:38.612
I like to hang out

20:36.152 --> 20:38.612
with you because

20:38.654 --> 20:40.698
I wanna be just like you.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.659
You're smart and pretty

20:40.740 --> 20:43.659
and really cool.

20:43.701 --> 20:45.327
Wouldn't you wanna

20:43.701 --> 20:45.327
hang out with you?

20:46.495 --> 20:48.414
Can't argue with any of that.

20:50.124 --> 20:52.459
I guess some times

20:50.124 --> 20:52.459
I like hanging out with you too.

20:53.169 --> 20:54.962
Really? How come?

20:57.006 --> 20:59.175
Well, you're a little nutty,

20:59.217 --> 21:01.260
but you always make me laugh

21:01.301 --> 21:03.596
and you have definite

21:01.301 --> 21:03.596
cool potential.

21:05.472 --> 21:08.434
Tell you what, I'll go to that

21:05.472 --> 21:08.434
Halloween carnival with you

21:08.475 --> 21:10.477
and I'll go

21:08.475 --> 21:10.477
to my party later.

21:10.519 --> 21:13.480
Really? Oh, thanks, D.J.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.233
Hold that hug.

21:16.483 --> 21:18.861
[sighs]

21:16.483 --> 21:18.861
I don't want a roommate.

21:19.820 --> 21:22.240
But, since I have to have one..

21:22.281 --> 21:24.951
...I guess I couldn't

21:22.281 --> 21:24.951
think of anyone better than you.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.244
Wow!

21:26.285 --> 21:28.579
Two nice things in a row!

21:29.663 --> 21:32.083
- Now?

21:29.663 --> 21:32.083
- Now.
