00:00.568 --> 00:02.001
 Liv: <i> Previously on</i> izombie...

00:02.003 --> 00:03.469
   You are who you eat.

00:03.471 --> 00:04.937
     <i> You don't just</i>
     <i> have their visions,</i>

00:04.939 --> 00:06.638
 <i> You also get some of their</i>
 <i> personality traits.</i>

00:06.640 --> 00:08.841
  Eddie never came home.
  And now jerome's missing.

00:08.843 --> 00:10.943
 The skate park guy that jerome
 was talking about?

00:10.945 --> 00:12.811
  He called him the candyman.

00:12.813 --> 00:14.880
   <i> Can we not go down there</i>
   <i> and just check him out</i>
   <i> or something?</i>

00:14.882 --> 00:16.114
        Clive: <i> Don't do</i>
       <i> anything stupid.</i>

00:20.154 --> 00:22.554
    <i> What do you mean,</i>
    <i> kids are going missing?</i>
    <i> How many?</i>

00:24.692 --> 00:25.991
     I met another zombie.

00:25.993 --> 00:27.993
        Ravi: <i> Friendly?</i>
        Liv: <i> Quite.</i>

00:27.995 --> 00:30.029
  If you want to find a cure
  you have to know how
  a disease defends itself.

00:30.031 --> 00:31.697
      Wait. You think you
      can cure this?

00:31.699 --> 00:33.532
  You were expecting
  to stay like this forever?

00:36.804 --> 00:38.303
          (laughing)

00:40.341 --> 00:42.674
   Yuck it up, lightweight.

00:42.676 --> 00:45.511
 You just want me to empty the
 bottle so we can spin it.

00:45.513 --> 00:48.547
  You're not serious.
  What's next,
  "seven minutes in heaven"?

00:48.549 --> 00:51.050
     Three minutes...
     Thank you very much.

00:54.355 --> 00:55.954
          -(groaning)
          -(gasping)

01:00.194 --> 01:01.894
       Girl: Oh, my god.
       Is she okay?

01:01.896 --> 01:03.028
  Girl 2: Do something, kyle!

01:03.030 --> 01:03.829
   Boy: We need to help her.

01:11.105 --> 01:14.106
     Oh, my god!
     You know who this is?

01:14.108 --> 01:15.507
       Emily sparrow...

01:16.777 --> 01:18.343
          Help us...

01:22.716 --> 01:24.516
      (theme song playing)

01:48.442 --> 01:51.810
   Emily sparrow passed
   away early this morning,
   from exposure and shock.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.812
    Doctors were, however,

01:53.814 --> 01:57.449
 Able to save her baby,
 who continues to be
 monitored at st. Thomas' nicu.

01:57.451 --> 02:00.085
       So, many assumed
       the boyfriend,
       dylan munson,

02:00.087 --> 02:02.721
 Killed her when he found out
 that she was pregnant
 with his kid.

02:02.723 --> 02:05.290
   Does this new information
   exonerate him?

02:05.292 --> 02:07.559
 We're not ruling anything out.

02:07.561 --> 02:11.230
  Our task force will
  exhaust all resources
  to find out what happened.

02:11.232 --> 02:15.400
 So it's "all hands on deck"
 for the upper-middle class
 white girl who's already dead,

02:15.402 --> 02:18.103
   Yet you won't assign even
   one detective to look
   into the missing kids

02:18.105 --> 02:20.072
 From nine trolls skate park?

02:20.074 --> 02:23.609
  -Where's their task force?
  -Missing persons is
  looking into that case.

02:23.611 --> 02:25.844
     This briefing is
     about emily sparrow.

02:25.846 --> 02:27.346
    That's all. Thank you.

02:49.170 --> 02:53.172
           (sobbing)

02:53.174 --> 02:54.673
  I assure you,
  we will treat your daughter

02:54.675 --> 02:55.707
   With the utmost respect.

02:58.846 --> 03:01.313
     Mr. And mrs. Sparrow,
     sorry for your loss.

03:01.315 --> 03:04.550
      Clive babineaux.
      I'm assigned to
      emily's task force.

03:04.552 --> 03:07.519
   If you think of anything
   relevant to the case,

03:07.521 --> 03:09.821
    -I'm at your disposal.
    -Dylan munson's
    responsible for this,

03:09.823 --> 03:11.823
      One way or another.

03:11.825 --> 03:13.425
 That's the only relevant thing
 you need to know.

03:14.562 --> 03:15.460
     Come on, sweetheart.
     Let's go.

03:23.871 --> 03:26.872
 -He seems pretty certain.
 -Well, he's not the only one.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.674
      Everyone liked the
      boyfriend for this.

03:28.676 --> 03:30.842
    Just couldn't find
    any evidence,
    on him or anyone else.

03:30.844 --> 03:31.877
    Homicide's got nothing.

03:39.086 --> 03:41.920
    We still haven't had
    anyone come to fix our
    id card reader.

03:41.922 --> 03:45.691
  It's been months!
  This is a restricted area.

03:45.693 --> 03:48.260
 Ugh. I've seen florists with
 better security.

03:49.396 --> 03:51.730
 That would be great. Thanks.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.367
   They're sending someone.

03:55.369 --> 03:57.402
  Ten calls. Ten versions of,

03:57.404 --> 03:59.071
      "why does a morgue
      need security?

03:59.073 --> 04:01.006
 "it's not like the bodies are
 just gonna walk away."

04:01.008 --> 04:03.775
  Well, did you explain that
   we're not so much worried
  about the dead walking away

04:03.777 --> 04:05.444
        As the undead
        walking back in?

04:05.446 --> 04:08.046
 I don't want blaine showing up
 unannounced again, either.

04:08.048 --> 04:10.282
    But whatever he's
    doing at nine trolls,
    our saving grace is that

04:10.284 --> 04:12.184
      He still needs you
      looking for a cure.

04:12.186 --> 04:14.953
     For all the advantages
     zombie-ism gives him,

04:14.955 --> 04:17.623
  Nothing is worth an eternity
  of eating brains. Trust me.

04:17.625 --> 04:22.060
    Okay. Severely
    sprained ankle, recent.

04:22.062 --> 04:24.863
    She couldn't have
    traveled far
    to reach that campsite.

04:24.865 --> 04:26.565
     Did you hear anything
     about the baby?

04:26.567 --> 04:29.434
   Apparently,
   he's quite healthy.
   Lacerations, both palms...

04:29.436 --> 04:31.303
      I wonder what
      they're feeding him.

04:31.305 --> 04:34.773
  -Broken thumb, right hand.
  -How long is he going to be
         in the nicu?

04:34.775 --> 04:37.242
       Until dylan munson
       claims custody.

04:37.244 --> 04:39.244
     There's not much here
     to go off, i'm afraid,

04:39.246 --> 04:41.480
  I mean, aside from the
  injuries probably sustained
  from trying to hike

04:41.482 --> 04:43.382
 Through a forest in the dark.

04:43.384 --> 04:46.451
    Stomach full of water,
    moderate malnourishment.

04:48.155 --> 04:49.955
   I should get a sample
   of her intestinal tissue.

04:54.161 --> 04:56.061
  Though not remotely sexual,

04:56.063 --> 04:57.896
     -That's got to be some
     form of harassment.
     -Watch your fingers.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.498
     That scalpel is sharp.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.733
 I'd say emily's
 brain effects are taking hold.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.969
    Specifically, the fierce
    maternal instinct

05:03.971 --> 05:05.637
  That kicks in
  just prior to giving birth.

05:08.175 --> 05:10.742
  Why don't you call it a day?
  Unless you have the urge
  to make me lunch,

05:10.744 --> 05:13.412
       -Or do my laundry.
       -You wish.

05:13.414 --> 05:14.780
        Have you really
        not eaten lunch?

05:14.782 --> 05:16.682
        Please let this
        conversation end

05:16.684 --> 05:18.450
  With you cutting the crusts
  off a peanut butter
  and jelly sandwich.

05:18.452 --> 05:19.418
       That's not funny.

05:21.455 --> 05:23.722
     Are you really hungry,
     though, seriously?

05:24.525 --> 05:26.825
 I think i'm done for the day.

05:26.827 --> 05:30.195
 But you should eat something.
 Possibly with vegetables.
 If you so choose.

05:31.098 --> 05:32.431
     Okay. I'm leaving now.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.737
     (baby crying faintly)

05:43.444 --> 05:47.779
 Oh, isn't this a rare treat.
 I can't remember the last time

05:47.781 --> 05:49.381
        I had a surprise
        visit from you.

05:51.218 --> 05:53.819
 Kind of makes you want to have
 one of your own, doesn't it?

05:53.821 --> 05:55.954
 She hasn't picked him up yet.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.790
   The nurse. He's not crying
   but he's awake.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.959
      He needs to be held.

06:00.961 --> 06:03.829
   Give me two minutes to
   reschedule my meeting,
   and then we'll grab lunch.

06:03.831 --> 06:05.697
    We just did the autopsy
    on his mother.

06:05.699 --> 06:10.235
  Oh. I'm sorry. I assumed...

06:10.237 --> 06:12.471
   -You're here for the baby.
   -I was going to
   come see you, mom.

06:12.473 --> 06:15.474
      That's fine.
      Pediatric medicine.

06:15.476 --> 06:18.977
 Now that's a wonderful
 application for your talents.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.479
 Questioning my life choices...

06:20.481 --> 06:22.180
     A familiar application
     of yours.

06:22.182 --> 06:24.249
     I'm your mother,
     it's part of the deal.

06:24.251 --> 06:25.917
      I have your best
      interests at heart.

06:25.919 --> 06:26.918
      You could, for once,
      just listen to me.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.891
 -I'm sick of listening to you!
 -Emily!

06:32.893 --> 06:34.159
      It's all good, dude.

06:34.161 --> 06:35.327
      I was already done.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.929
            (grunts)

06:37.931 --> 06:39.865
 Emily: What are you gonna do,
 lock me in here forever?

06:39.867 --> 06:40.665
           Watch us!

06:42.870 --> 06:45.871
    I mean, mes get breaks
    for lunch, don't they?
    Would it kill you to...

06:45.873 --> 06:48.073
        Rain check, mom.
        I have to go.

06:56.350 --> 06:59.351
    Okay. All right, listen,
    i gotta go. Bye.

06:59.353 --> 07:01.720
        I had a vision.

07:01.722 --> 07:04.456
   I think emily's parents
   locked her up to
   keep her away from dylan,

07:04.458 --> 07:06.291
      And held her captive
      for eight months.

07:06.293 --> 07:08.460
      So they find out
      she's pregnant,
      go off the deep end.

07:08.462 --> 07:10.562
      As plausible as any
      other theory so far,

07:10.564 --> 07:12.197
     But i can't pursue it.
     Not yet.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.533
   -Why not?
   -The sparrows are
   detective flynn's detail.

07:14.535 --> 07:16.701
   I'm part of a task force,
   remember?

07:16.703 --> 07:18.570
     I've been assigned to
     dylan's interrogation.
     And i'm late.

07:18.572 --> 07:19.938
        All right, fine.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.274
     -Let's talk to dylan.
     -Suzuki's lead.

07:22.276 --> 07:24.776
  The best i can do is
  let you watch from
  the observation room, okay?

07:24.778 --> 07:28.947
    -Not really.
    -I've created a monster.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.349
   Yeah, someone beat
   you to the punch on that.

07:32.920 --> 07:36.121
 I, uh, like what you guys have
 done with the place.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.290
      Hard to believe
      it's been this long.

07:38.292 --> 07:41.393
     Almost eight months
     since we sat across
     this table and talked.

07:41.395 --> 07:45.664
   Yeah, time flies when
   your life's a living hell.

07:45.666 --> 07:50.669
   I mean, you, the sparrows,
   the press... You guys
   did quite a number on me.

07:50.671 --> 07:52.070
 Hell, i can hardly wait to do

07:52.072 --> 07:53.972
     Whatever i can
     to help you guys out.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.274
     Is that how you really
     want to play this?

07:56.276 --> 07:58.510
 You ever think of
 changing the narrative, dylan?

08:00.180 --> 08:01.780
             What?

08:01.782 --> 08:03.982
   <i> Help us out, and we'll do</i>
   <i> what we can to get</i>

08:03.984 --> 08:05.584
        <i> Your picture in</i>
        <i> all the papers,</i>

08:05.586 --> 08:08.153
    But with a new headline.

08:08.155 --> 08:11.656
   "wrongly-accused boyfriend
   helps solve case."

08:11.658 --> 08:13.258
  Now, we know you flipped out
  at that party

08:13.260 --> 08:15.627
       When you found out
       emily was pregnant
         with your kid.

08:15.629 --> 08:18.129
  We know she left upset
  and was never seen again...

08:18.131 --> 08:19.698
        Until yesterday.

08:21.134 --> 08:23.068
       <i> Tell us something</i>
       <i> we don't know.</i>

08:26.306 --> 08:29.174
  Look, yes, okay. We fought.

08:29.176 --> 08:32.110
  I mean, that was one of the
  two things we were good at.

08:32.111 --> 08:34.712
     Em said that she was
     gonna hitchhike home.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.681
    (stammering) you know...
    When i calmed down
    i went after her,

08:36.683 --> 08:38.984
      But she'd already
      flagged down a ride.

08:38.986 --> 08:41.520
   It was a big black pickup
   with, like, a...
   I don't know...

08:41.522 --> 08:43.388
     A camper on the back.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.392
   And then i heard barking.

08:47.394 --> 08:50.862
   It was like a pack of dogs
   going crazy.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.297
            Barking?

08:52.900 --> 08:54.900
             Yeah.

08:54.902 --> 08:57.736
 I never mentioned the barking
 because it sounds dumb.

08:57.738 --> 09:00.372
  <i> And it makes no sense,</i>
  <i> and everyone already thought</i>
  <i> that i was lying, anyway.</i>

09:00.374 --> 09:03.708
 But when people starting
 saying that she was murdered,

09:03.710 --> 09:09.014
 I thought, "what if they were
 barking at, you know, blood?"

09:09.016 --> 09:12.317
       Like a fresh kill.

09:12.319 --> 09:16.221
     It would've been nice
     to know about this
     eight months ago.

09:16.223 --> 09:19.691
   Yeah, the "dingos
   ate my girlfriend" alibi,

09:19.693 --> 09:23.028
      That woulda changed
      everything, right?

09:23.030 --> 09:29.534
    But the "wrongly-accused
    boyfriend" thing...
    That, i like.

09:29.536 --> 09:31.570
  You know what's really gonna
  dial up the sympathy?

09:33.240 --> 09:35.340
      When i get the baby.

09:42.849 --> 09:46.518
 So that smug little punk just
 gets to walk away
 with emily's baby?

09:46.520 --> 09:48.119
      You need to cool it.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.855
 Not only did he not say
 anything to implicate himself,

09:50.857 --> 09:52.524
   He actually gave us a new
   piece of information.

09:52.526 --> 09:54.292
    About some yapping dogs.

09:54.294 --> 09:56.628
   I wouldn't be surprised if
   they barked because
   he kicked them.

09:56.630 --> 09:59.197
    -He's not really
    getting custody, is he?
    -He is the father.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.266
      He's the guy who
      got emily pregnant.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.701
     There's a difference.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.303
        (phone ringing)

10:11.612 --> 10:14.212
          -Babineaux.
          -It's major.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.147
     We need to talk about
     eddie and jerome.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.716
  There's more going on here.

10:17.718 --> 10:18.917
      I'm working with...

10:18.919 --> 10:20.919
    <i> Major, i hear you. I do.</i>

10:20.921 --> 10:22.988
  But with this emily sparrow
  case ongoing,
  my hands are tied.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.991
            <i> Clive...</i>

10:25.993 --> 10:27.826
  Look, no one
  from the homicide department
  or the mayor's office

10:27.828 --> 10:31.396
    Wants to see a bunch
    of names go up on the
    unsolved murders board.

10:32.599 --> 10:34.566
    Major? You still there?

10:34.568 --> 10:36.301
 Woman on phone:
 <i> Detective babineaux,</i>
 <i> are you saying the seattle pd</i>

10:36.303 --> 10:37.736
   <i> Serves their own interests</i>

10:37.738 --> 10:40.605
<i> Ahead of those of the citizens</i>
<i> they're meant to protect?</i>

10:40.607 --> 10:43.508
    I'm sorry, who is this?

10:43.510 --> 10:47.445
  I was about to say that i'm
  working with rebecca hinton
  from the <i> seattle observer.</i>

10:47.447 --> 10:49.147
       She's on the
       nine trolls story.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.248
      Detective babineaux?

10:51.618 --> 10:52.417
         (slams phone)

10:53.654 --> 10:54.719
          (dial tone)

10:55.956 --> 10:57.322
       Looks like if we
       want the candyman,

10:57.324 --> 10:58.990
       We'll have to find
       him ourselves.

11:03.697 --> 11:05.196
       I'm missing a rat.

11:06.466 --> 11:08.533
   Liv. You're rocking a rat.

11:08.535 --> 11:12.137
  I am five seconds away
  from naming it and then
  making it a grilled cheese.

11:12.139 --> 11:13.772
    These maternal instincts
    are relentless.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.674
      I was hoping to have
      these test subjects

11:15.676 --> 11:17.809
      Tagged and in their
      cages before your

11:17.811 --> 11:21.179
       Zombie gentleman
       caller arrives.
       Speaking of which,

11:21.181 --> 11:24.716
 I mentioned that
 i accidentally had to tell
 major about lowell, didn't i?

11:24.718 --> 11:26.851
   Must've slipped your mind.

11:26.853 --> 11:29.154
   It's fine.
   He probably would've
   found out sooner or later.

11:29.156 --> 11:30.722
         -Lowell: Liv?
         -Over here!

11:33.627 --> 11:35.260
  You remember my boss, ravi.

11:36.863 --> 11:39.164
    Sorry. I didn't realize

11:39.166 --> 11:41.332
 The bump-it, blow-it-up thing
 was over and we're
 back to just tapping rats.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.068
  It's just a bit of research.

11:43.070 --> 11:44.469
      People are often
      dismissive of rats,

11:44.471 --> 11:46.304
      But they are
      highly intelligent.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.039
   One of the only organisms,

11:48.041 --> 11:50.341
   Along with humans and some
   primates, to possess...

11:50.343 --> 11:53.378
      Metacognition, yeah.

11:53.380 --> 11:57.515
 Metacognition, it's like, um,
 your awareness of
 your ability to think.

11:57.517 --> 11:59.184
     Musicians have it too.

11:59.186 --> 12:02.754
   Anyway. Nice to meet you,
   and be aware of it.

12:02.756 --> 12:04.556
 Likewise. Are you from london?

12:04.558 --> 12:06.591
            -Camden.
            -Ah.

12:06.593 --> 12:09.094
     -Arsenal territory.
     I'm from upton park.
     -West ham boy, is it?

12:09.096 --> 12:10.662
       Well, i suppose
       it could be worse.

12:10.664 --> 12:12.363
 -You could support millwall.
 -You could support tottenham.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.132
          -Or chelsea.
          -Or chelsea.

12:16.570 --> 12:18.837
    Why do i have a
    sudden urge to
    dump tea into a harbor?

12:18.839 --> 12:20.739
   What's she talking about?

12:20.741 --> 12:24.075
    Colonist propaganda.
    Pay her no mind, we have
    zombie tests to conduct.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.243
           Shall we?

12:30.250 --> 12:32.517
   I assume you're employing
   koch's postulates
   in trying to determine

12:32.519 --> 12:34.185
    Whether we're dealing
    with a neurotropic virus

12:34.187 --> 12:35.920
     Or perhaps some kind
     of bacterial pathogen.

12:35.922 --> 12:38.223
      And what the hell
      am i talking about?

12:38.225 --> 12:40.859
       I thought you were
       a musician...

12:40.861 --> 12:43.595
   Apparently one with quite
   the keen scientific mind.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.030
        In his stomach.

12:46.032 --> 12:47.766
         Ah. Of course.

12:48.602 --> 12:51.269
          Cool. Mmm...

12:51.271 --> 12:53.872
    What is your hypothesis
    on the root cause
    of our condition?

12:53.874 --> 12:57.709
 Well, i'm testing a theory
 that its origin lies in a
 biochemical reaction catalyzed

12:57.711 --> 13:00.478
      By the combination
        of a bad batch
      of the drug utopium

13:00.480 --> 13:03.915
 And an ingredient,
 likely unlisted,
 in the max rager energy drink.

13:03.917 --> 13:06.117
    So you're using the rats
    to test the hypothesis.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.285
   My experiment will attempt

13:07.287 --> 13:09.721
    To pinpoint the
    aforementioned combination

13:09.723 --> 13:12.257
 Through the vaunted scientific
 tradition of trial and error.

13:12.259 --> 13:13.124
    Which one's the control?

13:16.329 --> 13:18.663
     Team alpha,
     water and sugar only.

13:18.665 --> 13:22.267
  Beta, 90 percent max rager,
  10 percent utopium.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.736
      Charlie, 20 percent.
      Delta, 30 percent.

13:24.738 --> 13:26.504
   Echo, 40 percent utopium.

13:27.841 --> 13:29.908
       Make good choices.

13:29.910 --> 13:30.975
     Godspeed to you, mate.

13:33.079 --> 13:34.979
      I should go
      back to the studio.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.081
      Well... I'll see you
      later tonight?

13:37.083 --> 13:38.216
  To watch a movie, remember?

13:41.822 --> 13:44.022
 Awesome sauce. See you later.

13:47.427 --> 13:50.128
       Awesome sauce
       and a buddy punch?

13:50.130 --> 13:52.664
    Is that my imagination,
    or did i just get
    friend-zoned?

13:54.334 --> 13:56.100
        Sorry was that
        not rhetorical?

13:56.102 --> 13:58.203
    The last time we kissed
    there were sparks.

13:58.205 --> 14:00.872
     Like, i thought i'd
     need a welder's helmet
     sparks and...

14:00.874 --> 14:03.374
  Did that seem sparky to you?

14:03.376 --> 14:05.877
      Oh, i should've been
      observing the kiss?
      Had i known...

14:05.879 --> 14:07.445
    Things were so
    great with us last week.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.781
        Like, buy new
        underwear great.

14:09.783 --> 14:11.349
      And now i just feel
      like a crazy person

14:11.351 --> 14:13.618
   Because what if that's
   not where we're at, right?

14:13.620 --> 14:15.553
    That was mixed signals.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.655
     Can we just talk about
     you being a zombie?

14:17.657 --> 14:22.393
  Brain-eating, being undead,
  these are things you can
  discuss at length with me.

14:22.395 --> 14:26.397
    But i can't give you the
    "girlfriend experience."

14:26.399 --> 14:28.299
    I don't think that means
    what you think it means.

14:30.237 --> 14:32.837
         What's wrong?

14:32.839 --> 14:37.342
 "detective clive babineaux
 confirmed the seattle police's
 misplaced priorities.

14:37.344 --> 14:40.178
     "'no one, from the
     homicide department to
     the mayor's office,

14:40.180 --> 14:42.881
 "'wants to see a bunch of
 names go up on
 the unsolved murders board.'"

14:42.883 --> 14:44.015
      Wow. It's accurate,

14:44.017 --> 14:46.251
      But i didn't think
      you'd go on record.

14:46.253 --> 14:49.320
 I didn't. Your ex screwed me.

14:49.322 --> 14:53.091
     I'm a pariah upstairs,
     and i've been demoted
     to paperwork detail.

14:54.527 --> 14:56.895
       Thanks for making
       the introduction.

15:10.777 --> 15:13.845
   Liv: <i> Emily's brain keeps</i>
  <i> pulling me back to the nicu.</i>

15:13.847 --> 15:16.347
  <i> I know he's not my baby,</i>
  <i> but it feels like he's mine.</i>

15:20.587 --> 15:22.086
<i> As much as they might wish it,</i>

15:22.088 --> 15:24.289
<i> He's not the sparrows' either.</i>

15:31.564 --> 15:34.399
    <i> What a pain in the ass,</i>
    <i> being a mom.</i>

15:34.401 --> 15:38.136
  <i> This much worrying,</i>
  <i> all for a child who probably</i>
  <i> won't appreciate it.</i>

15:42.375 --> 15:43.441
           Surprise!

15:45.145 --> 15:47.111
  Well, hello there, stranger!

15:49.816 --> 15:52.550
     -You look so handsome.
     -Thanks.

15:55.155 --> 15:59.624
   Oh. Okay.
   Nice to see you too. Mmm.

15:59.626 --> 16:02.160
  Wait, you're not looking for
  gas money, too, are you?

16:04.097 --> 16:05.496
   I need to get from a to b.

16:05.498 --> 16:08.333
    It's time for someone
    to get a part-time job.

16:08.335 --> 16:10.001
 Liv, can you please remind mom

16:10.003 --> 16:11.903
     That you never had
     a part-time job
     when you were my age?

16:11.905 --> 16:14.672
    Olivia, would you kindly
    inform your brother

16:14.674 --> 16:17.141
  That you also had a perfect
  4.0 gpa during

16:17.143 --> 16:19.110
  Your entire academic career.

16:19.112 --> 16:21.279
  You need to get from b to a.

16:21.281 --> 16:24.782
    Mom's right.
    A job might do you good.

16:24.784 --> 16:27.852
 Teach you some valuable
 lessons about responsibility.

16:27.854 --> 16:31.489
      You're on her side?
      Is this a bit?

16:31.491 --> 16:33.624
      When i was your age,
      we valued hard work.

16:33.626 --> 16:35.927
 Yeah, back in the hardscrabble
 year of '04.

16:35.929 --> 16:37.695
      All those cd-roms
      that needed burning.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.931
      We just want
      what's best for you.

16:44.371 --> 16:47.805
       Fine. You win.
       What else is new?

16:47.807 --> 16:51.142
  I picked up applications
  from a few places
  in the neighborhood

16:51.144 --> 16:52.710
   That are hiring teenagers.

16:52.712 --> 16:55.013
     When you deliver them,
     would you at least
     wear a shirt

16:55.015 --> 16:57.715
     That has seen an iron?

16:57.717 --> 17:00.685
    -Honestly, ev.
    -Okay, are there hidden
    cameras here somewhere?

17:07.227 --> 17:10.728
   More property deeds.
   Suzuki wants you to expand
   the search radius

17:10.730 --> 17:14.799
  -From five miles to 10.
  -There's no way emily walked
  10 miles on that ankle.

17:14.800 --> 17:17.902
   I guess it's just more
   misplaced priorities
   at the police department.

17:17.904 --> 17:19.704
 You've got your
 reporter friend on speed dial.

17:19.705 --> 17:22.440
   -You should let her know.
   -I didn't know there was
   a reporter on that call.

17:26.413 --> 17:27.478
            My bad.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.866
   I followed the paper
   trail back to the source.

17:48.868 --> 17:51.169
     Sparrow's song is a
     corporate tax shelter

17:51.171 --> 17:54.505
  The family set up years ago.
  The cottage was purchased
  by the corporation.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.941
      Still, someone
      should've found it.

17:56.943 --> 18:00.144
 -If emily was here all along,
 the press'll have a field day.
 -"no comment."

18:01.714 --> 18:03.748
        Just practicing.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.217
   My lieutenant is making me
   write it a hundred times
   on the chalk board,

18:06.219 --> 18:07.852
       Like bart simpson.

18:07.854 --> 18:09.620
   I know that you're upset
   but major would never have

18:09.622 --> 18:11.122
     Sold you out
     to her intentionally.

18:11.124 --> 18:14.058
    Yeah, maybe.
    You'd be surprised what
    people are capable of

18:14.060 --> 18:15.793
      When they're at the
      end of their rope.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.203
  Take a look inside.
  See if it triggers anything.

18:28.875 --> 18:32.543
   That's where i saw emily
   fighting with her parents
         in my vision.

18:32.545 --> 18:35.246
    I'm not getting anything
    more from out here.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.849
     We can't go inside
     without an invitation
     or probable cause.

18:38.651 --> 18:39.984
           (clanging)

18:42.789 --> 18:46.424
        Does that count?

18:46.426 --> 18:48.593
  Clive: We'll tell
  internal affairs it sounded
  like a woman screaming.

18:48.595 --> 18:49.961
      (clanging continues)

18:52.899 --> 18:55.733
  Ah, it's just a water tank.

18:55.735 --> 18:56.801
   We're already down here...

19:03.176 --> 19:05.076
 They didn't get this at ikea.

19:05.078 --> 19:07.111
 No. This is what
 rumpelstiltskin carves for you

19:07.113 --> 19:08.980
     After you promise him
     your firstborn.

19:08.982 --> 19:10.615
      Clive: And it didn't
      get made last week.

19:10.617 --> 19:14.252
      -This took months.
      -Like, eight months?

19:14.254 --> 19:16.554
         (dogs barking)

19:19.759 --> 19:20.558
          (door shuts)

19:31.371 --> 19:33.037
        -(dogs barking)
        -(shushing)

19:39.212 --> 19:40.611
         (dog howling)

19:41.347 --> 19:42.680
         (emily crying)

19:46.186 --> 19:47.685
      (cell phone ringing)

19:49.489 --> 19:52.723
   -Babineaux.
   -Detective. James sparrow.

19:52.725 --> 19:56.227
 Listen, someone broke
 into my storm cellar and
 i've got 'em trapped in here.

19:56.229 --> 19:59.130
       Yeah, about that.
       Funny story...

20:01.901 --> 20:04.235
     That's quite a crib
     you've got down there.

20:04.237 --> 20:05.703
   Talk about craftsmanship.

20:09.342 --> 20:11.142
       Why are you here?

20:11.144 --> 20:13.711
  My lieutenant asked me to
  investigate property records

20:13.713 --> 20:16.247
    Within 10 miles of where
    emily was discovered.

20:16.249 --> 20:20.851
  I came across this cabin
  owned by sparrow song, inc.

20:20.853 --> 20:23.354
  I wouldn't be doing my job
  if i didn't come down here.

20:23.356 --> 20:25.089
      You can look around
      all you want.

20:25.091 --> 20:26.557
    Go ahead,
    we got nothing to hide.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.126
    Clive: About the crib...

20:29.896 --> 20:31.362
    You were handcarving it

20:31.364 --> 20:34.532
  Like you knew there would be
  a baby here at some point.

20:34.534 --> 20:37.201
  I started a couple of weeks
  after emily went missing.

20:37.203 --> 20:39.737
 Call it denial. Call it hope.
 It was...

20:39.739 --> 20:43.007
    It was pointless anyway,
    building a crib.

20:43.009 --> 20:45.743
      Dylan's never gonna
      give up custody.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.211
  He won't even let us visit.

20:47.213 --> 20:50.114
   We're never even gonna get
   to hold our grandson.

20:50.116 --> 20:52.016
   There was
   a doorframe like this
   in the house i grew up in.

20:53.853 --> 20:56.287
    Every parent thinks
    their child is special,

20:56.289 --> 20:58.055
      But she really was.

20:58.057 --> 21:02.126
     She was smart, funny,
     caring, respectful...

21:02.128 --> 21:06.197
   She was a total tomboy
   until she was 15? Sixteen?

21:06.199 --> 21:07.932
    And then she met dylan.

21:07.934 --> 21:11.269
   She started skipping
   out of school,
   partying, booze, drugs...

21:12.905 --> 21:16.307
   We didn't react very well.

21:16.309 --> 21:20.511
   We had another life, once.
   And i don't even
   remember it anymore.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.650
   I got a clear "we did not
   kidnap our own kid"
   vibe from them,

21:25.652 --> 21:27.551
   But let's just say
   they showed up to retrieve
   emily from the party

21:27.553 --> 21:29.453
  The night she went missing.

21:29.455 --> 21:31.289
     Those dogs of theirs
         might've been
     the ones dylan heard.

21:31.291 --> 21:34.425
  Clive, wait. I had a vision,
  but not about the sparrows.

21:34.427 --> 21:36.327
     Emily was locked up in
     the back of a truck.

21:36.329 --> 21:38.229
     She was surrounded
     by barking dogs,
     just like dylan said,

21:38.231 --> 21:41.132
     But i think it was an
     animal control truck.

21:41.134 --> 21:43.267
 Well, seen from a distance,
 that would fit his description

21:43.269 --> 21:45.469
   Of a truck with a camper.

21:45.471 --> 21:48.005
   I saw a man,
   the driver, i think,
   but it was from the back.

21:48.007 --> 21:50.508
       I couldn't see
       much of his face.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.643
     (sighs) well,
     i have to get back to
     paperwork mountain,

21:52.645 --> 21:54.478
  But maybe i can have
  someone from animal control

21:54.480 --> 21:56.280
        Bring me their
        personnel files.

21:56.282 --> 21:58.115
      They should include
      their id photos.

21:58.117 --> 22:01.285
   Let's hope their id photos
   were shot from
   behind their right ear.

22:01.287 --> 22:04.388
     At night, illuminated
     by the glowing embers
        of a cigarette.

22:05.992 --> 22:08.392
  Oh! Oh!
  You scared me half to death!

22:09.762 --> 22:11.629
              Oh.

22:11.631 --> 22:15.266
  Aw, look at you two!
  Detectives ebony and ivory.

22:16.135 --> 22:17.702
    I'm detective babineaux,

22:17.704 --> 22:21.005
 And this is olivia moore from
 the medical examiner's office.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.674
 You're an, uh,
 animal control officer, ms...

22:23.676 --> 22:25.776
       Littlefield.
       Margo littlefield.

22:25.778 --> 22:29.347
       -Are these the
       employee records?
       -Oh, yeah.

22:29.349 --> 22:32.316
  We heard this was in regards
  to the emily sparrow case.

22:32.318 --> 22:34.318
         Is that true?

22:34.320 --> 22:36.053
     Is one of our officers
     a suspect?

22:36.055 --> 22:38.823
      Well, we're just
      covering our bases.

22:38.825 --> 22:40.891
   Do drivers take the trucks
   home after shifts?

22:40.893 --> 22:43.994
      Hmm? Oh, yeah, yeah.
      It's more efficient.

22:43.996 --> 22:47.531
   Well, you never know when
   you might get a call
   in your own backyard.

22:47.533 --> 22:50.835
  Any of those pics match our
  eyewitness' description?

22:50.837 --> 22:52.570
    Nope, but remember
    "she" only got a slight

22:52.572 --> 22:54.004
    Profile view of the man.

22:54.006 --> 22:57.575
      You guys have
      an eyewitness? Whoa.

22:57.577 --> 23:00.578
   Anyone leave or get fired
   in the last eight months?

23:00.580 --> 23:02.646
  Uh... Oh, you don't mean...

23:04.751 --> 23:07.084
    (chuckling)
    i really shouldn't say.

23:07.086 --> 23:09.720
        Afraid i'm gonna
        have to insist.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.856
  Well, we... (clears throat)

23:11.858 --> 23:15.025
   We did have to
   let one officer go for...

23:15.027 --> 23:18.662
 Well, let's just say he
 took advantage of the uniform
 to look in ladies' windows.

23:19.365 --> 23:21.499
         A peeping tom.

23:21.501 --> 23:25.903
       Or in this case,
       a peeping gerald.
       Ugh. Gerald denny.

23:31.344 --> 23:34.378
 If that's your
 "i just solved the case" look,
 it needs work.

23:34.380 --> 23:37.281
 Gerald denny got busted
 for trespassing and voyeurism.

23:37.283 --> 23:39.917
    He's been in prison for
    the past four months.

23:39.919 --> 23:42.620
  So unless he's been keeping
  emily captive in his cell,

23:42.622 --> 23:44.021
      That leaves us back
      at square one.

23:45.691 --> 23:47.224
 (sighs)
 looks like another all-nighter

23:47.226 --> 23:50.127
      Staring at property
      deeds for me.

23:50.129 --> 23:53.764
     You'll ruin your eyes.
     I'd like to talk to
     your lieutenant,

23:53.766 --> 23:55.699
  Give him a piece of my mind.

23:55.701 --> 23:58.536
    (stammering)
    um, yeah, don't do that.

23:58.538 --> 24:01.105
   Go on, get on out of here.

24:01.107 --> 24:02.840
   I'm sure there are places
   you'd rather be.

24:05.077 --> 24:06.777
   Lowell: What a difference
   a few months makes, right?

24:06.779 --> 24:08.546
   I saw that in the theater
   and i was like,
   "whoo!

24:08.548 --> 24:10.981
   "you go, woody harrelson.
   Mow down those zombies."

24:10.983 --> 24:12.483
       -It was hilarious.
       -Mmm-hmm.

24:12.485 --> 24:15.419
    Now, on second viewing,
    it's like watching
    <i> sophie's choice.</i>

24:15.421 --> 24:18.389
 I mean,
 who cares about your twinkies,
 tallahassee?

24:18.391 --> 24:20.157
   That zombie's probably...

24:24.297 --> 24:25.629
            Oh, god.

24:25.631 --> 24:28.833
   Sorry. Uh, i don't know...

24:28.835 --> 24:29.867
       (shudders) ugh...

24:31.103 --> 24:33.237
        Ugh? Seriously?

24:33.239 --> 24:37.408
 I'm sorry,
 i've never had anything close
 to an "ugh" in my life.

24:37.410 --> 24:40.311
    I once had a guy try to
    make out with me after
    i puked up garlic bread.

24:40.313 --> 24:43.781
        It's not that,
        it's just, um...

24:43.783 --> 24:45.749
   All right liv,
   i didn't wanna have to
   tell you like this, but...

24:47.687 --> 24:50.688
            I'm gay.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.656
      But not to worry,
      it's only until
      i eat my next brain.

24:53.326 --> 24:55.159
         Oh, thank god.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.495
 Yeah, i knew something was up
 but i didn't really get it

24:57.497 --> 24:59.930
 Until i saw a magazine
 with idris elba on the cover,

24:59.932 --> 25:03.634
      And the phrase
      "big piece of yum"
      popped into my head.

25:03.636 --> 25:05.669
 I'm mildly afraid of heights,

25:05.671 --> 25:07.338
  But i would not hesitate to
  climb that mountain.

25:07.340 --> 25:10.140
  I feel you. So, we're good?

25:10.142 --> 25:14.144
  We're great.
  My plan is to score some
  ludicrously straight brain.

25:14.146 --> 25:17.481
      -Asap. I may dig up
      wilt chamberlain.
      -So, now what?

25:17.483 --> 25:21.018
     We get drunk and play
     do, dump, or date,
     boy band edition?

25:21.020 --> 25:23.287
      Do harry. Dump zayn.
      Date liam.

25:23.289 --> 25:24.989
  Sorry, should i have had to
  think longer about that?

25:24.991 --> 25:27.358
      You skipped the
      getting drunk part.

25:28.494 --> 25:30.194
      (rock music playing)

25:42.008 --> 25:42.873
       Oh, come on!
       It's not that bad.

25:45.077 --> 25:45.910
             Stop.

26:04.664 --> 26:06.163
   (indistinct conversation)

26:35.461 --> 26:36.293
         (baby crying)

26:42.268 --> 26:44.301
     Liv: <i> No matter</i>
     <i> what future you can</i>
     <i> imagine for yourself,</i>

26:44.303 --> 26:47.471
  <i> It won't include motherhood.</i>

26:47.473 --> 26:50.374
   <i> And when dylan munson</i>
   <i> comes to collect his son,</i>

26:50.376 --> 26:52.142
        <i> It's gonna rip</i>
        <i> your heart out.</i>

26:56.983 --> 26:59.049
         (baby crying)

27:00.219 --> 27:01.485
          Nurse: Shh.

27:03.889 --> 27:05.022
              Shh.

27:09.595 --> 27:11.595
   -Shh!
   -(whispering) you're going
   to kill yourself!

27:11.597 --> 27:14.531
   She's going to catch you!
   Don't go! She'll kill you.

27:21.240 --> 27:23.474
  And then i fell.
  But they said,
  "she's going to catch you."

27:23.476 --> 27:24.775
      I saw a man earlier,

27:24.777 --> 27:27.277
    But we should be looking
    for a woman. A couple.

27:27.279 --> 27:28.812
     I found something too.

27:28.814 --> 27:31.181
 Now, we know emily couldn't
 have walked far on that ankle,

27:31.183 --> 27:32.750
     But what if
     she had been carried?

27:32.752 --> 27:34.251
   As in,
   by the current of a river?

27:35.955 --> 27:38.689
   Say she was trying to get
   to her family's cottage.

27:38.691 --> 27:42.426
  I traced a rough trajectory.
  It crosses this river.

27:42.428 --> 27:44.495
      What if we have the
      wrong search radius?

27:44.497 --> 27:48.832
     So i checked
     properties upriver...

27:48.834 --> 27:52.703
    One belongs to this man.
    Mark shepherd.

27:52.705 --> 27:55.272
       Served 90 days
       a few years back.
       Weapon charges.

27:55.274 --> 27:57.875
    Could be the man i saw.
    It's still hard to say.

27:57.877 --> 27:59.309
      Is he a dog-catcher?

27:59.311 --> 28:02.346
      No. But guess
      who he's married to.

28:23.235 --> 28:24.635
      (cell phone ringing)

28:26.405 --> 28:27.705
        What'd you get?

28:27.707 --> 28:29.173
       My cop buddy says
       candyman's plates

28:29.175 --> 28:30.774
      Are registered to
      a shell corporation.

28:31.677 --> 28:33.544
      Of course they are.

28:33.546 --> 28:36.313
    Look, i tailed him from
    the skate park.

28:36.315 --> 28:40.050
  And now he's at a
  tanning salon in shoreline.

28:40.052 --> 28:41.719
       I can't do much
       without his name.

28:43.889 --> 28:45.122
    I'm gonna call you back.

29:20.192 --> 29:21.759
         Julien dupont.

29:37.810 --> 29:39.543
        -Oh!
        -(siren sounds)

29:49.622 --> 29:51.922
         Look, officer,
         i can explain.

29:51.924 --> 29:52.856
   Put the weapon down, sir.

29:55.661 --> 29:58.395
  The guy who owns this car
  is a drug dealer, all right?

29:58.397 --> 30:00.631
    He passes out
    utopium to kids at
    nine trolls skate park.

30:00.633 --> 30:02.599
    Argh! Those kids
    have been going missing.

30:02.601 --> 30:05.068
      -(grunts)
      -you have the right
      to remain silent.

30:05.070 --> 30:08.238
        Hey, that's him!
        Julien dupont,
        the candyman.

30:08.240 --> 30:11.942
 He's got a human brain
 in that ice chest right there!

30:11.944 --> 30:13.744
  -Officer, this is my car...
  -Stay back.

30:15.114 --> 30:16.413
     Keep your hands
     where we can see them.

30:36.268 --> 30:37.401
         What is this?

30:41.307 --> 30:44.141
     Calf brain.
     There are some people,

30:44.143 --> 30:47.277
  Believe it or not,
  who consider it a delicacy.

30:47.279 --> 30:51.215
   I work at a fancy-schmancy
   butcher shop.
   Well... We deliver.

30:54.854 --> 30:56.753
     I've got a card. Okay?

31:08.868 --> 31:11.068
  Have your insurance contact
  the precinct for a report.

31:11.070 --> 31:13.470
  What? You're letting him go?

31:13.472 --> 31:15.706
       As i was saying,
       you have the right
       to remain silent.

31:15.708 --> 31:18.408
  Probably now is a good time
  to exercise it.

31:18.410 --> 31:19.243
             No...

31:34.493 --> 31:36.894
  The fine art of a stakeout.

31:36.896 --> 31:39.029
     Stakeouts are an
     exercise in patience.

31:39.031 --> 31:41.331
    You need to be focused,
    yet calm.

31:41.333 --> 31:44.167
  It's a skill like any other.
  Takes time to master.

31:47.206 --> 31:49.439
     There's the
     animal control truck.

31:49.441 --> 31:51.842
    First time i was on a
    stakeout, i was so bored

31:51.844 --> 31:54.878
     I ate three candy bars
     and an entire package
     of mini donuts.

31:54.880 --> 31:58.348
     Fyi, if you're waiting
     to bust a coke den,

31:58.350 --> 32:00.784
  It's better if you're not
  riding a sugar high
  and covered in white powder.

32:00.786 --> 32:02.519
  The windows aren't the same
  as in my vision.

32:02.521 --> 32:04.621
    This isn't where they're
    keeping the girls.

32:04.623 --> 32:07.557
  Maybe they installed
  new windows after
  emily broke out. Or maybe...

32:07.559 --> 32:09.192
   The windows are different
   around back.

32:09.194 --> 32:11.962
   Those other girls, clive,
   they were petrified.

32:11.964 --> 32:13.597
     Who knows how
     the shepherds reacted
     after emily escaped.

32:13.599 --> 32:15.699
      They might've taken
      it out on them.

32:15.701 --> 32:18.035
      Let's sneak up.
      Peek in the windows.

32:18.037 --> 32:21.271
   What did i say? Patience.
   We've been here
   all of two minutes.

32:21.273 --> 32:23.106
       We're in this
       for the long haul.

32:23.108 --> 32:24.908
        Get comfortable,
        it's gonna be...

32:24.910 --> 32:26.343
           -(gunshot)
           -get down!

32:28.714 --> 32:29.947
           (gunshots)

32:31.617 --> 32:34.885
  Officer needs assistance,
  shots fired, 255 lear road!

32:34.887 --> 32:36.586
      I need backup, now!

32:36.588 --> 32:38.355
           Stay down!

32:50.336 --> 32:51.601
       We'll approach
       through the woods.

32:51.603 --> 32:54.271
    When we reach the house,
    i'll enter first, alone.

32:54.273 --> 32:55.772
          Do not enter

32:55.774 --> 32:57.674
    Until you get my signal.

32:57.676 --> 32:58.875
          Let's roll.

33:02.414 --> 33:05.182
    -So you're out of range,
    hang tight.
    -The other girls, clive.

33:05.184 --> 33:08.685
        -We'll find 'em.
        -Be careful.

33:08.687 --> 33:11.421
    Don't worry.
    I do this for a living.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.177
         There you are.

34:10.748 --> 34:13.150
      All right. Remember,
      wait for my signal.

34:13.152 --> 34:14.317
             Copy.

34:33.705 --> 34:35.005
        (margo screams)

35:05.270 --> 35:06.870
       (distant gunfire)

35:15.647 --> 35:17.047
         (liv screams)

35:23.755 --> 35:24.821
           (growling)

35:32.297 --> 35:34.131
  Hands up, behind your head.

35:34.133 --> 35:36.233
     (gasping) oh... Okay.

35:39.738 --> 35:41.404
             Okay.

35:41.406 --> 35:42.706
      Look, it was his...

36:15.941 --> 36:18.375
   I'm with the police.
   We're here to rescue you.

36:21.213 --> 36:24.181
     -Lieutenant, you okay?
     -I'm fine.

36:26.718 --> 36:28.018
        Where were you?

36:28.020 --> 36:30.720
       I gave the signal
       five minutes ago.

36:30.722 --> 36:32.622
     Doesn't matter.
     Situation's resolved.

36:47.172 --> 36:49.239
   It's okay. More good guys.

36:49.241 --> 36:50.540
     Where'd you find them?

36:50.542 --> 36:51.708
  In the treehouse, out back.

36:53.512 --> 36:55.378
 Lieutenant goes full eastwood,

36:55.380 --> 36:57.347
      The medical examiner
      saves the girls...

36:57.349 --> 36:58.715
       Why'd i even come
       to work today?

37:01.053 --> 37:02.919
            You hit?

37:04.890 --> 37:08.391
  No, just jabbed by a branch.

37:08.393 --> 37:10.393
     Yeah, not much blood.

37:17.269 --> 37:21.338
    All right. Let's lock it
    down for evidence.
    The whole property.

37:21.340 --> 37:23.006
   Let's see what else
   the shepherds were up to.

37:23.008 --> 37:24.074
           Yes, sir.

37:29.281 --> 37:32.215
  The resolution of this case
  would not have been possible

37:32.217 --> 37:35.518
  Without the invaluable
  assistance of dylan munson.

37:36.922 --> 37:40.090
    Margo and mark shepherd
    were highly disturbed.

37:40.092 --> 37:43.393
    From evidence found
    at their home
    over the last 24 hours,

37:43.395 --> 37:48.598
   We know that they adhered
   to a self-created religion
   of sorts.

37:48.600 --> 37:52.269
  The girls were abducted with
  the intent to turn them
  into sister-wives.

37:52.271 --> 37:55.272
    The remains of at least
    a dozen teenagers
    listed as missing

37:55.274 --> 37:56.873
        Were discovered
        on the property.

37:56.875 --> 37:59.776
   Their beliefs also called
   for human sacrifice.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.278
     (reporters clamoring)

38:03.315 --> 38:05.415
     One at a time, please.

38:05.417 --> 38:08.652
    They're still excavating
    remains of missing kids
    out there.

38:08.654 --> 38:10.920
   You heard jerome and eddie
   were among them?

38:10.922 --> 38:12.489
  I can't get a hold of major.

38:12.491 --> 38:14.491
 If he finds out on the news...

38:14.493 --> 38:16.726
      Look, emily's escape
      may have saved
      countless more lives

38:16.728 --> 38:18.461
      From the same fate,
      not just her baby's.

38:20.165 --> 38:22.565
   A cop who keeps his word.

38:22.567 --> 38:26.770
 That's one of the seven signs
 of the apocalypse, isn't it?

38:26.772 --> 38:29.406
 Well, i hope everyone finally
 gets to see you
 for who you really are.

38:29.408 --> 38:33.476
      Don't worry about my
      story getting out.
      See, i got an agent.

38:33.478 --> 38:36.212
      We're negotiating
      a reality show
      for me and the kid.

38:37.482 --> 38:39.115
    "grieving single father

38:39.117 --> 38:41.618
      "pieces his life
      back together after

38:41.620 --> 38:44.654
     "the cops, the press,
     and the grandparents
     tried to destroy it."

38:45.924 --> 38:47.691
       That's the pitch.

38:47.693 --> 38:50.760
     And the best part is
     how much it's gonna
     piss off the sparrows.

38:56.535 --> 38:59.502
     -Who the hell are you?
     -Have you even been
     to visit your son yet?

38:59.504 --> 39:03.640
    Look, beetlejuice,
    i don't remember saying
    your name three times,

39:03.642 --> 39:05.275
      So stay the hell
      out of my business.

39:05.277 --> 39:07.644
  When you get your baby home
  and put him in the crib,

39:07.646 --> 39:10.814
    Will you lay him face up
    or face down?

39:10.816 --> 39:13.383
   Because one way carries
   the risk that your son
   will die during the night.

39:13.385 --> 39:15.652
     Do you know which one?

39:15.654 --> 39:19.589
  I'm sure your reality show's
  sids episode
  will have killer ratings.

39:28.233 --> 39:30.333
          Damn, girl.

39:30.335 --> 39:31.901
      Get on back
      with your bad self.

39:36.174 --> 39:38.708
     Liv: <i> Emily's</i>
     <i> maternal instincts</i>
     <i> are starting to fade,</i>

39:38.710 --> 39:40.810
  <i> But i need to see her baby.</i>

39:40.812 --> 39:44.180
    <i> Our baby. One more time.</i>

39:44.182 --> 39:47.751
     <i> I might never see him</i>
     <i> or feel a bond</i>
     <i> quite like this again.</i>

40:09.408 --> 40:10.907
           You happy?

40:14.913 --> 40:17.747
   Liv: <i> There's only one man</i>
   <i> i've ever pictured myself</i>
       <i> having kids with.</i>

40:24.356 --> 40:27.390
   <i> But even if ravi can find</i>
   <i> a cure for "zombied,"</i>

40:27.392 --> 40:31.194
  <i> I've pushed him so far away,</i>
  <i> i doubt we can ever recover.</i>

40:31.196 --> 40:34.664
 Guard: A little thank you for
 the <i> seattle observer</i> article,
          lilywhite.

40:47.446 --> 40:49.612
      Liv: <i> I can't get back</i>
     <i> what i've lost,</i>

40:49.614 --> 40:51.915
       <i> But i still have</i>
       <i> reasons to go on.</i>

40:51.917 --> 40:53.550
        <i> Like my family.</i>

40:53.552 --> 40:56.886
    Take it easy on the
    wasabi, dear. You don't
    want to get heartburn.

40:56.888 --> 40:58.421
   Liv: <i> I've always loved them,</i>
  <i> of course,</i>

40:58.423 --> 41:01.791
   <i> But emily's brain</i>
   <i> gave me a new perspective.</i>

41:01.793 --> 41:04.227
    <i> It helped me appreciate</i>
    <i> my mother more,</i>

41:04.229 --> 41:06.663
  <i> Made me want to be</i>
  <i> a better big sister to evan.</i>

41:09.267 --> 41:11.835
  <i> Reminded me to appreciate</i>
  <i> the love that comes my way.</i>

41:13.672 --> 41:15.371
    <i> Familial and otherwise.</i>

41:16.508 --> 41:17.874
<i> Hopefully fate allows me that.</i>

41:19.244 --> 41:21.911
       <i> Please, fate.</i>
       <i> No more surprises.</i>
