WEBVTT

00:04.917 --> 00:07.964
WOMAN: Moving on, let's review
the stats for 2018.

00:08.008 --> 00:10.923
The metrics from December
are now available.

00:10.967 --> 00:14.753
Looking back over the year,
we've loaded 48 ships

00:14.797 --> 00:17.669
with 3,200 tons of ammunition.

00:17.713 --> 00:19.758
That's up nine percent
from 2017.

00:19.802 --> 00:22.805
Along with a 15% reduction
in workplace injuries.

00:22.848 --> 00:23.849
Not too shabby.

00:23.893 --> 00:25.677
Keep doing what you're doing.

00:25.721 --> 00:28.071
Next, we have
an update

00:28.115 --> 00:30.987
on the pier replacement proposal

00:31.031 --> 00:33.207
and its, uh...

00:33.250 --> 00:34.382
What's that?

00:37.124 --> 00:38.908
What is what, ma'am?

00:42.129 --> 00:43.521
Nothing.

00:45.175 --> 00:47.003
Sorry.

00:48.613 --> 00:51.094
Back to the proposal.

00:53.183 --> 00:54.750
The...

00:56.056 --> 00:58.319
the pier...MAN: Is she okay?

00:58.362 --> 01:00.103
...propo... propo...What's happening?

01:05.108 --> 01:07.023
Ma'am, can you
hear me? Ma'am.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.851
Get some pressure
on the bleeding.

01:08.894 --> 01:10.374
I'm calling 911.

01:34.746 --> 01:37.097
How's this possible?
How is every hotel room

01:37.140 --> 01:39.142
in Kauai booked?

01:39.186 --> 01:41.492
Oh, I just found a suite
in Maui.Oh.

01:41.536 --> 01:44.016
For $4,000 a night.

01:44.060 --> 01:45.888
Wow, that's fantastic,
as long as it's

01:45.931 --> 01:46.758
buy one night,
get 12 nights free.

01:46.802 --> 01:48.151
Morning.Good morning.

01:48.195 --> 01:49.761
Hey.Change tactics.

01:49.805 --> 01:52.373
You check out Tahiti,
I'm gonna check out Fiji.Okay.

01:52.416 --> 01:53.896
So, uh, is this a case,

01:53.939 --> 01:55.506
or are we tracking down
rum smugglers?

01:55.550 --> 01:57.639
No, we're trying to plan
our honeymoon.

01:57.682 --> 01:59.380
Ah.It's getting
kind of late, right?

01:59.423 --> 02:00.859
It's two
months away.

02:00.903 --> 02:02.861
Yeah, but isn't March

02:02.905 --> 02:04.863
the month when everyone
goes on spring break?

02:04.907 --> 02:06.691
Families, college kids.

02:06.735 --> 02:09.477
Super helpful. That's what
that is. Just super...

02:09.520 --> 02:10.913
helpful.You know what,

02:10.956 --> 02:12.523
why don't we
ditch our beach idea altogether.

02:12.567 --> 02:14.134
Let's go to Italy.

02:14.177 --> 02:15.222
We'll do, like,
a gastronomy trip.

02:15.265 --> 02:16.658
There's culture,
there's history.

02:16.701 --> 02:17.920
What? No.

02:17.963 --> 02:19.487
That's what people do
when they retire.

02:19.530 --> 02:20.618
Baby, I want to do
something active.

02:20.662 --> 02:22.098
You want to surf.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.752
Maybe.You know, they say marriage

02:23.795 --> 02:25.406
is about compromise.

02:25.449 --> 02:26.494
Sam, help us out--

02:26.537 --> 02:27.669
where's your dream vacation?

02:27.712 --> 02:28.713
Hit me.

02:28.757 --> 02:30.454
I want to take the kids
to Egypt.

02:30.498 --> 02:31.847
That's what I'm talking about.
They get to learn about

02:31.890 --> 02:33.065
the pyramids, about the Sphinx,

02:33.109 --> 02:34.545
about the cradle
of civilization.

02:34.589 --> 02:35.546
SAM:
Actually, we're gonna

02:35.590 --> 02:36.678
keep it active.
We're gonna

02:36.721 --> 02:38.114
go scuba diving in the Red Sea.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.116
Ha! See, that's what
I'mtalking about.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.683
You know why
he's doing that?

02:41.726 --> 02:42.988
He's not 107.

02:43.032 --> 02:45.687
Callen, what's your
dream vacation?

02:45.730 --> 02:47.732
I don't know.I think you're asking
the wrong guy.

02:47.776 --> 02:49.734
He has 44 days of
unused vacation time.

02:50.779 --> 02:51.736
What?!

02:51.780 --> 02:53.216
What do you want me to tell you?

02:53.260 --> 02:55.653
I happen to like my job.Mm.

02:55.697 --> 02:57.220
Callen, everybody needs
some time off.

02:57.264 --> 02:59.614
I took a couple three-day
weekends last year.

02:59.657 --> 03:00.745
DEEKS: Three...
Buddy, that makes me sad,

03:00.789 --> 03:03.313
in my heart, for you.
You want to know

03:03.357 --> 03:04.662
where the happiest people
on the planet are?

03:04.706 --> 03:06.273
Where?Denmark.

03:06.316 --> 03:07.665
And you want
to know why?

03:07.709 --> 03:09.537
Why?Because they have
the shortest workdays

03:09.580 --> 03:11.103
and they have five weeks
paid vacation.

03:11.147 --> 03:13.149
I would love to go to Denmark.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.542
T-That's not why I...
I don't want to go

03:14.585 --> 03:16.152
to Denmark. That's not
why I brought it up.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.894
Wait, guys, have you
considered Iceland?

03:18.937 --> 03:20.765
Okay, activity-wise,

03:20.809 --> 03:23.681
you could hike a glacier.
Or paddle a fjord.

03:23.725 --> 03:25.117
And, culturally,

03:25.161 --> 03:27.772
there are these incredible
Viking museums.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.559
All righty, then.

03:31.602 --> 03:34.039
We have a case.

03:34.083 --> 03:35.563
There we are.

03:35.606 --> 03:38.000
Reykjavik average
temperature in March--

03:38.043 --> 03:39.784
ooh, it's a balmy 28 degrees.

03:39.828 --> 03:42.483
I hear the ice hotels
are very romantic.

03:45.312 --> 03:47.966
This is Commander Valerie
Torres, head of logistics

03:48.010 --> 03:50.099
at Naval Weapons Station
Seal Beach.

03:50.142 --> 03:51.492
Ouch.Yeah, she didn't quite

03:51.535 --> 03:53.233
make it through her
staff meeting this morning.

03:53.276 --> 03:55.626
That looks like more
than a bump on the head.

03:55.670 --> 03:58.629
Uh, major concussion. Still
hospitalized and unconscious.

03:58.673 --> 04:00.501
That sounds like
a medical case.

04:00.544 --> 04:02.024
Except,
over the past week,

04:02.067 --> 04:04.287
she's been concerned
someone's trying to kill her.

04:04.331 --> 04:05.897
Someone in particular?

04:05.941 --> 04:07.290
Uh, it's all pretty vague.

04:07.334 --> 04:09.727
She's requested security
escorts to and from her car.

04:09.771 --> 04:11.599
Could be related
to a personnel issue.

04:11.642 --> 04:12.774
Or it could be related to all

04:12.817 --> 04:13.949
the weapons
for the Pacific fleet.

04:13.992 --> 04:15.516
SAM:
She's in charge of 500,000

04:15.559 --> 04:17.735
square feet of
ammunition storage.

04:17.779 --> 04:20.695
Including Tomahawks for our
guided missile destroyers.

04:20.738 --> 04:22.653
Yeah, you disrupt command,
you disrupt operations.

04:22.697 --> 04:25.221
And you could use the diversion
to steal from the weapons cache.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.310
Which is why
we got the Bat-Signal.

04:27.354 --> 04:30.487
Well, the good news is it's
no longer rush hour on the 405.

04:30.531 --> 04:32.359
DEEKS:
Well, the good news is also

04:32.402 --> 04:34.361
that, at low tide,
the weapons station jetty's

04:34.404 --> 04:36.711
got this killer left break.
I could go surf.

04:37.755 --> 04:39.235
Sam and I will
take Seal Beach.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.671
Oh!Why don't you and Kensi

04:40.715 --> 04:41.803
go down to see Torres
in the hospital?

04:41.846 --> 04:43.021
ERIC:
Which is in

04:43.065 --> 04:44.196
Los Alamitos.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.807
Just a mere six miles
from the beach.

04:45.850 --> 04:47.287
KENSI:
Yeah, someone's got to be there

04:47.330 --> 04:49.811
when she wakes up.Which could be tomorrow.

04:49.854 --> 04:50.899
Then you wait.

04:50.942 --> 04:53.031
Like you do
for the perfect wave.

04:53.075 --> 04:55.164
That's not funny.
That's bullying.

04:55.207 --> 04:56.078
That's not bullying.

04:56.121 --> 04:58.123
Bullying-adjacent.

04:58.167 --> 05:00.604
It's not bullying-anything.

05:10.397 --> 05:13.182
Room 112, there,
on the left.

05:14.792 --> 05:17.795
Commander Torres?
Good morning.

05:17.839 --> 05:20.058
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:20.102 --> 05:22.931
I took a red-eye from
the East Coast last night.No problem.

05:22.974 --> 05:24.759
I'm Special Agent Kensi Blye,
NCIS.

05:24.802 --> 05:26.674
Uh, Detective Marty Deeks, LAPD.

05:26.717 --> 05:28.458
Emilio Torres, her husband.

05:28.502 --> 05:30.330
Has she spoken
to you at all yet?

05:30.373 --> 05:32.680
Not yet. But the CT scan

05:32.723 --> 05:35.813
showed no fractures
or internal bleeding.

05:35.857 --> 05:37.815
That's encouraging.

05:37.859 --> 05:41.166
Now we just have to wait,
hope she wakes up.

05:42.777 --> 05:44.692
Do the doctors know
why she fainted?

05:44.735 --> 05:49.087
They said it wasn't
a heart attack or a stroke.

05:49.131 --> 05:51.089
Uh, we're investigating
some of her concerns.

05:51.133 --> 05:53.657
Did she mention or talk about
anybody wanting to harm her?

05:53.701 --> 05:56.181
Not until I went to Boston.

05:56.225 --> 05:58.096
When was that?Last week.

05:58.140 --> 06:00.925
Here's one of her texts.

06:00.969 --> 06:02.187
"Nausea, headache, fatigue,

06:02.231 --> 06:03.798
"trouble concentrating,
insomnia.

06:03.841 --> 06:05.016
"Don't want to sound paranoid
here, but it feels

06:05.060 --> 06:07.715
like someone is poisoning me."

06:07.758 --> 06:08.933
Did she see a doctor
for any of these symptoms?

06:08.977 --> 06:10.979
We decided to wait just a bit

06:11.022 --> 06:12.850
in case it was a virus
that would pass.

06:12.894 --> 06:14.461
Did they check her out
for poisoning?

06:14.504 --> 06:15.853
Did a urine test.

06:15.897 --> 06:17.420
Negative for drugs
of abuse.

06:17.464 --> 06:20.292
Well, we have Navy toxicologists
that can weigh in on that.

06:20.336 --> 06:21.772
Just to search for anything
more exotic,

06:21.816 --> 06:24.166
like heavy metals
or perhaps a nerve agent.

06:24.209 --> 06:25.950
Nerve agent?

06:25.994 --> 06:27.212
Like when the
Russians tried

06:27.256 --> 06:29.171
to kill the spy
and his daughter in England?

06:29.214 --> 06:33.088
I think, at this point, we
need to consider everything.

06:38.006 --> 06:39.094
In terms of
the food,

06:39.137 --> 06:40.400
I bought the cream
cheese this morning.

06:40.443 --> 06:42.663
Checked the expiration date.
Nobody else

06:42.706 --> 06:44.229
who ate bagels got sick.

06:44.273 --> 06:47.755
Except, I nearly fainted
when I saw

06:47.798 --> 06:49.496
all that blood,
it's...

06:49.539 --> 06:51.628
happened to me before.Jerome,

06:51.672 --> 06:53.108
have you ever been
on active duty?

06:53.151 --> 06:55.066
No, sir,
I'm in the civil service.

06:55.110 --> 06:56.241
Aha.

06:56.285 --> 06:57.634
That's good to know.

06:57.678 --> 06:59.201
How long have you worked
for Commander Torres?

06:59.244 --> 07:01.159
Two and a half years.

07:01.203 --> 07:03.074
You answer her calls?I do.

07:03.118 --> 07:04.859
And you attend all
of her meetings?

07:04.902 --> 07:06.469
Every one, every day.

07:06.513 --> 07:08.340
You ever heard anyone get mad,

07:08.384 --> 07:09.559
or say anything
threatening to her?

07:09.603 --> 07:10.778
Never.

07:10.821 --> 07:12.388
She's a very polite woman,
even to the guys

07:12.432 --> 07:13.998
that vacuum the floor
or pick up the trash.

07:14.042 --> 07:15.652
We need a list

07:15.696 --> 07:16.958
of everyone who
reports to her.

07:17.001 --> 07:19.439
JEROME: Consider it done.CALLEN: Huh.

07:19.482 --> 07:21.484
We saw security camera footage

07:21.528 --> 07:22.790
that was shot
from the back of the room.

07:22.833 --> 07:24.313
Do these cameras
record as well?

07:24.356 --> 07:25.532
JEROME:
They do.

07:25.575 --> 07:26.881
We teleconference
with three cameras

07:26.924 --> 07:28.752
so we can cover
whoever's speaking.

07:28.796 --> 07:32.452
Can we see this morning's
meeting from that angle?

07:36.586 --> 07:38.893
SAM:
Who's that sitting
next to your boss?

07:38.936 --> 07:40.242
Uh, Walter Purdue,

07:40.285 --> 07:42.026
ordnance officer,
and Cynthia Zhang,

07:42.070 --> 07:43.898
command safety officer.

07:43.941 --> 07:46.030
We'd like to speak with them.

07:46.074 --> 07:48.076
Oh, right now?

07:48.119 --> 07:49.643
Yeah.Absolutely,

07:49.686 --> 07:53.037
I'll be right back.

07:53.081 --> 07:55.257
This time, don't
look at Torres.

07:55.300 --> 07:57.128
Focus on the other two.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.135
SAM:
He looks unsteady

08:04.179 --> 08:05.659
and she looks like
she's about to vomit.

08:05.702 --> 08:07.965
So whatever hit the commander

08:08.009 --> 08:09.576
probably hit
the two of them as well.

08:25.156 --> 08:27.332
I do remember that.

08:27.376 --> 08:28.420
Uh, definitely light-headed, uh,
could have been low blood sugar.

08:28.464 --> 08:30.858
I went for a run
and skipped breakfast.

08:30.901 --> 08:32.033
There was food
in the room.

08:32.076 --> 08:34.209
I try to avoid carbs.

08:34.252 --> 08:35.732
Mm.After the meeting, I had

08:35.776 --> 08:37.299
a protein bar,
I felt much better.

08:37.342 --> 08:39.127
And you had an
upset stomach?

08:39.170 --> 08:41.477
I was a little nauseated.

08:41.521 --> 08:42.870
Before the meeting?

08:42.913 --> 08:45.437
After. I had wine
with dinner last night.

08:45.481 --> 08:47.091
That can give me gastritis.

08:47.135 --> 08:49.093
Any odors in the room?

08:49.137 --> 08:50.268
I don't think so.

08:50.312 --> 08:52.227
Any powders or
liquids on the table?

08:52.270 --> 08:53.881
Just coffee.

08:53.924 --> 08:56.100
How about strange sounds?

08:56.144 --> 08:58.146
Not that I was aware of.

08:58.189 --> 09:00.191
Uh, I had a little
ringing in my ear,

09:00.235 --> 09:03.281
but not after
she fainted.

09:03.325 --> 09:05.066
Anything out of the ordinary?

09:05.109 --> 09:07.068
Mm-mmm.

09:07.111 --> 09:09.113
Well, thank you
for your time.

09:09.157 --> 09:10.637
We're gonna be here, so if you
think of anything else,

09:10.680 --> 09:12.073
let us know.

09:12.116 --> 09:13.640
What's the word
from the hospital?

09:15.119 --> 09:17.208
She's stable for now.

09:17.252 --> 09:18.645
We'll keep you posted.

09:19.689 --> 09:21.561
Thank you.Thanks.

09:23.475 --> 09:25.434
Well, more people
would be affected

09:25.477 --> 09:27.175
if it was in the air
or in the food.

09:27.218 --> 09:30.134
You had to be sitting right next
to her to get symptoms.

09:36.053 --> 09:38.969
What if something
came in through the window?

09:39.013 --> 09:41.493
Hmm. You mean, like,
a directed energy attack?

09:41.537 --> 09:44.279
Like what hit our embassy
in Cuba and in China.

09:44.322 --> 09:46.542
Well, the symptoms fit.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.413
At first they thought
it was a sonic attack.

09:48.457 --> 09:50.024
Now they're thinking
it was microwaves.

09:50.067 --> 09:52.592
That's a big building.

09:55.246 --> 09:57.858
Microwaves pass through windows,
not walls.

09:59.686 --> 10:02.297
From any floor you have
a direct shot into this room.

10:08.172 --> 10:10.435
Lots of hotel rooms in Acapulco.

10:10.479 --> 10:13.177
Great, go hang
with our cartel friends,

10:13.221 --> 10:14.875
you can drag me
through the desert again.

10:14.918 --> 10:17.138
You know what we should do?
We should just rent an Airstream

10:17.181 --> 10:19.270
and then just hit up
all the national parks.

10:19.314 --> 10:20.271
That sounds fun.

10:20.315 --> 10:21.708
Hmm?Just not honeymoon-worthy.

10:23.274 --> 10:25.625
I think we need to take this
decision out of our hands.

10:25.668 --> 10:27.191
Oh, yeah? How do you
plan on doing that?

10:27.235 --> 10:29.367
I think we write down the name
of all seven continents,

10:29.411 --> 10:31.108
we put it into a hat
and then we pull one out

10:31.152 --> 10:32.327
and whatever that says
we commit to it.

10:32.370 --> 10:35.156
What if we get
something like Antarctica?

10:35.199 --> 10:37.549
I mean, it's like Iceland but
without the cool Viking museums.

10:37.593 --> 10:39.290
We can go hug penguins.

10:39.334 --> 10:40.814
Fun.NELL :
Kens, Deeks.

10:40.857 --> 10:42.380
Yes?NELL: So, the husband's

10:42.424 --> 10:44.382
trip to Boston
was for a conference

10:44.426 --> 10:45.949
at MIT.He's a professor

10:45.993 --> 10:48.169
of astrophysics at Caltech.

10:48.212 --> 10:49.692
Wow, he fancy.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.476
Excuse me,
she's waking up.

10:51.520 --> 10:52.956
Great news.Yeah.

10:54.871 --> 10:56.177
Hey.Hey.

10:56.220 --> 10:58.614
Val, these are the folks
from NCIS.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.268
Hi, I'm Kensi Blye.

11:00.311 --> 11:02.270
Marty Deeks.
How you feeling?

11:02.313 --> 11:04.359
Fine.

11:04.402 --> 11:06.840
Except a headache
the size of Texas.Yeah,

11:06.883 --> 11:09.146
I'm sure. Are you aware
that you fainted?

11:09.190 --> 11:10.321
Yeah.

11:10.365 --> 11:11.627
And I heard about

11:11.671 --> 11:13.281
the 12 stitches in my attic.

11:14.586 --> 11:16.284
Can we please go home?

11:16.327 --> 11:19.722
Unfortunately, they want to, uh,
observe you for a bit.

11:19.766 --> 11:22.420
I'm fine.
I-I don't need to be here.

11:22.464 --> 11:24.771
Let me find your doctor.

11:24.814 --> 11:27.251
Uh, we just have
a few more questions for you.

11:27.295 --> 11:29.210
So, before you fainted,

11:29.253 --> 11:31.386
how were you feeling?Like crap.

11:31.429 --> 11:33.214
There was this...

11:33.257 --> 11:34.737
high-pitched noise...

11:34.781 --> 11:36.391
but nobody else
seemed to hear it.

11:36.434 --> 11:38.175
And then...

11:38.219 --> 11:40.569
the room was spinning and...

11:40.612 --> 11:42.571
I don't know, I woke up here.

11:42.614 --> 11:44.965
This past week,
at home, y-you said you had

11:45.008 --> 11:46.140
other symptoms.

11:46.183 --> 11:47.315
What is that?

11:47.358 --> 11:49.621
What's what?

11:49.665 --> 11:51.449
Commander Torres?
Commander Torres?

11:51.493 --> 11:53.582
Kens.Is she having a seizure?
Commander Torres?

11:53.625 --> 11:55.540
Hey, doc, I need
some help in here.Commander Torres.

11:55.584 --> 11:56.628
Can you hear me?

11:58.239 --> 12:01.068
Commander Torres.

12:01.111 --> 12:04.114
Ready for an update, Eric.Um,

12:04.158 --> 12:06.203
the incident at the hospital
could be a progression

12:06.247 --> 12:09.337
of her head injury, so she's
going in for a repeat head CT.

12:09.380 --> 12:11.121
What about the building?Well,

12:11.165 --> 12:13.341
no suspicious tenants
or businesses,

12:13.384 --> 12:16.387
but if there were attacks
on the conference room and

12:16.431 --> 12:19.347
now at the hospital, that means
that the bad guys are mobile.

12:19.390 --> 12:22.306
We're not completely sure
this was a real attack.

12:22.350 --> 12:24.482
An inner ear infection
could cause ringing,

12:24.526 --> 12:26.441
nausea, vertigo.ERIC: Yeah,

12:26.484 --> 12:28.008
but so can microwaves.

12:28.051 --> 12:29.313
Pulsed radiofrequencies,

12:29.357 --> 12:31.402
if strong enough, can
cause oxidative stress

12:31.446 --> 12:34.666
to nerve cells,
actual physiologic changes.

12:34.710 --> 12:36.930
In Havana,
they all heard something.

12:36.973 --> 12:38.192
NELL:
Right, and they still heard

12:38.235 --> 12:39.933
the sounds after
they covered their ears.

12:39.976 --> 12:42.457
It's called the Frey effect,
or MAE--

12:42.500 --> 12:43.893
microwave auditory effect.

12:43.937 --> 12:45.939
I'm thinking we send monitors
to the hospital.

12:45.982 --> 12:47.723
If there's another attack,
we can catch it.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.290
That's a good plan.

12:49.333 --> 12:51.379
Any luck with the
security cameras?NELL: Yeah, I just

12:51.422 --> 12:53.903
sent you a shot
of the parking structure roof

12:53.947 --> 12:55.165
outside your window,

12:55.209 --> 12:56.427
right after Torres fainted.

13:00.344 --> 13:02.694
Can you fit a microwave
weapon into a car?

13:02.738 --> 13:05.349
If there's enough space.

13:05.393 --> 13:07.395
Well, we got a bunch
of SUVs, minivans...

13:07.438 --> 13:09.789
And it could be any one of them.

13:13.923 --> 13:15.446
Back from CT?

13:15.490 --> 13:17.144
Yeah, everything's good.

13:17.187 --> 13:18.754
Except that's not my wife.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.234
Uh, we've moved her away
from the window.

13:20.277 --> 13:23.367
That is a special agent who
will be in her bed, active

13:23.411 --> 13:25.500
and walking around.We're just trying
to bait another attack.

13:25.543 --> 13:27.110
Where can I find Valerie?

13:27.154 --> 13:28.677
Uh, she's in room 209.

13:28.720 --> 13:30.853
But before you go, I have
a question which may sound odd

13:30.897 --> 13:33.377
and unlikely,
but some researchers think

13:33.421 --> 13:35.162
that these symptoms
could be psychological.

13:35.205 --> 13:36.903
That's ridiculous.

13:36.946 --> 13:39.340
Has she talked about maybe
having more stress at work?

13:39.383 --> 13:41.516
No. She always handles it.

13:41.559 --> 13:42.996
What about home life? Kids?

13:43.039 --> 13:45.085
O-Our daughter's a junior
at Harvard,

13:45.128 --> 13:46.869
I just got to see her
in a play last night.

13:46.913 --> 13:49.654
If anything, there's less stress
now with an empty nest.

13:49.698 --> 13:50.960
Of course, okay, thanks.All right.

13:51.004 --> 13:52.135
You know where to find me.

13:52.179 --> 13:54.485
Yeah, thank you.

13:57.097 --> 13:58.576
All right,
I'm just gonna say it:

13:58.620 --> 14:00.100
with his background in physics,

14:00.143 --> 14:02.493
maybe he's the person
behind all this.

14:02.537 --> 14:04.495
You think he wants
to hurt his own wife?

14:04.539 --> 14:06.062
I mean, think about it.
The attacks at home

14:06.106 --> 14:08.021
didn't start until he
left town, right? And then

14:08.064 --> 14:10.240
today he leaves the room
and she gets hit again. Boom.

14:10.284 --> 14:11.938
I mean, come on,
he's a tenured college professor

14:11.981 --> 14:13.504
with a perfect family.

14:13.548 --> 14:15.811
Brightest lights have
the darkest shadows.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.901
Well, also, on the flip side,
he travels a lot.

14:18.945 --> 14:20.250
She could be
seeing someone else.

14:20.294 --> 14:22.470
Maybe it's her ex,
seeking revenge.

14:22.513 --> 14:23.950
Wow, you have
definitely been watching

14:23.993 --> 14:25.168
too many telenovelas.

14:25.212 --> 14:27.518
Helps me keep my Spanish.

14:27.562 --> 14:29.390
Well, if there is
something fishy going on,

14:29.433 --> 14:31.609
I know just the meerkats
to dig up the dirt.

14:32.959 --> 14:35.831
While Commander Torres is off
duty who's overseeing logistics?

14:35.875 --> 14:37.920
The C.O. gave that
to C.W.O. Purdue.

14:37.964 --> 14:39.269
The ordnance officer?

14:39.313 --> 14:40.967
And I've been assigned
to assist him.

14:41.010 --> 14:44.013
Okay. We requested an increase
in security at the bunkers.

14:44.057 --> 14:46.494
Uh, okay. I'll make sure
that happens.

14:46.537 --> 14:48.409
You see any more unusual
activity, you let us know.

14:48.452 --> 14:49.497
Of course.

14:49.540 --> 14:50.802
Thanks.

14:53.414 --> 14:54.589
ERIC:
Gentlemen,

14:54.632 --> 14:57.200
can we talk?Go ahead, Eric.

14:57.244 --> 14:59.376
So, we've got security footage
from outside the hospital

14:59.420 --> 15:02.336
at the time of the
presumed attack.I am sending that

15:02.379 --> 15:04.425
to Callen, and Sam's
got the still from

15:04.468 --> 15:06.122
the Seal Beach parking
structure this morning.

15:06.166 --> 15:07.123
Hmm. Compare

15:07.167 --> 15:08.559
and contrast.

15:08.603 --> 15:10.692
Same minivans in each photo.

15:10.735 --> 15:12.694
Mm-hmm.Mm-hmm.
It's a silver

15:12.737 --> 15:13.913
Dodge Grand Caravan.

15:13.956 --> 15:15.175
License plate?

15:15.218 --> 15:16.437
Oh, we're still
working on it.

15:16.480 --> 15:17.742
That's got to be them.

15:17.786 --> 15:19.614
Ready to take out
more innocent people.

15:31.887 --> 15:33.367
Can you scoot back
a little bit, 'cause I can't

15:33.410 --> 15:36.631
see past the bangs
and your fancy new haircut.

15:38.850 --> 15:39.982
How's it looking
in there?

15:40.026 --> 15:41.331
Well, she's selling it.

15:41.375 --> 15:43.116
Making it look
like she's getting discharged.

15:43.159 --> 15:44.900
What about the
microwave monitor?

15:44.944 --> 15:46.858
In position, facing the window.

15:46.902 --> 15:49.122
Ready for the next
attack if there is one.

15:49.165 --> 15:50.601
Homina, homina,
homina, homina, homina,

15:50.645 --> 15:52.908
homina-- you ready?You want to do this now?

15:52.952 --> 15:54.214
We could be here all day.

15:54.257 --> 15:55.345
Besides, every passing minute,

15:55.389 --> 15:57.304
rival couples
are dashing our dreams

15:57.347 --> 15:59.436
by booking their honeymoon
packages. Let's get in there.

15:59.480 --> 16:00.698
Okay, but if I pick
something I don't like,

16:00.742 --> 16:02.918
can I pick another one?Nope.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.702
How about you pick one,
I pick one, and then

16:04.746 --> 16:06.052
we just decide
which one we like best?

16:06.095 --> 16:07.401
That defeats the purpose.

16:07.444 --> 16:09.142
No. Okay. Fine, fine.I believe in you.

16:09.185 --> 16:10.621
Um...Big winner, no whammies.

16:10.665 --> 16:12.493
Don't pick Antarctica.

16:13.450 --> 16:16.062
And the winner will be?

16:16.105 --> 16:17.367
What do you got?

16:19.152 --> 16:21.284
Gonna make the announcement
after the break?

16:21.328 --> 16:23.330
South America.

16:23.373 --> 16:25.462
Oh.I can do South America.

16:25.506 --> 16:26.942
I could do Rio de Janeiro.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.857
Galapagos.
Giant turtles.

16:28.900 --> 16:30.119
We could swim
with those iguanas.

16:30.163 --> 16:32.034
We could learn to tango
in Buenos Aires.

16:32.078 --> 16:33.470
See? Huh?

16:33.514 --> 16:35.820
We're making progress,
we're living the dream.

16:35.864 --> 16:37.474
NELL:
Hey, Kens, Deeks,

16:37.518 --> 16:38.998
we've got your
infidelity report here.

16:39.041 --> 16:41.391
Uh, well, not your
infidelity report.

16:41.435 --> 16:42.958
You know, it's not like
we think you're being

16:43.002 --> 16:45.482
unfaithful or not getting along.NELL: Okay, Eric.

16:45.526 --> 16:46.962
I think they know what I meant.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.268
Well, it's important to
chose your words carefully.

16:48.311 --> 16:49.747
Don't you think?

16:49.791 --> 16:52.750
Hmm. I would say.

16:52.794 --> 16:55.449
Moving on to Torres' husband.Yes.

16:55.492 --> 16:57.973
He had no suspicious activity
at the Boston hotel.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.845
One key for the room,
no extravagant charges,

17:00.889 --> 17:02.543
no room service alcohol.

17:02.586 --> 17:05.024
He did, however, have
breakfast at Denny's

17:05.067 --> 17:07.330
with a much younger woman.

17:07.374 --> 17:08.331
His daughter.

17:08.375 --> 17:09.985
Oh, I'm sorry,

17:10.029 --> 17:11.595
did you want to tell
them that, Eric?

17:11.639 --> 17:13.336
KENSI:
What about back at home?

17:13.380 --> 17:15.556
Yeah, so we checked
neighborhood security cams

17:15.599 --> 17:17.471
to see if there was
any deviation

17:17.514 --> 17:19.560
from her normal schedule.
She never

17:19.603 --> 17:22.519
got home late at night
or at the crack of dawn.

17:22.563 --> 17:24.347
There's no visitors
coming and going,

17:24.391 --> 17:26.262
but there was this one thing.

17:26.306 --> 17:28.656
Yeah, a Dodge Caravan
parked outside her house

17:28.699 --> 17:29.874
every night.

17:29.918 --> 17:31.354
Okay, Eric.

17:31.398 --> 17:32.399
You started it.

17:32.442 --> 17:34.140
No, what I did
was unintentional.

17:34.183 --> 17:35.489
DEEKS:
Guys, was the same minivan

17:35.532 --> 17:37.534
outside the conference room
and the hospital?

17:40.189 --> 17:41.538
Apparently so.

17:41.582 --> 17:42.931
KENSI:
So she was getting hit
by microwaves

17:42.974 --> 17:44.976
every night. Explains why
her symptoms were worse.

17:45.020 --> 17:46.413
NELL:
Oh, and before you ask,

17:46.456 --> 17:48.371
I have not found a view
of the license plate.

17:48.415 --> 17:50.025
Whoa. But I did.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.854
I found it on a
traffic cam four blocks

17:52.897 --> 17:55.335
from the hospital.Wow, good for you, Eric.

17:55.378 --> 17:57.772
There's no "I" in "team."

17:57.815 --> 17:59.469
But there is in "Eric."

17:59.513 --> 18:02.907
Just like there's a "U"
in "obnoxious."

18:02.951 --> 18:04.474
DEEKS:
Meerkats.

18:04.518 --> 18:05.910
Lock it down.

18:05.954 --> 18:07.564
License plate

18:07.608 --> 18:10.089
is registered to Reza Lajani.
He's a psychologist

18:10.132 --> 18:12.091
living in Santa Monica.

18:12.134 --> 18:14.310
Well, we're stuck
in Los Alamitos.

18:14.354 --> 18:16.138
Well, Callen and Sam
are on their way.

18:16.182 --> 18:18.358
All right.Hey, guys,

18:18.401 --> 18:21.926
whatever's happening today,
can you please work it out?

18:21.970 --> 18:23.493
Please?

18:23.537 --> 18:25.147
DEEKS:
Do some trust falls?

18:26.061 --> 18:27.367
Yup.

18:27.410 --> 18:28.542
Mm-hmm.Hmm.

18:31.458 --> 18:33.416
You know with 44 days
of vacation time,

18:33.460 --> 18:35.288
you could take almost
two months off?

18:35.331 --> 18:36.985
Now, did you just do
that math in your head?

18:37.028 --> 18:38.421
'Cause I would've had to use
a calculator for that.

18:38.465 --> 18:39.814
Oh, that's
extremely funny,

18:39.857 --> 18:41.729
except you're about to
lose all but 30 days.

18:41.772 --> 18:43.818
Well, then I'd better
take a few days off.To do what?

18:43.861 --> 18:45.994
Well, play some golf.You don't golf.

18:46.037 --> 18:47.604
Binge-watch?

18:47.648 --> 18:49.128
You don't own a TV.

18:49.171 --> 18:50.346
Huh.

18:52.740 --> 18:54.611
Go to Russia?

18:54.655 --> 18:57.136
That sounds like work, not play.

18:59.529 --> 19:01.488
Hello.Hello, ma'am.

19:01.531 --> 19:03.142
Agent Callen, NCIS.

19:03.185 --> 19:04.534
Agent Sam Hanna.

19:04.578 --> 19:06.406
We're looking
for Reza Lejani.

19:06.449 --> 19:07.537
My husband.

19:07.581 --> 19:09.496
He's with a client
in his office.

19:09.539 --> 19:10.932
Uh, something wrong?

19:10.975 --> 19:12.151
His car was

19:12.194 --> 19:13.587
at the scene of a crime.

19:13.630 --> 19:15.676
His Lexus?No, no, no, no.

19:15.719 --> 19:16.938
Dodge minivan.

19:16.981 --> 19:18.461
That's not his car, it's mine.

19:18.505 --> 19:20.420
It's just registered
in his name.

19:20.463 --> 19:22.509
Do you know where that car is?

19:22.552 --> 19:24.163
In the garage.

19:24.206 --> 19:26.208
Where was it
this morning?

19:26.252 --> 19:27.818
In the garage.

19:27.862 --> 19:29.211
What about last night?

19:29.255 --> 19:30.865
On the street.

19:30.908 --> 19:33.433
When we bought our house, this
was a very safe neighborhood.

19:33.476 --> 19:36.087
Now, you leave your car out,
they break the windows,

19:36.131 --> 19:39.526
cut the tires, they...
even take the headlights.

19:39.569 --> 19:41.180
Something happened last night?

19:41.223 --> 19:43.965
I was lucky. All they did
was steal our license plates.

19:44.008 --> 19:46.837
Did you file a police report?I called. They said I'd have

19:46.881 --> 19:49.449
to come in to the station,
and I sent them

19:49.492 --> 19:52.234
our home security video.Can we take

19:52.278 --> 19:53.322
a look at that?Sure.

19:53.366 --> 19:54.671
Yeah?

19:57.413 --> 19:58.719
There's a guy

19:58.762 --> 20:02.375
in the shadows-- he's
wearing a baseball cap.

20:02.418 --> 20:04.377
Facial recognition
can't do anything with that.

20:04.420 --> 20:06.988
Yeah, but we may be able
to get a print.Maybe.

20:07.031 --> 20:08.337
Do you mind if we take
a look in the garage?

20:08.381 --> 20:09.686
No problem.

20:09.730 --> 20:11.732
Thank you.

20:19.305 --> 20:20.610
Got something.

20:20.654 --> 20:24.875
Looks like
a thumbprint.

20:24.919 --> 20:27.835
That's a decent print.

20:27.878 --> 20:32.448
This guy's got any
criminal past, we got him.

20:37.148 --> 20:39.760
Lunch is usually
more than just french fries.

20:39.803 --> 20:42.110
Only thing I could trust
in that whole cafeteria.

20:42.153 --> 20:43.111
Ugh.

20:43.154 --> 20:44.591
They're ice cold.

20:44.634 --> 20:46.375
Too bad we don't have
a microwave, huh?

20:46.419 --> 20:47.942
Really?Too soon?

20:47.985 --> 20:49.596
NELL:
Hey, guys,

20:49.639 --> 20:52.903
the monitor in Torres's room
is screaming off the charts.

20:52.947 --> 20:55.732
It's another microwave attack.
Look for the silver minivan.

20:55.776 --> 20:58.169
I don't see anything on
the street or the parking lot.

20:59.606 --> 21:02.304
There it is.Yup.

21:04.959 --> 21:07.004
Lot of bystanders.Duly noted.

21:08.963 --> 21:10.312
Gun!

21:13.054 --> 21:15.883
Well, whoever owns this car
is gonna be a little upset.

21:15.926 --> 21:18.015
We need to be surgical.Agreed. You first.

21:18.059 --> 21:20.104
Oh... Mm, okay.

21:26.197 --> 21:28.548
Ah... You think
we got him?

21:28.591 --> 21:30.680
Either that or
they're reloading.

21:30.724 --> 21:32.334
Let's find out, shall we?

21:32.378 --> 21:34.336
Federal agents!Driver, roll down your window!

21:34.380 --> 21:36.425
Oh!

21:36.469 --> 21:38.514
There's at least
two men still inside.

21:38.558 --> 21:39.733
Rear passenger,
palms out the window.

21:39.776 --> 21:41.822
Driver, roll down
your window,

21:41.865 --> 21:44.172
throw out your keys.

21:44.215 --> 21:45.739
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

21:47.697 --> 21:49.656
Down! Get down! Get down!

21:51.135 --> 21:52.659
They never listen.Eric and Nell,

21:52.702 --> 21:54.225
they're headed north
on Prospect.

21:54.269 --> 21:57.359
Damage, side window.
Armed and dangerous.

22:09.066 --> 22:10.981
Hey, Kens, we ID'd
your dead guy.

22:11.025 --> 22:12.809
Actually, Nell ID'd
your dead guy.

22:12.853 --> 22:15.116
She did all the heavy lifting.

22:15.159 --> 22:17.423
Wow. Thank you, Eric.

22:17.466 --> 22:19.294
You guys are sounding better.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.383
You want to talk about
what was going on?

22:21.427 --> 22:23.516
Oh, it was nothing.

22:23.559 --> 22:25.213
Sounded like something.

22:25.256 --> 22:27.258
Okay, it was
lunchtime...

22:27.302 --> 22:29.260
And Eric gets hangry.No, I don't.

22:29.304 --> 22:30.610
Okay.

22:30.653 --> 22:33.221
Last night Eric stayed up
late making tuna salad.

22:33.264 --> 22:35.310
Not just any tuna salad,
all right?

22:35.354 --> 22:38.400
Well...This is an award-winning
blend of parsley,

22:38.444 --> 22:40.750
dill, Bermuda onions, capers,

22:40.794 --> 22:42.317
cranberries, almonds,

22:42.361 --> 22:45.146
and Dijon mayonnaise.

22:45.189 --> 22:47.670
Sounds delicious.
Thanks, Angel.

22:47.714 --> 22:49.193
Well, it
could've been.

22:49.237 --> 22:50.456
I said I would grab
the sandwiches.

22:50.499 --> 22:53.067
I was running late.

22:53.110 --> 22:54.982
I forgot the
sandwiches.

22:55.025 --> 22:57.332
You know what?
It took some time,

22:57.376 --> 22:58.768
but we worked it out.

22:58.812 --> 23:00.422
Way to go, you two.

23:00.466 --> 23:02.163
I got to be honest,
if Kensi did that to me,

23:02.206 --> 23:03.251
I'd be back on Tinder.

23:03.294 --> 23:04.861
Stop.

23:04.905 --> 23:06.428
What do we know
about our guy?

23:06.472 --> 23:07.603
Okay, so,
Daniel Barnet,

23:07.647 --> 23:09.736
he's an unemployed
electrical engineer.

23:09.779 --> 23:12.565
He's now lost two jobs
due to hostile behavior.

23:12.608 --> 23:14.697
So he has the skills
to build an energy weapon

23:14.741 --> 23:16.003
and the anger to use it.

23:16.046 --> 23:17.396
Was he a match to
Callen's fingerprint?

23:17.439 --> 23:19.310
Uh, negative on that.

23:19.354 --> 23:20.442
So why's he attacking the Navy?

23:20.486 --> 23:22.270
Well, on social media,
he's got a ton

23:22.313 --> 23:24.185
of anti-immigration posts,
and with all that hate,

23:24.228 --> 23:25.926
he and his buddies
may be looking to--

23:25.969 --> 23:27.449
I don't know--
acquire weapons.

23:27.493 --> 23:29.233
Do we know who
he's working for?

23:29.277 --> 23:31.322
Well, he made three calls
to a burn phone today

23:31.366 --> 23:32.759
and sent a few
cryptic text messages

23:32.802 --> 23:35.370
to another anti-immigration guy
named Hayden York.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.981
NELL: We got a Pasadena address
coming your way.

23:46.337 --> 23:48.601
Mr. York, it's the Department of
Water and Power.

23:48.644 --> 23:50.690
We got some complaints.
We'd like to check your faucets

23:50.733 --> 23:52.431
for impurities.Who you looking for?

23:52.474 --> 23:56.391
Oh, my.
Uh, Hayden York.

23:56.435 --> 23:59.133
Out of luck. Dude moved out
three days ago.

23:59.176 --> 24:02.484
And you are?Tangerine. Landlord.

24:02.528 --> 24:03.616
Got a light?

24:03.659 --> 24:06.357
No, I don't.
Detective Marty Deeks, LAPD.

24:06.401 --> 24:08.925
I'm Special Agent
Kensi Blye, NCIS.

24:08.969 --> 24:11.362
Whoa, was he, like,
a serial killer or something?

24:11.406 --> 24:13.974
Not quite. Did he leave
a forwarding address?

24:14.017 --> 24:15.410
Maybe at the post office.

24:15.454 --> 24:16.716
Did he ever have any visitors?

24:16.759 --> 24:19.414
No, guy was a loner,

24:19.458 --> 24:20.807
never looked you in the eye.

24:20.850 --> 24:23.244
Had what they call a, uh,
"lack of social skills,"

24:23.287 --> 24:24.463
you know what I mean?

24:24.506 --> 24:26.029
I do.No.

24:26.073 --> 24:29.468
Weird thing was, he packed
his apartment into a 26-footer

24:29.511 --> 24:30.556
from Move and Groove.

24:30.599 --> 24:34.037
You could've fit
a mansion in that thing.

24:34.081 --> 24:36.083
Really?Whole mansion, huh?

24:36.126 --> 24:37.606
Yeah.

24:37.650 --> 24:40.435
Tell us what you got.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.219
Well, first off,
Hayden York used

24:42.263 --> 24:44.004
a fake driver's license
with a fake address

24:44.047 --> 24:45.396
to rent the
moving truck.

24:45.440 --> 24:48.138
That's big enough to cart off
a ton of weapons.

24:48.182 --> 24:49.792
They have a plan.

24:49.836 --> 24:52.708
Notify Seal Beach. They need to
deny entry to any rental trucks.

24:52.752 --> 24:55.319
That might not work.
The dead guy in the minivan--

24:55.363 --> 24:57.800
he texted York and also called
a burn phone today.

24:57.844 --> 25:00.063
NELL:
And we traced that burn phone

25:00.107 --> 25:02.022
to a mini-mall in Long Beach.
Buyer used cash.

25:02.065 --> 25:06.243
And look who we have exiting
the mall at 7:25 this morning,

25:06.287 --> 25:09.290
right after
the time of the sale.

25:09.333 --> 25:11.727
Walter Purdue,
Ordnance Officer.

25:11.771 --> 25:12.946
Hmm.

25:12.989 --> 25:14.556
What's in the bag, Walter?

25:14.600 --> 25:16.427
Something bigger
than a breakfast burrito.

25:16.471 --> 25:18.386
Perhaps a box with
a prepaid phone?

25:18.429 --> 25:20.954
We wanted Purdue to lock down
all of the bunkers for us.

25:20.997 --> 25:24.392
Well, I'm not so sure
he's following orders.

25:31.181 --> 25:33.140
Castor.

25:33.183 --> 25:34.707
All set.Thank you.

25:34.750 --> 25:35.708
Thank you.

25:35.751 --> 25:37.318
Hello again.

25:37.361 --> 25:39.842
I'm curious to know
what's so important.

25:39.886 --> 25:42.889
There's been a new development
in the case.

25:42.932 --> 25:45.152
Okay.

25:45.195 --> 25:48.547
Yeah, we think we know
who attacked Commander Torres.

25:48.590 --> 25:51.114
Did you make an arrest?

25:56.816 --> 25:59.470
This one's at large.

25:59.514 --> 26:03.387
This one-- he's dead.

26:05.346 --> 26:07.391
Either of them look familiar?

26:07.435 --> 26:10.612
They don't work at Seal Beach.Hmm.

26:10.656 --> 26:13.484
Their accomplice does.

26:15.574 --> 26:19.012
CALLEN:
The dead one, Daniel Barnet,

26:19.055 --> 26:20.274
made three phone calls

26:20.317 --> 26:22.319
to that burn phone you
bought this morning.

26:27.629 --> 26:29.544
And?

26:31.024 --> 26:32.982
They said they
wouldn't hurt Valerie.

26:33.026 --> 26:35.594
It would just get her
off duty for a day.

26:35.637 --> 26:37.204
Why would they
want her off work?

26:37.247 --> 26:39.467
So I'd take over logistics.

26:39.510 --> 26:40.555
And you cooperated?

26:40.599 --> 26:42.470
I had to.

26:42.513 --> 26:44.994
My son is 27.

26:45.038 --> 26:46.692
No health insurance.

26:46.735 --> 26:48.519
Got addicted to methamphetamine
last year.

26:49.564 --> 26:52.088
I'm sorry to hear that.

26:52.132 --> 26:54.743
We tried county rehab.

26:54.787 --> 26:56.745
It was terrible. He relapsed.

26:56.789 --> 26:59.313
I wanted him
to get his life back,

26:59.356 --> 27:01.750
so I paid for the best
90-day residential program.

27:01.794 --> 27:03.665
It worked.

27:05.711 --> 27:07.756
Sounds like you did
the right thing.PURDUE: Yeah.

27:07.800 --> 27:10.193
But it cost me
about a hundred grand.

27:10.237 --> 27:11.934
Money I didn't have.

27:11.978 --> 27:14.545
And with my mortgage, I...

27:14.589 --> 27:17.244
I couldn't qualify for a loan.

27:17.287 --> 27:18.506
So how'd you pay for it?

27:18.549 --> 27:22.728
I borrowed it
from a friend of a friend.

27:24.555 --> 27:25.905
Not a bank.

27:25.948 --> 27:27.646
A loan shark?

27:27.689 --> 27:30.213
I paid off half,

27:30.257 --> 27:32.215
and then he sold the loan
to a guy

27:32.259 --> 27:34.217
who demanded payback
in a week.

27:34.261 --> 27:36.480
I couldn't do it.

27:36.524 --> 27:38.526
He said either pay,

27:38.569 --> 27:39.745
or he'd hurt my family.

27:39.788 --> 27:41.398
Or...

27:42.748 --> 27:44.271
...I could tell him.

27:45.315 --> 27:47.274
You could tell him what?

27:47.317 --> 27:50.407
Something that only
the chief of logistics knows.

27:51.452 --> 27:53.149
Which is?

27:53.193 --> 27:55.151
The routes and schedules

27:55.195 --> 27:57.545
for cruise missile
deliveries this week.

27:58.851 --> 28:00.243
You gave that up?

28:00.287 --> 28:01.941
It's not a security breach,
because they're stupid.

28:01.984 --> 28:03.725
You can't steal
a cruise missile.

28:03.769 --> 28:05.335
They-they weigh 3,000 pounds.

28:05.379 --> 28:08.164
They're tracked and escorted.
Any deviation

28:08.208 --> 28:09.949
triggers an immediate response.

28:09.992 --> 28:11.951
I can have my guys add
extra security to the convoys.

28:11.994 --> 28:13.343
Well, that'd be a great idea,

28:13.387 --> 28:15.171
but I don't think
you're going back to Seal Beach.

28:16.216 --> 28:19.698
You mean today or... longer?

28:20.786 --> 28:22.657
That's a question
for the lawyers.

28:24.746 --> 28:27.488
NELL: Hey, guys,
can we talk in private?

28:27.531 --> 28:30.796
We need you to wait in
the other room. Castor.

28:30.839 --> 28:32.667
Come with me.

28:39.935 --> 28:43.330
So, a cruise missile truck
heading for Seal Beach

28:43.373 --> 28:45.941
unexpectedly exited
the 15 freeway

28:45.985 --> 28:48.509
while traveling through
the Angeles National Forest.

28:48.552 --> 28:51.599
Highway patrol is responding.
Kensi and Deeks are en route.

28:51.642 --> 28:53.775
Both driver and passenger
reported nausea and vertigo

28:53.819 --> 28:54.950
right before the detour.

28:54.994 --> 28:56.386
They got hit with microwaves.

28:56.430 --> 28:57.953
What about the security escort?

28:57.997 --> 29:00.390
Same symptoms.
And Seal Beach lost contact

29:00.434 --> 29:03.176
with both vehicles.

29:16.711 --> 29:17.930
What do we know?

29:17.973 --> 29:20.846
Well, two drivers
in each vehicle.

29:20.889 --> 29:23.022
All four unconscious,
bound and gagged.

29:23.065 --> 29:25.111
Apparently assaulted after
they jumped out to vomit.

29:25.154 --> 29:27.287
What about the payload?Gone.

29:28.897 --> 29:30.464
They worked fast.
They must have backed

29:30.507 --> 29:31.944
the rental truck right to it.

29:31.987 --> 29:33.815
So, how many guys does it take
to move a cruise missile?

29:33.859 --> 29:35.861
Two, if it's on wheeled tracks.

29:35.904 --> 29:38.298
They also left
a little something else behind.

29:43.303 --> 29:45.218
SAM:
Same device

29:45.261 --> 29:46.785
that hit Torres took
out the caravan.

29:46.828 --> 29:49.091
Well, I guess they're done
shooting their microwaves.

29:49.135 --> 29:50.266
Yeah, why use a slingshot
when you have

29:50.310 --> 29:51.920
a weapon of mass destruction?

29:51.964 --> 29:54.270
Could they even fire
a cruise missile?They don't need to.

29:54.314 --> 29:55.663
Could set it off
with a detonator,

29:55.706 --> 29:56.969
take down a high-rise

29:57.012 --> 29:58.753
with 200 feet
of lethal injuries.

29:58.797 --> 30:01.712
We know they have
anti-immigration views.

30:01.756 --> 30:03.932
That doesn't exactly
narrow down their target.DEEKS: Well, if they don't

30:03.976 --> 30:05.804
like Latinos,
they go where they gather,

30:05.847 --> 30:07.283
so, Olvera Street,
soccer games,

30:07.327 --> 30:08.850
downtown churches.

30:08.894 --> 30:10.025
KENSI:
It could also be
an Islamic center,

30:10.069 --> 30:11.679
Coalition for
Immigrant Rights,

30:11.722 --> 30:13.420
I mean, any consulate from
the Middle East, Africa.

30:13.463 --> 30:14.987
We need Kaleidoscope
to find that truck.

30:15.030 --> 30:16.989
before they pull off
another Oklahoma City.

30:29.479 --> 30:30.872
Eric, anything
from Kaleidoscope?

30:30.916 --> 30:32.265
ERIC:
Nada.

30:32.308 --> 30:33.832
These country roads have,
like, zero traffic cams.

30:33.875 --> 30:35.877
Did you look deeper
into that fingerprint?

30:35.921 --> 30:37.574
Yeah. So, the guy who
stole the license plate

30:37.618 --> 30:39.620
had no criminal record,
so we took your advice,

30:39.663 --> 30:42.014
and we checked into all the
administrative databases.

30:42.057 --> 30:43.537
Got a hit.

30:43.580 --> 30:45.191
He's a commercial truck driver

30:45.234 --> 30:46.932
named Richard Matts.Address?

30:46.975 --> 30:48.934
Apartment in Pacoima.

30:48.977 --> 30:52.894
Oh. And he also owns a
cabin near Lytle Creek.

30:52.938 --> 30:54.200
In the Angeles National Forest.

30:54.243 --> 30:55.375
How far is that from us?

30:55.418 --> 30:56.898
Uh... three miles.

30:56.942 --> 30:58.508
That's where they're
prepping the missile.

31:11.957 --> 31:14.089
What do you see?

31:14.133 --> 31:16.526
DEEKS:
They backed the truck
into the driveway.

31:16.570 --> 31:17.832
Nobody visible.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.878
They're probably
working in the back.

31:21.140 --> 31:23.533
Callen, we got
eyes on the truck.

31:23.577 --> 31:25.666
There's only one road out
from the cabin.

31:25.709 --> 31:27.320
Be ready in case they run.

31:27.363 --> 31:28.887
Copy that.

31:40.376 --> 31:42.248
G.

31:42.291 --> 31:44.859
Raccoon's in bad shape.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.078
What do you think-- rabies?

31:46.121 --> 31:47.906
What the hell?

31:47.949 --> 31:50.299
Block your ear.

31:50.343 --> 31:52.519
It's still there.

31:52.562 --> 31:53.999
Microwaves.

31:54.042 --> 31:55.174
You good?

31:55.217 --> 31:56.479
It's not too bad.

31:56.523 --> 31:57.654
Kensi, Deeks,

31:57.698 --> 31:58.873
engage, but stay covered.

31:58.917 --> 32:00.179
They've got another
microwave weapon.

32:00.222 --> 32:02.137
Go.

32:07.055 --> 32:08.013
It's coming
from behind the wall.

32:19.024 --> 32:20.982
Getting worse?

32:21.026 --> 32:23.028
Oh, a little bit of pain.

32:33.038 --> 32:35.257
Okay, that's vertigo.

32:35.301 --> 32:37.085
Same.

32:37.129 --> 32:39.653
Give it a minute.
Maybe it'll pass.

32:44.136 --> 32:46.051
Aah!

32:46.094 --> 32:47.052
Aah!

32:47.095 --> 32:48.836
You hearing that?

32:48.879 --> 32:51.186
Yeah, it's like the morning
after an Iron Maiden concert.

32:51.230 --> 32:53.014
It's microwaves.Well,

32:53.058 --> 32:54.320
maybe that means
they're out of bullets.

32:56.365 --> 32:57.671
Or not.Yeah.

32:57.714 --> 32:59.151
Evidently not.

33:06.941 --> 33:08.464
How's your vertigo?

33:08.508 --> 33:11.337
It's easing up a bit.

33:12.947 --> 33:14.035
Kensi, Deeks,

33:14.079 --> 33:15.341
give 'em everything.

33:15.384 --> 33:16.385
DEEKS:
With pleasure.

33:16.429 --> 33:17.560
Yippee ki-kay.

33:24.132 --> 33:26.091
Oh.

33:26.134 --> 33:28.136
Let's do this!

33:32.140 --> 33:33.098
Oh, my gosh.

33:39.191 --> 33:41.497
Aah!

33:41.541 --> 33:43.021
Are you... are you spinning?

33:43.064 --> 33:45.110
Son of a bitch.
Where's that coming from?

33:45.153 --> 33:47.373
Think it's the microwaves.

33:47.416 --> 33:51.116
Pretty sure this is how
my mom spent the '60s.

33:51.159 --> 33:53.248
Just keep your head down, okay?

33:53.292 --> 33:54.945
Are you gonna be pissed
if I throw up?

33:54.989 --> 33:56.730
Just don't get shot.

33:56.773 --> 33:58.514
Oh, no me gusta.

34:19.144 --> 34:22.321
Two guys, two shots.

34:26.194 --> 34:27.674
Microwave disabled.

34:30.807 --> 34:33.071
Shooter down!

34:33.114 --> 34:34.855
There could be more
inside the cabin.

34:38.163 --> 34:40.121
Kensi, Deeks,
truck's headed your way.

34:40.165 --> 34:41.253
KENSI:
Got it.

34:44.169 --> 34:47.085
Serious firepower.

34:47.128 --> 34:48.347
Sam.

34:48.390 --> 34:49.739
That could come in handy.

34:49.783 --> 34:51.132
Like now.

34:58.226 --> 35:01.142
Sorry, gentlemen. We just didn't
feel like paying for valet.

35:01.186 --> 35:03.884
Guys, you need
to clear away

35:03.927 --> 35:05.190
in a hurry.How far?

35:05.233 --> 35:06.626
At least a hundred yards.

35:06.669 --> 35:08.889
Let's go.

35:14.895 --> 35:16.592
Why is he backing up?

35:16.636 --> 35:19.073
Probably trying to make a run at
the Audi, knock it off the road.

35:21.075 --> 35:22.598
CALLEN:
I don't mean to be
a back-seat shooter,

35:22.642 --> 35:26.036
but you might want
to avoid the cargo space.Thanks.

35:28.604 --> 35:30.171
Moving target.

35:30.215 --> 35:32.217
You got it?I got it.

35:50.235 --> 35:53.760
Well, the Audi may be a little
dinged up from the shrapnel,

35:53.803 --> 35:56.545
but, otherwise,
I'd say it's pretty good.

35:56.589 --> 35:58.808
Pretty good indeed.

36:03.552 --> 36:04.945
One, two, three.

36:07.252 --> 36:09.471
Wow.
That could have caused

36:09.515 --> 36:10.690
some real damage.

36:10.733 --> 36:11.908
Do we need to render it safe?

36:11.952 --> 36:13.214
No.

36:13.258 --> 36:15.216
They didn't have time
to rig the detonator.

36:15.260 --> 36:17.087
Okay, thanks.

36:17.131 --> 36:19.220
Commander Torres
is headed home.

36:19.264 --> 36:21.266
Purdue is gonna be downgraded
to a non-classified position.

36:21.309 --> 36:24.747
The U.S. attorney will offer
him a year of weekends in jail.

36:24.791 --> 36:26.619
Well, that sounds reasonable.

36:26.662 --> 36:28.577
Anybody else's
ears still ringing?

36:28.621 --> 36:30.536
Yeah.Oh, yeah, definitely.

36:30.579 --> 36:33.060
Short-term effects should be
gone within 24 hours.

36:33.103 --> 36:34.496
We're lucky,

36:34.540 --> 36:36.759
unlike the diplomats
who got hit every day.

36:36.803 --> 36:38.587
Oh, we're still gonna have
to have our hearing tested.

36:38.631 --> 36:40.372
What?Hearing tested.

36:40.415 --> 36:41.938
We'll have to have
our hearing tested.

36:41.982 --> 36:43.418
Well, in the meantime,
I think I can offer

36:43.462 --> 36:45.551
some symptomatic relief.

36:45.594 --> 36:48.162
Shall we?
Shotgun!

36:55.865 --> 36:57.737
Thanks, Mama B.

36:57.780 --> 36:59.739
This is like Star Wars,

36:59.782 --> 37:02.481
you guys getting shot at
with particle beams.

37:02.524 --> 37:04.700
Uh, they were microwaves.

37:04.744 --> 37:06.702
Like my microwave oven?

37:06.746 --> 37:08.138
Any chance

37:08.182 --> 37:09.227
that could fry my brain?

37:09.270 --> 37:11.141
Only if you get inside.

37:16.364 --> 37:19.324
All right, round two
if you're ready for it.Yes, please.

37:19.367 --> 37:20.455
Thank you.CALLEN:
You making

37:20.499 --> 37:22.849
any progress
with the honeymoon planning?

37:22.892 --> 37:24.242
Hmm?DEEKS:
Well, funny you should ask,

37:24.285 --> 37:26.287
because we got it all dialed in.

37:26.331 --> 37:27.419
That was quick.

37:27.462 --> 37:29.203
KENSI :
Yeah, real quick.

37:29.247 --> 37:30.465
We've decided on Peru.

37:30.509 --> 37:32.075
Nice.

37:32.119 --> 37:33.468
They've got diseases in Peru.

37:33.512 --> 37:34.643
DEEKS:
Mama,

37:34.687 --> 37:36.166
they got diseases everywhere.

37:36.210 --> 37:38.778
I watch this cable show-- Bizarre Infections.

37:38.821 --> 37:40.170
Oh, God.This woman came back

37:40.214 --> 37:44.305
from Peru with Zika, malaria,
and river blindness.

37:44.349 --> 37:46.264
Mm.Yeah. No, we'll
be careful.

37:46.307 --> 37:47.917
Just don't get pregnant
down there,

37:47.961 --> 37:49.354
okay?Okay.

37:49.397 --> 37:50.355
I know honeymooners.
You two are gonna be

37:50.398 --> 37:52.182
doing it like bonobos.Oh, my...

37:52.226 --> 37:53.358
Mom!
I'm serious.

37:53.401 --> 37:56.578
Just think about two forms
of contraception--

37:56.622 --> 37:58.885
belt and suspenders,
rubbers and a raincoat.

37:58.928 --> 38:00.539
DEEKS:
Okay!Oh, God.

38:00.582 --> 38:02.323
You know what? That delivery in
the back ain't unpacking itself.

38:02.367 --> 38:03.759
You need help with that,
or you good?

38:03.803 --> 38:05.370
No, I don't need help
with anything.Okay.

38:05.413 --> 38:06.675
Do you need any help?No, I'm good.

38:06.719 --> 38:08.503
Why don't you work on
that cash register.

38:08.547 --> 38:10.026
You know how to work it?I'll... You know what,
if something goes wrong,

38:10.070 --> 38:11.289
I'll call you.It's not digital. Okay.

38:11.332 --> 38:13.203
Oh, my God,
I can't believe this woman.

38:13.247 --> 38:15.380
This is the best idea ever.

38:15.423 --> 38:17.382
So, Peru, huh?Mm-hmm.

38:17.425 --> 38:19.209
What is that, uh,
Machu Picchu?

38:19.253 --> 38:22.125
Hmm.Uh, yeah, maybe,
if we have time.

38:22.169 --> 38:23.431
Yeah, we're actually
making a volunteer trip.

38:23.475 --> 38:24.780
We're gonna stay
at a village.

38:24.824 --> 38:26.086
Huh.DEEKS:
So we're building houses

38:26.129 --> 38:27.435
and digging irrigation ditches,

38:27.479 --> 38:29.437
and, you know, teaching English.

38:29.481 --> 38:31.265
Mm.Oh, that sounds romantic.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.267
Good for you.

38:33.311 --> 38:35.225
How did you
finally decide?

38:35.269 --> 38:37.010
Oh, well, we picked it out
of a hat.

38:37.053 --> 38:38.359
Hmm.DEEKS: Compared
with the rest of the world,

38:38.403 --> 38:41.101
we have everything,
so we thought this would be

38:41.144 --> 38:44.322
an amazing opportunity
to make a difference.

38:44.365 --> 38:46.628
Hmm.Yeah. We might have
to hold off on it, though,

38:46.672 --> 38:49.152
because, um,
this place needs a pick-up.

38:49.196 --> 38:50.284
Oh.CALLEN:
Yeah, it is

38:50.328 --> 38:53.374
a little quiet tonight,
but I think

38:53.418 --> 38:54.593
the solution
could be karaoke.

38:54.636 --> 38:56.334
Want to sing
some Neil Diamond? No.No.

38:56.377 --> 38:58.205
No. no, kar... no karaoke.

38:58.248 --> 38:59.337
How about lucha libre?

38:59.380 --> 39:01.600
Mexican masked wrestling?

39:01.643 --> 39:03.515
DEEKS:
See, now, that is a genius idea.I like it.

39:03.558 --> 39:04.603
Put a ring right there,

39:04.646 --> 39:05.778
luchadores flying
through the air--

39:05.821 --> 39:07.519
this place would be packed
in no time.

39:07.562 --> 39:09.477
Are you serious?No!

39:09.521 --> 39:11.392
Oh!It's a terrible idea.

39:11.436 --> 39:12.437
Stop!It the worst idea

39:12.480 --> 39:13.960
I've ever heard in my...

39:14.003 --> 39:15.178
I don't want any gimmicks.

39:15.222 --> 39:16.745
I don't want trivia night,
I don't want

39:16.789 --> 39:18.399
game night.
I just want

39:18.443 --> 39:19.879
this place to...

39:19.922 --> 39:22.185
I just want it
to feel like home, you know?

39:22.229 --> 39:23.970
Mm. That it does.

39:24.013 --> 39:25.319
That's because it isyour home.

39:25.363 --> 39:26.538
You live upstairs.KENSI:
Yeah.

39:26.581 --> 39:27.930
And that is a good point.

39:27.974 --> 39:29.454
Well, it feels
like home to me.

39:29.497 --> 39:31.281
Yeah, but you live
on a boat.

39:31.325 --> 39:34.023
I think that automatically
disqualifies you.

39:34.067 --> 39:35.982
You know what,
how about a toast?

39:36.025 --> 39:39.855
To the bar with no name.

39:39.899 --> 39:41.422
♪ You can't stop...

39:41.466 --> 39:43.424
No Name Bar. Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.

39:43.468 --> 39:45.774
KENSI:
There's no place like home.

39:45.818 --> 39:47.559
CALLEN, SAM and DEEKS:
