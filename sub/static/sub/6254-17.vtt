Asteroid mining?

01:23.960 --> 01:26.542
Yeah, asteroid mining.
I did my research, okay?

01:26.629 --> 01:28.415
The head of the Jet Propulsion Lab
says it’s possible,

01:28.506 --> 01:31.088
and the two guys who sent
the rover to Mars, they agree.

01:31.175 --> 01:34.838
The microgravity technologies
required to do so
don’t even exist, Booth.

01:34.971 --> 01:38.213
You know what? There was a time
when radios and railroads,
they didn’t exist.

01:38.307 --> 01:40.013
But people, they got rich.

at me like that?

Every time I have
a good idea— Never mind.
Just look at the bones.

01:45.022 --> 01:47.513
Why did the farmer
run over the remains?

01:47.608 --> 01:49.724
He was an investment banker

01:49.819 --> 01:52.310
I’m guessing the tractor
didn’t handle like his Beemer.

01:52.405 --> 01:56.068
Well, according to the shallow
grave here, Shish Kebab,
he was definitely murdered.

01:56.158 --> 01:59.150
The presence
of Nicrophorus americanus,
along with some of its larvae,

01:59.245 --> 02:01.110

took place five days ago.

Hey. Do you believe
in asteroid mining?

a masters in both astronomy
and wildlife ecology,

05:34.877 --> 05:38.085

of a masters in forensic
anthropology.

should read the e—mails...

“Intern Resumes.”

05:44.553 --> 05:45.884

It’s like getting five interns
for the price of one.

brought me
the skull...

05:50.226 --> 05:51.932
in a bag
made of
recycled plastic,

05:52.019 --> 05:53.680
which produces
condensaﬂon,

05:53.771 --> 05:56.854
which could have
severely compromised
crucial evidence.

05:56.941 --> 06:00.183
Which is why I rushed the skull
to you at the diner, Dr. Brennan.

06:00.319 --> 06:02.901
You see, condensation starts
after three hours.
[ Device Beeps ]

06:02.988 --> 06:05.024

in an hour and 45 minutes.

06:05.115 --> 06:06.616
That’s simple physics.

was recycled, so...

to suspect that this skull
was removed...

06:32.393 --> 06:34.224
by anything other than
the coyotes.

06:34.311 --> 06:37.519
So... not a zombie?

06:37.606 --> 06:40.689
Zombies have to be beheaded
or they eat your brains.

06:40.776 --> 06:44.143
There are no such things as
zombies or vampires or ghosts.

06:44.238 --> 06:49.608
The first law of thermodynamics
states that energy is neither
created nor destroyed.

06:49.702 --> 06:52.910
So when we die, all that energy
has to go somewhere, right?

06:52.997 --> 06:55.864
I believe that if we die
with an abundance of this power,

06:55.958 --> 06:58.870
it can become forever imprinted
on the immediate environment.

06:59.003 --> 07:01.745
And that imprint,
that’s our ghost?
Mm—hmm.

Ooh, ghosty.

07:16.645 --> 07:20.183
The guy literally fought off
coyotes to get the skull back?
Yeah.

07:20.316 --> 07:23.183
That’s awesome.
Coyotes, they just run away
if you yell at them.

07:23.277 --> 07:26.895
I know, but still,
to face a pack
of wild animals alone.

07:26.989 --> 07:29.480
I’m sure you’d just
bore them to death

Wow.
Yeah, wow.

07:36.915 --> 07:39.782
So, the brother is
the victim’s only family
that you found?

07:39.877 --> 07:44.211
So far. Hodgins found
traces of glow—in-the-dark
auto paint in the victim’s nose.

07:44.298 --> 07:47.790
It’s rare stuff apparently,
and he traced it back to
the brother’s auto body shop.

07:47.885 --> 07:51.173
Driving a glow-in-the-dark car

feature, doesn’t it?

Okay, given the choice,
would you rather have
your brain in a beetle’s body...

in your body?

Okay. All right, |’|| bite.

09:14.847 --> 09:18.681
If my brain were in a beetle’s body,
then I would be king of the beetles,

09:18.767 --> 09:20.382
just like I’m king of the lab.

09:20.477 --> 09:21.933
There, what does
that answer tell ya?

09:22.020 --> 09:25.057
It tells me you not only feel
like you belong here,

09:25.149 --> 09:28.141
but that this is your domain
and you love it.

09:28.235 --> 09:31.443

— I can’t argue with any of that.

Contusion on the occipital bone,
roughly 20 millimeters in diameter.

09:35.909 --> 09:40.278
Staining suggests
that the trauma occurred
around the time of death.

09:40.372 --> 09:43.785
Dr. Brennan prefers we use terms
like “conked on the noggin.”

09:43.876 --> 09:47.118
The beetle question
also told me that
you’re mischievous...

09:47.212 --> 09:48.873

question tell you?

You got picked on a lot
in high school, didn’t you?

10:03.020 --> 10:04.851
I didn’t kill Benji.

Uh, that man was
the love of my life.

10:08.317 --> 10:12.560
So it was Benji
who broke up with you?
Seriously?

10:12.654 --> 10:15.191
Look at me.
I am the one

he decided that he needed
to restore one just like it.

10:37.346 --> 10:39.132
So what did he do
the rest of the time?

10:39.223 --> 10:42.386
His experiments,
which I did not resent.

10:42.476 --> 10:46.060
- Why?
— They were scientific experiments.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.603
Benji was— [ Exclaims]
wicked smart.

10:48.690 --> 10:51.352
Except when it came
to the stupid truck.

10:51.443 --> 10:55.356
I know some scientists,
and they’re specific about
their branch of science.

10:55.447 --> 10:57.028
Time travel.

10:57.115 --> 11:01.484
— What?
— Benji was into... time travel?

11:01.578 --> 11:05.662
Not time—share, like condos,
but traveling... through time?

11:05.749 --> 11:08.411
Yeah. He wanted to be
the first to do it.

11:08.502 --> 11:10.834
Okay, so Benji wanted
to be a time traveler,

11:10.921 --> 11:12.752
but you were mad at him
because of a truck?

11:12.840 --> 11:15.126
Duh. One was gonna
make us a lot of money.

11:15.217 --> 11:17.128
The other was just
a stupid truck.

11:17.219 --> 11:19.926
- When was the last time
you talked to Benji?
— Last Saturday night.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.550
— [ Scoffs ] We argued.
— About the truck?

11:22.641 --> 11:24.927
Courtney, that was the night
that he was killed.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.304
Did he say anything
that could lead
to his killer?

11:27.396 --> 11:29.978
[ Chuckles ]
He said he was too busy.

11:30.065 --> 11:34.024
— With his truck.
— Of course. His truck.

11:34.111 --> 11:36.727
Would you choose a truck
over this?

11:41.869 --> 11:43.700
[ Chuckling ]
All right, guy.
Seriously.

11:43.787 --> 11:45.402
Is she crazy enough
to kill someone?

11:45.539 --> 11:49.282
She seems to display
some of the symptoms
of Intermittent Explosive Disorder.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.037
What does that mean?
She gets mad?

11:51.128 --> 11:55.292
LED. is usually characterized
by sporadic episodes
of extreme aggression,

11:55.382 --> 11:57.464
violence and destructive behavior.

11:57.551 --> 11:59.007
Sweets, could she kill him?

12:00.387 --> 12:03.971
If she was at the mercy
of her own anger, yeah.
Yeah.

12:14.526 --> 12:17.313
What are you eating,
Dr. Wells?

12:17.404 --> 12:19.941
String cheese.
You want some string cheese?

12:20.032 --> 12:22.023
Eaﬂnginthelab
is strictly prohibited.

12:22.117 --> 12:24.904
Whenever I’m working
on a conundrum,
I always eat string cheese.

12:24.995 --> 12:27.577
It started in grade school,
and I was getting ready
for the science fair.

12:27.706 --> 12:29.571
Which I won.
I don’t care.

12:29.666 --> 12:31.372
Thought—controlled
prosthetic limbs...

12:31.460 --> 12:35.578
and the elimination
of artifact distraction
from E.E.G. signal processing.

12:35.672 --> 12:38.835
I’m pretty sure
you care about that.
I was 13 years old.

12:38.967 --> 12:43.301
We’re concerned with these
bones now. Nothing more.
Right.

12:43.388 --> 12:48.257
The, uh, cheese made me think
of calcium, which is important
for bone growth,

12:48.352 --> 12:51.810
and that brought my attention
to the scoliosis...

12:51.897 --> 12:53.558
from which the victim suffered.

12:53.649 --> 12:56.391
I also found incomplete
perimortem fractures...

12:56.485 --> 12:59.477
to the right anterolateral
tibia and fibula.

12:59.571 --> 13:03.905
You gotta admit,
I’m pretty impressive.

13:03.992 --> 13:06.074
Until recently
on the isle of Vanuatu,

13:06.161 --> 13:08.652
you could be cannibalized for
disobeying your tribal chief.

13:08.747 --> 13:13.161
And you could have been forced
to give your child to my clan
to settle this petty conflict.

13:13.251 --> 13:14.991
You’re familiar with the Vanuatu?

13:15.087 --> 13:17.123
My knowledge is vast.
Which is why I’m here, right?

13:17.214 --> 13:19.830
So don’t try to cherry—pick facts
to win an argument.

13:19.925 --> 13:22.632
Then let’s deal with our tribe.

13:22.719 --> 13:24.380
You have not yet found
cause of death.

13:24.471 --> 13:27.008
Finish rearticulating
these bones as ordered,

13:27.140 --> 13:29.597
or you will be banished.
[Thuds ]

13:36.566 --> 13:38.102
Double mocha latte.

13:38.235 --> 13:41.318
Oh. God’s perfect food.
Ithought
that was pizza.

13:41.405 --> 13:44.272
Well, you need something
to wash it down with.

13:44.366 --> 13:46.072
Did you find anything
in Benji’s clothes?

13:46.159 --> 13:49.743
Well, a couple
of strawberry seeds
in his shoe tread.

13:49.830 --> 13:52.742
Were there any strawberries
on the farm where he was buried?

13:52.833 --> 13:54.664
No, but they are grown
pretty much everywhere else.

13:54.793 --> 13:58.081
So it doesn’t help much
in determining what he was doing
on the night of his death.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.753
- Well, how about you?
— Well, Courtney’s alibi
checked out.

14:00.841 --> 14:04.504
She was hating
on a deejay at a club.

14:04.594 --> 14:06.755
So I looked into
Benji’s hard drive.

14:06.847 --> 14:11.591
It’s filled with headache—inducing
theories on time travel.

14:11.685 --> 14:16.304
Awesome. Wow.
Time dilation.

14:16.398 --> 14:20.186
Relativistic velocities.
This kid was pretty smart.

14:20.277 --> 14:23.189
He was trying to go back,
not forward.

14:23.280 --> 14:26.022
What difference
does that make?
This is all crazy.

14:26.116 --> 14:29.199
Not really. See, Einstein tells us
that traveling into the future...

14:29.286 --> 14:31.026
is theoretically possible,

14:31.121 --> 14:34.079
but visiting the past,
now that gets into causality,

14:34.166 --> 14:35.952
and everything starts
falling apart.

14:36.043 --> 14:38.079
Do you think
he really thought
that he could do it?

14:38.170 --> 14:40.206
Oh, man,
wouldn’t you want to?

14:40.297 --> 14:45.166
I would go back
to April 19, 2004,
the moment I first met you.

14:46.720 --> 14:50.178
You had a rubber band
on your wrist and a spider
on your shoulder.

14:50.265 --> 14:52.096
[ Chuckles ]
That’s right.
What about you?

14:52.184 --> 14:54.095
If you could go back,
what moment would you choose?

14:55.812 --> 15:00.226
I would choose that one.
I would choose that—
I would choose that same moment.

15:00.317 --> 15:02.649
You had to take a minute
to think about that.
Are you sure?

15:02.736 --> 15:05.193
Yes, I am—
I’m sure.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.862
Give me this.

15:07.949 --> 15:09.905
One other thing that I found.

15:09.993 --> 15:13.702
Benji was spending
a lot of time on the
Collindale University server,

15:13.789 --> 15:17.247
which is very weird
because he wasn’t
a student there.

15:17.334 --> 15:21.043
He was logged in
as Professor Scott Hunter.

15:21.129 --> 15:23.415
[Hodgins ] Hunter.
He’s a theoretical physicist.

15:23.507 --> 15:25.919
You know, a lot of Benji’s math
was pretty sophisticated.

15:26.009 --> 15:27.545
I wonder if they were
working together on that.

15:27.677 --> 15:31.261
On time travel?
Yeah, theoretical physicists
can be pretty weird.

15:31.348 --> 15:33.339
I’ll tell Booth
to look into Hunter.

15:35.018 --> 15:37.350
You sure you didn’t want to
go back to some other time?

15:38.647 --> 15:41.138
Nope. That time.

15:43.527 --> 15:45.518
Yeah, okay.
[ Chuckles ] Okay.

15:52.536 --> 15:54.322
[ Sweets ]
People become obsessed
with time travel...

15:54.412 --> 15:57.779
either because they’re missing something
or they’re running away from something.

15:57.874 --> 16:00.456
Well, according to his brother,
Benji had a pretty
rough childhood.

16:00.544 --> 16:02.751
I mean, come on.
Why would anyone want
to revisit that?

16:02.838 --> 16:06.751
Because that’s where he felt
that he lost a part of himself.

16:06.842 --> 16:10.380
I think he wanted to go back
to stop his dad from leaving.

16:10.470 --> 16:14.133
- What? He was trying to save
his family from falling apart?
— Yes. Exactly.

16:14.224 --> 16:19.139
Look, everyone at some point
has wanted to go back.

16:19.229 --> 16:22.767
l— I wish I could,
to see the Finleys again.

16:22.858 --> 16:24.814
The couple that adopted me.

16:24.901 --> 16:28.689
They saved my life,
and I was... a kid.

16:30.782 --> 16:32.738
I gave ’em a rough time.
I don’t know.

16:32.826 --> 16:38.412
ljust wish I could
go back and let ’em know
how much I appreciate them.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.114
They know.

16:43.003 --> 16:45.085
Um, you said
you found something?

16:45.172 --> 16:46.537
Yeah.

16:46.631 --> 16:48.792
This guy, uh,
Professor Hunter,
might be someone else...

16:48.884 --> 16:51.921
who’s, uh, looking
for a do—over.

16:55.265 --> 16:57.802
Taught physics at Collindale
till two years ago,

16:57.893 --> 16:59.474
when he was fired
for electrocuting a student?

16:59.561 --> 17:02.052
He was also
supposed to meet Benji
the night he was killed.

17:05.358 --> 17:09.146
Dr. Brennan, given the choice,
would you rather be run over
by one steamroller...

17:09.237 --> 17:10.818
or by 1,000 mopeds?

17:12.073 --> 17:14.485
Why would you ask
such a preposterous question?

17:14.576 --> 17:18.569
Dr. George did psychological
experiments at Cambridge
on bias and judgment forma—

17:18.663 --> 17:22.656
I don’t like psychology.
And I’m not the one
we’re studying here.

17:22.751 --> 17:25.208
Sorry.

17:25.295 --> 17:29.288
Would that be
one moped 1,000 times,
or 1,000 mopeds at once?

17:29.382 --> 17:31.418
It doesn’t matter.
You’d choose the steamroller.

17:31.509 --> 17:34.421
By the time it had run over your legs,
you’d already be dead from shock.

17:34.512 --> 17:36.548
It fits in with your
hyperrational outlook.

17:36.640 --> 17:39.552
Please don’t pretend to know
how my mind works.

17:39.684 --> 17:44.474
You shy away from randomness,
and that prevents you
from casting a wide net.

17:46.316 --> 17:49.058
Are you saying
that I’m narrow—minded?

17:49.152 --> 17:51.393
Your words, not mine.

17:51.488 --> 17:54.651
That’s interesting.
There appears to be microfracturing...

17:54.741 --> 17:58.859
to the anterior and posterior aspects
of right sternal ribs nine and 10.

17:58.954 --> 18:01.866
As well as
the anterior aspect...

18:01.957 --> 18:04.949
of the right vertebral ribs
11 and 12.

18:05.043 --> 18:07.250
So whatever created this damage
also created...

18:07.337 --> 18:09.328
some pretty horrific damage
to the liver as well.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.538
Which would have certainly
caused his death.

18:11.633 --> 18:14.591
Didn’t Agent Booth
say that the professor
that Benji was working with...

18:14.678 --> 18:16.634
once electrocuted a student?

18:16.721 --> 18:20.384
If a current passed
through the thoracic region
with enough voltage,

18:20.475 --> 18:24.559
it could certainly have created
the fracturing on the bone.

18:25.939 --> 18:28.555
No wide net needed.

18:33.738 --> 18:36.946
[ Brennan ]
Professor Hunter got fired
for electrocuting a student.

18:37.033 --> 18:39.945
Losing university resources
could drive Hunter...

18:40.036 --> 18:41.947
to start working
with outsiders
such as Benji.

18:42.038 --> 18:45.451
Experiment that goes wrong.
Benji gets electrocuted.

18:45.542 --> 18:48.124
And knowing that he
could be convicted
of negligent homicide,

18:48.211 --> 18:50.577
Hunter decides to,
what, dump the body?

18:50.672 --> 18:53.084
You’re casting a wide net.

18:53.174 --> 18:54.334
Huh?

18:54.426 --> 18:56.542
By positing various motives.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.924
I don’t do that, apparently.
Rather be run over
by a steamroller.

19:00.015 --> 19:02.973
[ Chuckles ] What?
You want to be run over
by a steamroller?

19:03.059 --> 19:06.927
Yes. Instead of
a thousand mopeds,
of course.

19:07.022 --> 19:10.480
I’m—I’m sor—
What am I hearing right now?
Am I having a stroke?

19:10.567 --> 19:13.229
Dr. Wells defined me, with ease.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.811
I don’t like that.
Even if he’s correct.

19:15.905 --> 19:17.987
I’d love to help you here,
Bones,

19:18.074 --> 19:21.111
but I really have
absolutely no idea
what you’re talking about.

19:21.202 --> 19:24.945
It’s fine, Booth.
Maybe Dr. Wells is right.

19:25.040 --> 19:27.326
Maybe I’m narrow—minded.

19:27.417 --> 19:29.453
[ Under Breath ]
Wow.

19:32.380 --> 19:34.245
Nah. No. What?

19:37.260 --> 19:39.501
[ Brennan ]
Odd for a professor
of theoretical physics...

19:39.596 --> 19:41.507
to be working
with someone
without a degree.

19:41.598 --> 19:43.179
Benjamin read
an article I’d written.

19:43.266 --> 19:46.349
He knew I was conducting
experiments in time travel
and wanted to help.

19:46.436 --> 19:49.894
— So, he just showed up
at your doorstep one day?
— Basically, yes.

19:49.981 --> 19:52.393
It was about a year ago.
We’ve been working
together ever since.

19:52.484 --> 19:56.022
Including the night that he died.
We’ve pinpointed time of death.

19:56.112 --> 19:57.898
You think I killed Benjamin?

19:57.989 --> 20:01.481
I mean, accidents do happen,
but you know that all too well,
now, don’t you, Professor?

20:01.576 --> 20:03.612
This is ludicrous.
You can’t be serious.

20:03.703 --> 20:07.662
Sometimes these accidents
are just so big, you just try to
cover them up. Isn’t that right?

20:07.749 --> 20:09.831
We need to see your lab,
Professor.

20:09.918 --> 20:12.785
At-At least
put on a gown.

20:12.879 --> 20:15.416
You’re contaminating
the entire facility.

20:15.507 --> 20:18.340
Please, Dr. Brennan,
from one scientist to another.

20:18.426 --> 20:21.042
That’s for my metamaterial experiment.
Please don’t touch that.

20:21.179 --> 20:23.511
Oh.
Whoa. Exposed wiring.

20:23.598 --> 20:25.930
You seem to make a habit
out of being negligent, Professor.

20:26.017 --> 20:28.929
[ Brennan ]
This is a 240—volt battery.

20:29.020 --> 20:32.057
If Benji came into contact
with these wires,

20:32.148 --> 20:35.857
it could have created
the fracturing we found
on his ribs.

20:35.944 --> 20:37.309
[ Crackles ]

20:46.329 --> 20:49.696
The professor was cooking
with some serious fire
with these batteries.

20:49.791 --> 20:53.659
240 volts to the chest could
definitely be responsible
for Benji’s death,

20:53.753 --> 20:55.744
but was it enough to crack his ribs?

20:55.839 --> 20:58.581
Well, that’s what
we’re here to find out,
my brother from another mother.

20:58.675 --> 21:03.339
See, this ordnance gel has
been calibrated to absolutely
replicate human tissue,

21:03.430 --> 21:06.513
so we can see
if the ribs crack
when they’re electrocuted.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.385
You certainly love
yourjob, huh?

21:08.476 --> 21:10.091
See, I always get bored
so easily,

21:10.186 --> 21:12.393
which is why
I keep accumulating
all these degrees.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.562
Which explains your hope
that time travel exists,

21:14.649 --> 21:16.640
because that
would not be boring.

21:16.734 --> 21:21.353
Yeah, well,
I would not go back though.
I’d keep my past in the past.

21:21.448 --> 21:23.109
Ooh. It’s like
you’re hiding something.

21:23.199 --> 21:25.360
No, it’s just
what’s done is done.

21:25.452 --> 21:28.615
There’s so much more money
to be made in the future.

21:28.705 --> 21:31.572
I wouldn’t go that far forward.
Just, like, five years.

21:31.666 --> 21:35.409
Vernor Vinge’s theory of exponential
accelerating change, huh?

21:35.503 --> 21:40.247
Exactly. And that pretty much
guarantees some pretty sweet
technological advances.

21:40.341 --> 21:44.425
So, you would travel to the future,
steal their technology,

21:44.512 --> 21:48.505
then bring it back here
to the present
and make a fortune?

21:48.600 --> 21:51.216
Well, there’s no legal precedent
for time travel,

21:51.311 --> 21:53.643
so I wouldn’t exactly say
I was stealing.

21:53.730 --> 21:55.641
So, being that we are
evidence—based here,

21:55.732 --> 21:57.438
you should keep
that one to yourself.

21:57.567 --> 22:00.354
Okay. Ready?
Yeah.

22:01.696 --> 22:03.197
Zip up.

22:04.616 --> 22:07.323
Put these on.

22:07.410 --> 22:08.445
Thank you.

22:10.830 --> 22:14.493
Okay. Ready?

22:14.584 --> 22:16.040
Fire in the hole!

22:16.127 --> 22:18.413
Technically, it’s not a fire
until the amps make sure the—

22:24.177 --> 22:26.418
Maybe, uh, next time,
protective eyewear, I think?

22:26.554 --> 22:28.010
Yeah.
Yeah. Maybe?

22:28.097 --> 22:30.088
Fair enough.
[ Clears Throat]

22:33.937 --> 22:37.555
Wow. We just hit this guy
with enough current
to take down an elephant.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.976
Still no fracturing
of the ribs.
Yeah.

22:40.068 --> 22:43.026
Meaning that Benji
was not killed
by electrocution.

22:43.112 --> 22:47.446
Thought: Have you considered
hydrostatic shock?

22:48.785 --> 22:51.777
You’re talking about doing
another experiment, aren’t you?

22:51.871 --> 22:56.490
Perhaps I am your brother
from another mother.

22:56.584 --> 22:58.085
[ Chuckles ]

23:01.339 --> 23:03.796
So, the professor said
that there was a call...

23:03.883 --> 23:05.999
made to Benji’s cell phone
on Saturday night,

23:06.094 --> 23:09.712
and there was, but the caller
used a disposable cell.

23:09.806 --> 23:14.391
Benji was at the professor’s
place in Silver Spring
when he got the call.

23:14.477 --> 23:18.186
The FBI. said the victim borrowed cash
from Professor Hunter...

23:18.273 --> 23:21.231
and withdrew cash
from two A.T.M.’s.

23:21.317 --> 23:26.107
One here,
and the second here,

23:26.197 --> 23:27.983
farther outside the city.

23:28.074 --> 23:31.316
So, Benji was leaving town
and collecting money
as he went.

23:31.411 --> 23:34.027
The body was found here...

23:35.081 --> 23:36.582
in Brookmont.

23:37.750 --> 23:41.834
Why was Benji at an A.T.M.
up in North Bethesda?

23:43.673 --> 23:46.255
Cam, if time travel existed,

23:46.342 --> 23:49.505
and you could make one trip,
what would it be?

23:49.596 --> 23:53.009
You mean, like,
have tea with Jesus,

23:53.099 --> 23:54.714
or strangle Hitler in his crib?

23:54.809 --> 23:58.176
Or redo something
from your own life
when you were happiest.

24:02.817 --> 24:04.398
[ Chuckles ]
What is it?

24:04.485 --> 24:07.352
— I can’t.
— Oh, come on!

24:10.783 --> 24:13.160
Do you remember
your ex—husband?

24:13.244 --> 24:15.781
Oh, my God!
Birimbau?

24:15.872 --> 24:17.328
I’m so sorry.

24:17.457 --> 24:20.164
I would do
the same thing.
[ Both Chuckle ]

24:20.251 --> 24:23.038
The same guy, I mean.
Oh, my God.

24:23.129 --> 24:26.121
Would you tell
your significant other
the truth? Or would you—

24:26.215 --> 24:30.174
Oh, I would tell him
that I wanted to have
tea with Jesus.

24:34.182 --> 24:35.922
Hi.

24:37.935 --> 24:39.641
I ran a spectroscopic analysis...

24:39.729 --> 24:42.141
of the strawberry seeds
and soil found in the sole
of Benji’s shoe.

24:42.231 --> 24:45.143
— Could you—
— Yes, yes.

24:45.234 --> 24:48.317
Now, the shoe soil
is very deficient in calcium.

24:48.404 --> 24:51.441
But his body was found in soil
extremely rich in calcium.

24:51.532 --> 24:53.989
So, the body was moved
after he was killed?

24:54.077 --> 24:56.193
Yeah. He was killed
in serpentine soil.

24:56.287 --> 25:00.280
It’s very rare,
but there are some deposits
here in Rockville.

25:00.375 --> 25:03.367
That is a strawberry farm
near Rockville.

25:03.461 --> 25:04.792
Tell Booth.

25:04.879 --> 25:08.747
Cam, I actually came in here
to ask you for a gun.

25:11.636 --> 25:13.467
Okay.

25:15.431 --> 25:17.387
[ Hodgins ]
I wanted to shoot the gun.

25:17.475 --> 25:21.809
Well, I am the one
authorized to shoot the gun.
My only question is, why?

25:21.896 --> 25:25.809
The microfracturing in the victim’s ribs
did not occur due to electrical shock,

25:25.900 --> 25:29.063
but the waves in the gel
made me think
of hydrostatic shock.

25:29.153 --> 25:31.360
The high rate of speed
at which a bullet
enters the body...

25:31.447 --> 25:33.733
causes displacement in
the liquids surrounding it.

25:33.825 --> 25:37.488
So we believe that
if the victim was shot
just below the rib cage,

25:37.578 --> 25:40.490
this expansion
could have created
the microfracturing.

25:40.581 --> 25:42.082
Okay.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.545
[ Clicks ]

25:48.172 --> 25:50.128
— Fire in the hole!
- That’s my—

25:53.094 --> 25:55.085
That’s my line.

25:56.973 --> 26:00.136
— Ah. It worked.
— [ Saroyan ]
The victim was shot.

26:00.226 --> 26:01.887
Wow.

26:01.978 --> 26:04.185
It is good to have a physicist
in the house.

26:04.272 --> 26:07.810
- What?
- l— [ Murmurs]

26:26.836 --> 26:29.373
[ Brennan ] The house
is completely boarded up.

26:29.464 --> 26:32.331
Doesn’t look like
anyone’s lived here
for quite some time.

26:32.425 --> 26:34.006
Really? Why is there
a light on in the barn?

26:34.093 --> 26:36.049
All right, enough.
Can you keep that down?

26:36.137 --> 26:38.879
Oh, easy. Easy, easy.
[ Mutters ]

26:42.685 --> 26:45.051
Yeah. Looks like
someone broke in.

26:48.608 --> 26:52.021
Uh, looks like Benji’s truck.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.898
I think it’s more of a car,
to be honest with you.

26:56.616 --> 26:58.607
Booth?
Yeah.

27:03.790 --> 27:05.746
That’s a lot of blood
for one person.

27:05.833 --> 27:09.200
Benji may have also
been killed here.

27:09.295 --> 27:13.004
Rugged nuchal area on the cranium,
as well as the convoluted sutures...

27:13.090 --> 27:16.708
— suggest the victim
was a Hispanic male.
— Like Benji.

27:18.679 --> 27:21.136
Victim appears to have
suffered projectile trauma...

27:21.224 --> 27:23.556
to the inferior right thoracic region.

27:23.643 --> 27:25.179
Like Benji.

27:27.438 --> 27:29.724
Texturing of the
sternal rib ends...

27:29.816 --> 27:33.980
indicates an age
of mid—to—Iate 40s

27:34.070 --> 27:38.985
Bones, I mean,
you’re describing Benji,
but 20 years older.

27:48.334 --> 27:51.451
This victim suffered
a single gunshot wound...

27:51.587 --> 27:55.580
to the inferior
right thoracic region.
Huh.

27:55.675 --> 27:58.633
And judging
by the marbling
and skin slippage,

27:58.761 --> 28:02.970
I’d say he’s been dead
about six days.
Double huh.

28:03.057 --> 28:06.049
I’m sorry. Why the double huh,
Dr. Wells?

28:06.143 --> 28:10.933
Because I believe
that our two victims
may be the same person.

28:12.066 --> 28:14.352
— Excuse me?
- Quantum physics tells us...

28:14.443 --> 28:18.277
that out there somewhere
is a world 20 years ahead
of this one, right?

28:19.365 --> 28:20.650
Theoretically.

28:20.741 --> 28:22.652
Now, assuming that Benji...

28:22.743 --> 28:25.120
is a time traveler
from the future—

28:25.204 --> 28:27.741
— Big assumption.
— Big assumption.

28:27.874 --> 28:32.914
When he transports himself
back here, he changes the course
of his destiny in this time.

28:33.004 --> 28:35.541
So, when younger Benji gets shot,

28:35.631 --> 28:40.967
future Benji must then
take a bullet to satisfy
the variable of causality.

28:41.053 --> 28:45.422
Is this necessary?
You said that you believe
time travel is impossible.

28:45.516 --> 28:48.303
Just because something
is theoretically impossible...

28:48.394 --> 28:50.350
doesn’t mean that it’s not possible.

28:50.438 --> 28:52.429
I believe that is exactly
what it means.

28:52.523 --> 28:54.024
Well, of course you do,

28:54.108 --> 28:56.690
because your mind stops working
when it hears the word “impossible,”

28:56.777 --> 28:59.393
where mine just keeps
going and exploring.

28:59.488 --> 29:03.106
If you believe that the two
victims are the same person,
you don’t belong in this lab.

29:03.200 --> 29:05.361
Of course I don’t believe that.
That’s absurd.

29:05.453 --> 29:08.911
- Excellent. Moving on.
— But I do embrace...

29:08.998 --> 29:12.081
the impossible probability
as a reality.

29:12.168 --> 29:15.001
I mean, what serious
scientist wouldn’t?

29:16.589 --> 29:19.205
I found a contusion
on the frontal bone...

29:19.300 --> 29:22.087
roughly 20 millimeters
in diameter.

29:22.178 --> 29:25.716
Which suggests this man
was struck on the head
around time of death.

29:25.806 --> 29:29.924
Juster”.
our first victim.

29:30.019 --> 29:34.183
I believe that warrants
a triple huh.

29:37.318 --> 29:41.186
This guy, he’s a jackass.
Okay? He’s gonna be gone
when this case is over.

29:41.322 --> 29:43.438
Mmm. Maybe Dr. Wells
has a point though.
[ Sighs ]

29:43.532 --> 29:46.774
Just because we can’t
travel through time
right now...

29:46.869 --> 29:48.825
doesn’t mean
that we can’t do it
in the future.

29:48.913 --> 29:52.622
Okay, well, then why aren’t
these future—seeing people here,

29:52.708 --> 29:55.916
and they’re not
rewriting the past or betting
on football games then?

29:56.003 --> 29:59.291
I don’t have all the answers.
I’m just trying
to cast a wider net.

29:59.382 --> 30:01.293
Okay, well, here’s where
I’m casting mine.

30:01.384 --> 30:03.170
So, these guys, they met
at a remote place.

30:03.260 --> 30:04.921
There were burner cells
that were involved.

30:05.012 --> 30:07.549
There was cash
that we never found.

30:07.640 --> 30:10.302
Suggesting
an illegal transaction
that ends in death.

30:10.393 --> 30:13.135
But the only thing I don’t
understand is why the killer
took Benji’s body...

30:13.229 --> 30:14.719
and buried it in another farm.

30:14.814 --> 30:17.726
Well, clearly,
we need a wider net.

30:17.817 --> 30:19.307
Hmm.

30:19.402 --> 30:21.859
This guy Wells,
did he mention anything
about the asteroid mining?

30:21.946 --> 30:23.652
[Sighs]

30:23.739 --> 30:25.445
— What?
— Booth.
— [Cell Phone Rings]

30:25.533 --> 30:26.739
- I’m just curious.
- Really?

30:26.826 --> 30:29.693
- Yeah.
— Brennan.

30:29.912 --> 30:31.448
Sorry to interrupt
your lunch,

30:31.539 --> 30:34.531
but I found something
on the second victim’s
right patella.

30:34.625 --> 30:36.331
Oh, a comminuted fracture.

30:36.419 --> 30:38.910
Right. I-I placed the bone
under a microscope,

30:39.005 --> 30:43.499
and, at 40 times magnification,
I found evidence
of slight remodeling.

30:43.592 --> 30:47.050
So he was probably walking
or limping on this injury
for several days.

30:47.138 --> 30:50.050
That is a severe break.
The man must have been
in immense pain.

30:50.141 --> 30:53.633
Right. Yet, instead
of going to a hospital,
he was hanging out in a barn?

30:53.728 --> 30:57.266
See, I’m thinking,
he didn’t go to the hospital
because he couldn’t.

30:57.356 --> 31:01.645
He couldn’t jeopardize
anybody knowing that he was
from the future.

31:03.779 --> 31:06.521
Or perhaps there is
a more logical explanation.

31:06.615 --> 31:09.357
The victim suffered from
a minor case of scoliosis.

31:09.493 --> 31:11.984
Just like Benji.
Right.

31:12.079 --> 31:14.570
And scoliosis
is a hereditary disease,

31:14.665 --> 31:18.704
which suggests
that both victims
might be related.

31:18.794 --> 31:20.375
Sorry to disappoint you,
Dr. Wells.

31:20.463 --> 31:24.581
D.N.A. results confirm
that our second victim
is Benji’s father.

31:28.012 --> 31:29.502
Sounds reasonable.

31:35.978 --> 31:38.014
First you tell me
my little brother’s dead.

31:38.105 --> 31:40.346
Now you’re telling me
my father’s dead too?

31:40.441 --> 31:42.932
I’m sorry for your loss.

31:43.027 --> 31:46.235
Yeah. Thanks.

31:49.366 --> 31:50.902
I can’t believe this.

31:50.993 --> 31:55.862
You told Agent Booth
that your father left
when you and Benji were young.

31:55.956 --> 31:59.289
Are you aware
that, um, Benji’s been
in contact with your dad?

31:59.376 --> 32:00.991
No.

32:01.087 --> 32:03.453
Benji would have told me.

32:03.547 --> 32:05.208
It must have been
a one—time thing.

32:05.299 --> 32:07.130
How can you be
so sure of that?

32:07.218 --> 32:09.425
’Cause Benji thought
our dad was dead.

32:09.512 --> 32:11.594
Why would he think that?

32:11.680 --> 32:14.592
Benji was little when Felix left.

32:14.683 --> 32:18.141
Rather than tell him his dad
was a deadbeat junkie,

32:18.229 --> 32:20.936
Mom and I decided to tell him
that Felix was dead.

32:21.023 --> 32:24.140
- When was the last time
you saw your father?
— Years ago.

32:24.235 --> 32:25.725
And that was fine with me.

32:25.820 --> 32:28.186
Now, if your father
was still an addict,

32:28.280 --> 32:32.114
do you think that could
explain why he reached out
to Benji last Saturday night?

32:32.201 --> 32:33.941
Had to be.

32:34.036 --> 32:38.450
That son of a bitch
was probably in trouble
with one of his dealers.

32:38.541 --> 32:40.623
He needed Benji
to bail him out.

32:40.709 --> 32:43.200
[ Wei/s ]
The bullet
that entered Felix...

32:43.295 --> 32:45.206
nicked the sternal end
of the inferior 10th...

32:45.297 --> 32:48.755
and then went on to lodge itself
into the superior margin
of the 11th rib.

32:48.843 --> 32:50.959
There could be two shooters.

32:51.053 --> 32:53.544
Or the victims
were on the ground,

32:53.639 --> 32:56.472
and the killerjust stood
over them and shot.

32:56.559 --> 32:58.925
Which would also explain
the damage to both
of their skulls.

32:59.019 --> 33:01.396
This is a pretty easy
explanation. Sorry.

33:01.480 --> 33:04.142
I realize
that you might think
that I’m crazy...

33:04.233 --> 33:06.474
like Yoshiro Nakamatsu
or Tycho Brahe,

33:06.569 --> 33:09.686
but without them,
we wouldn’t have the laws
of planetary motion...

33:09.780 --> 33:11.281
or the simple taxi meter.

33:12.992 --> 33:16.655
It’s not “crazy” that
I’m worried about actually.
It’s arrogance.

33:16.745 --> 33:18.827
We’re a team here,
and you can be traded.

33:18.914 --> 33:22.372
Wherever I go,
I’m always the smartest person,
and it always creates problems.

33:22.459 --> 33:25.292
Well, maybe you should try
being less of a douche.

33:25.379 --> 33:28.291
Could you please rotate
both sets of remains...

33:28.382 --> 33:30.418
90 degrees to the left?

33:30.509 --> 33:33.251
Yes. But you can’t.

33:33.345 --> 33:38.089
Hmm. Well, you were wrong
about the skull damage.

33:38.184 --> 33:41.392
They were both hit
with the other’s head.

33:42.771 --> 33:44.227
Oh, my God.

33:44.315 --> 33:47.523
I really hate to say this,
but you are actually right.

33:47.610 --> 33:52.024
In this position, the trajectory
of both bullet wounds
now... lines up.

33:52.114 --> 33:54.571
It does. Perfect.

33:54.658 --> 33:55.909
Do I look humble?

33:56.869 --> 33:58.985
I’m trying to be
less of a douche.

Ford’s Theatre, 1865. Yep.

34:08.088 --> 34:11.125
But you said that
time travel was impossible.
It is impossible.

34:11.217 --> 34:14.380
I’m saying if it isn’t, okay?
Then like a movie or something.

34:14.470 --> 34:17.007
You’d... stop Lincoln
from being shot?

34:17.097 --> 34:19.383
Yeah, I would.
I mean, he deserved to...

34:19.475 --> 34:21.261
know that everything
turned out pretty well.

34:21.352 --> 34:24.389
I mean, I could do it.
Even if it meant that,
you know, I had to put...

34:24.480 --> 34:27.017
a bullet in, uh, Booth’s head.

34:27.107 --> 34:29.268
- But then you
might not have been—
— Yeah, I know, Bones.

34:29.360 --> 34:31.021
But it’s impossible.
All right, what about you?

34:31.111 --> 34:34.603
If you could
travel through time,
where would you go?

34:34.698 --> 34:37.940
— I’m already there. Here.
— What?

34:38.077 --> 34:39.283
Here.
Here?

34:39.370 --> 34:41.907
The difference
between past and future...

34:41.997 --> 34:44.864
is nowhere to be found
in the laws of physics.

34:44.959 --> 34:49.293
Everything I want
or need is here.

34:49.380 --> 34:50.870
Right now.

34:52.132 --> 34:54.293
Wow.
Right here?
Mm—hmm.

34:54.385 --> 34:56.421
Right now?

34:56.512 --> 34:58.753
[Cell Phone Rings]
[ Groans ]

35:00.057 --> 35:01.547
Booth.

35:03.185 --> 35:06.268
Right. Yeah, okay.
And you’re sure?

35:06.355 --> 35:08.220
Yeah, I—I—
I’ll be right down.

35:08.357 --> 35:10.313
[Beeps]
Looks like we got
Felix Garcia’s drug dealer.

35:10.401 --> 35:13.268
According to Alex, the father
had been using for years.

35:13.362 --> 35:15.398
He must’ve had
multiple dealers.

35:15.489 --> 35:17.775
Yeah, but here’s
the kicker, okay?

35:17.866 --> 35:21.450
The dealer also works
at Alex’s body shop.

35:21.537 --> 35:23.778
So he has a connection
to both victims.

35:23.872 --> 35:27.706
Must not be a very good dealer
if he has to work a second job.

35:27.793 --> 35:31.206
Yeah, well, killing your customer?
That’s bad for business too.

35:38.637 --> 35:40.673
[ Booth ]
So how long have you been
dealing heroin, Sidney?

35:40.764 --> 35:44.632
I don’t do that.
I got busted in 2009.
I got off with probation.

35:44.727 --> 35:46.467
I took it as a sign,
and I retired.

35:46.562 --> 35:48.803
Right. You know what this is?

35:48.897 --> 35:52.139
— Looks like a tactical baton.
— Found it in the trunk of your car.

35:52.234 --> 35:54.475
I don’t know, man.
I go to some pretty sketchy
neighborhoods.

35:54.570 --> 35:56.856
— You use it recently?
— Nope.

35:56.947 --> 36:00.110
- Maybe on the kneecap
of a Felix Garcia?
- Nope.

36:00.200 --> 36:02.577
— Do you even know
a Felix Garcia?
— No.

36:02.661 --> 36:04.162
No? Okay.
Let me fill you in.

36:04.246 --> 36:07.283
He owed you money for heroin.
He didn’t pay you,
so what do you do?

36:07.374 --> 36:10.207
You whacked him
in the kneecap with this.

36:10.294 --> 36:14.958
He ran and he hid, and he got
his son Benji to pay you off,
but you shot them both.

36:15.049 --> 36:17.085
[ Inhales]
No.

36:17.176 --> 36:18.962
— Which part?
— No.

36:19.053 --> 36:22.591
— You have an alibi
for last Saturday night?
— Mmm, no.

36:22.681 --> 36:24.387
You’re gonna need a lawyer, pal.

36:24.475 --> 36:28.468
Why do I need a lawyer?
I think I’m doing
pretty great on my own.

36:28.562 --> 36:32.646
The two striations on Felix’s knee
are one millimeter apart,

36:32.733 --> 36:37.318
and they correspond precisely
with the millimeter-sized divot
at the end of Jouron’s baton.

36:37.404 --> 36:42.819
But if we hope to convict him,
we need to tie his baton
to perimortem damage.

36:44.453 --> 36:48.321
Benji Garcia sustained
this other injury at
or very near time of death.

36:48.415 --> 36:51.452
Can you tie this
to his baton as well?

36:53.921 --> 36:56.333
What are your thoughts
on asteroid mining, Dr. Wells?

36:57.716 --> 37:00.583
Well, uh, it’ll definitely happen.

37:00.677 --> 37:04.215
Robotic technologies have
advanced to the point where
they can be self-repairing,

37:04.306 --> 37:07.514
and near—Earth asteroids
like 4660 Nereus...

37:07.601 --> 37:11.185
are practical candidates for
strip and magnetic extraction.

37:11.271 --> 37:14.399
Financially speaking,
the key is to invest early.

37:14.483 --> 37:17.941
If my minor in economics
is worth anything, yes.

37:18.028 --> 37:19.734
No striations.

37:19.822 --> 37:22.359
The baton was not used
to inflict this damage.

37:22.449 --> 37:24.155
So we’re looking
for another weapon.

37:24.243 --> 37:26.985
Look at the compression
and the bending
around the breaks.

37:27.121 --> 37:31.831
What kind of weapon could come
down with this kind of force
at a 45—degree angle?

37:33.585 --> 37:37.077
— So Jouron busted
Felix’s kneecap.
— Days before either murder.

37:37.172 --> 37:39.458
So tell me again
why you want to talk
to Alex Garcia.

37:39.550 --> 37:42.462
When I asked him
when he last saw his father,
he stood up.

37:42.594 --> 37:45.757
That means something.
Yeah, it means he’s got
a cramp in his leg.

37:45.848 --> 37:48.931
Or it means he was
fleeing the question,
symbolically.

37:49.017 --> 37:50.632
If so,
he’s hiding something.

37:50.727 --> 37:53.264
Mr. Garcia,

37:53.355 --> 37:58.520
we got a warrant here
to look through
Sidney Jouron’s locker.

37:58.652 --> 38:00.984
Were you aware
that he deals drugs?
He used to.

38:01.071 --> 38:03.733
I gave him a job here
as part of his early release.

38:05.784 --> 38:08.651
I’ll open his locker
for you.

38:08.745 --> 38:11.578
— Uh, so, I’ve been thinking
about you and your father.
— [ Grunts ]

38:11.665 --> 38:13.951
Okay, that cannot be
a coincidence.

38:14.042 --> 38:15.748
There’s something going on
with his dad.

38:15.836 --> 38:17.872
I haven’t seen my dad
in years.

38:19.756 --> 38:24.216
These doors here,
at what angle do they—they
come down on?

38:25.512 --> 38:27.844
- Forty-five degrees. Why?
— Forty—five degrees.

38:27.931 --> 38:30.047
— Forty—five degrees.
- What’s that gotta do
with my dad?

38:30.142 --> 38:33.475
— You slammed your brother’s leg
in the car door, didn’t you?
- After he was dead.

38:33.562 --> 38:36.975
You’re saying I killed him?
I loved my brother.
Why would I do that?

38:37.065 --> 38:39.192
We’re gonna find
traces of blood in this seat,
aren’t we, Alex?

38:39.318 --> 38:42.936
I can see it all happen.
Your dad got his drugs from Sidney.
He didn’t pay his debts.

38:43.030 --> 38:46.397
Sid busts up his leg,
so he comes to you two guys
for help.

38:46.492 --> 38:50.030
Benji thought your dad
was dead, so, unlike you,
he was thrilled to see him.

38:50.120 --> 38:52.987
Benji was gonna give your dad
the money, so you followed him
to the barn.

38:53.081 --> 38:55.868
— You didn’t want to shoot Benji,
but he stepped in the way.
— To protect his father.

38:55.959 --> 39:00.919
He was gonna give
the old man his college money.
I couldn’t let him do that.

39:05.719 --> 39:07.710
I never meant for him—

39:09.806 --> 39:14.971
All he ever wanted
was to go back in time
and to meet his old man.

39:21.401 --> 39:24.188
He got his wish.

39:24.279 --> 39:26.656
And look what happened.

39:38.627 --> 39:40.959
[Brennan’s I/0/ce On Computer]
The extensive amount of
fracture lines are indicative...

39:41.046 --> 39:43.708
of a weapon
With a circular cross-section.

39:43.799 --> 39:46.586
Hey. Usually when
we catch a bad guy,
we go home.

39:46.677 --> 39:50.841
Oh, yeah, I’m just trying
to commit to memory everything
that I learned from Dr. Brennan.

39:50.931 --> 39:53.718
Uh, take my advice.
Get a notebook.

39:53.809 --> 39:55.970
Oh, it’s okay.
I have a photographic memory.

39:56.061 --> 39:58.723
Okay.
[ Chuckles ]
Good night.

39:58.814 --> 40:00.805
See you.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.777
We caught the murderer, Dr. Wells.
You can go home.

40:07.864 --> 40:09.729
Yeah, see,

40:09.825 --> 40:13.113
I’m just a little concerned
that we may have caught him
because of good luck.

40:13.203 --> 40:15.364
There’s no such thing
as good luck.

40:15.455 --> 40:20.324
Well, as I understand it,
if Agent Booth hadn’t
brought Dr. Sweets along...

40:20.419 --> 40:23.001
and they hadn’t seen Alex Garcia
get clunked on the head,

40:23.088 --> 40:24.703
then we never would’ve
caught the guy.

40:24.798 --> 40:26.538
That’s not luck.
That’s teamwork.

40:26.633 --> 40:29.750
It’s the fact that you
don’t believe in luck that
doesn’t let you see the role...

40:29.845 --> 40:31.301
that it played
in this investigation.

40:31.388 --> 40:34.425
Nonsense. We’ve been
working together a long time.

40:34.516 --> 40:39.510
And since you have a degree
in complicated systems
and imaginary numbers,

40:39.605 --> 40:44.599
you know that what appears
to be synchronicity— luck—

40:44.693 --> 40:48.902
is nothing more
than a sophisticated array
of cause and effect.

40:48.989 --> 40:50.854
I, uh—

40:50.949 --> 40:53.691
I don’t have a degree
in complicated systems.

40:53.785 --> 40:56.322
Oh, well, we all have
our areas of weakness.

40:58.248 --> 41:00.660
Good night, Dr. Wells.

41:00.751 --> 41:03.208
Are you— Are you saying
that I’m lacking?

41:20.395 --> 41:22.101
[ Booth ]
That’s funny.
[ Chuckles ]

41:22.189 --> 41:24.475
Well, I didn’t tell you that
to make you laugh.

41:24.566 --> 41:27.899
- Well. [Chuckles]
— I confess that in
a moment of weakness,

41:27.986 --> 41:32.025
I took the opportunity
to make Dr. Wells feel bad
about himself.

41:32.115 --> 41:33.776
He deserves it. Trust me.

41:33.867 --> 41:36.609
It’s probably the first time
he’s met someone
that’s smarter than him.

41:36.745 --> 41:39.612
You’re referring
to me?
Yes.

41:39.748 --> 41:42.831
I have another
confession.
Mmm.

41:42.918 --> 41:45.455
It’s possible that...

41:45.545 --> 41:47.206
I’m not smarter
than he is.

41:47.297 --> 41:48.673
[ Clears Throat]
Really?

41:48.757 --> 41:52.124
He saw the merit
in your get—rich scheme
before I did.

41:52.260 --> 41:54.342
Ah, the asteroid mining.
Yes.

41:54.429 --> 41:56.340
- Yes!
— I invested $10,000.

41:56.431 --> 42:00.674
Yeah, but wait a second.
I didn’t put any money
into that at all.

42:00.769 --> 42:03.852
— Why not?
— Because you’re
the smarter one.

42:03.939 --> 42:06.726
I’m going to point out
that if I’d trusted you
from the beginning,

42:06.817 --> 42:10.401
I would’ve invested in
the asteroids and I would’ve
been ahead of Dr. Wells.

42:11.321 --> 42:13.403
Right, so—
[ Clears Throat]

42:13.490 --> 42:17.108
logically speaking,
that makes me
the smarter one.

42:20.163 --> 42:22.074
No argument there?

42:23.834 --> 42:27.201
I’m thinking.
Uh—huh. I hear nothing
but asteroids.

43:01.663 --> 43:03.028
What’s that mean?
