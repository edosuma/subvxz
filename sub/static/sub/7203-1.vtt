As you can see,
that never happened.

41:35.493 --> 41:39.464
I talked to Ted
and he said if
we clean the place out,

41:39.531 --> 41:40.732
we could make it
our own dojo.

41:40.799 --> 41:43.268

the utilities, no rent.

41:43.334 --> 41:45.170
What do you guys think?

41:45.236 --> 41:46.572
I think we got a lot
of work to do.

41:50.208 --> 41:52.644
It's fucking perfect.
What?

41:52.711 --> 41:54.445
While you guys
finish cleaning up,

41:54.512 --> 41:56.047
I'm gonna go make sure
Case doesn't leave town.

41:57.248 --> 41:58.584

41:58.650 --> 42:00.318
How to get some equipment
at a real bargain.

Oh, hey, not now.

42:01.853 --> 42:02.854

of hours, all right?

42:11.763 --> 42:12.864

something I heard.

you're talking about.

42:17.569 --> 42:19.871

It's what they do.

42:19.938 --> 42:21.873
I didn't know it was
some big secret.

42:21.940 --> 42:23.775
Okay, can we talk
about something

42:23.842 --> 42:26.111
other than my father's
sexual orientation?

42:27.212 --> 42:29.848
Well, it's not like
you're gay, right?

42:29.915 --> 42:33.985
I mean, like, homosexuality
isn't, like, hereditary.

42:34.052 --> 42:37.355
It's not like a disease.
And no, I'm not gay.

42:39.090 --> 42:40.391
How do you know?

42:41.960 --> 42:44.462
How many girls
have you slept with?

42:44.529 --> 42:46.665
I don't know.

you curse yourself to
a life of bad lovers.

43:20.565 --> 43:21.867
Okay, I got an idea.

43:21.933 --> 43:24.069
I'm gonna write
my guess on this table.

shit come from?

44:10.281 --> 44:13.852
Let's just say
it was liberated from
a certain boxing gym.

44:13.919 --> 44:16.755
I thought the idea was
to keep Case out of jail.

44:16.822 --> 44:19.725
Believe me,
Frankie is never gonna
report this stuff stolen.

44:19.791 --> 44:21.226
Yeah? How can
you be so sure?

he stole it from.

even half of it.
