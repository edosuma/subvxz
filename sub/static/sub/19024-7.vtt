00:01.400 --> 00:03.755
As a doctor, you learn
to use anything you can

00:03.840 --> 00:06.035
to keep a patient
from getting hurt again.

00:06.120 --> 00:08.156
So, Mike, before we
get you out of here,

00:08.240 --> 00:10.959
I think it's important we go
over this one more time.

00:11.040 --> 00:13.235
Even their own home video.

00:13.320 --> 00:15.880
See, right about here
is where you get hurt.

00:17.520 --> 00:19.431
See, here you're not hurt.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.909
And then.. Oh, good God!

00:22.000 --> 00:23.831
Hurt again.

00:23.920 --> 00:26.388
Not hurt... hurt.

00:26.480 --> 00:29.995
Baritone. Soprano.

00:30.080 --> 00:32.116
Married with two kids.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.031
- Dying old...
- Look, I get it, OK?

00:34.120 --> 00:37.157
OK. OK, Mike.
That's all that matters.

00:38.880 --> 00:41.440
Victor. Victoria.

00:41.520 --> 00:44.034
I mean, the kid thinks
he's Evil Knievel.

00:44.120 --> 00:47.271
Gosh, I'd love to attend
your safety camp this summer,

00:47.360 --> 00:50.557
I would, but my parents are making me
go to Maine with them.

00:50.640 --> 00:52.596
Make sure you take
a lot of pictures.

00:52.680 --> 00:54.477
When you get back,
we can sit down

00:54.560 --> 00:56.915
and make our "friends forever" collage.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.911
Come on, now.
The kid's 1 6 years old.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.309
He's a little busted up.
It's not a big deal.

01:01.400 --> 01:03.118
I mean, hell,
when you were a kid,

01:03.200 --> 01:05.589
you must have cut your hand
on your dollhouse.

01:05.680 --> 01:08.797
Oh, please. I lived for danger.

01:08.880 --> 01:12.395
Who's ready for some Frisbee?

01:12.480 --> 01:14.630
Get my mom! Get my mom!

01:14.720 --> 01:17.792
I had four different helmets.

01:17.880 --> 01:20.519
I don't have time right
now to be the 1 00-watt bulb

01:20.600 --> 01:23.592
for your annoying little moth,
so if you could fly away,

01:23.680 --> 01:26.911
that'd be great,
just fly...

01:28.320 --> 01:30.390
I usually don't walk away
from Dr Cox,

01:30.480 --> 01:32.675
but today
the pharmaceutical reps show up

01:32.760 --> 01:34.352
to peddle their new drugs,

01:34.440 --> 01:37.238
and at Sacred Heart
that means one thing.

01:37.320 --> 01:38.878
Julie's here.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:11.080 --> 02:12.433
Damn.

02:12.520 --> 02:13.919
Damn.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.752
Damn.

02:15.840 --> 02:18.308
- What? She's hot.
- No, that's hot.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.470
Baby, you know
that fantasy I have

02:20.560 --> 02:22.755
of you, me, and a player
to be named later?

02:22.840 --> 02:26.594
Yeah, I'm fine. If it was
someone like her, I'd go for it.

02:26.680 --> 02:30.719
You are the best thing
that has ever happened to me.

02:30.800 --> 02:32.995
- I can't believe you said that.
- What?

02:33.080 --> 02:35.719
It's not like he's gonna
do anything about it.

02:35.800 --> 02:39.315
I was wondering if there was
any way that we could possibly...

02:39.400 --> 02:42.153
- Oh, hi.
- Hey, baby.

02:42.240 --> 02:46.313
Yeah, you can't ever
give a guy that window.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.995
Even though she was
way out of my league,

03:12.080 --> 03:16.676
I decided to show some guts
and lay down the smoothest rap I knew.

03:18.280 --> 03:20.350
Hi, handsome. I'm Julie.

03:20.440 --> 03:26.072
Were you named
after a precious jewel...ie?

03:26.160 --> 03:29.948
You are cute.
Would you like a pen?

03:30.040 --> 03:33.828
No. I'd love one.

03:33.920 --> 03:36.559
Well, go ahead, take it.

03:36.640 --> 03:39.950
Steady. Easy now.

03:40.040 --> 03:42.634
You're almost there.

03:42.720 --> 03:44.836
That's a bad Newbie.

03:44.920 --> 03:48.276
My God, you'd be more subtle
if you stood naked in the hallway

03:48.360 --> 03:50.555
eating a ten-inch kielbasa.

03:50.640 --> 03:52.471
That hurts, Perry.

03:52.560 --> 03:54.630
- Let's go.
- But I gotta say,

03:54.720 --> 03:57.154
I don't mind watching
you two boys walk away.

03:57.240 --> 04:00.391
Oh yeah! Work it.

04:00.480 --> 04:03.677
She means our tushies.
We go back, but walk backwards.

04:03.760 --> 04:07.230
There is no one I hate
more than that Medusa.

04:07.320 --> 04:11.074
Even knowing she's here makes me
want to tear someone's head off.

04:11.160 --> 04:13.993
Is this a good time?
I have a teeny-weeny question

04:14.080 --> 04:16.274
about Mrs Kahn's
necrotizing fasciitis.

04:16.360 --> 04:18.749
- For you, Barbie, anything.
- Super.

04:18.839 --> 04:20.671
First, an interesting side note.

04:20.760 --> 04:23.991
I had my physical last week,
and while my cholesterol was low,

04:24.080 --> 04:26.389
my blood pressure
was through the roof.

04:26.480 --> 04:28.789
Needless to say,
my physician was stumped.

04:28.880 --> 04:32.270
But now, thank God,
you've helped to solve that riddle,

04:32.360 --> 04:34.874
because the instant
I heard your shrill voice

04:34.960 --> 04:37.349
whining about
a "teeny-weeny problem."

04:37.440 --> 04:39.795
it took every ounce
of self-restraint I had

04:39.880 --> 04:42.678
to keep blood
from shooting out my ears.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.557
In the time
it took you to say that,

04:44.640 --> 04:46.278
you could have just
helped me.

04:46.360 --> 04:50.911
Well, yes, it does, but here,
that's what makes it delicious.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.515
What? I am not gonna say a word.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.955
- You just did.
- Except that, and that.

04:57.040 --> 04:59.031
And that and that and that.

04:59.120 --> 05:01.236
It just keeps on going.

05:04.280 --> 05:06.840
Hey, cutie. What's your name?

05:06.920 --> 05:10.071
I'm Carla, your girlfriend,
and as much as I usually love it,

05:10.160 --> 05:14.756
I really don't have time
to pretend we never met, OK?

05:14.840 --> 05:17.070
Carla's a pretty name.

05:17.160 --> 05:20.311
You know I'd play, sweetie,
but because I'm just a nurse,

05:20.400 --> 05:23.437
I have to go get Dr Wilder's
permission to give his patient

05:23.520 --> 05:25.590
some food even though
I know it's fine.

05:25.680 --> 05:29.355
Speaking of things
that are perfectly fine...

05:29.440 --> 05:32.238
That was a compliment.
Why won't any women talk to me?

05:32.320 --> 05:35.596
You're slimy and turn everything
into a double entendre.

05:35.680 --> 05:37.591
Not true.

05:40.640 --> 05:41.629
Go ahead.

05:41.720 --> 05:44.678
I'd like to double her entendre.

05:44.760 --> 05:46.193
Please?

05:50.480 --> 05:52.152
He's leaving.

05:52.240 --> 05:54.959
This is officially
the greatest day ever.

05:55.040 --> 05:56.632
T aking off?

05:56.720 --> 06:00.110
- Yeah. If that's OK.
- That's fine.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.430
I just wanted
to sneak out for an hour

06:02.520 --> 06:05.398
and see my kid's fourth-grade play,
but you caught me.

06:05.480 --> 06:07.835
- No. No catchies.
- No, I think you're right.

06:07.920 --> 06:10.673
Before I do anything,
I'll run it by you first.

06:10.760 --> 06:12.796
Permission to go see
my kid's attempt

06:12.880 --> 06:14.711
to overcome
his crippling shyness

06:14.800 --> 06:16.916
by appearing
in his class's production

06:17.000 --> 06:20.117
- of Town without a Turkey?
- I gotta get back to work.

06:20.200 --> 06:24.239
Back to work. Message received.

06:24.320 --> 06:26.959
What just happened?

06:27.040 --> 06:29.395
I can't figure out
what to do about Mrs Kahn.

06:29.480 --> 06:31.789
I don't know if I should
send her to surgery.

06:31.880 --> 06:34.075
Well, don't send her to surgery.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.390
I'll tell you what you do,
you wait and see.

06:36.480 --> 06:39.677
I know I'm right because
I'm a wait-and-see kind of guy.

06:39.760 --> 06:41.796
You know, Elliot,
in modern medicine,

06:41.880 --> 06:44.235
we're often faced
with tough decisions.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.436
- You are amazing.
- Well...

06:46.520 --> 06:48.397
"Amazing" is sort of
a strong word.

06:48.480 --> 06:51.040
I just show up and let the Lord
work through me.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.839
You think you're a better doctor
than me, don't you?

06:53.920 --> 06:56.115
Well, I do have
better bedside manner.

06:56.200 --> 06:58.714
I anticipate problems
way ahead of time.

06:58.800 --> 07:01.997
Oh, and my hair never gets
in my face. So, yes, yes, I do.

07:02.080 --> 07:04.071
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

07:04.160 --> 07:06.833
Every time you stare off
into space like this...

07:06.920 --> 07:09.878
you're thinking of something
you're too afraid to say.

07:09.960 --> 07:12.758
Please, I never do this.

07:12.840 --> 07:15.434
Maybe she's upset
because she knows I'm right.

07:15.520 --> 07:17.750
Oh, my God.

07:20.800 --> 07:24.713
Dr Cox, I hate to bring it up again,
but it seems important.

07:24.800 --> 07:27.268
Julie likes our tushies.

07:27.360 --> 07:29.954
Newbie, any doctor with
a shred of self-respect

07:30.040 --> 07:32.713
wouldn't give that woman
the time of day.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.553
- Oh, Julie.
- Well, well.

07:35.640 --> 07:38.359
If it isn't the Captain
& Tenille of the underworld.

07:38.440 --> 07:40.317
- Hi, boys.
- Hi, Julie.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.038
Perry, do you know the name

07:42.120 --> 07:45.396
of the new anti-arrhythmic drug
that Julie is selling?

07:45.480 --> 07:48.199
- That's a tough one.
- It's Plomox.

07:48.280 --> 07:51.078
Nice work, Nancy Drew.
Now see if you can solve the one

07:51.160 --> 07:53.230
about the missing lD badge.

07:53.320 --> 07:56.039
Plomox is the most effective
anti-arrhythmic drug

07:56.120 --> 07:58.554
on the market,
and it has minimal side effects,

07:58.640 --> 08:00.915
only nausea, impotence,
and anal leakage.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.719
I'm getting two out of three
from the conversation.

08:03.800 --> 08:06.633
You kids can talk more
over the pharmaceutical dinner

08:06.720 --> 08:08.790
that you're helping her
put together.

08:08.880 --> 08:12.475
- Don't do this to me, Bob.
- Do it to him, Bob.

08:12.560 --> 08:15.028
Perry, we're going to need
a big staff turnout,

08:15.120 --> 08:16.917
so don't take "no"
for an answer.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.752
- You going there, chief?
- No.

08:18.840 --> 08:21.593
If I wanted to make
small talk over low-grade beef,

08:21.680 --> 08:23.989
I'd have dinner at home.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.750
I'm just increasing
your Lidocaine drip

08:31.840 --> 08:34.149
just a little bit, OK,
Mr Brooks?

08:34.240 --> 08:37.596
- Hey, Carla, you got a second?
- No, actually, I'm swamped.

08:37.679 --> 08:39.591
I got a present for you.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.192
Why would you get me a present?

08:43.280 --> 08:45.748
Why does it need to be
a birthday or anniversary

08:45.840 --> 08:48.559
for me to get my baby
a little something-something?

08:48.640 --> 08:50.596
Plus you figured
you'd get yourself

08:50.680 --> 08:52.989
a little at-work
something-something.

08:53.080 --> 08:55.071
I'll get the door.

08:57.360 --> 09:01.148
Wow. A bus pass.

09:01.240 --> 09:04.152
- Help me get off my bra.
- That's not all.

09:04.240 --> 09:07.232
You'll use that bus pass
for an all-expense paid trip

09:07.320 --> 09:09.117
to nurse practitioners' school,

09:09.200 --> 09:11.873
where you'll learn how to be
more than just a nurse.

09:11.960 --> 09:14.599
- "Just a nurse?"
- Did I say "just a nurse?"

09:14.680 --> 09:16.352
I meant a nurse.

09:16.440 --> 09:18.715
You were complaining
about having to ask

09:18.800 --> 09:20.597
for permission
to feed a patient.

09:20.680 --> 09:23.399
You'll have more responsibility,
make more money,

09:23.480 --> 09:25.869
- so I thought...
- You thought the only reason

09:25.960 --> 09:28.155
I've done my job
for the last eight years

09:28.240 --> 09:31.152
is because nobody came along
to hand me a brochure?

09:31.240 --> 09:34.471
And a bus pass.

09:34.560 --> 09:36.994
You're unbelievable.

09:39.560 --> 09:41.357
Damn.

09:41.440 --> 09:45.353
Dude, I am just as disappointed
as you are.

09:48.400 --> 09:51.198
JD, even though I decided
to send Mrs Kahn to surgery,

09:51.280 --> 09:53.953
I know you were trying
to help me in your own way.

09:54.040 --> 09:58.352
I overreacted. That's something I'm
working on in therapy to not do as much.

09:58.440 --> 10:00.431
I still think
you should have gone with

10:00.520 --> 10:04.069
- my wait-and-see approach.
- You're not the boss of me!

10:06.320 --> 10:08.231
I'm not the boss of anyone.

10:08.320 --> 10:10.072
Permission to use the can, boss?

10:10.160 --> 10:12.310
Enough already.
I'm not doing this.

10:16.080 --> 10:17.877
Fine. Permission granted.

10:24.640 --> 10:28.110
So, Mr Brooks
is doing peachy, huh?

10:28.200 --> 10:31.033
- Peachy keen.
- Great.

10:31.120 --> 10:34.157
A patient's improvement
is always cause for celebration

10:34.240 --> 10:37.118
here at Sacred Heart,
and yet, for some reason,

10:37.200 --> 10:39.031
I'm not wearing a party hat,

10:39.120 --> 10:42.590
sitting bare-ass on
the hospital's copier machine.

10:42.680 --> 10:45.399
You know why? It's not
because I have the name

10:45.480 --> 10:48.438
"Johnny" tattooed on my butt.
He's an old sailor buddy

10:48.520 --> 10:51.432
and if you went through
what we did, you'd understand.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.909
It's because somebody went ahead

10:54.000 --> 10:56.434
and increased Mr Brooks's
Lidocaine drip,

10:56.520 --> 10:59.557
and by law
that could only be a doctor.

11:00.520 --> 11:04.069
Are you a doctor,
Nurse Espinoza?

11:05.120 --> 11:06.712
Well?

11:06.800 --> 11:10.076
- No, sir.
- You're damn right you're not.

11:12.480 --> 11:16.359
So how's the guest list for tonight's
steak dinner shaping up?

11:16.440 --> 11:20.228
Well, now, I don't have
any definitive confirmations yet,

11:20.320 --> 11:23.551
but admittedly that could be
because I haven't asked anyone.

11:25.720 --> 11:28.518
Why does it have to be like this
every time I come here?

11:28.600 --> 11:30.636
I mean, what is
your problem with me?

11:30.720 --> 11:32.790
OK, well,

11:32.880 --> 11:36.031
for starters, everyone here
knows that you sell pills,

11:36.120 --> 11:38.793
and yet you use phrases
like "take orally"

11:38.880 --> 11:42.236
and "increases blood flow"
way, way too much.

11:42.320 --> 11:45.756
I mean, jeepers, Julie, you have
half the doctors on this staff

11:45.840 --> 11:47.910
believing that if they
join Team Plomox

11:48.000 --> 11:50.798
that they get an outside shot
of you showing them

11:50.880 --> 11:52.757
the cotton inside your bottle.

11:52.840 --> 11:57.152
Would you like to know
the real dirty, dirty little secret?

11:57.240 --> 12:00.073
It's that your drug is so good
that you guys went ahead

12:00.160 --> 12:02.435
and put about
a 600% mark-up on it.

12:02.520 --> 12:05.557
But the only ones who get
hurt are the sick people, right?

12:05.640 --> 12:07.949
Since your company
doesn't care about them

12:08.040 --> 12:11.396
and you're part of the system,
that means you don't care either.

12:11.480 --> 12:14.233
That's what's making me sick.
That's all.

12:14.320 --> 12:17.198
Well, you can say
what you want, Perry,

12:17.280 --> 12:19.669
but we both know
that you'd love nothing more

12:19.760 --> 12:22.832
than to smack this fine ass.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.672
Perry.

12:25.760 --> 12:27.591
Harder, Perry.

12:28.960 --> 12:31.633
Don't stop, Perry.

12:31.720 --> 12:35.918
Oh, Perry,
that feels good.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.360
So you promise me you're gonna
be more careful?

12:42.440 --> 12:45.193
Dude, the only way to feel
alive is to push the limits

12:45.280 --> 12:48.078
- once in a while, you know?
- Well, keep it real.

12:48.160 --> 12:52.073
God. See ya, geek.

12:52.160 --> 12:54.071
Buy a cup!

12:58.160 --> 13:00.515
What's wrong?

13:00.600 --> 13:02.795
Mrs Kahn died
on the operating table.

13:05.600 --> 13:08.512
A lot of things
can take you by surprise.

13:13.080 --> 13:17.232
Sometimes it's just realizing that
you're not as happy as you thought.

13:21.160 --> 13:24.311
Sometimes it's a hot chick
smacking her tushie.

13:29.000 --> 13:34.199
And sometimes it's when
you take a chance... and lose.

13:34.280 --> 13:37.397
This just sucks, you know?

13:37.480 --> 13:41.678
This is a crucial moment.
Pick your words carefully.

13:41.760 --> 13:43.830
I guess I was right after all.

13:49.800 --> 13:51.711
Stupid.

13:56.040 --> 13:59.794
I had to talk to Elliot before the
morbidity and mortality conference,

13:59.880 --> 14:01.552
Nothing puts you
in a worse mood

14:01.640 --> 14:04.029
than having to explain
why your patient died.

14:04.120 --> 14:05.712
I just need to talk to her

14:05.800 --> 14:08.792
when there 's no possible way
that she can interrupt me.

14:08.880 --> 14:12.395
Peanut-butter cracker!
Go! Go! Go!

14:12.480 --> 14:15.392
What I said earlier came
out completely the wrong way

14:15.480 --> 14:17.550
and I just want you to know
that I act...

14:17.640 --> 14:19.756
Bite me.

14:19.840 --> 14:23.913
Oh, she's a crafty lass.

14:24.000 --> 14:27.197
Baby, I know you had a rough day,
and I was part of it.

14:27.280 --> 14:31.910
I thought I'd make it up to you
by taking you out to a nice dinner.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.560
Which waitress
do you think will do me?

14:34.640 --> 14:37.473
I'd say you got a shot
with the busboy over there.

14:37.560 --> 14:39.755
You realize
this doesn't count, right?

14:39.840 --> 14:43.958
Yeah, but, baby... Free steak.

14:45.200 --> 14:48.590
You just flat out
get women, don't you?

14:48.680 --> 14:51.831
- This is kind of romantic, right?
- Check it out.

14:51.920 --> 14:54.593
It's a meat cookie.

14:54.680 --> 14:56.238
Oh, God!

14:56.320 --> 14:59.073
Hello, boys and girl.
So, how's the food?

14:59.960 --> 15:01.188
Free.

15:01.280 --> 15:03.316
And how are you, Dr Cox?

15:03.400 --> 15:05.231
I'm just here to enjoy my meal,

15:05.320 --> 15:08.995
so unless those things dispense
A1 Sauce, I'd keep moving.

15:09.080 --> 15:12.755
That is so, so funny.
You know what else is funny?

15:12.840 --> 15:15.229
How you claim you want
nothing to do with me,

15:15.320 --> 15:17.754
yet every time I turn around,
there you are.

15:19.360 --> 15:21.112
I wonder why that is?

15:22.360 --> 15:25.511
Oh, that feels good.

15:29.200 --> 15:35.639
Finally, we have Dr Reid's
necrotizing fasciitis case.

15:35.720 --> 15:40.350
Deceased. Now, don't be frightened,
sweetheart. No one's on trial here.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.671
At least not until the family
sues your little behind.

15:45.360 --> 15:47.396
Sweetie, I'm not joking.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.631
But should that happen,
you may rest assured

15:50.720 --> 15:53.518
that the hospital
will stand behind you 1 00 per cent.

15:53.600 --> 15:57.195
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Now, see, there I was joking.

15:57.280 --> 15:58.998
Try to keep up.

15:59.080 --> 16:00.991
Oh, God, this is painful.

16:01.080 --> 16:03.719
It's like watching a shark
circle a baby harp seal.

16:03.800 --> 16:06.598
Dr Reid faced
a very difficult decision

16:06.680 --> 16:11.037
and she chose
an extremely risky course.

16:11.120 --> 16:14.112
He's like a royal python
torturing a hopper mouse.

16:14.200 --> 16:16.031
Man, I love Animal Planet.

16:16.120 --> 16:19.556
I believe we all have a lesson
to learn from Dr Reid's case.

16:19.640 --> 16:21.710
And here comes
the crushing blow.

16:21.800 --> 16:25.315
I say...kudos to Dr Reid.

16:25.400 --> 16:27.550
What-os to who?

16:27.640 --> 16:31.997
Without surgery, her patient didn't
have a Popsicle's chance in hell.

16:32.080 --> 16:37.359
By making the tough choice, she at least
gave Mrs Kahn an honest shot.

16:38.720 --> 16:43.111
Now, for all of you wait-and-see
doctors out there...

16:44.480 --> 16:46.471
...if you do not
get to the point

16:46.560 --> 16:49.233
where you have the courage
to take risks,

16:49.320 --> 16:51.788
you will never be a great doctor.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.831
- Never?
- Never ever.

17:10.319 --> 17:12.628
Turk, don't eat off my plate.

17:12.720 --> 17:15.108
You're right, baby.
I'm sorry. That's rude.

17:17.920 --> 17:20.275
So you're having steak
with a side of steak?

17:20.359 --> 17:22.999
That's right, turf and turf.

17:23.079 --> 17:26.117
You know what?
I'm on my second glass of good wine,

17:26.200 --> 17:29.590
I'm watching my boyfriend
try to eat his body weight in meat,

17:29.680 --> 17:31.511
and I am extremely tickled

17:31.600 --> 17:34.751
that the only thing Dr Cox
wants isn't on the menu.

17:37.680 --> 17:39.432
- What?
- What can I say?

17:39.520 --> 17:41.511
I'm finally having a good time.

17:41.600 --> 17:43.989
- That'll pass.
- I still think it's lame

17:44.080 --> 17:47.152
that you didn't like Turk's
nurse-practitioner present.

17:47.240 --> 17:49.993
- Dude.
- Told you.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.995
Hey, Elliot, I'm sorry
that I was such a jerk before,

17:55.080 --> 17:57.548
but, hey, I got mine, right?

17:59.120 --> 18:01.998
Anyway, thanks
for being classier than I am

18:02.080 --> 18:03.911
and not rubbing it in my face.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.037
No problem.
Hey, you never told me that

18:07.120 --> 18:10.510
- you're part Native American.
- What are you talking about?

18:10.600 --> 18:13.876
Aren't you a member
of the Waitensee tribe?

18:13.960 --> 18:16.428
Come on! I laughed so hard
when I thought of that

18:16.520 --> 18:18.431
that I peed a little.

18:19.960 --> 18:21.871
I changed right after.

18:24.880 --> 18:26.836
Why wouldn't you want a better job?

18:26.920 --> 18:30.595
Hold up. My baby's happy
with being just a nurse.

18:30.680 --> 18:33.717
Did I say "just a nurse"?
Nobody at this table said "just."

18:33.800 --> 18:36.837
I meant "a nurse."
Right, baby?

18:36.920 --> 18:38.035
That's right.

18:39.520 --> 18:41.192
Why?

18:41.280 --> 18:43.794
Oh, just not smart.
Even for you.

18:43.880 --> 18:48.158
Excuse me for not having
all your male ambition.

18:48.240 --> 18:50.800
I can't believe anyone
would look down on me

18:50.880 --> 18:55.158
because I'm good at what I do
and because I love doing it.

18:56.720 --> 18:59.393
- I'm sick to my stomach.
- Me too, Turk. Me too.

18:59.480 --> 19:03.632
No, baby, I'm serious.
I think I'm in trouble here.

19:03.720 --> 19:05.199
Baby?

19:08.120 --> 19:10.395
Permission to speak, sir?

19:10.480 --> 19:12.630
You know what? No.
No, you may not speak.

19:12.720 --> 19:15.917
Not now and not ever, OK?
You have overplayed your hand

19:16.000 --> 19:17.877
and you may never
talk to me again.

19:17.960 --> 19:20.713
Those are the rules
of the game.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.631
Then I quit.

19:22.720 --> 19:26.599
No, no, no quitsies. Checkmate,
gin, and Yahtzee, my friend.

19:26.680 --> 19:30.070
You know, my son used to love
to play Yahtzee with me,

19:30.160 --> 19:33.391
until you made me skip his play.
Now he won't eat.

19:33.480 --> 19:35.675
We've started a new game now,
haven't we?

19:35.760 --> 19:39.912
Yeah, it's called "You don't eat
until Timmy does."

19:49.920 --> 19:52.639
My mechanic has that poster
in his garage.

19:52.720 --> 19:55.234
Does he have this one?

19:55.320 --> 19:58.437
Actually,
it's a family business.

19:58.520 --> 20:01.830
So, here we are.

20:01.920 --> 20:03.592
Two people,

20:03.680 --> 20:05.591
street lamp,

20:05.680 --> 20:06.795
full moon.

20:06.880 --> 20:08.552
Guy pissing on the dumpster.

20:08.640 --> 20:12.110
Oh, did I break the mood?

20:13.840 --> 20:16.434
Fine, you want me
to drop the flirty crap?

20:16.520 --> 20:19.637
I'm interested in you.

20:19.720 --> 20:22.712
I think we're a lot alike,
I think we have chemistry,

20:22.800 --> 20:25.189
and I think you're scared,
so you use what I do

20:25.280 --> 20:27.635
as an excuse
not to give us a try.

20:29.800 --> 20:32.030
I'm sorry. I gotta go.

20:34.360 --> 20:35.873
You OK?

20:35.960 --> 20:39.111
Look at that. I bounced back.

20:48.680 --> 20:51.399
Baby, my stomach's gonna explode.

20:51.480 --> 20:54.199
It's only heartburn,
sweetie. You'll be fine.

20:57.760 --> 21:00.877
- How's meathead?
- I know I'm not a doctor,

21:00.960 --> 21:04.077
but if you order a strong anti-emetic,
that'd be great.

21:04.160 --> 21:07.914
You would ace that nurse
practitioners program.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.276
Really? You think so?

21:11.360 --> 21:13.316
What if the classes
are too hard?

21:13.400 --> 21:16.676
What if the teachers are mean,
if the other kids don't like me?

21:16.760 --> 21:18.557
- OK.
- I would ace that program.

21:18.640 --> 21:21.154
But I barely get to see
my boyfriend as it is.

21:21.240 --> 21:25.358
And if I went to class
five nights a week, well...

21:25.440 --> 21:28.750
I guess I'm taking my chances
on Turk right now.

21:28.840 --> 21:32.549
- Him?
- Somebody make it stop.

21:34.800 --> 21:37.997
I just don't want to look back
and wonder what could have been.

21:39.080 --> 21:41.640
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

21:49.560 --> 21:51.391
How's it going?

21:51.480 --> 21:53.311
You have more jokes, don't you?

21:53.400 --> 21:55.630
I jotted a couple of things down.

21:56.800 --> 21:59.792
You see that nurse over there?
I love her.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.515
Every night at 1 0.30
for the last year,

22:03.600 --> 22:06.273
I've watched her come in here
and get a cup of coffee

22:06.360 --> 22:09.716
and not once have I had the courage
to even ask her her name.

22:09.800 --> 22:13.429
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
she has a snaggletooth.

22:13.520 --> 22:15.750
The point is,
Kelso's right, you know.

22:15.840 --> 22:17.751
It's not even
just professionally.

22:17.840 --> 22:20.957
In my personal life,
I don't take any chances either.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.713
I want to. I just...

22:23.800 --> 22:26.678
I can never seem
to take that first step.

22:29.400 --> 22:31.231
- Come here.
- What?

22:31.320 --> 22:34.232
- Come on.
- I don't want to go anywhere.

22:34.320 --> 22:36.788
I wanna spend time
with Snaggletooth.

22:36.880 --> 22:41.476
I guess it all comes down
to what we're willing to risk.

22:41.560 --> 22:43.915
For some of us,
it's our feelings.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.911
Wanna talk?

22:47.880 --> 22:49.791
No.

22:51.640 --> 22:54.438
For others, it's our future.

22:54.520 --> 22:55.873
Baby.

22:55.960 --> 22:58.110
If I had to do it again,
I would.

22:58.200 --> 23:01.590
- Cos I love the steak.
- I know, popi.

23:01.680 --> 23:03.830
I know.

23:03.920 --> 23:07.993
For me, it was taking
a risk, period.

23:08.080 --> 23:11.197
Even if that meant starting
with my very first step.

23:11.280 --> 23:13.840
- You're gonna love this.
- I don't wanna do it.

23:13.920 --> 23:15.956
What's the worst
that could happen?

23:16.040 --> 23:18.235
- We could die!
- OK, the second worse?

23:18.320 --> 23:20.515
Can't we just go
and talk to Snaggletooth?

23:20.600 --> 23:21.589
No. Here we go.

23:21.680 --> 23:23.636
One, two, three!
