00:05.456 --> 00:08.591
Air and naval
forces of the United States

00:08.626 --> 00:11.461
launched a series of strikes
against terrorist facilities...

00:11.495 --> 00:13.463
Pan Am Flight 103 crashed
into the town of Lockerbie.

00:13.497 --> 00:14.831
He has sanctioned
acts of terror

00:14.865 --> 00:17.567
in Africa, Europe and
the Middle East.

00:17.601 --> 00:20.270
This will not stand, this
aggression against, uh, Kuwait.

00:20.304 --> 00:21.871
This relentless
pursuit of terror.

00:21.906 --> 00:23.573
We will make no distinction...

00:23.607 --> 00:25.175
The USS Cole was attacked

00:25.209 --> 00:26.342
while refueling in
the port of Aden.

00:26.377 --> 00:28.311
This was an act of terrorism.

00:28.345 --> 00:30.713
It was a despicable
and cowardly act.

00:30.748 --> 00:33.183
The next samba
we're going to swing for you

00:33.217 --> 00:34.317
is one of the good old
favorites.

00:34.351 --> 00:36.920
...until something stops him.

00:36.954 --> 00:39.756
It was right
in front of my eyes,

00:39.790 --> 00:41.424
and I never saw it coming.

00:41.458 --> 00:44.494
That plane crashed
into the World Trade Center.

00:44.528 --> 00:46.996
Thousands of people running.

00:47.031 --> 00:50.900
We must and we will remain
vigilant at home and abroad.

00:56.841 --> 00:59.008
You're the smartest
and the dumbest fucking person

00:59.043 --> 01:01.177
I've ever known.

01:01.212 --> 01:02.812
I'm not the
one who got it wrong.

01:02.847 --> 01:04.947
I'm the only one
who got it right.

01:08.819 --> 01:10.687
Take 'em.

01:10.721 --> 01:12.455
Take 'em all.

01:19.830 --> 01:22.206
Homeland - 3x03
"Tower Of David"

01:24.134 --> 01:26.102
Previously on Homeland...

01:26.136 --> 01:27.470
It wasn't me.

01:27.504 --> 01:29.439
It wasn't me.

01:29.473 --> 01:31.307
We have to go.

01:31.342 --> 01:32.709
What do you mean?
Go where?

01:32.743 --> 01:33.943
No one else will believe you.

01:33.978 --> 01:35.678
What are we doing here?

01:35.713 --> 01:37.714
Activating my insurance policy.

01:37.748 --> 01:39.482
A friend, June, will
meet us at the border.

01:39.516 --> 01:40.650
She'll drive us up to Montreal

01:40.684 --> 01:41.918
where we get onto
a fishing boat,

01:41.952 --> 01:43.519
which takes us up
to Newfoundland.

01:43.554 --> 01:45.355
The border's in a few miles.

01:45.389 --> 01:48.024
You're not coming, are you?

01:48.058 --> 01:50.593
I can't now.

01:50.628 --> 01:52.128
Have you seen the paper yet?

01:52.162 --> 01:55.865
CIA officer linked
to Langley Bomber.

01:55.900 --> 01:58.201
The case officer in question,

01:58.235 --> 02:00.503
she's been diagnosed as bipolar.

02:02.673 --> 02:03.940
It's Carrie.

02:03.974 --> 02:05.508
She called a reporter.

02:05.542 --> 02:07.510
Apparently she thinks
it's important they quote,

02:07.544 --> 02:09.612
"Hear her side
of the story."

02:09.646 --> 02:12.248
The CIA gave you
that story to set me up.

02:12.283 --> 02:13.383
For what?

02:13.417 --> 02:14.918
Nicholas Brody is
not responsible

02:14.952 --> 02:16.386
for the explosion at Langley.

02:16.420 --> 02:18.021
Did Saul Berenson know
when he testified

02:18.055 --> 02:19.055
before the senate subcommittee?

02:19.089 --> 02:20.223
Of course he did.

02:20.257 --> 02:21.991
Everything he said was bullshit.

02:22.026 --> 02:24.193
Did you tell anyone
that I was coming here?

02:24.228 --> 02:26.329
We've got a psychiatric
detention order.

02:26.363 --> 02:28.531
You know she's off
her meds, right?

02:28.565 --> 02:30.466
Unless you think
that's a good idea.

02:30.501 --> 02:32.368
You really have to help me.

02:35.673 --> 02:37.307
This is fucking sham!

02:44.414 --> 02:46.782
Carrie.

02:46.817 --> 02:48.784
I am so sorry.

02:54.124 --> 02:56.092
Fuck...

02:56.126 --> 02:59.895
you, Saul.

03:40.537 --> 03:43.372
Don't shoot!

03:43.407 --> 03:46.142
- Don't shoot!
- Get out from the truck!

03:46.143 --> 03:49.448
Don't shoot, don't shoot.
He's back there. He's back there.

03:49.552 --> 03:50.927
- He's alive.
- Look for him. Look for him.

03:50.928 --> 03:52.471
Don't shoot.
I saved his life.

03:52.472 --> 03:53.991
Go faster!

03:54.630 --> 03:55.697
You stay there!

03:55.698 --> 03:57.693
It's okay,
it's okay. All right.

03:57.694 --> 04:00.512
- What happened? - We got
ambushed by fucking Colombian soldiers.

04:00.513 --> 04:02.324
They killed two of us.

04:02.325 --> 04:03.437
Bring him to me,
bring him to me.

04:03.438 --> 04:05.327
Remember, I saved his life.

04:05.328 --> 04:07.661
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it.

04:09.767 --> 04:11.557
I brought him alive, man.

04:14.889 --> 04:17.403
Go, go, go.

04:18.731 --> 04:20.762
Remember, I saved his life.

04:20.762 --> 04:22.735
Fuck.

04:28.986 --> 04:31.587
- Go, go, go.
- Let's go.

04:51.208 --> 04:52.742
Move that car, move that car.

05:38.955 --> 05:40.956
Go, fast, get him off the car.

05:56.506 --> 05:59.742
Shit what happened to him?

05:59.776 --> 06:01.043
Something went wrong.

06:01.077 --> 06:02.812
I assumed.

06:02.846 --> 06:05.347
Um, across the border.

06:14.691 --> 06:17.026
Oh, my God.

06:17.060 --> 06:18.661
Esme!

06:18.695 --> 06:21.764
I'm coming.

06:26.903 --> 06:30.139
I'm going to take
a look at you now, okay?

06:31.274 --> 06:32.708
Are you a Doctor?

06:35.178 --> 06:37.146
Interesting question.

06:42.452 --> 06:46.355
I know.

06:46.389 --> 06:49.592
I know, I know it hurts.

06:49.626 --> 06:53.329
Could someone do something
about the lights?

06:53.363 --> 06:55.364
- Tranco.
- I'm coming.

06:57.601 --> 06:58.767
You've lost a lot of blood.

06:58.802 --> 07:00.703
You're in hypovolemic shock.

07:00.737 --> 07:03.706
We're going to try
to repair the bleeds.

07:08.645 --> 07:10.613
This will help with the pain.

07:13.283 --> 07:15.184
Enough, enough.

07:15.218 --> 07:16.886
We don't want to stop his heart.

07:21.157 --> 07:23.259
Okay, Paco?

07:23.293 --> 07:25.494
I need you
to hold something for me.

07:25.529 --> 07:26.896
Can you do that?

07:26.930 --> 07:27.930
Give me your hand.

07:27.964 --> 07:31.367
And put it right here.

07:32.936 --> 07:34.904
Right... there.

07:34.938 --> 07:36.205
- Can you feel it?
- Uh-huh.

07:36.239 --> 07:37.907
It's beating-- boom, boom, boom?

07:37.941 --> 07:38.908
Boom, boom, boom.

07:38.942 --> 07:40.209
Yes, yes, yes.

07:40.243 --> 07:42.278
Pinch it. Pinch.

07:43.713 --> 07:45.347
Don't let go.

07:47.584 --> 07:50.319
Where are my lights?

07:50.353 --> 07:52.388
Can't work
with a flickering light.

07:52.422 --> 07:54.223
Almost there.

07:54.257 --> 07:57.026
Where are my lights?

08:02.365 --> 08:04.366
Well done.

08:07.270 --> 08:09.738
Ah.

08:09.773 --> 08:11.373
Esme?

08:30.660 --> 08:33.562
Will he live?

08:33.597 --> 08:35.364
Depends.

08:35.398 --> 08:39.201
How old were those
antibiotics you got me?

08:42.405 --> 08:44.239
Oh, he'll make it.

08:44.274 --> 08:47.676
He's a strong one.

08:47.711 --> 08:49.211
You know who he is.

08:49.245 --> 08:52.581
Absolutely no idea.

08:54.618 --> 08:55.818
Just an anonymous stranger

08:55.852 --> 08:59.388
with two bullets in his gut.

09:01.024 --> 09:03.258
Though, hypothetically...

09:03.293 --> 09:05.227
I'm-I'm...

09:05.261 --> 09:07.262
I'm wondering.

09:09.366 --> 09:12.768
An American fugitive falls
in your lap.

09:12.802 --> 09:16.005
One with a bounty on his head.

09:16.039 --> 09:18.207
$10 million, dead or alive.

09:21.144 --> 09:24.079
Why go through a world
of trouble to save him...

09:24.114 --> 09:26.782
instead of just collecting
the reward?

09:26.816 --> 09:28.917
Maybe someone did you

09:28.952 --> 09:30.953
a favor once.

09:34.424 --> 09:36.659
Must be some favor.

09:43.066 --> 09:45.467
Don't, stay still.

09:45.502 --> 09:46.969
Be still.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.004
Easy, easy.

09:49.005 --> 09:51.423
Try to relax.
You'll rip those stitches out.

09:51.424 --> 09:55.432
There, there, there.

09:57.781 --> 09:59.548
Easy, easy, easy.

10:02.218 --> 10:03.519
No fever.

10:03.553 --> 10:06.155
No fever, that's a good thing.

10:14.731 --> 10:16.699
Yeah, yeah.

10:16.700 --> 10:17.700
Done.

10:44.861 --> 10:47.006
Ah, thank you.

10:49.299 --> 10:52.000
Ah, thank... thank you.

10:53.369 --> 10:55.370
Thanks.

12:18.388 --> 12:20.389
No!

12:21.558 --> 12:23.592
Stay there.

12:23.593 --> 12:25.665
You'll hurt yourself.

12:26.896 --> 12:27.896
Stay still.

12:27.897 --> 12:29.932
No, I want to get up.

12:29.966 --> 12:33.402
I want...

12:50.787 --> 12:52.721
No more.

12:52.755 --> 12:54.623
I can't think.

12:54.657 --> 12:57.159
No more, please.

13:05.301 --> 13:07.269
God.

13:08.504 --> 13:09.805
No.

13:09.839 --> 13:11.073
Will you help me
get up, please?

13:11.107 --> 13:12.140
No. Stay there.

13:13.376 --> 13:14.376
Stay there.

13:15.812 --> 13:17.813
Be careful, you'll get hurt.

13:19.082 --> 13:20.082
Easy.

13:20.083 --> 13:21.617
Need to see.

13:21.651 --> 13:22.718
No.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.820
Where am I?

13:58.855 --> 14:01.490
Caracas.

14:01.524 --> 14:03.825
Your new home.

14:04.827 --> 14:07.329
You shouldn't be up.

14:07.363 --> 14:08.630
Put him back on the bed.

14:08.631 --> 14:09.631
I told him...

14:10.466 --> 14:11.867
You need to rest.

14:11.901 --> 14:13.902
I got him, I got him.

14:13.903 --> 14:14.903
- Be careful.
- I'm careful.

14:16.250 --> 14:17.940
Sit down.

14:24.781 --> 14:27.382
You're lucky to be alive,
you know.

14:27.417 --> 14:30.185
Those Colombians,
they nearly killed you.

14:30.219 --> 14:32.955
There's a bounty on your head.

14:32.989 --> 14:34.423
I know.

14:34.457 --> 14:35.757
A big one.

14:35.792 --> 14:38.760
You're never safe,
even here with me.

14:40.096 --> 14:42.497
My wallet's missing,

14:42.532 --> 14:44.700
and so is my passport.

14:44.734 --> 14:46.568
Somebody took them.

14:46.602 --> 14:48.203
I couldn't stop him.

14:48.237 --> 14:51.073
I need my passport for travel.

14:52.575 --> 14:54.543
Don't worry about that.

14:56.145 --> 14:58.080
I can't get another one.

14:58.114 --> 15:00.916
Just-just get better now.

15:00.950 --> 15:03.719
We'll try to find out
who took your things.

15:06.589 --> 15:08.590
Make sure he
doesn't move from there.

15:08.591 --> 15:09.831
Don't let him go up or go down.

15:09.832 --> 15:11.708
Keep him here, okay?

15:11.709 --> 15:12.667
Yes, daddy.

15:12.668 --> 15:13.970
Good work, my girl.

15:15.098 --> 15:18.133
Why are you trying to help me?

15:22.839 --> 15:24.940
You know Carrie Mathison.

15:26.976 --> 15:29.077
So do I.

15:29.112 --> 15:31.913
Stay here on this floor.

16:25.068 --> 16:27.069
Done.

16:37.346 --> 16:39.281
Thank you.

17:33.369 --> 17:35.603
Oh, it feels good.

17:35.638 --> 17:39.407
To be walking.

17:40.409 --> 17:42.911
Walking?

17:42.945 --> 17:46.181
Walking.

17:58.594 --> 18:00.562
We're walking.

18:00.596 --> 18:02.864
We're walking.

18:02.898 --> 18:04.432
Yes, we're walking.

18:04.467 --> 18:06.434
We're walking.

18:07.470 --> 18:10.205
With a cane.

18:10.239 --> 18:11.940
BastÃ³n.

18:11.974 --> 18:13.975
BastÃ³n?

18:23.652 --> 18:25.487
We're walking with a cane.

18:25.521 --> 18:28.823
We're walking with a cane.

18:33.796 --> 18:36.431
Aah!

19:24.413 --> 19:26.047
Water?

19:26.081 --> 19:27.682
Oh, yes, yeah.

19:27.716 --> 19:29.684
Thanks.

19:39.762 --> 19:42.797
Thank you.

19:53.375 --> 19:55.043
I prescribe rest.

19:55.077 --> 19:57.579
You go gallivanting about.

19:57.613 --> 19:59.681
Paco?

20:01.717 --> 20:03.485
Trekking clear
across the building,

20:03.519 --> 20:04.752
what were you thinking?

20:08.424 --> 20:09.591
Esme?

20:15.331 --> 20:17.298
No.

20:18.667 --> 20:20.635
You sure?

20:20.669 --> 20:23.671
You seem like you're
in a lot of pain.

20:25.274 --> 20:26.875
I'll survive.

20:26.909 --> 20:28.843
Guess you're good
at that, aren't you?

20:34.049 --> 20:36.851
So, what'd you make of it?

20:37.887 --> 20:39.387
What?

20:39.421 --> 20:41.523
What you saw.

20:41.557 --> 20:45.493
This abscess beyond healing
we call home.

20:47.263 --> 20:49.531
They call it the Tower of David.

20:49.565 --> 20:50.865
Not for King David,

20:50.900 --> 20:52.834
heaven forbid.

20:52.868 --> 20:54.469
For David Brillembourg,

20:54.503 --> 20:57.272
the particularly
egomaniacal banker

20:57.306 --> 20:58.406
who commissioned it.

20:58.440 --> 21:01.242
Unfortunately, before
it was completed,

21:01.277 --> 21:02.677
David died.

21:02.711 --> 21:04.712
Then the whole economy died,

21:04.747 --> 21:06.014
construction stopped,

21:06.048 --> 21:08.883
the squatters all moved in,

21:08.918 --> 21:11.586
and viola.

21:15.457 --> 21:17.792
Scooch.

21:17.826 --> 21:19.127
Well, if you hate it...

21:19.161 --> 21:21.429
Did I say I hate it?

21:23.432 --> 21:26.034
So why are you here?

21:26.068 --> 21:29.437
That's a dangerous question.

21:29.471 --> 21:33.374
"Why am I here?"

21:33.409 --> 21:36.711
leads to "Why are you here?"

21:36.745 --> 21:39.113
You see?

21:43.485 --> 21:45.219
We're here

21:45.254 --> 21:47.088
because the world
outside can be...

21:47.122 --> 21:49.624
judgmental and cruel?

21:54.697 --> 21:57.799
We're here because this
is the place that accepts us.

22:00.536 --> 22:04.005
We're here
because we belong here.

22:05.407 --> 22:07.508
I'm not staying.

22:07.543 --> 22:09.077
Of course not.

22:11.347 --> 22:13.648
I just need
to get my strength back.

22:13.682 --> 22:15.650
Don't we all

22:15.684 --> 22:19.420
need to get our strength back?

23:12.775 --> 23:15.343
There it goes!

23:16.345 --> 23:18.346
There!

23:59.221 --> 24:00.788
Come.

24:05.194 --> 24:07.161
Where?

24:48.403 --> 24:51.105
Yours.

24:54.109 --> 24:56.077
Thanks.

24:56.111 --> 24:57.378
Is this...

24:57.412 --> 24:59.280
Is this him?

24:59.314 --> 25:01.315
Is this the man

25:01.350 --> 25:03.017
that robbed you?

25:05.053 --> 25:07.421
Is it?

25:08.423 --> 25:11.292
He says he did it.

25:12.294 --> 25:14.428
Yeah, okay, but...

25:17.266 --> 25:18.466
No, no, no, wait, wait a second.

25:18.500 --> 25:19.467
No!

25:19.501 --> 25:20.735
No, no, don't!

25:20.769 --> 25:22.170
Get the...

25:24.673 --> 25:26.707
You didn't have to kill him!

25:26.742 --> 25:28.476
No?

25:28.510 --> 25:29.911
No, you didn't.

25:29.945 --> 25:31.913
Fine. It's okay,
it's okay.

25:33.949 --> 25:36.017
We let people rob us,
no problem.

25:36.051 --> 25:38.519
And then what
if they recognize you

25:38.554 --> 25:40.121
with ten million dollars
on your head?

25:40.155 --> 25:41.889
What stops them from saying,

25:41.924 --> 25:43.791
"I know where he is."

25:43.826 --> 25:45.827
Hmm?

25:52.467 --> 25:54.468
Back to your room.

25:57.973 --> 26:00.942
- Go.
- Let's go. Let's go.

26:22.931 --> 26:24.198
Where you go?

26:25.868 --> 26:27.368
Somewhere else.

26:31.907 --> 26:33.040
Do you have money?

26:33.075 --> 26:34.041
I need money.

26:34.076 --> 26:36.744
Dinero?

26:36.778 --> 26:38.312
Dinero!
Do you have any?

26:45.087 --> 26:46.854
Don't go.

26:46.889 --> 26:48.623
I can't stay here.

27:07.075 --> 27:09.076
Hey, stop there.

27:10.712 --> 27:11.879
You stop!

27:11.914 --> 27:13.547
I'm going out.

27:20.756 --> 27:22.156
I need to leave.

27:23.759 --> 27:24.992
Go out there.

27:25.027 --> 27:26.427
I need to get out of here.

27:26.461 --> 27:27.662
Where?

27:28.797 --> 27:30.431
Where you think you go?

27:32.100 --> 27:33.067
Out.

27:33.101 --> 27:35.803
Out... out where?

27:38.273 --> 27:39.507
To the next place.

27:39.541 --> 27:41.442
I've been taken from
one place to the next.

27:41.476 --> 27:42.743
From here to there to here...

27:42.778 --> 27:44.045
You were nearly killed.

27:44.079 --> 27:45.880
I can't stay here.

27:45.914 --> 27:47.114
Why?

27:47.149 --> 27:49.150
It's...

27:49.184 --> 27:50.384
it's not good enough?

27:50.419 --> 27:51.619
No, I didn't mean that.

27:51.653 --> 27:52.920
Not, not good enough for you?

27:52.955 --> 27:55.790
Huh?

27:55.824 --> 27:57.391
Oh, I guess it's
because of that-that thief?

27:57.426 --> 27:59.193
He... he upset you?

28:00.929 --> 28:03.264
Look...

28:03.298 --> 28:05.933
I appreciate all you've
done for me, okay?

28:05.968 --> 28:06.934
But I'm better now.

28:06.969 --> 28:08.369
What does that mean?

28:08.403 --> 28:09.870
Means I can make it on my own.

28:09.905 --> 28:11.706
I just need to get
to the next place.

28:11.740 --> 28:13.774
There's no next place.

28:13.809 --> 28:15.943
What? There has to be.

28:17.846 --> 28:20.815
No.

28:20.849 --> 28:22.483
Does Carrie know I'm here?
Does she?

28:22.517 --> 28:24.018
No one can know.

28:26.254 --> 28:28.055
We have to tell her.

28:28.090 --> 28:29.056
I call her on the phone?

28:29.091 --> 28:30.658
- Huh?
- No, I didn't mean that.

28:30.692 --> 28:31.659
Or better yet, or better yet,

28:31.693 --> 28:33.694
a postcard then?
Or we just call the CIA,

28:33.729 --> 28:37.331
they give us $10 million--
split it, eh... even Steven?

28:39.601 --> 28:41.869
I tell you last time,

28:41.903 --> 28:46.707
where you are,
Carrie doesn't want to know.

28:46.742 --> 28:50.044
This is it for you.

28:50.078 --> 28:52.947
End of the line.

29:22.010 --> 29:23.711
El NiÃ±o thinks
you're an ingrate.

29:26.214 --> 29:27.915
I assured him
you're just confused.

29:35.524 --> 29:37.358
But he's right, you know.

29:37.392 --> 29:39.827
This is your home.

29:42.197 --> 29:43.697
It isn't easy to accept--

29:43.732 --> 29:44.932
believe me, I know.

29:44.966 --> 29:46.667
It's not how you pictured yourself.

29:46.701 --> 29:47.868
You weren't planning this.

29:47.903 --> 29:50.037
There must be some mistake,
and on and on.

29:54.509 --> 29:57.144
Those voices in your head are
not your friends right now.

29:57.179 --> 29:58.679
You have to make them go away.

30:05.854 --> 30:08.222
The Germans who invented it...

30:10.158 --> 30:11.992
had a special name
for a medicine

30:12.027 --> 30:14.662
powerful enough to do just that.

30:16.198 --> 30:19.100
"Hero-isch."

30:19.134 --> 30:20.668
"Heroic."

30:20.702 --> 30:23.571
The drug is.

30:23.605 --> 30:25.573
So you don't have to be.

30:34.916 --> 30:35.916
Get out.

30:39.421 --> 30:41.489
Come, Paco.

30:41.523 --> 30:42.490
Come, come.

30:52.200 --> 30:54.168
I slept six whole hours
yesterday.

30:54.202 --> 30:56.504
I can't remember the last
time that happened, so...

30:56.538 --> 31:00.007
Yeah, all things considered,
I feel pretty damn lucid.

31:00.041 --> 31:01.742
And you're drinking
enough water?

31:01.776 --> 31:03.544
I think so.

31:03.578 --> 31:06.480
Any headaches?

31:06.515 --> 31:08.215
They'll go away.

31:08.250 --> 31:09.416
This isn't my first time

31:09.451 --> 31:11.185
acclimating to lithium,
you know?

31:11.219 --> 31:13.521
Dizzy spells?

31:13.555 --> 31:14.989
One or two.

31:15.023 --> 31:17.591
Nothing unbearable.

31:21.830 --> 31:25.633
I was wondering if you could
tell Saul Berenson

31:25.667 --> 31:28.135
how much better I'm doing.

31:28.170 --> 31:31.438
What... makes you think
I'm in touch with Saul Berenson?

31:31.473 --> 31:33.774
We both know who you're writing
those notes for.

31:33.808 --> 31:36.443
You think I'm reporting back
to the CIA?

31:36.478 --> 31:37.478
I know you are.

31:37.512 --> 31:38.979
And that's fine.

31:39.014 --> 31:40.247
Just...

31:40.282 --> 31:41.782
tell Saul

31:41.816 --> 31:43.484
I'm sorry I fucked up.

31:43.518 --> 31:45.119
It won't happen again.

31:45.153 --> 31:47.087
What do you mean you fucked up?

31:47.122 --> 31:49.323
I mean...
I went off my meds.

31:49.357 --> 31:51.358
Clearly, that was a bad idea.

31:51.393 --> 31:54.261
You told Dr. Harlan
your meds dulled you.

31:56.665 --> 31:59.066
Well, maybe that's not
such a bad thing.

32:00.302 --> 32:02.603
This is quite
the sea change for you.

32:07.475 --> 32:09.410
After three weeks
in here, it's...

32:09.444 --> 32:11.312
hard to hold on to any grudges.

32:11.346 --> 32:14.148
So Saul did you a favor
putting you in the hospital.

32:16.952 --> 32:18.552
Yes.

32:18.587 --> 32:20.588
Removing you from
a delusional relationship.

32:20.622 --> 32:22.623
With a suspected
terrorist, no less.

32:22.657 --> 32:24.358
That was his testimony,
wasn't it?

32:27.796 --> 32:29.763
It was.

32:29.798 --> 32:31.765
You're saying that
was the right thing to do?

32:33.134 --> 32:35.803
Yes.

32:35.837 --> 32:37.771
And you honestly believe that?

32:40.609 --> 32:41.775
Carrie...

32:41.810 --> 32:44.445
I want you to answer truthfully.

32:44.479 --> 32:45.613
I want you to recover.

32:45.647 --> 32:47.948
From what?

32:47.983 --> 32:49.717
We both know I'm not here
because I'm crazy.

32:49.751 --> 32:51.785
I'm here because they don't
know where else to put me.

32:51.820 --> 32:53.621
- No one said you were crazy.
- Well, no one had to.

32:53.655 --> 32:55.456
I'm in a fucking psych ward.

32:59.227 --> 33:00.194
Look...

33:01.630 --> 33:04.265
the sooner I can talk to Saul,
the sooner I can go home

33:04.299 --> 33:08.235
and you can go back to doing
something useful with your life.

33:15.076 --> 33:16.477
W-What are you writing?

33:18.913 --> 33:20.314
I was out of line just then.

33:20.348 --> 33:22.583
I'm sorry. I...

33:22.617 --> 33:24.318
You want to earn
your visiting privileges,

33:24.352 --> 33:26.453
you'll have to be a bit
more cooperative than that.

33:26.488 --> 33:28.455
I know.

33:28.490 --> 33:31.058
And then there's the question of
the efficacy of your medication.

33:31.092 --> 33:34.094
All right, I'm sorry, I just...

33:39.334 --> 33:41.869
Will you please tell Saul
that I'm better?

34:19.908 --> 34:20.908
Hey...

34:22.944 --> 34:25.179
They see you.

34:25.213 --> 34:26.612
You can't do that.

34:26.648 --> 34:27.848
I have to.

34:27.882 --> 34:28.882
No...

34:30.118 --> 34:32.786
He know.
He know.

34:32.821 --> 34:34.254
He know what happened.

34:37.826 --> 34:39.393
Listen. Stop.

34:43.598 --> 34:45.966
Please...

34:46.000 --> 34:47.534
I can't stay here.

34:49.571 --> 34:50.904
I can't.

34:50.938 --> 34:51.905
I have to leave.

34:51.940 --> 34:53.139
I have to go out there.

34:53.174 --> 34:54.440
I can't live here.

34:54.476 --> 34:56.443
It's not safe
out there for you.

34:56.444 --> 34:58.190
You're safe in here.

34:58.225 --> 34:59.067
Here.

35:00.448 --> 35:02.883
No aqui.

35:08.890 --> 35:10.357
I'll die here.

35:11.960 --> 35:13.827
No place to go.

35:18.967 --> 35:19.933
There is a place.

35:20.969 --> 35:22.269
There is.

35:23.671 --> 35:26.073
There is...

35:26.107 --> 35:28.575
there is somewhere to go.

35:28.610 --> 35:29.576
No. My father say...

35:29.611 --> 35:31.645
There is a place.

35:31.679 --> 35:33.447
The mosque.

35:37.385 --> 35:38.986
Will you help me?

35:47.695 --> 35:49.296
Well, well...

35:49.330 --> 35:51.598
that's really quite something.

35:51.633 --> 35:52.800
Is that a little balcony?

35:52.834 --> 35:54.935
It is, yeah.

35:54.969 --> 35:56.670
- It's just darling.
- Thanks.

35:56.704 --> 36:00.641
Mike, Sarah--
come look at this.

36:03.077 --> 36:04.178
Isn't that lovely?

36:04.212 --> 36:06.280
Look at all the detail.

36:06.314 --> 36:07.681
Can I use the restroom?

36:07.715 --> 36:09.950
Of course.

36:11.753 --> 36:13.987
Jim, why don't you put
some paint on that?

36:22.964 --> 36:24.064
Carrie, are you in here?

36:24.098 --> 36:25.065
- Yeah, I'm fine...
- What, what...

36:25.099 --> 36:26.233
I needed to get out of there.

36:26.267 --> 36:27.367
...what happened?
Are you all right?

36:27.402 --> 36:28.502
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- You're...

36:28.536 --> 36:29.803
- I just had to get out of there.
- ...bleeding.

36:29.838 --> 36:31.438
What?

36:31.473 --> 36:32.806
Oh, shit.

36:32.841 --> 36:36.210
Honey, if you are hurting
yourself, I need to know.

36:36.244 --> 36:37.678
No, I said I'm fine.

36:37.712 --> 36:39.947
I know, Carrie, what you said.

36:39.981 --> 36:42.616
Let me see.

36:42.650 --> 36:44.651
Look, I had a bad moment--
that's all.

36:44.686 --> 36:46.119
I'm-I'm taking my lithium.

36:46.154 --> 36:47.754
I'm going to group.

36:47.789 --> 36:49.590
I'm doing everything
that's asked of me.

36:49.624 --> 36:51.992
I'm... okay. Okay.

36:52.026 --> 36:54.228
That's it. That's it.

36:54.262 --> 36:55.562
Okay?

36:55.597 --> 36:56.563
That's all right.

36:56.598 --> 36:57.798
It's all right now.

36:57.832 --> 36:59.766
Okay, that's okay.

37:01.903 --> 37:03.170
Please don't tell.

37:03.204 --> 37:04.605
Okay.

37:29.431 --> 37:31.431
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

37:31.432 --> 37:34.694
- Be careful out there.
- Yeah, sure.

38:06.834 --> 38:10.737
So promise me this will
not happen again.

38:10.772 --> 38:11.805
I promise.

38:11.839 --> 38:13.440
- Because, if it does...
- It won't.

38:13.474 --> 38:14.441
I was just frustrated.

38:14.475 --> 38:16.143
Okay. When I get frustrated,

38:16.177 --> 38:18.679
I take a deep breath
and I count to ten.

38:22.150 --> 38:24.551
Hey, Carrie, keep your head up.

38:24.586 --> 38:26.620
It's not like they're
going to forget you in here.

38:26.654 --> 38:28.689
Someone's already
come by to check on you.

38:28.723 --> 38:31.491
- Who?
- I'm not sure.

38:31.526 --> 38:32.793
What, you didn't get his name?

38:32.827 --> 38:34.761
Nope. He didn't say.

38:34.796 --> 38:36.330
He asked about you,
how you're doing.

38:36.364 --> 38:37.531
We don't tell 'em anything.

38:37.565 --> 38:38.732
Well, if he comes again,
let me know.

38:38.766 --> 38:40.100
I need to see him.

38:40.134 --> 38:42.736
Okay, as soon as you're
granted visiting privileges...

38:42.770 --> 38:43.737
No. Sooner than that.

38:43.771 --> 38:44.805
It's Saul. Has to be.

38:44.839 --> 38:45.906
Okay, honey,

38:45.940 --> 38:47.774
let's get you back
to group, okay?

38:47.809 --> 38:49.409
Will you promise me?

38:50.612 --> 38:52.779
Carrie, I've already
risked my job once.

38:52.814 --> 38:55.082
And this is the last favor
I'll ask. I mean it.

39:02.457 --> 39:04.458
People see you.

39:04.492 --> 39:06.360
They know.

39:06.394 --> 39:09.696
Oh, the Imam won't turn me in.

39:09.731 --> 39:11.198
He'll help me.

39:11.232 --> 39:13.200
I'm a Muslim.

39:15.236 --> 39:16.737
Me...

39:16.771 --> 39:18.205
me Muslim.

39:22.377 --> 39:23.543
See? Refuge.

39:23.578 --> 39:26.113
Refugio.

39:39.961 --> 39:41.745
Perfect.

39:46.801 --> 39:48.335
Take me with you.

39:49.370 --> 39:51.371
What? No.

39:51.406 --> 39:53.774
You can't leave me here.

39:53.808 --> 39:55.409
No, I can't take you with me.

39:55.443 --> 39:57.377
No, I...

39:57.412 --> 39:58.879
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

39:58.913 --> 40:00.313
I can't.

40:00.348 --> 40:02.449
I can't. I...

40:02.483 --> 40:04.317
I'm sorry.

40:15.329 --> 40:16.496
Salaam Alaykum.

40:16.531 --> 40:18.231
Alaykum Salaam.

41:44.608 --> 41:46.730
Thank you, thank you.

42:24.325 --> 42:25.659
Someone's here to see me.

42:25.693 --> 42:26.860
I need an elevator key.

42:26.894 --> 42:28.795
If you could just
wait in the rec room.

42:28.830 --> 42:30.897
No, I have a visitor.
I have to see him.

42:30.932 --> 42:32.199
You're still not on the list.

42:32.233 --> 42:34.167
Please?
He's waiting for me.

42:34.202 --> 42:35.969
I need you to calm down.

42:36.003 --> 42:37.370
I am calm.

42:37.405 --> 42:38.939
Where's Abby?

42:38.973 --> 42:40.240
She's on break.

42:40.274 --> 42:41.641
Well, will you go get her?

42:41.676 --> 42:42.976
Because he's
going to leave soon.

42:43.010 --> 42:45.078
Okay, now, let's
talk about this.

42:45.112 --> 42:46.646
Jesus. Where the fuck is Abby?

42:46.681 --> 42:48.281
- What's going on here?
- Oh, thank God.

42:48.316 --> 42:49.783
Someone's here to see me.
He's downstairs.

42:49.817 --> 42:50.884
All right, all right.

42:50.918 --> 42:52.385
I-I'll handle this.

42:52.420 --> 42:53.887
We'll take her back
to her room.

42:53.921 --> 42:55.722
Come on. Let's go.

42:58.259 --> 42:59.693
It's Saul.

42:59.727 --> 43:02.495
- I saw him through the window.
- Keep your voice down.

44:02.089 --> 44:04.291
You're not a Muslim.

44:06.327 --> 44:08.128
You are a terrorist.

44:30.618 --> 44:32.085
No, no, no.

44:32.119 --> 44:33.153
Don't! What are you doing?

44:54.108 --> 44:56.142
Saul?

44:57.178 --> 44:58.244
Saul?

44:58.279 --> 44:59.646
Hi.

44:59.680 --> 45:01.514
Who are you?

45:01.549 --> 45:02.682
Paul Franklin.

45:02.717 --> 45:03.817
What happened to your head?

45:03.851 --> 45:05.986
Uh, I-I fell.
Did Saul send you?

45:06.020 --> 45:08.888
No. I'm pretty sure he wouldn't
approve of my being here.

45:08.923 --> 45:10.957
I'm an associate
at Bennett, Parr and Hamilton.

45:10.992 --> 45:12.025
We're a law firm.

45:12.059 --> 45:13.293
Yeah, I know.
I've heard of you.

45:13.327 --> 45:16.896
Is there anywhere we could speak
a little more privately?

45:23.604 --> 45:26.202
- Come on, come on.
- It wasn't his fault, dad.

45:26.203 --> 45:28.457
- It wasn't his fault.
- Enough, enough.

45:28.458 --> 45:29.808
It wasn't his fault.

45:29.844 --> 45:31.211
Esme.

45:47.895 --> 45:50.397
I told you, don't leave.

45:50.431 --> 45:52.832
But you go.

45:52.867 --> 45:55.101
This... this is
what happens.

45:55.136 --> 45:56.236
We all get trouble.

45:56.270 --> 45:57.470
So now you stay here.

45:57.505 --> 45:58.772
Here, between these walls.

45:58.806 --> 46:00.173
This is your new home.

46:00.207 --> 46:02.876
You will eat here, sleep here,
shit here, die here.

46:02.910 --> 46:04.277
Carrie won't save you.

46:04.311 --> 46:05.879
No one will.

46:05.913 --> 46:08.281
Understand?

46:10.851 --> 46:13.086
Do you understand me?

46:15.589 --> 46:16.923
Yes.

46:18.025 --> 46:20.226
And you stay away
from my daughter.

46:20.261 --> 46:22.362
You stay away.

46:31.872 --> 46:34.174
Fucking lunatic...

46:40.948 --> 46:43.283
Been a naughty boy.

46:45.219 --> 46:47.287
Naughty, naughty boy.

46:52.126 --> 46:54.160
I heard you had
a difficult hearing.

46:54.195 --> 46:55.829
"Difficult"
doesn't really cover it.

46:55.863 --> 46:58.565
So we both know you could
be here for quite a while.

47:01.001 --> 47:04.003
One of our partners
would like to meet with you.

47:04.038 --> 47:05.738
Well, he knows
where to find me.

47:05.773 --> 47:07.006
I don't think you understand.

47:07.041 --> 47:09.576
I'm talking about
getting you out of here.

47:11.912 --> 47:13.446
You could do that?

47:19.086 --> 47:21.488
Why would you want to help me?

47:21.522 --> 47:24.224
As I said, I'm here
on behalf of a partner.

47:24.258 --> 47:25.658
And what does he want?

47:25.693 --> 47:26.893
Simply to talk to you.

47:26.927 --> 47:28.094
About?

47:28.129 --> 47:29.229
Whatever it is,

47:29.263 --> 47:30.997
it's important enough
that he sent me.

47:32.633 --> 47:34.501
Look, I know how that sounds.

47:34.535 --> 47:36.336
In your position,
I'd be paranoid, too.

47:36.370 --> 47:38.905
You don't know the first
thing about my position.

47:38.939 --> 47:41.341
I know you don't belong here.

47:41.375 --> 47:43.143
That you're not actually crazy.

47:43.177 --> 47:44.644
And I know you
want nothing more

47:44.678 --> 47:46.846
than to get out and go home.

47:49.016 --> 47:50.683
Carrie...

47:50.718 --> 47:52.852
I'm on your side.

47:59.693 --> 48:01.995
Are you all right?

48:03.531 --> 48:04.898
I'm just... I'm
trying to remember

48:04.932 --> 48:06.466
where I've heard
that line before.

48:06.500 --> 48:07.567
What line?

48:07.601 --> 48:09.802
"I'm on your side."

48:09.837 --> 48:11.104
I know what you're doing.

48:11.138 --> 48:12.305
What do you mean?

48:12.339 --> 48:13.773
I mean I'm a case officer.

48:13.807 --> 48:15.575
I used to recruit
assets for a living.

48:15.609 --> 48:16.609
This isn't like that.

48:16.644 --> 48:17.911
Isn't it?

48:17.945 --> 48:20.013
- No, you think I'm vulnerable.
- Not at all.

48:20.047 --> 48:21.781
No, worse than that.
You think I'm weak,

48:21.815 --> 48:23.516
and maybe, with just
the right incentive,

48:23.551 --> 48:25.919
I'll turn against the
people who did this to me.

48:26.954 --> 48:28.755
Well, I'm telling you no.

48:28.789 --> 48:31.090
So whoever the hell it
is you're working for--

48:31.125 --> 48:33.193
the Syrians, the Israelis,
the Iranians--

48:33.227 --> 48:34.694
you tell them that.

48:34.728 --> 48:37.197
You tell them I would
rather die in here.

48:37.231 --> 48:38.264
You're not seeing this clearly.

48:38.299 --> 48:39.566
Yeah, which part
did I get wrong?

49:02.790 --> 49:04.524
Meds.

49:08.128 --> 49:10.396
Carrie?

49:10.431 --> 49:12.198
Are you all right?

49:12.233 --> 49:13.233
I need my meds.

49:26.213 --> 49:28.414
What are we
going to do with you?

49:31.552 --> 49:33.419
I can't stay here.

49:34.488 --> 49:36.489
Of course you can.

49:38.459 --> 49:40.460
It's like the hole in Iraq.

49:40.494 --> 49:42.262
I can't do it again.

49:42.296 --> 49:45.231
Well, I'm sure
you'll find a way.

49:51.872 --> 49:54.340
Everywhere you go,

49:54.375 --> 49:57.910
other people die,

49:57.945 --> 50:01.114
but you always
manage to survive.

50:01.148 --> 50:03.349
Have you noticed that?

50:05.119 --> 50:07.920
You're like a cockroach,

50:07.955 --> 50:13.760
still there after the last
nuclear bombs go off.

50:21.001 --> 50:23.803
You belong here.

50:25.572 --> 50:27.540
Am I right?

50:54.568 --> 50:56.269
Come on.

52:47.938 --> 52:55.245
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

52:57.521 --> 52:59.332
Saul's not talking to me anymore,
so you have to.

52:59.429 --> 53:00.355
What do you want
me to tell him?

53:00.471 --> 53:02.936
I give up. I can't stand
another second in this place.

53:03.015 --> 53:04.736
ON THE NEXT HOMELAND

53:04.835 --> 53:06.130
- You're out.
- I can go?

53:06.221 --> 53:07.530
How the hell did that happen?

53:07.685 --> 53:09.815
â™ª for 24 hours, so...

53:09.896 --> 53:11.216
Listen to what the
man has to say.

53:11.307 --> 53:13.006
She's vulnerable.
Right now, she could be

53:13.091 --> 53:15.486
- saying anything to anybody.
- Find her.

53:15.651 --> 53:16.609
I'm not a traitor.

53:16.715 --> 53:20.626
What you are is a liability to a lot of
people who've got a lot to lose.

53:20.845 --> 53:22.257
What are you doing here?
