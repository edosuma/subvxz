WEBVTT

00:00.600 --> 00:01.580
(dramatic music)

00:01.680 --> 00:02.700
- I'll be the dad,

00:02.800 --> 00:05.100
August is like there perfect sperm donor.

00:05.200 --> 00:06.780
This is our child.

00:06.880 --> 00:08.420
- Some women are not meant to be mothers

00:08.520 --> 00:09.620
and you're one of them.

00:09.720 --> 00:12.380
- This is about my family
and that's not you.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.480
- Let's get this party started.

00:15.240 --> 00:16.980
- [Man] He full on frat
boy date raped her.

00:17.080 --> 00:19.500
- You need to expose him
for who he really is.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.580
- I want Roger and Maya
locked in a room together

00:21.680 --> 00:23.220
by episode four.

00:23.320 --> 00:24.300
- Where are the fireworks.

00:24.400 --> 00:26.780
- They're coming, they're
just not coming tonight.

00:26.880 --> 00:28.220
- Faith, why'd you come on TV?

00:28.320 --> 00:30.580
- [Faith] My church kicked
me out for loving a woman.

00:30.680 --> 00:34.420
- There is a whole world of
people waiting who love you.

00:34.520 --> 00:36.800
- You are the reason
that I work on this show.

00:38.920 --> 00:40.340
- To hell with being a producer.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.180
You're the suitress.

00:42.280 --> 00:44.420
Is (mumbles) party your bang-athon?

00:44.520 --> 00:47.340
- I'm not sure I'm ready for all of this.

00:47.440 --> 00:49.900
- Quinn's pregnant with your baby.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.860
- What the hell happened with August?

00:51.960 --> 00:54.220
He just asked me to be his new producer.

00:54.320 --> 00:57.980
- I made a huge mistake, I
wanna go back to where we were.

00:58.080 --> 01:01.000
(intriguing music)

01:14.760 --> 01:16.540
- You okay?

01:16.640 --> 01:19.900
- It's Quinn, a little
piece of me is gonna be out

01:20.000 --> 01:23.900
in this world and no idea I'm it's father.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.740
It just feels like a nightmare.

01:26.840 --> 01:28.840
- August.

01:29.760 --> 01:30.500
- Yeah?

01:30.600 --> 01:31.820
- Quinn doesn't want that baby

01:31.920 --> 01:36.660
and she's not gonna have it.

01:36.760 --> 01:38.760
- How can you be so sure?

01:42.160 --> 01:44.920
(dramatic music)

02:08.360 --> 02:10.660
- Ah, looks like all you
needed to get over August

02:10.760 --> 02:12.760
was a house call from Dr. Jack.

02:13.560 --> 02:15.580
- I needed zero help getting over August,

02:15.680 --> 02:16.940
I barely remember he exists.

02:17.040 --> 02:21.780
- Ah, Fiona is happy and
involved with the last show

02:21.880 --> 02:25.140
which makes me happy as
balls balls. (laughs)

02:25.240 --> 02:26.900
- Yeah, that expression
is never gonna catch on.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.100
- I don't know I could
see myself using that.

02:29.200 --> 02:30.940
- Alright I teed her up

02:31.040 --> 02:32.700
so tonight's episode is going to be huge.

02:32.800 --> 02:34.020
- Okay, well I hate to brag

02:34.120 --> 02:36.500
but everything that I've set
up is perfectly in place.

02:36.600 --> 02:38.300
- Yeah, nothing braggy about that.

02:38.400 --> 02:41.300
- Including our surprise
therapist who's gonna make sure

02:41.400 --> 02:43.700
Maya finally finds the courage she needs.

02:43.800 --> 02:46.460
- Alright but I don't want
Oprah hugs and tears, right?

02:46.560 --> 02:49.500
I want a Jerry Springer
shit show confrontation.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.220
- Well, our after party has a pitch fork

02:51.320 --> 02:53.580
and a stockade so yeah, you're good to go.

02:53.680 --> 02:54.660
- Nice, I love it.

02:54.760 --> 02:57.300
- And I've got a challenge
that will add fuel to the fire,

02:57.400 --> 03:01.180
get Maya ready to explode,
eggs marks the spot.

03:01.280 --> 03:03.500
- Wow, and here I thought you
can come up with a worst name

03:03.600 --> 03:05.100
than hump or dump.

03:05.200 --> 03:07.660
- Okay look I don't give a
queef what you call it, alright

03:07.760 --> 03:11.500
as long as Maya is prime to
unleash on Roger big time.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.860
Oh come on, ditch the moral face, Jay.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.540
Everlasting is about to explode

03:16.640 --> 03:20.580
into a girl power rape
revenge witch trial, right?

03:20.680 --> 03:22.700
- Hello, hope I'm interupting.

03:22.800 --> 03:26.660
- Balls, balls, Chetty,
buddy, how you doing?

03:26.760 --> 03:28.380
Cynthia what the hell are you doing here?

03:28.480 --> 03:31.340
- I just got a last second invitation

03:31.440 --> 03:34.300
to the Creo-Lux Retreat in Sun Valley

03:34.400 --> 03:37.980
but the stupid nanny's on
vacation, worst time ever,

03:38.080 --> 03:42.580
so we are gonna give you a
what you so desperately want.

03:42.680 --> 03:46.360
Three days, temporary visitation.

03:47.200 --> 03:50.220
- That's incredible,
Chetty, you and me, oh ...

03:50.320 --> 03:54.740
- (laughs) Why don't we
go play with the woman

03:54.840 --> 03:57.660
that Daddy left Mommy for.

03:57.760 --> 03:59.740
Oh she's so much fun.

03:59.840 --> 04:03.460
Yes, you're gonna have
such a good time with her.

04:03.560 --> 04:05.680
Have fun, bye bye.

04:07.840 --> 04:12.220
- Chet, Chet, less gawking
and more working people,

04:12.320 --> 04:13.500
go make television.

04:13.600 --> 04:18.660
Hey Chet, listen, I am
really happy for you, okay

04:18.760 --> 04:21.540
but this is a critical day and
we can't have the kid around.

04:21.640 --> 04:24.220
How did Cynthia get into
Creo-Lux last minute, huh?

04:24.320 --> 04:25.260
- Just take him to the zoo,

04:25.360 --> 04:26.540
take him to wherever you take a kid

04:26.640 --> 04:27.700
but just get him the hell out of here.

04:27.800 --> 04:30.700
- It's no problem, this is gonna
be the greatest bonding day

04:30.800 --> 04:33.740
between the son and a father ever.

04:33.840 --> 04:34.740
You've ever been to the track?

04:34.840 --> 04:37.460
It's like a horsie zoo with wagering.

04:37.560 --> 04:39.820
What kind of money do you have,
do you have any allowance?

04:39.920 --> 04:41.260
- What?

04:41.360 --> 04:43.260
- You wanted my full support
with this baby thing, right?

04:43.360 --> 04:46.860
So here it is, you're gonna
have to do this sooner or later.

04:46.960 --> 04:49.140
I mean, there is no
convenient time to be a mom.

04:49.240 --> 04:51.820
Don't send him to the zoo.

04:51.920 --> 04:54.580
I mean, powerful women, they multi-task.

04:54.680 --> 04:56.260
You just set up a space for him here.

04:56.360 --> 04:58.580
It's what Shaunda does.

04:58.680 --> 05:00.940
- Your support is killing me right now.

05:01.040 --> 05:03.800
(dramatic music)

05:05.760 --> 05:10.060
- Howdy, hey you're a
Noelle's producer, no?

05:10.160 --> 05:10.860
- Yes.

05:10.960 --> 05:11.700
- And yes means?

05:11.800 --> 05:13.260
- Yes, I'm her producer.

05:13.360 --> 05:15.780
- So you're the one telling
her to play hard to get, no?

05:15.880 --> 05:18.420
- (laughs) Maybe.

05:18.520 --> 05:20.520
- Yeah, well look at these boys,

05:22.040 --> 05:24.700
I'm not threatened by any of them.

05:24.800 --> 05:26.800
- Yeah, me either.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.860
- I don't know what your mother's
been telling you about me

05:31.960 --> 05:35.220
but I've been trying
really hard to see you.

05:35.320 --> 05:37.320
Can you say dadda?

05:38.560 --> 05:40.560
- Dadda.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.400
- We should be doing this all the time.

05:48.280 --> 05:50.480
- Change of plans.

05:51.360 --> 05:53.220
Don't go to the zoo.

05:53.320 --> 05:54.060
- Don't ...

05:54.160 --> 05:57.660
- I would like you and
Chet Jr. to stay here.

05:57.760 --> 05:59.460
- Wait a second, honey you just ran us

05:59.560 --> 06:01.460
out of here two seconds ago.

06:01.560 --> 06:03.620
- Hey, look the truth
is, I'm still gonna be,

06:03.720 --> 06:07.000
hey enough seeping, out, go.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.020
I am still gonna be working 16 hours a day

06:10.120 --> 06:14.860
after I have the baby, so
this is a perfect opportunity

06:14.960 --> 06:15.860
to practise nailing this

06:15.960 --> 06:17.980
with the help of a
kick-ass nanny, of course.

06:18.080 --> 06:19.580
So what do you think?

06:19.680 --> 06:23.480
- Actually, here is perfect.

06:27.080 --> 06:29.080
- Okay.

06:30.720 --> 06:31.460
- [Faith] Rachel.

06:31.560 --> 06:32.300
- [Rachel] Hey, you're here.

06:32.400 --> 06:35.620
- I am so honoured that
you called me to come back

06:35.720 --> 06:36.620
and help out.

06:36.720 --> 06:37.460
- Yeah.

06:37.560 --> 06:38.980
- This story it's so important

06:39.080 --> 06:41.860
and I'm so thrilled that
you're finally telling it.

06:41.960 --> 06:44.460
- Yeah, you know we're
making a real stink in here,

06:44.560 --> 06:47.980
you know and you as a contestant
and licenced therapist now,

06:48.080 --> 06:50.020
you can really help my ass so I think

06:50.120 --> 06:50.860
- Rachel
it's just gonna be ...

06:50.960 --> 06:53.860
Wait, sometimes I look around at my life

06:53.960 --> 06:57.020
and I know that none of it
would have happened without you.

06:57.120 --> 06:58.300
- Oh it's really sweet Faith.
- No,

06:58.400 --> 07:02.020
seriously, a gorgeous
wife, sweet little home

07:02.120 --> 07:04.940
and the absolutely beautiful
relationship with God.

07:05.040 --> 07:07.020
- Yeah, I know, I think
that your Christmas cards

07:07.120 --> 07:08.100
are like next level cute attack

07:08.200 --> 07:09.300
Faith.
- Seriously, Rachel

07:09.400 --> 07:11.460
you let me come out in my own time

07:11.560 --> 07:13.980
in a respectful way to the people I love.

07:14.080 --> 07:17.080
I will always, always be
grateful for that, thank you.

07:18.720 --> 07:20.140
- Faith!

07:20.240 --> 07:21.180
- I love you.

07:21.280 --> 07:22.380
- Welcome home.
- I gotta go.

07:22.480 --> 07:23.900
- Hi friend.

07:24.000 --> 07:24.740
- Dan.
- [Dan] Hi.

07:24.840 --> 07:25.660
- Get rid of this.

07:25.760 --> 07:27.020
- [Dan] Far from here.

07:27.120 --> 07:27.820
- Must be my bonus.

07:27.920 --> 07:29.700
- I mean, this is amazing,

07:29.800 --> 07:33.060
you came to us as a straight
contestant in search of love

07:33.160 --> 07:35.940
and now you're a gay therapist
in search of crazy people,

07:36.040 --> 07:36.900
I am so proud.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.660
- Alright, don't even
start, you got Satan in you

07:39.760 --> 07:40.980
and I've always known that.

07:41.080 --> 07:43.100
I've been watching this
season of Everlasting

07:43.200 --> 07:44.260
and I am appalled.

07:44.360 --> 07:46.700
I'm actually surprised
that Rachel even stayed.

07:46.800 --> 07:47.940
I mean humper dump?

07:48.040 --> 07:49.420
It's only something that could have come

07:49.520 --> 07:52.540
from your sick, little mind.

07:52.640 --> 07:53.900
- Yeah, I'm the worst.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.060
- Yeah, so I will pray for
you but I don't work for you,

07:57.160 --> 08:00.040
I'm a professional counsellor
and I'm here to do my job.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.580
- I don't appreciate being kept waiting.

08:14.680 --> 08:16.580
- Well, this should make
it worth your while.

08:16.680 --> 08:18.500
You can know everything's
already been paid for

08:18.600 --> 08:20.700
including the hot stone massage.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.740
- I am doing this for my career, okay?

08:22.840 --> 08:24.540
Mark Zuckerberg and Justin
Trudeau will be there.

08:24.640 --> 08:27.020
- Yeah and I see strategic
partnerships being formed

08:27.120 --> 08:27.900
all over the place.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.820
- Look, just make sure
my baby's okay alright?

08:30.920 --> 08:32.860
Bozo Chett was denied custody for a reason

08:32.960 --> 08:34.500
and Quinn's so self-centered,
I wouldn't trust her

08:34.600 --> 08:35.860
to look after a fish.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.300
- Your baby is gonna be fine,

08:37.400 --> 08:38.980
I promise.
- Thank you.

08:39.080 --> 08:41.080
- So will Quinn.

08:48.200 --> 08:53.140
- All stars, your journey
is to find everlasting love

08:53.240 --> 08:56.700
and Everlasting a million
dollars has been arduous.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.940
No walk along the country road

08:59.040 --> 09:00.500
but you'll be southern comforted to know

09:00.600 --> 09:02.300
that you will be meeting a therapist

09:02.400 --> 09:05.540
who knows exactly what each
one of you is going through,

09:05.640 --> 09:08.100
a true Everlasting all star.

09:08.200 --> 09:09.420
Faith!

09:09.520 --> 09:11.140
- Hi guys.

09:11.240 --> 09:12.220
(applause)

09:12.320 --> 09:14.420
- Faith.

09:14.520 --> 09:16.580
- Maya, hi, oh my gosh.

09:16.680 --> 09:18.380
You all are so sweet.

09:18.480 --> 09:20.620
Oh, I am so excited to help you all

09:20.720 --> 09:23.940
navigate the raging waters
that are Everlasting

09:24.040 --> 09:27.500
and find true love, like I did.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.060
I mean, with Amy. (laughs)

09:29.160 --> 09:30.180
- Indeedy. (laughs)

09:30.280 --> 09:31.180
- Yeah.

09:31.280 --> 09:33.420
- Now this challenge, you guys will not

09:33.520 --> 09:34.380
be taxing physically,

09:34.480 --> 09:37.380
but it will be our toughest emotionally.

09:37.480 --> 09:39.220
Obviously, Faith is here to
lend an ear and her heart

09:39.320 --> 09:42.940
to help any of you that
may need to recover

09:43.040 --> 09:45.100
from any fallout.

09:45.200 --> 09:47.220
- I'm here to help you
with anything you all need,

09:47.320 --> 09:49.320
anything.

09:49.840 --> 09:52.060
- Alright, thank you Faith,
that being said, ladies,

09:52.160 --> 09:52.900
won't you follow me.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.300
- Does Faith even know what's coming?

09:54.400 --> 09:55.980
- Don't worry she trusts me.

09:56.080 --> 09:57.580
- She's not the same old bumpkin

09:57.680 --> 09:59.780
who came up in here
season 13, people change.

09:59.880 --> 10:01.300
- Hey, Quinn, these ladies
are here to see you.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.100
- Oh line them up.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.140
- Dropping in a new stripper?

10:04.240 --> 10:06.520
- I'm hiring a nanny thank you.

10:13.080 --> 10:16.340
Oh wait, you nannied for Sheryl Sanberg?

10:16.440 --> 10:19.220
- How do think she had
all that time to lean in?

10:19.320 --> 10:20.580
- You're hired.

10:20.680 --> 10:22.340
Thank you so much for your time,

10:22.440 --> 10:24.580
please get an Everlasting
water bottle from Graham

10:24.680 --> 10:25.420
on your way out.

10:25.520 --> 10:27.860
- Oh, you guys are gonna love Graham.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.220
- Follow me please into the chicken coop.

10:29.320 --> 10:33.180
Here's how this works, I'm gonna
ask these women a question,

10:33.280 --> 10:35.860
the answer will be one of them.

10:35.960 --> 10:38.220
Now rather than verbalise the answer,

10:38.320 --> 10:41.420
each woman is gonna
grab an egg and throw it

10:41.520 --> 10:44.140
at the woman that they
think is the right guest.

10:44.240 --> 10:47.580
Welcome to eggs marks the spot.

10:47.680 --> 10:51.020
- Congratulations on luring an
already impossibly low bore.

10:51.120 --> 10:54.220
- First question, which
woman did Rodrigo say

10:54.320 --> 10:58.660
uses her tongue like Picasso uses a brush?

10:58.760 --> 11:02.380
- Whoa, whoa, I mean come on,
this isn't about me right?

11:02.480 --> 11:04.620
- Look, no one if throwing their eggs.

11:04.720 --> 11:07.620
We can't afford another passport
to dance style screw up.

11:07.720 --> 11:09.700
- Just wait, it only takes one.

11:09.800 --> 11:10.980
- Let me restate the question.

11:11.080 --> 11:13.420
Which woman did Rodrigo say uses ...

11:13.520 --> 11:15.500
- Oh yes.
- There.

11:15.600 --> 11:16.420
(laughs)

11:16.520 --> 11:17.260
- [Speaker] Whoa.

11:17.360 --> 11:19.700
- Tongue like Picasso is totally Candy.

11:19.800 --> 11:22.320
Sorry honey, I don't think
he's talking about you.

11:24.440 --> 11:25.180
(upbeat western music)

11:25.280 --> 11:26.260
(hollers)

11:26.360 --> 11:29.600
- Well, she for sure has had
the most practise, right?

11:33.200 --> 11:36.140
- Sorry, I just think
that they might be right.

11:36.240 --> 11:38.320
- Oh, Maya, come on.

11:41.640 --> 11:43.660
- Yeah, I think that I'm
gonna pass on that one.

11:43.760 --> 11:45.340
- Ah, no, no, I never said that (mumbles)

11:45.440 --> 11:47.460
no one has a tongue like yours trust me.

11:47.560 --> 11:48.980
- Okay that's a challenge to the question.

11:49.080 --> 11:50.060
- What?

11:50.160 --> 11:51.240
- If only we could no
for sure, right Rodrigo?

11:51.320 --> 11:54.220
- Dan, I think it's time
for the monitor of truth,

11:54.320 --> 11:55.980
bring her out.

11:56.080 --> 12:00.860
- MOT tell us who's lively
mouth aroused Rodrigo?

12:00.960 --> 12:03.540
- It is I who has the
product tongue, right,

12:03.640 --> 12:08.260
but Candy Coco, ooh my god, I mean she.

12:08.360 --> 12:12.140
Yes, (foreign language)
she uses her tongue like

12:12.240 --> 12:14.660
Picasso uses a brush.

12:14.760 --> 12:17.140
Rachel, what are you
doing that was private?

12:17.240 --> 12:18.020
(laughs)

12:18.120 --> 12:19.820
(foreign language)

12:19.920 --> 12:21.980
Oh prom queen is pissed.

12:22.080 --> 12:23.140
- (laughs) Oh.

12:23.240 --> 12:25.300
- Okay now give me Maya,
we need to break that girl.

12:25.400 --> 12:28.580
- Which woman did Roger
say that he would only shag

12:28.680 --> 12:30.680
after a handle of gin?

12:32.360 --> 12:36.200
Who did August say would
benefit the most from therapy?

12:38.480 --> 12:42.400
Which girl did Rodrigo assume was asexual?

12:43.720 --> 12:46.820
Who does Roger think
would wind up living alone

12:46.920 --> 12:48.920
with eight cats?

12:51.880 --> 12:52.620
- Maya.
- Maya.

12:52.720 --> 12:53.460
- Maya.

12:53.560 --> 12:55.560
- Maya will end up living
alone with eight cats.

12:57.040 --> 12:59.460
- Let's get back to our final
three questions, let's hope

12:59.560 --> 13:02.060
they're not too hard.
- No, no more, stop!

13:02.160 --> 13:02.860
- [Graham] What?

13:02.960 --> 13:04.460
- Stop, what the hell our we doing?

13:04.560 --> 13:06.460
Why are we humiliating each
other because some shit

13:06.560 --> 13:08.700
the guys have said about us?

13:08.800 --> 13:09.780
Screw this.

13:09.880 --> 13:12.620
Alright ladies, who is the biggest slut?

13:12.720 --> 13:15.180
Roger, yeah Roger.

13:15.280 --> 13:16.820
Who has the smallest dick?

13:16.920 --> 13:19.260
Oh I don't know Rodrigo I see you!

13:19.360 --> 13:20.220
- Okay that's a lie, that's a lie,

13:20.320 --> 13:21.180
that's not true!
- Oh no Rodrigo,

13:21.280 --> 13:23.280
get over here!

13:23.880 --> 13:25.300
The most unsufferable is you Graham.

13:25.400 --> 13:26.820
- Oh come on, hey, I was ...

13:26.920 --> 13:27.680
- Please hit Graham, please
hit Graham, please hit Graham.

13:27.760 --> 13:29.300
Oh god!

13:29.400 --> 13:30.380
(exclaims)

13:30.480 --> 13:31.820
Yes, yes!

13:31.920 --> 13:34.260
- No more to the patriarchy!

13:34.360 --> 13:36.620
No more victimisation by creeps

13:36.720 --> 13:37.660
in power!
- Okay that's it,

13:37.760 --> 13:40.980
challenge is over the loser of
eggs marks the spot is Candy.

13:41.080 --> 13:43.260
And you are going home tonight.

13:43.360 --> 13:47.060
- Oh that's alright,
what network is not going

13:47.160 --> 13:48.980
to watch stripper queens am I right.

13:49.080 --> 13:51.300
They are going to bend over deep for her.

13:51.400 --> 13:52.780
And cut.

13:52.880 --> 13:57.380
- Rachel, Rachel what is this
eggs, private confessionals?

13:57.480 --> 13:59.020
This is, this is horrible.

13:59.120 --> 14:01.260
- You're not supposed to be in here.

14:01.360 --> 14:03.660
- Look, I know that using confessions

14:03.760 --> 14:05.500
might seem like a violation

14:05.600 --> 14:08.140
but this whole episode is about honesty.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.980
I mean, it would be so
much more embarrassing

14:10.080 --> 14:12.300
if these women didn't know
what was being said about them.

14:12.400 --> 14:15.820
- Oh my god, Rachel come on.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.540
I have good sense of
smell and this stinks.

14:17.640 --> 14:20.020
Oh this stinks, this stinks
like Quinn's bullcrap.

14:20.120 --> 14:20.860
- I can hear you.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.580
- She's not doing this for honesty,

14:22.680 --> 14:27.060
she's doing this to make
Maya look and feel pathetic.

14:27.160 --> 14:29.340
- Maya is not pathetic,

14:29.440 --> 14:32.960
she's a phoenix rising
from the ashes and you,

14:33.840 --> 14:35.840
you're gonna help her fly.

14:45.440 --> 14:47.060
- I know it looked like
me (foreign language)

14:47.160 --> 14:50.420
but it wasn't me, it was TV
me, TV Rodrigo, you understand?

14:50.520 --> 14:52.880
- I guess the camera adds
10 pounds of asshole.

14:58.120 --> 14:59.580
- How unseen was that?

14:59.680 --> 15:00.900
- Yeah, I won't be
eating eggs anytime soon,

15:01.000 --> 15:02.780
that I'll tell you.

15:02.880 --> 15:04.780
- Hey, listen man since you're my guy,

15:04.880 --> 15:06.420
we should talk strategy,

15:06.520 --> 15:09.780
how to getting you into the
finals now that Candy's gone.

15:09.880 --> 15:12.140
- Yeah, actually, Tommy I've
kind of gone back to Rachel

15:12.240 --> 15:14.900
as my producer mate and
yeah we talked strategy

15:15.000 --> 15:16.020
this morning so.

15:16.120 --> 15:18.820
- Wait, wait, you talked
to Rachel this morning.

15:18.920 --> 15:21.460
- Yeah, basics, nothing more

15:21.560 --> 15:24.280
but anyway I really
appreciate your help, cheers.

15:30.680 --> 15:34.300
- Listen, Candy, I really
admire what you did back there.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.960
You spoke the truth about this place.

15:38.160 --> 15:42.000
You know, I'm sad that you're leaving.

15:43.960 --> 15:46.520
And I'm a little bit jealous

15:48.320 --> 15:50.320
but I'm sorry to see you go.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.520
- You're a really good guy.

15:58.080 --> 16:00.680
I'm sorry, I just thought
that you should know that.

16:03.160 --> 16:05.540
- I want Maya flown in the
second she's out of the shower

16:05.640 --> 16:06.500
and dressed.

16:06.600 --> 16:07.340
- [Speaker] Copy that.

16:07.440 --> 16:08.780
- So you're back with August?

16:08.880 --> 16:10.880
- Yeah, I am.

16:11.360 --> 16:13.500
- Alright, you wanna go radio
silence on your personal life,

16:13.600 --> 16:16.360
fine just tell me who I
should be producing then.

16:17.240 --> 16:20.240
- Right, because that's what
this is about, producing.

16:21.280 --> 16:23.380
Are you having fun producing
the shit out of Madison?

16:23.480 --> 16:26.260
- Not as much fun as you had riding Jack.

16:26.360 --> 16:30.060
Next time maybe throw
a towel onto the camera

16:30.160 --> 16:32.840
or did you want me to see?

16:35.040 --> 16:37.960
- Well, I thought that you
don't shit where you eat so.

16:38.920 --> 16:40.340
- I mean, that's a soft rule,

16:40.440 --> 16:46.240
more of a theory than a policy, I think.
Why Rachel?

16:48.720 --> 16:50.720
- Dude don't do this right now okay?

16:51.800 --> 16:53.060
I have to get that
Faith and Maya interview

16:53.160 --> 16:55.160
and I need you on Roger.

16:56.480 --> 16:58.480
- Copy that.

17:00.040 --> 17:02.380
- I'm so sorry Maya, we can pull the plug

17:02.480 --> 17:03.540
on this right now if you want to.

17:03.640 --> 17:06.860
- That is not what we
want Dr. Reba McEntire.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.980
- I wanna talk about why
I'm not the same person

17:09.080 --> 17:11.420
I used to be, I need to get this out.

17:11.520 --> 17:16.300
- You can start by maybe talking
to some of the other women.

17:16.400 --> 17:18.780
The bonds of sisterhood are mighty strong.

17:18.880 --> 17:21.060
- Maya's ready to pop her rape cord.

17:21.160 --> 17:23.540
- God, none of this should
even be on television,

17:23.640 --> 17:25.020
you do realise this, right?

17:25.120 --> 17:26.060
- Oh boy.

17:26.160 --> 17:27.700
- I mean okay, yeah, Faith
may have had a good experience

17:27.800 --> 17:29.300
but just as easily could have turned into

17:29.400 --> 17:31.060
a complete shit show.

17:31.160 --> 17:32.540
- So what do you want?

17:32.640 --> 17:35.540
You want her to just stay
silent, hide what happened.

17:35.640 --> 17:37.540
You're the problem, this is the problem.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.260
- If you're happy is (mumbles).

17:39.360 --> 17:40.100
- [Quinn] What?

17:40.200 --> 17:41.660
- What are you doing shooting
Everlasting Toddlers?

17:41.760 --> 17:44.140
- I'm recording memories with my son.

17:44.240 --> 17:45.780
- Where is the nanny.

17:45.880 --> 17:46.980
- Put her on break.

17:47.080 --> 17:48.300
- No, she's not a factory worker,

17:48.400 --> 17:51.340
she is a full-time baby watcher, alright?

17:51.440 --> 17:53.700
Hey, Sadie, where the hell are you?

17:53.800 --> 17:55.340
- Hey Quinn, if you wanna
spend your time with Chet Jr.,

17:55.440 --> 17:56.820
I got this whole Maya thing covered.

17:56.920 --> 17:58.660
- No, I'm not gonna
miss this for anything,

17:58.760 --> 18:01.380
especially not for some
sticky fingered snot factory.

18:01.480 --> 18:03.500
- Hey, Quinn you said you
wanted to do this together.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.600
Okay.
- There you go.

18:06.960 --> 18:07.940
- Gonna (mumbles) so cute.

18:08.040 --> 18:09.300
- Really, really?

18:09.400 --> 18:10.140
- Just get a nice two.

18:10.240 --> 18:10.980
- Not you okay.

18:11.080 --> 18:12.980
- Oh that's beautiful.

18:13.080 --> 18:14.780
- Okay yay, look at us,
it's family bonding.

18:14.880 --> 18:17.220
Ah Sadie, isn't it time
for him to take a nap?

18:17.320 --> 18:19.260
- Yes, come now baby.
- Great, okay.

18:19.360 --> 18:20.740
- That's okay, follow
me, we'll get some shots

18:20.840 --> 18:21.940
in the throne room.

18:22.040 --> 18:23.180
Come on, hurry up, hurry up.

18:23.280 --> 18:25.740
Come on, let's hurry.
- Come on now darling.

18:25.840 --> 18:29.220
- Okay, I want Roger locked in the stocks

18:29.320 --> 18:32.780
with pissed off women pummeling
him with rotten fruit.

18:32.880 --> 18:34.700
- Ooh, I love that, this is
your night, I'm telling you,

18:34.800 --> 18:35.580
your night.

18:35.680 --> 18:37.340
- Okay, we're excited.

18:37.440 --> 18:38.380
Here we go!

18:38.480 --> 18:41.260
- Hello ladies, I know
that everyone's feeling

18:41.360 --> 18:44.540
just a little bit raw
after the egg stoning

18:44.640 --> 18:47.740
but Maya has something
that she wants to share

18:47.840 --> 18:50.240
that I think could lead
to some genuine healing.

18:53.520 --> 18:56.260
- So it's about Roger, he's not exactly

18:56.360 --> 18:59.980
the fun-loving good guy
that you guys think he is.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.900
He's not a good guy at all.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.980
I know this because of what
he did to me during my season.

19:05.080 --> 19:05.820
- What, what did he do?

19:05.920 --> 19:06.900
What happened?

19:07.000 --> 19:08.580
- Let's get this party started, shall we?

19:08.680 --> 19:10.680
Tommy can we fly in our guest please?

19:12.680 --> 19:16.020
- Roger, let me grab you
real quick we're gonna reel.

19:16.120 --> 19:18.820
- Of course, there's no egg
on my face, right? (laughs)

19:18.920 --> 19:23.920
- I was drunk and he took me to some room.

19:25.160 --> 19:28.540
It was dark, I could barely even stand up

19:28.640 --> 19:31.680
and he had his hands
all over me, I mean ...

19:32.600 --> 19:34.980
- [Faith] Roger could you
give us some privacy please?

19:35.080 --> 19:35.840
- [Noelle] No, no, no,
Maya was just telling us

19:35.920 --> 19:38.660
what you did to her.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.220
- Sorry, did what?

19:40.320 --> 19:42.060
I mean, what are you talking about?

19:42.160 --> 19:45.600
- Okay, go on Maya, tell
us exactly what you mean.

19:50.720 --> 19:52.540
- Maya, we talked about this

19:52.640 --> 19:55.060
or at least I tried to
talk to you, last night,

19:55.160 --> 19:58.100
when we stayed in the
same room in the same bed.

19:58.200 --> 20:01.580
If you had something to say to
me why didn't you say it then

20:01.680 --> 20:03.980
because this feels like a witch hunt,

20:04.080 --> 20:05.740
like, you were just
waiting for the cameras

20:05.840 --> 20:06.780
to do a TV moment.

20:06.880 --> 20:08.740
- [Maya] No, no, that's
not what this is about.

20:08.840 --> 20:11.060
- Maybe, you just feel guilty we hooked up

20:11.160 --> 20:12.860
because you were supposed
to be on the show for Adam.

20:12.960 --> 20:14.660
- Wait, what, you cheated on the suitor?

20:14.760 --> 20:15.500
- [Woman] What?

20:15.600 --> 20:18.340
- Excuse me, no, I did
not cheat on the suitor.

20:18.440 --> 20:22.260
You have no idea what
my life has been like

20:22.360 --> 20:23.620
since I left the show.

20:23.720 --> 20:25.540
- You didn't leave the
show after we got together,

20:25.640 --> 20:27.260
you stayed over three more weeks.

20:27.360 --> 20:30.180
You only left after that poor
woman Mary killed herself.

20:30.280 --> 20:33.180
Which granted, must have been
terribly traumatic for you.

20:33.280 --> 20:35.500
- Why is this criminal
sounding reasonable Rachel?

20:35.600 --> 20:37.620
- [Faith] Maya, you can tell your truth.

20:37.720 --> 20:40.940
- What is the truth, you know what listen,

20:41.040 --> 20:42.940
my life changed a lot
too when I left the show

20:43.040 --> 20:46.260
but I took responsibility
and bettered myself.

20:46.360 --> 20:47.980
You can't just blame everything on men,

20:48.080 --> 20:50.080
it's just bad for women.

20:50.640 --> 20:55.300
- Look Maya, you're making
some pretty big accusations

20:55.400 --> 20:58.500
and I wanna believe you but
what are you trying to say?

20:58.600 --> 21:00.300
- He raped you just say it you coward!

21:00.400 --> 21:02.400
- Rachel.

21:04.160 --> 21:06.140
- Maya isn't a liar,
(baby crying)

21:06.240 --> 21:07.500
okay she's great.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.640
But I know what this show does to people,

21:08.720 --> 21:12.780
you know, the producers
and their mind tricks,

21:12.880 --> 21:14.660
being trapped here like this.

21:14.760 --> 21:18.460
It's hard to tell what
is real and what is not.

21:18.560 --> 21:19.300
- No.

21:19.400 --> 21:23.740
- Okay, so let's give Maya her
space and she'll sort it out.

21:23.840 --> 21:25.420
- No, no, no!

21:25.520 --> 21:27.580
- Okay, you know what, this
is not fireworks, alright.

21:27.680 --> 21:30.660
I have rape revenged
blue balls and they suck.

21:30.760 --> 21:32.620
Sadie make it stop!

21:32.720 --> 21:34.340
- Karma has entered the building.

21:34.440 --> 21:37.900
- This was our whole
episode, your whole season.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.020
We've been building to this since day one,

21:40.120 --> 21:41.540
so what the hell happened Rachel?

21:41.640 --> 21:42.540
- You think I don't know that?

21:42.640 --> 21:44.420
I busted my ass for this moment

21:44.520 --> 21:47.380
and I am not gonna let
some weak damaged pussy

21:47.480 --> 21:49.480
take it away from me okay!

21:50.480 --> 21:52.480
This is my moment, it's mine!

21:53.360 --> 21:56.120
(dramatic music)

22:06.480 --> 22:08.420
Maya, hey let's talk about this, okay?

22:08.520 --> 22:10.420
I can still get Roger,
I can get the girls,

22:10.520 --> 22:11.340
we can still do this.

22:11.440 --> 22:13.100
- Foot off the gas there Rach,

22:13.200 --> 22:15.180
I think Maya needs some
time to regroup, okay?

22:15.280 --> 22:17.280
- I'm sorry Rachel.

22:19.720 --> 22:21.340
I'm so sorry.

22:21.440 --> 22:24.140
- No, of course, yeah,
you two should talk.

22:24.240 --> 22:26.240
Faith will know what to say.

22:28.880 --> 22:30.880
- Rach, how's it goin'?

22:31.520 --> 22:34.000
- Not now Jack.

22:36.120 --> 22:38.260
- Look, Rachel may think
that she can pull this off

22:38.360 --> 22:39.420
but I need a plan B

22:39.520 --> 22:42.540
so that I can deliver
60 minutes of something.

22:42.640 --> 22:44.500
Oh my god again, how do people do this

22:44.600 --> 22:45.780
with the crying all the time?

22:45.880 --> 22:48.000
- I got you boss, I'll figure it out.

22:49.600 --> 22:50.700
(baby crying)

22:50.800 --> 22:52.500
- What the hell Sadie?

22:52.600 --> 22:56.220
Are you deaf or incompetent,
go in there and make him stop.

22:56.320 --> 22:57.940
- He needs to learn self-soothing.

22:58.040 --> 23:02.220
- I do not pay you $400 bucks
a day to sit on your ass,

23:02.320 --> 23:05.380
when he cries you soothe.

23:05.480 --> 23:07.580
- This is how bad habits are formed.

23:07.680 --> 23:09.740
I'm not doing that to the child.

23:09.840 --> 23:12.180
- Yeah, you know I
really wish I didn't have

23:12.280 --> 23:16.300
this one bad habit of
firing people but I do.

23:16.400 --> 23:18.020
You're fired!

23:18.120 --> 23:20.540
- I'm going to pray for that little one

23:20.640 --> 23:23.240
because you are clueless with children.

23:24.080 --> 23:25.340
I hate the show too.

23:25.440 --> 23:27.960
(baby crying)

23:29.280 --> 23:32.240
- Please, soothe yourself
I am begging you!

23:33.880 --> 23:35.820
Where is Chet!

23:35.920 --> 23:38.800
- Now which one does Mommy drink?

23:44.880 --> 23:47.020
- Why am I watching this shit?

23:47.120 --> 23:49.180
- I'm gonna show this video to the judge

23:49.280 --> 23:52.460
in my petition for
partial custody of my son.

23:52.560 --> 23:55.460
Along with your testimony
that when Cynthia dropped

23:55.560 --> 23:58.260
little Chetty off, you
smelled alcohol on her breath.

23:58.360 --> 23:59.620
- Dude, I don't have time for this.

23:59.720 --> 24:00.820
- I think you do.

24:00.920 --> 24:03.900
I did a little digging and I found out

24:04.000 --> 24:07.300
how Cynthia got into the Creo-Lux Retreat.

24:07.400 --> 24:09.140
Turns out it was you.

24:09.240 --> 24:11.820
- Yeah, I wanted Quinn to have a glimpse

24:11.920 --> 24:13.340
into the reality of her situation.

24:13.440 --> 24:16.180
- Yeah, well here's the
reality of your situation,

24:16.280 --> 24:19.100
you're gonna testify for
me or I'm gonna tell Quinn

24:19.200 --> 24:21.820
that you're not on
board with her pregnancy

24:21.920 --> 24:23.940
but are conspiring to destroy it.

24:24.040 --> 24:25.940
Thought there was some
lines even little weirdo

24:26.040 --> 24:30.380
wouldn't cross, like screwing
over your best friend.

24:30.480 --> 24:32.380
- I'm not screwing her over,
I'm trying to help her.

24:32.480 --> 24:35.180
- Quinn's gonna be an amazing mom.

24:35.280 --> 24:37.520
- Yeah, we'll see.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.140
- Please, just could you touch

24:41.240 --> 24:43.820
someone else for once, alright.

24:43.920 --> 24:46.180
I am not a firetruck, this is a firetruck.

24:46.280 --> 24:48.400
Have you seen Chet?

24:49.320 --> 24:51.320
- No, not since this morning.

24:51.960 --> 24:53.060
- What is this?

24:53.160 --> 24:55.700
- I'm letting Faith do her whole
like kumbaya thing with Mya

24:55.800 --> 24:57.660
and then it's my turn.

24:57.760 --> 24:59.260
I'm not gonna let her off the hook.

24:59.360 --> 25:01.540
- Well, while you go down
with your worthless ship,

25:01.640 --> 25:04.020
I told Tommy to come up with
something else for the day.

25:04.120 --> 25:05.460
- Okay, yeah, I mean,
like, do whatever you want,

25:05.560 --> 25:07.740
I'm getting this confrontation so.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.700
- Come on, Rachel, alright, we know

25:09.800 --> 25:11.800
that this isn't really about Maya.

25:15.640 --> 25:17.460
Oh, wait, hey, what are you
doing, what are you doing?

25:17.560 --> 25:18.820
Don't touch those,
don't touch those, okay.

25:18.920 --> 25:19.660
Here we go.

25:19.760 --> 25:22.100
Oh crap, oh crap, is that crap?

25:22.200 --> 25:22.940
- Oh god.

25:23.040 --> 25:25.380
- Please, please, tell AD
Dan, bring me some towels

25:25.480 --> 25:27.380
and a cage, okay?

25:27.480 --> 25:30.480
- Hey AD Dan, we need towels
and a cage in the control room.

25:31.440 --> 25:32.620
- (sighs) This is disgusting.

25:32.720 --> 25:33.820
- Okay, I got it.

25:33.920 --> 25:36.100
Oh, eww.

25:36.200 --> 25:37.020
- Yes.

25:37.120 --> 25:40.860
- Okay, we'll do a super
sexy Everlasting carnival.

25:40.960 --> 25:44.140
A games of skill, adventurous
booths, big prizes,

25:44.240 --> 25:45.100
lots of alcohol.

25:45.200 --> 25:47.660
- Okay, I'm sorry but we only
have seven contestants left.

25:47.760 --> 25:49.260
That sounds like a very grim carnival

25:49.360 --> 25:50.900
with only seven people.

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
- Okay, well, I'll round up some people.

25:54.120 --> 25:55.820
- Hey, Quinn, Rachel said
something about a cage

25:55.920 --> 25:57.220
but I, oh crap.

25:57.320 --> 25:58.080
- Please, please, please.
- (mumbles) it's all

25:58.160 --> 25:58.860
over your hands, wow.

25:58.960 --> 26:02.320
- Okay, Dan how many crew members you know

26:03.240 --> 26:06.000
that have families and kids
because I need to get a whole crap load

26:06.080 --> 26:08.180
of them here within an hour
for an Everlasting carnival.

26:08.280 --> 26:09.780
- Yeah, no, my wife and have two,

26:09.880 --> 26:12.620
she's actually nine months
pregnant so almost three.

26:12.720 --> 26:13.740
- Wait, you're married?

26:13.840 --> 26:16.380
- Yeah, I mean, oh hi.

26:16.480 --> 26:19.700
Yeah, we were separated but it's cool now.

26:19.800 --> 26:22.300
So, I mean, we weren't
together when we ...

26:22.400 --> 26:24.900
- Hey stop talking, your
wife is about to give birth?

26:25.000 --> 26:25.780
- Yeah.

26:25.880 --> 26:28.580
- Get her full bloom here immediately,

26:28.680 --> 26:30.300
now, go!
- But, I, do (mumbles)

26:30.400 --> 26:32.300
bad idea.
- Get out of here!

26:32.400 --> 26:33.140
- What's a bad idea?

26:33.240 --> 26:36.660
Whoa, that is not pudding.

26:36.760 --> 26:38.220
- Where have you been Chet father?

26:38.320 --> 26:41.180
I tried to feed him, change
him, sell him on Ebay.

26:41.280 --> 26:42.220
- Where's the nanny?

26:42.320 --> 26:45.300
- She was an idiot so
I fired her, alright.

26:45.400 --> 26:47.060
I just, I can't deal
with this, I can't ...

26:47.160 --> 26:51.420
- Alright, I will take
little Chetty, come on bub.

26:51.520 --> 26:55.540
- Oh god here, just take it, just take it.

26:55.640 --> 26:59.040
- Yeah, that's dooty, that's dooty, okay.

27:03.040 --> 27:05.620
- Hey, how's she doing?

27:05.720 --> 27:07.260
- Not good.

27:07.360 --> 27:12.140
Hey Jay, why did Quinn
send in Roger so soon.

27:12.240 --> 27:13.340
That was an ambush.

27:13.440 --> 27:16.240
- What, no Quinn had
nothing to do with that.

27:19.760 --> 27:21.100
Come here, come here.

27:21.200 --> 27:23.220
- Jake.

27:23.320 --> 27:27.380
- No one has had Maya's back
all season, you hear me?

27:27.480 --> 27:28.460
So, if you're really her friend

27:28.560 --> 27:30.640
you need to get her out of here right now.

27:32.040 --> 27:32.780
- What?

27:32.880 --> 27:34.920
- Jay, what are you doing?

27:40.520 --> 27:41.640
Where's Maya, is she
ready to confront Roger?

27:41.720 --> 27:43.540
- You know what, I think I'm
gonna take her out of here,

27:43.640 --> 27:44.620
this place isn't healthy for her.

27:44.720 --> 27:46.620
- No, you're not taking her anywhere.

27:46.720 --> 27:48.660
The only reason I brought
her back here is for this

27:48.760 --> 27:50.180
and the only reason I brought you back

27:50.280 --> 27:51.300
is to make sure she delivers.

27:51.400 --> 27:54.120
So why don't you go back in
there and do your job okay?

27:56.520 --> 28:01.520
- Oh my god, oh my god,
it's you, not Quinn.

28:04.920 --> 28:07.000
You were my super hero Rach.

28:09.200 --> 28:11.340
You know that, you protected me,

28:11.440 --> 28:15.020
you chose my happiness over ratings

28:15.120 --> 28:19.300
but I can't hold you in my
heart if you're gonna make

28:19.400 --> 28:23.360
your life's work destroying
women on national television.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.400
What happened to you?

28:26.760 --> 28:28.760
Seriously, what happened to you?

28:33.320 --> 28:35.320
- I don't know.

28:39.480 --> 28:41.480
Oh I should go apologise to Maya.

28:45.920 --> 28:47.920
Thanks Faith.

28:53.280 --> 28:56.000
(dramatic music)

29:15.680 --> 29:17.700
So you're running away huh?

29:17.800 --> 29:19.900
- That's not what's happening.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.500
- Makes sense, starting to think

29:22.600 --> 29:24.540
you were playing me this whole time.

29:24.640 --> 29:26.740
- Rachel, you know what happened?

29:26.840 --> 29:27.660
- Do I?

29:27.760 --> 29:28.820
- [Maya] Yes.

29:28.920 --> 29:29.780
- You say it was rape

29:29.880 --> 29:32.220
but I remember how you took your dress off

29:32.320 --> 29:33.780
at the table and seduced Roger.

29:33.880 --> 29:37.520
- It was a party, I didn't
know what was gonna happen!

29:40.320 --> 29:43.740
- Maybe it wasn't so
horrible, maybe you wanted it.

29:43.840 --> 29:46.660
- No, that is not true.

29:46.760 --> 29:49.220
- Okay, you know what it doesn't matter.

29:49.320 --> 29:50.820
If you leave now everyone's gonna think

29:50.920 --> 29:53.720
that Roger was right, that you were lying.

29:56.040 --> 29:58.040
Maybe that's the truth after all.

30:05.720 --> 30:06.820
(carnival music)

30:06.920 --> 30:10.940
- In Rio, carnival, is
the celebration of excess

30:11.040 --> 30:13.980
right before Lent and here in Everlasting,

30:14.080 --> 30:17.820
it is the celebration of
excess right before sent,

30:17.920 --> 30:22.180
as in sent home, which one
of you will be tonight.

30:22.280 --> 30:24.660
So have a good old fashioned fun time guys

30:24.760 --> 30:28.100
but don't lose track of the bigger contest

30:28.200 --> 30:31.480
because the ladies will be
watching you're every move.

30:32.520 --> 30:33.900
- What is he wearing?

30:34.000 --> 30:35.580
- I mean, seriously, someone should check

30:35.680 --> 30:38.300
the (mumbles) database to
see if he's registered.

30:38.400 --> 30:40.480
- Let the games begin.

30:41.480 --> 30:42.500
- This better work.

30:42.600 --> 30:44.600
- Oh my god look.

30:44.960 --> 30:46.300
What so Rachel got Maya to stay

30:46.400 --> 30:49.300
and what like just produced
Faith right on out of here.

30:49.400 --> 30:51.400
- She is so good, right?

30:52.760 --> 30:54.660
- There's a Carolyn here.

30:54.760 --> 30:59.760
- Alright, let's go.

31:01.680 --> 31:04.400
(carnival music)

31:08.880 --> 31:13.060
- Noelle, oh my god, you look
amazing, you look incredible.

31:13.160 --> 31:14.300
How's it going?
- Thank you.

31:14.400 --> 31:16.900
You know, been a stellar day.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.100
- I know, I know, those
Rodrigo testimonials,

31:19.200 --> 31:21.060
those must have hurt so much.

31:21.160 --> 31:23.820
Look, I'm sorry, okay,
I'm just doing my job.

31:23.920 --> 31:25.700
We're supposed to make
this whole thing a journey

31:25.800 --> 31:27.900
but really it is supposed to be fun.

31:28.000 --> 31:31.620
Bartender, you know
what do a shot with me,

31:31.720 --> 31:33.300
let's just loosen things up,

31:33.400 --> 31:34.380
let's just get this party started.

31:34.480 --> 31:35.220
Bartender!
- No, no, no, no,

31:35.320 --> 31:36.020
I don't think it's time,

31:36.120 --> 31:36.980
it's okay, I'm okay.

31:37.080 --> 31:38.020
- I don't think it'd be the worse thing

31:38.120 --> 31:39.140
to let them get some footage of you

31:39.240 --> 31:41.060
not being a stuck up pain in the ass.

31:41.160 --> 31:43.060
- Okay, that's not who I am.

31:43.160 --> 31:45.820
- Look, I know that but
we just have to make sure

31:45.920 --> 31:47.780
that's not the story that they're telling.

31:47.880 --> 31:50.680
Okay, so take a sip, drink
and have a good time.

31:53.920 --> 31:55.740
That's my girl, you're my
new favourite, I love you.

31:55.840 --> 31:57.580
Okay, come on, let's get
these drinks flowing.

31:57.680 --> 32:00.020
Bartender, drinks all around.

32:00.120 --> 32:03.620
- Yeah, oh hi, this is
Quinn this is Carolyn,

32:03.720 --> 32:04.460
Carolyn, Quinn.

32:04.560 --> 32:06.820
- Hi, so when did the
doctor say that this stuff

32:06.920 --> 32:07.700
was supposed to kick in.

32:07.800 --> 32:10.300
- I don't need much help, my
first one came in three hours

32:10.400 --> 32:12.460
and the second one, shot out in the subway

32:12.560 --> 32:13.380
on the way to the hospital.

32:13.480 --> 32:15.460
- I absolutely would have sprung for a cab

32:15.560 --> 32:16.420
but I thought we had more time.

32:16.520 --> 32:17.940
- I hope that he told you
that for your trouble,

32:18.040 --> 32:20.380
we'll happily cover this kid's
freshmen year of college.

32:20.480 --> 32:21.780
- I don't think so.

32:21.880 --> 32:24.620
You're gonna cover all
four years plus travel.

32:24.720 --> 32:27.020
And you're gonna find
Danny's Indie features

32:27.120 --> 32:28.500
so he has no more excuses.

32:28.600 --> 32:30.420
- That seems a little excessive.

32:30.520 --> 32:32.460
- Daniel, call me a cab, we're going.

32:32.560 --> 32:36.160
- What okay, fine, fine, it's a deal.

32:37.480 --> 32:40.100
And America has a little art
house straight to video jam

32:40.200 --> 32:42.500
coming your way, yippie, great.

32:42.600 --> 32:44.600
Get her into hair and makeup, go.

32:45.680 --> 32:47.900
- You cannot be serious with this?

32:48.000 --> 32:50.580
- Oh come on, alright, I
have paramedics on call,

32:50.680 --> 32:52.220
one of our contestants is a paediatrician

32:52.320 --> 32:53.180
what could go wrong?

32:53.280 --> 32:55.260
- God, this place is out of control.

32:55.360 --> 32:57.780
- Exactly, I have a woman
who's about to give birth

32:57.880 --> 32:59.300
so I need all hands on deck.

32:59.400 --> 33:01.440
I want her crowning by midnight, come on.

33:03.800 --> 33:06.500
- Hey, I just, I wanted to check in

33:06.600 --> 33:08.220
and make sure that
you're cool after today.

33:08.320 --> 33:11.020
I mean, like, honestly, I had no idea

33:11.120 --> 33:13.220
that Maya was gonna pull that rape shit.

33:13.320 --> 33:14.780
- Yeah, well, I'm fairly
set that tonight's

33:14.880 --> 33:15.980
my Everlasting finale

33:16.080 --> 33:18.380
because none of the girls
are gonna pick me now.

33:18.480 --> 33:20.940
- I wouldn't be so sure.

33:21.040 --> 33:24.900
I thought that you came off
honest, heartfelt empathetic,

33:25.000 --> 33:26.540
if anything what happened today made

33:26.640 --> 33:28.660
you seem like a better guy.

33:28.760 --> 33:30.760
- That's what you're
supposed to tell me right?

33:31.160 --> 33:33.560
- Well, here's something that
I'm not supposed to tell you.

33:34.880 --> 33:37.940
The person who is really
taken with you is Noelle.

33:38.040 --> 33:39.300
- Really?

33:39.400 --> 33:42.700
- Oh, yeah, yeah, she
is like so over Rodrigo,

33:42.800 --> 33:45.700
she thinks your twice
the gentleman than he is.

33:45.800 --> 33:49.180
If I were you, I'd make a move.

33:49.280 --> 33:52.040
(dramatic music)

33:57.320 --> 33:59.020
- I think I'm gonna do it all handheld,

33:59.120 --> 33:59.900
like, cinema (mumbles) style.

34:00.000 --> 34:00.980
- Oh, I can't wait not to see it.

34:01.080 --> 34:03.260
- Oh come on, you're not gonna see it?

34:03.360 --> 34:04.740
You okay babe?

34:04.840 --> 34:07.180
- My water broke while I
was sitting on the toilet.

34:07.280 --> 34:08.620
- Oh gross.

34:08.720 --> 34:10.820
- No, off camera, no
that's not gonna work.

34:10.920 --> 34:12.100
- Someone get me special effects.

34:12.200 --> 34:13.580
- [Quinn] Yes.

34:13.680 --> 34:15.860
- Look at you superstar.

34:15.960 --> 34:18.260
(foreign language)

34:18.360 --> 34:20.620
- I'm gonna win one for
Noelle, one for Sophia,

34:20.720 --> 34:22.620
one for Maya and one for Candy too.

34:22.720 --> 34:25.140
I'm gonna send it to her,
make everything good again.

34:25.240 --> 34:27.820
- I don't think you need to try so hard.

34:27.920 --> 34:29.220
I mean, you're Rodrigo.

34:29.320 --> 34:32.860
- Yes, you're right, this
is what I'm thinking also.

34:32.960 --> 34:34.900
- I have to tell you something.

34:35.000 --> 34:38.720
I didn't bring you back
here for the other girls.

34:40.040 --> 34:41.780
I brought you back here for me.

34:41.880 --> 34:43.500
- Rachel.

34:43.600 --> 34:44.540
- I've been trying to stay away

34:44.640 --> 34:46.760
but I just can't hold out any longer.

34:48.680 --> 34:50.700
- For you.

34:50.800 --> 34:52.800
- That's all you got for me?

35:00.080 --> 35:02.160
(laughs)

35:03.680 --> 35:07.580
(mumbles) think it's so ...

35:07.680 --> 35:09.680
You know, what I'm so sorry, I will,

35:10.520 --> 35:11.900
I'll just leave you two alone.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.500
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, you go, go.

35:14.600 --> 35:17.000
You stay, right here.

35:19.960 --> 35:22.740
You are having an affair with a contestant

35:22.840 --> 35:25.740
and I know that is
absolutely against the rules.

35:25.840 --> 35:29.340
- Noelle, I am not having an
affair with Rodrigo, okay,

35:29.440 --> 35:31.900
I'm just lubing him up for
the party, I'm producing him.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.940
- Right, producing him to love you.

35:34.040 --> 35:36.540
- Dude, this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

35:36.640 --> 35:38.300
It's this kind of raging insecurity

35:38.400 --> 35:41.460
that made Rodrigo cut you and
choose Stephanie in season 10.

35:41.560 --> 35:44.420
- Girl, you did not
just mention Stephanie.

35:44.520 --> 35:46.420
- You just need to stop
obsessing over a guy

35:46.520 --> 35:49.160
that's already rejected you, move on.

35:50.840 --> 35:52.140
What about Roger?

35:52.240 --> 35:52.980
- No.
- Why?

35:53.080 --> 35:56.020
- No, no, no, not after all
that stuff Maya said about him.

35:56.120 --> 35:58.820
- Dude that bitch is
crazy, we both know it.

35:58.920 --> 36:02.300
And besides Roger is very pro-woman,

36:02.400 --> 36:07.400
he would make a great partner
and honestly he's into you.

36:09.120 --> 36:09.860
- He is?

36:09.960 --> 36:11.180
- Oh yeah, yeah.

36:11.280 --> 36:14.220
I mean if anything else
just make Rodrigo jealous.

36:14.320 --> 36:15.980
I mean you've been playing hard to get,

36:16.080 --> 36:18.080
why not take it all the way?

36:22.520 --> 36:24.820
- And you, just the person I wanted.

36:24.920 --> 36:29.160
- Hey. (laughs)

36:32.320 --> 36:33.060
- Hey.

36:33.160 --> 36:33.900
- Hey.

36:34.000 --> 36:36.200
- It looks like Noelle's about to
smoot the jolly Roger.

36:36.280 --> 36:37.900
- Oh, that little slut.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
Poor Maya.

36:41.280 --> 36:44.900
- Good news is, Rodrigo's now free

36:45.000 --> 36:46.620
and I'm really thinking
that you should upgrade

36:46.720 --> 36:49.620
from the paediatrician to an
international soccer star.

36:49.720 --> 36:51.260
I mean, not bad for a night's work, right?

36:51.360 --> 36:54.020
- Yes, my god you are amazing Rachel.

36:54.120 --> 36:56.340
- Yes I am.
- You're the best.

36:56.440 --> 36:57.660
- I am the best.

36:57.760 --> 37:00.140
(laughs)

37:00.240 --> 37:02.300
(screaming)

37:02.400 --> 37:03.100
- What is that?

37:03.200 --> 37:05.200
- Somebody call a doctor!

37:07.920 --> 37:09.920
- My water broke!

37:10.960 --> 37:12.420
- What is this?

37:12.520 --> 37:14.860
- It's my hail Mary to save the show.

37:14.960 --> 37:17.580
I told rigger Dave that I
wanted a normal water break

37:17.680 --> 37:20.320
not Niagara Falls, so
much for subtly right?

37:28.000 --> 37:31.600
Alright, come on, let's
go clean this mess up.

37:39.320 --> 37:41.540
- (laughs) Give me a second (mumbles).

37:41.640 --> 37:42.900
- And you're complaining about a shoe.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.900
(mumbles)

37:45.000 --> 37:50.000
- Fun (mumbles) how do you
wake him up, wake up, wake up,

37:50.640 --> 37:55.080
wake up. (laughs)

38:01.000 --> 38:05.000
- Too bad, you had your chance.

38:07.520 --> 38:09.520
This is what happens.

38:16.200 --> 38:19.160
Come with me right now,
shit's about to blow.

38:24.120 --> 38:27.100
- The games of chance have
turned into the game of life.

38:27.200 --> 38:29.500
As three of our contestants
are helping deliver

38:29.600 --> 38:31.420
an actual woman's baby.

38:31.520 --> 38:34.340
A miracle of birth will show
the women here at Everlasting

38:34.440 --> 38:35.300
just how the men will do

38:35.400 --> 38:37.580
under the most intense circumstances

38:37.680 --> 38:39.880
and maybe even answer
the ultimate question

38:40.880 --> 38:42.140
is there a stud in the house?

38:42.240 --> 38:44.380
- It's all good, so
look, I learned to do it

38:44.480 --> 38:45.220
from the Botswani tribe,

38:45.320 --> 38:46.580
I mean, they're amazing people okay.

38:46.680 --> 38:48.660
So what I want you to do
is just hold your breath,

38:48.760 --> 38:50.580
now spread your knees as far as you can

38:50.680 --> 38:53.660
and just imagine the widest
tunnel you've ever seen.

38:53.760 --> 38:54.500
That's okay.

38:54.600 --> 38:55.700
- Or you can listen to a medical doctor

38:55.800 --> 38:57.980
who's seen real patients
in an actual hospital.

38:58.080 --> 38:59.620
(screams)

38:59.720 --> 39:01.720
- Everybody out, out.

39:08.360 --> 39:11.200
Okay, come on Maya, where are you?

39:12.120 --> 39:15.180
(screaming)

39:15.280 --> 39:16.940
- Why isn't anybody paying attention to,

39:17.040 --> 39:19.940
oh my god, that is way too real.

39:20.040 --> 39:23.220
- Wait did she just shit herself? (laughs)

39:23.320 --> 39:26.140
No, she did not just shit herself.

39:26.240 --> 39:28.540
Okay, I'm sorry, I'm out, I can't, nope.

39:28.640 --> 39:30.640
I can't do it.

39:31.760 --> 39:33.760
- Where's Maya, she was following them?

39:35.160 --> 39:37.160
- Whoa, dizzy.

39:37.880 --> 39:39.900
- How'd you get sound in there?

39:40.000 --> 39:42.000
- Oh, where is she?

39:43.280 --> 39:45.280
- Oh, dizzy.

39:45.960 --> 39:47.960
- It's okay.

39:54.280 --> 39:56.540
- Holy shit Rachel, she is really drunk

39:56.640 --> 39:58.640
are you sure this is ...

40:01.080 --> 40:01.780
Rachel?

40:01.880 --> 40:04.640
- Just wait, there she is.

40:11.040 --> 40:12.620
Come on Maya, go in there.

40:12.720 --> 40:14.720
- Oh my god.

40:15.320 --> 40:16.260
- You shit yourself,

40:16.360 --> 40:20.180
I had no idea that you
shit yourself. (laughs)

40:20.280 --> 40:23.460
Rachel, what the hell is going on?

40:23.560 --> 40:25.580
Is she even conscious?

40:25.680 --> 40:28.220
- Oh we have to stop him.

40:28.320 --> 40:29.020
Rachel!

40:29.120 --> 40:30.580
- No, this is it, this is Maya's moment,

40:30.680 --> 40:32.420
we have to let her have it.

40:32.520 --> 40:33.380
- Oh my god.

40:33.480 --> 40:35.420
- No this is sick, I'm
gonna go stop it right now.

40:35.520 --> 40:37.820
- No, she's almost there, she's going in.

40:37.920 --> 40:39.920
- Get off of her, now!

40:41.440 --> 40:42.420
(hollers)

40:42.520 --> 40:43.260
- Oh you crazy bitch!

40:43.360 --> 40:45.520
(screams)

40:48.280 --> 40:50.620
Help me, oh god, call 911!

40:50.720 --> 40:53.040
(screaming)

40:57.400 --> 41:00.100
- Breath, breathe are you okay?

41:00.200 --> 41:02.200
It's okay, it's okay ...

41:03.200 --> 41:04.940
- I'm gonna get another camera in there.

41:05.040 --> 41:07.040
- Oh my god.

41:09.280 --> 41:11.100
- Tommy get some close ups on Maya's face

41:11.200 --> 41:13.200
and don't forget the blood okay?

41:17.360 --> 41:19.360
What?

41:20.080 --> 41:21.340
(baby crying)

41:21.440 --> 41:22.780
- What the hell is going
on down here making noise,

41:22.880 --> 41:25.720
I'm trying to get him to down
and with all this screaming ...

41:26.880 --> 41:28.340
Oh god, I'm going in there.

41:28.440 --> 41:31.260
- Please, I need an ambulance,
we've had an accident,

41:31.360 --> 41:34.320
I am so scared. (sobbing)

41:35.480 --> 41:38.340
(baby crying)

41:38.440 --> 41:41.200
(dramatic music)
