WEBVTT

00:07.723 --> 00:09.724
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
WITH THE CLARK BAR?

00:09.792 --> 00:11.559
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
A SNICKERS MAN.

00:11.627 --> 00:14.362
OH. I DELIVERED
TO AN ED CLARK TODAY,

00:14.430 --> 00:17.365
AND, WELL, ONE THING
LED TO ANOTHER.

00:19.301 --> 00:23.922
ANY CHANCE YOU MIGHT DELIVER
TO A STEVE CELERY SOMETIME?

00:23.989 --> 00:27.358
ANY CHANCE YOU COULD
DELIVER TO SHUTTY TOWN?

00:29.762 --> 00:31.630
I USED TO LOVE THESE
AS A KID.

00:31.697 --> 00:33.832
MMM.

00:33.900 --> 00:36.367
ACTUALLY STOLE ONE
ONCE.

00:36.435 --> 00:37.702
YOU STOLE?

00:37.770 --> 00:39.604
YEP. I WAS AT HERB'S CANDIES ONE DAY.

00:39.671 --> 00:41.639
I CAME UP
A DIME SHORT,

00:41.707 --> 00:43.641
SO I JUST PUT ONE
IN MY POCKET,

00:43.709 --> 00:45.810
SLIPPED OUT THE FRONT DOOR AND ATE IT.

00:45.878 --> 00:48.512
5 MINUTES LATER, I FELT SO
GUILTY I THREW IT ALL UP.

00:50.116 --> 00:52.650
AND YET YOU GOT BACK
ON THE HORSE.

00:55.521 --> 00:57.789
HOW ABOUT YOU, YOU EVER STEAL ANYTHING?

00:57.856 --> 00:59.824
UH... ONCE
IN HIGH SCHOOL,

00:59.892 --> 01:01.993
A BUNCH OF US
STOLE A CAR.

01:08.284 --> 01:10.519
I'M SORRY?

01:11.587 --> 01:13.505
WELL, IF YOU WANT
TO BE TECHNICAL,

01:13.573 --> 01:16.074
IT WAS MORE OF
A CARJACKING.

01:16.142 --> 01:19.244
THE, UH, THE SHOP TEACHER
MR. PESHKIN

01:19.312 --> 01:21.313
WAS GONNA FAIL
A BUNCH OF US,

01:21.380 --> 01:22.947
SO WE WAITED FOR HIM
AFTER SCHOOL, AND, UM,

01:23.015 --> 01:25.200
WHEN HE WAS CLIMBING
INTO HIS CRAPPY OLD BUICK,

01:25.267 --> 01:27.318
MY FRIEND JIMMY
CAME UP BEHIND HIM,

01:27.386 --> 01:29.320
AND HE WAS, LIKE,
"GET DOWN! GET DOWN!"

01:29.388 --> 01:31.172
LIKE HE HAD A GUN
OR SOMETHING.

01:31.323 --> 01:33.825
SO MR. PESHKIN, HE JUST
DROPPED TO THE PAVEMENT,

01:33.893 --> 01:36.627
AND WE JUST ALL PILED
IN HIS CAR AND TOOK OFF.

01:36.695 --> 01:38.213
HE NEVER SAW US.

01:38.280 --> 01:40.147
BUT THEN LATER ON, WE STARTED
FREAKING OUT ABOUT FINGERPRINTS,

01:40.216 --> 01:42.149
SO WE STRIPPED
THE LICENSE PLATES

01:42.218 --> 01:44.586
AND PUSHED THE CAR
INTO THE RIVER.

01:44.653 --> 01:48.556
IT'S CRAZY THE STUFF
YOU DO AS A KID, RIGHT?

01:50.000 --> 01:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:36.488 --> 02:38.389
OHH.

02:38.457 --> 02:40.792
I'VE NEVER
WANTED YOU MORE.

02:40.860 --> 02:42.561
DO YOU EVER THINK
AT TIMES LIKE THIS

02:42.628 --> 02:44.663
WHEN I'M NOT
LOOKING MY BEST,

02:44.730 --> 02:47.832
IS WHEN I NEED TO FEEL
ATTRACTIVE THE MOST?

02:47.983 --> 02:49.784
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S DO IT.

02:49.852 --> 02:51.736
COME ON, STOP IT.

02:51.804 --> 02:53.721
I NEED YOU TO DO
SOMETHING FOR ME, OK?

02:53.789 --> 02:56.274
I ALREADY GOT YOU
YOUR PRECIOUS MEDICINE.

02:56.342 --> 02:58.509
I NEED YOU TO GO
WITH MY FATHER

02:58.577 --> 03:00.595
TO FAMILY NIGHT
AT THE SENIOR CENTER.

03:00.663 --> 03:02.464
IT STARTS AT 6:00.

03:02.531 --> 03:04.165
I CAN'T. TONIGHT
I HAVE PLANS.

03:04.233 --> 03:05.300
WHAT PLANS?

03:05.367 --> 03:08.636
I WAS GONNA DRINK BEER
AND GAMBLE ON-LINE.

03:08.703 --> 03:10.255
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT,

03:10.322 --> 03:11.656
IF YOU'RE GONNA BE
SUCH A BABY ABOUT IT,

03:11.723 --> 03:13.708
THEN I'LL JUST GO MYSELF.

03:20.282 --> 03:22.117
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

03:22.184 --> 03:24.552
GOSH...

03:24.620 --> 03:26.954
HERE, BUNDLE UP.

03:32.695 --> 03:36.130
THIS IS WHERE
GUS LUMSEN DIED.

03:36.198 --> 03:38.617
THIS IS WHERE
CHUCK RANDOLPH DIED.

03:38.684 --> 03:42.354
AND THIS IS WHERE
THEY GIVE US JUICE.

03:43.922 --> 03:46.541
WOW. WELL, THIS IS GREAT.
THIS IS REALLY, REALLY GREAT.

03:46.608 --> 03:49.276
OH, MY GOD! IS IT-
IS IT 6:05 ALREADY?

03:50.679 --> 03:54.015
OH, NO. HERE COMES THAT
BRAGGART PHILIP WALDECOTT.

03:54.083 --> 03:55.249
SPOONER.

03:55.317 --> 03:56.835
WALDECOTT.

03:56.902 --> 04:00.138
AM I MISSING ANYTHING?
I'M A LITTLE LATE.

04:00.205 --> 04:02.690
I JUST HAD A MEETING
WITH OUR CONTRACTOR.

04:02.758 --> 04:06.544
WE'RE BUILDING A NEW
GUEST WING ONTO OUR HOUSE.

04:06.611 --> 04:07.745
WHAT A COINCIDENCE.

04:07.813 --> 04:10.281
<i>WE'RE BUILDING A NEW
GUEST WING ON OUR HOUSE.</i>

04:10.349 --> 04:13.385
WELL, LUCKY FOR US,

04:31.954 --> 04:33.721
NICE TO MEET YOU,

04:33.789 --> 04:36.574
ACTUALLY, EVERYBODY
CALLS ME DOUG FOR SHORT.

04:37.910 --> 04:41.545
SO, THE MEMBER-GUEST
SHUFFLEBOARD TOURNAMENT

05:07.989 --> 05:09.607
OK, COUPLE OF THINGS.

05:09.675 --> 05:12.210
NOT WARREN, NOT GOIN'.

05:14.580 --> 05:16.314
WELL, COME ON, WARREN.

05:16.382 --> 05:18.699
YOU'VE BEEN BEGGING
TO SEE MY POTTERY.

05:20.402 --> 05:21.602
I'M SORRY, DOUGLAS.

05:21.670 --> 05:22.820
I DIDN'T MEAN TO
PUT YOU ON THE SPOT.

05:22.888 --> 05:26.658
IT JUST WOULD'VE BEEN NICE TO
STICK IT TO THAT SMUG BASTARD.

05:26.725 --> 05:29.460
YOU AND ME TOGETHER, STEPPING
INTO THAT WINNER'S CIRCLE,

05:29.528 --> 05:31.696
HOLDING UP
THAT FOOT POWDER.

05:31.763 --> 05:34.299
I COULD ALMOST TASTE IT.

05:35.967 --> 05:37.068
SPOONER.

05:37.136 --> 05:38.636
CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS?

05:38.704 --> 05:42.207
MY GRAVY BOAT

05:42.274 --> 05:43.792
CONGRATULATIONS.

05:43.859 --> 05:45.377
I'M SORRY TO SEE YOU
WALK AWAY EMPTY-HANDED.

05:45.444 --> 05:47.178
BUT I SUPPOSE
YOU COULD GO HOME

05:47.246 --> 05:49.614
AND LOOK AT YOUR RIBBONS
FROM OTHER YEARS...

05:49.682 --> 05:53.685
OH, NO, WAIT. YOU
HAVEN'T WON ANY, HAVE YOU?

05:53.753 --> 05:55.603
NO.

05:55.671 --> 06:00.558
WELL, ANYWAY, I GUESS
I'LL BE SEEING YOU IN ST.BARTS.

06:06.482 --> 06:09.484
ALL RIGHT, THEY'RE
GOIN' DOWN.

06:10.769 --> 06:13.354
CARRIE, IT'S HOLLY.
CAN I COME IN?

06:13.422 --> 06:15.774
YEAH. HEY, COME IN.
JOIN THE PARTY.

06:15.841 --> 06:17.942
YOUR DAD TOLD ME
YOU WERE SICK,

06:18.010 --> 06:19.076
SO I BROUGHT YOU
SOME SOUP.

06:19.144 --> 06:21.178
OH, THAT IS SO SWEET.

06:21.246 --> 06:22.396
THANK YOU.

06:22.464 --> 06:24.582

06:24.649 --> 06:25.950
IT SMELLS GREAT.

06:26.018 --> 06:28.352
YEAH.

06:28.420 --> 06:29.987
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

06:30.055 --> 06:31.305
OH, IT'S GREAT.

06:31.373 --> 06:33.875
YEAH, IT'S SOMETHING MY MOM USED
TO MAKE IT FOR HER BOYFRIENDS

06:33.942 --> 06:36.210
WHEN THEY WERE DETOXING.

06:36.277 --> 06:38.613
OH, WELL, IT WAS VERY
NICE OF YOU. THANK YOU.

06:38.681 --> 06:40.164
SURE. I CAN COME BY TOMORROW
AND BRING YOU SOME MORE

06:40.232 --> 06:41.599
IF YOU'RE STILL
NOT FEELING WELL.

06:41.666 --> 06:43.484
WELL, IF YOU DON'T MIND.

06:43.552 --> 06:44.418
NOT AT ALL.

06:44.570 --> 06:46.403
ALL RIGHT,
HERE YOU GO.

06:46.471 --> 06:48.305
FEEL BETTER, AND I
WILL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

06:48.373 --> 06:49.306
OK.

06:49.374 --> 06:51.241
YEAH.
OH, AND, HOL...

06:51.309 --> 06:53.878
COULD YOU MAYBE BRING ME
SOMETHING A LITTLE SWEET, TOO?

06:53.945 --> 06:55.246
LIKE WHAT?

06:55.314 --> 06:56.681
I DON'T KNOW.

06:56.749 --> 06:58.215
SURPRISE ME.

07:02.687 --> 07:05.322
OH, DOUGLAS, THANKS
AGAIN FOR DOING THIS.

07:05.390 --> 07:06.758
IT MEANS THE WORLD
TO ME.

07:06.825 --> 07:09.026
YOU GOT IT, ARTHUR.
BY THE WAY,

07:09.094 --> 07:10.962
THEY PUT A DRAWSTRING
ON SWEATPANTS FOR A REASON.

07:11.029 --> 07:13.180
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET
THIS PRACTICE UNDERWAY.

07:13.248 --> 07:14.999
WE'LL LEARN THE COURT,

07:15.066 --> 07:17.001
GET OUR TEAM
STRATEGY TOGETHER,

07:17.068 --> 07:18.769
AND WHILE WE'RE AT IT,

07:18.837 --> 07:20.921
TAKE IN THE SIGHTS.

07:23.208 --> 07:24.959
YOU KNOW, WHAT HAPPENS
AT THE SENIOR CENTER

07:25.027 --> 07:27.028
STAYS AT
THE SENIOR CENTER.

07:27.096 --> 07:28.429
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, LET'S DO IT.

07:28.497 --> 07:30.364
LET'S SEE WHAT
THIS GAME'S ALL ABOUT.

07:30.432 --> 07:34.168
ALL RIGHT. REMEMBER, SHUFFLEBOARD
IS TRICKIER THAN IT LOOKS.

07:34.236 --> 07:36.203
I LETTERED
IN 3 SPORTS, ARTHUR.

07:36.271 --> 07:39.607
I THINK I CAN SLIDE A SALAD
PLATE ACROSS A CEMENT FLOOR.

07:41.710 --> 07:45.496
OOH, LOOKS LIKE I KNOCKED
YOU OUT AGAIN, DOUGLAS.

07:45.564 --> 07:47.981
YOU'RE IN THE ZONE,
JOSEPHINE.

07:48.049 --> 07:48.950
YOUR TURN.

07:54.857 --> 07:58.893
ONCE AGAIN, YOU'VE GONE
A BIT TOO FAR, DEAR.

07:58.960 --> 08:00.929
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT? THE
SHORT ONE'S PISSING ME OFF.

08:00.996 --> 08:03.364
RELAX. SHE'S JUST TRYING
TO GET IN YOUR HEAD.

08:03.432 --> 08:05.266
NOW, LISTEN, DOUGLAS.
YOU'RE STRONG.

08:05.334 --> 08:07.335
YOU NEED TO CONTROL
THAT STRENGTH.

08:07.403 --> 08:09.971
MAKE IT WORK FOR YOU.
LIKE THIS.

08:19.565 --> 08:20.597
NOW YOU.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.684
THANKS FOR THE MATCH,
BOYS.

08:56.752 --> 08:58.619
WE'LL SEE YOU INSIDE.

08:58.687 --> 09:00.454
LOSERS BUY THE JUICE.

09:02.758 --> 09:03.958
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

09:04.026 --> 09:05.626
<i>IT LOOKED MUCH EASIER
ON THE LOVE BOAT.</i>

09:05.694 --> 09:06.810
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT, DOUGLAS.

09:06.878 --> 09:08.495
WITH A LITTLE MORE
PRACTICE, TEAM SPOONER

09:08.563 --> 09:10.764
WILL BE NECK DEEP
IN FOOT POWDER.

09:10.833 --> 09:13.034
WE'LL SHOW THAT
WALDECOTT A THING OR TWO.

09:13.101 --> 09:15.286
THANKS, ARTHUR. YOU'RE RIGHT,
WE'RE GONNA WIN THIS THING.

09:15.353 --> 09:16.788
YOU BET WE WILL.
YEAH.

09:18.857 --> 09:20.324
OH, BOY.

09:32.654 --> 09:34.689
OH, DAMN IT!

09:39.677 --> 09:41.946
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? THAT
ONE WAS HEADING FOR THE 10.

09:42.013 --> 09:44.014
<i>WHAT ARE YOU DOING?</i>

09:44.082 --> 09:46.784
COULDN'T FIND A COURT
THAT'S OPEN AT NIGHT.

09:46.851 --> 09:49.587
HOW ABOUT OUR VERY LONG,
WELL-LIT DRIVEWAY?

09:49.655 --> 09:50.905
THEN I'D HAVE TO
ROLL UP THE HOSE.

09:50.972 --> 09:52.372
IT'S A WHOLE THING.

09:52.440 --> 09:54.691
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A FREE
PASS ON THIS ONE, HONEY,

09:54.760 --> 09:56.861
BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING
A NICE THING FOR MY DAD.

09:56.928 --> 09:58.345

I'M GONNA TAKE OFF.

10:52.067 --> 10:54.035
OH, UM, HOLLY...

10:54.103 --> 10:55.436
WHAT'S WRONG?

10:55.503 --> 10:57.355
NOTHING. IT'S JUST

10:57.422 --> 11:00.007
WHAT I'M GONNA DO

11:00.075 --> 11:02.159
OH, I'VE GOT MORE OF THE

YEEEAHHH. I WAS THINKING

11:19.411 --> 11:21.412
O- OK, YEAH.
NO PROBLEM.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.647
I JUST HAVE TO
STOP BY THE STORE.

11:23.715 --> 11:26.283

11:26.351 --> 11:28.852
OH, AND, COULD YOU MAYBE

11:28.920 --> 11:31.755
I FEEL SO BAD. I HAVEN'T

11:31.823 --> 11:33.991
WH-WHAT WOULD HE LIKE?

11:34.059 --> 11:36.894
UM, I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE SOME PASTA?

11:36.962 --> 11:38.763
CAESAR SALAD?

11:38.830 --> 11:40.530
OH... OK.

11:40.598 --> 11:41.631
UM...

11:41.699 --> 11:44.301
WE HAVE, UM,
LAMB CHOPS

11:44.369 --> 11:49.106
AND PASTA,
CAESAR SALAD.

11:49.174 --> 11:51.075
DOES THAT HAVE
ANCHOVIES IN IT?

11:51.142 --> 11:52.927
USUALLY DOES.
DO YOU WANT 'EM?

11:52.995 --> 11:56.080
PUT 'EM ON THE SIDE.

11:56.148 --> 11:57.364
ANCHOVIES
ON THE SIDE.

11:57.432 --> 11:58.766
AND TO DRINK?

11:58.834 --> 12:00.934
IS SPRITE OK?
7- UP?

12:01.203 --> 12:03.087
OK. OK.

12:03.154 --> 12:04.255
GREAT.

12:04.323 --> 12:05.006
SPRITE.

12:05.073 --> 12:06.090
AH-CHOO!

12:06.157 --> 12:07.224
THANKS.
GOD BLESS YOU.

12:07.292 --> 12:09.093
SPRITE.

12:14.733 --> 12:15.933
HELLO, SPENCE.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.302
CALLING IT A NIGHT?

12:18.370 --> 12:19.937
YEP. I AM BEAT.

12:20.005 --> 12:22.206
I CANNOT WAIT
TO GET INTO BED.

12:22.274 --> 12:23.574
I'M SURE THAT WILL
GIVE ME GREAT COMFORT

12:23.642 --> 12:27.145
WHILE I'M ALONE ON THE
PLATFORM BEING STABBED.

12:27.212 --> 12:29.947
IT'S PERFECTLY SAFE
DOWN HERE.

12:31.549 --> 12:36.120
ALTHOUGH I THINK PEOPLE COULD
PICK UP AFTER THEMSELVES.

12:42.610 --> 12:44.145
IF I WAS A BETTING MAN,

12:44.212 --> 12:46.213
I'D SAY YOU COULDN'T
DO THAT AGAIN.

12:53.972 --> 12:56.106
I GUESS YOU'D LOSE,
THEN.

12:56.174 --> 12:57.824
HOLD IT, SON.

12:57.892 --> 12:59.826
BY ANY CHANCE,

12:59.894 --> 13:02.146
HAVE YOU EVER PLAYED
SHUFFLEBOARD?

13:02.213 --> 13:04.531
NO.

13:04.599 --> 13:06.316
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT.
YOU MUST HAVE PLAYED BEFORE.

13:06.384 --> 13:08.385
YOU HAVE PERFECT FORM.

13:08.453 --> 13:11.055
LOOK, I HAVE A TOURNAMENT
COMING UP.

13:11.123 --> 13:12.456
I WANT YOU TO
PLAY WITH ME.

13:12.524 --> 13:13.824
NO!

13:13.892 --> 13:15.425
I TOLD YOU
I DON'T PLAY!

13:17.795 --> 13:19.363
ANYMORE.

13:21.233 --> 13:22.783
THE SUMMER
I TURNED 14

13:22.851 --> 13:24.384
WAS A MAGICAL TIME.

13:24.452 --> 13:27.571
I WAS THE BEST JUNIOR
SHUFFLEBOARDER IN THE CITY.

13:27.638 --> 13:30.291
MY COACH SAID,
"SKY'S THE LIMIT."

13:30.358 --> 13:32.242
COLLEGE RECRUITERS
WERE HOUNDING ME.

13:32.310 --> 13:33.777
AND THE GIRLS...

13:33.845 --> 13:36.513
HELLO, FIRST BASE.

13:36.581 --> 13:39.149
I HAD JUST GOTTEN BACK
FROM A GOODWILL TOUR

13:39.217 --> 13:40.417
OF THE IRON CURTAIN
COUNTRIES,

13:40.485 --> 13:43.153
AND I WAS ON TOP
OF THE WORLD.

13:43.221 --> 13:45.389
HEY, MA. I'M GOING TO
THE SHUFFLEBOARD NATIONALS

13:45.457 --> 13:47.057
IN BOCA RATON.

13:47.125 --> 13:48.592
MAYBE I CAN WIN US
SOME PRIZE MONEY

13:48.660 --> 13:49.793
AND FINALLY GET US-

13:52.197 --> 13:53.647
MOM?

13:53.714 --> 13:54.832
COACH WALLACH?

13:54.899 --> 13:56.400
HEY, KID.

13:56.468 --> 13:58.001
HOW YOU DOIN'?

13:58.069 --> 14:00.237
THAT'S GREAT NEWS,
SPENCER.

14:00.305 --> 14:03.741
NOW BE A DEAR,
AND GET MOMMY A GINGER ALE.

14:10.481 --> 14:11.531
THAT'S A TERRIBLE STORY.

14:11.683 --> 14:14.685
ALTHOUGH NOT EXACTLY
A SURPRISE ENDING.

14:17.556 --> 14:18.922
ON THAT DAY,
I PUT DOWN MY CUE

14:18.990 --> 14:22.292
AND I WILL NEVER
PICK IT UP AGAIN.

14:22.360 --> 14:23.878
FINE.

14:23.945 --> 14:26.847
BUT DO ME ONE FAVOR THEN.

14:28.483 --> 14:32.586
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS IS?

14:32.654 --> 14:36.791
OF COURSE I DO. IT'S A
REGULATION SHUFFLEBOARD GLOVE.

14:36.858 --> 14:38.292
PUT IT ON.

14:38.359 --> 14:40.494
AND IF YOU STILL
FEEL THE SAME WAY,

14:40.561 --> 14:42.897
WE'LL NEVER SPEAK
OF THIS AGAIN.

14:52.757 --> 14:56.059
GOD, THIS JUST FEELS
SO RIGHT.

15:16.681 --> 15:17.965
UH...

15:18.032 --> 15:19.166
ARTHUR.

15:19.234 --> 15:20.934
WHAT'S SPENCE DOING HERE?

15:21.002 --> 15:23.704
AND WHY IS HE DRESSED
LIKE MITCH GAYLORD?

15:23.772 --> 15:27.074
OHH, THERE'S NO EASY WAY
TO SAY THIS, DOUGLAS.

15:27.141 --> 15:29.510
I'M MAKING SOME CHANGES
ON TEAM SPOONER.

15:29.578 --> 15:31.912
ACTUALLY,
JUST ONE CHANGE.

15:31.980 --> 15:33.213
HE'S IN, YOU'RE OUT.

15:33.281 --> 15:35.716
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

15:35.784 --> 15:37.217
LET'S NOT
MAKE A SCENE.

15:37.285 --> 15:38.652
WHAT ABOUT
ALL THAT TALK

15:38.720 --> 15:40.020
ABOUT ME AND YOU
AGAINST THE WORLD,

15:40.088 --> 15:42.489
HOLDING UP THAT FOOT POWDER,
WINNING THIS THING TOGETHER?

15:42.557 --> 15:44.341
THE OPERATIVE TERM
THERE WAS "WINNING."

15:44.409 --> 15:46.793
LOOK AT HIM, DOUGLAS.
HE'S BEAUTIFUL.

15:46.945 --> 15:50.347
LIKE HE'S GENETICALLY
BRED TO PLAY THE GAME.

15:50.415 --> 15:51.549
FINE.

15:51.616 --> 15:52.682
YOU PLAY WITH
YOUR BOYFRIEND,

15:52.750 --> 15:54.084
BUT I GOT NEWS FOR YOU,
OLD MAN.

15:54.152 --> 15:56.153
I'VE BEEN PRACTICING
MY GAME,

15:56.221 --> 15:57.787
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
HERE'S A LITTLE TASTE

15:57.855 --> 15:59.356
OF WHAT YOU'RE
GONNA BE MISSING.

16:00.926 --> 16:04.578
OH! MY GOOD HIP!

16:48.924 --> 16:50.324
HEY.

16:50.425 --> 16:53.109
HEY, HOL, A LITTLE LATE
TONIGHT. I'M STARVING.

16:53.177 --> 16:56.029
OK. I HAVE
YOUR SAFFRON RISOTTO

16:56.097 --> 16:58.132
AND YOUR CHILEAN SEA
BASS WITH MANGO CHUTNEY.

16:59.534 --> 17:01.852
WAIT A MINUTE. YOU DIDN'T
MAKE ME YOUR SPRING ROLLS?

17:01.920 --> 17:04.788
OH, NO, NO. I COULDN'T
FIND ANY FRESH CRAB MEAT,

17:04.856 --> 17:07.825
AND I KNOW HOW YOU
HATE THE IMITATION.

17:07.893 --> 17:10.042
OK. YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:10.111 --> 17:11.712
DON'T YOU WORRY ABOUT IT.

17:11.780 --> 17:13.747
OK?

17:13.815 --> 17:17.967
SO, UH... I SEE YOU
WENT TO WORK TODAY.

17:18.035 --> 17:23.757
YEAH, YEAH. NEW JOB, SO I HAD TO
DRAG MYSELF OUT OF BED, YOU KNOW?

17:23.825 --> 17:27.077
I SEE YOU ALSO DRAGGED
YOURSELF TO BLOOMINGDALE'S.

17:28.646 --> 17:30.914
WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING
AT HERE, HOL?

17:30.981 --> 17:32.766
NO. WELL, IT'S JUST
THAT, I MEAN,

17:32.834 --> 17:34.501
IF SOMEONE WERE TO
WALK IN HERE,

17:34.569 --> 17:37.137
THEY MIGHT THINK
THAT I WAS THE SICK ONE

17:37.205 --> 17:39.640
AND THAT YOU WERE THE
WELL ONE. THAT'S ALL.

17:39.708 --> 17:43.460
WELL, I CAN'T SPEAK FOR YOU,
BUT I AM SICK.

17:43.528 --> 17:45.562
WHAT, SHOULD I BE SITTING
HERE WITH A BIG RED NOSE

17:45.630 --> 17:47.998
AND A THERMOMETER
HANGING OUT OF MY MOUTH?

17:48.065 --> 17:48.849
A HOT WATER BOTTLE
RIGHT HERE?

17:48.916 --> 17:51.702
THIS IS WHAT A SICK
PERSON LOOKS LIKE.

17:51.770 --> 17:53.002
NO, NO. IT'S JUST...

17:53.070 --> 17:54.705
WELL, YOU BOUGHT
LINGERIE.

17:54.772 --> 17:56.273
I AM SICK!

17:56.341 --> 17:57.941
ALL RIGHT, I'M SICK!

17:58.009 --> 18:01.212
I GOT A NEW JOB.
IT'S VERY STRESSFUL.

18:01.279 --> 18:03.146
IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT TIME TO BE SICK.

18:03.214 --> 18:05.382
YOU CALLING ME A LIAR? I
DIDN'T MEAN TO CALL YOU A LIAR.

18:05.450 --> 18:08.769
THE ONLY THING THAT WAS MAKING
ME FEEL BETTER WAS YOUR COOKING.

18:08.837 --> 18:10.437
I REALLY WANTED
THE SPRING ROLLS.

18:10.505 --> 18:12.956
I WILL-I WILL MAKE
THOSE SPRING ROLLS.

18:13.024 --> 18:15.058
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHERE
TO GET THE CRAB MEAT.

18:15.126 --> 18:17.761
WELL, YOU CAN GET THEM
DOWN BY THE DOCKS

18:17.829 --> 18:20.097
IF YOU GET THERE
WHEN THE BOATS COME IN.

18:21.216 --> 18:23.517
OK. OK.
I'LL DO THAT.

18:23.585 --> 18:25.118
AGAIN, I'M REALLY-
AH-CHOO!

18:25.186 --> 18:26.420
SORRY.

18:26.487 --> 18:30.223
OOH, YOU DIDN'T BREATHE
ON ANY OF THE FOOD, DID YOU?

18:30.291 --> 18:31.124
NO, I WAS CAREFUL.

18:31.276 --> 18:32.242
OK.

18:32.310 --> 18:33.477
ALL RIGHT, SWEETIE.

18:36.347 --> 18:37.748
HEY, MA!

18:37.816 --> 18:38.965
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BELIEVE IT.

18:39.033 --> 18:40.967
I'M DOIN' IT.
I'M PLAYING AGAIN.

18:41.035 --> 18:42.969
I EVEN GOT IN TOUCH
WITH MY OLD COACH.

18:43.037 --> 18:45.406
HE SAID HE WAS GONNA-

18:46.891 --> 18:47.991
MOM?

18:48.058 --> 18:49.192
COACH WALLACH?

18:49.260 --> 18:51.294
OH, HEY, KID,
HOW YOU DOING?

18:51.362 --> 18:55.165
WELL, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO
GOT BACK IN TOUCH WITH HIM.

18:55.232 --> 18:58.635
BE A DEAR AND GET
MOMMY A GINGER ALE.

19:03.024 --> 19:04.558
BUT THE FINALS
ARE TOMORROW.

19:04.626 --> 19:05.692
YOU GOTTA PLAY.

19:05.760 --> 19:08.061
COME ON,
STOP BLUBBERING.

19:09.297 --> 19:12.098
SO YOUR MOTHER GETS
AROUND. WHAT ELSE IS NEW?

19:13.200 --> 19:15.302
OH, THE HELL WITH YOU!

19:21.742 --> 19:23.894
WHAT, ARE YOU MAKING
A SANDWICH?

19:25.296 --> 19:29.633
WHAT GAVE ME AWAY, THE
BREAD, HAM, AND MUSTARD?

19:29.701 --> 19:31.969
BIG MAN SCORES AGAIN.

19:32.036 --> 19:33.570
ANYWAY, EAT UP.

19:33.638 --> 19:35.739
YOU NEED YOUR STRENGTH.
TOMORROW'S A BIG DAY.

19:35.807 --> 19:37.491
YEAH? WHAT'S SO
BIG ABOUT IT?

19:37.559 --> 19:39.176
WHY, YOU AND I
ARE IN THE FINALS

19:39.244 --> 19:40.677
AGAINST PHILIP
AND WARREN.

19:40.745 --> 19:42.746
DON'T TELL ME
YOU FORGOT?

19:42.813 --> 19:45.282
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT? YOU DUMPED ME.

19:45.349 --> 19:48.035
DUMPED YOU? THAT
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE ME.

19:49.570 --> 19:52.205
WAIT A SECOND. THAT
WAS SPENCE ON THE PHONE.

19:52.273 --> 19:55.041
HE'S OUT, AND YOU WANT
ME BACK IN, IS THAT IT?

19:55.109 --> 19:58.945
GREAT. NOW THAT WE'RE UP TO
SPEED, LET'S TALK STRATEGY.

19:59.013 --> 20:00.764
WHAT-WHAT WOULD
POSSIBLY MAKE YOU THINK

20:00.832 --> 20:02.900
I WOULD COME BACK AND
HELP YOU WIN THIS THING?

20:02.967 --> 20:05.251
WHY WOULD I HELP YOU
DO ANYTHING?

20:09.757 --> 20:12.058
YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:12.126 --> 20:13.527
I'M SORRY, DOUGLAS.

20:13.595 --> 20:16.897
I GUESS WHEN YOU'VE FAILED IN
AS MANY THINGS AS I HAVE IN LIFE,

20:16.965 --> 20:20.433
A BASKET OF FOOT POWDER
LOOKS LIKE THE NOBEL PRIZE.

20:22.637 --> 20:24.237
I'VE LOST THAT.

20:24.305 --> 20:27.107
AND NOW I'VE PROBABLY
LOST YOU, TOO.

20:28.175 --> 20:29.810
WELL, GOOD NIGHT.

20:32.346 --> 20:34.180
ALL RIGHT, I'LL PLAY.

20:35.282 --> 20:36.383
REALLY?

20:36.450 --> 20:39.219
YEAH, BUT YOU REALIZE

20:39.286 --> 20:41.187
WE'RE PROBABLY NOT
GONNA WIN THIS THING.

20:41.255 --> 20:45.526
JUST YOU DOING THIS
MEANS I'VE ALREADY WON.

20:49.113 --> 20:50.964
LOSER! I WOULD'VE BEEN
BETTER OFF WITH AN APE.

20:51.032 --> 20:52.733
YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T
CARE ABOUT WINNING.

20:52.800 --> 20:54.234
YOU'RE DEAD TO ME.

20:54.301 --> 20:56.236
SAME HERE!

20:56.304 --> 20:59.039
AHA, SWEET RELIEF.

20:59.106 --> 21:00.474
HEH HEH HEH.

21:11.585 --> 21:12.785
CARRIE!

21:12.853 --> 21:14.938
I HAVE YOUR JAMBALAYA.

21:15.006 --> 21:19.476
COME ON. AND 2, AND 3,
AND 4! COME ON!

21:19.543 --> 21:20.910
LIFT YOUR LEGS!

21:20.979 --> 21:23.580
JUST LEAVE IT ON THE
COUNTER THERE. THANKS, HOL.

21:23.647 --> 21:25.248
KEEP THOSE ELBOWS UP.

21:25.316 --> 21:29.252
COME ON, AND 1!
AND 2! AND 3! AND 4!

21:29.320 --> 21:30.570
FEEL THE BURN.

21:30.638 --> 21:34.341
AH-CHOO!
