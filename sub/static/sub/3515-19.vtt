you wouldn't mind

would you?

I will book you for murder.

36:52.880 --> 36:53.961
(UNLOCKS DOOR)

36:58.040 --> 36:59.405
Here.

37:02.920 --> 37:04.331
Turn around.

37:06.840 --> 37:08.171
All right.

37:22.480 --> 37:23.720
NICK: Get out.

37:28.080 --> 37:30.208
There's something I want
to show you in there.

37:30.280 --> 37:33.204
Yeah, sure there is. I'm not
going in there with you.

37:33.280 --> 37:36.090
I don't blame her. I wouldn't
go in there with us either.

37:36.160 --> 37:37.525
You don't have to go anywhere.

37:41.520 --> 37:42.521
(KEYS JANGLING)

37:47.280 --> 37:48.691
What kind of cops
are you, anyway?

37:48.760 --> 37:50.330
Good question.

37:50.560 --> 37:52.164
I wish I had a good answer.

37:53.480 --> 37:55.130
Take her cuffs off.
You sure?

37:55.200 --> 37:56.247
Yeah.

37:57.840 --> 38:00.525
She needs to see
this for herself.

38:02.320 --> 38:03.526
See what?

38:03.600 --> 38:05.011
Look in it.

38:33.520 --> 38:34.521
What is this?

38:35.240 --> 38:37.083
The truth

38:37.720 --> 38:39.404
that no one's ever
told you before.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.845
There's a lot more
of it in there.

38:43.920 --> 38:45.524
You need to go in there to...

39:05.720 --> 39:07.563
What do you mean,
"This is the truth?"

39:07.640 --> 39:09.005
HANK: I'll get us
some coffee.

39:09.080 --> 39:11.321
This is gonna take a while.

39:15.320 --> 39:16.321
(DOOR CLOSES)

39:17.600 --> 39:18.647
It's my truth, too.

39:19.600 --> 39:20.601
I see what you do.

39:20.680 --> 39:21.727
No, you can't.

39:22.320 --> 39:25.130
Everything in these books,

39:26.480 --> 39:27.561
I can see, too.

39:30.280 --> 39:31.327
I don't understand.

39:33.080 --> 39:34.650
Neither did I.

39:34.840 --> 39:37.889
I thought I was going
crazy, but I had somebody

39:38.840 --> 39:42.242
who could explain to
me what a Grimm was.

39:42.320 --> 39:44.129
Now, you said that
they called you that.

39:44.200 --> 39:46.320
Yeah, some of them did. I
didn't know what that meant.

39:46.760 --> 39:48.649
That's why I brought you here.

39:50.800 --> 39:53.246
I want to explain to
you what it does mean.

39:59.760 --> 40:01.046
Tell me.

40:02.800 --> 40:03.801
(CLICKS)

40:09.640 --> 40:10.721
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

40:10.800 --> 40:11.847
Yeah.

40:13.080 --> 40:14.491
Miss Schade is here to see you.

40:18.520 --> 40:19.601
Send her in.

40:19.680 --> 40:20.966
Yeah.

40:32.200 --> 40:34.646
I don't know if I'll
ever forgive you.

40:36.360 --> 40:38.283
I don't know if I'll
ever forgive myself.

40:38.360 --> 40:41.091
I know you think you
did the right thing.

40:41.360 --> 40:43.567
I don't know, maybe you did.

40:43.640 --> 40:45.369
The Royals never
would've stopped.

40:46.400 --> 40:48.641
Probably would've killed me.

40:51.800 --> 40:54.770
I don't think I'll ever
understand it completely,

40:56.200 --> 40:59.807
but at least I know
our baby's still alive.

41:36.400 --> 41:37.526
(DOOR OPENS)

41:38.640 --> 41:40.404
Nick?
NICK: Yeah.

41:40.840 --> 41:42.046
Hey, I'm glad you're here.

41:42.120 --> 41:43.200
I picked up Chinese for us.

41:43.240 --> 41:45.527
NICK: Well, I hope
you picked up a lot.

41:49.520 --> 41:51.522
Juliette,

41:51.600 --> 41:54.001
this is Theresa Rubel.

41:58.360 --> 42:00.203
Hi. So...

42:00.280 --> 42:01.560
So Theresa's staying for dinner?

42:01.880 --> 42:04.008
Nobody calls me Theresa.

42:06.760 --> 42:07.761
Uh-huh.

42:07.840 --> 42:09.444
So, what do they call you?

42:10.440 --> 42:11.965
They call me Trubel.
