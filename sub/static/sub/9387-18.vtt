Hey, Quagmire,
how was your date last night?

00:37.246 --> 00:38.497
Cleveland,
it was amazing.

00:38.580 --> 00:40.332
You know what I discovered
last night?

00:40.415 --> 00:41.750
Women have
a fourth hole.

00:41.834 --> 00:42.960
What?
Yeah.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.378
I mean,
it's only visible

00:44.461 --> 00:45.921
if you're looking
from exactly the right angle,

00:46.004 --> 00:47.631
like the entrance
to Hogwarts.

00:47.714 --> 00:49.675
But you got to believe
that it's there.

00:49.758 --> 00:51.677
Man, I envy
you single guys.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.804
No families, partying
whenever you want.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.557
These are the only people
I get to party with.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.600
Oh, that's where
the fourth hole is, right there.

00:58.684 --> 01:00.227
Right there in the back
of the knee.

01:00.310 --> 01:01.812
I like having a family.

01:01.895 --> 01:05.190
I got all the crazy out of
my system when I was 18.

01:05.274 --> 01:07.651
Not me. I was dating Lois
the whole time.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.444
I never got to be wild.

01:09.528 --> 01:12.406
Except for that time I rode
the mechanical bull at that bar.

01:12.489 --> 01:14.157
(giggling)

01:14.241 --> 01:16.368
Oh my God,
how embarrassing!

01:16.451 --> 01:19.329
Look how much fun I am!

01:19.413 --> 01:21.832
It's like I missed out
on half my life.

01:21.915 --> 01:24.626
What I wouldn't give
to be 18 again,

01:24.710 --> 01:26.211
like those kids
on spring break.

01:26.295 --> 01:28.130
Grim news from Daytona, Florida,

01:28.213 --> 01:30.340
where the remains
of three female college students

01:30.424 --> 01:32.467
were found
near a local nightclub.

01:32.551 --> 01:34.845
Reports suggest that
all three were violated sexually

01:34.928 --> 01:36.722
before being brutally murdered.

01:36.805 --> 01:37.973
Oh, man, see that?

01:38.056 --> 01:40.184
Everybody's getting laid but me.

01:40.267 --> 01:41.727
(static)

01:41.810 --> 01:43.604
Oh, come on! Oh!

01:43.687 --> 01:46.231
Hang on, I'll fix it.

01:46.315 --> 01:47.566
Oh!

01:47.649 --> 01:48.984
Oh, my God,
is he dead?

01:49.067 --> 01:50.694
I think he might
be dead!

01:50.777 --> 01:52.154
Oh, did you
hear that?

01:52.237 --> 01:54.031
Noah Wylie here thinks
he might be dead.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.074
Step aside, Junior.

01:56.158 --> 01:58.160
Nope, he's just
knocked out.

01:58.243 --> 02:00.078
Damn, I drove
all the way out here.

02:00.162 --> 02:02.080
I had to cancel
another appointment.

02:02.164 --> 02:04.917
I never like to be
too far away from Mike Wallace.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.002
(typewriter keys clicking)

02:12.716 --> 02:15.427
Hey, Death, I-I got
a favor to ask you.

02:15.511 --> 02:18.931
Could you let me go back in time
and be 18 again?

02:19.014 --> 02:20.933
What, are you high? No.

02:21.016 --> 02:24.144
Coming up next on ESPN,
Women's Professional...

02:24.228 --> 02:25.979
All right, you win.
Let's go.

02:26.063 --> 02:27.898
But just
for one night.

02:38.408 --> 02:40.202
What the hell?
Where are we?

02:40.285 --> 02:43.413
Oh my God, this is...
this is Newport Country Club!

02:43.497 --> 02:45.332
I used to be
a towel boy here!

02:45.415 --> 02:46.542
That's right, Peter.

02:46.625 --> 02:47.876
You're 18 years old
again.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.795
At least that's
how everyone'll see you.

02:51.839 --> 02:54.424
Hey, Peter,
slap me five.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.260
Slap me ten.

02:56.343 --> 02:57.845
Around the side.

02:57.928 --> 02:59.221
And back again.

02:59.304 --> 03:00.472
Up high.

03:00.556 --> 03:01.849
Down low.

03:01.932 --> 03:04.184
Now over by the
diving board.

03:05.686 --> 03:08.272
Now on the other
side of the pool.

03:11.358 --> 03:13.861
All right, now I want you
to meet me at this address

03:13.944 --> 03:16.238
in an hour, and we'll
slap five there.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.031
Then afterwards,
we'll hit the bars.

03:18.115 --> 03:19.408
That sounds good to me.

03:19.491 --> 03:21.743
I'm 18, and I'm ready
to do some living.

03:21.827 --> 03:24.413
We are gonna raise more hell
than Hellraiser.

03:24.496 --> 03:26.415
(muffled laughter)

03:26.498 --> 03:29.251
Hey, honey, you want some salt
for your steak?

03:29.334 --> 03:31.753
Yeah, sure.

03:31.837 --> 03:33.172
Aha, gotcha!

03:33.255 --> 03:35.340
That's more salt
than you wanted.

03:35.424 --> 03:37.676
LOIS:
Hello, boys.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.720
(Kenny Loggins'
"Mr. Night" plays)

03:43.348 --> 03:47.352
Wow. 18-year-old Lois.

03:47.436 --> 03:49.730
Son of a bitch.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.757
I'm really looking
forward to the movie tonight.

04:16.840 --> 04:18.884
Peter and I
are going to see Zapped.

04:18.967 --> 04:20.677
I figured Scott Baio
was androgynous enough

04:20.761 --> 04:22.471
that we could both
fantasize about him,

04:22.554 --> 04:24.181
and no one
would be gay.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.891
Lois, we got the rest
of our lives

04:25.974 --> 04:27.809
for me to not hear
a word you just said,

04:27.893 --> 04:30.687
but tonight, I got plans
with Cleveland.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.524
But we had a date.

Ronald Reagan's weekly radio address.

04:44.159 --> 04:45.661
Ronald Reagan?!

04:45.744 --> 04:46.954
The actor?!

04:47.037 --> 04:48.121
He's president?!

04:48.205 --> 04:49.331
Peter, you're the one
from the future.

04:49.414 --> 04:51.083
You should know...
Ah, forget it.

04:51.166 --> 04:54.670
Oh, you've got to hear
this new Eddie Murphy cassette I bought.

04:54.753 --> 04:56.255
Hey, did you ever
have a barbecue?

04:56.338 --> 04:57.506
(laughing)

04:57.589 --> 04:58.966
I have!

05:02.344 --> 05:04.054
(video game whirring)

05:04.137 --> 05:06.098
Wow. You're really good
at this game.

05:06.181 --> 05:07.891
Yeah, I've logged a lot
of game hours

05:07.975 --> 05:09.351
on Menstrual Ms. Pacman.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.355
What?! What?!

05:13.438 --> 05:14.523
Geez.
Nothing.

05:14.606 --> 05:15.607
Bitch.

05:15.691 --> 05:18.485
So, uh, have you
seen Ghostbusters?

05:18.569 --> 05:19.695
Save your breath,
geekwad.

05:19.778 --> 05:21.113
I'm here
with my boyfriend.

05:21.196 --> 05:22.865
You mean that
quintessentially '80s guy

05:22.948 --> 05:24.783
with his collar
turned up all the way?

05:24.867 --> 05:27.202
Are you hitting
on my girlfriend?

05:27.286 --> 05:28.287
(moaning)

05:28.370 --> 05:29.872
Mmm. That
was nice.

05:29.955 --> 05:30.956
I'll say.

05:31.039 --> 05:32.124
Peter, is that...?

05:32.207 --> 05:34.293
Are you...
Molly Ringwald?

05:34.376 --> 05:35.752
Yeah. How's
it going?

05:35.836 --> 05:37.546
Wow, you're the biggest star
in the world right now.

05:37.629 --> 05:38.630
What are you
doing here?

05:38.714 --> 05:40.799
Oh, I like to hook up
with random bar guys.

05:40.883 --> 05:43.010
Lucky for me, huh?

05:43.093 --> 05:44.928
No, a hobby's good.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.471
All right, Peter,
your time's up.

05:46.555 --> 05:48.015
Aw, man, already?

05:48.098 --> 05:50.225
Yup, come on.
(groans)

05:50.851 --> 05:51.894
Good to meet you, Molly.

05:51.977 --> 05:54.062
I'll be back later
for your career.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.569
Well, I hope you got
your fill, Peter.

06:00.652 --> 06:02.070
Death, that was
totally worth it.

06:02.154 --> 06:04.072
It was even better
than the time

06:04.156 --> 06:05.991
I stumbled into that fat,
lonely women's club.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.453
Uh, excuse me,
could I get directions

06:09.536 --> 06:10.704
to the Providence Civic Center?

06:10.787 --> 06:13.081
ALL:
Ooh!

06:13.916 --> 06:15.083
Do you
like cake?

06:15.167 --> 06:16.293
Yes.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.836
Do you like
my ass?

06:17.920 --> 06:18.921
Yes.

06:19.004 --> 06:21.298
Do you want to eat
cake off my ass?

06:21.381 --> 06:22.758
What kind of cake?

06:22.841 --> 06:25.219
Angel food cake.

06:25.302 --> 06:27.054
Well, Rusty, looks like

06:27.137 --> 06:29.181
we're gonna eat our way
out of another jam.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.157
(yawns)

06:47.241 --> 06:48.450
Honey, you awake?

06:48.534 --> 06:50.244
Morning, sweetie.
Aah!

06:50.327 --> 06:52.412
Who the hell are you?!
What are you doing in my bed?!

06:52.496 --> 06:54.122
Peter, it's me. Molly?

06:54.206 --> 06:55.207
Your wife?

06:55.290 --> 06:56.834
Molly Ringwald?

06:56.917 --> 06:57.918
You're my wife?!

06:58.001 --> 06:59.461
We've been married for 20 years.

06:59.545 --> 07:00.838
What's wrong with you?

07:00.921 --> 07:02.714
Hi. I'm Judd Nelson.

07:02.798 --> 07:04.800
I crash here once
or twice a week.

07:04.883 --> 07:06.593
(overwhelmed sigh)

07:08.428 --> 07:11.306
(screaming)

07:11.390 --> 07:13.433
Brian, Molly Ringwald
is in my bed,

07:13.517 --> 07:14.935
and she says
she's my wife!

07:15.018 --> 07:16.019
That's not all.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.104
Look at this place.

07:17.187 --> 07:18.188
Everything's different.

07:18.272 --> 07:19.857
This is crazy.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.192
Brian, did you ever see
that Twilight Zone episode?

07:22.276 --> 07:24.069
You know, where the
woman wakes up in the hospital,

07:24.152 --> 07:25.529
and all the
doctors are pigs?

07:25.612 --> 07:27.072
Yeah.
I like that one.

07:27.155 --> 07:28.949
But what the hell
is going on here?

07:29.032 --> 07:30.951
You know, I think
I have a theory.

07:31.034 --> 07:33.287
It's possible that
when we went back in time,

07:33.370 --> 07:35.122
we somehow altered the past.

07:35.205 --> 07:36.623
Geez, Brian,
that's more ridiculous

07:36.707 --> 07:40.210
than the theory of why Tom
Cruise runs in all his movies.

07:42.296 --> 07:46.091
Wow, that cameraman
has nice strong arms.

07:46.175 --> 07:48.343
You can't catch me,
gay thoughts.

07:50.679 --> 07:52.556
Hey, where the hell is Lois?
That's weird.

07:52.639 --> 07:55.017
Looks like she's coming out
of Quagmire's house.

07:56.685 --> 07:58.103
Lois, what the hell?

07:58.187 --> 08:00.731
I'm gone for one night,
and you sleep with Quagmire?!

08:00.814 --> 08:02.524
Mr. Griffin,
what I do

08:02.608 --> 08:04.693
with my husband is
none of your business.

08:04.776 --> 08:06.403
Husband?
Morning, Pete.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.031
Hope you and Molly
can still join us for dinner tonight.

08:09.114 --> 08:11.033
Come here, baby.
Let's go play Schoolgirl

08:11.116 --> 08:13.827
And Guy Who Has Sex
With Schoolgirl.

08:13.911 --> 08:15.037
(Lois laughing)

08:15.120 --> 08:16.872
Brian, what the
hell is going on?!

08:16.955 --> 08:18.957
We were only in
1984 one night,

08:19.041 --> 08:21.168
and now everything's
all messed up.

08:21.251 --> 08:24.046
I think I can explain it
to you, Peter.

08:24.129 --> 08:26.882
This line represents
the normal flow of events.

08:26.965 --> 08:29.051
Here's where you met Lois,
here's where you got married,

08:29.134 --> 08:30.427
and here's the present.

08:30.511 --> 08:32.262
And here's the night at the bar.

08:32.346 --> 08:34.181
Now, at some point
during that evening,

08:34.264 --> 08:36.767
you did something that changed
the course of your history,

08:36.850 --> 08:38.685
causing the time line
to skew off

08:38.769 --> 08:40.646
into an alternate tangent,

08:40.729 --> 08:42.314
where you're married
to Molly Ringwald,

08:42.397 --> 08:44.775
Quagmire's married to Lois,
and for some reason,

08:44.858 --> 08:46.276
we have a chalkboard
in the living room.

08:46.360 --> 08:47.736
Well, what are we gonna do?

08:47.819 --> 08:51.281
We got to figure out what
happened at this point in time.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.283
And I'll tell you another thing
that worries me.

08:53.367 --> 08:55.327
You ever hear the theory
that if you kill a butterfly

08:55.410 --> 08:57.955
in the past, it can drastically
alter the present?

08:58.038 --> 09:00.624
Well, who knows
what else we changed.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.417
MAN (on TV):
Tonight on The Tonight Show,

09:02.501 --> 09:04.086
movie star George Clooney.

09:04.169 --> 09:05.254
Oh, he's good.

09:05.337 --> 09:07.506
Comedian Dave Chappelle.

09:07.589 --> 09:08.924
He's funny. Like him.

09:09.007 --> 09:11.510
And musician Harry Connick Jr.

09:11.593 --> 09:12.970
Wow. What a show.

09:13.053 --> 09:16.348
And, now, ladies
and gentleman, here's...

09:16.431 --> 09:17.516
Chevy!

09:17.599 --> 09:19.268
Oh, God, Brian,
we messed up bad.

09:19.351 --> 09:20.811

Don't freak out like you did
when your goldfish died.

09:40.163 --> 09:43.125
Here you go,
Lieutenant Shiny-Sides.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.794

to eat it now.

10:13.071 --> 10:14.573
about President
Gore hunting down

10:14.656 --> 10:16.950
and killing Osama Bin
Laden with his bare hands?

10:17.034 --> 10:18.911
I know. Who would've thought

10:18.994 --> 10:21.830
Bin Laden was hiding out
in the cast of Mad TV.

10:21.914 --> 10:23.332
Man, the perfect
hiding spot.

10:23.415 --> 10:25.167

one would look.

a huge mistake.

10:33.217 --> 10:34.885
What are you talking
about, Peter?

10:34.968 --> 10:36.720
You're supposed
to be married to me.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.263
We're the ones who were
meant to be together.

10:38.347 --> 10:39.723
Not you and
Quagmire.

10:39.806 --> 10:43.060
(laughs) It's a little late for that,
don't you think, Peter?

10:43.143 --> 10:45.187
I mean, there was a time
back when we dated

10:45.270 --> 10:47.814
that I thought
you might be the one,

10:47.898 --> 10:50.025
but as I recall,
you were more interested

10:50.108 --> 10:51.944
in partying
with your friends.

10:52.027 --> 10:55.656
Then Glenn came along,
and stole my heart. (laughs)

10:55.739 --> 10:58.617
When he kissed me that night
at the Country Club Dance,

10:58.700 --> 11:00.953
I knew we'd be together forever.

11:01.036 --> 11:02.788

dessert, too! Oh!

and your dirty puns.

11:09.086 --> 11:10.879

I married you.

11:10.963 --> 11:13.757

Death to send us back to 1984 again

Scalia in a hunting accident,
