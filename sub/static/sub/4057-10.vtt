WEBVTT

00:01.101 --> 00:02.476
Previously on Teen Wolf...

00:02.501 --> 00:03.917
Even if you don't trust me,

00:03.952 --> 00:05.228
I'm still going to be
looking out for you...

00:05.252 --> 00:06.520
Scott. Promise me

00:06.554 --> 00:08.755
you'll do everything you can to save her.

00:08.790 --> 00:09.857
I promise.

00:09.891 --> 00:10.891
They're here.

00:14.928 --> 00:17.139
She's getting worse. If she's a
real werewolf, we can save her.

00:17.163 --> 00:18.498
You gotta give her the bite.

00:18.532 --> 00:19.532
No.

00:22.729 --> 00:25.497
What do you mean, "No"?

00:25.524 --> 00:27.124
Liam, look at her.

00:27.158 --> 00:29.759
She's too weak. It will kill her.

00:29.794 --> 00:31.505
We don't even know what
the mercury's doing to her.

00:31.529 --> 00:33.496
We don't even know if
it is actually mercury.

00:33.531 --> 00:35.041
This can't be the only
way to save her life.

00:35.065 --> 00:36.533
It saved mine.

00:36.567 --> 00:38.435
You know, that was different.

00:38.469 --> 00:40.169
You were hanging off a ledge.

00:40.203 --> 00:42.271
You promised.

00:42.306 --> 00:43.850
You said you'd do everything you could.

00:43.874 --> 00:46.714
Which is why I'm not going to do
something I think is going to kill her.

00:48.545 --> 00:49.778
There has to be...

00:53.082 --> 00:55.050
There has to...

00:55.084 --> 00:56.752
Scott.

01:05.494 --> 01:07.027
There's another way to save her.

01:07.062 --> 01:09.263
Guys, I
don't know what the statistics are

01:09.297 --> 01:10.341
for surviving a werewolf bite,

01:10.365 --> 01:12.433
but she's definitely not surviving this.

01:12.468 --> 01:14.034
We need to do something.

01:27.214 --> 01:29.683
No.

02:45.788 --> 02:47.756
Unit 7, can you 10-9?
I didn't quite get that.

02:47.790 --> 02:49.157
10-4, Dispatch,

02:49.191 --> 02:51.560
I'm southbound on Fryman
following suspicious individual

02:51.594 --> 02:53.161
loping in the middle of the road.

02:53.195 --> 02:54.362
7, clarify loping.

02:54.396 --> 02:55.864
Uh... Running on all fours.

02:55.898 --> 02:57.766
Suspect is possibly a large animal.

02:57.800 --> 02:59.133
Unit 5 to Dispatch,

02:59.168 --> 03:00.634
I'm turning the corner on Lincoln.

03:00.669 --> 03:02.536
Suspect no longer loping but running.

03:02.571 --> 03:04.038
10-4. Unit 5, clarify running.

03:04.072 --> 03:05.873
Two legs. Moving fast.

03:05.907 --> 03:07.041
Copy, what's your speed?

03:07.075 --> 03:08.075
45 to 50.

03:08.109 --> 03:10.477
Advise that suspect is
too large to be human.

03:10.511 --> 03:12.713
10-4, Unit 5, back off and maintain eyes.

03:12.747 --> 03:13.914
Dispatch to all units,

03:13.949 --> 03:17.017
be on the lookout for
suspicious bipedal animal.

03:17.052 --> 03:18.918
Unit 8 to Dispatch,
advise coming up on Taft,

03:18.953 --> 03:20.920
animal is back on all fours and...

03:20.955 --> 03:22.055
Holy...

03:24.524 --> 03:26.960
Unit 8, it's Stilinski. Report.

03:26.994 --> 03:29.896
10-4, Sheriff.
Suspect just leapt over my car.

03:29.930 --> 03:31.530
Dispatch, I have
eyes on the suspect.

03:31.565 --> 03:33.099
Corner of Union, heading north

03:33.133 --> 03:34.533
towards Beacon Hills High School.

03:34.568 --> 03:36.101
Confirm back on all fours.

03:36.135 --> 03:37.970
Uh, 10-4, can you give its 20?

03:38.004 --> 03:39.237
In my rear view mirror.

03:39.271 --> 03:41.372
Coming right toward
me. Advise suspect is...

03:41.407 --> 03:42.240
Oh, my God.

03:42.274 --> 03:43.675
Clark, back off...

03:48.147 --> 03:50.148
All available units
to Beacon Hills High School.

03:50.182 --> 03:51.416
Proceed with caution.

03:53.085 --> 03:54.184
Clark!

03:54.219 --> 03:55.285
I'm here!

03:56.989 --> 03:59.156
Sheriff, my car... It's wrecked.

03:59.190 --> 04:01.125
I'm sorry, it's probably totaled.

04:01.159 --> 04:02.236
I ran half a mile to get here,

04:02.260 --> 04:04.228
trying to follow the... The thing.

04:04.262 --> 04:06.296
Hey, hey, hey... Forget about the car.

04:06.331 --> 04:07.331
Insurance will cover it.

04:07.365 --> 04:08.832
Yeah, well...

04:08.866 --> 04:10.967
I wonder how much insurance the school has.

04:44.667 --> 04:46.400
Success?

04:47.369 --> 04:48.903
Imminent.

05:28.341 --> 05:29.508
Okay.

05:31.178 --> 05:32.544
What's that?

05:32.579 --> 05:34.245
It's called chelation therapy.

05:34.279 --> 05:36.214
It removes heavy metals from the blood.

05:36.248 --> 05:38.717
But, the problem is, is
that can injure the kidneys

05:38.751 --> 05:40.585
and Hayden only has
one to begin with, so...

05:43.522 --> 05:44.889
Hey, you're hurting her.

05:45.457 --> 05:46.457
And you're hurting me.

05:50.762 --> 05:52.996
- Sorry.
- Hey, guys...

05:53.031 --> 05:55.599
Remember, we're here to save a life.

05:55.633 --> 05:57.300
Not kill each other.

05:57.335 --> 05:59.002
It's the full moon.

05:59.037 --> 06:01.471
We can feel it even during the day.

06:01.505 --> 06:03.240
And it's a Supermoon.

06:03.274 --> 06:06.443
What is that supposed to make
you guys, like super strong?

06:06.477 --> 06:07.877
Super aggressive?

06:07.911 --> 06:08.978
Both.

06:47.048 --> 06:49.449
You know we're going to need help with him.

06:51.586 --> 06:52.887
He'll be all right.

06:54.022 --> 06:55.790
He's 16 and in love.

06:57.092 --> 06:59.025
First love. You remember what that's like?

07:00.494 --> 07:02.528
Yeah, trust me, I remember.

07:02.562 --> 07:04.463
All those emotions
mixed with the Supermoon.

07:04.498 --> 07:05.738
Tonight isn't going to be good.

07:06.333 --> 07:07.500
I know.

07:09.503 --> 07:10.603
We need help,

07:11.672 --> 07:14.340
and I don't mean restraints or chains.

07:14.374 --> 07:17.075
I mean Malia, Stiles, Lydia.

07:17.710 --> 07:18.944
You need your pack, Scott.

07:20.013 --> 07:22.080
I'm not so sure I have one anymore.

07:24.317 --> 07:25.517
Let me talk to them.

07:28.021 --> 07:29.788
Let me see what I can do. Okay?

07:36.929 --> 07:37.929
Theo.

07:39.397 --> 07:40.531
Thank you.

07:51.242 --> 07:53.276
Go home, Lydia.

07:53.311 --> 07:55.478
Stilinski isn't telling
anyone where he put the bodies,

07:55.512 --> 07:57.180
and I'm pretty sure I'm not psychic.

07:59.250 --> 08:01.084
But you're drawn to death.

08:03.187 --> 08:04.620
Just like me.

08:06.957 --> 08:08.891
Does that make me a kind of Banshee?

08:11.094 --> 08:12.627
You find bodies.

08:13.396 --> 08:14.897
I find Chimeras.

08:16.566 --> 08:18.133
Dead Chimeras.

08:20.036 --> 08:22.004
So, we're both harbingers of death.

08:23.173 --> 08:25.439
I should probably add that to my resume.

08:28.344 --> 08:30.644
It's on my college applications.

09:28.263 --> 09:30.564
Can they fix it?

09:30.598 --> 09:33.467
There's not enough duct tape
in the world to fix that thing.

09:35.470 --> 09:37.938
Maybe you should try
something other than duct tape.

09:37.973 --> 09:40.074
It's got a bad alternator,

09:40.108 --> 09:41.908
you know, needs all new belts,

09:41.942 --> 09:43.977
transmission's going...

09:44.011 --> 09:46.379
The brake pads are
basically metal on metal.

09:48.215 --> 09:51.117
How come you let it get so bad?

09:51.152 --> 09:53.953
There's been a few distractions,
if you haven't noticed.

09:54.689 --> 09:56.056
I notice.

09:57.224 --> 09:58.891
More than you think I do.

10:00.660 --> 10:02.061
Uh, I didn't mean it like that.

10:02.095 --> 10:03.495
Am I taking you home?

10:05.631 --> 10:07.166
No. Sheriff station.

10:09.035 --> 10:10.569
I gotta talk to my dad.

10:12.338 --> 10:13.505
Does it help knowing?

10:14.640 --> 10:16.708
Knowing what you are?

10:16.742 --> 10:18.409
It doesn't scare me as much.

10:19.778 --> 10:20.845
That I know.

10:22.915 --> 10:24.248
Do I scare you?

10:24.817 --> 10:25.983
Once.

10:26.484 --> 10:27.484
Really?

10:33.991 --> 10:35.625
It was the night I found that werewolf,

10:35.659 --> 10:36.993
the one with the talons.

10:38.996 --> 10:40.997
I thought I was going to die that night.

10:41.398 --> 10:42.398
How come?

10:44.836 --> 10:46.269
Because I saw you.

10:47.671 --> 10:48.938
I saw the Banshee.

10:48.972 --> 10:51.440
But I guess it was just a
dream or a hallucination.

10:52.876 --> 10:54.043
What was I doing?

10:54.845 --> 10:56.779
Trying to keep me alive.

10:56.813 --> 11:01.951
Well, sorry, but the Banshee was
mostly trying to stay out the rain.

11:04.487 --> 11:06.888
That was the night of the storm, remember?

11:07.790 --> 11:08.790
The Wild Hunt.

11:09.625 --> 11:11.059
The what?

11:11.093 --> 11:13.027
Oh, it's something Kira was telling me.

11:13.763 --> 11:16.131
A myth about thunderstorms...

11:16.165 --> 11:18.466
Ghost Riders in the sky and black dogs...

11:22.638 --> 11:24.271
What is it?

11:24.305 --> 11:26.539
I need to check on something.

11:26.574 --> 11:28.475
I'll be right back. Don't go anywhere.

11:30.812 --> 11:32.012
You know what I mean.

11:35.183 --> 11:36.516
It's not working, is it?

11:36.550 --> 11:39.086
She should be showing signs of improvement.

11:39.887 --> 11:41.353
Hayden?

11:41.822 --> 11:42.922
Call Val...

11:43.623 --> 11:46.492
My sister... Valerie.

11:46.994 --> 11:48.161
She's a deputy.

11:48.195 --> 11:49.338
I think I might know where she is.

11:49.362 --> 11:50.740
Theo just texted me about the high school.

11:50.764 --> 11:51.875
He said there's cops everywhere.

11:51.899 --> 11:52.899
Might be another Chimera.

11:53.366 --> 11:54.767
Um, my sister...

11:55.936 --> 11:57.502
I don't want to die without my sister.

11:58.004 --> 11:59.971
I'll get her.

12:00.006 --> 12:02.607
Uh, wait. What are you going to tell her?

12:02.641 --> 12:04.542
If I have to, I'll tell her everything.

12:09.048 --> 12:11.616
You want me to go in with you?

12:11.650 --> 12:14.384
No, it's okay. It's probably
going to take a while.

12:22.527 --> 12:24.528
Are you going to tell him about Donovan?

12:28.633 --> 12:29.633
You knew?

12:30.335 --> 12:31.367
I guessed.

12:32.703 --> 12:35.305
I saw the bite on your shoulder
while you were sleeping.

12:40.544 --> 12:42.212
It didn't matter to me.

12:45.015 --> 12:46.649
That's why I never said anything.

12:49.719 --> 12:51.153
It matters to me.

13:40.867 --> 13:42.401
Sheriff left half an hour ago.

13:42.435 --> 13:44.904
He said he was on his way back.

13:44.938 --> 13:47.239
Okay, thanks. I'll just wait in his office.

13:56.982 --> 13:58.482
"Woden's Hunt,

13:58.517 --> 14:01.652
"also known as the Wild Ride or Wild Hunt.

14:01.686 --> 14:03.754
"A myth of devilish riders in the sky

14:03.789 --> 14:05.656
"accompanied by black dogs,

14:05.690 --> 14:09.027
"spectral beasts whose
eyes glowed with fire,

14:09.061 --> 14:10.361
"A Bearer of Death

14:10.396 --> 14:12.363
"and Guardian of the Supernatural,

14:12.398 --> 14:14.164
"the black dog is also known

14:14.198 --> 14:15.565
"by its more common name...

14:17.035 --> 14:18.201
"The Hellhound."

14:35.518 --> 14:37.653
You know what's coming.

14:39.022 --> 14:40.589
Don't you?

14:40.623 --> 14:42.724
Someone's going to die here.

14:42.759 --> 14:43.759
You're right.

14:45.329 --> 14:46.662
But I can't let you tell anyone.

14:47.063 --> 14:48.263
Why?

14:49.165 --> 14:51.066
Because I want you, Lydia.

14:51.100 --> 14:52.467
I want all of you.

14:52.501 --> 14:54.002
What are you talking about?

14:54.036 --> 14:56.204
Don't worry.

14:56.238 --> 14:57.918
I'll give you some time to think about it.

15:47.385 --> 15:48.751
How did you do that?

15:56.227 --> 15:57.427
It's on her neck too.

15:58.596 --> 16:00.630
She's getting worse, isn't she?

16:00.665 --> 16:02.899
Yeah. Which is why we're
taking her to the hospital.

16:02.933 --> 16:04.333
How's that going to help?

16:04.367 --> 16:07.007
We're in an animal clinic and I
need equipment designed for humans.

16:07.036 --> 16:08.781
I said that we're going to
take her to the hospital.

16:08.805 --> 16:10.685
I didn't say we're going
through the front door.

16:11.641 --> 16:13.108
Hey, what's going on?

16:13.142 --> 16:14.476
Somebody hit the fire alarm?

16:26.021 --> 16:27.021
Do you want to learn?

16:27.989 --> 16:29.324
I can show you.

16:29.358 --> 16:30.891
You're showing me plenty right now.

16:32.561 --> 16:34.529
I've got nothing to hide.

16:37.333 --> 16:38.765
And I do?

16:38.799 --> 16:40.959
Did you tell Scott you're
planning to kill your mother?

16:42.470 --> 16:43.547
Don't worry, I'm not judging.

16:43.571 --> 16:45.539
I want to help you. Why?

16:46.207 --> 16:48.242
Because I know Scott won't.

16:48.276 --> 16:50.810
I'm trying to help all of you.

16:50.845 --> 16:53.257
If Scott can't do it, then someone
else needs to take the lead.

16:53.281 --> 16:55.401
You know they're moving
Hayden to the hospital, right?

16:56.015 --> 16:58.351
But Hayden's still a Chimera,

16:58.385 --> 16:59.562
and there's two more we haven't found yet,

16:59.586 --> 17:01.387
and they're still dangerous.

17:02.856 --> 17:04.390
They need help.

17:06.092 --> 17:07.760
They need you.

17:36.521 --> 17:37.988
What the hell...

17:38.022 --> 17:39.767
Wait, wait, wait...
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

17:39.791 --> 17:41.258
Get back! Stay out of his way.

18:18.894 --> 18:19.961
What's happening?

18:21.029 --> 18:22.663
I'm not sure.

18:22.698 --> 18:23.964
But it's definitely not good.

18:28.303 --> 18:29.403
My sister...

18:33.975 --> 18:37.244
Scott's out looking for her right now.

18:37.278 --> 18:39.979
He's going to bring her here
as soon as he can, all right?

18:51.792 --> 18:52.892
Hey, Lydia?

19:38.669 --> 19:40.537
That's not possible.

19:40.571 --> 19:42.238
You're right.

19:42.273 --> 19:44.908
A werewolf shouldn't even be
able to touch mountain ash.

19:46.342 --> 19:47.510
You're a Chimera.

19:47.544 --> 19:49.044
I'm the first Chimera.

19:50.480 --> 19:52.147
It's the coyote part you don't notice.

19:54.350 --> 19:55.718
It's why Malia trusted me first,

19:55.752 --> 19:58.387
even though she probably didn't know it.

19:58.422 --> 20:01.457
You found the perfect word though, Scott.

20:01.491 --> 20:05.326
Because a Chimera isn't just
a monster with different parts.

20:05.360 --> 20:07.495
It can also mean something
impossible to achieve.

20:07.530 --> 20:09.163
An unrealizable dream.

20:10.265 --> 20:11.633
And they realized you?

20:11.667 --> 20:13.601
They came close with me.

20:13.636 --> 20:15.102
But we can't all be perfect.

20:16.639 --> 20:18.005
We can't all be true Alphas.

20:24.679 --> 20:27.080
Damn. I felt that.

20:30.017 --> 20:32.052
No calls, Scott.

20:32.086 --> 20:35.088
No Stiles, no Malia, no Lydia.

20:36.523 --> 20:39.559
You're just going to have to wait
here alone for what happens next.

20:39.593 --> 20:41.026
What do you mean?

20:42.529 --> 20:43.696
What's next?

20:44.531 --> 20:45.698
The Supermoon.

20:57.643 --> 20:59.177
Over here, yeah.

20:59.212 --> 21:00.990
Shouldn't we be talking
to one of the doctors?

21:01.014 --> 21:03.215
I've been wrestling with that for hours.

21:03.249 --> 21:04.383
Do we bring them in

21:04.417 --> 21:07.251
and watch them treat
her as a normal patient,

21:07.285 --> 21:10.421
while we stand here knowing
that's not going to work?

21:10.455 --> 21:13.457
Or do we keep trying everything
medically possible to save her,

21:13.492 --> 21:16.960
while her body does things that
shouldn't be medically possible?

21:17.529 --> 21:19.130
Is she dying?

21:19.164 --> 21:21.932
With the amount of mercury
in her body right now,

21:21.966 --> 21:23.299
she shouldn't even be alive.

21:37.381 --> 21:38.381
Come on...

21:40.183 --> 21:41.943
You've done this before.
You can do it again.

23:32.523 --> 23:33.623
Wolfsbane.

23:49.572 --> 23:50.572
Theo let you in.

23:52.675 --> 23:54.276
Did you lie to me?

23:54.943 --> 23:56.610
I've never lied to you.

23:56.645 --> 23:58.412
But you won't save her.

23:58.446 --> 24:00.281
I can't save her.

24:00.915 --> 24:03.184
At least, not with a bite.

24:03.218 --> 24:05.419
If you'd just think about
that for a second, Liam,

24:05.453 --> 24:06.420
you would know that I'm right.

24:06.454 --> 24:08.255
I am thinking!

24:09.624 --> 24:12.959
I'm thinking about alternatives.

24:12.994 --> 24:14.627
Liam, it's the Supermoon.

24:14.662 --> 24:16.540
It's feeding your anger. It's
making you more aggressive.

24:16.564 --> 24:18.298
It's making me stronger!

24:19.166 --> 24:21.267
You're gonna keep your promise.

24:21.902 --> 24:23.303
Even if it kills you!

24:28.008 --> 24:30.309
Oh, no, no, no, no...

24:33.713 --> 24:35.013
I think you better get Liam.

24:36.382 --> 24:38.550
What about Scott? He's not answering.

24:38.585 --> 24:41.320
And if Liam wants to be with
her, he needs to get here now.

24:41.354 --> 24:42.987
Because she's dying,

24:43.022 --> 24:44.889
and I don't know what else to do.

24:46.125 --> 24:48.792
Go. I will text you if anything changes.

24:48.827 --> 24:50.261
Just get him here, Mason.

24:51.230 --> 24:52.363
Go.

25:01.340 --> 25:02.806
Hey, Liam, stop.

25:02.841 --> 25:04.561
You're not going to save her by killing me.

26:06.066 --> 26:07.801
What the hell was that?

26:44.991 --> 26:46.435
I don't know what's going on around here,

26:46.459 --> 26:48.092
but I'm guessing things are bad again.

26:48.127 --> 26:49.160
Very.

26:49.194 --> 26:51.029
Then this is going to sound worse.

26:51.063 --> 26:52.531
'Cause your plan...

26:52.565 --> 26:54.332
She knows. Yeah.

26:54.366 --> 26:56.234
And she's coming.

26:56.268 --> 26:59.203
The Desert Wolf knows you're alive.

26:59.238 --> 27:01.272
And she's coming back to Beacon Hills.

27:04.409 --> 27:05.476
Come on, come on...

27:12.884 --> 27:14.395
Sorry. I got here as fast as I could...

27:14.419 --> 27:16.096
We gotta go. Now. Parrish
has got the bodies.

27:16.120 --> 27:17.164
Okay, wait up... Stiles, wait.

27:17.188 --> 27:18.265
Parrish is out and he's got the bodies.

27:18.289 --> 27:19.666
We've got to find Scott.
And we've got to tell him.

27:19.690 --> 27:20.690
Stiles!

27:22.092 --> 27:24.193
I don't think Scott wants
to talk to you right now.

27:24.227 --> 27:25.439
Yeah, thanks, I'm aware of that.

27:25.463 --> 27:26.807
It doesn't matter. He
needs to know about this.

27:26.831 --> 27:28.064
Stiles...

27:29.399 --> 27:31.534
Scott doesn't want to talk to you.

27:34.237 --> 27:35.972
But I think your dad does.

28:18.980 --> 28:20.446
Don't do this, Liam!

28:24.084 --> 28:25.519
I can't let you kill me.

28:51.143 --> 28:52.623
Your dad was looking for you, Stiles.

28:53.879 --> 28:55.312
He found me instead.

28:56.815 --> 28:57.815
Where is he?

28:59.117 --> 29:01.052
I covered for you.

29:01.086 --> 29:03.486
This was taken care of.

29:03.521 --> 29:05.488
If Melissa didn't find
it at the hospital...

29:05.523 --> 29:07.558
Guess even the son of
a cop can make mistakes.

29:08.960 --> 29:09.993
Did you hurt him?

29:13.064 --> 29:15.699
I never lied about why
I came to Beacon Hills.

29:18.036 --> 29:19.268
I'm here for a pack.

29:20.804 --> 29:23.472
I came for the werecoyote.

29:23.506 --> 29:26.676
The one whose first instinct is to kill.

29:26.710 --> 29:29.411
I came for the Banshee, the
girl surrounded by death.

29:29.446 --> 29:31.246
I came for the dark Kitsune,

29:32.082 --> 29:33.092
the Beta with anger issues...

29:33.116 --> 29:34.917
I came for Void Stiles.

29:34.952 --> 29:36.184
That's the pack I want.

29:38.387 --> 29:40.354
Unfortunately, it doesn't include Scott.

29:43.859 --> 29:45.493
Your heartbeat's rising, Stiles.

29:46.929 --> 29:48.463
It's not because you're afraid.

29:49.031 --> 29:51.332
Nogitsune is gone,

29:51.366 --> 29:53.766
but you've still got more blood
on your hands than any of us.

29:54.903 --> 29:56.203
I'm about to get more.

30:24.098 --> 30:26.065
I'll tell you where your dad is,

30:27.366 --> 30:29.134
if you promise not to help Scott.

30:33.106 --> 30:34.405
There he is!

30:35.274 --> 30:36.975
That's Void Stiles.

30:37.010 --> 30:38.376
It felt good, didn't it?

30:47.886 --> 30:49.253
We won't tell Scott.

30:50.622 --> 30:53.257
'Cause you can't lose
your best friend, right?

30:53.291 --> 30:55.131
Even though we both know,
you never needed him.

30:58.764 --> 31:00.830
You hate me now, but
you'll get it eventually.

31:02.099 --> 31:03.900
This is the hard part.

31:03.934 --> 31:06.736
'Cause you can't help Scott
and save your dad's life.

31:09.140 --> 31:10.674
You've still got time, Stiles.

31:12.143 --> 31:13.442
You've still got time.

31:31.127 --> 31:32.427
He's using you, Liam.

31:33.697 --> 31:35.629
He wants you to be the Alpha

31:35.664 --> 31:37.999
because he can't take the power from me.

31:38.033 --> 31:39.200
Only you can.

31:40.869 --> 31:42.236
But once you do,

31:42.270 --> 31:44.438
he'll take it from you.

31:44.472 --> 31:46.507
That's why he wants you to kill me...

31:46.541 --> 31:47.875
That's what you don't get, Scott.

31:48.811 --> 31:50.311
I want to kill you.

31:50.946 --> 31:52.145
I want to!

32:54.239 --> 32:55.372
Liam!

32:56.975 --> 32:58.041
Liam!

32:58.076 --> 32:59.209
Liam!

33:00.010 --> 33:01.077
Liam!

33:07.751 --> 33:09.185
Liam, what are you doing?

33:15.092 --> 33:16.625
Hayden.

33:16.660 --> 33:17.660
She's gone.

33:20.029 --> 33:21.562
Hayden died a few minutes ago.

33:23.032 --> 33:24.032
She's gone.

33:51.204 --> 33:52.805
Scott...

33:53.273 --> 33:54.907
What happened?

33:54.942 --> 33:56.609
It's the Supermoon.

33:56.643 --> 33:58.911
- It was just...
- Bad timing.

33:58.946 --> 34:01.613
I mean, seriously. You couldn't
have waited five minutes?

34:05.317 --> 34:06.618
I should've stayed.

34:07.319 --> 34:09.688
I should've made sure.

34:09.722 --> 34:12.223
Because now you have to kill me yourself.

34:12.257 --> 34:13.625
They're still mine.

34:13.659 --> 34:15.927
Maybe not yet, but they'll come around.

34:15.962 --> 34:16.962
Not for you.

34:23.534 --> 34:24.835
They're not like you.

34:26.370 --> 34:27.871
They never will be.

34:28.773 --> 34:29.907
Because I'm a Chimera?

34:32.110 --> 34:33.944
Because I'm not a real werewolf?

34:35.413 --> 34:37.413
Because you're barely even human.

36:09.101 --> 36:11.368
Scott! Scott!

36:15.407 --> 36:16.908
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...

36:19.043 --> 36:20.043
Okay.

36:21.813 --> 36:23.914
What...

36:23.948 --> 36:26.282
One, two, three, four,
five... What are you doing?

36:26.317 --> 36:28.218
Six, seven, eight...

36:28.252 --> 36:29.252
What are you doing?

36:29.286 --> 36:30.587
Bringing him back.

36:30.621 --> 36:31.988
But his... His heart. He...

36:33.758 --> 36:35.591
He hasn't had a pulse in over 15 minutes.

36:35.625 --> 36:38.194
You can't bring someone back that's...

36:38.228 --> 36:40.062
He's not someone. He's my son.

36:40.097 --> 36:41.263
And he's an Alpha.

36:41.297 --> 36:43.265
And he's too strong to die like this!

36:43.299 --> 36:44.867
Come on!

36:44.901 --> 36:46.668
Open your eyes and look at me, okay?

36:46.703 --> 36:48.838
Come on. Breathe, baby. Breathe.

36:52.641 --> 36:55.176
Melissa, it's... Shut up!

36:55.211 --> 36:56.677
He's too strong to die like this.

36:58.647 --> 37:01.015
Come on. You can do this. You're an Alpha.

37:02.417 --> 37:03.785
You're an Alpha.

37:06.021 --> 37:07.421
Come on, Scott. Roar.

37:08.357 --> 37:09.556
Come on!

37:09.590 --> 37:11.925
Come on, Scott. Roar!

37:36.850 --> 37:38.785
I've never done this before, Lydia.

37:38.819 --> 37:40.186
I know how dangerous it is.

37:40.220 --> 37:42.060
But it's a risk we have
to take. No, no, don't!

37:45.024 --> 37:46.524
What do you think, Lydia?

37:46.558 --> 37:48.059
Am I doing it right?

37:51.363 --> 37:52.497
Yes, I see it...

37:54.901 --> 37:55.901
I can see it.

38:17.922 --> 38:19.122
I lost, Mom.

38:22.492 --> 38:24.093
Every leader suffers loss.

38:26.030 --> 38:28.531
Sometimes more than you think is bearable.

38:29.633 --> 38:31.201
But this time, I lost everyone.

38:33.503 --> 38:35.003
You'll get them back.

38:35.038 --> 38:36.104
You have to.

38:38.641 --> 38:40.142
Why would they come back?

38:41.945 --> 38:44.980
Because you're their leader.

38:45.014 --> 38:47.515
And even when a leader thinks
they have nothing left to give,

38:48.651 --> 38:50.052
there's still one thing.

38:55.423 --> 38:56.557
Hope.

38:58.293 --> 38:59.526
Give them hope.

39:02.630 --> 39:04.098
Come on, Lydia.

39:05.400 --> 39:06.400
Come on.

39:12.639 --> 39:14.074
Watch this, Lydia.

39:17.845 --> 39:19.246
You think you lost your mind?

39:20.681 --> 39:21.681
Well, watch this!

40:03.821 --> 40:05.188
What... What's happening?

40:05.623 --> 40:07.124
Who are you?

40:07.158 --> 40:08.292
I'm your Alpha.

40:09.794 --> 40:11.061
And all of you...

40:12.596 --> 40:14.231
All of you belong to me.

40:54.502 --> 40:56.003
La Bete.

40:58.473 --> 41:00.007
La Bete.

41:01.309 --> 41:02.343
La Bete.

41:03.611 --> 41:04.845
La Bete...

41:06.848 --> 41:08.247
Success.
