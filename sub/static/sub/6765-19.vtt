WEBVTT

00:07.370 --> 00:10.825
Oh, damn, it's good to be home.

00:10.870 --> 00:13.359
Well, don't get
too comfortable yet.

00:13.405 --> 00:14.735
l've got a surprise for you.

00:14.772 --> 00:16.897
Picking me up at the airport,

00:16.939 --> 00:18.269
that was surprise enough.

00:20.407 --> 00:21.896
Well, you know,
l kind of figured

00:21.941 --> 00:24.100
that you probably had
airplane food for dinner,

00:24.142 --> 00:26.608
so, uh, l think you deserve
a nice homemade dessert.

00:26.643 --> 00:28.541
Oh, that's nice.

00:28.577 --> 00:31.009
What's the catch?

00:31.078 --> 00:32.374
There's no catch.

00:32.411 --> 00:34.036
l'm just glad you're home.

00:35.879 --> 00:39.437
So, what did you and Erica do
in the Aloha State?

00:39.481 --> 00:42.004
Well, mostly we just hung
out with lris. You know...

00:42.082 --> 00:44.674
No snorkeling, no hula dancing?

00:44.716 --> 00:46.205
lt wasn't exactly
a pleasure trip,

00:46.250 --> 00:47.341
you know what l mean?

00:47.384 --> 00:49.009
And l'm not exactly parent
material.

00:49.118 --> 00:50.015
So l figured,

00:50.118 --> 00:53.949
if Erica could get
along with lris...

00:53.986 --> 00:56.009
How could anyone not get along
with lris?

00:56.120 --> 00:57.915
lt's possible, believe me.

00:57.954 --> 01:01.443
But they hit it off and Erica
loves it there, so...

01:01.489 --> 01:04.456
And they live
happily ever after.

01:04.489 --> 01:05.477
Yeah.

01:07.591 --> 01:10.716
Well, now that everything's
fallen into place,

01:10.759 --> 01:14.123
don't you think
it's payback time?

01:14.160 --> 01:15.626
What's on your mind?

01:17.628 --> 01:21.322
Well, l know how important it
was to get Erica back safely.

01:21.362 --> 01:22.487
Right.

01:22.529 --> 01:25.962
And we did recover a payload
of money in Mexico.

01:25.997 --> 01:27.520
Spit it out.

01:27.565 --> 01:31.965
Well, three people worked
that job: me, you and Jones,

01:32.066 --> 01:33.259
but only two people got paid.

01:33.300 --> 01:37.165
Okay. l get your point.

01:37.202 --> 01:39.464
After all, you did risk
your life down there.

01:39.503 --> 01:43.095
Not to mention my virtue.

01:43.137 --> 01:45.433
Right.

01:45.472 --> 01:47.370
Okay, l'll cut you in.

01:47.405 --> 01:49.769
l guess l should've thought
about that before.

01:49.806 --> 01:52.204
Well, l know you've had a lot
on your mind.

01:53.508 --> 01:56.838
But now that l have your
attention...

01:58.000 --> 02:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:07.934 --> 03:08.865
Oh. Hi, Brandon.

03:08.934 --> 03:10.423
Hey, Chief,
thanks for coming.

03:10.468 --> 03:11.456
Not a problem.

03:11.503 --> 03:13.264
You know, we could've just done
this over the phone.

03:13.302 --> 03:15.325
Jesse's leaving for his
recruiting trip tomorrow.

03:15.370 --> 03:16.859
He owes me babysitting time.

03:16.937 --> 03:19.495
Jesse's going out of town, and
you're sitting here with me?

03:19.538 --> 03:22.266
He is so nervous
about these interviews,

03:22.306 --> 03:23.863
it makes me edgy
just being around him.

03:23.974 --> 03:26.634
What's going on?

03:26.674 --> 03:27.867
l need some input on this

03:27.908 --> 03:30.739
and you're the best
editor l know, so...

03:33.910 --> 03:35.842
''ln Defense of Professor
Finley''?

03:35.878 --> 03:38.037
lt's for Friday's ''Condor.''

03:38.079 --> 03:39.045
l don't get it.

03:39.079 --> 03:40.477
You have a showdown with this
guy last week

03:40.513 --> 03:42.274
and now you want to help him
get tenure?

03:42.313 --> 03:45.473
Personally, l think the guy's
an egomaniac,

03:45.515 --> 03:47.572
but he does have a lot
of devoted students.

03:47.615 --> 03:49.240
Huh.

03:49.282 --> 03:51.874
Well, then l guess it makes good
sense to back him,

03:51.984 --> 03:54.746
not to mention good politics.

03:56.185 --> 03:59.277
l do have another reason
for standing up for him.

03:59.319 --> 04:02.752
A certain blond psychology
student we both know?

04:02.787 --> 04:05.117
Yeah.

04:05.155 --> 04:07.485
Brandon, has she read this?

04:07.523 --> 04:12.354
No, in fact, l haven't even told
her l'm doing it yet.

04:14.025 --> 04:17.355
We haven't been spending a lot
of quality time together lately.

04:22.995 --> 04:25.553
Well, with the Faculty Council
meeting on Friday,

04:25.595 --> 04:27.288
we're starting tonight with the
phone tree,

04:27.329 --> 04:28.727
telling everybody
about the rally on Friday

04:28.763 --> 04:30.286
and we need your help.

04:30.330 --> 04:32.990
Oh, great.
Okay, come on over. Bye.

04:33.031 --> 04:34.997
You are not gonna believe
what happened to me.

04:35.032 --> 04:36.157
Donna, what are you doing here?

04:36.199 --> 04:37.688
You're supposed
to be at the Peach Pit.

04:37.733 --> 04:39.562
Hah! l was making
a quick stop home

04:39.600 --> 04:41.759
and a pizza delivery guy
rear-ended me and then he yelled

04:41.801 --> 04:44.029
at me because l didn't
run the red light.

04:44.068 --> 04:45.658
Now, l'm totally late,
Ray's waiting for me.

04:45.702 --> 04:46.668
l've gotta call him.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.192
l think all the lines are busy.

04:48.237 --> 04:50.328
-Who are all these people?
-Finley students.

04:50.371 --> 04:51.769
Are you gonna come
to the rally on Friday?

04:51.804 --> 04:53.599
l just want to call
the Peach Pit.

04:53.639 --> 04:55.264
Great. Thanks for your support.

04:55.306 --> 04:56.329
Oh, thanks, l just...

04:56.373 --> 04:58.168
Sorry. l haven't
finished my list yet.

04:58.207 --> 04:59.832
l need the phone!

04:59.908 --> 05:01.431
Well, she'll be done
in a second.

05:01.475 --> 05:03.771
But that's my phone!
This is an emergency!

05:03.809 --> 05:05.775
Donna, why don't you go use
my car phone?

05:05.809 --> 05:06.968
Why doesn't she go use
your car phone?!

05:07.011 --> 05:08.772
l live here,
did you forget that?

05:08.844 --> 05:09.775
Fine.

05:09.845 --> 05:11.674
Thank you.

05:11.712 --> 05:13.405
Save Finley.

05:13.446 --> 05:14.707
So, how's the mobilization
going?

05:14.747 --> 05:15.735
Great.

05:15.780 --> 05:17.041
l feel so energized by this.

05:17.080 --> 05:18.705
You know what?
l think we can win.

05:18.748 --> 05:19.714
Gather a little courage,

05:19.748 --> 05:21.441
it's amazing
what a mere mortal can do.

05:21.482 --> 05:23.107
So, to what do l owe
the pleasure?

05:23.149 --> 05:24.547
Well, l've got a little research

05:24.583 --> 05:26.106
l was hoping we could discuss
tomorrow.

05:26.150 --> 05:27.616
Do you want to meet for coffee?

05:27.651 --> 05:28.742
How about lunch?

05:28.785 --> 05:30.944
Give me that!

05:30.985 --> 05:31.951
Perfect.

05:31.986 --> 05:33.747
l want to hear all about
the group's progress.

05:33.787 --> 05:35.185
Okay, tomorrow, then?

05:35.221 --> 05:36.244
Tomorrow.

05:36.288 --> 05:37.276
All right.

05:42.657 --> 05:44.486
lt's cold in here...

05:44.524 --> 05:48.651
Yeah, it is.
Here, put this coat on.

05:48.692 --> 05:53.058
Well, this coat has definitely
seen better winters.

05:53.093 --> 05:55.355
Beverly Hills doesn't have
a very good selection

05:55.395 --> 05:56.383
of winter coats.

05:56.428 --> 06:00.555
But if you go to Fred's,
you can get something.

06:00.596 --> 06:01.926
Okay, well...

06:01.963 --> 06:05.361
But don't you think l need
something to buy it with?

06:05.398 --> 06:08.229
Oh, we're back
to that topic again?

06:08.265 --> 06:10.254
Do you think maybe you can write
me a check before l go?

06:10.300 --> 06:11.732
Sure.

06:21.571 --> 06:24.094
You're getting out of bed
and l'm writing a check.

06:24.138 --> 06:25.967
Out of context,

06:26.005 --> 06:27.732
that wouldn't look so good.

06:27.806 --> 06:29.033
Well, the fun was for free.

06:29.073 --> 06:31.665
lt's the work
l want to get paid for.

06:31.707 --> 06:33.332
Well, this ought to buy you

06:33.374 --> 06:36.499
the warmest winter coat
you've ever seen.

06:39.211 --> 06:40.972
$10,000?

06:41.010 --> 06:44.238
ls this, like,
the first installment?

06:44.278 --> 06:46.335
That's a lot of money.

06:46.379 --> 06:49.937
Well, compared to the millions
you came away with, it isn't.

06:49.981 --> 06:51.606
So what did you expect?

06:51.648 --> 06:54.308
Well, haven't you ever heard
of maybe

06:54.349 --> 06:55.474
''equal pay for equal work''?

06:55.516 --> 06:57.482
l've heard of ''greed.''

06:57.517 --> 06:59.745
Obviously,
something you know about.

06:59.817 --> 07:01.840
Are you out of your mind?

07:01.885 --> 07:04.408
Why, because l'm standing up
for what l have coming to me?

07:04.452 --> 07:06.680
No, because if you want a piece
of the action,

07:06.753 --> 07:09.913
that's a deal you make before
it goes down, not after.

07:09.955 --> 07:12.786
You're the one who assumed
that my services were voluntary.

07:12.822 --> 07:15.448
Your services
have been paid for.

07:15.489 --> 07:16.614
Take it or leave it.

07:19.425 --> 07:21.288
Fine.

07:22.526 --> 07:25.118
Thanks for nothing.

07:29.128 --> 07:30.094
Clare, right?

07:30.128 --> 07:32.060
l'm Ariel Hunter.

07:32.096 --> 07:35.927
''Firestorm Music,
Artists and Repertoire.'' Wow.

07:35.964 --> 07:37.021
David, this is...

07:37.065 --> 07:38.554
Ariel. How you doing?

07:38.599 --> 07:40.189
Hey, David.

07:40.233 --> 07:43.688
Old acquaintances?

07:43.800 --> 07:44.925
Yeah.

07:44.968 --> 07:45.956
Oh.

07:46.001 --> 07:47.660
So you two are running
this place, huh?

07:47.702 --> 07:50.692
What happened to performing?

07:50.736 --> 07:52.463
lt's on the back burner.

07:52.503 --> 07:53.867
So what brings you here?

07:53.904 --> 07:55.802
Uh, actually, Ray Pruit.

07:55.838 --> 07:57.701
l was hoping
to get an introduction.

07:57.738 --> 07:59.102
Sure. Let's do it.

07:59.138 --> 08:01.036
Great.

08:01.073 --> 08:02.437
See ya, David.

08:02.473 --> 08:03.734
See ya.

08:03.773 --> 08:06.239
Where's Clare taking
my little paramour?

08:06.275 --> 08:09.400
She wants to meet Ray.

08:09.443 --> 08:12.035
Musicians get all the women.
lt kills me!

08:12.077 --> 08:14.600
Yeah, it's gonna
kill Donna, too.

08:14.645 --> 08:16.372
Look, Donna, l'm sorry
about your accident,

08:16.411 --> 08:18.104
but of all nights
to forget my shirt.

08:18.145 --> 08:19.735
You know, l was sweating
buckets out there.

08:19.779 --> 08:22.439
l'm sorry, but it's not like l
wanted to spend the last hour

08:22.480 --> 08:24.446
on the phone
with the insurance company.

08:24.481 --> 08:25.572
Look, it's fine, all right?
Just forget it.

08:25.615 --> 08:26.512
lt's over now.

08:26.549 --> 08:29.209
Look, l gotta go, okay?

08:29.250 --> 08:30.773
-Bye.
-All right.

08:30.817 --> 08:32.942
There's someone here to see you.

08:34.418 --> 08:35.850
Thanks, Clare.
lt was nice meeting you.

08:35.885 --> 08:37.249
You, too.

08:37.285 --> 08:40.253
Hi, l'm Ariel Hunter
from Firestorm Music.

08:40.287 --> 08:41.775
-You're the A&R rep?
-Mm-hmm.

08:41.821 --> 08:43.446
l thought you flaked out on me.

08:43.488 --> 08:44.920
l said l'd come by.

08:44.955 --> 08:46.478
l'm a woman of my word.

08:46.522 --> 08:47.920
Here, have a seat.

08:47.956 --> 08:49.252
Thanks.

08:50.857 --> 08:52.550
l liked your show.

08:52.591 --> 08:54.648
l hear a lot of classic rock
in you.

08:54.759 --> 08:56.248
Yeah, yeah.

08:56.293 --> 08:59.158
l grew up listening
to Graham Parker, Mellencamp,

08:59.194 --> 09:00.353
a little Joe Cocker.

09:00.394 --> 09:02.587
So you get by with a little help
from your friends?

09:02.629 --> 09:04.595
Uh, listen,

09:04.630 --> 09:06.391
l really do think
your music is pretty great.

09:06.429 --> 09:09.453
Thanks. Do you say that
to all the guys you scout?

09:09.497 --> 09:11.986
No, as a matter of fact,

09:12.032 --> 09:14.021
l rarely stick around
to meet with them afterwards.

09:14.065 --> 09:16.190
lt gets their hopes up,
you know what l mean?

09:16.233 --> 09:18.426
But when l see someone

09:18.468 --> 09:21.264
l like, well,
then l come backstage,

09:21.302 --> 09:23.860
l interrupt phone conversations,
quote old lyrics,

09:23.902 --> 09:24.993
try to make them laugh.

09:26.404 --> 09:28.563
And then l invite them up
to Firestorm

09:28.604 --> 09:30.263
to meet with my boss,
Terry Dixon.

09:30.305 --> 09:31.293
Terry Dixon.

09:31.338 --> 09:33.133
-You've heard of him, huh?
-Yeah.

09:33.172 --> 09:34.797
Yeah, he's a heavyweight.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.965
-He's signed a lot of great
people. -That's right.

09:37.008 --> 09:39.236
And it's my job
to keep up his reputation.

09:39.275 --> 09:40.798
So...

09:40.842 --> 09:42.069
will you come in for a meeting?

09:42.110 --> 09:43.542
Yeah.

09:43.577 --> 09:44.600
Hell, yeah.

09:44.677 --> 09:46.109
Great.

09:58.815 --> 10:01.213
Jesse, she's still having
a tough time breathing.

10:01.249 --> 10:03.545
Let's put her back in the
bathroom and steam her up.

10:03.584 --> 10:05.050
No, l want her
to stay sleeping.

10:05.084 --> 10:07.607
God, l wish l didn't have to go.

10:07.652 --> 10:10.118
Then don't.

10:10.153 --> 10:12.016
Honey, l can't cancel
my interviews.

10:12.053 --> 10:13.280
You want me to clerk

10:13.321 --> 10:14.844
for a federal appeals judge,
don't you?

10:14.888 --> 10:17.719
Only if you're based
in San Francisco.

10:17.756 --> 10:18.983
Think Boise.

10:19.023 --> 10:20.182
Don't say that.

10:20.223 --> 10:21.984
They're already talking
of Judge Jimenez

10:22.024 --> 10:23.614
as a possible
Supreme Court nominee.

10:23.691 --> 10:26.157
Look, if l could hook my
cart on to that horse,

10:26.191 --> 10:28.089
we could all be in
for quite a ride.

10:29.760 --> 10:32.352
Ah, l wish that pediatrician
would call back already.

10:32.394 --> 10:33.951
Ah, sweetheart...

10:33.994 --> 10:36.893
you know you can always take
her to the emergency room.

10:36.928 --> 10:38.587
Jesse, l'm not gonna
take her out in the cold

10:38.629 --> 10:41.152
so that we can just sit and wait
for hours for her to be seen.

10:41.197 --> 10:44.721
Why don't you give that med
student you know a call?

10:44.765 --> 10:46.560
Who, Peter?

10:46.599 --> 10:49.031
Yeah, give him a call if
you need some reassurance.

10:50.367 --> 10:51.856
There's my shuttle.

10:51.901 --> 10:53.265
Here you go, sweetie.

10:53.302 --> 10:55.234
Listen, l promise
l will call you

10:55.269 --> 10:56.928
as soon as l get there,
all right?

10:56.970 --> 10:58.163
Good luck.

10:58.203 --> 11:00.635
l love you.

11:02.104 --> 11:05.162
All right, we'll call.

11:05.205 --> 11:07.694
All right.

11:07.740 --> 11:10.468
Hello, is, uh,
Dr. Peter Tucker there?

11:10.508 --> 11:11.997
-No.
-ls he on call?

11:12.042 --> 11:14.338
-Can you hold?
-Yes, l'll... l'll hold on.

11:16.410 --> 11:18.842
Don't look at me like that.

11:20.978 --> 11:24.536
The rally tomorrow night is
going to be quite a spectacle.

11:24.579 --> 11:25.977
Good luck, Professor Finley.

11:26.013 --> 11:27.377
Defy externs.

11:27.414 --> 11:28.539
You got it.

11:28.580 --> 11:30.103
lf only the university
were a democracy.

11:30.148 --> 11:31.841
We'd capture the popular
vote by a landslide.

11:31.882 --> 11:33.280
Hello, stranger.

11:33.316 --> 11:35.578
We, uh, we haven't seen you
over at the house lately.

11:35.650 --> 11:37.582
Not to mention not
returning my phone calls.

11:37.651 --> 11:40.311
Well, l haven't had a chance
to check my voice mail.

11:40.352 --> 11:42.147
Cindy Walsh,

11:42.186 --> 11:43.516
this is Professor Finley.

11:44.553 --> 11:46.212
Proud mother of Brandon?

11:46.254 --> 11:48.720
As a matter of fact.

11:48.754 --> 11:50.515
Uh, Professor,
what do l have to do

11:50.555 --> 11:52.248
to steal ten minutes
of her time, huh?

11:52.289 --> 11:54.812
Brandon, you know
we've been really busy

11:54.857 --> 11:56.118
with the tenure fight.

11:56.158 --> 11:57.885
Yeah, l know.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.823
See ya.

11:59.858 --> 12:02.552
-Bye.
-Bye.

12:02.593 --> 12:06.082
You were a little frosty
with Mr. Walsh, weren't you?

12:06.127 --> 12:07.320
Yeah, we're having our problems.

12:07.362 --> 12:09.521
Something l can help you with?

12:09.595 --> 12:12.789
Actually, it has to do with you.

12:12.830 --> 12:14.091
Tell me.

12:14.130 --> 12:15.255
l don't want to bore you

12:15.297 --> 12:16.956
with the blow-by-blow
of my personal life.

12:16.998 --> 12:19.191
Kelly, l'm a psychology
professor.

12:19.232 --> 12:20.528
This is my bread and butter.

12:20.566 --> 12:21.532
Feed me.

12:21.566 --> 12:24.192
Well, as you know,

12:24.234 --> 12:28.292
Brandon hasn't exactly been
on our side in this thing.

12:28.336 --> 12:30.529
-lt's put a little strain on us.
-That is a problem.

12:30.603 --> 12:32.626
You need all the support
you can get right now.

12:32.670 --> 12:34.932
Absolutely.
And you'd think my own boyfriend

12:34.971 --> 12:36.460
would be a little bit
more understanding.

12:36.505 --> 12:39.801
When the pressure's on,
people show their stripes.

12:41.240 --> 12:42.706
l guess so.

12:46.309 --> 12:48.639
David, we've gotta
make this quick.

12:48.676 --> 12:51.040
l have two chapters
of Gothic Architecture

12:51.078 --> 12:52.442
l've got to get through
before my next class.

12:52.478 --> 12:54.171
Yeah, l'm... l'm busy, too.

12:54.212 --> 12:55.769
l just thought this
was pretty important.

12:55.812 --> 12:58.278
Okay, l'm listening.

12:58.313 --> 13:01.109
lt's about Ray and, uh,

13:01.147 --> 13:03.443
and the A&R rep
that came by last night.

13:03.482 --> 13:05.948
Oh, right, from Firestorm Music.

13:05.982 --> 13:07.471
l'm so excited for him.

13:07.516 --> 13:09.277
-Yeah, it's a big break.
-Yeah.

13:09.317 --> 13:10.840
Listen, about the rep...

13:10.884 --> 13:13.077
Ray said she was really nice.

13:13.118 --> 13:14.379
Donna, would...

13:14.419 --> 13:16.146
would you listen, please?

13:17.487 --> 13:21.113
Look, the rep...

13:21.154 --> 13:24.348
the rep is, uh... is Ariel.

13:24.389 --> 13:26.116
Ariel?

13:26.156 --> 13:27.985
-David?
-Who's that?

13:28.024 --> 13:29.490
lt's Donna.

13:29.524 --> 13:31.581
-David, open up.
-What-what am l gonna do?

13:31.625 --> 13:33.250
l don't know, don't look at me.

13:33.292 --> 13:35.850
That Ariel?

13:35.893 --> 13:38.359
Yeah, unfortunately.

13:38.394 --> 13:40.292
Oh, my God.

13:40.328 --> 13:42.191
Look, l'm... l'm sorry l, uh,

13:42.229 --> 13:44.957
l just thought you should know.

13:50.366 --> 13:54.197
Excuse me, l just got a
sickening case of deja vu.

13:54.233 --> 13:55.358
l gotta go.

13:55.400 --> 13:58.594
-Donna...
-No, it's okay.

13:58.634 --> 14:00.827
Thanks for telling me.

14:11.139 --> 14:12.968
You're right.

14:13.006 --> 14:14.563
Ray, it was more
than a pleasure.

14:14.607 --> 14:17.073
l mean, your demo's a little
rough, but it's good stuff.

14:17.108 --> 14:19.199
Thanks. Really.

14:19.242 --> 14:21.504
-l think we'll be seeing you
again very soon. -All right.

14:23.877 --> 14:25.434
ls he hungry?

14:25.544 --> 14:27.442
-Starved.
-Good.

14:27.512 --> 14:28.603
Make the deal happen.

14:28.645 --> 14:31.578
You got it.

14:36.548 --> 14:37.571
l smell a deal brewing.

14:37.615 --> 14:39.604
l don't know about that.

14:39.649 --> 14:41.638
Would you stop it
with this modesty bit?

14:41.684 --> 14:43.014
He was very impressed.

14:43.051 --> 14:45.244
You know, you never
let yourself believe

14:45.284 --> 14:47.682
when you're sitting in
the back of your truck,

14:47.719 --> 14:49.208
plucking out a new song,

14:49.253 --> 14:51.276
that somebody's actually
going to hear it, you know,

14:51.321 --> 14:52.378
and like it.

14:52.421 --> 14:54.353
Sometimes fantasies come true.

14:54.389 --> 14:56.855
l better not get
ahead of myself

14:56.889 --> 14:58.912
until there's actually
an offer made.

14:58.957 --> 15:01.446
Well, l've got
an offer for you.

15:01.557 --> 15:03.716
Why don't you let me
take you shopping?

15:03.759 --> 15:04.747
For what?

15:04.792 --> 15:06.690
Well, how about
a new pair of boots?

15:06.726 --> 15:07.885
What's wrong with these?

15:07.926 --> 15:09.085
They're cool.

15:09.127 --> 15:12.582
They're just a little
past their prime.

15:12.628 --> 15:14.287
These boots have
sentimental value.

15:14.329 --> 15:16.522
l bought them with my first
construction paycheck.

15:16.562 --> 15:19.586
Well, there's nothing wrong with
having an extra pair, right?

15:19.630 --> 15:20.687
On us?

15:20.731 --> 15:22.197
Ariel, it's really
not necessary.

15:22.232 --> 15:24.994
Come on, Ray, don't make me beg.

15:25.032 --> 15:26.396
Well, we wouldn't want that.

15:26.466 --> 15:28.261
Great. Let's go.

15:35.703 --> 15:40.137
-Hey.
-Hey.

15:40.171 --> 15:41.830
l'm surprised you actually
made an appointment.

15:41.872 --> 15:44.532
Yeah, well, l'm getting kind
of formal on you.

15:45.573 --> 15:46.937
Come on in.

15:49.808 --> 15:52.104
So l hear congratulations
are in order.

15:52.143 --> 15:55.632
l'm glad Suzanne and Kevin
finally got what they deserved.

15:55.676 --> 15:56.835
Yeah, they should be
kicking back

15:56.878 --> 15:58.401
in a Mexican jail
right about now.

15:58.445 --> 16:01.378
Jim, l know if l'd listened
to you in the first place,

16:01.413 --> 16:04.312
that, uh, none of that
would've happened.

16:04.347 --> 16:06.506
Ah, it happens
to the best of us.

16:06.547 --> 16:07.945
lt's not gonna happen again.

16:07.981 --> 16:10.607
Which is why l'm here.

16:10.649 --> 16:13.843
l, uh...
l need a business manager.

16:13.884 --> 16:16.908
l could recommend
a few names for you.

16:16.951 --> 16:19.611
Actually, l was hoping you might
consider doing it yourself.

16:19.652 --> 16:22.175
Not like last time, okay.

16:22.219 --> 16:23.946
l mean, it's not a trust fund.

16:23.987 --> 16:26.545
l'll call the shots, you just
keep the money moving around

16:26.588 --> 16:28.884
where l can get the most
interest with the least risk.

16:28.922 --> 16:32.286
l know l was a jerk before.

16:32.323 --> 16:34.152
This time is different.

16:34.191 --> 16:36.282
Yeah.

16:36.324 --> 16:38.290
Well, you're different.

16:38.325 --> 16:41.053
You'll think about it?

16:42.094 --> 16:44.993
Sure.

16:47.529 --> 16:50.984
By the way, about Mexico,

16:51.030 --> 16:53.656
what exactly did you and
Valerie do down there?

16:53.697 --> 16:55.254
l'll spare you the details.

16:55.298 --> 16:56.764
Let's just say this,

16:56.799 --> 17:00.664
your little houseguest--
$10,000 richer.

17:15.605 --> 17:17.867
l'll take the whole outfit.

17:17.906 --> 17:21.237
And, um, l'd like
to wear it home.

17:21.275 --> 17:26.641
All right.
That'll be $965, plus tax.

17:26.675 --> 17:28.904
What will that be,
check or credit?

17:28.944 --> 17:30.739
Cash.

17:44.149 --> 17:47.173
Here, try these on.

17:48.217 --> 17:50.513
So, uh...

17:50.552 --> 17:53.280
if l get signed, would l make
an album right away?

17:53.319 --> 17:55.217
That's the way
record companies work.

17:55.253 --> 17:57.082
My own musicians,
my own material?

17:57.121 --> 18:00.281
Yes, whoever you want,
whatever you want.

18:03.123 --> 18:05.112
Those are nice.

18:07.090 --> 18:08.351
l don't know.

18:08.391 --> 18:10.084
l'm not sure
they're really my style.

18:10.125 --> 18:11.886
Oh, l think they are.

18:11.926 --> 18:13.619
But you know,
we can keep looking

18:13.660 --> 18:16.149
until we find exactly
what you like.

18:17.961 --> 18:20.621
Well, this is the last place
l'd expect to see you.

18:20.662 --> 18:22.060
-Valerie, hey.
-Hi.

18:22.096 --> 18:24.028
Yeah, this joint's
a little swanky for me.

18:24.063 --> 18:26.256
lt was, uh, Ariel's pick.

18:26.331 --> 18:28.797
Ariel.

18:28.832 --> 18:30.264
-Hi, l'm Valerie.
-Hi, Val.

18:30.365 --> 18:33.389
Well, Ray's going to have to
get used to stores like this.

18:33.433 --> 18:35.922
He's going to have a big career
at Firestorm Music.

18:35.968 --> 18:38.457
Firestorm? Never heard of it.

18:38.502 --> 18:39.934
lt's a great label.

18:39.969 --> 18:41.526
Ariel's an A&R rep there.

18:41.570 --> 18:44.435
Well, l'm going to look
around a little more.

18:47.338 --> 18:50.396
So, are you, like,
two-timing Donna?

18:50.439 --> 18:52.564
No, of course not.

18:52.607 --> 18:54.698
Ariel's just
a business associate.

18:54.741 --> 18:57.207
Seems pretty chummy
for a business associate.

18:57.242 --> 18:59.037
Whatever.

18:59.076 --> 19:00.440
l don't know, Ray.

19:00.477 --> 19:03.137
l think she's got an eye
for you.

19:03.177 --> 19:06.201
But, don't we all?

19:22.618 --> 19:25.107
These babies are worth
a paycheck and a half.

19:25.152 --> 19:28.210
Ariel didn't even
blink at the price.

19:28.286 --> 19:30.377
Well, they must provide well
at Firestorm.

19:30.421 --> 19:32.910
Yeah. l gotta admit,

19:32.955 --> 19:35.080
it would blow me away
to get signed by them.

19:35.122 --> 19:37.088
You know, there
are other labels,

19:37.123 --> 19:38.986
bigger than Firestorm.

19:39.023 --> 19:40.182
Well, l like it there.

19:40.225 --> 19:41.884
Ariel's taken a
real interest in me.

19:44.793 --> 19:50.421
Look, Ray, l never told you
why David and l broke up.

19:50.461 --> 19:53.985
But, basically, Ariel Hunter
was the cause.

19:54.029 --> 19:55.325
Ariel? How?

19:55.363 --> 19:57.852
She came on to him, the same way
she's coming on to you.

19:57.897 --> 19:59.193
Donna...

19:59.231 --> 20:03.221
she's just interested
in my music, that's all.

20:03.299 --> 20:06.095
Yeah, that's what
she said about David.

20:06.133 --> 20:07.531
And the next thing l knew

20:07.567 --> 20:10.033
they were holding ''meetings''
in the back of a limo.

20:10.068 --> 20:11.966
Well, that is not going
to happen with me.

20:12.002 --> 20:15.662
l don't want
to take any chances.

20:15.704 --> 20:19.467
Look, l want you
to return the boots.

20:19.505 --> 20:21.596
And l don't want you
to see Ariel again.

20:21.639 --> 20:23.935
No, you can't ask me to do that.

20:23.974 --> 20:25.201
Look, she buys gifts
for all her clients.

20:25.241 --> 20:26.639
lt's part of her job.

20:26.674 --> 20:29.004
l don't care. l don't want you
hanging around with her!

20:29.041 --> 20:31.007
Donna, this is the start
of something big for me!

20:31.042 --> 20:32.099
Don't you get that?

20:32.142 --> 20:33.506
So you can't do this for me?

20:33.543 --> 20:35.406
This isn't about you.
lt's about me.

20:35.444 --> 20:37.034
And right now,
that's my top priority.

20:50.716 --> 20:53.012
So, why didn't you tell me
about this?

20:56.085 --> 20:58.244
l don't know.

20:58.319 --> 21:01.252
l guess l figured you'd read it
in the paper like everyone else.

21:01.287 --> 21:03.082
Brandon, l am not everyone else.

21:03.120 --> 21:05.609
l'm your girlfriend.

21:05.655 --> 21:08.315
Could you say that
a little louder, please?

21:08.356 --> 21:11.845
Sorry. lt's just been
an intense time for me.

21:11.891 --> 21:13.357
l understand.

21:13.391 --> 21:15.357
Brandon, this means so much.

21:15.392 --> 21:16.858
l mean,
now maybe the Faculty Council

21:16.893 --> 21:18.189
will sit up and take notice.

21:18.260 --> 21:21.715
Well, l wouldn't count on it
working too much magic,

21:21.761 --> 21:23.784
but l am glad you're happy.

21:25.362 --> 21:27.555
With you, l am.

21:30.197 --> 21:32.390
Hey, what do you say we ditch
the rest of the day?

21:32.431 --> 21:33.897
We'll go to
the Santa Monica Mountains,

21:33.932 --> 21:35.761
have a little picnic,
watch the sunset.

21:35.799 --> 21:37.095
What do you say?

21:37.133 --> 21:38.190
l can't.

21:38.300 --> 21:39.789
l have research to do
for Finley.

21:39.834 --> 21:40.857
Blow it off.

21:40.901 --> 21:42.491
He needs me.

21:42.535 --> 21:44.524
l need you.

21:47.803 --> 21:51.031
Was that your motivation
for writing this editorial?

21:51.071 --> 21:53.094
No, it wasn't.

21:53.138 --> 21:55.400
But, like you say,
you are my girlfriend.

21:55.439 --> 21:57.496
lt would be nice to spend
a little time with you.

21:57.541 --> 21:59.030
ls there something
so wrong with that?

22:00.675 --> 22:03.471
No. l gotta go.

22:03.509 --> 22:05.907
Have a little courage.

22:13.079 --> 22:16.807
So, l, uh... l heard something
about you and Firestorm.

22:16.847 --> 22:19.678
Well, Ariel's, you know,
promising good things

22:19.714 --> 22:20.737
but nothing for sure yet.

22:20.782 --> 22:24.112
Listen, Ray, just so you know,

22:24.150 --> 22:26.275
Ariel might have
a few tricks up her sleeve.

22:26.317 --> 22:29.011
l mean, she may be into
more than just your music.

22:29.051 --> 22:31.711
Nothing l can't handle.

22:31.753 --> 22:35.584
l figured that's
what you would say.

22:35.620 --> 22:39.576
Hey, l didn't ask
for your advice, man.

22:39.622 --> 22:42.487
Look, Ray, you can go back
to pushing pumpkins

22:42.523 --> 22:44.148
for all l care, all right?

22:44.224 --> 22:45.951
l'm just looking out for Donna.

22:45.991 --> 22:49.685
Hey, no offense, David,
but Ariel didn't burn Donna

22:49.725 --> 22:51.520
all by herself last summer.

22:53.027 --> 22:55.755
l've got some songs
to run through.

23:07.265 --> 23:08.561
You're never going
to get through the Gothics

23:08.599 --> 23:09.792
at that pace.

23:09.832 --> 23:10.991
Yeah, l know.

23:11.034 --> 23:13.330
l'm just so distracted.

23:13.367 --> 23:14.799
What's wrong?

23:14.834 --> 23:17.528
l'm going crazy with
all this Ariel business.

23:17.569 --> 23:20.263
Egh. lf l had known
the backstory on her,

23:20.304 --> 23:22.236
l never would have
introduced her to Ray.

23:22.270 --> 23:24.202
Hey, it's not your fault.
At least you care.

23:24.238 --> 23:26.534
You know,
l tried to tell Kelly about it,

23:26.573 --> 23:28.471
and all l get
is her Finley psychobabble.

23:28.506 --> 23:30.631
''Don't play the victim.''

23:30.674 --> 23:32.333
''Move forward with your life.''

23:32.374 --> 23:34.897
''Commit to evolving.''

23:34.942 --> 23:37.841
Yeah, she has been speaking
a different language lately.

23:37.876 --> 23:39.535
But, if it's any help,

23:39.577 --> 23:41.975
my dad says Finley's days
at C.U. are numbered.

23:42.011 --> 23:44.807
Really? What about the appeal?

23:44.845 --> 23:46.004
l don't know.

23:46.046 --> 23:47.512
Apparently, he doesn't have much
support from his colleagues.

23:47.546 --> 23:51.809
Well, l hate to say it,
but l'm sort of glad.

23:51.847 --> 23:54.507
Well, don't flunk any exams
over it.

23:59.784 --> 24:03.478
Ray says he'll
be ten minutes.

24:03.519 --> 24:05.985
So, what were you guys doing out
there for so long?

24:06.019 --> 24:07.144
Just talking.

24:07.187 --> 24:08.653
About?

24:08.688 --> 24:12.348
Well, l tried
to tell him about Ariel.

24:12.388 --> 24:15.014
-You did?
-Yeah.

24:15.057 --> 24:16.387
l don't know
if l got through to him,

24:16.424 --> 24:19.357
but, uh, it was worth a shot.

24:19.391 --> 24:23.415
Thank you.

24:30.162 --> 24:33.993
Well, look what the
cat done drug in.

24:34.029 --> 24:35.325
Yeah. My new client.

24:35.364 --> 24:37.489
How was Mexico, bro?

24:37.531 --> 24:38.690
Mexican.

24:38.731 --> 24:41.027
He was just filling us in.

24:41.066 --> 24:42.555
Well, suffice it to say,

24:42.600 --> 24:44.566
we're lucky they both lived
to tell the tale.

24:44.601 --> 24:46.658
Come on. How bad
could it really have been?

24:46.701 --> 24:49.668
Oh, think guns,
seduction, dirty money.

24:49.702 --> 24:51.429
A real James Bond movie.

24:51.469 --> 24:52.730
Let's go back to that money.

24:52.769 --> 24:54.928
How much was there,
and how dirty was it?

24:54.971 --> 24:58.165
Well, Valerie walked off
with a cool $10,000.

24:58.205 --> 25:01.729
How come nothing like that
ever happens to me? Huh?

25:01.773 --> 25:04.740
She just looks better
in a dress than you do.

25:04.774 --> 25:05.740
You know what l mean?

25:05.774 --> 25:08.605
On that note, shall we dig in?

25:08.642 --> 25:12.735
Um... Dylan,
we don't mean to pry,

25:12.777 --> 25:16.904
but we know that you have spent
some time with Valerie.

25:16.945 --> 25:18.309
Yeah. Some.

25:21.914 --> 25:24.574
ln your opinion,
is there any reason

25:24.615 --> 25:26.547
that we should be concerned
about her?

25:26.582 --> 25:29.344
Let me tell you guys this.

25:29.383 --> 25:31.440
lf you thought you had
your hands full with Brenda,

25:31.484 --> 25:34.349
this girl
is a much bigger package

25:34.385 --> 25:36.180
with a much brighter bow.

25:40.954 --> 25:43.580
Jonesy...

25:43.622 --> 25:48.022
Listen. l figured,
since the craziness was over,

25:48.090 --> 25:51.579
we could get to know each other
under more...

25:51.625 --> 25:54.921
relaxing conditions.

25:54.959 --> 25:57.118
Good thinking.

25:57.159 --> 26:01.024
Although l did enjoy playing
charades with you down there.

26:01.095 --> 26:02.356
Well, l like charades myself.

26:02.395 --> 26:03.520
Well, let's play a game.

26:03.562 --> 26:06.427
Now?

26:06.463 --> 26:08.088
Yeah. Why not?

26:08.130 --> 26:09.619
Okay, ready?

26:09.664 --> 26:10.960
Okay.

26:11.999 --> 26:13.226
Movie.

26:13.265 --> 26:16.595
Three words.

26:16.634 --> 26:18.532
First word.

26:18.568 --> 26:20.659
Tired... sleep.

26:20.701 --> 26:21.962
Sleep.

26:22.035 --> 26:22.762
Okay.

26:22.802 --> 26:24.631
Second word.

26:26.337 --> 26:27.428
Small word?

26:27.471 --> 26:31.734
Uh... for... of... with?

26:33.239 --> 26:34.966
Sleep with...

26:37.941 --> 26:40.100
Jonesy, l am not going
to sleep with you.

26:40.142 --> 26:42.973
Well, why did you come here?

26:43.076 --> 26:46.440
Okay, l'll level with you.

26:46.478 --> 26:47.967
Please.

26:48.078 --> 26:50.772
l know you had a girl lined up
to help you in Mexico.

26:50.812 --> 26:53.370
And l know she was going to get
a cut for doing the job.

26:53.413 --> 26:55.709
And, since l took over the gig,

26:55.748 --> 26:57.839
l think l'm entitled
to that money.

26:57.881 --> 27:02.042
-Oh. -Now, Dylan didn't
see it my way,

27:02.083 --> 27:05.777
but you seem
to have a sense of honor.

27:05.817 --> 27:07.908
Honor?

27:08.019 --> 27:10.281
Are you sure you're talking
to the right Mr. Jones here?

27:10.319 --> 27:13.911
Jonesy, l did a good job,
didn't l?

27:14.021 --> 27:19.216
Darling, you came in like a pro,
and you went out like a pro.

27:19.256 --> 27:22.087
Now l just want
to get paid like a pro.

27:22.124 --> 27:23.613
Ah.

27:23.658 --> 27:25.556
Well, l'll tell you what.

27:25.592 --> 27:28.616
Um, l do happen to have

27:28.660 --> 27:31.922
a little cash on hand.

27:35.628 --> 27:38.026
Don't believe in banks, huh?

27:38.063 --> 27:39.926
Just offshore ones.

27:40.030 --> 27:42.053
Well, l like what l see.

27:42.097 --> 27:43.687
l'll bet you do.

27:43.731 --> 27:45.594
Now l will give you
what you came to get

27:45.632 --> 27:48.428
under one condition.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.557
Jonesy, l told you.

27:51.601 --> 27:53.124
l'm not going to sleep with you.

27:53.168 --> 27:56.067
No, no, no. Now, listen to me.

27:56.102 --> 27:58.500
That's not what l meant.

28:01.371 --> 28:03.030
Okay.

28:03.072 --> 28:05.197
What's the condition?

28:05.239 --> 28:10.537
That you work with me
sometime again.

28:13.142 --> 28:15.506
That's it?

28:18.244 --> 28:19.403
Okay.

28:19.444 --> 28:21.603
And...

28:21.645 --> 28:25.134
that you'll have
at least one drink with me.

28:29.481 --> 28:31.743
Okay.

28:42.186 --> 28:44.084
Are you crazy?
Terry Dixon wants

28:44.119 --> 28:45.778
to make you a star.

28:45.820 --> 28:47.547
Look, l just need to think
about it, all right?

28:47.587 --> 28:49.416
What is there to think about?

28:49.455 --> 28:51.785
He's offering you a signing
bonus and a two album deal.

28:51.822 --> 28:53.049
Yeah. And he also wants me

28:53.090 --> 28:54.488
to give up
all my publishing rights.

28:54.524 --> 28:56.581
lt's just for the first album.

28:56.624 --> 28:58.453
l explained this.
Don't go dumb on me.

28:58.491 --> 29:00.753
Look, l didn't just get off
the turnip truck, okay?

29:00.793 --> 29:02.816
l should at least get to keep
half of my publishing.

29:02.893 --> 29:05.416
A lot of new artists
get this deal, Ray.

29:05.461 --> 29:07.984
Yeah, but do they all write
and perform their own material?

29:08.028 --> 29:10.494
Oh! l don't believe this!

29:10.529 --> 29:13.927
No one's ever quibbled
about publishing before.

29:13.963 --> 29:15.088
Maybe they didn't know better.

29:15.130 --> 29:17.221
You make it sound like
we're trying to cheat you.

29:17.265 --> 29:19.288
Look, Ariel, if you think

29:19.332 --> 29:20.922
you can buy me off
with a new pair of boots

29:20.966 --> 29:23.524
and this second-rate
deal, keep thinking.

29:23.567 --> 29:24.828
l don't come that cheap.

29:24.901 --> 29:27.561
Ray, Terry
really wants this deal,

29:27.601 --> 29:29.965
and l'm willing
to go all the way here.

29:30.003 --> 29:31.628
Whatever it takes.

29:31.670 --> 29:35.034
Yeah, l've heard that about you.

29:36.238 --> 29:38.363
No deal.

29:48.209 --> 29:50.175
Remind me why
we're doing this.

29:50.210 --> 29:53.973
Because you got a babysitter,
your husband's out of town

29:54.012 --> 29:55.137
and so is my wife.

29:57.180 --> 29:58.805
lt sounds a little, uh...

29:58.846 --> 30:00.436
sounds a little dangerous to me.

30:00.480 --> 30:02.173
Well, l live on the edge.

30:02.214 --> 30:04.476
Well, l don't.

30:06.216 --> 30:08.842
Not usually, anyway.

30:08.917 --> 30:12.577
Well, you have to admit, it's
much more exciting than Boise.

30:14.452 --> 30:16.941
Come on, relax.

30:16.986 --> 30:18.849
Look, it's the middle
of the afternoon,

30:18.921 --> 30:20.182
we're in a public place.

30:20.221 --> 30:22.380
l mean...

30:22.421 --> 30:24.478
how dangerous can it get?

30:29.891 --> 30:31.221
Oh, l don't know.

30:31.258 --> 30:33.281
But my heart is beating
awfully fast, Dr. Tucker.

30:33.325 --> 30:34.382
Really?

30:36.460 --> 30:38.085
Wow, you're right.

30:38.127 --> 30:42.026
Should l call an ambulance,
or just take it as a compliment?

30:43.996 --> 30:46.519
Take it anyway you like.

31:06.904 --> 31:09.393
What can l say?

31:09.438 --> 31:11.267
l know the tide is
running against us.

31:11.306 --> 31:13.033
But it's just about fear.

31:13.073 --> 31:15.562
They don't understand the things
l'm trying to teach you,

31:15.607 --> 31:16.903
and that makes them crazy.

31:16.941 --> 31:19.965
But don't lose heart.

31:20.008 --> 31:22.236
l'm going into that meeting
tonight with my head held high,

31:22.276 --> 31:24.572
and l'm going to walk out
of there the same way,

31:30.546 --> 31:31.978
Brandon.

31:35.714 --> 31:37.805
Thanks for the editorial today.

31:37.915 --> 31:39.142
Well,
you're the students' choice.

31:39.182 --> 31:40.807
Tell that
to the Faculty Council.

31:40.916 --> 31:44.041
Yeah. Uh, is Kelly around?

31:44.084 --> 31:45.709
ln my office.

31:45.752 --> 31:47.547
-Do you mind?
-Go ahead.

31:58.790 --> 32:01.052
Who are the pretty flowers for?

32:01.090 --> 32:03.056
A pretty lady.

32:03.091 --> 32:04.455
Hmm.

32:04.492 --> 32:06.617
From a pretty nice guy.

32:06.659 --> 32:08.182
Good luck tonight.

32:09.594 --> 32:12.527
Thanks. We'll need it.

32:12.561 --> 32:17.052
Listen, um, if l've been
selfish lately, l'm sorry.

32:17.096 --> 32:18.494
lt's only because l love you.

32:18.530 --> 32:20.428
l know.

32:20.464 --> 32:21.760
Thank you.

32:28.234 --> 32:29.927
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:29.968 --> 32:31.729
Excuse me.
l'm looking for Ray Pruit.

32:31.769 --> 32:33.962
Do you know when l can
catch him rehearsing?

32:34.002 --> 32:35.865
Not really, but you can, uh,

32:35.903 --> 32:37.732
catch him having
a tuna melt right now.

32:40.037 --> 32:42.401
Oh. Thanks a lot.

32:50.208 --> 32:51.572
We need to talk.

32:51.609 --> 32:54.075
We don't have anything
to talk about.

32:54.109 --> 32:56.598
lf you don't mind, l'm trying
to have lunch with my boyfriend.

32:56.644 --> 32:58.701
Well, your boyfriend
made a very foolish,

32:58.744 --> 33:00.142
not to mention arrogant,
move today.

33:00.178 --> 33:04.703
My company offered him
a very fair deal.

33:04.746 --> 33:07.178
l'm going to go
get my stuff, all right?

33:11.582 --> 33:14.310
Donna, you have to talk to him.

33:14.350 --> 33:15.714
He's making
such a stupid mistake.

33:15.817 --> 33:17.283
Look, Ray isn't stupid, Ariel.

33:17.317 --> 33:18.715
And why should l help you,

33:18.818 --> 33:20.681
after you stabbed me
in the back this summer?

33:20.719 --> 33:23.879
Okay, l deserve that.

33:23.920 --> 33:27.717
Look, l'm really sorry about
what happened with David.

33:27.822 --> 33:29.651
But l'm a different person now.

33:29.688 --> 33:31.950
l'm sorry, too.

33:31.990 --> 33:33.615
But l have no reason
to believe you.

33:35.324 --> 33:36.517
Donna...

33:36.558 --> 33:38.717
you're not going
to lose Ray to me,

33:38.759 --> 33:41.590
but you just might lose him
to that ego of his.

33:53.164 --> 33:54.152
Hi.

33:54.198 --> 33:55.164
Hey.

33:55.198 --> 33:57.858
Ready to go?

33:57.899 --> 34:00.092
Thank you.

34:00.133 --> 34:01.792
For what?

34:01.834 --> 34:04.062
Not taking the deal.

34:04.101 --> 34:06.499
l gotta tell you, Donna,

34:06.536 --> 34:10.025
you were right about Ariel.

34:10.070 --> 34:12.161
ls that why you turned it down?

34:12.204 --> 34:16.331
No, actually, l turned it down
because it was a bad deal.

34:16.373 --> 34:19.897
Well, whatever the reason,

34:19.940 --> 34:21.963
l'm just glad you did it.

34:28.177 --> 34:29.802
Come on.

34:41.481 --> 34:43.447
Let me guess,

34:43.482 --> 34:46.347
you took the $10,000
and you leased a car?

34:46.382 --> 34:48.349
The money you gave me
was peanuts.

34:48.384 --> 34:50.475
-l own this car.
-How did you manage that?

34:50.518 --> 34:53.542
l found somebody a little bit
more honorable than you.

34:53.585 --> 34:56.949
What did you say to Jones?

34:56.987 --> 34:58.351
Not much.

34:58.388 --> 35:01.378
l just kind of smiled and his
wallet kind of flew open.

35:01.422 --> 35:03.388
Kind of like a hooker?

35:03.422 --> 35:05.354
l'm not a hooker.

35:05.390 --> 35:07.982
And even if l was...

35:09.825 --> 35:12.189
...you couldn't afford me.

35:25.131 --> 35:28.121
How long of a night do
you figure we're in for?

35:28.165 --> 35:30.723
l don't know, but l'm staying
till the vote comes down.

35:38.569 --> 35:40.558
What's the verdict?

35:40.603 --> 35:42.001
Hey...

35:42.037 --> 35:43.627
Hey, is Finley in or out?!

35:43.704 --> 35:45.465
-What's going on, guys?
-What's going on?

35:47.005 --> 35:48.471
Come on,
we have a right to know.

35:48.506 --> 35:50.131
This doesn't look good.

35:51.973 --> 35:54.838
-Here he comes.
-Shh.

35:54.875 --> 35:58.000
Look at you all,
out here for me still.

35:58.042 --> 36:00.770
My... my constant soldiers.

36:00.810 --> 36:04.174
Unfortunately this is one
battle that we did not win.

36:05.545 --> 36:07.034
Listen...

36:07.079 --> 36:09.307
you all fought the good fight,

36:09.346 --> 36:11.403
and l'm grateful to you.

36:11.447 --> 36:14.743
And just because we lost here,
doesn't mean this is over.

36:14.782 --> 36:16.509
l am a teacher.

36:16.549 --> 36:19.072
And if you all want
to be my students,

36:19.116 --> 36:21.514
then that's all that matters
at the end of the day.

36:21.550 --> 36:24.210
That's right, that's right.

36:26.586 --> 36:28.711
l may not be welcome
at this university,

36:28.753 --> 36:31.219
but l can give
my lectures under a tree,

36:31.254 --> 36:34.618
or from a park bench or in my
own living room if l have to.

36:39.991 --> 36:44.118
Be assured,
the New Evolution will go on.

36:44.159 --> 36:46.148
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

36:55.263 --> 36:57.923
Thank you. Thank you.

36:57.964 --> 37:00.430
l have to go to him.

37:00.465 --> 37:02.192
Go ahead.

37:05.967 --> 37:07.762
Kelly, you're here.

37:07.801 --> 37:09.699
Where else would l be?

37:09.735 --> 37:12.566
l need to get out of here.

37:14.803 --> 37:15.996
Thank you.

37:26.541 --> 37:28.336
How could this happen?

37:28.375 --> 37:30.933
lt's simple.
They don't like me.

37:30.976 --> 37:32.965
And the fact that l'm
popular with the students.

37:33.010 --> 37:35.476
That doesn't make any sense.

37:35.510 --> 37:37.533
They're threatened, Kelly.

37:37.578 --> 37:39.806
lt's nature of the beast.

37:39.845 --> 37:41.674
The unevolved beast.

37:43.547 --> 37:45.570
Yes.

37:47.182 --> 37:50.172
But what good is it
looking backwards?

37:50.216 --> 37:52.705
We're not going to implode just
because a bunch of ''externs''

37:52.750 --> 37:54.340
pulled a power trip on me.

37:55.351 --> 37:58.079
You're so inspiring.

37:58.119 --> 38:01.415
So are you.

38:01.453 --> 38:03.476
At least something good
came out of this.

38:03.587 --> 38:05.280
So, what do we do now?

38:05.321 --> 38:07.219
We go on.

38:07.256 --> 38:11.053
The most important thing is
that we stay together,

38:11.090 --> 38:13.454
close our circle to outsiders.

38:13.491 --> 38:14.821
Okay.

38:14.858 --> 38:16.483
How can l help?

38:16.525 --> 38:17.991
You've been indispensable
to me, Kelly,

38:18.026 --> 38:20.754
but now you face
a difficult test.

38:20.793 --> 38:24.658
A test to see how committed
you really are to this fight.

38:24.695 --> 38:27.628
You know l'm committed, 100%%.

38:29.596 --> 38:31.323
lt's about Brandon.

38:32.998 --> 38:35.021
What about Brandon?

38:39.000 --> 38:41.933
He doesn't share
your passion, Kelly.

38:41.968 --> 38:43.900
He's been projecting
negative energy

38:43.935 --> 38:45.662
about the New Evolution,
right from the start.

38:47.670 --> 38:50.501
Yeah, l guess he hasn't
exactly been won over.

38:50.571 --> 38:52.003
That's no good to you.

38:52.038 --> 38:54.937
lt's no good for any of us.

38:54.972 --> 38:58.996
l need you to do something
that will keep our family

38:59.041 --> 39:00.439
as tight-knit as it needs to be.

39:01.475 --> 39:04.067
l'll do anything.

39:04.109 --> 39:07.564
l need you to break it off
with Brandon.

39:10.112 --> 39:11.839
Would you do that for me?
