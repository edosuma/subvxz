WEBVTT

00:01.819 --> 00:02.726
Hey, guys!
Paige and Frankie here

00:02.761 --> 00:04.531
with a Bizaardvark Challenge,
featuring a special guest:

00:04.555 --> 00:05.770
My dad.

00:05.806 --> 00:07.464
Hello. (Laughing)

00:07.499 --> 00:09.198
I'm so excited,
I'm finally in a video.

00:09.234 --> 00:11.851
Yeah. He's been asking me
for two months.

00:11.887 --> 00:13.595
We are here to do
the Egghead Challenge.

00:13.630 --> 00:15.955
I have got a dozen eggs.

00:15.991 --> 00:17.285
Half of them are hard-boiled
and half of them are raw.

00:17.309 --> 00:21.077
Now Frankie and her dad are
gonna take turns choosing eggs

00:21.112 --> 00:23.330
and cracking them
on their heads.

00:23.365 --> 00:25.824
Hopefully, the ones that
they chose are hard-boiled.

00:25.860 --> 00:28.318
What? I-I thought you
guys made music videos.

00:28.395 --> 00:30.064
No, we're gonna... We'll put
music over this later.

00:30.088 --> 00:32.021
- Go! Your turn first.
- Go ahead.

00:32.057 --> 00:33.456
- No, please.
- No, no, go ahead.

00:33.492 --> 00:35.658
Okay, here we go. Okay,
here we go, and...

00:35.694 --> 00:38.537
(all scream)

00:38.572 --> 00:41.814
(distorted screaming)

00:41.850 --> 00:44.442
- It's all over your...
- You're up. Your turn!

00:44.477 --> 00:46.473
- Now, your turn.
- No, I don't have to go. You already lost, right?

00:46.497 --> 00:48.307
- It's your turn.
- No. No, no, no. You've got...

00:48.331 --> 00:49.890
- No cheating!
- Stop, I'm not!

00:49.925 --> 00:51.950
I can look at the egg!

00:51.986 --> 00:52.967
- That's cheating!
- It's cool time, let's go.

00:53.003 --> 00:55.637
- Ha!
- Oh!

00:55.672 --> 00:57.355
- Here we go.
- Okay.

00:57.391 --> 00:59.883
- Oh! (Laughing)
- Oh! Why? Why? Why?

00:59.919 --> 01:02.494
Why? It's like
it's on this side!

01:02.529 --> 01:04.487
- Okay, okay...
- You have such bad luck!

01:04.523 --> 01:06.003
- Just, come on.
- No, this is a yolk.

01:07.284 --> 01:10.393
- It didn't break.
- You have to hit it harder!

01:10.428 --> 01:13.947
- Oh! You are such a cheater!
- Oh! What...

01:13.982 --> 01:16.825
It didn't break on my head.
No! Paige!

01:16.860 --> 01:18.702
(screaming, laughing)

01:18.737 --> 01:21.429
- Woo!
- Oh! Finally!

01:21.465 --> 01:22.465
Yes! Hard-boiled.

01:24.376 --> 01:25.950
- Hard-boiled.
- How do you...

01:25.986 --> 01:27.038
It's like it cooks on her head.

01:27.062 --> 01:28.062
- (grumbles)
- (laughs)

01:29.365 --> 01:31.806
- Hey! Yes!
- Oh! Okay.

01:31.842 --> 01:33.450
- Come on, Frankie.
- This is the one!

01:33.485 --> 01:35.702
- Nope!
- Ohh!

01:35.738 --> 01:38.013
- I'm so good at this!
- How are you so lucky?

01:38.048 --> 01:39.142
- Here we go.
- Okay, round five.

01:39.166 --> 01:41.241
(all screaming)

01:41.277 --> 01:42.701
All right, come on.

01:42.736 --> 01:44.911
- (Paige screams)
- Yes! Yes!

01:44.946 --> 01:47.180
(distorted):
It's finally got her!

01:47.215 --> 01:49.875
So disgusting! How am
I gonna get this out?

01:49.910 --> 01:51.529
- No!
- We have one more for someone else here.

01:51.553 --> 01:53.628
- (screams)
- Yes! Yes!

01:53.664 --> 01:56.072
(distorted scream)

01:56.107 --> 01:58.491
- (screaming)
- Aww.

01:58.527 --> 02:00.135

02:52.831 --> 02:54.765
The beauty of "Romeo and Juliet"

02:54.800 --> 02:56.366
lies in the symbolism

02:56.401 --> 02:59.286
and the metaphors used to...

02:59.321 --> 03:00.321
Okay, who's bored?

03:03.867 --> 03:05.094
All right, let's make
Shakespeare more fun.

03:05.118 --> 03:06.501
Okay?

03:06.536 --> 03:08.119
I need two people up here

03:08.154 --> 03:09.763
to act out the death scene.

03:09.798 --> 03:11.531
Both: Ooh!

03:11.566 --> 03:12.566
Get up here, ladies.

03:16.079 --> 03:17.904
All right, here's your
fake poison

03:17.939 --> 03:19.289
and your fake poison.

03:19.324 --> 03:20.607
And... die!

03:21.910 --> 03:23.318
(gagging)

03:26.315 --> 03:27.405
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

03:30.585 --> 03:33.328
(theatrical wailing)

03:37.409 --> 03:38.892
Bravo, ladies!

03:38.927 --> 03:41.035
(school bell rings)

03:41.071 --> 03:42.090
All right, see you
tomorrow, everyone.

03:42.114 --> 03:45.198
Hey, you want to finish your
dad's video during lunch?

03:45.233 --> 03:47.159
It's so cool he asked us
to help him make one

03:47.194 --> 03:49.102
- for his online dating profile.
- Totally.

03:49.179 --> 03:50.565
I'm so happy he wants
to start dating again.

03:50.589 --> 03:53.765
You know, last night I walked
in on him dancing with a lamp.

03:57.121 --> 03:59.449
Frankie (narrating video): In a land
where loneliness reigns supreme,

03:59.473 --> 04:01.356
only one man can save love.

04:03.844 --> 04:06.620
Hi, ladies.
I'm Dr. Douglas Wong.

04:06.655 --> 04:08.571
Isn't it time to stop
dating a zero...

04:10.884 --> 04:13.410
(echoing screams)

04:13.445 --> 04:14.761
and get with

04:14.796 --> 04:18.031
Dr. Hero?

04:18.066 --> 04:19.991
Message me,
unless you can't handle

04:20.026 --> 04:21.876
being with a guy this fly.

04:23.379 --> 04:27.648
Dog lovers preferred!

04:27.684 --> 04:29.426
- Nailed it.
- Love is easy.

04:32.698 --> 04:34.189
(screams)

04:34.224 --> 04:36.916
This pain is unbearable!

04:36.951 --> 04:38.476
It's a nightmare
that will not end!

04:40.263 --> 04:41.454
Dirk?

04:41.489 --> 04:42.764
You okay?

04:42.799 --> 04:44.591
Yeah.

04:44.626 --> 04:45.986
Just having some
minor back issues.

04:48.313 --> 04:49.488
Do you want to talk about it?

04:49.523 --> 04:51.248
Nah.

04:51.283 --> 04:52.803
Nothing that can't wait
until tomorrow.

04:53.952 --> 04:55.072
All right, well, good night.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.880
(screams)

04:58.916 --> 05:00.815
End it now!

05:00.851 --> 05:02.834
My body's on fire!

05:04.204 --> 05:05.495
You know what?

05:05.530 --> 05:07.798
I'm up.

05:07.833 --> 05:09.474
What's going on?

05:09.509 --> 05:11.643
I think my back hurts

05:11.720 --> 05:14.203
from sleeping on your floor
the last few months.

05:14.238 --> 05:16.289
Well, what are we gonna do?

05:16.324 --> 05:18.444
We can't get a new floor,
and you can't get a new back.

05:18.468 --> 05:20.352
Those are clearly
the only two options.

05:21.846 --> 05:23.771
Hey!

05:23.807 --> 05:25.298
Since you live here now,

05:25.333 --> 05:26.502
why don't we just
get a bunk bed?

05:26.526 --> 05:29.744
Bern-Man, that's a great idea!

05:29.780 --> 05:32.180
I'll sleep peacefully tonight
knowing we solved that problem.

05:36.478 --> 05:38.336
Ahh! It's like a lightning storm

05:38.372 --> 05:40.855
in my body!

05:40.891 --> 05:42.290
(screams)

05:45.546 --> 05:47.699
Paige/Frankie (over video):
♪ Dr. Hero, he's a hero doctor ♪

05:47.723 --> 05:49.214
♪ He still has
most of his hair ♪

05:53.069 --> 05:55.253
- I don't know, uh...
- Dad.

05:55.289 --> 05:57.497
Every second your profile
doesn't have a video on it

05:57.532 --> 05:59.052
is one more second
no one's gonna contact you.

05:59.076 --> 06:00.324
(computer chimes)

06:00.360 --> 06:02.035
Someone just messaged you.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.661
First of all, burn.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.930
Second, what did she say?

06:05.965 --> 06:08.767
- "Hi."
- Ohh!

06:08.802 --> 06:10.694
Do I just write back "hi"?

06:10.729 --> 06:12.537
Both: No!

06:12.572 --> 06:14.764
You've got to be more real,
like, uh,

06:14.799 --> 06:16.991
"I'm a doctor.
I make honey money."

06:18.745 --> 06:20.545
No, that's not how you do it.

06:20.580 --> 06:22.038
You have to ask
a question about her.

06:22.073 --> 06:23.715
Okay, got it.

06:23.750 --> 06:24.874
"You ever seen a dead body?"

06:27.061 --> 06:28.269
Why would you send that?

06:28.305 --> 06:29.671
It's called small talk, Paige.

06:31.082 --> 06:33.441
I'll fix this.

06:33.477 --> 06:35.076
If you could be any animal,

06:35.111 --> 06:37.763
would you be a sea otter?

06:37.798 --> 06:40.159
- Again with the sea otters?
- Well, you never want to talk about them.

06:40.183 --> 06:42.358
Oh, she's writing back.

06:42.393 --> 06:44.227
"I'm more of a flamingo,

06:44.263 --> 06:46.537
and yes, one time
in a dumpster."

06:46.573 --> 06:49.699
Okay, red flag.
I do not like flamingos.

06:49.734 --> 06:52.143
Okay, this has been fun.

06:52.178 --> 06:53.653
Now, if you'll excuse me,

06:53.688 --> 06:55.997
I need to go...

06:56.032 --> 06:57.574
test this in the garage.

07:00.329 --> 07:02.587
(door closes)

07:02.623 --> 07:03.991
Ohh, I think your dad needs
to meet someone in person.

07:04.015 --> 07:06.316
Ohh, yeah.

07:06.351 --> 07:08.910
Ooh, what about
back-to-school night?

07:08.945 --> 07:10.515
There's gonna be single moms there,
plus, my dad's already going.

07:10.539 --> 07:12.005
That's perfect.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.673
(music playing)

07:15.802 --> 07:17.376
We're just gonna ignore
what's going on

07:17.412 --> 07:19.596
- in your garage, right?
- Yeah, 100 percent.

07:23.477 --> 07:26.436
Just picked up the latest
issue of Fun Bed magazine.

07:28.231 --> 07:30.215
I really should
renew my subscription.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.250
Now, more than ever, it's
important to be informed.

07:33.428 --> 07:35.803
Remember, we're looking
for something cool,

07:35.839 --> 07:37.330
but also practical.

07:37.365 --> 07:38.781
Obviously. We're two grown men.

07:40.410 --> 07:43.603
Whoa, a hamburger bed!

07:43.638 --> 07:45.398
I can wear my red pajamas
and be the ketchup.

07:46.174 --> 07:47.481
(gasping)

07:47.517 --> 07:49.167
Oh, my.

07:49.202 --> 07:51.152
She's glorious!

07:51.188 --> 07:52.629
Both: Yacht Bed!

07:54.966 --> 07:56.691
Bernie: Two mattress decks,

07:56.726 --> 07:58.176
a video game center,

07:58.211 --> 08:00.236
satellite TV.

08:00.272 --> 08:02.271
Surround sound speaker system.

08:02.307 --> 08:03.656
A mini fridge.

08:03.691 --> 08:04.774
(Dirk gasps)

08:04.810 --> 08:06.059
A giant horn!

08:07.846 --> 08:09.104
She's the one.

08:09.139 --> 08:10.713
Pricey, but...

08:10.749 --> 08:11.749
you pay for luxury.

08:14.403 --> 08:15.788
We're gonna have to tap into
some of your DareMeBro money.

08:15.812 --> 08:17.504
Uh...

08:17.539 --> 08:19.797
what DareMeBro money?

08:19.833 --> 08:21.441
Your channel has millions
of viewers.

08:21.476 --> 08:23.175
You must bring in tons of cash.

08:23.211 --> 08:25.678
I do, but I spend it all
on my videos.

08:25.714 --> 08:27.855
I mean, my cannon budget alone

08:27.891 --> 08:29.324
is a hundred grand.

08:29.359 --> 08:31.667
And then there's
that guy in Indiana

08:31.702 --> 08:34.353
who dares me to send him
500 bucks a week!

08:34.389 --> 08:35.829
Yeah, yeah.
I get how business works.

08:38.334 --> 08:40.835
Look, if we're gonna buy
this yacht bed,

08:40.871 --> 08:42.298
we're gonna have to find
another way to get the money.

08:42.322 --> 08:44.414
I got it!

08:44.449 --> 08:46.329
We'll check the couch
cushions for spare change!

08:50.780 --> 08:53.064
(yawning)

08:54.851 --> 08:55.851
He's my hero.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.986
Frankie, I appreciate it, but I
don't think back-to-school night

09:04.010 --> 09:05.313
is a place for me
to meet someone.

09:05.337 --> 09:06.502
Oh, totally, Dad. I get it.

09:06.538 --> 09:08.846
Wow, Dr. Wong!

09:08.882 --> 09:11.007
Tell me more about how you like

09:11.084 --> 09:13.585
to take women you just met
on luxurious vacations.

09:16.914 --> 09:18.554
Frankie! I need to talk to you.
Excuse me.

09:20.610 --> 09:22.602
I don't really
need to talk to you,

09:22.637 --> 09:24.131
I just can't keep lying
to Connor's mom

09:24.155 --> 09:25.071
that her kid has a future.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.815
(laughing)

09:26.850 --> 09:28.991
Oh, Dad, this is my teacher, Ms.
Bates.

09:29.027 --> 09:31.394
Uh, spoiler alert,
I'm a mediocre student

09:31.430 --> 09:32.624
and there is room
for improvement.

09:32.648 --> 09:33.980
Have at it.

09:36.376 --> 09:38.192
Hey! Okay.

09:38.228 --> 09:40.245
I've been scouting all the moms,

09:40.322 --> 09:42.362
and I'm leaning towards
Sky's mom, the hair stylist.

09:44.592 --> 09:47.452
This doesn't just happen,
you know.

09:47.487 --> 09:48.815
You know what,
I like the way you think.

09:48.839 --> 09:50.396
Just because we're
setting up my dad,

09:50.431 --> 09:51.784
doesn't mean we can't
get something out of it.

09:51.808 --> 09:53.166
Who else is there?

09:53.201 --> 09:54.775
Hmm.

09:54.810 --> 09:56.869
Oh, what about Tara's mom?

09:56.905 --> 09:59.105
I hear she's a lot mellower
since she got out of prison.

10:00.617 --> 10:02.697
You know what, I just heard
myself say it. Forget it.

10:04.595 --> 10:05.595
Ooh. What about Heather?

10:07.174 --> 10:08.350
Doesn't her mom smell like soup?

10:08.374 --> 10:10.532
Heather has a car.

10:10.568 --> 10:11.728
Don't we all smell like soup?

10:14.172 --> 10:16.605
Oh, Dad, I have someone
I want you to meet.

10:16.641 --> 10:17.921
How do you feel
about minestrone?

10:19.386 --> 10:21.001
Actually, I already met someone.

10:21.037 --> 10:23.212
Ms. Bates and I
totally hit it off.

10:23.248 --> 10:25.415
We're thinking about
grabbing coffee.

10:25.450 --> 10:27.808
- Oh.
- If that's okay with you.

10:27.843 --> 10:29.669
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.
- Great.

10:29.704 --> 10:32.247
I'll go tell her it's a date.

10:32.282 --> 10:34.962
You were right, Frankie. This was
the perfect place to meet someone.

10:37.420 --> 10:38.670
What the heck just happened?

10:40.615 --> 10:42.255
My dad's going on a date
with our teacher?

10:46.480 --> 10:47.498
- Hey, guys! I'm Paige.
- I'm Frankie.

10:47.522 --> 10:49.272
Both: And we're Bizaardvark.

10:49.307 --> 10:50.393
We're here with Dirk and Bernie

10:50.417 --> 10:51.685
to do the "Don't Laugh"
Challenge.

10:51.709 --> 10:53.743
(laughs)

10:53.779 --> 10:55.256
(buzzer sounds) - Oh, no,
this is gonna be hard.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.105
Do you like my hair?

10:57.140 --> 10:59.224
(Frankie laughs)

10:59.259 --> 11:01.317
This act is dead.
This act is dead.

11:01.352 --> 11:02.152
(buzzer sounds)

11:02.187 --> 11:05.138
(blows whistle)

11:05.173 --> 11:07.240
Get it? 'Cause I'm small
and the whistle's big.

11:07.275 --> 11:08.516
(buzzer sounds)

11:08.551 --> 11:09.817
(Southern accent) Hi...

11:09.852 --> 11:12.286
My name's Fred.

11:12.322 --> 11:14.406
You like me? (Laughs)

11:14.441 --> 11:15.760
- I don't like you, Fred.
- She won.

11:15.784 --> 11:16.690
(buzzer sounds)

11:16.726 --> 11:18.042
(laughs)

11:19.712 --> 11:22.130
- (laughs)
- You lost. You lost.

11:26.544 --> 11:28.419
How you doing?

11:28.454 --> 11:31.105
- (laughs)
- Dirk: Yes!

11:31.141 --> 11:32.141
(pops lips)

11:34.085 --> 11:35.085
- (pops lips)
- (laughs)

11:38.164 --> 11:39.230
Paige: Oh!

11:39.265 --> 11:41.274
(buzzer sounds)

11:41.309 --> 11:42.233
- Bernie: I think you lost.
- Dirk: Did I?

11:42.268 --> 11:43.776
I did not laugh.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.640
- They went out again last night?
- It's been three dates!

11:54.664 --> 11:56.589
She's been to my house.

11:56.624 --> 11:58.850
She has a first name.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.668
It's Dana!

12:02.405 --> 12:04.756
Are we even allowed
to know that?

12:04.791 --> 12:06.652
I just don't want anyone else
to know about them.

12:06.676 --> 12:08.275
I just want my school
to be my school

12:08.311 --> 12:09.577
and my home to be my home.

12:09.612 --> 12:11.212
It's starting to mess
with my head.

12:11.247 --> 12:12.655
All right, class,

12:12.691 --> 12:15.558
instead of studying
The Scarlett Letter,

12:15.594 --> 12:18.211
I've written a book of my own

12:18.246 --> 12:22.207
called A Romantic Evening
With Frankie's Dad.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.666
Twenty-six chapters,

12:23.701 --> 12:26.085
excruciating detail.

12:26.120 --> 12:28.196
(screams)

12:31.192 --> 12:32.725
Um...

12:32.761 --> 12:34.677
Don't mind Frankie.

12:34.713 --> 12:36.679
She just got this weird cough
that's going around.

12:36.714 --> 12:37.831
(screams)

12:37.866 --> 12:40.208
(hacking cough)

12:40.243 --> 12:41.243
So.

12:43.829 --> 12:45.546
Okay, time for a quick
writing assignment.

12:47.709 --> 12:50.210
Write about other romantic dates

12:50.245 --> 12:53.054
Frankie's dad and I could go on,

12:53.089 --> 12:56.232
and please incorporate
the following words or phrases.

12:56.268 --> 12:57.742
"Snuggles."

12:57.777 --> 12:59.986
"Kissing."

13:00.021 --> 13:03.239
"Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah,"

13:03.275 --> 13:04.807
mwah, mwah...

13:04.842 --> 13:06.901
No. No more "mwah, mwah"!

13:11.015 --> 13:12.707
Uh...

13:12.742 --> 13:14.700
Yes, Frankie, No More Mwah Mwah.

13:14.736 --> 13:17.003
That is actually
the original title

13:17.038 --> 13:18.696
of The Scarlett Letter.

13:18.731 --> 13:19.831
Yeah, that's what I meant.

13:22.844 --> 13:25.277
Moving on.

13:25.313 --> 13:27.793
Can anyone tell me what letter
Hester Prynne wore on her dress?

13:29.283 --> 13:30.592
An "A."

13:30.627 --> 13:31.627
That's correct.

13:33.471 --> 13:35.438
And "A" is also the key

13:35.473 --> 13:37.807
we'll be singing in...

13:37.842 --> 13:40.193
(music plays)

13:40.228 --> 13:42.128
♪ School and home,
school and home ♪

13:42.163 --> 13:43.979
♪ Everywhere
Ms. Bates will roam ♪

13:44.015 --> 13:46.065
♪ Tests in bed, dad at school ♪

13:46.101 --> 13:48.208
♪ It's the end of being cool ♪

13:48.244 --> 13:50.286
No, no! Stop singing!
Stop singing!

13:50.322 --> 13:51.838
Stop singing!

13:51.873 --> 13:52.873
Stop si...

13:55.693 --> 13:57.894
Uh...

13:57.929 --> 13:59.565
Nope, sorry. I can't go
with you on that one.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.289
(school bell rings)

14:05.236 --> 14:07.570
Frankie?

14:07.605 --> 14:09.922
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm... I'm good.

14:11.283 --> 14:13.417
Well...

14:13.453 --> 14:15.978
if you ever want to chat,
we can talk here

14:16.013 --> 14:18.539
or we can talk at your house.

14:18.575 --> 14:20.016
I'm always around.

14:27.858 --> 14:30.568
So, Mr. Schotz and Mr. MeBro,

14:33.248 --> 14:34.549
you're looking to borrow
money from our bank

14:34.573 --> 14:36.306
so you can buy a yacht?

14:36.342 --> 14:37.342
Correct.

14:38.770 --> 14:41.404
We currently have a small ship.

14:41.439 --> 14:44.106
But if we don't
make this upgrade,

14:44.141 --> 14:45.901
I don't think I'll be able
to sleep at night.

14:47.553 --> 14:49.645
Great. So, how often do you
plan on using this yacht?

14:49.681 --> 14:51.655
Oh, at least eight hours a day.

14:51.691 --> 14:53.674
Plus, weekend naps,

14:53.709 --> 14:55.743
and obviously the
occasional pretend time

14:55.778 --> 14:57.887
with pirate attacks,
mermaids, and what have you.

14:59.791 --> 15:03.617
I see. And what interest rate
were you thinking about?

15:03.653 --> 15:07.063
Oh. Our interest rate...
is very high.

15:08.733 --> 15:11.776
I need to stop sleeping on the
floor as soon as possible.

15:14.146 --> 15:16.016
Gentlemen, do you happen
to have a picture of this

15:16.040 --> 15:16.981
yacht that you're
hoping to purchase?

15:17.016 --> 15:18.115
Yeah.

15:23.898 --> 15:26.641
Oh, I see what's going on.

15:26.676 --> 15:28.000
You two are idiots.

15:30.171 --> 15:31.671
You saw the giant horn, right?

15:33.333 --> 15:35.274
We're done here.

15:35.310 --> 15:37.476
And, uh, just out
of morbid curiosity,

15:37.511 --> 15:38.844
what's in the briefcase?

15:46.128 --> 15:47.603
We're making tacos later.

15:54.596 --> 15:56.090
Five dates, Paige.
They've been on five dates.

15:56.114 --> 15:58.647
- I know this is awkward for you.
- Everyone knows.

15:58.682 --> 15:59.907
The entire school.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.386
I mean, look at them.

16:04.422 --> 16:05.582
They're all making fun of me.

16:08.325 --> 16:10.676
I really think
this is all in your head.

16:10.711 --> 16:12.686
I mean, how would
anybody even know

16:12.722 --> 16:14.346
that your dad and Ms.
Bates are together?

16:14.381 --> 16:16.966
(wedding march plays)

16:19.286 --> 16:20.928
And now,

16:20.964 --> 16:22.771
in front of all
the popular kids,

16:22.806 --> 16:25.091
who determine who's cool

16:25.126 --> 16:26.206
and who gets made fun of...

16:28.246 --> 16:29.845
I now pronounce you,

16:29.880 --> 16:31.814
teacher and dad.

16:33.610 --> 16:35.134
You may now

16:35.170 --> 16:36.361
laugh at Frankie.

16:36.396 --> 16:39.196
(all laughing)

16:41.576 --> 16:42.849
No! I object!

16:42.885 --> 16:44.410
I object!

16:47.465 --> 16:49.115
That's it.

16:49.150 --> 16:50.291
I can't take this anymore.

16:51.777 --> 16:54.687
(sighs)

16:54.722 --> 16:56.241
- Frankie, what are you doing?
- I need to break them up.

16:56.265 --> 16:57.932
What? How?

16:57.967 --> 17:00.468
I'm gonna snoop around her desk

17:00.503 --> 17:01.696
until I find something that will make
my dad want to end things with her.

17:01.720 --> 17:04.305
Frankie, this is crazy.

17:04.340 --> 17:05.247
We can't just look through
a teacher's...

17:05.283 --> 17:07.191
C minus!

17:07.226 --> 17:08.901
I worked hard on this!

17:08.936 --> 17:10.561
What kind of monster is she?

17:12.481 --> 17:13.914
Ms. Bates: I'll be right there.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.085
I just left something
in my classroom.

17:15.109 --> 17:16.517
(gasps) Ms. Bates!

17:16.552 --> 17:17.693
Hide!

17:19.030 --> 17:20.571
Hide better!

17:22.458 --> 17:23.458
(cell phone ringing)

17:27.280 --> 17:28.721
Hi, there, Max.

17:28.756 --> 17:30.122
(mouthing)

17:32.151 --> 17:33.378
I can't wait for our
date tonight, either.

17:33.402 --> 17:35.594
Just the two of us
at Lombardo's.

17:35.629 --> 17:37.079
I love you too, baby.

17:37.114 --> 17:38.214
(kisses)

17:43.579 --> 17:44.887
She's cheating on your dad!

17:44.922 --> 17:46.622
No.

17:46.658 --> 17:48.991
She's cheating...

17:49.026 --> 17:50.309
on my dad.

17:52.988 --> 17:55.588
Okay, I feel like we said the same
words, but you said them wrong.

17:56.426 --> 17:58.592
This is exactly what I need
to break them up.

17:58.627 --> 17:59.302
We'll just... We'll go
to Lombardo's tonight,

17:59.337 --> 18:02.438
film Ms. Bates with this Max
guy and show it to my dad.

18:02.473 --> 18:03.856
Yeah!

18:03.891 --> 18:05.792
I can't wait to go in there

18:05.868 --> 18:08.719
and give that two-timing cheat
a piece of my mind!

18:08.754 --> 18:10.994
- You're just gonna do the filming.
- Oh, thank goodness.

18:16.370 --> 18:17.431
All right, we just need
to find Ms. Bates,

18:17.455 --> 18:20.848
film her with this Max guy and
prove to my dad she's a liar.

18:20.883 --> 18:22.299
(gasps) There she is.

18:25.563 --> 18:27.483
I don't know why I gasped.
We knew she'd be here.

18:30.934 --> 18:31.934
And that must be Max.

18:33.971 --> 18:35.237
Hey, what a small world.

18:35.273 --> 18:37.748
Oh-h-h-h-h!

18:37.783 --> 18:40.275
Drop the act, Dana!

18:40.310 --> 18:41.990
Yeah, that's right.
I know your first name.

18:43.314 --> 18:46.357
I know it, too!

18:46.392 --> 18:49.560
But I'm still gonna call you Ms. Bates
because that's more appropriate.

18:49.595 --> 18:51.548
We know you're cheating on my
dad, and now we have proof!

18:51.572 --> 18:54.498
- What?
- Cheating teacher. Is there anything sicker?

18:54.533 --> 18:56.400
Yeah, and you can tell
that slimeball Max,

18:56.435 --> 18:57.595
I don't like his stupid face.

18:59.355 --> 19:00.755
Why doesn't she like
my face, Mommy?

19:02.708 --> 19:05.151
Frankie, Paige,

19:05.186 --> 19:06.760
this is my son, Max.

19:10.508 --> 19:11.891
- Hello.
- A pleasure.

19:14.762 --> 19:16.437
This is Max's
favorite restaurant.

19:16.472 --> 19:18.865
So, wait. Who...

19:18.941 --> 19:20.669
Who was the guy in the suit
who kissed your cheek?

19:20.693 --> 19:22.826
The owner, and an old friend.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.570
Ohh.

19:26.449 --> 19:28.240
Well, I'm so glad
this is all in my head.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.246
No? Okay. Run. Run!

19:36.584 --> 19:39.118
Bernie: Welcome to The
DareMeBro Workout video.

19:39.153 --> 19:41.379

Me Bro" Mann.

19:47.228 --> 19:48.385
(neighs)
- Horse Face Guy.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.222
Disco Chef!

19:52.926 --> 19:55.017
Girl from
the Bad Timing Channel.

20:00.507 --> 20:02.090
And me, Bern...

20:02.125 --> 20:05.169
Our first DareMeBro exercise

20:05.205 --> 20:07.788
is great for your back and core.
It's called...

20:07.823 --> 20:09.281
"Cannonball Avoiding."

20:11.260 --> 20:13.210
Pay careful attention
to my form.

20:13.246 --> 20:16.055
(loud boom)

20:16.090 --> 20:17.331
(clattering)

20:19.268 --> 20:20.667
And you're gonna want to do

20:20.703 --> 20:21.836
about 50 of those a day!

20:21.871 --> 20:26.832
(cannon fire)

20:26.868 --> 20:31.245
I can't believe this video
hasn't made us any money yet.

20:31.280 --> 20:33.422
Is it possible that
not as many people

20:33.457 --> 20:35.482
have access to cannons
as we thought?

20:35.517 --> 20:37.268
Nah, dude. People have cannons!

20:39.805 --> 20:41.492
I don't understand. Who
wouldn't want to buy this?

20:41.516 --> 20:44.132
It's a great value at $19.99...

20:44.167 --> 20:46.535
(under his breath) ...99.

20:46.570 --> 20:48.704
This is so frustrating.

20:48.739 --> 20:51.131
We need that yacht bed.

20:51.167 --> 20:53.150
Why is finding money so hard?

20:53.185 --> 20:54.535
(grunts)

21:00.034 --> 21:02.134
Your walls are filled
with money?

21:02.169 --> 21:04.519
Yeah. It gets chilly in here

21:04.555 --> 21:05.955
and money makes
the best insulation.

21:08.576 --> 21:10.426
All of our problems are solved!

21:13.881 --> 21:16.390
Oww!

21:21.998 --> 21:23.731
Hi, Dad.

21:23.766 --> 21:25.524
Hi, Dr. Wong.

21:27.453 --> 21:30.062
Hi, Douglas.

21:30.097 --> 21:31.377
I took bread
from the restaurant.

21:33.943 --> 21:36.060
Dana, we should probably talk.

21:36.095 --> 21:37.415
Frankie, I'll deal
with you later.

21:40.249 --> 21:42.708
Girls, would you mind keeping
an eye on Max for a moment?

21:42.743 --> 21:44.785
- No problem.
- I'm not great with kids, but you...

21:44.820 --> 21:45.820
Okay.

21:51.611 --> 21:55.036
So, Max...

21:55.072 --> 21:56.422
you like dinosaurs?

21:56.457 --> 21:58.407
Yeah. I like the blue ones,

21:58.442 --> 22:00.401
the ones with scales,

22:00.436 --> 22:03.095
and there's this one
in a movie that flies.

22:03.130 --> 22:04.772
Look what you've started.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.451
My mom gave me this robot

22:09.486 --> 22:10.778
and it's not even my birthday.

22:12.523 --> 22:14.698
She's been pretty happy lately.

22:14.734 --> 22:16.116
Maybe it's...
because of your dad.

22:20.698 --> 22:23.123
You're right.

22:23.158 --> 22:25.078
I guess my dad has been
pretty happy lately, too.

22:27.221 --> 22:28.871
Dad, can I talk to you
for a second?

22:28.906 --> 22:31.006
Come on, Max,
we should probably go.

22:31.042 --> 22:32.152
No, I want you
to hear this, too.

22:32.176 --> 22:34.043
And Paige, you can also stay.

22:34.078 --> 22:35.511
Never planned on leaving.

22:37.365 --> 22:39.081
Dad, I messed up.

22:39.116 --> 22:42.376
It's just, you dating Ms.
Bates has been hard for me,

22:42.411 --> 22:45.212
but, I mean, seeing
you two just now,

22:45.247 --> 22:46.897
I realize
I've only been thinking

22:46.933 --> 22:48.632
about how this is affecting me,

22:48.667 --> 22:51.318
not how happy
this is making you.

22:52.913 --> 22:54.813
I'm sorry.

22:54.848 --> 22:56.190
To you, too, Ms. Bates.

22:56.225 --> 22:58.041
Thanks, Frankie.

22:58.077 --> 23:00.861
Thanks, kiddo.

23:00.897 --> 23:02.682
And I'm sorry I haven't been
checking in with you more.

23:02.706 --> 23:05.299
This is new to me, too.

23:05.334 --> 23:06.625
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

23:13.483 --> 23:15.225
Sorry we couldn't
afford the bed.

23:15.261 --> 23:16.877
Aw.

23:16.912 --> 23:19.488
Come on, Bern-Man.

23:19.524 --> 23:21.234
You couldn't have known
that you were gonna break

23:21.258 --> 23:23.225
all 27 bones in your hand.

23:26.947 --> 23:29.667
Or that the doctor would charge you
extra because he didn't like you.

23:32.086 --> 23:33.688
Well, what are we
gonna do about your back?

23:33.712 --> 23:35.371
You still have to sleep
on the ground.

23:35.406 --> 23:38.298
Luckily, we still had
enough money left

23:38.334 --> 23:39.894
to buy these noise-canceling
headphones.

23:43.405 --> 23:45.164
- Good night, Bern-Man!
- Good night, Dirk!

23:51.013 --> 23:53.338
(screams)

23:53.374 --> 23:55.632
It's like I'm sleeping
on razors!

23:57.044 --> 23:59.486
Bernie! Help me!

23:59.521 --> 24:02.981
(screaming)
