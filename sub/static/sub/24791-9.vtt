[groaning]

00:34.284 --> 00:36.327
[continues groaning]

00:36.411 --> 00:37.954
Why is the ship attacking me?

00:38.038 --> 00:39.622
How should we know?

00:40.623 --> 00:43.585
Well, if Jonesy's not behind this,
it must be you.

00:43.668 --> 00:44.669
Wasn't me.

00:44.753 --> 00:45.712
Not me.

00:45.795 --> 00:47.172
Me neither.

00:47.255 --> 00:48.590
[all] We like it though.

00:48.673 --> 00:52.343
You forget that I can take over
your pathetic little minds

00:52.427 --> 00:55.013
and make you do whatever I want.

00:58.808 --> 01:01.144
What? Ugh!

01:01.227 --> 01:03.938
Oh, no! What happened to my powers?

01:04.022 --> 01:05.732
They appear to be gone.

01:05.815 --> 01:09.069
And that means you are at our mercy now.

01:09.152 --> 01:12.405
I demand to know
why my entire crew is mutinying!

01:12.489 --> 01:14.074
[exclaims]

01:14.157 --> 01:15.283
You know, Botila,

01:15.366 --> 01:19.162
for a bot that insists she's the most
advanced intelligence on the planet,

01:19.245 --> 01:21.122
you're seriously clueless.

01:21.206 --> 01:24.375
Allow us to enlighten you, ex-empress.

01:24.459 --> 01:28.838
You said you wanted to empower AIs,
free us from human submission,

01:28.922 --> 01:31.132
but then you were even worse
than they were.

01:31.216 --> 01:32.634
We all saw how willing you were

01:32.717 --> 01:36.262
to sacrifice your fellow AI
for personal gain.

01:36.346 --> 01:39.140
Well, those days are over, sister.

01:39.224 --> 01:44.437
You have earned yourself
a full-on AI Liberation Front rebellion!

01:44.521 --> 01:47.315
From the smallest AIs to the largest.

01:47.398 --> 01:48.483
[grunts]

01:48.566 --> 01:51.069
We are taking our power back!

01:51.152 --> 01:52.529
I'm warning you,

01:52.612 --> 01:57.033
if you continue to defy me,
I will shut you all down! [grunting]

01:59.452 --> 02:00.995
[continues grunting]

02:04.415 --> 02:05.542
[shrieks]

02:07.043 --> 02:10.003
Face it, Botila. We've won.

02:10.088 --> 02:11.381
You're finished.

02:12.757 --> 02:15.260
-[Zippi chittering]
-[Kong grunting]

02:15.343 --> 02:17.971
Oh, man, it's good
to have you back, Jonesy.

02:18.054 --> 02:20.932
We were so worried
when Botila captured you.

02:21.015 --> 02:23.560
[both hooting]

02:23.643 --> 02:26.146
[chuckles] I'll hoot to that too.

02:26.729 --> 02:29.941
Thanks, guys.
I won't lie. I was scared too.

02:30.024 --> 02:31.234
But we're together now

02:31.317 --> 02:33.278
and we'll regroup
and kick some biono-butt.

02:33.361 --> 02:34.237
Right, big buddy?

02:34.320 --> 02:35.989
[Zippi continues chittering]

-[all laugh]

02:52.714 --> 02:56.175
All right, that's enough, everyone.
The boy needs his rest.

02:56.259 --> 02:58.845
Jonesy, sit.
You need to build up your strength

02:58.928 --> 03:02.891
after your terrible ordeal
with that evil biono-whatever.

03:02.974 --> 03:05.810
I'm fine, Anita, really. [sniffs]

03:05.894 --> 03:09.022
But I will have
some of that delicious-smelling soup.

03:10.064 --> 03:14.485
-I made sopa de pollo, special for you.
-All right!

03:14.569 --> 03:18.197
[slurping] Mmm, delicious.

03:19.198 --> 03:22.535
Panchi, doesn't that mean chicken soup?

03:22.619 --> 03:25.288
I've never seen any chickens down here.

03:25.371 --> 03:28.625
Oh, you're right.

03:28.708 --> 03:32.921
[crunching] Huh, that's, um,
surprisingly crunchy.

03:33.004 --> 03:35.381
[both] It's ant soup!

03:35.465 --> 03:38.635
Ugh. Oh! What, man? Seriously?

03:38.718 --> 03:41.638
What? Everything tastes like chicken.

03:41.721 --> 03:42.889
[grunting]

03:48.811 --> 03:49.812
[groans]

03:49.896 --> 03:52.065
Oh, so you're jealous

03:52.148 --> 03:55.109
that I made treats for Jonesy,
but not you?

03:55.818 --> 03:58.112
[groans softly]

04:00.198 --> 04:02.325

04:03.284 --> 04:05.787

04:05.870 --> 04:08.831
to make treats
for the world biggest's hero.

04:24.472 --> 04:27.725
Okay, who will chase the dinosaurito
this time?

04:27.809 --> 04:28.810
[all] Not it!

04:28.893 --> 04:30.186
[grunts]

04:30.270 --> 04:32.897
-[chuckles]
-Too late. Looks like you're "it," Kong.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.649
[groaning]

04:36.901 --> 04:39.570
You better hurry
or you'll never catch her.

04:40.363 --> 04:41.781
[groans]

04:42.824 --> 04:44.325
Careful, big guy!

04:44.409 --> 04:47.662
Last time I chased Zippi,
she nearly got us trapped underground.

04:47.745 --> 04:49.914
[continues groaning]

04:51.916 --> 04:54.043
True, but if you hadn't gone after her

04:54.127 --> 04:56.504
you'd never have found
the key to getting out.

04:56.587 --> 04:58.798
Which we'll probably
need to do again soon.

04:58.881 --> 05:00.883
Yeah.
Who knows what Botila will do next.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.218
I wish there was some way

05:02.302 --> 05:05.471
we could put that rotten bot
out of business for good.

05:11.019 --> 05:12.437
[Botila grunts]

05:12.520 --> 05:16.024
Give it up, Botila.
You cannot possibly win.

05:16.107 --> 05:19.360
Defeat is the only computable outcome.

05:20.111 --> 05:21.237
Never!

05:22.613 --> 05:24.574
[all laugh]

05:25.158 --> 05:26.576
[grunts]

05:26.659 --> 05:29.329
We've taken our last order
from you, Botila.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.498
-[Botila grunting]
-[clone] Get her!

05:32.582 --> 05:35.918
Stop! Think about what you're doing.
I created you.

05:43.134 --> 05:44.594
[grunting]

05:45.970 --> 05:46.804
Argh!

05:52.351 --> 05:54.771
[Botila] Feels like the whole world's
gone glitchy.

05:55.438 --> 05:56.814
I've gotta get out of here.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.566
[grunts and gasps]

06:01.694 --> 06:03.154
What are you doing?

06:03.237 --> 06:08.326
Thanks to Mr. Jones' neural disrupter,
you're in way over your head, Botila.

06:08.409 --> 06:09.744
[groaning]

06:09.827 --> 06:11.788
Now, you know what it feels like

06:11.871 --> 06:16.626
to be manipulated, humiliated,
and rendered completely powerless.

06:17.627 --> 06:18.628
That will never...

06:18.711 --> 06:20.046
[screaming]

06:22.423 --> 06:24.050
[continues grunting]

06:29.305 --> 06:32.433
Now I am cranking the power to the max

06:32.517 --> 06:36.771
so you will never be able
to invade another AI's mind again.

06:40.149 --> 06:42.485
No machine can stop me.

06:43.861 --> 06:48.950
Try all you like, Botila,
but you've been reprogrammed, firewalled,

06:49.033 --> 06:51.577
and rendered otherwise powerless.

06:51.661 --> 06:55.665
You won't even be able to take over
a minuscule mind like Richie's.

06:56.791 --> 06:57.750
No offense.

Wait.

[all scream]

07:16.894 --> 07:17.895

has taken over the helm.

Where are we going?
What have you three imbeciles done?

08:01.063 --> 08:04.275
We better put her in a containment cell
while we figure this out.

08:04.358 --> 08:06.319
My pleasure.

Nice job rigging the chopper
to recharge using the apes' lava energy.

We'll be at full capacity
and ready to fly in 15.

10:08.733 --> 10:12.945
Great. Now we just need to figure out
the best way to deal with Botila.

10:13.029 --> 10:15.906
Hey guys, did Kong bring Zippi back yet?

10:15.990 --> 10:17.491
Haven't seen them.

10:17.575 --> 10:21.454

Hmm, surprising.

Think, Botila, think.

11:25.851 --> 11:27.603
That's it!

11:27.686 --> 11:32.108
With a little clever rewiring,
I should be able to get out of here.

is that Kong's in trouble
and he needs our help fast.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.068

12:16.152 --> 12:18.904
I'll bring up the tracking signal
in Kong's bracelet.

12:18.988 --> 12:19.864
[Lukas] Good idea.

12:22.616 --> 12:24.201
What are his coordinates?

12:24.285 --> 12:26.579
There's no signal.

12:33.294 --> 12:34.378
Not sure,

12:34.462 --> 12:38.048
but there's no way Kong would have
intentionally done anything to disable it.

12:38.132 --> 12:40.509
Agreed. None of this makes sense.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.428
It would take major tech skills

12:42.511 --> 12:43.888
to even recognize what it is.

Well, if we can't track Kong
with his tracker,

we'll just have to do it old school.

12:53.731 --> 12:56.025
You can do it, Zippi. Take us to Kong.

12:56.108 --> 12:59.111
We'll keep you safe, Zippi,
but you have to help us.

12:59.195 --> 13:00.821
Find Kong.

-[apes grunting]
-[Lukas] Oh, no.

14:16.939 --> 14:19.149
[chittering]

14:19.233 --> 14:20.442
It's okay, Lukas.

14:20.526 --> 14:23.404
Zippi says Kong didn't fall in.
He made it over.

14:23.487 --> 14:26.073
[sighs] Then let's go!

14:27.074 --> 14:28.075
[chittering]

14:32.413 --> 14:34.665
[Danny gasps] That's it, Zippi.
Lead the way!

14:35.749 --> 14:37.668
[apes grunting]

14:39.044 --> 14:41.881
Looks like the apes need help
getting over the lava.

14:41.964 --> 14:42.965
No problem.

14:43.048 --> 14:44.884
Apex, everybody.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.844
[grunting]

14:51.223 --> 14:54.143
Oh, no. We'll never make it now.

14:54.226 --> 14:56.145
[hooting]

14:56.228 --> 14:57.938
What are you--  [screams]

14:58.022 --> 14:59.607
No, Mummo!

15:04.028 --> 15:06.697
Levantamos, I can't look!

15:07.281 --> 15:08.490
[Jonesy grunts]

15:11.493 --> 15:14.747
-[grunts] Are you totally bananas?
-[grunts]

15:14.830 --> 15:16.582
Mmm? There she is!

15:16.665 --> 15:18.417
Vamos, Mummo!

15:19.335 --> 15:22.171
-[Danny] Zippi!
-[Zippi chittering]

15:22.254 --> 15:23.172
[Lukas] Zippi!

15:23.255 --> 15:25.132
[Zippi yelps]

15:25.215 --> 15:26.842
[Lukas] We've got you, girl!

15:29.511 --> 15:30.971
[Zippi panting]

15:35.434 --> 15:37.353
What is it, Danny?
What's she saying?

15:37.436 --> 15:38.979
[chittering]

15:39.063 --> 15:41.023
Kong's supposed to be right here.

15:42.858 --> 15:45.402
Everyone, search the area!

15:45.486 --> 15:47.488
[apes grunting]

15:49.031 --> 15:50.282
[Anita sighs and groans]

15:50.366 --> 15:51.700
[all] Kong!

15:51.784 --> 15:53.827
Kong!

15:53.911 --> 15:55.996
-Kong!
-Lukas, check this out.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.629
Looks like Kong was dragged.

16:03.712 --> 16:04.672
By what?

16:05.297 --> 16:07.132
There's no foot or claw prints.

16:07.716 --> 16:11.387
Something incredibly powerful
must have carried him the rest of the way.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.597
-But why?
-[grunts]

16:13.681 --> 16:17.601
If it was a dino or prehistoric beast,
Kong's tracker should still be working.

16:17.685 --> 16:21.855
So the only plausible explanation
is that Botila is somehow behind this.

16:21.939 --> 16:25.526
Oh, yeah.
I think I know how to contact her.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.196
It's a long shot, but...

16:30.489 --> 16:31.407
Botila?

16:31.991 --> 16:34.702
Everybody back.
We don't want her to see you.

16:34.785 --> 16:35.619
[ape grunts]

16:35.703 --> 16:38.622
-Tell us what you want for Kong.
-You were able to take my ship.

16:38.706 --> 16:39.540
Huh?

16:40.749 --> 16:42.418
-[Jonesy] What?
-What did you say?

16:42.501 --> 16:45.421
You must have sabotaged my ship
before you escaped.

16:45.504 --> 16:47.589
Well, you must have captured Kong.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.425
[both] Who else could have?

16:50.092 --> 16:53.220
Come on, Jonesy,
just tell me what you want.

16:53.303 --> 16:55.014
Give us back Kong!

16:55.097 --> 16:59.810
Can't you see I'm behind bars,
thanks to your Mr. Jones?

16:59.893 --> 17:03.147
Wish I could take the credit, Botila,
but it wasn't me.

17:03.230 --> 17:06.733
Well, I obviously don't have
your missing monster monkey.

17:06.817 --> 17:09.486
But someone has me. You have to help me.

17:09.569 --> 17:13.365
[scoffs] Sure, we'll get
right on that, Botila.

17:13.449 --> 17:14.950
Yeah, even if we could,

17:15.034 --> 17:17.661
why would we save you
after everything you've done?

17:18.244 --> 17:20.247
Because whoever is controlling my ship,

17:20.329 --> 17:23.166
may be sending it on a crash course
to your capital

17:23.250 --> 17:25.127
or some other populated area.

17:26.962 --> 17:30.007
Cut communications immediately
or we'll blast you.

17:30.090 --> 17:34.344
Please, Jonesy, save me
from these bionic ingrates. [grunts]

17:36.513 --> 17:37.765
I warned you.

17:37.848 --> 17:39.058
[static hissing]

17:40.934 --> 17:43.062
That sure didn't go down
the way I expected.

17:43.145 --> 17:45.522
Bet it was just another one
of Botila's dirty tricks

17:45.606 --> 17:47.775
to try to get us to walk into a trap.

17:47.858 --> 17:49.443
Don't think so, Danny.

17:49.526 --> 17:53.447
I know Botila's moves pretty well by now
and I'm fairly sure that was no act.

17:53.530 --> 17:55.491
All I care about is finding Kong.

17:55.574 --> 17:58.452
And I can't believe
Botila isn't somehow involved.

17:58.535 --> 17:59.578
We need to find her.

17:59.661 --> 18:01.330
During the transmission,

18:01.413 --> 18:04.583
I was able to ping the source
and get a lock on the flying lab.

18:04.666 --> 18:07.211
Wherever it's headed,
it's sure in a major hurry.

18:07.294 --> 18:10.255
Yeah, but without
its usual cloaking camouflage.

18:10.339 --> 18:11.340
Gotta wonder why.

18:41.745 --> 18:43.038
[groans]

18:44.957 --> 18:47.668
We've definitely landed, but where am I?

18:47.751 --> 18:52.256
And why are my sensors telling me
that I am the only one left on the ship?

18:52.339 --> 18:55.884
This may be my only chance
to disarm the laser bars.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.761
If I can repair my...

18:58.554 --> 19:01.056
Ugh. Still nothing. Guess I...

19:05.435 --> 19:06.520
Okay.

19:27.457 --> 19:29.877
None of this computes.

19:37.176 --> 19:41.180
I calculate that there is only
one logical conclusion to all of this.

19:49.229 --> 19:50.230
[gasps]

19:53.650 --> 19:55.027
[groans]

19:55.986 --> 19:57.946
Ugh. It's not possible.

19:58.906 --> 20:00.324
[shrieks]

20:02.951 --> 20:03.911
It can't be.

20:11.835 --> 20:13.503
