WEBVTT

00:08.083 --> 00:09.333
Whoa!

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
Okay, fellows,
you can use the front door.

00:13.083 --> 00:14.917
And if you need any water
or soda, it's in the
kitchen.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.542
- Help yourselves.
- Thank you.

00:16.625 --> 00:17.792
Real nice of you, sir.

00:24.250 --> 00:25.583
Kate, I thought
you were going to Barbie's

00:25.667 --> 00:26.667
to do your homework.

00:26.750 --> 00:28.583
She's coming over later.

00:28.667 --> 00:30.458
So these guys
are really ex-cons?

00:31.875 --> 00:34.583
Moving company hires them, helps
them get back on their feet.

00:34.667 --> 00:36.208
Hey, stop that.

00:36.291 --> 00:38.291
You're not worried
they'll steal something?

00:38.375 --> 00:40.125
I think people
deserve
a second chance.

00:41.250 --> 00:43.375
Like mom?

00:43.458 --> 00:45.375
- That's different.
- Yeah?

00:45.458 --> 00:47.458
Let's not do this
here, please.

00:48.709 --> 00:50.041
Fine.

00:51.166 --> 00:52.792
FYI, that's mine.

00:52.875 --> 00:54.750
[chuckles]
Uh, where would you
like me to put this?

00:54.834 --> 00:56.166
Upstairs, first room
on the right.

01:00.125 --> 01:02.417
You ready to see
your new room, honey?

01:02.500 --> 01:03.834
Come on.

01:20.542 --> 01:21.875
Beautiful house, sir.

01:21.959 --> 01:23.250
I think so.

01:24.750 --> 01:25.917
And you?

01:26.917 --> 01:28.250
I wanna go home.

01:30.166 --> 01:31.625
I'll get the rest
of the boxes.

01:35.667 --> 01:38.125
I'm doing the best
I can here, Kate.

01:38.208 --> 01:39.834
- I miss mom.
- So do I.

01:39.917 --> 01:41.542
Then why did you put her
in that place again?

01:41.625 --> 01:43.417
- She's sick again, honey,
and--
- She's not sick.

01:43.500 --> 01:45.667
If she doesn't stop
drinking this time

01:45.750 --> 01:47.166
she's gonna kill herself.

01:56.125 --> 01:58.000
I ought to get
back
down there.

02:46.250 --> 02:47.750
Feel anything?

02:50.625 --> 02:52.083
The AC's dead.

02:52.166 --> 02:54.583
It's not even 9:00 'o clock and
it feels like it's 90 degrees.

02:54.667 --> 02:57.792
(Rush)
'Oh, weatherman says
no let up in sight.'

02:57.875 --> 02:59.208
What's that gonna do?

02:59.291 --> 03:00.542
Do you feel that?

03:01.500 --> 03:03.166
I think it's workin'.

03:03.250 --> 03:05.458
An inmate's been
calling
all morning for you.

03:05.542 --> 03:07.083
Hmm.

03:07.166 --> 03:09.250
Andre Tibbs.

03:09.333 --> 03:10.792
Blast from the past.

03:10.875 --> 03:13.000
The name's
familiar.
He on the row?

03:13.083 --> 03:17.083
Got lethal injection for the
rape, murder of a kid in '94.

03:17.166 --> 03:18.417
You work that job?

03:18.500 --> 03:20.250
Interrogated him, yeah.

03:20.333 --> 03:21.667
He confessed?

03:21.750 --> 03:23.750
No, and if the evidence
hadn't been so airtight

03:23.834 --> 03:26.417
I would have beat it out of
him
for what he did to that girl.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.000
So why's he bugging you now?

03:28.083 --> 03:29.375
My guess..

03:30.500 --> 03:31.959
This.

03:32.041 --> 03:33.959
'Joey Norman,
cop in the 17th.'

03:34.041 --> 03:35.792
'Thought I knew him, right?'

03:35.875 --> 03:37.250
'Turns out the guy was dirty.'

03:37.333 --> 03:39.375
Planting drugs,
taking payoffs.

03:39.458 --> 03:41.125
And now, the DA's
office
is worried.

03:41.208 --> 03:42.959
He's screwed up
three of their
cases.

03:43.041 --> 03:45.166
(Vera)
'So the guy blows
his brains out.'

03:45.250 --> 03:46.959
So what's the connect?
I mean..

03:47.041 --> 03:49.625
Dirty cop,
death row inmate?

03:49.709 --> 03:51.875
Andre Tibbs always claimed
he was framed

03:51.959 --> 03:54.125
by his arresting officer..

03:54.208 --> 03:55.917
...Joey Norman.

04:01.959 --> 04:03.625
Homicide.

04:03.709 --> 04:05.417
Yeah, I'll accept the charges.

04:07.375 --> 04:08.542
Andre?

04:08.625 --> 04:12.166
- They call me Mr. Tibbs.
- 'Right.'

04:12.250 --> 04:13.750
A regular Sidney Poitier.

04:13.834 --> 04:15.333
Call me to talk
about the movies,
Andre?

04:15.417 --> 04:18.667
I heard about that dirty cop,
Norman offin' himself.

04:18.750 --> 04:20.041
What did I tell you?

04:20.125 --> 04:22.083
Got nothing to
do
with your case.

04:22.166 --> 04:24.000
Man arrested me, remember?

04:24.083 --> 04:25.834
Framed me.

04:25.917 --> 04:29.125
Nabbed that letter
from my back pocket.

04:29.208 --> 04:31.041
That letter was never
going to prove you innocent.

04:31.125 --> 04:32.917
But it would prove
that cop a liar.

04:34.083 --> 04:36.083
And maybe
you'd believe my story.

04:36.166 --> 04:37.333
Tell it to your lawyers.

04:37.417 --> 04:39.583
I'm done with them
snakes in the grass.

04:41.083 --> 04:43.875
- I'm telling it to you.
- Nobody framed you, Andre.

04:43.959 --> 04:45.333
So what if he did?

04:46.917 --> 04:48.458
You're not gonna wonder
about that?

04:49.667 --> 04:51.166
Why should I?

04:51.250 --> 04:52.667
My execution is set.

04:54.041 --> 04:56.083
They're gonna kill me
in three days.

05:13.959 --> 05:17.417
Uh, never thought I'd be so
happy to be coming down here.

05:17.500 --> 05:20.417
[chuckles]
Only cool spot
in the whole
place.

05:20.500 --> 05:21.667
What do we got?

05:21.750 --> 05:24.375
Kate Lange, 16, raped
and stabbed to death.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.166
Andre Tibbs
was the only suspect.

05:26.250 --> 05:27.875
Ah, he'd just been
released
from county.

05:27.959 --> 05:29.500
He did three years for assault.

05:29.583 --> 05:31.041
(Jeffries)
'Yeah, was working
for a moving company'

05:31.125 --> 05:32.875
at the girl's house
the day of the murder.

05:32.959 --> 05:35.417
Uh, that night,
Kate's father heard a
noise.

05:35.500 --> 05:36.917
Came downstairs, saw Andre

05:37.000 --> 05:38.667
standing over
his daughter's
body.

05:38.750 --> 05:40.125
He made a positive ID.

05:40.208 --> 05:42.792
Officer Norman caught Andre
running from the scene

05:42.875 --> 05:44.458
with blood on his boots.

05:44.542 --> 05:46.333
Blood that matched the victim's.

05:46.417 --> 05:48.500
Well, that's open and closed.

05:48.583 --> 05:50.000
What about this letter?

05:50.083 --> 05:53.125
Andre claims this dirty
cop
took off of him.

05:53.208 --> 05:54.875
Some apology to Mr. Lange

05:54.959 --> 05:56.375
for mouthing off
during the move.

05:57.667 --> 05:59.375
Internal Affairs
would
have the letter
now.

05:59.458 --> 06:01.750
They've been through Norman's
desk, locker, house.

06:01.834 --> 06:03.083
Yeah, if it exists.

06:03.166 --> 06:04.709
And state's killing
him
in three days.

06:04.792 --> 06:08.208
We don't need anyone wondering
if we got the right guy.

06:15.583 --> 06:17.625
Got to you, huh?

06:17.709 --> 06:19.375
This all a game
to you, Andre?

06:19.458 --> 06:21.458
Getting your kicks
before you die?

06:21.542 --> 06:23.333
Get 'em while I can.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.583
And you are?

06:25.667 --> 06:26.792
Detective Miller.

06:26.875 --> 06:28.792
Welcome to the
row,
baby girl.

06:28.875 --> 06:30.083
Don't you baby girl me, Tibbs

06:30.166 --> 06:32.917
or your black ass
goes back to isolation.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.250
[chuckles]
Gotta earn it first,
right?

06:38.291 --> 06:39.959
You find the letter
that cop took?

06:40.041 --> 06:42.083
- If there was a letter.
- There was.

06:42.166 --> 06:45.709
Even so, be a long shot
Officer Norman held onto it.

06:45.792 --> 06:47.291
Forget the letter.

06:47.375 --> 06:49.792
The blood, the ID,
that's your
problem.

06:49.875 --> 06:51.750
Look, I said a million times

06:51.834 --> 06:56.125
that there was blood on my boots
because I was inside that house.

06:56.208 --> 06:58.875
Delivering that apology
letter,
right?

06:58.959 --> 07:01.542
I lost my cool
earlier that day.

07:01.625 --> 07:04.917
I went back that night.
The door was open.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.458
I go inside.

07:06.542 --> 07:08.417
And that's when I seen her.

07:08.500 --> 07:11.000
And you just up and
ran.
Why not help?

07:11.083 --> 07:13.250
Look in the mirror, brother.
You would have run too.

07:13.333 --> 07:15.417
- I didn't kill anyone.
- Neither did I.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.417
Bottom line is that girl's
father saw you.

07:17.500 --> 07:20.125
And I told you again and again
that that man is lying.

07:20.208 --> 07:21.500
Why would he do that?

07:21.583 --> 07:23.750
Because I pissed him
off that day.

07:26.542 --> 07:28.834
Dad, what are we doing
for dinner?

07:28.917 --> 07:30.500
I haven't
thought
about it yet.

07:30.583 --> 07:32.875
Do we have chocolate milk
in the fridge?

07:32.959 --> 07:35.208
The fridge isn't plugged in
yet, honey.

07:35.291 --> 07:36.500
'Hey, the vanity
and the mirror.'

07:36.583 --> 07:38.542
You wanted that
in your room, right?

07:38.625 --> 07:40.375
Whatever.
It's not even mine.

07:43.625 --> 07:45.417
That's one of the last things
to bring in there.

07:46.625 --> 07:48.333
I'm on it, boss.

07:48.417 --> 07:50.291
(Wayne)
'Sixteen can be tough, huh?'

07:50.375 --> 07:52.917
- You got kids?
- Girl, same age.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.041
Me and my daughter
always been close though.

07:55.125 --> 07:57.375
'Sometimes, they turn out
that way.'

07:57.458 --> 07:58.875
(Lange)
'Lucky.'

08:03.583 --> 08:05.125
Need a break there, Andre?

08:05.208 --> 08:07.792
[panting]
I'm just, uh, just
getting my grip, boss.

08:09.417 --> 08:12.709
- He okay?
- Yeah, he's got his
problems.

08:12.792 --> 08:14.166
Drinkin'.

08:16.500 --> 08:19.709
- Hey, let me help.
- No, no, I'm-I'm good.

08:19.792 --> 08:21.166
Uh, it's okay.
This is
valuable.

08:21.250 --> 08:23.375
Belonged to my wife
when she was a girl.

08:23.458 --> 08:25.208
Please, let it go. You're
making
me look bad now.

08:25.291 --> 08:27.417
- Let's just put it down.
- No! Come on!

08:30.750 --> 08:32.458
What the hell
is wrong with
you?

08:32.542 --> 08:34.667
I asked you to let it go.
I said I had it.

08:34.750 --> 08:36.458
- Well, you didn't.
- Look, get out of my face.

08:36.542 --> 08:37.709
You have any idea
what you just did?

08:37.792 --> 08:39.375
I said get out of my face!

08:39.458 --> 08:41.542
♪ ...wanted was
something like a job

08:41.625 --> 08:43.083
You're done, Tibbs!

08:44.208 --> 08:46.709
Look, I-I need this job.

08:48.417 --> 08:50.000
Sorry. Clear out.

09:03.083 --> 09:06.125
(Miller)
'So you got fired, left..'

09:06.208 --> 09:07.125
...then what?

09:07.208 --> 09:10.125
I started off strong that day

09:10.208 --> 09:13.083
but by that point,
I needed a drink, bad.

09:13.166 --> 09:15.750
So back to my corner stool
I went.

09:15.834 --> 09:17.291
(Jeffries)
'Right, get your courage up'

09:17.375 --> 09:18.792
start thinking
about that little girl.

09:18.875 --> 09:23.125
No. Got my courage up
and wrote up that apology.

09:23.208 --> 09:25.291
Why did you wait till 1:00
a.m.
to drop it off?

09:25.375 --> 09:28.542
Because I thought if I could
just make it to last call

09:28.625 --> 09:30.750
and not pick up my glass

09:30.834 --> 09:33.875
that I would have a,
I'd have a chance at a life.

09:35.875 --> 09:37.500
Time's up, Tibbs.
Let's go.

09:39.375 --> 09:42.500
Less than three days left,
and counting.

09:42.583 --> 09:45.000
Why not go out
by telling the truth?

09:45.083 --> 09:47.208
Like I said..

09:47.291 --> 09:48.667
...I already did.

09:55.709 --> 09:58.333
(Lange)
I never believed
in the death penalty.

09:58.417 --> 10:01.458
But the minute I walked into
that kitchen and saw my girl..

10:03.125 --> 10:04.458
...my thinking changed
right there.

10:04.542 --> 10:05.917
And you're sure
Andre Tibbs did it?

10:06.000 --> 10:07.333
Of course, I'm sure.

10:07.417 --> 10:08.875
'Cause you positively
identified him

10:08.959 --> 10:10.667
as the man
who killed your daughter.

10:10.750 --> 10:11.875
Yes, I did.

10:11.959 --> 10:13.500
And you're sure Officer Norman

10:13.583 --> 10:15.083
didn't influence that call?

10:18.208 --> 10:20.750
If you're 100
percent
certain he did it

10:20.834 --> 10:22.458
we just need you
to tell us that.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.709
I was the one who found
Kate's body that night.

10:31.208 --> 10:33.041
Somebody had to pay.

10:37.583 --> 10:38.875
I heard a noise.

10:40.542 --> 10:43.333
- I came downstairs, I saw--
- Take your time.

10:46.792 --> 10:48.041
Is that him?

10:51.583 --> 10:54.125
From the moving company.
He was here today.

10:54.208 --> 10:55.583
And is he the man
you saw..

10:56.792 --> 10:58.000
...in your home tonight?

10:58.083 --> 10:59.583
I hired him.

10:59.667 --> 11:01.041
I brought him here.

11:01.125 --> 11:02.458
Mr. Lange.

11:04.458 --> 11:06.875
I need you to focus, alright?

11:08.750 --> 11:10.417
Is that the man you saw?

11:11.583 --> 11:12.959
I didn't see.

11:15.417 --> 11:19.583
I, I heard
some-something.
Footsteps, running.

11:19.667 --> 11:21.291
I found him three blocks
from here.

11:22.583 --> 11:23.792
Running with blood
on his boots.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.583
He did it.

11:28.667 --> 11:30.500
You know it, I know it.

11:33.709 --> 11:34.834
He's gotta pay for that.

11:39.583 --> 11:41.500
(Norman)
'Let's start over, Mr.
Lange.'

11:43.792 --> 11:45.583
Is that the man
you saw tonight?

11:57.417 --> 11:59.291
Yes.

12:02.041 --> 12:06.291
My daughter's blood was on
his shoes. It had to be him.

12:06.375 --> 12:09.709
But you didn't see Andre
in your house that night?

12:13.917 --> 12:16.041
You never saw him.

12:16.125 --> 12:17.291
Did you?

12:22.500 --> 12:23.583
No.

12:26.250 --> 12:27.625
I never saw anyone.

12:40.792 --> 12:42.792
What the hell
is this all about?

12:42.875 --> 12:44.458
Don't sit.

12:44.542 --> 12:45.750
Mike Lange changed his story.

12:45.834 --> 12:48.208
ID in his daughter's
case
is no good.

12:48.291 --> 12:50.500
We want access to the evidence
in Norman's case.

12:50.583 --> 12:52.000
IA isn't granting it.

12:52.083 --> 12:55.166
Tibbs ran through all
his appeals. Case is closed.

12:55.250 --> 12:56.542
If Norman tampered
with evidence

12:56.625 --> 12:57.667
the integrity of the case is--

12:57.750 --> 12:59.250
I prosecuted this.

12:59.333 --> 13:00.750
Busted my ass.

13:00.834 --> 13:01.917
You questioning my integrity?

13:02.000 --> 13:03.583
ID is out the window.

13:03.667 --> 13:05.000
That doesn't mean
anything to you?

13:05.083 --> 13:06.792
This guy stupid or what?

13:06.875 --> 13:09.667
'Speculation that another case
was tainted by Officer Norman'

13:09.750 --> 13:11.709
is just that speculation.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.375
(Stillman)
'Oh, Danner, I know
you've already taken'

13:13.458 --> 13:14.709
hits on your cases
because of Norman.

13:14.792 --> 13:16.458
Search warrant's all
we're asking.

13:16.542 --> 13:17.542
Internal Affairs
will get through

13:17.625 --> 13:18.583
the inventory on their own time.

13:18.667 --> 13:19.792
Oh, that could take ten years.

13:19.875 --> 13:21.542
- Andre Tibbs has got two
days.
- Tough.

13:21.625 --> 13:23.709
(Jeffries)
'So if an innocent man dies
tomorrow night'

13:23.792 --> 13:25.125
you don't care.

13:25.208 --> 13:27.500
I've told you
our position on
this.

13:27.583 --> 13:29.083
Now, please.

13:29.166 --> 13:31.000
Before I drop-kick you both
out of my office.

13:38.583 --> 13:41.041
You know, I was-I was
trying to do some good

13:41.125 --> 13:43.000
by hiring these ex-cons,
and then this..

13:43.917 --> 13:45.291
...little girl ends up dead.

13:45.375 --> 13:46.709
Worst nightmare, huh?

13:46.792 --> 13:48.959
If something like that
happened to my daughter..

13:50.291 --> 13:51.583
...I don't know
how I'd go on.

13:52.709 --> 13:54.709
She's all I got in this world.

13:54.792 --> 13:57.000
Mr. Nelson, you had
trouble
with Andre that day

13:57.083 --> 13:58.166
over him
breaking a
mirror?

13:58.250 --> 13:59.959
Yeah, I suppose so.

14:00.041 --> 14:02.500
Before he walked off the job,
do you remember him

14:02.583 --> 14:05.125
threatening Mike Lange
or his daughter?

14:05.208 --> 14:06.417
No.

14:06.500 --> 14:07.667
Notice anything odd

14:07.750 --> 14:10.250
maybe how Andre
was looking at her?

14:10.333 --> 14:12.458
Hey, I'm realistic,
um, you know.

14:12.542 --> 14:15.250
Some guys will look at any
girl,
young or old, but..

14:15.333 --> 14:17.917
...my concern was don't touch.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.750
And Andre, did he touch?

14:19.834 --> 14:21.041
No.

14:22.834 --> 14:24.834
You know, I was trying
to keep my business alive.

14:24.917 --> 14:27.542
I-I didn't think it mattered.

14:27.625 --> 14:28.959
Understood. Go on.

14:30.458 --> 14:33.417
That day, early on, uh,
before I fired Andre

14:33.500 --> 14:36.125
Mr. Lange offered
to buy us lunch.

14:36.208 --> 14:39.083
So he gave me
his car keys, and, uh..

14:41.709 --> 14:43.166
...I gave them to Andre.

14:45.041 --> 14:46.458
- Here.
- What's this?

14:46.542 --> 14:48.041
(Wayne)
'That's the keys to Mike's
car.'

14:48.125 --> 14:51.208
He buys, we fly.
Better I stay
here.

14:51.291 --> 14:52.875
But you're sure
he'd want me in his car?

14:52.959 --> 14:54.750
Yeah, go on, hurry up.

14:54.834 --> 14:56.333
Make it burgers, okay?

14:59.041 --> 15:00.792
Headin' out?

15:00.875 --> 15:02.417
How about getting us
some beers?

15:02.500 --> 15:05.291
- Leave him alone, Barbie.
- Sorry, girls, can't do
that.

15:05.375 --> 15:08.792
- So what's prison like?
- Shut up, you dork. God!

15:08.875 --> 15:10.041
I mean 'cause you can
totally tell us

15:10.125 --> 15:11.625
if you got shanked and stuff.

15:14.750 --> 15:16.583
Beep, beep, beep,
paging Mr. Drug Dealer.

15:16.667 --> 15:18.166
You're a total freak.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.041
You wanna give me that back
so I can do this food run?

15:20.125 --> 15:21.166
Give it back.

15:21.250 --> 15:23.333
Not till
he answers my
question.

15:23.417 --> 15:27.250
- So, why were you in prison?
- Sure you wanna know?

15:27.333 --> 15:29.291
Yeah.

15:29.375 --> 15:30.792
Beat a man almost to death.

15:32.875 --> 15:33.834
Why?

15:33.917 --> 15:35.667
(Tibbs)
'Why what?'

15:35.750 --> 15:37.166
Why do that?

15:38.166 --> 15:39.667
I was drunk, that's why.

15:41.959 --> 15:44.041
Guess that's why
no beer run, huh?

15:44.125 --> 15:45.625
Give him his pager, Barbie.

15:50.500 --> 15:52.125
You need some help
getting food?

15:54.291 --> 15:55.667
(Wayne)
'Andre, you still here?'

15:55.750 --> 15:57.375
We're getting hungry!
Let's go!

16:06.250 --> 16:09.000
Exactly how long
were they gone?

16:09.083 --> 16:11.375
Well, long enough, I mean..

16:11.458 --> 16:12.917
Burger place wasn't that far.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.917
So, long enough to make
a set of those keys.

16:16.417 --> 16:18.709
Which could explain
why no forced entry.

16:23.291 --> 16:24.709
Andre never got out
of the car.

16:24.792 --> 16:26.500
Those keys never left
the ignition.

16:27.959 --> 16:29.875
Read this interview
you gave back in '94

16:29.959 --> 16:31.875
and nowhere in here
do you mention

16:31.959 --> 16:34.208
driving off
for a long lunch with Andre.

16:34.291 --> 16:35.375
I was 16.

16:35.458 --> 16:36.709
I wasn't gonna let
my parents know

16:36.792 --> 16:39.458
I tried to seduce
an ex-con.

16:39.542 --> 16:41.166
So this Andre..

16:41.250 --> 16:42.625
...he stop anywhere else?

16:42.709 --> 16:44.417
Like a key place?

16:44.500 --> 16:45.959
Just the burger joint.

16:46.041 --> 16:47.458
You two were gone
quite a while.

16:49.333 --> 16:51.750
'Cause I gave him
wrong directions.

16:51.834 --> 16:53.625
'Wanted to get lost with him.'

16:53.709 --> 16:55.041
But he didn't go for it.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.959
Got anything else to tell,
now's the time.

17:00.041 --> 17:01.959
It was my fault.

17:02.041 --> 17:03.583
What happened to Kate.

17:03.667 --> 17:05.834
Why do you say that?

17:05.917 --> 17:07.417
I was always
looking
for a hook-up

17:07.500 --> 17:09.458
even when there wasn't one.

17:13.792 --> 17:16.125
(Tibbs)
'You need to wrap these boxes
a little better.'

17:16.208 --> 17:17.709
Oh, sorry.

17:24.959 --> 17:26.542
This box go up
to your room?

17:26.625 --> 17:27.834
Nope, attic.

17:29.125 --> 17:30.458
'You sure about that?'

17:34.291 --> 17:35.417
Nice photo.

17:38.166 --> 17:40.208
I learned how to use
a timer that day.

17:41.792 --> 17:44.166
- My mom taught me how.
- 'Did she?'

17:47.375 --> 17:49.458
Are you better?

17:49.542 --> 17:51.625
Better?

17:51.709 --> 17:53.333
The drinking.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.291
Forget it,
it's none of my
business.

17:58.375 --> 18:00.291
I'm acting like Barbie now.

18:00.375 --> 18:02.625
No, every-everyone's
got their own point.

18:02.709 --> 18:04.417
See, their, their own bottom

18:04.500 --> 18:07.500
when there's no place
lower you can go but there.

18:07.583 --> 18:09.375
And when you hit that..

18:09.458 --> 18:11.333
...you die..

18:11.417 --> 18:13.625
...or you close your eyes
and believe.

18:15.625 --> 18:16.917
Believe what?

18:18.083 --> 18:19.375
There's something bigger
out there

18:19.458 --> 18:21.000
than what's eating you alive.

18:22.583 --> 18:24.000
Somethin' better.

18:25.375 --> 18:26.542
Is there something better?

18:28.583 --> 18:29.959
It's up to you to find it.

18:31.875 --> 18:33.333
What if you don't?

18:36.500 --> 18:37.917
Andre.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.417
Need your help out here.

18:43.333 --> 18:44.709
You might wanna
hold onto that.

18:45.834 --> 18:47.250
Maybe I will.

19:01.667 --> 19:03.375
They had this
connection,
and I..

19:03.458 --> 19:05.000
...didn't want her
to just leave it at
that.

19:05.083 --> 19:06.375
So what did you do about it?

19:06.458 --> 19:08.750
I got Andre's number
off his pager.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.792
And did you use it?

19:13.125 --> 19:14.166
Not me.

19:15.625 --> 19:17.834
I dared her to page him.

19:17.917 --> 19:19.458
'Bugged her all day.'

19:19.542 --> 19:20.875
And she finally did.

19:20.959 --> 19:22.250
Late that night.

19:23.583 --> 19:25.125
And he called right back.

19:27.458 --> 19:30.667
So, Andre called Kate
the night of the murder?

19:42.125 --> 19:44.709
(Jeffries)
'You called Kate Lange
the night she died.'

19:44.792 --> 19:46.375
- What?
- After she paged you.

19:47.667 --> 19:48.625
What are you talking about?

19:48.709 --> 19:50.500
We got her phone records, Andre.

19:50.583 --> 19:53.208
Shows all the outgoing
numbers
that night.

19:53.291 --> 19:56.125
This one look
familiar?
Your pager.

19:56.208 --> 19:58.875
I lost my pager that day
during the move.

19:58.959 --> 20:00.583
- That's the truth.
- Sure, you did.

20:00.667 --> 20:01.792
I never called that girl.

20:01.875 --> 20:04.083
- I've no reason to believe
you.
- It's true.

20:04.166 --> 20:05.375
You had her blood
on your boots.

20:05.458 --> 20:06.875
I found her body.

20:06.959 --> 20:09.166
- You raped and killed her.
- I didn't.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.125
In the den,
earlier that
day

20:12.208 --> 20:13.583
you were alone with Kate.

20:13.667 --> 20:14.542
What?

20:14.625 --> 20:16.083
That photo of her mom

20:16.166 --> 20:17.792
on the beach?

20:17.875 --> 20:18.834
Finding something bigger

20:18.917 --> 20:20.041
'something better?'

20:20.125 --> 20:21.333
Want me to go on?

20:21.417 --> 20:22.458
Look, there's some
things
that ain't got

20:22.542 --> 20:23.625
nothing to do with this case.

20:23.709 --> 20:25.041
If you spent time together

20:25.125 --> 20:26.667
it's got everything
to do with this case--

20:26.750 --> 20:28.291
Look, I say different.

20:28.375 --> 20:31.458
I don't see how talking about
old chit-chat's gonna help me.

20:31.542 --> 20:33.166
Maybe it'll lead us
to the truth.

20:33.250 --> 20:34.750
Lead you to the truth.

20:34.834 --> 20:36.625
I'm not gonna tell you
I did it

20:36.709 --> 20:38.291
if that's what's going on here.

20:39.542 --> 20:41.208
We're way past lies, Andre.

20:42.291 --> 20:43.625
Today's the day.

20:43.709 --> 20:45.166
You got seven hours left.

20:47.041 --> 20:49.959
We're not so different,
you and me.

20:50.041 --> 20:52.417
You and me are nothing alike.

20:52.500 --> 20:55.333
Two black men
from the same neighborhood.

20:55.417 --> 20:58.083
If the ball had
bounced
just a little bit
different

20:58.166 --> 21:02.000
you could be sitting over
here,
and me over there.

21:02.083 --> 21:04.375
I never raped and murdered
a little girl.

21:06.583 --> 21:07.959
Neither did I.

21:10.250 --> 21:11.709
You wanna spend
your last hours on earth

21:11.792 --> 21:14.208
telling yourself more lies.

21:14.291 --> 21:16.375
Be my guest.

21:16.458 --> 21:19.166
Where are you going?
Hey, don't walk away from
me!

21:19.250 --> 21:20.875
'Do not walk away from me!'

21:39.500 --> 21:40.625
Mr. Lange.

21:41.792 --> 21:43.166
I was on my way
to the prison.

21:44.500 --> 21:45.875
Execution's set
for midnight.

21:46.917 --> 21:47.917
How can we help you?

21:48.000 --> 21:49.250
Barbie called today.

21:50.125 --> 21:51.750
She's torn up.

21:51.834 --> 21:53.875
She blames herself
for what happened to Kate.

21:53.959 --> 21:56.166
But it wasn't her fault.
It wasn't anyone's fault.

21:57.208 --> 21:58.792
- No.
- 'Except him.'

21:58.875 --> 22:00.250
And that's why I'm here.

22:00.333 --> 22:02.583
I know he's the one
who killed my daughter.

22:02.667 --> 22:03.834
Okay.

22:03.917 --> 22:07.083
But I wanna come clean
about...everything.

22:11.750 --> 22:14.542
He called Kate that night..

22:14.625 --> 22:16.625
...on the phone.

22:16.709 --> 22:19.083
- And you knew about that?
- It was almost midnight.

22:19.166 --> 22:21.750
I heard the phone ring,
the two of them talking.

22:21.834 --> 22:24.041
Why not tell
the police about it?

22:24.125 --> 22:26.667
- More evidence against Andre.
- I didn't think I needed to.

22:26.750 --> 22:28.333
I figured you had him
dead to rights.

22:28.417 --> 22:29.875
And because
there was no forced
entry

22:29.959 --> 22:32.166
you were worried
Kate let him in.

22:32.250 --> 22:34.083
If word had gotten out
about that

22:34.166 --> 22:36.250
people would have said
she brought it on herself.

22:37.458 --> 22:39.417
Right.

22:39.500 --> 22:40.667
I have this..

22:41.667 --> 22:43.917
...dream some nights.

22:45.709 --> 22:47.667
I'm back at the old house..

22:47.750 --> 22:50.375
...and Kate and her mom
are there. We all are.

22:53.792 --> 22:55.250
And Kate is smiling.

22:57.166 --> 22:58.458
She's so happy.

23:00.166 --> 23:01.583
And she says to me..

23:03.667 --> 23:04.917
"Daddy..

23:06.583 --> 23:07.959
...we're home."

23:10.250 --> 23:12.417
(Kate)
Sorry, my dad was yelling
at you today.

23:15.625 --> 23:16.834
I've gotta go.

23:20.208 --> 23:22.166
Who's calling at this hour?

23:22.250 --> 23:23.917
No one.

23:26.625 --> 23:28.458
(Lange)
'"Andre?"'

23:28.542 --> 23:29.917
The moving man?

23:30.000 --> 23:32.291
What? No, God.

23:32.375 --> 23:34.041
Why are you talking
to him, Kate?

23:35.583 --> 23:37.458
You wouldn't understand.

23:37.542 --> 23:39.250
Forget it.

23:39.333 --> 23:40.709
Try me.

23:55.083 --> 23:56.625
I gave her..

23:57.709 --> 23:59.542
..all the chances I could.

24:00.792 --> 24:02.041
'Your mom.'

24:03.500 --> 24:05.709
'But sometimes,
if something breaks'

24:05.792 --> 24:08.500
inside a person,
it can't be fixed.

24:11.500 --> 24:13.709
I know this isn't home, Kate

24:13.792 --> 24:16.667
but maybe it will be
one day.

24:19.834 --> 24:20.875
Hey.

24:22.917 --> 24:24.291
The fridge is working now.

24:25.709 --> 24:27.125
Got your chocolate milk too.

24:38.500 --> 24:39.792
Love you, daddy.

24:42.208 --> 24:43.667
'Love you too.'

24:53.750 --> 24:55.667
We never had a chance
to start over.

24:57.291 --> 24:59.041
That night wasn't your fault.

24:59.125 --> 25:00.333
[softly]
Yeah.

25:04.917 --> 25:06.417
Well, I better get going.

25:06.500 --> 25:08.375
- It's getting close to
time.
- Yeah.

25:10.041 --> 25:11.417
You sure you wanna be there?

25:13.667 --> 25:14.959
I've been lost..

25:16.125 --> 25:17.625
...for 12 years.

25:21.083 --> 25:23.166
Maybe this will bring
some peace.

25:42.792 --> 25:44.208
Wasn't sure
you'd come back.

25:45.792 --> 25:48.750
Been better if you'd asked
for
a spiritual advisor or a
priest.

25:49.750 --> 25:51.834
Priest can't help me now.

25:51.917 --> 25:53.208
You can.

25:53.291 --> 25:54.458
How am I gonna do that?

25:54.542 --> 25:55.750
I'd have to
believe
you're innocent.

25:55.834 --> 25:58.291
- I don't.
- But you did.

25:58.375 --> 26:00.375
Somewhere along the way.

26:00.458 --> 26:02.041
So maybe you will again.

26:06.041 --> 26:07.375
'You know nothing's changed.'

26:07.458 --> 26:09.667
'Your execution is going ahead
as scheduled.'

26:12.333 --> 26:13.875
I've been informed.

26:17.834 --> 26:19.208
Heat's about to break.

26:20.291 --> 26:21.417
I can feel it.

26:23.083 --> 26:27.000
Every since I ripped up my
knee
playing summer league..

26:27.083 --> 26:29.083
...I could always tell
when the rain's coming.

26:30.875 --> 26:32.875
Basketball.

26:32.959 --> 26:35.583
Ninth grade,
and it was all over.

26:37.125 --> 26:39.625
I wasn't going pro
or nothing.

26:39.709 --> 26:41.375
But one college
was lookin' at me.

26:43.458 --> 26:45.667
Pretty sure
I could have got that.

26:45.750 --> 26:47.959
Tore up my knee
playing
linebacker.

26:50.166 --> 26:51.542
Yeah?

26:51.625 --> 26:54.375
Never got the benefit of
predicting the weather
though.

26:54.458 --> 26:56.041
Just the pain.

27:01.750 --> 27:04.166
'I saw a man die once..'

27:04.250 --> 27:06.375
...in this place, years ago.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.250
He lived a life
full of lies.

27:09.333 --> 27:11.500
So many lies,
he couldn't see through.

27:13.500 --> 27:15.041
But in here..

27:15.125 --> 27:16.667
...in those last moments..

27:17.959 --> 27:19.458
...I could see in his eyes

27:19.542 --> 27:21.500
he was ready to tell.

27:24.125 --> 27:25.208
Tell what?

27:26.375 --> 27:27.667
The truth.

27:31.250 --> 27:33.667
Let's go,
Tibbs.
It's time.

27:54.500 --> 27:56.125
Got a dead man walking here!

28:41.875 --> 28:43.291
Any last words, Tibbs?

28:50.417 --> 28:51.875
I'm sorry for you, sir.

28:54.250 --> 28:55.500
She was a nice girl.

28:56.875 --> 28:58.625
Maybe this will help you
somehow.

29:11.291 --> 29:13.083
Last moment.

29:13.166 --> 29:14.750
Time for truth,
like you said.

29:17.917 --> 29:19.125
I'll tell it to you.

29:20.542 --> 29:22.750
But all it is is what
I've been saying all along.

29:45.917 --> 29:47.125
Hello?

29:58.291 --> 29:59.750
Are you alright over there?

30:01.291 --> 30:02.417
Hello.

30:04.375 --> 30:05.500
Oh, God.

30:08.709 --> 30:10.000
Oh!

30:12.709 --> 30:14.041
I gotta get help.

30:17.959 --> 30:19.375
Faith.

30:19.458 --> 30:20.750
What?

30:22.417 --> 30:23.458
Faith.

30:23.542 --> 30:25.417
- Faith?
- Mm-hmm.

30:26.834 --> 30:28.166
You found faith?

30:29.625 --> 30:31.291
Didn't I tell you you would?

30:33.083 --> 30:34.959
See, you're not alone, alright?

30:36.458 --> 30:37.917
I'm gonna go and get help.

30:39.166 --> 30:40.375
Don't leave me.

30:50.542 --> 30:52.208
<i>(Tibbs)</i>
<i>There's something</i>
<i>out there bigger</i>

30:52.291 --> 30:54.375
than what's eating me alive.

30:54.458 --> 30:56.625
Something better.

30:56.709 --> 30:58.667
And if that little girl
found it..

30:59.917 --> 31:01.166
...I'll find it too.

31:02.834 --> 31:04.250
I gotta believe that.

31:05.750 --> 31:07.667
That I'll find some peace.

31:13.500 --> 31:14.917
Look into my eyes.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.583
It has been there all along.

31:19.458 --> 31:20.709
Truth.

31:56.375 --> 31:58.583
[gasping]
Prove me innocent.

32:25.333 --> 32:28.375
(Vera)
Will, what are you doin'?

32:28.458 --> 32:30.333
We don't get a
warrant
to be here.

32:30.417 --> 32:31.792
Andre's letter.

32:32.959 --> 32:36.166
- Son of a bitch.
- I didn't believe him.

32:36.250 --> 32:38.667
You believed the cop.
You should have been able
to.

32:38.750 --> 32:39.959
Good thing Norman ate his gun

32:40.041 --> 32:42.917
or I'd be feeding it
to him right now.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.041
What's it say?

32:45.125 --> 32:46.458
"Dear, Mr. Lange.

32:46.542 --> 32:49.125
"I've been sitting
in this bar two hours now

32:49.208 --> 32:52.667
trying to make sense of
the world on a piece of
paper."

32:52.750 --> 32:54.959
<i>(Tibbs)</i>
<i>But maybe there's just</i>
<i>this place in the end</i>

32:55.041 --> 32:57.291
<i>this drink I'm staring into</i>

32:57.375 --> 32:59.125
<i>this last stop on the road.</i>

33:08.250 --> 33:10.542
<i>Today I told your girl</i>
<i>there's</i>
<i>something bigger out there</i>

33:10.625 --> 33:12.792
<i>something better,</i>
<i>and she's gotta find it.</i>

33:23.750 --> 33:25.291
<i>Make sure she does</i>

33:25.375 --> 33:28.000
<i>'cause it's out there,</i>
<i>it's got to be out there.</i>

33:28.083 --> 33:30.208
<i>Don't lose her</i>
<i>like I lost my family.</i>

33:30.291 --> 33:32.500
<i>Like my boss fell out</i>
<i>with his daughter.</i>

33:32.583 --> 33:35.417
<i>Just up and ran away,</i>
<i>no idea where she went.</i>

33:41.583 --> 33:44.041
<i>She's gotta keep looking.</i>
<i>Me too.</i>

33:44.125 --> 33:45.959
(Jeffries)
"'Cause I know, one day,
we'll both find it.

33:47.417 --> 33:49.000
Signed, Andre Tibbs."

33:50.333 --> 33:52.709
So Andre's boss' daughter
split on him?

33:54.000 --> 33:55.417
Gotta be Wayne, right?

33:55.500 --> 33:57.583
Wayne, who goes around saying

33:57.667 --> 33:59.250
how close he and his kid are?

34:00.333 --> 34:02.291
(Danner)
What the hell is this?

34:02.375 --> 34:04.125
You jerk me
around for three
days

34:04.208 --> 34:05.542
when you knew
this was here?

34:05.625 --> 34:08.166
The Lange case is closed.

34:08.250 --> 34:10.000
You lie to my face.

34:10.083 --> 34:11.959
Let a man die.

34:12.041 --> 34:14.500
[chuckles]
And you're giving me a
tone?

34:14.583 --> 34:16.041
There is nothing there.

34:16.125 --> 34:17.125
Nothing.

34:17.208 --> 34:18.875
You're no better
than Norman.

34:20.208 --> 34:24.125
Kate's killer was executed
last night.

34:24.208 --> 34:26.625
Now, do I need to say it..

34:26.709 --> 34:27.792
...any..

34:27.875 --> 34:29.041
...slower?

34:30.000 --> 34:31.792
No.

34:31.875 --> 34:33.959
That's...just right.

34:39.542 --> 34:40.959
You're done.

34:41.041 --> 34:43.125
You're gonna be back in blues.

34:43.208 --> 34:45.041
You're gonna be riding
a mount for this.

34:49.125 --> 34:50.500
- 'Wayne Nelson's daughter..'
- 'Mm-hmm.'

34:50.583 --> 34:52.792
(Valens)
The one he claims
he's so close with?

34:52.875 --> 34:55.208
Turns out she booked out
12 years ago.

34:55.291 --> 34:56.709
No contact since.

34:56.792 --> 34:58.333
Not my definition of close.

34:58.417 --> 35:01.000
And guess what her name is?
Faith.

35:01.083 --> 35:04.750
faith
was saying right when she
died.

35:04.834 --> 35:07.875
- Maybe a coincidence.
- We track her down?

35:07.959 --> 35:09.709
Nah, Lil's talkin' to her now.

35:11.709 --> 35:14.333
I know this is hard
to talk about, Faith.

35:14.417 --> 35:16.125
It was 12 years
ago.
I'm okay.

35:17.709 --> 35:19.583
Uh, your dad's
under investigation

35:19.667 --> 35:21.417
for a young girl's death.

35:23.750 --> 35:24.875
Okay.

35:26.959 --> 35:28.500
And that doesn't surprise you?

35:30.208 --> 35:32.166
Not really.

35:32.250 --> 35:34.250
I know there's not
too many reasons

35:34.333 --> 35:37.125
a girl would walk out
on her dad and..

35:37.208 --> 35:38.625
...never look back.

35:40.542 --> 35:41.709
No.

35:43.125 --> 35:44.500
When did it start?

35:45.458 --> 35:46.667
When I was 13.

35:47.917 --> 35:49.333
I thought it was normal.

35:52.125 --> 35:54.125
Oh, how could you
know different?

35:54.208 --> 35:55.375
'But you learn.'

35:55.458 --> 35:57.333
Day after graduation,
I was gone.

35:57.417 --> 35:59.625
[sighs]
Heard from my friends

35:59.709 --> 36:02.625
he was calling them
20 times a day

36:02.709 --> 36:04.083
frantic to find me.

36:05.709 --> 36:07.959
- Did he?
- No.

36:08.041 --> 36:10.125
And then, one day,
he just..

36:10.208 --> 36:12.250
...stops calling.

36:12.333 --> 36:13.875
Never heard from him again.

36:13.959 --> 36:16.041
Y-you remember when that was?

36:16.125 --> 36:17.417
Never forgot.

36:17.500 --> 36:19.500
[sighs]
June '94.

36:21.291 --> 36:23.166
That's the same month
that Kate Lange was killed.

36:31.959 --> 36:34.583
(Danner)
You know what your detective
did to me this morning?

36:34.667 --> 36:35.959
It's going around.

36:36.041 --> 36:37.959
Well, I wanna know how
he's gonna be disciplined.

36:38.041 --> 36:40.166
Danner, he watched a man
die last night.

36:41.166 --> 36:42.458
Heat broke.

36:42.542 --> 36:44.291
Yeah, Andre was right.

36:47.542 --> 36:49.917
Got, uh, Wayne Nelson's
phone records.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.792
There was one outgoing call
made the night of Kate's
death.

36:52.875 --> 36:54.375
To the Lange house.

36:55.875 --> 36:57.375
Nelson's here now.

37:02.375 --> 37:03.625
Go do the interview.

37:08.041 --> 37:10.625
All I'm seeing here
is business as usual.

37:10.709 --> 37:12.750
I said I want that detective
punished.

37:12.834 --> 37:14.125
Yeah, I heard you.

37:14.208 --> 37:15.458
But this is our house

37:15.542 --> 37:17.458
and I said he's doing
the interview.

37:21.375 --> 37:23.333
Don't make me drop-kick you
out of here.

37:31.917 --> 37:34.458
So you said something
about, um, a
follow-up?

37:34.542 --> 37:36.709
Mmm. New developments.

37:37.917 --> 37:39.208
Like?

37:39.291 --> 37:40.875
Like, uh, you talking
on the phone

37:40.959 --> 37:43.208
with Kate Lange
the night she was murdered.

37:43.291 --> 37:46.208
- What?
- That's what I said.

37:46.291 --> 37:48.250
You're saying you didn't hear
Andre's pager, Wayne?

37:48.333 --> 37:50.125
The one he left behind.

37:50.208 --> 37:51.667
'You didn't make a call?'

37:51.750 --> 37:52.959
No. No, no, no.
You're right.

37:53.041 --> 37:55.000
Uh, but she was looking
for Andre.

37:55.083 --> 37:56.583
Good answer.

37:56.667 --> 37:58.375
'Cause we checked
with the phone company.

37:59.417 --> 38:00.667
Yeah, in fact, uh..

38:01.917 --> 38:04.667
[chuckles]
...it was funny because,
um..

38:04.750 --> 38:06.291
...at first, she
thought
I was Andre.

38:06.375 --> 38:08.458
- Mm-hmm.
- Recall how that went?

38:08.542 --> 38:11.291
Yeah, I called her back
and she was off and running

38:11.375 --> 38:12.709
saying she wanted to finish
our talk.

38:12.792 --> 38:14.959
Of course, uh,
I stopped her and..

38:15.041 --> 38:16.917
...set her straight
that it was me.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.625
Sure you didn't take advantage
of the mix-up?

38:19.709 --> 38:21.875
(Rush)
'Oh, for a guy like you..'

38:21.959 --> 38:23.875
...had to be an opportunity
of a lifetime.

38:25.291 --> 38:27.792
- A guy like me?
- We know about Faith.

38:27.875 --> 38:29.917
What you were doing to her
all those years.

38:31.291 --> 38:32.583
I don't like what
you're implying.

38:32.667 --> 38:35.041
I don't like it either, Wayne.

38:35.125 --> 38:36.625
In fact, it makes me sick.

38:37.583 --> 38:38.875
I know what you are.

38:38.959 --> 38:40.458
A degenerate like you
gets a chance

38:40.542 --> 38:43.375
to prey on a teenage girl
and it's only weeks

38:43.458 --> 38:45.125
after Faith walked out forever.

38:45.208 --> 38:46.625
Don't talk about Faith.

38:46.709 --> 38:48.041
I'll talk about her
all I want.

38:48.125 --> 38:49.291
By the way..

38:49.375 --> 38:51.208
...she hates your guts.

38:51.291 --> 38:54.166
(Jeffries)
'So, now, along comes,
uh, another young girl.'

38:54.250 --> 38:56.458
One who reminds you of Faith.

38:56.542 --> 38:58.667
You hear her voice on
the other line, late at night.

38:58.750 --> 39:01.750
Don't tell me you're not
going
over to get your jollies.

39:01.834 --> 39:03.834
(Jeffries)
'You were missing
your daughter.'

39:03.917 --> 39:06.291
Maybe you only meant to go
talk with this girl.

39:12.250 --> 39:14.959
She wasn't half as
sweet
as my Faith.

39:15.041 --> 39:17.875
'Cause she wasn't beaten down
by you.

39:17.959 --> 39:20.000
Probably told you to keep
your dirty hands off her.

39:20.083 --> 39:21.792
Oh, you got a sharp mouth.

39:23.959 --> 39:26.333
She talked back to me

39:26.417 --> 39:28.458
and fought me.

39:28.542 --> 39:30.542
Not like my good Faith at all.

40:15.625 --> 40:16.959
You shouldn't be calling
ex-cons.

40:19.083 --> 40:20.834
You're lucky
you got me and, uh..

40:22.500 --> 40:24.041
...not Andre.

40:24.125 --> 40:25.667
[gasps]
That was you on the phone?

40:27.291 --> 40:29.625
You don't call men

40:29.709 --> 40:31.000
in the middle of the night.

40:32.458 --> 40:35.250
'Cause you don't know
where a wrong mind can go.

40:38.917 --> 40:40.291
You understand, Faith?

40:42.083 --> 40:44.041
What did you call me?

40:44.125 --> 40:45.375
[whispers]
Come here.

40:45.458 --> 40:47.542
- My dad's coming down..
- Shh.

40:47.625 --> 40:48.917
...any minute now.

40:49.000 --> 40:50.166
No!

40:50.250 --> 40:52.333
That's enough, Faith.

40:52.417 --> 40:54.375
No, I'm not Faith.
Get out of my
house.

40:54.458 --> 40:55.792
Shh!

40:55.875 --> 40:57.500
Don't fight me.

40:57.583 --> 40:59.166
I'm not Faith.

40:59.250 --> 41:02.792
- I'm not Faith.
- Don't you talk back to me.

41:02.875 --> 41:05.291
You don't want me
to hurt you.

41:05.375 --> 41:07.583
You're always my nice girl.

41:08.750 --> 41:10.291
[whimpering]
No, please.
