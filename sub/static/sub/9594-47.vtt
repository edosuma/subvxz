WEBVTT

00:01.480 --> 00:02.470
Go!

00:40.020 --> 00:41.720
The great outdoors.

00:41.720 --> 00:42.780
What's so great about it?

00:42.780 --> 00:44.280
We're sleeping on rocks.

00:44.280 --> 00:45.370
Rocks!

00:45.370 --> 00:47.200
And all there is to
eat is beef jerky.

00:47.200 --> 00:48.090
Bleh!

00:48.090 --> 00:50.150
And there are no toilets.

00:50.150 --> 00:51.950
I am still the
confused as to why we

00:51.950 --> 00:53.750
are sleeping out of the doors.

00:53.750 --> 00:55.110
Is the tower broken?

00:55.110 --> 00:58.300
No, we are out here
because camping is fun!

00:58.300 --> 01:01.850
Hiking, making
s'mores, campfires--

01:01.850 --> 01:03.120
BEAST BOY: Mosquito bites.

01:03.120 --> 01:04.180
CYBORG: Wild animal attacks.

01:04.180 --> 01:05.340
STARFIRE: The body odours.

01:05.340 --> 01:06.780
Can we go home?

01:06.780 --> 01:08.770
No, you are having too much fun!

01:08.770 --> 01:10.320
-Fine.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.380
Let's just watch some TV.

01:11.380 --> 01:13.400
Where are you going
to plug in a TV?

01:13.400 --> 01:15.560
He's right.
I don't see any outlets.

01:15.560 --> 01:16.610
You mean...

01:16.610 --> 01:17.530
No TV?

01:19.290 --> 01:21.400
We don't need TV
to entertain us.

01:21.400 --> 01:25.480
That's what scary
campfire stories are for.

01:25.480 --> 01:26.420
Ah, that could be fun.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.190
-Sure.

01:28.190 --> 01:28.890
Why not?

01:28.890 --> 01:31.440
And you're going to do it and I
don't have to scream at anyone?

01:31.440 --> 01:33.370
It sounds the delightful.

01:34.150 --> 01:35.030
Keep it together, Robin.

01:35.030 --> 01:36.070
Don't blow this.

01:36.070 --> 01:37.690
For once, they're all excited.

01:37.690 --> 01:38.820
Hm, not me.

01:38.820 --> 01:39.930
I still want to go home.

01:39.930 --> 01:40.950
Three out of four.

01:40.950 --> 01:41.730
I'll take it.

01:41.730 --> 01:42.870
Who wants to go first?

01:42.870 --> 01:43.800
I do.

01:43.800 --> 01:45.110
I gots a super scary story.

01:45.110 --> 01:49.360
I just hope you all brought
a change of underpants.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.430
BEAST BOY : So there
was just this lumberjack dude

01:51.430 --> 01:53.540
who was lost in the
woods and all walking

01:53.540 --> 01:55.380
around in circles like a fool.

01:55.380 --> 01:57.430
He was like, man, I'm
crazy lost and walking

01:57.430 --> 01:59.380
around in circles like a fool.

01:59.380 --> 02:01.950
But then he found a cabin
and he was all like, cool.

02:01.950 --> 02:04.060
I'm gonna just chill in here.

02:04.060 --> 02:06.830
But what he didn't know was
that some other lumberjack

02:06.830 --> 02:08.800
dude said it was haunted.

02:08.800 --> 02:10.730
OTHER LUMBERJACK DUDE:
That place is so haunted.

02:11.680 --> 02:13.050
BEAST BOY :
So the lumberjack

02:13.050 --> 02:17.790
dude was all chilling when
he heard some creepy voice.

02:17.790 --> 02:19.170
CREEPY VOICE: I got
you where I want you.

02:19.170 --> 02:21.180
Now I'm gonna eat you.

02:21.180 --> 02:22.850
BEAST BOY :
The lumberjack dude, well,

02:22.850 --> 02:24.510
he's been around the
block a few times

02:24.510 --> 02:25.930
and isn't that scared by it.

02:25.930 --> 02:28.280
So he starts chilling again.

02:28.280 --> 02:31.460
But the creepy voice
started again, only louder.

02:31.460 --> 02:32.880
CREEPY VOICE: I got
you where I want you.

02:32.880 --> 02:35.680
Now I'm gonna eat you.

02:35.680 --> 02:36.980
BEAST BOY (VOICE
OVER): This lumberjack

02:36.980 --> 02:38.480
dude is getting creeped out.

02:38.480 --> 02:41.830
He's all like, I need to find
out where that creepy voice is

02:41.830 --> 02:43.490
coming from.

02:43.490 --> 02:44.880
CREEPY VOICE: I got
you where I want you.

02:44.880 --> 02:47.650
Now I'm gonna eat you.

02:47.650 --> 02:49.240
BEAST BOY (VOICE
OVER): He accidentally

02:49.240 --> 02:51.750
finds this secret hidden room.

02:51.750 --> 02:52.920
Crazy spooky.

02:52.920 --> 02:55.320
The lumberjack
dude was like, I'm

02:55.320 --> 02:57.920
gonna go into that
creepy hidden room, yo.

02:57.920 --> 03:01.040
It was completely
empty, except for

03:01.040 --> 03:03.270
this weird, spooky, tiny stage.

03:03.270 --> 03:07.470
He pulled the curtain back
and you know what he saw?

03:07.470 --> 03:10.370
A crazy, little monkey with
a booger on his finger,

03:10.370 --> 03:12.460
saying, I got you
where I want you.

03:12.460 --> 03:15.040
Now I'm gonna eat you.

03:16.970 --> 03:17.930
ALL: Ew!

03:17.930 --> 03:18.830
That was the disgusting.

03:18.830 --> 03:19.870
Ugh, really?

03:21.840 --> 03:23.700
Oh, I got you so good.

03:23.700 --> 03:25.850
You should see your faces.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.860
That's for telling a
story about a booger!

03:28.860 --> 03:30.590
Seriously, can we go home now?

03:30.590 --> 03:34.750
First, I wish to attempt the
telling of the spooky story.

03:34.750 --> 03:37.340
STARFIRE (VOICE
OVER): On a scary day,

03:37.340 --> 03:39.670
the friends were having
the good friend times

03:39.670 --> 03:42.780
and doing the
regular friend things

03:42.780 --> 03:46.950
until the spooky ghost
man came from his grave

03:46.950 --> 03:48.790
and scared everyone.

03:48.790 --> 03:52.080
SPOOKY GHOST MAN: I am
the spooky ghost man

03:52.080 --> 03:55.180
and I am haunting you!

03:58.160 --> 04:00.640
STARFIRE : The
friends narrowly escaped.

04:00.640 --> 04:03.410
The spooky ghost
man was very scary,

04:03.410 --> 04:06.750
but they were safe from his
hauntings in the bushy bush.

04:06.750 --> 04:11.880
They all breathed the breath
of relief until they realised

04:11.880 --> 04:15.010
the ghost had their ball.

04:15.010 --> 04:15.960
Dun.
Dun.

04:15.960 --> 04:17.140
Dun!
Pew!

04:17.140 --> 04:18.370
Pew!
Thunders.

04:18.370 --> 04:20.990
Thunders.
Lightnings.

04:20.990 --> 04:23.120
What should we do, they cried.

04:23.120 --> 04:27.600
If we do not have the ball,
we cannot play the catch.

04:29.100 --> 04:32.820
Then the spooky ghost
man returned and he said,

04:32.820 --> 04:36.080
I'm sorry I scared you.

04:36.080 --> 04:41.330
I am the socially awkward!

04:41.330 --> 04:44.150
He was very sorry
about scaring everyone

04:44.150 --> 04:45.940
and brought the
ball for the friends

04:45.940 --> 04:50.110
so they could all enjoy
playing the catch together.

04:50.110 --> 04:52.750
Oh, and there were
also two wolf mans.

04:52.750 --> 04:53.750
Woof!
Woof!

04:53.750 --> 04:55.770
Woof!

04:59.590 --> 05:03.110
It seems I have succeeded in
the telling of the spooky story.

05:03.110 --> 05:06.370
Nah, that's just Robin
getting mauled by a bear.

05:06.370 --> 05:07.870
The bear is eating me!

05:07.870 --> 05:09.860
He's eating me!
-Hm.

05:09.860 --> 05:11.060
He must have
smelled the s'mores.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.790
Help!

05:13.790 --> 05:15.890
Can't we just go home?

05:15.890 --> 05:19.090
Nope, because it's my
turn for a scary story.

05:21.920 --> 05:23.050
CYBORG (VOICE
OVER): I was out one

05:23.050 --> 05:25.680
night taking a relaxing night
drive, eating some peanuts.

05:25.680 --> 05:27.860
You know, got some of
that good music going.

05:27.860 --> 05:29.700
When suddenly, there's
a breaking news

05:29.700 --> 05:30.920
report on the radio.

05:30.920 --> 05:32.420
NEWS BROADCASTER: We
interrupt this broadcast

05:32.420 --> 05:34.570
to report an escaped mental
patient on the loose.

05:34.570 --> 05:36.400
He is dangerous and he
has a hook for a hand.

05:36.400 --> 05:39.270
Police recommend you stay inside
and lock all doors and windows.

05:39.270 --> 05:40.670
CYBORG :
So I'm eating my nuts

05:40.670 --> 05:41.980
and I hear this
report, you know.

05:41.980 --> 05:43.270
And I say, nuh-uh!

05:43.270 --> 05:44.950
And I flip my car
around and go home!

05:44.950 --> 05:46.770
I am not about to be
driving around at night when

05:46.770 --> 05:48.210
there's some crazy
pants hook-hand dude

05:48.210 --> 05:49.890
creeping around in the bushes.

05:49.890 --> 05:51.280
No way!

05:51.280 --> 05:53.920
So later that night,
I'm at home, you know.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.440
Door is locked,
eating some peanuts.

05:55.440 --> 05:56.930
Got some of that
good music going.

05:56.930 --> 05:57.770
And suddenly--

05:59.590 --> 06:00.400
So I pick it up.

06:00.400 --> 06:01.100
What up?

06:01.100 --> 06:01.900
What up?

06:01.900 --> 06:03.410
But there's no one on the line.

06:03.410 --> 06:06.460
So I listen closer and I hear--

06:06.460 --> 06:09.970
I hang up.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.430
And I think I should just
ignore this prank caller.

06:12.430 --> 06:13.700
Then I say, nuh-uh!

06:13.700 --> 06:15.930
And I call the police, demand
they come over to the tower

06:15.930 --> 06:16.850
and investigate.

06:16.850 --> 06:18.530
And it's a good thing I did.

06:18.530 --> 06:22.200
There was some creepy prowler
calling from inside the house!

06:22.200 --> 06:23.910
They arrested him, of course.

06:23.910 --> 06:25.010
I had to go to
the police station

06:25.010 --> 06:27.010
and ID him, testify against
him in a court of law.

06:27.010 --> 06:28.370
It was a whole process man.

06:28.370 --> 06:30.810
But the system worked
and he's going to be

06:30.810 --> 06:33.520
in gaol for a very long time.

06:33.520 --> 06:35.420
Point being, you can
never be too careful.

06:35.420 --> 06:36.940
There's a lot of
crazies out there.

06:36.940 --> 06:37.930
Woo, doggy.

06:37.930 --> 06:41.110
That wasn't scary
at all, Cyborg.

06:42.440 --> 06:44.060
That has given me the sleepies.

06:44.060 --> 06:46.040
-So disappointed, brah.

06:46.040 --> 06:48.450
I'm a very cautious person.

06:48.450 --> 06:49.930
OK, well then, time to go home.

06:49.930 --> 06:51.520
Don't you want to
hear my scary story?

06:51.520 --> 06:53.070
-Absolutely not.
-Great.

06:53.070 --> 06:57.580
And what makes my story extra
scary is that it's all true.

06:59.360 --> 07:02.150
ROBIN : It was
a dark and stormy night.

07:02.150 --> 07:06.130
And I forgot my umbrella,
so I got completely soaked.

07:06.130 --> 07:07.370
It was terrible!

07:07.370 --> 07:09.900
The hair I spent
hours on ruined!

07:09.900 --> 07:12.360
Normally, this would be
a big deal by itself,

07:12.360 --> 07:16.290
but tonight, I had a
date with a real girl.

07:16.290 --> 07:18.940
In your face everybody who
said it would never happen!

07:18.940 --> 07:19.870
Ha!

07:19.870 --> 07:21.730
I had purposely shown
up late because I didn't

07:21.730 --> 07:23.110
want to be the
first one to arrive,

07:23.110 --> 07:25.440
but there was no sign of her.

07:25.440 --> 07:27.700
I started to get nervous.

07:27.700 --> 07:30.310
Did I look like a loser
sitting there all alone?

07:30.310 --> 07:31.890
Did everyone
thinking I was eating

07:31.890 --> 07:33.990
yet another meal all by myself?

07:33.990 --> 07:35.160
So what if I like
to eat by myself?

07:35.160 --> 07:36.540
Robin, party of one?

07:36.540 --> 07:39.750
More like Robin, party of fun!

07:39.750 --> 07:43.030
With what felt like a million
beady eyes staring at me,

07:43.030 --> 07:44.300
I had to get out of there.

07:44.300 --> 07:48.230
I was starting to sweat,
so I tried to cool off.

07:48.230 --> 07:51.010
Instead, I splashed
water all over my pants.

07:51.010 --> 07:53.570
Everyone was going to think I
peed myself, but it was water!

07:53.570 --> 07:54.270
Just water.

07:54.270 --> 07:56.190
Sure, it looks like
pee, but it's not.

07:56.190 --> 07:56.990
It was water!

07:56.990 --> 07:57.950
I didn't pee myself.

07:57.950 --> 08:00.390
I haven't done that
in a very long time!

08:01.850 --> 08:04.640
I tried to stay calm,
but that's when I

08:04.640 --> 08:07.170
heard the scariest sound ever--

08:12.570 --> 08:14.230
It was my stomach.

08:14.230 --> 08:17.810
I decided to order and also,
eat the box of chocolates

08:17.810 --> 08:19.660
I brought for my date.

08:19.660 --> 08:23.850
She never came,
but the check did.

08:23.850 --> 08:25.930
I had assumed my date would
be paying for the meal,

08:25.930 --> 08:27.850
so I didn't bring my wallet.

08:27.850 --> 08:32.430
Not knowing what to do, I ran,
and ran, and ran, and ran,

08:32.430 --> 08:33.710
and never stopped running!

08:36.560 --> 08:38.840
And it's all true.

08:38.840 --> 08:41.560
You are a sad, little
man, aren't you?

08:41.560 --> 08:42.480
Yes, I am.

08:43.630 --> 08:45.670
Well, that was terrifying.

08:45.670 --> 08:47.180
Now can we go home?

08:47.180 --> 08:50.810
Not until you have told
the scary story, Raven.

08:50.810 --> 08:52.130
You want a scary story?

08:52.130 --> 08:53.630
Sure.

08:53.630 --> 08:55.800
RAVEN : Once upon
a time, a creature of darkness

08:55.800 --> 08:57.180
crawled into the world.

08:57.180 --> 09:02.080
The light her eye, so she
shut all but two of them.

09:02.080 --> 09:03.920
To hide herself from
the light, she wrapped

09:03.920 --> 09:05.610
herself in a cloak of darkness.

09:05.610 --> 09:07.870
The lady in the
cloak made friends--

09:07.870 --> 09:11.920
a man made of tin,
a princess, a hyena,

09:11.920 --> 09:15.180
and a tiny, tiny, little elf.

09:15.180 --> 09:16.830
Together they did noble deeds.

09:16.830 --> 09:19.910
And for a time, the lady in
the cloak lived as one of them.

09:19.910 --> 09:22.330
Over time, she grew weary.

09:22.330 --> 09:24.000
Boo-yah, yelled the tin man.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.240
Train, pay attention,
mandatory meetings,

09:26.240 --> 09:27.970
screeched the tiny,
tiny, little elf.

09:27.970 --> 09:29.950
The hyena laughed and laughed.

09:29.950 --> 09:32.900
And the princess,
well, she was cool.

09:32.900 --> 09:37.210
But every day, they grew
louder, and louder, and louder.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.980
Until one night, she snapped!

09:39.980 --> 09:43.230
Throwing aside her cloak, they
saw she was a monster that

09:43.230 --> 09:44.470
had been hiding among them.

09:44.470 --> 09:45.610
Her fingers became claws.

09:45.610 --> 09:47.080
Her teeth, razors.

09:47.080 --> 09:50.500
She opened all of
her hideous eyes.

09:50.500 --> 09:58.710
Then fast as a serpent,
she ate them one by one.

10:00.620 --> 10:02.880
What, uh-- what
happened to the monster?

10:02.880 --> 10:06.800
Nothing.
Because I'm the monster!

10:09.130 --> 10:10.050
Retreat to the tower!

10:10.050 --> 10:10.990
Retreat!

10:13.700 --> 10:15.610
So we're going home?

10:15.610 --> 10:17.640
Cool.

10:17.640 --> 10:20.060
Ah, I love campfire stories.
