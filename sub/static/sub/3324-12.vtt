00:01.961 --> 00:03.417
Previously on "Teen Wolf:"

00:03.588 --> 00:05.544
- So do you have the key or not?
- Not.

00:06.007 --> 00:07.872
Please, Allison, slop!

00:08.092 --> 00:09.468
I'm going tell you
how to slop Jackson.

00:09.635 --> 00:12.422
There is one young lady
with whom Jackson shared a real bond,

00:12.597 --> 00:14.087
one person who can save him.

00:14.307 --> 00:16.047
Somebody is hurt.
Somebody is down on the field.

00:16.225 --> 00:17.510
Jackson! Jackson!

00:18.269 --> 00:19.725
- He did ii to himself?
- Where's Stiles?

00:19.937 --> 00:21.393
Where the hell is my son?

00:33.618 --> 00:34.733
Thanks for your help.

00:34.911 --> 00:36.276
But we can fake it from here.

00:36.496 --> 00:38.612
You know,
I'm gonna have to give a statement.

00:38.789 --> 00:40.120
Why don't I ride with you?

00:40.333 --> 00:42.870
- Um, I think that would be a little...
- Perfect, great.

00:46.088 --> 00:47.248
Great.

00:50.259 --> 00:51.999
Ow...

00:53.304 --> 00:54.419
Ow.

02:00.580 --> 02:01.911
I gotta meet with the medical examiner

02:02.123 --> 02:03.704
and try to figure out
what happened with Jackson.

02:03.874 --> 02:05.865
I've got an APB out on Stiles.

02:06.294 --> 02:08.785
His jeep is still in the parking lot,
so that means...

02:12.675 --> 02:14.666
Hell, I don't know what that means.

02:17.638 --> 02:20.380
Look, if he answers his phone,
if he answers his emails,

02:20.600 --> 02:23.216
- if either one of you see him...
- We'll call you.

02:23.728 --> 02:27.141
Look, he's probablyjust freaked out
from all the attention or something.

02:27.356 --> 02:28.391
We'll find him.

02:30.568 --> 02:31.683
Yeah.

02:32.445 --> 02:34.060
I'll see you, okay?

02:36.824 --> 02:37.939
McCall.

02:38.743 --> 02:40.358
We need you on the team, okay?

02:40.578 --> 02:42.694
You know I can't put you
on the field next season

02:42.913 --> 02:44.494
if you don't get your grades up.

02:44.915 --> 02:47.122
- Yeah, I know, Coach.
- All right.

02:49.712 --> 02:54.672
I mean, I know I yell a lot,
but it's not like I hate you guys.

02:55.134 --> 02:58.126
I kind of hate Greenberg,
but, you know, that's different.

02:58.346 --> 02:59.335
It's Greenberg.

03:01.057 --> 03:03.423
I'm just saying we...

03:05.728 --> 03:07.218
I need you on the team.

03:07.438 --> 03:09.053
Get your grades back up.

03:09.273 --> 03:10.388
I will.

03:10.608 --> 03:11.768
I know.

03:14.654 --> 03:16.315
Is that everyone?

03:19.283 --> 03:20.443
I think so.

03:24.747 --> 03:27.910
- You're gonna find him by scent?
- Yeah, we both are.

03:29.293 --> 03:31.750
But how come you get his shirt
and | get a shoe?

03:34.632 --> 03:36.372
We need to talk.

03:38.427 --> 03:39.803
All of us.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.097
Holy sh...

03:44.558 --> 03:45.638
Ow!

03:46.227 --> 03:48.138
They were trying to warn you.

03:48.354 --> 03:49.969
It's electrified.

03:51.941 --> 03:53.647
What are you doing with them?

03:55.945 --> 03:58.982
At the moment,
just keeping them comfortable.

03:59.615 --> 04:02.277
There's no point in torturing them,
they won't give Derek up.

04:02.493 --> 04:05.200
The instinct to protect
their Alpha's too strong.

04:05.746 --> 04:06.906
Okay.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.871
So what are you doing with me?

04:10.751 --> 04:13.788
Because Scott can find me, all right?
He knows my scent.

04:14.004 --> 04:16.336
It's pungent, you know?
It's more like a stench.

04:16.549 --> 04:19.291
He could find me even if I was
buried at the bottom of a sewer

04:19.510 --> 04:21.171
covered in fecal matter and urine.

04:21.387 --> 04:25.300
You do have a knack for creating
a vivid picture, Mr. Stilinski.

04:25.516 --> 04:27.757
Let me paint one of my own.

04:29.061 --> 04:34.055
Scott McCall finds his best friend
bloodied and beaten to a pulp.

04:34.275 --> 04:35.685
How does that sound now?

04:36.277 --> 04:40.486
I think I might prefer more of
a still life or a landscape, you know?

04:43.951 --> 04:45.282
What are you, 90?

04:45.494 --> 04:47.871
Look, I can probably kick your ass
up and down this room.

04:50.750 --> 04:53.036
Okay. Wait, wait, wait.

04:53.878 --> 04:55.334
Okay, wait, wait.

05:04.764 --> 05:07.506
- What the hell is this?
- You know, I thought the same thing

05:07.725 --> 05:10.182
when I saw you talking
to Gerard at the sheriff's station.

05:10.394 --> 05:12.885
Okay, hold on.
He threatened to kill my mom.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.928
And I had to get close to him.
What was I supposed to do?

05:15.149 --> 05:18.107
I'm gonna go with Scott on this one.
Have you seen his mom?

05:18.319 --> 05:19.274
She's gorgeous.

05:19.487 --> 05:20.442
- Shut up.
- Shut up.

05:21.614 --> 05:22.478
Who is he?

05:22.990 --> 05:25.948
He's Peter, Derek's uncle.
Little while back, he tried to kill us all,

05:26.160 --> 05:28.446
and then we set him on fire,
and Derek slashed his throat.

05:30.581 --> 05:31.661
That's good to know.

05:31.832 --> 05:32.787
How is he alive?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.616
Look, the short version is
he knows how to stop Jackson.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.121
And maybe how to save him.

05:37.338 --> 05:40.000
Well, that's very helpful,
except Jackson's dead.

05:41.217 --> 05:42.206
What?

05:42.426 --> 05:44.633
Yeah, Jackson's dead.
ltjust happened on the field.

05:46.180 --> 05:48.216
Okay, why is no one
taking this as good news?

05:48.432 --> 05:52.266
Because if Jackson is dead,
it didn't just happen.

05:52.478 --> 05:54.184
Gerard wanted it to happen.

05:54.438 --> 05:55.598
But why?

05:56.565 --> 05:59.272
Well, that's exactly
what we need to figure out.

05:59.819 --> 06:03.403
And something tells me
the window of opportunity is closing.

06:03.614 --> 06:04.820
Quickly.

06:12.915 --> 06:13.995
I saw the lights flicker.

06:14.208 --> 06:18.121
Probably just one of our guests
getting comfortable downstairs.

06:19.505 --> 06:21.336
Get some sleep it you can.

06:21.549 --> 06:25.337
l have a feeling the next
24 hours are going to be eventful.

06:29.807 --> 06:32.423
You gonna tell me
what happened at the game?

06:33.644 --> 06:35.225
Didn't you hear?

06:36.313 --> 06:37.564
We won.

06:39.233 --> 06:40.848
I meant Jackson.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.191
So did I.

06:57.668 --> 06:59.249
You need something?

07:00.379 --> 07:02.335
I want you to step aside
and let us handle this.

07:02.548 --> 07:04.379
- You're kidding, right?
- One of your friends is dead.

07:04.592 --> 07:05.672
Because of Derek.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.550
How do you think Jackson became
that thing in the first place?

07:08.762 --> 07:11.344
Kate, Mom, Jackson.

07:11.557 --> 07:14.515
What about Scott?
What if he dies too?

07:17.271 --> 07:18.852
Since when did you care about Scott?

07:19.899 --> 07:21.890
I care about you.

07:22.109 --> 07:25.442
Really, Dad.
If you're going to start quoting

07:25.654 --> 07:28.361
from the list of the top five things
a parent should say to their child every day,

07:28.574 --> 07:30.485
why don't you start with,

07:30.701 --> 07:34.614
"I'm proud of you," because I am
doing exactly what you wanted.

07:36.415 --> 07:37.951
No, Allison.

07:39.001 --> 07:41.492
You're doing exactly what he wants.

07:42.713 --> 07:43.828
We all are.

07:44.715 --> 07:47.582
I'm tired.
I just really want to pass out, okay?

07:49.428 --> 07:50.508
Fine.

07:50.721 --> 07:53.337
By the way,
don't forget you owe me a new bow.

07:56.185 --> 07:57.971
And a new crossbow.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.308
Oh, God, are we gonna do this?

08:49.780 --> 08:51.736
Yeah, we're gonna do this, okay.

09:05.546 --> 09:07.912
Yeah, I'm not finding any clues here.

09:08.298 --> 09:10.038
Listen, if he...

09:10.634 --> 09:13.046
If he shows up at the hospital...

09:14.805 --> 09:16.261
Okay, thanks.

09:19.393 --> 09:20.508
Come on, Stiles.

09:20.686 --> 09:22.893
- Where the hell are you?
- Right here.

09:26.108 --> 09:28.269
It's okay.
Dad, it's okay.

09:28.485 --> 09:29.520
Who did it?

09:30.446 --> 09:32.687
It's okay. It was just a couple
kids from the other team.

09:32.906 --> 09:36.034
They were pissed about losing
and l was mouthing off.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.744
- The next thing I know...
- Who was it?

09:37.953 --> 09:39.568
Dad, I don't know.
I didn't even see them, really.

09:39.788 --> 09:41.039
I want descriptions.

09:41.206 --> 09:43.868
- Dad, come on. It's not even that bad.
- I'm calling that school.

09:44.043 --> 09:45.749
I'm calling them
and I'll personally go down there,

09:45.961 --> 09:47.417
and I'm gonna pistol-whip
these little bastards!

09:47.629 --> 09:49.210
Dad! ljust...

09:49.590 --> 09:51.376
I said I was okay.

09:53.177 --> 09:54.212
God.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.850
Oh, they found Stiles.

10:04.063 --> 10:07.100
- Look, I told you, I looked everywhere.
- You didn't look here.

10:17.618 --> 10:19.358
What is that, a book?

10:19.578 --> 10:22.695
No. It's a laptop.
What century are you living in?

10:23.165 --> 10:26.498
A few days after I got out of the coma,
I transferred everything that we had.

10:26.710 --> 10:29.201
Fortunately, the Argents
aren't the only ones that keep records.

10:32.674 --> 10:33.880
Hey, Mom, I can't talk right now.

10:34.093 --> 10:36.209
Yeah? Well, I'm so freaked out
that I can barely talk either.

10:36.428 --> 10:38.293
- What's wrong?
- Something. Definitely something.

10:38.514 --> 10:41.597
I don't know what, but I think you're gonna
want to see this for yourself.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.898
Dad, I said I'm fine.

11:02.121 --> 11:04.407
Come on, Dad.
How many times...

11:10.170 --> 11:11.785
Your father let me in.

11:12.005 --> 11:12.960
He did?

11:13.632 --> 11:16.339
- Yeah, of course he did.
- What happened to your...

11:16.927 --> 11:19.760
Oh, uh...
Yeah, no, it's nothing.

11:19.972 --> 11:22.384
Don't worry about it. I'm fine.

11:25.394 --> 11:27.476
Do you want to come in? Maybe...

11:35.737 --> 11:37.238
How you doing?

11:39.700 --> 11:41.656
They won't let me see him.

11:45.622 --> 11:47.999
I'm supposed to give him something.

11:49.418 --> 11:51.830
He kept asking for it back.

11:57.301 --> 11:58.461
What's happening to him?

11:58.635 --> 12:00.842
I thought that you were gonna tell me.
Is it bad?

12:01.054 --> 12:02.555
It doesn't look good.

12:02.764 --> 12:04.595
Whoa. Whoa.

12:05.851 --> 12:07.557
Mom, could you zip it up, please?

12:10.147 --> 12:11.262
Okay.

12:11.899 --> 12:14.265
Okay, okay. Okay, here we go.

12:22.743 --> 12:23.983
Mom, zip.

12:24.203 --> 12:25.613
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

12:25.829 --> 12:27.410
Zip! Zip, Mom, zip!

12:27.623 --> 12:28.703
Zip!

12:34.129 --> 12:36.336
You know,
my family's done this for a long time.

12:36.548 --> 12:37.833
Long enough to learn things,

12:38.050 --> 12:41.417
like how a certain level of electric current
can keep you from transforming.

12:43.347 --> 12:45.133
At another level, you can't heal.

12:45.349 --> 12:47.465
A few amps higher,
and no heightened strength.

12:47.643 --> 12:49.804
That kind of scientific accuracy,
it makes you wonder

12:50.020 --> 12:54.434
where the line between the natural
and the supernatural really exists.

13:02.824 --> 13:04.815
It's when lines like that blur...

13:07.120 --> 13:10.704
You sometimes find yourself
surprised by which side you end up on.

13:28.558 --> 13:31.595
Hey, sorry,
I didn't have any tissues, so...

13:32.771 --> 13:33.851
That's fine.

13:35.399 --> 13:37.230
God, I'm such a mess.

13:39.403 --> 13:40.643
God.

13:40.862 --> 13:43.729
You have 17 missed messages from Scott.

13:43.949 --> 13:45.029
I know.

13:46.076 --> 13:49.989
- You're ignoring him?
- No. No, not really.

13:59.047 --> 14:00.878
Why do you have women's jewelry?

14:01.091 --> 14:02.456
Oh!

14:03.969 --> 14:09.384
Uh, nothing, it'sjust some stuff I bought,
you know, for your birthday.

14:11.852 --> 14:13.262
- For me?
- Yeah, ljust...

14:13.478 --> 14:17.141
I kind of didn't know what to get you,
so ljust bought you, like, a bunch of stuff.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.597
Like, a lot of stuff.

14:18.817 --> 14:21.308
You know, I was gonna
return anything that I didn't give you.

14:28.118 --> 14:29.324
A flat-screen TV?

14:30.454 --> 14:32.319
Yeah, that I'm definitely returning.

14:40.756 --> 14:42.621
You're gonna want to read this.

14:45.052 --> 14:47.259
They say he's in
some kind of transparent casing

14:47.429 --> 14:49.511
made from the venom
coming out of his claws.

14:50.390 --> 14:53.006
That sounds officially terrifying.

14:53.852 --> 14:55.513
They also say he's starting to move.

14:55.729 --> 14:57.720
Okay, look, I think I found something.

14:57.939 --> 15:01.807
Looks like what you're seeing from Jackson
is just the Kanima's beta shape.

15:02.361 --> 15:04.727
Well, meaning what?
He can turn into something bigger?

15:07.115 --> 15:09.322
Bigger and badder.

15:09.493 --> 15:12.200
He's turning into that?
That has wings.

15:13.330 --> 15:15.036
I can see that.

15:16.750 --> 15:19.958
- Scott, bring him to us.
- I'm not sure if we have time for that.

15:23.215 --> 15:25.001
Look, somebody actually
made an animation of it.

15:25.217 --> 15:26.707
Maybe it's less frightening if we...

15:28.678 --> 15:30.714
Nope, not at all.
We should probably meet them halfway.

15:30.931 --> 15:33.422
Scott, get him out of there now.
Go now.

15:39.856 --> 15:41.812
Wake up, sweetheart.

15:42.025 --> 15:43.481
It's starting.

15:46.113 --> 15:47.068
Hold on!

15:50.158 --> 15:51.694
Okay, go. Go, go, go, go, go.

16:18.478 --> 16:21.060
- Derek, we need Lydia.
- Look, there's no time for...

16:21.815 --> 16:24.898
That's the problem. We're rushing.
We're moving too fast.

16:25.110 --> 16:27.726
And while everybody knows
that a moving target is harder to hit,

16:27.946 --> 16:30.813
here we are,
racing right into Gerard's crosshairs.

16:31.575 --> 16:34.442
If I get the chance to kill Jackson,
I'm taking it.

16:37.205 --> 16:38.285
You're alone.

16:40.125 --> 16:41.865
More than you know.

16:42.752 --> 16:43.878
What do you want?

16:47.716 --> 16:50.207
We don't have much in common, Scott.

16:50.927 --> 16:53.760
But at the moment,
we have a common enemy.

16:54.264 --> 16:56.425
That's why I'm trying to
get him out of here.

16:56.892 --> 16:58.848
I didn't mean Jackson.

16:59.811 --> 17:01.847
How much do you know
about this stuff?

17:02.439 --> 17:03.770
Pieces.

17:04.274 --> 17:05.730
Half of it's like a dream.

17:05.942 --> 17:08.058
Yeah, well, guess what?
The other half is like a freaking nightmare.

17:08.236 --> 17:10.272
I don't care. I can help him.

17:11.490 --> 17:13.481
See, that's the problem.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.941
You don't care about getting hurt.

17:16.161 --> 17:18.527
But you know how I'll feel?
I'll be devastated.

17:18.872 --> 17:22.114
And if you die,
I will literally go out of my freakin' mind.

17:23.335 --> 17:25.041
You see,
death doesn't happen to you, Lydia.

17:25.212 --> 17:26.748
It happens to everyone
around you, okay?

17:26.922 --> 17:28.913
To all the people left
standing at your funeral,

17:29.132 --> 17:32.124
trying to figure out how they're gonna live
the rest of their lives now without you in it?

17:32.344 --> 17:34.630
Huh?
And look at my face!

17:34.846 --> 17:36.962
Come on, you actually
think this was meant to hurt me?

17:45.649 --> 17:47.059
I'm so sorry.

17:48.610 --> 17:49.895
It's okay.

17:52.030 --> 17:54.692
- I'll find him myself.
- Hey, Lydia, wait.

17:55.784 --> 17:57.945
Gerard has twisted his way
into Allison's head

17:58.161 --> 18:00.197
in the same way he did with Kate.

18:00.413 --> 18:04.031
And I'm losing her.
And I know you're losing her too.

18:05.335 --> 18:06.415
You're right.

18:09.548 --> 18:11.664
So can you trust me to fix this?

18:16.888 --> 18:18.264
Then can you let us go?

18:20.767 --> 18:21.882
No.

18:24.604 --> 18:25.764
My car's faster.

18:36.032 --> 18:37.693
She left, huh?

18:38.410 --> 18:39.650
Yeah.

18:41.329 --> 18:43.115
So, was there...

18:45.584 --> 18:46.539
Anything there?

18:47.460 --> 18:48.540
No.

18:48.962 --> 18:51.203
No, she's in love
with someone else.

18:53.008 --> 18:53.963
Ah.

19:02.601 --> 19:03.807
Listen.

19:05.270 --> 19:09.889
I know that getting beaten up,
and with what happened to Jackson,

19:10.108 --> 19:11.644
has gotten you pretty shaken.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.567
But be happy about one thing.

19:17.616 --> 19:18.776
The game.

19:20.910 --> 19:22.616
You were amazing.

19:23.872 --> 19:25.362
Thanks, Dad.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.572
No, I mean it.

19:28.793 --> 19:31.626
Look, it was pretty much over.

19:33.465 --> 19:36.423
And then you got the ball
and you started running.

19:36.635 --> 19:39.468
You scored,
and the tide just turned.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.295
And you scored again.

19:43.642 --> 19:45.052
And again.

19:46.603 --> 19:48.889
You weren'tjust the MVP of the game.

19:50.231 --> 19:51.641
You were a hero.

19:55.195 --> 19:57.060
No, I'm not a hero, Dad.

19:58.114 --> 19:59.854
You were last night.

20:05.955 --> 20:07.911
I'm not a hero.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.882
I think he stopped moving.

20:31.981 --> 20:32.970
Where's Derek?

20:47.580 --> 20:50.322
Someone certainly enjoys
making an entrance.

20:53.670 --> 20:55.160
I'm here for Jackson.

20:55.463 --> 20:56.578
Not you.

20:57.132 --> 20:59.293
Somehow, I don't
find that very comforting.

21:01.761 --> 21:02.750
Get him inside.

21:12.647 --> 21:13.887
Where are they?

21:15.608 --> 21:17.599
- Who?
- Peter and Lydia.

21:24.075 --> 21:26.452
Okay, whoa.
Hold on a second.

21:26.661 --> 21:28.652
- You said you knew how to save him.
- We're past that.

21:28.872 --> 21:31.033
- What about...
- Think about it, Scott.

21:31.249 --> 21:33.160
Gerard controls him now.

21:33.376 --> 21:35.913
He's turned Jackson
into his own personal guard dog.

21:36.129 --> 21:37.539
And he set all of this in motion

21:37.756 --> 21:40.668
so that Jackson
could get even bigger and more powerful.

21:40.884 --> 21:42.044
No.

21:42.761 --> 21:44.251
No, he wouldn't do that.

21:44.679 --> 21:47.216
If Jackson's a dog,
he's turning rabid,

21:47.807 --> 21:50.014
and my father
wouldn't let a rabid dog live.

21:50.185 --> 21:51.140
Of course not.

21:54.355 --> 21:57.518
Anything that dangerous,
that out of control,

21:59.194 --> 22:00.684
is better off dead.

22:22.842 --> 22:25.379
Well done to the last, Scott.

22:28.306 --> 22:33.346
Like the concerned friend you are,
you brought Jackson to Derek to save him.

22:33.561 --> 22:38.726
You just didn't realize
that you were also bringing Derek to me.

22:43.905 --> 22:44.985
Allison?

22:46.825 --> 22:47.780
Come on!

24:32.931 --> 24:34.922
No, Allison!

24:38.645 --> 24:40.226
Not yet, sweetheart.

24:43.858 --> 24:44.847
What are you doing?

24:47.654 --> 24:49.690
He's doing
what he came here to do.

24:50.323 --> 24:52.939
- Then you know?
- What is he talking about?

24:57.205 --> 25:01.073
It was the night outside the hospital,
wasn't it, when l threatened your mother.

25:01.292 --> 25:05.956
I knew I saw something in your eyes.
You could just smell it, couldn't you?

25:06.631 --> 25:07.746
He's dying.

25:08.424 --> 25:09.539
lam.

25:09.759 --> 25:11.715
l have been for a while now.

25:11.928 --> 25:16.297
Unfortunately, science doesn't
have a cure for cancer yet.

25:16.975 --> 25:19.216
But the supernatural does.

25:25.775 --> 25:27.265
You monster.

25:27.485 --> 25:28.440
Not yet.

25:28.653 --> 25:30.268
What are you doing?

25:31.239 --> 25:32.945
You'll kill her, too?

25:33.616 --> 25:38.280
When it comes to survival,
I'd kill my own son!

25:47.088 --> 25:48.328
Scott.

26:33.968 --> 26:35.549
Scott, don't.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.212
You know that he's
gonna kill me right after.

26:39.432 --> 26:41.718
- He'll be an Alpha.
- That's true.

26:42.268 --> 26:45.180
But I think he already knows that,
don't you, Scott?

26:45.646 --> 26:48.934
He knows that the
ultimate prize is Allison.

26:50.026 --> 26:53.234
Do this small task for me,
and they can be together.

26:53.446 --> 26:57.064
You are the only piece
that doesn't fit, Derek.

26:57.283 --> 27:04.280
And in case you haven't learned yet,
there is just no competing with young love.

27:04.499 --> 27:05.705
Scott, don't!

27:07.085 --> 27:08.996
- Don't!
- I'm sorry.

27:09.670 --> 27:11.046
But I have to.

27:43.121 --> 27:44.657
What the...

27:55.299 --> 27:56.414
What?

28:00.930 --> 28:02.761
What is this?

28:03.891 --> 28:06.268
What did you do?

28:08.896 --> 28:11.228
Everyone said Gerard
always had a plan.

28:15.444 --> 28:16.820
I had a plan, too.

28:23.369 --> 28:25.951
No. No.

28:28.124 --> 28:29.034
You dropped this.

28:42.346 --> 28:44.837
Mountain ash!

29:21.302 --> 29:22.712
Why didn't you tell me?

29:25.056 --> 29:26.421
Because you might be an Alpha,

29:27.475 --> 29:28.635
but you're not mine.

29:44.283 --> 29:45.238
Kill them!

29:47.119 --> 29:51.328
Kill them all!

30:10.977 --> 30:11.932
Did I get him?

30:16.732 --> 30:17.983
Whoa!

30:23.239 --> 30:24.194
Jackson!

30:25.908 --> 30:27.489
- Jackson.
- Lydia!

30:49.098 --> 30:50.178
Here.

30:50.766 --> 30:52.347
It's to the front door.

30:53.185 --> 30:55.050
A key to your house?

30:55.688 --> 30:56.928
Already?

30:57.315 --> 30:59.556
Well, it's not a wedding ring.

31:01.527 --> 31:05.019
So you're just making me
a more accessible late-night booty call.

31:05.614 --> 31:06.899
Late night...

31:07.116 --> 31:09.949
Late afternoon, late morning.

32:41.627 --> 32:42.707
Do you...

32:44.505 --> 32:46.541
- Do you still?
- I do.

32:51.595 --> 32:53.256
I do still love you.

32:54.140 --> 32:56.677
I do, I do still love you. I do.

33:28.966 --> 33:29.921
Where's Gerard?

33:30.885 --> 33:31.874
He can't be far.

35:29.503 --> 35:31.289
He scratched my jeep.

35:37.011 --> 35:38.547
I'm sorry.

35:38.846 --> 35:40.632
You don't have to say you're sorry.

35:40.848 --> 35:41.963
I do.

35:42.433 --> 35:43.639
I have to.

35:44.435 --> 35:46.426
For what I did and what I said.

35:47.563 --> 35:48.894
For everything.

35:49.982 --> 35:52.018
Especially for what I have to do now.

35:52.651 --> 35:53.891
It's okay.

35:54.236 --> 35:56.613
- No, it's not.
- It is.

35:56.947 --> 35:58.812
Scott, I'm trying to
break up with you.

35:59.783 --> 36:00.898
I know.

36:02.328 --> 36:03.568
And it's okay.

36:04.955 --> 36:06.661
How is that okay?

36:08.000 --> 36:09.536
Because I can wait.

36:10.544 --> 36:13.877
I can't make you wait for me.
I'm not going to do that.

36:14.089 --> 36:17.252
You don't have to
because I know we're gonna be together.

36:19.845 --> 36:21.756
There's no such thing as fate.

36:23.849 --> 36:25.805
There's no such thing as werewolves.

37:26.495 --> 37:27.780
- No, wait!
- What?

37:29.289 --> 37:30.665
Are you okay?

37:30.874 --> 37:32.705
Yeah, I just need to...

37:34.002 --> 37:35.287
Catch my breath.

38:10.622 --> 38:13.580
You're not planning on
getting your hands dirty, are you?

38:16.295 --> 38:17.501
I do what I have to.

38:17.880 --> 38:21.623
Good. I never liked
you being retired anyway.

38:22.342 --> 38:24.128
Whoever said I was retired?

38:32.102 --> 38:35.640
You haven't told him
everything yet, have you?

38:37.816 --> 38:39.431
What do you mean?

38:41.028 --> 38:43.690
Why do you think Derek was in
such a hurry to build his pack?

38:44.031 --> 38:46.943
So eager to strengthen
his power and his number?

38:47.159 --> 38:49.024
When there's a new Alpha,
people take notice.

38:49.244 --> 38:50.700
People like who?

38:52.498 --> 38:53.783
What is this?

38:54.333 --> 38:56.415
- What does this mean?
- It's their symbol.

38:56.627 --> 38:58.208
- And it means they're coming.
- Who?

38:58.378 --> 38:59.367
Alphas.

39:00.088 --> 39:01.123
More than one?

39:02.132 --> 39:03.372
A pack of them.

39:03.759 --> 39:06.592
An Alpha pack.
And they're not coming.

39:08.096 --> 39:09.802
They're already here.

39:44.091 --> 39:46.707
So you really think
she's gonna come back to you?

39:47.177 --> 39:48.792
Yeah, I know she is.

39:49.596 --> 39:50.756
What about you and Lydia?

39:50.931 --> 39:53.968
Ugh. Well, the 10-year plan
for making Lydia fall in love with me

39:54.184 --> 39:58.518
may have to stretch to 15,
but the plan is definitely still in motion.

40:01.441 --> 40:02.601
Why don't you just ask her out?

40:03.652 --> 40:05.643
Yeah,okay.
Why don't you just get in the goal

40:05.821 --> 40:08.563
and help me make team captain
like you promised there, big guy?

40:12.286 --> 40:14.197
You know what I just realized?

40:14.997 --> 40:17.329
- I'm right back where I started.
- What do you mean?

40:17.541 --> 40:21.580
I mean, no lacrosse,
no popularity, no girlfriend. Nothing.

40:22.546 --> 40:24.036
Dude, you still got me.

40:25.215 --> 40:27.831
- I had you before.
- Yeah, and you still got me.

40:28.552 --> 40:30.508
Okay? It's a life fulfilled.

40:31.013 --> 40:32.253
Very.

40:32.556 --> 40:34.922
Now remember, no wolf powers.

40:35.559 --> 40:37.766
- Got it.
- No, I mean it.

40:37.978 --> 40:43.223
No super fast reflexes, no super eyesight,
no hearing. None of that crap, okay?

40:43.567 --> 40:44.522
Okay.

40:45.360 --> 40:46.440
Come on.

40:50.657 --> 40:53.569
- You promise?
- Would you just take the shot already?

41:07.174 --> 41:08.960
I said no wolf powers!
