00:00.053 --> 00:01.563
Previously on "Timeless"...

00:01.565 --> 00:04.492
After Jessica died I
stopped caring. Not anymore.

00:06.725 --> 00:09.187
Jessica? You're actually here.

00:09.190 --> 00:10.890
- Jessica's alive.
- How is that possible?

00:10.893 --> 00:12.729
- I'm so sorry.
- Wyatt, I'm thrilled for you.

00:12.731 --> 00:14.264
- But you and me...
- She's your wife,

00:14.266 --> 00:15.698
- and you love her.
- And then you disappeared

00:15.700 --> 00:17.167
for two months without saying anything?

00:17.169 --> 00:19.067
You're putting me on this pedestal.

00:19.070 --> 00:20.069
I'm not that person.

00:20.071 --> 00:21.671
She's a witch.

00:21.673 --> 00:23.339
Lucy!

00:24.743 --> 00:26.042
- Lucy, your arm.
- I'll be fine.

00:32.717 --> 00:34.551
You failed 'cause your
daughter, who you should have

00:34.553 --> 00:36.386
let me kill in 1818, is still out there.

00:36.389 --> 00:37.888
I'm taking you off the Lucy assignment.

00:37.890 --> 00:39.222
That's not necessary.

00:39.224 --> 00:40.891
She's our problem now.

00:41.893 --> 00:44.606
_

00:44.609 --> 00:47.096
_

00:49.234 --> 00:51.768
Quite a ruckus in the dorm last night.

00:51.770 --> 00:54.504
I'm not sure what you're
talking about, Lem.

00:54.506 --> 00:56.105
The fire alarm? Oh, come on.

00:56.107 --> 00:57.776
Five bucks says that
was you sneaking out

00:57.779 --> 00:59.108
with a girl from Miss Porter's.

00:59.110 --> 01:01.546
If it was, and I'm saying
it'd be a vicious lie,

01:01.549 --> 01:03.315
there's not a soul who can prove it.

01:03.318 --> 01:06.015
Ah, Jack. A moment,
please, in my office.

01:06.017 --> 01:08.017
Yes, sir.

01:08.019 --> 01:09.886
What else did you do, Jack?

01:09.888 --> 01:11.421
I honestly don't know,

01:11.423 --> 01:13.890
but I'm about to find out.

01:13.892 --> 01:17.513
Muckers Club meeting
tonight. Don't be late.

01:19.063 --> 01:20.596
You wanted to see me, sir.

01:20.599 --> 01:23.801
Come in, Jack, and
close the door, will you?

01:25.000 --> 01:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:48.226 --> 01:51.094
Hey. You're awake.

01:51.096 --> 01:52.930
Fever dropped. That's a good sign.

01:54.733 --> 01:56.165
Wyatt?

01:56.167 --> 01:57.501
He's on a mission.

01:59.137 --> 02:00.837
He went without me?

02:00.839 --> 02:04.774
You were stabbed with a knife
full of 17th-century germs

02:04.776 --> 02:08.176
and running a fever of 105, remember?

02:08.179 --> 02:10.780
Ow. I don't care.

02:10.782 --> 02:12.415
He shouldn't have gone without me.

02:12.417 --> 02:13.983
Flynn's pinch hitting.

02:13.985 --> 02:16.119
I'm sure he and Wyatt have
everything under control.

02:16.121 --> 02:18.154
Sure. What could go wrong?

02:18.157 --> 02:19.589
Would've been weird anyway, right?

02:19.599 --> 02:22.185
You and Wyatt on a trip?

02:23.461 --> 02:25.762
Rufus told me. About Hollywood.

02:25.764 --> 02:28.765
You, Wyatt. Sounded pretty romantic.

02:28.767 --> 02:30.833
I didn't know that he was still married.

02:30.835 --> 02:32.802
I mean...

02:32.804 --> 02:34.404
I didn't know that Jessica was...

02:34.406 --> 02:36.440
Alive again. I know.

02:37.542 --> 02:39.475
Wasn't judging.

02:40.879 --> 02:42.279
I just...

02:43.782 --> 02:46.015
I just mean it must be hard.

02:46.017 --> 02:48.084
Especially with her here.

02:48.086 --> 02:49.485
I want him to be happy.

02:49.487 --> 02:51.688
I mean, this is what he's always wanted.

02:51.690 --> 02:53.823
- So...
- What about what you want?

02:53.825 --> 02:57.093
We're still friends.
Mm, we have the missions.

02:57.095 --> 02:58.428
I'll be fine.

02:58.430 --> 03:00.029
Hey, whoa, whoa, okay.

03:00.031 --> 03:01.667
- I'll be fine, I'll be fine.
- Take it easy.

03:01.669 --> 03:03.766
- Don't be a hero today.
- No heroics.

03:03.768 --> 03:05.435
I'm just gonna get some tea.

03:12.243 --> 03:13.543
Oh, hey.

03:13.545 --> 03:15.812
- Hey.
- Lucy, right?

03:15.814 --> 03:17.627
- How you feeling?
- Not that great, actually.

03:17.630 --> 03:19.323
I think I'm gonna go
back to bed and rest.

03:19.326 --> 03:20.693
Do you want some tea?

03:22.253 --> 03:23.320
Sit down.

03:24.522 --> 03:27.190
I tend bar for a living, so
it's like physically impossible

03:27.192 --> 03:29.326
for me to let someone
else serve their own drink.

03:30.594 --> 03:32.594
So you're a historian, right?

03:32.597 --> 03:35.465
- Mm-hmm.
- That must be interesting.

03:37.569 --> 03:39.235
Don't know why I said that.

03:39.237 --> 03:41.738
I have no idea what a historian does.

03:41.740 --> 03:43.573
Hmm.

03:45.510 --> 03:48.745
Yeah, well, um, I teach.

03:48.747 --> 03:52.849
I taught... I mean I used to,
you know, before all of this.

03:52.851 --> 03:54.517
Well, Wyatt said he wouldn't survive

03:54.519 --> 03:56.085
the missions without you.

03:56.088 --> 03:58.779
No, it's really more
the other way around.

04:00.391 --> 04:02.369
You, um... you said you're a bartender?

04:02.372 --> 04:05.061
Yeah, yeah, yeah. At
Gilroy's in the Mission.

04:05.063 --> 04:06.863
Drinks suck, but the management's cool.

04:06.865 --> 04:08.635
Uh, is that where you and Wyatt met?

04:08.638 --> 04:10.967
No, Wyatt and I met in high school.

04:10.969 --> 04:12.368
Yeah.

04:12.370 --> 04:14.303
We've been together since senior year

04:14.305 --> 04:16.606
if you can believe that.
He didn't tell you this?

04:16.608 --> 04:18.173
Yeah, he's not much of a talker.

04:18.176 --> 04:20.442
What about you? Are you married?

04:20.445 --> 04:22.311
No.

04:22.313 --> 04:25.581
Me... not married.

04:25.583 --> 04:29.619
I mean, I, uh... I was
engaged once, kind of.

04:29.621 --> 04:31.254
For like a moment. I don't know. It's...

04:31.256 --> 04:33.122
It's complicated.

04:33.124 --> 04:36.058
It always is, isn't it?

04:36.060 --> 04:38.861
Wyatt and I have been in
counseling for two years.

04:38.863 --> 04:40.563
I mean in my reality.

04:40.565 --> 04:43.132
I guess not in his.

04:43.134 --> 04:46.536
Or yours. It's, uh...

04:46.538 --> 04:49.338
This time travel stuff
really messes with your head.

05:05.256 --> 05:07.557
- What happened?
- Things got messy.

05:07.559 --> 05:09.955
Without Lucy, we were
scrambling till we figured out

05:09.958 --> 05:11.425
- who they were after.
- We were almost too late.

05:11.427 --> 05:13.029
Sleeper Agent started shooting at us.

05:13.031 --> 05:15.034
Yeah, and we couldn't shoot
back 'cause there was kids.

05:15.036 --> 05:16.966
- Kids?
- We barely made it out alive.

05:16.968 --> 05:18.701
Wait, where's Flynn?

05:18.703 --> 05:21.037
- We had to split up.
- You left him there?

05:21.039 --> 05:23.973
We're gonna go back and pick him up.

05:23.975 --> 05:26.475
After we deal with our, uh, situation.

05:26.477 --> 05:27.711
Situation?

05:31.683 --> 05:32.683
Who is that?

05:33.785 --> 05:36.686
- All right.
- Oh, my God.

05:36.688 --> 05:39.355
Please tell me that's
not who I think it is.

05:39.357 --> 05:40.690
It's not who you think it is,

05:40.692 --> 05:42.024
unless you think it's young JFK.

05:42.026 --> 05:43.693
Then it's definitely
who you think it is.

05:43.695 --> 05:45.828
John F. Kennedy?

05:45.830 --> 05:48.798
You brought President Kennedy?
Are you out of your minds?

05:48.800 --> 05:50.199
Well, he was knocked out, okay?

05:50.201 --> 05:51.955
He doesn't know where or when he is.

05:51.958 --> 05:53.029
They were gonna kill him.

05:53.032 --> 05:54.591
They chased us all the
way to the "Lifeboat."

05:54.593 --> 05:56.305
- This was our best option.
- It was our only option.

05:56.307 --> 05:58.207
Besides, we... we have a plan.

05:58.209 --> 05:59.976
Flynn's gonna take care
of Rittenhouse in '34.

05:59.978 --> 06:02.345
We're gonna recharge the
"Lifeboat" and take JFK back.

06:02.347 --> 06:04.080
- And pick up Flynn.
- Yeah, sure, that too.

06:04.082 --> 06:05.748
Okay, so let me get this straight.

06:05.750 --> 06:07.884
We just need to keep
John alive long enough

06:07.886 --> 06:09.752
so we can return him so he can become

06:09.754 --> 06:11.019
arguably the most beloved president

06:11.021 --> 06:12.755
of the 20th century.

06:12.757 --> 06:13.991
No big deal.

06:16.160 --> 06:17.760
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey.

06:17.762 --> 06:19.295
You're all right.

06:19.297 --> 06:21.084
Don't be scared. We're
not gonna hurt you.

06:21.087 --> 06:22.720
Who are you people?

06:24.301 --> 06:26.167
P-private security.

06:26.170 --> 06:28.571
Uh, your father hired us to protect you.

06:28.573 --> 06:30.837
Mr. Greer. My English teacher.

06:30.840 --> 06:32.375
He... he tried to kill me.

06:32.377 --> 06:33.577
Why would he do that?

06:36.418 --> 06:39.581
You come from a wealthy family, John,

06:39.584 --> 06:41.083
and, uh, we think that Mr. Greer

06:41.085 --> 06:42.852
was trying to kidnap you

06:42.854 --> 06:47.790
for ransom, and Wyatt
and Rufus here saved you.

06:47.792 --> 06:49.325
I need to talk to my father.

06:49.327 --> 06:50.785
I just got off the phone with him.

06:50.788 --> 06:51.984
He's on his way.

06:52.980 --> 06:55.330
Am I in a storage closet?

06:55.333 --> 06:58.431
You're safe. And that's what matters.

06:58.434 --> 07:01.203
So why don't you rest and
just make yourself comfortable.

07:01.205 --> 07:04.273
I know that this is a
lot to take in, so, um,

07:04.276 --> 07:09.013
uh, we'll come back, uh, when
it's time for you to go home.

07:15.586 --> 07:18.208
Hey, hey, you feeling any better?

07:18.211 --> 07:19.810
I'm fine.

07:19.813 --> 07:21.590
It's hard to imagine that skinny kid

07:21.592 --> 07:23.459
grows up to bang Marilyn Monroe, huh?

07:23.461 --> 07:26.929
Hmm, Kennedy's intern
and mistress Mimi Alfred

07:26.931 --> 07:28.631
said that he had a way
of making a woman feel

07:28.633 --> 07:30.366
like she was the only one that mattered,

07:30.368 --> 07:32.068
even when he was
married to someone else.

07:34.305 --> 07:36.238
Look, I'm sorry. I know
this is really weird.

07:36.240 --> 07:37.940
But I didn't have a choice.
I couldn't take the...

07:37.942 --> 07:40.142
- This is so awkward for me.
- There you are.

07:42.246 --> 07:43.572
Did I interrupt something?

07:43.575 --> 07:46.082
- No.
- Hmm.

07:46.084 --> 07:47.917
I was, uh,

07:47.927 --> 07:49.961
just gonna get John something to eat.

07:55.626 --> 07:58.327
Our secret bunker's
getting kind of crowded.

07:58.329 --> 08:01.732
Thought, uh, JFK might
be a little hungry.

08:02.632 --> 08:04.666
It's been a tough week for you.

08:04.669 --> 08:06.268
I'm on the mend.

08:06.270 --> 08:08.070
That's not what I meant.

08:08.072 --> 08:10.306
You've been quiet since
you got back from Salem,

08:10.308 --> 08:12.074
and I have a feeling I know why.

08:12.076 --> 08:13.176
You do?

08:14.345 --> 08:18.280
Your mother tried to have
you hanged as a witch.

08:18.282 --> 08:20.750
I imagine that'd be just
a little bit upsetting.

08:20.752 --> 08:22.151
Do you want to talk about it?

08:22.153 --> 08:25.354
Not really, but thanks for asking.

08:25.356 --> 08:28.125
I hope he enjoys whatever that is.

08:34.097 --> 08:35.698
John?

08:37.701 --> 08:40.835
I thought you might be
hungry, so I made you a...

08:48.547 --> 08:49.814
Guys.

08:51.059 --> 08:52.260
Guys!

09:01.062 --> 09:03.606
Can't tell how far back it goes.

09:03.608 --> 09:05.274
I spoke with the guards upstairs.

09:05.276 --> 09:06.729
They didn't see him.

09:06.732 --> 09:09.111
Oh, my God, if we don't put
JFK back where he belongs,

09:09.113 --> 09:11.580
he doesn't become president,
no JFK, no Peace Corps,

09:11.582 --> 09:13.516
- no Civil Rights Act...
- No immigration reform.

09:13.519 --> 09:15.019
But there is nuclear war with Cuba.

09:15.022 --> 09:17.185
All right, look. Nothing
is gonna happen to JFK.

09:17.188 --> 09:18.799
We're gonna find him. Rufus...

09:18.802 --> 09:20.956
Jiya and I will check
traffic and security cams.

09:20.959 --> 09:22.343
Okay, great. I'm gonna need a car.

09:22.346 --> 09:23.526
No, not a chance.

09:23.528 --> 09:24.960
Rittenhouse could come after you.

09:24.962 --> 09:26.362
Rittenhouse will come after him.

09:26.364 --> 09:27.963
So unless we're okay with finding out

09:27.966 --> 09:30.406
what a world looks like after
a few dozen mushroom clouds...

09:30.409 --> 09:32.581
All right. I'll run
point from my office.

09:32.584 --> 09:34.551
I need all of you to stay
in touch with me, okay?

09:34.554 --> 09:36.539
All right, hey, I think you
ought to sit this one out.

09:36.541 --> 09:39.775
- Get some rest.
- Oh, I can come with you.

09:39.777 --> 09:41.911
I don't really think
that's probably a good idea.

09:41.913 --> 09:43.362
- Why not?
- This is a matter

09:43.365 --> 09:45.877
of national security. These
missions are dangerous.

09:45.880 --> 09:47.781
Well, she's a teacher, right?

09:49.820 --> 09:51.220
Ooh.

09:51.222 --> 09:53.674
Never mind. Just... trying to help.

09:53.677 --> 09:56.044
You know what? Uh...

09:56.047 --> 09:58.881
Maybe you're right. Uh...

09:58.884 --> 10:02.085
More eyes the better, right?

10:02.088 --> 10:05.733
Okay, fine. Just be careful.

10:05.736 --> 10:09.438
You know what? I'll come too.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.240
Lucy, you are still recovering.

10:11.242 --> 10:14.410
I'm... I'm feeling better,
and didn't Wyatt say

10:14.412 --> 10:16.378
can't hurt to have more eyes?

10:16.380 --> 10:18.280
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

10:18.282 --> 10:21.417
The closest building is a
gas station two miles away.

10:21.419 --> 10:23.953
Okay.

10:35.833 --> 10:38.067
Hey, baby.

10:38.069 --> 10:39.468
Hey, let's order, uh...

10:39.470 --> 10:41.403
Download a movie and just chill tonight.

10:52.049 --> 10:53.616
Can I help you?

10:53.618 --> 10:55.651
Pardon me. Where can
I find a pay telephone?

10:55.653 --> 10:58.721
A pay phone? I don't know, a museum?

10:58.723 --> 11:00.743
Please, I-I need to call my father.

11:00.746 --> 11:02.291
I think I've been kidnapped.

11:02.293 --> 11:03.659
Whoa. Seriously?

11:03.661 --> 11:06.195
Okay, here, use mine.

11:06.197 --> 11:07.663
- What is this?
- My phone.

11:07.665 --> 11:10.132
This isn't a telephone.

11:10.134 --> 11:12.535
Okay, um, let me.
What's your dad's number?

11:12.537 --> 11:14.503
Gramercy 5934.

11:14.505 --> 11:17.206
Is... is that international?

11:19.010 --> 11:20.643
- What's today's date?
- April 5th.

11:20.645 --> 11:23.879
- What year?
- 2018.

11:23.881 --> 11:25.714
How can this be?

11:30.154 --> 11:32.054
Um, are you in line?

11:32.056 --> 11:35.340
No, go ahead.

11:35.343 --> 11:36.792
Hey, is something wrong?

11:42.466 --> 11:44.563
I'm having a rather strange day.

11:45.703 --> 11:47.837
Well, I hope your day gets better.

11:49.574 --> 11:51.207
Wait.

11:51.209 --> 11:52.908
Uh...

11:52.910 --> 11:55.945
- Can I hitch a ride with you?
- Where's your car?

11:55.947 --> 11:59.181
- I don't have one.
- Why don't you call an Uber?

11:59.183 --> 12:01.784
I don't know who that is.

12:01.786 --> 12:04.587
Uh, we're going to Palo
Alto. Where do you need to go?

12:04.589 --> 12:07.723
Anywhere far from here.

12:07.725 --> 12:10.159
Palo Alto.

12:10.161 --> 12:12.761
That's in California, right?

12:12.763 --> 12:14.697
He's weird.

12:14.699 --> 12:17.766
But he can come.

12:20.671 --> 12:22.238
7 million people in the Bay Area,

12:22.241 --> 12:24.206
and we're supposed to
find one horny teenage boy?

12:24.208 --> 12:25.908
It's gonna be fine. We'll find him.

12:25.910 --> 12:28.177
You sound quite sure of that.

12:28.179 --> 12:29.578
Well, think about it.

12:29.580 --> 12:31.413
We all still know who JFK is, right?

12:31.415 --> 12:33.189
- Must mean we're gonna find him.
- Come again?

12:33.191 --> 12:34.917
What a fascinating loop.

12:34.919 --> 12:36.852
Jiya is suggesting that
because we still know

12:36.854 --> 12:39.088
JFK becomes president in '61,

12:39.090 --> 12:41.598
very fact that we're
still aware of him really

12:41.601 --> 12:43.282
proves that he eventually makes it back

12:43.285 --> 12:44.627
to where he's supposed to be.

12:44.629 --> 12:46.595
Yeah, for now, until
he gets hit by a car

12:46.597 --> 12:49.732
or shot by Rittenhouse, then
history changes in an instant.

12:49.734 --> 12:52.234
- And we don't even know it.
- Yeah, that's true too.

12:52.236 --> 12:54.158
- Okay, what about my visions.
- What about your visions?

12:54.160 --> 12:56.272
I had a vision about a
man dying and he died.

12:56.274 --> 12:58.007
You tried to stop it,
but history doesn't change

12:58.009 --> 12:59.638
- as easily as you want it to.
- Okay, that's more like

12:59.640 --> 13:00.872
a self-fulfilling prophecy.

13:00.875 --> 13:02.582
Or maybe it's just a prophecy.

13:02.585 --> 13:03.912
Sorry, what are we talking about?

13:03.914 --> 13:05.347
Never mind. Forget it.

13:11.289 --> 13:12.454
Hello?

13:12.456 --> 13:13.622
Just a sec.

13:13.624 --> 13:15.090
Okay, so here's the deal.

13:15.092 --> 13:17.326
John's my brother,
and he's off his meds.

13:17.328 --> 13:18.494
Okay, who am I?

13:18.496 --> 13:21.597
You're... my friend.

13:21.599 --> 13:23.899
We can be friends, can't we?

13:23.901 --> 13:25.467
Okay, dumb question,

13:25.469 --> 13:27.251
but why don't you guys
just tell the truth?

13:27.254 --> 13:28.771
Oh, that we're looking
for President Kennedy

13:28.773 --> 13:30.472
who time traveled from 1934?

13:30.474 --> 13:33.173
Okay, well, not all that.
But Wyatt's military.

13:33.176 --> 13:34.843
They should answer his questions, right?

13:34.845 --> 13:36.378
Yeah, well, we normally try to keep

13:36.380 --> 13:37.780
a lower profile than that, so...

13:37.782 --> 13:40.582
- Why?
- Because.

13:40.584 --> 13:43.152
Sorry about that. How can I help you?

13:43.154 --> 13:45.707
Yeah, we are, uh,
looking for a teenage boy

13:45.710 --> 13:47.589
that might have came
through here, skinny kid,

13:47.591 --> 13:49.625
light blue sport coat, tie.

13:49.627 --> 13:51.727
Sorry, haven't seen him.

13:53.364 --> 13:56.665
All right, look. Uh...

13:56.667 --> 13:58.574
- U.S. Army.
- So?

13:58.577 --> 13:59.910
Please.

13:59.913 --> 14:01.403
We've been looking everyone for him.

14:01.405 --> 14:03.005
He's my brother, and he wandered

14:03.007 --> 14:05.074
- out of the house today.
- What's wrong with him?

14:05.076 --> 14:07.609
He suffers from delusions and paranoia.

14:07.611 --> 14:09.114
I mean, he thinks that
people are after him.

14:09.116 --> 14:10.946
He'll be fine as soon as
we can get him his meds.

14:10.948 --> 14:12.381
- Mm.
- What meds?

14:12.383 --> 14:13.949
- What? What meds?
- Um...

14:13.951 --> 14:16.352
Risperidone.

14:16.354 --> 14:18.187
It's an antipsychotic.

14:18.189 --> 14:21.690
I can call his doctor if you'd like.

14:21.692 --> 14:23.425
H-he came by about 40 minutes ago.

14:23.427 --> 14:25.027
Do you know where he went?

14:25.029 --> 14:26.962
He left with some kids.

14:26.964 --> 14:28.652
I think I heard 'em say

14:28.655 --> 14:30.733
- they were heading to Palo Alto.
- Palo Alto.

14:30.735 --> 14:32.167
Do you have any idea
what they were driving?

14:32.169 --> 14:34.236
Hard to forget. It was a red BMW.

14:34.238 --> 14:35.704
- Red BMW, thanks a lot.
- Great.

14:35.706 --> 14:37.309
- Okay.
- Thank you.

14:44.181 --> 14:47.249
So, uh, how do you all know each other?

14:47.251 --> 14:48.684
From school.

14:48.686 --> 14:51.186
You all go to the same school?

14:51.188 --> 14:54.123
- Together?
- Yeah.

14:54.125 --> 14:56.592
- Why?
- My school's pretty boring.

14:56.594 --> 14:59.066
And, uh, white.

14:59.069 --> 15:01.730
Oh. Private school?

15:03.801 --> 15:05.334
Are you okay?

15:05.336 --> 15:06.869
Swell.

15:08.439 --> 15:10.672
Okay. What's your deal?

15:10.674 --> 15:13.075
My... deal?

15:13.077 --> 15:14.710
Yeah, what's with the funny suit?

15:14.712 --> 15:17.946
And who were you hiding from back there?

15:17.948 --> 15:19.948
What's wrong with my suit?

15:19.950 --> 15:21.717
It's a nice suit.

15:21.719 --> 15:23.685
You're obviously in
some type of trouble.

15:23.687 --> 15:27.122
Just tell us what it is and
then maybe we can help you.

15:32.630 --> 15:34.596
There are people after me.

15:34.598 --> 15:36.432
They kidnapped me and kept me

15:36.434 --> 15:38.840
in some kind of, uh, underground bunker.

15:38.843 --> 15:43.271
I... I don't know who
they are or what they want.

15:43.274 --> 15:45.040
It's hard to explain.

15:45.042 --> 15:47.242
Why don't you just go to the police?

15:47.244 --> 15:50.179
The police can't help me.

15:50.181 --> 15:51.434
John.

15:51.437 --> 15:55.005
- John, what is it?
- My stomach.

15:55.008 --> 15:57.185
Do either of you have
any TUMS or something?

15:57.188 --> 15:59.684
- I need... I need a doctor.
- What's wrong with him?

15:59.687 --> 16:01.541
I don't... I don't know,
but he does not look good.

16:01.543 --> 16:02.724
We need to get him to a hospital.

16:02.726 --> 16:04.159
Yo, he better not puke in my car.

16:04.161 --> 16:05.994
Just go.

16:09.099 --> 16:10.833
Rufus, what do you mean you lost 'em?

16:10.835 --> 16:12.205
There aren't cameras on every street.

16:12.207 --> 16:13.512
They drove out of range.

16:13.515 --> 16:15.003
Well, what direction were they heading?

16:15.005 --> 16:16.338
South on Willow.

16:16.340 --> 16:17.840
All right. What's in the area?

16:17.842 --> 16:19.308
There's a Chinese restaurant,

16:19.310 --> 16:20.943
Starbucks, Bailey's Bar and Grille,

16:20.945 --> 16:22.535
a hospital, a park...

16:22.538 --> 16:24.178
I don't know much about JFK,

16:24.181 --> 16:25.985
but a bar sounds right up his alley.

16:25.988 --> 16:27.868
No, no, no, I bet he's
going to the hospital.

16:27.871 --> 16:29.084
What makes you say that?

16:29.086 --> 16:31.520
Well, John suffered from
health issues his entire life.

16:31.522 --> 16:33.655
Spent most of his childhood
in and out of hospitals.

16:33.657 --> 16:35.791
I mean, Bobby even joked that
if someone ever were to write

16:35.793 --> 16:37.192
a book about his brother,
it would be titled

16:37.194 --> 16:38.704
"John F. Kennedy: A Medical History."

16:38.707 --> 16:40.043
Doesn't mean he's sick now.

16:40.046 --> 16:42.029
Stress probably makes
his conditions worse.

16:42.032 --> 16:44.566
And I'm imagining he's probably
pretty stressed right now.

16:44.568 --> 16:46.301
If we're wrong...

16:46.303 --> 16:49.304
Hey, I'd go with the
historian on this one.

16:49.306 --> 16:51.306
I mean, she's kept you
alive this long, right?

16:53.043 --> 16:54.843
Hospital it is.

16:57.848 --> 16:59.915
Things didn't go as planned.

16:59.917 --> 17:01.450
They got JFK.

17:01.452 --> 17:03.552
Did Lucy get involved?

17:03.554 --> 17:05.654
No, I didn't see her there.

17:05.656 --> 17:08.656
But they took Kennedy in the "Lifeboat."

17:08.659 --> 17:10.592
I think he's here somewhere.

17:10.594 --> 17:11.894
Then find him.

17:11.896 --> 17:13.028
From everything I've read,

17:13.030 --> 17:14.695
Kennedy galvanized this nation

17:14.698 --> 17:16.898
in a direction that runs
counter to our goals.

17:16.901 --> 17:18.500
We need someone in that Oval Office

17:18.502 --> 17:19.902
that we can control.

17:19.904 --> 17:21.904
- Like Nixon.
- I'm working on it.

17:21.906 --> 17:25.003
I know where we can find Kennedy.

17:25.007 --> 17:26.373
I'm listening.

17:26.376 --> 17:28.509
Kennedy's chronic health issues

17:28.512 --> 17:30.712
are one of history's best-kept secrets.

17:30.714 --> 17:33.556
Ulcers, colitis, blood infections.

17:33.559 --> 17:35.751
With everything that
he's just been through,

17:35.753 --> 17:37.626
I wouldn't be surprised if he fell ill.

17:37.629 --> 17:38.887
What do you suggest?

17:38.889 --> 17:40.923
We search every hospital in the city.

17:40.925 --> 17:42.848
Sooner or later,
Kennedy's bound to show up

17:42.851 --> 17:45.760
at one of them, and when
he does, we take him out.

17:49.366 --> 17:51.400
All right. Send out one of our men.

17:51.402 --> 17:55.037
No. I got this.

17:55.039 --> 17:58.874
- I'll figure it out.
- Thank you, Emma.

17:58.876 --> 18:01.510
And if you run into
Lucy and her friends,

18:01.512 --> 18:03.845
take them out as well.

18:05.616 --> 18:07.049
With pleasure.

18:14.850 --> 18:17.418
- You get the plate on the BMW?
- Uh, no.

18:17.429 --> 18:19.103
Call me when you do.

18:32.508 --> 18:35.943
This is like being stoned
to death with popcorn.

18:35.945 --> 18:36.992
We're never gonna find the boy using

18:36.994 --> 18:38.785
- such primitive technology.
- At least we have computers.

18:38.787 --> 18:40.780
Try doing this with
a Civil War spyglass.

18:40.783 --> 18:42.127
No, I'm calling Agent Christopher.

18:42.129 --> 18:44.618
What we need are drones.

18:44.620 --> 18:46.274
Still think we're gonna find JFK?

18:46.277 --> 18:48.188
Found the car, didn't
we? Have a little faith.

18:48.190 --> 18:50.072
I don't have any faith,
but you already know that.

18:50.074 --> 18:51.992
Okay.

18:51.994 --> 18:53.460
You don't ever wonder if there's

18:53.462 --> 18:54.862
something bigger out there?

18:54.864 --> 18:56.964
What, like extraterrestrials?

18:56.966 --> 18:59.700
No, there's definitely
extraterrestrials.

18:59.702 --> 19:02.302
I mean...

19:02.304 --> 19:03.804
A higher power.

19:03.806 --> 19:05.884
Okay, where's this coming from?

19:05.887 --> 19:07.333
- Is this about your visions?
- Okay, look, I know

19:07.335 --> 19:09.392
it sounds crazy but I feel like
I'm having them for a reason.

19:09.394 --> 19:12.513
Look, they're side effects
of... of time travel, okay?

19:12.515 --> 19:14.448
There's no such thing as a higher power.

19:14.450 --> 19:16.483
Okay, then how do you explain
my heart murmur being cured?

19:16.485 --> 19:18.051
Or the fact that all my
visions have come true?

19:18.053 --> 19:19.453
All side effects, okay?

19:19.455 --> 19:20.988
If everything happens for a reason,

19:20.990 --> 19:22.635
then what's the reason
for JFK getting shot

19:22.637 --> 19:25.526
by some crazy dude with three names?

19:25.528 --> 19:27.028
I don't know.

19:29.464 --> 19:31.163
Look.

19:31.166 --> 19:32.900
When I was a kid,

19:32.902 --> 19:36.870
my mom used to thank God for
every good thing that happened.

19:36.872 --> 19:38.939
And when something bad
happened, she'd say,

19:38.941 --> 19:41.675
"Everything happens for a
reason," or, "God has a plan."

19:43.612 --> 19:49.182
I watched my mom get on her
knees and pray every night,

19:49.184 --> 19:53.487
begging God to take us out
of our crappy neighborhood.

19:53.489 --> 19:55.522
But you know who did?

19:55.524 --> 19:58.292
Me.

19:58.294 --> 20:00.060
God doesn't exist.

20:00.062 --> 20:01.728
Pardon the interruption,

20:01.730 --> 20:03.565
but I can't get a hold
of Agent Christopher.

20:03.568 --> 20:04.698
Did you try her office?

20:04.700 --> 20:07.200
Yeah, of course, but apparently she...

20:07.202 --> 20:09.236
No one's seen her.

20:09.238 --> 20:11.606
Then where is she?

20:13.042 --> 20:14.741
Agent Christopher.

20:14.743 --> 20:17.611
We haven't formally met.

20:17.613 --> 20:20.247
- I'm Carol Preston.
- I know who you are.

20:20.249 --> 20:22.597
I wanted to talk, one mother to another.

20:22.600 --> 20:24.326
You couldn't just text, Carol?

20:24.329 --> 20:26.553
Hmm, you know, despite
what you must think,

20:26.555 --> 20:29.081
I do care about my daughter very much.

20:29.084 --> 20:31.792
I was young when I
got pregnant with Lucy.

20:31.794 --> 20:34.227
I naively thought that I could

20:34.229 --> 20:37.064
give her up for adoption
without my family knowing.

20:37.066 --> 20:39.600
So you didn't want your
child to be Rittenhouse.

20:41.403 --> 20:44.972
Unlike Lucy, I've known
about my place in Rittenhouse

20:44.974 --> 20:47.474
since I was 15 years old.

20:47.476 --> 20:49.543
It was a burden.

20:49.545 --> 20:52.913
So I convinced myself
that not keeping my child

20:52.915 --> 20:55.503
was the right thing to do.
That must have been tough.

20:55.506 --> 20:57.317
It wasn't.

20:57.319 --> 20:58.986
Not at first.

20:58.988 --> 21:00.904
Then the weeks went by,

21:00.907 --> 21:03.457
and I felt her growing inside me.

21:03.459 --> 21:07.328
Then I started to wonder
what she might be like.

21:08.664 --> 21:10.497
And by the time she
came into this world,

21:10.499 --> 21:12.833
I knew there was no way
I was gonna let her go.

21:12.835 --> 21:14.635
Why are you telling me this?

21:14.637 --> 21:17.771
Because I can't protect
my daughter anymore.

21:17.773 --> 21:19.906
Rittenhouse will kill Lucy

21:19.908 --> 21:22.109
if she continues to
interfere with their plans.

21:22.111 --> 21:26.513
So I need you to keep my
daughter off of these missions.

21:26.515 --> 21:28.362
It's the only way to keep her safe.

21:28.365 --> 21:29.650
What do you expect me to do?

21:29.652 --> 21:30.779
- Tie Lucy up...
- Yes.

21:30.782 --> 21:31.985
- Until all this is over?
- Yes.

21:31.987 --> 21:33.487
If that's what it takes.

21:33.489 --> 21:34.787
If you think that's gonna work,

21:34.790 --> 21:36.490
then you don't know
your daughter at all.

21:36.492 --> 21:38.959
Oh, I was hoping

21:38.961 --> 21:43.130
that you of all people would understand.

21:43.132 --> 21:46.065
You know, I would think
long and hard about this,

21:46.068 --> 21:47.501
Agent Christopher.

21:47.503 --> 21:49.336
It'd be a shame if your children

21:49.338 --> 21:51.838
grow up without a mother.

21:57.680 --> 21:59.846
God, I hate hospitals.

21:59.848 --> 22:02.215
- Remember Hawaii?
- Ugh, don't remind me.

22:02.217 --> 22:03.617
What happened?

22:03.619 --> 22:05.385
Uh, we were on a surfing trip.

22:05.387 --> 22:06.928
- You surf?
- Yeah.

22:06.931 --> 22:09.073
Eh... not as well as he thinks he does.

22:09.076 --> 22:10.357
- No.
- You wiped out.

22:10.359 --> 22:12.526
Hit himself on the head with
a board, got a concussion.

22:12.528 --> 22:14.428
Ended up in this awful hospital.

22:14.430 --> 22:16.329
You remember that?

22:16.331 --> 22:19.399
I remember that you never left my side.

22:19.401 --> 22:22.669
You slept in that
uncomfortable chair for days.

22:22.671 --> 22:24.404
I remember that.

22:33.682 --> 22:35.649
Knock, knock.

22:35.651 --> 22:37.901
- You stayed.
- Yeah. You look better.

22:37.904 --> 22:40.253
This hospital is incredible.

22:40.255 --> 22:42.522
The medicine worked almost instantly.

22:42.524 --> 22:44.357
Um, I have to go soon.

22:44.359 --> 22:46.262
My brother's having this
party tonight that my friends

22:46.264 --> 22:47.994
have been looking forward to all week.

22:47.996 --> 22:50.664
I just wanted to make sure you're okay.

22:50.666 --> 22:52.532
Is there anybody that
I can call for you?

22:52.534 --> 22:54.335
Family or...

22:56.137 --> 22:57.503
Kayla, we've been friends

22:57.506 --> 22:59.372
for all of two hours, wouldn't you say?

22:59.374 --> 23:03.076
- Just about.
- Yeah, so I can trust you.

23:03.078 --> 23:04.778
Obviously.

23:04.780 --> 23:07.380
What I'm about to tell you
is going to sound crazy.

23:07.382 --> 23:10.751
Crazier than you being kidnapped?

23:10.753 --> 23:12.419
When I woke up this morning,

23:12.421 --> 23:15.555
I was at my boarding
school in Connecticut.

23:15.557 --> 23:18.558
The year was 1934.

23:18.560 --> 23:20.227
Then a group of strangers kidnapped me

23:20.229 --> 23:23.764
and brought me here
to the, uh... future.

23:26.268 --> 23:28.253
What kind of meds did they give you?

23:28.256 --> 23:30.637
I promise.

23:30.639 --> 23:33.273
It's the truth.

23:33.275 --> 23:35.275
I need to find a time machine.

23:35.277 --> 23:38.278
John, time machines don't exist.

23:38.280 --> 23:39.846
But they must.

23:39.848 --> 23:42.816
How else could I be here?

23:42.818 --> 23:44.151
The bunker.

23:44.153 --> 23:45.485
There must be a time machine

23:45.487 --> 23:46.787
at the place where I was locked up.

23:46.789 --> 23:48.563
Maybe it's the only one of its kind.

23:48.566 --> 23:50.066
Wait, you're saying you want to go back

23:50.068 --> 23:51.725
to the place that you just escaped from?

23:51.727 --> 23:55.262
Maybe that's the only way I
can get back home to my time.

23:55.264 --> 23:57.197
And I could really use your help.

23:58.954 --> 24:01.134
Hi, I'm looking for my
brother, John Kennedy.

24:01.136 --> 24:02.669
I got a message saying that he was here.

24:02.671 --> 24:04.938
Popular kid. He should be out soon.

24:04.940 --> 24:06.640
I know they're all trying
to get to some party.

24:06.642 --> 24:08.896
Oh, can, uh... Can we see him?

24:08.899 --> 24:11.354
Like I told his aunt, you're
gonna have to wait here

24:11.357 --> 24:13.513
- until there's an update.
- Aunt?

24:13.515 --> 24:16.183
Excuse me.

24:17.786 --> 24:19.319
Room 325. Let's go.

24:40.642 --> 24:42.323
Whoa! Whoa!

25:18.247 --> 25:21.081
Wyatt. Jessica, over there.

25:28.423 --> 25:30.257
Uh-uh.

25:30.259 --> 25:31.591
I wouldn't if I were you.

25:33.290 --> 25:34.895
Or maybe her life doesn't matter anymore

25:34.897 --> 25:36.495
now that you have your wife back.

25:40.202 --> 25:42.068
Do it.

25:42.070 --> 25:44.571
She's their only pilot.

25:47.776 --> 25:49.396
Do it.

25:52.614 --> 25:55.215
Lucy. Lucy. Are you all right?

25:55.217 --> 25:57.784
- You okay? Yeah?
- Yeah.

25:57.786 --> 26:00.453
Go, go, go.

26:00.455 --> 26:02.756
Drop the gun now!

26:10.074 --> 26:12.487
This is a mistake. Wyatt was
the one that was attacked.

26:12.490 --> 26:13.948
Take it up with the police
when they get here.

26:13.950 --> 26:15.212
Look, I have a license for the gun.

26:15.214 --> 26:16.794
I'm U.S. Army Special Forces.

26:16.797 --> 26:18.745
Call Agent Denise Christopher
at Homeland Security.

26:18.747 --> 26:20.246
- She'll clear it all up.
- There must be someone

26:20.248 --> 26:22.622
in management that we can talk
to... who is your supervisor?

26:22.625 --> 26:24.388
His name is Lou Ritchey,
and he's gone for the day.

26:24.390 --> 26:25.500
Of course he is.

26:25.503 --> 26:26.834
Ma'am, you should wait in the lobby.

26:26.836 --> 26:29.450
The police want to talk to the
both of you when they get here.

26:29.453 --> 26:31.371
You slipped him a paper clip.

26:31.373 --> 26:33.841
Don't worry. We've done this before.

26:36.378 --> 26:38.411
You don't want to get
that checked, we're here?

26:38.413 --> 26:41.314
I'll live. We've got
much bigger problems.

26:45.521 --> 26:48.054
You okay?

26:48.056 --> 26:52.125
The way Wyatt looked
at you back there...

26:52.127 --> 26:54.895
Doesn't take a professor
to figure it out.

26:54.897 --> 26:57.264
I get it.

26:57.266 --> 26:59.466
He thought I was dead and...

26:59.468 --> 27:01.289
it's not like he was
faithful to me before.

27:01.292 --> 27:03.559
I don't know why he'd
be faithful to me now.

27:03.562 --> 27:05.939
- Jessica, it's...
- Look, Lucy, this was fun.

27:05.941 --> 27:08.542
And insane.

27:08.544 --> 27:11.745
And I believe Wyatt's changed.

27:11.747 --> 27:13.659
Yesterday I was ready to divorce him,

27:13.662 --> 27:16.195
and after seeing him
like this I thought...

27:16.198 --> 27:17.598
maybe he's right.

27:17.601 --> 27:21.588
Maybe he does deserve
another chance, but...

27:21.590 --> 27:23.123
I don't think I'm the one

27:23.125 --> 27:25.025
he should be getting that chance with.

27:28.397 --> 27:30.564
Tell him I said bye.

27:32.701 --> 27:33.934
Okay.

27:35.938 --> 27:37.904
Jessica, wait. Wait.

27:37.906 --> 27:40.040
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, just...

27:40.042 --> 27:42.076
Just don't leave yet. Hear me out, okay?

27:44.812 --> 27:46.846
When we went to 1962 Vegas,

27:46.849 --> 27:48.949
Wyatt sent you a telegram
from Western Union.

27:48.951 --> 27:50.584
- Like in "Back to the Future"?
- Yes.

27:50.586 --> 27:53.320
Like in "Back to the
Future," but it didn't work.

27:53.322 --> 27:56.089
So then he stole the "Lifeboat"
to try and go back and stop

27:56.091 --> 27:57.390
your killer from ever being born,

27:57.392 --> 27:58.658
but it didn't work either.

27:58.660 --> 28:00.994
And he got court-martialed for it too.

28:00.996 --> 28:03.496
- He did?
- Yes.

28:03.498 --> 28:05.465
My point is...

28:07.436 --> 28:09.803
Even though you weren't there,

28:09.805 --> 28:12.105
you were always on Wyatt's mind.

28:12.107 --> 28:15.542
He risked his job, his
freedom, everything,

28:15.544 --> 28:17.744
because he never stopped loving you,

28:17.746 --> 28:20.146
not for a second.

28:20.148 --> 28:24.417
And all he wants, all
that he has wanted,

28:24.419 --> 28:26.286
is a chance to show you that.

28:27.890 --> 28:30.824
Let's go.

28:30.826 --> 28:33.106
Oh, what? How?

28:33.109 --> 28:35.462
Told you we've been doing this a while.

28:38.700 --> 28:39.766
You in?

28:53.782 --> 28:56.650
Good? Ready?

29:11.398 --> 29:12.699
John Kennedy?

29:12.701 --> 29:14.814
Like the President? That's what he said.

29:14.817 --> 29:17.051
Kayla, this guy is obviously unstable.

29:17.054 --> 29:19.020
Maybe we shouldn't have
brought him to your house.

29:19.023 --> 29:21.374
My mom will be back
tomorrow. She's a shrink.

29:21.376 --> 29:24.611
She helps troubled kids
like him all the time.

29:24.613 --> 29:27.747
Heads up. Hail to the Chief.

29:27.749 --> 29:29.149
Are you ready to go?

29:29.151 --> 29:31.284
Actually, I was thinking

29:31.286 --> 29:33.778
it's... it's kind of dark outside.

29:33.781 --> 29:36.529
It might be kind of hard
to find a secret bunker.

29:36.532 --> 29:38.465
So why don't you just stay here

29:38.468 --> 29:40.360
and then we can go first thing tomorrow?

29:40.362 --> 29:42.829
I suppose that'll
give us time to come up

29:42.831 --> 29:44.764
with an actual plan.

29:44.766 --> 29:46.942
Any chance I can sneak a gin rickey?

29:49.972 --> 29:51.404
Come on.

29:51.406 --> 29:53.273
- Let's go somewhere quieter.
- Yeah.

29:55.077 --> 29:57.844
I hope you've had sufficient
time to reconsider.

29:57.846 --> 29:59.312
I have.

29:59.314 --> 30:00.880
In my line of work,

30:00.882 --> 30:04.036
we all have that one
case we can't shake.

30:04.039 --> 30:06.753
Mine was a school shooting in 2011.

30:06.755 --> 30:09.556
After it happened, I yanked
my kids out of their classrooms

30:09.558 --> 30:11.520
and decided they were
going to be homeschooled.

30:11.523 --> 30:13.093
There was no discussion.

30:13.095 --> 30:14.527
I needed them to be safe.

30:14.529 --> 30:16.278
You did what was best for your family.

30:16.281 --> 30:17.931
I did what was best for me.

30:17.933 --> 30:20.300
My son...

30:20.302 --> 30:22.002
he was so angry.

30:22.004 --> 30:24.471
It created such a rift between us

30:24.473 --> 30:28.341
that finally I had
to give in and let go.

30:28.343 --> 30:30.153
We all have to do that at some point.

30:30.156 --> 30:31.811
What are you talking...

30:33.615 --> 30:35.015
You're stalling.

30:41.123 --> 30:43.423
She's chipped.

30:43.425 --> 30:45.309
Your tax dollars at work.

30:45.312 --> 30:47.293
Thanks for giving me
that time to reconsider.

30:47.295 --> 30:48.895
Someone should be here any minute now.

30:48.897 --> 30:50.764
Do it.

30:55.126 --> 30:58.321
- Did you find JFK?
- No, we missed him.

30:58.324 --> 31:01.532
- Any luck finding the car?
- None. What now?

31:01.535 --> 31:03.468
Have you guys checked Instagram?

31:03.471 --> 31:05.901
That nurse mentioned something
about John going to a party.

31:05.904 --> 31:07.537
If he's at a party with a bunch of kids,

31:07.539 --> 31:10.106
he's bound to show up
in a picture or two.

31:10.108 --> 31:12.542
Hey, Rufus, she's right.
Check social media.

31:12.544 --> 31:14.244
Facebook, Instagram,
Snapchat, all of it.

31:14.246 --> 31:15.613
We're on it.

31:18.998 --> 31:20.831
Make yourself comfortable.

31:26.458 --> 31:29.025
Have you read all these books?

31:29.027 --> 31:30.961
Most of them.

31:30.963 --> 31:32.562
I love to read.

31:32.564 --> 31:35.031
Me too.

31:35.033 --> 31:37.834
Ah, "The Poetry of Robert Frost."

31:37.836 --> 31:39.936
You like poetry?

31:39.938 --> 31:41.471
I love it.

31:41.473 --> 31:43.573
All literature, really.

31:43.575 --> 31:46.276
I spend so many days sick in bed.

31:46.281 --> 31:48.177
My mother jokes she can hardly see me

31:48.180 --> 31:50.748
behind the books piled around my pillow.

31:55.940 --> 31:58.978
- You really do look like him.
- Like who?

32:05.998 --> 32:09.065
How did you get this photo?

32:09.067 --> 32:11.868
And what is this thing?

32:11.870 --> 32:16.235
It's an iPad. So... so this is you?

32:16.238 --> 32:17.607
You're President Kennedy?

32:17.609 --> 32:19.767
President of what?

32:22.049 --> 32:24.250
Of the United States.

32:26.070 --> 32:30.786
I become president of the United States?

32:30.789 --> 32:33.290
I... I don't understand.

32:33.292 --> 32:36.326
That was supposed to be my brother, Joe.

32:36.328 --> 32:40.997
Does this, uh, iPad know him too?

32:40.999 --> 32:43.767
Yeah.

32:43.769 --> 32:46.353
That's him.

32:46.356 --> 32:50.173
"Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. was
the oldest of nine children.

32:50.175 --> 32:52.342
"Graduated from Harvard College.

32:52.344 --> 32:55.679
Then went to Harvard
Law." Hey, good on him!

32:55.681 --> 32:57.914
"But he left before graduation

32:57.916 --> 33:03.329
to join the U.S. Navy
during World War II."

33:03.332 --> 33:07.000
World War II?

33:07.003 --> 33:10.205
"A naval pilot, he was...

33:10.208 --> 33:13.353
killed off the coast of France

33:13.356 --> 33:16.257
during a secret mission at age 29."

33:18.370 --> 33:22.672
It's the Kennedy curse.

33:22.674 --> 33:24.259
The what?

33:24.262 --> 33:27.409
Mm, people think that the
Kennedy family was cursed

33:27.412 --> 33:31.381
because so many of them died so young.

33:31.383 --> 33:33.350
You know what? You
really shouldn't... John.

33:33.352 --> 33:36.753
My sister Kathleen
died in a plane crash.

33:36.755 --> 33:38.856
Bobby was shot, just like...

33:40.292 --> 33:43.560
Just like his brother, John.

33:52.105 --> 33:54.004
Anything yet?

33:54.007 --> 33:55.941
Facebook's facial
recognition really thinks

33:55.944 --> 33:58.644
Ansel Elgort looks like JFK.

33:58.647 --> 34:01.348
- Wait, I think I found him.
- Really?

34:01.351 --> 34:03.149
That's definitely him.

34:03.152 --> 34:04.752
I think he's at someone's house.

34:04.755 --> 34:06.033
Can you pin his location?

34:06.036 --> 34:08.837
Tell me you got good news.

34:08.840 --> 34:10.643
490 Kingsley Road.

34:10.646 --> 34:12.947
Okay, I'll map it now. Thanks, guys.

34:17.728 --> 34:20.697
Denise?

34:20.699 --> 34:22.830
Are you hurt?

34:22.833 --> 34:24.333
Connor, what are you doing here?

34:24.335 --> 34:26.770
Looking for you. What happened?

34:26.772 --> 34:29.239
These agents managed to track your chip.

34:29.241 --> 34:31.440
Carol Preston wanted
to have a little chat.

34:31.443 --> 34:34.210
Mom? Who are you talking to?

34:34.212 --> 34:35.643
Hi, sweetie pie.

34:35.646 --> 34:37.342
Mom's just talking
to a friend from work.

34:37.346 --> 34:40.284
Just go back inside,
I'll be in in a minute.

34:42.614 --> 34:44.281
What is it?

34:44.284 --> 34:46.851
What did Lucy's mother want?

34:46.853 --> 34:50.155
To remind me that we both
have families to lose.

35:00.439 --> 35:03.506
Hey.

35:03.508 --> 35:05.252
Brought you something.

35:10.282 --> 35:13.583
- Is that... me?
- It's pretty cool, huh?

35:13.585 --> 35:16.019
Joe's the one who's
destined for greatness.

35:16.021 --> 35:18.822
He's smart and good

35:18.824 --> 35:21.057
and disciplined.

35:21.059 --> 35:24.594
Not like me.

35:24.597 --> 35:27.363
Okay. I think you had enough.

35:27.365 --> 35:29.432
Come on. You need to sober up.

35:29.435 --> 35:31.769
- Do you want to go get food...
- No, leave me alone.

35:40.021 --> 35:41.453
Ah, I see not much has changed

35:41.456 --> 35:42.814
since we were in high school.

35:42.817 --> 35:44.514
Hey, someone's mom is here!

35:44.516 --> 35:47.205
Mom, my ass.

35:47.208 --> 35:49.285
All right, you two see if
you can find him out here.

35:49.287 --> 35:51.621
- I'll check inside.
- Wait, wait, wait.

35:51.623 --> 35:54.557
If we find him, I'll just call you.

35:54.560 --> 35:56.961
Cell phones.

35:56.964 --> 35:59.197
We don't usually get cell
phones 'cause we're...

35:59.200 --> 36:00.721
- traveling to the past.
- Right.

36:01.893 --> 36:03.592
Go away.

36:05.999 --> 36:07.465
John.

36:07.468 --> 36:09.510
- We have to go.
- What-what's going on?

36:09.513 --> 36:11.373
I know my father didn't send you.

36:11.376 --> 36:14.077
Okay. You're right.

36:14.079 --> 36:16.679
I'm sorry we lied to you about that.

36:16.681 --> 36:19.716
We are trying to protect you.

36:19.718 --> 36:22.919
I want to go home.

36:22.921 --> 36:25.688
Great. Let's get you home.

36:30.595 --> 36:32.195
John!

36:37.269 --> 36:39.033
Miss, please help me!

36:43.871 --> 36:45.036
Kayla!

36:48.175 --> 36:49.879
Kayla!

36:49.882 --> 36:51.176
Everybody get down!

36:59.653 --> 37:01.520
Oh, my God. Are you guys okay?

37:01.522 --> 37:03.188
I-I think so.

37:03.190 --> 37:04.990
Kayla?

37:04.992 --> 37:06.994
So everything that you
told me, that was real?

37:09.196 --> 37:11.496
Oh, my God.

37:11.498 --> 37:13.698
Thank you for helping me.

37:13.700 --> 37:15.534
Even when you didn't believe me.

37:17.438 --> 37:21.339
Meeting you gives me
hope for the future.

37:21.341 --> 37:23.909
Your secret's safe with me.

37:33.253 --> 37:35.654
So... this is it.

37:35.656 --> 37:37.389
No one's going to believe this.

37:37.391 --> 37:39.586
Yeah, uh, about that,

37:39.589 --> 37:41.689
I wouldn't mention it
when you get back home.

37:41.692 --> 37:43.128
To anyone. Ever.

37:43.130 --> 37:45.263
The safety of the world
kind of depends on it.

37:45.265 --> 37:46.431
I understand.

37:46.433 --> 37:49.267
All right. You ready to go?

37:56.610 --> 37:58.543
John.

37:58.546 --> 38:00.927
You okay?

38:00.930 --> 38:04.049
I know about my siblings' deaths.

38:04.051 --> 38:06.117
My own assassination.

38:06.119 --> 38:08.386
Well, maybe you can change your fate.

38:13.827 --> 38:17.801
Don't go to Dallas on
November 22nd, 1963.

38:17.804 --> 38:19.703
What about the curse?

38:19.706 --> 38:22.606
Everyone I love is going
to die a tragic death.

38:22.609 --> 38:26.010
You may not be able to
save everybody, John, but

38:26.013 --> 38:29.941
you are going to make the
world a much better place.

38:29.943 --> 38:32.310
There are worse fates.

38:35.249 --> 38:38.583
Was I a good president?

38:38.585 --> 38:40.752
One of the greatest.

38:55.836 --> 38:59.137
You're back.

38:59.139 --> 39:00.973
Oh, my God. What happened to you?

39:00.976 --> 39:03.577
We need to talk.

39:08.148 --> 39:10.282
I'm so sorry that you
had to go through this.

39:10.284 --> 39:11.850
You don't ever have to apologize

39:11.852 --> 39:14.028
for your mother's actions, Lucy.

39:14.031 --> 39:15.831
You think she was telling the truth?

39:15.834 --> 39:17.200
About her love?

39:17.203 --> 39:20.638
Or that you have a target on your back?

39:20.641 --> 39:23.208
- Both.
- Yeah.

39:23.211 --> 39:25.311
To both.

39:25.314 --> 39:28.983
I won't sugarcoat this, Lucy.
Rittenhouse wants you dead.

39:28.986 --> 39:31.686
I mean, look how close
they already came.

39:31.689 --> 39:34.262
Maybe you should consider
staying off the missions.

39:34.265 --> 39:35.540
You can still brief the team

39:35.543 --> 39:38.043
- on the history before they go.
- No.

39:38.046 --> 39:39.810
Everyone else is risking their lives

39:39.813 --> 39:41.098
trying to stop Rittenhouse.

39:41.101 --> 39:43.636
There is no way that I'm
hiding in this bunker.

39:46.793 --> 39:49.327
If you were my daughter,

39:49.330 --> 39:51.831
I'd be so proud.

39:56.897 --> 39:58.493
The day I've had.

39:58.496 --> 40:00.599
Someone needs to figure
out how to put more seats

40:00.601 --> 40:02.602
- into this damn "Lifeboat."
- We're working on it.

40:02.605 --> 40:04.208
Well, work faster, 'cause next time,

40:04.211 --> 40:07.072
it won't be me who's left behind.

40:07.075 --> 40:08.970
Did you take care of the Sleeper?

40:08.973 --> 40:12.141
Yes, ma'am. All three of them.

40:12.144 --> 40:14.178
Uh, so what do we know about JFK.

40:14.181 --> 40:15.467
Uh, does he serve a second term?

40:15.470 --> 40:16.448
Does he have like ten more kids?

40:16.450 --> 40:18.215
What second term? JFK was assassinated

40:18.218 --> 40:20.009
two years into office.

40:20.012 --> 40:21.447
That's not right. I-I told him.

40:21.450 --> 40:22.798
I told him not to go to Dallas.

40:22.801 --> 40:24.931
Dallas? It happened in Austin.

40:29.065 --> 40:30.783
Guess it was just meant to be.

40:34.650 --> 40:36.295
Oh, God.

40:36.298 --> 40:38.139
Sorry.

40:40.439 --> 40:43.073
Lucy.

40:43.076 --> 40:44.509
Thank you.

40:44.511 --> 40:46.236
For what?

40:46.239 --> 40:49.240
Uh, Jessica's giving me a second chance,

40:49.243 --> 40:53.179
and she said it was 'cause of you.

40:53.182 --> 40:55.849
Well, the history that
you two have between you,

40:55.852 --> 40:57.518
it's special.

40:57.521 --> 40:59.121
And...

40:59.124 --> 41:01.858
you deserve to finally be happy, Wyatt.

41:06.387 --> 41:09.421
I have no regrets.

41:09.424 --> 41:11.725
Me neither.

41:11.728 --> 41:15.496
Well, I'll see you around the bunker.

41:15.499 --> 41:18.800
- Baby doll.
- See you around the bunker.

41:18.803 --> 41:21.304
Shweetheart.

41:36.381 --> 41:39.549
- Want one?
- Oh, no.

41:39.552 --> 41:41.599
Why didn't you get me
something I could eat?

41:41.601 --> 41:43.084
Oh, that's right, I forgot.

41:43.087 --> 41:45.683
The idea of offering a
raw carrot to an Andrew.

41:45.686 --> 41:48.097
You don't think I'm going
around panhandling for you,

41:48.100 --> 41:49.983
do you? Have one of these.

41:49.986 --> 41:51.753
Best thing in the world for you, carrots.

41:56.229 --> 41:57.695
I wish you wouldn't talk so much.

41:57.698 --> 41:59.765
Let another car get away.

41:59.768 --> 42:01.983
S-suppose nobody stops for us.

42:01.986 --> 42:03.600
He'll stop all right.

42:03.603 --> 42:05.970
It's all a matter of
knowing how to hail 'em.

42:05.973 --> 42:07.748
Oh, and you're an expert, I suppose.

42:07.751 --> 42:09.772
Expert? I'm gonna write a book about it

42:09.775 --> 42:11.708
called "The Hitchhiker's Hail."

42:11.711 --> 42:15.212
There's no end to your
accomplishments, is there?

42:15.215 --> 42:16.967
- You think it's simple, huh?
- No, no.

42:16.970 --> 42:18.475
Well, it is simple.

42:18.478 --> 42:20.111
It's all in that old thumb, see?

42:20.114 --> 42:22.114
Yeah, now, some people do it like this.

42:22.117 --> 42:23.618
Or like this.
