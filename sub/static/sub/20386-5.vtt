00:03.080 --> 00:05.080
- Hi!
- Kalimera.

00:08.720 --> 00:10.870
I think you're a bad chooser of men.

00:10.920 --> 00:13.110
- Do you?
- Mm-hm.

00:13.160 --> 00:15.310
Hm. Well, they're not my priority.

00:15.360 --> 00:19.430
Even his name is wrong. Hugh?
It's not a name, it's a question.

00:19.480 --> 00:23.510
I suspect you wouldn't be happy with
whoever was trying to court me, Spiro,

00:23.560 --> 00:27.190
because you are over-protective
of me and my family.

00:27.240 --> 00:30.750
- Will you marry Hugh?
- You can't ask that.

00:30.800 --> 00:34.160
- Why not?
- Because you're being indiscreet.

00:35.200 --> 00:38.230
You know I love the British, but
you make everything complicated.

00:38.280 --> 00:40.510
We Greeks are different.

00:40.560 --> 00:43.320
We say what's on our
mind. Important things.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.920
Why are there no gingerbread women?

00:48.880 --> 00:50.880
Hm.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.720
Mm!

00:55.480 --> 00:57.240
OK, OK!

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074

02:00.500 --> 02:01.520
I'm busy.

02:08.720 --> 02:10.720
Just give me another half hour.

02:15.360 --> 02:17.360
Mm...

02:19.800 --> 02:21.790
Always with the big entrance.

02:23.880 --> 02:25.880
When are we getting married?

02:28.120 --> 02:30.110
Oh, that's a question?

02:30.160 --> 02:33.470
Well, in your hasty way, you
forget that I never asked

02:33.520 --> 02:35.520
or even agreed to marry you.

02:38.440 --> 02:40.430
Argh!

02:40.480 --> 02:42.470
Get off!

02:42.520 --> 02:44.790
What are you bloody doing?

02:44.840 --> 02:47.990
- Ask me to marry you.
- Is this to do with me giving you the mumps?

02:48.040 --> 02:50.120
Propose to me!

02:53.360 --> 02:54.680
No!

02:55.400 --> 02:59.870
So, what is MDXCVI?

03:04.040 --> 03:06.760
- Roman numerals, Gerry.
- No!

03:08.640 --> 03:10.630
Gerry...

03:10.680 --> 03:12.470
No! Get out!

03:12.520 --> 03:13.910
Go! Go!

03:13.960 --> 03:16.590
Gerry, will you for once
concentrate on your studies?

03:16.640 --> 03:18.310
There's a falcon attacking my otter.

03:18.360 --> 03:20.110
- I don't care.
- Well, you should.

03:20.160 --> 03:22.960
Otters are dying out on Corfu
and I think she's pregnant.

03:27.320 --> 03:29.320
You are the end.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.280
That's it. No more animals or I will...

03:39.400 --> 03:41.640
.. I will beat you. Go.

03:49.840 --> 03:54.030
It... It's obvious olive oil is the
best for preserving and cooking.

03:54.080 --> 03:57.190
Butter is... is animal putrescence.

03:57.240 --> 04:00.510
Mm! Toast with jam and... oil.

04:02.060 --> 04:04.070
I'm so boring about olive oil.

04:04.120 --> 04:05.720
Hm, you are a bit.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.600
You'll never guess what
I have under my trousers.

04:11.640 --> 04:13.640
Swimming trunks.

04:28.880 --> 04:30.880
Wow...

04:39.080 --> 04:41.750
- Are you coming in?
- She doesn't go in the water.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.590
- Why not?
- She finds it undignified.

04:43.640 --> 04:47.110
- She doesn't have a swimming costume.
- She has got six pairs of shoes.

04:47.160 --> 04:48.670
Shall I answer?

04:48.720 --> 04:49.620
Come on.

04:54.040 --> 04:56.040
Quickly, come on!

04:57.200 --> 04:59.830
Right, piggy-back, everyone.
Let's do this properly.

04:59.880 --> 05:01.870
Come on, Margo!

05:01.920 --> 05:03.910
Come on, then.

05:04.060 --> 05:07.190
One... two... three!

05:10.080 --> 05:12.080
Whoo!

05:27.920 --> 05:29.910
Ah, Larry. How lovely.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.160
Oh. Let me guess what's
making you look suicidal.

05:36.120 --> 05:38.590
Hm, could it be your choice
of girlfriend, perhaps?

05:38.640 --> 05:40.470
Vasilia just tried to force me

05:40.520 --> 05:42.950
into the least romantic
proposal in history.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.160
Oh, darling.

05:46.040 --> 05:49.510
A scene as if written by PG
Wodehouse in a really bad mood.

05:49.560 --> 05:51.070
Please tell her it's over.

05:51.120 --> 05:55.550
Oh, I will. I've had enough. Just
waiting for the right moment.

05:55.600 --> 05:58.270
Mm. Or let me do it. I'd love to.

05:58.320 --> 06:00.870
No. She'd kill you.

06:00.920 --> 06:03.880
Literally. Then throw your
carcass out of the house.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.630
Ah, nature filial. How are you?

06:07.680 --> 06:11.070
Well, this is fun. But
Donald's ruining my life.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.830
He's so grumpy now.

06:12.880 --> 06:14.870
Hm. Margo's making him suffer.

06:14.920 --> 06:17.600
Because she's already been
through unrequited love.

06:19.040 --> 06:23.310
Well, I'm no expert but it seems to
me that love's a bit of a nightmare.

06:23.360 --> 06:26.430
Well, it can be because
it's so hard to find.

06:26.480 --> 06:29.270
But when you do, together, well, it's...

06:29.320 --> 06:31.390
it's powerful and beautiful.

06:31.440 --> 06:33.430
Thanks. No, I'm sure that'll be useful.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.550
I'm just off to get my pelicans.

06:35.600 --> 06:39.600
Larry! Get in the water,
man. I'll race you.

06:46.760 --> 06:48.600
Geronimo!

06:49.600 --> 06:51.470
Here I come!

06:53.080 --> 06:55.080
Go!

07:07.960 --> 07:09.590
Mrs Durrell.

07:09.640 --> 07:12.310
I saw Larry. He told
me you need the parasol.

07:12.360 --> 07:14.870
- Spiro, you are a marvel.
- I bring you shadow...

07:14.920 --> 07:18.150
but nothing can put you in the shade.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.240
Mr Halikiopoulos.

07:23.920 --> 07:27.790
- Mr Jarvis.
- Oh, listen, do try to get on.

07:27.840 --> 07:31.830
Yes, well, unlike women, men don't
feel the need to like each other.

07:31.880 --> 07:34.150
Nor do we. I much prefer men.

07:34.200 --> 07:36.990
- Oh, excellent.
- Not all men, obviously.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.150
Men and women may be different,

07:39.200 --> 07:41.790
but there's such a bond
between our two cultures.

07:41.840 --> 07:45.630
Spiro loves the British and, well,
Hugh's grandparents were Greek.

07:45.680 --> 07:48.590
The Greeks and the British
have so much in common.

07:48.640 --> 07:51.830
- Theo would have lots of examples
if he wasn't away. - Weren't away.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.870
Subjunctive. We'll study that tomorrow.

07:53.920 --> 07:57.750
The Greeks give us ancient
culture and, well, this,

07:57.800 --> 07:59.840
and we give you Shakespeare and...

08:01.680 --> 08:03.670
- Cricket?
- Yes.

08:03.720 --> 08:06.950
We play cricket in Corfu.
The only place in Greece.

08:07.000 --> 08:09.400
What makes me think you're
rather good at it, Spiro?

08:10.400 --> 08:14.870
If you'd like to bring us together,
let's have a cricket match.

08:15.520 --> 08:17.230
Greeks against the English.

08:17.280 --> 08:20.510
No, because someone will win
and the other team will be sad.

08:20.560 --> 08:23.150
- It's a sport!
- It'll be a friendly match.

08:23.200 --> 08:25.520
- For charity.
- I'll be captain.

08:26.720 --> 08:30.550
Well, all right. As long
as it's a joyful celebration

08:30.600 --> 08:32.600
of Anglo-Greek relations.

08:39.240 --> 08:40.679
- Aah!
- Aah!

08:45.240 --> 08:47.230
I will organise the cricket.

08:47.280 --> 08:50.310
Spiro, what would we do without you?

08:51.360 --> 08:52.590
How many are there in a team?

08:52.640 --> 08:54.630
Er... I don't know. 15?

08:54.680 --> 08:57.110
- Oh.
- But you said you play?

08:57.160 --> 08:59.240
No, but Hugh wanted a contest.

09:00.360 --> 09:02.310
In Chicago, I watched baseball.

09:02.360 --> 09:04.710
But I think cricket's rather complicated.

09:04.760 --> 09:08.230
You hit the ball with the big stick
and stop for cucumber sandwiches.

09:08.280 --> 09:10.040
Hm?

09:14.600 --> 09:18.110
So, who's British and can play cricket?

09:18.160 --> 09:20.150
You, me and Donald.

09:20.200 --> 09:22.590
I asked asked Captain
Creech, but he said no.

09:22.640 --> 09:24.520
And used some salty language.

09:25.560 --> 09:28.440
- Larry? - Hopeless. But
he likes the dressing up.

09:29.600 --> 09:32.440
Well, I know a few ex-pats,
but we're still short.

09:33.680 --> 09:36.350
Oh, as non-Greeks, what about Sven?

09:36.400 --> 09:39.000
And Sven's erm... friend?

09:40.760 --> 09:42.750
Can homosexuals play sport?

09:42.800 --> 09:44.950
I think they do everything we do, Leslie.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.870
Well, not everything.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.200
- No. Well, not
- everything.

09:50.880 --> 09:53.710
We must practise until we're
a tight, efficient unit.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.190
Yes, but your mother's right.

09:55.240 --> 09:57.630
This must be a relaxed
and gentlemanly contest.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.680
I suppose so.

10:00.960 --> 10:04.150
But if we lose to a bunch of
foreigners, it'll be humiliating.

10:04.200 --> 10:05.950
Yes. Can't have that.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.390
I mean, I really like Spiro,
but we British invented sport.

10:10.440 --> 10:13.830
- Yes. I look forward to winning her.
- What do you mean "her"?

10:13.880 --> 10:16.590
- What? - You said you look
forward to winning "her."

10:16.640 --> 10:18.630
- Winning
- it.

10:18.680 --> 10:20.680
The game.

10:43.800 --> 10:45.800
Oh!

11:02.720 --> 11:04.710
Good evening.

11:04.760 --> 11:06.200
Kalispera.

11:08.880 --> 11:12.310
No, don't touch me! I have
something serious to say.

11:12.360 --> 11:14.360
And don't get angry, but --

11:16.920 --> 11:19.670
- Your mouth is soft.
- That's normal.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.270
- Now --
- Make it hard.

11:21.320 --> 11:25.230
No! Now... I have enjoyed
our time together,

11:25.280 --> 11:27.150
but in the words of George Eliot,

11:27.200 --> 11:32.200
"Only in the agony of parting, do
we look into the depths of love."

11:33.200 --> 11:37.080
So you're doing, how you call
it, tittering? Twittering?

11:38.200 --> 11:43.120
- Wittering. - Stop. Eat with
me. And then we'll make love.

11:43.960 --> 11:45.480
No.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
No, I'm not going to erm...

11:49.680 --> 11:51.670
Absolutely not.

11:51.720 --> 11:53.720
No more...

11:59.400 --> 12:01.400
Oh, God...

12:16.400 --> 12:18.110
Hello, Countess.

12:18.160 --> 12:20.990
Margo! Oh, how lovely.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.030
I have missed you.

12:23.080 --> 12:26.470
Ah. Thank you. You did sack me.

12:26.520 --> 12:30.600
No! Tush, I merely asked
you not to come back.

12:31.640 --> 12:33.190
I have a favour.

12:33.240 --> 12:37.110
My mother's arranging a cricket match
between a Greek and a British team

12:37.160 --> 12:39.270
to celebrate the two
cultures or something.

12:39.320 --> 12:40.910
How intrepid.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.550
And we hoped you'd present the trophy.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.590
I'd be delighted.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.310
And provide the trophy.

12:47.360 --> 12:50.070
If you have an ornament or a
spare bowl lying around...

12:50.120 --> 12:52.110
We don't have a bean.

12:52.160 --> 12:55.990
Well, we have beans, but not much else.

12:56.040 --> 12:58.110
Oh. Mais, bien sur.

12:58.160 --> 13:01.070
And I will umpire the match.

13:01.120 --> 13:04.590
- Oh. - And I'm French, so I'm neutral.

13:04.640 --> 13:07.390
No, it won't be that sort of match.
It's all going to be very friendly.

13:07.440 --> 13:08.910
Oh-ho!

13:08.960 --> 13:13.760
If it's between Greece and Britain,
it's not going to be friendly.

13:14.920 --> 13:17.350
How can the hypotenuse
be shorter than the side?

13:17.400 --> 13:20.590
- Does it really matter how long it is?
- Yes, otherwise nothing matters.

13:20.640 --> 13:24.110
You're only cross because you like
Margo and she doesn't like you back.

13:25.360 --> 13:27.020
It's not helping, that's for sure.

13:29.320 --> 13:31.720
Well, all the men Margo likes are foreign.

13:32.800 --> 13:34.910
So you should try acting more foreign.

13:34.960 --> 13:36.750
Foreign?

13:36.800 --> 13:38.800
You know, more exotic.

13:39.840 --> 13:43.520
- You don't think I look exotic?
- Shall I bring you a mirror? - No.

13:44.520 --> 13:47.150
Well, I've been thinking about animals...

13:47.200 --> 13:49.800
- What a surprise.
- .. and what makes them exotic.

13:51.520 --> 13:53.390
And it's often how they move.

13:53.440 --> 13:58.440
For example, a very British animal
like a rabbit, moves like this.

14:02.360 --> 14:04.470
- So that's you.
- Oh.

14:04.520 --> 14:10.080
Margo might prefer something
more slinky. Like a tiger.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.040
- Raar...
- No, don't roar.

14:19.280 --> 14:21.270
I've just had the best idea.

14:21.320 --> 14:22.990
- Oh, dear.
- About love.

14:23.040 --> 14:25.630
I'm a bit of an expert now
Donald's in love with me.

14:25.680 --> 14:28.910
I honestly think he'd cut his
ear off for me like van Gogh.

14:28.960 --> 14:33.550
Oh, please don't let him do that.
Though a toe could be quite fun.

14:33.600 --> 14:34.910
Anyway...

14:34.960 --> 14:38.350
what you have to do is to
not tell Vasilia it's over.

14:38.400 --> 14:40.950
Then she won't take revenge on you or us.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.910
You just have to make her go off you.

14:42.960 --> 14:45.870
Realistically, how can
I make her go off me?

14:45.920 --> 14:47.920
I don't know.

14:49.680 --> 14:54.350
But she does hate the opposite.
What she calls "men in slippers."

14:54.400 --> 14:58.110
That mealy-mouthed diffidence
the English do so well.

14:58.160 --> 15:01.840
There. Be like that. She'll
go off you and you'll be free.

15:02.720 --> 15:06.430
Of course an 80-year-old French
woman can't umpire our cricket match!

15:06.480 --> 15:08.030
Why not? She knows the silly rules.

15:08.080 --> 15:10.310
Games can be won or lost
on an umpire's decision.

15:10.360 --> 15:12.270
It's perfect. She can
favour the Greek team

15:12.320 --> 15:14.310
because they won't be
as good as the English.

15:14.360 --> 15:16.070
That's not how you play sport!

15:16.120 --> 15:18.790
I don't want this to become tense.

15:18.840 --> 15:21.190
As much as I love Hugh,
he can be competitive.

15:21.240 --> 15:23.510
You love Hugh...

15:23.560 --> 15:26.870
No! No! It was just a turn of phrase.

15:26.920 --> 15:28.910
Stop looking at me like that.

15:28.960 --> 15:31.680
Put Thunder down, Gerry. There we are.

15:33.960 --> 15:36.350
It turns out that Spiro
can't play cricket,

15:36.400 --> 15:38.270
so you'll have to teach him, Leslie.

15:38.320 --> 15:40.470
Well, Theo likes cricket. He can do it.

15:40.520 --> 15:42.360
Theo's away.

15:43.640 --> 15:45.640
- You're very quiet, Donald.
- Sorry.

15:46.720 --> 15:50.950
Donald's been telling me how
his parents were from... Brazil.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.790
- Ah.
- Very exotic.

15:54.840 --> 15:56.550
I thought they were from Reading.

15:56.600 --> 15:59.750
Yes, erm... the Brazilian
quarter of Reading.

15:59.800 --> 16:03.030
- Reading has a Brazilian quarter?
- It's very small.

16:03.080 --> 16:05.080
- Ah.
- But very exotic.

16:06.680 --> 16:08.830
I hear you're very good
at cricket, Donald.

16:08.880 --> 16:12.120
Thank you. I do have a workable googly.

16:30.320 --> 16:34.510
Er... less of that, missy. But
can I heat you up some warm milk?

16:34.560 --> 16:36.990
I know what you're trying to do.

16:37.040 --> 16:41.510
- What? - You are scared of me so
you want to become English again.

16:41.560 --> 16:45.510
No, this is the real me. Dull as buggery.

16:45.560 --> 16:47.550
It is charming.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.830
I love you more.

16:49.880 --> 16:53.400
Are you staying with me to annoy
my mother and make Hugh jealous?

16:55.800 --> 16:57.800
Let's have warm milk together.

17:03.080 --> 17:04.560
Come in for a swim.

17:06.119 --> 17:08.790
I know you're sweating away
under there like a pig.

17:08.839 --> 17:09.990
(Please drown.)

17:10.040 --> 17:13.510
- Borrow one of my costumes.
- And even if I were happy to swim,

17:13.560 --> 17:15.390
your costumes are too racy.

17:15.440 --> 17:18.630
When you were trying to look young,
you wore really tight clothing.

17:18.680 --> 17:20.579
And remember how much you hated that.

17:21.560 --> 17:23.920
Leslie, Spiro's here for
his cricket coaching.

17:24.920 --> 17:26.920
- Come on.
- Oh, God...

17:30.200 --> 17:32.070
It'll feel daft. I shall be myself.

17:32.120 --> 17:34.670
I don't think you should,
no. That's going terribly.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.390
- You're only doing this for
selfish reasons. - Oh, I know.

17:37.440 --> 17:40.630
Now walk like an exotic big
cat who's looking for a mate.

17:40.680 --> 17:42.320
One, two, three...

18:01.360 --> 18:03.990
Margo, how is life?

18:04.040 --> 18:06.240
Are you all right?

18:07.520 --> 18:09.990
Yes, I'm amazing.

18:10.040 --> 18:12.040
Now you're frightening me.

18:21.240 --> 18:23.240
Come on, Roger!

18:38.720 --> 18:40.720
Hey...

18:50.960 --> 18:52.960
He's just jealous.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.710
Now, Spiro, as captain,
you will set your field.

18:58.760 --> 19:02.310
You'll need a slip or two,
point, gully, third man,

19:02.360 --> 19:03.870
- silly mid-on --
- Silly mid-on?

19:03.920 --> 19:05.720
Yes, that's where the goat's standing.

19:06.200 --> 19:08.310
Silly mid-off is the opposite.

19:08.360 --> 19:10.270
The other goat's at cover.

19:10.320 --> 19:12.270
So they stand around the grass?

19:12.320 --> 19:14.390
- Pitch, yes.
- The ball's thrown?

19:14.440 --> 19:17.150
- Well, bowled.
- And we whack it!

19:17.200 --> 19:18.350
Yes, yes.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.950
But you're missing out on all
the subtleties of the game.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.430
Subtleties are for people
with too much spare time.

19:23.480 --> 19:26.110
- I go now.
- Yes, yes. Sorry, Lugar.

19:26.160 --> 19:28.560
I don't think we're ready
for actual play, are we?

19:29.600 --> 19:31.300
Haven't seen my feet for six weeks.

19:32.560 --> 19:34.630
You know you're wearing odd shoes?

19:34.680 --> 19:36.670
No!

19:36.720 --> 19:38.710
Oh, how amusing.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.540
Well, I try my best.

19:44.240 --> 19:46.230
And you and Hugh?

19:46.280 --> 19:49.710
As Larry might say, is it
still Sense & Sensibility

19:49.760 --> 19:52.950
or are you edging towards
Wuthering Heights?

19:54.880 --> 19:56.640
Did you not hear the question?

19:57.800 --> 20:01.270
Ah. So, you know everything now.

20:01.320 --> 20:04.510
Yes. You get in, you get
out, you shake it all about.

20:04.560 --> 20:08.710
I've only found six players,
but that's enough to win, huh?

20:08.760 --> 20:11.030
- Erm... - Perhaps we
should cancel the match.

20:11.080 --> 20:14.470
No, it's all arranged. ~

20:18.520 --> 20:21.670
Has it struck you that
if Spiro wasn't married,

20:21.720 --> 20:24.560
this would look like an
old-fashioned jousting match?

20:25.640 --> 20:28.030
I need to telegram Theo
to come back early.

20:28.080 --> 20:31.870
- Why? - Because without his
help the Greeks will be thrashed,

20:31.920 --> 20:34.420
the British will be hated
and it'll all be my fault.

20:37.820 --> 20:38.680
Owzat!

20:45.460 --> 20:47.980
Dropped again. Quickly, come on.

20:49.900 --> 20:52.170
Poor. Do ten press-ups.

20:52.220 --> 20:55.850
On your knees. Sven, where are you going?

20:55.900 --> 20:57.900
Hm, I'm just...

20:59.700 --> 21:00.590
Larry, in.

21:01.740 --> 21:03.730
In!

21:03.780 --> 21:06.370
Louisa, you have spawned an ogre.

21:06.420 --> 21:08.170
- Hm.
- Take that one.

21:08.220 --> 21:10.690
- Aagh! - Get your head
in the game, Larry.

21:10.740 --> 21:12.930
Well, thank you for playing.

21:12.980 --> 21:16.570
You know it's supposed to be a celebration
of European harmony, don't you?

21:16.620 --> 21:20.450
- Yes.
- Watch this. See?

21:20.500 --> 21:23.090
It's lovely to see you
with... with your lodger.

21:23.140 --> 21:25.450
Now switch. Different hand.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.490
I'm so happy for you both.

21:27.540 --> 21:30.370
Our story is that Viggo
has a woman in Naxos

21:30.420 --> 21:33.250
and a wife back in Trollhattan.

21:33.300 --> 21:35.450
I'm sorry you have to have a story.

21:35.500 --> 21:37.050
- Larry!
- Argh!

21:38.100 --> 21:40.490
Hey! ~

21:40.540 --> 21:42.690
Do you want to run and get it?

21:42.740 --> 21:44.570
Yep.

21:44.620 --> 21:46.620
I'll be right there!

21:53.380 --> 21:55.260
- Sven!
- Huge.

22:03.700 --> 22:05.570
He knows it's not 'Huge', doesn't he?

22:05.620 --> 22:09.570
Yes. You know the Swedes.
Can never resist a joke.

22:11.660 --> 22:13.650
How are you?

22:13.700 --> 22:17.330
All the better for seeing you.
Rather nervous about this cricket.

22:17.380 --> 22:19.760
Oh, don't be. It's just a bit of fun.

22:19.810 --> 22:20.530
Catch it!

22:21.580 --> 22:24.050
Who's got it? Somebody catch it!

22:24.100 --> 22:26.690
- Mine, mine, mine!
- Yeah. Well done, Sven.

22:26.740 --> 22:28.620
Back in a circle, boys. Larry...

22:29.780 --> 22:31.650
- Henry I.
- No.

22:31.700 --> 22:33.250
- Geoffrey.
- No such king.

22:33.300 --> 22:36.890
- Edmund the... Tiny?
- You will stay behind till you've learned

22:36.940 --> 22:39.970
who succeeded William the Conqueror
and all subsequent monarchs.

22:40.020 --> 22:42.250
I know I got it wrong before,

22:42.300 --> 22:44.810
but I really do know
how to win Margo over.

22:44.860 --> 22:47.530
Oh? And what are you gonna make me do now?

22:47.580 --> 22:49.370
Dance like an elephant?

22:49.420 --> 22:52.850
No, you need to look exotic. Get a tan.

22:52.900 --> 22:56.130
Margo only agreed to come to
Corfu so she could sunbathe.

23:00.380 --> 23:02.610
Oh, and she loves that tanned film star.

23:02.660 --> 23:04.650
What's his name? Alan something.

23:04.700 --> 23:06.700
Al Jolson?

23:32.140 --> 23:34.140
Erm...

23:38.980 --> 23:41.130
You don't want to kill anything, do you?

23:41.180 --> 23:42.940
You just like company.

23:50.300 --> 23:52.300
Come on...

23:57.300 --> 23:59.300
Ah!

24:04.380 --> 24:06.370
My turn to be in love.

24:10.260 --> 24:12.260
~

24:19.180 --> 24:21.180
~

24:25.740 --> 24:27.530
- ~
- ~

24:27.580 --> 24:29.580

24:36.940 --> 24:37.970
~

24:38.020 --> 24:40.420
- ~
- ~

24:43.460 --> 24:45.460
Hello, Miss Durrells!

24:46.500 --> 24:49.170
Shall I move the horse
so you can see better?

24:49.220 --> 24:51.610
Oh, no... no. I didn't
want to interrupt you.

24:51.660 --> 24:53.900
Don't worry. It's going splendidly.

24:55.260 --> 24:57.250
I think we're like WC Grace.

24:57.300 --> 24:59.300
I think it's WG Grace.

25:04.180 --> 25:07.930
I'm sorry, Spiro, I really think
we ought to call off the match.

25:07.980 --> 25:09.980
No.

25:29.260 --> 25:32.340
Thank you. The cavalry.

25:33.620 --> 25:35.090
Mrs Durrell.

25:35.140 --> 25:37.970
I received your telegram and
left my conference at once.

25:38.020 --> 25:39.370
Oh, I'm so sorry, Theo.

25:39.420 --> 25:41.690
Oh, no. Five days debating the thermocycle

25:41.740 --> 25:44.130
of the genus's habitation
patterns are more than enough.

25:44.180 --> 25:48.650
And when else will I have the
chance to help a dear friend

25:48.700 --> 25:51.610
and save Greece's national pride?

25:53.700 --> 25:58.560
~

25:59.940 --> 26:02.290
- Look away, Miss Durrell.
- Oh...

26:02.340 --> 26:04.340
~

26:10.100 --> 26:11.850
Spiro...

26:11.900 --> 26:13.900
Lots to do.

26:21.620 --> 26:23.610
You fried your face.

26:23.660 --> 26:26.890
No. Just a touch of sun, you know?

26:26.940 --> 26:28.940
Oh, Donald. Sit down.

26:33.260 --> 26:35.660
I didn't mean do it all in one day.

26:37.580 --> 26:41.540
I used to overdo the sun, too,
before I conquered my vanity.

26:44.660 --> 26:47.300
- Oh, that's better.
- He did it for Margo.

26:47.860 --> 26:50.890
Oh, what an absolute nitwit!

26:50.940 --> 26:52.940
I'm sorry, Mrs Durrell.

27:18.180 --> 27:20.330
- Sven. - Huge. - Welcome. - Thank you.

27:20.380 --> 27:22.370
- Viggo.
- Viggo, welcome.

27:22.420 --> 27:24.060
Hi.

27:24.460 --> 27:28.380
Let's have a look here.
Let's have a look...

27:30.340 --> 27:34.370
A-ha! The English secret
weapon, two deep-field catchers.

27:34.420 --> 27:36.780
- Mascots.
- Remind me, which is which?

27:37.820 --> 27:39.810
Pelican and Peli-can't.

27:39.860 --> 27:43.530
So, you're playing, Gerry.
Hurrah! Do you bat or bowl?

27:43.580 --> 27:45.850
No. No, what's the other one?

27:45.900 --> 27:48.860
- Field? - Yes, yes. No, I
don't do that one, either.

27:50.140 --> 27:52.530
Theo, I really think our
otter's pregnant this time.

27:52.580 --> 27:53.570
That's so exciting!

27:55.120 --> 27:56.970
I'm sorry, Gerry.

27:57.020 --> 28:00.220
I fear my team misunderstood
my suggestion that we warm up.

28:01.260 --> 28:03.250
~

28:03.300 --> 28:05.300
~

28:07.540 --> 28:09.450
Let's hear thigh hit hands!

28:09.500 --> 28:11.290
Higher and higher thighs!

28:11.340 --> 28:15.650
Now, I want to be treated exactly
like everyone else. No fuss.

28:15.700 --> 28:17.410
Thank you. We have a lot to do.

28:17.460 --> 28:21.490
Though I would like to start
with a glass of bubbly.

28:21.540 --> 28:23.090
Whatever's at hand.

28:23.140 --> 28:28.570
Now, I have brought a trophy
which I thought appropriate.

28:28.620 --> 28:32.060
It captures the spirit of combat.

28:39.820 --> 28:42.130
- Sven, bend more at the knees.
- Good advice.

28:42.180 --> 28:44.580
Everyone! Bend more at
the knees, as Skip says!

28:45.780 --> 28:48.450
Who are you cheering
for? Greece or England?

28:48.500 --> 28:50.980
Or are you just cheering for yourself?

28:52.660 --> 28:54.660
England.

28:59.340 --> 29:01.330
How long we have been together?

29:01.380 --> 29:04.730
Three months. Yes.

29:04.780 --> 29:07.660
- Right, Leslie, your turn.
- Aye-aye.

29:11.580 --> 29:13.100
Life is short.

29:20.900 --> 29:22.900
Time!

29:32.020 --> 29:35.690
Now, this is a game, not
a war by other means.

29:35.740 --> 29:38.010
- I agree.
- Me, too.

29:38.060 --> 29:41.010
We're here to celebrate the
fact that we as a family

29:41.060 --> 29:43.210
came here to live and we were welcomed

29:43.260 --> 29:46.940
and we love, and we feel
loved, by our Greek hosts.

29:48.940 --> 29:51.260
- Heads or tails?
- Heads.

29:56.820 --> 30:00.700
My word is final, whether
I'm right or wrong.

30:01.980 --> 30:03.260
Put it there.

30:05.660 --> 30:07.650
You will go to prison.

30:07.700 --> 30:09.700
Oh.

30:14.460 --> 30:16.460
Come on, England!

30:18.940 --> 30:20.460
Everyone walking in.

30:30.260 --> 30:32.260
~

30:33.820 --> 30:38.140
- Line and length, Leslie. Line
and length. - Aye-aye, Skip.

30:44.460 --> 30:46.460
Play.

30:55.100 --> 30:57.170
Larry! Larry, wake up!

30:57.220 --> 30:58.780
Larry!

31:00.660 --> 31:04.380
Yes! ~

31:06.980 --> 31:08.970
- Larry, to me!
- Come on, come on!

31:09.020 --> 31:11.020
Time's passing!

31:32.260 --> 31:34.260
Cup of tea, Vasilia?

31:34.980 --> 31:36.140
No.

31:41.820 --> 31:43.570
- Howzat!
- What?

31:43.620 --> 31:45.700
LBW? LB! Come on!

31:48.300 --> 31:50.290
- Yes!
- No!

31:50.340 --> 31:51.060
I cleared it!

31:55.300 --> 31:57.610
- ~ - On your way, mate. On your way.

31:57.660 --> 31:59.570
Yes, it was plumb. Goodbye!

31:59.620 --> 32:01.930
That is the last time I treat the British.

32:01.980 --> 32:05.850
And the French! Get sick! Die!

32:05.900 --> 32:07.890
Sportsmanship...

32:07.940 --> 32:09.050
~

32:09.100 --> 32:11.100
Well, that's my weekend ruined.

32:13.160 --> 32:14.650
Such rudeness!

32:14.900 --> 32:17.100
Have my armchair sent on.

32:22.940 --> 32:25.260
Right. My turn.

32:37.500 --> 32:39.500
- Wrong end.
- What?

32:40.780 --> 32:42.770
Oh, I beg your pardon.

32:42.820 --> 32:44.980
Oh, I feel like a doctor!

32:46.620 --> 32:48.530
- Hello, Miss Durrells.
- Oh, hello.

32:48.580 --> 32:50.570
Middle, please.

32:50.620 --> 32:52.620
The middle? Middle of what?

33:13.060 --> 33:15.050
My car! My car!

33:15.100 --> 33:17.860
- You... You did that deliberately!
- Why did he sing?

33:48.900 --> 33:52.770
Start off as a predator,
end up as a friend.

33:52.820 --> 33:54.820
~

33:58.380 --> 34:00.210
Come on! Come on!

34:00.260 --> 34:02.260
Bowl a bouncer at him.

34:04.020 --> 34:06.170
No, I don't think so.
He's too inexperienced.

34:06.220 --> 34:09.980
But he cheated. He's forfeited
his right to honourable treatment.

34:10.980 --> 34:12.980
You... just...

34:15.500 --> 34:17.500
I love this game!

34:20.219 --> 34:22.210
I'm waiting for you!

34:22.260 --> 34:24.780
Wait. Wait, Hugh...

34:34.739 --> 34:36.730
Step back, step back, step back!

34:41.100 --> 34:43.929
Spiro? Spiro, Spiro...

34:43.980 --> 34:45.460
~

34:45.980 --> 34:47.570
I am so sorry.

34:47.620 --> 34:51.850
I mean, it is normal
to bowl to intimidate.

34:51.900 --> 34:54.699
Well, try that telling that
to Spiro's wife and children.

34:56.219 --> 34:57.780
~

35:00.420 --> 35:02.570
- Spiro. Spiro. - Spiro? - Spiro...

35:02.620 --> 35:05.260
I will kill that son of a bitch...

35:29.180 --> 35:33.570
See? That's what happens when you
play with what is basically a rock.

35:33.620 --> 35:36.140
Larry, I don't want to be with you.

35:40.020 --> 35:42.580
Well... if you're erm...

35:43.420 --> 35:44.540
If you're sure?

35:47.620 --> 35:50.890
Come on, everyone. Let's not look
like we're at a cantankerous wedding.

35:50.940 --> 35:52.940
Mingle.

35:55.500 --> 35:57.650
Come on, darling. You come and sit with...

35:57.700 --> 36:00.020
Er... go sit with Yorgos over here.

36:01.280 --> 36:03.100
There we are. There's a good boy.

36:04.140 --> 36:06.140
Come on. Mingle, everyone.

36:08.140 --> 36:09.770
That's better.

36:09.820 --> 36:13.370
And when we return after
tea, underarm bowling only.

36:50.060 --> 36:53.250
Listen, I don't know what you're
saying, but it sounds quite mean.

36:54.300 --> 36:55.290
Oh, darling.

36:55.340 --> 36:58.460
Oh, God. I'm sorry, I --
Oh, sorry. Sorry, sorry...

37:03.140 --> 37:03.740
Right!

37:20.660 --> 37:25.170
I tried so hard to make this a
happy day and you've ruined it!

37:25.220 --> 37:26.970
Oh!

37:27.020 --> 37:29.020
This is your fault!

38:05.880 --> 38:10.870
- Henry VIII.
- Erm... Edward VI, 1547 to 1553.

38:10.920 --> 38:16.750
- And Richard I?
- Succeeded by... King John,

38:16.800 --> 38:19.400
1199 to... was it 1216?

38:20.600 --> 38:24.160
Well done, Gerry. I think we're
finally getting somewhere.

38:27.800 --> 38:29.800
I think that's the future, Thunder.

38:46.040 --> 38:48.030
Thank you for coming.

38:48.080 --> 38:51.030
- I... I didn't want --
- I just needed to clear the air.

38:51.080 --> 38:54.030
There's nothing worse than
bad air on a small island.

38:54.080 --> 38:55.550
No, there is.

38:55.600 --> 38:58.500
The knowledge that you're not
with the person you should be.

39:00.640 --> 39:02.710
This is all about Vasilia.

39:02.760 --> 39:05.830
I didn't kiss her, she
kissed me so you'd see.

39:05.880 --> 39:07.870
You're a congenital bachelor.

39:07.920 --> 39:09.910
Let's be friends, it's just as good.

39:09.960 --> 39:11.960
You know that's not true.

39:13.040 --> 39:18.880
For months, I've fallen asleep
with you brimming in my head.

39:20.040 --> 39:21.640
And woken with you still there.

39:22.080 --> 39:24.510
I... I rush to see you

39:24.560 --> 39:27.630
and have to pretend I'm
just casually dropping in

39:27.680 --> 39:29.840
because I don't want to frighten you away.

39:32.240 --> 39:34.230
Beware men with silver tongues.

39:34.280 --> 39:36.280
I mean it.

39:37.280 --> 39:39.270
Thanks to you...

39:39.320 --> 39:43.360
I am ten times the man I
was when we first met.

39:47.600 --> 39:49.600
So that's how you feel?

39:51.560 --> 39:54.350
- Shall I have my go now?
- Yes. Yes, please.

39:54.400 --> 39:56.400
Erm...

39:58.520 --> 40:04.270
You are a Prince Charming, but charm
is for impressionable princesses

40:04.320 --> 40:06.600
and I'm a rather sceptical
widow, I'm afraid.

40:08.640 --> 40:12.150
You see, I need... soul.

40:12.200 --> 40:14.190
And heart.

40:14.240 --> 40:17.640
Me, too. That's why we need each other.

40:19.080 --> 40:22.720
Oh, we will be magnificent together.

40:24.360 --> 40:26.350
You are a marvel.

40:26.400 --> 40:30.950
And I will love you and
cherish your children,

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
and never leave you.

40:35.840 --> 40:37.840
Please be with me.

40:39.120 --> 40:41.520
And come back with me to live in England.

40:47.280 --> 40:49.280
Enough. It's playtime.

40:51.920 --> 40:53.550
- Er...
- Race to that buoy!

40:53.600 --> 40:55.600
No! No more competing.

40:57.320 --> 40:59.320
What are you wearing under that?

41:00.880 --> 41:02.950
It's a swimming costume, obviously.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.960
I was merely waiting to
find a style that suited me.

41:07.200 --> 41:09.040
Why is Donald looking so attractive?

41:09.640 --> 41:11.720
His sunburn gone brown.

41:17.400 --> 41:20.240
- You look positively
Mediterranean. - Do I?

41:22.400 --> 41:26.230
I'm... finding you rather attractive.

41:26.280 --> 41:29.830
How superficial are you that you
only say that because I've got a tan?

41:29.880 --> 41:33.990
- Eh? - I'm a complex
and intelligent person.

41:34.040 --> 41:36.960
And you should like me
for that or not at all.

41:45.460 --> 41:48.430
Mrs Durrells, your missing child.

41:48.480 --> 41:53.240
The prodigal returns. Time to come home.

41:59.320 --> 42:01.310
Oh, Larry. It's been...

42:01.360 --> 42:04.400
Well, it's been actually rather
easy without you being here.

42:06.080 --> 42:08.080
Quickly, come on!

42:09.160 --> 42:11.160
Wait for me!

42:12.920 --> 42:14.240
How's your head?

42:15.000 --> 42:17.400
The doctor said that I can take it off.

42:18.240 --> 42:19.860
But I feel like a pirate.

42:23.160 --> 42:27.150
I'm not going to swim. I'm not sure
this is the right style for me.

42:27.200 --> 42:31.560
But believe me when I say you would
look good swimming in a floppy sack.

42:51.320 --> 42:54.080
- You're going to get
your hair wet. - Ah...

43:05.440 --> 43:07.510
The height of fashion in 1910!

43:08.060 --> 43:09.060
Careful!

43:11.040 --> 43:14.840
- In you come!
- Well, I say, it's warmer...

43:26.460 --> 43:28.310
Why didn't I do this before?

43:32.600 --> 43:34.590
Gerry!

43:37.840 --> 43:39.840
Hey!

43:41.640 --> 43:43.640
Gerry! Gerry!

43:49.160 --> 43:52.630
- Are you moving back in, Larry?
- Yes. I'm afraid I'll need my room.

43:52.680 --> 43:54.550
- So you split up with Vasilia?
- Yes.

43:54.600 --> 43:56.510
Larry? Oof!

43:56.560 --> 44:01.750
I feel like one of those soldiers
who prayed for the end of the war
and then can't help missing it.

44:01.800 --> 44:03.680
Hm, nice tan. Very sexy.

44:04.920 --> 44:07.240
Let's go play cricket. I
want to see that googly.

44:24.360 --> 44:25.720
Bloody hell.

44:27.880 --> 44:29.990
Haven't said how bad I feel.

44:30.040 --> 44:32.270
The cricket was a beautiful idea and I --

44:32.320 --> 44:35.190
- It's fine. Really, Spiro.
- No, you're right.

44:35.240 --> 44:37.470
We're all together in this world.

44:37.520 --> 44:40.150
Greeks, English. Even the Turks.

44:42.240 --> 44:46.240
Whether you are from Corfu,
Bournemouth, Chicago...

44:47.240 --> 44:50.470
.. or the Indian Ocean, like
me and my fellow pirates.

44:54.200 --> 44:56.200
You're very special to me.

45:18.320 --> 45:20.710
Why does Spiro harbour such
animosity towards Hugh?

45:20.760 --> 45:24.470
Er... because he's English
and he seems arrogant.

45:24.520 --> 45:27.760
No, Spiro adores the English
and he knows Hugh's a good man.

45:29.960 --> 45:31.960
Maybe it's because Spiro loves you.

45:33.680 --> 45:35.840
- Utter twaddle.
- Sorry. No, of course it is.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.960
I just met the rose beetle
man. Do you know him?

45:44.960 --> 45:47.470
- Come back! - I'm looking for
a book on how to give birth!

45:49.020 --> 45:50.470
You have to come with me.

45:50.520 --> 45:52.230
Do you realise what
you're asking me to do?

45:52.280 --> 45:55.310
- This is about Spiro, isn't it?
- Keep going!

45:55.360 --> 45:58.360
Let me present the man I want to
spend the rest of my life with.

45:59.720 --> 46:02.750
I've spent the whole day
just missing everything.
