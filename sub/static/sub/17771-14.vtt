WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:04.917
(Ryan) Previously, on Mech X-4...

00:05.000 --> 00:08.625
We have to stop Harper. He keeps
all the important stuff locked up here.

00:08.709 --> 00:10.792
(Ryan)
He doesn't know that we're on to him.

00:13.625 --> 00:16.041
(Ryan) I know where the ooze is!
It's under the school!

00:17.709 --> 00:18.583
(gasps)

00:20.959 --> 00:22.125
(device scanning)

00:22.208 --> 00:23.250
I'm scanning for ooze.

00:23.333 --> 00:25.458
And Operation Tiger Shark is in progress.

00:25.542 --> 00:28.834
I'm done with the North Campus,
but I still haven't reached the perimeter

00:28.917 --> 00:30.208
of the school's ooze pocket.

00:30.291 --> 00:32.542
Keep measuring and move
to the science building.

00:32.625 --> 00:33.750
I'll do the same.

00:33.834 --> 00:35.583
Why tiger shark?

00:35.667 --> 00:37.458
(Harris) And why are you lying
on the ground?

00:37.542 --> 00:39.625
(Spyder) Because tigers are cool
and sharks are cool,

00:39.709 --> 00:41.542
and I got bored scanning and took a nap.

00:41.625 --> 00:44.542
Why do we have to measure the ooze,
can't we just zap it or something?

00:44.625 --> 00:46.834
But that would cave in the school.

00:46.917 --> 00:50.291
Wait... so you're saying it's a win-win?

00:50.375 --> 00:54.500
We need accurate measurements, so far,
it looks like the worst case scenario.

00:55.542 --> 00:58.667
There's so much ooze,
even if we poured all our weapons into it,

00:58.750 --> 01:00.041
it wouldn't be enough to get it out.

01:00.125 --> 01:02.458
So, it's like when I take a whiz
in a school pool,

01:02.542 --> 01:03.875
I'm not doin' any real damage?

01:03.959 --> 01:06.333
Gross... but accurate.

01:06.417 --> 01:09.250
You know, I'm the reason
they use twice the chlorine now?

01:09.333 --> 01:10.542
(Harris) Again, gross.

01:10.625 --> 01:12.083
(sighs) We can neutralize it

01:12.166 --> 01:15.000
with the antidote that cured me
when I was ooze-infected.

01:15.083 --> 01:17.125
I just need to know how much to produce.

01:17.208 --> 01:21.041
Dude... this ooze pocket
is gigantic. Hold on...

01:21.792 --> 01:22.625
Aah!

01:22.709 --> 01:25.417
-(whistle blowing)
-Eat it, jocko!

01:25.500 --> 01:29.125
Spyder! We're in the middle of practice.

01:29.208 --> 01:31.291
You do you. I do me.

01:32.458 --> 01:34.041
-Aah!
-Aah!

01:34.125 --> 01:36.333
I've never seen a kid
take a hit like that.

01:36.417 --> 01:37.458
You gotta join the team.

01:37.542 --> 01:39.417
-What... kinda grades do I need?
-Passing.

01:39.500 --> 01:40.959
I'm out.

01:48.750 --> 01:51.959
Ooze pocket is over a mile deep
and almost three miles wide.

01:55.583 --> 01:56.875
This is Clawboon.

01:56.959 --> 01:59.250
Right, and we kicked its butt.

01:59.333 --> 02:03.458
Yeah, but... based on the amount of ooze
it decomposed into when we beat it,

02:03.542 --> 02:05.333
this is how big Clawboon would be

02:05.417 --> 02:07.709
if it was made of all the ooze
under the school.

02:07.792 --> 02:11.291
Whoa... that thing is huge!
It could destroy the city!

02:11.375 --> 02:13.458
(Harris) It's almost the size
of Bay City itself.

02:13.542 --> 02:16.125
Something that size can destroy the world.

02:16.208 --> 02:17.917
That's not gonna happen.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.917
We gotta get to it before Harper does.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.417
Tonight, when the school's
completely empty...

02:22.500 --> 02:25.333
we're gonna destroy
every last drop of that ooze.

02:26.750 --> 02:28.083
(theme music playing)

02:47.583 --> 02:49.208
(Spyder rummaging)

02:50.250 --> 02:51.875
Aha! Found it!

02:51.959 --> 02:52.834
-Ryan?
-Huh?

02:52.917 --> 02:55.000
Ry-- Oh! Wow. Okay, yeah.

02:55.083 --> 02:58.208
This will interface Mech X-3's giant drill

02:58.291 --> 03:00.458
with Mech X-4's systems.

03:00.542 --> 03:03.625
Oh, great. And then we can drill a hole
down to the ooze pocket,

03:03.709 --> 03:05.041
and Harris can drop the antidote

03:05.125 --> 03:06.750
he's been working on, and then, boom!

03:06.834 --> 03:08.709
Bye bye, monsters. Sorry, Seth.

03:08.792 --> 03:11.333
Now is not the time
to get cocky, Ryan. Okay?

03:11.417 --> 03:14.250
What? Well, Harper doesn't even know

03:14.333 --> 03:16.750
that we jacked his mind
for the location of the ooze.

03:16.834 --> 03:19.041
Ha-ha! Yeah!

03:19.125 --> 03:20.166
Yeah.

03:20.250 --> 03:23.041
Doesn't matter. Okay?
Harper is very, very dangerous,

03:23.125 --> 03:24.417
do not underestimate him.

03:24.500 --> 03:26.542
Okay... okay.

03:26.625 --> 03:31.041
Hey, why did you build a giant drill arm
for Mech X-3 anyway?

03:31.125 --> 03:32.083
Ha-ha!

03:32.166 --> 03:35.375
Yeah! Uh... I don't know,
I like to be prepared.

03:35.458 --> 03:38.625
But, without a technopath...
(grunts) none of that's worked.

03:38.709 --> 03:40.000
Obvi.

03:40.959 --> 03:44.458
-Yeah...
-So... that's when you started

03:44.542 --> 03:47.083
trying to create a technopath, right?

03:47.166 --> 03:49.458
Ah! Exactly! I started doing
those experimental trials

03:49.542 --> 03:51.333
all those years ago. Yeah...

03:51.417 --> 03:53.000
Wait, wait... what?

03:53.792 --> 03:56.083
You experimented on me as a baby?

03:56.750 --> 04:00.917
No, no, of course not! No...
I experimented on your birth parents.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.792
I--

04:02.875 --> 04:05.875
-That doesn't sound much better, does it?
-No, not really.

04:05.959 --> 04:07.125
No... look, um...

04:07.208 --> 04:10.041
everyone involved was a volunteer, okay?

04:10.125 --> 04:12.166
No one developed any powers, but...

04:12.250 --> 04:14.917
somehow your parents
passed them on to you...

04:15.000 --> 04:17.709
-wherever they are.
-(objects clattering)

04:17.792 --> 04:20.667
So you don't know... where they are.

04:20.750 --> 04:22.125
(objects clattering)

04:23.583 --> 04:25.917
Look, I've been a little bit
out of the loop... okay, kid?

04:26.000 --> 04:28.583
I mean... I was being held prisoner.

04:28.667 --> 04:32.583
When I went in,
Tay Tay was reintroducing the crop top.

04:32.667 --> 04:34.834
Yeah... I don't know what that is.

04:34.917 --> 04:36.792
Really? Wow.

04:36.875 --> 04:39.875
That's really not that old a reference.
Wow, that makes me feel ancient.

04:39.959 --> 04:41.250
Look, Ryan... (clears throat)

04:41.333 --> 04:44.458
Your parents didn't abandon you,
if that's what you were wondering.

04:44.542 --> 04:46.750
Well, yeah, it was... a little.

04:46.834 --> 04:48.917
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...

04:49.000 --> 04:51.375
they were-- they were convinced
someone was after them.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.750
And you. Because of your power.

04:53.834 --> 04:56.667
Was it... was it Harper?

04:56.750 --> 04:58.291
Probably.

04:58.375 --> 05:02.000
Yeah, I mean... he knew
I was working on a way to stop him.

05:02.750 --> 05:06.375
Your parents went into hiding.
But they were afraid you'd get hurt

05:06.458 --> 05:09.667
if Harper found them, so...
they had me put you up for adoption,

05:09.750 --> 05:12.083
because they wanted you to be safe...

05:12.166 --> 05:13.709
and have a normal life.

05:17.041 --> 05:18.500
Harper!

05:18.583 --> 05:20.166
(clattering)

05:24.917 --> 05:26.917
I kinda liked Seth... you know?

05:29.041 --> 05:32.333
He even made it seem like
he wanted to be a part of our family.

05:34.667 --> 05:38.917
But in one way or another...
he was just trying to destroy it.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.709
I wish... I knew what it all means.

05:41.792 --> 05:44.041
Look... I know two things.

05:44.125 --> 05:47.291
Okay, one, your birth parents
loved you very much.

05:47.375 --> 05:50.458
Two... they'd be very proud of you.

05:50.542 --> 05:52.542
I mean... you're a hero.

05:52.625 --> 05:56.291
Ryan. Things you've done...
people you've saved.

05:57.917 --> 06:00.000
I'm proud of you, too.

06:01.250 --> 06:05.792
Okay. So, after I install
this giant drill-- Ahh!

06:05.875 --> 06:07.375
Yeah! I'm okay! I'm okay!

06:07.458 --> 06:08.500
What's next?

06:08.583 --> 06:10.917
Well... I'm a hero, Leo.

06:11.875 --> 06:14.709
And I'm gonna do what any hero does
with a secret identity...

06:14.792 --> 06:16.417
I'm gonna lie to my mom.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.041
I can't believe I go
to the Northwest Food Fest this weekend.

06:22.125 --> 06:23.834
I don't even remember signing up,

06:23.917 --> 06:26.375
I just magically got this email
saying I was in.

06:26.458 --> 06:28.834
Yep! Ha... magic!

06:28.917 --> 06:30.667
Oh, I-- I should call and let Seth know.

06:30.750 --> 06:34.417
-Oh, no need...
-No, no, we already, uh, talked to him.

06:34.500 --> 06:36.667
Yeah, and w-- we will see him later, so...

06:36.750 --> 06:38.875
Okay, well, uh, have fun at the movie.

06:38.959 --> 06:41.375
-Curfew, homework, kisses.
-(Ryan) Homework, kisses.

06:41.458 --> 06:43.208
-Exactly.
-Got it. Hey, Mom...

06:44.583 --> 06:45.834
Stay safe, okay?

06:47.125 --> 06:50.250
Okay. It's okay, Ry-Guy,
it's just a couple of days.

06:50.333 --> 06:52.625
Try and toughen him up
a little bit while I'm gone, okay?

06:52.709 --> 06:55.083
-Yeah.
-(laughs) Okay. Bye.

07:01.333 --> 07:03.959
(Mark) Way to use your power
to get her into that festival.

07:04.041 --> 07:06.000
(Ryan) And out of town.

07:06.083 --> 07:08.125
You ready to destroy some ooze?

07:08.208 --> 07:09.583
You know it.

07:12.875 --> 07:15.041
-Sir?
-You know, it's funny.

07:15.125 --> 07:18.709
Crisis really is the mother of invention.

07:18.792 --> 07:20.834
I'm not sure I understand.

07:20.917 --> 07:26.125
I sent mindless monsters
against a robot... with a mind.

07:26.208 --> 07:27.875
And... we lost.

07:28.917 --> 07:30.875
Makes me wonder... what would happen

07:30.959 --> 07:33.125
if I could control the monsters...

07:33.208 --> 07:34.709
with my mind?

07:34.792 --> 07:37.750
Our surveillance teams did tell us
that the kids are going after the gel

07:37.834 --> 07:39.041
under the school tonight.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.917
Excellent. One more thing.

07:46.750 --> 07:48.208
(computer whirring)

07:48.291 --> 07:49.375
(mutters under breath)

07:49.458 --> 07:50.667
Ah.

07:52.583 --> 07:54.208
This is for you.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.083
Chameleon DNA?

07:58.166 --> 08:00.875
With a... little twist.

08:08.166 --> 08:09.959
(Ryan) Are you sure
nobody's at the school?

08:10.041 --> 08:12.792
At four in the morning?
The only person that'd still be there

08:12.875 --> 08:15.041
is Harris and... he's here.

08:16.375 --> 08:19.417
All right. Activating drill!

08:27.458 --> 08:29.250
(drill whirring)

08:29.333 --> 08:31.208
It sounds like we're at the dentist.

08:31.291 --> 08:32.333
I would not know.

08:33.083 --> 08:34.125
All still baby teeth.

08:36.291 --> 08:37.417
(grunts)

08:55.000 --> 08:56.583
-(groans)
-(groans)

08:56.667 --> 08:58.125
(Spyder) The antidote!

09:05.083 --> 09:07.125
-(groans, gasps)
-(alarm sounding)

09:07.208 --> 09:09.125
We lost the antidote! It's gone!

09:09.208 --> 09:10.500
Something just hit us!

09:12.375 --> 09:14.041
I don't see anything!

09:15.041 --> 09:16.917
(buzzing)

09:22.875 --> 09:23.959
(buzzing continues)

09:24.041 --> 09:25.667
Wasp.

09:28.875 --> 09:29.959
Wasp!

09:35.750 --> 09:37.375
Invisible wasp!

09:37.458 --> 09:39.917
Worse. Worse!

09:40.000 --> 09:42.250
-(grunts)
-(groans)

09:44.083 --> 09:45.667
-(grunts)
-(groans)

09:47.000 --> 09:48.166
Ah!

09:49.375 --> 09:51.583
Ooh, that was cooler
than I thought it would be.

09:51.667 --> 09:54.125
How do we fight something
that's invisible?

09:54.208 --> 09:57.000
I can recalibrate the sensors
to work like sonar.

09:57.083 --> 10:00.291
We won't be able to see the monster,
but... we'll know where it is.

10:07.166 --> 10:09.417
-(grunts)
-(groans)

10:09.500 --> 10:12.792
Ha, oh! Did you see that?

10:12.875 --> 10:14.291
(groans)

10:17.125 --> 10:19.125
We just took a major hit. Ryan!

10:19.208 --> 10:21.125
Oh, man, that hurt.

10:21.208 --> 10:22.917
Anytime now, Harris.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.125
-(beeps)
-Got it.

10:27.667 --> 10:29.125
It's coming right at us!

10:32.333 --> 10:33.709
(Harris) Punch, now!

10:36.625 --> 10:38.375
(groans)

10:38.458 --> 10:41.000
(buzzing noise)

10:41.875 --> 10:43.291
How do you like getting stung?

10:43.375 --> 10:44.333
Yes!

10:44.417 --> 10:45.333
Hooo! Yeah!

10:45.417 --> 10:47.542
-(groans)
-Oh, no, we took a hit!

10:47.625 --> 10:49.458
(grunts) Of course we did.

10:49.542 --> 10:52.750
That robot always defeats my monsters,

10:52.834 --> 10:56.333
so this time... I planned accordingly.

10:58.667 --> 11:01.792
Oh, look! Is that the press?

11:01.875 --> 11:03.333
Come on!

11:04.333 --> 11:06.917
Godfrey Chambers,
reporting live from Bay City High.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.542
Cassie Park, streaming on GramOGram
and Everyvide.

11:10.834 --> 11:12.709
You're part of a dying industry.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.625
(Harris) It's invisible,
but it looks like it's wounded.

11:16.709 --> 11:18.333
It's just hovering in one place.

11:18.417 --> 11:19.709
That means we can finish it off.

11:19.792 --> 11:20.667
Spyder?

11:20.750 --> 11:22.875
Ten boss-level missiles comin' right up.

11:27.917 --> 11:31.083
I don't know what Mech X-4 is doing,
but I've told you many times, Bay City.

11:31.166 --> 11:33.166
The Mech X-4 is dangerous.

11:33.250 --> 11:35.458
And now... he seems to be proving it.

11:35.542 --> 11:36.959
Something is clearly not right.

11:37.041 --> 11:43.000
Oh, no... I-- I'm an injured, sitting duck
just... waiting to be blasted.

11:44.333 --> 11:45.709
Missiles away!

11:48.041 --> 11:49.458
Perfect.

11:51.709 --> 11:53.333
(Harris) Guys...

11:53.375 --> 11:55.166
the wasp is starting to move!

12:00.542 --> 12:01.375
Oh, no...

12:07.750 --> 12:09.500
Ohh! Ho-ho!

12:09.583 --> 12:10.750
That was good!

12:27.250 --> 12:29.333
The monster tricked us
into hitting the school.

12:29.417 --> 12:32.125
Accident!
Guys, that was an accident, I swear.

12:32.208 --> 12:33.917
It's gone!

12:35.375 --> 12:37.667
Our school is gone!

12:37.750 --> 12:42.000
And that... is how you turn a hero robot

12:42.083 --> 12:45.041
into public enemy number one.

12:51.250 --> 12:54.500
This is Cassie Park,
streaming live from Bay City.

12:54.583 --> 12:57.208
Our school's been d-- destroyed...

12:57.291 --> 12:59.709
No, Cassie, that was an invisible monster.

12:59.792 --> 13:01.000
She can't hear you, nimwit.

13:01.083 --> 13:04.125
We were set up. He made it look like
we're the villains.

13:04.208 --> 13:06.041
(sighs)

13:17.959 --> 13:21.875
(Godfrey) And in an act of cowardice,
Mech X-4 fled the scene.

13:21.959 --> 13:25.333
I always said that thing was evil.
So the lesson is...

13:25.417 --> 13:26.834
I'm always right.

13:29.959 --> 13:34.166
We are live here at a press conference
at Harper Futuristics...

13:34.250 --> 13:36.458
I was one of Mech X-4's

13:36.542 --> 13:38.583
biggest supporters...

13:38.667 --> 13:40.166
and I was wrong.

13:40.250 --> 13:42.250
-And for that, I'm sorry.
-(scoffs)

13:42.333 --> 13:45.208
Now, I don't know what the substance
under the school is,

13:45.291 --> 13:46.792
but I have met with the mayor,

13:46.875 --> 13:49.000
and I promise you, I will remove it,

13:49.083 --> 13:52.792
and I will rebuild Bay City High.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.333
-(applause)
-Go Llamas!

13:54.417 --> 13:57.041
Okay, so he makes us
look like the villains?

13:57.125 --> 13:59.291
And then the city just...
hands him the ooze?

14:00.000 --> 14:01.041
He played us.

14:02.041 --> 14:03.917
-Things couldn't get any--
-Don't.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.291
What?

14:05.375 --> 14:07.834
You're about to say
"things can't get any worse."

14:07.917 --> 14:10.417
And every time someone says that...
it gets worse.

14:10.500 --> 14:12.041
(phone ringing)

14:14.542 --> 14:15.667
(scoffs)

14:16.750 --> 14:18.083
It's Mom.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.041
(Grace) Honey, are you with Ryan?

14:24.125 --> 14:25.458
Y-- Yes.

14:25.542 --> 14:26.875
Uh, hi, Mom.

14:26.959 --> 14:29.542
I've been trying to reach you
for hours. Are you okay?

14:29.625 --> 14:32.458
Uhh... yeah, we're fine.

14:32.542 --> 14:34.041
How's Northwest Fest?

14:34.125 --> 14:36.458
You think I'd stay there
with a crazy robot on the loose?

14:36.542 --> 14:39.458
No. Thankfully, Seth sent
a helicopter to bring me back.

14:39.542 --> 14:42.291
Mom? Where are you?

14:42.959 --> 14:44.375
(sighs) Harper Futuristics.

14:44.458 --> 14:46.583
Seth said
it's the safest place in the city.

14:46.667 --> 14:48.125
Where are you now? He'll send a car.

14:48.208 --> 14:49.750
Mom, no! Harper is--

14:49.834 --> 14:51.750
Happy to help!

14:52.959 --> 14:54.542
Where are you guys?

14:54.625 --> 14:56.834
You know what?
I'll grab a pen and write it down. Okay?

14:56.917 --> 15:02.250
Um... did you really think
that you could just walk around

15:02.333 --> 15:05.000
inside my head
without me learning your secrets?

15:05.083 --> 15:06.375
What?

15:06.458 --> 15:07.875
You know?

15:07.959 --> 15:09.291
Everything.

15:09.375 --> 15:14.125
You... your friends... the robot.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.000
You want your mommy?

15:22.458 --> 15:24.000
Come get her.

15:24.583 --> 15:26.041
(Leo) You wanna do what?

15:26.125 --> 15:27.458
You wanna do what?

15:27.542 --> 15:29.208
Attack Harper Futuristics.

15:29.291 --> 15:31.917
I wanna go to his office,
punch a hole in his building,

15:32.000 --> 15:33.834
-and get my mom back!
-(chuckles lightly)

15:33.917 --> 15:35.458
(Leo) No, no, no, no...

15:35.542 --> 15:37.166
Are you scared
it's gonna ruin your rep?

15:37.250 --> 15:38.709
The whole city already hates us.

15:38.792 --> 15:41.750
It's still cray. Squared!

15:41.834 --> 15:43.542
You got a better idea?

15:43.625 --> 15:47.041
Yeah, well, most of mine are terrible,
and that's exactly what I'd suggest.

15:47.125 --> 15:49.959
No. Just-- Listen to your friend, okay?
Don't-- Don't go--

15:50.041 --> 15:52.375
Harper's gonna be ready for you,
you can't waltz in there,

15:52.458 --> 15:55.291
like you own the place, willy-nilly,
and expect everything to be fine--

15:56.417 --> 15:57.709
What's the worst Harper can do?

15:57.792 --> 15:59.333
Throw a monster at us?

16:00.333 --> 16:02.083
We can take it!

16:02.166 --> 16:05.125
I'm saying we take one step back
and think this through.

16:06.208 --> 16:10.458
Guys... from what Leo told me,

16:10.542 --> 16:13.792
I think Harper...
drove my birth parents into hiding.

16:13.875 --> 16:14.959
Wait, what?

16:16.625 --> 16:19.709
My birth parents were afraid
that somebody was after them.

16:19.792 --> 16:20.917
Harper.

16:22.625 --> 16:26.333
Which means he's been messing
with my life since I was born.

16:26.417 --> 16:29.166
He's pretended to care about us.

16:29.250 --> 16:31.375
He's turned the city against us.

16:31.458 --> 16:32.500
And now, he has Mom!

16:32.583 --> 16:36.000
I'm just trying to say...
enough is enough.

16:39.083 --> 16:40.125
I'm doing this.

16:40.208 --> 16:42.542
We... are doing this.

16:43.583 --> 16:45.125
Not alone, you don't.

16:50.542 --> 16:51.625
We'll have to be careful.

16:51.709 --> 16:54.333
Our shields are down 50 percent.

16:54.417 --> 16:56.709
Well, we'll just have to make sure
that we don't get hit.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.458
Thank you, guys.

17:00.542 --> 17:04.417
Mm. Yeah, quick question... does,
uh, your mom like bad boys?

17:04.500 --> 17:05.583
-Ey.
-(Harris) Inappropriate.

17:05.667 --> 17:09.041
-Come on, dude...
-Terrible timing. Terrible timing.

17:16.375 --> 17:18.917
(Harris) My scans of Harper Futuristics
show your mom and Harper

17:19.000 --> 17:20.583
are alone in his penthouse office.

17:20.667 --> 17:23.625
Perfect. We're gonna smash
through his window and grab Mom.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.333
-Gently grab Mom.
-You realize she's gonna figure out

17:26.417 --> 17:27.417
you guys are in the robot.

17:27.500 --> 17:29.542
She can ground us after she's safe.

17:29.625 --> 17:31.542
She's not gonna tell my mom, is she?

17:31.625 --> 17:34.083
This whole time I've told her
I've been on the wrestling team.

17:34.166 --> 17:35.417
She already knows you're lying.

17:35.500 --> 17:38.208
(Harper) Guys! Hey! You made it!

17:38.291 --> 17:41.542
Give me my mom back, or else
I'm gonna punch a hole in your penthouse.

17:41.625 --> 17:45.500
Which... would be terrifying if my new
friends weren't here to protect me.

17:45.583 --> 17:48.125
Bay Command. Circling around for a pass.

17:55.417 --> 17:58.417
(Pilot) Fox Four to Bay Command.
We've hit the target.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.333
Circling around for another pass.

18:00.417 --> 18:02.709
Fighter jets? We're fighting the military?

18:02.792 --> 18:04.792
Yeah. They didn't even need
to be convinced

18:04.875 --> 18:08.834
you were an enemy of the state after you,
you know... destroyed the school.

18:08.917 --> 18:09.792
Bad move, guys.

18:09.875 --> 18:13.875
But hey... don't worry.
I... will keep your mom safe.

18:15.834 --> 18:17.667
They're gonna be back
in firing range soon.

18:17.750 --> 18:19.458
-Targeting!
-Wait, don't fire!

18:19.542 --> 18:22.000
We can't hurt them.
They're just doin' their jobs!

18:25.667 --> 18:28.834
Critical hit!
We've got multiple system failures here!

18:31.500 --> 18:33.000
Nice shot!

18:37.333 --> 18:41.041
(Major) Mech X-4!
Surrender or be destroyed!

18:42.625 --> 18:43.875
We need to leave now!

18:43.959 --> 18:46.291
We can't attack them,
they're not gonna stop attacking us!

18:46.375 --> 18:47.625
Mom's still in there!

18:49.083 --> 18:51.625
Guys, those fighter jets
are circling back around.

18:51.709 --> 18:55.083
Ryan? Mark? Your mom. Your call.

18:56.417 --> 18:57.375
(missile hits)

19:03.417 --> 19:05.125
Leo was right.
We shouldn't have come here.

19:05.208 --> 19:08.166
-We have to leave.
-What? No way!

19:09.208 --> 19:11.667
If we get killed, who saves Mom?

19:11.750 --> 19:15.500
If the robot gets destroyed...
who stops Harper?

19:22.792 --> 19:23.625
You're right.

19:24.709 --> 19:25.834
I hate it, but you're right.

19:37.417 --> 19:38.709
Let's get some rest.

19:40.709 --> 19:42.667
We'll come back for Mom.

19:42.750 --> 19:45.583
And we're gonna make Harper sorry
he ever messed with my family.

20:06.917 --> 20:10.917
Mm-hm. Listen, Grace, I'm sure
that Mark and Ryan are fine.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.458
Okay? I will find them, honey.

20:13.542 --> 20:14.417
I promise.

20:15.291 --> 20:16.417
Okay.

20:17.625 --> 20:20.792
Any idea why the robot wanted this stuff?

20:20.875 --> 20:21.917
No clue.

20:22.750 --> 20:25.667
Sir... the robot
was just spotted near Mount Hartley.

20:25.750 --> 20:28.000
Hartley, huh? Scramble the jets.

20:29.125 --> 20:31.834
-Let's move out!
-(man) All right, let's move!

20:33.709 --> 20:35.875
-Sir.
-Morris.

20:37.166 --> 20:38.917
There's more gel than we expected.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.583
The uh... device is gonna need
some calibration.

20:42.333 --> 20:43.834
That's... fine.

20:43.917 --> 20:46.500
The military will end the robot.

20:46.583 --> 20:50.834
I have my gel and...
Grace has my shoulder to cry on

20:50.917 --> 20:53.417
when she hears the bad news
about her kids.

21:07.875 --> 21:10.125
Here's to the birth of a new world.

21:14.792 --> 21:16.792
And to the end of this one.

21:19.542 --> 21:20.959
(theme music playing)

21:43.792 --> 21:45.208
(barks)
