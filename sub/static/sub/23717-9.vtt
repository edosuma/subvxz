00:15.724 --> 00:20.729
Seok, did you know
your twin cousins are coming today?

00:22.564 --> 00:24.357
Cousins?

00:25.650 --> 00:28.611
The twins? Oh!

00:29.154 --> 00:32.490
- Hey, who told you to do that?
- Right.

00:32.615 --> 00:33.992
- Do as I tell you to do.
- My twin cousins.

00:34.117 --> 00:36.286
- Teleport!
- Except for a mole on one of their necks,

00:36.411 --> 00:38.288
- they looked exactly alike.
- Fast. I can see the after-image.

00:38.413 --> 00:40.540
But they had
totally different characters.

00:40.665 --> 00:44.127
One was an outgoing troublemaker.

00:44.252 --> 00:45.170
He used to tease other kids.

00:45.295 --> 00:48.131
The other one was one of the kids
he made cry.

00:48.256 --> 00:51.134
- Do it like this.
- Anyway, I loved both of them.

00:51.259 --> 00:52.969
- I liked playing with them.
- Good.

00:53.094 --> 00:55.305
Jun, what do you think?
That's my artwork.

00:55.430 --> 00:58.141
- Teleport.
- Hey, stop it.

00:58.266 --> 01:00.643
They may retaliate someday.

01:00.769 --> 01:03.271
No way. They can't do that.

01:03.813 --> 01:06.399
Those little dudes were so cute.

01:06.524 --> 01:08.693
- How have you been?
- Hello.

01:08.818 --> 01:10.612
Their voices are still the same.

01:10.737 --> 01:11.571
- Seok.
- Seok.

01:14.282 --> 01:19.245
- It's been a long time.
- I've never forgotten about you.

01:19.996 --> 01:22.540
You've grown.

01:22.665 --> 01:24.834
Let's have fun like the good old days.

01:34.302 --> 01:35.929
Find him!

01:37.180 --> 01:38.223
Where is he?

01:38.348 --> 01:39.224
Jong-uk Cho

01:39.641 --> 01:42.310
THE HOT-TEMPERED BIG BROTHER
JONG-UK CHO

01:43.436 --> 01:46.731
Seok, Seok!

01:47.232 --> 01:49.776
THE TIMID LITTLE BROTHER
JONG-GUK CHO

01:53.154 --> 01:56.950
See what happens once I catch you!

01:57.075 --> 02:00.954
- What a fun game!
- Seok, Seok!

02:05.041 --> 02:08.128
Seok, Jong-guk is--

02:10.004 --> 02:12.423
Seok, I don't want to see.

02:12.549 --> 02:14.676
I'll kill you!

02:14.801 --> 02:16.636
Seok!

02:19.722 --> 02:21.558
Jong-uk!

02:23.935 --> 02:24.936
Jong-guk!

02:25.854 --> 02:26.938
Come here, Seok!

02:28.898 --> 02:30.608
Jong-uk, wait a minute.

02:33.736 --> 02:36.447
- Jong-uk!
- Got you!

02:39.534 --> 02:42.287
It's been such a long time.
I had so much fun!

02:43.329 --> 02:45.248
Why do I feel like
we did this last Sunday, too?

02:45.373 --> 02:48.001
Why do you guys do this all day long?

02:48.126 --> 02:50.420
We have nothing to do.
You're the only one we know in Seoul.

02:50.545 --> 02:52.922
We have no friends or girls here.

02:53.923 --> 02:54.883
Is that right?

02:55.925 --> 02:57.510
Girls?

02:58.344 --> 03:00.388
Okay, tomorrow, then.

03:01.598 --> 03:05.059
Listen, I arranged you
a blind date tomorrow.

03:05.184 --> 03:07.937
Each of you will meet a girl.

03:08.563 --> 03:11.232
You're so cool, man!

03:12.191 --> 03:13.776
Wow!

03:14.402 --> 03:17.322
- Thanks, Seok.
- Wow!

03:17.906 --> 03:20.158
You'll meet Seoul girls.

03:20.283 --> 03:21.951
Seoul girls?

03:22.076 --> 03:24.120
I've never met any!

03:28.124 --> 03:29.125
THE FOLLOWING DAY

03:29.250 --> 03:30.418
ONE HOUR BEFORE THE DATE

03:31.294 --> 03:35.131
What? It's too late to cancel!

03:35.798 --> 03:37.258
Just one girl? That's even worse!

03:37.383 --> 03:39.469
I have two guys here.
What do I do now?

03:40.470 --> 03:42.513
If this goes wrong, they will kill me.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.724
I'll be chased or beaten to death.

03:44.849 --> 03:46.392
Aw, shit!

03:50.021 --> 03:51.689
Oh, no!

03:53.483 --> 03:57.403
Wait, there is a girl.

03:57.528 --> 03:58.947
And they are twins...

04:02.325 --> 04:03.576
TWINS

04:03.701 --> 04:06.079
Just in case, I will stay near you,

04:06.204 --> 04:07.664
and call you to give advice.

04:07.789 --> 04:08.873
Don't worry. You'll be okay.

04:08.998 --> 04:13.169
Wow, you came to support me.
You're awesome, man!

04:13.294 --> 04:16.005
- Thank you, Seok.
- It's okay.

04:16.130 --> 04:19.050
What? Why call me?

04:19.175 --> 04:20.635
I don't need that.

04:20.760 --> 04:23.096
Hey, listen to me.

04:23.221 --> 04:25.348
You've never met Seoul girls before.

04:25.473 --> 04:29.811
- They are completely different.
- Really?

04:31.312 --> 04:32.981
Okay, I'll listen to you.

04:42.365 --> 04:43.866
Hi.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.577
- Oh...
- Are you Yerim?

04:46.703 --> 04:49.831
- Yes, nice to see you.
- Glad to see you.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.710
Have a seat, please.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.671
You're so beautiful.

04:56.796 --> 04:58.464
Thank you.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.259
I've heard a lot about you.

05:02.176 --> 05:03.511
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

05:07.307 --> 05:11.352
Say you're going to the restroom.
and come out through the back door.

05:11.811 --> 05:15.356
I'm sorry, but I have go to the restroom.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.734
The food is here.

05:17.859 --> 05:20.528
I'll be back soon. Enjoy your food.

05:20.653 --> 05:21.738
Okay.

05:28.661 --> 05:30.413
He's going number two.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.254
- Yerim?
- Yeah?

05:38.379 --> 05:42.091
You started eating without waiting for me.

05:44.761 --> 05:46.429
You were taking too long.

05:46.554 --> 05:48.848
Yeah, things were so congested.

05:48.973 --> 05:50.975
It was so hard to--

05:52.643 --> 05:54.812
You don't need to tell me every detail.

05:54.937 --> 05:56.939
It's still so congested.

05:57.065 --> 05:58.816
It will be like that all day long.

05:58.941 --> 06:01.944
I'll show you later.

06:05.531 --> 06:07.241
Good. Everything is going well.

06:07.366 --> 06:09.911
Okay, you can go back.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.126
Oh, this--

06:23.633 --> 06:25.468
Come out and call me.

06:27.720 --> 06:28.971
Right now?

06:30.807 --> 06:31.641
Just a moment.

06:37.188 --> 06:41.150
I'm sorry.
It took me longer than I thought.

06:41.275 --> 06:44.028
- You were so quick.
- Excuse me?

06:50.368 --> 06:54.288
This stake is delicious.
I love meat so much.

06:54.413 --> 06:57.250
So, you ate mine, too?

06:57.375 --> 06:58.709
Is this what Seoul girls are like?

06:58.835 --> 07:01.045
Would you like some house wine?

07:05.424 --> 07:08.469
- No, thanks.
- Oh.

07:12.640 --> 07:15.435
- You don't drink?
- No, I don't.

07:16.644 --> 07:17.520
I see.

07:18.688 --> 07:24.735
- So, things are going well?
- Yes, definitely!

07:25.403 --> 07:28.281
Why are you asking?

07:28.406 --> 07:30.283
I'm going in.

07:37.373 --> 07:43.379
There's a man who loved you so much.

07:43.504 --> 07:47.633
Everyone makes fun of me
I have a mosquito voice.

07:47.758 --> 07:50.052
Oh, you really sound like a mosquito.

07:53.848 --> 07:55.391
Come meet me.

07:55.516 --> 07:57.101
Sorry, wait a second.

07:57.226 --> 07:59.437
- I have something important to do.
- Okay.

08:05.026 --> 08:07.862
He's great.

08:07.987 --> 08:10.448
Yeah, he's gentle and sweet.

08:10.573 --> 08:13.326
Besides, he doesn't drink. I like that.

08:13.451 --> 08:15.077
Okay. Talk to you later.

08:15.203 --> 08:18.789
Oh, he's driving me nuts!

08:23.085 --> 08:27.089
Wow! Here, here!

08:27.215 --> 08:29.008
Is this how they treat a customer?

08:29.133 --> 08:30.301
What a frigging place!

08:30.426 --> 08:32.470
- Hey, here!
- What's wrong with this guy?

08:32.595 --> 08:34.555
He's totally unpredictable.

08:34.680 --> 08:36.557
- Just a moment, sir.
- Aw!

08:38.476 --> 08:39.393
They're driving me nuts.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.647
I'm doing okay.
You can go home now.

08:42.772 --> 08:45.816
I'm fine. I'll stay here until--

08:45.942 --> 08:46.817
No, I'm really doing okay.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.861
She is already into me.

08:50.696 --> 08:53.658
Wait, wait.

08:54.325 --> 08:55.409
Wait.

08:58.579 --> 08:59.956
Again? Why?

09:00.498 --> 09:02.041
He's driving me nuts!

09:03.668 --> 09:05.503
HE IS A PSYCHO.

09:05.628 --> 09:08.548
Sorry, I'm back again.

09:08.673 --> 09:10.716
He is so unpredictable.

09:14.512 --> 09:16.430
Did she finish all this?

09:16.556 --> 09:18.057
Are all Seoul girls like her?

09:18.182 --> 09:22.144
- You certainly do love meat.
- Yeah.

09:22.270 --> 09:25.064
- Shall we go now?
- Yes.

09:26.899 --> 09:28.901
Give me your bag.
That looks heavy.

09:29.026 --> 09:30.403
No, I'm--

09:36.617 --> 09:38.202
- Let's go.
- Okay.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.918
Understood?
I have no problem. Stop calling me.

09:46.043 --> 09:48.796
I'll kill you if you call me again.

09:49.505 --> 09:51.716
Okay.

09:52.717 --> 09:55.886
I'm not letting it slide anymore
just because you're my cousin.

09:59.181 --> 10:01.100
No! That really hurts!

10:03.644 --> 10:06.188
- Wait here for a second.
- Okay.

10:10.151 --> 10:12.695
Oh, were you out here?

10:14.697 --> 10:16.240
Yes, you asked me--

10:19.368 --> 10:20.620
Where's my bag?

10:21.245 --> 10:23.331
What? Your bag?

10:23.998 --> 10:27.251
I don't like to carry things around.

10:27.376 --> 10:30.630
- So I left it at home.
- What? Where's your home?

10:30.755 --> 10:31.714
In Taebaek.

10:31.839 --> 10:35.551
- How did you get here?
- I took the bus.

10:35.676 --> 10:38.262
I don't have a license or a car.

10:39.388 --> 10:40.890
Did I leave anything in there?

10:48.981 --> 10:49.857
Yerim?

10:51.734 --> 10:54.195
Where did you get this?

10:54.320 --> 10:57.740
- It was parked in the alley.
- He's a thief.

10:58.032 --> 11:01.202
My bag, this car.
Everything makes sense now.

11:01.327 --> 11:05.623
- Are you going to drive this car?
- Yes.

11:06.624 --> 11:09.001
Driving under the influence
without a license?

11:11.962 --> 11:16.133
I need to go to the restroom.
I'll be back soon.

11:17.885 --> 11:21.055
This is it. It's time to run!

11:24.183 --> 11:26.102
- Wow...
- Ugh!

11:26.227 --> 11:28.020
The man is supposed to drive, but--

11:28.145 --> 11:30.022
sorry, you'll have to drive.

11:30.147 --> 11:31.273
Let's go now.

11:34.443 --> 11:35.319
Let's go.

11:36.445 --> 11:38.072
Wow, all right!

11:39.532 --> 11:42.034
My car! Where my car?

11:42.159 --> 11:44.370
She's a thief!

11:44.495 --> 11:45.913
Thief!

11:48.999 --> 11:50.167
Oh, great.

11:51.752 --> 11:53.087
Why did he ask me to drive?

11:53.879 --> 11:55.923
What if the police think
I'm an accomplice?

11:57.299 --> 11:59.802
Where are we going?

12:00.845 --> 12:03.055
I want to go to the police, but--

12:03.180 --> 12:05.099
Where do you want to go?

12:05.224 --> 12:08.727
Well, some place quiet
where we can get some fresh air.

12:08.853 --> 12:09.687
What do you think?

12:09.812 --> 12:12.773
To a deep forest!

12:12.898 --> 12:14.358
Oh, no! He's planning to bury me!

12:15.901 --> 12:18.654
Here comes a police car!

12:18.988 --> 12:20.114
Are they following us?

12:21.073 --> 12:22.491
- Oh.
- Shit.

12:22.616 --> 12:24.743
- Shall I pull over?
- Yes, why not?

12:24.869 --> 12:27.163
- Let's find out why they're following us.
- Okay.

12:27.288 --> 12:28.747
They will save me.

12:30.916 --> 12:34.920
Aw, what the--

12:35.045 --> 12:37.673
aw, shit!

12:40.468 --> 12:43.471
- Come with me.
- Yes, Officer!

12:43.637 --> 12:44.638
Huh?

12:46.974 --> 12:48.434
- Here she is!
- Are you sure?

12:48.559 --> 12:49.560
She stole my car!

12:49.685 --> 12:52.188
I knew it after you ate all my steak.

12:52.313 --> 12:53.981
- What?
- Get out.

12:54.106 --> 12:56.734
What are you doing here?

12:56.859 --> 12:58.944
Why are you here?

12:59.069 --> 13:03.199
Oh, are you twins?

13:03.324 --> 13:05.117
Get the hell out of my face,
you ugly mug!

13:05.743 --> 13:07.703
You are uglier than me!

13:08.787 --> 13:09.872
I look much better than you!

13:09.997 --> 13:11.457
- Ugh...
- Gee!

13:11.582 --> 13:13.792
- Urgh...
- Aww...

13:13.918 --> 13:15.419
- Aw.
- I'm going nuts.

13:21.425 --> 13:24.678
Okay, that went well.

13:30.726 --> 13:35.397
BROTHERHOOD

13:41.028 --> 13:42.238
I'm going out.

13:42.363 --> 13:45.616
- Your lunch is on the table.
- Okay.

13:59.171 --> 14:00.673
YOU MORON
LOVE YA, YOUR BROTHER

14:53.100 --> 14:54.143
Seok!

15:00.608 --> 15:02.860
Oh, that was close!

15:09.033 --> 15:10.492
Ae-bong!

15:13.078 --> 15:18.208
I will... kill you.

15:18.334 --> 15:20.502
Ae-bong, are you mad?

15:20.628 --> 15:22.338
Are you going to beat me?

15:22.463 --> 15:24.798
You're going to beat me, aren't you?

15:24.924 --> 15:25.925
AE-BONG IN A CAST

15:26.050 --> 15:27.301
Ae-bong!

15:45.027 --> 15:47.821
You must be uncomfortable.
I'm sorry.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.199
It's okay.
I know you didn't do that on purpose.

15:50.324 --> 15:52.576
You can't eat or do anything on your own.

15:52.701 --> 15:54.828
Don't move. I'll do everything for you.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.497
No, you can go home.

15:56.622 --> 15:58.165
Here.

16:00.876 --> 16:02.127
Good!

16:11.804 --> 16:13.806
Oh, no. I had too much ice cream.

16:13.931 --> 16:15.975
- Ouch! Oh, no!
- Here.

16:16.433 --> 16:17.559
I want to wash my hands.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.937
Do you want to wash your hands?

16:24.066 --> 16:24.942
No, I want to wash my feet.

16:25.609 --> 16:28.404
Wait, wait.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.447
- Don't.
- You can't wash your feet on your own.

16:30.572 --> 16:31.490
I can do it.

16:31.615 --> 16:33.367
How can you wash your feet
without using your hands?

16:33.492 --> 16:35.452
Close the door now!

16:48.173 --> 16:49.008
She can do it.

16:50.801 --> 16:53.137
She can even use chopsticks
with her feet.

16:57.016 --> 17:00.102
Seok, don't you have to go home?

17:00.227 --> 17:01.311
Don't you have a deadline to meet?

17:03.105 --> 17:04.940
I've never missed a deadline until now.

17:05.441 --> 17:07.860
To meet a deadline? Is that enough?

17:07.985 --> 17:09.236
You must do your best

17:09.361 --> 17:10.779
to make the viewers laugh!

17:10.904 --> 17:12.281
Do you call yourself a webtoon artist?

17:12.406 --> 17:14.074
Have some respect for the viewers!

17:15.659 --> 17:17.327
Ae-bong.

17:21.957 --> 17:26.253
Thank you for understanding me.

17:26.378 --> 17:28.964
Oh, this idiot!

17:29.465 --> 17:30.299
Oh, I can't hold it anymore.

17:30.424 --> 17:31.425
I've gotta go!

17:36.805 --> 17:37.723
Ae-bong, what's wrong?

17:39.099 --> 17:40.309
Ae-bong!

17:53.614 --> 17:56.200
Ae-bong, can you wipe your butt?

17:57.034 --> 17:58.952
Ae-bong, can you really do it?

17:59.620 --> 18:00.871
No, that's impossible.

18:00.996 --> 18:03.040
Ae-bong, no need to feel embarrassed!

18:03.165 --> 18:04.291
Did you wipe your butt?

18:04.416 --> 18:06.627
He's doing this on purpose.

18:09.546 --> 18:14.551
Sometimes, it's okay,
even if you can't wipe your butt.

18:15.511 --> 18:16.678
I can use the bidet!

18:16.804 --> 18:18.472
Just go! I want some rest!

18:19.556 --> 18:22.601
- Aren't you hungry?
- Do you think I'm a pig?

18:22.726 --> 18:25.562
I just had lots of food.
I'm not hungry. Go now!

18:25.687 --> 18:27.189
Okay, I'll go.

18:37.407 --> 18:39.243
Finally, I'm alone.

18:40.327 --> 18:42.496
He's so stupid.

18:46.917 --> 18:49.128
All of a sudden, I am hungry.

19:24.288 --> 19:25.581
Yummy!

19:26.415 --> 19:29.168
Ae-bong, I'm too worried to go.

19:37.217 --> 19:38.468
You were hungry.

19:40.345 --> 19:43.891
How can you be so stupid?

19:44.224 --> 19:45.142
Didn't I tell you to go?

19:45.267 --> 19:46.852
Tell me, do you think I'm kidding?

19:46.977 --> 19:48.562
What do I look like?

19:48.687 --> 19:52.316
A little funny,
because of all that sauce.

20:02.534 --> 20:05.746
I didn't know, sorry.

20:07.539 --> 20:08.665
Want to go out?

20:10.083 --> 20:13.378
No, I can't go out like this.
I can't even put on makeup.

20:13.503 --> 20:16.381
You don't need makeup.
You're so pretty.

20:20.802 --> 20:23.013
No, I'm not going out without makeup.

20:23.680 --> 20:24.890
I can help you.

20:25.724 --> 20:28.143
Don't overdo it.
I want a natural look.

20:39.613 --> 20:42.366
Is this really your first time trying it?
You're good.

20:42.491 --> 20:44.284
I'm an artist, you know.

20:53.210 --> 20:54.461
I'm a webtoon artist.

20:54.586 --> 20:56.171
Done!

20:57.589 --> 21:00.717
I'm a comic webtoon artist.

21:04.304 --> 21:05.514
Let me see the mirror.

21:06.014 --> 21:09.059
There's no need. You're so pretty.

21:09.518 --> 21:11.228
It's cold outside. Put this on.

21:15.607 --> 21:16.984
I can't see!

21:18.235 --> 21:19.486
Let's go.

21:20.696 --> 21:24.032
Did you know
there's a crazy woman around here?

21:24.157 --> 21:27.077
Really? No way.

21:33.875 --> 21:36.712
Did you hear that?
There is a crazy woman around here.

21:36.837 --> 21:39.923
Sorry, that crazy woman is you.

21:40.048 --> 21:42.301
Yes, let's be careful.

21:52.769 --> 21:55.355
Why is everyone looking at me today?

21:55.480 --> 21:57.482
Do I look weird
because my arms are hidden in this?

21:57.941 --> 21:59.109
No.

21:59.609 --> 22:00.902
I'm thirsty.

22:01.028 --> 22:03.780
- I'll go get something to drink.
- Okay.

22:03.905 --> 22:05.449
- Hurry back.
- Yeah.

22:10.746 --> 22:12.706
Hey, kid, are you okay?

22:12.831 --> 22:14.708
Can you stand up?

22:16.001 --> 22:17.085
Are you okay?

22:17.210 --> 22:20.505
Sorry, I can't use my arms.

22:20.630 --> 22:23.842
Stand up. Can you stand up?

22:28.722 --> 22:30.223
What is she doing?

22:30.348 --> 22:32.809
Hey, you crazy bitch!

22:33.185 --> 22:35.562
Stop it right now! Get up!

22:36.855 --> 22:38.315
What a psycho!

22:38.440 --> 22:40.901
How dare you kick my son?

22:45.655 --> 22:47.908
Baby, are you happy to be outside?

22:48.033 --> 22:49.951
Mommy is happy, too.

22:52.162 --> 22:53.580
Are you okay? Aren't you hurt?

22:59.586 --> 23:03.048
- It's the crazy woman.
- She's the crazy woman.

23:04.132 --> 23:06.176
- Wow.
- What are they doing?

23:06.301 --> 23:07.511
- The crazy women!
- They are ready to fight!

23:07.636 --> 23:09.763
- Oh, my gosh!
- They're ready to go.

23:09.888 --> 23:11.431
Who's gonna win?

23:12.432 --> 23:16.061
- That's what I mean.
- Wow, there are two of them.

23:16.186 --> 23:18.396
- Are there crazy women gathering here?
- What's happening in this neighborhood?

23:19.064 --> 23:20.065
Oh, I'm scared!

23:21.608 --> 23:25.320
- Are you okay? You go first.
- Okay.

23:25.987 --> 23:28.323
- Thanks.
- I'm sorry.

23:28.448 --> 23:30.992
- So scary!
- They must be friends.

23:31.118 --> 23:32.160
- Ugh.
- Something is going on here.

23:33.620 --> 23:34.996
They're probably having a big fight.

23:35.122 --> 23:37.999
- Ae-bong.
- I saw the crazy woman.

23:38.125 --> 23:40.252
- There, look.
- Yeah, I saw her, too.

23:40.377 --> 23:42.879
Oh, my gosh! She's so scary.

23:43.004 --> 23:45.257
- Let's go home. I'm scared.
- Yeah.

23:47.134 --> 23:48.301
Me, too.

23:48.802 --> 23:51.888
Asshole, what's this?

23:52.013 --> 23:53.598
Do you really wanna die?

23:53.723 --> 23:55.851
What have you done to me, you moron?

23:55.976 --> 23:57.310
Sorry.

23:57.435 --> 23:59.896
- Shut up. Just remove the makeup.
- Yeah.

24:02.274 --> 24:03.567
But how do I remove it?

24:03.692 --> 24:05.068
Do you really wanna die?

24:05.193 --> 24:06.862
There is cleansing water.

24:06.987 --> 24:09.072
Soak two cotton pads with it
and put them on my eyes.

24:12.033 --> 24:15.579
- Cleansing water?
- The one with a white cap! Hurry!

24:19.416 --> 24:20.250
NAIL POLISH REMOVER

24:20.375 --> 24:22.210
- Hurry up!
- Okay.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.008
What is that?

24:28.133 --> 24:31.094
Do you really wanna die? It hurts!

24:32.137 --> 24:35.682
Ugh, that idiot. I really wanna kill him.

24:36.725 --> 24:41.354
Ae-bong, how are your arms?

24:41.563 --> 24:44.232
What happened to your eyes?

24:44.357 --> 24:45.775
And look at your clothes!

24:45.901 --> 24:47.861
Oh, my God, look at you!

24:47.986 --> 24:49.696
Look at you!

24:49.821 --> 24:51.489
Oh, no.

24:53.533 --> 24:56.536
Mom, could you read me the text message?

25:00.832 --> 25:07.130
"I'm so sorry. How are your eyes?
Are you okay?"

25:07.255 --> 25:10.550
All right, you didn't do it on purpose.
I'll forgive you.

25:10.675 --> 25:11.509
- Mom.
- Yeah.

25:11.635 --> 25:13.261
Can you send a text for me?

25:13.386 --> 25:15.555
I'm not good at those kind of things.

25:15.680 --> 25:18.225
Take your time. Here we go.

25:18.350 --> 25:23.146
I'm fine. Are you working
or playing a game?

25:29.110 --> 25:31.363
I'M FINE. ARE YOU WORKING
OR PLAYING A GAY?

25:31.488 --> 25:33.990
What? Is she still mad at me?

25:37.202 --> 25:39.746
- You've got another one.
- Could you read it for me?

25:41.206 --> 25:44.709
A chicken head is wondering
about something.

25:45.126 --> 25:47.796
Is this idiot really crazy?
Wait a second.

25:47.921 --> 25:49.506
Mom, send a text like this.

25:49.631 --> 25:53.134
CAN YOU COME TO ME NOW?

25:53.260 --> 25:54.636
Does this mean she's not mad anymore?

25:55.595 --> 25:56.429
Okay.

25:56.554 --> 25:59.474
- Oh, he sent another message.
- Read it for me.

25:59.599 --> 26:00.684
"NOW?"

26:00.809 --> 26:06.147
A pig is covering its eyes with its hands
and putting on a show, now.

26:08.024 --> 26:09.818
Could you touch the talk button?

26:14.406 --> 26:16.491
- Mom, cover your ears.
- What?

26:22.789 --> 26:24.624
Hi, Ae-bong, I was just drawing you--

26:24.749 --> 26:27.502
You beanpole!

26:27.627 --> 26:30.922
How could you send me
those frigging texts, you ugly asshole!

26:31.047 --> 26:31.923
I will break your spine in half,

26:32.048 --> 26:34.384
and make it three feet long.

26:34.509 --> 26:37.053
Then you'll be three feet tall.
How's that, you--

26:37.178 --> 26:40.140
I'll punch your face
until all your teeth fall out like corn!

26:40.265 --> 26:43.893
Do you want that? Answer me!

26:44.019 --> 26:44.978
You hung up on me?

26:45.103 --> 26:46.604
You're out of your mind!

26:46.730 --> 26:48.648
- Mom, push it again.
- Again?

27:10.253 --> 27:15.258
THE CREATION OF AE-BONG

27:24.309 --> 27:27.562
Oh, I'm so tired of all this.

27:33.526 --> 27:36.863
Hey, be careful.

27:37.781 --> 27:40.825
She's that crazy bitch in this area.

27:42.911 --> 27:44.788
Ugh, a bee!

27:58.468 --> 28:01.096
Right, the crazy bitch.

28:02.430 --> 28:05.141
Baby, don't look.
