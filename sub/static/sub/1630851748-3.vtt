[snorting]

00:16.625 --> 00:17.916
[neighing]

00:18.000 --> 00:20.708
Ooh la la, love is in the air.

00:20.791 --> 00:23.708
You know, seeing this reminds me
that horses and humans

00:23.791 --> 00:26.458
are some of the few mammals
that do not have a penis bone.

00:26.541 --> 00:27.500
So romantic.

00:27.583 --> 00:30.416
[BTG] Ah. But love isn't
all about penetrative sex,

00:30.500 --> 00:31.750
like these flamingos.

00:31.833 --> 00:34.750
-[sobbing]
-Dietrich, buddy, come on!

00:34.833 --> 00:37.041
You're ruining
the most romantic scene on Earth.

00:37.125 --> 00:39.000
It's just… It's just…

00:39.083 --> 00:41.166
pink was Margie's favorite color.

00:41.250 --> 00:42.583
She would have loved this.

00:43.291 --> 00:46.041
Why did you leave me? Why?

00:46.125 --> 00:48.875
Margie was trash.
She belongs in a dumpster.

00:48.958 --> 00:50.875
You don't wanna live in a dumpster,
do you?

00:50.958 --> 00:53.000
I'll live anywhere
if Margie's there. [sniffling]

00:53.083 --> 00:55.625
I'd live in a prison toilet
if it meant one more second

00:55.708 --> 00:57.916
with my sweet, beautiful angel.

00:58.500 --> 01:01.833
-Man, this is worse than I thought.
-Who's Margie again?

01:01.916 --> 01:03.833
You don't remember? Melon Baby?

01:03.916 --> 01:05.583
Dietrich's "not really girlfriend

01:05.666 --> 01:07.625
because she doesn't like labels"
girlfriend.

01:07.708 --> 01:09.666
I'll never meet someone like her again.

01:09.750 --> 01:12.916
[sobbing] I'm disgusting! I'm unlovable!

01:13.000 --> 01:14.083
[sobbing]

01:14.166 --> 01:16.000
Love is hard.

01:17.208 --> 01:19.125
Dietrich, look at these flamingos.

01:19.208 --> 01:21.166
They have to perform
an elaborate line dance

01:21.250 --> 01:24.375
with specific moves
all in the hopes of impressing a mate.

01:24.458 --> 01:27.875
The best dancers find someone.
The others, well…

01:27.958 --> 01:29.583
It's like going to the club.

01:29.666 --> 01:32.541
Sometimes you go home alone,
sometimes you get lucky in the bathroom.

01:32.625 --> 01:33.500
Ugh.

01:33.583 --> 01:36.000
[squawking]

01:36.083 --> 01:37.791
[Dietrich] What's wrong with that bird?

01:37.875 --> 01:40.291
-Why didn't she take him?
-Not every bird gets a mate.

01:40.375 --> 01:42.125
It's just natural selection at work.

01:42.208 --> 01:43.625
That bird is perfectly fine.

01:43.708 --> 01:45.791
He deserves a mate just like anyone else.

01:45.875 --> 01:47.208
No, not really.

01:47.291 --> 01:50.375
He's undersized, his beak is malformed.
He isn't even dancing.

01:50.458 --> 01:52.708
And look, now he's humping that plant.

01:52.791 --> 01:53.791
He's a good bird!

01:53.875 --> 01:56.333
-He just needs some encouragement.
-Don't interfere!

01:56.416 --> 01:57.791
Come on, bird!

01:58.500 --> 02:01.500
You can do this! Go after her. Shoo! Shoo!

02:04.083 --> 02:05.500
[grunts] Go!

02:06.333 --> 02:08.333
[honking]

02:09.083 --> 02:12.625
You're doing it all wrong.
You gotta dance like the other birds.

02:12.708 --> 02:13.708
Like… Like this.

02:13.791 --> 02:16.208
[vocalizing]

02:18.000 --> 02:19.875
-[honks]
-[Dietrich] That's it.

02:19.958 --> 02:21.166
You got it now.

02:21.250 --> 02:22.166
Hey!

02:22.666 --> 02:25.333
What? No! Stop humping that plant! Dance!

02:25.416 --> 02:26.916
[vocalizing]

02:28.291 --> 02:29.333
Yeah!

02:29.958 --> 02:32.041
Wait! Not me. Him!

02:32.125 --> 02:33.833
[laughing] Bravo, Dietrich!

02:33.916 --> 02:36.416
I've never seen another zoologist
insert themselves

02:36.500 --> 02:38.333
into a group mating ritual before.

02:38.416 --> 02:40.500
Come on, Bonnie! Take Dietrich's lead!

02:40.583 --> 02:41.750
[Bonnie] Already on it!

02:41.833 --> 02:43.458
[grunts melodically]

02:43.541 --> 02:45.500
No, Bonnie, dance like the flamingos.

02:45.583 --> 02:48.208
-This is like the flamingos.
-Is it, though?

02:48.875 --> 02:52.458
Dietrich, you're a genius!
This is field zoology at its finest.

02:52.541 --> 02:54.541
-[laughs]
-[honking]

02:54.625 --> 02:57.458
What are you doing? Me?

02:57.541 --> 03:00.583
No, I can't betray my friend.

03:00.666 --> 03:02.625
I-- This is so wrong.

03:02.708 --> 03:05.000
Ah. Yet so right.

03:05.083 --> 03:08.958
Wait! What am I doing?
I can't be in a relationship with a bird.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.791
This is crazy! Right?

03:11.875 --> 03:14.458
No! Dietrich, you can't date a bird.

03:14.541 --> 03:15.708
Yeah, I know that.

03:16.291 --> 03:18.291

<i>a crested black macaque,</i>

03:28.416 --> 03:32.416
<i>we had returned to Sulawesi</i>
<i>in hopes of reuniting her with her troop,</i>

03:32.500 --> 03:34.500
<i>where she might also find a mate.</i>

03:34.583 --> 03:35.666
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

03:35.750 --> 03:37.250
[sniffing] Mm-hmm.

03:37.333 --> 03:39.583
Okay. [sniffs]
I think we're on the right track.

03:39.666 --> 03:42.708
Ooh, hear that, Rosie?
Love is just around the corner.

03:42.791 --> 03:45.500
You're gonna be knee-deep
in some macaque by sundown.

03:45.583 --> 03:48.916
Stop getting Rosie's hopes up, Bonnie.
Love's a twisted lie.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.208
[thunder crashing]

03:50.291 --> 03:51.666
We should just go home.

03:51.750 --> 03:54.250
It's gonna rain, just like in my heart.

03:54.333 --> 03:56.958
We're not going anywhere.
Look at that macaque's buttocks.

03:57.041 --> 04:00.833
The female Sulawesi macaque's buttocks
grown larger during the breeding season

04:00.916 --> 04:01.916
to attract mates.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.916
The bigger the buttocks,
the more attractive she becomes.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.750
If we don't take advantage
of those buttocks right now,

04:07.833 --> 04:09.708
she might miss out on finding a mate.

04:09.791 --> 04:10.750
Yeah, Dietrich.

04:10.833 --> 04:14.000
-Look how big and engorged that butt is.
-No.

04:14.083 --> 04:16.416
You'll never see buttocks
this engorged again.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.041
It's a once-in-a-lifetime butt!

04:18.125 --> 04:20.625
[laughing] So big!
Do not let this butt pass you by!

04:20.708 --> 04:22.708
-Look at it! Look at it!
-Okay, fine!

04:25.791 --> 04:27.125
Whoa!

04:27.208 --> 04:28.375
Big, right?

04:28.458 --> 04:30.458
Yeah, big.

04:30.541 --> 04:32.083
Rosie's got that big old booty,

04:32.166 --> 04:34.416
and she's on the lookout
for some meaty macaque.

04:34.500 --> 04:35.500
Good for Rosie.

04:35.583 --> 04:39.333
Dietrich, come on, mate.
Love is hard to find, but you'll find it.

04:39.416 --> 04:42.208
Ah. I remember my first love.

04:46.500 --> 04:49.166
This vervet monkey exhibit
is pretty cool, huh?

[zoo guide] <i>Male vervet monkeys</i>

[Bonnie] <i>Uh, hold up. No, stop.</i>

05:07.625 --> 05:10.666

the end of that story.

05:21.666 --> 05:23.416
Please help me!

05:23.500 --> 05:25.375

05:25.458 --> 05:26.541

[sobbing]

05:27.708 --> 05:29.625
-Dietrich?
-That's not me.

05:29.708 --> 05:32.750
[yelping] I surrender!

05:32.833 --> 05:35.625
That woman is trapped
in an eagle ray mating display.

05:35.708 --> 05:36.708
It's okay, we got you!

05:36.791 --> 05:39.625
Don't worry! We pull Dietrich
out of these things all the time!

05:39.708 --> 05:41.375
Save me, giant macaque!

05:41.458 --> 05:43.875
Oh.

05:46.250 --> 05:47.500
[inhales]

05:47.583 --> 05:49.833
Oh. Oh my God. [gasps]

05:49.916 --> 05:51.833
Bonnie, I'll attract the eagle rays to me.

05:51.916 --> 05:54.375
-Dietrich, get her out of there!
-She's incredible.

05:54.458 --> 05:56.375
[BTG] Dietrich, snap out of it,
you dopey mango.

05:56.458 --> 05:58.041
Right! Save her. I can do that.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.583
[gags] Excuse me.

05:59.666 --> 06:01.500
Those eagle rays won't be fooled for long.

06:01.583 --> 06:03.666
To advertise their size
and strength to mates,

06:03.750 --> 06:05.750
eagle rays leap six to eight feet
in the air

06:05.833 --> 06:07.625
and do a massive gut-wrenching belly flop.

06:07.708 --> 06:10.583
The bigger the belly flop,
the more likely he'll attract a mate.

06:11.833 --> 06:12.708
Ouch.

06:16.333 --> 06:17.666
[gasps]

06:18.208 --> 06:19.375

Uh, Dee Ter.

06:26.583 --> 06:27.708

06:30.833 --> 06:32.416
Wait. No, I'm not.

06:32.500 --> 06:34.708
My name is Hilda. Why did I say that?

06:34.791 --> 06:38.083
Hilda is my name,
counting eagle rays was my game.

06:38.166 --> 06:40.833
-Wait, you're a zoologist?
-I'm a field assistant.

06:40.916 --> 06:42.333
I'd prefer to teach, though.

06:42.416 --> 06:44.666
Being inside is much safer
than being outside.

06:44.750 --> 06:46.083
That's what I always say!

06:46.166 --> 06:47.791
-[BTG grunts, screams]
-Oh.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.333
You need some help, Uncle B?

06:49.416 --> 06:51.416
[screaming]

06:54.208 --> 06:58.000
Oh, wow. I've never met another zoologist
who's also afraid of the zoo.

06:58.083 --> 07:01.083
I mean, the outdoor zoo.
Well, I mean, nature.

07:01.166 --> 07:04.958
Well, don't worry, I've been stuck
in a lobster cage before, so…

07:05.041 --> 07:06.875
[chuckles] …sort of an expert.

07:07.416 --> 07:09.625
Lobster Cage Houdini is what they call me.

07:09.708 --> 07:12.916
Actually, no one calls me that.
Please don't call me that. Whoa!

07:13.666 --> 07:14.750
[grunts, laughs]

07:14.833 --> 07:17.875
All right, all right,
you oversexed slime pancakes.

07:17.958 --> 07:20.541
They really went wild
for your belly flop, Uncle B.

07:20.625 --> 07:23.791
Gravity is the big man's best friend.
[sighs] Where's Dietrich?

07:25.625 --> 07:26.666
We're fine!

07:27.291 --> 07:29.166
[sighs] I got this.

07:29.250 --> 07:31.250
[upbeat music playing]

07:34.750 --> 07:36.666
[both] Whoa!

07:37.208 --> 07:38.416
[gasps]

07:39.500 --> 07:40.500
[yelps]

07:41.083 --> 07:42.458
Oh God! What's happening?

07:42.541 --> 07:44.291
It doesn't usually do this.

07:44.375 --> 07:46.250
[yelping]

07:46.333 --> 07:47.541
Ah.

07:50.041 --> 07:51.416
[yelping]

07:51.500 --> 07:52.750
Oh. Oh.

07:53.875 --> 07:55.291
Thank you guys so much.

07:55.375 --> 07:57.958
I was afraid an eagle ray
would scrabble into my cage

07:58.041 --> 08:00.500
and drown me
with his terrifying sea wings.

08:00.583 --> 08:01.916
Whew. You got lucky.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.666
We were tracking Sulawesi macaques
to reintroduce this girl into the wild.

08:05.750 --> 08:07.916
Wow! She's really engorged.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.666
You could say that again, sister.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.125
You should come with us.

08:11.208 --> 08:14.833
We need big help,
and you must come and commit to full-time.

08:14.916 --> 08:19.333
Oh, pardon my companion here.
He's a little-- What is he?

08:19.416 --> 08:21.541
-Boner Brain?
-I'm totes fine.

08:21.625 --> 08:23.166
I'm cool, baby.

08:23.250 --> 08:24.500
Like a pepperoni log.

08:24.583 --> 08:26.000
-[buzzing]
-[coughs]

08:26.083 --> 08:29.375
It certainly couldn't hurt
to have a local guide, if you don't mind.

08:29.458 --> 08:32.041
Not at all.
In fact, I'd rather not be alone.

08:32.125 --> 08:34.208
Sometimes I think this jungle is haunted.

08:34.291 --> 08:35.625
Byah! Ha-ha!

08:35.708 --> 08:38.333
Haunted jungle me say! Me say also!

08:38.416 --> 08:42.416
Okay. Uh, you guys go ahead.
We'll be right behind you.

08:42.500 --> 08:44.583
Buddy, what the hell are you doing?

08:45.250 --> 08:46.541
No! [whimpers]

08:46.625 --> 08:47.875
-[Dietrich] She's wonderful.
-No!

08:47.958 --> 08:49.625
Bonnie, this is it.

08:49.708 --> 08:52.458
I've never met anyone
who just instantly understands me.

08:52.541 --> 08:54.833
Yeah, uh, I can see that,

08:54.916 --> 08:57.250
but you've gotta calm down.

08:57.333 --> 08:59.375
-Act aloof, you know?
-Aloof?

08:59.458 --> 09:02.125
Yeah!
That's how I got my first girlfriend.

09:03.125 --> 09:05.375
[sighs]<i> Her name was Minori.</i>

09:05.458 --> 09:08.583
-Hey, Bonnie, mind if I sit here?
-Oh, hey, Minori.

09:08.666 --> 09:09.791
Sure, I don't care.

09:09.875 --> 09:12.416
-I don't care, either.
-Seriously, I don't care.

09:12.500 --> 09:13.875
I could care less!

09:13.958 --> 09:15.208
[moaning]

09:15.291 --> 09:16.375
[school bell rings]

09:16.458 --> 09:20.125
So, she can consume
his nutritious reproductive fluids.

09:20.208 --> 09:23.541
Dietrich, did you know Hilda works
at the Sulawesi Rehabilitation Center?

09:23.625 --> 09:25.166
Yes, of course I knew that!

09:25.250 --> 09:28.041
Uh, nice fanny pack. What's in yours?

09:28.125 --> 09:32.583
I put all my F things in mine, like floss.
It's extra strength.

09:32.666 --> 09:35.750
Oh, really? I put all my P things in mine.

09:35.833 --> 09:37.750
For "pack." Like peanuts.

09:37.833 --> 09:40.500
Hmm, I put all my B things in my beard.

09:41.041 --> 09:43.958
[grunting] Like this bow and arrow.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.041
Huh?

09:46.125 --> 09:47.458
Want one?

09:49.416 --> 09:50.666
[munching]

09:52.000 --> 09:53.291
Oh, look!

09:53.375 --> 09:55.916
Over there,
there's a Sulawesi toothless rat.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.250
Oh yeah!

09:57.333 --> 10:00.291
That's a newly discovered species, right?

10:00.375 --> 10:03.625
I read they slurp down worms
like spaghetti.

10:03.708 --> 10:05.708
[thunder rumbling]

10:06.708 --> 10:08.500
Oh, that's not good.

10:08.583 --> 10:11.333
I don't think these rain clouds
are gonna pass any time soon.

10:11.416 --> 10:14.166
Oh no! And this is a mudslide area.

10:14.250 --> 10:16.875
Mudslides are in my top 17 fears.

10:16.958 --> 10:18.000
[inhales]

10:20.875 --> 10:23.125
-[macaque screeching]
-What's that, girl? What do you hear?

10:23.208 --> 10:24.375
I'll check it out.

10:26.291 --> 10:28.041
[thunder crashing]

10:29.083 --> 10:30.583
I can't see anything!

10:31.375 --> 10:33.708
[grunting]

10:33.791 --> 10:35.708
Babirusa!

10:35.791 --> 10:37.458
We need to climb now!

10:37.541 --> 10:39.791
But I'm not a good climber.
I have weak hands!

10:39.875 --> 10:41.083
Oh my God, so do I!

10:41.166 --> 10:44.291
But that's not good. You probably
want someone with strong hands.

10:44.375 --> 10:46.583
-I guess I probably should want that.
-[babirusa grunting]

10:46.666 --> 10:48.583
[grunting]

10:48.666 --> 10:50.333
-Murder pigs!
-[screaming]

10:51.291 --> 10:52.458
[screams]

10:52.541 --> 10:53.625
[Dietrich whimpers]

10:54.250 --> 10:56.375
Oh my God! That was so inappropriate.

10:56.458 --> 10:59.083
-I didn't mean anything by that.
-Oh, you didn't?

10:59.166 --> 11:00.708
[babirusas growling]

11:03.208 --> 11:05.125
-We should play dead.
-Good idea.

11:05.208 --> 11:06.333
[both grunt]

11:06.416 --> 11:08.041
Stay calm, you two!

11:08.125 --> 11:10.916
Those male babirusas
are fighting for dominance.

11:12.083 --> 11:15.708
The male babirusas must fight other males
in order to find a mate.

11:15.791 --> 11:18.375
-[grunting]
-The winner becomes the alpha of a harem.

11:18.458 --> 11:22.041
The loser lives out his life
in solitary loneliness.

11:22.125 --> 11:24.041
[grunts, growls]

11:24.125 --> 11:27.208
[screams] I think he wants
to put his stink on us!

11:27.291 --> 11:29.291
[thunder rumbling]

11:31.958 --> 11:35.416
-So, I guess we're in a harem now.
-Second time we got trapped today.

11:35.500 --> 11:37.291
Ha! So true.

11:37.375 --> 11:38.625
Oh God!

11:38.708 --> 11:41.333
Hey! Lay off, jerk pig! Ahh!

11:41.833 --> 11:42.791
[grunting]

11:42.875 --> 11:45.500
Oy, pig. They're with me.

11:45.583 --> 11:47.125
[thunder rumbling]

11:47.208 --> 11:48.375
[growling]

11:48.875 --> 11:50.625
[howling]

11:50.708 --> 11:51.666
[grunting]

11:53.583 --> 11:54.708
[yells]

11:54.791 --> 11:55.916
[grunts]

11:56.000 --> 11:58.416
Whoa, easy now. I love your work.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.375
-[growling]
-[groaning]

12:00.458 --> 12:02.916
Oh, hey, buddy, I'm sorry.

12:03.000 --> 12:06.375
Come on, don't worry.
They grow back. Believe in yourself!

12:07.875 --> 12:08.833
[groans]

12:09.625 --> 12:11.500
[grunting]

12:13.416 --> 12:17.041
Whoa! No, no, no, no, no!
You have the wrong idea, ladies.

12:17.125 --> 12:19.666
I'm happily married. Also, these tusks…

12:20.791 --> 12:22.250
Not real. Totally fake.

12:22.875 --> 12:24.166
[grunting]

12:27.625 --> 12:30.666
Deeter, thank you for sticking up for me.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.250
That was really brave.

12:32.333 --> 12:35.041
Ah, it was nothing. [laughs]

12:35.125 --> 12:36.416
Don't mention it.

12:36.500 --> 12:40.208
Guys, for real, we've got to head back.
This rain is getting intense.

12:40.291 --> 12:43.458
You're right. All right, everyone,
we need to move to higher ground.

12:43.541 --> 12:47.458
Hilda, how does your boyfriend feel
about you being in the field all the time?

12:47.541 --> 12:49.041
Oh, I never had a boyfriend.

12:49.125 --> 12:52.583
Oh God, you must think I'm so lame.
Never mind.

12:52.666 --> 12:55.125
What about you? Do you have a girlfriend?

12:55.208 --> 12:57.708
Well, I had a melon baby with my last one,

12:57.791 --> 13:00.208
but it was eaten by a lizard
from the inside,

13:00.291 --> 13:01.458
so that ended.

13:01.541 --> 13:03.041
[rumbling]

13:03.791 --> 13:05.958
Whoa, mudslide!

13:10.416 --> 13:12.041
[animals calling]

13:12.125 --> 13:14.791
[BTG] <i>The mudslide carried us deep</i>
<i>into a jungle ravine.</i>

13:14.875 --> 13:18.333
<i>We survived, but we're no closer</i>
<i>to finding our macaque a mate.</i>

13:18.416 --> 13:20.416
[squawking]

13:21.416 --> 13:22.916
Man, that came on fast.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.208
-Everyone still with us?
-I'm fine.

13:25.291 --> 13:26.875
Uh, where's Dietrich?

13:29.541 --> 13:32.750
[screams]

13:32.833 --> 13:34.708
Oh, I'm alive.

13:35.458 --> 13:36.666
Okay, that's good.

13:36.750 --> 13:39.250
The rain seems to have stopped
for the time being,

13:39.333 --> 13:43.333
but with all this mud,
tracking's gonna be impossible.

13:43.416 --> 13:44.791
Poor Rosie!

13:44.875 --> 13:48.791
All she wants is for her engorged booty
to be seen and appreciated.

13:48.875 --> 13:50.041
[gasps] Wait a second.

13:52.750 --> 13:56.000
No, no, no! No, no, no, no, no!

13:56.083 --> 13:58.833
-What's that? What's wrong?
-Uncle B, we've got an emergency.

13:58.916 --> 14:01.166
-Rosie's butt is shrinking.
-Are you serious?

14:01.250 --> 14:04.083
If her butt shrinks too much,
she may not be able to attract a mate,

14:04.166 --> 14:06.041
and our entire expedition
will be for nothing!

14:06.125 --> 14:09.000
Um, excuse me, I feel something.

14:09.083 --> 14:11.916
We get it, Dietrich, you're in love.
Now is not the time.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.958
We've got to get these gorgeous buttocks
in play right now.

14:15.041 --> 14:19.000
-We don't have a second to lose.
-No. Guys, I feel something down there.

14:19.083 --> 14:22.833
Ugh! Dietrich, no, dude.
Come on, man. Hilda's right there.

14:22.916 --> 14:27.000
No, there's an angry snake in there!
There's a great big snake in my pants!

14:27.083 --> 14:29.333
For the love of God, Dietrich. Shut up!

14:29.416 --> 14:30.416
Are you sure?

14:30.958 --> 14:32.250
[groans]

14:32.333 --> 14:33.416
What are you doing?

14:33.500 --> 14:35.625
-Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah.
-[groaning]

14:35.708 --> 14:37.208
Oh, dear. [inhales]

14:37.291 --> 14:39.875
-Where the hell is it going? [grunts]
-[screaming]

14:39.958 --> 14:41.583
-[hissing]
-[laughs]

14:41.666 --> 14:44.500
Look at that! It's just a mangrove snake.

14:44.583 --> 14:47.250
Don't worry,
their bite might make you swell up a bit,

14:47.333 --> 14:49.083
but it's nothing serious. Ha.

14:49.166 --> 14:52.000
-Off you go, little guy.
-Oh. Wow.

14:52.083 --> 14:53.458
Wait a second.

14:54.625 --> 14:55.958
-[grunts, gasps]
-[hissing]

14:56.041 --> 14:58.291
Uh-oh. That's a Krait.

14:58.375 --> 15:00.833
A full dose of their venom
will kill you in 30 minutes.

15:00.916 --> 15:02.375
You can't even feel them bite.

15:02.458 --> 15:05.416
Just stay out of the mud. [grunts]
I'll find a way out of here.

15:05.500 --> 15:07.833
I don't feel a bite anywhere.
I must be dying.

15:07.916 --> 15:10.166
Oh, come on, lover boy.

15:16.541 --> 15:18.250
Ahh! Tarsier!

15:18.333 --> 15:20.291
Oh, look, it's a pair.

15:20.375 --> 15:22.750
Tarsiers live
in monogamous pairings for life.

15:22.833 --> 15:25.708
They live together, mate together,
even sing duets together.

15:25.791 --> 15:28.041
And if their partner dies,
they never repair.

15:28.125 --> 15:30.875
-Aren't you a lovely couple?
-[both squeal]

15:34.875 --> 15:36.708
-Oh no.
-[squeaking]

15:38.666 --> 15:40.791
-[hissing]
-Okay, okay, I'm going!

15:40.875 --> 15:43.208
Why are happy couples so bloody annoying?

15:43.291 --> 15:44.916
Ahh! Mangrove snakes!

15:45.000 --> 15:46.291
Tarsiers!

15:46.375 --> 15:47.916
[grunts] Mangrove snakes!

15:48.000 --> 15:49.541
[groans] Tarsiers!

15:49.625 --> 15:52.291
Fine! Bring on the mangrove snakes.

15:52.791 --> 15:55.666
Ah! Ow! Ooh! Ah! Ow!

15:55.750 --> 15:58.541
Mangrove snakes are really focusing
are on the butt today.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.916
Ow! Ooh! Ow! Ow!

16:01.000 --> 16:03.083
[grunts] Come on!

16:03.166 --> 16:06.458
Ugh, Deeter, you were so brave
around those snakes.

16:06.541 --> 16:08.250
Gee golly.

16:08.791 --> 16:10.250
Gee golly?

16:10.958 --> 16:12.250
Hey… [sniffing]

16:12.333 --> 16:13.250
[licking]

16:13.875 --> 16:14.958
Macaque poo.

16:15.041 --> 16:16.875
They're here, but where?

16:16.958 --> 16:20.250
There's no time.
Rosie's butt is almost normal-sized now.

16:20.333 --> 16:21.250
No offense, Rosie.

16:21.333 --> 16:23.291
We've got to do something. Now!

16:23.375 --> 16:25.250
[grunts] Oh!

16:25.333 --> 16:28.083
[laughs] Thought I had
another macaque suit under there.

16:28.166 --> 16:30.000
My bad. Give me the macaque.

16:31.958 --> 16:34.083
Dietrich, give me that dental floss.

16:34.791 --> 16:37.500
-You thinking what I'm thinking?
-No, probably not.

16:37.583 --> 16:39.583
[adventurous music playing]

16:42.208 --> 16:44.875
I'm not giving up on love!

16:47.041 --> 16:48.875
Whoo-hoo!

16:48.958 --> 16:50.958
[music continues]

16:58.166 --> 16:59.166
[screeching]

17:01.583 --> 17:03.708
Oh God! [gags]

17:05.958 --> 17:08.541
Hmph! I did not have a plan
for getting us down.

17:08.625 --> 17:09.958
[screaming]

17:10.916 --> 17:12.041
[groans]

17:12.708 --> 17:14.000
[screeching]

17:14.083 --> 17:15.166
Love hurts.

17:17.791 --> 17:19.625
Oh my God! It worked!

17:19.708 --> 17:23.041
Rosie, now's your chance!
Go strut your stuff, girlfriend.

17:23.125 --> 17:25.125
[grunting rhythmically]

17:26.000 --> 17:27.791
[screeching]

17:28.416 --> 17:29.375
So beautiful.

17:33.708 --> 17:35.708
Okay. [groans]

17:35.791 --> 17:40.000
My legs are broken.
And my butt, so swollen!

17:40.083 --> 17:41.791
-[grunting]
-Here, let me help you.

17:41.875 --> 17:44.333
[groaning] No, no, no, no, no!

17:44.416 --> 17:49.041
So, uh, I guess this is the end
of our expedition.

17:49.125 --> 17:50.291
I guess so.

17:50.375 --> 17:51.958
-[Dietrich] Hilda.
-Yes, Deeter?

17:52.041 --> 17:54.666
-[Dietrich] I have to tell you something.
-What is it?

17:55.333 --> 17:56.916
My name is Dietrich.

17:57.000 --> 17:57.958
Oh, okay.

17:58.041 --> 17:59.583
But I also wanna tell you…

17:59.666 --> 18:01.791
[hesitating] I think you're awesome.

18:01.875 --> 18:03.958
Really? Wait, me Hilda?

18:04.041 --> 18:06.416
Not another Hilda?
That's happened to me before.

18:06.500 --> 18:07.833
Yes, you Hilda.

18:07.916 --> 18:08.833
Oh. [snorts]

18:08.916 --> 18:09.916
Oh. [laughs]

18:10.000 --> 18:13.833
I had no idea you even liked me.
You're so cool, and brave, and… [snorts]

18:13.916 --> 18:15.250
…h-h-hot.

18:15.333 --> 18:18.166
Well, I've never met anyone like you.

18:18.250 --> 18:22.083
[grunting] Come on!
This is gonna take forever!

18:22.166 --> 18:23.291
-Dietrich!
-What?

18:23.375 --> 18:24.625
A little help here?

18:27.333 --> 18:30.166
[BTG groaning] Ouch.

18:30.250 --> 18:33.750
You're right, it's not ideal.
I'm gonna need a helicopter.

18:33.833 --> 18:35.916
[Bonnie] <i>Where are we gonna get</i>
<i>a helicopter?</i>

18:38.958 --> 18:41.833
Here's a list of the animals
that are rehabilitated

18:41.916 --> 18:44.000
-and ready to be released.
-Oh, nice.

18:44.083 --> 18:46.375
-Who you got there?
-Flamingo.

18:46.458 --> 18:49.291
-Camel.
-Oh yeah. I saw him. He looks great.

18:49.375 --> 18:51.791
Do you think that JR
is really ready to be released?

18:51.875 --> 18:54.083
-[BTG] You tell me.
-[Bonnie] Here, can I just--

18:54.166 --> 18:56.750
-You're… You're not wheel ready.
-I'll just--

18:56.833 --> 18:59.625
[Bonnie] JR!

19:00.250 --> 19:01.333
Hi!

19:02.041 --> 19:03.250
He looks great.

19:03.333 --> 19:05.750
-Hi, buddy!
-You look fantastic.

19:05.833 --> 19:08.666
You are going to be released
into the wild.

19:08.750 --> 19:09.833
Oh!

19:09.916 --> 19:14.083
I think that we have to make sure
that he knows how to court.

19:14.166 --> 19:17.958
Let me tell you how a camel finds love.

19:18.041 --> 19:23.125
First, you got to have
plenty of saliva on your face.

19:23.208 --> 19:24.208
Plenty of foam…

19:24.291 --> 19:27.416
-[Bonnie] Oh my God!
-…that says, "I see you, ladies."

19:27.500 --> 19:29.500
Then you inflate your soft palate.

19:30.125 --> 19:31.041
[blowing]

19:31.125 --> 19:33.375
-[laughs]
-And now you thrash about.

19:36.791 --> 19:38.375
And he's getting laid tonight.
