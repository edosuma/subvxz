WEBVTT

00:02.544 --> 00:03.753
Previously on Justified...

00:03.961 --> 00:06.798
Raylan? Raylan!
What in God's name did you do?

00:08.717 --> 00:10.968
Thank you, Raylan. You're a good man.

00:11.095 --> 00:12.720
Not good enough.

00:12.805 --> 00:17.850
I got you out of jail.
At the very least, I'll get you back in.

00:17.935 --> 00:20.520
I was on a protection duty this week
for this judge,

00:20.604 --> 00:23.147
and he said he'd get the terms
of your probation adjusted.

00:23.232 --> 00:25.858
- So you can get out of Kentucky.
- How far away you want me?

00:25.943 --> 00:29.028
It's about keeping you safe.
I can't be watching your back anymore.

00:32.700 --> 00:36.953
Sit. Cuff yourself.
You move, I'll shoot you in the kneecap.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.747
Next time I see you, I'm gonna...

00:40.374 --> 00:44.377
Methamphetamine is a modern-day plague,
like locusts, only worse.

00:44.461 --> 00:47.964
If I come back out here again
and you're still cooking up that poison...

00:48.465 --> 00:53.511
Well, be careful what you're doing in there,
I hear these things blow up all the time.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.304
Fire in the hole.

00:57.307 --> 01:00.560
Oh, you bastard. Gil was in the back.
You killed Gil.

01:01.228 --> 01:04.897
Did my daddy send you?
I told him I was starting a church.

01:04.982 --> 01:07.483
Yeah, and he embraces that, Boyd,
with all his might.

01:07.568 --> 01:08.943
But you don't screw with a man's business.

01:09.027 --> 01:12.530
A meth lab blew up in the woods
outside of Harlan.

01:12.865 --> 01:16.451
And the local police there had a CI inside.

01:17.035 --> 01:18.661
He was killed.

01:20.038 --> 01:21.956
So now he's killed someone.

01:35.012 --> 01:36.512
- Come out of the tent with your hands up!
- Come on out!

01:36.638 --> 01:38.014
- Put your hands up!
- Get up! Come on!

01:38.140 --> 01:40.349
- Get out! Get out! Now!
- Get on the ground!

01:42.811 --> 01:44.520
Good morning, gentlemen.

01:44.605 --> 01:48.858
Please remain facedown with your legs
spread until you are told otherwise.

01:48.984 --> 01:51.861
You are now in the custody
of the Kentucky State Police

01:51.945 --> 01:54.113
and the US Marshals Service.

01:54.198 --> 01:58.201
Raylan, with all this manpower,
you looking for Osama bin Laden?

01:58.327 --> 02:00.036
'Cause I'm fair certain he ain't here.

02:00.120 --> 02:03.873
You must be proud. You made it most of
three weeks before murdering someone.

02:03.999 --> 02:05.958
- Sorry.
- Mr. Crowder,

02:06.043 --> 02:08.211
Captain Choate of the
Kentucky State Police

02:08.294 --> 02:12.965
has identified a parolee living among you,
in violation of the terms of his release.

02:13.050 --> 02:16.010
All this fuss is over one parole violator?

02:16.220 --> 02:18.888
Well, unless you've got something else
you'd like to tell me about.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.641
Well, "They strike the shepherd
so the sheep may scatter."

02:21.725 --> 02:22.809
- Amen.
- Amen.

02:22.893 --> 02:25.144
The shepherd? Is that you?

02:26.647 --> 02:27.730
Come up out of there!

02:27.856 --> 02:29.982
- Let me see your hands!
- What the hell you think I'm trying to do?

02:30.067 --> 02:33.736
Hey. Hold up. I think I know that voice.

02:37.574 --> 02:41.035
Hey. Looky here. It's Dewey Crowe.

02:42.913 --> 02:45.498
Luther, you know
you're going back to prison.

02:45.582 --> 02:48.000
You got like, what,
four years left on your bit?

02:48.252 --> 02:50.169
That could easily turn into 10.

02:50.254 --> 02:52.088
You need friends right now, Luther,

02:52.256 --> 02:54.340
somebody to go to the AUSA
and the judge

02:54.424 --> 02:55.758
and tell them you helped us make a case.

02:55.843 --> 02:58.845
If you do that,
we might be able to go to bat for you.

03:06.603 --> 03:21.951
"You strike at the shepherd
that the sheep may scatter."

03:22.077 --> 03:25.913
"They strike at the shepherd
that the sheep may scatter."

03:27.124 --> 03:32.628
You might strike out the shepherd, but
us sheep, we won't never get struck out.

03:33.964 --> 03:35.464
Or scattered.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.593
Or words to that effect.

04:10.792 --> 04:15.755
Well, Raylan, it seems that we are destined
to be locked in an antagonistic relationship.

04:15.839 --> 04:19.591
As long as you keep putting yourself
in trouble's way.

04:19.676 --> 04:22.678
Are you gonna
introduce me to your friends?

04:25.098 --> 04:28.100
My mistake. I'm sorry. Yes, of course.

04:28.185 --> 04:32.104
Art Mullen, Chief Deputy of this office.
Art's my boss.

04:32.189 --> 04:34.106
I thought you guys had met
that night I shot you,

04:34.191 --> 04:36.692
but, of course, you were unconscious
by the time he showed up.

04:36.818 --> 04:39.862
And this is Detective Frank Choate,
Kentucky State Police.

04:39.947 --> 04:44.325
We are looking into the homicide
of the man blown up in Ransom Holler.

04:44.493 --> 04:48.037
Mr. Crowder, we found this in your camp.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.456
We were wondering
where all this money came from.

04:50.540 --> 04:54.293
Well, there are people in Harlan County
who understand the mission of my church

04:54.378 --> 04:56.379
and support it with generous donations.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.130
These are donations?

04:58.215 --> 05:00.800
Not money you stole from a meth lab
before you blew it to shit?

05:00.884 --> 05:04.553
All from grateful souls
who want to see me expand my ministry.

05:04.721 --> 05:07.056
Well, it's now the property
of the Marshals Service,

05:07.182 --> 05:09.976
until such time as you can prove
that you came by it honestly,

05:10.060 --> 05:14.063
you know, with donation forms and receipts.
And I'm sure you've got all that stuff.

05:14.189 --> 05:17.650
Well, I've never been good at paperwork,
but I'll get right on that.

05:17.734 --> 05:22.154
Boyd, just honestly,
are you working for your daddy?

05:23.031 --> 05:26.158
Is that what this is,
just scaring people back under his wing?

05:26.243 --> 05:29.161
Has it ever occurred to everyone
sitting at this table

05:29.246 --> 05:32.373
that what happened in Ransom Holler
might have been an accident?

05:32.874 --> 05:34.834
So you didn't mean to burn that boy alive.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.419
Well, I'm merely suggesting that

05:36.545 --> 05:40.423
the explosion of a meth lab
might have been accidental.

05:40.549 --> 05:41.924
And if a man was killed,

05:42.050 --> 05:46.012
well, I think we may safely claim
to see the hand of righteousness in it.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.347
And whose hand would that be? Yours?

05:48.432 --> 05:52.268
Only the Lord can be righteous.
I make no such claims for myself.

05:52.394 --> 05:54.478
Do you know anything
about the man you killed?

05:54.604 --> 05:57.064
He was a screw-up, working in a meth lab.

05:57.149 --> 06:00.401
Maybe he was trying to turn his life around,
do some good.

06:00.485 --> 06:02.486
Sure as hell didn't deserve to die like that.

06:02.612 --> 06:06.115
Dear friend, death comes to all of us,

06:06.783 --> 06:09.035
but if he was truly
a man on a righteous road,

06:09.119 --> 06:11.203
he is now with our Heavenly Father.

06:11.288 --> 06:14.582
Would you do me a favor
and just show me in there

06:14.666 --> 06:17.084
where it justifies
the killing of innocent people?

06:17.169 --> 06:20.921
You really don't know shit about
the Heavenly Father, do you, Crowder?

06:21.006 --> 06:24.759
It's assholes like you that give
Christians like me a bad name.

06:24.843 --> 06:28.304
No, Frank, I got this. You want to talk
about the hand of righteousness?

06:28.388 --> 06:31.140
You're gonna find out what that means.

06:35.687 --> 06:40.900
"The Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence.
Violent men take it by force."

06:43.320 --> 06:44.653
Is Crowder completely full of shit?

06:44.738 --> 06:47.907
He is. I just don't know
if he believes it or not.

06:47.991 --> 06:50.743
What do we do now?
Go on back down there to Harlan?

06:50.827 --> 06:53.704
I think our best bet's tracking down
the two meth cookers who were in the lab.

06:53.830 --> 06:56.207
If Boyd didn't already kill them
and dump their bodies somewhere.

06:56.333 --> 06:59.627
Well, exactly. In which case,
we have no witnesses.

06:59.711 --> 07:01.879
Then I think our best bet
is going to Boyd through his father.

07:02.005 --> 07:03.214
One problem we do have,

07:03.340 --> 07:05.591
we don't know the extent
of Bo's old criminal enterprises.

07:05.675 --> 07:08.677
- I can help you with that.
- All right. Do.

07:18.855 --> 07:19.855
Winona.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.609
- Hey.
- Hi. Raylan.

07:24.528 --> 07:28.572
- You just happen to be here?
- No, I was looking for you, actually.

07:29.366 --> 07:32.743
- What did I do now?
- Nothing. No, it was me. I...

07:36.873 --> 07:38.374
When I was...

07:39.042 --> 07:41.418
When I was at your motel room
the other day,

07:42.879 --> 07:44.505
I think I lost my hair clip.

07:44.589 --> 07:47.258
I've looked in the...
I've checked in the car.

07:47.384 --> 07:49.426
Well, I've checked everywhere.
I can't find it.

07:50.929 --> 07:53.013
- What's it look like?
- A hair clip.

07:53.098 --> 07:55.224
What? You got so many hair clips
in your room

07:55.308 --> 07:57.309
you need me to identify my hair clip?

07:57.394 --> 08:00.104
- Well, if I see it, I'll let you know.
- Okay, thanks.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.275
- No. No, no.
- No. I was...

08:04.401 --> 08:06.152
What were you gonna say?

08:07.487 --> 08:12.324
I was just gonna say thank you, again,
for what you did for Gary.

08:13.076 --> 08:15.995
- Just happy it turned out the way it did.
- Are you?

08:19.499 --> 08:20.624
- I got to go.
- I bet you're glad

08:20.750 --> 08:22.001
to be back at work, though, huh?

08:22.085 --> 08:23.377
- Yeah. I am.
- Yeah.

08:23.461 --> 08:25.004
- Sorry.
- All right.

08:25.088 --> 08:26.589
- Okay.
- Okay.

08:32.261 --> 08:35.722
I'm real sorry I didn't take your offer
that first time around, Bo.

08:35.807 --> 08:40.269
I mean, looking back,
it was a real square deal.

08:41.605 --> 08:43.606
You wasn't thinking straight,
was you, Mickey?

08:43.690 --> 08:48.319
I mean, sometimes them chemical vapors,
they seep in your pores

08:48.445 --> 08:52.156
and mess with your brain.
Get you all mixed up.

08:52.532 --> 08:56.619
I ain't too big a man
to say I made a mistake or nothing.

08:57.454 --> 08:59.205
We all make mistakes, right, Johnny?

08:59.623 --> 09:01.207
Every damn day.

09:05.629 --> 09:08.422
Is it too late for us
to get your protection now?

09:08.506 --> 09:12.051
Never too late.
I'll have my boys look after you.

09:12.552 --> 09:15.763
And don't worry,
we'll let bygones be bygones,

09:15.847 --> 09:18.015
get you up and running again.

09:18.141 --> 09:20.559
The rate's gonna be 10.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.396
Last time you said five.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.984
You're what they call "high risk."

09:29.319 --> 09:32.571
Are you really in a position
to haggle over price?

09:32.656 --> 09:36.742
No, no, no. Of course not. 10's fine.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.577
Thank you, Bo. Thank you.

09:38.828 --> 09:42.122
Live and learn.
Isn't that what they always say?

09:42.207 --> 09:44.083
- Yep.
- Live and learn.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.026
- What?
- You sick?

10:11.361 --> 10:12.403
No.

10:13.363 --> 10:17.116
- It's that bad, huh?
- No, Raylan, living in the hole's a party.

10:17.867 --> 10:18.993
I figure I'll give it a year.

10:19.077 --> 10:23.247
If it don't get no better,
I'll take the bedsheet exit. Why are you here?

10:23.373 --> 10:25.082
Well, I was hoping
you'd give me the lay of the land

10:25.208 --> 10:27.042
as far as Bo Crowder
and Harlan's concerned.

10:28.086 --> 10:32.172
So now you want help getting at Bo when
it's because of you he's back on the street.

10:32.257 --> 10:34.883
Me? No, no, no.
Boyd is out because of me.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.802
Bo is out because of you.

10:38.722 --> 10:40.264
I had a lid on Harlan.

10:40.390 --> 10:43.225
- I bet you did.
- Crime went way down after I came in.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.769
You were on the payroll
of a Miami drug cartel.

10:45.895 --> 10:49.398
Yeah, they paid me
to let drugs roll through Harlan.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.442
They didn't stop there.

10:51.568 --> 10:55.571
You know, Bo was the one providing
protection for the meth labs.

10:55.780 --> 10:59.199
I put Bo down, I cut meth in Harlan by half.

10:59.284 --> 11:01.994
- I can imagine.
- No, I don't think you can, Raylan.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.496
You wouldn't believe
the shit I had to deal with.

11:04.581 --> 11:08.459
Trying to flush out them snakes, the Stoll
brothers, spreading their black-tar heroin.

11:08.585 --> 11:11.003
How about Chris Lytle?
Do you remember little Chris Lytle?

11:11.087 --> 11:12.296
Chris Lytle the...

11:12.422 --> 11:15.257
Little faggot walked in front of the marching
band with the stick, yeah, yeah.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.717
I heard he became a Marine.

11:16.801 --> 11:21.597
Yeah. Then he came back, started growing
pot from Harlan to the Virginia state line.

11:21.681 --> 11:24.141
Trying to stomp him
was like playing Whac-A-Mole.

11:25.018 --> 11:28.771
- What was Bo's involvement in all this?
- Protection and collection.

11:28.855 --> 11:31.065
Hey, anything's running,
he's getting a cut of it.

11:31.149 --> 11:33.525
What about after you put him away?
Johnny take over?

11:33.610 --> 11:37.696
No. Bo assigned his collection duties

11:38.531 --> 11:40.115
to Arlo Givens,

11:41.659 --> 11:43.452
whose son's a big US Marshal.

11:45.622 --> 11:47.915
You know, from what I heard,
he did a piss-poor job, too.

11:47.999 --> 11:50.334
Ran it right into the ground.

11:53.338 --> 11:57.549
I can't imagine old Bo's
too happy about that. Can you?

12:03.723 --> 12:04.848
Sir.

12:06.309 --> 12:07.810
Morning, sir.

12:09.479 --> 12:10.771
Mr. Crowder.

12:11.648 --> 12:16.235
I seem to recall you making your first tent
out of bedsheets and broom handles.

12:16.319 --> 12:19.655
You were about knee-high.
Some things never change, huh?

12:19.739 --> 12:24.827
Afternoon, Daddy. I always prayed that
the Lord would guide you into the light.

12:26.371 --> 12:29.164
Welcome to the Church
of the Last Chance Salvation.

12:30.166 --> 12:34.044
You're looking good. This backwoods
lifestyle seems to be suiting you.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.588
I prefer a soft pair of double D's,

12:36.673 --> 12:39.883
a 60-inch widescreen,
and a good stiff drink, myself.

12:40.677 --> 12:41.718
Johnny.

12:42.929 --> 12:45.305
- Is that Hestler Jones?
- In the flesh.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.558
Well, I ain't seen you in a minute.
When did you get your release?

12:47.642 --> 12:50.352
I forget. It was a day ending in a "Y."

12:50.437 --> 12:53.480
Well, did you have to go around and
tell all your neighbors you're a pervert?

12:53.565 --> 12:55.732
How better for me to see
what the new talent is?

12:56.401 --> 12:59.319
That day I came to pick you up at Big Sandy

12:59.404 --> 13:02.990
and I asked you to work some hours
to help me rebuild my business

13:03.074 --> 13:04.992
and you said you wanted
to walk another path,

13:05.076 --> 13:07.202
well, I reacted poorly.

13:07.287 --> 13:10.414
That's why I came to see you today, son,
to say I'm sorry,

13:10.498 --> 13:14.042
to beg your forgiveness
and your indulgence.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.381
What's this?

13:19.466 --> 13:24.052
The smoke from your blast
sent a signal across all of Harlan County.

13:24.596 --> 13:29.349
I got people lining up with cash
in their hands, begging me for protection.

13:30.101 --> 13:31.727
Well, I can't accept this.

13:32.520 --> 13:35.898
- Why not?
- 'Cause I know where it comes from.

13:36.191 --> 13:37.441
The Bible tells us that

13:37.525 --> 13:41.403
a gift blinds the wise and
perverts the words of the righteous.

13:42.572 --> 13:44.948
Well, then let's just consider it an offering,

13:45.408 --> 13:48.952
my tithes to your Church
of the Last This-That-or-the-Other.

13:49.496 --> 13:53.332
You're not taking me seriously, Daddy,
and I don't find that amusing.

13:54.167 --> 13:58.170
You know, it's funny. I was just about
to say the same goddamn thing to you.

13:59.088 --> 14:02.716
I'll send Johnny to tell you
where this hand of God will strike next.

14:02.800 --> 14:06.053
You're wasting your time,
you think I'm doing anything on your behalf.

14:06.137 --> 14:10.098
Whatever you're doing, it's working.
Just keep doing it, son.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.357
Son of a bitch!

14:19.108 --> 14:20.234
God!

14:26.241 --> 14:27.449
Helen.

14:27.784 --> 14:28.867
Hello, Raylan.

14:28.952 --> 14:31.828
Helen, this is Art Mullen. He's my boss.

14:32.997 --> 14:36.792
- You got a nice garden, Mrs. Givens.
- Your boss is a liar.

14:38.711 --> 14:43.882
This was his mama's garden. I promised her
I'd take care of it when she was gone.

14:43.967 --> 14:45.926
I have done a God-awful job.

14:46.177 --> 14:49.429
- It's a lot of work.
- Hand me that, would you?

14:50.723 --> 14:51.890
Sure.

14:52.642 --> 14:55.185
Hey, let me ask you something.
Do you get snails?

14:55.270 --> 14:59.064
Whole armies of the little bastards.
You got a cure?

14:59.607 --> 15:02.651
Well, I was hoping you did.
I mean, I've tried everything.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.861
I even tried crushing them
and stringing them on a line

15:04.946 --> 15:07.573
as a lesson to the other snails,
but they don't seem to care.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.577
Why are you here, Mr. Mullen?

15:11.661 --> 15:14.496
I thought Raylan didn't want
nothing more to do with us.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.999
No, we just wanted to
have a quick word with your husband.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.376
- He's not here.
- Where is he?

15:19.460 --> 15:20.586
Why?

15:21.629 --> 15:24.047
We just... We needed his advice
about something.

15:24.132 --> 15:28.385
His advice?
You thought that would work? Flattery?

15:29.178 --> 15:33.307
Well... Now, it often does.
You know, 7 out of 10 times, I'd say.

15:34.225 --> 15:37.019
He's down at the VFW, blowing off steam.

15:37.103 --> 15:39.605
Been spending all his time down there lately.

15:40.648 --> 15:44.151
Says those vets
are the only ones who understand him.

15:44.235 --> 15:48.238
- Apparently, his wife does not.
- Well, I wouldn't take it personal.

15:48.323 --> 15:51.033
VFW's the only place
he can get a drink in this dry town.

15:52.410 --> 15:54.453
What do you think he's done this time?

15:54.704 --> 15:56.538
No, no, ma'am. It's nothing like that.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.999
We just wanted to
have a quick word with him, that's all.

15:59.083 --> 16:02.711
You have a nice day.
You've got a beautiful place here.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.714
You know what? Hey.

16:05.798 --> 16:09.468
We know Arlo's been running Bo's
protection business when Bo was in prison.

16:09.552 --> 16:12.179
- Raylan.
- It never ends with you, does it?

16:12.263 --> 16:16.016
- Helen, this ain't personal.
- You can lie to yourself all you want, Raylan.

16:16.559 --> 16:20.020
You can put on that hat and that badge
and pretend you're someone else,

16:20.104 --> 16:23.315
just so you can accept every crazy notion
you hear about your father.

16:23.399 --> 16:24.441
Are you saying I'm wrong?

16:24.525 --> 16:27.319
This look like the palace
of a Harlan County kingpin to you?

16:27.403 --> 16:28.862
I'd say it looks about right,

16:28.946 --> 16:31.823
given the fact that
Arlo ran Bo's business into the ground.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.201
I know nothing about that.

16:34.619 --> 16:38.080
He's gonna have to answer
for pissing Bo's money away.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.707
Do you understand what I'm saying?

16:45.088 --> 16:47.172
Gonna need a new trailer
to cook the meth in.

16:47.256 --> 16:48.465
Bo will get it for you.

16:48.549 --> 16:51.385
Can he get us ephedrine?
It's better than buying that cold shit.

16:51.469 --> 16:54.012
- Bo will get you everything you need.
- Here he is now, boys.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.871
Afternoon, soldier.

17:20.707 --> 17:23.625
Sorry, sir, no membership ID, no entry.

17:24.585 --> 17:27.587
Did you see that part down there
where it says "US Marshal"?

17:27.672 --> 17:30.882
Again, I'm sorry, sir,
but it's veterans and their guests only,

17:30.967 --> 17:32.634
unless you got a warrant.

17:32.719 --> 17:33.844
Are you serious?

17:33.970 --> 17:37.472
Listen, my father's inside,
named Arlo Givens.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.558
Would you just tell him
we need to speak with him?

17:39.642 --> 17:41.184
Just a moment.

17:44.021 --> 17:45.939
That's nice stonework.

17:46.816 --> 17:49.943
Not if you're trying to bounce a ball off it.

17:50.611 --> 17:53.405
I spent my fair share of time out here,
waiting for him.

17:54.949 --> 17:56.867
Sorry, sir. I can't help you.

17:58.035 --> 18:01.329
Well, I know he's in there.
His truck is right there.

18:01.581 --> 18:02.998
Sorry, sir.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.086
- Howdy.
- Good evening.

18:17.638 --> 18:21.892
- We interrupt anything?
- I've been off the clock since 5:00, so...

18:24.937 --> 18:27.856
- You drunk?
- I was heading that direction,

18:27.940 --> 18:29.900
till this detour.

18:29.984 --> 18:32.486
No admission, huh? Did you try flirting?

18:32.570 --> 18:35.197
- He was immune to my charms.
- He said heroes only.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.783
Okay. So, you show him your ass wound?

18:37.867 --> 18:39.618
No, I didn't think
it was that kind of an evening.

18:39.702 --> 18:41.161
Evening, soldier.

18:41.913 --> 18:45.457
I didn't bring my cape.
I'm guessing this will suffice?

18:45.541 --> 18:47.042
- Rangers. Hooah.
- Hooah.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.377
- Where did you serve?
- Afghanistan.

18:49.545 --> 18:54.508
- No shit? We got a boy waiting to ship.
- Great. Maybe he can buy me a drink.

19:02.934 --> 19:05.185
How did you get in?

19:05.269 --> 19:07.354
Deputy Gutterson served in Afghanistan.

19:07.772 --> 19:10.816
- He a mess-hall cook?
- Sniper in the Rangers.

19:10.900 --> 19:13.735
So, he's the shit. And you?

19:14.237 --> 19:16.822
- Art Mullen.
- Chief Deputy.

19:16.906 --> 19:18.365
Have a seat.

19:19.367 --> 19:21.576
- The Afghan War, huh?
- Yes, sir.

19:21.661 --> 19:24.287
"Yes, sir." I like that. "Yes, sir."

19:24.997 --> 19:27.332
So, what can I do for you all?

19:29.168 --> 19:31.419
We're interested in Boyd Crowder.

19:31.504 --> 19:35.507
Isn't he out in the woods
running a revival or something?

19:36.259 --> 19:39.427
Yeah, but we want to know
if he's helping Bo Crowder

19:39.512 --> 19:42.514
and if Bo's re-establishing his businesses.

19:42.598 --> 19:45.642
- Why would I know any of that?
- Because you ran

19:45.726 --> 19:48.186
Bo's protection-and-collection business
while he was in prison.

19:48.271 --> 19:50.272
- I what?
- You deny it?

19:50.356 --> 19:52.482
Hell, yes, I deny it. That's crazy.

19:52.567 --> 19:54.734
Why on Earth
would Bo do something like that?

19:54.819 --> 19:56.862
Okay. We're done here.

19:57.238 --> 20:00.073
- Mr. Givens, what we need you to consider...
- What I'm supposed to say is,

20:00.157 --> 20:03.076
"We know you ran Bo's
protection racket into the dirt."

20:03.160 --> 20:05.537
So it don't take a prophet
to see the future from here.

20:05.621 --> 20:09.416
Okay? You can either sit around,
waiting to catch a bullet

20:09.834 --> 20:11.585
- or...
- What?

20:12.128 --> 20:14.379
Or you can accept protection
from the Marshals Service.

20:18.301 --> 20:19.509
That's why you're here?

20:20.303 --> 20:23.388
- I don't need protection.
- Yeah? What about Helen?

20:23.472 --> 20:27.767
You gonna forgive yourself
if she gets caught in the crossfire?

20:27.852 --> 20:31.187
You are no longer welcome here, any of you.

20:31.272 --> 20:32.314
Okay.

20:32.982 --> 20:37.110
Tell the truth. You didn't honestly think
you could turn me.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.654
I came here as an officer of the law,

20:39.739 --> 20:42.908
because sometimes
we have to make deals with lowlifes

20:42.992 --> 20:45.035
because we have our sights set on life-forms

20:45.119 --> 20:48.413
even somehow lower
on the ladder of lowlifes than they.

20:56.047 --> 20:57.339
Hey, hey.

20:58.174 --> 21:01.259
Now, Arlo, use your words.

21:06.599 --> 21:09.601
Mr. Givens, we're taking down the Crowders.

21:10.895 --> 21:13.855
And you can either go with them or not.

21:30.456 --> 21:31.831
Over here.

21:39.715 --> 21:42.717
Let me guess. Our missing meth cookers.

21:43.678 --> 21:47.013
Each with a bullet hole
in the back of their head.

21:50.267 --> 21:52.227
- Hello, Arlo.
- Bo.

21:52.311 --> 21:55.188
- Thanks for coming. You want a drink?
- Sure.

21:56.315 --> 21:59.609
- What'll you have?
- How about a Singapore Sling?

22:00.611 --> 22:03.029
What the hell do you think I'm gonna have?

22:03.823 --> 22:07.450
I don't know. I'm having some bourbon.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.495
It was a joke, Arlo.

22:11.414 --> 22:13.957
- Helen here?
- No, she's out. Why?

22:14.917 --> 22:19.379
Well, several of the Harlan ladies
brought me care packages

22:19.463 --> 22:21.214
when they heard I was out.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.800
I've kindly been waiting for
Helen to show up at my place

22:23.884 --> 22:26.052
with a big basket of something sweet.

22:26.137 --> 22:29.222
I can't remember the last time
she baked anything.

22:29.306 --> 22:31.433
Well, I can forgive Helen.

22:32.435 --> 22:34.310
Why weren't you there
to welcome me home?

22:34.395 --> 22:37.022
Because I knew how this was gonna go,

22:37.106 --> 22:39.357
and I thought it wasn't gonna
amount to much.

22:42.361 --> 22:43.528
What happened?

22:44.030 --> 22:46.781
Young punks came in,
wouldn't show respect.

22:46.907 --> 22:48.116
You should have made them.

22:48.743 --> 22:50.702
And you shouldn't have
given the job to an old man.

22:50.786 --> 22:52.454
That's why I picked you.

22:53.789 --> 22:58.460
If I'd have left Johnny in charge,
he might have got ideas about taking over.

22:59.962 --> 23:01.629
You know your place.

23:01.756 --> 23:05.800
At least I thought you did.
Where's my money?

23:06.635 --> 23:08.970
There is no money. People stopped paying.

23:09.096 --> 23:12.640
- You invited me over here to tell me this?
- No, Bo, I invited you over to tell you

23:12.725 --> 23:14.559
you have to do something
about your son Boyd.

23:14.643 --> 23:16.644
He has gone clear off the deep end.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.897
Well, shit, at least
he hasn't joined the other team,

23:18.981 --> 23:20.732
become a goddamn Marshal,
for Christ's sake.

23:20.816 --> 23:24.986
At least Raylan doesn't run around,
preaching Jesus and blowing up meth labs.

23:25.112 --> 23:27.989
I got control over my boy.
Can you say the same about yours?

23:28.074 --> 23:29.824
He comes to town, it's to ruin

23:29.909 --> 23:32.410
- the likes of you and me.
- Only reason my son comes to Harlan

23:32.495 --> 23:34.079
is because of your son.

23:35.998 --> 23:37.665
You're gonna give me my money.

23:38.667 --> 23:39.834
How much you want?

23:39.960 --> 23:41.920
- Fifty to start with.
- I don't have that.

23:42.004 --> 23:43.338
- How much you got?
- Nothing.

23:43.464 --> 23:45.590
- Well, then why did you ask?
- Being polite.

23:45.674 --> 23:47.008
"Polite"?

23:47.802 --> 23:48.927
Well, how about this.

23:49.011 --> 23:53.014
You've got until this time tomorrow
to come up with a better answer.

23:53.140 --> 23:54.432
Or what?

23:56.519 --> 23:58.686
Thanks for the drink.

23:58.771 --> 24:02.023
I'm sorry I missed Helen.
Give her my best, huh?

24:07.696 --> 24:09.697
I should have shot him.

24:11.033 --> 24:12.283
Or you.

24:13.494 --> 24:17.038
I got one of these for my grandson, Willy.
He loved it.

24:17.123 --> 24:19.874
He used it to terrorize his dog.

24:19.959 --> 24:22.210
You know, those Chinamen,
they get a bad rap,

24:22.336 --> 24:25.171
what with their history of
communist oppression and all.

24:25.798 --> 24:28.216
But without their cheap labor and parts,

24:28.342 --> 24:33.221
well, you couldn't get yourself
a remote-controlled helicopter for $37.99.

24:33.722 --> 24:34.806
No, sir.

24:35.891 --> 24:38.143
Well, as fascinating as this is, Mr. Lemuel,

24:38.227 --> 24:41.646
it's a different Chinese product
I came to discuss.

24:42.398 --> 24:45.984
Well, those are a little harder to come by,

24:46.402 --> 24:50.321
- and they cost a touch more than $37.99.
- Well, I'm aware of that,

24:51.031 --> 24:54.993
but I have recently been given
a stipend and a benediction

24:55.077 --> 24:58.580
that allow me
not only to proceed with a full wallet,

24:58.831 --> 25:00.206
but a full heart.

25:02.793 --> 25:04.085
I'll see what I can do.

25:16.307 --> 25:18.391
- Dewey Crowe.
- Shit.

25:18.475 --> 25:19.767
Come on, hop in.

25:19.894 --> 25:22.770
Hell with it. I'll wait for another car.

25:24.064 --> 25:25.273
Dewey.

25:26.233 --> 25:29.110
- What you doing?
- I'm hitchhiking. What's it look like?

25:29.236 --> 25:31.446
- But what's going on?
- I got nothing to say to you.

25:31.572 --> 25:35.742
Why aren't you up there at church camp with
Pastor Boyd and the other commandos?

25:35.826 --> 25:38.786
They ain't Crowder's commandos no more,
that's for damn sure.

25:38.913 --> 25:43.082
- What do you mean by that?
- Too much religion. That's why I left.

25:43.584 --> 25:46.127
I never should have come down.
There's too many rules.

25:46.253 --> 25:48.463
- What kind of rules?
- All kinds!

25:48.589 --> 25:51.591
Hell, I can't even remember them all.
They're from the Bible.

25:51.675 --> 25:53.509
They kick you out
for breaking one of God's rules?

25:53.636 --> 25:57.305
Yeah, one of them.
One lousy rule, he kicked me out.

25:58.349 --> 26:02.143
Well, what did you do?
Lie? Steal? Dance on Sunday?

26:02.311 --> 26:07.106
He called me an onanist. Bet you don't
even know what that is, smartass.

26:07.358 --> 26:10.026
- Actually, I do.
- Yeah, well, I didn't.

26:10.152 --> 26:13.363
How you think that was, Boyd running me
down in front of everybody?

26:13.656 --> 26:15.156
I don't know. Funny?

26:15.532 --> 26:17.617
- You go to hell.
- I'm just playing.

26:17.701 --> 26:20.411
So he kicked you out for jacking off, huh?

26:20.496 --> 26:23.498
Hey, Dewey Crowe, you stop right there!

26:23.624 --> 26:26.918
In name of the US Marshals Service
and the government of the United States,

26:27.002 --> 26:29.212
I hereby declare you deputized.

26:29.338 --> 26:30.380
What?

26:30.506 --> 26:33.841
You are now a duly deputized
assistant US Marshal.

26:33.968 --> 26:35.385
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

26:35.511 --> 26:37.428
It means you either assist me
in my investigation

26:37.513 --> 26:41.933
or find yourself in violation of section 39B
of the US Marshals Act,

26:42.017 --> 26:44.310
for which you might receive

26:44.395 --> 26:46.938
a sentence of not longer
than three years in the federal pen.

26:47.022 --> 26:52.694
- Bullshit! That's an abuse of federal power!
- Well, be that as it may, it is the law.

26:52.820 --> 26:55.905
Now, get in the car,
or face the consequences.

27:02.705 --> 27:05.873
Boyd really bounced you out of there
for spanking the monkey?

27:07.668 --> 27:09.836
You know, flogging the log?

27:10.713 --> 27:13.172
Polishing the German helmet?

27:14.591 --> 27:16.426
Where are you taking me?

27:17.052 --> 27:20.221
What do you mean, where am I taking you?
I'm taking you back to Boyd's.

27:20.347 --> 27:21.389
What?

27:21.515 --> 27:24.183
I was headed there already,
but this'll be much better.

27:24.268 --> 27:26.978
You'll have a badge and a gun.
Won't be loaded, of course.

27:27.062 --> 27:28.187
You got to earn that kind of trust.

27:28.272 --> 27:31.232
- You can't take me back there!
- What do you mean, I can't?

27:31.317 --> 27:34.861
You're a man of the law now.
We're on the same side, Dewey Crowe.

27:34.945 --> 27:36.070
This is bullshit.

27:36.905 --> 27:38.698
You ever hear of the OK Corral?

27:38.782 --> 27:40.867
- Does that ring a bell?
- Yeah.

27:40.951 --> 27:43.244
Well, weren't none of those men
walking with Wyatt Earp

27:43.329 --> 27:47.999
deputized before that moment.
Not the day before, not the hour before.

27:48.083 --> 27:51.627
He deputized them right then and there,
and they did their job.

27:51.754 --> 27:54.255
- They died!
- Yeah, that's true.

27:55.257 --> 27:57.216
But they died heroes, huh?

27:57.301 --> 27:59.802
This just sucks.
Will you pull over and let me out?

27:59.928 --> 28:01.637
Why did you and Boyd
blow up that meth lab?

28:01.764 --> 28:05.600
Me? That was before I got down here.
Ain't you paying attention?

28:05.684 --> 28:08.311
Well, you must have heard something.

28:10.773 --> 28:12.982
You know he killed a man
sleeping in the back of that place?

28:13.108 --> 28:16.527
And now it seems
he's killed two other men, as well.

28:19.448 --> 28:22.742
I know what you're thinking.
Only two minutes to the camp.

28:22.826 --> 28:24.911
Can't wait to show off
your shiny, new badge.

28:24.995 --> 28:27.121
He never killed them. He let them go.

28:27.206 --> 28:30.291
- Why did he blow up the lab?
- Because he hates meth.

28:30.376 --> 28:32.168
Why did he blow up that particular lab?

28:35.631 --> 28:37.673
One of his men used to be a cooker there.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.509
- Which one?
- I can't remember.

28:39.635 --> 28:42.095
- Try harder.
- Bobby something. Bobby Sue.

28:42.179 --> 28:43.429
- "Bobby Sue"?
- I don't...

28:43.514 --> 28:45.390
Will you turn the damn car around?

28:50.187 --> 28:54.148
Gentlemen, this morning,
we are looking for Bobby Joe Pecker.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.234
- Packer.
- Packer. Sorry.

28:57.069 --> 28:59.821
See? We got a warrant and everything.

29:00.406 --> 29:04.200
What, you got him
squirreled away in a mine somewhere?

29:04.743 --> 29:08.704
I don't know where he is, Raylan.
Hopefully out spreading the good word.

29:08.831 --> 29:12.208
Hey, can you ask your friends to be a
little more gentle with our belongings?

29:12.334 --> 29:15.378
We don't have much,
but we do value what we have.

29:16.839 --> 29:19.799
Well, I could, but they're
looking for a witness to murder,

29:19.883 --> 29:22.009
so I don't think they'll listen.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.763
What does that make it now,
four on the list?

29:25.848 --> 29:29.016
- What list, Raylan?
- The men you murdered.

29:30.936 --> 29:34.021
I got one on a bridge, one in a meth lab,

29:34.731 --> 29:38.067
and now these two meth cookers
we found dumped in a ditch.

29:39.736 --> 29:41.237
Are there more?

29:42.239 --> 29:44.532
You know, Raylan,
we are getting precipitously close

29:44.616 --> 29:48.077
to the moment I ask
to have my lawyer present.

29:50.122 --> 29:51.289
Yeah.

29:52.249 --> 29:55.460
I think I found out that thing about Arlo
you were gonna tell me,

29:55.544 --> 29:57.545
that could help me put him away.

29:57.629 --> 30:00.173
He was running your daddy's
protection-and-collection business

30:00.257 --> 30:02.258
while your daddy was in prison.

30:02.342 --> 30:03.885
- Was that it?
- Yeah, that's it.

30:03.969 --> 30:06.345
That was the deep, dark secret
about your daddy I was dangling.

30:06.430 --> 30:07.513
I figured as much.

30:07.598 --> 30:10.349
But do you know
who he was running collections with?

30:10.434 --> 30:13.227
- Wasn't you, was it?
- No, it wasn't me.

30:13.312 --> 30:18.524
And the only reason I'm gonna tell you this
is 'cause he is well beyond your reach.

30:19.318 --> 30:22.695
Now, far be it for me to tell you
how to run your affairs.

30:22.779 --> 30:26.741
But you might want to have a word with
the woman you are currently bedding.

30:26.825 --> 30:31.829
You see, the man who ran my daddy's
collections along with your father

30:31.914 --> 30:35.416
was Ava's late husband,
my deceased brother, Bowman.

30:35.501 --> 30:37.251
God rest his soul.

30:38.504 --> 30:40.630
Well, I thought
Ava would have told you that.

30:44.301 --> 30:46.010
Bowman? Ava's ex?

30:46.553 --> 30:48.763
That's what he said.

30:48.847 --> 30:53.017
Well, that could be bullshit,
just trying to get you all spun up.

30:53.477 --> 30:55.269
Yeah. Probably.

31:03.153 --> 31:06.531
- The last car drove off. The woods are clear.
- With alacrity!

31:07.366 --> 31:08.866
- Let's get him out of here.
- Give him a hand!

31:08.951 --> 31:10.868
Come on. Hold on!

31:12.162 --> 31:13.621
1, 2, 3.

31:17.084 --> 31:19.961
Man, that was hot! About cooked!

31:22.422 --> 31:24.465
Man, you never told me
how you knew they were coming for me.

31:24.550 --> 31:27.051
Dewey called and confessed
he broke a confidence.

31:27.135 --> 31:28.511
And how was it down there?

31:28.595 --> 31:31.055
I couldn't hear nothing.
I thought you forgot about me.

31:31.139 --> 31:32.557
Not for a second.

31:32.641 --> 31:36.394
I appreciate you going down there
for me, Bobby. I truly do.

31:36.478 --> 31:39.647
I'd do anything for you, Boyd.
You saved my soul.

31:39.731 --> 31:42.650
God does the saving, son.
I just point the way.

31:42.734 --> 31:46.362
Now, Bobby, I'm gonna have to
ask for one more favor,

31:47.155 --> 31:50.241
and I'm gonna warn you, now, it's a big one.

31:51.451 --> 31:53.494
Whatever you want, Boyd.

32:25.485 --> 32:26.777
All right. Come on. Let's go.

32:26.862 --> 32:28.321
- Hey, let go of me!
- Let's go.

32:28.405 --> 32:29.780
- Come on.
- No.

32:29.865 --> 32:30.990
- Ava.
- What?

32:31.074 --> 32:33.784
- What the hell are you doing here?
- I'm drinking.

32:33.994 --> 32:35.911
What are you doing back in Harlan?

32:35.996 --> 32:38.706
Well, this isn't Harlan. You see, Harlan's dry.

32:38.790 --> 32:41.375
You must have missed the signs.
This is Corbin.

32:41.460 --> 32:42.710
You got a death wish?

32:42.794 --> 32:46.088
This is as good a place as any for you
to interrogate me about my dead husband.

32:46.173 --> 32:49.050
I wasn't interrogating you.
I just wanted to ask you a few questions.

32:49.134 --> 32:50.468
Ask.

32:50.552 --> 32:52.887
This is not the place or the time.

32:52.971 --> 32:56.265
Why not? Isn't that why you called?
It wasn't to check up on me.

32:56.516 --> 33:00.019
It wasn't to ask me what I was wearing
in that sweet voice of yours.

33:00.103 --> 33:01.228
Ava.

33:01.980 --> 33:04.690
Well, okay, then,
let's just get it out in the open.

33:04.775 --> 33:07.151
You want to know
whether Bowman worked for Bo.

33:07.235 --> 33:09.111
You lower your voice.

33:11.573 --> 33:12.948
Can I ask you something, Raylan?

33:13.784 --> 33:16.535
You thought that
Bowman was some big-time criminal,

33:16.620 --> 33:19.914
- and I just forgot to mention that to you?
- We can discuss that in the car.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.625
Well, it's okay. I'll find my own ride home.

33:22.709 --> 33:26.379
Ava, you are beautiful and drunk.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.799
But on account of that target
Bo's got on your back,

33:29.883 --> 33:32.426
none of these boys
are gonna get within 20 feet of you.

33:32.511 --> 33:34.178
That's not true.

33:34.596 --> 33:38.849
Hestler over there. He'll take
good care of me. Won't you, Hestler?

33:39.601 --> 33:42.853
- Who's that?
- You don't remember Hestler Jones?

33:42.938 --> 33:45.439
He was the creepy kid who used to,
you know, sit in the bleachers

33:45.524 --> 33:48.192
and smile his creepy little smile?

33:48.276 --> 33:52.446
He just did eight years in the state pen
for statutory rape.

33:52.531 --> 33:54.281
He working for Bo?

33:55.409 --> 33:58.994
That would be my guess.
He's been following me around.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.624
Raylan Givens. How you been?

34:03.709 --> 34:06.210
- What brings you here, Hestler?
- Having a drink.

34:06.294 --> 34:08.670
Ava says you've been following her around.

34:09.422 --> 34:12.007
It's a small world down here.
Maybe you forgot.

34:12.092 --> 34:14.802
- Well...
- People run into each other all the time.

34:14.886 --> 34:17.929
She's just imagining I'm following her.

34:18.681 --> 34:20.766
We all have imaginations, don't we?

34:20.976 --> 34:23.686
Differentiates us from the beasts.

34:23.770 --> 34:27.231
I, for one, imagine all sorts of things.

34:29.234 --> 34:30.860
That hurt. All right.

34:31.610 --> 34:32.902
No doubt a violation of your parole.

34:32.987 --> 34:35.739
You think that's the only gun
I can get my hands on?

34:35.824 --> 34:36.907
Probably not.

34:38.118 --> 34:40.828
You broke my finger, you son of a bitch!

34:40.911 --> 34:43.748
Won't be able to pull the trigger now,
will you?

34:43.831 --> 34:46.250
- Okay. We're leaving.
- No, no, no, I'm staying.

34:46.333 --> 34:48.335
I still got my left hand, asshole!

34:48.462 --> 34:50.087
I'm not leaving you in a bar with a rapist.

34:50.172 --> 34:52.757
I'm a big girl, Raylan.
I've been taking care of myself

34:52.841 --> 34:55.426
long before you rode into town
on your white horse.

34:55.510 --> 34:56.927
All right, listen to me.

34:57.012 --> 35:01.682
You are leaving with me if I have to
arrest you and put you in handcuffs.

35:16.364 --> 35:17.698
Holy shit!

35:18.033 --> 35:19.533
Yeah.

35:19.659 --> 35:20.785
She's not dead, is she?

35:21.703 --> 35:23.537
I hope not.

35:23.622 --> 35:25.206
I was just driving along,
and she passed out.

35:25.332 --> 35:26.791
Did you put handcuffs on her?

35:26.875 --> 35:29.543
Yeah. She wouldn't listen to reason.

35:33.215 --> 35:34.799
I need her to stay at your place tonight.

35:36.384 --> 35:38.302
And why don't you take her back
to your luxury motel?

35:44.226 --> 35:45.893
Did you screw things up with her?

35:47.062 --> 35:48.813
What do you think?

35:50.398 --> 35:51.565
What's going on?

35:55.195 --> 35:56.570
There have been threats

35:56.655 --> 35:58.405
- from the Crowder family.
- Is she in danger?

35:58.532 --> 36:01.575
Nothing that could be
drawn back to you or Gary.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.661
I just need to convince her
to get out of Kentucky.

36:03.745 --> 36:06.247
And you think dumping her
handcuffed at your ex-wife's house,

36:06.331 --> 36:08.415
that's gonna do the trick?

36:09.417 --> 36:10.751
What about you?

36:10.877 --> 36:13.921
- What about me?
- You getting out of Kentucky?

36:14.923 --> 36:16.841
I already tried that.

36:23.765 --> 36:25.349
Well, are you gonna
drive closer to my house,

36:25.433 --> 36:28.519
or do you expect me
to carry her from here?

36:29.896 --> 36:32.606
Are you gonna take those handcuffs off her?

36:32.691 --> 36:35.276
I could. But you might regret that.

36:38.697 --> 36:40.281
What in the hell?

36:40.407 --> 36:42.616
How's it feel to rip off your own damn wife?

36:42.742 --> 36:43.951
I didn't steal anything.

36:44.077 --> 36:46.120
You snatched every single dollar I saved!

36:46.246 --> 36:48.163
I had to take care of things.

36:48.331 --> 36:51.000
Why didn't you have the balls to ask me
before you took my money?

36:51.126 --> 36:55.629
Your money?
You haven't had a goddamn job in 20 years!

36:56.298 --> 36:59.466
What are you doing,
digging it up now, anyway?

36:59.885 --> 37:03.637
- You finally looking to leave me?
- I damn well should.

37:13.064 --> 37:14.523
Look, Helen,

37:14.983 --> 37:17.234
I planned on filling it up again.

37:17.485 --> 37:21.655
Arlo, that money was gonna
buy us some time.

37:33.543 --> 37:34.877
You okay?

37:35.503 --> 37:38.213
No, Arlo, I'm not okay!

37:39.716 --> 37:41.342
We need to pack up and get out.

37:41.426 --> 37:43.010
Nobody's gonna run me out of Harlan.

37:43.553 --> 37:48.182
Arlo, unless you got $50,000 that
I don't know about, we got two options.

37:48.767 --> 37:51.936
We either run or you kill Bo.

38:01.863 --> 38:05.115
Welcome back, my friend,
to the show that never ends.

38:08.078 --> 38:09.703
Put your bag down.

38:10.914 --> 38:14.625
I appreciate you giving me
the heads-up on Raylan.

38:14.709 --> 38:18.337
We took care of the Bobby Joe
situation in the nick of time.

38:18.421 --> 38:20.214
Well, where is he?

38:21.049 --> 38:22.758
He's performing a great service.

38:24.386 --> 38:28.722
So, did Raylan rough you up a little bit?
I know he has before.

38:29.391 --> 38:30.474
No.

38:34.396 --> 38:36.814
Well, how did he get you to talk, then?

38:37.899 --> 38:40.567
- He deputized me.
- He did what?

38:41.653 --> 38:45.572
He said he could deputize me,
and then I had to talk.

38:48.159 --> 38:51.245
That Raylan Givens.
He sure is a clever one.

38:53.415 --> 38:56.250
Well, you know that's not true, right?

38:56.334 --> 38:59.753
- Well, I wasn't sure.
- No, you didn't have to talk.

39:01.006 --> 39:03.757
- But I'm sure you wanted to.
- No, I didn't.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.678
Not even after I humiliated you?

39:10.015 --> 39:13.350
I regret that, Dewey. Friend.

39:14.978 --> 39:16.353
That was out of line.

39:18.023 --> 39:21.275
Yes, you broke our rule
against self-pleasuring,

39:22.277 --> 39:26.697
but I should not have embarrassed you
like that in front of the others.

39:26.781 --> 39:30.200
So, I understand
why you talked to deputy Givens. I do.

39:30.702 --> 39:32.578
And I forgive you, Dewey.

39:33.872 --> 39:35.956
Thank you, Boyd. Thank...

39:36.833 --> 39:38.625
But I can't abide it.

39:38.710 --> 39:42.963
I'm sorry, son, but the work
we're doing here is too important.

39:43.048 --> 39:44.631
And I hope you understand.

39:44.716 --> 39:49.470
I don't... I don't understand.
You can't kill someone for jerking off!

39:52.807 --> 39:54.016
Boyd.

40:14.579 --> 40:15.871
Go.

40:17.123 --> 40:20.751
I could stay.
I promise not to spank it so much.

40:31.429 --> 40:33.013
Excuse me, sir?

40:33.598 --> 40:34.848
He said he had to come up here.

40:35.892 --> 40:37.226
Yeah. Hey, boss.

40:38.436 --> 40:39.603
Bobby Joe Packer?

40:40.855 --> 40:42.564
That's me.

40:43.399 --> 40:46.902
I come up here to tell you all
I'm the one who set fire to that trailer.

40:48.279 --> 40:49.738
Wasn't nobody but me.

40:49.823 --> 40:52.950
Not Boyd, not nobody
from the church, just me.

40:54.244 --> 40:58.664
And I asked God's forgiveness.
He told me to surrender, so here I am.

41:04.879 --> 41:08.340
Well, I say if you're gonna be a bear,
be a grizzly.

41:09.175 --> 41:11.969
But this, my friends, is a Kodiak.

41:26.317 --> 41:27.693
Hello?

41:32.240 --> 41:33.782
Hello, Raylan.
