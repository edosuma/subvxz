WEBVTT

00:06.740 --> 00:09.743
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.648
OH, I JUST HAD THE
MOST WONDERFUL DAY.

00:14.682 --> 00:17.351
OH, THAT'S NICE. I QUIT.

00:17.385 --> 00:19.753
- WHAT?
- GOOD, I GOT YOUR ATTENTION.

00:19.787 --> 00:22.490
NO MORE DENIAL, BURKE. SOMETHING HAS
TO BE DONE ABOUT OUR NEIGHBOR'S BIRD.

00:22.523 --> 00:25.493
- ( bird squawks )
- WHAT BIRD?

00:25.526 --> 00:28.229
THAT BIRD THAT SQUAWKS ALL DAY
LONG, YET YOU DON'T SEEM TO CARE.

00:28.262 --> 00:30.464
BUT IT DRIVES ME CRAZY, YET
YOU DO NOTHING ABOUT IT.

00:30.498 --> 00:32.366
YEAH, IT SURE WOULD BE TERRIBLE

00:32.400 --> 00:34.635
TO HAVE SOMETHING SQUAWKING
AT YOU IN YOUR HOUSE ALL DAY.

00:34.668 --> 00:36.270
( bird squawks )

00:36.304 --> 00:38.506
ALL DAY LONG IT IS DOING THAT.
IT'S LIKE A BUZZ SAW.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.374
COME ON, IT'S LIKE
NAILS ON A CHALKBOARD.

00:40.408 --> 00:43.344
IT'S LIKE LISTENING TO MY EX-WIFE'S
VOICE ASKING ME FOR MONEY.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.113
BUT WHAT DO YOU CARE, HUH?

00:45.146 --> 00:47.381
YOU'RE ALWAYS OUT AT YOUR COCKTAIL
PARTIES AND YOUR RIBBON CUTTINGS.

00:47.415 --> 00:49.317
WHOA WHOA WHOA,
THAT'S EXAGGERATING.

00:49.350 --> 00:50.718
OKAY SURE, I HAD ONE
RIBBON CUTTING TODAY

00:50.751 --> 00:52.420
AND, YEAH, THERE
WERE SOME COCKTAILS,

00:52.453 --> 00:54.388
BUT THERE WERE NONE
OF THE GOOD TINIS.

00:54.422 --> 00:56.390
- ( bird squawking )
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

00:56.424 --> 00:58.626
YOU HAVE TO GO OVER THERE RIGHT NOW AND
TALK TO YOUR NEIGHBOR ABOUT HIS BIRD.

00:58.659 --> 01:01.195
NO NO NO NO. THAT'S NOT HOW
WE DEAL WITH NEIGHBORS.

01:01.229 --> 01:03.531
WE LEAVE THEM ALONE.
WE STAY AWAY.

01:03.564 --> 01:06.767
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE WALLS
AND FENCES AND MISSILES.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.736
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE RIGHT.
I WILL GO.

01:08.769 --> 01:11.038
AFTER TRADING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON
WALL STREET FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS,

01:11.071 --> 01:12.773
I CAN NEGOTIATE ANYTHING.
I WILL TALK TO HIM.

01:12.806 --> 01:15.576
WE MAY BE MILES APART AT THE BEGINNING,
BUT I WILL FIND US SOME COMMON GROUND.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.111
NO NO, I DON'T WANT
COMMON GROUND, OKAY?

01:17.145 --> 01:19.447
I WANT MY GROUND. HE
CAN HAVE HIS GROUND.

01:19.480 --> 01:22.616
- YOU'RE JUST GONNA PRETEND THAT IT'S NOT EVEN THERE?
- YES. MY HOUSE, MY RULES.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.618
( bird squawks )

01:24.652 --> 01:26.587
MY EARDRUMS.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.589
I'M GONNA GO TALK TO THE GUY RIGHT NOW.
WHAT IS HIS NAME?

01:28.622 --> 01:30.491
UH, IT'S...

01:30.524 --> 01:33.261
UM, MR. PICKS-UP-HIS-
NEWSPAPER-IN-HIS-BATHROBE-

01:33.294 --> 01:35.496
SOME-UNDERPANTS-WOULD-BE-NICE.

01:35.529 --> 01:37.565
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW THE GUY'S NAME, DO YOU?
HAVE YOU EVEN MET HIM?

01:37.598 --> 01:39.333
YEAH SURE, I'VE MET HIM.

01:39.367 --> 01:41.502
I'VE GIVEN HIM ONE OF THESE
AND A COUPLE OF THESE.

01:41.535 --> 01:44.672
AND LAST CHRISTMAS I
GAVE HIM ONE OF THESE.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.707
( bird squawking )

01:46.740 --> 01:49.743
OKAY LOOK, I'M A VERY
REASONABLE MAN, BURKE.

01:49.777 --> 01:52.413
SO I'LL TELL YOU WHAT: I'LL GIVE
IT ONE MORE DAY, ALL RIGHT?

01:52.446 --> 01:54.248
BUT IF I HEAR ANOTHER
LITTLE BIRDIE SQUAWK,

01:54.282 --> 01:56.717
I'M GONNA SAUTE IT
IN BUTTER AND LEMON.

02:21.675 --> 02:24.778
YOU DIDN'T MAKE PARROT
PANCAKES, DID YOU?

02:24.812 --> 02:27.881
NO, I'M ADHERING TO THE INSANE
BURKE DOCTRINE OF TOTAL DENIAL.

02:27.915 --> 02:30.684
OH. WELL, IN TIME YOU'LL
COME TO APPRECIATE IT.

02:30.718 --> 02:32.152
AND THAT TIME IS NOW.

02:32.186 --> 02:33.754
DON'T TALK TO THE NEIGHBORS.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.723
HE COULD BE A VERY
REASONABLE PERSON.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.225
SEE, THERE'S YOUR FIRST PROBLEM.

02:37.258 --> 02:40.694
YOU CAN'T THINK OF A
NEIGHBOR AS A PERSON.

02:40.728 --> 02:44.632
- WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?
- "SILENCE OF THE LAMBS."

02:44.665 --> 02:48.135
- THERE'S A LOT OF VALUABLE
- HEY, DON'T LAUGH.ERE.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.703
THANKS TO THAT MOVIE
I NEVER GO A DAY

02:49.737 --> 02:52.273
WITHOUT MOISTURIZING.

02:52.306 --> 02:53.774
CAN YOU DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS?

02:53.807 --> 02:55.543
HE'S EATING CEREAL
WITH HIS MOUTH OPEN.

02:55.576 --> 02:57.645
IT'S DISGUSTING.

02:57.678 --> 03:00.848
- IT'S NOT ABOUT THE CEREAL.
- ( chuckles ) NEVER IS.

03:00.881 --> 03:03.651
LOOK, ALL I DID WAS ASK HER
TO BE IN MY VIDEO PROJECT.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.719
IT'S A DON'T-TEXT-
AND-DRIVE P.S.A.

03:05.753 --> 03:08.789
AND I SAID NO LIKE 75 TIMES.

03:08.822 --> 03:11.158
I EVEN TEXTED IT TO HIM

03:11.191 --> 03:12.926
WHILE NOT DRIVING.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.596
LENNOX, IT'S FOR A GOOD CAUSE.
HELP YOUR BROTHER OUT.

03:15.629 --> 03:18.198
NO, I AM NOT DOING A VIDEO

03:18.232 --> 03:20.368
WITH THAT CONCEITED
JOCKSTRAP MILLER COLLINS.

03:20.401 --> 03:22.803
I GOT THE VARSITY IN
MY PROJECT.IN TO BE

03:22.836 --> 03:24.805
BY USING ME AS BAIT.

03:24.838 --> 03:27.508
- IS THAT WHAT YOU DID, RYDER?
- I DID NOT USE HER AS BAIT.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.510
I MERELY PROMISED HIM
THAT SHE WOULD BE IT IN

03:29.543 --> 03:31.712
IN ORDER TO LURE HIM IN.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.547
SEE? HE DIDN'T USE YOU AS BAIT.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.749
HE PIMPED YOU OUT.

03:35.783 --> 03:37.385
LENNOX, YOU DON'T
REALLY SEEM LIKE

03:37.418 --> 03:39.387
TYPICAL JOCK GIRLFRIEND
MATERIAL TO ME.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.655
MILLER THINKS ARTSY
GIRLS ARE EASY.

03:41.689 --> 03:44.224
AND THEY'RE NOT, RIGHT?

03:44.258 --> 03:45.826
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, IT'S
JUST A LITTLE VIDEO.

03:45.859 --> 03:48.195
HERE'S A CHANCE TO USE
YOUR HOTNESS FOR GOOD.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.564
- PLEASE.
- NO, I'M NOT DOING IT.

03:50.598 --> 03:51.932
YOU KNOW, LENNOX, IF I RECALL,

03:51.965 --> 03:53.701
SOMEONE IN THIS ROOM
HAS PLANS TO DRIVE YOU

03:53.734 --> 03:55.703
ALL THE WAY TO FREMONT
THIS WEEKEND FOR A PARTY.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.671
I WOULD HATE TO SEE
SOMETHING HAPPEN

03:57.705 --> 03:59.673
TO THOSE LOVELY
LITTLE ARRANGEMENTS.

03:59.707 --> 04:00.974
WHAT IS THIS, BLACKMAIL?

04:01.008 --> 04:03.243
NO, IT'S JUST A REGULAR THREAT.

04:03.277 --> 04:07.748
- DO THE KID'S MOVIE.
- FINE. FINE.

04:07.781 --> 04:11.319
LOOK AT THAT... THE KIDS ARE WORKING
TOGETHER, NOT A PEEP OUT OF YOUR BIRD,

04:11.352 --> 04:12.620
MY HAIR'S BOUNCING AND BEHAVING.

04:12.653 --> 04:14.688
THIS DAY IS OFF
TO A GREAT START.

04:14.722 --> 04:17.891
- ( bird squawks loudly )
- I GOTTA GO!

04:22.696 --> 04:25.666
- ( crashes )
- SON OF A... GAH...

04:25.699 --> 04:27.801
- UH, HEY.
- HEY.

04:27.835 --> 04:29.770
- HI THERE. HI THERE, NEIGHBOR.
- HOW ARE YOU?

04:29.803 --> 04:33.607
I'M JOE LONGO FROM RIGHT THERE.

04:33.641 --> 04:37.445
- ARNIE... RIGHT HERE.
- OH. WELL, IT'S VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.

04:37.478 --> 04:40.247
LOOK, I'M JUST GONNA CUT RIGHT
TO THE CHASE, OKAY, ARNIE?

04:40.280 --> 04:42.483
- IT'S ABOUT YOUR BIRD.
- OH, MR. JASPER.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.418
OKAY, JASPER. SURE, YEAH.

04:44.452 --> 04:47.655
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT... IF YOU COULD
FIND A WAY TO KEEP JASPER QUIET,

04:47.688 --> 04:49.923
I PROMISE YOU I WON'T MAKE AN
ISSUE OUT OF ALL THIS JUNK.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.926
- OH, OKAY OKAY... UH, JOE, WAS IT?
- MM-HMM.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.828
LOOK, JOE, LET ME
CUT TO MY CHASE.

04:54.862 --> 04:58.766
MR. JASPER IS NOT SOME
DOG OR SOME INFANT

04:58.799 --> 05:01.635
THAT YOU CAN JUST
SLAP A MUZZLE ON.

05:01.669 --> 05:04.338
AND SECONDLY, THIS
IS NOT MY JUNK.

05:04.372 --> 05:05.806
IT BELONGS TO YOUR LADY-FRIEND.

05:05.839 --> 05:07.875
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL, SHE'S NOT
MY LADY-FRIEND, ALL RIGHT?

05:07.908 --> 05:09.843
I JUST PERFORM CERTAIN...
NO, I'M SORRY.

05:09.877 --> 05:13.347
- I PROVIDE CERTAIN SERVICES...
- EH, DON'T NEED TO KNOW.

05:13.381 --> 05:16.750
DON'T WANNA KNOW. NICE
WORK IF YOU CAN GET IT.

05:16.784 --> 05:18.686
NOW LOOK, WHILE WE'RE
ON THE SUBJECT,

05:18.719 --> 05:21.389
ALL SAID JUNK IS
A BIT UNSIGHTLY.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.323
SO WHY DON'T YOU MOVE IT

05:23.357 --> 05:25.058
FROM MY PROPERTY OVER
TO YOUR PROPERTY?

05:25.092 --> 05:27.628
SURE, I CAN DO THAT. WATCH THIS.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.430
( laughs ) READY?

05:29.463 --> 05:30.731
- THERE WE GO.
- HEY.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.833
- NOW IT'S ON MY PROPERTY.
- ( both laugh )

05:32.866 --> 05:35.603
- KEEP GOING.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN "KEEP GOING"?

05:35.636 --> 05:38.338
THE MIDDLE IS RIGHT HERE.
IT'S ON MY SIDE.

05:38.372 --> 05:40.908
- NO NO, THIS IS NOT THE MIDDLE, MY FRIEND.
- SURE, IT IS.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.776
YOU KNOW WHAT THE
MIDDLE IS, DON'T YOU?

05:42.810 --> 05:44.445
IT'S, YOU KNOW, HALFWAY
BETWEEN THINGS.

05:44.478 --> 05:46.547
OH. ( laughs )

05:46.580 --> 05:48.549
WHERE WOULD THAT BE ON MY HAND

05:48.582 --> 05:51.819
IF I TOOK AWAY ALL THE LITTLE
ONES THAT WEREN'T IN THE MIDDLE?

05:53.854 --> 05:56.690
I KNOW WE'RE NOT SHOOTING
THIS UNTIL TOMORROW, MILLER,

05:56.724 --> 05:57.991
BUT I THOUGHT IT'D
BE A GOOD IDEA

05:58.025 --> 06:00.861
FOR YOU TO BE FAMILIAR
WITH YOUR LINES.

06:00.894 --> 06:03.664
SO WHAT'S THIS
THING ABOUT AGAIN?

06:03.697 --> 06:06.033
TEXTING WHILE DRIVING.

06:06.066 --> 06:09.470
OH. EVERYBODY DOES THAT.
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

06:09.503 --> 06:13.641
WELL, I'M TAKING A BOLD STANCE
AGAINST NEEDLESS DEATH.

06:13.674 --> 06:17.344
THAT'S COOL... TWO SIDES
TO EVERY ARGUMENT.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.947
SO, UH... DID YOU TELL
LENNOX I'M IN YOUR MOVIE?

06:19.980 --> 06:22.149
OH YEAH, SHE'S
COMPLETELY PSYCHED.

06:23.851 --> 06:26.820
AW JEEZ, HIM?

06:26.854 --> 06:29.723
I THOUGHT I HAD ANOTHER DAY.

06:29.757 --> 06:32.793
I THOUGHT IT'D BE NICE
FOR MY CAST TO MEET.

06:32.826 --> 06:34.462
AND SINCE WE'RE GONNA
PLAY A COUPLE,

06:34.495 --> 06:35.863
WE SHOULD GET TO
KNOW EACH OTHER.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.666
I'M MORE THAN JUST MY
FOUR VARSITY LETTERS.

06:38.699 --> 06:40.734
I HOPE YOU LEARN THE OTHER
22 BEFORE YOU GRADUATE.

06:40.768 --> 06:43.604
WOW! WOW, YOU GUYS
HAVE CHEMISTRY.

06:43.637 --> 06:46.073
NO, I'M IN EARTH SCIENCE.

06:50.444 --> 06:52.446
OH MY GOSH, WHERE DID ALL
THIS CRAP COME FROM?

06:52.480 --> 06:53.747
YOUR LIFE.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.983
( gasps ) MY MARGARITA MAKERS!

06:56.016 --> 06:58.786
HOLA, MY THREE AMIGOS.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.454
WHAT DO YOU NEED THREE
OF THESE THINGS FOR?

07:00.488 --> 07:02.623
THIS ONE'S FOR REGULAR,
THIS ONE'S FOR STRAWBERRY

07:02.656 --> 07:05.659
AND THIS ONE IS BATTERY-POWERED
IN CASE OF A BLACKOUT.

07:05.693 --> 07:07.995
YOUR NEIGHBOR'S NOT GONNA
BE TOO HAPPY ABOUT THIS.

07:08.028 --> 07:11.599
YOUR STAIRMASTER WAS ON
TOP OF HIS DOG'S GRAVE.

07:11.632 --> 07:14.535
WHOA, YOU WENT OVER THERE? WHAT HAPPENED
TO MY DOCTRINE OF TOTAL DENIAL?

07:14.568 --> 07:16.470
I TOTALLY DENIED IT.

07:16.504 --> 07:18.138
YOU BROKE THE RULES? THE
RULES OF THE HOUSE?

07:18.171 --> 07:20.674
- MY HOUSE?
- HEY, I LIVE HERE TOO, REMEMBER?

07:20.708 --> 07:22.042
YEAH, OF COURSE I REMEMBER.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.645
ALL MY STUFF WAS OUTSIDE
BECAUSE YOU'RE IN MY BASEMENT.

07:24.678 --> 07:26.446
YOU COULD SWITCH IF YOU'D LIKE.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.448
ARNIE DOESN'T WANNA HAVE
TO LOOK AT ALL YOUR JUNK.

07:28.482 --> 07:31.685
WHY? I HAVE TO LOOK AT HIS EVERY
TIME HE PICKS UP THE PAPER.

07:31.719 --> 07:34.622
LOOK, YOU COULD
TELL YOUR PAL ARNIE

07:34.655 --> 07:36.757
THAT I OWN HALF THE
LAND OUT THERE.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.592
ACTUALLY YEAH, WE GOT
TO TALKING ABOUT THAT

07:38.626 --> 07:39.893
AND THERE WAS A
SLIGHT DISAGREEMENT

07:39.927 --> 07:41.729
AS TO THE EXACT LOCATION
OF THE PROPERTY LINE.

07:41.762 --> 07:44.698
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TREAT
NEIGHBORS AS HUMAN BEINGS, OKAY?

07:44.732 --> 07:46.700
NO GOOD CAN COME OF IT.

07:46.734 --> 07:48.569
- ( knocks )
- OH MY GOD! OKAY, SEE? LOOK AT THIS.

07:48.602 --> 07:49.937
THERE'S SOMEONE
KNOCKING AND WAVING.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.939
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
YOU OPEN UP THE FLOODGATES

07:51.972 --> 07:55.743
TO PEOPLE WHO FEEL FREE
TO ENGAGE WITH US.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.678
OKAY, THAT'S ROLAND. HE'S
THE LAND SURVEYOR I HIRED

07:57.711 --> 07:59.212
TO GET TO THE
BOTTOM OF ALL THIS.

08:00.648 --> 08:02.449
YOU HIRED A SURVEYOR?

08:02.482 --> 08:05.619
WELL, TECHNICALLY YOU DID BECAUSE
YOUR NAME'S ON THE CREDIT CARD.

08:05.653 --> 08:07.621
BUT LOOK, HE'S GONNA GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS,

08:07.655 --> 08:10.591
TELL US WHERE THE EXACT PROPERTY LINE
IS SO WE CAN PUT OUR MINDS AT EASE.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.826
ROLAND, MEET COUNCILWOMAN BURKE.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.895
HEY, I RECOGNIZE YOU FROM
YOUR CAMPAIGN POSTER.

08:14.928 --> 08:18.732
- OH, GOOD PICTURE, HUH?
- EH. I VOTED FOR THE OLD WHITE GUY.

08:18.766 --> 08:21.001
HOW ABOUT WE JUMP TO THE PART WHERE...
I DON'T KNOW...

08:21.034 --> 08:23.804
YOU, LIKE, DO YOUR JOB AND SHOW
US WHERE THE PROPERTY LINE IS?

08:23.837 --> 08:25.205
- SURE.
- LET'S GO OUTSIDE AND TAKE A LOOK.

08:25.238 --> 08:27.608
NOT NECESSARY.

08:27.641 --> 08:30.678
YOUR PROPERTY LINE
RUNS RIGHT ALONG...

08:30.711 --> 08:33.547
HERE.

08:33.581 --> 08:35.549
WAIT WAIT WAIT.
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE,

08:35.583 --> 08:37.651
BECAUSE THAT WOULD MEAN THAT...
OH MY GOD!

08:37.685 --> 08:39.720
WHAT'S-HIS-NAME OWNS
HALF MY DINING ROOM!

08:39.753 --> 08:43.123
- ARNIE.
- BIG HELP THERE, JOE.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.167
JOE, WHAT I SAID
WAS VERY SIMPLE:

08:54.201 --> 08:57.104
DON'T TALK TO THE NEIGHBOR.
AND WHAT WORD WAS UNCLEAR?

08:57.137 --> 08:59.206
"DON'T," "TALK,"
"NEIGHBOR," "IDIOT"?

08:59.239 --> 09:01.842
OH WAIT, I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
I JUST IMPLIED IT.

09:03.611 --> 09:06.246
FIRST OF ALL, BURKE, AS ALWAYS I WANNA
THANK YOU FOR NOT OVERREACTING.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.616
AND SECONDLY, YOU AND I KNOW
WHERE THE PROPERTY LINE IS,

09:08.649 --> 09:11.118
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT ARNIE
KNOWS WHERE THE PROPERTY LINE IS.

09:11.151 --> 09:14.855
HE'S A VERY SIMPLE MAN. HIS BEST
FRIEND HAS FEATHERS AND A BEAK.

09:14.888 --> 09:18.158
HOW CAN I ENJOY EATING IN MY DINING
ROOM KNOWING IT'S HIS DINING ROOM?

09:18.191 --> 09:20.661
WELL, THERE IS ONE OPTION...
PRESCRIPTIVE EASEMENT.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.295
IF YOU'RE OPENLY USING
YOUR NEIGHBOR'S LAND

09:22.329 --> 09:24.665
FOR A SPECIFIC PERIOD OF
TIME, YOU ASSUME OWNERSHIP.

09:24.698 --> 09:25.966
OOH, I LIKE THAT.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.768
PRESCRIPTIVE EASEMENT
TAKES FIVE YEARS.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.036
HOW LONG HAVE YOU LIVED HERE?

09:29.069 --> 09:31.772
UH, FOUR YEARS AND
10 1/2-ISH MONTHS.

09:31.805 --> 09:33.607
THEN IN SIXISH WEEKS
IT'S ALL GOOD.

09:33.641 --> 09:35.643
SEE? LOOK AT THAT. NO WORRIES.

09:35.676 --> 09:37.645
UNCLENCH THE BUTT CHEEKS.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.747
UNLESS YOUR NEIGHBOR
CONTESTS IT.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.214
THEN YOU START
TEARING DOWN WALLS.

09:41.248 --> 09:44.918
NOTICE HOW MY BUTT
HAS RECLENCHED.

09:44.952 --> 09:47.587
NO THANKS.

09:47.621 --> 09:49.589
LOOK, WE CAN BEAT
THIS, ALL RIGHT?

09:49.623 --> 09:52.259
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS ACT LIKE NORMAL
NEIGHBORS FOR THE NEXT SIX WEEKS.

09:52.292 --> 09:54.762
EXACTLY, NORMAL NEIGHBORS.
OKAY YEAH, WE CAN DO THAT.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.864
- AGREED?
- YES, AGREED.

09:56.897 --> 09:59.299
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT WE JUST AGREED ON SOMETHING.
- THAT'S KIND OF WEIRD.

09:59.332 --> 10:02.169
THAT NEVER HAPPENS.
TAKE A PICTURE, OKAY?

10:02.202 --> 10:04.037
THERE. OKAY.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.073
- HERE.
- ALL RIGHT.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.846
OKAY, MILLER, HERE'S
YOUR BACKSTORY:

10:12.880 --> 10:15.783
YOU'RE THE TEAM QUARTERBACK, ONLY ONE THING
ON YOUR MIND... TEXTING YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

10:15.816 --> 10:18.251
- GOT IT, COACH.
- CAN WE JUST MOVE THIS ALONG?

10:18.285 --> 10:20.754
AND LENNOX, YOU'RE A TYPICAL
DITZY GIGGLY GIRL...

10:20.788 --> 10:22.322
- I DON'T DO DITZY.
- THAT'S FOR SURE.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.324
I READ YOUR POETRY
ON THE SCHOOL BLOG.

10:24.357 --> 10:26.226
YOU READ?

10:26.259 --> 10:29.129
I MEAN... THANK YOU.

10:29.162 --> 10:30.263
SHE SHOULDN'T BE DITZY.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.165
HER CHARACTER SHOULD
BE JUST LIKE HER...

10:32.199 --> 10:35.268
SMART AND, YOU KNOW, DIFFERENT.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.137
HUH.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.272
UH, FINE FINE. REWRITE.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.608
YOU'RE ACTUALLY AN
INTELLECTUAL TEEN POET

10:41.641 --> 10:44.745
WHO'S DRIVING TO A
BIG POETRY PARTY

10:44.778 --> 10:46.847
WHERE EVERYBODY'S RHYMING
UNTIL THEY PASS OUT.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.982
THERE YOU GO, KID.
WAS THAT SO HARD?

10:49.016 --> 10:51.752
SO YOU'RE TEXTING
YOUR BOYFRIEND.

10:51.785 --> 10:53.987
AND IN A MOMENT OF CRUEL IRONY,

10:54.021 --> 10:56.256
THE TWO TEXTING LOVERS CRASH
HEADFIRST INTO EACH OTHER

10:56.289 --> 10:59.626
INTO A BALL OF FLAME
AND THEY DIE.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.361
THAT'S SO SAD...

11:01.394 --> 11:04.031
YOUNG LOVE AT THE VERY
MOMENT OF ITS FIRST BLOOM?

11:04.064 --> 11:08.035
CRUSHED, TORN ASUNDER LIKE A...

11:08.068 --> 11:10.738
QUARTERBACK'S KNEE.

11:10.771 --> 11:13.173
YOU KNOW, MILLER,
YOU SURPRISE ME.

11:13.206 --> 11:16.176
OKAY, EVERYONE, EYES ON ME.

11:16.209 --> 11:19.112
AND SO WE LEARN NOT
TO TEXT AND DRIVE.

11:19.146 --> 11:20.881
WHY CAN'T WE BE IN THE SAME CAR?

11:20.914 --> 11:23.250
IF SHE WERE MY GIRLFRIEND, I WOULD
NEVER WANNA BE APART FROM HER.

11:23.283 --> 11:25.418
BECAUSE IF YOU WERE
IN THE SAME CAR,

11:25.452 --> 11:27.154
YOU WOULDN'T BE
TEXTING EACH OTHER.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.756
AND YOU HAVE TO BE
TEXTING EACH OTHER

11:28.789 --> 11:31.091
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
CAUSES THE CRASH!

11:31.124 --> 11:33.460
HERE, LET ME SHOW YOU.

11:35.128 --> 11:37.397
OKAY, THIS CAR CRASHES
INTO THIS CAR.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.266
BIG BALL OF FLAME, THE END.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.301
- THAT'S THE MESSAGE.
- WHY DO WE HAVE TO DIE?

11:41.334 --> 11:45.072
I MEAN, LOOK, IT'S OKAY IF I
HAVE TO DIE, BUT SHE SHOULDN'T.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.175
THAT WOULD BE UNBEARABLE.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.844
YOU KNOW, HE'S GOT A POINT.

11:50.878 --> 11:52.312
I COULD JUST BREAK MY LEG.

11:52.345 --> 11:54.281
AND I WOULD VISIT YOU
EVERY DAY IN THE HOSPITAL

11:54.314 --> 11:57.250
AND BRING YOU FLOWERS AND WRITE
COOL STUFF ON YOUR CAST.

11:57.284 --> 11:59.853
- AW, YOU WOULD?
- NO NO NO.

11:59.887 --> 12:01.855
YOU'RE CHANGING
THE ENTIRE MOVIE.

12:01.889 --> 12:04.057
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
I'LL FAIL VISUAL ARTS,

12:04.091 --> 12:07.160
AND NOBODY FAILS VISUAL ARTS.
THAT'S WHY I TOOK IT.

12:07.194 --> 12:10.463
SO YOU FAIL... IN
THE SERVICE OF ART.

12:10.497 --> 12:13.233
YEAH, THAT "F" WILL
BE A BADGE OF HONOR.

12:13.266 --> 12:16.203
NO NO, I DON'T WANT A BADGE OF
FREAKIN' HONOR. I WANT AN EASY "A."

12:20.273 --> 12:24.077
UGH, WHAT A DAY.

12:24.111 --> 12:26.313
WHERE ARE THOSE DAMN
MARGARITA MAKERS?

12:26.346 --> 12:29.049
- ( Mr. Jasper squawking ) -
WHOA, THAT BIRD IS REALLY LOUD.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.918
IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S
RIGHT HERE IN MY HOUSE.

12:30.951 --> 12:34.955
- THERE'S A FUNNY THING ABOUT THAT...
- HEY, NEIGHBOR.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.756
MEL, YOU REMEMBER OUR
NEIGHBOR ARNIE, RIGHT?

12:36.790 --> 12:38.458
WHY, WHAT A TOTAL SURPRISE!

12:38.491 --> 12:41.228
YEAH WELL, IT'S GOOD
TO FINALLY MEET YOU.

12:41.261 --> 12:44.197
- THIS IS MR. JASPER.
- OH, WE... WE HAVEN'T MET?

12:44.231 --> 12:46.499
- I... I FEEL LIKE WE'VE MET.
- NO NO NO.

12:46.533 --> 12:49.837
YOU GIVE ME A LITTLE WAVE EVERY
NOW AND THEN WHEN YOU SEE ME,

12:49.870 --> 12:52.772
BUT THEN YOU TALK INTO YOUR
PRETEND CELL PHONE AND...

12:52.806 --> 12:55.308
WELL, I... YOU KNOW, IT IS
GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN, ARNIE.

12:55.342 --> 12:59.112
- HEH HEH HEY, CHRISTMAS CAME EARLY.
- ( Mr. Jasper squawking )

12:59.146 --> 13:02.415
SO, HOW DID THIS LONG-OVERDUE
NEIGHBOR FEST COME TO BE?

13:02.449 --> 13:05.953
WELL, YOUR SERVICE
PROVIDER JOE OVER THERE

13:05.986 --> 13:08.055
INVITED ME IN FOR A BEER.

13:08.088 --> 13:11.258
OH. WELL, I COULDN'T BE MORE
DELIGHTED IF I HAD KNOWN.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.260
THAT'S WHAT NORMAL
NEIGHBORS DO...

13:13.293 --> 13:15.262
YOU KNOW, JUST
CHATTING AND TALKING.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.430
- DEFYING.
- OH, WHAT'S THAT?

13:17.464 --> 13:19.399
- YOU GOT SOME SAUCE GOING ON THERE?
- OH YEAH.

13:19.432 --> 13:22.269
OH, JUST LIKE MY MOM USED
TO MAKE BACK IN JERSEY.

13:22.302 --> 13:25.372
- YOU'RE FROM JERSEY TOO? NO WAY. WHERE?
- PARSIPPANY.

13:25.405 --> 13:28.842
THAT'S THE STYROFOAM PEANUT
CAPITAL OF THE TRI-STATE AREA.

13:28.876 --> 13:31.344
GET OUTTA HERE. SECAUCUS.

13:31.378 --> 13:32.545
- NO!
- YEAH.

13:32.579 --> 13:35.248
- Both: HEY!
- BOOM! ( laughs )

13:35.282 --> 13:37.184
LOOK AT THAT... WE FOUND A
LITTLE COMMON GROUND, HUH?

13:37.217 --> 13:39.119
YOU KNOW WHAT, ARNIE? WHY
DON'T YOU JOIN US FOR DINNER?

13:39.152 --> 13:43.523
- WHAT?
- WHAT A GREAT IDEA IS WHAT MEL MEANS.

13:43.556 --> 13:47.160
I WILL. JUST GOTTA GO
PUT ON MY EATING PANTS.

13:47.194 --> 13:48.862
- ( Mr. Jasper squawks )
- OH HEY, LISTEN.

13:48.896 --> 13:51.298
WILL YOU WATCH MR. JASPER FOR ME?
HE LOVES KISSES.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.000
PUT A SUNFLOWER
SEED ON YOUR TONGUE

13:53.033 --> 13:54.501
AND HE'LL EAT IT RIGHT OFF.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.236
OR BITE YOU.

13:58.138 --> 14:00.107
HOW THE HELL DID THAT
MAN END UP IN MY HOUSE?

14:00.140 --> 14:01.574
LOOK, I WAS OUT ON THE DRIVEWAY.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.276
HE COMES UP TO ME.
WE STARTED TALKING.

14:03.310 --> 14:05.278
HE TOLD ME HE WAS OUT OF BEER.
I SAID, "COME GRAB ONE."

14:05.312 --> 14:07.380
- THAT'S WHAT NORMAL NEIGHBORS DO.
- NO, WRONG WRONG.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.149
NORMAL NEIGHBORS WAVE
FROM A DISTANCE.

14:09.182 --> 14:13.253
AND IF YOU SMELL SOMETHING BAD
FOR A FEW WEEKS, YOU CALL 911.

14:13.286 --> 14:15.188
IF I DIDN'T TALK TO HIM, IT
WOULD HAVE LOOKED SUSPICIOUS.

14:15.222 --> 14:16.890
HE DOESN'T KNOW, DOES HE,

14:16.924 --> 14:19.426
ABOUT THE PROPERTY
YOU-KNOW-WHAT?

14:19.459 --> 14:21.494
YOU THINK THE BIRD'S GONNA
RAT YOU OUT, DO YOU?

14:21.528 --> 14:23.296
YEAH. YEAH, MUGSY, I DO.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.366
- HEY, MR. JASPER.
- ( squawks )

14:26.399 --> 14:28.268
SO HOW'D THE SHOOT GO?

14:28.301 --> 14:30.537
LOUSY. I HAD TO LET
GO OF MY STAR.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.405
WHOA, YOU FIRED YOUR SISTER?
THAT'S HEARTLESS.

14:32.439 --> 14:35.909
- NO NO, I FIRED MILLER.
- OH, WHO CARES?

14:35.943 --> 14:38.946
AND NOW I HAVE TO GO FIND ANOTHER
CONCEDED JOCK TO REPLACE HIM.

14:38.979 --> 14:41.248
I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAVE TO TALK
TO FOOTBALL PLAYERS AGAIN.

14:41.281 --> 14:44.417
IF I'M NOT BACK BY 6:00,
LOOK FOR ME IN MY LOCKER.

14:44.451 --> 14:46.586
THE COMBINATION IS MY BIRTHDAY.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.157
OH GREAT, YOU'RE BACK.

14:50.190 --> 14:51.591
AND I SEE YOU
DRESSED FOR DINNER.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.593
ARE YOU READY FOR SOME
JERSEY COOKING, ARNIE?

14:53.626 --> 14:56.263
OH YEAH, I'VE GOT
PLENTY OF ROOM.

14:56.296 --> 14:59.232
BUT FIRST, HAVE A LOOK AT THIS.

14:59.266 --> 15:01.068
OH BOY.

15:01.101 --> 15:04.104
SNAKE SNAKE. YOU
SEE THAT, RIGHT?

15:04.137 --> 15:05.405
UH, Y-YEP. YEP, I DO.

15:05.438 --> 15:09.142
IT'S A BIG BIG BEAUTIFUL
SNAKE, SO BE NICE.

15:09.176 --> 15:11.244
IT'S A JUNGLE CARPET PYTHON.

15:11.278 --> 15:13.146
- SHE'S VERY FRIENDLY.
- OH.

15:13.180 --> 15:14.647
HEY, DO YOU GUYS HAVE ANY MICE?

15:14.681 --> 15:16.984
BECAUSE I COULD
JUST LET HER LOOSE

15:17.017 --> 15:18.518
AND SHE'D TAKE CARE
OF THAT FOR YOU.

15:18.551 --> 15:20.220
YOU KNOW HOW THEY EAT?

15:20.253 --> 15:23.223
THEY SWALLOW THE ANIMAL WHOLE,
THEN REGURGITATE THE BONES.

15:23.256 --> 15:25.425
- SHE LIKES YOU.
- OOH!

15:25.458 --> 15:29.162
WELL YEAH, I'M NOT... I'M
NOT MUCH OF A SNAKE PERSON

15:29.196 --> 15:31.931
BUT, UM, WELL, THOSE...

15:31.965 --> 15:35.035
THOSE BEADY LITTLE EYES
SURE DO MELT YOUR HEART.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.939
ARNIE, YOU ARE OUR GUEST. FEEL FREE
TO SIT ANYWHERE THAT YOU'D LIKE.

15:39.973 --> 15:42.042
OH WELL, GREAT. HEY
LISTEN, IN THAT CASE

15:42.075 --> 15:44.344
I'LL TAKE THE CHAIR
THAT'S ON MY PROPERTY.

15:44.377 --> 15:45.678
( laughs )

15:45.712 --> 15:48.448
YOUR... YOUR PROPERTY?

15:48.481 --> 15:51.184
YEAH. WHEN ME AND YOUR
LIVE-IN STUDMUFFIN

15:51.218 --> 15:53.253
HAD OUR LITTLE CHIT-CHAT
ABOUT PROPERTY LINES,

15:53.286 --> 15:55.522
I HIRED A SURVEYOR TO
SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON.

15:55.555 --> 15:58.058
AND FRANKLY, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT.

15:58.091 --> 16:01.061
I THOUGHT I'D SEE HOW THIS
NEIGHBORLY THING GOES.

16:01.094 --> 16:04.998
- HERE YOU GO, SWEET PEA.
- ( rustling )

16:06.299 --> 16:08.268
SHE LIKES YOUR SAUCE.

16:18.145 --> 16:21.514
- OKAY, NOW DON'T FREAK OUT, BUT I HAD TO REPLACE MILLER.
- I'M OKAY.

16:21.548 --> 16:23.683
HE KIND OF THOUGHT YOU
WERE A TOOL ANYWAY.

16:23.716 --> 16:27.320
WE'RE GOING OUT SATURDAY.

16:27.354 --> 16:29.422
UH, WHO'S MY NEW CO-STAR?

16:29.456 --> 16:31.391
OH, GREAT GUY. YOU'RE
GONNA LOVE HIM.

16:31.424 --> 16:33.093
WE'RE REALLY LUCKY
HE WAS AVAILABLE.

16:33.126 --> 16:36.663
- YOU READY?
- LET'S GET THIS OVER WITH.

16:39.432 --> 16:42.235
WOW. WHERE'D YOU GET
THE AWESOME WIG?

16:42.269 --> 16:44.537
FROM SCHOOL... LAST YEAR'S
PRODUCTION OF "GREASE."

16:44.571 --> 16:47.507
AND IT WAS IN THE DUMPSTER.
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

16:47.540 --> 16:50.543
IT WAS ON TOP, MOSTLY.

16:53.046 --> 16:55.648
JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR, THIS
IS FOR YOUR CLASS, RIGHT?

16:55.682 --> 16:58.518
SO IF I SEE ANY OF THIS ON YouTube,
I'M GONNA CHOKE YOU IN YOUR SLEEP.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.353
I ACCEPT YOUR TERMS.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.657
HE SAT RIGHT IN THERE AND
SAID HE OWNED HALF THE ROOM

17:04.691 --> 17:07.460
AND THEN HE STROKED THE
HEAD OF HIS SERPENT.

17:07.494 --> 17:09.162
WELL, I CAN HELP WITH
THE PROPERTY DISPUTE.

17:09.196 --> 17:11.631
I'M TELLING YOU, THIS GUY IS A
TICKING TIME BOMB, YOU KNOW?

17:11.664 --> 17:13.633
BIRDS, SNAKES... WHO KNOWS
WHAT'S COMING NEXT?

17:13.666 --> 17:16.035
WELL, LET ME TAKE A LOOK
AT YOUR TITLE REAL QUICK.

17:16.069 --> 17:17.404
WHOA, THE JACKET'S PRETTY SLICK.

17:17.437 --> 17:19.439
THANK YOU. I'VE GROWN
QUITE FOND OF IT.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.374
- I SEE THAT YOU'VE LAWYERED UP.
- YES.

17:21.408 --> 17:24.477
YES, I HAVE INDEED. WE TRIED IT
YOUR WAY, ALL FRIENDLY-LIKE,

17:24.511 --> 17:26.679
BUT NOW WE'RE DOING IT BURKE
STYLE AND TAKING NO PRISONERS.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.415
AND MAKING NO SENSE.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.550
YOU SURE YOU WANNA GO
NUCLEAR WITH THIS THING?

17:30.583 --> 17:32.051
HEY, ARNIE STARTED IT.

17:32.085 --> 17:33.553
WELL, TECHNICALLY
YOU STARTED IT,

17:33.586 --> 17:35.388
BUT I CAN'T SUE YOU BECAUSE
YOU'VE GOT NOTHING.

17:35.422 --> 17:36.723
SO WHEN ARE YOU GONNA
ADMIT YOU'RE WRONG?

17:36.756 --> 17:38.425
LOOK, I AM NOT WRONG, OKAY?

17:38.458 --> 17:40.593
BECAUSE THERE IS WRONG AND
THEN THERE IS NOT YET RIGHT.

17:40.627 --> 17:43.796
AND AT THIS POINT IN TIME,
I AM JUST NOT YET RIGHT.

17:43.830 --> 17:46.533
WOW, YOU SHOULD BE IN POLITICS.

17:46.566 --> 17:49.169
BASED ON WHEN YOU TOOK
TITLE OF THE PROPERTY,

17:49.202 --> 17:51.438
WE HAVE A REASONABLE EXPECTATION
OF A POSITIVE OUTCOME.

17:51.471 --> 17:54.341
- HOWEVER, IF THE OTHER PARTY TAKES A HOSTILE POSITION...
- ( shouting )

17:54.374 --> 17:57.110
WHOA. OH, IT'S HIM! IT'S THE PERSON.
IT'S THE NEIGHBOR.

17:57.144 --> 17:58.711
- DO YOU WANT ME TO GO TALK TO HIM?
- NO NO NO.

17:58.745 --> 18:02.415
I JUST WANT YOU TO SIT HERE, ACT
NORMAL, IGNORE HIM. EAT SOME NUTS.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.584
I'M STAYING OUT OF THIS. WHY
DON'T YOU GO SEE WHAT HE WANTS?

18:04.617 --> 18:06.686
- I DON'T REALLY CARE WHAT HE WANTS.
- OKAY, FINE.

18:06.719 --> 18:09.756
- I'LL GO SEE WHAT HE WANTS.
- ( whooshing noises )

18:09.789 --> 18:13.126
- SO WHAT'S GOING ON?
- HE'S GOT A FIRE EXTINGUISHER.

18:13.160 --> 18:15.628
- ( whooshing continues )
- AND HE'S PUTTING OUT A FIRE IN YOUR GARAGE.

18:15.662 --> 18:17.664
WHAT?!

18:19.199 --> 18:23.136
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE THE FIRE
WAS CONTAINED IN THIS...

18:23.170 --> 18:25.305
STRETCH OF TINY HIGHWAY.

18:25.338 --> 18:27.607
NO LOSS OF LIFE, LUCKILY.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.343
I GOT HERE JUST IN
THE NICK OF TIME.

18:30.377 --> 18:32.145
KIND OF HEROIC, SEEMS TO ME.

18:32.179 --> 18:34.481
ARNIE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT
WAS VERY NEIGHBORLY OF YOU.

18:34.514 --> 18:37.550
- ISN'T THAT RIGHT, MEL?
- YES YES, APPARENTLY IT WAS.

18:37.584 --> 18:41.454
YOU KNOW, I'M NO ARSONIST, AND I
HAVE THE ACQUITTAL TO PROVE IT,

18:41.488 --> 18:44.257
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE SOMEONE
WAS USING A BLOWTORCH HERE.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.226
SORRY, AUNT MEL.

18:46.259 --> 18:49.128
I GUESS I GOT A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY
WITH THE WHOLE FIERY-DEATH-CRASH THING.

18:49.162 --> 18:52.365
THE GOOD NEWS IS I
GOT ALL MY SHOTS.

18:52.399 --> 18:55.535
BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY
GOOD ENOUGH NEWS, IS IT?

18:57.604 --> 19:00.540
YOU'RE LUCKY I WAS WALKING BY.

19:00.573 --> 19:03.743
I TRIED TO GET YOUR ATTENTION
THROUGH THE WINDOW.

19:03.776 --> 19:06.413
NO WAY. REALLY? THOSE
DOUBLE-PANED WINDOWS

19:06.446 --> 19:08.381
MUST REALLY BLOCK OUT THE SOUND.

19:08.415 --> 19:10.650
( chuckles ) AND THE SIGHT.

19:10.683 --> 19:13.520
LOOK, ARNIE, MAYBE
I HAVEN'T BEEN

19:13.553 --> 19:15.388
THE BEST NEIGHBOR
OVER THE YEARS.

19:15.422 --> 19:18.425
- POSSIBLY THE WORST.
- ANYWAY, I JUST WANNA SAY

19:18.458 --> 19:21.494
THAT I AM REALLY GLAD
THAT YOU LIVE NEXT DOOR.

19:21.528 --> 19:23.396
OH, THANK YOU.

19:23.430 --> 19:25.498
WOW.

19:25.532 --> 19:28.235
HEY, WHY DON'T YOU TWO
COME ON OVER THIS WEEKEND?

19:28.268 --> 19:30.237
I'M HAVING A LITTLE BABY SHOWER.

19:30.270 --> 19:33.540
MY TARANTULA'S EGG
SAC'S ABOUT TO BLOW.

19:33.573 --> 19:36.376
- WOULDN'T MISS IT.
- ( door closes )

19:38.611 --> 19:40.880
ALL RIGHT, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
HIT ME OVER THE HEAD WITH IT.

19:40.913 --> 19:44.351
- NO, YOU'RE RIGHT, I DON'T HAVE TO.
- WE WERE LUCKY.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.353
I'D HATE TO THINK WHAT COULD
HAVE HAPPENED TO OUR HOUSE.

19:46.386 --> 19:47.754
WHOA, WAIT A MINUTE. BACK UP.

19:47.787 --> 19:51.358
YOU JUST SAID "OUR HOUSE." I
THOUGHT THIS WAS YOUR HOUSE.

19:51.391 --> 19:55.462
NO, OUR HOUSE... YOU KNOW,
ME, LENNOX AND RYDER.

19:55.495 --> 19:57.697
AND YOU KNOW... I DON'T KNOW...
SOME OTHER PEOPLE LIKE...

19:57.730 --> 20:00.367
( blows raspberry ) FINE, YOU.

20:08.475 --> 20:11.210
ALL RIGHT. I'VE GOT MY POPCORN.
FIRE IT UP.

20:11.244 --> 20:15.582
I GIVE YOU THE DIRECTOR'S CUT.

20:15.615 --> 20:19.486
- ( buttons clicking )
- "I'll see you at the big game/poetry slam.

20:19.519 --> 20:21.521
LOL."

20:23.290 --> 20:27.560
"Oh, Brad, I love you as much as I
love poetry and spirited debate."

20:27.594 --> 20:29.529
- ( car approaching )
- OMG!

20:29.562 --> 20:31.564
Is that Brad's car heading
straight towards me?

20:31.598 --> 20:33.900
I was too busy
texting to notice.

20:33.933 --> 20:37.537
Oh no, is that Sally's car?

20:37.570 --> 20:39.972
- Cruel irony.
- ( tires screeching )

20:40.006 --> 20:43.410
- Ahh!
- No!

20:46.913 --> 20:50.350
If only I hadn't been
texting while driving.

20:50.383 --> 20:52.519
I guess I learned my lesson.

20:52.552 --> 20:55.622
But too late. Oh.

20:55.655 --> 20:57.624
( discordant note )

20:57.657 --> 21:00.293
( Lennox screams )

21:00.327 --> 21:03.563
- THAT WAS PRETTY GRAPHIC.
- I KNOW, RIGHT?

21:03.596 --> 21:05.598
THOSE WEREN'T MY BEST TAKES.

21:05.632 --> 21:07.767
I CAN ASSURE YOU THEY WERE.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.769
SO WHAT DID YOUR TEACHER
SAY ABOUT THIS?

21:09.802 --> 21:11.237
- I GOT AN "A."
- NO WAY.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.605
- YEAH.
- YEAH!

21:12.639 --> 21:14.607
OH, AND I ALSO HAVE TO MEET
WITH THE SCHOOL COUNSELOR

21:14.641 --> 21:16.676
ONCE A WEEK FROM NOW ON.

21:16.709 --> 21:18.945
I DON'T HAVE TO PAY
FOR THAT, RIGHT?

21:18.978 --> 21:22.515
I LOVE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. HEY!

21:22.549 --> 21:26.553
( rock music playing )
