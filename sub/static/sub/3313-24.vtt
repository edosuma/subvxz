WEBVTT

00:07.968 --> 00:09.679
"MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:09.680 --> 00:12.132
- Joey: SPOTS!
- Woman: UM, FRECKLES!

00:12.133 --> 00:13.553
- DOTS!
- MEASLES!

00:13.554 --> 00:16.306
- ACNE! SWISS CHEESE!
- SWISS CHEESE WITH ACNE!

00:16.307 --> 00:20.400
MEL, HONEY, HAVE YOU LOST COMPLETE
CONTROL OF THAT ARM OR WHAT?

00:20.401 --> 00:22.982
- ( alarm rings )
- AH! TIME'S UP.

00:22.983 --> 00:26.407
- WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?
- A THOUSAND POINTS OF LIGHT!

00:28.279 --> 00:29.949
A THOUSAND POINTS...

00:29.950 --> 00:31.861
NATE, WOULD YOU HAVE
EVER HAVE GUESSED THAT?

00:31.862 --> 00:33.993
I WOULDN'T GUESS IT NOW.
( chuckles )

00:33.994 --> 00:36.996
- COME ON. GILLIAN?
- MEL, I FEEL CLOSE ENOUGH TO YOU NOW

00:36.997 --> 00:38.078
THAT I CAN SAY THIS:

00:38.079 --> 00:40.120
THAT WAS THE WORST CLUE EVER.

00:40.121 --> 00:41.921
HEY, YOU DIDN'T SEE HER CHARADE
FOR "50 SHADES OF GREY."

00:41.922 --> 00:43.713
- MM-HMM.
- MMM.

00:43.714 --> 00:46.716
- YOU GOT IT, DIDN'T YOU?
- YEAH, BUT IT SCARRED ME.

00:46.717 --> 00:49.299
IT'S GETTING LATE.
WE SHOULD HEAD HOME.

00:49.300 --> 00:51.131
BUSTER NEEDS TO GET
WALKED AND IF WE'RE LATE,

00:51.132 --> 00:53.763
HE EXPRESSES HIS
DISAPPROVAL IN URINE.

00:53.764 --> 00:55.805
HOW ABOUT THAT?
MEL'S THE SAME WAY.

00:55.806 --> 00:58.139
( laughs ) WE'LL GET
YOU LEFTOVERS, GUYS.

00:59.680 --> 01:01.271
HEY, DID YOU THINK IT WENT WELL?

01:01.272 --> 01:03.983
I THINK FOR OUR FIRST COUPLES
DATE, IT WAS OFF-THE-CHARTS GOOD.

01:03.984 --> 01:06.106
- I THINK THEY LIKE US.
- YEAH, LET'S ASK 'EM

01:06.107 --> 01:07.687
IF THEY WANNA GO
OUT WITH US AGAIN.

01:07.688 --> 01:09.068
ARE YOU KIDDING? THE
WORST THING YOU COULD DO

01:09.069 --> 01:10.740
ON A FIRST DATE IS
SEEM DESPERATE.

01:10.741 --> 01:12.653
OH, BUT I REALLY WANT
THEM TO BE OUR FRIENDS!

01:14.074 --> 01:15.865
MEL, WE'VE GONE OUT WITH
OTHER COUPLES BEFORE.

01:15.866 --> 01:18.077
YEAH, BUT WE'VE NEVER
MADE IT TO A SECOND DATE.

01:18.078 --> 01:21.000
THIS THING YOU AND I HAVE IS
FUN, BUT IT'S GONNA WEAR OFF.

01:21.001 --> 01:23.003
WE'RE GONNA NEED OTHER PEOPLE.

01:25.206 --> 01:26.207
TO...

01:27.708 --> 01:29.799
TO TALK TO, RIGHT?

01:29.800 --> 01:31.631
YES, TO TALK TO.

01:31.632 --> 01:32.882
ALL RIGHT. HEY, HOW ABOUT THIS?

01:32.883 --> 01:34.674
I START TRAINING
NATE ON THURSDAY.

01:34.675 --> 01:36.015
I'LL ASK HIM IF HE AND GILLIAN

01:36.016 --> 01:37.807
WANNA GO OUT WITH US
AGAIN IN BETWEEN SQUATS.

01:37.808 --> 01:39.769
OOH, THAT'S GOOD, BECAUSE
IT SOUNDS CASUAL.

01:39.770 --> 01:43.183
BUT FOR NOW, LET'S JUST TELL THEM THAT
WE ENJOYED THE EVENING AND HANG BACK.

01:43.184 --> 01:45.855
TRUST ME, I KNOW
HOW COUPLES WORK.

01:45.856 --> 01:47.897
- THEY LOVE THE CHASE.
- ( scoffs )

01:47.898 --> 01:49.319
WHATEVER YOU SAY.

01:49.320 --> 01:51.152
A PHRASE I'M BECOMING
VERY FAMILIAR WITH.

01:52.943 --> 01:55.114
- HERE'S YOUR LEFTOVERS.
- THANKS, GUYS. WE HAD A GREAT TIME.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.576
- YEAH.
- WE WERE THINKING THE FOUR OF US

01:56.577 --> 01:57.997
SHOULD GET TOGETHER
NEXT WEEK FOR DINNER.

01:57.998 --> 01:59.370
YES! GREAT! DONE!

02:00.911 --> 02:02.702
WAY TO HANG BACK.

02:02.703 --> 02:05.044
- OKAY, GREAT. WE'LL MAKE A PLAN LATER.
- OKAY.

02:05.045 --> 02:07.046
COME ON, GILLIAN,
THINK OF BUSTER...

02:07.047 --> 02:10.049
- AND HIS VENGEFUL BLADDER.
- ( mouths )

02:10.050 --> 02:12.091
- BYE, GUYS.
- ( door closes )

02:12.092 --> 02:15.094
( squeals ) THEY ASKED US OUT!
'CAUSE WE'RE AWESOME!

02:15.095 --> 02:16.556
AND YOU KNOW WHAT CLINCHED IT?

02:16.557 --> 02:19.889
MY STORY ABOUT SHOPPING
FOR MELONS WITHOUT A BRA.

02:19.890 --> 02:21.140
- NEVER GETS OLD, HONEY.
- NOPE.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.762
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS PUTS
ME IN THE MOOD FOR?

02:22.763 --> 02:24.474
- SEXY TIME?
- SEXY TIME.

02:24.475 --> 02:26.566
OOH!

02:26.567 --> 02:29.148
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- WELL, JUST 'CAUSE IT'S SEXY TIME,

02:29.149 --> 02:30.731
DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT ALSO
HAS TO BE MESSY TIME.

02:31.942 --> 02:33.694
WELL, THEN I'M GONNA GET
STARTED WITHOUT YA.

02:35.115 --> 02:35.986
WIN WIN!

'CAUSE THE BODY
FOLLOWS THE MIND.

03:03.063 --> 03:05.144
THAT'S TOO MUCH THINKING FOR ME.

03:05.145 --> 03:07.186
JUST GIVE ME 10 MORE REPS THEN.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.479
YOU KNOW, NATE,

03:09.480 --> 03:12.362
MEL AND I ARE REALLY LOOKING FORWARD
TO DINNER NEXT WEEK WITH YOU GUYS.

03:12.363 --> 03:13.983
YOU KNOW WHAT RESTAURANT
I THINK WE SHOULD GO TO?

03:13.984 --> 03:16.155
WAIT A MINUTE, I'M SORRY.

03:16.156 --> 03:17.407
I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND NOW.

03:17.408 --> 03:19.198
I CAN'T PICK
RESTAURANTS ANYMORE.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.870
I CAN STILL CHOOSE
THE DAY, THOUGH.

03:20.871 --> 03:23.032
HOW DOES... HOW DOES FRIDAY
NIGHT WORK FOR YOU GUYS?

03:23.033 --> 03:25.705
- OH. FRIDAY'S BAD.
- OH, ALL RIGHT.

03:25.706 --> 03:28.788
- WHAT ABOUT SATURDAY?
- SATURDAY'S NO GOOD.

03:28.789 --> 03:30.710
OH, I SEE. I GET IT.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.041
ALL RIGHT, YOU AND
GILLIAN TALKED

03:32.042 --> 03:34.504
AND DECIDED THAT ONE OF US WAS...
BLECH!

03:34.505 --> 03:37.096
- ( chuckles ) MEL GROWS ON YOU.
- ( breathing hard )

03:37.097 --> 03:40.139
NO NO NO, I LOVE MEL. I JUST...

03:40.140 --> 03:42.011
I DON'T...

03:42.012 --> 03:44.013
THINK I LOVE MY WIFE ANYMORE.

03:44.014 --> 03:47.847
- YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
- NO.

03:47.848 --> 03:51.060
I MEAN, I LOVE GILLIAN. I'M
JUST NOT IN LOVE WITH HER.

03:51.061 --> 03:53.192
- THE FIRE'S GONE.
- YOU'RE MARRIED.

03:53.193 --> 03:54.984
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE GONE.

03:54.985 --> 03:57.447
BUT OUT IN THE WORLD, THERE'S
SO MUCH POSSIBILITY.

03:57.448 --> 04:00.199
LIKE THERE'S THIS ONE BARISTA
NEAR OUR HOUSE, ALANA.

04:00.200 --> 04:03.783
- OH MY GOD.
- WE KINDA HAVE THIS FLIRTING THING GOING ON.

04:03.784 --> 04:05.365
AFTER I TELL HER WHAT
COFFEE I'D LIKE,

04:05.366 --> 04:07.497
SHE ALWAYS SAYS...

04:07.498 --> 04:09.459
"ANYTHING ELSE?"

04:09.460 --> 04:12.131
NEXT THING YOU KNOW, SHE'LL
BE SAYING THINGS LIKE,

04:12.132 --> 04:13.963
"HERE'S YOUR CHANGE."

04:13.964 --> 04:16.175
I'M TELLING YOU,
MAN, SHE WANTS ME.

04:16.176 --> 04:18.047
I DON'T GET IT. I DON'T GET IT.

04:18.048 --> 04:20.340
YOU AND GILLIAN SEEMED
SO GOOD THE OTHER NIGHT.

04:20.341 --> 04:22.261
YEAH, "SEEMED," BUT...

04:22.262 --> 04:24.053
IT'S OVER.

04:24.054 --> 04:27.347
WHEN THE MOMENT'S RIGHT, I'M
GONNA LET HER DOWN GENTLY.

04:27.348 --> 04:30.980
WELL, THAT'S NICE. YEAH, YOU'RE
GONNA DUMP YOUR WIFE GENTLY.

04:30.981 --> 04:32.812
I'M SORRY, MAN. I HAD
TO GET IT OFF MY CHEST.

04:32.813 --> 04:34.654
PLEASE DON'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT THIS TO ANYBODY.

04:34.655 --> 04:37.106
I WON'T. I CAN KEEP A SECRET.

04:37.107 --> 04:38.988
I'M LIKE A VAULT. YOU
KNOW, I'M SMOOTH,

04:38.989 --> 04:42.782
I'M SLEEK, MADE OF STEEL.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.164
IN THAT CASE, LEMME TELL YOU ABOUT
THIS NEW PARALEGAL AT WORK.

04:45.165 --> 04:46.577
YEAH, VAULT'S FULL.

04:48.709 --> 04:51.581
OH GOD! ZANDER, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE, MAN?

04:51.582 --> 04:53.002
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
SUPPOSED TO BE IN VERMONT.

04:53.003 --> 04:55.465
I AM SUPPOSED TO BE IN
VERMONT, BUT I'M NOT.

04:55.466 --> 04:57.717
CAN WE TALK INSIDE?

04:57.718 --> 05:01.921
LOOK, IF YOU'RE HERE FOR ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR
SURPRISE CHECK-UPS ON LENNOX, SHE'S NOT HOME.

05:01.922 --> 05:02.922
THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH LENNOX.

05:02.923 --> 05:05.015
COULD YOU OPEN THE DOOR, PLEASE?

05:07.928 --> 05:10.229
I'M IN DEEP TROUBLE. I
NEED A PLACE TO HIDE OUT.

05:10.230 --> 05:12.983
WHAT? YOU KILL A GUY?

05:14.274 --> 05:16.065
'CAUSE THAT'D BE COOL.

05:16.066 --> 05:17.437
WHAT? NO, I'M AN ART STUDENT.

05:17.438 --> 05:20.440
WE CAN ONLY KILL PRE-EXISTING
MODES OF EXPRESSION.

05:20.441 --> 05:22.652
AND I'M NOT REALLY AN
ART STUDENT ANYMORE.

05:22.653 --> 05:23.993
I MADE SO MANY TRIPS
BACK TO TOLEDO,

05:23.994 --> 05:26.496
- I KINDA FLUNKED OUT.
- MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE

05:26.497 --> 05:28.498
KEPT CHECKING UP ON LENNOX
AND HER NEW BOYFRIEND.

05:28.499 --> 05:29.869
OH, THANKS FOR
POINTING THAT OUT.

05:29.870 --> 05:31.831
LOOK, I...

05:31.832 --> 05:33.663
PLEASE DON'T TELL ANYBODY I'M
HERE, ESPECIALLY LENNOX.

05:33.664 --> 05:35.505
I DON'T WANT HER TO THINK
I'M SPYING ON HER,

05:35.506 --> 05:38.918
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE I'M TOTALLY OVER HER.
BELIEVE ME.

05:38.919 --> 05:40.339
THEN WHY ARE YOU IN HER HOUSE?

05:40.340 --> 05:42.552
'CAUSE I CAN'T FACE MY DAD.
HE'S PRONE TO YELLING

05:42.553 --> 05:45.385
WHEN I WASTE THOUSANDS
OF HIS DOLLARS!

05:45.386 --> 05:47.136
LOOK, I JUST NEED A COUPLE OF
DAYS TO FIGURE THINGS OUT.

05:47.137 --> 05:50.309
- YOU GOTTA HELP ME.
- WHAT, YOU WANT ME TO HIDE YOU IN MY ROOM?

05:50.310 --> 05:51.811
WHAT? ( laughing )

05:51.812 --> 05:55.064
HIDE ME IN YOUR BEDROOM? NO,
THAT WOULD BE RIDICULOUS.

05:55.065 --> 05:56.477
YOU HAVE A BASEMENT,
THOUGH, RIGHT?

05:59.149 --> 06:00.480
( door opens )

06:00.481 --> 06:02.071
OH, JOE, THERE YOU ARE.

06:02.072 --> 06:05.074
I WAS THINKING ABOUT OUR
FRIDAY NIGHT DINNER.

06:05.075 --> 06:07.487
I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE NATE
AND GILLIAN TO VITELLO'S.

06:07.488 --> 06:09.659
YEAH, OR MAYBE NOT.

06:09.660 --> 06:11.330
ARE YOU KIDDING?
GILLIAN LOVES ITALIAN,

06:11.331 --> 06:13.253
AND SHE SAID NATE IS ALWAYS
UP FOR TRYING SOMETHING NEW.

06:15.956 --> 06:18.458
SO I HEAR.

06:18.459 --> 06:22.051
I HAVE THIS LITTLE FANTASY
WHERE SOME DAY WE'LL TRAVEL

06:22.052 --> 06:23.673
WITH NATE AND GILLIAN TO ITALY.

06:23.674 --> 06:27.386
WE CAN BOAT AROUND LAKE COMO,
RIDE THE GONDOLAS IN VENICE,

06:27.387 --> 06:29.009
SEE THE FROZEN LAVA
PEOPLE IN POMPEII.

06:31.602 --> 06:33.062
TOO SOON?

06:33.063 --> 06:36.105
HONEY, I DON'T REALLY LIKE TO
PLAN THAT FAR IN THE FUTURE.

06:36.106 --> 06:37.937
I SORTA JUST LIKE TO
LIVE IN THE MOMENT.

06:37.938 --> 06:39.609
( chuckles ) YOU SEE THAT?

06:39.610 --> 06:42.111
THAT WAS A BEAUTIFUL
MOMENT RIGHT THERE.

06:42.112 --> 06:43.443
OOH OOH OOH OOH!

06:43.444 --> 06:45.575
THERE WAS ANOTHER ONE.

06:45.576 --> 06:46.786
WHY ARE YOU SUDDENLY SO NEGATIVE

06:46.787 --> 06:48.077
ABOUT OUR FRIENDSHIP
WITH NATE AND GILLIAN?

06:48.078 --> 06:49.869
I'M NOT BEING NEGATIVE.
IT'S JUST THE FUTURE IS...

06:49.870 --> 06:52.031
IT'S IN THE FUTURE. YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE.

06:52.032 --> 06:54.034
ASK THOSE FROZEN LAVA PEOPLE.

06:55.085 --> 06:56.876
HEY, YOU KNOW SOMETHING.

06:56.877 --> 06:59.039
PUT DOWN YOUR BALLS AND
LOOK ME IN THE EYE.

07:00.631 --> 07:02.502
NATE SAID SOMETHING. TELL
ME WHAT HE TOLD YOU.

07:02.503 --> 07:04.093
COME ON, TELL ME...

07:04.094 --> 07:06.305
- HEY!
- ...OR THE REST OF THEM GET IT.

07:06.306 --> 07:08.097
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, NATE
DID TELL ME SOMETHING,

07:08.098 --> 07:10.309
- BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT NATE TOLD ME.
- JOE, WE'RE A COUPLE.

07:10.310 --> 07:11.761
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO TELL
EACH OTHER EVERYTHING.

07:11.762 --> 07:13.102
HONEY, HE TOLD ME IN CONFIDENCE!

07:13.103 --> 07:15.606
COME ON, YOU KNOW THE SAYING.
BROS BEFORE H...

07:17.057 --> 07:19.108
THE LADIES.

07:19.109 --> 07:21.731
- JOE.
- I MADE A NATE A PROMISE!

07:21.732 --> 07:23.062
YOU CAN ALWAYS TELL
YOUR PARTNER SOMETHING

07:23.063 --> 07:24.113
THAT HAS BEEN TOLD TO
YOU IN CONFIDENCE.

07:24.114 --> 07:26.946
IT'S... IT'S THE COUPLES' CODE.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.278
- YOU JUST MADE THAT UP.
- NO, IT'S A REAL THING!

07:29.279 --> 07:32.071
ONE HEART, ONE MIND. THAT'S WHY
BOYFRIENDS AND GIRLFRIENDS

07:32.072 --> 07:34.074
CAN'T BE MADE TO TESTIFY
AGAINST EACH OTHER.

07:35.035 --> 07:37.076
YEAH, THEY CAN.

07:37.077 --> 07:38.998
WHAT, ARE YOU A LAWYER NOW?

07:38.999 --> 07:40.290
- HEY!
- TELL ME!

07:43.213 --> 07:45.215
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

07:46.386 --> 07:47.757
NATE'S GONNA LEAVE GILLIAN.

07:47.758 --> 07:49.799
SHUT THE FRONT DOOR.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.050
HE HASN'T TOLD HER YET.

07:51.051 --> 07:53.302
OH NO, GILLIAN'S
GONNA BE DEVASTATED.

07:53.303 --> 07:57.186
I KNOW. HEY, YOU CANNOT BREATHE A
WORD OF THIS TO GILLIAN, ALL RIGHT?

07:57.187 --> 07:59.729
I TOLD YOU UNDER THE COUPLES' CODE.
YOU GOTTA KEEP IT A SECRET.

07:59.730 --> 08:02.312
- BUT...
- AH, BUP BUP! IT'S A REAL THING.

08:03.694 --> 08:05.154
DAMN, IT IS.

08:05.155 --> 08:07.277
WILL YOU STOP
SQUASHING MY BALLS?!

08:12.743 --> 08:15.615
SO I'M GONNA GET A
WHOLE NEW BEDROOM SET,

08:15.616 --> 08:16.826
NOT JUST THE HEADBOARD.

08:16.827 --> 08:18.878
IT'S EXPENSIVE, BUT
NATE'S WORTH IT.

08:18.879 --> 08:19.999
MM-HMM, MM-HMM.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.921
'CAUSE IF I SPLURGE
ON A NEW MATTRESS,

08:21.922 --> 08:23.883
I MIGHT AS WELL TURN
THE WHOLE BEDROOM

08:23.884 --> 08:26.505
INTO THE PERFECT LITTLE LOVE
NEST FOR ME AND NATE, RIGHT?

08:26.506 --> 08:28.718
MM-HMM. ( chuckles )

08:28.719 --> 08:31.470
GEE, MEL, YOU'VE HARDLY SAID
A WORD THIS WHOLE TIME.

08:31.471 --> 08:33.723
OH, IT'S JUST SUCH
DAMN GOOD COFFEE.

08:33.724 --> 08:35.434
AND I JUST CAN'T
GET ENOUGH OF IT.

08:35.435 --> 08:37.767
- MMM MMM.
- OH, I FORGOT.

08:37.768 --> 08:40.980
LAST NIGHT I TOLD NATE WHAT I WAS
GIVING HIM FOR HIS BIRTHDAY...

08:40.981 --> 08:43.813
A WEEK AT N.B.A. FANTASY
BASKETBALL CAMP.

08:43.814 --> 08:46.235
HE WAS SO EXCITED.

08:46.236 --> 08:48.197
IT WAS LIKE THE BIGGEST
SURPRISE EVER.

08:48.198 --> 08:51.530
MAYBE NOT THE BIGGEST.

08:51.531 --> 08:52.952
WELL, I HAD TO TELL HIM EARLY.

08:52.953 --> 08:54.413
- I JUST CAN'T KEEP A SECRET.
- MMM.

08:54.414 --> 08:57.787
IT IS HARD FOR GOOD
PEOPLE TO KEEP A SECRET.

08:57.788 --> 08:59.789
YOU KNOW, GOOD,
WELL-MEANING PEOPLE.

08:59.790 --> 09:02.211
AND NATE, HE'S... HE'S
SUCH A WONDERFUL HUSBAND.

09:02.212 --> 09:04.043
- ( gulps )
- YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT HE DOES?

09:04.044 --> 09:06.255
AT ANY TIME OF DAY OR NIGHT,

09:06.256 --> 09:07.877
IF I WANT A CAPPUCCINO,

09:07.878 --> 09:10.970
HE WILL RUN DOWN TO THE
STARBUCKS AND GET IT FOR ME.

09:10.971 --> 09:13.934
I AM SO LUCKY TO HAVE HIM.

09:15.596 --> 09:16.887
NATE'S LEAVING YOU.

09:19.680 --> 09:25.025
BUY HEY, THE GOOD NEWS IS HOME CAPPUCCINO
MAKERS HAVE REALLY COME DOWN IN PRICE.

09:30.741 --> 09:32.862
GILLIAN, SWEETIE, OKAY.

09:32.863 --> 09:34.744
ARE YOU PULLING
INTO YOUR DRIVEWAY?

09:34.745 --> 09:38.537
GOOD. NOW LET ME HEAR YOU TURN OFF
THE CAR BEFORE YOU CLOSE THE GARAGE.

09:38.538 --> 09:41.961
OH, THAT'S MY WILL-TO-LIVE GIRL.

09:41.962 --> 09:44.163
OKAY, YOU CALL ME IF
YOU NEED ANYTHING...

09:44.164 --> 09:47.546
'CAUSE I SURE NEED SOMETHING.

09:47.547 --> 09:50.840
HEY, LENNOX, LET ME ASK YOU
A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION.

09:50.841 --> 09:53.172
IF YOU KNEW YOUR FRIEND WAS GONNA
BE DUMPED, YOU'D TELL HER, RIGHT?

09:53.173 --> 09:56.135
OH MY GOD, YES. I COULDN'T
LIVE WITH MYSELF,

09:56.136 --> 09:57.807
WALKING AROUND WITH THAT
KIND OF INFORMATION.

09:57.808 --> 09:59.558
EVEN IF YOU PROMISED
SOMEONE YOU WOULDN'T TELL?

09:59.559 --> 10:01.480
EVEN IF. YOU HAVE TO!

10:01.481 --> 10:03.182
SISTERS GOTTA HAVE
EACH OTHER'S BACKS.

10:03.183 --> 10:05.935
RIGHT? SO IF I KNOW SOMETHING,
IT'S MY SISTERLY DUTY TO TELL.

10:05.936 --> 10:08.397
I HAVE TO PASS THAT
INFORMATION ALONG.

10:08.398 --> 10:09.899
IT IS THE SACRED
BOND OF SISTERHOOD.

10:09.900 --> 10:13.362
EXACTLY. SO WHO IS IT?
WHAT HAPPENED?

10:13.363 --> 10:15.615
OH, GIRL, I CAN'T TELL YOU.

10:18.328 --> 10:21.080
- NICE.
- MAN, YOU REALLY KNOW YOUR STUFF, JOE.

10:21.081 --> 10:22.832
MY STAMINA IS WAY UP.

10:22.833 --> 10:24.874
I SWEAR I'VE TAKEN OFF
LIKE FIVE POUNDS.

10:24.875 --> 10:26.295
GOOD GOOD.

10:26.296 --> 10:28.708
HEY, SPEAKING OF TAKING OFF,

10:28.709 --> 10:31.170
HOW'S EVERYTHING GOING
ON THE HOME FRONT?

10:31.171 --> 10:34.714
I'M ASSUMING THAT YOU'RE STILL
AT HOME AND MARRIED AND ALL.

10:34.715 --> 10:37.717
OH, THAT? YOU CAN
RELAX, BREAK-UP'S OFF.

10:37.718 --> 10:39.889
REALLY? DUDE, THAT'S GREAT!

10:39.890 --> 10:42.641
HEY, UP HIGH FOR NOT
LEAVING YOUR WIFE!

10:42.642 --> 10:45.144
- ( both laugh )
- WHAT MADE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND?

10:45.145 --> 10:47.937
LAST NIGHT, GILLIAN TOLD ME THE
BIRTHDAY PRESENT SHE'S GETTING ME...

10:47.938 --> 10:51.110
FANTASY BASKETBALL CAMP.
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

10:51.111 --> 10:54.824
WHAT DO YOU KNOW, HUH? ANOTHER
MARRIAGE SAVED BY THE N.B.A.

10:54.825 --> 10:56.575
GILLIAN KNOWS ME SO WELL.

10:56.576 --> 10:58.327
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I WAS THINKING.

10:58.328 --> 11:00.990
SHE'S MY SOUL MATE. I GUESS WE WERE
JUST GOING THROUGH A LITTLE FUNK.

11:00.991 --> 11:02.872
SO GLAD THAT SHE
WILL NEVER FIND OUT

11:02.873 --> 11:04.663
ABOUT THE LITTLE BOMB
THAT ALMOST WENT OFF.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.245
SO GLAD YOU'RE THE
ONLY PERSON I TOLD.

11:06.246 --> 11:08.918
( scoffs ) YEAH, AND
WHO WOULD I TELL?

11:08.919 --> 11:10.711
( chuckles ) NO ONE.
THAT'S THE ANSWER.

11:13.794 --> 11:16.926
And then Cassandra has to
confront her English teacher,

11:16.927 --> 11:19.468
the hydra!

11:19.469 --> 11:22.762
IT'S REALLY HARD TO SEE.
YOU'RE PIXELATING LIKE CRAZY.

11:22.763 --> 11:26.806
WHERE ARE YOU CALLING ME FROM,
AN UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE?

11:26.807 --> 11:29.729
No. Why would I be calling
you from anywhere

11:29.730 --> 11:32.231
- OTHER THAN MY DORM ROOM HERE IN GOOD OLD VERMONT?
- ( door opens )

11:32.232 --> 11:33.733
IT LOOKS DIFFERENT.

11:33.734 --> 11:35.945
- NO, IT DOESN'T.
- HERE, BRO.

11:35.946 --> 11:37.947
- SHH SHH!
- WHO'S THAT?

11:37.948 --> 11:40.529
Nobody. Oh, him.

11:40.530 --> 11:42.621
( laughs ) It's... it's
my new roommate...

11:42.622 --> 11:45.414
- Sanjay.
- THAT'S FUNNY.

11:45.415 --> 11:48.918
SANJAY IS ACTUALLY WEARING THE SAME
SHIRT THAT RYDER IS WEARING TODAY.

11:48.919 --> 11:51.961
I don't think it's funny at all.
It's a very popular T-shirt.

11:51.962 --> 11:55.094
Sanjay, you can leave
now, 'cause I'm working

11:55.095 --> 11:58.968
with my friend Lennox here who
is very far away in Toledo.

11:58.969 --> 12:00.840
( Indian accent ) Oh yes,
the pretty blonde girl.

12:00.841 --> 12:02.341
She's quite the hottie.

12:02.342 --> 12:04.764
What I wouldn't do to get with
an American girl like her.

12:04.765 --> 12:07.346
WHAT PART OF INDIA IS HE FROM?

12:07.347 --> 12:09.019
THE IRISH QUARTER.

12:10.650 --> 12:12.481
- LET'S GET BACK TO THE WORK.
- ( door closes )

12:12.482 --> 12:15.564
Well, as usual, your
drawings look great.

12:15.565 --> 12:17.026
I just have to catch
up with the stories.

12:17.027 --> 12:18.657
I've been so crazy busy.

12:18.658 --> 12:22.621
Oh, with what? German
expressionist film class or...

12:22.622 --> 12:24.824
extracurriculars?

12:24.825 --> 12:27.706
Zander, would you stop giving me
such a hard time about Emerson?

12:27.707 --> 12:30.129
Okay, you and I have
separate lives now.

12:30.130 --> 12:32.792
There are hundreds and
hundreds of miles between us

12:32.793 --> 12:34.373
and that should make
it easier for you

12:34.374 --> 12:36.926
to leave my private life alone.

12:36.927 --> 12:40.009
Yup. Hundreds and
hundreds of miles.

12:40.010 --> 12:42.882
- HERE YOU GO.
- OH, RYDER, YOU WON'T BELIEVE THIS.

12:42.883 --> 12:44.884
ZANDER'S ROOMMATE HAS THE
SAME T-SHIRT YOU HAVE.

12:44.885 --> 12:48.347
I DON'T BELIEVE IT. ZANDER,
PUT YOUR ROOMMATE ON CAMERA.

12:48.348 --> 12:49.688
He left, okay?

12:49.689 --> 12:51.811
He's captain of the dork squad

12:51.812 --> 12:53.983
and he's got a big
meet coming up.

12:53.984 --> 12:56.445
Oh my gosh. Wait. What?
Look at that.

12:56.446 --> 12:58.988
- We both ordered from Taco Burger.
- ( chuckles )

12:58.989 --> 13:01.200
- What are the odds?
- Wow.

13:01.201 --> 13:04.113
HIGH, OBVIOUSLY.
OBVIOUSLY VERY HIGH.

13:04.114 --> 13:07.286
CAN WE JUST CUT THE CHIT-CHAT
AND GET BACK TO WORK PLEASE?

13:07.287 --> 13:09.708
- THANK YOU.
- Hey yo, when your roommate gets back,

13:09.709 --> 13:11.911
we should all video
chat together.

13:11.912 --> 13:13.582
No, thanks.

13:13.583 --> 13:15.464
He doesn't really
like being on camera

13:15.465 --> 13:17.086
ever since his face
got all messed up

13:17.087 --> 13:19.549
after he kept messing
with his friend.

13:20.760 --> 13:22.091
- ( door opens )
- Joe: HEY, MEL!

13:22.092 --> 13:24.553
GREAT NEWS, ALL RIGHT?

13:24.554 --> 13:26.015
NATE IS NOT LEAVING GILLIAN.

13:26.016 --> 13:28.978
THEY'RE STAYING TOGETHER, SO
THE LOVE BOAT IS SAILING ON.

13:28.979 --> 13:31.190
THAT'S AMAZING NEWS!
THAT'S FANTASTIC!

13:31.191 --> 13:33.773
- MM-HMM.
- OH CRAP.

13:35.435 --> 13:36.897
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "OH CRAP"?

13:38.068 --> 13:40.780
DID YOU TELL GILLIAN THAT
NATE WAS GONNA LEAVE HER?

13:41.862 --> 13:43.323
WELL...

13:49.079 --> 13:50.910
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU
SPILLED THE BEANS

13:50.911 --> 13:52.711
TO GILLIAN ABOUT NATE
WANTING TO DUMP HER!

13:52.712 --> 13:54.663
YOU GAVE ME THE BEANS.
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?

13:54.664 --> 13:57.046
I DON'T KNOW! CLENCH
LIKE A DRUG MULE

13:57.047 --> 13:58.878
ON A PLANE FROM COLUMBIA!

13:58.879 --> 14:01.921
- WHAT HAPPENED TO THE COUPLES' CODE?
- HEY, THE COUPLES' CODE

14:01.922 --> 14:03.722
IS SUPERSEDED BY THE
BOND OF SISTERHOOD.

14:03.723 --> 14:06.805
ASK LENNOX. WOMEN ARE FOREVER.
MEN COME AND GO.

14:06.806 --> 14:08.427
YEAH. YEAH, I'M SURE
THEY COME AND GO

14:08.428 --> 14:09.848
WHEN YOU CAN'T CONTROL WHAT'S
COMING OUT OF YOUR MOUTH!

14:09.849 --> 14:12.101
MY MOUTH? I'M NOT THE ONLY
ONE WITH A MOUTH HERE.

14:12.102 --> 14:13.812
WHO BROKE THE
CONFIDENCE FIRST, JOE?

14:13.813 --> 14:15.895
ARE YOU K... YOU
MADE ME TELL YOU!

14:15.896 --> 14:17.526
AND I TOLD YOU IN CONFIDENCE.

14:17.527 --> 14:18.777
SO ACTUALLY, YOU
BROKE MY CONFIDENCE!

14:18.778 --> 14:20.359
WELL, YOU BROKE THE
CONFIDENCE FIRST.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.901
I WAS JUST PASSING ALONG THE
CONFIDENCE YOU ALREADY BROKE,

14:21.902 --> 14:24.484
SO IN A SENSE, YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT TOLD GILLIAN, NOT ME.

14:26.576 --> 14:28.117
YOU EVER LISTEN TO YOURSELF?

14:28.118 --> 14:29.788
OKAY, FINE. I WAS JUST GRASPING.

14:29.789 --> 14:32.661
THIS IS BAD, JOE. YOU KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW?

14:32.662 --> 14:34.543
GILLIAN WENT HOME,
CONFRONTED NATE,

14:34.544 --> 14:36.545
THERE'S YELLING. SHE TOSSED ALL
HIS STUFF OUT ON THE LAWN.

14:36.546 --> 14:38.587
BUSTER IS PROBABLY
PEEING EVERYWHERE.

14:38.588 --> 14:40.419
OH, THAT POOR LITTLE GUY.

14:40.420 --> 14:44.173
YOU KNOW, IN A BREAK-UP, IT'S
ALWAYS THE DOG WHO PAYS THE PRICE.

14:44.174 --> 14:46.555
- ( cellphone rings )
- OH.

14:46.556 --> 14:49.598
AH! IT'S A TEXT FROM GILLIAN!
I CAN'T READ IT. YOU READ IT.

14:49.599 --> 14:50.809
- ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY, I'LL READ IT. NO, YOU!

14:50.810 --> 14:52.641
WAIT, NO! OKAY, DAMN
IT, I'LL DO IT.

14:52.642 --> 14:56.185
"FOR OUR DINNER, HOW ABOUT THAT SUSHI
PLACE YOU'VE BEEN WANTING TO TRY?

14:56.186 --> 14:58.227
SEE YOU GUYS FRIDAY AT 8:00."

14:58.228 --> 14:59.688
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

14:59.689 --> 15:01.481
LET ME SEE THAT.

15:02.612 --> 15:04.984
APPARENTLY THE
DINNER IS STILL ON.

15:04.985 --> 15:07.696
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? I MEAN DOES
THAT MEAN SHE TALKED TO HIM,

15:07.697 --> 15:09.618
- SHE DIDN'T TALK TO HIM?
- NO NO NO, SHE HAD TO HAVE TALKED TO HIM.

15:09.619 --> 15:11.830
YOU DON'T HEAR SOMETHING
LIKE THAT AND SAY NOTHING.

15:11.831 --> 15:14.413
MAYBE SHE DIDN'T.
MAYBE SHE DECIDED

15:14.414 --> 15:17.336
TO HOLD ON TO IT AND USE IT LATER
WHEN SHE'S REALLY TICKED OFF.

15:17.337 --> 15:18.707
WHO WOULD DO THAT?

15:18.708 --> 15:21.541
NOBODY.

15:24.304 --> 15:26.346
( switch clicks )

15:28.718 --> 15:31.720
( Lennox sighs ) SEE? I TOLD
YOU THIS IS THE PERFECT PLACE.

15:31.721 --> 15:33.262
WE DON'T HAVE TO DEAL
WITH YOUR ROOMMATES

15:33.263 --> 15:35.264
AND THEIR BEER PONG TOURNAMENTS
AND MY LITTLE BROTHER

15:35.265 --> 15:36.855
( mutters ) BEING IN THE
ROOM RIGHT NEXT DOOR.

15:36.856 --> 15:39.478
I LIKE IT. PRIVATE AND QUIET...

15:39.479 --> 15:41.480
AND SMELLING A
LITTLE LIKE TACOS.

15:41.481 --> 15:43.693
OH, EMERSON, YOU AND
YOUR SWEET TALK.

15:50.030 --> 15:52.491
( clatters )

15:52.492 --> 15:54.493
ZANDER?!

15:54.494 --> 15:56.246
LENNOX SCANLON.

15:57.957 --> 16:01.290
WHAT... WHAT A SURPRISE
TO SEE YOU HERE.

16:01.291 --> 16:04.343
YEAH, I KNOW. WHY WOULD
I BE IN MY OWN HOUSE?!

16:04.344 --> 16:07.847
YOU MUST BE EMERSON. NICE TO
FINALLY MEET YOU IN PERSON.

16:10.140 --> 16:12.551
YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND LIVES
UNDER YOUR HOUSE?

16:12.552 --> 16:14.683
LIKE A RACCOON?

16:14.684 --> 16:17.556
YEAH, ZANDER, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING IN MY BASEMENT?

16:17.557 --> 16:18.898
AT THE MOMENT, MY WHITES.

16:20.060 --> 16:21.650
OKAY. EMERSON, SWEETIE,

16:21.651 --> 16:24.563
COULD YOU JUST GIVE US A
MINUTE WHILE I HANDLE THIS?

16:24.564 --> 16:26.775
WHATEVER YOU NEED.

16:26.776 --> 16:27.777
WOW.

16:28.948 --> 16:30.110
( scoffs ) RUDE.

16:32.872 --> 16:35.704
- OKAY, ZANDER, THIS IS BIG-TIME CRAZY.
- ( door closes )

16:35.705 --> 16:38.247
OKAY, COMING BACK HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU, OKAY?

16:38.248 --> 16:40.579
I JUST... I GOT BOOTED OUT OF
SCHOOL FOR MISSING MY EXAMS,

16:40.580 --> 16:43.082
AND IF MY DAD FINDS OUT,
HE WILL LITERALLY KILL ME.

16:43.083 --> 16:44.673
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TELL HIM EVENTUALLY.

16:44.674 --> 16:47.426
- YOU CAN'T HIDE HERE FOREVER.
- ( scoffs ) NOT FOREVER.

16:47.427 --> 16:48.968
LIKE FOUR MORE YEARS.

16:50.550 --> 16:51.890
OH, COME ON, ZANDER.

16:51.891 --> 16:53.682
LOOK, YOUR PARENTS NEED TO KNOW.

16:53.683 --> 16:57.056
AND MAYBE YOU CAN FIGURE SOMETHING
OUT AND BY NEXT SEMESTER

16:57.057 --> 16:59.598
YOU CAN START FRESH.

16:59.599 --> 17:01.520
- YOU REALLY THINK SO?
- IT'S WORTH A SHOT.

17:01.521 --> 17:02.902
- OH, THANKS, LEN.
- MM-HMM.

17:04.354 --> 17:05.854
OH, I HAVE THOSE SAME BOXERS.

17:05.855 --> 17:07.486
WAIT, ARE YOU WEARING MY BOXERS?

17:07.487 --> 17:10.649
RYDER DID THE LAUNDRY AND
HE GOT EVERYTHING MIXED UP.

17:10.650 --> 17:12.701
- I'LL JUST GIVE 'EM BACK.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:12.702 --> 17:13.913
KEEP 'EM.

17:18.078 --> 17:20.659
( Japanese music playing )

17:20.660 --> 17:22.831
( men shout )

17:22.832 --> 17:25.003
HOW YOU DOING? LONGO,
PARTY OF FOUR.

17:25.004 --> 17:26.255
WE'RE ACTUALLY MEETING
ANOTHER COUPLE HERE.

17:26.256 --> 17:28.507
AH. YES, THEY WERE ALREADY HERE

17:28.508 --> 17:31.470
- AND THEY LEFT YOU A NOTE.
- OH, CAN I SEE THAT?

17:31.471 --> 17:34.012
THEY TIPPED ME RATHER
WELL TO READ IT,

17:34.013 --> 17:37.137
SO COULD YOU JUST
LET ME DO MY SPIEL?

17:38.388 --> 17:41.019
"DEAR MEL AND JOE,
NO THANKS TO YOU,

17:41.020 --> 17:43.272
WE WERE ABLE TO WORK
OUT OUR DIFFERENCES.

17:43.273 --> 17:45.063
WE THOUGHT WE COULD TRUST YOU,

17:45.064 --> 17:48.687
BUT CLEARLY YOU'RE NOT THE TYPE
OF PEOPLE WHO CAN KEEP SECRETS."

17:48.688 --> 17:50.028
OKAY, WELL, THAT'S AN
UNFAIR ACCUSATION.

17:50.029 --> 17:52.571
ABSOLUTELY. I MEAN, WE HAD
THE BEST OF INTENTIONS.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.783
EXCUSE ME. I AM NOT FINISHED.

17:54.784 --> 17:57.287
YOU MADE ME LOSE MY PLACE.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.289
"BUT CLEARLY YOU'RE NOT
THE TYPE OF PEOPLE

18:00.290 --> 18:03.702
WHO CAN KEEP SECRETS.
OR ARE YOU?

18:03.703 --> 18:07.045
HERE ARE TWO SEALED ENVELOPES.

18:07.046 --> 18:09.468
IN THE BLUE ENVELOPE IS A SECRET

18:09.469 --> 18:11.670
THAT JOE SHARED WITH
NATE ABOUT MEL.

18:11.671 --> 18:15.714
IN THE PINK ENVELOPE IS A SECRET THAT
MEL SHARED WITH GILLIAN ABOUT JOE.

18:15.715 --> 18:17.636
WE KEPT THE SECRETS.

18:17.637 --> 18:20.929
THE QUESTION IS, WILL YOU?"

18:20.930 --> 18:22.721
ENJOY YOUR MEAL.

18:22.722 --> 18:25.684
OKAY, WELL, THAT'S AN
OBVIOUS MANIPULATION.

18:25.685 --> 18:27.276
THEY'RE CLEARLY JUST
TRYING TO GET US TO FIGHT.

18:27.277 --> 18:28.857
YEAH, THEY'RE JUST TRYING
TO GET IN OUR HEADS.

18:28.858 --> 18:30.489
- NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
- MM-MM.

18:30.490 --> 18:32.652
SO WHAT EXACTLY DID
YOU TELL NATE?

18:33.823 --> 18:36.325
I DON'T KNOW, HONEY. I
TOLD HIM SOME STUFF.

18:36.326 --> 18:38.867
WHAT, THERE'S JUST SO MUCH
THAT YOU CAN'T NARROW IT DOWN?

18:38.868 --> 18:40.699
NO. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE
IN A RELATIONSHIP,

18:40.700 --> 18:42.291
- YOU VENT SOMETIMES.
- THAT'S TRUE. THAT'S TRUE.

18:42.292 --> 18:44.663
VENTING IS HEALTHY. IF MEN
AND WOMEN TOLD EACH OTHER

18:44.664 --> 18:46.505
EVERY THOUGHT THEY HAD,

18:46.506 --> 18:49.548
THE HUMAN RACE WOULD DIE OFF
IN ABOUT AND HOUR AND A HALF.

18:49.549 --> 18:52.301
LOOK, WE HAVE TO BE TOTALLY OPEN
AND HONEST WITH EACH OTHER.

18:52.302 --> 18:55.053
BUT HOW DO WE KNOW WHAT TO
TELL AND WHAT NOT TO TELL?

18:55.054 --> 18:56.845
THIS GOES BEYOND
THE COUPLES' CODE.

18:56.846 --> 18:58.717
WE NEED, LIKE. A
MEL AND JOE CODE.

18:58.718 --> 19:00.849
I LIKE THAT. ALL RIGHT.
LET'S DO IT.

19:00.850 --> 19:02.471
ALWAYS TELL EACH
OTHER EVERYTHING...

19:02.472 --> 19:04.643
( inhales sharply )
EXCEPT WHEN WE SHOULDN'T.

19:04.644 --> 19:07.105
- OKAY, WE'LL KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BY...?
- TRIAL AND ERROR.

19:07.106 --> 19:09.528
MOSTLY BY ERROR I SUSPECT.

19:09.529 --> 19:11.730
SO... ( sighs ) WHAT
DO WE DO WITH THESE?

19:11.731 --> 19:13.692
THESE? HONEY, THESE
ARE TOXIC MATERIAL.

19:13.693 --> 19:15.774
I SAY WE HAVE TO DESTROY
THESE THINGS IMMEDIATELY.

19:15.775 --> 19:17.616
ABSOLUTELY... AFTER
WE READ THEM.

19:17.617 --> 19:19.408
HONEY. REALLY.

19:19.409 --> 19:22.041
OKAY? THERE WE GO. THERE WE GO.

19:23.833 --> 19:25.705
BYE-BYE. ( chuckles )

19:26.746 --> 19:28.377
DON'T YOU FEEL BETTER?

19:28.378 --> 19:30.379
YEAH, SO MUCH LIGHTER.
( laughs )

19:30.380 --> 19:32.251
YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS EVENING
NEEDS A FRESH START.

19:32.252 --> 19:35.003
- I'M GONNA GO ASK FOR A NEW TABLE.
- OKAY.

19:35.004 --> 19:36.885
OKAY, WHAT THE HELL
DID HE SAY ABOUT ME?

19:36.886 --> 19:40.259
LET'S SEE. "BIG."

19:40.260 --> 19:42.010
BIG... BIG... BIG WHAT?

19:42.011 --> 19:43.061
- MEL.
- YEAH?

19:43.062 --> 19:44.102
WE'RE HEADING OVER
TO THE SUSHI BAR.

19:44.103 --> 19:45.564
OKAY.

19:45.565 --> 19:47.936
HEY, YOU KNOW, LISTEN, ACCORDING
TO THE MEL AND JOE CODE,

19:47.937 --> 19:49.228
THERE IS SOMETHING I
HAVE TO TELL YOU.

19:49.229 --> 19:50.729
WHAT?

19:50.730 --> 19:53.362
NO MATTER WHAT IT SAID
IN THOSE ENVELOPES...

19:53.363 --> 19:57.526
- I LOVE YOU.
- AWW, I LOVE YOU TOO.

19:57.527 --> 19:58.947
HEY, JOE, TELL ME...

19:58.948 --> 20:00.949
WHAT'S "BIG"?

20:00.950 --> 20:02.701
- YOU LOOKED?
- YEAH, I COULDN'T HELP MYSELF.

20:02.702 --> 20:05.033
SO WHAT'S BIG?

20:05.034 --> 20:08.587
- LET IT GO, MEL.
- BIG HAIR, BIG SMILE?

20:08.588 --> 20:11.129
- BIG... BIG... BIG TIPPER?
- I'M NOT... I'M NOT PLAYING THAT GAME, HONEY.

20:11.130 --> 20:12.631
I KNOW, IT'S BIG
BRAIN, ISN'T IT?

20:12.632 --> 20:15.715
YES, YES, IT IS. YOU GUESSED IT.
IT'S BIG BRAIN.

20:17.677 --> 20:19.217
- LENNOX.
- ( screams )

20:19.218 --> 20:21.890
WOULD YOU STOP HIDING OUT
IN PLACES AROUND MY HOUSE?

20:21.891 --> 20:24.182
I'M SORRY. I JUST WANTED TO TELL YOU I
CAME CLEAN TO MY DAD LIKE YOU SAID...

20:24.183 --> 20:26.395
AND I WASHED YOUR BOXERS.

20:26.396 --> 20:29.348
- HERE YOU GO.
- SO, HOW'D YOUR DAD TAKE IT?

20:29.349 --> 20:32.611
AMAZINGLY. YEAH, HE DIDN'T FREAK OUT
AT ALL WHEN I TOLD HIM MY NEW PLAN.

20:32.612 --> 20:34.653
I'M GONNA TAKE SOME CLASSES
AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO.

20:34.654 --> 20:37.566
MY UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO?

20:37.567 --> 20:40.619
TO BE FAIR, IT'S TOLEDO'S
UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO.

20:40.620 --> 20:42.240
SO WHAT CLASSES ARE YOU TAKING?

20:42.241 --> 20:44.783
PSYCHOLOGY, MEDIEVAL
ART HISTORY,

20:44.784 --> 20:47.165
( mumbles ) AND GERMAN
EXPRESSIONIST FILM.

20:47.166 --> 20:50.629
HOLD ON, YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT CLASS.
I'M TAKING THAT CLASS.

20:50.630 --> 20:52.541
IT'S NOT MY FAULT. IT'S NOT
LIKE I DID IT ON PURPOSE.

20:52.542 --> 20:54.082
THERE WASN'T A WHOLE
LOT AVAILABLE.

20:54.083 --> 20:56.295
EVERYTHING ELSE WAS AT 8:00 A.M.

20:56.296 --> 20:57.877
I'M AN ARTIST. LET'S GET REAL.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.839
ALL RIGHT, FINE, BUT REMEMBER,

21:00.840 --> 21:02.511
- I DO HAVE A BOYFRIEND.
- YEAH, I KNOW.

21:02.512 --> 21:04.473
I GET IT. WE'RE NOT
GETTING BACK TOGETHER.

21:04.474 --> 21:06.144
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.
I'M NOT TRYING

21:06.145 --> 21:07.686
TO WORM MY WAY BACK
INTO YOUR LIFE.

21:07.687 --> 21:10.480
- AND I APPRECIATE THAT.
- MMM.

21:14.103 --> 21:15.695
I WILL WIN YOU BACK.

21:17.357 --> 21:18.657
DID YOU SAY SOMETHING?

21:18.658 --> 21:20.739
WHAT? ME? NO. ( mumbles )

21:20.740 --> 21:22.951
- OH. OKAY THEN.
- OKAY.

21:22.952 --> 21:23.703
- BYE.
- BYE.
