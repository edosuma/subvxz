I GOT A LITTLE SOMETHING
I NEED TO DIG UP.

16:00.693 --> 16:03.028
ADD A PINCH
OF LEPRECHAUN DUST.

16:03.028 --> 16:05.531
A PINCH OF
TREE NIP HUSKS.

16:05.531 --> 16:08.801

16:11.036 --> 16:13.639
I'M SORRY.
YOU FAILED THE TEST.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.641
YOUR ANIMAL MAGICAL
GUARDIAN LICENSE

16:15.641 --> 16:17.576
IS REVOKED
FOR ONE YEAR.

16:17.576 --> 16:21.480
GOOD. 'CAUSE YOU'RE
A LOUSY ANIMAL GUARDIAN.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.848
GOOD DAY TO YOU, SIR.

16:22.848 --> 16:23.949

16:23.949 --> 16:26.785
I CAN'T BELIEVE JAKE
DIDN'T HAVE MY BACK

16:26.785 --> 16:30.556
IT'S KIND OF LIKE HOW I
DIDN'T HAVE HIS BACK

16:30.556 --> 16:32.124
WHEN HE NEEDED ME.

16:32.124 --> 16:33.225
YOU KNOW, I BET IF I
LOOK HARD ENOUGH,

16:33.225 --> 16:36.128
THERE'S A LESSON IN HERE
SOMEWHERE.

16:38.564 --> 16:40.532
HEY, FU. HOW'D IT GO?

16:40.532 --> 16:43.535
COME ON. I KNOW IT WAS
SERIOUSLY UNCOOL
I WASN'T THERE.

16:43.535 --> 16:44.903
BUT...FU?

16:44.903 --> 16:46.171
THIS IS THE PART
WHERE I SAY,

16:46.171 --> 16:49.942
LAO CHI'S GRANDSON.
WE MEET AGAIN.

16:49.942 --> 16:50.909
CHANG?

16:50.909 --> 16:52.578
LET GO!

16:55.781 --> 16:59.952
HANDS OFF THE FRIENDSHIP
SWEATER, TROLL DUDE.

17:01.720 --> 17:04.690
TOO BAD I CONVINCED
THE SEWER TROLLS

17:04.690 --> 17:06.090
IT WAS IN THEIR
BEST INTEREST TO JOIN ME.

17:06.090 --> 17:07.626
NOW REVENGE WILL BE MINE.

17:07.626 --> 17:09.627
YOUR GRANDFATHER
TURNED ME IN.

17:09.627 --> 17:12.664
LET'S SEE WHAT I CAN DO
TO HURT HIM LIKE THAT.

17:12.664 --> 17:16.835
OH, YES. SLAY HIS
DRAGON GRANDSON.

17:20.204 --> 17:23.175
WAIT. YOU GUYS ARE ON
HER SIDE NOW?

17:23.175 --> 17:24.209
DON'T YOU GET IT?

17:24.209 --> 17:25.844
CHANG ATTACKED YOU

17:28.180 --> 17:29.281
DUMB AS CUSTARD.

17:29.281 --> 17:31.917

OF THE LITTLE THINGS.

17:31.917 --> 17:34.153
LIKE WORLD DOMINATION

17:34.153 --> 17:36.255
AND SLAYING DRAGONS.

17:36.255 --> 17:39.591
BUT FIRST, LET'S DISPENSE
OF THE EXTRA BAGGAGE.

17:39.591 --> 17:44.129
SOMEHOW I ALWAYS KNEW

17:44.129 --> 17:47.933
THAT'S MY BEST FRIEND
YOU'RE STILETTOING, BABY.

17:47.933 --> 17:49.735

18:37.216 --> 18:40.619
YOU ARE FINISHED
HERE AND NOW.

18:40.619 --> 18:43.188

20:37.502 --> 20:41.006
THIS NEXT BLAST

20:41.406 --> 20:44.009
