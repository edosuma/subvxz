00:01.677 --> 00:03.403
- Not talking to you.
- I'm not talking to you.

00:03.438 --> 00:05.371
You're talking right now to me.

00:05.405 --> 00:08.098
- Well, stop talking!
- I'm trying to do that!

00:08.132 --> 00:09.892
What are you arguing about?

00:09.927 --> 00:11.410
<i>We don't know!</i>

00:11.411 --> 00:13.724
Well, on Serepentis, the only
way to solve an argument

00:13.758 --> 00:16.244
was through
a good game of Thimbles.

00:16.277 --> 00:19.040
- I don't even know what that is.
- Perfect!

00:19.074 --> 00:21.421
Loser leaves the ship
immediately.

00:21.456 --> 00:25.390
- I just said I don't know how to play!
- We got this.

00:25.391 --> 00:28.290
I'm Ventrexia's Thimble
Elite Junior Champion.

00:28.325 --> 00:30.396
Smashers!
All around!

00:30.430 --> 00:33.295
You versus us, winner takes all.

00:33.330 --> 00:35.848
- Queued for play!
- Game go!

00:41.269 --> 00:43.719
- Queue four!
- Thimbles for Clarence!

00:44.858 --> 00:47.309
Oh, you hound!

00:47.344 --> 00:49.622
What in the three rings
of hell is going on?

00:49.656 --> 00:51.658
Gary, it's like you don't even

00:51.693 --> 00:53.419
know how to play Thimbles.

00:53.453 --> 00:54.936
That's what I keep trying
to tell you.

00:54.937 --> 00:56.939
Two to four players equip
themselves with smashers.

00:56.974 --> 00:59.114
Players use said smashers
to gather thimbles.

00:59.149 --> 01:01.012
Thimbles are gathered
by the hitting of thimbles

01:01.047 --> 01:02.323
across the playing field

01:02.324 --> 01:03.704
through the other players'
smashing window.

01:03.705 --> 01:05.914
Thimbles may also be gathered
by other means!

01:05.948 --> 01:08.572
For each limb you remove
from the opposing players

01:08.606 --> 01:09.951
you receive four thimbles

01:09.952 --> 01:11.782
and ownership
of detached limbs.

01:11.816 --> 01:14.509
However, if the other player
fails to clear their limb

01:14.543 --> 01:16.407
in a timely manner
they lose four points,

01:16.442 --> 01:17.683
in addition to losing a limb.

01:17.684 --> 01:20.963
The game is won
by reaching 54 thimbles.

01:20.998 --> 01:23.759
Queued for freakin play.

01:29.179 --> 01:31.042
- Oh!
- Oh-ho-ho, gross!

01:31.077 --> 01:33.010
Eh.
Four thimbles for you.

01:33.044 --> 01:38.049
- Queued for play!
- Hmm. Facticulating.

01:38.084 --> 01:40.190
Ah.
Fact-checkulating.

01:40.224 --> 01:44.815
Ah! Ash, that tattoo ...
is that a dimensional key?

01:46.196 --> 01:47.886
Everyone has one on Serepentis.

01:47.887 --> 01:50.752
So, there's a key on Serepentis.

01:52.098 --> 01:55.653
- I've never seen it.
- That key can help me save Quinn.

01:55.688 --> 01:57.448
Ava. Put up the star map.

01:57.483 --> 02:00.002
<i>Ugh. Now?</i>

02:00.037 --> 02:01.520
Yes, now!

02:11.048 --> 02:14.465

soaked viper waffles.

02:14.500 --> 02:15.707
That's great, H.U.E.

02:15.708 --> 02:18.020

02:26.132 --> 02:29.515
So, none of you are going, 'kay?

02:29.549 --> 02:31.862
Huh. Seems like she really
doesn't want to go.

02:31.896 --> 02:35.072

or is it just H.U.E.?

No. I want the best for you.

Ash, Ash, wake up!

05:37.565 --> 05:39.912
- Did I...?
- Yeah.

05:39.946 --> 05:44.812
- I'm going to Serepentis.
- Are you sure you're ready?

05:44.813 --> 05:47.540
If you go, your mind
has to be clear.

05:47.575 --> 05:50.266
- It is.
- Those walls say otherwise.

05:50.267 --> 05:52.925
It's my call.
I don't need you mothering me.

05:52.959 --> 05:54.685
Hey.
Just looking out, okay?

05:54.720 --> 05:58.448
But I'm sick of being afraid.
And I'm finding my sister!

05:58.482 --> 06:01.520

06:01.554 --> 06:06.559

- Right after you try fixing this Ash hole.

06:20.155 --> 06:22.571
Good luck, Ashy.
I'll hold down the fort.

06:22.605 --> 06:24.746
Hey, do you want
any help on this?

06:24.780 --> 06:26.748

- How do you know where the key is?

06:33.133 --> 06:36.240
I don't.
But my "money compass" does.

06:37.551 --> 06:40.796
Can you stop slinky-ing
your money compass out?

06:40.831 --> 06:42.625
I have three
money compasses.

06:42.660 --> 06:44.178
Does that get confusing?

06:44.179 --> 06:45.736
Very.

06:45.836 --> 06:48.424
- I recommend the snake sandwiches, snake burgers...
- Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.

06:48.459 --> 06:49.943
- ...snake shakes, snake cakes,
- Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm.

06:49.944 --> 06:51.427
- but not snake flakes.
- Mm. Makes sense.

06:51.462 --> 06:54.430

- Oh, really?

06:54.465 --> 06:57.750

- Right. Right.

Ooh, forever balls!

11:42.655 --> 11:45.002
- A combo pack!
- Like the fries! We're the fries.

11:45.037 --> 11:47.349
- Chookity, pok.
- You want to be the dipping sauce?

11:47.384 --> 11:50.283
I've been told I would make
a great dipping sauce.

11:50.318 --> 11:52.803
By whom?
None of your business.

11:52.838 --> 11:56.324
- I'm a onion ring!
- And I can be a napkin! Hooray!

11:56.358 --> 11:57.773
Oh, geez, all right.
Great, okay.

11:57.774 --> 11:59.569
Now it's the combo pack
from hell, but,

11:59.603 --> 12:02.261
okay, Werthrent, are you in
or are you out?

12:02.295 --> 12:03.710
In.

12:03.711 --> 12:06.092
- What's the plan?
- I didn't think that far ahead.

12:06.127 --> 12:07.645
That's not good at all!

12:13.686 --> 12:16.309
Harp! Harp!

12:18.001 --> 12:20.831
- Harp?
- Kill me!

12:20.866 --> 12:23.316
I'm looking at you.
Please kill me!

12:23.351 --> 12:25.215
Oh. Good times.

12:25.249 --> 12:27.769
Who are these putrid wisps
of ectoplasm?

12:27.804 --> 12:30.454
The "Surrendered."

12:31.324 --> 12:35.121
We were told being
offered to Werthrent was beautiful.

12:35.156 --> 12:38.159
That we would go to the Embrace
and live eternity in joy.

12:39.712 --> 12:42.163
Can we all agree that
they stretched the truth, hon?

12:42.197 --> 12:44.648
Yes, not sure this
was worth the wait.

12:44.683 --> 12:48.687
No, I'm sure this was definitely
not worth the wait.

12:54.865 --> 12:56.556
<i>- The key.
- Chookity!</i>

13:05.186 --> 13:08.189
Who dare approaches Septim,

13:08.223 --> 13:10.502
Keeper of the heart of Werthrent?

13:10.536 --> 13:13.746
- Ugh.
- Ash Graven, child of Werthrent.

13:13.781 --> 13:17.543
Rejoice child, for you
have been surrendered.

13:17.578 --> 13:20.339
Who are the unworthy that engulf you?

13:20.373 --> 13:22.375
- Piss off, Bones.
- Yo, Gary Goodspeed.

13:22.410 --> 13:24.274
- Chookity.
- Okay, pipe down!

13:24.308 --> 13:28.105
What brings you
to the innards of darkness?

13:28.140 --> 13:32.075
- Shut up and give us the heart.
- Over my brittle weak bones!

13:32.109 --> 13:36.873
To touch the heart, you must
answer me three riddles.

13:36.907 --> 13:38.702
Riddles?

13:40.152 --> 13:42.706
This is the best thing
you could come up with?

13:42.741 --> 13:46.468
- Harp?
- Riddle #1!

13:46.503 --> 13:48.712
Oh! Oh, geez.
Okay, so no buffer or warm-up.

13:48.747 --> 13:50.333
All right.
We're just going for it.

13:50.334 --> 13:52.716
Okay. Ah!

13:52.751 --> 13:55.201
Ahhhh! Shake it off!
Agh!

13:55.236 --> 13:56.616
Oh, get your game face
going, Gary.

13:56.617 --> 13:58.550
- Okay, okay, I'm ready!
- Yes!

13:58.584 --> 14:02.484
What is blue on the belly,

14:02.519 --> 14:04.486
coated with jelly,

14:04.521 --> 14:07.489
happens to be
quite the smelly jelly,

14:07.524 --> 14:12.460
but often quite smitten
with shelly?

14:12.494 --> 14:15.325
Got it! A cloud.

14:15.359 --> 14:17.465
How the hell did ...
Correct!

14:17.499 --> 14:20.226
- A cloud?!
- Rest assured this next one

14:20.261 --> 14:24.610
will send you hurling
on a roller coaster of the mind.

14:24.645 --> 14:27.717
Hey, how about you
stop bouncing the freakin' ball?

14:27.751 --> 14:30.512
Can't, Gary.
It bounces forever.

14:30.547 --> 14:32.998
- Got it off a dead guy.
- Riddle 2.

14:33.032 --> 14:37.347
Harry had 2 friends,
one of which had 3 friends,

14:37.381 --> 14:39.176
who then had 7 friends,

14:39.211 --> 14:42.177
- who then had 2 friends, who also had...
- Harp?

14:42.212 --> 14:45.813
...10 and 1/2 friends,
who happened to have 12 friends.

14:45.848 --> 14:47.978
What did Harry have for dinner?

14:48.013 --> 14:50.843
I got it.
That would be a conversation?

14:50.878 --> 14:52.673
Son of a ... Correct.

14:52.707 --> 14:54.536
How are you so good at this?

14:54.571 --> 14:57.850
Because I'm a deep space
insanity avoidance companion!

14:57.885 --> 14:59.921
I've been programmed to know
all games, puzzles,

14:59.956 --> 15:02.924
and riddles to keep my best
friend Gary always entertained.

15:02.959 --> 15:05.676
- Right?
- Nothing he has ever done

15:05.707 --> 15:09.551
has ever, at any juncture in time,
entertained me!

15:09.586 --> 15:13.625
This final riddle
will induce brain spasms

15:13.659 --> 15:18.630
from which your frontal cortex
will never recover!

15:18.664 --> 15:21.943
A caramel candy drops in a pool
of grundle handwicks

15:21.978 --> 15:25.395
which wick the hand from
which the wicking has handed.

15:25.429 --> 15:28.053
Did the caramel grow
in hand wicking?

15:28.087 --> 15:34.865
Or, did it get stolen by the
three blind grundle snackers?

15:36.717 --> 15:41.825
Answer correctly or begin
dying 1,000 deaths!

15:41.860 --> 15:44.586
KVN, I know you're gonna
let us down...

15:44.621 --> 15:46.865
in the time that we need
you the most.

15:46.899 --> 15:49.315
No one programmed me
for that total crap

15:49.350 --> 15:52.258
- that dude just made up!
- Called it!

15:52.284 --> 15:54.804
Oh, my bones!

15:54.838 --> 15:57.530
My fragile bones!

15:57.565 --> 15:59.740
Oh, the hurting pains!

15:59.774 --> 16:03.709
My bones are being destroyed.

16:03.744 --> 16:04.951
- Grab the key, yo!
- Oh, help me!

16:04.952 --> 16:08.265
- Harp! Harp!
- Agh, help me, please!

16:08.300 --> 16:12.062
I'll have no more bones
left at this rate.

16:14.030 --> 16:15.582
Gah!

16:22.797 --> 16:24.868
My crushed bones
are being set ablaze!

16:24.903 --> 16:26.767
- How do we get out of here?
- What hell have I arrived to?

16:26.801 --> 16:29.114
- That feels like a question for Richard.
- This is Richard.

16:29.148 --> 16:30.943
Who is that next to you?

16:30.978 --> 16:33.463
<i>- Dan.
- What's Dan doing there?</i>

16:33.497 --> 16:36.293
<i>- Nothing.
- Well, when he stops doing "nothing,"</i>

16:36.328 --> 16:38.192
call me back, okay?

16:40.781 --> 16:42.886
Richard's calling me back
when he's finished with Dan.

16:42.921 --> 16:45.199
Oh, wow. Okay.
There's a minute I'm never getting back.

16:45.233 --> 16:48.210
- Go through the portal!
- Time to go!

16:49.134 --> 16:51.688
- Chookity!
- Ash!

16:54.104 --> 16:57.521
- Gary, take the key!
- Oh, no! Little Cato!

16:58.833 --> 17:00.904
Harp? Is it really you?

17:00.939 --> 17:04.252
Gone. She's gone.
Gone. She's gone.

17:04.287 --> 17:06.151
- Oh, no.
- Ash!

17:06.185 --> 17:09.050
I hate to be that guy,
but it's really time to leave!

17:13.020 --> 17:15.780
- Where's my spider cat? Ash?
- They are not here.

17:15.781 --> 17:18.680
Come on, Little Cato!
Come on!

17:18.714 --> 17:21.683
- Harp, it's me.
- Go!

17:21.718 --> 17:24.444
Don't you remember?
Come back to me.

17:24.444 --> 17:25.858
She's gone. Gone.

17:25.859 --> 17:28.483
- She's gone. Gone.
- I came to save you.

17:28.518 --> 17:30.485
Gone. She's gone.
Gone. Gone.

17:30.520 --> 17:31.934
She's gone.

17:35.214 --> 17:36.559
Ash, I don't know much,

17:36.560 --> 17:38.493
but I know that's
not a person anymore.

17:38.528 --> 17:42.393
- I can't leave her again.
- Go! Go!

17:42.394 --> 17:45.984
Go!

17:54.371 --> 17:56.027
Ow!

18:08.178 --> 18:10.560
Oh! That should cover your rent.

18:10.594 --> 18:11.732
Gimme the key!

18:17.878 --> 18:22.201
Wow! They really do
bounce forever. Hooray!

18:25.715 --> 18:27.415
Hey.

18:28.925 --> 18:32.135
You can't save someone
who doesn't know they're lost.

18:32.170 --> 18:34.551
I thought the whole reason
I got these powers

18:34.586 --> 18:36.207
was to get her back.

18:36.208 --> 18:38.970
Maybe you got them for something
amazing down the line.

18:39.004 --> 18:42.076
You mean something
that hasn't even happened yet?

18:42.111 --> 18:44.734
Yeah.
So great job.

18:44.768 --> 18:46.805
You're gonna be awesome.

18:48.082 --> 18:51.051
- That freaks me out even more.
- How come?

18:51.085 --> 18:54.088
Because it means on
the other side of this,

18:54.123 --> 18:57.609
there might actually
be something good.

18:57.643 --> 19:00.750
Oh. That is terrifying.

19:00.784 --> 19:02.925
No, I-I-I'm there, too.

19:02.959 --> 19:05.617
I think there's a word for that...

19:05.651 --> 19:08.758
- Hope?
- Yeah.

19:08.792 --> 19:11.795
Hope. Pathetic that neither
of us knew that.

19:11.830 --> 19:16.188
- Maybe I'll try it on for size.
- Well, how was it?

19:16.214 --> 19:18.595
It's a little tight
in the crotch, but...

19:18.630 --> 19:20.632
Good.
Want to give it go?

19:20.666 --> 19:25.119
- Maybe after you leave.
- Oh. Okay.

19:25.154 --> 19:27.432
Hey...

19:27.466 --> 19:30.297
Thanks.

19:53.768 --> 19:55.459
Take that! And that!

20:01.362 --> 20:03.330
Eeee.

20:12.339 --> 20:15.756
<i>Attention.
We are directly over the wedding.</i>

20:15.790 --> 20:17.965
Remember, you tried
to hijack our ship

20:18.000 --> 20:20.692
to be with this special, special lady.

20:20.726 --> 20:24.178
So now, you just have
to hijack her heart.

20:24.213 --> 20:26.249
Thanks for the bierstein of wisdom.

20:26.284 --> 20:28.872
Hey, what are best men for?

20:28.907 --> 20:31.461
'Cause I am your best man!

20:31.496 --> 20:33.575
Oh, no! Best friend!

20:33.610 --> 20:35.879
Nooooo!
My best friend!

20:38.710 --> 20:41.092
Aah!

20:41.126 --> 20:42.886
He isn't coming.

20:42.921 --> 20:46.821
Wait! I'm comiiiiiing!

20:46.856 --> 20:48.408
I love you!

20:50.584 --> 20:53.207
Aaaaaah!

20:53.242 --> 20:55.779
- Eugh.
- Rice.

20:55.780 --> 20:58.316
Now the birds will also die.
