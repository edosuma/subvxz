WEBVTT

00:00.100 --> 00:01.669
Previously...

00:01.726 --> 00:03.656
We need to work fast, Salvatore.

00:03.706 --> 00:05.363
Let's make an alliance.

00:05.419 --> 00:06.863
What's in it for me?

00:06.932 --> 00:09.205
You had to man the boat, Gennarino,

00:09.329 --> 00:11.720
and where did you take us?

00:12.028 --> 00:14.202
We'd better go our separate ways.

00:14.743 --> 00:16.719
Your time will come too.

00:17.295 --> 00:19.917
We gotta close the
Monterosa dealing spot.

00:19.966 --> 00:21.471
- But that's mine!
- I know.

00:21.530 --> 00:23.705
We'll find a solution to
open another dealing spot.

00:23.751 --> 00:25.538
I'm not Savastano.

00:26.419 --> 00:28.297
The first head to pop up

00:28.356 --> 00:30.364
gets it chopped off.

00:30.451 --> 00:31.888
What do you want?

00:32.533 --> 00:34.442
Be slaves all your life?

00:34.511 --> 00:36.810
There's a procession
tonight in his mom's town.

00:36.872 --> 00:38.771
That's the right time.

00:43.274 --> 00:44.921
With snakes like you

00:45.898 --> 00:47.816
I gotta cut their heads off.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.074

01:55.509 --> 01:57.010
Looks made for you!

02:05.474 --> 02:07.753
I'll take it.

02:07.817 --> 02:11.379
I knew Patrizia would
find the right one.

02:11.772 --> 02:15.633
Like to try it on in
case it needs altering?

02:15.730 --> 02:19.512
If I'd wanted to strip,
you wouldn't be wearing it...

02:19.582 --> 02:21.270
would you?

02:24.560 --> 02:39.259
Subtitle by RGarciaPR & cavita

02:41.557 --> 02:44.079
I shouldn't ask you
to model her clothes,

02:44.143 --> 02:47.430
but your friend's
mother-in-law's a bitch.

02:56.062 --> 02:57.884
It's for a special occasion?

02:58.923 --> 03:01.050
You're beautiful as it is,

03:01.109 --> 03:03.319
but in this... a panther!

03:04.056 --> 03:06.141
A hyena's better!

03:06.500 --> 03:09.544
Panthers are beautiful,
but don't count a fuck,

03:09.612 --> 03:13.437
but among hyenas,
females rule, understand?

03:15.033 --> 03:16.768
Right!

03:17.149 --> 03:18.924
Please excuse me.

03:19.634 --> 03:23.002
So, tell me how much I owe
you... Scianel's discount!

03:23.079 --> 03:24.602
Always!

03:24.937 --> 03:27.424
- How much?
- 780.

03:31.085 --> 03:32.995
You have to cover me tomorrow.

03:33.062 --> 03:34.739
Why?

03:34.828 --> 03:36.990
After Raffaele, the witch
goes to the Marquis,

03:37.054 --> 03:39.170
it's the only place where
she's not on my back.

03:39.228 --> 03:41.896
You're sure about this, Marinella?

03:41.972 --> 03:45.872
What I do for her and
Lelluccio is never enough.

03:45.949 --> 03:48.509
- This is for the girl.
- Thank you.

03:49.401 --> 03:52.307
Marinella, you done gossipin'?

03:52.379 --> 03:54.441
Let's go, c'mon!

03:54.836 --> 03:57.406
We have to make eggplant
parmesan for Lelluccio, you forgot?

03:57.492 --> 03:59.313
- No.
- Get moving!

04:04.497 --> 04:06.897
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, ma'am!

04:08.110 --> 04:09.811
Bye, Patrizia!

04:11.213 --> 04:13.135
Bye, Marinella.

04:33.579 --> 04:35.569
Your friend's good.

04:35.937 --> 04:38.096
Learn from her.

04:38.942 --> 04:42.691
How can I, Lady Annalisa?
You don't want me to work.

04:44.983 --> 04:47.415
Learn to know your place.

05:20.353 --> 05:22.326
What do you want?

05:22.391 --> 05:24.927
You know, open the dash.

05:41.266 --> 05:42.978
Best regards.

06:17.684 --> 06:20.786
We'll find who did this shit.

06:20.826 --> 06:23.797
Spread the word, I want to know

06:23.858 --> 06:28.036
if he's a nobody or a big shot.

06:28.136 --> 06:30.230
Or one of Conte's, still pissed off.

06:30.355 --> 06:33.031
With Conte dead, it's not
true nobody's in charge.

06:33.143 --> 06:38.057
Some shits are still
sucking Savastano's dick.

06:38.192 --> 06:40.697
Whoever did it, that was my stuff

06:40.807 --> 06:43.863
and I just got spit in the face.

06:44.233 --> 06:47.110
But if he thinks he can piss on me,

06:47.255 --> 06:50.218
he's wrong. Right, Ciro?

06:50.627 --> 06:52.533
Right.

06:53.707 --> 06:58.658
But we make all our decisions together.

06:59.430 --> 07:02.112
Meaning I just gotta be a guard dog?

07:02.800 --> 07:04.425
No.

07:04.867 --> 07:08.834
I mean we gotta stay cool.

07:11.069 --> 07:13.596
Okay, Annalisa?

07:17.961 --> 07:21.278
VILLAGE COPPOLA, BAIA DOMIZIA

08:06.507 --> 08:09.906
- What's up?
- I'm going back to Secondigliano.

08:09.987 --> 08:11.545
It's not the right time.

08:11.620 --> 08:13.356
Conte's dead, it's time.

08:13.425 --> 08:15.750
The water's muddy now,

08:15.860 --> 08:19.160
if I don't move, I can
forget Naples forever.

08:19.223 --> 08:22.103
No fuckin' thing changes
with Conte dead.

08:22.161 --> 08:25.411
We gotta get ready, not
muddle around like amateurs.

08:25.500 --> 08:27.725
There's no gettin' ready.

08:31.836 --> 08:34.804
Those shits are like sewer rats,

08:35.388 --> 08:39.153
I gotta skin 'em in boiling water
before they settle down.

08:39.501 --> 08:41.745
Just wanted you to know.

08:41.811 --> 08:44.240
Now get in the car and go home.

08:47.335 --> 08:50.408
- Secondigliano is my home too.
- No.

08:51.962 --> 08:56.370
It's not your time to come back,
some wounds don't heal.

08:56.725 --> 09:00.375
If you do, they'll all rebel against us.

09:00.784 --> 09:03.623
I want them at each other's throats.

09:10.477 --> 09:12.413
Know what I think, Dad?

09:12.485 --> 09:15.149
What do you think, Gennarino?

09:16.739 --> 09:20.750
Just one of us has those wounds,

09:22.374 --> 09:24.575
and it's you.

09:35.092 --> 09:38.076
- Go, Patrizia.
- See you tomorrow.

10:11.899 --> 10:13.869
Patrizia!

10:14.779 --> 10:16.469
Patri.

10:28.537 --> 10:30.038
Patri.

10:35.224 --> 10:38.096
You already forgot your uncle?

10:40.777 --> 10:42.754
What do you want?

10:42.798 --> 10:44.777
I'll take you home.

10:45.981 --> 10:48.068
C'mon, give me the bags.

11:05.796 --> 11:09.418
- Are you pissed with me?
- Me? No way!

11:13.360 --> 11:16.222
But since my father
died, you disappeared.

11:18.775 --> 11:22.174
- My brother was an asshole.
- My father was a giant.

11:25.163 --> 11:27.546
You haven't changed,

11:27.594 --> 11:30.801
still tough like when you were a kid.

11:31.466 --> 11:34.955
- You need something from me.
- Right.

11:36.923 --> 11:40.352
- You have to do something for me.
- I do nothin' for nobody.

11:40.748 --> 11:42.438
I work for myself.

12:09.715 --> 12:11.602
Thanks for the lift.

12:13.554 --> 12:15.732
See you in eight years.

12:30.360 --> 12:32.024
Patrizia!

12:33.873 --> 12:35.643
Patri.

12:40.431 --> 12:43.739
Patri, I care for you,

12:44.124 --> 12:46.118
but I'm not asking...

12:48.613 --> 12:50.852
What do you want from me, uncle?

12:50.948 --> 12:53.604
You saw what happened this morning?

12:54.312 --> 12:57.076
Yeah, they've all gone crazy.

12:57.139 --> 13:00.192
That's nothing compared
to what's comin',

13:00.530 --> 13:03.826
and to make it happen, I need your help.

13:04.423 --> 13:05.735
To do what?

13:05.803 --> 13:08.918
To bring back the only
one who kept them in line,

13:08.985 --> 13:11.289
before all hell broke loose.

13:13.235 --> 13:15.270
Patri...

13:15.335 --> 13:16.817
Patri...

13:16.884 --> 13:21.580
We all gotta do our part.

13:23.280 --> 13:25.063
Understand?

13:26.639 --> 13:28.743
Understand, Patrizia?

13:53.403 --> 13:57.337
Maria, still there? Get back home, move!

14:05.460 --> 14:09.022
- Patrizia, you're back?
- Honey, everything ok?

14:09.085 --> 14:11.381
Go over Science with me?

14:11.437 --> 14:14.442
Later, let me get cooking, it's late.

14:37.359 --> 14:40.424
- Forget anything?
- Thank you!

15:09.633 --> 15:12.373
- Hey!
- You're an idiot!

15:12.437 --> 15:14.096
Oh, c'mon!

15:14.160 --> 15:16.351
Think you should go around like that?

15:16.418 --> 15:18.412
Cover up, it's chilly.

15:18.463 --> 15:21.388
You washed me when I was
little, now you get shocked?

15:21.453 --> 15:24.682
Now you're all hairy, you're disgusting!

15:25.019 --> 15:27.394
Go set the table, move.

15:56.889 --> 15:59.142
Smoking again, huh?

15:59.198 --> 16:00.705
Just one.

16:00.773 --> 16:02.384
You're smoking again.

16:02.447 --> 16:04.125
Yeah, and so?

16:05.076 --> 16:06.948
You're edgy?

16:10.980 --> 16:14.033
I saw who brought you home tonight.

16:14.952 --> 16:17.216
What's he want from us?

16:19.379 --> 16:21.466
I have to do something

16:22.226 --> 16:25.533
and if I do it, we'll all be better off.

16:26.707 --> 16:29.149
Be careful.

16:36.461 --> 16:39.075
- Hey!
- You can smoke but I can't?

16:39.143 --> 16:43.582
I'm me and you're you!
Go to bed, school's tomorrow.

17:04.894 --> 17:06.728
Listen,

17:07.598 --> 17:10.076
I don't care about me,

17:10.420 --> 17:13.358
but if anything happens to
my sisters or my brother,

17:13.411 --> 17:15.661
I'll grab you by the balls and kill you.

17:15.732 --> 17:17.775
Don't worry.

17:18.409 --> 17:21.626
Do you know what
Lady Annalisa's doing tomorrow?

17:22.771 --> 17:24.336
Playing cards.

17:25.506 --> 17:27.133
Where?

17:28.404 --> 17:30.858
At the Marquis', near the museum.

17:30.931 --> 17:32.607
You're a smart girl,

17:32.665 --> 17:35.545
I knew you'd have the right info.

18:00.737 --> 18:03.209
Got on the perfume I bought you?

18:03.597 --> 18:05.067
Yes, sure.

18:05.134 --> 18:07.614
Not true, come here.

18:12.847 --> 18:15.236
You stink. Know why?

18:15.569 --> 18:18.432
You use "Eau de Bitch", like you.

18:18.500 --> 18:20.798
Think you can fool me?

18:20.875 --> 18:22.587
Think so, Marinella?

18:22.656 --> 18:26.392
If I smell shit, think I'll
reckon it's chocolate?

18:42.163 --> 18:45.959
Grasso, Gargiulo, Gargiano...

19:02.536 --> 19:04.306
Sweetheart!

19:05.198 --> 19:08.499
- How's it goin', okay?
- Mom, how are you?

19:08.564 --> 19:10.028
Auntie!

19:18.204 --> 19:21.325
- You're too skinny.
- Nah, I'm fine!

19:21.375 --> 19:24.675
Your mom and I brought
eggplant parmesan.

19:25.577 --> 19:28.063
What's new, Marinella?

19:28.115 --> 19:31.980
Nothing, I keep your mother
company while I wait for you.

19:32.037 --> 19:33.816
Time never passes.

19:33.884 --> 19:35.815
Know what she says every evening?

19:35.864 --> 19:39.259
She feels she's in jail too
because she can't live without you.

19:39.307 --> 19:43.876
Don't worry, i'll be out soon,
we'll make up for lost time.

19:44.202 --> 19:47.301
The toughest thing is
being without you, my love.

19:47.355 --> 19:49.832
When I get out, I'll chew you up!

19:50.685 --> 19:52.832
Listen to me!

19:53.730 --> 19:56.404
Now that our Spanish friend's gone,

19:56.461 --> 19:59.247
things are changing fast, understand?

19:59.295 --> 20:00.876
I know, Mom,

20:00.931 --> 20:04.698
soon as I'm out, I'll get
back in shape, move around.

20:05.098 --> 20:07.460
No, Lelluccio, you're fine like this,

20:07.489 --> 20:10.067
just stay calm.

20:10.115 --> 20:13.067
Then where you're out
we'll get moving again.

20:13.115 --> 20:15.213
Just trust your mom, okay?

20:15.586 --> 20:18.068
I do, Mom. I know.

20:18.112 --> 20:19.777
I'll take care of you.

20:19.840 --> 20:22.233
I know how to get you back in shape.

20:22.285 --> 20:26.171
Now let's take care of this little
doll who cries for you every night.

20:26.227 --> 20:29.259
When you're out, you'll know how

20:29.324 --> 20:32.311
to give her some affection, your way.

20:33.357 --> 20:35.423
You're so beautiful!

20:50.026 --> 20:51.700
It's late now,

20:51.744 --> 20:55.209
drop me off first,
then take Marinella home.

21:13.964 --> 21:15.760
All in.

21:21.358 --> 21:23.179
Call.

21:25.946 --> 21:28.240
Lady Annalisa, with all due respect,

21:28.289 --> 21:31.000
we use money at this table.

21:35.205 --> 21:37.163
Kid!

21:47.435 --> 21:50.671
Is this okay? Am I in the game?

22:00.612 --> 22:02.280
Flush.

22:05.656 --> 22:08.077
If you don't mind...

22:50.137 --> 22:52.500
Call.

22:57.012 --> 22:59.919
Don't move, hear me?

23:00.930 --> 23:03.788
No bullshit and no one gets hurt.

23:04.135 --> 23:05.521
Shut up!

23:10.791 --> 23:12.778
- Freeze!
- I'm not movin'!

23:12.839 --> 23:15.049
Do you know who I am?

23:16.951 --> 23:18.924
I don't give a fuck.

23:19.936 --> 23:21.833
I'm Scianel.

23:22.853 --> 23:25.645
You know why they call me that?

23:26.682 --> 23:29.151
Because I know perfumes.

23:35.326 --> 23:37.853
And you already stink of death.

23:42.210 --> 23:43.852
Let's go, let's go!

23:43.911 --> 23:44.869
Let's go!

23:44.910 --> 23:47.701
Grab the bag and leave!

24:07.849 --> 24:09.692
Lady Annalisa...

24:10.726 --> 24:12.790
On my way.

24:14.114 --> 24:17.036
- We have to go.
- What's the witch want?

24:17.080 --> 24:19.830
She's been robbed,
I have to bring the car.

24:20.211 --> 24:23.114
- Take me home first.
- Sure.

24:52.601 --> 24:55.058
It's all set up, Don Pietro:

24:55.406 --> 24:57.250
the house, the messenger...

24:57.305 --> 24:59.258
all set.

25:02.625 --> 25:04.131
Tomorrow.

25:07.028 --> 25:08.743
Tomorrow.

25:10.862 --> 25:13.071
Or there's this.

25:13.128 --> 25:16.499
It's short, has white beading
and goes with everything.

25:16.557 --> 25:18.113
- Pretty!
- Isn't it?

25:18.175 --> 25:21.106
- All ragged...
- It's the fashion.

25:21.184 --> 25:23.635
Know what happened to the tobacco lady?

25:23.709 --> 25:25.184
No, what?

25:25.247 --> 25:29.001
The cops arrested a guy going
through her neighbor's window.

25:29.067 --> 25:30.586
So what's that to her?

25:30.653 --> 25:32.583
It was her husband!

25:32.646 --> 25:34.388
He was naked.

25:35.940 --> 25:38.067
Wait just a moment.

25:43.936 --> 25:47.656
She had me bring the dress
back, says it brings bad luck.

25:47.711 --> 25:49.519
Why, what happened?

25:49.583 --> 25:52.640
They robbed her at the Marquis',
they took all her money.

25:53.898 --> 25:57.632
She's sure they knew she was there

25:57.703 --> 25:59.624
and she's out for blood.

26:35.989 --> 26:37.636
Hello?

28:12.307 --> 28:14.250
See this girl?

28:14.311 --> 28:18.032
She's the only one who comes
into your house, okay?

28:23.907 --> 28:27.855
In here there's a mozzarella,
two sausages and three jars of sauce.

28:27.920 --> 28:31.461
And that's what it's always gotta be,

28:31.537 --> 28:33.314
even when the guest comes,

28:33.358 --> 28:36.813
don't change your habits one bit, ok?

28:36.877 --> 28:39.198
There's two of us now,
but later three.

28:39.607 --> 28:40.865
So?

28:41.583 --> 28:44.160
What if it's not enough?

28:46.070 --> 28:48.027
Go on a diet.

28:48.398 --> 28:50.119
Come here, Patrizia.

28:51.084 --> 28:52.769
Uncle!

28:53.730 --> 28:57.904
- The witch suspects everyone.
- Get a grip on your nerves.

28:58.273 --> 28:59.878
In here.

29:07.776 --> 29:09.517
He'll be here.

29:12.772 --> 29:15.307
- What's my part?
- The messenger.

29:15.371 --> 29:17.853
- He talks just ti you.
- What do I tell him?

29:17.919 --> 29:21.086
everything that happens outside,
you'll be the messenger.

29:21.719 --> 29:24.732
You gotta bring him everything he needs.

29:25.088 --> 29:28.480
You'll be his eyes, his
ears and his mouth.

29:28.548 --> 29:30.680
It's important, Patri.

29:33.808 --> 29:35.866
Why me?

29:35.940 --> 29:38.438
Because no one would think it's you.

29:39.368 --> 29:41.088
What's in it for me?

29:41.162 --> 29:43.323
A thousand euro a week.

29:43.386 --> 29:45.715
Just to be a messenger?

29:45.775 --> 29:47.907
You're a smart girl

29:48.515 --> 29:51.096
if he likes you, your life will change,

29:51.164 --> 29:52.686
understand?

30:04.961 --> 30:06.979
I'm back, my heart,

30:09.730 --> 30:11.931
I'll never leave you again.

30:58.336 --> 31:00.115
Who's this?

31:00.169 --> 31:02.627
My niece Patrizia, Don Pietro.

31:03.223 --> 31:05.711
Got no tongue?

31:05.762 --> 31:09.055
Sure, but she knows when to use it.

31:32.999 --> 31:35.434
Patri, come with me.

31:36.737 --> 31:38.375
There.

31:41.726 --> 31:43.460
Twist!

31:43.510 --> 31:44.773
Lift!

31:49.306 --> 31:50.900
The other one.

31:51.537 --> 31:53.334
Fast!

32:01.631 --> 32:03.810
Go on, Don Pietro.

32:09.555 --> 32:10.944
Go!

32:13.510 --> 32:15.307
Fast!

32:18.884 --> 32:20.538
Take this!

34:07.337 --> 34:09.119
Who are you?

34:09.157 --> 34:11.014
Agostino, the grocery boy.

34:12.369 --> 34:15.206
Bear with me, go for a walk.

34:21.425 --> 34:23.181
Come here.

34:24.784 --> 34:27.059
What you got to say, grocery boy?

34:27.702 --> 34:29.574
My cousin...

34:30.494 --> 34:33.353
goes with a guy from the Third World

34:33.672 --> 34:37.581
and I heard him braggin'.

34:38.251 --> 34:40.996
- What was he saying?
- He was saying...

34:41.641 --> 34:44.164
He screwed...

34:46.367 --> 34:48.487
Lady Annalisa.

34:49.748 --> 34:51.608
And then?

34:51.643 --> 34:54.074
Stealing all that money

34:54.643 --> 34:56.793
was better than getting laid.

35:00.818 --> 35:02.597
Come here.

35:05.547 --> 35:07.512
Good kid, grocery boy!

35:07.545 --> 35:10.264
I'll give you a nice present! Go on!

35:14.492 --> 35:17.644
And now we'll take some
dicks outta my ass.

36:47.219 --> 36:49.253
Your tattoo...

36:53.952 --> 36:56.507
I got it when dad died,

36:56.882 --> 36:58.615
that's what he called me.

37:12.313 --> 37:15.987
If you were a lioness,
you wouldn't need a tattoo.

37:37.625 --> 37:40.036
We gotta move, Scianel got the robber.

37:40.083 --> 37:41.996
- Who is he?
- A guy from the neighborhood.

37:42.067 --> 37:44.692
He counts shit, he
could never do it alone.

37:44.746 --> 37:46.777
- He's still alive?
- Yeah, I know where.

37:46.849 --> 37:49.728
We gotta get to him fast!
Scianel did things her way,

37:49.784 --> 37:51.958
but we're an alliance,
no one acts alone.

38:07.980 --> 38:09.998
My money.

38:17.585 --> 38:19.998
Money comes and goes, kid,

38:20.047 --> 38:23.163
once your life is gone,
it won't come back again.

38:24.978 --> 38:28.742
I can give you all I took.

38:28.798 --> 38:30.936
No, mama's boy,

38:30.992 --> 38:32.693
that's not it.

38:32.757 --> 38:35.871
You can no longer give
back what you took from me.

38:35.927 --> 38:38.605
Wait, what did you say?

38:38.650 --> 38:41.297
It was better than getting laid.

38:41.346 --> 38:43.204
That so?

38:43.253 --> 38:45.168
Now we'll see if it's true.

38:45.550 --> 38:48.190
I want some of the fun too.

38:52.726 --> 38:55.467
Who knows if we'll find him alive.

38:56.094 --> 38:59.793
- Can't reason with Scianel.
- With me neither, Gabriele.

39:43.456 --> 39:45.248
What the fuck are you doin'?

39:49.088 --> 39:51.338
Ciro, what the fuck are you doin'?

39:52.648 --> 39:54.699
Ciro, what are you doing?

39:57.994 --> 40:00.570
We need him alive, not dead!

40:06.199 --> 40:08.068
Who ordered you?

40:08.735 --> 40:11.795
No one, we did it alone.

40:11.840 --> 40:13.797
That's funny, huh!

40:13.853 --> 40:16.579
This morning you didn't know
your ass from your elbow

40:16.617 --> 40:18.405
and now you're a tough guy?

40:18.463 --> 40:20.894
I know you know important things.

40:22.456 --> 40:26.289
Only I can save your life,
but you gotta come clean.

40:28.762 --> 40:30.936
Who ordered you?

40:33.143 --> 40:35.248
Pietro Savastano.

40:35.601 --> 40:37.525
He's back.

40:47.592 --> 40:51.498
Now let's blow this shit to Hell!

40:51.559 --> 40:53.074
Guys!

41:00.791 --> 41:04.019
He has to die for what he did to me.

41:04.708 --> 41:07.250
I gave him my word,

41:07.297 --> 41:09.641
Angelo's gotta live.

41:20.409 --> 41:22.331
Concern in Naples for a fire

41:22.791 --> 41:25.288
that broke out in an apartment downtown.

41:25.333 --> 41:27.630
A short circuit sparked the fire...

41:27.702 --> 41:29.974
I made these myself.

41:33.436 --> 41:35.766
What's the word from outside?

41:37.574 --> 41:40.947
In the shop all the wives are
talking about what happened.

41:42.177 --> 41:45.105
They say there's tension
among the secessionists.

41:47.235 --> 41:50.005
They're scared another
war might break out.

41:55.956 --> 41:57.693
That's what you want, isn't it?

42:15.507 --> 42:17.023
That's enough.

42:24.715 --> 42:26.896
Know how to make scialatelli?

42:28.498 --> 42:30.358
With shellfish.

42:31.943 --> 42:34.190
And you need a spoon.

42:41.440 --> 42:43.559
Go get a fork.

42:53.811 --> 42:55.590
Asshole!

43:14.623 --> 43:16.378
Sit down.

43:44.527 --> 43:46.432
This food's shit...

43:46.496 --> 43:48.554
want me to eat alone too?

44:00.193 --> 44:03.992
Guys, let's devastate the Third World
and the Berlingieri area,

44:04.063 --> 44:06.576
we can wipe out Savastano
once and for all.

44:06.637 --> 44:08.766
- He's gotta eat his own shit.
- Yeah.

44:08.824 --> 44:11.090
- We'll eat him alive!
- We gotta look for him.

44:11.152 --> 44:13.204
- He did it.
- We gotta find him fast!

44:13.257 --> 44:16.396
- That's our house.
- Still givin' orders!

44:16.456 --> 44:19.797
Pietro Savastano is back to raise Hell.

44:23.552 --> 44:26.036
He wanted to slap you...

44:29.367 --> 44:33.246
because he knows you're
like a Neapolitan Mastiff.

44:33.621 --> 44:35.597
You fly off the handle.

44:37.552 --> 44:40.501
You don't understand his game.

44:41.731 --> 44:44.110
He wants us to rack up deaths,

44:45.003 --> 44:47.612
because deaths bring cops.

44:47.974 --> 44:49.711
It'll be crawling.

44:49.755 --> 44:52.231
And with the cops around,

44:52.278 --> 44:54.643
the dealing spots get blocked.

44:55.547 --> 44:59.070
Then people will say
they got no life with us,

45:01.211 --> 45:04.018
it was better when
Pietro Savastano was here.

45:04.077 --> 45:05.943
Life was good then!

45:06.019 --> 45:09.268
If you don't want war, what do you want?

45:11.490 --> 45:13.208
Peace.

45:15.443 --> 45:18.902
They'll think they can walk all over us.

45:19.255 --> 45:20.934
Annalisa...

45:23.429 --> 45:25.452
who's dumber,

45:26.972 --> 45:29.809
the one led around on a leash like a dog

45:31.083 --> 45:33.923
or the one putting the
chain around his neck?

45:39.768 --> 45:41.858
So, what do we do?

45:42.844 --> 45:44.873
Cal Malamore,

45:46.153 --> 45:48.719
tell him we want a meeting.

45:49.204 --> 45:51.518
- I want to talk to him.
- Ciro!

45:53.822 --> 45:56.242
What the fuck does this mean?

46:35.438 --> 46:37.016
Yes?

47:08.054 --> 47:09.755
Hello.

47:31.746 --> 47:34.853
What's under there? Why the bandage?

47:46.039 --> 47:49.164
Will you tell me or
do I rip it off myself?

48:12.463 --> 48:15.018
I have some news for you,

48:16.262 --> 48:18.452
that Malamore knows.

48:23.496 --> 48:25.422
They want to deal.

48:48.512 --> 48:50.719
But not with you.

49:12.221 --> 49:14.177
Then with who?

49:19.797 --> 49:21.911
With Gennaro,

49:21.965 --> 49:23.896
your son.

49:24.496 --> 49:26.791
With Gennaro?

49:43.027 --> 49:45.297
Cover that wound.

49:55.668 --> 49:58.186
ROMA, EUR

49:59.552 --> 50:01.137
Come in.

50:11.074 --> 50:13.898
Well? What do you say?

50:18.538 --> 50:21.092
What's wrong, don't you like it?

50:38.956 --> 50:40.704
Okay.
