00:12.930 --> 00:15.307
Does anyone know
what this meeting's about?

00:15.390 --> 00:20.854
No. I hope it's important. I was translating
the cuneiform tablet we found on P30-255.

00:20.938 --> 00:23.565
I have to finish recalibrating
MALP sensors...

00:23.649 --> 00:26.902
..for long-term reconnaissance
on P5X-3D7.

00:26.985 --> 00:29.613
I was unable to complete my kelno'reem.

00:30.614 --> 00:33.784
I was just about to do
something important.

00:36.245 --> 00:38.705
All right, people. As you were.

00:38.830 --> 00:41.291
We have ourselves a situation.

00:41.875 --> 00:46.004
Early this morning
at approximately 0400 hours...

00:46.088 --> 00:49.591
..the base switchboard
received the following call.

00:49.716 --> 00:52.886
(man) Hello. This is a message
for Colonel Jack O'Neill...

00:53.011 --> 00:55.055
..and anyone else who's listening in.

00:55.180 --> 00:59.643
I know this call is being monitored,
but don't bother to set up a trace.

00:59.768 --> 01:02.604
I'm at a phone booth in Butte,
Montana. I'll be long gone...

01:02.688 --> 01:06.984
..before yourBlack Ops teams can get
here. You're not dealing with an amateur.

01:07.067 --> 01:11.363
I know all about Roswell
and the Kennedy cover-ups, and the...

01:11.446 --> 01:13.907
(fast-forward)

01:14.032 --> 01:16.827
He goes on like that for a while.

01:17.661 --> 01:21.665
..and the CIA-sanctioned
microwave harassment, and the...

01:22.207 --> 01:24.251
Quite a while.

01:24.376 --> 01:26.420
(fast-forward)

01:29.131 --> 01:31.091
..and the lizardpeople,...

01:31.216 --> 01:34.970
..but the point is none ofthese
compare to your little secret, Colonel.

01:35.095 --> 01:39.016
I'm talking about a large circular
object, discovered in Egypt,...

01:39.141 --> 01:43.228
..currently residing in a missile silo
under Cheyenne Mountain.

01:43.312 --> 01:46.148
I believe you call it the Stargate.

01:46.231 --> 01:49.484
And now that I've got
yourattention, I want to meet.

01:49.610 --> 01:54.573
Tomorrow, 11am, at the new
Cloverleafrestaurant in Billings.

01:54.698 --> 01:57.242
And, Colonel - come alone.

02:02.080 --> 02:04.124
Interesting.

02:05.501 --> 02:07.878
It would appear security
has been breached.

02:07.961 --> 02:12.424
I wanna know who this man is. I wanna
know how he got his information,...

02:12.549 --> 02:15.427
..and I want to know
who he's been talking to.

02:15.511 --> 02:17.888
You leave in half an hour.

03:46.268 --> 03:48.562
Colonel O'Neill?

03:49.354 --> 03:53.025
- Yeah.
- Sorry I'm late. I think I was followed.

03:55.235 --> 03:58.238
- You sure?
- Yeah. But don't worry.

03:58.363 --> 04:02.409
- I managed to lose 'em.
- Very professional.

04:02.492 --> 04:05.913
- What's your name?
- You can call me Martin.

04:06.038 --> 04:08.790
OK, Martin. What's this about?

04:08.874 --> 04:12.044
If you don't mind, before we get started...

04:18.759 --> 04:21.386
Just like to check you for transmitters.

04:23.722 --> 04:25.766
OK.

04:27.059 --> 04:29.102
You're clean.

04:35.025 --> 04:38.278
You understand a man in my position
has to take precautions.

04:38.362 --> 04:40.739
Yeah. You never know who's listening.

04:40.864 --> 04:44.785
Exactly. I don't know about you,
but I always feel like I'm being watched.

04:44.910 --> 04:47.621
Come on, Martin, let's get to it.
What's goin' on?

04:47.704 --> 04:51.625
- You know as well as I do, Colonel.
- I don't.

04:57.631 --> 05:02.177
OK, here we go. If he's got a driver's
licence we should be able to find him.

05:02.261 --> 05:07.683
I've never been on a stakeout. Shouldn't
we have doughnuts or something?

05:09.184 --> 05:11.311
A top-secret government programme...

05:11.395 --> 05:14.565
..involving instantaneous travel
to other solar systems...

05:14.648 --> 05:17.568
..by means of a device
known as a Stargate.

05:18.402 --> 05:23.031
Sounds like a good idea for a TV show.
If you're into that sort of thing.

05:23.824 --> 05:28.287
Colonel, let's not play games. If it isn't
true, why would you come all this way?

05:28.370 --> 05:30.664
OK. The truth.

05:31.790 --> 05:35.919
There is a top-secret government
programme called Project Stargate.

05:36.003 --> 05:40.132
- I knew it!
- But it's nothing to do with space travel.

05:40.215 --> 05:42.426
What does it have to do with?

05:42.551 --> 05:44.595
Magnets.

05:45.721 --> 05:49.057
- What the hell is that supposed to mean?
- I've already said too much.

05:49.183 --> 05:53.312
- You're not taking this seriously.
- No, I'm not.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.981
- I need help.
- Why? What seems to be...

05:56.064 --> 05:58.775
I have to go through the Stargate.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.695
- Marty, I don't...
- No. I mean it.

06:01.778 --> 06:04.406
I've come to realise
that I don't belong here.

06:04.489 --> 06:09.036
For the longest time I was obsessed
with all those alien conspiracies.

06:09.203 --> 06:12.706
Crop circles, cow mutilations,
the Apollo cover-up...

06:12.789 --> 06:14.917
I thought the lunar landings were a hoax.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.961
No! That was a story
created by the government...

06:18.045 --> 06:21.715
..to direct attention from the real cover-up.
Everybody knows that.

06:21.840 --> 06:27.513
Anyway, one day I'm on line
and I find this conspiracy chat room,...

06:27.596 --> 06:30.682
..and they're talking about
something called the Stargate.

06:30.807 --> 06:36.146
Most of it was disinformation,
but the word "Stargate" stuck in my head.

06:36.230 --> 06:40.150
It triggered what I later realised
was a suppressed memory.

06:40.901 --> 06:46.907
You see, Colonel O'Neill, the truth is,
I'm not just interested in outer space...

06:47.658 --> 06:49.952
I'm from outer space.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.166
Check.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.670
(Carter) We got something.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.382
That's him. Martin Lloyd.

07:03.507 --> 07:06.426
Brown hair, hazel eyes.

07:08.595 --> 07:12.975
He has a criminal record. He was arrested
for protesting outside a TV station.

07:13.100 --> 07:17.479
He claimed subliminal advertising
was controlling his thoughts.

07:18.689 --> 07:20.649
- Do you have an address?
- Oh, yeah.

07:20.774 --> 07:24.528
I could get the prescription
of his glasses if I wanted.

07:25.612 --> 07:30.742
- You still don't believe me? I'm an alien.
- You look pretty human to me.

07:30.868 --> 07:36.373
No. What I believe is that thousands of
years ago people were taken from Earth.

07:36.582 --> 07:40.711
Maybe as part of some experiment,
maybe as slaves... Who knows?

07:40.794 --> 07:44.214
But the point is there are
entire civilisations up there...

07:44.298 --> 07:47.301
..descended from those original humans.

07:47.676 --> 07:50.929
- Now that's just crazy talk.
- You want proof?

07:52.848 --> 07:55.851
I can give you proof.
I can show you my ship.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.939
Look, Marty, I'm a busy man...

08:01.023 --> 08:04.943
..and you don't strike me as any
great threat to national security...

08:09.114 --> 08:11.992
But, as you know,
it never hurts to be thorough.

08:12.075 --> 08:14.286
So...

08:14.411 --> 08:16.788
..show me.

08:29.259 --> 08:31.303
It's just over the next ridge.

08:31.386 --> 08:34.972
The ship's mostly buried,
but I know exactly where it is.

08:35.097 --> 08:39.561
Marty, what makes you think
you can trust me with all this?

08:39.686 --> 08:42.940
I can't explain it, Colonel.
I just have a gut feeling.

08:43.023 --> 08:46.193
Like... we have something in common.

08:46.318 --> 08:49.404
Well, that's very flattering.
But I'm not an alien.

08:49.488 --> 08:51.949
Oh, I know that. It's somethin' else.

08:53.325 --> 08:55.369
Here. Up here.

09:14.555 --> 09:17.975
- This is it.
- Nice place.

09:23.313 --> 09:25.357
Hello?

09:43.375 --> 09:45.419
Oh, boy.

09:51.884 --> 09:55.220
Something tells me we don't
need to worry about this guy.

09:55.304 --> 09:59.766
Except for the fact that he happens
to be very close to the truth.

10:05.397 --> 10:07.357
He looks familiar.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.526
(toy gun noises)

10:10.319 --> 10:13.989
It would appear this weapon is ineffective.

10:39.806 --> 10:42.267
Oh, hello.

10:42.351 --> 10:45.771
Sam, you're gonna wanna
take a look at this.

10:52.444 --> 10:54.905
Whoa. That's quite a collection.

10:55.405 --> 10:59.326
Tranquillisers, antidepressants,
antipsychotics...

10:59.451 --> 11:03.205
Looks like he was being treated
for a number of psychiatric problems.

11:03.288 --> 11:05.958
Yeah. Why doesn't that surprise me?

11:12.089 --> 11:14.883
Marty, we've been walkin'
around for half an hour.

11:14.967 --> 11:19.930
I don't understand it. The clearing where I
landed should be round here somewhere.

11:20.055 --> 11:22.182
How do you lose a spaceship?

11:22.307 --> 11:26.228
Well, my memory isn't so good.
Sometimes I get a little confused.

11:26.311 --> 11:29.481
- I think it might be the medication.
- Well, there you go.

11:29.565 --> 11:32.317
Listen. I'm goin' back to the car.

11:32.401 --> 11:35.654
No, wait! You can't. Please.
It's around here, I know it is.

11:35.779 --> 11:39.867
Marty, listen! There is no spaceship.
You're not an alien.

11:39.950 --> 11:43.453
- You don't understand!
- I get that a lot.

11:49.334 --> 11:52.171
Come on. I'll drive you back to town.

11:58.760 --> 12:02.848
- Find anything?
- Oh, yeah. It's a diary. Take a look at this.

12:05.267 --> 12:10.230
"April 12th. Someone's been going
through my garbage. Suspect CIA."

12:10.355 --> 12:16.445
"May 2nd. Comb missing. Suspect CIA
stole it to acquire genetic identification."

12:16.528 --> 12:21.408
"June 26th. Comb found behind dresser.
Disposed of it in case of tampering."

12:21.533 --> 12:23.827
"Bought new comb,
39 cents at Shop-More."

12:23.911 --> 12:29.291
I'm telling you, this is a complete waste of
time. This guy's got paranoid delusions.

12:38.467 --> 12:40.677
What've we got?

12:40.802 --> 12:43.430
Activity in the house.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.560
Looks like Martin's got visitors.

12:48.644 --> 12:54.983
That's not all. See the big guy? Watch
what happens when I go to thermal scan.

13:06.453 --> 13:09.206
Definitely not human.

13:20.551 --> 13:23.303
- Come in.
- Sir...

13:25.097 --> 13:29.268
I have the results of the tests done on
the medication from Martin's house.

13:29.351 --> 13:33.897
- That was fast.
- Preliminary analysis done in Montana.

13:33.981 --> 13:37.901
- There are some anomalies.
- Meaning?

13:38.569 --> 13:41.572
Several unidentifiable
chemicals were present.

13:41.655 --> 13:44.491
I believe that the drugs
may have been tampered with.

13:44.575 --> 13:46.869
- For what purpose?
- I can't say.

13:46.994 --> 13:50.414
For all we know, the medication
may be the cause of his delusions.

13:50.539 --> 13:56.378
- I'll mention that to Colonel O'Neill.
- The psychiatrist's name is on the label.

13:56.712 --> 13:58.839
Your phone call piqued my curiosity.

13:58.964 --> 14:03.177
I don't often get requests for information
from the military.

14:03.260 --> 14:07.890
Well, this concerns a particular
patient of yours. Martin Lloyd?

14:08.015 --> 14:11.935
I see. Of course you understand
that doctor-patient privilege...

14:12.019 --> 14:14.313
..prohibits me from discussing clients.

14:14.396 --> 14:17.191
This is a matter of national
security, Dr Tanner.

14:17.274 --> 14:19.735
That privilege doesn't exist in this case.

14:19.818 --> 14:24.198
National security, involving Martin?
I find that hard to believe.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.241
Why do you say that?

14:26.325 --> 14:30.412
Let's put it this way. People like
Martin sometimes compensate...

14:30.496 --> 14:34.166
..for feelings of insignificance
by creating elaborate fantasies...

14:34.291 --> 14:37.794
..in which they are the centre
and focus of all attention.

14:37.878 --> 14:43.091
Though usually harmless, they often try
and draw others into their delusions.

14:43.217 --> 14:46.053
That's what's happened here.

14:58.899 --> 15:00.943
(rumbling)

15:01.068 --> 15:03.111
(man hums)

15:04.279 --> 15:05.989
(clunk)

15:06.073 --> 15:08.116
(rumbling dies down)

15:31.765 --> 15:33.892
- (knock at door)
- Colonel O'Neill?

15:33.976 --> 15:36.770
Colonel O'Neill, are you in there?

15:44.611 --> 15:48.282
- Martin?
- Please, I have to see you.

15:53.745 --> 15:57.249
So good you're here.
You have no idea what's...

15:59.334 --> 16:04.131
- Who's he?
- Uh, my friend. Murray.

16:06.341 --> 16:08.552
- You trust him?
- Oh, yeah.

16:10.262 --> 16:14.808
- I guess it's OK for me, then.
- Good. Glad you're comfortable.

16:17.853 --> 16:21.023
Don't you wanna know how I found you?

16:21.106 --> 16:23.734
Uh... OK.

16:25.152 --> 16:29.948
I noticed in your car there was a map
from the Sleep-Rite motel chain.

16:30.032 --> 16:33.619
- I checked every one in town.
- There's two.

16:34.870 --> 16:39.416
I'm surprised a man in your position
wouldn't do more to maintain your cover.

16:39.500 --> 16:42.586
Marty, I'm not undercover.

16:44.922 --> 16:49.092
You think I'm makin' this all up.
Look at this.

16:56.391 --> 17:01.897
- Yes... It all makes sense now(!)
- I leaned it against the inside of my door.

17:01.980 --> 17:06.693
When I got home it was on the ground,
meaning someone was there.

17:06.777 --> 17:10.446
If you prop it up against the inside
of the door, how do you get out?

17:10.571 --> 17:15.202
Through the window. Think I'm
so stupid I go out my own front door?

17:15.285 --> 17:19.915
- So you leave the window unlocked?
- Yeah. But I put a hair on the windowsill.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.876
- Now if that's gone when I get back...
- Marty...

17:22.960 --> 17:26.046
The point is someone was there!
They're after me.

17:26.171 --> 17:30.008
You have to help me. Please.
I'm running out of time.

17:30.092 --> 17:34.096
- What do you want?
- I wanna go home.

17:34.179 --> 17:37.349
You have to take me through the Stargate.

17:38.559 --> 17:43.605
Martin may be delusional, but there are
still some unanswered questions here.

17:43.730 --> 17:47.067
- Such as?
- Well, he's taking a lot of medication.

17:47.401 --> 17:50.904
- No more than necessary.
- Doxepin, haloperidol,...

17:50.988 --> 17:53.907
- ..perphenazine, lithium, Valium...
- Major, please.

17:53.991 --> 17:57.578
I don't have time to discuss
the benefits of psychopharmacology.

17:57.661 --> 17:59.788
This interview is over.

17:59.872 --> 18:05.002
Dr Tanner, we obtained samples of
Martin's medication and ran an analysis.

18:05.127 --> 18:08.881
Apparently the drugs have been laced
with indeterminate chemicals.

18:08.964 --> 18:12.718
- That's absurd. It must be some mistake.
- The tests were very thorough.

18:12.843 --> 18:16.680
I just write the prescriptions.
I don't make the drugs.

18:16.763 --> 18:20.934
We're not accusing you of anything.
We're just looking for answers.

18:21.018 --> 18:24.438
You realise this investigation
will only fuel Martin's paranoia.

18:24.563 --> 18:26.690
We don't have a choice.

18:26.773 --> 18:31.403
And we are gonna get to the bottom
of this with or without your help.

18:32.738 --> 18:35.282
I... don't know what else I can tell you.

18:35.449 --> 18:40.787
Does he have any friends or relatives
we can contact? Anyone else?

18:55.969 --> 18:58.514
This is his work address.

19:04.144 --> 19:06.772
It's the best I can do.

19:08.732 --> 19:11.902
I knew it would come to this.
They're gonna do tests on me,...

19:12.027 --> 19:16.406
..then dissect me like one of those
demented school biology experiments!

19:16.532 --> 19:18.742
- Marty, take it easy.
- I wanna go home.

19:18.867 --> 19:20.911
Sit!

19:25.040 --> 19:30.170
You gotta relax. Nobody's gonna
do anything to you, I promise.

19:31.880 --> 19:36.593
Now if, and I stress the word if,
there is such a thing,...

19:36.677 --> 19:41.473
..what makes you think your way home
is through this Stargate?

19:41.557 --> 19:42.641
I...

19:42.724 --> 19:48.647
I don't know. I, uh...
I get these ideas. Flashes.

19:49.231 --> 19:54.278
It's a little confusing, actually. I don't
even know for sure why I wanna go.

19:54.570 --> 19:59.616
It's just... a feeling.
Like I'm somebodythere.

19:59.741 --> 20:02.828
Like there's something
important for me to do there,...

20:02.953 --> 20:05.956
..more important than anything I do here.

20:06.081 --> 20:08.542
Can I have a glass of water?

20:09.960 --> 20:12.004
Yeah.

20:31.899 --> 20:34.443
Let me see those.

20:39.323 --> 20:41.200
You should go easy on this.

20:41.325 --> 20:44.912
- But...
- Just for a while. Trust me.

20:46.914 --> 20:50.167
- What about the symbols?
- What symbols?

20:50.709 --> 20:55.339
It's one of the things I see in the flashes.
There's seven of them.

20:55.422 --> 20:57.966
I wrote them down.

21:25.410 --> 21:27.454
Hello?

21:28.705 --> 21:32.125
- This is the place?
- Yeah.

21:33.043 --> 21:35.671
This is the address he gave us.

21:36.922 --> 21:38.966
It, uh...

21:39.633 --> 21:45.264
It doesn't really look like anybody's
place of work. There's no one here.

21:52.229 --> 21:55.023
Except for the guys with guns.

22:04.908 --> 22:08.162
Just cos I'm from another planet
I don't have rights?

22:08.287 --> 22:11.206
Doesn't the Geneva Convention
cover extraterrestrials?

22:11.290 --> 22:14.543
I have to remember
to go on line and look that up.

22:15.502 --> 22:17.462
Carter's not answering her phone.

22:17.546 --> 22:20.382
- Should they not have contacted us?
- Yep.

22:20.674 --> 22:24.595
You know, I think it would be a good idea
if I took some of my medication now.

22:24.720 --> 22:27.472
- I don't think so.
- If I go too long without it,...

22:27.556 --> 22:30.225
..l tend to get a little... nervous.

22:32.853 --> 22:35.230
No, really.

22:37.858 --> 22:40.319
Marty, sit down.

22:41.153 --> 22:44.990
Let's... talk about these symbols.

22:45.491 --> 22:50.704
- They mean somethin', don't they?
- I need you to think very carefully.

22:51.663 --> 22:54.666
- Where did you see them?
- I told you, I have these visions.

22:54.791 --> 22:57.669
I don't know where they come from.

22:59.171 --> 23:02.424
Maybe it has somethin'
to do with my implant.

23:02.674 --> 23:04.968
- Excuse me?
- They put an implant in my head.

23:05.093 --> 23:08.680
I always thought
they were sending me signals.

23:10.349 --> 23:12.726
To whom are you referring?

23:12.809 --> 23:16.063
You know: them. The secret government.

23:18.815 --> 23:22.236
The New World Order.
Black helicopters, underground bases...

23:22.361 --> 23:25.197
- Don't you read the papers?
- Marty, for God's sake!

23:25.280 --> 23:27.825
My neurologist didn't believe me either.

23:27.908 --> 23:33.997
But that's only because the implant is so
small it can't be read on a normal X-ray.

23:38.085 --> 23:40.462
All right, this is goin' nowhere.

23:41.296 --> 23:45.843
I'm gonna go look for Carter and Daniel.
Keep an eye on him.

23:51.306 --> 23:53.851
Hey... Where you goin'?

23:57.187 --> 23:59.231
Murray...

24:12.119 --> 24:14.663
OK, let's keep this simple.

24:15.664 --> 24:18.834
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

24:18.959 --> 24:22.296
The guys with the guns, which
means you answer ourquestions.

24:22.421 --> 24:25.174
So once again, who are you?

24:25.841 --> 24:29.094
I'm Dr Daniel Jackson.
This is Major Samantha Carter.

24:29.178 --> 24:32.598
- We're with the air force.
- What are you doing here?

24:32.723 --> 24:35.017
Classified.

24:35.142 --> 24:39.271
- What do you know about Martin Lloyd?
- Never heard of him.

24:39.354 --> 24:42.065
You were conducting
an illegal search in his house.

24:42.149 --> 24:45.068
No, we weren't.

24:47.529 --> 24:52.242
So who are you guys really? CIA? NID?

24:55.120 --> 24:58.123
What do you know about Martin Lloyd?

25:29.071 --> 25:31.698
- Can I come out yet?
- No.

25:41.041 --> 25:46.088
Psychiatrist's office was completely
empty, like no one had ever been there.

25:46.880 --> 25:50.133
- So what now, O'Neill?
- I got some people on it.

25:54.304 --> 25:58.600
- Where's Marty?
- He was insistent on having medication.

25:58.725 --> 26:00.936
(knock) Uh, Murray?

26:01.436 --> 26:07.109
Listen, I'm really sorry I tried to bite you,
and I realise it's totally out of line,...

26:07.234 --> 26:11.154
..but I was wondering if maybe
I could come out now?

26:13.866 --> 26:19.371
Or I could just stay in here.
That's good too.

26:20.414 --> 26:22.875
It's just I'm gettin' a little dizzy.

26:23.000 --> 26:27.713
I don't get it. How does a nut job like that
get a set of gate coordinates?

26:28.130 --> 26:30.174
(thud)

26:33.635 --> 26:35.679
Marty?

26:38.599 --> 26:41.268
Martin! You all right?

26:45.564 --> 26:47.608
Oh, crap!

26:47.733 --> 26:49.610
Marty! Marty!

26:49.693 --> 26:51.737
Come on, Marty!

26:51.862 --> 26:56.241
In hindsight, perhaps we should have
given him his medication, O'Neill.

26:56.366 --> 26:58.410
Colonel...

26:59.995 --> 27:02.873
I remember where my ship is.

27:07.794 --> 27:12.424
We know you were in Martin's house
because we have you on video.

27:13.967 --> 27:16.762
What can you tell us about him?

27:18.263 --> 27:20.307
- He's an associate.
- We know that.

27:20.432 --> 27:24.978
- We also know he's not from round here.
- Not from Montana?

27:26.813 --> 27:29.816
I think you know what I mean.

27:34.321 --> 27:39.284
We should've turned left at the bottom
of the ravine instead of turning right.

27:43.455 --> 27:46.250
Do you now believe Martin
about his spaceship?

27:46.333 --> 27:51.380
No. But he's the closest thing we've got
to a lead on Carter and Daniel.

27:53.841 --> 27:56.468
After you, Murray.

27:59.805 --> 28:01.682
This is it!

28:01.807 --> 28:04.893
I told you! This is the clearing.

28:05.727 --> 28:10.357
The ship is around here somewhere,
but remember, it's mostly buried,...

28:10.482 --> 28:13.485
..so keep your eyes open
and watch your step.

28:19.783 --> 28:21.827
This is it!

28:24.246 --> 28:28.625
I knew it was here.
I knew it! I'm not crazy.

28:46.727 --> 28:50.772
The material the object is made from
is definitely not terrestrial.

28:50.856 --> 28:54.276
We used sonar to get
the general size and shape.

28:54.401 --> 28:59.281
And I've enhanced the image by
extrapolating from the exposed portion.

28:59.364 --> 29:04.828
It should look something like this.
It's approximately 16 feet by 10 feet.

29:05.204 --> 29:07.247
That's not right.

29:07.331 --> 29:10.292
It's too small. That can't be my ship.

29:11.335 --> 29:16.381
- There's another ship out there?
- Could it be an escape pod?

29:17.549 --> 29:19.593
That's it!

29:20.469 --> 29:23.013
There must've been
some kind of malfunction.

29:23.138 --> 29:26.892
We abandoned the ship
and came down in the pod!

29:27.017 --> 29:30.354
We? There's more of you?

29:32.272 --> 29:34.816
- How many more?
- I'm not sure.

29:34.900 --> 29:39.947
It can't be too many, sir. From the size of
that thing, I'd say four, maybe five max.

29:40.072 --> 29:45.536
All this time I thought the governmentwas
watching me. What if it was the others?

29:46.119 --> 29:48.497
What would these others want?

29:48.580 --> 29:54.586
I don't know. Maybe they're afraid.
They don't want to be exposed.

29:55.087 --> 29:58.590
If that is the case, these others
may indeed be responsible...

29:58.715 --> 30:03.178
..for the disappearance
of Daniel Jackson and Major Carter.

30:05.430 --> 30:10.060
So you're telling me this man
is an ordinary technical sergeant?

30:10.352 --> 30:14.648
- I wouldn't say ordinary.
- He's very good at what he does.

30:14.857 --> 30:17.734
What's his area of expertise?

30:19.278 --> 30:21.738
Speech writer.

30:27.369 --> 30:29.580
What about this?

30:29.663 --> 30:32.207
That's very good.
Did you draw that yourself?

30:32.291 --> 30:35.294
- What is it?
- That's a duck, isn't it?

30:54.897 --> 30:57.441
We'll just wait here.

31:01.737 --> 31:05.866
Our home world was under attack.
We were sent out to find allies,...

31:05.949 --> 31:09.953
..but when we got here we realised
you weren't advanced enough to help us.

31:10.037 --> 31:12.164
Well, we have our moments.

31:12.247 --> 31:15.209
The enemy was too powerful.
They wanted to make us slaves.

31:15.292 --> 31:19.755
They wanted us
to worship them like gods.

31:22.174 --> 31:26.428
- The Goa'uld.
- Yes. That's it!

31:30.057 --> 31:31.767
Show him.

31:31.892 --> 31:34.895
The enemy of which you speak
enslaved my people,...

31:35.020 --> 31:40.609
..murdered my father, and banished
my wife and child from our people.

31:40.692 --> 31:44.279
I am branded with the symbol
of this false god.

31:44.404 --> 31:45.823
Murray!

31:45.906 --> 31:49.910
Colonel? We've completed the radiation
sweep. We're ready to open the hatch.

31:49.993 --> 31:53.413
- All right, let's do it.
- Wait, wait! You can't.

31:53.539 --> 31:55.916
The pod has remote sensors.

31:56.041 --> 32:00.295
If you penetrate the hull,
they're gonna know about it.

32:01.255 --> 32:05.384
Perhaps this can be used
to our advantage, O'Neill.

32:11.306 --> 32:14.893
I don't get this. These guys
know what a symbiote is,...

32:15.018 --> 32:19.314
..but if they were really NID they'd know
that Teal'c isn't a security threat.

32:19.398 --> 32:22.734
I don't know. That's why I hate
workin' for the government.

32:22.860 --> 32:26.363
Every department has its own agenda,
its own little secrets.

32:26.446 --> 32:29.158
Very true, Dr Jackson.

32:34.371 --> 32:37.374
Oh, yeah. Yup.
Didn't see that one coming(!)

32:37.457 --> 32:40.711
I understand your
reluctance to cooperate.

32:40.794 --> 32:45.174
In situations like this, information
is on a need-to-know basis.

32:45.257 --> 32:49.887
The fact of the matter is,
we're running out of time.

32:50.512 --> 32:53.599
I'm running out of patience.

32:53.724 --> 32:56.393
And I really need to know.

33:01.815 --> 33:05.152
You're not a real doctor, are you?

33:05.235 --> 33:07.279
(beeping)

33:11.033 --> 33:14.703
Looks like the experiment's
been discovered. What do we do?

33:14.995 --> 33:17.289
Get the van.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.587
- We're going for a ride?
- Not exactly.

33:31.386 --> 33:35.224
This is not a good idea.
Did I mention this is not a good idea?

33:35.349 --> 33:38.936
I don't exactly appreciate
being used as bait.

33:39.686 --> 33:43.982
Hang in there, Marty.
And stop talking into your lapel.

33:44.358 --> 33:48.111
Oh, it's easy for you guys,
all nice and cosy back in your van,...

33:48.237 --> 33:50.781
..eating your crullers and your bear claws.

33:51.448 --> 33:54.952
I'm the one standing out here risking my...

33:55.035 --> 33:57.246
We got company.

33:57.371 --> 34:01.750
I must say, Martin,
this is very disappointing.

34:01.875 --> 34:04.002
Stopped yourmedication, didn't you?

34:04.294 --> 34:08.757
I'm not crazy, and you're not
a psychiatrist. You see this?

34:08.841 --> 34:12.010
This is what brought us here.
I know it. I remember now.

34:12.177 --> 34:16.014
Martin, you've really made
a mess of things this time.

34:38.579 --> 34:41.831
Nice van. What do you call that colour?
Kind of a greyish-green?

34:41.956 --> 34:44.001
Just get in.

34:58.432 --> 35:00.475
All right, they're movin'.

35:03.937 --> 35:08.734
- So you gonna drug me again?
- Well, obviously that didn't work.

35:08.859 --> 35:12.529
I'm afraid we're gonna have
to take more drastic measures.

35:15.324 --> 35:17.367
You're not gonna kill me.

35:17.493 --> 35:20.037
You know how manypeople
know about this now?

35:20.120 --> 35:23.874
What about Major Carterand DrJackson?
You gonna kill all ofus?

35:24.833 --> 35:27.586
We're gonna do what we have to do.

35:31.381 --> 35:37.221
This isn't right. I know you - all of you.
We were on the ship together.

35:37.679 --> 35:41.600
We're soldiers, not murderers. That's why
you drugged me instead of killin' me.

35:41.683 --> 35:44.770
- Martin...
- It's not too late.

35:46.063 --> 35:48.690
Our people are at war. They need us.

35:48.774 --> 35:53.403
Martin, I hate to see you like this.
You were my best agent.

35:53.487 --> 35:58.033
I was never any kind of agent! You're just
saying that cos you think I'm bugged.

35:58.116 --> 36:01.119
- Well, aren't you?
- No, ofcourse not!

36:01.537 --> 36:06.083
This whole government agency thing -
it'sjust a cover.

36:06.542 --> 36:09.545
We're all really aliens, right?

36:09.628 --> 36:13.924
With all the secrecy and all the lies,
it's easy to get confused.

36:14.758 --> 36:18.095
I'm not confused. I know who I am.

36:19.221 --> 36:24.560
Why don't you just admit who we are?
We can all just go home.

36:26.728 --> 36:29.648
They have a Stargate!

36:37.698 --> 36:40.409
They stopped. Get to 'em.

37:03.098 --> 37:06.101
Seal off the area. No one in or out.

37:28.665 --> 37:31.210
- (whispers) Carter?
- Sir?

37:34.671 --> 37:36.632
You all right?

37:36.715 --> 37:38.342
Yeah.

37:41.053 --> 37:43.347
(clanking inside)

37:55.108 --> 37:58.195
Oh, Murray. Am I glad to see you!

37:58.320 --> 38:00.364
Oh!

38:01.532 --> 38:04.868
- Where are your friends?
- I'm not sure.

38:04.993 --> 38:09.790
- Sergeant, any sign of the targets?
- Negative, sir.

38:09.873 --> 38:13.377
- They just disappeared?
- They're aliens, right?

38:13.460 --> 38:16.338
I have more evidence. Look.

38:17.548 --> 38:20.092
- What's that?
- A mobile computing device.

38:20.175 --> 38:24.721
I snuck it out of Tanner's bag.
It has multiple functions, see?

38:28.225 --> 38:30.352
Uh-oh.

38:30.477 --> 38:33.355
- What?
- Guys, we better get out of here.

38:33.438 --> 38:36.191
This thing is countin' down!

38:38.485 --> 38:40.696
(O'Neill) Clear the area!

38:57.462 --> 38:59.673
Well?

38:59.798 --> 39:05.304
That's weird. I'm sure this is a countdown
for some sort of detonation.

39:46.136 --> 39:48.514
Exactly! This is just like I remember.

39:52.434 --> 39:55.270
Chevron seven is locked.

40:01.401 --> 40:06.031
- He was right. It's an active gate.
- Sending the MALP through.

40:18.669 --> 40:23.549
I remember everything now.
There was no malfunction.

40:24.299 --> 40:26.426
What are you talkin' about?

40:26.510 --> 40:31.807
When we abandoned the ship, we did it
deliberately. We were losing the war.

40:33.100 --> 40:35.477
We're deserters.

40:36.019 --> 40:38.981
After a while I realised
what we'd done wrong.

40:39.064 --> 40:42.484
I wanted to go home,
but the others were afraid.

40:42.985 --> 40:45.362
So they gave you the drugs.

40:46.738 --> 40:52.411
They're not... bad guys.
They're just hiding.

(Carter) Receiving MALP telemetry.

41:05.340 --> 41:08.844
You're gonna...
hunt them down, aren't you?

41:10.345 --> 41:14.725
- Not me.
- But the military, the government?

41:15.851 --> 41:18.854
I don't think anyone's gonna find 'em.

41:21.481 --> 41:24.902
- General Hammond says you're a go.
- Really?

41:24.985 --> 41:28.572
Yeah. It's safe, but, uh...
you're not gonna like it.

42:15.035 --> 42:17.579
They were right.

42:19.456 --> 42:22.626
If we'd gone back, we'd be dead now.

42:26.755 --> 42:30.592
- I'm sorry, Martin.
- So now what?

42:34.137 --> 42:36.515
We go home.

42:48.986 --> 42:51.363
