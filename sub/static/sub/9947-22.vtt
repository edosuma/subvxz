00:03.700 --> 00:05.500
Anyone thinking we know fuck all
about owt,

00:05.501 --> 00:07.500
needs to watch their back.

00:07.501 --> 00:09.499
So you've had your Labour,
reclassifying skunk,

00:09.500 --> 00:11.299
sending prices sky-high,

00:11.300 --> 00:15.818
literally, literally
taking the grass from its own roots!

00:15.820 --> 00:18.059
Now you've got your ConDemNation,

00:18.060 --> 00:21.419
Liberals noshing Tories
like altar boys picking dimps up!

00:21.420 --> 00:23.779
Have we had
a national fucking stroke...

00:23.780 --> 00:25.220
or what?!

00:25.221 --> 00:27.899
Is revolution a word...

00:27.900 --> 00:29.539
or was it never?

00:29.540 --> 00:31.659
Anybody watching needs to know,

00:31.660 --> 00:35.059
we cope better than average
with irony in Chatsworth.

00:35.060 --> 00:36.300
Well, for fuck's sake,

00:36.301 --> 00:37.899
we live in Manchester,

00:37.900 --> 00:41.179
and they charge us for water!

00:41.180 --> 00:44.179
I wandered lonely as a clown,

00:44.180 --> 00:45.940
necking mushrooms rarely found.

00:45.941 --> 00:48.419
This green and pleasant land

00:48.420 --> 00:50.259
in ancient times...

00:50.260 --> 00:52.259
yak yak yak yak yak yak yak yak yak!

00:52.260 --> 00:54.340
It's not theirs any more.

00:55.700 --> 00:59.139
This is our England now.

00:59.140 --> 01:00.260
Partaaaay!

01:05.740 --> 01:08.220
'Get a few quid, shag a few birds,
decent clobber,

01:08.221 --> 01:10.339
'smart motor. What then?

01:10.340 --> 01:14.339
'25% of lads aged 18-26

'And 50% of 16-year-olds

'For what?

01:19.060 --> 01:21.458

There, son, go on.

Go on, son. Ta!

Kelly Maguire.

02:11.060 --> 02:12.579
Said I'll be there in five.

02:12.580 --> 02:16.419
Tell me what you're wearing.
Sick! Where are you rubbing it?

02:16.420 --> 02:19.019
Go on, girl! Turn it to the highest,
let me hear you.

02:19.020 --> 02:20.100
You're getting me at it now.

02:20.101 --> 02:22.179
He's got my bag! He's got my bag!

02:22.180 --> 02:23.540
He's got my bag!

02:25.340 --> 02:27.259
Push it all the way up.

02:27.260 --> 02:30.499
I bet it's nice! Now pinch
your nipples and shout my name.

02:30.500 --> 02:32.779
Hope it's not your mum
or sister next.

02:32.780 --> 02:34.660
Yeah, they wouldn't be out
on their own!

02:34.661 --> 02:38.300
No nothing. I'm coming.
Not in my pants! Just wait there.

02:39.900 --> 02:40.940
Arrggh! Help!

02:42.500 --> 02:44.659
Will somebody give me a hand?

02:44.660 --> 02:47.219
I'm a policeman!
Look, somebody give me hand!

02:47.220 --> 02:48.458
Help!

02:48.459 --> 02:49.420
Someone help!

02:51.580 --> 02:53.539
Yeah, ambulance.

02:53.540 --> 02:56.619
His leg's impaled on a fence.
Look, will someone give us a hand?

02:56.620 --> 02:58.339
PHONE RINGS

02:58.340 --> 02:59.820
Don't get involved, mate.

02:59.821 --> 03:01.180
Gallagher!

03:04.940 --> 03:06.620
Yeah, I'm almost there.

03:10.940 --> 03:13.859
"With love and respect
for the woman I worship,

03:13.860 --> 03:15.979
"and whose family
I'm privileged to enter.

03:15.980 --> 03:20.059
"I pledge to guide
her beautiful child..."

03:20.060 --> 03:21.980
Maybe doing our own vows
is a bad idea?

03:21.981 --> 03:24.579
Mimi's keen you stamp your own style
on this wedding.

03:24.580 --> 03:26.180
She'll do a good job with hers.

03:26.181 --> 03:28.379
The lads'll think
I'm taking the piss.

03:28.380 --> 03:31.739
So focus more on your love for Mimi.

03:31.740 --> 03:32.860
But, bottom line,

03:32.861 --> 03:35.779
you are going to be
their step-father.

03:35.780 --> 03:36.979
Mam?

03:36.980 --> 03:38.060
She's in the Jockey.

03:38.061 --> 03:40.579
Just had to give Scouse Macka a slap.
Spreading lies.

03:40.580 --> 03:44.099
Said that Dalglish and Souness
spit-roasted the night

03:44.100 --> 03:46.699
them tramps won the European Cup!
She hates Jocks.

03:46.700 --> 03:48.259
Maybe that's why.

03:48.260 --> 03:48.938
What yous up to?

03:48.939 --> 03:50.220
Private tuition.

03:50.221 --> 03:52.259
Thought you got maths?

03:52.260 --> 03:53.300
Everyone can improve.

03:53.301 --> 03:56.539
It's so I can help out with
invoices, spreadsheets.

03:56.540 --> 03:57.378
Duh! We don't keep paper trails.

03:57.379 --> 03:58.778
The Jockey has to.

03:58.779 --> 04:00.220
Tax returns.

04:00.221 --> 04:02.060
Karen does all that.

04:05.900 --> 04:07.499
"I promise to love,

04:07.500 --> 04:09.019
"cherish

04:09.020 --> 04:11.099

04:12.500 --> 04:14.020
"Michael and Cilla."

04:22.780 --> 04:25.740
"I was the sad song
you made better...

04:27.780 --> 04:29.780
"..said don't be afraid
of the dark..."

04:31.740 --> 04:33.499
Fucking knew it!

04:33.500 --> 04:35.539
Mam and that granny-shagger!

04:35.540 --> 04:36.660
Et tu, Rooney!

04:38.140 --> 04:39.899
He's got a name.

04:39.900 --> 04:41.579
Yeah?

04:41.580 --> 04:43.699
What's the opposite of paedophile?

04:43.700 --> 04:44.740
Paedophobe.

04:47.740 --> 04:48.898
I'm sorry, Mimi.

04:48.899 --> 04:50.620
Someone going to tell us
what's going on?

04:50.621 --> 04:55.019
I wanted a more fitting occasion
for the announcement.

04:55.020 --> 04:58.540
But I suppose the more time to get
your head round it is no bad thing.

05:00.140 --> 05:02.620
Billy Tutton is doing me the honour
of making me his wife.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.180
Who's Billy Tutton?

05:10.700 --> 05:11.980
No congratulations?

05:13.860 --> 05:16.699
A match made
in Jeremy Kyle ratings heaven!

05:16.700 --> 05:19.259
May you have a gilf-edged future!

05:19.260 --> 05:23.020
No three cheers
for the happy couple?

05:24.300 --> 05:27.059
Bet a round of drinks on the house
will break the ice.

05:27.060 --> 05:29.379
On me.

05:29.380 --> 05:30.340
CHEERING

05:45.140 --> 05:46.260
I didn't get rid of it.

05:46.261 --> 05:48.139
So lay off the vodka!

05:48.140 --> 05:50.819
I swore I'd never be a single mum.

05:50.820 --> 05:53.260
You don't know what he'll say.
Shane loves kids.

05:53.261 --> 05:54.979
It's got nothing to do with him.

05:54.980 --> 05:55.620
How can it not?

05:55.621 --> 05:58.739
He's always trying to be nice.
Makes my skin crawl.

05:58.740 --> 06:00.020
Bit harsh.

06:00.021 --> 06:05.259
All that natural, earthy shit
used to turn me on.

06:05.260 --> 06:06.860
I was thrilled he was so different.

06:06.861 --> 06:08.739
Now he just stinks.

06:08.740 --> 06:10.900
Your emotions are bound to be
all over the place.

06:10.901 --> 06:13.940
You know when you know.
I've moved on.

06:20.900 --> 06:22.018
I hate this park.

06:22.019 --> 06:23.300
Even with me to protect you?

06:24.540 --> 06:27.379
Where were those shitbags
when they were needed?

06:27.380 --> 06:29.939
Eww! Check PC Plod
shaking his daft head!

06:29.940 --> 06:31.740
Bet you feel safe
with him at night(!)

06:31.741 --> 06:34.619
Carl's ten times the man
you'll ever be!

06:34.620 --> 06:35.898
Carl?

06:35.899 --> 06:37.380
I think he knows.

06:37.381 --> 06:40.979
Takes more than Armani jeans
and a pair of Air Max to be a man.

06:40.980 --> 06:41.778
Eh, Gallagher?

06:41.779 --> 06:42.900
Stand up for yourself!

06:45.140 --> 06:47.739
Do you two wash the filth
off each other in the shower?

06:47.740 --> 06:48.980
Leave it.

06:50.020 --> 06:51.260
D'you know him?

06:51.261 --> 06:53.619
I think so.

06:53.620 --> 06:55.299
Simon...

06:55.300 --> 06:56.699
Wexford?

06:56.700 --> 06:58.339
In our kid's year in school.

06:58.340 --> 06:59.820
Ian? Lip.

07:00.940 --> 07:02.699
Good at football?

07:02.700 --> 07:05.099
Brilliant. City's academy.

07:05.100 --> 07:07.139
Not that good, then.

07:07.140 --> 07:10.779
I vote we choke him on his own
bollocks, slice him like a pizza,

07:10.780 --> 07:14.499
and feed him to the eels
in the Manchester Ship Canal.

07:14.500 --> 07:17.219
Ah! Curious face of
Billy Tutton Button!

07:17.220 --> 07:19.179
I'll get him on his own.

07:19.180 --> 07:20.979
Have a word.

07:20.980 --> 07:22.299
Imagine it's you or him,

07:22.300 --> 07:24.859
dead or alive,
but there can only be one winner.

07:24.860 --> 07:26.419
All right, calm down!

07:26.420 --> 07:29.659
Or, right, he's ripped you off
for fifty grand. Nobheads!

07:29.660 --> 07:31.420
We can't kill him for marrying Mum.

07:31.421 --> 07:32.979
Pussies.

07:32.980 --> 07:34.900
We make the little shit realise
this can't happen.

07:34.901 --> 07:37.499
Send him far away, if necessary.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.019
And what if she follows him?

07:39.020 --> 07:40.058
Then at least we've done our best.

07:40.059 --> 07:41.378
Have you heard yourselves?

07:41.379 --> 07:42.100
Earwigging!

07:42.101 --> 07:45.459
Surprises are nice, but I
don't want you spending too much.

07:45.460 --> 07:49.499
Our love for each other
is everything we need.

07:49.500 --> 07:53.099
D'you reckon, Mimi? A few brothers
and sisters might be nice for Cilla.

07:53.100 --> 07:55.419
We'll have to get a move on.

07:55.420 --> 07:57.660
That's what it's all about, Mimi.

08:00.740 --> 08:03.339
Maybe some day you'll
get a grip of your bird.

08:03.340 --> 08:05.059
Billy!

08:05.060 --> 08:06.180
I need a word.

08:06.181 --> 08:09.380
I can't, mate, sorry. I've got to
go see a man about a horse.

08:21.800 --> 08:24.080
Me and Paddy turned the
tables on the greedy fucks

08:24.081 --> 08:26.359
- Started drinking in
this hotel weeks before,

08:26.360 --> 08:28.480
spent plenty,
got the manager sweet...

08:28.481 --> 08:32.159
Night of the wedding, promised
we'd pay the tab at the end...

08:32.159 --> 08:37.198
free bar, everyone proper drunk.
We just did one ... never went back.

08:37.200 --> 08:38.999
Why don't we do that?

08:39.000 --> 08:41.839
Cameras, too many grasses ...
it's tricky now.

08:41.840 --> 08:45.639
I hope I make you
as happy as Paddy did.

08:45.640 --> 08:47.160
Oh, of course you do...

08:48.200 --> 08:50.320
and then some, handsome.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.200
Did you bait many badgers,
Daisy Crockett?

08:59.201 --> 09:03.119
Lovely. Keep us cosy this winter.

09:03.120 --> 09:04.880
Make a nice hat and mittens them.

09:04.881 --> 09:06.599
You all right in there?

09:06.600 --> 09:08.159
It's easier to concentrate.

09:08.160 --> 09:10.680
Did you ask Chesney
about the food?

09:16.320 --> 09:18.080
What?

09:22.240 --> 09:25.359
You know Jamie won't
let this happen don't you?

09:25.360 --> 09:28.319
And we all have to
follow our leader.

09:28.320 --> 09:30.360
I can't do dead things any more.

09:41.840 --> 09:43.400
I thought we were doing all right.

09:43.401 --> 09:46.160
I'm sorry, Shane.

09:49.160 --> 09:50.318
I can't be with you.

09:50.319 --> 09:52.200
After everything we've been through?

09:52.201 --> 09:56.759
Years of ups, downs,
spinning round and fucking round...?

09:56.760 --> 09:59.839
What's so big that
we can't deal with it now?

09:59.840 --> 10:03.439
It's not about
the big stuff any more.

10:03.440 --> 10:05.520
Is it that bald fucker?

10:07.520 --> 10:11.759
Slag. Wanker, wanker!

10:11.760 --> 10:14.119
Come on! I can do that.

10:14.120 --> 10:16.160
Bad taste, Shane.

10:19.680 --> 10:21.160
Are you going to him?

10:21.161 --> 10:24.119
I'm going to no-one.

10:24.120 --> 10:26.280
There is no-one.

10:28.440 --> 10:29.480
Then what?

10:30.680 --> 10:33.999
The fact that there almost was...

10:34.000 --> 10:36.600
means you can't be the one any more.

10:45.680 --> 10:48.199
I promise.

10:48.200 --> 10:50.040
I promise I will make this better.

10:50.041 --> 10:53.719
Don't...

10:53.720 --> 10:56.599
No more hunting, if that helps.

10:56.600 --> 10:58.799
Kel, I swear to God. Watch me.

10:58.800 --> 11:00.198
Now that I know how you feel...

11:00.199 --> 11:01.198
You don't know how I feel.

11:01.199 --> 11:02.600
Yes! Yes I do.

11:04.640 --> 11:10.080
Kelly, I swear I'll fix us.

11:12.280 --> 11:15.920
Give me one more chance to show you.
That's all I need.

11:20.360 --> 11:22.120
I'll show you...

11:25.040 --> 11:28.799
Three Rolexes, two Tags, a Panerai
and a bird's Cartier. Suit Karen.

11:28.800 --> 11:32.799
These things are worth
a third without their papers.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.359
Not these. Phil Fingerarse said
he'll take the lot at 40%.

11:35.360 --> 11:39.239
Bit of a coincidence Baghead Billy's
just back from Bangkok.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.119
These are real, dickhead.
The ram raids were on the news.

11:42.120 --> 11:43.840
You couldn't raid a biscuit tin.

11:43.841 --> 11:45.279
Not me!

11:45.280 --> 11:46.720
(WHISTLE)

11:52.760 --> 11:53.880
What you doing here?

11:53.881 --> 11:56.000
Any chance of a chat...?

11:57.680 --> 11:59.480
Don't I know you from somewhere?

12:06.080 --> 12:07.040
Am I in trouble?

12:10.200 --> 12:11.000
Still playing football?

12:11.001 --> 12:14.799
Bit of five-a-side. You?

12:14.800 --> 12:16.520
Got a game with
the national police team.

12:16.521 --> 12:19.399
Wouldn't thought you'd make it.

12:19.400 --> 12:22.239
Went for different kinds
of trials instead.

12:22.240 --> 12:25.079
I know I should have done
something... in the park.

12:25.080 --> 12:26.879
Don't worry about it.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.919
Official policy is
discourage have-a-go-heroes.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.878
Gives us more paperwork
if a robbery becomes a murder.

12:31.879 --> 12:33.798
Like you said,
that could've been my mam.

12:33.799 --> 12:35.200
Should have left him stuck there.

12:35.201 --> 12:38.279
Yeah, well... he'll never
be a father, but he's alive.

12:38.280 --> 12:43.319
I never forget a bizzie's kipper.
Crown court two years ago.

12:43.320 --> 12:45.560
You put Vinny the Red
away for five years.

12:45.561 --> 12:48.199
And I'm sure you and Paddy
looked after his family.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.839
Only right,
seeing as he kept his mouth shut...

12:50.840 --> 12:54.119
Buzzing you asked, mate.
Just... you know...

12:54.120 --> 12:57.319
Soon as I get the cartilage fixed,
I'll definitely give you a call.

12:57.320 --> 12:59.360
Be good to play
for a proper team again...

13:14.280 --> 13:15.680
He's pressing charges.

13:15.681 --> 13:17.279
For what?

13:17.280 --> 13:20.039
Said I pulled his
leg down on the spike. Deliberately.

13:20.040 --> 13:21.878
It's now my fault
he can't have kids.

13:21.879 --> 13:23.038
Bollocks.

13:23.039 --> 13:25.360
Agreed. But if this goes
the wrong way, I could go to jail.

13:25.361 --> 13:26.999
On some smackhead's say-so?

13:27.000 --> 13:29.439
I've had something similar before.

13:29.440 --> 13:34.720
I know it's hardly second nature,
but I could do with a witness.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.879
Or are you going to turn away again?

13:38.880 --> 13:41.199
I don't think you understand.

13:41.200 --> 13:45.080
You know what? I really do.

13:52.720 --> 13:56.880
You having a laugh?
Gonna play football with a dibble?

14:03.240 --> 14:05.439
Need a lift?

14:05.440 --> 14:06.840
I'm not going far.

14:06.841 --> 14:08.759
It's all right, Billy, get in.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.680
I've got to go and see the florist.

14:15.320 --> 14:17.280
I've got a few knock-off dresses...

14:17.281 --> 14:21.239
need you to pick one for Mimi ...
it'll just take a minute...

14:21.240 --> 14:22.480
Maybe later, mate.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.600
Grab him!

14:34.000 --> 14:38.079
Fuck's sake!
What's up with you?!

14:38.080 --> 14:39.358
Sorry.

14:39.359 --> 14:40.320
You OK?

14:42.160 --> 14:43.120
Get in.

14:54.800 --> 14:56.000
Hang on, Tony!

14:56.001 --> 14:57.800
Fucking hell...

14:59.600 --> 15:03.440
Right. Get in here and bend over,
you worthless piece of shi...

15:05.600 --> 15:07.600
Tony doesn't mind.

15:09.680 --> 15:11.800
Won't be long.

15:14.520 --> 15:17.559
Bit kinky. Much demand?

15:17.560 --> 15:18.560
You've no idea.

15:20.200 --> 15:22.919
I just almost ran our Shane over.

15:22.920 --> 15:24.839
He's in bits.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.919
Feel guilty about fucking
your mum's relationship

15:27.920 --> 15:29.919
so you want to fix your brother's?

15:29.920 --> 15:33.879
I don't need some headcase going
under when we're out grafting.

15:33.880 --> 15:37.039
Again, all about you.
The law according to Jamie Maguire.

15:37.040 --> 15:39.279
It's not just about me

15:39.280 --> 15:43.320
if some ex-smackhead brass
is taking the piss out of my family.

15:47.520 --> 15:49.160
Please leave.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.360
Tell me I'm wrong.

15:58.800 --> 15:59.760
Does he know?

16:03.920 --> 16:06.400
Did it get a bit messy
with some punter?

16:09.080 --> 16:10.200
Are you keeping it?

16:14.920 --> 16:17.399
No wonder you want out.

16:17.400 --> 16:19.319
It was over long before this.

16:19.320 --> 16:22.079
Yeah, well, he thinks
you're giving it another go.

16:22.080 --> 16:25.239
Yeah? If we do,
it's because we want to.

16:25.240 --> 16:26.560
KNOCKING ON DOOR

16:26.561 --> 16:28.319
When will you learn?

16:28.320 --> 16:31.559
You can't make the world
fit into the box you want.

16:31.560 --> 16:33.999
And every time you force it,

16:34.000 --> 16:38.240
it keeps straining to spring back
into the shape it was meant to be.

16:45.600 --> 16:48.280
Try not to hurt him too much.

17:00.400 --> 17:02.679
850, 9,

17:02.680 --> 17:05.279
950, two grand.

17:05.280 --> 17:09.878
Now add that to what he's
already give you.

17:09.880 --> 17:12.040
Making me give in
and let Billy think I'm a pushover?

17:12.040 --> 17:14.319
He thinks he did good, though.

17:14.319 --> 17:15.078
Three?

17:15.079 --> 17:16.160
Five.

17:16.161 --> 17:17.919
Three and a half?

17:17.920 --> 17:20.440
You can't kid a kidder.
Four and a half.

17:23.040 --> 17:25.440
My last offer... four grand.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.999
I'm grateful, Ches.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.558
I got my reputation to think of.

17:34.559 --> 17:35.918
He's just trying to prove himself.

17:35.919 --> 17:37.998
Jackson said he was
a trier at school.

17:37.999 --> 17:39.840
That's what we called
the divvies in woodwork.

17:39.841 --> 17:42.159
Don't be so sensitive, Mimi.

17:42.160 --> 17:44.279
He didn't even get that.

17:44.280 --> 17:47.519
Don't think I haven't noticed all
the sniggering behind our backs.

17:47.520 --> 17:48.920
You're being paranoid.

17:48.921 --> 17:51.639
Yeah? Hardly been inundated
with offers to help, have we?

17:51.640 --> 17:53.120
I helped with your vows.

17:53.121 --> 17:57.279
Whit-whoo(!) Nobody's actually
said they're pleased for us.

17:57.280 --> 17:58.960
To be honest...

18:01.840 --> 18:05.840
A few of us aren't sure
you're doing the right thing.

18:07.600 --> 18:10.559
Mimi always knows her own mind.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.079
Too right, Ches.

18:12.080 --> 18:14.839
We'll see how dubious everyone is

18:14.840 --> 18:18.079
when they're necking
free champagne all night.

18:18.080 --> 18:20.119
All night...?!

18:20.120 --> 18:22.479
That dibble deserves all he gets.

18:22.480 --> 18:27.159
Think they can go round
slapping who they like...

18:27.160 --> 18:28.318
Is that our Daz?

18:28.319 --> 18:29.600
Give us your phone, you dick.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.200
Daz!

18:33.960 --> 18:35.839
How much? I'll buy it off you!

18:35.840 --> 18:37.839
Daz!

18:37.840 --> 18:40.759
Daz!

18:40.760 --> 18:42.318
He'll get fuck all
in Cash for Stash, him.

18:42.319 --> 18:43.520
You all right?

18:45.400 --> 18:47.440
How about that for gratitude(?)

18:50.800 --> 18:54.639
Is there a price on the '45 Phantom
convertible without a chauffeur...?

18:54.640 --> 18:55.960
Let's go.

18:57.360 --> 18:59.600
What's the postcode
got to do with it?

18:59.601 --> 19:03.279
Yeah? Why don't you stick your
shit car up your arse, you prick?

19:03.280 --> 19:04.640
That's the spirit.

19:08.200 --> 19:09.960
Now, about that chat.

19:15.880 --> 19:18.959
Piss-taking over, sunshine.

19:18.960 --> 19:22.199
Pack whatever possessions you've
accumulated in your tender years

19:22.200 --> 19:24.278
and fuck off as far away
from our mum as you can.

19:24.279 --> 19:25.278
What about Mimi?

19:25.279 --> 19:26.760
What about her?

19:26.761 --> 19:28.719
She's recovered from worse

19:28.720 --> 19:30.398
than some spotty little scrote
doing a midnight flit.

19:30.399 --> 19:31.480
That's right.

19:31.481 --> 19:34.079
You get in touch and tell her
you had second thoughts...

19:34.080 --> 19:36.480
you've changed your mind,
it wasn't meant to be...

19:36.481 --> 19:38.199
make up whatever you want...

19:38.200 --> 19:41.279
but if I ever see you
around here again...

19:41.280 --> 19:44.080
I'll let this pit bull
get medieval on your arse.

19:49.640 --> 19:51.599
At least it's working.

19:51.600 --> 19:54.119
It's mint.
Might get one on my next upgrade.

19:54.120 --> 19:55.840
Thought you just got a new phone?

19:55.841 --> 20:00.879
30 quid. They're 150 in the shop ...
contract only.

20:00.880 --> 20:01.959
Who off?

20:01.960 --> 20:02.640
Daz Mitchell.

20:02.641 --> 20:05.159
You shouldn't even know him.

20:05.160 --> 20:08.039
It's all right for you to
shag his sister, though?!

20:08.040 --> 20:10.119
And a lovely girl she is, too.

20:10.120 --> 20:10.920
Hypocrite.

20:13.080 --> 20:15.759
Where's he even getting 30 quid?

20:15.760 --> 20:17.240
You should be
praising his initiative.

20:17.241 --> 20:19.239
Should be on a curfew.

20:19.240 --> 20:21.519
That's right. 24/7. Thought Police.

20:21.520 --> 20:24.839
Tight rein does them
no favours round here.

20:24.840 --> 20:27.000
Just enough slack
to stretch to Strangeways...?

20:27.001 --> 20:30.879
Social worker in the area... Is your
new mate getting under your skin?

20:30.880 --> 20:31.600
Behave.

20:31.601 --> 20:35.679
No, no ... careful Carl. Y'know,
enemy within. Cameron's Stasi...

20:35.680 --> 20:37.319
You should lay off the weed.

20:37.320 --> 20:38.678
It's got nothing to...

20:38.679 --> 20:39.600
THUMPING MUSIC IN EARPHONES

20:39.601 --> 20:42.559
INAUDIBLE

20:42.560 --> 20:44.399
Go on.

20:44.400 --> 20:45.720
It will pass, you know.

20:45.721 --> 20:47.239
What will?

20:47.240 --> 20:48.678
Thinking you're better.

20:48.679 --> 20:49.760
I'm going for a run.

20:49.761 --> 20:54.199
You not think there was plenty of
times I'd had enough of the gaff?

20:54.200 --> 20:57.559
I was a young man once,
sick of this place.

20:57.560 --> 21:01.479
But we ... Gallaghers ...
thrive in this environment.

21:01.480 --> 21:04.959
Darwinian. We're naturals when
it comes to playing the game.

21:04.960 --> 21:06.319
Their game...

21:06.320 --> 21:08.879
So how come everyone
else got off? Fiona, Lip...?

21:08.880 --> 21:14.239
Monica's snide little genes blagged
it to the front with them.

21:14.240 --> 21:18.839
Truth be told, they're not
made for it the same way.

21:18.840 --> 21:22.919
You and me... peas in a pod.

21:22.920 --> 21:26.799
Like your new bird said ... there's
more of me in you than the others.

21:26.800 --> 21:30.079
You're even better than I ever was.

21:30.080 --> 21:33.919
Running errands for Jamie,
plenty of readies.

21:33.920 --> 21:36.720
You're a proper success story.

21:38.480 --> 21:40.880
You can run but you can't hide.

21:54.080 --> 21:55.559
SHOUTING

21:55.560 --> 21:57.279
Someone help!

21:57.280 --> 21:58.360
Gallagher.

21:58.361 --> 22:01.519
Someone give me a hand! Someone!

22:01.520 --> 22:03.240
Gallagher!

22:14.320 --> 22:17.399
Been a while since we last
ate as a family.

22:17.400 --> 22:21.039
Sardine butties and Greggs'
custard slices for Cilla's birthday.

22:21.040 --> 22:24.919
A proper meal. Conversation.
We still need to clear the air.

22:24.920 --> 22:27.719
And you need some decent
scran inside you.

22:27.720 --> 22:30.199
Nerves, excitement, whatever it is...

22:30.200 --> 22:31.200
AIDS?

22:36.400 --> 22:38.159
Where's Kelly?

22:38.160 --> 22:40.999
Getting rifled off a six ft stud
with an eight inch length?

22:41.000 --> 22:43.359
Stop winding him up!

22:43.360 --> 22:46.519
I don't want him
wasting away before we get hitched.

22:46.520 --> 22:48.120
No one be late.

22:51.920 --> 22:53.479
Has he packed?

22:53.480 --> 22:54.720
Mam's had us too busy.

22:54.721 --> 22:56.879
Be around for her once he's gone.

22:56.880 --> 22:59.119
She's gonna need looking after.

22:59.120 --> 23:00.799
Still say we cut him up...

23:00.800 --> 23:03.399
I used to melt in Monica's eyes...

23:03.400 --> 23:05.120
but these...

23:06.400 --> 23:08.400
It better not turn all to mush.

23:11.160 --> 23:12.679
They'll sort that out.

23:12.680 --> 23:14.319
No wonder I'm mad for Carl.

23:14.320 --> 23:17.159
He obviously learnt his lyrics
from a master craftsman.

23:17.160 --> 23:20.479
Oh, eh up, here he is.

23:20.480 --> 23:21.879
Careful what you say.

23:21.880 --> 23:24.278
Eh, I've got someone to look
after me anyway.

23:24.279 --> 23:25.240
It was for football!

23:25.241 --> 23:26.799
Have you seen this?

23:26.800 --> 23:29.359
Another busy fucker
sticking their nose in.

23:29.360 --> 23:31.840
Some pensioner just naused
a brothel.

23:31.841 --> 23:33.559
It stopped people traffickers.

23:33.560 --> 23:34.520
There were 13-year-old girls
in there!

23:34.521 --> 23:36.319
See!

23:36.320 --> 23:37.759
Priorities... messed up.

23:37.760 --> 23:40.759
Converting to the dark side already.

23:40.760 --> 23:41.878
Don't be stupid!

23:41.879 --> 23:43.320
Got to earn a living somehow.

23:43.321 --> 23:46.079
Jamie. We're late.

23:46.080 --> 23:48.079
So are we.

23:48.080 --> 23:51.640
Don't know what the rush is.
KFC's 24/7.

23:53.640 --> 23:55.239
Cheers, everyone.

23:55.240 --> 23:57.039
Cheers!

23:57.040 --> 23:58.879
TIMER RINGS

23:58.880 --> 24:01.799
Micky, hand.

24:01.800 --> 24:03.360
Why haven't you packed yet?

24:06.320 --> 24:08.680
Can't beat a pan of scouse.

24:17.840 --> 24:19.599
Sprouts, Kell?

24:19.600 --> 24:22.159
Billy's not been eating properly...

24:22.160 --> 24:26.839
laying on the wedding of the year's
taking its toll.

24:26.840 --> 24:27.960
(I love you.)

24:46.720 --> 24:48.799
I don't need it.

24:48.800 --> 24:50.680
Looks like someone's had a few
beers.

24:50.681 --> 24:53.960
If you want to get rid of me,
you'll have to do it your way.

25:04.520 --> 25:06.959
I've got something I need to say.

25:06.960 --> 25:10.679
I know most of you don't want
this to happen.

25:10.680 --> 25:14.760
Nice to see no one's denying it.
Appreciate the honesty.

25:16.760 --> 25:18.999
So, in case anyone gets a bit brave,

25:19.000 --> 25:23.079
"Speak now or forever
hold your peace..."

25:23.080 --> 25:25.560
I'm gonna prove
I know what I'm doing.

25:29.800 --> 25:31.600
What was always my dream?

25:33.040 --> 25:37.199
When you were kids,
where was my dream place to live?

25:37.200 --> 25:38.760
Aigburth?

25:39.960 --> 25:41.160
By the sea.

25:43.200 --> 25:47.600
The final piece in my jigsaw of life.
Keep me happy til the day I die.

26:00.640 --> 26:03.279
Three months ago your father rang me.

26:03.280 --> 26:04.200
Where is he?

26:04.201 --> 26:07.039
Working with some main
players out of Bangkok.

26:07.040 --> 26:09.119
Exporting all over the world.

26:09.120 --> 26:11.639
Hey ... we could visit.

26:11.640 --> 26:13.879
An 'oliday.

26:13.880 --> 26:16.040
You said you've always fancied
Thailand...?

26:16.041 --> 26:18.399
Lovely.

26:18.400 --> 26:22.359
This is his six bedroom house
on the beach. Four staff.

26:22.360 --> 26:24.199
Chauffeur driven Merc.

26:24.200 --> 26:26.959
He asked me to join him.

26:26.960 --> 26:30.279
Told me he'd do anything.
Totally new man ... begged me,

26:30.280 --> 26:32.319
said none of it mattered without me.

26:32.320 --> 26:35.039
Like a lottery win.

26:35.040 --> 26:36.920
Except...

26:38.000 --> 26:41.799
I told him it's not what I wanted.

26:41.800 --> 26:43.040
I don't believe you.

26:45.800 --> 26:48.320
First class. Manchester to Bangkok.

26:52.360 --> 26:55.359
This was before Billy turned up.

26:55.360 --> 26:56.719
That's the point.

26:56.720 --> 27:00.159
If I know that
I don't want that luxury

27:00.160 --> 27:02.399
and comfort for the rest
of my days,

27:02.400 --> 27:07.000
credit me with enough intelligence
to know what I do want now.

27:08.640 --> 27:10.879
We are doing this anyway.

27:10.880 --> 27:12.879
But you're my family.

27:12.880 --> 27:17.999
You're the people I want to spend
the rest of my life among.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.639
Your approval counts more than
I think you know.

27:20.640 --> 27:23.200
It won't be complete without
you behind us.

27:24.640 --> 27:28.960
If you really love me,
please give us your blessing.

27:35.760 --> 27:37.120
Fine.

27:45.040 --> 27:47.239
You'll always be my little star.

27:47.240 --> 27:50.599
Even Cilla couldn't knock
you off that pedestal.

27:50.600 --> 27:52.799
Never feel threatened.

27:52.800 --> 27:56.840
But I'd be the proudest mum in the
world if you'd agree to give me away.

28:01.680 --> 28:02.960
Eh.

28:09.600 --> 28:10.718
To Mimi and Billy...

28:10.719 --> 28:12.200
Mimi and Billy.

28:15.920 --> 28:20.559
(VOICES OUTSIDE) Keep away. Agh!
Get off you dickhead.

28:20.560 --> 28:21.840
Get here, you slag.

28:21.841 --> 28:24.719
I'll smash your head in!

28:24.720 --> 28:26.279
Aagh!

28:26.280 --> 28:27.680
SHOUTING CONTINUES

28:30.320 --> 28:33.119
Leave her alone!

28:33.120 --> 28:35.960
Get in there, you slag,
I'm warning you!

28:43.200 --> 28:47.040
(FRANK'S VOICE) 'We Gallaghers thrive
in this environment. Darwinian.

28:48.840 --> 28:51.040
'You and me... peas in a pod.'

29:02.960 --> 29:04.919
Simon!

29:04.920 --> 29:06.680
Nice timing. You come to console me?

29:06.681 --> 29:08.359
I'll say what I saw.

29:08.360 --> 29:11.679
Once it made the news
they get a bit keen for a scapegoat.

29:11.680 --> 29:13.799
I don't get you.

29:13.800 --> 29:17.119
With my previous ...
suspension's the easy option.

29:17.120 --> 29:18.839
Nothing I can do?

29:18.840 --> 29:20.840
Did it take you this long
to grow a pair?

29:23.080 --> 29:25.560
We are fucked.

29:27.160 --> 29:28.600
He says he's a 34 waist

29:28.601 --> 29:31.680
but I don't reckon he's seen his
bollocks since they dropped.

29:33.680 --> 29:34.960
There you go, "Dad."

29:37.200 --> 29:38.920
Finished?

29:48.400 --> 29:50.558
Got a couple of spares
for the derby on Saturday.

29:50.559 --> 29:51.840
Should batter them.

29:51.841 --> 29:54.119
He still seems wary.

29:54.120 --> 29:55.800
Micky freaking him out won't help.

29:58.040 --> 30:00.119
Fiance's still off his food.

30:00.120 --> 30:02.600
He must have lost a stone
with all this pressure.

30:05.800 --> 30:06.558
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30:06.559 --> 30:07.800
Carl.

30:13.480 --> 30:15.599
No wires?

30:15.600 --> 30:16.839
Behave!

30:16.840 --> 30:18.160
Laters.

30:20.720 --> 30:21.880
Hope you don't mind me asking...

30:21.881 --> 30:22.999
Go on.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.879
My mates'd crumble. Bit young.

30:24.880 --> 30:27.040
I'm not saying you're
old, it's just you've

30:27.041 --> 30:29.199
got a bit more about
you than most people.

30:29.200 --> 30:30.678
What the fuck are you on about?

30:30.679 --> 30:32.400
Will you be my best man?

30:40.680 --> 30:41.918
Least you've got your appetite back.

30:41.919 --> 30:43.040
I'm hungry for you!

30:47.320 --> 30:49.959
We've got a bit of business
to attend to.

30:49.960 --> 30:53.079
Could use another set of hands.
You're family now.

30:53.080 --> 30:55.720
Bit of bonding will do you good.

31:15.920 --> 31:17.278
What's the business?

31:17.279 --> 31:18.038
You are.

31:18.039 --> 31:19.400
No point in hanging round.

31:25.920 --> 31:27.639
Agh! What the fuck's that?

31:27.640 --> 31:30.919
Steds.
Time to exercise those demons.

31:30.920 --> 31:33.679
Mild ones. Stop your whining.

31:33.680 --> 31:35.040
We've only got a week...

31:35.041 --> 31:37.960
Mam won't want you looking like
a crackhead at the wedding.

31:39.600 --> 31:41.960
Ha-ha-ha! Come on, champ.

31:46.360 --> 31:51.999
Hello... Needed to swerve predators
a few million aeons ago?

31:52.000 --> 31:55.079
Hardly. Quick enough to catch a dodo?

31:55.080 --> 31:57.959
What do you think KFC and Nando's
are all about?

31:57.960 --> 31:59.360
Civilisation.

32:00.760 --> 32:02.040
How's he doing?

32:02.041 --> 32:04.480
Who "runs" around here anyway?

32:06.520 --> 32:08.919
Having it a bit
lively from the odd lot, maybe.

32:08.920 --> 32:11.639
I'm looking after myself, proper.

32:11.640 --> 32:13.279
Oh well... Ehh!

32:13.280 --> 32:15.719
Here she is!

32:15.720 --> 32:18.359
About time you two settled down.

32:18.360 --> 32:20.439
Ignoring your texts?

32:20.440 --> 32:21.760
We need to talk properly.

32:21.761 --> 32:23.119
Tonight.

32:23.120 --> 32:24.320
Oh he's here now.

32:26.960 --> 32:28.080
Yeah.

32:30.520 --> 32:31.520
Got it.

32:34.040 --> 32:35.358
Lucky day, Carl.

32:35.359 --> 32:36.478
Collect that for Jamie?

32:36.479 --> 32:38.880
Be the easiest monkey
you've ever earnt.

32:42.160 --> 32:44.119
Tell him I'm passing.

32:44.120 --> 32:46.040
I don't think you've got a choice.

32:46.041 --> 32:48.839
Well, no offence,
that's exactly what I've got.

32:48.840 --> 32:49.999
Oh, aye?

32:50.000 --> 32:51.600
I'll go.

32:55.840 --> 32:59.599
Feel free to stay mates with him if
you want, but I'm calling it a day.

32:59.600 --> 33:02.359
Who you talking to?

33:02.360 --> 33:04.959
Oh, well, As the man said...

33:04.960 --> 33:06.719

33:06.720 --> 33:07.799

CHEERING AND VOICES ON TV.

33:20.040 --> 33:22.599
No way, that can't be his.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.638
No, I'm not having that,
how could you?

33:24.639 --> 33:26.520
Where would you fucking put it?

33:29.680 --> 33:31.599
I'm pregnant.

33:31.600 --> 33:33.679
I'm with child.

33:33.680 --> 33:37.559
Fat fuck. Tell you something,
they shouldn't even have kids.

33:37.560 --> 33:39.679
Somebody else's.

33:39.680 --> 33:41.240
What you say?

33:42.360 --> 33:44.680
I'm going to have a baby. I'm sorry.

33:54.040 --> 33:56.799
Who?

33:56.800 --> 33:58.359
One of your regulars?

33:58.360 --> 34:00.919
Could be a one-off.

34:00.920 --> 34:02.880
Did you forget to take your tablets?

34:02.881 --> 34:05.799
Nothing's hundred percent.

34:05.800 --> 34:09.159
But the pill and a condom,
it makes the chances minute.

34:09.159 --> 34:11.918
So I'll buy a lottery ticket.
See if the luck continues.

34:11.920 --> 34:14.279
It wasn't on purpose!

34:14.280 --> 34:16.119

34:16.120 --> 34:17.880

34:20.560 --> 34:23.159

34:23.159 --> 34:24.518
Somebody else's baby?!

34:24.520 --> 34:27.559
A family.
No one needs to know it's not mine.

34:27.560 --> 34:30.079
Everyone knows you're a jaffa.
They'll slaughter you.

34:30.080 --> 34:31.840
Not if we say there's a new
discovery.

34:31.841 --> 34:33.879
Jesus, Shane!

34:33.880 --> 34:37.478
Call me a slag! Slap me,
make some fucking sense!

34:37.480 --> 34:38.879
We'll know.

34:38.880 --> 34:41.679
Kel, I don't care what anyone says.

34:41.679 --> 34:42.840
I'm losing all respect for you.

34:42.841 --> 34:44.918
Yeah, well you'll find it again.

34:44.920 --> 34:46.279
This can't go on.

34:46.280 --> 34:48.719
I can't go on. Without you.

34:48.719 --> 34:50.438
Yes you can.

35:04.960 --> 35:06.039
Please, Shane.

35:06.040 --> 35:09.199
Don't go there.

35:09.200 --> 35:11.799
