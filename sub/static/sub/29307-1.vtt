30:19.151 --> 30:21.385
- Nah. Nah.
- How was work?

30:22.188 --> 30:24.555
You know.

30:24.557 --> 30:26.523
Same shit, different toilet.

30:29.195 --> 30:31.161
Why you all
dressed up though?

30:31.163 --> 30:35.299
Um, well, I thought about
what you told me earlier.

30:36.202 --> 30:38.168
And I went to look
for some jobs.

30:43.142 --> 30:47.344
Baby, I got this.
You know I was just fucking with you.

30:47.346 --> 30:52.349
Yeah, but I actually really enjoy the idea of
bringing in some extra money to the house.

30:52.351 --> 30:54.451
And you know,
with the baby coming soon...

30:55.387 --> 30:57.221
We can actually
really use it.

30:59.291 --> 31:01.058
You know old man
Johnson said,

31:02.261 --> 31:05.562
if I come up with 200,000,
the pharmacy mine.

31:06.232 --> 31:07.598
Yours?

31:07.600 --> 31:11.368
Yeah. He said
he trying to let it go.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.337
And I don't know how
I'm going to come up with it.

31:14.306 --> 31:16.039
But I know I want that shit

31:17.576 --> 31:18.642
So.

31:19.245 --> 31:20.878
200,000.

31:22.014 --> 31:23.580
And the pharmacy is yours.

31:24.617 --> 31:25.883
For real.

31:26.886 --> 31:27.951
Ours.

31:27.953 --> 31:29.586
- Yeah.
- Ours.

31:29.588 --> 31:31.221
Yeah and I figured,

31:31.223 --> 31:34.224
Since we been doing all
this healthy eating shit,

31:34.226 --> 31:36.226
we can kind of
introduce it to the business.

31:37.529 --> 31:39.162
That's a good idea.

31:39.164 --> 31:40.664
Baby, I'm saying,

31:40.666 --> 31:44.902
people coming in and out
everyday picking up their meds,

31:44.904 --> 31:46.670
and they ain't
getting no better.

31:47.406 --> 31:48.672
We can give them
a way out.

31:48.674 --> 31:50.540
Like take the holistic route.

31:50.542 --> 31:52.342
In the pharmacy?

31:52.344 --> 31:56.413
Yeah, we can introduce
them to some herbals.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.181
Help them with their situation.

31:58.183 --> 32:00.150
Get em off that
synthetic shit.

32:01.287 --> 32:03.253
Just like what
we eating right now.

32:03.255 --> 32:04.488
You see zucchini.

32:05.157 --> 32:07.291
But I see vitamin A.

32:07.293 --> 32:13.397
And vitamin A can prevent a whole lot
of shit that these "doctors" can't cure.

32:14.533 --> 32:16.500
How do you know
all this shit?

32:18.470 --> 32:19.536
'Cause I'm smart.

32:19.538 --> 32:22.205
Mm-hmm.
You are very smart.

32:22.207 --> 32:24.374
Smart enough
to have you.

32:24.376 --> 32:26.443
You ready for that dessert?

32:26.445 --> 32:29.379
Dessert. I'm ready
for my dessert right now.

32:29.381 --> 32:30.447
Me too.

32:32.618 --> 32:35.552
Don't sit back down.
Nah, don't sit back down.

32:35.554 --> 32:37.120
This is over here.

32:40.125 --> 32:43.460
I'm telling you, girl,
I'm having dessert uncooked.

32:45.965 --> 32:47.197
Yes, yes.

33:07.720 --> 33:09.586
Hey man,
you trying to get shot?

33:09.588 --> 33:11.722
Nah, man.
What's happening bruh?

33:11.724 --> 33:13.223
Not shit, man.

33:13.225 --> 33:14.291
What's up?

33:14.293 --> 33:17.060
Alright,
this the move.

33:17.062 --> 33:20.030
Big Man, he got some shit
coming in real soon.

33:20.032 --> 33:22.399
From this Latino nigga
name Poppy.

33:22.401 --> 33:24.201
Poppy? I know Poppy?

33:24.203 --> 33:25.402
He ain't shit
to play with, though.

33:25.704 --> 33:28.005
Hell, nah.

33:28.007 --> 33:32.275
I saw him and his shooter
today at the club.

33:32.277 --> 33:35.512
Them niggas
look dumb crazy.

33:35.514 --> 33:37.014
So how are we
going to play this?

33:38.384 --> 33:41.084
Alright, see,
this the move.

33:41.086 --> 33:46.023
Me and Big Man supposed to be cool so
he ain't gone' know I'm coming for him.

33:46.025 --> 33:47.491
But what I need
you to do

33:47.493 --> 33:52.062
is your detective shit,
get the work up off of him.

33:52.064 --> 33:55.265
You know how you cop ass niggas
do, give them two options.

33:56.301 --> 33:58.035
Go to jail or go home.

33:58.037 --> 33:59.569
You already
know the play.

34:01.040 --> 34:02.472
Alright.

34:02.474 --> 34:03.573
Fifty-fifty split?

34:05.644 --> 34:09.780
Nigga naw. I'm doing all the work.
Seventy-thirty.

34:11.116 --> 34:12.581
But you can't hit
a lick without me.

34:13.185 --> 34:14.251
Sixty-forty.

34:16.088 --> 34:17.454
Sixty-forty.

34:20.525 --> 34:22.059
Sixty-forty?

34:23.062 --> 34:25.328
I guess man.

34:25.330 --> 34:27.097
Alright, I'mma be
waiting on the word.

34:28.833 --> 34:30.100
Bet.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.373
What are you doing?

34:39.178 --> 34:40.243

34:40.245 --> 34:41.962

34:41.963 --> 34:43.679
- I'll be right back.
- Where are you going so late?

34:46.452 --> 34:48.217
I gotta go
holla at YaYo.

34:48.821 --> 34:50.853
Your cousin YaYo?

34:50.856 --> 34:52.856
I thought you told me that
he was nothing but trouble.

34:52.858 --> 34:55.358
Nope

34:56.395 --> 34:57.761
I said,

34:58.764 --> 35:00.263
he be in trouble.

35:00.766 --> 35:02.232
It's a big difference.

35:03.602 --> 35:06.636
Just finna go over granny old
house and catch up with him.

35:06.638 --> 35:08.338
I ain't seen him
since we were kids.

35:19.118 --> 35:21.384
Trust me, I'll be
right back, baby.

35:23.122 --> 35:25.188
Ques, you need
to be careful, okay?

35:26.125 --> 35:29.159
- I will.
- We need you.

35:29.161 --> 35:32.729
Baby, get you
some rest.

35:32.731 --> 35:34.264
I'll be fine.
Be right back.

35:44.209 --> 35:46.276
Looks like somebody
running late.

35:46.278 --> 35:49.279
I am running late and you
will not make me even later.

35:49.281 --> 35:50.914
Me make you
even later?

35:50.916 --> 35:52.182
Anyway.

35:53.785 --> 35:56.520
You know I was at your
brother's job today, right?

35:56.522 --> 35:57.854
They got me
running scripts.

35:58.557 --> 36:00.157
You mean to tell me

36:00.626 --> 36:02.626
they got you chasing

36:02.628 --> 36:03.894
fake prescriptions?

36:03.896 --> 36:06.463
Yeah, not the police work
I thought I'd be doing.

36:07.232 --> 36:08.565
Oh, wow.

36:08.567 --> 36:11.268
So you always
wanted to be 12?

36:11.270 --> 36:13.370
Oh, man I come
from a long line of cops.

36:13.372 --> 36:14.571
My pops was a cop.

36:14.573 --> 36:16.239
His pops was a cop.

36:16.241 --> 36:18.475
And his pops was one of
the first black officers.

36:18.477 --> 36:20.510
I'm like fourth generation
police officers.

36:21.747 --> 36:23.813
Wow. I didn't know that.

36:24.349 --> 36:25.415
See me,

36:25.417 --> 36:27.317
I never wanted
to be a cop.

36:27.319 --> 36:29.553
Let alone be
in love with one.

36:30.756 --> 36:33.290
Being a cop used
to mean something.

36:33.292 --> 36:35.358
You can make a difference
in your community.

36:35.360 --> 36:37.761
But now, all we got is all
these senseless killings.

36:37.763 --> 36:39.396
I mean,
it don't feel right.

36:39.398 --> 36:41.965
Not like it was
when we first started.

36:41.967 --> 36:45.635
The only way to make a change is
from the inside, got it? The inside.

36:45.637 --> 36:47.871
That's why I joined
the police officers.

36:47.873 --> 36:49.506
Okay? That's why
I became a cop.

36:49.508 --> 36:51.341
Yeah, but chasing
all these little guys.

36:51.810 --> 36:53.577
I want the big catch.

36:53.579 --> 36:54.644
The trophy.

36:55.647 --> 36:57.914
Okay, well,
I am your trophy.

36:57.916 --> 37:00.417
And I'll catch
you later.

37:02.654 --> 37:04.554
Matter of fact,
I'm going to catch me a nap.

37:12.264 --> 37:14.097
Shit, cuzz.

37:14.098 --> 37:15.931
I'm surprised it took y'all
this long to get started, man.

37:16.335 --> 37:17.567
Shit

37:17.569 --> 37:19.536
Even more
reason to get ready.

37:19.538 --> 37:21.705
I got mouths to feed

37:21.707 --> 37:24.708
Fuck you doing with some scripts
anyway, nigga? I thought you sold dope.

37:25.277 --> 37:26.843
Shit, I did man.

37:26.845 --> 37:29.479
Till a nigga finessed me
with these dummy bricks.

37:29.481 --> 37:31.448
Now a nigga
just maintaining.

37:31.450 --> 37:34.251
Trying to keep my head
above water, man.

37:34.253 --> 37:36.419
Shit but all I need is
a good connect, though.

37:39.391 --> 37:41.692
Cuzz.

37:41.693 --> 37:43.994
I can't risk my shit right now.
Not with all I got going on.

37:43.996 --> 37:47.664
Shit you said Mr. Johnson don't
never be in that mother fucker.

37:47.666 --> 37:50.634
You can just got damn swipe some
of the shit, make some money.

37:50.636 --> 37:53.336
Shit we can get
that 200,000.

37:53.338 --> 37:55.372
- You got a point right there now.
- Yeah.

37:55.374 --> 37:57.440
Man, I got some
niggas in Texas.

37:57.442 --> 37:59.476
We can juug that lean shit
to them all day.

38:00.746 --> 38:01.811
Cuzz, look at me.

38:03.348 --> 38:04.948
If anything go wrong,

38:07.653 --> 38:09.286
Nigga, what can go wrong?

38:09.288 --> 38:10.654
This the perfect juug.

38:11.957 --> 38:13.490
Alright,
I'll let you know.

38:13.925 --> 38:15.358
Yeah, for sure.

39:16.955 --> 39:18.788
It's going down tonight.

39:18.790 --> 39:19.856
You seen them bags?

39:21.960 --> 39:23.893
That was the work

39:23.895 --> 39:25.762
This nigga just brought
Big Man the work.

39:26.398 --> 39:27.597
Yeah, man.

39:28.867 --> 39:30.467

39:30.469 --> 39:31.801
<i>It's going down tonight.</i>

Step out the car.

40:21.153 --> 40:22.585
You're under arrest.

40:24.122 --> 40:25.188
Get your ass

Come with me.

40:30.929 --> 40:32.762
You thought you

40:34.699 --> 40:36.032
Get in the vehicle.
Watch your head.

Cuzz.

45:59.390 --> 46:02.225
I know you ain't trying
to get in Big Man shit.

46:03.128 --> 46:05.512
Shit, why not?

46:05.513 --> 46:07.897

47:30.315 --> 47:33.349
Where are we supposed

47:54.939 --> 47:56.272
I'll let you

48:06.985 --> 48:08.384
Hey, Lisa.

48:47.992 --> 48:49.525
Yeah, I know.

48:49.527 --> 48:52.194
I was there when
they booked him.

48:52.196 --> 48:54.931
You know, Cross
was the arresting officer.

48:54.933 --> 48:56.999
Awkward.

48:59.537 --> 49:02.171
How much time you think they
gone' give him for all that dope?

49:02.607 --> 49:04.640
That much dope?

49:04.642 --> 49:06.475
He's not getting out

49:08.012 --> 49:10.479
That's fucked up.

49:10.481 --> 49:13.683
I hate to see him
go down like this.

49:15.520 --> 49:18.287
I know it had to hit

49:18.289 --> 49:20.156
Don't they got to test

49:40.078 --> 49:41.677

49:42.647 --> 49:45.031
Man...

49:45.032 --> 49:47.416
Hey so if they test the
dope and it ain't real,

49:47.418 --> 49:48.651

01:15:50.313 --> 01:15:52.013

01:16:24.814 --> 01:16:25.880

01:16:27.984 --> 01:16:30.952

01:17:03.653 --> 01:17:04.819
Well, you know,

01:17:04.821 --> 01:17:05.987

And...

01:17:09.092 --> 01:17:10.625

01:18:03.246 --> 01:18:05.146
It's about what you can
contribute to the world.

01:18:05.148 --> 01:18:07.281

Lord have mercy! You know I heard the
ladies down at bingo talking about this.

01:20:30.092 --> 01:20:32.459
You're going to thank me

Well, I was on my lunch break. I said I

Well, thank you

01:20:45.107 --> 01:20:46.540
I don't know how
to feel about this.

01:20:46.542 --> 01:20:48.309
- Love you, grandma.
- Love you too.

01:20:48.311 --> 01:20:49.577

Smell good though.

01:23:27.403 --> 01:23:30.571

Now, you know

we want you to know that

01:27:46.528 --> 01:27:49.830
though you are grieving
at this time,

01:27:49.832 --> 01:27:53.300
that this is a time
to comfort one another.

01:27:53.302 --> 01:27:57.037
<i>To the bereaved family,
the Johnson family,</i>

01:27:57.039 --> 01:28:01.308

<i>we want to remind you

01:28:10.819 --> 01:28:15.789
<i>concerning those who
need comfort in this time.</i>

01:28:15.791 --> 01:28:18.925
The Bible says
in 2nd Corinthians,

01:28:18.927 --> 01:28:23.930
it reads, "Blessed be God,
the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ

01:28:23.932 --> 01:28:25.899
"the Father of all mercies

01:28:25.901 --> 01:28:27.534
"and the God of all comfort,

01:28:28.404 --> 01:28:29.936
"who comforts us

01:28:29.938 --> 01:28:32.806
"in all of our tribulations,

01:28:32.808 --> 01:28:35.509
"that we may be able
to comfort those

01:28:36.045 --> 01:28:38.479
"who are in any trouble

01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:40.914
"with the comforted that we
ourselves are comforted."

01:28:42.551 --> 01:28:43.784
We know that

01:28:43.786 --> 01:28:44.885
Ms. Johnson,

01:28:44.887 --> 01:28:45.986
Grandma,

01:28:45.988 --> 01:28:47.921
as everybody know her,

01:28:49.024 --> 01:28:50.857
<i>has taken wings</i>

01:28:50.859 --> 01:28:52.859
<i>and gone off
to a better place.</i>
