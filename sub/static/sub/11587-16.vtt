SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES

00:03.737 --> 00:05.206

ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:05.239 --> 00:07.408
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:07.441 --> 00:09.410
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:09.443 --> 00:11.045
ARE MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:11.079 --> 00:13.081
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:13.114 --> 00:15.616
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:15.649 --> 00:17.085

00:17.118 --> 00:18.286
YOU SPENT
THREE YEARS UNDERCOVER

00:18.319 --> 00:20.221
AS MUSCLE

00:20.254 --> 00:21.622
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

00:21.655 --> 00:24.292
- YEAH. MY SEVERANCE WAS
TWO BULLETS IN THE CHEST.

00:24.325 --> 00:27.128
- CASSIDY, CAN WE PRACTICE
ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS

00:27.161 --> 00:28.196
IN THE ORDER I ASK THEM?

00:28.229 --> 00:30.731
- OKAY. SURE, COUNSELOR.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.233
- ALL RIGHT.

00:32.266 --> 00:35.436
IN THE COURSE OF YOUR EMPLOYMENT
WITH MR. GANZEL,

00:35.469 --> 00:39.307
DID YOU MEET A PROSTITUTE
NAMED CARISSA GIBSON?

00:39.340 --> 00:41.242
- WE REALLY NEED
TO REHASH ALL THAT? HUH?

00:41.275 --> 00:44.445
HEY, GANZEL CONFESSED
TO MURDER ON TAPE.

00:44.478 --> 00:45.713
- YEAH, WELL,
HIS NEW ATTORNEY IS CONTESTING

00:45.746 --> 00:47.281
THE TAPE'S ADMISSIBILITY.

00:47.315 --> 00:49.183
- YEAH? AND HOW'S THAT
MY PROBLEM?

00:49.217 --> 00:50.284
- LOOK, I WISH
YOU WEREN'T MY WITNESS.

00:50.318 --> 00:51.785
YOU WISH
YOU WEREN'T MY WITNESS.

00:51.819 --> 00:56.090
BUT HERE WE ARE,
SO LET'S GET THROUGH THIS.

00:56.124 --> 00:58.092
- ASK AWAY, COUNSELOR.

00:58.126 --> 00:59.660
- YEAH,
I'LL AMTRAK DOWN SUNDAY.

00:59.693 --> 01:03.697
MAYBE TAKE ZARA
TO THE NATIONAL ZOO.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.566
YEAH, I'LL HOLD.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.101

01:07.135 --> 01:08.802
NEW YORK TO D.C., 20 BUCKS.

01:08.836 --> 01:10.538
- YOU HAVE NO STOPS
FOR BATHROOM BREAKS.

01:10.571 --> 01:13.641
- SEE, THAT'S WHY
I DON'T TAKE TRIPS WITH WOMEN.

01:13.674 --> 01:14.875
- OH, I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT WAS VOLUNTARY.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.644
- [chuckles]
- GO HOME, MUNCH.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.346
THERE'LL BE BAD GUYS

01:19.680 --> 01:20.881
AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
WITH DETECTIVE BENSON?

01:20.914 --> 01:22.483

01:22.516 --> 01:24.118
- WITH THE CAPTAIN
ON VACATION?

01:24.152 --> 01:25.419
DON'T WORRY ABOUT US,
WE'RE FINE.

01:25.453 --> 01:27.755
WE'LL CARRY ON.
- MARIA, ALL RIGHT, JUST LISTEN.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.490
HEY--

01:29.523 --> 01:30.724
YEAH, I DON'T SEE
HOW IT CAN CONFLICT

01:30.758 --> 01:32.193
WITH HER SCHEDULE, MARIA.

01:32.226 --> 01:33.494
SHE'S SIX.

01:33.527 --> 01:35.363
WELL...

01:35.396 --> 01:37.231
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

01:37.265 --> 01:39.267
[hangs up phone]

01:39.300 --> 01:40.534
CAN I HELP YOU?

01:40.568 --> 01:42.836
- I HOPE SO.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.338
I WAS RAPED.

01:44.372 --> 01:46.740
BY A COP.

01:46.774 --> 01:49.777
- SHE SAYS CASSIDY RAPED HER?

01:49.810 --> 01:51.245
OUR CASSIDY?

01:51.279 --> 01:52.280
- SHE SAYS
IT WAS FOUR YEARS AGO.

01:52.313 --> 01:53.547
HE WAS UNDERCOVER
WITH SOME PIMP.

01:53.581 --> 01:55.149
NEVER SAW HIM AGAIN

01:55.183 --> 01:56.217
TILL SHE RECOGNIZED HIS PICTURE
IN THE PAPER

01:56.250 --> 01:57.685
ABOUT THE GANZEL TRIAL.

01:57.718 --> 02:00.154
- WELL, THAT'S ONE HELL
OF A COINCIDENCE.

02:00.188 --> 02:02.656
CASSIDY'S GETTING READY
TO TESTIFY AGAINST GANZEL,

02:02.690 --> 02:05.226
AND THIS WOMAN APPEARS,
MAKING ACCUSATIONS.

02:05.259 --> 02:07.328
- ALL RIGHT, WE KNOW
HE CROSSED SOME LINES.

02:07.361 --> 02:09.363
- YOU WERE HERE WHEN GANZEL
DRUGGED OUR CAPTAIN,

02:09.397 --> 02:10.664
PUT A DEAD HOOKER
IN HIS BED.

02:10.698 --> 02:12.233
- YOU MEAN CARISSA:

02:12.266 --> 02:13.801
THE HOOKER
CASSIDY HAD AN AFFAIR WITH?

02:13.834 --> 02:15.603
- YEAH, THAT'S WHY
HE WAS BUSTED DOWN TO UNI,

02:15.636 --> 02:17.338
AND WORKS NIGHTS
AT A BRONX COURTHOUSE.

02:17.371 --> 02:18.839
HE'S PAID THE PRICE.

02:18.872 --> 02:20.441
- OKAY, SO WHAT DO WE DO, HMM?

02:20.474 --> 02:21.942
TELL THIS WOMAN
TO TAKE A HIKE?

02:21.975 --> 02:23.511
- THERE'S PROTOCOL.

02:23.544 --> 02:26.447
WE HAVE TO NOTIFY IAB
OR OUR COMMANDING OFFICER.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.316
WE'LL TRY CRAGEN FIRST.

02:28.349 --> 02:31.319
- ON A FISHING BOAT
OFF BIMINI?

02:31.352 --> 02:33.254
- RULES ARE RULES.

02:34.822 --> 02:37.825
I DON'T WANT YOU
ENJOYING THIS TOO MUCH, OKAY?

02:37.858 --> 02:39.360

02:42.530 --> 02:44.332
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?
- NUMBNUTS.

02:44.365 --> 02:46.300
DON'T YOU ASK WHO IT IS
BEFORE YOUR OPEN THE DOOR?

02:46.334 --> 02:47.535
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE
MY THAI FOOD.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.403
- WE NEED TO TALK.

02:49.437 --> 02:51.205
- NOW. CAN WE COME IN?

02:51.239 --> 02:52.906
- IT'S NOT A REAL GOOD TIME
RIGHT NOW, GUYS.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.375
- BRI--
- I GOT THIS.

02:54.408 --> 02:55.409
IT'S TAKEN CARE OF.

02:55.443 --> 02:57.378

- YEAH.

02:57.411 --> 02:58.212
IT'S YOUR SISTER.

02:58.246 --> 02:59.713
YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME
SHE SNORES.

02:59.747 --> 03:01.349
I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW.

[edgy pop music]

04:02.676 --> 04:02.943

04:02.976 --> 04:03.544
- IAB CALLED ME AT 6:00 A.M.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.380

04:06.414 --> 04:07.415
BUT YOU WERE BUSY.

04:07.448 --> 04:08.682

04:08.716 --> 04:09.917
WHERE'S THIS COMING FROM?

04:09.950 --> 04:11.852

04:11.885 --> 04:13.754
- HEATHER WHO?

04:13.787 --> 04:17.425
- SHE LOOK FAMILIAR?

04:23.897 --> 04:25.599
- YEAH.

04:28.035 --> 04:30.003
YEAH, I THOUGHT HER NAME
WAS BROOKLYN.

04:30.037 --> 04:32.740
SHE WAS A WORKING GIRL.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.675
WHAT HAPPENED?

04:34.708 --> 04:37.411
SHE GET ARRESTED?
SHE TRY TO MAKE A DEAL?

04:37.445 --> 04:39.012
- SHE CAME IN
OF HER OWN ACCORD.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.881
- RIGHT BEFORE I TESTIFY
AGAINST GANZEL?

04:40.914 --> 04:42.583
- WELL, SHE SAID SHE NEVER
WORKED FOR GANZEL.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.419
- YEAH, SHE DIDN'T.

04:45.453 --> 04:46.954
'CAUSE BEFORE THAT,

TOTAL SLEAZEBAG.
HE GOT PUT AWAY.

04:55.863 --> 04:57.931

SHE WAS FORCED INTO HOOKING,

04:57.965 --> 05:00.033
AND LAROUCHE HAD YOU
BREAK HER IN.

05:00.067 --> 05:04.372
- SHE'S LYING.

05:04.405 --> 05:06.674
AND YOU PASSED ON THE REPORT
TO IAB?

05:06.707 --> 05:08.476

YOU KNOW WE HAD NO CHOICE.

05:10.544 --> 05:13.046
- YEAH, RIGHT.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.548
[chair clattering]

05:18.519 --> 05:20.354
- CASSIDY, WHAT'S UP, MAN?

05:20.388 --> 05:22.490
- JUST STOPPED BY FOR BREAKFAST.

05:22.523 --> 05:23.524

05:23.557 --> 05:24.958
- HEY, LIV.
- HEY.

05:24.992 --> 05:28.729
- LONG TIME, NO SEE.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.734
- ARE WE MISSING SOMETHING HERE?

05:33.767 --> 05:35.903

TO KNOW.

05:35.936 --> 05:38.972
- MM.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.408
- NICK, WHAT'S GOING ON?

05:40.441 --> 05:41.409
- YOU SHOULD ASK HIM.

05:41.442 --> 05:43.477
[metallic rattling]

05:43.511 --> 05:44.712
- OKAY.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.414
- REALLY?

05:46.447 --> 05:47.881
YOU AND CASSIDY.

05:47.915 --> 05:49.417
- "A," I DIDN'T TELL YOU,

05:49.450 --> 05:51.685
BECAUSE IT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

05:51.719 --> 05:53.954
AND, "B," IT'S NOT
THAT BIG OF A DEAL.

05:53.987 --> 05:55.756
AND "C," NICK,
I DIDN'T TELL YOU,

05:55.789 --> 05:57.991
BECAUSE I DIDN'T
WANT THIS.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.734
- JUST A LYNCH MOB
ORGANIZED BY GANZEL.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.769
HE GAVE AMARO THE ROPE.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.003
- OKAY, HOW ABOUT WE BE

06:10.037 --> 06:13.641
A LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC
THAN THAT.

06:13.674 --> 06:16.910
- I'M BEING FRAMED FOR RAPE.

06:16.944 --> 06:20.648
- RAPE?
- YEAH.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.115
- WHEN?

06:22.149 --> 06:23.484
WHO?

06:23.517 --> 06:25.486
- I GOTTA SAY, LIV,

06:25.519 --> 06:28.822
I THINK YOU'RE ASKING
THE WRONG QUESTIONS HERE.

06:28.856 --> 06:31.492
- OKAY.

06:31.525 --> 06:34.895
OKAY, SO HOW 'BOUT YOU TELL ME
WHAT I SHOULD ASK?

06:38.499 --> 06:40.634
- INTERNAL AFFAIRS?
REALLY?

06:40.668 --> 06:42.002
GOOD GOD.

06:42.035 --> 06:44.505
- BARBA SAYS
THAT IF CASSIDY WAS FRAMED,

06:44.538 --> 06:46.840
IAB WILL FIGURE IT OUT.

06:46.874 --> 06:48.642
- YOU KIDDIN' ME?
IAB?

06:48.676 --> 06:50.043
THEY MAKE FRAMES,
THEY DON'T BREAK 'EM.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.645
- I MEAN, YOU TWO KNOW HIM.

06:51.679 --> 06:53.013
ANY WAY HE'S GOOD FOR THIS?
- NO.

06:53.046 --> 06:54.882
BUT HE'S NOT GOOD
AT DEFENDING HIMSELF,

06:54.915 --> 06:56.116
AND WE HAVE
TO LOOK INTO THIS.

06:56.149 --> 06:57.651
- DISCREETLY, OF COURSE.

06:57.685 --> 07:00.588
WE CANNOT TALK TO THE VIC.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.055
- SO WE TALK
TO THE PEOPLE THAT KNOW HER.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.091
- WELL, SHE DID MENTION A JOB.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.759
- LEGIT?

07:05.793 --> 07:06.927
- SHE TEACHES
AT A POLE DANCING STUDIO,

07:06.960 --> 07:08.028
EAST VILLAGE.

07:08.061 --> 07:09.697
COME ON, FIN.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.465
LET'S WORK ON OUR TECHNIQUE.

07:13.734 --> 07:16.470
[dance music]
- ENGAGE YOUR CORE.

07:16.504 --> 07:17.905
PLACE THE SECOND HAND.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.139
LEG AROUND.

07:19.172 --> 07:23.777
AND SPIN.

07:23.811 --> 07:26.547
- SOMETHING IS VERY WRONG
ABOUT THIS.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.482
- BEATS JOGGING, I GUESS.

07:28.516 --> 07:30.150
- I'M BOBBY NAVARRO.
YOU WANTED TO SEE THE MANAGER?

07:30.183 --> 07:32.520
- YEAH, WE ACTUALLY WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU

07:32.553 --> 07:34.154
ABOUT ONE OF YOUR INSTRUCTORS,
HEATHER RIGGS.

07:34.187 --> 07:36.524
- HEATHER? GOOD PEOPLE.
WHAT ABOUT HER?

07:36.557 --> 07:37.891
- JUST A ROUTINE
BACKGROUND CHECK.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.627
HOW LONG
HAS SHE WORKED HERE?

07:39.660 --> 07:40.894
- ABOUT A YEAR.

07:40.928 --> 07:41.929
SHE'S VERY POPULAR.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.096
- IS SHE RELIABLE?

07:43.130 --> 07:45.533
- VERY.
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

07:45.566 --> 07:46.800
- HEATHER HAVE
ANY MONEY PROBLEMS?

07:46.834 --> 07:48.836
- NOT THAT I KNOW OF.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.671
SHE DOES PRETTY WELL HERE,
HAS GOT HER OWN FOLLOWING.

07:50.704 --> 07:53.206
- WHAT ABOUT HER PERSONAL LIFE?
BOYFRIEND?

07:53.240 --> 07:54.808
ANY TROUBLE THERE?

07:54.842 --> 07:56.043
- LOOK, WE'RE MANAGER
AND EMPLOYEE.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.645
I TRUST HER COMPLETELY.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.079
BUT SINCE YOU'RE
NOT TELLING ME WHAT'S GOING ON,

07:59.112 --> 08:01.048
I'M NOT SURE
IF I TRUST YOU SO MUCH.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.883
EXCUSE ME.

08:02.916 --> 08:04.718
- DEFENSIVE?

08:04.752 --> 08:06.654
- MORE LIKE OFFENSIVE.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.155
IF HEATHER'S SO POPULAR,

08:08.188 --> 08:09.757
HOW COME SHE ONLY TEACHES HERE
TWICE A WEEK?

08:09.790 --> 08:14.562
I MEAN, ALL THESE OTHER CHICKS
HAVE FOUR CLASSES A DAY.

08:14.595 --> 08:18.065
IT LOOKS LIKE HEATHER DOES
A LITTLE PRIVATE POLE DANCING

08:18.098 --> 08:20.067
FOR THE MANAGER,
BOBBY NAVARRO.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.569
I MEAN,
THERE'S NO PHOTOS OF HIM

08:21.602 --> 08:23.103
ON ANY
OF HER SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES,

08:23.136 --> 08:24.738
BUT, I MEAN, LOOK AT
THE OTHER INSTRUCTORS' PAGES.

08:24.772 --> 08:25.839
THEY'RE ALL OVER HIM.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.174
- YEAH, AND EACH OTHER.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.642
I WONDER
IF SHE'S EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH.

08:28.676 --> 08:29.777
- [laughs] YEAH.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.111
- SO THE MANAGER,
WHAT DO WE HAVE?

08:31.144 --> 08:33.180
- HE HAS CONVICTIONS
FOR SHOPLIFTING,

08:33.213 --> 08:35.248
POSSESSION,
AND CHECK FRAUD.

08:35.282 --> 08:36.249
- PLUS HE WAS PICKED UP
ON A WIRETAP

08:36.283 --> 08:37.585
WITH A CHINATOWN BOOKIE.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.219
HE'S A CHRONIC GAMBLER,
WHO LOSES, SO...

08:39.252 --> 08:40.788
- WELL, THAT'S REDUNDANT.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.289
- THANK YOU, BUT ACCORDING
TO THE TAP RIGHT NOW,

08:42.322 --> 08:43.924
HE'S DOWN ABOUT 20 LARGE.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.659
- AND BACK
IN HIS CHECK FRAUD DAYS,

08:45.693 --> 08:47.761
HE MADE FAKE I.D.s.

08:47.795 --> 08:49.630
ONE WAS TERRY MATTHEWS.

08:49.663 --> 08:50.798
THE OTHER WAS LEONARD HOROWITZ.

08:50.831 --> 08:52.132
- OKAY, SO HE'S A BAD GUY.

08:52.165 --> 08:53.734
WHAT'S THIS GOT
TO DO WITH HEATHER?

08:53.767 --> 08:55.302
- WELL, CHECK THIS OUT.

08:55.335 --> 08:58.138
THIS IS THE LIST OF GANZEL'S
VISITORS UP AT RIKERS.

08:58.171 --> 08:59.707
CHECK OUT THE LAST NAME.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.575
TERRY MATTHEWS.

09:01.609 --> 09:02.776
- HOLD ON.

09:02.810 --> 09:04.845
HEATHER'S BOYFRIEND
VISITED GANZEL?

09:04.878 --> 09:06.680
WHEN WAS THIS?

09:06.714 --> 09:08.682
- TWO DAYS
BEFORE SHE CAME HERE.

09:08.716 --> 09:09.950
- ALL RIGHT,
SO SCUM KNOWS SCUM.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.685
- GANZEL PAID HIM

09:11.719 --> 09:14.187
TO GET HIS GIRLFRIEND
TO ACCUSE CASSIDY.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.757
- SEE? PARANOIA.
ANYONE CAN PLAY.

09:16.790 --> 09:17.825
I'LL TELL BARBA
THE CONNECTION.

09:17.858 --> 09:20.160
- I HAVE TO TALK
TO BARBA ANYWAY.

09:20.193 --> 09:22.663
- OKAY.

09:22.696 --> 09:25.899
- LIV, YOU WANT BACKUP?

09:25.933 --> 09:29.002
- FOR THE RECORD,
THIS IS OFF THE RECORD.

09:29.036 --> 09:30.237
THIS ISN'T YOUR CASE.

09:30.270 --> 09:32.706
- AH, DULY NOTED,
BUT IT TURNS OUT

09:32.740 --> 09:34.307
THAT OUR ALLEGED VICTIM,
HEATHER RIGGS,

09:34.341 --> 09:36.610
HAS A BOYFRIEND NAMED B--

09:36.644 --> 09:37.678
- BOBBY NAVARRO,
WHO VISITED GANZEL ON RIKERS

09:37.711 --> 09:38.979
THREE DAYS AGO.

09:39.012 --> 09:40.614
IAB KNOWS
HOW TO INVESTIGATE TOO.

09:40.648 --> 09:42.215
- GREAT, SO YOU KNOW.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.351
- NAVARRO HEARS HIS GIRLFRIEND
MET CASSIDY BACK IN THE DAY,

09:44.384 --> 09:45.986
HE KNOWS GANZEL'S
ABOUT TO GO TO TRIAL,

09:46.019 --> 09:47.721
SO HE MIDDLES A DEAL
FOR HEATHER TO SMEAR CASSIDY.

09:47.755 --> 09:49.022
- SO IT'S A CROCK.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.624
CASE CLOSED.

09:50.658 --> 09:51.759
- JUST BECAUSE NAVARRO
SAW AN OPPORTUNITY

09:51.792 --> 09:53.093
TO CASH IN
ON HEATHER'S STORY,

09:53.126 --> 09:55.028
DOESN'T MEAN
IT ISN'T TRUE.

09:55.062 --> 09:56.897
- IT DOES CAST
REASONABLE DOUBT.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.099
- SO FAR, ANY MONEY
CHANGING HANDS IS OFF THE BOOKS.

09:59.132 --> 10:00.768
WE CAN'T FIND IT.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.703
- WHAT, YOU THINK GANZEL PAYS
BY CHECK?

10:02.736 --> 10:03.937
- WE HAVE LOOKED, AND HARD.

10:03.971 --> 10:05.706
AND THERE'S MORE.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.240
HEATHER'S FORMER PIMP, ANDRE,
CONFIRMS

10:07.274 --> 10:08.709
THAT HE SENT HER TO CASSIDY.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.010
- OH, THAT'S A SHOCK.

10:10.043 --> 10:12.780
DID ANDRE GET TIME
OFF HIS SENTENCE FOR THAT?

10:12.813 --> 10:14.848
- AND ONE
OF HIS FORMER PROSTITUTES,

10:14.882 --> 10:16.283
NOW REFORMED,

10:16.316 --> 10:18.652
SWEARS THAT SHE SAW HEATHER GO
INTO THE BEDROOM

10:18.686 --> 10:20.187
WITH CASSIDY
FOR TWO HOURS.

10:20.220 --> 10:23.791
PLUS, HEATHER HAS DESCRIBED
IN GREAT DETAIL

10:23.824 --> 10:25.959
A SCAR ON CASSIDY'S
INNER THIGH.

10:25.993 --> 10:29.997
I'M GETTING A WARRANT
FOR A PHYSICAL EXAMINATION.

10:33.100 --> 10:36.770
- WELL, SAVE YOURSELF
THE TROUBLE.

10:36.804 --> 10:39.773
UH, HIS...LEFT INNER THIGH,

10:39.807 --> 10:42.843
UM...

10:42.876 --> 10:46.947
CASSIDY WAS KNIFED BY A DRUNK
WHEN HE WAS A ROOKIE.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.382
THAT'S THE OTHER THING THAT
I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

10:49.416 --> 10:53.153
- AH.

10:53.186 --> 10:54.822
CURRENT RELATIONSHIP OR PAST?

10:54.855 --> 10:56.690
- BOTH.

10:56.724 --> 10:59.192
WITH A 13-YEAR GAP.

10:59.226 --> 11:01.028
- SO YOU'RE
NOT ENTIRELY OBJECTIVE.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.896
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.164
- DETECTIVE AMARO.

11:04.197 --> 11:06.033
YOU TALKED
TO THE COMPLAINANT.

11:06.066 --> 11:10.771
WAS SHE CREDIBLE?

11:10.804 --> 11:11.872
- YEAH, SHE WAS.

11:11.905 --> 11:14.875
- NICK, CASSIDY
WOULD NEVER RAPE ANYONE.

11:14.908 --> 11:19.346
- BUT IT'S POSSIBLE HE KNEW SHE
WAS BEING FORCIBLY COMPELLED.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.014
AND WE KNOW THAT
HE HAS SLEPT WITH PROSTITUTES

11:21.048 --> 11:22.315
ON THE JOB BEFORE.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.917
- YES, I REMEMBER, THANK YOU.

11:23.951 --> 11:25.052
- [sighs]

11:25.085 --> 11:27.087
A D.A. FROM WESTCHESTER
IS COMING IN

11:27.120 --> 11:29.256
TO RUN THE TRIAL.

11:29.289 --> 11:31.759
- THE TRIAL?
- WE'RE ON A FAST TRACK.

11:31.792 --> 11:35.362
WE CAN'T APPEAR
TO BE PROTECTING OUR OWN.

11:35.395 --> 11:39.767
IAB DETECTIVES ARE
ARRESTING CASSIDY RIGHT NOW.

11:52.479 --> 11:52.946
.

11:52.980 --> 11:53.881
- I'M NOT GUILTY.
- NOT GUILTY, YOUR HONOR.

11:55.482 --> 11:56.850
- PEOPLE ON BAIL?
- REMAND.

11:56.884 --> 11:58.451
THE DEFENDANT WORKED UNDERCOVER
FOR YEARS.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.220
WE BELIEVE HE MAY HAVE
HIDDEN FINANCIAL RESOURCES.

12:00.253 --> 12:03.056
AND A RAPE CHARGE
GIVES HIM MOTIVE TO FLEE.

12:03.090 --> 12:05.292
- DETECTIVE CASSIDY
IS A DECORATED OFFICER

12:05.325 --> 12:06.493
WITH NO FINANCIAL RESOURCES,

12:06.526 --> 12:08.361
NOT TO MENTION NO MOTIVATION,

12:08.395 --> 12:10.363
SINCE THE CHARGE IS BASELESS.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.432
- WE WOULDN'T BE HERE
IF IT WAS BASELESS, YOUR HONOR.

12:12.465 --> 12:14.534
- THE COURT WELCOMES
A.D.A. DEREK STRAUSS

12:14.567 --> 12:16.303
FROM WESTCHESTER COUNTY

12:16.336 --> 12:18.939
AND NOTES HIS OBVIOUS AND
NOT ESPECIALLY USEFUL REMARK.

12:18.972 --> 12:21.408
THE DEFENDANT IS RELEASED
ON HIS OWN RECOGNIZANCE.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.944
HE WILL SURRENDER HIS PASSPORT
AND REPORT IN DAILY.

12:23.977 --> 12:25.312
- YOUR HONOR--

12:25.345 --> 12:26.546
- WELCOME TO THE BIG CITY,
MR. STRAUSS.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.548
[gavel bangs]
- SERIOUSLY, STRAUSS?

12:28.581 --> 12:30.283
"HIDDEN FINANCIAL RESOURCES"?

12:30.317 --> 12:31.551
COME ON, I'VE BEEN
ON A UNI'S SALARY

12:31.584 --> 12:33.787
FOR SIX MONTHS, ALL RIGHT?

12:33.821 --> 12:36.223
- TAKE IT EASY, TAKE IT EASY.
SMALL BATTLE WON:

12:36.256 --> 12:37.490
BIG WAR TO COME.

12:37.524 --> 12:42.262
DETECTIVE, YOU ARE
A VISION TODAY.

12:42.295 --> 12:44.164
- LIV.

12:44.197 --> 12:46.199
- [under breath]
HEY.

12:46.233 --> 12:47.801
HEATHER'S STICKING
BY HER STORY.

12:47.835 --> 12:50.070
TWO WITNESSES PUT YOU
IN THAT BEDROOM WITH HER,

12:50.103 --> 12:52.840
AND SHE DESCRIBED
THE SCAR ON YOUR LEG.

12:52.873 --> 12:54.174
THAT ONE.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.343
SEE THE PROBLEM?

12:56.376 --> 12:58.011
- NOTHIN' HAPPENED.

12:58.045 --> 12:59.312
- SO YOU WEREN'T
IN THAT BEDROOM WITH HER

12:59.346 --> 13:00.848
FOR TWO HOURS?

13:00.881 --> 13:02.482
- THAT PART'S TRUE,
BUT NOTHING HAPPENED.

13:02.515 --> 13:03.550
- SO HOW DOES SHE KNOW
ABOUT THE SCAR ON YOUR LEG?

13:03.583 --> 13:05.152
- I DON'T KNOW.

13:05.185 --> 13:06.453
A MILLION WAYS.

13:06.486 --> 13:09.522
IT'S NOT A STATE SECRET, LIV.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.024
HEY, LOOK!

13:11.058 --> 13:12.826
I DIDN'T DO THIS.

13:12.860 --> 13:17.064
- [sighs]

13:17.097 --> 13:18.465
SO WHAT HAPPENED
IN THAT BEDROOM?

13:18.498 --> 13:21.902
- THIS PIMP WAS
A REAL PIECE OF CRAP, OKAY?

13:21.935 --> 13:23.436
I KNEW SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO BE THERE.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.939
I COULDN'T BLOW MY COVER.

13:25.973 --> 13:27.574
SO I JUST MADE UP AN EXCUSE

13:27.607 --> 13:29.409
AND WENT
TO THE BACK BEDROOM,

13:29.442 --> 13:33.080
AND WE JUST TALKED.

13:33.113 --> 13:34.347
- OKAY.

13:34.381 --> 13:36.116
- OKAY, WHAT?

13:36.149 --> 13:38.085
YOU DO BELIEVE ME?

13:38.118 --> 13:41.221
- OF COURSE I DO.

13:44.524 --> 13:46.960
- I WAS 17.

13:46.994 --> 13:49.496
I RAN AWAY FROM HOME.

13:49.529 --> 13:51.364
I WANTED TO BE AN ACTRESS.

13:51.398 --> 13:54.434
THEN I MET ANDRE.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.503
HE SAID HE COULD HELP.
- DID HE HELP?

13:56.536 --> 14:00.607
- NO, HE LOCKED ME IN
AN APARTMENT WITH OTHER GIRLS...

14:00.640 --> 14:02.609
TOOK AWAY MY CLOTHES.

14:02.642 --> 14:05.012
HE MADE US HAVE SEX
WITH STRANGERS.

14:05.045 --> 14:07.014
- THOSE STRANGERS...

14:07.047 --> 14:09.516
HE MADE YOU HAVE SEX WITH,

14:09.549 --> 14:10.583
DO YOU SEE
ONE OF THEM HERE?

14:10.617 --> 14:13.353
- YES.

14:13.386 --> 14:14.621
HIM.

14:14.654 --> 14:16.189
- LET THE RECORD REFLECT

14:16.223 --> 14:18.391
SHE'S POINTING
AT THE DEFENDANT BRIAN CASSIDY.

14:18.425 --> 14:20.293
- HE SAID HIS NAME WAS RICK.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.529
I THOUGHT HE WAS
A FRIEND OF ANDRE'S.

14:22.562 --> 14:25.232
ANDRE TOLD HIM
THAT I WAS NEW.

14:25.265 --> 14:27.467
[voice trembles] AND THAT
HE SHOULD HELP BREAK ME IN.

14:27.500 --> 14:30.037
- AND IS THAT
WHEN DETECTIVE CASSIDY TOOK YOU

14:30.070 --> 14:32.372
INTO THE BEDROOM?

14:32.405 --> 14:37.144
- [crying] I DIDN'T KNOW
HE WAS A DETECTIVE.

14:37.177 --> 14:39.079
[sobbing]
WE HAD SEX.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.647
I DIDN'T WANT TO.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.349
HE KNEW I DIDN'T WANT TO.

14:42.382 --> 14:46.653
I CRIED THE WHOLE TIME.

14:46.686 --> 14:49.556
- ARE YOU SURE
THE MAN YOU WERE WITH...

14:49.589 --> 14:52.092
IS THE DEFENDANT?

14:52.125 --> 14:54.561
- YES.

14:54.594 --> 14:58.298
I SAW THE SCAR NEXT TO HIS...

14:58.331 --> 15:00.567
HIS BUSINESS.
[sniffles]

15:00.600 --> 15:04.204
- THANK YOU.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.508
- MS. RIGGS.

15:08.541 --> 15:11.244
WHAT WOULD ANDRE HAVE DONE

15:11.278 --> 15:14.081
IF HE'D KNOWN
YOU DIDN'T HAVE SEX

15:14.114 --> 15:16.516
WITH DETECTIVE CASSIDY?

15:16.549 --> 15:18.251
- HE'D HAVE BEATEN ME.

15:18.285 --> 15:22.089
HE USED SACKS OF ORANGES
SO THE BRUISES WOULDN'T SHOW.

15:22.122 --> 15:25.558
- SO IF DETECTIVE CASSIDY WANTED
TO PROTECT YOU,

15:25.592 --> 15:27.594
HE WOULD HAVE KEPT YOU
IN THAT ROOM

15:27.627 --> 15:28.728
FOR A WHILE.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.264
- PROTECT ME?

15:31.298 --> 15:32.532
NOBODY PROTECTED ME.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.201
- EVEN NOW...

15:34.234 --> 15:37.704
IS ANYONE PROTECTING YOU?

15:37.737 --> 15:39.472
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

15:39.506 --> 15:41.708
- DO YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND NAMED
BOBBY NAVARRO?

15:41.741 --> 15:43.010
- YES.

15:43.043 --> 15:45.178
- ARE YOU AWARE

15:45.212 --> 15:46.679
HE VISITED BART GANZEL
IN PRISON?

15:46.713 --> 15:48.615
THAT HE ATTEMPTED
TO GET MONEY

15:48.648 --> 15:51.051
IN EXCHANGE
FOR YOUR TESTIMONY

15:51.084 --> 15:52.585
AGAINST DETECTIVE CASSIDY?

15:52.619 --> 15:56.189
- I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT HE DID THAT UNTIL AFTER.

15:56.223 --> 15:58.458
AND--AND HE DIDN'T GET MONEY.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.727
- BUT YOU ARE PLANNING ON
CASHING IN ON THIS,

16:00.760 --> 16:02.195
AREN'T YOU?

16:02.229 --> 16:03.763
HAVEN'T YOU HIRED AN ATTORNEY

16:03.796 --> 16:05.698
TO SUE THE CITY FOR DAMAGES?

16:05.732 --> 16:07.234
- I WAS RAPED!

16:07.267 --> 16:10.970
SOMEBODY OUGHT
TO BE RESPONSIBLE!

16:12.705 --> 16:15.375
- I'M AN OUTREACH COUNSELOR

16:15.408 --> 16:19.079
WITH AN ORGANIZATION
THAT HELPS FORMER SEX WORKERS

16:19.112 --> 16:20.780
AND TRAFFICKED WOMEN.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.549
- AND HOW DID YOU GET
INTO THIS FIELD?

16:22.582 --> 16:24.384
- PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.

16:24.417 --> 16:26.219
I WAS A TRAFFICKED SEX WORKER.

16:26.253 --> 16:28.421
FOR A PIMP
NAMED ANDRE LAROUCHE.

16:28.455 --> 16:30.623
- THE SAME PIMP
WHO EMPLOYED HEATHER RIGGS.

16:30.657 --> 16:31.791
- YES.

16:31.824 --> 16:34.261
HEATHER WAS NEW.

16:34.294 --> 16:37.730
AND TERRIFIED.

16:37.764 --> 16:42.302
ANDRE ORDERED HER
INTO A BEDROOM WITH HIM.

16:42.335 --> 16:45.205
THEY WERE IN THERE TOGETHER
FOR AT LEAST TWO HOURS.

16:45.238 --> 16:47.340
- THANK YOU.

16:47.374 --> 16:50.410
- DID YOU SEE MS. RIGGS
AND DETECTIVE CASSIDY

16:50.443 --> 16:51.678
HAVING SEX?

16:51.711 --> 16:52.712
- NO.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.214
THE DOOR TO THE ROOM
WAS CLOSED.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.516
- DID YOU HEAR THEM?
- NO.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.185
I WAS ASSIGNED TO ANOTHER ROOM
A FEW MINUTES LATER.

16:58.218 --> 17:01.221
- DID YOU HEAR
THE ALLEGED COMMENT

17:01.254 --> 17:03.356
YOUR PIMP MADE
TO DETECTIVE CASSIDY--

17:03.390 --> 17:07.160
THAT HE WANTED HIM
TO "BREAK MS. RIGGS IN"?

17:07.194 --> 17:08.395
- I DIDN'T.

17:08.428 --> 17:11.231
- BUT THAT ALLEGED COMMENT,

17:11.264 --> 17:14.601
WHICH APPARENTLY NOBODY
BUT MS. RIGGS HEARD,

17:14.634 --> 17:15.702
IS THE ONLY WAY

17:15.735 --> 17:17.804
DETECTIVE CASSIDY
WOULD HAVE KNOWN

17:17.837 --> 17:19.272
SHE WASN'T WILLING?

17:19.306 --> 17:20.740
- THE ONLY WAY?

17:20.773 --> 17:23.743
WE WEREN'T GIRLS
GOING OUT WITH GUYS

17:23.776 --> 17:24.844
TO DINNER AND A MOVIE,

17:24.877 --> 17:26.713
AND THEN, MAYBE,
IF WE LIKED THEM,

17:26.746 --> 17:28.815
THEY'D GET LUCKY.

17:28.848 --> 17:31.684
WE WERE LOCKED IN A ROOM.

17:31.718 --> 17:35.388
WE HAD DOG COLLARS
AROUND OUR NECKS.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.457
I'D SAY IT'S
PRETTY DAMN OBVIOUS

17:37.490 --> 17:41.528
SHE WASN'T WILLING.

17:41.561 --> 17:44.431
- SHE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH.

17:44.464 --> 17:46.766
SHE JUST DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT ROOM.

17:46.799 --> 17:48.768
- WELL, THAT'S THE PROBLEM
WITH SEX CRIMES:

17:48.801 --> 17:51.638
NO ONE EVER DOES, EXCEPT
THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THERE,

17:51.671 --> 17:52.872
AND THEY ALWAYS DISAGREE.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.874
- YOU WANT
TO TAKE THE STAND, JOHN?

17:54.907 --> 17:56.343
- I ALREADY ASKED YOUR LAWYER.

17:56.376 --> 17:57.844
HE FEELS THAT,
BECAUSE YOU AND I WERE PARTNERS,

17:57.877 --> 18:00.113
THAT THE JURY'D PERCEIVE ME
AS BEING BIASED,

18:00.147 --> 18:01.714
WHICH, OF COURSE,
I WOULD BE.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.183
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR PAL, AMARO?

18:03.216 --> 18:04.817
THE D.A.'S CALLING HIM
AS A WITNESS.

18:04.851 --> 18:06.186
- HE'S NOT IN YOUR FAN CLUB,

18:06.219 --> 18:07.754
BUT HE CAUGHT
HEATHER'S STATEMENT,

18:07.787 --> 18:09.756
SO THAT'S ALL
THEY'RE GONNA ASK HIM ABOUT.

18:09.789 --> 18:12.825
- YOU KNOW HE'S GONNA TRY TO
THROW ME UNDER THE BUS, RIGHT?

18:12.859 --> 18:14.327
- HE WAS UNDERCOVER FOR YEARS.

18:14.361 --> 18:15.862
HE KNOWS EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH.

18:15.895 --> 18:18.131
OKAY?

18:20.767 --> 18:22.835
- DETECTIVE, WHEN YOU
FIRST QUESTIONED THE DEFENDANT

18:22.869 --> 18:24.571
ABOUT MS. RIGGS,

18:24.604 --> 18:26.839
HOW DID HE DESCRIBE
HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH HER?

18:26.873 --> 18:28.675
- HE SAID
HE RECOGNIZED HER PICTURE

18:28.708 --> 18:30.177
AND REMEMBERED MEETING HER.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.744
- WOULD YOU SAY
HE WAS FORTHCOMING?

18:31.778 --> 18:32.812
- HE WAS FORTHRIGHT
IN HIS ANGER

18:32.845 --> 18:34.247
AND SAID
HE WAS BEING SET UP

18:34.281 --> 18:35.815
AND THAT NOTHING
HAD HAPPENED.

18:35.848 --> 18:38.218
- SO HE NEVER TOLD YOU
HE WENT INTO A BEDROOM

18:38.251 --> 18:40.920
WITH MS. RIGGS
FOR TWO HOURS?

18:40.953 --> 18:43.156
- NO, HE DIDN'T.
- YOU'VE WORKED UNDERCOVER,

18:43.190 --> 18:44.491
HAVEN'T YOU, DETECTIVE?

18:44.524 --> 18:46.793
- YES, ON AND OFF
FOR EIGHT YEARS.

18:46.826 --> 18:50.530
- YOU EVER GO INTO A BEDROOM
ALONE WITH A SEX SLAVE?

18:52.799 --> 18:54.901
- NO.

18:54.934 --> 18:57.904
- YOU WERE TRAINED TO AVOID
COMPROMISING SITUATIONS?

18:57.937 --> 19:00.673
- AS OFTEN AS POSSIBLE,
YEAH, BUT EVERY SITUA--

19:00.707 --> 19:02.809
- SO GOING INTO A BEDROOM ALONE
WITH A PROSTITUTE,

19:02.842 --> 19:07.680
THAT WOULD BE AN INVITATION
TO COMMIT A CRIME?

19:07.714 --> 19:09.749
- ISN'T THAT A HYPOTHETICAL?

19:09.782 --> 19:10.950
- WELL, IT'S
AN UNLAWFUL SITUATION:

19:10.983 --> 19:12.752
YES OR NO?

19:12.785 --> 19:14.421
- YES, BUT AGAIN,

19:14.454 --> 19:15.888
I CAN'T PUT MYSELF
IN ANOTHER UC'S POSITION.

19:15.922 --> 19:17.357
- I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO.

19:17.390 --> 19:18.825
I'M ASKING,
WHAT WOULD YOU DO

19:18.858 --> 19:19.926
IF A SEX TRAFFICKER
YOU WERE INVESTIGATING

19:19.959 --> 19:21.428
OFFERED YOU THE SERVICES

19:21.461 --> 19:25.932
OF A SEMI-NAKED WOMAN
WEARING A DOG COLLAR?

19:25.965 --> 19:26.799
- I WOULD DECLINE.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.768
- UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES?

19:28.801 --> 19:31.271
- YES.

19:31.304 --> 19:34.207
- THANK YOU.

19:34.241 --> 19:35.808
- CROSS, MR. QUERNS?

19:35.842 --> 19:37.644
- WHY DON'T WE TAKE THIS UP

19:37.677 --> 19:39.479
AFTER LUNCH, YOUR HONOR?

19:39.512 --> 19:40.813
- VERY WELL.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.715
COURT'S IN RECESS.
[bangs gavel]

19:45.585 --> 19:46.819
- MR. BARBA.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.288
HOW'S THE VIEW
FROM THE CHEAP SEATS?

19:48.321 --> 19:49.556
- FASCINATING.

19:49.589 --> 19:50.990
ESPECIALLY WHEN
A DEFENSE ATTORNEY

19:51.023 --> 19:52.692
ALLOWS A PROSECUTOR
TO TURN A SIMPLE FACT WITNESS

19:52.725 --> 19:54.827
INTO A CHARACTER ASSASSIN
WITHOUT OBJECTING.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.696
- MY GOD,
THAT DEFENSE ATTORNEY

19:56.729 --> 19:58.231
SOUNDS LIKE
A COMPLETE INCOMPETENT.

19:58.265 --> 19:59.499
- YES, BUT HE ISN'T.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.834
SO I WONDER WHY?
- LOVE TO CHAT.

20:01.868 --> 20:05.438
WE ONLY HAVE AN HOUR
FOR LUNCH.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.312
DETECTIVE,
IT MUST FEEL ODD

20:12.345 --> 20:15.982
TESTIFYING AGAINST
A FELLOW UNDERCOVER OFFICER.

20:16.015 --> 20:17.984
- IT'S NOT
THE MOST COMFORTABLE THING.

20:18.017 --> 20:19.419
- BECAUSE UNDERCOVER OFFICERS

20:19.452 --> 20:21.821
SHARE CERTAIN UNIQUE PRESSURES
AND EXPERIENCES,

20:21.854 --> 20:23.390
DO THEY NOT?

20:23.423 --> 20:25.492
- OBJECTION. YOUR HONOR,
WHAT'S THE RELEVANCE?

20:25.525 --> 20:27.894
- YOUR HONOR, THE PROSECUTION
QUESTIONED THIS WITNESS

20:27.927 --> 20:30.730
AT LENGTH
ABOUT UNDERCOVER OPERATIONS.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.865
THAT DOOR HAS BEEN OPENED.

20:32.899 --> 20:33.900
- SO IT HAS.

20:33.933 --> 20:35.735
YOU MAY PROCEED.

20:35.768 --> 20:37.870
- DETECTIVE,
DON'T UNDERCOVER OFFICERS

20:37.904 --> 20:40.006
SOMETIMES BREAK THE LAW

20:40.039 --> 20:42.008
IN ORDER
TO BRING DOWN MAJOR CRIMINALS?

20:42.041 --> 20:42.975
- WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO.

20:43.009 --> 20:44.977
- BUT IT HAPPENS.

20:45.011 --> 20:48.881
FOR EXAMPLE, HAVE YOU EVER
PARTAKEN IN ILLEGAL DRUGS?

20:48.915 --> 20:50.883
- ONCE.

20:50.917 --> 20:53.019
I WAS NEW
TO A DRUG DEALER'S ORGANIZATION.

20:53.052 --> 20:54.321
I WAS BEING TESTED.

20:54.354 --> 20:56.456
IF I REFUSED,
I MIGHT HAVE BEEN SHOT.

20:56.489 --> 20:59.826
- SO A GOOD UNDERCOVER AGENT,
LIKE YOURSELF,

20:59.859 --> 21:02.762
FINDS WAYS
TO AVOID BREAKING THE LAW.

21:02.795 --> 21:04.631
- YES, THAT'S PROTOCOL.

21:04.664 --> 21:06.533
- NOW IF YOU WERE INFILTRATING
A NEW ORGANIZATION,

21:06.566 --> 21:08.034
YOU WOULD FIND WAYS

21:08.067 --> 21:11.704
TO AVOID INAPPROPRIATE
SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS?

21:11.738 --> 21:13.940
- YES.

21:13.973 --> 21:15.442
- ONLY IF YOUR LIFE
DEPENDED ON IT,

21:15.475 --> 21:17.510
WOULD YOU CROSS THAT LINE?

21:17.544 --> 21:20.012
- YES, BUT AGAIN, I CAN'T SPEAK
TO THE SPECIFICS OF ANOTHER--

21:20.046 --> 21:21.013
- THEN DON'T.

21:21.047 --> 21:22.949
LET'S KEEP THIS SIMPLE.

21:22.982 --> 21:26.018
DID YOU EVER HAVE INAPPROPRIATE
SEXUAL RELATIONSHIPS

21:26.052 --> 21:28.955
IN YOUR UNDERCOVER ROLE?

21:28.988 --> 21:31.090
- I NEVER SLEPT
WITH A COERCED PROSTITUTE.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.393
- DID YOU EVER SLEEP WITH ANYONE
UNDER FALSE PRETENSES?

21:33.426 --> 21:36.329
- YOUR HONOR,
THIS IS WAY OFF BASE.

21:36.363 --> 21:37.864
- MR. QUERNS,
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

21:37.897 --> 21:42.402
- ALMOST DONE,
YOUR HONOR.

21:45.838 --> 21:47.540
DETECTIVE, DO YOU RECOGNIZE

21:47.574 --> 21:48.975
THE WOMAN WHO JUST ENTERED
THE COURTROOM?

21:49.008 --> 21:50.109
- OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR.

21:50.142 --> 21:52.745
WE HAVE NO IDEA
WHO THIS WOMAN IS.

21:52.779 --> 21:55.782
- I BELIEVE DETECTIVE AMARO
CAN HELP US OUT WITH THAT.

21:55.815 --> 21:58.084
DETECTIVE, IS SHE THE SISTER
OF A DRUG KINGPIN

21:58.117 --> 22:00.387
WHOSE ORGANIZATION
YOU INFILTRATED?

22:00.420 --> 22:02.054
- OH, OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR.

22:02.088 --> 22:06.626
- HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW HER...
DETECTIVE?

22:09.028 --> 22:12.098
- I KNEW HER...

22:12.131 --> 22:13.132
VERY WELL.

22:13.165 --> 22:14.667
- OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR!

22:29.916 --> 22:30.383
.

22:30.417 --> 22:30.683
- CYNTHIA.

22:31.718 --> 22:32.985
HEY.
- WHAT?

22:33.019 --> 22:34.454
- WE SHOULD TALK.

22:34.487 --> 22:35.822
- AFTER TEN YEARS,
WE SHOULD TALK?

22:35.855 --> 22:38.625
ME AND YOU--
CARLOS FROM CARTAGENA? NO!

22:38.658 --> 22:40.527
- I COULDN'T TELL YOU
WHO I WAS THEN.

22:40.560 --> 22:43.029
- NO, YOU WERE A COP...
BRINGING DOWN MY BROTHER.

22:43.062 --> 22:44.731
HE GETS ARRESTED,
AND YOU DISAPPEARED.

22:44.764 --> 22:46.866
I THOUGHT YOU RAN BACK
TO COLOMBIA.

22:46.899 --> 22:48.935
THEN THIS MORNING, SOME--
SOME LAWYER SHOWS UP

22:48.968 --> 22:50.837
AND TELLS ME
WHO YOU REALLY ARE,

22:50.870 --> 22:52.071
DRAGS ME DOWN HERE.

22:52.104 --> 22:54.173
AND THERE YOU ARE
IN THAT SUIT!

22:54.206 --> 22:57.744
- I'M SORRY.

22:57.777 --> 22:59.145
- YOU'RE SCUM.

23:08.688 --> 23:10.790
- NICK, YOU OKAY?

23:10.823 --> 23:13.493
- YOUR BOYFRIEND
SANDBAGGED ME.

23:17.764 --> 23:19.732
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

23:19.766 --> 23:21.468
- DO YOU REALLY WANT
TO DO THIS IN HERE?

23:21.501 --> 23:22.735
- AND YOU'RE ACCUSED
OF RAPING A SEX SLAVE,

23:22.769 --> 23:24.637
SO YOU DRAG ME
THROUGH THE MUD?

23:24.671 --> 23:26.439
- IT WAS MY LAWYER'S CALL,
AND I DIDN'T RAPE ANYBODY.

23:26.473 --> 23:28.575
DID YOU?
- NOT EVEN CLOSE.

23:28.608 --> 23:31.043
ALL RIGHT, CYNTHIA AND I:
THAT WAS A RELATIONSHIP.

23:31.077 --> 23:33.513
- YEAH, LIKE ME AND CARISSA,
MR. HOLIER-THAN-THOU.

23:33.546 --> 23:34.781
- DID CARISSA KNOW
YOU WERE UNDERCOVER?

23:34.814 --> 23:35.948
- DID CYNTHIA?

23:35.982 --> 23:38.150
- HOW'D YOU EVEN FIND HER?

23:38.184 --> 23:41.153
- YOU AND ME: WE'RE BOTH
IN THE SAME SMALL WORLD.

23:41.187 --> 23:43.656
ONLY I MADE MORE FRIENDS
THAN YOU DID.

23:43.690 --> 23:44.791
- RIGHT, YOU MEAN
YOU LOOKED THE OTHER WAY

23:44.824 --> 23:46.025
WHEN COPS BENT THE RULES.

23:46.058 --> 23:47.494
- OH, PLEASE!

23:47.527 --> 23:48.728
SAYS THE MAN WHO SLEPT

23:48.761 --> 23:50.029
WITH THE SISTER
OF HIS TARGET

23:50.062 --> 23:51.498
TO MAKE HIS CASE?

23:51.531 --> 23:52.965
- IT WASN'T LIKE THAT!

23:52.999 --> 23:54.867
ALL RIGHT, SHE DOESN'T NEED
TO BE DRAGGED INTO THIS!

23:54.901 --> 23:56.869
- HEY, LOOK! I'M LOOKING
AT TEN YEARS IN JAIL, PAL!

23:56.903 --> 23:58.237
TEN!

23:58.270 --> 24:01.541
DESPERATE MEASURES!

24:09.916 --> 24:11.818
- DETECTIVE CASSIDY,

24:11.851 --> 24:13.853
HAVE YOU EVER HAD
SEXUAL RELATIONS

24:13.886 --> 24:15.822
WITH HEATHER RIGGS?

24:15.855 --> 24:17.256
- NO, I HAVE NOT.

24:17.289 --> 24:19.892
- WHAT KIND OF RELATIONS
DID YOU HAVE WITH HER?

24:19.926 --> 24:21.193
- I WAS WORKING AS A UC.

24:21.227 --> 24:22.729
AND MY NEXT TARGET

24:22.762 --> 24:24.631
WAS A TRAFFICKER
NAMED ANDRE LAROUCHE.

24:24.664 --> 24:27.199
HE OFFERED ME HER SERVICES
AT A PARTY.

24:27.233 --> 24:29.068
I THOUGHT IT WAS A TEST.

24:29.101 --> 24:30.937
- DID YOU TELL HIM
"NO, THANK YOU"?

24:30.970 --> 24:33.940
- NO. THAT WOULD HAVE SENT UP
A RED FLAG.

24:33.973 --> 24:35.642
SO I, UM...

24:35.675 --> 24:37.009
I TOOK HER INTO A BEDROOM.

24:37.043 --> 24:38.945
- WHAT HAPPENED IN THE BEDROOM?
- NOTHING HAPPENED.

24:38.978 --> 24:41.948
I TOLD HER I WAS FINISHING
A COURSE OF ANTIBIOTICS

24:41.981 --> 24:43.850
AND THAT SHE WOULDN'T WANT
TO CATCH WHAT I HAD.

24:43.883 --> 24:46.619
- WHY DID YOU KEEP HER
IN THE ROOM FOR TWO HOURS?

24:46.653 --> 24:48.855
- I WAS AFRAID
SHE'D GET BEATEN.

24:48.888 --> 24:49.956
AND SHE LOOKED REAL TIRED,

24:49.989 --> 24:51.190
AND I FELT
LIKE SHE NEEDED A BREAK,

24:51.223 --> 24:53.125
SO I GAVE HER ONE.

24:53.159 --> 24:54.861
- THANK YOU,
DETECTIVE CASSIDY.

24:54.894 --> 24:57.997
- UH, DETECTIVE CASSIDY,
YOU--

24:58.030 --> 24:59.699
OH, I'M SORRY,

24:59.732 --> 25:03.736
YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY
A DETECTIVE ANYMORE, ARE YOU?

25:03.770 --> 25:05.638
OFFICER CASSIDY.

25:05.672 --> 25:08.207
YOU EXPECT THE JURY
TO BELIEVE

25:08.240 --> 25:10.276
THAT YOU WERE OFFERED
AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN

25:10.309 --> 25:12.945
FOR NO-STRINGS SEX,

25:12.979 --> 25:15.648
AND YOU DECLINED?

25:15.682 --> 25:18.184
- I WASN'T THERE
TO HAVE SEX, COUNSELOR.

25:18.217 --> 25:19.852
I WAS WORKING.

25:19.886 --> 25:22.288
- BUT IN YOUR VERY NEXT
UNDERCOVER ASSIGNMENT,

25:22.321 --> 25:24.156
AGAINST MR. GANZEL,

25:24.190 --> 25:27.560
YOU DID HAVE SEX
WITH A PROSTITUTE--

25:27.594 --> 25:29.929
"CARISSA GIBSON"?

25:29.962 --> 25:32.198
- YEAH.
BUT WE WERE INVOLVED.

25:32.231 --> 25:34.033
AND, UH, WHATEVER SHE DID,

25:34.066 --> 25:35.568
SHE DID
OF HER OWN FREE WILL.

25:35.602 --> 25:37.003
- OH, SO THE SITUATION
WITH MS. RIGGS

25:37.036 --> 25:38.237
WAS DIFFERENT.

25:38.270 --> 25:39.972
- YEAH, SHE WASN'T THERE
BECAUSE SHE--

25:40.006 --> 25:41.774
- YOU KNEW THAT--
- SHE WASN'T THERE BECAUSE--

25:41.808 --> 25:43.843
- YOU KNEW THAT SHE WAS BEING
FORCIBLY COMPELLED

25:43.876 --> 25:45.044
TO HAVE SEX
AGAINST HER WILL?

25:45.077 --> 25:46.746
- IT SEEMED LIKELY, YET--

25:46.779 --> 25:48.080
- SO YOU KNEW
THAT IF YOU HAD SEX WITH HER,

25:48.114 --> 25:49.649
YOU WOULD BE GUILTY
OF RAPE?

25:49.682 --> 25:51.818
- OBJECTION.
CALLS FOR A LEGAL OPINION.

25:51.851 --> 25:53.085
- OVERRULED.

25:53.119 --> 25:54.654
THE WITNESS MAY ANSWER.

25:54.687 --> 25:56.789
- YEAH.
I MEAN, YES.

25:56.823 --> 25:58.658
BUT I DIDN'T
HAVE SEX WITH HER.

25:58.691 --> 26:00.960
- WHAT? DESPITE ALL EVIDENCE
TO THE CONTRARY?

26:00.993 --> 26:02.795
DESPITE HER TESTIMONY,
AND YOUR OWN ADMISSION

26:02.829 --> 26:05.131
THAT YOU SPENT TWO HOURS
ALONE WITH HER,

26:05.164 --> 26:06.699
YOUR ADMISSION
THAT YOU HAD SEX

26:06.733 --> 26:07.934
WITH ANOTHER PROSTITUTE?

26:07.967 --> 26:10.002
- OBJECTION!
ARGUMENTATIVE.

26:10.036 --> 26:11.070
- NEVER MIND.

26:11.103 --> 26:12.805
- NOT GOOD.

26:12.839 --> 26:17.209
- I'M DONE.

26:20.112 --> 26:22.982
- WELL, THAT WENT BADLY.

26:23.015 --> 26:24.116
- ISN'T THAT
A MATTER OF OPINION?

26:24.150 --> 26:25.818
- DID YOU WATCH THE JURY?

26:25.852 --> 26:27.319
THERE ARE TWO ELEMENTS
TO THIS CRIME:

26:27.353 --> 26:30.156
THE SEX AND THE KNOWLEDGE
THAT HEATHER WAS COERCED.

26:30.189 --> 26:32.358
YOU JUST CONFESSED
TO THE LATTER.

26:32.391 --> 26:33.993

TO, UM, BORROW HIM.

38:32.010 --> 38:34.880
- BE MY GUEST.

38:34.913 --> 38:36.948
- YOU SET ME UP, MAN.
THIS IS PAYBACK, RIGHT?

38:36.982 --> 38:38.917
- COME ON.
$10,000 CASH, MIDNIGHT.

38:38.950 --> 38:40.986
YOU'RE MEETING A MAN WITH
A TRUNK FULL OF STOLEN MEDS.

38:41.019 --> 38:42.854
- SOMEBODY ELSE IS GONNA
BE TEACHING THOSE GIRLS

38:42.888 --> 38:45.857
HOW TO POLE DANCE
FOR THE NEXT 20 YEARS.

38:45.891 --> 38:47.125
- THAT'S WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT?

38:47.158 --> 38:48.760
WHAT HEATHER SAID
ABOUT THAT COP?

38:48.794 --> 38:51.963
- WHY? YOU KNOW
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT?

38:53.899 --> 38:55.901
- I'M GUESSING
IT'S DEAL TIME.

38:55.934 --> 38:58.770
- DEPENDS ON WHAT
YOU GOT TO SAY.

39:01.607 --> 39:02.841
- [sighs]

39:02.874 --> 39:05.010
OKAY, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

39:05.043 --> 39:08.013
HEATHER AND I
MADE IT UP TO CASH IN.

39:09.881 --> 39:11.883
- WHAT DIDN'T HAPPEN?

39:11.917 --> 39:15.554
- HE DIDN'T RAPE HER.
HE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

39:15.587 --> 39:17.556
GANZEL DIDN'T GIVE ME THE MONEY,
BUT HE TOLD ME ABOUT THE SCAR.

39:17.589 --> 39:18.990
HE SAID IT WOULD
HELP HEATHER'S CASE.

39:19.024 --> 39:24.730
WE WERE GONNA SUE THE CITY.
MAKE A MILLION DOLLARS.

39:24.763 --> 39:27.032
- IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED,
HEATHER?

39:27.065 --> 39:29.735
IS THAT THE TRUTH?
- HOW MUCH TROUBLE AM I IN?

39:29.768 --> 39:31.903
- THAT'S NOT UP TO ME.

39:31.937 --> 39:37.576
BUT I NEED YOU TO TELL ME,
IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED?

39:37.609 --> 39:40.746
- YOU KNOW CASSIDY?

39:40.779 --> 39:43.615
- YEAH.

39:43.649 --> 39:46.752
I DO.

39:52.858 --> 39:55.861
- HE DIDN'T TOUCH ME.

40:00.632 --> 40:02.934
WE JUST TALKED.

40:02.968 --> 40:06.071
ABOUT DOGS.

40:06.104 --> 40:09.074
- HEATHER...

40:09.107 --> 40:13.945
I NEED TO KNOW IF ANYBODY ELSE
CAN VERIFY THIS VERSION

40:13.979 --> 40:16.915
OF YOUR STORY.

40:16.948 --> 40:18.584
- YES.

40:18.617 --> 40:22.754
YES, LATER THAT NIGHT,
I TOLD ANOTHER ONE OF THE GIRLS

40:22.788 --> 40:26.825
HOW HE DIDN'T MAKE ME--

40:26.858 --> 40:30.095
[crying]
HOW NICE HE WAS TO ME.

40:35.967 --> 40:38.904
- HEY.
- HEY.

40:38.937 --> 40:41.607
OUR LITTLE PRICK D.A.--
HE INTERVIEWED HEATHER,

40:41.640 --> 40:43.575
HEATHER'S BOYFRIEND NAVARRO,
ALSO HEATHER'S FRIEND

40:43.609 --> 40:44.876
THAT WAS THERE THAT NIGHT.

40:44.910 --> 40:46.011
HE DROPPED THE CHARGE.

40:46.044 --> 40:47.546
- SO YOU'RE FREE.

40:47.579 --> 40:49.581
- YEAH, I'M FREE
TO WORK THE NIGHT SHIFT

40:49.615 --> 40:52.017
AT BRONX COURTHOUSE.
COME ON.

40:52.050 --> 40:53.852
I THINK I'M JUST
GONNA STICK IT OUT.

40:53.885 --> 40:55.587
I'M GONNA GET MY 20.

40:55.621 --> 40:59.090
I'M DAMAGED GOODS, LIV.
- BRIAN, YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

40:59.124 --> 41:02.093
- ONCE ACCUSED,
ALWAYS UNDER SUSPICION.

41:02.127 --> 41:05.030
EVEN FROM YOU.

41:05.063 --> 41:08.567
- FROM ME?

41:08.600 --> 41:10.268
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I BELIEVED YOU.

41:10.301 --> 41:13.905
- I WISH I COULD
BELIEVE THAT.

41:13.939 --> 41:16.241
- BRIAN, COME ON,
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

41:16.274 --> 41:17.809
OH, WHAT?
SO WE'RE OVER NOW?

41:17.843 --> 41:20.712
- I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW.

41:24.082 --> 41:28.587
YOU WANT TO GO GET A DRINK
SOMEWHERE AND NOT TALK ABOUT IT?
