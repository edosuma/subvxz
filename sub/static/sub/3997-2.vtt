WEBVTT

00:02.533 --> 00:04.532
Well, it took a year,

00:04.533 --> 00:05.586
she's finally cooking
and cleaning.

00:05.587 --> 00:07.556
I knew this would pay off
eventually.

00:07.557 --> 00:08.558
Does everybody like egg pie?

00:08.559 --> 00:10.516
Jess, I believe the word that

00:10.517 --> 00:12.545
you're looking for is
"frittata."

00:12.546 --> 00:16.524
Oh, Schmidt, stop staring
at my fritta-tas!

00:16.525 --> 00:18.516
You gotta do
something, Nick.

00:18.517 --> 00:19.554
My sister's coming,
my mother's coming.

00:19.555 --> 00:22.532
I love being unemployed.
I love it!

00:22.533 --> 00:24.537
If I'd lost my job
a week ago,

00:24.538 --> 00:28.512
- I'd be deep in a porn hole by now.
- Five-second rule.

00:28.515 --> 00:31.516
The images, the things I would
have seen by now. It's...

00:31.517 --> 00:32.515
Jess, are you cooking

00:32.516 --> 00:34.596
a frittata in a saucepan?
What is this, prison?

00:34.597 --> 00:36.517
- Jar.
- Jar. That's a jar for sure.

00:36.520 --> 00:37.557
Yeah, I know.

00:37.558 --> 00:39.520
I already got the money ready.

00:39.521 --> 00:40.578
No!

00:40.579 --> 00:43.500
- What? Oh, no!
- Damn it!

00:43.503 --> 00:44.499
No!

00:44.500 --> 00:48.507
Jess! What is this?!

00:48.508 --> 00:50.092
I just finished that last night.
Isn't it great?

00:50.093 --> 00:51.499
Felt art?

00:51.500 --> 00:52.521
- Nick?
- I'm on it.

00:52.524 --> 00:53.541
What?

00:53.542 --> 00:55.531
What photograph were you working from?
My hair hasn't

00:55.532 --> 00:56.560
looked like that in three weeks.

00:56.561 --> 00:58.515
Your hair looks just
like that, Schmidt.

00:58.516 --> 00:59.519
Yeah, your hair looks
just like that.

00:59.520 --> 01:00.544
You are perfect
in that.

01:00.545 --> 01:01.571
This is making me furious.

01:01.572 --> 01:03.507
It's multi-cloth
collage.

01:03.508 --> 01:04.516
Insane!

01:04.516 --> 01:06.587
Jess, can I have
a word with you?

01:06.588 --> 01:08.499
Take a break!

01:08.500 --> 01:10.524
You're looking at this
the wrong way.

01:10.525 --> 01:11.594
This is the first time

01:11.595 --> 01:13.575
you don't have to be anywhere
or do anything.

01:13.576 --> 01:14.557
Right.

01:14.558 --> 01:16.503
You could make weird art

01:19.542 --> 01:22.574
You could go off the grid.
You could be an outlaw.

01:22.575 --> 01:25.591
I'm not really someone who goes
off the grid, Nick.

01:25.592 --> 01:29.553
Whoo-hoo!
I'm off the grid!

01:29.554 --> 01:33.557
I'm so far off the grid, that
everybody's all, "She's off the grid!"

01:33.558 --> 01:36.503
And then I'm all,
"I don't play by your rules."

01:36.504 --> 01:39.511
I can drink at 11:00... a.m.

01:39.512 --> 01:40.583
Yeah, that backfired
pretty quickly.

01:40.584 --> 01:42.503
High five.

01:42.504 --> 01:44.541
♪ Who's that girl? ♪

01:44.542 --> 01:46.562

My mom always said
I was a late bloomer.

01:55.522 --> 01:57.595
Wait till she sees
this mustache! Bam!

01:57.596 --> 01:59.542
- That's not a shadow?
- What?

01:59.543 --> 02:01.571
'Cause your nose makes
a shadow right over your...

02:01.572 --> 02:04.507
Oh, now it is a mustache.
You look adorable.

02:04.508 --> 02:07.507
Winston, I need you
to be honest with me, okay?

02:07.508 --> 02:08.588
- Yeah.
- Does your mother not like me?

02:10.390 --> 02:11.287
Yes.

02:11.288 --> 02:13.499
She does, she does
not like me?

02:13.500 --> 02:15.528
Schmidt, she loves you.

02:15.529 --> 02:16.594
Good, good, because, you know,

02:16.595 --> 02:18.523
historically speaking,
I'm like, catnip

02:18.524 --> 02:20.088
to tough-talking
African-American women.

02:20.589 --> 02:22.541
It's 'cause I don't front,
know what I mean?

02:22.542 --> 02:23.557
Don't do that.

02:23.558 --> 02:24.545
A'ight.

02:25.046 --> 02:27.082
What is that?

02:27.083 --> 02:29.045
What's your name?

02:29.046 --> 02:31.020
I'm Nick.

02:31.021 --> 02:32.067
Nick's name is Nick!

02:32.068 --> 02:34.017
- Nick, meet Nick.
- Hi, Nick.

02:34.018 --> 02:35.067
You guys even look alike.

02:35.068 --> 02:37.053
Look at that
turtle face.

02:37.054 --> 02:39.017
Nick, want these kegs
behind the bar?

02:39.018 --> 02:40.000
- Yes.
- Yes.

02:40.003 --> 02:42.025
- He was talking to me.
- He was talking to you.

02:42.028 --> 02:44.083
Andy, I'll go get
your check, bud.

02:45.500 --> 02:47.503
Oh, hey, Winston, you know,
you can just have

02:47.504 --> 02:49.383
the hummus in there, okay?
It's giving me the toots.

02:50.584 --> 02:51.591
Hey, Schmidt.

02:51.592 --> 02:52.537
Hey, Alisha.

02:53.538 --> 02:54.583
You look great.
Wow.

02:54.584 --> 02:55.537
Thanks.

02:55.538 --> 02:57.542
It's like they stretched
the ugly out of Winston.

02:57.543 --> 02:58.541
Hmm.

02:58.542 --> 02:59.523
How's the hoops?

02:59.524 --> 03:00.567
- Good, it's good.
- Yeah?

03:00.570 --> 03:02.499
Very impressive, pro ball.

03:02.500 --> 03:05.529
I mean, women's pro,
but still. Swoosh.

03:07.071 --> 03:11.082
I was working in real estate,
but I got laid off, so...

03:11.083 --> 03:12.999
I got laid off last week!

03:13.000 --> 03:14.050
I don't even know
what to do with myself.

03:14.051 --> 03:17.078
I just told myself it was a
chance to start over.

03:17.079 --> 03:19.029
- Yes.
- Be someone

03:19.030 --> 03:20.092
That I've always wanted

03:20.093 --> 03:22.092
- to be, you know?
- I'm Jess.

03:22.095 --> 03:24.024
Hi. How are ya?

03:24.025 --> 03:25.078
I'm Bearclaw!

03:25.079 --> 03:27.082
Bearclaw helps me
with the deliveries.

03:27.083 --> 03:28.082
Hey.

03:28.083 --> 03:30.067
- Here's your check, my man.
- Thanks, man.

03:30.070 --> 03:34.070
Maybe I'll see you around.
I'm in the phone booth.

03:34.071 --> 03:37.078
Um, oh, it was nice
to meet you, Jess.

03:37.079 --> 03:39.096
- Nice meeting you, too.
- And, Jess, you met me.

03:39.099 --> 03:42.000
Nice to meet you both.

03:43.058 --> 03:47.070
Hey, Nick, I know what I'm gonna
do with all my free time.

03:47.071 --> 03:49.021
- Him.
- You like him?

03:49.024 --> 03:52.011
Mother, may I? Can you give him
my phone number?

03:52.012 --> 03:53.079
Yeah, absolutely.

03:55.042 --> 03:57.053
Winston, your sister
got so hot.

03:57.054 --> 03:59.074
I'm gonna have
to Shaq attack her.

03:59.075 --> 04:01.071
- Schmidt.
- May I have your blessing? 'Cause I'm gonna be,

04:01.072 --> 04:02.083
- Like, dribbling up the court.
- Schmidt.

04:02.086 --> 04:04.032
Boom. Technical foul.

04:04.033 --> 04:07.082
Boom. Illegal use
of the hands. Boom.

04:07.083 --> 04:10.050
- Hello, Schmidt.
- Charmaine.

04:11.096 --> 04:12.999
Charmaine!

04:13.000 --> 04:14.027
The loft just became

04:14.028 --> 04:15.054
Big Mama's House!

04:17.021 --> 04:20.004
- Give me a hug.
- You gonna take care of this?

04:20.005 --> 04:21.091
- He's dead to me.
- Okay.

04:24.088 --> 04:27.087
Hi. Excuse me.
Are you Katie?

04:27.088 --> 04:29.032
I'm Sam from Cupid Match.

04:29.033 --> 04:33.078
And I'm the girl from my dreams
of you.

04:33.079 --> 04:35.016
You are Katie, right?

04:35.017 --> 04:36.079
- Yeah.
- Finally.

04:36.082 --> 04:38.057
I am.
I'm Katie. Hi.

04:38.058 --> 04:41.074
Hi. So many e-mails
back and forth.

04:41.075 --> 04:43.061
How's the little
dog of yours?

04:43.062 --> 04:47.070
I had to put her-im down
on the way here.

04:47.071 --> 04:49.058
- Oh, my God!
- I know.

04:49.061 --> 04:51.066
Can I tell you
something?

04:51.067 --> 04:52.071
Uh, not really.

04:52.072 --> 04:56.061
I'm you from
the future.

04:56.062 --> 04:58.082
Well, that's a first.

04:58.083 --> 05:01.087
Nick, I traveled from
the future to find you.

05:01.088 --> 05:03.016
I'm a time traveler.

05:03.017 --> 05:04.071
Does everybody
tip badly in the future,

05:04.072 --> 05:06.091
or is it just you?

05:06.092 --> 05:08.048
You don't believe
I'm you, do you?

05:08.049 --> 05:09.071
Absolutely not.

05:09.072 --> 05:11.074
Well, I know you didn't
shower this morning.

05:11.075 --> 05:13.033
Well, good guess.
It's a Wednesday.

05:13.034 --> 05:15.053
I know a girl
broke your heart and

05:15.054 --> 05:16.077
you gave up on love.

05:16.078 --> 05:18.083
I know sometimes you get
mad and you don't know why.

05:19.084 --> 05:20.999
I know you're
a bartender

05:21.000 --> 05:23.074
because you like
three feet of bar

05:23.075 --> 05:26.061
between you and
everyone you meet.

05:26.062 --> 05:28.075
Well, I mean...

05:32.525 --> 05:35.054
Chew on that,
you clown.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.003
Wait. Hey, don't-don't say
all that weird stuff

05:39.004 --> 05:40.083
and then just leave!

05:40.084 --> 05:42.049
You were wrong
about the bar!

05:42.050 --> 05:44.083
But everything else was right.

05:49.025 --> 05:52.066
What was the band
that we...? I know...

05:52.067 --> 05:54.007
I'm in.

05:54.008 --> 05:57.066
I've been to
48 Creed shows, so...

05:57.067 --> 05:59.045
Forty-two.

05:59.046 --> 06:01.050
- No way!
- Way!

06:01.053 --> 06:04.075
- Are you serious?
- Wow!

06:04.078 --> 06:07.032
Way to go, Cupid Match.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.083
Yeah. Hey, hold still.

06:08.084 --> 06:11.074
You got a little hair...

06:12.075 --> 06:14.038
on your nose.

06:16.000 --> 06:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:27.517 --> 06:30.053
Let's just say,
hypothetically,

06:30.054 --> 06:32.071
we live in a world where
time travel exists, okay?

06:32.072 --> 06:35.066
So if that is
the case...

06:35.067 --> 06:37.074
One, Marie Antoinette.
Two, Cleopatra.

06:37.075 --> 06:39.053
Three,
young Ann-Margret.

06:39.054 --> 06:41.049
Four, old Ann-Margret.

06:41.050 --> 06:43.071
Would you shut up, you clown?!
I'm being serious!

06:43.072 --> 06:46.028
I'm talking about real time
travel here, Schmidty.

06:46.029 --> 06:48.032
And I made an astute observation
off of that.

06:48.033 --> 06:49.046
I might have met
future me.

06:49.047 --> 06:51.003
Who knows about this?

06:51.004 --> 06:53.050
Nobody. You're the first
person I've told, obviously.

06:53.051 --> 06:54.079
- Whoa.
- If I find out how you die,

06:54.082 --> 06:55.999
Do you want me
to tell you?

06:56.000 --> 06:57.079
Don't worry. I already know.
It's one of these moles.

06:57.080 --> 07:00.088
- See this little S.O.B. right there?
- That's the guy?

07:00.091 --> 07:02.016
I've been eyeing him
for a while.

07:02.017 --> 07:03.073
That's one's gonna turn
green one day,

07:03.074 --> 07:05.036
and then
there you go.

07:05.037 --> 07:06.071
Schmidt's dead.

07:06.072 --> 07:09.053
I met me in my bar!

07:09.054 --> 07:12.032
Ask him when I meet Kanye.
'Cause I vision...

07:12.033 --> 07:13.077
I'm talking about
real time travel.

07:13.078 --> 07:15.073
I have visions
of me, Kanye, Beyoncé...

07:15.074 --> 07:16.079
I could figure out
what happened...!

07:16.080 --> 07:20.012
- Hey, can I talk to you guys?
- What's up, baby?

07:20.013 --> 07:21.038
Don't call me baby.
Seriously, stop.

07:21.039 --> 07:24.062
Come on, spill. - Don't wink at me.
What?

07:24.065 --> 07:27.049
Okay, look, I had the best
sex of my life last night.

07:27.050 --> 07:29.031
He brewed me like
a fine chamomile.

07:29.032 --> 07:30.071
Oh, so that was you.

07:30.072 --> 07:32.071
I thought that was
a couple bums fighting.

07:32.072 --> 07:34.071
It wasn't.. It was me having sex.

07:34.072 --> 07:36.054
- Mm. - I left my body, went up to heaven,
saw my grandparents,

07:36.055 --> 07:38.038
Thought it was weird that
I saw my grandparents,

07:38.039 --> 07:41.016
came back down, I became a
werewolf, I scared some teenagers.

07:41.017 --> 07:43.037
I came back into my body.
Only thing is,

07:43.038 --> 07:45.082
he thinks my name is Katie.

07:45.083 --> 07:47.070
And that I'm
a dancer

07:47.071 --> 07:49.074
and/or something
involving puppets.

07:49.075 --> 07:50.060
Katie?

07:50.061 --> 07:51.071
Hey, Sam.

07:51.072 --> 07:55.067
- These are my roommates.
- Hey.

07:55.068 --> 07:57.096
- Hey, uh, Katie, we're running late for dance rehearsal.
- Yes. Oh.

07:57.097 --> 07:59.083
We're wondering if we're
doing leg warmers today...

07:59.084 --> 08:01.062
- Leg warmers.
- Oh, we are. Leg warmers?

08:01.063 --> 08:02.075
You guys are dancers, too?

08:02.076 --> 08:04.079
- Yeah, I mean, mostly Katie,
- Yes, yes.

08:04.082 --> 08:06.071
- But yeah.
- What, do we not look like dancers?

08:06.074 --> 08:08.092
- No, I mean...
- This one's a leaper.

08:08.095 --> 08:10.079
- No, I knew he was gonna go there.
- You're a leaper. You are.

08:10.082 --> 08:12.095
Yep. He is.
They call him, uh, Cricket.

08:12.096 --> 08:14.067
- Yeah, Cricket the leaper.
- Let me see you leap.

08:14.070 --> 08:16.054
- Cricket, show him how you leap.
- I'd love to see you leap.

08:16.055 --> 08:18.017
Don't get self-conscious now.
You've got this.

08:18.018 --> 08:19.071
- You've got it.
- You're really

08:19.072 --> 08:21.019
getting a show here,
'cause he normally

08:21.020 --> 08:22.096
doesn't do this
for a private audience.

08:22.097 --> 08:24.062
- Do the tribal stuff.
- All right. Yeah.

08:26.012 --> 08:28.079
- Beautiful.
- Is he okay?

08:28.082 --> 08:30.016
I'm kind of hearing
some popping.

08:30.017 --> 08:32.028
No, no, Look at that vert.

08:32.029 --> 08:33.049
- Breathtaking.
- Faster. Faster.

08:33.051 --> 08:34.092
Grasshopper.

08:34.092 --> 08:36.057
And I'm done.

08:36.058 --> 08:37.094
All right, you know what?
I'm gonna go

08:37.095 --> 08:39.058
to a couple brunches,
maybe take a nap,

08:39.058 --> 08:40.999
rehydrate. Come here.

08:43.004 --> 08:44.048
This is so normal.

08:44.049 --> 08:45.075
This isn't upsetting at all.

08:45.076 --> 08:47.057
Yah!

08:47.058 --> 08:49.092
Oh, man.

08:49.093 --> 08:51.050
All right,
I'm gonna text you later.

08:51.051 --> 08:52.071
- Yep.
- And if you

08:52.072 --> 08:53.096
find my underwear just, uh...

08:53.097 --> 08:55.028
keep it.

08:55.029 --> 08:56.096
I got to go.

08:59.088 --> 09:02.037
Wow, Katie's an animal.

09:02.038 --> 09:04.046
- Katie's the best.
- Nice.

09:04.049 --> 09:06.066
I love being Katie.

09:06.067 --> 09:08.062
- Vintage Katie.
- Like an animal you are.

09:08.065 --> 09:11.091
Katie knows how the sausage
gets made.

09:11.092 --> 09:13.042
- Ew.
- Katie...

09:13.045 --> 09:16.053
Has a job, y'all.

09:16.054 --> 09:18.061
I think I should
just stay Katie.

09:18.062 --> 09:20.061
Maybe you should
watch a cautionary tale

09:20.062 --> 09:22.082
that I like to call
The Nutty Professor.

09:22.083 --> 09:24.037
What's Katie gonna do, Nick?

09:24.038 --> 09:26.053
She's got
some pretty dark needs.

09:26.054 --> 09:29.020
Well, I hope you don't like him,
'cause you're not coming back

09:29.021 --> 09:31.017
from, "Just kidding.
My name is actually Jess."

09:35.029 --> 09:37.038
"Hey, I got your number
from Nick. Want to hang?"

09:37.039 --> 09:39.012
- What's this?
- I gave your number

09:39.015 --> 09:42.007
To the guy that you like
from the bar. You asked me to.

09:42.008 --> 09:43.053
Oh, my God.

09:43.054 --> 09:44.087
I forgot.

09:44.088 --> 09:46.999
I've never had two guys
into me before.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.029
- What's happening?
- Jess, I'm gonna tell you what's happening.

09:49.032 --> 09:51.041
Okay, there comes a time

09:51.042 --> 09:53.045
in every person's
life when...

09:53.046 --> 09:55.061
for no reason whatsoever

09:55.062 --> 09:57.027
they are irresistible
to the opposite sex.

09:57.028 --> 09:58.088
For me, it was
the third night

09:58.089 --> 10:00.078
of Hanukkah '96,

10:00.079 --> 10:03.053
which I like to refer to as
The Night of the Shoshannas.

10:03.054 --> 10:05.054
For me, it's every time
I Jet Ski.

10:06.050 --> 10:07.042
This is not fair.

10:07.043 --> 10:09.045
It is gonna take
all of my game

10:09.046 --> 10:11.033
- to sleep with Winston's sister.
- What?

10:11.036 --> 10:12.054
- What?
- And then there's you,

10:12.057 --> 10:14.045
Who has this raw
animal magnetism

10:14.046 --> 10:16.007
just dropped in her lap

10:16.008 --> 10:18.049
like a sack of taters.
What a waste.

10:18.050 --> 10:21.096
- I'm pretty sure it is not a waste.
- Oh, it's a waste.

10:21.097 --> 10:23.046
Jess, look, you
don't have the skill

10:23.047 --> 10:24.049
to juggle men.

10:24.050 --> 10:25.067
You wear a cardigan

10:25.068 --> 10:27.032
on top of another cardigan.

10:27.033 --> 10:28.092
We all know you're not
the best with doorknobs.

10:28.093 --> 10:31.028
You can barely hold
one thing in each hand.

10:31.029 --> 10:33.025
You tripped the other day
just standing there.

10:33.026 --> 10:35.024
What's happening?

10:35.025 --> 10:38.061
Okay, but Katie
can juggle men.

10:38.062 --> 10:41.024
She's out the door
before you even know

10:41.025 --> 10:42.067
your wallet's gone, son.

10:42.068 --> 10:44.033
Ooh.

10:44.036 --> 10:46.053
He wants to cook for me.

10:46.054 --> 10:48.020
Is there a hot way of saying

10:48.021 --> 10:50.079
I don't feel sexy after
I've had a lot of cheese?

10:50.080 --> 10:52.053
I would say no.

10:52.054 --> 10:54.070
Didn't know

10:54.071 --> 10:56.038
this was a butter knife
type of place.

10:56.039 --> 10:58.087
Don't worry,
the team's paying.

10:58.088 --> 11:02.020
If anybody asks,
you're the ball boy.

11:02.021 --> 11:04.049
Hey, Coach, put me in.

11:04.050 --> 11:07.000
- Schmidt.
- Schmidt, what the hell are you doing here?

11:07.003 --> 11:09.007
Come on, move over.
Hey, y'all.

11:09.008 --> 11:10.096
Everybody scooch,
a little scoochie down.

11:10.097 --> 11:12.075
- Okay, teamwork. Defense.
- Really?

11:12.078 --> 11:14.007
A lot of money that I want

11:14.008 --> 11:16.045
to deposit
into your Tyra Banks.

11:16.046 --> 11:18.049
If he touches your sister,

11:18.050 --> 11:20.066
I'm gonna stop paying
your cell phone bill.

11:20.067 --> 11:22.053
The L.A. Sparks.

11:22.054 --> 11:23.999
So many Sparks in one place,

11:24.000 --> 11:25.054
you're about to start
the world's sexiest fire.

11:25.055 --> 11:26.999
Am I right?

11:27.000 --> 11:28.067
Andy and I have been

11:28.068 --> 11:30.087
sending each other some
pretty dirty texts.

11:30.088 --> 11:32.046
Come to the professor.
Let me see.

11:32.047 --> 11:34.074
He says, "Can't stop thinking"

11:34.075 --> 11:36.071
about what you're gonna
wear tonight."

11:36.072 --> 11:38.024
How do I respond?

11:38.025 --> 11:40.038
- With a simple...
- Mm-hmm.

11:40.039 --> 11:41.029
"Or not wear."

11:41.030 --> 11:42.071
- Okay.
- Okay?

11:42.074 --> 11:44.049
"Or not wear

11:44.050 --> 11:47.032
because sex happens naked."

11:47.033 --> 11:49.024
Send.

11:49.025 --> 11:50.088
Okay, let me help
you with that.

11:50.089 --> 11:52.032
"Just kidding.

11:52.033 --> 11:55.003
Get ready for a night
you will never forget."

11:55.004 --> 11:56.037
Okay?

11:56.038 --> 11:58.066
"Because once you see my body,

11:58.067 --> 12:00.042
you will go brain-dead
and have memory loss."

12:00.043 --> 12:01.074
Send.

12:01.075 --> 12:03.016
Oh, no.

12:03.017 --> 12:05.057
Autocorrect changed "body"
to "meat bar."

12:12.067 --> 12:14.024
Bearclaw, what are you...

12:14.025 --> 12:15.074
Yeah!

12:15.075 --> 12:17.078
Oh, you're so hot.

12:17.079 --> 12:20.053
Come here.

12:20.054 --> 12:23.067
I can't
wait to see your meat bar.

12:26.508 --> 12:29.020
That's why
they call me Bearclaw.

12:29.021 --> 12:31.020
You did that yourself
in middle school.

12:31.021 --> 12:33.025
See now it's retracting
its claws.

12:33.026 --> 12:35.074
Now it's contracting
its claws.

12:35.075 --> 12:38.095
Like, "Rrr, I'm gonna
attack you in the wild."

12:38.096 --> 12:40.025
Oh, my God, phone's ringing.

12:40.028 --> 12:41.054
- Oh.
- Got to take this.

12:41.055 --> 12:42.092
I'm so sorry, it...

12:42.093 --> 12:44.038
- No, no, no, I...
- It's very important.

12:44.039 --> 12:45.031
I'll just be cooking.

12:45.032 --> 12:46.075
I love cooking.

12:46.076 --> 12:49.053
It's my only outlet.

12:49.054 --> 12:51.011
Nick, Nick.

12:51.012 --> 12:53.070
You gave my number
to the wrong guy.

12:53.071 --> 12:56.029
- Wait, which one did you want me to give your number to?
- Andy.

12:56.032 --> 12:58.082
Andy is so boring.

12:58.083 --> 13:01.020
Bearclaw just told me a
ten minute joke about squirrels

13:01.021 --> 13:03.037
with the punch line,
"eat these nuts."

13:03.038 --> 13:05.053
Seriously, he is so awesome.

13:05.054 --> 13:07.031
Nick, I don't want
to hurt his feelings.

13:07.032 --> 13:08.083
Tell me what to do

13:08.084 --> 13:11.011
because you got me into
this mess; this is your fault.

13:11.012 --> 13:13.016
This is not my fault.
I just wanted you

13:13.017 --> 13:15.041
to stop cleaning
the kitchen so much, Jess.

13:15.042 --> 13:17.092
Oh, my God.

13:17.095 --> 13:19.037
Who's Katie?

13:19.038 --> 13:21.016
I'm Katie.

13:21.017 --> 13:23.071
What is happening?

13:25.033 --> 13:28.033
- Hey, mama bear.
- Hey.

13:28.036 --> 13:29.061
Yeah.

13:29.062 --> 13:30.092
Can I tell you some... thing?

13:30.093 --> 13:31.095
Me first.

13:31.096 --> 13:33.049
Um, when Nick...

13:33.050 --> 13:36.032
When Nick told me
that you wanted my number,

13:36.033 --> 13:37.067
I was all like...

13:39.033 --> 13:40.092
And then I was like,

13:40.093 --> 13:42.999
Nick, this might be
the best thing

13:43.000 --> 13:45.032
that ever happened to me.

13:45.033 --> 13:46.095
Now you go.

13:46.096 --> 13:48.049
Um...

13:48.050 --> 13:52.000
what I was gonna say was, um...

13:54.012 --> 13:56.016
You're...

13:56.017 --> 13:58.028
an old soul.

13:58.029 --> 13:59.054
Hey, I wanted...

13:59.055 --> 14:01.041
I wanted to tell you.

14:01.042 --> 14:03.037
When I, uh,

14:03.038 --> 14:05.003
I got your text from before,

14:05.004 --> 14:08.999
and I have figured out
my sex character.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.096
And it's
Sergeant Giddyap Carruthers.

14:15.058 --> 14:17.017
Hey, if we...
if we make love later,

14:17.018 --> 14:21.057
and I tell you to pretend
that I'm a scary ghost,

14:22.058 --> 14:24.041
are you gonna be
weirded out by that?

14:24.042 --> 14:26.074
Bearclaw, I'm sick.

14:26.075 --> 14:28.003
Oh.

14:28.004 --> 14:30.050
- In my... face.
- Oh, no, um,

14:30.053 --> 14:32.057
I've got an anal thermometer
in my bag.

14:32.058 --> 14:34.021
I'm really good
at telling myself,

14:34.022 --> 14:36.082
and I think that I'm...
I feel very feverish.

14:36.083 --> 14:38.096
- I don't think I need the thermometer.
- Oh, yeah.

14:38.099 --> 14:39.999
No, you do feel hot.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.070
Yeah.

14:41.071 --> 14:44.041
Now you feel even hotter.

14:44.042 --> 14:46.028
Alisha, have a drink with me.

14:46.029 --> 14:48.011
Schmidt,

14:48.012 --> 14:50.082
I only go out with guys
who play basketball.

14:50.083 --> 14:52.011
Well, let's play for it.

14:52.012 --> 14:53.058
I win,
you have a drink with me.

14:53.059 --> 14:55.011
You win,
I take you to brunch.

14:55.012 --> 14:56.082
Shoot me.

14:56.083 --> 14:59.024
Schmidt, I'm a professional
basketball player.

14:59.025 --> 15:01.999
Yeah, and I'm a guy who works in
marketing that wants to give it to you.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.086
We both have jobs;
Get over it.

15:03.087 --> 15:05.038
Do I ever finish writing
my zombie book?

15:05.039 --> 15:07.007
Z is for Zombie?

15:07.008 --> 15:09.020
Great title.

15:09.021 --> 15:11.016
Do we ever get rich and famous?

15:11.017 --> 15:13.024
Three words:

15:13.025 --> 15:16.024
Hot, air, balloon.

15:16.025 --> 15:18.016
Do we invent them?

15:18.017 --> 15:20.075
No, they've been invented.

15:21.267 --> 15:22.266
Jess or Katie?

15:22.267 --> 15:23.275
Not now, Nicks.

15:23.276 --> 15:26.270
Hey, tell her you're sorry.

15:26.271 --> 15:27.329
- What for?
- You'll find out.

15:27.332 --> 15:30.253
I mean, I'm sure I did
something stupid,

15:30.254 --> 15:31.279
but what did I do?

15:31.280 --> 15:33.274
You just tell her
you're sorry.

15:33.275 --> 15:34.269
What did I do?

15:34.270 --> 15:35.312
You did something stupid.

15:35.313 --> 15:37.249
So tell her you're sorry.

15:37.250 --> 15:39.261
Now I know why people
get annoyed with me.

15:39.262 --> 15:40.283
It's hard to talk to us.

15:45.275 --> 15:47.311
Hey, you know, I can't
believe she asked Nick

15:47.312 --> 15:49.320
for your number and then...

15:49.321 --> 15:51.253
Yeah, yeah, you know what, man?

15:51.254 --> 15:52.346
We-We're perfect together.

15:52.347 --> 15:55.345
It's like I finally found
my lady bear.

15:55.346 --> 15:57.345
See, I felt like we
had a connection, too.

15:57.346 --> 16:00.295
You know, I don't know if you
ever get that feeling like,

16:00.296 --> 16:02.312
I don't know, like maybe
I could marry this woman.

16:02.313 --> 16:04.270
Oh, God.

16:04.271 --> 16:06.338
Is there a woman in that bathroom

16:06.341 --> 16:08.257
being harmed?

16:08.258 --> 16:09.291
No.

16:09.292 --> 16:11.269
I don't buy it.
Get out of the way.

16:11.270 --> 16:12.338
I was trained for this.

16:14.296 --> 16:16.262
Now you're gonna get
the Bearcl...

16:16.263 --> 16:17.274
Jess?

16:17.275 --> 16:18.274
Hi, Bearclaw.

16:18.275 --> 16:19.296
I thought you were sick.

16:19.297 --> 16:21.307
I'm feeling better.

16:21.308 --> 16:23.282
Why are you... if you're sick,

16:23.283 --> 16:27.274
why are nothing
but your breasts covered, Jess?

16:27.275 --> 16:29.303
Are you a doctor, is that why?

16:29.304 --> 16:31.316
Are you a doc... is he a doctor?

16:31.317 --> 16:33.296
- Do you know these guys, Katie?
- Who's Katie?

16:33.299 --> 16:35.337
What is going on in... Jess?

16:35.338 --> 16:37.338
- No, Nick.
- I... Katie?

16:37.341 --> 16:41.258
What is happening?!

16:44.317 --> 16:45.345
Liar! You...

16:45.346 --> 16:47.266
Liar!

16:47.267 --> 16:49.316
I'm sorry, Bearclaw,
but I meant Nick

16:49.317 --> 16:51.249
to give my number to Andy.

16:51.250 --> 16:52.294
Silver lining, you have
a huge fan in Nick.

16:52.295 --> 16:54.265
She's not good enough
for you, Bearclaw.

16:54.266 --> 16:55.310
None of these people
are good enough for you.

16:55.311 --> 16:56.333
And, Sam, I'm sorry I stole you

16:56.334 --> 16:59.270
from real Katie,
but ugh, look at you.

16:59.271 --> 17:00.312
- He's so handsome.
- Very handsome.

17:00.313 --> 17:01.310
I'm only human.

17:01.311 --> 17:02.319
You know what, Bearclaw?

17:02.320 --> 17:03.333
I would have take you
to the bathroom,

17:03.334 --> 17:04.342
- big guy.
- He would've.

17:04.345 --> 17:06.266
You guys are terrible people.

17:06.267 --> 17:08.258
- I want to die.
- Hey, hold on a second.

17:08.259 --> 17:10.256
Everyone just calm down.
Are you really a dancer?

17:10.257 --> 17:11.329
- Are you an idiot, Sam?
- Yes!

17:11.332 --> 17:13.310
Did I tell a lie? I did.

17:13.311 --> 17:15.270
But in my defense,

17:15.271 --> 17:17.252
I'm off the grid.

17:17.253 --> 17:18.311
We're all off the grid.
Hey, hey,

17:18.313 --> 17:20.249
we are all off the grid.

17:20.250 --> 17:22.333
Every single one of us,
especially you, handsome.

17:22.334 --> 17:24.333
- I loved you!
- I think that's

17:24.336 --> 17:26.257
a little bit of an exaggeration.

17:26.258 --> 17:28.248
You're gonna tell him
how he feels after everything

17:28.249 --> 17:29.317
- you've just done?
- Why don't you shut up, Andy?

17:29.320 --> 17:31.321
- Yeah, shut up, Andy.
- What is this, recess? Come on.

17:31.324 --> 17:33.321
Shut up. - Shut up.
Shut up, Andy!

17:33.324 --> 17:35.296
Nick.

17:37.250 --> 17:38.253
It's time.

17:38.254 --> 17:39.341
Good-bye.

17:39.342 --> 17:41.270
No, no, Nick.

17:41.271 --> 17:42.296
Old Nick, don't go!

17:42.297 --> 17:44.271
Nick!

17:44.274 --> 17:45.307
Nick, wait.

17:45.308 --> 17:47.253
Please.

17:47.254 --> 17:49.282
There's so much more
I need to ask you.

17:49.283 --> 17:50.323
I got to get back.

17:50.324 --> 17:52.286
Why do I need
to apologize to Jess?

17:52.287 --> 17:53.308
What did I do wrong?

17:55.312 --> 17:58.249
Make her an old-fashioned.

18:08.333 --> 18:10.337
Beep, beep, beep.
Beep, beep, beep.

18:10.338 --> 18:13.270
Beep, boop,
ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

18:13.271 --> 18:16.253
Beep, beep, boop, beep,
ba, ba, ba, beep.

18:16.254 --> 18:17.271
Beep, beep, boop, boop, boo.

18:21.296 --> 18:22.342
I believed you.

18:23.343 --> 18:25.287
Olde England.

18:25.288 --> 18:28.332
Have a good trip, man.

18:28.333 --> 18:30.317
- When I was a kid,
- Yeah.

18:30.320 --> 18:32.253
Watching MTV,

18:32.254 --> 18:34.295
I thought that if I
played my cards right,

18:34.296 --> 18:36.265
I could grow up to
be Jenny McCarthy.

18:36.266 --> 18:37.327
Jenny McCarthy? You?

18:37.328 --> 18:38.338
Don't make that face.

18:38.339 --> 18:40.311
She was so beautiful

18:40.312 --> 18:42.345
with all that swearing,
but you know what?

18:42.346 --> 18:44.291
I'm not Jenny McCarthy.

18:44.292 --> 18:46.249
I know that now.

18:46.250 --> 18:47.338
- I'm back on the grid, Nick.
- You know,

18:47.341 --> 18:49.287
I always wanted
to be Kurt Loder.

18:49.288 --> 18:51.299
Kurt Loder? He
never even went to

18:51.300 --> 18:54.249
the Spring Break House.
He was stuck in New York, talking to Pearl Jam.

18:54.250 --> 18:56.287
He is the elder statesman
of our generation.

18:56.288 --> 18:58.279
Why are you making me a drink?
You never bring work home.

18:58.280 --> 19:00.279
All right, this is gonna
sound really weird,

19:01.280 --> 19:03.337
but in the future I might
do something really bad to you,

19:03.338 --> 19:04.342
and I hope you'll forgive me.

19:06.275 --> 19:08.295
Do you like old-fashioneds,
Jess?

19:08.296 --> 19:10.299
I've actually always
wanted to try one.

19:10.300 --> 19:11.333
How did you know?

19:20.333 --> 19:21.278
What are you gonna do to me?

19:21.779 --> 19:22.632
I don't know.

19:23.333 --> 19:24.699
But it could be bad.

19:25.600 --> 19:28.337
Like me getting drunk
and peeing in your closet

19:28.338 --> 19:29.303
on all your pretty dresses.

19:32.292 --> 19:33.649
I forgive you.

19:36.338 --> 19:38.338
Imagine all that pee
on your pretty dresses, Jess.

19:39.089 --> 19:41.041
I still forgive you.

19:41.042 --> 19:43.045
Hey.

19:43.046 --> 19:45.007
Sam, hi.

19:45.008 --> 19:46.041
Katie?

19:46.042 --> 19:47.999
Not Katie.

19:48.000 --> 19:51.061
Yeah, uh, I'm sorry to come
over here unannounced.

19:51.062 --> 19:55.020
I didn't... I just
wanted to tell you

19:55.021 --> 19:59.024
that I don't... I don't
care that you lied to me.

19:59.025 --> 20:01.041
I lied, too. Half my
profile is a lie.

20:01.042 --> 20:05.003
I am not a shy food blogger

20:05.004 --> 20:09.003
who wants a destination
wedding in Scotland, okay?

20:09.004 --> 20:11.045
I don't open up the
more you get to know me.

20:11.046 --> 20:13.002
I mean, I, you
know, Internet date

20:13.003 --> 20:15.092
so I don't have to sleep
with people I work with.

20:15.093 --> 20:17.041
I do like Creed, though.

20:17.042 --> 20:18.082
I hate Creed.

20:18.083 --> 20:21.028
I don't care what you like

20:21.029 --> 20:23.028
or what your name is,

20:23.029 --> 20:26.037
or... anything about you.

20:26.038 --> 20:27.096
And the good news
is you don't have

20:27.097 --> 20:30.057
to care about me either.

20:30.058 --> 20:34.024
And we can still tear
each other apart.

20:34.025 --> 20:36.045
What do you think?

20:36.046 --> 20:38.016
You know what?

20:38.017 --> 20:39.073
I'm gonna say yes, I think.

20:39.074 --> 20:40.096
Yeah, let's do this.

20:40.097 --> 20:42.074
Um...

20:42.075 --> 20:46.082
Do we start now or later

20:46.083 --> 20:49.062
or now?

20:53.038 --> 20:55.061
Congratulations.
I see you've met the one.
