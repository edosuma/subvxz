00:01.267 --> 00:02.301
<i>My name is avery ryan.</i>

00:02.303 --> 00:03.635
<i>I was a victim of cyber crime.</i>

00:03.637 --> 00:06.372
<i>Like you, I posted</i>
<i>on social media,</i>

00:06.374 --> 00:09.141
<i>Checked my bank account</i>
<i>balance online,</i>

00:09.143 --> 00:11.143
<i>Even kept</i>
<i>the confidential files</i>

00:11.145 --> 00:13.379
<i>Of my psychological practice</i>
<i>on my computer.</i>

00:14.781 --> 00:18.117
<i>Then I was hacked,</i>
<i>and as a result,</i>

00:18.119 --> 00:20.152
<i>One of my patients</i>
<i>was murdered.</i>

00:20.154 --> 00:23.122
My investigation into her death
<i>led me to the fbi,</i>

00:23.124 --> 00:25.691
<i>Where I joined a team</i>
<i>of cyber experts</i>

00:25.693 --> 00:28.594
<i>To wage a war against</i>
<i>a new breed of criminal</i>

00:28.596 --> 00:31.463
<i>Hiding on the deep web...</i>

00:31.465 --> 00:34.700
<i>Infiltrating our daily lives</i>
<i>in ways we never imagined...</i>

00:36.403 --> 00:38.404
<i>...Faceless...</i>

00:38.406 --> 00:40.572
<i>Nameless...</i>

00:40.574 --> 00:42.408
<i>Lurking inside our devices,</i>

00:42.410 --> 00:45.077
<i>Just a keystroke away.</i>

01:04.097 --> 01:07.466
Are you kidding me?
You guys got to back me up.

01:07.468 --> 01:09.468
Young man:
Sorry, dude.

01:12.138 --> 01:14.306
Guys, I'm out. I got to go.

01:37.530 --> 01:40.599
Gps voice: In 100 feet,
turn right on ferris avenue.

01:46.239 --> 01:48.307
You have reached
your destination.

02:11.831 --> 02:13.899
â™ª

02:34.921 --> 02:36.588
Man:
Hey!

02:36.590 --> 02:37.689
What are you doing in my yard?

02:37.691 --> 02:39.158
(gunshot)

02:44.864 --> 02:46.932
Man:
Oh, no.

02:57.477 --> 02:58.911
Mm...
(both laughing)

03:04.751 --> 03:06.485
(alarm beeping)
mm!

03:06.487 --> 03:08.554
I got it.

03:11.958 --> 03:13.892
(alarm stops)

03:15.562 --> 03:19.364
Is it hot in
here to you?

03:19.366 --> 03:21.533
So I was thinking...

03:21.535 --> 03:23.635
Yeah?

03:23.637 --> 03:25.671
...We could go pick up
michelle from your mom's house,

03:25.673 --> 03:27.506
We can go to a nationals game.

03:27.508 --> 03:29.508
The three of us
can have dinner.

03:29.510 --> 03:30.809
Today?

03:30.811 --> 03:32.377
Yeah.

03:32.379 --> 03:33.879
Is that really a good idea?

03:33.881 --> 03:35.480
You're doing it again.

03:35.482 --> 03:36.782
Instead of telling me
how you're feeling,

03:36.784 --> 03:38.383
You're pretending
to ask me a question.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.819
Elijah... We had
such a good night.

03:40.821 --> 03:42.588
Yeah, and we could
have an even better day.

03:48.428 --> 03:50.429
Look, if you don't want
to go to a baseball game,

03:50.431 --> 03:53.398
We could do
something else.
I just...

03:53.400 --> 03:55.734
I thought we agreed
we wouldn't rush.

03:57.270 --> 03:59.705
I'm just... I'm not ready
to bring michelle into this.

03:59.707 --> 04:03.242
This? Meaning us?
Yeah.

04:03.244 --> 04:05.510
Elijah, sometime soon,
you and I-- we're gonna

04:05.512 --> 04:08.313
Have to deal with the real
issues that broke us up.

04:08.315 --> 04:11.350
I want to know that we're solid
before we tell michelle.

04:11.352 --> 04:14.886
(scoffs) I... I was ready to
talk about moving back in.

04:14.888 --> 04:16.722
(phone chiming)

04:22.629 --> 04:23.695
What? What's wrong?

04:23.697 --> 04:25.597
I'm so sorry.
I've got to go.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.666
Oh, all right, well,
we'll... We'll talk later?

04:27.668 --> 04:30.402
Yes.

04:34.440 --> 04:35.741
Ryan:
Yesterday 15-year-old

04:35.743 --> 04:38.677
Spencer chapman was
accidentally shot to death

04:38.679 --> 04:40.612
With a gun hidden
in a hollowed-out

04:40.614 --> 04:42.781
18-volt cordless drill.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.351
(gunshot)

04:54.360 --> 04:56.828
Mundo:
<i>Let me guess-- the gun</i>
<i>that shot spencer was a</i>

04:56.830 --> 04:58.764
Custom-built .22-caliber
semiautomatic pistol

04:58.766 --> 05:00.032
With no serial number.

05:00.034 --> 05:02.634
Sifter: The drill case
and choice of weapon--

05:02.636 --> 05:04.403
They're both signatures
of one distributor.

05:04.405 --> 05:05.904
Trigger is back
in business.

05:05.906 --> 05:08.407
Wait, who's-who's trigger?
A deep web
arms dealer

05:08.409 --> 05:10.309
We've been chasing for years.

05:10.311 --> 05:12.711
Sells guns to anybody
willing to pay his price.

05:12.713 --> 05:15.881
The postal and mailing services
can't detect 'em.

05:15.883 --> 05:17.582
His customers get delivery

05:17.584 --> 05:18.950
Right to their front door.
Krumitz: Every time
we get close,

05:18.952 --> 05:20.619
Trigger dumps his site,
goes underground,

05:20.621 --> 05:21.953
And starts all over.

05:21.955 --> 05:23.889
And that is why
he's number seven

05:23.891 --> 05:25.757
On the cyber
most wanted list.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.492
Nelson: Wait a minute, there's
a cyber most wanted list?

05:27.494 --> 05:28.660
Well, what number was I?

05:28.662 --> 05:30.362
Mm. You didn't
make the list.

05:30.364 --> 05:31.596
Krumitz:
Hey, in my heart,

05:31.598 --> 05:33.598
You were always number one.
Guys,

05:33.600 --> 05:35.334
If trigger is active,
we got a very small

05:35.336 --> 05:37.469
Window of opportunity
to finally catch this guy.

05:37.471 --> 05:39.805
Crime scene found spencer's
prints on both the drill

05:39.807 --> 05:42.374
And the world send package
that was sent to his house

05:42.376 --> 05:44.343
A half an hour
before he was shot.

05:44.345 --> 05:46.578
Well, did spencer chapman
think it was a gun or a drill?

05:46.580 --> 05:48.613
Do we think this kid went
on the deep web

05:48.615 --> 05:50.048
And bought the gun himself?

05:50.050 --> 05:52.517
Well, that's what you're going
to chicago to find out.

05:54.587 --> 05:56.655
Shall we?

06:01.728 --> 06:03.495
Woman:
<i>This can't be real.</i>

06:03.497 --> 06:05.564
He's just a kid.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.466
I don't understand.

06:07.468 --> 06:10.068
You think that-that
spencer got a gun from...

06:10.070 --> 06:11.837
Where?
There's a part of the internet

06:11.839 --> 06:13.705
Where people
can remain anonymous.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.507
It's called the deep web.

06:15.509 --> 06:17.542
We think your son
had access to it.

06:17.544 --> 06:18.977
Who would sell a gun
to a 15-year-old kid?

06:18.979 --> 06:22.848
A deep web arms dealer who
doesn't care who he sells to.

06:22.850 --> 06:24.616
Spencer spent
his weekly allowance

06:24.618 --> 06:26.785
On music and movies
and video games.

06:26.787 --> 06:29.721
I'm telling you--
he didn't buy a gun.

06:31.023 --> 06:33.725
My son is dead

06:33.727 --> 06:35.861
And you are making him out
to be the criminal.

06:35.863 --> 06:37.696
Look, I know this is difficult,

06:37.698 --> 06:39.064
But I have to ask
these questions

06:39.066 --> 06:42.701
So we can find the person
who is responsible.

06:42.703 --> 06:44.736
Did you ever go on to your
son's social media accounts?

06:44.738 --> 06:47.105
Did you ever check his
history on his computer?

06:47.107 --> 06:49.007
Yes, we do.

06:49.009 --> 06:50.876
We did it all the time.

06:50.878 --> 06:53.745
And spencer understood
the responsibilities
of being online.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.981
And we had strict rules
about what he could post

06:55.983 --> 06:57.616
And what sites he could visit.

06:57.618 --> 06:59.918
Ms. Ryan...

06:59.920 --> 07:02.587
Our son was not who you're
suggesting he might be.

07:05.992 --> 07:07.726
Krumitz:
<i>Spencer never</i>

07:07.728 --> 07:10.629
Accessed the deep web, but this
kid was hiding a ton of stuff

07:10.631 --> 07:12.097
From his parents.
Look at this.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.900
Notice anything weird?

07:16.202 --> 07:17.936
Nelson:
Yeah, we might be looking

07:17.938 --> 07:21.106
At the only 15-year-old
with no games, no kik, no apps.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.774
Kid doesn't even
have a friendagenda.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.876
Yeah, exactly.
But check this out.

07:26.979 --> 07:28.880
This is spencer's real tablet.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.949
Nelson: Oh, snap.
He used a parental guidance app

07:30.951 --> 07:33.585
To hide what was on his tablet
from his parents.
Yup.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.520
Spencer gave his parents
a passcode

07:35.522 --> 07:36.922
That only unlocked
part of the tablet.

07:36.924 --> 07:38.623
That way, when they checked...
Mm-hmm?

07:38.625 --> 07:40.692
...All they saw
was what he wanted them to see.

07:40.694 --> 07:41.693
Damn.

07:41.695 --> 07:45.864
If spencer was hiding his online
activity from his parents,

07:45.866 --> 07:47.232
What else was he hiding?

07:47.234 --> 07:49.601
You guys find anything?
No evidence of the deep web

07:49.603 --> 07:51.603
On any of the devices,
but this kid's got secrets, man.

07:51.605 --> 07:55.574
Well, chicago pd recovered
his cell phone from the scene.

07:55.576 --> 07:57.242
Let's see if that
answers any questions.

07:57.244 --> 07:59.044
Spencer's parents

07:59.046 --> 08:00.779
Say that they don't
know ramsey scott,

08:00.781 --> 08:03.482
<i>The man who witnessed</i>
<i>spencer's death,</i>

08:03.484 --> 08:05.083
And that spencer
has no connection to him either.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.785
Krumitz: Well, let's just
see about that.

08:11.057 --> 08:13.925
These coordinates
match ramsey scott's home.

08:13.927 --> 08:15.494
Spencer wasn't just
in the neighborhood.

08:15.496 --> 08:16.928
He went to his house on purpose.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.798
Yeah. It's time to find out
what ramsey scott knows.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.234
Dispatcher:
<i>Dispense all units to</i>

08:22.236 --> 08:23.668
<i>The hoffman carter</i>
<i>investments building</i>

08:23.670 --> 08:25.070
<i>At the 1100 block</i>
<i>of michigan avenue.</i>

08:25.072 --> 08:26.638
<i>Shots fired.</i>

08:36.916 --> 08:40.085
They've confirmed I.D.
On the vic. It's ramsey scott.

08:40.087 --> 08:43.188
We found spencer dead,
and now this.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.923
All right, spencer's death
was an accident.

08:44.925 --> 08:47.259
This is murder.

08:47.261 --> 08:49.094
Sifter:
<i>Chicago pd's</i>

08:49.096 --> 08:50.962
Turned the homicide
investigation over to us.

08:50.964 --> 08:53.298
Without a doubt,
it was premeditated murder.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.567
Ramsey scott was shot
with a .22-caliber

08:55.569 --> 08:58.737
Semiautomatic pistol hidden
in the shell of a power drill.

08:58.739 --> 09:00.672
Trigger was providing
weapons for someone

09:00.674 --> 09:02.841
Who clearly wanted
ramsey scott dead.

09:02.843 --> 09:04.309
If, at first,
you don't succeed...

09:04.311 --> 09:05.877
Sifter: Wait a second,
are you actually saying

09:05.879 --> 09:07.145
That spencer chapman went over

09:07.147 --> 09:09.614
To ramsey scott's house,
in order to kill him?

09:09.616 --> 09:10.882
This was a 15-year-old boy.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.717
At this point,
we can't rule it out.

09:12.719 --> 09:13.985
It looks like someone
finished the job

09:13.987 --> 09:15.854
That spencer failed to complete.

09:15.856 --> 09:17.923
If we can figure out
the connection between
spencer and ramsey...

09:17.925 --> 09:20.992
It would help us I.D.
Ramsey's killer.

09:23.162 --> 09:25.830
I've been checking e-mails
for two hours-- nothing.

09:25.832 --> 09:27.866
There's no apparent connection
between ramsey scott

09:27.868 --> 09:29.868
And spencer chapman.
I've looked at
spencer's calendar,

09:29.870 --> 09:31.937
Friendagenda,
all of his chats-- same thing.

09:31.939 --> 09:34.072
You think he really
went to go shoot this guy?

09:34.074 --> 09:35.774
I mean,
if I was 15 years old

09:35.776 --> 09:37.876
And somebody told me to go kill
someone, I couldn't do it.

09:37.878 --> 09:39.978
I'm a grown-ass man,
I couldn't even do it now.

09:39.980 --> 09:42.113
Really? You're fully grown?

09:42.115 --> 09:43.848
Best things
come in small packages, krummy.

09:45.719 --> 09:49.087
Ramirez:
What did I miss?
No matches in spencer

09:49.089 --> 09:50.689
And ramsey's
text messages.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.791
These two don't even
have an app in common.
Yeah.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.693
Scrubbed all these
devices and got nothing.

09:54.695 --> 09:55.961
No connection
between

09:55.963 --> 09:58.029
Spencer and ramsey scott,
no digital evidence

09:58.031 --> 09:59.931
Of spencer purchasing
a gun or a drill.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.866
Or even going
on a deep web browser.

10:01.868 --> 10:03.868
You checked all the devices?

10:03.870 --> 10:05.303
Yeah, why?
You read your

10:05.305 --> 10:06.871
Probation document,
listing all the devices

10:06.873 --> 10:08.607
You can't touch
outside of work?

10:08.609 --> 10:09.975
All 162 pages?

10:09.977 --> 10:13.211
Well, if you had read
the whole thing, you would know

10:13.213 --> 10:15.246
That there's one device
the fbi left out.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.015
One spencer could
have used to access

10:17.017 --> 10:18.984
A deep web browser.

10:18.986 --> 10:21.019
Good thing the fbi procedure
is to grab everything

10:21.021 --> 10:23.688
Plugged into the walls, because
you guys are only looking

10:23.690 --> 10:26.191
Into the obvious places.

10:26.193 --> 10:28.226
Game consoles
are also computers.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.996
Modern ones even have
the exact same capabilities--

10:30.998 --> 10:33.031
Messaging, apps...
Internet connections.

10:33.033 --> 10:36.835
All of which we can recover data
from. Raven, I love you.

10:36.837 --> 10:38.970
Wait a minute. Raven,
you play <i>game vex?</i>

10:38.972 --> 10:40.138
No.

10:40.140 --> 10:43.008
I crush <i>game vex.</i>

10:47.680 --> 10:48.980
Spencer spent

10:48.982 --> 10:50.982
Most of his time playing
first-person shooters.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.652
Krumitz:
Well, according to these logs,
spencer spent about

10:53.654 --> 10:55.353
Six hours a day
playing video games.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.822
Looks like,
his favorite game, by far,

10:57.824 --> 10:59.724
Was <i>blacklight: Retribution.</i>

10:59.726 --> 11:02.060
Oh. It's an online
multiplayer game.

11:02.062 --> 11:04.362
You play an agent working
for a black ops organization.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.998
Each map is a different
mission fighting terrorists.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
This is the leaderboard.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.736
Mundo: Whoa.
Check out his history.

11:11.738 --> 11:13.905
Spencer was pretty good at this.
He's a top 50 player.

11:13.907 --> 11:17.976
He was doing so well,
and suddenly he dropped in rank.

11:17.978 --> 11:19.277
Ramirez:
Well, usually that means

11:19.279 --> 11:20.979
Parents have cut down
on game time.

11:20.981 --> 11:23.415
Ryan: Okay. But did any of this
activity lead us to trigger?

11:23.417 --> 11:25.850
Ramirez: Unfortunately,
there's no evidence

11:25.852 --> 11:29.220
Of spencer using his game vex
to access the deep web.

11:29.222 --> 11:30.955
Nelson: But we found
something else.

11:30.957 --> 11:33.124
I recovered spencer's
game vex messages.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.860
Basically
the in-console e-mail account.

11:35.862 --> 11:38.129
I did find this odd message
between spencer

11:38.131 --> 11:39.864
And a gamer
with the handle viper75.

11:39.866 --> 11:42.100
You guys should
check this out.

11:42.102 --> 11:46.137
Mundo:
"your mission: Go to 42.01665

11:46.139 --> 11:48.873
"and -87.45021.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.875
"walk four paces north.
Four paces east.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.877
"drop package. Leave.

11:52.879 --> 11:55.280
You will be rewarded."
longitude
and latitude.

11:55.282 --> 11:58.750
Looks like viper75 was sending
spencer on a real-world mission.

11:58.752 --> 11:59.984
Pull up the coordinates.

12:03.322 --> 12:05.924
Sifter:
Right.

12:05.926 --> 12:07.358
That's ramsey
scott's house.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.060
Let's see
the crime scene photos.

12:09.062 --> 12:12.130
Do we have an overall photo
of the house?

12:12.132 --> 12:14.165
Great. Raven,

12:14.167 --> 12:15.934
Highlight spencer's footsteps

12:15.936 --> 12:19.170
From the coordinates to
where we found his body.

12:20.139 --> 12:24.309
Four paces north
and four paces east.

12:24.311 --> 12:27.312
"drop package. Leave.
You will be rewarded."

12:27.314 --> 12:29.147
The package was the gun.

12:29.149 --> 12:31.816
That's what spencer was doing
at ramsey scott's property.

12:31.818 --> 12:33.918
Viper75 purchased
the deep web gun, sent it

12:33.920 --> 12:36.154
To spencer with instructions
on where to put it.

12:36.156 --> 12:37.255
Spencer wasn't there
to shoot ramsey.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.124
He was just delivering the gun.

12:39.126 --> 12:42.127
Why did viper75 want
ramsey scott dead?

12:42.129 --> 12:44.796
Or, for that matter,
use a kid to deliver the gun?

12:44.798 --> 12:47.332
We need to learn more about
viper75 to figure that out.

12:47.334 --> 12:49.868
He's our unknown variable.

12:49.870 --> 12:52.170
When we find him,
we find our murderer.

12:52.172 --> 12:54.305
Yeah, and the icing
on the cake,

12:54.307 --> 12:57.142
We take down trigger.

13:01.547 --> 13:07.952
â™ª I know you've deceived me,
now here's a surprise â™ª

13:09.822 --> 13:15.393
â™ª I know that you have, 'cause
there's magic in my eyes â™ª

13:15.395 --> 13:19.564
â™ª I can see
for miles and miles â™ª

13:19.566 --> 13:23.101
â™ª I can see for miles
and miles â™ª

13:23.103 --> 13:27.472
â™ª I can see
for miles and miles â™ª

13:27.474 --> 13:31.142
â™ª and miles...

13:31.144 --> 13:33.311
â™ª oh, yeah.

13:56.302 --> 13:57.368
(chuckles)

13:57.370 --> 13:59.571
Oh, my god, it worked.

13:59.573 --> 14:02.540
Avery, elijah, come in here.
Check this out.

14:02.542 --> 14:06.878
Okay, most gamers enjoy
the thrill of trash-talking

14:06.880 --> 14:09.581
The other players in real
time via headset, right?
Right.

14:09.583 --> 14:12.383
Young man: Dude, you suck.
Get out of the way.

14:12.385 --> 14:13.952
Those dudes
were wearing heavy armor.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.954
Can't take them all out
by myself.

14:15.956 --> 14:16.955
Young man:
You got pwned.

14:16.957 --> 14:19.891
That stores information
unintentionally

14:19.893 --> 14:21.559
On a console.

14:21.561 --> 14:22.894
Thousands of
bits of data

14:22.896 --> 14:24.629
Are constantly being
sent back and forth

14:24.631 --> 14:25.964
From the memory
and the hard drive.

14:25.966 --> 14:27.432
It's called the swap space,

14:27.434 --> 14:31.035
And this data includes video
and snippets of audio.

14:37.610 --> 14:40.879
Audio? Like viper's voice?

14:40.881 --> 14:44.148
Exactly. So I wrote up a defrag
program that will isolate

14:44.150 --> 14:48.286
Any audio chats in the games
between spencer and viper75.

14:48.288 --> 14:51.155
Cool. Ready? Here we go.

14:51.157 --> 14:54.158
I'm running a defrag
to consolidate the audio data

14:54.160 --> 14:56.561
So it makes sense
when we play it back.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.499
Spencer: I sent you... Invite.
Did you get it?

15:01.501 --> 15:03.968
Viper75:
Affirmative... For battle.

15:03.970 --> 15:06.004
Next time we play,

15:06.006 --> 15:07.505
I'll bring out the tox nade.

15:07.507 --> 15:10.041
Spencer:
Market area. Too many snipers.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.643
I... Pass the level.

15:11.645 --> 15:12.977
Where's your dog?

15:12.979 --> 15:16.014
What's... Name?

15:16.016 --> 15:17.315
Spencer:
Outside. Sam.

15:17.317 --> 15:18.917
Viper75:
When do your parents come home?

15:18.919 --> 15:20.585
Spencer:
They work all the time.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.553
Mission commander, behind you!

15:22.555 --> 15:25.056
Viper75:
Thanks, ghost37.

15:25.058 --> 15:28.026
Well, that got creepy fast.

15:28.028 --> 15:30.061
Did you hear
those questions:

15:30.063 --> 15:32.964
When are your parents home?
What's the dog's name?
Yeah,

15:32.966 --> 15:35.099
This was an online casing
of spencer's home.

15:35.101 --> 15:37.068
Viper was profiling his target,
establishing

15:37.070 --> 15:38.269
Pattern of life,
trying to figure out

15:38.271 --> 15:40.071
When spencer was
the most vulnerable.

15:40.073 --> 15:41.439
Through a game console.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.975
The online gaming world
is a haven for predators:

15:43.977 --> 15:47.078
Pedophiles, sex offenders,
and radicalizers.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.447
They hide behind their handles
to make friends with these kids,

15:49.449 --> 15:51.649
To earn their trust.
These kids don't even know

15:51.651 --> 15:53.318
They're talking
to someone whose goal

15:53.320 --> 15:54.986
Is to take advantage of them.

15:54.988 --> 15:56.721
It's how viper manipulated
spencer.

15:56.723 --> 15:59.057
I'm a gamer.
I love playing online.

15:59.059 --> 16:02.060
But as a parent,
michelle is gonna hate me.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.128
She's not gonna get
to do anything.
You can always use

16:04.130 --> 16:07.298
The access controls-- just
don't let her play online.
I shouldn't have to.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.634
Krumitz, most parents
are relieved when their kids

16:09.636 --> 16:11.669
Are in the safety of their
own home, playing video games,

16:11.671 --> 16:13.671
'cause they think it means
they don't have to worry

16:13.673 --> 16:15.340
About who their kids
are hanging out with,

16:15.342 --> 16:17.342
Are they getting
into trouble, are they safe.

16:17.344 --> 16:20.078
Now that's-that's
just not true anymore.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.580
Would allow their child
to go outside

16:22.582 --> 16:24.983
And play
with a 45-year-old stranger.

16:24.985 --> 16:26.985
(phone rings)
with this,
it happens every day.

16:26.987 --> 16:29.520
Nelson, what's up?

16:29.522 --> 16:31.589
I'll be right there.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.731
We know why spencer
dropped off

16:39.733 --> 16:41.199
The <i>blacklight</i>
<i>leaderboard so quickly.</i>

16:41.201 --> 16:43.134
His avatar was hacked.

16:43.136 --> 16:44.736
Check this out.

16:44.738 --> 16:47.205
Ramirez: This is spencer's
avatar, ghost37,

16:47.207 --> 16:50.141
When he was at the top
of the leaderboard months ago.

16:50.143 --> 16:54.078
His inventory was loaded
with the best weapons and armor.

16:57.182 --> 16:59.517
And this is our man ghost37
right after he was hacked.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.452
I mean, dude lost
his warzone battle armor,

17:01.454 --> 17:03.521
His breakguard legplates,
and his volk helmet.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.590
I mean, everything.

17:07.326 --> 17:09.327
The hacker
basically reset his character.

17:09.329 --> 17:12.330
That's months of time and effort
down the drain.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.632
Not to mention the real-world
money for upgrades.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.734
It would be completely
devastating as a gamer.

17:16.736 --> 17:19.070
The psychology of loss is just
as devastating,

17:19.072 --> 17:21.339
Whether it's real-world
or cyber.

17:21.341 --> 17:23.608
How does this relate to viper75?

17:23.610 --> 17:25.309
Guess who hacked spencer.

17:25.311 --> 17:27.145
How do we know
it was viper75?

17:27.147 --> 17:30.214
This is viper's inventory on the
same date spencer was hacked--

17:30.216 --> 17:31.616
December 26.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.618
Spencer lost his warzone
battle armor, his volk helmet,

17:33.620 --> 17:36.354
And his breakguard legplates.

17:36.356 --> 17:37.655
So, on that same day,

17:37.657 --> 17:39.590
All those items showed up
in viper's inventory?

17:39.592 --> 17:41.125
Ramirez:
Then, a few days later,

17:41.127 --> 17:44.128
Viper75 sent spencer
a suit of titan armor

17:44.130 --> 17:45.596
And a polaris helmet,

17:45.598 --> 17:47.598
Which is extremely
rare in the game.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.067
And spencer's

17:49.069 --> 17:51.636
Been climbing
that leaderboard ever since.

17:51.638 --> 17:54.105
So viper hacks spencer,
then he played the role

17:54.107 --> 17:56.307
Of savior and gave him
a suit of armor.

17:56.309 --> 17:58.176
But it wasn't a gift.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.178
It's a trade
for a favor; a task.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.779
I'll scratch your back,
you deliver a gun.

18:01.781 --> 18:03.514
He was using his power
as mission commander

18:03.516 --> 18:05.716
Over his team in the real world.

18:05.718 --> 18:08.186
Search for any gamers in chicago

18:08.188 --> 18:11.255
Who rocketed up the leaderboard
as quickly as spencer did.

18:11.257 --> 18:15.326
I'm gonna go search
for the identity of viper75.

18:18.864 --> 18:23.201
So game vex refuses to give us
access to viper75's account.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.803
They do realize this is
a federal investigation

18:25.805 --> 18:27.238
And we already have
two dead.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.673
I made them
well aware of that.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.274
They would only share
two things:

18:30.276 --> 18:31.609
Viper75 is using a vpn,

18:31.611 --> 18:33.211
And he set up his account

18:33.213 --> 18:34.812
With a prepaid credit card.

18:34.814 --> 18:36.247
He's covering his tracks,
which means

18:36.249 --> 18:38.316
We won't be able to I.D. Him
from his account.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.251
Well, ever since
snowden went rogue,

18:40.253 --> 18:43.121
These little tech firms have
become obsessed with privacy.

18:43.123 --> 18:45.256
Tell that to spencer's parents.
Avery,

18:45.258 --> 18:47.425
These tech companies are only
concerned with the bottom line.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.494
Now, if customers found out
that their private info

18:49.496 --> 18:51.496
Was being given out,
even to law enforcement,

18:51.498 --> 18:53.464
They'd just stop playing.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.133
But, look,
I haven't given up.

18:55.135 --> 18:56.467
I will see a magistrate,

18:56.469 --> 18:58.769
Try to get a warrant to
let us into viper's account.

18:58.771 --> 19:01.672
I just wish I were walking
in there with a stronger case.

19:03.609 --> 19:05.209
Mundo:
Wow.

19:05.211 --> 19:06.177
He didn't look happy.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.178
Neither do you.

19:07.180 --> 19:10.281
Your call.

19:10.283 --> 19:12.750
Just devon. We're...

19:12.752 --> 19:14.619
I don't know what we're doing.

19:17.756 --> 19:20.591
We seem to have very
different definitions

19:20.593 --> 19:22.293
Of our relationship.

19:22.295 --> 19:24.162
Did you really think
it was gonna be easy?

19:24.164 --> 19:26.397
Yeah. I thought
the hard part was done.

19:26.399 --> 19:28.266
It's okay to be scared.

19:29.535 --> 19:31.903
Okay, enough of
the psychoanalysis.

19:31.905 --> 19:34.705
Nelson and raven brought me up
to speed.

19:34.707 --> 19:37.708
I guess viper hacked spencer
so he could groom him?

19:37.710 --> 19:39.911
First, viper emotionally
bonded with spencer.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.781
<i>He boosted</i>
<i>spencer's confidence.</i>

19:45.617 --> 19:51.189
<i>He invited spencer to join</i>
<i>his team on the battlefield.</i>

19:51.191 --> 19:52.657
(video game gunfire)

19:58.297 --> 20:02.934
<i>Viper became his mission</i>
<i>commander, an authority figure.</i>

20:02.936 --> 20:05.703
<i>Then he hacked him.</i>
<i>Took everything</i>

20:05.705 --> 20:09.574
<i>His online character had.</i>
<i>Just ruined him in the game.</i>

20:09.576 --> 20:10.775
And then poor spencer turned

20:10.777 --> 20:12.610
To the last person
he should've trusted.

20:12.612 --> 20:15.246
His new online friend viper,
who willingly restocked

20:15.248 --> 20:17.682
<i>His weapons and his armor.</i>

20:17.684 --> 20:19.750
<i>Once he proved to spencer</i>

20:19.752 --> 20:22.353
That he could get him back
in the game, he promised him

20:22.355 --> 20:24.622
Something huge if he could
complete a real-world mission.

20:24.624 --> 20:26.624
There are a lot of gamers
out there.

20:26.626 --> 20:28.826
How did viper select spencer?

20:29.795 --> 20:31.796
The game did it for him.

20:31.798 --> 20:34.232
Viper was choosing the
best players in chicago

20:34.234 --> 20:36.234
<i>Who were in the top 50</i>
<i>on the leaderboard,</i>

20:36.236 --> 20:37.768
<i>And spencer was one of them.</i>

20:37.770 --> 20:40.304
Of our search for
a second gamer

20:40.306 --> 20:41.639
Who fits
spencer's profile.

20:41.641 --> 20:43.874
A former high-ranking player
who had a sudden tumble.

20:43.876 --> 20:45.409
One who spends a lot of time
in the game,

20:45.411 --> 20:50.014
The most to lose.
We narrowed the field down
to players in chicago

20:50.016 --> 20:51.415
By using the leaderboard.

20:51.417 --> 20:54.285
Uh, check out
the last 24 hours.

21:02.027 --> 21:03.561
Ace.

21:03.563 --> 21:06.631
Look at his hours.
Almost five a day.

21:06.633 --> 21:08.332
Can we get his address from
his game vex player account?

21:08.334 --> 21:10.468
No. Sifter's having a hard time
getting them to cooperate.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.703
Wait. Hold on.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.372
We might not
even need them.

21:14.374 --> 21:16.040
Most gamers are monogamous
with their handles,

21:16.042 --> 21:17.742
So, let me see something.

21:17.744 --> 21:20.411
Boom.

21:20.413 --> 21:21.846
This dude's got
a togglefly account.

21:21.848 --> 21:24.048
We can get his ip address
from this.

21:24.050 --> 21:26.350
Ryan:
Call the service provider,
get a physical address.

21:26.352 --> 21:30.288
It's time for ace
to hit pause.

21:31.323 --> 21:33.858
(rapid gunfire)

21:33.860 --> 21:35.693
Male voice: The path is clear,
mission commander.

21:35.695 --> 21:37.895
Mundo:
Tell us what you know
about viper75.

21:37.897 --> 21:39.664
He's my hero.

21:39.666 --> 21:40.765
Your hero?!

21:40.767 --> 21:41.999
Yeah, on the battlefield.

21:42.001 --> 21:43.601
He's my mission commander.

21:43.603 --> 21:45.436
Major skills,
always has my back.

21:45.438 --> 21:47.872
See, when I got hacked,
I lost my polaris helmet,

21:47.874 --> 21:50.541
Submachine guns, throwing
knives, everything--

21:50.543 --> 21:51.976
I was a noob
all over again.

21:51.978 --> 21:54.445
And that's when viper75
contacted you?

21:54.447 --> 21:56.347
Yeah. He saved me.

21:56.349 --> 21:58.616
Sent me a gunman suit,
dataluxe battlevest,

21:58.618 --> 22:00.418
Warzone battle armor.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.386
I mean, I was
like a god after that.

22:02.388 --> 22:03.988
Micah, did you deliver a package

22:03.990 --> 22:06.090
To the hoffman carter
investments building last night?

22:06.092 --> 22:07.992
First rule of viper's missions--

22:07.994 --> 22:09.960
You don't talk
about the missions.

22:09.962 --> 22:11.762
Father:
Micah, what mission?

22:11.764 --> 22:14.765
What did you do?

22:14.767 --> 22:18.102
Answer his question now!
Okay!

22:18.104 --> 22:21.639
All I did was deliver the
package to the coordinates.

22:21.641 --> 22:23.441
There was a gun
in that package, micah.

22:23.443 --> 22:25.609
What?!
A gun that was
used to kill a man.

22:25.611 --> 22:27.712
I never looked inside!
I didn't know what it was!

22:27.714 --> 22:29.347
Look, I wasn't supposed
to look inside.

22:29.349 --> 22:30.981
Viper told me not to.

22:30.983 --> 22:36.087
You're sure that micah that
delivered the gun that-that...?

22:37.789 --> 22:40.958
Mundo: Viper75 sent you
all sorts of stuff

22:40.960 --> 22:43.828
What did he send you
when you completed your mission?

22:43.830 --> 22:45.596
When you delivered
the package?

22:45.598 --> 22:48.532
He gave me a katana sword.

22:48.534 --> 22:51.469
Micah and spencer didn't know
what was in those packages.

22:51.471 --> 22:53.104
They were just delivery men.

22:53.106 --> 22:55.106
Then viper swooped in,
took the gun

22:55.108 --> 22:57.408
And killed ramsey scott.

22:57.410 --> 22:59.110
Um, we might have a problem.

22:59.112 --> 23:02.046
Micah said that viper75
gave him a gunman suit,

23:02.048 --> 23:04.515
<i>A dataluxe battlevest</i>
<i>and warzone battle armor</i>

23:04.517 --> 23:07.118
<i>To replace what he lost</i>
<i>when he had been hacked.</i>

23:07.120 --> 23:08.986
It was part
of viper's grooming.

23:08.988 --> 23:12.156
He created a need,
and then he filled it.
Right.

23:12.158 --> 23:13.958
But where'd he get
the game inventory?

23:13.960 --> 23:15.826
See, weapons and
armor can't be

23:15.828 --> 23:17.728
Created by gamers,
it can only be acquired.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.397
Now, spencer didn't
have a gunman suit

23:19.399 --> 23:20.598
Or a dataluxe battlevest.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.433
So, where'd
it come from?

23:22.435 --> 23:24.468
This is bigger than we thought.

23:24.470 --> 23:26.137
Another gamer's been hacked.

23:26.139 --> 23:28.105
<i>He's recruiting</i>
<i>another soldier,</i>

23:28.107 --> 23:32.510
<i>Taking items,</i>
<i>and awarding them to another.</i>

23:32.512 --> 23:35.479
Yeah... One's gonna be all
too happy to do viper's bidding

23:35.481 --> 23:38.149
For an almighty katana sword.

23:39.751 --> 23:42.119
Nelson, I think I might
have found what avery

23:42.121 --> 23:43.788
And elijah
are looking for.

23:43.790 --> 23:45.055
Goldenbeast.

23:45.057 --> 23:47.158
Looks like he was hacked
a few months back.

23:47.160 --> 23:50.194
And broke into the top 50
just this morning,

23:50.196 --> 23:54.131
The gift micah received
after he completed his mission.

23:54.133 --> 23:55.966
It means another gun
was just delivered,

23:55.968 --> 23:57.601
And someone else is
gonna get murdered.

23:57.603 --> 23:59.069
Yeah, if it hasn't
happened already.

24:18.857 --> 24:20.858
Fbi.

24:20.860 --> 24:22.059
We're looking for corey smith.

24:22.061 --> 24:24.495
Corey!

24:26.565 --> 24:27.798
Wait here.

24:30.802 --> 24:32.102
Stop! Fbi!

24:46.017 --> 24:47.618
(panting)

24:48.186 --> 24:49.787
(panting)

24:51.223 --> 24:52.890
(panting)

24:52.892 --> 24:54.191
Don't come any closer.

24:54.193 --> 24:56.560
Calm down, okay?
We just want to talk to you.

24:57.629 --> 24:59.063
Corey, no!

25:00.131 --> 25:03.133
(grunting, car alarm blaring)

25:05.704 --> 25:07.771
(car alarm blaring,
corey panting)

25:12.878 --> 25:16.046
I need an ambulance,
1218 east superior road.

25:16.048 --> 25:19.049
Don't move.
We're getting you help.

25:19.051 --> 25:20.284
I thought I could make it.

25:20.286 --> 25:21.986
I make the jumps all the time.

25:23.154 --> 25:25.589
(groaning)

25:25.591 --> 25:27.558
Where's the package?

25:27.560 --> 25:28.792
What package?

25:28.794 --> 25:30.628
We know you're goldenbeast.

25:30.630 --> 25:32.096
I'm alphaarcher.

25:32.098 --> 25:33.731
Jessica's goldenbeast.

25:34.733 --> 25:36.767
(siren approaching)

25:38.737 --> 25:40.804
Jessica?

25:42.307 --> 25:44.575
Jessica?

25:47.546 --> 25:50.147
(indistinct radio communication)

25:50.149 --> 25:53.584
Corey told the paramedics
he ran because he had drugs.

25:53.586 --> 25:54.985
Now, the charge
for drug paraphernalia

25:54.987 --> 25:56.153
Is virtually nothing.

25:56.155 --> 25:57.922
And then he jumps.

25:57.924 --> 26:00.090
He had to have known
he wasn't gonna make it.

26:00.092 --> 26:02.126
We just witnessed
a prime example

26:02.128 --> 26:04.328
Of game transfer phenomena,

26:04.330 --> 26:06.797
Or what we call
"gtp under the influence."

26:06.799 --> 26:09.166
Gtp? Sounds like something

26:09.168 --> 26:11.602
They'll be selling a pill
for soon.
(laughs)

26:11.604 --> 26:12.970
There's a documented history

26:12.972 --> 26:15.339
Of videogamers experiencing
involuntary impulses

26:15.341 --> 26:18.609
To perform gaming actions
in the real world.

26:18.611 --> 26:19.977
The more they
play the game,

26:19.979 --> 26:22.279
The more they are
in the game, in real life.

26:22.281 --> 26:24.281
Corey thought that he could

26:24.283 --> 26:28.152
Male voice:
You got to jump, man!

26:28.154 --> 26:30.020
...Because he'd done it
so many times in the game.

26:30.022 --> 26:32.723
That-that's just plain crazy.

26:34.259 --> 26:37.628
The shipping label
matches the one

26:37.630 --> 26:39.930
<i>On the box</i>
<i>in spencer's trash.</i>

26:39.932 --> 26:41.732
Right here.
Message from viper

26:41.734 --> 26:43.634
To goldenbeast came in
this morning.

26:43.636 --> 26:48.272
"your package will arrive today.
When it does, deliver to

26:48.274 --> 26:52.276
41.8774 and -87.6106."

26:52.278 --> 26:55.245
Looks like it's grant park.

26:55.247 --> 26:56.914
"walk eight paces north from

26:56.916 --> 26:58.616
Between the trees,
and four paces east."

26:58.618 --> 27:00.250
Goldenbeast already has
her katana sword.

27:00.252 --> 27:02.119
Means she completed her mission.

27:02.121 --> 27:03.754
Viper might be at the park now.

27:03.756 --> 27:06.256
Let's go.

27:09.394 --> 27:13.030
So, avery and elijah are hunting
down goldenbeast and viper.

27:13.032 --> 27:15.866
That leaves us the deep web
arms dealer trigger.

27:15.868 --> 27:18.302
Now, we haven't had
any physical evidence

27:18.304 --> 27:21.038
That could possibly
lead us to him until now.

27:21.040 --> 27:24.208
Got three gun shipping boxes,
three postmarks.

27:24.210 --> 27:25.242
Did you find anything?

27:25.244 --> 27:27.344
I plotted those postmarks,

27:27.346 --> 27:29.780
Trigger shipped from
these three post offices

27:29.782 --> 27:34.885
More than likely, he lives
within that triangle.

27:34.887 --> 27:36.220
That's a huge area.

27:36.222 --> 27:37.688
That's almost all of
hillsborough county, florida.

27:37.690 --> 27:39.089
Yeah, too big to search.

27:39.091 --> 27:40.324
What if he finds us?

27:40.326 --> 27:42.359
Let's slip him a cookie.

27:42.361 --> 27:43.360
What, a supercookie?

27:43.362 --> 27:44.895
Yeah, let's do that.

27:44.897 --> 27:46.964
What is a... What
is a supercookie?

27:46.966 --> 27:50.234
Once an animal, or in
this case, an I.P. Address,

27:50.236 --> 27:51.802
Gets tagged, we can follow it

27:51.804 --> 27:53.103
Wherever it goes.

27:53.105 --> 27:54.204
Well, how do you attach
this supercookie

27:54.206 --> 27:55.372
To a criminal in the deep web?

27:55.374 --> 27:57.708
To click the link
or open an e-mail.

27:57.710 --> 28:01.345
What if we put out a news
article on the internet

28:01.347 --> 28:02.780
About young spencer being killed

28:02.782 --> 28:05.315
With a deep web gun
hidden in a power drill?

28:05.317 --> 28:06.383
I mean, that would get
trigger's attention,

28:06.385 --> 28:07.818
And get him
to click on the article.

28:07.820 --> 28:09.019
<i>I mean, like anyone else</i>

28:09.021 --> 28:11.689
<i>A supercookie</i>
<i>will embed itself</i>

28:11.691 --> 28:12.990
<i>In a part</i>
<i>of the operating system</i>

28:12.992 --> 28:15.693
<i>That he can't see or access.</i>

28:15.695 --> 28:17.728
That article could
get thousands of hits.

28:17.730 --> 28:19.096
I mean, how will we know
which one is trigger?

28:19.098 --> 28:20.431
Krumitz:
Well, we can't know for sure,

28:20.433 --> 28:26.336
<i>And go back into the deep web</i>
<i>will be way smaller.</i>

28:26.338 --> 28:29.006
Yeah, but, again, why would this
guy, who's never been caught...

28:29.008 --> 28:31.041
I mean, why would he click
on that article,

28:31.043 --> 28:33.077
Let alone read it?
Ramirez:
I think it has something

28:33.079 --> 28:35.112
To do
with his narcissistic desire

28:35.114 --> 28:36.380
To read about himself.

28:36.382 --> 28:38.449
Oh, snap. Look.
It's the next avery ryan.

28:38.451 --> 28:40.784
Krumitz:
Well, practically speaking,

28:40.786 --> 28:42.086
I'd say he'd probably
click on the article

28:42.088 --> 28:43.454
To find out exactly
how much we know about him.

28:43.456 --> 28:45.456
Yeah, all right,
this makes sense.

28:45.458 --> 28:47.825
Okay, you write the article,

28:47.827 --> 28:49.860
And I will contact the
newspapers in the tampa area.

28:49.862 --> 28:51.929
We will get this posted
on their homepages.

28:55.100 --> 28:56.800
Dispatch: <i>All units dispatch</i>
<i>to grant park.</i>

28:56.802 --> 28:59.103
<i>Possible suspect in the area.</i>

28:59.105 --> 29:01.939
(sirens blaring)

29:09.114 --> 29:11.014
Chicago pd just
picked up goldenbeast.

29:11.016 --> 29:13.217
<i>Viper trains them well.</i>
<i>She's not talking.</i>

29:18.457 --> 29:22.459
Longitude and latitude places
her in this area of the park.

29:22.461 --> 29:27.131
What was it, eight paces north
from between the trees, right?

29:29.534 --> 29:31.802
And four paces east.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.844
Avery, I found it.

29:40.846 --> 29:42.246
Same type of drill case.

29:44.215 --> 29:46.550
It's empty. Damn it!
We're too late.

29:46.552 --> 29:48.185
Viper75 has the gun.

29:48.187 --> 29:50.087
Well, we know he likes
to kills his victims

29:50.089 --> 29:52.122
As close as possible
to the drop-off location

29:52.124 --> 29:54.258
To minimize his contact
with the murder weapon.

29:54.260 --> 29:56.026
He should still be in the park.

29:56.028 --> 29:58.862
There's so many people.
Anybody could be the suspect.

29:58.864 --> 30:01.298
Ryan:
Or worse yet--

30:01.300 --> 30:03.167
A victim.

30:12.510 --> 30:14.344
(gunfire, screaming)

30:14.346 --> 30:16.046
Came from this
direction.

30:16.048 --> 30:18.348
(people screaming)

30:22.554 --> 30:24.188
(panting)

30:24.190 --> 30:25.322
Elijah.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.057
The gun.

30:27.059 --> 30:29.927
Yeah, but no body.

30:29.929 --> 30:31.094
You think he made us,

30:31.096 --> 30:32.129
Fired the gunshot
as a distraction

30:32.131 --> 30:33.163
So he could escape?

30:33.165 --> 30:36.300
He's done here.

30:52.116 --> 30:52.950
(phone ringing)

30:52.952 --> 30:55.385
This is raven.

30:55.387 --> 30:57.221
Raven, I need you
to do a tower dump.

30:57.223 --> 30:59.223
Give me all the numbers to all
the cell phones that connect

30:59.225 --> 31:01.925
To the cell towers around
grant park beginning...

31:01.927 --> 31:03.360
15 minutes ago.

31:03.362 --> 31:05.629
I'm on it.
I'm pulling it up now.

31:17.542 --> 31:18.609
Got another one.

31:18.611 --> 31:21.645
Yeah, 64.167.84.259.

31:21.647 --> 31:23.347
All right, I'm tracking it

31:23.349 --> 31:25.415
Right now.

31:29.254 --> 31:30.554
Sifter:
What is that insanity?

31:30.556 --> 31:33.657
That is us tracking
the supercookie results

31:33.659 --> 31:35.893
To get to trigger,
our gun dealer.

31:35.895 --> 31:37.227
Just got another deep web hit.

31:37.229 --> 31:38.595
Nelson:
False alarm.

31:38.597 --> 31:40.330
Just a dude checking
out some banned books.

31:40.332 --> 31:42.399
This is like looking
for a needle in a haystack.

31:42.401 --> 31:45.068
And all those people
clicked on the news article

31:45.070 --> 31:46.670
We created?
Yeah. Now we can see

31:46.672 --> 31:50.307
If they visit the deep web.
It's pretty sweet, right?

31:50.309 --> 31:52.409
Of those, how many
visited the deep web?

31:52.411 --> 31:54.678
Hundreds.
Anybody doing anything illegal?

31:54.680 --> 31:56.113
Mostly hackers swapping code.

31:56.115 --> 31:57.381
Others just, you know,

31:57.383 --> 31:58.415
Shopping for stolen comic books,

31:58.417 --> 32:00.317
That type of stuff.
And of course,

32:00.319 --> 32:03.620
The bread and butter
of the internet: Porn.

32:03.622 --> 32:04.621
Huh?

32:04.623 --> 32:06.189
I'm not sure those words should

32:06.191 --> 32:07.190
Go together
in a sentence, but...

32:07.192 --> 32:08.659
(beeping)
we got another one.

32:08.661 --> 32:10.127
Sweet, all right.
These are all the

32:10.129 --> 32:12.062
Web sites our supercookie
has detected this person

32:12.064 --> 32:13.263
Made a visit to.

32:13.265 --> 32:17.968
At the top of the list,
you can see our article.

32:17.970 --> 32:20.504
See that red one
at the bottom--

32:20.506 --> 32:22.639
Dot.Mist-- that's deep web.

32:22.641 --> 32:25.175
We might actually
have something here.

32:25.177 --> 32:27.945
Arsenal. Anonymous handguns.
Is this him? Is this trigger?

32:27.947 --> 32:29.947
There's only
one way to find out.

32:29.949 --> 32:32.716
Let's see...
That's it!

32:32.718 --> 32:35.018
That's trigger's
deep web marketplace.

32:35.020 --> 32:36.687
This is it.
How do we find him?

32:36.689 --> 32:38.388
Well, we've got
the ip address,

32:38.390 --> 32:39.957
So we have the location:

32:39.959 --> 32:41.191
Tampa public library.

32:41.193 --> 32:42.492
It's easier for trigger to stay

32:42.494 --> 32:44.695
Anonymous when he logs
on at a public place.

32:44.697 --> 32:46.530
(whoops)
oh, yeah.

32:46.532 --> 32:49.199
Um...
Just... Just...
All right.

33:07.251 --> 33:08.485
(over radio com):
I've spotted trigger.

33:08.487 --> 33:12.255
Green shirt,
southwest work station.

33:19.297 --> 33:21.131
Remember,
this whole case is shot

33:21.133 --> 33:22.632
If he's able to lock us out.

33:22.634 --> 33:25.002
Separate him from
the keyboard immediately.

33:25.004 --> 33:27.504
Don't let him
shut the computer down.

33:28.706 --> 33:30.273
Go, go, go!

33:32.643 --> 33:34.378
(grunts)
(people shrieking)
fbi!

33:34.380 --> 33:36.713
Remain calm and clear the area.

33:39.083 --> 33:40.550
Stay down.

33:45.723 --> 33:48.625
Yeah, we got you, trigger.
You have the right
to remain silent.

33:48.627 --> 33:50.694
I suggest you take
advantage of that right.

33:52.264 --> 33:55.532
He's logged in
to his deep web gun sales site.

33:55.534 --> 33:57.434
Looks like viper75
paid for three guns

33:57.436 --> 33:58.668
Shipped to addresses
matching

33:58.670 --> 33:59.703
Spencer chapman,

33:59.705 --> 34:01.171
Micah gordon

34:01.173 --> 34:02.506
And jessica pope.

34:02.508 --> 34:03.707
Aka goldenbeast. Okay.

34:03.709 --> 34:06.043
Wait a minute.

34:06.045 --> 34:07.744
We've got an order
for a walther ppk/s pistol

34:07.746 --> 34:09.780
To be sent to a chicago address.

34:09.782 --> 34:11.681
The tracking number
says it was just delivered.

34:12.683 --> 34:15.052
Means the hit is still on.

34:16.421 --> 34:18.555
Avery, we've got I.D.
On two of the occupants

34:18.557 --> 34:20.390
Of the address where the gun
is being delivered.

34:20.392 --> 34:23.093
One male, one female,
each of them has a smartphone.

34:23.095 --> 34:24.761
Krumitz: And we spoke to their
cell service providers and

34:24.763 --> 34:26.830
We are up on their location.
We're sending it to you now.

34:28.766 --> 34:30.534
It's all you two.
Ryan: We got it.

34:30.536 --> 34:32.069
All right, our targets

34:32.071 --> 34:33.637
Are moving in
different directions.

34:33.639 --> 34:37.841
One of them's gonna drop off a
gun that's gonna kill someone.

34:37.843 --> 34:40.310
We have to stop them
before they get to viper.

34:48.453 --> 34:50.821
Ramirez: <i>Avery, the tower dump</i>
<i>got us a match.</i>

34:50.823 --> 34:53.156
<i>Viper's next target</i>
<i>is kim hawthorne.</i>

34:53.158 --> 34:55.125
<i>I'm sending you her address.</i>

35:17.715 --> 35:20.250
Ryan:
Viper75.

35:25.189 --> 35:26.490
You got the wrong guy.

35:26.492 --> 35:28.191
(chuckles)
really?

35:28.193 --> 35:30.827
So you're not here
to kill kim hawthorne?

35:30.829 --> 35:32.829
But this is her
building, right?

35:32.831 --> 35:34.364
Who are you?

35:34.366 --> 35:36.333
How do you know that name?

35:36.335 --> 35:39.302
Special agent avery ryan, fbi.

35:39.304 --> 35:41.471
You were smart when
you shot the gun in the park.

35:41.473 --> 35:42.906
You made it pretty tough
to determine

35:42.908 --> 35:44.708
Who your intended victim was,

35:44.710 --> 35:46.910
Till you
came here tonight.

35:48.813 --> 35:51.781
<i>We compared every phone number</i>

35:51.783 --> 35:55.285
<i>That pinged a cell tower</i>
<i>near grant park</i>

35:55.287 --> 35:58.588
<i>And all the cell phones</i>
<i>in this area.</i>

35:58.590 --> 36:01.358
<i>And there was one in common:</i>

36:01.360 --> 36:03.660
<i>Kim hawthorne.</i>

36:03.662 --> 36:06.696
We know the connection between
ramsey scott and kim hawthorne.

36:06.698 --> 36:10.200
They were both witnesses
at your father's trial.

36:10.202 --> 36:12.169
He was serving 15 years

36:12.171 --> 36:14.571
(alarm ringing)
<i>for felony bank robbery.</i>

36:14.573 --> 36:16.673
Aah!

36:16.675 --> 36:19.910
Viper75:
<i>They're both lying bastards.</i>
<i>My father got</i>

36:19.912 --> 36:21.778
Locked up and was
murdered in prison.

36:21.780 --> 36:23.680
They deserve to die, not him.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.916
Your father was
a criminal and so are you.

36:34.592 --> 36:37.527
And now you tried
to kill a federal agent.

36:37.529 --> 36:41.331
<i>Lucky for me,</i>
<i>we got here before you did.</i>

36:56.881 --> 36:58.949
I'll find another way.

36:58.951 --> 37:01.418
I'll get my revenge.

37:01.420 --> 37:02.786
You can't stop me.

37:06.324 --> 37:07.524
(tires screech)

37:07.526 --> 37:09.659
(sirens wailing)
freeze!

37:12.363 --> 37:14.364
Don't move.

37:15.299 --> 37:16.700
Game over.

37:16.702 --> 37:19.603
I guess so.

37:40.458 --> 37:43.827
(sighs) I think it's time to
lay off the gaming for a while.

37:43.829 --> 37:46.496
(laughs)
leave it to the kids.

37:46.498 --> 37:48.298
Just do it in moderation.

37:48.300 --> 37:50.934
Maybe turn off
the chat function.

37:50.936 --> 37:53.903
Everybody listen up.

37:53.905 --> 37:56.840
What we do here is one of
the hardest jobs there is:

37:56.842 --> 37:59.276
Chasing nameless,
faceless criminals

37:59.278 --> 38:00.610
Who hide behind computers.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.345
It takes dedication,

38:02.347 --> 38:03.847
Skills,

38:03.849 --> 38:05.282
And patience.

38:05.284 --> 38:07.417
Which is why
it's important for us

38:07.419 --> 38:09.386
To recognize our victories.

38:09.388 --> 38:11.921
Krumitz,
please pull up the list.

38:11.923 --> 38:14.557
Mm-hmm.

38:17.028 --> 38:18.795
You know what to do.

38:21.499 --> 38:24.034
(whooping, applause)

38:24.036 --> 38:25.302
Nice work.

38:25.304 --> 38:28.672
Ah.
Yeah.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.708
Way to go.
Nice, nice.

38:31.710 --> 38:33.643
(whoops)

38:33.645 --> 38:36.346
Krumitz:
Oh, well,

38:36.348 --> 38:39.549
Still can't believe
I wasn't on the list.

38:39.551 --> 38:42.419
I was.
Y'all punking me, right?

38:42.421 --> 38:43.953
Like, I know I'm on
the list, I...

38:43.955 --> 38:46.423
I'm really not
on the list? For real?

38:48.559 --> 38:50.860
Sorry to bother you
at work.

38:50.862 --> 38:52.796
No, no, no, it's fine.
No, we just, uh,

38:52.798 --> 38:54.531
We just solved
a case, so...

38:54.533 --> 38:56.966
It's a good day.

38:56.968 --> 38:58.968
Just got even better.

38:58.970 --> 39:00.570
Sounds like it.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.708
You know, when I heard
your voice mail...

39:04.710 --> 39:07.043
Okay, about the voice mail,
listen, I'm-I'm sorry.

39:07.045 --> 39:09.946
I... I should not have
given you that ultimatum.

39:09.948 --> 39:11.715
No, you were right.

39:11.717 --> 39:13.850
It has to be all or nothing.

39:16.654 --> 39:19.122
And, uh...

39:19.124 --> 39:20.724
I want it all.

39:20.726 --> 39:22.826
You know,
I thought about

39:22.828 --> 39:25.929
Why we split up
in the first place.

39:25.931 --> 39:28.732
We weren't good at saying
what we wanted

39:28.734 --> 39:30.467
Or how we felt.

39:30.469 --> 39:32.035
No, we were...

39:34.038 --> 39:35.605
...We were afraid.

39:37.742 --> 39:40.977
I stayed so we could
be together.

39:40.979 --> 39:43.046
All three of us.

39:57.695 --> 39:59.696
Michelle and I will
see you at home.

40:04.101 --> 40:06.469
(laughing)

40:06.471 --> 40:07.804
You good?

40:07.806 --> 40:09.406
Better than good.

40:09.408 --> 40:11.541
Ramirez: Who's in?
Nelson: Oh, hell, yeah.

40:11.543 --> 40:12.809
Pass the controller.

40:12.811 --> 40:14.611
I'll show you how
it's done, okay?

40:14.613 --> 40:16.179
You talking
smack to me?
Come on,

40:16.181 --> 40:17.781
You want to play
with these guys.

40:17.783 --> 40:19.482
Uh, actually, if it's okay
with you, I'm gonna...

40:19.484 --> 40:20.683
I'm gonna go home.

40:20.685 --> 40:21.785
Mm...!

40:21.787 --> 40:23.920
All right, krumitz, are you in?

40:23.922 --> 40:25.755
No. No way.

40:25.757 --> 40:27.924
Come on, bro.
What?
No.

40:27.926 --> 40:29.726
Okay, I'm in, I'm in.
Can't wait
all right, sifter.

40:29.728 --> 40:31.761
To see the look on my son's
face when you teach me

40:31.763 --> 40:33.596
How to "pwn" him.

40:34.465 --> 40:37.100
What? I listen
when you guys talk.

40:37.102 --> 40:40.637
All right, you've been warned,
I'm gonna smoke you.

40:40.639 --> 40:43.506
That doesn't
seem likely.
I think not.

40:43.508 --> 40:44.774
Oh, look at that.
Sifter,
you gotta move

40:44.776 --> 40:46.609
You're going
the wrong way.
Your player first.

40:46.611 --> 40:48.812
I'm just looking for
the "pwn" button here.
There's no "pwn" button.

40:48.814 --> 40:50.513
Ramirez: Oh, I'm right
behind you, avery.

40:50.515 --> 40:52.148
Don't even think about it--
that's mine, that's mine!
