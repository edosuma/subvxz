04:10.367 --> 04:11.664
Hey ya! Hey ya!

06:12.966 --> 06:15.400
Why, Smilla?

06:15.469 --> 06:17.198
My baby.

06:17.271 --> 06:18.932
Isaiah!

06:42.065 --> 06:45.158
He was playing on the roof.
He fell.

06:45.235 --> 06:47.635
All right, nothing to see now.
Come on.

07:15.567 --> 07:17.933
I just need a few
from this angle.

07:21.409 --> 07:22.397
O.K.

07:33.520 --> 07:36.820
I f-f-found him.

07:43.963 --> 07:45.763
What made him run?

07:45.835 --> 07:47.598
Who are you?

07:47.670 --> 07:51.070
I'm the lady who lived
upstairs from him.

07:51.140 --> 07:52.869
He's the gentlemen
from the ground floor.

07:52.942 --> 07:54.671
Well, you're not
allowed up here.

07:54.744 --> 07:57.177
I'll need the footprints
of the deceased.

07:57.246 --> 08:00.181
I don't know why the hell
he was playing up here,

08:00.249 --> 08:02.911
running around wild
without supervision.

08:02.985 --> 08:05.181
A strange way to play,
don't you think?

08:05.254 --> 08:06.687
Take these people
downstairs.

08:06.756 --> 08:09.851
The tracks go in a straight
line towards the edge.

08:09.927 --> 08:12.417
No child in the world
would play like that.

08:16.700 --> 08:18.634
Can you just
go down now, please?

08:28.648 --> 08:31.411
Why so many accidents,
Smilla?

08:31.484 --> 08:34.648
First my husband,
and now my baby.

08:34.721 --> 08:36.153
Why, Smilla?

08:36.222 --> 08:37.280
I don't know.

08:37.356 --> 08:41.121
How am I going to go
to the morgue tomorrow?

08:44.231 --> 08:46.165
If they think
it's an accident,

08:46.233 --> 08:48.167
why are they doing
an autopsy?

08:48.234 --> 08:51.670
They told me
to show up and...

08:51.738 --> 08:52.669
sign papers,

08:52.739 --> 08:54.673
and get his things.

08:57.409 --> 08:59.174
I'll go, Juliane.

08:59.247 --> 09:00.679
Let me go.

09:23.448 --> 09:25.611
I had hoped he would
live a long life.

09:25.685 --> 09:27.950
Yes. All parents hope that
for their children.

09:29.589 --> 09:30.954
I have children
of my own.

09:31.024 --> 09:34.083
I know how
you must feel.

09:34.160 --> 09:35.593
My deepest condolences.

09:37.331 --> 09:39.059
I'm not his mother.

09:39.131 --> 09:40.759
We were friends.

09:43.671 --> 09:46.800
Beat it,
you little shit.

09:49.078 --> 09:50.773
Wanna read me a story?

09:50.846 --> 09:53.245
No, I won't
read you a story.

10:05.594 --> 10:07.892
Persistent little bastard,
aren't you?

10:07.963 --> 10:09.658
I can't be your
little friend. O.K.?

10:09.732 --> 10:11.633
I have nothing
to offer you.

10:11.700 --> 10:13.895
Just go away.
Hmm?

10:15.604 --> 10:18.233
Look, there's absolutely
no future in this.

10:38.731 --> 10:41.722
"A point is that which
cannot be divided.

10:41.801 --> 10:43.961
A line is a length
without breadth."

10:44.036 --> 10:45.867
This can't possibly
interest you.

10:47.907 --> 10:49.670
Hmm.

10:49.741 --> 10:51.175
"A semicircle is a figure

10:51.244 --> 10:52.676
contained within a diameter

10:52.745 --> 10:54.678
and the circumference intersected

10:54.746 --> 10:56.647
by the diameter."

10:59.685 --> 11:01.019
You smell bad.

11:04.759 --> 11:07.694
I don't mean to say this
to hurt your feelings,

11:07.762 --> 11:09.423
but you really stink.

11:10.700 --> 11:11.688
What interests you?

11:14.970 --> 11:16.631
Do you know anything
about Greenland?

11:16.706 --> 11:17.865
Hmm.

11:17.939 --> 11:19.372
You should know something

11:19.441 --> 11:21.136
about where you're from.

11:21.209 --> 11:22.142
Why?

11:22.210 --> 11:24.270
Because it tells you
who you are.

11:25.715 --> 11:27.648
It's important
to know who we are.

11:27.716 --> 11:29.742
Do you know
who you are?

11:29.819 --> 11:31.480
No.

11:31.554 --> 11:33.215
Did your mom
read you stories?

11:33.289 --> 11:34.653
She told me stories.

11:34.723 --> 11:36.122
About what?

11:36.192 --> 11:37.181
About Greenland.

11:37.259 --> 11:39.057
When she used to hunt,
stories like that.

11:42.501 --> 11:44.935
Miss Smilla,
can we go home?

11:45.002 --> 11:46.560
Why, are you tired?

11:46.637 --> 11:48.104
No, home to Greenland.

11:49.808 --> 11:52.299
What do you want me to do,
lie to you?

11:52.377 --> 11:54.810
Tell you we'll go to Greenland
and then not go?

11:54.879 --> 11:55.937
Get your hopes up?

12:00.219 --> 12:02.153
If Inuits who are feuding

12:02.221 --> 12:04.655
wish to reconcile,

12:04.723 --> 12:06.816
they touch each other's breasts,

12:06.892 --> 12:10.692
and say ilaga.

12:10.763 --> 12:11.821
Ilaga.

12:13.999 --> 12:15.261
Ilaga.

12:15.334 --> 12:16.562
It means friend.

12:20.241 --> 12:22.141
Ilaga.

12:22.209 --> 12:24.201
When a child
dies like that,

12:24.279 --> 12:26.144
it's a tragedy.
Terrible accident.

12:27.215 --> 12:28.580
It wasn't an accident.

12:30.718 --> 12:31.651
I see.

12:31.719 --> 12:32.652
Who did the autopsy?

12:32.721 --> 12:34.153
It was routine.

12:34.222 --> 12:36.348
That's not what I asked you.

12:38.461 --> 12:39.392
Doctor Loyen.

12:39.462 --> 12:41.156
Johannes Loyen?

12:41.229 --> 12:44.927
Isn't he the head of
the Institute of Arctic Medicine?

12:45.001 --> 12:46.262
Mm-hmm.

12:46.334 --> 12:47.666
Why would such a famous man

12:47.737 --> 12:50.035
do an autopsy on a 6-year-old?

12:50.106 --> 12:51.936
It was routine.

12:52.008 --> 12:53.032
So you've said.

12:55.745 --> 12:57.805
I'm so sorry for your loss.

13:18.236 --> 13:20.466
Do you think
his feet were cold?

13:20.539 --> 13:22.529
He always wore those sneakers.

13:24.209 --> 13:27.646
When I saw him
lying there in the snow,

13:27.713 --> 13:30.146
his soles were so run-down.

13:30.216 --> 13:32.150
His feet must have been cold.

13:35.055 --> 13:37.183
Would you like something to drink?

13:37.258 --> 13:39.021
I may be from Greenland,
but I don't drink.

13:39.093 --> 13:40.651
Are you...

13:40.728 --> 13:41.990
Are you hungry?

13:42.064 --> 13:44.497
Look, I don't want to share
anything with you. O.K.?

13:44.565 --> 13:45.555
O.K.

13:46.400 --> 13:47.662
Perhaps you can sleep.

13:50.738 --> 13:52.205
Go-G-Good night.

13:52.273 --> 13:53.672
Do you always stutter?

13:56.545 --> 13:57.534
No.

13:57.613 --> 13:59.171
I make you nervous then?

14:01.482 --> 14:05.544
Don't you think I see
the way you look at me?

14:05.621 --> 14:07.179
What did you think,
we'd get drunk

14:07.256 --> 14:10.089
and fuck all night,
fueled by our mutual grief?

14:10.158 --> 14:11.489
Is that what you thought?

14:11.560 --> 14:13.255
It's O.K., Smilla.

14:16.100 --> 14:17.568
I loved him, too.

14:18.937 --> 14:20.131
Yeah.

14:22.072 --> 14:23.631
Of course you did.

14:34.518 --> 14:35.679
Dr. Loyen.

14:37.722 --> 14:40.054
You're of Greenlandic descent.

14:40.125 --> 14:41.648
My mother was Greenlandic.

14:41.725 --> 14:43.387
You were the one
who examined Isaiah?

14:43.461 --> 14:44.393
Yes.

14:44.461 --> 14:45.953
What I would like to know is

14:46.032 --> 14:47.794
what did he die of?

14:47.866 --> 14:50.562
He fell from
a height of 5 stories.

14:50.635 --> 14:52.125
The organism as a whole
simply collapses.

14:52.204 --> 14:53.864
Was there any trace
of violence?

14:53.939 --> 14:57.172
None at all.
What makes you think that?

14:57.244 --> 14:59.678
Is it possible
to see the report?

14:59.747 --> 15:01.179
You wouldn't understand it.

15:04.251 --> 15:06.186
Look, both we and the police

15:06.254 --> 15:07.686
are interested in

15:07.755 --> 15:09.586
the most thorough
investigation possible.

15:09.657 --> 15:10.589
In a case like this,

15:10.658 --> 15:12.625
if there's even
the slightest doubt,

15:12.693 --> 15:15.630
we look for everything
and we find everything.

15:15.697 --> 15:17.163
A child defends itself,

15:17.231 --> 15:19.131
gets skin cells under its nails.

15:19.201 --> 15:21.191
There was nothing like that,
nothing at all.

15:21.270 --> 15:23.703
We looked at the police report.

15:23.771 --> 15:25.636
The footprints show quite clearly

15:25.707 --> 15:28.141
that the boy was alone on the roof

15:28.209 --> 15:29.301
before he fell.

15:29.377 --> 15:31.141
There was nothing to indicate

15:31.213 --> 15:34.514
that this was anything
but an accident.

15:34.585 --> 15:37.145
It's tragic, of course,

15:37.220 --> 15:39.485
but the case is closed.

15:41.359 --> 15:44.157
Now, please drop by again,
my dear lady,

15:44.228 --> 15:46.924
if there's anything else
that troubles you.

15:54.572 --> 15:57.507
I'm filing a complaint
with the district attorney.

15:57.575 --> 15:58.804
What makes this your business?

15:58.877 --> 16:01.174
A 6-year-old boy was murdered.

16:01.246 --> 16:03.077
I'm making it my business.

16:03.148 --> 16:05.173
I've told you there's
no forensic evidence

16:05.250 --> 16:07.184
to indicate foul play,
none whatsoever.

16:07.252 --> 16:09.914
I don't really care about
your forensic evidence.

16:09.988 --> 16:11.682
I knew him,

16:11.756 --> 16:13.624
and that's my evidence.

16:13.695 --> 16:15.628
We all have our phobias.

16:15.696 --> 16:18.359
Do you know what
Isaiah's was?

16:18.433 --> 16:20.024
It was heights.

16:20.100 --> 16:22.125
Nevertheless, he was up there.

16:22.201 --> 16:23.760
Yes, he was.

16:23.837 --> 16:25.327
And what puzzles me...

16:27.207 --> 16:28.299
what keeps me awake at night

16:28.375 --> 16:30.970
is wondering what made him
go up there at all.

16:38.719 --> 16:40.813
May I please spend the night?

17:40.703 --> 17:41.603
Hello!

17:41.704 --> 17:43.501
Hello!

17:43.573 --> 17:45.268
We're going
to miss the film.

17:45.341 --> 17:46.272
You're late.

17:46.342 --> 17:47.604
I've called the agency twice.

17:47.677 --> 17:49.110
It's not the baby-sitter, dear.

17:49.178 --> 17:50.440
Come in.

17:52.882 --> 17:55.317
We get 1,000 cases a year.

17:55.384 --> 17:57.318
I can't be expected
to remember every single one.

17:57.386 --> 18:00.480
Unburden yourself, Lagermann.

18:00.556 --> 18:01.955
You'll feel better.

18:03.192 --> 18:06.219
We were very busy
the night he was brought in:

18:06.294 --> 18:08.126
drunk drivers, Christmas parties.

18:08.197 --> 18:09.631
You're not squeamish, are you?

18:09.700 --> 18:10.634
No.

18:18.844 --> 18:20.778
I have a little trick,

18:20.846 --> 18:22.781
the kind of thing
you invent in any profession.

18:22.848 --> 18:25.475
I hold a light bulb
inside his trousers.

18:29.088 --> 18:31.488
In one leg,
there is a perforation.

18:33.326 --> 18:35.657
I examine the boy again.
All of this is routine.

18:37.363 --> 18:38.591
I find a hole in his thigh.

18:40.099 --> 18:41.533
There's no bleeding,

18:41.601 --> 18:42.930
and the tissue hasn't contracted.

18:43.002 --> 18:44.128
You know what that means?

18:44.203 --> 18:45.295
No.

18:45.372 --> 18:47.602
It means that
whatever happened at that spot

18:47.673 --> 18:50.269
occurred after his heart
had stopped beating.

18:54.049 --> 18:56.107
I take a closer look
at his trousers.

18:56.185 --> 18:58.915
There's a little indentation
around the hole.

19:02.224 --> 19:04.317
This rings a bell.

19:04.393 --> 19:07.123
So I get out
a biopsy needle,

19:07.197 --> 19:10.132
a kind of syringe, quite big,
attached to a handle.

19:10.199 --> 19:12.667
You plunge it into the tissue
to get a sample.

19:14.470 --> 19:16.437
The hole in his trousers

19:16.505 --> 19:18.439
was where someone in a hurry

19:18.507 --> 19:20.975
shoved it in
with a good whack.

19:23.146 --> 19:25.579
Someone had taken
a muscle biopsy from him

19:25.648 --> 19:27.080
after he died.

19:27.149 --> 19:28.585
The ambulance men?

19:28.653 --> 19:30.587
I talked to the driver
and the medics

19:30.655 --> 19:32.589
and the orderlies
who received the body.

19:32.657 --> 19:35.217
They all swore
on a stack of Bibles

19:35.293 --> 19:36.817
that they didn't do it.

19:44.003 --> 19:46.665
Why didn't Loyen
tell me this?

19:46.739 --> 19:49.708
I was just beginning the autopsy
when Loyen arrived.

19:51.544 --> 19:53.171
He was surprised
I'd started on the boy.

19:55.014 --> 19:57.141
He pulled me off it
and took over.

19:57.216 --> 20:00.117
What do you think
was after him on the roof?

20:00.186 --> 20:02.120
I don't know.

20:02.188 --> 20:05.123
But I won't be much
in the Christmas spirit

20:05.191 --> 20:06.783
until I find out.

20:12.033 --> 20:13.831
Please don't come here again.

20:17.639 --> 20:19.335
One more thing.

20:19.408 --> 20:20.466
The night he died

20:20.542 --> 20:23.136
wasn't the first time
I'd seen him.

20:23.212 --> 20:24.645
He came in once a month.

20:24.712 --> 20:26.647
Loyen examined him...

20:26.715 --> 20:28.080
alone.

20:28.150 --> 20:30.209
I don't suppose
there are any records.

20:30.286 --> 20:31.651
I've already looked.

20:31.720 --> 20:32.652
Nothing.

20:35.624 --> 20:37.148
Man:
Blessed be the God and Father

20:37.227 --> 20:38.659
of our Lord Jesus Christ

20:38.727 --> 20:40.558
who had blessed us with
all spiritual blessings,

20:40.629 --> 20:44.087
and heavenly places of the Christ...

20:44.166 --> 20:46.501
...the foundation of the world...

20:46.571 --> 20:49.562
that we should be holy
and without blame before Him.

20:49.640 --> 20:52.906
And love, having predestinated us...

20:52.978 --> 20:55.912
...by Jesus Christ who Himself...

20:55.981 --> 20:59.211
...in praise of
the glory of His grace,

20:59.283 --> 21:01.684
wherein He hath made us accepted...

21:01.753 --> 21:05.553
in whom we have redemption
through His blood,

21:05.624 --> 21:07.557
the forgiveness of sins,

21:07.626 --> 21:10.288
according to
the riches of His grace...

21:31.720 --> 21:33.847
Who was that man at the funeral?

21:33.922 --> 21:35.481
What was he trying to give you?

21:35.558 --> 21:37.650
I don't want his money no more.

21:37.727 --> 21:38.658
Dirty money.

21:38.728 --> 21:40.025
What money?

21:41.628 --> 21:43.153
Why does he give you money?

21:43.231 --> 21:45.699
They always try to buy me out.

21:45.767 --> 21:47.894
First my husband, now my kid.

21:47.969 --> 21:48.901
Who's they?

21:57.245 --> 21:58.439
"We wish to inform you

21:58.513 --> 22:00.311
that the directors
of Greenland Mining

22:00.383 --> 22:04.822
have decided to grant you
a widow's pension

22:04.890 --> 22:08.052
following the death
of your husband...

22:08.126 --> 22:10.252
Norsaq Christiansen."

22:11.797 --> 22:15.323
It's signed Elsa Lubing.
Who's she?

22:17.069 --> 22:18.865
Who's Elsa Lubing?

22:18.936 --> 22:20.302
Can I take this?

22:25.843 --> 22:26.775
Oh, yes.

22:26.844 --> 22:28.745
I filmed this as you came back

22:28.814 --> 22:30.839
from the hunting trip
with your mother.

22:30.916 --> 22:33.145
You'd had bad weather
with a lot of fog.

22:33.218 --> 22:35.652
You were lost.
Everyone had given up hope.

22:35.721 --> 22:37.155
Your mother said

22:37.221 --> 22:38.985
you suddenly pointed
with complete conviction.

22:39.057 --> 22:41.549
You knew the way home.

22:41.627 --> 22:42.993
No one could explain it.

22:43.062 --> 22:44.258
From that day on,

22:44.331 --> 22:47.358
they always strapped you
to the front of the sledge

22:47.436 --> 22:50.030
whenever they went
on a hunting trip.

22:51.739 --> 22:53.970
You knew exactly
how to get home.

22:54.042 --> 22:55.201
Yeah, Father.

22:55.276 --> 22:57.268
How the hell
do you explain that?

22:57.344 --> 22:58.778
I don't know.

22:58.846 --> 23:00.144
I just knew.

23:00.214 --> 23:03.343
You were a regular
little Eagle Scout.

23:05.454 --> 23:07.422
A real little
Nanook of the North.

23:07.488 --> 23:08.980
Cut it out, Benja.

23:09.058 --> 23:10.387
You should try Brentan.

23:10.458 --> 23:11.427
What?

23:11.494 --> 23:14.360
Brentan. For fungus
between the toes.

23:14.429 --> 23:15.555
It's not fungus.

23:15.630 --> 23:17.655
People don't get that
till they reach your age.

23:17.732 --> 23:19.632
Yeah, adolescents do, too.

23:19.702 --> 23:21.635
Especially if
you work out a lot.

23:21.703 --> 23:24.640
And it spreads quite easily
to the crotch.

23:29.247 --> 23:31.374
What do you know
about Johannes Loyen?

23:32.784 --> 23:34.445
He's a...

23:34.519 --> 23:35.644
very talented man.

23:35.719 --> 23:37.085
He created the Institute
for Arctic Medicine.

23:37.155 --> 23:40.147
What's his interest
in forensic medicine?

23:40.225 --> 23:42.159
He started out as a pathologist.

23:42.228 --> 23:44.492
He did an autopsy
on a 6-year-old boy.

23:44.563 --> 23:46.154
Ha.

23:46.231 --> 23:48.324
Must have been a good career move.

23:49.733 --> 23:51.396
Since our school days,

23:51.470 --> 23:53.369
Loyen has always wanted
to be recognized

23:53.438 --> 23:54.667
as the best in the world,

23:54.740 --> 23:57.674
not just in Denmark,
but in the universe.

23:57.742 --> 24:00.142
It wasn't a flame
like in the rest of us.

24:00.211 --> 24:02.909
It was a conflagration.

24:02.983 --> 24:04.542
He wrote this as his thesis

24:04.619 --> 24:06.314
for his professorial degree.

24:06.387 --> 24:08.252
"Mesozoan Parasites."
What are they?

24:08.321 --> 24:10.051
Prehistoric worms.

24:13.794 --> 24:15.227
Write me a prescription, Father.

24:15.297 --> 24:17.059
Are you sick, Smilla?

24:17.131 --> 24:19.064
With this piece of paper,

24:19.133 --> 24:20.623
you can save my life

24:20.701 --> 24:22.726
and keep your hippocratic oath.

24:22.803 --> 24:25.272
It has to be 5 figures.

24:25.339 --> 24:27.068
I let someone down.

24:28.976 --> 24:31.001
A child.

24:31.079 --> 24:33.047
It'll take money
to do something about it.

24:33.115 --> 24:35.981
I'm afraid that check
won't be nearly enough.

24:37.518 --> 24:39.145
He only gives you money

24:39.220 --> 24:41.157
because you make him
feel so guilty.

24:41.225 --> 24:42.590
He told me that.

24:42.659 --> 24:44.150
And he only gives you money, Benja,

24:44.227 --> 24:46.856
because you're such
an amusing little fuck.

24:46.931 --> 24:48.865
But one day, like all of us,

24:48.933 --> 24:50.366
you'll wake up

24:50.435 --> 24:52.402
and your perfect tits
will be starting to sag,

24:52.469 --> 24:54.334
and your perfect little piquant ass

24:54.405 --> 24:56.134
will be starting to go.
Then what, Benja?

24:56.206 --> 24:57.673
By then, Smilla,

24:57.742 --> 24:59.675
you'll be dead,
and I won't care.

24:59.743 --> 25:01.006
Come for Christmas dinner?

25:04.048 --> 25:06.176
I don't celebrate Christmas.

25:06.251 --> 25:08.276
It doesn't mean anything to me.

25:15.850 --> 25:18.342
They hunted seals by their igloos.

25:18.419 --> 25:21.619
They stalked them
with screens on the ice.

25:26.597 --> 25:28.657
"They waited for them
on a floe edge,

25:28.733 --> 25:32.260
and they harpooned them
from kayaks."

25:33.705 --> 25:35.137
They hunted them

25:35.205 --> 25:38.107
in the bluish darkness
of the winter night.

25:38.176 --> 25:41.111
To the Inuits,
the seal was life.

25:41.179 --> 25:43.079
Isaiah, what did I just say?

25:43.146 --> 25:46.139
Isaiah?

25:46.217 --> 25:48.014
Tell me what I just said.

25:48.086 --> 25:50.111
Tell me.

25:50.188 --> 25:52.350
What did I just say?

25:54.192 --> 25:55.216
My God.

25:59.566 --> 26:00.556
Juliane?

26:00.635 --> 26:02.603
Juliane, Isaiah's gone deaf.

26:02.669 --> 26:04.136
He's gone deaf

26:04.205 --> 26:05.637
from having 3 ear infections

26:05.705 --> 26:07.731
from you not taking care of him!

26:07.807 --> 26:09.742
Doctors say he was O.K.

26:09.810 --> 26:10.741
What doctors?

26:10.811 --> 26:12.301
Who told you he's O.K.?

26:12.380 --> 26:13.904
He's not O.K.

26:13.981 --> 26:15.676
There's nothing
to worry about.

26:22.556 --> 26:23.989
Ilaga.

26:24.059 --> 26:25.491
I'm not mad at you.

26:25.558 --> 26:26.491
Ilaga.

26:26.560 --> 26:28.026
Stop it.
I'm not mad at you.

26:28.095 --> 26:30.427
Ilaga, ilaga.

26:31.665 --> 26:35.032
Yes, you're my friend.

26:35.102 --> 26:36.467
Ilaga, Isaiah.

27:04.402 --> 27:05.630
Please...

27:07.204 --> 27:08.501
don't be frightened.

27:09.841 --> 27:11.672
I'm from the district
attorney's office.

27:11.742 --> 27:13.802
Do you always
make house calls?

27:13.878 --> 27:17.509
Let's just say it's
the nature of this case...

27:17.584 --> 27:20.553
and because of your
thought-provoking letter.

27:20.620 --> 27:22.554
I spoke to Professor Loyen.

27:22.621 --> 27:25.089
He told me that
you came in to see him.

27:25.158 --> 27:27.058
There were tracks
in the snow.

27:27.127 --> 27:28.958
I read the report
and looked at the pictures.

27:29.029 --> 27:31.088
You have to have special
lenses and lights

27:31.164 --> 27:33.132
or it doesn't show up.

27:33.200 --> 27:35.065
What doesn't show up?

27:35.136 --> 27:37.035
They were acceleration tracks.

27:37.105 --> 27:39.072
When you take off
from the snow or ice,

27:39.139 --> 27:40.902
a pronation occurs
in the ankle joint

27:40.974 --> 27:43.136
like when you walk
barefoot in the sand.

27:43.211 --> 27:44.678
If the movement is too fast,

27:44.746 --> 27:45.770
not firm enough,

27:45.847 --> 27:47.177
they'll be a little slip backwards.

27:47.247 --> 27:48.578
As with any child who is playing...

27:48.649 --> 27:50.583
If you're used to
playing in the snow,

27:50.651 --> 27:52.585
you don't leave that kind of track

27:52.653 --> 27:55.451
because the movement
is not efficient.

27:55.524 --> 27:59.518
He grew up in Greenland.
He was used to snow.

27:59.596 --> 28:00.996
You don't believe me?

28:01.064 --> 28:03.498
I didn't say that.

28:03.567 --> 28:06.091
The truth is
I've felt uncomfortable

28:06.169 --> 28:08.104
about this case from the beginning.

28:09.173 --> 28:11.106
And when you wrote your letter,

28:11.174 --> 28:12.540
that confirmed it for me.

28:12.610 --> 28:15.238
There was so little to go on.

28:15.312 --> 28:17.542
What do you want me to do?

28:17.615 --> 28:19.241
Find out what was after him.

28:24.989 --> 28:26.512
I'll do my best.

28:26.589 --> 28:29.150
You have my word.

28:29.226 --> 28:31.056
Thank you.

28:31.127 --> 28:32.720
I don't know your name.

28:32.797 --> 28:33.957
Raven.

28:34.031 --> 28:36.263
I'll be in touch with you.

28:38.136 --> 28:40.402
Thank you, Mr. Raven.

28:40.473 --> 28:42.407
Thank you for believing me.

29:37.135 --> 29:38.066
Hello?

29:38.136 --> 29:40.069
My name is Smilla Jaspersen.

29:40.137 --> 29:43.073
I have some questions
about Greenland Mining.

29:43.140 --> 29:46.075
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

29:46.143 --> 29:47.577
I don't work there anymore.

29:54.420 --> 29:55.477
Who is it?

29:55.555 --> 29:58.080
Delivery for Elsa Lubing,
from the florist.

29:58.158 --> 29:59.591
She isn't home.

29:59.660 --> 30:00.920
Could you buzz me in, please?

30:00.993 --> 30:02.427
We have strict instructions

30:02.495 --> 30:04.861
not to open the door
for nonresidents.

30:06.399 --> 30:07.833
They're orchids, Mrs. Schou,

30:07.901 --> 30:09.869
straight off the plane
from Portugal,

30:09.936 --> 30:11.630
and they'll die
if I leave them out here.

30:19.680 --> 30:21.671
I can see you!

30:21.749 --> 30:24.273
You won't get away
with anything.

30:30.090 --> 30:31.614
I remember this letter
quite well.

30:31.693 --> 30:34.458
She said
she had flowers.

30:34.530 --> 30:36.862
It's all right, Mrs. Schou.

30:39.101 --> 30:41.626
At this time of day,
I'm normally in prayer.

30:47.677 --> 30:51.636
Norsaq Christiansen's death
was a tragic accident,

30:51.715 --> 30:53.147
especially for the boy.

30:53.216 --> 30:55.185
A child needs both parents...

30:56.453 --> 30:59.650
one of the reasons
why marriage is sacred.

30:59.723 --> 31:02.555
Mr. Lubing would be
pleased to hear that.

31:02.626 --> 31:03.650
There's no Mr. Lubing.

31:03.727 --> 31:05.991
I am the bride of Jesus.

31:07.698 --> 31:09.462
The boy is dead.

31:09.533 --> 31:12.059
4 days ago,
he fell off a roof.

31:19.178 --> 31:21.306
I met him once.

31:21.380 --> 31:24.612
When I saw him
I knew why it was written:

31:24.684 --> 31:27.118
"Unless we become as little children,

31:27.187 --> 31:29.087
we cannot enter paradise."

31:29.155 --> 31:31.623
I hope his mother
finds her way to Jesus.

31:31.691 --> 31:33.954
Only if one can find Him
at the bottom of a bottle.

31:34.027 --> 31:35.460
Oh, He is everywhere,

31:35.527 --> 31:36.926
even there.

31:36.996 --> 31:39.431
Someone chased the boy
off the roof.

31:39.499 --> 31:41.262
He was murdered.

31:47.041 --> 31:48.632
The devil assumes many forms.

31:48.708 --> 31:52.807
It's one of those forms
that I'm looking for.

31:52.882 --> 31:56.045
Do you know a Professor Loyen?

31:56.119 --> 31:57.210
No.

31:57.286 --> 31:59.687
Was he on the payroll
of Greenland Mining?

31:59.756 --> 32:00.847
I don't remember.

32:00.922 --> 32:03.050
You said that you met Isaiah.

32:03.126 --> 32:04.057
When?

32:04.127 --> 32:06.721
Greenland Mining
began to hire Inuits

32:06.796 --> 32:08.229
for the geological expeditions,

32:08.298 --> 32:11.198
and it was on
one of those expeditions

32:11.266 --> 32:15.135
in the summer of 1993...

32:15.204 --> 32:17.900
on the Gela Alta glacier...

32:20.977 --> 32:22.137
that the father died.

32:22.211 --> 32:24.145
When we awarded the pension,

32:24.213 --> 32:26.647
the son and his mother
came to my office.

32:26.716 --> 32:29.152
How did the father die?

32:30.522 --> 32:31.512
An explosion.

32:33.326 --> 32:37.099
You are interested
in the past, Ms. Jaspersen.

32:37.232 --> 32:40.532
I'm interested in why

32:40.602 --> 32:43.093
the chief accountant
of Greenland Mining

32:43.172 --> 32:44.639
has such a guilty conscience

32:44.707 --> 32:46.369
that she's writing
notes in the margins

32:46.443 --> 32:48.570
of pension awards.

32:51.214 --> 32:53.147
May I see the report

32:53.215 --> 32:54.376
of that expedition?

32:54.451 --> 32:58.148
They're in the safe
in the archive department.

32:58.221 --> 33:00.212
There's nothing to see.

33:01.825 --> 33:03.884
Thou shalt not lie, Ms. Lubing.

33:08.232 --> 33:10.598
I think you should go now.

33:18.310 --> 33:19.674
Why do you think

33:19.745 --> 33:22.475
someone was chasing the little boy?

33:24.016 --> 33:26.143
There was snow on the roof
that he fell from.

33:26.218 --> 33:27.685
I saw his footprints.

33:30.723 --> 33:33.454
The way you have
a sense of God,

33:33.526 --> 33:35.459
I have a sense of snow.

33:42.702 --> 33:43.760
Ms. Jaspersen?

33:46.706 --> 33:47.834
Hello?

33:47.909 --> 33:49.934
Would you come back up
for a moment?

33:52.547 --> 33:53.640
Just now when you left,

33:53.715 --> 33:55.649
I opened... it at
the Book of Revelations.

33:55.717 --> 33:57.651
"And the fifth angel sounded,

33:57.719 --> 34:01.019
and I saw a star
fall from Heaven

34:01.089 --> 34:02.386
onto the earth,

34:02.457 --> 34:04.948
and to him
was given the key

34:05.026 --> 34:08.053
of the bottomless pit."

34:08.130 --> 34:09.291
The key to hell.

34:11.067 --> 34:13.797
Miss Jaspersen,
how far will you go?

34:15.670 --> 34:16.864
Try me.

34:19.208 --> 34:21.108
There are 2 archive sections

34:21.176 --> 34:23.110
in the basement
of our building

34:23.179 --> 34:24.271
on Strand Boulevard.

34:24.347 --> 34:26.612
That's where the expedition
reports are kept.

34:26.685 --> 34:28.618
Naturally, I cannot mention

34:28.686 --> 34:31.246
that there's
a passkey system

34:31.322 --> 34:36.056
nor that the abloy key
on the wall behind you

34:36.128 --> 34:39.358
is for the main entrance
to the building.

34:44.203 --> 34:47.797
Ms. Lubing: Someone has
to guard the gates of hell.

35:13.202 --> 35:14.328
Good doggie.

37:42.696 --> 37:43.685
Ah!

37:56.510 --> 37:58.274
Why were you
following me?

38:00.314 --> 38:02.010
I've been thinking
about what you said...

38:04.219 --> 38:05.186
about the footprints.

38:07.489 --> 38:08.649
If you're right,

38:08.723 --> 38:10.418
you're in danger.

38:17.966 --> 38:19.935
You can, um...

38:20.002 --> 38:21.493
sit.

38:30.681 --> 38:33.946
Isaiah and I were friends,
you know.

38:34.018 --> 38:35.952
He used to make me laugh.

38:36.020 --> 38:38.078
He had this little game

38:38.156 --> 38:41.613
where he used to put his head
in his hands like this,

38:41.692 --> 38:44.126
and when he'd come up,
he would be...

38:44.195 --> 38:45.457
a monkey or a rabbit

38:45.530 --> 38:46.964
or Frankenstein or whatever.

38:47.031 --> 38:48.999
I used to see him, um...

38:49.068 --> 38:51.434
come home sometimes
in a cab.

38:51.503 --> 38:55.131
I... He always seemed so...

38:55.206 --> 38:56.469
so afraid.

38:56.542 --> 38:59.411
They examined him every month
at the hospital.

39:00.981 --> 39:03.449
I think that's what scared him.

39:03.517 --> 39:06.645
Why? What do you think
they were looking for?

39:06.720 --> 39:07.709
I don't know.

39:07.788 --> 39:10.154
Someone shoved
a biopsy needle into him

39:10.224 --> 39:12.351
after he died,

39:12.426 --> 39:14.395
and a very important doctor...

39:20.668 --> 39:24.104
I do... appreciate it when someone

39:24.171 --> 39:26.105
makes me something good.

39:26.174 --> 39:28.074
Thank you.

39:28.143 --> 39:30.407
Don't go.

39:32.180 --> 39:34.113
Isaiah's father
was on an expedition

39:34.182 --> 39:36.115
for Greenland Mining
when he died.

39:36.183 --> 39:39.781
That prick Loyen
was the medical consultant.

39:39.857 --> 39:42.017
I saw his name in here.

39:42.091 --> 39:44.617
Try to read it.

39:44.695 --> 39:47.289
It'll be good for your dyslexia.

39:49.533 --> 39:50.795
Smilla.

39:50.869 --> 39:53.894
Why does such a nice person
have such a rough mouth?

39:53.971 --> 39:56.633
I'm sorry if I've
given you the impression

39:56.707 --> 39:58.641
it's my mouth that's rough.

39:58.709 --> 40:01.543
I try to be rough all over.

40:15.715 --> 40:17.149
Miss Jaspersen,

40:17.217 --> 40:19.209
I'd like to talk to you, please.

40:23.224 --> 40:24.555
Talk.

40:24.626 --> 40:27.755
Would you mind coming
to the station with us?

40:27.830 --> 40:29.262
I would mind.

40:32.734 --> 40:35.135
I'm sorry, you must.

40:37.739 --> 40:40.105
Keep your hands off me.

40:40.175 --> 40:41.472
I'll come with you,

40:41.544 --> 40:43.205
just take your hands off.

40:43.279 --> 40:45.247
Get your hands off me!

40:46.982 --> 40:49.178
You don't have to go
if you don't...

40:49.251 --> 40:51.151
f- f-feel like it.

40:52.756 --> 40:54.656
Will I be driven home?

40:56.259 --> 40:57.693
To your door.

40:57.762 --> 41:00.060
Can't resist a man with manners.

41:00.131 --> 41:01.565
See you later.

41:15.713 --> 41:17.648
"Smilla Jaspersen,

41:17.715 --> 41:20.150
born the 16th of June, 1960,

41:20.219 --> 41:21.652
in Quanaaq, Greenland.

41:21.721 --> 41:23.153
Parents:

41:23.222 --> 41:26.191
Ann Qaavigaaq Jaspersen,
a local hunter,

41:26.258 --> 41:28.658
and Moritz Jaspersen,
American physician.

41:28.728 --> 41:32.459
In 1989, employed by
the Geodetic Institute.

41:32.532 --> 41:34.159
From 89-93,

41:34.233 --> 41:36.669
scientific participant
in expeditions

41:36.738 --> 41:38.672
to the ice cap,
the Arctic Ocean,

41:38.740 --> 41:41.435
and arctic North America."

41:41.509 --> 41:43.501
Various references
are attached...

41:44.646 --> 41:47.274
all of which
state unanimously

41:47.349 --> 41:50.147
that if you want to know
anything about ice,

41:50.218 --> 41:53.620
you would benefit by
consulting Smilla Jaspersen.

41:53.688 --> 41:56.089
Captain Telling here, however,

41:56.159 --> 41:58.126
has gathered some information

41:58.193 --> 42:01.391
of a different character.

42:01.463 --> 42:04.592
Moved to Denmark in 1967

42:04.667 --> 42:06.931
after the death of your mother.

42:07.003 --> 42:09.972
Expelled from 4 boarding schools.

42:10.038 --> 42:12.007
Admitted to Copenhagen University,

42:12.075 --> 42:13.906
asked to leave a year later."

42:13.976 --> 42:17.038
Then there are these
other references,

42:17.114 --> 42:19.948
all of which state
that you have created trouble

42:20.018 --> 42:21.918
wherever you've been.

42:21.986 --> 42:23.545
Arrested twice.

42:23.622 --> 42:24.987
Once in Canada.

42:25.057 --> 42:26.990
I was tagging polar bears.

42:27.059 --> 42:30.152
Bears don't read maps,
so they don't respect

42:30.229 --> 42:31.559
national boundaries.

42:31.629 --> 42:34.064
This paints a picture
of a woman

42:34.133 --> 42:36.566
who has never completed
a course of study,

42:36.635 --> 42:39.627
who has been unemployed
for years, who has no family,

42:39.705 --> 42:42.572
who's created conflict
wherever she's been:

42:42.641 --> 42:45.575
someone who has never
been able to fit in.

42:45.643 --> 42:46.736
Anyone with any sense

42:46.812 --> 42:49.144
would keep a very low profile
in your position.

42:49.215 --> 42:51.081
Is it my clothes
you don't like?

42:51.150 --> 42:52.583
What we don't like

42:52.651 --> 42:54.588
are your fruitless
and damaging attempts

42:54.654 --> 42:57.489
to meddle in the investigation
of this case

42:57.558 --> 43:00.084
which I have already promised you
I would look into.

43:00.161 --> 43:02.130
I remember what you promised to me.

43:02.196 --> 43:04.164
Screw you, Raven.

43:11.573 --> 43:14.770
These belong to Greenland Mining.

43:16.111 --> 43:18.272
We found them in your flat.

43:21.116 --> 43:24.051
Imprisonment in
a little soundproof room

43:24.120 --> 43:26.553
with no windows is,
I've been told,

43:26.621 --> 43:28.055
particularly difficult

43:28.123 --> 43:30.455
if you've been brought up
in Greenland.

43:32.128 --> 43:35.155
This would cause you
extreme distress.

43:35.232 --> 43:37.224
It's true, is it not?

43:41.972 --> 43:45.067
They say it's something about

43:45.143 --> 43:47.111
those vast spaces,

43:47.179 --> 43:49.238
the horizon.

43:53.653 --> 43:55.210
That what it is?

43:55.287 --> 43:57.687
All that space.

44:06.666 --> 44:08.030
Good.

44:08.099 --> 44:11.091
Then we mustn't
let that happen.

44:11.170 --> 44:13.402
We've reached an agreement, then.

44:19.146 --> 44:21.046
Will you say that louder, please,

44:21.114 --> 44:23.310
so I can hear you?

44:26.522 --> 44:27.579
Yeah.

44:27.655 --> 44:30.123
We've reached an agreement.

44:33.629 --> 44:35.596
You may go home now.

45:58.552 --> 46:00.385
Smilla, this is your father.

46:00.454 --> 46:02.423
Could you come for lunch
tomorrow at the club?

46:02.490 --> 46:03.548
Call me...

46:20.610 --> 46:23.546
Anything is better
than suicide?

46:23.614 --> 46:26.549
How can you have
6 spelling mistakes in 5 words?

46:26.616 --> 46:30.383
I'm not suicidal.
Suicide is for cowards.

46:30.455 --> 46:33.049
Sometimes one just wants
to be left alone, that's all.

46:33.124 --> 46:35.559
There was an earlier
expedition in '66.

46:35.627 --> 46:38.027
There was an accident
that time, too.

46:38.097 --> 46:40.064
2 of the 8 men died.

46:40.131 --> 46:43.065
Loyen was on both expeditions.

46:43.134 --> 46:46.069
I can't be part of this.

46:46.137 --> 46:49.040
I came to tell you that.

46:49.109 --> 46:52.204
I'm out of it. Good luck.

46:52.279 --> 46:53.211
Smilla.

46:55.515 --> 46:56.505
W...

46:57.484 --> 47:00.078
What did they d...

47:00.154 --> 47:02.088
do to you?

47:02.156 --> 47:04.182
They threatened to lock me up.

47:04.259 --> 47:06.590
And I can't be locked up.

47:06.659 --> 47:09.094
I'm quite ashamed.
Really, I am.

47:09.163 --> 47:11.098
I just can't be locked up.
Don't.

47:11.166 --> 47:12.928
It's O.K.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.867
Do you think I need you
to understand me?

47:18.874 --> 47:20.808
God. Sorry.

47:22.276 --> 47:24.040
What is it about you

47:24.112 --> 47:26.546
that always makes me
want to insult you?

47:26.615 --> 47:29.552
When my father
first brought me here

47:29.620 --> 47:31.053
from Greenland,

47:31.121 --> 47:33.282
I refused to sleep indoors.

47:36.126 --> 47:38.560
I couldn't stand it:
the heat.

47:38.629 --> 47:41.599
I was used to the snow,
the air.

47:43.134 --> 47:45.101
I made a tent
out on the lawn.

47:45.169 --> 47:47.069
Poor Moritz.

47:47.137 --> 47:48.570
He was so embarrassed.

47:48.639 --> 47:51.574
Even now my idea of hell
is to be locked up.

47:51.642 --> 47:53.075
Where...

47:53.144 --> 47:54.891
Where was your mother?

47:55.026 --> 47:56.755
She went out one day
to hunt.

47:56.828 --> 47:59.763
They found her kayak
a few days later.

47:59.831 --> 48:02.061
The side had been staved in.

48:02.133 --> 48:04.067
No one who falls
into the water in Greenland

48:04.135 --> 48:05.192
ever comes up again.

48:05.269 --> 48:08.206
The sea is less than
39 degrees Fahrenheit,

48:08.274 --> 48:09.706
and at that temperature,

48:09.776 --> 48:11.767
all the processes of
decomposition stop.

48:11.845 --> 48:13.210
- How old were you?
- 6.

48:13.279 --> 48:14.610
That's when you came here?

48:14.681 --> 48:16.614
That's when my father
brought me here.

48:16.683 --> 48:18.514
But you were never happy here?

48:18.585 --> 48:21.520
The only thing
that makes me truly happy

48:21.588 --> 48:25.024
is mathematics, snow, ice,

48:25.092 --> 48:26.251
numbers.

48:28.962 --> 48:33.023
To me, the number system
is like human life.

48:33.099 --> 48:36.035
First you have
the natural numbers,

48:36.103 --> 48:39.037
the ones that are whole
and positive,

48:39.106 --> 48:42.041
like the numbers
of a small child.

48:42.109 --> 48:44.043
But human consciousness expands,

48:44.111 --> 48:46.046
and the child
discovers longing.

48:46.115 --> 48:50.553
Do you know the mathematical
expression for longing?

48:50.621 --> 48:52.952
Negative numbers.

48:53.023 --> 48:54.922
The formalization of the feeling

48:54.992 --> 48:56.856
that you're missing something.

48:56.926 --> 48:59.861
Then the child discovers
the in-between spaces

48:59.930 --> 49:02.056
between stones,
between people,

49:02.131 --> 49:04.396
between numbers,
and that produces fractions.

49:04.468 --> 49:06.800
But it's like a kind of madness,

49:06.870 --> 49:09.065
because it doesn't even stop there.

49:09.139 --> 49:11.073
It never stops. There are numbers

49:11.141 --> 49:13.507
that we can't even
begin to comprehend.

49:13.576 --> 49:15.341
Mathematics is a vast,
open landscape.

49:15.413 --> 49:19.008
You head towards the horizon
that is always receding...

49:19.083 --> 49:21.016
like Greenland.

49:21.084 --> 49:24.420
And that's... that's what
I can't live without.

49:24.491 --> 49:25.515
Smilla.

49:25.592 --> 49:27.525
That's why I can't be locked up.

49:27.593 --> 49:29.619
Can I kiss you?

49:35.801 --> 49:36.734
Smilla.

49:38.838 --> 49:40.634
It's Christmas Eve.

49:43.510 --> 49:45.034
Toast with me.

49:45.112 --> 49:46.578
To what?

49:50.116 --> 49:51.607
To Isaiah.

49:56.122 --> 49:57.919
Don't you understand?

49:59.459 --> 50:02.054
My heart is broken.

50:02.129 --> 50:04.998
Then to a merry Christmas.

50:05.068 --> 50:07.161
And a happy New Year.

50:21.050 --> 50:22.449
Smilla.

50:23.686 --> 50:25.382
Merry Christmas, Smilla.

50:27.056 --> 50:29.081
Juliane, you look wonderful.

50:29.158 --> 50:31.353
2 days, Smilla. No drink.

50:36.834 --> 50:38.892
Merry Christmas, Smilla.

50:38.968 --> 50:41.028
He hid this box good.

50:41.105 --> 50:43.098
You should keep it now.

50:45.677 --> 50:46.668
Open it.

50:49.682 --> 50:51.274
His Walkman.

50:51.351 --> 50:54.615
You gave it to him
last Christmas. Remember?

50:54.687 --> 50:56.678
It was his best present.

50:58.691 --> 51:00.626
They let Isaiah go with them

51:00.693 --> 51:02.559
on the expedition?

51:02.629 --> 51:04.061
The Greenland Mining people

51:04.131 --> 51:06.122
were looking for men in Greenland.

51:06.199 --> 51:07.632
My husband signed on.

51:07.701 --> 51:10.726
They told us that
Isaiah could go with him,

51:10.804 --> 51:12.567
so how dangerous could it be?

51:12.639 --> 51:15.163
They were digging inside a glacier.

51:15.241 --> 51:17.437
Something must have happened.

51:17.510 --> 51:18.943
Isaiah was outside.

51:19.012 --> 51:21.072
They took his dad in a helicopter

51:21.150 --> 51:25.382
to the hospital,
and there his dad died.

51:25.455 --> 51:27.388
He never saw him again.

51:27.456 --> 51:30.085
What really happened, Juliane?

51:30.160 --> 51:32.093
Be careful, Smilla.

51:32.162 --> 51:35.097
It was not an accident.

51:35.165 --> 51:37.599
There was something
in the melt water.

51:37.666 --> 51:38.997
Isaiah told me so.

51:39.069 --> 51:40.536
In the melt water?

51:40.603 --> 51:42.036
How would Isaiah know?

51:42.105 --> 51:43.537
His daddy told him.

51:43.606 --> 51:45.096
But he couldn't have done.

51:45.175 --> 51:48.611
You just said they flew
your husband away...

51:48.677 --> 51:49.610
Smilla, please.

51:49.679 --> 51:51.112
...in a helicopter.

51:51.181 --> 51:53.581
Smilla, please.
No more questions.

51:53.650 --> 51:55.117
Who brought Isaiah home?

51:56.353 --> 51:58.617
This doctor. Loyen.

51:58.689 --> 52:00.624
Was Isaiah sick, Juliane?

52:00.693 --> 52:03.059
Is that why Loyen
examined him every month?

52:03.129 --> 52:04.653
Smilla, please.

52:04.731 --> 52:07.028
No more questions.

52:22.647 --> 52:24.583
I'm scared.

52:26.152 --> 52:28.086
But I'll do it anyway.

52:28.154 --> 52:29.917
I knew you would.

52:33.660 --> 52:36.595
The Inuit believe
that if you kill something,

52:36.663 --> 52:38.220
you offend its soul.

52:38.298 --> 52:41.269
I need his soul to be at peace.

52:44.974 --> 52:46.805
Did you ever hear the phrase,

52:46.876 --> 52:48.309
"She was so drunk

52:48.378 --> 52:50.208
that she didn't know
what she was doing"?

52:50.279 --> 52:51.610
That's why I'm doing this

52:51.680 --> 52:53.170
before I drink anything.

53:21.146 --> 53:22.170
Go back inside.

53:22.246 --> 53:23.179
Smilla.

53:23.247 --> 53:24.579
What?

53:24.650 --> 53:27.881
Don't answer the phone
from now on.

53:55.281 --> 53:56.611
Smilla.

53:56.683 --> 53:59.381
What a surprise.
We weren't expecting you.

53:59.455 --> 54:01.513
I thought you didn't
celebrate Christmas.

54:01.590 --> 54:02.523
I don't.

54:02.591 --> 54:04.218
So what do you
celebrate, Smilla?

54:04.292 --> 54:05.623
Oh, I celebrate the loners,

54:05.694 --> 54:07.127
the outcasts,

54:07.195 --> 54:08.662
the shy girl with pimples,

54:08.731 --> 54:10.129
the fattest boy in class,

54:10.199 --> 54:11.894
dyslexics, the stutterers,

54:11.968 --> 54:13.094
the premature ejaculators.

54:13.169 --> 54:15.033
You're such a freak.

54:16.638 --> 54:18.072
Some men died
on an expedition

54:18.140 --> 54:19.573
to the west coast of Greenland.

54:19.642 --> 54:21.075
I need to know why.

54:21.143 --> 54:23.077
Will you look at them for me?

54:23.146 --> 54:26.080
I thought you wanted
to have lunch with us.

54:26.148 --> 54:27.581
Do this for me, Moritz.

54:27.650 --> 54:30.619
I'm happy today for
the first time in ages.

54:33.089 --> 54:35.114
The man with the white hair.

54:35.190 --> 54:36.318
Do you know him?

54:36.393 --> 54:38.454
Dr. Andreas Tork.

54:39.732 --> 54:41.597
Scientist.

54:41.667 --> 54:43.191
Leading specialist

54:43.269 --> 54:44.997
in arctic mineralogy.

54:48.607 --> 54:50.405
Powerful man.

54:50.475 --> 54:53.070
Very ambitious.
Head of Greenland Mining.

54:55.481 --> 54:58.109
Why? You want to meet him?

54:58.183 --> 55:01.118
Why would someone
examine a child

55:01.185 --> 55:03.017
every month at a hospital?

55:03.088 --> 55:05.683
If he'd been exposed
to a virus, to, uh...

55:05.759 --> 55:07.784
Why would someone
shove a biopsy needle

55:07.861 --> 55:09.123
into a dead 6-year-old?

55:09.194 --> 55:11.788
Oh, gross. I'm not eating now.
Forget it.

55:11.864 --> 55:12.853
Answer me.

55:12.932 --> 55:14.559
I'm not eating
a bloody thing, Moritz.

55:14.633 --> 55:16.069
I don't know, Smilla.

55:16.138 --> 55:18.732
To measure the progress
of something... you know.

55:22.644 --> 55:23.575
Thank you.

55:23.645 --> 55:26.017
Call me when you've
looked at that.

55:48.139 --> 55:49.183
I was following you.

55:49.277 --> 55:50.601
He recognized me
from the funeral.

55:50.684 --> 55:51.435
He stopped me and asked me

55:51.518 --> 55:54.188
how Juliane was doing. That's all.

55:54.271 --> 55:54.938
You were with him.

55:55.022 --> 55:57.357
I was not with him!
We started to talk.

55:57.441 --> 55:58.400
I thought I could learn more about

55:58.484 --> 56:00.986
Greenland Mining.

56:01.069 --> 56:03.590
I was following you there.

56:03.658 --> 56:04.784
Smilla.

56:06.326 --> 56:07.260
Smilla.

56:08.496 --> 56:10.727
Don't you trust me?

56:12.934 --> 56:14.027
No.

56:35.626 --> 56:37.560
Juliane:
I told you, we have nothing!

56:37.628 --> 56:39.528
Nothing!

56:39.597 --> 56:41.827
You fucking bastard!

56:41.899 --> 56:43.764
Oh...

56:43.834 --> 56:45.166
Leave us alone!

56:46.637 --> 56:47.934
Isaiah.

56:48.005 --> 56:49.564
What happened?

56:52.144 --> 56:53.076
It's O.K.

56:53.145 --> 56:54.510
It's me, Smilla.

57:01.018 --> 57:02.042
Isaiah.

57:54.411 --> 57:55.343
Smilla?

59:10.750 --> 59:12.743
How did you find me?

59:12.820 --> 59:14.219
It wasn't hard.

59:14.288 --> 59:16.553
You're considered
the best ear in Copenhagen.

59:16.625 --> 59:19.353
You called about a tape.

59:19.425 --> 59:22.089
It was left next to
an electrical box.

59:22.163 --> 59:24.188
Maybe that's what affected
the sound on it.

59:24.265 --> 59:26.062
I can't make it out.

59:30.805 --> 59:33.671
Sounds like some kind
of an announcement.

59:38.379 --> 59:39.642
I can't hear anything.

59:39.714 --> 59:40.975
That's because you haven't

59:41.048 --> 59:42.573
trained your ear.

59:48.658 --> 59:50.320
Hear it now?

59:50.394 --> 59:52.328
It's not live.

59:53.530 --> 59:55.828
It's coming from a loudspeaker.

59:55.899 --> 59:57.925
An intercom.

01:00:02.372 --> 01:00:05.341
Maybe in a hospital somewhere.

01:00:05.410 --> 01:00:08.277
Can you hear
the doctor's beeper?

01:00:08.346 --> 01:00:09.472
No.

01:00:09.547 --> 01:00:12.414
And there's someone
whispering, too.

01:00:12.482 --> 01:00:14.075
What's he saying?

01:00:15.587 --> 01:00:17.520
He's in a lot of pain.

01:00:18.856 --> 01:00:21.690
There's an EEG
in there as well,

01:00:21.758 --> 01:00:23.226
monitoring his heart.

01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:27.120
What's he saying?

01:00:41.915 --> 01:00:43.816
It's difficult to say.

01:00:43.884 --> 01:00:47.047
It's an East Greenlandic dialect.

01:00:51.158 --> 01:00:52.319
He's...

01:00:52.394 --> 01:00:56.489
He's talking to his son...
Isaiah.

01:00:56.564 --> 01:00:58.259
He's trying to tell

01:00:58.333 --> 01:01:00.699
what happened
in an ice cave.

01:01:04.438 --> 01:01:06.269
Did you hear that?

01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:08.971
That's a Sikorsky R17 overhead.

01:01:09.045 --> 01:01:11.276
Late '93, early '94.

01:01:11.348 --> 01:01:13.213
This must be the hospital

01:01:13.283 --> 01:01:15.911
in the American air base in Thule.

01:01:15.986 --> 01:01:18.352
I'm amazed you can
conclude so much

01:01:18.422 --> 01:01:19.911
from so little.

01:01:21.291 --> 01:01:23.816
Blindness sharpens
the sense of hearing.

01:01:23.894 --> 01:01:25.156
Is there any way

01:01:25.229 --> 01:01:26.889
you can clean up the tape?

01:01:26.964 --> 01:01:29.126
Come back in an hour.

01:01:36.974 --> 01:01:38.669
Woman: Are you
finished with that?

01:01:38.742 --> 01:01:40.232
Man: Yeah, that's all right.

01:01:50.323 --> 01:01:51.449
Hello?

01:01:52.659 --> 01:01:55.594
Were you really
just following me?

01:01:55.662 --> 01:01:56.856
Yes.

01:02:00.802 --> 01:02:03.202
I want to kiss you again.

01:02:03.271 --> 01:02:04.760
Would you like that?

01:02:04.838 --> 01:02:05.806
Yes.

01:02:06.873 --> 01:02:08.773
Smilla, where are you?

01:02:10.378 --> 01:02:12.573
Smilla?

01:02:35.239 --> 01:02:36.670
Mr. Licht?

01:03:18.251 --> 01:03:20.220
Open the door!

01:03:20.288 --> 01:03:21.218
Open it!

01:03:21.355 --> 01:03:22.821
Open it!

01:05:10.539 --> 01:05:11.596
Talk to me.

01:05:13.342 --> 01:05:16.436
You have to talk now, Smilla.

01:05:16.512 --> 01:05:19.003
Snow. Talk to me about snow.

01:05:19.081 --> 01:05:21.276
So many.
There's too many kinds.

01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:22.817
Say them!

01:05:26.223 --> 01:05:27.314
Qanik.

01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:29.791
What's that? Hmm?

01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:31.157
Talk.

01:05:31.228 --> 01:05:33.789
It's falling snow.

01:05:33.864 --> 01:05:35.525
What other kinds?

01:05:35.599 --> 01:05:37.759
Aquilluqqag.

01:05:37.833 --> 01:05:39.096
It's wet, wet snow.

01:05:39.169 --> 01:05:40.798
It's not firm enough

01:05:40.873 --> 01:05:43.138
to build a snow house with.

01:05:43.209 --> 01:05:44.800
You must never use it for that.

01:05:44.877 --> 01:05:45.969
I won't.

01:05:46.045 --> 01:05:47.306
Promise me?

01:05:47.379 --> 01:05:48.311
I promise.

01:05:48.379 --> 01:05:50.780
More. Come on, more.

01:05:50.883 --> 01:05:52.407
Did you hear the tape?

01:05:52.485 --> 01:05:54.315
They killed Isaiah for it.

01:05:55.821 --> 01:05:57.083
Did you get it?

01:05:57.157 --> 01:05:58.835
No.

01:06:00.336 --> 01:06:02.998
He could have made it.

01:06:03.072 --> 01:06:04.631
Not like Smilla, the fake.

01:06:04.709 --> 01:06:07.370
The fake Greenlander

01:06:07.444 --> 01:06:10.811
with her fine clothes
and manners.

01:06:12.315 --> 01:06:14.078
I let him die.

01:06:14.151 --> 01:06:15.709
No, you didn't.

01:06:15.785 --> 01:06:17.811
The tablets will start to work

01:06:17.888 --> 01:06:19.152
in a few minutes.

01:06:19.224 --> 01:06:21.125
Then it won't hurt so much.

01:06:21.194 --> 01:06:23.526
You must sleep now.

01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:29.825
When I was little,

01:06:29.903 --> 01:06:32.337
I knew where I was going.

01:06:32.404 --> 01:06:33.736
Yes.

01:06:35.108 --> 01:06:37.406
I'm very lost now.

01:06:55.195 --> 01:06:57.163
Stay with me.

01:06:57.231 --> 01:06:58.859
I'm right here.

01:07:00.136 --> 01:07:02.434
Lie down with me.

01:07:46.752 --> 01:07:47.980
Kinngusaqattaarpoq.

01:07:49.321 --> 01:07:50.549
What does it mean?

01:07:50.623 --> 01:07:51.749
Say it.

01:07:51.824 --> 01:07:53.417
I can't say it.

01:07:53.493 --> 01:07:57.485
To practice rolling over
in a kayak.

01:07:58.964 --> 01:08:00.398
Makittaqanngitsoq.

01:08:00.467 --> 01:08:02.128
Pff. Jesus.

01:08:05.671 --> 01:08:07.901
Someone who has never
mastered the art

01:08:07.973 --> 01:08:10.205
of rolling over in a kayak.

01:08:12.579 --> 01:08:14.946
Umiiarneq.

01:08:16.350 --> 01:08:19.081
A shipwrecked person.

01:08:22.090 --> 01:08:24.354
You're not shipwrecked.

01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:32.461
Pilluaqaanga.

01:08:33.801 --> 01:08:35.930
It's to be deeply happy.

01:08:42.478 --> 01:08:45.173
I'm sorry, I have to go.

01:08:45.247 --> 01:08:47.078
Smilla?

01:08:47.149 --> 01:08:49.085
You cannot stay
in your apartment.

01:08:49.152 --> 01:08:51.586
They've already tried
to kill you once,

01:08:51.654 --> 01:08:53.587
and if they know
you're alive,

01:08:53.656 --> 01:08:56.354
they won't make the
same mistake again.

01:08:56.428 --> 01:08:58.363
Now go to your
father's house.

01:08:58.430 --> 01:09:00.661
You'll be safer with him.

01:09:11.377 --> 01:09:13.277
I've seen that car before.

01:09:14.714 --> 01:09:16.703
Don't turn around.

01:10:38.535 --> 01:10:42.404
They found something in 1966.

01:10:43.708 --> 01:10:45.039
Something went wrong,

01:10:45.109 --> 01:10:46.873
and they waited 30 years

01:10:46.945 --> 01:10:49.470
before they sent
another expedition.

01:10:49.548 --> 01:10:51.482
But then something else went wrong.

01:10:51.551 --> 01:10:53.279
There was an accident.

01:10:53.352 --> 01:10:54.717
4 men died.

01:10:55.922 --> 01:10:58.322
One of them was Isaiah's father.

01:10:58.391 --> 01:11:00.052
So before Isaiah's father dies,

01:11:00.125 --> 01:11:02.321
he sends his son a tape

01:11:02.395 --> 01:11:04.523
telling him what really happened.

01:11:04.597 --> 01:11:07.032
Tork comes looking for the tape,

01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:10.070
they kill Isaiah to get it.

01:11:10.137 --> 01:11:13.230
And then they killed
the man on the boat.

01:11:15.644 --> 01:11:17.508
There's got to be something else

01:11:17.579 --> 01:11:18.978
on that tape.

01:11:19.046 --> 01:11:20.845
Like what they really found

01:11:20.915 --> 01:11:22.850
up there in Greenland.

01:11:22.919 --> 01:11:25.547
They're planning to go up again.

01:11:25.621 --> 01:11:27.350
They've had to wait until now

01:11:27.422 --> 01:11:30.290
for the pack ice to melt
in the Davis Strait.

01:11:31.527 --> 01:11:33.155
I know a man...

01:11:33.229 --> 01:11:35.130
who knows about boats.

01:11:40.924 --> 01:11:43.357
Norsaq Christiansen, dead,

01:11:43.425 --> 01:11:46.691
on the Gela Alta glacier,
July 1993.

01:11:46.764 --> 01:11:48.594
Hmm.

01:11:48.666 --> 01:11:50.223
It says in the report

01:11:50.301 --> 01:11:51.893
that he died in an explosion,

01:11:51.969 --> 01:11:54.869
but I don't think that's
what killed these men.

01:11:56.675 --> 01:12:00.110
These are enlargements
I made from the negatives.

01:12:02.381 --> 01:12:06.011
You can see what remains
of the liver,

01:12:06.083 --> 01:12:08.644
the esophagus, stomach.

01:12:08.721 --> 01:12:10.314
This is the heart...

01:12:10.389 --> 01:12:11.549
what's left of it.

01:12:11.625 --> 01:12:12.818
Smilla?

01:12:14.194 --> 01:12:18.324
Do you notice anything
unusual here?

01:12:19.799 --> 01:12:22.268
Something's got
into the heart.

01:12:22.335 --> 01:12:24.065
But what is it?

01:12:24.138 --> 01:12:25.435
This... This is so gross.

01:12:25.506 --> 01:12:27.371
What's it got to do with us?

01:12:27.441 --> 01:12:29.602
Get her out of here.

01:12:30.946 --> 01:12:33.344
Darling, why don't you
wait for me outside?

01:12:33.415 --> 01:12:34.713
I'll join you later.

01:12:34.783 --> 01:12:35.716
But it's disgusting.

01:12:35.784 --> 01:12:37.843
What's it got to do with us?

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.854
I'll be with you soon.

01:12:39.922 --> 01:12:41.116
Please. Please.

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:42.658
Smilla?

01:12:43.794 --> 01:12:46.558
This is the arctic worm.

01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:49.861
Drancunculus Borealis.

01:12:51.001 --> 01:12:52.127
Prehistoric.

01:12:53.438 --> 01:12:56.703
No one has seen pictures
of them before.

01:12:56.773 --> 01:12:59.299
Loyen must have
photographed them.

01:13:00.412 --> 01:13:01.969
You see, the female worm

01:13:02.047 --> 01:13:05.140
entered these men's vital organs.

01:13:08.588 --> 01:13:09.815
The uterus burst.

01:13:09.889 --> 01:13:12.584
There were 10 million
larvae released.

01:13:12.659 --> 01:13:14.593
The men go into toxic shock.

01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:17.597
They die on the spot.
But it's very strange.

01:13:17.663 --> 01:13:20.327
Parasites don't usually
kill their hosts.

01:13:20.401 --> 01:13:22.062
It's very bad manners.

01:13:24.338 --> 01:13:27.331
But I thought the worm was extinct.

01:13:27.408 --> 01:13:29.536
I thought so too, Smilla.

01:13:30.611 --> 01:13:31.874
But the question is,

01:13:31.948 --> 01:13:34.609
what brought them back to life?

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:41.116
Why are you getting
involved in this?

01:13:41.189 --> 01:13:43.420
I told you before...
a child died.

01:13:43.493 --> 01:13:45.359
It's my New Year's resolution

01:13:45.428 --> 01:13:47.624
to make someone pay.

01:13:49.465 --> 01:13:53.367
This friend of yours
who dropped you off.

01:13:53.437 --> 01:13:55.735
Is he also involved?

01:13:55.806 --> 01:13:57.205
I don't know.

01:13:58.377 --> 01:14:00.402
I don't know him
very well.

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.311
He has a repair shop

01:14:04.382 --> 01:14:07.079
which he never goes to.

01:14:07.152 --> 01:14:09.085
His hands
are much too clean.

01:14:09.153 --> 01:14:10.587
He lies to me.

01:14:10.657 --> 01:14:12.817
I don't know what he does.

01:14:12.891 --> 01:14:14.723
Are you in love with him?

01:14:16.029 --> 01:14:17.825
I've been trying to avoid it

01:14:17.898 --> 01:14:18.957
all my life,

01:14:19.032 --> 01:14:20.090
so now that it's here,

01:14:20.166 --> 01:14:21.963
I just want to renounce it.

01:14:22.035 --> 01:14:23.594
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:14:23.670 --> 01:14:26.231
I'm tired of
wondering why it is

01:14:26.307 --> 01:14:28.537
that every day
I'm on this earth

01:14:28.608 --> 01:14:29.542
I'm in exile.

01:14:29.610 --> 01:14:32.272
I'm sorry you're so angry.

01:14:34.483 --> 01:14:37.475
I'm sorry
I made you do things.

01:14:37.553 --> 01:14:40.350
Is it time for confession, Moritz?

01:14:40.422 --> 01:14:42.857
What things did you make me do?

01:14:42.925 --> 01:14:44.918
I made you leave your country.

01:14:44.994 --> 01:14:46.791
What were you supposed to do,

01:14:46.862 --> 01:14:47.886
leave me there?

01:14:47.964 --> 01:14:50.024
I punished you, because
your mother was dead.

01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:54.764
I'd look at you,
and I'd see her face.

01:14:54.837 --> 01:14:56.396
I never loved anyone

01:14:56.474 --> 01:14:59.204
the way I loved your mother.

01:14:59.277 --> 01:15:02.644
Benja will be sorry to hear that.

01:15:04.883 --> 01:15:07.317
It's late, Smilla. I'm going to bed.

01:15:31.914 --> 01:15:35.543
All day today I thought
about your hands on me.

01:15:37.252 --> 01:15:39.152
Your mouth on my mouth.

01:15:53.437 --> 01:15:54.870
This friend of yours, Lander.

01:15:54.939 --> 01:15:56.200
What does he do?

01:15:56.273 --> 01:15:57.502
He owns the place.

01:15:59.610 --> 01:16:01.840
Now, what can I do for you?

01:16:01.913 --> 01:16:03.813
I need to know where
the boat is going...

01:16:03.881 --> 01:16:05.816
why it's going,
and who's behind it.

01:16:05.884 --> 01:16:07.216
The ship you saw, the Kronos,

01:16:07.286 --> 01:16:08.548
it's classified ice class.

01:16:08.619 --> 01:16:10.851
They spent an incredible
amount of money

01:16:10.923 --> 01:16:12.322
getting her ready.

01:16:12.392 --> 01:16:14.326
Whatever they're after
has to be very lucrative

01:16:14.395 --> 01:16:16.328
for them to recoup
the investment they've made.

01:16:16.397 --> 01:16:17.385
But you don't know...

01:16:17.464 --> 01:16:19.897
Normally a ship is
chartered with a crew.

01:16:19.967 --> 01:16:21.229
But in this situation,

01:16:21.301 --> 01:16:23.326
you would prefer
a bare-boat charter...

01:16:23.404 --> 01:16:24.736
a ship and nothing else.

01:16:24.804 --> 01:16:26.330
Then you find a captain.

01:16:26.407 --> 01:16:29.343
He has to be a special
kind of person,

01:16:29.411 --> 01:16:32.345
the kind you can take aside,
and over a full glass

01:16:32.414 --> 01:16:33.847
tell him that his wages

01:16:33.915 --> 01:16:35.679
will be a little
out of the ordinary.

01:16:35.751 --> 01:16:37.184
On the other hand,

01:16:37.252 --> 01:16:39.187
you need all his tact
and sensitivity.

01:16:39.255 --> 01:16:41.314
Where would someone
find such a person?

01:16:42.459 --> 01:16:44.222
Right here.

01:16:45.494 --> 01:16:48.225
That gentleman over there.

01:16:48.298 --> 01:16:49.731
Captain Sigmund Lukas.

01:16:49.801 --> 01:16:51.358
A very, very skilled
German seaman.

01:16:51.436 --> 01:16:53.995
Knows the North Atlantic
like no one else.

01:16:54.072 --> 01:16:55.538
Doesn't drink, but he gambles.

01:16:55.605 --> 01:16:58.473
He no longer has
a home or a family.

01:16:58.543 --> 01:17:00.569
And now he's for sale,

01:17:00.645 --> 01:17:02.579
if the amount is big enough.

01:17:02.647 --> 01:17:04.081
If he's so broke,

01:17:04.149 --> 01:17:05.514
whose money is he playing with?

01:17:05.583 --> 01:17:06.846
Uncle Lander's money, honey.

01:17:06.919 --> 01:17:11.185
That's why he's going
to be nice to you.

01:17:11.256 --> 01:17:12.315
This is not a game.

01:17:12.391 --> 01:17:14.325
If you go on board that boat,

01:17:14.394 --> 01:17:15.325
they'll kill you.

01:17:15.395 --> 01:17:17.328
I need to know
what happened to him.

01:17:17.397 --> 01:17:19.490
You don't even know
where the boat is going.

01:17:19.566 --> 01:17:20.555
Wherever the boat is going,

01:17:20.633 --> 01:17:23.433
I'll find out why they killed Isaiah.

01:17:26.474 --> 01:17:27.840
They've come for you.

01:17:27.908 --> 01:17:29.341
Just keep walking.

01:17:29.409 --> 01:17:31.072
Don't turn around.

01:17:38.422 --> 01:17:39.852
Lander'll be waiting outside.

01:17:39.921 --> 01:17:42.254
Go to your father's house.

01:17:42.326 --> 01:17:44.316
Wait there.
I'll meet you there.

01:17:48.331 --> 01:17:49.389
Man: Perfect!

01:17:49.465 --> 01:17:50.932
Miss Jaspersen?

01:17:51.001 --> 01:17:52.126
Miss Jaspersen.

01:17:53.937 --> 01:17:55.098
Go.

01:17:55.172 --> 01:17:56.935
- Open this door!
- Go!

01:18:12.057 --> 01:18:15.288
I need you to help me
get on the Kronos.

01:18:15.361 --> 01:18:17.591
What makes you think
I can help?

01:18:17.663 --> 01:18:19.359
Just talk to Lukas.

01:18:21.835 --> 01:18:23.097
My life is shit.

01:18:23.170 --> 01:18:24.433
But whatever it's worth

01:18:24.505 --> 01:18:26.439
I owe to your boyfriend,

01:18:26.507 --> 01:18:28.169
so the answer is no.

01:18:30.578 --> 01:18:33.446
I'm going whether
you help me or not.

01:18:35.584 --> 01:18:37.552
Wait, wait, wait.

01:18:37.619 --> 01:18:39.519
You scare me, honey.
Other women,

01:18:39.589 --> 01:18:41.556
it's all threat,
and no action.

01:18:41.623 --> 01:18:42.716
You, I believe.

01:18:42.792 --> 01:18:44.020
You'll go anyway

01:18:44.093 --> 01:18:46.323
and get yourself
really fucked.

01:18:46.396 --> 01:18:48.522
So give me a call
when you're ready.

01:18:48.598 --> 01:18:50.293
Thank you, Lander.

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:20.268
O.K., thank you very much.

01:19:20.337 --> 01:19:23.101
It's the door
straight on.

01:19:24.608 --> 01:19:25.871
Benja?

01:19:37.823 --> 01:19:39.084
You don't belong here.

01:19:39.157 --> 01:19:41.319
They're going
to take you away.

01:19:41.393 --> 01:19:43.054
You can't run away
your whole life.

01:19:43.128 --> 01:19:44.253
We'll get you
a good lawyer.

01:19:44.329 --> 01:19:46.059
They'll find a way
to kill me,

01:19:46.131 --> 01:19:47.827
or I'll just have
an accident.

01:19:47.902 --> 01:19:49.835
I was resisting arrest.
I tried to escape.

01:19:49.903 --> 01:19:51.062
And you'll spend
your wretched life

01:19:51.137 --> 01:19:53.003
knowing you could
have saved me.

01:19:53.074 --> 01:19:54.800
Are you going,
or should I get...

01:19:54.874 --> 01:19:56.068
Give us a minute.

01:19:56.143 --> 01:19:57.076
But you promised me!

01:19:57.143 --> 01:19:58.111
Quiet!

01:19:58.180 --> 01:20:00.671
She is crazy!
I can't take this anymore!

01:20:00.749 --> 01:20:02.011
Will you be quiet?

01:20:02.083 --> 01:20:04.449
What do you
want me to do?

01:20:04.519 --> 01:20:06.510
Drive your car
to the back

01:20:06.587 --> 01:20:08.181
so I can get in,

01:20:08.256 --> 01:20:10.190
and lie down
on the floor,

01:20:10.258 --> 01:20:11.454
and then cover me.

01:20:23.074 --> 01:20:24.040
Lander.

01:20:24.106 --> 01:20:26.075
Where are you?

01:20:26.144 --> 01:20:27.940
Meet me at the marina.

01:20:28.012 --> 01:20:30.537
Thank you, Lander.
I'm coming.

01:20:30.615 --> 01:20:33.014
Once you drive off,

01:20:33.084 --> 01:20:35.109
I'll send them
after you.

01:20:44.630 --> 01:20:45.961
Benja.

01:20:47.434 --> 01:20:50.165
Leave me alone.

01:21:08.557 --> 01:21:10.752
Emergency at the hospital.

01:21:14.998 --> 01:21:18.298
Good night.
Thanks for your help.

01:21:26.677 --> 01:21:28.770
I wanted peace
and quiet so badly,

01:21:28.847 --> 01:21:30.405
wanted my family
around me,

01:21:30.482 --> 01:21:32.415
but I never
achieved that.

01:21:34.619 --> 01:21:37.281
I don't want to let
you go, Smilla.

01:22:00.247 --> 01:22:01.910
I'll take that.

01:22:27.777 --> 01:22:29.040
Thank you, Lander.

01:22:29.113 --> 01:22:32.048
Change your mind and
come back with me.

01:22:33.517 --> 01:22:35.212
I can't do that.

01:23:00.715 --> 01:23:01.977
Man: Ooh, sweet thing.

01:23:02.049 --> 01:23:04.017
Men: Welcome back,
welcome back.

01:23:04.085 --> 01:23:06.314
We've been waiting for you.
Nils Jakkelsen.

01:23:06.387 --> 01:23:07.480
Stick with me.

01:23:07.555 --> 01:23:09.251
I can do things
for you.

01:23:09.324 --> 01:23:11.452
You know what I mean?

01:23:14.029 --> 01:23:16.088
You can start
by getting my bag.

01:23:20.103 --> 01:23:22.333
Man: That's one way to do it.

01:23:22.406 --> 01:23:24.602
I'll take you
to the captain.

01:23:26.076 --> 01:23:28.045
To your left, upstairs.

01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:30.647
Here.

01:23:35.620 --> 01:23:37.212
Straight on.

01:23:39.857 --> 01:23:41.689
It's in there.

01:23:43.061 --> 01:23:44.255
You can go, Jakkelsen.

01:23:46.632 --> 01:23:47.724
You're on board

01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:49.564
because we needed
a cabin steward.

01:23:49.637 --> 01:23:51.603
Your duties include
light cleaning,

01:23:51.671 --> 01:23:54.573
and you're responsible
for the ship's laundry.

01:23:54.641 --> 01:23:56.007
You can go now.

01:23:56.075 --> 01:23:57.007
We have representatives

01:23:57.076 --> 01:23:59.705
from the shipping
company with us,

01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:01.749
living on
the upper boat deck.

01:24:01.817 --> 01:24:03.011
There's no admittance
whatsoever.

01:24:03.084 --> 01:24:04.516
If you disobey
this order,

01:24:04.585 --> 01:24:06.144
I'll have you locked up.

01:24:21.604 --> 01:24:23.094
How about a quick fuck?

01:24:25.209 --> 01:24:27.575
Women are crazy
about me.

01:24:28.111 --> 01:24:29.204
Hmm.

01:25:24.106 --> 01:25:26.042
Smilla Qaavigaq Jaspersen.

01:25:26.110 --> 01:25:28.043
That must be
a Greenlandic middle name.

01:25:28.111 --> 01:25:30.047
What's on the upper deck?

01:25:30.115 --> 01:25:31.638
Fucked if I know, man.

01:25:31.716 --> 01:25:33.649
I've never seen security
like this before.

01:25:33.717 --> 01:25:34.760
This whole outfit is weird.

01:25:34.851 --> 01:25:35.636
Even the captain says

01:25:35.719 --> 01:25:37.221
he doesn't know where we're headed.

01:25:37.287 --> 01:25:39.450
And the crew.
They're a pile of shit,

01:25:39.525 --> 01:25:41.099
and they stick together.

01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:43.465
They are scared,
and they won't tell me why.

01:25:43.537 --> 01:25:45.767
And then the passengers
on the upper deck

01:25:45.838 --> 01:25:47.272
we never get to see.

01:25:47.341 --> 01:25:49.275
Who the fuck are they?

01:25:49.343 --> 01:25:52.370
Then there's you, Smilla.

01:25:52.446 --> 01:25:54.608
Why'd Lukas let you on board?

01:25:54.682 --> 01:25:56.274
Everyone thinks you're a cop.

01:25:56.351 --> 01:25:57.876
You're spying on me?

01:25:57.953 --> 01:26:00.547
Actually, Jakkelsen,
I came for a quick fuck.

01:26:00.623 --> 01:26:02.614
But you spoiled it by talking.

01:26:04.193 --> 01:26:06.218
And you're gonna help me,

01:26:06.294 --> 01:26:07.659
you little needle freak.

01:26:16.446 --> 01:26:17.708
No way.

01:26:17.781 --> 01:26:18.712
I get claustrophobic.

01:26:18.782 --> 01:26:20.716
I'm not kidding.

01:26:20.783 --> 01:26:21.716
You're not going.

01:26:21.784 --> 01:26:22.979
I am.

01:26:23.054 --> 01:26:24.214
I get claustrophobic.

01:26:24.289 --> 01:26:26.519
Press the button
for the upper deck.

01:26:26.590 --> 01:26:30.118
If anyone tries to send you away,

01:26:30.195 --> 01:26:31.629
just refuse to leave.

01:26:31.696 --> 01:26:34.221
Give me an hour.
If I'm not back

01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:36.790
in a hour, wake up Lukas.

01:26:36.869 --> 01:26:39.303
No. I can't do that, man.

01:26:39.371 --> 01:26:41.101
Why not?

01:26:43.309 --> 01:26:46.643
He's my father.
That's why I'm on board.

01:26:46.713 --> 01:26:49.408
That's why I have the key.

01:26:49.482 --> 01:26:51.109
He thinks I'm clean.

01:26:52.452 --> 01:26:54.250
You'd do that to me, man?

01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:55.254
You'd tell him?

01:26:55.323 --> 01:26:56.415
In a second.

01:26:56.490 --> 01:26:58.582
Now send me up.

01:28:51.651 --> 01:28:53.175
Gentlemen.

01:28:53.253 --> 01:28:55.483
What we are planning to bring back

01:28:55.556 --> 01:28:58.252
from our expedition to Greenland

01:28:58.325 --> 01:28:59.759
is a scientific sensation...

01:28:59.828 --> 01:29:03.389
the most valuable discovery ever made.

01:29:03.465 --> 01:29:05.763
An energy-producing meteorite,

01:29:05.834 --> 01:29:08.100
the fragment of a planet

01:29:08.170 --> 01:29:09.830
from the beginning of creation,

01:29:09.905 --> 01:29:13.067
back from the origin of
the solar system.

01:29:15.378 --> 01:29:17.313
Not only will it multiply
our investment,

01:29:17.381 --> 01:29:20.475
but it will give our company

01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:23.543
a very dominating position
in the world.

01:29:23.621 --> 01:29:26.182
But there's a drawback.

01:29:27.893 --> 01:29:30.655
The stone brought a lethal

01:29:30.728 --> 01:29:32.629
prehistoric organism back to life.

01:29:32.698 --> 01:29:34.494
It's a kind of worm.

01:29:34.565 --> 01:29:37.295
Some of our men
were killed by this worm

01:29:37.369 --> 01:29:39.803
when they were diving
in the melt water

01:29:39.872 --> 01:29:42.306
around the meteorite
on our last expedition.

01:29:42.374 --> 01:29:44.536
The only survivor is a child,

01:29:44.611 --> 01:29:46.807
who, unfortunately,
ran into the water

01:29:46.880 --> 01:29:49.178
in an attempt
to reach his father,

01:29:49.249 --> 01:29:50.579
one of the divers.

01:29:50.650 --> 01:29:51.844
Ever since this incident,

01:29:51.919 --> 01:29:54.717
this child has been
kept under observa...

01:30:20.616 --> 01:30:22.209
Man:: Give me your hand here.

01:30:22.285 --> 01:30:26.155
This worm is always fatal,

01:30:26.224 --> 01:30:29.318
but only when it reaches
the inner organs.

01:30:29.394 --> 01:30:33.125
It seems that young people
can live with it longer,

01:30:33.198 --> 01:30:37.431
presumably because their
immune systems are stronger.

01:33:09.138 --> 01:33:11.402
They're out of champagne.

01:33:16.747 --> 01:33:18.681
What did you see up there?

01:33:18.748 --> 01:33:20.443
Enough to nail those bastards.

01:34:30.333 --> 01:34:31.732
I've got her!

01:34:31.802 --> 01:34:33.394
No!

01:34:50.690 --> 01:34:52.748
What else could I do?
I lit a cigar

01:34:52.825 --> 01:34:55.317
and put it up to the sensor.

01:34:55.395 --> 01:34:56.953
I'm really fucked now, man.

01:34:57.031 --> 01:34:58.497
They know it's me.

01:34:58.566 --> 01:34:59.497
Bunch of freaks!

01:34:59.567 --> 01:35:01.500
What the hell did you do

01:35:01.568 --> 01:35:03.695
to make them want to kill you?

01:35:03.771 --> 01:35:05.705
They want to kill both of us.

01:35:10.379 --> 01:35:12.643
This is the captain.

01:35:12.714 --> 01:35:14.648
We're approaching
the Nordic Star platform.

01:35:14.715 --> 01:35:17.310
We'll be docked
for about half an hour.

01:35:17.386 --> 01:35:19.513
All crew members are confined
to quarters.

01:35:19.587 --> 01:35:21.819
No one is to leave the ship.

01:35:21.892 --> 01:35:24.655
I repeat:
No one is to leave the ship.

01:35:24.727 --> 01:35:26.217
I've got to get off now.

01:35:26.296 --> 01:35:27.321
Don't look so panicky.

01:35:27.396 --> 01:35:29.990
Just stay close to
Jakkelsen the Great.

01:35:30.066 --> 01:35:31.728
Ever been to Hong Kong?

01:35:31.802 --> 01:35:35.134
They offered me
a modeling contract once.

01:35:35.206 --> 01:35:36.332
Let's go there.

01:35:36.407 --> 01:35:38.534
You are expressly
refused permission

01:35:38.610 --> 01:35:39.736
to leave the ship.

01:35:39.811 --> 01:35:42.575
Any crew member attempting
to do so

01:35:42.647 --> 01:35:45.582
will be arrested
and taken into custody.

01:35:47.987 --> 01:35:49.544
Won't he worry about you?

01:35:49.622 --> 01:35:51.453
I'll send him a telegram.

01:35:51.524 --> 01:35:52.650
Let's get out of here.

01:36:01.168 --> 01:36:04.137
How about a quick
fuck before we go?

01:36:10.778 --> 01:36:12.713
Once the lights go out,

01:36:12.781 --> 01:36:15.509
give me a head start,
and then follow me.

01:36:21.357 --> 01:36:22.723
Relax, man.

01:36:22.791 --> 01:36:25.762
You can make it up
to me in Hong Kong.

01:36:32.069 --> 01:36:34.366
Man: Aah!

01:37:10.745 --> 01:37:12.007
Get up!

01:37:12.079 --> 01:37:13.012
We're almost there.

01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:14.309
I don't feel well.

01:37:14.382 --> 01:37:16.714
It'll be hard to find a modeling job.

01:37:25.061 --> 01:37:27.256
Never look right at the audience.

01:37:27.330 --> 01:37:30.823
You got to look over their heads.

01:37:30.902 --> 01:37:35.634
Proud. Like you don't give a shit.

01:37:35.707 --> 01:37:37.799
Like a fucking star, man.

01:37:39.110 --> 01:37:40.873
Like a star.

01:37:40.945 --> 01:37:43.039
Yeah, Jakkelsen.

01:37:43.114 --> 01:37:44.240
Like a star.

01:38:16.752 --> 01:38:18.549
Oil rigging will commence

01:38:18.621 --> 01:38:19.951
in 45 minutes.

01:38:20.023 --> 01:38:23.480
Please be sure to secure
all your safety clothing

01:38:23.559 --> 01:38:26.084
as recommended by
the Ansi safety standards.

01:38:26.163 --> 01:38:28.723
Oil rigging will commence
in 45 minutes.

01:38:28.798 --> 01:38:30.824
Please be sure to secure
all your safety clothing

01:38:30.901 --> 01:38:33.096
as recommended
by the Ansi safety standards.

01:39:48.488 --> 01:39:50.045
What are they paying you?

01:39:50.123 --> 01:39:51.987
Is it enough?

01:39:52.058 --> 01:39:55.516
The g-government
never pays well enough.

01:39:55.595 --> 01:39:57.580
Listen to me!

01:39:57.698 --> 01:39:58.755
Listen to me!

01:39:58.832 --> 01:40:00.265
The government knew

01:40:00.333 --> 01:40:02.268
that there was
something big going on.

01:40:02.335 --> 01:40:04.361
They didn't know
what it was exactly,

01:40:04.439 --> 01:40:06.669
but they knew they
were going again.

01:40:06.741 --> 01:40:09.232
They hired me
because I was a diver,

01:40:09.309 --> 01:40:12.541
because I was the kind of person
that Tork needed.

01:40:12.614 --> 01:40:14.514
I met him, he trusted me.

01:40:14.582 --> 01:40:16.279
He arranged for me to
move into the building

01:40:16.352 --> 01:40:17.978
to keep an eye on the boy.

01:40:18.052 --> 01:40:19.883
I didn't even know that he was sick.

01:40:19.955 --> 01:40:21.422
You never loved him!

01:40:21.490 --> 01:40:23.048
Of course I loved him!

01:40:23.124 --> 01:40:24.592
I just wanted to protect him,

01:40:24.660 --> 01:40:28.152
and for a while,
I thought that I could.

01:40:28.230 --> 01:40:29.289
Listen to me.

01:40:29.367 --> 01:40:30.765
Listen.

01:40:30.833 --> 01:40:34.668
There's not a night
that goes by...

01:40:35.874 --> 01:40:39.468
that I don't dream
that I catch him.

01:40:41.813 --> 01:40:43.905
I catch him in my arms...

01:40:45.517 --> 01:40:48.885
...before he hits the ground.

01:41:07.741 --> 01:41:10.539
We can start over.

01:41:25.394 --> 01:41:26.953
Tork and Loyen are desperate.

01:41:27.029 --> 01:41:28.291
They're under extreme pressure.

01:41:28.364 --> 01:41:29.626
They'll show no mercy.

01:41:29.700 --> 01:41:31.633
You can hide in my cabin,

01:41:31.702 --> 01:41:33.136
but only for a little while.

01:41:33.203 --> 01:41:35.137
The ship is approaching the coast.

01:41:35.205 --> 01:41:36.828
You've to get ashore.

01:41:55.616 --> 01:41:58.551
Just go inland. Wait for me.

01:41:58.619 --> 01:42:00.746
There's a village just inside the bay

01:42:00.820 --> 01:42:02.813
about 7 miles to the south.

01:45:58.819 --> 01:46:02.812
You see how it's drawing energy

01:46:02.890 --> 01:46:05.688
from some sort of vacuum in the center?

01:46:33.356 --> 01:46:36.292
I knew you'd come.

01:46:36.361 --> 01:46:37.726
For people with resources,

01:46:37.795 --> 01:46:39.854
the right events happen.

01:46:39.932 --> 01:46:41.559
They may look like coincidences,

01:46:41.633 --> 01:46:44.500
but they arise out of necessity.

01:46:44.570 --> 01:46:45.901
Incredible, isn't it?

01:46:45.971 --> 01:46:47.438
We can see inside it.

01:46:47.506 --> 01:46:48.734
It's not a real meteorite.

01:46:48.807 --> 01:46:51.173
Meteorites are cold. This is warm.

01:46:51.243 --> 01:46:55.704
Meteorites are dead.
This... is alive.

01:46:55.783 --> 01:46:59.240
And why are you doing all this, Tork?

01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:01.413
Why, money.

01:47:01.488 --> 01:47:04.013
Fame. More money.

01:47:04.090 --> 01:47:07.424
This is the biggest scientific discovery

01:47:07.496 --> 01:47:09.156
of the century.

01:47:09.230 --> 01:47:10.663
You can't remove it and transport it

01:47:10.732 --> 01:47:12.792
to a densely populated
part of the world.

01:47:12.868 --> 01:47:15.201
Not until you know
exactly what it is.

01:47:15.270 --> 01:47:17.934
You could set off a catastrophe.

01:47:18.007 --> 01:47:19.531
Oh, death is always a waste,

01:47:19.608 --> 01:47:21.941
but sometimes it is the only way

01:47:22.012 --> 01:47:23.444
to arouse people.

01:47:23.513 --> 01:47:25.447
Bohr participated in the construction

01:47:25.515 --> 01:47:26.949
of the atom bomb

01:47:27.017 --> 01:47:28.451
and thought it would promote peace.

01:47:28.519 --> 01:47:30.453
You lack imagination, Smilla,

01:47:30.521 --> 01:47:33.957
which is unforgivable in a scientist.

01:47:34.024 --> 01:47:35.889
What about the boy?

01:47:46.971 --> 01:47:50.931
He jumped into the damn water.

01:47:51.010 --> 01:47:54.538
We were forced to take him
along into the cave.

01:47:54.615 --> 01:47:56.046
His father collapsed

01:47:56.116 --> 01:47:58.108
while he was still near the surface.

01:47:58.186 --> 01:48:00.416
The boy wanted to go to him.

01:48:00.487 --> 01:48:05.425
It was Loyen's idea
to keep him under observation.

01:48:05.493 --> 01:48:08.725
The worm was not
in his internal organs.

01:48:08.797 --> 01:48:10.423
He never even felt it.

01:48:36.962 --> 01:48:38.725
Aaarrrgh!

01:48:45.371 --> 01:48:47.396
He killed my son.

01:49:58.837 --> 01:50:00.362
Tork!

01:51:16.425 --> 01:51:17.448
Tork!

01:51:39.816 --> 01:51:42.376
The boy, Tork.

01:51:42.453 --> 01:51:44.944
Tell me about the day he died.

01:51:50.027 --> 01:51:52.461
You were waiting outside his school,

01:51:52.531 --> 01:51:53.964
weren't you, Tork?

01:51:54.032 --> 01:51:56.466
He's the only child
who walks home alone.

01:52:03.176 --> 01:52:05.838
Smilla: You follow him.

01:52:05.912 --> 01:52:09.643
You grab him,

01:52:09.717 --> 01:52:12.948
not by his arms,
but by his clothes

01:52:13.021 --> 01:52:15.989
so you don't leave any marks.

01:52:18.058 --> 01:52:20.186
But you miscalculate.

01:52:27.570 --> 01:52:29.936
He knows you, Tork,

01:52:30.005 --> 01:52:31.438
Not from the hospital

01:52:31.507 --> 01:52:33.998
where you spent hours
tormenting him,

01:52:34.076 --> 01:52:37.240
but from the day
he saw his father die.

01:52:37.313 --> 01:52:39.942
It's death itself
he associates with you.

01:52:40.017 --> 01:52:41.245
You're guessing.

01:52:45.522 --> 01:52:47.353
He gets to his building

01:52:47.425 --> 01:52:49.450
and then there's no escape.

01:52:51.530 --> 01:52:54.896
He knows what's behind him.

01:52:54.966 --> 01:52:57.765
He knows he's going to die.

01:52:57.837 --> 01:53:02.205
This fear is even stronger
than his fear of heights.

01:53:02.275 --> 01:53:04.140
Inside him an engine is spinning

01:53:04.210 --> 01:53:05.838
that will keep turning

01:53:05.911 --> 01:53:08.278
until all his strength is used up.

01:53:11.551 --> 01:53:14.487
And you chase him up to the roof.

01:53:14.555 --> 01:53:17.490
Maybe for the first time
it occurs to you

01:53:17.559 --> 01:53:19.492
not just to get the tape...

01:53:19.560 --> 01:53:22.996
but that it's possible to eliminate him.

01:53:28.070 --> 01:53:30.539
And avoid him ever telling anyone

01:53:30.605 --> 01:53:32.505
what he saw in a cave
on a glacier somewhere

01:53:32.575 --> 01:53:33.769
in the Davis Strait.

01:53:37.312 --> 01:53:38.974
I didn't mean to kill him.

01:53:39.048 --> 01:53:41.380
I needed the tape.

01:53:41.452 --> 01:53:43.648
He panicked, I shouted,

01:53:43.720 --> 01:53:46.053
he turned around, he didn't see me.

01:53:46.123 --> 01:53:48.456
You're lying.

01:53:52.030 --> 01:53:53.861
He didn't turn around.

01:53:57.034 --> 01:53:59.630
He couldn't hear a thing.

01:54:02.541 --> 01:54:04.806
He was deaf.

01:54:05.305 --> 01:54:11.458
