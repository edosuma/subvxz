You don't talk
about him very much.

01:15.045 --> 01:16.011
Were you guys close?

01:16.013 --> 01:17.462
Oh, yeah, we were,
we were inseparable.

01:17.464 --> 01:19.631
I mean, why do you think
we lived together for so long?

01:19.633 --> 01:22.184
Well, Berta says it's 'cause
you're a parasitic leech.

01:22.186 --> 01:25.520

A little.

02:40.567 --> 02:42.768
No, I-I can't tell you
how many hours

02:42.770 --> 02:45.822
I watched my brother
playing this piano

02:45.824 --> 02:48.257
or passed out under it.

02:49.493 --> 02:53.496
One time I walked in and he was
having sex on top of it.

02:53.498 --> 02:55.498
You can see
where the young lady's ass print

02:55.500 --> 02:58.751
didn't quite wax out.

02:58.753 --> 03:00.953
Maybe he should have
used a coaster.

03:06.878 --> 03:10.379
New business idea--
ass coasters.

03:11.882 --> 03:13.883
We're here to pick up a piano.

03:13.885 --> 03:17.770
Oh, right, I, I forgot.

03:17.772 --> 03:19.038
Uh...

03:20.491 --> 03:22.275
Hold on.

03:28.198 --> 03:32.235
So I imagine you're anxious

03:32.237 --> 03:33.870
to get rid of some of these

03:33.872 --> 03:34.904
painful memories.

03:34.906 --> 03:36.272
No, are you kidding me?

03:36.274 --> 03:37.957
I mean, this piano
is practically

03:37.959 --> 03:39.659
all I have left of my brother,

03:39.661 --> 03:42.128
except for, you
know, all the DNA

03:42.130 --> 03:44.714
he left on the
couch and...

03:44.716 --> 03:48.000
on the floor and...

03:48.002 --> 03:50.452
on the walls and
on the stairs,

03:50.454 --> 03:55.291
but I'm not going to clone him,
so the piano's pretty much it.

03:55.293 --> 03:59.178
Okay, we got a problem then.
How so?

03:59.180 --> 04:01.731
Well, you know
how I'm redecorating the house?

04:01.733 --> 04:05.434
I donated the piano to a music
school for underprivileged kids.

04:05.436 --> 04:06.435
What?

04:06.437 --> 04:08.470
How could you be so selfish?

04:08.472 --> 04:11.090
I'm sorry,
I'll just tell the kids

04:11.092 --> 04:14.610
they have to keep practicing
on a painted slab of wood.

04:14.612 --> 04:16.362
No, no, you're right.

04:16.363 --> 04:17.863
This, this should
go to someone

04:17.865 --> 04:19.665
who will benefit
from it.

04:19.666 --> 04:20.866
You sure?

04:20.868 --> 04:24.320
Yeah, yeah, let me,
uh, let me just get

04:24.322 --> 04:26.172
Charlie's personal stuff
out of here.

04:26.174 --> 04:30.626
Oh, oh, here's some of
his unfinished music.

04:30.628 --> 04:33.512
Uh, panties.

04:33.514 --> 04:37.850
Panties... panties.

04:37.852 --> 04:40.052
Water pipe.

04:41.471 --> 04:42.671
Oh, vibrator.

04:42.673 --> 04:43.689
Oh.

04:45.343 --> 04:47.143
So we're talking songs,

04:47.145 --> 04:50.529
thongs, bongs,
and schlongs.

04:50.531 --> 04:54.150
If he had an autobiography,
that would be the title.

04:55.702 --> 04:57.203
You know, there was a time

04:57.205 --> 04:59.205
when I would have found
these things disgusting.

04:59.207 --> 05:00.222
And now?

05:00.224 --> 05:02.041
There's a certain wistfulness

05:02.043 --> 05:04.026
mixed in with my revulsion.

05:04.996 --> 05:06.712
Ready to go here?

05:06.714 --> 05:08.297
Uh, yeah, come on in.

It's over here.

05:10.251 --> 05:13.552
Thanks, we would've had
trouble finding it.

05:13.554 --> 05:15.988
I changed my mind!

Now, come on,
talk to me.

06:53.637 --> 06:57.440
I don't know, Uncle Charlie
just never treated me

06:57.442 --> 06:59.442
like I was some stupid kid.

06:59.444 --> 07:01.327
That's nice.

07:01.329 --> 07:05.030
He treated me
more like a stupid person.

07:05.866 --> 07:09.251
Well, I know he loved you.

07:09.253 --> 07:11.253
Then how come
he didn't leave me anything?

07:11.255 --> 07:13.756
Well, you don't measure love
by things.

07:13.758 --> 07:15.374
I disagree.

07:16.593 --> 07:19.845
Nothing says "I love you"
like a Mercedes CL600.

07:19.847 --> 07:21.797
Hey, the Mercedes
was leased.

07:21.799 --> 07:24.683
And is that all your uncle
meant to you-- a nice car?

07:24.685 --> 07:26.585
Of course not--
I learned a lot from him.

07:26.587 --> 07:27.953
Like what?

07:27.955 --> 07:29.221
Well, let's see.

07:29.223 --> 07:31.557
If it doesn't fit,
don't force it.

07:36.196 --> 07:38.564
It's always better
to say sorry afterwards

07:38.566 --> 07:40.733
than ask for permission before.

07:42.352 --> 07:44.203
And if it's burning,
bleeding, or oozing,

07:44.205 --> 07:46.372
go to see a doctor ASAP.

07:49.209 --> 07:51.744
Oh, God.

07:51.746 --> 07:53.579
But probably the most
important thing I learned

07:53.581 --> 07:55.164
is that by the time I'm his age,

07:55.166 --> 07:57.416
I want to be married
and have a family.

07:57.418 --> 07:58.867
Really?

07:58.869 --> 08:01.971
Yeah, Uncle Charlie
was very lonely, Dad.

08:01.973 --> 08:05.307
Yeah, yeah, he was.

08:05.309 --> 08:07.460
And I don't want to be like him.

08:07.462 --> 08:10.312
Well, good for you.

08:10.314 --> 08:13.432

to be like you either.
