WEBVTT

00:12.554 --> 00:13.638
[sighs]

00:15.932 --> 00:16.933
Hmm.

00:18.435 --> 00:19.728
Ah…

00:20.270 --> 00:21.104
Who did that?

00:21.187 --> 00:22.564
[grunting]

00:26.026 --> 00:26.901
I did.

00:29.904 --> 00:31.448
[laughs]

00:32.073 --> 00:33.658
Somebody's screwing with ya.

00:34.159 --> 00:36.286
Check that thing's ass
for a "made in China."

00:36.369 --> 00:39.622
-No way that's me. Cheap knockoff.
-How do you know?

00:39.706 --> 00:42.167
'Cause I would've swallowed
your baby boy whole

00:42.250 --> 00:43.626
and shit him out in pieces.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.336
Let's take those shackles off
and find out.

00:45.420 --> 00:46.421
Brandon.

00:48.840 --> 00:51.051
[echoing]
He's not even close to being ready.

00:51.801 --> 00:53.678
Maybe he never will be.

00:54.929 --> 00:57.849
Shouldn't he be locked up for what he did
to whatever the hell this is?

00:57.932 --> 00:59.392
Put him back in Supermax.

00:59.476 --> 01:02.520
Oh, I see how it is. Rules don't apply
when it's your kid doing the killing?

01:02.604 --> 01:03.730
Get him out of here.

01:03.813 --> 01:05.940
Double standards
don't look good on you, pal!

01:06.024 --> 01:07.567
That's some screwed-up shit!

01:07.650 --> 01:11.279
You think people ain't gonna notice?
I got a fan club, asshole!

01:11.362 --> 01:12.280
[laughs]

01:12.363 --> 01:15.492
Jesus Christ,
that guy's got a mouth on him.

01:15.950 --> 01:17.368
He always has.

01:17.994 --> 01:19.245
This one never said a word.

01:21.206 --> 01:22.290
No, he didn't.

01:29.047 --> 01:29.964
What do you think?

01:30.673 --> 01:34.344
Clone? Parallel dimension?
Some kind of a shapeshifter?

01:36.805 --> 01:38.264
Whatever it is, we need answers.

01:38.848 --> 01:40.934
Gonna need to cut him open to get them.

01:46.189 --> 01:48.441
[dramatic music playing]

02:31.568 --> 02:33.153
[crowd clamoring]

02:33.236 --> 02:34.404
[whistling]

02:34.487 --> 02:37.323
[reporter 1] If Blackstar didn't escape,
who did you fight in Nebraska?

02:37.407 --> 02:38.908
We're investigating the situation.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.243
-[reporter 2] Lady Liberty!
-Yes.

02:40.326 --> 02:42.829
What steps are being taken
to secure the Supermax?

02:42.912 --> 02:44.873
There is no indication
of a security breach.

02:44.956 --> 02:47.083
Wherever
the second Blackstar originated from,

02:47.167 --> 02:48.710
it was not the Supermax.

02:48.793 --> 02:50.503
-Yes?
-[reporter 3] There's been reports

02:50.587 --> 02:53.256
of massive reprisals
from several supervillain groups.

02:53.339 --> 02:54.924
Is this something your team is aware of?

02:55.008 --> 02:57.302
We're in contact
with state and federal authorities.

02:57.385 --> 02:59.429
If we find any indication
of an ongoing threat--

02:59.512 --> 03:00.513
Where's Paragon?

03:00.597 --> 03:03.016
Paragon is in the process
of an after-action debrief.

03:03.099 --> 03:04.809
[reporter 4] Does he have a statement?

03:05.727 --> 03:06.811
[Grace] Yes.

03:06.895 --> 03:08.855
Paragon wishes to express his regret

03:08.938 --> 03:10.940
that the life
of a hostile combatant was lost,

03:11.024 --> 03:12.317
regardless of the circumstances.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.278
The latest option poll
suggests 78% of Americans

03:15.361 --> 03:17.572
support your son's execution
of a supervillain.

03:17.655 --> 03:20.533
Do you think your old-fashioned ideas
of just tossing them in prison

03:20.658 --> 03:23.077
-is becoming a threat to public safety?
-The Union thinks--

03:23.161 --> 03:26.539
If that's true,
78% of my fellow Americans need to think

03:26.623 --> 03:28.833
about what kind of a country
they wanna live in.

03:28.917 --> 03:32.462
Lethal force
without due process is not justice.

03:32.545 --> 03:35.423
[man] But how are you gonna protect us
from supervillains?

03:35.506 --> 03:36.758
[crowd booing]

03:47.977 --> 03:48.978
[whizzing]

03:54.025 --> 03:56.361
Your grandpa saw that,
he'd set off fireworks.

03:56.444 --> 03:57.362
[chuckles]

04:00.490 --> 04:03.534
Brandon, I know
it hasn't been easy being my son.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.372
Growing up
with the public constantly watching you,

04:07.455 --> 04:09.207
looking up at you
and wanting to tear you down

04:09.290 --> 04:10.458
all in the same breath.

04:12.377 --> 04:15.797
Brandon, what you did to Blackstar
you can't take back.

04:16.589 --> 04:17.423
Blackstar?

04:19.050 --> 04:21.886
Everything you do
is a reflection on this family.

04:23.012 --> 04:25.932
We have to be the ideal.
You have to be the ideal.

04:26.015 --> 04:27.225
[scoffs]

04:27.809 --> 04:30.395
Chloe didn't even show up
when Blackstar was tearing up Nebraska.

04:30.478 --> 04:31.562
I'm not talking about Chloe.

04:31.646 --> 04:33.022
She's drunk or high half the time,

04:33.106 --> 04:35.066
and I'm the one
not living up to your expectations?

04:35.149 --> 04:37.777
-Don't talk about your sister like that.
-Like what?

04:38.820 --> 04:41.364
Like the way she talks
about everyone else in this family?

04:41.447 --> 04:42.907
-Yes.
-[metal can dings]

04:42.991 --> 04:46.077
Stop lowering yourself every time
somebody pisses you off. Be better.

04:47.245 --> 04:48.705
My friends were dead.

04:50.164 --> 04:52.458
I had to make a choice
between Blackstar and you.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.210
[grunting]

04:54.294 --> 04:55.169
Dad!

04:55.753 --> 04:57.130
I chose you, Dad.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.550
And I'd choose you every time.

05:03.094 --> 05:04.345
Wouldn't you do the same?

05:07.056 --> 05:09.309
You're gonna be here long after I'm gone.

05:11.144 --> 05:14.272
And one day, God willing,
you're gonna be the Utopian…

05:16.316 --> 05:18.818
and every evil you can imagine
is gonna rise up against you,

05:18.901 --> 05:20.403
against mankind,

05:21.321 --> 05:24.157
and not for justice, for vengeance.

05:24.782 --> 05:25.825
And in those moments,

05:25.908 --> 05:30.955
the only thing that you will have
to guide you is the Code.

05:31.039 --> 05:34.250
It has to stand, Brandon, even if we fall.

05:39.714 --> 05:43.343
So, what? I should've just let
Blackstar slaughter us?

05:43.426 --> 05:44.927
Killing is never the answer.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.764
Why don't you tell that
to my friends we're burying?

05:48.389 --> 05:50.141
[rock whizzes]

05:55.855 --> 05:58.358
There's always another way
to get the job done, Brandon. Always.

05:58.441 --> 06:00.193
Except I can't shoot fire
from my eyes, Dad.

06:00.276 --> 06:01.611
Not yet, you can't.

06:01.694 --> 06:02.820
[scoffs]

06:03.404 --> 06:06.115
Look, if what I say or do, it hurts you,
I'm sorry.

06:08.659 --> 06:11.287
But one day, you're gonna be stronger
than anyone else in the world,

06:12.163 --> 06:13.164
including me.

06:17.710 --> 06:18.836
All right, Brandon.

06:20.546 --> 06:22.840
Stay out here on the farm
until things quiet down.

06:22.924 --> 06:24.842
-Clear your head.
-You're grounding me?

06:24.926 --> 06:26.177
I'm not grounding you, Brandon.

06:26.260 --> 06:28.179
No, Dad. This is bullshit.

06:28.262 --> 06:31.432
Have you seen
what the supervillains are doing?

06:31.516 --> 06:33.601
Work the farm, stay out of sight.

06:33.684 --> 06:35.812
No uniform, no patrol
until I give the okay.

06:35.895 --> 06:36.979
Do you understand?

06:38.481 --> 06:41.567
-Do you understand?
-Yes, sir.

06:43.277 --> 06:44.278
[rock thudding]

06:44.904 --> 06:48.449
It's not a punishment, Brandon.
It's an opportunity. Use it.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.042
[steam whistle blowing]

07:01.254 --> 07:02.547
We're up to our necks,

07:02.630 --> 07:04.924
and you stop by the cleaners
before coming in?

07:06.300 --> 07:08.636
It's Dad's suit, for the funeral.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.515
It's a closed casket, for Christ's sake.
No one's gonna know.

07:12.598 --> 07:14.350
Yeah, well, I'll know.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.519
[indistinct chattering outside]

07:19.188 --> 07:21.732
All right, let's see
how we're wrapping Pop

07:21.816 --> 07:23.818
for the big send-off.

07:31.033 --> 07:32.160
The Kuppenheimer.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.457
-He'll look good in that.
-Yeah.

07:39.208 --> 07:41.127
But let's change the tie.

07:43.254 --> 07:44.630
No, he loved that tie.

07:44.714 --> 07:47.133
[chuckles] He hated it.

07:47.216 --> 07:48.885
He wore that tie all the time.

07:48.968 --> 07:50.970
Yeah, 'cause you gave it to him.

07:58.478 --> 08:01.063
That's his huckleberry, right there.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.231
[sniffles]

08:02.899 --> 08:05.359
Went on the second your ass hit the door.
[chuckles]

08:06.110 --> 08:08.112
He told me this was his favorite tie.

08:08.738 --> 08:10.656
Yeah, he said a lot of things, Shel.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.289
[sniffles]

08:26.172 --> 08:27.089
Uh…

08:29.300 --> 08:30.676
I spoke with the board.

08:32.637 --> 08:34.096
They wanna shut it all down.

08:34.931 --> 08:37.141
What? They can't do that.

08:37.225 --> 08:38.184
Yeah, they can.

08:39.227 --> 08:42.438
-We have to talk to them.
-[sighs] I've been talking to them, Shel.

08:42.522 --> 08:43.606
Dad would never put our men…

08:43.689 --> 08:44.941
-He's dead.
-I don't care.

08:45.024 --> 08:47.193
-We are not putting our guys…
-[knocking on door]

08:47.276 --> 08:48.778
-[overlapping arguing]
-[door opens]

08:48.861 --> 08:51.030
-[Sheldon] What?
-[Willie] Excuse us! Please.

08:51.113 --> 08:53.282
-Can we have a minute?
-Not a good time, Willie.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.326
We've got something
we think you ought to see.

08:56.494 --> 08:57.328
What is it?

09:01.999 --> 09:02.833
Shel?

09:03.543 --> 09:06.128
[Sheldon]
They're saying Dad ripped off the workers.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.421
Son of a bitch.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.590
Where's G. Kennedy?

09:10.341 --> 09:11.217
Where is he?

09:11.884 --> 09:14.845
I wanna talk to the scumbag
who wrote this garbage!

09:14.929 --> 09:17.431
I'm the scumbag you're looking for, pal.

09:17.515 --> 09:18.558
You're G. Kennedy?

09:18.641 --> 09:19.809
I stutter? Who are you?

09:19.892 --> 09:21.686
Lawyer, I'm guessing, by the suit.

09:21.769 --> 09:25.106
"Chester Sampson
gambled his workers' pensions on expansion

09:25.189 --> 09:28.568
and lost it all in the market crash."
How can you make up lies like this?

09:29.527 --> 09:32.029
There's not a word in there
that isn't the God's honest.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.781
Everything is double-sourced,

09:33.864 --> 09:35.408
-top to bottom.
-Top to bottom.

09:35.491 --> 09:38.035
[Grace] So you can run back
to whoever's trying to rattle me

09:38.119 --> 09:39.495
at Sampson Steel,

09:39.579 --> 09:44.041
and you can tell them that Grace Kennedy,
she doesn't get rattled, ever.

09:44.709 --> 09:47.753
My father would never do
any of the things that you say here.

09:47.837 --> 09:48.921
Oh, shit.

09:49.630 --> 09:50.881
I'm sorry for your loss.

09:50.965 --> 09:55.052
Oh, you're sorry for my loss?
I guess my loss is your gain, right?

09:56.387 --> 09:59.557
"The death of capitalism."
That is one hell of a headline.

09:59.640 --> 10:02.810
Well, guess what,
you rotten little Marxists?

10:02.893 --> 10:05.062
Capitalism made this building!

10:06.230 --> 10:08.482
It made your homes, and it made your cars!

10:08.566 --> 10:10.443
And my father made the steel

10:10.526 --> 10:14.322
that built everything that makes
this country the greatest in the world!

10:14.405 --> 10:17.658
And what do you do, huh? What do you make?
What do you… what do you contribute?

10:17.742 --> 10:20.536
You lurk behind your ink
and your newsprint,

10:20.620 --> 10:21.787
wagging your little finger

10:21.871 --> 10:23.831
while you drag a good man's name
through the muck!

10:23.914 --> 10:25.708
And he was a good man!

10:26.834 --> 10:30.921
What have you built, huh?
How are you helping America?

10:31.005 --> 10:32.590
Your nose is bleeding.

10:37.219 --> 10:40.222
You should be ashamed of yourself,
all of you.

10:41.265 --> 10:42.266
[grunts]

10:55.071 --> 10:56.197
Thought you went home.

10:58.949 --> 10:59.909
You all right?

11:01.118 --> 11:02.036
[Petra] Yeah.

11:03.079 --> 11:06.624
Did you ever lose anybody
back when you were a superhero?

11:10.169 --> 11:11.003
No.

11:15.049 --> 11:17.385
[sighs deeply]

11:18.552 --> 11:19.512
Were you afraid?

11:19.595 --> 11:20.721
-[grunts]
-[screams]

11:21.555 --> 11:22.390
Yeah.

11:24.350 --> 11:25.309
[Fitz] Did you run?

11:25.851 --> 11:27.395
No, of course not.

11:27.478 --> 11:29.271
[shouting]

11:29.355 --> 11:30.773
So you stayed, and you fought?

11:30.856 --> 11:32.650
Yeah, I got a couple of hits in, but--

11:32.733 --> 11:34.819
I'm not talking about fighting Blackstar.

11:34.902 --> 11:36.445
I'm talking
about fighting through the fear.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.572
-It wasn't enough.
-[Fitz] It never is.

11:39.198 --> 11:41.158
-Petra, I know you don't--
-I'm not you.

11:41.784 --> 11:44.203
I can't keep taking hits
and just get back up.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.997
I can't watch my friends die
because of some asshole.

11:47.415 --> 11:48.624
[grunts]

11:49.583 --> 11:52.253
[Petra] The supervillains
are going crazy out there.

11:52.336 --> 11:54.964
Guys who robbed banks before
have been killing people.

11:55.798 --> 11:56.882
[sighs]

11:56.966 --> 11:58.300
[voice breaking] I can't.

11:59.343 --> 12:00.386
[sighs]

12:00.469 --> 12:02.346
[Petra]
What if this is just the start of it?

12:02.847 --> 12:06.225
I don't know if I can do this
when things are this insane.

12:06.892 --> 12:07.893
Then don't.

12:13.482 --> 12:16.152
I never asked you
to follow me into this game.

12:19.572 --> 12:22.158
Hell, I'm surprised you wanted to,

12:22.241 --> 12:25.536
after all the foolish shit
I got up to when you were little.

12:27.788 --> 12:29.415
I was worried you weren't ready,

12:30.332 --> 12:32.042
that you'd get yourself hurt…

12:33.794 --> 12:34.795
bad, like I did.

12:38.174 --> 12:41.343
[sighs] But here you are,
and I couldn't be prouder.

12:42.011 --> 12:43.721
[scoffs, chuckles]

12:43.804 --> 12:44.972
For not getting killed?

12:45.055 --> 12:46.432
[chuckles softly]

12:48.768 --> 12:52.313
For being better than me… in so many ways.

13:05.493 --> 13:06.494
[knocking on door]

13:10.456 --> 13:12.333
[door unlocks, opens]

13:13.375 --> 13:14.335
[gasps softly]

13:21.008 --> 13:21.926
Are you okay?

13:22.468 --> 13:23.844
Yeah, I'm fine.

13:28.682 --> 13:31.060
I got bagels
from that place you like in New York.

13:32.770 --> 13:34.522
I can't have gluten.
I have a shoot coming up.

13:39.276 --> 13:40.361
Can I use your toaster?

13:41.779 --> 13:42.613
[sighs]

13:43.531 --> 13:44.448
[yawns]

13:52.665 --> 13:53.499
[Sheldon] Thank you.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.964
You don't eat them,
I'll just throw them at the gulls.

14:00.047 --> 14:01.590
Keep me awake half the night.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.718
I thought gulls slept
when the sun went down.

14:05.761 --> 14:07.555
My night, their day.

14:10.057 --> 14:11.016
Oh.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.185
So, what kind of shoot is this one?

14:15.312 --> 14:18.524
Long, conservative dresses
with wholesome scenery?

14:21.694 --> 14:23.153
It's a joke, Chloe.

14:24.488 --> 14:25.489
Why are you here?

14:26.782 --> 14:27.783
[sighs]

14:34.915 --> 14:36.458
Are you coming to the funeral?

14:38.502 --> 14:41.005
-You want me there?
-Of course I want you there.

14:41.672 --> 14:44.925
Brandon could use your support.
He's really struggling right now.

14:45.509 --> 14:47.636
[sighs, scoffs]

14:47.720 --> 14:49.805
Well, what am I gonna say to him?

14:49.889 --> 14:54.184
I don't know, but he'll listen to you
before he'll listen to me or your mom.

14:56.186 --> 14:59.815
I tried talking to him about what happened
with Blackstar, but I just…

15:00.608 --> 15:02.443
[sighs] I don't know. I… I…

15:04.820 --> 15:08.198
You try to say the right thing,
the thing you think he needs to hear,

15:08.282 --> 15:09.325
but it just all…

15:13.370 --> 15:14.997
I just… I can't get through to him.

15:15.831 --> 15:17.875
Just give him some time.

15:19.418 --> 15:25.174
You know, he was tight with Barry
since… junior high.

15:28.302 --> 15:29.178
Barry Bishop.

15:30.512 --> 15:34.016
Brandon's the godfather
to his little girls.

15:34.099 --> 15:34.975
Oh.

15:35.059 --> 15:36.518
Oh yeah… Oh, Tectonic.

15:38.354 --> 15:39.355
[scoffs]

15:41.774 --> 15:43.692
There you have it, Dad.

15:45.235 --> 15:46.070
That…

15:47.655 --> 15:50.950
That is why I'm here,
halfway across the country.

15:51.033 --> 15:53.077
That is why Brandon's a mess.

15:53.160 --> 15:56.246
Because you could never stop being
the Utopian long enough

15:56.330 --> 15:58.874
to really be there for either of us.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.835
-That's just not fair, Chloe.
-[Chloe] You wanna talk about what's fair?

16:01.919 --> 16:05.965
The suit and cape are the real you, Dad…

16:09.009 --> 16:09.885
not this.

16:10.678 --> 16:12.346
Honey, I didn't come here
to fight with you.

16:12.429 --> 16:14.390
[Chloe] I know you didn't, okay?

16:14.473 --> 16:16.016
But you can't stop.

16:16.517 --> 16:18.811
If it's not how I look,

16:18.894 --> 16:21.480
it's how I dress, or who I'm dating,

16:21.563 --> 16:23.357
or how I'm reflecting on you

16:23.440 --> 16:25.734
if I don't show up
to a fight or a funeral,

16:25.818 --> 16:28.362
or any other thing that's me, Dad.

16:30.322 --> 16:33.951
You have been attacking me for so long,

16:34.493 --> 16:37.538
I don't know
how to do anything but fight you.

16:42.584 --> 16:44.586
[exhales, sniffles]

16:45.379 --> 16:47.297
Chloe, we're bigger than this, both of us.

16:47.381 --> 16:48.674
[Chloe] We're just us.

16:49.258 --> 16:51.885
The only way out of the loop is

16:53.554 --> 16:57.808
for me to stop being me,
or you to stop being you.

17:01.895 --> 17:04.648
Wait, that's just a, a lose-lose.

17:05.899 --> 17:08.444
That's a great framing device
for unaccountability.

17:11.321 --> 17:14.616
Chloe, we are our own worst enemies,
both of us.

17:15.242 --> 17:17.161
But every time
I try to propose a solution,

17:17.244 --> 17:19.580
it becomes, by default,
just another attack.

17:20.372 --> 17:22.541
I'm not trying to attack you, Chloe.

17:23.417 --> 17:26.754
If you would just stop pointing fingers
for once and start--

17:29.048 --> 17:30.090
[sighs]

17:33.510 --> 17:34.428
Yeah.

17:37.473 --> 17:38.640
[splutters, sighs]

17:51.570 --> 17:55.532
I don't know. Okay.

17:57.409 --> 17:59.286
Are you gonna make it to the funeral?

18:01.955 --> 18:03.791
It would mean a lot to me.

18:05.334 --> 18:06.251
I don't know.

18:09.463 --> 18:13.050
Well, bagels will keep in the freezer
for after the shoot.

18:20.641 --> 18:21.558
[sighs]

18:29.191 --> 18:30.234
[Walter sighs]

18:31.318 --> 18:32.319
[sighs]

18:45.874 --> 18:48.293
[sighs, mutters]

18:52.631 --> 18:54.800
What's the name of that guy from Legal?
Bieder-something?

18:54.883 --> 18:57.177
-Biederbeck.
-[Sheldon] Biederbeck, that's it.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.012
-[phone dialing]
-What are you doing?

18:59.096 --> 19:01.181
We are gonna sue Grace Kennedy
and her socialist rag

19:01.265 --> 19:02.349
into the goddamn ground.

19:02.432 --> 19:04.226
Put the phone down.
We're not suing anyone.

19:04.309 --> 19:06.687
We are not letting
these people spread lies about Dad.

19:06.770 --> 19:07.688
It's true!

19:10.816 --> 19:11.984
Everything they wrote.

19:16.738 --> 19:17.656
[phone hangs up]

19:18.157 --> 19:22.703
I checked the numbers
and confirmed it with the bank.

19:24.413 --> 19:25.414
[scoffs]

19:25.497 --> 19:28.333
He used the pension fund
to back the expansion.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.002
[sighs] Oh my God!

19:30.085 --> 19:32.421
[Walter] It's gone, all of it.

19:34.298 --> 19:35.174
Check it again.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.550
-Shel--
-[Sheldon] Check it again.

19:36.633 --> 19:40.554
You made a mistake, or the bank did.
Dad would never do something like that.

19:41.054 --> 19:43.265
You've got no goddamn idea, do you?

19:45.726 --> 19:48.437
Walking around
in a cloud of Dad's bullshit

19:48.520 --> 19:50.606
about building homes and families.

19:50.689 --> 19:51.690
[book thuds]

19:54.484 --> 19:55.527
This is steel.

19:57.196 --> 20:01.158
What we have, we clawed
from Carnegie and Rockefeller.

20:02.868 --> 20:05.996
You think that happens
without getting your hands dirty?

20:08.373 --> 20:12.586
Republic, and Bethlehem, and U.S. Steel
tried to put us in the ground every day

20:12.669 --> 20:15.505
since these walls went up,
and every day, we stopped it.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.508
We gave as good as we got…

20:18.592 --> 20:20.844
[chuckles] …sometimes better.

20:21.553 --> 20:22.596
Me and Dad.

20:24.097 --> 20:25.599
And now it's just me.

20:27.351 --> 20:30.020
I've worked here since I was 15 years old.
Don't you dare--

20:30.103 --> 20:32.564
[scoffs] Yeah, you worked here.
I lived here.

20:32.648 --> 20:34.399
While you've been picking ties

20:34.483 --> 20:37.236
and going off like a lunatic
in front of the press,

20:37.319 --> 20:38.904
I've been trying to keep what we built

20:38.987 --> 20:41.698
from disappearing
in a puff of goddamn smoke.

20:43.533 --> 20:46.411
And since you weren't around,
I went ahead, and I spoke with the board.

20:47.204 --> 20:49.957
The only way we can hold on
to what's left of our assets

20:50.040 --> 20:52.834
is to shut down production,
at least for five months.

20:52.918 --> 20:54.753
We are not putting those guys
on the street.

20:54.836 --> 20:57.798
-We are. We are, Shel.
-Walter, we are not. We are not doing it!

20:57.881 --> 20:58.882
[shouts] We are!

21:05.555 --> 21:07.015
-[crowd clamoring]
-[man] Explain!

21:07.099 --> 21:09.559
Hold on.
I'm figuring this out as soon as I can.

21:09.643 --> 21:10.477
You owe us!

21:10.560 --> 21:12.604
Hold on! Hold on!

21:12.688 --> 21:16.566
Yes, the mill is closing, but I promise
I'm gonna get it back up and running--

21:16.650 --> 21:18.860
-To hell with your promises!
-What about our pensions?

21:18.944 --> 21:21.697
Your pensions, I'm gonna get them
back to you as soon as I can.

21:21.780 --> 21:24.324
-[clamoring continues]
-Get the hell back!

21:24.908 --> 21:27.577
Hold on one second. Listen, I'm--

21:27.661 --> 21:29.871
-You taking his side, Willie?
-We ain't taking shit!

21:29.955 --> 21:33.166
And we ain't going to jail
for beating up some rich kid, either.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.585
-[clamoring quietens]
-They're gonna need you at home,

21:35.669 --> 21:38.338
not rotting away in some jail cell.

21:38.422 --> 21:40.590
-What if it just makes me feel better?
-It won't.

21:40.674 --> 21:45.053
Come on, clear out your lockers
and go home to your families.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.430
-We'll make this right.
-[Willie] Go on.

21:46.513 --> 21:48.473
I hope it's a real nice wedding, Shel.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.183
[indistinct shouting]

21:50.767 --> 21:51.852
[Clyde] Really nice.

22:06.658 --> 22:07.492
Hmm.

22:08.785 --> 22:09.870
Put him in a suit.

22:10.746 --> 22:11.913
Put him in a tie.

22:14.499 --> 22:15.709
Put him in a box.

22:19.963 --> 22:21.965
"Everything ends up in a box."

22:26.136 --> 22:28.305
[sighs deeply]

22:29.806 --> 22:30.807
He said…

22:31.767 --> 22:33.435
He said, "I'll be right down."

22:35.604 --> 22:38.357
"Right down,"
like it's some kind of a goddamn joke.

22:40.108 --> 22:41.526
But I'm a… [sighs]

22:43.945 --> 22:46.448
I'm a dozen feet away, and I… I…

22:48.033 --> 22:49.326
I just stand there.

22:51.578 --> 22:53.372
[sighs]

23:00.128 --> 23:01.254
[Jane] Listen to me.

23:03.256 --> 23:04.674
You couldn't save him.

23:10.097 --> 23:11.848
You could not save him.

23:21.024 --> 23:24.027
-[Grace] Hey, honey, you ready?
-[Brandon] Just about.

23:26.029 --> 23:28.949
[Grace] What's going on with that tie?
You need some help?

23:29.574 --> 23:30.409
Come here.

23:37.833 --> 23:38.917
I can't do this.

23:39.376 --> 23:40.585
Yes, you can.

23:43.171 --> 23:44.756
[Brandon] I… I don't know what to say.

23:44.840 --> 23:45.882
You do know.

23:46.883 --> 23:48.802
You just speak from your heart.

23:51.513 --> 23:54.141
But, you know,
fear is a part of everything,

23:55.142 --> 23:56.893
but so is getting through it.

23:59.438 --> 24:00.856
[priest] Lord Jesus Christ,

24:00.939 --> 24:03.108
by your three days in the tomb,

24:03.859 --> 24:06.695
you hallowed the graves
of all who believe in you

24:07.195 --> 24:09.239
and made the grave a sign of hope

24:09.739 --> 24:14.161
that promises resurrection
even as it claims our mortal bodies.

24:15.787 --> 24:19.207
Grant that your children may sleep here
in peace

24:20.459 --> 24:22.669
until you awaken them to glory,

24:22.752 --> 24:25.881
for you are the resurrection and the life.

24:27.757 --> 24:29.885
Then will they see you face to face,

24:31.511 --> 24:33.388
and in your light, will see light

24:34.389 --> 24:38.018
and know the splendor of God,
for you live…

24:38.101 --> 24:39.144
Sheldon?

24:41.021 --> 24:42.772
I don't think she's coming.

24:44.983 --> 24:46.109
[Sheldon] It's funny.

24:46.776 --> 24:49.446
You never really know anybody
until they're gone, do you?

24:50.947 --> 24:52.949
That's when it's all stripped away, the…

24:54.367 --> 24:57.662
the lies that… that…
that hold you together, that blind you,

24:57.746 --> 24:59.247
blind you from seeing…

25:00.957 --> 25:02.334
[grunting]

25:02.417 --> 25:03.376
Sheldon?

25:03.460 --> 25:07.130
…the truth… [grunts] …you don't wanna see.

25:07.214 --> 25:08.048
Shel?

25:08.131 --> 25:09.174
[grunting]

25:10.509 --> 25:11.510
Sheldon!

25:12.761 --> 25:14.804
[indistinct shouting]

25:16.097 --> 25:18.350
-Sheldon!
-Somebody get a doctor!

25:20.769 --> 25:23.480
[priest]
Then will they see you face-to-face

25:24.064 --> 25:26.316
and know the splendor of God.

25:26.399 --> 25:28.944
-Amen.
-[crowd] Amen.

25:46.711 --> 25:49.005
[Brandon] Today we bury my friends.

25:50.674 --> 25:51.675
I knew them as Briggs,

25:53.843 --> 25:54.678
Vera,

25:57.722 --> 25:58.557
and Barry.

26:02.102 --> 26:05.313
They weren't their powers.
They weren't their uniforms.

26:05.397 --> 26:06.439
They were people.

26:07.774 --> 26:09.359
And I'm sorry they're gone.

26:12.904 --> 26:14.614
I'm sorry I failed them.

26:14.698 --> 26:16.866
I'm sorry I couldn't do more,

26:18.034 --> 26:19.327
couldn't be more.

26:22.914 --> 26:26.543
We're all reaching for something,
and we keep falling short of it.

26:28.837 --> 26:30.672
But not Briggs,

26:31.965 --> 26:33.466
not Vera and not Barry.

26:35.802 --> 26:36.845
They achieved it.

26:39.055 --> 26:40.098
They died heroes.

26:43.351 --> 26:44.603
And I envy them.

26:45.228 --> 26:47.147
-[woman] So sorry.
-[Brandon] Thank you for coming.

26:47.647 --> 26:49.357
-Thank you.
-Say hello to your mom.

26:52.110 --> 26:55.488
Hey. You did good out there, B.

26:56.990 --> 26:58.825
How you doing? You okay?

26:59.618 --> 27:01.703
She's alive. That's how.

27:03.163 --> 27:05.290
I won't forget
the reason she's still here.

27:06.416 --> 27:07.917
You did the right thing.

27:10.503 --> 27:11.338
Thank you.

27:11.421 --> 27:12.297
Bye.

27:13.506 --> 27:15.508
[indistinct chattering]

27:28.063 --> 27:29.272
How are they holding up?

27:31.191 --> 27:34.027
They saw Barry.
They saw it on the news, and

27:35.403 --> 27:38.114
-they didn't blur it out or cover it up.
-Jesus.

27:38.198 --> 27:42.952
I want them to forget. Ask your uncle?
He can go inside their heads and erase it.

27:43.036 --> 27:45.747
Like they never saw it.
They won't have to remember him that way.

27:45.830 --> 27:46.748
Karen,

27:47.707 --> 27:48.917
he doesn't do that,

27:49.876 --> 27:51.294
especially not to kids.

27:51.836 --> 27:54.339
Excuse me. Mrs. Bishop.

27:55.715 --> 27:57.384
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

27:57.967 --> 28:00.887
Boys over at the precinct
took up a collection.

28:00.970 --> 28:03.014
-Uh, it ain't much, but, uh…
-Thank you.

28:03.723 --> 28:05.892
-[officer] Least we could do.
-[Karen weeps]

28:09.688 --> 28:11.898
[Brandon] Anything you need, Karen,
you let me know, okay?

28:13.775 --> 28:15.318
[vehicle engine starts]

28:22.242 --> 28:23.660
There's too many funerals.

28:24.411 --> 28:25.412
Us and you.

28:27.288 --> 28:28.415
We're doing our best.

28:29.207 --> 28:30.709
I know you guys are too.

28:31.292 --> 28:34.212
Eh, there's doing,
and then there's getting it done.

28:35.130 --> 28:37.716
Ought to line them all up,
pop them one by one,

28:38.299 --> 28:39.968
just like you did Blackstar.

28:41.094 --> 28:42.929
Hole in the head. Problem solved.

28:43.012 --> 28:45.849
[ominous music playing]

28:51.938 --> 28:54.774
Half the people were patting him
on the back for killing Blackstar.

28:56.151 --> 28:59.404
Fitz too.
He wasn't even trying to hide it.

28:59.487 --> 29:01.823
How about that cop
that Brandon was talking to?

29:01.906 --> 29:04.117
These guys
are supposed to be upholding the law,

29:04.200 --> 29:07.162
not campaigning for mass executions.

29:11.082 --> 29:13.251
-I thought we were having a conversation.
-Oh.

29:13.334 --> 29:17.338
You were handling it fine by yourself.
You're good at that.

29:18.673 --> 29:20.258
I'm not Walt. I can't read your mind.

29:20.341 --> 29:23.511
I don't know. What do you want, Sheldon?
The world isn't the way you want it to be.

29:24.095 --> 29:26.222
You made that pretty clear
at the press conference.

29:26.306 --> 29:27.891
I couldn't stand there anymore, Grace.

29:27.974 --> 29:29.476
These people have no idea
what they're asking.

29:29.559 --> 29:32.896
You cannot control everything!
You have to stop.

29:32.979 --> 29:36.232
I mean, if you clamp down on this
the way you clamped down on the kids--

29:36.316 --> 29:38.151
We don't kill, ever, no exceptions.

29:38.234 --> 29:39.903
You know what?
If there weren't exceptions,

29:39.986 --> 29:41.905
we wouldn't be having
this conversation right now,

29:41.988 --> 29:43.865
because we'd be buried
next to Brandon's friends.

29:46.868 --> 29:47.952
[both sighing]

29:54.417 --> 29:57.545
[Grace] Sheldon, the supervillains
are changing the rules.

30:05.929 --> 30:08.223
I don't know why the hell
they can't have a nurse in here

30:08.306 --> 30:09.432
to keep an eye on him.

30:10.099 --> 30:11.309
We're paying them enough.

30:11.392 --> 30:13.228
I could do with a nurse or two myself.

30:13.311 --> 30:17.065
Can you shut it off for five minutes,
Hutchence? This isn't a joke.

30:17.148 --> 30:19.692
I wasn't joking.
I could use a nurse. [chuckles]

30:21.569 --> 30:25.031
-When's the last time a doctor came by?
-An hour ago.

30:25.114 --> 30:27.909
Yes, and he said the same thing
as the last one an hour before that.

30:27.992 --> 30:31.913
If there was something they could do,
they would do it. We just have to wait.

30:32.872 --> 30:34.916
You have to do that on his bed?
Go play on a table.

30:34.999 --> 30:37.085
I don't tell you
to stop wearing a hole in the floor.

30:37.168 --> 30:38.711
You don't tell me where to play cards.

30:38.795 --> 30:41.214
Get those cards off his bed,
or I'll do it for you.

30:41.297 --> 30:44.133
You try it, and I'll throw you
out the goddamn window.

30:44.217 --> 30:45.093
George!

30:45.969 --> 30:47.011
Sorry, Jane.

30:52.809 --> 30:53.810
[gasping]

30:53.893 --> 30:55.144
No, Dad!

30:57.605 --> 30:58.857
[Chester] Find the boat.

30:59.732 --> 31:00.942
[gasping]

31:01.025 --> 31:02.443
[Chester] Gather your crew.

31:02.527 --> 31:03.528
Sheldon. Sheldon?

31:08.950 --> 31:12.370
[Chester]
Sail to the island and save America.

31:12.871 --> 31:13.872
[gasping]

31:13.955 --> 31:15.498
Get the doctor. Go!

31:15.582 --> 31:17.876
Okay. All right.
You're in the hospital. All right?

31:17.959 --> 31:20.628
-You had a seizure at the service.
-[grunting]

31:22.380 --> 31:24.132
[panting]

31:24.215 --> 31:25.258
I'm alive?

31:25.842 --> 31:27.635
You gave us a good scare,
I'll tell you what.

31:27.719 --> 31:29.554
[chuckles] You're here.

31:29.637 --> 31:32.390
You're with us, all right?
You're in the hospital.

31:32.473 --> 31:33.892
[panting]

31:35.727 --> 31:37.228
[whispers] I saw something.

31:37.854 --> 31:38.813
What did you see?

31:39.898 --> 31:40.732
[Sheldon] An island.

31:42.066 --> 31:43.234
I think it was…

31:43.318 --> 31:45.111
[panting]

31:45.194 --> 31:48.323
I think it was some kind of a m… message.

31:49.115 --> 31:50.825
[grunting, panting]

31:50.909 --> 31:51.910
A message?

31:54.162 --> 31:55.538
A message from who, Shel?

31:55.622 --> 31:59.292
[grunts, pants]

31:59.375 --> 32:00.376
From Dad.

32:04.589 --> 32:08.384
[ominous music playing]

32:13.556 --> 32:15.558
[dramatic music playing]
