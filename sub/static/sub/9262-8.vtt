my name out of it.

11:01.526 --> 11:03.060

Hey, listen to me, listen to me.
Just listen to me.

11:21.513 --> 11:22.679
Okay? Listen to me.

11:22.680 --> 11:24.548
The best long term solution

11:24.549 --> 11:26.717
is we pretend
like we never even talked.

11:26.718 --> 11:28.853
I mean, you never
pointed a finger at Two-Man.

ever asks you, okay?

11:34.092 --> 11:35.292
Okay.

11:35.293 --> 11:36.360
Now, where do I find him?

11:36.361 --> 11:38.429
He got peoples around the way.

11:38.430 --> 11:40.731

42:29.279 --> 42:32.815
So it's kiss-my-ass time.

42:44.227 --> 42:47.162
Mackey, you do not interfere
with this case.

42:47.163 --> 42:48.798
Seeing as how
I'm not a cop anymore,

42:48.799 --> 42:50.733
you really don't have
jurisdiction

42:50.734 --> 42:52.334
over what I do, captain.

42:52.335 --> 42:53.836
You rogue out on this,

42:53.837 --> 42:58.040
you do anything sideways
like you did with Lemansky,

42:58.041 --> 43:00.809
and I'll lock up your corrupt
ass faster than you can say:

43:00.810 --> 43:03.545
"How'd I lose this job?"

43:04.881 --> 43:07.516
This is all that's left
of this job.

43:08.585 --> 43:10.419
I don't want it.

43:46.756 --> 43:48.424
