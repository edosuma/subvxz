17:19.960 --> 17:21.670
The whole point of this night
was to cheer you up.

17:21.670 --> 17:23.500
I totally failed.

17:23.500 --> 17:25.290
Honey, everything
about tonight

17:25.290 --> 17:27.579
was incredible.
Was it?

17:27.579 --> 17:30.750
It's like your father
was everywhere!

17:30.750 --> 17:33.290
I even found a memento
in my pocket.

17:33.290 --> 17:34.580
Did you?

17:34.580 --> 17:38.620
I remember,
when we were in Morocco,

17:38.620 --> 17:40.170
your father
stepped on this...

17:40.170 --> 17:41.040
Oh.

17:41.040 --> 17:42.040
...barefoot.

17:42.040 --> 17:43.500
He was not a shoe guy.

17:43.500 --> 17:46.960
We got asked to leave
many restaurants.
[ Laughs ]

17:48.960 --> 17:50.710
It all just snuck up on me,
Mom.

17:50.710 --> 17:55.380
Yeah, you've been working
so hard to keep him alive,

17:55.380 --> 17:56.960
you haven't totally
faced the fact

17:56.960 --> 17:59.040
that he's not with us
anymore.

17:59.040 --> 18:00.880
Nope.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.120
Just let go of the pressure
to be strong

18:03.120 --> 18:06.210
and make a space to feel it.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.330
Ruby was right.

Hey.

You, uh...

18:22.750 --> 18:25.920
You want to talk about
what happened out there?

18:25.920 --> 18:27.040
Wasn't planning on it.

18:27.040 --> 18:29.210
I get it.

18:29.210 --> 18:30.750
We're Johnson men.

18:30.750 --> 18:32.380
That's not our way.

18:32.380 --> 18:34.120
We're stoic.

18:34.120 --> 18:35.710
Yeah, suffer in silence.

18:35.710 --> 18:38.250
You're doing a lot of talking
for somebody whose way it isn't.

18:38.250 --> 18:39.620
Hey, Pops, I'm just saying,

18:39.620 --> 18:42.330
I get why you don't want
to talk about death.

18:42.330 --> 18:44.290
Death is scary,

18:44.290 --> 18:46.250
and talking about it
makes it real.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.210
I know it's real, dummy.
It's death.

18:49.790 --> 18:53.170
Look, seeing Bow
standing up there crying

18:53.170 --> 18:55.960
made me realize that my death
isn't going to be about me.

18:55.960 --> 18:57.210
It's going to be about you.

18:57.210 --> 18:59.500
You're going to be the one
standing up there crying.

And if you want to know
what my wishes are

19:01.460 --> 19:04.170
so that you can move on, I'd
like to give that to you, son.

19:05.620 --> 19:07.420
Thanks, Pops.

19:07.420 --> 19:11.330
First, I want to be buried
right here in L.A.

19:11.330 --> 19:14.670
That way, you can come visit
and we can have a drink

19:14.670 --> 19:17.920
and you can keep me up on
all the family business.

19:17.920 --> 19:19.250
Sounds good.

19:19.250 --> 19:22.210
For my funeral,
all this backyard business

19:22.210 --> 19:23.710
may be good enough
for Tommy Bahama.

19:23.710 --> 19:25.500
For me, you rent a hall --

19:25.500 --> 19:27.620
and a place that's just
a little too small

19:27.620 --> 19:29.500
so not everybody can get in.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.170
You hear me?

19:31.170 --> 19:32.210
You got it.

Whatever you do...
Mm-hmm?

...do not bury me
next to your mother.

And if I die first,
you don't tell her I'm dead

19:38.750 --> 19:41.250
until after you bury me,

to do bad things to my body.

Yeah, but you only
felt better
