WEBVTT

00:03.065 --> 00:04.331
How you doing?

00:04.333 --> 00:06.300
I'm hungry.
We got any cereal?

00:06.302 --> 00:07.635
Yeah, Cheerios.

00:07.637 --> 00:09.036
I'll have that.

00:09.038 --> 00:10.871
Bowls are in the cabinet.
Help yourself.

00:10.873 --> 00:12.406
Mom used to
get it for me.

00:12.408 --> 00:13.674
Okay.

00:13.676 --> 00:15.910
Well, I'm not your mom.

00:15.912 --> 00:16.944
No kidding.

00:16.946 --> 00:18.479
What are you
getting at, kid?

00:18.481 --> 00:19.714
What's bothering you?

00:19.716 --> 00:22.383
Mom didn't have to get me
cereal, but she did.

00:22.385 --> 00:24.752
She didn't have to put little
notes in my lunch, but she did.

00:24.754 --> 00:28.556
She didn't have to plan family
trips for us, but she did.

00:28.558 --> 00:30.891
Meanwhile, I've asked you,
like, five times,

00:30.893 --> 00:33.360
if we can get a basketball hoop
for this house,

00:33.362 --> 00:34.862
we still don't have one.

00:43.972 --> 00:47.575
I'm not leaving until
I speak to Theresa Hill.

00:47.577 --> 00:49.777
And I already explained to you,
you can't see her.

00:49.779 --> 00:52.079
I won't leave until
I see Theresa Hill.

00:52.081 --> 00:53.581
Lady, you can demand
all you want.

00:53.583 --> 00:55.516
You're not seeing her.
Step aside.

00:55.518 --> 00:57.685
I won't step aside.

00:57.687 --> 00:58.753
You're holding up the line.

00:58.755 --> 01:00.020
Next.
No. No, no, no, no.

01:00.022 --> 01:01.489
I am not moving!

01:01.491 --> 01:02.757
Out of the way, bitch!

01:02.759 --> 01:04.425
- No!
- Really?

01:04.427 --> 01:06.160
- Settle down.
- No.

01:06.162 --> 01:07.528
No. Get your hands off of me!

01:07.530 --> 01:08.696
Hey, settle down!

01:08.698 --> 01:09.964
That's it.
You're under arrest.

01:09.966 --> 01:11.999
What-- No--
Let me go!

01:12.001 --> 01:13.701
Get your hands off of me!
(handcuffs clicking)

01:13.703 --> 01:16.270
I am here to see Theresa Hill!

01:16.272 --> 01:17.238
Get her out of here.

01:17.240 --> 01:18.539
Take her out.

01:19.541 --> 01:20.741
Next.

01:20.743 --> 01:23.077
My point is, don't let
yourself feel guilty

01:23.079 --> 01:24.478
because Linda's
not around anymore.

01:24.480 --> 01:25.913
Little too late
for that.

01:25.915 --> 01:27.114
Excuse me.

01:27.116 --> 01:29.183
Detectives Reagan and Baez.
You got an assault?

01:29.185 --> 01:30.651
Faith Madson.

01:30.653 --> 01:31.919
Contusions and a laceration.

01:31.921 --> 01:33.654
Said her jerk ex-boyfriend
beat her up.

01:33.656 --> 01:35.990
She's in 12A.
(woman screaming)

01:35.992 --> 01:38.325
MAN:
Hey, that guy's hurting her!

01:39.261 --> 01:40.961
Police! Hey!
MAN: Call security right now!

01:40.963 --> 01:42.530
Get your hands off her.

01:46.067 --> 01:47.468
BAEZ: This the same guy
that assaulted you earlier?

01:47.470 --> 01:49.336
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Raymond Stevens.

01:49.338 --> 01:50.771
(grunts)
Ow!

01:50.773 --> 01:51.839
Help me out here!

01:51.841 --> 01:53.174
Cuff him.

01:53.176 --> 01:54.775
Bitch!
Shut up.

01:54.777 --> 01:56.143
STEVENS: Ow!
DANNY: Yeah, the only bitch

01:56.145 --> 01:58.245
is gonna be you,
when you're locked up

01:58.247 --> 02:00.981
for assault
and strangulation, punk.

02:00.983 --> 02:03.284
Get him out of here.

02:05.020 --> 02:07.121
Hey, you got a woman
in distress?

02:07.123 --> 02:08.255
Yes.

02:08.257 --> 02:10.056
She's right in here.
I called 911

02:10.059 --> 02:12.560
as soon as it started, but
I don't know what to do.

02:12.562 --> 02:14.895
(woman groaning loudly)

02:14.897 --> 02:16.230
Ma'am?

02:16.232 --> 02:19.033
(groaning continues)

02:20.402 --> 02:22.303
Ma'am, are you okay?

02:22.305 --> 02:24.805
This is Officer Reagan.
I'm Officer Janko. (speaking Spanish)

02:24.807 --> 02:26.841
(yelling)

02:26.843 --> 02:28.475
JANKO:
Central, 12 David.

02:28.477 --> 02:31.111
We have a woman in labor
at 135 East 90th Street.

02:31.113 --> 02:32.947
We need a bus
really quick,

02:32.949 --> 02:35.015
and I mean put a rush
on that bus.

02:35.017 --> 02:36.817
That was another contraction?
Y-Yes.

02:36.819 --> 02:38.018
Okay, just stay calm.

02:38.020 --> 02:39.620
I've delivered babies before.

02:39.622 --> 02:41.822
You're gonna be fine.
Deep breaths, okay?

02:41.824 --> 02:43.057
(screaming)

02:43.059 --> 02:45.392
Jamie, Jamie, no.

02:45.394 --> 02:46.894
- No.
- You're gonna okay.

02:46.896 --> 02:48.662
All right? We're here to help you.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

02:48.664 --> 02:50.331
Deep breaths, okay?
You're gonna be okay.

02:50.333 --> 02:51.532

02:52.767 --> 02:54.902

Where's that bus?

03:23.090 --> 03:25.449
All right, we see the head.
We're almost there, okay?

03:25.450 --> 03:27.884
You're doing great, Angela.
(panting): Okay.

03:27.886 --> 03:29.919
One more big push, all right?

03:29.921 --> 03:32.255
- All right, you're doing great.
- You're doing great, Angela. Doing great.

03:32.257 --> 03:33.690
You're doing great.
(Angela yelling)

03:33.692 --> 03:34.991
I got a shoulder.

03:34.993 --> 03:36.426
(screaming)
Push! Push!

03:37.995 --> 03:39.862
(baby crying)

03:39.864 --> 03:41.998
It's a boy.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.566
Okay. It's a boy.

03:43.568 --> 03:45.601
Isn't that perfect?

03:45.603 --> 03:46.569
He's okay.

03:46.571 --> 03:49.072
<i>Está bien. Está bien.</i>
Oh, my God.

03:49.074 --> 03:50.873
He's okay, he's okay.
<i>Está bien.</i>

03:50.875 --> 03:52.575
Yep, he's breathing.
He's okay.

03:52.577 --> 03:53.976
Wow. Wow.
He's okay.

03:53.978 --> 03:56.245
(laughing)
It's okay.

03:56.247 --> 03:58.781
(sighs, laughs)

03:58.783 --> 04:00.650
(speaks Spanish)

04:01.785 --> 04:04.120
(Angela crying)

04:04.122 --> 04:06.456
A beautiful, healthy boy.

04:06.458 --> 04:09.625
GARRETT: <i>You accept the award,</i>
<i>you say a few words,</i>

04:09.627 --> 04:12.962
and we can be out of there
before the appetizers arrive.

04:12.964 --> 04:14.564
Maybe get some to go?

04:16.065 --> 04:19.135
Sir, Shelly Wayne is here.

04:19.137 --> 04:20.769
GORMLEY:
Shelly Wayne?

04:20.772 --> 04:22.605
Who cleared that?
Who let her in?

04:22.607 --> 04:24.674
She was pre-cleared, apparently.

04:24.676 --> 04:26.676
I did.

04:26.678 --> 04:28.277
Wouldn't that go through me?

04:28.279 --> 04:30.813
It could, but apparently,
it did not.

04:30.815 --> 04:31.848
What is she doing here?

04:31.850 --> 04:33.416
Accepting my invitation.

04:33.418 --> 04:35.485
Thank you very much, everybody.

04:48.632 --> 04:50.266
Please.

04:59.309 --> 05:00.710
(sighs)

05:02.679 --> 05:05.047
It's a trumped-up charge.

05:05.049 --> 05:06.416
Not what I heard.

05:06.418 --> 05:10.086
I spent two solid hours
waiting to get into Rikers,

05:10.088 --> 05:12.688
and when I get there, they
tell me I can't go in? Come on!

05:12.690 --> 05:14.590
The woman I was
there visiting...

05:14.592 --> 05:16.225
Is a repeat offender.

05:16.227 --> 05:18.728
Weapons possession,
shoplifting, assault.

05:18.730 --> 05:21.330
You're the one who told
me to find purpose.

05:21.332 --> 05:22.865
Find purpose, not get arrested.

05:22.867 --> 05:25.134
I am ministering to
the inmates there.

05:25.136 --> 05:27.270
<i>That</i> is purpose.

05:27.272 --> 05:29.238
And this woman told me...

05:29.240 --> 05:31.007
This career criminal told you.

05:31.009 --> 05:33.810
Told me that she
witnessed a murder.

05:33.812 --> 05:37.647
And ever since then, they
refused to let me in to see her.

05:37.649 --> 05:40.516
So there's a conspiracy to
keep you away from the inmates?

05:40.518 --> 05:41.818
Just Theresa Hill--

05:41.820 --> 05:44.153
who swears that a guard
killed her friend.

05:44.155 --> 05:48.024
Yes, it's clearly
an order from above.

05:48.026 --> 05:50.193
Clear to you, maybe.
I don't expect you

05:50.195 --> 05:52.195
to believe me,

05:52.197 --> 05:55.932
or understand, because
you don't know what it's like

05:55.934 --> 05:58.100
not to have a voice.

05:58.102 --> 06:01.065
Getting arrested doesn't
give you a voice, Shelly,

06:01.067 --> 06:02.049
it gives you a record.

06:02.050 --> 06:03.783
Don't play me for that.

06:03.785 --> 06:06.519
And don't play this
"us versus them" song for me.

06:06.521 --> 06:08.154
I asked you here.

06:08.156 --> 06:09.822
Why do you think?

06:09.824 --> 06:10.756
To lecture me.

06:10.758 --> 06:12.458
- Oh, come on.
- Oh, come on nothing.

06:12.460 --> 06:14.193
Talking to you is like

06:14.195 --> 06:17.330
talking to a paragon
of virtue or something.

06:17.332 --> 06:21.000
Hard to have a real
conversation with a paragon.

06:21.002 --> 06:22.268
Okay, I give up.

06:22.270 --> 06:24.537
Good luck. Good afternoon.

06:27.841 --> 06:29.875
(sighs)

06:31.912 --> 06:34.513
All right.

06:34.515 --> 06:36.449
Truce.

06:41.421 --> 06:44.223
Thank you for
reaching out.

06:44.225 --> 06:46.592
You're welcome.

06:46.594 --> 06:51.497
I am certain that she
is telling the truth.

06:53.967 --> 06:56.202
I'm not.

06:57.938 --> 06:59.405
JANKO:
He's beautiful.

06:59.407 --> 07:00.906
How can I thank you?

07:00.908 --> 07:02.608
JAMIE: Just take
good care of him.

07:02.610 --> 07:04.477
Can we get in contact
with your husband for you?

07:04.479 --> 07:07.013
Um, he doesn't have
a cell phone.

07:07.015 --> 07:09.248
Just give us an address.

07:09.250 --> 07:12.818
71-30 Woodside Avenue.

07:12.820 --> 07:14.286
We'll let you guys work.

07:14.288 --> 07:15.988
JANKO:
That was amazing.

07:15.990 --> 07:17.790
<i>You</i> were amazing.

07:17.792 --> 07:19.291
I hardly did anything.

07:19.293 --> 07:20.993
You did way
more than me.

07:20.995 --> 07:23.729
I had no idea you've
delivered a baby before.

07:23.731 --> 07:25.898
Uh, oh, I haven't.
What?

07:25.900 --> 07:29.235
You know, I just said that
so that she would stay calm.

07:29.237 --> 07:31.470
(chuckles) Well, you're
really good at faking,

07:31.472 --> 07:34.106
because I thought you knew
exactly what you were doing.

07:34.108 --> 07:35.875
Do you want
to have kids?

07:35.877 --> 07:37.009
What?

07:37.011 --> 07:38.944
When my dad was arrested,
he just kept saying,

07:38.946 --> 07:40.112
"I did this for you."

07:40.114 --> 07:41.781
And I remember thinking,
I'll never have kids,

07:41.783 --> 07:43.015
'cause I don't
want to blame them

07:43.017 --> 07:44.884
for screwing my life up
the way that he did.

07:44.886 --> 07:46.686
You know what I mean?

07:46.688 --> 07:49.522
So you <i>don't</i> want
to have kids?

07:49.524 --> 07:52.658
Did you see the
look on her face?

07:52.660 --> 07:55.227
She fell in love the
second she saw that baby.

07:55.229 --> 07:57.396
It was instantaneous.

07:57.398 --> 07:58.998
I just thought,

07:59.000 --> 08:01.567
someday I want to experience
what that feels like.

08:01.569 --> 08:03.769
Me, too.

08:09.109 --> 08:10.209
(sirens wailing in distance)

08:10.211 --> 08:12.078
FAITH:
<i>Raymond was the first guy</i>

08:12.080 --> 08:13.679
I've gone out with,

08:13.681 --> 08:16.082
and... he was great
in the beginning.

08:16.084 --> 08:17.483
They usually are.

08:17.485 --> 08:19.585
Yeah. I don't know,
I guess I just miss

08:19.587 --> 08:21.253
being part of a couple,
you know?

08:21.255 --> 08:22.822
(sighs):
I get it.

08:22.824 --> 08:25.024
Yeah. See, you're married;
I'm sure you understand.

08:25.026 --> 08:28.060
Actually, my wife passed away
six months ago.

08:28.062 --> 08:30.096
I know about that.

08:30.098 --> 08:31.964
- I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.

08:31.966 --> 08:33.599
Um, let's get back to Raymond.

08:33.601 --> 08:34.667
Yeah.

08:34.669 --> 08:36.869
When did he start
becoming violent?

08:36.871 --> 08:38.404
About a month ago.

08:38.405 --> 08:41.506
He... came to pick me up
at work at the hospital.

08:41.509 --> 08:42.674
You a nurse?

08:42.677 --> 08:43.976
Uh, yeah. Saint Irene's.

08:43.977 --> 08:47.713
And he saw me walking out,
talking to a male coworker,

08:47.715 --> 08:49.081
and he got really angry.

08:49.083 --> 08:51.784
And I thought maybe he was
just having a bad day,

08:51.786 --> 08:54.520
but then he started
sending me...

08:54.522 --> 08:57.490
threatening texts and,
uh, demanding to know

08:57.492 --> 09:00.392
who I ate lunch with and
who I was talking to.

09:00.394 --> 09:01.961
And that's when I ended it.

09:01.963 --> 09:03.195
That was smart.

09:03.197 --> 09:05.331
I feel like such a fool.

09:05.333 --> 09:07.666
Listen, it's really not
your fault.

09:07.668 --> 09:10.336
Okay. Uh, so
what happens now?

09:10.338 --> 09:11.871
Well, Raymond
is being charged

09:11.873 --> 09:13.806
with assault and strangulation.

09:13.808 --> 09:15.374
And how do I know
he'll leave me alone?

09:15.376 --> 09:16.942
You don't.

09:16.944 --> 09:19.078
So you should probably apply
for an order of protection.

09:19.080 --> 09:22.314
It basically says he can't
come within 500 feet of you.

09:22.316 --> 09:24.683
Or make any contact
with you at all.

09:24.685 --> 09:26.719
Well, what if he
shows up somewhere?

09:26.721 --> 09:28.521
Call 911.

09:29.389 --> 09:31.056
Or you could...

09:31.058 --> 09:33.192
call me direct, okay?

09:33.194 --> 09:34.827
This is my number.

09:34.829 --> 09:37.096
He shows up, call right away.

09:37.098 --> 09:38.731
All right. Your hand.

09:38.733 --> 09:40.733
Yeah. Hazards of the job.

09:40.735 --> 09:42.735
Come here.

09:42.737 --> 09:44.370
I'm a nurse.

09:45.739 --> 09:49.141
You need to get it cleaned up,
and you might need an X-ray.

09:49.143 --> 09:51.177
I will.

09:52.746 --> 09:53.779
Thanks.

09:53.781 --> 09:55.281
All right.

09:55.283 --> 09:56.448
You be careful, all right?

09:56.450 --> 09:58.284
Yeah. Appreciate it.

10:02.522 --> 10:04.523
You sure this is
the right address?

10:04.525 --> 10:06.125
Yeah, this is it.

10:06.127 --> 10:08.894
Well, I guess maybe having
a baby in a movie theater

10:08.896 --> 10:10.262
isn't the worst idea.

10:10.264 --> 10:11.831
(sighs)

10:11.833 --> 10:13.465
(sighs)

10:14.701 --> 10:16.769
(knock on door)

10:16.771 --> 10:17.970
(door creaks)

10:17.972 --> 10:19.205
Hi.

10:19.207 --> 10:21.574
I'm Officer Janko.
This is Officer Reagan.

10:21.576 --> 10:22.875
<i>No hablo inglés.</i>

10:22.877 --> 10:25.211
<i>Policía.</i>
<i>¿Podemos entrar?</i>

10:26.079 --> 10:27.513
Oh.

10:38.291 --> 10:40.726
(speaking Spanish)

10:40.728 --> 10:41.827
(speaking Spanish)

10:41.829 --> 10:43.529
- Five?
- <i>Sí.</i>

10:43.531 --> 10:45.564
We're looking for Mr. Alvarez?

10:45.566 --> 10:47.766
(speaking Spanish)

10:50.270 --> 10:51.637
(speaking Spanish)

10:51.639 --> 10:53.606
<i>Sí. Sí.</i>

10:53.608 --> 10:55.307
Eddie.

10:55.309 --> 10:58.110
We got to report this to FDNY
and Department of Buildings.

10:58.112 --> 10:59.545
They could lose their home.

10:59.547 --> 11:02.047
DANNY:
<i>Tell your brother</i>

11:02.049 --> 11:03.415
I'll pick you guys up
some take-out.

11:03.417 --> 11:05.484
I'll be home in about an hour,
okay, buddy?

11:05.486 --> 11:07.853
All right, see you then.

11:07.855 --> 11:09.688
(phone ringing)

11:11.591 --> 11:12.825
Reagan.

11:12.827 --> 11:14.159
(tires screeching)

11:14.161 --> 11:15.427
FAITH:
Help me!

11:15.429 --> 11:16.762
He's gonna kill me!

11:16.764 --> 11:18.163
Where are you?
FAITH: Oh, my God!

11:18.165 --> 11:19.765
He's trying...
he's trying to kill me.

11:19.767 --> 11:20.767
Who? Who?

11:21.468 --> 11:22.902
Oh, my God.

11:22.904 --> 11:24.737
He's crashing into my car!

11:24.739 --> 11:25.871
Faith!

11:25.873 --> 11:27.539
Is it Raymond?
FAITH: I don't know.

11:27.541 --> 11:29.108
Oh, my God, I don't know!

11:29.110 --> 11:31.543
Okay, Faith, where are you?

11:31.545 --> 11:34.280
I'm-I'm driving. I'm on,
I'm on the West Side Highway.

11:34.282 --> 11:35.414
Where on the West Side Highway?

11:35.416 --> 11:36.682
I... (sobs)

11:36.684 --> 11:38.150
I don't know.
Oh, my God, I don't know!

11:38.152 --> 11:39.151
Faith!

11:39.153 --> 11:40.452
What exit are you passing?

11:40.454 --> 11:43.923
Um, I... I just...
I just passed 96th Street.

11:45.458 --> 11:46.992
Oh, God. God, please help me.

11:46.994 --> 11:48.093
Listen to me.

11:48.095 --> 11:49.895
You got to get off, okay?
Get off at

11:49.897 --> 11:53.098
79th Street, make a right off
the exit, go down five blocks.

11:53.100 --> 11:55.100
On your right
is the 5-4 Precinct, okay?

11:55.102 --> 11:56.502
I'll be waiting for you.

11:57.504 --> 11:58.671
(sobbing)

11:58.673 --> 12:01.040
Faith? Faith?!

12:11.074 --> 12:12.807
- Reagan?
- Thanks.

12:14.677 --> 12:16.110
You okay?

12:16.112 --> 12:17.679
Not really.

12:17.681 --> 12:20.114
- Ah. Who was it? Raymond?
- I don't know.

12:20.116 --> 12:21.783
I mean, I thought
he was under arrest.

12:21.785 --> 12:23.618
He was, but I spoke
to the court.

12:23.620 --> 12:26.721
They said he was released on his
own recognizance an hour ago.

12:26.723 --> 12:29.290
I don't know. It was so dark,
I couldn't see, but who else?

12:29.292 --> 12:30.758
Could you make out
the license plate?

12:30.760 --> 12:32.627
The car?
Um...

12:32.629 --> 12:34.329
Uh, no. I'm-I'm sorry.
Okay.

12:34.331 --> 12:35.797
We have cameras
along the route?

12:35.799 --> 12:37.899
We're checking the service road
where she got off.

12:37.901 --> 12:40.301
Okay, what if, what if
he comes after me again?

12:40.303 --> 12:43.037
I mean, I'm...
I'm so afraid to go home.

12:43.039 --> 12:44.506
Relax. I'll take
you home, all right?

12:44.508 --> 12:46.508
Let's get a radio car
sitting on her place.

12:46.510 --> 12:47.809
No problem.

12:47.811 --> 12:48.810
Thank you.

12:48.812 --> 12:50.378
Okay. Come on.

12:50.380 --> 12:52.580
Gonna be all right.
(sniffles)

12:52.582 --> 12:54.682
GORMLEY: The inmate in question
was found strangled

12:54.684 --> 12:57.519
with a bed sheet
around her neck.

12:57.521 --> 12:59.387
It was ruled a suicide.

12:59.389 --> 13:02.323
Ruled and <i>was</i> a suicide?

13:02.325 --> 13:03.758
I got the M.E.

13:03.760 --> 13:07.428
taking a second look at it,
but Rikers isn't cooperating.

13:07.430 --> 13:08.696
They say they can't locate

13:08.698 --> 13:10.798
the security footage
from that day,

13:10.800 --> 13:12.634
and the correction
officer who's accused

13:12.636 --> 13:14.469
has a history
of sexual assault.

13:14.471 --> 13:17.005
Two complaints on his record,
neither of which

13:17.007 --> 13:18.540
have been investigated.

13:18.542 --> 13:20.775
So, it's fair to say there could
be something to these claims.

13:20.777 --> 13:23.077
Well, certainly enough
to open an investigation,

13:23.079 --> 13:24.178
yes, sir.

13:24.180 --> 13:27.115
And what is it
you're not saying?

13:27.117 --> 13:29.684
I'm just a little lost here.

13:29.686 --> 13:31.386
In that?

13:31.388 --> 13:32.754
In that I don't want to rain

13:32.756 --> 13:35.023
on the Shelly Wayne parade
that's going on in here.

13:35.025 --> 13:36.291
What's that mean?

13:36.293 --> 13:37.792
That a loose cannon
from the community

13:37.794 --> 13:39.060
has the ear of this office

13:39.062 --> 13:40.995
in a way that's
out of the usual flow.

13:40.997 --> 13:42.997
You, too?

13:42.999 --> 13:45.266
No, boss, uh...
No?

13:45.268 --> 13:48.369
Well, but he has
a little point.

13:48.371 --> 13:49.571
That being?

13:49.573 --> 13:50.838
Chain of command

13:50.840 --> 13:52.140
would usually have us vetting

13:52.142 --> 13:53.541
walk-in business
from a Shelly Wayne.

13:53.543 --> 13:56.044
Well, it's not like,
all of a sudden,

13:56.046 --> 13:57.745
that's just an open door.

13:57.747 --> 13:59.013
Just for her.

13:59.015 --> 14:00.048
No, not just for her.

14:00.050 --> 14:01.749
But not just
for you two, either.

14:01.751 --> 14:03.418
Understood.

14:03.420 --> 14:04.519
Anything else?

14:04.521 --> 14:06.487
You open up a Twitter account
or anything?

14:06.489 --> 14:08.456
That a joke?
Oh, we'd just like to know

14:08.458 --> 14:09.757
where we fit in in the pipeline.

14:09.759 --> 14:12.360
Right where you always are.

14:12.362 --> 14:13.761
Just checking.

14:13.763 --> 14:15.563
Ms. Wayne called

14:15.565 --> 14:19.367
a local radio show an hour ago,
and called corruption

14:19.369 --> 14:20.568
on the Department
of Corrections,

14:20.570 --> 14:21.869
and accused the NYPD

14:21.871 --> 14:25.173
of being complicit in covering
up the murder of an inmate

14:25.175 --> 14:26.808
by a C.O.

14:26.810 --> 14:28.776
You kidding me?

14:28.778 --> 14:31.279
She hung you out to dry.

14:35.751 --> 14:37.552
(door creaks)

14:37.554 --> 14:39.420
Okay, come on in.
Okay.

14:39.422 --> 14:41.556
- Gonna have you wait right here, okay?
-Yeah.

14:41.558 --> 14:42.824
Just gonna check
and make sure...

14:42.826 --> 14:44.058
Okay.

14:44.060 --> 14:45.293
...nobody's here.

14:46.161 --> 14:47.929
How long you lived here?

14:47.931 --> 14:49.297
Uh, about five years.

14:49.299 --> 14:50.398
I'm gonna take

14:50.400 --> 14:52.533
a quick peek upstairs, okay?

14:52.535 --> 14:53.668
You live alone?

14:53.670 --> 14:55.637
My husband...

14:55.639 --> 14:58.373
uh... he passed away.

14:58.375 --> 14:59.474
Okay.

14:59.476 --> 15:01.709
It's all clear.

15:01.711 --> 15:03.845
Uh, can I get you something?
Like a beer, or...?

15:03.847 --> 15:06.180
No, thank you.
I'm gonna head out.

15:06.182 --> 15:07.982
Yeah? Okay.
Yeah.

15:11.487 --> 15:13.621
You sure you're okay?

15:13.623 --> 15:15.623
Yes. Yes, yes, yes. I will be.

15:15.625 --> 15:17.825
I just-- it just
really rattled me.

15:17.827 --> 15:19.761
Tell you what.

15:19.763 --> 15:20.862
I know you're not okay.

15:20.864 --> 15:22.497
I'll keep you company
for a few minutes.

15:22.499 --> 15:24.065
I'm off duty anyway.

15:24.067 --> 15:25.566
What the hell, I'll take a beer.

15:25.568 --> 15:27.568
- Yeah?
- Sure.

15:30.105 --> 15:33.441
So how'd you meet
this Raymond character, anyway?

15:33.443 --> 15:34.509
Oh, God, it's embarrassing.

15:34.511 --> 15:35.610
- Try me.
- Yes.

15:35.612 --> 15:38.112
He... I met him
on a dating site.

15:38.114 --> 15:39.614
Wow.

15:39.616 --> 15:41.249
Yes.
Okay.

15:41.251 --> 15:42.250
Which one?

15:42.252 --> 15:45.520
The one aimed at
lonely, dumb-ass widows.

15:45.522 --> 15:47.455
Oh. I'll be sure to avoid it.

15:47.457 --> 15:48.589
(laughs)

15:48.591 --> 15:51.626
That and the one for
lonely, dumb-ass farmers.

15:51.628 --> 15:52.927
Mm-hmm. (chuckles)

15:52.929 --> 15:54.829
And what about your husband?
Uh, what'd he do?

15:54.831 --> 15:57.131
He was a cop.

15:57.900 --> 16:00.134
Nice.
Yes. Bronx narcotics.

16:00.136 --> 16:02.837
Wow. Interesting.
Yep.

16:02.839 --> 16:04.405
And your-your wife?

16:04.407 --> 16:07.075
She was a nurse,
ironically enough.

16:07.077 --> 16:09.310
Yep.
Yeah.

16:12.114 --> 16:13.281
Um...

16:13.283 --> 16:15.016
(sighs)

16:15.018 --> 16:17.218
I better get going.

16:17.220 --> 16:18.986
Yeah, it's getting late.

16:18.988 --> 16:20.722
Yeah. Um...

16:20.724 --> 16:22.824
Car will be outside all night.

16:22.826 --> 16:24.192
Thank you.
And...

16:24.194 --> 16:25.259
So don't be scared.

16:25.261 --> 16:27.462
And if you need anything,
you have my card.

16:27.464 --> 16:28.863
Yes.

16:28.865 --> 16:30.364
Don't hesitate to call.

16:30.366 --> 16:33.901
(door opens, closes)

16:38.373 --> 16:39.640
Hi.

16:39.642 --> 16:42.176
<i>Gracias.</i> Thank you, thank you,
thank you so much.

16:42.178 --> 16:44.479
JAMIE: Congratulations
on your baby.

16:44.481 --> 16:45.680
(baby whimpering)

16:45.682 --> 16:48.049
You want to...
do you want to hold him?

16:48.051 --> 16:50.218
No, no.
That's okay. No, no.

16:51.120 --> 16:53.354
Uh, Mr. and
Mrs. Alvarez,

16:53.356 --> 16:54.989
we went to your
house, and, uh,

16:54.991 --> 16:57.325
there were some serious
fire code violations.

16:57.327 --> 16:58.493
I don't understand.

16:58.495 --> 17:01.529
The Department of Buildings
shut your place down.

17:01.531 --> 17:02.997
What?

17:02.999 --> 17:05.833
We are... kicked out
of our home?

17:05.835 --> 17:07.502
MANUEL:
We gave up everything

17:07.503 --> 17:09.936
to be here.

17:09.939 --> 17:13.540
Now we don't have a...
a roof to stay?

17:13.542 --> 17:14.742
(baby crying)

17:14.743 --> 17:16.511
We got nothing.

17:17.780 --> 17:19.614
Manny, Manny, Manny, shh.

17:19.616 --> 17:21.648
We have everything.

17:21.651 --> 17:24.986
We have each other,
and we have our son.

17:24.988 --> 17:26.621
Shh.

17:26.623 --> 17:28.522
It's okay.
Shh. Shh, shh.

17:30.359 --> 17:32.460
We're gonna be okay.

17:39.868 --> 17:42.370
(elevator bell dings)

17:42.372 --> 17:43.938
Hey, what the hell's going on?

17:43.940 --> 17:46.307
I arrest a guy
for strangling his girlfriend,

17:46.309 --> 17:48.976
and beating the crap out of her,
and he gets RoR'd?

17:48.978 --> 17:51.045
First time offense, and
it's the judge's call.

17:51.047 --> 17:52.847
Well, the judge
is an idiot, because now,

17:52.849 --> 17:53.915
he's a second-time offender.

17:53.917 --> 17:55.683
He tried to run her
off the road last night.

17:55.685 --> 17:57.118
Did she I.D. him?

17:57.120 --> 17:58.553
We know it was him, okay?

17:58.555 --> 18:00.421
No, you assume
it was him.

18:00.423 --> 18:02.223
What's it gonna take? Is he
gonna have to kill her

18:02.225 --> 18:03.357
before somebody wakes up?

18:03.359 --> 18:05.459
You know, he wanted to
file a cross complaint.

18:05.461 --> 18:06.527
For what?

18:06.529 --> 18:09.263
He had a lump on the side
of his head.

18:09.265 --> 18:12.867
He probably got the lump
when I cuffed him, okay?

18:12.869 --> 18:14.268
That's just great.

18:14.270 --> 18:16.604
Look, she's a nurse, and
she's scared out of her wits,

18:16.606 --> 18:18.806
and he's attacked her
twice already.

18:18.808 --> 18:22.076
Danny, she's a nurse,
in jeopardy,

18:22.078 --> 18:24.078
looking to you for help.

18:24.080 --> 18:27.014
What are you trying to say?

18:27.016 --> 18:28.249
I just think the case

18:28.251 --> 18:30.952
is affecting you
on a personal level.

18:30.954 --> 18:32.854
It is personal.
It's my collar,

18:32.856 --> 18:34.555
and this jackass is
back on the street,

18:34.557 --> 18:37.124
assaulting his
girlfriend again,

18:37.126 --> 18:38.826
and nobody's helping me,
including you.

18:38.828 --> 18:41.929
I can't do anything if she can't
I.D. him as the attacker.

18:41.931 --> 18:43.097
Who else could it be?

18:43.099 --> 18:44.732
Get me a paint chip

18:44.734 --> 18:46.367
from her bumper
that matches his car,

18:46.369 --> 18:49.103
get me a video,
get me an eyewitness,

18:49.105 --> 18:52.740
get me something--
anything substantial.

18:52.742 --> 18:54.308
Mm-hmm.

18:54.310 --> 18:56.777
Well, hopefully,
it won't be a dead body.

19:01.350 --> 19:03.417
First, it was
quality of life crimes,

19:03.419 --> 19:04.652
which is bad enough, but now,

19:04.654 --> 19:06.020
violent offenders
getting cut loose?

19:06.022 --> 19:07.488
I mean, what are
we gonna do next?

19:07.490 --> 19:10.358
Release David Berkowitz
and Mark David Chapman?

19:10.360 --> 19:11.626
ERIN: You're really
going to equate

19:11.628 --> 19:14.495
your first-time offender
to the Son of Sam?

19:14.497 --> 19:15.663
You know what I mean.

19:15.665 --> 19:17.665
Now, look, if you
think it's insane

19:17.667 --> 19:20.401
that violent offenders are being
set free, raise your hand.

19:23.438 --> 19:26.474
See, there? And you get a
pass, 'cause she's your mom.

19:26.476 --> 19:28.175
NICKY: I don't need a
free pass, Uncle Danny.

19:28.177 --> 19:30.811
I'm sure her office
just followed the law.

19:30.813 --> 19:32.346
Oh, yeah, I'm sure
they were, too.

19:32.348 --> 19:33.648
What about you, Dad?

19:33.650 --> 19:37.518
Way too broad a question
for a yes or no from me.

19:37.520 --> 19:39.287
ERIN: You know what I
think would be great?

19:39.289 --> 19:40.922
If you could be a
prosecutor for a week.

19:40.924 --> 19:44.091
Yeah, I'd put all the bad guys
away, so it <i>would</i> be great.

19:44.093 --> 19:46.594
It would be great if we were
in Deadwood, South Dakota,

19:46.596 --> 19:47.929
around 1870.

19:47.931 --> 19:50.064
HENRY: In some ways,
too bad we're not.

19:50.066 --> 19:51.332
I'm with Danny.

19:51.334 --> 19:54.468
What some people call progress,
I call folly.

19:54.470 --> 19:55.369
Thank you.
Oh.

19:55.371 --> 19:56.370
Come on, Pop.

19:56.372 --> 19:58.239
No, I mean it.
Across the board?

19:58.241 --> 20:00.174
The rights of
law-abiding citizens

20:00.176 --> 20:02.009
trump the rights
of violent felons,

20:02.011 --> 20:05.880
across the board,
and all day long, yes.

20:05.882 --> 20:08.716
Thank you. I wish you
could be a cop for a week.

20:08.718 --> 20:10.117
ERIN:
I bet you wouldn't,

20:10.119 --> 20:11.252
because I would point out

20:11.254 --> 20:13.220
that everyone has rights,
including felons.

20:13.222 --> 20:15.690
Well, you wouldn't have to,
because cops already know that.

20:15.692 --> 20:16.724
HENRY:
Yeah.

20:16.726 --> 20:17.992
Right?

20:17.994 --> 20:21.562
That is far too broad a question
for a yes or no from me.

20:21.564 --> 20:22.697
(Henry laughs)

20:22.699 --> 20:23.898
NICKY:
Isn't the law

20:23.900 --> 20:25.466
supposed to be blind?

20:25.468 --> 20:27.435
Yeah, but not deaf
and dumb, too.

20:27.437 --> 20:28.602
All right.

20:28.604 --> 20:29.904
What is that
supposed to mean?

20:29.906 --> 20:31.505
Just that carrying this thing
to extremes

20:31.507 --> 20:33.207
is its own kind of lawlessness.

20:33.209 --> 20:35.009
FRANK: Well, the people
around this table,

20:35.011 --> 20:37.578
the beat cop, the detective,
the lawyer, the PC,

20:37.580 --> 20:39.146
we're the ones who are supposed

20:39.148 --> 20:40.514
to make sure
that doesn't happen.

20:40.516 --> 20:42.917
I think you all need
a flaming liberal in the mix.

20:42.919 --> 20:44.018
Keep you all honest.

20:44.020 --> 20:45.353
DANNY: I think we
already have one.

20:45.355 --> 20:47.421
And it's you,
so clam up.

20:47.423 --> 20:48.489
No, wait a minute.

20:48.491 --> 20:50.658
Nicky actually
has a point for a change.

20:50.660 --> 20:52.860
Thank you, I think.

20:52.862 --> 20:54.495
It is our job
to listen to people

20:54.497 --> 20:57.465
we don't have
an everyday connection to.

20:57.467 --> 20:58.933
JAMIE: Even if doing so
makes you doubt

20:58.935 --> 21:00.234
the wisdom of some laws.

21:00.236 --> 21:01.235
Yeah.

21:01.237 --> 21:02.737
No.
JAMIE: Yes.

21:02.739 --> 21:03.971
We delivered a baby Friday.

21:03.973 --> 21:06.173
The mother and the husband
are-are illegal.

21:06.175 --> 21:08.743
They both work, but they just
lost their apartment.

21:08.745 --> 21:09.977
Now they have
to move into a shelter,

21:09.979 --> 21:11.479
and there's nothing
I can do to help them.

21:11.481 --> 21:14.015
But didn't they break the law
by coming here illegally?

21:14.017 --> 21:15.616
Yes, they did.

21:15.618 --> 21:18.019
But the sentence
does not fit the crime.

21:18.021 --> 21:19.320
Not even close.

21:19.322 --> 21:21.622
I hope you find some way
to help them out.

21:21.624 --> 21:23.124
FRANK:
No, wait a minute.

21:23.126 --> 21:25.292
Aren't we burying
the headline here?

21:25.294 --> 21:27.528
Jamie Reagan delivered a baby.

21:27.530 --> 21:28.629
(laughter)
Yeah.

21:28.631 --> 21:30.464
Eight pounds, six ounces, yeah.

21:30.466 --> 21:31.766
What was it like?

21:31.768 --> 21:33.834
Uh, scary, and beautiful.

21:33.836 --> 21:36.070
And one of the most amazing
experiences of my life,

21:36.072 --> 21:40.875
but... the takeaway was,
I hope this kid has a shot.

21:42.377 --> 21:44.412
Hope the law doesn't get him.

21:44.414 --> 21:46.714
You know, that's coming
from a cop.

21:54.990 --> 21:56.457
Again?

21:56.459 --> 21:58.893
(laughs)
Double or nothing.

21:58.895 --> 22:00.895
Well, okay.

22:02.005 --> 22:03.472
How's Nicky doing?

22:03.474 --> 22:05.374
Oh, she's trying to win back

22:05.376 --> 22:08.844
a hypothetical $480
that she lost to Pop.

22:08.846 --> 22:11.447
Well, he's always been streaky.
She should stick to her game.

22:11.449 --> 22:12.982
Hmm.

22:12.984 --> 22:15.951
I got a hypothetical.

22:15.953 --> 22:17.419
Well, whatever it is,

22:17.421 --> 22:20.022
you don't have to dress it up
as a hypothetical.

22:20.024 --> 22:22.257
Why not?
Because there's not much

22:22.259 --> 22:25.728
that I haven't seen firsthand,
and I can take it straight-up.

22:25.730 --> 22:28.197
Okay. Let's say
someone gets arrested.

22:28.199 --> 22:30.099
"Someone"?

22:30.101 --> 22:32.868
A visitor to Rikers for
resisting a correction officer

22:32.870 --> 22:34.003
and then acting out.

22:34.005 --> 22:36.238
Does this someone have
a previous record?

22:36.240 --> 22:39.041
Similar offense
a few months ago.

22:39.043 --> 22:41.210
Can she go to jail for it?

22:41.212 --> 22:43.812
Ah, "she."
Someone's a she.

22:43.814 --> 22:46.148
Yeah, so what?

22:46.150 --> 22:48.250
Hence the hypothetical.

22:48.252 --> 22:49.785
No.

22:49.787 --> 22:52.454
What's the worst
that can happen to her?

22:52.456 --> 22:55.024
Well, a lot's gonna
depend on the judge

22:55.026 --> 22:57.526
and what the
C.O.s testify to.

22:57.528 --> 22:59.028
How big is their
beef with her?

22:59.030 --> 23:03.565
She could get bail
that she cannot make

23:03.567 --> 23:05.768
and end up
incarcerated at Rikers

23:05.770 --> 23:08.170
with those C.O.s
walking her hall

23:08.172 --> 23:12.241
for anywhere between six months
and two years awaiting trial.

23:12.243 --> 23:13.909
This a friend of yours?

23:13.911 --> 23:15.844
(sighs) Not exactly.

23:15.846 --> 23:17.713
Then what?

23:17.715 --> 23:20.683
One of those people
we talked about at dinner,

23:20.685 --> 23:22.951
the in-betweens.

23:22.953 --> 23:25.654
Well, if she keeps this up,

23:25.656 --> 23:29.458
she's gonna find herself between
a rock and a hard place.

23:31.327 --> 23:33.529
(sighs)

23:33.531 --> 23:35.898
You're never gonna guess
what I just did.

23:35.900 --> 23:37.800
Probably not,
but you're gonna tell me.

23:37.802 --> 23:39.702
I got Mr. Alvarez
a job as a super,

23:39.704 --> 23:41.103
and it comes with an apartment.

23:41.105 --> 23:43.172
Where? How?
This building in the Bronx.

23:43.174 --> 23:45.107
You know, one of those
hippy-dippy neighborhoods

23:45.109 --> 23:46.975
that's starting to gentrify
out by Yankee Stadium?

23:46.977 --> 23:48.444
How'd you swing that?

23:50.046 --> 23:51.647
What, now you don't talk?

23:51.649 --> 23:54.950
You know how my dad had
that whole Ponzi scheme going

23:54.952 --> 23:57.519
before he was finally
arrested for fraud?

23:57.521 --> 23:59.021
Yeah.

23:59.023 --> 24:00.422
Well, a couple
of the investors got out

24:00.424 --> 24:02.291
right before
the whole thing went bust.

24:02.293 --> 24:04.660
And one of them is
a real estate investor.

24:04.662 --> 24:06.261
So, what? You threatened him?

24:06.263 --> 24:09.665
No, but I laid a guilt trip
on him you wouldn't believe.

24:09.667 --> 24:12.067
There is one little hitch.

24:12.069 --> 24:13.335
A hitch?

24:13.337 --> 24:14.807
It's more like an
inconvenience for us.

24:14.831 --> 24:16.172
For us?

24:16.173 --> 24:18.540
I had to sweeten the deal.

24:20.376 --> 24:22.945
Eddie, what are you
talking about?

24:22.947 --> 24:24.279
Don't worry about it.

24:24.281 --> 24:26.548
What's the hitch?

24:26.550 --> 24:27.549
<i>(knock on door)</i>

24:27.551 --> 24:29.818
Raymond, open up.

24:29.820 --> 24:31.186
How many times are
you gonna come here?

24:31.188 --> 24:32.888
- I told you, I haven't seen him.
- Can you step back?

24:32.890 --> 24:34.189
When's the last
time you saw him?

24:34.191 --> 24:35.424
Yesterday.

24:35.426 --> 24:37.426
(sniffs)

24:37.428 --> 24:39.661
Do you smell that?

24:41.498 --> 24:43.499
Yeah, I do. It smells like gas.

24:43.501 --> 24:44.566
Really?

24:44.568 --> 24:46.101
Yeah.

24:46.103 --> 24:48.170
(sniffs)
I don't smell it.

24:48.172 --> 24:50.439
Well, you must be used to it,
'cause I smell it

24:50.441 --> 24:52.374
and it smells like
it's coming from in there.

24:52.376 --> 24:54.109
You think Raymond
left the gas on?

24:54.111 --> 24:56.011
If Raymond left the gas on
and he's inside,

24:56.013 --> 24:58.080
he could be in serious danger.

24:58.082 --> 25:00.916
(sniffs) Maybe you're right.
I think I do smell it.

25:04.420 --> 25:06.221
DANNY:
Okay, step back.

25:07.457 --> 25:10.292
Police. Raymond?

25:10.294 --> 25:12.427
Ray? Buddy? Hello?

25:12.429 --> 25:13.562
It's clear.

25:13.564 --> 25:14.596
Clear here.

25:14.598 --> 25:15.697
SUPER:
I'll check the stove.

25:15.699 --> 25:18.634
Go ahead.

25:18.636 --> 25:22.571
He bought enough ammo to do
some serious damage, too.

25:22.573 --> 25:25.107
He was Googling street views
and walkways of St. Irene's.

25:25.109 --> 25:27.376
Call crime scene.

25:27.378 --> 25:29.344
Lock this place down
till they get here.

25:29.346 --> 25:30.679
Where the hell are you going?

25:30.681 --> 25:32.181
I'm going to the hospital.
Have ESU meet me there.

25:32.183 --> 25:34.850
Danny, wait!
You, get the hell out! Get out!

25:34.852 --> 25:37.352
(phone ringing)

25:37.354 --> 25:39.154
St. Irene's.
DANNY: This is Detective Reagan,

25:39.156 --> 25:41.757
NYPD. Is Faith Madson
working today?

25:41.759 --> 25:42.925
Uh, yes, she is.

25:44.427 --> 25:46.094
H-Hey, Raymond.

25:46.096 --> 25:47.129
Is Faith here?

25:47.131 --> 25:48.964
Please, hold.
DANNY: No, no.

25:48.966 --> 25:50.432
Don't put me on hold!

25:50.434 --> 25:52.067
You know you can't see her.

25:52.069 --> 25:54.203
Don't tell him she's there.
Don't tell him!

25:54.205 --> 25:56.104
She's working, Ray.

25:56.106 --> 25:57.806
No, where-where is Faith?

25:57.808 --> 26:00.242
I'll let her know
you stopped by.

26:00.244 --> 26:02.477
Listen to me,
that guy has a gun! Okay?

26:03.613 --> 26:05.380
Where is Faith?

26:05.382 --> 26:06.982
MAN:
Someone call security.

26:06.984 --> 26:08.483
Raymond, Raymond, Ray.

26:08.485 --> 26:10.152
Where is she?

26:10.154 --> 26:11.486
Where is Faith?!

26:11.488 --> 26:13.455
- No!
- Where is Faith Madson?!

26:13.457 --> 26:15.357
Please, just take a breath.
Please. No. No.

26:15.359 --> 26:17.759
(siren wailing)

26:17.761 --> 26:19.661
- Tell me where she is. Where is she?
- You don't have to do this.

26:19.663 --> 26:21.630
Tell me.

26:21.632 --> 26:22.931
Don't. No, no.
I-I...

26:24.367 --> 26:26.201
(people screaming)

26:27.871 --> 26:29.671
(siren wailing)

26:31.140 --> 26:32.507
(crying)

26:33.543 --> 26:36.511
Faith! Faith!

26:36.513 --> 26:38.447
Where's Faith Madson?!

26:47.905 --> 26:50.574
(siren wailing,
people clamoring)

26:51.909 --> 26:52.339
What do we got?

26:52.363 --> 26:54.045
We've got reports of
shots fired from inside.

26:54.046 --> 26:56.746
Come on, get away
from the building!

26:56.748 --> 26:59.015
Get away! What do we got?

26:59.017 --> 27:00.090
We got one dead and
one circling the drain.

27:00.114 --> 27:01.219
Which way'd he go?

27:01.220 --> 27:02.953
911 calls say from
the fifth floor.

27:02.955 --> 27:04.121
All right. Hang in there.

27:04.123 --> 27:05.188
Where you going?
Move!

27:05.190 --> 27:06.490
ESU's two minutes out!

27:06.492 --> 27:07.891
Ain't got time.
It's an active shooter!

27:07.893 --> 27:09.192
Where's the stairwell?

27:09.194 --> 27:11.728
Over there!
Over there!

27:11.730 --> 27:13.663
Let's go!

27:15.500 --> 27:16.500
(door slams)

27:16.502 --> 27:18.301
Staff, staff!

27:18.303 --> 27:20.704
Police. Get the hell
out of here.

27:28.913 --> 27:30.947
(woman whimpers)

27:34.552 --> 27:35.852
(man whispering)

27:35.854 --> 27:37.154
He still back there?

27:37.156 --> 27:38.555
No, he left.

27:38.557 --> 27:41.057
Which way'd he go?

27:41.059 --> 27:42.092
I don't know.

27:42.094 --> 27:44.327
Where's Faith Madson?

27:44.329 --> 27:46.463
I don't know. Why?
Because where she is, he is.

27:46.465 --> 27:48.665
Stay there.
Help's on the way.

27:48.667 --> 27:51.368
Give me your hand,
give me your hand. Come on.

27:51.370 --> 27:52.569
(man groaning)

27:54.639 --> 27:55.906
Stay here.

27:57.108 --> 27:59.576
(woman sobbing)

27:59.578 --> 28:01.211
Hey. Which way'd he go?

28:01.213 --> 28:02.846
I didn't see.

28:04.148 --> 28:07.083
(gunshots)

28:07.085 --> 28:08.718
He's downstairs. Stay put.

28:11.622 --> 28:14.224
Where is Faith Madson?!

28:15.660 --> 28:17.727
I'm gonna keep shooting

28:17.729 --> 28:20.030
until I find her!
(stifled sobbing)

28:21.032 --> 28:23.099
Faith!

28:23.868 --> 28:25.869
Faith!

28:29.874 --> 28:32.075
Faith!

28:38.216 --> 28:40.750
Hey, take the stairs.
Get out of here.

28:40.752 --> 28:42.586
Where is she?

28:42.588 --> 28:43.887
I don't know.

28:44.889 --> 28:46.122
Where is Nurse Madson?

28:46.124 --> 28:47.757
Just let us be, okay?

28:47.759 --> 28:50.460
I don't know where she is.

28:50.462 --> 28:52.128
(whispering):
You're okay, you're okay.

28:52.130 --> 28:54.364
Faith! Come on.

28:57.501 --> 28:59.402
Run, run, run, run, run!

28:59.404 --> 29:01.238
No!

29:01.240 --> 29:02.272
Get back!

29:02.274 --> 29:04.040
Go!

29:04.042 --> 29:05.308
(panting)

29:05.310 --> 29:06.276
Hey! Don't do it!

29:06.278 --> 29:07.477
Get back!

29:07.479 --> 29:08.878
Ray, don't hurt her.

29:08.880 --> 29:10.747
She hurt me, but no-no one
cares about that?

29:10.749 --> 29:12.429
Raymond, please, just
listen to him. I'm sorry.

29:12.430 --> 29:14.752
- Shut up.
- Ray! Hey!

29:14.753 --> 29:16.820
Let's talk. Okay?

29:16.822 --> 29:18.688
You kill me,
you kill her!

29:18.690 --> 29:19.589
I don't want to kill you.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.925
I want to help
you, okay?

29:21.927 --> 29:23.460
Please, listen to him.
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

29:23.462 --> 29:25.929
Shut up, shut up, shut up.
DANNY: Ray! Hey!

29:25.931 --> 29:28.331
Forget about her. Look at me.

29:28.333 --> 29:29.733
Look at me.

29:29.735 --> 29:32.569
Let's work this out together,
just me and you. Come on.

29:32.571 --> 29:34.437
I want people to know
what she did.

29:34.439 --> 29:36.506
Whoa, oh!

29:36.508 --> 29:37.741
Don't come closer!

29:37.743 --> 29:38.975
Hey!

29:38.977 --> 29:40.076
Get back!

29:40.078 --> 29:41.111
Stand back!

29:41.113 --> 29:42.245
RAYMOND:
You don't love me.

29:42.247 --> 29:43.747
You... this-this is your fault.
Please.

29:43.749 --> 29:45.015
RAYMOND:
This is your fault.

29:45.017 --> 29:46.516
Okay, Ray.
Just threw it all away

29:46.518 --> 29:48.585
for no reason, no reason!

29:48.587 --> 29:51.488
I want everybody to know
that she ripped out my heart.

29:51.490 --> 29:54.257
That I, that I gave her
everything and she just,

29:54.259 --> 29:56.159
she just threw it
all away. No reason!

29:56.161 --> 29:58.595
Ray.
She just threw it all away.

29:58.597 --> 30:00.697
(cries)
I'm sorry.

30:00.699 --> 30:02.032
I'm sorry.
DANNY: Ray.

30:02.034 --> 30:03.199
Talk to me.

30:03.201 --> 30:05.835
I want everybody to know
that I have no regrets

30:05.837 --> 30:07.203
about what I'm about to do.

30:07.205 --> 30:09.706
Raymond, please
put the gun down.

30:09.708 --> 30:11.641
RAYMOND:
If you take that shot,

30:11.643 --> 30:14.511
you miss, you have
to live with it.

30:15.646 --> 30:17.013
(shouts)

30:22.620 --> 30:24.821
(panting)

30:32.463 --> 30:35.532
Come on, come on.

30:35.534 --> 30:38.168
(crying)

30:53.851 --> 30:55.919
(door opens)
BAKER: Sir?

30:55.921 --> 30:57.587
Let's have her.

30:57.589 --> 30:59.622
(sighs)

30:59.624 --> 31:01.558
I know what
you're gonna say.

31:01.560 --> 31:02.592
No, you don't.

31:02.594 --> 31:04.494
I should have
edited myself.

31:04.496 --> 31:06.096
"The NYPD is corrupt"?

31:06.098 --> 31:09.065
"The NYPD is complicit
in covering up a murder"?

31:09.067 --> 31:10.700
What editing undoes that?

31:10.702 --> 31:12.068
I hadn't heard back from you.

31:12.070 --> 31:14.070
I didn't know I
had a clock on me.

31:14.072 --> 31:16.373
If you're me, you don't get
to use the microphone too often.

31:16.375 --> 31:19.576
Well, then learn how to use it
or run away from it.

31:21.379 --> 31:24.514
Oh. Come on.

31:26.350 --> 31:28.551
Please, sit down.

31:34.024 --> 31:36.426
I don't have PR guys

31:36.428 --> 31:39.662
to go between my raw thoughts
and the polite ones.

31:39.664 --> 31:42.432
Look, you're smart.
You called into that radio...

31:42.434 --> 31:44.768
You never said things before
in a moment that you wish

31:44.770 --> 31:45.902
you could take back?
Sure.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.637
Then just take
my word for it.

31:47.639 --> 31:48.972
That's exactly the problem.

31:48.974 --> 31:50.440
I mean now!

31:50.442 --> 31:51.908
I got carried away.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.410
I'm sorry.

31:53.412 --> 31:55.512
But sometimes,
I have to make a little noise

31:55.514 --> 31:56.613
to make things happen.

31:56.615 --> 31:59.816
Is everything an agenda
with you?

31:59.818 --> 32:02.719
Saying what I believe
is not an agenda.

32:02.721 --> 32:04.888
What do you expect from me?

32:04.890 --> 32:07.757
I expect your trust.
I think I've earned that.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.125
Why?

32:09.127 --> 32:12.061
Because you show up
to some of our vigils sometimes?

32:12.063 --> 32:16.266
I appreciate you
showing up,

32:16.268 --> 32:19.836
but you never contribute.

32:20.905 --> 32:23.406
I guess I never felt
I had anything to offer.

32:23.408 --> 32:24.808
Just you standing
up there

32:24.810 --> 32:26.142
and saying the system
isn't perfect,

32:26.144 --> 32:29.078
that some folks
get screwed by it?

32:29.080 --> 32:31.581
That would be like
Christmas morning to us.

32:33.451 --> 32:37.854
Shelly, as sure as
we are sitting here,

32:37.856 --> 32:40.089
you're gonna end up
in the system.

32:40.091 --> 32:42.091
I don't want to see that.

32:42.093 --> 32:44.828
You sit up here above it all.

32:44.830 --> 32:47.664
You have no idea what it's like

32:47.666 --> 32:50.400
to fight an unjust system...

32:50.402 --> 32:54.771
to lose your brothers
and sisters and children!

32:57.641 --> 33:01.911
Sometimes, you just
showing up isn't enough.

33:01.913 --> 33:05.515
You've got to put
some skin in the game!

33:23.387 --> 33:25.778
(sighs)

33:31.365 --> 33:32.698
Detective?

33:33.300 --> 33:35.434
Hi.

33:35.436 --> 33:37.157
I wasn't expecting you.

33:37.158 --> 33:38.958
Yeah, I was, um...
I was pretty wound up,

33:38.960 --> 33:41.427
so I just went for
a walk, and then I was

33:41.429 --> 33:43.395
walking for an hour,
and I ended up here.

33:43.397 --> 33:46.665
Well, it is a very
safe place to end up.

33:48.301 --> 33:50.736
- Is that your wife?
- Yeah.

33:50.738 --> 33:51.937
She's pretty.

33:51.939 --> 33:52.871
Thank you.

33:52.873 --> 33:54.606
You have a
beautiful family.

33:54.608 --> 33:55.941
Thanks.

33:57.544 --> 34:01.180
I wanted to thank you
for everything.

34:01.182 --> 34:04.049
You, you really...

34:04.051 --> 34:05.718
you saved my life.

34:05.720 --> 34:07.186
I just did my job.

34:07.188 --> 34:09.321
I kind of get the feeling
you're the kind of guy

34:09.322 --> 34:10.889
who never just
does his job.

34:10.891 --> 34:12.591
Guilty as charged.

34:12.592 --> 34:14.059
(chuckles)

34:14.061 --> 34:16.929
I didn't just end up here,
I came here with a purpose.

34:16.931 --> 34:19.098
Okay.

34:19.100 --> 34:21.065
I'd like to see you again.

34:21.068 --> 34:22.868
Outside of work.

34:22.870 --> 34:24.803
I mean, maybe I could,
I could take you to dinner,

34:24.804 --> 34:26.237
a movie or something.

34:28.742 --> 34:30.809
Yeah, I'm sorry.
That was, that was...

34:30.811 --> 34:31.877
No...

34:31.879 --> 34:33.846
No, it was inappropriate.
I get it.

34:33.848 --> 34:35.981
It's okay.

34:35.983 --> 34:37.449
Um...

34:37.451 --> 34:40.485
it's not that I don't
find you interesting

34:40.487 --> 34:45.357
or beautiful or... funny.

34:45.359 --> 34:47.159
Just think maybe

34:47.161 --> 34:49.661
in another lifetime,
when I'm a little bit better

34:49.663 --> 34:54.233
at dealing with certain things,
I'd probably jump at the chance.

34:56.870 --> 34:59.204
It's too soon.
I totally get it.

34:59.206 --> 35:02.508
It's weird, but, uh...

35:02.510 --> 35:04.610
I still feel like
I'm married, you know?

35:04.612 --> 35:06.745
Yeah.

35:06.747 --> 35:08.614
I did, too, for a long time.

35:08.616 --> 35:11.617
When does it stop?

35:13.486 --> 35:14.987
Feeling like you're married.

35:14.989 --> 35:17.189
Uh...

35:17.191 --> 35:21.593
when you decide it's okay
to start living again.

35:24.497 --> 35:26.765
Your wife was lucky.

35:28.234 --> 35:30.469
So was I.

35:32.472 --> 35:34.740
♪

35:49.923 --> 35:52.758
Okay, do you want to know
what the hitch is?

35:52.760 --> 35:55.327
Yeah. What's the hitch?

35:55.329 --> 35:57.796
I may have promised
that we'd work security

35:57.798 --> 35:59.398
at a Hamptons bash
next month.

35:59.400 --> 36:01.667
Are you serious?
It's gonna be great.

36:01.669 --> 36:03.268
The family won't have
to live in a...

36:03.270 --> 36:05.370
in a shelter,
and all you have to do is

36:05.372 --> 36:07.706
keep fans away from Jay-Z
for a couple weekends.

36:07.708 --> 36:09.241
Win-win.
A couple?!

36:09.243 --> 36:11.610
ANGELA:
There you are!

36:11.612 --> 36:12.611
Hey, hey, guys.

36:12.613 --> 36:13.779
Hey.

36:13.781 --> 36:15.848
Hey.
We don't know how to thank you.

36:15.850 --> 36:18.817
A... a job as a super?

36:18.819 --> 36:20.085
An apartment of our own?

36:20.087 --> 36:21.920
Um, we are so--

36:21.922 --> 36:24.423
what's the word--
overcome...

36:24.425 --> 36:26.458
with thanks to both of you.

36:26.460 --> 36:28.660
Well, we're just so glad
everything worked out.

36:28.662 --> 36:31.630
You have no idea how
much this means to us.

36:31.632 --> 36:32.998
Everything you've done.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.900
Um, we can't
thank you enough.

36:34.902 --> 36:37.536
Please, just take care of
this beautiful family of yours.

36:37.538 --> 36:38.670
That's thanks enough.

36:38.672 --> 36:40.506
Well, we couldn't think
what to give you

36:40.508 --> 36:43.709
to show you how grateful we are
for everything you've done.

36:43.711 --> 36:48.080
So, um, we named
the baby after you.

36:48.082 --> 36:50.015
(Angela and Manuel chuckle)

36:50.017 --> 36:51.416
Oh, you named
the baby Jamie?

36:51.418 --> 36:52.885
Eddie.
Yeah, Eddie.

36:52.887 --> 36:53.919
(both laugh)

36:53.921 --> 36:55.487
Yeah, Eddie.

36:55.489 --> 36:56.922
Just like you.
Yeah.

36:56.924 --> 37:00.125
Oh, uh, wow, I'm, uh,

37:00.127 --> 37:01.493
touched.

37:01.495 --> 37:03.729
I, um... I'm really...

37:03.731 --> 37:05.864
Wow, that's something,
right, Jamie?

37:05.866 --> 37:08.767
Y-Yes. Thank you so much.

37:08.769 --> 37:11.270
This really is
so beautiful.

37:11.272 --> 37:13.372
We are just so happy.

37:14.674 --> 37:16.608
Thank you.
Say bye-bye, Eddie.

37:16.610 --> 37:17.776
Congratulations.

37:17.778 --> 37:19.745
Adios, Eddie.
Bye-bye.

37:19.747 --> 37:21.046
All right, adios, Eddie.

37:21.048 --> 37:22.414
(Angela and Manuel chuckle)

37:25.318 --> 37:26.985
Come on, Eddie.

37:31.324 --> 37:33.959
Perfect. Give it a try.

37:33.961 --> 37:35.494
All right, let's test this out.

37:35.496 --> 37:37.229
Oh, no. Oh!

37:37.231 --> 37:38.931
Oh, my God. Luck.

37:38.933 --> 37:40.499
Oh, it's all skill.
Yeah.

37:40.501 --> 37:41.433
What's going on?

37:41.435 --> 37:42.734
Hey, guys.

37:42.736 --> 37:44.636
I'll tell you what's
going on here.

37:44.638 --> 37:46.505
I may not have some
of your mother's skills,

37:46.507 --> 37:48.073
but I can build
a regulation

37:48.075 --> 37:49.675
basketball hoop
with my bare hands,

37:49.677 --> 37:52.010
and I didn't even need
to read the manual.

37:52.012 --> 37:53.946
Because I read the instructions.

37:53.948 --> 37:56.448
Because you know nothing
about basketball.

37:56.450 --> 37:58.183
Ooh.
I know how to beat you.

37:58.185 --> 37:59.851
Those are fightin' words.

37:59.853 --> 38:01.353
Those are fightin' words.
You in?

38:01.355 --> 38:03.222
I'm in.
How 'bout you?

38:03.224 --> 38:04.189
Done. Team Erin.

38:04.191 --> 38:05.824
All right, two on two.
Let's go.

38:05.826 --> 38:06.858
You're a girl.
That makes it

38:06.860 --> 38:09.861
one and a half on two.
Oh, right. Okay.

38:09.863 --> 38:11.830
Oh!
Oh! Let's go.

38:11.832 --> 38:13.999
Winners can't let it up
like that, Dad.

38:14.001 --> 38:16.435
All right, all right.
Now we got a game, let's go.

38:18.104 --> 38:20.172
Oh!
Let's go.

38:22.609 --> 38:25.277
That old saying...

38:25.279 --> 38:28.380
"You can only be as happy

38:28.382 --> 38:30.215
as your least happy child..."

38:30.217 --> 38:32.751
I need to find
an antidote for that.

38:32.753 --> 38:34.987
(laughs)
That's why I'm here.

38:34.989 --> 38:36.355
My daughter can't hardly
get out of bed

38:36.357 --> 38:37.756
since her boy was killed.

38:37.758 --> 38:40.292
That's why I'm here.

38:42.695 --> 38:43.762
(sighs)

38:43.764 --> 38:46.431
With the hope that...

38:46.433 --> 38:50.302
by me telling our story...

38:50.304 --> 38:54.273
maybe some kind of relief
will rub off on her.

38:54.275 --> 38:55.974
Thank you.

38:59.612 --> 39:02.614
Thank you for that, Doris.

39:02.616 --> 39:05.684
Would anyone else like to speak?

39:07.153 --> 39:09.554
Commissioner Reagan?

39:14.193 --> 39:17.529
Maybe you'd like
to say something?

39:17.531 --> 39:19.798
♪

39:34.847 --> 39:35.881
Hello.

39:35.883 --> 39:37.849
CROWD:
Hello.

39:42.555 --> 39:44.589
(sighs)

39:47.260 --> 39:48.827
Okay.

39:50.596 --> 39:54.166
When, uh, my oldest son
was nine,

39:54.168 --> 39:57.469
he got into it
with his, uh, younger brother

39:57.471 --> 39:58.737
in the backyard.

39:58.739 --> 40:00.005
They were 19 months apart,

40:00.007 --> 40:04.443
so it wasn't
an uncommon occurrence.

40:04.445 --> 40:06.611
Their grandpa breaks it up,

40:06.613 --> 40:09.481
but then he's asked them
to settle it

40:09.483 --> 40:12.617
in what he called the right way.

40:12.619 --> 40:13.719
(chuckles)

40:13.721 --> 40:17.022
Sure enough,
out of the garage comes Pop.

40:17.024 --> 40:19.658
He was a former department
boxing champ,

40:19.660 --> 40:21.226
and he's got the gloves.

40:21.228 --> 40:25.530
So... to be honest,
I know that 12-ounce gloves

40:25.532 --> 40:28.700
are pretty cumbersome
on a kid.

40:28.702 --> 40:31.636
They're not gonna do
much damage to each other.

40:31.638 --> 40:32.871
I knew their mother
wouldn't approve,

40:32.873 --> 40:35.540
but she was at the market
with the baby.

40:35.542 --> 40:40.645
So the brothers went at it
in the Reagan backyard

40:40.647 --> 40:43.782
with Grandpa as the referee.

40:43.784 --> 40:45.484
(crowd chuckling)

40:45.486 --> 40:48.019
Now, personally,
I think big brother

40:48.021 --> 40:50.989
was going easy
on little brother.

40:50.991 --> 40:55.627
But little brother,
he was having none of that.

40:55.629 --> 40:58.630
I mean, Joe would...
he'd bop him one,

40:58.632 --> 41:02.701
and Danny would just
wade back in.

41:02.703 --> 41:05.937
Their kid sister,
by the way...

41:05.939 --> 41:07.506
(chuckles)

41:07.508 --> 41:09.174
...she was enjoying
the hell out of it

41:09.176 --> 41:13.678
because both of them
picked on her all the time.

41:13.680 --> 41:14.980
(crowd chuckling)

41:14.982 --> 41:17.582
Anyway, with those
big, heavy gloves,

41:17.584 --> 41:20.385
it didn't take long
for them to get arm-weary

41:20.387 --> 41:21.720
and punched out.

41:21.722 --> 41:25.690
Grandpa calls it a draw,
and that was that.

41:27.460 --> 41:30.762
Except... the next morning,

41:30.764 --> 41:34.099
I get a call
from Sister Margaret Mary,

41:34.101 --> 41:35.500
their school principal.

41:35.502 --> 41:39.204
She was inquiring about

41:39.206 --> 41:45.010
Joe's black eye
and Danny's split lip.

41:45.012 --> 41:49.414
Evidently, the brothers

41:49.416 --> 41:52.017
were not willing to talk.

41:53.753 --> 41:58.390
Between you and me,
made me proud.

41:58.392 --> 42:01.226
My sons were
protecting each other.

42:02.962 --> 42:05.831
And as for my oldest, Joe...

42:13.105 --> 42:15.740
...I miss him every day.

42:27.453 --> 42:31.089
It's funny,
the things you think about.
