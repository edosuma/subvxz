WEBVTT

00:00.859 --> 00:02.561
"Pony" by Ginuwine comes on,

00:02.628 --> 00:04.730
and Sam walks straight
to the middle of the room,

00:04.755 --> 00:06.400
clears a big circle,

00:06.466 --> 00:08.229
won't let anybody else dance...

00:08.254 --> 00:09.588
I drop down to the ground

00:09.654 --> 00:10.955
and start doing the worm.

00:11.022 --> 00:13.758
And boom! My pants split wide open.

00:13.825 --> 00:17.109
No underwear! Butt everywhere!

00:17.109 --> 00:18.830
Man, it was so bad,

00:18.897 --> 00:20.632
the principal had to give Sam his pants.

00:20.698 --> 00:22.467
I still have 'em.

00:22.534 --> 00:24.235
- You do?
- They fit! They fit!

00:27.405 --> 00:28.873
Well, I have a funny prom story.

00:28.940 --> 00:30.440
- Yes!
- Okay, okay.

00:30.479 --> 00:33.104
So our theme was Under the Sea.

00:33.344 --> 00:36.641
Except they put stars on the ceiling.

00:37.077 --> 00:39.204
Well why would there
be stars on the ceiling

00:39.204 --> 00:41.540
if we're under the sea?!

00:43.943 --> 00:45.211
Who does that, you know?

00:45.278 --> 00:46.479
Uh, yeah.

00:46.546 --> 00:47.714
I guess there wouldn't be...

00:47.781 --> 00:49.812
- No.
- Ha, ha!

00:49.991 --> 00:52.431
Ah, man, hilarious.

00:52.947 --> 00:55.282
Then I was voted prom
queen, so, you know, so dumb.

00:55.307 --> 00:58.466
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

00:58.900 --> 00:59.943
I love your hair.

00:59.968 --> 01:01.669
Oh, thank you.

01:01.736 --> 01:04.438
Yeah, Chrissy does YouTube hair tutorials.

01:04.504 --> 01:05.673
They're pretty popular.

01:05.740 --> 01:07.375
Oh, I love YouTube!

01:07.442 --> 01:09.363
Yeah, I have lots of videos on there

01:09.388 --> 01:11.290
of me singing gospel songs.

01:11.356 --> 01:12.958
So many views, it's embarrassing.

01:13.024 --> 01:14.493
- So dumb.
- Totally.

01:14.559 --> 01:15.660

Something like that kind of
is, like, can slip the mind.

02:09.011 --> 02:10.768
Sam, that's Molly.

02:10.835 --> 02:14.136
Is it, Chrissy? What a
fantastic memory you have.

You used to call her your soulmate.

Ex-girlfriend.

02:30.454 --> 02:33.038

03:10.294 --> 03:13.497

03:18.269 --> 03:20.498
The hell's that? Is that some kind of joke?

03:20.523 --> 03:21.742
Yeah, of course it's a joke.

03:21.767 --> 03:23.302
I think it's funnier than you do, actually.

03:23.469 --> 03:25.371
Well, Tim, I had this great idea.

03:25.438 --> 03:26.573
It's just... it kind of made me laugh.

03:26.639 --> 03:28.408
I was like, what if...

03:28.474 --> 03:31.411
Get this... we re-recorded
the Farmer Zack jingle

03:31.477 --> 03:33.009
with me and Shannon singing?

03:33.506 --> 03:34.422
Ugh.

03:34.578 --> 03:36.327
Shannon's jealous 'cause
it's you and Molly.

03:36.397 --> 03:38.762
No. Shannon didn't even mention it once.

03:39.118 --> 03:40.182
Yet.

03:40.182 --> 03:41.754
But man, it's so awkward, you know.

03:41.821 --> 03:42.922
It comes on all the time.

03:42.989 --> 03:44.157
So let's re-record it.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.196
Sam, people love that jingle.

03:46.196 --> 03:47.794
Yeah, but they'll love the new jingle

03:47.819 --> 03:48.906
even more.

03:48.947 --> 03:50.017
Plus,

03:50.017 --> 03:51.249
Shannon's a professional singer,

03:51.316 --> 03:52.317
she's my girlfriend,

03:52.384 --> 03:53.562
and we're doing it, so...

03:53.664 --> 03:54.985
Yeah, you know what? Fine.

03:55.320 --> 03:57.589
But it's only because I want
you and Shannon to be happy.

03:58.140 --> 03:59.167
Thank you, buddy.

03:59.192 --> 04:00.610
But tell me this, my friend...

04:03.595 --> 04:04.663
How's the sex?

04:04.730 --> 04:05.864
We don't have to do that.

04:05.931 --> 04:07.065
I'm sorry. I apologize.

04:07.132 --> 04:08.333
- It's a joke.
- Okay.

04:08.400 --> 04:09.668
- It's all part of the...
- I mean...

04:09.735 --> 04:10.768
Yeah.

04:11.636 --> 04:13.383
Crap, now I'm picturing you pumping.

04:14.490 --> 04:15.974
Now I'm picturing you pumping.

04:23.514 --> 04:25.117
<i>For the life of me,
I can't understand,</i>

04:25.183 --> 04:26.676
why would you steal Kotex?

04:27.140 --> 04:28.482
Do you even know what they are?

04:28.795 --> 04:29.857
Look at me!

04:30.061 --> 04:31.656
Do you know what my daddy
would do if he found me

04:31.723 --> 04:33.058
stealing some Kotex?

04:33.125 --> 04:35.293
He would beat my black ass.

04:35.360 --> 04:36.661
You better look at me. I ain't playin'.

04:36.728 --> 04:38.096
I'll put my foot so deep in your ass

04:38.163 --> 04:39.931
you'll be walking on my knees.

04:39.998 --> 04:41.533
Tomata, you're banned from the store.

04:41.600 --> 04:43.162
Now get your ass outta here!

04:44.830 --> 04:46.338
Better take that look off you...

04:46.405 --> 04:47.939
You take that look off your face.

04:48.006 --> 04:49.851
- You can't steal, buddy.
- Ooh! Sam!

04:50.554 --> 04:52.538
Hey, guys. What can I do you for?

04:53.022 --> 04:55.013
Randy, we think it's about time

04:55.080 --> 04:56.782
you update that commercial of yours.

04:56.848 --> 04:58.784
Are you crazy? People love that commercial.

04:59.244 --> 05:01.272
Yes, they love it. But it's outdated.

05:01.319 --> 05:02.754
Yeah, times are changing,

05:02.821 --> 05:04.656
and people want a grocery
store that changes with them.

05:04.723 --> 05:06.068
Let's walk! Tell me what
you're talking about.

05:06.093 --> 05:07.133
Let's walk, let's walk.

05:07.693 --> 05:09.161
You got to check, because
they be stealing the toys

05:09.227 --> 05:10.629
in here, you know what I'm sayin'?

05:10.696 --> 05:11.830
You put little ski masks in there,

05:11.897 --> 05:13.196
you know what I'm sayin'?

05:13.221 --> 05:14.866
Chocolate Duke, baby.
You can't...

05:14.933 --> 05:16.702
Yeah, well it's just Count Chocula.

05:16.768 --> 05:17.803
Hmm?

05:17.869 --> 05:19.268
Randy, we were thinking,

05:19.268 --> 05:22.360
for the new commercial, we
could update the song, uh,

05:22.385 --> 05:24.376
with different prices for the holidays,

05:24.401 --> 05:27.325
like, uh, "for the 4th of July,

05:27.350 --> 05:29.330
hot dogs are 2.99."

05:29.373 --> 05:31.264
That price just blew my mind..."

05:31.264 --> 05:32.326
Mike!

05:32.910 --> 05:34.444
Don't squeeze the melons like that, man,

05:34.511 --> 05:35.779
I can smell your fingers on it!

05:35.846 --> 05:37.047
I don't do that anymore.

05:37.114 --> 05:38.810
I'm lookin' at ya, man.

05:38.810 --> 05:40.288
No, I'm looking at 'em to buy.

05:41.018 --> 05:43.185
Oh, I'm sorry, man. My apologies, man.

05:43.185 --> 05:44.811
Tsunami of apologies to you.

05:45.956 --> 05:47.791
Okay, that's fine. You can update the song,

05:47.858 --> 05:50.671
but we gotta do something
with this goddamn character.

05:50.671 --> 05:52.062
- Yes.
- We gotta update him,

05:52.129 --> 05:53.363
you know what I'm sayin'?

05:53.388 --> 05:54.436
We need to get rid of this hat,

05:54.461 --> 05:56.234
give him some black shades, and a...

05:56.259 --> 05:58.068
Like a black shirt,
let his muscles pop out.

05:58.338 --> 06:01.284
You want Farmer Zack to lose the straw hat

06:01.284 --> 06:02.774
and have a tight black shirt?

06:03.674 --> 06:05.208
- That's it.
- Yeah.

06:05.275 --> 06:06.777
Yeah, we could do that, though.

06:06.843 --> 06:08.045
That's what I mean. Mike!

06:08.559 --> 06:09.813
What you doing, man?!

06:11.179 --> 06:13.312
- He just had his dick in a melon.
- Oh.

06:13.397 --> 06:15.097
He's got his dick in a melon!

06:16.353 --> 06:17.788
Oh, she's buying the dick melon.

06:17.854 --> 06:19.256
- She's buying the dick... ma'am!
- Ma'am!

06:19.323 --> 06:20.524
- Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am!
- Ma'am!

06:20.591 --> 06:21.658
A man had his penis in that.

06:21.725 --> 06:22.960
I'll get you a new one.

06:24.604 --> 06:26.042
_

06:26.067 --> 06:27.395
Mm-hmm.

06:28.472 --> 06:29.474
_

06:32.836 --> 06:34.872
- Oh, babe.
- Hm?

06:34.872 --> 06:36.873
- Got some exciting news.
- What?

06:37.026 --> 06:39.862
We just hired an amazing gospel singer

06:40.130 --> 06:43.079
to sing the new and improved
Farmer Zack's jingle.

06:45.708 --> 06:47.351
Is it that raggedy bitch Bebe Jenkins?

06:47.417 --> 06:49.853
Oh, no, babe, uh, it's...
I was talking about you.

06:49.920 --> 06:51.186
Just trying to be sweet. It's you.

06:51.186 --> 06:52.279
Oh, my God!

06:52.689 --> 06:55.359
Oh, my... that'll be so much fun.

06:55.928 --> 06:57.086
Babe, you're the cutest.

06:57.086 --> 06:58.309
Ah, actually I'm the sexiest.

06:58.309 --> 06:59.863
But yeah, we can re-record the jingle

06:59.930 --> 07:01.186
and never hear the old one again.

07:01.665 --> 07:03.634
Good. Because you acted so weird

07:03.700 --> 07:05.078
when it came on the other day.

07:06.003 --> 07:07.704
Sam, I'm not bothered

07:07.771 --> 07:10.501
by you and your ex being so sexual,

07:10.501 --> 07:11.488
'cause...

07:12.977 --> 07:14.512
we can be sexual, too.

07:14.570 --> 07:17.205
- Oh.
- And not just in the studios.

07:17.229 --> 07:18.236
Yeah.

07:19.401 --> 07:20.396
Goodnight.

07:21.955 --> 07:23.845
Hey, YouTubers, it's your girl

07:23.846 --> 07:25.198
Chrissy-Cross comin' at you

07:25.198 --> 07:26.507
with that new hotness...

07:26.894 --> 07:29.130
A natural hair up-do.

07:29.424 --> 07:31.466
Just follow the steps in this tutorial,

07:31.532 --> 07:33.501
put on a dress that shows off your figure,

07:33.568 --> 07:35.436
and get out of the house!

07:35.503 --> 07:36.753
Why are you talking like that?

07:36.754 --> 07:38.537
Dang it, Tim. Get out of the shot.

07:40.049 --> 07:42.127
Sam is gonna re-record
the Farmer Zack's jingle

07:42.193 --> 07:43.161
with Shannon.

07:43.228 --> 07:44.427
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

07:44.596 --> 07:46.394
Sam and Molly had such good chemistry

07:46.419 --> 07:47.614
in that song.

07:47.747 --> 07:49.834
- And no offense to Shannon...
- None taken.

07:49.901 --> 07:50.969
But it just won't be the same.

07:51.035 --> 07:52.237
- I know.
- I mean,

07:52.303 --> 07:53.638
she's a perfectly nice girl.

07:53.705 --> 07:55.406
- Perfectly nice.
- But you can tell

07:55.473 --> 07:57.262
when two people just
aren't right for each other,

07:57.315 --> 07:59.087
Yeah. When Sam's around her,

07:59.112 --> 08:00.845
he's completely lost his star factor.

08:01.495 --> 08:03.143
- What?
- His star factor.

08:03.168 --> 08:05.214
That special something
that makes you go from

08:05.239 --> 08:07.672
a face in the crowd to a face in lights.

08:08.372 --> 08:09.769
- You gonna tell him?
- No.

08:09.794 --> 08:11.356
I'm gonna pretend to be supportive.

08:11.871 --> 08:13.124
Good for you.

08:13.277 --> 08:15.317
Now get out of here. I'm making a tutorial.

people who watch your tutorials

08:29.434 --> 08:30.675
say about me.

08:30.929 --> 08:32.043
What is one?

08:33.885 --> 08:36.154
"When did Chucky grow up and get ugly?"

08:36.179 --> 08:38.313
Chucky grow up to get ugly?!

08:38.381 --> 08:40.376
Chucky's ugly as a boy!

08:40.376 --> 08:42.025
Bad logic. Next.

08:43.553 --> 08:45.257
"Look like the McRib is back."

08:45.454 --> 08:47.456
How am I a McRib?!

08:47.523 --> 08:50.226
I'm a man with a big old hog!

08:50.293 --> 08:52.495
Put that in the video! I... I don't care.

08:52.562 --> 08:55.131
Ha, ha, that's... I don't care.

10:22.325 --> 10:24.594
Yeah. About this farmer thing.

10:24.661 --> 10:26.429
Yeah, we gave him the tight black shirt,

10:26.496 --> 10:28.064
and we gave him the cool sunglasses.

10:28.514 --> 10:30.567

10:39.559 --> 10:41.004
Yeah, we can do all that.

10:41.029 --> 10:42.068
Thanks, guys.

10:42.529 --> 10:43.990

I mean, re-recording the

10:47.333 --> 10:48.600
Yeah, I completely agree.

10:48.718 --> 10:50.220
I mean, the Shannon and me version

10:50.286 --> 10:51.921
is better than the Molly and me version.

10:51.988 --> 10:53.957
- Technically.
- Yeah, technically.

10:54.023 --> 10:56.626
I just Randy's probably
just coming from a place

10:56.693 --> 10:58.661
where he feels the other
version was more fun.

10:58.728 --> 10:59.836
Yeah, I see that.

10:59.836 --> 11:01.798
But the version with Shannon was great.

11:01.865 --> 11:03.900
- Technically.
- Technically it is.

11:04.090 --> 11:05.317
- Technically.
- Technically.

11:09.330 --> 11:10.337

11:11.307 --> 11:12.742

11:12.809 --> 11:14.911

11:17.247 --> 11:18.831

- Yeah.

11:29.259 --> 11:30.627

11:30.693 --> 11:32.028

11:32.095 --> 11:33.296
Molly, I need to talk to you.

11:33.363 --> 11:34.735
I'll give you some space.

11:36.205 --> 11:39.699
Molly, we're shooting a new
Farmer Zack's commercial.

11:40.517 --> 11:42.415
And we need you to sing the jingle again.

11:43.173 --> 11:45.408
- With you?
- Yeah, with me.

11:45.475 --> 11:46.643
Like last time?

11:46.709 --> 11:47.644
Hey, babe.

11:47.710 --> 11:48.745
Like last time.

11:48.812 --> 11:50.313
My name is Tim.

11:50.686 --> 11:52.449
Well, I ain't seen anything pretty as you

11:52.515 --> 11:53.583
in about a minute or two.

11:55.064 --> 11:56.086
Doubt it.

11:56.111 --> 11:57.376
Shut up. Sorry, Tim.

11:57.401 --> 11:59.489
It's fine. I actually need this right now.

11:59.556 --> 12:01.591
Somebody called me Chucky on the Internet.

12:01.951 --> 12:03.693

12:04.553 --> 12:06.992
You. Shut up.

12:08.531 --> 12:11.134
Sam, the last time we sang that song,

12:11.201 --> 12:12.368
we were in love.

12:12.435 --> 12:14.314
Yeah, we almost got engaged.

12:14.773 --> 12:16.206
I put a ring in a piece of cake.

12:16.272 --> 12:17.497
I ate the cake.

12:17.741 --> 12:19.509
And then, when we went through your stool,

12:20.061 --> 12:21.585
there were two diamond rings in there.

12:22.157 --> 12:23.823
That's how I knew you were cheating on me.

12:24.352 --> 12:26.616
Sam, I'm still so sorry about that.

12:26.683 --> 12:28.351
We don't have to go down that road.

12:28.418 --> 12:30.553
Just... re-record the
jingle with me, okay?

12:30.972 --> 12:32.058
Yeah, sure.

12:32.555 --> 12:33.890
I figure I owe you one.

12:34.355 --> 12:36.432
Molly? Can I get your set of keys?

12:36.457 --> 12:37.601
He wants to get let out of there.

12:37.601 --> 12:38.746
He wants to get a better look at my body.

12:38.746 --> 12:40.604

17:56.753 --> 17:58.207
What?

17:58.274 --> 18:00.243
This is coming out of nowhere.

18:00.309 --> 18:01.677
Is there something wrong with the song?

18:01.744 --> 18:03.112
No, uh... well,

18:03.179 --> 18:05.596
we did have to re-record
the song with Molly.

18:05.706 --> 18:06.916
But it's only because the...

18:06.983 --> 18:08.951
The client thought there
was no spark in ours,

18:09.018 --> 18:10.286
which is kind of my point.

18:10.353 --> 18:12.147
There's, like, no spark here.

18:12.172 --> 18:13.423
What are you gonna do?

18:13.489 --> 18:15.627
Spend the rest of your
life hanging out with Tim

18:15.652 --> 18:17.528
telling vulgar high school
stories about your ass

18:17.593 --> 18:18.661
and your testicles?

18:18.728 --> 18:20.126
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:20.958 --> 18:23.332
I never said my balls came out, okay?

18:23.399 --> 18:24.434
I mean, they did.

18:24.500 --> 18:25.732
Got a huge laugh.

18:26.936 --> 18:29.742
Look, Shannon, you're perfect.

18:30.874 --> 18:33.417
But we're not perfect for each other.

18:33.843 --> 18:35.445
And I don't think either
of us should settle

18:35.511 --> 18:36.679
for anything less.

18:46.447 --> 18:47.448
Sam...

18:48.090 --> 18:49.325
I just want you to know

18:49.392 --> 18:51.930
that I never felt like I was settling.

18:53.429 --> 18:54.380
I did.

18:54.764 --> 18:56.132
I... I felt like I was settling.

18:57.767 --> 18:59.202
- Damn it, Sam.
- Oh, sorry.

18:59.268 --> 19:00.770
S... ah, oof. No, I'm sorry.

19:03.940 --> 19:05.013
Love you.

19:06.175 --> 19:07.510
Oh, I'm s... I'm sorry.

19:07.577 --> 19:10.093
<i>- Listen up, society.</i>
- Tim.

19:10.302 --> 19:12.315
You posted that video under my name?

19:12.520 --> 19:13.983
- No. <i>
- Cease and desist...</i>

19:14.050 --> 19:16.452
Why, what happened? Did
you get hacked by Anonymous?

19:16.519 --> 19:17.987
Well, I did it.

19:18.054 --> 19:21.524
Slingin' single Sammy is back town, baby.

19:22.009 --> 19:23.427
I'm sorry, buddy. That must've been hard.

19:23.493 --> 19:25.625
It was the hardest thing I've
ever had to do in my life.

19:25.927 --> 19:27.166
She was sweet.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.276
And Mom and Dad will be crushed.

19:29.412 --> 19:30.666
But ten years from now,

19:30.733 --> 19:31.968
you don't want to wake up and realize

19:32.034 --> 19:33.269
you married the wrong person.

19:33.336 --> 19:34.704
- Yep, yeah.
- That's true.

19:34.771 --> 19:35.872
Chrissy's right. She could've turned out

19:35.938 --> 19:37.240
to be a child molester.

19:37.306 --> 19:38.541
- What?
- What?

19:38.738 --> 19:40.084
Well, I'm just... I'm just saying,

19:40.109 --> 19:42.411
Chrissy's saying, ten years is a long time.

19:42.478 --> 19:43.780
A lot could happen.

19:43.846 --> 19:45.281
She could turned into a child molester.

19:45.348 --> 19:46.949
That is not what I'm saying.

19:47.016 --> 19:48.618
Tim, how do you "turn
into" a child molester?

19:48.684 --> 19:51.053
Uh, you get molested by one, Sam.

19:51.120 --> 19:53.055
It's not like getting bit by a werewolf.

19:53.122 --> 19:55.124
Uh, whatever, I'm just agreeing,

19:55.191 --> 19:57.427
Mom and Dad are gonna be crushed.

19:57.583 --> 19:59.896
Hey, to Shannon.

19:59.962 --> 20:01.364
- To Shannon.
- To Shannon.

20:01.431 --> 20:02.543
God bless her.

20:04.367 --> 20:06.269
Get her off these streets
before she [BLEEP] a kid.

20:06.294 --> 20:07.511
Baby, no.

20:07.612 --> 20:10.177
