34:28.389 --> 34:30.590
I've never felt better.

34:38.433 --> 34:40.100
Thank you.

34:43.188 --> 34:45.688
For the record, Maggie,
about Hal, I'm sorry about --

34:45.690 --> 34:47.407
You have nothing
to be sorry for.

34:47.409 --> 34:51.777
Hal and I screwed that one up
all on our own -- especially me.

34:53.165 --> 34:56.949
Look, we're not gonna go
for cosmos or anything, but...

34:56.952 --> 35:00.503
Yeah, you and I
are gonna need each other.

35:02.007 --> 35:03.790
I want to believe
that they're innocent.

35:03.792 --> 35:05.292
You're right
to be cautious,

35:05.294 --> 35:08.511
but you know the right thing
to do here, Katie.

35:08.513 --> 35:11.464
I want to be clear, Dan --
<i>you</i> are not under suspicion,

35:11.466 --> 35:14.017
but your friends have
fallen under Espheni influence.

35:14.019 --> 35:16.519
And their court-martial
will determine to what extent.

35:17.306 --> 35:18.388
Court-martial?

35:18.390 --> 35:19.856
Of course.

35:19.858 --> 35:22.642
This is a military base.
Military law still holds.

35:22.644 --> 35:24.978
Is that
what you've been doing here?

35:24.980 --> 35:26.563
Holding trials
for human collaborators

35:26.565 --> 35:28.148
who might have turned?

35:28.150 --> 35:30.700
We have been fighting the enemy
on <i>all</i> fronts.

35:30.702 --> 35:32.903
Dan, you know
how this war can change people.

35:32.905 --> 35:35.288
I've been fighting
beside Tom Mason for years,

35:35.290 --> 35:36.740
and he is no traitor.

35:36.742 --> 35:38.658
And a court-martial
is no supposition of guilt,

35:38.660 --> 35:40.126
but there are
inconsistencies

35:40.128 --> 35:42.045
that need to be probed
and documented by a judge.

35:42.047 --> 35:43.463
Judge?

35:43.465 --> 35:44.965
Judge?

35:44.967 --> 35:48.134
The Katie
that I used to know

35:48.136 --> 35:51.671
would have looked for the good
in these men.

35:51.673 --> 35:54.841
And they are good men.
They are, Katie.

35:59.982 --> 36:02.816
When I found you hiding
in that bombed-out building,

36:02.818 --> 36:04.734
afraid
to go back into the fight,

36:04.736 --> 36:06.853
I knew there was
a good soldier there.

36:06.855 --> 36:10.523
And for that, I will forever
be in your debt, Dan.

36:10.525 --> 36:12.025
And that debt
was repaid in full

36:12.027 --> 36:14.327
by you becoming
the soldier you became.

36:14.329 --> 36:16.029
The <i>woman</i> you became.

36:17.032 --> 36:21.251
I believed in you,
Katie.

36:21.253 --> 36:23.703
I believe in you.

36:23.705 --> 36:26.006
And I believe in
Tom Mason.

36:41.223 --> 36:43.773
Ain't over
till it's over.

36:50.615 --> 36:52.315
[ Door opens ]

36:52.317 --> 36:54.067
Room!

37:14.222 --> 37:15.305
[ Door opens ]

37:17.309 --> 37:20.343
What the hell
did you do to him?

37:20.345 --> 37:21.895
Hey, what happened?

37:22.764 --> 37:25.432
They pulled out
one of my spikes.

37:26.935 --> 37:28.902
You tortured my son?

37:30.105 --> 37:33.490
He was a perceived threat
to our security, Mr. Mason.

37:33.492 --> 37:34.941
Captain?

37:39.831 --> 37:43.166
This court-martial
is in session.

37:46.766 --> 37:50.402
Mr. Mason, you admitted
to having eye worms...

37:50.404 --> 37:52.404
along with your son Hal.

37:53.957 --> 37:59.277
They were both cleared
by a certified doctor.

37:59.279 --> 38:00.946
You mean Tom's wife?

38:00.948 --> 38:02.481
Who's employed
Volm technology

38:02.483 --> 38:04.800
to remove Espheni harnesses
like Ben's.

38:04.802 --> 38:08.320
Ben's spikes
have been a great resource.

38:08.322 --> 38:10.255
But there's
a telepathic connection, no?

38:10.257 --> 38:12.891
You can't be certain
that your son

38:12.893 --> 38:15.343
has not shared information
with the enemy, can you?

38:15.345 --> 38:18.430
No, Ben received Intel from
the overlord that helped us --

38:18.432 --> 38:19.731
that helped <i>all</i> of us.

38:19.733 --> 38:22.601
Oh, is that
when he and the girl...

38:22.603 --> 38:26.938
Maggie helped you interrogate
a captured overlord?

38:26.940 --> 38:30.525
I heard that was
quite a parlor trick.

38:33.914 --> 38:37.032
We took out a major base
of Espheni operations.

38:37.034 --> 38:39.167
Right --
the hatchery.

38:39.169 --> 38:42.871
And the, uh,
power grid in Boston.

38:42.873 --> 38:44.956
No, that was before.
The moon.

38:44.958 --> 38:48.593
And, of course,
the Mason militias.

38:48.595 --> 38:50.679
[ Scoffs ]
We didn't name them that.

38:50.681 --> 38:52.380
The word got out
about my father.

38:52.382 --> 38:53.465
That's where
the name came --

38:53.467 --> 38:55.133
Thanks to the Volm,
no?

38:55.135 --> 38:57.636
Do these Mason militia

38:57.638 --> 39:01.440
know who the man
they're blindly following is?

39:01.442 --> 39:02.808
Who's telling them
to march on D.C.?

39:02.810 --> 39:04.559
Oh, I don't think
we're ever gonna get to D.C.

39:04.561 --> 39:05.861
If we keep
fighting each other.

39:05.863 --> 39:07.362
I mean, I'm sorry --
I can't believe

39:07.364 --> 39:09.064
that the members of the 14th
would rather sit here

39:09.066 --> 39:10.699
and waste their time
in a kangaroo court

39:10.701 --> 39:11.900
instead of fight--
tell me more about this

39:11.902 --> 39:16.204
Espheni communication device
you found.

39:16.206 --> 39:17.989
Why did you lie

39:17.991 --> 39:20.709
about two members of your team
who stayed behind,

39:20.711 --> 39:22.043
one of which
was the Volm,

39:22.045 --> 39:24.796
who you insisted
went back to his ship?

39:30.254 --> 39:32.220
Okay.
Different angle.

39:32.222 --> 39:35.056
How did you know where
the power core was located?

39:35.058 --> 39:38.677
We saw green flashes
coming from the moon.

39:38.679 --> 39:40.512
<i>I</i> saw them,
and then there was

39:40.514 --> 39:42.764
a tow-rope of Beamers
cruising up there.

39:42.766 --> 39:44.015
Beamers?
That's right.

39:44.017 --> 39:48.186
I-I'm just a soldier,
so I could be wrong,

39:48.188 --> 39:51.106
but I'm finding it
very difficult to understand

39:51.108 --> 39:53.942
how it is that you flew a Beamer
to the moon

39:53.944 --> 39:57.245
and, as you said,
lived to tell the tale.

39:57.247 --> 40:00.499
How <i>did</i> you get back here,
Mr. Mason?

40:02.035 --> 40:03.602
Mr. Mason?

40:05.472 --> 40:06.705
Mr. Mason!

40:06.707 --> 40:11.259
After you supposedly
blew up the power core,

40:11.261 --> 40:13.211
how did you get back
to earth?

40:16.350 --> 40:18.099
I'm not quite sure.

40:21.555 --> 40:25.106
And yet, you still hold firm
in your belief

40:25.108 --> 40:27.642
that the eye worms
and the spikes

40:27.644 --> 40:29.728
and all the other
alien tech

40:29.730 --> 40:32.397
that you and your people
have been infected by

40:32.399 --> 40:34.482
is completely gone.

40:36.570 --> 40:39.237
I don't have to
defend myself to you.

40:39.239 --> 40:40.622
[ Chuckles ]

40:40.624 --> 40:42.457
This isn't a court-martial.
This is a joke.

40:42.459 --> 40:44.576
How dare you.

40:44.578 --> 40:48.163
How dare you throw
our accomplishments back at us as lies.

40:48.165 --> 40:50.799
You want to put me on trial,
do it when the war is over.

40:50.801 --> 40:52.300
Tom.
What? This is absurd.

40:52.302 --> 40:53.802
Putting humans on trial
in the middle of this war,

40:53.804 --> 40:54.970
that's not
an accomplishment.

40:54.972 --> 40:56.588
That, Captain,
is treason.

40:56.590 --> 40:58.256
Weaver: Take it easy.

40:58.258 --> 40:59.808
What?

40:59.810 --> 41:01.977
I hope you're keeping
very good records here today,

41:01.979 --> 41:04.262
because history
will judge you --<i>all</i> of you --

41:04.264 --> 41:06.514
for what you're doing.

41:13.523 --> 41:15.657
Captain?

41:31.959 --> 41:34.376
Tom Mason, Hal Mason,
and Ben Mason,

41:34.378 --> 41:37.929
you have been found guilty
of collaborating with the enemy.

For these crimes
against your country,

41:40.467 --> 41:43.685
