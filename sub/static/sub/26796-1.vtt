<i>What is it about
dogs that brings us so much joy?</i>

00:19.992 --> 00:22.558
<i>Is it the quiet companionship</i>

00:22.560 --> 00:25.429
<i>or the scientifically-proven
health benefits?</i>

00:26.198 --> 00:27.396
<i>Or maybe
it's because dogs are</i>

00:27.398 --> 00:28.564
<i>the most adorable creatures</i>

00:28.566 --> 00:30.167
<i>to ever roam the planet.</i>

00:30.169 --> 00:32.168

00:37.942 --> 00:40.277
<i>My boyfriend and I rescued him
five years ago,</i>

00:40.279 --> 00:43.246
<i>and it's the best thing
we've ever done.</i>

00:43.248 --> 00:45.481
<i>So if you love your dog
as much as I do,</i>

00:45.483 --> 00:47.349

wondering,</i>

00:47.351 --> 00:49.518
<i>"What is my dog thinking?"</i>

<i>So tell us,</i>

01:04.303 --> 01:06.669
<i>why do dogs need a therapist?</i>

01:06.671 --> 01:08.171
<i>A lot of people</i>
<i>don't know this</i>,

01:08.173 --> 01:11.842
<i>but 35 percent of all dogs
experience self-loathing.</i>

01:11.844 --> 01:15.477
And what do you do to help a dog
overcome self-loathing?

01:15.479 --> 01:19.149
I would tell you,
but then I'd have to charge you.

01:20.319 --> 01:22.419
<i>I wish we had more time.</i>

01:22.421 --> 01:23.787
<i>Oh, I could grab a cup of cof...</i>

<i>So if your dog
is experiencing self-loathing</i>

01:25.690 --> 01:27.857

I were a dog with a fever

07:57.315 --> 07:59.114
just so he could, like,
take my temperature.

07:59.116 --> 08:01.284
He could wear

09:37.848 --> 09:39.749
I can return it. Easy.
I have the receipt.

09:39.751 --> 09:41.217
No big deal.
I'll do it on the way to class.

09:41.219 --> 09:42.719
- Oh, thank you. That'd be great.
- Yeah.

09:42.721 --> 09:43.986
Yeah. You know what,
that's crazy.

09:43.988 --> 09:45.188
I shouldn't make you
return it.

09:45.190 --> 09:46.456
She'll be fine with pink.
It's fine.

09:46.458 --> 09:48.725
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
It's fine. It's fine.

09:48.727 --> 09:51.159
I don't mind.
I like doing it. Really.

09:51.161 --> 09:54.396
This room is gonna be wonderful.
The dog's gonna be blue.

09:54.398 --> 09:56.466
How many cups of coffee
was it again?

09:56.468 --> 09:59.067
It's just, we've
waited for this for so long.

09:59.069 --> 10:01.136
- I know.
- We have come so close.

10:01.138 --> 10:01.937
I know.

10:01.939 --> 10:03.506
So now it's finally happening.

10:03.508 --> 10:06.409
We're finally parents.
And I'm just so nervous.

10:06.411 --> 10:07.844
I'm nervous, too.

10:07.846 --> 10:09.178
I'm sure Amelia is nervous.

10:09.180 --> 10:11.047
This is not just
another visit for her.

10:11.049 --> 10:12.616
She's coming here to stay.

10:13.852 --> 10:14.985
Yeah.

10:17.955 --> 10:19.390
What if I'm not good at it?

10:21.158 --> 10:22.394
At what?

10:23.595 --> 10:24.995
Being a mom.

10:26.331 --> 10:27.265
It's a big job.

10:28.031 --> 10:29.432
What if I'm terrible?

10:29.434 --> 10:31.501
What if something happens
and I don't know what to do?

10:31.503 --> 10:33.571
There is absolutely no way
that's gonna happen.

10:34.305 --> 10:36.839
For me, the fact
that you care this much already

10:36.841 --> 10:38.142
makes you a good mom.

10:39.410 --> 10:40.645
So you did it.

10:41.679 --> 10:43.311
I love you.

10:43.313 --> 10:44.248
I love you.

10:45.983 --> 10:48.183
- Oh, no! Who is this?
- Hi!

10:48.185 --> 10:50.051
- I found her yesterday.
- Aw!

10:50.053 --> 10:51.821
I had to hide her here
'cause my dumb building

10:51.823 --> 10:52.855
doesn't allow dogs.

10:52.857 --> 10:54.724
Oh, that is a dumb building.

10:54.726 --> 10:57.026
- Ugh!
- Come here.

10:57.028 --> 11:00.195
I can't just dump her off
at some sad shelter.

11:00.197 --> 11:03.064
Can I, girl? I can't do that.

11:03.066 --> 11:05.701
- What shall I do?
- Um, hello!

11:05.703 --> 11:09.004
This is the perfect excuse to
get some face-time with hot vet.

11:09.006 --> 11:10.473
Oh, my God. Yes!

11:10.475 --> 11:12.174
- Okay, we have to get our head in the game.
- Okay.

11:12.176 --> 11:14.042
Do you have your make-up
with you?

11:14.044 --> 11:15.313
Why? Do I look bad?

11:16.314 --> 11:19.248
No! we...
we could all look better.

11:19.250 --> 11:21.984
The break-up has
been really tough on Sam.

11:21.986 --> 11:24.219
He's lethargic,
his appetite is down.

11:24.221 --> 11:26.923
His bowel movements
are way off, but...

11:26.925 --> 11:30.959
I'm sorry, should I be talking
about his bowel movements here?

11:30.961 --> 11:33.094
This is the best place
for you to be talking

11:33.096 --> 11:34.632
about his bowel movements.

11:35.633 --> 11:36.998
And what about you?

11:37.000 --> 11:38.835
I'm fine. I'm great.

11:38.837 --> 11:40.636
I've just been...

11:40.638 --> 11:43.508
focused on work, and, uh...

11:44.576 --> 11:45.975
You're writing that down?

11:45.977 --> 11:48.043
You're writing down
that I'm fine?

11:48.045 --> 11:49.779
Or are you writing down
that I asked

11:49.781 --> 11:51.046
if you're writing down
that I'm fine?

11:51.048 --> 11:52.380
Yes. Look.

11:52.382 --> 11:55.485
What Sam really needs
is to move on.

11:55.487 --> 11:58.788
He needs to get out there
and meet some new dogs.

11:58.790 --> 12:00.523
Sam wants to.

12:00.525 --> 12:01.924
I-I know that he does,

12:01.926 --> 12:04.025
but he's just too scared.

12:04.027 --> 12:06.963
What is Sam scared of exactly?

12:06.965 --> 12:08.366
Of abandonment.

12:09.334 --> 12:10.635
Getting his heart broken.

12:11.970 --> 12:13.301
Sam needs to remember

12:13.303 --> 12:15.805
that if he protects
his heart too much,

12:15.807 --> 12:17.374
he'll never be happy.

12:20.979 --> 12:22.143
Yeah.

12:22.145 --> 12:24.079
Sam's going to be fine.

12:25.450 --> 12:29.118
See, Sam,
you're gonna be just fine.

12:29.120 --> 12:31.189
That'll be $300.

12:32.457 --> 12:33.558
Oh.

12:35.193 --> 12:37.726
Hey, you're gonna be fine, okay.

12:37.728 --> 12:39.561
It's just a little check-up.

12:39.563 --> 12:40.798
How do I look?

12:44.769 --> 12:46.602
- Oh.
- Huh?

12:46.604 --> 12:47.539
Hey.

12:52.810 --> 12:54.345
- Tara?
- Hi!

12:55.847 --> 12:57.248
Oh, hi.

12:59.018 --> 13:00.181
It's okay, girl.

13:00.183 --> 13:02.519
There is no reason
to be nervous.

13:09.359 --> 13:10.993
- Hi. Dr. Mike.
- Hey.

13:10.995 --> 13:12.227
Oh, I know.

13:12.229 --> 13:14.797
I-I serve you coffee
across the street...

13:14.799 --> 13:15.767
sometimes.

13:17.335 --> 13:19.368
- I'm Tara.
- Tara! Right, yeah!

13:19.370 --> 13:21.470
- Tara who-who serves me coffee.
- That's me.

13:21.472 --> 13:23.572
And I enjoy it every time.
H-how are you?

13:23.574 --> 13:25.140
- It's good to see you.
- You, too.

13:25.142 --> 13:27.843
Um, wow, by the looks
of this little lady,

13:27.845 --> 13:29.912
she's been on the street
a long time.

13:29.914 --> 13:31.448
Don't I relate?

13:34.052 --> 13:35.484
To being on the street?

13:35.486 --> 13:37.887
It was a joke.
I-I was just...

13:37.889 --> 13:39.154
- Oh, you're not a...
- Joking.

13:39.156 --> 13:41.490
No, you're not
a prostitute. Okay.

13:41.492 --> 13:44.393
So she still has
her anterior fontanel.

13:45.396 --> 13:47.329
That's a soft spot,
like babies have.

13:47.331 --> 13:49.264
Basically, she has
a little hole in her head.

13:49.266 --> 13:51.433
- Oh, poor thing.
- No, no, but don't worry.

13:51.435 --> 13:54.070
Dr. Mike's got the cure,
I'm gonna take her in the back

13:54.072 --> 13:55.503
for some X-rays on her noggin.

13:55.505 --> 13:56.338
You stay here.

13:56.340 --> 13:58.408
- I will be <i>aqui.</i>
- Yeah, great.

13:59.142 --> 14:00.712
<i>Aqui?</i> What?

14:06.351 --> 14:08.384
The helmet
will prevent any injuries.

14:08.386 --> 14:11.286
As we vets say,
"It only takes one pine cone."

14:12.356 --> 14:13.722
Oh, I've never seen a helmet

14:13.724 --> 14:15.925
look so good before.

14:15.927 --> 14:17.192
I wish I could keep her.

14:17.194 --> 14:19.260
Listen, I work
with a great rescue.

14:19.262 --> 14:21.196
If you need help
finding a home for her,

14:21.198 --> 14:22.430
you can actually
leave her with me.

14:22.432 --> 14:23.532
I'll make all the arrangements.

14:23.534 --> 14:25.534
- Are you serious?
- Absolutely.

14:25.536 --> 14:26.702
That is so nice.

14:26.704 --> 14:29.472
And I'm gonna miss you, girl.

14:29.474 --> 14:31.407
I hope you find a nice home.

14:31.409 --> 14:34.011
- I wish you could be with me.
- Aw!

14:34.013 --> 14:35.612
Goodbyes are so tough.

14:36.446 --> 14:38.647
And where did you come from?

14:38.649 --> 14:39.851
Shaker Heights, Ohio.

14:40.952 --> 14:42.317
- No.
- I'm just kidding.

14:42.319 --> 14:43.888
I know you were complimenting
my bedside manner.

14:44.956 --> 14:46.254
But yeah.
Shaker Heights, Ohio,

14:46.256 --> 14:47.757
- until I was ten.
- Oh.

14:49.894 --> 14:50.993
You don't have to worry.

14:50.995 --> 14:52.395
They're gonna take
great care of her.

14:52.397 --> 14:53.629
- You're amazing.
- Hey.

14:53.631 --> 14:55.331
Some people are built
for this sort of thing

14:55.333 --> 14:57.100
and I happen to be
one of those people.

14:57.102 --> 14:58.367
Well, thank you.

14:58.369 --> 15:00.335
I, uh, I hope to see you around.

15:00.337 --> 15:01.971
I hope so, too, Tina.

15:01.973 --> 15:03.238
Say goodbye to Tina.

15:03.240 --> 15:05.640
Yeah, um, uh, it's Tara.

15:05.642 --> 15:08.211
It doesn't matter.
Okay, love you. Bye.

15:21.325 --> 15:25.293
<i>♪ Oh what does it take
to be lonesome? ♪</i>

15:25.295 --> 15:27.762
- <i>♪ Nothin' at all

15:27.764 --> 15:31.934

15:31.936 --> 15:33.671
<i>♪ Get out of here</i>

15:34.839 --> 15:37.274

15:41.713 --> 15:42.647
Hey.

15:43.581 --> 15:44.780
Run.

15:44.782 --> 15:46.248
I just want to apologize
to Ruthie about yesterday.

15:46.250 --> 15:48.216
Okay, run away.
Whatever that thing is,

15:48.218 --> 15:50.119
it's not your sister
anymore, okay?

15:50.121 --> 15:51.686
Pregnancy has changed her.

15:51.688 --> 15:53.421
- Greg, move away from the door.
- I'm not going to.

15:53.423 --> 15:55.191
- Greg.
- She has the rage of a chimp.

15:55.193 --> 15:56.558
- Greg.
- Please don't go in there.

15:56.560 --> 15:58.794
I'm gonna pick you up
and move you like a baby.

15:58.796 --> 16:00.395
No, you're not.

16:00.397 --> 16:02.198
- Flee, flee. See...
- G-Greg...

16:02.200 --> 16:04.433
- No, I can't.
- Greg, Greg, I don't wanna...

16:04.435 --> 16:06.235
- Greg, I'm gonna lift you up...
- Don't lift me up.

16:06.237 --> 16:07.503
Come on. Come on!

16:07.505 --> 16:10.272
- Move you like a baby.
- Don't lift me up again.

16:10.274 --> 16:12.741
Dang it! Don't pick a person up.

16:12.743 --> 16:13.945
Do not pick a person up.

16:15.046 --> 16:18.114
I think I'm a pretty
good sister. Right?

16:18.116 --> 16:20.683
- I think I do a lot for you.
- Yeah.

16:20.685 --> 16:23.753
I take care of you financially
when you need it,

16:23.755 --> 16:25.588
which is a lot.

16:25.590 --> 16:28.023
Look, it's not like
I missed the baby.

16:28.025 --> 16:29.360
I just missed the shower.

16:30.361 --> 16:33.496
Greg here, he tries his best,
he really does,

16:33.498 --> 16:36.065
but he gets it wrong
98 percent of the time.

16:36.067 --> 16:37.066
I'm on therapy.

16:37.068 --> 16:38.500
He had to put some bizarre crap

16:38.502 --> 16:40.401
on from his phone,
which put everybody

16:40.403 --> 16:41.871
in a very weird headspace.

16:41.873 --> 16:43.739
My taste in music
is eclectic at best

16:43.741 --> 16:45.708
and I take
partial responsibility.

16:45.710 --> 16:47.308
It is partially your fault.

16:47.310 --> 16:49.578
A 100 percent partially
my fault, without a doubt.

16:49.580 --> 16:52.683
And then, my sweet angel
of a dog, Charlie...

16:53.451 --> 16:55.586
goes all Cujo on my gifts.

16:57.655 --> 16:58.656
But you...

16:59.656 --> 17:00.957
you weren't there for me.

17:03.194 --> 17:04.325
I'm sorry.

17:06.396 --> 17:08.230
- Are you crying?
- Yes.

17:08.232 --> 17:09.832
This is what happens.

17:11.102 --> 17:13.669
Charlie, please!

17:13.671 --> 17:14.672
I can explain.

17:15.506 --> 17:18.240
Frunk had this... had this,
like, surprise audition...

17:18.242 --> 17:21.343
- "Frunk?" What is that?
- Frunk's my band.

17:21.345 --> 17:24.412
Frunk? What is that?
That's not a word.

17:24.414 --> 17:25.880
- It's not a word.
- It doesn't have to be a word.

17:25.882 --> 17:28.150
- It's the name of a band.
- What does it mean?

17:28.152 --> 17:29.317
It's a typo at best.

17:29.319 --> 17:30.585
That's the beauty of the word

17:30.587 --> 17:32.453
is that it's...
it could be anything.

17:32.455 --> 17:33.691
Wanna hear a great band name?

17:34.959 --> 17:36.025
Train.

17:36.027 --> 17:36.961
Great name.

17:37.695 --> 17:39.628
- Goo Goo Dolls.
- Great name.

17:39.630 --> 17:41.063
- Garth Brooks.
- That's a... that's a...

17:41.065 --> 17:42.364
That's a man's name.

17:42.366 --> 17:43.766
Charlie, please,

17:43.768 --> 17:46.602
- for the love of God, stop it.
- Stop it, stop it.

17:46.604 --> 17:47.769
Frunk is also a Greek...

17:47.771 --> 17:49.737
If you say the word Frunk
one more time,

17:49.739 --> 17:50.940
I swear to God...

17:50.942 --> 17:53.242
Ruthie, you know when you,
when you do that to me,

17:53.244 --> 17:54.442
now I have to say it.

17:54.444 --> 17:56.680
Don't... don't say it.

17:58.683 --> 17:59.650
Don't.

18:01.384 --> 18:03.185
Frunk.

18:04.222 --> 18:06.055
Oh, my God!

18:06.057 --> 18:08.123
- Oh! Frunk!
- Is it coming? Is it happening?

18:08.125 --> 18:09.859
See, it actually works great.

18:11.761 --> 18:13.295
Okay. Whew!

18:13.297 --> 18:14.997
Are you guys, like,
not hearing what I'm saying

18:14.999 --> 18:16.631
because of the contractions,
but my building

18:16.633 --> 18:19.235
has a strict no-dog policy,
so I'll get evicted.

18:19.237 --> 18:20.401
This is how you help me.

18:20.403 --> 18:21.670
He needs a walk
in the morning...

18:21.672 --> 18:22.972
- Watch yourself.
- ...no human food,

18:22.974 --> 18:24.607
and especially no chocolate.

18:24.609 --> 18:27.445
Greg, why did you do this to me?

18:30.349 --> 18:31.482
Yeah.

18:33.117 --> 18:34.051
I know.

18:36.953 --> 18:38.354
Welcome home, Amelia.

18:38.356 --> 18:39.989
This is your new home.

18:39.991 --> 18:41.522
Yeah.

18:41.524 --> 18:43.691
This is where
we're gonna live together

18:43.693 --> 18:44.827
as a family.

18:44.829 --> 18:45.995
Yeah.

18:45.997 --> 18:47.528
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

18:47.530 --> 18:49.031
This is the living room.

18:49.033 --> 18:52.234
And, uh, that's the kitchen...

18:52.236 --> 18:53.636
If you ever get scared,

18:53.638 --> 18:55.638
we have a night light here

18:55.640 --> 18:57.274
that puts stars on the ceiling.

18:57.276 --> 19:01.143
It's so cool, it's got
constellations, shooting stars.

19:01.145 --> 19:02.410
If you ever wanna cuddle,

19:02.412 --> 19:04.079
we have all these
little friends for you.

19:04.081 --> 19:05.080
Look at those guys.

19:05.082 --> 19:06.282
And then we have this guy.

19:06.284 --> 19:08.317
Oh, look at that. A blue dog!

19:08.319 --> 19:09.586
You love blue.

19:11.521 --> 19:13.155
So I've been told.

19:13.157 --> 19:16.258
Well, hey,
we also have a teepee.

19:16.260 --> 19:18.127
Oh, wow!

19:18.129 --> 19:20.529
Do you think I can fit in there?
I bet I can fit in there.

19:20.531 --> 19:22.198
- You think I can fit in there?
- I don't know.

19:22.200 --> 19:23.365
Yeah. I think so.

19:23.367 --> 19:25.833
Bear, get out of my way.
Oh, yeah.

19:25.835 --> 19:29.305
There's so much more room in
here than it looks like, guys.

19:29.307 --> 19:31.840
I think we should move out of
the house and into this teepee.

19:31.842 --> 19:33.309
- Yeah.
- Yay.

19:33.311 --> 19:34.944
Wait. Amelia, I'm lost.

19:34.946 --> 19:36.577
- <i>You gotta help me out here.
- Honey.</i>

19:36.579 --> 19:37.880
- Kurt, honey?
- Huh?

19:37.882 --> 19:40.215
Um, let's...

19:40.217 --> 19:41.583
Let's put that teepee down.

19:41.585 --> 19:42.584
Yeah. All right.

19:42.586 --> 19:44.553
Our room is just down the hall,

19:44.555 --> 19:46.555
and the bathroom's
right next door.

19:46.557 --> 19:47.889
And, honey,
put the teepee...

19:47.891 --> 19:50.026
Yeah, okay.
We'll do that later.

19:52.129 --> 19:53.929
Yeah. Uh...

19:53.931 --> 19:55.596
And lastly,

19:55.598 --> 19:58.601
you can call me mommy
and him daddy.

20:00.838 --> 20:02.371
- Or whatever.
- Uh, or...

20:02.373 --> 20:03.806
Or you can call me Grace
and him Kurt.

20:03.808 --> 20:06.909
- Yeah. Or me Kurt and him Grace.
- Oh, no. What? Yeah.

20:06.911 --> 20:08.677
What? No, that, no,
that's gonna be too confusing.

20:08.679 --> 20:10.347
You know what?
The point is

20:10.349 --> 20:11.813
you can call us
whatever you like.

20:11.815 --> 20:13.750
It's whatever
makes you comfortable.

20:14.918 --> 20:15.852
Okay.

20:18.189 --> 20:19.587
Um...

20:19.589 --> 20:21.390
Do you want a little time

20:21.392 --> 20:22.590
to check out your room
by yourself?

20:22.592 --> 20:24.561
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah?

20:25.696 --> 20:27.563
- Okay. Great. Okay.
- Okay. Yes.

20:27.565 --> 20:30.766
Uh, I'm just gonna leave,
leave this guy, hm,

20:30.768 --> 20:34.003
and, um, we'll be
in the next room.

20:34.005 --> 20:35.772
- Have fun.
- It's gonna be great.

20:36.506 --> 20:37.640
It's gonna be...

20:47.218 --> 20:50.853
Hey, Mabel.
Hey, what's all that?

20:51.622 --> 20:53.090
Look at you, little chubby.

20:54.025 --> 20:55.559
You ain't so tough.

20:57.028 --> 20:58.762
You ain't so tough.

21:04.135 --> 21:05.970
Well, there we go.

21:08.305 --> 21:09.706
I don't know, sweetheart.

21:10.673 --> 21:13.110
Looks like we're gonna
have to do without.

21:16.047 --> 21:19.116
You are so fat. We're gonna
slim and trim you up.

21:22.852 --> 21:25.922
How far you think we can go
before we get back home, huh?

21:26.790 --> 21:28.958
Uh, I think we can go
a little bit.

21:32.063 --> 21:33.130
Mr. Pepperoni!

21:34.465 --> 21:36.131
Your dog's still fat!

21:37.134 --> 21:38.936
Wise guy.

21:40.971 --> 21:42.571
Mabel. Mabel!

21:43.707 --> 21:45.643
Mabel!

21:53.451 --> 21:54.916
Sir, are you okay?

21:54.918 --> 21:56.684
- It's gonna be fine.
- Mabel.

22:01.525 --> 22:04.893
Shh. Shh. Shh.
You gotta stop barking.

22:04.895 --> 22:06.496
I'm not allowed to have dogs
in my building,

22:06.498 --> 22:08.199
so you cannot bark
like this, all right.

22:09.200 --> 22:11.666
What is your damage, dog?

22:11.668 --> 22:13.502
There better be a boy
in a well somewhere, pal,

22:13.504 --> 22:14.936
for you to be freaking out
like this.

22:19.876 --> 22:22.044
How am I gonna
get you up there?

22:37.528 --> 22:38.928
Oh. Ooh!

22:41.798 --> 22:43.766
Huh. All right.

22:45.802 --> 22:47.668
Damn. Oh, we're caught,
we're caught!

22:47.670 --> 22:49.271
Whoa! Ow!

22:49.273 --> 22:51.306
Okay, gonna get you
out of here real soon.

22:51.308 --> 22:53.208
- Okay? Uh...
- Oh, hey.

22:53.210 --> 22:54.843
Come on in.

22:54.845 --> 22:57.312
- I got ya.
- Okay.

23:02.852 --> 23:04.155
You just finish a gig?

23:05.189 --> 23:06.123
Yup.

23:07.158 --> 23:08.325
It sounds like fun.

23:10.561 --> 23:11.862
Where was it?

23:14.064 --> 23:15.866
Uh, north.

23:22.739 --> 23:25.440
Oh. Uh, goodnight. Just...

23:34.784 --> 23:36.287
Run free, dog.

23:37.254 --> 23:38.287
Enjoy the apartment.

23:38.289 --> 23:40.222
I will let you know
that the cleaning lady

23:40.224 --> 23:41.624
will be here never...

23:41.626 --> 23:42.791
because she does not exist.

23:42.793 --> 23:44.594
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
No people food.

23:44.596 --> 23:45.794
No people food.

23:47.730 --> 23:49.565
You're gonna get me
in some serious trouble.

23:49.567 --> 23:50.898
My sister will kill me.

23:50.900 --> 23:51.933
Though I do appreciate

23:51.935 --> 23:53.701
that you like Del Taco so much.

23:57.341 --> 23:58.773
I'm not gonna help you.

23:58.775 --> 24:01.376
If I take that bag
away from you,

24:01.378 --> 24:02.444
you will never learn.

24:04.148 --> 24:06.250
This is comical.

24:07.318 --> 24:08.685
Smile, bag-face.

24:09.954 --> 24:12.654
Dumb dog.

24:12.656 --> 24:15.156
Watch out for that...
Oh. That hurt.

24:15.158 --> 24:17.024
So did he move out yet?

24:17.026 --> 24:19.228
I threw out the last
of his stuff this morning.

24:19.230 --> 24:21.463
Someone grab me a water
for after. Thanks.

24:21.465 --> 24:24.333
- Hi. Elizabeth Daniels.
- Oh, I know. I'm Jimmy.

24:24.335 --> 24:25.500
- Okay. Cards.
- Yes.

24:25.502 --> 24:27.002
And don't be afraid
to be yourself. All right?

24:27.004 --> 24:28.372
- Yeah. Of course.
- Look up.

24:29.641 --> 24:31.373
- Oh, it was better before. Oh.
- What?

24:31.375 --> 24:32.475
Ten seconds, everyone.

24:32.477 --> 24:33.576
- Ten seconds.
- Okay. Um...

24:34.877 --> 24:36.345
You look nervous. Don't be.
Follow my lead.

24:36.347 --> 24:37.778
- I'll take care of you.
- And we're on in five...

24:37.780 --> 24:40.848
- All right.
- ...four, three, two...

24:40.850 --> 24:43.485
We have a special treat
for you, Los Angeles.

24:43.487 --> 24:44.653
And it's a treat for me, too.

24:44.655 --> 24:45.954
I love this guy.

24:45.956 --> 24:47.788
Joining us in the studio today

24:47.790 --> 24:50.325
is former LA Ram
Jimmy Johnston.

24:50.327 --> 24:52.127
- Welcome, Jimmy. How are you?
- Hey.

24:52.129 --> 24:53.630
It's so good
to have you here today.

24:53.632 --> 24:55.464
Thank you for having me.
Big fan.

24:55.466 --> 24:56.832
Let's start with your injury.

24:56.834 --> 24:58.634
Wow. Okay.
Well, right for the jugular.

24:58.636 --> 25:00.335
Digging deep. Okay.

25:00.337 --> 25:01.969
You tore your ACL
in what turned out to be

25:01.971 --> 25:03.804
your final game in the NFL.

25:03.806 --> 25:05.607
I have to say,
you look terrific now.

25:05.609 --> 25:07.808
Wait. Wait a second.
Wait a second.

25:07.810 --> 25:09.113
You think I look terrific?

25:10.047 --> 25:12.813
Or do your cards tell you
to say that...

25:12.815 --> 25:13.882
- Let me see your...
- Oh, uh.

25:13.884 --> 25:15.917
Please don't touch my cards.

25:15.919 --> 25:18.120
No offense, but maybe,
maybe you put the cards down

25:18.122 --> 25:20.122
and then you and I, we'll
just talk. You know, right?

25:20.124 --> 25:21.758
Like, have a conversation
like real people.

25:21.760 --> 25:23.592
All right? All right?

25:23.594 --> 25:25.059
- Right?
- I'm sorry. I...

25:25.061 --> 25:26.963
You're trying to tell me
how to do my job?

25:27.698 --> 25:28.796
I'm telling you
that I feel like

25:28.798 --> 25:29.897
you can loosen up
a little bit.

25:29.899 --> 25:31.500
I am plenty loose.

25:34.004 --> 25:36.938
Uh, what if I told you
how to athlete?

25:36.940 --> 25:38.640
How to... how to athlete?

25:38.642 --> 25:39.941
Mm-hmm.

25:39.943 --> 25:41.644
You wouldn't feel good
about that. Would you?

25:41.646 --> 25:42.811
I think I'd be open to that.

25:42.813 --> 25:44.781
- You look pretty athletic.
- I am.

25:44.783 --> 25:47.014
- You ever play sports?
- I was on the drill team.

25:47.016 --> 25:48.383
- Drill team?
- Yes.

25:48.385 --> 25:49.618
Not a sport. Okay.

25:49.620 --> 25:51.018
The drill team
is for people

25:51.020 --> 25:52.387
who tried out for the
cheerleading squad,

25:52.389 --> 25:53.789
did not make it.

25:53.791 --> 25:55.123
Yeah, and to all the girls out
there who are on the drill te...

25:55.125 --> 25:56.824
Who would have
rather been cheerleaders

25:56.826 --> 25:58.926
but settled for twirling flags.

25:58.928 --> 26:01.096
Flags are completely different.

26:01.098 --> 26:03.432
To all the kids out there
who are on the flags team now...

26:03.434 --> 26:05.768
- Still not a sport.
- Yes, it is, it's...

26:05.770 --> 26:07.336
You don't know
what you're talking about.

26:07.338 --> 26:09.071
You've been on the air
for, like, five minutes

26:09.073 --> 26:11.238
and you're besmirching
both the flags team

26:11.240 --> 26:13.742
and the drills team
like a typical jock asshole.

26:14.645 --> 26:16.112
Ooh, don't say that.

26:18.582 --> 26:19.847
Speaking of the weather,

26:19.849 --> 26:20.981
we will be right back

26:20.983 --> 26:22.986
with Alexa's weekend forecast.

26:24.355 --> 26:25.289
Are we...

26:26.223 --> 26:27.157
Should... Now?

26:28.392 --> 26:29.759
Great. Hey. Alexa...

26:29.761 --> 26:31.828
That was fun. I don't think
you're supposed to say asshole.

26:31.830 --> 26:34.062
- But that was fun.
- And we're out.

26:34.064 --> 26:36.197
Can I get that water?

26:36.199 --> 26:37.601
Um...

26:42.972 --> 26:46.876
Hey, I hope you like
smiley faces and pancakes.

26:47.711 --> 26:50.247
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

26:55.552 --> 26:57.555
Is it good?

27:06.129 --> 27:09.431
Yup. Okay. You, uh,
you enjoy your pancakes.

27:42.734 --> 27:44.535
Breakfast. Dancing.

Hey, Grace, do you know

28:17.233 --> 28:19.503
What are you doing?
I just got my groove going.

28:20.237 --> 28:22.404
What is wrong with us?

28:22.406 --> 28:24.072
Nothing.
Nothing's wrong with us.

28:24.074 --> 28:26.608
- No, we're being hilarious.
- I know.

28:35.451 --> 28:37.220
Hm. Stop it.

28:41.057 --> 28:42.958
No. Stop it.

28:42.960 --> 28:45.227
They're not here
so do what you want to.

28:45.229 --> 28:48.096
Ah, you're being mean to me now.
Now you're being mean to me.

28:48.098 --> 28:49.331
And I am letting you stay
in my house.

28:49.333 --> 28:50.799
You have to get away from me.

29:04.548 --> 29:05.682
Get off of me.

29:06.950 --> 29:09.486
Okay. Okay.

29:14.491 --> 29:15.726
It's too early.

29:17.027 --> 29:19.196
Just go in the corner.
You have my blessing.

29:20.664 --> 29:21.799
Okay, okay.

29:23.600 --> 29:24.635
Come on, man.

29:26.102 --> 29:27.869
Charlie, it's all the same.

29:27.871 --> 29:32.807
Every spot that you've sniffed
on this entire walk is the same.

29:32.809 --> 29:36.113
Just pick one
and then pee in it.

30:06.978 --> 30:10.046
Ugh, what?
What is it now, pizza boy?

30:10.048 --> 30:12.146
My name's Tyler. I...

30:12.148 --> 30:13.684
I just came to see
how you were feeling.

30:15.184 --> 30:17.854
Fine. Uh, totally fine.

30:19.121 --> 30:20.390
And Mabel?

30:22.826 --> 30:23.760
I wish I knew.

30:25.295 --> 30:26.928
I'm really sorry.

30:26.930 --> 30:28.263
I ought to call
that pizza place

30:28.265 --> 30:30.298
and tell 'em
not to hire twelve-year-olds.

30:30.300 --> 30:33.869
I was born in 2002, okay.
I'm 16 now.

30:33.871 --> 30:35.471
I said I was sorry.

30:37.808 --> 30:40.242
Okay. Why are you here?

30:42.144 --> 30:43.780
I wanna help you
find your dog.

30:58.194 --> 30:59.426
- Hi.
- Hi.

30:59.428 --> 31:01.563
- Um, Tara, right?
- Yeah.

31:01.565 --> 31:04.532
Uh, Dr. Mike said that
you might be stopping by.

31:04.534 --> 31:06.133
I'm Garrett,
from the coffee shop.

31:06.135 --> 31:08.269
- Yeah, Garrett, of course.
- Yeah. The usual?

31:08.271 --> 31:09.804
Oh, you get something
different every time.

31:09.806 --> 31:11.306
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

31:11.308 --> 31:12.941
Are you a volunteer?

31:12.943 --> 31:14.609
Oh, well, I'm a little bit more
than a volunteer.

31:14.611 --> 31:16.678
- I sort of run New Tricks. Um...
- Oh.

31:16.680 --> 31:18.413
I'm the director. So...

31:18.415 --> 31:19.949
Now I feel like
I'm just being braggy.

31:19.951 --> 31:21.416
No, no, it's awesome.

31:21.418 --> 31:23.885
Thanks. Yeah, well, we try
and keep it nice for these guys.

31:23.887 --> 31:26.255
You know, some of them end up
staying for a long time.

31:27.256 --> 31:28.857
Do you wanna see Gertrude?

31:28.859 --> 31:30.025
Gertrude?

31:30.027 --> 31:32.027
- Gertrude!
- Hi, girl!

31:32.029 --> 31:34.629
Hi, girl. You look amazing!

31:34.631 --> 31:36.931
- Why Gertrude?
- After Gertrude Stein.

31:36.933 --> 31:37.932
- Oh.
- Yeah.

31:37.934 --> 31:39.300
I love Gertrude Stein.

31:39.302 --> 31:40.869
Yeah, no, I know,
I-I always see you reading her

31:40.871 --> 31:42.205
at the coffee shop.

31:44.508 --> 31:46.708
Anyway, um,
let's break her out of there.

31:47.744 --> 31:49.811
Oh, hi.

31:49.813 --> 31:51.713
What happens
if she doesn't get adopted?

31:51.715 --> 31:54.051
Oh, no, no. We'll... we'll
keep her here till she does.

31:54.818 --> 31:57.052
- Now she's a really good girl.
- Hey.

31:57.054 --> 31:59.087
She just needs a little love.

31:59.089 --> 32:00.055
That's my girl.

32:01.258 --> 32:04.426
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you</i>

32:04.428 --> 32:08.563
<i>♪ Happy birthday dear Sammy</i>

32:08.565 --> 32:12.232
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you</i>

32:17.373 --> 32:20.274
- Do you think I'm ridiculous?
- In what context?

32:20.276 --> 32:22.209
Throwing a party for my dog?

32:22.211 --> 32:24.579
No. I went to a doggie wedding
last weekend.

32:24.581 --> 32:27.749
And it was, like,
surprisingly emotional.

32:29.053 --> 32:31.954
I would say that bouncy house
is a little over the top.

32:33.958 --> 32:35.289
Sam's just been so down.

32:35.291 --> 32:37.659
I thought this party
would cheer him up.

32:37.661 --> 32:39.661
I mean, he looks
pretty happy right now.

32:41.732 --> 32:43.265
Whose dog is that?

32:44.000 --> 32:46.334
Hi. Look at this.

32:46.336 --> 32:48.770
Oh, whose dog are you?

32:48.772 --> 32:50.172
Brandy.

32:51.408 --> 32:53.175
- It's Jimmy.
- Oh, no.

32:53.177 --> 32:55.744
Hey.
What are you doing here?

32:55.746 --> 32:56.778
Hi.

32:56.780 --> 32:57.947
- Hi.
- Jimmy.

32:57.949 --> 32:59.013
- Hi, Jimmy.
- There she is.

32:59.015 --> 33:00.614
It's Amy. Hi.

33:00.616 --> 33:03.283
I don't know if you remember me.
I did your make-up last week.

33:03.285 --> 33:06.388
Not that you need it.
Such a good face and body.

33:07.323 --> 33:10.125
- Thank you. Uh, Elizabeth.
- Jimmy.

33:10.127 --> 33:11.192
Almost don't recognize you

33:11.194 --> 33:12.460
without steam coming
out your ears.

33:12.462 --> 33:14.696
- Very funny.
- No cards in your hand.

33:14.698 --> 33:15.730
Who's this?

33:15.732 --> 33:18.433
It's my main squeeze Brandy
right here.

33:18.435 --> 33:19.902
Go ahead, Brand.

33:19.904 --> 33:21.170
- Oh.
- Ah.

33:21.172 --> 33:22.369
- Oh, my.
- She's getting up there,

33:22.371 --> 33:23.470
but she's still got it.

33:23.472 --> 33:24.873
Look at them.

33:24.875 --> 33:26.775
This is unbelievable.

33:27.677 --> 33:28.943
You never seen dogs
play before?

33:28.945 --> 33:30.612
Of course
I have. It's just that

33:30.614 --> 33:33.248
Sam's been so depressed lately,
and look at him now.

33:33.250 --> 33:35.416
Hm. Hey, what's wrong
with you, girl?

33:35.418 --> 33:37.085
He bothering you?

33:37.087 --> 33:39.754
Ugh, guys are just
the worst.

33:39.756 --> 33:42.692
Finally something we agree on.

33:45.295 --> 33:47.097
Did you always know
you wanted to do this?

33:47.931 --> 33:50.999
Well, uh, my parents
fought a lot when I was a kid.

33:51.001 --> 33:53.601
And, uh, my dog's the one
who really got me through it.

33:53.603 --> 33:56.204
So I saved up
and three years ago,

33:56.206 --> 33:58.708
I had enough to, uh,
to open this place.

33:59.476 --> 34:01.509
Man, I wish my work mattered.

34:01.511 --> 34:02.977
Your work does matter.

34:02.979 --> 34:05.814
I sell people an over-priced,
legally addictive substance.

34:05.816 --> 34:08.884
Or you brighten up
people's mornings.

34:08.886 --> 34:09.853
Your work matters.

34:10.786 --> 34:11.953
Thanks.

34:11.955 --> 34:13.320
- ...for stopping by, you know.
- Yeah. Of course.

34:13.322 --> 34:15.223
I hope you had
a good time and...

34:15.225 --> 34:16.257
- I was gonna ask.
- Yeah.

34:16.259 --> 34:18.059
Would it be possible to, like,

34:18.061 --> 34:19.092
um, volunteer...

34:19.094 --> 34:20.762
Yes.

34:20.764 --> 34:22.597
Yes. Um...

34:22.599 --> 34:23.965
Yeah.

34:23.967 --> 34:25.266
- Yeah?
- Yes.

34:25.268 --> 34:27.034
But if you want to,
and-and there's no pressure.

34:27.036 --> 34:29.637
Um, but we're just glad
to have volunteers whenever,

34:29.639 --> 34:31.172
you know, especially
when they're you.

34:31.175 --> 34:33.373
- I am so excited.
- I'm so excited.

34:33.376 --> 34:34.876
And I just can't hide it.

34:34.878 --> 34:37.411
I'm about to lose control,
and I think I like it.

34:37.413 --> 34:38.847
- Okay. Great.
- Okay.

34:38.849 --> 34:40.849
- Well, bye, Gertrude.
- Say bye.

34:40.851 --> 34:42.217
- I'll see you soon.
- Okay, but...

34:42.219 --> 34:43.685
You can leave
your number if you want.

34:43.687 --> 34:45.853
- I'm sorry, what?
- Do you wanna leave your number?

34:45.856 --> 34:46.754
- Oh.
- Just in case.

34:46.755 --> 34:48.656
- Um... just stop by.
- Um...

34:48.658 --> 34:49.657
- Okay, great.
- Okay.

34:49.659 --> 34:50.891
I hope to see you soon.

34:50.893 --> 34:51.995
And, just, um...

34:53.063 --> 34:55.866
make sure that y-y-you
take care of yourself

34:56.600 --> 34:59.834
and, um, if you need, uh,
if you need anything,

34:59.836 --> 35:01.970
I'm here.
This is where I work.

35:01.972 --> 35:04.239
- I know your spot. Okay.
- Okay. Cool, cool.

35:04.241 --> 35:05.809
- Bye.
- Gee, um...

35:09.212 --> 35:10.445
- I lost it. It was there.
- Lost it?

35:10.447 --> 35:11.880
- And then it went. So...
- It's okay.

35:11.882 --> 35:12.947
Okay.

35:12.949 --> 35:14.918
Bye, Gertrude. Bye.

35:15.952 --> 35:19.420
On a scale of one to ten,
just how... how bad was that?

35:20.857 --> 35:22.190
Ten?

35:22.192 --> 35:23.559
Gertrude, it wasn't that bad.

35:24.426 --> 35:26.861
<i>Hey, everybody, we
are looking at gorgeous weather</i>

35:26.863 --> 35:29.529
<i>coming up just in time
for July 4th.</i>

35:29.531 --> 35:31.799
Really nice for a walk
out in the park

35:31.801 --> 35:34.669
if you live near a park.
I certainly don't.

35:34.671 --> 35:37.705
I live in a large
21-unit concrete building.

35:37.707 --> 35:39.341
Sometimes
I think to myself,

35:39.343 --> 35:40.942
"Wouldn't it be nice
to have a yard?"

35:40.944 --> 35:41.876
It sure would.

35:41.878 --> 35:44.646
<i>Especially during
barbecue season.</i>

35:44.648 --> 35:46.813
<i>I sure wish
I had a barbecue to go to.</i>

35:46.815 --> 35:51.085
<i>Turns out, Independence Day
is truly a day of being alone.</i>

35:51.087 --> 35:54.289
<i>Anyway, you can see
that the coastal region...</i>

35:56.893 --> 35:59.060
Look, it doesn't come from me,
it comes from upstairs,

35:59.062 --> 36:00.228
but I can't say I disagree.

36:00.230 --> 36:01.663
A co-host?

36:01.665 --> 36:04.233
Why would you hire me a co-host?
I-I'm a lone wolf.

36:04.235 --> 36:05.833
Okay, look, you are a pro.

36:05.835 --> 36:08.137
It's just that sometimes
you can be a little uptight.

36:08.139 --> 36:09.704
I am not uptight.

36:09.706 --> 36:11.105
Look, I would never ask

36:11.107 --> 36:12.941
for an employee to show up
a little drunk.

36:12.943 --> 36:15.475
But sometimes I do get the urge
to ask you to do that.

36:15.477 --> 36:16.978
Fine. Then get me a bottle.

36:16.980 --> 36:18.880
Can somebody get me
a bottle of schnapps?

36:18.882 --> 36:20.915
Nobody wants schnapps!
She's kidding.

36:20.917 --> 36:22.917
- I'll get drunk right now.
- Listen.

36:22.919 --> 36:25.853
I know that you are trying
to be more loose.

36:25.855 --> 36:27.488
I mean, the other morning,
during that interview,

36:27.490 --> 36:28.823
it's the loosest
I've ever seen you.

36:28.825 --> 36:30.925
- It was amazing.
- Thank you.

36:30.927 --> 36:33.195
- Wait. Which interview?
- Whoo!

36:33.197 --> 36:35.595
Wake up, LA.

36:35.597 --> 36:37.398
- No.
- Just came to say good morning.

36:37.400 --> 36:38.598
- Good morning.
- Jimmy.

36:38.600 --> 36:40.335
Look at this.
The whole team is here.

36:40.337 --> 36:41.970
Myra, put your hands up.

36:41.972 --> 36:42.904
All right.

36:42.906 --> 36:43.974
I'm sorry.

36:44.975 --> 36:47.141
Oh. She didn't know.

36:47.143 --> 36:48.876
Our interview was a disaster.

36:48.878 --> 36:50.878
Yes, a disaster that got
more hits than anything

36:50.880 --> 36:52.680
from any of your shows
that we have ever posted.

36:52.682 --> 36:54.383
See, that's the problem.

36:54.385 --> 36:56.251
Nobody cares about
serious journalism anymore.

36:56.253 --> 36:57.884
Serious... Is that what this is?
Serious journalism?

36:57.886 --> 36:59.619
This tackle dummy
doesn't know anything

36:59.621 --> 37:01.122
about hosting
a morning news show.

37:01.124 --> 37:03.091
Whoa! "Tackle dummy?"
Now... now we're name-calling?

37:03.093 --> 37:04.558
Look, first of all,
save that for the show.

37:04.560 --> 37:06.493
The audience loves
you two together.

37:06.495 --> 37:08.396
They really do,
so you are going to have

37:08.398 --> 37:09.897
to make it work.

37:09.899 --> 37:12.202
Very good. Thank you. Goodbye.

37:15.972 --> 37:18.106
- Is she... is she gonna look up?
- No.

37:18.108 --> 37:20.211
Once her eyes go down,
they don't come back up.

37:25.647 --> 37:27.348
I mean, that's impressive.

37:31.621 --> 37:32.756
What is that?

37:36.359 --> 37:39.660
Oh! Oh! God! Charlie.

37:49.772 --> 37:52.541
Just pee anywhere!

37:53.510 --> 37:54.842
<i>Come on, you're only there</i>

37:54.844 --> 37:56.778
<i>to get more face-time
with hot vet.</i>

37:56.780 --> 37:59.047
<i>Not true. He's barely here.</i>

37:59.049 --> 38:02.216
<i>And when he is here, he's
checking out the dogs, not me.</i>

38:02.218 --> 38:03.851
<i>Anyway, what are you up to?</i>

38:03.853 --> 38:05.019
<i>I'm with a client.</i>

38:05.021 --> 38:06.488
<i>You should see
his owner's house.</i>

38:06.490 --> 38:08.022
<i>This place is bananas.</i>

38:08.024 --> 38:10.525
<i>I can't believe
people would just let you</i>

38:10.527 --> 38:12.060
<i>into their house like that.</i>

38:12.062 --> 38:14.195
<i>Walking someone's dog
is a very intimate thing.</i>

38:14.197 --> 38:15.797
<i>We create a special bond.</i>

38:15.799 --> 38:17.631
Like, the owner
of the house I'm at,

38:17.633 --> 38:19.801
he is my soulmate.

38:19.803 --> 38:22.170
We have the same taste
in movies,

38:22.172 --> 38:24.540
TV shows, bath products.

38:24.542 --> 38:27.509
Okay, just as long
as you're not being creepy.

38:27.511 --> 38:28.745
I'm not.

38:29.579 --> 38:30.945
Twelve minutes
to show, everyone.

38:30.947 --> 38:32.448
He is kind of cute, though.

38:32.450 --> 38:34.449
- Who?
- Jimmy.

38:34.451 --> 38:37.351
I like his shoulders...
and his legs...

38:37.353 --> 38:38.553
and his face and his neck.

38:38.555 --> 38:39.887
- You're into necks?
- Oh, yeah.

38:39.889 --> 38:42.723
I love necks, they're like
the abs of the head.

38:42.725 --> 38:45.493
- Ooh, good morning, Amy.
- Good morning, Jimmy.

38:45.495 --> 38:46.828
You gotta make sure
I look awake, okay?

38:46.830 --> 38:48.965
- I'll be your cup of coffee.
- Uh-oh.

38:50.133 --> 38:51.400
Good morning, Liz.

38:51.402 --> 38:52.902
Jimmy.

38:55.105 --> 38:57.739
You know, I had no idea that you
weren't consulted, by the way.

38:58.907 --> 39:01.777
So... maybe a fresh start?

39:02.545 --> 39:03.847
Fresh.

39:05.115 --> 39:07.415
Sorry, I'm very into
this conversation.

39:07.417 --> 39:08.384
Yeah.

39:10.019 --> 39:10.954
Fine.

39:11.955 --> 39:12.954
Fresh.

39:12.956 --> 39:14.722
Oh, by the way,
I meant tell you that,

39:14.724 --> 39:19.261
uh, Brandy has been talking
non-stop about Sam.

39:19.263 --> 39:21.096
- Yeah, it's cra-craziest thing.
- Oh, really?

39:21.098 --> 39:22.796
Didn't even know
she could talk. Yeah.

39:22.798 --> 39:25.133
So I figured we should probably
get them back together.

39:25.135 --> 39:26.766
Uh, maybe, uh...

39:26.768 --> 39:28.238
maybe Saturday.

39:29.606 --> 39:31.873
I don't, uh...
I don't think that...

39:31.875 --> 39:32.807
Ow!

39:32.809 --> 39:34.244
You had a big piece of lint.

39:35.078 --> 39:36.512
What are you doing?

39:36.514 --> 39:38.181
The lint is being stupid.

39:42.419 --> 39:43.519
I think Sam would enjoy that.

39:43.521 --> 39:44.785
- Yeah?
- Mm.

39:44.787 --> 39:46.521
Well, then, it is a date.

39:46.523 --> 39:48.788
- It's a dog date.
- It's a dog date.

39:58.935 --> 40:00.403
Do you think she's having fun?

40:01.438 --> 40:05.008
I don't know, it's hard to tell.
She's got a good poker face.

40:09.113 --> 40:10.911
I think we should just
grab some of these kids

40:10.913 --> 40:12.315
and bring them over
to play with her.

40:13.583 --> 40:15.316
I don't think
we should grab any kids.

40:15.318 --> 40:18.687
Not grab, like, lure.
With candy or something.

40:19.622 --> 40:21.389
Does that...
does that sound creepy?

40:21.391 --> 40:22.890
Yeah, it sounds super creepy.

40:22.892 --> 40:25.059
It sounds criminal, sounds
you're talking like a criminal.

40:25.061 --> 40:26.928
I-I just want her
to be happy.

40:26.930 --> 40:29.433
Well, me, too.
She will. She will.

40:33.769 --> 40:35.003
My God, where did she go?

40:35.737 --> 40:38.039
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Honey.
- She's okay.

40:38.041 --> 40:39.607
It's okay, it's okay.
Don't panic.

40:39.609 --> 40:42.109
- She was right here.
- Amelia! Amelia!

40:42.111 --> 40:43.411
Did you guys see
a-a-a little girl?

40:43.413 --> 40:45.046
- She was, like, playing ou...
- No. I'm sorry.

40:45.048 --> 40:47.515
Have you seen a little girl?
She has, uh, brown hair?

40:49.152 --> 40:50.086
Amelia!

40:51.721 --> 40:53.322
- Amelia!
- Amelia!

40:53.324 --> 40:54.121
Amelia, where are you?

40:54.123 --> 40:55.856
- I love you.
- Uh, Grace.

40:55.858 --> 40:57.359
- What?
- I love you...

40:58.528 --> 41:01.464
Oh. A doggie?

41:02.398 --> 41:05.566
Oh! Well, let me see you.

41:05.568 --> 41:08.336
Hi, are you lost, pumpkin?

41:08.338 --> 41:11.272
Hi. Hi.

41:11.274 --> 41:12.742
Hi, pumpkin.

41:16.714 --> 41:18.413
Can we keep her?

41:18.415 --> 41:19.350
Oh.

41:20.284 --> 41:23.016
- Uh, oh.
- Oh. Uh...

41:23.018 --> 41:25.686
First, we plaster this
bad boy all around the city.

41:25.688 --> 41:27.856
Then we take it
to shelters and rescues.

41:29.158 --> 41:30.360
Come on. Hop on.

41:33.329 --> 41:34.897
Are you out of your mind?

41:35.965 --> 41:38.299
Oh, look.
You got a baby Transformer.

41:38.301 --> 41:39.369
Wise guy.

41:40.404 --> 41:42.136
Slow down.

41:42.138 --> 41:43.605
I don't wanna get arrested
for letting

41:43.607 --> 41:45.307
a toddler drive my car.

41:45.309 --> 41:46.607
I have my learner's permit.

41:46.609 --> 41:47.943
This is totally legal.

41:48.711 --> 41:50.044
So where do you want me
to put these?

41:50.046 --> 41:52.148
Oh, just in my backpack.
That'd be great.

41:52.882 --> 41:55.349
Oh, pizza boy reads.

41:55.351 --> 41:57.719
I take it this is
assigned reading.

41:57.721 --> 41:59.453
Yeah, yeah,
for summer school.

41:59.455 --> 42:02.423
"A man who has gone
through bitter experiences

42:02.425 --> 42:03.759
"and travels far,

42:03.761 --> 42:06.428
enjoys even his sufferings
after a time."

42:07.631 --> 42:08.931
Definitely suffering
through that book.

42:09.666 --> 42:11.064
My teacher,
Mr. Chapman, suggested

42:11.066 --> 42:12.667
that I should get,
uh, some tutoring,

42:12.669 --> 42:14.602
but my mom says

42:14.604 --> 42:15.904
we don't have the money.

42:17.206 --> 42:20.243
For many years, I was
an English professor at UCLA.

42:20.977 --> 42:22.778
That's where I met my wife.

42:22.780 --> 42:24.011
Oh, cool.

42:24.013 --> 42:26.249
- Uh, she still teach there or...
- No.

42:26.983 --> 42:29.384
She passed two years ago
this November.

42:29.386 --> 42:31.819
Oh. I'm so sorry.

42:31.821 --> 42:33.688
This was her car, you know.

42:33.690 --> 42:35.922
Ah! Of course.

42:35.924 --> 42:38.261
I didn't think you really
picked this bad boy out.

42:39.128 --> 42:42.065
She was a great teacher.
Taught me a lot.

42:46.737 --> 42:48.938
My dad died when I was 12.
So...

42:49.939 --> 42:51.207
I totally get it.

42:52.342 --> 42:55.510
There's a lot of times I wish
he was still here, you know.

42:55.512 --> 42:56.580
Give me advice and stuff.

42:57.314 --> 42:59.747
Maybe, uh, I'd ask him
how to suggest to someone

42:59.749 --> 43:01.150
that they should get a new car.

43:02.017 --> 43:03.386
Maybe one
that's not yellow.

43:04.120 --> 43:07.054
And I might ask him if he
taught his son to be a wise guy

43:07.056 --> 43:08.656
or does it just
come naturally.

43:14.330 --> 43:16.165
I could help you
with your studies.

43:17.033 --> 43:19.133
Yeah, yeah, that'd be...
that'd be amazing,

43:19.135 --> 43:23.036
but, uh, I don't have
the money to do that.

43:23.038 --> 43:25.040
No, I'm not askin'
for your cash.

43:26.209 --> 43:27.708
Perhaps, if you come
a little early,

43:27.710 --> 43:29.944
before we go look for Mabel,

43:29.946 --> 43:32.982
we'll see if we can help you
get it a little more.

43:33.716 --> 43:35.883
- You sure?
- Sure.

43:35.885 --> 43:37.053
Thank you.

43:38.154 --> 43:39.088
Yeah.

43:41.725 --> 43:42.923
Any luck?

43:42.925 --> 43:44.125
No. You?

43:44.127 --> 43:45.128
No.

43:48.831 --> 43:50.865
- Okay. Okay.
- Whoo!

43:50.867 --> 43:53.000
- We'll take her home tonight for safekeeping.
- Yay!

43:53.002 --> 43:54.502
Okay, we gotta look for...

43:54.504 --> 43:56.370
- This is just temporary.
- Yeah, I know. Temporary.

43:56.372 --> 43:59.507
- That's it. Good.
- Yeah, temp. T-E-M-P.

43:59.509 --> 44:01.909
Oh, honey,
she is really overweight.

44:01.911 --> 44:05.212
Yeah, there's a lot
of her to love. Mm-hmm.

44:05.214 --> 44:07.783
Maybe we can take her on walks?

44:07.785 --> 44:10.851
- Oh! That's a great idea.
- Yeah, that's a great idea.

44:10.853 --> 44:12.520
We can take her on a walk.

44:12.522 --> 44:14.190
Do you wanna be my roommate?

44:16.092 --> 44:17.593
What's your favorite animal?

44:18.961 --> 44:21.195
Lions? Yeah, maybe lions.

44:21.197 --> 44:24.098
My favorite is doggies,
of course.

44:24.100 --> 44:27.069
What's your second
favorite animal?

44:27.805 --> 44:29.270
Hm...

44:29.272 --> 44:31.773
I think you like zebras,
of course,

44:31.775 --> 44:33.176
'cause they're white and black.

44:33.910 --> 44:37.278
My third favorite,
um, let's see, bears.

44:37.280 --> 44:40.947
I love bears.
They're my favorite.

44:40.949 --> 44:43.317
But you're cuter than bears.

44:43.319 --> 44:45.555
Oh. We're gonna keep this dog.

44:46.956 --> 44:48.622
I know, I know,
I mean, after we try

44:48.624 --> 44:50.057
- to find the owners.
- Right.

44:50.059 --> 44:51.760
- Yeah.
- Right.

44:51.762 --> 44:53.329
You should be my best friend.

44:54.263 --> 44:55.231
And a fry.

44:55.965 --> 44:58.332
Yeah. Do you like IPAs?

44:58.334 --> 45:00.099
Me, either,
but if I don't order them,

45:00.101 --> 45:02.536
I feel like I'm not recycling
or something.

45:02.538 --> 45:05.072
This is kind of fun, huh,
eating fries, drinking beer?

45:08.511 --> 45:11.113
Don't tell my sister
I gave you people food, okay.

45:12.850 --> 45:15.251
Hey, Dax. How are your wings?

45:16.118 --> 45:17.588
Well, Kelli,
the wings were hot.

45:20.557 --> 45:22.055
Cool.

45:22.057 --> 45:24.460
Like, seriously hot,
burned my mouth.

45:26.896 --> 45:29.065
So why'd you name
your band Frunk?

45:30.566 --> 45:34.201
Well, because
it can mean anything.

45:34.203 --> 45:37.473
- Oh, dope.
- Yeah, dope.

45:41.377 --> 45:42.611
- Okay, um...
- Oh, hello.

45:42.613 --> 45:43.778
Charlie, Charlie.

45:43.780 --> 45:44.746
Hi, puppy.

45:44.748 --> 45:46.279
Charlie. Please.

45:46.281 --> 45:48.081
- So, so...
- That's okay.

45:48.083 --> 45:49.850
- So, so sorry.
- He's cute.

45:49.852 --> 45:52.853
I'm watching my sister's dog.
She's in the hospital.

45:52.855 --> 45:54.722
Well, that's so nice of you.

45:54.724 --> 45:56.492
Well, he's family.

45:59.729 --> 46:01.997
Oh, Charlie, Charlie. Sorry.
I'm so... No, no. I'm so sorry.

46:01.999 --> 46:03.297
- Off...
- It's all right.

46:03.299 --> 46:05.700
Down. Charlie, down.
Down. Yeah.

46:05.702 --> 46:08.537
He doesn't deal well with
other people getting attention.

46:08.539 --> 46:09.772
Charlie, come on, man.

46:16.712 --> 46:18.013
Where were we?

46:18.015 --> 46:20.147
- Oh, I don't remember.
- Hm.

46:20.149 --> 46:21.749
Charlie.

46:23.052 --> 46:24.652
Charlie, you're gonna
get me kicked out of here.

46:24.654 --> 46:28.291
I'm so sorry about the dog.

46:29.325 --> 46:32.694
Yeah, just feel like maybe
now is not the right time.

46:34.129 --> 46:36.797
Uh, we could...
we could go to your place.

46:36.799 --> 46:38.367
I live with my boyfriend.

46:39.735 --> 46:41.270
Oh.

46:44.007 --> 46:46.709
Sam is a completely
different dog around Brandy.

46:47.643 --> 46:50.477
- He's just so happy.
- You know what they say.

46:50.479 --> 46:52.546
Animals are a direct reflection
of their owners.

46:52.548 --> 46:54.883
Oh, yeah. You know
what? I can totally see it.

46:54.885 --> 46:57.183
Is Brandy desperate
to find a second career, too?

46:57.185 --> 46:59.520
Okay, well, let me ask you.

46:59.522 --> 47:01.889
When you get your hair done,
do you take a picture in of Sam

47:01.891 --> 47:03.122
and go, "Do this?"

47:03.124 --> 47:05.259
Yes, actually.

47:05.261 --> 47:07.963
- Do you?
- I am flattered that you noticed.

47:07.965 --> 47:10.264
Can you see it? Twins.

47:10.266 --> 47:12.633
My mind is blown. I can't...
I can't tell who's who.

47:14.236 --> 47:16.037
Uh, this is me
and Brandy's spot.

47:16.039 --> 47:17.841
- Isn't that right, girl?
- Good job, Eddie.

47:18.609 --> 47:20.775
- Honey, not so far out.
- Wow, so many kids out here.

47:20.777 --> 47:22.443
All my friends
are having kids right now.

47:22.445 --> 47:24.612
My whole family...
ask me all the time

47:24.614 --> 47:25.879
what the hold-up is.

47:25.881 --> 47:27.348
Yeah, what is the hold-up?

47:27.350 --> 47:29.249
- What's wrong with you?
- Well...

47:29.251 --> 47:30.618
- What's wrong with me?
- Mm.

47:30.620 --> 47:33.489
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

47:34.256 --> 47:35.591
Nothing is wrong with me.

47:36.525 --> 47:39.161
Just had
a cheating ex-boyfriend.

47:43.767 --> 47:44.901
I'm sorry.

47:46.201 --> 47:47.534
Thank you.

47:48.671 --> 47:50.539
But seriously,
what's wrong with you?

47:51.941 --> 47:53.309
Already? You see what...

47:54.176 --> 47:55.511
Playing ball.

47:56.947 --> 47:58.812
You know how it is.

47:58.814 --> 48:00.514
Never planted my feet.

48:00.516 --> 48:02.282
Guess you could say
the most significant woman

48:02.284 --> 48:04.420
in my life has been Brandy.

48:05.287 --> 48:09.288
But... little more settled now.

48:09.290 --> 48:11.192
So I think
I'll give it another try.

48:13.729 --> 48:16.298
It's hard to compete
with a lady like Brandy.

48:19.468 --> 48:22.169
This is still
just a dog date, right?

48:22.171 --> 48:25.608
Yes. Still just a dog date.

48:33.248 --> 48:34.750
Okay. Yeah.

48:35.618 --> 48:39.386
Charlie, I know there is a good
guy deep down there somewhere,

48:39.388 --> 48:42.391
but I can't say that I am
not excited to get my life back.

48:44.927 --> 48:47.028
Hey, there he is.

48:47.030 --> 48:48.662
- Oh, wow!
- Daddy.

48:48.664 --> 48:51.198
- Hey. I'm a dad.
- Hi. How are you?

48:51.200 --> 48:53.536
- I'm a dad...
- Yeah.

48:54.604 --> 48:57.370
- Are... are you okay?
- Yeah.

48:57.372 --> 48:59.973
I'm grea... I've never been
happier in my whole life.

48:59.975 --> 49:02.241
Okay, so let's get you
Purell, huh?

49:02.243 --> 49:05.212
- I'm two peoples' dad. Ha-ha.
- Oh.

49:05.214 --> 49:06.780
Just scary when you think
about it, but when you

49:06.782 --> 49:08.415
don't think about it,
well, it's just the same.

49:08.417 --> 49:09.984
It's just,
everything's the same. Sorry.

49:09.986 --> 49:11.218
Just gotta get you
super clean.

49:11.220 --> 49:13.021
So keep your voice
real, real super quiet.

49:13.023 --> 49:14.189
- Okay.
- Hospital clean.

49:14.191 --> 49:15.790
That's what she says.
Hospital clean.

49:15.792 --> 49:19.761
And, uh, don't say anything
about her ankles, okay.

49:19.763 --> 49:22.361
- Her ankles?
- Yeah, they're full of baby water.

49:22.363 --> 49:25.367
I guess it's normal,
but it looks disgusting.

49:27.470 --> 49:29.204
Let's get ready to be an uncle!

49:30.906 --> 49:33.108
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
I'm sorry.

49:33.110 --> 49:36.343
- Shh! Shh!
- Okay, I got it.

49:36.345 --> 49:38.913
What's wrong with you? Shh.

49:38.915 --> 49:41.683
I gotta tell you, I think
you guys' shushes are louder

49:41.685 --> 49:43.383
than the volume
of my voice right now.

49:47.123 --> 49:50.390
Oh, no. Let's keep looking.

49:50.392 --> 49:52.361
- Thank you.
- Oh, of course.

49:53.529 --> 49:55.397
- Thanks.
- Yeah, totally.

49:56.432 --> 49:58.332
Yeah, I'll let you know
if we get any more pugs in.

49:58.334 --> 49:59.900
- Okay, yeah. See you.
- Bye.

49:59.902 --> 50:02.302
Well, I-I-I know,
I understand.

50:02.304 --> 50:05.405
I just, I wanna do
as much as I can, I mean...

50:05.407 --> 50:08.475
Okay. All right, thank you.

50:08.477 --> 50:13.113
Thank you for nothing,
you terrible lawyer. I don't...

50:13.115 --> 50:14.416
- Hey.
- Hey.

50:15.184 --> 50:17.384
- You're there. Hi.
- I am.

50:17.386 --> 50:18.888
What's going on?

50:20.356 --> 50:23.325
Our landlord just sold
the building out from under us.

50:24.527 --> 50:26.662
- He can do that?
- He just did.

50:28.564 --> 50:31.701
Okay, so then,
we'll just find another place.

50:32.968 --> 50:34.637
That sounds great,

50:35.403 --> 50:37.504
but I don't have
any money to do that.

50:37.506 --> 50:40.442
I put every single cent
that I have into this place.

50:41.677 --> 50:44.279
Okay, so then,
we'll just raise it.

50:44.281 --> 50:46.446
I mean,
how about a fundraiser?

50:46.448 --> 50:48.950
Uh, we could get the food
and the drinks donated.

50:48.952 --> 50:52.386
Raffle off prizes,
make it a real event, you know.

50:52.388 --> 50:55.355
Oh, my God. I am totally
getting ahead of myself.

50:55.357 --> 50:57.558
You haven't even said
you want me to help out.

50:57.560 --> 50:59.593
I want you to help out.
Yes. Of course.

50:59.595 --> 51:01.395
- I want you to help out.
- Okay. Good.

51:01.397 --> 51:03.797
I am terrible
at throwing parties.

51:03.799 --> 51:07.334
My sixteenth birthday
was at Bed Bath & Beyond, so...

51:07.336 --> 51:09.469
- Wait, really?
- Uh, well, you know, it...

51:09.471 --> 51:11.805
It wasn't just
a Bed Bath & Beyond. I...

51:11.807 --> 51:13.540
We started
at Bed Bath & Beyond,

51:13.542 --> 51:14.976
and there was
sort of like a journey.

51:14.978 --> 51:16.044
You had your birthday party

51:16.046 --> 51:17.312
at Bed Bath & Beyond?

51:17.314 --> 51:18.612
Yeah, it was Bed Bath & Beyond,

51:18.614 --> 51:20.514
and beyond was a theme.
I was, I was...

51:20.516 --> 51:21.782
It was a phase
that I was going through

51:21.784 --> 51:23.584
where I just...
I thought it was super fun.

51:23.586 --> 51:25.319
It was actually,
it was actually a lot of fun.

51:25.321 --> 51:26.386
- No, no, it's great.
- You think it's weird?

51:26.388 --> 51:27.554
- It's great.
- Okay.

51:27.556 --> 51:29.223
We're gonna make
this happen, okay.

51:29.225 --> 51:31.358
- First we start with sponsors.
- Yes.

51:31.360 --> 51:34.928
Figure we could reach out to
dog-food companies, pet stores.

51:34.930 --> 51:36.797
And Bed Bath & Beyond.
We could try.

51:36.799 --> 51:38.398
We could try
for Bed Bath & Beyond.

51:38.400 --> 51:40.400
- I mean, we could even have media there.
- Yeah.

51:40.402 --> 51:42.502
Raise some public awareness
for New Tricks.

51:42.504 --> 51:44.772
Public awareness is
my favorite type of awareness.

51:44.774 --> 51:46.874
Well, lucky for you,
I'm pretty good at this.

51:46.876 --> 51:49.044

52:17.106 --> 52:18.741
Of course, they're Greg's.

52:19.575 --> 52:21.242
'Cause neither of them
look like Greg.

52:21.244 --> 52:22.645
Oh, my God.

52:23.445 --> 52:24.613
They're Greg's.

52:25.481 --> 52:27.483
Did they both come out
at the same time?

52:29.319 --> 52:30.752
- What?
- I just always wondered

52:30.754 --> 52:32.488
if twins came out like...

52:34.857 --> 52:36.223
Or, like, it's...

52:36.225 --> 52:39.259

I can't hold that one, too.

You know, it's just that, uh...

you're amazing.

No, it's not weird.

54:58.700 --> 55:00.467
It's not weird at all.

55:00.469 --> 55:01.501
It's really sweet.

55:02.805 --> 55:04.671
We make a really great team.

55:04.673 --> 55:05.908
Yeah, I think so, too.

55:08.177 --> 55:09.810
Okay, well, hey, Gertrude,
what do you think?

55:09.812 --> 55:11.812
Do you think
we should do beer over there?

55:11.814 --> 55:13.613
Beer and liquor?
You're a licker.

55:13.615 --> 55:15.085
You like licking things.

55:26.762 --> 55:28.529
Shut up. You hear me?

55:28.531 --> 55:29.863
Shut your mouth
and go outside

55:29.865 --> 55:31.698
or I will make you
live in here forever.

55:31.700 --> 55:32.935
Do you understand me?

55:39.675 --> 55:40.674
Look what you made me do.

55:40.676 --> 55:41.775
Hmm? Look what you made me do!

55:41.777 --> 55:42.709

55:52.054 --> 55:53.620
Sam has a onesie.

55:53.622 --> 55:55.222
And I'm sure
Sam looks great in it.

55:55.224 --> 55:57.023
- I'm gonna be over there.
- I'm gonna get one for Brandy.

55:57.025 --> 55:58.259
- Watch this.
- Oh, no. No, you won't.

55:58.261 --> 55:59.393
Ooh, look at this.

56:01.096 --> 56:03.397
Bella! Come here, girl.

56:03.399 --> 56:04.798
- Hey.
- Bella? Hey.

56:04.800 --> 56:06.434

- Hi.
- Oh.

56:24.119 --> 56:26.987
I almost didn't recognize you
with clothes on.

56:26.989 --> 56:28.688
Okay, you know what,
that's just mean.

56:28.690 --> 56:29.991
I-I'm mean?

56:29.993 --> 56:31.559
I moved on.
Please accept that.

56:31.561 --> 56:33.393
You moved on while we were
still together.

56:33.395 --> 56:35.061
You just don't want me to be
happy, that's what this is.

56:35.063 --> 56:38.198
Of course, I don't
want you to be happy.

56:39.101 --> 56:41.201
Look at this.
You've made Sam upset.

56:41.203 --> 56:43.236
Okay, this is ridiculous.
Sam is fine.

56:43.238 --> 56:44.804
You didn't even call him
on his birthday.

56:44.806 --> 56:46.973
He is a dog. He doesn't know
what a birthday is.

56:46.975 --> 56:48.276
Of course he knows
what a birthday is.

56:48.278 --> 56:50.710
- He's a very smart dog.
- Not that smart.

56:50.712 --> 56:52.812
Hey, in her defense,
some dogs are smart,

56:52.814 --> 56:54.215
some dogs are dumb.

56:54.217 --> 56:55.815
Okay. Yeah, well,
that's a dumb dog.

56:55.817 --> 56:58.220
Uh, hey, there's no need
for insults.

56:58.987 --> 57:01.188
Oh, snap. You're Jimmy Johnston.
'Sup, dude?

57:01.190 --> 57:02.689
You do not get
to shake his hand.

57:02.691 --> 57:04.457
- Hey, hey.
- Yeah, Jimmy is a big boy.

57:04.459 --> 57:06.693
I think he can decide if he
wants to shake my hand or not.

57:06.695 --> 57:08.563
Yeah, Jimmy's a big boy.
Yeah. What's your name?

57:08.565 --> 57:10.130
- Uh, Peter... Ow.
- Yeah.

57:10.132 --> 57:11.599
Oh, that's quite
a grip you got.

57:11.601 --> 57:12.832
I feel like you're about
to apologize to Liz.

57:12.834 --> 57:13.867
That... Is that...
Am I-am I wrong?

57:13.869 --> 57:15.403
No. Oh, God!

57:15.405 --> 57:16.903
Think I'm wrong. I think you're
about to apologize to her.

57:16.905 --> 57:18.606
- Are you taking a knee? Wow.
- Uh, yeah.

57:18.608 --> 57:21.041
Wow. So polite, so polite.

57:21.043 --> 57:22.542
Yeah, as you were saying?

57:22.544 --> 57:24.911
I'm... sorry.

57:24.913 --> 57:26.813
- Hmm?
- One more time?

57:26.815 --> 57:28.248
Elizabeth, I'm sorry.

57:28.250 --> 57:30.551
- What about Sam?
- What about... Oh, God.

57:30.553 --> 57:32.285
Uh, sorry, Sam, about that.

57:32.287 --> 57:34.020
And I mean, might as well,
you know, make it three.

57:34.022 --> 57:35.188
Why don't you go for Br...
That's Brandy.

57:35.190 --> 57:36.624
I didn't talk to...
I don't know Brandy.

57:36.626 --> 57:38.292
Ow! Sorry, Brandy.

57:38.294 --> 57:40.494
She says, "Nice
to meet you." All right, up.

57:40.496 --> 57:42.029
- God!
- Oh.

57:42.031 --> 57:44.067
Wow! Your hands are like
trash compactors.

57:45.234 --> 57:46.066
You guys heading out?

57:46.068 --> 57:47.901
- Yeah.
- Uh, yeah, we gotta...

57:47.903 --> 57:49.803
- We definitely gotta get out.
- We're gonna go.

57:49.805 --> 57:50.837
- It's so nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

57:50.839 --> 57:52.038
- See ya, guys.
- Yeah.

57:52.040 --> 57:54.307
It was super lovely
to see you again,

57:54.309 --> 57:55.842
and so nice to meet you.

57:55.844 --> 57:57.944
Just come on, please.

57:57.946 --> 57:59.781
- You took a picture.
- Oh, got it.

58:05.588 --> 58:06.522

58:08.191 --> 58:09.689
Liz?

58:09.691 --> 58:11.393
Liz, hey, a-are you okay?

58:17.734 --> 58:19.432
I just have one rule.

58:19.434 --> 58:21.036

58:21.770 --> 58:23.870
Yes, fine, okay.

59:21.930 --> 59:24.898

- Okay.

59:24.900 --> 59:27.067

Well, you're goin'
to be waiting a long time

01:01:20.149 --> 01:01:21.716
'cause no other shoe
is gonna drop.

01:01:23.051 --> 01:01:24.451

my last boyfriend...

01:01:24.453 --> 01:01:26.588
Who needs to get his head
checked for lettin' you go.

01:01:28.356 --> 01:01:30.358
Look, Liz, I promise you,
I'm not him.

01:01:32.227 --> 01:01:33.529
I'll never be that guy.

01:01:42.438 --> 01:01:45.772
Now, can we...
can we go to the car

01:01:45.774 --> 01:01:47.142
'cause I think a seagull...

01:01:47.876 --> 01:01:49.877
seagull got me
on my back, and, uh...

01:01:49.879 --> 01:01:53.246
- Oh, yup. It got you.
- So, it's...

01:01:53.248 --> 01:01:54.715

that can make that word

01:02:09.364 --> 01:02:11.064
Well, folks,
we are certainly

01:02:11.066 --> 01:02:13.066
in the dog days
of summer right now.

01:02:13.068 --> 01:02:15.401
Yes, it is gonna be
a hot, hot, hottie.

01:02:15.403 --> 01:02:18.271
Hey, I think my ex-boyfriend
used to call me that.

01:02:18.273 --> 01:02:19.775
Wanna weigh
in here, Tom?

01:02:20.776 --> 01:02:23.009
Tom. He's one
of our producers. My ex.

01:02:23.011 --> 01:02:25.546
It's cool. We're still friends.

01:02:25.548 --> 01:02:26.981
What happened?

01:02:26.983 --> 01:02:28.682
The heat wave's going
to my head.

01:02:28.684 --> 01:02:31.050
Anybody else?
No? Just me?

01:02:31.052 --> 01:02:33.386
Well, like I was saying...

01:02:33.388 --> 01:02:35.054
Give me them smooches.

01:02:35.056 --> 01:02:36.556
Give me that smooch.

01:02:36.558 --> 01:02:38.124
Give me that smooch.

01:02:38.126 --> 01:02:40.660
I need the smooches.
You're so sweet.

01:02:40.662 --> 01:02:42.832
You're the best dog
in the whole world. Mwah.

01:02:43.699 --> 01:02:46.332
So, I just got off the phone
with Channel 12.

01:02:46.334 --> 01:02:49.168
- And they're sending a reporter.
- Yeah?

01:02:49.170 --> 01:02:51.104
- You're serious?
- I am dead serious.

01:02:51.106 --> 01:02:53.139
- You're on fire.
- What can I say?

01:02:53.141 --> 01:02:55.676
- What, where did you come from?
- High fives?

01:02:55.678 --> 01:02:57.277
What's the occasion?

01:02:57.279 --> 01:03:00.647
Uh, no, just a-a small victory
for the New Tricks fundraiser.

01:03:00.649 --> 01:03:02.515
No, she's being humble.
You're killing it.

01:03:02.517 --> 01:03:05.019
- Stop. You are killing it.
- No, I... You're the killer.

01:03:05.021 --> 01:03:07.788
At most, I'm the getaway driver.
You know it.

01:03:07.790 --> 01:03:10.658
Okay, but none of this would be
happening in the first place...

01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:12.893
- I'd love to.
- What?

01:03:12.895 --> 01:03:15.596
I'd love to help sponsor
the event, is what I mean.

01:03:15.598 --> 01:03:17.998
- I want in.
- Really?

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.099
I mean, that is so generous.

01:03:20.101 --> 01:03:21.701
Oh, it's totally my pleasure.

01:03:21.703 --> 01:03:23.538
I've got goo gobs of money.

01:03:24.472 --> 01:03:26.606
Geez, how am I
gonna find a date?

01:03:26.608 --> 01:03:31.244
Oh, I'm sure you, of all people,
have no problem finding one.

01:03:31.246 --> 01:03:34.282
Oh, is that so?
Are you volunteering?

01:03:35.751 --> 01:03:37.116
What?

01:03:38.654 --> 01:03:40.219
Oh, are you guys...

01:03:40.221 --> 01:03:42.121
Oh, no, no, no. We-we're
just friends, co-workers.

01:03:42.123 --> 01:03:45.558
Yeah. Eww, her?
No, thank you.

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:47.260
Um, I just... No.

01:03:47.262 --> 01:03:49.063
Oh, good. Phew.

01:03:49.065 --> 01:03:50.563
I don't want to step
on any toes.

01:03:50.565 --> 01:03:52.532
No toe...
I'm toeless, you know.

01:03:52.534 --> 01:03:56.036
I lack toes.
Lactose intolerant.

01:03:56.038 --> 01:03:58.504
So, um, this is awesome
that this is ha...

01:03:58.506 --> 01:04:01.976
You know, you're so awesome
and you're... super fit.

01:04:01.978 --> 01:04:05.579
Yeah, yeah, we could be like
a-a power couple, you know.

01:04:05.581 --> 01:04:10.316
You're the brains and I'm the
heart or the face or whatever.

01:04:10.318 --> 01:04:11.951
So I'll pick you up
Saturday at 6:00?

01:04:11.953 --> 01:04:13.620
- I will see you then.
- Great.

01:04:13.622 --> 01:04:14.789
Looking forward to it.

01:04:16.058 --> 01:04:17.626
- Oh, thanks, pal.
- Yup.

01:04:26.068 --> 01:04:27.735
So, we're gonna do Thai
for dinner, huh?

01:04:27.737 --> 01:04:28.769
You ever have Thai?

01:04:28.771 --> 01:04:29.903
I love Thai.

01:04:46.122 --> 01:04:47.420
Oh, it's just my band equipment,

01:04:47.422 --> 01:04:49.322
and I-I poked the holes
so that...

01:04:49.324 --> 01:04:51.125
'cause it gets smelly
after practice

01:04:51.127 --> 01:04:52.993
so I want it to air out.

01:04:52.995 --> 01:04:54.764
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

01:04:59.401 --> 01:05:00.667
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

01:05:00.669 --> 01:05:02.468
Oh, that's just my equipment
moving around.

01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:04.203
- Let them out. Let them out.
- Oh!

01:05:04.205 --> 01:05:06.372
I know you have someone
in there. Let them out!

01:05:06.374 --> 01:05:07.707
- Take it easy.
- I'm warning you. Let them out!

01:05:07.709 --> 01:05:09.208
Whatever you think
is happening is not...

01:05:09.210 --> 01:05:10.276
Let them...

01:05:10.278 --> 01:05:12.211
Oh, my... Oh!

01:05:12.213 --> 01:05:13.681
Help! Help, somebody!

01:05:13.683 --> 01:05:16.349
Ooh! I got to get out.

01:05:16.351 --> 01:05:17.953
I can't breathe.
I'm gonna puke.

01:05:18.888 --> 01:05:20.687
- I'm...
- Oh, my God!

01:05:21.723 --> 01:05:24.490
Help me! Somebody!

01:05:24.492 --> 01:05:27.161
Help me!

01:05:27.163 --> 01:05:29.863
- It's a dog!
- Help! Somebody! Help me!

01:05:29.865 --> 01:05:32.935
It's a dog. It's a dog.

01:05:34.937 --> 01:05:36.335
Oh, hi, puppy.

01:05:38.874 --> 01:05:39.809
Ow!

01:05:41.477 --> 01:05:44.077
I just feel like the universe
is constantly telling me

01:05:44.079 --> 01:05:45.445
I shouldn't be helping anybody.

01:05:45.447 --> 01:05:48.047
Oh, God! I am so sorry.

01:05:48.049 --> 01:05:49.651
Oh, God, it feels like...

01:05:50.885 --> 01:05:53.586
It feels like I opened
my eyes in a sandbox.

01:05:53.588 --> 01:05:56.357
I wish there was something I
could do to make it up to you.

01:05:57.292 --> 01:05:58.794
Yeah, hey, um...

01:06:00.162 --> 01:06:03.063
It's not, I guess,
the most ideal time,

01:06:03.065 --> 01:06:04.330
but w-would you maybe
wanna go out

01:06:04.332 --> 01:06:05.799
with me this weekend?

01:06:05.801 --> 01:06:08.735
That's really sweet, but I am
so swamped this weekend.

01:06:08.737 --> 01:06:12.405
I'm actually organizing a
fundraiser for this dog rescue.

01:06:12.407 --> 01:06:15.510
Oh, yeah? You need a band?

01:06:19.647 --> 01:06:21.614
He's really good at bowling,
which is important.

01:06:21.616 --> 01:06:23.984
Um, 'cause I think it means that
he's good at other things.

01:06:23.986 --> 01:06:25.485
- Mmm.
- Anyway, so what

01:06:25.487 --> 01:06:27.221
is happening
with you and...

01:06:28.924 --> 01:06:30.256
Yeah!

01:06:30.258 --> 01:06:32.391
Amy, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:06:32.393 --> 01:06:35.261
Stop. Everyone can tell
you two are in love.

01:06:35.263 --> 01:06:38.165
- It's really cute.
- I am a professional.

01:06:38.167 --> 01:06:39.832
- Mm-hmm.
- I would never date my co-host.

01:06:39.834 --> 01:06:42.602
Oh, yeah, sure, which is why
I was gonna ask you,

01:06:42.604 --> 01:06:45.671
what is gonna happen when
he moves over to Channel 12?

01:06:45.673 --> 01:06:47.540
What are you talking about?

01:06:47.542 --> 01:06:50.343
You and that sweet
little poker face.

01:06:50.345 --> 01:06:51.645
You know
the big offer he got

01:06:51.647 --> 01:06:53.682
to host his own morning show
on Channel 12?

01:06:56.017 --> 01:06:57.183
Oh!

01:06:57.185 --> 01:06:58.787
Five minutes to show, everyone.

01:06:59.554 --> 01:07:01.088
Oh, my God, you should have
heard Nina earlier.

01:07:01.090 --> 01:07:03.223
She was, like,
"I'm devastated."

01:07:03.225 --> 01:07:04.457
I saw her eat a donut.

01:07:04.459 --> 01:07:06.960
I was like,
"What? Who are you?"

01:07:06.962 --> 01:07:08.528
Yeah, I thought...
I thought about the Fiat,

01:07:08.530 --> 01:07:09.730
but I just feel like
I can't get enough people...

01:07:09.732 --> 01:07:10.831
Oh, it's a hell
of a great car.

01:07:10.833 --> 01:07:12.132
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:07:12.134 --> 01:07:13.867
Fifteen seconds, everyone.

01:07:13.869 --> 01:07:14.937
You look pretty.

01:07:18.373 --> 01:07:19.642
- Everything okay?
- Mm-hmm.

01:07:20.375 --> 01:07:21.574
- No, seriously...
- We're live...

01:07:21.576 --> 01:07:22.809
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- ...in five...

01:07:22.811 --> 01:07:24.244
- Yeah, I'm great.
- ...four, three...

01:07:24.246 --> 01:07:25.311
- You seem a little tense.
- ...two...

01:07:25.313 --> 01:07:27.880
- Good morning.
- Wake up, LA.

01:07:27.882 --> 01:07:30.483
- Who doesn't love clowns?
- Got to be some people.

01:07:30.485 --> 01:07:32.518
- What?
- I'm just saying like, so not...

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:34.453
I mean, clowns have to creep
some people out.

01:07:34.455 --> 01:07:36.023
- But not me, I love them.
- Okay.

01:07:36.025 --> 01:07:38.158
Well, I certainly love clowns.

01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:40.459
And lucky for us,
or maybe just me,

01:07:40.461 --> 01:07:42.663
we have a live clown here
with us today.

01:07:42.665 --> 01:07:46.065
That's right. Everybody,
let's welcome Wacky Wayne.

01:07:46.067 --> 01:07:47.466
Hi. Happy to be here.

01:07:47.468 --> 01:07:49.236
It's terrific to have you.

01:07:49.238 --> 01:07:50.770
Now, you're performing
this weekend.

01:07:50.772 --> 01:07:54.442
Is it just you or do you perform
in a group of your... kind?

01:07:55.810 --> 01:07:57.743
We have a...
There's a whole group of us.

01:07:57.745 --> 01:07:59.478
But I was the only one
who could make it here

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:02.348
'cause we all kinda hit it
pretty hard last night.

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:08.020
And now, I imagine that you
and the other clowns are close.

01:08:08.022 --> 01:08:10.022
You hang out outside of work?

01:08:10.024 --> 01:08:10.959
Yeah.

01:08:11.759 --> 01:08:14.294
So, if one of you were to get
a more lucrative clown job,

01:08:14.296 --> 01:08:15.995
you would talk it
amongst yourselves

01:08:15.997 --> 01:08:18.798
so it didn't become
some sort of weird,

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:20.167
toxic secret.

01:08:20.169 --> 01:08:23.636
Is there such thing
as a more lucrative clown job?

01:08:23.638 --> 01:08:25.072
Uh, you know,
you know what I love.

01:08:25.073 --> 01:08:27.107
Uh, when you guys throw pies
at each other's face.

01:08:27.109 --> 01:08:29.542
- I mean, that is hilarious.
- No, we... we don't do that.

01:08:29.545 --> 01:08:30.777
- You don't do that? Why not?
- No.

01:08:30.779 --> 01:08:33.179
- It's so messy.
- You know what's messy?

01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:34.513
Lies.

01:08:34.515 --> 01:08:37.483
Lies and deceit are two
of life's messiest things.

01:08:37.484 --> 01:08:38.783
They're not as messy as pies.

01:08:38.786 --> 01:08:40.386
- I gotta tell you.
- I would disagree.

01:08:40.388 --> 01:08:41.754
Wha... What are you doing?
Are you...

01:08:41.756 --> 01:08:44.557
I don't know.
You tell me, Mr. Channel 12.

01:08:44.559 --> 01:08:46.292
- Mr...
- I know everything.

01:08:46.295 --> 01:08:47.693
Uh, can we get back
to the clown?

01:08:47.694 --> 01:08:49.897
I'm talking to the clown.
You're the clown.

01:08:49.899 --> 01:08:51.464
You are the clown.

01:08:51.466 --> 01:08:53.600
This is the clown,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:08:53.602 --> 01:08:57.671
Oh, this is tough to watch.
Right, Felix?

01:08:58.538 --> 01:08:59.805
You're Felix, right?

01:08:59.807 --> 01:09:01.040
And you know what?
Not even a funny clown.

01:09:01.042 --> 01:09:02.942
- You are like...
- We are live right now.

01:09:02.944 --> 01:09:03.910
...a backstabbing clown.

01:09:03.912 --> 01:09:05.245
- All right, let's, uh...
- I'm the clown.

01:09:05.247 --> 01:09:06.479
I think what she means is...

01:09:06.481 --> 01:09:07.680
Too loose.

01:09:07.682 --> 01:09:09.082
I'm done taking to clowns.

01:09:09.084 --> 01:09:10.582
All right, well, let's get back
to the real clown.

01:09:10.585 --> 01:09:11.818
Uh, Wacky Wayne,
why don't you tell everybody

01:09:11.819 --> 01:09:13.319
where you're gonna be
this weekend.

01:09:13.322 --> 01:09:14.854
- One o'clock LA festival.
- Everybody, catch Wacky Wayne

01:09:14.857 --> 01:09:17.158
at the LA, uh, festival,
uh, 1 o'clock.

01:09:21.629 --> 01:09:22.862
- And we're out.
- Liz, Liz.

01:09:22.863 --> 01:09:24.863
Excuse me, can we talk, please?

01:09:24.866 --> 01:09:25.865
About what?

01:09:25.867 --> 01:09:27.633
About how you got
a huge new job?

01:09:27.635 --> 01:09:29.537
Or how you lied to me?

01:09:30.272 --> 01:09:31.636
I did not lie to you.

01:09:31.639 --> 01:09:33.738
You said you weren't
gonna be that guy.

01:09:33.741 --> 01:09:36.076
I should have told you,
and I'm sorry.

01:09:36.078 --> 01:09:37.112
You know what?

01:09:37.912 --> 01:09:40.883
What happened out there
was unprofessional.

01:09:41.984 --> 01:09:43.317
I'm sorry.

01:09:43.319 --> 01:09:44.919
But it's probably
a good thing.

01:09:45.787 --> 01:09:47.953
Because we really moved
into this too fast, and I was...

01:09:47.956 --> 01:09:49.657
- I was actually gonna ask you...
- Liz, Liz...

01:09:50.524 --> 01:09:52.428
if we could take
a step back.

01:09:54.562 --> 01:09:56.562
I wasn't gonna take
the Channel 12 job.

01:09:56.564 --> 01:09:59.268
I messed up, but I wasn't gonna
leave you, Liz.

01:10:00.269 --> 01:10:02.302
- Look...
- It's not like this was going anywhere.

01:10:02.304 --> 01:10:04.771
- We're just too different.
- We're not that different.

01:10:04.773 --> 01:10:07.007
I'm looking
for something honest

01:10:07.009 --> 01:10:08.808
and real and serious.

01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:12.180
And the longest relationship
you've had is with your dog.

01:10:16.484 --> 01:10:17.719
So, that's it?

01:10:18.454 --> 01:10:20.655
Y-you're... you're done?

01:10:21.890 --> 01:10:23.792
Yeah, I think that'd be
for the best.

01:10:24.625 --> 01:10:26.494
What about Sam and Brandy, huh?

01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:29.798
Sam's gonna be just fine.

01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:33.199
WACKY WAYNE
Oh, hey. There you guys are.

01:10:33.201 --> 01:10:35.101
Before I left, I just wanted...
That was just so much fun.

01:10:35.103 --> 01:10:37.237
It was a little strange,
but can I do a quick selfie?

01:10:37.239 --> 01:10:38.438
- Do you mind?
- Yeah, sure.

01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:39.772
Just 'cause you know...
For the guys.

01:10:39.774 --> 01:10:41.141
Aah!

01:10:42.610 --> 01:10:44.077
That was so great, I loved
the bit, "You're the clown!

01:10:44.079 --> 01:10:45.845
You're the clown!" You should
come out with us today.

01:10:45.847 --> 01:10:47.481

Charlie?

01:11:50.044 --> 01:11:52.046
Come on, Charlie,
don't die on me.

01:11:54.015 --> 01:11:55.648
You're gonna be okay,
all right.

01:11:55.650 --> 01:11:57.350
You're gonna be okay...

01:11:57.352 --> 01:11:58.686
I think.

01:12:10.898 --> 01:12:12.834
- How you doin'?
- Not good.

01:12:14.403 --> 01:12:15.770
Yeah, me either.

01:12:19.575 --> 01:12:20.806
Is he okay? Is he gonna make it?

01:12:20.808 --> 01:12:23.443
Charlie has toxicity poisoning.

01:12:23.445 --> 01:12:25.045
What's toxicity poisoning?

01:12:25.047 --> 01:12:27.481
Well, in layman's terms,
it means your dog is h...

01:12:27.483 --> 01:12:30.650
Hi, Ian.
What brings you in today?

01:12:30.652 --> 01:12:32.920
My tortoise ate my turtle.

01:12:33.754 --> 01:12:35.788
Okay, we'll circle
back to that.

01:12:35.790 --> 01:12:39.292
Uh, has Charlie come into
contact with any chocolate

01:12:39.294 --> 01:12:42.295
or medicinal substances?

01:12:42.297 --> 01:12:44.930
Like some kind
of, uh, brownie?

01:12:44.932 --> 01:12:48.902
A brownie? Sure.
Certain types of brownies?

01:12:48.904 --> 01:12:49.972
Stanley.

01:12:50.906 --> 01:12:53.940
My, uh, friend Stanley
who's in my band,

01:12:53.942 --> 01:12:55.941
he suffers from glaucoma.

01:12:55.943 --> 01:12:59.745
Yes. A glaucoma
patient's brownie.

01:12:59.747 --> 01:13:01.747
- That probably did it.
- Is he gonna die?

01:13:01.749 --> 01:13:03.949
Charlie's probably gonna be
okay, though.

01:13:03.951 --> 01:13:06.752
He just needs a lot of sleep
and IV fluids.

01:13:06.754 --> 01:13:08.157
And he needs to stay away
from Stanley.

01:13:09.591 --> 01:13:11.458
All right, come on, Ian.

01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:14.296
Let's go see if we can get your
turtle out of your tortoise.

01:13:16.765 --> 01:13:19.366
So that turtle-tortoise stuff
must really be

01:13:21.869 --> 01:13:23.903
What are you doing in there,
wise guy?

01:13:23.905 --> 01:13:25.438
Oh, I'm just helping myself

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:27.806
to some gourmet
delicious cold pizza,

01:13:27.808 --> 01:13:29.141

01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:40.322
Never noticed that
before Mabel.

01:13:41.223 --> 01:13:44.458
She filled the place
with her... presence.

01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:47.061
And her barking.

01:13:54.068 --> 01:13:55.102
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:13:55.870 --> 01:13:58.405
Getting all sentimental
over a dog.

01:13:58.407 --> 01:14:00.307
No. No, no,
I totally get it.

01:14:00.309 --> 01:14:02.377
She's part of your family.
It's totally fine, I...

01:14:03.111 --> 01:14:05.011
We're not gonna give up.
We'll find her.

01:14:05.013 --> 01:14:07.214
Yeah, okay, you gonna eat
that pizza or stare at it?

01:14:07.216 --> 01:14:09.217
We got work to do.
Let's get back.

01:14:24.499 --> 01:14:25.632
That's exactly

Oh, hey, you. All right.

Hello, sweetie pie.

01:15:41.076 --> 01:15:44.276
Okay, we found a dog wandering
in the street without a collar

01:15:44.278 --> 01:15:45.612
and we took her in.

01:15:45.614 --> 01:15:46.545

01:19:11.018 --> 01:19:14.254
But daddy does need
a cup of joe, so...

01:19:14.256 --> 01:19:15.922
Where is the bean water?

01:19:15.924 --> 01:19:17.390
- Right there.
- Okay.

01:19:17.392 --> 01:19:18.360
Yeah.

01:19:19.094 --> 01:19:21.293
- He seems nice.
- Yeah, so nice.

01:19:21.295 --> 01:19:24.530
This is good. Just keeping it
profesh. New co-host.

01:19:24.532 --> 01:19:27.266
- Yeah. You go, girl.
- Do people still say that?

01:19:27.268 --> 01:19:28.501
Oh, I do. Is that bad?

01:19:28.503 --> 01:19:30.837
- No, no. I-it works on you.
- Okay.

01:19:30.839 --> 01:19:34.607
Ah. Must be a downer,
but how sad about Jimmy, huh?

01:19:34.609 --> 01:19:37.010
- What about him?
- Oh.

01:19:37.012 --> 01:19:38.645
I heard he had
to put his dog down.

01:19:38.647 --> 01:19:41.080
- What? Brandy?
- Yeah.

01:19:41.082 --> 01:19:42.651
She had a stroke
or something.

01:19:43.417 --> 01:19:44.683
I-I'm sorry,
I thought you knew.

01:19:44.685 --> 01:19:46.654
I guess you guys aren't
on speaking terms.

01:19:47.989 --> 01:19:49.421
Gorgeous.

01:19:49.423 --> 01:19:51.156
Somebody give this coffee
a hard hat

01:19:51.158 --> 01:19:52.926
because it is workin'.

01:19:52.928 --> 01:19:54.159
Show time!

01:19:54.161 --> 01:19:56.563
We're live in five, four,

01:19:56.565 --> 01:19:58.196
three, two...

01:19:58.198 --> 01:20:00.769
I just can't believe she's gone.

01:20:01.803 --> 01:20:04.537
Brandy was Sam's best friend.

01:20:04.539 --> 01:20:06.439
She got him
out of his depression.

01:20:06.441 --> 01:20:09.109
She taught him
how to trust again.

01:20:10.045 --> 01:20:11.911
Sam is just...

01:20:11.913 --> 01:20:14.816
so, so sad.

01:20:21.756 --> 01:20:24.793
Are you sure that it's Sam
that's feeling this way?

01:20:26.328 --> 01:20:29.228
Yes. Why would you ask that?

01:20:29.230 --> 01:20:33.835
I noticed that you neglected
to bring Sam in today.

01:20:36.503 --> 01:20:37.336
Right.

01:20:37.338 --> 01:20:40.240
Ugh, I knew I forgot something.

01:20:41.042 --> 01:20:43.175
You did. Yeah, you did.

01:20:43.177 --> 01:20:44.446
You forgot Sam.

01:20:45.312 --> 01:20:47.349
Forgot to bring Sam in.

01:20:48.249 --> 01:20:49.651
I'm such a mess.

01:20:50.986 --> 01:20:53.288
That'll be $350.

01:20:55.024 --> 01:20:58.057
<i>It is shaping
up to be a beautiful August,</i>

01:20:58.059 --> 01:20:59.458
<i>back-to-school season.</i>

01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:02.294
Parents getting those kids
back on a routine,

01:21:02.296 --> 01:21:04.529
not just wilin' out at night

01:21:04.531 --> 01:21:07.600
and also a time for relief
for the weather.

01:21:07.602 --> 01:21:09.469
We're looking
at a nice cooldown

01:21:09.471 --> 01:21:11.037
and then, look out,
mid-week,

01:21:11.039 --> 01:21:14.273
we're looking
at huge thunderstorms.

01:21:14.275 --> 01:21:17.577
I'm just kidding. Had you
for a second though, right?

01:21:17.579 --> 01:21:19.046
Lot of people
don't know this about me,

01:21:19.048 --> 01:21:22.383
but I have
a great sense of humor.

01:21:30.224 --> 01:21:33.595
Mr. Charlie, yeah.
Time to wake up.

01:21:34.362 --> 01:21:35.995
This is no fun, is it?

01:21:35.997 --> 01:21:38.064
Getting woken up
by someone invading

01:21:38.066 --> 01:21:40.301
your personal space is no fun!

01:21:41.103 --> 01:21:42.270
Huh?

01:21:43.039 --> 01:21:44.037
Charlie?

01:21:45.073 --> 01:21:46.906
Hey! There he is!

01:21:46.908 --> 01:21:48.206
Let's go! Yeah! Here we go.

01:21:48.208 --> 01:21:49.778
Come on. I'll get you
a ginger shot.

01:21:50.779 --> 01:21:53.247
Don't rush it, pal.
The spot's gotta speak to you.

01:21:54.415 --> 01:21:56.516
Look at you, you're like
a kid in a candy store.

01:21:59.854 --> 01:22:01.523
I might go for a run.

01:22:03.458 --> 01:22:04.426
Maybe.

01:22:06.928 --> 01:22:11.196
Whoa. Who's this mature,
young man standing at my door?

01:22:11.198 --> 01:22:13.166
Oh, okay, yeah. Very funny.

01:22:13.168 --> 01:22:14.767
So what's the occasion?

01:22:14.769 --> 01:22:19.239
It's nothing. It's just this
dumb little piece of paper.

01:22:22.143 --> 01:22:23.910
I got an A.

01:22:23.912 --> 01:22:25.210
Come on. We're going out.

01:22:25.212 --> 01:22:27.947
Well, all right. Wise guy.

01:22:27.949 --> 01:22:29.751
Let me get my jacket.

01:22:31.885 --> 01:22:34.252
Hey! You look fantastic.

01:22:34.254 --> 01:22:37.222
Oh, thank you. I...
You don't look too bad yourself.

01:22:37.224 --> 01:22:39.158
What? This old thing?

01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:41.594
I actually just bought this.
Brand new. Gucci.

01:22:41.596 --> 01:22:43.361
- Full price, not cheap.
- Oh.

01:22:45.133 --> 01:22:46.966
There you go.

01:22:46.968 --> 01:22:48.534
What's this? A corsage?

01:22:48.536 --> 01:22:50.069
No, no, no,
those are for your high heels

01:22:50.071 --> 01:22:51.606
so they don't mess up
my carpet.

01:22:52.707 --> 01:22:53.906
Oh, uh...

01:22:53.908 --> 01:22:55.309
Of course.

01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:01.914
Wow! That's really loud!

01:23:01.916 --> 01:23:04.251
Yeah, I like to hear it
with my whole body.

01:23:05.153 --> 01:23:06.420

Oh. Hey. Giant balloon dogs.

01:23:33.982 --> 01:23:36.115
- You know it.
- Come on. How about a photo?

01:23:36.117 --> 01:23:37.786
Yeah, I'd love to. Uh...

01:23:38.987 --> 01:23:42.321
Oh, you just... mean a photo

01:23:42.323 --> 01:23:43.822

01:23:46.693 --> 01:23:48.493
Oh, wait, no.
Actually, my nose looks weird.

01:23:48.495 --> 01:23:49.661
Let's do another one.

01:23:49.663 --> 01:23:51.030
I feel like
I should go check in.

01:23:51.032 --> 01:23:52.497
Okay, great. And if you could
go up a little bit

01:23:52.499 --> 01:23:53.532
and I'll stay down.

01:23:53.534 --> 01:23:55.469

- Okay, great.

01:23:57.272 --> 01:23:58.604

01:24:00.441 --> 01:24:01.841

- Okay.

01:24:01.843 --> 01:24:03.042

How about a post?

01:24:03.044 --> 01:24:04.078
Oh. Yeah.

01:24:15.322 --> 01:24:18.323
Hashtag Dr. Mike. Nice job.

01:24:18.325 --> 01:24:20.159
- Thank you.
- Oh, let's go shake some hands.

01:24:20.161 --> 01:24:21.661
Kiss some puppies.

01:24:21.663 --> 01:24:22.562
Okay.

01:24:22.564 --> 01:24:24.065
She cleans up nice.

01:24:24.799 --> 01:24:26.532
Don't get me wrong.
You do, too.

01:24:26.534 --> 01:24:29.101

Okay, I'm not gonna lie.

01:24:39.446 --> 01:24:42.315
I, uh, I had an ulterior motive
to bring you out here.

01:24:42.317 --> 01:24:44.349
Ulterior. Good word.

01:24:44.351 --> 01:24:46.485
See any that you like?

01:24:46.487 --> 01:24:48.590
Well, I like 'em all.
They're all cute.

01:24:49.490 --> 01:24:50.792
Let me rephrase that.

01:24:51.626 --> 01:24:53.761
Do you see any
that you want to adopt?

01:24:55.362 --> 01:24:56.862
I know you still miss Mabel.

01:24:56.864 --> 01:25:00.034
But maybe it's time
for you to move on.

01:25:02.170 --> 01:25:03.370
You know, Tyler,

01:25:04.438 --> 01:25:06.506
I never wanted to adopt Mabel.

01:25:07.407 --> 01:25:08.506
Really?

01:25:08.508 --> 01:25:10.676
I always thought
dogs were a hassle.

01:25:10.678 --> 01:25:12.580
More trouble
than they were worth.

01:25:14.249 --> 01:25:17.685
But my wife, Addie, she pestered
me about it till I gave in.

01:25:18.620 --> 01:25:21.087
We must've looked at a 100 dogs

01:25:21.089 --> 01:25:22.656
before she chose Mabel.

01:25:23.423 --> 01:25:26.658
"This one," she said,
"This is our dog."

01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:28.395
She was right.

01:25:29.697 --> 01:25:32.000
Mabel made our lives
just a little sweeter.

01:25:34.569 --> 01:25:36.170
So when I lost my wife...

01:25:37.373 --> 01:25:40.506
it felt like it was my job
to take care of Mabel.

01:25:40.508 --> 01:25:43.144
Make sure she was as spoiled
as Addie wanted her to be.

01:25:45.213 --> 01:25:47.846
As much as I miss Mabel,
the hardest part about all this

01:25:47.848 --> 01:25:50.717
is feeling like
I let my wife down.

01:25:51.853 --> 01:25:53.888
Walter, I think
Addie will understand.

01:25:54.689 --> 01:25:56.421
I think she would want you
to be happy again.

01:25:56.423 --> 01:26:00.092
Oh, I know.
And I am happy, I mean...

01:26:00.094 --> 01:26:02.897
At least I'm getting there,
thanks to you.

01:26:03.898 --> 01:26:04.864
To me?

01:26:04.866 --> 01:26:06.801
Well, you got me
out of the house.

01:26:07.534 --> 01:26:08.833
I'm wearing this damn suit,

01:26:08.835 --> 01:26:11.072
I feel like I'm a part
of the world again, so...

01:26:12.506 --> 01:26:14.042
thank you, pizza boy.

01:26:14.842 --> 01:26:17.912
Thank you, y-your friendship
means a lot to me.

01:26:20.648 --> 01:26:22.548
- You're not gonna like this.
- What?

01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:24.283
- You're gonna hate me for this.
- Oh, no. Oh, no.

01:26:24.285 --> 01:26:27.653
- Come on. Comin' in.
- Oh, oh, oh, okay.

01:26:27.655 --> 01:26:30.089
I forgive you.

01:26:30.091 --> 01:26:33.225
- Just don't make it a habit.
- All right. All right.

01:26:33.227 --> 01:26:34.828
This one's pretty cute, huh?

01:26:35.829 --> 01:26:38.264
This one looks like
a little pain in the ass.

01:26:40.734 --> 01:26:43.970
So, um, and when
he touched the shoe...

01:26:43.972 --> 01:26:46.872
and this is a button and
this one is white and then...

01:26:46.874 --> 01:26:50.109
Hey! What are you guys doing?

01:26:50.111 --> 01:26:51.777
We're reading a book.

01:26:51.779 --> 01:26:54.647
You are? But why
are you dressed like fairies?

01:26:54.649 --> 01:26:59.018
Not fairies.
As fairy dinosaur princess.

01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:00.921
Oh.

01:27:02.056 --> 01:27:05.024
Amelia, I have some news
I have to tell you,

01:27:05.026 --> 01:27:06.693
and it's kind of sad.

01:27:08.696 --> 01:27:09.998
Okay, here it goes.

01:27:10.732 --> 01:27:14.300
Um, you have been doing
such a great job

01:27:14.302 --> 01:27:16.037
taking care of Mr. Snuggles.

01:27:17.005 --> 01:27:18.504
Thank you.

01:27:18.506 --> 01:27:20.741
And I know she loves
playing with you.

01:27:21.476 --> 01:27:23.541
Uh, it's just...

01:27:23.543 --> 01:27:26.178
we found out that Mr. Snuggles

01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:28.116
has an owner named Walter.

01:27:29.450 --> 01:27:31.717
- Walter?
- Yeah.

01:27:31.719 --> 01:27:34.687
And Walter lost Mr. Snuggles

01:27:34.689 --> 01:27:36.991
and he misses her very much.

01:27:38.026 --> 01:27:40.995
So as much as we'd like
to keep Mr. Snuggles,

01:27:41.796 --> 01:27:43.964
I'm afraid she's gonna
have to go back home.

01:27:48.302 --> 01:27:50.036
Oh.

01:27:50.038 --> 01:27:51.904
Yeah. I know.

01:27:51.906 --> 01:27:54.273
I know, sweetie.
It's so sad.

01:27:54.275 --> 01:27:56.077
And happy too.

01:27:58.946 --> 01:28:00.079
How?

01:28:00.081 --> 01:28:02.817
Mr. Snuggles gets
to go back home.

01:28:07.522 --> 01:28:09.788
Yeah. Yes, she does.

01:28:09.790 --> 01:28:11.892
And Walter will be happy too.

01:28:14.594 --> 01:28:17.597
Walter will be very happy.

01:28:18.499 --> 01:28:20.299
And I'm sure
he's gonna wanna thank you

01:28:20.301 --> 01:28:21.669
for taking care of her.

01:28:22.537 --> 01:28:25.173
Does it mean
we have to say goodbye now?

01:28:26.808 --> 01:28:29.476
No. No, we don't have
to say goodbye now.

01:28:29.478 --> 01:28:30.544
We can do that tomorrow.

01:28:30.546 --> 01:28:32.712
- Yay!
- Mm-hmm.

01:28:34.014 --> 01:28:36.082
I understand
why some people choose

01:28:36.084 --> 01:28:37.749
not to adopt.

01:28:37.751 --> 01:28:39.351
Life is hard enough as it is.

01:28:39.353 --> 01:28:41.022
Why-why make it any harder?

01:28:44.525 --> 01:28:45.860
So why are we here?

01:28:46.828 --> 01:28:48.863
Why are we doing this?

01:28:53.368 --> 01:28:54.336
It's for them.

01:28:55.436 --> 01:28:58.504
You know, uh, for a lot of dogs
that come to New Tricks stores,

01:28:58.506 --> 01:29:00.672
life has been really hard.

01:29:00.674 --> 01:29:02.909
For some of them,
it's been downright cruel.

01:29:04.178 --> 01:29:06.778
And yet, they find a way

01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:10.718
to open their hearts to us

01:29:11.452 --> 01:29:13.853
to love and to be loved,

01:29:13.855 --> 01:29:15.988
and I-I find that beautiful.

01:29:15.990 --> 01:29:18.092
And so, I'm asking you today

01:29:19.025 --> 01:29:21.895
to find a way for you
to open up your heart.

01:29:23.697 --> 01:29:26.664
Or your checkbook,
whichever one opens first

01:29:26.666 --> 01:29:28.300
and let's find a new home
for New Tricks.

01:29:28.302 --> 01:29:30.970
That would be amazing.
Any contribution will help.

01:29:30.972 --> 01:29:34.173
Thank you so much. Um, oh,
and-and I just want to give

01:29:34.175 --> 01:29:38.846
a quick shout-out to our
incredible party planner.

01:29:39.581 --> 01:29:41.180
Tara, thank you so much.

01:29:41.182 --> 01:29:43.482
Thank you for making
New Tricks your purpose.

01:29:43.484 --> 01:29:47.186
All right, go drink, be merry,
Frunk will be back soon.

01:29:47.188 --> 01:29:49.190
- Whoo!
- Have fun.

01:29:50.491 --> 01:29:54.095
And adopt a dog. You wanna do
that one as well. Okay.

01:33:09.657 --> 01:33:11.158
She was wonderful.

01:33:14.595 --> 01:33:16.228
Yes, she was.

01:33:16.230 --> 01:33:17.164
Thank you.

01:33:18.998 --> 01:33:20.733

What is it?

01:33:21.935 --> 01:33:23.236
Uh, it's just a gift.

01:33:23.970 --> 01:33:25.206
It's just, um...

01:33:26.106 --> 01:33:27.939

01:34:12.085 --> 01:34:14.820
You know, just being
a part of this,

01:34:14.822 --> 01:34:18.724
it has given me
so much, I ju...

01:34:21.762 --> 01:34:22.963
Hey.

01:34:26.333 --> 01:34:27.501
This is all you.

01:34:30.437 --> 01:34:32.704
You know, if someone would just
give this sweet girl a home,

01:34:32.706 --> 01:34:34.138
my life would be complete.

01:34:34.140 --> 01:34:37.676
Well, um, someone actually
adopted her this evening.

01:34:37.678 --> 01:34:39.280
No way. Who?

01:34:41.816 --> 01:34:43.317
I did. This guy.

01:34:44.718 --> 01:34:47.555
You know, sometimes people don't
realize how amazing a dog is.

01:34:48.622 --> 01:34:50.422
But, um...

01:34:50.424 --> 01:34:52.692
I know how special she is,
and I-I realized

01:34:52.694 --> 01:34:54.494
I didn't want to let her go.

01:35:10.912 --> 01:35:12.213
What are you doing?

01:35:13.614 --> 01:35:16.350
Well, I just realized
I didn't want to let you go.

01:35:18.752 --> 01:35:22.119
And listen, I'm-I'm not saying
that we need to jump back

01:35:22.121 --> 01:35:24.325
into a relationship, but...

01:35:25.926 --> 01:35:28.894
I care about you.
And so does Sam.

01:35:28.896 --> 01:35:31.196
And we would both
really love it

01:35:31.198 --> 01:35:32.764
if we could spend...

01:35:32.766 --> 01:35:34.168
God, I wanna kiss you
right now...

01:35:36.370 --> 01:35:38.972

whole rule about on camera PDA.

01:38:22.636 --> 01:38:24.070
We found her.

01:38:24.072 --> 01:38:26.039
Oh, I hear you.

01:38:29.077 --> 01:38:30.641
Hey, hey.

01:38:30.643 --> 01:38:31.542
Hey!

01:38:31.544 --> 01:38:32.811
Oh, my God,
you look amazing.

01:38:32.813 --> 01:38:36.148
Oh... Thanks, we're doing
so much better.

01:38:36.150 --> 01:38:38.450
- Hi, Charlie bear!
- What happened?

01:38:39.787 --> 01:38:41.019
Carol happened.

01:38:41.021 --> 01:38:42.454
Greg had to go back to work,

01:38:42.456 --> 01:38:44.389
so his mom flew in to help us.

01:38:44.391 --> 01:38:46.858
And she does everything
so much better than us.

01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:49.795
You know, I got four hours
of sleep last night.

01:38:49.797 --> 01:38:51.229
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

01:38:51.231 --> 01:38:53.066
No, that's really good.

01:38:53.068 --> 01:38:54.833
I'm really proud of you.

01:38:54.835 --> 01:38:57.135
You're a single mom,
and you're doing it.

01:38:57.137 --> 01:38:58.772
Well, I have Greg.

01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:01.139
You're a single mom.

01:39:02.609 --> 01:39:03.575
Watch this.

01:39:03.577 --> 01:39:05.944
- Frunk.
- Oh, God.

01:39:05.946 --> 01:39:07.881
Uh... Frunk.

01:39:09.283 --> 01:39:11.084
Great. I'm gonna have
to say "Frunk"

01:39:11.086 --> 01:39:12.517
any time I want him
to do anything?

01:39:12.519 --> 01:39:14.586
You see,
Frunk can mean anything.

01:39:14.588 --> 01:39:17.689
Well, I hope he wasn't
too much of a burden to you.

01:39:17.691 --> 01:39:18.724
Oh, no, he was.

01:39:18.726 --> 01:39:20.624
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, it's good.

01:39:20.626 --> 01:39:23.695
I feel like I spend so much
of my time burdening you.

01:39:23.697 --> 01:39:24.763
No.

01:39:24.765 --> 01:39:27.165
I mean, you really, really
take care of me.

01:39:27.167 --> 01:39:31.169
You lend me money, you give me
a place to stay when I need it,

01:39:31.171 --> 01:39:32.604
you pay the insurance
of my van.

01:39:32.606 --> 01:39:33.741
Wait, I do?

01:39:34.908 --> 01:39:35.876
No.

01:39:37.112 --> 01:39:38.679
Can we visit her?

01:39:40.048 --> 01:39:41.916
I don't know,
but we can certainly ask.

01:39:43.316 --> 01:39:45.284
I'm sad, Mommy.

01:39:48.555 --> 01:39:50.055
Oh.

01:39:50.057 --> 01:39:52.124
I'm sad, too.

01:39:52.126 --> 01:39:53.259
But you know what?

01:39:53.994 --> 01:39:56.762
We are still a family.
Okay.

01:39:56.764 --> 01:39:59.600
And families help each other
through sad times.

01:40:01.769 --> 01:40:02.770
Do you want a hug?

01:40:03.938 --> 01:40:04.873
Yeah?

01:40:06.006 --> 01:40:07.306
Oh.

01:40:09.442 --> 01:40:11.576
- Mr. Chapman.
- Walter. Hey. Hello.

01:40:11.578 --> 01:40:12.844
- All right.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

01:40:12.846 --> 01:40:14.212
- I've heard such great things.
- Pleasure.

01:40:14.214 --> 01:40:15.547
Likewise.

01:40:15.549 --> 01:40:17.415
Uh, Tyler is a good kid.

01:40:17.417 --> 01:40:19.151
- He is a great kid. Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:40:19.153 --> 01:40:22.221
Oh, uh, this stuff
is for you here. Um...

01:40:22.223 --> 01:40:24.523
We, uh, we just picked up
a couple of things

01:40:24.525 --> 01:40:26.125
- so the dog will be more comfortable.
- Okay.

01:40:26.127 --> 01:40:27.461
All right.

01:40:32.099 --> 01:40:33.432
You're a good dog.

01:40:34.802 --> 01:40:35.736
Okay.

01:40:37.137 --> 01:40:38.071
I gotta go.

01:40:39.173 --> 01:40:40.841
Try not to miss me too bad.

01:40:41.975 --> 01:40:43.710
I won't miss you at all.

01:40:52.653 --> 01:40:55.386
- All right, I'll see you soon.
- Aw.

01:40:59.193 --> 01:41:00.892
Dax, are you crying?

01:41:00.894 --> 01:41:02.060
Yeah.

01:41:02.062 --> 01:41:03.597
This is what happens.

01:41:05.065 --> 01:41:07.098
Plus, I was maced, like...

01:41:07.100 --> 01:41:09.268
- pretty recently.
- Okay. Okay.

01:41:09.270 --> 01:41:11.903
So I can't control
when I'm tearin' up.

01:41:11.905 --> 01:41:12.973
Oh!

01:41:13.707 --> 01:41:16.077
He likes it when you put
these on his food.

01:41:17.278 --> 01:41:19.945
- What is that...
- You remember when you said that I saved you?

01:41:19.947 --> 01:41:21.947
I said no human food!

01:41:21.949 --> 01:41:23.215
Okay, bye.

01:41:23.217 --> 01:41:24.785
Love you. Bye, burden.

01:41:26.787 --> 01:41:27.821
Del Taco?

01:41:40.868 --> 01:41:41.802
Mabel.

01:41:45.005 --> 01:41:46.437
Good girl.

01:41:49.910 --> 01:41:50.878
Honey.

01:42:07.027 --> 01:42:08.728
Hey!

01:42:09.997 --> 01:42:11.597
Hey!

01:42:13.432 --> 01:42:15.602
Well, don't you look
slim and trim.

01:42:19.072 --> 01:42:21.172
- Well, hello!
- Hi.

01:42:21.174 --> 01:42:23.942
- What's your name?
- Amelia Chapman.

01:42:23.944 --> 01:42:26.044
Have you been taking care
of this dog, Amelia?

01:42:26.046 --> 01:42:29.282
- Feeding her and walking her?
- Why, yes, I have.

01:42:29.284 --> 01:42:30.781
Well, she looks so happy.

01:42:30.783 --> 01:42:32.752
You must be doing
a great job.

01:42:40.627 --> 01:42:42.894
Uh, well, sweetie,
I think it's probably time

01:42:42.896 --> 01:42:44.696
we should say goodbye
to the doggie

01:42:44.698 --> 01:42:46.600
so she can go back home.

01:42:48.068 --> 01:42:49.534
Oh, um, we were wondering

01:42:49.536 --> 01:42:51.370
if we could visit your dog

01:42:51.372 --> 01:42:53.007
every once in a while.

01:43:02.616 --> 01:43:03.951
I don't think so.

01:43:05.052 --> 01:43:06.584
Oh. Okay.

01:43:06.586 --> 01:43:08.354
We just thought we'd ask.

01:43:08.356 --> 01:43:09.854
No, um, you misunderstood.

01:43:09.856 --> 01:43:13.225
I mean... I don't think
you'll be able to visit

01:43:13.227 --> 01:43:14.861
because there's been
a mistake.

01:43:16.897 --> 01:43:18.464
This isn't my dog.

01:43:20.466 --> 01:43:21.969
I'm sorry, what?

01:43:23.536 --> 01:43:25.739
I'd say this is your dog.

01:43:28.642 --> 01:43:30.041
Walter, you don't have
to do that.

01:43:30.043 --> 01:43:34.114
What a lucky dog
to have such a sweet family.

01:43:36.917 --> 01:43:39.517
- I don't know what to say here.
- No, nothing to say.

01:43:39.519 --> 01:43:42.222
Just... misunderstanding,
that's all.

01:43:43.589 --> 01:43:46.858
Well, the dog seems to like you
a lot, so, uh...

01:43:46.860 --> 01:43:48.860
...if you'd like, you know,

01:43:48.862 --> 01:43:50.328
we could meet up
in the park sometime.

01:43:50.330 --> 01:43:51.999
Yes. Yes.

01:43:53.567 --> 01:43:55.569
You know,
I'd like that very much.

01:43:57.472 --> 01:43:58.970
Is that okay with you?

01:43:58.972 --> 01:44:00.071
Of course.

01:44:00.073 --> 01:44:02.408
Of course.

01:44:02.410 --> 01:44:03.910
All right. Well...

01:44:04.811 --> 01:44:07.511
I-I know you don't
know me, but...

01:44:07.513 --> 01:44:08.645
- Aw.
- Thank you, thank you,

01:44:08.647 --> 01:44:10.649
thank you, thank you,
thank you!

01:44:12.551 --> 01:44:13.754
You're welcome.

01:44:17.557 --> 01:44:19.024
- Enjoy.
- Yeah.

01:44:19.026 --> 01:44:20.925
- Thank you, sir.
- See you soon, huh?

01:44:20.927 --> 01:44:21.860
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:44:21.862 --> 01:44:22.796
All right.

01:44:24.499 --> 01:44:27.932
Mommy, why are you crying?
Are you sad?

01:44:27.934 --> 01:44:29.701
No.

01:44:29.703 --> 01:44:31.204
No, I'm not sad, I'm happy!

01:44:31.938 --> 01:44:34.307
Sometimes, people cry
when they're happy.

01:44:46.586 --> 01:44:48.521
Well, good morning,
or should I say

01:44:48.523 --> 01:44:50.289
wake up, LA.

01:44:50.291 --> 01:44:53.392
We're here at the beach today
with my dog Sam.

01:44:53.394 --> 01:44:56.227
<i>All dogs love
the beach, so come on down.</i>

01:44:56.229 --> 01:44:57.996
ELIZABETH
<i>We do love the beach...</i>

01:44:57.998 --> 01:45:00.631
Oh, hey, you!

01:45:00.633 --> 01:45:04.202
Oh, I know your spot.
Right there. Yeah.

01:45:04.204 --> 01:45:06.073
That's what you came for, huh?

01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:09.207
Oh, well, now look at you.

01:45:09.209 --> 01:45:11.142
Where'd you come from?

01:45:11.144 --> 01:45:14.413
Oh, hello, beautiful!

01:45:14.415 --> 01:45:16.748
Oh, look. Yeah, okay...

01:45:16.750 --> 01:45:19.716
Sorry, Walter, one of the dogs
knows how to open up doors.

01:45:19.718 --> 01:45:22.187
Ah, it's All right.
<i>Mi casa su casa.</i>

01:45:22.189 --> 01:45:23.154
Ah...

01:45:26.827 --> 01:45:30.428
- What?
- I took Spanish in high school.

01:45:30.430 --> 01:45:32.797
Anyway, um... Look.

01:45:32.799 --> 01:45:35.900
Walter, uh,
I know we kid, or I kid

01:45:35.902 --> 01:45:38.537
and you stare blankly
at me, but, um,

01:45:38.539 --> 01:45:40.473
I just wanna say
thank you so much

01:45:40.475 --> 01:45:41.941
for opening up your home.

01:45:42.775 --> 01:45:45.343
And I hope my thanking you
hasn't been annoying.

01:45:45.345 --> 01:45:47.278
It is annoying. Please, stop.

01:45:48.614 --> 01:45:50.582
Message received.

01:45:50.584 --> 01:45:52.517
- Uh... thank you.
- Okay.

01:45:52.519 --> 01:45:54.187
Who wants to go outside?

01:46:05.399 --> 01:46:06.732
Aww.

01:46:11.404 --> 01:46:12.738
Hey, baby.

01:46:13.940 --> 01:46:15.773
- That's my girlfriend.
- Mm-hmm.

01:46:15.775 --> 01:46:17.711
Oh, don't feed Darla.
Her tummy's upset.

01:46:18.478 --> 01:46:20.280
- Hey, old man.
- Wise guy.

01:46:23.016 --> 01:46:24.849
I hope it's not weird
we're dating.

01:46:24.851 --> 01:46:27.255
No. No, I'm just happy
you're happy.

01:46:28.489 --> 01:46:29.720
And to be honest,

01:46:29.722 --> 01:46:32.025
I think you two are perfect
for each other.

01:46:33.593 --> 01:46:34.793
Oh.

01:46:35.661 --> 01:46:37.130
Mm, sweet.

01:46:38.965 --> 01:46:40.100
Thank you.

01:46:44.738 --> 01:46:46.171
Have you seen Gertrude?

01:46:46.173 --> 01:46:48.206
<i>Who is this little guy?</i>

01:46:48.208 --> 01:46:49.841
<i>Oh, my God. I didn't
know my friend Scotch was coming</i>

01:46:49.843 --> 01:46:51.644
<i>to visit me today.</i>

01:46:51.646 --> 01:46:53.245
<i>Is she yours?</i>

01:46:53.247 --> 01:46:54.811
<i>Nope, she's ours.</i>

01:46:54.813 --> 01:46:56.780
- <i>Wanna hold her?
- Yes, I wanna hold her.</i>

01:46:57.918 --> 01:46:59.617
Hey, what is this?
What is this?

01:47:00.887 --> 01:47:02.387
No.

01:47:02.389 --> 01:47:03.855

Looks like you're
in deep Shih Tzu.

01:48:10.123 --> 01:48:12.457
You know, I'm actually surprised
you knew these were Shih Tzus.

01:48:12.459 --> 01:48:13.625
I know my dogs.

01:48:13.627 --> 01:48:15.760
You know your Shih Tzu
about Shih Tzus.

01:48:17.163 --> 01:48:19.530
- Dude, your dog is fat.
- Excuse me?

01:48:19.532 --> 01:48:21.399
Oh, I'm sorry,
what I meant to say is

01:48:21.401 --> 01:48:22.767
your dog is super fat.

01:48:22.769 --> 01:48:23.801
Excuse me?

01:48:23.803 --> 01:48:24.769
What I meant to say is

01:48:24.771 --> 01:48:26.372
if your dog gets any bigger,

01:48:26.374 --> 01:48:28.307
its feet won't be able
to touch the ground.

01:48:28.309 --> 01:48:29.375
Excuse me?

01:48:29.377 --> 01:48:30.974
I feel like if I hit
your dog hard enough,

01:48:30.976 --> 01:48:32.112
candy will fly out.

01:48:32.911 --> 01:48:35.148

Ew. He's talking

01:48:40.987 --> 01:48:43.790

Foghat is just

"Whoa, some of your hair's dark

And I was like, "Thank you."

01:49:41.081 --> 01:49:43.581
He got me this jacket

I can.

01:50:05.572 --> 01:50:06.903

01:50:10.008 --> 01:50:11.942
How many instruments
did you learn to play

01:50:11.944 --> 01:50:13.513
before you learned
to play the drums?

01:50:14.647 --> 01:50:16.881
- Just drums.
- Just... God! Jes...

01:50:16.883 --> 01:50:18.950
All right. You know what?

01:50:23.289 --> 01:50:24.790
What kind of car you drive?

01:50:24.792 --> 01:50:25.923
I drive a Fiat.

of those cars?

01:50:28.696 --> 01:50:30.428
You can fit one passenger
and then two in the back.

01:50:30.430 --> 01:50:31.763

It's not like...

- Oh, man.

01:50:36.669 --> 01:50:38.002
No, it's not safe.

01:50:38.004 --> 01:50:39.337
Did you always know
you wanted to be a clown?

01:50:39.339 --> 01:50:42.875
No, I got into
it in my late 30s.

01:50:42.877 --> 01:50:44.041
Which is not usual.

01:50:44.043 --> 01:50:45.109

01:50:45.111 --> 01:50:46.177
Why do you do this every time?

01:50:46.179 --> 01:50:48.045
Give me them kisses.
Oh, yes.

01:50:48.047 --> 01:50:49.981

like, scratching his way
out of my face.

01:51:07.835 --> 01:51:09.233
It's like in my molars.

01:51:09.235 --> 01:51:12.071
