01:45.298 --> 01:46.799
Hello!

01:46.800 --> 01:48.034
Hi, can you help me please?

01:48.035 --> 01:49.367
I need some help
with my car, please.

01:49.368 --> 01:50.669
I'm sorry, we're closed.

01:50.670 --> 01:51.670
I can't.

01:52.672 --> 01:54.805
Look baby, baby look at me.

01:54.806 --> 01:55.673
Look at me.

01:55.674 --> 01:56.640
Alright, look at me.

01:56.641 --> 01:57.608
We can get through this okay.

01:57.609 --> 01:58.575
We can get through this.

01:58.576 --> 01:59.643
I'm just gonna sort the car out

01:59.644 --> 02:01.310
and then we're gonna go alright.

02:01.311 --> 02:04.180
We're gonna go and we're
not gonna look back.

02:04.181 --> 02:05.748
Yeah?

02:05.749 --> 02:07.215
We're not gonna look back
because we can beat this.

02:07.216 --> 02:08.717
Alright, we can
beat this I promise.

02:08.717 --> 02:09.851
We're gonna be fine.

02:09.852 --> 02:11.086
Yeah, I'm bleeding.

02:11.087 --> 02:12.587
I know, I know.
I'm bleeding.

02:12.588 --> 02:14.889
I know.

02:14.890 --> 02:17.825
But I'm gonna get us
help, I promise you.

02:17.826 --> 02:19.458
Alright, I'm gonna get us help.

02:21.062 --> 02:23.763
Please, just look
at me, look at me.

02:23.764 --> 02:25.297
Just stay awake alright, please.

02:25.298 --> 02:26.298
Just stay awake.

02:27.901 --> 02:28.901
Please.

02:29.736 --> 02:30.836
Hello!

02:30.837 --> 02:32.603
Is he alright?

02:32.604 --> 02:34.272
Look, can you just have
a look at my car please?

02:34.273 --> 02:35.406
I don't know what's
wrong with it.

02:35.407 --> 02:36.841
It just keeps stalling.

02:36.842 --> 02:38.075
I don't know what's going on

02:38.076 --> 02:39.376
and I really need to
get going, please.

02:39.377 --> 02:40.977
But is he okay?

02:40.978 --> 02:43.345
Can you please
just look at my bloody car!

02:43.346 --> 02:45.081
Just have a look at my car!

02:45.082 --> 02:45.915
Is he okay?

02:45.916 --> 02:47.283
Is he okay?

02:47.284 --> 02:48.718
Please, just tell
what's wrong with it.

02:48.719 --> 02:49.851
It won't work!

02:49.852 --> 02:51.119
I'm in a real hurry.

02:51.120 --> 02:53.354
I've got to go, I
can't hang about.

02:53.355 --> 02:54.622
Please.

02:54.623 --> 02:56.390
Alright, I'll see what I can do.

02:56.391 --> 02:57.624
Please.

03:07.867 --> 03:08.867
Julie.

03:09.969 --> 03:11.035
Is Max safe?

03:12.038 --> 03:13.070
Is he okay?

03:14.740 --> 03:15.740
Oh my God.

03:18.110 --> 03:19.043
What?

03:19.044 --> 03:20.109
What the skull?

03:21.846 --> 03:23.846
Well he went under
again for the skull?

03:24.915 --> 03:26.614
But that's what has
to be destroyed.

03:29.252 --> 03:30.886
Well yeah, he wouldn't
be able to brink again,

03:30.887 --> 03:32.153
you can only do it once.

03:32.154 --> 03:33.887
Those are the rules.

03:35.791 --> 03:36.791
Oh my God.

03:40.995 --> 03:42.795
Well if Max is gone
that means we're next.

03:59.677 --> 04:00.511
Look, can you please hurry up,

04:00.512 --> 04:01.711
I really need to go.

04:07.417 --> 04:09.985
I think you've got problem
with your spark plugs

04:09.986 --> 04:12.119
and it seems to be misfiring.

04:13.222 --> 04:16.456
What kind of stuff
are you mixed up in?

04:20.861 --> 04:22.728
It's nothing anyone can do now.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.065
No one can help us.

04:37.042 --> 04:38.142
No.

04:38.143 --> 04:39.810
No, no, no, no!

04:39.811 --> 04:40.811
Nikki.

04:41.712 --> 04:42.913
Nikki!

04:42.914 --> 04:44.747
Nikki get me out!

04:44.748 --> 04:46.281
Get me out Nikki!

04:47.417 --> 04:50.352
Okay, I just need
to go in the office

04:50.353 --> 04:53.354
and check what parts
and bits I've got.

04:53.355 --> 04:54.823
Nikki, wake me up!

04:54.824 --> 04:55.990
Okay?

04:55.991 --> 04:57.430
Be back, and it
might take some time.

05:03.831 --> 05:04.831
You're back.

05:06.200 --> 05:08.667
Oh it's so lovely to see
you again sweetheart.

05:09.802 --> 05:10.868
I need to wake up.

05:12.405 --> 05:16.140
I can't, I can't stay here.

05:16.141 --> 05:18.608
Your soul belongs
to him now son.

05:19.845 --> 05:21.977
You gave it to him
when you passed over.

05:23.347 --> 05:24.347
It's his now.

05:25.816 --> 05:27.049
Surrender to him.

05:27.884 --> 05:29.184
Mom, no.

05:29.185 --> 05:31.219
No, I wanted to see you.

05:32.288 --> 05:34.021
I'm not ready, I'm
not ready to die yet.

05:34.022 --> 05:35.856
That's not your
decision anymore.

05:38.961 --> 05:41.427
We all have to
surrender at some point.

05:42.964 --> 05:43.964
Now is

05:45.866 --> 05:46.866
your time.

05:59.844 --> 06:01.611
Welcome to the dark side.

06:32.438 --> 06:33.438
No.

06:39.611 --> 06:40.610
No.

06:43.781 --> 06:46.382
No, no, no, no, no, no.

06:46.383 --> 06:47.383
No, no, no!

06:48.818 --> 06:49.818
No!

06:50.854 --> 06:51.854
No please!

06:52.621 --> 06:53.621
Please!

06:55.224 --> 06:56.857
Ambulance please.

06:57.960 --> 07:01.094
Baby, baby, baby,
please wake up!

07:01.095 --> 07:02.428
Please wake up!

07:04.065 --> 07:05.964
Please don't leave me!

07:12.138 --> 07:15.340
I can see he's bleeding.

07:19.978 --> 07:21.311
Please don't.

07:23.013 --> 07:24.013
I need you.

07:31.254 --> 07:32.254
My God.

07:34.190 --> 07:35.189
No.

07:37.592 --> 07:38.592
Oh my God.

07:41.395 --> 07:43.729
You have to help me please!

07:46.600 --> 07:47.433
Help!

07:47.434 --> 07:49.001
Please!

07:49.002 --> 07:50.269
Please!

08:13.489 --> 08:14.422
I don't know what they're on

08:14.423 --> 08:16.924
but you need to get down here.

08:25.566 --> 08:26.733
She's stabbed herself!

08:26.734 --> 08:29.234
You better get down here now!

08:45.282 --> 08:47.250
I don't wanna go
to the other side.

08:55.891 --> 08:56.891
No.

09:52.238 --> 09:56.107
I just think that maybe
if your grades can't improve

09:56.108 --> 09:57.608
and you can't find
a way of juggling

09:57.609 --> 10:01.111
your home life and
your university life,

10:01.112 --> 10:05.182
then just maybe it would
be worth taking a gap year.

10:05.183 --> 10:06.849
Like your brother.

10:06.850 --> 10:09.384
Nursing isn't something
you can just fly by.

10:11.054 --> 10:13.254
You're gonna need
to get decent grades

10:13.255 --> 10:16.190
in order to work in
a decent hospital.

10:17.359 --> 10:19.258
You shouldn't see
it as a negative.

10:21.062 --> 10:24.598
Some people just need
to recharge and refocus.

10:24.599 --> 10:27.333
Honestly, I don't think
a year out would help me.

10:27.334 --> 10:30.236
Your brother, I spoke
to him a little while back

10:30.237 --> 10:32.704
and he seems to
think it's done him

10:32.705 --> 10:35.073
the world of good
since your mother...

10:35.074 --> 10:38.775
Professor, my brother's
not coming back.

10:39.878 --> 10:41.778
What do you mean
he's not coming back?

10:43.647 --> 10:46.148
My brother, since
my moms passing he's,

10:47.118 --> 10:49.118
he's not been himself.

10:49.119 --> 10:51.053
He's not the same anymore.

10:51.054 --> 10:52.488
Well he's quite the dare devil

10:52.489 --> 10:54.556
from what I've seen online.

10:54.557 --> 10:56.791
That's not the worst part.

10:56.792 --> 10:58.793
What you saw online,
those stints,

10:58.794 --> 11:01.828
to become famous or
whatever he's doing it for,

11:01.829 --> 11:04.497
it's a reaction
to the situation.

11:06.267 --> 11:09.801
Since moms passing, he's
kind of lost control.

11:12.038 --> 11:14.472
Look, listen to me okay.

11:14.473 --> 11:16.541
You're not alone on this.

11:16.542 --> 11:18.642
No one is ever alone really.

11:19.577 --> 11:21.210
Unless they make themselves.

11:23.081 --> 11:26.649
You can be helped if you
want people to help you.

11:26.650 --> 11:27.883
You and your brother.

11:29.186 --> 11:30.486
I know, I get it.

11:30.487 --> 11:32.253
I screwed up my
grades this year.

11:33.589 --> 11:36.191
I'm not taking a gap year.

11:36.192 --> 11:38.392
This is the only thing
that's keeping me sane.

11:38.393 --> 11:40.694
It's the only thing
giving me structure.

11:40.695 --> 11:42.929
I've got to continue the year

11:43.764 --> 11:46.698
and just sort my life out.

11:47.868 --> 11:49.235
Well if it ever gets
too hard, then just...

11:49.236 --> 11:50.068
It won't.

11:50.069 --> 11:51.102
It won't get too hard.

12:35.274 --> 12:36.473
Anything important?

12:38.843 --> 12:40.176
Just something for mom.

12:42.214 --> 12:43.214
It's trash.

12:44.082 --> 12:45.547
How was college?

12:48.385 --> 12:49.385
It was fine.

12:49.386 --> 12:51.086
How was your day?

12:51.087 --> 12:52.955
Yeah, great actually.

12:52.956 --> 12:56.791
Went over the 50K mark with
my viewers on a new post.

12:56.792 --> 12:57.792
Wanna see?

12:59.061 --> 13:00.528
Sure.

13:00.529 --> 13:01.529
Drink?

13:02.331 --> 13:03.330
At four p.m.

13:04.098 --> 13:05.098
No then?

13:06.033 --> 13:08.201
Suit yourself.

13:08.202 --> 13:09.201
I'm good thanks.

13:10.503 --> 13:12.036
Hey watch this.

13:17.643 --> 13:18.643
Where is this?

13:18.644 --> 13:19.644
Alright, look.

13:29.253 --> 13:30.519
Why you always got to
shun my parade huh?

13:30.520 --> 13:32.922
What are you actually doing?

13:32.923 --> 13:36.191
Making something of
myself Lil, that's what.

13:36.192 --> 13:38.126
By climbing to the top of
some insanely tall building

13:38.127 --> 13:40.628
with no protection,
drinking at four p.m.

13:40.629 --> 13:42.062
and flunking college?

13:42.063 --> 13:44.164
Yeah, making
something of yourself.

13:44.165 --> 13:45.365
Sure, great.

13:45.366 --> 13:46.933
Why are you so
quick to judge huh?

13:46.934 --> 13:48.768
I'm trying alright.

13:48.769 --> 13:50.770
Well try a little harder.

13:50.771 --> 13:52.337
You know, it'd be
nice to receive just

13:52.338 --> 13:54.940
an ounce of support sometime.

13:54.941 --> 13:56.608
Alright great, just
walk away then, great.

13:56.609 --> 13:58.276
I'll see you at
breakfast then Lil.

13:58.277 --> 14:00.944
Or even the same time,
same place tomorrow yeah?

15:39.228 --> 15:40.728
I read up about it.

15:40.729 --> 15:42.496
Everything's gonna be okay.

15:42.497 --> 15:44.698
We got each others
backs alright.

15:44.699 --> 15:47.933
We do this and if
it works, it works.

15:49.269 --> 15:52.904
If it doesn't then, worse
case we get woken up.

15:52.905 --> 15:55.039
You think this girl
would do it for us?

15:56.376 --> 15:58.943
You think she'll be there
if anything go wrong?

15:58.944 --> 16:00.878
Where is she?

16:00.879 --> 16:02.245
Thing is, she,

16:04.316 --> 16:05.881
one of us might have to do it.

16:07.184 --> 16:08.551
Do what?

16:08.552 --> 16:11.253
Oh, you're awake.

16:11.254 --> 16:13.455
I thought you'd be
asleep or something.

16:13.456 --> 16:14.523
Who are these people?

16:14.524 --> 16:16.258
Go to your room.

16:16.259 --> 16:17.324
That's it, come on.

16:23.098 --> 16:24.564
Explain, now.

16:24.565 --> 16:26.133
I tried to before.

16:26.134 --> 16:28.301
I was going to before,
but you just stormed off

16:28.302 --> 16:31.036
over the sight of me
climbing a god damn building!

16:31.037 --> 16:33.139
Answer me, who are those people?

16:33.140 --> 16:34.507
Look.

16:34.508 --> 16:36.707
I met them online okay.

16:38.644 --> 16:42.278
They saw my videos and
said they had this idea.

16:43.348 --> 16:46.383
Crazy idea but a cool idea.

16:46.384 --> 16:48.117
What kind of idea?

16:48.118 --> 16:49.451
You're gonna freak out.

16:50.354 --> 16:51.354
Just tell me.

16:55.458 --> 16:59.561
Francis lost his girlfriend
in a terrible car crash.

16:59.562 --> 17:00.627
He was the driver.

17:02.431 --> 17:03.931
It was a total accident.

17:03.932 --> 17:06.633
But he prays every day that
he could say sorry to her.

17:06.634 --> 17:08.101
And Francis is?

17:08.102 --> 17:09.367
He's the guy in there.

17:10.171 --> 17:11.805
What's that got to do with you?

17:11.806 --> 17:13.438
He wants to see her again.

17:14.441 --> 17:16.339
As does Zara, the girl in there.

17:17.544 --> 17:18.910
She wants to be reconnected
with her brother

17:18.911 --> 17:20.877
who she lost when
they were little.

17:21.680 --> 17:23.146
Where are you going with this?

17:23.147 --> 17:24.647
What?

17:24.648 --> 17:25.882
You wanna play with some
Ouija board or something?

17:25.883 --> 17:27.384
Jeff you've lost me.

17:27.385 --> 17:29.252
Francis found this thing online.

17:29.253 --> 17:32.354
This ritual that means
you can cross over

17:32.355 --> 17:34.323
into the afterlife.

17:34.324 --> 17:36.357
And if you completely
let yourself cross over

17:36.358 --> 17:39.861
then you can potentially speak
to those who've passed on.

17:39.862 --> 17:42.362
Jeff, you've completely lost me.

17:42.363 --> 17:43.330
Letting yourself cross over,

17:43.331 --> 17:45.165
what are you talking about?

17:45.166 --> 17:47.534
It's called Brinking.

17:47.535 --> 17:50.135
People have done it before
and they say it works.

17:51.705 --> 17:52.771
You wanna see mom?

17:58.377 --> 18:00.177
I wanna do it for my channel.

18:04.149 --> 18:06.549
I wanna film the whole
thing and then post it.

18:06.550 --> 18:07.584
Sorry.

18:07.585 --> 18:08.651
Have you taken something?

18:08.652 --> 18:09.586
What is it?

18:09.587 --> 18:10.787
What are you taking?

18:10.788 --> 18:12.121
Because only a
drugged up lunatic

18:12.122 --> 18:13.322
would say something like this.

18:13.323 --> 18:14.823
Jesus Jeff!

18:14.824 --> 18:16.658
Listen alright, I thought
it would be a cool experiment.

18:16.659 --> 18:18.725
Something that might
get a lot of views.

18:19.628 --> 18:20.628
I wanted to ask you.

18:20.629 --> 18:22.263
Ask you if you'd be there

18:22.264 --> 18:25.832
because you do
nursing and stuff.

18:25.833 --> 18:27.533
Just in case
anything goes wrong.

18:28.870 --> 18:30.903
If something does go wrong,
you'd be the best person

18:30.904 --> 18:33.639
to have around because
of your experience.

18:33.640 --> 18:34.640
Goes wrong how?

18:38.844 --> 18:41.179
It's the way you actually do it.

18:41.180 --> 18:43.113
You got to let
yourself bring death.

18:43.114 --> 18:44.815
We figured a way of doing it.

18:44.816 --> 18:46.183
If you suffocate yourself,

18:46.184 --> 18:48.585
let your body go and
lose consciousness,

18:48.586 --> 18:51.152
then you can actually
brink onto the other side.

18:53.390 --> 18:55.490
So you guys actually
want to kill yourselves

18:55.491 --> 18:56.557
for this experiment?

18:57.827 --> 19:01.161
Jeff, I'm not a doctor,
I'm a training nurse.

19:02.564 --> 19:04.231
Well technically we're not
actually killing ourselves.

19:04.232 --> 19:07.001
Because if we come
back, we brink death.

19:07.002 --> 19:08.535
But technically you are.

19:08.536 --> 19:10.003
You are actually
killing yourselves

19:10.004 --> 19:10.937
and reviving your bodies.

19:10.938 --> 19:12.372
That's not why we're doing it.

19:12.373 --> 19:14.306
We're not getting into
this full steam ahead

19:14.307 --> 19:15.706
without no research.

19:16.743 --> 19:18.242
Jeff, this is crazy.

19:19.379 --> 19:21.779
And you're considering
actually filming them.

19:21.780 --> 19:23.014
You'll go to jail.

19:23.015 --> 19:24.814
I'm not considering
filming them.

19:27.852 --> 19:29.285
I'll be doing it with them.

19:31.821 --> 19:33.389
You're kidding me.

19:33.390 --> 19:34.622
Then do it for me.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.891
Do it for me, do it for us.

19:39.328 --> 19:41.962
'Cause if you don't, we're
just gonna do it anyway.

19:43.332 --> 19:44.397
With or without you.

19:54.274 --> 19:55.540
We leave in the morning.

20:21.063 --> 20:22.530
Doing the coffee?

20:22.531 --> 20:24.799
I thought you threw the
towel in with that stuff eh?

20:24.800 --> 20:25.800
Make me one.

20:26.601 --> 20:28.602
Yeah I'm gonna need it today.

20:28.603 --> 20:30.403
Camera, check.

20:30.404 --> 20:32.470
Sound equipment, check.

20:33.506 --> 20:35.440
Diva light, check.

20:36.876 --> 20:38.042
What's a diva light?

20:39.144 --> 20:41.212
I saw some trashy
girls online using it.

20:41.213 --> 20:42.647
They said it was the
most complimentary

20:42.648 --> 20:43.648
type of lighting.

20:44.716 --> 20:46.917
You wanna look
sexy when you die?

20:46.918 --> 20:47.918
Why the hell not?

20:56.193 --> 20:59.660
Look, I'm not just doing
this for my channel alright.

21:00.796 --> 21:02.596
There is a chance
I could see mom.

21:03.898 --> 21:04.898
Say goodbye.

21:06.468 --> 21:08.101
Properly goodbye her.

21:09.069 --> 21:10.369
It's a risk worth taking.

21:14.308 --> 21:16.173
Alright, thank you
for being there.

21:18.411 --> 21:21.311
You supporting me means a lot.

21:26.985 --> 21:27.917
Alright.

21:27.918 --> 21:30.420
Come on, let's get going.

21:30.421 --> 21:32.588
We've only got the
church for a few hours.

21:42.131 --> 21:43.731
We got until noon
to get up out of here.

21:43.732 --> 21:46.033
You think I wanna
risk getting caught?

21:46.034 --> 21:48.035
Stuff already in the back room?

21:48.036 --> 21:49.970
I got it all set up bro.

21:49.971 --> 21:51.837
I got a key to lock it up.

21:51.838 --> 21:53.272
We can fix it later on.

21:53.273 --> 21:54.406
What stuff?

21:55.542 --> 21:58.475
We got to make a
show of it ain't we?

22:52.656 --> 22:54.823
It's so pretty in here.

22:57.594 --> 22:58.893
You'll soon get bored.

22:58.894 --> 23:00.060
You see it every day.

23:01.597 --> 23:02.597
Come on this way.

23:14.942 --> 23:18.510
Hey guys, Jeff here,
daredevil genius.

23:18.511 --> 23:20.678
We have a wild one.

23:21.814 --> 23:23.748
Something that I've
never done before.

23:23.749 --> 23:26.884
Well, especially not
as dangerous before.

23:26.885 --> 23:29.319
It is close to the wire guys.

23:29.320 --> 23:31.187
And everything you're
about to see today

23:31.188 --> 23:34.022
is completely and utterly real.

23:34.891 --> 23:36.692
Now we all take responsibility

23:36.693 --> 23:38.393
and full consent for
what we're about to do

23:38.394 --> 23:40.727
because it is pretty fucked up.

23:41.630 --> 23:43.765
So we all take responsibility.

23:43.766 --> 23:45.533
Am I right?

23:45.534 --> 23:47.000
Yeah.

23:47.001 --> 23:50.370
I take full responsibility
for my actions today.

23:50.371 --> 23:51.438
That's right.

23:51.439 --> 23:53.305
I'm here because I wanna be.

23:53.306 --> 23:55.140
Ain't nobody forcing
me to be here.

23:56.042 --> 23:58.743
In today's video, we will be

24:00.446 --> 24:01.446
Brinking.

24:02.681 --> 24:05.482
A legend that goes, and
if you say this ritual

24:05.483 --> 24:07.251
and focus on your loved one,

24:07.252 --> 24:09.986
completely focus your
mind on that loved one,

24:11.121 --> 24:14.456
then it is said that it
will bring them forward.

24:15.559 --> 24:17.858
And then if you let
your body pass on,

24:18.995 --> 24:20.928
then you will be able
to connect with them.

24:23.099 --> 24:24.465
But fear not,

24:24.466 --> 24:27.034
we do not intend
on staying dead.

24:27.035 --> 24:29.269
An unknown helper
will resuscitate us

24:29.270 --> 24:31.571
after three minutes.

24:31.572 --> 24:34.339
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

24:35.542 --> 24:37.475
we do not advise
trying this at home.

24:47.152 --> 24:48.151
We ready?

24:51.455 --> 24:52.455
You ready?

24:53.590 --> 24:54.856
What have I got to do?

24:56.159 --> 24:57.159
It's simple.

24:57.928 --> 24:59.961
You watch the timer.

24:59.962 --> 25:01.595
And after three minutes,

25:02.932 --> 25:03.932
wake us up.

25:09.904 --> 25:10.904
Okay.

25:16.443 --> 25:17.576
Let's make history.

25:32.289 --> 25:34.490
For the powers that see,

25:34.491 --> 25:36.925
for the powers that be,

25:36.926 --> 25:38.860
let them be present,

25:40.663 --> 25:42.797
and let us cross over in peace,

25:42.798 --> 25:44.164
and return in the life.

25:45.767 --> 25:48.002
For the powers that see,

25:48.003 --> 25:49.735
for the powers that be,

25:50.705 --> 25:52.539
let them be present,

25:52.540 --> 25:55.307
and let us cross over in peace,

25:55.308 --> 25:57.041
and return in light.

25:59.613 --> 26:00.612
Okay.

26:02.147 --> 26:04.415
Now think of your little brother

26:04.416 --> 26:06.749
and speak the last
memory you have of him.

26:08.519 --> 26:11.153
And when you're
ready, we'll begin.

26:27.369 --> 26:29.002
My little brother Issac.

26:34.141 --> 26:36.541
He was 10-years-old
when he left this world.

26:40.813 --> 26:42.480
We snuck out of the house.

26:44.449 --> 26:45.548
Dad had no idea.

26:49.186 --> 26:51.587
We went to a nearby
construction site.

26:55.959 --> 26:57.059
We were running around

26:57.060 --> 27:00.996
and we heard a police car.

27:00.997 --> 27:02.397
We thought we'd get caught.

27:02.398 --> 27:04.731
Both of us running
as fast as we could.

27:11.239 --> 27:13.338
That was the last
time I saw him.

27:19.946 --> 27:21.845
I had no idea what happened.

27:24.050 --> 27:26.215
That he'd hit his head
on the scaffolding.

27:29.487 --> 27:30.487
I left him.

27:34.291 --> 27:37.059
Maybe if I'd stayed he'd
still be with us today.

27:39.128 --> 27:40.528
But I didn't notice.

27:43.399 --> 27:44.398
I just ran.

27:50.104 --> 27:51.104
Isaac.

27:52.707 --> 27:54.006
I'm coming for you now.

27:56.743 --> 27:58.242
You're not alone.

28:55.926 --> 28:56.759
Grab her arms.
What are you doing!

28:56.760 --> 28:58.360
Grab her arms.

28:58.361 --> 28:59.361
When she stops moving
What are you doing!

28:59.362 --> 29:00.628
Start the timer.

30:59.395 --> 31:01.130
Start the timer.

31:01.131 --> 31:01.964
Is she dead?

31:01.965 --> 31:03.098
Start the timer.

31:03.099 --> 31:03.932
Do it now Lily!

31:03.933 --> 31:04.999
Come on.

31:05.000 --> 31:09.970
Come on, we got to get moving.

31:15.309 --> 31:16.742
Man.

31:16.743 --> 31:17.743
Man I'm sure.

31:20.347 --> 31:22.514
You don't have to do this.

31:22.515 --> 31:24.115
No.

31:24.116 --> 31:25.617
I wanna do it.

31:25.618 --> 31:26.851
I wanna.

31:26.852 --> 31:28.619
Say your memory.

31:28.620 --> 31:30.753
Let's get this over with.

31:33.424 --> 31:37.492
My girl Amy, I remember the
way she smelled that night.

31:39.763 --> 31:41.228
It was our anniversary.

31:45.001 --> 31:46.066
A drunk man,

31:47.769 --> 31:49.636
just came out of nowhere.

31:52.340 --> 31:53.805
I never reacted in time.

31:58.012 --> 31:59.343
I'm ready Jeff.

32:00.280 --> 32:01.680
Let's do this.

32:01.681 --> 32:02.713
Let's do it.

33:16.043 --> 33:17.043
Amy.

33:21.514 --> 33:22.514
Amy

33:27.319 --> 33:28.319
Amy.

33:34.092 --> 33:35.092
Amy.

33:40.797 --> 33:41.631
We got to get going.

33:41.632 --> 33:42.831
It's my turn.

33:42.832 --> 33:44.633
I'm gonna need your help.

33:44.634 --> 33:45.500
What?

33:45.501 --> 33:46.701
What do you mean?

33:46.702 --> 33:47.982
I need you to hold me down.

33:49.004 --> 33:50.404
What?

33:50.405 --> 33:51.672
It'll be my natural
instinct to try to break free.

33:51.673 --> 33:53.741
I need you to hold me down.

33:53.742 --> 33:54.806
I won't do that.

33:56.043 --> 33:57.109
Don't let me down.

34:05.351 --> 34:06.351
Jeff.

34:09.855 --> 34:11.321
The last time I saw you mom,

34:15.092 --> 34:16.958
is when you left
the house that day.

34:20.897 --> 34:23.864
If I'd of known anything
would have happened to you,

34:27.202 --> 34:29.603
I would of never let you go.

34:33.940 --> 34:35.775
I wish I could say
goodbye to you.

34:39.413 --> 34:41.146
Tell you how much
you mean to me.

34:46.018 --> 34:47.985
I'm sorry I'm such a fuck up.

34:52.056 --> 34:53.589
I wanna make things right.

34:54.726 --> 34:57.092
I wanna make this all right.

35:02.865 --> 35:03.865
I miss you mom.

35:08.970 --> 35:14.039
Lily, do it.

35:15.810 --> 35:16.810
Do it Lily!

35:18.145 --> 35:19.145
Lily do it.

35:22.215 --> 35:23.215
Do it!

35:56.844 --> 35:58.243
Jeff, Jeff no!

36:03.983 --> 36:04.816
No!

36:04.817 --> 36:05.817
No Jeff!

36:09.354 --> 36:10.420
No, no Jeff!

36:19.330 --> 36:20.729
No!

36:20.730 --> 36:21.730
No Jeff!

36:23.099 --> 36:24.099
No!

36:25.668 --> 36:26.868
No!

36:26.869 --> 36:27.869
No!

36:31.974 --> 36:32.973
No!

36:55.393 --> 36:56.393
Oh God.

37:53.942 --> 37:54.942
Isaac?

37:57.278 --> 37:58.944
Isaac are you here?

38:00.814 --> 38:01.947
Are you here?

38:03.583 --> 38:04.583
Boo!

38:07.053 --> 38:08.053
Did I scare you?

38:13.825 --> 38:14.825
Amy?

38:17.094 --> 38:18.094
Amy.

38:34.475 --> 38:35.675
You're here.

38:35.676 --> 38:36.676
Amy.

38:38.579 --> 38:39.579
Is that you?

38:40.347 --> 38:41.880
It's me Francis.

38:46.051 --> 38:47.117
I can't...

38:51.357 --> 38:54.257
I can't believe
it's actually you.

38:55.860 --> 38:57.060
I can't believe.

38:57.061 --> 38:59.862
I can't believe
you're standing here

38:59.863 --> 39:01.663
right in front of me.

39:02.833 --> 39:04.498
I can't believe it.

39:20.281 --> 39:21.281
Mom?

39:30.622 --> 39:31.622
Oh God.

39:34.259 --> 39:36.026
Who are you?

39:36.027 --> 39:37.426
Isaac it's me.

39:38.329 --> 39:39.329
Zara.

39:41.398 --> 39:42.231
No.

39:42.232 --> 39:43.232
Zara's my sister.

39:44.367 --> 39:46.568
A little girl, like me.

39:47.503 --> 39:48.902
She grew up Isaac.

39:49.872 --> 39:51.505
Whilst you were gone I grew up.

39:52.341 --> 39:53.973
I'm your sister Zara.

39:56.144 --> 39:57.144
You're Zara.

39:58.046 --> 39:59.045
Yes.

39:59.746 --> 40:00.979
You're really pretty.

40:02.716 --> 40:05.082
Oh Issac, I've
missed you so much.

40:19.296 --> 40:20.296
Mom?

40:26.169 --> 40:27.169
Jeff.

40:29.805 --> 40:30.805
Mom?

40:33.442 --> 40:36.008
Mom I'm so sorry I never
go to say goodbye to you.

40:38.846 --> 40:41.213
That I never to say how
truly amazing you are.

40:45.685 --> 40:46.951
I miss you mom.

40:49.588 --> 40:50.588
We both do.

40:52.725 --> 40:53.756
Me and Lily.

40:55.727 --> 40:56.859
I miss you both too.

41:00.097 --> 41:01.463
I love you Jeff.

41:06.335 --> 41:08.168
I love you too mom.

41:12.841 --> 41:14.140
You missed my birthday.

41:16.344 --> 41:17.577
I've been alone here.

41:19.213 --> 41:21.380
Alone on my birthday
for a while now.

41:23.117 --> 41:24.116
I'm here.

41:25.485 --> 41:27.185
I'm here with you now mom.

41:27.186 --> 41:28.186
For good?

41:30.288 --> 41:32.122
I can stay a while.

41:33.458 --> 41:35.291
Then I have to leave.

41:36.527 --> 41:37.527
Leave?

41:38.496 --> 41:39.496
No.

41:40.464 --> 41:41.730
You're here now.

41:43.500 --> 41:44.500
So you stay.

41:47.037 --> 41:48.536
The reason I'm here is

41:48.537 --> 41:51.004
because I have to let you go.

41:52.775 --> 41:56.976
I have to say goodbye properly.

42:00.714 --> 42:02.013
I'm not going anywhere.

42:05.886 --> 42:07.451
You can't leave me again.

42:08.621 --> 42:10.321
Not now.

42:16.628 --> 42:18.295
It's always dark here.

42:18.296 --> 42:20.028
You haven't seen grandpa?

42:21.665 --> 42:22.831
I'm always alone.

42:24.168 --> 42:25.167
The darkness.

42:26.002 --> 42:27.401
Are you staying with me?

42:29.505 --> 42:31.806
Oh Isaac I wish I was.

42:31.807 --> 42:32.807
One day I will.

42:33.575 --> 42:35.076
One day I'll be here with you

42:35.077 --> 42:36.509
and I won't go anywhere.

42:37.311 --> 42:38.878
One day?

42:38.879 --> 42:40.914
Yes, one day.

42:40.915 --> 42:43.514
But until that one
day, I'll be alone.

42:44.951 --> 42:45.951
You're never alone.

42:46.619 --> 42:47.619
Ow!

42:49.555 --> 42:51.923
My head hurts.

42:51.924 --> 42:53.357
What do you mean?

42:53.358 --> 42:55.325
You left me.

42:55.326 --> 42:57.160
You left me while my head hurt.

42:57.161 --> 42:59.663
It's not like that.

42:59.664 --> 43:01.696
It hurts all the time.

43:11.407 --> 43:12.407
Zara.

43:13.575 --> 43:15.074
Okay, okay, okay.

43:17.979 --> 43:19.978
Two, three, four, five.

43:21.448 --> 43:23.049
Where does it hurt?

43:23.050 --> 43:24.050
Here.

43:33.291 --> 43:34.291
One, two,

43:35.327 --> 43:38.895
three, four, five,
six, seven, eight,

43:38.896 --> 43:39.896
nine, 10.

43:41.332 --> 43:43.866
You're not going
anywhere sister.

43:43.867 --> 43:46.534
He has your soul just
like he has mine.

43:55.410 --> 43:57.344
Zara, Zara, can you hear me?

43:57.345 --> 43:58.378
It's Lily!

43:58.379 --> 43:59.379
Zara!

44:02.015 --> 44:04.917
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

44:09.789 --> 44:10.789
Seven, eight,

44:11.757 --> 44:12.757
nine, 10.

44:14.392 --> 44:15.225
Zara!

44:15.226 --> 44:16.059
Zara!

44:16.060 --> 44:17.060
Zara.

44:17.929 --> 44:22.998
Zara.

44:23.534 --> 44:24.534
Are you okay?

44:25.335 --> 44:27.269
I've missed you.

44:27.270 --> 44:29.503
I've missed you so much.

44:44.818 --> 44:48.053
I'm so sorry for
what happened to you.

44:48.054 --> 44:49.487
I'm sorry that day.

44:51.056 --> 44:52.489
I regret all of it.
Shh.

44:54.092 --> 44:56.159
You're here now.

45:01.365 --> 45:02.731
Are you okay?

45:02.732 --> 45:04.133
Are you okay?

45:04.134 --> 45:05.234
Yeah?

45:05.235 --> 45:06.734
Francis, Francis!

45:35.627 --> 45:38.529
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven,

45:38.530 --> 45:39.562
eight, nine.

45:39.563 --> 45:41.431
One, two, three, four, five,

45:41.432 --> 45:43.498
six, seven, eight, nine.

45:58.512 --> 46:00.013
Nine, 10.

46:00.014 --> 46:01.748
Francis, can you hear me?

46:01.749 --> 46:02.749
It's Lily.

46:04.284 --> 46:05.284
Francis!

46:10.956 --> 46:12.924
One, two, three, four, five,

46:12.925 --> 46:16.293
six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

46:19.464 --> 46:20.564
Francis!

46:20.565 --> 46:25.367
Francis!

46:27.137 --> 46:28.136
Jeff!

46:30.606 --> 46:31.439
Jeff.

46:31.440 --> 46:32.573
Oh God, okay.

46:33.775 --> 46:35.409
Jeff, okay.

46:35.410 --> 46:36.576
One, two, three.

46:54.559 --> 46:56.861
Five, six, seven,
eight, nine, 10.

46:56.862 --> 46:57.862
Jeff, Jeff!

46:59.463 --> 47:00.997
Jeff, can you hear me?

47:00.998 --> 47:02.464
Jeff, it's Lily.

47:04.467 --> 47:05.834
Okay, try again.

47:05.835 --> 47:06.769
Can you hold it tight.

47:06.770 --> 47:07.569
Hold it tight, hold it tight.

47:07.570 --> 47:10.039
Four, five, six, seven.

47:10.040 --> 47:13.241
Three, four, five, six, seven.

47:42.866 --> 47:44.000
Eight, nine, 10.

47:44.001 --> 47:45.668
Come on, wake him up.
Jeff!

47:45.669 --> 47:46.502
Help, help!

47:46.503 --> 47:47.502
Jeff, can you hear me?

47:47.503 --> 47:48.503
It's Lily.

47:48.504 --> 47:49.338
Hello?

47:49.339 --> 47:50.471
Hello, can you hear me?

47:52.141 --> 47:53.407
Four, five, six, Wake up man!

47:53.408 --> 47:54.475
Seven, eight, Jeff!

47:54.476 --> 47:56.811
Jeff! Five, six, seven... Jeff!

47:56.812 --> 47:57.745
Five, six, seven.

47:57.746 --> 47:59.846
Yo dude, wake up!

47:59.847 --> 48:00.913
Mom, are you okay?

48:03.384 --> 48:04.384
Mom?

48:05.251 --> 48:06.517
Welcome home.

48:07.620 --> 48:08.687
Wake up man!

48:08.688 --> 48:09.621
Eight, nine, 10.

48:09.622 --> 48:10.356
You got to wake up!

48:10.357 --> 48:11.189
Jeff!

48:11.190 --> 48:12.023
Come on!

48:12.024 --> 48:12.857
Jeff!

48:12.858 --> 48:13.925
Wake up man!

48:13.926 --> 48:14.959
Jeff!
One, two, three,

48:14.960 --> 48:16.194
Get up!
Four, five, six, seven

48:16.195 --> 48:17.361
Eight, nine, 10.
Come on Jeff!

48:17.362 --> 48:18.328
Six, seven, eight, nine.

48:18.329 --> 48:19.529
Bro, wake up!

48:27.304 --> 48:28.137
Jeff!

48:28.138 --> 48:29.138
Jeff!

48:29.139 --> 48:30.405
Come on man, breathe!

48:30.406 --> 48:33.040
That's right, that's right man.

48:35.177 --> 48:36.676
Breathe, breathe.

48:37.612 --> 48:38.579
Breathe.

48:38.580 --> 48:40.247
That's right man, breathe.

48:40.248 --> 48:41.313
Breathe man.

48:44.685 --> 48:46.184
Oh Jeff.

48:49.722 --> 48:50.856
Breathe.

48:50.857 --> 48:51.923
Breathe.

48:51.924 --> 48:52.924
Breathe.

48:56.161 --> 48:57.227
It worked!

48:58.030 --> 48:59.363
That's right man.

48:59.364 --> 49:01.031
It worked.

49:01.032 --> 49:04.199
It worked man, it worked.

49:07.303 --> 49:08.870
Are you sure it was mom?

49:09.806 --> 49:11.339
She was different like,

49:12.474 --> 49:14.508
there was something
different about her.

49:16.111 --> 49:17.311
It was mom.

49:17.312 --> 49:19.413
I'm sure as hell it was mom.

49:19.414 --> 49:20.781
She was in this space.

49:20.782 --> 49:22.549
A dark space right?

49:22.550 --> 49:24.483
Abyss of nothing.

49:24.484 --> 49:25.985
Just a dark dimension.

49:25.986 --> 49:27.620
Other worldly like.

49:27.621 --> 49:29.655
We all went to
the same place then.

49:29.656 --> 49:31.723
We must have, just
different areas.

49:31.724 --> 49:32.724
Areas

49:33.592 --> 49:36.360
or maybe time doesn't exist.

49:36.361 --> 49:38.494
I have no idea
what that place was.

49:39.831 --> 49:42.465
The ritual, the words we said.

49:42.466 --> 49:43.733
I think that
brought them forward

49:43.734 --> 49:45.101
and we brought
them in the middle.

49:45.102 --> 49:47.469
You mean like some
kind of mid-dimension?

49:48.838 --> 49:51.106
Some kind of place between
the living and the dead.

49:51.107 --> 49:52.474
I mean I guess so.

49:52.475 --> 49:55.341
Before I left the world,
before I left Amy,

49:56.812 --> 49:57.877
it was like,

49:59.314 --> 50:00.313
it wasn't her.

50:01.749 --> 50:04.250
Something happened
in that dimension.

50:04.251 --> 50:05.118
What do you mean?

50:05.119 --> 50:06.119
What happened?

50:07.287 --> 50:08.419
Before I woke up,

50:10.557 --> 50:11.789
she just snapped.

50:13.325 --> 50:14.792
She started to bite me.

50:14.793 --> 50:16.660
Everything about that felt real.

50:17.729 --> 50:20.063
She started to
bite into my neck.

50:20.064 --> 50:21.798
And now I got a mark.

50:21.799 --> 50:23.467
Look.

50:23.468 --> 50:24.800
What the hell is that?

50:24.801 --> 50:26.469
Look, you probably
caught yourself

50:26.470 --> 50:29.004
waking up or something, come on.

50:29.005 --> 50:31.172
I had something similar too.

50:31.173 --> 50:32.674
Go on.

50:32.675 --> 50:34.755
Why do you got to support
the negatives all the time?

50:36.212 --> 50:37.478
Zara, what did you see?

50:37.479 --> 50:40.848
This thing appeared
before I left the world.

50:40.849 --> 50:41.682
A thing?

50:41.683 --> 50:44.150
Isaac, he vanished

50:44.151 --> 50:46.419
and this thing stood before me.

50:46.420 --> 50:49.020
Not wanting me to
leave that dimension.

50:49.021 --> 50:51.356
Wanting to keep me dead.

50:51.357 --> 50:53.492
And what'd it look like?

50:53.493 --> 50:54.592
It wasn't human.

50:55.427 --> 50:57.094
Whatever it was it wasn't human.

50:57.095 --> 50:59.697
It was this thing, this monster!

50:59.698 --> 51:02.098
It had the face of a monster...
Stop.

51:02.099 --> 51:03.298
Honestly, stop.

51:04.802 --> 51:06.201
You saw it too didn't you?

51:09.038 --> 51:10.772
Answer me!

51:10.773 --> 51:12.574
You saw it too right?

51:12.575 --> 51:14.007
I'm not going crazy am I?

51:15.344 --> 51:17.345
Whatever happens on
the way out of that place

51:17.346 --> 51:20.547
was probably our brains
getting mixed up in the moment.

51:20.548 --> 51:22.048
We were dead.

51:22.049 --> 51:25.118
We physically died in
that moment in time.

51:25.119 --> 51:28.087
Sure as hell our brains are
gonna play tricks on us.

51:28.088 --> 51:30.055
You think your girlfriend
took a bite out of your neck?

51:30.056 --> 51:31.890
It was probably the
girls being rough handed

51:31.891 --> 51:32.824
with you when they woke you up.

51:32.825 --> 51:33.858
And you think you saw a monster?

51:33.859 --> 51:35.260
I mean come on!

51:35.261 --> 51:38.328
Stop over-analyzing shit.

51:38.329 --> 51:41.231
Enjoy that we got to see
those who had passed on.

51:41.232 --> 51:43.233
Enjoy and feel lucky that we got

51:43.234 --> 51:44.633
to say goodbye to them.

51:45.602 --> 51:46.469
Jesus.

51:46.470 --> 51:47.969
I'm going to bed.

52:09.556 --> 52:12.390
How the hell did
you get in here?

53:04.635 --> 53:06.034
Hey, can I come in?

53:08.671 --> 53:10.239
Sure.

53:10.240 --> 53:11.740
Going to bed soon.

53:11.741 --> 53:13.608
We'll just have
a chat before bed.

53:21.415 --> 53:22.816
You doing okay?

53:22.817 --> 53:23.650
Fine.

53:23.651 --> 53:24.651
Yeah.

53:27.821 --> 53:30.054
What was it like, seeing mom?

53:34.159 --> 53:35.994
You think I'm crazy.

53:35.995 --> 53:37.161
No I don't.

53:37.162 --> 53:38.896
I believe you
believe you saw her.

53:38.897 --> 53:39.996
She was real.

53:41.132 --> 53:43.366
She was sitting right
there in front of me.

53:46.703 --> 53:47.536
What happened?

53:47.537 --> 53:48.537
What did she say?

53:53.509 --> 53:55.476
She was exactly
how I remembered her

53:57.479 --> 53:58.578
the day she died.

53:59.581 --> 54:01.314
She wore the same clothing,

54:02.217 --> 54:04.417
the same tone in her voice.

54:04.418 --> 54:05.418
It was,

54:07.187 --> 54:08.253
it was mom.

54:14.060 --> 54:18.062
I just can't believe
it actually worked.

54:18.063 --> 54:19.729
Like it actually worked.

54:27.338 --> 54:29.737
I got to say goodbye to mom.

54:35.477 --> 54:38.111
I got one last moment with her.

Hello?

54:55.094 --> 54:56.560
Hey man, I'm still working.

55:32.459 --> 55:34.025
Francis.

55:46.504 --> 55:47.503
Amy?

55:50.107 --> 55:51.239
Amy is that you?

56:26.837 --> 56:30.139
Didn't expect to see
you up this late at night.

56:30.140 --> 56:31.640
I couldn't sleep.

56:31.641 --> 56:33.040
What happened?

56:36.378 --> 56:39.380
You're gonna think I'm crazy.

56:39.381 --> 56:40.647
Come on, tell me.

56:51.091 --> 56:52.091
I saw Isaac.

56:53.492 --> 56:55.093
I know it sounds
out of this world

56:55.094 --> 56:58.095
and in ways it is.

57:00.131 --> 57:01.798
But I actually saw him dad.

57:03.368 --> 57:04.400
What do you mean?

57:05.969 --> 57:08.471
We did this experiment.

57:08.472 --> 57:09.805
Talked to the dead.

57:10.908 --> 57:12.640
But it actually worked.

57:23.185 --> 57:24.184
Oh my God.

57:27.555 --> 57:28.988
Oh my God he's here.

57:28.989 --> 57:31.522
Dad, he's right
behind you, look.

57:39.731 --> 57:42.198
What on earth is the
matter with you Zara?

57:43.234 --> 57:45.001
Isaac's here!

57:45.002 --> 57:47.671
Zara, you're scaring me.

57:47.672 --> 57:49.938
Dad, he was right behind you!

58:02.851 --> 58:05.219
You have the cupcake I gave you.

58:05.220 --> 58:06.451
I missed you.

58:08.689 --> 58:09.721
I missed you too.

58:22.234 --> 58:23.900
What the hell's going on Zara?

58:38.881 --> 58:41.983
I'm not crazy,
he was right there!

58:41.984 --> 58:44.918
It was like I brought him
back from the dead with me!

58:44.919 --> 58:46.720
It was too real!

58:46.721 --> 58:48.988
Exactly how it felt like
when I was Brinking!

58:48.989 --> 58:51.590
What, do you think
he came back with you?

58:51.591 --> 58:53.492
Honestly, I don't know.

58:53.493 --> 58:55.093
But something
doesn't feel right.

58:55.094 --> 58:57.061
This isn't right, what we did!

58:57.062 --> 58:59.764
I think you're just paranoid.

58:59.765 --> 59:01.365
You've been dreaming
of this day for so long

59:01.366 --> 59:03.100
and finally it happens,

59:03.101 --> 59:05.569
your brain is playing
tricks on you Zara.

59:05.570 --> 59:07.303
Don't read into it.

59:07.304 --> 59:10.106
Look, go home, get
a good nights sleep.

59:10.107 --> 59:11.473
You've been through a lot.

59:12.442 --> 59:14.276
I mean we basically died today.

59:14.277 --> 59:17.312
This isn't my brain
playing tricks with me Jeff,

59:17.313 --> 59:18.914
this is real!

59:18.915 --> 59:20.214
Lily, you're a nurse!

59:20.215 --> 59:22.249
Come on, tell me,
what do you think?

59:22.250 --> 59:23.750
I don't know what to think.

59:25.120 --> 59:26.619
Maybe he's right.

59:26.620 --> 59:28.888
Just get some sleep and
see what happens tomorrow.

59:28.889 --> 59:30.156
See how you feel.

59:30.157 --> 59:31.657
I don't want to go home alone.

59:31.658 --> 59:33.325
I'm scared.

59:33.326 --> 59:35.594
And I saw it again.

59:35.595 --> 59:36.962
Saw what?

59:36.963 --> 59:38.429
That thing!

59:38.430 --> 59:41.032
That monster from
the other side!

59:41.033 --> 59:42.333
It was right there!

59:42.334 --> 59:43.966
It stood before me!

59:45.469 --> 59:47.170
Please tell me I'm
not the only one

59:47.171 --> 59:48.337
and I'm not crazy!

59:49.240 --> 59:51.039
What do I do?

59:53.209 --> 59:55.577
Look, I'll make a bed
up, you can stay here.

59:57.146 --> 59:58.079
Would you mind?

59:58.080 --> 59:59.446
No of course not, sleep here.

01:00:13.193 --> 01:00:14.993
Zara, I think she's asleep.

01:00:14.994 --> 01:00:16.093
She seems better.

01:00:17.530 --> 01:00:18.863
What are you doing up so late?

01:00:18.864 --> 01:00:21.432
I'm just finishing
off some editing.

01:00:21.433 --> 01:00:23.033
Jeff.

01:00:23.034 --> 01:00:24.568
You got to put off
uploading that anywhere.

01:00:24.569 --> 01:00:25.536
No, no, no, come on.

01:00:25.537 --> 01:00:27.070
Screw that.

01:00:27.071 --> 01:00:28.705
This was one of the
reasons why we did it.

01:00:28.706 --> 01:00:29.706
Come on.

01:00:30.774 --> 01:00:31.774
You wanna see it?

01:00:33.743 --> 01:00:36.712
Say yeah, I've been
working on it all evening.

01:00:36.713 --> 01:00:38.378
You are unbelievable.

01:04:22.268 --> 01:04:24.667
"Four teens found
dead after Brinking."

01:04:28.072 --> 01:04:30.139
Murders after Brinking.

"Grim Reaper cat

Don't you feel well?

01:06:18.797 --> 01:06:19.963
You're here.

What do you mean take me back?

01:06:27.605 --> 01:06:28.772
You shouldn't have left.

01:06:28.773 --> 01:06:30.639
And now the bad
man's coming for you.

01:06:31.441 --> 01:06:33.476
What bad man?

01:06:33.477 --> 01:06:35.243
You can't cheat death Zara.

01:07:39.765 --> 01:07:41.098
Are you okay?

01:07:42.201 --> 01:07:43.667
Zara?

01:07:43.668 --> 01:07:45.234
Zara are you okay?

01:07:46.204 --> 01:07:47.538
Zara?

01:07:47.539 --> 01:07:49.106
Zara?

01:07:49.107 --> 01:07:50.440
Zara?

01:07:50.441 --> 01:07:52.108
Zara, Zara!

01:07:52.109 --> 01:07:53.609
Zara, open up!

01:07:53.610 --> 01:07:54.677
Zara open up!

Zara!

01:08:02.484 --> 01:08:03.951
Zara?

01:08:03.952 --> 01:08:04.952
Zara!

01:08:05.821 --> 01:08:07.454
Zara where are you?

01:09:09.006 --> 01:09:10.240
Where have you been?

01:09:10.241 --> 01:09:12.308
I've been trying to
contact you for ages.

01:09:12.309 --> 01:09:14.176
I took some time off work.

01:09:14.178 --> 01:09:15.010
What's going on?

01:09:15.011 --> 01:09:16.011
What's up with you?

01:09:17.546 --> 01:09:18.546
Zara died.

01:09:20.082 --> 01:09:21.581
Police said it was suicide.

01:09:22.718 --> 01:09:24.984
She hung herself in our
bathroom last night.

01:09:26.587 --> 01:09:27.587
Fuck man.

01:09:28.423 --> 01:09:29.988
I knew she was seeing things.

01:09:31.192 --> 01:09:34.026
Wait a second.
Fuck man.

01:09:34.027 --> 01:09:36.462
Wait a second.

01:09:36.462 --> 01:09:39.964
You just said you thought
she was seeing things?

01:09:39.965 --> 01:09:40.965
What?

01:09:42.201 --> 01:09:43.634
Have you seen things Francis?

01:09:46.837 --> 01:09:47.837
Tell us.

01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:49.805
Something ain't right.

01:09:51.042 --> 01:09:52.774
I wasn't gonna say anything,

01:09:54.011 --> 01:09:55.011
but...

01:09:58.314 --> 01:10:01.048
Amy, I think I brought her back.

01:10:03.418 --> 01:10:04.852
What do you mean?

01:10:04.853 --> 01:10:05.886
I heard her voice man.

01:10:05.887 --> 01:10:07.520
When I was at work.

01:10:08.490 --> 01:10:09.655
It felt so real.

01:10:25.170 --> 01:10:29.004
Jeff, have you
experienced anything?

01:10:32.610 --> 01:10:33.610
Nothing.

01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:14.110
Jeff.

01:11:16.212 --> 01:11:17.712
You got a minute?

01:11:20.216 --> 01:11:21.216
Yeah.

01:11:22.751 --> 01:11:24.284
I got to show you something.

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:34.126
What is this?

01:11:38.398 --> 01:11:40.331
You a detective
now or something?

01:11:41.300 --> 01:11:44.235
They did it, three years ago.

01:11:44.236 --> 01:11:45.770
They did what you did.

01:11:45.771 --> 01:11:46.770
Brinking.

01:11:47.505 --> 01:11:48.505
Right.

01:11:49.641 --> 01:11:51.240
Now they're all dead.

01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:55.044
Not one of them stands this day.

01:11:55.045 --> 01:11:57.046
Neil Chambers, he
set himself on fire

01:11:57.047 --> 01:11:58.647
four days after the experiment.

01:12:00.016 --> 01:12:02.551
Sasha Fletcher, she was
last seen talking to herself

01:12:02.552 --> 01:12:04.419
and she jumped off a building

01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:06.120
claiming he was after her.

01:12:06.121 --> 01:12:07.121
The Grim Reaper.

01:12:08.523 --> 01:12:10.924
All four of them were friends.

01:12:10.925 --> 01:12:12.458
Daryl Jones, Nikki Mitchell,

01:12:12.459 --> 01:12:15.128
they were found dead
at a gas station.

01:12:15.129 --> 01:12:17.029
And the mystery
was how Daryl got

01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:18.462
stabbed with no attacker.

01:12:20.266 --> 01:12:22.367
And Nikki stabbed herself
in the gas station.

01:12:22.368 --> 01:12:23.900
What is your point?

01:12:25.237 --> 01:12:26.504
They did what you did.

01:12:26.505 --> 01:12:27.704
It's been done before.

01:12:28.807 --> 01:12:30.106
And there was always
someone chasing them.

01:12:30.107 --> 01:12:32.576
They felt like death
was following them.

01:12:32.577 --> 01:12:34.811
They all died the
week after Brinking.

01:12:34.812 --> 01:12:35.977
Just like Zara.

01:12:37.047 --> 01:12:38.047
You're crazy.

01:12:40.016 --> 01:12:41.016
I may be.

01:12:42.017 --> 01:12:43.750
But I'd rather be
safe than sorry.

01:13:03.970 --> 01:13:04.970
Francis.

01:13:07.038 --> 01:13:08.038
Amy.

01:13:11.742 --> 01:13:16.812
Amy.

01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:41.900
Amy.

01:13:53.511 --> 01:13:55.410
Are you coming back?

01:14:24.770 --> 01:14:26.636
Hi, May Frake?

01:14:27.673 --> 01:14:28.738
Can I help you?

01:14:43.585 --> 01:14:44.519
Amy.

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:45.952
Aren't you coming back?

01:14:49.123 --> 01:14:52.325
I'm so sorry for
what happened to you.

01:14:53.861 --> 01:14:56.227
I just wanted to
say goodbye to you.

01:14:58.465 --> 01:15:02.466
But once you leave this
world, you cannot return.

01:15:04.136 --> 01:15:05.503
You need to go.

01:15:05.504 --> 01:15:06.937
You need to be at peace.

01:15:08.173 --> 01:15:11.240
So you wish to
stay in this world?

01:15:12.944 --> 01:15:15.711
One day, we're going to reunite.

01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:18.046
This is where I belong.

01:15:21.818 --> 01:15:24.185
The dead can't
come back Francis.

01:15:29.324 --> 01:15:31.357
Amy...

01:15:31.358 --> 01:15:33.392
Once dead, your
soul belongs to him.

01:15:39.966 --> 01:15:42.100
You're not Amy are you?

01:15:43.502 --> 01:15:44.502
No.

01:15:46.271 --> 01:15:47.271
No.

01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:50.540
Don't drive so fast.

01:15:50.541 --> 01:15:51.541
Francis!

01:15:52.243 --> 01:15:53.243
Stop!

01:15:53.244 --> 01:15:54.677
Stop driving so fast!

01:15:55.679 --> 01:15:57.913
Please, I don't like it!

01:15:57.914 --> 01:15:59.348
Francis, this is dangerous!

01:15:59.349 --> 01:16:00.916
Stop, please!

01:16:00.917 --> 01:16:02.317
Oh my God!

01:16:02.318 --> 01:16:03.618
Oh my God the truck!

01:16:03.619 --> 01:16:05.586
Stop, stop!

01:16:09.190 --> 01:16:12.325
You killed me Francis.

01:16:14.161 --> 01:16:15.161
Murderer.

01:16:20.266 --> 01:16:21.665
Look behind you.

01:16:48.791 --> 01:16:53.259
I was wondering if you
could tell me what happened.

01:16:57.230 --> 01:16:59.264
The girl, Nikki.

01:17:01.334 --> 01:17:03.066
She was crazy.

01:17:04.103 --> 01:17:06.904
She came in here saying
it was after them.

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:10.239
Convinced someone
stood before her.

01:17:11.443 --> 01:17:12.276
What?

01:17:12.277 --> 01:17:13.277
Who did she see?

01:17:17.614 --> 01:17:18.680
I have no idea.

01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:22.883
But she was panicked.

01:17:25.988 --> 01:17:28.488
Terrified for her life
before she did it.

01:17:29.925 --> 01:17:31.958
Did it to herself.

01:17:33.461 --> 01:17:35.327
Did you really
think it was suicide?

01:17:39.766 --> 01:17:40.766
No.

01:17:42.602 --> 01:17:44.335
Something was there.

01:17:47.172 --> 01:17:49.206
Something did that to her.

01:17:52.577 --> 01:17:55.110
Something not from this world.

01:17:58.081 --> 01:18:00.782
She said you had to
cross over to stop it.

01:18:02.319 --> 01:18:03.550
Find the skull.

01:18:05.821 --> 01:18:08.288
But it was a bit
gibberish what she spoke.

01:18:41.951 --> 01:18:43.218
Francis?

01:18:43.219 --> 01:18:44.219
Jeff.

01:18:45.021 --> 01:18:46.454
It's not them.

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:48.022
It's not them dude.

01:18:48.023 --> 01:18:49.390
It's not them.

01:18:49.391 --> 01:18:51.692
Look Francis, what do
you mean it wasn't them?

01:18:51.693 --> 01:18:53.460
It's not our loved ones.

01:18:53.461 --> 01:18:56.195
It's not in the other dimension.

01:18:59.266 --> 01:19:01.266
Man, man, man I'm next.

01:19:03.970 --> 01:19:05.503
I'm next.

01:19:05.504 --> 01:19:06.504
Francis?

01:19:24.987 --> 01:19:26.288
Francis?

01:19:53.177 --> 01:19:55.511
The dead can't come back.

01:20:15.430 --> 01:20:16.430
Francis!

01:20:30.976 --> 01:20:32.943
Jeff, what is it?

01:20:32.944 --> 01:20:35.612
Lily, you
got to get back here now.

01:20:35.613 --> 01:20:37.313
Francis, he's next.

01:20:37.314 --> 01:20:38.915
Jack, the Reaper.

01:20:38.916 --> 01:20:40.882
The car garage lady
just told me that,

01:20:42.251 --> 01:20:45.120
she said Nikki, she said
the Reaper was after her.

01:20:45.121 --> 01:20:46.822
And she also said
about the skull.

01:20:46.823 --> 01:20:48.255
And online it said
that the skull

01:20:48.256 --> 01:20:51.091
was from a God, stolen
from a God Orcus.

01:20:52.494 --> 01:20:54.560
It said the skull was a
portal to the other world.

01:20:56.697 --> 01:20:57.997
We need to go back there.

01:20:59.499 --> 01:21:01.734
I got to go back to
where it all began.

01:21:01.735 --> 01:21:03.235
The graveyard.

01:21:03.236 --> 01:21:04.770
Francis is already dead.

01:21:04.771 --> 01:21:06.337
Does this mean... Don't.

01:21:06.338 --> 01:21:07.438
Stop.

01:21:07.439 --> 01:21:08.573
Stop.

01:21:08.574 --> 01:21:10.375
We can win this.

01:21:10.376 --> 01:21:13.076
We can win this okay.

01:21:13.077 --> 01:21:15.679
We just got to go
to the other world.

01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:17.314
We got to stop him.

01:21:17.315 --> 01:21:19.815
We get the skull and destroy it.

01:21:19.816 --> 01:21:21.083
It's the only way
he can get us under

01:21:21.084 --> 01:21:22.651
and kill us on the other side.

01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:25.019
Meet me at the graveyard.

01:21:37.498 --> 01:21:38.864
He'll be coming for you.

01:21:40.167 --> 01:21:41.433
To bring you back to me.

01:21:44.971 --> 01:21:46.671
Jeff, hurry up!

01:22:02.519 --> 01:22:03.818
What are we doing here?

01:22:05.655 --> 01:22:07.021
You're gonna put me under.

01:22:07.022 --> 01:22:07.855
I can stop this.

01:22:07.856 --> 01:22:08.856
What?

01:22:09.625 --> 01:22:10.491
You're gonna put me under.

01:22:10.492 --> 01:22:13.660
The lady said that's
what they did.

01:22:13.661 --> 01:22:14.895
You got to destroy the skull.

01:22:14.896 --> 01:22:16.329
That's the way to
break the curse.

01:22:16.330 --> 01:22:18.798
How do you know all this?

01:22:18.799 --> 01:22:20.599
I just know we
had to do something.

01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:23.402
Online it said you
go under to stop it

01:22:23.403 --> 01:22:25.270
and they said,
the other victims,

01:22:25.271 --> 01:22:26.504
they wanted to go under

01:22:26.505 --> 01:22:27.405
but I guess they
didn't have anyone

01:22:27.406 --> 01:22:29.240
to go under for them.

01:22:29.241 --> 01:22:30.707
But you have me.

01:22:31.810 --> 01:22:35.012
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

01:22:35.013 --> 01:22:36.246
You are not doing this.

01:22:36.247 --> 01:22:38.114
What if it goes wrong
and it comes after you?

01:22:38.115 --> 01:22:39.248
Jeff, I'm not losing you!

01:22:39.249 --> 01:22:40.917
Lily...
You have to put me under!

01:22:40.918 --> 01:22:41.851
Please, no!

01:22:41.852 --> 01:22:44.753
Listen to me, put me under.

01:22:44.754 --> 01:22:46.120
Do this for me, not you!

01:22:55.930 --> 01:22:58.898
For the powers that see,
for the powers that be,

01:22:58.899 --> 01:23:01.800
let them be present and
let us cross over in peace

01:23:01.801 --> 01:23:03.034
and return in light.

01:23:04.571 --> 01:23:07.238
By the powers that see,
by the powers that be,

01:23:07.239 --> 01:23:10.108
let them be present and
let us cross over in peace

01:23:10.109 --> 01:23:11.508
and return in light.

01:23:51.009 --> 01:23:52.510
It's okay.

01:23:52.511 --> 01:23:54.344
It's okay, it's okay.

01:23:56.814 --> 01:23:57.814
It's okay.

01:23:59.683 --> 01:24:00.683
It's okay.

01:24:02.519 --> 01:24:03.519
It's okay.

01:24:35.213 --> 01:24:36.213
I'm sorry.

01:25:06.773 --> 01:25:07.773
Hello.

01:25:09.708 --> 01:25:10.708
Hello?

01:25:17.348 --> 01:25:18.815
Zara.

01:25:18.816 --> 01:25:19.816
Zara.

01:25:22.118 --> 01:25:23.219
Zara.

01:25:26.356 --> 01:25:27.521
It's alright.

01:26:26.139 --> 01:26:27.139
You're not my mom.

01:26:29.708 --> 01:26:31.041
You came to see me too?

01:26:32.678 --> 01:26:34.710
Ready to join your brother?

01:27:11.710 --> 01:27:12.710
Go away.

01:27:14.613 --> 01:27:17.846
Stop fucking with my head!

01:27:24.521 --> 01:27:25.521
Get away from her.

01:27:26.723 --> 01:27:31.792
Get away from her!

01:28:00.584 --> 01:28:02.085
Lily, Lily, Lily come on!

01:28:02.086 --> 01:28:03.519
Lily you got to wake up!

01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:04.520
Lily come on!

01:28:04.521 --> 01:28:05.520
You got to wake up Lily!

01:28:05.521 --> 01:28:06.521
Come on!

01:28:07.423 --> 01:28:09.491
You got to wake up
Lily, come on, come on.

01:28:09.492 --> 01:28:10.492
Come on Lily.

01:28:16.732 --> 01:28:18.231
You're not my mom.

01:28:18.232 --> 01:28:19.232
I'm not?

01:28:21.969 --> 01:28:23.034
Give me the skull.

01:28:26.339 --> 01:28:27.805
You've come for this?

01:28:30.676 --> 01:28:31.676
Give it to me.

01:28:35.146 --> 01:28:38.815
No, no, no, not yours.

01:28:38.816 --> 01:28:39.882
Give it to me.

01:28:40.852 --> 01:28:42.650
You left me to die Lily.

01:28:44.121 --> 01:28:46.022
You let me out of
that house that day

01:28:46.023 --> 01:28:48.990
without a care in the world.

01:28:48.991 --> 01:28:50.891
You knew I'd been drinking.

01:28:52.395 --> 01:28:53.394
You saw me.

01:28:54.562 --> 01:28:55.562
Stop it.

01:28:56.765 --> 01:29:00.232
You saw me downing
those drinks that morning.

01:29:01.535 --> 01:29:03.802
Now what kind of daughter
does that make you?

01:29:04.605 --> 01:29:05.836
You're not my mom.

01:29:06.939 --> 01:29:08.607
I look like her though don't I?

01:29:08.608 --> 01:29:09.441
Where is she?

01:29:09.442 --> 01:29:10.909
Where's my mom?

01:29:10.910 --> 01:29:12.709
Burning in fucking hell.

01:29:13.678 --> 01:29:14.844
She says hello.

01:29:15.847 --> 01:29:19.314
She is looking
forward to seeing you.

01:29:23.020 --> 01:29:24.019
Come on!

01:29:25.188 --> 01:29:26.522
Wake up, wake up.

01:29:26.523 --> 01:29:27.623
Wake up Lily!

01:29:27.624 --> 01:29:28.624
Wake up.

01:29:36.330 --> 01:29:37.496
Get away from me!

01:29:40.334 --> 01:29:41.834
Get away from me.

01:29:49.875 --> 01:29:53.411
You and your brother, murderers.

01:29:53.412 --> 01:29:55.212
But then again,

01:29:55.213 --> 01:29:58.514
ain't no one want
children like you two.

01:30:00.217 --> 01:30:01.450
Disgusting

01:30:02.653 --> 01:30:03.819
and worthless.

01:30:06.622 --> 01:30:09.591
What makes you
even more pathetic

01:30:09.592 --> 01:30:14.260
is that you knew exactly
what you saw that morning.

01:30:15.397 --> 01:30:18.897
You let her drive
herself to work

01:30:20.267 --> 01:30:22.835
even after she asked
you for a lift.

01:30:26.139 --> 01:30:29.173
Couldn't tell your brother
that though, could ya?

01:30:30.876 --> 01:30:32.075
Too ashamed huh?

01:30:34.980 --> 01:30:38.747
Let mom go off,
off her face to work

01:30:41.419 --> 01:30:42.585
knowing this.

01:30:46.957 --> 01:30:47.957
You

01:30:49.892 --> 01:30:50.892
wanted

01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:52.660
her

01:30:54.296 --> 01:30:55.295
dead.

01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:01.400
Is that why you
didn't bring yourself

01:31:01.401 --> 01:31:02.401
the first time?

01:31:03.637 --> 01:31:05.972
Scared to come face-to-face

01:31:05.973 --> 01:31:08.205
with the mess you created?

01:31:09.375 --> 01:31:10.608
Please stop!

01:31:13.645 --> 01:31:14.978
Mommy killer.

01:31:17.015 --> 01:31:19.215
You really can't wait
to see her face huh!

01:32:17.766 --> 01:32:18.766
Lily no!

01:32:19.701 --> 01:32:21.568
Lily, it's me!

01:32:21.569 --> 01:32:22.535
It's me!

01:32:22.536 --> 01:32:23.635
It's mom!

01:32:25.539 --> 01:32:26.538
It's me.

01:32:28.274 --> 01:32:29.441
I forgive you.

01:32:29.442 --> 01:32:30.775
I never blamed you.

01:32:31.611 --> 01:32:33.710
I knew it wasn't your fault!

01:32:35.314 --> 01:32:37.681
I should've stayed
home that day.

01:32:38.816 --> 01:32:41.383
I shouldn't have relied
on you with a life.

01:32:44.921 --> 01:32:47.255
That's why you took
up nursing right?

01:32:48.058 --> 01:32:50.024
To heal it wasn't pain.

01:33:10.009 --> 01:33:11.009
Lily.

01:33:12.278 --> 01:33:13.278
Lily.

01:33:21.218 --> 01:33:22.218
No.

01:33:53.012 --> 01:33:54.245
No, no, no!

01:34:08.258 --> 01:34:09.191
Jeff.

01:34:09.192 --> 01:34:10.958
Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, wake me up!

01:34:12.061 --> 01:34:13.094
Wake me up Jeff.

01:34:13.095 --> 01:34:14.229
Wake me up!

01:34:14.230 --> 01:34:15.796
Wake me up Jeff!

01:34:28.308 --> 01:34:29.308
Hey Lil.

01:34:31.177 --> 01:34:33.678
What are you doing here?

01:34:33.679 --> 01:34:35.779
I'm sorry I was such a fuck up.

01:34:39.284 --> 01:34:40.616
I love you though.

01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:43.552
I always will.

01:34:45.089 --> 01:34:47.488
Jeff, what are you saying?

01:35:11.911 --> 01:35:12.911
Jeff, Jeff.

01:35:13.846 --> 01:35:15.313
Jeff!

01:35:15.314 --> 01:35:16.313
Jeff, Jeff!

01:35:18.817 --> 01:35:19.817
Jeff, Jeff!

01:35:21.019 --> 01:35:22.652
Jeff, Jeff!

01:35:22.653 --> 01:35:24.020
Jeff come on!

01:35:24.021 --> 01:35:25.321
Come on Jeff!

01:35:25.322 --> 01:35:26.322
Jeff!

01:35:58.384 --> 01:36:00.283
Come on Jeff, please.

01:36:00.284 --> 01:36:02.319
Please, please, please!

01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:04.020
Please wake up!

01:36:04.021 --> 01:36:05.320
Please wake up!

01:36:06.089 --> 01:36:10.192
Please!

01:36:10.193 --> 01:36:11.525
Please wake up!

01:36:16.399 --> 01:36:17.398
Please.

01:36:23.437 --> 01:36:24.503
Please wake.

01:36:28.142 --> 01:36:29.141
Jeff!

01:36:36.681 --> 01:36:38.081
Oh my God.

01:36:38.082 --> 01:36:39.522
Who said you can't
cheat death twice?

01:36:44.588 --> 01:36:47.790
I love you so much.

01:36:47.791 --> 01:36:49.290
I love you too.

01:36:53.896 --> 01:36:55.462
I'm gonna need a hospital.
