WEBVTT

00:07.859 --> 00:09.550
Oh, sorry. I'll make some
more coffee right now.

00:09.551 --> 00:11.319
No worries. I'll do it.

00:12.130 --> 00:14.031
'Cause you don't want my
grubby peasant hands on it?

00:14.066 --> 00:16.634
No, silly Billy.

00:16.668 --> 00:18.636
I can do it myself. Boop.

00:20.741 --> 00:22.642
Okay, I'm still in bed dreaming,
and I'm gonna be late for work.

00:22.676 --> 00:24.377
(Laughs)

00:24.411 --> 00:25.862
Elliot, you're in a pretty good mood,

00:25.863 --> 00:27.380
considering your big 4-0 is tomorrow.

00:27.414 --> 00:29.215
I thought you might be freaking out.

00:29.250 --> 00:31.625
More like getting my freak on.

00:32.890 --> 00:34.269
With Andre.

00:35.495 --> 00:38.897
This is the first time I've ever
had a boyfriend on my birthday.

00:38.932 --> 00:41.033
39 years of sorrow,

00:41.067 --> 00:43.802
and I finally get to celebrate my birthday

00:43.837 --> 00:45.537
in my birthday suit.

00:48.408 --> 00:50.509
Oh my God, I love Elliot with a boyfriend.

00:50.543 --> 00:52.344
When he's happy, I'm happy.

00:52.378 --> 00:54.379
And maybe we'll even be
friends, which would be great,

00:54.414 --> 00:56.003
because friends don't tell friends

00:56.004 --> 00:57.553
they look like dime store hookers.

00:59.185 --> 01:01.987
Friends say, "Hey, you
look cute in that dress."

01:02.021 --> 01:03.755
Hey, cute dress.

01:05.024 --> 01:07.173
Okay, that's it. We've got
to keep this love train going.

01:07.174 --> 01:08.594
I'm calling Andre. Elliot's about to have

01:08.628 --> 01:10.279
the most romantic birthday dinner ever.

01:10.280 --> 01:12.598
That's a pretty good idea.

01:12.632 --> 01:14.466
Too bad it's not gonna top my present.

01:14.501 --> 01:15.815
Because I make the most money here,

01:15.816 --> 01:18.110
and I was called a creative
genius by a top publication.

01:19.372 --> 01:21.173
Oh, was it <i>bragging monthly?</i>

01:22.362 --> 01:24.687
What's that? You want to see
what it is? Okay, I'll get it.

01:26.946 --> 01:29.715
Hi, can I speak to Andre
of flowers by Andre?

01:29.749 --> 01:31.984
Hey, Andre, it's Gabi.

01:32.967 --> 01:34.968
Yes, the annoying blonde cook.

01:35.555 --> 01:38.491
Listen, I'm surprising
Elliot for his 40th birthday

01:38.492 --> 01:41.360
with a romantic dinner, and
obviously I want you to be his date.

01:41.361 --> 01:43.559
Okay, great. Check your
schedule, get back to me.

01:43.560 --> 01:44.396
What?

01:44.430 --> 01:45.792
- Schwah!
- (Gasps)

01:48.134 --> 01:49.564
Oh my God.

01:49.565 --> 01:53.038
- Elliot and Andre. That's so cute.
- Yep

01:53.072 --> 01:55.774
I bet this makes you feel
pretty lousy about your gift.

01:55.808 --> 01:57.743
Elliot: Oh my God!

02:00.680 --> 02:04.483
Andre just found out I'm turning 40
instead of 32 and broke up with me.

02:04.747 --> 02:05.814
Both: What?

02:06.049 --> 02:08.951
This is officially the worst birthday ever!

02:10.523 --> 02:12.391
Oh my God!

Don't worry, Elliot.

02:36.382 --> 02:38.007
Andre's not the last guy you'll ever date.

02:38.008 --> 02:38.795
Yeah.

02:38.907 --> 02:40.708
I'm sure you'll get dumped by tons of guys.

02:41.654 --> 02:44.323
I've only ever loved three men in my life.

02:44.357 --> 02:47.253
Andre, my college crush Alan,

02:47.254 --> 02:48.493
and Adam Levine.

02:49.762 --> 02:51.496
And I know it sounds crazy,

02:51.531 --> 02:53.465
but Andre's the only one who loved me back.

02:54.634 --> 02:56.268
(Phone chirps)

03:00.340 --> 03:01.607
Hey...

03:02.642 --> 03:05.243
I know this might not be the
best time to bring this up,

03:05.278 --> 03:08.639
but the guys from Wired are coming
to photograph my desk tomorrow

03:08.640 --> 03:10.415
for <i>the desk for success</i> column.

03:10.450 --> 03:11.918
Are we ready?

03:13.586 --> 03:15.554
- No.
- So...

03:15.588 --> 03:17.689
And I mean this in the nicest possible way,

03:17.724 --> 03:19.658
when do you think we'll be ready?

03:20.746 --> 03:23.180
How about when someone loves me again?

03:23.181 --> 03:24.563
So never!

03:27.600 --> 03:30.235
Good morning, beautiful people!

03:31.270 --> 03:32.638
(Clears throat loudly)

03:32.672 --> 03:35.894
I said what a good morning it is.

03:38.019 --> 03:40.379
Andre broke up with Elliot
because he's turning 40.

03:41.681 --> 03:43.705
Out of all the reasons,
that's what he picked?

03:45.618 --> 03:48.253
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.

03:48.287 --> 03:50.834
You want to hear a story
about somebody else's pain?

03:51.109 --> 03:52.698
That always cheers you up.

03:54.527 --> 03:56.428
My ex-husband Coleman,

03:56.462 --> 03:58.330
who dumped me for a younger woman,

03:58.364 --> 04:00.440
just got dumped by a younger woman...

04:01.501 --> 04:03.468
At the altar. Uh!

04:05.438 --> 04:07.506
At least he got to the altar.

04:07.540 --> 04:10.059
How did Andre find out my real age anyway?

04:10.060 --> 04:11.785
The only people who knew were you three.

04:12.512 --> 04:13.512
Which one of you told him?

04:13.546 --> 04:14.546
Not me.

04:14.580 --> 04:15.986
I thought you were 50.

04:19.317 --> 04:21.253
I am so sorry. It was me.

04:21.286 --> 04:22.764
Oh my God, it was you!

04:24.390 --> 04:26.291
Listen, Elliot, I'm really sorry.

04:26.292 --> 04:27.742
I was just trying to do
something nice for you.

04:27.743 --> 04:30.128
It was gonna be a surprise.
We were gonna be friends.

04:30.163 --> 04:32.197
Well, you ruined that, didn't you?

04:32.231 --> 04:34.132
I will never forgive you, Gabi Diamond!

04:36.200 --> 04:37.531
He just needs some time.

04:37.575 --> 04:38.800
Elliot: Never!

04:44.010 --> 04:45.711
How you doin'?

04:46.746 --> 04:48.780
My life's over.

04:48.815 --> 04:50.615
You don't understand.

04:50.650 --> 04:52.484
40 is 80 in gay years.

04:52.518 --> 04:54.453
Please. I don't understand?

04:54.487 --> 04:56.800
Men my age want women in their 20s.

04:56.801 --> 04:58.323
Which means the only man I can get

04:58.357 --> 04:59.458
is 120.

05:00.023 --> 05:02.227
Great. I'm in the same

05:02.261 --> 05:04.687
fat, old boat as you.

05:07.066 --> 05:08.333
That's right.

05:08.367 --> 05:10.335
You know what I do when I'm feeling old?

05:10.369 --> 05:13.038
I get my lashes done,
I freshen up the weave,

05:13.072 --> 05:14.873
I buy new lipstick...

05:14.907 --> 05:16.742
I'm gay, but not that gay.

05:17.810 --> 05:19.878
Oh, I just got an idea.

05:19.912 --> 05:21.813
You know my ex Coleman

05:21.848 --> 05:23.992
is the top plastic surgeon in the city.

05:24.518 --> 05:26.451
You think I need plastic surgery?

05:26.486 --> 05:28.353
I could pass for 32.

05:28.387 --> 05:30.322
And I could pass for Taylor Swift.

05:32.391 --> 05:34.159
Let's see.

05:34.193 --> 05:35.227
Over here...

05:36.262 --> 05:38.263
(Gasps) I'm beautiful.

05:39.432 --> 05:41.333
(Gasps) Okay.

05:41.367 --> 05:43.201
I'm gonna call Coleman right now.

05:43.236 --> 05:45.137
Yes. Wait, no.

05:45.171 --> 05:47.806
I can't make you deal
with that cheater for me.

05:47.840 --> 05:49.975
Oh, that's ridiculous.

05:50.009 --> 05:51.743
I'll take you myself.

05:51.778 --> 05:54.546
- I want you to be happy.
- Since when?

05:54.580 --> 05:56.715
Since it's your birthday.

05:56.749 --> 06:00.097
And since Coleman got dumped,
you want to rub it in his face?

06:00.098 --> 06:02.220
Isn't that how you teach a dog a lesson?

06:04.257 --> 06:06.224
Okay, I think I've figured out a way...

06:06.259 --> 06:07.626
To help me?

06:07.660 --> 06:09.871
Last month, Wired featured
Elon Musk at his hover-desk.

06:09.872 --> 06:12.030
Oh yeah! I saw that. That was really cool!

06:12.064 --> 06:13.365
I'm not helping, am I?

06:13.399 --> 06:15.539
Look, I know this might not
seem like a big deal to you,

06:15.540 --> 06:17.389
but everybody in my
business reads this column.

06:17.390 --> 06:19.170
Venture capitalists, potential clients,

06:19.171 --> 06:20.939
- software developers...
- So you want to seem cool?

06:20.940 --> 06:22.395
- Yes!
- Don't worry, okay?

06:22.396 --> 06:24.132
You're gonna have him back
in time for your shoot.

06:24.133 --> 06:27.132
I figured out the perfect "I'm sorry
I ruined your birthday" present.

06:27.664 --> 06:30.012
His parents know he's 40, right?

06:30.516 --> 06:32.540
- Why wouldn't they?
- So here's my plan.

06:32.541 --> 06:34.741
Since Elliot rarely gets a
chance to see his parents,

06:34.759 --> 06:37.255
I'm inviting them to a
five-course Korean dinner.

06:37.290 --> 06:39.291
He'll love that. Here, let's call them now.

06:39.325 --> 06:40.225
Okay.

06:43.740 --> 06:46.540
Hi, Mr. Park? It's Gabi
Diamond. I work with Elliot.

06:47.967 --> 06:49.483
Yes, the annoying blonde cook.

06:50.870 --> 06:53.605
So anyway, Elliot's
boyfriend broke up with him

06:53.639 --> 06:55.376
and I don't want him to
be alone on his big day,

06:55.420 --> 06:57.542
so I was wondering if
maybe you could fly in

06:57.577 --> 06:58.999
for a birthday dinner tomorrow night.

07:00.049 --> 07:02.447
Okay, great. Check with
Mrs. Park. Call me back.

07:03.716 --> 07:05.891
So, where are you planning
on having this dinner?

07:05.892 --> 07:08.186
I thought you'd never ask. Your terrace.

07:09.288 --> 07:11.557
No problem. And I want
to pay for the dinner.

07:11.558 --> 07:13.425
Oh, but you're already
paying for their flights.

07:13.459 --> 07:15.771
Elliot: Oh my God!

07:16.684 --> 07:19.130
Someone just outed me to my parents!

07:19.796 --> 07:20.966
Wait.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.834
Your parents didn't know you were gay?

07:22.869 --> 07:24.870
No. They're super traditional.

07:24.904 --> 07:26.638
They don't even like sex with each other.

07:27.940 --> 07:30.575
- How the hell did they find out?
- Gabi did it.

07:31.453 --> 07:34.034
- I need him. He's the desk whisperer.
- You know what, Josh?

07:34.409 --> 07:36.414
I just thought of the
perfect birthday gift.

07:36.449 --> 07:39.384
Tell that dime store hooker
to get out of my face.

07:39.418 --> 07:41.122
- Okay, can I just...
- Gabi, home.

07:42.188 --> 07:43.288
Bye.

07:43.322 --> 07:45.544
And that cute dress? I lied!

07:51.135 --> 07:53.641
Oh. You're home early.

07:53.703 --> 07:55.022
What'd you do?

07:55.478 --> 07:57.822
I caused Elliot's boyfriend
to break up with him,

07:57.860 --> 07:59.185
and then I outed him to his parents,

07:59.186 --> 08:01.697
and if I keep talking like
this, everything sounds great!

08:02.536 --> 08:04.415
- Holy crap.
- Yeah.

08:04.416 --> 08:07.097
Oh yeah. And did I mention
it's his birthday tomorrow?

08:07.098 --> 08:09.319
Oh... wait. So, Josh fired you?

08:09.420 --> 08:11.906
No, Sofia, Josh didn't fire me.

08:11.907 --> 08:14.876
We just have a mutual agreement that
things are better when I'm not around.

08:16.394 --> 08:17.976
How do I fix this?

08:17.977 --> 08:20.569
Um, okay, well, you
destroyed his relationship,

08:20.570 --> 08:21.989
you told his parents he was gay.

08:21.990 --> 08:24.127
W-when do you find time to cook?

08:26.070 --> 08:28.866
Hey, I know. I'll just
find Elliot a new boyfriend.

08:28.867 --> 08:31.054
He said he's only loved
three men in his entire life.

08:31.242 --> 08:33.366
Andre, Adam Levine,

08:33.368 --> 08:35.369
and some guy named Alan from college.

08:35.613 --> 08:37.647
That's great. So we find Alan from college.

08:37.682 --> 08:39.482
I was gonna say that!

08:40.684 --> 08:42.652
If you don't let me get
there, I'm never gonna learn.

08:44.178 --> 08:45.810
Okay, all right.

08:46.657 --> 08:49.226
- I'm on Elliot's Facebook page.
- Okay.

08:49.293 --> 08:50.961
(Gaps) There's only two Alans.

08:50.995 --> 08:53.063
Alan Thicke and Alan Lowenstein.

08:53.097 --> 08:56.066
I know. It's Alan Lowenstein

08:56.100 --> 08:59.352
because he went to Berkeley and that
is also where Elliot went to college.

08:59.353 --> 09:02.083
Yes, that's the only
reason we know which Alan.

09:06.878 --> 09:10.961
Well, today is officially your birthday.

09:10.986 --> 09:12.993
Happy Birthday. See?

09:14.719 --> 09:17.220
It's my face instead of Andre's.

09:18.833 --> 09:20.667
It represents our friendship...

09:20.770 --> 09:22.071
boss, publicist.

09:22.393 --> 09:24.370
Always there for each other.

09:25.770 --> 09:29.065
Stop. I've decided not
to celebrate my birthday.

09:29.100 --> 09:30.867
Aw.

09:30.902 --> 09:32.836
I get it, big guy.

09:32.870 --> 09:34.921
You want to focus on the
photo shoot with Wired.

09:36.367 --> 09:38.575
Josh, I'm gonna be able to focus better

09:38.609 --> 09:40.677
after my cosmetic surgery consultation.

09:40.711 --> 09:42.479
What?

09:42.513 --> 09:44.314
Elliot, you don't need plastic surgery.

09:44.348 --> 09:46.216
We'll let Dr. James decide that.

09:46.250 --> 09:48.118
Yolanda's ex-husband?

09:48.151 --> 09:49.914
Yes, she got me an appointment.

09:49.915 --> 09:51.995
- She's taking me right now.
- Oh!

09:52.190 --> 09:54.291
She wants to see him because
she heard he's single.

09:54.325 --> 09:56.159
No, she doesn't like him.

09:56.194 --> 09:58.228
She just wants to rub
the breakup in his face.

09:59.087 --> 10:01.262
I don't think that's what
she wants to rub in his face.

10:02.550 --> 10:05.068
- You ready?
- Look, I see what's going on here.

10:05.102 --> 10:07.329
You're using Elliot as
an excuse to see Coleman.

10:07.390 --> 10:09.454
Oh, please. Look at his saggy face.

10:09.455 --> 10:10.742
He looks like a rescue pug.

10:12.677 --> 10:14.611
That's never gonna get rescued.

10:14.645 --> 10:16.613
Yolanda.

10:17.682 --> 10:19.112
You worked day and night

10:19.113 --> 10:20.962
for years to put Coleman
through medical school.

10:20.963 --> 10:22.193
The minute he became a doctor,

10:22.194 --> 10:23.475
he ran off with his assistant.

10:23.476 --> 10:25.944
And now it is payback time.

10:25.945 --> 10:27.326
He is single and vulnerable.

10:27.350 --> 10:29.146
I am gonna turn on the charm,

10:29.147 --> 10:30.881
and get him to take me out,

10:30.882 --> 10:33.196
and right when I got him
wrapped around my finger,

10:33.197 --> 10:36.099
I'm gonna dump his sorry
ass like he dumped mine.

10:36.133 --> 10:37.968
Ha ha.

10:41.973 --> 10:44.941
I can't believe I found you,
Alan. Elliot's gonna be so excited.

10:44.942 --> 10:46.429
You think he's gonna be excited.

10:46.430 --> 10:48.578
I've had a crush on him
since freshman orientation.

10:48.613 --> 10:51.007
In fact, that's the way I
discovered my orientation.

10:51.982 --> 10:53.865
That's funny. You're funny.

10:53.866 --> 10:56.601
Funny? That's what people
say when someone's not cute.

10:56.681 --> 10:58.848
Oh God, I'm so nervous
I'm schvitzing up a storm.

10:59.467 --> 11:02.402
I don't know what schvitzing is,
but I can't tell you're doing it.

11:03.294 --> 11:05.128
Don't worry. You're gonna be fine.

11:05.162 --> 11:07.130
- How lucky is it that you're single?
- Yeah.

11:07.164 --> 11:09.032
I'm like a lotto winner.

11:09.066 --> 11:11.460
I can't believe Elliot's still single.

11:11.461 --> 11:12.628
He's such a catch.

11:12.870 --> 11:14.923
Elliot... Park?

11:16.019 --> 11:18.341
You know, I wish you would've
given me a few weeks' notice.

11:18.376 --> 11:19.676
I would've lost five pounds.

11:19.710 --> 11:21.511
Eh, who am I kidding?

11:21.545 --> 11:22.479
(Dings)

11:26.740 --> 11:27.840
Shh.

11:27.950 --> 11:29.717
Oh, I get it. You want to surprise him.

11:29.875 --> 11:31.452
Surprise him by doing something right.

11:31.453 --> 11:32.386
Wait here.

11:36.127 --> 11:37.060
Gabi.

11:37.094 --> 11:38.028
(Gasps loudly)

11:39.030 --> 11:40.897
Elliot cannot come home and find you here.

11:40.932 --> 11:43.500
Oh good. He's gone.
Listen, I have another plan.

11:43.534 --> 11:45.602
I think you're using the word "plan" wrong.

11:45.636 --> 11:48.405
This one's a winner. Okay, meet...

11:49.707 --> 11:52.642
Alan Lowenstein, Elliot's
long lost college love.

11:52.677 --> 11:54.949
He knows his real age, knows he's gay,

11:54.950 --> 11:56.413
and he's still single.

11:56.414 --> 11:58.148
Why do you keep saying that?

12:00.284 --> 12:02.886
And you're not allergic to any medications?

12:02.920 --> 12:04.988
If I am, I don't care.

12:05.022 --> 12:06.803
Dope me up, peel this off,

12:06.804 --> 12:08.605
and slap a new face on me.

12:10.384 --> 12:13.863
Just thought I'd poke my head in
and say a quick hey to Coleman.

12:13.898 --> 12:16.833
Yolanda, you didn't
tell me you were coming.

12:16.867 --> 12:18.935
Quick, go check the tires on my Porsche.

12:18.970 --> 12:21.771
(Both laugh)

12:21.806 --> 12:23.406
(Softly) No, seriously, go check.

12:24.709 --> 12:26.710
Wow, look at you.

12:26.744 --> 12:29.646
If I didn't know better, I would think
you went to one of my competitors.

12:29.680 --> 12:31.915
- Oh, stop.
- Yeah, stop.

12:31.916 --> 12:34.009
Because if you think she
looks good, I'm out of here.

12:34.809 --> 12:36.678
Sorry. I just got a little distracted

12:36.679 --> 12:37.997
by those big beautiful...

12:38.255 --> 12:39.856
Eyes.

12:39.890 --> 12:42.859
You always did get lost in my... eyes.

12:42.893 --> 12:44.919
We get it. You're
talking about her boobies.

12:47.031 --> 12:49.799
It's like taking candy from a baby.

12:49.834 --> 12:51.768
So, Elliot, I think the first thing to do

12:51.802 --> 12:53.536
is a subtle facelift.

12:53.571 --> 12:55.282
The hell with subtle.

12:55.283 --> 12:58.274
I want to get pulled so tight
I look like I'm sky-diving.

13:01.156 --> 13:02.412
So, how you been, Yo-Yo?

13:02.446 --> 13:04.447
Oh, can't complain, Co-Co.

13:04.482 --> 13:07.183
I was so sorry to hear about your breakup.

13:08.986 --> 13:11.187
If Yo-Yo and Co-Co
are done flirting,

13:11.222 --> 13:13.757
El-El wants to look like
the Korean Matt Damon.

13:14.564 --> 13:17.093
Man, I wish I didn't have
another patient after this.

13:17.128 --> 13:19.562
Why? Do I need that much work?

13:19.597 --> 13:21.664
I'd like to take you to dinner tonight.

13:21.699 --> 13:23.833
- That would be fine.
- Excellent.

13:23.868 --> 13:25.668
This is gonna be fun.

13:25.703 --> 13:27.737
Oh, you have no idea.

13:27.772 --> 13:29.639
Hey, here's an idea.

13:29.673 --> 13:31.541
Quit kissing her ass
and start lifting mine.

13:36.347 --> 13:38.114
Okay, that was the doorman.

13:38.149 --> 13:39.149
Elliot's on his way up right now.

13:39.183 --> 13:40.150
How do I look?

13:40.184 --> 13:42.952
One button unbuttoned? Or two? Or three?

13:42.987 --> 13:44.721
Who am I? Usher? I'll do one.

13:47.124 --> 13:49.793
You look adorable, Alan Lowenstein.

13:49.827 --> 13:52.460
Now you sit right there, and I'm
gonna go meet him in the hall.

13:52.461 --> 13:53.428
(Quietly) Okay.

13:53.429 --> 13:54.362
(Dings)

13:55.766 --> 13:58.601
I did not invite you to my birthday.

13:58.636 --> 14:02.377
But you will invite me to your "wedding."

14:03.574 --> 14:05.241
I have a birthday surprise for you.

14:05.276 --> 14:07.143
What'd you do this time, kill my cat?

14:08.446 --> 14:11.247
No. Do you remember
your college crush Alan?

14:11.282 --> 14:13.283
- Well, he's here.
- What?

14:13.317 --> 14:15.018
Yeah, you heard me, birthday boy.

14:15.052 --> 14:16.886
He's sitting on the other
side of that door right now,

14:16.921 --> 14:18.021
and he's so excited to see you.

14:18.055 --> 14:19.789
- Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

14:19.824 --> 14:20.890
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

14:20.925 --> 14:22.659
How did you find Alan O'Shay?

14:25.282 --> 14:26.982
O'Shay?

14:26.983 --> 14:28.116
Oh,...

14:33.145 --> 14:35.146
Gabi, move. I want to see Alan.

14:35.180 --> 14:36.981
No.

14:36.982 --> 14:38.249
You don't want to seem too eager.

14:38.250 --> 14:40.076
But that's my signature move.

14:41.053 --> 14:43.266
What if your new signature move

14:43.267 --> 14:44.822
is being fashionably late?

14:44.857 --> 14:46.648
Ooh, what about that? Okay, bye. Wait here!

14:48.827 --> 14:49.994
Is he here?

14:50.029 --> 14:51.796
Uh, not quite yet.

14:53.499 --> 14:55.533
Bad news, Alan. Elliot's sick.

14:55.567 --> 14:57.402
And I would hate for you to get it.

14:57.436 --> 14:59.337
Well, I don't want it.
I am very susceptible.

14:59.371 --> 15:01.149
Yeah, uh-huh. That's what I thought.

15:01.150 --> 15:03.462
So come on, let's go this
way. Go that way, go that way.

15:04.476 --> 15:06.177
Elliot Park?

15:06.211 --> 15:08.112
Alan Lowenstein?

15:08.147 --> 15:10.573
- Surprise.
- Yes.

15:10.721 --> 15:12.588
What a surprise.

15:13.452 --> 15:15.386
All right. What's happening here?

15:15.680 --> 15:17.648
It feels like when I was
the only boy in Hebrew school

15:17.649 --> 15:19.523
not invited to Jenny
Schneider's bat mitzvah.

15:19.524 --> 15:21.225
Whatever. Bitch got fat.

15:22.127 --> 15:23.795
Um...

15:23.829 --> 15:25.730
Listen, Alan, I made a horrible mistake.

15:25.764 --> 15:27.765
You're the wrong Alan.

15:27.800 --> 15:29.634
She thought you were Alan O'Shay.

15:29.668 --> 15:31.402
Alan O'Shay?

15:31.437 --> 15:32.637
Oh, I wish.

15:32.671 --> 15:35.440
Well... Hey, looks like
you both love the same Alan.

15:35.474 --> 15:38.376
Why don't you talk about him over the
magnificent dinner that I made you?

15:38.410 --> 15:41.452
So, I'm not even supposed to be here.

15:41.877 --> 15:43.506
Ah, this is so embarrassing.

15:43.556 --> 15:45.494
- I should go.
- No, don't.

15:45.660 --> 15:47.744
She's the one who screwed
this up. She should go.

15:48.854 --> 15:50.188
You stay.

15:50.222 --> 15:53.679
Otherwise I'm just gonna shame-eat
all this in the bathtub later.

15:54.827 --> 15:57.562
Elliot park in the bathtub?

15:57.783 --> 16:00.495
Oy, I need a Popsicle.

16:04.536 --> 16:05.603
(Dings)

16:05.750 --> 16:07.785
Oh, such a gentleman.

16:07.819 --> 16:10.488
You didn't have to walk me
all the way back to Josh's.

16:10.522 --> 16:12.064
But I'm glad you did.

16:12.101 --> 16:14.325
Well I wanted to tell
Elliot I could squeeze him in

16:14.359 --> 16:15.825
for surgery appointment next week.

16:15.826 --> 16:17.394
That's the only reason?

16:17.429 --> 16:19.096
No.

16:19.131 --> 16:21.899
I never knew what I had when I had it.

16:21.933 --> 16:24.268
Now that I do, I miss it.

16:24.302 --> 16:25.803
Oh.

16:25.837 --> 16:27.193
You're talking about me, right?

16:28.940 --> 16:30.674
Damn right.

16:33.912 --> 16:35.646
So?

16:36.681 --> 16:37.848
How are Alan and Elliot doing?

16:37.883 --> 16:41.107
Oh well, let's just say I'm
opening another bottle of wine.

16:41.108 --> 16:42.586
So it's going well.

16:42.621 --> 16:44.478
Oh, I have no idea. This is for me.

16:47.526 --> 16:49.326
(Both chuckle)

16:49.361 --> 16:51.095
There's the happy couple.

16:51.129 --> 16:52.212
Almost too happy.

16:53.886 --> 16:55.479
Look, there's Elliot. Why don't you go

16:55.480 --> 16:57.205
tell him the good news about your schedule.

17:01.940 --> 17:03.874
You see his face, Josh?

17:03.909 --> 17:05.943
You mean that same stupid
grin I see on yours?

17:05.977 --> 17:09.046
Oh, I got this. It's
all part of an act, baby.

17:09.079 --> 17:11.549
Next up, he's gonna
walk me to the elevator.

17:11.583 --> 17:13.804
I'm gonna give him the kiss of a lifetime.

17:13.805 --> 17:15.635
Then I'm gonna say, "Hold up, Coleman.

17:15.636 --> 17:17.588
"I have something to say to you.

17:17.622 --> 17:21.008
Payback's a bitch named Yolanda!"

17:21.593 --> 17:23.882
You'll just need to
get your bloodwork done,

17:23.883 --> 17:26.297
but you should be all set for next week.

17:26.330 --> 17:28.199
Thanks for squeezing me in.

17:28.233 --> 17:30.134
And thanks for the friends
and family discount.

17:30.942 --> 17:32.342
Wait. We didn't say anything about...

17:32.343 --> 17:34.344
Oh, bye bye!

17:36.174 --> 17:38.578
- What?
- I don't want to say anything.

17:40.011 --> 17:41.845
But I will.

17:41.880 --> 17:44.174
I can't believe you're
getting plastic surgery.

17:44.175 --> 17:45.683
Why do you want to mess with perfection?

17:45.717 --> 17:48.023
It's like those people who
make the gluten-free bagels.

17:48.499 --> 17:49.486
What?

17:49.521 --> 17:52.123
Your face is so handsome and youthful.

17:52.124 --> 17:55.226
Those thick luscious eyebrows.

17:55.260 --> 17:57.973
They're like two magnificent caterpillars

17:57.974 --> 18:00.788
who said, "To hell with
becoming butterflies."

18:01.099 --> 18:02.780
If I didn't know we were the same age,

18:03.036 --> 18:04.935
I'd swear you weren't a day over 32.

18:06.204 --> 18:07.972
You know,

18:08.006 --> 18:09.940
Gabi inviting you here tonight

18:09.975 --> 18:11.909
might have been the best
mistake she's ever made.

18:13.845 --> 18:15.713
To mistakes.

18:18.436 --> 18:20.403
(Both chuckle)

18:20.719 --> 18:21.785
Yolanda...

18:21.820 --> 18:23.721
Today was amazing.

18:23.755 --> 18:25.623
Just like old times.

18:25.657 --> 18:27.904
Better. You paid.

18:32.597 --> 18:34.711
You know, if I don't push that button,

18:34.712 --> 18:36.267
I will never leave.

18:36.301 --> 18:38.302
So push it.

18:43.241 --> 18:45.075
Hold it.

18:45.110 --> 18:47.333
Coleman, I have something to say to you.

18:47.646 --> 18:48.946
What's that?

18:49.810 --> 18:51.878
Are you free Friday night?

18:55.913 --> 18:57.914
I know this day was a disaster,

18:57.948 --> 19:00.129
but everybody deserves
a cake on their birthday.

19:00.529 --> 19:02.197
It's a tiered strawberry shortcake

19:02.198 --> 19:04.407
with Tahitian-vanilla whipped
cream and fresh berries.

19:04.408 --> 19:07.419
Ooh, he is gonna love
throwing that in your face.

19:08.792 --> 19:10.493
I'll hold off on lighting the candles.

19:14.665 --> 19:16.365
So?

19:17.534 --> 19:19.135
Did you get your revenge?

19:20.337 --> 19:22.543
Oh, I made out like a bandit.

19:27.311 --> 19:29.624
Elliot, unlike your life,

19:29.643 --> 19:31.461
your cake is one thing I'd never screw up.

19:32.916 --> 19:34.917
- Sing...
- Hold on.

19:34.952 --> 19:36.462
I'd like to say something first.

19:36.493 --> 19:37.887
Uh-oh.

19:37.921 --> 19:40.623
- This birthday has sucked.
- That was me. I did that.

19:41.602 --> 19:44.452
But there's been one bright spot and
that's been reconnecting with Alan.

19:44.540 --> 19:46.829
That was me. I did that.

19:47.831 --> 19:51.567
This sweet, funny, adorable man

19:51.602 --> 19:54.637
made me realize I don't
need plastic surgery.

19:55.578 --> 19:58.228
I think 40 could be my best year yet.

19:58.334 --> 20:00.009
Both: Aww.

20:00.043 --> 20:02.070
Wait. How can you be 40 if I'm 42?

20:02.071 --> 20:03.579
Shh!

20:05.000 --> 20:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

20:14.176 --> 20:15.376
How's it going?

20:15.410 --> 20:18.045
He says it's going to be
one of the best ones yet.

20:18.046 --> 20:21.597
The tech guy who still writes out
his ideas on butcher block paper.

dong a "gay desk for success".
