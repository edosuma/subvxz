WEBVTT

00:19.586 --> 00:22.655
- Oh, Gail.
- Hey, Larry.

00:22.722 --> 00:24.424
I was just doing
my woodworking.

00:24.524 --> 00:26.359
- Needed a break.
- Uh-huh.

00:26.426 --> 00:29.729
I'm building a birdhouse
for the tweeties on my balcony.

00:29.829 --> 00:31.398
- You want a peek?
- I'm in a rush.

00:31.498 --> 00:34.267
Yeah. Yeah, I'm going
for a walk anyway.

00:34.367 --> 00:36.069
Enjoy it.

00:36.169 --> 00:38.438
Hey, you wanna see one of
the coolest spots in Philly?

00:38.538 --> 00:40.440
'It's just three blocks
from here. I discovered it.'

00:40.540 --> 00:41.941
I've got a lot
of reading to do.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.444
And Bruce is coming over.
Goodnight, Larry.

00:52.552 --> 00:56.289
How's the Miller's Tale
gonna help me in life?

00:56.389 --> 00:58.591
[sighs]
Totally unreadable.

00:58.691 --> 01:01.795
So drop the class.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.063
I'm going
to med school anyway.

01:07.734 --> 01:09.102
Hey.

01:09.202 --> 01:10.904
What?

01:10.970 --> 01:12.072
I'm done studying.

01:12.138 --> 01:13.373
I'm not.

01:13.440 --> 01:14.707
Yeah, you are.

01:14.774 --> 01:16.476
Bruce, I have a seminar
in the morning.

01:16.576 --> 01:19.045
It's only summer school.

01:19.112 --> 01:20.480
Skip it.

01:20.580 --> 01:23.583
What am I gonna have to do,
kick you out of here?

01:23.650 --> 01:26.553
I'm getting sick
of that story, too.

02:04.491 --> 02:07.026
Came in this morning,
addressed to homicide.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.862
I think it's one of yours.

02:10.597 --> 02:12.465
Number one. Kitchen floor.

02:12.532 --> 02:15.435
She had a useless cat
who did nothing.

02:15.502 --> 02:17.170
'Number two. Brunette.'

02:17.270 --> 02:19.639
At least two useless cats.

02:19.706 --> 02:21.107
Ellen Curtis had two cats.

02:21.174 --> 02:23.042
Three. This one died on me.

02:23.143 --> 02:26.012
And her useless cat
just watched?

02:26.112 --> 02:27.680
Oh, this bastard.

02:27.780 --> 02:30.683
"I don't like what I do,
but I can't go yet.

02:30.783 --> 02:33.720
The days are still warm."

02:33.820 --> 02:35.221
That's him.

02:35.321 --> 02:36.656
Try to get prints off this?

02:36.723 --> 02:39.726
Uh, This guy doesn't
leave prints.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.561
Where has he been
for five years?

02:41.661 --> 02:42.729
And why is he
sending us this letter?

02:42.829 --> 02:43.730
He's bragging.

02:43.830 --> 02:46.132
He's telling us he's back.

02:46.199 --> 02:48.234
And that he's gonna do it again.

03:23.269 --> 03:26.039
Gail Chimayo.
Summer '98.

03:26.105 --> 03:27.674
Guy broke in
through the window

03:27.740 --> 03:31.110
raped her like all the others,
but Gail...he killed.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.445
He got through those bars?

03:32.545 --> 03:34.113
'Guy was some kind of spider.'

03:34.214 --> 03:36.683
He'd climb walls,
get in tiny windows.

03:36.749 --> 03:39.719
- So he's skinny.
- He's a contortionist.

03:39.786 --> 03:42.088
Boss, I don't have
the constitution

03:42.188 --> 03:44.257
to go after him again.

03:44.357 --> 03:46.459
Why'd he kill Gail
and not the others?

03:46.559 --> 03:48.528
- She fought back.
- Any physical evidence?

03:48.595 --> 03:51.297
Just the DNA from his sperm,
but we never found a match.

03:51.397 --> 03:52.632
I got samples from everybody.

03:52.732 --> 03:55.268
The neighbors, plumbers,
handymen. Nothing.

03:55.368 --> 03:57.804
It was like chasing a ghost.
Boss, I can't do this.

03:57.904 --> 03:59.272
I'm not asking you to, Nick.

03:59.372 --> 04:00.707
This case became
a health issue for me.

04:00.773 --> 04:03.042
Didn't you get
any direction where to look?

04:03.109 --> 04:04.644
He only struck
when the weather was warm.

04:04.744 --> 04:06.779
So, I check out baseball teams

04:06.879 --> 04:08.548
exchange students coming
in for the summer.

04:08.615 --> 04:09.949
- Circus.
- Yeah?

04:10.049 --> 04:12.252
Yeah, yeah, I interviewed
a damn clown.

04:13.319 --> 04:15.788
Who was the top suspect?

04:15.888 --> 04:16.990
Bruce Elridge.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.925
- 'Gail's boyfriend.'
- How come?

04:18.992 --> 04:20.760
He gave a shady,
hostile interview.

04:20.827 --> 04:22.262
'Refused to give his DNA.'

04:22.328 --> 04:24.797
Had not one good alibi
for any of the rapes.

04:24.897 --> 04:28.401
Unfortunately, Vera's under
orders not to talk to him.

04:28.468 --> 04:29.836
Yeah, that's not official.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.104
The DA's office
was very clear, Nick.

04:31.170 --> 04:32.905
Do not approach him again.

04:32.972 --> 04:34.841
What did you do to him?

04:34.941 --> 04:37.577
I was runnin' the case.
He was a serious suspect.

04:37.644 --> 04:39.345
He put him in the room
four times.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.014
What am I supposed to do,
start all over again?

04:41.114 --> 04:43.816
- I'll start it over.
- Whoa, this is my job.

04:43.916 --> 04:45.318
I'm not gonna get
cut out of it.

04:45.418 --> 04:46.519
Well, which one is it, Vera?

04:46.619 --> 04:47.987
- You in or out?
- I don't know.

04:48.087 --> 04:50.290
Alright.
Lil will read the case again.

04:50.356 --> 04:51.858
'You wanna join her, okay.'

04:51.958 --> 04:53.760
But I don't want you going to
Bruce without new direction.

04:53.826 --> 04:55.028
We got the letter.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.429
Connect him
to the letter, Nick

04:56.496 --> 04:57.497
you can go back.

04:57.597 --> 04:58.831
Not before.

05:05.705 --> 05:08.041
You got an angle
how to do that?

05:08.141 --> 05:10.143
Yeah, I got an angle.

05:18.785 --> 05:21.287
- No. Not you again.
- Got some questions, Larry.

05:21.354 --> 05:23.556
Forget it.

05:23.656 --> 05:25.058
You browbeat
this guy, too?

05:25.158 --> 05:27.794
He's a material witness.
I talk to him sometimes.

05:29.829 --> 05:30.797
Okay.

05:34.133 --> 05:38.338
Larry, um, it's Lilly Rush.
With homicide.

05:38.404 --> 05:40.573
I need to talk to you
about Gail.

05:47.246 --> 05:49.415
I'll talk to you.
Not him.

05:49.515 --> 05:50.817
Grow up.

05:50.883 --> 05:52.251
Open the door, Larry.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.554
Detective Vera will
take a little walk.

06:03.996 --> 06:06.432
Oh, this guy's sick, huh?

06:06.532 --> 06:10.336
Anything about it say
Bruce Elridge to you?

06:10.403 --> 06:13.840
Ah, the smugness fits.

06:13.906 --> 06:14.941
He was such a snob.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.343
He'd never even
say hello.

06:17.410 --> 06:20.380
- So you didn't know him well.
- Nah.

06:20.446 --> 06:23.516
You told 911 that you thought
Gail and her boyfriend

06:23.583 --> 06:25.852
were having a fight next door.

06:25.918 --> 06:27.086
If I may speak.

06:27.186 --> 06:28.388
I never saw anyone else

06:28.454 --> 06:30.289
go inside that apartment.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.792
What was your
relationship with Gail?

06:32.892 --> 06:36.195
Well, we were good neighbors.

06:36.262 --> 06:37.296
Good friends.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.432
Maybe something
could have blossomed

06:39.532 --> 06:41.768
if the world was
laid out differently.

06:41.868 --> 06:43.102
So now you're flirting?

06:43.202 --> 06:44.604
'You didn't say that
five years ago.'

06:44.704 --> 06:46.038
You asked about
the 911 call.

06:46.105 --> 06:47.540
'Not my relationship
with Gail.'

06:47.607 --> 06:50.810
Did the noise from
next door wake you, Larry?

06:50.910 --> 06:54.480
I was up, working.

07:17.336 --> 07:18.304
Gail?

07:22.175 --> 07:24.577
What's going on in there?

07:24.644 --> 07:27.079
It sounds like
more than reading.

07:34.754 --> 07:38.090
- '911.'
- I'm at 1832 Sansom.

07:38.157 --> 07:40.293
I'm worried about my neighbor.

07:43.796 --> 07:47.366
That was heroic,
making that call, Larry.

07:49.535 --> 07:51.504
It was instinct.

07:51.604 --> 07:57.877
Anyway, uh, the cops came,
knocked, left.

07:57.977 --> 07:59.378
She was found dead
the next day.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.713
Cops can't break down a door

08:00.813 --> 08:02.782
just because some guy
senses something.

08:02.849 --> 08:04.851
I gave a DNA sample
right off.

08:04.951 --> 08:06.219
I'll give another one
if you like.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.787
That's not necessary.

08:07.854 --> 08:09.889
So back to Bruce.
You seen him lately?

08:09.989 --> 08:11.724
I did run into him
a couple of months ago

08:11.824 --> 08:13.125
up at the temple campus.

08:13.192 --> 08:14.560
He does experiments
at med school?

08:14.660 --> 08:16.696
Yeah, he was
full of hot air

08:16.796 --> 08:20.466
about some kind of sleep
study he's doing on cats.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.239
- Thank you.
- Oh, yeah.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.641
Someday maybe we should
check that out.

08:35.248 --> 08:37.416
How'd you find out
about his research?

08:37.517 --> 08:39.252
I track this guy,
I knew it was animals

08:39.352 --> 08:40.920
but I always figured
it was lab rats.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.421
That's him.

08:50.396 --> 08:51.664
You can't talk to me.

08:51.731 --> 08:53.266
That letter you wrote
gave me new cause.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.568
Your pal here made my life
miserable five years ago.

08:55.668 --> 08:57.537
And you could have ended it at
anytime by giving a DNA sample.

08:57.603 --> 08:59.772
Let's not have that
conversation again.

08:59.872 --> 09:03.276
Bruce, I'm the one
who wanted to talk to you.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.511
- And who are you?
- Detective Rush.

09:05.578 --> 09:07.947
I'm looking back
into Gail's murder.

09:08.047 --> 09:10.283
Uh-huh.

09:10.383 --> 09:13.052
I was wondering about
the animal research you do.

09:13.119 --> 09:14.854
What about it?

09:14.921 --> 09:16.255
We're talking cats, right?

09:16.355 --> 09:17.223
Yeah.

09:17.290 --> 09:18.391
And I don't feel
guilty about it

09:18.457 --> 09:19.792
if that's your
next question.

09:19.892 --> 09:21.594
- Do you kill those cats?
- If need be.

09:21.694 --> 09:23.629
If a person's got cancer, I'm
not gonna worry about testing

09:23.729 --> 09:25.865
on some useless animal.

09:25.932 --> 09:27.600
Why are they useless?

09:27.700 --> 09:29.869
They're sub-human.

09:29.936 --> 09:31.270
Small brains.

09:31.370 --> 09:33.940
- Like women?
- Women have a use.

09:34.040 --> 09:37.143
Bruce, why not make this easy?
Volunteer your DNA.

09:37.243 --> 09:38.911
Fourth amendment says
I got a right to privacy.

09:38.978 --> 09:40.580
Don't you want to be
ruled out as a suspect?

09:40.646 --> 09:42.548
On the contrary.

09:42.615 --> 09:44.250
I don't want
desperate detectives

09:44.317 --> 09:47.053
to act like it's a discovery
if they match my DNA to semen

09:47.119 --> 09:49.555
that was on Gail's sheets.
I was her boyfriend.

09:49.622 --> 09:52.825
We were very active,
if you get me.

09:52.925 --> 09:56.462
I'm sure my DNA's
all over that place.

09:56.562 --> 09:58.331
- I see.
- I don't need a witch hunt.

09:58.431 --> 10:01.067
Just 'cause you couldn't
solve this thing.

10:04.236 --> 10:05.171
'Vera.'

10:08.507 --> 10:09.842
What is it about this job?

10:09.942 --> 10:11.644
You yap on all the time
about the other cases.

10:11.744 --> 10:13.446
Why not this one?

10:13.512 --> 10:15.247
This one did
things to me.

10:15.314 --> 10:16.649
Like what?

10:16.749 --> 10:19.852
You ever work a job
makes you feel helpless?

10:19.952 --> 10:22.321
Yeah, I can always
find motive, direction

10:22.421 --> 10:25.091
'but that piece
of crap, he stops.'

10:25.157 --> 10:26.692
Leaves me with nothing.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.861
I start second guessing
everything, you know?

10:28.961 --> 10:32.431
Maybe I'm not
the bad ass I think I am.

10:33.799 --> 10:34.800
I want this guy.

10:34.867 --> 10:36.535
- So do I.
- We can get him.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.137
But I need you, Vera.

10:38.204 --> 10:40.840
You know him
better than anyone.

10:50.316 --> 10:53.185
If he's following his MO

10:53.285 --> 10:55.354
he's already hunting.

10:55.454 --> 10:57.823
Stalking someone right now,
following her home.

10:59.959 --> 11:02.862
Let's hope she's
got her windows locked.

11:08.834 --> 11:11.737
I should have noticed
that they all had cats.

11:11.837 --> 11:13.739
It didn't mean anything.

11:13.839 --> 11:15.074
Till we got the letter.

11:15.174 --> 11:16.575
(Jeffries)
'It's a list of parolees'

11:16.676 --> 11:18.177
who were locked up
the last five years

11:18.244 --> 11:19.879
and just got out.

11:19.979 --> 11:24.183
One guy fits the time line,
but he weighs 300 pounds.

11:24.250 --> 11:25.251
Since when?

11:25.351 --> 11:27.386
His whole life.
It ain't him.

11:28.387 --> 11:29.922
It was worth a try.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.159
Well, how'd you do today?

11:33.225 --> 11:36.595
Found out Bruce Elridge
tortures cats for a living.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.164
- Does he?
- Mm-hmm.

11:38.230 --> 11:41.600
Talks about useless animals,
and won't give up his DNA.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.335
I gotta go sit on him.

11:43.402 --> 11:44.603
Make sure he doesn't
climb through

11:44.704 --> 11:46.605
anybody's window tonight.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.275
I got new addresses
on the first two victims.

11:49.375 --> 11:50.876
They've both moved.

11:50.943 --> 11:53.379
- Let's go.
- Oh, wait till tomorrow.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.514
I don't want you going
to these girls at midnight

11:55.581 --> 11:58.250
asking about their rape.

11:58.350 --> 11:59.952
Yeah.

12:00.052 --> 12:01.287
Tomorrow.

12:02.621 --> 12:04.123
Goodnight.

12:25.911 --> 12:28.748
My dad told me
why you're here.

12:28.814 --> 12:29.915
Can I come in?

12:29.982 --> 12:33.486
No, I'd rather,
I'd rather talk out here.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.154
We think he's back,
Ellen.

12:37.790 --> 12:39.458
Oh, no.

12:39.558 --> 12:42.061
Can I show you
a picture?

12:45.664 --> 12:47.733
A detective showed me
that five years ago.

12:47.800 --> 12:51.170
I know.
Just look again.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.773
Could this be the guy
who attacked you?

12:53.839 --> 12:55.274
I couldn't say.

12:55.341 --> 12:56.842
I never saw him.

12:58.811 --> 13:00.846
Did his voice sound
like anyone you knew?

13:00.946 --> 13:03.015
I told the first
detective no.

13:03.115 --> 13:05.151
I don't think so.

13:05.251 --> 13:06.519
You said at the time

13:06.619 --> 13:08.587
you were certain
it was a stranger.

13:08.654 --> 13:11.023
Right.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.526
You got a different
feeling about that now?

13:16.095 --> 13:18.531
It's okay if you do.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.601
No.

13:24.603 --> 13:27.873
No, I don't know him.

13:27.973 --> 13:31.143
I really can't, I really
can't tell you anything.

13:31.210 --> 13:35.114
The lead detective
on this case is female, Ellen.

13:35.181 --> 13:37.383
Would you be more
comfortable talking to her?

13:39.051 --> 13:40.719
Maybe.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.154
Okay.

13:42.221 --> 13:44.890
I gotta go to work,
but, um..

13:44.990 --> 13:47.293
I'm home every day
by six.

13:47.359 --> 13:48.327
Alright.

14:31.103 --> 14:32.738
Could be him.

14:32.838 --> 14:34.607
Could be yo yo ma.

14:34.707 --> 14:35.841
I didn't see crap.

14:35.908 --> 14:38.611
He covered your eyes
right away.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.212
I'm in my kitchen.

14:40.279 --> 14:42.748
All of a sudden there's
a towel over my face.

14:42.848 --> 14:46.118
Guy whispers that
he's real sorry.

14:46.218 --> 14:48.354
Rapes me right there.

14:48.420 --> 14:52.091
And then stays for an hour,
talking to me.

14:54.460 --> 14:56.962
(male #1)
'Always nervous
on first dates.'

14:57.062 --> 14:59.632
'But we did okay,
didn't we?'

14:59.732 --> 15:02.635
You were playing
such a sad song before.

15:02.735 --> 15:05.604
You wanna play it for me?

15:05.704 --> 15:06.639
I don't think so.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.040
(male #1)
'That's okay.'

15:13.913 --> 15:15.080
'Those bars
on your windows'

15:15.147 --> 15:16.982
'are no good, honey.'

15:17.082 --> 15:19.318
'They're too far apart.'

15:19.418 --> 15:20.886
'You gotta be
more careful.'

15:26.091 --> 15:30.396
You know what he said to me
right before he left?

15:30.462 --> 15:35.768
"Wish that we had met under
different circumstances."

15:35.834 --> 15:37.603
I'm sorry, Niki.

15:37.670 --> 15:40.005
I just hope you
finally get the guy.

15:44.977 --> 15:47.846
I don't want to make you
uncomfortable, but, um..

15:47.947 --> 15:51.984
you were obviously
in close contact with him.

15:52.084 --> 15:53.852
Yeah.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.822
He touched you.
You must have touched him.

15:56.922 --> 16:00.192
Was there anything that you
felt that was distinctive?

16:00.292 --> 16:03.495
Um, scars? Moles?

16:05.664 --> 16:09.601
- This is kind of weird.
- That's okay.

16:09.668 --> 16:12.771
I did touch him. I-I didn't
do it to be intimate.

16:12.838 --> 16:14.673
Of course not.

16:14.773 --> 16:17.343
I was trying
to get him off me.

16:19.845 --> 16:21.714
And you noticed something.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.952
Smooth skin.

16:27.019 --> 16:30.889
Legs, arms,
everything.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.325
Soft and smooth
like a woman's.

16:39.732 --> 16:41.567
Excuse me a second.

16:44.636 --> 16:46.238
What's that?

16:46.338 --> 16:49.308
- Bruce Elridge's coffee cup.
- You stole his coffee?

16:49.375 --> 16:51.377
He abandoned it
in a public place.

16:51.477 --> 16:52.811
Now we got his precious DNA.

16:58.083 --> 17:00.419
According to Niki Lamas
we're looking at a guy

17:00.519 --> 17:02.554
with super smooth skin.

17:02.654 --> 17:03.756
Well, that's new.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.759
Maybe he shaves his body
before he attacks.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.560
No hair ever found
at the scenes.

17:08.660 --> 17:09.928
Anything from Ellen Curtis?

17:10.029 --> 17:11.497
Jeffries got the sense
she knew something.

17:11.563 --> 17:12.698
I'll go back to her today.

17:12.765 --> 17:16.068
Hmm. And how's
our boy Vera doing?

17:16.168 --> 17:19.605
He's...passionate.

17:19.705 --> 17:22.274
That passion almost compromised
this case five years ago.

17:22.374 --> 17:23.776
I'm watching, boss.

17:27.379 --> 17:29.181
I hate to rat a guy out

17:29.248 --> 17:32.017
but Vera just walked in
with Bruce Elridge.

17:32.084 --> 17:33.685
- I can't have this.
- Let me go.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.522
You'll want to look
at this first.

17:40.392 --> 17:41.527
This isn't gonna help.

17:45.798 --> 17:47.399
(Elridge)
'You can't keep me here.'

17:47.466 --> 17:49.701
I can keep you here
for six hours.

17:51.036 --> 17:52.871
So what's with
the animal experiments?

17:54.239 --> 17:56.809
What are you,
an activist?

17:56.909 --> 17:59.378
Lot of killers start off
torturing animals..

17:59.445 --> 18:01.246
...but a smart guy like you

18:01.313 --> 18:02.481
know something about that.

18:02.581 --> 18:03.916
So what?

18:03.982 --> 18:07.219
Is that you, Bruce, hmm?

18:07.286 --> 18:10.889
Did you go from cats to women
with your viciousness?

18:10.956 --> 18:12.224
That's, that's a leap.

18:12.291 --> 18:13.659
You slip into their apartments

18:13.759 --> 18:15.494
with that wimp-boy
frame of yours.

18:15.594 --> 18:17.663
You terrorize them and you
pretend you're on a date?

18:17.763 --> 18:19.398
I got a girlfriend.

18:19.465 --> 18:20.933
We're very very happy.

18:20.999 --> 18:22.601
Maybe you didn't
mean to kill Gail.

18:22.668 --> 18:24.670
- Just rape her like the others.
- I didn't do anything to her.

18:24.770 --> 18:27.239
So why don't you stop
acting like a thug.

18:27.306 --> 18:28.941
What'd you just call me,
you little rube?

18:29.007 --> 18:31.176
Say it again, come on!
Say it again.

18:31.276 --> 18:33.078
- Say it again!
- Vera!

18:33.145 --> 18:35.247
Looks like, uh, Bruce here
thinks I'm wasting his time.

18:35.314 --> 18:36.515
Come out here.

18:36.615 --> 18:38.250
- Bruce has better things to--
- Vera!

18:41.120 --> 18:42.621
We got the DNA back.

18:45.457 --> 18:46.925
It's a negative match.

18:48.994 --> 18:50.996
You bunch of thugs!

18:57.469 --> 19:00.672
Bruce, what the hell's
wrong with you?

19:00.772 --> 19:01.840
What's that
supposed to mean?

19:01.940 --> 19:03.041
You knew we wouldn't
match your DNA.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.042
So?

19:04.143 --> 19:05.711
So why not give a sample
five years ago

19:05.811 --> 19:06.812
like a normal person?

19:06.879 --> 19:08.147
I got a right to privacy.

19:08.213 --> 19:10.482
How's giving a swab of spit
invading your privacy?

19:10.549 --> 19:13.185
A guy's got a right to have sex
with his own girlfriend.

19:15.387 --> 19:16.855
Okay.

19:16.955 --> 19:18.457
Okay.

19:18.524 --> 19:21.793
You weren't
having sex with her.

19:21.860 --> 19:22.995
Excuse me?

19:23.061 --> 19:25.364
You didn't want us
to not find your DNA.

19:25.464 --> 19:26.965
It wasn't anywhere
in that apartment

19:27.032 --> 19:30.636
'cause she was
shutting you down.

19:30.702 --> 19:32.738
We went out
for seven months.

19:32.838 --> 19:36.808
And by that time
a guy's got a right.

19:36.875 --> 19:39.244
You think I wanted all those
macho cops, all my friends

19:39.344 --> 19:40.746
knowing I was putting up
with such a prude?

19:40.846 --> 19:43.882
Hey, Bruce,
this ain't high school.

19:43.982 --> 19:45.417
This case died five years ago

19:45.517 --> 19:47.152
and you could have
helped us bring it in.

19:47.219 --> 19:48.554
And you coming
off to your pals

19:48.654 --> 19:49.721
like some big stud

19:49.821 --> 19:52.357
isn't more important
than a girl dying.

19:58.997 --> 20:00.933
'My partner got
the sense you knew'

20:01.033 --> 20:02.834
we were
on the wrong trail.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.737
How would I know that?

20:07.039 --> 20:08.874
Maybe you saw the guy.

20:08.941 --> 20:09.908
No.

20:11.777 --> 20:14.112
Maybe..

20:14.213 --> 20:15.747
...you knew the guy?

20:18.617 --> 20:20.285
I really try not
to think about this.

20:20.385 --> 20:22.054
That's understandable.

20:22.120 --> 20:24.056
But he contacted us.

20:24.122 --> 20:26.458
Let us know
he's gonna do it again.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.460
I can't worry about that.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.095
- If you could describe him--
- I can't.

20:30.195 --> 20:31.396
I know that's what
you've been saying

20:31.463 --> 20:32.931
for all these years, but maybe

20:33.031 --> 20:35.467
it's because it's too painful.

20:37.703 --> 20:41.940
Ellen...I'm just scared
it's gonna happen again.

20:48.046 --> 20:51.049
I never used
to be scared of anything.

20:51.116 --> 20:52.117
No?

20:52.217 --> 20:53.919
Now I live
with my parents.

20:55.587 --> 21:00.158
I'm terrified if
I'm not home before dark.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.927
You had a life before.

21:03.729 --> 21:05.264
Just want it back.

21:05.330 --> 21:07.099
I don't think
that's in the cards.

21:07.165 --> 21:08.433
I do.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.068
But you have to start
by telling me

21:10.135 --> 21:11.803
what you saw that night.

21:14.172 --> 21:16.174
It might not be relevant.

21:19.311 --> 21:23.315
I was at the Free Library,
outside buying a coffee

21:23.415 --> 21:29.521
and this, um...this guy started
talking to me about books.

21:29.621 --> 21:31.823
'And I can't even
remember what else.'

21:31.923 --> 21:35.193
But it was only for,
like, a few minutes.

21:35.294 --> 21:38.130
And then I went home.

21:38.196 --> 21:40.999
That was it.

21:41.099 --> 21:42.634
Did you get his name?

21:45.470 --> 21:48.473
And the rape
happened that night.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.151
Olive?

21:59.217 --> 22:00.686
Edie?

22:02.321 --> 22:05.023
Hey, kitty, kitty, kitty. Meow.

22:05.123 --> 22:06.892
You scared me.

22:12.998 --> 22:14.232
(man)
I'm so sorry.

22:15.367 --> 22:17.336
First dates are hard.

22:17.402 --> 22:20.639
Especially with
serious girls like you.

22:20.706 --> 22:24.042
I just wish we could have met
under different circumstances.

22:27.045 --> 22:28.480
It was so quick.

22:28.547 --> 22:30.749
It was like a flashbulb.

22:30.849 --> 22:34.086
And I, uh...
I could be wrong, but..

22:34.186 --> 22:37.923
...the face I keep seeing..

22:38.023 --> 22:41.026
...is the guy
from the library.

22:45.764 --> 22:49.034
Um, dark hair.

22:50.569 --> 22:52.270
Kinda shaggy.

22:54.740 --> 22:56.174
Smooth skin.

22:58.343 --> 23:01.113
This is gonna
help us a lot.

23:01.213 --> 23:02.914
I'm sorry I didn't
do it earlier.

23:03.014 --> 23:05.016
You weren't ready earlier.

23:06.752 --> 23:10.689
I should have
told that first detective.

23:10.756 --> 23:12.858
I was worried he'd think..

23:12.924 --> 23:15.727
...that since
I'd talked to the guy..

23:17.028 --> 23:19.631
...I'd led him on.

23:19.731 --> 23:21.032
You know..

23:21.099 --> 23:26.271
Detective Vera only
looks like a Neanderthal.

23:30.909 --> 23:32.577
Excuse me.

23:36.214 --> 23:37.983
What?

23:38.083 --> 23:40.652
Sex Crimes got an assault,
Ninth and Lombard.

23:41.720 --> 23:43.121
Same MO?

23:44.656 --> 23:46.458
Crawled through
the second floor window.

23:50.095 --> 23:52.130
Our boy is back.

24:13.852 --> 24:16.955
(Jeffries)
'Must have shimmied up
that drain pipe'

24:17.022 --> 24:18.290
'climbed across the wall'

24:18.356 --> 24:20.525
'slipped in through the bars.'

24:20.625 --> 24:22.260
Now, that's determination.

24:22.327 --> 24:24.663
- Are there prints on the bars?
- Of course not.

24:24.763 --> 24:27.299
Ah, but he did leave
a token behind.

24:27.365 --> 24:28.533
Kenfield filter.

24:28.633 --> 24:30.769
Left it right
at the bedside.

24:33.638 --> 24:35.173
This the victim?

24:35.273 --> 24:37.876
Yeah. Sex Crimes
took her to the hospital.

24:37.976 --> 24:40.378
'They know you want
talk to her, though.'

24:40.479 --> 24:43.682
- We doing this together?
- Yeah.

24:46.985 --> 24:48.353
Please.

25:02.133 --> 25:06.004
Maybe I should have fought
or something.

25:06.071 --> 25:08.340
There's no should,
Tanya.

25:08.406 --> 25:10.075
Does, uh..

25:10.175 --> 25:12.177
...this look like him?

25:12.244 --> 25:14.746
He covered my eyes so quickly.

25:14.846 --> 25:16.481
- Did he speak to you?
- Yeah.

25:16.548 --> 25:18.250
Afterwards,
he talked a lot.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.886
He talked about
art and books.

25:22.354 --> 25:25.190
I'm in grad school
for art history, but I don't..

25:25.257 --> 25:27.325
I don't know how
he knew that.

25:27.392 --> 25:28.894
Did you recognize his voice?

25:28.994 --> 25:31.496
No. He was a stranger.

25:33.398 --> 25:36.902
- You study art history?
- Yeah.

25:37.002 --> 25:38.937
Been to any museums lately?

25:39.037 --> 25:43.608
Um, I was at the Rodin
a few days ago.

25:45.710 --> 25:48.346
Did you notice
anything about his skin?

25:48.413 --> 25:50.615
It was...smooth.

25:50.715 --> 25:55.220
You know,
like...hairless.

25:55.287 --> 25:56.788
No hair at all?

25:56.888 --> 25:59.224
Didn't seem like it.

26:01.426 --> 26:03.728
Do you know what he told me
before he left?

26:05.530 --> 26:07.399
That he wished
that we had met under--

26:07.465 --> 26:10.735
Under different circumstances.

26:10.802 --> 26:12.871
And that he was sorry.

26:20.078 --> 26:23.481
(Rush)
Does this guy stalk girls
on Ben Franklin Parkway?

26:23.582 --> 26:25.116
Gail worked at
the Museum of Art.

26:25.216 --> 26:27.619
Ellen was at the Free Library
the day she was attacked

26:27.719 --> 26:31.489
and Tanya went
to the Rodin last week.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.158
Niki was on Locust.

26:33.258 --> 26:34.626
Leaving the Academy of Music.

26:35.827 --> 26:38.229
Maybe he targets smart girls.

26:39.631 --> 26:41.633
All the victims
were college types.

26:41.733 --> 26:44.336
Serious girls.
He said it to Ellen.

26:44.436 --> 26:46.838
Let's post this composite
all over the Parkway.

26:46.938 --> 26:49.174
I got it.

26:49.274 --> 26:51.242
I interviewed a woman
who worked with Gail

26:51.309 --> 26:53.511
at the art museum.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.480
Anna.

26:55.580 --> 26:58.149
Anna Berlin.

26:58.249 --> 27:01.353
They had lunch together
the day of the murder.

27:01.453 --> 27:03.288
We have this now.

27:03.355 --> 27:05.757
Let's see if she knows
our new friend.

27:10.695 --> 27:12.931
(Berlin)
Is this who killed Gail?

27:12.998 --> 27:13.999
Could be.

27:14.099 --> 27:15.700
Do you recognize him at all?

27:15.800 --> 27:17.802
I don't think so.

27:17.869 --> 27:20.805
Take your time.

27:20.872 --> 27:23.875
I can't be sure, but..

27:23.975 --> 27:25.110
But what?

27:26.978 --> 27:28.146
It sort of looks like a guy

27:28.213 --> 27:29.848
we'd see out here
at lunch time.

27:31.216 --> 27:32.484
You and Gail saw him?

27:32.550 --> 27:35.820
He'd hang out here,
smoking, watching people.

27:35.887 --> 27:37.222
I kind of forgot about him.

27:37.322 --> 27:39.658
He hasn't been around
for years.

27:39.724 --> 27:41.826
But he's been back lately.

27:43.395 --> 27:45.063
- Ever get a name?
- No.

27:45.163 --> 27:47.565
We only talked to him once.

27:51.002 --> 27:53.071
How's the pre-med student?

27:53.171 --> 27:55.240
Arrogant. Pushy.

27:55.340 --> 27:56.875
In other words, the same.

27:56.975 --> 27:59.377
I know, I have bad taste in men.

27:59.477 --> 28:00.679
(man)
You ladies work here?

28:00.745 --> 28:01.846
Yeah.

28:01.913 --> 28:03.181
How's the new exhibit?

28:03.248 --> 28:06.084
The Monet? It's beautiful.
I recommend it.

28:06.184 --> 28:07.719
Maybe I'll take a look.

28:09.888 --> 28:11.589
See you in there.

28:19.197 --> 28:21.666
I didn't think to mention it
to you back then.

28:21.733 --> 28:24.602
People are always
asking questions.

28:24.703 --> 28:27.072
Do you think he may have
been watching Gail?

28:28.039 --> 28:30.075
He wasn't there for the art.

28:35.747 --> 28:37.248
Got something.

28:37.348 --> 28:38.750
Girl was with
a friend and her mom

28:38.850 --> 28:39.951
on Ben Franklin Parkway.

28:40.051 --> 28:41.286
Saw your composite.

28:42.887 --> 28:45.957
This is Lilly.
She's a police officer, too.

28:46.057 --> 28:48.426
Tell her
what you told me.

28:48.526 --> 28:50.628
That's Carl.

28:50.729 --> 28:53.264
My mommy's boyfriend.

29:00.271 --> 29:01.773
What do you got?

29:01.873 --> 29:04.042
Carl Heeley, grew up in
a trailer park in Trenton.

29:04.109 --> 29:05.243
Moved to Philly at 18

29:05.310 --> 29:06.578
worked as a security guard

29:06.644 --> 29:08.480
in the Franklin Institute
from '92 to '98.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.482
- Across from the Free Library.
- Yeah.

29:10.582 --> 29:11.816
And the last five years

29:11.916 --> 29:13.718
he was at an army base
in Portland.

29:13.785 --> 29:15.987
- Just got back to town.
- How'd he behave in Oregon?

29:16.087 --> 29:18.156
Dishonorably discharged
six weeks ago

29:18.256 --> 29:19.891
breaking into
a female officer's room.

29:19.958 --> 29:21.392
Through the window.

29:21.459 --> 29:23.895
She was trained in combat
though, unlike our girls.

29:23.962 --> 29:26.097
She fought him, ID'd him,
and they sent him packing.

29:26.164 --> 29:27.632
Military will have
the blood type.

29:27.732 --> 29:30.068
(Rush)
'We're getting
a subpoena right now.'

29:30.135 --> 29:31.903
Pick up this soldier.

29:39.110 --> 29:40.512
What's this about?

29:40.612 --> 29:43.014
A woman was raped in Old City,
last night.

29:43.114 --> 29:44.682
I'm sorry to hear that.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.684
Where were you last night, Carl?

29:46.785 --> 29:48.853
At home. Reading.

29:48.953 --> 29:50.355
Can anyone verify that?

29:50.455 --> 29:52.524
My girlfriend and her daughter.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.659
You a big reader, Carl?

29:54.759 --> 29:55.760
You could say.

29:55.827 --> 29:57.428
You lived in the area
five years ago

29:57.495 --> 29:59.330
when three women
were raped.

29:59.430 --> 30:01.299
Do you remember anything
about that?

30:01.366 --> 30:03.201
- Not really.
- Mm.

30:03.301 --> 30:05.003
But you heard
about it, right?

30:05.103 --> 30:07.205
Yeah, I think I remember
something about it

30:07.305 --> 30:08.773
but that was a long time ago.

30:11.643 --> 30:14.612
This looks a lot like you,
don't you think?

30:14.679 --> 30:15.713
Sort of.

30:17.182 --> 30:19.350
Can you arrest a man for
looking like a drawing?

30:19.450 --> 30:21.152
We're asking guys
who look like this picture

30:21.219 --> 30:23.354
to take a DNA test.
Would you do that?

30:24.989 --> 30:28.560
I'm sorry,
I prefer not to.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.496
'Look, I'd love
to help you out'

30:31.563 --> 30:34.299
but I got to get back.
New job and all.

30:34.365 --> 30:37.068
So, is there anything else?

30:37.168 --> 30:38.203
No.

30:49.247 --> 30:50.415
Crap.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.852
It was a Kenfield filter.

31:01.826 --> 31:05.597
Carl and I used
to date, so..

31:05.697 --> 31:07.198
Well, you lived together.

31:07.265 --> 31:08.933
That's a bit different
than dating, isn't it?

31:09.033 --> 31:11.703
Cait, honey, take dolly
and play in the room, okay?

31:14.505 --> 31:16.040
We lived together
five years ago.

31:16.107 --> 31:17.609
We broke up when he moved.

31:17.709 --> 31:21.613
If you broke up,
how'd you get this Army picture?

31:24.582 --> 31:25.884
We kept in touch.

31:25.950 --> 31:28.286
Caitlin says that Carl's
still your boyfriend.

31:28.386 --> 31:30.788
That he's around
the apartment a lot.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.558
Yeah, well..
Maybe I never got over him.

31:33.625 --> 31:35.293
Do you remember
those rapes five years ago?

31:35.393 --> 31:37.428
Yeah.

31:37.528 --> 31:39.697
Do you remember that
a girl was murdered?

31:41.532 --> 31:44.302
What, you trying to say
that was Carl?

31:44.402 --> 31:45.904
This is the guy.

31:45.970 --> 31:47.472
You tell me, Bridget.

31:51.409 --> 31:54.145
No. Carl is a good person.

31:54.245 --> 31:55.947
He is.

31:56.047 --> 31:58.149
He is. You'll should
see him with Caitlin

31:58.249 --> 31:59.484
and the animals.

31:59.584 --> 32:00.919
Down at that shelter
you work at?

32:00.985 --> 32:03.288
Yeah, he helps out sometimes.

32:03.388 --> 32:05.757
- You got any pets here?
- No, no.

32:05.823 --> 32:08.259
Carl always says
that dogs are for families

32:08.326 --> 32:10.595
and cats
are for single girls.

32:10.662 --> 32:11.829
Mm. Carl says that, huh?

32:11.930 --> 32:13.331
Yeah, we joke about it.

32:13.431 --> 32:15.600
You know, cats and book clubs.

32:15.667 --> 32:18.569
Two sure signs that a woman's
all alone in the world.

32:18.636 --> 32:21.272
I'm guessing you wouldn't be
caught dead at a book club.

32:23.274 --> 32:26.077
I noticed your Shakespeare
collection over there.

32:26.144 --> 32:29.147
Yeah, Carl got that
at a garage sale.

32:29.247 --> 32:31.316
You guys read
the tragedies together?

32:31.416 --> 32:34.585
He looks at 'em sometimes.
I don't like books.

32:36.354 --> 32:39.324
Maybe that's why
he took off five years ago.

32:39.424 --> 32:41.292
What do you mean?

32:43.294 --> 32:46.030
- Nothing.
- No, what?

32:46.130 --> 32:47.598
We talked to Carl
earlier today

32:47.665 --> 32:49.167
and he just wasn't, uh..

32:49.267 --> 32:55.139
very complimentary
about your...brain power.

32:58.977 --> 32:59.978
That's mean.

33:00.044 --> 33:01.479
I thought so.

33:03.648 --> 33:04.849
Was he with you last night?

33:06.617 --> 33:08.219
Yeah, he was here.

33:08.319 --> 33:11.222
- He go out after?
- He went out for a walk, late.

33:11.322 --> 33:13.291
'Cause there was
another rape last night.

33:13.358 --> 33:14.392
Another woman

33:14.492 --> 33:16.494
who lives alone,
with a cat.

33:18.496 --> 33:20.698
Carl take a lot of walks?

33:20.798 --> 33:25.136
Yeah. He has trouble sleeping.

33:25.203 --> 33:26.871
He always did.

33:40.918 --> 33:43.554
Honey, what's wrong?

33:43.654 --> 33:46.357
Nothing.
Can't sleep is all.

33:46.424 --> 33:49.594
Come back to bed.

33:49.694 --> 33:50.928
I'm gonna get some air.

33:51.029 --> 33:53.064
Okay.

33:53.164 --> 33:55.066
Be careful.

33:55.166 --> 33:56.501
You, too.

33:56.567 --> 33:58.436
Keep the windows closed.

34:01.572 --> 34:05.009
Yeah, he-he did that a lot.

34:05.076 --> 34:08.413
He'd leave in the middle
of the night.

34:08.513 --> 34:10.181
Didn't you think
it was pretty odd

34:10.248 --> 34:12.016
that he shaved like that,
Bridget?

34:12.083 --> 34:13.684
He always shaved, you know?

34:13.751 --> 34:15.286
He said, um..

34:15.386 --> 34:17.789
It had to do, you know,
with biking, for speed.

34:17.889 --> 34:19.957
(Rush)
'Did he always shave
at midnight?'

34:20.058 --> 34:21.225
I don't know.

34:21.292 --> 34:24.062
You remember the rapes
though, don't you?

34:24.128 --> 34:25.763
Yeah.

34:25.863 --> 34:26.964
Didn't you ever think--

34:27.065 --> 34:28.466
That I was living
with a rapist?

34:28.566 --> 34:31.202
No, I never thought that.
Would you?

34:35.973 --> 34:39.377
Does it make sense now?

34:43.448 --> 34:45.416
Yeah, I guess.

34:45.483 --> 34:47.618
'With the walks and all.'

34:47.718 --> 34:48.986
'Now that I think about it'

34:49.087 --> 34:50.988
he's only ridden that bike
a couple times

34:51.089 --> 34:52.924
since I've known him.

34:57.762 --> 34:58.830
Hey, Bridge.

34:59.931 --> 35:02.633
I'm so sorry, Carl.

35:02.733 --> 35:05.269
You really should
be more careful.

35:05.336 --> 35:09.440
I just wish we could've met
under different circumstances.

35:12.743 --> 35:14.679
Why are you here?

35:14.779 --> 35:17.315
We just wanna chat. Again.

35:19.851 --> 35:21.686
We called the base
up in Oregon.

35:21.786 --> 35:24.122
Seems you got the same
blood type as our rapist.

35:24.188 --> 35:27.358
[chuckles]
Type A is pretty common.

35:27.458 --> 35:29.861
We've got
your letter, too.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.195
[chuckling]
I'm not much of a writer.

35:31.295 --> 35:33.030
Plus that cigarette
you left at Tanya's

35:33.131 --> 35:35.366
tells me you're just about
ready to stop this.

35:35.466 --> 35:36.801
How'd them army boys
deal with you

35:36.868 --> 35:37.935
shaving your chest
and your legs?

35:38.002 --> 35:39.170
I cut that out up there.

35:39.270 --> 35:40.304
Didn't want to be
on the wrong side

35:40.371 --> 35:42.140
of "don't ask, don't tell," huh?

35:42.206 --> 35:44.475
I just didn't get much of
a chance to bike in Oregon.

35:44.542 --> 35:45.776
Yeah.

35:45.843 --> 35:50.148
Hmm. What kind of people
do you come from, Carl?

35:50.214 --> 35:51.649
Nothing special.

35:51.716 --> 35:53.985
- Educated?
- No.

35:54.051 --> 35:55.119
Low rent?

35:57.688 --> 35:58.956
You could say.

35:59.023 --> 36:01.392
Not a lot of books
in the trailer, I take it?

36:01.492 --> 36:04.195
My mom couldn't read.

36:04.295 --> 36:05.830
(Vera)
What about that sister of yours?

36:05.897 --> 36:08.065
The one that's in jail
for prostitution?

36:08.166 --> 36:10.001
She a...big scholar?

36:10.067 --> 36:12.403
Yeah, you come from trash,
you end up trash.

36:12.503 --> 36:14.705
(Rush)
'With a trash girlfriend,
you were looking'

36:14.805 --> 36:15.806
'for someone better.'

36:15.873 --> 36:19.477
A classy girl with education.

36:19.544 --> 36:21.812
I like girls with culture
who don't eat their takeout

36:21.879 --> 36:22.880
right out of a box.

36:22.980 --> 36:24.215
Hm, like Bridget?

36:24.315 --> 36:26.417
Bridget's never been
to a museum in her life.

36:26.517 --> 36:28.019
So you went looking for a girl

36:28.085 --> 36:29.921
with a little something
upstairs.

36:30.021 --> 36:31.689
(Vera)
'Trolling through the museums
and libraries'

36:31.756 --> 36:34.258
till you found her,
then you followed her home.

36:34.358 --> 36:36.093
Looked to see if there was
a cat in her window

36:36.194 --> 36:38.496
'cause that meant
she was all alone in there.

36:38.563 --> 36:41.566
And you got that talent
for getting into tiny places.

36:47.872 --> 36:51.509
Talk or don't talk,
it doesn't matter anymore.

36:53.444 --> 36:54.912
Bridget gave us your razor.

36:55.012 --> 36:58.449
- It's at the DNA lab right now.
- Yep.

36:58.549 --> 37:00.551
We're just waiting
for the official word.

37:13.364 --> 37:15.700
I used to slide down
the laundry chute

37:15.766 --> 37:17.902
at my best friend's building.

37:17.969 --> 37:21.472
You can't believe
how narrow it was.

37:21.572 --> 37:26.644
I'd get into the neighbors'
house and steal things.

37:26.744 --> 37:31.415
It was, like, the one thing that
I was really really good at.

37:31.482 --> 37:34.986
Getting into small places.

37:35.086 --> 37:38.489
I was, like,
known for it.

37:39.957 --> 37:42.226
That's sensational, Carl.

37:45.830 --> 37:48.833
I told you,
I was ready soon

37:48.933 --> 37:51.469
as soon as
the weather changed.

37:51.569 --> 37:55.072
Yeah. You told us.

37:55.139 --> 37:57.174
I just had these demons.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.677
Is that why you joined
the military?

37:59.777 --> 38:01.178
To maybe get
some discipline?

38:01.279 --> 38:04.815
I kept them down for a while,
but they came back.

38:04.915 --> 38:08.185
The one in Oregon was a fighter,
like the other one that--

38:08.286 --> 38:10.354
Gail.

38:10.454 --> 38:12.490
'The girl you murdered.'

38:14.258 --> 38:16.127
I just wanted to..

38:16.193 --> 38:18.663
...date her, you know,
not hurt her.

39:50.621 --> 39:53.357
Quiet. I am sorry.

39:53.424 --> 39:54.892
Studying, huh?

39:54.959 --> 39:57.428
- College girl?
- Let me...go!

40:04.935 --> 40:06.637
You should be more careful.

40:06.737 --> 40:08.539
That window's wide open.

40:08.606 --> 40:09.907
[knock on door]
'Gail?'

40:09.974 --> 40:11.642
- 'Be quiet.'
- 'What's going on in there? '

40:11.742 --> 40:12.943
Keep quiet, quiet, quiet.

40:13.043 --> 40:14.078
(neighbor)
'Sounds like more than reading.'

40:14.145 --> 40:15.946
(Carl)
Quiet. Quiet.

40:18.582 --> 40:24.054
I just wish we'd met
under different circumstances.

43:18.762 --> 43:20.397
(Rush)
Stay tuned for scenes
