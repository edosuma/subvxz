WEBVTT

00:19.751 --> 00:20.751
Are you alone?

00:42.971 --> 00:44.128
You bring it?

00:46.783 --> 00:48.477
You're doing the right thing.

00:48.501 --> 00:50.853
I know I'm doing the
right thing. I'm just...

00:50.877 --> 00:53.705
I'm still not sure you're the
one I should be doing it with.

00:53.729 --> 00:56.824
You're not exactly a
man with many options.

00:58.210 --> 01:00.636
Come on.

01:04.407 --> 01:05.720
Get down!

01:15.631 --> 01:16.806
You hit?

02:21.646 --> 02:23.342
What's wrong with this picture?

02:23.366 --> 02:26.092
You mean aside from the
Director being out at 4:00 a. m.

02:26.116 --> 02:28.154
And a dead homeless man in her car?

02:28.178 --> 02:29.466
No, that about covers it.

02:29.490 --> 02:30.568
Not quite.

02:30.592 --> 02:33.599
His alley-mates don't think he's
homeless. Said he showed up last night.

02:33.623 --> 02:36.841
He looked dirty, but smelled
like he had just taken a bath.

02:36.865 --> 02:40.077
- Said he didn't talk to anyone.
- He talked to somebody.

02:41.135 --> 02:42.338
It's a nice phone.

02:42.594 --> 02:44.207
The Director's on another Op.

02:44.231 --> 02:45.967
If she is, I'm not in on it.

02:45.991 --> 02:47.657
Would you tell us if you were?

02:52.662 --> 02:55.920
Name's Troy Webster. He
had information I needed.

02:55.944 --> 02:57.047
The Frog.

02:57.795 --> 03:00.590
Getting La Grenouille
on ARES is off-limits,

03:00.614 --> 03:02.670
but with what Webster had,

03:02.694 --> 03:04.235
I still could have nailed
Grenouille to the wall.

03:04.259 --> 03:07.198
And the reason I'm finding
out about this right now...

03:07.222 --> 03:10.064
or you gonna quote Rule
Number Four to me again?

03:10.088 --> 03:12.451
Are you gonna quote Rule
Number One back at me?

03:12.475 --> 03:14.396
What were you doing out here alone?

03:14.420 --> 03:16.973
- I can take care of myself, Jethro.
- Right.

03:16.997 --> 03:18.702
Who was taking care of him?

03:18.726 --> 03:21.994
Well, from this point
forward, that would be me.

03:25.295 --> 03:27.624
Well, it's not anything I said.

03:27.648 --> 03:29.452
Any witnesses get an
I.D. on the vehicle?

03:29.476 --> 03:31.859
All I got is some kind of truck.

03:32.042 --> 03:33.022
Plates were missing.

03:33.046 --> 03:37.471
It was a dark Limited Edition,
Ford Excursion. Tinted windows.

03:37.495 --> 03:40.200
Off-road tires. Broken taillight.

03:40.224 --> 03:42.926
And, uh... now missing a rear window.

03:42.950 --> 03:44.841
You got off a few rounds.

03:44.865 --> 03:47.385
I don't take kindly to being shot at.

03:47.659 --> 03:49.422
Was he shooting you or him?

03:49.446 --> 03:52.467
Director of NCIS is
a high-value target.

03:52.721 --> 03:54.782
Whereas this guy is..

03:57.977 --> 04:00.312
His name is Troy Webster.

04:00.659 --> 04:02.102
Troy Webster.

04:02.446 --> 04:04.266
Never met a dollar he couldn't launder.

04:04.290 --> 04:08.397
A certified CPA with offices in the
Isle of Man, Dubai and the Caymans.

04:08.421 --> 04:10.025
His number one client...

04:11.662 --> 04:12.718
The Frog.

04:13.356 --> 04:14.456
La Grenouille.

04:14.480 --> 04:16.702
Your favorite international
arms dealer and mine.

04:16.726 --> 04:18.599
Wasn't Webster's favorite.

04:18.623 --> 04:19.913
At least not anymore.

04:19.937 --> 04:21.137
They had a falling out?

04:21.161 --> 04:24.887
Webster woke up one day, and realized
he had sold his soul to the devil.

04:24.911 --> 04:27.139
Too bad the devil doesn't give refunds.

04:27.163 --> 04:28.768
Webster knew the risks.

04:28.792 --> 04:30.224
What was the reward?

04:30.283 --> 04:33.765
He was bringing me a file on La
Grenouille's entire operation,

04:33.789 --> 04:36.654
down to the last dock
invoice, past and future.

04:36.678 --> 04:38.828
Next arms shipment he made,
we could have nailed him.

04:38.852 --> 04:41.850
France would have had no choice
but to extradite him to the U.S.

04:41.874 --> 04:43.582
And he'd never know how we got to him.

04:43.606 --> 04:45.640
The only thing we found
on Webster was his cell.

04:45.664 --> 04:46.667
No file.

04:46.830 --> 04:48.374
The cell's flash drive was empty, but

04:48.398 --> 04:50.326
that doesn't mean there
couldn't be a hidden directory.

04:50.350 --> 04:52.447
- McGee, get the drive down to Abby...
- Down to Abby and see if she can pull

04:52.471 --> 04:54.344
- anything off of it.
- DiNozzo, Ziva,

04:54.368 --> 04:55.511
- Follow up every lead...
- Follow up every lead...

04:55.535 --> 04:58.850
you have on the shooter,
and report directly to me.

05:11.464 --> 05:14.053
I sure would like to be a
fly on the wall up there.

05:16.041 --> 05:17.301
Never mind.

05:32.171 --> 05:34.157
I suppose I should say thank you.

05:34.181 --> 05:35.212
For?

05:36.671 --> 05:39.333
For not calling me out
when you had a right to.

05:41.592 --> 05:45.075
I apologize. It's your
team. I was out of order.

05:45.130 --> 05:46.279
Whose team?

05:47.993 --> 05:49.033
Your team.

05:53.706 --> 05:55.184
Want me to get the shades?

05:55.749 --> 05:58.322
I'm through sitting in
the dark looking at photos.

05:58.346 --> 06:00.287
Yeah. I noticed.

06:01.436 --> 06:03.370
You think I'm being reckless.

06:03.394 --> 06:04.910
What do you think?

06:05.173 --> 06:08.538
I think I'm taking the same chances
that you did when you were after Ari.

06:08.562 --> 06:10.698
I wasn't the Director of NCIS.

06:10.722 --> 06:11.824
But I am.

06:12.598 --> 06:14.140
It gives me prerogatives.

06:22.042 --> 06:25.526
Troy Webster initiated contact
with me three months ago.

06:26.099 --> 06:27.321
Then he got cold feet.

06:27.620 --> 06:28.784
Until last night.

06:29.243 --> 06:30.961
He called after midnight.

06:30.985 --> 06:33.356
Said he had information
on an arms shipment

06:33.380 --> 06:35.189
to an American supplier happening soon.

06:35.213 --> 06:37.850
It was an opportunity
I could not pass up.

06:38.285 --> 06:40.111
Which Webster would have known.

06:40.848 --> 06:42.761
It wasn't a trap.

06:42.785 --> 06:43.785
You sure?

06:44.562 --> 06:47.413
You're still assuming
Webster was the target.

06:51.062 --> 06:52.884
He could have been the bait.

06:53.750 --> 06:55.218
Do you get it now?

06:56.677 --> 06:59.705
The real question is, why
didn't you get it sooner?

07:00.635 --> 07:05.474
You think my personal feelings about
La Grenouille are clouding my judgment?

07:08.127 --> 07:10.848
You don't know what my
personal feelings are.

07:10.872 --> 07:11.872
Right.

07:13.116 --> 07:14.339
I have no need to know.

07:20.252 --> 07:23.085
How far are you willing
to go to get this guy, Jen?

07:26.817 --> 07:30.555
As far as you went to get Ari, Jethro.

07:34.093 --> 07:38.629
It was 1917 before Mata
Hari was finally arrested,

07:38.653 --> 07:43.434
although the French had no concrete
proof that she was spying for the Germans.

07:44.364 --> 07:47.597
Yeah, but who needs proof
when accusation will suffice?

07:47.621 --> 07:51.609
Strange to say, it was the
Germans who deliberately

07:51.633 --> 07:53.888
leaked that she was working for them,

07:53.912 --> 07:57.943
thus reinforcing the spy
world's oldest maxim...

07:57.967 --> 07:59.206
Don't be a spy?

07:59.608 --> 08:01.431
Trust no one.

08:01.723 --> 08:05.023
You would have made a lousy
agent provocateur, Jethro.

08:05.047 --> 08:07.084
Well, thank you, Duck. I'll
take that as a compliment.

08:07.108 --> 08:10.001
I'm just taking my own
advice, trying to confirm.

08:10.025 --> 08:12.865
Abby's fingerprint I.D. somehow.

08:12.889 --> 08:15.022
You got a reason to
think they won't match?

08:15.296 --> 08:17.266
Well, you never know in this game.

08:17.389 --> 08:20.344
Duck, I also don't know
what I'm doing here.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.016
Oh. Oh, yes. Well, I
do have some information

08:24.040 --> 08:27.825
that you may find useful
as well as inexplicable.

08:28.117 --> 08:29.795
Take a look at this.

08:29.819 --> 08:33.880
One bullet perfectly bisected
the inferior vena cava.

08:34.191 --> 08:38.495
Another, the superior vena
cava. Also a perfect bisection.

08:38.714 --> 08:39.826
Two in the chest.

08:40.131 --> 08:41.845
And one in the head.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.289
Almost dead center.

08:44.821 --> 08:48.634
Standard execution-style,
but with astounding accuracy.

08:48.908 --> 08:51.091
- Troy Webster was the target.
- Yeah.

08:51.115 --> 08:55.902
If the shooter had wanted the Director
dead, he would not have missed.

08:56.522 --> 09:01.738
As for Troy Webster, the shooter
may have wasted his bullets.

09:02.102 --> 09:05.329
The patient suffered from
an elevated protein level

09:05.353 --> 09:07.010
in his cerebral spinal fluid.

09:07.034 --> 09:11.235
I didn't think much of it at the
time until I opened up his cranium.

09:11.259 --> 09:12.981
And I found this.

09:13.400 --> 09:16.154
It's almost certainly malignant.

09:16.501 --> 09:19.008
- Brain tumor.
- And inoperable.

09:19.337 --> 09:21.562
He would have been dead in six weeks.

09:21.835 --> 09:23.876
That might explain why
he had a change of heart.

09:23.900 --> 09:25.191
If he knew about it.

09:25.322 --> 09:29.931
I also took the precaution of
acquiring his medical records.

09:29.955 --> 09:33.093
Given the size of this tumor,

09:33.117 --> 09:36.236
I'd think he would have
known something was amiss.

09:36.260 --> 09:38.237
He would have said
something to his doctor,

09:38.261 --> 09:43.382
but there's no mention of any
abnormality, far less cancer.

09:43.638 --> 09:45.256
Any chance they could have missed it?

09:45.280 --> 09:49.768
No. I am at a loss to explain
it. Hence the word "inexplicable".

09:50.775 --> 09:53.766
Hello, hello. What is this?

09:54.076 --> 09:55.676
The backup generators is kicking in.

09:55.700 --> 09:57.121
Sorry!

09:57.504 --> 09:58.982
That was me.

10:00.496 --> 10:02.238
I think it's out.

10:03.332 --> 10:05.703
Have you ever seen anything like this?

10:06.123 --> 10:07.386
What's going on?

10:08.386 --> 10:09.363
You two okay?

10:09.387 --> 10:10.810
Well, we're fine.

10:11.252 --> 10:12.711
Bertha...

10:12.875 --> 10:15.326
- She's toast.
- What happened?

10:15.350 --> 10:17.626
Well, we were trying to
access Webster's smartphone.

10:17.650 --> 10:19.596
Turned out there was some
sort of hidden partition.

10:19.620 --> 10:22.081
We must have triggered
some sort of fail-safe.

10:22.105 --> 10:24.115
Which uploaded a virus on Abby's system.

10:24.139 --> 10:25.455
A virus did this?

10:25.479 --> 10:28.390
No. But it tricked our
surge protector into thinking

10:28.414 --> 10:31.127
that there was a lightning
strike that killed the power.

10:31.151 --> 10:33.963
When the backups kicked in, it
overloaded our distribution node.

10:33.987 --> 10:37.775
Were you able to pull anything off
the phone before it self-destructed?

10:37.799 --> 10:39.998
No. Surge took care of that.

10:40.022 --> 10:42.218
Pretty Mission: Impossible, huh?

10:42.242 --> 10:45.091
Can you retrieve any data?

10:46.276 --> 10:48.113
There's no data left to retrieve.

10:48.137 --> 10:52.279
Anything that Webster would have
had on La Grenouille, it's gone.

10:53.865 --> 10:54.940
Aw, somebody need...

10:54.964 --> 10:57.740
- This was careless!
- Jen.

10:57.764 --> 11:02.108
How many more lives are going to be
ruined before we bring that monster in?

11:02.132 --> 11:04.247
How many have been ruined so far?

11:07.767 --> 11:10.187
It's not over. We
still have Troy Webster.

11:10.211 --> 11:11.755
Not sure how much
talking he's going to do.

11:11.779 --> 11:13.242
He doesn't need to.

11:13.266 --> 11:16.178
Webster was going to bring us
La Grenouille for arms dealing.

11:16.202 --> 11:19.294
Now he's going to bring
him to us for murder.

11:31.883 --> 11:33.327
This ever happened before?

11:33.631 --> 11:34.631
No.

11:34.849 --> 11:36.160
What'd you say to them?

11:36.746 --> 11:38.856
I told them to send someone over.

11:38.880 --> 11:40.277
You want to see the CIA,

11:41.195 --> 11:43.295
you always do it on their
turf and their terms.

11:43.319 --> 11:46.308
Maybe they've finally figured it
out that we're all on the same team.

11:46.332 --> 11:48.004
It doesn't mean they're
going to play ball.

11:48.028 --> 11:51.598
After the way we salvaged
ARES for them, they owe us.

11:52.838 --> 11:53.838
Yes, Cynthia?

11:53.987 --> 11:55.883
You appointment's arrived, Director.

11:56.696 --> 11:57.788
Send them in.

12:03.573 --> 12:04.681
Agent Fornell?

12:04.973 --> 12:06.590
Jenny. Jethro.

12:06.614 --> 12:08.362
Get lost on your way to work, Tobias?

12:08.386 --> 12:11.362
We were expecting someone
from the CIA, not FBI.

12:11.386 --> 12:13.548
As you know, I'm on attachment
to Homeland Security.

12:13.572 --> 12:15.092
That doesn't make you CIA.

12:15.116 --> 12:16.921
And yet here I am, just the same.

12:16.945 --> 12:18.903
Langley hates the FBI.

12:18.927 --> 12:21.369
Yeah, but not so much as
they hate you right now.

12:21.393 --> 12:23.223
You really pissed them
off over something.

12:23.247 --> 12:26.003
And so you volunteered
to smooth things out.

12:26.321 --> 12:28.534
Not exactly "volunteered".

12:28.558 --> 12:30.312
I just drew the short straw.

12:31.002 --> 12:32.782
So you guys want to tell
me what this is all about?

12:32.806 --> 12:34.405
'Cause they didn't tell me squat.

12:34.429 --> 12:37.129
I need face time with one
of their undercover assets.

12:37.153 --> 12:39.919
- Name?
- Trent Kort. Alias.

12:41.759 --> 12:45.177
- They're gonna want to know why.
- On going NCIS investigation.

12:45.450 --> 12:46.996
That's it?

12:47.020 --> 12:49.207
One of my informants was killed.

12:49.231 --> 12:52.176
I believe Kort has information
to help me find the killer.

12:52.200 --> 12:55.414
That sounds reasonable. On the
other hand, this is the CIA,

12:55.438 --> 12:58.300
so they're probably going to
tell me to tell you to go to hell.

12:58.324 --> 13:00.625
Remind them they owe us.

13:01.299 --> 13:05.129
And if you want to know why, ask them.

13:12.261 --> 13:14.510
And who said the old days were dead.

13:15.637 --> 13:16.735
Not them.

13:20.783 --> 13:23.556
Well, I guess hell hasn't
frozen over after all.

13:35.928 --> 13:37.168
Thank God you're here.

13:39.015 --> 13:40.647
I told you to come alone.

13:40.671 --> 13:42.890
Look, I'm through keeping
secrets on this one, Abs.

13:42.914 --> 13:45.188
- If it's about the case...
- We are all ears.

13:45.212 --> 13:47.359
Is that like being a fly on the wall?

13:47.383 --> 13:49.555
Okay, but don't say I didn't warn you.

13:49.579 --> 13:51.492
Per strict instructions
from Director Shepard,

13:51.516 --> 13:54.303
I'm going over all the crime scene
evidence with a fine-tooth comb.

13:54.327 --> 13:57.321
- Anything good?
- Tire marks confirm the make and model

13:57.345 --> 14:00.478
- of the drive-by vehicle.
- Which we already know from the Director.

14:00.502 --> 14:02.368
I'm just getting warmed up here.

14:02.392 --> 14:04.159
The striations on the slugs

14:04.183 --> 14:07.277
from the Director's car match
the slugs from Troy Webster.

14:07.301 --> 14:09.360
I didn't find any of
the Director's slugs.

14:09.384 --> 14:10.740
That's 'cause she didn't miss.

14:10.764 --> 14:14.152
I did find something interesting
on the window she shattered.

14:20.131 --> 14:21.428
Blood.

14:21.452 --> 14:24.432
Even though blood spatter
can travel for several meters,

14:24.456 --> 14:27.786
the SUV was too far away for
this to be Troy Webster's.

14:28.144 --> 14:30.370
She hit one of La Grenouille's men.

14:30.394 --> 14:33.555
Through a tinted window. In
a car going 40 miles an hour.

14:33.579 --> 14:34.814
Rock on, Jenny.

14:34.838 --> 14:36.637
But was it the shooter or the driver?

14:36.661 --> 14:38.867
- Enough to pull DNA?
- I'm running it now.

14:38.891 --> 14:40.203
Let us know.

14:42.163 --> 14:45.760
Actually, it's what I found
inside the Director's car

14:45.784 --> 14:48.145
that I'm not really
sure what to do with.

14:48.831 --> 14:50.016
What'd you find?

14:55.651 --> 14:57.564
They were in her glove compartment.

14:57.588 --> 14:59.184
What was that doing in
her glove compartment?

14:59.208 --> 15:02.685
I don't know. But I'm sure the
Director doesn't want her...

15:02.709 --> 15:05.121
personal business on an inventory log

15:05.145 --> 15:07.249
for the entire federal
government to read.

15:07.273 --> 15:08.252
Not this business.

15:08.276 --> 15:10.120
And I can't take it off the
log. That would be a crime.

15:10.144 --> 15:11.684
Maybe you should ask
the Director what to do.

15:11.708 --> 15:13.596
I am not having that conversation.

15:15.897 --> 15:17.105
But you could.

15:18.239 --> 15:19.216
Me?

15:19.240 --> 15:21.883
Yes, you are the senior field agent.

15:21.993 --> 15:24.473
And you never hesitate to remind us.

15:27.269 --> 15:31.500
As your senior field
agent, I say we draw straws.

15:32.685 --> 15:35.561
Here, hold that... thought for a second.

15:37.919 --> 15:39.182
Hey, what are you wearing?

15:39.206 --> 15:40.397
Scrubs.

15:41.284 --> 15:42.810
Scrubs can be sexy.

15:42.834 --> 15:44.990
You've got sex on the
brain, you know that?

15:45.014 --> 15:47.564
Well, why fight a billion
years of evolutionary drive?

15:47.588 --> 15:50.208
I don't know, you're the one
who made me wait, remember?

15:50.232 --> 15:53.000
Well, the good news is, those
dark days are long behind us.

15:53.024 --> 15:55.834
I've got some good news
myself. My mother is in town.

15:57.292 --> 15:59.225
And she wants to meet you.

16:01.453 --> 16:04.758
Apparently you and I have very
different definitions of the word "good".

16:04.782 --> 16:07.725
I would think you'd be the kind of guy
that's had a lot of practice meeting parents.

16:07.749 --> 16:09.603
Actually, no.

16:09.627 --> 16:13.096
Right. Never made it that far.

16:13.880 --> 16:16.615
There's a first time for everything.

16:17.600 --> 16:19.734
Hey, hey, you...

16:20.863 --> 16:22.062
What was that?

16:22.086 --> 16:24.954
Uh, kind of hard to explain.

16:25.058 --> 16:27.610
Maybe explain it to my
mother and me over dinner.

16:27.634 --> 16:30.177
Oh, Jeanne, I'm sorry I'm, I'm...

16:30.401 --> 16:32.026
I'm going to have to work late tonight.

16:32.050 --> 16:34.066
What kind of a lame excuse is that?

16:35.131 --> 16:40.105
Well, it is lame, but it's not
an excuse. I'll see what I can do.

16:40.129 --> 16:42.777
I promise I'll make it worth your while.

16:43.397 --> 16:45.246
Bribery will get you everywhere.

16:46.604 --> 16:47.644
Bye.

16:47.863 --> 16:49.030
Bye.

16:55.717 --> 16:56.975
Director.

17:00.547 --> 17:03.224
Schedule a briefing in an
hour and get me Agent DiNozzo.

17:03.248 --> 17:05.343
- Yes, ma'am.
- You got him.

17:07.123 --> 17:09.574
I know Gibbs teaches you to anticipate,

17:09.738 --> 17:11.848
but I didn't even know I
need you until a second ago.

17:11.873 --> 17:14.310
You know, when you're good, you're good.

17:14.395 --> 17:15.423
What's on your mind?

17:19.122 --> 17:20.271
You first.

17:22.749 --> 17:27.012
The GPS marker you tagged with Regine
Smidt's luggage with has gone dark.

17:27.036 --> 17:28.740
Maybe it's out of batteries.

17:30.931 --> 17:32.727
Well, that means she found it.

17:33.156 --> 17:35.949
How? Little bugger's
supposed to be undetectable.

17:35.973 --> 17:37.737
I'm more concerned with when.

17:37.993 --> 17:39.885
She told La Grenouille.

17:39.909 --> 17:43.409
And if she managed to ascertain
the time her luggage was tagged...

17:43.998 --> 17:46.598
He might be able to
figure out who tagged it.

17:49.844 --> 17:52.591
Just when I thought my
day couldn't get any worse.

17:54.313 --> 17:55.475
Fornell.

17:55.499 --> 17:57.416
- Forward that file to my office, please.
- Yes.

17:57.440 --> 17:58.663
Fornell?

17:58.687 --> 18:01.377
He's been assigned as
our liaison with CIA.

18:01.401 --> 18:04.211
They chose him because they thought
it'd make you easier to handle?

18:04.235 --> 18:07.352
Actually, he said the agents
drew straws for the duty.

18:07.376 --> 18:10.455
Apparently, my reputation precedes me.

18:10.752 --> 18:15.923
It's hard to imagine grown adults drawing
straws just to deal with little old me.

18:19.940 --> 18:22.135
What was it you wanted to ask me again?

18:36.689 --> 18:37.809
Come to Mama.

18:49.123 --> 18:50.318
Beautiful.

18:51.977 --> 18:53.782
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:54.318 --> 18:56.568
It's kind of a tradition
when I get new equipment.

18:56.592 --> 18:59.443
So I guess you're here for the
results of the blood I found?

18:59.467 --> 19:02.316
- I heard you got a hit on the DNA.
- Yes, and no.

19:02.340 --> 19:04.295
Let's start with the yes part, Abs.

19:04.319 --> 19:07.353
I'm down here by myself all day
long, and I finally have some company.

19:07.377 --> 19:08.795
So, don't make me rush this.

19:08.819 --> 19:12.429
I isolated the DNA from the blood
on the SUV's glass fragments.

19:12.453 --> 19:14.945
The blood spatter indicated
that it came from the driver.

19:14.969 --> 19:18.665
So I ran the DNA through every database
I could think of, and I got nothing.

19:18.689 --> 19:21.983
- So, ask me why I'm smiling.
- You're always smiling, Abby.

19:22.007 --> 19:23.733
Well, that's 'cause I'm
a happy person, Gibbs.

19:23.757 --> 19:27.004
And I was especially happy when I
found out that our driver was a mutant.

19:27.222 --> 19:29.493
I mean, we all have mutations
in our DNA technically...

19:29.517 --> 19:30.975
Abby.

19:31.005 --> 19:36.566
The owner had a genetic defect at position
370 on his glucosidase beta acid gene.

19:36.803 --> 19:39.277
It's called Gaucher's Disease.

19:40.005 --> 19:41.666
- Rare?
- It's rare enough.

19:41.690 --> 19:44.798
It's treated with an
enzyme-replacement drug called Ceredase.

19:44.822 --> 19:48.332
There's only three pharmacies within
a hundred-mile radius that carry it,

19:48.356 --> 19:50.358
and there's only one patient taking it.

19:50.382 --> 19:51.611
You got an address?

19:51.635 --> 19:53.304
Do you even have to ask?

19:56.365 --> 19:57.423
Thank you.

20:03.965 --> 20:06.083
- Nice place.
- Apartment 212.

20:09.491 --> 20:11.482
- Warrant.
- Right here.

20:11.883 --> 20:13.028
Federal agents!

20:13.052 --> 20:14.669
Boss, Agent Lee wanted me to remind you

20:14.693 --> 20:16.959
we need to wait at least 15 seconds...

20:19.165 --> 20:20.187
Clear!

20:23.086 --> 20:26.299
Well, this guy was either practicing
for his plastic surgery finals...

20:26.323 --> 20:28.388
Or he was injured in a drive-by.

20:29.683 --> 20:30.740
Not injured.

20:37.884 --> 20:38.913
Dead.

20:53.275 --> 20:54.438
Come in.

20:56.586 --> 20:57.627
Ducky.

20:57.651 --> 21:00.657
I was just reading your autopsy report.

21:02.520 --> 21:07.352
Lucky we don't have to worry about
finding this one's killer since it was me.

21:08.215 --> 21:11.680
Your bullet tore through his
brachial and carotid arteries

21:11.704 --> 21:13.499
and lodged against his clavicle.

21:13.955 --> 21:18.152
Someone tried to stitch up his wounds,
but without proper medical knowledge.

21:18.843 --> 21:21.424
I had La Grenouille by the throat.

21:22.171 --> 21:24.086
Then he had my informant killed.

21:24.653 --> 21:26.750
Fine. I'll make a murder case.

21:27.151 --> 21:29.302
And then I kill the star witness

21:29.326 --> 21:32.013
who could tie the murder
back to La Grenouille.

21:33.100 --> 21:34.277
Perfect.

21:35.029 --> 21:36.862
There's always the shooter.

21:38.080 --> 21:39.333
If we can find him.

21:39.590 --> 21:43.314
Though I doubt he would be
able to give you what you want.

21:54.467 --> 21:56.968
Is there something I can
do for you, Dr. Mallard?

21:56.992 --> 22:00.069
Yeah, I came to discuss
my preliminary findings.

22:02.634 --> 22:04.132
Isn't that what I just read?

22:04.156 --> 22:08.842
No, no, no. Not that. My
psychological profile of La Grenouille.

22:09.280 --> 22:12.350
It's not complete, but
under the circumstances,

22:12.374 --> 22:17.115
I thought it prudent to avail
you of what I've gathered so far.

22:17.589 --> 22:19.195
Avail me.

22:19.219 --> 22:22.168
Well, La Grenouille is not
your ordinary arms dealer.

22:22.460 --> 22:27.069
He's educated, refined, has
a keen appreciation of opera.

22:28.281 --> 22:29.813
And let's not forget cognac.

22:29.837 --> 22:33.213
Oh, I haven't. I will forever
remember his gift to me.

22:33.281 --> 22:35.924
Do you know that it was
a unique and rare bottle

22:35.948 --> 22:38.033
- of Napoleon br...
- Ducky, your point?

22:39.866 --> 22:43.269
He's not the type to settle
disputes with violence.

22:43.293 --> 22:44.691
He's an arms dealer.

22:44.715 --> 22:46.775
Who fancies himself a businessman.

22:47.158 --> 22:49.508
Now, he may be a merchant of death,

22:49.532 --> 22:54.011
but he's... he's no more likely
to solve a problem with violence

22:54.035 --> 22:57.446
than your typical tobacco company CEO.

22:57.470 --> 23:00.705
And we both know how many
people those products kill.

23:00.729 --> 23:05.733
So La Grenouille was going to let Troy
Webster turn state's evidence against him?

23:05.757 --> 23:08.380
I'm not suggesting he wouldn't
have dealt with those problems, but

23:08.404 --> 23:10.864
a man whose favorite opera

23:10.888 --> 23:14.512
is La Forza del Destino
is sophisticated.

23:14.786 --> 23:18.384
And he's far more likely to use
that sophistication as his weapon.

23:18.408 --> 23:22.455
Violent murder just... is not his style.

23:23.896 --> 23:25.167
You liked him, didn't you?

23:26.124 --> 23:27.382
Excuse me?

23:27.893 --> 23:29.170
La Grenouille.

23:30.008 --> 23:33.378
You found him charming?

23:33.402 --> 23:36.278
Well, I don't see how that's relevant.

23:37.604 --> 23:40.453
Well, I admit, for a mass murderer,

23:40.477 --> 23:43.674
he may have a certain... gracious charm.

23:43.802 --> 23:46.027
Perhaps it's clouding your judgment.

23:47.242 --> 23:50.177
Perhaps it's not my judgment
that's being clouded.

23:53.743 --> 23:55.354
You don't know him like I do.

23:55.867 --> 23:59.372
And exactly how is that, Director?

24:00.430 --> 24:01.688
Good night, Doctor.

24:12.820 --> 24:14.655
The dead driver appears
to be a dead end.

24:14.679 --> 24:17.256
Which makes the shooter
our last link La Grenouille.

24:17.280 --> 24:19.280
Better hope he's not dead, too.

24:19.304 --> 24:21.804
I'll start running down
his known associates.

24:37.553 --> 24:38.618
Jethro.

24:39.139 --> 24:40.343
Hey, Duck.

24:44.189 --> 24:46.250
You and the Director have a nice chat?

24:46.871 --> 24:49.174
Well, I wouldn't call it "nice".

24:50.450 --> 24:52.493
Illuminating, perhaps.

24:52.693 --> 24:54.658
- For who?
- Well, not for her.

24:54.682 --> 24:56.628
As you expected, she didn't...

24:56.652 --> 24:59.380
appreciate my thoughts on La Grenouille.

24:59.672 --> 25:02.713
She still thinks of
him as a prime suspect.

25:02.737 --> 25:04.245
- So do I.
- Yes, but

25:04.269 --> 25:07.017
you listen to my perspective,
and I have no doubt

25:07.041 --> 25:10.159
that your mind would change
if the facts were to change.

25:10.183 --> 25:11.679
And the Director's won't?

25:12.247 --> 25:13.812
It does not seem likely.

25:14.542 --> 25:16.702
- But why?
- Well, you don't need a degree

25:16.726 --> 25:20.192
in psychology to see that there's
a history between those two.

25:20.391 --> 25:22.942
Something that is consuming her.

25:23.216 --> 25:25.881
Her every... action, every thought.

25:26.246 --> 25:27.267
How far?

25:27.687 --> 25:28.687
Will she go?

25:29.621 --> 25:31.911
Well, as far as any obsessed person.

25:32.936 --> 25:34.283
As far as it takes.

25:36.982 --> 25:37.985
Jeanne,

25:38.095 --> 25:40.508
what is taking you so long? Your
mother could be here any second.

25:40.532 --> 25:42.920
Relax, Tony. I'm 20 feet away.

25:43.436 --> 25:46.098
Yeah, well, what am I supposed to do
if she comes in here while you're gone?

25:46.122 --> 25:48.726
Uh, say hello and introduce yourself.

25:48.750 --> 25:50.427
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

25:50.451 --> 25:53.173
What woman can resist
your usual charming self?

25:53.438 --> 25:54.438
Thanks.

25:56.677 --> 25:58.775
Hello. Hi.

26:03.186 --> 26:04.321
Show time.

26:04.345 --> 26:06.055
Hello, Dr. Berkley.

26:06.079 --> 26:07.860
- I'm, I'm Tony.
- I know who you are.

26:07.884 --> 26:10.947
My daughter told me you'd be
the one in the overpriced shoes.

26:11.549 --> 26:13.702
Zegna Oxfords?

26:14.668 --> 26:15.872
Good eyes.

26:16.688 --> 26:19.409
- What else did she tell you about me?
- Everything.

26:20.376 --> 26:22.326
I'm not quite sure what
worries me the most.

26:23.949 --> 26:26.028
Hi, baby. Hi, Mom.

26:27.252 --> 26:28.638
I see you two have met.

26:31.752 --> 26:32.752
Thank you.

26:37.098 --> 26:38.377
Thank you.

26:49.948 --> 26:51.288
You got to be kidding.

26:53.887 --> 26:55.017
Old habit.

27:11.634 --> 27:13.914
So, you're the overzealous Fed

27:13.938 --> 27:17.638
who nearly mucked up 18
months of undercover work.

27:17.662 --> 27:19.995
I prefer to think of it as doing my job.

27:20.019 --> 27:21.256
Gibbs.

27:21.495 --> 27:23.279
I'm not my Director's keeper.

27:23.303 --> 27:25.292
I don't have a lot of time.

27:25.316 --> 27:30.136
Grenouille thinks I'm in DC getting
dirt on a troublesome customs inspector.

27:30.555 --> 27:31.544
Well?

27:31.568 --> 27:34.239
Your boss killed my
informant two days ago.

27:37.376 --> 27:38.922
Informant got a name?

27:39.350 --> 27:40.419
Troy Webster.

27:40.443 --> 27:43.276
I need your help to take
La Grenouille down for it.

27:44.019 --> 27:45.727
You sure it was my boss?

27:45.751 --> 27:47.953
You have any information
to the contrary?

27:47.977 --> 27:50.866
No, but I've been working
with Grenouille a long time.

27:50.890 --> 27:52.945
I've never known him to order a hit.

27:52.969 --> 27:54.659
And if he did, you'd know?

27:54.683 --> 27:56.049
Not necessarily.

27:56.505 --> 28:00.184
Grenouille keeps information as
compartmentalized as possible,

28:00.208 --> 28:02.318
- where everything is...
- Need to know.

28:02.432 --> 28:06.597
Yeah. And accounting
is not my department.

28:06.834 --> 28:10.600
Still, I doubt Grenouille had
anything to do with the murder.

28:10.837 --> 28:12.497
It's just not his style.

28:12.679 --> 28:14.977
This isn't a fashion contest.

28:15.320 --> 28:17.197
I'm not asking for your opinion.

28:17.221 --> 28:20.660
I'm asking who La Grenouille
would have gotten for the hit.

28:25.293 --> 28:26.760
Andre Jones.

28:27.384 --> 28:30.293
He's Grenouille's American
small arms distributor.

28:31.624 --> 28:35.074
The kind of guy that's not
afraid to get his hands dirty.

28:35.098 --> 28:38.313
If Grenouille were to
contract a kill in the States,

28:38.337 --> 28:41.277
Jones would be the only man he'd trust.

28:44.870 --> 28:48.219
So, I told the rep from the HMO that
if he didn't authorize the transplant,

28:48.243 --> 28:51.163
that I'd give his number to the family,
and he could take it up with them.

28:51.470 --> 28:53.378
My mother is used to
getting what she wants.

28:53.402 --> 28:54.946
I don't doubt that for a second.

28:54.970 --> 28:58.983
I didn't become a doctor to do paperwork.
I became a doctor to be a doctor.

28:59.183 --> 29:01.610
As it is, the delay caused
a rupture in the bile duct.

29:01.634 --> 29:04.734
Which increases post-op
susceptibility to intestinal parasites.

29:05.007 --> 29:06.498
Very good, honey.

29:06.522 --> 29:09.462
Speaking of intestinal
parasites, how's your father?

29:09.511 --> 29:10.936
Mom, be good.

29:10.960 --> 29:13.015
I think I earned that segue.

29:13.039 --> 29:15.131
I saw him last month... he's fine.

29:15.155 --> 29:18.029
Good for him. So...

29:20.011 --> 29:22.555
how long have you been
sleeping with my daughter?

29:23.814 --> 29:24.908
Mother.

29:26.495 --> 29:30.051
We're all adults here.
Two of us are even doctors.

29:35.077 --> 29:38.484
Well, we've been sleeping
together for a few months,

29:38.508 --> 29:42.513
and before you ask, yes,
we are using protection.

29:42.537 --> 29:44.677
How'd you know I was gonna ask that?

29:44.701 --> 29:45.701
Because...

29:46.013 --> 29:48.790
you said that Jeanne told
you everything about me.

29:49.890 --> 29:50.890
And so...

29:51.578 --> 29:53.247
you know that I'm...

29:54.742 --> 29:56.128
A player?

29:57.459 --> 30:00.377
Actually, I was gonna
say "new at commitment".

30:00.802 --> 30:03.934
But as her mother,
naturally you're concerned

30:03.958 --> 30:05.885
that your daughter's
being taken advantage of.

30:05.909 --> 30:08.402
Oh, I know you're not
taking advantage of her.

30:08.426 --> 30:09.901
And how do you know that?

30:10.376 --> 30:11.848
The way you look at her.

30:12.327 --> 30:16.135
Love doesn't show up on an X-ray,
but I do recognize it when I see it.

30:16.827 --> 30:18.438
And still you worry about me.

30:18.952 --> 30:21.450
A leopard doesn't change
its spots overnight.

30:22.152 --> 30:24.931
And I can see the doubt in
your eyes. Even you're wondering

30:24.955 --> 30:28.179
- how long this is gonna last.
- Ok, I think it's time for another segue.

30:28.203 --> 30:30.703
I made the same mistake
with Jeanne's father.

30:31.331 --> 30:34.158
Mom... Tony is not Dad.

30:34.955 --> 30:38.235
And I don't want to see
her hurt the way that I was.

30:41.245 --> 30:42.269
'Kay?

30:44.308 --> 30:46.745
Could've used one of these last night.

30:46.769 --> 30:49.435
- Dinner went well?
- Barely got out of there alive.

30:49.871 --> 30:53.619
Hopefully, we all do. This Jones
guy's got a pretty serious record.

30:53.892 --> 30:56.433
Besides being Grenouille's
American distributor,

30:56.457 --> 30:59.246
we've got suspected murder,
aggravated assault...

30:59.270 --> 31:03.254
Don't forget assault with a deadly
weapon, arson and kidnapping.

31:03.582 --> 31:05.559
He's not going down without a fight.

31:05.583 --> 31:07.465
He did not look so tough to me.

31:07.621 --> 31:10.284
- Suspect is on-site, alone.
- Armed?

31:10.484 --> 31:11.918
There was. I took care of it.

31:11.942 --> 31:14.222
You two take the back.
McGee, you're with me.

31:16.301 --> 31:20.117
Just make sure Jones can still
talk after he's taken care of.

31:20.141 --> 31:22.239
To get extradition, we need an actual

31:22.263 --> 31:25.208
confession that La
Grenouille ordered the hit.

31:25.232 --> 31:26.395
Copy that.

31:38.646 --> 31:39.747
Not so tough.

31:39.771 --> 31:42.248
The bigger they are, the
louder they fall, McGee.

31:42.272 --> 31:44.030
The harder, Ziva.

31:48.960 --> 31:50.208
Get ready to move.

31:52.019 --> 31:53.053
Move. Now.

31:54.397 --> 31:56.024
- Freeze.
- Federal agents.

32:00.274 --> 32:02.625
La Grenouille told you where to find me?

32:03.172 --> 32:04.333
I said freeze.

32:05.021 --> 32:08.275
You try to do a guy a favor,
and this is how he repays you.

32:08.299 --> 32:09.610
Get down on the ground.

32:10.306 --> 32:11.286
Stop!

32:11.310 --> 32:12.854
Hold your fire.

32:15.336 --> 32:16.336
Hold it!

32:28.740 --> 32:29.720
Don't do it!

32:29.744 --> 32:31.530
I need him alive.

32:37.972 --> 32:39.369
Tango Eight... sitrep!

32:40.963 --> 32:44.405
I repeat, I need your
sitrep, Tango Eight.

32:52.357 --> 32:54.329
We're fine, Director.

32:54.591 --> 32:56.488
Uh, suspect isn't.

33:13.020 --> 33:14.989
Staring's not gonna change anything.

33:16.386 --> 33:17.386
Trust me.

33:19.860 --> 33:24.127
As far as I'm concerned, Andre
Jones got exactly what he deserved.

33:24.511 --> 33:25.788
This isn't about Jones.

33:28.075 --> 33:29.075
You're fishing.

33:29.447 --> 33:31.002
It's not like you, Jethro.

33:34.012 --> 33:36.234
You and me are gonna have a little talk.

33:38.576 --> 33:39.655
Doesn't make sense.

33:39.679 --> 33:42.552
Why does Jones think that
La Grenouille sold him out?

33:42.576 --> 33:44.415
Jones was the last link to The Frog.

33:44.439 --> 33:48.572
With him out of the way, we'd never make a
murder charge against La Grenouille stick.

33:48.596 --> 33:50.724
He tricked us into doing his dirty work.

33:50.748 --> 33:53.194
Ducky says he uses his
sophistication as a weapon.

33:53.218 --> 33:57.177
Even I was unaware of just
how sharp that weapon is.

33:57.201 --> 34:00.113
I just got off the phone
with Troy Webster's physician.

34:00.137 --> 34:02.059
Did you let him know he
missed Webster's cancer?

34:02.083 --> 34:04.885
I did. And I got two
distinct impressions.

34:04.909 --> 34:08.638
One, he was scared. And two,
he was well aware of that tumor.

34:08.661 --> 34:10.554
I mean, how could he have missed it?

34:10.578 --> 34:14.766
Yeah, the good doctor was bribed
to keep it a secret. Or threatened.

34:14.790 --> 34:17.668
La Grenouille worried his employee
health premiums were going to go up?

34:17.693 --> 34:21.973
Being diagnosed with a terminal
illness, Tony, tends to make one

34:21.996 --> 34:24.054
eager to atone for one's sins.

34:24.514 --> 34:27.092
And Grenouille didn't want
Webster atoning for his.

34:27.117 --> 34:29.717
Webster still tried, so he
must have known he was dying.

34:29.741 --> 34:31.427
With that tumor I found?

34:31.451 --> 34:34.833
No, the neurological deficits
would have been pronounced.

34:34.858 --> 34:38.139
He must have suspected
the end was near...

34:38.829 --> 34:41.757
regardless of what any doctor told him.

34:49.081 --> 34:52.601
Normally, when someone says that
they need to have a little talk,

34:52.626 --> 34:54.303
they actually talk.

34:54.668 --> 34:55.962
Director...

34:56.382 --> 34:58.297
of NCIS.

34:59.354 --> 35:00.392
Yes.

35:00.720 --> 35:02.682
That's a job I wouldn't want.

35:02.706 --> 35:04.617
Don't worry, no one's offering.

35:04.641 --> 35:05.618
You know why?

35:05.642 --> 35:10.174
You mean besides your impatience,
total lack of respect for authority

35:10.198 --> 35:12.940
and the fact that you still haven't
learned to play nice with others?

35:12.964 --> 35:15.126
Yeah. Yeah, besides all that?

35:23.109 --> 35:24.350
I already told you,

35:24.374 --> 35:28.161
I am not allowing my personal
feelings to interfere with my job.

35:28.881 --> 35:29.871
Tell me again.

35:29.895 --> 35:33.270
Is there something wrong with wanting
to put an arms dealer out of business?

35:33.443 --> 35:34.464
No.

35:34.771 --> 35:36.495
Is that what you're really after?

35:36.519 --> 35:38.184
What else would I be after?

35:38.208 --> 35:40.495
I don't know, but at
the rate you're going,

35:40.519 --> 35:44.013
the name "Director" is not gonna
be on that door much longer.

35:53.557 --> 35:56.475
It's good to know you're
watching my back, Jethro.

36:02.209 --> 36:03.293
Yeah. Gibbs.

36:07.268 --> 36:08.673
Be right down.

36:09.210 --> 36:13.931
Well, you just may get a chance to put
that arms dealer out of business yet.

36:16.466 --> 36:18.197
You can run, La Grenouille...

36:19.398 --> 36:20.751
but you can't hide.

36:23.724 --> 36:25.031
Or maybe you can.

36:25.055 --> 36:27.617
- What do you got, Abs?
- Oh, your usual incriminating evidence,

36:27.641 --> 36:30.189
all circumstantial, but
beggars can't be choosers.

36:30.213 --> 36:31.962
I'll take what I can get at this point.

36:31.986 --> 36:34.375
McGee asked me to
parse Andre Jones's old

36:34.399 --> 36:37.687
phone and bank records, and
when I did, I saw a pattern.

36:37.711 --> 36:40.099
An encrypted satellite
phone call comes in,

36:40.473 --> 36:43.811
and then a large payment to
an offshore account goes out.

36:43.835 --> 36:45.224
Jones is paying for a shipment.

36:45.248 --> 36:50.281
And then, like Swiss clockwork, 48 hours
later, his GPS signal goes off the grid.

36:50.609 --> 36:53.000
- Picking up the shipment.
- He doesn't want to be followed.

36:53.024 --> 36:55.124
I haven't been able to
trace the satellite call yet,

36:55.148 --> 36:59.087
but I did recognize the
encryption algorithm.

37:02.042 --> 37:04.286
- The Frog.
- It's the same as the one.

37:04.310 --> 37:06.639
La Grenouille's people
used to call Charles Harrow.

37:06.663 --> 37:09.171
- That's a good job, Abby.
- I have a grand finale.

37:09.354 --> 37:13.037
Jones made his last phone
call exactly one day ago.

37:13.142 --> 37:16.332
Which means a shipment is
coming in less than 24 hours.

37:17.009 --> 37:21.235
Ten bucks says that that is
what Troy Webster was planning on

37:21.259 --> 37:23.489
telling us this entire time.

37:27.173 --> 37:28.526
An arms shipment.

37:29.124 --> 37:31.071
What happened to your murder case?

37:31.095 --> 37:34.103
Our key witness didn't
survive his deposition.

37:34.779 --> 37:37.213
Wouldn't have done
you any good if he did.

37:37.596 --> 37:40.623
After our conversation, I made some

37:41.079 --> 37:43.687
interdepartmental inquiries.

37:44.092 --> 37:47.336
Grenouille was not happy to
hear about Webster's murder.

37:47.360 --> 37:49.316
You're saying he didn't authorize it?

37:49.340 --> 37:55.038
I'm saying, Grenouille specifically
spread the word to not touch Webster.

37:55.778 --> 37:57.200
She's pretty fired up.

38:00.217 --> 38:01.661
You know what her beef is?

38:02.465 --> 38:03.465
No.

38:03.840 --> 38:05.451
Would you tell me if you did?

38:08.029 --> 38:10.480
Jones disobeyed La Grenouille.

38:10.736 --> 38:13.668
Didn't care about the orders
to leave Webster alone.

38:14.529 --> 38:17.701
He knew Webster could hurt him as
bad as he could hurt La Grenouille.

38:17.725 --> 38:21.883
That's why Jones thought La
Grenouille had sold him out.

38:22.154 --> 38:24.042
As punishment for killing Webster.

38:24.345 --> 38:27.673
Grenouille must have had
his own plans for Webster.

38:27.780 --> 38:29.816
Sap's probably better off dead.

38:30.218 --> 38:33.495
One thing Grenouille is good
at, it's ruining people's lives.

38:34.892 --> 38:37.445
Okay, tell me this.

38:37.907 --> 38:39.772
Is she hot after all arms dealers,

38:39.796 --> 38:42.196
or is there something about
this one in particular?

38:42.220 --> 38:44.709
You're CIA for now, Tobias. You tell me.

38:44.733 --> 38:46.231
Something about this one.

38:48.596 --> 38:50.651
And you don't know what it is either.

38:50.861 --> 38:52.502
As for your arms shipment,

38:53.532 --> 38:57.390
as far as I know, Grenouille
has no upcoming deliveries.

38:58.284 --> 38:59.339
As far as you know.

38:59.728 --> 39:02.063
Like I said, not my department.

39:04.721 --> 39:05.721
However,

39:06.533 --> 39:09.649
every arms shipment requires
an end-use certificate.

39:10.097 --> 39:11.819
It's a guarantee from the buyer

39:12.051 --> 39:14.422
that the arms won't be resold illegally.

39:14.987 --> 39:17.821
That's why we've had so much
trouble getting to La Grenouille.

39:17.845 --> 39:19.845
His buyers always manage to get one.

39:21.134 --> 39:24.872
All it takes is a third-world
general on the payroll

39:25.345 --> 39:27.122
or an exceptionally good forger.

39:29.846 --> 39:31.735
Which one did Andre Jones have?

39:33.158 --> 39:34.947
Guy looks like an English teacher.

39:34.971 --> 39:36.579
Actually, an art teacher.

39:36.980 --> 39:38.548
You know why you're here.

39:39.347 --> 39:40.347
No.

39:42.660 --> 39:43.826
It wasn't a question.

39:44.659 --> 39:47.103
Do you know how long
you're going to prison?

39:49.535 --> 39:50.646
That was a question.

39:50.871 --> 39:53.182
Get the feeling these
guys have done this before?

39:53.206 --> 39:54.208
Agent Gibbs.

39:54.536 --> 40:00.056
What's the going rate for forging an
EUC certificate for arms smuggling?

40:00.080 --> 40:01.101
20 years.

40:02.064 --> 40:03.086
I'm an art teacher.

40:03.973 --> 40:04.973
Good.

40:06.100 --> 40:07.933
Then you can draw us a picture...

40:08.812 --> 40:10.473
Walked right into that one.

40:12.040 --> 40:16.519
Of the EUC document you
forged for Andre Jones's guns.

40:17.602 --> 40:18.713
And please make sure

40:19.199 --> 40:22.330
that I can read the time
and location of shipment.

40:22.354 --> 40:24.325
It's going down either way.

40:24.349 --> 40:27.327
If you help us, I can put in
a good word with the judge.

40:27.351 --> 40:28.739
And if you don't, then...

40:29.105 --> 40:32.003
I hear Gitmo is lovely
this time of year.

40:32.497 --> 40:33.933
Definitely done this before.

40:33.957 --> 40:35.738
Though you will be wearing a hood.

40:35.762 --> 40:38.474
And that's certainly
going to kill your view.

40:42.290 --> 40:44.593
What kind of good word could
you put in with the judge?

40:44.617 --> 40:47.771
Well, it depends how
good your drawing is.

40:51.976 --> 40:55.694
Yeah, okay. I forged
the EUC for Jones, but

40:55.718 --> 40:57.392
I don't have a location or a date.

40:57.416 --> 40:59.767
- No, not good enough.
- No, he makes me leave it blank.

40:59.791 --> 41:00.952
I swear.

41:00.976 --> 41:03.049
It's added by his shell company.

41:03.852 --> 41:04.977
Name?

41:05.001 --> 41:06.204
Abbot Imports.

41:06.228 --> 41:08.269
- Yeah, you got an address?
- Still working on it.

41:08.293 --> 41:10.274
- What's the problem?
- Problem is, it doesn't exist.

41:10.298 --> 41:11.715
There's no federal tax I.D.

41:11.739 --> 41:14.365
- Mail goes to a P.O. box.
- The number's a payphone.

41:14.389 --> 41:15.964
Who owns the box?

41:16.894 --> 41:19.331
Bills are paid by Andre Jones.

41:19.355 --> 41:21.191
I'm really starting to
wish we didn't kill him.

41:21.215 --> 41:22.582
McGee, did you try Customs?

41:22.606 --> 41:24.616
- Trying now.
- There has to be some record

41:24.640 --> 41:26.722
of his imports, even if it
is through a shell company.

41:26.746 --> 41:28.080
Oh, there is.

41:28.481 --> 41:30.792
Next shipment is
scheduled to arrive today.

41:30.816 --> 41:33.329
- Norfolk Port Authority.
- Got the container number.

41:37.295 --> 41:39.269
Ever seen anyone walk
that quickly in heels?

41:39.293 --> 41:41.083
Only at the end of a really hairy date.

41:41.107 --> 41:43.076
Import company missed the pickup.

41:43.100 --> 41:45.718
No one claims the container
within the next 12 hours,

41:45.783 --> 41:47.258
orders are "return it to sender".

41:47.282 --> 41:49.299
Lucks yours guys called when you did.

41:49.479 --> 41:51.664
Luck had very little to do with it.

41:52.120 --> 41:55.244
I really hope the Director
relaxes a bit after this.

41:55.981 --> 41:58.278
- Don't get your hopes up, McGee.
- Why?

41:58.302 --> 41:59.992
Once we get the weapons
and trace them back

42:00.016 --> 42:01.506
to La Grenouille, he'll go underground.

42:01.530 --> 42:03.532
Interpol will issue a red notice.

42:03.556 --> 42:05.771
But it'll still be up to us to find him.

42:05.795 --> 42:07.327
So, in other words...

42:07.351 --> 42:09.975
- There.
- Cancel your dinner plans, Probie.

42:09.999 --> 42:11.954
- Open it.
- Yes, ma'am.

42:24.116 --> 42:26.049
I got you.

42:49.339 --> 42:50.707
Squirt guns.

42:57.924 --> 43:01.615
"Dear Webster, best
wishes on your new career.

43:02.468 --> 43:03.909
La Grenouille".

43:07.441 --> 43:09.028
We have nothing.

43:09.672 --> 43:10.672
We never did.

43:18.485 --> 43:19.485
He's good.

43:20.173 --> 43:21.566
He's really good.

43:22.036 --> 43:23.787
He'd better be.
