WEBVTT

00:00.301 --> 00:01.701
Ty: Previously on "Heartland":

00:01.768 --> 00:04.503
Dad, you can see that
he's getting better, right?

00:04.571 --> 00:05.571
These things take Tim.

00:05.638 --> 00:07.339
Yeah, except time is money

00:07.407 --> 00:09.007
and I'm runnin' out of both.

00:09.075 --> 00:10.909
I think we're done.
I can't do this.

00:10.976 --> 00:12.444
I can't do this.

00:12.512 --> 00:14.279
Maybe we are.

00:14.347 --> 00:16.248
There's no maybes.

00:16.315 --> 00:17.616
Where are you gonna stay?

00:17.684 --> 00:19.417
(Sighs) I don't know.

00:20.519 --> 00:22.220
Hey, babe, Ty's gonna be
staying with us

00:22.287 --> 00:23.487
for a couple of days.

00:23.555 --> 00:24.722
You don't mind
do you, hon?

00:25.824 --> 00:28.526
It turns out you guys
are right on track;

00:29.461 --> 00:30.595
I'm pregnant.

00:37.702 --> 00:40.403
You're a good boy, Dexter.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:49.980 --> 00:51.214
(Hooves thump)

00:58.154 --> 00:59.221
Hey!

01:00.357 --> 01:03.024
Did you forget something?

01:04.727 --> 01:06.194
Ty:
Morning. Ugh.

01:08.864 --> 01:09.897
Hey.

01:09.965 --> 01:11.866
Caleb:
Hey, buddy.

01:11.933 --> 01:13.134
Kind of thought you'd be
at school by now.

01:13.201 --> 01:15.236
Nah.
I'm studying here today.

01:15.304 --> 01:16.771
I got a big bio test tomorrow,

01:16.838 --> 01:18.640
so I got like 7 chapters worth
of sample questions

01:18.707 --> 01:19.674
to go through.

01:19.742 --> 01:22.009
Yeah?
Well, I got one for ya.

01:22.077 --> 01:23.644
What's got two thumbs
and the day off?

01:25.647 --> 01:26.747
This guy.

01:26.814 --> 01:29.483
Um... I don't thinks so,
cowboy.

01:29.550 --> 01:31.318
This place is a disaster.

01:31.386 --> 01:32.653
The cleaning products
are under the sink

01:32.720 --> 01:34.588
and I need you to do
the laundry.

01:34.656 --> 01:35.855
Sure that's all?

01:35.923 --> 01:39.759
Well, you could get
a head start on dinner.

01:39.826 --> 01:41.494
Love you.
Bye.

01:41.561 --> 01:42.662
Bye bye.

01:43.863 --> 01:44.930
(Laughing)

01:49.202 --> 01:50.569
(Truck rumbles)

01:55.808 --> 01:57.241
What's this?

01:57.310 --> 01:58.843
S s this part
of his rehabilitation?

01:58.911 --> 02:00.111
Did you see him?
He's great!

02:00.179 --> 02:01.746
He is a natural jumper.

02:01.814 --> 02:03.080
He's a racehorse;

02:03.148 --> 02:04.382
you should be working him
at the track.

02:04.450 --> 02:05.883
Dad, I just...
I...

02:06.652 --> 02:08.953
I don't know if his tendons
can handle the stress of that.

02:10.789 --> 02:12.022
Listen, I've been patient here.

02:12.089 --> 02:13.657
How long is this going to take?

02:13.725 --> 02:18.094
I don't know.
Um, maybe never.

02:18.162 --> 02:20.364
Amy, be positive, okay?

02:20.432 --> 02:22.032
I know you're nursing
a broken heart and all,

02:22.099 --> 02:23.266
but I'm telling you...

02:23.335 --> 02:25.235
That has nothing
to do with this, okay?

02:25.303 --> 02:26.303
I just...

02:26.371 --> 02:27.637
I think I can retrain him.

02:27.705 --> 02:29.238
To do what?
Show jump?

02:29.306 --> 02:30.707
How's that better
for his tendons?

02:30.774 --> 02:32.342
Well, he could be
a hunter jumper.

02:32.409 --> 02:33.443
The jumps are lower

02:33.510 --> 02:35.177
and it's all about form
and style.

02:35.245 --> 02:37.313
You saw him,
he could do really well.

02:37.381 --> 02:39.849
I'm not in this to win ribbons;

02:39.916 --> 02:42.518
I'm in this to make money.

02:42.586 --> 02:44.118
I want you to get him
back in the track.

02:44.186 --> 02:46.254
Janice is coming
to give him a test ride.

02:56.432 --> 02:59.433
You can't be serious, man.

02:59.501 --> 03:02.370
We're out of clean dishes.

03:02.437 --> 03:04.638
Watch it, man!
What are...

03:04.706 --> 03:07.441
I gonna re-sell
this text book. Agh!

03:07.509 --> 03:10.544
It's just a little speck
of sauce.

03:10.612 --> 03:12.546
What's eating you?

03:13.448 --> 03:15.282
I can't concentrate right now.

03:15.350 --> 03:16.416
Duh.

03:16.517 --> 03:18.951
I mean, your girlfriend
just dumped y

03:19.019 --> 03:20.253
well, you should be
letting loose,

03:20.320 --> 03:22.955
not stressing about
some silly exam.

03:23.023 --> 03:24.957
I don't really have
a choice, do I?

03:25.025 --> 03:27.394
You know what you need Ty?

03:27.461 --> 03:28.661
You need a brain break.

03:28.729 --> 03:30.029
You should hang out
with me today.

03:30.097 --> 03:31.497
Yeah, that would do it.

03:31.564 --> 03:32.898
Dude, I'm serious.

03:32.965 --> 03:34.767
Let's he e some fun.

03:34.834 --> 03:35.967
Come on.

03:36.903 --> 03:37.969
Eh?

03:38.905 --> 03:41.507
(Hooves thud heavily)

03:41.574 --> 03:43.174
Tim: Come on, let it out!

03:51.384 --> 03:54.152
So what's wrong with him?
He was crawling out there.

03:54.220 --> 03:55.954
I don't know,
I tried everything.

03:56.022 --> 03:56.988
Is it his tendon?

03:57.056 --> 03:58.023
I don't know about his leg,

03:58.090 --> 04:00.858
but his heart isn't in it
any more.

04:01.794 --> 04:03.228
You should cut your losses.

04:03.296 --> 04:05.695
I think it might be time for you
to sell this horse.

Hey, there she is!

04:59.014 --> 05:00.781
Whoa!

05:00.849 --> 05:02.850
Aren't you supposed
to be taking it easy?

05:02.917 --> 05:06.587
I can't help it.
My husband just came home.

05:07.856 --> 05:09.022
(Laughs)

05:09.123 --> 05:10.123
Okay, but you're kind
of squeezing me

05:10.191 --> 05:12.492
oh! I'm sorry.
You okay?

05:12.559 --> 05:13.659
Is the baby okay?

05:13.727 --> 05:14.894
Absolutely.

05:14.962 --> 05:17.030
Oh! I felt I kick.

05:17.965 --> 05:19.199
Too soon.

05:19.266 --> 05:21.567
Probably just what I had
for breakfast.

05:21.635 --> 05:22.768
(Laughing)

05:23.770 --> 05:24.970
Well, I gotta make sure
that I am here

05:25.038 --> 05:26.605
when it does happen.

05:26.672 --> 05:27.973
What is that supposed to mean?

05:28.041 --> 05:29.975
I'm not going back to Dubai.

05:30.043 --> 05:32.044
I'm gonna stay here,
make this home base.

05:32.112 --> 05:34.246
You're gonna work from here?

05:34.314 --> 05:37.983
Yeah, until the end
of the pregnancy anyway.

05:38.051 --> 05:40.084
Just until the pregnancy
is over?

05:40.152 --> 05:41.585
Well, I...

05:41.653 --> 05:42.953
Maybe I can stick around

05:43.022 --> 05:44.255
until we send him
to college or something.

05:46.758 --> 05:48.159
(Elated laugh)

05:48.760 --> 05:52.096
You know, I can't believe
Janice would even go there.

05:52.164 --> 05:54.365
Well, it's not that crazy.

05:54.433 --> 05:56.199
I mean, Dexter's best days
are behind him,

05:56.267 --> 05:57.901
dad...
You said so yourself.

05:57.968 --> 05:59.036
Yeah.

06:00.804 --> 06:04.341
There's a claiming race
coming up.

06:04.409 --> 06:05.675
I'm just thinking about it.

06:05.743 --> 06:06.276
We might as well make
some money off him

06:06.344 --> 06:07.511
while we can.

06:07.578 --> 06:08.711
Where's Dexter?

06:08.779 --> 06:10.313
He's still at the track.

06:10.381 --> 06:12.448
Dad's thinking of entering him
in a claiming race.

06:12.516 --> 06:13.749
What's a claiming race?

06:13.816 --> 06:15.317
I'm thinking about it.

06:15.385 --> 06:18.354
It's where all the horses
that run are up for sale.

06:18.422 --> 06:21.023
Mallory: Really?
So anyone could just buy him?

06:21.091 --> 06:22.191
How would you know
where he'd end up?

06:22.259 --> 06:23.526
Seems kinda scary.

06:23.593 --> 06:25.494
Yeah. Exactly.

06:25.562 --> 06:27.963
I haven't decided yet.

06:29.731 --> 06:31.499
Do you ever mind
your own business?

06:36.272 --> 06:37.672
Jack:
Well, I've gotta say,

06:37.739 --> 06:41.376
we are all pretty darn excited
about the news.

06:41.444 --> 06:43.178
You know, I can't believe
I'm going to be an aunt.

06:43.245 --> 06:45.212
Lou: I can't believe
I'm going to be a mom!

06:45.280 --> 06:46.513
Mallory: And I can't believe
I'm going to be a...

06:46.581 --> 06:47.881
Amy and Lou:
Babysitter.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.183
(Laughs)

06:49.250 --> 06:51.251
Mallory: Ha ha ha!
Laugh it up, gramps.

06:51.319 --> 06:52.553
(Coughs)

06:52.620 --> 06:55.255
Well, actually,
I can't wait to be...

06:55.323 --> 06:57.023
One of those.

06:57.092 --> 06:59.859
Peter: Yeah. Me and my grandpa
Morris had a real special bond.

06:59.927 --> 07:02.695
He was an arm wrestling champ
back in the day.

07:02.762 --> 07:04.263
He used to tell me stories
all the time

07:04.331 --> 07:07.833
about beating guys named "ox"
or like "night train."

07:07.901 --> 07:09.602
I used to ride a bronc
named night train.

07:09.669 --> 07:10.869
Peter: See?
There you go, that's awesome.

07:10.937 --> 07:12.771
You can tell your grandkids
stories

07:12.839 --> 07:14.873
about your glory days
in the rodeo.

07:14.941 --> 07:18.310
No, I think I'll save that
for the great grandpa.

07:18.377 --> 07:19.311
(All laugh)

07:19.378 --> 07:21.379
That suits me just fine.

07:21.447 --> 07:23.548
I got better stories anyway.

07:23.616 --> 07:25.584
Lou:
So, uh, grampa...

07:26.519 --> 07:28.453
Sorry, grampa Jack.

07:29.355 --> 07:31.289
Uh, Peter and I where talking

07:31.357 --> 07:33.657
and don't you think
the guest room

07:33.725 --> 07:35.559
would make the perfect nursery?

07:35.627 --> 07:37.361
What? Marion's room?

07:38.263 --> 07:40.364
Well, no.
Actually, I don't.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.334
Why?

07:43.401 --> 07:45.202
Lots of reasons.

07:45.270 --> 07:46.303
Like?

07:48.839 --> 07:49.905
C'mon, grampa.

07:49.973 --> 07:51.207
How about
I just don't want to;

07:51.275 --> 07:53.376
I like it the way it is.

07:59.149 --> 08:00.282
(Music plays)

08:06.322 --> 08:07.556
Yes!

08:07.624 --> 08:09.458
Damn!

08:09.526 --> 08:10.925
Nice work, buddy.

08:10.993 --> 08:12.093
Pay up, boys!

08:13.895 --> 08:16.531
Oh! That hurts,
doesn't it?

08:16.598 --> 08:17.931
Hey, Colby, look!

08:17.999 --> 08:19.933
Ha ha! Last Saturday night
in high river.

08:20.001 --> 08:22.336
Oh man, we were on fire!

08:23.272 --> 08:26.106
Caleb: You know, for two of the
best outriders on the circuit,

08:26.175 --> 08:27.241
your pool game sucks.

08:27.309 --> 08:28.576
Colby:
Hey, hey, hey.

08:28.644 --> 08:30.310
We're just getting
warmed up here.

08:30.378 --> 08:32.010
How 'bout another
go around, huh?

08:32.078 --> 08:33.313
Losers rack 'em.

08:33.381 --> 08:34.414
Ty: Actually, I gotta go, guys.

08:34.482 --> 08:35.715
What?

08:35.783 --> 08:37.850
No, man. Look your test
isn't until tomorrow.

08:37.918 --> 08:38.885
Study tonight.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.019
Lance:
Tell you what.

08:40.087 --> 08:41.154
We'll raise the stakes
a little.

08:41.222 --> 08:43.190
Make it worth your while.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.457
Caleb:
Come on, man,

08:44.525 --> 08:45.991
I can really use the cash
right now.

08:46.059 --> 08:47.593
Ashley wants me to pay off
the credit card debt

08:47.661 --> 08:48.694
before the wedding.

08:48.761 --> 08:49.728
What, so you can
Max it out again?

08:49.796 --> 08:51.797
Caleb:
Whatever.

08:51.864 --> 08:53.399
All right, one more game.

08:53.466 --> 08:54.533
Atta boy.

08:59.105 --> 09:01.206
You girls are going down.

09:03.842 --> 09:05.776
Janice: See?
It's the one I told you about.

09:09.748 --> 09:12.283
So, what do you think
of this guy?

09:12.351 --> 09:14.118
Burning inferno.

09:14.186 --> 09:15.220
Janice: Yeah, he's in a
claiming race this weekend.

09:15.287 --> 09:17.821
Tim:
Yeah. He looks good.

09:17.888 --> 09:20.557
I don't have spare cash
to throw on another horse.

09:20.625 --> 09:23.093
Well, you will once
we unload Dexter.

09:23.160 --> 09:24.428
Come on, Tim,

09:24.495 --> 09:26.796
it's time to take this thing
to the next level.

09:26.864 --> 09:29.266
Unless this racing thing
is more of a hobby to you.

09:29.334 --> 09:30.567
A hobby?

09:30.635 --> 09:32.469
Yeah, you know, something
to keep you occupied

09:32.537 --> 09:33.902
in your retirement years...

09:33.970 --> 09:37.873
Between bouncing grandkids
on your lap.

09:37.941 --> 09:39.942
I don't know.
I gotta think about it.

09:40.009 --> 09:41.510
Just remember,
it's important to know

09:41.578 --> 09:44.547
when to put an old horse
out to pasture.

09:44.615 --> 09:46.982
Believe me, it's something
I think about.

09:53.956 --> 09:55.056
(Chuckles)

10:03.566 --> 10:04.633
(Logs crumble)

10:05.533 --> 10:06.867
I told you,
you gotta keep looking,

10:06.934 --> 10:08.201
make sure it's not leaning.

10:08.270 --> 10:09.670
Looked straight to ..

10:09.738 --> 10:12.573
Well, then you better
get your eyes checked.

10:12.641 --> 10:13.840
Ty was the wood pile guy.

10:13.908 --> 10:15.576
It really sucks
that he's not here.

10:15.644 --> 10:18.178
Well, make sure you criss-cross
those pieces at the end.

10:18.246 --> 10:20.947
And, thanks to you,
I'm grounded for life!

10:21.015 --> 10:23.616
Make sure it stays straight
and square...

10:23.684 --> 10:24.917
That's the key.

10:24.985 --> 10:27.019
And now Lou is turning
Marion's room,

10:27.087 --> 10:29.622
which is my room,
into a nursery!

10:29.690 --> 10:32.024
Just another example
of what an afterthought

10:32.092 --> 10:33.493
I am to this family.

10:33.560 --> 10:35.227
Yeah, well, you better get
your hearing checked too.

10:35.296 --> 10:36.696
You were there.

10:36.764 --> 10:38.664
I told her we're not doing
anything with that room.

10:38.731 --> 10:41.433
Oh, please!
Lou will get her way.

10:43.202 --> 10:46.037
Ow! Sliver.

10:46.105 --> 10:47.138
This sucks!

10:47.206 --> 10:49.775
Somebody invented gloves once.

10:53.345 --> 10:54.712
Arggghh.

10:54.780 --> 10:58.182
Okay. Ash's gonna be
at least fifteen minutes so...

10:58.249 --> 11:01.084
I'll get dinner going,
you attack the dishes.

11:01.152 --> 11:02.085
Look, man, I'm really sorry,

11:02.153 --> 11:03.587
but I gotta study now.

11:03.655 --> 11:05.189
Look, I know the afternoon
kinda got away from us,

11:05.256 --> 11:07.792
but we were just on
such a roll.

11:07.859 --> 11:09.226
I'm sure Ashley will
cut you some slack

11:09.294 --> 11:10.860
when she finds out
how much money you won.

11:10.928 --> 11:12.595
Uh, no, you keep that
under your hat, Ty.

11:12.630 --> 11:13.630
Ashley, doesn't like me

11:13.731 --> 11:15.198
hanging out at the pool hall.

11:15.265 --> 11:16.899
Just please help me
get this cleaned up.

11:16.967 --> 11:19.235
Ashley is gonna freak
if she sees this.

11:19.303 --> 11:20.704
All right.
Okay.

11:20.771 --> 11:22.405
Caleb: Thank you.
Ty: Throw me a rag or something.

11:22.473 --> 11:24.307
Here, use this.

11:25.275 --> 11:26.642
Are you kidding, man?

11:26.710 --> 11:28.657
Don't worry, man.
I only wore them once.

11:34.183 --> 11:37.185
Hey, honey,
you're home early.

11:38.788 --> 11:40.756
Lou: Grampa drives
me crazy sometimes.

11:40.824 --> 11:42.790
It's like, God forbid
we should ever change

11:42.858 --> 11:44.492
anything in this house.

11:44.560 --> 11:46.227
It's like living in a museum.

11:46.294 --> 11:47.662
Well, it is his house.

11:47.730 --> 11:51.298
I know, but how great
would this be?

11:53.134 --> 11:55.062
Yeah.
It looks great, Lou,

11:55.182 --> 11:57.571
but Jack doesn't want us in there.
We should drop it.

11:57.672 --> 12:00.273
And where's the baby
supposed to sleep?

12:00.341 --> 12:02.089
We've still got my condo.

12:02.209 --> 12:04.911
Your old bachelor pad?
I don't think so.

12:04.979 --> 12:07.313
I know it's not ideal, but...

12:08.315 --> 12:10.316
Well I'll figure something out.

12:11.252 --> 12:12.719
Okay.

12:12.787 --> 12:15.087
Oh, please don't eat that.
I'm about to start dinner.

12:15.154 --> 12:16.538
Well, I'm just gonna have a quick snack.

12:16.658 --> 12:18.357
And then go to bed anyway.
So...

12:18.425 --> 12:20.940
What?
It's five o'clock.

12:21.060 --> 12:23.447
Yeah, and I start work
at eleven tonight,

12:23.567 --> 12:25.398
which is nine in the morning
Dubai time.

12:25.465 --> 12:27.082
Oh, right.

12:28.535 --> 12:29.601
Right. (Sighs)

12:32.405 --> 12:34.105
Amy:
So how's University?

12:34.206 --> 12:36.441
Soraya: Uh, well, between that
and this place,

12:36.509 --> 12:38.142
and the dude ranch,
I'm a little stressed.

12:38.210 --> 12:40.044
But  I'm surviving.

12:40.112 --> 12:41.479
How are you?

12:41.547 --> 12:42.680
I'm good.

12:43.616 --> 12:45.649
You talked to Ty?

12:45.717 --> 12:46.950
No.

12:47.018 --> 12:47.984
I'm sorry.

12:48.052 --> 12:49.119
It's okay.

12:50.254 --> 12:52.088
So how's he doing at school?

12:52.189 --> 12:55.025
Well, I haven't seen
much of him on campus.

12:55.092 --> 12:57.227
Actually, I haven't seen him
at all in the past few weeks.

12:57.295 --> 12:58.495
You think he's skippin' out?

12:58.563 --> 12:59.930
No, I just...

12:59.997 --> 13:01.231
Think we have really different
class schedules.

13:01.299 --> 13:02.899
Don't worry about it.

13:02.966 --> 13:04.166
Okay.

13:04.234 --> 13:05.067
I'm fine though.

13:05.135 --> 13:07.236
Like really, I'm just...

13:08.439 --> 13:10.873
I've been worried about Dexter.

13:10.941 --> 13:12.374
My dad's thinking
of getting rid of him

13:12.443 --> 13:13.810
in a claiming race.

13:13.877 --> 13:15.945
What?
You love that horse.

13:16.012 --> 13:17.813
Yeah.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.681
Well, um...

13:19.749 --> 13:21.015
Listen, I get off
in a few minutes.

13:21.951 --> 13:23.485
Wanna come hang out with us?

13:23.553 --> 13:24.886
Us?

13:24.954 --> 13:27.388
Chase is coming to meet me.

13:27.457 --> 13:29.591
You know, I think I'm gonna
take a rain check,

13:29.659 --> 13:31.593
but thank you for the offer.

13:31.661 --> 13:33.227
Okay.
See ya.

13:39.267 --> 13:40.668
Hey, Jack?

13:40.735 --> 13:41.669
Geez, I didn't wake you, did I?

13:41.736 --> 13:43.003
Oh no. No.

13:43.071 --> 13:44.839
When you get my age,
you sleep lightly.

13:44.906 --> 13:46.640
You're working pretty late.

13:46.708 --> 13:50.510
Yeah, I'm still on
Dubai time here, you know?

13:50.578 --> 13:51.778
You know, it's funny,

13:51.846 --> 13:52.679
Lou and I are finally
in the same place

13:52.746 --> 13:54.547
and we're time zones apart.

13:54.615 --> 13:56.616
Yeah. Well, at least
you're under the same roof.

13:56.684 --> 13:58.485
Yeah. Yeah.

13:58.552 --> 14:00.487
And it is great to be here.

14:01.455 --> 14:02.856
Listen, Peter, I...

14:04.124 --> 14:06.725
I just wanna let you know that,

14:06.793 --> 14:08.660
you know,
about this guest room,

14:08.728 --> 14:10.295
I know that's
what we use it for,

14:10.363 --> 14:13.098
but to me
it's still Marion's room.

14:13.165 --> 14:14.967
Oh hey... yeah.

14:15.034 --> 14:16.935
Believe me,
I totally get it, Jack.

14:17.003 --> 14:18.604
Absolutely.

14:18.671 --> 14:21.006
Listen, I just wanted
to mention,

14:21.073 --> 14:22.974
I really appreciate everything
you're doing for us here,

14:23.041 --> 14:24.241
you know?

14:24.309 --> 14:26.443
No, it means a lot, it does.

14:26.512 --> 14:27.745
This ranch is the closest thing

14:27.813 --> 14:29.213
we've got to a home right now,
so...

15:10.372 --> 15:11.473
Tim:
Hey, kid.

15:11.540 --> 15:12.773
You're out here workin' early.

15:12.841 --> 15:15.309
Yeah, well, I just wanted
to take Dexter for a run.

15:15.376 --> 15:18.512
See if what Janice says
is really true.

15:18.580 --> 15:22.182
So, uh, about the claiming race
this weekend...

15:22.250 --> 15:24.318
You're not really gonna
enter him, are you?

15:24.385 --> 15:25.452
Yeah, I am.

15:27.021 --> 15:29.723
It was a tough decision,

15:29.790 --> 15:31.457
but it's the smart way to go.

15:31.525 --> 15:34.193
Yeah, maybe for you and Janice.

15:35.395 --> 15:37.530
You know, I just...
I don't get you two!

15:37.598 --> 15:38.664
I don't.

15:40.734 --> 15:41.834
Amy, come on.

15:45.139 --> 15:47.506
Oh my God, I'm gonna be late
for my fitting.

15:47.573 --> 15:48.773
I think my mom
has made me try on

15:48.841 --> 15:51.443
every wedding dress in Alberta,

15:51.511 --> 15:53.411
but I finally found
the perfect one.

15:53.479 --> 15:54.613
I can't wait to see it.

15:54.680 --> 15:56.281
Well, you're going to have to.

15:56.349 --> 15:57.582
Have a nice day.

15:57.650 --> 15:58.883
Bye, sweetie.

15:58.951 --> 16:00.018
Ashley:
Bye.

16:01.154 --> 16:02.920
Okay.
I don't get it, man.

16:02.988 --> 16:04.555
Last night she made you
sleep outside.

16:04.623 --> 16:05.889
And today it's all about
the wedding,

16:05.957 --> 16:07.625
like nothing happened.

16:07.692 --> 16:08.892
Ashley and I,

16:08.960 --> 16:10.394
we both tend to run
a little hot...

16:10.462 --> 16:13.764
And sometimes that's good,
sometimes not so much.

16:13.831 --> 16:14.965
So we made a pact.

16:15.900 --> 16:17.368
No matter how big
a fight we have,

16:17.435 --> 16:20.102
when we wake up in the morning
we kiss and make up.

16:20.171 --> 16:21.737
It's kinda like having
a reset button.

16:21.805 --> 16:23.005
Until the next fight.

16:23.073 --> 16:24.940
Exactly.

16:25.008 --> 16:26.376
'Kay, I gotta get a move on.

16:26.443 --> 16:29.279
Jack is gonna kill me
if I'm late.

16:29.346 --> 16:30.980
Yeah, and there's no
reset button with him.

16:31.048 --> 16:32.982
No...No there's not.

16:33.917 --> 16:35.117
You ready for the test?

16:35.185 --> 16:36.785
No.

16:36.852 --> 16:38.453
It's multiple choice.

16:38.521 --> 16:40.121
Bound to get some of them
right.

16:40.190 --> 16:41.256
See you later.

16:48.731 --> 16:49.798
(Buttons beep)

16:51.833 --> 16:52.966
(Phone rings)

16:57.206 --> 16:58.906
Amy: Hey, this is Amy.
I'm not here right now,

16:58.973 --> 17:01.709
so leave a message.
(Beep)

17:07.548 --> 17:08.582
Oh! (Laughs)

17:10.084 --> 17:11.518
Lance:
Oh, look who's back.

17:11.586 --> 17:13.286
Hope you brought your wallet.

17:13.354 --> 17:14.588
Of course.

17:14.655 --> 17:16.155
How else am I gonna bring home
all your money?

17:16.223 --> 17:17.890
Oh! Well, me 'n' Colby
only play doubles.

17:17.958 --> 17:19.925
So you're gonna need a partner.

17:19.992 --> 17:21.560
Well...

17:21.628 --> 17:22.895
Hey!

17:22.963 --> 17:25.797
You, with the fancy shirt,
you play?

17:28.201 --> 17:29.268
Sure do.

17:33.406 --> 17:35.107
Ashley: Okay, so I need
three steak sandwiches:

17:35.174 --> 17:36.442
One with fries,
one with coleslaw,

17:36.509 --> 17:37.943
one with fries and coleslaw;

17:38.010 --> 17:40.811
two cheese burgers -
mustard, onions and pickles,

17:40.879 --> 17:41.812
and one with all the works.

17:41.880 --> 17:44.215
Oh, and light on the mayo.

17:44.283 --> 17:45.650
I don't know how you keep
everything so straight

17:45.718 --> 17:48.018
when it gets this busy.

17:48.086 --> 17:49.254
Well, there were a lot
of screw-ups

17:49.321 --> 17:50.488
and broken dishes,

17:50.556 --> 17:52.657
but after a week
you get the hang of it.

17:52.725 --> 17:53.691
And I like it when it's busy

17:53.759 --> 17:56.059
'cause the day flies by.

17:56.127 --> 17:58.595
Okay, this might be
totally inappropriate,

17:58.663 --> 18:00.430
but how much do you make?

18:01.366 --> 18:03.032
Minimum wage.

18:03.100 --> 18:04.968
But then there's tips.

18:05.035 --> 18:08.037
Right. So how much would
a cowboy or a rancher tip?

18:08.105 --> 18:11.574
Well, depends how much
you smile.

18:19.082 --> 18:20.416
Amy:
Hey, Caleb.

18:21.551 --> 18:24.052
Um, look,
I've just gotta ask...

18:24.120 --> 18:26.955
How are things going
at the trailer?

18:27.023 --> 18:28.256
He's okay.

18:28.324 --> 18:29.424
Oh.

18:29.492 --> 18:31.593
But I mean, not good.

18:32.561 --> 18:33.928
You know, not himself.

18:33.996 --> 18:34.929
Really?

18:34.997 --> 18:36.564
Yeah.

18:36.632 --> 18:37.799
You know, I've tried talking
to him about you guys,

18:37.866 --> 18:40.234
but he wasn't having that.

18:41.170 --> 18:43.204
So we've mostly been
hanging out,

18:43.272 --> 18:45.071
playing pool,
that sort of thing.

18:45.139 --> 18:47.140
Playing pool, huh?

18:47.208 --> 18:49.343
Is that why he's been
skipping class?

18:49.411 --> 18:51.445
(Chuckles and sighs)

18:56.150 --> 18:58.819
Ty: I'm going to cut the eight
ball into the side pocket.

18:58.886 --> 19:02.322
I'd go with the bank shot,
corner pocket.

19:02.389 --> 19:03.923
Thanks for your advice,

19:03.990 --> 19:05.991
but if you haven't noticed
I've sunk most of our balls.

19:06.059 --> 19:09.195
Yeah, but the eight ball's
kinda like a good woman

19:09.262 --> 19:10.530
on the pool table of life;

19:10.597 --> 19:12.398
it's the only one
that really counts.

19:12.466 --> 19:14.734
You screw that up,
who cares about the rest?

19:21.474 --> 19:22.574
Shoulda gone with
the bank shot.

19:22.642 --> 19:24.075
Lance:
Colby, you're up.

19:24.143 --> 19:26.044
Colby:
Okay. All right. Bye.

19:26.979 --> 19:28.447
That was the boss.

19:28.514 --> 19:30.181
He's all hot on some horse
in the claiming race.

19:30.249 --> 19:32.149
Hurricane Dexter
or something like that.

19:32.217 --> 19:33.417
Lightning Dexter?

19:33.485 --> 19:34.585
That's it.

19:34.653 --> 19:37.154
Only asking $5000 dollars too.

19:37.222 --> 19:38.689
Ouch.

19:38.757 --> 19:40.858
Dexter's going to end up
pulling a chuck wagon.

19:40.925 --> 19:43.060
Amy's not going to like that.

19:43.127 --> 19:44.061
Hey, I got an idea.

19:44.128 --> 19:45.763
You should put in a claim.

19:45.831 --> 19:47.930
You'd come out looking
like a hero.

19:47.998 --> 19:48.998
Of course, we don't all have

19:49.066 --> 19:51.067
an extra five g's
kicking around.

19:51.134 --> 19:53.670
Six ball, corner pocket.

19:56.407 --> 19:57.807
Agh! Damn!

19:57.875 --> 19:59.876
Bank shot, side pocket.

20:10.820 --> 20:14.122
Lou: Grandpa, there is
something I wanna show you.

20:14.190 --> 20:17.626
Just so you know
what I was thinking, okay?

20:17.694 --> 20:19.261
This is where
the changing table would go,

20:19.328 --> 20:20.795
and that is the crib.

20:20.863 --> 20:22.797
But then, when it's time
for the big kid's bed-

20:22.865 --> 20:24.832
Honey, I thought we were going
to drop this? Didn't we...

20:24.900 --> 20:28.369
It's just that the baby
has got to sleep somewhere.

20:28.437 --> 20:30.070
I mean, I guess we can always
move back to the condo,

20:30.138 --> 20:31.472
like you suggested.

20:31.540 --> 20:32.807
You know, shove the crib
in the en-suite bathroom.

20:32.875 --> 20:34.475
Lou, what're you...

20:34.543 --> 20:36.209
Lou: I'm serious, it would
make potty training a breeze.

20:36.277 --> 20:39.646
I mean, if that's what
grandpa wants.

20:40.548 --> 20:42.382
Amy, what do you think
about all this?

20:42.450 --> 20:44.584
I don't...
(Phone rings)

20:44.652 --> 20:45.552
Hold on.

20:45.620 --> 20:47.186
Saved by the bell.

20:48.489 --> 20:49.790
(Phone rings)

20:50.391 --> 20:53.025
So, you're not even
taking his calls now?

20:54.027 --> 20:55.628
Amy:
I learned from the best.

21:03.703 --> 21:04.804
(Truck rumbles)

21:15.414 --> 21:16.915
Hey.

21:16.982 --> 21:18.049
Hey.

21:19.585 --> 21:22.921
So, uh, Caleb tells me
that Lou is pregnant.

21:22.988 --> 21:24.455
That's pretty crazy!

21:24.522 --> 21:28.258
Yeah, the whole family's
over the moon about it.

21:28.326 --> 21:30.193
Uh, that's great.

21:30.261 --> 21:32.362
I just came by
to get some stuff

21:32.430 --> 21:34.565
out of the loft, so...

21:34.632 --> 21:37.768
Yeah, well... no hurry.
Take your time.

21:40.637 --> 21:43.105
Uh, do you know if Amy's
around or...?

21:43.173 --> 21:45.240
She's in the barn.

21:47.911 --> 21:48.945
Hey...

21:49.913 --> 21:53.015
Just be... you know.

22:14.035 --> 22:16.103
What are you doing here?

22:17.305 --> 22:18.238
How come you're not picking up

22:18.306 --> 22:19.573
or returning my calls?

22:23.612 --> 22:24.645
Look...

22:26.047 --> 22:28.581
I've been thinking...

22:28.649 --> 22:30.182
You know, maybe we let things
get out of hand.

22:30.250 --> 22:32.685
Maybe we should have had
a rule.

22:33.587 --> 22:35.121
A rule?

22:35.188 --> 22:36.856
I don't know, like...

22:38.025 --> 22:41.561
Maybe, no matter
how big the fight,

22:41.629 --> 22:42.829
the next morning
when we wake up,

22:42.897 --> 22:45.497
we just start over.

22:46.733 --> 22:49.501
You know, like hitting
a reset button or somethin'.

22:49.569 --> 22:51.670
Right. So you can just erase
your lies about Blair?

22:53.907 --> 22:56.374
At least I'm not still
talking to Blair.

22:56.442 --> 22:58.109
I'm not talking to Chase.

22:58.177 --> 23:00.011
I avoid him at all costs.

23:00.078 --> 23:01.378
Right.

23:02.080 --> 23:04.916
You know, I feel sorry
for Soraya in all this.

23:04.983 --> 23:06.784
No, you don't get to come here
and turn this around on me.

23:06.852 --> 23:08.485
Look, I just came by
to tell you

23:08.554 --> 23:10.821
that some chuck wagon guy
is putting a claim on Dexter.

23:12.758 --> 23:14.992
All right?
I'm outta here.

23:22.901 --> 23:26.003
Jack: So, you're okay with
Dexter pulling a chuck wagon?

23:26.070 --> 23:27.404
What? Yeah.

23:27.471 --> 23:28.905
At least we got a buyer.

23:28.972 --> 23:30.907
Well, Amy doesn't think
his tendons will hold up

23:30.974 --> 23:32.975
to that kind of punishment.

23:33.043 --> 23:35.412
Well, we don't know that
for sure, Jack.

23:35.479 --> 23:36.646
Look at the upside,

23:36.714 --> 23:38.080
it could be a whole new
career for Dexter.

23:38.148 --> 23:40.116
Oh, you don't get anything.

23:40.184 --> 23:41.384
Thanks.

23:41.452 --> 23:43.251
Well, I do get that
we gotta sell that horse

23:43.320 --> 23:44.853
while he's still worth
something.

23:44.921 --> 23:47.756
Well, he's worth a whole lot
to that daughter of yours.

23:47.824 --> 23:49.358
I know.

23:49.426 --> 23:50.793
But I gotta think
about the future.

23:50.860 --> 23:53.128
I can't sit around
and tell stories

23:53.196 --> 23:54.129
about the good ol' days,

23:54.197 --> 23:56.164
when I used to be something.

23:56.232 --> 23:57.633
Is that what this is about?

23:57.701 --> 23:59.500
Your fear of becoming
a grandfather?

23:59.568 --> 24:01.502
That is stupid.

24:01.570 --> 24:02.637
Thanks again.

24:02.705 --> 24:05.740
Wow, the hits
just keep on coming.

24:05.808 --> 24:07.542
You know,
I enjoy your insights,

24:07.609 --> 24:09.076
but this is business,

24:09.144 --> 24:12.112
and I'd appreciate it if you
kept your nose out of mine.

24:12.180 --> 24:15.983
Man: Tim, you forgot to sign.
Here it is.

24:16.051 --> 24:17.318
Oh, he's got that.

24:18.619 --> 24:20.221
Man:
Here you go.

24:21.156 --> 24:22.223
Thanks, Jack.

24:23.158 --> 24:24.458
What the...?
Hey!

24:27.262 --> 24:29.129
Peter
no, I don't get it.

24:29.197 --> 24:30.664
Well, why didn't anyone
from our bank tell us

24:30.732 --> 24:34.267
about these ridiculous rules
in the first place then?

24:34.335 --> 24:37.403
No, it's not. You know what?
It's a major screw up.

24:38.906 --> 24:39.939
Okay. Fine.

24:40.007 --> 24:41.341
But, you know,

24:41.408 --> 24:43.343
I need you to get back to me
like yesterday.

24:48.681 --> 24:49.781
Jack:
Everything okay in here?

24:50.716 --> 24:53.618
Oh, I'm sorry, Jack.

24:53.686 --> 24:55.487
I did wake you up this time,
didn't I?

24:55.554 --> 24:57.489
Don't worry about it.

24:57.556 --> 24:59.324
Trouble in Dubai?

24:59.392 --> 25:00.692
Nah.

25:01.727 --> 25:05.363
I'm having some
cash flow issues, you know.

25:05.430 --> 25:07.064
It's tough to deal with
these guys over the phone.

25:07.132 --> 25:08.499
It's a different culture,
you know.

25:08.566 --> 25:11.668
They're used to sitting down,
face to face.

25:11.736 --> 25:13.670
You need to go back, don't you?

25:14.572 --> 25:15.672
(Sighs heavily)

25:17.209 --> 25:18.642
My wife's pregnant.

25:18.710 --> 25:20.510
I mean,
what am I gonna do here?

25:21.445 --> 25:25.282
You do whatever's best
for your family,

25:25.349 --> 25:27.517
even if it's the hardest thing
you've ever done.

25:31.655 --> 25:33.423
What's with you?

25:33.490 --> 25:37.226
We're unloading Dexter,
you should be excited.

25:37.294 --> 25:39.628
Well, you know, Amy, uh...

25:39.695 --> 25:40.729
Amy doesn't know
if he's sound enough

25:40.797 --> 25:42.197
for the chucks.

25:42.265 --> 25:43.799
Tim, don't do this.

25:43.866 --> 25:46.235
Well, she's been training him.

25:46.303 --> 25:49.438
You know, she should know;
She's working with him.

25:49.505 --> 25:51.272
We have a buyer willing
to take a chance on him.

25:51.340 --> 25:54.475
We'd be crazy to back down now.

25:55.911 --> 25:58.146
You're waffling.
I can't believe it.

25:58.213 --> 25:59.247
You talk a big game,

25:59.315 --> 26:00.348
but when push comes to shove...

26:00.416 --> 26:01.749
Dexter's made me
a lot of money;

26:01.817 --> 26:04.118
he gave me my start.

26:04.186 --> 26:05.320
Don't you think we owe him?

26:05.387 --> 26:07.354
He's a racehorse;
He's supposed to win.

26:07.422 --> 26:09.022
And when he stops winning,

26:09.090 --> 26:11.258
that's it, you get rid of him.

26:11.326 --> 26:14.461
That's how this business works.

26:17.631 --> 26:19.266
Ty: Hey, stop the truck.
Caleb: What?

26:21.235 --> 26:22.336
Check it out.

26:22.403 --> 26:23.769
Chase is at the pool hall
again.

26:25.205 --> 26:27.039
Do you wanna take his money?

26:27.107 --> 26:28.740
Well, I thought you were
on your way to work.

26:28.808 --> 26:30.576
Hey, make a heck
of a lot more there

26:30.643 --> 26:31.844
then I would at Heartland.

26:31.911 --> 26:33.946
Besides, it'd feel
pretty darn good

26:34.014 --> 26:36.648
taking it from Chase,
wouldn't it?

26:36.716 --> 26:38.050
Yep.

26:38.118 --> 26:39.884
Well, it's gonna be a long day.

26:39.952 --> 26:42.487
Caleb called in with the flu.

26:42.554 --> 26:45.623
Must be the 24 hour variety.
He seemed fine yesterday.

26:45.691 --> 26:48.693
Yeah, that's the variety
that gives him 24 hours

26:48.760 --> 26:50.261
to come up with
a damn good excuse

26:50.329 --> 26:52.163
for me not to fire his ass.

26:52.231 --> 26:53.598
Lou:
I'll call Mallory.

26:53.665 --> 26:56.233
Jack:
Yeah, get her in here early.

26:56.301 --> 26:58.035
Amy:
Grampa?

26:58.103 --> 26:59.403
Did you talk to dad?

26:59.471 --> 27:01.872
Oh yeah.
It didn't go well.

27:01.939 --> 27:03.807
So he's still
entering him then?

27:03.875 --> 27:05.709
Mm-hmm.

27:05.776 --> 27:07.177
Okay, how about this?

27:07.245 --> 27:10.014
Peter and I will
put in a claim.

27:10.081 --> 27:12.848
Amy: Well, that still doesn't
mean we'd get him back.

27:12.916 --> 27:14.283
I mean, if there's more
than one claim,

27:14.351 --> 27:15.918
then it goes to a draw.

27:15.986 --> 27:17.720
That's just so random.

27:17.787 --> 27:18.754
What if Peter and I bought him

27:18.822 --> 27:20.923
before the race.

27:20.991 --> 27:22.558
What do you think?

27:22.626 --> 27:25.528
Uh... yeah.
Sure. I mean...

27:25.595 --> 27:26.695
Whatever we can do to help.

27:26.763 --> 27:28.596
That's a very generous offer,

27:28.664 --> 27:32.867
but babies have a way of
draining your bank account.

27:32.935 --> 27:34.069
Guys, I really appreciate it,

27:34.137 --> 27:36.104
but I can't ask you to do that.

27:36.172 --> 27:37.339
I'll figure something out.

27:38.774 --> 27:40.775
Chase:
Tough shot.

27:48.116 --> 27:50.484
Caleb, see you're
looking better.

27:50.552 --> 27:51.685
Caleb:
Uh... well,

27:51.753 --> 27:53.187
well...
I could've explained.

27:54.822 --> 27:56.090
Amy:
Um, are you the guys

27:56.158 --> 27:58.025
who are interested
in lightning Dexter?

27:58.093 --> 27:59.225
What's it to you?

27:59.293 --> 28:00.093
Well, I just thought
you should know

28:00.161 --> 28:01.461
the horse is lame.

28:01.529 --> 28:03.096
It's not a matter of if,

28:03.164 --> 28:04.830
it's a matter of when his leg
is gonna give out.

28:04.898 --> 28:06.266
And if he keeps running,
it's gonna happen.

28:07.101 --> 28:08.368
For five thousand bucks,
the boss will be happy

28:08.436 --> 28:09.536
if he makes it through
the season.

28:09.603 --> 28:10.803
That's right.

28:10.871 --> 28:12.238
Chase:
Hey, hey there, boys.

28:12.306 --> 28:13.806
That's the girl's horse
you're talking about.

28:13.874 --> 28:17.409
Breaks my heart to think
she might lose him.

28:17.477 --> 28:18.643
What do you say, man?

28:18.711 --> 28:20.212
Why don't you put in
a claim too?

28:20.280 --> 28:21.680
Give her a shot
at keeping that horse.

28:24.617 --> 28:26.585
All right, you won't?
I will.

28:27.987 --> 28:29.054
Chase...

28:31.057 --> 28:32.290
Wait...

28:33.158 --> 28:35.226
Chase, what the hell
was that about?

28:35.294 --> 28:36.260
I thought I was clear.

28:36.328 --> 28:37.695
I'm putting a claim on Dexter.

28:37.762 --> 28:39.997
If I win the draw
I'll gift him back to you.

28:40.065 --> 28:41.265
You'd really do that?

28:41.333 --> 28:43.101
Well, someone has to step up.

28:43.168 --> 28:44.535
And I only want one thing
in return.

28:44.603 --> 28:45.536
What?

28:45.604 --> 28:46.571
A partnership...

28:46.638 --> 28:47.670
you and me doing clinics again.

28:47.738 --> 28:48.871
C'mon, Chase...

28:48.939 --> 28:50.273
We're a great team,
the crowds love us.

28:50.341 --> 28:52.142
I already told you
I'm not interested.

28:52.210 --> 28:53.810
All right, look, Amy,
it's real simple.

28:53.877 --> 28:55.912
Do you want Dexter back or not?

28:55.980 --> 28:58.115
It's your decision.

29:00.518 --> 29:01.551
Hey, babe.

29:01.619 --> 29:02.685
Hey.

29:04.521 --> 29:05.654
What's going on?

29:05.722 --> 29:08.524
Um... nothing to be
concerned about,

29:08.592 --> 29:10.159
but there are a few things
I need to sort out

29:10.227 --> 29:11.594
with my partners.

29:11.661 --> 29:12.628
Okay.
And this is stuff

29:12.695 --> 29:14.530
I cannot do over the phone.

29:15.465 --> 29:18.800
Um... (Clears throat)
You're going back to Dubai?

29:18.868 --> 29:19.934
Yes. I am.

29:20.002 --> 29:21.802
I'm really sorry, but...

29:21.870 --> 29:23.505
This is why I came home
in the first place.

29:23.572 --> 29:27.041
'Cause you never do
what you say you're going to do.

29:27.109 --> 29:29.877
You never follow through.

29:29.945 --> 29:31.379
You can't-
that's totally unfair.

29:31.447 --> 29:33.348
I had no way of knowing
that this is gonna happen.

29:33.415 --> 29:35.415
And what's going to happen
after the baby is born?

29:35.483 --> 29:37.584
I'm gonna end up raising
this child on my own;

29:37.652 --> 29:39.620
that's what's gonna happen,

29:39.687 --> 29:41.588
and that's not
what I signed up for.

29:48.129 --> 29:53.232
Amy, you're not gonna hate me
forever over this, are you?

29:54.134 --> 29:55.468
I don't hate you.

29:55.536 --> 29:57.603
I just hate that
you're giving up on him.

29:57.671 --> 29:59.639
Well, you're the one that
asked me to stop racing him.

29:59.706 --> 30:01.707
No! I told you there's
plenty of other things

30:01.775 --> 30:03.176
that he could be doing,

30:03.243 --> 30:04.910
and the chucks
was not one of them.

30:04.978 --> 30:07.445
I'm not doing this to hurt you,

30:07.513 --> 30:09.447
or Dexter for that matter.

30:10.383 --> 30:12.116
I own racehorses.

30:12.185 --> 30:16.654
This isn't personal,
this is part of my business.

30:16.722 --> 30:17.855
Really?

30:17.923 --> 30:20.391
Is that what Janice told you?

30:22.928 --> 30:25.096
Mallory:
Mowing the lawn was Caleb's job.

30:25.164 --> 30:27.065
(Yelling)
Today, it's your...

30:29.101 --> 30:31.334
Today, it's your job.

30:32.737 --> 30:33.837
You'll get the hang of it.

30:33.905 --> 30:35.706
You should be done
by the end of day.

30:35.773 --> 30:37.440
End of the day?

30:37.508 --> 30:38.809
But you told me

30:38.876 --> 30:40.877
I'd only be working
for a couple of hours.

30:40.945 --> 30:43.313
Some girls from school
invited me out,

30:43.380 --> 30:45.548
and my parents have finally
lifted the house arrest.

30:45.616 --> 30:46.683
Well, that's good,

30:46.750 --> 30:48.517
you can meet up with them
later then.

30:48.585 --> 30:51.486
It's not my fault
Caleb called in sick.

30:51.554 --> 30:53.189
I'm short-handed,
Mallory.

30:53.256 --> 30:54.757
I need you to pick up
the slack;

30:54.825 --> 30:56.291
that is your job.

30:56.359 --> 30:57.392
Not any more.

30:59.196 --> 31:00.295
I quit.

31:14.733 --> 31:17.601
Jack: Lou, come on
, in your condition.

31:17.668 --> 31:19.402
No, it's good.

31:19.470 --> 31:21.271
It's good to work, grandpa.

31:21.339 --> 31:23.540
Got a lot to think about,
you know.

31:23.608 --> 31:24.608
What it's going to be like...

31:24.675 --> 31:26.443
How I'm going to manage...

31:26.510 --> 31:28.445
But you know what?
Lots of mothers do it, so...

31:28.512 --> 31:29.646
Do what?

31:30.548 --> 31:34.717
Everything:
Breakfast, lunch, dinner;

31:34.784 --> 31:37.018
be there in the morning,
tuck them in at night;

31:37.086 --> 31:38.721
doctor's appointments;

31:38.788 --> 31:40.589
parent teacher meetings.

31:40.657 --> 31:41.790
Mom did it, right?

31:41.858 --> 31:43.659
So I can do it too.

31:43.727 --> 31:45.160
I mean, I wasn't planning on
being a single mom,

31:45.228 --> 31:46.629
but that's just
how it works out.

31:46.696 --> 31:47.763
No one plans that.

31:48.732 --> 31:49.797
Peter's gone to Dubai.

31:51.099 --> 31:52.166
Yeah.

31:54.570 --> 31:56.337
Well, he must have
a good reason.

31:56.405 --> 31:57.838
What? Are you sticking up
for him?

31:57.906 --> 31:59.574
I'm just saying that...

31:59.642 --> 32:04.579
Some guys kind of
bury things and...

32:04.647 --> 32:06.079
Could be there's
a lot more to this

32:06.147 --> 32:07.347
than meets the eye.

32:07.415 --> 32:10.317
Sure, grandpa,
there's always a reason.

32:10.385 --> 32:12.986
There's always a reason
that he leaves.

32:13.053 --> 32:14.187
But I just...

32:16.324 --> 32:18.525
I wasn't planning on having
this baby on my own.

32:19.527 --> 32:20.994
And you won't be.

32:21.995 --> 32:24.664
You have family
to lean on.

32:24.731 --> 32:28.867
We'll make it work.
We'll all make it work.

32:30.904 --> 32:33.739
(Grunts) Careful, grandpa.

32:35.542 --> 32:38.843
Well, I've been doin'
some thinking.

32:39.779 --> 32:43.915
Well, you know how I feel
about the nursery, but...

32:47.386 --> 32:49.086
Oh my... really?

32:49.154 --> 32:50.588
Well, I figured
you'd keep on me

32:50.656 --> 32:54.024
until you got what
you wanted anyway.

32:55.694 --> 32:56.727
Thank you.

32:59.698 --> 33:01.865
So what the hell is going on
with you and Chase?

33:01.933 --> 33:04.201
Nothing.
I told you that.

33:04.268 --> 33:06.637
So why's he putting
a claim in on Dexter?

33:06.705 --> 33:09.105
He has his reasons.

33:09.173 --> 33:10.506
I'm sure he does.

33:10.574 --> 33:11.974
You know what?

33:12.042 --> 33:13.476
I'm not gonna let Dexter go
without a fight, all right?

33:13.544 --> 33:15.378
And you have no right
to judge me.

33:23.854 --> 33:25.187
(Knock on door)

33:27.189 --> 33:28.122
Hey...

33:28.190 --> 33:29.825
Hey, come on in.

33:30.760 --> 33:33.061
So I'm trying to pick out
neutral-coloured sheets

33:33.128 --> 33:34.596
for the crib.

33:34.664 --> 33:35.630
What do you think?

33:35.698 --> 33:38.299
Mint green or buttercup yellow?

33:38.368 --> 33:39.901
I don't know, Lou.

33:39.969 --> 33:41.535
That's helpful.

33:41.603 --> 33:44.905
I just have a lot
on my mind, okay?

33:44.973 --> 33:46.006
Like Ty?

33:49.244 --> 33:51.846
I know it must be rough.

33:53.181 --> 33:55.983
Do you wanna talk about it?

33:56.985 --> 33:58.685
Okay.

33:58.753 --> 34:02.689
Well, if you change your mind,
just let me know.

34:03.624 --> 34:06.158
I did something
really stupid today.

34:06.226 --> 34:08.159
I let Chase put a claim in
on Dexter

34:08.228 --> 34:10.397
and Ty was right there.

34:10.464 --> 34:12.164
And the worse part is...

34:12.232 --> 34:14.900
I told Chase that
if he won the draw,

34:14.967 --> 34:18.570
I would start doing clinics
with him again.

34:18.638 --> 34:21.706
Does dad have any idea
what he's putting you through?

34:21.775 --> 34:24.743
No. He just keeps saying
it's business.

34:24.811 --> 34:25.944
But I think it's Janice,

34:26.012 --> 34:27.880
'cause she's keeps pushing him.

34:27.947 --> 34:32.283
He's gotta know how much
this is killing you.

34:33.985 --> 34:36.420
But you know what?
Maybe he's right.

34:36.487 --> 34:37.955
Maybe we should just be
thinking about this

34:38.023 --> 34:39.356
as a business.

34:44.763 --> 34:46.696
Mallory:
Can I take your order?

34:46.764 --> 34:48.532
Mallory?!

34:48.599 --> 34:51.234
I would recommend
the ranchman's special.

34:51.302 --> 34:52.636
We can make it with egg whites

34:52.703 --> 34:54.003
if you're trying to watch
your cholesterol.

34:54.071 --> 34:56.172
You can't be serious.

34:56.239 --> 34:58.775
What? You didn't think
I could get another job?

34:58.843 --> 35:01.110
Come on, Mallory,
why are you doing this?

35:01.178 --> 35:02.845
You like working at Heartland.

35:02.913 --> 35:04.914
Really?
What's to like?

35:07.417 --> 35:08.651
Okay, I used to...

35:08.718 --> 35:09.952
I used to like working
at Heartland,

35:10.019 --> 35:11.454
but things have changed.

35:11.521 --> 35:12.922
I mean, Lou's going
to have that baby,

35:12.989 --> 35:15.057
and the baby's gonna
need that room...

35:15.124 --> 35:17.692
and I'm sure you've already
given in to her by now.

35:17.760 --> 35:20.929
Well, that's no reason
to quit your job.

35:20.996 --> 35:23.765
I miss the way things
used to be...

35:23.833 --> 35:24.899
I miss Ty.

35:29.104 --> 35:33.140
Things... people...
They have a way of moving on.

35:33.208 --> 35:35.943
I think I need to move on too.

35:38.880 --> 35:40.514
Well, that's your choice
to make.

35:45.019 --> 35:47.420
So, the ranchman's special?

35:47.489 --> 35:48.889
No thanks.

35:51.925 --> 35:53.325
I uh...

35:54.728 --> 35:56.796
Kinda lost my appetite.

36:07.072 --> 36:08.874
Did your boss put in
that claim on Dexter?

36:08.941 --> 36:10.675
Yup. That's right.

36:10.743 --> 36:12.010
So did I,

36:12.077 --> 36:13.177
and I got a horseshoe
up my butt today.

36:13.245 --> 36:16.381
Usually it's just your head.

36:16.448 --> 36:18.383
Care to test that luck, Chase?

36:18.450 --> 36:20.952
One game, you and me.

36:21.020 --> 36:22.887
Five thousand bucks.
(Laughs)

36:22.954 --> 36:24.388
Oh!
Woo!

36:24.455 --> 36:28.425
If I win, I get to put
the claim in on Dexter.

36:28.493 --> 36:30.693
No strings attached.

36:30.761 --> 36:31.761
Now, how is a guy living
in a trailer

36:31.829 --> 36:33.930
gonna settle that wager?

36:33.998 --> 36:35.798
I can cover it.

36:38.569 --> 36:40.770
Phew! Have at her.

36:40.838 --> 36:41.871
Rack 'em up.

36:44.775 --> 36:46.074
(Truck rumbles)

37:04.726 --> 37:06.027
Oh boy...

37:06.094 --> 37:07.662
This why I've been doing
all your work for you?

37:07.729 --> 37:09.430
I'm sorry, Jack,
but I'll make it up to you.

37:09.497 --> 37:11.999
Oh, damn right you will.

37:12.067 --> 37:13.768
I gotta stay though.
Ty needs me.

37:13.835 --> 37:16.103
No, he's doing a good enough job
of wasting his time

37:16.171 --> 37:17.237
all by himself.

37:17.305 --> 37:18.638
You don't understand.

37:18.706 --> 37:20.974
He's playing Chase
for five thousand bucks.

37:21.042 --> 37:22.208
And if he wins,

37:22.276 --> 37:23.877
he's gonna put a claim
on Dexter;

37:23.945 --> 37:25.211
win him back for Amy.

37:25.279 --> 37:27.180
Ty doesn't have that kind of...

37:27.247 --> 37:29.983
Ugh...
Not his school money!

37:36.456 --> 37:39.357
What is the matter with you?

37:40.326 --> 37:41.594
Are you even any good at this?

37:41.661 --> 37:43.062
Yes, I am.

the claim on Dexter.

39:30.697 --> 39:31.797
See you at the track.

39:34.033 --> 39:35.366
Jack
hey! Wait!

39:36.736 --> 39:38.970
He's not worth the effort.

39:39.806 --> 39:40.906
Just a minute.

39:43.809 --> 39:46.543
You need to go
put that claim in now.

39:46.611 --> 39:49.313
Don't tell Amy about this.

40:02.932 --> 40:05.367
Tim: All right, I've
entered him in the race,

40:05.434 --> 40:07.035
you might as well
hold your breath.

40:07.103 --> 40:09.638
Stop giving me crap about it,
because this is just...

40:09.706 --> 40:11.006
Lou:
Business. I know.

40:11.073 --> 40:12.507
I agree with you completely.

40:12.574 --> 40:14.709
Finally, somebody gets it.

40:14.776 --> 40:16.210
Um... here.

40:17.145 --> 40:18.646
Tim:
What's this?

40:18.714 --> 40:20.848
Oh, it's just the bill
for Dexter's board and rehab.

40:22.651 --> 40:24.051
You gotta be kidding me?

40:24.119 --> 40:25.553
This is more than
we'll make in the claim.

40:25.621 --> 40:26.787
You know our policy, dad.

40:26.855 --> 40:28.222
We cannot release a horse

40:28.289 --> 40:30.290
until we've been paid in full
by the client,

40:30.358 --> 40:32.493
and that would be you.

40:33.427 --> 40:35.128
Mm-hm.
(Laughs)

40:38.399 --> 40:39.566
Okay, you win.

40:42.103 --> 40:44.337
I'll pull him from the race.

40:45.238 --> 40:46.305
Thank you.

40:49.777 --> 40:53.179
So... were you in on
their little stunt too?

40:53.246 --> 40:55.281
No, of course not.

40:55.349 --> 40:58.518
Wow! So basically
you just caved in.

40:59.487 --> 41:01.921
Getting kind of soft
in your old age there, gramps.

41:01.988 --> 41:03.856
Yeah, maybe I am.

41:07.293 --> 41:09.795
I just put family first.

41:09.863 --> 41:12.998
And if Amy loves
that damn horse so much,

41:13.066 --> 41:14.266
I'm good with that.

41:18.070 --> 41:19.638
Lou: Been looking
all over for you.

41:23.108 --> 41:25.744
Grampa says we can do
the nursery.

41:25.812 --> 41:28.480
Good. Good.
That's great.

41:29.549 --> 41:31.416
Hey, listen,

41:31.484 --> 41:33.284
about what I said before...

41:33.351 --> 41:36.421
No, it's okay, you were right.

41:37.989 --> 41:41.025
Honestly, I mean...
I'm worried too.

41:41.993 --> 41:43.961
I don't know how we're gonna
make this work.

41:46.131 --> 41:47.932
We just will.

41:47.999 --> 41:49.466
I love you.

41:49.534 --> 41:51.334
I love you too.

41:51.803 --> 41:55.005
Now go deal with your business

41:55.072 --> 41:59.242
and get your butt back here
as soon as you can, okay?

41:59.310 --> 42:03.814
And I'll just distract myself
with this nursery until then.

42:09.587 --> 42:11.254
Amy: Hey, Soraya!
Did you hear the good news?

42:11.321 --> 42:12.622
My dad pulled him
from the race.

42:12.690 --> 42:13.956
I get to keep him!

42:14.024 --> 42:15.191
That is so great.

42:15.259 --> 42:16.325
I know.

42:16.394 --> 42:19.529
Sure saved Chase
a couple bucks.

42:19.597 --> 42:21.930
I heard he put in a claim.

42:21.998 --> 42:23.899
Any reason I should be worried
about my boyfriend

42:23.967 --> 42:27.370
giving my best friend
such expensive gifts?

42:27.437 --> 42:28.704
It wasn't a gift.

42:28.772 --> 42:31.039
I was going to do
some clinics with him.

42:31.107 --> 42:32.140
That is what he said.

42:33.710 --> 42:36.545
Um, anyway,
I gotta go meet Lou,

42:36.612 --> 42:38.380
go over the books
for the dude ranch, so...

42:38.448 --> 42:40.615
Yeah.
I'll talk to you later.

42:40.683 --> 42:41.717
Okay, see ya.

42:45.488 --> 42:48.523
So it turns out Jack's
not gonna kill me.

42:48.591 --> 42:50.826
He's just gonna try
and work me to death.

42:50.893 --> 42:52.360
(Laughs)

42:52.428 --> 42:54.995
Yeah.
That was one crazy day.

42:55.063 --> 42:56.798
Yeah, crazy good for you.

42:56.865 --> 42:58.199
Extra 5 large in your pocket.

42:58.266 --> 43:00.668
Yeah...

43:00.736 --> 43:02.637
I'm just glad Tim
pulled Dexter.

43:02.705 --> 43:04.505
I don't know what
would've been worse:

43:04.573 --> 43:05.740
If Dexter had ended up
in the chucks

43:05.808 --> 43:07.542
or Amy owing Chase Powers
big time.

43:09.811 --> 43:12.078
Chase Powers
would've been worse.

43:12.146 --> 43:13.747
(Laughing)

43:14.582 --> 43:16.883
Hey, man, I gotta thank you
for giving me a place to stay.

43:16.951 --> 43:19.252
It's no worries, man.
You're a good guy.

43:19.321 --> 43:21.322
No, I'm serious, man.

43:21.389 --> 43:23.424
I wanna split
the five grand with you,

43:23.491 --> 43:25.491
just like we do
with all our pool winnings.

43:25.559 --> 43:27.092
You can't, man,
I didn't even play.

43:27.160 --> 43:29.228
Shut up and take the money,
all right?

43:29.296 --> 43:30.330
We're partners.

43:30.397 --> 43:32.732
Pay off some of that debt.

43:32.800 --> 43:33.866
Thanks, man.

43:36.937 --> 43:39.339
I'm gonna tell Ashley.

43:44.043 --> 43:47.746
Ashley: (Squeals)
