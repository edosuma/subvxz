WEBVTT

00:05.706 --> 00:07.275
SO I'VE GOT HER
SPREAD-EAGLED

00:07.375 --> 00:09.977
ON TOP OF A TABLE
IN THE LAW SCHOOL LIBRARY
AFTER HOURS

00:10.078 --> 00:13.614
AND I AM TERRIFIED

00:13.714 --> 00:16.850
BECAUSE, WELL,
YOU KNOW...

00:16.950 --> 00:18.552
BECAUSE YOU'RE
AFRAID THAT--

00:18.652 --> 00:20.521
YES.
MM-HMM.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.790
I SWEAR TO GOD,
I'M RECITING TORT REFORM
IN MY HEAD

00:22.890 --> 00:25.093
SO I WON'T COME.

00:25.193 --> 00:27.828
SO FINALLY I GET
HER PANTIES OFF

00:27.928 --> 00:29.663
AND SHE'S SITTING
THERE BUCK NAKED

00:29.763 --> 00:32.666
ON TOP OF
ALL THESE BACK ISSUES
OF "THE LAW REVIEW."

00:32.766 --> 00:35.236
AND SUDDENLY
I JUST KNOW

00:35.336 --> 00:38.906
THAT IT ISN'T
GOING TO HAPPEN.

00:39.006 --> 00:41.775
YOU COULDN'T HAVE--

00:41.875 --> 00:45.746
RIGHT, YEAH.

00:45.846 --> 00:48.015
AND SHE TURNS TO ME
AND SHE SAYS,

00:48.116 --> 00:50.751
"IT'S OKAY, ELI,
YOU KNOW.

00:50.851 --> 00:52.286
IT HAPPENS TO EVERYBODY
SOMETIMES."

00:52.386 --> 00:55.323
AND SHE IS SO FUCKING
UNDERSTANDING

00:55.423 --> 00:57.258
THAT IT REALLY FUCKING
PISSES ME OFF.

00:57.358 --> 00:59.260
AND THEN
SHE STARTS TO SAY

00:59.360 --> 01:01.329
ALL OF THESE
REALLY SHITTY THINGS.

01:01.429 --> 01:02.896
LIKE WHAT?

01:02.996 --> 01:04.898
"DON'T GET
SO UPSET, ELI.

01:04.998 --> 01:07.635
IT ISN'T MANLY."

01:07.735 --> 01:10.971
I MEAN, WHAT THE FUCK
DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?
WHAT THE FUCK IS MANLY?

01:11.071 --> 01:13.674
( crashing )

01:15.676 --> 01:19.613
CAN YOU JUST
GIVE ME A SECOND,
PLEASE?

01:28.689 --> 01:30.458
I'M SORRY.

01:30.558 --> 01:33.961
THAT'S OKAY.

01:34.061 --> 01:36.096
YOU'RE ABOUT AN HOUR
AND A HALF EARLY.

01:36.197 --> 01:38.699
I CAN WAIT.

01:38.799 --> 01:40.534
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

01:40.634 --> 01:44.104
SHOULDN'T YOU BE
IN SCHOOL?

01:44.205 --> 01:46.240
WE GOT OUT EARLY.

01:46.340 --> 01:49.210
YOU CAME HERE
BY YOURSELF?

01:49.310 --> 01:52.980
WHERE'S YOUR MOM
AND DAD?

01:53.080 --> 01:56.417
- I RAN AWAY FROM SCHOOL.
- OH.

01:56.517 --> 01:58.786
I CAN'T
GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

02:00.854 --> 02:02.990
UM, OKAY.

02:03.090 --> 02:04.592
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU CAN STAY HERE.

02:04.692 --> 02:06.960
BUT I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO CALL YOUR DAD.

02:07.060 --> 02:09.430
GOOD.

02:12.500 --> 02:17.305
( theme music playing )

02:34.154 --> 02:35.656
ARE YOU MAD AT ME?

02:35.756 --> 02:37.225
NOT AT ALL.

02:37.325 --> 02:38.792
BUT I AM CONCERNED
ABOUT YOU.

02:38.892 --> 02:41.929
DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHY YOU RAN AWAY
FROM SCHOOL?

02:42.029 --> 02:43.497
BAD DAY.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.233
WHAT HAPPENED?

02:45.333 --> 02:47.268
CAN'T I JUST
SIT HERE?

02:47.368 --> 02:49.136
I JUST THOUGHT--
YOU CAME HERE SO EARLY,

02:49.237 --> 02:51.905
YOU MUST HAVE SOMETHING
THAT YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.441
I TOLD YOU--

02:53.541 --> 02:55.443
MY MOM'S STILL AWAY
AND MY DAD'S AT WORK.

02:55.543 --> 02:58.145
BUT YOU'VE GOT KEYS
TO BOTH THEIR APARTMENTS,

02:58.246 --> 03:00.848
AND YOU CAME HERE.

03:00.948 --> 03:04.452
DO YOU HAVE
ANY MORE HAM?

03:04.552 --> 03:07.120
YOU WANT ME TO MAKE YOU
ANOTHER SANDWICH?

03:07.221 --> 03:08.722
IS THAT OKAY?

03:08.822 --> 03:10.358
SURE.
I CAN DO THAT.

03:10.458 --> 03:12.192
BUT I HOPE BY NOW
YOU UNDERSTAND

03:12.293 --> 03:14.161
THAT IF THERE'S
SOMETHING BOTHERING YOU,

03:14.262 --> 03:17.665
YOU CAN TALK
TO ME ABOUT IT.

03:19.700 --> 03:23.671
SOMEBODY PUT DOG SHIT
IN MY LOCKER.

03:35.783 --> 03:37.918
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

03:39.119 --> 03:40.988
WHEN WAS THIS?

03:41.088 --> 03:43.524
I CAME DOWN FROM
THE ROOF AT RECESS

03:43.624 --> 03:46.594
TO GET MY GLOVES
OUT OF MY LOCKER.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.362
WHEN I OPENED IT

03:48.462 --> 03:51.465
THERE WAS DOG SHIT
EVERYWHERE,

03:51.565 --> 03:53.834
ALL OVER MY BACKPACK
AND ALL MY STUFF.

03:53.934 --> 03:55.903
I WENT BACK TO THE ROOF
TO TELL MY TEACHER.

03:56.003 --> 03:58.672
- WHAT DID SHE SAY?
- SHE GOT A JANITOR
TO CLEAN IT UP.

03:58.772 --> 04:01.241
BUT RECESS WAS OVER,
SO EVERYBODY KNEW
WHAT HAPPENED.

04:01.342 --> 04:04.778
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE?

04:04.878 --> 04:06.246
ERIC.

04:06.347 --> 04:10.017
BUT NOBODY SAW HIM,

04:10.117 --> 04:11.585
SO NOTHING'S GONNA
HAPPEN TO HIM.

04:11.685 --> 04:15.389
YEAH, WELL, I REMEMBER
WHAT HE DID TO YOUR SHOES,

04:15.489 --> 04:19.660
SO I GUESS THIS WOULD BE
HIS NEXT LOGICAL STEP.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.962
ALL THROUGH MATH
EVERYBODY LAUGHED
ABOUT IT.

04:22.062 --> 04:26.334
THE TEACHER GOT UPSET
'CAUSE NO ONE WAS
PAYING ATTENTION.

04:26.434 --> 04:29.503
THAT WAS
MY FAULT TOO.

04:29.603 --> 04:33.407
LISTEN, SOMEBODY DID
SOMETHING AWFUL TO YOU.

04:33.507 --> 04:36.276
THAT IS NOT
YOUR FAULT, OKAY?

04:37.945 --> 04:41.014
I ASKED MY TEACHER
IF I COULD GO TO
THE BATHROOM.

04:41.114 --> 04:44.985
BUT I WENT
TO THE LOBBY INSTEAD.

04:45.085 --> 04:48.288
WHILE THE GUARD WAS
TALKING TO SOMEONE ELSE,
I SNUCK OUT.

04:48.389 --> 04:51.692
WELL, YOU WEREN'T
KIDDING.

04:54.428 --> 04:57.898
YOU HAD
A HELL OF A DAY.

04:57.998 --> 05:01.969
BUT I'M GLAD YOU
CAME HERE SO THAT WE
CAN TALK ABOUT IT.

05:02.069 --> 05:04.405
MY DAD'S
GONNA BE SO MAD.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.407
AND HE'S ALREADY
REALLY MAD.

05:06.507 --> 05:08.876
- WHAT'S HE MAD ABOUT?
- EVERYTHING.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.779
I'VE BEEN STAYING
WITH HIM FOR TWO WEEKS
SINCE MOM WENT AWAY.

05:11.879 --> 05:14.582
AND HE YELLS
AT ME ALL THE TIME,
NO MATTER WHAT I DO.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.283
SO WHAT DO YOU DO
WHEN HE YELLS AT YOU?

05:16.384 --> 05:17.785
LET HIM YELL.

05:17.885 --> 05:21.489
DO YOU EVER DISCUSS
THE THINGS YOU FIGHT ABOUT?

05:21.589 --> 05:24.257
HE DOESN'T TALK TO ME
UNLESS HE'S YELLING.

05:24.358 --> 05:27.027
I THINK HE BROKE UP
WITH NINA.

05:27.127 --> 05:28.562
DID HE TELL YOU THAT?

05:28.662 --> 05:31.164
NO, BUT SHE DOESN'T
COME OVER ANYMORE.

05:31.264 --> 05:32.966
THAT'S MY FAULT TOO.

05:33.066 --> 05:35.669
THAT CAN'T BE YOUR FAULT.

05:35.769 --> 05:39.573
NINA TOLD MY DAD TO MAKE
BETTER RULES FOR ME.

05:39.673 --> 05:42.242
AND THEN THEY HAD
THIS BIG FIGHT.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.645
NOW SHE DOESN'T
COME OVER.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.714
AND WHEN I SEE HER AT SCHOOL
SHE DOESN'T SMILE AT ME.

05:46.814 --> 05:49.216
- DO YOU MISS HER?
- NOT REALLY.

05:49.316 --> 05:51.719
BUT I THINK
MY DAD DOES.

05:54.922 --> 05:57.425
HE DID A REALLY BAD THING
THE DAY AFTER THE FIGHT.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.159
WHAT DID HE DO?

05:59.259 --> 06:01.929
I SHOULDN'T TELL YOU.

06:02.029 --> 06:05.433
OKAY.
IT'S UP TO YOU.

06:07.300 --> 06:09.302
HE BOUGHT
A SIX-PACK OF BEER

06:09.403 --> 06:11.171
AND DRANK ALL OF IT

06:11.271 --> 06:13.040
AND HE FELL ASLEEP
ON THE COUCH.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.809
- AND WHAT HAPPENED?
- HE DIDN'T GET UP IN TIME
FOR WORK.

06:15.909 --> 06:17.611
HE YELLED AT ME
FOR THAT TOO.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.613
"WHY DIDN'T YOU
WAKE ME UP?"

06:19.713 --> 06:22.450
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW
I WAS SUPPOSED TO DO THAT.

06:22.550 --> 06:24.284
THERE WAS NO WAY
YOU COULD'VE KNOWN

06:24.384 --> 06:25.819
WHAT YOU WERE
SUPPOSED TO DO.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.755
MY MOM WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE BACK BY NOW.

06:27.855 --> 06:30.824
BUT SHE HAD TO STAY
ON HER VACATION
AN EXTRA WEEK.

06:30.924 --> 06:33.360
HAVE YOU TOLD HER ABOUT
THE FIGHTS YOU'VE BEEN
HAVING WITH YOUR DAD?

06:33.461 --> 06:36.196
NO, SHE'LL JUST
GET SAD.

06:36.296 --> 06:40.634
WELL, IF I WERE
IN YOUR SHOES,

06:40.734 --> 06:43.003
I'D BE REALLY UPSET
ABOUT ALL THAT.

06:43.103 --> 06:46.073
( door opens )

06:46.173 --> 06:49.209
YOU KNOW, OLIVER,
I KEEP THINKING YOU'VE SUNK
AS LOW AS YOU CAN GO,

06:49.309 --> 06:51.378
BUT IT TURNS OUT
THERE'S NO BOTTOM.

06:51.479 --> 06:53.547
LUKE, WHY DON'T WE
JUST SIT DOWN?

06:53.647 --> 06:55.449
WE CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED TO OLIVER TODAY.

06:55.549 --> 06:58.886
I GET OUT OF MY MEETING--
I HAVE SEVEN MESSAGES
FROM YOUR SCHOOL.

06:58.986 --> 07:01.889
WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU
THINKING TO JUST DISAPPEAR
LIKE THAT?

07:01.989 --> 07:04.458
ERIC DUMPED DOG SHIT
ALL IN MY LOCKER.

07:04.558 --> 07:06.226
HE DID WHAT?

07:06.326 --> 07:08.161
APPARENTLY
DURING RECESS TODAY

07:08.261 --> 07:11.164
SOME KID VANDALIZED
OLIVER'S LOCKER.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.600
NOBODY SAW
WHO DID IT.

07:12.700 --> 07:14.602
BUT ALL THE KIDS KNEW
THAT IT HAD HAPPENED.

07:14.702 --> 07:16.637
I HATE THAT FUCKING PLACE
AND I'M NOT GOING BACK.

07:16.737 --> 07:19.740
- NOBODY TOLD ME THAT.
- WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK ME
BEFORE YOU STARTED YELLING?

07:19.840 --> 07:21.509
BECAUSE YOU STILL SHOULDN'T
JUST RUN OFF FROM SCHOOL.

07:21.609 --> 07:24.612
IT'S DANGEROUS
AND YOU KNOW BETTER.

07:24.712 --> 07:26.780
OLIVER, I THINK
THAT WHAT YOUR DAD
IS TRYING TO SAY

07:26.880 --> 07:30.651
IS THAT HE UNDERSTANDS
THAT YOU'VE HAD A BAD DAY.

07:30.751 --> 07:35.523
AND HE'S JUST CONCERNED
THAT YOU LEFT SCHOOL

07:35.623 --> 07:38.058
AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY
WHERE YOU WERE GOING.

07:38.158 --> 07:41.228
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THIS ANYMORE.

07:41.328 --> 07:42.530
Paul:
I UNDERSTAND.

07:42.630 --> 07:45.465
OKAY, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST GO OUTSIDE

07:45.566 --> 07:47.701
AND I'LL TALK
TO YOUR DAD, OKAY?

07:57.745 --> 07:59.680
( door closes )

08:09.723 --> 08:11.491
WHERE WERE YOU
LAST WEEK?

08:11.592 --> 08:14.862
I'M SORRY
I COULDN'T BE HERE.

08:14.962 --> 08:18.098
FIRST BESS VANISHES
ON THIS APPARENTLY
PERMANENT VACATION,

08:18.198 --> 08:19.633
AND THEN YOU GO AWOL.

08:19.733 --> 08:22.235
IT'S LIKE RATS DESERTING
A SINKING SHIP.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.771
IT WAS
AN EMERGENCY, LUKE.

08:23.871 --> 08:26.540
YEAH, WELL,
IT'S AN EMERGENCY
OVER HERE TOO.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.441
EVERY DAY HE COMES UP
WITH A NEW WAY

08:28.542 --> 08:31.478
TO DRIVE ME
UP THE FUCKING WALL.

08:31.579 --> 08:33.581
SO YOU'VE HAD A TOUGH
COUPLE OF WEEKS?

08:33.681 --> 08:35.549
BESS CALLS EVERY DAY.

08:35.649 --> 08:37.551
AND WE LIE AND TELL HER
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

08:37.651 --> 08:39.953
AND SHE SAYS SHE NEEDS
A LITTLE MORE TIME.

08:40.053 --> 08:43.156
THAT MUST BE
PRETTY STRESSFUL
ON YOU AND OLIVER.

08:43.256 --> 08:45.726
FIRST HE SUDDENLY DECIDES
HE WON'T DO HIS HOMEWORK.

08:45.826 --> 08:49.663
HE SAYS HE'S TAKING
A STAND ON PRINCIPLE--

08:49.763 --> 08:51.632
THE PRINCIPLE
THAT SCHOOL IS STUPID.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.567
HAVE YOU TALKED TO HIM
ABOUT IT

08:53.667 --> 08:56.637
OR WERE YOU HOPING
I WOULD SAY SOMETHING?

08:58.271 --> 09:01.441
I TOOK AWAY
HIS TV PRIVILEGES AND
HIS COMPUTER PRIVILEGES,

09:01.541 --> 09:04.011
BUT HE STILL WON'T DO
HIS HOMEWORK.

09:04.111 --> 09:06.346
HE JUST SITS THERE
AND STARES AT THE WALL.

09:06.446 --> 09:09.382
HE CERTAINLY KNOWS
HOW TO PUSH YOUR BUTTONS,
DOESN'T HE?

09:09.482 --> 09:11.484
NEXT HE DECIDES
TO STOP BATHING.

09:11.585 --> 09:13.687
WHAT THE HELL
AM I SUPPOSED TO DO,

09:13.787 --> 09:16.389
CLIMB INTO
THE SHOWER WITH HIM
AND SOAP HIM DOWN?

09:16.489 --> 09:18.826
I THINK OLIVER FEELS
POWERLESS,

09:18.926 --> 09:20.628
SO HE'S REFUSING
TO FOLLOW THE RULES

09:20.728 --> 09:22.630
BECAUSE THAT'S
THE ONLY WAY

09:22.730 --> 09:25.498
THAT HE CAN GET
SOME CONTROL.

09:25.599 --> 09:28.702
YESTERDAY, AFTER HE
LEFT FOR SCHOOL

09:28.802 --> 09:31.338
I WENT INTO HIS ROOM
AND LOOKED UNDER HIS BED,

09:31.438 --> 09:33.506
PAST THE MOUNTAIN
OF DIRTY CLOTHES.

09:33.607 --> 09:35.375
THERE WAS ALL THIS FOOD
HIDDEN IN THERE--

09:35.475 --> 09:37.745
HALF-EMPTY PACKAGES

09:37.845 --> 09:40.147
OF OREOS AND DORITOS
AND CHEETOS.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.882
I MEAN, THERE WAS--

09:41.982 --> 09:43.751
DID YOU TELL OLIVER
WHAT YOU'D FOUND?

09:43.851 --> 09:45.585
YEAH, AND HE GOT
FURIOUS,

09:45.686 --> 09:49.489
RAN INTO HIS ROOM
AND SLAMMED THE DOOR.

09:49.589 --> 09:54.094
I SHOULD'VE GONE IN
AND TALKED TO HIM,
BUT I WAS SO EXHAUSTED.

09:54.194 --> 09:56.296
I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU'D BE ALARMED
BY ALL THIS.

09:56.396 --> 09:59.399
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'VE WORKED WITH
A LOT OF KIDS

09:59.499 --> 10:01.601
IN SITUATIONS
SIMILAR TO OLIVER'S

10:01.702 --> 10:06.473
AND OVEREATING IS
A PRETTY COMMON RESPONSE.

10:06.573 --> 10:10.811
YOU KNOW, THIS--

10:10.911 --> 10:15.215
THIS THING THAT HAPPENED
AT SCHOOL TODAY,

10:15.315 --> 10:19.152
IT ISN'T
THE FIRST TIME.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.454
OLIVER GETS
BULLIED A LOT.

10:21.554 --> 10:23.857
HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING
ABOUT IT?

10:23.957 --> 10:26.093
NOW THAT THE SCHOOL
KNOWS THERE'S A PROBLEM,

10:26.193 --> 10:29.663
THEY'RE OBLIGATED
TO HELP YOU FIND
A SOLUTION.

10:29.763 --> 10:31.799
WELL, NOW,

10:31.899 --> 10:34.167
HOW ARE THEY
GOING TO STOP KIDS
FROM PICKING ON OLIVER?

10:34.267 --> 10:38.638
I MEAN, YOU SEE
WHY IT HAPPENS, RIGHT?

10:38.739 --> 10:40.640
I MEAN, HE'S FAT,
HE'S SHY,

10:40.741 --> 10:42.810
HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS
AND HE SMELLS BAD.

10:42.910 --> 10:46.680
IF I WERE HIS AGE,
I'D PROBABLY BULLY
HIM TOO.

10:49.482 --> 10:52.753
THE WAY HE'S BEEN
BEHAVING LATELY,

10:52.853 --> 10:55.088
I CAN SEE HOW THAT
WOULD MAKE YOU ANGRY.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.624
SOMETIMES I JUST WANT
TO SHAKE HIM AND SAY,

10:57.725 --> 11:01.161
"IF YOU KEEP ACTING
LIKE THIS, NO ONE'S EVER
GONNA BE YOUR FRIEND.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.864
IS THAT
WHAT YOU WANT?"

11:06.599 --> 11:08.501
THAT'S UNFORGIVEABLE,
ISN'T IT?

11:08.601 --> 11:11.071
I THINK YOU WANT
TO TRY AND SPARE OLIVER

11:11.171 --> 11:13.673
FROM THE PAIN THAT HE'S
GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.642
BUT YOU LOVE HIM
SO MUCH

11:15.743 --> 11:18.545
AND THAT MAKES YOU
FRUSTRATED AND ANGRY.

11:18.645 --> 11:22.449
YEAH, BUT WHAT
GOOD IS LOVING HIM
IF I CAN'T HELP HIM?

11:22.549 --> 11:25.218
BUT ISN'T LOVING HIM
HELPING HIM?

11:27.788 --> 11:31.091
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT ANYTHING THIS WEEK.

11:33.593 --> 11:35.328
SO WHAT ELSE HAS BEEN
GOING ON, LUKE?

11:35.428 --> 11:38.298
LOOKS LIKE
I'M SINGLE AGAIN.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.968
NINA AND I HAD A HUGE
FIGHT ABOUT OLIVER.

11:41.068 --> 11:43.804
AND THE REASON
I ASKED HER OUT
IN THE FIRST PLACE

11:43.904 --> 11:45.806
IS BECAUSE
SHE LIKED HIM.

11:45.906 --> 11:47.741
I THOUGHT SHE'D BE
GOOD WITH HIM.

11:47.841 --> 11:51.211
BUT IT TURNED OUT
SHE JUST ISN'T ON MY SIDE.

11:51.311 --> 11:54.314
AND WHOSE SIDE
DO YOU THINK SHE'S ON?

11:54.414 --> 11:58.018
LAST WEEK OLIVER DROPPED
A CARTON OF ICE CREAM
ON THE CARPET.

11:58.118 --> 12:00.854
OF COURSE
I GOT PISSED OFF.

12:00.954 --> 12:02.823
THEN NINA CAME OVER

12:02.923 --> 12:05.458
AND FOR SOME STUPID REASON
I EXPECTED HER TO BACK ME.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.095
SO YOU WANTED HER
TO HELP YOU

12:08.195 --> 12:10.097
DISCIPLINE OLIVER.

12:10.197 --> 12:12.132
BUT INSTEAD SHE STARTED
SCREAMING AT ME.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.534
SHE SAID I WASN'T SPENDING
ENOUGH TIME WITH OLIVER,

12:14.634 --> 12:17.137
I WASN'T SETTING CLEAR
BOUNDARIES FOR HIM.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.106
AND HOW DID YOU
RESPOND TO THAT?

12:19.206 --> 12:21.574
I TOLD HER IF I WANTED
SOMEBODY YELLING AT ME
ALL THE TIME,

12:21.674 --> 12:24.211
I WOULD'VE STAYED
MARRIED TO BESS.

12:24.311 --> 12:28.248
( chuckles )
THAT WENT OVER
REAL WELL.

12:31.684 --> 12:34.621
YOU KNOW, AT FIRST
NINA WAS A LOT OF FUN.

12:34.721 --> 12:36.857
I COULD COME HOME
AT THE END OF THE DAY

12:36.957 --> 12:39.192
AND JUST RELAX
WITH HER.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.161
THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN

12:41.261 --> 12:43.797
SHE STARTED SCRUTINIZING
MY EVERY MOVE,

12:43.897 --> 12:45.365
MARSHALLING EVIDENCE
AGAINST ME.

12:45.465 --> 12:48.068
I DON'T KNOW, PAUL.

12:48.168 --> 12:50.103
WHY DO I KEEP CHOOSING
THESE CRAZY WOMEN?

12:50.203 --> 12:54.041
I'M NOT SO SURE, LUKE,
THAT IT'S THE WOMEN
WHO ARE CRAZY.

12:54.141 --> 12:56.076
I THINK
IT'S THE POSITION

12:56.176 --> 12:58.245
THAT YOU'RE
PUTTING THEM IN.

12:58.345 --> 13:00.981
SO YOU'RE SAYING
IT'S ALL MY FAULT?

13:01.081 --> 13:03.884
FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN,
YOU ENJOY HAVING FUN
WITH OLIVER.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.853
BUT WHEN IT COMES
TO MAKING THE RULES,

13:05.953 --> 13:07.855
CREATING A STRUCTURE
FOR HIM,

13:07.955 --> 13:10.323
FOR A LONG TIME
YOU LET BESS DO THAT JOB.

13:10.423 --> 13:13.793
AND THEN YOU HOPED
THAT NINA WOULD TAKE
HER PLACE.

13:13.894 --> 13:16.763
SO WHEN HE MISBEHAVES,

13:16.864 --> 13:19.432
YOU BLAME THEM.

13:19.532 --> 13:24.037
YOU REFUSE TO TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY FOR
OLIVER YOURSELF.

13:24.137 --> 13:28.675
SO CAN YOU SEE HOW THAT
MIGHT UPSET EVERYBODY?

13:28.775 --> 13:31.178
BOY, NOW I COULD
REALLY USE A DRINK.

13:31.278 --> 13:33.746
HAVE YOU BEEN
DRINKING LATELY?

13:33.847 --> 13:36.749
WHAT DID OLIVER
TELL YOU?

13:36.850 --> 13:38.618
WHY WOULD YOU
ASK ME THAT?

13:38.718 --> 13:40.220
BECAUSE THE NIGHT
I BROKE UP WITH NINA

13:40.320 --> 13:42.289
I WENT OUT
AND GOT A SIX-PACK,

13:42.389 --> 13:45.258
DRANK THE WHOLE THING
RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE KID.

13:45.358 --> 13:48.661
I THOUGHT,
"LET HIM TELL NINA,

13:48.761 --> 13:50.630
OR BESS, OR YOU."

13:50.730 --> 13:51.999
WHY NOT?

13:52.099 --> 13:54.902
SO YOU WANTED OLIVER
TO TELL US?

13:55.002 --> 13:56.336
I DON'T CARE.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.138
I NEVER REALLY HAD
A DRINKING PROBLEM.

13:58.238 --> 14:00.974
THAT WAS
BESS BEING PARANOID.
BUT THE OTHER NIGHT

14:01.074 --> 14:03.176
I'D JUST BROKEN UP
WITH MY GIRLFRIEND,

14:03.276 --> 14:05.745
MY KID WAS ACTING UP,
MY EX-WIFE SKIPPED TOWN,

14:05.845 --> 14:07.981
YOU'D SKIPPED TOWN.

14:08.081 --> 14:10.050
SHIT, WHO WOULDN'T NEED
A DRINK AFTER ALL THAT, RIGHT?

14:10.150 --> 14:14.021
ARE YOU SAYING
YOU NEEDED A DRINK?

14:17.690 --> 14:20.227
YOU KNOW, THE WEEK BEFORE
BESS WENT ON VACATION,

14:20.327 --> 14:22.829
OLIVER WAS ON HIS
BEST BEHAVIOR.

14:22.930 --> 14:25.598
THE SECOND
SHE LEFT TOWN,

14:25.698 --> 14:29.269
HE'S TURNED INTO
THIS MONSTER.

14:29.369 --> 14:32.039
IS HE TRYING TO GET
SOME KIND OF REACTION
OUT OF ME?

14:32.139 --> 14:33.907
I THINK
THAT'S PART OF IT.

14:34.007 --> 14:36.476
BUT I ALSO THINK THAT HE
WAS BEHAVING SO WELL

14:36.576 --> 14:39.146
BECAUSE HE WAS TRYING
TO GET SOME KIND OF
REACTION FROM YOU.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.348
THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

14:41.448 --> 14:43.116
WELL, LOOK AT IT FROM
OLIVER'S POINT OF VIEW.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.986
HIS FAMILY
IS BREAKING APART,

14:46.086 --> 14:48.188
SO HE PUTS A LOT
OF PRESSURE ON HIMSELF,

14:48.288 --> 14:50.323
TRYING TO BEHAVE
PERFECTLY,

14:50.423 --> 14:53.193
HOPING THAT THAT WOULD
SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.295
SO YOU'RE SAYING
HE WAS FAKING IT.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.230
IN A WAY, YEAH.

14:57.330 --> 14:58.932
I MEAN, HE EVEN TRIED
TO STOP EATING

14:59.032 --> 15:01.668
SO THAT YOU WOULDN'T BE
CONCERNED ABOUT HIS WEIGHT.

15:01.768 --> 15:03.570
HE TOLD YOU THAT?

15:03.670 --> 15:05.838
BUT IT DIDN'T WORK.

15:05.939 --> 15:08.675
HE DID EVERYTHING RIGHT,
BUT IT DIDN'T SOLVE ANY
OF THE PROBLEMS.

15:08.775 --> 15:11.811
SO NOW MAYBE
HE'S BEHAVING BADLY

15:11.911 --> 15:14.881
TO TRY AND MAKE YOU FEEL
AS BADLY AS HE FEELS.

15:14.982 --> 15:17.284
I TELL YOU, I LIKED HIM
A HELL OF A LOT BETTER

15:17.384 --> 15:19.586
WHEN HE WAS PRETENDING
TO BE HAPPY.

15:19.686 --> 15:21.989
WELL, OLIVER COULDN'T
KEEP UP THAT BEHAVIOR
FOREVER.

15:22.089 --> 15:23.923
HE HAD ME FOOLED.

15:24.024 --> 15:26.459
BESS AND I TALKED TO HIM
ABOUT THE ADOPTION,

15:26.559 --> 15:28.728
AND THAT SEEMED
TO MAKE HIM FEEL BETTER.

15:28.828 --> 15:31.198
I HONESTLY BELIEVED
HE WAS DOING WELL.

15:31.298 --> 15:34.134
WHICH IS WHAT I THINK
HE WANTED YOU TO BELIEVE.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.970
I'VE TALKED TO HIM
ABOUT THE ADOPTION TOO.

15:37.070 --> 15:40.307
AND THE WAY
HE SEES IT,

15:40.407 --> 15:43.643
BESS AND YOU WERE
FIGHTING TOO MUCH

15:43.743 --> 15:46.546
AND YOU GAVE
HIS BROTHER AWAY.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.781
AND THINGS
ARE SO DIFFICULT
FOR HIM RIGHT NOW

15:48.881 --> 15:51.218
THAT I THINK
SOMETIMES HE WISHES

15:51.318 --> 15:54.254
YOU'D GIVE
HIM AWAY TOO.

15:57.157 --> 16:00.160
DOES HE EVEN
LOVE ME?

16:00.260 --> 16:03.696
WHY WOULD YOU
SAY THAT?

16:03.796 --> 16:05.898
I DIDN'T LOVE MY DAD.

16:05.999 --> 16:08.401
NOT EVEN WHEN YOU WERE
OLIVER'S AGE?

16:08.501 --> 16:10.503
OKAY.

16:10.603 --> 16:12.405
SURE.

16:12.505 --> 16:15.342
I DID LOVE HIM BACK THEN,
BUT IT WAS UNREQUITED LOVE.

16:15.442 --> 16:18.211
YOU'LL HAVE TO EXPLAIN
THAT TO ME, LUKE.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.447
MY FATHER WAS
THE DEAN OF STUDENTS

16:20.547 --> 16:22.549
AND BASKETBALL COACH
AT MY MIDDLE SCHOOL.

16:22.649 --> 16:26.086
HE WAS IN CHARGE
OF EVERY BREATH
MY BROTHER AND I TOOK.

16:26.186 --> 16:28.355
WHEN WE DID WELL,

16:28.455 --> 16:31.124
THAT'S JUST
WHAT HE EXPECTED OF US.

16:31.224 --> 16:35.128
AND WHEN WE SCREWED UP,

16:35.228 --> 16:36.996
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY

16:37.097 --> 16:39.332
HE WAS A MAN
OF LIMITED SYMPATHY.

16:39.432 --> 16:41.668
THAT'S QUITE A LOT
TO LIVE UP TO.

16:41.768 --> 16:45.038
YOU'D THINK THAT.

16:45.138 --> 16:47.340
THE YEAR I WAS
IN THE SEVENTH GRADE,
HE STARTED TAKING

16:47.440 --> 16:50.243
LONG DRIVES ON THE WEEKENDS
BY HIMSELF.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.645
MY BROTHER AND I
GOT ON OUR BIKES

16:52.745 --> 16:56.216
AND WE RODE
AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD
LOOKING FOR HIS CAR.

16:56.316 --> 17:01.188
AND WE FOUND IT
IN THE DRIVEWAY
OF THIS LITTLE HOUSE.

17:01.288 --> 17:03.590
MY BROTHER MADE ME
RING THE BUZZER.

17:03.690 --> 17:08.695
THE DOOR OPENED,
AND THERE WAS MY FATHER'S
SECRETARY--

17:08.795 --> 17:11.464
THIS NICE LADY
WHO'D GIVE US CANDY.

17:11.564 --> 17:14.801
THEN MY DAD CAME OUT
OF HER BATHROOM

17:14.901 --> 17:17.270
AND STARTED
SCREAMING AT US.

17:17.370 --> 17:19.906
- WHAT DID YOU GUYS DO?
- WHAT COULD WE DO?

17:20.006 --> 17:22.942
WE GOT ON OUR BIKES
AND WE RODE HOME.

17:23.042 --> 17:27.580
AND THEN I WAS LYING AWAKE
THAT NIGHT IN THE BED

17:27.680 --> 17:30.183
AND I REALIZED MY FATHER'S
SECRETARY'S LIVING ROOM

17:30.283 --> 17:32.485
LOOKED EXACTLY LIKE
OUR LIVING ROOM.

17:35.488 --> 17:38.558
EVERY PIECE OF FURNITURE
WAS EXACTLY THE SAME AS OURS.

17:40.927 --> 17:43.096
HE MUST'VE BOUGHT
IT ALL FOR HER.

17:44.797 --> 17:49.336
MY BROTHER TOLD MY MOTHER
AND SHIT HIT THE FAN.

17:49.436 --> 17:52.239
SHE PACKED US UP
AND WE LEFT TOWN.

17:52.339 --> 17:53.906
WE ONLY EVER HEARD
FROM HIM

17:54.006 --> 17:56.276
WHEN WE SENT HIS CHECK
EVERY MONTH.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.111
HE WAS GOOD
ABOUT THE MONEY,

17:58.211 --> 18:01.381
I'LL GIVE HIM THAT.

18:01.481 --> 18:05.685
BUT WE DIDN'T WANT
TO SEE HIM.

18:05.785 --> 18:08.621
I MEAN, HE SURE DIDN'T WANT
TO SEE US.

18:10.823 --> 18:13.460
HE NEVER MET BESS
OR OLIVER.

18:15.295 --> 18:18.898
AND WHEN HE DIED
IT WAS LIKE A FORMALITY.

18:18.998 --> 18:22.235
BUT LATELY...

18:26.239 --> 18:29.142
IT'S LIKE
HE'S LAUGHING AT ME.

18:31.077 --> 18:33.513
I DID EVERYTHING RIGHT.

18:33.613 --> 18:36.015
I PROPOSED TO BESS
WHEN I GOT HER PREGNANT.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.518
I WORKED LIKE A DOG
TO MAKE A GOOD HOME.

18:38.618 --> 18:41.854
I NEVER RAISED A HAND
TO OLIVER.

18:44.157 --> 18:46.893
AND NOW I FEEL
LIKE I'M STANDING RIGHT
WHERE MY FATHER STOOD.

18:49.262 --> 18:51.731
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE
GETTING A DIVORCE,

18:51.831 --> 18:55.335
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU'RE TURNING INTO
YOUR FATHER.

18:55.435 --> 18:58.638
AND IT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO
LOSE YOUR SON.

19:04.611 --> 19:07.180
BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
IT FEELS LIKE I'M DOING.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.382
IT'S INEVITABLE
THAT SOMETIMES

19:09.482 --> 19:11.318
YOU'LL REMIND YOURSELF
OF YOUR FATHER.

19:11.418 --> 19:14.887
YOU SEE HOW YOU WOUND
YOUR OWN CHILDREN

19:14.987 --> 19:18.625
SO BADLY
WITHOUT EVEN TRYING.

19:19.926 --> 19:22.195
SUDDENLY YOU ALMOST
UNDERSTAND

19:22.295 --> 19:26.165
HOW HE COULD HURT YOU
THE WAY HE DID.

19:28.568 --> 19:31.638
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO
BECOME LIKE HIM.

19:31.738 --> 19:34.073
YOU'RE NOT DOOMED TO LIVE
YOUR FATHER'S LIFE.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.376
YOU HAVE A CHOICE.

19:51.090 --> 19:53.760
I THINK OUR SESSION
IS ALMOST OVER.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.929
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SAY
ANYTHING TO OLIVER
BEFORE YOU GO?

19:57.029 --> 19:59.966
YEAH, IF WE STILL
HAVE TIME.

20:00.066 --> 20:02.669
OKAY.

20:06.639 --> 20:09.809
OLIVER, DO YOU WANT
TO COME IN FOR A MINUTE?

20:15.815 --> 20:18.585
I'M SORRY YOU HAD
A BAD DAY AT SCHOOL.

20:18.685 --> 20:21.421
IT'S OKAY.

20:21.521 --> 20:24.691
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE GO GET SOME PIZZA?

20:24.791 --> 20:27.894
MAYBE CHECK OUT A MOVIE
IF THERE'S SOMETHING
GOOD PLAYING?

20:27.994 --> 20:30.397
ON A SCHOOL NIGHT?

20:31.498 --> 20:33.833
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH
ALREADY TODAY.

20:33.933 --> 20:36.503
YOU DESERVE A BREAK.

20:43.543 --> 20:46.413
SEE YOU BOTH
NEXT WEEK.

20:58.525 --> 21:00.893
( theme music playing )
