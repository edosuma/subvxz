<i> And you see the bugs</i>
<i> and you see the vans,</i>

02:05.993 --> 02:07.159
<i> and I'd like</i>
<i> something different.</i>

02:07.194 --> 02:08.393
<i> I want something</i>
<i> that stands out.</i>

02:08.429 --> 02:11.196
<i> I want something</i>
<i> that I will keep forever</i>

02:11.232 --> 02:13.098

<i> the ultimate vw convertible.</i>

02:18.405 --> 02:19.571
<i> I want it.</i>

02:19.607 --> 02:22.374
When you ask me
for the ultimate convertible,

02:22.409 --> 02:26.111
the one thing
that I can only
come up with in my mind,

02:26.147 --> 02:30.782
is, in fact, the ultimate,
rarest convertible bug
there ever was.

02:30.818 --> 02:33.886
There was a very rare
volkswagen
called a hebmuller.

02:33.921 --> 02:37.356
It was a coach builder
just outside of
the wolfsburg factory

02:37.391 --> 02:39.124
and, basically,
what they would do,

02:39.160 --> 02:40.726
is they would take
the convertible bodies,

02:40.761 --> 02:43.262
the front sections,
and they would actually

02:43.297 --> 02:44.997
put a different styled
rear end on it,

02:45.032 --> 02:47.032
it's was a
coach-built rear end.

02:47.067 --> 02:49.902
They had a hood on the back
that looked a lot
like the front hood,

02:49.937 --> 02:51.436
and it has
a very short top,

02:51.472 --> 02:54.840
instead of being
a long, you know,
sedan style top.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.008
They're super, super rare.

02:56.043 --> 02:57.743
I mean,
it's like the holy grail

02:57.778 --> 02:58.944
of volkswagens.

02:58.979 --> 03:00.412
<i> -Of volkswagens?</i>
-Yup.

03:00.447 --> 03:01.780
<i> I have to have one.</i>

03:01.815 --> 03:03.282
<i> I have two dogs</i>

03:03.317 --> 03:05.017
<i> that travel with me</i>
<i> everywhere,</i>

03:05.052 --> 03:06.251
<i> so there has to be</i>
<i> room for them.</i>

03:06.287 --> 03:08.287
<i> Not necessarily david,</i>
<i> just the dogs.</i>

03:08.322 --> 03:10.222
[all laugh]

03:10.257 --> 03:11.523
pretty sure they had
a little jump seat.

03:11.559 --> 03:13.058
I'm sure
they'd fit in the back,

03:13.093 --> 03:14.893
and then dave
can just drive his truck.

03:14.929 --> 03:17.329
[all laugh]

03:17.364 --> 03:19.398
<i>can you make it a convertible?</i>
<i> Is it a convertible?</i>

03:19.433 --> 03:21.900
They're all-- yup.
The hebmullers
are all convertibles.

03:21.936 --> 03:24.436
<i> I'm not a big fan</i>
<i> of a manual transmission,</i>

03:24.471 --> 03:27.839
<i> and I'm assuming</i>
<i> those are manual, correct?</i>

03:27.875 --> 03:31.677
Uh, yeah, they never made
an automatic on any of these.

03:31.712 --> 03:36.048
<i> If we're gonna find</i>
<i> the ultimate volkswagen,</i>
<i> why not make it my own...</i>

03:36.083 --> 03:38.283
-There you go. Absolutely.
<i> -...Volkswagen.</i>

03:38.319 --> 03:40.018
So, back in the original days
of the hebmuller,

03:40.054 --> 03:41.620
they never made an automatic,

03:41.655 --> 03:44.756
which was an option
later on in 1969 or 70.

03:44.792 --> 03:46.391
They had what they called
the autostick,

03:46.427 --> 03:47.960
but you
still had to shift the car,

03:47.995 --> 03:50.128
you just simply didn't have
to put the clutch pedal in.

03:50.164 --> 03:52.264
But, if you're wanting
an automatic,

03:52.299 --> 03:55.167
it doesn't make a lot of sense
to not do an automatic.

03:55.202 --> 03:59.605
I think that it would be
super cool to do
a resto custom hebmuller

03:59.640 --> 04:02.541
without destroying
the history of the car.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.743
<i> Yeah, I definitely wanna keep</i>
<i> the history of it</i>

04:04.778 --> 04:08.914
<i>and to be able to tell a story</i>
<i> of what exactly this is,</i>

04:08.949 --> 04:11.450
<i> because, you know,</i>
<i> if you find something</i>
<i> like that,</i>

04:11.485 --> 04:13.885
<i> you're going to pull in</i>
<i> some people that are like,</i>
<i> "what is that?"</i>

04:13.921 --> 04:15.554
-yup.
<i> -Where did it come from,</i>
<i> the history,</i>

04:15.589 --> 04:17.856
<i> -and I love</i>
<i> history stuff like that.</i>
-Yeah.

04:17.891 --> 04:19.758
[melissa]
<i> will you still be able to add</i>

04:19.793 --> 04:22.394
some of your special
custom touches to it

04:22.429 --> 04:24.529
if you're trying
to keep it more original?

04:24.565 --> 04:27.366
Are you still gonna make it
a little bit special?

04:27.401 --> 04:31.236
The resto customs,
basically, it's restored
on the outside,

04:31.272 --> 04:34.406
but all of the guts,
the engine would be upgraded,

04:34.441 --> 04:36.275
a stereo system
would be upgraded,

04:36.310 --> 04:38.277
the stance, the wheels,
all that kind of stuff.

04:38.312 --> 04:40.712
That way you keep
kind of the classic line...

04:40.748 --> 04:42.814
-Yeah.
-...And you haven't
ruined the car.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.883
Do you have
kind of an idea of colors
that you'd like to do?

04:44.918 --> 04:47.252
<i> So, I don't want</i>
<i> anything too flashy--</i>

04:47.288 --> 04:52.057
the hebmuller was the only
factory two-toned
volkswagen beetles.

04:52.092 --> 04:55.294
<i> I would keep it with that.</i>
<i> If that's what they did,</i>
<i> go with the history of it.</i>

04:55.329 --> 04:56.662
Let's see
if we can find one first,

04:56.697 --> 04:58.297
and then I'll put a design
together for you

04:58.332 --> 04:59.598
and just see what you like.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.533
You're on the mission.
Don't let me down.

05:01.568 --> 05:03.168

-You bet, guys.

<i> -Thank you.</i>

05:09.810 --> 05:11.977

and customize it.

05:12.012 --> 05:14.079
And now,
I have the opportunity.

<i> and I'm thinking kind of</i>
<i> a raspberry kind of a color.</i>

improve the wheels, stance,

08:16.163 --> 08:17.963
-Oh, look how cool it looks.
-[dave] I know.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.764
<i> -Seeing from--</i>
-[kevin]<i> and this one</i>
<i> is customized.</i>

08:19.800 --> 08:20.999
I know.

08:21.034 --> 08:21.967
Is this car for sale?

08:22.002 --> 08:23.568
<i> The black one, no.</i>
<i> They won't sell,</i>

08:23.604 --> 08:25.337
and I ain't spending
that much money on that car.

08:25.372 --> 08:27.138
The black and silver one,
I talked to that guy,

08:27.174 --> 08:29.341
<i> and that car was available,</i>

08:29.376 --> 08:30.976
<i> but I don't have</i>
<i> his information.</i>

08:31.011 --> 08:33.178
Do you know anybody
that might be able
to track down

08:33.213 --> 08:35.714
and find out who the owner
of that car was?
I didn't get his info.

08:35.749 --> 08:37.449
I think brett knows a guy

08:37.484 --> 08:39.918
-that's all into that bug crew
right there, so.
-Okay.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.486
Let me call him
and see what he can do.

08:41.522 --> 08:43.889
I mean, what do those go for?
Like 30 grand?

08:43.924 --> 08:45.657
They're six-figure cars.

08:45.692 --> 08:46.758
-Really?
-Yeah.

08:46.793 --> 08:48.059
They're volkswagens, dave!

08:48.095 --> 08:49.294
It's the rarest of the rare.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.496
This volkswagen stuff
is getting ridiculous.

08:51.532 --> 08:52.964
No, it's gonna get
even more ridiculous

08:53.000 --> 08:54.299
when we get that car, so

08:54.334 --> 08:56.034
see if you
can find the contact,

08:56.069 --> 08:57.002
-give me his info...
-Okay.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.436
...And I'm gonna see

08:58.472 --> 09:00.405
if I can wrangle
that car off of him,

09:00.440 --> 09:01.540
-and we're gonna build it.
-Okay.

09:01.575 --> 09:02.641
Remember, I'm excited.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.209
Yeah, I got it, I got it.

09:04.244 --> 09:06.478
-I got it, I got it!
-Okay, hurry up.

09:06.513 --> 09:09.214
When dave gets super excited
about a build,

09:09.249 --> 09:11.182
he's like
a kid in a candy store.

09:11.218 --> 09:13.318
It's fun to watch at first,

09:13.353 --> 09:14.953
but then reality sets in,
and you realize

09:14.988 --> 09:16.488
that you actually
have to do some work.

09:16.523 --> 09:18.156
So, now we have to find
the car,

09:18.191 --> 09:21.860
and I think
there's like, what...
100 of these left?

09:21.895 --> 09:24.963
You know what, the only time
I've ever seen a hebmuller--

09:24.998 --> 09:27.766
hebmuller, or whatever
you wanna call it,

09:27.801 --> 09:31.670
<i> we saw two at that show</i>
<i> in orange county,</i>

09:31.705 --> 09:34.873
and I think my good friend,
brett, has a connection
to one of the ones we saw.

09:35.776 --> 09:36.975
Hello.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.677
<i> -Hi!</i>
-Hi.

09:38.712 --> 09:40.412
Dave has got a customer

09:40.447 --> 09:42.647
that wants to build
a hebmuller.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.616
<i> We talked about this</i>
<i> when we were at</i>
<i> that orange county show.</i>

09:44.651 --> 09:47.085
<i> Dave was saying</i>
<i> he was interested in one</i>
<i> at one point.</i>

09:47.120 --> 09:49.254
Yeah, and I've never seen
two in one place.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.690
That one, I believe,
was for sale,

09:51.725 --> 09:53.792
and I believe
your buddy knows him.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.393
<i> Gangster money, gary bell.</i>

09:55.429 --> 09:56.361
That's what I'm talking about.

09:56.396 --> 09:57.529
So, I need to get

09:57.564 --> 09:59.431
gary bell's phone number
from you.

09:59.466 --> 10:00.699
<i> When we get done</i>
<i> having this facetime,</i>

10:00.734 --> 10:01.833
<i> I'll send you his contact.</i>

10:01.868 --> 10:03.735
I like that.
Always a pleasure to see ya.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.136
<i> Yes, it is.</i>

10:05.172 --> 10:06.304
And I'll talk to you later.

10:06.340 --> 10:08.139
<i> -It's a pleasure to see me.</i>
-All right. [laughs]

10:08.175 --> 10:09.274
<i> -bye-bye.</i>
-Later.

10:10.510 --> 10:11.776
So, after one more phone call

10:11.812 --> 10:13.445
and a couple of weeks'
worth of waiting...

10:13.480 --> 10:15.246
Ta-da!

10:15.282 --> 10:18.984
[rock music playing]

10:19.019 --> 10:21.319
[dave] it's not every day
that I get excited
about a volkswagen.

10:21.355 --> 10:22.954
-[kevin] right?
-But this is kinda
one I can get behind.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.557
I'm kinda liking
what I see in you, my friend.

10:25.592 --> 10:31.062
This is kinda cool.
1950 volkswagen
hebmuller cabrio.

10:31.098 --> 10:35.200
And I think they made 696.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.702
This one,
not sure what number,

10:37.738 --> 10:41.473
but it's one of a 123
that are in the registry
worldwide.

10:41.508 --> 10:44.075
-That's left?
-That's left...
To known to be.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.211
-Wow!
-[dave] at least,
in the registry.

10:46.246 --> 10:49.114
To have the opportunity
to drive something like this

10:49.149 --> 10:50.582
is pretty cool.

10:50.617 --> 10:53.351
To have
an even better opportunity

10:53.387 --> 10:55.453
of customizing
something like this...

10:55.489 --> 10:58.657
Restore the body
and put it on a kick-ass pan?

10:58.692 --> 11:00.859
Yup, and then I think
I'm gonna restore the pan,

11:00.894 --> 11:03.161
so that we don't ruin
the value of the car

11:03.196 --> 11:05.997
and the collectability
and the history of the car.

11:06.033 --> 11:09.801
You don't smile like that
when you're just driving
your mercedes around.

11:09.836 --> 11:13.371
Yeah, well, that's a pleasure
to drive, too,

11:13.407 --> 11:14.839
but this...

11:14.875 --> 11:16.441
I mean,
look at your smile, though,

11:16.476 --> 11:18.643
you're just like
all about it.

11:18.679 --> 11:21.913
-Dude, if you ain't got one,
get one.
-[laughs]

11:21.948 --> 11:23.848
we're just
gonna have to be
real careful with this one.

11:23.884 --> 11:27.352
We need to be very careful
to be true to what the car is

11:27.387 --> 11:29.287
-and not take away from that.
-Right, right, right.

11:29.322 --> 11:31.256
We wanna make it
more enjoyable to drive,

11:31.291 --> 11:34.092
though we definitely
need to make it
a little bit safer.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.494
Well, let's see what she's got
under the bonnet, mate.

11:36.530 --> 11:39.831
-This dude hasn't smiled
this big in forever.
-[dave laughs]

11:39.866 --> 11:41.733
I'm gonna have a hard time
and not dreaming
about this day.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.569
Hey, boys!

11:44.604 --> 11:47.539
What an amazing
little experience that was.

11:47.574 --> 11:49.374
I think that's awesome.
Because I think that,

11:49.409 --> 11:50.975
since you're
so excited about this car,

11:51.011 --> 11:52.777
maybe you should do
most of the work.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.779
I'd be fine with it
if I could actually find
the time.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.414
I'd love to do the work
on this car.

11:56.450 --> 11:57.916
Oh, but look at this.
Look at what I just found.

11:57.951 --> 11:58.850
-What's that?
-Time.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.119
[laughs]

12:01.154 --> 12:03.621
I know dave always uses
time as an excuse,

12:03.657 --> 12:05.457
but if he has time
to drive this hebmuller,

12:05.492 --> 12:07.492
at least he could give it
a once-over.

12:07.527 --> 12:09.461
-What do you think these do?
-I don't know.

12:09.496 --> 12:12.664
I have seen and worked
on thousands of cars
in my career...

12:12.699 --> 12:13.832
[sad music playing]

12:13.867 --> 12:14.899
[sighs]
...And this hebmuller is,

12:14.935 --> 12:16.701
you know,
being super rare and all,

12:16.737 --> 12:18.036
doesn't really matter.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.404
It's not like it has
some awesome feature

12:19.439 --> 12:20.672
that I've never seen before.

12:20.707 --> 12:22.173
It doesn't have
a mister fusion

12:22.209 --> 12:23.675
and it doesn't travel in time.

12:23.710 --> 12:25.610
Maybe these are headlights.

12:25.645 --> 12:27.011
-[gasps]
-[dave] ah, it's the wiper!

12:27.047 --> 12:28.313
That's the one wiper.

12:28.348 --> 12:29.447
No way!

12:29.483 --> 12:30.515
[kevin] is that the headlight?

12:30.550 --> 12:31.616
Where's the headlight switch?

12:31.651 --> 12:33.351
This car's got
a lot of buttons.

12:33.386 --> 12:36.454
You turn one on,
nothing really happens.

12:36.490 --> 12:38.223
[sighs]
I hope there's
an owner's manual.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.758
This might be
out of mine and dave's league.

12:39.793 --> 12:42.293
Off... On...

12:42.329 --> 12:44.696
Headlights, and then,
is this high beam/low beam?

12:44.731 --> 12:46.030
It ain't doing [beep].

12:47.400 --> 12:48.466
[kevin] I'll have to
figure that out.

12:51.404 --> 12:53.138
Is that the parking lights?
I'll have to figure that out.

12:53.173 --> 12:54.873
Now that we've got
the car here,
kevin and I are gonna

12:54.908 --> 12:56.741
walk around the car,
give it a once-over
and make sure

12:56.777 --> 12:58.576
that there's no big issues.

12:58.612 --> 13:00.945
What is that dim light
that I'm getting reflection
on the cowl?

13:00.981 --> 13:02.647
What is that?
Where is that coming from?

13:02.682 --> 13:04.349
Is that inside?

13:04.384 --> 13:06.484
-You see it?
I see a reflection on--
-it is!

13:06.520 --> 13:08.419
It's got a dome light
in the convertible top.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.321
I was just noticing
the reflection.
That's crazy.

13:10.357 --> 13:12.023
[dave] that's probably
what that little switch is.

13:12.058 --> 13:15.226
Hold, please.
I think we just solved
the mystery.

13:15.262 --> 13:17.829
[kevin]
is this high beam/low beam?

13:17.864 --> 13:19.230
It ain't doing [beep].

13:19.266 --> 13:20.298
[kevin]
I'll have to figure that out.

13:21.902 --> 13:24.702
-A-ha!
-[both laugh]

13:24.738 --> 13:27.071
I think kevin and I make
a pretty good
watson and holmes.

13:27.107 --> 13:29.374
Really, solving all
of the mysteries
of the universe,

13:29.409 --> 13:31.342
including that switch
on the dash.

13:32.612 --> 13:35.180
In tune in paris, stuttgart...

13:35.215 --> 13:36.815
-What else have we got there?
-Frankfurt...

13:36.850 --> 13:38.683
-Cigarette lighter.
-Look at this ashtray.

13:38.718 --> 13:42.487
-You'd have to have your game
together to ash into that.
-How do you clean it?

13:42.522 --> 13:44.722
You just pull it out,
I would think.

13:44.758 --> 13:47.926
Wow! Can you just imagine
how old this is?

13:47.961 --> 13:50.195
Think about all the things
that this ashtray has seen.

13:51.698 --> 13:54.232
If only this ash-cray-- tray
could talk.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.668
-[imitates stammering]
if only you could talk.
-If only you could talk.

13:56.703 --> 13:58.403
[both laugh]

13:58.438 --> 14:00.205
[dave]<i> for the interior,</i>
<i> we wanna do something</i>

14:00.240 --> 14:03.107
<i> that's still looks</i>
<i> like it was stock,</i>
<i>much like what we normally do.</i>

14:03.143 --> 14:05.844
<i> I might build up the bolsters</i>
<i> just a little bit</i>
<i> on the seats.</i>

14:05.879 --> 14:08.179
The rear jump seat, actually,
is gonna be really cool,

14:08.215 --> 14:10.982
because tracey and melissa,
they have little dogs,

14:11.017 --> 14:12.250
and, of course, little kids.

14:12.285 --> 14:13.818
<i> So, we're gonna make sure</i>
<i> that it's safe</i>

14:13.854 --> 14:15.520
<i> for the passengers</i>
<i> in the rear,</i>

14:15.555 --> 14:17.689
and they can only be
that tall to ride there.

14:17.724 --> 14:19.190
Open it the hood.

14:19.226 --> 14:20.391
Let's see
the business end of this.

14:20.427 --> 14:21.926
[kevin] now, wait,
is this a hood?

14:21.962 --> 14:24.462
I-- I would say it's a bonnet.

14:24.497 --> 14:26.431
I don't officially know
what you would call it, no.

14:26.466 --> 14:29.133
-Okay.
-Oh. That's a real beast.

14:29.169 --> 14:30.335
This is quite a bit different

14:30.370 --> 14:32.503
-from what we are used
to looking at.
-Yeah.

14:32.539 --> 14:35.573
The firewall is obviously
a little bit different
from a regular type 1,

14:35.609 --> 14:38.142
now this--
this is the part
that they modified.

14:38.178 --> 14:39.811
[dave] that would be the part
that they actually built

14:39.846 --> 14:41.613
specifically
for the hebmuller,

14:41.648 --> 14:45.350
and then it looks like
they used the front trunk,
or the frunk--

14:45.385 --> 14:47.085
-oh, these are from germany.
-Frankfurt would--

14:47.120 --> 14:48.720
-not from France.
-[dave laughs]

14:48.755 --> 14:50.855
these are the hood hinges
for the front,

14:50.891 --> 14:52.457
they'd use them
on the back.

14:52.492 --> 14:53.791
And then you have the prop,
that's basically

14:53.827 --> 14:55.293
the exact same one
as the front.

14:55.328 --> 14:56.895
So, it's a little bit
primitive back here

14:56.930 --> 14:57.762
is how they built that.

14:57.797 --> 14:59.864
This right here,

14:59.900 --> 15:01.666
is the gem, the jewel.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.201
-You cannot find these.
-[kevin] is this one part?

15:03.236 --> 15:04.702
[dave] there's just
so many weird things.

15:04.738 --> 15:07.605
These small tail lights,
super, super rare.

15:07.641 --> 15:10.241
This, what they call
pope nose on a beetle,

15:10.277 --> 15:11.743
this is massive.

15:11.778 --> 15:13.378
<i> There are so many parts</i>
<i> on a hebmuller</i>

15:13.413 --> 15:15.380
that are specific
to that car only

15:15.415 --> 15:17.448
and don't exist
on any other models.

15:17.484 --> 15:19.951
So, if it's missing,
or broken, or damaged,

15:19.986 --> 15:22.854
<i> could be nearly impossible</i>
<i> to replace.</i>

15:22.889 --> 15:25.323
The trim on the side,

15:25.358 --> 15:29.260
I have never witnessed
and actually looked
at real stepped trim.

15:29.296 --> 15:30.895
This has
a little detail to it.

15:30.931 --> 15:32.063
All of the other<i> vw beetles</i>

15:32.098 --> 15:33.431
that I've ever played with
and seen

15:33.466 --> 15:34.966
are just one big bull nose.

15:35.001 --> 15:37.268
Semaphores, super cool.

15:37.304 --> 15:38.770
<i> The beetle headlight,</i>
<i> this one in particular,</i>

15:38.805 --> 15:43.007
those are,
what I believe to be,
original 1950 lenses.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.342
[kevin]
they have vw's on them?

15:44.377 --> 15:46.344
[dave] yeah,
and it's got this cool oval

15:46.379 --> 15:47.879
in the fluting of the glass.

15:47.914 --> 15:49.080
That is
such a beautiful piece.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.882
I wish I could find those

15:50.917 --> 15:52.784
and put them on every one
of the beetles I ever built,

15:52.819 --> 15:54.585
but I don't know
where you would even find
something like that.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.888
[kevin] it looks like
we've got a little bit of rust
going on in here.

15:56.923 --> 15:58.456
Yeah.
It's gonna be a fun one.

15:58.491 --> 16:01.092
Can't wait to get
all of it apart,

16:01.127 --> 16:02.961
get it out, strip,
get it back here,

16:02.996 --> 16:04.529
and see
what we got to work with.

16:04.564 --> 16:07.465
Probably pretty solid.
If it was restored
in the '90s,

16:07.500 --> 16:09.567
as long as we're not dealing
with a pile of rust
when we get it back,

16:09.602 --> 16:11.602
-I think we'll be fine.
-[dave] yup.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.571
All right. Just hope
I got enough time to pitch in,

16:13.606 --> 16:15.273
because this is gonna be
a cool project.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.541
Well, if you don't,
you just remember,

16:16.576 --> 16:17.542
this is a once in a lifetime

16:17.577 --> 16:18.643
volkswagen thing.

16:18.678 --> 16:19.577
-Yeah.
-So, maybe

16:19.612 --> 16:20.778
you have
to make time in your life.

16:20.814 --> 16:22.280
I'm gonna. I'm gonna.

16:22.315 --> 16:23.481
You know, overall, this car

16:23.516 --> 16:24.882
really seems
like it's in great shape,

16:24.918 --> 16:26.417
but we won't know anything

16:26.453 --> 16:28.286
until we get the car
tore down,

16:28.321 --> 16:30.321
get it up for dip,
and get it back
and check it out.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.000
<i> The key with taking</i>
<i> any car apart,</i>

16:42.035 --> 16:44.535
and especially
a very rare car
like this hebmuller,

16:44.571 --> 16:47.271
it's important to make sure
everything is bagged, tagged,

16:47.307 --> 16:49.774
and notes are made
of anything missing, broken,

16:49.809 --> 16:52.143
or how it goes together.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.846
So far, tear down
has actually gone pretty easy,

16:54.881 --> 16:56.414
<i> and the guys looks like</i>
<i> they're having fun.</i>

16:56.449 --> 16:58.449
It's like a power wheels.

16:58.485 --> 16:59.550
We're sitting
on the back seat.

16:59.586 --> 17:01.052
Yeah, this is the only way
we can drive it.

17:01.087 --> 17:02.520
[izzy] this is what happens

17:02.555 --> 17:04.522
when you put both feet
in one shoe.

17:04.557 --> 17:07.225
-Like, that's
what it look like.
-[all laugh]

17:07.260 --> 17:09.861
look, ma,
I'm in a volkswagen--

17:09.896 --> 17:11.896
-it's comfortable.
-It's not bad.

17:11.931 --> 17:13.331
-Yeah.
-I didn't even sit back
all the way.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.967
[upbeat music playing]

17:25.145 --> 17:27.311
tear down
was going super smooth.

17:27.347 --> 17:28.546
<i> No surprises.</i>

17:28.581 --> 17:29.781
And then we got to this.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.849
[whirring]

17:33.053 --> 17:35.620
I would never have expected
in a million years

17:35.655 --> 17:37.188
that we'd be seeing
what we're seeing.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.023
<i> They've actually</i>
<i> made a piece of metal</i>

17:39.059 --> 17:40.258
<i> that has been welded</i>

17:40.293 --> 17:43.728
from the floor pan
to the rocker.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.963
I've never seen
anything like it in my life.

17:45.999 --> 17:49.500
This bead
should go all the way
down to the pan,

17:49.536 --> 17:51.402
but you can tell
it stops right here,

17:51.438 --> 17:54.939
and this is a big old well
that's run all the way
along here.

17:54.974 --> 17:56.240
[kevin]
<i> come to find out, the people</i>

17:56.276 --> 17:57.942
<i> that restored</i>
<i> this car in the '90s</i>

17:57.977 --> 17:59.911
put in a little extra metal
for us.

17:59.946 --> 18:01.145
Thanks, guys.

18:01.181 --> 18:03.781
So, the body
is welded to the pan,

18:03.817 --> 18:05.750
<i> which is normally</i>
<i> not how it is,</i>

18:05.785 --> 18:07.151

18:07.187 --> 18:08.486
<i> that I'm not</i>
<i> super happy about.</i>

18:08.521 --> 18:09.921
<i> So, we're gonna go through,</i>

18:09.956 --> 18:11.989
<i> and we're gonna cut the body</i>
<i> loose from the pan.</i>

18:12.025 --> 18:14.625
<i> Hopefully, we can find</i>
<i> all the places</i>
<i> that they did get welded.</i>

18:14.661 --> 18:16.360
[dave]<i> after a lot of cutting,</i>

18:16.396 --> 18:19.030
they finally got the body
separated from the pan.

18:19.065 --> 18:20.865
Who the hell does that?

18:20.900 --> 18:22.533
With any car that you buy,

18:22.569 --> 18:25.970
you can always end up
or expect to find some rust

18:26.005 --> 18:29.373
<i> or some ill repairs</i>
<i> along the way</i>
<i> in the lifetime of the car.</i>

18:29.409 --> 18:32.910
<i> This one, in particular,</i>
<i> holy smokes!</i>

18:32.946 --> 18:34.445
<i> So, we're gonna go ahead</i>
<i> and send this up north</i>

18:34.481 --> 18:35.780
and have them
chemically dip it.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.915
[rock music playing]

18:45.225 --> 18:47.325
the hebmuller parts
are finally back from dip,

18:47.360 --> 18:50.528
and we're finally
getting a clear picture
on this car's life.

18:50.563 --> 18:53.064
<i> I hope</i>
<i> dave will still be smiling</i>
<i> when he sees what's going on.</i>

18:58.171 --> 19:00.271
How's the weather up north?

19:00.306 --> 19:02.473
[bo] it's been
actually really nice.

19:14.554 --> 19:16.053
We got everything unloaded.

19:16.089 --> 19:18.689
I'm just praying there's no
unpleasant surprises.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.291
So, the hebmuller is back.

19:20.326 --> 19:23.027
Any crazy things
that you found?

19:23.062 --> 19:26.297
We didn't know the front end
had been smashed in.

19:26.332 --> 19:30.535
[kevin] [beep]!

19:30.570 --> 19:33.171
Dave may not wanna hear
what I have to say.

19:33.206 --> 19:35.573
Any crazy things
that you found?

19:35.608 --> 19:39.744
We didn't know the front end
had been smashed in
like it had been.

19:39.779 --> 19:43.548
And then we found
someone had filled
the rockers with spray foam.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.683
Oh, that's always good.
All that water in there.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.485
-Yeah, exactly.
-[kevin laughs]

19:47.520 --> 19:49.687
the rear section
seems decently clean.

19:49.722 --> 19:51.522
-It's really nice.
-There's been a little bit
of work here,

19:51.558 --> 19:54.258
but it doesn't look like it's,
like, been crashed really bad,

19:54.294 --> 19:56.561
-which is nice.
-It's pretty nice.

19:56.596 --> 19:58.362
-[bo] and the panels
are really nice.
-[kevin] yeah.

19:58.398 --> 20:00.364
There's definitely
more work here
than we had hoped for,

20:00.400 --> 20:02.266
but the best team
is on the case.

20:02.302 --> 20:04.569
So, explain to me
the process a little bit.

20:04.604 --> 20:07.305
Well, you know,
everyone is different.
Just-- you guys know that.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.740
This one we knew
had a lot of filler on it.

20:09.776 --> 20:10.975
We ground down a little bit--

20:11.010 --> 20:12.610
how many layers
are we looking at?

20:12.645 --> 20:14.612
That gives us an idea
of what it's gonna take.

20:14.647 --> 20:18.349
And the biggest step is
we cook the part
at over 200 degrees

20:18.384 --> 20:22.253
<i> for 48-72 hours,</i>
<i> and in some cases, longer.</i>

20:22.288 --> 20:25.423
<i> Amazingly, the body</i>
<i> only took the weekend.</i>

20:25.458 --> 20:27.091
-[kevin]<i> oh, okay.</i>
<i> -So we cooked it three days.</i>

20:27.126 --> 20:29.660
-The parts, however,
took about two weeks.
-Wow!

20:29.696 --> 20:32.230
And then, so, once it's cooked
and then cleaned,

20:32.265 --> 20:34.465
<i> -and then, does it come out</i>
<i> just looking like this?</i>
-[bo]<i> no, no.</i>

20:34.500 --> 20:37.201
-[kevin laughs]
<i> -not by any means.</i>

20:37.237 --> 20:40.271
<i> No, it comes out,</i>
<i> and most all the material</i>
<i> is still on there,</i>

20:40.306 --> 20:42.273
<i> -but it's loose.</i>
-[kevin]<i> okay.</i>

20:42.308 --> 20:44.976
<i> And then it's</i>
<i> high pressure fresh water</i>
<i> to blow it all off,</i>

20:45.011 --> 20:48.312
<i> clean all the seams,</i>
<i> get everything off</i>
<i> that we can.</i>

20:48.348 --> 20:52.817
-And of course, we knew
how delicate these parts are.
-Right.

20:52.852 --> 20:55.286
So, we're like
just give it
a little wash down,

20:55.321 --> 20:57.989
<i> cook it some more.</i>
<i> Wash it, cook it.</i>

20:58.024 --> 20:59.690
[kevin]<i> yeah. You know,</i>
<i> ever since we started</i>

20:59.726 --> 21:01.492
having you do this
to get our cars cleaned,

21:01.527 --> 21:03.327
I don't think we could ever
go anywhere back.

21:03.363 --> 21:05.029
<i> They come out,</i>
<i> they're clean.</i>

21:05.064 --> 21:06.163
<i> You know, you never</i>
<i> have to worry</i>

21:06.199 --> 21:07.498
<i> about any warpage</i>
<i> to the panels</i>

21:07.533 --> 21:09.800
<i> from the heat of the--</i>
<i> of like a blaster.</i>

21:09.836 --> 21:13.104
-And that's it.
It's a non-abrasive process.
-Right.

21:13.139 --> 21:15.339
In the blasting process,
you know, you're getting
through the paint,

21:15.375 --> 21:18.209
<i> and as soon as you get</i>
<i> through the paint,</i>
<i> now you're hitting the metal</i>

21:18.244 --> 21:21.145
-and you're basically taking
a layer of that metal off.
-Absolutely.

21:21.180 --> 21:23.547
It may be small,
but like I said,
in cases like this,

21:23.583 --> 21:25.850
we need to save
every little piece
that we can.

21:25.885 --> 21:27.251
It's so important.

21:27.287 --> 21:28.386
Well, I appreciate it.

21:28.421 --> 21:29.720
You did a killer job,
like always.

21:29.756 --> 21:31.055
I'll let you know
when I get the next one.

21:31.090 --> 21:32.390
-Great. Thank you.
-Thanks, buddy.

21:32.425 --> 21:33.658
Take it easy. Travel safe.

21:33.693 --> 21:35.226
[kevin]<i> there's definitely</i>
<i> some parts on this car</i>

21:35.261 --> 21:37.028
<i> that are going to need</i>
<i> to be replaced.</i>

21:37.063 --> 21:39.730
Lucky for us,
they're the ones
we can actually find.

21:39.766 --> 21:41.932
Some of these parts
are impossible.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.868
They're never
gonna be reproduced.

21:43.903 --> 21:46.170
<i> This is an incredibly</i>
<i> rare volkswagen,</i>

21:46.205 --> 21:49.507
<i> so, what we're going to do</i>
<i> is we're going to restore</i>
<i> the original pan</i>

21:49.542 --> 21:52.176
back to stock, stock engine,
stock everything,

21:52.211 --> 21:54.979
and then we're gonna get
an irs pan and hotrod it.

21:55.014 --> 21:57.882
And we're actually gonna take
the body unharmed,
fully restored,

21:57.917 --> 21:59.984
put it on this hotrod pan,

22:00.019 --> 22:01.585
and it's
the best of both worlds.

22:01.621 --> 22:05.189
Now, we're gonna save
this, the front,
this whole tunnel,

22:05.224 --> 22:09.560
and then the rear section.
So, basically,
everywhere your feet go

22:09.595 --> 22:11.462
is what's gonna be replaced.

22:11.497 --> 22:13.698
<i> Start drilling out</i>
<i> all the holes,</i>

22:13.733 --> 22:15.800
<i> cut it out and start putting</i>
<i> the new stuff in right away.</i>

22:15.835 --> 22:17.702
[rock music playing]

22:17.737 --> 22:19.970
[kevin]
<i> since we are restoring</i>
<i> this body,</i>

22:20.006 --> 22:22.406
it's a little tedious,
drilling all these spot welds.

22:22.442 --> 22:25.676
We wanna make it look
as original as it can.

22:34.053 --> 22:35.086
[daniel] there we go.

22:37.323 --> 22:39.724
[kevin]<i> the flanges</i>
<i> where the floor pans</i>
<i> are spot welded</i>

22:39.759 --> 22:41.325
<i> have some surface rust,</i>
<i> and they need</i>
<i> to be addressed.</i>

22:44.564 --> 22:45.730
I don't know who's winning.

22:45.765 --> 22:47.465
I think
we're in the same place.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.166
[whirring]

23:01.547 --> 23:03.280
[dave]<i> with the pan halves</i>
<i> going back in together</i>

23:03.316 --> 23:06.217
<i> and all the repairs made</i>
<i> to the center sections</i>
<i> of these chassis,</i>

23:06.252 --> 23:08.652
we're gonna put
a weld thru primer
on these areas

23:08.688 --> 23:10.388
to ensure that we have no rust

23:10.423 --> 23:12.323
<i> sneaking back through</i>
<i> once it's all finished.</i>

23:12.358 --> 23:13.958
[daniel]<i> 'cause that's</i>
<i> where the rust was building,</i>

23:13.993 --> 23:16.861
<i> so, they just put</i>
<i> a weld thru primer</i>
<i> on top of it.</i>

23:16.896 --> 23:18.562
So, when we stack
the other one,
we don't just make it work.

23:21.701 --> 23:23.968
[kevin]<i> I don't know</i>
<i> who got done first,</i>
<i> ira or daniel.</i>

23:24.003 --> 23:27.171
The most important part is
they're both done
and they look amazing.

23:27.206 --> 23:29.306
<i> We're gonna set it up</i>
<i> on this hotrod chassis.</i>

23:29.342 --> 23:31.609
It's gonna have a big engine,
it's gonna be really cool
to drive.

23:31.644 --> 23:33.444
But if somebody
ever ends up with this car

23:33.479 --> 23:35.546
and wants to go back
to the original,

23:35.581 --> 23:38.649
we have the pan for you.
We've restored it completely.

23:38.684 --> 23:41.485
You could unbuild the body,
put it right over
on the original pan.

23:41.521 --> 23:44.588
I'm just test fitting
before I do drill the holes

23:44.624 --> 23:46.624
and see
if I gotta trim anything,

23:46.659 --> 23:49.059
'cause I'll just put holes
on the perimeter.

23:49.095 --> 23:51.128
So I don't wanna put
all the holes
and have to cut it off

23:51.164 --> 23:52.530
and have half a hole
here and there.

23:52.565 --> 23:54.098
It's looking
like it's kinda long.

23:54.133 --> 23:56.967
It is always better
to be too long than too short.

23:57.003 --> 23:59.203
<i> Cutting off material</i>
<i> is relatively easy,</i>

23:59.238 --> 24:02.072

a little bit more complex.

[rock music playing]

24:11.784 --> 24:13.451
I guess that's it.

[dave]<i> kevin and I</i>
<i>have a great way of installing</i>

24:18.891 --> 24:20.224
So, before daniel
gets too far,

24:20.259 --> 24:21.859
we wanna share
that information.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.961
You're a-- yeah.

-You're, uh...
-[daniel] tired?

24:25.731 --> 24:27.665
No, not yet.

24:27.700 --> 24:29.400
If you put it
in the wrong place,
you will be.

24:29.435 --> 24:32.303
We do have one thing, though.

24:32.338 --> 24:35.372
We want you
to put them up there
and get them packed,

24:35.408 --> 24:38.242
and then I want
to stack the body up there.

24:38.277 --> 24:41.445
Line these holes up,
front and rear on the body,

24:41.481 --> 24:44.381
and then fit this back
across the back
where it goes.

24:44.417 --> 24:46.383
[daniel]
well, I can put it on there
with self tappers in.

24:46.419 --> 24:47.852
Yeah. Yeah,
that would be fine too.

24:47.887 --> 24:49.520
We just wanna double check
and make sure,

24:49.555 --> 24:51.689
because you're using
an irs pan,

24:51.724 --> 24:54.458
we can assume
that it's gonna fit just fine.

24:54.494 --> 24:57.361
Kevin's recollecting that
I've never actually
put the body back on

24:57.396 --> 24:58.729
and actually fit these,

24:58.764 --> 25:01.131
before I just put them
in place. He's right.

25:01.167 --> 25:02.933
I never have,
I've been very lucky.

25:02.969 --> 25:04.301
But I've wallowed
a lot of holes...

25:04.337 --> 25:05.669
-[kevin] I was gonna say--
-[all laugh]

25:05.705 --> 25:06.971
I was like, I just thought

25:07.006 --> 25:08.472
we just put
pan outs on these things.

25:08.508 --> 25:10.608
Then you just--
and they always
just lined up.

25:10.643 --> 25:12.643
I didn't know
you had to wallow
all these holes.

25:12.678 --> 25:14.211
Get it in place,

25:14.247 --> 25:15.579
and then make sure
that this is good.

25:15.615 --> 25:17.581
Front to back and in and out
before you weld it.

25:17.617 --> 25:20.217
It's good to learn
from other people's mistakes.

25:20.253 --> 25:22.086
In this case, it was dave's.
[laughs]

25:22.121 --> 25:24.788
<i> we will definitely</i>
<i> be test fitting it</i>
<i>before drilling any new holes.</i>

25:24.824 --> 25:27.124
This side is
all set in place, trimmed,

25:27.159 --> 25:30.628
and just
self tappered in for now,
so we could test the body.

25:30.663 --> 25:32.029
Just got to catch up this one

25:32.064 --> 25:33.697
<i> and then grab some people</i>

25:33.733 --> 25:35.132
<i> and set the body</i>
<i> on this thing.</i>

25:38.538 --> 25:40.504
[clunking]

25:40.540 --> 25:42.206
[whirring]

25:42.241 --> 25:43.507
I wanna test fit the body

25:43.543 --> 25:45.543
on the custom frame
before we get too far

25:45.578 --> 25:48.178
to see what kind
of modifications
we may have to make.

25:48.214 --> 25:50.881
Okay, so front corners.
We're just gonna walk it over.

25:50.917 --> 25:53.183
Why is there three of you
on that side
and me of me on this side?

25:53.219 --> 25:54.852
[grunts] ...Uh, nothing.

25:56.455 --> 25:57.521
Watch your back.

25:57.557 --> 25:58.689
[dave] is this light,

25:58.724 --> 26:00.024
or are you carrying
the whole thing?

26:00.059 --> 26:00.891
[daniel] I work out.

26:01.894 --> 26:03.627
[groaning]

26:03.663 --> 26:05.930
I knew you'd try to
sabotage mine.

26:05.965 --> 26:08.632
Fellas, we're going too fast.
Go forward a little bit.
Forward.

26:08.668 --> 26:10.701
It's very important
to all of us to make sure

26:10.736 --> 26:13.404
that the body fits,
obviously, both chassis.

26:13.439 --> 26:14.572
Down.

26:14.607 --> 26:17.508
Down. Go that way.

26:17.543 --> 26:19.877
[daniel] now we're hitting
on the inner well right here.

26:21.314 --> 26:24.014
Go that way.

26:24.050 --> 26:26.250
[daniel] now we're hitting
on the inner well right here.

26:26.285 --> 26:29.486
We're test fitting
a hebmuller body
on a modern chassis,

26:29.522 --> 26:31.822
and, right now, it looks like
the only place
it's hitting hard

26:31.857 --> 26:33.324
is those shock mounts.

26:33.359 --> 26:34.925
Get it jacked up, let's drill
those spot welds out

26:34.961 --> 26:36.827
and hang on to those mounts.

26:36.862 --> 26:38.062
Let's go ahead
and move it back.

26:38.097 --> 26:39.296
We need to do
a little bit of massage

26:39.332 --> 26:41.098
on that cast needed for
the shock mount,

26:41.133 --> 26:42.766
for the upper shock mount.
Do that.

26:42.802 --> 26:44.168
And then, yeah, just wiggle
it around up front,

26:44.203 --> 26:45.269
it should drop in.

26:45.304 --> 26:46.904
We can hotrod the pan.

26:46.939 --> 26:49.139
We just wanna do
the least amount damage

26:49.175 --> 26:51.308
to the original body.

26:51.344 --> 26:53.110
Here's the thing
that I look at.

26:53.145 --> 26:55.012
Chopping the hell out of it
and doing all sorts of stuff,

26:55.047 --> 26:56.347
being silly about it,

26:56.382 --> 26:57.881
is still keeping it

26:57.917 --> 27:00.184
to where the car
is being used.

27:00.219 --> 27:01.952
It's not just being looked at.

27:01.988 --> 27:05.289
A restored car
is so expensive, so valuable,

27:05.324 --> 27:06.857
and not fun to drive--

27:06.892 --> 27:07.925
I had fun
driving this, actually.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.126
I don't know why
I lied about that,

27:09.161 --> 27:10.461
but you're still
saving the car

27:10.496 --> 27:11.862
by making it
to where somebody

27:11.897 --> 27:13.530
wants to actually get in
and drive it and use it.

27:13.566 --> 27:14.832
[rock music playing]

27:14.867 --> 27:15.899
<i> and now that we can see</i>

27:15.935 --> 27:17.034
<i> how the body's gonna fit</i>

27:17.069 --> 27:17.935
on this new chassis,

27:17.970 --> 27:19.403
it's time to make
some modifications.

27:19.438 --> 27:20.771
<i> We're gonna replace</i>
<i> all of the areas</i>

27:20.806 --> 27:22.406
<i> that we can tell</i>
<i> have rusted through,</i>

27:22.441 --> 27:23.807
<i> starting with the rockers.</i>

27:23.843 --> 27:25.542
[rock music playing]

27:25.578 --> 27:27.845
that part sucked,
and that was the easy part.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.179
Rust behind rust.

27:29.215 --> 27:30.614
Just trying
to test fit this piece,

27:30.650 --> 27:32.816
because it gets bolted
to the pan.

27:32.852 --> 27:35.052
Wanna make sure
that it's actually fitting
in the car before we do it.

27:39.258 --> 27:40.624
For the most part,
these fit pretty good.

27:40.660 --> 27:43.027
Most of this stuff
gets built around this,

27:43.062 --> 27:45.129
so, I'd rather
cleco that guy in.

27:45.164 --> 27:48.499
<i> And then build it</i>
<i> all around it,</i>
<i> and then pop it back out.</i>

27:48.534 --> 27:51.201
Finding some spray foam
in the cavities of these cars,

27:51.237 --> 27:52.903
<i> we just need to cut</i>
<i> things out and remove them.</i>

27:52.938 --> 27:55.105
[clanging]

27:55.141 --> 27:56.774
the rockers
on this car are shot,

27:56.809 --> 27:58.609
and so
are the convertible supports.

27:58.644 --> 28:00.377
<i> So, we're gonna have daniel</i>
<i> fab up a brand-new set,</i>

28:00.413 --> 28:01.278
<i> and get them installed.</i>

28:22.001 --> 28:24.034
[dave]<i> we've replaced</i>
<i> all of the rusty parts</i>

28:24.070 --> 28:27.805
with brand-new
reproduction parts
that are really nice pieces,

28:27.840 --> 28:30.674
but we got to ensure
that everything's gonna fit
all at the same time.

28:30.710 --> 28:33.010
[daniel] both pans are done.

28:33.045 --> 28:35.579
So, test fitting both pans,
make sure they both align,

28:35.614 --> 28:37.214
and we got to make
each pan line up
with all the holes,

28:37.249 --> 28:38.615
so, that way,
they can be interchangeable

28:38.651 --> 28:40.317
if someone
were to swap it out.

28:42.455 --> 28:44.788
<i> Got the majority</i>
<i> of the stuff that I can build</i>

28:44.824 --> 28:45.923
all beaded
and welded in.

28:45.958 --> 28:48.225
So, all the rust repair so far

28:48.260 --> 28:50.527
is done
on the internal stuff.

28:50.563 --> 28:52.563
It's all the heating tubes
and the rockers are in.

28:52.598 --> 28:54.732
So, just waiting on parts now.

28:54.767 --> 28:57.334
They make good replica fenders
for the early volkswagens,

28:57.369 --> 28:59.703
but you have to look
in the right corner
of the world to find them.

29:10.850 --> 29:12.616
The new front clip
has finally arrived,

29:12.651 --> 29:15.018
and we got
frank working on the mock-up.

29:15.054 --> 29:18.122
[frank]<i> we've got</i>
<i> new pieces here, tested</i>
<i> on the front of the car.</i>

29:18.157 --> 29:22.059
<i> I mean, you've got a, what,</i>
<i> 60, 70-year old car here</i>
<i> with old metal from germany</i>

29:22.094 --> 29:23.927
that's been beat around
for a long time.

29:23.963 --> 29:26.563
<i> So, it's hard to take</i>
<i> new stuff aftermarket.</i>

29:26.599 --> 29:29.767
Some of these parts are made
in different countries
that we got them from, too,

29:29.802 --> 29:32.302
<i> and try and fit them in</i>
<i> and make them all</i>
<i> work together.</i>

29:32.338 --> 29:34.571
Aftermarket
never fits exactly perfect.

29:34.607 --> 29:37.975
<i> You don't wanna spend all day</i>
<i>chasing down one little thing.</i>

29:38.010 --> 29:40.410
<i> You have to see</i>
<i> how everything fits</i>
<i> relative to the other part.</i>

29:40.446 --> 29:42.112
<i> The odds</i>
<i> are always against you</i>

29:42.148 --> 29:43.914
<i> for it to fit good</i>
<i> the first time.</i>

29:43.949 --> 29:46.350
Do a rough test fit
on this hood.

29:46.385 --> 29:48.485
Got it aligned here,

29:48.521 --> 29:51.054
and you can see
how much it's arching there.

29:51.090 --> 29:53.023
Is it the nose of the hood
that's curled in

29:53.058 --> 29:55.425
from getting wrecked,
or something?

29:55.461 --> 29:57.928
Or could it be
this lower valance?

29:57.963 --> 30:00.330
I'm gonna pull this off
and see what happens.

30:04.136 --> 30:07.137
Now let's see what happens.

30:07.173 --> 30:08.338
You can see,
with this removed,

30:08.374 --> 30:10.774
you know, if that was causing
this to touch,

30:10.810 --> 30:13.343
or something,
but it's out of the way.

30:13.379 --> 30:15.145
We're running into
the same issue here where,

30:15.181 --> 30:18.649
really, from nearly
the entire back to here,

30:18.684 --> 30:21.218
it's just raised up
above this line.

30:21.253 --> 30:24.988
It's a fight versus
aftermarket reproduction
panels here

30:25.024 --> 30:27.257
against an original.

30:27.293 --> 30:29.560
It would have been nice
if this would have fit
perfectly to that, and then

30:29.595 --> 30:31.261
all we had to do
was tweak this a little bit.

30:31.297 --> 30:33.263
Let's try the fenders and
see what those look like.

30:33.299 --> 30:35.465
Hopefully, something fits
without needing
significant modification.

30:37.403 --> 30:39.269
Looking under here,
I can see, definitely,

30:39.305 --> 30:40.571
there's a misalignment.

30:44.176 --> 30:48.579
These are the sem--
semi-fours...

30:48.614 --> 30:51.815
I don't know how you say it.
Semafours, semifours...

30:51.851 --> 30:54.251
It's pronounced semaphores.

30:54.286 --> 31:00.023
Turn signals
for the volkswagen...
Ah, for the hebmuller.

31:00.059 --> 31:02.359
Sema, meaning partial,

31:02.394 --> 31:03.594
an
and one more than three.

31:05.130 --> 31:06.463
And it's a turn signal.

31:06.498 --> 31:08.999
[izzy] these buckets
house the signal.

31:09.034 --> 31:12.536
We're gonna install them
into the new fenders on this.

31:12.571 --> 31:16.106
And these are actually
supposed to be mounted
flush in the car.

31:16.141 --> 31:17.341
I'm going to be
cutting out

31:17.376 --> 31:20.444
all of this surrounding
metal here,

31:20.479 --> 31:22.145
clean them up
as best I can,

31:22.181 --> 31:24.281
'cause, as far as I know,
we can't get these.

31:36.395 --> 31:39.096
Izzy has
the semaphores buckets
prepped and ready for the car.

31:39.131 --> 31:40.564
Now he just need to
cut the hole and make sure

31:40.599 --> 31:42.366
that the edges are smooth
for a great weld.

31:50.342 --> 31:53.076
So now, I have that.

31:53.112 --> 31:56.480
I'll just grab
the measurements
that I was given.

31:56.515 --> 32:00.217
And... It's over there.

32:00.252 --> 32:02.886
I kind of just try to eyeball
where the contour
is gonna match.

32:04.323 --> 32:05.555
I think right about there.

32:05.591 --> 32:07.291
Somewhere in there.

32:07.326 --> 32:09.826
Izzy needs to put
a little curve
or a little shape

32:09.862 --> 32:11.361
<i> into the semaphore buckets,</i>

32:11.397 --> 32:13.497
<i> so they will match</i>
<i> the front quarter panels.</i>

32:17.036 --> 32:21.438
[izzy] we are finally
starting to put the semaphores
in the car.

32:21.473 --> 32:25.676
Normally, we would have this,
like, trimmed piece
that we would--

32:25.711 --> 32:29.313
you know, we'd like graft this
in the side of the fender,
like that,

32:29.348 --> 32:31.381
and then we're gonna hammer
and dolly it all the way
around the fender

32:31.417 --> 32:32.516
so that it's all flat.

32:32.551 --> 32:36.253
But, yeah, we like to
do things the interesting way.

32:36.288 --> 32:39.056
So, these are put
in the fenders
before they're put on,

32:39.091 --> 32:40.657
so, basically now,
what we're trying to do

32:40.693 --> 32:43.727
is adapt the buckets
that would go
on the backside

32:43.762 --> 32:45.929
and attach it to this flange,

32:45.965 --> 32:49.099
and we're just gonna kinda
get them right on the face
of this panel,

32:49.134 --> 32:50.801
and just get
a good edge weld on it.

32:50.836 --> 32:52.402
This thing
is kind of sticking out.

32:52.438 --> 32:54.304
You can see it.
It sticks out past the body.

32:54.340 --> 32:55.772
We're just trying
to get these set

32:55.808 --> 32:58.208
in a super
comfortable position,

32:58.243 --> 33:01.044
knowing that we can take
these back in

33:01.080 --> 33:04.681
to fine tune them against
the body right here
that's all done.

33:04.717 --> 33:06.450
There's a couple of tabs
in there,

33:06.485 --> 33:08.819
and you can manipulate
those tabs a little bit.

33:08.854 --> 33:12.656
This tab right here,
I can manipulate
that tab as well.

33:12.691 --> 33:14.191
That brings it down.

33:29.608 --> 33:30.907
[dave]
<i> it took a little finessing,</i>

33:30.943 --> 33:33.243
but in the end,
the semaphores fit perfect.

33:33.278 --> 33:35.379
It's one of those things
that kinda like

33:35.414 --> 33:38.115
makes the character
of the vehicle.
These old bugs,

33:38.150 --> 33:40.884
what's not cool
about a turn signal
that flips out like that?

33:40.919 --> 33:42.386
Boop, goes down.
[laughs]

33:42.421 --> 33:43.520
yeah, I really dig them.

33:48.427 --> 33:51.795
Looking under here,
I can see definitely
there's a misalignment

33:51.830 --> 33:54.664
with the holes
that are already drilled
on the fender

33:54.700 --> 33:57.567
in comparison
to the inner fender well.

33:57.603 --> 33:59.770
I think these ones
are from, like, columbia
or south america,

33:59.805 --> 34:01.238
and those ones
are from europe,

34:01.273 --> 34:03.106
so, you got
different manufacturers

34:03.142 --> 34:06.510
reproducing something
from a 70-year-old car, and...

34:06.545 --> 34:08.278
Trying to make it all work.

34:08.313 --> 34:10.080
The holes look better
on this one.

34:10.115 --> 34:11.548
Let's get it tightened up
and see what happens.

34:14.153 --> 34:15.852
That's a pretty good fit.

34:15.888 --> 34:17.154
It's coming away
a little bit there,

34:17.189 --> 34:18.355
but I think

34:18.390 --> 34:20.891
one of those holes
wouldn't go through.

34:20.926 --> 34:22.592
Concerned about this, though.

34:22.628 --> 34:23.960
I dunno why it's doing that.

34:23.996 --> 34:25.562
I hope I can make
a simple adjustment,

34:25.597 --> 34:26.830
and this gap will go away.

34:26.865 --> 34:29.366
We go from the front edge
of this, across,

34:29.401 --> 34:31.201
I'm seeing it,
two and an eighth.

34:32.404 --> 34:33.703
Front edge of this one,

34:33.739 --> 34:35.772
that's only
an inch and a quarter.

34:35.808 --> 34:37.274
So, that's actually way in

34:37.309 --> 34:39.843
and that would explain
why that hole isn't lining up.

34:39.878 --> 34:41.812
This has gotta come out
a little bit.

34:41.847 --> 34:43.246
Now, that's much better.

34:43.282 --> 34:45.482
Probably need to get
that other panel back on,

34:45.517 --> 34:46.383
and now try the hood out,

34:46.418 --> 34:47.884
and then figure out

34:47.920 --> 34:49.319
how I'm gonna get
that hood to fit.

34:52.157 --> 34:53.557
Even with the other panel on,

34:53.592 --> 34:54.925
it still doesn't look
like things are fitting

34:54.960 --> 34:55.992
the way they should be.

34:56.028 --> 34:56.993
It's never easy.

34:57.830 --> 34:59.596
Never easy.

34:59.631 --> 35:01.331
All right, let's do
something different,

35:01.366 --> 35:02.799
so I don't get
pissed off on that.

35:02.835 --> 35:03.967
[laughs]
let's put the hood on it.

35:07.339 --> 35:09.639
The same game as before.
We know it's touching,

35:09.675 --> 35:11.241
but are we hanging over?

35:11.276 --> 35:13.110
Pretty good on the left side,

35:13.145 --> 35:16.613
but it's definitely
hanging over the fender here
on this side.

35:16.648 --> 35:17.747
You can see a crease here.

35:17.783 --> 35:19.216
The hood
might have got a hit,

35:19.251 --> 35:20.717
and it might be bringing
that line out.

35:20.752 --> 35:22.552
Looks like
it's even hanging over

35:22.588 --> 35:23.854
a little bit on this side.

35:23.889 --> 35:25.655
So, if it's hanging over
there and there,

35:25.691 --> 35:27.491
twist it...

35:27.526 --> 35:30.560
Do I chase the issue
with the fender?

35:30.596 --> 35:32.028
Do I fix the hood?

35:32.064 --> 35:34.331
It would be really easy
with the fenders

35:34.366 --> 35:37.801
to start correcting
the whole alignment,

35:37.836 --> 35:39.669
and that just may be
all I need to do.

35:39.705 --> 35:41.271
And that will fit
pretty good then.

35:41.306 --> 35:44.307
I could play
with this after.

35:44.343 --> 35:45.942
I'm just gonna move it
for now.

35:48.780 --> 35:50.647
<i> After a few minor adjustments</i>
<i> on the front clip, though,</i>

35:50.682 --> 35:52.048
<i> things are fitting</i>
<i> a lot better.</i>

35:52.084 --> 35:53.517
We're getting
towards the end

35:53.552 --> 35:55.385
of the major metal work
on this hebmuller,

35:55.420 --> 35:57.053
but now it's time
to start addressing the hood.

35:57.089 --> 35:58.889
We've got three hoods.

35:58.924 --> 36:01.324
We've got dave's hood,
which we can't screw up,

36:01.360 --> 36:04.094
but it's a good template
for us to be able to mark off

36:04.129 --> 36:05.996
what actually
the hood should look like.

36:06.031 --> 36:08.932
We've got the yellow hood
that I've got mostly straight,

36:08.967 --> 36:11.601
<i> getting it flattened</i>
<i> to kinda fit the contour</i>
<i> of the body,</i>

36:11.637 --> 36:13.770
<i> and then I had to work out</i>
<i> some dents on it.</i>

36:13.805 --> 36:15.839
So, we're gonna take parts
and brackets and pieces

36:15.874 --> 36:18.508
from the early hood
that was on the car

36:18.544 --> 36:20.844
and actually graft it
onto a better skin,

36:20.879 --> 36:23.613
<i> but, on that skin, we also</i>
<i> have some major damage,</i>

36:23.649 --> 36:27.150
so, we're gonna build
the entire front ten inches
of that. By hand.

36:27.186 --> 36:30.320
Dave's going through
and actually creating
a whole new nose piece.

36:30.355 --> 36:32.522
<i> At the same time,</i>
<i> I'm removing</i>

36:32.558 --> 36:34.224
the hinge
and support structure
from the hood.

36:34.259 --> 36:36.092
This is
the original factory hood.

36:36.128 --> 36:38.295
This structure
needs to actually go

36:38.330 --> 36:40.764
on the newer hood
that we're putting
onto the car,

36:40.799 --> 36:42.032
pull all
the other structure off.

36:42.067 --> 36:43.867
For me here, the process
is going through,

36:43.902 --> 36:45.569
<i> and drilling out</i>
<i> all these old spot welds</i>

36:45.604 --> 36:47.771
that they've actually
spot-welded the structure
to the hood,

36:47.806 --> 36:51.141
and not try to drill through
and then damage
the hood skin itself.

36:56.515 --> 36:59.216
All right.
Just gonna go for it.

36:59.251 --> 37:00.283
Oh, yeah!

37:01.019 --> 37:02.352
Got movement.

37:02.387 --> 37:04.321
I was hoping
that the structure
would come off easy

37:04.356 --> 37:06.089
without any extra work,
but, you know,

37:06.124 --> 37:07.624
that's never the way it goes
with these things.

37:07.659 --> 37:09.593
This little corner
of this spot weld

37:09.628 --> 37:11.194
hanging on for dear life.

37:13.265 --> 37:14.664
Oh, yeah.

37:18.237 --> 37:20.036
Structure!

37:20.072 --> 37:21.972
That's actually
not too bad either.

37:22.007 --> 37:23.840
All the spots in here,
we can see a little bit
of corrosion.

37:23.875 --> 37:25.709
<i> Just wanna clean</i>
<i> all this stuff up.</i>

37:25.744 --> 37:28.411
<i> This thing's awesome,</i>
<i> because most people,</i>

37:28.447 --> 37:30.447
<i> like myself,</i>
<i> when you started out working</i>
<i> in your own shop,</i>

37:30.482 --> 37:32.649
<i> you don't have</i>
<i> the nice equipment like this,</i>

37:32.684 --> 37:35.051
<i> trying to get rust</i>
<i> and stuff off of metals.</i>

37:35.087 --> 37:37.687
<i> It's a completely</i>
<i> different way, either</i>
<i> hand-sanding or grinding.</i>

37:37.723 --> 37:40.924
<i> But with the sandblast,</i>
<i> it's gonna shoot high-speed</i>
<i> sand particles at it,</i>

37:40.959 --> 37:42.525
<i> and just clean up the metal.</i>

37:42.561 --> 37:44.427
<i> It's gonna come out</i>
<i> looking almost</i>
<i> perfectly clean.</i>

37:44.463 --> 37:45.695
Much better.

37:45.731 --> 37:47.430
Now that the structure
from the first hood
is cleaned up,

37:47.466 --> 37:49.366
<i> we need to remove</i>
<i> the structure</i>
<i> from the second hood,</i>

37:49.401 --> 37:50.667
<i> so we can replace it.</i>

37:50.702 --> 37:52.402
The nice part
about the other hood,

37:52.437 --> 37:54.037
all I had to do
is drill those spot welds out,

37:54.072 --> 37:55.605
and you saw
how it just slid right out.

37:55.641 --> 37:57.974
Here, on this,
the way that they got the skin

37:58.010 --> 38:00.910
of the sheet metal of the hood
rolled over like this,

38:00.946 --> 38:03.013
so, I'm actually
gonna have to roll that out,

38:03.048 --> 38:04.814
so this can slide out,

38:04.850 --> 38:07.183
and then have to fold
that all back in,

38:07.219 --> 38:11.888
and not try and jog what all
the metal lifts up here.

38:11.923 --> 38:14.190
So it's gonna be a little bit
more careful surgery.

38:15.927 --> 38:17.961
<i> Yeah, that's lifting good.</i>

38:17.996 --> 38:20.397
You can actually see two
as I pry behind it,

38:20.432 --> 38:23.233
it's moving forward,
so, it's not connected.

38:23.268 --> 38:25.302
I'll be able to finally
finesse this thing right out.

38:29.741 --> 38:30.640
Yes!

38:31.843 --> 38:32.676
Man.

38:33.845 --> 38:36.079
Got to clean this up though.

38:36.114 --> 38:37.514
So, when you're building
a new hood,

38:37.549 --> 38:39.082
such as what we're doing,

38:39.117 --> 38:41.184
trying to keep everything
exactly period correct,

38:41.219 --> 38:43.453
<i> this inner structure</i>
<i> from the hood skin,</i>

38:43.488 --> 38:44.721
which is perfect, is great,

38:44.756 --> 38:46.323
but it does not fit this car.

38:48.126 --> 38:49.125
[beep]

38:51.363 --> 38:54.164
we are replacing
the structure on the hood
for the hebmuller.

38:54.199 --> 38:57.400
It should fit
we want it to fit,
I hope it fits,

38:57.436 --> 39:00.236
but a lot of times,
things don't work out
the way you plan them.

39:00.272 --> 39:02.205
Let's test fit it,
see how she looks.

39:02.240 --> 39:04.307
[rock music
continues playing]

39:04.343 --> 39:05.208
perfect.

39:07.212 --> 39:08.912
Like it was meant to be.

39:08.947 --> 39:11.748
Since we've been able
to utilize the other structure

39:11.783 --> 39:13.216
to fix the frunk,

39:13.251 --> 39:15.552
now it's time to work
on the front leading edge.

39:15.587 --> 39:19.189
I went ahead and molded up
a new sheet metal skin,

39:19.224 --> 39:23.426
and right now,
I am making the inner flange.

39:23.462 --> 39:27.030
<i> Once I get this into shape,</i>
<i> I'll weld it</i>
<i> to that new nose piece,</i>

39:27.065 --> 39:28.264
<i> and we can get it</i>
<i> on our hood.</i>

39:28.300 --> 39:29.566
[dave]
<i> this all sounds convoluted,</i>

39:29.601 --> 39:30.867
<i> a little confusing,</i>

39:30.902 --> 39:32.469
but the car
has two hoods on it.

39:32.504 --> 39:34.904
One is on the frunk,
and one is in the back.

39:34.940 --> 39:37.040
So, the flange
seems to be fitting perfectly.

39:37.075 --> 39:38.641
<i> We're gonna go ahead</i>
<i> and remove the old nose</i>

39:38.677 --> 39:39.943
<i> and replace it</i>
<i> with a new one.</i>

39:44.282 --> 39:45.915
Well, it starts to look
like a volkswagen hood again.

40:00.866 --> 40:03.767
We got this thing fitting
absolutely fantastic,

40:03.802 --> 40:06.102
<i> so, now all I got to do,</i>
<i> is weld her in.</i>

40:09.040 --> 40:10.974
The lid, the bonnet,
the frunk...

40:11.009 --> 40:12.809
I don't know
exactly what to call it,

40:12.844 --> 40:15.545
but now we can get on
and getting the guts
in the car.

40:15.580 --> 40:17.647
[dave]
one of the biggest challenges
on this hebmuller

40:17.682 --> 40:21.017
is converting it
from a four-speed manual
to an automatic transmission.

40:21.052 --> 40:22.919
<i> So, the very first thing</i>
<i> the guys need to do,</i>

40:22.954 --> 40:25.889
is build some supports
to hold it,
so they can do a mock-up.

40:25.924 --> 40:27.590
[givens]
<i> got a structure built</i>
<i> underneath the car</i>

40:27.626 --> 40:29.092
<i> to hold everything in place.</i>

40:29.127 --> 40:31.628
I went ahead and pulled
our torsion bars out,

40:31.663 --> 40:33.763
<i> and then started</i>
<i> cutting away the material.</i>

40:33.799 --> 40:35.598
<i> I got the bulk of it out,</i>
<i> now I'm just kinda</i>

40:35.634 --> 40:37.467
<i> trimming away</i>
<i> a little bit at a time</i>

40:37.502 --> 40:40.537
until that fits in there,
'cause I don't wanna take
too much out.

40:40.572 --> 40:43.273
So, we've already
removed a ton of material
out of this pan

40:43.308 --> 40:45.041
for this new
automatic transmission.

40:45.076 --> 40:46.409
<i> I hope we don't have</i>
<i> to cut any more.</i>

40:52.284 --> 40:54.317
With all the cutting
and modification
that we've done,

40:54.352 --> 40:55.752
<i> it's still a tight fit.</i>

40:56.388 --> 40:57.821
Super close.

40:59.090 --> 41:00.590
[will] now, I bet
that's supposed
to be pretty flat.

41:02.561 --> 41:05.895
-[givens] okay.
-So, we're a long way
from there.

41:05.931 --> 41:10.433
I'm gonna clear these--
that front edge here,

41:10.469 --> 41:13.803
and see if I
can get that front down.

41:13.839 --> 41:15.972
Yeah, but I don't know
if bringing this down

41:16.007 --> 41:18.641
is gonna be as important
as bringing that side up.

41:18.677 --> 41:21.144
The challenge here is,
we have to figure out

41:21.179 --> 41:25.215
how far into the chassis
this transmission
is gonna fit.

41:25.250 --> 41:26.816
It would have to come down
at the front.

41:26.852 --> 41:30.253
Basically,
probably a half an inch.

41:30.288 --> 41:34.157
Maybe we can get it level,
but we're kind of a long ways
from there right now.

41:34.192 --> 41:37.760
Are we gonna interrupt
into the gasket surface
of the body?

41:37.796 --> 41:39.329
No, I don't think so.

41:39.364 --> 41:41.164
Is there lines that's
supposed to go out forward?

41:41.199 --> 41:44.133
Well, there is just one line
that's like upward.

41:44.169 --> 41:46.002
I don't know
if we're gonna be able
to get there

41:46.037 --> 41:47.904
if we get this up, you know.

41:47.939 --> 41:51.174
Three quarters to build
a snake ride underneath there.

41:51.209 --> 41:53.977
We can bring the back down
just enough, and get that up.

41:54.012 --> 41:55.712
I was hoping
things were gonna be easier,

41:55.747 --> 41:57.413
but it looks like
we have to make a custom piece

41:57.449 --> 41:58.648
to get
this transmission to fit.

41:58.683 --> 42:00.116
It's too bad
that any part of this

42:00.151 --> 42:02.685
wasn't a little more like
just mount on.

42:02.721 --> 42:04.888
-[laughs] you know
what I mean?
-Well, that would be easy.

42:04.923 --> 42:06.256
And then everybody
would be running around

42:06.291 --> 42:08.391
with automatics
on their volkswagens.

42:08.426 --> 42:09.626
And then how cool would we be?

42:09.661 --> 42:10.760
-We wouldn't be.
-[laughs]

42:10.795 --> 42:12.028
we would just be another guy

42:12.063 --> 42:13.229
with the same old thing

42:13.265 --> 42:14.330
we just slapped together.

42:14.366 --> 42:16.432
Now, this makes it way cooler.

42:16.468 --> 42:17.967
-Good luck, guys.
-You would just be another guy

42:18.003 --> 42:20.370
with a '50 hebmuller
with an automatic.

42:20.405 --> 42:23.106
Right, and 170 horsepower.

42:23.141 --> 42:24.774
I hope there's gonna be
something left of this chassis

42:24.809 --> 42:26.175
by the time
we get done cutting.

42:26.211 --> 42:27.076
More cutting.

42:33.251 --> 42:35.919
We need the clearance to make
this new transaxle fit,

42:35.954 --> 42:39.055
and there's only so much
of the pan and suspension
we can cut away

42:39.090 --> 42:40.823
and still have the body
fit on this thing.

42:47.432 --> 42:49.499
This is starting
to be a little more of a job
than we thought.

42:54.372 --> 42:55.672
[givens]
<i> they don't wanna overdo it.</i>

42:55.707 --> 42:58.675
<i> They don't wanna have</i>
<i> too much material gone.</i>

42:58.710 --> 43:00.276
[dave]
<i> so, we literally cannot cut</i>

43:00.312 --> 43:03.046
any more of this chassis
or pan out of the way.

43:03.081 --> 43:07.083
So, the engine obviously
is sitting down
just a little bit lower than--

43:07.118 --> 43:10.086
-...Normal.
-Yeah, we're sitting down
just a hair lower than normal.

43:10.121 --> 43:11.588
You can't go in any further,

43:11.623 --> 43:14.424
'cause then the carbs get
into the firewall too far.
