00:23.941 --> 00:27.361
I'm thinking we'll go do the show,
and then we'll go get...

00:27.444 --> 00:29.088
If you want to do a slice,
we'll get a slice.

00:29.112 --> 00:32.156
- I'll do a slice if I can get a fountain...
- Let's go in here.

00:32.241 --> 00:35.285
Do they have fountain soda?
'Cause I don't like cans.

00:35.786 --> 00:37.496
Yeah, this is it.

00:37.579 --> 00:39.039
- I love it, yeah.
- Yeah, right.

00:39.957 --> 00:43.460
But my point is, if I got an indoor
ball... a woman's ball...

00:43.919 --> 00:46.213
and I was at the top of the key,
I'd sink more threes.

00:46.296 --> 00:49.716
Yeah, but we're not allowed
at that Y anymore.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.677
No, but I'm saying if...

00:51.760 --> 00:55.973
Look, you don't have... You can go
in disguises to any place you want,

00:56.056 --> 00:58.350
if you know what you're doing
on the hard court.

00:58.850 --> 01:01.019
- I'm nervous about tonight.
- Why?

01:01.103 --> 01:03.438
'Cause we're filming it for the TV thing.

01:03.522 --> 01:05.566
I don't care. I'm gonna get high before...

01:06.692 --> 01:09.778
<i>♪ Tonight when I chase the Dragon ♪</i>

01:13.740 --> 01:15.158
- It's show time!
- It's show time!

01:17.327 --> 01:20.831
[announcer] <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>welcome to the Lyceum Theater.</i>

01:20.914 --> 01:22.624
<i>Unfortunately at this performance,</i>

01:22.708 --> 01:25.419
<i>the roles of Gil Faizon
and George St. Geegland</i>

01:25.502 --> 01:29.047
<i>will be played by Gil Faizon
and George St. Geegland.</i>

01:29.923 --> 01:31.466
Let's do Broadway.

01:32.801 --> 01:34.261
I'll see you after the show.

01:35.012 --> 01:36.513
So fucking dumb.

01:39.516 --> 01:44.813
<i>And now, please welcome,
Gil Faizon and George St. Geegland.</i>

01:46.189 --> 01:49.151
[applause]

01:59.953 --> 02:01.413
Oh, hey! I know you.

02:02.873 --> 02:06.335
[both] Oh, hello.

02:06.710 --> 02:10.339
- Charmed I'm sure, I'm Gil Faizon
- And I am George St. Geegland.

02:10.422 --> 02:12.466
And we are two legendary bachelors

02:12.549 --> 02:14.718
who live on the
Upper West Side of Manhattan.

02:14.801 --> 02:18.221
Which is the coffee breath
of neighborhoods.

02:18.555 --> 02:21.892
We want to give a shout-out
to the mezzanine and the balcony!

02:22.017 --> 02:23.685
[applause]

02:26.813 --> 02:30.984
You guys are the reason we do this show!

02:31.318 --> 02:35.197
But we will be making eye contact
solely with the orchestra.

02:35.947 --> 02:38.992
We are gonna have so much fun tonight

02:39.076 --> 02:42.871
because theater is the hot,
new thing right now.

02:42.954 --> 02:47.000
There's <i>Hamilton </i> and no other examples.

02:48.043 --> 02:49.836
Now, speaking of theater being hot,

02:49.920 --> 02:52.547
you'll notice that we are filming
the show tonight.

02:52.631 --> 02:55.509
Yes. You see cameras all over the place.

02:56.301 --> 03:01.723
We're filming this as a special
for Investigation Discovery.

03:02.682 --> 03:04.309
No, it's for Netflix.

03:04.393 --> 03:05.560
It's a binge-watch.

03:05.644 --> 03:09.189
It's a binge-watch. You watch an episode
of a show, then you wait a week,

03:09.272 --> 03:11.983
and then you binge-watch another episode.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.236
Also, if you see a camera,

03:14.319 --> 03:18.198
you know, look right down
the barrel of the lens, all right?

03:18.281 --> 03:22.786
And you know, we're trying to convey
that we have a diverse audience,

03:22.869 --> 03:26.039
so if you're white, tonight,
if you could just not be.

03:26.164 --> 03:27.207
Yeah!

03:27.290 --> 03:28.291
[audience laugh]

03:28.708 --> 03:30.502
All right, that covers the business.

03:30.585 --> 03:33.922
We want to also give a shout-out
to our dear intern Ravi in the booth.

03:34.005 --> 03:36.550
Shout-out to Ravi!

03:38.218 --> 03:39.469
OK. This is Ravi.

03:39.553 --> 03:43.056
Ravi is a junior at the
NYU Tisch School for the Arts.

03:43.140 --> 03:45.350
Yes, he's studying to be a playwright,

03:45.434 --> 03:49.271
so he's doing tech for us,
unpaid, for nine months.

03:49.479 --> 03:53.066
Yeah. He's Ravi Nandan, OK?

03:53.150 --> 03:56.111
He's one of these new Indian types.

03:56.194 --> 03:58.488
He's a real "Aziz, I'm sorry."

03:58.572 --> 03:59.823
[audience laugh]

03:59.906 --> 04:04.369
But we like to joke that Ravi
is the master of <i>fun.</i>

04:08.957 --> 04:11.334
One of our famous turns.

04:12.335 --> 04:13.712
Back to us.

04:13.795 --> 04:15.505
Some of our accolades:

04:15.589 --> 04:20.677
We are the recipients
of a 1997 restraining order.

04:21.386 --> 04:26.016
Keeping us 100 feet at all times
from America's greatest actor,

04:26.099 --> 04:27.768
Mr. Alan Alda.

04:28.435 --> 04:33.106
Alan Alda, double A, beep, beep!
"Get off my property!"

04:33.690 --> 04:35.817
But who are we really? You know?

04:35.901 --> 04:38.737
What is our essence? How to describe?

04:38.820 --> 04:42.199
You know when you get to the bottom
of a tub of hummus.

04:43.074 --> 04:45.243
And you can't fit your carrot in there,

04:45.327 --> 04:47.704
so you gotta use your fingies
to scoop it out?

04:48.997 --> 04:51.166
Bam! That's us, baby!

04:51.249 --> 04:52.918
[applause]

04:53.835 --> 04:57.339
How can I describe
the kind of vibe we give off?

04:57.422 --> 05:00.383
You know when you walk by a travel agency

05:00.467 --> 05:02.135
and you're like, "What?"

05:04.387 --> 05:05.722
- There you go.
- Yeah.

05:07.057 --> 05:10.060
We are the <i>Yerba Mate </i> tea bags,

05:10.143 --> 05:13.188
steaming the counter top
of American pop culture.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.816
But who are we as individuals?

05:15.899 --> 05:17.901
Do you mind if I get into my big story?

05:17.984 --> 05:19.653
See the stage, use it.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.780
And I accept the stage from you, sir.

05:22.155 --> 05:25.200
Of course, you all know me,
I'm George St. Geegland.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.368
- [crowd hooting]
- Hush.

05:27.786 --> 05:30.372
I'm the type of man
you would catch at a party

05:30.455 --> 05:32.249
going through the coats.

05:33.708 --> 05:35.877
I am neither Jewish, nor a woman,

05:35.961 --> 05:38.713
but like many men over the age of 70,

05:38.797 --> 05:42.384
I have reached that point in life
where I am somehow both.

05:43.718 --> 05:45.804
I was born in Providence, Rhode Island,

05:45.887 --> 05:50.267
and I am responsible for reintroducing
the Polio virus to my school district.

05:51.226 --> 05:55.146
As a novelist,
I was once compared to Philip Roth.

05:55.230 --> 05:58.024
I was also once compared
to a police sketch

05:58.108 --> 06:00.360
of this Central Park flasher.

06:01.069 --> 06:05.323
And guess what, ladies and gentlemen,
I've been married three times.

06:05.407 --> 06:07.200
Unlucky in love, we like to joke.

06:07.284 --> 06:09.828
Wonderful! Wonderful! Wonderful!

06:10.537 --> 06:16.209
All three of my wives died in the same way
on the same staircase.

06:18.545 --> 06:23.883
Each death learning from
and improving upon the death before it.

06:24.926 --> 06:27.596
And a fun fact
for this evening's performance,

06:27.679 --> 06:30.515
I am on competing medications.

06:33.685 --> 06:35.312
[applause]

06:39.524 --> 06:41.860
Well, charmed I'm sure, I'm Gil Faizon.

06:41.943 --> 06:46.323
I am a Tony Award viewing actor.

06:46.990 --> 06:49.117
And whether I live
in your building or not,

06:49.200 --> 06:52.245
I am somehow on your co-op board.

06:53.580 --> 06:57.500
I look like if Steven Spielberg
hadn't made any money.

06:57.584 --> 06:59.127
[audience laugh]

07:00.587 --> 07:03.089
Over the years,
I've had a real back and forth

07:03.173 --> 07:07.135
a <i>tête-à-têtes </i> of sorts
with fellow actor, Richard Dreyfuss.

07:07.218 --> 07:09.846
He of course got the lead in <i>Jaws,</i>

07:09.930 --> 07:13.308
and I have lockjaw
from all the cocaine I've done.

07:15.518 --> 07:18.271
I'm also an unlicensed doula.

07:21.316 --> 07:24.611
But I've made the most of my living
as a voice-over artist.

07:24.986 --> 07:28.531
I was very nearly
the official voice of CBS.

07:28.615 --> 07:31.534
Yes he was... I'm sorry,
I did not mean to interrupt you,

07:31.618 --> 07:34.496
but you did such
a beautiful audition for CBS.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.915
Would you do for them tonight
your CBS audition?

07:36.998 --> 07:39.167
I don't know if the audience
wants to hear it.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.919
[applause]

07:42.504 --> 07:45.340
I was gonna do it regardless, you know.

07:46.049 --> 07:48.677
This was my audition for CBS.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.637
[clears throat]

07:52.472 --> 07:57.143
Charmed, I'm sure, this is Gil Faizon
represented by Don Buchwald & Associates.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.605
Reading for the role of CBS.

08:01.272 --> 08:05.568
This is CBS, baby!

08:06.027 --> 08:07.445
Fun and flirty,

08:07.529 --> 08:10.949
but am I nuts, did you do
like a second alternate take?

08:11.032 --> 08:12.575
- Yeah.
- Right, you did.

08:12.659 --> 08:16.079
As an actor, you got to give options, OK?

08:16.162 --> 08:20.041
This is one of the main things
that I teach in my acting seminar,

08:20.125 --> 08:23.586
which is called,
"Improvisation for Non-Listeners."

08:24.379 --> 08:28.508
It's a five-hour seminar,
and you get a chicken lunch.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.135
It's a buffalo chicken wrap.

08:30.218 --> 08:33.513
- It's so cold...
- It's 90 percent romaine lettuce.

08:33.596 --> 08:37.017
It's a cold wrap, a warm Sierra Mist,

08:37.100 --> 08:41.104
- it's on a Saturday, it's 900 dollars.
- Yeah...

08:41.855 --> 08:44.649
It really is, it really is, OK.

08:44.983 --> 08:48.611
This is take two,
Gil Faizon, charmed, I'm sure,

08:48.695 --> 08:52.032
formerly represented
by Don Buchwald and Associates,

08:52.115 --> 08:53.616
reading for the role of CBS.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.370
CBS?

08:57.454 --> 08:58.788
[high pitched] All right!

08:59.080 --> 09:00.081
Perfect!

09:00.290 --> 09:02.500
Perfect! And let me say something,

09:02.584 --> 09:07.255
I am like, Raven-Symoné level upset
that you did not get that job.

09:07.338 --> 09:10.884
George, That is so Raven of you to say.

09:10.967 --> 09:13.303
It's not ravin', it's true.

09:13.386 --> 09:16.056
You, Gil Faizon,
how many times have I told you?

09:16.139 --> 09:18.183
You are the strongest actor in New York?

09:18.266 --> 09:19.350
Ah, this guy...

09:19.434 --> 09:20.977
This guy is my rock.

09:21.061 --> 09:25.648
He was the one who broke the news to me
that I wasn't gonna get the CBS job.

09:25.732 --> 09:28.127
- Who knows? Who knows? Who knows?
- [high pitched] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:28.151 --> 09:29.194
And you know what?

09:29.277 --> 09:32.655
He wouldn't let me sulk
for one single second, nay, nay, nay.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.075
He made me go right back on the horse.

09:35.158 --> 09:37.702
We started doing heroin that afternoon.

09:38.203 --> 09:42.832
And we'd shoot it between our toes
to keep our arms clear for racquetball.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.000
Yeah.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.627
And then what did he do?

09:45.710 --> 09:49.172
He gave me the greatest gift
that a writer can give an actor.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.883
He wrote a play for <i>me </i> to star in.

09:51.966 --> 09:53.760
Which brings us to tonight.

09:53.843 --> 09:57.180
You see, over the years, I've written
several plays for Gil and I to perform...

09:57.263 --> 09:59.849
- George, you remember the first?
- The first play we ever did?

09:59.933 --> 10:01.392
- Yes.
- Yes. I'll never forget it.

10:01.476 --> 10:04.270
The first play we ever did?
I'll never forget.

10:05.021 --> 10:09.317
I was inspired by
and directly stolen from...

10:10.318 --> 10:12.737
Sam Shepard's classic, <i>True West.</i>

10:13.154 --> 10:16.032
Yeah, but ours was called,
<i>True Upper West.</i>

10:17.200 --> 10:21.162
That was the big
M. Night Shyamalan twist at the end.

10:21.246 --> 10:24.916
Is at the end, you'd widen out,
which is hard to do in a play.

10:24.999 --> 10:27.669
But you'd widen out.

10:27.752 --> 10:31.464
And the whole time
it had been the Upper West side,

10:31.548 --> 10:33.967
and there's like, a Judaica store,

10:34.551 --> 10:37.011
that's always closed.

10:38.638 --> 10:39.681
Who's that?

10:39.889 --> 10:41.641
Who's that? Who's that guy?

10:41.724 --> 10:43.560
That's a sewer pop-up guy.

10:43.643 --> 10:46.855
You know, a guy pops out of his sewer,
"No, thanks," back down.

10:47.897 --> 10:52.652
Now, famously in the revival of <i>True West,</i>
you'd see Reilly and...

10:53.987 --> 10:57.198
- I'm sorry. And "Phil Sey" Hoffman.
- [groans]

10:57.574 --> 10:58.741
I'm sorry.

10:58.825 --> 11:04.205
It's hard, because we get choked up on cue
at the same point, every show.

11:04.956 --> 11:09.085
We just really wanted to make
Philip Seymour Hoffman's death about us.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.170
You know?

11:10.628 --> 11:15.425
Ladies and gentlemen, it behooves you
when a famous person dies,

11:15.508 --> 11:18.803
blame the year and make it about you.

11:18.887 --> 11:22.140
- [George] Yeah, yeah.
- [audience clapping]

11:25.768 --> 11:30.940
To take a Getty Image,
a watermarked Getty Image,

11:31.024 --> 11:35.361
and post a picture
on your shitty Facebook.com page.

11:35.737 --> 11:39.407
It means the world to these dead people.

11:40.575 --> 11:44.120
Now, famously,
in that revival of <i>True West,</i>

11:44.203 --> 11:47.123
John C. Reilly and "Phil Sey" Hoffman

11:47.206 --> 11:49.459
would switch parts every night.

11:52.211 --> 11:54.297
We would do <i>our </i> version of that.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.925
We would switch medications, OK?

11:57.967 --> 12:00.094
I would take George's anti-psychotics.

12:00.178 --> 12:02.805
And I would apply Gil's eczema cream.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.768
But many of you millennials
probably know us

12:06.851 --> 12:10.730
from our hit existential drama,
<i>Waiting for Godot...</i>

12:10.813 --> 12:11.898
Hello.

12:12.732 --> 12:16.861
But in our version,
Godot shows up, like three minutes in,

12:18.237 --> 12:21.157
and then we prank that mofo
with <i>Too Much Tuna, </i> baby.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.243
We come out with bowler hats on.

12:24.327 --> 12:25.648
We take them off, [clicks tongue]

12:25.703 --> 12:28.331
we got two tuna sandwiches on our heads.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.750
And the audience was in stitches.

12:30.833 --> 12:35.505
Literally, because we were performing
at a burn ward in Washington Heights.

12:36.464 --> 12:37.882
And these...

12:38.299 --> 12:40.718
- Say it.
- These fucking Dominicans...

12:42.053 --> 12:45.390
It was like...
Hey, shut the door. It was like...

12:45.974 --> 12:47.809
Like they didn't understand it.

12:47.892 --> 12:51.437
And those that understood English,
it was like, they didn't like it.

12:52.271 --> 12:55.316
Most of our plays
had been mounted in hospitals,

12:55.400 --> 12:59.904
or kill shelters
or as a skit during break at AA.

13:00.405 --> 13:04.701
Which is why it is such an honor
to be here tonight.

13:04.784 --> 13:07.453
At the Winter Garden Theater!

13:08.037 --> 13:11.124
No, no, the Lyceum Theater!

13:11.207 --> 13:12.625
[applause]

13:15.169 --> 13:17.755
I thought we booked
the Winter Garden Theater.

13:17.839 --> 13:21.384
Have you fucking tried dealing
with the Shubert Organization?

13:21.759 --> 13:24.095
I mean, this is a historic theater.

13:24.178 --> 13:27.932
Liza Minnelli mounted her iconic
<i>Liza with a "Z" </i> on this very stage,

13:28.016 --> 13:30.268
directed by the great Bob Fosse.

13:30.351 --> 13:32.145
And if you listen very closely,

13:32.228 --> 13:35.440
you can hear in the rafters
the ghost of Bob Fosse,

13:35.523 --> 13:38.276
snorting Dexedrine and drinking Visine.

13:39.861 --> 13:44.532
Here in this theater, haunted by ghosts
who could not book a different theater.

13:46.034 --> 13:49.912
Here in this theater
which is basically on Sixth Avenue.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.833
So many great playwrights
have staged their works.

13:53.916 --> 13:56.753
Tennessee Williams and his sister Serena.

13:58.129 --> 14:01.215
You know, they were rivals
but they loved each other.

14:01.299 --> 14:05.678
- I blame the father.
- [both] He pushed them too hard.

14:06.387 --> 14:08.556
- I like your take.
- I like your style.

14:09.265 --> 14:11.559
That's why this is the perfect venue

14:11.642 --> 14:13.436
for us to present to you...

14:13.519 --> 14:15.438
our new play!

14:15.897 --> 14:17.899
Ravi, curtain!

14:20.401 --> 14:22.862
[cheering]

14:27.992 --> 14:33.456
Can you imagine a Broadway show
exceeding your expectations

14:33.539 --> 14:35.833
by having a set?

14:37.085 --> 14:42.173
All of this stuff cobbled together
from discarded Broadway sets

14:42.256 --> 14:46.803
from some weird warehouse
in Secaucus, New Jersey.

14:47.261 --> 14:49.055
They have everything at this place.

14:49.138 --> 14:51.307
Old props, old costumes,

14:51.391 --> 14:55.353
the cast of <i>Newsies</i>
huddled over a flaming garbage can.

14:56.396 --> 15:01.776
This right here, this is the actual set
from the 2005 revival of <i>Steel Magnolias</i>

15:01.859 --> 15:04.153
mounted right here at the Lyceum Theater.

15:04.237 --> 15:07.407
<i>Steel Magnolias, </i> first a play,
then a movie, then again, a play.

15:07.490 --> 15:10.326
The Broadway equivalent
of moving back in with your parents.

15:11.160 --> 15:15.832
What about this wall and staircase
from a classic work of August Wilson's.

15:15.915 --> 15:19.502
August Wilson, the acclaimed
African-American playwright.

15:19.585 --> 15:22.046
I could name so many titles of his plays,

15:22.130 --> 15:24.048
but I'm gonna walk over here now.

15:25.508 --> 15:28.219
And what's this right here?
A trapdoor, yes.

15:28.302 --> 15:32.515
This is the trapdoor from the set
of <i>The Diary of Anne Frank. </i> Yeah!

15:32.598 --> 15:35.435
Not to be confused
with the diary of Anne Hathaway

15:35.518 --> 15:38.479
which we stole out of her purse
at the Gotham Awards.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.149
And what's inside? Oh, no, what's this?

15:41.232 --> 15:42.733
Oh, me, oh, my!

15:42.817 --> 15:47.780
It's the pillowman
from Martin McDonagh's <i>The Pillowman.</i>

15:47.864 --> 15:51.242
And for those you at the crappy sightline
who can't see this, raise your hand.

15:51.325 --> 15:53.744
Raise your hands if you can't see this.
All right. OK.

15:53.870 --> 15:56.497
So what you're missing is...

15:56.914 --> 16:02.170
It's a pillow with googly eyes
and paper towel arms, all right?

16:02.837 --> 16:06.674
So next time, get your tickets earlier
or just make more money.

16:12.096 --> 16:16.684
And in honor of Jean-Paul Sartre's
classic play, <i>No Exit,</i>

16:16.767 --> 16:20.688
we have installed a "No Exit" sign.

16:21.606 --> 16:27.403
Which the city of New York informs
us is a massive fire hazard.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.864
And what's this right here, the gramophone

16:29.947 --> 16:32.575
and shelving unit
from a Tony Award winning play,

16:32.658 --> 16:36.412
again mounted right here
at the Lyceum Theater, <i>I Am My Own Wife.</i>

16:36.496 --> 16:39.624
You know, I once had Gil
pretend to be my own wife,

16:39.707 --> 16:43.294
in order to throw off
the homicide detective's timeline.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.048
I wore a dress.

16:48.341 --> 16:52.345
Why he wore a dress to make a phone call,
we will never know.

16:53.304 --> 16:56.974
And what's this right here?
This is the heart and soul of this set.

16:57.058 --> 17:00.311
This is the original stoop
from <i>The Cosby Show.</i>

17:00.895 --> 17:03.231
Which we got for like, nothing.

17:04.272 --> 17:06.400
They paid us to take it.

17:06.483 --> 17:10.530
They were like, "This thing's got
bad juju, get it off our hands", you know.

17:10.613 --> 17:14.575
But of course, the final piece
of inanimate set decoration,

17:14.659 --> 17:16.493
is you, the audience.

17:16.577 --> 17:20.455
A collection of comedy nerds
and theater dorks and...

17:20.540 --> 17:25.962
[laughs] children whose parents
have made a severe miscalculation.

17:28.506 --> 17:30.967
All of you gathered together,

17:31.050 --> 17:34.178
wondering if there will be
an intermission.

17:34.512 --> 17:36.806
There will not!

17:37.640 --> 17:40.309
While you're here in the theater,
some ground rules to follow.

17:40.393 --> 17:43.312
Ground rules, first off,
cellphones, turn them on!

17:43.396 --> 17:44.772
Take calls.

17:46.649 --> 17:48.276
Take calls, text people.

17:48.359 --> 17:51.946
But if you're gonna text someone,
do it like your dad in temple, you know?

17:58.286 --> 18:01.872
Also, we have free Wi-Fi
for everyone here tonight.

18:02.498 --> 18:06.460
The network is "Kimpton Hotels,"
and the password is "guest."

18:08.045 --> 18:10.381
If you have winter hats and coats,

18:10.464 --> 18:13.718
put your <i>shit </i> wherever you want.

18:14.051 --> 18:19.390
Treat this theater the way
an Ultra-Orthodox Jew treats an airplane.

18:19.473 --> 18:21.350
Spread out!

18:22.351 --> 18:25.479
That chair is for your hat, baby.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.859
Perhaps you didn't have time
before the show

18:29.942 --> 18:33.279
to eat at Guy Fieri's
Great American Garbage Fire.

18:35.114 --> 18:38.784
- Eat food in the theater.
- Eat a meal during the play.

18:38.868 --> 18:41.203
Even if you're like a Jamaican nurse,

18:41.287 --> 18:44.749
and you brought your dinner
in a big weird Tupperware.

18:45.082 --> 18:47.168
And when you crack the lid,

18:47.251 --> 18:48.836
wow!

18:50.046 --> 18:53.633
It changes the pH of the room.

18:56.135 --> 18:59.805
Maybe you brought yourself a sweet treat
'cause you got low blood sugar.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.933
Make sure to open
your little plastic candies...

19:03.017 --> 19:05.603
- [crinkles paper]
<i>- Very </i> slowly.

19:06.020 --> 19:10.024
Thinking they'll make less noise,
whereas this will make so much more noise.

19:10.566 --> 19:15.154
Really, indulge the crinkle
as you undress your Swedish Fish,

19:15.529 --> 19:18.574
the Lamborghini of the gummies.

19:20.034 --> 19:23.204
Or perhaps you brought yourself
a Werther's Original,

19:23.287 --> 19:25.873
the AMBER Alert of caramels.

19:25.956 --> 19:27.458
[audience laugh]

19:29.126 --> 19:33.297
Now, those of you familiar with
our <i>oeuvre, </i> which means eggs,

19:33.381 --> 19:36.133
will recognize this play.

19:36.217 --> 19:39.470
It's a little more autobiographical
than our other plays.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.514
- That's right. <i>Oh, Hello.</i>
<i>- Oh, Hello.</i>

19:42.682 --> 19:45.810
We draw on 70 years of a life lived.

19:46.227 --> 19:48.771
A first job, a second marriage.

19:48.854 --> 19:51.357
When you open your cab door
into a city biker

19:51.440 --> 19:54.485
as a silent protest
against Mayor De Blasio.

19:55.319 --> 19:58.572
It's a play about
those emotional moments in life,

19:58.656 --> 20:01.867
like when you get a multi-vitamin
caught in your throat

20:02.243 --> 20:06.288
and it burns so bad that you bail
on your daughter's wedding.

20:07.707 --> 20:10.251
I play a character
named George Reddington.

20:10.334 --> 20:12.420
Yes, he's a bit based on me.

20:12.503 --> 20:14.714
He's a very successful novelist,

20:14.797 --> 20:17.883
who's having a lot of trouble
with this Swedish Fish right now.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.220
And I play Gil Stone,

20:21.303 --> 20:24.932
a working actor
who just got yelled at backstage

20:25.015 --> 20:27.727
for moving a chair in a Union House.

20:29.186 --> 20:30.312
I'm sorry.

20:31.397 --> 20:32.857
Oh, yeah? Well you know what?

20:32.940 --> 20:35.651
In England, that's a slang term
for cigarettes, so...

20:38.738 --> 20:41.866
We love the great traditions
of the theater

20:41.949 --> 20:45.786
and that is why we plan
to pay humpage to them tonight.

20:46.203 --> 20:48.622
For example, the one-sided telephone call.

20:48.706 --> 20:51.625
Oh, this is very good.
The one-sided telephone call.

20:51.709 --> 20:54.962
This is when a character in a play,
does a telephone call,

20:55.045 --> 20:58.674
but they repeat all
the phone call information out loud

20:58.758 --> 21:00.509
to the other characters on the stage.

21:00.968 --> 21:04.472
First, get a telephone
no one would have in real life.

21:04.555 --> 21:05.890
Oh, hello.

21:06.766 --> 21:12.021
Then as an actor, do way too much business
with the phone, all right?

21:12.104 --> 21:16.150
Really make a fucking meal out of it.

21:17.860 --> 21:22.156
And now, we humbly present
the one-sided telephone call.

21:22.239 --> 21:24.575
Ravi, a melodramatic wash.

21:28.078 --> 21:29.330
Oh, hello?

21:30.039 --> 21:31.540
Oh, charmed, I'm sure.

21:32.249 --> 21:33.834
The police?

21:33.918 --> 21:35.419
That's who <i>you </i> are?

21:38.214 --> 21:39.924
A car accident?

21:43.260 --> 21:45.387
George's daughter?

21:46.806 --> 21:49.266
Her head ended up where?

21:50.142 --> 21:52.663
- Are they talking...
- I'm on the phone, I'm on the phone, man.

21:54.605 --> 21:55.689
OK, yeah,

21:56.023 --> 21:57.274
I'll tell him.

21:58.609 --> 22:00.027
Oh, charmed, I'm sure.

22:02.738 --> 22:05.991
Hey, George, my friend of all friends.

22:06.534 --> 22:07.660
Look at me!

22:07.743 --> 22:10.412
I have awful, simply horrible news,

22:10.496 --> 22:13.874
but that was a one-sided telephone call!

22:13.958 --> 22:15.376
[airhorn sounds]

22:17.086 --> 22:21.090
[applause]

22:21.215 --> 22:23.467
You are so stupid.

22:24.844 --> 22:28.264
My daughter is not dead,
I talked to her a year ago.

22:29.682 --> 22:33.769
Another device I love in theater
is coughing into a handkerchief

22:33.852 --> 22:35.896
to show the audience that you are dying.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.983
- Would you assist me with this?
- All right.

22:39.066 --> 22:41.193
[groans]

22:43.362 --> 22:46.824
Hey, little kids, get your ice cream.
Get your...

22:47.908 --> 22:50.578
Are you sick, Mr. Manzini?

22:51.745 --> 22:53.122
No, Giuseppe.

22:53.998 --> 22:55.416
I'ma gonna be OK.

22:55.874 --> 22:57.251
Boom time!

22:58.586 --> 23:00.296
He's not well.

23:01.964 --> 23:03.674
That guy is sick as a dick.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.720
- Audiences like to be screamed at.
- Correct.

23:08.387 --> 23:13.601
The backbone of contemporary
American theater is screaming stuff.

23:14.226 --> 23:18.230
For starters, it wakes the audience up
towards the end of the third act.

23:18.564 --> 23:22.151
But also it reveals things from the past.

23:22.443 --> 23:26.989
My father was my brother
and that's why we can't go to lunch today.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.909
Do you want to know why?

23:30.993 --> 23:34.622
Do you want to know why, Karen?

23:34.705 --> 23:38.500
Because I could not afford
Adobe Photoshop!

23:41.170 --> 23:42.630
My baby.

23:43.505 --> 23:45.341
My chair baby.

23:45.883 --> 23:47.468
He killed you.

23:48.344 --> 23:50.929
Why?

23:56.310 --> 23:58.395
[applause]

23:59.938 --> 24:03.942
That is of course, from lonesco's <i>Chairs.</i>

24:04.818 --> 24:06.278
Let's talk endings.

24:06.362 --> 24:10.616
I like when a character
says something mildly significant,

24:10.699 --> 24:12.201
and then the lights dim,

24:12.284 --> 24:14.411
and you're sitting in your seat,
you're like...

24:15.621 --> 24:17.164
Huh?

24:17.748 --> 24:19.166
Is that... is that...

24:19.917 --> 24:21.752
"Is that the fucking end of the play?"

24:24.922 --> 24:27.341
May I demonstrate
one of these awful dim lights?

24:27.424 --> 24:29.176
- Porcupine please.
- Thank you.

24:29.885 --> 24:32.304
Is there a center mark for me to stand?

24:32.388 --> 24:34.223
OK, that'll do.

24:34.306 --> 24:38.060
Ravi, can you write a "G" on that
so I know it's for George and not Gil?

24:38.143 --> 24:39.395
Thank you.

24:40.646 --> 24:42.564
Ravi, hit me with the spotlight.

24:44.483 --> 24:47.403
By the way, Ravi, way too loud
with the intro music. Way too loud.

24:47.486 --> 24:50.197
You bring the house to half,
then you do the announce.

24:50.280 --> 24:52.658
Don't ever pooch the opening
in my show again.

24:52.950 --> 24:55.661
All right, we're having a nice time, so...

24:56.412 --> 25:00.582
So this is a line of dialogue
and then it dimmed.

25:01.792 --> 25:05.963
You know, looking back,
my father was a poor man,

25:06.046 --> 25:10.092
but in the end,
he gave us the greatest gift of all,

25:10.592 --> 25:14.763
a 1997 Toyota Tercel.

25:16.682 --> 25:20.102
[laughter and applause]

25:22.271 --> 25:23.397
Thank you.

25:23.480 --> 25:25.691
- What are you eating?
- Cashews.

25:25.774 --> 25:27.401
Oh!

25:27.484 --> 25:30.112
- That's expensive.
- But imaginary.

25:30.195 --> 25:31.822
- There you go.
- All right, yeah.

25:32.698 --> 25:33.991
I'm allergic.

25:36.827 --> 25:38.662
- Uh, I take grievance.
- With my performance?

25:38.746 --> 25:41.582
No, the performance
was Pontiac perfection. Yeah

25:42.541 --> 25:44.960
- I take grievance with the dialogue.
- Too poignant?

25:45.043 --> 25:46.170
- Too significant.
- Yes.

25:46.253 --> 25:48.464
I like when a play ends just a sentence.

25:48.547 --> 25:51.884
That naturalistic thing,
where the playwright is trying to say,

25:51.967 --> 25:54.052
there's no good dialogue in real life,

25:54.136 --> 25:56.472
- so why should I work that hard?
- Yeah.

25:57.431 --> 26:00.517
- Mother, may I?
- Speak in plain, child.

26:01.643 --> 26:03.103
[mumbles to self]

26:07.691 --> 26:08.942
Oh, waiter,

26:09.318 --> 26:12.488
I'll have one more root beer, please.

26:13.822 --> 26:15.032
Man...

26:15.115 --> 26:17.284
[laughter and applause]

26:25.834 --> 26:27.753
I got the chills.

26:28.253 --> 26:29.713
I got the chills.

26:29.797 --> 26:31.173
[yelping in delight]

26:31.256 --> 26:33.467
- I got the chills.
- You got the chills, man?

26:33.550 --> 26:35.677
- Are you...
- [yelps] I got them.

26:37.054 --> 26:38.806
You got the chills, are you sick?

26:38.889 --> 26:42.226
No, I got the chills
from your magnificent performance.

26:42.309 --> 26:45.187
- Though I do have pneumococcal pneumonia.
- All right.

26:45.896 --> 26:47.773
You know, I have mesothelioma.

26:47.856 --> 26:48.857
How did you get it?

26:48.941 --> 26:50.150
From a commercial.

26:52.236 --> 26:55.197
Well, we are about to get started.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.698
But before we do...

26:59.618 --> 27:01.161
- You gonna hold that?
- Yeah.

27:01.245 --> 27:02.579
- All right.
- It's got a flick...

27:02.663 --> 27:04.122
- I'm just gonna flick the tip.
- OK.

27:04.790 --> 27:08.168
That made it a billion times
worse right there.

27:09.127 --> 27:11.004
We are about to get started.

27:11.505 --> 27:13.590
- No, fucking... No.
- What?

27:14.258 --> 27:16.718
Not in life or in the play ever,

27:17.094 --> 27:20.264
ever put your nail in between my nail.

27:20.681 --> 27:22.391
In my fingie meat.

27:22.891 --> 27:25.602
For real, don't ever do that ever again,
for real.

27:25.978 --> 27:28.772
- This... That's a protected settlement.
- Yeah.

27:30.983 --> 27:32.192
[indistinct]

27:33.277 --> 27:35.404
Then I'm Netanyahu, baby!

27:37.614 --> 27:40.117
- 'Cause you're my little Bibi.
- Yeah, that's right.

27:40.784 --> 27:43.078
Why are you holding on to my finger?

27:43.161 --> 27:45.581
'Cause I'm nervous.
I want the show to go well.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.708
Because we're on Broadway.

27:47.791 --> 27:50.460
But, Gil, remember what we always say?

27:50.544 --> 27:53.213
Treat a four like a six,
and she'll be grateful.

27:58.093 --> 28:00.345
No. Let's do our best.

28:00.429 --> 28:02.931
- Oh!
- Jesus Christ!

28:03.765 --> 28:06.310
Enjoy the play!

28:06.393 --> 28:08.520
[cheering]

28:13.275 --> 28:15.444
- This crowd sucks.
- Yeah, it's great.

28:19.573 --> 28:21.783
[dramatic music]

28:21.950 --> 28:25.579
George steps forward
to read stage direction.

28:26.914 --> 28:32.377
He leans to one side because
the "stage direction" is italicized.

28:36.173 --> 28:40.010
Our play begins
on the Upper West Side of Manhattan,

28:40.093 --> 28:43.472
73rd & Columbus, to be exact.

28:43.555 --> 28:48.227
The setting: A large Upper West Side
rent-controlled building.

28:48.310 --> 28:50.938
The kind of place
where all the recycling bins

28:51.021 --> 28:53.523
are filled with used oxygen tanks.

28:54.191 --> 28:55.651
And what's this up here?

28:56.652 --> 28:57.694
What?

28:57.778 --> 29:01.907
Why, it's the front door
of our two heroes' apartment.

29:01.990 --> 29:05.285
A mezuzah is nailed to the door frame.

29:05.369 --> 29:09.998
Just below the painted over nails
of a former mezuzah.

29:11.500 --> 29:14.586
And for those of you
observant enough to clock,

29:14.670 --> 29:18.799
that this mezuzah is on the wrong side
of the door frame,

29:18.882 --> 29:20.342
you're at the right play.

29:20.467 --> 29:22.761
[audience laugh]

29:22.970 --> 29:27.849
We open on a brown room,
with pea-colored sunlight

29:27.933 --> 29:32.562
illuminating what must be pounds
of flaked off, old man dry skin.

29:33.313 --> 29:35.190
We meet George Reddington.

29:35.274 --> 29:39.486
George can hardly get hard,
so he must use a tongue depressor

29:39.569 --> 29:41.613
as a splint on his schvantz.

29:46.660 --> 29:48.287
I don't know.

29:49.871 --> 29:53.208
George is hung like a hotel painting,

29:53.834 --> 29:57.629
in that it's crooked
and has seen awful things.

29:57.713 --> 29:58.797
[audience laugh]

30:03.760 --> 30:05.721
He speaks on the phone. Shh!

30:07.472 --> 30:11.685
Well, I'm doing pretty well,
considering I'm a 72-year-old novelist,

30:11.768 --> 30:15.230
and I live with my best friend Gil
and he's an actor. OK, bye.

30:20.193 --> 30:24.698
Just then, Gil Stone, aged 40, enters.

30:25.991 --> 30:28.785
- Are you sure you can play 40?
- [high pitched] Yes!

30:29.369 --> 30:32.039
Gil Stone, aged 40, enters.

30:32.122 --> 30:34.166
He is soaked from the rain.

30:38.712 --> 30:41.423
No matter what
health food store you go to,

30:41.506 --> 30:44.092
Gil is blocking the vitamin aisle.

30:45.469 --> 30:49.598
Gil's hair,
it's like the JonBenét Ramsey case.

30:49.681 --> 30:54.019
The more you look into it,
the more questions you have.

30:55.562 --> 30:58.857
Gil speaks and says his lines as written.

30:59.107 --> 31:02.736
George, have you ever noticed
that New York in the rain

31:02.819 --> 31:04.404
is like jazz music?

31:05.781 --> 31:08.909
No, I haven't, my friend,
but keep going with this.

31:08.992 --> 31:13.372
Well, they're in drops.
There like a brush on a tight snare drum.

31:13.580 --> 31:14.664
[snares play]

31:14.956 --> 31:17.084
And the honking of the horns. Oh!

31:17.167 --> 31:19.669
That's like Miles, baby.

31:19.795 --> 31:22.839
[jazz music plays]

31:23.840 --> 31:27.052
And for the subway?
You got yourself a xylophone.

31:27.135 --> 31:28.678
Bing bong.

31:28.762 --> 31:31.515
"Stay clear of the falling rain, please."

31:31.890 --> 31:33.892
I don't want to do the water anymore.

31:34.017 --> 31:35.852
Whoa! Whoa!

31:35.936 --> 31:39.022
The water spray is the fucking
strongest part of the show.

31:40.399 --> 31:42.567
Makes my glasses all watery.

31:42.651 --> 31:44.736
Look, I know that, OK?

31:44.820 --> 31:47.656
You know, Mark and Judy came
with their adult son last week,

31:47.739 --> 31:49.574
they told me they love the water spray.

31:49.658 --> 31:52.077
But Mark and Judy like Stomp.

31:54.454 --> 31:57.666
- You know, I like Stomp.
- I love Stomp.

31:57.749 --> 31:59.793
They bang everything.

31:59.876 --> 32:03.046
It's the new... You have got
to go see Stomp on tour.

32:03.130 --> 32:05.006
- It's the same.
- Ah!

32:06.716 --> 32:09.845
So tell me, Gil, how was your meeting
today with your agent?

32:09.928 --> 32:11.972
- It was horrible.
- Oh, no.

32:12.055 --> 32:15.016
I mean, he doesn't get me at all.
You know?

32:15.100 --> 32:17.769
I'm a serious theater actor.

32:17.853 --> 32:20.313
He's got me going out for commercials.

32:20.397 --> 32:22.107
Can you imagine me,

32:22.190 --> 32:25.527
Gil Stone, hocking Scotch Tape?

32:27.446 --> 32:31.158
There you go again
with that artistic integrity.

32:31.241 --> 32:33.326
See me? I'm all about money.

32:33.410 --> 32:36.580
What are we, two characters
with different perspectives?

32:36.997 --> 32:41.835
[splattered laughter]

32:42.043 --> 32:44.463
- I can't do it anymore, George.
- Gil.

32:44.546 --> 32:47.549
- I got to get out of this rat race.
- Be pragmatic.

32:48.216 --> 32:51.136
I walked out of an audition today.

32:51.219 --> 32:53.263
For Clamato, I mean...

32:53.346 --> 32:56.266
We're talking about Clamato, George.

32:56.349 --> 33:02.063
The number one clam/tomato
juice operation in the country today.

33:02.481 --> 33:04.566
Some would say the only.

33:05.150 --> 33:08.111
How could you walk out of that?
What is going on with you?

33:08.195 --> 33:11.406
I made a promise, George. A promise.

33:11.907 --> 33:13.492
To my parents.

33:16.536 --> 33:17.746
I miss them, you know.

33:18.705 --> 33:22.792
You know, my father, before he died,
he told me two things.

33:23.210 --> 33:26.796
First, that he ratted out other Jews
during the Holocaust.

33:29.633 --> 33:32.677
And second, and more importantly...

33:34.804 --> 33:36.515
He said, you got to be yourself.

33:37.349 --> 33:40.769
And that's what I'm trying to do every day
in this crazy rat race, man.

33:41.186 --> 33:42.771
Is, I got to be me.

33:42.854 --> 33:44.481
I got to be Gil!

33:44.856 --> 33:46.942
This line hangs there in the air

33:47.025 --> 33:49.986
like Lenny Kravitz's very nice,
very full penis,

33:50.070 --> 33:52.322
remember when his pants split
and it fell out.

33:52.405 --> 33:56.368
There's a video of it.
This was like, 15 months ago.

33:56.451 --> 33:58.036
We here it at <i>Oh, Hello </i> feel

33:58.119 --> 34:00.956
this did not get enough attention
at the time.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.332
[audience laugh]

34:03.291 --> 34:04.793
Gil continues speaking.

34:04.876 --> 34:08.713
But then suddenly and quite inorganically,
he starts singing.

34:09.422 --> 34:11.550
So I walk out of the audition,

34:11.632 --> 34:14.844
and I head over to Fairway Supermarket
to molest olives.

34:16.763 --> 34:18.764
And that's when it hits me.

34:19.474 --> 34:24.771
<i>♪ Sweet Rosalie
She's working at the five and dime ♪</i>

34:24.853 --> 34:27.732
I have had that song
stuck in my head all day, Gil.

34:28.733 --> 34:33.822
<i>♪ Train back to Hackensack
With rosemary wine ♪</i>

34:34.697 --> 34:38.326
<i>♪ Yo deedle doidle dee ♪</i>

34:38.409 --> 34:39.452
[mimics bass]

34:39.536 --> 34:41.996
<i>♪ Cocaine, snort ♪</i>

34:42.080 --> 34:45.708
<i>♪ We both like to do cocaine ♪</i>

34:46.418 --> 34:49.713
- God, what is that song?
- It's got to be Steely Dan, right?

34:49.795 --> 34:53.592
Oh, it's a billion percent Steely Dan.

34:53.675 --> 34:57.470
Remember seeing Steely Dan at
the Beacon Theater, nine nights in a row?

34:57.554 --> 34:59.389
I love the Beacon Theater.

34:59.472 --> 35:02.350
Oh, the Beacon Theater,
it's like the Apollo Theater

35:02.434 --> 35:05.520
for people who are scared to go
into the Apollo.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.940
Walter Becker from Steely Dan,

35:09.024 --> 35:13.486
playing his guitar like he's in the band
at the end of a Lunesta commercial.

35:15.697 --> 35:17.449
Donald Fagen on the keys

35:17.532 --> 35:21.328
looking like if Ray Charles
played the organ at a reformed synagogue.

35:21.536 --> 35:25.624
[beatboxing the bass guitar]

35:27.542 --> 35:29.669
George, did you know the name Steely Dan

35:29.753 --> 35:32.922
originated as a dildo
in a William Burroughs novel?

35:33.006 --> 35:34.424
Of course, I know that.

35:34.507 --> 35:37.010
You and I know a lot about Steely Dan.

35:40.597 --> 35:41.598
- Gil?
- Here.

35:41.723 --> 35:43.892
- Would you check the mail for me?
- All right.

35:43.975 --> 35:46.519
I'm waiting on a reply from my publisher

35:46.603 --> 35:50.357
about my new novel, <i>Next Stop: Ronkonkoma.</i>

35:50.732 --> 35:53.777
It's the story of a Long Island
railroad trip

35:53.860 --> 35:57.155
told from a hundred
different perspectives.

36:03.036 --> 36:04.537
Let's see here. [clears throat]

36:04.621 --> 36:06.206
"Attention, tenants.

36:06.289 --> 36:10.043
Water will be shut off
from 9 a.m. until 4 p.m.

36:10.126 --> 36:11.795
to punish the unemployed."

36:14.089 --> 36:15.674
Seems mean-spirited, right?

36:15.757 --> 36:17.467
I make my own water.

36:20.220 --> 36:21.680
Oh, yeah, OK. This one.

36:21.763 --> 36:24.391
"Dear Mr. Reddington and Mr. Stone,

36:24.474 --> 36:28.645
Your rent controlled apartment
is no longer rent-controlled."

36:30.730 --> 36:33.942
But we've been living
in this apartment for 40 years,

36:34.025 --> 36:36.486
paying $75 a month.

36:36.903 --> 36:39.698
It's our God-given right
to pay the same amount of rent

36:39.781 --> 36:42.409
regardless of property value or inflation.

36:42.742 --> 36:44.536
This is an outrage.

36:44.953 --> 36:46.996
Ravi, I need that chair to shatter.

36:47.080 --> 36:48.748
Let me see this.

36:48.832 --> 36:52.585
"Your rent is being increased
to $2,500 a month."

36:52.961 --> 36:56.131
Twenty-five hundred dollars
for a measly five-bedroom

36:56.214 --> 36:58.675
with office, crown molding, and fireplace?

36:59.175 --> 37:01.219
How much money do I even have on me?

37:01.302 --> 37:04.431
What is this?
"Remember, you have Alzheimer's."

37:04.514 --> 37:06.599
What does that even mean?

37:08.059 --> 37:12.272
I'm so sick of finding
all these stupid notes in all my shit.

37:14.399 --> 37:16.776
When I find the guy
that's putting them there...

37:16.860 --> 37:18.987
What are you gonna do to him, Georgie?

37:19.070 --> 37:20.947
You know, c'mere jabroni.

37:21.030 --> 37:22.449
Stay out of my mirror.

37:22.574 --> 37:25.326
[Gil] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:25.827 --> 37:28.037
Tell me, Gil, is there a third...

37:30.081 --> 37:33.334
Tell me, Gil,
is there a third letter from my...

37:34.043 --> 37:35.962
- It works best if I do the set up.
- OK.

37:39.507 --> 37:41.801
Gil, is there a... Fucking wait!

37:41.885 --> 37:44.429
[loud laughter]

37:55.815 --> 37:59.694
Say, Gil, is there a third letter
from my publisher?

37:59.778 --> 38:02.030
Maybe if they sent a big enough advance,

38:02.113 --> 38:04.532
we don't have to worry about the new rent.

38:08.453 --> 38:11.164
- Give me the fucking letter.
- Just ask for the letter.

38:12.040 --> 38:14.501
- Are we on the same team?
- Yeah.

38:14.584 --> 38:16.252
The '86 Mets.

38:19.005 --> 38:21.508
- You're all right, you know that?
- Yeah, thanks, man.

38:22.175 --> 38:25.220
- It's from them and it's nice and thin.
- Less is more, Georgie.

38:25.303 --> 38:28.097
Good news comes in thin envelopes.

38:28.932 --> 38:30.558
"Dear Mr. Reddington.

38:30.642 --> 38:34.938
We received your amazing manuscript,

A one thousand page,
totally unproofed document.

38:39.859 --> 38:44.239
Unfortunately, we are only interested
in young adult puff pieces now.

38:44.322 --> 38:46.533
Like <i>Twilight </i> or <i>The Corrections.</i>

38:47.116 --> 38:50.161
Maybe you should give more thought
to a younger audience."

38:50.829 --> 38:52.372
The nerve of these people.

38:52.455 --> 38:54.499
I think about teens all the time.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.920
But, George, what did the letter say?

39:05.218 --> 39:08.012
It said I'm not gonna get the book deal.

39:08.096 --> 39:09.973
Oh, my God,
I'm not gonna get the book deal.

39:10.640 --> 39:14.352
And I already bought that sheep dog
for the author photo.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.814
Boy, that guy is going back to Chinatown.

- Good, that's good to hear.
- Thank you for that measured compliment.

52:21.263 --> 52:25.184
Let's put it this way,
I have great hopes from here on out.

52:25.267 --> 52:26.727
Oh, that's so nice.

52:26.810 --> 52:29.772
You yourself are a playwright
of some great esteem.

52:29.855 --> 52:31.231
Well, thank you very much.

52:31.315 --> 52:33.859
- But I think you've nailed it.
- Thank you.

52:33.942 --> 52:37.237
- You nailed the essence of playwriting.
- Thank you.

52:37.321 --> 52:39.448
By the way, you know
what Mike Nichols told me once.

52:39.531 --> 52:42.201
- He said, there was the...
- Oh, you drop something.

52:44.953 --> 52:48.332
Jesus Christ.
Two minutes in to the interview.

52:50.084 --> 52:52.336
- Not that Mike Nichols.
- Oh, all right.

52:53.045 --> 52:58.300
He told me that RKO Pictures
had a philosophy that if...

52:58.384 --> 53:02.179
In their movies, when the phone rang,
if the news was sad,

53:02.262 --> 53:03.764
you answer the phone happy.

53:03.847 --> 53:06.558
And if the news was happy,
you answer the phone sad.

53:06.642 --> 53:08.102
I don't understand.

53:09.311 --> 53:11.939
- Can I see an example of this?
- Yes. Where's the phone?

53:12.022 --> 53:14.650
Let's get Steve a phone, OK.

53:15.025 --> 53:16.610
Here we go.

53:17.194 --> 53:19.655
Do you want to do a cross?
Or do you want to be seated?

53:19.738 --> 53:20.739
How do you wanna do this?

53:20.823 --> 53:22.908
I think I have to cross.
We have to be talking.

53:22.991 --> 53:24.493
Is the news happy or sad?

53:24.868 --> 53:26.662
- It's gonna be sad.
- It's gonna be sad.

53:26.745 --> 53:28.455
Oh, that's so...

53:28.539 --> 53:31.500
I know, it was so great.
That was so funny...

53:31.583 --> 53:32.793
Sorry.

53:35.796 --> 53:36.964
OK!

53:38.966 --> 53:41.135
Action one. Action one.

- Yes, OK.

than he is, but I'll do my best.

53:49.059 --> 53:50.602
I will do my best, OK.

54:09.121 --> 54:10.539
- Who was that?
- Mike Nichols.

54:10.622 --> 54:12.207
Oh, my God!

54:12.291 --> 54:14.877

on 83rd Street.

54:15.794 --> 54:18.505
- Let's keep it.
- You want to keep it?

- First of all, I'm taking it.
- You're taking it? You're welcome to it.

that are special to you?

54:30.058 --> 54:32.352
- Yes.
- Would you name them now?

54:32.436 --> 54:33.479
Oh!

54:34.855 --> 54:36.982
I have my <i>Three Amigos </i> outfit.

54:40.027 --> 54:42.696
- Do you ever put it on?
- Do I ever put it on?

54:42.779 --> 54:45.657
- You ever wear it?
- I don't want to go there now.

Yeah, it's called <i>No Amigos.</i>

[Steve] Yeah.

55:03.800 --> 55:05.844
Did you ever know Trump
in your dealings...

55:05.928 --> 55:08.764
- I never met him, no.
- Never?

55:08.847 --> 55:11.475
He wasn't at <i>New Yorker </i> cocktail parties?

55:12.809 --> 55:14.269
- No.
- No?

55:14.978 --> 55:17.731
- That would be very unlikely, wouldn't it?
- Yes, it would.

55:17.814 --> 55:20.859
And you never went
to Maxim Hottest 100 parties.

55:22.611 --> 55:25.155
- But you are an art collector.
- Yes, that's...

55:25.239 --> 55:29.159
Well, I have collected a few paintings
uh, through my life.

55:29.701 --> 55:34.206
I'm happy to say that I've actually earned
more money doing that than show business.

55:34.289 --> 55:36.375
- Really?
- No, I'm kidding.

55:37.751 --> 55:38.794
Hello, who's that guy?

55:40.504 --> 55:42.589
Did Jews not control the world of art?

55:43.966 --> 55:46.593
- Do people think you're Jewish or no?
- No, they don't.

Oh, congratulations.

55:50.138 --> 55:53.225
I can honestly say that not one person.

on the street? "You Jewish?"

55:55.978 --> 55:57.896
- "You Jewish?"
- No.

56:00.023 --> 56:02.609
Presbyterians don't do that?
"You Presbyterian?

with Jews on the street.

56:13.787 --> 56:15.664
Are you a religious man?

56:15.747 --> 56:17.416
- No, not at all.
- No?

56:17.499 --> 56:22.629
- Did you ever believe in God?
- Probably when I was a young kid.

56:22.713 --> 56:24.339
But no more.

56:24.423 --> 56:26.550
Was magic...
Was it because you believe in magic?

56:30.387 --> 56:34.850
Yes, learning... When I realized
card tricks were actually a trick,

- I said, there must be no God.
- Yes.

and you're like, "I know how to do that."

- Yeah, you palm a fish and...

Oh, look what I have here.

Do you remember?

56:59.875 --> 57:01.460
That's really private.

57:03.879 --> 57:07.007
No, I don't. I can't remember that.

57:07.299 --> 57:09.134
It was probably a store-bought trick.

57:10.093 --> 57:11.803
Not just simple slight of hand?

57:11.887 --> 57:13.555
Well, I learned that later. Yeah.

57:13.639 --> 57:16.284
- Do you still know slight of hand?
- I still know a little bit of it.

57:16.308 --> 57:18.310
- Could you do it with a French fry?
- Sure.

do you love the most?

When you're doing an amphitheater,
Steve Martin, 1979.

58:22.582 --> 58:25.544
You're doing an amphitheater.
You're doing a Hollywood Bowl.

58:25.627 --> 58:27.587
What are you making for that night?

58:29.840 --> 58:34.219
Well, in those days, I was criticized
for charging a high price.

58:34.302 --> 58:35.679
- What was that?
- Ten dollars.

58:36.763 --> 58:38.432
- You know how much these...
- I know.

58:41.852 --> 58:44.730
I've been trying to get
into your show for so long,

58:44.813 --> 58:46.940
and I could not get a free ticket.

And then tonight, you said,
if I could come on stage with you.

58:51.069 --> 58:53.280
You had to sell a Picasso
to get in here.

58:55.032 --> 58:56.825
You did that... You wrote...

- No, let him struggle.

Wow, you made a great transition.

He's covering for me
because I couldn't remember <i>Lapin Agile,</i>

59:20.557 --> 59:23.351
- Yeah. What were you gonna say?
- Picasso at the Bistro.

59:24.936 --> 59:27.689
I was gonna say
Picasso at <i>Au Bon Pain.</i>

59:28.982 --> 59:32.110
Which is a French expression
for breakfast at LaGuardia.

59:38.575 --> 59:42.037

that this was a historical instance

59:42.120 --> 59:44.623
of Einstein and Picasso
meeting at a bar.

- It's a made-up.

They never met, as far as I know.

59:49.753 --> 59:51.481
- They didn't meet?
- No, I don't think they ever met.

59:51.505 --> 59:52.815
I thought the whole thing
was that they met...

59:52.839 --> 59:55.008
Well, it's called a play!

59:56.551 --> 59:58.553
- Yeah.

- I don't know.

"Make sure to give your camera

01:03:37.063 --> 01:03:39.941
to someone who doesn't know
how to use it."

01:03:40.608 --> 01:03:44.988
You know, Steve, there's a wonderful story
behind the expression, too much tuna.

01:03:45.071 --> 01:03:47.824
You see, years ago,
we used to drink tunatinis.

01:03:47.907 --> 01:03:50.410
Yeah, that's it. Tuna-fish-based Martini.

01:03:50.827 --> 01:03:53.246
Otherwise known as the Martuna.

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:57.625
Or as it was known in the lesbian
community, the Martuna Navratilova.

01:03:58.918 --> 01:04:01.004
The point is, we would drink fish.

01:04:01.087 --> 01:04:05.884
And one day, the bartender made a mistake
and Gil famously said,

01:04:05.967 --> 01:04:09.596
"There's too much tuna on my tunatini,

01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:13.308
but his Martuna needs <i>more </i> tuna,"

01:04:13.391 --> 01:04:15.518

No, I'm good.

That's adorable.

I end up having sex with the raccoon.

01:05:29.551 --> 01:05:32.303
You know, it's an open park, I saw it.

01:05:33.721 --> 01:05:37.016
- That's New York, you know what I mean?
- OK.

01:05:39.185 --> 01:05:43.815
New York used to be a city for artists
and people who claim to be artists,

01:05:43.898 --> 01:05:46.443
but those days are gone.

01:05:46.526 --> 01:05:50.572

There's no Disney theater.

01:14:20.831 --> 01:14:24.001
Oh, George, I had no idea.

01:14:24.377 --> 01:14:26.253
How can I ever tell anyone?

01:14:26.921 --> 01:14:32.301
Growing up in my family,
boys didn't lease Sorentos.

01:14:32.385 --> 01:14:35.054
'Cause Kia wasn't a car brand yet.

01:14:35.137 --> 01:14:39.141
It's such a recent brand.
I didn't know.

01:14:39.225 --> 01:14:43.104
All right, I'll do <i>Too Much Tuna</i>
on New York One with you.

01:14:43.187 --> 01:14:44.605
All right, Gil...

01:14:45.648 --> 01:14:46.899
But wait a moment.

01:14:47.483 --> 01:14:49.902
You're so quick to leave the park.

01:14:50.695 --> 01:14:52.655
Is everything OK with Lisa?

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:55.992
George, I just got a text message.

01:14:56.367 --> 01:15:00.204
It turns out that Lisa is a possum
with a burglar mask on!

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:04.208
- Again?
- Thrice!

01:15:05.459 --> 01:15:08.754
Thrice I've been doped
by false possums.

01:15:09.588 --> 01:15:13.592
Cheer up, Gil, 'cause we're gonna be
on New York One.

01:15:13.676 --> 01:15:18.723
The channel that comes on automatically
when you restart your cable box.

01:15:18.806 --> 01:15:24.186
New York One, the number one
channel chronologically!

01:15:24.478 --> 01:15:26.981
[high note]

01:15:31.527 --> 01:15:34.405
We are now at the midpoint of Act One.

01:15:36.282 --> 01:15:41.328
At this point in the play,
we're gonna add a surrealist ballet.

01:15:41.412 --> 01:15:43.831
Now, this is in hopes of winning

01:15:43.914 --> 01:15:47.334
the newly-created
Tony Award for choreography

01:15:47.418 --> 01:15:50.254
during a limited run vanity project.

01:15:51.213 --> 01:15:53.466
And we now humbly present,

01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:56.886
Gil and George's
dream dance sequence,

01:15:56.969 --> 01:15:59.638
which will take you and us

01:15:59.722 --> 01:16:02.850
way, way, way out of our comfort zones.

01:16:07.646 --> 01:16:10.691
This dance was choreographed
by an old Asian woman

01:16:10.775 --> 01:16:13.277
doing tai chi in Prospect Park.

01:16:14.361 --> 01:16:20.785
George and Gil descend the stairs
like two walking Swastikas.

01:16:22.161 --> 01:16:27.124
We are now in that cemetery
that you see on the way to LaGuardia.

01:16:29.418 --> 01:16:32.171
[making airplane noises]

01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:37.510
We see the grave of Ed Koch.

01:16:38.010 --> 01:16:39.970
The grave of Ed Koch,

01:16:40.054 --> 01:16:43.432
a symbol of a New York that has died.

01:16:43.516 --> 01:16:48.229
But from LaGuardia,
we see the beautiful New York skyline,

01:16:48.312 --> 01:16:51.941
with the paternal light phallus
of the Empire State Building.

01:16:52.024 --> 01:16:57.613
Work it. And the maternal light nipples
of the San Remo apartment towers.

01:16:58.030 --> 01:17:00.991
Oh, my God, look at the audience
getting all turned on.

01:17:01.075 --> 01:17:03.994
Like they're at a regional production
of <i>Chicago.</i>

01:17:04.787 --> 01:17:08.541
The front row trying to hide their boners
under a mountain of dry ice.

01:17:08.624 --> 01:17:11.168
You know, this is not a sex show.

01:17:11.252 --> 01:17:14.797
- This is primal art.
- This is prehistoric.

01:17:16.132 --> 01:17:19.176
Mother, Father.

01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:22.138
Mother, Father.

01:17:22.221 --> 01:17:25.141
Mother, Father.

01:17:25.224 --> 01:17:26.976
And baby?

01:17:29.103 --> 01:17:32.189
We see a tuna baby,
we must go to it.

01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:36.110
We go to care for our tuna baby, but...

01:17:36.193 --> 01:17:38.529
[tuna laughs]

01:17:38.612 --> 01:17:40.281
The baby is demonic.

01:17:40.364 --> 01:17:42.533
The baby is possessed by the devil

01:17:42.616 --> 01:17:45.452
like when Mia Farrow
had that evil child.

01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:47.580
- Soon-Yi?
- Correct.

01:17:48.289 --> 01:17:51.834
After a solid Soon-Yi burn, we run.

01:17:52.710 --> 01:17:56.172
- Gil, where are you?
- Where is my friend George?

01:17:56.255 --> 01:17:59.675
Gil, save yourself. Fly away.

01:17:59.758 --> 01:18:03.470
Oh, no. I don't need to fly.
I'll just run with you. It's fine.

01:18:03.554 --> 01:18:08.309
You remember, if you believe,
you can fly!

01:18:08.392 --> 01:18:10.311
George, I'm not really strapped in.

01:18:10.394 --> 01:18:13.272
It's not a good idea.
Fuck it, no. I'm not gonna do it.

01:18:13.355 --> 01:18:16.275
I saw too many productions
of <i>Spider-Man </i> where a guy died.

01:18:16.358 --> 01:18:17.776
I'm not doing it.

01:18:18.194 --> 01:18:23.073
Fine. Gil and George are now safe
from the tuna monster.

01:18:25.534 --> 01:18:28.370
[roar]

01:18:30.164 --> 01:18:35.753
[both] This looks expensive.

01:18:35.878 --> 01:18:38.505
[cackling]

01:18:42.134 --> 01:18:47.598
That's <i>Too Much Tuna...</i>

01:18:47.681 --> 01:18:50.517
trademark.

01:18:54.355 --> 01:18:57.650
There's so much production value.

01:18:59.151 --> 01:19:02.821
George and Gil are now legitimately dizzy
so they take a knee.

01:19:02.905 --> 01:19:06.033
And then a bridge pose,
and then a Martha Graham,

01:19:06.116 --> 01:19:07.993
and then we lay down.

01:19:09.286 --> 01:19:13.874
[applause]

01:19:19.171 --> 01:19:20.339
George...

01:19:20.422 --> 01:19:24.843
George and Gil now rest in real time
for, like, two minutes.

01:19:26.553 --> 01:19:27.930
Ravi.

01:19:28.305 --> 01:19:29.682
Ravi.

01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:31.558
It's George.

01:19:32.184 --> 01:19:33.769
I'm on the floor.

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:36.689
My blood sugar is crashing.

01:19:37.022 --> 01:19:41.777
Could you go get me
a Ferrero Rocher chocolate?

01:19:42.486 --> 01:19:46.282
Or a Lindt Lindor truffle?

01:19:47.032 --> 01:19:50.452
My favorite flavor is blue.

01:19:54.832 --> 01:19:58.544
Ravi, it's Gil Faizon, charmed I'm sure.

01:19:59.086 --> 01:20:00.963
Would you go to a bodega for me

01:20:01.046 --> 01:20:04.800
and get me a box
of Kashi Good Friends Cereal?

01:20:05.384 --> 01:20:09.138
The highest, dustiest box
you can find.

01:20:10.806 --> 01:20:12.141
Ravi.

01:20:12.683 --> 01:20:14.852
It's George, I'm on the floor.

01:20:15.519 --> 01:20:18.230
I need you to go to Just Salad,

01:20:19.106 --> 01:20:22.735
at like, 1 p.m.
when they're at their busiest.

01:20:23.319 --> 01:20:27.781
And just get on line and be like,
"Now, let's see, how does this work?"

01:20:33.037 --> 01:20:34.663
Ravi, it's Gil Faizon.

01:20:34.747 --> 01:20:38.584
Will you go to Chipotle
and get me a big bowl of Ebola?

01:20:40.836 --> 01:20:42.796
Ravi!

01:20:43.422 --> 01:20:46.967
Will you go to every pizza place
in New York

01:20:47.051 --> 01:20:51.430
and bring me the most sun-faded
headshot of Danny Aiello?

01:20:57.478 --> 01:21:00.356
Ravi, it's Gil Faizon, charmed,
I'm on the floor.

01:21:01.065 --> 01:21:03.442
Will you go to the Magnolia Bakery

01:21:03.525 --> 01:21:06.278
as featured in the <i>Sex and the City</i>
walking tour

01:21:06.362 --> 01:21:08.030
and just open fire?

01:21:13.535 --> 01:21:15.204
Ravi!

01:21:15.954 --> 01:21:20.376
Will you go to Long Island City, Queens,
'cause I won't.

01:21:24.797 --> 01:21:27.466
OK, nap time is over.

01:21:27.549 --> 01:21:29.343
Flash forward.

01:21:29.426 --> 01:21:31.512
One year later.

01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:36.892
George and Gil are on New York One
and living on top of the world.

01:21:37.351 --> 01:21:40.896
Gil can not stand up
because he has polenta body.

01:21:40.979 --> 01:21:43.357
Meaning, it all holds together

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:46.693
but it's soft
and absorbs tomato sauce.

01:21:47.027 --> 01:21:50.948
Gil is now standing like a toddler
in a YouTube video.

01:21:52.449 --> 01:21:54.618
Flash forward, one year later.

01:21:54.701 --> 01:21:58.455
<i>Too Much Tuna </i> is the huge hit show
in the whole Tri State Area,

01:21:58.539 --> 01:22:01.125
and George and Gil
are living the high life.

01:22:01.208 --> 01:22:04.753
They can get a table at the La Famiglia
Pizza in the port authority

01:22:04.837 --> 01:22:06.213
any time they want.

01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:11.176
George can finally afford
to fly JetBlue Mint

01:22:11.260 --> 01:22:14.096
from JFK all the way to LaGuardia.

01:22:15.431 --> 01:22:19.268
And Gil fulfills his life-long dream
of trying biscotti,

01:22:19.351 --> 01:22:21.061
and it is not worth it.

01:22:23.647 --> 01:22:25.274
George re-enters

01:22:25.357 --> 01:22:30.487
in a look that can only be described
as pussy safari.

01:22:31.655 --> 01:22:33.157
[techno music]

01:22:36.869 --> 01:22:41.123
We are now on the set of the corporate
and successful <i>Too Much Tuna.</i>

01:22:41.206 --> 01:22:44.293
God, people treat me so differently
now that I'm famous.

01:22:44.376 --> 01:22:49.047
It's like suddenly, jewelry stores
do have a bathroom I can use.

01:22:49.882 --> 01:22:51.758
Hey, what's up, everything?

01:22:52.217 --> 01:22:54.511
- Hey, space grandma.
- Oh, hi.

01:22:55.554 --> 01:22:58.348
Oh, good you got the craft services
that I like.

01:22:58.432 --> 01:23:01.143
Watermelon that's been in the fridge
for three weeks,

01:23:01.226 --> 01:23:03.937
so that when you eat it,
it's like spicy.

01:23:05.022 --> 01:23:06.899
Hey, Gil, let's take a press photo.

01:23:06.982 --> 01:23:08.150
[camera clicks]

01:23:08.317 --> 01:23:10.986
We're gonna be on the cover
of <i>Wired </i> magazine

01:23:11.069 --> 01:23:13.155
because anyone can be.

01:23:14.198 --> 01:23:15.908
Things really are changing.

01:23:15.991 --> 01:23:18.452
You know that black high school
that I walk by?

01:23:18.535 --> 01:23:21.955
The kids used to scream,
"Hey, shiboy fruity booty" or

01:23:22.039 --> 01:23:24.500
"Look at that mop-looking motherfucker."

01:23:25.626 --> 01:23:28.462
Now when I walk by,
they all just cackle and scream,

01:23:29.129 --> 01:23:31.256
"That cream-a-wheat nigga got a TV show."

01:23:32.299 --> 01:23:34.593
All right, let's get to work, everyone.

01:23:34.676 --> 01:23:36.512
Now that our mascot has arrived.

01:23:36.595 --> 01:23:40.891
- Hey, what's up, Tony?
- Hello, Tony Tuna, how was your weekend?

01:23:40.974 --> 01:23:43.644
Oh, my God, he's using again.

01:23:44.394 --> 01:23:47.231
I didn't want to say anything
but he's not going to meetings any more.

01:23:47.314 --> 01:23:48.357
Jesus!

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:51.318
It's that new girlfriend of his.
She's helping him do the cocaine.

01:23:51.401 --> 01:23:53.403
- 'Cause he ain't got no arms.
- Who, Tony?

01:23:53.487 --> 01:23:55.656
- No, he's a sandwich with eyeballs.
- [phone rings]

01:23:56.823 --> 01:23:58.867
- Oh, hello?
- Oh, hello?

01:24:00.494 --> 01:24:03.413
What? No, New York One,
please, that's unacceptable.

01:24:03.497 --> 01:24:06.041
What? This isn't a cellphone?

01:24:08.502 --> 01:24:11.505
Did you hear what New York One
is gonna do to our show?

01:24:11.588 --> 01:24:15.968
They want to turn us into clam show
called "That's A Lot-o Clamato"?

01:24:16.385 --> 01:24:18.095
Which is a terrible title.

01:24:18.178 --> 01:24:22.140
I would call it, "You Got Clam Juice,
You White Trash Idiot."

01:24:24.142 --> 01:24:25.519
George, uh,

01:24:25.602 --> 01:24:28.522
I don't know if you remember
but I said, I got to be Gil,

01:24:28.605 --> 01:24:32.651
I got to get out of this rat race.
I won't work for Clamato.

01:24:32.734 --> 01:24:34.152
Then neither of us will.

01:24:34.653 --> 01:24:37.948
Gil, we're gonna confront the president
of New York One,

01:24:38.031 --> 01:24:40.784
and tell him our integrity
is not for sale.

01:24:40.867 --> 01:24:43.579
Great! So let's take the subway, the 4-5?

01:24:43.662 --> 01:24:47.040
No, let's take the R and then walk.

01:24:47.457 --> 01:24:48.625
Shake!

01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:49.751
[dramatic music]

01:24:56.425 --> 01:24:58.635
The climax of the play.

01:24:59.136 --> 01:25:03.849
We are now in the plush, billion-dollar
headquarters of New York One.

01:25:04.349 --> 01:25:05.809
There's a glass trophy case,

01:25:05.892 --> 01:25:09.146
filled with Xeroxes
of other people's Emmy Awards.

01:25:09.938 --> 01:25:11.440
- George...
- Gil and...

01:25:11.523 --> 01:25:14.192
Gil and George,
armed with their integrity,

01:25:14.276 --> 01:25:18.071
- are ready to do battle with the evil...
- George, please, I just need...

01:25:18.155 --> 01:25:20.282
with the evil network president,

01:25:20.365 --> 01:25:23.619
who, tonight,
in a very special treat for us,

01:25:23.702 --> 01:25:25.203
and for everyone here,

01:25:25.287 --> 01:25:29.666
is played by Broadway legend,
Mr. Matthew Broderick!

01:25:30.417 --> 01:25:32.210
- Hold!
- Hold? Shit!

01:25:32.294 --> 01:25:35.297
Matthew, no. Don't come out.
We're on a hold.

01:25:35.380 --> 01:25:36.590
What's the hold?

01:25:36.673 --> 01:25:38.216
I got to go to the bathroom.

01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:41.595
- No, you're gonna hold it.
- I've been holding it since Steve Martin.

01:25:42.763 --> 01:25:44.723
Please. Please, do not do this to us, OK?

01:25:44.806 --> 01:25:47.017
You're an adult.
You can control your bowels.

01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:48.894
No, it's getting pointy.

01:25:49.186 --> 01:25:50.604
[audience laugh]

01:25:54.149 --> 01:25:56.026
Can we just take an intermission?

01:25:56.109 --> 01:25:58.195
No! No fucking intermission!

01:25:58.278 --> 01:26:00.197
They ruin the flow of the show.

01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:03.950
Would you stop the Super Bowl
halfway through to do a bunch of bullshit?

01:26:07.162 --> 01:26:09.956

to hold hands a long time ago,

this holding hands thing?"

01:38:16.057 --> 01:38:19.227
And look at you now,
you're in Hollywood and you're a big star.

01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:22.480
I'm a star of a small
action movie franchise

01:38:22.563 --> 01:38:26.275
where I play a secret agent
trying to protect his family called,

01:38:26.359 --> 01:38:29.112
"How dare you steal my daughter?"

01:38:36.536 --> 01:38:39.747
But me? You, you're the number one
novelist in America.

01:38:40.164 --> 01:38:45.962
I guess my young adult vampire series,
<i>Skateboard Dracula </i> is doing pretty well.

01:38:46.337 --> 01:38:50.341
Pretty well, 15 million copies
in one day ain't too shabby.

01:38:50.424 --> 01:38:53.344
Yeah, but most of those teens
only bought the book

01:38:53.427 --> 01:38:56.305
because in it,
I explained how to make a bomb.

01:38:57.807 --> 01:38:58.808
[tuts]

01:39:01.561 --> 01:39:04.647
- Is that your new novel?
- This? No.

01:39:05.064 --> 01:39:07.024
A new play I'm working on.

01:39:07.817 --> 01:39:10.069
Frankly, it's about me and you.

01:39:10.153 --> 01:39:14.532
Well, Tony Tuna and <i>Too Much Tuna</i>
and raccoons,

01:39:15.324 --> 01:39:17.201
and finding your way in the world.

01:39:27.962 --> 01:39:31.674
George, this is the best play
I've ever read.

01:39:32.258 --> 01:39:33.426
Thank you.

01:39:33.926 --> 01:39:36.888
- I guess I just have one question.
- Of course.

01:39:38.598 --> 01:39:40.224
How does it end?

01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:44.395
Why don't we find out together?

01:39:51.152 --> 01:39:52.695
New York City.

01:39:53.696 --> 01:39:55.281
A million people.

01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:01.454
A million different stories.

01:40:02.330 --> 01:40:06.167
And that's not even counting...
the commuters.

01:40:09.921 --> 01:40:12.882
Oh, waiter, I'll have...

01:40:15.801 --> 01:40:20.848
Well, I'll have two more
root beers, please.

01:40:24.644 --> 01:40:27.396
[applause]

01:40:33.319 --> 01:40:36.781
[music]

01:40:48.251 --> 01:40:49.877
Ravi in the booth.

01:40:50.253 --> 01:40:52.672

01:40:59.011 --> 01:41:01.305

01:41:01.722 --> 01:41:04.976

01:41:07.979 --> 01:41:11.065
- Could you get us a couple of slices?
- Get one for yourself.

01:41:11.816 --> 01:41:13.401
- Pizza you want?
- Pizza is nice.

01:41:13.484 --> 01:41:14.902
You want pizza?
