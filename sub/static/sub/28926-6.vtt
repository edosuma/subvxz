El has saved the world twice,
and Mike still doesn't trust her.

23:07.928 --> 23:11.181
You wanna talk about trust, really?
After you made Eleven spy on us?

23:11.681 --> 23:13.558
-Wait, what?
-Oh, she didn't tell you this?

23:13.642 --> 23:15.977
-No.
-Your girlfriend used El's powers

23:16.061 --> 23:18.438
-to spy on us.
-No, no, no, I did not  make  her.

23:18.522 --> 23:19.648
It was  her  idea.

23:19.731 --> 23:21.691
And why are we even talking about this,
seriously?

23:21.775 --> 23:22.901
Yeah, who cares?

23:22.984 --> 23:23.819
-I care.
-Yeah.

23:23.902 --> 23:26.822
-I guess girlfriends don't lie, they spy.
-We were just joking around.

23:26.905 --> 23:29.741
Wouldn't it've been so funny if I was
taking a massive shit or something?

23:29.825 --> 23:32.035
-You weren't.
-But what if I was?

23:32.119 --> 23:33.703
-Then gross!
-Seriously, Mike?

23:33.787 --> 23:36.581
I'm just trying to demonstrate
how careless Max is with Eleven's powers.

23:36.665 --> 23:37.958
In fact, how careless all of you are.

23:38.041 --> 23:40.544
You're treating her like some kind
of machine when she's not a machine,

23:40.627 --> 23:42.337
and I don't want her to die
looking for the flayed

23:42.421 --> 23:44.256
when they've obviously vanished
off the face of the Earth.

23:44.339 --> 23:45.966
So can we please just come up
with a new plan

23:46.049 --> 23:47.968
because I love her
and I can't lose her again.

23:52.389 --> 23:53.265
[door opening]

23:56.435 --> 23:57.769
What's going on?

23:57.853 --> 23:59.479
Nothing. Nothing.

23:59.563 --> 24:00.856
Just a family discussion.

24:01.314 --> 24:02.149
Oh.

24:05.610 --> 24:06.653
I found him.

24:07.446 --> 24:09.406
Found who?

24:13.827 --> 24:17.914
[Murray] He calls it the key,
and this key emits a great energy.

24:17.998 --> 24:19.499
[Alexei speaking Russian]

24:20.167 --> 24:22.669
[Murray] It requires much strength, power.

24:23.128 --> 24:25.338
[Alexei speaking Russian]

24:25.422 --> 24:27.424
[Murray] Those houses,
like the one you found,

24:27.674 --> 24:30.135
they're located near, uh, transformers.

24:30.677 --> 24:33.096
They're stealing
from your town's power grid.

24:33.180 --> 24:36.475
Why build this key here? Why are they not
doing this in their own backyard?

24:36.558 --> 24:38.518
What are they trying to do,
blow us to smithereens?

24:38.602 --> 24:41.521
[speaking Russian]

24:42.397 --> 24:44.941
[speaking Russian]

24:45.025 --> 24:45.859
[chuckles lightly]

24:45.942 --> 24:47.944
[speaking Russian]

24:48.028 --> 24:50.989
There were many of these, uh, keys before
in Russia,

24:51.072 --> 24:53.158
but they turned out wrong.

24:53.241 --> 24:54.242
[Alexei speaking Russian]

24:54.326 --> 24:56.411
They had to come to where the...
where the, uh...

24:56.995 --> 24:57.829
Where the what?

24:57.913 --> 25:00.373
-I don't understand what he's saying.
-I thought you were fluent.

25:00.457 --> 25:01.500
Oh, I'm sorry.

25:01.583 --> 25:04.377
Are my free translation services
not good enough for you?

25:04.461 --> 25:07.422
Because you can just go ahead
and file your complaint

25:07.506 --> 25:09.090
right up my ass!

25:10.842 --> 25:12.093
What is Smirnoff doing?

25:12.177 --> 25:15.013
-He's showing me.
-[speaking Russian]

25:17.224 --> 25:18.183
[Murray] Oh, okay.

25:18.266 --> 25:20.477
Uh, he says the straw,

25:20.560 --> 25:23.939
they're using it to penetrate a hole

25:24.022 --> 25:26.358
in... a box?

25:26.983 --> 25:29.402
[speaking Russian]

25:31.154 --> 25:32.739
Okay, sorry, sorry.

25:32.822 --> 25:35.825
[Murray] The straw represents the key,
which emits a great energy.

25:35.909 --> 25:37.619
[speaking Russian]

25:38.745 --> 25:40.497
They're using this energy...

25:41.706 --> 25:44.709
to break through a barrier,

25:45.252 --> 25:47.003
to open...

25:47.379 --> 25:48.421
a doorway.

25:49.714 --> 25:51.424
A doorway between worlds.

25:57.055 --> 25:59.307
[Alexei speaking Russian]

26:00.475 --> 26:03.103
[Murray] But it seems this key
was only half the equation.

26:03.186 --> 26:04.020
[speaking Russian]

26:04.104 --> 26:06.356
Location-- Location was the other half.

26:09.109 --> 26:09.985
[speaking Russian]

26:10.068 --> 26:11.653
Oh, what--

26:12.112 --> 26:13.780
[speaking Russian]

26:13.863 --> 26:16.992
In Hawkins,
this door had been opened once.

26:17.075 --> 26:18.118
[speaking Russian]

26:20.120 --> 26:21.371
It was still...

26:22.706 --> 26:23.707
healing.

26:28.795 --> 26:30.005
Jesus Christ.

26:30.088 --> 26:32.549
So, this door is open now?

26:32.632 --> 26:34.342
[speaking Russian]

26:34.926 --> 26:36.553
[speaking Russian]

26:37.012 --> 26:38.847
He says it is...

26:39.806 --> 26:40.724
opening.

26:42.434 --> 26:45.020
-[creature shrieking]
-[fluttering sound]

26:45.103 --> 26:46.855
[gasps]

26:47.314 --> 26:49.941
-Where are you going?
-To call our children.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.277
[gasps]

26:53.403 --> 26:55.447
[in Russian]
Can we watch  Looney Tunes  now?

26:55.947 --> 26:56.948
Nyet.

26:57.032 --> 26:58.783
[big band music playing]

26:59.951 --> 27:01.119
[panting]

27:01.411 --> 27:02.370
[grumbling]

27:05.540 --> 27:07.542
-Can I help you with something?
-Whiskey.

27:07.876 --> 27:10.962
-You have whiskey?
-No, but I do have vodka.

27:14.299 --> 27:15.925
[Hopper sighs]

27:33.693 --> 27:35.445
-[Hopper inhales sharply]
-Oh!

27:37.530 --> 27:40.533
If there's a way to start this key,
there's gotta be a way to stop it, yeah?

27:40.784 --> 27:41.868
Turn it off?

27:45.830 --> 27:47.540
-[Hopper inhales sharply]
-[Murray sighs]

27:47.999 --> 27:49.125
-Right.
-Right?

27:53.046 --> 27:55.131
[in Russian]
The key, is there a way to turn it off?

27:56.049 --> 27:58.051
[speaking Russian]

27:58.134 --> 28:00.553
[in English] He says,
"Of course he could turn it off. Could...

28:00.845 --> 28:03.973
Edison not turn off a lamp,
could Bell not hang up a phone?"

28:04.391 --> 28:06.184
Cocky bastard. "But..."

28:06.267 --> 28:07.602
But what?

28:07.686 --> 28:08.645
[speaking Russian]

28:08.728 --> 28:09.896
But he is now...

28:10.730 --> 28:11.564
"naked."

28:13.692 --> 28:15.985
Sorry, "exposed." Compromised.

28:16.820 --> 28:19.280
Hey, I will get you there.

28:19.781 --> 28:22.325
I will get you to your key.

28:22.742 --> 28:24.744
[speaking Russian]

28:28.832 --> 28:30.959
[laughs]

28:35.672 --> 28:37.716
You wanna ask him what the hell's
so funny about that?

28:37.799 --> 28:39.342
[speaking Russian]

28:39.426 --> 28:40.802
[speaking Russian]

28:45.390 --> 28:47.016
He says he likes your courage.

28:47.600 --> 28:48.601
You remind him of a...

28:48.685 --> 28:49.769
[clears throat]

28:50.103 --> 28:51.229
...fat Rambo.

28:53.106 --> 28:54.858
[Alexei speaking Russian]

28:55.066 --> 28:57.819
[Murray] But he says that even thin Rambo
couldn't get there.

28:57.902 --> 28:58.987
[Alexei speaking Russian]

28:59.070 --> 29:02.574
This key, it is in an underground fortress

29:03.032 --> 29:05.994
designed by the greatest Russian minds,

29:06.077 --> 29:08.955
guarded by their greatest warriors.

29:09.414 --> 29:11.624
[speaking Russian]

29:11.708 --> 29:13.001
[Murray] Breaking in is...

29:14.294 --> 29:15.170
impossible.

29:27.265 --> 29:28.224
Jackpot.

29:39.527 --> 29:40.570
[Dustin] Oh-ho-ho!

29:42.071 --> 29:43.656
Do you even know how to drive?

29:43.740 --> 29:45.742
How hard can it be? Max did it.

29:46.201 --> 29:48.203
-[Dustin] Aw, come on.
-You seriously thought

29:48.286 --> 29:50.705
-they'd just leave keys in there?
-There's gotta be a spare.

29:50.789 --> 29:51.748
[Erica sighs]

30:01.257 --> 30:03.134
-[Erica] Hey, Dustin?
-Yeah?

30:03.927 --> 30:06.346
How big did you say that Demogorgon was?

30:06.429 --> 30:08.306
Big. Nine feet or so. Why?

30:21.110 --> 30:21.945
Found 'em.

30:24.447 --> 30:25.281
Erica?

30:25.365 --> 30:26.282
[loud zapping]

30:26.366 --> 30:27.575
What the hell is that?!

30:27.659 --> 30:28.868
A deadly weapon.

30:29.202 --> 30:30.203
Could be useful.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.414
-For what?
-What do you think?

30:33.498 --> 30:35.667
Taking down Commies, saving your friends.

30:35.750 --> 30:37.961
Thought you were more realistic than that,
nerd.

30:38.378 --> 30:39.712
We don't even know where they are,

30:39.796 --> 30:41.923
and even if we did,
there are a million guards up there

30:42.006 --> 30:43.842
with weapons way deadlier than that.

30:44.175 --> 30:47.679
The best thing we can do for them
is to get out of here and find help.

30:47.762 --> 30:48.721
Easy with that.

30:48.805 --> 30:51.558
Our chance of surviving, and theirs,
rises substantially.

30:51.641 --> 30:53.560
Just trust me on this. Please?

30:56.604 --> 30:58.815
[engine powering up]

31:00.733 --> 31:02.068
[Robin] Help!

31:02.151 --> 31:03.653
[Robin's voice echoes]

31:03.736 --> 31:05.238
Help!

31:06.614 --> 31:10.034
-Help!
-Hey, would you stop yelling?

31:10.118 --> 31:11.703
Steve! Oh, my God!

31:11.911 --> 31:13.454
[panting] Steve...

31:14.789 --> 31:15.957
Are-- Are you okay?

31:16.416 --> 31:18.251
My ears are ringing,
and I can't really breathe,

31:18.334 --> 31:20.461
my eye feels
like it's about to pop out of my skull,

31:20.545 --> 31:24.132
but, you know, apart from that,
I'm doing pretty good.

31:24.215 --> 31:28.011
Well, the good news is that
they're calling you a doctor.

31:28.469 --> 31:29.429
[Robin chuckles]

31:31.014 --> 31:32.390
Is this his place of work?

31:32.473 --> 31:34.100
-I love the vibe.
-[Robin chuckles]

31:34.183 --> 31:35.018
Charming.

31:35.101 --> 31:37.520
Yeah, tell me about it. So, okay,

31:37.604 --> 31:40.523
do you see that table over there
to your right? No, your other right.

31:40.607 --> 31:41.900
-Oh.
-Yeah, okay.

31:42.483 --> 31:44.319
-And do you see those scissors?
-Uh-huh.

31:44.402 --> 31:48.323
Yeah, well, I think that if we move
at the same time, we could get over there,

31:48.406 --> 31:50.950
and then maybe I could kick the table
and knock them into your lap.

31:51.034 --> 31:53.453
-And I could cut the binds.
-Yeah, and we could get out of here.

31:53.536 --> 31:55.538
-Gotcha. Okay, yeah, we can do that.
-Yeah.

31:55.622 --> 31:57.206
Those morons. They left scissors in here?

31:57.290 --> 31:59.208
-Yeah, morons. [laughs]
-Total morons.

31:59.292 --> 32:01.044
-Okay.
-Okay, so,

32:01.127 --> 32:02.962
on the count of three, we're gonna hop.

32:03.046 --> 32:05.340
-Okay, good, hop on three. I gotcha.
-All right.

32:05.423 --> 32:07.926
One, two, three.

32:09.594 --> 32:11.095
-Okay, that worked.
-Okay.

32:11.179 --> 32:12.680
-All right. Uh, let's try again.
-Right.

32:12.764 --> 32:14.432
[both] One, two, three.

32:14.974 --> 32:17.060
-Holy shit, this is gonna work!
-We're close. Ready?

32:17.143 --> 32:19.312
Okay, one, two, three.

32:19.395 --> 32:20.563
[both grunting]

32:20.647 --> 32:21.564
[both groaning]

32:23.566 --> 32:24.984
[laughing lightly]

32:25.526 --> 32:27.111
It's okay, it's okay.

32:27.195 --> 32:28.821
Don't cry. Robin.

32:29.864 --> 32:31.199
[Robin giggles]

32:31.699 --> 32:32.951
Are you laughing?

32:33.034 --> 32:34.035
[continues laughing]

32:34.577 --> 32:36.579
-Yeah.
-Jesus!

32:36.996 --> 32:38.247
I'm sorry!

32:40.541 --> 32:42.085
I'm so sorry. It's just...

32:42.794 --> 32:43.920
I can't believe...

32:44.545 --> 32:47.256
I'm gonna die in a secret Russian base

32:47.340 --> 32:48.841
with Steve "The Hair" Harrington.

32:49.342 --> 32:51.761
-It's just too trippy, man.
-We're not gonna die.

32:51.844 --> 32:53.304
We're gonna get out of here, okay?

32:53.388 --> 32:55.640
Just-- You gotta let me
just think for a second.

32:56.933 --> 33:00.478
Do you remember, um,
Mrs. Click's sophomore history class?

33:02.939 --> 33:03.856
What?

33:03.940 --> 33:05.775
Mrs. Clickity-Clackity.

33:06.359 --> 33:08.528
That's what us band dweebs called her.

33:09.487 --> 33:11.489
-[sighs]
-It was first period,

33:12.657 --> 33:15.660
Tuesdays and Thursdays,
so you were always late.

33:16.869 --> 33:19.747
And you always had the same breakfast.

33:20.748 --> 33:23.459
Bacon, egg, and cheese
on a sesame bagel.

33:24.669 --> 33:25.795
I sat behind you

33:26.713 --> 33:28.715
two days a week for a year.

33:29.632 --> 33:30.675
Mister Funny.

33:31.551 --> 33:32.593
Mister Cool.

33:33.761 --> 33:35.680
The King of Hawkins High himself.

33:38.057 --> 33:40.184
Do you even remember me
from that class?

33:42.520 --> 33:43.521
[Robin chuckles]

33:44.105 --> 33:45.356
Of course you don't.

33:46.941 --> 33:48.985
You were a real asshole, you know that?

33:49.068 --> 33:50.486
Yeah, I know.

33:51.112 --> 33:52.447
But it didn't even matter.

33:52.530 --> 33:54.240
It didn't matter that you were an ass.

33:54.323 --> 33:55.783
I was still...

33:56.284 --> 33:57.827
obsessed with you.

33:58.453 --> 34:00.997
Even though all of us losers
pretend to be above it all,

34:01.080 --> 34:03.458
we still just wanna be popular...

34:05.293 --> 34:06.210
accepted,

34:06.627 --> 34:07.462
normal.

34:08.212 --> 34:11.424
If it makes you feel any better,
having those things isn't all that great.

34:11.883 --> 34:13.009
Seriously.

34:13.342 --> 34:15.011
[sighs] It just baffles me.

34:15.094 --> 34:17.430
Everything that people tell you
is important,

34:17.513 --> 34:20.683
everything that people say
you should care about, it's all just...

34:20.767 --> 34:21.684
[chuckles]

34:23.144 --> 34:24.145
...bullshit.

34:25.563 --> 34:28.691
But I guess you gotta mess up
to figure things out, right?

34:28.775 --> 34:29.901
I hope so.

34:30.359 --> 34:32.320
I feel like my whole life has been...

34:33.279 --> 34:34.864
one big error.

34:34.947 --> 34:36.074
[chuckles]

34:36.616 --> 34:38.201
Yep. [laughs]

34:38.284 --> 34:40.787
At least it can't get any more messed up
than this.

34:40.870 --> 34:42.246
[both chuckle]

34:42.330 --> 34:44.332
You know, I wish I'd known you
in Click's class.

34:44.415 --> 34:46.292
-Yeah?
-Really, I do.

34:46.375 --> 34:47.335
[Robin chuckles]

34:47.543 --> 34:49.462
Maybe you could've helped me
pass the class.

34:50.254 --> 34:53.382
Maybe instead of being here,
I'd be on my way to college right now.

34:53.466 --> 34:56.010
And I would have no idea

34:56.344 --> 34:58.471
that there were evil Russians
beneath our feet,

34:58.554 --> 35:02.600
and I would be happily slinging ice cream
with some other schmuck.

35:02.683 --> 35:04.560
[both chuckle]

35:05.561 --> 35:06.604
Gotta say, though,

35:06.979 --> 35:08.356
I liked being your schmuck.

35:09.524 --> 35:10.983
It was fun while it lasted.

35:12.193 --> 35:13.069
It was.

35:14.028 --> 35:15.321
-[buzzer sounds]
-[door opens]

35:15.780 --> 35:17.573
[suspenseful music playing]

35:18.658 --> 35:19.659
[chuckles]

35:20.284 --> 35:21.744
Where were you two going?

35:23.371 --> 35:24.747
[clicking tongue]

35:31.796 --> 35:34.340
Try telling the truth this time, yes?

35:34.423 --> 35:38.594
It will make your visit with Dr. Zharkov
less painful.

35:39.804 --> 35:40.888
[winces]

35:42.723 --> 35:43.599
[chuckles]

35:48.479 --> 35:49.772
Wait a second. Wait. Hold on.

35:49.856 --> 35:51.941
Okay! Wait, wait, wait!
What is that thing?

35:52.024 --> 35:53.568
It will help you talk.

35:54.110 --> 35:55.361
Did you even clean that thing?!

35:55.444 --> 35:57.321
[screams]

35:57.405 --> 35:59.323
[static hissing]

36:10.960 --> 36:11.794
[gasping breaths]

36:16.424 --> 36:19.010
[Eleven breathes rapidly]

36:20.344 --> 36:23.222
[gasping, panting]

36:23.639 --> 36:24.849
What's he doing now?

36:34.233 --> 36:35.776
[Nancy] And that's not normal, right?

36:35.860 --> 36:38.196
Billy staying in his room
on the Fourth of July?

36:38.279 --> 36:39.614
No, that's not normal.

36:39.697 --> 36:41.657
He wants us to find him.

36:41.741 --> 36:43.159
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

36:43.242 --> 36:46.787
If we go to Billy, then the rest
of the flayed know where we are.

36:46.871 --> 36:48.998
It's a trap, I agree. We'll be ambushed.

36:49.081 --> 36:50.208
We won't be surprised.

36:50.625 --> 36:54.295
We'll know that they're coming,
and we will kick their flayed butts.

36:54.378 --> 36:56.130
You mean El will kick their butts.

37:05.264 --> 37:06.599
[Eleven's voice echoes]  Papa!

37:06.682 --> 37:07.600
No.

37:08.768 --> 37:11.145
[Terry]  Rainbow.
Three to the right, four to the left.

37:11.979 --> 37:13.356
Sunflower. Rainbow.

37:15.149 --> 37:17.610
-[Mike] It's too risky.
-[Nancy] Yeah, and unnecessary.

37:17.693 --> 37:19.862
Killing the flayed
won't stop the Mind Flayer.

37:19.946 --> 37:21.822
We have to find out where
it's spreading from.

37:21.906 --> 37:23.866
We have to find the source.

37:23.950 --> 37:25.034
[Eleven] Billy knows it.

37:25.117 --> 37:26.577
Billy's been there.

37:28.120 --> 37:29.080
To the source.

37:29.163 --> 37:31.457
-Yeah, but--
-It's a trap. I know.

37:32.291 --> 37:34.001
[Eleven] We can't go to Billy,

37:34.460 --> 37:38.089
but I think there's another way.

37:38.673 --> 37:41.259
A way for me to see where he's been.

37:44.428 --> 37:46.180
[static hissing]

37:49.225 --> 37:52.561
El, I know you think you have to do this,
but you don't.

37:53.145 --> 37:55.731
It's just,
you've only done this before once.

37:55.815 --> 37:58.359
And your mom, she loved you,

37:58.859 --> 38:00.611
and wanted you to know what happened.

38:00.695 --> 38:03.239
And Billy's mind is-- is sick, diseased.

38:03.781 --> 38:05.283
The Mind Flayer is in him.

38:06.742 --> 38:07.994
He can't hurt me.

38:08.536 --> 38:09.578
Not in there.

38:09.662 --> 38:10.705
We don't know that.

38:13.833 --> 38:14.709
Mike.

38:16.836 --> 38:18.754
I need you to trust me.

38:23.509 --> 38:24.343
Yeah.

38:24.802 --> 38:26.095
Just... be careful.

38:44.238 --> 38:46.032
[shivering breaths]

39:06.802 --> 39:07.928
[Eleven exhales sharply]

39:30.534 --> 39:31.619
[echoing] Billy.

39:35.164 --> 39:36.832
Can you hear me?

39:39.293 --> 39:40.711
I want to see.

39:41.212 --> 39:43.214
I want to see what happened.

39:49.053 --> 39:50.429
[suspenseful synth music playing]

39:51.972 --> 39:52.973
[whimpering]

39:53.057 --> 39:54.058
Something's wrong.

39:58.270 --> 40:01.482
[screams] Stop! No! No! No!

40:01.565 --> 40:02.691
No!

40:05.486 --> 40:06.654
[distorted roaring]

40:11.784 --> 40:12.993

40:14.453 --> 40:15.788

40:32.471 --> 40:34.849
[distorted wailing]

40:41.313 --> 40:43.065
[Mike, echoing]  El, are you okay?

40:43.983 --> 40:45.359
Are you okay?

40:46.110 --> 40:47.069
[sighs]

40:47.486 --> 40:48.863
[softly] I'm okay.

40:49.447 --> 40:50.448
What's going on?

40:50.531 --> 40:52.992
I'm... on a beach.

40:53.701 --> 40:55.703
[Lucas] Okay, I may be dense,

40:56.203 --> 40:57.538
but the last I checked,

40:58.247 --> 41:00.291
there weren't any beaches in Hawkins.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.251
What else do you see?

41:04.253 --> 41:05.254
[tides crashing]

41:06.088 --> 41:08.007
[seagulls squawking]

41:09.633 --> 41:10.801
[Eleven]  A woman.

41:12.595 --> 41:13.471
She's...

41:14.930 --> 41:15.764
pretty.

41:17.850 --> 41:18.726
I...

41:19.935 --> 41:21.687
I think she's looking at me.

41:21.770 --> 41:23.397
[echoing laughter]

41:23.939 --> 41:25.524
[woman] Woo!

41:25.608 --> 41:26.942
Yeah!

41:27.026 --> 41:28.027
[woman laughs]

41:33.032 --> 41:34.116
[woman] You did it!

41:34.783 --> 41:35.784
There's...

41:36.494 --> 41:37.453
a boy.

41:37.536 --> 41:38.996
Did you see that?

41:39.079 --> 41:40.247
Yeah, I saw that!

41:40.623 --> 41:42.041
That was at least seven feet.

41:42.124 --> 41:44.668
[woman] I don't know what it was,
but it almost gave me a heart attack.

41:44.752 --> 41:45.878
Ten more minutes?

41:47.421 --> 41:49.757
-Yeah, okay, ten more minutes.
-Okay.

41:49.840 --> 41:52.259
But any longer than that,
Dad's gonna be mad, okay?

41:52.343 --> 41:53.219
[boy] Okay!

41:53.302 --> 41:54.345
[boy panting]

41:55.346 --> 41:56.555
Billy?

41:57.890 --> 41:59.433
Watch out for rip currents!

41:59.934 --> 42:00.809
I know.

42:01.727 --> 42:02.645
It's Billy.

42:04.730 --> 42:06.148
It's California.

42:06.815 --> 42:07.858
It's a memory.

42:12.905 --> 42:14.156
[seagulls squawking]

42:14.240 --> 42:15.658
[distant rumbling]

42:16.158 --> 42:17.660
I think I see it.

42:18.994 --> 42:20.287

[dialing on rotary phone]

42:43.811 --> 42:45.271
[Murray] Two minutes, Jim.

42:45.354 --> 42:48.023
It's a secure line, but any longer
than that and they could trace you.

42:48.107 --> 42:49.233
Yeah, I want 'em to trace me.

42:49.316 --> 42:50.442
-What?
-[Hopper clears throat]

42:50.526 --> 42:52.861

Philadelphia Public Library.

42:56.699 --> 42:59.410
Uh...

42:59.493 --> 43:01.870
This is Jim Hopper...

43:01.954 --> 43:04.206
uh... police chief, Hawkins.

43:04.290 --> 43:06.750
[Hopper]  I got this number
from Dr. Sam Owens.

43:07.167 --> 43:08.669
What is your identification code?

43:08.752 --> 43:09.962
Identification code?

43:10.045 --> 43:10.921
You don't know it?

43:11.005 --> 43:12.172
You must be joking.

43:12.256 --> 43:13.716
Oh, no, no, I got it, I got it.

43:13.799 --> 43:15.175
[chuckles] I got it.

43:15.259 --> 43:18.637
You wrote it down and kept it
in your wallet?

43:21.015 --> 43:22.975
"Antique Chariot." Listen.

43:23.058 --> 43:26.687
[Hopper]  Um, tell Owens that the Russkies
are opening the gate.

43:26.770 --> 43:27.771
Now, he'll know what that means.

43:27.855 --> 43:29.607
Not about the Russkies,
but about the gate.

43:29.690 --> 43:32.735
Tell him that there's an entrance
at Starcourt Mall.

43:32.818 --> 43:34.194
I know how to get in,

43:34.278 --> 43:35.821
but I need backup, a lot of backup.

43:35.904 --> 43:39.658
Have him call me back here
at 618-625-8313.

43:39.742 --> 43:41.243
Your message will be relayed.

43:44.455 --> 43:46.832
-So, now what?
-Now, we, uh...

43:47.875 --> 43:48.834
we wait.

43:48.917 --> 43:50.169
You compromised me, Jim.

43:50.252 --> 43:52.921
You do realize that, don't you?
I'm gonna have to relocate.

43:53.005 --> 43:55.049
-How long do we wait?
-As long as it takes.

43:55.132 --> 43:57.384
How can you just sit there being calm?

43:57.468 --> 43:58.969
I am not calm!

43:59.053 --> 44:00.721
Our kids are in danger!

44:00.804 --> 44:02.806
You said they were at the festival!

44:02.890 --> 44:05.809
Which is, like, ten minutes from the gate!

44:07.061 --> 44:07.978
[scoffs]

44:08.479 --> 44:10.689
What are you doing? Joyce?

44:10.773 --> 44:12.191
What are you doing?

44:12.274 --> 44:13.359
[phone rings]

44:14.193 --> 44:15.736
Philadelphia Public Library.

44:15.819 --> 44:16.862
Yes, hello.

44:16.945 --> 44:19.823
Uh, this is,
uh, Antique Chariot's partner...

44:20.366 --> 44:21.575
Wheelbarrow.

44:21.659 --> 44:23.702
I don't think Antique Chariot

44:23.786 --> 44:27.039
properly conveyed the urgency
of our situation.

44:27.122 --> 44:28.374
What are you doing?

44:28.457 --> 44:30.459
Can't just sit around and wait for a call.

44:30.542 --> 44:32.753
-Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to stay calm.
-No.

44:32.836 --> 44:35.339
Don't you dare patronize me!

44:35.422 --> 44:37.216
I don't know who you are,

44:37.299 --> 44:39.968
if you're some glorified secretary
or what,

44:40.052 --> 44:43.097
but if you don't wanna lose your job,
here's what's gonna happen.

44:43.180 --> 44:44.390
When I hang up,

44:44.473 --> 44:46.100
you're gonna get up off your ass,

44:46.183 --> 44:48.811
and you're gonna go find Owens
and tell him what's going on.

44:48.894 --> 44:52.106
We don't have time to talk about it
and neither does he.

44:52.189 --> 44:56.402
He's gotta get to Hawkins,
and he's gotta bring his men right now!

44:56.485 --> 44:57.986
Do you understand me?

44:58.070 --> 44:59.238
Yes, yes, ma'am.

44:59.321 --> 45:01.490
Thank you. And good day.

45:02.324 --> 45:05.285
It's been exactly one minute, Joyce.

45:05.369 --> 45:06.912
That's one minute too long.

45:09.248 --> 45:10.207
-Alexei.
-[gasps]

45:10.290 --> 45:11.500
[in Russian] What's going on?

45:11.750 --> 45:13.043
We gotta go. Vroom, vroom.

45:13.127 --> 45:14.670
Back to Hawkins. Come on.

45:15.129 --> 45:16.171
[Joyce] Come on.

45:30.728 --> 45:32.688
Honestly, I don't really feel anything.

45:33.355 --> 45:34.356
Do you?

45:35.065 --> 45:37.568
I mean, I... I feel fine.

45:38.068 --> 45:40.154
-I feel normal.
-Yeah, I feel-- I feel fine.

45:41.363 --> 45:42.656
I kinda feel good.

45:42.740 --> 45:44.533
[both chuckling]

45:45.576 --> 45:46.910
-Wanna know a secret?
-What?

45:46.994 --> 45:48.245
I like it, too!

45:48.328 --> 45:50.372
[both laugh]

45:50.956 --> 45:53.584
-I feel good.
-Morons. They messed up the drug.

45:53.667 --> 45:55.085
They messed it up!

45:56.003 --> 45:59.047
-Morons. Hey, morons!
-Morons!

45:59.131 --> 46:00.716
-Moron! Mor--
-Hey!

46:00.799 --> 46:02.050
Whoa-oh!

46:02.718 --> 46:04.970
Oh, no. There's definitely
something wrong with us.

46:05.053 --> 46:06.889
-Something's wrong.
-[door buzzer sounds]

46:20.319 --> 46:21.361
[Robin chuckles]

46:23.822 --> 46:26.992
Would now be a good time to tell you
that I don't like doctors?

46:28.952 --> 46:31.955
Let's try this again, yes?

46:32.748 --> 46:33.707
[murmurs]

46:33.791 --> 46:35.250
Who do you work for?

46:36.001 --> 46:37.461
Scoops. [chuckles]

46:37.544 --> 46:38.420
Scoops Ahoy.

46:38.504 --> 46:40.464
[giggles]

46:40.923 --> 46:42.299
How did you find us?

46:42.382 --> 46:43.842
Totally by accident. [chuckles]

46:44.468 --> 46:45.302
[Steve chuckles]

46:45.385 --> 46:46.345
[in Russian] More lies.

46:50.849 --> 46:54.061
-What is that shiny little toy?
-[Robin] Where you going with that, doc?

46:54.144 --> 46:57.022
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey.
Wait! No! Wait! Wait!

46:57.105 --> 46:59.608
-Whoa!
-There was a code! We heard a code!

47:00.234 --> 47:01.151
Code.

47:02.277 --> 47:03.237
What code?

47:03.320 --> 47:04.530
"The week is long.

47:04.613 --> 47:06.990
The silver cat feeds
when blue meets yellow in the west."

47:07.074 --> 47:08.200
Blah, blah, blah.

47:08.283 --> 47:13.413
You broadcast that stupid spy shit
all over town,

47:13.497 --> 47:14.873
and we picked it up on our Cerebro,

47:14.957 --> 47:17.417
and we cracked it in a day.

47:17.960 --> 47:19.002
A day!

47:19.086 --> 47:21.505
You think you're so smart,

47:21.588 --> 47:25.509
but a couple of kids
who scoop ice cream for a living

47:25.592 --> 47:28.887
cracked your code in a day,
and now, people know you're here.

47:28.971 --> 47:31.014
Who knows we are here, little bitch?

47:31.098 --> 47:32.224
Uh, well, Dustin knows.

47:32.307 --> 47:33.433
Hey, Steve?

47:33.517 --> 47:35.686
-Yeah, Dustin Henderson, he knows.
-Steve!

47:35.769 --> 47:37.855
-[Steve laughs]
-Dustin Henderson.

47:38.438 --> 47:41.024
It is your small, curly-haired friend?

47:41.108 --> 47:44.194
Oh, curly-haired. Great hair. Small.
Kind of like a 'fro. Yeah.

47:44.278 --> 47:45.237
Where is he?

47:45.320 --> 47:47.948
He's long gone, you big asshole.

47:48.031 --> 47:49.533
And he's probably calling Hopper,

47:49.616 --> 47:52.828
and Hopper's calling the US cavalry.
[laughs]

47:52.911 --> 47:56.206
They're gonna come in here,
commando-style, guns a-blazin',

47:56.290 --> 47:58.125
and kick your sorry asses back to Russia.

47:58.208 --> 47:59.710
You're gonna be two pieces of toast.

47:59.793 --> 48:02.296

48:04.214 --> 48:06.091
Is that so?

48:43.378 --> 48:44.588
Hey! Henderson!

48:44.671 --> 48:46.590
That's crazy,
I was just talking about you.

48:46.673 --> 48:48.634
-Oh, my God!
-Get ready to run.

48:49.551 --> 48:51.303

49:17.663 --> 49:19.748
[man] Hey! Billy, stop!

49:19.831 --> 49:22.501
What the hell is wrong with you?
What did we talk about, huh?

49:22.584 --> 49:23.460
You gotta slide!

49:23.543 --> 49:25.754
-[stammering] I know.
-Wait.

49:25.837 --> 49:28.173
-Afraid you're gonna get hurt, is that it?
-No.

49:28.256 --> 49:30.717
[man] Well, what then? What?

49:30.801 --> 49:33.053
What did I raise, a pussy for a son?

49:33.136 --> 49:35.097
-Leave me alone!
-Hey!

49:35.597 --> 49:37.933

[man] Where were you last night?
Where were you?

49:50.696 --> 49:54.199
-[woman] I told you, I was with Wendy.
-[man] Stop lying to me!

49:54.282 --> 49:56.535
-[woman] I'm not lying to you!
-You saw him again, didn't you?

49:56.952 --> 49:58.829
-Didn't you?!
-Get away from me!

49:59.246 --> 50:01.748
-I said, get away!
-You-- You whore!

50:01.832 --> 50:02.833
-Stop it!
-Bitch!

50:02.916 --> 50:03.959
-Don't hurt her!
-No!

50:07.921 --> 50:09.089
[young Billy] Mom!

50:09.172 --> 50:11.550

50:11.842 --> 50:13.593
Please, Mom, don't do this.

50:13.677 --> 50:14.803
Please come home.

I want you to meet someone.

This is your new sister.
Her name's Maxine.

50:38.452 --> 50:39.286
Max.

50:40.245 --> 50:41.788
-Shake her hand.
-[Billy] Who's there?

50:41.872 --> 50:45.167
