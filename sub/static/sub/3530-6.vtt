00:02.727 --> 00:04.561
<i>Previously, on The Tudors: - The king
of Scotland is not coming. But
worse,</i>

00:04.662 --> 00:07.197
a Scottish army has ridden over the
border and is harrying our people

00:07.265 --> 00:09.566
and killing all those who
oppose them. - Sir Thomas,

00:09.634 --> 00:11.635
you will order our troops
on the border to retaliate

00:11.702 --> 00:14.971
with spoils, burnings and killings.
3 hurts to every one of ours.

00:15.039 --> 00:18.742
Those men that are made by the
king of vile birth have been

00:18.843 --> 00:21.378
the distraction of all the
nobility of this realm.

00:21.479 --> 00:25.449
And if God calls away the King,
they will suffer for it.

00:25.516 --> 00:28.118
I've just heard that the Emperor and
the King of France are on the brink of
war.

00:28.219 --> 00:30.053
I trust you will not forget
to convey to your master

00:30.121 --> 00:32.022
that it would be foolish to contemplate
an invasion of this island.

00:32.122 --> 00:33.924
On the contrary,
he regards England

00:33.991 --> 00:36.560
as his natural ally
against the Emperor.

00:36.661 --> 00:39.096
I mean to show these French

00:39.197 --> 00:41.264
that I will not shy away
from battle if I am provoked.

00:41.332 --> 00:45.535
Until recently, nothing but
war had been talked of.

00:45.603 --> 00:48.672
Something inside me is disappointed.
It hungers for a war.

00:48.739 --> 00:50.941
You know I actually thought the
French might oblige me this time?

00:51.008 --> 00:54.277
The letter accuses Queen
Katherine of dissolute living

00:54.345 --> 00:57.314
before she was married to Your Majesty,
and that her way of life is not a
secret.

00:57.415 --> 00:59.549
Do not desist until you've
reached the bottom of the pot.

00:59.617 --> 01:01.651
My lady, you are confined
to your apartments

01:01.719 --> 01:03.920
for as long as it
please the King.

01:03.988 --> 01:07.124
Why? Why must I stay here?

01:07.225 --> 01:10.927
- Francis Dereham, you are under arrest.
- Under arrest? For what?

01:10.995 --> 01:13.430
I don't believe that you didn't
have carnal knowledge of the Queen.

01:13.498 --> 01:16.733
Someone else has succeeded
me in her affections! - W?

01:16.834 --> 01:19.603
- Thomas Culpepper.
- But it was Katherine

01:19.670 --> 01:23.006
who led me on. She wanted it, not me.
Katherine Howard,

01:23.107 --> 01:25.075
you led the King by word
and gesture to love you,

01:25.143 --> 01:27.244
concealing your contract
with Francis Dereham,

01:27.311 --> 01:29.079
and after marriage,
you showed the same Dereham

01:29.147 --> 01:32.249
notable favour while
inciting Thomas Culpepper

01:32.316 --> 01:35.719
to carnal knowledge, telling him
you love him above the King.

01:35.786 --> 01:38.822
What has happened is your fault.

01:38.890 --> 01:41.725
You solicited me to marry her.
How misfortunate I am

01:41.826 --> 01:44.027
to have so many
ill-conditioned wives.

01:48.866 --> 01:51.635
No! Henry!

Elizabeth!

03:16.321 --> 03:19.022
- Lady Mary.
- Elizabeth!

03:19.090 --> 03:22.659
Are you dressed? - Not quite.
I was reading.

03:22.760 --> 03:24.761
Come and sit. I have some news.

03:29.133 --> 03:33.203
- Mary, what is it?
- I just heard!

03:33.304 --> 03:35.906
By Act of Parliament
you and I are

03:35.974 --> 03:38.275
both restored to the succession.

03:38.343 --> 03:40.844
After Edward and his heirs,
of course.

03:40.945 --> 03:43.647
The King himself must
have commanded this.

03:45.750 --> 03:49.052
Are you not pleased,
Elizabeth? Think what this means.

03:49.153 --> 03:52.656
Yes, Mary. If you are
pleased then so am I.

03:52.757 --> 03:56.894
It means that the
King loves both of us.

03:56.961 --> 03:59.730
And that you may
be Queen some day.

03:59.831 --> 04:03.934
And you. Queen Elizabeth.

04:04.035 --> 04:07.738
Elizabeth?

04:07.839 --> 04:10.741
What's wrong?

04:10.808 --> 04:13.377
Because of what happened-

04:13.444 --> 04:16.980
to Queen Katherine,
I have made my mind up.

04:17.048 --> 04:19.815
In what?

04:22.220 --> 04:24.388
As God is my witness,

04:24.489 --> 04:26.556
I shall never marry!

04:28.526 --> 04:32.029
Never!

04:38.336 --> 04:42.639
Your Majesty, His Excellency
the Imperial Ambassador.

04:45.977 --> 04:48.578
- Excellency.
- Your Majesty.

04:48.680 --> 04:53.383
Your Majesty is most gracious.

04:58.356 --> 05:01.725
I am sure Your Majesty is aware

05:01.793 --> 05:04.394
my master, the Emperor,
is once more

05:04.495 --> 05:06.296
at war with King Francis.

05:08.132 --> 05:10.934
The French King's despicable
alliance with the Turk

05:11.035 --> 05:13.937
threatens not only the borders
of the Emperor's domains,

05:14.005 --> 05:16.940
but also the security
of the whole of Europe.

05:17.041 --> 05:19.876
For that reason alone,

05:19.944 --> 05:22.679
his Imperial Majesty
has asked me

05:22.747 --> 05:26.149
to offer the hand of friendship
to Your Majesty once more,

05:26.217 --> 05:28.952
in joint alliance

05:29.020 --> 05:31.955
against the perfidious French.

05:32.056 --> 05:34.424
What would I gain?

05:34.525 --> 05:37.127
All your lost territories.

05:39.397 --> 05:41.965
The whole of Aquitaine.

05:46.904 --> 05:49.873
Excellency.

06:05.723 --> 06:07.758
Risley!

06:18.002 --> 06:20.670
Excellency.

06:24.742 --> 06:27.511
His Excellency the
French Ambassador.

06:29.814 --> 06:31.581
- Monsieur Marillac.
- Your Majesty.

06:31.682 --> 06:34.017
I hear your country is
at war-with the Emperor.

06:34.085 --> 06:36.119
Indeed.

06:36.220 --> 06:38.588
The Emperor has broken
all his promises

06:38.689 --> 06:40.657
and treaty obligations,

06:40.725 --> 06:44.494
both to my master King
Francis and to you.

06:44.595 --> 06:47.030
Monsieur Marillac,

06:47.098 --> 06:49.232
when you signed a treaty,
your master agreed to pay

06:49.300 --> 06:51.501
an annual pension
to this country,

06:51.602 --> 06:53.236
which he has defaulted on
for the past two years.

06:53.304 --> 06:56.840
As a consequence, he now owes
arrears of a million crowns.

06:56.908 --> 06:58.842
Majesty, if that is true--

06:58.910 --> 07:01.511
You doubt my word,
Monsieur Marillac?

07:01.612 --> 07:03.880
Then-

07:03.981 --> 07:06.416
His Majesty will be informed.

07:06.517 --> 07:08.485
And redress will surely follow.

07:12.924 --> 07:16.960
The alliance between
our countries has kept

07:17.028 --> 07:20.263
the balance of power in
Europe for over ten years.

07:20.331 --> 07:22.532
Surely Your Majesty
would not care

07:22.633 --> 07:24.968
to compromise that
arrangement now,

07:25.069 --> 07:28.138
in the face of
Imperial aggression?

07:37.048 --> 07:40.117
Monsieur Marillac.

07:47.892 --> 07:51.394
I want you to write a letter to the
King of the Scots. Tell him that we
invite him

07:51.462 --> 07:53.396
to sign a treaty
acknowledging our suzerainty

07:53.464 --> 07:56.600
over his country.
Also to tell him to stop

07:56.667 --> 07:59.503
his French and Papal alliances,
or suffer the consequences.

07:59.604 --> 08:02.706
Majesty. - My Lord, I want you
to prepare to go to Scotland

08:02.807 --> 08:04.875
in case my cousin refuses
to concede to our demands.

08:04.942 --> 08:08.044
- Majesty.
- And take Surrey with you.

08:37.909 --> 08:40.809
You play very well, Mr. Leigh.

08:40.878 --> 08:43.947
Always the sign
of a wasted life.

08:44.015 --> 08:48.151
You know, you and I have

08:48.219 --> 08:51.154
more in common

08:51.222 --> 08:53.423
than you might imagine, my Lord.

08:53.491 --> 08:56.960
- What?
- Our families

08:57.028 --> 09:00.363
both come from St.
Mary's parish in Stockwell

09:00.464 --> 09:03.800
and our chapels were
founded in the same year.

09:03.901 --> 09:07.704
That hardly makes us equal,
Mr. Leigh.

09:07.805 --> 09:09.773
There is another thing.

09:09.840 --> 09:13.643
Like you,

09:13.711 --> 09:20.083
my family was related
to the late Queen.

09:25.590 --> 09:28.825
Do not you think it unseemly
to raise her ghost at court?

09:28.893 --> 09:32.362
I think it unseemly

09:32.430 --> 09:34.464
that you Howards
turned a blind eye

09:34.532 --> 09:36.700
to her despicable wantonness,

09:36.767 --> 09:38.702
which tarnished the reputations
of all of us associated

09:38.769 --> 09:41.905
with her! - "You Howards!"

09:46.143 --> 09:48.245
Is that what you just said?

09:52.550 --> 09:55.518
"You Howards"?!

09:58.456 --> 10:00.390
Guards! GUARDS!

10:02.893 --> 10:05.028
I'll cut your tongue out,
so help me God!

10:05.096 --> 10:08.531
I'll cut your
fucking tongue out!

10:08.599 --> 10:11.268
Get off me!

10:18.643 --> 10:21.011
Lord Latimer,

10:21.112 --> 10:23.647
Sir Thomas Seymour.

10:23.714 --> 10:27.017
Oh. Sir Thomas,

10:27.118 --> 10:29.019
how good of you to come.

10:33.090 --> 10:36.293
Please... Please
forgive my infirmities.

10:36.360 --> 10:38.928
As you can see,
I am not a well man.

10:38.996 --> 10:42.299
I trust your Lordship
will soon recover.

10:44.268 --> 10:48.838
I am afraid my health is too
far broken to be mended.

10:48.939 --> 10:52.409
Ah! Allow me to present my wife,

10:52.476 --> 10:56.146
Catherine Parr.
Catherine, Sir Thomas Seymour.

10:56.247 --> 10:58.748
Lady Latimer.

10:58.816 --> 11:02.385
Sir Thomas.

11:02.453 --> 11:04.821
Please. Sit down, Sir Thomas.

11:04.922 --> 11:07.757
Sir Thomas, I do not know

11:07.858 --> 11:10.527
if you are aware of
my personal history?

11:13.097 --> 11:15.565
The Latimers are an
old northern family

11:15.633 --> 11:20.637
and, unfortunately, we were caught up
in the late Rebellion against His
Majesty.

11:24.141 --> 11:27.210
I myself was taken
hostage by Robert Aske

11:27.311 --> 11:31.548
and sore constrained by him.

11:31.615 --> 11:35.185
His Majesty demanded that
I reject Aske which I did,

11:35.252 --> 11:38.121
and came to London
to submit to him.

11:38.189 --> 11:41.658
Still I think the shadow of treason
hangs over me and my family.

11:44.595 --> 11:47.931
I know you have the
ear of the King.

11:47.998 --> 11:50.033
I would like you
to make submission

11:50.134 --> 11:53.770
on my behalf to His Majesty,

11:53.838 --> 12:01.578
of my utter loyalty and...
and...

12:01.679 --> 12:04.414
There, my darling.

12:04.515 --> 12:07.784
Oh. Oh.

12:13.657 --> 12:15.692
Close your eyes and rest now.

12:31.642 --> 12:34.411
Sir Thomas.

12:48.259 --> 12:50.160
Do you think he
suspects anything?

12:50.261 --> 12:53.963
No. Nothing. I'm sure of it.

12:54.064 --> 12:57.167
He cannot be long for
this world, Catherine.

12:57.268 --> 13:00.403
- Hush! Don't say such things.
- I only meant

13:00.504 --> 13:02.472
that I cannot wait until we
can be together,Nd married.

13:02.540 --> 13:07.377
As truly as God is God,

13:07.445 --> 13:11.948
I desire to marry you
above all others.

13:17.421 --> 13:22.292
The Earl of Surrey has written a
letter to Your Majesty's Council.

13:22.359 --> 13:25.595
The Earl is presently
detained at the Fleet Prison.

13:25.663 --> 13:27.697
Prison? What for?

13:27.798 --> 13:29.766
It seems he was in an affray

13:29.834 --> 13:33.770
with one John Leigh within
the verge of the court

13:33.838 --> 13:35.605
and was arrested by
the Sergeant-at-Arms.

13:35.706 --> 13:38.041
What was the cause
of the quarrel?

13:38.108 --> 13:41.744
I believe it touched upon
his Lordship's pride.

13:46.951 --> 13:50.587
- What does he write?
- He demands his immediate release.

13:50.654 --> 13:52.956
- Have you replied?
- We informed his Lordship

13:53.057 --> 13:55.325
that his lack of humility

13:55.426 --> 13:57.327
would only impair his
prospects of liberty.

14:02.299 --> 14:04.133
And why does he say
he should be released?

14:04.235 --> 14:06.035
He infers that the
Earl of Surrey has

14:06.103 --> 14:10.039
no business being so
treated in the first place.

14:10.107 --> 14:12.976
He also speaks

14:13.077 --> 14:16.045
of his readiness to serve
Your Majesty on active duty.

14:21.318 --> 14:23.887
I think he is the most foolish
proud man in all of England.

14:27.057 --> 14:28.892
Set a high surety on his future
behaviour, but release him.

14:28.959 --> 14:30.994
I want him in Scotland.

14:39.537 --> 14:41.638
Go on with your Scottish pride!

14:56.253 --> 14:58.454
My Lord Surrey,
here are three of their nobles

14:58.522 --> 15:02.258
captured in battle: Lord Cassilis,
Lord Glencairn,

15:02.359 --> 15:05.461
and Lord Maxwell. - My Lords,

15:05.529 --> 15:07.997
you will be treated with
the honor and respect

15:08.098 --> 15:11.834
due to your rank and station.

15:11.936 --> 15:13.836
In the name of His Majesty,
King Henry VIII,

15:13.938 --> 15:17.907
I invite you to return with us
to London, where you will be

15:17.975 --> 15:21.110
most comfortably housed.
However, I must ask you

15:21.178 --> 15:23.613
to surrender your swords.

15:23.681 --> 15:26.816
Aye.

15:33.490 --> 15:36.559
Come with those horses
and bring the rope!

15:36.627 --> 15:40.930
My Lords, a great victory was
had by us at Solway Moss.

15:40.998 --> 15:44.067
Thanks to my Lord Hertford
and to my Lord Surrey,

15:44.134 --> 15:46.302
several Scottish
nobles were captured

15:46.403 --> 15:48.838
and are held here
at our pleasure.

15:48.939 --> 15:51.641
But that, my lords,
is not the end to our good news.

15:51.709 --> 15:54.711
Distracted by his
grievous defeat,

15:54.778 --> 15:57.213
the King of the Scots
took to his bed-

15:57.281 --> 15:59.582
and died just two days ago.

15:59.650 --> 16:04.120
And on that day, his wife gave
birth to their only child.

16:04.188 --> 16:06.823
And it was not the son and
heir they had hoped for.

16:06.890 --> 16:09.025
But a girl!

16:09.126 --> 16:11.828
- Yes. - Excellent.
- Your Majesty,

16:11.895 --> 16:15.765
I think we should see it as
an act of divine intervention,

16:15.866 --> 16:19.969
this passing of the Scottish
crown to a very young

16:20.037 --> 16:25.441
female. Thanks be to God.
Thanks be to God, indeed.

16:25.542 --> 16:28.544
Absolutely. - It shall be
a very happy Christmas.

16:28.612 --> 16:30.980
In the absence of a Queen
I have asked the Lady Mary

16:31.048 --> 16:33.650
to preside over the festivities.

16:33.717 --> 16:35.718
Also, my son will be performing
his first public duties.

16:35.819 --> 16:38.187
My Lords.

16:38.288 --> 16:41.424
- Your Majesty.
- Sir.

16:41.492 --> 16:43.793
- Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

16:50.567 --> 16:53.002
Sir Thomas.
I was told you considered

16:53.103 --> 16:56.005
my treatment of the Earl
of Surrey far too lenient.

16:56.106 --> 17:00.176
You said he deserved
a greater punishment.

17:00.244 --> 17:03.479
- Your Majesty, I thought...
- What business do you have to think?

17:03.547 --> 17:06.482
If I were you I would not think-

17:06.583 --> 17:08.651
if thinking makes me come
to the wrong conclusion.

17:08.752 --> 17:13.923
Get out, Tom. - Majesty.

17:23.800 --> 17:26.102
- You look beautiful.
- My Lord.

17:26.203 --> 17:28.137
May I wish you a
very happy Christmas.

17:32.409 --> 17:35.044
- Lady Mary.
- Catherine.

17:38.115 --> 17:40.049
How is Lord Latimer?

17:40.117 --> 17:44.687
No better. He did not feel
strong enough to come to court.

17:44.755 --> 17:46.856
I am so sad for him.

17:46.957 --> 17:50.026
And for you.
I pray for both of you.

17:50.094 --> 17:52.562
I thank you for that.

17:52.629 --> 17:54.764
I will give him
your good wishes,

17:54.832 --> 17:58.134
and Happy Christmas.
Happy Christmas, Catherine.

18:00.437 --> 18:03.673
His Excellency,
the French Ambassador.

18:03.774 --> 18:05.675
Excellence.

18:05.776 --> 18:08.044
Lady Mary!

18:08.112 --> 18:10.513
EnchantÃ©!

18:21.358 --> 18:24.494
Prince Edward and
Lady Elizabeth.

18:24.561 --> 18:28.064
Edward! Edward!
Don't be so impatient.

18:28.165 --> 18:32.235
The Earl and Lady Hertford.

18:34.471 --> 18:37.073
Prince Edward.

18:37.141 --> 18:40.409
My Lords,
may I present His Grace,

18:40.477 --> 18:42.712
Prince Edward. - My Lords.

18:42.813 --> 18:45.948
- Your Grace.
- You are most welcome

18:46.016 --> 18:48.785
to His Majesty's court
at this Christmas time.

18:48.852 --> 18:52.355
Your Grace is very kind
to speak to us in person.

18:52.456 --> 18:54.791
- I have been practicing.
- Well done.

18:54.892 --> 18:59.529
Now come. - Lady Scofield.
Lady Davit.

18:59.630 --> 19:03.432
My Lords, the King has a
proposal to put to you.

19:03.500 --> 19:06.435
There should be a peace
treaty between our countries-

19:06.537 --> 19:09.272
and a formal betrothal
between Prince Edward

19:09.373 --> 19:11.808
and the newly born
Princess Mary of Scots.

19:14.745 --> 19:16.612
The Earl of Devon.

19:16.680 --> 19:20.817
The King is not unaware of
possible... difficulties.

19:20.884 --> 19:24.086
Which is why,
if you support the cause,

19:24.188 --> 19:25.888
you will be rewarded
with a handsome pension

19:25.989 --> 19:29.158
and will be released at
once to return to Scotland.

19:29.259 --> 19:32.628
I am sure your families are missing
you greatly at this time of year.

19:32.729 --> 19:34.997
I know how I should feel,

19:35.098 --> 19:41.103
if I were separated
from my own dear wife.

19:41.205 --> 19:44.707
Your Grace.
Welcome back to court.

19:44.775 --> 19:47.076
Is the Duchess not with you?

19:47.177 --> 19:50.880
No, she's-

19:53.116 --> 19:55.651
the Duchess does as she pleases.

19:55.752 --> 19:57.987
We live mostly separate lives.

19:58.055 --> 20:00.823
I'm very sorry. I- I will
pray for your reconciliation.

20:00.924 --> 20:05.161
The Earl of Wexford.

20:05.229 --> 20:07.363
How is the King?

20:11.501 --> 20:14.470
He has been melancholy as
you might have supposed.

20:14.571 --> 20:18.808
I think he despairs of finding
any happiness in this life.

20:18.876 --> 20:21.744
But in the last few weeks his
mood has altogether changed.

20:21.845 --> 20:24.714
Why, I cannot explain.
Triumph in Scotland, perhaps?

20:24.781 --> 20:26.849
My Lady.

20:26.917 --> 20:29.118
- Your Grace.
- His Majesty the King!

20:29.186 --> 20:32.355
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

20:37.861 --> 20:41.397
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas Your Majesty!

21:30.814 --> 21:32.848
Bravo!

21:43.026 --> 21:45.928
Majesty.

21:54.871 --> 21:56.973
Your Majesty. - What is it?

21:57.074 --> 22:01.077
The Lady Latimer is come to
petition Your Majesty to lift

22:01.178 --> 22:03.145
the suspicion of treason
from her husband,

22:03.213 --> 22:06.082
Lord Latimer. - Where is she?

22:17.160 --> 22:19.996
What does any of this
have to do with you, Tom?

22:20.097 --> 22:24.266
Nothing, Your Majesty.

22:24.334 --> 22:27.536
Except that I'm a
friend of the family.

22:27.604 --> 22:30.172
I believe in Lord Latimer's
complete loyalty to Your Majesty.

22:30.240 --> 22:33.175
I think your mind
works another way

22:33.243 --> 22:36.679
and to another purpose... No,
no. Don't deny it!

22:36.747 --> 22:41.417
Nor can I blame you.
She is still a very handsome woman,

22:41.485 --> 22:45.187
and soon to be a
very rich widow.

22:45.288 --> 22:47.623
Bring her to me.

22:47.691 --> 22:52.261
- Your Majesty.
- Tom.

22:52.362 --> 22:55.064
- Lady Mary.
- My Lord.

22:59.136 --> 23:01.237
My apologies, Your Excellency.

23:01.304 --> 23:03.873
I have recently been away from court
and I am not privy to the King.

23:03.940 --> 23:06.108
Ambassador, excuse me.

23:16.620 --> 23:18.654
You've been a long time
absent from court, Your Grace!

23:18.722 --> 23:21.424
Only to tend to my estates,
Your Majesty.

23:21.491 --> 23:25.661
I rather thought you'd
been careful of me.

23:25.729 --> 23:29.198
You imagine I'm still
angry with you.

23:29.299 --> 23:34.637
You can be too careful,
Your Grace.

23:34.738 --> 23:36.839
It is very remiss of you to neglect
your sovereign for so long.

23:40.043 --> 23:42.745
Yes, Your Majesty.

23:42.813 --> 23:47.450
Anyway, I want you to
do something for me.

23:47.517 --> 23:49.652
Your Grace!

23:49.753 --> 23:52.188
- I need to speak to your master.
- Alas, Your Grace,

23:52.289 --> 23:55.558
my master is in bed with gout
and in the greatest agony.

23:55.659 --> 23:59.228
No, no. Show His Grace in.
By all means.

24:06.269 --> 24:08.504
Your Grace must forgive me.

24:08.572 --> 24:10.973
Of course.

24:11.074 --> 24:12.942
I have brought
something for you.

24:13.009 --> 24:15.811
May I ask its import?

24:15.912 --> 24:19.081
It contains the outlines for a
secret treaty between our masters.

24:19.149 --> 24:21.784
The recent seizures of
English merchant ships

24:21.852 --> 24:24.053
in the French ports

24:24.154 --> 24:26.989
and the French King's
new amity with the Turks

24:27.057 --> 24:29.325
are the final straw.

24:29.392 --> 24:33.162
King Henry promises
to support the Emperor

24:33.230 --> 24:35.164
whenever he is
called upon to do so.

24:35.232 --> 24:37.600
He also pledges to invade France

24:37.667 --> 24:40.803
in conjunction with
the Emperor's armies.

24:53.650 --> 24:57.419
Your Grace could not have made me
happier if you had brought me a cure
for gout!

24:57.487 --> 25:00.356
I will make sure

25:00.457 --> 25:02.525
this is delivered to
the Emperor immediately

25:02.592 --> 25:04.727
and you can be sure
that he will receive it

25:04.794 --> 25:06.829
with the very greatest pleasure.

25:16.640 --> 25:19.975
Your Majesty,
Lady Latimer is here.

25:23.647 --> 25:27.716
- Your Majesty.
- Lady Latimer.

25:36.826 --> 25:40.362
Lady Latimer,
I wanted to assure you

25:40.430 --> 25:43.732
there is no suspicion of
treason against your husband,

25:43.833 --> 25:46.835
still less against
you and your family.

25:46.903 --> 25:49.371
Thank you, Your Majesty.

25:49.472 --> 25:53.742
I know very well the cause of
the distress to Lord Latimer

25:53.843 --> 25:55.811
during the late
rebellion in the North.

25:55.879 --> 26:00.282
I also know that you and
your stepchildren were

26:00.350 --> 26:05.020
very roughly handled by
the traitor Robert Aske.

26:05.121 --> 26:07.289
You must have been very
frightened, my Lady.

26:07.357 --> 26:09.391
Well, at the time, sir,

26:09.492 --> 26:11.927
I was more frightened
for my husband,

26:11.995 --> 26:15.397
for his safety and his sanity.

26:18.134 --> 26:21.303
I hear that Lord
Latimer is unwell.

26:21.371 --> 26:24.139
He is very ill indeed,
Your Majesty

26:24.241 --> 26:27.109
and not likely to live long.

26:27.177 --> 26:32.648
- You have no children by him?
- No, Your Majesty.

26:32.716 --> 26:34.950
Nor by your first husband?

26:35.051 --> 26:39.054
Ah. No.

26:39.122 --> 26:41.957
I was married at seventeen
to Edward Borough,

26:42.025 --> 26:44.193
the son of Lord Borough.

26:44.261 --> 26:46.762
But he died three years later.

26:46.863 --> 26:51.233
I was told he was insane.
Is it true?

26:54.404 --> 26:56.772
It was not a happy marriage,
Your Majesty.

26:58.842 --> 27:02.611
Do you think such
a thing exists?

27:02.712 --> 27:05.147
Oh, yes!

27:05.248 --> 27:09.151
I believe so with all
my heart and soul.

27:09.219 --> 27:13.255
Oh!

27:13.356 --> 27:16.959
Ah... please forgive me.

27:17.027 --> 27:19.495
No, no, no, no, no.

27:19.562 --> 27:21.797
You are to be congratulated,
Lady Latimer,

27:21.865 --> 27:27.169
for your-eternal optimism.

27:36.913 --> 27:38.781
Your Grace,

27:38.882 --> 27:42.084
His Majesty has sent these
papers for your attention.

27:42.152 --> 27:44.520
Thank you, Mr. Risley.

27:44.621 --> 27:47.222
Ah, Mr. Risley,

27:47.290 --> 27:49.158
you know I'm sure

27:49.225 --> 27:52.127
that the King has made a
secret treaty with the Emperor,

27:52.195 --> 27:54.630
the great champion
of Catholicism!

27:54.731 --> 27:57.366
Well, as a result, I see no
reason why we should not start

27:57.467 --> 27:59.601
hunting down all the Lutherans

27:59.669 --> 28:01.870
and Evangelicals in
His Majesty's Kingdom.

28:01.938 --> 28:04.406
Do you think there
are many such?

28:04.474 --> 28:06.241
I know it!

28:06.309 --> 28:08.777
They breed like rats.

28:08.845 --> 28:11.914
They spread the vile disease
of their heresy everywhere!

28:11.981 --> 28:15.150
Some of them, even now,

28:15.218 --> 28:18.921
are very close to the King.

28:22.492 --> 28:25.361
And-we should flush them out?

28:25.428 --> 28:27.696
Exactly.

28:27.764 --> 28:30.065
And set them on the
pyres at Smithfield.

28:30.133 --> 28:34.169
Don't you agree, Mr. Risley?

28:52.088 --> 28:54.022
Parcels, sweetheart?

28:54.090 --> 28:58.093
Who from? - From the King.

28:58.194 --> 29:00.362
The King?

29:00.430 --> 29:02.898
Parcels from the King?

29:02.966 --> 29:05.467
Well. Are you not
going to open them?

29:05.568 --> 29:07.469
Yes...

29:07.570 --> 29:09.638
Open them then.

29:13.610 --> 29:16.378
What are they?

29:16.479 --> 29:19.114
Pleats... and sleeves.

29:19.182 --> 29:21.850
For dresses.

29:21.918 --> 29:24.920
Let me look.

29:31.294 --> 29:35.497
Are they fashionable? - Yes.

29:35.598 --> 29:38.133
Why should the King
send you presents?

29:41.404 --> 29:43.272
I don't know. I think
that I should return them.

29:43.339 --> 29:48.010
You cannot return
presents to the King.

29:48.077 --> 29:51.647
You must acknowledge them.

29:51.714 --> 29:53.649
I don't know why
he has sent them.

29:53.716 --> 29:57.486
Yes you do, my love.

29:57.554 --> 30:01.690
Yes you do.

30:07.630 --> 30:09.765
I feel as though I
am dead already.

30:14.604 --> 30:17.973
I call upon His
Gracious Majesty,

30:18.041 --> 30:20.409
King Henry VIII,

30:20.510 --> 30:22.411
to pledge before God

30:22.512 --> 30:24.947
and these witnesses to honor

30:25.014 --> 30:27.416
this new Treaty
between His Majesty

30:27.517 --> 30:31.653
and King Charles V,
the Holy Roman Emperor.

30:34.390 --> 30:36.158
This treaty of mutual
assurance contains

30:36.226 --> 30:39.127
within it an obligation

30:39.195 --> 30:42.331
to undertake a war
against France

30:42.432 --> 30:44.800
within two years of this date,

30:44.868 --> 30:50.138
to which His Majesty agrees
to send 40,000 men-at-arms

30:50.240 --> 30:53.876
for that purpose.

30:53.943 --> 30:55.978
Your Majesty,

30:56.079 --> 30:57.980
do you pledge to honor

30:58.081 --> 31:00.716
all the terms of
this new treaty?

31:00.783 --> 31:03.252
I do, so help me God.

31:03.319 --> 31:07.789
- Will you sign the Treaty?
- I will.

31:46.195 --> 31:50.165
Finally. Your men
shall see France.

31:57.340 --> 31:58.540
So Excellency,

31:58.608 --> 32:00.175
is it true that a new
treaty has been signed

32:00.243 --> 32:02.110
between His Majesty
and the Emperor!?

32:02.211 --> 32:04.880
I don't understand.

32:04.948 --> 32:08.383
What, but the design of
subjugating Christendom,

32:08.451 --> 32:12.387
could make a revengeful prince
like the Emperor forget the insult

32:12.455 --> 32:15.557
done to him by the King of England,
in the person of his aunt?

32:15.625 --> 32:17.926
Those insults are long forgotten,
Monsieur Marillac.

32:18.027 --> 32:20.095
You don't deny

32:20.196 --> 32:22.097
then, that your master plan is

32:22.198 --> 32:23.999
to subjugate the
whole of Christendom?

32:24.100 --> 32:26.301
I do deny it.

32:26.369 --> 32:28.470
I believe those ambitions
are held by the Turks,

32:28.538 --> 32:32.841
with whom your own
master is in alliance!

32:32.909 --> 32:36.178
- Excellency! - Your Grace.
- May I present you

32:36.245 --> 32:39.081
with a formal intimation of
war against your country.

32:54.063 --> 32:56.365
Lady Latimer is here,
Sir Thomas.

33:05.541 --> 33:07.609
My God, look at you!

33:07.677 --> 33:11.380
You look so very beautiful.

33:11.481 --> 33:14.383
Catherine? What is it?

33:16.386 --> 33:18.720
This dress was a gift.

33:18.788 --> 33:23.025
A gift? From whom?

33:23.092 --> 33:25.360
From the King.

33:27.296 --> 33:29.531
When did the King start

33:29.599 --> 33:31.433
sending you presents?

33:31.501 --> 33:34.269
Recently. I-I gave him no cause!

33:34.337 --> 33:38.640
No. Of course not.
How could you?

33:38.741 --> 33:41.443
Well, you do believe me,
don't you?

33:41.511 --> 33:43.845
Please say that you believe me.

33:43.946 --> 33:46.281
Thomas, I love you.

33:46.382 --> 33:49.284
I never sought these
advances from the King,

33:49.385 --> 33:51.353
do not welcome them.

33:51.421 --> 33:54.356
You would not-

33:54.424 --> 33:56.458
like to be Queen of England?

33:56.526 --> 33:59.127
No! For heavens' sake!

33:59.228 --> 34:00.996
You know what happens
to his Queens!

34:01.064 --> 34:04.032
Everyone knows what happens.

34:04.133 --> 34:08.469
Thomas, I-I'm afraid.

34:08.538 --> 34:11.672
Well, don't be.

34:11.774 --> 34:16.110
He's just a lonely man that
has set his cap at you.

34:16.179 --> 34:19.281
. I hope so.

34:23.719 --> 34:26.121
Your Majesty should know that
the Regent Queen of Scotland

34:26.188 --> 34:28.556
has given permission for
negotiations to begin

34:28.623 --> 34:30.692
regarding a marriage contract

34:30.793 --> 34:34.029
between her daughter Mary,
soon to be Queen of Scots,

34:34.130 --> 34:37.599
and your son, Prince Edward.

34:37.699 --> 34:40.034
After the negotiations
are complete a treaty

34:40.103 --> 34:43.405
will be signed, uniting through
marriage the English and Scottish
thrones-

34:43.505 --> 34:46.141
as Your Majesty so desires.

34:46.208 --> 34:50.212
It seems our Noble Scottish
lords did as we bid them.

34:50.279 --> 34:52.781
Majesty, with an infant Queen,
a quarrelsome nobility,

34:52.849 --> 34:55.751
and a lack of French support,
what choice do the Scots have?

34:55.818 --> 34:57.953
I agree.

34:58.054 --> 35:00.222
I only ask you to
expedite negotiations

35:00.289 --> 35:02.157
and not let this
opportunity pass.

35:02.258 --> 35:04.326
I don't always trust the Scots.

35:06.095 --> 35:10.599
Your Grace-you tabled an item?
Your Majesty,

35:10.666 --> 35:13.235
I regret to have to inform you

35:13.302 --> 35:17.038
that we have discovered
a nest of heretics

35:17.106 --> 35:19.875
at the very heart of
Your Majesty's household.

35:21.811 --> 35:24.246
Of whom do you speak?

35:24.313 --> 35:27.582
The musicians of
the Royal Chapel.

35:29.552 --> 35:31.486
All of them?

35:31.554 --> 35:35.357
The Master of Choristers,
John Marbeck,

35:35.424 --> 35:38.160
stands accused of being
a secret Calvinist.

35:38.227 --> 35:40.629
Also, the Organist,

35:40.696 --> 35:43.698
Robert Testwood
and Edmund Harman,

35:43.766 --> 35:46.234
a singing man.

35:46.302 --> 35:49.070
Do we have Your
Majesty's permission

35:49.138 --> 35:52.808
to arrest and examine these men?

36:00.183 --> 36:02.083
Your Grace, I give you license.

36:02.185 --> 36:06.254
I will have no Evangelicals
or traitors in this household.

36:06.355 --> 36:09.191
And for those who wish to
alter or push my Reformation

36:09.258 --> 36:11.626
to the extremes, I say this:

36:11.727 --> 36:14.462
there will be no alteration
to the Church of England

36:14.564 --> 36:17.165
as long as I live!

36:30.513 --> 36:33.381
John Marbeck. Robert Testwood!

36:33.449 --> 36:35.150
Edmund Harman! You are all

36:35.218 --> 36:37.285
under arrest.

36:37.386 --> 36:40.288
Seize him!

36:40.389 --> 36:43.191
You should not have come here,
Mr. Testwood.

36:43.259 --> 36:47.362
My Lord-where else could I go?
Please help me.

36:47.430 --> 36:50.165
I beg of you.
There is nothing I can do,

36:50.233 --> 36:53.802
without condemning myself,
and that I will not do.

36:53.870 --> 36:56.104
You are only to be
examined by Gardiner.

36:56.172 --> 36:58.106
If you answer him as he
desires to be answered,

36:58.174 --> 37:00.442
then what have you to fear?
I fear, my Lady,

37:00.509 --> 37:03.578
that His Grace will then resort

37:03.679 --> 37:06.748
to other means of persuasion,
since that is the way now.

37:08.985 --> 37:11.853
Then you must be strong in
your faith, Mr. Testwood.

37:11.921 --> 37:15.023
We all know the day may
come when we have to walk

37:15.091 --> 37:19.828
in the path of Christ.
But if we are afraid, if we turn away,

37:19.929 --> 37:24.566
then we have no right to call
ourselves true Christians.

37:29.405 --> 37:32.674
If you so much as mention
my husband's name,

37:32.742 --> 37:37.579
I assure you that things will
go very badly with your family.

37:37.680 --> 37:40.548
Your sweet wife

37:40.616 --> 37:44.386
and those two lovely children.

37:55.331 --> 37:58.600
People tell me that you
have been unwell, Lady Mary.

37:58.701 --> 38:01.503
I trust not too unwell.

38:01.604 --> 38:03.471
I thank you.

38:03.539 --> 38:07.142
The surgeons have bled me once or twice,
and so I think to be better.

38:07.243 --> 38:09.144
- God willing.
- Yes, God willing.

38:09.211 --> 38:11.379
My Lady.

38:11.447 --> 38:13.581
Tell me what is
happening in court.

38:13.683 --> 38:16.217
Is the King thinking
of marrying again?

38:16.285 --> 38:19.220
There is a new law enacted.

38:19.322 --> 38:23.291
It requires that any lady
the King may marry must,

38:23.359 --> 38:25.927
on pain of death,
disclose any charge

38:25.995 --> 38:28.496
of sexual misconduct
that might be

38:28.597 --> 38:31.800
brought against her.
Frankly, my Lady,

38:31.901 --> 38:34.302
this rather narrows the field.

38:34.370 --> 38:37.772
The ladies at court
are-how to say-

38:37.840 --> 38:40.775
not exactly known
for their virtue.

38:40.876 --> 38:45.613
I still think the King
will want to remarry.

38:45.681 --> 38:47.716
It is true he has a son,

38:47.783 --> 38:49.718
but he will need another
son to feel secure,

38:49.785 --> 38:53.254
in case the first should die.
You are right.

38:53.356 --> 38:56.124
And yet-what woman on earth
would want to marry a King

38:56.192 --> 38:59.995
who either puts his wives
away-or kills them?

39:04.667 --> 39:06.534
Master Testwood.

39:06.635 --> 39:09.337
Enough heretical
material was discovered

39:09.405 --> 39:11.272
in your house to
have you condemned

39:11.340 --> 39:14.509
as a secret Calvinist.

39:14.577 --> 39:18.446
However, I would fain save you,

39:18.547 --> 39:21.449
but you must help me first.

39:21.517 --> 39:23.885
Just think.

39:23.986 --> 39:26.721
The pain you suffer now will be

39:26.822 --> 39:30.258
as nothing compared to
the pains of the fire.

39:30.326 --> 39:33.528
And all because you falsely,

39:33.629 --> 39:36.097
mistakenly, treacherously

39:36.198 --> 39:39.801
shelter those above you. If you
will just confess to me their names.

39:39.902 --> 39:42.971
Move it on!

39:43.039 --> 39:47.275
There is an Usher of the King's,
Sir Philip Holby.

39:47.343 --> 39:49.711
Is he one of your
heretic circle?

39:49.779 --> 39:51.713
- No.
- Dr. Simon Heynes,

39:51.781 --> 39:56.451
the Dean of Exeter?
You sang for him once, I think?

39:56.519 --> 39:59.988
Is he another of
your secret heretics?

40:00.089 --> 40:05.460
And what of the
Earl of Hertford?

40:05.561 --> 40:09.297
You give me the
Earl of Hertford,

40:09.398 --> 40:13.902
and I will give you
back your life.

40:13.969 --> 40:16.004
An excellent plan, Your Majesty.

40:16.072 --> 40:18.206
- My Lord. - My lady.
- Of all the hook stories,

40:18.307 --> 40:22.644
this is my favourite.
Do you agree? - Indeed.

40:22.745 --> 40:27.182
How is your husband,
Lady Latimer?

40:27.249 --> 40:29.818
I'm afraid he has taken to his bed,
Your Majesty,

40:29.885 --> 40:32.754
and lately made his will.

40:32.822 --> 40:35.623
I am very sorry to hear that.

40:39.095 --> 40:43.198
I must thank Your Majesty
for this beautiful dress,

40:43.265 --> 40:45.366
and your other generous gifts,

40:45.434 --> 40:47.302
of which I have done
nothing to deserve.

40:47.369 --> 40:50.271
You looked very sad, my Lady.

40:52.341 --> 40:54.542
I am sure your recent life has
been very difficult for you.

40:56.479 --> 40:59.214
I wanted to give you something
to give you good cheer.

40:59.281 --> 41:01.216
I wanted to see you smile.

41:01.283 --> 41:03.585
There.

41:05.588 --> 41:07.689
We will soon be at
war with France.

41:07.790 --> 41:09.858
How is it, my Lord Suffolk?

41:09.925 --> 41:12.760
It cannot come soon enough for me,
Your Majesty. - I agree.

41:12.862 --> 41:15.396
When it comes, the war will
be a chance for us to exceed

41:15.464 --> 41:17.232
even the glories of Henry V

41:17.299 --> 41:20.235
at Agincourt.
And you, my Lord Surrey?

41:20.336 --> 41:22.403
Majesty, my kind always

41:22.471 --> 41:25.240
desires the honor of the field.

41:25.341 --> 41:28.009
And what better
field than France?

41:28.077 --> 41:30.011
Aye.

41:33.249 --> 41:35.450
Do you play cards, Lady Latimer?

41:35.518 --> 41:38.753
Yes, Your Majesty. I do.

41:38.854 --> 41:41.189
Good.

41:43.259 --> 41:46.394
The King seems quite
taken with Lady Latimer.

41:46.462 --> 41:48.630
It's true.

41:48.697 --> 41:51.900
And we know that when he takes
a fancy to a person or a thing,

41:51.967 --> 41:53.835
he usually goes the whole way.

41:53.936 --> 41:57.472
Perhaps that is
why he's so happy.

42:02.845 --> 42:05.580
My Lord,

42:05.681 --> 42:09.284
have you heard what happened to
those musicians who were arrested?

42:09.351 --> 42:11.853
Gardiner examined them.

42:11.954 --> 42:13.755
He was not satisfied
with their answers

42:13.822 --> 42:17.091
and all three have been
transferred to the Tower.

42:17.159 --> 42:20.295
May I ask why Your
Grace is curious?

42:20.362 --> 42:22.897
Yes. You may ask.

42:25.734 --> 42:28.603
- Oh!
- Excuse me, brother.

42:39.982 --> 42:43.051
Oh!

42:43.152 --> 42:44.852
Your hand, my Lady.

42:44.954 --> 42:47.589
Your prize.

42:49.658 --> 42:51.593
No, Your Majesty.

42:51.694 --> 42:54.862
- Please.
- Your Majesty, I couldn't.

42:54.930 --> 42:57.065
Look inside.

43:14.683 --> 43:17.518
Your Majesty,

43:17.620 --> 43:20.355
although I am so touched,

43:20.456 --> 43:23.424
and flattered,

43:23.492 --> 43:25.326
I cannot accept this ring.

43:25.394 --> 43:28.796
Please, accept this for me.

43:50.519 --> 43:52.520
Thank you.

43:52.588 --> 43:54.555
You're welcome.

43:58.727 --> 44:00.795
Sir Thomas!

44:05.634 --> 44:09.370
I have some very good
news for you. - Majesty?

44:09.438 --> 44:11.339
I'm sending you to Brussels,

44:11.407 --> 44:13.908
on permanent embassy to the court
of the Regent of the Netherlands.

44:13.976 --> 44:17.178
Does it please you, Sir Thomas?

44:17.246 --> 44:20.248
I'm...

44:20.316 --> 44:22.383
I'm very grateful
to Your Majesty.

44:22.484 --> 44:24.385
Good.

44:47.810 --> 44:50.378
Is Your Majesty considering

44:50.479 --> 44:52.747
another marriage?

44:52.848 --> 44:54.816
Perhaps.

44:54.883 --> 44:58.086
- And a war in France?
- For certain.

45:02.424 --> 45:04.258
Do you really want
to fight again?

45:04.326 --> 45:07.662
Yes. Don't you?

45:07.730 --> 45:10.298
I thought you did.

45:10.399 --> 45:12.300
And... take another wife?

45:12.401 --> 45:15.403
Yes.

45:15.504 --> 45:17.772
Am I not still able?

45:17.873 --> 45:20.475
To have a wife?
To have more children?

45:20.542 --> 45:25.213
To be myself?

45:31.387 --> 45:34.222
<i>Requiem aeternum dona
es Domine,</i>

45:34.323 --> 45:37.959
<i>et Lux perpetua Au luceat.</i>

45:43.298 --> 45:45.400
John.

45:48.670 --> 45:51.472
John, I need to say
something to you.

45:51.540 --> 45:55.209
John.

46:02.184 --> 46:05.119
Go to hell...

46:12.795 --> 46:16.831
<i>In nomine Patris et Filii et
Spiritus Sancti. Amen.</i>

47:04.413 --> 47:07.315
Catherine Parr, we are sent here

47:07.416 --> 47:09.150
by the King's Majesty
to offer you,

47:09.251 --> 47:12.019
after your days of mourning

47:12.087 --> 47:14.856
for your late husband
are complete,

47:14.957 --> 47:18.593
his Majesty's hand in marriage.

47:18.694 --> 47:20.661
His Majesty esteems you
above all other women

47:20.729 --> 47:23.865
in his kingdom and hopes
to find you well disposed

47:23.932 --> 47:26.701
towards his offer, in which case

47:26.768 --> 47:29.871
he will be the happiest
man now alive in England,

47:29.938 --> 47:32.974
and you the happiest woman.
