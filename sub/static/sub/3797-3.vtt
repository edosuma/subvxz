01:47.791 --> 01:50.332
( glass shatters )

03:04.000 --> 03:06.957
Ain't no use
in that stuff.

03:09.041 --> 03:10.875
You said a safe.

03:10.875 --> 03:13.041
Mm-hmm.

03:13.041 --> 03:15.000
So where it at?

03:15.708 --> 03:18.291
Somewhere.

03:18.291 --> 03:20.833
This the right
house or not?

03:26.166 --> 03:28.749
( sniffs )

03:28.750 --> 03:31.250
Yeah, these look real,
but they ain't.

03:34.708 --> 03:36.291
Gooseberried
some clothes.

03:36.291 --> 03:38.416
Ate our fill.
Now let's go.

03:39.458 --> 03:42.000
Buck, this ain't
no place to be now.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.625
Good morning now.

03:47.500 --> 03:49.208
Know who we are?

03:51.416 --> 03:52.750
The moving men.

03:52.750 --> 03:54.750
- We're not moving anywhere.
- We is, though.

03:54.750 --> 03:58.625
Cash, whatever.

03:58.625 --> 03:59.916
We gone, easy.

03:59.916 --> 04:02.708
We don't have any cash.

04:02.708 --> 04:04.375
Which is we?

04:04.375 --> 04:06.291
What?

04:06.291 --> 04:07.833
You said "we."

04:09.125 --> 04:11.208
I meant me.

04:11.208 --> 04:13.000
I don't have
any cash.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.375
Alone here?

04:17.916 --> 04:20.375
Went to church regular.

04:20.375 --> 04:21.916
What they taught me...

04:23.166 --> 04:26.250
is that you
can fool people...

04:27.791 --> 04:31.750
but the good Lord
always know when you lying.

04:36.958 --> 04:38.625
Check upstairs.

04:40.208 --> 04:41.166
Go on.

05:02.791 --> 05:04.458
- ( piano playing )
- Boy.

05:12.083 --> 05:14.750
- Man: Boy.
- Man #2: Boy.

05:26.333 --> 05:27.583
Woman:
 Boy.

05:35.500 --> 05:37.916
- Hello, Albert.
- Hello, Winnie.

05:39.166 --> 05:41.041
Lovely to see you.

05:46.625 --> 05:47.208
( whispers )
Boy.

05:55.791 --> 05:57.291
What would you
do for love?

05:57.291 --> 05:59.250
Sir?

05:59.250 --> 06:01.791
Would you hazard
everything you held dear?

06:01.791 --> 06:04.333
Family, friends, respect,

06:04.333 --> 06:08.500
judgment in the eyes
of an all-seeing God,

06:08.500 --> 06:10.958
and call it a price
worth paying?

06:10.958 --> 06:13.375
I would.
I definitely would.

06:15.208 --> 06:18.958
That's how we are,
men like us.

06:18.958 --> 06:21.416
All or nothing.

06:23.041 --> 06:24.833
Fresh ones every day.

06:26.625 --> 06:28.375
I'm counting on you.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.625
( piano continues )

06:51.083 --> 06:53.625
What do we need
the roscoes for?

06:53.625 --> 06:55.291
Because I want you
to get them.

06:55.291 --> 06:56.291
( phone ringing )

06:56.291 --> 06:59.000
I'm trying to run
a business here.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.125
It's my business
you're running.

07:01.125 --> 07:02.291
Sean:
 Nuck.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.458
Fetch them
from the warehouse.

07:07.458 --> 07:09.375
Make sure
they can handle guns.

07:09.375 --> 07:11.250
You said Maranzano
told you God bless.

07:12.625 --> 07:15.375
They told the Indians
they could keep Oklahoma.

07:16.833 --> 07:18.125
How'd they get
wrapped up in this?

07:18.875 --> 07:22.083
Sean: Nuck.

07:22.083 --> 07:23.916
Bring the muscle.

07:23.916 --> 07:28.000
Man:
 Hey, stop staring at her ass
 and get to work.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.583
Mickey:
 Who's gonna load
 the trucks?

07:29.583 --> 07:32.041
There's eight million men
looking for work.

07:32.041 --> 07:34.500
Those bums
down by the rail yard?

07:34.500 --> 07:35.958
Hey, Nucky.

07:35.958 --> 07:38.166
I don't like that
element hanging around.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.083
- You could be
one of them.
- Nuck.

07:40.083 --> 07:42.291
Okay, one thing.

07:42.291 --> 07:43.958
I don't take my mood
out on you.

07:43.958 --> 07:45.125
- What?
- Cuba and mail.

07:54.750 --> 07:55.750
Hello?

07:55.750 --> 07:57.125
Woman:
 Long distance operator.

07:57.125 --> 07:59.750
Your call to Havana, Cuba,
is now connected.

07:59.750 --> 08:02.333
I could have
traveled there myself
for all the time it took.

08:02.333 --> 08:05.166
- ( laughs )
- Woman: Go ahead, please.

08:05.166 --> 08:08.250
- Nucky: Hello?
- Well, I thought
it was funny.

08:08.250 --> 08:10.333
How's our man at Bacardi?

08:10.333 --> 08:12.583
And quite
the conversationalist, too.

08:12.583 --> 08:13.666
I'm sorry.

08:13.666 --> 08:16.291
How are you?

08:16.291 --> 08:18.250
I'm fine.

08:18.250 --> 08:20.750
And so is Ronis,
though he keeps making
these squawking noises

08:20.750 --> 08:21.916
about his expenses.

08:21.916 --> 08:23.333
Well, I'll be back there
soon enough,

08:23.333 --> 08:24.291
so he can shake me
down in person.

08:24.291 --> 08:27.166
Well, that's
much more polite.

08:27.166 --> 08:29.750
And Senator Lloyd,
how's he?

08:29.750 --> 08:31.625
Gone.
Flown the coop.

08:31.625 --> 08:33.207
Hightailed it back
to Washington.

08:33.207 --> 08:35.291
Well, which one is it?

08:35.291 --> 08:37.582
We've lost him either way.

08:37.582 --> 08:40.250
So what do we do now?

08:40.250 --> 08:41.457
I've got a big fish
coming down from Boston

08:41.457 --> 08:43.291
looking to get into
the liquor business.

08:43.291 --> 08:46.333
What rock did you
find him under?

08:46.333 --> 08:48.416
He's a Wall Street man,

08:48.416 --> 08:49.958
among his other interests.

08:49.958 --> 08:53.416
Well, I'm glad
that my investment
is well protected.

08:53.416 --> 08:54.875
( chuckles )

08:54.875 --> 08:57.625
What's so funny?

08:57.625 --> 09:02.083

09:48.750 --> 09:50.625
Are you familiar with
the name Abe Redstone?

09:50.625 --> 09:53.375
Only vaguely.

09:53.375 --> 09:56.416
He was a client
of Mr. Bennett's.

09:56.416 --> 09:58.916
He liked milk
as I recall.

09:58.916 --> 10:01.000
Was a client?

10:02.333 --> 10:03.833
I haven't seen him
in quite some time.

10:03.833 --> 10:06.875
Are you aware that
the name Redstone
was an alias?

10:06.875 --> 10:11.000
No, sir, I was not.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.458
Aware.

10:12.458 --> 10:14.875
Arnold Rothstein.
Do you know who that is?

10:15.833 --> 10:18.791
I take it you read
the tabloids?

10:18.791 --> 10:21.333
The advice columns, mostly.

10:23.083 --> 10:26.333
Mr. Rothstein was a rather
notorious figure.

10:26.333 --> 10:28.375
Well known
to law enforcement.

10:28.375 --> 10:29.875
A gambler and a bootlegger

10:29.875 --> 10:30.625
with ties
to the narcotics trade.

10:30.625 --> 10:34.791
Oh, my.

10:34.791 --> 10:37.500
Abe Redstone was one
of his many aliases.

10:37.500 --> 10:41.000
Well, as I said,
it's been years.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
Rothstein died in 1928.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.791
Murdered by persons unknown.

10:45.791 --> 10:48.375
And yet his account,
or Mr. Redstone's account,

10:48.375 --> 10:49.500
has been very much alive.

10:49.500 --> 10:52.750
18 cash withdrawals
since then,

10:52.750 --> 10:55.583
totaling $111,000.

10:55.583 --> 10:58.041
There was no mention
of this account in his
probate proceedings.

10:58.041 --> 11:01.333
It seems that
your Mr. Bennett had been
siphoning the funds

11:01.333 --> 11:03.458
and using the money
to play the market himself.

11:03.458 --> 11:05.208
Conors:
 And losing.

11:05.208 --> 11:06.958
Oh, my goodness.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.541
Mrs. Rothstein is conferring
with her attorney.

11:08.541 --> 11:13.083
Legal action against
the firm is imminent.

11:14.250 --> 11:16.833
Someone needs
to answer for this.

11:16.833 --> 11:19.750
You said
it was Mr. Bennett.

11:22.083 --> 11:25.375
Are these not
your signatures,
Miss Rohan?

11:25.375 --> 11:26.541
I signed a great
many pieces--

11:26.541 --> 11:29.833
These are the ones
we're interested in.

11:35.833 --> 11:37.708
We don't have much,
but take whatever you need.

11:37.708 --> 11:40.291
Take it and go.

11:56.458 --> 11:57.666
$9 in the purse?

11:57.666 --> 12:00.541
That's my pay.

12:00.541 --> 12:03.208
Part-time at Kresge's.
That's what they pay me.

12:03.208 --> 12:04.708
Where your man at?

12:06.041 --> 12:08.041
My husband?

12:08.041 --> 12:10.041
You on your lonesome.
Where he?

12:14.208 --> 12:17.333
Father works
for Mr. Zimmer.

12:17.333 --> 12:19.791
He's running a farm auction
over to Chambersburg.

12:19.791 --> 12:21.125
He's coming back soon.

12:24.250 --> 12:25.916
What's your name?

12:27.833 --> 12:30.833
- Fern.
- What you do, Fern?

12:30.833 --> 12:32.833
Go to school.

12:32.833 --> 12:34.541
- Say what?
- She go to school.

12:34.541 --> 12:36.791
Talk for herself,
can't she?

12:36.791 --> 12:38.541
I heard her fine.

12:41.500 --> 12:44.125
My ears is ringing.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.833
Why you think that is?

12:50.458 --> 12:51.208
Maybe you're not well.

12:53.875 --> 12:57.750
We have headache powder.
I'll get you some.

12:57.750 --> 12:59.250
You all threw
a big old party in here.

13:02.500 --> 13:04.708
- I'm sorry, I--
- House all lit up.

13:04.708 --> 13:06.166
Silver trays on the table.

13:06.166 --> 13:10.166
Food piled up.
Never seen the like.

13:11.750 --> 13:13.208
We don't have parties.

13:13.208 --> 13:14.916
We don't have the money.

13:14.916 --> 13:18.583
I brung in the ice.
Yes, ma'am.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.833
She only this high.

13:21.833 --> 13:24.625
Ribbon in her hair.

13:24.625 --> 13:27.500
And the man

13:27.500 --> 13:30.291
watched me haul
that block,

13:30.291 --> 13:31.666
put it in the cellar.

13:31.666 --> 13:33.875
100 pound.

13:33.875 --> 13:37.208
And all he give me...

13:38.958 --> 13:41.291
was a "That'll do."

13:41.291 --> 13:43.541
It wasn't us.

13:46.208 --> 13:50.583
Then how come
we sitting here?

13:50.583 --> 13:52.250
Take the money.
Please.

13:54.583 --> 13:57.333
- We won't say anything.
- Lies before the Lord!

14:02.625 --> 14:05.416
He know.

14:07.041 --> 14:09.708
And He just
won't abide it.

14:14.375 --> 14:16.125
That's the awful thing
about Him.

14:22.958 --> 14:25.625
What grade you in?

14:26.833 --> 14:28.000
What?

14:28.000 --> 14:30.375
You go to school.

14:30.375 --> 14:32.291
What grade you in?

14:34.333 --> 14:35.625
10th.

14:37.208 --> 14:39.875
They send
truant officer around.

14:39.875 --> 14:40.625
Won't they do that?

14:40.625 --> 14:43.291
Yes.

14:43.291 --> 14:45.708
- They're very vigilant.
- They what?

14:47.125 --> 14:48.875
They pay close attention.

14:50.958 --> 14:52.875
How you know about
gals in school?

14:52.875 --> 14:54.541
- Everybody know.
- How you know?

14:54.541 --> 14:57.708
Get the green
and let's get
ourselves gone.

14:57.708 --> 15:00.500
In daylight?

15:00.500 --> 15:02.375
Where you think we going?

15:03.458 --> 15:04.166
( phone ringing )

15:06.750 --> 15:09.291
Go on, handle that.

15:09.291 --> 15:10.666
Make 'em scat.
Go on.

15:10.666 --> 15:13.875
They hear me,
they gonna know
something wrong.

15:13.875 --> 15:17.166
You said you knew
about the telephone.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.666
Let it be.

15:19.666 --> 15:21.750
- These here ladies ain't--
- Father.

15:24.875 --> 15:27.750
He always calls to say
he's on his way.

15:29.625 --> 15:31.833
I can tell him
that everything--

15:36.250 --> 15:39.041
( breathing heavily )

15:45.166 --> 15:46.916
Damn.

15:46.916 --> 15:49.125
There a safe
in that cellar.

15:51.375 --> 15:53.125
Don't you tell me
otherwise.

15:53.125 --> 15:55.666
I done seen it
with my own eyes.

15:55.666 --> 15:57.250
I never forget it.

16:00.791 --> 16:04.208
Let's all head
on down there now.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.166
Do what he say.

16:14.958 --> 16:16.541
( clattering )

16:22.000 --> 16:23.250
( clattering )

16:26.375 --> 16:27.958
Where'd you move it?

16:27.958 --> 16:29.000
Don't be
signaling each other.
Answer up.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.708
- I--
- The bank.

16:30.708 --> 16:33.583
Father moved everything
to a safe deposit
in the bank.

16:33.583 --> 16:36.291
That's right.
All the valuables.

16:36.291 --> 16:37.000
Quite some time back.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.458
What's a safe deposit?

16:39.458 --> 16:40.833
They lock it up
for you.

16:42.125 --> 16:43.583
Inside the vault.

16:43.583 --> 16:46.000
Yes.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.625
We could go get it.

16:47.625 --> 16:50.083
- Fern and I.
- Milton: That so?

16:50.083 --> 16:52.250
Go into town,
tell them to open it up.

16:52.250 --> 16:54.958
And where we gonna be,
Miss Fern?

16:54.958 --> 16:57.500
You can wait here.
I'll wait with you.

16:57.500 --> 17:01.375
I'll wait and you go
into town.

17:01.375 --> 17:02.916
Is that all right?

17:03.791 --> 17:05.540
Asking him for?

17:05.540 --> 17:07.333
Three day
on the run with this man--
don't say nothing,

17:07.333 --> 17:10.333
don't ask nothing,
but he know all about
schools and banks.

17:10.333 --> 17:13.083
I'll stay,
Fern can go into town

17:13.083 --> 17:14.458
and get you
what you want.

17:14.458 --> 17:17.750
The Lord, the Lord,
the Lord.

17:19.833 --> 17:21.708
Buck.

17:27.375 --> 17:30.708
There ain't nothing
come from waiting.

17:30.708 --> 17:32.875
The father might show
and we don't need that.

17:32.875 --> 17:35.375
He up to Chambersburg.

17:35.375 --> 17:37.083
Don't matter where he is.

17:37.083 --> 17:38.500
Matter where we are.

17:44.458 --> 17:47.875
- What you got in mind?
- Tie 'em up.

17:47.875 --> 17:50.625
The father come back,
he find 'em.

17:50.625 --> 17:52.416
We get ourselves something
else along the way.

17:52.416 --> 17:55.666
- On the way to what?
- Wherever we headed.

17:58.541 --> 17:59.291
We ain't headed nowhere.

18:04.458 --> 18:07.083
Narcisse:
 How do you wish
 to be addressed?

18:07.083 --> 18:08.958
I'm good with Charlie.

18:08.958 --> 18:10.541
Benny.

18:10.541 --> 18:12.208
Ma called me
Pitseleh.

18:12.208 --> 18:13.625
Hmm.

18:13.625 --> 18:15.125
Friendly little names.

18:15.125 --> 18:15.833
Yourself?

18:15.833 --> 18:18.166
Whatever you prefer.

18:18.166 --> 18:21.125
Doctors make me
nervous.

18:21.125 --> 18:23.458
My concern is with the spirit
more so than with the body.

18:23.458 --> 18:26.375
Try that line on
the next skirt you chase.

18:26.375 --> 18:29.250
( chuckles )
Yes, indeed.

18:32.375 --> 18:36.375
You had that deal
with Joe the Boss.

18:36.375 --> 18:37.541
We engaged as necessary.

18:37.541 --> 18:40.791
Mr. Maranzano would
like it to continue.

18:40.791 --> 18:43.958
Perhaps one day
our paths will cross.

18:43.958 --> 18:46.583
That day is today.

18:46.583 --> 18:48.250
I beg your pardon?

18:48.250 --> 18:51.291
Mr. Maranzano is ready
to do business

18:51.291 --> 18:52.208
and offer his protection.

18:55.666 --> 18:58.041
Against what?

18:58.041 --> 18:59.958
Whatever problems
might turn up.

18:59.958 --> 19:02.416
( chuckles )

19:02.416 --> 19:05.041
You're in Harlem,
gentlemen.

19:05.041 --> 19:08.166
Uptown, downtown,
it's all New York.

19:08.166 --> 19:11.250
My experience
is otherwise.

19:15.333 --> 19:17.666
You got the policy game.

19:17.666 --> 19:20.375
The dope.
The clubs.

19:20.375 --> 19:22.583
And you got
all those whores.

19:24.625 --> 19:27.083
What I have
belongs to me.

19:27.083 --> 19:30.000
People are losing
things all over.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.583
Some guy,
he's a millionaire.

19:32.583 --> 19:34.666
Next thing you know,
he's selling Chiclets
in the street.

19:34.666 --> 19:36.708
Or worse.

19:36.708 --> 19:37.625
Chiclets?

19:37.625 --> 19:40.583
Holding on
to what you have,

19:40.583 --> 19:42.166
that sounds like
a good idea.

19:42.166 --> 19:46.500
That's what Mr. Maranzano
would like to help you with.

19:48.333 --> 19:50.375
And that's all
we had to say.

19:51.791 --> 19:54.666
I thank you both
for your concern.

19:54.666 --> 19:58.916
And I'm sorry

19:58.916 --> 20:01.375
you came up this far

20:01.375 --> 20:02.333
for nothing.

20:08.500 --> 20:11.000
What I love
about the city,

20:11.000 --> 20:12.916
everything's so close.

20:29.291 --> 20:31.875
- Man: Boy.
- Boy.

20:31.875 --> 20:34.041
- Boy.
- Boy.

20:34.041 --> 20:35.416
Boy.

20:35.416 --> 20:36.541
Can you drive
a pony cart?

20:36.541 --> 20:39.750
- I think so.
- All right, come on now.

20:39.750 --> 20:43.083
- Mr. Beckert--
- Leave 'em at the desk.

20:43.083 --> 20:45.333
- ( snapping fingers )
- Step lively.
Customer's waiting.

20:48.958 --> 20:50.541
- Mr. Thompson.
- How are you?

20:50.541 --> 20:52.458
Good to see you.
Please.

20:52.458 --> 20:54.750
- We'll have veal today?
- Absolutely.

20:57.750 --> 21:00.041
- After you.
- Thank you.

21:02.333 --> 21:04.250
Eight kids.
I add it up right?

21:04.250 --> 21:08.000
( laughs )
One short of a ball club.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.041
So number nine's
on the way.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.791
I thought you were
always on the road.

21:13.791 --> 21:16.375
So when I'm home,
I make it count.

21:17.083 --> 21:19.625
So how many have you?

21:19.625 --> 21:21.458
Two.

21:21.458 --> 21:23.333
Theodore and Emily.

21:23.333 --> 21:24.875
How old?

21:24.875 --> 21:27.583
In their teens.

21:27.583 --> 21:29.541
Goes by fast.

21:29.541 --> 21:30.541
Well, hop to it, old boy.

21:30.541 --> 21:33.000
Dynasties and rising
share prices.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.166
How's that?

21:34.166 --> 21:35.500
Safety in numbers.

21:35.500 --> 21:39.041
( chuckles )
My brother's got
that covered.

21:39.041 --> 21:40.708
Four boys
of his own.

21:40.708 --> 21:43.666
Ah, what line
is he in?

21:43.666 --> 21:46.625
He's looking after
our interests in Chicago.

21:46.625 --> 21:48.708
Family out there with him?

21:48.708 --> 21:51.541
His oldest, Will.
We're close.

21:51.541 --> 21:53.250
Like a son to me.

21:53.250 --> 21:55.375
Assistant US Attorney
in Manhattan.

21:55.375 --> 21:57.916
You walk close
to the edge.

21:57.916 --> 22:01.041
There's no law against
inside information.

22:01.041 --> 22:02.000
Knock wood.
( chuckles )

22:02.000 --> 22:03.583
( knocks on table )

22:03.583 --> 22:07.958
Oh, I took the liberty
of ordering for both of us.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.666
What on God's
green earth?

22:13.041 --> 22:15.041
Veal parmigiana.

22:15.041 --> 22:17.291
Chef Vola takes
an entire veal chop,

22:17.291 --> 22:19.916
slices it lengthwise,
breaded,

22:19.916 --> 22:21.791
fried in olive oil,

22:21.791 --> 22:23.583
drowned in cheese
and tomato sauce.

22:23.583 --> 22:25.250
I've seen wagon wheels
that were smaller.

22:29.833 --> 22:31.416
Some dago red
with that?

22:31.416 --> 22:33.166
I'll stick with coffee.

22:35.041 --> 22:36.958
You'll hurt
Vola's feelings.

22:36.958 --> 22:38.500
He's got some
big knives in there.

22:38.500 --> 22:40.208
Hmm, well,
I've no wish for that.

22:40.208 --> 22:42.916
It's just...

22:42.916 --> 22:45.791
it's hard enough doing
business as an Irish Catholic.

22:45.791 --> 22:48.708
I try my best
to thwart the notion

22:48.708 --> 22:49.333
that we're all drunkards.

22:54.791 --> 22:56.666
Hmm.

22:56.666 --> 22:58.166
You weren't lying.
It's delicious.

22:58.166 --> 23:01.416
Um, bring me
a seltzer instead.

23:07.416 --> 23:10.333
They judge us,
don't you think?

23:10.333 --> 23:12.250
The Brahmins
and their ilk.

23:12.250 --> 23:16.791
As if their fortunes
just wafted down

23:16.791 --> 23:18.333
from Episcopalian heaven.

23:18.333 --> 23:21.083
I've dealt with it
all my life.

23:21.083 --> 23:22.958
Money doesn't know
where it comes from.

23:22.958 --> 23:25.375
And it wouldn't
give a damn if it did.

23:25.375 --> 23:27.125
One generation--
that's all it takes
in this country

23:27.125 --> 23:30.916
if you play
your hand right.

23:30.916 --> 23:32.125
You have a gambler's
spirit, Joe.

23:34.583 --> 23:36.875
Gambling implies risk.

23:36.875 --> 23:38.500
I take the risk
out of it.

23:39.291 --> 23:41.916
How do you manage that?

23:41.916 --> 23:43.250
By rigging the game,
of course.

23:43.250 --> 23:46.291
What else is the stock market
good for?

23:46.291 --> 23:47.125
( laughs )

23:51.208 --> 23:52.125
There you are, sir.

23:57.500 --> 23:59.791
( car passing )

24:28.833 --> 24:31.583
There's beds upstairs.

24:33.458 --> 24:35.750
Must be a while
since you slept in one.

24:38.041 --> 24:40.583
Where can we go?
We can't go anywhere.

24:41.083 --> 24:43.500
( scoffs )

24:44.833 --> 24:48.583
Or you can walk out.

24:48.583 --> 24:50.583
You take the money.

24:50.583 --> 24:52.958
It ain't safe
by daylight.

24:52.958 --> 24:55.958
Cut across the field.

24:55.958 --> 24:57.916
No one would see you.

25:08.875 --> 25:11.458
You could take
his gun.

25:11.458 --> 25:13.875
Wouldn't you need that?

25:17.375 --> 25:19.833
I can tell that you--
you aren't like him.

25:19.833 --> 25:23.666
Yes, I am, ma'am.

25:25.708 --> 25:28.708
I absolutely am.

25:30.375 --> 25:33.291
And right now
I need you to shut
your mouth.

25:44.666 --> 25:46.958
- Your daughter--
- Quiet, Fern.

25:48.666 --> 25:50.750
Is she in school, too?

25:51.708 --> 25:54.041
How old is she?

25:55.875 --> 25:57.750
About your age.

25:57.750 --> 26:00.541
What's her name?

26:00.541 --> 26:03.333
You know my name.
My mother, she's Marie.

26:06.791 --> 26:09.166
Called her Maybelle.

26:09.166 --> 26:11.666
What a pretty name.

26:13.500 --> 26:15.375
Are you going to see her?
Is that where you're heading?

26:15.375 --> 26:17.708
You need to leave off now.

26:17.708 --> 26:20.583
- She must miss you.
- I said leave off.

26:20.583 --> 26:21.583
Fern.

26:21.583 --> 26:24.125
There's forgiveness
for everyone.

26:24.125 --> 26:25.625
That's what Jesus said.

26:25.625 --> 26:30.333
Baby girl,
Jesus was wrong.

26:30.333 --> 26:32.625
( car approaches )

26:32.625 --> 26:34.625
That's your father?

26:34.625 --> 26:37.750
- I--
- ( car door closes )

26:40.166 --> 26:42.708
( car engine idling )

26:44.958 --> 26:46.166
( knocks )

26:49.666 --> 26:52.083
( knocks )

26:59.416 --> 27:01.375
( car door opens )

27:05.708 --> 27:08.333
( car leaves )

27:37.791 --> 27:40.416
It's for Fern.

27:40.416 --> 27:42.000
For her spring formal.

28:19.750 --> 28:21.041
Put it on.

28:21.041 --> 28:23.333
I'm talking.
Look at me.

28:26.833 --> 28:28.875
Put it on.

28:46.750 --> 28:49.208
Put it on proper.

29:16.166 --> 29:18.208
It's upstairs.

29:18.208 --> 29:20.208
The safe is upstairs.

29:20.208 --> 29:23.375
We had to move it
because the--

29:23.375 --> 29:26.208
because the cellar
flooded.

29:26.208 --> 29:28.291
That's what you came
here for, isn't it?

29:31.625 --> 29:32.708
Mind your tea black?

29:32.708 --> 29:35.416
Not at all.

29:35.416 --> 29:38.708
I don't keep milk
in the house anymore.

29:38.708 --> 29:40.208
Turns my stomach.

29:42.750 --> 29:44.750
Thank you for taking
the time, Mrs. Rothstein.

29:44.750 --> 29:47.750
Carolyn.

29:47.750 --> 29:49.750
Margaret.

29:52.375 --> 29:54.041
Won't you join me?

29:54.041 --> 29:56.083
You go ahead.

30:07.250 --> 30:10.458
Mr. Bennett had so many
clients through the years.

30:10.458 --> 30:13.916
Frankly, I barely
remember your husband.

30:13.916 --> 30:15.291
But as soon
as I learned--

30:15.291 --> 30:17.500
You live in one
of his apartment buildings.

30:19.666 --> 30:21.291
Do I?

30:21.291 --> 30:22.833
Don't work it so hard.

30:22.833 --> 30:24.541
It's not like you were
his only mistress.

30:24.541 --> 30:26.333
What?

30:26.333 --> 30:29.791
West 57th, East 44th,

30:29.791 --> 30:32.791
Leroy or Leonard,
I can't remember which.

30:32.791 --> 30:35.916
- Mrs. Rothstein.
- Carolyn.

30:35.916 --> 30:37.750
Carolyn.

30:39.541 --> 30:42.958
Your husband and I had
a business arrangement.

30:42.958 --> 30:45.375
I gave him information
on a stock sale.

30:45.375 --> 30:47.583
- That's all.
- In exchange for what?

30:47.583 --> 30:51.875
The apartment for myself
and my children.

30:51.875 --> 30:54.291
And when he died?

30:54.291 --> 30:57.291
I couldn't stop
my employer from--

30:57.291 --> 30:58.458
19 years of marriage.

30:58.458 --> 31:01.958
Do you know what
I have to show for it?

31:01.958 --> 31:06.083
This tea set,
that hideous chair,

31:06.083 --> 31:07.708
this ring.

31:07.708 --> 31:10.333
Oh, and humiliation.

31:10.333 --> 31:11.416
Arnold left me
buckets of that.

31:11.416 --> 31:14.333
Everything else
I've had to sell.

31:17.583 --> 31:21.833
I know what
it is to struggle
and I'm sorry for--

31:21.833 --> 31:23.166
I want the money
that was in that account.

31:23.166 --> 31:25.208
My lawyer says
it's open and shut.

31:25.208 --> 31:27.875
He's looked into it
very thoroughly,

31:27.875 --> 31:29.750
found out all sorts
of things.

31:29.750 --> 31:32.333
Conors & Gould
is close to bankrupt.

31:32.333 --> 31:34.125
Then I'll sue you
personally.

31:35.833 --> 31:36.875
I've nothing
like that amount.

31:36.875 --> 31:39.208
Your husband does.

31:39.208 --> 31:43.208
I'm not married.
I'm a widow.

31:43.208 --> 31:44.500
Do you know where
this is from?

31:44.500 --> 31:48.541
Arnold gave it to me.
He got it at a party.

31:48.541 --> 31:50.250
They brought out a trunk
full of jewelry.

31:50.250 --> 31:53.625
People trampled
each other to grab it.

31:53.625 --> 31:56.250
Just the sort of thing
that amused him.

31:56.250 --> 31:58.333
New Year's Eve 1923.

31:58.333 --> 32:04.666
The home of Mr. and Mrs.
Nucky Thompson.

32:04.666 --> 32:06.291
Tell me again
there's no money.

32:08.875 --> 32:12.791
Carolyn, please.

32:12.791 --> 32:15.583
You're hurt
and angry.

32:15.583 --> 32:18.958
I understand more
than you realize.

32:18.958 --> 32:21.416
But...

32:21.416 --> 32:24.458
you and I have
a great deal in common.

32:24.458 --> 32:27.708
No, we don't, sweetie.
But we're going to.

32:27.708 --> 32:29.125
Let's see how
you like reading
your name in the paper

32:29.125 --> 32:33.416
next to
"notorious husband."

32:37.625 --> 32:40.958
- ( boat horn blaring )
- ( seagulls screeching )

32:47.791 --> 32:50.083
( snoring )

33:33.500 --> 33:37.500
"Enoch walked with God
and he was no more."

33:37.500 --> 33:39.208
What?

33:39.208 --> 33:41.291
It's from the Bible.

33:41.291 --> 33:43.500
I know that.

33:43.500 --> 33:45.041
Do you know
what it means?

33:45.041 --> 33:46.833
Do you?

33:46.833 --> 33:48.166
It means he didn't die.

33:50.541 --> 33:52.125
Where do you get that?

33:52.125 --> 33:54.666
I didn't get it anywhere.
That's what it means.

33:54.666 --> 33:56.000
If he didn't die,
where'd he go?

33:56.000 --> 33:59.000
He walked with God.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.041
That's going in circles.

34:00.041 --> 34:02.833
Maybe it's too hard
for you.

34:02.833 --> 34:04.750
It just doesn't
make sense.

34:04.750 --> 34:07.125
It doesn't
have to make sense.
It's the Bible.

34:07.125 --> 34:09.625
He lived to be
365 years old.

34:09.625 --> 34:12.416
And then he walked
with God?

34:14.166 --> 34:16.416
Do you have to do
whatever anyone tells you?

34:17.083 --> 34:19.708
My job, I reckon.

34:19.708 --> 34:23.291
If I paid you 10 cents,
would you kiss...

34:25.583 --> 34:28.541
this pony?

34:28.541 --> 34:29.958
You don't have 10 cents.

34:29.958 --> 34:33.833
You were watching me.

34:33.833 --> 34:36.000
- Huh?
- In the grass.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.416
No, I wasn't.

34:37.416 --> 34:39.958
Woman:
 Darling.

34:39.958 --> 34:41.916
Let's wet our feet.

34:41.916 --> 34:44.041
Yes, Mother.

34:52.625 --> 34:54.000
Hey!

35:16.750 --> 35:19.291
Mr. Beckert.

35:21.166 --> 35:24.416
I brought the flowers
round, but there wasn't
anyone there.

35:25.708 --> 35:27.583
Oh.

35:27.583 --> 35:29.708
Well...

35:30.875 --> 35:33.125
make sure she gets them.

35:33.125 --> 35:37.000
( music playing )

35:37.000 --> 35:39.125
( men cheering )

35:42.583 --> 35:44.958
( whistling )

35:59.375 --> 36:02.375
- Man: Whoo!
- ( cheering, whistling )

36:04.000 --> 36:06.083
Woman:
 Yeah, she's gorgeous!

36:06.083 --> 36:08.291
Woman #2:
 You've got it, baby!

36:10.500 --> 36:12.833
Man #2:
Oh, yeah!

36:12.833 --> 36:15.166
Come on, honey,
let's see 'em.

36:15.166 --> 36:18.250
Don't be shy.
We're all friends.

36:21.291 --> 36:23.375
Imagine the drinks
are your profit center here.

36:23.375 --> 36:25.916
Man:
 Whoo! Come on!

36:25.916 --> 36:29.666
- How's that?
- I said the booze must be
what keeps your lights on.

36:29.666 --> 36:32.625
2,000% markup,
it damn well better.

36:33.833 --> 36:36.833
- Holy mackerel!
- Is that what I smell?

36:36.833 --> 36:39.000
( laughing )

36:39.000 --> 36:42.291
General Motors convention.

36:42.291 --> 36:44.500
So their engines
aren't the only things
that run hot.

36:50.500 --> 36:51.916
( chuckles )

36:51.916 --> 36:53.791
Talented young lady.

36:55.041 --> 36:58.250
Kitty?
I'm sure she'd
love to meet you.

36:58.250 --> 37:00.666
Come on, take it
off already.

37:00.666 --> 37:02.125
Want me to catch cold?

37:02.125 --> 37:04.791
Man:
 Drop it, baby!
 Come on!

37:04.791 --> 37:07.333
( cheering )

37:11.916 --> 37:15.000
Courtesy
of Mr. Doyle, sir.

37:15.000 --> 37:15.916
What?

37:15.916 --> 37:17.166
Take them away.

37:17.166 --> 37:19.333
Bring us two
seltzer waters.

37:19.333 --> 37:21.416
- Make mine a tonic.
- A what?

37:21.416 --> 37:24.541
- Cola-Cola.
- Yes, sir.

37:28.583 --> 37:29.791
- What the fuck happened?
- He sent it back.

37:29.791 --> 37:32.708
Wants a soda.

37:32.708 --> 37:35.375
- That's the good stuff.
- I'm telling you
what he said.

37:35.375 --> 37:37.291
Whoa, Madame Curie.
Give me that.

37:55.916 --> 37:59.666
( men shouting )

38:01.500 --> 38:02.875
Let's see 'em!

38:02.875 --> 38:05.125
( cheering )

38:06.875 --> 38:08.833
Seltzer and a Cola-Cola.

38:08.833 --> 38:11.416
Thank you, dear.

38:14.750 --> 38:17.833
What goes well with that--
some Bacardi Rum.

38:17.833 --> 38:19.750
- Ah.
- I am told.

38:19.750 --> 38:23.041
Has the moment arrived
for serious discussion?

38:29.458 --> 38:32.166
Ready if you are.

38:32.166 --> 38:34.125
I'd say that fella
is likely to beat us
both to the punch.

38:35.958 --> 38:38.083
Jesus fucking Christ.

38:44.125 --> 38:47.125
Well, his timing
was impeccable.

38:48.083 --> 38:50.208
( cheering continues )

38:57.166 --> 38:59.583
( banging )

39:06.958 --> 39:08.500
What you stopping for?

39:08.500 --> 39:12.291
- Ain't getting nowhere.
- Put your back into it.

39:12.291 --> 39:13.416
The hell else
you been doing for
the last seven years?

39:13.416 --> 39:16.375
You think I mean
to keep on doing it?

39:18.375 --> 39:20.333
What else you good for?

39:22.375 --> 39:25.333
I got you out
of them chains,
didn't I?

39:28.541 --> 39:29.291
Give me that.

39:33.625 --> 39:36.125
( banging )

39:42.250 --> 39:45.666
This ain't it.
This ain't the one I saw.

39:45.666 --> 39:48.375
It's all we have.
All there's ever been.

39:48.375 --> 39:50.791
Watch me break my back,
he don't give me nothing.

39:50.791 --> 39:52.416
That'll do.

39:52.416 --> 39:54.833
- Father wouldn't--
- How you open it?!

39:54.833 --> 39:56.750
I told you, my husband
has the combination.

39:56.750 --> 39:58.291
He's never
given it to me.

39:58.291 --> 40:00.500
I'd open it if I could.
Why wouldn't I?

40:00.500 --> 40:01.666
- Your husband?
- Yes.

40:01.666 --> 40:06.000
He up in Chambersburg.
All day, all night.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.208
Mm-hmm.

40:08.208 --> 40:10.166
Maybe he ain't
never come home.

40:10.166 --> 40:11.208
He will.

40:15.041 --> 40:17.375
He does.

40:18.875 --> 40:21.583
- ( shouting )
- ( screams )

40:31.083 --> 40:33.958
No man's clothes
in that closet.

40:33.958 --> 40:36.083
None in the drawers.

40:36.083 --> 40:38.458
Ain't no man's razor
in that cupboard.

40:38.458 --> 40:40.291
No man's nothing
in this whole house.

40:44.916 --> 40:46.625
( hammer drops )

40:46.625 --> 40:49.500
I see that.

40:49.500 --> 40:50.875
You think I'm simple.

40:51.875 --> 40:55.083
( whimpering )

40:55.083 --> 40:56.458
I see everything.

40:56.458 --> 41:00.083
I'll open it!
I'll open it!
I'll open it!

41:00.083 --> 41:01.416
Please!

41:03.541 --> 41:06.416
( combination lock
clicking )

41:08.708 --> 41:11.375
Liberty bonds
from the war.

41:11.375 --> 41:14.291
They're nothing to you.
It's all he left us.

41:14.291 --> 41:17.458
It's the only thing
we have.

41:19.291 --> 41:21.166
Chalky:
 Buck.

41:27.333 --> 41:29.666
- ( shouts )
- ( choking )

41:42.583 --> 41:44.875
( Fern panting )

41:44.875 --> 41:46.833
( gun cocks )

41:46.833 --> 41:48.875
Maybelle.

41:52.083 --> 41:52.791
What?

41:52.791 --> 41:56.250
Her name, you said.

41:59.791 --> 42:01.750
That right.

42:01.750 --> 42:04.333
Does she know
what you are?

42:08.500 --> 42:10.166
She knew what I was.

42:14.916 --> 42:19.041
Take the $9 and get
out of our house.

42:23.333 --> 42:25.833
( music playing )

42:28.750 --> 42:30.250
( men cheering )

42:53.208 --> 42:55.416
The crow's nest
of the HMS Thompson.

42:55.416 --> 42:58.291
Nucky:
Spot anything
worth harpooning?

42:58.291 --> 43:01.875
( laughs )

43:01.875 --> 43:04.583
You a sailor, Nucky?
Must be.

43:04.583 --> 43:06.500
Growing up
near the ocean.

43:06.500 --> 43:07.583
My father was.

43:07.583 --> 43:10.458
Merchant marine.
Before I was born.

43:10.458 --> 43:13.083
What did he make
of himself?

43:14.125 --> 43:16.166
Not a lot,
tell you the truth.

43:17.541 --> 43:19.541
Maybe it's what
you needed.

43:19.541 --> 43:20.791
How's that?

43:20.791 --> 43:22.333
Fire in your belly.

43:23.291 --> 43:26.000
I don't think
about it much.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.375
My father taught my brother
and me to sail off Nantucket

43:29.375 --> 43:32.291
and now I'm doing the same
for my own boys.

43:32.291 --> 43:34.416
Handing it down.

43:34.416 --> 43:36.541
Feel like you're part
of something bigger.

43:36.541 --> 43:38.625
Why else do we do
all this?

43:38.625 --> 43:40.916
Bacardi would make
for a nice inheritance.

43:40.916 --> 43:43.125
I was slow-footed there.
You beat me to it.

43:43.125 --> 43:46.541
Doesn't have to be
a contest.

43:46.541 --> 43:48.458
Isn't it always?

43:48.458 --> 43:50.583
Not if we go in
together.

43:50.583 --> 43:52.416
Why you?

43:52.416 --> 43:55.375
Why wouldn't I partner
with King Solomon

43:55.375 --> 43:56.541
or others of his kind?

43:56.541 --> 43:57.875
They've made offers.

43:57.875 --> 44:00.583
Those men are gangsters.

44:01.666 --> 44:03.958
What are you?

44:03.958 --> 44:07.541
An advocate
for repeal.

44:12.666 --> 44:14.583
I'm standing
in your office

44:14.583 --> 44:18.375
and nary a photo,

44:18.375 --> 44:19.708
a card,

44:19.708 --> 44:22.041
child's drawing.

44:22.041 --> 44:24.125
What's that got to do
with making money?

44:24.125 --> 44:25.166
It's what you're
making it for.

44:28.666 --> 44:31.833
Nephew who's like a son,
how old is he?

44:31.833 --> 44:33.833
What are you
trying to prove?

44:33.833 --> 44:37.416
That you've got
a better excuse than me
for being a crook?

44:37.416 --> 44:40.666
We can play with words,
but I've never broken
a law in my life.

44:42.000 --> 44:43.750
I'd call that
a technicality.

44:43.750 --> 44:44.916
I call that good business.

44:44.916 --> 44:47.833
If that helps you sleep.

44:47.833 --> 44:50.583
( chuckles )

44:50.583 --> 44:52.208
I'll make you an offer.

44:52.208 --> 44:56.083
You tell me
what you really want

44:56.083 --> 44:58.166
and I'll tell you
if we have a deal.

45:01.375 --> 45:03.416
I'm not interested.

45:03.416 --> 45:07.041
Then I'll thank you
for your hospitality

45:07.041 --> 45:09.416
and leave you free
to have your drink.

45:18.125 --> 45:21.208
I want...

45:21.208 --> 45:23.291
to leave something behind.

45:35.916 --> 45:37.458
The young lady
from earlier.

45:37.458 --> 45:38.458
Kitty, was it?

45:38.458 --> 45:41.041
Yes.

45:49.166 --> 45:51.583
( liquid pouring )

45:53.416 --> 45:54.958
Well...

45:59.333 --> 46:02.000
perhaps I'll bring her
a saucer of milk.

46:06.500 --> 46:08.291
( door opens )

46:11.291 --> 46:12.833
( door closes )

46:31.166 --> 46:34.375
( muffled voices talking )

46:50.958 --> 46:52.541
What are you doing?

46:52.541 --> 46:54.875
Fresh flowers.

46:56.500 --> 46:57.291
Lou.

47:07.666 --> 47:09.458
Downstairs, now.

47:09.458 --> 47:11.416
Tend to your duties.

47:19.500 --> 47:22.000
What is this?
Bulls?

47:27.125 --> 47:29.250
Nah, just some fella.

47:35.916 --> 47:38.500
Evening, gents.

47:38.500 --> 47:40.666
Any of you boys
seen a pie I left cooling
on my windowsill?

47:40.666 --> 47:43.333
( laughs )

47:43.333 --> 47:45.583
We don't want
no trouble, mister.

47:45.583 --> 47:47.500
I'm pulling your leg.

47:47.500 --> 47:49.333
Enjoy your soup.

47:49.333 --> 47:50.791
Or whatever that is.

47:50.791 --> 47:53.625
I need eight men
to load trucks for
Mr. Thompson.

47:53.625 --> 47:55.958
- Pays good.
- ( all clamoring )

47:55.958 --> 47:58.791
Pick me, mister.
I'm strong as an ox.

47:58.791 --> 47:59.625
Probably smart
as one, too.
( laughs )

47:59.625 --> 48:01.291
Excuse me?

48:03.875 --> 48:06.416
How old are you, kid?

48:06.416 --> 48:07.750
18.

48:07.750 --> 48:10.541
Is that how you want
to start our relationship?

48:10.541 --> 48:13.125
I'll be 16 next month.

48:13.125 --> 48:15.958
So I thought.

48:15.958 --> 48:20.125
One, two, three,

48:20.125 --> 48:24.166
four, five,

48:24.166 --> 48:25.708
six,

48:25.708 --> 48:28.833
seven, eight.

48:28.833 --> 48:30.916
After you.

48:30.916 --> 48:32.416
Come on, mister,
give me a chance.

48:32.416 --> 48:33.875
I've worked a farm
since I'm a kid.

48:33.875 --> 48:35.583
Ooh, since you're a kid?

48:35.583 --> 48:37.166
Why didn't you say so?

48:37.166 --> 48:41.083
Please, mister.
I'll give you
half my pay.

48:41.083 --> 48:42.125
I'm real hungry is all.

48:46.625 --> 48:49.458
Nine.

48:53.541 --> 48:56.750
- ( music playing )
- ( knocking on door )

48:56.750 --> 48:59.125
Woman:
Sounds like
we got a customer.

48:59.125 --> 49:02.583
( women chatting,
laughing )

49:02.583 --> 49:04.500
What can I do you
gentlemen for tonight?

49:08.541 --> 49:10.791
In the mood
for some dark meat.

49:10.791 --> 49:12.833
It's the only kind
of turkey we got.

49:12.833 --> 49:14.833
Your girls clean?

49:14.833 --> 49:16.958
Doctor's very particular
when it comes to hygiene.

49:22.833 --> 49:23.833
Take yourselves
a gander.

49:23.833 --> 49:25.625
Tell me what you like.

49:25.625 --> 49:27.250
Hey, sugar.

49:30.000 --> 49:32.125
I don't know.

49:32.125 --> 49:34.375
What do you think?

49:36.833 --> 49:38.458
- Hey! What the fuck is going--
- ( gunshots )

49:38.458 --> 49:41.541
( women screaming )

49:42.958 --> 49:45.708
( screaming stops )

49:54.875 --> 49:57.333
- Boy.
- Yes, Mr. Whiting?

49:57.333 --> 49:59.208
Someone left this
for you.

50:15.458 --> 50:17.916
I saw him yesterday.

50:17.916 --> 50:19.583
On the beach
south of town.

50:21.291 --> 50:23.583
It's taken care of.

50:23.583 --> 50:25.875
You caught him?

50:25.875 --> 50:27.791
I did what's right.

50:29.041 --> 50:32.083
He said he loved her.

50:32.083 --> 50:34.833
You don't know what
people are thinking.

50:34.833 --> 50:38.000
You can't stop
every bad thing.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.166
It's just how it is.

50:45.125 --> 50:47.291
This is all between us.
Understand?

50:47.291 --> 50:52.083
Otherwise, it's bad
for business.

50:52.083 --> 50:54.458
Man:
 Chairs, swimming togs
 and toys.

50:54.458 --> 50:57.583
You, sir, you look
like you need to relax.

50:57.583 --> 50:58.708
Would you like
a chair, sir?

50:58.708 --> 51:00.458
Yes, ma'am, how about
an umbrella?

51:00.458 --> 51:04.125
Selling toys and togs
for the kiddies.

51:04.125 --> 51:06.625
One-of-a-kind
pails and shovels.

51:06.625 --> 51:08.166
Dig all the way to China,
boys and girls.
