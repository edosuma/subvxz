WEBVTT

00:02.861 --> 00:05.195
Well, that one diner has the best bacon.
So I don't know. Great bacon.

00:05.197 --> 00:06.630
Ugh, come on, guys. Please, God,
we're entering minute 20

00:06.632 --> 00:07.831
of the great brunch debate.
The other diner

00:07.833 --> 00:10.767
does have that
special fruit cup.

00:10.769 --> 00:12.302
Other diner. Fruit cup.
Let's go. However,

00:12.304 --> 00:13.937
when I think about
it, huge crowd

00:13.939 --> 00:15.839
looking for that special fruit cup.
Smart.

00:15.841 --> 00:18.175
So now we got to think line versus bacon.
Please, I am starving.

00:18.177 --> 00:20.444
Make a decision. Oh, hi.

00:20.446 --> 00:21.712
Do you guys want to
join us? We are going

00:21.714 --> 00:23.213
for brunch in seven days.

00:23.215 --> 00:24.648
Hybrid meals are
for people who are too lazy

00:24.650 --> 00:26.149
to wake up
for a proper breakfast.

00:26.151 --> 00:29.453
Besides, we're looking
for a wedding venue today.

00:29.455 --> 00:31.321
Good luck with these two,
because if they get

00:31.323 --> 00:33.824
really hungry, then all bets are off.
Curveball--

00:33.826 --> 00:37.327
maybe we roast a turkey.
Have either of you ever made

00:37.329 --> 00:38.695
a decision in your lives?

00:38.697 --> 00:40.330
I make decisions all the time.
Disrespectful.

00:40.332 --> 00:42.065
What's the last decision that you made?
First of all,

00:42.067 --> 00:43.667
you got to make a decision
if you gonna make a decision.

00:43.669 --> 00:46.136
You know what I mean?
(whistles, mimics explosion)

00:46.138 --> 00:47.571
Of course we make decisions.
How do you think

00:47.573 --> 00:49.039
I'm wearing clothes
right now?

00:49.041 --> 00:50.173
I laid those out
for you, Nick.

00:50.175 --> 00:51.675
But I decided to let you.
This is

00:51.677 --> 00:53.477
your whole problem. Imagine
how much better your life

00:53.479 --> 00:56.346
would be if you could just make a decision.
She's just mad

00:56.348 --> 00:58.715
because she had a bunch
of dumb brunch ideas,

00:58.717 --> 01:01.551
you damn fool. (laughs)
(laughs)

01:01.553 --> 01:03.987
Okay. Uh, well, what about this?
I will sleep

01:03.989 --> 01:06.656
with one of you tonight
if you can just decide who.

01:12.431 --> 01:14.297
♪ ♪

01:16.402 --> 01:19.102
Are you... are you serious?
I mean,

01:19.104 --> 01:20.737
we're talking about
a one-time thing and you can't

01:20.739 --> 01:22.572
get weird afterwards,
but, yeah, I'm...

01:22.574 --> 01:24.708
down for, like,
a fun half hour.

01:24.710 --> 01:26.610
And you would be there? Yes.

01:26.612 --> 01:28.545
You would
physically be there?

01:28.547 --> 01:29.446
Yes.

01:32.785 --> 01:36.052
Can it... be nice?

01:36.054 --> 01:38.288
Well, that's on you.
Let me know by 9:00.

01:38.290 --> 01:40.424
What if we die before then? There's
not much I can do about that.

01:40.426 --> 01:42.259
Okay, you know what, you know
what, we'll discuss this

01:42.261 --> 01:44.261
amongst ourselves.
I mean, uh,

01:44.263 --> 01:46.263
nobody wants to see
how the sausage is made,

01:46.265 --> 01:48.698
am I right? No, they don't.
To the sausage factory.

01:48.700 --> 01:50.400
What?
That's not what I meant.

01:50.402 --> 01:52.469
Yeah. Let's go.
All right.

01:52.471 --> 01:53.870
Thank you for the opportunity.
Good luck

01:53.872 --> 01:56.306
with your decision.
(door closes)

01:56.308 --> 01:58.375
At what cost?

01:58.377 --> 02:00.377
One sexual barracuda
to another,

02:00.379 --> 02:02.212
I see what you're doing.

02:02.214 --> 02:03.547
You're doing it
for the story.

02:03.549 --> 02:05.749
You want to see
how deep the abyss goes.

02:05.751 --> 02:07.717
You want to look that monster
straight into the eye.

02:07.719 --> 02:10.554
Maybe it's so bad
that it's good.

02:10.556 --> 02:12.956
But it's not good.
It's b... it's bad.

02:12.958 --> 02:14.224
CECE:
Okay, honey, calm down.

02:14.226 --> 02:16.960
She's not actually gonna do it.
No,

02:16.962 --> 02:18.495
I'm trying to teach them
a lesson.

02:18.497 --> 02:20.096
This isn't an '80s
summer camp movie.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.132
I'm not gonna sleep
with somebody based on a bet.

02:22.134 --> 02:24.134
I'm just... I was
just kind of playing along

02:24.136 --> 02:26.770
with the whole thing just in case
they were listening at the door.

02:26.772 --> 02:28.738
Something
about "summer camp moogie."

02:28.740 --> 02:29.673
"Summer camp moogie."

02:29.675 --> 02:31.141
No, no, no. I got nothing.

02:31.143 --> 02:32.242
This isn't real, right?

02:32.244 --> 02:33.477
It can't be.
(laughs)

02:33.479 --> 02:35.345
I mean...
I mean, it can't be.

02:35.347 --> 02:37.347
Why would it be? But on
the off chance that it is,

02:37.349 --> 02:40.183
we need to take this
extremely seriously.

02:40.185 --> 02:42.586
You're absolutely right. Okay,
okay. Well, what do you suggest?

02:42.588 --> 02:44.488
(sputters)
We do a gentlemen's debate.

02:44.490 --> 02:47.491
A gentlemen's debate. We calmly
discuss who merits this opportunity

02:47.493 --> 02:50.026
and we come to a decision based
off respect and politeness.

02:50.028 --> 02:51.528
I agree. So...

02:51.530 --> 02:53.497
please proceed, sir.

02:53.499 --> 02:54.431
Thank you, sir.

02:54.433 --> 02:55.932
You're welcome, sir.

02:55.934 --> 02:57.834
(chuckling)

02:57.836 --> 02:59.369
Okay.

02:59.371 --> 03:02.372
The gentleman knows that I have
a monster crush on Reagan.

03:02.374 --> 03:04.674
But because this is such
a powerful argument

03:04.676 --> 03:07.444
in my favor, I politely take it
off the table.

03:07.446 --> 03:10.280
In that case,
the gentleman politely...

03:10.282 --> 03:11.781
thanks you.

03:14.219 --> 03:18.655
Hmm. The gentleman was sure
that the other<i> gentleman</i>

03:18.657 --> 03:20.323
would not be such a jerk

03:20.325 --> 03:23.159
and let his friend's
dreams come true.

03:23.161 --> 03:25.729
Perhaps I'm not dealing
with a gentleman at all.

03:25.731 --> 03:27.998
Perhaps I'm dealing
with a dingus.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.033
Did you call me a dingus?
You're acting like a dingus.

03:30.035 --> 03:31.401
How can I be a dingus when
you're the damn dingus?

03:31.403 --> 03:33.236
You're the dingus. You're the
d... you're-you're... you are...

03:33.238 --> 03:35.338
Oh. Hey. Hey. Looking forward

03:35.340 --> 03:37.307
to sex later. Well,
that makes three of...

03:37.309 --> 03:39.309
That makes two of us.
Well, get ready

03:39.311 --> 03:43.813
for the skin circus,
you little peanut.

03:43.815 --> 03:45.849
Okay.
Whoa.

03:45.851 --> 03:47.250
I was put
in an awkward situation,

03:47.252 --> 03:48.718
and I reacted poorly.
Oh, whoa.

03:48.720 --> 03:50.320
Everything rides
on this decision.

03:50.322 --> 03:53.189
You know, the venue is the axle
of the wedding chariot.

03:53.191 --> 03:54.858
I know that you have
dreamed about this day

03:54.860 --> 03:56.760
since you were a little boy,
but we are paying for this out

03:56.762 --> 03:59.596
of our own pocket, okay?
So we cannot get carried away.

03:59.598 --> 04:01.164
Okay.

04:01.166 --> 04:02.866
MAN: Yeah.
(door opens)

04:02.868 --> 04:04.668
MAN: Oh, I see...
Okay, this could work.

04:04.670 --> 04:06.670
(instrument crackling)

04:06.672 --> 04:08.171
(crackling continues)
Yeah... Huh?

04:08.173 --> 04:09.673
(grunts)

04:09.675 --> 04:11.207
Oh, my God. No.
Oh!

04:11.209 --> 04:13.009
Some tea lights

04:13.011 --> 04:15.045
and flowers and this place
could be nice.

04:15.047 --> 04:17.047
It's like a Mumford & Sons
music video, yeah?

04:17.049 --> 04:18.915
Is there hay in here?

04:19.885 --> 04:21.084
We're looking for

04:21.086 --> 04:23.553
the vacant warehouse
for the wedding venue?

04:23.555 --> 04:24.888
Vacant warehouse?
They're closing us down.

04:24.890 --> 04:26.723
We're all getting fired.

04:26.725 --> 04:28.625
Grab what you can! Hey, you
guys, kind of not cool.

04:28.627 --> 04:30.360
You were supposed to text me
before you got here. Okay.

04:30.362 --> 04:32.062
Can everyone just
take a seat, please?

04:32.064 --> 04:34.598
Can you just stop? Take...
(woman whimpering)

04:34.600 --> 04:36.199
Hey, you...

04:36.201 --> 04:38.101
NICK: Me owe you?
You ditched me

04:38.103 --> 04:39.869
when we were supposed
to run away from home together.

04:39.871 --> 04:41.905
I built that raft for nothing!

04:41.907 --> 04:44.874
We could do this all day, but
I have actual feelings for her.

04:44.876 --> 04:46.215
I thought you said feelings
were off the table.

04:46.241 --> 04:47.243
Well, I'm putting 'em back

04:47.245 --> 04:49.412
on the table. I'm gonna settle
this right here, right now.

04:49.414 --> 04:50.614
Do it.
Cindy...

04:50.616 --> 04:52.816
No.

04:52.818 --> 04:53.650
...De La Garza.

04:53.652 --> 04:55.752
Oh.
Huh, so look at me.

04:55.754 --> 04:58.488
Look at me.
Let it affect you.

04:58.490 --> 05:01.925
<i> You knew I had a crush</i>
<i> on Cindy De La Garza,</i>

05:01.927 --> 05:04.294
<i> and you Frenched her anyway. </i>
(gasps)

05:04.296 --> 05:06.296
Frenching! They're Frenching!
They're Fren...

05:06.298 --> 05:08.498
Hey, chaperone!

05:08.500 --> 05:10.734
<i> They're</i> Frenching!
Aah!

05:10.736 --> 05:12.902
I had dibs on her
since the fifth grade, dude!

05:12.904 --> 05:15.138
If I could un-French her, I would.
You owe me this.

05:15.140 --> 05:17.607
I knew that French
was gonna haunt me.

05:17.609 --> 05:20.343
You called dibs...
and I screwed up.

05:20.345 --> 05:22.012
What you gonna say? What you gonna say?
It's you.

05:22.014 --> 05:24.014
Oh, yes. Man, that girl
better get ready

05:24.016 --> 05:28.118
for some kind,
attentive lovemaking. Oh.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.487
Hey, uh, have you guys seen
my purple sweater?

05:30.489 --> 05:34.090
Uh, no. And, by the way,
we've made our decision.

05:34.092 --> 05:35.992
Wow. That was fast.
You have until 9:00.

05:35.994 --> 05:36.993
We don't need it.

05:36.995 --> 05:38.328
You'll be having Winston.

05:38.330 --> 05:40.597
That's me. I'm Winston.
Great. Don't eat

05:40.599 --> 05:41.965
for two hours before. I'm
really looking forward to it.

05:41.967 --> 05:45.035
Bring your A-game, okay?
Any previous injuries

05:45.037 --> 05:46.936
that I need to know about?
Bring something

05:46.938 --> 05:48.004
to numb your mouth.

05:49.775 --> 05:52.008
Oh. Look.

05:52.010 --> 05:54.577
The sweater was in my hand
the whole time.

06:00.452 --> 06:01.967
You know, this woman requested my A-game.
My A-game.

06:01.993 --> 06:03.253
Maybe it's hopeless
that I could even

06:03.255 --> 06:05.655
please this woman sexually.
What am I thinking, Winston?

06:05.657 --> 06:08.491
Just focus on yourself. Concentrate
on yourself sexually, Winston.

06:08.493 --> 06:11.294
No, Winston, that is not your way.
I just want

06:11.296 --> 06:14.464
to head off any discussion
of what your way is.

06:14.466 --> 06:17.667
I'm so sorry. I'm just feeling
a little insecure about my body

06:17.669 --> 06:21.237
and the way it is connected
to my face.

06:21.239 --> 06:23.673
Bishop... (sighs)

06:23.675 --> 06:26.743
you have nothing to worry about.

06:26.745 --> 06:28.878
Really?

06:28.880 --> 06:30.580
Yeah.

06:30.582 --> 06:32.816
Okay. What's my best feature?

06:32.818 --> 06:34.818
Instant regret. Instant.

06:34.820 --> 06:37.153
The second I said it,
I was like...

06:37.155 --> 06:38.388
If you had to pick.
Fine.

06:38.390 --> 06:40.657
You have very nice...

06:40.659 --> 06:42.592
That's our suspect. He's taking off!
What?

06:42.594 --> 06:44.160
Okay.
(siren wailing)

06:44.162 --> 06:45.762
Okay, I'll let you take point
on this one,

06:45.764 --> 06:47.597
because I got to protect my duke
for later.

06:47.599 --> 06:49.199
Oh, you suck so much.

06:49.201 --> 06:51.101
Has that park always
been a pet cemetery

06:51.103 --> 06:53.436
or were just crazy people
burying a dog there?

06:53.438 --> 06:55.271
Well, I'm not even close
to giving up.

06:55.273 --> 06:57.540
Why don't we just pop in here?

06:57.542 --> 07:01.911
Oh, really? We just "happened"
upon The Lisbon, Schmidt?

07:01.913 --> 07:05.248
Purely a coincidence that
we... made it just on time

07:05.250 --> 07:07.016
for the appointment
that I made a month ago.

07:07.018 --> 07:08.518
Why are you doing this
to yourself?

07:08.520 --> 07:10.253
(classical music playing)

07:10.255 --> 07:12.422
Ah. Mr. Schmidt.

07:12.424 --> 07:14.090
May I offer you a beverage?

07:14.092 --> 07:16.926
Perhaps an organic cucumber
vodka spritzer? Yes.

07:16.928 --> 07:20.630
It is so beautiful. I feel
like I'm inside Cate Blanchett.

07:20.632 --> 07:22.031
We get that a lot.

07:22.033 --> 07:23.566
I've got to say,
I'm pretty impressed

07:23.568 --> 07:26.302
with how quickly you guys
came to that decision.

07:26.304 --> 07:28.471
Well, that's 'cause you
don't know how mature we are.

07:28.473 --> 07:31.741
You see, Winston had dibs on Cindy
De La Garza since the fifth grade,

07:31.743 --> 07:33.710
I Frenched her in the
eighth grade, so...

07:33.712 --> 07:37.280
So about 20 years ago Winston
had a three-year-old dib,

07:37.282 --> 07:40.383
he never acted on it,
and now you're the bad guy?

07:40.385 --> 07:42.886
(laughs):
Oh, Reagan.

07:42.888 --> 07:45.388
First of all, dibs
can't be singular...

07:45.390 --> 07:47.123
I mean, if anything,
it's kind of a story

07:47.125 --> 07:48.892
about how indecisive
Winston can be.

07:48.894 --> 07:50.727
Well, no, it's a story about...
But you guys

07:50.729 --> 07:52.228
came to a decision--
I'm proud of you.

07:52.230 --> 07:56.132
Uh, can I... can I practice
my presentation on you?

07:56.134 --> 07:58.168
Sure. But I'm bored already.
Okay.

07:58.170 --> 08:00.170
This stuff's really
boring for me.

08:00.172 --> 08:02.438
For everybody, I guess.
Hmm.

08:02.440 --> 08:05.775
Hepatitis C can be a long...

08:05.777 --> 08:07.510
arduous experience.

08:07.512 --> 08:08.945
But now

08:08.947 --> 08:11.681
discover Zilpoza
from Wudai Pharmaceuticals.

08:11.683 --> 08:13.249
FDA approval...

08:13.251 --> 08:15.752
pending double-blind study.

08:15.754 --> 08:17.587
If you've had cirrhosis

08:17.589 --> 08:19.489
or kidney disease,

08:19.491 --> 08:21.024
Zilpoza...

08:21.026 --> 08:22.859
may not...

08:22.861 --> 08:24.627
be right...

08:24.629 --> 08:26.863
(whispers):
for... you.

08:28.099 --> 08:30.099
(laughing)

08:30.101 --> 08:32.702
You think I'm a
13-year-old boy?

08:32.704 --> 08:34.537
I know what you're doing.

08:34.539 --> 08:35.872
What am... what am I doing?
You're trying

08:35.874 --> 08:37.640
to lead me on, and
I won't have it.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.175
Case closed!
You're having Winston!

08:39.177 --> 08:40.376
Great, I'm having Winston.

08:40.378 --> 08:42.445
Uh...

08:44.783 --> 08:46.850
Mm.

08:48.486 --> 08:49.953
(exhales)

08:52.824 --> 08:54.557
It's so juvenile,
what you're doing.

08:54.559 --> 08:57.627
A dib is a dib.

08:59.664 --> 09:01.998
Oh, God, if I keep looking at
the ceiling, I'm gonna cry.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.133
Damn it, we are getting sucked
in-- we have to leave immediately.

09:04.135 --> 09:05.902
It's probably not
even available.

09:05.904 --> 09:07.670
There's no way, right? I mean...
You're right.

09:07.672 --> 09:08.905
(chuckles)
Philip.

09:08.907 --> 09:10.373
Hmm?
Quick question.

09:10.375 --> 09:12.308
Look, we realize
that you guys book up

09:12.310 --> 09:14.377
decades in advance,
so please just let us know

09:14.379 --> 09:16.246
that you don't have any
slots available. Actually,

09:16.248 --> 09:18.248
you're in luck--
Shia LaBeouf had to cancel

09:18.250 --> 09:19.816
his solitaire tournament,

09:19.818 --> 09:22.418
and we have one open slot,
in April.

09:22.420 --> 09:24.220
(quiet groan)
In April?

09:24.222 --> 09:26.155
Mm-hmm. All right, babe, no.
No, no, no,

09:26.157 --> 09:27.523
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

09:27.525 --> 09:28.992
You need to breathe.
We're just gonna enact

09:28.994 --> 09:31.160
the plan that we set up
for when you see an ankle boot

09:31.162 --> 09:32.262
you really, really,
really like, right?

09:32.264 --> 09:33.563
What do we do?
We walk away...

09:33.565 --> 09:34.831
And if I dream about it
in the middle

09:34.833 --> 09:35.899
of the night,
then it's meant to be.

09:35.901 --> 09:36.900
We're gonna walk away, Philip.

09:36.902 --> 09:38.167
Thank you so much
for all your help.

09:38.169 --> 09:39.168
I should let
you know,

09:39.170 --> 09:40.403
however, there is

09:40.405 --> 09:42.171
another interested party.

09:42.173 --> 09:46.276
BENJAMIN (laughs):
What? Schmittyballs?

09:46.278 --> 09:48.544
B... B-Benjamin.

09:48.546 --> 09:49.746
Okay.

09:49.748 --> 09:51.080
SCHMIDT: You're engaged?  Hmm.

09:51.082 --> 09:52.782
Mazel to you, sir.
Hey, Meems,

09:52.784 --> 09:54.417
this is the, uh,
fat guy from school

09:54.419 --> 09:55.885
we used to make dance
for chocolate.

09:55.887 --> 09:56.953
MIMI: Oh.
SCHMIDT: In all fairness,

09:56.955 --> 09:58.254
uh, Benjamin would

09:58.256 --> 09:59.856
peg chocolate at my head

09:59.858 --> 10:01.424
while I was already dancing.

10:01.426 --> 10:02.525
He what?
Benny-boo,

10:02.527 --> 10:03.760
I don't want to lose

10:03.762 --> 10:04.794
The Lisbon to
these fat people.

10:04.796 --> 10:06.429
The hell?
Don't worry,

10:06.431 --> 10:07.897
Schmidtstain can't afford
The Lisbon.

10:07.899 --> 10:09.299
Oh. Unless, of
course, they accept

10:09.301 --> 10:10.733
gift certificates from fat camp.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.902
Benjamin, I still...
I mean... I can...

10:12.904 --> 10:15.138
Do they do that?
I'm a different...

10:15.140 --> 10:16.205
We'll have to ask somebody
about that.

10:16.207 --> 10:17.640
Okay, that is it!

10:17.642 --> 10:20.576
We... are booking The Lisbon.
We are?

10:20.578 --> 10:21.644
Go!
No.

10:21.646 --> 10:23.112
I've never loved you more, Cece!

10:27.752 --> 10:29.786
What were you gonna say?

10:29.788 --> 10:32.088
What is that
in reference to?

10:32.090 --> 10:34.257
It's been silent
for 30 minutes.

10:34.259 --> 10:36.159
Earlier, you were gonna tell me
what my best feature was,

10:36.161 --> 10:37.460
and then we got distracted.

10:37.462 --> 10:39.429
Right. By<i> crime. </i>
I could tell you

10:39.431 --> 10:40.997
what yours is.
Oh, my God, please don't.

10:40.999 --> 10:43.066
You have a lovely neck.
Really?

10:43.068 --> 10:46.502
Mm-hmm. Not my knuckles or,
like, the skin behind my ears?

10:46.504 --> 10:48.071
Okay, do me.
It's my turn.

10:48.073 --> 10:49.639
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, I need this. Fine.

10:49.641 --> 10:51.140
I will tell you,

10:51.142 --> 10:53.609
but then we drop it
immediately and forever.

10:53.611 --> 10:54.844
Drop.

10:54.846 --> 10:56.579
You have kind eyes.

10:56.581 --> 10:57.780
Really?

10:57.782 --> 10:59.048
Mm-hmm.

11:00.251 --> 11:02.318
I have kind eyes.

11:03.655 --> 11:05.655
I'll take that.

11:05.657 --> 11:08.958
You know, I always thought
I had snail eyes.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.626
"Immediately and forever,"
remember?

11:10.628 --> 11:11.995
I'll turn around.

11:11.997 --> 11:13.363
Turn around.

11:13.365 --> 11:14.998
I-I'll save my
kind eyes for last.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.432
Okay.

11:17.602 --> 11:20.136
(phone buzzing)

11:20.138 --> 11:21.637
Hello?

11:21.639 --> 11:22.839
I'm reopening
the Reagan decision.

11:22.841 --> 11:24.173
Wait, what?

11:24.175 --> 11:25.675
(quietly):
I already took my supplements.

11:25.677 --> 11:26.976
I know. I'm sorry.
I'm telling her

11:26.978 --> 11:28.311
we've decided, and it was me.

11:28.313 --> 11:30.346
Oh, no, you are not!
I hear shaving.

11:30.348 --> 11:31.447
Are you shaving?
No!

11:31.449 --> 11:33.116
I know what that means.

11:33.118 --> 11:35.051
(phone beeps)
Hello? Hello, Nick?

11:35.987 --> 11:37.987
(whispers):
Damn.

11:37.989 --> 11:40.323
Just go.

11:40.325 --> 11:42.692
You mean it?

11:42.694 --> 11:45.028
Thank you very
much, Aly.

11:45.030 --> 11:48.765
I am going to<i> win </i>
this sex bet!

11:54.072 --> 11:55.104
(elevator bell chimes)

11:59.677 --> 12:01.010
We want to get married
at The Lisbon.

12:01.012 --> 12:02.745
We want to book
The Lisbon right now!

12:02.747 --> 12:04.747
Uh, start by filling
these forms out.

12:04.749 --> 12:05.882
It'll be pleasure.
Yeah, no problem.

12:05.884 --> 12:07.150
CECE:
What's our routing number?

12:07.152 --> 12:08.985
69364278.
Just gonna give Benjamin

12:08.987 --> 12:11.487
a little coffee-- oh, I'm so sorry.
Hey, come on,

12:11.489 --> 12:13.589
she can't do that. No, no, she did that.
I'm so sorry.

12:13.591 --> 12:15.024
Yeah.
Oh, wow.

12:15.026 --> 12:16.592
The service is so gorgeous.

12:16.594 --> 12:18.194
Really great.
You do realize

12:18.196 --> 12:20.329
we're not gonna decide this
on who writes the fastest.

12:20.331 --> 12:21.330
You know,

12:21.332 --> 12:22.932
here at The Lisbon,

12:22.934 --> 12:24.534
we celebrate grandeur, and romance.
Oh, you are

12:24.536 --> 12:26.169
Schmidt out of
luck, Schmidt.

12:26.171 --> 12:28.037
Our wedding's gonna be
<i> sick</i> romantic.

12:28.039 --> 12:29.839
Our wedding's gonna be
<i>way</i> romantic, bro.

12:29.841 --> 12:31.908
Quiches so small you got
to wear glasses.  Bitch,

12:31.910 --> 12:33.109
we're gonna have
more white linen

12:33.111 --> 12:34.444
than a hospital
in the Great War.

12:34.446 --> 12:35.378
Yeah, we're gonna
have so many

12:35.380 --> 12:37.046
fresh cut flowers

12:37.048 --> 12:38.948
that you're gonna have
a real<i> bee</i> problem

12:38.950 --> 12:40.683
up in this<i> bitch. </i>
We're gonna have

12:40.685 --> 12:42.552
spanakopita so flaky,
you're gonna get crumbs

12:42.554 --> 12:44.687
all over your mouth, like,<i> what?
</i> Our tables

12:44.689 --> 12:47.123
are gonna be names of cities
that we've been to, like,<i> what?</i>

12:47.125 --> 12:50.560
our wedding is gonna
be so... big...

12:50.562 --> 12:53.062
that the Giants
will come to town

12:53.064 --> 12:56.365
and everyone gets
a big spoon.

12:58.203 --> 12:59.702
Philip, you-you want romance?

12:59.704 --> 13:00.870
Let me tell you
the story about

13:00.872 --> 13:03.039
how I knew that Mimi
was the one for me.

13:03.041 --> 13:05.608
The story is called "Lovestruck."
SCHMIDT: There's a title?

13:05.610 --> 13:08.211
It was our fourth date,
and we had just seen<i> Toy Story 3</i>

13:08.213 --> 13:11.881
for the second time. Maybe it's
just us, but we love Pixar.

13:11.883 --> 13:13.149
BENJAMIN: We're nerds.
(Mimi giggles)

13:13.151 --> 13:14.217
I reach

13:14.219 --> 13:15.284
for Mimi's hand,

13:15.286 --> 13:16.953
and I was struck by lightning.

13:16.955 --> 13:18.754
I mean, literally,

13:18.756 --> 13:21.390
Yeah. Zap. I was struck by a
bolt of lightning, Philip,

13:21.392 --> 13:22.925
and I...
I would've been killed

13:22.927 --> 13:24.727
if Mimi hadn't grounded me.

13:24.729 --> 13:26.629
We met... crying
(chuckles)

13:26.631 --> 13:27.763
over the same name

13:27.765 --> 13:29.565
at the Vietnam Memorial.

13:29.567 --> 13:30.833
George...

13:30.835 --> 13:32.735
Harrison...

13:32.737 --> 13:34.103
Ford.

13:34.105 --> 13:35.471
Wha...?

13:35.473 --> 13:37.807
Who was our grandfather.

13:37.809 --> 13:39.075
SCHMIDT:
What? Making us cousins?

13:39.077 --> 13:42.178
Making us cousins,
because there is

13:42.180 --> 13:43.779
nothing more romantic

13:43.781 --> 13:45.515
than forbidden love.

13:45.517 --> 13:47.250
Between family members?
I mean, that's...

13:47.252 --> 13:49.085
You're gonna double down
with that?

13:49.087 --> 13:51.154
Yes, I am.
He's writing "cousins" down.

13:51.156 --> 13:52.855
CECE: That's a
positive thing.

13:52.857 --> 13:54.090
No, it's not.

13:54.092 --> 13:55.358
Hey. What are
you doing, man?

13:55.360 --> 13:56.926
We had a decision.
The decision

13:56.928 --> 13:58.928
wasn't valid--
your dib on Cindy

13:58.930 --> 14:00.596
was expired.
Okay, first of all

14:00.598 --> 14:01.931
dibs don't expire.

14:01.933 --> 14:03.866
Also, dibs-- not singular.

14:03.868 --> 14:05.801
And how are you
still shaving?

14:05.803 --> 14:07.136
I'm doing
full body, Winston.

14:07.138 --> 14:09.138
I started from the bottom,
now I'm here.

14:09.140 --> 14:11.040
That's gross. I've been
doing sex prep all day.

14:11.042 --> 14:12.942
I did a hundred
girl push-ups.

14:12.944 --> 14:15.511
I washed my feet
until the water ran clear.

14:15.513 --> 14:18.047
You can clean your feet all
damn day-- it don't matter,

14:18.049 --> 14:19.849
because I'm having sex
with Reagan tonight.

14:19.851 --> 14:21.617
The decision's been made.
Well, the decision's

14:21.619 --> 14:23.186
been changed-- I'm
having sex with Reagan.

14:23.188 --> 14:24.353
That's not gonna happen.
It is gonna happen.

14:24.355 --> 14:25.154
Now, if you'll
excuse me...

14:25.156 --> 14:26.489
No, don't...
Got it!

14:26.491 --> 14:28.124
What were you going for?
The cologne.

14:28.126 --> 14:30.159
I smell so pretty! Give me...
give me my col...

14:30.161 --> 14:32.228
(grunts)
No. No, no, no. No.

14:32.230 --> 14:33.329
(spitting)

14:33.331 --> 14:35.464
Oh, God! Aah!

14:35.466 --> 14:38.501
(grunts) What are you doing!
Aah! I don't know, man!

14:38.503 --> 14:39.835
You got frickin' cologne
all over me.

14:39.837 --> 14:41.404
I smell fantastic!

14:41.406 --> 14:43.806
Oh, my God. We got to
turn the tables on Reagan,

14:43.808 --> 14:45.208
make<i> her</i> decide.
I don't see her

14:45.210 --> 14:47.076
going for it, man--
the entire point

14:47.078 --> 14:49.011
was that<i> we</i> had
to make a decision.

14:49.013 --> 14:50.379
Well, then I guess
we're gonna have

14:50.381 --> 14:52.815
to trick her, and I know how.

14:52.817 --> 14:54.050
We'll up your fee
by $10,000.

14:54.052 --> 14:55.751
Ten thousand
and one dollar!

14:55.753 --> 14:58.254
Uh, Cece, we don't have $10,000.
We barely have the one.

14:58.256 --> 15:01.257
Ten thousand and<i> two</i> dollars!
It's not your turn to bid.

15:01.259 --> 15:02.925
$15,000!
$15,000...

15:02.927 --> 15:04.393
It's not... it's not...
it's not worth it.

15:04.395 --> 15:05.928
It's not worth it.
Yeah, but it's your dream.

15:05.930 --> 15:09.332
I... I know.

15:09.334 --> 15:11.200
But I already have my dream.

15:11.202 --> 15:12.902
It's marrying you.

15:16.407 --> 15:19.008
It's all yours, Benjamin.

15:19.010 --> 15:20.910
Yes!
(giggles)

15:20.912 --> 15:22.411
BENJAMIN:
"I have my dream."

15:22.413 --> 15:23.412
Dumb!

15:23.414 --> 15:24.914
MIMI:
They remind me of my

15:24.916 --> 15:27.383
stupid grandparents on
their 60th anniversary.

15:27.385 --> 15:29.185
(laughs)
Old.

15:29.187 --> 15:31.087
(murmuring)

15:31.089 --> 15:33.356
Reagan. Let me guess. You
guys made a final decision?

15:33.358 --> 15:35.891
Please. Sit.

15:35.893 --> 15:37.627
That's probably the first time
you've been right all day,

15:37.629 --> 15:39.629
but yes, we have
made a decision.

15:39.631 --> 15:41.364
Great. WINSTON: Here's
the deal, Reagan.

15:41.366 --> 15:42.765
It's 2016, you're a lady.

15:42.767 --> 15:44.967
Your decision
is important to us.

15:44.969 --> 15:46.636
Yes, we want you to decide

15:46.638 --> 15:49.238
which one of us
is most attractive to you,

15:49.240 --> 15:51.474
and if that person
is the same name

15:51.476 --> 15:54.110
that's on the piece of paper
in this envelope,

15:54.112 --> 15:56.245
then sexual relations
can commence.

15:56.247 --> 15:57.880
Okay, well, the
logic is bulletproof.

15:57.882 --> 15:59.882
I just feel like if I'm gonna
be making this decision,

15:59.884 --> 16:01.717
I need you guys
to pitch yourselves.

16:01.719 --> 16:03.753
For starters,
I'm completely hairless,

16:03.755 --> 16:06.389
Okay. except for a straggler
near one of my nipples,

16:06.391 --> 16:07.790
because I got scared
while shaving.

16:07.792 --> 16:09.825
In my fantasies,
I'm a wild lover.

16:09.827 --> 16:12.395
In real life, my sexual prowess
has been described

16:12.397 --> 16:14.297
as "fine," "adequate."

16:14.299 --> 16:16.098
"It'll get the job done."

16:16.100 --> 16:17.767
That is both a
lot and a little,

16:17.769 --> 16:19.435
but either way,
a tough act to follow.

16:19.437 --> 16:21.504
Winston, you're up.
Well, that's easy.

16:21.506 --> 16:24.106
I've got kind eyes.
NICK: You don't

16:24.108 --> 16:26.175
have kind eyes. You have snail
eyes. Everybody knows that.

16:26.177 --> 16:28.744
I've got kind eyes. Aly told me so.
Who's Aly?

16:28.746 --> 16:30.780
Yeah, she's my partner at work.
I complimented her first,

16:30.782 --> 16:33.149
told her she had a very nice
neck, which she does.

16:33.151 --> 16:34.984
But what I should have said was,

16:34.986 --> 16:37.953
"You got a really cool chin," or
"You got some dope earlobes."

16:37.955 --> 16:39.955
Honestly,
everything about her is great.

16:39.957 --> 16:44.093
And when I'm with her,
I never really notice time.

16:44.095 --> 16:46.529
It's probably because
she is the best part of my day.

16:46.531 --> 16:49.031
I should... I should have
told her one of those things,

16:49.033 --> 16:50.933
as opposed to the neck thing,
you know.

16:50.935 --> 16:52.335
Then she told me
I had kind eyes.

16:52.337 --> 16:54.470
You like Aly.
Yes.

16:54.472 --> 16:56.605
She's my partner.
NICK:  Winston!

16:56.607 --> 16:58.407
Come on, it's obvious.
You like Aly.

17:01.279 --> 17:03.713
I-I like her.
I-I like Aly.

17:04.649 --> 17:06.716
Oh, my goodness!

17:06.718 --> 17:08.517
Why did I never
think of that before?

17:08.519 --> 17:09.952
Wow, my mouth is dry.

17:09.954 --> 17:11.320
Anybody else's mouth dry?

17:11.322 --> 17:13.489
What should I do?
I don't know what to do.

17:13.491 --> 17:14.824
I don't know what to do.
What should I do?  Winston,

17:14.826 --> 17:16.859
this is Cindy De La Garza
all over again.

17:16.861 --> 17:18.661
You need to make a decision.

17:18.663 --> 17:21.030
I got to ask her out.

17:21.032 --> 17:22.398
Good! Go! Go ahead!
Go!  Good luck!

17:24.135 --> 17:26.202
NICK:
Yes.

17:26.204 --> 17:29.138
Listen, Reagan,
I am so sorry,

17:29.140 --> 17:32.675
but obviously, we will not
be making love tonight.

17:32.677 --> 17:35.177
No. It's not fair.
I'm sorry.

17:35.179 --> 17:36.479
I got to go.

17:36.481 --> 17:38.147
Well, I guess that leaves

17:38.149 --> 17:40.182
just old Nick Miller.

17:40.184 --> 17:43.352
Mm. Your room or my room?

17:43.354 --> 17:44.653
Hmm?

17:48.726 --> 17:51.660
Well, both rooms have a lot
of interesting possibilities.

17:51.662 --> 17:53.496
Mm-hmm.

17:53.498 --> 17:56.065
That's a heck
of a question.

17:56.067 --> 17:58.000
Your, um...

17:58.002 --> 18:00.236
Give me 15 minutes,
and I'm gonna come back

18:00.238 --> 18:02.505
and tell you which room
and why from my opinion,

18:02.507 --> 18:05.040
and then, you can give me yours,
and we can discuss.

18:05.042 --> 18:07.343
Just give me one second,
and, uh, I'll be good to go.

18:07.345 --> 18:10.179
I just need...
two minutes tops.

18:10.181 --> 18:12.415
You stay there.

18:19.857 --> 18:21.924
(grunts)

18:23.194 --> 18:26.595
Oh.
Oh! Aw, no!

18:26.597 --> 18:28.564
Oh, that's a
lot of blood.

18:28.566 --> 18:30.566
Oh.

18:30.568 --> 18:32.401
Damn.

18:32.403 --> 18:35.404
(sighs)

18:35.406 --> 18:38.908
Well, you're back, and you have
an insane look in your eyes,

18:38.910 --> 18:41.043
so... congratulations?
No, I didn't do it.

18:41.045 --> 18:43.546
I was, uh... You know,
I thought about it.

18:43.548 --> 18:45.481
Oh, I don't need to know.

18:45.483 --> 18:47.249
Uh, yeah.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.318
Yeah...

18:56.961 --> 19:00.262
Would you like to go out after
work, grab a drink with me?

19:00.264 --> 19:02.465
Sure.

19:02.467 --> 19:05.100
Sure. (laughs)

19:05.102 --> 19:07.369
All right then. (laughs)

19:10.508 --> 19:13.008
Oh. Uh, can my boyfriend come?

19:15.780 --> 19:17.112
Your boyfriend? Yeah.

19:17.114 --> 19:18.848
Yeah, sure!
(clears throat)

19:18.850 --> 19:20.416
How long have you guys been...?
Yeah, it's new.

19:20.418 --> 19:21.917
It's new. It's new. It's...

19:21.919 --> 19:26.689
He's an agent, actually,
for... animal actors?

19:26.691 --> 19:28.424
What am I gonna say? No.

19:28.426 --> 19:32.628
He should stay at home
and not exist, please.

19:32.630 --> 19:34.163
(laughs)
No, I won't say that.

19:34.165 --> 19:37.399
Officer down... to
meet your boyfriend.

19:38.169 --> 19:39.535
I realize those were

19:39.537 --> 19:42.304
a poor choice of words
for a station.

19:42.306 --> 19:43.305
REAGAN:
<i> Nick!</i>

19:43.307 --> 19:44.306
It's almost 9:00.

19:44.308 --> 19:45.708
Are we doing this or what?

19:47.512 --> 19:49.278
What is that?

19:49.280 --> 19:52.281
You look like you're in
a Boca Raton street gang.

19:52.283 --> 19:54.683
I didn't think you were actually
gonna go through with it,

19:54.685 --> 19:56.819
and even if you were...

19:56.821 --> 19:59.221
<i> I</i> made a decision.

19:59.223 --> 20:01.991
I wouldn't want it like this.

20:01.993 --> 20:03.826
So I decided

20:03.828 --> 20:06.962
to put on my I'm-not-having-sex
tonight outfit,

20:06.964 --> 20:10.332
'cause no one's gonna have sex
with me in this outfit.

20:10.334 --> 20:11.700
And now I'm
gonna go out

20:11.702 --> 20:13.168
and have a drink.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.803
Would you like to come?

20:14.805 --> 20:18.374
Wow. Deciding Nick.

20:19.844 --> 20:22.244
Let me change.

20:24.482 --> 20:26.181
NICK:
<i> FYI-- your</i>

20:26.183 --> 20:27.883
I'm-not-having-sex-tonight
outfit

20:27.885 --> 20:30.252
is leopard print and tight.

20:30.254 --> 20:32.721
I don't know if you know that. It's
animal print, but it's not tight.

20:32.723 --> 20:35.925
These are baggy, fuzzy PJs
with a flap on the butt.

20:35.927 --> 20:38.928
Exactly my point. You want
to see what's in the envelope?

20:38.930 --> 20:41.697
It's a blank piece of paper.
You're so wrong.

20:41.699 --> 20:45.234
Does that look
like a blank sheet of paper?

20:45.236 --> 20:47.536
Very clever. Thanks, yeah.
I thought of it

20:47.538 --> 20:49.038
when I was getting tickets
to the World Series of Chili

20:49.040 --> 20:50.439
and had to prove
that I was human.

20:50.441 --> 20:52.374
Ooh... hoo.

20:52.376 --> 20:53.742
We've got big news,
you guys.

20:53.744 --> 20:55.177
Champagne all around.

20:55.179 --> 20:56.946
We're getting
married in a...

20:56.948 --> 20:58.747
BOTH:
soon-to-be-abandoned warehouse!

20:58.749 --> 21:00.950
Yeah. Champagne.

21:00.952 --> 21:03.252
Oh, thank you. And
I'll even give you one.

21:03.254 --> 21:06.055
Hey, guys, Aly is
on her way to the bar.

21:06.057 --> 21:08.123
(cheering)
With her boyfriend.

21:08.125 --> 21:10.392
Oh, that's the worst. Well, you know,
everyone dies. Maybe he'll die.

21:10.394 --> 21:11.560
I'm sorry, Winston.

21:11.562 --> 21:12.962
Is there anything we can do
to cheer you up?

21:12.964 --> 21:14.897
Uh, no. Anything that would
make you feel better?

21:14.899 --> 21:16.098
Anything?
Anything?

21:16.100 --> 21:18.133
Well, if you insist, then.

21:18.135 --> 21:20.235
You asked me what I wanted.
This is all want.

21:20.237 --> 21:21.403
All right, let's do it,
let's do it. Let's just do it.

21:21.405 --> 21:22.404
Let's do it.
Okay, let's go.
