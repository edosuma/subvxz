Mom, what are you doing?

01:28.964 --> 01:30.131
For crying out loud,

01:28.964 --> 01:30.131
Malcolm,

01:30.173 --> 01:33.134
why am I paying for underpants

01:30.173 --> 01:33.134
that you're not wearing?

01:33.176 --> 01:34.135
Mom.

01:34.177 --> 01:37.014
Why are you not wearing

01:34.177 --> 01:37.014
your underpants?

01:37.056 --> 01:38.933
I want to wear boxers.

01:38.974 --> 01:39.934
Oh, really?

01:39.975 --> 01:40.935
Well, you may think

01:40.976 --> 01:42.519
you suddenly need

01:40.976 --> 01:42.519
all the extra room,

01:42.561 --> 01:43.938
but let me tell you, my dear,

01:43.979 --> 01:46.356
you are getting

01:43.979 --> 01:46.356
way ahead of yourself.

01:48.734 --> 01:53.781
Just once, I'd like a childhood

01:48.734 --> 01:53.781
memory I don't have to repress.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.663
Do you think maybe Dewey's

02:01.705 --> 02:03.958
getting a little old

02:01.705 --> 02:03.958
for stuffed animals?

02:06.919 --> 02:11.090
Maybe we should start thinking

02:06.919 --> 02:11.090
about weaning him off Domingo.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.634
I guess that part of

02:11.131 --> 02:13.634
his childhood is over.

02:13.675 --> 02:16.095
So sad.

02:16.136 --> 02:18.138
Our little baby is growing up.

02:18.179 --> 02:20.140
Give me that.

02:22.101 --> 02:23.310
Hey,

02:23.351 --> 02:25.646
check out the new kid.

02:25.687 --> 02:28.774
STEVIE:

02:25.687 --> 02:28.774
Fresh...

02:28.816 --> 02:30.150
meat.

02:30.191 --> 02:32.527
You no longer have

02:30.191 --> 02:32.527
to live in fear.

02:32.569 --> 02:34.362
What are you talking about?

02:34.404 --> 02:37.198
The hazing we put you through

02:34.404 --> 02:37.198
is over.

02:37.240 --> 02:38.199
What hazing?

02:38.241 --> 02:39.200
Oh, come on.

02:39.242 --> 02:41.996
When we gave you the

02:39.242 --> 02:41.996
warped lunch tray?

02:43.246 --> 02:45.206
When we dulled the

02:43.246 --> 02:45.206
points on your pencils?

02:46.500 --> 02:49.168
When you sneezed and no

02:46.500 --> 02:49.168
one said "Bless you"?

02:49.210 --> 02:51.170
I still feel bad

02:49.210 --> 02:51.170
about that.

02:51.212 --> 02:54.173
Now she's taking your

02:51.212 --> 02:54.173
place as the whipping boy.

02:54.215 --> 02:55.801
You know, you guys

02:54.215 --> 02:55.801
get dumped on and tortured

02:55.843 --> 02:57.218
by the entire school.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.554
Why would you want

02:57.260 --> 02:59.554
to do it to someone else?

02:59.596 --> 03:01.222
(mumbles "I don't know")

03:01.264 --> 03:03.433
You guys don't even know

03:01.264 --> 03:03.433
this girl. Maybe she's nice.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.228
Hi.

03:07.270 --> 03:08.271
I'm Malcolm.

03:08.313 --> 03:09.523
Cynthia.

03:09.564 --> 03:11.232
So, you're new here.

03:11.274 --> 03:14.820
Yeah... my dad wanted

03:11.274 --> 03:14.820
to get away from Manhattan,

03:14.862 --> 03:16.279
but I think the real reason is

03:16.321 --> 03:18.115
that my mom's remarriage

03:16.321 --> 03:18.115
hit him pretty hard

03:18.157 --> 03:20.241
and he thinks that a new

03:18.157 --> 03:20.241
environment would help.

03:20.283 --> 03:21.994
The truth is,

03:20.283 --> 03:21.994
nothing's been the same

03:22.036 --> 03:24.746
since my brother died

03:22.036 --> 03:24.746
in the boating accident.

03:26.289 --> 03:28.959
(laughing):

03:26.289 --> 03:28.959
Just kidding.

03:29.001 --> 03:30.377
What?

03:30.418 --> 03:33.588
Get... a room.

03:33.630 --> 03:34.965
(laughing)

03:35.007 --> 03:37.134
Anyway, I'll see you later

03:37.176 --> 03:39.761
and I'm glad

03:37.176 --> 03:39.761
your brother's okay.

03:39.803 --> 03:41.680
I don't have a brother.

04:02.325 --> 04:08.040
Cadets, apparently

04:02.325 --> 04:08.040
one of you felt the

04:02.325 --> 04:08.040
compelling need

04:08.082 --> 04:14.295
to take my '37 Stutz Bearcat

04:08.082 --> 04:14.295
for a joyride in a cornfield.

04:14.337 --> 04:17.424
You may be sure the

04:14.337 --> 04:17.424
responsible party

04:17.465 --> 04:20.052
will be disciplined.

04:20.094 --> 04:21.302
Now, I know

04:21.344 --> 04:25.432
in the past I have resorted

04:21.344 --> 04:25.432
to grueling midnight hikes

04:25.473 --> 04:27.684
through leech-

04:25.473 --> 04:27.684
infested swamps

04:27.726 --> 04:31.312
or the repetitive digging

04:27.726 --> 04:31.312
and filling of ditches,

04:31.354 --> 04:32.647
et cetera, et cetera.

04:32.689 --> 04:35.400
But things have changed.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.652
Due to a recent

04:35.442 --> 04:37.652
court decision

04:37.694 --> 04:41.031
involving corporal punishment,

04:41.073 --> 04:46.954
a loophole has allowed me

04:41.073 --> 04:46.954
to unretire "Old Hickory."

04:50.373 --> 04:52.500
(whooshing)

04:56.546 --> 05:00.592
Mmm. He hungers for the sting

05:00.634 --> 05:03.053
of insolent flesh.

05:03.095 --> 05:04.096
(buzzing)

05:08.142 --> 05:09.101
Hi, Dad.

05:09.143 --> 05:10.477
Oh, hey, son. What's up?

05:10.518 --> 05:12.520
I need a little favor.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.439
Oh, I'll try.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.439
What do you need?

05:14.481 --> 05:16.733
An alibi. If anyone asks,

05:14.481 --> 05:16.733
you just have to say

05:16.775 --> 05:18.902
we were on a father-son

05:16.775 --> 05:18.902
fishing trip yesterday.

05:18.944 --> 05:19.903
What did you do?

05:19.945 --> 05:20.904
Really, Dad,

05:20.946 --> 05:22.114
do the specifics matter?

05:22.156 --> 05:23.907
I mean,

05:22.156 --> 05:23.907
you have to do this for me.

05:23.949 --> 05:25.533
I am not going to lie for you.

05:25.575 --> 05:28.162
Okay, I'm calling in my chit.

05:28.203 --> 05:30.497
What chit?

05:28.203 --> 05:30.497
You know, the one-time thing.

05:30.538 --> 05:32.499
I just call it in and you do it,

05:30.538 --> 05:32.499
no questions asked.

05:32.540 --> 05:35.418
That doesn't exist, Francis.

05:32.540 --> 05:35.418
Dad.

05:35.460 --> 05:36.920
No, I'm sorry, son,

05:35.460 --> 05:36.920
I can't help you.

05:36.962 --> 05:38.505
You're gonna have

05:36.962 --> 05:38.505
to face the consequences

05:38.546 --> 05:39.923
of your actions like a grown-up.

05:39.965 --> 05:44.136
All I have to say is,

05:39.965 --> 05:44.136
I am very disappointed in you.

05:44.178 --> 05:45.386
Was that Francis?

05:45.428 --> 05:46.554
How's he doing?

05:46.596 --> 05:48.140
Good. He... he, uh...

05:48.182 --> 05:50.558
just got a "B"

05:48.182 --> 05:50.558
on his history final.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.102
Good for him.

05:52.144 --> 05:53.394
You know, this is

05:52.144 --> 05:53.394
the longest he's ever gone

05:53.436 --> 05:54.980
without getting

05:53.436 --> 05:54.980
into any kind of trouble.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.107
Maybe things are finally

05:55.022 --> 05:57.107
starting to turn around.

06:07.201 --> 06:10.912
So, why are you

06:07.201 --> 06:10.912
here so late?

06:10.954 --> 06:13.332
I had to use

06:10.954 --> 06:13.332
the school computer.

06:13.372 --> 06:15.083
Why are you here so late?

06:15.125 --> 06:16.543
I really liked what

06:15.125 --> 06:16.543
you said in class

06:16.584 --> 06:18.920
about the search for

06:16.584 --> 06:18.920
intelligent life in

06:16.584 --> 06:18.920
the universe.

06:18.962 --> 06:20.505
And you waited out here

06:18.962 --> 06:20.505
to tell me that?

06:20.547 --> 06:21.715
You know, I was thinking,

06:21.756 --> 06:22.966
why are we

06:21.756 --> 06:22.966
even bothering

06:23.008 --> 06:24.551
to send signals

06:23.008 --> 06:24.551
into deep space?

06:24.592 --> 06:26.970
If we do make contact

06:24.592 --> 06:26.970
with extraterrestrials,

06:27.012 --> 06:29.014
we'll probably just wind

06:27.012 --> 06:29.014
up doing their laundry.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.307
(laughs)

06:30.349 --> 06:31.350
Just kidding.

06:31.390 --> 06:34.102
So, what's it like

06:31.390 --> 06:34.102
having a brother?

06:34.144 --> 06:35.145
I don't know.

06:35.187 --> 06:37.689
Well, I've got

06:35.187 --> 06:37.689
to go home now. Bye.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.274
Bye.

06:54.248 --> 06:55.749
What's going on?

06:55.790 --> 06:57.709
Some weird new girl from school

06:57.751 --> 06:59.460
actually followed me home.

06:59.502 --> 07:00.837
Really? Is she cute?

07:00.879 --> 07:03.715
Hey, is this what that whole

07:00.879 --> 07:03.715
boxer shorts thing is all about?

07:03.757 --> 07:06.425
Mom, please don't.

07:08.469 --> 07:09.846
Hi.

07:11.390 --> 07:12.473
Thank you again for inviting me.

07:12.515 --> 07:13.558
LOIS:

07:12.515 --> 07:13.558
Oh, you're welcome.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.726
If my son weren't such

07:14.768 --> 07:16.270
an unforgivably rude little pig,

07:16.311 --> 07:18.021
he would have

07:16.311 --> 07:18.021
invited you himself.

07:18.063 --> 07:20.023
You be nicer to her.

07:20.065 --> 07:21.566
She obviously has

07:20.065 --> 07:21.566
no friends at all.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.193
Malcolm, would you

07:21.608 --> 07:23.193
ask your girlfriend

07:23.235 --> 07:24.236
to pass the potatoes?

07:25.612 --> 07:29.616
Malcolm, would you thank

07:25.612 --> 07:29.616
your girlfriend for me?

07:30.784 --> 07:33.494
So, Cynthia,

07:30.784 --> 07:33.494
you're in Malcolm's class.

07:33.536 --> 07:34.413
Yeah.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.292
Huh.

07:38.333 --> 07:40.752
Malcolm, would you

07:38.333 --> 07:40.752
ask your girlfriend

07:40.794 --> 07:42.003
if she would

07:40.794 --> 07:42.003
like some peas?

07:42.045 --> 07:43.588
We get it.

07:43.630 --> 07:47.008
Thank you, Mr. Chicken,

07:43.630 --> 07:47.008
for giving up your life

07:47.050 --> 07:48.802
so that I can

07:47.050 --> 07:48.802
continue to live.

07:48.843 --> 07:50.304
What are you doing?

07:50.345 --> 07:52.097
I know if someone

07:50.345 --> 07:52.097
killed me and ate me,

07:52.139 --> 07:54.015
I'd like them to at

07:52.139 --> 07:54.015
least say thank you.

07:54.057 --> 07:55.016
(phone rings)

07:55.058 --> 07:57.477
Hello.

07:57.518 --> 08:00.397
This is Commandant Spangler

07:57.518 --> 08:00.397
from the Marlin Academy.

08:00.439 --> 08:01.440
Oh, yes.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.399
Sorry to disturb you.

08:02.441 --> 08:03.691
I'm just calling because

08:03.733 --> 08:05.526
we had an incident up here

08:03.733 --> 08:05.526
last weekend,

08:05.568 --> 08:07.195
and I've done

08:05.568 --> 08:07.195
a thorough investigation,

08:07.237 --> 08:08.613
and it appears your son Francis

08:08.655 --> 08:10.782
is a prime suspect.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.200
Well, that's impossible

08:12.242 --> 08:14.328
because he was with me

08:12.242 --> 08:14.328
last weekend.

08:14.369 --> 08:15.912
He was?

08:15.954 --> 08:18.581
Yes. Yes, we went fishing.

08:18.623 --> 08:19.499
You're sure?

08:19.540 --> 08:20.625
Smallmouth bass.

08:20.667 --> 08:21.918
Boy, those babies'll fight you.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.795
Yeah, I got the fish

08:21.960 --> 08:23.795
to prove it.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.797
You know,

08:23.837 --> 08:25.797
I should send you some.

08:25.839 --> 08:26.673
No, that's quite all right.

08:26.714 --> 08:28.133
No, I insist.

08:28.175 --> 08:31.136
Yeah, I got a freezer

08:28.175 --> 08:31.136
full of 'em.

08:35.098 --> 08:37.309
Okay, where's Domingo?

08:38.268 --> 08:40.354
Come on,

08:38.268 --> 08:40.354
I can smell him.

08:40.395 --> 08:41.896
Honey, do you think

08:41.938 --> 08:45.275
I just took

08:41.938 --> 08:45.275
Domingo away from you

08:45.317 --> 08:46.151
because I'm mean?

08:46.193 --> 08:47.486
Absolutely.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.445
Dewey, the reason

08:48.487 --> 08:50.071
I had to take

08:48.487 --> 08:50.071
your teddy bear away

08:50.113 --> 08:51.448
is because he's very dirty.

08:51.490 --> 08:52.615
He's covered

08:51.490 --> 08:52.615
with germs

08:52.657 --> 08:54.575
and he could make

08:52.657 --> 08:54.575
you very sick.

08:54.617 --> 08:55.827
He wouldn't do that.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.329
He loves me.

08:57.371 --> 08:58.830
It's the germs, sweetie.

08:58.872 --> 09:01.624
There're tiny bugs

08:58.872 --> 09:01.624
carrying disease,

09:01.666 --> 09:03.293
and Domingo is covered

09:01.666 --> 09:03.293
with them.

09:03.335 --> 09:05.379
Now, when you touch him,

09:03.335 --> 09:05.379
they get on your hands,

09:05.420 --> 09:07.755
and what do you suppose happens

09:05.420 --> 09:07.755
if you touch your eyes?

09:07.797 --> 09:09.383
Well, I'll tell you

09:07.797 --> 09:09.383
what happens.

09:09.424 --> 09:11.843
The germs get in there

09:09.424 --> 09:11.843
and they infect them,

09:11.885 --> 09:13.094
and you get very sick

09:13.136 --> 09:14.929
and eventually

09:13.136 --> 09:14.929
your optic nerve rots away

09:14.971 --> 09:17.098
and your eyes fall out.

09:17.140 --> 09:19.600
Now, if you want to keep

09:17.140 --> 09:19.600
Domingo, you can.

09:19.642 --> 09:23.563
But if you want to keep your

09:19.642 --> 09:23.563
eyes, you'll give Domingo to me.

09:25.315 --> 09:28.902
You made the smart choice,

09:25.315 --> 09:28.902
sweetie.

09:30.404 --> 09:32.447
Sleep tight.

09:36.410 --> 09:37.618
Hey, Malcolm.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.620
I want to sit alone.

09:39.662 --> 09:40.621
Yeah, hi.

09:40.663 --> 09:42.582
So, I signed us up

09:40.663 --> 09:42.582
as lab partners.

09:42.623 --> 09:43.624
You know, Cynthia,

09:43.666 --> 09:45.668
you're spending

09:43.666 --> 09:45.668
all your time with me.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.546
Maybe it'd be a good thing

09:47.587 --> 09:49.506
if you branched out

09:47.587 --> 09:49.506
a little bit?

09:49.548 --> 09:51.341
Just seemed like

09:49.548 --> 09:51.341
a good idea.

09:51.383 --> 09:52.633
We get along so well,

09:52.675 --> 09:55.595
I just thought we've

09:52.675 --> 09:55.595
got a good thing going.

09:55.636 --> 09:56.721
"Thing"?

09:56.763 --> 09:57.722
Ooh, Malcolm,

09:57.764 --> 09:59.516
having lunch

09:57.764 --> 09:59.516
with your girlfriend?

09:59.558 --> 10:00.934
She's not

09:59.558 --> 10:00.934
my girlfriend.

10:00.975 --> 10:01.935
Oh, I don't know.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.520
I think I see a spark.

10:03.562 --> 10:04.521
Boop.

10:04.563 --> 10:05.688
Please don't touch me.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.315
Yeah, that'll work.

10:07.357 --> 10:09.568
Oh, she doesn't like

10:07.357 --> 10:09.568
to be touched.

10:09.609 --> 10:12.946
Well, then, maybe

10:09.609 --> 10:12.946
I'll do this. Ow!

10:12.987 --> 10:17.700
Now, say your body is composed

10:12.987 --> 10:17.700
entirely of snot.

10:17.742 --> 10:20.661
My body is composed

10:17.742 --> 10:20.661
entirely of snot.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.414
Anything you want to add?

10:20.703 --> 10:22.414
I'm good.

10:22.456 --> 10:24.499
(whimpers)

10:25.959 --> 10:26.918
What was that?

10:26.960 --> 10:28.169
It's Krav Maga--

10:28.211 --> 10:31.131
the official self-defense

10:28.211 --> 10:31.131
system of the Israeli army.

10:31.172 --> 10:33.258
Maybe I'll show

10:31.172 --> 10:33.258
you sometime

10:33.300 --> 10:35.635
if you think you

10:33.300 --> 10:35.635
can handle it.

10:50.024 --> 10:51.692
What's with all the fish?

10:51.734 --> 10:53.445
Oh, nothing, I just did

10:51.734 --> 10:53.445
something incredibly stupid

10:53.487 --> 10:54.695
and shortsighted.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.406
You going to put those

10:54.737 --> 10:56.406
in the freezer?

10:56.448 --> 10:57.574
Just for tonight.

10:57.616 --> 11:00.452
Tomorrow they go

10:57.616 --> 11:00.452
in the mail.

11:02.203 --> 11:03.413
Dewey, what are you doing?

11:03.455 --> 11:04.789
I'm killing the germs.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.207
I hate germs.

11:06.249 --> 11:07.667
Germs are scary.

11:08.876 --> 11:11.838
Don't forget the germs

11:08.876 --> 11:11.838
in the oven.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.715
(phone rings)

11:12.880 --> 11:14.715
Hello.

11:14.757 --> 11:15.883
You are the best dad ever.

11:15.925 --> 11:16.968
I am not.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.303
I'm a terrible dad.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.263
I never should've lied for you.

11:20.305 --> 11:22.390
Well, the important thing is

11:20.305 --> 11:22.390
that this is all behind us

11:22.432 --> 11:23.724
and I've learned my lesson.

11:23.766 --> 11:24.725
What lesson is that?

11:24.767 --> 11:27.728
That you are the best dad ever.

11:27.770 --> 11:31.441
You know, Francis, I don't feel

11:27.770 --> 11:31.441
much like talking right now.

11:31.483 --> 11:32.526
(spraying)

11:35.903 --> 11:37.489
Yes, Commandant Spangler,

11:37.531 --> 11:39.616
this is Francis' father.

11:39.658 --> 11:43.995
I'm-I'm afraid I... lied to you.

11:44.037 --> 11:47.748
Francis is the cadet responsible

11:44.037 --> 11:47.748
for damaging your car.

11:47.790 --> 11:49.668
I see.

11:49.708 --> 11:51.211
(cadet screaming)

11:51.252 --> 11:55.756
Well, that puts me in somewhat

11:51.252 --> 11:55.756
of an awkward position.

11:55.798 --> 12:00.053
You see, the culprit is being

11:55.798 --> 12:00.053
disciplined as we speak.

12:00.094 --> 12:01.555
But Francis did it.

12:01.596 --> 12:03.223
You-You're punishing

12:01.596 --> 12:03.223
the wrong cadet.

12:03.264 --> 12:04.558
I beg your pardon.

12:04.599 --> 12:07.435
In my 30 years at this academy

12:07.477 --> 12:09.770
I have never caned

12:07.477 --> 12:09.770
the wrong cadet.

12:09.812 --> 12:12.524
Sir, did you say "caned"?

12:12.566 --> 12:14.859
No.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.695
Sir...

12:16.735 --> 12:17.778
Consider the matter closed.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.489
But, sir, you...

12:19.531 --> 12:21.866
(cadet screaming)

12:23.784 --> 12:25.328
Take five, fellas.

12:28.623 --> 12:30.291
Yeah, we're having

12:28.623 --> 12:30.291
lunch together.

12:30.333 --> 12:31.668
So what?

12:31.710 --> 12:33.752
She likes to sit

12:31.710 --> 12:33.752
next to me.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.755
Looks like Lloyd

12:34.837 --> 12:36.755
and Dabney are having

12:36.797 --> 12:39.342
a pretty intense

12:36.797 --> 12:39.342
conversation.

12:40.510 --> 12:41.760
Did you know I could

12:40.510 --> 12:41.760
read lips?

12:42.845 --> 12:45.348
"I've noticed that 80%

12:42.845 --> 12:45.348
of my Doritos

12:45.390 --> 12:47.350
are isosceles triangles."

12:47.392 --> 12:48.935
"Wow, I'm impressed.

12:48.976 --> 12:50.144
Want to kiss?"

12:50.186 --> 12:52.105
"I was hoping you'd ask.

12:52.146 --> 12:54.773
Let me finish

12:52.146 --> 12:54.773
my sandwich first."

12:54.815 --> 12:56.192
"Waiting is

12:54.815 --> 12:56.192
such sweet agony."

12:56.234 --> 12:57.611
(laughs)

12:57.652 --> 12:59.696
"Okay, I'm ready."

12:59.738 --> 13:00.947
"Oh, now I'm not.

13:00.988 --> 13:03.408
I just took a bite

13:00.988 --> 13:03.408
of my sandwich."

13:03.450 --> 13:04.743
"Oh, you're such a tease."

13:12.125 --> 13:13.792
(snorts loudly)

13:17.880 --> 13:20.300
Now, if I apply pressure

13:17.880 --> 13:20.300
like this for ten seconds,

13:20.341 --> 13:21.842
you'll pass out.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.844
If I do it for 20 seconds,

13:23.886 --> 13:25.555
you'll die

13:23.886 --> 13:25.555
of a brain hemorrhage.

13:25.597 --> 13:26.640
Cool.

13:26.681 --> 13:28.349
Okay.

13:29.684 --> 13:31.311
Are you wearing perfume?

13:31.352 --> 13:33.313
Oh, it's my shampoo.

13:33.354 --> 13:35.649
Jasmine.

13:33.354 --> 13:35.649
Do you like it?

13:35.690 --> 13:37.233
Well, yeah.

13:35.690 --> 13:37.233
It smells good.

13:37.275 --> 13:38.859
It's supposed

13:37.275 --> 13:38.859
to get rid of my dandruff,

13:38.901 --> 13:40.903
but I'm not sure it's working.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.821
Here, what do you think?

13:45.158 --> 13:46.326
Malcolm?

13:46.367 --> 13:48.662
(laughing)

13:48.703 --> 13:50.246
Ooh.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.291
(laughs)

13:56.586 --> 13:59.213
Looks like you and Cynthia

13:56.586 --> 13:59.213
have some real chemistry.

13:59.255 --> 14:00.465
Would you shut up?

14:00.507 --> 14:03.343
No, see, it-it's

14:00.507 --> 14:03.343
a play on words.

14:03.384 --> 14:04.636
I said shut up.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.220
I'll e-mail it to you

14:06.262 --> 14:08.473
and some others,

14:06.262 --> 14:08.473
if you don't mind.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.891
So, have you figured out

14:08.515 --> 14:10.891
how many words

14:10.933 --> 14:11.976
your phone number makes?

14:12.018 --> 14:13.186
Mine makes five:

14:13.227 --> 14:15.772
Three in English

14:13.227 --> 14:15.772
and two in Esperanto.

14:15.814 --> 14:17.482
Just kidding.

14:17.524 --> 14:18.566
You know, if it's a joke

14:18.608 --> 14:19.900
you don't have to say

14:18.608 --> 14:19.900
"just kidding."

14:19.942 --> 14:21.194
It's either funny

14:19.942 --> 14:21.194
or it isn't.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.906
You know, just because

14:24.197 --> 14:25.906
you're cute

14:25.948 --> 14:27.534
doesn't mean

14:25.948 --> 14:27.534
you can be rude.

14:30.244 --> 14:31.912
That wasn't rude.

14:31.954 --> 14:33.080
That was...

14:33.122 --> 14:34.708
What's a...?

14:34.749 --> 14:36.584
Did she say I was cute?!

14:36.626 --> 14:38.252
Hi, Malcolm.

14:36.626 --> 14:38.252
What's going on?

14:38.294 --> 14:39.379
I just wanted to talk to you

14:39.420 --> 14:40.880
about something

14:39.420 --> 14:40.880
that's bothering me.

14:40.921 --> 14:41.922
What's it about?

14:41.964 --> 14:42.882
There's this girl, and...

14:42.923 --> 14:43.924
Keep Mom out of it!

14:43.966 --> 14:44.925
What?!

14:44.967 --> 14:46.093
I am warning you,

14:46.135 --> 14:47.637
keep Mom out

14:46.135 --> 14:47.637
of your love life.

14:47.679 --> 14:49.430
Mom has nothing to do with this.

14:49.472 --> 14:50.724
Trust me-- yes, she does.

14:50.765 --> 14:51.932
She will ruin it, I swear.

14:51.974 --> 14:53.434
Whatever Mom tells you,

14:51.974 --> 14:53.434
don't do it.

14:53.476 --> 14:55.102
And don't do the opposite,

14:53.476 --> 14:55.102
either!

14:55.144 --> 14:58.189
The way it's worked for me is...

14:58.231 --> 15:00.233
Actually,

14:58.231 --> 15:00.233
it's never worked for me.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.319
I just don't know

15:01.568 --> 15:03.319
if it's a good idea.

15:03.361 --> 15:05.112
I've thought about

15:03.361 --> 15:05.112
this a long time.

15:05.154 --> 15:07.782
Okay, it's your call.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.204
When are you going

15:11.994 --> 15:13.204
to talk to Dewey?

15:13.246 --> 15:15.790
As soon as he finishes

15:13.246 --> 15:15.790
the windows.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.299
Hey! I want a rematch.

15:25.341 --> 15:26.967
Last time the sun

15:25.341 --> 15:26.967
was in my eyes,

15:27.009 --> 15:27.968
and I wasn't really...

15:28.010 --> 15:29.470
(coughing)

15:31.013 --> 15:32.014
Hey, Malcolm.

15:32.056 --> 15:33.933
What are you doing

15:32.056 --> 15:33.933
after school?

15:33.974 --> 15:35.351
We're getting a dog,

15:33.974 --> 15:35.351
and I thought you

15:35.393 --> 15:36.977
might want to help

15:35.393 --> 15:36.977
us pick one out.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.979
My mom wants a

15:37.019 --> 15:38.979
golden retriever,

15:39.021 --> 15:40.774
but I'm leaning

15:39.021 --> 15:40.774
more toward

15:40.815 --> 15:42.233
a flat-coated

15:40.815 --> 15:42.233
retriever...

15:42.275 --> 15:43.651
because everyone

15:42.275 --> 15:43.651
has goldens, and...

15:43.693 --> 15:45.653
I don't want to be lab partners

15:43.693 --> 15:45.653
with you anymore.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.530
What?

15:47.572 --> 15:49.115
I mean, it wasn't my idea.

15:49.156 --> 15:51.785
The teacher thought I should

15:49.156 --> 15:51.785
partner up with someone else.

15:51.826 --> 15:53.828
Okay.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.084
(Reese crying)

16:05.047 --> 16:07.007
Hello, son.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.511
Dad, what are you doing here?

16:10.553 --> 16:11.679
I need to talk to you.

16:11.721 --> 16:13.890
You drove eight hours

16:11.721 --> 16:13.890
just to talk to me?

16:13.932 --> 16:17.351
Well, I thought it best

16:13.932 --> 16:17.351
that I do this face-

16:13.932 --> 16:17.351
to-face, man-to-man.

16:17.393 --> 16:18.686
What is it?

16:18.728 --> 16:20.980
Francis, you wrecked

16:18.728 --> 16:20.980
Commandant Spangler's car

16:21.021 --> 16:22.106
and you weren't

16:21.021 --> 16:22.106
punished for it.

16:23.566 --> 16:26.986
Another cadet was, and

16:23.566 --> 16:26.986
that just isn't right.

16:30.114 --> 16:32.742
That's what you came

16:30.114 --> 16:32.742
all the way down here

16:30.114 --> 16:32.742
to tell me?

16:32.784 --> 16:34.702
Well, that, and

16:32.784 --> 16:34.702
your mother said

16:34.744 --> 16:37.037
you can come home

16:34.744 --> 16:37.037
from military school,

16:37.079 --> 16:39.624
and I told her I didn't

16:37.079 --> 16:39.624
think it was a good idea.

16:39.666 --> 16:40.625
What?!

16:39.666 --> 16:40.625
Francis,

16:40.667 --> 16:42.126
neither one of us

16:40.667 --> 16:42.126
did the right thing,

16:42.168 --> 16:44.044
and there has to be

16:42.168 --> 16:44.044
consequences for that.

16:44.086 --> 16:45.171
Oh, come on!

16:45.212 --> 16:46.547
Look, if I

16:45.212 --> 16:46.547
didn't do this

16:46.589 --> 16:48.090
I'd be failing

16:46.589 --> 16:48.090
you as a parent.

16:48.132 --> 16:49.509
There's got to be

16:48.132 --> 16:49.509
another way.

16:49.550 --> 16:50.593
No, no, believe me.

16:50.635 --> 16:52.219
I wrestled with this

16:50.635 --> 16:52.219
on the drive over.

16:52.261 --> 16:53.805
This is the only

16:52.261 --> 16:53.805
fair thing to do

16:53.847 --> 16:55.890
because it deals with

16:53.847 --> 16:55.890
my complicity as well.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.603
Guess there really isn't

16:58.100 --> 17:00.603
anything more to say.

17:03.189 --> 17:06.066
Well, looks like you have

17:03.189 --> 17:06.066
some kind of activity planned,

17:06.108 --> 17:07.568
so I'll get out of your hair.

17:07.610 --> 17:10.029
Hey.

17:13.992 --> 17:15.368
I love you, son.

17:16.619 --> 17:19.038
Have fun.

17:31.801 --> 17:33.594
Dewey, we have got to talk.

17:33.636 --> 17:36.055
Honey, when I talked

17:33.636 --> 17:36.055
to you about germs,

17:36.096 --> 17:37.348
I was just trying to scare you.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.017
That was wrong.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.643
This isn't about germs.

17:40.685 --> 17:42.144
Sweetie, it's about growing up.

17:42.186 --> 17:44.104
The reason I had

17:42.186 --> 17:44.104
to take Domingo

17:44.146 --> 17:45.147
away from you

17:44.146 --> 17:45.147
is because

17:45.189 --> 17:46.357
you are too grown-up

17:46.399 --> 17:47.692
for a ratty, old stuffed animal

17:47.734 --> 17:49.652
that's falling apart.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.652
(screeching)

17:49.694 --> 17:52.572
Dewey, you have

17:49.694 --> 17:52.572
got to stop this.

17:52.613 --> 17:54.114
It's a little bug.

17:52.613 --> 17:54.114
It never hurt anyone.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.241
But it has germs on it!

17:55.282 --> 17:57.035
Okay, this is enough.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.796
See?

18:08.838 --> 18:10.297
Nothing happened to me.

18:12.508 --> 18:13.927
Okay?

18:13.968 --> 18:15.135
Okay.

18:15.177 --> 18:18.431
So take off the plastic

18:15.177 --> 18:18.431
and go eat your breakfast.

18:25.187 --> 18:26.522
So, anyway...

18:26.564 --> 18:28.232
Look at her,

18:26.564 --> 18:28.232
talking to some idiot.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.109
Who is that guy?

18:31.193 --> 18:32.946
What am I saying?

18:31.193 --> 18:32.946
I don't care.

18:32.987 --> 18:34.154
Why should I care?

18:34.196 --> 18:36.156
There's nothing that special

18:34.196 --> 18:36.156
about her.

18:36.198 --> 18:39.243
Why is this bugging me

18:36.198 --> 18:39.243
so much?

18:39.285 --> 18:40.453
(laughing)

18:40.494 --> 18:41.955
If I'm such a genius

18:41.996 --> 18:44.540
I should be able to come up with

18:41.996 --> 18:44.540
a smart way to deal with this.

18:44.582 --> 18:46.042
Why did you

18:44.582 --> 18:46.042
throw a brick

18:46.084 --> 18:49.169
through my daughter's window

18:46.084 --> 18:49.169
at 2:00 in the morning?

18:49.211 --> 18:50.421
I don't know.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.131
I really don't.

18:52.882 --> 18:54.092
How could

18:52.882 --> 18:54.092
you do that?

18:54.133 --> 18:55.635
It really scared

18:54.133 --> 18:55.635
me, Malcolm.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.678
I don't know, I'm sorry.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.678
The one good thing is,

18:57.720 --> 18:59.513
Mom'll kill me before this

18:57.720 --> 18:59.513
goes on for too much longer.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.181
I didn't move

18:59.555 --> 19:01.181
to the suburbs

19:01.223 --> 19:04.102
so my daughter could be

19:01.223 --> 19:04.102
attacked in the dead of night.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.227
Oh, for God's sake.

19:05.269 --> 19:07.480
He wasn't attacking her.

19:05.269 --> 19:07.480
He's got a crush on her.

19:07.521 --> 19:09.189
Beg pardon?

19:09.231 --> 19:10.190
Mom, don't.

19:09.231 --> 19:10.190
Don't worry,

19:10.232 --> 19:11.442
Malcolm's going to be punished.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.193
But this is nothing

19:11.484 --> 19:13.193
to get panicked about.

19:13.235 --> 19:14.278
But...

19:13.235 --> 19:14.278
Don't you remember

19:14.320 --> 19:16.196
when you were his age--

19:14.320 --> 19:16.196
all the dumb things

19:16.238 --> 19:17.657
you did with your

19:16.238 --> 19:17.657
little girlfriends?

19:17.698 --> 19:19.199
Um, I'm not his...

19:19.241 --> 19:20.326
It's puberty!

19:20.367 --> 19:22.078
Their bodies are going

19:20.367 --> 19:22.078
all crazy down there

19:22.120 --> 19:23.454
and they can't do

19:22.120 --> 19:23.454
anything about it.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.164
So they start

19:23.496 --> 19:25.164
all that silly making out

19:25.205 --> 19:26.874
and then they get all tingly

19:25.205 --> 19:26.874
and charged up

19:26.916 --> 19:29.002
and they don't

19:26.916 --> 19:29.002
know what to do

19:26.916 --> 19:29.002
with themselves

19:29.043 --> 19:30.210
so they throw

19:29.043 --> 19:30.210
bricks and things.

19:30.252 --> 19:32.505
My oldest son set

19:30.252 --> 19:32.505
a doghouse on fire.

19:32.546 --> 19:34.340
They are idiots at this age.

19:34.381 --> 19:36.134
That's just what they do.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.218
Yes, well... that-that may be,

19:38.260 --> 19:41.722
but this kind of behavior

19:38.260 --> 19:41.722
is not acceptable.

19:41.764 --> 19:43.557
No, it isn't...

19:41.764 --> 19:43.557
but you'd better get used to it

19:43.599 --> 19:45.225
because I'm gonna

19:43.599 --> 19:45.225
tell you right now,

19:45.267 --> 19:46.936
this one is an

19:45.267 --> 19:46.936
early bloomer.

19:46.978 --> 19:48.521
She's gonna pop out

19:46.978 --> 19:48.521
of every bra you buy

19:48.562 --> 19:49.897
for the next three years.

19:49.939 --> 19:51.565
You're going to be

19:49.939 --> 19:51.565
self-conscious,

19:51.607 --> 19:53.233
but don't let it

19:51.607 --> 19:53.233
make you slouch.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.361
You're gonna be happy about it

19:53.275 --> 19:55.361
when you get to college.

19:55.402 --> 19:56.946
Come on...

19:56.988 --> 19:58.322
I'll give you the number

19:56.988 --> 19:58.322
of a glass company.

19:58.364 --> 19:59.740
We give him

19:58.364 --> 19:59.740
a lot of business.

19:59.782 --> 20:00.867
He'll treat you right.

20:11.044 --> 20:13.838
Well, at least she didn't

20:11.044 --> 20:13.838
strip us and take pictures.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.882
The night is young.

20:21.888 --> 20:24.264
Okay, you know what?

20:24.306 --> 20:26.308
Big deal.

20:26.350 --> 20:28.561
I do like you.

20:28.602 --> 20:30.563
I'm willing to say it.

20:30.604 --> 20:32.857
I really like you a lot.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.274
I like you a lot.

20:34.316 --> 20:36.235
Okay, then...

20:40.406 --> 20:41.281
What?

20:41.323 --> 20:42.324
I'm not all tingly

20:42.366 --> 20:43.450
and charged up, okay?

20:43.492 --> 20:45.369
Nah. Me neither.

20:46.996 --> 20:49.415
And my body's

20:46.996 --> 20:49.415
not going crazy.

20:49.456 --> 20:51.458
Fine.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.796
God, why'd she have

20:53.419 --> 20:55.796
to say all that stuff?

20:55.838 --> 20:57.297
Malcolm,

20:55.838 --> 20:57.297
what are you doing?

20:57.339 --> 20:59.466
Look, Cynthia, believe me,

20:57.339 --> 20:59.466
I'm trying to kiss you,

20:59.508 --> 21:02.178
and I think if you

20:59.508 --> 21:02.178
just give me a minute

20:59.508 --> 21:02.178
to clear my head,

21:02.220 --> 21:03.429
I'll be able to

21:02.220 --> 21:03.429
kiss you, okay?

21:03.470 --> 21:06.182
Excuse me?!

21:03.470 --> 21:06.182
Francis said

21:03.470 --> 21:06.182
she'd do this.

21:06.224 --> 21:08.059
And who, exactly,

21:06.224 --> 21:08.059
is Francis?

21:06.224 --> 21:08.059
It's not what

21:06.224 --> 21:08.059
you think.

21:08.101 --> 21:10.895
He's my brother.

21:08.101 --> 21:10.895
You were going to kiss me,

21:08.101 --> 21:10.895
and you're thinking

21:10.937 --> 21:12.980
about your brother?

21:10.937 --> 21:12.980
No, I was thinking

21:10.937 --> 21:12.980
about my mom.

21:13.022 --> 21:16.483
No, I mean, I was

21:13.022 --> 21:16.483
thinking about your bra.

21:16.525 --> 21:19.070
I mean... I was thinking

21:16.525 --> 21:19.070
about what's  in  your bra.

21:19.112 --> 21:21.655
Uh... I mean, what

21:19.112 --> 21:21.655
will  be  in your bra.

21:21.697 --> 21:23.908
Oh, can I start over?

21:35.711 --> 21:38.714
I wonder if I can convince

21:35.711 --> 21:38.714
anyone this is a hickey.
