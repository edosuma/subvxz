WEBVTT

00:05.179 --> 00:06.963
- Let me help with that.
- No, I got it.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.356
- You sure?
- Yeah.

00:08.399 --> 00:10.488
- You hungry?
- No.

00:10.532 --> 00:12.577
- I can make my famous
French toast.

00:12.621 --> 00:15.276
- You don't have to do that.
- What?

00:15.319 --> 00:16.755
- Pretend like
nothing's changed.

00:16.799 --> 00:19.454
- I'm not.
I'm just trying to help.

00:19.497 --> 00:21.412
- I know, I just--

00:21.456 --> 00:23.153
Look, you should go to work.

00:23.197 --> 00:24.763
I'm pretty sure the bad guys
aren't taking a day off

00:24.807 --> 00:27.636
because I had a miscarriage.

00:27.679 --> 00:30.465
I feel like I need some space.

00:33.816 --> 00:35.339
Yeah.

00:44.174 --> 00:46.089
- She's doing good I think.

00:46.133 --> 00:48.178
Boss put her on an IOD
for a few days, so...

00:48.222 --> 00:50.093
- That's good to hear.
- Yeah.

00:50.137 --> 00:52.182
- Hey, Adam.

00:52.226 --> 00:53.488
Uh, how you doing?

00:53.531 --> 00:55.272
I'm really sorry
about everything.

00:55.316 --> 00:58.101
You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

00:58.145 --> 00:59.537
Man plans.
God laughs.

00:59.581 --> 01:01.235
- Mm-hmm.
You need anything

01:01.278 --> 01:03.150
you let me know.
- Okay, thanks.

01:04.412 --> 01:06.240
- Vanessa.

01:07.589 --> 01:09.373
- Ben.
Ooh.

01:09.417 --> 01:11.332
- You look great.

01:11.375 --> 01:13.638
I can't believe
you're a police officer.

01:13.682 --> 01:15.292
- Most of the time
I don't either.

01:15.336 --> 01:18.382
- I'm proud of you.
- Thank you.

01:18.426 --> 01:21.124
We both know I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for you.

01:22.517 --> 01:24.432
So what's up?
Why'd you come by?

01:24.475 --> 01:26.477
- Yeah, I need a favor.

01:27.739 --> 01:29.219
- Name it.

01:29.263 --> 01:31.395
- I'm looking for a guy
I've been working with.

01:31.439 --> 01:32.744
He's an addict.

01:32.788 --> 01:35.878
In and out of shelters,
but mostly on the streets.

01:35.921 --> 01:38.794
- And he's gone missing?
- Yeah.

01:38.837 --> 01:41.231
I had a job interview set up
for him yesterday.

01:41.275 --> 01:44.147
We even picked out a suit.
He never showed up.

01:44.191 --> 01:45.931
I haven't been able
to reach him since.

01:45.975 --> 01:48.499
I know this is small potatoes
for someone like you--

01:48.543 --> 01:49.892
- Aw, Ben.

01:49.935 --> 01:52.286
You've been there for me
since I was six years old.

01:53.939 --> 01:56.725
Send me everything you have
on this guy.

01:56.768 --> 01:57.856
- Thanks.

01:57.900 --> 01:59.771
- Yeah.

02:02.557 --> 02:05.777
- That you, Rojas?
- Morning.

02:05.821 --> 02:08.606
- You coming or going?
- Going.

02:08.650 --> 02:09.825
- Hitting the streets already?

02:09.868 --> 02:11.435
- Well, I'm trying to track
down a missing.

02:11.479 --> 02:12.915
Got a BOLO out.

02:12.958 --> 02:15.265
It's a personal thing.
Off the record.

02:15.309 --> 02:16.832
- You need some help?

02:22.925 --> 02:25.884
'- Roberto Albert Peña.
Three priors for possession.

02:25.928 --> 02:27.712
Last known was an apartment
in Pilsen.

02:27.756 --> 02:29.453
- My friend Ben
says he's homeless.

02:29.497 --> 02:30.802
- Who's your friend?

02:30.846 --> 02:32.369
- He's the Director
of Homeless Planning.

02:32.413 --> 02:34.676
He oversees
a bunch of shelters.

02:34.719 --> 02:36.808
I've known him
since I was a kid.

02:36.852 --> 02:39.246
- Okay, I got your back.
Let's get it.

02:41.465 --> 02:44.468
- If you hear from him, please,
let me know.

02:44.512 --> 02:45.730
- Yeah, if I see him
I'm gonna break his neck.

02:45.774 --> 02:47.776
Son of a bitch
owes me six months rent.

02:47.819 --> 02:49.821
His apartment stinks
like cigarettes.

02:51.736 --> 02:53.521
- Thanks for being
so cooperative!

02:55.479 --> 02:58.221
- All right, so what's next?
- Don't know.

02:58.265 --> 03:01.355
Maybe we start canvassing,
handing out photos?

03:01.398 --> 03:02.921
- Okay, we'll talk to me.
What's this about?

03:02.965 --> 03:05.750
The missing dude
or big homie, Ben?

03:05.794 --> 03:07.491
- Ben.

03:07.535 --> 03:09.319
He was my case worker
when I was a kid.

03:09.363 --> 03:10.929
Foster care.

03:10.973 --> 03:12.757
- What a good guy.

03:12.801 --> 03:15.673
- The best.
He saved my life.

03:15.717 --> 03:18.633
- What do you mean?

03:18.676 --> 03:19.808
- Long story.

03:19.851 --> 03:21.940
- I'd like to hear it
one day.

03:21.984 --> 03:23.899
- When I'm ready.

03:24.900 --> 03:28.382
- Meanwhile, I can always share
a story from my childhood too.

03:28.425 --> 03:30.862
Freshmen year I got cut
from the basketball team.

03:30.906 --> 03:33.517
I'm still not over that.
- Like Michael Jordan?

03:33.561 --> 03:35.519
- Just like Mike.

03:35.563 --> 03:38.479
- 2143 Squad,
can I mobile with 5021 Frank?

03:38.522 --> 03:41.743
- This is 5021 Frank.
Go with your traffic 2143.

03:41.786 --> 03:43.745
- We found
your missing person.

03:43.788 --> 03:46.269
- Copy that.
5021 Frank en route.

04:04.548 --> 04:06.289
- Hey.
- I got word.

04:08.683 --> 04:10.554
Guess they found
my card on him.

04:10.598 --> 04:12.774
- I'm so sorry, Ben.

04:14.036 --> 04:16.517
- That's where they found him?

04:16.560 --> 04:18.649
In a dumpster?

04:18.693 --> 04:20.956
Tossed like trash.

04:20.999 --> 04:23.959
- We'll find who did this.

04:24.002 --> 04:25.482
I promise.

04:33.534 --> 04:34.752
- Who found the body?

04:34.796 --> 04:36.319
- Construction worker.
- Uh-huh.

04:36.363 --> 04:37.842
- Lost his keys.

04:37.886 --> 04:39.931
Thought he accidentally
tossed them into the dumpster.

04:39.975 --> 04:42.064
Took a dive he won't forget.
- Hm.

04:42.107 --> 04:44.762
Your friend got any idea
who might've done it?

04:44.806 --> 04:47.635
- No, but I told him
I'd look into it.

04:47.678 --> 04:49.071
- Uh-huh.

04:49.114 --> 04:50.768
- I know this isn't the kind
of case we normally take.

04:50.812 --> 04:53.380
- Listen, you don't have to
apologize or explain.

04:53.423 --> 04:55.338
We got a dead body.
A dead person.

04:55.382 --> 04:57.906
We're taking it.

04:57.949 --> 05:00.125
So what'd the M.E. say?

05:00.169 --> 05:02.563
- Died from sharp force wounds.
- Uh-huh.

05:02.606 --> 05:04.608
- Probably a hunting knife
or serrated edge.

05:04.652 --> 05:05.914
- Uh-huh.

05:05.957 --> 05:07.045
- Time of death between
10:00 p.m. and 1:00 a.m.

05:07.089 --> 05:08.612
There's no blood present
in the dumpster,

05:08.656 --> 05:10.527
so he was probably killed
somewhere else.

05:10.571 --> 05:12.747
- All right--Roberto got any
gang affiliations?

05:12.790 --> 05:14.139
- No.

05:14.183 --> 05:16.838
He's an out of work roofer
with a big drug problem.

05:16.881 --> 05:19.406
I mean, according to Ben,
he was doing better.

05:19.449 --> 05:20.972
- All right,
so let's pound the pavement.

05:21.016 --> 05:23.018
Find a witness,
security camera.

05:23.061 --> 05:25.629
And dig into Roberto.
Track his movements.

05:25.673 --> 05:27.152
Where was he staying?
What was he doing?

05:27.196 --> 05:28.502
- Okay.

05:48.957 --> 05:51.002
I talked to Platt.

05:51.046 --> 05:52.743
She was going through
Roberto's priors.

05:52.787 --> 05:54.919
He got jammed up last week.
Here.

05:54.963 --> 05:57.008
Outside this church.
- Why wasn't that in his file?

05:57.052 --> 05:58.575
- It was just a contact card.

05:58.619 --> 06:00.011
Responding officers
didn't arrest him.

06:00.055 --> 06:02.927
I mean, this could be
where he's been living.

06:05.930 --> 06:08.629
- Excuse us.
Hey, Chicago PD.

06:08.672 --> 06:10.935
You serve?
- Iraq, four tours.

06:10.979 --> 06:13.155
- I did two tours
in Afghanistan.

06:13.198 --> 06:15.592
This is, uh, Detective Rojas,
Detective Upton.

06:15.636 --> 06:18.116
I'm Detective Halstead.
- Alex.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.510
- We're looking for information
on a Roberto Peña.

06:20.554 --> 06:22.947
- Yeah, I know Roberto.
- He stays here?

06:22.991 --> 06:25.036
- On and off.
Not like you need a key.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.516
- When was the last time
you saw him?

06:26.560 --> 06:29.171
- I don't know.
Maybe two weeks ago?

06:29.214 --> 06:31.216
- Did he get into any trouble
around here?

06:31.260 --> 06:33.697
- Nah, he was all right.
He was big talker.

06:33.741 --> 06:35.133
Serious dope fiend.

06:35.177 --> 06:37.005
What'd he do?
- He was murdered.

06:37.048 --> 06:39.486
- Damn.
What happened?

06:39.529 --> 06:40.661
- We don't know yet.

06:40.704 --> 06:41.966
Does he have any friends
around here?

06:42.010 --> 06:44.012
- He, uh, usually hung out
with Sammy the T.

06:44.055 --> 06:45.622
- Who's that?

06:55.110 --> 06:56.546
- You Sammy?

07:00.202 --> 07:01.899
- Hey, uh, yeah, uh...

07:01.943 --> 07:04.728
were you looking to buy that
Bear shirt earlier?

07:04.772 --> 07:06.817
- No, sorry.

07:06.861 --> 07:08.950
I'm Detective Upton.
This is Officer Rojas.

07:08.993 --> 07:11.735
We understand that
you know Roberto Peña.

07:11.779 --> 07:13.476
- You're police.

07:13.520 --> 07:14.477
- Yeah,
but you're not in trouble.

07:14.521 --> 07:16.479
We just wanna talk.
- To talk?

07:16.523 --> 07:17.741
- Mm-hmm.

07:17.785 --> 07:19.830
- Have you seen Roberto lately?

07:21.528 --> 07:22.703
- Last night.

07:22.746 --> 07:24.661
- Here?
- No.

07:24.705 --> 07:27.925
We went to an AA meeting
on Clark.

07:27.969 --> 07:29.187
Free cookies.

07:29.231 --> 07:31.538
- Did Roberto seem upset
about anything?

07:31.581 --> 07:34.584
- Just about the man following
me in the blue pickup truck.

07:34.628 --> 07:37.282
- Was he following you
or Roberto?

07:38.849 --> 07:43.593
You guys want me
to seriously answer that?

07:43.637 --> 07:45.247
You guys are hilarious.

07:45.290 --> 07:47.118
- Look, we just wanna know
who he was.

07:47.162 --> 07:49.512
- I certainly don't know
his name--

07:49.556 --> 07:53.777
or CIA rank.
I'm sure you do.

07:53.821 --> 07:55.083
- Excuse me?

07:55.126 --> 07:58.260
- I assume you're running point
for him now.

07:58.303 --> 08:00.654
Ah, I didn't realize
how deep this went.

08:03.004 --> 08:04.875
Look, Sammy.

08:08.183 --> 08:11.665
It's okay, Sammy.
I just want to talk.

08:11.708 --> 08:14.145
How long you been living here?

08:14.189 --> 08:17.322
- A couple months.
It's quiet.

08:17.366 --> 08:19.194
Good for reading.

08:19.237 --> 08:22.153
And I thought they'd never
find me here.

08:22.197 --> 08:25.809
- So this guy who
was following you, the CIA--

08:25.853 --> 08:28.725
you sure he wasn't
following Roberto?

08:28.769 --> 08:30.248
- Could've been.

08:30.292 --> 08:33.991
Why?
Something happen to Roberto?

08:34.035 --> 08:36.951
- He was murdered, Sammy.

08:39.127 --> 08:41.346
- I used to give Roberto
legal advice.

08:41.390 --> 08:43.305
He'd pay me in snacks.

08:43.348 --> 08:45.263
- You a lawyer?

08:45.307 --> 08:49.137
- I went to law school
for two years.

08:49.180 --> 08:51.835
- Do you know where Roberto
was staying?

08:51.879 --> 08:53.924
- No.
Uh...

08:58.799 --> 09:00.191
I think you guys should go.

09:04.152 --> 09:05.980
- One more question.

09:06.023 --> 09:08.069
How much for that cool
Harry Caray shirt?

09:11.376 --> 09:13.030
- Sarge.
- What do you got?

09:13.074 --> 09:14.684
- I followed up
on the T-shirt guy's story

09:14.728 --> 09:16.991
about going to
an AA meeting with Roberto,

09:17.034 --> 09:18.862
so this is security footage
from the community center,

09:18.906 --> 09:21.082
and this is from an auto shop
down the block.

09:23.127 --> 09:26.609
- Blue pickup.
- I'ma run that plate.

09:27.958 --> 09:30.265
- Zero, one, X-ray,
nine, four, King, two.

09:33.007 --> 09:35.009
- Driver's got a gun on him.

09:38.665 --> 09:41.363
- Sammy was telling the truth.
- Time stamp says 7:12.

09:41.406 --> 09:43.887
That's a few hours before
Roberto was killed.

09:43.931 --> 09:45.410
- All right, here we go.

09:45.454 --> 09:48.413
Blue 2011 Ford.
Belongs to a Joe Mason.

09:48.457 --> 09:50.764
Convicted felon, recently
paroled out of Stateville

09:50.807 --> 09:53.680
on an attempted murder beef.
LKA's a house in Elsdon.

09:53.723 --> 09:55.638
- Okay, Jay, you and Hailey
get over there.

09:55.682 --> 09:57.379
Stand by for the warrant.

10:03.994 --> 10:05.953
There's our truck.

10:09.957 --> 10:11.219
You ready.
- Mm, yep.

10:11.262 --> 10:12.263
- Let's go.

10:17.225 --> 10:19.401
Joe Mason?

10:19.444 --> 10:21.316
Chicago PD.
You got a second?

10:21.359 --> 10:24.014
Hey, man--hey!
- 5021 Henry.

10:24.058 --> 10:25.320
Got an offender
fleeing on foot.

10:25.363 --> 10:27.757
Male, black, 5'10",
black jacket, blue jeans.

10:35.156 --> 10:37.201
- Put your arms up.

10:37.245 --> 10:38.420
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

10:38.463 --> 10:39.464
- I didn't do anything, man.

10:39.508 --> 10:40.770
- Yeah?
Where's the fire, Joe?

10:40.814 --> 10:42.946
- 5021 Henry.
Advise units to disregard.

10:42.990 --> 10:44.469
Offender in custody.
- What is this?

10:44.513 --> 10:46.689
What is this?
- It's not mine, dog.

10:46.733 --> 10:47.821
- Yeah?

10:47.864 --> 10:49.257
Unless it's sugar,
you're coming in.

10:49.300 --> 10:50.345
Put your hands
behind your back.

10:50.388 --> 10:51.651
Put your hands behind
your back!

10:56.830 --> 11:00.572
- Look, I made a mistake, man.
- Yes, you did.

11:02.618 --> 11:04.098
- I'm an addict.

11:07.318 --> 11:09.494
- You know Roberto Peña?

11:09.538 --> 11:10.582
- Who?

11:12.541 --> 11:15.370
- Roberto Peña.
- Yeah.

11:15.413 --> 11:17.720
Yeah, I know him.
- Mm-hmm.

11:17.764 --> 11:19.374
- That son of a bitch
broke into my truck.

11:19.417 --> 11:20.549
- Hm.

11:20.592 --> 11:22.333
- I caught him red-handed,
and he ran.

11:22.377 --> 11:24.248
- What'd he steal?

11:25.206 --> 11:27.730
You know, I were you,
I'd keep talking.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.297
'Cause you were the last person

11:29.340 --> 11:31.473
who was with Roberto
before that.

11:31.516 --> 11:33.649
- Jesus--look, man, I ain't
had nothing to do with that.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.259
- What'd he steal, Joe?

11:36.783 --> 11:38.262
What did he steal?
- Coke.

11:40.482 --> 11:41.875
I had some
in my glove compartment.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.532
So, I drove everywhere
trying to find that punk.

11:47.576 --> 11:48.795
- Mm.

11:48.838 --> 11:50.318
- He said he still had half
of my cocaine,

11:50.361 --> 11:51.754
so we went to some empty house
he was squatting at.

11:51.798 --> 11:52.929
- Okay.

11:52.973 --> 11:54.539
So you went to the house--
- Yeah.

11:54.583 --> 11:57.934
- You got your drugs, then
you carved him up, didn't you?

11:57.978 --> 11:59.675
- Wait, wait--
no, no, no, no.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.198
- That's why you
slit his throat?

12:01.242 --> 12:02.634
- No, look, see I was--
- Why'd you cut his hands off?

12:02.678 --> 12:03.635
- I was just trying
to get high.

12:03.679 --> 12:04.767
- Did you slit his throat?

12:04.811 --> 12:06.334
- No, I was just trying
to get high!

12:06.377 --> 12:09.641
- What time did you leave?
- Sometime after 8:00.

12:09.685 --> 12:11.818
Then I went to
my buddy's 40th birthday party.

12:14.385 --> 12:16.387
This guy was still alive
when I left that house.

12:16.431 --> 12:19.521
- Hm.
We're gonna check your story.

12:19.564 --> 12:22.524
And if you're lying,

12:22.567 --> 12:24.178
you're going back to the joint.

12:24.221 --> 12:27.224
This time you ain't coming
back, you understand?

12:40.542 --> 12:42.805
- So we found
a better way in.

12:44.285 --> 12:46.809
- Squatters usually lock
the doors, not the windows.

12:46.853 --> 12:48.071
That's how they get in and out.

12:51.727 --> 12:55.209
- Did you spend a lot of time
on the streets back in the day?

12:55.252 --> 12:56.906
- Just a few weeks.

12:56.950 --> 12:58.690
Not as bad as you think.

12:58.734 --> 13:01.606
- Be careful.

13:16.665 --> 13:18.798
- Clear.
- Clear.

13:25.456 --> 13:26.849
- Clear.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.551
Yep.

13:33.595 --> 13:35.423
This is definitely where
the murder went down.

13:37.904 --> 13:39.906
- Clear.
- Clear.

13:39.949 --> 13:41.951
- I'll call Voight.

13:44.301 --> 13:46.260
- And I found some of
Roberto's clothes,

13:46.303 --> 13:48.305
personal items.
He was definitely living here.

13:48.349 --> 13:50.307
- And we didn't recover
the knife?

13:50.351 --> 13:54.268
- No, but I did find this.
Sammy Logan's signature.

13:54.311 --> 13:56.661
- So Sammy was here
in the house with Roberto?

13:56.705 --> 13:58.489
- Yeah, means he lied too.

13:58.533 --> 13:59.882
Said he didn't know
where Roberto was staying.

13:59.926 --> 14:01.318
- Huh.

14:01.362 --> 14:02.885
- I just talked to a neighbor,
and he told me that

14:02.929 --> 14:04.844
he saw a person that matches
Sammy's description

14:04.887 --> 14:07.629
enter this house
around 10:00 p.m. last night.

14:09.631 --> 14:10.980
- All right, bring him in.

14:25.952 --> 14:29.303
- Damn it.
- You know, I gotta be honest.

14:29.346 --> 14:31.914
I'm still hoping Sammy
isn't good for this.

14:31.958 --> 14:33.960
Just doesn't feel
like a killer.

14:36.484 --> 14:38.094
- Wasn't that open before?

14:55.111 --> 14:57.853
Feel like a killer now?

14:58.985 --> 15:01.422
- Saw the sneakers that
we found at the church?

15:01.465 --> 15:02.466
- Yeah?

15:02.510 --> 15:03.946
- They're identical to Sammy's.

15:03.990 --> 15:06.035
And the sole pattern
and size are an exact match

15:06.079 --> 15:07.863
to the prints that we found
at the demo house.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.344
- All right, where we at
in Joe Mason's alibi?

15:10.387 --> 15:12.650
- We got three witnesses--
put him at a party

15:12.694 --> 15:14.043
same time as the murder.

15:14.087 --> 15:15.827
- Sammy Logan's starting
to look good for this.

15:15.871 --> 15:17.829
- Yeah, problem is,
we can't find him anywhere.

15:17.873 --> 15:19.135
We've been circulating photos
of him

15:19.179 --> 15:20.832
all over the neighborhood.
No one's seen him.

15:20.876 --> 15:22.530
- We've been checking
city shelter logs.

15:22.573 --> 15:23.835
He's been in and out of a few

15:23.879 --> 15:25.576
for the last two years.
Never stays.

15:25.620 --> 15:28.144
- Well, Sammy got some kind
of file or a case worker?

15:28.188 --> 15:29.929
- Yeah, over in Lincoln Park.
- All right.

15:29.972 --> 15:31.452
Get a subpoena
for his medical records,

15:31.495 --> 15:34.629
talk to the case worker,
see what you can find.

15:34.672 --> 15:37.588
- Sammy Logan.
Oh, yeah, I remember this kid.

15:37.632 --> 15:39.634
University of Chicago
law student.

15:39.677 --> 15:41.114
Then he got sick.

15:41.157 --> 15:44.030
Paranoid schizophrenia.
Early 20s, that's when it hits.

15:44.073 --> 15:45.814
- What about his family
or friends?

15:45.857 --> 15:48.425
- Looks like his mom died
when he was young,

15:48.469 --> 15:49.992
and he's estranged
from his father.

15:50.036 --> 15:52.386
- And what do you do for him?

15:53.691 --> 15:55.693
- Class is about to start.
Follow me.

15:55.737 --> 15:59.001
Well, we've given him a place
to live, a place to sleep,

15:59.045 --> 16:00.481
some career counseling.

16:00.524 --> 16:02.700
And in Sammy's case we mostly
work with the doctors

16:02.744 --> 16:04.137
to help keep him on his meds,

16:04.180 --> 16:06.835
but he was mostly noncompliant
in that department.

16:06.878 --> 16:08.880
He thinks the government's
trying to poison him

16:08.924 --> 16:10.404
so he won't take his pills.

16:10.447 --> 16:12.667
- So what do you think?
Is Sammy capable of violence?

16:12.710 --> 16:14.060
- No.

16:14.103 --> 16:15.800
Truth is, most paranoid
schizophrenics are meek.

16:15.844 --> 16:17.541
They're more inclined
to hide than fight.

16:17.585 --> 16:20.588
- Any idea where he might hide?
- Kid was a compulsive reader.

16:20.631 --> 16:22.155
I'd start
with the public libraries.

16:22.198 --> 16:23.591
- Thanks for your time.

16:23.634 --> 16:25.462
- Thank you.

16:25.506 --> 16:27.987
Hey, it's Upton.
Yo.

16:28.030 --> 16:29.814
- Hey, you still
in Lincoln Park?

16:29.858 --> 16:31.033
- Yeah.

16:31.077 --> 16:32.774
- Okay, I got a possible
sighting of Sammy.

16:32.817 --> 16:35.037
A patrol saw him getting out
of a used bookstore

16:35.081 --> 16:37.039
and walking into a field house
in Luna Park.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.736
They're keeping eyes on him
as we speak.

16:38.780 --> 16:39.999
- Okay, good.
We'll check it out.

16:40.042 --> 16:41.913
- All right.
Great.

16:43.741 --> 16:45.047
- What's up, Officer?

16:45.091 --> 16:46.570
Atwater, Rojas.
Intelligence.

16:46.614 --> 16:48.616
You got our guy?
- He's in there.

16:51.706 --> 16:53.012
- We got it from here.

16:53.055 --> 16:54.796
- Copy.
Got your back.

16:56.102 --> 16:58.930
- Sammy.
It's Vanessa.

16:58.974 --> 17:00.584
You sold me
that Harry Caray shirt.

17:00.628 --> 17:02.064
Everyone loves it, man.

17:02.108 --> 17:03.935
Whoa, whoa.
We just wanna talk.

17:03.979 --> 17:07.069
- Do I have to?
- No, you don't.

17:07.113 --> 17:08.679
How about we just take you down
to the station?

17:08.723 --> 17:10.116
Get you something nice to eat.
- I'm not hungry.

17:10.159 --> 17:11.595
- We just wanna talk.

17:11.639 --> 17:14.120
- 1846 Charlie,
what's your status?

17:15.817 --> 17:17.079
- Sammy!

17:19.908 --> 17:21.692
Sammy!

17:22.824 --> 17:23.955
Sammy, stop!

17:23.999 --> 17:25.783
- Stop running!

17:25.827 --> 17:26.915
- Sammy!

17:32.138 --> 17:33.661
- Stop!
Stop!

17:33.704 --> 17:35.184
Stop the car!
- Stop!

17:36.577 --> 17:37.969
Stop the bus!
- Sammy!

17:38.013 --> 17:39.971
- Open the door!

17:42.670 --> 17:44.150
- Sammy.
- Back off.

17:44.193 --> 17:45.760
- Hey, hey, hey--

17:45.803 --> 17:48.197
- Get off the bus!

17:48.241 --> 17:49.938
- Get down--Stay down!
- Sammy.

17:49.981 --> 17:51.766
- Throw the knife,
or I will shoot.

17:51.809 --> 17:53.507
- Lower your weapon.
I got this.

17:57.859 --> 18:00.644
Sammy.
Lower your weapon.

18:00.688 --> 18:01.993
I know you don't want
to hurt anybody.

18:02.037 --> 18:04.126
- I don't.
- That's good.

18:04.170 --> 18:06.911
So just drop the knife,
okay?

18:06.955 --> 18:08.826
- How do I know
you're not working for them?

18:08.870 --> 18:10.524
- That's a good question.

18:10.567 --> 18:12.700
But I'm not
really CIA material.

18:12.743 --> 18:15.006
I barely got out
of high school.

18:15.050 --> 18:16.791
Drop your knife.

18:16.834 --> 18:19.576
I'll take you somewhere safe.
I promise.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.240
You guys okay?

18:31.284 --> 18:33.634
Okay?
Sammy.

18:33.677 --> 18:35.853
You're okay.
Okay?

18:48.605 --> 18:50.607
- Go ahead, Sammy.
If you're hungry.

18:51.652 --> 18:53.393
- I'm not stupid.

18:53.436 --> 18:54.655
- No one thinks you're stupid.

18:56.309 --> 18:58.311
- Did you put ricin
in the mustard?

19:04.491 --> 19:06.014
- It's just mustard.

19:08.495 --> 19:11.672
- I get it.
You already took the antidote.

19:12.803 --> 19:16.503
Nice try, but you haven't
Mirandized me,

19:16.546 --> 19:18.505
so I gather
I'm not under arrest.

19:18.548 --> 19:20.637
- Correct.
We're just talking.

19:20.681 --> 19:23.249
- Just talking.

19:23.292 --> 19:25.555
- We wanna follow up
on Roberto Peña.

19:25.599 --> 19:27.340
You said you didn't know
where he was staying,

19:27.383 --> 19:29.646
but we found
one of your books there.

19:29.690 --> 19:31.213
- One of my books?

19:35.348 --> 19:37.132
Who's behind the mirror?

19:37.176 --> 19:38.612
- Nobody.

19:38.655 --> 19:40.614
It's just us.

19:40.657 --> 19:43.051
I promise.

19:48.143 --> 19:50.319
What the hell are you doing,
Hailey?

19:50.363 --> 19:51.799
- What?

19:51.842 --> 19:54.497
- I turned off the cameras
so we wouldn't record Sammy.

19:54.541 --> 19:58.501
We all agreed no recording.
That meant no cell phones.

19:58.545 --> 20:00.242
I can see it through
your pocket, Hailey.

20:00.286 --> 20:02.636
- All right, I'm sorry.
- Why don't you take five?

20:13.516 --> 20:15.388
- Okay, it's just us now.

20:17.390 --> 20:19.392
- I think Rojas enjoyed that.

20:25.702 --> 20:28.227
Have you been
inside this house?

20:29.576 --> 20:31.099
- Yeah.

20:31.142 --> 20:33.362
Roberto crashed there
sometimes.

20:34.537 --> 20:37.323
- When was the last time
you were there?

20:41.327 --> 20:43.503
- You found my shoes
back at the church?

20:43.546 --> 20:46.288
Is that what's going on?

20:46.332 --> 20:47.376
- Yes.

20:47.420 --> 20:49.552
- You think I killed Roberto?

20:49.596 --> 20:51.685
- I just wanna know
what happened.

20:51.728 --> 20:53.556
- I didn't kill Roberto.

20:53.600 --> 20:56.646
- But you were there
when he was murdered?

20:59.301 --> 21:00.476
What happened?

21:00.520 --> 21:03.479
- We were at
this abandoned house,

21:03.523 --> 21:04.915
and Roberto was getting high.

21:04.959 --> 21:07.570
Myself I don't put chemicals
in my body.

21:07.614 --> 21:10.573
I was in a room reading,

21:10.617 --> 21:13.620
and then I heard
the S.O. Five come in.

21:13.663 --> 21:15.796
- The--the S.O. Five?

21:15.839 --> 21:20.148
- There's this guy that
pretends to be a social worker.

21:20.191 --> 21:22.498
He took me and Roberto
out to coffee once,

21:22.542 --> 21:24.674
and I saw through
his whole act.

21:24.718 --> 21:26.415
He's a company man.

21:26.459 --> 21:28.635
- A company man?
You mean the CIA?

21:28.678 --> 21:31.638
- Special Op, level five,

21:31.681 --> 21:33.770
Latin American bureau.

21:33.814 --> 21:35.859
In Caracas,
if I had to guess.

21:37.774 --> 21:39.646
And the S.O. Five

21:39.689 --> 21:41.909
says that he wants
to take Roberto for a ride,

21:41.952 --> 21:44.781
and the next thing I know
I heard shoving,

21:44.825 --> 21:47.741
and I peeked through a hole
in the wall and...

21:50.265 --> 21:52.702
And he was

21:52.746 --> 21:55.314
stabbing Roberto.

21:57.403 --> 22:00.667
And I stayed hidden because
I didn't know what to do.

22:01.668 --> 22:04.453
I didn't know what he wanted.

22:04.497 --> 22:06.803
And, uh.

22:08.501 --> 22:10.459
I'm not a spy.

22:10.503 --> 22:12.374
I'm not a damn spy!

22:12.418 --> 22:13.941
- Sammy, just slow--slow down.

22:15.769 --> 22:17.945
I know you're not a spy.

22:19.294 --> 22:20.948
I know you're scared.

22:20.991 --> 22:22.471
Look at me.

22:22.515 --> 22:25.866
Everything's gonna be okay.
Trust me.

22:30.914 --> 22:33.874
- What did this man look like?

22:33.917 --> 22:35.832
- He was Latino.

22:35.876 --> 22:38.531
And he had glasses,

22:38.574 --> 22:40.620
and a goatee.

22:45.668 --> 22:47.627
- He puts himself
at the crime scene,

22:47.670 --> 22:50.499
knows details only
the killer would know.

22:50.543 --> 22:52.849
Maybe Roberto stole something
from Sammy.

22:52.893 --> 22:55.809
A T-shirt?
We know he was thief.

22:55.852 --> 22:57.854
And then Sammy catches him
at the abandoned house.

22:57.898 --> 22:59.769
They fight.
He grabs a knife.

22:59.813 --> 23:03.469
- Or maybe the spy
really did do it.

23:03.512 --> 23:05.035
Sammy was right
about the blue pickup,

23:05.079 --> 23:06.428
maybe he's right
about this too.

23:07.777 --> 23:10.301
- Hey, I just got off the horn
with CPIC.

23:10.345 --> 23:12.042
Some guy tried to cash
an SSI check

23:12.086 --> 23:13.870
in our homicide victim's name,
Robert Peña.

23:13.914 --> 23:16.264
- What?
Someone's pretending to be him?

23:16.307 --> 23:18.397
- When was this?
- This is 45 minutes ago

23:18.440 --> 23:19.876
at a currency exchange
in Homan Square.

23:19.920 --> 23:22.401
- I'll be damned.
Pause that.

23:22.444 --> 23:24.533
- That matches the guy
Sammy just described.

23:24.577 --> 23:25.839
- And it's a clear image too.

23:25.882 --> 23:28.972
Bet you a bourbon we get a hit
on facial rec.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.326
- Eduardo Salazar.

23:35.370 --> 23:37.851
Been on the run from Miami,
Florida since 2015.

23:37.894 --> 23:38.939
- What's he running from?

23:38.982 --> 23:40.767
- Double murder.
He killed a cop.

23:40.810 --> 23:43.509
He, uh, robbed a bank
in Dade County.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.033
Killed the clerk.

23:46.076 --> 23:47.556
Then he killed
the responding officer.

23:47.600 --> 23:50.690
- FBI been looking for
that dude for a long time.

23:50.733 --> 23:52.518
- Notice how Salazar
and Roberto look similar?

23:52.561 --> 23:53.649
- Hm.

23:53.693 --> 23:55.564
- Salazar hangs around
the homeless.

23:55.608 --> 23:57.044
He's looking for the right
physical match.

23:57.087 --> 23:58.611
He finds Roberto.

23:58.654 --> 24:00.961
Makes sure he doesn't have
any family or close friends.

24:01.004 --> 24:03.442
- And then slits his throat
and steals his identity.

24:03.485 --> 24:04.921
- We talk to the feds?

24:04.965 --> 24:06.880
- I spoke to the S-A-C
in the Miami Field Office.

24:06.923 --> 24:09.796
She's sending over files.
- They got any leads?

24:09.839 --> 24:11.798
- There was an anonymous tip
that Salazar was spotted

24:11.841 --> 24:14.017
in Homan Square,
but it came up dry.

24:14.061 --> 24:15.758
- Yeah, well, dry or not,

24:15.802 --> 24:17.804
this guy killed the police.
Let's find his ass.

24:19.893 --> 24:22.896
- Sarge, what are we gonna do
about Sammy?

24:22.939 --> 24:26.682
- Well, first see
if he can ID Salazar, then...

24:26.726 --> 24:29.468
let's do what
we can to help him.

24:34.690 --> 24:35.996
- That's him.

24:36.997 --> 24:38.607
The S.O. Five.

24:38.651 --> 24:41.001
Was he acting on orders?

24:41.044 --> 24:43.656
Oh, you can tell me.
I'm good with secrets.

24:45.745 --> 24:49.531
- Sammy, he's--
he's not a CIA agent.

24:49.575 --> 24:52.969
He's a really bad person
that robbed a bank,

24:53.013 --> 24:55.537
and killed two other people.

24:55.581 --> 24:57.974
- I saw him another time too.

24:58.018 --> 24:59.672
- Where?

24:59.715 --> 25:01.630
- In front of the church.

25:01.674 --> 25:05.721
He was hiding, but I knew
he was there looking for me.

25:05.765 --> 25:07.506
That's why I left.

25:07.549 --> 25:09.072
- But why would he
be looking for you?

25:09.116 --> 25:12.511
- Because he saw me
when he killed Roberto.

25:13.642 --> 25:16.689
- You said you--
you hid in that room

25:16.732 --> 25:18.865
and you were looking through
a hole in the wall.

25:18.908 --> 25:22.564
- I did, but after
a few minutes I ran out.

25:22.608 --> 25:25.393
That's when I think he saw me.

25:26.742 --> 25:28.657
Can I go now?

25:28.701 --> 25:29.919
- Yeah.

25:31.573 --> 25:35.011
An officer's gonna take you
to the hospital.

25:35.055 --> 25:36.839
- Which hospital?

25:36.883 --> 25:39.407
Is it Memorial?

25:39.450 --> 25:41.844
- Yes.
- Please don't take me there.

25:41.888 --> 25:44.455
They are not nice people.

25:44.499 --> 25:46.849
The doctors held me
in a basement

25:46.893 --> 25:48.547
because I wouldn't take
their poison.

25:48.590 --> 25:51.550
- We're taking you to Memorial.
We don't have a choice.

25:51.593 --> 25:54.117
It's the law.

25:54.161 --> 25:57.599
But I'm gonna come
and check in on you, okay?

25:57.643 --> 26:00.428
I'll make sure you're safe.

26:03.910 --> 26:05.607
- Thank you.

26:06.739 --> 26:08.436
Thank you.

26:13.267 --> 26:14.703
- Hey.

26:14.747 --> 26:16.836
That's good work.
You're real good with him.

26:16.879 --> 26:18.185
- You just gotta be patient

26:18.228 --> 26:21.492
and understand that his truth
is as real to him

26:21.536 --> 26:23.233
as yours is to you,
or mine is to me.

26:23.277 --> 26:24.583
- Yeah.

26:24.626 --> 26:26.062
I can tell you got
a lotta experience

26:26.106 --> 26:28.151
with people like Sammy.
- Yeah.

26:28.195 --> 26:30.806
When I was in the street...

26:30.850 --> 26:32.068
I, uh...

26:32.112 --> 26:35.071
I squatted in an
abandoned house with a woman.

26:35.115 --> 26:36.507
Her name was Nina.

26:38.901 --> 26:41.643
Yeah, she was sick like Sammy,

26:41.687 --> 26:43.863
but once she took her meds
she was fine.

26:43.906 --> 26:45.604
So we just gotta make sure
Sammy takes his.

26:47.170 --> 26:48.998
- Hey, we got a hit
off a CTA-cam

26:49.042 --> 26:50.609
near the cash exchange place.

26:50.652 --> 26:53.176
The camera has Salazar hopping
into a Chevy Monte Carlo.

26:53.220 --> 26:54.961
The car is registered
to a Liza Radley.

26:55.004 --> 26:56.527
- Who's that?
- Think it's his girlfriend

26:56.571 --> 26:57.659
who grew up in the same area
of Miami,

26:57.703 --> 26:58.834
went to the same
high school.

26:58.878 --> 26:59.922
- We got an address?
- Yeah.

26:59.966 --> 27:01.271
- She rents an apartment
on Belmont.

27:01.315 --> 27:02.751
Landlord says she lives
with her boyfriend.

27:02.795 --> 27:04.144
Boyfriend's description
matches Salazar's.

27:04.187 --> 27:06.102
- Hm.
- All right, when do we hit?

27:06.146 --> 27:08.104
- Waiting on a warrant.

27:17.723 --> 27:18.724
- Yeah.

27:18.767 --> 27:19.986
- Chicago PD!

27:22.728 --> 27:24.033
- Hey!
Stop!

27:24.077 --> 27:26.122
Get your hands up!
Hands on the table.

27:26.166 --> 27:28.081
Get your hands on the--
- Get off me, bitch!

27:28.124 --> 27:29.822
- Shut up and put your hands
on the table.

27:29.865 --> 27:32.215
- You Liza Radley?
- Yeah.

27:32.259 --> 27:33.956
- We're looking for your
boyfriend Eduardo Salazar.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.132
You cooperate,
you got a shot at freedom.

27:36.176 --> 27:37.786
You don't,
you're gonna spend

27:37.830 --> 27:39.222
the rest of your life in
prison.

27:39.266 --> 27:41.094
- Hands behind your back.

27:47.970 --> 27:50.233
- She lawyered up and spit
in my face for good measure.

27:50.277 --> 27:51.452
- All right,
anything on her phone?

27:51.495 --> 27:53.149
- Salazar texted her
a few hours ago,

27:53.193 --> 27:54.585
and then he shut his phone off.

27:54.629 --> 27:56.457
The text says,
"Chasing more Roberto paper.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.241
We almost there, baby.
Punta Mita soon."

27:58.285 --> 28:00.243
- Punta Mita?
- It's a beach town in Mexico.

28:00.287 --> 28:02.419
- Sounds like he's getting
his new identity in order

28:02.463 --> 28:04.204
then making a run
to the border.

28:04.247 --> 28:05.858
- All right, so keep monitoring
the phone.

28:05.901 --> 28:07.598
Let's get a couple of cars down
here in case he comes home.

28:07.642 --> 28:09.426
And check
all nearby businesses.

28:09.470 --> 28:11.428
Anywhere he could be setting up
a new identity.

28:11.472 --> 28:12.952
I know it's a needle
in a haystack,

28:12.995 --> 28:14.431
but it's worth a shot.

28:14.475 --> 28:16.956
- I got an idea.
- Okay.

28:18.479 --> 28:21.090
- And you said the S.O. Five
took you and Roberto

28:21.134 --> 28:22.396
out for coffee?

28:23.658 --> 28:26.008
Do you remember the name
of the place?

28:26.052 --> 28:28.445
- It's called
the Daily Groundup.

28:28.489 --> 28:30.491
- And that's in Pilsen?
- Yeah.

28:32.101 --> 28:35.148
So, Vanessa,
can you get me out of here?

28:35.191 --> 28:37.672
Let's make a call.

28:37.716 --> 28:40.327
Or something.
It's not safe.

28:40.370 --> 28:43.722
They got cameras
in the  toothbrushes.

28:43.765 --> 28:46.507
And like I was saying before...

28:49.118 --> 28:50.554
They're trying to poison me.

29:00.826 --> 29:03.306
- You need to take these pills,
Sammy.

29:03.350 --> 29:05.091
It'll make you feel better.

29:07.354 --> 29:09.486
Look, I gotta go.

29:09.530 --> 29:11.575
But I'll tell you what.

29:11.619 --> 29:13.229
I'll test these pills,

29:13.273 --> 29:17.016
and if they come back clean,
will you take one for me?

29:19.453 --> 29:21.455
- Yeah.

29:21.498 --> 29:23.326
- Good.

29:25.546 --> 29:26.721
I, uh...

29:29.071 --> 29:30.551
I talked to the doctors, uh--

29:30.594 --> 29:32.683
they said it's okay
if I give you a phone.

29:32.727 --> 29:36.383
My number's in there.
You call me anytime, okay?

29:38.689 --> 29:40.213
- I'm...

29:42.824 --> 29:45.044
I'm making sense, right?

29:47.742 --> 29:49.048
- You are.

29:51.224 --> 29:54.575
You've helped us narrow down
the search.

29:54.618 --> 29:56.055
You did that.

29:58.753 --> 30:00.581
I'll be back, okay?

30:13.289 --> 30:15.161
I got the name
of the coffee shop.

30:15.204 --> 30:17.250
Maybe Salazar's hanging out
in that area.

30:17.293 --> 30:19.600
- Good work.
I'll call Voight.

30:21.123 --> 30:22.255
- Coffee shop's a bust.

30:22.298 --> 30:23.647
He could be halfway
to Mexico by now.

30:23.691 --> 30:26.868
- Or he could still be here
chasing paper.

30:26.912 --> 30:28.609
We keep canvassing.

30:29.871 --> 30:31.786
How's Kim?

30:31.830 --> 30:33.570
- Uh, she's pretty good
I think.

30:33.614 --> 30:36.747
Trying to give her space.
Leave her alone.

30:36.791 --> 30:38.488
- What about you?

30:39.576 --> 30:41.752
How you doing?

30:41.796 --> 30:43.667
- You know, I don't think
I really processed it.

30:43.711 --> 30:44.886
I spent all this time

30:44.930 --> 30:46.845
trying to wrap my head
around having a kid,

30:46.888 --> 30:49.282
and I'm trying to wrap my head
around not having a kid,

30:49.325 --> 30:50.805
so I don't know.

30:52.459 --> 30:54.461
- You need any time off,
you let me know, okay?

30:54.504 --> 30:56.811
- Thanks, boss.
- 5021.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.421
You got your ears on?

30:58.465 --> 31:01.250
- 5021, go with your traffic.
- Got a hit on your BOLO.

31:01.294 --> 31:04.427
Wanted vehicle is parked
at 8771 South Pulaski.

31:04.471 --> 31:06.255
Patrol is standing by.
- Copy.

31:06.299 --> 31:08.649
We're close.
Let's bury this prick.

31:16.831 --> 31:18.572
Voight.
Intelligence.

31:18.615 --> 31:20.487
- It's right down there.
I walked by the car.

31:20.530 --> 31:22.837
It's empty.
- Huh.

31:27.711 --> 31:30.149
There's Salazar.
Fan out.

31:31.324 --> 31:32.716
- Gun!

31:32.760 --> 31:34.631
Get these people out of
the way!

31:34.675 --> 31:35.676
- Go!

31:39.941 --> 31:41.943
- I got eyes.

31:44.728 --> 31:46.295
Stay down, sir.
Stay down.

31:59.961 --> 32:01.702
Four cars up.

32:04.226 --> 32:05.401
- Red truck.

32:09.536 --> 32:11.668
Behind the truck.

32:11.712 --> 32:14.236
- Sarge, heads up!

32:14.280 --> 32:15.542
You're right on top of him!

32:15.585 --> 32:17.631
He's right behind that
red truck you're next to!

32:17.674 --> 32:18.806
I'm moving up!

32:23.550 --> 32:25.465
- Salazar!
Drop the gun!

32:25.508 --> 32:27.336
Put the gun down.
I'll put one in your head!

32:27.380 --> 32:29.382
- Don't you move.

32:35.344 --> 32:37.216
- EMT says he's stabilized.

32:37.259 --> 32:39.522
- So less paperwork.

32:39.566 --> 32:41.524
- Looks like he was getting
a passport photo.

32:41.568 --> 32:43.004
- Listen.

32:43.048 --> 32:45.485
I want you to get a statement
from the store.

32:45.528 --> 32:47.008
Make sure all
our bases are covered.

32:47.052 --> 32:49.010
Understand?
- You got it.

32:49.054 --> 32:51.578
- Sarge, I got a problem.
- What's up?

32:51.621 --> 32:54.233
- My witness Sammy just
took off from the hospital.

32:54.276 --> 32:55.712
The staff said
he was spinning out.

32:55.756 --> 32:58.280
I gave him a cell phone,
but he turned it off.

32:58.324 --> 33:00.021
I know I'm supposed to help
with the paper,

33:00.065 --> 33:01.718
but he could be a danger
to himself.

33:01.762 --> 33:03.372
- You get a read
on where he went?

33:03.416 --> 33:05.374
- No, but there's a good chance
he went back to that church

33:05.418 --> 33:07.550
he likes to stay at.
He thinks it's safe.

33:07.594 --> 33:09.726
- All right,
do what you gotta do.

33:17.908 --> 33:19.823
- Thanks, man.
Hailey.

33:19.867 --> 33:22.826
Dude saw Sammy an hour ago
with our vet, Alex.

33:22.870 --> 33:24.828
- Hey, Alex, right?
- Where's Sammy?

33:24.872 --> 33:26.308
- I take it you're not here
for mass.

33:26.352 --> 33:27.962
- We're looking for him.
- Well, I hope you find him.

33:28.006 --> 33:29.833
He ran out of here
with my friend's gun.

33:29.877 --> 33:31.313
- He has a gun?
- He was sure

33:31.357 --> 33:33.315
someone was gonna kill him.
Like, in that second.

33:33.359 --> 33:34.882
- So you let him walk away
with a gun?

33:34.925 --> 33:36.275
- Sure did.
It's loaded.

33:36.318 --> 33:38.146
Didn't want to get shot
in the face.

33:38.190 --> 33:39.800
- Thanks.

33:39.843 --> 33:41.497
- I'ma keep looking.
You don't have to come with.

33:41.541 --> 33:42.977
Shift's over.

33:43.021 --> 33:44.239
- No, I'm good.
It's not like I got a hot date,

33:44.283 --> 33:45.371
Rojas--Grubhub can wait.

33:45.414 --> 33:46.850
- Platt.

33:46.894 --> 33:48.765
Sammy turned his phone back on
15 minutes ago.

33:48.809 --> 33:50.811
We got an address.
Book depository on Clark.

33:50.854 --> 33:51.986
- Let's go.

33:56.773 --> 33:58.732
Ready?

34:09.221 --> 34:10.918
- Sammy?

34:16.228 --> 34:17.968
Sammy.

34:31.112 --> 34:34.028
Sammy.
It's Vanessa.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.508
You in here?

34:41.035 --> 34:42.993
"Every person--"
- Sammy!

34:43.037 --> 34:44.778
People are looking for you,
buddy.

34:44.821 --> 34:46.388
- Back off, lady!
- Hey!

34:47.607 --> 34:49.826
I need you to lower
your weapon.

34:49.870 --> 34:51.437
It's Vanessa, remember?
- I said back off.

34:51.480 --> 34:53.395
- Okay. I'm backing up.

34:53.439 --> 34:56.050
- I don't wanna hurt you.
- I know you don't.

34:56.094 --> 34:58.400
I need you to put
the gun on the ground,

34:58.444 --> 35:00.141
and let's talk, yeah?

35:01.316 --> 35:04.276
We got the bad guy.
The S.O. Five.

35:04.319 --> 35:06.278
You're safe.
- You're a liar.

35:06.321 --> 35:08.497
You're listening to my thoughts
with your phone,

35:08.541 --> 35:10.456
and that is very, very rude.

35:10.499 --> 35:13.502
- You're right.
I'll turn it off.

35:15.243 --> 35:17.811
There you go.
I'm sorry.

35:17.854 --> 35:19.465
I wanna buy another T-shirt.

35:19.508 --> 35:21.119
- Someone took them.

35:21.162 --> 35:23.033
- That's terrible.

35:23.077 --> 35:24.296
Let's get out of here.

35:24.339 --> 35:26.036
I'll help you find
your T-shirts.

35:26.080 --> 35:28.256
But first I need you
to put the gun on the floor.

35:28.300 --> 35:29.431
- See?

35:29.475 --> 35:30.867
They're here for me!

35:30.911 --> 35:32.086
- Sammy, Sammy!

35:32.130 --> 35:34.132
- Sammy, drop your weapon now!

35:34.175 --> 35:36.134
Sammy--

35:39.180 --> 35:42.052
Sammy--Sammy!

35:42.096 --> 35:43.837
There he is!
Move!

35:46.013 --> 35:47.057
- Sammy, stop!

35:47.884 --> 35:49.408
Sammy!

35:52.454 --> 35:54.152
- I'll run around back!
- I'll clear the front!

35:58.591 --> 35:59.853
Get out.

36:01.463 --> 36:04.205
I'm with Chicago PD.
I need you to move.

36:04.249 --> 36:06.425
Guys, get out of the store now.

36:08.514 --> 36:10.255
Ma'am.
Out.

36:15.216 --> 36:16.522
Get out.

36:26.227 --> 36:27.620
Sammy.

36:30.405 --> 36:32.320
I'm not gonna hurt you.

36:32.364 --> 36:33.582
I need you to give me that gun.

36:33.626 --> 36:35.410
- Why'd you leave me
in that terrible place?

36:35.454 --> 36:37.499
Why would you do that?
- I'm sorry.

36:37.543 --> 36:39.327
That's my bad, dude.

36:39.371 --> 36:41.373
Let's go out and talk, yeah?

36:43.201 --> 36:44.637
- How the hell did you find me?

36:44.680 --> 36:47.335
- Sir, get back!

36:47.379 --> 36:49.946
Sammy, please!
- You will not hurt me.

36:49.990 --> 36:51.557
- Sammy, no, don't do this!
- You will not hurt me!

36:51.600 --> 36:52.558
Aah!

36:52.601 --> 36:54.299
- No!

36:54.342 --> 36:55.909
- Police!

36:55.952 --> 36:57.563
- I got you, buddy.
I got you.

36:57.606 --> 36:59.608
Get the gun!
Get the gun!

37:07.486 --> 37:09.401
You will not die, okay?
I got you.

37:09.444 --> 37:10.619
I got you.

37:10.663 --> 37:11.968
- 5021 Henry.
Shots fired by the police.

37:12.012 --> 37:13.318
Roll an ambo
to 112 North Harding.

37:13.361 --> 37:15.189
We've got a man down.
GSW to the chest.

37:15.233 --> 37:17.147
Hey, look at me.
I'm gonna go meet the ambo.

37:17.191 --> 37:18.540
Keep pressure.
It's gonna be fine, okay?

37:18.584 --> 37:20.412
Keep pressure.

37:20.455 --> 37:23.197
- Look at me.
Look at me.

37:23.241 --> 37:26.156
You will not die.
I got you.

37:26.200 --> 37:28.420
You're okay.

37:30.552 --> 37:32.598
We find the gun?
- No.

37:34.339 --> 37:36.384
- He had it.
I mean, we saw it.

37:36.428 --> 37:38.952
He started shooting
in that book depository.

37:38.995 --> 37:40.475
- I know, he must've dropped it
during the chase.

37:40.519 --> 37:43.130
- I couldn't just let him shoot
that man and his daughter.

37:43.173 --> 37:45.175
I had no choice, Hailey.
- Listen.

37:46.438 --> 37:49.702
It was a good shoot, okay?

37:49.745 --> 37:51.051
You did what you had to do.

37:51.094 --> 37:52.400
Do not start second-guessing
yourself.

37:52.444 --> 37:53.575
Okay?
Do you hear me?

37:57.057 --> 37:58.363
Okay.
It's Jay.

37:58.406 --> 38:00.016
He spoke to the docs
at ICU.

38:00.060 --> 38:01.714
Sammy's doing much better.
He's stabilized.

38:01.757 --> 38:03.063
- Kay, what's that mean?

38:03.106 --> 38:05.587
- It means that
he's got a chance, okay?

38:05.631 --> 38:07.285
Let's go find that gun.
Come on.

38:07.328 --> 38:10.505
- No need.
Patrol officer just found it.

38:10.549 --> 38:12.115
- A .9?

38:15.815 --> 38:18.121
- Why don't you go home?
Get some rest.

38:20.036 --> 38:22.125
That's an order.
- Kay.

38:28.784 --> 38:31.613
- So where'd they find it?

38:31.657 --> 38:34.224
Patrol looked everywhere
Sammy had run.

38:34.268 --> 38:37.315
- I just told patrol to recheck
the alley behind the place.

38:37.358 --> 38:39.752
I guess they got lucky.

38:41.406 --> 38:42.711
- Hm.

38:43.669 --> 38:45.018
- Let's get outta here.

38:54.332 --> 38:55.507
- Excuse me.
Sorry.

38:55.550 --> 38:57.073
Officer Rojas.

38:57.117 --> 38:58.640
I'm looking for a patient.
Sammy Logan.

38:58.684 --> 39:01.208
He's a gunshot vic.

39:01.251 --> 39:03.341
Officer involved shooting
in Pilsen.

39:03.384 --> 39:05.038
- You mean the John Doe?

39:05.081 --> 39:07.040
- No, I mean Sammy Logan.
That's his name.

39:07.083 --> 39:09.521
- Sorry, we didn't find
any identification on him.

39:09.564 --> 39:11.566
- What room is he in?

39:28.670 --> 39:30.716
Hi, Sammy.

39:38.332 --> 39:42.423
I brought you something
for--for when you wake up.

40:01.529 --> 40:03.836
- Hey.

40:03.879 --> 40:06.142
How you feel?

40:08.188 --> 40:09.624
- Great.

40:10.886 --> 40:12.497
- Have a seat.

40:15.804 --> 40:18.416
Listen, we just got a lead on
that guy in Bridgeport

40:18.459 --> 40:19.547
moving fentanyl.

40:19.591 --> 40:22.202
- Jimmy Hassett?
- That's the one.

40:22.245 --> 40:24.247
- What's the lead?
- Well, it turns out

40:24.291 --> 40:26.554
his girlfriend works
at a restaurant called Luna.

40:26.598 --> 40:28.121
Word is she likes to drink,
too.

40:28.164 --> 40:29.470
Could be our access point.

40:29.514 --> 40:30.863
I thought you'd be
a good person

40:30.906 --> 40:33.387
to take the lead on this.

40:33.431 --> 40:34.736
You know just
start working her,

40:34.780 --> 40:35.781
hang out at the
restaurant,

40:35.824 --> 40:37.435
get to know her,
maybe grab a drink--

40:37.478 --> 40:39.132
- Sarge, stop.

40:39.175 --> 40:40.481
I know what you're doing...

40:45.443 --> 40:47.445
And I appreciate it.

40:56.192 --> 40:57.890
- There's no rush, okay?

40:57.933 --> 40:59.848
Whenever you're ready.

41:03.983 --> 41:05.767
- Thank you.
