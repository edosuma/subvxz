00:17.090 --> 00:18.957
- Robin, look at me.
- No!

00:18.963 --> 00:21.131
Robin. No, no, no, no!

00:21.137 --> 00:22.904
No!

00:22.910 --> 00:24.677
Robin, do you know where you are?

00:24.683 --> 00:26.151
- Help me.
- Her symptoms,

00:26.185 --> 00:27.452
they're not consistent

00:27.486 --> 00:29.120
with a psychiatric disorder.

00:29.155 --> 00:30.288
A tumor?

00:30.322 --> 00:31.723
So I was crazy.

00:31.757 --> 00:33.458
Your dad's hardly left your side.

00:35.494 --> 00:37.162
His name is Jack Kellogg.

00:37.196 --> 00:39.564
Behavior indicates a
malignant narcissist.

00:39.598 --> 00:40.965
He threaten to hurt anybody?

00:41.000 --> 00:42.333
Is Dr. Charles ready to see me?

00:42.368 --> 00:44.069
He had a family emergency.

00:44.103 --> 00:46.838
Tell him that I'm not going
to be treated this way.

00:46.872 --> 00:49.225
- Dr. Charles.
- Mr. Kellogg?

00:53.651 --> 00:55.638
Daniel. You secured the gun?

00:55.644 --> 00:56.944
- Yes, ma'am.
- Check him.

00:56.950 --> 00:58.983
Daniel. Daniel, I'm here.

00:59.018 --> 01:00.552
- Oh, God.
- It's okay.

01:00.586 --> 01:02.214
It's okay.

01:02.220 --> 01:04.022
Do you know who I am?

01:04.056 --> 01:05.857
Uh, Sharon.

01:05.891 --> 01:07.826
Yes, yes. Do you know where you are?

01:07.860 --> 01:10.662
- Uh, Med.
- Yes, that's right.

01:10.696 --> 01:12.530
- That's right.
- He's alive.

01:12.565 --> 01:14.732
But heavy scalp bleeding.

01:17.470 --> 01:18.670
What the hell happened?

01:18.704 --> 01:20.004
He got shot in the abdomen.

01:20.039 --> 01:21.840
- He's lost a lot of blood.
- Baghdad.

01:21.874 --> 01:23.341
No, we're going straight to the OR.

01:23.375 --> 01:25.076
Tell them we're on our way up.

01:26.946 --> 01:29.778
Hang on, Daniel. Stay with me.

01:30.416 --> 01:32.750
We're going to take good
care of you, Dr. Charles.

01:32.785 --> 01:35.286
Stay with me, Daniel.

01:47.066 --> 01:48.488
So, it's been a few months.

01:48.494 --> 01:50.073
How are you feeling overall?

01:50.533 --> 01:53.902
You know, pretty good.
Really, pretty good.

01:53.908 --> 01:55.260
I might get a little tired towards

01:55.266 --> 01:56.492
the end of the day, but uh...

01:56.498 --> 01:59.089
You could have taken
a little bit more time off.

01:59.095 --> 02:00.723
I was going nuts.

02:01.846 --> 02:03.621
How are you doing emotionally?

02:05.242 --> 02:07.118
Hey, who's the shrink here?

02:08.530 --> 02:10.945
I'm doing fine, thank you.
Thank you for asking.

02:11.390 --> 02:13.693
So you had some pain when
I palpated your abdomen.

02:13.727 --> 02:16.496
So I'd like you to get a CT
and a CBC with white count

02:16.530 --> 02:18.460
and make sure that you
don't have an abscess.

02:18.466 --> 02:19.785
Can't do it today.

02:19.791 --> 02:21.968
It's actually Jack Kellogg's trial,

02:22.002 --> 02:24.263
and I'm testifying. Oh, crap.

02:25.072 --> 02:26.739
Boy. Guy could've died.

02:26.774 --> 02:29.130
It would've made everybody's
life a little easier, huh?

02:32.357 --> 02:34.314
Please tell Robin that I'm truly sorry

02:34.348 --> 02:36.352
that I can't be there
when you bring her home.

02:36.358 --> 02:37.725
Yeah, sure.

02:37.731 --> 02:40.366
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Not a worry.

02:42.733 --> 02:44.801
Dr. Reese, Dr. Charles left,

02:44.835 --> 02:46.603
said you should do rounds without him.

02:46.609 --> 02:47.761
He doesn't know when they're

02:47.767 --> 02:49.037
gonna call him in to testify.

02:49.043 --> 02:50.707
It is awful he has to relive that night.

02:50.741 --> 02:52.442
- Yeah. Right.
- As long as it helps

02:52.476 --> 02:53.677
put that schmuck away.

02:53.711 --> 02:55.212
The hubris, trying to get off

02:55.246 --> 02:57.510
- with an insanity plea.
- Yes.

02:58.482 --> 03:00.016
It's ironic, isn't it?

03:00.353 --> 03:02.854
By saving lives, we put
our own in jeopardy.

03:02.860 --> 03:04.327
- I guess.
- You know,

03:04.361 --> 03:05.995
nothing's been done to improve security.

03:06.029 --> 03:07.463
We need a police presence here,

03:07.498 --> 03:09.533
both inside and outside the E.D.

03:09.539 --> 03:11.073
I'm all for cops, Dr. Stohl,

03:11.335 --> 03:13.336
but the people you most
need to worry about,

03:13.370 --> 03:15.252
they're not afraid of guns.

03:15.258 --> 03:16.690
Which reminds me, what do you

03:16.696 --> 03:17.912
want to about your gunshot,

03:17.941 --> 03:19.509
- Mr. Jameson?
- The wound is through

03:19.543 --> 03:20.732
and through, not serious.

03:20.738 --> 03:22.116
He needs some in-home care,

03:22.145 --> 03:23.279
but there's no reason for him

03:23.285 --> 03:24.418
to be taking up space here.

03:24.448 --> 03:26.483
- Discharge him.
- All right.

03:27.679 --> 03:28.998
Hey.

03:29.629 --> 03:31.773
- Natalie!
- Hi.

03:32.434 --> 03:33.901
We thought we lost you for good.

03:33.935 --> 03:35.936
Why? It was just a little sabbatical.

03:35.971 --> 03:37.705
We didn't hear from
you for three months.

03:37.739 --> 03:39.511
I'm sorry. I should have called.

03:39.517 --> 03:41.308
I just got caught up with family stuff.

03:41.343 --> 03:42.811
Dr. Halstead.

03:43.411 --> 03:45.579
Look who decided to come back.

03:45.945 --> 03:47.343
Hey, Nat.

03:47.349 --> 03:49.062
Hey.

03:50.185 --> 03:52.219
Good to see you.

03:52.383 --> 03:53.783
- You too.
- Uh-oh.

03:53.789 --> 03:55.878
You're gonna have to catch up later.
Incoming.

03:57.626 --> 03:59.823
Welcome home.

04:02.434 --> 04:04.335
Brian Cutler, early 40s.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.236
High speed crash, prolonged extrication,

04:06.271 --> 04:08.005
unresponsive, unable to intubate.

04:08.039 --> 04:10.207
- You're going to Trauma 3.
- GCS 5,

04:10.241 --> 04:11.842
heart rate 78, BP is 120 over palp.

04:11.876 --> 04:14.198
- His wife is right behind us.
- Natalie, take the husband?

04:14.245 --> 04:15.908
- Doris, Noah with me.
- Yep.

04:15.942 --> 04:18.067
- Brian. Brian.
- Judith Cutler,

04:18.072 --> 04:19.507
- GCS 15, vitals stable.
- My husband, Brian.

04:19.541 --> 04:22.007
- Seatbelt sign on her right neck.
- Go to trauma one.

04:22.012 --> 04:23.991
It's okay. He's being treated.
I'm Dr. Halstead.

04:23.997 --> 04:25.690
- I said terrible things.
- I'm going to take good care of you.

04:25.696 --> 04:26.968
- Oh, God. Brian.
- Monique, let's go.

04:26.994 --> 04:28.620
On my count, one, two, three.

04:28.891 --> 04:30.791
All right, Doris, take over bagging.

04:30.797 --> 04:33.741
I need to intubate.
100 of sux, 20 of etomidate.

04:33.781 --> 04:36.650
- FAST him, Dr. Sexton.
- Yes, ma'am.

04:36.684 --> 04:38.819
And also I need a chest x-ray.

04:38.853 --> 04:40.987
Yes, Doctor, flying in.

04:45.626 --> 04:47.284
All right.

04:49.731 --> 04:53.367
We were fighting.
He didn't see the other car.

04:53.888 --> 04:55.769
Mrs. Cutler, are you always this hoarse?

04:55.803 --> 04:57.371
What? Uh, no.

04:57.405 --> 04:58.772
That seatbelt sign.

05:00.141 --> 05:01.708
Chest wall tenderness.

05:01.743 --> 05:03.443
Hey, I want a 4-vessel CT angiogram

05:03.478 --> 05:05.445
with laryngeal cuts and a CT c-spine,

05:05.480 --> 05:06.613
chest, abdomen, pelvis.

05:06.647 --> 05:07.981
Right.

05:08.015 --> 05:10.183
Help Brian. The things I said...

05:10.218 --> 05:12.783
I didn't mean them.
Have to tell him I'm sorry.

05:12.789 --> 05:13.958
Don't worry. We're taking good

05:13.964 --> 05:15.327
care of him. You'll see him soon.

05:15.356 --> 05:16.968
FAST is clear.

05:16.974 --> 05:18.341
I'm in.

05:26.796 --> 05:28.190
Chest is clear.

05:28.196 --> 05:31.198
All right, let's send him
up to CT for a panscan.

05:38.045 --> 05:40.814
You have to tell him. Have to tell him

05:40.848 --> 05:43.049
- All right.
- Have to tell him.

05:46.421 --> 05:47.661
You'll still experience some

05:47.667 --> 05:48.994
symptoms of the encephalitis

05:49.023 --> 05:50.924
but to a lesser and lesser degree.

05:50.958 --> 05:53.193
- What kind of symptoms?
- Memory loss,

05:53.199 --> 05:55.028
phonemic paraphasia: Substituting "Ken"

05:55.062 --> 05:56.530
for "pen," that kind of thing.

05:56.737 --> 05:58.171
You might also experience

05:58.177 --> 05:59.842
sleep issues, hypersomnia.

05:59.848 --> 06:01.949
Impulsivity, disinhibition,

06:01.955 --> 06:03.122
irritability.

06:03.180 --> 06:04.656
Sounds great, huh?

06:04.739 --> 06:06.273
Look, nothing a vintage bottle

06:06.307 --> 06:08.241
of Clicquot can't fix, right?

06:08.276 --> 06:11.339
Champagne? No. Alcohol is
definitely contraindicated.

06:11.345 --> 06:12.977
You'll still be on Prednisone, Ativan,

06:12.983 --> 06:14.485
Geodon, Trileptal, and Labetalol,

06:14.515 --> 06:16.349
and you'll be receiving
bi-weekly at-home

06:16.383 --> 06:18.484
- immunoglobulin infusions.
- Nice.

06:18.519 --> 06:20.586
Can I get some of that?

06:20.621 --> 06:23.623
Thank you, Sarah. I get the picture.

06:23.657 --> 06:25.773
Okay. I'll check in with you.

06:29.339 --> 06:30.976
You know what would make me

06:30.982 --> 06:32.738
feel better than champagne?

06:38.925 --> 06:40.625
I'm with you.

06:40.631 --> 06:42.637
Yeah, sorry, we can't lock the door.

06:42.643 --> 06:44.944
Well, we'll be home
in a couple of hours.

06:44.978 --> 06:46.878
Yeah, but who wants to wait?

06:47.665 --> 06:49.534
Yeah.

06:53.387 --> 06:55.021
Dr. Manning.

06:55.055 --> 06:56.456
It's good to have you back.

06:56.490 --> 06:58.858
Thanks, Ms. Goodwin. Glad to be back.

07:03.263 --> 07:04.797
Sent the husband for a panscan.

07:04.832 --> 07:07.533
- Wife's getting a CT, too.
- Good.

07:09.937 --> 07:11.571
Enjoy your sabbatical?

07:11.605 --> 07:12.805
Yeah.

07:12.840 --> 07:14.031
It's good to get away,

07:14.037 --> 07:15.838
gives you perspective on things.

07:15.844 --> 07:17.312
Oh, yeah?

07:17.425 --> 07:18.925
There was a lot going on here.

07:18.931 --> 07:20.567
I had a lot to think about.

07:27.554 --> 07:29.355
Hey, Sarah. Ha ha.

07:29.389 --> 07:31.324
Where you going? I got us some sliders.

07:31.358 --> 07:32.957
Courthouse. I want to be there

07:32.963 --> 07:34.881
- when Dr. Charles testifies.
- Oh, right, right.

07:34.887 --> 07:36.488
I get it. Moral support.

07:36.522 --> 07:38.189
Yeah, he's the reason
I went into psychiatry.

07:38.224 --> 07:39.691
Dr. Charles taught me everything I know.

07:39.725 --> 07:41.293
Yeah, he's kind of like
your dad getting shot.

07:41.327 --> 07:42.839
My dad? Okay, my dad. I have not

07:42.845 --> 07:44.256
seen my dad since I was six.

07:44.262 --> 07:45.552
There's no comparison

07:45.558 --> 07:47.058
between him and Dr. Charles.

07:51.161 --> 07:53.195
Dr. Charles, can you identify the man

07:53.201 --> 07:54.844
who shot you the night of May 11th?

07:54.874 --> 07:56.741
Uh, yes. He's sitting

07:56.776 --> 07:58.877
right there, Jack Kellogg.

07:58.911 --> 08:01.646
We're all very grateful you
pulled through, Dr. Charles.

08:01.924 --> 08:03.391
There's certainly no one
here would blame you

08:03.397 --> 08:06.181
for wanting to see Mr. Kellogg
pay for the physical and

08:06.187 --> 08:07.810
emotional distress he's caused you.

08:09.522 --> 08:12.390
Now, just a few weeks
before Mr. Kellogg shot you,

08:12.425 --> 08:15.026
- he'd been a patient of yours, right?
- Yes.

08:15.061 --> 08:17.429
And at that time,

08:17.463 --> 08:19.898
his actions and his behavior

08:19.932 --> 08:21.666
warranted enough concern to place him

08:21.701 --> 08:24.402
on a 72-hour psychiatric hold
for further observation.

08:24.437 --> 08:27.105
- That's right.
- So you were aware

08:27.350 --> 08:29.418
that Mr. Kellogg was a
severely troubled man?

08:29.512 --> 08:31.514
Yes. Yes, I was.

08:32.111 --> 08:34.011
The jury's already heard testimony

08:34.046 --> 08:35.380
from some other experts who claim

08:35.385 --> 08:37.135
that Mr. Kellogg's mental state

08:37.140 --> 08:38.642
does not meet the threshold

08:38.648 --> 08:40.816
of what would be
considered legally insane.

08:40.822 --> 08:43.188
But they weren't able to evaluate him

08:43.222 --> 08:45.023
until well after the incident, correct?

08:45.057 --> 08:46.424
That's correct.

08:46.459 --> 08:48.059
And they weren't there in the moment

08:48.094 --> 08:49.394
when Mr. Kellogg shot you and

08:49.400 --> 08:52.030
- then himself, were they?
- No. They were not.

08:52.064 --> 08:54.032
Then would you say

08:54.066 --> 08:56.801
they're qualified to
evaluate Mr. Kellogg?

08:56.836 --> 08:59.471
No. In fact, I wouldn't.

08:59.895 --> 09:02.207
With all due respect to my colleagues,

09:02.241 --> 09:06.452
I feel that I am uniquely
qualified to answer

09:06.812 --> 09:08.380
the question at hand which is

09:08.609 --> 09:11.502
what was Jack Kellogg's mental state

09:11.508 --> 09:14.052
at the time that he fired those bullets.

09:14.086 --> 09:15.920
And I believe

09:15.955 --> 09:17.589
that he was legally insane

09:17.623 --> 09:19.157
at that time.

09:19.191 --> 09:21.059
So, in your expert medical opinion...

09:21.093 --> 09:22.896
I think that Jack Kellogg should be

09:22.902 --> 09:25.168
declared not guilty by
reason of insanity.

09:28.952 --> 09:30.412
Thank you, Dr. Charles.

09:34.807 --> 09:36.274
Hey.

09:36.308 --> 09:38.343
Why would you perjure yourself up there?

09:38.547 --> 09:40.081
I didn't perjure myself.

09:40.087 --> 09:42.781
You said that Jack Kellogg
is legally insane.

09:42.815 --> 09:44.249
We both evaluated him,

09:44.283 --> 09:45.984
and we concurred that
he was, and I quote,

09:46.018 --> 09:48.620
"a malignant narcissist with
overt sadistic impulses."

09:48.654 --> 09:50.822
Toxic, yes, and in definite
need of treatment,

09:50.856 --> 09:52.257
but not something that rises

09:52.291 --> 09:53.525
to the definition of legal insanity.

09:53.559 --> 09:55.593
Sarah, I revised my diagnosis.

09:55.628 --> 09:57.295
Why? And why didn't you tell me?

09:57.329 --> 09:59.364
Because Mr. Kellogg began to present

09:59.398 --> 10:02.200
with definitive signs of
dissociation and paranoia.

10:02.234 --> 10:04.556
In other words, after he shot me,

10:04.680 --> 10:05.914
it occurred we might have missed

10:05.920 --> 10:07.621
some underlying psychotic disorder.

10:07.627 --> 10:09.528
You said he hid the gun in his pocket.

10:09.562 --> 10:10.921
Concealing it alone suggest

10:10.927 --> 10:12.436
an awareness of impropriety.

10:12.465 --> 10:14.603
You want to know why I didn't
tell you? It's cause of this.

10:15.335 --> 10:16.802
You're emotional about the shooting.

10:16.836 --> 10:19.271
And while I very much appreciate

10:19.305 --> 10:20.806
the sentiment behind that, really I do,

10:20.840 --> 10:22.774
I also think it's affected
your objectivity.

10:22.809 --> 10:25.202
Objectivity? You think
you're being objective?

10:25.208 --> 10:27.061
Look, I got to get back
in there for cross.

10:27.067 --> 10:28.881
You know how you can help me?

10:28.915 --> 10:30.849
Go back to the hospital
and treat patients.

10:30.884 --> 10:32.618
Okay? I'll be back at
the end of the day,

10:32.652 --> 10:34.228
and we'll talk some more.

10:38.585 --> 10:39.999
It started a couple of weeks ago

10:40.005 --> 10:41.539
with a headache and next thing I know

10:41.545 --> 10:43.279
he's fiery like a furnace.

10:43.678 --> 10:44.780
101.

10:44.786 --> 10:46.943
Hey, Ryan, I'm Dr. Choi.

10:46.949 --> 10:48.783
So I hear this has been
going on a few weeks?

10:48.818 --> 10:50.952
I know I should have
brought him in sooner.

10:50.986 --> 10:53.521
I got laid off last year,
and we lost our coverage.

10:53.556 --> 10:55.223
Everything is out-of-pocket right now,

10:55.257 --> 10:56.958
so until I'm working again...

10:56.992 --> 10:58.593
Sorry about this, Mom.

10:58.627 --> 11:01.129
Honey, I told you there is
nothing to be sorry about.

11:01.163 --> 11:03.631
It's okay, Ryan. Dr. Choi
will fix you right up.

11:03.666 --> 11:05.967
- April, let's get a CBC, CMP.
- Oh, no.

11:06.001 --> 11:07.735
Not again.

11:10.806 --> 11:13.039
Also start him on fluids.

11:13.484 --> 11:15.276
And Doris, grab some towels.

11:15.311 --> 11:17.879
- Let's clean this up, okay?
- Yeah.

11:26.655 --> 11:29.124
So I picked up roast
chicken and some hummus,

11:29.158 --> 11:31.159
unless you want to unpack first?

11:31.193 --> 11:33.061
I got a better idea.

11:38.334 --> 11:40.335
- I guess lunch can wait.
- Mm-hmm.

11:48.043 --> 11:49.310
Okay, good news.

11:49.345 --> 11:51.179
Abdomen and pelvis scans were clean.

11:51.213 --> 11:53.515
Your laryngeal CT did
indicate some mild swelling,

11:53.549 --> 11:54.849
but your arteries look good.

11:54.884 --> 11:56.751
No damage to the major vessels.

11:58.487 --> 12:00.288
Hi.

12:00.322 --> 12:01.523
Hey.

12:01.557 --> 12:02.991
Mrs. Cutler, I'm Dr. Manning.

12:03.025 --> 12:04.926
I've been treating your husband Brian.

12:04.960 --> 12:07.362
- Can I see him?
- He's still unconscious.

12:07.396 --> 12:10.331
The panscan showed his spine,
chest, and belly were clear.

12:10.366 --> 12:11.945
However, his head CT showed

12:11.951 --> 12:14.769
diffuse bilateral
intraparenchymal bleeding.

12:15.053 --> 12:17.388
I'm afraid we're talking
about a bleed in the brain.

12:17.463 --> 12:18.673
Oh, God.

12:18.707 --> 12:20.808
This is not something we
can resolve surgically.

12:20.843 --> 12:22.810
So we've taken your husband to the ICU.

12:22.845 --> 12:25.613
The hope is that we can
control the bleeding

12:25.648 --> 12:27.482
and the pressure enough
so that he will wake up.

12:27.516 --> 12:29.284
He has to.

12:29.318 --> 12:30.885
Please, I...

12:30.920 --> 12:32.787
I have to tell him I'm sorry.

12:32.821 --> 12:35.790
I said such horrible things.

12:35.824 --> 12:37.559
Mrs. Cutler, since you're still hoarse,

12:37.593 --> 12:40.061
I've just paged the ENT
to scope your larynx

12:40.095 --> 12:41.754
just to make sure there's no damage to

12:41.760 --> 12:43.636
your vocal chords.
As soon as we do that,

12:43.666 --> 12:45.133
we're gonna take you up
to see your husband.

12:45.167 --> 12:47.602
Thank you. Thank you.

12:51.607 --> 12:53.975
What was that all about?
Tell him she's sorry?

12:54.629 --> 12:56.121
Yeah. they were having a fight

12:56.127 --> 12:57.568
when the accident occurred.

12:57.746 --> 13:00.203
She's afraid she won't
get the chance to...

13:00.916 --> 13:02.750
Tell him how she really feels.

13:11.961 --> 13:14.162
Were you aware that
Dr. Charles was testifying

13:14.196 --> 13:16.764
- in Kellogg's defense?
- I found out today.

13:16.799 --> 13:18.421
Dr. Charles wants him remanded

13:18.427 --> 13:19.939
to a psychiatric facility.

13:19.969 --> 13:21.603
Which means he won't go to jail.

13:21.637 --> 13:23.330
That's absurd. The man came here and

13:23.336 --> 13:25.106
tried to kill a medical
health professional

13:25.140 --> 13:26.507
because he wanted attention.

13:26.542 --> 13:28.276
Well, I'm as upset as you are.

13:28.310 --> 13:30.845
I'm the one who found him
bleeding on the sidewalk.

13:30.879 --> 13:33.715
Jack Kellogg is a devious sociopath.

13:33.749 --> 13:35.917
He'll con his way out
of a mental institution

13:35.951 --> 13:38.386
and be back on the streets.
We have a responsibility,

13:38.420 --> 13:39.687
a public responsibility,

13:39.722 --> 13:41.222
to make sure that doesn't happen.

13:41.257 --> 13:42.523
Unfortunately, Dr. Reese,

13:42.558 --> 13:44.559
there's nothing you or I can do.

13:44.593 --> 13:46.313
It's up to the jury.

13:50.833 --> 13:52.934
Help! He can't breathe.

13:52.968 --> 13:55.470
Heart rate's spiking, statting at 88%.

13:55.504 --> 13:57.305
- Get him on oxygen.
- Got it.

14:00.309 --> 14:02.076
All right, breath sounds
diminished on the left.

14:02.111 --> 14:04.208
- Give me the ultrasound.
- Yes, Doctor.

14:06.168 --> 14:08.803
Hey, hey. Why don't we
wait outside, okay?

14:08.809 --> 14:10.343
Left side's full of fluid.

14:10.389 --> 14:11.957
Let's give him four
morphine and two of versed.

14:11.991 --> 14:13.792
We need to get in a chest tube now.

14:15.153 --> 14:17.216
Lidocaine?

14:34.013 --> 14:36.433
- Need the tube, now!
- Got it.

14:44.274 --> 14:46.909
Stats are coming up. He's stabilizing.

14:47.141 --> 14:49.204
April, let's get a blood
sample for cultures,

14:49.442 --> 14:51.443
and Doris, when you finish
taping the tube in place,

14:51.459 --> 14:52.871
get that pus off the wall before

14:52.877 --> 14:54.774
environmental services has a fit.

14:57.312 --> 14:58.679
I'm sick of this.

14:58.685 --> 15:00.185
Getting stuck with the dirty work.

15:00.211 --> 15:01.578
Cleaning up pus and vomit

15:01.613 --> 15:04.114
- while you get to run labs.
- What?

15:04.149 --> 15:07.170
Just 'cause you and Ethan
are sleeping together.

15:07.936 --> 15:10.287
Excuse me?

15:20.065 --> 15:21.699
Mr. Wilson.

15:21.733 --> 15:23.367
A little short of breath?

15:23.401 --> 15:24.835
Afraid so.

15:25.564 --> 15:27.931
- Let's get him on a nasal cannula.
- Yes, Doctor.

15:28.513 --> 15:30.757
Dr. Bardovi, the patient's cardiac index

15:30.763 --> 15:33.210
is 1.8 by Fick. What would you suggest?

15:33.244 --> 15:34.487
Increase dobutamine from 3

15:34.701 --> 15:36.118
to 4 to improve cardiac output.

15:36.147 --> 15:37.614
Correct.

15:37.649 --> 15:40.517
Mr. Wilson, we'll be back
to check on you later.

15:40.552 --> 15:42.986
Thank you, Dr. Latham.

15:45.323 --> 15:47.524
So, any thoughts?

15:47.559 --> 15:49.893
Normal presentation of
non-compaction syndrome.

15:49.928 --> 15:51.995
The patient's in
non-ischemic heart failure.

15:52.030 --> 15:53.831
- And?
- With his tachycardia,

15:53.865 --> 15:55.632
we can't increase inotropic support

15:55.667 --> 15:57.401
without risking cardiogenic shock.

15:57.435 --> 15:58.958
That gives us, at best,

15:58.964 --> 16:00.804
a few more days to find him a new heart.

16:00.839 --> 16:02.685
Unfortunately, yes.

16:03.408 --> 16:04.708
Carry on.

16:07.445 --> 16:08.812
Dr. Bekker.

16:08.847 --> 16:11.515
Busy day. How are we progressing?

16:11.851 --> 16:13.218
I completed my valve replacement,

16:13.253 --> 16:14.853
triple bypass is being prepped now,

16:14.888 --> 16:16.155
and Dr. Rhodes' pulmonary thrombectomy

16:16.189 --> 16:17.556
is set for this afternoon.

16:17.562 --> 16:19.370
Robin was discharged this morning.

16:19.376 --> 16:21.778
Dr. Rhodes will be here as
soon as he gets her settled.

16:21.784 --> 16:23.752
You know, Dr. Latham, I'm thinking

16:24.030 --> 16:25.497
my bypass patient is stable.

16:25.532 --> 16:27.466
In fact, he could probably
use another day or two

16:27.500 --> 16:29.334
- for his heart to rest.
- And?

16:29.369 --> 16:32.204
Pulmonary thrombectomy,
that's a difficult procedure.

16:32.238 --> 16:34.306
With everything Dr. Rhodes
is dealing with today,

16:34.340 --> 16:36.075
I could take some of the pressure off

16:36.109 --> 16:37.940
and perform his thrombectomy.

16:37.946 --> 16:39.796
With your permission, of course.

16:41.281 --> 16:43.148
That's very considerate of you.

16:43.183 --> 16:44.917
We're a team.

16:44.951 --> 16:46.707
Hm.

16:48.054 --> 16:50.522
Yes. Take the thrombectomy.

16:50.557 --> 16:52.796
I'm sure Dr. Rhodes will appreciate it.

16:58.131 --> 17:00.933
Oh, come... do you really have to go?

17:00.967 --> 17:02.802
It's a pulmonary thrombectomy.

17:02.808 --> 17:04.541
It's not something you see every day.

17:04.548 --> 17:06.415
That's a high-profile case.

17:06.638 --> 17:09.708
Did you have to wrestle Cruella for it?

17:09.742 --> 17:11.410
Ava Bekker?

17:11.444 --> 17:14.346
No, it hasn't quite come to that yet.

17:14.380 --> 17:16.702
- You want to wrestle with me?
- Ohh...

17:16.708 --> 17:21.204
Well, that is very, very tempting.

17:21.869 --> 17:23.738
But I really do have to go.

17:23.743 --> 17:26.279
- Come on, it will be quick.
- No.

17:26.285 --> 17:28.027
I wish I could.

17:29.295 --> 17:32.264
You know, I never understood
why women in movies

17:32.298 --> 17:34.199
have sex on kitchen tables.

17:34.234 --> 17:38.137
It just... it seems so
uncomfortable to me, but...

17:38.171 --> 17:39.718
I don't know.

17:39.724 --> 17:41.825
Maybe we ought to try it.

17:41.831 --> 17:44.866
See what we've been
missing out on, right?

17:50.003 --> 17:51.598
What's the matter?

17:53.999 --> 17:56.302
I shouldn't be late tonight.

18:01.196 --> 18:02.747
Connor.

18:04.197 --> 18:07.152
You'd tell me if something
were wrong, wouldn't you?

18:07.337 --> 18:09.277
Robin, don't worry.

18:19.345 --> 18:21.411
Maggie. I need some help here.

18:21.427 --> 18:22.860
Barry, what's going on?

18:22.895 --> 18:24.762
Dr. Stohl discharged this patient.

18:24.789 --> 18:26.649
Mr. Jameson, are you okay?
What happened?

18:26.774 --> 18:28.683
- Nothing.
- I couldn't leave him at home.

18:28.689 --> 18:30.222
- Why not?
- First off,

18:30.257 --> 18:31.557
his brother was supposed to be there

18:31.591 --> 18:32.959
to take care of him. He wasn't.

18:32.993 --> 18:35.054
Couldn't get away from work
so he's coming tomorrow.

18:35.060 --> 18:36.562
Number two, there's guys hanging around

18:36.596 --> 18:39.358
waiting to pop him again.
He needs his brother as back-up.

18:39.364 --> 18:41.584
- For real.
- Garfield Park.

18:42.536 --> 18:44.116
And there's no place else for you to

18:44.122 --> 18:45.658
go until your brother gets there?

18:46.456 --> 18:47.637
But...

18:49.380 --> 18:51.548
Okay, 24 hours.

18:52.012 --> 18:53.279
That's all you have, okay?

18:53.313 --> 18:55.472
- I'll be back for him tomorrow.
- You better be.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.996
- Could use something to eat.
- What?

19:03.497 --> 19:06.298
Hey, Reese, I need to ask you something.

19:06.456 --> 19:09.591
You mentioned disinhibition, impulsivity

19:09.626 --> 19:11.526
as things that Robin might experience.

19:11.561 --> 19:13.395
Can you get a little
more specific for me?

19:13.429 --> 19:16.218
Impulse buying, gambling,

19:16.224 --> 19:17.704
maybe hypersexuality,

19:17.734 --> 19:19.668
- hyperphagia...
- Hypersexuality?

19:19.702 --> 19:21.536
Are you concerned about Robin?

19:21.571 --> 19:23.272
Yeah, of course I'm concerned.

19:23.306 --> 19:25.274
You're sure that she was
ready to be discharged?

19:25.308 --> 19:27.743
- Yes.
- You're confident about that?

19:27.777 --> 19:30.112
I am, and if my opinion
isn't good enough,

19:30.146 --> 19:32.180
her neurologist and internist
both concurred, okay?

19:32.215 --> 19:33.715
I am trying to figure out

19:33.750 --> 19:35.550
if I'm dealing with Robin
or her antibodies here.

19:35.585 --> 19:36.657
Look, if you're not up to

19:36.663 --> 19:39.041
- managing her care, we can find...
- I am.

19:44.087 --> 19:45.623
I'll talk to my husband about that and

19:45.629 --> 19:47.246
we'll see if we can do it on Thursday.

19:47.280 --> 19:49.120
- Beth, where're you going?
- We've got a case.

19:49.126 --> 19:50.519
Oh, they gave it to another team.

19:50.525 --> 19:52.626
The patient's already in surgery.

19:55.639 --> 19:56.772
Dr. Latham.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.477
The pre-op team said

19:58.483 --> 19:59.650
that my pulmonary thrombectomy

19:59.656 --> 20:01.802
was already taken to surgery.
I don't understand.

20:01.808 --> 20:04.093
Dr. Bekker kindly offered
to take the case. I okayed it.

20:04.127 --> 20:05.581
Why?

20:06.296 --> 20:08.197
With Robin's discharge this morning,

20:08.232 --> 20:09.799
Dr. Bekker thought you'd be relieved

20:09.833 --> 20:11.701
to have such a difficult
procedure taken off your plate.

20:11.735 --> 20:14.036
Really? How considerate of her.

20:14.042 --> 20:15.571
Ah, that's what I said.

20:15.606 --> 20:17.873
It's gratifying, Dr. Rhodes,

20:17.908 --> 20:20.122
to see the two of you
working so well together.

20:20.128 --> 20:21.396
Yeah.

20:26.009 --> 20:28.410
Dr. Choi, Ryan's labs came back.

20:28.445 --> 20:30.612
White count of 16,000 with a left shift,

20:30.647 --> 20:32.815
plus bicarbs are up... He's dehydrated.

20:32.849 --> 20:34.283
Let's give him another liter of fluid

20:34.317 --> 20:36.085
and check on his gram stain.

20:36.119 --> 20:37.437
Um...

20:38.521 --> 20:41.123
Doris thinks we're sleeping together.

20:41.157 --> 20:42.637
She does?

20:42.643 --> 20:44.110
Did you say something?

20:44.116 --> 20:46.284
- No.
- Ethan.

20:46.290 --> 20:47.858
April.

20:47.864 --> 20:50.165
I swear I didn't say a word.

20:50.349 --> 20:51.849
Hey, if it's out, great.

20:51.855 --> 20:53.856
No, don't.

20:54.037 --> 20:55.504
Come on.

20:55.538 --> 20:57.339
Why do we have to keep sneaking around?

20:57.373 --> 20:59.908
Because you're a doctor. I'm a nurse.

20:59.943 --> 21:01.610
Not the first time this ever happened.

21:01.644 --> 21:03.011
Exactly.

21:03.046 --> 21:05.755
I do not want to be that cliché.

21:06.382 --> 21:08.851
Is that what you think of us?

21:08.885 --> 21:10.206
No.

21:11.054 --> 21:12.754
But other people will.

21:12.789 --> 21:14.237
Who cares?

21:14.243 --> 21:15.606
That's really easy for you to

21:15.612 --> 21:17.480
say 'cause you're the doctor.

21:17.894 --> 21:21.196
Someone help my son!

21:21.231 --> 21:23.832
Somebody help my son.

21:26.336 --> 21:28.370
He's having a seizure.
April, push 2 of Ativan.

21:28.404 --> 21:30.472
On it, 2 of Ativan.

21:37.914 --> 21:39.725
He's burning up. We need to get

21:39.731 --> 21:41.657
him upstairs for a head CT now.

21:44.654 --> 21:47.389
- April, let's move.
- Okay, here we go.

21:47.423 --> 21:49.691
What is happening to my son?

21:49.726 --> 21:52.361
Ma'am, I promise you,
we're going to find out.

21:56.432 --> 21:58.400
Intracranial pressure's way up.

21:58.434 --> 21:59.868
Henry, 5 of morphine.

21:59.903 --> 22:01.336
BP's spiking.

22:01.371 --> 22:03.405
Heart rate's down to 42.

22:03.439 --> 22:05.407
Cushing's response.

22:05.441 --> 22:07.242
Give him another 70 of Mannitol.

22:07.277 --> 22:08.485
Will, his pupils are blown.

22:08.491 --> 22:10.678
Run a *** and hyperventilate him.

22:10.684 --> 22:13.219
Will, we've lost him.

22:15.271 --> 22:17.306
Damn it.

22:23.126 --> 22:24.426
We maxed out on his meds.

22:24.460 --> 22:26.094
There was nothing we could do.

22:26.129 --> 22:27.596
I know.

22:27.630 --> 22:29.331
- Dr. Manning.
- Yeah?

22:29.365 --> 22:30.699
I understand you just lost a patient

22:30.733 --> 22:32.067
to an intraparenchymal bleed.

22:32.101 --> 22:33.402
Yes, Brian Cutler.

22:33.436 --> 22:35.103
And we're about to inform his wife.

22:35.138 --> 22:38.507
Ah, well, there's something
I need you to ask her.

22:49.986 --> 22:52.298
Can I go see my husband now?

22:53.323 --> 22:56.959
Mrs. Cutler, I'm afraid we
have some very bad news.

22:56.993 --> 22:59.928
- Your husband.
- Oh, my God...

23:00.814 --> 23:03.799
We were unable to control
the bleeding in his brain.

23:03.833 --> 23:06.101
He suffered what we call herniation.

23:06.135 --> 23:09.744
That's when pressure on the
brain cuts off blood supply.

23:10.478 --> 23:12.474
Brian is...

23:12.864 --> 23:14.543
He's brain dead.

23:14.577 --> 23:17.145
Unfortunately, it's irreversible.

23:17.180 --> 23:19.775
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

23:19.947 --> 23:21.617
We're very sorry.

23:21.651 --> 23:24.486
But I... I never told him...

23:24.520 --> 23:27.322
- No... no...
- Mrs. Cutler.

23:27.357 --> 23:29.391
We know this is a terrible time for you,

23:29.425 --> 23:31.994
but we need to ask.

23:32.028 --> 23:35.230
Your husband was not
registered as an organ donor.

23:35.265 --> 23:36.832
This can't be happening.

23:36.866 --> 23:38.767
There's a young man in this hospital

23:38.801 --> 23:40.156
who needs your husband's heart,

23:40.162 --> 23:41.547
but we need your consent.

23:41.553 --> 23:43.272
Brian.

23:43.306 --> 23:45.107
Mrs. Cutler,

23:45.141 --> 23:47.743
your husband's heart will
save this young man's life,

23:47.777 --> 23:49.678
and the sooner we act, the better.

23:51.781 --> 23:54.117
May we have your permission?

23:55.551 --> 23:57.961
- Yes.
- Thank you.

24:11.534 --> 24:13.717
- This is my case.
- Was your case.

24:13.748 --> 24:15.816
- And I don't need to your assistance.
- And you open him up?

24:15.850 --> 24:18.071
I had him scheduled
for interventional radiology.

24:18.077 --> 24:19.578
To resect a saddle embolus?

24:20.021 --> 24:21.989
No, that would have been a great idea

24:22.023 --> 24:23.991
if you were trying to kill him.

24:24.025 --> 24:26.202
You poached my case and now
you changed the procedure.

24:26.208 --> 24:28.716
Dr. Rhodes. Outside now.

24:28.722 --> 24:30.589
Please.

24:40.420 --> 24:42.655
I can make better use of
your time than kibitzing

24:42.689 --> 24:44.156
- with Dr. Bekker
- Dr. Latham...

24:44.191 --> 24:45.925
She is eminently skilled and qualified

24:45.959 --> 24:47.129
to perform the thrombectomy.

24:47.135 --> 24:48.761
- Yeah.
- We have a patient

24:48.795 --> 24:50.029
in cardiac failure.

24:50.063 --> 24:51.564
A heart has just been procured

24:51.598 --> 24:53.766
for transplantation, but it presents

24:53.800 --> 24:55.447
a significant size mismatch.

24:55.453 --> 24:57.344
So you will have to
completely reconstruct

24:57.350 --> 24:58.784
both the in and outflow tracks.

24:58.790 --> 25:01.471
No. You will have to reconstruct them.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.201
It's your case.

25:17.237 --> 25:19.705
Dr. Charles, prosecution's
calling a rebuttal witness.

25:19.711 --> 25:22.073
What do I need to know
about Sarah Reese?

25:23.041 --> 25:24.284
What?

25:29.903 --> 25:31.304
Tell me your own resident

25:31.338 --> 25:33.698
isn't here to poke holes
in your testimony.

25:40.539 --> 25:43.106
So you also treated the
defendant, Mr. Kellogg.

25:43.141 --> 25:45.391
- Yes, I did.
- Dr. Reese,

25:45.501 --> 25:48.337
is it safe to say that you
disagree with Dr. Charles?

25:51.063 --> 25:52.416
Yes.

25:53.512 --> 25:55.792
We want to believe

25:55.798 --> 25:58.245
that the only thing that can explain

25:58.265 --> 26:01.399
aberrant behavior is
some sort of insanity.

26:01.405 --> 26:04.074
But even in my short time
as a psychiatric resident,

26:04.108 --> 26:06.576
I've found that that's
not always the case.

26:06.610 --> 26:09.779
And it is certainly not the
case with Mr. Kellogg.

26:09.814 --> 26:10.914
- Lying bitch!
- Sit down.

26:10.948 --> 26:12.315
You're a lying bitch.

26:12.349 --> 26:14.050
Deputies restrain the defendant.

26:14.085 --> 26:16.252
Let me go. You're a liar. A damn liar!

26:16.287 --> 26:18.088
- Mr. Kellogg control yourself!
- Let go!

26:18.122 --> 26:19.823
You're a liar!

26:19.857 --> 26:21.624
- Order in this court!
- You'll pay for this.

26:21.659 --> 26:22.854
Get off of me.

26:22.860 --> 26:24.260
Get off of me.

26:24.644 --> 26:25.844
Off of me.

26:25.850 --> 26:27.751
You're a liar!

26:27.757 --> 26:29.624
Let go of me. Get off of me!

26:29.834 --> 26:32.368
You're a liar, damn it!

26:34.171 --> 26:36.940
Ryan has an infection in his brain?

26:36.974 --> 26:38.475
It's called a subdural abscess.

26:38.509 --> 26:40.777
He contracted an infection,
and as it spread,

26:40.811 --> 26:43.446
a small collection of pus was
walled-off inside his brain.

26:43.481 --> 26:45.181
How does this happen?

26:45.216 --> 26:47.450
We're hoping you might be
able to help us answer that.

26:47.485 --> 26:49.519
Mrs. Potter, can you
think of anywhere Ryan

26:49.553 --> 26:52.335
may have been exposed
to a fungus or parasite?

26:52.341 --> 26:53.708
Did Ryan go camping?

26:53.714 --> 26:55.291
Possibly swimming in a lake or river.

26:55.326 --> 26:56.759
No. Nothing like that.

26:56.794 --> 26:58.131
Any dental work?

26:58.137 --> 27:00.805
We haven't been to the dentist in ages.

27:01.031 --> 27:04.067
Never. It's too expensive.

27:10.040 --> 27:12.609
Severe tooth decay on
the left posteriors.

27:12.643 --> 27:15.145
Small abrasion on the
surface of the gums.

27:15.179 --> 27:16.817
Could have allowed bacteria to enter the

27:16.823 --> 27:18.372
bloodstream and travel to his brain.

27:18.378 --> 27:19.678
Am I going to be okay?

27:19.684 --> 27:21.317
We'll start you on antibiotics,

27:21.352 --> 27:22.652
but you'll likely need surgery

27:22.686 --> 27:23.987
to drain the abscess.

27:24.021 --> 27:26.122
I'll get you a referral
for an oral surgeon.

27:26.157 --> 27:27.669
How could this happen?

27:27.675 --> 27:30.010
He never even complained of a toothache.

27:36.500 --> 27:39.702
Mr. Jameson, why are you still here?

27:39.737 --> 27:41.983
Uh, there was an issue.

27:46.043 --> 27:48.578
- Maggie.
- Yes.

27:48.612 --> 27:51.147
Why is Mr. Jameson sipping
on a juice box in my E.D.?

27:51.182 --> 27:52.849
He couldn't be left at home.

27:52.883 --> 27:54.851
Maggie, we are not running a hotel here.

27:54.885 --> 27:57.086
But if he goes home by himself,

27:57.121 --> 27:58.588
he could get shot again.

27:58.622 --> 28:00.857
However unfortunate
that situation may be,

28:00.891 --> 28:02.358
it is not our problem.

28:02.393 --> 28:04.861
We treat 'em, we street 'em.
That's what we do.

28:04.895 --> 28:06.496
Treat 'em and street 'em is fine

28:06.530 --> 28:08.364
for people who live on your street.

28:08.399 --> 28:09.532
Not his.

28:09.567 --> 28:11.381
- Maggie, I'm not...
- Dr. Stohl.

28:11.387 --> 28:12.889
You're rightfully concerned about

28:12.895 --> 28:14.442
someone getting shot in the E.D.

28:14.471 --> 28:16.039
but what about the people who live

28:16.073 --> 28:18.241
with that kind of thing every day?

28:18.275 --> 28:20.276
I cannot correct society's ills.

28:20.311 --> 28:21.793
I patch people up.

28:21.799 --> 28:24.185
Now discharge Mr. Jameson.

28:41.632 --> 28:44.687
So you got plans tonight?
You and Dr. Choi?

28:44.789 --> 28:46.423
Why you trying to start something?

28:46.458 --> 28:47.991
Am I wrong, April?

28:48.026 --> 28:49.993
You're not sleeping together?

28:50.028 --> 28:52.896
Yes, you're wrong.

28:56.794 --> 28:58.594
Don't blame my mom.

28:58.600 --> 29:00.267
She didn't know.

29:00.273 --> 29:01.973
It was just a toothache.

29:01.979 --> 29:04.213
I shouldn't have kept it a secret.

29:04.219 --> 29:05.986
Just a toothache?

29:06.277 --> 29:08.011
I can't imagine how much that hurt.

29:08.046 --> 29:10.280
She's always worried about money.

29:10.315 --> 29:12.282
I didn't want to worry her more.

29:12.317 --> 29:14.318
- It's my fault.
- No.

29:14.352 --> 29:16.820
You did what you thought was best.

29:23.620 --> 29:26.055
I know what you're thinking.

29:26.061 --> 29:28.262
About secrets.

29:28.700 --> 29:31.461
All I'm thinking is
that's one brave kid.

29:32.666 --> 29:34.390
Our secret...

29:35.722 --> 29:37.895
It's up to you, April.

29:38.314 --> 29:40.148
I want you to be comfortable.

29:49.320 --> 29:51.155
You said you'd keep him 24 hours.

29:51.189 --> 29:52.990
The Chief of Department said no.

29:53.024 --> 29:55.325
- You have to go home.
- He's helpless.

29:55.360 --> 29:56.860
They'll kill him.

29:56.895 --> 29:58.207
What do you want me to do?

29:59.301 --> 30:00.802
Maggie.

30:00.808 --> 30:03.810
Bring the patient over here.

30:11.910 --> 30:14.975
You feel that?

30:15.062 --> 30:16.732
Yeah.

30:18.216 --> 30:19.957
Push your foot against my hand.

30:23.541 --> 30:25.409
Can you feel that now?

30:28.626 --> 30:30.894
Um, no.

30:32.564 --> 30:34.531
I suspect there may be nerve damage

30:34.566 --> 30:35.832
we didn't pick up earlier.

30:35.867 --> 30:37.434
I'd like to admit Mr. Jameson

30:37.468 --> 30:40.070
for inpatient physical and
occupational therapy.

30:44.372 --> 30:46.269
Hm.

30:55.787 --> 30:57.521
Robin. Hey, you okay?

30:57.555 --> 31:00.468
Yeah, I was thinking about
this afternoon and...

31:01.241 --> 31:03.031
You just seemed...

31:05.136 --> 31:06.704
I don't know.

31:07.098 --> 31:09.248
Everything's good with us right?

31:09.934 --> 31:12.202
Uh, yeah, everything's good.

31:12.237 --> 31:14.037
So, I'm just being paranoid.

31:14.072 --> 31:15.272
Do you know what, never mind.

31:15.306 --> 31:17.094
Don't... don't answer that.

31:17.809 --> 31:21.829
Um, if you want I could look
pasta for dinner tonight.

31:23.579 --> 31:24.945
You mean "cook"?

31:26.398 --> 31:28.232
Cook, yes.

31:28.238 --> 31:30.026
Cook pasta.

31:30.855 --> 31:32.589
Honey.

31:32.624 --> 31:34.218
Are you taking your meds?

31:34.224 --> 31:36.579
Yes, I'm taking my meds. Wha...

31:38.871 --> 31:41.173
I'll be home before long, okay?

31:42.318 --> 31:44.197
Okay.

31:51.491 --> 31:53.526
I hear you one-upped me.

31:54.045 --> 31:56.613
Heart transplant with a
significant size mismatch.

31:56.648 --> 31:58.649
That looks good on the CV.

31:58.683 --> 32:00.017
Guess you have me to thank,

32:00.051 --> 32:01.852
taking that thrombectomy off your hands.

32:01.886 --> 32:04.321
Ava, I'm really not in the mood.

32:05.948 --> 32:08.449
You should go home and get some sleep.

32:18.273 --> 32:20.740
Oh, there you are Dr. Reese.

32:20.774 --> 32:23.974
You'll be happy to know that
Mr. Kellogg was found guilty.

32:24.612 --> 32:27.981
I'm not happy, but I am
satisfied with that verdict.

32:28.015 --> 32:30.016
He'll still receive treatment in jail.

32:30.050 --> 32:31.684
Through the Department of Corrections?

32:31.719 --> 32:33.620
You have any idea what
their success rate is?

32:33.654 --> 32:34.875
In that environment?

32:34.881 --> 32:37.690
His chances of rehabilitation
are practically nil.

32:37.725 --> 32:39.659
Not that it really matters,
because more than likely

32:39.693 --> 32:41.861
his temper will get him
killed within a week.

32:41.895 --> 32:43.463
Those outburst are an act

32:43.497 --> 32:45.465
calculated to convince you he's crazy.

32:45.499 --> 32:47.039
Is that what he was doing?

32:48.035 --> 32:50.270
Dr. Reese, I've been evaluating

32:50.304 --> 32:52.272
psychiatric patients for
more than 30 years.

32:52.306 --> 32:53.964
Is it conceivable to you that

32:53.970 --> 32:55.513
I might have more insight

32:55.542 --> 32:58.446
into his behavior than you do?

32:58.463 --> 32:59.830
Daniel.

32:59.836 --> 33:02.738
Give us a moment, Dr. Reese.

33:09.104 --> 33:11.238
Daniel.

33:11.702 --> 33:13.336
You recruited her

33:13.527 --> 33:15.528
because you liked that
she thought for herself.

33:15.562 --> 33:17.563
Don't hold that against her now.

33:17.598 --> 33:19.966
Sharon, Kellogg is not a criminal.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.169
He's a confused guy in a lot
of pain who needs some help.

33:23.203 --> 33:24.504
Like someone else I know.

33:24.538 --> 33:26.072
What's that supposed to mean?

33:26.106 --> 33:27.573
Look, I didn't say anything

33:27.608 --> 33:29.976
when you insisted upon returning to work

33:30.010 --> 33:32.712
before you were cleared
to, because I got it.

33:32.746 --> 33:35.381
It was important to reclaim your agency.

33:35.416 --> 33:39.419
But now here you are,
the one person in Chicago

33:39.453 --> 33:41.487
willing to champion the cause

33:41.522 --> 33:43.489
of the man who tried to kill you.

33:43.495 --> 33:46.144
I got to say, it concerns me.

33:46.150 --> 33:49.095
Why? 'Cause I want to
send him to an asylum?

33:49.129 --> 33:51.664
Not a day spa, instead of a prison?

33:51.699 --> 33:53.433
Because I want... I want
to treat his illness

33:53.467 --> 33:55.001
instead of punishing him for it?

33:55.035 --> 33:57.270
- It's still my patient.
- Very noble, Daniel,

33:57.304 --> 33:59.405
but I don't think that's
what this is about.

33:59.440 --> 34:01.199
I think this is about

34:01.205 --> 34:03.381
your guilt and your ego.

34:03.410 --> 34:05.640
You had a killer on your hands,

34:05.646 --> 34:07.680
and you missed the signs.

34:07.715 --> 34:10.616
And now you're trying to
make up for your mistake.

34:10.650 --> 34:14.219
You're trying to fix it
and get back in control.

34:14.254 --> 34:17.543
You've been through so much, Daniel.

34:17.550 --> 34:19.551
Let it go.

34:19.661 --> 34:22.127
Stop torturing yourself.

34:37.277 --> 34:38.811
Dr. Rhodes.

34:38.846 --> 34:41.380
I've been thinking about
your pulmonary thrombectomy.

34:41.415 --> 34:43.649
I can't help but wonder
if Dr. Bekker didn't...

34:43.684 --> 34:46.408
What's the word?
Manipulate me for her own gain.

34:48.322 --> 34:50.556
I wouldn't worry about it, Dr. Latham.

34:50.591 --> 34:52.254
I know that fellows compete for the most

34:52.260 --> 34:54.129
challenging cases to
improve their resumes.

34:55.027 --> 34:58.045
Perhaps in the end, you fared
better than Dr. Bekker.

34:59.536 --> 35:02.505
Is that why you gave me the transplant?

35:02.511 --> 35:04.345
I'm not sure.

35:04.705 --> 35:08.307
Sometimes my motivations are
a mystery to me, to be honest.

35:10.347 --> 35:12.208
Good night, Dr. Rhodes.

35:13.059 --> 35:15.761
Good night, Dr. Latham.

35:22.773 --> 35:24.272
Mrs. Cutler.

35:25.692 --> 35:28.428
The transplant was successful.

35:28.462 --> 35:32.298
The young man, the recipient
of your husband's heart,

35:32.332 --> 35:34.198
he's doing well.

35:38.739 --> 35:41.297
The last thing Brian heard me say

35:41.906 --> 35:44.641
was that I didn't love him.

35:49.821 --> 35:51.922
May I see him?

35:51.957 --> 35:53.557
The young man.

35:53.592 --> 35:55.456
- The heart recipient?
- Yes.

35:57.762 --> 35:59.347
Please.

36:13.178 --> 36:15.391
Closer. Please.

36:34.032 --> 36:37.101
I'm so sorry, Brian.

36:41.306 --> 36:43.164
I love you.

36:54.085 --> 36:55.788
Sorry I wasn't here to help

36:55.794 --> 36:58.477
ease you into civilian life.

36:59.370 --> 37:01.071
I mean, for all the good it did,

37:01.077 --> 37:03.212
I probably should've skipped
testifying all together.

37:03.502 --> 37:05.295
It's okay, Dad.

37:05.597 --> 37:07.998
I wish I could have been there for you.

37:08.033 --> 37:09.366
Oh, pff.

37:09.401 --> 37:12.069
I mean, at least I knew you were

37:12.103 --> 37:14.914
in Connor's very capable hands.

37:19.744 --> 37:22.142
What? What is it?

37:25.383 --> 37:27.291
He doesn't trust me.

37:28.540 --> 37:30.256
What do you mean?

37:30.455 --> 37:33.298
I saw a look on his face.

37:37.175 --> 37:39.486
He thinks my feelings for him

37:39.492 --> 37:41.563
are part of my disease.

37:43.635 --> 37:45.269
Oh, honey.

37:45.303 --> 37:46.769
Is he right?

37:49.708 --> 37:51.612
Or is this just...

37:52.711 --> 37:54.712
All in my head,

37:54.746 --> 37:57.481
and that's part of the disease?

37:59.772 --> 38:02.350
Dad, how do I know what's real?

38:02.587 --> 38:04.158
Come here.

38:11.296 --> 38:15.325
I mean, we're all driven by so many

38:16.301 --> 38:17.849
different things.

38:18.770 --> 38:20.938
Truthfully, a lot of the
time I don't have a clue

38:20.972 --> 38:22.707
why I do the things that I do.

38:23.508 --> 38:25.166
But I mean, even if you can't

38:25.172 --> 38:26.772
always trust your brain...

38:29.123 --> 38:31.332
Iin my experience, you're usually

38:31.338 --> 38:33.435
pretty safe trusting your heart.

38:35.320 --> 38:36.987
You know?

38:45.330 --> 38:47.260
Good night, Dr. Choi.

38:47.266 --> 38:49.471
Good night, April.

39:00.412 --> 39:01.979
I feel for that woman.

39:01.985 --> 39:04.079
Having to live with those regrets.

39:04.730 --> 39:05.954
Yeah.

39:06.951 --> 39:08.852
Well, good night, Will.

39:08.887 --> 39:10.254
Night.

39:10.288 --> 39:12.256
Natalie.

39:14.492 --> 39:17.142
When you left, you knew
about me and Nina.

39:18.696 --> 39:20.299
But I didn't get a chance to tell you

39:20.305 --> 39:22.539
why I broke up with her.

39:26.738 --> 39:29.037
It was because of the
feelings I have for you.

39:31.309 --> 39:33.996
Those feelings haven't gone away.

39:36.648 --> 39:38.215
You don't have to say anything.

39:38.249 --> 39:40.050
I don't have any expectations.

39:40.084 --> 39:41.360
I just...

39:41.777 --> 39:43.644
I felt I had to tell you.

39:44.254 --> 39:46.087
My, um...

39:46.672 --> 39:48.145
My sabbatical.

39:51.162 --> 39:54.298
Things I needed to think about...

39:58.069 --> 40:00.337
It's you.
