01:38.320 --> 01:39.591
Courtney!

01:53.680 --> 01:58.471
<i>I had this sensation of someone
taking my hand, guiding me...</i>

01:58.560 --> 02:01.991
<i>I looked up and I saw this light.</i>

02:02.080 --> 02:05.031
<i>The giant wall of light. Brighter...</i>

02:05.120 --> 02:07.711
<i>All of a sudden, I was in a different place.</i>

02:07.800 --> 02:08.870
<i>Pure energy.</i>

02:09.160 --> 02:13.200
<i>I fail to find words that can describe
what I experienced.</i>

02:13.320 --> 02:17.360
<i>At that point,
I had that out-of-body experience.</i>

02:17.440 --> 02:20.433
<i>I remember a feeling
of being sucked backwards,</i>

02:20.560 --> 02:23.314
<i>like being pulled through water.</i>

02:23.400 --> 02:25.312
<i>I wasn't having thoughts of my own.</i>

02:25.400 --> 02:29.360
<i>Answers, messages coming through me.</i>

02:29.440 --> 02:32.956
<i>Colors were so vivid.
Colors I've never seen before.</i>

02:33.040 --> 02:36.158
<i>Then I was pushed right back into my body.</i>

02:36.320 --> 02:39.279
<i>I could actually see my body from above,</i>

02:39.360 --> 02:41.272
<i>like it was lifeless.</i>

02:41.360 --> 02:42.396
<i>And I was floating up...</i>

02:42.480 --> 02:44.836
<i>Everything I thought was important was</i>

02:44.920 --> 02:48.470
<i>dwarfed by this sense of love.</i>

02:48.560 --> 02:50.074
<i>And I could feel this pull,</i>

02:50.160 --> 02:54.234
<i>a force trying to drag me down
this black tunnel.</i>

02:54.360 --> 02:55.396
<i>Where is it taking me?</i>

02:55.680 --> 02:58.514
<i>I don't know what's going on.</i>

02:58.600 --> 03:00.239
<i>I think I'm going crazy.</i>

03:01.080 --> 03:03.834
<i>I'm seeing things.</i>

03:03.920 --> 03:06.640
<i>Something I did.</i>

03:07.760 --> 03:09.752
I'm sorry.

03:23.680 --> 03:25.399
Hello, Lauren.

03:26.720 --> 03:28.279
How are you feeling?

03:34.560 --> 03:36.313
You had a seizure tonight.

03:36.760 --> 03:39.434
You're at Trinity Emmanuel Medical Center.

03:54.080 --> 03:56.993
Lauren,

03:57.080 --> 03:59.072
do you know that your heart stopped?

03:59.800 --> 04:01.200
You were gone for several minutes,

04:01.280 --> 04:03.272
but the trauma team brought you back.

04:04.880 --> 04:07.031
Do you remember any of that?

04:09.160 --> 04:12.358
If you felt anything, if you saw anything?

04:14.960 --> 04:18.397
Did you lose someone, sweetheart?

04:19.959 --> 04:21.279
She's in here.

04:23.840 --> 04:26.674
We're taking you to Imaging. You'll be okay.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.119
One for transfer in five.

04:38.080 --> 04:39.833
Ready? One, two, three.

04:41.840 --> 04:43.035
Transfer from Holy Cross.

04:43.120 --> 04:45.351
38-year-old construction
worker, fell off a beam.

04:45.440 --> 04:47.352
Persistent coma. GCS 6.

04:47.680 --> 04:49.080
I'll page the resident.

04:49.160 --> 04:50.480
Already done. I got this.

04:50.880 --> 04:53.236
- Which one of you is in charge here?
- It's my intake.

04:53.360 --> 04:55.352
Actually, I'm the one on duty.

04:55.760 --> 04:57.797
I got it. I got it. Thank you.

04:58.680 --> 05:00.672
Standard procedure for a GCS 6 admit

05:00.760 --> 05:03.514
calls for two large-bore IVs
and diazepam on standby.

05:03.600 --> 05:04.795
Seizure meds won't do any good.

05:04.880 --> 05:07.440
Whatever is wrong is
in his spinal column, not his brain.

05:07.520 --> 05:09.432
And what medical protocol are you citing?

05:09.560 --> 05:12.155
The protocol of actually living
in the real world,

05:12.240 --> 05:15.551
where guys with crappy HMOs
go undiagnosed for spinal injuries.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.234
Actually, he's on seizure meds,

05:18.320 --> 05:21.119
which is the medical protocol
of reading his chart.

05:23.560 --> 05:24.835
Shit. No, no, no.

05:26.280 --> 05:28.636
- Shit.
- What is it?

05:29.200 --> 05:30.190
Respiratory failure.

05:30.320 --> 05:31.310
He might be hemorrhaging.

05:31.400 --> 05:34.154
Page Neurosurgery, call a code,
and get CT on standby.

05:34.240 --> 05:35.230
Students, clear the room.

06:11.480 --> 06:14.393
Hey. What is it? What's wrong?

06:15.400 --> 06:17.278
Did you know that there's 12 pairs of nerves

06:17.360 --> 06:19.192
just within the cranial area?

06:19.280 --> 06:24.560
The oculomotor, the trochlear,
the glossopharyngeal, and...

06:25.800 --> 06:28.315
Nine others whose names I cannot remember.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.756
I cannot absorb any more terminology.

06:31.200 --> 06:34.398
I have, like, a rash on my arm.
I can't sleep.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.354
You know, my mother invested

06:38.440 --> 06:41.399
her entire life savings into my education.

06:43.480 --> 06:44.994
Come on.

06:45.080 --> 06:47.231
Come on, that's enough suffering
for one night.

06:47.880 --> 06:49.951
Let's get out of here. Yeah?

06:50.920 --> 06:52.149
It's cold.

06:52.240 --> 06:54.630
We used to be friends, right?

06:54.720 --> 06:56.598
- What is...
- Like, our first year,

06:56.680 --> 06:58.990
when we would sit together at lecture.
Remember?

06:59.520 --> 07:02.240
And we'd, like, go running and get coffee.

07:02.320 --> 07:04.039
Hang out. Do stuff.

07:04.120 --> 07:05.554
We're still friends, though.

07:05.640 --> 07:07.757
No, we don't talk.

07:07.840 --> 07:10.674
We just work and compete.

07:10.760 --> 07:13.559
Who's the fastest to make
a diagnosis of Bell's palsy?

07:13.640 --> 07:16.200
Quick, what's the seven
side effects of Ativan?

07:16.520 --> 07:20.309
You know, just last week,
a second-year committed suicide.

07:21.520 --> 07:23.876
God, Court, you're gonna be
such a good doctor.

07:23.960 --> 07:26.316
Medicine just, like, comes easy to you.

07:29.400 --> 07:32.234
You know, I think there's a way that
we could spend more time together.

07:33.240 --> 07:34.959
- What do you mean?
- Well, I'm just wondering

07:35.040 --> 07:36.440
if you'd help me on this little, like,

07:36.560 --> 07:38.916
extracurricular project I've been working on.

07:41.600 --> 07:43.671
We have neuro shelf exams in, like, 10 days.

07:44.600 --> 07:47.911
I don't really feel like I'm gonna make it.

07:50.240 --> 07:54.871
Oh, Once One Takes The Anatomy Final,
Very Good Vacations Are Heavenly.

07:55.200 --> 07:57.874
- What?
- It's a mnemonic phrase.

07:58.720 --> 08:00.791
You use it to remember the 12 cranial nerves.

08:01.320 --> 08:02.800
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

08:02.880 --> 08:04.633
You're welcome.

08:05.520 --> 08:08.274
But, yeah, I really would love your help.

08:09.320 --> 08:10.754
Maybe.

08:14.560 --> 08:15.710
Hey.

08:16.040 --> 08:17.838
What's in those?

08:17.920 --> 08:20.640
First one's Mountain Dew laced with Adderall.

08:20.720 --> 08:22.393
Other's a chaser of espressos.

08:22.520 --> 08:25.035
- Together, it's a liquid heart attack.
- Hey, Jamie.

08:26.160 --> 08:27.594
Jesus.

08:29.320 --> 08:30.959
Hey.

08:31.040 --> 08:32.793
"Hey, Jamie." Where were you last night?

08:33.440 --> 08:35.477
Your eyes are still dilated.

08:35.799 --> 08:37.917
25-year-old female, admitted last night.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.913
Complaining of numbness on left side,
nausea, vomiting.

08:41.320 --> 08:43.710
Anything of note from the physical exam?

08:44.000 --> 08:47.550
Sees the color red differently between
left and right eye, and oral ulcers.

08:47.920 --> 08:49.434
Sophia, what test should we run?

08:50.040 --> 08:52.600
A lumbar puncture, then MRI of the brain.

08:52.760 --> 08:55.878
Fine, but reverse the order.
Images first, then procedure.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.469
Preliminary diagnosis, Brad.

08:58.640 --> 09:00.040
- Pituitary cyst?
- No.

09:00.280 --> 09:01.270
Jamie.

09:03.480 --> 09:04.470
Jackie.

09:04.720 --> 09:06.473
- Stroke?
- My God.

09:07.120 --> 09:08.520
You need to do better than this.

09:08.600 --> 09:09.590
All of you.

09:10.760 --> 09:14.390
What do you think the largest
age demographic is in our society today?

09:15.240 --> 09:16.276
You.

09:16.360 --> 09:18.079
Young adults in their 20s, which means

09:18.200 --> 09:20.431
that there are at least 1,000 people waiting

09:20.520 --> 09:22.159
to take your spot.

09:22.240 --> 09:24.550
And we are not in the business of
training country club doctors,

09:24.800 --> 09:27.599
nor do we waste our time
on students who think

09:27.680 --> 09:30.832
that they can skate by
doing the least work necessary.

09:31.080 --> 09:34.073
We are here to educate students
who push themselves,

09:34.160 --> 09:36.755
those who are capable
of making new discoveries

09:36.840 --> 09:40.151
and actually move the dial
on human knowledge.

09:40.240 --> 09:42.391
And for those of you who think
that's too much,

09:42.560 --> 09:44.438
then you should leave.

09:44.560 --> 09:47.029
And by that, I mean now.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.359
Marlo, if I were to tell you

09:53.440 --> 09:55.875
that the patient's family
background was Mediterranean,

09:55.960 --> 09:59.351
i.e., Greek or Turkish,
what would the diagnosis be?

10:06.600 --> 10:08.512
I don't think you'll find it
in your notebook.

10:11.720 --> 10:12.995
It's Behcet's disease.

10:15.120 --> 10:16.759
Thank you, Ray.

10:17.160 --> 10:18.514
Moving on.

10:28.720 --> 10:30.552
Why are you working this event?

10:30.840 --> 10:34.197
You're a trust-fund kid.
You sleep on a sailboat.

10:34.320 --> 10:36.357
Yeah, but there's this really hot caterer

10:36.440 --> 10:37.920
I've been trying to meet.

10:38.320 --> 10:40.994
Look at all these stodgy
old docs with their white wine

10:41.280 --> 10:42.873
and their golf games.

10:43.360 --> 10:44.874
I don't think it's such a bad life.

10:45.560 --> 10:46.550
I don't know about you,

10:46.640 --> 10:50.759
but I'm certainly not gonna spend
the next 40 years doing prostate exams.

10:51.880 --> 10:53.678
No one pays their dues anymore.

10:53.760 --> 10:55.672
Our generation,
it's all about entrepreneurship.

10:55.800 --> 10:57.359
Yeah, so what are you gonna do?

10:57.640 --> 10:59.279
I'm going to LA.

10:59.440 --> 11:00.476
Look at this face.

11:00.560 --> 11:02.756
I'm gonna be the Anderson Cooper
of celebrity medicine.

11:03.680 --> 11:04.716
Okay.

11:05.240 --> 11:07.835
"Hi, Mom. It's my afternoon check-in."

11:07.960 --> 11:09.235
That's funny. Cool. Okay.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.312
You know there's nothing
I can do about her right now.

11:11.720 --> 11:14.633
Did she really move here
just to keep tabs on you?

11:16.080 --> 11:17.309
Hey, come on, look.

11:17.400 --> 11:19.756
- My station is full.
- Okay.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.035
You're so behind.

11:27.280 --> 11:30.876
Okay, sir, got to give you a testicular exam.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.719
- Should just take a minute.
- What? No.

11:33.080 --> 11:34.400
- Excuse the reach.
- Wait a minute.

11:35.000 --> 11:35.990
I don't enjoy it either.

11:36.080 --> 11:39.152
Just close your eyes and pretend
I'm the candy-stripe girl.

11:39.280 --> 11:40.760
What? Get, get the hell off of me!

11:40.840 --> 11:41.830
Hold on.

11:41.920 --> 11:43.320
- Candy-stripe girl.
- Get...

11:43.840 --> 11:45.797
- No, wait a minute.
- Stop! What are you doing?

11:45.920 --> 11:47.673
He doesn't need a testicular exam.

11:49.600 --> 11:50.750
He doesn't?

11:52.240 --> 11:54.391
Come near me again, and I'm killing you.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.393
You know, I think I got mixed up.

11:58.720 --> 12:03.431
It says here the resident wanted a neural
test for that guy, not a testicular exam.

12:04.360 --> 12:06.829
I can't imagine how I passed
the wrong information to you.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.719
Very funny.

12:11.040 --> 12:13.680
Ray can be a real dick sometimes.
You guys notice that?

12:13.760 --> 12:15.080
I think he's intriguing.

12:15.640 --> 12:17.836
Let's go, people. No lunch break today.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.799
Every bed in the unit is full,
and we got referrals waiting in the ER.

12:20.880 --> 12:22.599
Get moving on afternoon rounds.

12:24.280 --> 12:25.873
Excuse me.

12:33.880 --> 12:35.473
Do you have plans tonight?

12:36.400 --> 12:38.676
First-years are having a wingding.

12:38.760 --> 12:42.231
Dorm punch and a deejay,
but I'm not above it.

12:42.360 --> 12:44.352
I can't wait for the anesthesia rotation.

12:44.440 --> 12:46.716
Those guys have access to the best drugs.

12:47.440 --> 12:48.510
Looking for this?

12:50.160 --> 12:51.435
Hell yeah.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.712
I found it on my nightstand.

12:54.080 --> 12:55.400
See you later.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.316
These second-years have no tact,

13:01.400 --> 13:04.279
coming up to me like that
in front of my colleague.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.953
Yeah, we're colleagues, aren't we?

13:07.640 --> 13:09.279
I mean, we have fun together.

13:09.920 --> 13:11.036
Yeah, kinda.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.717
Do you want to have fun with me later?

13:17.600 --> 13:20.513
Courtney Holmes, I am mildly surprised

13:20.640 --> 13:22.791
to be having this conversation with you.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.399
But offer accepted.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.837
Midnight, basement, sub level C.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.753
You want to meet me in the basement?

13:36.040 --> 13:39.317
Sublevel C, underneath the old building.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.278
And take the service elevator,

13:42.400 --> 13:44.676
'cause it doesn't have surveillance cameras.

13:45.120 --> 13:47.191
Yeah. Good idea.

14:04.360 --> 14:05.589
No.

14:09.200 --> 14:10.270
Jesus!

14:10.360 --> 14:11.350
You're late.

14:15.240 --> 14:16.674
What are we doing down here?

14:17.000 --> 14:18.832
Come on, we don't have much time.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.999
Okay, Courtney, what's going on?

14:23.400 --> 14:25.756
It's past midnight. I should be studying.

14:26.160 --> 14:27.913
We're almost there, okay?

14:39.800 --> 14:41.519
What is all of this?

14:41.800 --> 14:43.439
They put this in five years ago.

14:43.520 --> 14:46.035
In case of a natural disaster, loss of power.

14:46.360 --> 14:49.353
It's a fully functioning hospital,
and it never gets used.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.071
Court, what exactly are you up to?

15:10.840 --> 15:11.990
Two of you.

15:12.080 --> 15:13.196
Jamie, what are you doing here?

15:13.720 --> 15:15.791
She didn't tell me about you either, okay?

15:15.880 --> 15:18.031
But, I'm open to a three-way.

15:18.160 --> 15:19.196
Shut up.

15:19.280 --> 15:20.600
What?

15:21.600 --> 15:22.954
I like it.

15:23.040 --> 15:25.680
Scanners, cameras, our choice of beds.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.634
- We can be as loud as we want.
- Courtney, what's going on?

15:28.720 --> 15:31.872
I asked for his help, too.
He probably misinterpreted.

15:32.640 --> 15:33.869
You mean we're not getting it on?

15:33.960 --> 15:35.474
Wait, what are you talking about?

15:35.720 --> 15:37.598
I've been searching
for the region of the brain

15:37.680 --> 15:40.149
that is responsible
for near-death experiences.

15:40.720 --> 15:43.554
And these are postmortem scans

15:43.640 --> 15:45.871
of patients that have died in this hospital.

15:46.200 --> 15:48.078
Is there any circumstance under which

15:48.160 --> 15:49.594
- you'd have sex with me?
- God, stop.

15:49.840 --> 15:52.594
Look, if the brain is just another organ,

15:52.720 --> 15:55.155
why doesn't it just go dark and shut off

15:55.240 --> 15:56.390
at the moment of death?

15:56.840 --> 15:58.240
You know, why the floating?

15:58.320 --> 15:59.390
Why the white light?

15:59.520 --> 16:00.840
Why the sense of well-being?

16:01.520 --> 16:03.318
I mean, what is that experience?

16:03.720 --> 16:07.111
Is it chemical, or is it something else?

16:07.200 --> 16:10.637
Can we map that process
the way we map a seizure?

16:12.480 --> 16:16.360
What if we could actually document
what happens to us after we die?

16:16.880 --> 16:18.155
What do you mean?

16:18.440 --> 16:20.193
Nothing happens. We're dead.

16:20.520 --> 16:22.239
What if we could prove otherwise?

16:22.880 --> 16:27.033
Can you imagine
the residency offers you would get?

16:27.400 --> 16:28.834
And forget about Dr. Oz.

16:28.920 --> 16:32.470
I mean, you would be the world's
first specialist in the afterlife.

16:33.120 --> 16:35.430
Okay, you got my attention.

16:36.080 --> 16:37.639
Come on. This isn't science.

16:37.760 --> 16:39.114
This is pseudoscience.

16:39.320 --> 16:41.880
Well, maybe. Maybe not.

16:41.960 --> 16:45.271
But the only way to find out
is to see for ourselves.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.837
So I would like you both to stop my heart.

16:52.680 --> 16:54.239
Look, I'll be in the imaging scanner.

16:54.320 --> 16:57.631
It will take real-time pictures
of my brain's hemodynamic activity.

16:57.960 --> 17:00.156
You give it one minute,
and then you bring me back.

17:00.280 --> 17:01.350
Wait, you're serious?

17:01.800 --> 17:04.440
- Stop your heart?
- This is propofol.

17:04.560 --> 17:06.313
Fifty milligrams will knock me out.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.753
I'll be wrapped in a cooling blanket,

17:07.880 --> 17:10.634
bringing my core body temperature
down to 86 degrees.

17:10.720 --> 17:11.994
And once that happens,

17:12.079 --> 17:15.311
you administer a defibrillator shock
to stop my heart.

17:15.800 --> 17:16.950
Wait a sec.

17:17.560 --> 17:19.472
Look, I've signed a release. It's in my bag.

17:19.599 --> 17:22.069
It absolves you both of any responsibility.

17:22.280 --> 17:24.875
Courtney, think about what
you're saying right now.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.634
Hey. Look, if she's insane enough to
try it, who are we to stop her?

17:27.839 --> 17:31.197
Look, I'm young, okay?
I'm in excellent health.

17:31.560 --> 17:34.234
You're both trained in emergency medicine.

17:34.360 --> 17:37.478
So reviving me should be
very straightforward.

17:38.200 --> 17:40.157
Look, it's 12:18 now.

17:40.240 --> 17:42.914
I've checked the schedules
for security down here

17:43.040 --> 17:45.509
and cleaning crews.

17:45.600 --> 17:49.116
We have about 45 minutes,
so we should probably get going.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.392
What? This is crazy.
No, count me out of this.

17:51.480 --> 17:53.790
I am not helping you kill yourself.

17:54.360 --> 17:57.239
Well, then you can stand by the door
and make sure nobody comes in.

18:03.280 --> 18:05.317
Okay, remember, there's a magnet
in the scanner,

18:05.400 --> 18:07.198
so no keys or metal in the room.

18:07.280 --> 18:09.078
Look, we've got it.

18:10.160 --> 18:12.231
Wait, Jamie,
what if you can't bring her back?

18:12.560 --> 18:14.756
Then we burn her body, work out our alibi,

18:14.880 --> 18:16.394
and pretend like nothing happened.

18:16.480 --> 18:17.960
And make sure that the scanner's recording,

18:18.040 --> 18:20.839
because if not,
then this whole exercise is pointless.

18:22.880 --> 18:24.200
We're good to go.

18:24.280 --> 18:26.670
Repeat back to me
the resuscitation procedure.

18:29.040 --> 18:32.590
As soon as you're dead, I'll run the scanner.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.712
At 60 seconds, I'll start pulling you out

18:34.880 --> 18:36.792
by switching to the heating blanket.

18:36.880 --> 18:40.271
When your core temp's back up
to 93 degrees, I'll start CPR.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.995
Crash cart is standing by
with the epi and the defib.

18:43.160 --> 18:46.198
Hello? Brain damage. You'll get brain damage.

18:46.320 --> 18:47.754
Not if you resuscitate me in time.

18:48.040 --> 18:51.078
Brain cells can survive without oxygen
for at least four minutes.

18:51.200 --> 18:52.759
Okay.

18:52.840 --> 18:55.116
Now is the point
where you say it's all a joke.

19:05.200 --> 19:07.157
Okay, put the blanket on me.

19:09.120 --> 19:11.794
Jamie, look at her. Come on, she's terrified.

19:12.680 --> 19:15.991
It's just my body's
natural survival instincts.

19:16.800 --> 19:20.760
I anticipated this.
I'm trying to block it out.

19:21.800 --> 19:23.951
Okay.

19:28.360 --> 19:29.919
And now I kill you.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.469
Come on, you'll both get expelled.
You'll go to prison.

19:32.600 --> 19:34.114
Only if you blab about it.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.919
Okay. We're really doing this.

19:47.880 --> 19:49.553
See you later.

19:57.520 --> 19:59.193
She's out.

19:59.440 --> 20:01.272
Body temp's dropping.

20:01.840 --> 20:04.560
Okay, look, Jamie,
we can stop right here, okay?

20:04.800 --> 20:07.993
She sleeps it off, wakes up, and we just
pretend that we followed through with it.

20:10.760 --> 20:12.797
If you can't handle this, then look away.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.472
Fine. Yeah, Jamie, I'll just leave!

20:15.680 --> 20:17.990
- Charging 200.
- Come on! This is wrong!

20:18.120 --> 20:19.679
- Weren't you leaving?
- You're murdering somebody!

20:19.760 --> 20:22.434
Yeah, I probably should've stayed in tonight.

20:32.320 --> 20:34.277
Clear!

20:42.760 --> 20:44.479
Oh, my God.

20:46.880 --> 20:49.076
- She's...
- Dead.

20:50.200 --> 20:51.554
I think.

20:54.200 --> 20:56.431
Counting off 60 seconds.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.758
Do you see any brain activity?

21:04.200 --> 21:05.839
I mean, something's going on,
I'm not really sure what.

21:05.920 --> 21:07.559
It's recording, isn't it?

21:08.440 --> 21:10.875
Yeah. Yeah.

21:58.120 --> 22:01.272
- <i>Fifty-one, 52...</i>
- <i>Fifty-three...</i>

22:01.560 --> 22:06.351
<i>Fifty-four, 55, 56, 57,</i>

22:06.760 --> 22:09.832
fifty-eight, 59,

22:09.920 --> 22:11.593
- sixty seconds.
- Get her out.

22:13.160 --> 22:15.152
Okay. Okay. Okay.

22:16.280 --> 22:17.270
Blanket's warming.

22:17.440 --> 22:19.716
- What's her temp need to get to again?
- Doesn't matter. Hurry up.

22:19.800 --> 22:21.439
Calm down.

22:24.080 --> 22:25.400
- Charge 200.
- Wait!

22:25.520 --> 22:27.318
Clear!

22:34.120 --> 22:35.110
It's not working.

22:35.240 --> 22:36.435
Of course it isn't.

22:36.520 --> 22:38.273
Paddles are useless without a heart rhythm.

22:38.360 --> 22:39.396
Didn't you listen to her?

22:39.480 --> 22:40.960
Yeah, I was gonna write down all the steps...

22:41.080 --> 22:42.434
Move! Just move.

22:43.720 --> 22:45.279
Move!

22:53.080 --> 22:55.595
Did we order an MRI on... Hey.

23:01.840 --> 23:03.354
- Wait, what are you doing?
- I...

23:03.440 --> 23:05.193
No, she needs an epi.

23:06.480 --> 23:08.676
IV, you moron. God, it's already set up.

23:09.400 --> 23:10.754
Just push the drug into the goddamn arm!

23:10.840 --> 23:12.240
Calm down! I got this.

23:34.160 --> 23:36.072
God.

23:54.440 --> 23:55.954
It's not working. Try something else!

23:56.080 --> 23:57.480
There is nothing else.

23:58.680 --> 24:00.114
Well, I...

24:00.600 --> 24:01.750
What the fuck?

24:01.840 --> 24:02.830
It was an experiment.

24:02.960 --> 24:04.633
She had us stop her heart,
and we can't get her back.

24:04.720 --> 24:06.757
- How long has she been out?
- I don't know, a couple of minutes.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.109
Look, I say we try the paddles.

24:08.200 --> 24:10.192
No, no! Wait! Put them down.

24:11.560 --> 24:13.313
I... Stop, stop.

24:14.560 --> 24:16.631
Take over for Sophia
on the chest compressions.

24:16.720 --> 24:19.315
Do them much harder,
get on top of her if it helps.

24:20.560 --> 24:23.792
Sophia, put that cooling blanket on.
She's too warm.

24:24.200 --> 24:27.113
Then charge the defib
all the way to 360 and stand by.

24:27.280 --> 24:28.873
As soon as Jamie and I get you a heartbeat,

24:28.960 --> 24:30.952
however fluttering,
you put those paddles on her

24:31.040 --> 24:32.474
and give her full power.

24:32.560 --> 24:34.199
The blanket. Come on.

24:35.680 --> 24:37.637
Got to push a lot more epi
than what you've been doing.

24:41.360 --> 24:43.158
Don't stop. Don't stop. Keep going.

24:44.200 --> 24:45.350
All right.

24:45.640 --> 24:46.960
Come on, Courtney.

24:47.040 --> 24:48.269
She's hypoxic.

24:48.400 --> 24:49.834
We need to intubate.

24:51.800 --> 24:53.439
All right? Go!

25:18.280 --> 25:19.555
Let's get it off.

25:31.800 --> 25:32.950
Help me.

25:54.920 --> 25:56.832
BVM.

26:02.320 --> 26:03.800
All right.

26:12.360 --> 26:13.919
Go, go, go, go.

26:15.480 --> 26:16.994
Clear!

26:27.680 --> 26:29.399
Courtney, can you hear me?

26:29.880 --> 26:31.234
You're crazy, you know that?

26:31.640 --> 26:33.871
- You called Ray?
- Were you getting it done?

26:38.280 --> 26:39.794
Does somebody want to fill me in here?

26:42.680 --> 26:44.876
It happened very gently.

26:45.520 --> 26:49.036
Like, almost like an untethering.

26:49.320 --> 26:51.755
And I floated to the ceiling.

26:51.920 --> 26:56.312
I could see my body.
I could see Sophia and Jamie.

26:57.520 --> 27:01.275
And then I could see
the roof of the hospital.

27:02.760 --> 27:04.399
And I've never been up there.

27:05.640 --> 27:07.597
How do you explain that?

27:07.680 --> 27:10.036
I can't explain it.

27:10.880 --> 27:12.439
Are you mad at us?

27:13.000 --> 27:14.912
I don't know what to think

27:15.240 --> 27:17.835
other than you're all pretty stupid.

27:18.920 --> 27:20.912
She's lucky to be alive.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.239
She's alive because of you.

27:24.200 --> 27:26.112
What else happened?

27:27.320 --> 27:28.993
Did you see a white light?

27:30.120 --> 27:32.589
I wouldn't call it that. It was...

27:34.640 --> 27:37.553
It was more like...

27:38.480 --> 27:40.437
Pure energy.

27:43.920 --> 27:47.470
And honestly,
it was kind of sexual, actually.

27:48.640 --> 27:50.313
It was kind of sexual.

27:51.280 --> 27:52.475
Guys, playback's ready.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.433
Hey. Check this out.

27:58.920 --> 28:01.435
Okay, look. We're counting up
from zero at the moment of death.

28:01.560 --> 28:03.040
Cognitive activity has ceased.

28:03.200 --> 28:06.637
Your heart stopped. No breathing, no pulse.

28:07.360 --> 28:10.717
We're 15 seconds in, and there.

28:13.120 --> 28:14.395
Look at that.

28:14.520 --> 28:17.991
Like a bolt of lightning
in your prefrontal cortex.

28:18.440 --> 28:21.080
We might just be witnessing
the afterlife, people.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.395
Okay.

28:22.520 --> 28:24.239
Who knows what we're looking at?

28:24.360 --> 28:25.555
We're not radiologists.

28:25.720 --> 28:28.440
I mean, it could just be
residual electricity.

28:28.800 --> 28:30.712
- You know, synapses shutting down.
- Okay, we're moving on.

28:30.840 --> 28:33.674
So, you've been dead almost 40 seconds now,

28:33.800 --> 28:36.190
and look.

28:36.840 --> 28:39.116
This area lights up, the hippocampus.

28:39.240 --> 28:41.709
- That's not the hippocampus.
- Of course it is.

28:42.160 --> 28:44.675
That is the ventral tegmental area.

28:44.760 --> 28:48.475
It's the oldest part of the brain,
governs thirst, hunger, love.

28:48.720 --> 28:50.916
Okay, doctors, I'm glad you're having fun.

28:51.080 --> 28:52.400
Got to get out of here.

28:52.480 --> 28:53.550
Hey, Ray, come on.

28:53.640 --> 28:54.994
Hey, no. Just let him go.

28:57.560 --> 29:00.029
It's over. Her brain's just dark now.

29:01.080 --> 29:02.673
- No.
- Look at that.

29:02.960 --> 29:04.553
Wait. Amygdala.

29:05.280 --> 29:06.555
That's the amygdala. Rage.

29:06.840 --> 29:08.433
Stress. Emotional memory.

29:09.880 --> 29:11.200
Whatever you were seeing,

29:11.320 --> 29:13.596
this is just before we pulled you out.

29:21.320 --> 29:22.595
Is she okay?

29:22.680 --> 29:24.637
She's been sitting there
for, like, 10 minutes.

29:24.720 --> 29:26.439
- Really?
- Yeah.

29:27.080 --> 29:29.276
What do you think she's doing out there?

29:29.640 --> 29:32.075
I hope she doesn't try to fly.

29:33.440 --> 29:35.477
If there were brain chemicals released,

29:35.840 --> 29:38.036
the aftereffects could still be
in her bloodstream.

29:38.720 --> 29:40.552
I took LSD once.

29:41.240 --> 29:43.038
I stayed awake for three days.

29:43.440 --> 29:44.874
Shit.

29:45.920 --> 29:47.274
I'm gonna go check on her.

29:49.480 --> 29:50.960
Let's leave.

29:53.840 --> 29:55.513
That's high.

29:56.040 --> 29:57.269
Hey.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.673
Are you okay?

30:00.040 --> 30:01.838
I'm gonna bake some bread.

30:09.600 --> 30:10.920
What's with the bread?

30:11.400 --> 30:14.518
Courtney baked it. Six loaves, last night.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.673
She remembered her grandmother's recipe.

30:17.040 --> 30:18.952
Also, she ran 12 miles.

30:19.480 --> 30:21.358
- Twelve miles?
- Let's begin.

30:22.600 --> 30:24.796
We've been ramping up Michael Evergreen
with meds for ten hours,

30:24.920 --> 30:26.752
and his epilepsy hasn't gotten any better.

30:26.840 --> 30:28.160
Now he's developed a skin rash.

30:28.280 --> 30:30.511
It's a mystery. The meds should be working.

30:31.160 --> 30:32.276
Carbamazepine?

30:34.680 --> 30:35.670
What?

30:35.760 --> 30:38.434
Carbamazepine has an 11% chance
of reacting negatively

30:38.520 --> 30:40.034
with lamotrigine, which is the other drug

30:40.120 --> 30:41.998
- that Michael's on.
- Seriously?

30:44.200 --> 30:45.680
Good catch, Courtney.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.434
Sophia, next case.

30:48.760 --> 30:51.832
Adele Gunther. 44 years old.
Admitted with mild confusion.

30:52.400 --> 30:55.040
Says her sister's an impostor,
she doesn't recognize her.

30:55.200 --> 30:57.431
No history of trauma. Too young for dementia.

30:57.520 --> 30:58.840
We're gonna send it out to Psychiatry for...

30:58.960 --> 30:59.996
It's Capgras syndrome.

31:02.760 --> 31:05.150
- Go on.
- Capgras is an impairment

31:05.240 --> 31:07.277
of the brain's facial recognition center.

31:07.480 --> 31:09.199
And a very rare diagnosis.

31:09.800 --> 31:12.395
V.S. Ramachandran, in his book,
<i>Phantoms of the Brain,</i>

31:12.640 --> 31:16.350
links frontal cortex dichotomies,
like this, to Capgras.

31:17.360 --> 31:18.874
That's not on this year's syllabus.

31:20.440 --> 31:22.318
Optional reading in my first year.

31:23.520 --> 31:25.751
Well, that's more like it.

31:42.200 --> 31:44.078
My sister loved this piece.

31:45.560 --> 31:48.280
Drug warnings for carbamazepine
run 20 pages long.

31:48.400 --> 31:50.710
How could she possibly
recall a detail like that?

31:50.800 --> 31:53.713
How is she playing the piano again,
after 12 years?

31:54.200 --> 31:55.873
She's not playing that well.

31:56.800 --> 31:58.792
It's like her brain's been rewired,

31:59.040 --> 32:01.475
accessing everything she's ever learned.

32:01.760 --> 32:03.638
I don't care what happened to her.

32:03.760 --> 32:06.070
This experiment needs to end right now.

32:06.160 --> 32:09.551
I'm not gonna risk everything
for a morbid fascination you guys have.

32:10.720 --> 32:13.554
You think you're all medical pioneers?

32:13.680 --> 32:16.798
You're just a bunch of
rich kids screwing around,

32:16.880 --> 32:19.111
before you become wealthy specialists

32:19.200 --> 32:23.080
with your Ivy League bumper stickers
on your Mercedes.

32:23.480 --> 32:24.880
I was with you until the end.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.720
No one puts bumper stickers on a Mercedes.

32:37.600 --> 32:39.990
I think we're way past parlor tricks here.

32:40.360 --> 32:42.192
That does it. I'm going next.

32:42.520 --> 32:44.113
- Okay.
- Tonight. I am.

32:44.240 --> 32:45.913
And you're all gonna be there.

32:50.280 --> 32:52.112
It's a good day to die.

34:53.920 --> 34:55.911
No! No!

35:08.440 --> 35:10.079
Jesus Christ.

35:36.600 --> 35:38.000
Is that what I looked like?

35:38.080 --> 35:39.912
Yep. Exactly like that.

35:42.160 --> 35:44.356
- I knew you'd show up.
- How long has he been under?

35:45.120 --> 35:46.600
Forty-five seconds.

35:46.680 --> 35:49.718
I thought you'd had it
with all this foolishness.

35:50.120 --> 35:51.600
Jamie asked me to be here.

35:53.040 --> 35:54.633
He wanted me to pull him out.

36:17.240 --> 36:19.391
- Pause compressions.
- One, two, three...

36:19.480 --> 36:21.233
- Still no heartbeat.
- Pushing epi.

36:21.360 --> 36:23.920
- Come on, Jamie, wake up.
- He can't hear you.

36:24.680 --> 36:26.194
Sophia, get ready to intubate.

36:26.280 --> 36:28.397
Okay. I've never done this before,

36:28.480 --> 36:29.800
- so just give me a second...
- Just do it!

36:29.920 --> 36:31.877
Ray, relax. There's no need to panic.

36:32.320 --> 36:34.039
Let's give the epi a second to work.

37:04.600 --> 37:07.559
<i>Jamie...</i>

37:08.600 --> 37:10.353
Clear!

37:12.160 --> 37:13.514
Take it out, take it out.

37:16.280 --> 37:18.112
Hey...

37:19.960 --> 37:21.679
Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.

37:23.560 --> 37:25.438
I need a drink.

37:25.520 --> 37:27.512
Shots, shots, shots!

37:28.200 --> 37:29.953
Yeah, come on.

37:30.040 --> 37:32.509
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

37:47.880 --> 37:50.190
What do you guys think about
taking this wall down?

37:50.280 --> 37:52.749
- No, no, no.
- I've always wanted a loft.

38:27.040 --> 38:28.554
It's hailing! Courtney!

38:28.640 --> 38:29.915
What?

38:41.040 --> 38:42.360
Watch it.

38:45.320 --> 38:46.470
This is crazy.

38:46.560 --> 38:48.552
It's like they're on the same wavelength.

38:49.600 --> 38:52.832
We should bottle flatlining,
sell it as a club drug.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.957
Here. Use this.

38:57.920 --> 38:59.479
- Hey, no, no.
- No, no, no.

39:02.680 --> 39:04.353
Oh, my God.

39:06.280 --> 39:09.034
This has been the strangest night of my life.

39:09.240 --> 39:10.594
You going next, Ray?

39:10.720 --> 39:12.712
What, flatlining? No way.

39:13.280 --> 39:14.794
I'd bring you back out.

39:15.160 --> 39:16.674
Maybe.

39:17.240 --> 39:19.516
You have to admit, I was pretty good
with that defibrillator.

39:19.960 --> 39:21.280
You were okay.

39:22.400 --> 39:25.632
Would it kill you to admit that
I might be just as good a doctor as you?

39:25.800 --> 39:27.075
I never said you were not.

39:27.320 --> 39:29.152
Hey, Marlo, your brother's here.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.151
You have no more experience
than the rest of us.

39:33.280 --> 39:34.760
I do.

39:34.840 --> 39:36.752
I was a firefighter in Houston.

39:37.840 --> 39:39.399
Almost six years.

39:41.080 --> 39:42.878
I'm going next.

39:44.640 --> 39:46.518
<i>It was super fun.</i>

39:47.520 --> 39:51.514
I was all-powerful.
I had the whole city to myself.

39:52.920 --> 39:54.718
It's weird, isn't it?

39:56.960 --> 40:00.237
I thought there'd be more people, like...

40:00.720 --> 40:02.518
Aren't you supposed to see...

40:02.600 --> 40:04.398
Family members who've died, or...

40:06.600 --> 40:10.594
Maybe there's no one there
because it wasn't really our time.

40:13.800 --> 40:15.359
Was it all fun?

40:17.200 --> 40:18.350
What do you mean?

40:19.560 --> 40:23.474
I don't... I mean, like,
was there anything disturbing or...

40:25.920 --> 40:27.752
Not really.

40:28.480 --> 40:29.914
Why?

40:34.560 --> 40:35.676
Nothing.

40:50.080 --> 40:51.753
She's stabilizing.

40:52.080 --> 40:53.355
I don't understand,
the data shows her starting

40:53.480 --> 40:55.676
into a massive seizure,
and then it just went away.

40:56.200 --> 40:57.919
I gave her Ativan.

40:58.320 --> 40:59.913
On whose authority?

41:01.440 --> 41:03.909
I'm sorry. I'll get approval next time.

41:04.960 --> 41:06.394
You saved her life.

41:11.920 --> 41:13.274
Yes, I did.

41:15.520 --> 41:16.715
I'm Jesus.

41:17.320 --> 41:19.835
Everyone I touch today, I'm gonna heal.

41:19.960 --> 41:23.795
You know, it's funny,
because you and Courtney both flat...

41:27.440 --> 41:28.715
You both flatlined,

41:28.840 --> 41:31.275
yet Courtney is focused on the past,

41:31.840 --> 41:33.399
memories, recipes.

41:33.560 --> 41:38.032
Whereas you, you're focused on
the present, using your intuition.

41:38.160 --> 41:40.550
What does that have in common with Courtney?

41:41.560 --> 41:43.199
Sophia, Marlo, you're needed in the ICU.

41:44.360 --> 41:45.999
It's an awakening.

41:47.680 --> 41:49.034
See you later, Jesus.

41:52.200 --> 41:54.396
- An awakening?
- Yeah.

42:15.640 --> 42:16.960
You here for the abortion?

42:19.760 --> 42:21.592
Should Ernesto La Paz get morphine?

42:29.480 --> 42:30.755
I'll check with the resident.

42:39.640 --> 42:41.472
Sophia? Where are you going?

42:42.160 --> 42:43.310
It's 11:30 at night.

42:43.400 --> 42:45.437
You're not on call,
and you don't have anything scheduled.

42:45.520 --> 42:47.159
No, I'm going to the library.

42:47.280 --> 42:48.430
I'm just gonna do some more studying.

42:48.560 --> 42:49.550
No, no, no, no.

42:49.640 --> 42:51.916
I'm making tea,
and we're gonna start reviewing

42:52.000 --> 42:53.719
all of the terminology
for the nervous system.

42:55.040 --> 42:56.315
- But I...
- Now.

43:00.800 --> 43:01.790
Okay.

43:02.200 --> 43:03.316
Where's Sophia?

43:03.400 --> 43:05.517
We need to start. It's already 12:15.

43:05.600 --> 43:07.239
This isn't gonna hurt, is it?

43:07.320 --> 43:09.198
The anesthesia will take care of that.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.036
Three minutes.

43:11.120 --> 43:12.600
Well, Jamie only did two.

43:12.680 --> 43:13.670
What can I say?

43:13.880 --> 43:14.870
I'm competitive.

43:15.680 --> 43:17.000
After my three minutes are done,

43:17.080 --> 43:19.595
these are the interventions I want,
in their specific order.

43:20.200 --> 43:22.431
If I don't come out right away,
I want you to intubate me.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.353
Force the oxygen, okay?

43:24.440 --> 43:26.477
Hey, I'm gonna bring you out of it.

43:27.320 --> 43:29.516
Relax. Enjoy the experience.

43:30.600 --> 43:31.795
Okay, okay.

43:34.600 --> 43:35.920
Infusion's flowing.

43:38.200 --> 43:40.556
She's out. Body temp's 94.

43:40.680 --> 43:42.160
Charging 200.

43:56.560 --> 43:57.676
Clear.

44:06.760 --> 44:07.876
Asystole.

44:56.320 --> 44:58.471
38-year-old male,
stung in the face by a jellyfish.

44:58.600 --> 45:00.080
...by a jellyfish.

45:04.680 --> 45:06.273
That's it. Let's get her out.

45:10.120 --> 45:11.110
Epi in.

45:12.040 --> 45:13.633
- <i>Defib!</i>
- <i>Charge to 200.</i>

45:13.880 --> 45:14.996
Clear.

45:25.560 --> 45:27.392
- No pulse.
- Damn it, we just had it.

45:27.520 --> 45:28.556
Juice her again.

45:40.880 --> 45:43.998
I'm gonna push an epi and sodium bicarb.

45:49.600 --> 45:51.239
<i>Defib. She's not stabilizing.</i>

45:51.800 --> 45:53.029
<i>Charge 300.</i>

45:53.120 --> 45:54.952
Clear. Come on.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.116
No pulse.

45:58.440 --> 46:00.477
This is not working. I need to intubate.

46:03.040 --> 46:04.713
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey.

46:04.800 --> 46:06.120
Calm down. I got this.

46:12.320 --> 46:13.993
<i>360. Clear.</i>

46:14.360 --> 46:15.510
Please.

46:29.760 --> 46:30.989
She's back.

46:46.080 --> 46:47.673
You good? You're all right.

46:47.760 --> 46:49.558
- Yeah.
- There you go.

46:50.240 --> 46:52.197
We're safe. No one ever comes up here.

46:53.760 --> 46:55.672
- It's so beautiful.
- Isn't it?

46:56.080 --> 46:57.309
Her temp's low.

46:57.760 --> 46:59.035
Pulse still racing.

46:59.640 --> 47:01.393
Well, I think three minutes is too long.

47:01.480 --> 47:03.233
Look, she had a bad trip, it happens.

47:03.400 --> 47:04.516
What, you're an expert?

47:05.360 --> 47:06.953
Yeah, more than you.

47:07.440 --> 47:09.352
- Is she okay?
- Where have you been?

47:09.560 --> 47:11.438
- Marlo is fine.
- Yeah, I'll be okay.

47:11.800 --> 47:13.075
I'm going next. Right now.

47:13.760 --> 47:15.160
- Right now?
- Why not?

47:15.560 --> 47:17.870
The cleaning crew is gonna be
down there in like 20 minutes.

47:18.240 --> 47:19.879
- Okay.
- No, we've gone too far.

47:20.160 --> 47:21.196
No more flatlining.

47:21.320 --> 47:23.277
Okay, so you three get to
expand your consciousness

47:23.400 --> 47:25.392
and get academic advantage, but I don't?

47:25.480 --> 47:26.470
Advantage.

47:26.560 --> 47:27.914
You think this makes you better, Sophia?

47:28.040 --> 47:29.110
This makes you dead.

47:29.360 --> 47:30.589
You have much more sense than that.

47:30.680 --> 47:34.151
Ray, if this bothers you so much,
then just walk away.

47:34.240 --> 47:36.277
- Well, maybe I should.
- You're not going anywhere.

47:36.360 --> 47:38.317
You're in this as deep as the rest of us.

47:38.400 --> 47:41.916
Okay, look,
I don't care how dangerous this is.

47:42.040 --> 47:43.474
I need this more than any of you guys.

47:44.280 --> 47:47.352
Ray, it's her decision.
Just like it was each of ours.

47:47.760 --> 47:51.310
If Sophia wants to do this,
then we're doing it tonight.

47:53.680 --> 47:55.194
Just don't stay in too long.

48:16.680 --> 48:20.356
<i>A B-plus on a biology exam is not acceptable.</i>

48:20.440 --> 48:21.590
<i>Not acceptable.</i>

48:21.680 --> 48:24.070
<i>That will not get you into
a top-10 medical school.</i>

48:34.880 --> 48:36.109
Someone's coming down the elevator.

48:36.200 --> 48:37.236
- What?
- Get her out.

48:38.160 --> 48:39.310
Come on, come on, come on.

48:40.120 --> 48:41.349
Let's go. Let's go!

48:42.680 --> 48:43.796
Pushing an amp of epi.

48:45.040 --> 48:46.269
Where the hell are you going?

48:48.800 --> 48:50.154
Start compressions.

48:50.720 --> 48:52.074
Please, God, bring her back.

48:52.560 --> 48:53.630
Good thinking, Doctor.

48:53.720 --> 48:54.949
I'm sure that's gonna help.

48:55.400 --> 48:56.390
Epi in.

49:08.320 --> 49:09.470
Pause compressions.

49:09.600 --> 49:10.670
Clear.

49:18.760 --> 49:19.750
Irina.

49:19.880 --> 49:24.318
<i>You are not the only kid
that is out there trying to get in.</i>

49:35.920 --> 49:37.036
Shit.

49:47.760 --> 49:49.319
One, two, three.

49:49.400 --> 49:51.312
- V-tach.
- Charging 360.

50:05.720 --> 50:06.870
Clear.

50:13.280 --> 50:15.158
We got her, we got her.
Let's go, let's go. Come on.

50:16.120 --> 50:17.554
We're gonna get you out of here.

50:17.920 --> 50:18.910
You're gonna be okay.

50:19.320 --> 50:21.516
- Come on, you'll be okay. Come here.
- Come on.

50:21.600 --> 50:23.273
- Come on!
- I got her, I got her.

50:24.800 --> 50:25.950
- My jacket, my jacket.
- Got it.

50:26.040 --> 50:27.110
Go, go.

50:31.880 --> 50:32.870
Okay. To the right.

50:33.440 --> 50:34.430
It's open. Just get in.

50:35.960 --> 50:37.599
- Okay.
- Okay, okay.

50:45.640 --> 50:46.915
Should you really be driving?

50:50.720 --> 50:51.790
Wait!

50:53.400 --> 50:54.390
Shit!

50:56.560 --> 50:58.233
You asshole! You left us.

50:58.680 --> 51:00.353
- Are you okay?
- The hell I did.

51:00.440 --> 51:02.750
- I saved your asses.
- Let's go!

51:02.840 --> 51:04.240
- Here they come!
- Hold it right there!

51:04.320 --> 51:05.470
We got to get out of here!

51:06.440 --> 51:07.430
Hold on!

51:07.880 --> 51:09.030
We're going too fast!

51:11.280 --> 51:12.270
Oh, my God.

51:12.600 --> 51:13.670
- Shit!
- Car!

51:13.760 --> 51:14.830
God!

51:16.800 --> 51:18.075
Watch out!

51:20.320 --> 51:21.470
Oh, my God!

51:24.120 --> 51:25.270
It's not funny.

51:28.760 --> 51:29.910
Here we go.

51:41.440 --> 51:42.669
Where are we going?

51:53.480 --> 51:54.470
Hell yeah.

53:02.120 --> 53:03.190
<i>Courtney!</i>

54:19.640 --> 54:20.790
Come.

54:21.560 --> 54:24.550
Look, I don't know if it's the experience
of dying and coming back again,

54:24.640 --> 54:27.109
but I have got a really
intense craving right now.

54:28.520 --> 54:30.113
For what, gelato?

54:31.120 --> 54:32.270
No.

54:36.360 --> 54:38.477
Oh, my God, this is crazy!

54:41.960 --> 54:43.030
Sophia.

54:43.920 --> 54:45.320
Sophia, open this door!

54:46.880 --> 54:48.678
I think there's someone at the door.

54:49.120 --> 54:50.679
- Sophia!
- I don't care.

54:51.480 --> 54:52.470
Don't stop.

54:52.640 --> 54:54.438
Sophia, I need you to open this door.

54:56.320 --> 54:57.549
Sophia!

55:00.320 --> 55:02.437
It's nice to meet you, Mrs. Manning.

55:08.520 --> 55:10.591
How dare you bring someone
back to my apartment.

55:10.680 --> 55:11.909
I'm moving out.

55:13.160 --> 55:14.913
- What did you say?
- I'm finding my own place.

55:15.600 --> 55:16.590
You will do no such thing.

55:16.720 --> 55:18.552
See, it doesn't matter what you say, Mom.

55:19.200 --> 55:22.238
Whatever threats you make. I'm 25 years old.

55:22.320 --> 55:24.152
Succeed or fail...

55:24.840 --> 55:26.320
I'm doing it on my own.

55:27.800 --> 55:29.120
Good night.

55:43.880 --> 55:45.075
All right.

55:47.520 --> 55:49.034
Good night.

55:50.240 --> 55:51.469
How are you getting home?

55:51.880 --> 55:53.519
There's a metro stop nearby.

55:55.360 --> 55:57.397
Look, there's something I need to tell you.

56:00.240 --> 56:01.594
It's important.

56:08.320 --> 56:09.640
So, you gonna tell me or what?

56:09.760 --> 56:10.796
I killed someone.

56:12.120 --> 56:13.156
What?

56:15.320 --> 56:16.913
It was two months ago.

56:17.000 --> 56:18.957
It was my ER rotation.

56:20.760 --> 56:22.558
The patient's name was Cyrus Gudgeon.

56:22.640 --> 56:24.597
He was admitted for a jellyfish sting.

56:25.400 --> 56:28.393
Cyrus Gudgeon. Yeah, I remember.
He got stung in the face.

56:29.200 --> 56:30.270
Died of shock, right?

56:30.360 --> 56:33.512
No, he died because of a mistake that I made.

56:34.080 --> 56:36.117
I gave him epi and Benadryl.

56:36.360 --> 56:38.352
But those two drugs don't cross-react.

56:38.440 --> 56:40.193
He had metoprolol in his system.

56:40.640 --> 56:42.359
He basically suffocated to death.

56:43.960 --> 56:47.078
I'd been on duty for, like, 36 hours,

56:47.160 --> 56:49.880
and I must have screwed up
and forgotten to ask him

56:49.960 --> 56:51.997
if he was taking any medications.

56:53.320 --> 56:56.597
He would be alive right now
if it wasn't for my mistake.

56:57.000 --> 56:58.275
Why are you telling me this?

56:58.400 --> 56:59.834
Because I saw him.

57:01.160 --> 57:02.879
Cyrus. I saw him in my flatline.

57:03.200 --> 57:04.873
And it must mean something, right?

57:05.240 --> 57:07.550
Hey, mistakes happen to everybody.

57:07.680 --> 57:10.514
Yeah, but I work so hard every single day.

57:10.880 --> 57:12.872
- I do the right thing.
- I'm sure you do.

57:12.960 --> 57:14.792
- I'm not a bad person.
- No, you're not.

57:14.880 --> 57:16.280
I'm not a bad person. I...

57:16.360 --> 57:18.636
- Everything's gonna be fine, Marlo.
- No, I'm scared.

57:19.720 --> 57:21.359
I'm scared.

57:33.040 --> 57:34.440
Wait, wait, wait.

57:34.800 --> 57:36.757
You... You can't just...

57:38.200 --> 57:39.395
I'm... I'm sorry.

57:39.480 --> 57:40.596
Yeah, what am I doing with you?

57:40.680 --> 57:43.115
- I got to go right now. I'm sorry. No...
- No. No, no, no, wait.

58:08.560 --> 58:10.233
- Damn, you have so many.
- Just...

58:10.320 --> 58:11.549
Okay, okay.

58:11.640 --> 58:12.960
I got it, I got it.

59:15.040 --> 59:16.156
Courtney!

59:33.640 --> 59:34.676
Help!

59:35.560 --> 59:37.279
Help! Tessa!

59:37.960 --> 59:38.950
Tessa!

59:43.520 --> 59:44.590
Help!

59:46.400 --> 59:47.436
My sister!

59:47.560 --> 59:49.074
Help!

59:49.840 --> 59:51.240
My sister!

59:51.840 --> 59:53.160
- My sister.
- Come on.

59:53.240 --> 59:54.640
No! My sister!

59:54.720 --> 59:57.838
Tessa! My... Tessa!

59:57.920 --> 59:59.354
No!

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:11.274
I hope this doesn't become awkward.

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:14.755
Too late.

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:18.594
I can't imagine what you must think of me.

01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:20.390
Why?

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:23.191
Well, first I tell you that I'm responsible

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:24.999
for the death of a patient,

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:28.073
and then I go and totally attack you.

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:30.994
I mean, seriously, what...

01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:33.953
What do you see in me?

01:00:35.640 --> 01:00:37.233
You're really hot.

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:41.274
Shut up.

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:48.594
I got to go.

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:49.716
Yeah.

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:52.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:01.360
It was four months into our first year.

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.511
You were assisting at the oncology ward.

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:07.799
A breast cancer patient was there
for her first round of chemo.

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:12.079
She was anxious and scared,
but you sat down and calmed her

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:15.153
by asking about her kids, her job.

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:17.072
You were so kind.

01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:19.720
You didn't think anyone was watching,

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:23.555
but I was watching you through the door.

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:27.314
Three hours later, I stopped by,

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:32.876
and you were there checking on her again.

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:37.640
That's what I see in you.

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:26.473
<i>Jamie?</i>

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:29.553
Courtney? What's going on?

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:31.233
I saw my sister.

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:33.760
What?

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:35.513
At the waterfront.

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:37.794
It was her.

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:40.397
I saw my dead sister.

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:42.199
Where... Where are you?

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:44.317
I'm home.

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:46.073
<i>I don't understand what's happening.</i>

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:47.514
Stay there.

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:49.000
I'm coming over.

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:32.916
<i>I just... I miss my sister.</i>

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:37.554
I should have told you all that

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:41.270
this wasn't about

01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:44.080
science or discovery.

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:51.680
I think I'm going crazy.

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:55.193
Like I'm seeing things.

01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:58.433
Something I did.

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:03.474
It was my fault.

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:07.833
I'm sorry.

01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:58.275
Tessa?

01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:07.479
Tessa, is that really you?

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:20.234
Tessa, are you okay?

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:47.030
- What are you?
- <i>Courtney!</i>

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:51.271
<i>Courtney!</i>

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:06.359
Let's go!

01:09:47.399 --> 01:09:49.676
Hi. An update on room four.

01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:52.992
We've given the Lasix bolus,
and the output is limited.

01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:01.159
It's been less than 50 cc's
in the last two hours.

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:06.275
All right.

01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:16.032
They found her at
the bottom of a fire escape.

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:17.759
We'll know more after the autopsy,

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:19.797
but right now, it's unclear whether she fell,

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:22.554
jumped, or God knows what.

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:27.270
I know you all liked her.

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:30.034
And I'm sorry, but for now, I need you

01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:32.675
to pick up her patient load
and divide it amongst yourselves.

01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:34.319
We still have a hospital to run.

01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:44.358
Do any of you know what might
have been going on with her?

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:48.036
Is there something you're not telling me?

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:53.600
All right.

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:06.320
It just doesn't feel real.

01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:07.720
I know.

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:12.117
You know, I can't believe she's gone.

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:17.712
We need to talk.

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:22.352
Okay, something is happening to us,
and my mind is playing tricks on me.

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:24.159
This morning,
when I was swimming in the pool...

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:26.277
I can't talk, okay?

01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:28.431
- I have rounds right now.
- Guys,

01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:31.354
Wolfson already knows
we're holding something back.

01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:33.796
The school is going to investigate her death.

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:35.872
I don't believe it was a suicide.

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:37.997
Maybe she fell.

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:39.878
You were there.

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:41.679
What happened?

01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:44.234
She never answered the door.

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:46.511
I figured... She went to bed.

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:47.670
Hey, killer party?

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:51.637
You all look like shit.

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:53.120
Hey, listen,

01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:54.998
if the school finds out
we have been flatlining,

01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:57.555
we will be expelled.

01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:00.155
And you can say goodbye to your future.

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:02.994
Any notes you've taken, destroy them.

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:07.120
I'm gonna get into Courtney's apartment,
get her phone, computer,

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:09.112
anything incriminating.

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:11.157
You know, you were right
this whole time, Ray.

01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:13.516
We should've listened to you.

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:15.438
Yeah, that's true.

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:16.914
This isn't on you, man.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.152
You should just walk away.

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:22.391
We'll keep your name out of it.

01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:24.110
No.

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:26.200
I'm not going anywhere.

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:29.916
Whatever happens to all of you happens to me.

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:42.355
- Yes?
- <i>Hey.</i>

01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:44.591
Look, bad news.

01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:46.353
<i>Ray and I checked her apartment.</i>

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.750
We found her computer and some notes,

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:50.513
- but not her phone.
- <i>Campus security</i>

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:52.114
- could have gotten there before you.
- <i>Okay.</i>

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:55.238
<i>Assuming you're right
and it's not a criminal investigation,</i>

01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:56.913
then all that stuff stays with her body.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.071
Meaning you can go down there
and look for it.

01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:00.992
Go down where?

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:03.754
Where do you think? The goddamn morgue.

01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:53.840
Okay.

01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:11.750
<i>Marlo.</i>

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:14.429
<i>Marlo.</i>

01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:16.800
<i>Marlo?</i>

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:06.511
<i>Jamie...</i>

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:02.520
<i>Jamie.</i>

01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:02.636
<i>Like I'm seeing things.</i>

01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:05.433
<i>Something I did.</i>

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:08.551
<i>It was my fault.</i>

01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:11.159
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:21.432
<i>Tessa?</i>

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:25.512
<i>Tessa, is that really you?</i>

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.992
<i>Are you okay?</i>

01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:35.399
<i>What are you?</i>

01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:46.752
Jesus Christ.

01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:54.313
What was that?

01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:57.915
She was talking to someone.

01:20:58.040 --> 01:20:59.918
Someone was there.

01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:01.633
You don't know that.

01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:03.552
She could've been hallucinating.

01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:05.279
It didn't sound like that to me.

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:08.478
What if it was Tessa?

01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:11.520
What do you mean?

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:13.876
She saw something. You heard her.

01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:15.519
She said that she did something.

01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:17.279
Something was her fault.

01:21:17.360 --> 01:21:19.238
What if that's it? What if...

01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:22.830
What if our sins are coming for us?

01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:24.320
Sins. That's ridiculous.

01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:26.352
So, what are we gonna do?

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:27.954
What are we gonna do?

01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:29.872
We're gonna tell each other
the goddamn truth.

01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:31.838
That's what we're gonna do.

01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:36.032
There's a girl I... I used to know.

01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:38.475
Alicia.

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:41.678
She was a waitress at my dad's country club.

01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:42.796
Oh, my God.

01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:45.190
- You killed her?
- What? No.

01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:47.397
No, I did not kill anyone.

01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:50.030
I...

01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:53.270
I... I...

01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:54.714
I got her pregnant.

01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:58.355
I wanted to help, you know?

01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:02.753
Pay for the abortion, be...
Go with her for the procedure.

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:06.436
Anyway, the... The day came,

01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:08.591
and I... I couldn't deal with it.

01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:11.198
I... I drove right past.

01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:14.512
I left her to fend for herself.

01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:18.517
And she showed up in your flatline?

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.512
I wish that was all.

01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:22.717
She showed up last night, too.

01:22:22.800 --> 01:22:24.871
So you're being haunted
by somebody that's alive.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.356
- What are you talking about?
- This.

01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:29.033
I am talking about this.

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:30.759
Alicia did this to me.

01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:32.837
Only it wasn't her.

01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:35.758
Just like it wasn't Courtney's sister.

01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:37.160
Then what was it?

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:40.360
Jamie, what?

01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:42.432
I... I don't know.

01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:46.349
Something feeding off our guilty conscience.

01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:48.392
What do you mean? Like...

01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:50.995
Something demonic?

01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:54.551
Maybe it's using our pasts, our sins.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.639
Wait, wait.

01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:57.995
We're rational people here.

01:22:58.080 --> 01:22:59.833
You could have stabbed yourself.

01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:01.832
People on drugs hurt themselves all the time.

01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:03.798
There has to be a logical explanation.

01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:05.109
I was 17.

01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:08.750
Her name was Irina Wong,
and she had a higher GPA than I did,

01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:10.513
so I hacked her text messages

01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:14.230
and I sent her naked photos
to the whole class.

01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:16.073
It destroyed her.

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:17.913
What is the point in confessing all of this?

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.071
This is clearly just happening here.

01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:23.551
- That thing...
- Look, look, Courtney said to me

01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:25.996
she thinks maybe we opened a door.

01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:28.276
Wait, so you knew?

01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:31.080
You and Courtney knew there was
a downside to flatlining,

01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:32.799
and... And you still let me and Marlo go in?

01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:34.678
Hey, look, I thought it was
just part of the experience.

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:38.197
Side effects may include dry mouth,
hallucinations, existential dread.

01:23:38.280 --> 01:23:40.351
I did not know that
the side effects would show up

01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:41.999
and start hunting us down.

01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:45.033
There is a scientific explanation
to all of this.

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:47.351
We're way beyond explanations.

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:48.840
Okay.

01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:51.191
If Courtney was right,

01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:53.556
whatever's happening to us,

01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:56.792
these hallucinations, these hauntings,
whatever it is,

01:23:56.880 --> 01:23:59.076
it's only gonna get worse.

01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:00.913
Until we figure it out,

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:04.630
until we figure out what to do,

01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:10.114
whatever killed her
is gonna kill all of us, too.

01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:23.034
Note the negative mass effect
secondary to the encephalomalacia.

01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:26.471
There are multiple foci of high
T2 and FLAIR signal intensity

01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:28.233
in the supratentorial white matter.

01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:30.880
These findings are nonspecific,
but most in keeping with

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.798
chronic microangiopathic changes.

01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:34.718
You'll note there's no hydrocephalus.

01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:36.957
There's no brain herniation.
The vessels are well seen.

01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:40.797
You'll note that the gray matter

01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:43.270
differentiation is completely maintained.

01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:46.671
You little slut.
I can't believe you slept with him.

01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:48.399
Not only are you a hopeless grind,

01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:51.911
but you're an immature,
whiney, crybaby bitch.

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.640
- Okay, stop!
- Excuse me?

01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:00.436
Sorry. Sorry.

01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:03.876
No.

01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:05.474
No! No! No!

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:06.914
No!

01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:09.236
No.

01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:23.080
No.

01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:31.590
No.

01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:40.510
No.

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:46.837
Stop!

01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:48.877
Stop! No!

01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:50.950
No!

01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:54.878
Stop! No!

01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:42.270
Hey.

01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:43.750
Hey.

01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:47.716
What are you doing here?

01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:50.269
Have you seen Cyrus Gudgeon lately?

01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:52.352
If that's supposed to be a joke,

01:27:52.440 --> 01:27:54.079
- it's not funny.
- It's not a joke.

01:27:55.400 --> 01:27:56.754
Then what?

01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:00.275
I pulled the autopsy report.

01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:02.317
It says nothing about metoprolol.

01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:07.759
So then I went back to the original
path lab notes of the blood test,

01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:09.832
and there it was.

01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:12.560
Metoprolol.

01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:15.074
I'm going inside.

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:18.911
Why wouldn't the autopsy report
match with the notes, Marlo?

01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:21.550
Marlo?

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:27.871
Marlo.

01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:31.078
Did you change that autopsy report?

01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:34.511
I had to protect myself.

01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:38.192
Protect yourself? Really?

01:28:38.280 --> 01:28:40.272
By making it look like he died from a sting

01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:41.919
and not a drug you administered?

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.400
I know.

01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:47.394
- I know. It was wrong of me.
- You got to tell someone.

01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:50.279
- I am. I'm telling you.
- The dean, Marlo.

01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:52.397
You have to tell the dean
you changed that report.

01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:53.470
Why?

01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:55.631
- What good is that gonna do now?
- Really?

01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:57.120
You don't see it?

01:28:57.200 --> 01:28:58.793
It's your flatline, Cyrus Gudgeon.

01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:03.397
You know, it was so nice being with you

01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:07.633
and realizing, after all this time,
that you actually like me.

01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:09.632
And now you have to go and spoil it.

01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:12.315
- I am here because I like you.
- Yeah, well, it's easy for you.

01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:14.551
You don't have to sacrifice anything.

01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:18.919
I'm becoming a doctor
with a degree from a top medical school.

01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:21.032
I've worked my whole life for this.

01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:25.034
And now, I... I made one mistake.
I mean, admitting it

01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:26.679
is not gonna bring the guy back.

01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:29.195
All it's gonna do is end my career.

01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:33.915
That is the point here,

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.753
your career.

01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:44.111
If you were willing to change
an autopsy report, then...

01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:46.474
Say it.

01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:51.880
Then maybe you shouldn't be a doctor.

01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:03.352
Hi. Is this Beverly Wong?

01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:07.310
Beverly Wong from East Hadley?

01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:08.990
It is?

01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:13.351
Do you have a daughter named Irina?

01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:19.075
Hey.

01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:20.799
Thanks for coming with me.

01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:23.600
Could you have rented a smaller car?

01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:32.515
You're sure it's the same Irina?

01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:42.349
Irina.

01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:43.635
Yes.

01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:45.120
It's Sophia.

01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:48.238
From East Hadley.

01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:50.516
We went to the same high school.

01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:53.911
I'm sorry. I know, it... It's...
It's been forever.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.070
I...

01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:59.470
I really needed to talk to you,
so I was hoping we could sit down...

01:30:59.560 --> 01:31:01.199
What is this about?

01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:07.830
You never knew this, but...

01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:14.198
I was the one who sent your pictures
to the whole class.

01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:19.480
That was me.

01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:23.918
I can't stand myself to think about it.

01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:27.238
Bottom line, it was
an awful thing to do. I know that.

01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:29.118
What do you want?

01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:33.400
I'd like you to accept my apology.

01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:37.194
It's not necessary.

01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:39.954
Okay? I've moved on.

01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:42.077
Irina... This is important, okay?

01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:43.958
I am so sorry.

01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:47.758
Irina, please.

01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:57.120
Sophia.

01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:10.075
I forgive you.

01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:16.074
Thank you.

01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:25.914
What'd she say?

01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:28.834
<i>Hey, Marlo, it's Jamie.</i>

01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:31.640
- Hey.
- <i>Look, we're just kind of riffing here,</i>

01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:33.359
but maybe you find whoever you've wronged,

01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:36.718
whatever you're feeling guilty about,
and you take responsibility.

01:32:36.800 --> 01:32:38.393
<i>I mean, look, who knows if it'll work?</i>

01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:41.359
<i>But what have we got to lose?</i>

01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:06.236
Alicia!

01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:08.196
Alicia.

01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:11.114
Hey. It's... It's me.

01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:13.192
It's Jamie.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:23.434
What are you doing here, Jamie?

01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:29.114
He's your son?

01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:35.075
Hey. Hey... I came to apologize.

01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:37.117
For taking off on you.

01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:40.318
I... I panicked. I was a coward.

01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:42.710
I should have been there for you.

01:33:42.800 --> 01:33:44.996
But you weren't.

01:33:46.240 --> 01:33:47.515
Look, I...

01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:50.075
I want to make amends.

01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:51.753
Do what's right.

01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:53.672
Help... Help you out.

01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:55.592
Whatever you need.

01:33:57.080 --> 01:33:58.400
Alicia.

01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:02.520
Who is that man, Mommy?

01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:28.549
What?

01:35:56.960 --> 01:35:58.110
What the hell?

01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:17.430
Sophia?

01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:18.954
<i>I just got a message from Marlo.</i>

01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:21.191
<i>Something's wrong. And her phone is off.</i>

01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:22.680
We need to find her.

01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:24.274
Okay. Where are you?

01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:26.079
I'm... I'm gonna come to you.

01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:27.230
Marlo?

01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:29.760
Marlo!

01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:31.957
<i>She's not here, man.</i>

01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:33.315
Wait. Wait!

01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:36.436
Marlo?

01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:39.518
Forget it. She's here.

01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:41.114
<i>Come as fast as you can!</i>

01:36:43.080 --> 01:36:44.434
I'm nearly there.

01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:45.874
You got to hurry.

01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:47.155
Ray!

01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:50.000
She must be down there. Come.

01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:51.753
Okay.

01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:54.596
Come on!

01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:07.995
- Oh, my God.
- No, no, no, no, no!

01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:09.673
Oh, my God. How long has she been under?

01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:12.315
It's been over four minutes.

01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:13.720
- BVM?
- Sure.

01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:16.635
Come on. We need oxygen!

01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:30.115
Cyrus. I'm so sorry.

01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:32.674
Forgive me.

01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:35.917
Will you please forgive me?

01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:41.870
No pulse.

01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:45.197
Take over the compressions.

01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:47.272
Go, go, go!

01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:49.399
It's not working. Shit.

01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:17.480
Stop.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:24.639
Nothing.

01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:06.833
Ray.

01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:25.316
Marlo, don't you get it?

01:40:27.160 --> 01:40:29.072
I need you to come back.

01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:33.635
To me.

01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:42.834
<i>Marlo, Marlo...</i>

01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:51.634
<i>Marlo? Marlo.</i>

01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:22.955
No! No!

01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:29.274
<i>Marlo.</i>

01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:34.156
You have to forgive yourself.

01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:37.674
Forgive yourself, Marlo.

01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:38.796
No!

01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:42.755
Charge 360.

01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:12.600
Okay. Okay.

01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:14.114
Oh, my...

01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:19.796
It's okay. It's okay.

01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:25.029
Hey.

01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:32.556
Here.

01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:33.960
There you go.

01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:37.680
Thank you.

01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:43.160
You okay?

01:42:44.040 --> 01:42:45.235
Yeah.

01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:47.312
I found the girl.

01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:52.318
And a little boy.

01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:54.275
Yeah.

01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:57.754
The hell with going to L.A.

01:42:57.840 --> 01:43:00.116
I'm getting a residency right here.

01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:02.715
Be near them.

01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:05.953
I'm gonna try.

01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:13.517
<i>Courtney was right.</i>

01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:15.717
<i>It's not enough to apologize.</i>

01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:18.315
<i>We have to face up to what we've done,</i>

01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:21.074
<i>and then forgive ourselves.</i>

01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:24.794
<i>Some lines should not be crossed.</i>

01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:27.270
<i>We lost a friend.</i>

01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:29.996
<i>We will never be the same.</i>

01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:33.115
Where were you?

01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:34.839
I talked to the dean.

01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:36.559
How'd it go?

01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:38.313
I'm on probation.

01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:41.831
Did you bring it?

01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:45.274
Here.

01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:03.840
Only Courtney knows now.

01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:18.311
Feels so weird just being here
without Courtney.

01:44:22.880 --> 01:44:24.872
Anyone want to say something?

01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:27.598
Let's just get hammered.

01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:32.070
Why don't you say something?

01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:10.393
To Courtney.

01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:13.633
To Courtney.
