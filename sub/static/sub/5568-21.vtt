00:03.104 --> 00:06.005
Big windows, lots of light,
finished basement.

00:06.007 --> 00:08.288
Why has this place been
sitting on the market so long?

00:09.276 --> 00:12.277
It's a buyer's market,
as we have discovered.

00:12.279 --> 00:13.345
Tough time to sell.

00:13.347 --> 00:14.613
Is that why you reduced

00:14.615 --> 00:15.714
the price several times?

00:18.953 --> 00:20.619
You're really getting a steal.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.454
Oh, I saw the patchwork
in the basement.

00:22.456 --> 00:23.889
Do you have termite trouble?

00:25.059 --> 00:26.625
Termites?

00:26.627 --> 00:30.162
Well, this house is
such a hospitable environment,

00:30.164 --> 00:32.164
who<i> wouldn't</i> want to live here?

00:32.166 --> 00:33.165
(laughs)

00:33.167 --> 00:35.167
So, what do you say?

00:35.169 --> 00:36.668
You know, you've done a good job
renovating,

00:36.670 --> 00:40.305
and it's a great deal, so...

00:41.675 --> 00:43.008
I'll take it. Oh!

00:43.010 --> 00:44.376
(women laughing, cheering)

00:44.378 --> 00:45.511
Boo-yah!

00:45.513 --> 00:47.079
Smart!

00:47.081 --> 00:50.249
You and your family
will be very, very happy here.

00:50.251 --> 00:51.216
Oh. Oh, no.
I'm not gonna live here.

00:51.218 --> 00:52.718
I'm gonna rent it out.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.521
In this market, renting's where
the real money's at.

00:55.523 --> 00:57.923
This place is gonna pay
for itself a dozen times over.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.661
Get out of my house! All right!

01:02.663 --> 01:04.196
Bye-bye. (Door slams)

01:26.387 --> 01:29.388
Jessica, we've been trying
to sell this house for months.

01:29.390 --> 01:31.390
We've been through
Halloween vandals,

01:31.392 --> 01:32.958
black mold, termites.

01:32.960 --> 01:36.862
Exactly. And after all that,
we're only gonna break even.

01:36.864 --> 01:40.265
We're supposed to<i> make</i> money
on this house.

01:40.267 --> 01:43.368
And if we rent it out, we<i> will.</i>

01:43.370 --> 01:45.204
"We" rent it out?

01:45.206 --> 01:46.605
That man was right.

01:46.607 --> 01:49.374
Why buy a sickly cow
and fatten it up

01:49.376 --> 01:50.542
and then sell it for beans?

01:50.544 --> 01:51.777
No.

01:51.779 --> 01:54.646
You milk that cow every month...

01:54.648 --> 01:56.115
for 300 years.

01:57.251 --> 01:59.418
But we don't know anything
about being landlords.

01:59.420 --> 02:01.753
You have to find tenants,
hire a real-estate attorney,

02:01.755 --> 02:03.422
contracts, credit checks,
handyman...

02:03.424 --> 02:05.457
Eh, that's all fluff.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.493
We just need to find
the right tenants.

02:07.495 --> 02:10.162
I will take care of everything.

02:10.164 --> 02:12.664
All you have to do is sit back

02:12.666 --> 02:15.901
and let the rent checks roll in.

02:17.071 --> 02:18.303
(Eddie laughs)

02:18.305 --> 02:20.272
Oh, I love
doing crosswords with you.

02:20.274 --> 02:22.674
Such a great way
for us to spend time together.

02:22.676 --> 02:25.110
Dad! We found
the missing TV remote!

02:25.112 --> 02:26.778
Oh, thank God.
These are so boring.

02:26.780 --> 02:27.746
Where was it?

02:27.748 --> 02:29.915
This was a tough case.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.517
Some remotes
don't want to be found.

02:31.519 --> 02:34.019
First, we had to rule out
the obvious suspects...

02:34.021 --> 02:36.622
Couch cushions, the magazine
holder in the bathroom,

02:36.624 --> 02:38.757
Grandma...
But they all checked out.

02:38.759 --> 02:40.292
So where was it?

02:40.294 --> 02:41.927
You left it in the pantry.

02:41.929 --> 02:44.596
The... pantry? That's... odd.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.198
I...don't go in the pantry.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.300
I believe you<i> do</i> go
in the pantry...

02:48.302 --> 02:51.770
To cry after you watch
a certain movie called "Babe."

02:51.772 --> 02:53.705
"That'll do, pig.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.174
(voice breaking) That'll do."

02:56.477 --> 02:58.810
Well (chuckles)
you found the remote.

02:58.812 --> 03:00.145
Thank you. (Sniffles)

03:00.147 --> 03:02.227
Here's a little something
for your trouble.

03:03.184 --> 03:05.450
EMERY: Thanks, but we don't
do it for the money.

03:05.452 --> 03:07.119
We do it for justice.

03:07.121 --> 03:09.054
But w-we'll take the money,
though.

03:09.056 --> 03:11.323
Another cased solved
by The Huang Boys...

03:11.325 --> 03:12.991
A perfect nine for nine.

03:12.993 --> 03:15.827
Tell your friends.

03:15.829 --> 03:18.110
LOUIS: "Tell your friends."

03:19.466 --> 03:21.667
Yo, Dad, since you're
handing out free money,

03:21.669 --> 03:25.470
this is the Ironman watch,
and I need it on my body.

03:25.472 --> 03:28.340
It has a lap timer,
a stainless-steel case back,

03:28.342 --> 03:31.510
and it's water-resistant
up to 100 meters.

03:31.512 --> 03:33.212
(splash)

03:34.315 --> 03:36.548
Aaaaaaaah!

03:39.086 --> 03:40.085
LOUIS: Ohhh.

03:40.087 --> 03:41.153
So you're a watch guy

03:41.155 --> 03:42.387
like your old man.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.089
(chuckles)
I remember my first...

03:44.091 --> 03:48.327
Gold Casio, mini calculator,
programmable alarm.

03:48.329 --> 03:49.661
You should have seen it.
(chuckles)

03:49.663 --> 03:51.363
Oh, wait. You<i> can</i> see it.

03:51.365 --> 03:52.645
Because it's right here.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.266
(alarm beeping)

03:54.268 --> 03:56.401
Ah. Listen to her sing.

03:56.403 --> 03:59.371
That's the gentle tweeting
of a punctual robot bird.

03:59.373 --> 04:00.872
(chuckles)

04:00.874 --> 04:02.507
I knew you'd feel me, Dad.

04:02.509 --> 04:04.276
So, want to give me cash or...

04:04.278 --> 04:07.012
(chuckles)

04:07.014 --> 04:09.448
(both laughing)

04:18.792 --> 04:20.259
Oh.

04:20.261 --> 04:21.927
¶¶

04:21.929 --> 04:24.730
So... why should I rent to you?

04:24.732 --> 04:27.099
Because I'm a family man,
and my kids come first.

04:27.101 --> 04:28.200
I work for a nonprofit.

04:28.202 --> 04:29.401
I served three tours
in the Navy,

04:29.403 --> 04:30.636
and I'm now teaching...

04:30.638 --> 04:32.437
I'm Jordan.
This is my wife, Raquel.

04:32.439 --> 04:33.939
We filled out your application

04:33.941 --> 04:35.907
and included our college
transcripts and LSAT scores.

04:35.909 --> 04:37.142
Hope that's okay.

04:37.144 --> 04:39.044
LSATs? So you're lawyers?

04:39.046 --> 04:41.413
Well, we're not in law anymore.

04:41.415 --> 04:43.815
We're in medicine now.
It's just much more lucrative.

04:45.119 --> 04:46.451
I suppose it is.

04:46.453 --> 04:48.420
Um, okay. No pets?

04:48.422 --> 04:49.655
Nonsmokers?

04:49.657 --> 04:50.822
No weekend jazz bands?

04:51.925 --> 04:54.726
You seem perfect.

04:54.728 --> 04:56.461
A little<i> too</i> perfect.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.230
Sweetie...

04:58.232 --> 04:59.998
she deserves to know.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.500
I knew it. What is it?

05:01.502 --> 05:03.802
We never want to have kids.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.137
(sighs)

05:08.075 --> 05:09.408
(cartoon playing on television)

05:09.410 --> 05:10.909
(chuckles)

05:13.013 --> 05:14.680
(TV turns off) Father, I'd
just like to follow up

05:14.682 --> 05:15.747
on our conversation yesterday.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.082
(sighs)

05:17.084 --> 05:18.684
You're<i> very</i> close to me
right now.

05:18.686 --> 05:20.752
While I explained the benefits
of watch ownership,

05:20.754 --> 05:22.254
I didn't tell you all the ways

05:22.256 --> 05:24.790
that not having a watch
is ruining my life.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.825
Could you just back up an inch?

05:27.928 --> 05:29.461
When we're ordering pizza,

05:29.463 --> 05:31.863
I have no idea
if it takes 30 minutes or less.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.265
I'm like, "You're late."

05:33.267 --> 05:34.666
The guy's like,
"Where's your proof?"

05:34.668 --> 05:36.435
And I'm like, "Right here."

05:36.437 --> 05:37.669
Oh."

05:37.671 --> 05:40.305
Eddie, don't make everything
about pizza.

05:40.307 --> 05:41.707
This is about responsibility.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.208
I know if I buy you that watch,

05:43.210 --> 05:45.010
you'll wear it for one day,
then toss it aside.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.712
I promise I won't.

05:46.714 --> 05:48.213
I'll tell you what...

05:48.215 --> 05:50.882
If you can take care of my watch
for one week

05:50.884 --> 05:52.617
and prove to me
that you're responsible,

05:52.619 --> 05:55.454
then maybe I'll think about
buying you an Ironman watch.

05:55.456 --> 05:56.621
Yes! Deal!

05:56.623 --> 05:58.123
(grunts)

05:58.125 --> 06:00.325
Now, let me just give you
a quick lay of the land.

06:00.327 --> 06:02.060
Watch out for her light.
It's a little fickle.

06:02.062 --> 06:04.229
She feeds on arm hair,
so be careful.

06:04.231 --> 06:06.231
The 7 button on the calculator
is broken,

06:06.233 --> 06:08.400
so you have to
add the 3 and 4 first.

06:08.402 --> 06:10.001
Or 2 and 5.
However you want to do it.

06:10.003 --> 06:11.403
I don't want
to micromanage that.

06:11.405 --> 06:14.506
Or 8 minus 1.
Whatever. User's choice.

06:14.508 --> 06:15.741
¶¶

06:18.045 --> 06:20.979
<i>You</i> get a Chipwich,
and<i> you</i> get a Chipwich!

06:20.981 --> 06:23.648
Do you know why
it is raining Chipwiches?

06:23.650 --> 06:25.917
Because I just found us

06:25.919 --> 06:29.221
the perfect renters. You did?

06:29.223 --> 06:31.089
Just deposited their check
in my account.

06:31.091 --> 06:33.091
I'll write you both checks
for your share!

06:35.929 --> 06:38.163
This is<i> my</i> money that<i> I</i> earned.

06:38.165 --> 06:40.565
It's not Marvin's money.
It's<i> my</i> money.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.234
I got Honey money.

06:42.236 --> 06:45.537
Good thing I convinced you both
to invest in the property

06:45.539 --> 06:47.839
and convinced you both
to rent it out,

06:47.841 --> 06:49.241
because I'm a visionary.

06:49.243 --> 06:50.609
Oprah.

06:50.611 --> 06:51.610
Gayles.

06:51.612 --> 06:53.178
(telephone rings)

06:54.515 --> 06:56.047
Huang residence.

06:56.049 --> 06:57.382
Is this Mrs. Huang?

06:57.384 --> 06:58.517
Yes, this is she.

06:58.519 --> 06:59.951
I'm calling to inform you

06:59.953 --> 07:02.287
that the check
you just deposited bounced.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.857
What? (Gasps)

07:05.859 --> 07:07.292
I don't understand.

07:07.294 --> 07:08.727
I know it's confusing.

07:08.729 --> 07:11.129
The word "bounce" seems
so positive...

07:11.131 --> 07:12.464
Like Tigger.

07:12.466 --> 07:14.566
I don't understand

07:14.568 --> 07:17.369
how my ear appointment
can be approaching.

07:17.371 --> 07:18.570
(chuckles) It feels like
it was just yesterday.

07:18.572 --> 07:21.640
Okay, well, bye.

07:22.609 --> 07:25.089
Come on, come on.
Write our checks.

07:26.313 --> 07:27.813
Yes.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.383
(smacks lips)

07:31.385 --> 07:33.051
Yes.

07:33.053 --> 07:34.386
Your checks. Ha ha.

07:34.388 --> 07:38.457
Here... you...

07:42.429 --> 07:43.695
(smacks lips)

07:44.631 --> 07:45.697
go.

07:51.605 --> 07:52.838
Yes! Thank you.

07:56.410 --> 07:58.410
(knock on door)

07:58.412 --> 07:59.478
Oh!

07:59.480 --> 08:00.979
Hi, Jessica. Hey.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.181
Hi. So, there's been
some kind of a mistake.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.583
The bank called yesterday,

08:04.585 --> 08:07.252
and they said
that your check bounced.

08:07.254 --> 08:09.287
Oh, you know why?

08:09.289 --> 08:11.122
That's probably because
there's no money in our account.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.024
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's for sure it.

08:13.026 --> 08:14.092
Yeah.

08:21.134 --> 08:23.602
What do you mean,
you have no money?

08:23.604 --> 08:24.769
Eh... Buh...

08:24.771 --> 08:25.704
(both laugh)

08:25.706 --> 08:26.771
It's kind of a long story.

08:26.773 --> 08:28.853
Come in, come in. Come on.

08:29.676 --> 08:32.477
Please, have a seat.

08:32.479 --> 08:34.312
We're having cash-flow problems.

08:34.314 --> 08:36.314
But I thought you were doctors.

08:36.316 --> 08:38.650
(chuckling) Oh, no. God, no.

08:38.652 --> 08:41.386
We were enrolled as guinea pigs
in these drug trials,

08:41.388 --> 08:43.054
but then we got disqualified.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.789
Yeah, when we said
we were in medicine,

08:44.791 --> 08:46.691
I guess, technically,
the medicine was in us.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.894
So, I guess you didn't go
to law school, either?

08:48.896 --> 08:50.529
Oh, no, no, no. We did. We did.

08:50.531 --> 08:52.297
We just... hated it.

08:52.299 --> 08:54.833
It was so long and boring
and expensive,

08:54.835 --> 08:57.135
which is why
we're so deep in debt.

08:57.137 --> 08:59.671
Honestly, we were surprised
you rented the house to us,

08:59.673 --> 09:01.673
especially when you saw
our credit report.

09:01.675 --> 09:03.575
Fffft! Credit checks are fluff!

09:03.577 --> 09:06.411
<i>This</i> is my credit check -
my gut.

09:06.413 --> 09:09.414
Then your gut's as bad as mine
after that trial IBS drug.

09:09.416 --> 09:11.550
Speaking of,
the toilet's backed up.

09:11.552 --> 09:13.318
Can we get the number
for the handyman?

09:13.320 --> 09:14.753
Fluff!

09:14.755 --> 09:16.588
You know what? Forget this.

09:16.590 --> 09:17.889
Pack your...

09:17.891 --> 09:19.324
HONEY (singsong voice):
Knock, knock!

09:19.326 --> 09:21.059
Didn't mean to interrupt,

09:21.061 --> 09:23.562
but we just wanted to stop by
and meet the new tenants.

09:25.198 --> 09:28.733
Yes. These are them...
Our perfect tenants.

09:28.735 --> 09:31.369
Jessica's been raving
about you guys.

09:31.371 --> 09:33.811
Guess who spent her share on
a fancy hat-of-the-month club.

09:40.213 --> 09:41.713
(car alarm chirps)

09:41.715 --> 09:44.049
MALE VOICE: Protected by Viper.
Stand back.

09:44.051 --> 09:45.517
It's nice to meet you.

09:45.519 --> 09:48.119
Want to come in
and play "Geese Lord"?

09:48.121 --> 09:51.423
You know what? We would love to,
but we just can't.

09:51.425 --> 09:53.425
We're very, very busy.

09:59.366 --> 10:00.932
BAREFOOT DAVE:
So, apparently, my dad

10:00.934 --> 10:03.201
has been sending letters
to our old address,

10:03.203 --> 10:05.937
but, honestly, he's been gone
from my life for so long now,

10:05.939 --> 10:07.405
I wonder if I even
want him around.

10:07.407 --> 10:08.773
How do you miss someone who...

10:08.775 --> 10:09.708
Hold up!

10:09.710 --> 10:10.809
Where's my watch?!

10:10.811 --> 10:12.310
Where's my dad?!

10:13.413 --> 10:14.846
¶¶

10:22.489 --> 10:24.155
I lost Dad's watch!

10:24.157 --> 10:25.724
Give us all the details.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.592
I had taken it off to shower
on Saturday.

10:27.594 --> 10:29.160
I know I put it
in a safe place...

10:29.162 --> 10:30.328
On top of G-Dubs.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.631
One witness... Toy glowworm.

10:32.633 --> 10:34.899
And then, I don't remember.

10:34.901 --> 10:36.901
I don't know
if I put it back on afterwards.

10:36.903 --> 10:38.670
Maybe. I don't know!

10:38.672 --> 10:40.639
Client's memory unreliable.

10:40.641 --> 10:43.742
Possible victim of amnesia.

10:43.744 --> 10:46.104
The Huang Boys are on the case.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.413
(glove snaps) We need to
dust for fingerprints.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.148
I'll get the flour.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.249
(sighs)

10:51.251 --> 10:52.584
HONEY: Need a ride?

10:52.586 --> 10:53.918
Oh, is that...

10:53.920 --> 10:55.353
My leased Probe?

10:55.355 --> 10:57.522
Yes. Yes, it is.

10:57.524 --> 10:58.823
She's got a full tank of gas.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.458
If we wanted,
we could probably make it

11:00.460 --> 11:02.260
all the way to N'awlins.

11:02.262 --> 11:03.762
Oh. (Laughs) I can't.

11:03.764 --> 11:06.264
Uh, I-I have to go
check on the tenants.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.800
Turns out there's
a little plumbing issue.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.468
Oh, no.
Well, then, I'll come help.

11:10.470 --> 11:12.937
Oh, no! No, no, no.
It's fine. I got it.

11:12.939 --> 11:16.274
I<i> was</i> gonna go anyway,
because...

11:16.276 --> 11:17.442
(squeals)

11:17.444 --> 11:19.277
I got them
a welcome gift basket.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.179
Oh, perfect!
I'll give it to them.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.782
Oh, that's so nice of you
to think of this.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.216
You know, that's why
we're great partners...

11:25.218 --> 11:26.818
Because you think
of these kind of things.

11:26.820 --> 11:29.154
Now, go to N'awlins,
you nosy bitch!

11:29.156 --> 11:31.723
(laughing) All right.

11:34.961 --> 11:36.995
Hi. How's it going?

11:36.997 --> 11:38.129
Oh!

11:38.131 --> 11:39.731
(laughs) Hey, Jessica.

11:39.733 --> 11:42.634
I was just trying to drive beers
into the living room.

11:42.636 --> 11:44.002
What's up?

11:44.004 --> 11:45.670
If you have money to waste

11:45.672 --> 11:48.873
on pizza and video games
and tiny cars,

11:48.875 --> 11:50.809
you have money for rent.

11:50.811 --> 11:51.910
Move.

11:55.315 --> 11:56.581
(grunts)

11:56.583 --> 11:58.903
No more cable. Nonessential.

11:59.252 --> 12:03.321
No more takeout.
Make your own food.

12:03.323 --> 12:05.757
This is a schedule
for the Florida bar.

12:05.759 --> 12:09.027
You're gonna hit the books
and pass it.

12:09.029 --> 12:10.328
Get real jobs.

12:10.330 --> 12:11.730
Yeah. Okay.

12:11.732 --> 12:12.997
Yeah, I mean,
we're not good with money,

12:12.999 --> 12:14.666
so this is actually
really helpful.

12:14.668 --> 12:17.202
And until you pay me
what you owe me,

12:17.204 --> 12:18.103
you're the handyman.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.671
Fix the toilet yourself.

12:19.673 --> 12:21.940
And fix up the place
while you're at it.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.541
Add value.

12:23.543 --> 12:25.243
Maybe a blueberry patch.

12:26.079 --> 12:27.512
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

12:27.514 --> 12:28.847
¶¶

12:30.584 --> 12:32.851
Sorry, G-Dubs.
We're almost done.

12:32.853 --> 12:35.186
EVAN: I think he likes it.

12:37.357 --> 12:39.691
Boys, I need your help.

12:39.693 --> 12:40.859
I lost Eddie's watch.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.761
Twist.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.096
Talk to us. Well,

12:45.098 --> 12:47.232
on Saturday,
I walked past Eddie's room

12:47.234 --> 12:50.401
and saw he had carelessly
left my watch lying on his bed.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.537
So I took it
to teach him a lesson.

12:52.539 --> 12:53.705
And then I lost it.

12:53.707 --> 12:55.540
Possible irony.

12:55.542 --> 12:56.908
EMERY: Dad,
Eddie took off the watch

12:56.910 --> 12:58.409
because it was his shower day.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.411
His shower day is on<i> Sunday.</i>

13:00.413 --> 13:02.213
He switched it to Saturdays

13:02.215 --> 13:04.048
because he gets so worked up
during "American Gladiators."

13:04.050 --> 13:05.517
(Cheering on television)

13:08.622 --> 13:10.755
Gladiators, ready!

13:10.757 --> 13:13.591
Oh, no.
He just took it off to shower.

13:13.593 --> 13:17.295
I need you to find that watch
before the end of the week.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.963
And whatever you do,
don't tell Eddie.

13:18.965 --> 13:21.933
Permission to extend bedtime
so we can solve the case?

13:21.935 --> 13:25.603
Crime doesn't sleep,
and neither should you.

13:25.605 --> 13:27.572
(chicken clucking)

13:31.144 --> 13:32.143
The hell?

13:32.145 --> 13:33.978
"Fiduciary."

13:33.980 --> 13:35.580
(both laugh)

13:35.582 --> 13:37.749
Why is there a chicken
on the front lawn? Oh.

13:37.751 --> 13:40.952
We took your advice about making
our own food to save money,

13:40.954 --> 13:42.287
so we got some chickens,

13:42.289 --> 13:44.122
and it cut our breakfast budget
to zero.

13:44.124 --> 13:45.323
What are you...

13:45.325 --> 13:46.958
Zero? No kidding.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.326
We had to pay for the chickens

13:48.328 --> 13:49.961
and the materials
to build the coops

13:49.963 --> 13:51.529
and the food
and the vet bills...

13:51.531 --> 13:53.164
We got them microchipped...

13:53.166 --> 13:55.406
So the savings should kick in
in about two months.

13:55.635 --> 13:57.202
Out! Get out!

13:57.204 --> 13:58.503
You two are hopeless!

13:58.505 --> 14:00.271
Pack your bags.
I'm evicting you.

14:00.273 --> 14:03.174
Oh, we're not leaving.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.210
Mnh. Since you made us
study for the bar,

14:05.212 --> 14:07.712
we remembered that we have
these things called rights.

14:07.714 --> 14:10.281
Yeah. Legally,
you can't kick us out.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.050
If you did,
we could have<i> you</i> arrested.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.117
Sorry.

14:13.119 --> 14:15.053
No hard feelings. Here. Uh...

14:15.055 --> 14:17.689
These are for you.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.160
Ohh! They're warm!

14:22.162 --> 14:24.629
I don't want your warm,
homemade butt eggs!

14:24.631 --> 14:26.431
You're gonna love them. Yeah.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.207
¶ Whoop, whoop,
that's the sound of the police ¶

14:36.209 --> 14:37.675
¶ Whoop, whoop,
that's the sound of the beast ¶

14:37.677 --> 14:38.910
¶ Whoop, whoop ¶ (horn honking)

14:38.912 --> 14:40.078
Hey!

14:40.080 --> 14:41.479
¶ Whoop, whoop ¶ Pull over!

14:41.481 --> 14:43.481
¶ That's the sound
of the beast ¶

14:43.483 --> 14:45.083
¶ Whoop, whoop,
that's the sound of the police ¶

14:45.085 --> 14:46.517
Yeah, right there. Stay.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.439
¶ That's the sound
of the beast ¶

14:49.256 --> 14:51.623
¶ Whoop, whoop,
that's the sound of the police ¶

14:54.694 --> 14:57.262
I know I was speeding,
but my sister...

14:57.264 --> 14:59.097
Oh. Hi, Jessica.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.765
Officer Bryson,
I need your help.

15:00.767 --> 15:03.401
I've got deadbeat law students
in my house.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.003
I rented the investment property
to them,

15:05.005 --> 15:06.704
and they refuse to leave.

15:06.706 --> 15:08.706
Oh, so you've got squatters.

15:08.708 --> 15:11.876
That is the perfect, disgusting
word for what they are.

15:11.878 --> 15:13.845
Unfortunately, I can't help you.

15:13.847 --> 15:15.546
The law is very much
on their side.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.048
You can't just turn them out.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.517
So they can just
stay in my house,

15:19.519 --> 15:21.185
not pay rent,

15:21.187 --> 15:23.468
and I can't do anything
about it?

15:24.190 --> 15:26.824
These people are not
my mother-in-law.

15:27.861 --> 15:28.960
So, can I go?

15:28.962 --> 15:31.229
Just remember...

15:31.231 --> 15:33.698
Driving is a privilege. (Knocks)

15:33.700 --> 15:36.167
¶ Whoop, whoop,
that's the sound of the police ¶

15:40.874 --> 15:42.240
Any progress?
We're running out of time.

15:42.242 --> 15:44.809
Good news, Dad.
We heard back from Casio.

15:44.811 --> 15:48.413
Turns out, the watch
was manufactured in 1985.

15:48.415 --> 15:51.382
Your story checks out.
You're no longer a suspect.

15:51.384 --> 15:53.418
Guys! What's going on with...

15:53.420 --> 15:54.886
Dad!

15:54.888 --> 15:56.087
What are you doing here?

15:56.089 --> 15:58.589
Oh, nothing.
Just, uh, coming in to...

15:58.591 --> 16:00.391
ruffle the hair of my boys.

16:00.393 --> 16:02.260
(chuckles)

16:02.262 --> 16:05.063
Oh, well, I also...
came to ruffle.

16:05.065 --> 16:07.665
(chuckles)

16:07.667 --> 16:10.535
There you are.

16:16.242 --> 16:17.809
All right, then. Uh, yeah.
I'll see you later, then.

16:17.811 --> 16:19.644
Yeah, see you around. Oh.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.913
(door closes)

16:21.915 --> 16:23.915
¶¶

16:23.917 --> 16:25.483
You're sure you want me
to shut the power off?

16:25.485 --> 16:27.452
They've left me
no choice, Jerry.

16:27.454 --> 16:29.787
I tried to teach them.
They refused to learn.

16:29.789 --> 16:32.457
I went to the law.
The law turned its back on me.

16:32.459 --> 16:33.925
Shut it down.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.262
Now turn off the water.

16:41.968 --> 16:44.408
Now sic this stray cat
on the chickens.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.506
(cat meows)

16:52.445 --> 16:55.279
She's got the scent.
Send her in.

16:57.617 --> 16:59.317
(meowing)

16:59.319 --> 17:02.553
She's formulating
a plan of attack.

17:02.555 --> 17:03.955
Apex predator.

17:03.957 --> 17:06.224
(meows)

17:06.226 --> 17:07.558
(insects chirping)

17:11.698 --> 17:13.064
No.

17:13.066 --> 17:14.966
Candlelight is so romantic.

17:14.968 --> 17:19.303
And who needs water
when we have ¶ margaritas? ¶

17:19.305 --> 17:22.673
No ice, so they're room-temp,
just like in Mexico.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.509
Mexico's nailing it. (Chuckles)

17:24.511 --> 17:25.810
Mm!

17:25.812 --> 17:28.312
Oh, baby, look. Look at them.

17:28.314 --> 17:29.714
(chuckling) Oh!

17:29.716 --> 17:32.817
(clucking, purring)

17:32.819 --> 17:35.319
Man taught you to hate
each other, but you said no.

17:36.823 --> 17:37.889
Should we have a kid?

17:37.891 --> 17:38.890
Yeah. I want that.

17:38.892 --> 17:40.391
Okay, good.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.593
(both chuckling)

17:42.595 --> 17:45.096
(alarm beeping)

17:45.098 --> 17:46.697
(gasps)

17:46.699 --> 17:48.366
Thank God!
The Huang Boys did it!

17:48.368 --> 17:50.101
¶ Yeah ¶

17:50.103 --> 17:51.869
Well, Dad,
It's the end of the week,

17:51.871 --> 17:54.072
and I still have your watch,
like I said I would.

17:54.074 --> 17:56.374
Well, look at that! Impressive.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.376
I never should have
doubted you, Eddie.

17:58.378 --> 18:01.546
We solved it!
We found the missing watch!

18:01.548 --> 18:02.613
Wait.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.215
If that's<i> your</i> watch,

18:04.217 --> 18:07.251
then... whose watch is this?

18:07.253 --> 18:10.021
It's a new one. I bought it.

18:10.023 --> 18:12.457
I saw my watch
lying in your room,

18:12.459 --> 18:13.758
and I thought
you were being careless,

18:13.760 --> 18:15.293
so I took it
to teach you a lesson.

18:15.295 --> 18:17.595
(alarm beeping)
I shouldn't have...

18:19.532 --> 18:20.765
That's my robot bird.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.733
It isn't
either of<i> these</i> watches.

18:22.735 --> 18:25.203
(beeping continues)

18:26.773 --> 18:29.207
Ma, why do you have my watch?

18:34.914 --> 18:36.781
But I'm<i> your</i> son.

18:36.783 --> 18:39.143
Why are you messing with<i> me?</i>

18:39.419 --> 18:40.818
Mm.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.487
Wait...
If Grandma has your watch

18:42.489 --> 18:45.556
and this is the watch
you bought to replace it,

18:45.558 --> 18:49.327
then whose watch
do Evan and Emery have?

18:50.997 --> 18:53.831
(sighs) We bought it...
With our justice fund!

18:53.833 --> 18:55.399
We'd solved every case,

18:55.401 --> 18:57.561
and we didn't want to ruin
our perfect record.

18:59.739 --> 19:02.073
Looks like the real victim
in all of this

19:02.075 --> 19:03.574
was the truth.

19:03.576 --> 19:05.576
I'm too young for this crap.

19:08.181 --> 19:09.247
Squatters?

19:09.249 --> 19:10.748
They won't leave.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.016
I thought you said that...

19:12.018 --> 19:15.520
I didn't know
how to tell you I was wrong.

19:15.522 --> 19:17.788
I got us into this situation,

19:17.790 --> 19:19.690
and now I don't know
how to get out.

19:19.692 --> 19:22.693
So, those checks you wrote us
came out of your own account?

19:22.695 --> 19:24.962
Yes. (Sighs)

19:24.964 --> 19:26.597
I'm surprised
you were able to cash them.

19:26.599 --> 19:28.366
I signed them
"Montana Moorehead."

19:28.368 --> 19:32.303
I don't understand why you
didn't just tell us the truth.

19:32.305 --> 19:34.372
Because I'm supposed to be
a visionary.

19:34.374 --> 19:36.841
I'm supposed to be Oprah.

19:36.843 --> 19:40.845
You invested your money
in that house because of me,

19:40.847 --> 19:43.347
and it's been
nothing but problems.

19:43.349 --> 19:46.017
I convinced you to trust me,

19:46.019 --> 19:47.418
and I failed.

19:52.392 --> 19:54.358
Did you know Oprah got fired?

19:55.295 --> 19:56.961
What?

19:56.963 --> 20:00.698
Early in her career, from a
local news station in Baltimore.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.234
Did she let that stop her?

20:03.236 --> 20:04.468
Did she give up?

20:04.470 --> 20:06.571
Did she take her lapel mic
and go home?

20:06.573 --> 20:08.239
No.

20:08.241 --> 20:10.308
No. That's right.

20:10.310 --> 20:11.909
She didn't.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.411
And neither will you.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.580
So, this first investment
property didn't work out.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.481
So what?

20:17.483 --> 20:19.016
The next one will.

20:19.018 --> 20:20.751
The important thing
is that you keep going,

20:20.753 --> 20:22.186
and before you know it,

20:22.188 --> 20:24.322
you'll have a horse farm
and your own book club.

20:25.358 --> 20:27.592
Thank you, Honey.

20:27.594 --> 20:31.996
Now I know Oprah can be Oprah
because she has Gayle.

20:32.999 --> 20:35.399
And Gayle can be Gayle
because she has Oprah.

20:35.401 --> 20:37.068
Sure.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.402
Maybe.

20:38.404 --> 20:39.604
No.

20:39.606 --> 20:42.006
Yeah, that was too far.
I felt it.

20:46.346 --> 20:48.713
Okay, so, I know

20:48.715 --> 20:50.715
we made a little less
from the sale than expected,

20:50.717 --> 20:55.386
but at least the squatters
are now the new owner's problem.

20:55.388 --> 20:57.288
Here. Take your share.

20:59.025 --> 21:01.259
Or... reinvest it.

21:01.261 --> 21:03.527
Jessica, I don't know.

21:03.529 --> 21:05.969
I just feel lucky
not to have lost money.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.600
Oh, okay. That's fair.

21:09.602 --> 21:12.570
Here. Take your checks.

21:12.572 --> 21:14.805
Or... reinvest it.

21:14.807 --> 21:17.541
What does Florida have more of
than any other state?

21:17.543 --> 21:19.076
Alligators?

21:19.078 --> 21:20.244
Fuddruckers.

21:20.246 --> 21:22.280
Condominiums.

21:22.282 --> 21:24.949
Or, as I like to call them,
condo-money-ums.

21:26.886 --> 21:29.126
Well, now we<i> have</i> to do it.
