WEBVTT

00:19.587 --> 00:21.689
Hey. There she is.

00:21.722 --> 00:24.558
Mysterious Lady of the East.

00:24.592 --> 00:26.060
Queen of the Ganges.

00:26.094 --> 00:28.162
Our very own Taj Mahottie.

00:28.196 --> 00:30.231
And good racist morning to you.

00:30.264 --> 00:31.699
Wow, that's really good.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.901
You convey such despair.

00:33.934 --> 00:35.236
Thank you.

00:35.269 --> 00:36.537
No, I mean it.

00:36.570 --> 00:37.738
It's really,
really good.

00:37.771 --> 00:39.507
You know, it's,
uh, it's a crime

00:39.540 --> 00:41.709
that you sell that
on the street for peanuts.

00:41.742 --> 00:43.244
It should be hanging
in galleries.

00:43.277 --> 00:44.345
Mm.
You know?

00:44.378 --> 00:46.247
It's too good
to waste on poor people.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.683
Again, thank you, but I'm fine.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.219
What are you doing
up this early?

00:51.252 --> 00:52.686
Usually, you don't emerge

00:52.720 --> 00:54.555
from your bat cave
till mid-afternoon.

00:54.588 --> 00:56.090
Yeah, I brought home
this waitress

00:56.124 --> 00:57.425
from Dugan's last night,

00:57.458 --> 00:59.260
and she stumbled out of here
pretty early.

00:59.293 --> 01:00.561
Figured I'd be a gentleman

01:00.594 --> 01:02.963
and pretend to be asleep
until she left.
Oh.

01:02.996 --> 01:04.265
That's who that was.

01:04.298 --> 01:05.633
I thought you were being robbed

01:05.666 --> 01:07.268
by the ghost
of Eleanor Roosevelt.

01:07.301 --> 01:08.702
(chuckles)

01:08.736 --> 01:10.371
Yeah, I can see that.

01:10.404 --> 01:11.705
You know, I'm just

01:11.739 --> 01:13.574
not in the right head lately,
you know?

01:13.607 --> 01:15.643
I mean, no job, no focus.

01:15.676 --> 01:17.911
Six weeks ago,
I'm top sales rep,

01:17.945 --> 01:22.082
living in a phat condo
in Gotham, and now...

01:22.116 --> 01:25.052
* Da, da-da, dah!

01:25.085 --> 01:26.887
...I live with this.

01:26.920 --> 01:30.057
So? How do I look?

01:30.090 --> 01:32.426
You look very cute, Eric,

01:32.460 --> 01:34.495
but, um, what the hell?

01:34.528 --> 01:37.565
(with English accent):
Say hello to Lord Bartholomew
Gullswallow,

01:37.598 --> 01:38.732
esteemed knight

01:38.766 --> 01:40.768
in the Queens County
Human Chess League.

01:40.801 --> 01:42.136
Ah.

01:42.170 --> 01:44.071
(normal voice):
We play every other Sunday
at Flushing Meadow Park.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.506
Oh, you know what?

01:45.539 --> 01:47.175
You guys should come
and watch some time.

01:47.208 --> 01:48.309
It's pretty exciting.

01:48.342 --> 01:50.344
More exciting
than regular chess?!

01:50.378 --> 01:51.812
As a matter of fact, yes.

01:51.845 --> 01:54.882
It's regular chess
with human-sized thrills.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.485
Gullswallow!
ERIC:
Ah!

01:57.518 --> 01:59.487
Good morrow,
my liege.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.789
You're not gonna
believe our cabdriver.

02:01.822 --> 02:04.825
He actually is convinced
that Viswanathan Anand

02:04.858 --> 02:07.928
and Koneru Humpy should
be ranked above Karpov.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.363
What?!

02:09.397 --> 02:10.598
He's probably drunk.

02:10.631 --> 02:11.999
Anyway, come on,
let's go.

02:12.032 --> 02:14.968
Ugh. I am so frickin' late
for work

02:15.002 --> 02:16.270
again.

02:16.304 --> 02:17.305
Oh!

02:17.338 --> 02:19.707
(sniffing)
Ah.

02:21.542 --> 02:23.611
I'm guessing
you two are together.

02:23.644 --> 02:26.647
Lord Nathaniel Reginald
Derwintwatter.

02:26.680 --> 02:30.351
Or, if you prefer,
you may call me "Carl."

02:30.384 --> 02:33.221
I prefer to go scrape teeth.

02:34.255 --> 02:36.890
Scrape away.

02:36.924 --> 02:38.926
Scrape away.

02:47.735 --> 02:51.272
Rook to king three.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.545
What a game, huh?!

02:57.578 --> 02:59.347
Classic Latvian gambit.

02:59.380 --> 03:02.550
With all that
that implies.

03:02.583 --> 03:04.885
Hey, how's your grandfather?

03:04.918 --> 03:07.755
He's been on his feet
all morning.

03:07.788 --> 03:10.057
I invented the thumb tack!

03:10.090 --> 03:11.859
He's in bad shape.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.561
Poor guy can't even
castle anymore

03:13.594 --> 03:14.695
without getting winded.

03:14.728 --> 03:16.730
Can you keep a secret?

03:16.764 --> 03:19.367
Pawn to bishop three.

03:19.400 --> 03:24.104
He's retiring in two weeks,
naming me the new king.

03:24.137 --> 03:25.739
Congratulations!

03:25.773 --> 03:28.909
Any interest in becoming
my successor as rook?

03:28.942 --> 03:30.711
Me? A rook?

03:30.744 --> 03:35.015
I've dreamed
about it, but... Yes.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.418
Then fix me up with
your neighbor.

03:37.451 --> 03:38.852
Ms. Nuzzolese?

03:38.886 --> 03:40.521
No!

03:40.554 --> 03:43.123
The one I met today. Caryn.

03:43.156 --> 03:48.429
That honey-maned vixen whose
eyes dance with madness.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.097
Rook to king four.

03:50.130 --> 03:52.266
I'm being summoned
to the queenside assault.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.101
I will await your response.

03:54.134 --> 03:55.636
Until we meet again.

04:07.147 --> 04:10.351
(sighs)

04:17.325 --> 04:18.759
I want to rep you!

04:18.792 --> 04:21.495
I have a whistle.
No, I want
to rep you.

04:21.529 --> 04:23.631
Represent you as an artist.
Oh!

04:23.664 --> 04:25.966
Did seem strange that you would
give me a heads-up.
Look,

04:25.999 --> 04:28.602
you need a representative.
I can do this.

04:28.636 --> 04:30.137
What do you know about art?
Hey,

04:30.170 --> 04:32.406
I may not know what
I like, but I know art.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.674
You see what I did there?

04:33.707 --> 04:35.509
Look, you're a great artist,
I'm a great salesman.

04:35.543 --> 04:36.910
Come on, we can do this!

04:36.944 --> 04:39.980
Thank you, um,
but I am doing fine here.

04:40.013 --> 04:42.916
Look, the Mason Hotel
is having a competition

04:42.950 --> 04:44.452
for up-and-coming
artists, all right?

04:44.485 --> 04:48.322
The winner gets $20,000 to paint
a new work for the hotel lobby.

04:48.356 --> 04:50.491
I want to enter you in this.

04:50.524 --> 04:52.960
No, I am not good enough.

04:52.993 --> 04:55.329
I see that "no," and
I'll raise you a "yes."

04:55.363 --> 04:56.330
If they don't accept you,

04:56.364 --> 04:58.599
it's like it never
happened, but if they do,

04:58.632 --> 05:01.134
and you win, you're
$20,000 richer,

05:01.168 --> 05:03.604
minus my industry-standard
commission of 25%,

05:03.637 --> 05:05.639
which you could look
up, but I wouldn't.

05:05.673 --> 05:07.808
Yet again, no.

05:07.841 --> 05:10.210
So, just to same-page it, yes?
No!

05:10.243 --> 05:12.179
Great. You know what? They need
to see a sample of your work.

05:12.212 --> 05:14.515
I'll take this thing.
What?! Hey!

05:14.548 --> 05:15.516
That is $100!

05:15.549 --> 05:18.386
Take it out of my
30% commission!

05:23.424 --> 05:25.058
Please?!
Ew! No!

05:25.092 --> 05:27.327
I am not gonna date
that stupid bishop guy.

05:27.361 --> 05:28.228
He's a rook!

05:28.261 --> 05:30.297
I would never set you up
with a bishop.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.399
That's disgusting.

05:31.432 --> 05:32.566
And besides,

05:32.600 --> 05:33.901
he's gonna be king
in, like, two weeks.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.035
You're always saying

05:35.068 --> 05:36.504
how you want
to marry a successful man.

05:36.537 --> 05:37.705
Can't do better
than a king, right?

05:37.738 --> 05:39.339
Right, but I can do better

05:39.373 --> 05:41.842
than a dweeb who dresses up
like a chess piece.

05:41.875 --> 05:44.211
Aren't you gonna say
"no offense"?

05:44.244 --> 05:46.380
No.

05:46.414 --> 05:47.214
Look at me.

05:47.247 --> 05:49.850
I have been a knight
for ten years,

05:49.883 --> 05:51.852
and it has been my privilege.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.521
But a knight is forever
relegated

05:53.554 --> 05:55.188
to move in an L-shape pattern.

05:55.222 --> 05:57.224
One up, two over.

05:57.257 --> 05:59.427
Two up, one over.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.895
One back, two over.

06:02.930 --> 06:05.065
Two back...
What's your point?!

06:05.098 --> 06:07.535
My point is, I got a chance
to be a rook!

06:07.568 --> 06:11.238
A rook can travel the entire
length of the board in one move!

06:11.271 --> 06:13.907
Bet it feels like you're soaring
on the clouds of heaven.

06:13.941 --> 06:15.909
Or walking ten feet
in a bad Halloween costume.

06:15.943 --> 06:17.077
That's not funny!

06:17.110 --> 06:19.012
All right,
'cause this is my life!

06:19.046 --> 06:21.882
This is not a game!

06:21.915 --> 06:24.051
Okay, I'll go out
with your weirdo friend.

06:24.084 --> 06:24.852
Yeah?

06:24.885 --> 06:26.019
I will not sleep with him.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.021
Ah, you may not want
to say that.

06:28.055 --> 06:31.124
Get a good look
at him in his tights?
(knocking)

06:32.325 --> 06:33.927
Oh. What's up, freakies?

06:33.961 --> 06:36.964
Guess what. Caryn's gonna go
out with my friend, the rook.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.700
Really? Always thought
you'd end up with a dreidel.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.470
Where's Zara?

06:45.305 --> 06:47.875
Very sexy. You should go
with this look more often.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.443
What you want, Stosh?

06:49.477 --> 06:52.312
What would you say if
I told you you're one of

06:52.345 --> 06:55.148
the top five finalists for
the Mason Hotel art competition?

06:55.182 --> 06:57.284
I would say that
you're a lying son of a bitch.

06:57.317 --> 06:59.987
At this moment,
I am merely a son of a bitch.

07:00.020 --> 07:02.422
No! Shut up! What?!
They accepted me?!

07:02.456 --> 07:03.891
Yeah, come on.
(laughs)

07:03.924 --> 07:05.425
What, you don't think
I know what I'm doing?

07:05.459 --> 07:06.560
Of course they accepted you.

07:06.594 --> 07:08.128
And they're gonna have
a reception this Saturday

07:08.161 --> 07:09.730
where they're gonna meet the
artists and pick the winner.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.064
Plus, open bar.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.634
Aah! Thank you so much, Stosh!
Uh-huh. You're welcome.

07:13.667 --> 07:14.968
Oh.
Oh. Wow.
Thank you.

07:15.002 --> 07:16.136
You're welcome.
Thank you.

07:16.169 --> 07:18.338
Look you'll get the
recognition you deserve,

07:18.371 --> 07:21.141
and I'm gonna get my 35%
commission, so it's a win-win.

07:21.174 --> 07:22.943
Need help getting
out of that thing?

07:22.976 --> 07:25.012
No, I'm good.
Okay.

07:25.045 --> 07:27.548
Oh.

07:37.491 --> 07:40.594
ERIC: A rook can travel
the entire length of the board

07:40.628 --> 07:42.095
in one move!

07:42.129 --> 07:43.497
(echoing):
Move... move...

07:43.531 --> 07:47.167
* Take these broken wings
Move... move...

07:47.200 --> 07:51.839
* And learn to fly again,
learn to live so free *

07:51.872 --> 07:55.175
* When we hear
the voices sing... *

07:55.208 --> 07:58.111
The entire length of the board
in one move...

07:58.145 --> 08:01.815
(echoing):
Move.... move... move...

08:01.849 --> 08:06.053
* Take these broken wings

08:06.086 --> 08:07.688
* You got to learn to fly...

08:07.721 --> 08:11.825
A rook... a rook... a rook...

08:11.859 --> 08:15.963
* When we hear
the voices sing *

08:15.996 --> 08:20.167
* The book of love will open up
for us and let... *

08:22.002 --> 08:24.504
MAN: Get off the
chessboard, you freak!

08:24.538 --> 08:26.540
(distant honking)

08:28.341 --> 08:31.545
That's right.
Keep going.

08:31.579 --> 08:33.213
See, the fascinating thing

08:33.246 --> 08:35.549
about noise-cancelling
headphones--

08:35.583 --> 08:38.719
and I spend half my day at Tech
Town explaining this to people--

08:38.752 --> 08:40.688
is that they
work by emanating

08:40.721 --> 08:43.891
sound waves
in the exact frequency

08:43.924 --> 08:46.994
of the ambient noise,
but in 180-degree

08:47.027 --> 08:48.996
opposition to it. Huh?

08:49.029 --> 08:51.832
I wish I had a pair right now.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.500
If you play your cards right,

08:53.533 --> 08:56.937
you may have a pair draped
across your head later tonight.

08:58.138 --> 09:00.173
Annette. I didn't know

09:00.207 --> 09:01.274
you were working tonight.

09:01.308 --> 09:03.243
This is, uh, Caryn, my date.

09:03.276 --> 09:04.111
Hi.

09:04.144 --> 09:05.512
Sorry, I can't talk right now.

09:05.545 --> 09:09.216
I'm swamped. Another waitress
just deep-fried her hand.

09:09.249 --> 09:11.218
She's a pawn
on our human chess team.

09:11.251 --> 09:15.055
Her en passant is
an embarrassment.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.290
I don't know what that means.

09:17.324 --> 09:21.061
Huh. Thought they buried
that with Liberace.

09:21.094 --> 09:23.430
You know Liberace was gay?

09:23.463 --> 09:25.432
Do not repeat that.

09:25.465 --> 09:26.867
(gasps)

09:26.900 --> 09:28.602
Holy Buddha's nipples!

09:28.636 --> 09:31.939
I've never seen one of my
paintings lit professionally.

09:31.972 --> 09:33.573
It looks so good.

09:33.607 --> 09:36.644
Now, look, you are amazing,
all right? You can do this.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.211
You can walk out of here

09:38.245 --> 09:42.049
a commissioned artist
earning $20,000, minus my 40%.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.117
You just got to dance
the dance a little.

09:44.151 --> 09:48.055
Hey, for $20,000, I'll dance
in a G-string and pasties.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.457
Actually, I have,
and for much less.

09:50.490 --> 09:52.960
We should revisit
that subject.
Okay.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.928
WOMAN:
Your work has

09:54.962 --> 09:57.397
such fascinating complexity.

09:57.430 --> 09:58.465
Yes, it is lousy

09:58.498 --> 10:00.934
with fascinating complexity,
isn't it?

10:00.968 --> 10:02.569
Where did you grow up, Zara?

10:02.602 --> 10:03.804
Yonkers.
Mumbai.

10:03.837 --> 10:04.905
STOSH:
Well, eventually

10:04.938 --> 10:07.574
Yonkers, but not until
she had survived

10:07.607 --> 10:08.776
a harrowing childhood

10:08.809 --> 10:11.478
on the streets of Mumbai,
keeping her two younger brothers

10:11.511 --> 10:12.746
out of the hands

10:12.780 --> 10:14.514
of the vicious
Vindaloo cartel.

10:14.547 --> 10:17.017
WOMAN:
Goodness. How did
you manage that?

10:17.050 --> 10:19.920
Oh, um, I hid them
in the Caves of...

10:19.953 --> 10:21.354
Gupta.

10:21.388 --> 10:25.292
Gupta is lousy with caves.
Scotch?

10:25.325 --> 10:27.194
Scotch?

10:27.227 --> 10:29.830
So, our only chance of escape
was to hide

10:29.863 --> 10:31.631
in the wheel well
of the plane.

10:31.665 --> 10:34.935
It was freezing,
but the promise of America

10:34.968 --> 10:38.338
and her freedom kept my brother
and I alive.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.307
I thought you said
you had a second brother.

10:40.340 --> 10:41.174
Oh.

10:41.208 --> 10:42.676
He was upgraded to coach.

10:42.710 --> 10:44.011
Yeah, still, a
terrible ordeal.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.179
No money for headphones...

10:46.213 --> 10:47.715
I believe
there was a crying baby

10:47.748 --> 10:49.750
nearby, so...
Mm-hmm.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.655
(sighs)

10:57.424 --> 10:59.459
Oh!

10:59.492 --> 11:00.694
Oh, God.

11:00.728 --> 11:02.129
So, how did the date go?

11:02.162 --> 11:03.964
I've already repressed
the memory.

11:03.997 --> 11:05.966
You owe me big-time for this.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.869
Absolutely. You are gonna
get a huge mention

11:08.902 --> 11:10.037
in my rook acceptance speech,

11:10.070 --> 11:12.039
unless they play me off
before I get to you.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.907
So, how did you leave things?

11:13.941 --> 11:16.176
He said he was gonna
call me tomorrow.

11:16.209 --> 11:19.179
Eric, I cannot go out
with this freak again!

11:19.212 --> 11:21.348
I had pancakes for dinner!

11:21.381 --> 11:22.716
In what world
is that a bad thing?

11:22.750 --> 11:24.918
Get out of my house. Wait...

11:24.952 --> 11:26.319
how did you get in my house?

11:26.353 --> 11:27.855
The less you know, the better.

11:27.888 --> 11:29.890
WOMAN:
And I'm thrilled

11:29.923 --> 11:31.992
to announce that the winner of

11:32.025 --> 11:35.829
the Mason Hotel
New Artist Grant is...

11:35.863 --> 11:37.865
Zara Sandhu.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.233
Oh, my God!
I knew it, I knew it.

11:40.267 --> 11:42.035
Holy crap, I won.

11:42.069 --> 11:43.403
20,000 bucks.
Yes.

11:43.436 --> 11:45.873
What are you gonna do
with your half?
Ha!

11:45.906 --> 11:47.741
Scotch. Scotch.
Scotch. Scotch.

11:51.078 --> 11:53.580
Watch your step,
watch your step.

11:53.613 --> 11:55.015
(gasps)

11:55.048 --> 11:56.449
Whoa.

11:56.483 --> 11:57.885
That's right,
your Spartan hovel

11:57.918 --> 12:00.220
is now your
Spartan hovel art studio.

12:00.253 --> 12:02.055
Everything you need
to be brilliant.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.623
Brand-new paint, brushes.

12:03.656 --> 12:05.592
I think I'm getting
an art boner.

12:05.625 --> 12:08.728
You are a winner.
Now get to painting.

12:08.762 --> 12:10.931
For art boners
lasting more than four hours,

12:10.964 --> 12:12.465
please consult your physician.

12:17.604 --> 12:19.072
Okay.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.308
Start painting, winner.

12:25.312 --> 12:28.148
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.751
Chicken dinner.

12:35.989 --> 12:38.591
Hey there.
I'm on a chicken break.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.627
Okay.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.798
There's nothing on the canvas.

12:44.832 --> 12:46.466
This is my process, Stosh.

12:46.499 --> 12:49.002
I don't tell you how to be
a giant asshat all day.

12:49.036 --> 12:50.470
Okay, all right, but you do know

12:50.503 --> 12:52.739
we got to turn in a painting
tomorrow, right?

12:52.772 --> 12:53.606
I am on it.

12:53.640 --> 12:56.643
All right.
You get back to it.

12:56.676 --> 12:59.146
Yolo.

12:59.179 --> 13:01.148
All right.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.917
Here we go.

13:03.951 --> 13:06.653
Let's light this candle.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.659
All right, why do I smell
sandalwood?

13:12.692 --> 13:14.694
Go away.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.542
You're painting
the easel.

13:29.576 --> 13:32.112
It looks good, right?
The Mason Hotel

13:32.145 --> 13:34.347
wants a painting.

13:34.381 --> 13:36.016
They won't
accept an easel.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.651
Or... will they?

13:38.685 --> 13:40.187
No.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.389
They won't.

13:43.756 --> 13:45.358
Why can't I paint?

13:45.392 --> 13:47.961
Why can't I paint?
Why?

13:47.995 --> 13:50.197
Why, why, why?
Hey,

13:50.230 --> 13:52.699
Zara, Stosh told me
about the contest.

13:52.732 --> 13:55.869
Oh! Man, what an exciting
time for both of us.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.404
You, about to be
a famous artist,

13:57.437 --> 13:59.339
me, about to be the co-third
most important piece

13:59.372 --> 14:00.874
on my half of the chessboard.

14:00.908 --> 14:02.475
We're in
the spotlight.

14:02.509 --> 14:05.212
Stakes couldn't be higher.
All eyes on us.

14:05.245 --> 14:07.314
We fail, we fail
in front of the whole world.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.582
Well, good luck.

14:09.616 --> 14:12.920
Oh, that's why.

14:12.953 --> 14:14.955
(sighs)

14:17.590 --> 14:19.092
(footsteps approaching)
ERIC: Hey, Caryn.

14:19.126 --> 14:22.495
Aah! Stop being in my house.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.064
I was just checking in.

14:24.097 --> 14:25.832
How are things going
with you and Carl?

14:25.865 --> 14:27.434
Mm, fine.
Yeah?

14:27.467 --> 14:29.036
Got another date
coming up, or...

14:29.069 --> 14:30.570
Not exactly, no.

14:30.603 --> 14:33.173
What? Hey, you didn't
turn him down, did you?

14:33.206 --> 14:34.841
This isn't a done deal
for me yet, Caryn.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.743
I did not turn him down.

14:36.776 --> 14:38.078
Well, then, what?

14:38.111 --> 14:39.579
Oh, God.

14:39.612 --> 14:41.214
He hasn't
called you?
No.

14:41.248 --> 14:42.415
Has he
texted you?
No.

14:42.449 --> 14:43.583
Have you texted him?
Yes.

14:43.616 --> 14:45.585
What did you text?
Smiley face yesterday,

14:45.618 --> 14:47.921
winky face today.
No response.

14:47.955 --> 14:50.090
This is bad. This is so bad.

14:50.123 --> 14:51.925
Wait. Maybe he's dead.

14:51.959 --> 14:53.393
No such luck. I happened to walk

14:53.426 --> 14:54.694
by Tech Town, where he works...

14:54.727 --> 14:56.529
In Staten Island?
Mm. Two buses

14:56.563 --> 14:58.932
and a ferry, what of it?
He was in there.

14:58.966 --> 15:00.633
So he's alive
and he hasn't called you?

15:00.667 --> 15:02.936
He's blowing you off.
Caryn, you told me

15:02.970 --> 15:05.638
the date went good.
Why is he blowing you off?
I don't know.

15:05.672 --> 15:08.942
This is horrible.
I'm no happier about it
than you are, pal.

15:08.976 --> 15:10.477
What do you care? You
didn't even like him.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.779
I didn't like him.
And then he blew me off,

15:12.812 --> 15:15.949
and now I do like him.
Don't you understand?

15:15.983 --> 15:18.218
This is my disease. Ugh.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.786
And it makes
no sense.

15:19.819 --> 15:22.489
How does a guy
like that blow me off?

15:22.522 --> 15:24.291
I was a great date.

15:24.324 --> 15:25.625
I even told him that funny story

15:25.658 --> 15:27.494
from hygienist school--
you know the one--

15:27.527 --> 15:29.562
the one where the teacher
keeps calling me Goldfarm

15:29.596 --> 15:30.964
instead of Goldfarb all year?

15:30.998 --> 15:32.632
That's a terrible story.

15:32.665 --> 15:35.435
You told me you liked it.
I was being polite.

15:35.468 --> 15:38.938
Can't you read a room?
Eric. Eric, wait.

15:38.972 --> 15:41.108
No, Eric, Eric, please,
you have to call him.

15:41.141 --> 15:43.443
No. You're only
gonna make it worse.

15:43.476 --> 15:45.678
One more date.
Ask him.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.180
No. I might still be okay here.

15:47.214 --> 15:48.982
He asked me to fix him up,
and I did.

15:49.016 --> 15:50.950
It's not my fault
you're a giant snooze.

15:52.652 --> 15:55.688
Tell him I'll put out.
All the bases.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.329
All right.

16:02.362 --> 16:03.696
I like what I'm seeing.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.999
How we doing?
You almost finished?

16:06.033 --> 16:07.734
Pretty much.
Awesome.

16:09.136 --> 16:10.270
What the hell is that?

16:10.303 --> 16:12.005
I tried going back
to the basics.

16:12.039 --> 16:16.209
This is the "Draw Me" turtle
from the matchbook ads. See?
This sucks.

16:16.243 --> 16:18.278
I know.
Zara, come on.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.480
Work with me here,
all right?

16:20.513 --> 16:22.215
We got to turn in
a painting tonight.

16:22.249 --> 16:23.683
Please, be a professional.

16:23.716 --> 16:26.186
That's the problem--
I am not a professional.

16:26.219 --> 16:28.788
I am just a person
and I like to paint,

16:28.821 --> 16:31.024
but I can't do it
with all of these people

16:31.058 --> 16:33.560
just watching over me
and expecting some

16:33.593 --> 16:35.328
brilliance
out of me.

16:35.362 --> 16:36.696
You messed with my head,

16:36.729 --> 16:38.965
just so you could get
25% of the money.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.734
Well, I thought we settled
on 35, but that's not the point.

16:41.768 --> 16:44.971
I can't do it. Just...
There's too much pressure.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.473
Just call the...

16:46.506 --> 16:49.342
the hotel people
and tell them that I...

16:49.376 --> 16:51.178
I can't do it.

16:52.245 --> 16:54.381
Fine.

16:54.414 --> 16:56.816
Fine. You know...

16:56.849 --> 17:00.387
You want to blow the best damn
opportunity you've ever had,

17:00.420 --> 17:02.255
then you
go right ahead.

17:02.289 --> 17:03.556
It's ringing.

17:03.590 --> 17:06.126
I thought you were my rep.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.263
Hey, Rachel.

17:10.297 --> 17:12.065
Stosh Lewandoski.

17:12.099 --> 17:15.568
Yeah, hi. Uh, well...
not-not so good, actually.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.870
Listen, I know
it's the 11th hour, but, uh,

17:17.904 --> 17:20.039
unfortunately,
Zara's got to drop out.

17:20.073 --> 17:22.675
Yeah, I know, I know. I know,
I'm sorry, but she's just

17:22.709 --> 17:25.445
got some personal stuff
going on.

17:25.478 --> 17:26.779
Okay. All right, thank you.

17:26.813 --> 17:29.749
Well, I... Thank you
very much. Bye.

17:30.817 --> 17:34.287
Sorry I let you down.
Nah.

17:34.321 --> 17:36.423
No, it's my fault.

17:36.456 --> 17:38.691
You know, I didn't
get you till now.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.761
You don't paint for the world,
you paint for yourself.

17:41.794 --> 17:44.264
You know, it's a personal
expression of your own

17:44.297 --> 17:45.698
isolation and loneliness.

17:45.732 --> 17:48.101
Just you,
in your own

17:48.135 --> 17:51.037
dark little universe.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.140
It-It's okay.

17:53.173 --> 17:55.608
You're back there now.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.788
Two hours should do it.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.661
Knight to king bishop four.

18:21.268 --> 18:22.402
(whispers):
Carl.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.304
Hey, how you doing?

18:24.337 --> 18:26.506
Fine, thanks.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.741
So, uh, this time next week,
you're gonna be king?

18:28.775 --> 18:31.811
Pawn to queen's rook three.
That's pretty exciting.

18:31.844 --> 18:33.813
Yes, it is.

18:33.846 --> 18:37.450
And, uh, I guess
I'll be... I mean...

18:37.484 --> 18:38.851
were you...were you
still thinking

18:38.885 --> 18:40.353
about making me
a rook, or...

18:40.387 --> 18:42.489
Rook to king five.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.557
Excuse me.
Sorry.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.528
Caryn?

18:48.561 --> 18:50.330
Carl. Oh, my God, hi.

18:50.363 --> 18:53.300
That's right, you do this
whole human chess thing, too.

18:53.333 --> 18:55.702
What a dummy, I forgot.
How are you?

18:55.735 --> 18:57.337
Are you stalking me?

18:57.370 --> 18:58.938
Stalking you?

18:58.971 --> 19:00.873
Pawn to bishop three.
Me, stalking you? Yeah, okay,

19:00.907 --> 19:03.510
I'm stalking you.
I am stalking you.

19:03.543 --> 19:05.512
I know. I saw you
crouching in the bushes

19:05.545 --> 19:07.013
outside of Tech Town.
Why are you

19:07.046 --> 19:09.349
ignoring me?
You said you had a great time.

19:09.382 --> 19:10.850
You said you were gonna call me.

19:10.883 --> 19:13.085
Rook to queen's knight five.

19:14.387 --> 19:16.256
Wait.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.525
What are
you doing?

19:18.558 --> 19:19.826
Get back to your square.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.361
Yeah, yeah, in a second.
I just... I need

19:21.394 --> 19:22.862
to know why you
didn't call me back.

19:22.895 --> 19:24.197
Was it
the Goldfarm story?

19:24.231 --> 19:25.465
Because I realized after--

19:25.498 --> 19:27.200
I never
got to the funniest part.

19:27.234 --> 19:28.701
Caryn, you need to get back

19:28.735 --> 19:30.370
to knight three right now.
No.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.972
Carl, please, come over tonight
and I'll make you dinner.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.041
Oh, hey, you like
a nice brisket?
What did she

19:35.074 --> 19:36.976
just say about a dinner?
You told me you were

19:37.009 --> 19:39.646
through with her.
I am. She just showed up here.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.581
Okay, missy, this
does not concern you.

19:41.614 --> 19:43.816
I think it does. I'm his
girlfriend. We had a fight

19:43.850 --> 19:45.985
last week and he just went out
with you to make me jealous.

19:46.018 --> 19:49.522
You went out with me
to make her jealous?

19:49.556 --> 19:51.858
You literally
used me as a pawn?

19:51.891 --> 19:54.527
(short laugh) I thought that was
rather elegant, actually.

19:54.561 --> 19:57.364
That was not nice, Carl.
Caryn's a good person.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.031
And she's very
emotionally fragile.

19:59.065 --> 20:00.767
Go back to your square.
No one wants you

20:00.800 --> 20:04.771
on this part of the board.
(gasps) Oh, no, you did not.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.874
Bring it.
(grunting)

20:07.907 --> 20:10.443
No, Caryn, no.
Get off... Get off her.

20:10.477 --> 20:12.011
You get your hands
off her, Carl.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.581
(grunting)

20:14.614 --> 20:17.250
(everyone growling, grunting)

20:17.284 --> 20:18.418
Bishops don't move that way.

20:18.451 --> 20:20.920
CARL:
I'm filing a formal complaint.

20:20.953 --> 20:22.289
(grunts)

20:22.322 --> 20:24.424
WOMAN: Come on!
Ugh.

20:24.457 --> 20:27.193
There will be disqualifications.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.228
(alarm blaring)

20:43.976 --> 20:46.245
Oh, wow.

20:46.279 --> 20:47.580
Great work, babe.

20:47.614 --> 20:50.417
All right, let's go.

20:50.450 --> 20:51.784
Where are we going?

20:51.818 --> 20:54.086
To the Mason.
They're waiting for this.

20:54.120 --> 20:56.956
We quit. You called
the fancy lady.

20:56.989 --> 21:00.226
No, no, I called Mr. Fong.
He does my shirts.

21:00.259 --> 21:03.262
He was very confused.
Very confused.

21:04.797 --> 21:08.134
Wai-Wait, wait, seriously?

21:08.167 --> 21:10.437
Wait, Stosh, wait up.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.672
Aah!

21:15.842 --> 21:17.977
Eric, I told you, I'm sorry.

21:18.010 --> 21:20.647
A checker. I'm demoted
to a checker for six months.

21:20.680 --> 21:22.148
Are you happy now?

21:22.181 --> 21:24.684
Checkers can be fun. They get
to jump over each other.

21:24.717 --> 21:26.653
Don't you dare take her side.
You know, I really

21:26.686 --> 21:29.589
like what you did here with the
smiley face. It's very artistic.

21:29.622 --> 21:32.925
Happens to be my field.
I'd like to rep you.

21:32.959 --> 21:35.194
Uh, I don't make
the smiley faces. Pancho does.

21:35.227 --> 21:37.397
I don't care,
I'd still like to rep you.

21:41.368 --> 21:43.002
Can't cut my pancakes.

21:44.337 --> 21:47.340
Oh, okay, all right,
okay, all right, okay.

21:47.374 --> 21:48.508
I should have been a rook.

21:48.541 --> 21:49.676
Whoa!
Whoa!
Excuse me.

21:49.709 --> 21:52.278
Guess that means
more pancakes for us.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.480
Good night.

21:53.513 --> 21:55.047
Hmm.

21:55.081 --> 21:57.917
