00:01.709 --> 00:05.250
BLADES:

00:01.709 --> 00:05.250
I can't believe Bumblebee's

00:01.709 --> 00:05.250
coming back to Griffin Rock.

00:05.291 --> 00:09.583
This time, everything's going

00:05.291 --> 00:09.583
to be perfect for my BFF.

00:09.625 --> 00:11.208
BFF?

00:11.250 --> 00:13.458
Bot Friend Forever.

00:13.500 --> 00:16.417
Oh, is there room on the banner

00:13.500 --> 00:16.417
for that?

00:16.458 --> 00:20.542
I think "Welcome Bumblebee,

00:16.458 --> 00:20.542
Hero of the Galaxy" is plenty.

00:20.583 --> 00:22.917
Blades.

00:20.583 --> 00:22.917
Optimus Prime's transmission

00:22.959 --> 00:24.834
indicated that Bumblebee

00:22.959 --> 00:24.834
will not arrive

00:24.875 --> 00:28.375
for another three days.

00:24.875 --> 00:28.375
Way too soon.

00:28.417 --> 00:30.041
I haven't even learned

00:30.083 --> 00:32.417
to play an instrument

00:30.083 --> 00:32.417
for the welcome song yet.

00:32.458 --> 00:35.083
Did it ever occur to you that

00:32.458 --> 00:35.083
Bumblebee might be coming here

00:35.125 --> 00:36.583
for something important?

00:36.625 --> 00:39.417
Visiting me is important.

00:39.458 --> 00:42.375
Yeah. Hah. I wouldn't break out

00:39.458 --> 00:42.375
the balloons

00:42.417 --> 00:43.959
and party hats just yet.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.500
Here's the helium

00:44.000 --> 00:47.500
for the balloons, Blades.

00:47.542 --> 00:48.750
( chuckles )

00:48.792 --> 00:50.417
( groans )

00:50.458 --> 00:52.208
Cody. Can you mail this for me?

00:52.250 --> 00:54.667
It has to go out today and

00:52.250 --> 00:54.667
I kinda got my hands full here.

00:54.709 --> 00:57.959
Sure, sis.

00:54.709 --> 00:57.959
You spelled "welcome" wrong.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.709
( gasps )

00:58.000 --> 00:59.709
Kidding.

00:59.750 --> 01:00.959
( laughs )

01:01.000 --> 01:03.291
You better run.

01:06.291 --> 01:08.583
Whoa, nice kicks, Frankie.

01:08.625 --> 01:10.000
They're Dad's newest invention.

01:10.041 --> 01:12.291
Ski-Neakers. Waterski shoes.

01:12.333 --> 01:14.083
We're just going to test 'em.

01:12.333 --> 01:14.083
Wanna come?

01:14.125 --> 01:15.500
HEATWAVE:

01:14.125 --> 01:15.500
Absolutely.

01:15.542 --> 01:17.709
As exciting as

01:15.542 --> 01:17.709
party-planning is,

01:17.750 --> 01:21.667
it's times like this I'm glad

01:17.750 --> 01:21.667
I can turn into a boat.

01:21.709 --> 01:24.208
(  upbeat theme playing  )

01:33.750 --> 01:37.250
The science of my Ski-Neakers

01:33.750 --> 01:37.250
is simple.

01:37.291 --> 01:39.291
The soles take in

01:37.291 --> 01:39.291
surface water,

01:39.333 --> 01:42.542
then blast it out behind,

01:39.333 --> 01:42.542
creating propulsion.

01:42.583 --> 01:44.458
( grunts )

01:44.500 --> 01:47.000
You will, in essence,

01:44.500 --> 01:47.000
be sea-skating.

01:48.792 --> 01:51.834
FRANKIE:

01:48.792 --> 01:51.834
Whoo! Yeah! Whoo!

That,

03:12.458 --> 03:14.458
and saving our lives.

For which

03:14.500 --> 03:17.458
we are grateful.

03:17.500 --> 03:20.792
I'm afraid my lab

03:17.500 --> 03:20.792
wasn't as lucky.

03:22.125 --> 03:24.333
Where'd that wave

03:22.125 --> 03:24.333
come from, Doc?

03:24.375 --> 03:29.208
The possible causes of oceanic

03:24.375 --> 03:29.208
volatility are myriad.

03:29.250 --> 03:32.291
I'll be able to do more

03:29.250 --> 03:32.291
comprehensive research

03:32.333 --> 03:34.875
once I get my equipment

03:32.333 --> 03:34.875
repaired.

03:34.917 --> 03:38.417
Frankie. I may need to borrow

03:34.917 --> 03:38.417
your blow-dryer.

03:39.667 --> 03:43.583
B-Day is finally here.

03:43.625 --> 03:47.250
And things are

03:43.625 --> 03:47.250
Bumblebee-eautiful.

03:47.291 --> 03:50.125
So first I do a welcome speech,

03:47.291 --> 03:50.125
then the song,

03:50.166 --> 03:52.500
next the surprise.

03:52.542 --> 03:56.709
Remember Cody, don't pull

03:52.542 --> 03:56.709
the rope until I yell, "Now."

03:56.750 --> 03:58.917
"Now." Got it.

03:58.959 --> 04:01.875
Then we start on my list of

03:58.959 --> 04:01.875
things for Bee to see and do.

04:01.917 --> 04:03.625
B is Bumblebee.

04:03.667 --> 04:06.208
Remember, the more fun

04:03.667 --> 04:06.208
we make his visit,

04:06.250 --> 04:07.917
the longer he'll stay.

04:07.959 --> 04:09.875
Oh, boy.

04:09.917 --> 04:13.625
I have prepared some poetry

04:09.917 --> 04:13.625
in honor of Bumblebee's arrival.

04:13.667 --> 04:15.000

04:15.041 --> 04:19.333
Code 7, Code 7

04:15.041 --> 04:19.333
So unlike a Code 11

04:19.375 --> 04:25.208
Regulations for the populace

04:19.375 --> 04:25.208
Allow no calamity to topple us

04:25.250 --> 04:28.667
I would continue, but I require

04:25.250 --> 04:28.667
a rhyme for "protocol."

04:28.709 --> 04:30.417
This is my contribution.

04:30.458 --> 04:34.542
I call it

04:30.458 --> 04:34.542
"Bumblebee and Optimus."

04:34.583 --> 04:37.041
Well, I think I can

04:34.583 --> 04:37.041
fit you two in

04:37.083 --> 04:39.291
after hiking and scrapbooking.

04:39.333 --> 04:42.166
Ugh. Everyone

04:39.333 --> 04:42.166
needs to amp down.

04:42.208 --> 04:45.166
Bumblebee's only visiting

04:42.208 --> 04:45.166
because Optimus sent him.

04:45.208 --> 04:48.208
Warrior scouts

04:45.208 --> 04:48.208

What do you mean

05:03.250 --> 05:06.542
there's no time to visit?

05:06.583 --> 05:08.375
I planned our week.

Oh, you're here

on a mission?

05:13.166 --> 05:15.458
What are the chances?

05:16.500 --> 05:18.375
Greetings, Rescue Bots.

05:18.417 --> 05:21.083
My team has detected

05:18.417 --> 05:21.083
a newly-activated

05:21.125 --> 05:25.291
Cybertronian artifact

05:21.125 --> 05:25.291
on or near Griffin Rock.

05:25.333 --> 05:27.500
I am searching

05:25.333 --> 05:27.500
the surrounding ocean.

05:27.542 --> 05:30.625
Please assist Bumblebee

05:27.542 --> 05:30.625
in scouting the island.

05:30.667 --> 05:33.500
If you find the relic,

05:30.667 --> 05:33.500
alert me.

05:33.542 --> 05:37.750
Only the power of a Prime

05:33.542 --> 05:37.750
can turn off this technology.

05:37.792 --> 05:41.291
An assignment from Optimus

05:37.792 --> 05:41.291
himself is truly an honor.

05:41.333 --> 05:42.959
Happy to help,

05:41.333 --> 05:42.959
Bumblebee.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.291
Let's go tell Chief

05:43.000 --> 05:45.291
about our new mission.

05:45.333 --> 05:47.625
But we can't leave now.

Fossil-hunting for an ancient

alien artifact? Noble.

05:58.125 --> 06:01.291
Yeah, so what do we get

05:58.125 --> 06:01.291
if we win this scavenger hunt?

06:01.333 --> 06:03.166
It's not a game, Kade.

06:03.208 --> 06:06.917
Cybertronian technology is

06:03.208 --> 06:06.917
extremely fragile and dangerous.

06:06.959 --> 06:10.208
Ooh. Well, then you guys shoulda

06:06.959 --> 06:10.208
kept better track of it, huh?

Okay, then

06:18.542 --> 06:20.208
let's start searching.

06:20.250 --> 06:21.709
Not so fast, Dani.

06:21.750 --> 06:23.250
I just got a call

06:21.750 --> 06:23.250
from the mainland

06:23.291 --> 06:25.667
that your helicopter license

06:23.291 --> 06:25.667
expired.

06:25.709 --> 06:28.583
What? No way. I sent in

06:25.709 --> 06:28.583
my renewal three days ago.

06:28.625 --> 06:30.208
Cody mailed it for me.

06:30.250 --> 06:32.625
I was gonna,

06:30.250 --> 06:32.625
but then Frankie showed up

06:32.667 --> 06:34.208
and we tested Doc's prototype,

06:34.250 --> 06:35.667
and the wave hit us,

06:35.709 --> 06:38.291
and I forgot. Sorry.

06:38.333 --> 06:40.750
I'll do your chores for a week?

06:38.333 --> 06:40.750
( sighs )

06:40.792 --> 06:43.625
It's okay, Cody.

06:40.792 --> 06:43.625
It was my responsibility.

06:43.667 --> 06:46.208
But if you wanna

06:43.667 --> 06:46.208
clean my room...

06:46.250 --> 06:48.083
I'll send your paperwork in.

06:48.125 --> 06:51.041
Until it's processed, you aren't

06:48.125 --> 06:51.041
allowed to fly Blades.

06:51.083 --> 06:53.750
But Bumblebee needs our help.

06:53.792 --> 06:56.375
Besides, I'm the one who does

06:53.792 --> 06:56.375
all the flying,

06:56.417 --> 06:57.750
so can't she just--?

06:56.417 --> 06:57.750
No.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.959
If someone saw Dani

06:57.792 --> 06:59.959
at your controls,

07:00.000 --> 07:03.458
her license could be gone

07:00.000 --> 07:03.458
for good. Rules are rules.

07:03.500 --> 07:07.500
Specifically, Air Safety Rule

07:03.500 --> 07:07.500
46306, subsection 7.

07:07.542 --> 07:10.208
But Dani can still drive,

07:07.542 --> 07:10.208
right?

07:10.250 --> 07:12.875
Maybe she could ride

07:10.250 --> 07:12.875
with Bee.

07:12.917 --> 07:14.709
( beeps )

07:14.750 --> 07:17.834
Why would I mind sharing

07:14.750 --> 07:17.834
my partner with you?

07:17.875 --> 07:20.959
It'll be my two best friends

07:17.875 --> 07:20.959
riding together.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.500
I'm fine.

07:29.417 --> 07:31.041
( beeps )

07:31.083 --> 07:32.625
I don't know what you said,

07:32.667 --> 07:35.709
but you are one sweet ride,

07:32.667 --> 07:35.709
Bumblebee.

07:35.750 --> 07:38.000
Powerful, fast, and smooth.

07:38.041 --> 07:41.834
Oh, excuse me, Bumblebee,

07:38.041 --> 07:41.834
see that field ahead?

07:41.875 --> 07:44.709
Yeah, one time,

07:41.875 --> 07:44.709
Dani and I rescued a cow

07:44.750 --> 07:47.750
that got trapped

07:44.750 --> 07:47.750
in a barbed wire fence there.

07:47.792 --> 07:51.417
Oh, oh, and on the left

07:47.792 --> 07:51.417
is Courtney Bluff. Once--

07:51.458 --> 07:54.583
Blades, can we cut the chatter

07:51.458 --> 07:54.583
and focus on the mission?

07:54.625 --> 07:56.792
Ohh. Yeah.

07:56.834 --> 07:59.542
Let's take that fire road and

07:56.834 --> 07:59.542
search the deep forest, team.

07:59.583 --> 08:02.959
BLADES:

07:59.583 --> 08:02.959
Oh, yeah, don't worry about me.

07:59.583 --> 08:02.959
I'll-- I'll catch up.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.083
Eventually.

08:06.125 --> 08:09.417
It seems like we've covered

08:06.125 --> 08:09.417
every inch of this island.

08:09.458 --> 08:11.208
( beeps )

08:11.250 --> 08:14.542
Well, Optimus only said the

08:11.250 --> 08:14.542
relic might be on the island.

08:14.583 --> 08:18.458
Perhaps he has already located

08:14.583 --> 08:18.458
the artifact somewhere offshore.

08:18.500 --> 08:21.166
We should probably head home to

08:18.500 --> 08:21.166
the Firehouse and compare notes.

08:21.208 --> 08:24.000
BLADES:

08:21.208 --> 08:24.000
Hey, finally.

08:24.041 --> 08:25.625
Oh, oh, Bumblebee,

08:24.041 --> 08:25.625
once we're back,

08:25.667 --> 08:28.250
we can watch

08:25.667 --> 08:28.250
my favorite movie.

08:28.291 --> 08:31.542
It's about these two friends

08:28.291 --> 08:31.542
who travel around together

08:31.583 --> 08:33.291
and have wacky adventures.

08:33.333 --> 08:34.625
CODY:

08:33.333 --> 08:34.625
Hey, guys?

08:34.667 --> 08:36.625
I just got a call

08:34.667 --> 08:36.625
from Captain Shaw.

08:36.667 --> 08:39.000
A right whale is swimming

08:36.667 --> 08:39.000
close to the ferry.

08:39.041 --> 08:41.959
Really close.

08:42.041 --> 08:44.000
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

08:46.417 --> 08:48.291
( people screaming )

08:48.333 --> 08:50.625
( alarm blaring )

08:52.667 --> 08:54.709
( people yelling )

08:54.750 --> 08:56.458
CODY:

08:54.750 --> 08:56.458
Dad, the whale

08:54.750 --> 08:56.458
sunk the ferry.

08:56.500 --> 08:58.083
People are overboard.

08:58.125 --> 08:59.667
We'll take care of it, Cody.

08:59.709 --> 09:02.083
Hold up, team.

09:03.333 --> 09:05.291
This is an air and sea rescue.

09:05.333 --> 09:06.792
Heatwave, head for the ocean.

09:06.834 --> 09:11.208
Blades and I'll meet you there.

09:11.250 --> 09:14.250
But what are Bumblebee

09:11.250 --> 09:14.250
and Dani gonna do?

09:14.291 --> 09:16.291
They'll wait back at home

09:14.291 --> 09:16.291
with Boulder and Chase.

09:16.333 --> 09:18.625
Land-based vehicles

09:16.333 --> 09:18.625
aren't much help on the water.

09:18.667 --> 09:21.458
So much for showing off

09:18.667 --> 09:21.458
my new rescue moves.

09:21.500 --> 09:23.709
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

09:23.750 --> 09:25.667
DANI:

09:23.750 --> 09:25.667
So, Bumblebee,

09:25.709 --> 09:27.917
how about I give you a tour

09:25.709 --> 09:27.917
of the Firehouse's upgrades

09:27.959 --> 09:30.083
since your last visit?

09:27.959 --> 09:30.083
( beeps )

09:30.125 --> 09:32.959
Aww.

09:30.125 --> 09:32.959
But I wanted to do that.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.333
Blades? Stop eavesdropping

09:33.000 --> 09:35.333
on the com channel.

09:35.375 --> 09:37.709
I didn't know whales

09:35.375 --> 09:37.709
swam so close to shore.

09:37.750 --> 09:40.458
They don't, usually.

09:37.750 --> 09:40.458
That's what's weird.

09:40.500 --> 09:43.417
Cody, can you see if Doc's

09:40.500 --> 09:43.417
ocean lab picked up any data

09:43.458 --> 09:45.041
on the whale's

09:43.458 --> 09:45.041
swimming patterns?

09:45.083 --> 09:47.125
Sure thing, Graham.

09:56.250 --> 09:58.625
( whale moans )

09:58.667 --> 10:00.083
All right, nice and easy,

09:58.667 --> 10:00.083
everyone.

10:00.125 --> 10:02.417
No shoving, the whale's

10:00.125 --> 10:02.417
not a man-eater.

10:02.458 --> 10:04.917
I think.

10:09.667 --> 10:13.333
Down a little. Left, and...

10:13.375 --> 10:15.291
Bingo.

10:15.333 --> 10:19.166
Done. Now we can get back

10:15.333 --> 10:19.166
to hanging out with Bumblebee.

10:19.208 --> 10:22.875
First we need to tow this ferry

10:19.208 --> 10:22.875
into dry dock for repairs.

10:22.917 --> 10:25.542
Will that take a long time?

10:25.583 --> 10:27.667
Depends how fast we get started.

10:30.709 --> 10:32.834
DOC:

10:30.709 --> 10:32.834
First the rogue wave,

10:32.875 --> 10:36.041
now the right whale

10:32.875 --> 10:36.041
going the wrong way.

10:36.083 --> 10:38.875
My instincts tell me

10:36.083 --> 10:38.875
there must be a connection,

10:38.917 --> 10:42.000
but my instruments show what

10:38.917 --> 10:42.000
is referred to among scientists

10:42.041 --> 10:44.542
as bupkis.

10:44.583 --> 10:47.959
Cody. Have any other

10:44.583 --> 10:47.959
emergency calls come in

10:48.000 --> 10:51.542
about weird ocean stuff?

10:48.000 --> 10:51.542
Funky algae blooms?

10:51.583 --> 10:53.125
Crazy rip tides?

10:53.166 --> 10:56.583
Nope. Well, last week my dad

10:53.166 --> 10:56.583
said that Madeline Pynch

10:56.625 --> 10:58.750
asked for a permit to do

10:56.625 --> 10:58.750
some underwater drilling,

10:58.792 --> 11:01.000
but the mayor gave her

10:58.792 --> 11:01.000
a big thumbs down.

11:01.041 --> 11:02.709
DOC:

11:01.041 --> 11:02.709
And well he should.

11:02.750 --> 11:05.458
It's far too dangerous

11:02.750 --> 11:05.458
to use mining equipment

11:05.500 --> 11:07.166
so near our island.

11:07.208 --> 11:10.417
Since when has the Pynch family

11:07.208 --> 11:10.417
ever taken "no" for an answer?

11:10.458 --> 11:13.959
We'll let your father know

11:10.458 --> 11:13.959
if we discover anything, Cody.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.542
Come, my little prawn,

11:15.583 --> 11:19.375
we're off to the sea lab

11:15.583 --> 11:19.375
to fish for answers.

11:19.417 --> 11:21.917
(  mellow theme playing  )

11:23.875 --> 11:25.291
( tires screech )

11:27.709 --> 11:31.125
That was definitely not

11:27.709 --> 11:31.125
on our schedule of activities.

11:31.166 --> 11:33.333
(  action theme playing  )

11:40.583 --> 11:43.125
Whoo-hoo. Yeah.

11:43.166 --> 11:47.166
Way to go, Dani. You set a new

11:43.166 --> 11:47.166
training course speed record.

11:47.208 --> 11:49.709
(  majestic theme playing  )

11:51.041 --> 11:53.000
Nice job, partner.

11:53.041 --> 11:54.500
Partner? But--

11:54.542 --> 11:56.583
Enjoy it while you can,

11:54.542 --> 11:56.583
sis.

11:56.625 --> 12:01.208
Me and Heatwave

11:56.625 --> 12:01.208
are about to crush your time.

12:01.250 --> 12:04.250
How about you, Chase? You want

12:01.250 --> 12:04.250
to take a crack at that record?

12:04.291 --> 12:06.333
As we determined

12:04.291 --> 12:06.333
the Cybertronian artifact

12:06.375 --> 12:07.667
is not on the island,

12:07.709 --> 12:10.625
I believe I have a new mission.

12:12.834 --> 12:15.333
(  action theme playing  )

12:15.375 --> 12:16.834
( tires screeching )

12:16.875 --> 12:21.125
Lots of luck beating

12:16.875 --> 12:21.125
Bee and Dee, the dynamic duo.

12:21.166 --> 12:23.583
BLADES:

12:21.166 --> 12:23.583
What? But...

12:23.625 --> 12:27.458
I'm your original "B."

12:23.625 --> 12:27.458
That rhymes with "me,"

12:27.500 --> 12:29.250
and it stands for Blades.

12:29.291 --> 12:30.625
( beeps )

12:30.667 --> 12:32.125
You're not upset,

12:30.667 --> 12:32.125
are you, Blades?

12:32.166 --> 12:33.875
This is a driving course.

12:33.917 --> 12:35.834
I-I didn't think you'd mind

12:33.917 --> 12:35.834
if I teamed up with Bee.

12:35.875 --> 12:39.375
Mind? Why would I mind?

12:35.875 --> 12:39.375
I don't mind.

12:39.417 --> 12:42.667
Oh, hey, I have an idea.

12:39.417 --> 12:42.667
You can be our pit crew.

12:42.709 --> 12:44.333
What does that mean?

12:44.375 --> 12:46.417
You sit on the sidelines

12:44.375 --> 12:46.417
and you just--

12:46.458 --> 12:49.583
No, no, no. I think I've had

12:46.458 --> 12:49.583
enough of that for one day,

12:49.625 --> 12:52.250
thank you.

12:49.625 --> 12:52.250
Now if you'll excuse me,

12:52.291 --> 12:55.375
I have a buddy movie to watch.

12:55.417 --> 12:57.583
(  mellow theme playing  )

12:57.625 --> 13:01.000
Bee and Dani are supposed to be

12:57.625 --> 13:01.000
my best friends.

13:01.041 --> 13:03.667
Not each other's.

13:01.041 --> 13:03.667
Now they don't even need me--

13:03.709 --> 13:05.208
OPTIMUS:

13:03.709 --> 13:05.208
But I do.

13:05.250 --> 13:07.875
(  dramatic theme playing  )

13:07.917 --> 13:09.792
Aah!

13:09.834 --> 13:12.875
Optimus Prime. Sir.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.500
How much of that

13:12.917 --> 13:14.500
did you hear?

13:14.542 --> 13:18.834
Enough. Where are Bumblebee

13:14.542 --> 13:18.834
and your fellow Rescue Bots?

13:18.875 --> 13:21.375
At the training course.

13:18.875 --> 13:21.375
Um, I can show you how to get--

13:21.417 --> 13:25.667
That is not necessary.

13:21.417 --> 13:25.667
You are the only Bot I require.

13:25.709 --> 13:28.625
You want to hang out with me?

13:28.667 --> 13:31.542
The fate of this island

13:28.667 --> 13:31.542
depends upon it.

13:31.583 --> 13:36.000
I won't let you down, sir.

13:36.041 --> 13:38.542
( platform whirring

13:36.041 --> 13:38.542
and beeping )

13:41.709 --> 13:43.667
Whoa, Optimus.

13:43.709 --> 13:46.583
I didn't know you were here.

13:43.709 --> 13:46.583
Should I get my dad?

13:46.625 --> 13:48.709
That will not be necessary,

13:46.625 --> 13:48.709
Cody.

13:48.750 --> 13:51.667
Blades can provide

13:48.750 --> 13:51.667
the assistance I need.

13:51.709 --> 13:55.875
Please inform Chief

13:51.709 --> 13:55.875
that we are on a mission.

13:55.917 --> 13:59.500
He said "we."

13:55.917 --> 13:59.500
Me and Optimus.

13:59.542 --> 14:02.000
We're a "we."

14:02.041 --> 14:05.417
Ready for our mission, sir.

14:07.417 --> 14:09.917
(  upbeat theme playing  )

14:16.125 --> 14:18.417
Sir, I must admit, legally

14:16.125 --> 14:18.417
permitted unfettered speed

14:18.458 --> 14:19.917
is rather enjoyable.

14:19.959 --> 14:21.417
Give it all you got, Chase.

14:21.458 --> 14:23.417
We can catch Bumblebee

14:21.458 --> 14:23.417
on this straightaway.

14:26.792 --> 14:29.625
(  dramatic theme playing  )

14:29.667 --> 14:31.792
( screams )

14:31.834 --> 14:34.583
Hey!

14:39.166 --> 14:41.208
( beeps )

14:41.250 --> 14:44.500
I believe this is what humans

14:41.250 --> 14:44.500
call, "hanging in there."

14:44.542 --> 14:47.125
Grab on. I'll pull you out.

14:47.166 --> 14:49.458
I apologize, chief.

14:49.500 --> 14:52.458
Boulder assured me our racetrack

14:49.500 --> 14:52.458
was built "to code."

14:52.500 --> 14:54.417
We'll investigate that later.

14:54.458 --> 14:56.208
Assuming there is a later.

14:56.250 --> 14:58.250
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

15:01.917 --> 15:05.125
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

15:05.166 --> 15:07.917
( grunting )

15:07.959 --> 15:10.125
( both grunt )

15:12.417 --> 15:15.667
Guess fishing does have

15:12.417 --> 15:15.667
a practical use.

15:15.709 --> 15:18.458
Please do not throw us back.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.291
( beeps )

15:20.333 --> 15:24.166
We're not sure. Graham? Any idea

15:20.333 --> 15:24.166
what caused the sinkhole?

15:24.208 --> 15:26.875
Yes, but it doesn't make

15:24.208 --> 15:26.875
much sense.

15:26.917 --> 15:28.500
The ground's soggy.

15:28.542 --> 15:31.291
Super-saturated

15:28.542 --> 15:31.291
with seawater.

15:31.333 --> 15:33.667
Not what you want to hear

15:31.333 --> 15:33.667
when you live on an island.

15:33.709 --> 15:37.000
We'd better call Doc.

15:37.041 --> 15:40.625
Um, Optimus.

15:37.041 --> 15:40.625
What is our mission, exactly?

15:40.667 --> 15:43.667
Retrieval of the Cybertronian

15:40.667 --> 15:43.667
artifact.

15:43.709 --> 15:47.875
Some form of Earth technology

15:43.709 --> 15:47.875
has activated the relic.

15:47.917 --> 15:50.625
The relic turns everything

15:47.917 --> 15:50.625
in its path to liquid.

15:50.667 --> 15:53.375
Rock, organic matter, metal.

15:53.417 --> 15:55.041
If we do not shut it down soon,

15:55.083 --> 15:57.792
this entire island

15:55.083 --> 15:57.792
will become water.

15:57.834 --> 16:00.166
But then everyone on it would--

16:00.208 --> 16:04.625
Yes. That is why I need you

16:00.208 --> 16:04.625
to fly to the relic quickly

16:04.667 --> 16:06.959
and help me retrieve it

16:04.667 --> 16:06.959
from the ocean.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.208
Wait until I tell Dani and Bee.

16:09.250 --> 16:11.375
So where to, sir?

16:11.417 --> 16:14.250
I am not entirely certain.

16:11.417 --> 16:14.250
The water's depth

16:14.291 --> 16:16.417
is interfering

16:14.291 --> 16:16.417
with my detection device.

16:16.458 --> 16:18.250
CODY:

16:16.458 --> 16:18.250
Sorry to interrupt,

16:18.291 --> 16:22.959
but I think I know someone in

16:18.291 --> 16:22.959
the neighborhood who can help.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.333
CODY:

16:23.000 --> 16:25.333
So we're looking

16:23.000 --> 16:25.333
for a liquidator.

16:25.375 --> 16:27.875
Ha. I think you mean

16:25.375 --> 16:27.875
"liquefier."

16:27.917 --> 16:29.834
That would explain

16:27.917 --> 16:29.834
the message

16:29.875 --> 16:31.875
we got from Chief

16:29.875 --> 16:31.875
about a sinkhole.

16:31.917 --> 16:35.417
Triangulating the firehouse

16:31.917 --> 16:35.417
chasm with the rogue wave

16:35.458 --> 16:36.834
and the lost whale...

16:36.875 --> 16:39.333
I may be able

16:36.875 --> 16:39.333
to pinpoint the artifact.

16:39.375 --> 16:41.542
Cody, please inform Optimus

16:41.583 --> 16:44.375
I will forward the data

16:41.583 --> 16:44.375
as soon as possible.

16:44.417 --> 16:48.542
CODY:

16:44.417 --> 16:48.542
Sooner than possible

16:44.417 --> 16:48.542
would be better, Doc.

16:48.583 --> 16:50.667
Dad? Griffin Rock's

16:48.583 --> 16:50.667
in deep trouble,

16:50.709 --> 16:52.333
and it's getting deeper.

16:52.375 --> 16:55.542
Geysers, flooding,

16:52.375 --> 16:55.542
and sinkholes, right?

16:55.583 --> 16:57.083
The mayor just called.

16:57.125 --> 16:59.792
Forward us the 411

16:57.125 --> 16:59.792
on the 911s, Cody.

16:59.834 --> 17:02.709
We'll split up and take

16:59.834 --> 17:02.709
each emergency as it arises.

17:02.750 --> 17:05.250
(  dramatic theme playing  )

17:08.125 --> 17:09.542
Rescue Bots--

17:09.583 --> 17:10.834
( beeps )

17:10.875 --> 17:13.583
Heh. And honorary Rescue Bots.

17:13.625 --> 17:16.000
Roll to the rescue.

17:18.208 --> 17:21.083
Blades, the signal's source

17:18.208 --> 17:21.083
should be

17:21.125 --> 17:24.125
three degrees southeast

17:21.125 --> 17:24.125
of your current location.

17:24.166 --> 17:27.125
BLADES:

17:24.166 --> 17:27.125
Thanks, Doc. We're on our way.

17:27.166 --> 17:28.834
I am grateful

17:27.166 --> 17:28.834
that you were willing

17:28.875 --> 17:32.417
to temporarily leave your team

17:28.875 --> 17:32.417
to assist me.

17:32.458 --> 17:34.500
Optimus, helping you is--

17:34.542 --> 17:37.291
I mean,

17:34.542 --> 17:37.291
you're bigger than Elvis.

17:37.333 --> 17:40.000
I have not met this "Elvis"

17:40.041 --> 17:42.417
and am unaware of his size,

17:42.458 --> 17:45.250
but have you no concern

17:42.458 --> 17:45.250
that your partner will feel

17:45.291 --> 17:46.667
left out of this mission?

17:46.709 --> 17:49.166
No. Dani can't fly

17:46.709 --> 17:49.166
right now.

17:49.208 --> 17:51.208
But she wouldn't mind anyway,

17:51.250 --> 17:53.834
because what we're doing

17:51.250 --> 17:53.834
is for everyone.

17:53.875 --> 17:57.500
Indeed. For a team to reach

17:53.875 --> 17:57.500
its full potential,

17:57.542 --> 18:00.834
there is no room

17:57.542 --> 18:00.834
for jealousy among peers.

18:00.875 --> 18:04.417
Okay, this isn't about Dani

18:00.875 --> 18:04.417
anymore, is it?

18:04.458 --> 18:07.125
I believe we have reached

18:04.458 --> 18:07.125
our destination.

18:07.166 --> 18:11.375
This mechanism likely activated

18:07.166 --> 18:11.375
the Cybertronian relic.

18:12.625 --> 18:15.000
Lower me.

18:21.083 --> 18:23.125
BLADES:

18:21.083 --> 18:23.125
Cody, are you seeing this?

18:23.166 --> 18:25.417
That's Madeline Pynch's

18:23.166 --> 18:25.417
drilling platform.

18:25.458 --> 18:27.834
But the mayor told her

18:25.458 --> 18:27.834
she couldn't use it.

18:27.875 --> 18:30.750
BLADES:

18:27.875 --> 18:30.750
Oh. Someone's

18:27.875 --> 18:30.750
gonna be in trouble.

18:30.792 --> 18:32.875
Yeah, the whole island.

18:32.917 --> 18:35.417
(  dramatic theme playing  )

18:37.542 --> 18:42.000
Please be advised that all lanes

18:37.542 --> 18:42.000
are temporarily carpools.

18:43.375 --> 18:45.875
( rumbling )

18:50.542 --> 18:52.750
( grunts )

18:59.917 --> 19:01.583
Problem solved.

19:01.625 --> 19:03.542
Not even close.

19:03.583 --> 19:06.333
Guys? Terra firma is getting

19:03.583 --> 19:06.333
less firm by the minute.

19:06.375 --> 19:08.959
Tell me about it.

19:11.417 --> 19:14.083
Drive to high-and-dry ground.

19:11.417 --> 19:14.083
You'll be okay.

19:17.041 --> 19:19.834
( screams )

19:19.875 --> 19:21.667
Oh, yuck.

19:21.709 --> 19:23.583
( groaning )

19:23.625 --> 19:24.834
Hey!

19:24.875 --> 19:27.333
( screams )

19:27.375 --> 19:28.625
( beeps )

19:28.667 --> 19:32.041
No, stay back.

19:32.083 --> 19:34.250
This is quicksand.

19:34.291 --> 19:36.792
(  dramatic theme playing  )

20:01.667 --> 20:05.375
Chief, with the liquefying

20:01.667 --> 20:05.375
artifact no longer operational,

20:05.417 --> 20:09.333
your island should regain

20:05.417 --> 20:09.333
its former solidity by tomorrow.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.083
That's too long to wait, guys.

20:11.125 --> 20:13.834
They call it quicksand

20:11.125 --> 20:13.834
for a reason.

20:13.875 --> 20:15.792
( beeps )

20:15.834 --> 20:18.208
Try to stay still, Dani.

20:15.834 --> 20:18.208
We're on our way.

20:18.250 --> 20:19.917
( siren wailing )

20:19.959 --> 20:23.000
Blades?

20:19.959 --> 20:23.000
I'm flying as fast as I can.

20:23.041 --> 20:25.208
I am slowing you down.

20:27.166 --> 20:28.667
Good luck.

20:28.709 --> 20:31.875
Thank you, Optimus.

20:28.709 --> 20:31.875
Ooh, I wish Bumblebee knew

20:31.917 --> 20:33.667
how to do an air rescue.

20:33.709 --> 20:35.792

Dani.

21:01.875 --> 21:03.583
Way to go, Bee.

21:03.625 --> 21:05.583
You guys

21:03.625 --> 21:05.583
make great partners.

21:07.750 --> 21:10.542
Thanks for being there for Dani

21:07.750 --> 21:10.542
when I couldn't, Bumblebee.

21:10.583 --> 21:13.083
( beeps )

21:13.125 --> 21:16.000
Oh. From your reaction, I'm

21:13.125 --> 21:16.000
guessing he didn't actually say

21:16.041 --> 21:17.667
"beep bloop beep," huh?

21:17.709 --> 21:21.125
He said, "That's what it means

21:17.709 --> 21:21.125
to be on a team.

21:21.166 --> 21:22.750
We're all partners."

21:22.792 --> 21:25.041
When did you learn Bumblebee?

21:25.083 --> 21:29.125
I didn't.

21:25.083 --> 21:29.125
I just know it's the truth.
