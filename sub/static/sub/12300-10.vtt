WEBVTT

00:46.954 --> 00:48.372
Sixteen years on the job ...

00:48.372 --> 00:50.583
... and this is the most bizarre
thing I've ever seen.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.127
It's a new one for me, too.

00:55.004 --> 00:57.673
Cross-country runner found him
when she was training.

00:58.716 --> 01:01.177
Thinks he might be a
professor at the university.

01:01.677 --> 01:03.012
So, no ID yet?

01:03.763 --> 01:05.013
No, we're working on it.

01:11.938 --> 01:13.397
Auto-erotic?

01:13.397 --> 01:16.484
I don't think so.
Too much violence.

01:17.109 --> 01:18.444
No way is it suicide.

01:18.945 --> 01:20.822
It's not a suicide.
You see the knots?

01:20.822 --> 01:22.907
See how elaborate this is?

01:23.157 --> 01:24.325
Where does this leave us now?

01:27.954 --> 01:29.205
Up a tree.

02:24.800 --> 02:27.428
Rust has spread to the tree.

02:27.428 --> 02:29.513
This block and fall's
been here a while.

02:29.764 --> 02:31.766
A pulley system.

02:32.183 --> 02:33.851
Now what is that doing here?

02:33.851 --> 02:35.728
Looks like trauma
from head to toe.

02:35.728 --> 02:38.564
You think it was inflicted before
or after he was strung up?

02:38.648 --> 02:39.732
Don't know...

02:40.691 --> 02:41.734
yet.

02:42.985 --> 02:44.153
Fabric and blood.

02:47.907 --> 02:50.785
There's an awful lot of foot traffic
for such an out-of-the-way place.

02:50.993 --> 02:54.914
The campus isn't far. Maybe the kids
come here to party, make out.

02:55.748 --> 02:57.041
You got something, Speed?

02:57.124 --> 02:58.501
Yeah, take a look at this.

02:59.752 --> 03:00.920
Is that canine?

03:01.963 --> 03:05.383
Some kind of animal sacrifice?
Weird cult?

03:06.425 --> 03:09.554
It's in the same shape as our victim
mutilated and dead.

03:12.515 --> 03:13.599
I got an ID.

03:13.683 --> 03:17.645
Adam Metzger, cultural anthropologist.
Teaches at the university.

03:17.645 --> 03:20.773
Well, he just took a permanent
sabbatical, didn't he?

03:25.570 --> 03:28.531
Eyes open.
Implies he died quickly.

03:29.866 --> 03:31.492
But his wounds don't
make sense.

03:34.203 --> 03:36.038
I've got signs of retinal burn.

03:36.247 --> 03:37.206
You mean like
snow blindness?

03:37.623 --> 03:38.708
Yeah.

03:41.419 --> 03:43.462
How could he get snow
blindness in Miami?

03:45.464 --> 03:46.924
His eyelids are glued open.

03:51.387 --> 03:53.681
Somebody wanted to make
sure he saw something.

03:53.764 --> 03:56.058
Or, based on the
damage to his retina ...

03:56.058 --> 03:57.226
... saw nothing.

03:58.686 --> 04:01.314
All right ...
one wound down.

04:01.647 --> 04:02.690
Want to get started?

04:02.690 --> 04:03.941
Yeah.

04:04.984 --> 04:10.197
Puncture wounds, six inches deep.
Size and shape of an ice pick; nine total.

04:10.823 --> 04:15.745
Twelve-inch contusions indicating
blunt force: eight such wounds.

04:18.956 --> 04:21.666
One- to two-inch cuts.
Could be a razor blade...

04:21.666 --> 04:22.793
fourteen of those.

04:31.510 --> 04:32.762
Are those needle marks?

04:32.970 --> 04:36.599
Puncture wounds.
You said you were thinking cult?

04:36.599 --> 04:39.393
Maybe. Maybe like a
life-size voodoo doll.

04:40.353 --> 04:44.649
Counting those as one, we have a total
of sixty-two wounds, all antemortem.

04:44.649 --> 04:48.319
All that blood, and yet he didn't
die of exsanguination, did he?

04:48.319 --> 04:52.532
No. No, whoever killed him managed
to avoid every major blood vessel.

04:52.532 --> 04:55.076
Sixty-two wounds, and not
one of them meant to kill him.

04:55.076 --> 04:57.203
Cause of death
was asphyxiation.

04:57.203 --> 05:00.164
So, he was mutilated
for who knows how long.

05:01.207 --> 05:03.709
This looks to be one
of the oldest wounds.

05:07.171 --> 05:11.801
Antemortem abrasions have
four stages of healing:

05:11.801 --> 05:15.346
Scab formation,
epithelial regeneration,

05:15.346 --> 05:19.308
hyperplasia, and regression
of granulation tissues.

05:20.601 --> 05:23.437
These scrapes were at
the second stage.

05:23.437 --> 05:27.733
So, his body went through four
to six hours of healing.

05:28.359 --> 05:30.444
Or four to six hours of torture.

06:05.313 --> 06:07.148
Hey.
Hey.

06:07.148 --> 06:08.608
How you doing?

06:08.608 --> 06:11.027
Underwater recovery
called with a stinker.

06:11.360 --> 06:14.447
Classic insurance job
with a twist, I'm sure.

06:14.864 --> 06:18.201
Bring you back to the days when you
were drinking murky canal water...

06:18.201 --> 06:20.119
and dining on rusty car parts?

06:20.119 --> 06:23.247
Yeah, don't knock it. Underwater
recovery gets all the chicks.

06:35.551 --> 06:37.053
No skid marks.

06:37.345 --> 06:39.430
Which means it wasn't
an accident.

06:41.933 --> 06:44.310
Which means somebody
probably pushed it in.

06:50.441 --> 06:51.692
Eric Delko.

06:53.569 --> 06:55.029
The man who went on
to bigger and better things.

06:55.029 --> 06:56.405
Hey, how are you, man?

06:56.405 --> 06:57.698
I'm still wet, man.

06:57.698 --> 07:00.576
Yeah, you are.
Somebody called in a shadow?

07:00.910 --> 07:02.620
Yeah.
This was what we got.

07:02.620 --> 07:06.207
Windows wide open.
It looks, uh, it looks hinky.

07:06.499 --> 07:07.875
Well, she sunk fast.

07:21.514 --> 07:23.182
Silt layer's pretty thin.

07:23.182 --> 07:26.102
Hasn't been here long.
Three, maybe four weeks.

07:26.602 --> 07:28.396
Aren't you supposed to be on
the other side of the law now?

07:28.604 --> 07:32.358
Why don't you get on the other side
of this car and help me out with this?

07:41.909 --> 07:45.329
Yeah, no problem. Look, I'm ...
going to go secure the tow.

07:50.626 --> 07:54.505
Bacteria's filled his body
with rancid gas.

07:54.505 --> 07:56.507
Ah, guy's twice his
normal size.

07:56.507 --> 07:58.801
Yeah, it's a trunk job.
It could be a mob hit.

07:58.801 --> 08:01.429
Yeah, or drug related. We'll know
more once we get him out.

08:01.429 --> 08:05.433
Yeah, could you see if there's any
more surprises in that trunk?

08:05.433 --> 08:08.352
Yeah, we got to be really
careful with these guys.

08:08.352 --> 08:10.646
It's really easy for them to burst.

08:11.022 --> 08:12.648
Oh, whoa, Jerry, whoa!

08:12.648 --> 08:14.025
Oh, relax!

08:20.281 --> 08:22.366
Okay, I think I might have it.

08:23.784 --> 08:24.952
Handcuff knot.

08:26.954 --> 08:28.247
Military.

08:28.247 --> 08:31.918
Used to tie prisoners.
And professors.

08:36.172 --> 08:38.341
A hundred and ninety-one
countries in the world,

08:38.341 --> 08:41.469
seven-eighths of which
have armed forces.

08:41.552 --> 08:44.054
Well, at least that narrows it.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.560
Speed, what have you got?

08:50.269 --> 08:52.855
DNA results from the
fabric at the tree.

08:52.855 --> 08:54.482
The blood doesn't
match the professor's.

08:54.482 --> 08:55.691
I don't know,
maybe it's our killer.

08:55.691 --> 08:58.569
Or killers. We've got thirteen
different types of wounds here.

08:58.986 --> 09:00.905
That means thirteen
different weapons.

09:00.905 --> 09:04.075
Not yet identified.
Take a look at these.

09:05.868 --> 09:07.286
What is that, a tattoo?

09:09.372 --> 09:11.457
It's a contact burn;
look closer.

09:15.461 --> 09:16.712
Streaming nuclei.

09:16.712 --> 09:19.799
Those are micro-blisters normally
associated with an electrical burn.

09:19.799 --> 09:23.135
Now, I thought taser,
but the marks are too large.

09:23.678 --> 09:25.012
Maybe an electric baton?

09:25.012 --> 09:26.013
Possibly.

09:26.305 --> 09:28.015
What part of the body
are we looking at?

09:28.015 --> 09:29.225
Scrotal sack.

09:31.102 --> 09:33.646
Thirteen weapons, thirteen wounds...

09:33.646 --> 09:35.106
thirteen different killers?

09:35.106 --> 09:37.525
It's the appropriate number
for a cult, right?

09:38.568 --> 09:41.153
People's feelings for the professor
ran pretty much hot or cold.

09:41.153 --> 09:42.530
No in-betweens with that guy.

09:42.530 --> 09:43.906
Start with his students.

09:43.906 --> 09:46.701
Loved him, thought he was a genius.
Wish I could agree.

09:46.701 --> 09:48.661
Okay, so that's where
the cold came in.

09:49.078 --> 09:50.788
Look, I'm sorry to hear
that Adam was murdered,

09:50.788 --> 09:52.331
but in a way, I'm not surprised.

09:52.331 --> 09:53.124
Why is that?

09:53.124 --> 09:54.500
The guy was a whack job.

09:54.917 --> 09:58.254
Hatred is inherent.

09:59.547 --> 10:01.215
It is instinctual.

10:01.465 --> 10:02.717
For every student that loved him,

10:02.717 --> 10:05.303
there were two parents and another
professor who couldn't stand him.

10:05.386 --> 10:07.138
He was as controversial
as they come.

10:07.388 --> 10:10.808
Man is not man without hate.

10:11.517 --> 10:13.769
Tell me more about his
extreme teaching methods.

10:13.769 --> 10:15.021
Sure, let's see.

10:15.021 --> 10:17.148
He came to class one
day dressed as Hitler.

10:17.148 --> 10:19.108
Wrote serial numbers
on everyone's forearm.

10:19.108 --> 10:22.528
A couple of weeks ago he brought in
a grand dragon of the KKK...

10:22.528 --> 10:25.031
and a Colombian prison interrogator
to give guest lectures.

10:26.073 --> 10:31.287
Pain moves us into the process of
becoming whole...

10:33.122 --> 10:34.457
healthy.

10:34.457 --> 10:36.334
The other day I walked
in he was showing some...

10:36.334 --> 10:40.504
home movies. Slaughter, torture,
lynchings, you name it.

10:41.297 --> 10:46.052
Pain is necessary.
Pain is vital ...

10:46.052 --> 10:47.220
for survival.

10:48.262 --> 10:50.181
We're going to need
to talk to his class.

10:50.598 --> 10:51.724
On the way there now.

10:52.767 --> 10:54.143
One more question, Dean.

10:55.728 --> 10:57.396
How many students
did the professor have?

10:58.064 --> 10:59.774
Thirteen.
Why?

11:00.816 --> 11:01.567
Thirteen.

11:07.323 --> 11:11.202
I have a very interesting
lesson plan for today, class.

11:12.286 --> 11:16.249
It's called:
"How to take a DNA swab."

11:21.629 --> 11:22.964
So who's going to be first?

11:36.167 --> 11:37.627
Ned Sante,

11:37.627 --> 11:42.840
you're here because we matched your DNA swab
to a piece of bloody fabric at the crime scene,

11:43.174 --> 11:47.053
and that three of your fellow students
claimed you threatened to kill the professor.

11:47.303 --> 11:49.013
I didn't want him dead, okay?

11:49.013 --> 11:50.390
You just wanted to torture him.

11:50.390 --> 11:51.641
It's not like that at all.

11:53.476 --> 11:54.727
He was going to kill me.

11:56.521 --> 11:57.563
I mean, not really.

11:58.314 --> 11:59.440
I'm so freaking confused!

12:00.608 --> 12:01.651
One minute, I ...

12:02.193 --> 12:03.987
hated him so much.

12:05.238 --> 12:08.366
Now I see it was just all
part of his lesson.

12:08.366 --> 12:11.077
Part of his lesson?
You mean hanging 101?.

12:12.120 --> 12:13.579
It was a mock lynching.

12:21.129 --> 12:25.091
Metzger was making some point about
normal people following social norms.

12:25.300 --> 12:27.093
You mean like the
Stanford Experiments?

12:27.510 --> 12:29.470
My friends turned on me in,
like, two seconds.

12:30.513 --> 12:31.556
Strip him.

12:41.357 --> 12:42.609
That sounds degrading.

12:45.028 --> 12:46.487
Did he treat other students badly?

12:47.864 --> 12:49.907
His research papers won awards.

12:52.327 --> 12:55.371
Ned, don't you think...

12:55.371 --> 12:58.166
that a human being should have
greater value than a research paper?

13:07.342 --> 13:08.593
This is not good.

13:12.847 --> 13:13.890
Hello?

13:15.558 --> 13:16.643
Excuse me.

13:18.019 --> 13:19.395
Excuse me, but what
are you doing here?

13:21.356 --> 13:23.650
Miss, miss ...
you in the sweater.

13:27.070 --> 13:28.488
What are you guys doing here?

13:28.988 --> 13:32.408
He had an open-door policy.
Plus, we all had keys.

13:32.825 --> 13:34.494
Why didn't you mention this before?

13:34.702 --> 13:37.830
Our relationship with our professor
is none of your business.

13:38.373 --> 13:41.584
Okay. You want to tell me more
about this open-door policy?

13:44.837 --> 13:47.006
Sometimes he needed
help typing up a paper.

13:47.006 --> 13:49.592
Sometimes we would take his
laundry to the cleaners.

13:49.592 --> 13:51.678
We were all really close.

14:01.479 --> 14:02.730
Listen to this:

14:04.399 --> 14:06.192
"No man chooses evil because it is evil.

14:06.192 --> 14:11.447
He only mistakes it
for happiness." Wollstonecraft.

14:12.407 --> 14:16.744
Why anyone needs to prove
that evil exists is beyond me.

14:16.953 --> 14:20.248
Took us six hundred years
to classify slavery as evil.

14:21.916 --> 14:24.627
Got a lot of paper here
shredded for a pack rat.

14:26.713 --> 14:28.798
Maybe he's got an
awful lot of secrets.

14:32.093 --> 14:33.761
You got the bolt cutters
in the truck?

14:42.729 --> 14:46.899
Nice.
Very nice.

14:50.194 --> 14:53.031
Jade ... Honey,
stop there and photograph.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.210
Circular fracture of the cranial vault.

15:06.544 --> 15:08.379
So his head hit something.

15:08.588 --> 15:10.048
Or something hit his head.

15:19.974 --> 15:23.478
Adhesive tape...
something was here on the dash.

15:23.478 --> 15:28.483
This car was stripped.
Not of its parts, but, uh, emptied out.

15:28.650 --> 15:33.404
This guy was traveling light, too.
There's no wallet.

15:33.696 --> 15:35.865
Maybe I can get an ID
from the VIN number.

15:36.366 --> 15:38.493
You think he drove his
own car to his death?

15:40.620 --> 15:43.748
I think somebody cracked
his skull to knock him unconscious,

15:45.083 --> 15:48.419
shoved him in the trunk, and then
chauffeured him to a watery grave.

15:51.381 --> 15:52.715
A wad of paper ...

15:56.135 --> 15:57.929
$1.50 and a car key.

16:17.073 --> 16:21.869
Oh ... this alters your theory, Delko.
Whoever drove him to his watery grave ...

16:22.370 --> 16:24.455
Handed him the keys first.

16:30.003 --> 16:31.796
Something happened
at that canal.

16:45.685 --> 16:49.022
Neil Diamond CD.
Love songs.

16:49.022 --> 16:51.190
Oh, now we know
why he was killed.

16:55.320 --> 16:56.696
He was alive in there.

17:05.997 --> 17:07.040
Eric Delko.

17:09.459 --> 17:10.292
Yeah, go ahead.

17:11.752 --> 17:14.047
Okay.
All right, thanks.

17:17.258 --> 17:19.135
Autopsy concurs.

17:19.135 --> 17:21.971
Cerebral anoxia and
ventricular tachycardia.

17:22.597 --> 17:23.848
Death by drowning.

17:30.813 --> 17:32.023
I'm going to run the blood.

17:32.857 --> 17:34.692
I'm all over your toolmarks.

17:37.528 --> 17:42.742
Sixty-two wounds and not one nicked
bone or cartilage for a nice toolmark.

17:43.117 --> 17:44.619
An educated torturer.

17:44.619 --> 17:47.747
I guess you're going to have to settle
for the old wound comparison.

17:48.289 --> 17:51.000
All right.
Time to get medieval.

18:53.646 --> 18:55.982
These tools don't
match the wounds.

18:56.524 --> 18:59.319
And worse than that,
the blood on him is canine.

19:02.822 --> 19:05.450
So what in the hell dug
into the professor?

19:13.458 --> 19:15.084
Lorenzo Castanotto?

19:15.710 --> 19:18.713
Call me Larry.
You guys found my car?

19:19.547 --> 19:23.509
Yeah, Larry, we found your car at
the bottom of Snapper Creek Canal.

19:24.010 --> 19:25.011
You know how it got there?

19:25.011 --> 19:26.137
Somebody stole it.

19:27.472 --> 19:29.140
I already got paid by the insurance.

19:29.140 --> 19:31.017
Did you give the thief your car key?

19:32.268 --> 19:33.394
You found the car key?

19:33.394 --> 19:36.522
Inside the pocket of the
dead man stuffed in your trunk.

19:40.276 --> 19:43.738
Hey, we haven't ID'd him yet, but maybe
you could help us out. Take a look.

19:44.489 --> 19:45.615
Yeah, sure.

19:47.992 --> 19:50.161
Be warned, he's a ...
a little bloated.

19:51.204 --> 19:51.996
Oh, my god.

19:51.996 --> 19:54.082
What's the matter, Larry?
You don't recognize him?

20:10.223 --> 20:11.641
Mind if I take this, Larry?

20:11.641 --> 20:14.227
No, you can't take my hula girl.

20:16.312 --> 20:18.773
That's all right.
We'll come back with a warrant.

20:19.274 --> 20:20.566
Knock yourself out.

20:20.900 --> 20:22.235
See you later, Larry.

20:27.991 --> 20:31.119
Who removes a hula girl from
their car right before it's stolen?

20:31.619 --> 20:34.706
same guy that smacked our vic on the
head before he stuffed him in the trunk.

20:34.706 --> 20:36.416
That's right.
Keep me posted.

20:36.416 --> 20:37.458
All right.
Be safe.

20:49.887 --> 20:51.639
Well, that looks
like a match, doesn't it?

20:53.224 --> 20:55.226
Metzger tortured this dog, didn't he?

20:55.226 --> 20:57.061
And then someone tortured him.

20:59.147 --> 21:01.899
We need to figure out
who this dog belongs to.

21:02.734 --> 21:03.860
How?

21:07.405 --> 21:08.531
Hang on a minute.

21:29.260 --> 21:30.428
Well, there you have it.

21:31.971 --> 21:33.806
An identification microchip.

21:34.015 --> 21:35.558
Lojack for dogs.

21:45.652 --> 21:46.694
Ginny Taylor.

21:47.236 --> 21:52.450
So now, her relationship with the professor
officially becomes our business. Good.

22:05.637 --> 22:07.722
Fisher ran away like
three weeks ago.

22:07.722 --> 22:11.100
I put up signs, you know.
I was just hoping that ...

22:12.143 --> 22:14.646
Oh, my god.

22:14.646 --> 22:17.065
Do you have any idea
how he got to the tree?

22:19.776 --> 22:21.444
No, I can't think of ...

22:21.444 --> 22:22.695
Somebody tortured him.

22:25.114 --> 22:26.199
Tortured?

22:26.616 --> 22:27.700
That's right,

22:27.700 --> 22:32.080
and weapons that we found in the Professor's
house matched to the dog's wounds.

22:32.914 --> 22:37.293
What are you saying?
Professor Metzger ... killed Fisher?

22:37.418 --> 22:39.546
His artifacts were
under lock and key.

22:39.546 --> 22:42.006
So he was the only one
who had access.

22:42.006 --> 22:46.719
Ginny, the professor had a very serious
interest in human cruelty, didn't he?

22:46.719 --> 22:50.348
The professor was a genius, okay?
And he taught us ...

22:50.348 --> 22:52.392
About hatred.
Right?

22:52.892 --> 22:56.062
It's more than that.

22:56.062 --> 23:00.108
The professor proved to us
that violence is natural.

23:00.191 --> 23:03.361
Without it humanity would become ...

23:03.361 --> 23:05.446
unbalanced.

23:05.530 --> 23:08.575
Ginny, was the professor
hurting you?

23:14.414 --> 23:16.499
He ...
he was ...

23:23.339 --> 23:28.553
He once asked me to kiss
his shoes and I did.

23:32.932 --> 23:34.017
Who killed him?

23:37.145 --> 23:38.229
I don't know.

23:40.315 --> 23:42.734
Dug through recent teletypes
of local missing persons

23:42.734 --> 23:45.987
and I found one guy that fits bloater
boy's general height and coloring.

23:45.987 --> 23:47.822
Okay, and the mystery man is?

23:47.822 --> 23:48.990
Doug Reid.

23:48.990 --> 23:53.203
Now, he lived with a girlfriend who reported
him missing after the car was stolen.

23:53.203 --> 23:58.416
We're trying to locate family members,
but in the meantime, the girlfriend is ...

24:01.252 --> 24:02.378
Right on time.

24:03.421 --> 24:07.091
That's the only picture I have left.
I ripped up most of the others.

24:07.091 --> 24:08.635
You were living together, right?

24:08.968 --> 24:11.971
Caroline, how long were you with him?

24:12.805 --> 24:15.225
Really long ...
Like three months.

24:16.518 --> 24:19.479
And he was so romantic.

24:19.479 --> 24:22.357
You know that song,
"Sweet Caroline"?

24:22.357 --> 24:23.316
By, um ...

24:23.316 --> 24:24.442
Neil Diamond.

24:24.859 --> 24:28.530
Yeah. He used to sing
that to me all the time,

24:28.655 --> 24:30.740
and we were going
to go to Aruba...

24:32.909 --> 24:37.038
but when he left, I figured all my hints about
vacations must have freaked him out.

24:37.038 --> 24:38.331
What about enemies?

24:39.374 --> 24:40.416
None.

24:41.584 --> 24:42.961
As far as I know.

24:47.632 --> 24:49.342
How's the autopsy
photo I brought?

24:49.759 --> 24:51.761
It's not looking so
good for an I.D.

24:54.764 --> 24:55.807
Wait a second.

25:00.478 --> 25:01.479
Earplugs.

25:02.564 --> 25:03.731
I wonder if they're custom.

25:04.065 --> 25:05.650
Thank god for ears.

25:06.192 --> 25:07.652
Pure cartilage.

25:07.652 --> 25:10.155
Only thing on a bloater
that holds its shape.

25:10.155 --> 25:11.197
That's right.

25:13.575 --> 25:14.617
Hang on.

25:16.327 --> 25:19.998
Reed Metal Works? Reed Metal Works,
that's Larry's place.

25:20.123 --> 25:21.082
Larry?

25:21.082 --> 25:24.002
Suffice it to say, Jade,
the world just got really small.

25:44.522 --> 25:47.817
Hey, I've got my glass slipper.
Now where is my Cinderella?

25:48.234 --> 25:49.527
Cremated yesterday.

25:50.069 --> 25:51.446
No, come on,
you didn't do that to me.

25:51.446 --> 25:53.072
Yeah.

25:53.072 --> 25:55.158
Please don't tell me
you did that to me.

26:35.073 --> 26:35.865
Hey.
Hey.

26:35.865 --> 26:37.826
I tested for epithelials on the rope,

26:37.826 --> 26:41.454
and no go, but I did just identify the
rope itself. It's Guadua Augustifolia.

26:41.454 --> 26:42.372
That's bamboo.

26:42.372 --> 26:44.457
Bicolor variety,
colombian bamboo.

26:44.457 --> 26:47.669
Okay, well, the Dean did say the professor
had interesting guest lecturers, didn't he?

26:47.669 --> 26:50.129
One of whom was a
Colombian prison interrogator,

26:50.129 --> 26:52.298
which is just a really nice
way of saying "torturer."

26:52.298 --> 26:54.259
Torture can be interesting.
Let's bring him in.

26:55.844 --> 26:58.388
Tell me about your
relationship with Metzger.

26:58.596 --> 27:03.810
Señor barbosa, cuando fue la primera
vez que usted contacto al profesor?

27:04.936 --> 27:08.064
Que tipo de relacion tenia
con el profesor?

27:08.648 --> 27:11.442
Usted es una muy buena
estudiante, señorita.

27:12.277 --> 27:14.821
She is not a student.
She's a police officer,

27:14.821 --> 27:18.158
so I suggest you answer her questions
before you have to answer mine.

27:18.158 --> 27:19.534
We're all his students ...

27:21.494 --> 27:23.788
in one relationship or another.

27:24.122 --> 27:25.665
So you do speak english.

27:27.750 --> 27:29.085
The professor ...

27:30.670 --> 27:35.884
did he suffer? Was he left in a ...
humiliating position?

27:38.219 --> 27:40.889
This is about power for
someone like you.

27:40.889 --> 27:44.225
A narcissistic fantasy in
which you degrade somebody...

27:45.435 --> 27:47.729
until they lose their
identity and their soul.

27:52.442 --> 27:56.029
Abuse is more than power.
It is ...

27:56.029 --> 27:57.363
intimacy.

27:57.363 --> 28:01.576
You'd be surprised at how attached
prisoners can get to their jailers ...

28:01.576 --> 28:04.120
their teachers.

28:04.120 --> 28:07.081
So you see yourself
as a teacher, is that it?

28:08.124 --> 28:12.003
Teachers, parents, mentors.

28:12.587 --> 28:14.047
It is how they
start to view us.

28:14.047 --> 28:17.050
That's true.
But most of us, Señor,

28:17.050 --> 28:20.178
arrive at that position through
respect and not force.

28:20.970 --> 28:25.141
An intelligent assessment, lieutenant.
It is not what you do to people.

28:27.268 --> 28:29.145
It's what you get them
to do for you.

28:30.605 --> 28:31.731
Through pain?

28:31.731 --> 28:36.611
Mental skill, not weapons
is your most important tool.

28:36.945 --> 28:40.448
Yes, and it requires an enormous
amount of mental ability...

28:40.448 --> 28:42.534
to slice someone up
and tie them in a tree.

28:42.659 --> 28:46.538
I would agree.
I would ...

28:47.330 --> 28:48.373
agree.

28:50.834 --> 28:51.668
Take a look at those ...

28:54.337 --> 28:55.380
Señor.

29:00.802 --> 29:03.429
Are these an example of your skill?

29:07.475 --> 29:09.686
I'm really sorry to disappoint you,
Lieutenant.

29:10.311 --> 29:11.354
How's that?

29:16.985 --> 29:18.528
Yo soy inocente.

29:19.988 --> 29:22.615
The flexor tendons in his
hand are severed.

29:22.615 --> 29:24.075
He couldn't even
pick up a pencil.

29:24.784 --> 29:26.828
Let alone string a
man up in a tree.

29:27.871 --> 29:31.207
A gift to the new
regime from the old,

29:31.207 --> 29:32.667
I suppose, courtesy
of a machete.

29:33.293 --> 29:36.588
Torture the torturer.
It makes sense.

29:36.588 --> 29:37.964
So he's not our killer.

29:59.569 --> 30:00.612
Oye.

30:01.237 --> 30:02.614
How'd the hula girl match up?

30:02.697 --> 30:03.573
Dead on.

30:03.573 --> 30:05.283
And speaking of the dead?

30:06.201 --> 30:08.411
Doug is indeed Doug.

30:12.332 --> 30:13.333
Okay.

30:15.168 --> 30:16.252
So what's that?

30:16.252 --> 30:20.924
A piece of paper Megan found in
bloater boy ... Doug's pocket.

30:23.635 --> 30:25.220
A travel brochure.

30:25.220 --> 30:29.182
Yeah, for Aruba.
Doug wasn't gun-shy after all.

30:32.560 --> 30:33.561
There's writing.

30:34.521 --> 30:35.563
Directions.

30:37.857 --> 30:42.028
"Take bus 15 to F.R."

30:42.529 --> 30:43.613
F.R.?

30:45.281 --> 30:46.449
Flip it over.

30:46.616 --> 30:49.869
I don't know if I can without ripping it.
I'll try. Let's see.

31:06.427 --> 31:07.887
Well, hello, Larry.

31:10.598 --> 31:11.641
Officers.

31:13.393 --> 31:14.144
What can I do you for?

31:14.144 --> 31:16.604
Well, you can start by answering
a few more questions.

31:16.938 --> 31:19.732
Yeah, we identified
the body in your trunk...

31:19.732 --> 31:22.861
and it turns out he used to
work for Reed Metal Works, too.

31:24.112 --> 31:28.825
We also found your name on a
deposit slip inside the guy's pocket.

31:29.784 --> 31:30.910
I don't know what
you're talking about.

31:30.910 --> 31:33.121
Insurance fraud gets two to six.

31:33.121 --> 31:34.706
Murder's quite a bit more.

31:35.748 --> 31:39.252
Okay, yes. Doug and I were going
to make some money on my car,

31:39.252 --> 31:40.837
but I did not kill the guy,
I swear to god.

31:40.837 --> 31:45.550
You got an alibi? Yeah.
I was at the dog track, Flagstone Ridge.

31:45.550 --> 31:47.719
I even paid with a credit card,
you can check it out.

31:48.511 --> 31:51.097
That's handy.
I swear, Doug was my friend.

31:52.307 --> 31:54.809
I would have no reason
whatsoever to kill the guy.

31:59.522 --> 32:00.523
Is that right?

32:02.901 --> 32:05.653
Hey. Go home.
Get some rest.

32:06.196 --> 32:07.071
I can't.

32:08.364 --> 32:09.532
At this point I'm addicted.

32:10.200 --> 32:11.242
What do you got?

32:11.242 --> 32:17.499
"The experiments with the dog
exceeded my expectations.

32:18.208 --> 32:22.754
Standing under the tree taking notes
I could feel my assistant breaking."

32:22.754 --> 32:26.174
So maybe torturing the dog was
designed to torture someone else.

32:32.972 --> 32:34.724
I actually felt sorry for this guy.

32:34.724 --> 32:39.646
All right, so they all did things for him,
but who was the assistant?

32:40.230 --> 32:42.273
Maybe the person that
shredded all these notes.

32:42.273 --> 32:45.109
Or maybe whoever it was that
typed them up in the first place.

32:46.444 --> 32:49.239
Computer keyboard has at
least twenty-six places.

32:49.239 --> 32:53.409
Yes, for nervous hands
to leave sweaty fingerprints.

33:03.368 --> 33:06.121
Maybe there are more torture
items than in the closet.

33:08.206 --> 33:09.791
There's no prints on the keyboard.

33:12.085 --> 33:13.837
Everything's wiped down.

33:35.984 --> 33:38.153
Okay, folks,
this is what I think happened.

33:38.153 --> 33:40.363
I don't think the assistant
was wiping down for prints.

33:40.363 --> 33:42.449
I think the assistant was
wiping down for blood.

34:10.435 --> 34:13.146
And there is the six-inch ice pick.

34:13.146 --> 34:15.190
There's no way that's
more than five inches.

34:15.190 --> 34:17.984
Metzger's body must've caved
under the thrust of it.

34:20.779 --> 34:23.281
Leading naturally to an
overestimate on the weapon.

34:23.697 --> 34:25.449
Hey, you might want
to take a look at this.

34:25.659 --> 34:26.826
Okay.

34:29.955 --> 34:31.498
Maybe the retinal
damage was caused ...

34:31.498 --> 34:34.542
by staring in the incandescent
light for a hundred copies.

34:34.542 --> 34:37.254
Well, that would explain the
Miami Snow blindness, wouldn't it?

34:37.462 --> 34:41.632
I found Metzger's eye opener.
Super glue

34:53.228 --> 34:55.355
That ...
is a death mask.

34:56.188 --> 34:59.442
Too bad the killer didn't
leave a picture of himself.

35:01.027 --> 35:02.028
Or herself.

35:04.447 --> 35:05.490
Wait a minute.

35:06.449 --> 35:07.701
Shine your light right there.

35:15.542 --> 35:16.584
It's cotton.

35:17.919 --> 35:20.213
Who wears cotton sweaters
in eighty degrees?

35:21.881 --> 35:22.674
Yes?

35:22.674 --> 35:25.885
Hi, Teresa, I have a
warrant for your taser.

35:26.928 --> 35:27.887
Taser?

35:29.014 --> 35:31.933
Look, there's, uh,
two ways we can do this.

35:46.656 --> 35:47.657
Thanks.

35:51.828 --> 35:52.829
Clever.

35:54.914 --> 35:56.625
Hey.
Hey.

35:59.127 --> 36:00.170
So ...

36:01.671 --> 36:03.965
we got an accident
reconstruction program.

36:04.591 --> 36:08.762
Yeah, but the two people
who look guilty have air-tight alibis...

36:08.762 --> 36:12.974
and somehow, my vic got in his car
and that car went in the river.

36:12.974 --> 36:14.142
Okay.

36:14.142 --> 36:18.772
Now, the center of gravity is forward
because of the engine and the slope.

36:18.772 --> 36:21.066
But when I run the
coefficient of friction,

36:21.066 --> 36:23.568
even with Doug in the trunk,
the car doesn't move.

36:24.653 --> 36:27.364
What was the condition
of the ground that night?

36:27.364 --> 36:29.699
I programmed
it in as rocks and dirt.

36:29.699 --> 36:31.159
Rocks and dirt.

36:31.576 --> 36:32.786
Wet or dry?

36:36.623 --> 36:38.375
I'll check the weather report.

36:38.583 --> 36:39.626
Let's do that.

36:44.714 --> 36:46.633
There was a hard
rain that night.

36:46.967 --> 36:50.428
Love those computers, but it's always
better to see the crime in context.

36:51.179 --> 36:53.598
So, I'll be Doug, okay?

36:53.598 --> 36:55.642
So, my plan is to dump the car,

36:55.642 --> 36:59.396
I take my buck-50,
I hop on bus 15 back to Kendell,

37:00.146 --> 37:04.734
return the key to Larry, collect my money,
and purchase a vacation for my girlfriend.

37:05.151 --> 37:09.114
So, he tries to dump the car,
but ends up in the trunk instead.

37:09.823 --> 37:10.699
Let's find out why.

37:10.699 --> 37:12.575
Okay. Um ...

37:13.952 --> 37:15.412
The car's in neutral ...

37:16.746 --> 37:18.206
and the emergency break is off.

37:21.001 --> 37:25.297
Mud slippage changes the coefficient of
friction from point seven to point three.

37:25.422 --> 37:30.635
So you, Doug, get out of the car
and is about to push it in.

37:32.470 --> 37:35.557
When I go to the trunk to open it.
Why?

37:37.017 --> 37:38.184
Neil Diamond.

37:41.313 --> 37:43.481
You're right.
You're right.

37:43.481 --> 37:47.235
I'm a hopeless romantic and
I'm listening to "Sweet Caroline" ...

37:47.235 --> 37:50.322
while I'm preparing to take
a vacation with my own Caroline.

37:50.322 --> 37:51.406
So ...

37:51.406 --> 37:53.074
You open the trunk,

37:53.700 --> 37:57.037
but can't reach
behind the cd changer.

37:57.787 --> 37:59.205
Okay, so I climb in ...

38:02.667 --> 38:04.002
And slip ...
Wait a minute.

38:07.130 --> 38:11.301
There's your blunt-force
trauma right there.

38:46.795 --> 38:48.088
Things we do for love.

38:49.881 --> 38:52.509
Metzger was a very demanding man,
wasn't he, Teresa?

38:54.177 --> 38:56.429
Everyone thought he was a genius.

38:56.429 --> 39:01.351
They thought he was funny
and inspiring.

39:01.351 --> 39:04.396
But he wasn't on a mission
to torture them, was he?

39:05.438 --> 39:06.439
What do you mean?

39:07.357 --> 39:08.400
I think you know.

39:10.110 --> 39:14.072
Over the course of the last year
he broke you down.

39:14.072 --> 39:15.949
He took a happy,
healthy young woman

39:15.949 --> 39:18.326
and turned her into a
destructive creature, didn't he?

39:18.326 --> 39:19.369
No.

39:19.494 --> 39:21.871
No?
Take a look at your arms.

39:34.301 --> 39:36.011
I respected him so much.

39:36.344 --> 39:38.013
And that's what he depended on.

39:44.185 --> 39:46.438
He started with the dog.

39:46.646 --> 39:48.481
Who am I to correct a professor?

39:48.481 --> 39:51.818
Teresa, we matched burn marks
on the professor to your taser.

39:51.818 --> 39:53.403
Why would I do that?

39:53.820 --> 39:55.447
This is what you call writing?!

39:55.447 --> 39:57.949
You're a mental defective,
do you understand me?!

39:57.949 --> 40:01.369
You've got no brains at all!
You're a trust-fund-baby bimbo!

40:01.453 --> 40:05.206
Shut up!
Shut up!

40:06.249 --> 40:08.835
Huh?
Am I a moron?!

40:08.919 --> 40:13.089
We have also matched his
lacerations to the staple remover.

40:36.738 --> 40:39.366
So you walked him out to the woods,

40:39.866 --> 40:43.828
filled with anger and adrenaline,
and strung him up in the tree.

40:44.913 --> 40:48.875
Come on! Take it off!
Right now!

40:48.875 --> 40:50.835
Okay!
Strip off.

41:17.487 --> 41:20.282
I would imagine that
the worst part for you...

41:20.282 --> 41:24.119
was finding out that you'd
been an experiment all along.

41:27.205 --> 41:29.040
Had I known that I was a test,

41:30.083 --> 41:32.127
that he didn't mean all
those things that he said,

41:33.378 --> 41:35.046
I wouldn't have snapped.

41:39.801 --> 41:41.261
But I'm glad he's dead.

41:44.389 --> 41:48.018
After six hours of torture,
I bet he is, too.
