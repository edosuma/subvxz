- Hey.

You're a mess.

01:41.767 --> 01:43.668
You get used to it.

01:46.939 --> 01:49.607
- They found Rabbit yet?
- Not yet.

- Yeah, he won't let me see them.

You really think that's who you are?

02:30.581 --> 02:32.815

02:34.685 --> 02:36.686
But they're my children.

02:43.359 --> 02:47.262
That hearing is coming up and God only

02:47.363 --> 02:49.231
They know who I am now,

02:49.332 --> 02:51.867
but you can't afford to
have your cover blown.

02:53.937 --> 02:56.605

02:57.940 --> 03:00.842

this morning, I got worried.

03:54.228 --> 03:56.096
I'm sorry.

04:00.501 --> 04:05.505
You know, it would be so easy to
just walk down there and apologize.

04:05.606 --> 04:07.541
And as long as I said
all the right things,

04:07.642 --> 04:09.576
I could be back in my bed tonight.

04:09.677 --> 04:12.312
I thought you had made peace
with your decision to leave.

04:14.048 --> 04:16.483
I killed that man, the Mayor.

04:16.584 --> 04:19.752
You didn't know he was in
there and neither did I.

04:19.853 --> 04:21.553
You really didn't know he was in there?

04:21.654 --> 04:25.191
I never lied to you, Rebecca,
and I'm not gonna start now.

04:26.727 --> 04:29.195

to know there will be casualties.

04:29.296 --> 04:30.830

04:30.931 --> 04:33.432

04:48.748 --> 04:52.884
- Okay.

Hey, I'm recovering
from a gunshot wound.

05:46.141 --> 05:49.209
That's right, you got shot
because you slow as shit.

05:49.310 --> 05:52.078
How many times can
you bury the same guy?

05:52.180 --> 05:54.181
We wouldn't be out here if your lazy ass

05:54.282 --> 05:56.082
had dug a deep enough
hole the first time.

05:56.184 --> 05:58.284
Shut up and grab his feet.

05:59.453 --> 06:01.487

Agent Racine? Dean Xavier.

08:04.541 --> 08:06.342
<i>You made good time.</i>

08:06.443 --> 08:08.478
Not good enough.

08:09.780 --> 08:11.313
What do you have for me here?

08:11.414 --> 08:14.884
We got a couple of
bodies that don't add up.

08:17.287 --> 08:19.655
We've got positive IDs on these two.

08:19.756 --> 08:22.958
Charles Randall and Delmont Munson.

08:23.059 --> 08:27.329
- Should that mean something to me?
- No. They're local.

08:27.430 --> 08:29.531
But there was a third
body that we found.

08:29.632 --> 08:33.168
- Teeth missing, fingers filed.
- But two days after we dug him up,

08:33.269 --> 08:36.037
someone broke in here
and stole the body.

08:36.138 --> 08:38.472
Sorry, you can't smoke in here.

08:42.144 --> 08:44.111
<i>Turns out we were able
to get some DNA samples</i>

08:44.212 --> 08:45.947
from the clothing that he was buried in.

08:46.048 --> 08:47.448
<i>I've already sent the kit out.</i>

08:47.549 --> 08:50.151
You're showing this to me why?

08:51.653 --> 08:54.655
Well, just thought
it might be pertinent?

08:57.392 --> 09:02.896
These bodies date back, what,
about three or four months?

09:02.997 --> 09:06.400
<i>Coroner's got them at 16, 17 weeks.</i>

09:06.501 --> 09:09.637
So long before Rabbit showed up here

09:09.738 --> 09:12.039
and everyone started shooting.

09:12.140 --> 09:14.809
Well, yes, but there's
other things going on here.

09:14.909 --> 09:16.910
<i>These two guys worked for Kai Proctor.</i>

09:17.011 --> 09:20.647
- I'm sorry, I forgot your name.
- Xavier. Dean Xavier.

09:20.748 --> 09:24.251
Agent Xavier, I didn't come out
here to clean up all your messes.

09:24.352 --> 09:26.186
Just the one.

09:27.989 --> 09:30.190
<i>Uh...</i>

09:44.538 --> 09:48.541
Deputy Emmett Yawners.
Deputy Brock Lotus.

09:48.642 --> 09:51.543
Deputy Siobhan Kelly.

09:58.551 --> 10:00.586
Lucas Hood.

10:10.764 --> 10:13.164
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Special Agent Jim Racine.

10:13.266 --> 10:15.868
You all know Agent Xavier. Let me
tell you how this is gonna work.

10:15.968 --> 10:19.070
<i>This is a closed federal hearing</i>

10:19.171 --> 10:21.807
<i>in which you will be
delivering sworn testimony,</i>

10:21.908 --> 10:26.044
<i>'cause everyone knows swearing
on a Bible keeps people honest.</i>

10:26.145 --> 10:28.546
You do have a right to
have an attorney present.

10:28.647 --> 10:30.748
And I should inform you that
if you exercise that right,

10:30.849 --> 10:33.751
you will earn my immediate
and eternal suspicion.

10:34.954 --> 10:37.488
I'll call you in one by one
to answer questions.

10:37.589 --> 10:39.690
If you answer to my satisfaction,

10:39.792 --> 10:42.259
this will probably be the
last time we see each other.

10:42.360 --> 10:45.663
I understand your
Mayor recently suffered

10:45.764 --> 10:48.433
the misfortune of being blown up.

10:50.101 --> 10:54.371
This town is something else.
I've asked Mr. Hopewell

10:54.473 --> 10:57.441
<i>to serve as a witness
to these proceedings.</i>

10:57.542 --> 10:59.609
As he's married to Mrs. Hopewell,

10:59.710 --> 11:02.179
<i>he's not exactly an
objective party here.</i>

11:02.280 --> 11:05.515
But since he will play no part in
the resolution of these findings

11:05.616 --> 11:09.219
and since everyone in this
town seems to be connected

11:09.220 --> 11:12.823
in some way to everyone else,
I'm gonna let that slide.

11:14.058 --> 11:15.959
Any questions?

11:19.464 --> 11:21.965
No? Okay.

11:23.568 --> 11:25.802
Come on, let's get started.

12:04.273 --> 12:06.508
State your name for the record.

12:06.609 --> 12:08.243
Lucas Hood.

12:08.344 --> 12:12.080
- You're the Sheriff?
- I am.

12:12.181 --> 12:14.816
<i>Okay, then, Sheriff Hood,</i>

12:14.917 --> 12:18.620
why don't you tell me when you first
came in contact with Mr. Rabbit.

12:18.721 --> 12:21.255
Some of his men shot up the Cadi.

12:25.260 --> 12:27.194
And you didn't kill
the men who shot at you?

12:27.295 --> 12:29.430
- Nope.
- So who did?

12:35.370 --> 12:36.770
No idea.

12:38.240 --> 12:40.007
And Rabbit was there?

12:40.108 --> 12:44.545
- What do you want, Rabbit?
- To be the last face you ever saw.

12:44.646 --> 12:49.350
Yes. Although, at that point,
I didn't know who he was.

12:49.451 --> 12:51.618
So just to be clear,

12:51.719 --> 12:54.688
at no point in your life
before the events of that month

12:54.789 --> 12:58.892
had you met or spoken to
or had any kinds of dealings

12:58.993 --> 13:00.393
with the gangster known as Rabbit?

13:00.494 --> 13:01.728
Correct.

13:01.829 --> 13:06.833
But he spent about 1,000 bullets,
lost three men trying to kill you.

13:06.935 --> 13:09.001
- Any idea why?
- No idea.

13:09.103 --> 13:12.905
- You sticking with that story?
- Yes.

13:13.006 --> 13:15.542
<i>Mrs. Hopewell, how
would you characterize</i>

13:15.642 --> 13:17.143
<i>your relationship with the sheriff?</i>

13:17.244 --> 13:20.380
I don't know. Cordial, I guess.

13:20.481 --> 13:23.743
So not to put too fine a point on it,

13:23.744 --> 13:27.179
- were you fucking him?
- Excuse me?

13:27.180 --> 13:28.921
<i>Excuse my language.</i>

13:29.022 --> 13:32.725
Were you involved in a sexual
relationship with the sheriff?

13:32.826 --> 13:35.160
Of course not.

13:36.463 --> 13:40.199
It's been my experience that when a man
puts himself through that kind of hell,

13:40.300 --> 13:43.802
it's a pretty safe bet that there's
some sex somewhere in the equation.

13:43.903 --> 13:47.973
<i>So, just to clarify...</i>

13:49.209 --> 13:51.666
you weren't fucking him?

13:53.846 --> 13:55.247
No.

13:55.348 --> 13:58.083
<i>She told me that her
father was a gangster,</i>

13:58.183 --> 14:00.585
that she had been hiding
from him for years,

14:00.686 --> 14:03.521
<i>and that now he'd found her.</i>

14:03.623 --> 14:07.191
In addition to asking for your help,
she asked you to keep it a secret?

14:07.292 --> 14:09.160
<i>- Yes.
- Even from her husband?</i>

14:10.863 --> 14:13.498
- Yes.
- Which you did.

14:15.033 --> 14:16.200
Yes.

14:16.301 --> 14:21.239
Back in the day,
before you went AWOL,

14:21.340 --> 14:23.508
there was a prevailing opinion
on the organized crime desk

14:23.609 --> 14:27.978
that you were an integral
part of the organization.

14:30.815 --> 14:32.616
Is there a question in there?

14:32.717 --> 14:34.685
No.

14:37.622 --> 14:39.556
No question at all.

14:39.658 --> 14:41.659
<i>By your own account, he had
you down there for a few hours.</i>

14:41.760 --> 14:44.795
- He must have said something.
- He said a lot of things.

14:51.202 --> 14:53.836
<i>Sheriff Hood?</i>

14:56.307 --> 14:58.275
<i>Sheriff Hood?</i>

14:58.376 --> 15:02.546
- Excuse me?
- I asked you what some of those things were.

15:04.048 --> 15:06.683
What did Rabbit talk about?

15:08.652 --> 15:12.621
You took my only daughter from me.

15:12.723 --> 15:15.725
There are no words to express the pain.

15:21.531 --> 15:24.233
Sorry, I'm...

15:24.334 --> 15:29.471
I'm not 100% yet.
Um... yeah.

15:29.573 --> 15:33.275
- He spoke mainly in Russian.
- Ukrainian.

15:34.377 --> 15:36.945
Yeah, well, it's all Greek to me.

15:37.046 --> 15:42.317
Moving on.
This business with the metalworks.

15:42.418 --> 15:46.588
- What the hell was that about?
- We knew they had Sheriff Hood.

15:48.290 --> 15:50.658
<i>And that he'd be killed very
quickly if we didn't act.</i>

15:50.760 --> 15:53.528
- I see. And who told you that?
- Mrs. Hopewell.

15:54.697 --> 15:57.632
- You just took her word for it?
- She was very convincing.

16:00.603 --> 16:02.169
She told us she a past with Rabbit

16:02.271 --> 16:03.971
which explained why he
had taken her son earlier

16:04.072 --> 16:06.474
and that Sheriff Hood had
traded himself for the boy.

16:06.575 --> 16:09.376
You often go into battles
with civilians for backup?

16:09.477 --> 16:11.846
There were mitigating factors.
We had to move immediately.

16:15.516 --> 16:19.519
I don't know. 13, 14 guys.
I lost count.

16:19.621 --> 16:22.990
They were all using machine guns.
I couldn't hear myself think.

16:24.459 --> 16:25.359
<i> I'm out!</i>

16:25.460 --> 16:27.093
First two caught me in my vest.

16:28.630 --> 16:30.096
Then I took one in the leg.

16:31.499 --> 16:34.167
We had no idea they'd
be that heavily armed.

16:36.837 --> 16:39.973
There was a guy up on the stacks laying
down cover fire with a machine gun.

16:41.376 --> 16:43.977
- Who took him out?
- Mrs. Hopewell.

16:46.947 --> 16:48.248
Mrs. Hopewell.

16:50.017 --> 16:51.151
Mrs. Hopewell.

16:52.452 --> 16:53.452
<i>Ah!</i>

16:53.553 --> 16:57.723
Two shots... one to the chest,
one somewhere around the neck.

16:57.825 --> 17:02.528
That must have been hard
for you to shoot your own father.

17:02.629 --> 17:04.530
Good-bye, Daddy.

17:06.700 --> 17:09.535
Well, he kidnapped my son
and threatened my family.

17:09.636 --> 17:12.672
My father was an evil and twisted man.

17:12.772 --> 17:15.174
No, he wasn't.

17:18.811 --> 17:23.415
He is an evil and twisted man.
He's not dead.

17:23.516 --> 17:27.118
- I shot him point-blank.
- Well, then I guess it was his corpse

17:27.220 --> 17:28.753
that got up and walked
out of that building.

17:28.855 --> 17:31.589
I saw him go down.
He couldn't have survived.

17:31.691 --> 17:33.257
- And even if...
- He's not dead!

18:07.058 --> 18:11.094
<i> Normally we review
testimony over a period of weeks.</i>

18:11.195 --> 18:13.964
<i>But if I've learned anything
in my years of doing this,</i>

18:14.065 --> 18:18.669
<i>it's that bullshit will stay
bullshit no matter how long.</i>

18:18.770 --> 18:21.037
<i>I think we've had our fill today.</i>

18:22.240 --> 18:24.107
<i>And fortunately after years of meetings,</i>

18:24.208 --> 18:28.245
I have been granted the serenity to
accept the things I cannot change.

18:31.215 --> 18:33.149
I think we can all
agree that you all showed

18:33.251 --> 18:38.287
some monumentally bad judgment.
At the same time,

18:38.389 --> 18:41.858
a group of hardened criminals
was setting up shop in your town.

18:41.958 --> 18:44.360
Desperate times and so on.

18:44.461 --> 18:47.329
The bottom line is

18:47.431 --> 18:49.932
this town needs its
sheriff's department.

18:51.101 --> 18:55.204
<i>Lucas Hood, you were not on active
duty on the night in question.</i>

18:55.305 --> 18:57.539
<i>You had surrendered
your firearm and badge</i>

18:57.640 --> 19:01.410
<i>and were for all intents and
purposes an endangered civilian.</i>

19:01.511 --> 19:05.114
As far as I can tell, you
weren't doing any of the shooting.

19:05.215 --> 19:07.482
As such, I've got no
book to throw at you.

19:10.353 --> 19:12.454
Congratulations, you're
the sheriff again.

19:16.025 --> 19:18.226
<i>Deputy Lotus.</i>

19:19.161 --> 19:21.563
<i>You were in charge that night.</i>

19:21.664 --> 19:25.266
As such, I'm gonna
throw you under the bus.

19:26.769 --> 19:29.203
But you also got shot trying
to rescue one of your own.

19:29.305 --> 19:30.738
That makes you something of a hero.

19:30.839 --> 19:36.311
So 18 months probation
and a letter of censure in your jacket.

19:36.412 --> 19:38.146
Are you kidding me?
You cannot come in here... !

19:38.247 --> 19:40.815
You want to take this up the
ladder, you go right ahead.

19:40.916 --> 19:43.051
The protocol breaches alone would
be grounds for a criminal hearing.

19:43.152 --> 19:46.420
- I don't know how the hell... !
- You won the fucking lottery with me today!

19:46.521 --> 19:49.222
<i>And this is where a smart
man would shut the hell up.</i>

19:50.659 --> 19:53.360
Deputies Yawners and Kelly,
12 months probation.

19:53.462 --> 19:55.395
Either of you does anything
that even raises an eyebrow

19:55.497 --> 19:57.164
in my office and you're unemployed.

19:59.033 --> 20:02.569
And the BSD will be under federal
oversight for the next two years.

20:02.670 --> 20:05.205
<i>Every arrest, every
call, every traffic ticket</i>

20:05.306 --> 20:06.773
<i>will be subject to my review.</i>

20:06.874 --> 20:09.876
So you had better make sure
you do it all by the book.

20:22.723 --> 20:24.757
I've got to go. I'm late.

20:28.028 --> 20:31.664
How can you let them all off like that?
There were two other civilians!

20:31.765 --> 20:34.300
The bartender had priors.
You didn't even charge them.

20:34.401 --> 20:37.503
Local criminal elements are
the sheriff's problem, not mine.

20:37.604 --> 20:39.505
But why are they any
different than Mrs. Hopewell?

20:39.606 --> 20:43.575
Because they are not the daughters
of a Ukrainian crime lord.

20:43.676 --> 20:46.879
The US Attorney's office authorized you

20:46.980 --> 20:49.748
- to conduct a full-scale hearing...
- Oh, for fuck's sake.

20:49.849 --> 20:53.485
- Xavier, I've got bigger fish to fry.
- Your fish is dead!

20:53.586 --> 20:55.754
<i>You're so obsessed with finding this
Rabbit that you're losing sight...</i>

20:55.855 --> 20:58.456
He's not dead! You'd have
another body to show me.

20:58.558 --> 21:00.692
Rabbit's got a fucking
river of blood on his hands

21:00.793 --> 21:03.261
and you want to waste my time
on small-town shenanigans?

21:03.362 --> 21:05.263
How are you gonna explain what
you did in there to Washington?

21:05.364 --> 21:06.964
- It won't hold up.
- It's Banshee, Pennsylvania!

21:07.066 --> 21:11.802
- No one gives a shit!
- Let go of me.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.613
Look, I'll be dead pretty soon, Xavier.

21:24.482 --> 21:27.051
My cancer has got cancer.

21:29.320 --> 21:31.789
But I am going to spend
some small amount of time

21:31.890 --> 21:36.427
on this planet...
knowing that bastard isn't on it.

21:40.565 --> 21:42.933
And whatever his
unresolved issues are here,

21:43.034 --> 21:48.439
I want them all right where they are
so he can find them when he's ready.

21:50.341 --> 21:54.878
- You're using them as bait?
- That's what you do with little fish.

21:54.979 --> 21:57.547
This is my case.

21:57.648 --> 22:04.287
No, your case was Proctor,
who has somehow

22:04.388 --> 22:08.257
managed to be the only guy in this
town not involved in this shit show.

22:10.294 --> 22:12.062
Seems to me, Agent Xavier,

22:12.162 --> 22:16.932
your mishandling of things here
has led to a lot of dead bodies

22:17.033 --> 22:21.003
and a pretty serious amount
of reckless endangerment.

22:21.105 --> 22:27.843
- What the hell are you talking about?
- You can go down for this

22:27.944 --> 22:30.178
or you can take a reassignment.

22:31.481 --> 22:33.548
Oh, shit, I'm late.

22:36.486 --> 22:38.453
<i>Pack your bags.</i>

22:39.856 --> 22:42.324
<i>You'll have new marching
orders by tonight.</i>

22:45.995 --> 22:48.063
Mrs. Hopewell.

22:48.664 --> 22:52.467
As a civilian, you don't fall
under the same federal statutes

22:52.568 --> 22:54.869
as the sworn members of law enforcement,

22:54.970 --> 22:58.206
so I'm turning your case
over to the DA's office.

22:58.307 --> 23:01.376
You'll be charged with
unlawful possession of a firearm

23:01.477 --> 23:04.211
and obstruction of justice,

23:04.312 --> 23:07.148
whatever other charges they can drum up

23:07.249 --> 23:10.118
in regard to your involvement
on the night in question.

23:10.218 --> 23:14.388
- They took my son.
- That is...

23:14.489 --> 23:20.494
unless you can shed some light
on where Daddy might be holed up.

23:21.663 --> 23:23.631
If you were to aid in my investigation,

23:23.731 --> 23:27.535
then I might find a way to
make those charges disappear.

23:27.636 --> 23:30.737
If I knew where he was, don't
you think I would tell you?

23:30.838 --> 23:33.106
After everything I heard in there,

23:33.208 --> 23:37.077
I have no idea
what you would or wouldn't do.

23:37.178 --> 23:39.545
You're a bastard.

23:41.482 --> 23:43.910
I'd lawyer up, then.

23:45.953 --> 23:47.787
<i>Good luck in court.</i>

23:51.692 --> 23:56.162
- Gordon.
- How's the leg?

23:56.263 --> 23:58.164
Ah, it's getting there.

24:00.634 --> 24:03.936
- You believe this shit?
- What, after everything else,

24:04.037 --> 24:06.172
this is the part you
find hard to believe?

24:06.273 --> 24:10.976
Hey, Gordon, I'm sorry.
I know your family's been through a lot.

24:12.378 --> 24:15.948
- Listen, if there's anything I can do...
- Well, maybe there is.

24:20.353 --> 24:22.487
I want you to keep
an eye on Hood for me.

24:22.589 --> 24:25.757
Anything out of the ordinary,
I want to be the first call you make.

24:25.858 --> 24:29.261
- That's pretty much everything.
- Well, that's my point.

24:29.362 --> 24:31.830
Now you got a place to come to.

25:53.010 --> 25:55.311
You gonna put that
badge back on or what?

25:55.412 --> 25:57.880
I didn't want to rub it in.

25:57.981 --> 26:00.183
After what we went through
to bring you back...

26:01.484 --> 26:03.352
damn well better wear it.

26:05.021 --> 26:07.656
- Hey.
- Yeah?

26:07.757 --> 26:11.927
- Thank you.
- Yeah, well...

26:12.028 --> 26:14.930
let's see how long you can stay
out of trouble this time, huh?

26:18.535 --> 26:20.869
<i>We dodge a federal
probe by the skin of our teeth</i>

26:20.970 --> 26:23.939
<i>and the first thing we do is
go out and rob an armored truck?</i>

26:24.040 --> 26:26.274
<i>Quit your whining
and pop those doors.</i>

26:27.710 --> 26:30.011
Whoo! Flip that bitch!

26:38.854 --> 26:41.956
<i>...floating high to deep center field!</i>

26:42.057 --> 26:43.891
<i>Come on, baby.</i>

26:50.899 --> 26:52.433
Okay, let's go.

26:59.107 --> 27:01.942
- Time.
- Okay, I'll be right behind you.

27:04.312 --> 27:06.546
- What the hell is going on?
- We're being jacked.

27:19.660 --> 27:21.060
Grab him.

27:23.330 --> 27:25.098
Oh, fuck me.

27:30.004 --> 27:31.337
Motherfucker!

27:39.780 --> 27:40.813
You hit 'em?

27:49.355 --> 27:51.123
Ana, stay with them.

27:51.224 --> 27:53.158
What? Oh, don't even
think about it, baby.

27:53.259 --> 27:55.227
No, we don't have fucking time.
Fuck!

27:55.328 --> 27:57.630
<i>What is he doing?</i>

27:57.731 --> 27:59.264
<i>God damn it!</i>

28:00.800 --> 28:03.868
<i>Get back in here.
We're coming up on the split.</i>

28:03.970 --> 28:08.440
<i>I'm turning in three,
two, one.</i>

28:24.723 --> 28:27.892
- Hi.
- Hi.

28:30.896 --> 28:33.797
Dude, I'm pretty sure
this is the ugliest color.

28:33.898 --> 28:36.267
- You like these? No?
- You can do better.

28:36.368 --> 28:38.802
I think these would be hot, though.

28:38.903 --> 28:41.238
- Oh, my God, they match your hair.
- They're perfect.

28:41.340 --> 28:43.040
Uh, no, no. You're crazy.

28:43.141 --> 28:45.476
<i>- All the boys would love that.
- My grandma would seriously wear these.</i>

28:45.577 --> 28:48.679
Ew.
Oh, I actually like these.

28:48.780 --> 28:50.948
<i>- Kind of cool.
- Those are hot.</i>

28:51.048 --> 28:52.950
<i>- Yeah, I like these.
- You should get them.</i>

28:53.050 --> 28:56.687
<i>I don't know.
I don't think I need them, right?</i>

28:57.689 --> 29:01.124
- Yeah.
- All right, I think we're good.

29:01.225 --> 29:03.193
<i>Yeah.</i>

29:04.362 --> 29:06.429
<i>- Thank you.
- Thanks.</i>

29:10.434 --> 29:12.902
Excuse me, girls.

29:13.004 --> 29:14.504
<i>- Come here.
- What? What?</i>

29:14.605 --> 29:16.606
<i>- Can I see what's in your bag?
- What do you want?</i>

29:27.117 --> 29:28.517
Fuck my shit.

29:28.618 --> 29:31.020
- Get down!
- Shit!

29:38.061 --> 29:41.030
- Who the fuck is that?
- How the hell should I know?

29:42.398 --> 29:44.799
- Well, will you shoot him already?
- Oh!

29:50.272 --> 29:52.106
Drive! Drive!

30:10.959 --> 30:13.594
Fuck. Oh, shit.

30:17.899 --> 30:19.567
- Let's go.
- God damn it!

30:19.668 --> 30:21.168
That motherfucker can shoot.

30:31.012 --> 30:32.679
Okay, let's go. Go, go, go!

30:36.717 --> 30:39.052
Let's go, let's go!

30:39.153 --> 30:40.620
<i>Go! Go, go!</i>

30:50.998 --> 30:55.768
- Ah, shit.
- I love it when a plan comes together.

30:55.869 --> 30:57.503
Shut the fuck up and drive.

31:08.582 --> 31:11.484
So you want the good news
or the bad news first?

31:12.486 --> 31:14.286
What happened?
Who the hell was that?

31:14.387 --> 31:15.854
I don't know.

31:15.955 --> 31:18.657
- I thought you said you had this handled?
- It was.

31:18.758 --> 31:21.392
Maybe we should review
your definition of "handled."

31:21.494 --> 31:22.894
The guards weren't tipped off

31:22.996 --> 31:25.430
or Job never would have made
it past dispatch this morning.

31:25.531 --> 31:26.945
I don't know who that was,

31:26.946 --> 31:29.067
but it wasn't Kinaho security
and it wasn't the cops.

31:30.302 --> 31:32.871
<i>We got well over 100 grand here.</i>

31:32.972 --> 31:35.173
It's not what we were going
for, but it's something.

31:35.274 --> 31:36.975
All that planning,
man, and we got rolled

31:37.076 --> 31:38.676
like a bunch of motherfucking amateurs.

31:38.777 --> 31:41.379
Yeah, how?
Only the four of us knew.

31:41.480 --> 31:44.449
Well, no one here
leaked anything, right?

31:44.550 --> 31:48.419
- Could you have been hacked?
- First of all, fuck you.

31:48.521 --> 31:52.357
Second of all, I ain't the one
shaking off 15 years of mommy rust.

31:52.458 --> 31:55.860
Okay, I'm out of here. Call me
when you've got my cut ready.

31:55.961 --> 31:58.362
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
- What?!

31:58.463 --> 31:59.730
What are you so pissed about?

31:59.831 --> 32:02.299
I should have my head examined
for doing this with you.

32:02.400 --> 32:04.902
<i>Hey, you came to me.
Don't forget that.</i>

32:05.003 --> 32:07.905
- We had this planned without you.
- And who would have done the driving?

32:08.006 --> 32:09.674
- Come on, Ana.
- That's not my name.

32:09.775 --> 32:11.275
- It's who you are.
- No, that's who you want me to be!

32:11.376 --> 32:13.877
If that's true, then
why did you want in?

32:16.147 --> 32:19.849
I got fired, okay?
By my best friend.

32:19.950 --> 32:21.685
And no one else is going to hire me,

32:21.786 --> 32:23.787
especially if I get brought
up on criminal charges,

32:23.888 --> 32:26.423
which seems to be what
Racine is aiming for.

32:29.426 --> 32:34.297
I'm broke. So this is pretty
much the only gig I've got.

32:40.805 --> 32:43.073
I think now might be a
good time to remind you

32:43.174 --> 32:45.174
we need to get the
fuck out of this town.

32:45.275 --> 32:48.033
- Not yet.
- Come on, man.

32:48.068 --> 32:50.112
We came, we saw, we
got our asses whupped.

32:50.214 --> 32:53.449
And if Rabbit is still out there,
that's just one more reason to get gone.

32:53.550 --> 32:56.452
We risking our necks out
here for chump change.

32:56.553 --> 33:01.356
We're still good.
Still got those diamonds, right?

33:02.358 --> 33:03.892
Fuck me.

33:06.562 --> 33:09.798
Look, every day, you find a new way

33:09.899 --> 33:13.168
to get your damn head blown
off and mine along with it.

33:13.269 --> 33:16.538
Those diamonds are an insurance
policy for the both of us.

33:16.639 --> 33:18.840
- I was keeping them safe.
- I know.

33:20.876 --> 33:23.144
I would never cut you out.

33:24.247 --> 33:26.147
I know.

33:30.219 --> 33:32.019
So let's get the fuck out of here.

33:32.121 --> 33:34.222
We can fence the stones
and set up shop in New York

33:34.322 --> 33:37.959
- or anywhere else you want.
- Not yet.

33:39.728 --> 33:43.164
For fuck's sake, what the
hell is keeping you here, man?

33:46.135 --> 33:48.569
Here's how this works.
You either give me your names

33:48.670 --> 33:51.639
so that I can call your parents
or I have to involve the police.

33:51.740 --> 33:54.174
And I'm telling you it was a
mistake. I meant to pay for them.

33:54.276 --> 33:56.243
<i>And I'm sure your
parents will believe you.</i>

33:56.344 --> 33:59.780
I'm trying to cut you a break
here by not calling the police.

33:59.881 --> 34:02.082
- Call them.
- Okay.

34:02.183 --> 34:05.436
And as soon as they get here,
I'll tell them how you groped me

34:05.437 --> 34:08.454
- when you were taking us back here.
- Don't be ridiculous.

34:08.554 --> 34:10.623
He said he had to search me.

34:12.493 --> 34:17.297
And then... he started, like...
rubbing my breasts.

34:18.364 --> 34:21.134
- I was so scared.
- Deva.

34:21.235 --> 34:23.034
And you'll tell them it never happened.

34:23.136 --> 34:26.105
And I am sure
your wife will believe you.

34:26.206 --> 34:30.677
So, William... can I call you William?
What's it gonna be?

34:34.181 --> 34:37.081
Keep up the good work, William.
Come on, Beats.

34:39.719 --> 34:41.420
<i>They knew what they were doing.</i>

34:41.521 --> 34:42.955
<i>Ever since they built
that new connector,</i>

34:43.056 --> 34:44.924
<i>barely anyone uses that highway anymore.</i>

34:45.025 --> 34:46.158
Least that much makes sense.

34:46.259 --> 34:50.963
So someone else ran them off the road
and they left all the cash behind?

34:51.063 --> 34:53.764
- Not all of it.
- Someone got away with one bag.

34:53.867 --> 34:57.803
100,000 and change. Either the
thieves or whoever ran them down.

34:57.903 --> 35:01.072
Yeah, but you got off light considering.

35:02.342 --> 35:06.812
- Any idea who the shooter was?
- Can't help you there.

35:06.912 --> 35:10.816
This fake guard,
you catch any security video

35:10.916 --> 35:12.350
<i>of him loading the truck this morning?</i>

35:12.451 --> 35:14.152
<i>The server went down this morning.</i>

35:14.253 --> 35:16.821
<i>So did our backup.
Some kind of virus.</i>

35:16.922 --> 35:19.623
<i>We lost the last 24 hours of footage.</i>

35:19.725 --> 35:23.828
Huh. And the missing cash,
any way to trace that?

35:23.929 --> 35:27.765
- Serial numbers? Markers?
- It's unbanked cash from the tables.

35:27.867 --> 35:30.934
<i>Yesterday it was in someone's pocket.</i>

35:31.035 --> 35:33.771
Yeah, I figured as much.

35:35.807 --> 35:37.675
<i>There are some on the reservation</i>

35:37.776 --> 35:40.478
<i>who would consider $150,000 quite a bit.</i>

35:40.579 --> 35:44.181
<i>For a fortune, actually.
It is troubling,</i>

35:44.282 --> 35:46.950
this coming so soon after
the setback with the hotel.

35:47.051 --> 35:51.989
<i>Whether this was Proctor or not,
the fact remains that the Kinaho Moon</i>

35:52.090 --> 35:55.592
- is having some serious problems.
- George, we've been through this.

35:55.693 --> 35:58.595
This entire renovation and expansion

35:58.696 --> 36:02.565
was designed to be serviced by
that hotel, which is now rubble.

36:02.666 --> 36:05.802
I take it your insurance didn't
cover unexplained explosions.

36:05.903 --> 36:09.171
You've been opposed to the
hotel project from the start.

36:09.273 --> 36:13.543
- My father...
- Your father was a great man

36:13.644 --> 36:16.713
<i>who lost his way when he became ill.</i>

36:16.814 --> 36:18.514
Even you have to concede

36:18.615 --> 36:21.417
that since you've become chief,
our fortunes have suffered.

36:21.518 --> 36:23.819
And the tribe simply can't afford it.

36:23.921 --> 36:27.356
The sooner you say what you came
to say, the sooner you can leave.

36:27.457 --> 36:29.491
You're out of your depth, Alex.

36:29.592 --> 36:32.361
And the members of the tribal
council have serious concerns

36:32.462 --> 36:34.163
about your qualifications.

36:34.264 --> 36:39.167
You've always wanted this seat, George.
Everybody knows that.

36:40.637 --> 36:44.272
And everybody knows
that you're too young for it.

36:50.980 --> 36:52.080
Nola.

36:56.485 --> 36:58.453
I know.

37:00.856 --> 37:02.657
<i>And they use special effects for it.</i>

37:02.758 --> 37:04.859
But you can tell because
his hair is barely moving.

37:04.961 --> 37:06.044
- Right.
- And if he was really flying,

37:06.045 --> 37:08.863
his hair would be, like, you know,
flying around his face and everything.

37:08.964 --> 37:12.199
Yeah, you are totally right.

37:13.802 --> 37:15.402
<i>You okay?</i>

37:15.504 --> 37:19.239
- Hey, where's your inhaler?
- I got it.

37:22.611 --> 37:25.112
<i>Here. Here, bud.</i>

37:25.213 --> 37:27.214
<i>Deep breaths.</i>

37:45.500 --> 37:47.901
- You shouldn't be here.
- This is my home.

37:48.002 --> 37:51.505
Look, your case is going to the
grand jury. I'm the district attorney.

37:51.606 --> 37:53.406
Are you really gonna let them charge me?

37:54.542 --> 37:58.611
Racine wants a scapegoat.
I have no choice but to recuse myself.

37:58.712 --> 37:59.979
There's nothing I can do.

38:00.014 --> 38:03.316
- The assistant district attorney...
- Bullshit. She works for you!

38:03.417 --> 38:07.020
I'm sorry. Are you innocent?
Is that what you're telling me?

38:07.121 --> 38:10.823
- I hurt you. I know that.
- No, Carrie. Not me, all of us.

38:10.924 --> 38:14.484
Max, Deva. And you didn't hurt us.
You destroyed our family.

38:14.519 --> 38:16.695
You scarred your kids.
And they will not heal.

38:16.796 --> 38:19.297
And sending their mother to
prison, that's going to help?

38:19.399 --> 38:21.600
Well, their mother
almost got them killed.

38:26.239 --> 38:28.540
I'm drowning here, Gordon.

38:29.442 --> 38:32.376
Yeah, well, join the fucking club.

38:35.448 --> 38:38.150
<i> That's the last of it.</i>

38:40.753 --> 38:43.055
Thanks.

38:43.156 --> 38:45.390
New beginnings.

38:47.426 --> 38:52.163
- It's just temporary.
- I know.

38:52.264 --> 38:54.766
So, we're back in business.

38:55.968 --> 38:57.334
Yeah.

38:57.436 --> 38:59.737
Kind of hard to believe
we got off so light, huh?

38:59.838 --> 39:02.707
Yeah, Racine's not interested in us.

39:04.042 --> 39:05.976
It's Rabbit he wants.

39:06.078 --> 39:10.013
You really think Gordon's gonna
let Carrie go down for this?

39:12.184 --> 39:14.518
Racine's pulling all the strings.

39:17.655 --> 39:23.159
He's just playing every angle.
Trying to flush out Rabbit.

39:31.568 --> 39:33.268
Can I ask you something?

39:33.369 --> 39:35.137
- Off the record.
- Sure.

39:36.673 --> 39:38.641
You and Carrie Hopewell.

39:40.110 --> 39:44.045
- What?
- I don't know. You tell me.

39:45.781 --> 39:47.716
There's nothing to tell.

39:47.817 --> 39:52.187
I got in over my head.
That's all.

39:53.523 --> 39:55.524
So there's nothing
between the two of you?

39:55.625 --> 40:00.695
No. I should probably go.
Let you get settled.

40:00.796 --> 40:04.432
- You've got secrets, boss.
- Don't we all?

40:04.533 --> 40:06.367
I'm just saying...

40:07.903 --> 40:10.705
<i>if they ever get to be too
much or if you want to talk...</i>

40:10.806 --> 40:12.306
<i>All right.</i>

40:14.744 --> 40:18.947
What you did,
coming to check up on me

40:18.948 --> 40:23.884
every day these past
few weeks, that, uh...

40:25.287 --> 40:27.188
<i>that was a big help.</i>

40:29.891 --> 40:34.628
Good. I'm just glad
you're back on your feet.

40:34.729 --> 40:36.697
Yeah.

40:46.340 --> 40:49.842
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

40:59.753 --> 41:02.589
<i> It's hard to know what
to say at a time like this.</i>

41:03.891 --> 41:06.793
<i>You know, Banshee's a
town like any other town.</i>

41:06.894 --> 41:10.596
<i>And like any other town,
we have our darkness.</i>

41:12.132 --> 41:13.933
<i>Our secrets.</i>

41:20.808 --> 41:23.342
<i>Danny was too young to be Mayor</i>

41:23.443 --> 41:26.011
<i>and he was definitely too young to die.</i>

41:27.581 --> 41:32.218
<i>But something in him compelled him
to fight for goodness and justice.</i>

41:33.886 --> 41:36.955
<i>He was young enough
or maybe naive enough</i>

41:37.056 --> 41:39.858
<i>to think that
he could help to build us</i>

41:39.959 --> 41:42.293
<i>something better than we had,</i>

41:42.394 --> 41:45.731
<i>something better than
maybe some of us deserved.</i>

41:49.602 --> 41:51.937
<i>He hadn't seen enough yet to know fear.</i>

41:55.307 --> 41:56.974
<i>Or regret.</i>

42:03.014 --> 42:05.450
<i>Or the relentless nature of evil.</i>

42:13.725 --> 42:17.094
<i>And the truth is, we should
have had this service weeks ago,</i>

42:17.195 --> 42:20.765
<i>but Dan's the one who always
arranged these kind of events.</i>

42:20.866 --> 42:23.533
<i>We're all just playing catch-up now,</i>

42:23.635 --> 42:26.436
trying to fill the void he left.

42:28.373 --> 42:31.541
<i>Janie, on behalf of myself,</i>

42:31.643 --> 42:33.777
<i>my office, and all of Banshee,</i>

42:33.878 --> 42:36.045
we mourn his loss with you.

42:44.121 --> 42:47.757
<i>So, back to
business as usual, huh?</i>

42:51.561 --> 42:56.166
Yeah.
Whatever that is.

42:56.267 --> 42:58.201
<i>You know, Job may have a point.</i>

42:58.302 --> 43:02.204
Do you ever stop to wonder
if you be pushing your luck?

43:02.306 --> 43:06.241
Maybe it's time for you to
take your show on the road.

43:07.711 --> 43:12.014
Look here, even at 20
cents on the dollar,

43:12.115 --> 43:14.049
those diamonds are more than enough

43:14.150 --> 43:16.919
to get you set up anywhere you choose.

43:17.020 --> 43:20.122
- Trying to get rid of me?
- Yeah, maybe I am.

43:20.223 --> 43:24.793
For your own good.
Come on, man.

43:24.894 --> 43:28.563
You've taken this sheriff thing
about as far as it should have gone.

43:28.664 --> 43:31.867
Sooner or later, someone's
gonna figure out who you are.

43:31.968 --> 43:35.537
Or at least who you are... not.

43:37.606 --> 43:39.974
The thing is...

43:42.077 --> 43:44.378
she's all I had.

43:45.848 --> 43:47.749
I leave here...

43:49.552 --> 43:52.553
I don't know, I feel like
I'll disappear or something.

43:52.654 --> 43:57.058
You start over. It's what you
do after a stretch like yours.

43:57.159 --> 43:59.293
- Not that simple.
- Maybe.

43:59.394 --> 44:03.231
Maybe you just don't know
simple when you see it.

44:05.767 --> 44:08.301
<i>Seat taken?</i>

44:08.403 --> 44:10.237
No, it's all yours.

44:10.338 --> 44:12.272
<i>Haven't seen you before.</i>

44:12.374 --> 44:15.175
<i>- You from around here?
- I don't get out much.</i>

44:15.276 --> 44:19.513
- You got Chivas 25?
- Sure do.

44:19.614 --> 44:21.614
<i>Rough day?</i>

44:23.385 --> 44:25.518
I've had better.

44:33.160 --> 44:34.660
You live around here?

44:37.731 --> 44:42.334
Uh...
about 40 yards away.

44:42.436 --> 44:44.670
Well, that's convenient.

44:44.772 --> 44:47.573
You wouldn't say that
if you'd seen the place.

44:49.075 --> 44:52.381
Well, then let's go see the place.

46:11.722 --> 46:15.916
<i>Agent Racine.
Back again so soon?</i>

46:16.560 --> 46:18.862
I have a lot of sins.

46:20.163 --> 46:22.999
Your visits are becoming tiresome.

46:24.067 --> 46:27.904
I thought you enjoyed our repartee.

46:29.106 --> 46:34.811
As I get older, I find there are
far fewer things that I enjoy.

46:34.912 --> 46:37.346
Jesus Christ, Father.
You're in a hell of a mood.

46:37.447 --> 46:41.017
My brother is dead. I am
waiting for you to find his body.

46:41.118 --> 46:45.954
<i>I fully expect to find his body
eating and shitting</i>

46:46.056 --> 46:48.924
<i>and recovering from two bullet wounds.</i>

46:49.026 --> 46:51.494
This obsession of
yours, it cannot be good

46:51.594 --> 46:54.429
for your already fragile health.

46:54.531 --> 46:56.932
<i>You can't kill a dead man.</i>

46:57.033 --> 47:00.802
Death is not the worst thing
that can happen to a man.

47:02.338 --> 47:05.040
I don't know how you can
call yourself a man of God

47:05.141 --> 47:07.643
when you hide that evil son of a bitch.

47:07.744 --> 47:11.156
I have seen pain and suffering
you would not believe.

47:12.915 --> 47:15.950
And I have found God
in corners of the world

47:16.052 --> 47:19.154
in which you wouldn't
stoop to take a piss.

47:19.255 --> 47:21.756
<i>So don't come into my church</i>

47:21.857 --> 47:24.959

they're just words.

47:29.798 --> 47:33.500
Words made up by small frightened men

47:37.606 --> 47:41.975
<i>the chaos and the darkness

Good talk.

47:54.189 --> 47:57.191

<i>You hear me?!</i>

48:10.104 --> 48:12.472
