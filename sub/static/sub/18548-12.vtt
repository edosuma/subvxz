00:01.200 --> 00:04.070
You have been listening to Up To You,

00:04.120 --> 00:06.710
with Barney Butterfield
asking the questions,

00:06.760 --> 00:09.270
and Joyce Merriman tickling the ivories.

00:09.320 --> 00:14.110
The announcer was Richie Queenan,
and the producer is Harold James.

00:14.160 --> 00:17.390
♪ Thank you all for
tuning in to Up To You! ♪

00:17.440 --> 00:20.670
Ta-ra, folks, thanks for
coming, thanks for listening,

00:20.720 --> 00:22.310
hope you can join us next week!

00:22.360 --> 00:24.310
But at the end of the
day, remember, it's...

00:24.360 --> 00:26.470
Up to you!

00:30.160 --> 00:32.759
This is the BBC Light Programme.

00:33.520 --> 00:35.910
By 'eck, where do we get
these audiences from?

00:35.960 --> 00:37.910
I've had more laughs in a mausoleum.

00:37.960 --> 00:40.350
Well, they did seem to
warm up towards the end.

00:40.400 --> 00:43.310
Yes, by the final round,
they were practically tepid.

00:43.360 --> 00:45.510
Ay-up, Jacob!

00:45.560 --> 00:48.510
Do you fancy a quick pork pie and
a pint at the Pig and Whistle?

00:48.560 --> 00:51.670
No, thank you. I've come to
introduce your new producer.

00:51.720 --> 00:53.270
What?!

00:53.320 --> 00:55.270
As Harold is back at the sanatorium.

00:55.320 --> 00:56.670
Oh, how exciting!

00:56.720 --> 00:58.790
I always love it when we get a new man.

00:58.840 --> 01:00.470
Someone to take under
our wing, as it were.

01:00.520 --> 01:02.390
If you'd like to come through.

01:02.440 --> 01:06.550
Ah, hello. M-my name is Juh-Juh-Jeremy.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.470
Is the "Juh-Juh" part of it?

01:08.520 --> 01:09.630
N-n-no.

01:09.680 --> 01:11.590
Jeremy's been working in current affairs,

01:11.640 --> 01:14.270
but he's got some marvellous
ideas for the new series.

01:14.320 --> 01:17.630
W-w-well, I thought we could
take the show on the road.

01:17.680 --> 01:20.390
Wouldn't it be wonderful to
have a quiz show that went down

01:20.440 --> 01:23.270
the highways and byways, shining
a light on our sceptred isle?

01:23.320 --> 01:25.550
- No, it wouldn't.
- Sorry?

01:25.600 --> 01:27.790
I spent six years in variety,

01:27.840 --> 01:30.750
staying in boarding houses
that stunk of cabbage.

01:30.800 --> 01:34.030
But I'm a big star now, so
the folk come to see me.

01:34.080 --> 01:38.950
Y-yes, yes, but this is the
BBC, we have to reach out.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.590
Nation shall speak peace unto nation.

01:41.640 --> 01:43.510
Oh, yeah. Well, I'll speak to 'em,

01:43.560 --> 01:45.710
but I'm not going any
further than Muswell Hill.

01:45.760 --> 01:48.830
Barney, this is not a
request. It's an edict.

01:48.880 --> 01:51.750
The show either has to evolve, or die.

01:53.160 --> 01:54.870
Fine!

01:54.920 --> 01:56.630
Then it should die!

01:56.680 --> 01:59.680
And without me, the BBC is going to die!

02:01.080 --> 02:03.750
And you're the one that killed it.

02:07.080 --> 02:08.389
Oh!

02:08.440 --> 02:11.540
Look, it's really not
that bad. It's not...

02:13.240 --> 02:15.510
Welcome to show business!

02:52.120 --> 02:53.670
Mrs McCarthy.

02:53.720 --> 02:56.910
I was hoping to have a word about
next week's confirmation class.

02:56.960 --> 02:59.670
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm on
a very tight schedule.

02:59.720 --> 03:02.390
I thought you said you had a day
off. Something about jam-making.

03:02.440 --> 03:04.510
Yes, well, change of plan.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.510
Actually, I'm seeing a gentleman

03:06.560 --> 03:09.110
from the British Broadcasting Corporation.

03:09.160 --> 03:12.430
Would that have anything to do
with the quiz coming to Kembleford?

03:12.480 --> 03:14.350
Yes, it would.

03:14.400 --> 03:19.110
They're conducting some heats in the
village hall to find contestants.

03:19.160 --> 03:20.680
Well...

03:22.400 --> 03:26.200
I shall be very glad to
give you some moral support.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.150
Excellent!

03:28.200 --> 03:30.270
- Morning!
- Morning.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.750
Good morning.

03:35.440 --> 03:38.390
Holy Mother! I had no idea
there would be so many.

03:38.440 --> 03:42.150
I imagine they all read
it in the parish magazine.

03:42.200 --> 03:47.630
Although I was surprised you put
it on page six, in such small print.

03:47.680 --> 03:50.070
Yes, well, I didn't think
there'd be much interest.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.190
But I stand corrected.

03:53.360 --> 03:54.760
Morning.

04:00.080 --> 04:01.550
Mrs Rudge.

04:02.640 --> 04:04.030
Are you here for the quiz?

04:04.080 --> 04:05.590
That's right.

04:05.640 --> 04:08.470
I've got them all staying
at my boarding house.

04:08.520 --> 04:10.830
That Barney Butterfield.

04:10.880 --> 04:13.590
Though he's about as
funny as a kidney stone,

04:13.640 --> 04:15.390
if you want my opinion.

04:15.440 --> 04:17.630
And her that plays the piano...

04:17.680 --> 04:21.709
Well, she thumps on it,
with her fat fingers. Ha!

04:21.760 --> 04:24.030
Somebody's brought a lot of sandwiches.

04:24.080 --> 04:25.870
My cat's just had a litter.

04:25.920 --> 04:28.030
I won't be able to look after them all,

04:28.080 --> 04:30.670
so I thought, "I'll bring 'em
along, see if I can sell 'em."

04:30.720 --> 04:33.910
- Yes, well, unfortunately,
I'm allergic. - Ah.

04:33.960 --> 04:36.270
Mrs M! Father!

04:36.320 --> 04:38.590
Oh, kitties!

04:38.640 --> 04:41.390
Careful! They're worth a lot of money.

04:41.440 --> 04:44.150
What are you doing here?
Are you thinking of...?

04:44.200 --> 04:46.830
Oh, yes, I've applied to be a contestant.

04:46.880 --> 04:48.710
Oh, well, good luck with that.

04:48.760 --> 04:50.590
What do you mean?

04:50.640 --> 04:53.310
I think if you want to win a BBC quiz,

04:53.360 --> 04:57.150
you need to know that Karl Marx
is no relation of Groucho's.

04:57.200 --> 04:59.230
I know more than you think.

04:59.280 --> 05:01.350
Don't I, little kitty?

05:05.760 --> 05:08.670
Ah, well, it's good to see so many of you.

05:08.720 --> 05:11.790
Um... We're now going to whittle
you down to just two people,

05:11.840 --> 05:15.190
who'll play the show
for real o-o-on Sunday.

05:15.240 --> 05:16.590
So, er, come this way.

05:16.640 --> 05:18.640
That's half a crown.

05:22.040 --> 05:25.430
♪ Up to you! Up to you!

05:25.480 --> 05:27.110
♪ Are you going to win tonight?

05:27.160 --> 05:29.200
♪ It's up to you! ♪

05:30.480 --> 05:33.230
Thank you very much, Joyce.
Very nice, thank you very much.

05:33.280 --> 05:36.590
And this section of the programme
is called "Where In The World?".

05:36.640 --> 05:38.550
So, Sergeant Goodfellow.

05:38.600 --> 05:39.790
Yes.

05:39.840 --> 05:43.340
Where in the world would
you find Lake Titicaca?

05:45.160 --> 05:47.400
Titi... Titi...

05:50.800 --> 05:53.870
- It's on the tip of my tongue.
- I don't think it is, you know!

05:55.600 --> 05:57.400
Is it in Africa?

05:57.870 --> 05:58.870
I'm afraid not.

05:58.920 --> 06:01.350
Let's hope they don't send
you there on a case, Sergeant.

06:01.400 --> 06:03.350
No, it's in South America.

06:03.400 --> 06:05.630
So, Mrs McCarthy.

06:05.680 --> 06:07.070
Oh, yes. Hello.

06:07.120 --> 06:10.990
Hello. Where in the world would
you find Macgillycuddy's Reeks?

06:11.040 --> 06:13.270
County... Oh, sorry.

06:13.320 --> 06:16.430
County Kerry, near Killarney,
on the west coast of Ireland.

06:18.320 --> 06:19.470
Correct!

06:19.520 --> 06:21.310
And your Irish eyes may be smiling,

06:21.360 --> 06:24.860
because you could be going
through to the final.

06:24.920 --> 06:26.720
Miss Windermere?

06:27.320 --> 06:28.710
Yes.

06:28.760 --> 06:32.590
Where would I find the
world-famous Segantini Museum?

06:35.200 --> 06:37.350
St Moritz, Switzerland.

06:37.900 --> 06:40.430
Well done, have you been?

06:40.480 --> 06:43.630
Oh, no, not inside it,
although I have skied past it.

06:43.680 --> 06:45.790
Well, you might be skiing
right into our final.

06:45.840 --> 06:50.390
Let's just hope that you don't
meet an avalanche along the way.

06:50.440 --> 06:51.790
Now, then, Mrs Rudge.

06:51.840 --> 06:53.710
What?

06:53.760 --> 06:56.950
Mrs Rudge. Where in the world
would you find Tutankhamen?

06:57.000 --> 06:58.590
I know that!

06:58.640 --> 07:00.310
It's in Egypt.

07:01.240 --> 07:02.910
I'm afraid not, it's in South London.

07:02.960 --> 07:05.630
Tooting Common -- it's near Balham.

07:06.280 --> 07:08.830
You did not say Tooting Common,

07:08.880 --> 07:10.910
you said Tutankhamen!

07:10.960 --> 07:12.750
I know what I said, Mrs Rudge.

07:12.800 --> 07:17.100
Maybe we could get you an 'earing
aid as a consolation, eh?

07:18.480 --> 07:21.550
Gosh. Should I step in?

07:21.600 --> 07:23.070
Don't you dare.

07:23.120 --> 07:26.510
We always pull out the old
Tutankhamen stunt when there's

07:26.560 --> 07:29.150
a dreary contestant we want to get rid of.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.270
What?!

07:30.320 --> 07:33.750
Well, I'm fed up staying
in her dingy boarding house

07:33.800 --> 07:38.030
with cold showers, disgusting
food and a faint smell of pussy.

07:38.080 --> 07:41.670
But this is the BBC.
What about our integrity?

07:41.720 --> 07:44.550
This show gets 15 million listeners.

07:44.600 --> 07:47.070
They really don't tune
in for the integrity.

07:47.120 --> 07:49.910
I can't keep asking you
questions till you get one right!

07:49.960 --> 07:52.560
It's not fair. You talk too fast.

07:53.480 --> 07:55.430
Well, we can't all be winners, can we?

07:55.480 --> 07:57.710
So, please can we have a nice
big round of applause for

07:57.760 --> 08:00.430
Sergeant Goodfellow and Mrs Rudge?

08:02.760 --> 08:05.590
You can clap all you
like, the show's a fix.

08:05.640 --> 08:08.950
Richie, what are the scores, then? Richie?

08:09.000 --> 08:10.870
At the end of that exciting heat,

08:10.920 --> 08:15.750
we say a sad toodle-oo to
Sergeant Goodfellow and Mrs Rudge,

08:15.800 --> 08:21.590
but a big here-we-go to Miss
Windermere and Mrs McCarthy.

08:21.640 --> 08:22.910
Ladies?

08:22.960 --> 08:25.750
Which means the ladies
will be appearing here,

08:25.800 --> 08:28.600
live to the nation, on Sunday night!

08:40.840 --> 08:43.309
I also misheard your question.

08:44.960 --> 08:47.070
Would you like me to have a word?

08:47.120 --> 08:49.710
I can fight my own battles, thank you.

08:49.760 --> 08:53.070
What goes around comes around.

08:55.080 --> 08:56.920
So, um...

08:57.960 --> 08:59.430
- Bunty.
- Bunty, yes.

08:59.480 --> 09:02.230
You were so... confident.
I don't know how you do it.

09:02.280 --> 09:06.390
Oh, I just open my mouth
and see what comes out.

09:06.440 --> 09:07.550
Gosh.

09:07.600 --> 09:10.830
Erm, well, I'm new to the area.

09:10.880 --> 09:13.880
I was hoping someone could show me around.

09:14.440 --> 09:16.180
Yes, of course.

09:17.720 --> 09:20.550
Is anybody doing anything
nice this evening?

09:20.600 --> 09:23.190
I shall go in search of debauchery.

09:23.240 --> 09:25.640
I may be gone for some time.

09:25.960 --> 09:28.390
I'm m-m-meeting a girl.

09:28.440 --> 09:30.510
Is she f-f-female?

09:30.560 --> 09:33.710
Pay no attention. You run
along and meet your female.

09:33.760 --> 09:36.510
I'm sure you'll get on
like a house on fire.

09:36.560 --> 09:38.990
Right, then, I'm off to bell-ringing.

09:39.040 --> 09:42.030
I've lit the fire so
you won't be too nippy.

09:42.080 --> 09:44.350
And I've locked them
kittens in the back room,

09:44.400 --> 09:46.950
so they won't be under your feet.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.630
Are you not eating?
Well, I don't blame you.

09:50.680 --> 09:54.150
Them ballgowns you wear
show every little detail.

09:54.200 --> 09:56.350
And you want to do
something with your hair

09:56.400 --> 09:57.950
if you're meeting a lady friend.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.740
Mind you, at least you've got some.

10:02.720 --> 10:06.470
Oh, and I found your
diary. Very entertaining.

10:06.520 --> 10:07.870
Where did you find...?

10:07.920 --> 10:09.230
It were under your pillow.

10:09.280 --> 10:12.270
You really should keep it better hidden.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.550
Some of the muck in there... Gah!

10:15.600 --> 10:18.200
Have a lovely evening, everyone.

10:19.480 --> 10:21.350
What a woman, eh?

10:22.800 --> 10:25.200
I'd give her a dirty look...

10:25.760 --> 10:28.160
.. but she's already got one.

10:29.040 --> 10:31.950
Y-yes, she's driving
us all round the bend.

10:32.000 --> 10:35.630
Well, if it's that bad, you could
always come and stay chez moi.

10:35.680 --> 10:36.750
What?

10:36.800 --> 10:39.510
Oh... no, no, I have to stay with my cast.

10:39.560 --> 10:42.190
Oh, well, they could all come.
There's masses of space.

10:42.240 --> 10:44.990
Well, erm, th-that would be wonderful.

10:45.040 --> 10:49.750
J-Joyce! Erm, Bunty has asked
if we'll come and stay with her.

10:49.800 --> 10:52.950
Oh, that's nice. Erm,
have you seen Barney?

10:53.000 --> 10:55.150
We were meant to meet here at half past.

10:55.200 --> 10:56.870
No, he's not been here at all.

10:56.920 --> 10:58.110
Oh, dear.

10:58.160 --> 11:00.550
Oh, I hope nothing's happened to him.

11:00.600 --> 11:03.150
Well, we were just about
to go for a walk --

11:03.200 --> 11:06.360
- we could always keep an eye out for him.
- Oh, thank you.

11:13.320 --> 11:15.830
You're so lucky to live here.

11:15.880 --> 11:18.590
Really? I'd give my eye
teeth to go back to London.

11:18.640 --> 11:23.150
I just think here you can step
out onto the open road, and...

11:23.200 --> 11:25.280
Oh! Oh, dear.

11:26.280 --> 11:27.590
Do you smell something?

11:27.640 --> 11:30.070
- Yes, very sorry, it's....
- No, look.

11:30.120 --> 11:32.510
Isn't that your guest house?

11:32.560 --> 11:34.630
OK, is anyone at home?

11:35.400 --> 11:37.870
No, I think they're all... The kittens!

11:37.920 --> 11:39.390
Right, I'm going in.

11:39.440 --> 11:41.110
No! I know where they are.

11:41.160 --> 11:43.160
You go and get help.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.000
I need the fire brigade.

12:03.920 --> 12:05.390
What is it?

12:05.440 --> 12:07.630
Mrs Rudge.

12:07.680 --> 12:09.230
She's dead.

12:14.800 --> 12:18.360
Requiescat in pace. Amen.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.030
Who found the body?

12:32.080 --> 12:35.150
Jeremy. He's at the hospital now.

12:35.200 --> 12:38.280
He was coughing so much he
was practically inside out.

12:39.600 --> 12:43.630
I just don't understand.
He said the house was empty.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.030
It should have been.

12:45.080 --> 12:46.830
Mrs Rudge was at bell-ringing practice,

12:46.880 --> 12:49.870
but she came back early,
worried about her kittens.

12:49.920 --> 12:51.190
The kittens!

12:51.240 --> 12:52.400
Oh!

12:54.280 --> 12:55.550
Where have you been?

12:55.600 --> 12:56.870
It's none of your beeswax.

12:56.920 --> 12:58.830
I was worried sick!

12:58.880 --> 13:01.670
I'm sure you were. I'm your meal ticket.

13:01.720 --> 13:04.360
No, it's not like that, I...

13:05.640 --> 13:07.670
Everywhere I go, autograph hunters.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.190
No, I think it's more serious than that.

13:10.240 --> 13:13.270
All right, everyone,
there's nothing to see.

13:13.320 --> 13:16.430
What happened here is a tragic accident.

13:16.480 --> 13:18.950
What DID happen here?

13:19.000 --> 13:22.830
Mrs Rudge died from smoke inhalation
caused by a blocked chimney.

13:22.880 --> 13:24.790
How can you be sure?

13:24.840 --> 13:28.310
Because, Padre, I've looked,
and it was definitely blocked.

13:28.360 --> 13:29.870
It's a common enough problem,

13:29.920 --> 13:34.670
which is why my wife and I
recently converted to the electric.

13:34.720 --> 13:37.230
Now, if you were staying
at the boarding house,

13:37.280 --> 13:38.910
your possessions will be sent on,

13:38.960 --> 13:41.310
but for now we need to clear the area.

13:41.360 --> 13:42.960
(Oh, God...)

13:45.400 --> 13:47.470
What are you thinking?

13:50.800 --> 13:55.270
I'm thinking that Mrs Rudge was
on the cleaning rota for St Mary's

13:55.320 --> 13:58.830
and when she polished the brasses,
you could see your face in them.

13:58.880 --> 14:02.160
If her chimney was blocked,
she would have known about it.

14:04.240 --> 14:06.180
- Penelope?
- Yes.

14:06.920 --> 14:10.680
Do you think you could get through
a window at the back of the house?

14:26.640 --> 14:28.430
So, how did the kittens survive?

14:28.480 --> 14:31.350
Well, they must have been in a safe place.

14:31.400 --> 14:34.160
Or perhaps they do have nine lives.

14:39.720 --> 14:43.220
Anyway, why would anyone
want to kill Mrs Rudge?

14:44.160 --> 14:48.360
Landladies, like priests, often
know more than is good for them.

14:52.040 --> 14:53.190
Now...

14:53.240 --> 14:55.780
If only we had a chimney sweep.

14:58.080 --> 14:59.550
Oh, you have got to be...

14:59.600 --> 15:02.310
What an awful thing to happen.

15:02.360 --> 15:05.230
I know, you just get settled in a
place and you have to up sticks.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.950
Drinkiepoos?

15:07.000 --> 15:10.230
Richie, you haven't actually put
your hand in your pocket, have you?

15:10.280 --> 15:14.110
I just thought, with
Mrs Whatserchops dying,

15:14.160 --> 15:17.590
life is short, so we
may as well get sloshed.

15:17.640 --> 15:20.630
- Do they know for sure what happened?
- I don't know.

15:20.680 --> 15:24.030
Maybe someone told her to act
her age, and so she died.

15:24.080 --> 15:26.870
Oh, for heaven's sake!
How can you be so cruel?

15:26.920 --> 15:28.470
It's a gift.

15:28.520 --> 15:32.790
I just have this extraordinary
talent to derive pleasure

15:32.840 --> 15:36.140
- from the sufferings
of other people. - You.

15:36.760 --> 15:38.910
You've got absolutely
no talent whatsoever.

15:38.960 --> 15:40.950
You're just a jumped-up,
clapped-out has-been

15:41.000 --> 15:42.670
who's clinging onto my coat-tails.

15:42.720 --> 15:46.920
Actually, my star is very
much in the ascendant.

15:47.920 --> 15:50.060
Prepare to be eclipsed.

15:55.520 --> 15:58.320
Try not to get any soot in your eyes.

16:01.800 --> 16:03.710
There's something up there!

16:03.760 --> 16:05.030
What?

16:12.040 --> 16:13.230
Interesting.

16:13.280 --> 16:15.670
In what sense?

16:15.720 --> 16:18.590
It's a metal grille,
filled with wax and gravel.

16:18.640 --> 16:21.040
But how did it get up there?

16:22.960 --> 16:25.750
I think that earlier today

16:25.800 --> 16:30.510
someone smeared the sides of
the flue with wax and gravel

16:30.560 --> 16:33.830
and then positioned the
grille inside the chimney.

16:33.880 --> 16:36.110
And then, when the fire was lit,

16:36.160 --> 16:38.070
the smoke passed through as normal,

16:38.120 --> 16:40.230
but then as the fire got hotter

16:40.280 --> 16:42.070
the wax and gravel melted,

16:42.120 --> 16:46.240
and dropped down to block
the holes in the grille.

16:50.640 --> 16:54.040
Turning this house into a smoke bomb.

16:58.360 --> 17:01.790
I've invited the cast to come
and stay with me at Montague.

17:01.840 --> 17:04.150
Then you need to be very careful,

17:04.200 --> 17:06.800
because one of them is a killer.

17:09.960 --> 17:11.869
Th-th-this is so kind of you.

17:11.920 --> 17:15.230
I was all ready to snuggle
up at the Seamen's Mission.

17:15.280 --> 17:18.589
Still, there's always tomorrow.

17:18.640 --> 17:20.109
Excuse me, love.

17:20.160 --> 17:21.430
Yes?

17:21.480 --> 17:23.550
How much would a place
like this cost to buy?

17:23.599 --> 17:25.109
What?

17:25.160 --> 17:28.280
To the nearest hundred. I mean,
I'm not short of a shilling.

17:29.560 --> 17:32.160
I think you have to be born here.

17:32.400 --> 17:33.670
There you all are.

17:33.720 --> 17:37.710
Before you get too settled, I
need to ask you some questions.

17:37.760 --> 17:40.630
'In the book by Beatrix Potter,

17:40.680 --> 17:43.430
'what sort of animal is Miss Tiggywinkle?'

17:43.480 --> 17:44.950
A hedgehog.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.430
'Erm... Hmm.'

17:47.480 --> 17:48.950
A hedgehog. A hedgehog!

17:49.000 --> 17:51.350
'Can you repeat the question, please?'

17:51.400 --> 17:53.070
Mrs McCarthy...

17:53.120 --> 17:54.430
Yes?

17:54.480 --> 17:57.880
This passion for quizzes
is becoming obsessive.

18:00.600 --> 18:04.390
Well, I notice that young madam
has invited them all to stay,

18:04.440 --> 18:07.740
so no doubt she'll be
picking up a few hints.

18:09.360 --> 18:10.710
Guess what!

18:10.760 --> 18:14.230
The whole cast has been
carted off to Kembleford nick.

18:14.280 --> 18:16.270
That doesn't surprise me.

18:16.320 --> 18:19.870
Well, it gave me ample time
to search their things.

18:19.920 --> 18:22.320
You had no right to do that!

18:22.880 --> 18:24.750
What did you find?

18:25.920 --> 18:27.920
A little black book.

18:29.520 --> 18:33.110
Look. "If found, please
return to Richie Queenan."

18:33.160 --> 18:35.750
Well, his private life is a riot.

18:35.800 --> 18:38.150
I never knew that about John Gielgud!

18:38.200 --> 18:39.510
Hm!

18:39.560 --> 18:42.190
And look at the last entry, there.

18:42.240 --> 18:45.870
"The plan is always to end
up with one young spunky one

18:45.920 --> 18:47.630
"for the youth audience,

18:47.680 --> 18:50.880
"and a lovable old
fusspot for the elderly."

18:51.320 --> 18:54.190
I'd hang onto the word
lovable, if I was you.

18:54.240 --> 18:55.670
There's more.

18:55.720 --> 18:59.470
"Stop press, our ancient landlady
has now kicked the bucket.

18:59.520 --> 19:04.510
"A tragedy for her, but for me it's
the most marvellous escape route."

19:04.560 --> 19:06.070
Interesting.

19:06.120 --> 19:10.270
Are you thinking that that book
might be connected to the murder?

19:10.320 --> 19:11.470
It's possible.

19:11.520 --> 19:15.990
If Mrs Rudge had read it, she
would know the show was fixed,

19:16.040 --> 19:18.840
and she could have had it cancelled.

19:19.960 --> 19:22.350
And that would make her a serious threat.

19:22.400 --> 19:27.040
But who loves a show enough
to be prepared to kill for it?

19:28.960 --> 19:32.200
W-what's all this about? II
thought it was a blocked chimney.

19:34.360 --> 19:37.830
We now believe it was
blocked deliberately.

19:37.880 --> 19:40.470
Don't look at me. I was
nearly killed myself.

19:40.520 --> 19:45.070
So, who else might have
had it in for Mrs Rudge?

19:45.120 --> 19:48.110
Well, I don't know, really.
I mean, she could be a bit of

19:48.160 --> 19:51.470
a battle-axe, but better than
some of the landladies I've known,

19:51.520 --> 19:52.670
I'll tell you that.

19:52.720 --> 19:55.750
Where were you in the
early part of the evening?

19:55.800 --> 19:59.390
I was with Joyce, in the pub.

19:59.440 --> 20:02.030
You and Joyce go back a long way.

20:02.080 --> 20:04.710
That's right -- we did
Variety Bandbox together.

20:04.760 --> 20:07.350
She played the piano while
I did my yodelling routine.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.800
I remember that! Very droll.

20:11.360 --> 20:12.750
Now...

20:12.800 --> 20:15.510
Tell me about the other cast members.

20:15.560 --> 20:19.190
Well, I'd say we were
a very happy company.

20:19.240 --> 20:22.360
I've known Barney since
the year dot. He's...

20:24.280 --> 20:26.150
.. a dear friend.

20:26.200 --> 20:28.750
And Jeremy's just joined.

20:28.800 --> 20:32.480
He's been to university,
but he seems very nice.

20:33.480 --> 20:35.350
And then Richie...

20:37.240 --> 20:38.440
Yes?

20:39.720 --> 20:42.060
Well, I've just remembered.

20:43.160 --> 20:46.110
Just before we went out this evening,

20:46.160 --> 20:48.390
Richie told Jeremy,

20:48.440 --> 20:53.040
"I hope you and your lady friend
get on like a house on fire."

20:54.920 --> 20:58.030
Well, it's a figure of speech, isn't it?

20:58.080 --> 21:01.230
Like "lie back and think of England".

21:01.280 --> 21:04.550
An unfortunate one, considering
what happened next.

21:04.600 --> 21:07.790
Hang on! Are you accusing me of murder?

21:07.840 --> 21:10.230
I'm just asking you some questions.

21:10.280 --> 21:12.430
Oh, that's fine.

21:12.480 --> 21:15.600
It's a pleasure just to be nominated.

21:21.800 --> 21:23.270
Something the matter?

21:23.320 --> 21:25.760
Just admiring your moustache.

21:27.520 --> 21:31.880
Like a great forest of
virility on a rugged landscape.

21:33.280 --> 21:34.820
Marvellous.

21:37.720 --> 21:41.520
So, can you tell me where you were
in the early part of the evening?

21:44.320 --> 21:47.790
Course I can, treacle.
I went to see a film.

21:47.840 --> 21:50.550
Salome with Rita Hayworth.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.870
Any witnesses to that?

21:52.920 --> 21:54.310
No.

21:54.360 --> 22:00.000
It was very dark, and Rita can't
actually see out of the screen.

22:11.680 --> 22:13.670
St Mary's Presbytery?

22:13.720 --> 22:15.920
Well, I got home safe.

22:17.160 --> 22:19.700
And so did our wandering stars.

22:20.920 --> 22:23.190
What's the mood, exactly?

22:24.120 --> 22:25.710
Doomy.

22:25.760 --> 22:30.070
Although... Richie was singing
a medley of show tunes.

22:30.120 --> 22:33.670
I'm intrigued by the
last line in his journal.

22:33.720 --> 22:36.830
Mrs Rudge's death gives
him an escape route.

22:36.880 --> 22:38.790
From what?

22:38.840 --> 22:40.180
Or who?

22:42.520 --> 22:46.440
Hello, darling! Are you
ready for an adventure?

22:51.640 --> 22:54.750
I could get used to living
in a place like this.

22:54.800 --> 22:57.630
You don't think you'd get lonely?

22:57.680 --> 23:00.320
Just you, rattling around?

23:02.960 --> 23:06.760
Well, I suppose I could
always invite me mother over.

23:09.800 --> 23:10.950
Inspector?

23:11.000 --> 23:15.160
Afternoon. I want to have
a word with Richie Queenan.

23:20.560 --> 23:22.590
He's not been down yet, but he...

23:22.640 --> 23:25.240
Oh! That's very odd.

23:26.400 --> 23:29.140
There's nobody here but Lord Reith.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.350
Lord Reith?

23:31.400 --> 23:34.110
That's the name of his teddy bear.

23:34.160 --> 23:35.870
Right.

23:35.920 --> 23:38.520
And his bed hasn't been slept in.

23:39.040 --> 23:42.720
It looks like he went
out and never came back.

23:44.920 --> 23:46.920
It's all very queer.

23:49.720 --> 23:52.310
So, can you tell me where
Mr Queenan was in the hours

23:52.360 --> 23:55.070
leading up to Mrs Rudge's death?

23:55.120 --> 23:56.830
Why don't you ask him?

23:56.880 --> 24:00.470
We did. He claimed he'd gone
to watch a film called Salome --

24:00.520 --> 24:03.990
a film which, it now transpires,
doesn't open till next week.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.070
Oh.

24:06.120 --> 24:09.420
Which is why we urgently
need to speak to him.

24:13.640 --> 24:15.590
Ah, Inspector. Good afternoon.

24:15.640 --> 24:18.150
Moving in mysterious ways again, are we?

24:18.200 --> 24:23.310
No, I'm here to offer pastoral care
to some visitors to our parish.

24:23.360 --> 24:27.440
Oh, that's awfully jolly dee, but
Jeremy's just called a rehearsal.

24:30.400 --> 24:32.360
Oh, well...

24:34.000 --> 24:37.800
I've always wanted to be a
contestant on a quiz show.

24:39.800 --> 24:43.070
♪ Up to you! Up to you!

24:43.120 --> 24:44.630
♪ Are you going to win tonight?

24:44.680 --> 24:48.070
♪ It's up to you! ♪

24:48.120 --> 24:50.670
And now for our nail-biting finale.

24:50.720 --> 24:52.470
- Father Brown?
- Hello.

24:52.520 --> 24:54.390
Here's an easy one for you.

24:54.440 --> 24:56.910
What is the capital of France?

24:59.000 --> 25:00.430
Do you mean the capital city?

25:00.480 --> 25:01.950
What else would I mean?

25:02.000 --> 25:04.430
Well, capital in the
sense of money, currency,

25:04.480 --> 25:08.190
in which case, the
answer would be... franc.

25:08.240 --> 25:11.150
Well, why would I? I mean,
why would you think that?

25:11.200 --> 25:14.590
Well, I try to think down every pathway.

25:14.640 --> 25:16.310
I-it's a f-fair point.

25:16.360 --> 25:18.150
Perhaps we should change the question.

25:18.200 --> 25:19.910
I'm losing the will to live, here!

25:19.960 --> 25:22.550
We've been doing this for five hours!

25:22.600 --> 25:27.230
Well, I just think we could
f-fine-tune th-the format a bit.

25:27.280 --> 25:31.180
We're just going round in
circles! And where's Richie?

25:33.200 --> 25:34.550
Oh!

25:34.600 --> 25:36.390
Sounds like you've got company.

25:36.440 --> 25:37.590
That must be him.

25:37.640 --> 25:41.630
It's typical Richie. He can
never just slip in quietly.

25:41.680 --> 25:45.280
Because it sounds like the
music is coming from...

25:45.840 --> 25:47.440
.. up there.

26:00.720 --> 26:01.990
Hello?

26:04.240 --> 26:07.030
- Is Mr Queenan in there?
- I don't know, I can't get in.

26:07.080 --> 26:10.030
Erm, I think there's a way to get
doors off with a screwdriver.

26:10.080 --> 26:12.680
Or... there's a quicker way.

26:37.520 --> 26:40.550
I need to know your movements in
the four-hour period leading up

26:40.600 --> 26:42.430
to the discovery of the body.

26:42.480 --> 26:44.030
We were rehearsing.

26:44.080 --> 26:45.870
For six hours. Ad nauseam.

26:45.920 --> 26:48.470
And we do have a very reliable witness.

26:48.520 --> 26:50.190
That'll be me.

26:50.240 --> 26:51.710
Indeed.

26:51.760 --> 26:55.470
We can always rely on the Padre's
presence at every crime scene.

26:55.520 --> 26:58.150
Well, it seems perfectly
clear what's happened.

26:58.200 --> 26:59.550
Does it?

26:59.600 --> 27:02.270
Richie Queenan murdered Mrs Rudge.

27:03.320 --> 27:05.230
We were on the point of arresting him,

27:05.280 --> 27:07.470
following the collapse of his alibi.

27:07.520 --> 27:11.680
He must have got wind of this and
decided to take the easy way out.

27:13.040 --> 27:15.470
But why would he murder
an old lady, Inspector?

27:15.520 --> 27:20.670
Mrs Rudge had become aware
of his... proclivities.

27:20.720 --> 27:22.750
His indiscretions.

27:22.800 --> 27:25.070
And as she was a well-known gossip,

27:25.120 --> 27:28.230
he knew there was only
one way to silence her.

27:28.280 --> 27:30.150
Simple self-preservation.

27:30.200 --> 27:32.940
And what do you mean, proclivities?

27:33.600 --> 27:36.110
Is it the fact that, in
every town we went to,

27:36.160 --> 27:40.110
he would always hurry off in
search of some manual labourer

27:40.160 --> 27:43.390
who might be in the mood
for a drunken bunk-up?

27:43.440 --> 27:48.470
Yes, his love life was unconventional, but

27:48.520 --> 27:50.660
we all... need company.

27:53.440 --> 27:56.110
That's the line I'm pursuing.

27:56.160 --> 28:01.110
But until cause of death is confirmed,

28:01.160 --> 28:04.950
I must insist that you
all stay in Kembleford.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.710
Yeah, well, we've got no choice,

28:06.760 --> 28:10.520
because despite everything else,
we've got a show to do tomorrow.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.950
Police in Kembleford are
investigating the apparent

28:16.000 --> 28:19.190
suicide of radio announcer Richie Queenan.

28:19.240 --> 28:20.990
Mr Queenan had been...

28:21.040 --> 28:23.910
Would you turn that blessed thing off?

28:27.560 --> 28:29.630
I just can't bear it.

28:29.680 --> 28:34.150
I've been listening to that
voice all my adult life,

28:34.200 --> 28:37.190
and, well, to think
that he was a murderer!

28:37.240 --> 28:39.110
That's what they think,

28:39.160 --> 28:42.670
but do you really think he killed Mrs R

28:42.720 --> 28:44.350
and then killed himself?

28:44.400 --> 28:48.510
All our suspects were
downstairs, rehearsing the quiz.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.430
Oh, yes, the quiz!

28:50.880 --> 28:53.390
Well, I can hardly believe
it's going to go ahead now.

28:53.440 --> 28:56.740
Well, there are 15
million listeners waiting.

29:00.560 --> 29:02.720
Rasputin, ravioli...

29:04.080 --> 29:06.390
.. rigor mortis.

29:06.440 --> 29:12.360
"Rigor mortis generally sets in
three to four hours after death...

29:16.200 --> 29:20.510
.."but can be delayed by
immersion in cold water."

29:20.560 --> 29:22.470
Well, the water was freezing!

29:22.520 --> 29:25.590
He could have been lying there
for a couple of hours, pickled.

29:25.640 --> 29:28.760
- Indeed. - But I thought
that door was locked.

29:30.600 --> 29:34.350
Place the body in the bath, lock the door,

29:34.400 --> 29:36.670
climb out of the window...

29:37.000 --> 29:38.910
.. and leave it ajar.

29:38.960 --> 29:40.830
But then, who turned on the radio?

29:40.880 --> 29:42.950
We were all miles away.

29:43.000 --> 29:46.680
And why would any of them
want to commit a double murder?

29:47.840 --> 29:50.040
That is still a mystery.

29:51.040 --> 29:52.580
Like you...

29:53.720 --> 29:56.460
.. I have many questions to answer.

29:57.640 --> 29:59.150
Hello, folks!

29:59.200 --> 30:00.670
How do? How do?

30:00.720 --> 30:03.310
Welcome to the show that wanders
the highways and byways...

30:03.360 --> 30:04.910
Yes, yes.

30:04.960 --> 30:07.790
Yes, left. Left at the church.

30:07.840 --> 30:09.070
Right, goodbye.

30:09.120 --> 30:11.590
Can you not pipe down for
a blithering moment?!

30:11.640 --> 30:13.390
Our announcer's lost again.

30:13.440 --> 30:16.790
I'm losing the will to live, with
all these constant interruptions.

30:16.840 --> 30:19.510
Jeremy, dear, it's all
getting a bit fraught.

30:19.560 --> 30:23.160
Why don't you go and check
on the lost announcer?

30:24.840 --> 30:27.440
Fraught? That's one word for it.

30:28.160 --> 30:31.190
Do you know, I'm that close
to spontaneously combusting.

30:31.240 --> 30:34.550
Well, before you go up in smoke,
there's something I need to ask you.

30:34.600 --> 30:35.830
Oh, yeah?

30:35.880 --> 30:37.790
Where were you on Friday night?

30:37.840 --> 30:40.640
- What?
- The night Mrs Rudge was...

30:42.720 --> 30:45.430
I told you before -- it's
none of your beeswax!

30:45.480 --> 30:48.470
Look, I was willing to
give you an alibi --

30:48.520 --> 30:50.830
it just seemed the right
thing to do at the time.

30:50.880 --> 30:52.590
But now, I need to know.

30:52.640 --> 30:54.630
No, you don't!

30:54.680 --> 30:57.550
All you need to do is play the
piano and keep the people happy.

30:57.600 --> 31:00.030
And you'd make me happy if
you'd stop poking your finger

31:00.080 --> 31:02.820
into things that don't concern you!

31:07.120 --> 31:10.910
Just remember that
winning isn't everything.

31:10.960 --> 31:12.670
They used to say that at school.

31:12.720 --> 31:15.190
I never believed a word of it.

31:17.040 --> 31:18.710
Mrs McCarthy!

31:19.920 --> 31:21.260
Miss...

31:23.800 --> 31:25.270
Windermere.

31:25.320 --> 31:27.430
Yes! Come this way.

31:27.480 --> 31:29.190
Oh, thank you.

31:29.240 --> 31:30.710
Good luck!

31:38.960 --> 31:41.560
Erm, if you'd like to wait here.

31:44.120 --> 31:47.120
Oh, I was so sorry, dear, at the sad news.

31:49.280 --> 31:53.070
Oh, my dear, you look
like a Hollywood star!

31:53.120 --> 31:55.430
You're not so shabby yourself.

31:55.480 --> 31:57.880
No, I don't feel very pretty.

31:58.280 --> 32:00.110
What do you mean?

32:00.160 --> 32:02.230
Well, it's Barney.

32:02.280 --> 32:04.710
He can be awfully difficult.

32:04.760 --> 32:06.110
Yes.

32:06.160 --> 32:09.320
Though he's only really
difficult when you're around.

32:10.920 --> 32:12.670
What?

32:12.720 --> 32:16.470
It's attention-seeking behaviour,
and it's your attention he wants.

32:16.520 --> 32:19.320
Oh, I don't think that's true at all.

32:20.720 --> 32:21.990
Is it?

32:24.560 --> 32:27.310
I'll be glad to see the back
of these show-business types.

32:27.360 --> 32:30.030
They're not the same as the likes of us.

32:30.080 --> 32:31.310
No, sir.

32:31.360 --> 32:34.360
Calling everyone "luvvy" or "treacle"...

32:35.480 --> 32:38.030
Well, I just suppose it's the
way they talk to each other...

32:38.080 --> 32:40.910
Hold on! They're starting.

32:40.960 --> 32:42.630
♪ Are you going to win tonight?

32:42.680 --> 32:45.040
♪ It's up to you! ♪

32:46.920 --> 32:48.390
So, at the end of that round,

32:48.440 --> 32:51.740
we are teetering on the
brink of a precipice.

32:52.040 --> 32:54.190
- Mrs McCarthy?
- Hello.

32:54.240 --> 32:56.110
You do not have to answer this question.

32:56.160 --> 32:58.790
If you get it right, you get five points.

32:58.840 --> 33:02.040
If you get it wrong,
you'll lose ten points.

33:02.960 --> 33:05.670
Are you going to go for it? It's...

33:05.720 --> 33:08.350
Up to you!

33:08.400 --> 33:10.630
Yes, I will!

33:10.680 --> 33:13.470
Isn't she brave? Champion.
Well done, well done.

33:13.520 --> 33:15.750
Right, the question...

33:15.800 --> 33:19.510
The palmier biscuit
contains three ingredients --

33:19.560 --> 33:24.150
sugar, salt, and what type of pastry?

33:24.200 --> 33:26.400
The palmier...

33:27.640 --> 33:29.390
I have no idea.

33:29.440 --> 33:31.240
It's shortcrust!

33:31.500 --> 33:32.990
Oh, dear.

33:33.040 --> 33:34.910
Sorry, it's puff.

33:37.280 --> 33:38.550
Miss Windermere?

33:38.600 --> 33:39.790
Yes.

33:39.840 --> 33:43.550
St Gertrude of Nivelles is the
patron saint of what creature?

33:48.520 --> 33:50.550
Is it... cats?

33:52.720 --> 33:54.430
Well done, well done.

33:54.480 --> 33:57.110
- Are you fond of our furry friends?
- Oh, I adore them.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.240
Kittens...

34:00.960 --> 34:02.070
Excuse me.

34:02.120 --> 34:05.880
Now, your next question, your
bonus question, is also about cats.

34:07.920 --> 34:11.110
Are you going to go for it? It's...

34:11.159 --> 34:12.719
Up to you!

34:14.920 --> 34:16.520
Oh! Um, yes.

34:18.280 --> 34:21.510
What is the collective noun
for a group of kittens?

34:31.280 --> 34:34.719
Oh, dear. I'm so sorry, Miss
Windermere, you're out of time.

34:37.719 --> 34:39.469
May I have a word?

34:39.520 --> 34:41.389
Can it wait?

34:41.440 --> 34:43.510
I don't think so, no.

34:52.400 --> 34:55.110
You really do have a talent for radio.

34:55.159 --> 34:57.390
Oh, well done. You're not
just a pretty face, are you?

34:57.440 --> 35:00.270
Creating imaginary worlds
from just a few sounds.

35:00.320 --> 35:04.230
So, then, it's one-all and all for
one and everything to play for.

35:04.280 --> 35:07.680
And you've been manipulating
us the whole time.

35:09.400 --> 35:13.110
You led Bunty to the boarding house
when you knew the ground floor

35:13.160 --> 35:15.030
would be full of smoke.

35:15.080 --> 35:18.990
And yesterday, you called a
rehearsal to give yourself

35:19.040 --> 35:22.200
an alibi when Richie Queenan's
body was discovered.

35:24.440 --> 35:28.000
You killed Mr Queenan and Mrs Rudge.

35:29.040 --> 35:31.040
Why would I do that?

35:31.800 --> 35:34.600
I don't think that you meant to kill.

35:35.280 --> 35:38.680
But you became obsessed
with a beautiful woman.

35:39.100 --> 35:41.390
God bless us, every one.

35:41.440 --> 35:45.600
Someone you thought would
never give you a second glance.

35:47.040 --> 35:51.390
So you used your brilliant, inventive mind

35:51.440 --> 35:54.230
to fill a house full of smoke.

35:54.280 --> 35:58.230
Your plan was to run
in, rescue the kittens,

35:58.280 --> 36:00.640
and run out a hero.

36:01.880 --> 36:04.150
But now you had a problem.

36:05.160 --> 36:08.550
Living with three nosy, gossipy,

36:08.600 --> 36:11.590
inquisitive performers,

36:11.640 --> 36:16.640
someone was bound to find
out who killed Mrs Rudge.

36:19.720 --> 36:21.320
Richie knew.

36:23.080 --> 36:25.470
He saw me put the device up the chimney.

36:25.520 --> 36:27.630
He nagged me till he found out what it was

36:27.680 --> 36:29.230
and then he teased me.

36:29.280 --> 36:32.870
Pay no attention. You run
along and meet your female.

36:32.920 --> 36:36.120
I'm sure you'll get on
like a house on fire.

36:38.280 --> 36:40.480
Was he blackmailing you?

36:41.160 --> 36:43.230
Actually, he was kind.

36:44.400 --> 36:48.030
Hello, darling! Are you
ready for an adventure?

36:48.080 --> 36:50.390
'He even asked me out for the evening.

36:50.440 --> 36:52.670
'He took me to a small hotel,
gave me a glorious meal,

36:52.720 --> 36:54.710
'told me it would a-all be OK.

36:54.760 --> 36:56.710
'It was just a t-terrible mistake,

36:56.760 --> 36:59.070
'and I shouldn't let it
destroy my whole career.'

36:59.120 --> 37:03.910
I imagine Richie Queenan's
kindness came at a price.

37:03.960 --> 37:05.300
It did.

37:07.080 --> 37:08.430
When we'd finished eating,

37:08.480 --> 37:10.550
he said something that put
the fear of God into me.

37:10.600 --> 37:12.670
Guess what, darling...

37:13.280 --> 37:15.990
I've written a script!

37:16.040 --> 37:18.910
'He'd written some sort of... comedy.'

37:20.080 --> 37:22.230
The Richie Queenan Show.

37:22.280 --> 37:24.510
I looked through.

37:24.560 --> 37:26.230
It was awful.

37:27.520 --> 37:30.990
But he now had the power
of life or death over me.

37:31.040 --> 37:32.310
So I said...

37:32.360 --> 37:34.880
Wow, it... it's wonderful!

37:36.720 --> 37:38.790
Of course we'll get it on the BBC.

37:38.840 --> 37:41.180
You're a national treasure.

37:42.960 --> 37:45.030
'We went back to Montague.

37:45.080 --> 37:47.910
'I was trying to calm him
down, but he was so happy.

37:47.960 --> 37:49.790
'He was going to wake up the whole house.'

37:49.840 --> 37:51.070
Quiet!

37:51.120 --> 37:55.310
Barney, Joycey, come
and hear the theme tune!

37:55.360 --> 37:57.150

38:26.200 --> 38:30.640
So, then you had another

till six o'clock PM.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.800
'It was almost soothing,
to hold him under the water.

39:14.680 --> 39:18.080
'And I wished that I could
just wash him away.'

39:18.680 --> 39:23.080
And wash myself away, and
wash away everything I'd done.

39:25.800 --> 39:27.400
And, well...

39:28.960 --> 39:32.320
If you confess, and repent...

39:33.400 --> 39:36.550
.. God will wash away your sins.

39:36.600 --> 39:40.510
And stand beside me as I hang?

39:40.560 --> 39:45.800
If you run, you WILL
face the hangman's noose.

39:48.160 --> 39:51.310
If you tell the police what happened,

39:51.360 --> 39:54.080
you may get a custodial sentence.

40:02.840 --> 40:04.180
Prison?

40:05.880 --> 40:09.180
It could hardly be worse
than boarding school.

40:10.080 --> 40:14.120
And if it stops Richie's family
from believing the worst of him...

40:15.920 --> 40:18.670
- It's too late for that.
- Sorry?

40:18.720 --> 40:21.070
It was broadcast today on the radio --

40:21.120 --> 40:25.190
Richie Queenan committed suicide,

40:25.240 --> 40:27.510
consumed with guilt for the murder.

40:27.560 --> 40:30.310
But n-n-no. No, but that's an inaccuracy.

40:30.360 --> 40:32.360
They can't say that.

40:32.680 --> 40:35.080
So, folks, I think we all...

40:36.560 --> 40:38.070
- Hello.
- What you doing?!

40:38.120 --> 40:41.400
My name is Jeremy and...
I've come to confess.

40:42.600 --> 40:44.540
I killed Mrs Rudge.

40:45.840 --> 40:47.780
And Richie Queenan.

41:09.200 --> 41:12.190
Shall we go round and arrest him, sir?

41:12.240 --> 41:14.880
Yes, Sergeant. Obviously.

41:21.240 --> 41:23.380
What time is our train?

41:24.000 --> 41:25.230
Why are you asking me?

41:25.280 --> 41:28.030
- Sorry? - Well, you
don't trust me, do you?

41:28.080 --> 41:30.070
"Where were you on the
night of the murder?"

41:30.120 --> 41:31.990
I never accused you,

41:32.040 --> 41:35.560
I just don't know why you
were keeping secrets from me.

41:36.680 --> 41:38.550
All right, I'll tell you.

41:38.600 --> 41:43.000
I'd gone to see a very talented
man that lives around here...

41:43.760 --> 41:45.710
.. who makes hairpieces.

41:45.760 --> 41:47.400
Oh, Barney!

41:49.080 --> 41:51.310
That looks very...

41:51.360 --> 41:52.830
luxuriant.

41:53.840 --> 41:56.710
But why did you feel it was necessary?

41:57.720 --> 41:59.790
Well, you know...

41:59.840 --> 42:01.270
The star of the show, and that.

42:01.320 --> 42:03.950
I didn't want people thinking,
"Oh, he's losing his follicles."

42:04.000 --> 42:05.630
But it's a radio show.

42:05.680 --> 42:07.390
I know.

42:07.440 --> 42:10.040
But the piano player can see me.

42:12.240 --> 42:15.310
Well, bon voyage.

42:15.360 --> 42:17.190
Yeah, our train's in ten minutes.

42:17.240 --> 42:20.470
Before you go, there's just
one thing I need to ask you.

42:20.520 --> 42:21.710
Yeah?

42:21.760 --> 42:23.630
Who won the quiz?

42:24.520 --> 42:26.670
What? I don't know.

42:26.720 --> 42:29.310
To be honest, I had
other things on my mind.

42:29.360 --> 42:31.550
Oh, right.

42:31.600 --> 42:33.190
Shall we say it was a draw?

42:33.240 --> 42:34.990
Yes, of course.

42:35.040 --> 42:36.830
Congratulations, Penelope.

42:36.880 --> 42:38.620
And you, Mrs M.

42:40.520 --> 42:42.750
Well, good luck with the show.

42:42.800 --> 42:44.590
Thank you very much.

42:44.640 --> 42:47.430
We're not going to do the show any more.

42:47.480 --> 42:48.800
What?!

42:51.400 --> 42:54.190
I've been doing it for ten years now, and,

42:54.240 --> 42:56.590
well, my heart's not really in it.

42:56.640 --> 43:00.990
And I've behaved very badly
to the people around me.

43:01.040 --> 43:05.200
That's a very brave decision,
leaving a successful quiz.

43:07.560 --> 43:10.660
Maybe today is the day
for brave decisions.

43:12.920 --> 43:15.070
I've been doing the
show for ten years too,

43:15.120 --> 43:20.590
and in all that time, you've
been a belligerent bully,

43:20.640 --> 43:23.600
utterly ungrateful for my contribution.

43:25.600 --> 43:28.540
But for all that, Barney Butterfield...

43:29.000 --> 43:30.710
.. I love you.

43:30.760 --> 43:31.910
What?!

43:31.960 --> 43:34.300
Don't make me say it again.

43:41.160 --> 43:42.750
They have a train to catch!

43:42.800 --> 43:44.110
Quite.

43:52.800 --> 43:54.360
Goodbye.

44:01.880 --> 44:03.470
Goodness!

44:03.520 --> 44:07.120
What am I going to do with
my Sunday evenings now?

44:08.000 --> 44:09.750
