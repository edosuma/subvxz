Her name's Rose.

Hey, Rose,

00:44.964 --> 00:47.798
I told Alan that we met.
Boy, did you call that one.

00:47.800 --> 00:49.833
Let me guess.
At some point did he say,

He is very suspicious of you.

00:58.377 --> 01:00.260

01:27.556 --> 01:30.124
Yes, I'm measuring

01:33.596 --> 01:35.829
Well, I believe I did most
of the driving.

01:35.831 --> 01:37.681
Yes. But when you got
a flat,

01:37.683 --> 01:39.566
I stopped and
pumped it up.

01:44.140 --> 01:49.176
Call me crazy-- and the State of
California did for a while--

02:37.576 --> 02:44.131
Uh, no. I was thinking more
like you move in with me.

02:44.133 --> 02:47.835
Hmm, that's a little odd.

02:47.837 --> 02:49.953

Why not?

02:53.242 --> 02:55.793
Why not?

02:55.795 --> 02:58.411

a cheese plate

03:06.889 --> 03:09.223
and you get two different
kinds of stinky cheese

03:09.225 --> 03:13.393
and then you eat that little,
bland, unsalted cracker

03:13.395 --> 03:14.778
in between to cleanse
your palate?

03:14.780 --> 03:19.633
Not really, but you
explained it pretty well.

03:19.635 --> 03:23.570
Well, I don't want to be
the bland cracker.

03:25.941 --> 03:27.958
Okay, I think I understand.

I just got out
