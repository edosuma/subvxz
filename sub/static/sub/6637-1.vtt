02:07.880 --> 02:08.995
I'm on the phone.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.950
When do you come back?
Not till then?

02:12.160 --> 02:14.879
It's not even rated R.
He's just being a jerk.

02:15.960 --> 02:18.428
Kevin, if Uncle Frank says no...

02:18.640 --> 02:20.198
...then it must be really bad.

02:20.440 --> 02:23.432
No, we put the dog in the kennel...
Hey, get off!

02:23.640 --> 02:24.755
Kevin, out of the room.

02:24.960 --> 02:27.155
Hang up the phone and make me,
why don't you?

02:27.360 --> 02:28.270
This kid.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.948
Did you pick up
a voltage adapter thing?

02:31.160 --> 02:32.639
No, I didn't have time.

02:32.840 --> 02:35.479
- Then how do I shave in France?
- Grow a goatee.

02:35.680 --> 02:37.716
Dad, nobody'll let me do anything.

02:37.920 --> 02:42.038

02:47.000 --> 02:48.035
We talked about that.

02:48.400 --> 02:51.153
Did I burn down the joint?
I don't think so.

02:51.360 --> 02:53.157
I made ornaments out of fish hooks.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.151
- My new fish hooks?
- I can't make them out of old ones...

02:57.400 --> 02:59.630

Here's a voltage adapter!

Go pack your suitcase.

03:15.640 --> 03:17.710
- Where's the shampoo?
- I don't live here.

03:17.920 --> 03:20.115
This many people here and no shampoo.

- Buzz did.

03:25.160 --> 03:27.071
Excuse me. Are your parents here?

03:27.320 --> 03:28.799
My parents live in Paris.

03:29.000 --> 03:29.989
- Hi!
- Hi!

03:30.200 --> 03:31.349
- Are your parents home?
- Yeah.

03:31.560 --> 03:33.630
- Do they live here?
- No.

03:34.640 --> 03:37.108
Why should they?
All kids, no parents.

03:37.360 --> 03:38.634
Probably a fancy orphanage.

03:39.080 --> 03:42.629
I don't know how to pack a suitcase.
I've never done it once.

03:42.840 --> 03:44.876
- Tough.
- That's what Megan said.

03:45.080 --> 03:46.274
MEGAN:
What did I say?

03:46.480 --> 03:47.469
You told him "Tough."

03:47.680 --> 03:50.956
The dope was whining about a suitcase.
What was I supposed to say?

03:51.160 --> 03:52.673
"Congratulations, you're an idiot"?

03:52.880 --> 03:54.359
- I'm not an idiot!
- Really?

03:54.560 --> 03:57.518
You're helpless! We have to do
everything for you.

03:57.720 --> 04:00.757
- She's right, Kev.
- Excuse me, puke-breath. I'm small.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.558
I don't know how to pack.

04:02.760 --> 04:06.036
- I hope you didn't just pack crap.
- Shut up, Linnie.

04:06.240 --> 04:07.355
What should I pack?

04:07.560 --> 04:10.870
Buzz told you, cheek-face.
Toilet paper and water.

04:12.200 --> 04:13.872
What are you so worried about?

04:14.080 --> 04:16.548
You know Mom's gonna
pack your stuff, anyway.

04:16.800 --> 04:19.757
You're what the French call
<i>les incompetents.</i>

04:19.959 --> 04:20.915
What?

04:22.160 --> 04:23.673
Bombs away!

04:27.760 --> 04:31.309
P.S. You have to sleep
on the hide-a-bed with Fuller.

04:31.520 --> 04:34.512
If he has something to drink,
he'll wet the bed.

04:35.280 --> 04:37.919
This house is so full of people
it makes me sick!

04:38.120 --> 04:40.759

I'm living alone!

Who's gonna feed your spider?

04:51.640 --> 04:55.269
He just ate a load of mice guts.
He'll be good for a couple weeks.

04:56.960 --> 04:59.713
Is it true French babes
don't shave their pits?

05:00.360 --> 05:01.349
Some don't.

05:02.840 --> 05:04.273
But they got nude beaches.

05:04.480 --> 05:05.629
Not in the winter.

05:11.800 --> 05:13.119

05:13.360 --> 05:15.396
Don't you know how to knock,
phlegm-wad?

05:15.800 --> 05:18.872
Can I sleep here?
I don't want to sleep with Fuller.

05:19.080 --> 05:20.832
If he drinks, he'll wet the bed.

05:21.400 --> 05:25.439

the South Bend Shovel Slayer?

05:40.040 --> 05:41.519
ROD: No.
BUZZ: That's him.

05:41.720 --> 05:46.350
BUZZ: In '58 he murdered his family
and half the people on his block...

05:47.480 --> 05:49.391
...with a snow shovel.

05:49.880 --> 05:52.758
Been hiding out
in this neighborhood ever since.

05:52.960 --> 05:56.350
If he's the Shovel Slayer,
how come the cops don't arrest him?

05:56.560 --> 05:58.232
Not enough evidence to convict.

05:58.920 --> 06:00.876
They never found the bodies.

06:01.120 --> 06:03.076
Everyone around here knows he did it.

06:03.640 --> 06:05.437
It'll just be a matter of time...

06:05.640 --> 06:07.596
...before he does it again.

06:07.800 --> 06:08.710
What's he doing?

06:09.560 --> 06:12.393
BUZZ: He walks up and down
the streets every night...

06:12.600 --> 06:14.795
...salting the sidewalks.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.877

Maybe he's just trying to be nice.

06:18.520 --> 06:20.158
No way.

06:20.760 --> 06:23.115
See that garbage can full of salt?

06:23.840 --> 06:26.434
That's where he keeps his victims.

06:26.640 --> 06:29.313
The salt turns the bodies...

06:29.560 --> 06:31.278
...into mummies.

06:32.520 --> 06:35.114
ROD: Wow.
- Mummies!

- The Mr. McCallister who lives here?
- Yes.

You're always welcome at church.

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:36.191
I'm not welcome with my son.

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:41.195
Years back, before you and your family
moved on the block...

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:43.478
...I had an argument with my son.

01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:45.269
How old is he?

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:47.079
He's grown up.

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:52.871
We lost our tempers, and I said
I didn't care to see him anymore.

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:57.512
He said the same, and we haven't
spoken to each other since.

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:00.790
If you miss him,
why don't you call him?

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:03.436
I'm afraid if I call,
he won't talk to me.

01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:05.073
How do you know?

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:08.634
I don't know.
I'm just afraid he won't.

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:12.278
No offense, but aren't you
a little old to be afraid?

01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:15.710
You can be old for a lot of things.

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:18.593
- You're never too old to be afraid.
- That's true.

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:20.631
I was afraid of our basement.

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:23.991
It's dark. There's weird stuff
down there, and it smells funny.

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:27.510
That sort of thing.
It's bothered me for years.

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:28.995
Basements are like that.

01:08:30.279 --> 01:08:32.555
I made myself go down
to do some laundry...

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:34.796
...and I found out it's not so bad.

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:39.430
I worried about it, but if you
turn on the lights, it's no big deal.

01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:40.709
What's your point?

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:43.799
My point is,
you should call your son.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:47.359
- What if he won't talk to me?
- At least you'll know.

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:51.758
Then you could stop worrying about it.
You won't have to be afraid anymore.

01:08:52.399 --> 01:08:57.234
No matter how mad I was, I'd talk to
Dad. Especially around the holidays.

01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:00.433
I don't know.

01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:03.438
Just give it a shot.
For your granddaughter anyway.

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:06.716
I'm sure she misses you.
And the presents.

01:09:07.399 --> 01:09:08.674
I send her a check.

01:09:09.359 --> 01:09:12.796
I wish my grandparents did that.
They always send me clothes.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.719
Last year I got a sweater
with a bird knitted on it.

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:16.950
Oh, that's nice.

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:19.196
Not for a guy in the second grade.

01:09:19.399 --> 01:09:21.868
You can get beat up
for wearing something like that.

01:09:25.399 --> 01:09:28.153

he wore dinosaur pajamas.

- Wet Bandits, that's W-E-T...
- Shut up! Get in the car!

01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:28.918
COP:
Hey, come on. Come on.

01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:32.069
- Hand off the head, pal!
- Come on.

01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:38.318
(" HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY
LITTLE CHRISTMAS" PLAYS)

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:27.231
KATE:
<i>I'm a bad parent. I'm a bad parent.</i>

01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:28.595
No, you're not.

01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:31.189
You're beating yourself up there.
This happens.

01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:33.038
These things happen.

01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:36.949
You want to talk about bad parents?
Look at us.

01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:41.711
We're on the road 48, 49 weeks a year.
We hardly see our families.

01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:44.550
Joe, over there. Gosh, you know...

01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:47.479
...he forgets his kids' names
half the time.

01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:50.831
Ziggy over there,
he's never even met his kid.

01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:54.675
Eddy... Let's just hope
none of them write a book about him.

01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:59.116
Tell me, have you gone on vacation
and left your child home?

01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:03.719
No.

01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:07.233
But I did leave one
at a funeral parlor once.

01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:11.157
Yeah, it was terrible too.
I was all distraught and everything.

01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:15.433
The wife and I, we left the little
tyke there in the funeral parlor.

01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:19.195
All day. You know, we went
back at night, when we...

01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:21.550
...came to our senses,
there he was.

01:29:21.800 --> 01:29:24.758
Apparently, he was there
all day with a corpse.

01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:28.951
He was okay.
You know, after six, seven weeks.

01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:31.515
He came around
and started talking again.

01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:35.718
They get over it.
Kids are resilient like that.

01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:37.558
We shouldn't talk about this.

01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:41.759
- I was just trying to cheer you up.
- I'm sorry I did.

01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:08.029
Mom?

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:14.228
Mom?

01:30:18.280 --> 01:30:19.793
Mom?

01:31:04.520 --> 01:31:05.794
Kevin!

01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:08.316
Kevin!

01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:29.548
(SIGHS)

01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:40.237
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:51.669
Oh, Kevin, I'm so sorry.

01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:12.518
Where's everybody else?

01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:15.111
Oh, baby, they couldn't come.

01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:16.514
They wanted to so much...

01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:20.998
I didn't fall asleep in the back
and drool all over you, did I?

01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:23.430
BUZZ: You do drool!
LINNIE: Shut up!

01:32:24.680 --> 01:32:25.908
Kevin!

01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:29.630
Kevin, my boy. How are you?
It's good to see you.

01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:31.512
You're all right.

01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:33.154
I love you. You okay?

01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:34.515
Yeah.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:35.796
Hey, Kev.

01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:40.594
It's cool that you didn't
burn the place down.

01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:44.279
Thanks, Buzz.

01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:47.831
Wait a minute.
How'd you guys get home?

01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:50.429
On the morning flight
you didn't want to wait for.

01:32:50.640 --> 01:32:53.757
- Oh, no. Oh! Thank you.
- Merry Christmas.

01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:55.313
KATE:
Merry Christmas.

01:32:55.920 --> 01:32:57.911
Someone has to find an open store.

01:32:58.120 --> 01:32:59.678
I went shopping yesterday.

01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:03.719
You, shopping?

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.594
I got some milk, eggs
and fabric softener.

01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:10.277
- What?
- No kidding?

01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:12.118
What a funny guy.

01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:14.356
What else did you do
while we were away?

01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:17.630
Just hung around.

01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:19.393
(LAUGHING)

01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:21.039
KATE:
Bring your stuff upstairs.

01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:25.597
BUZZ: Shopping? He doesn't know how
to tie his shoe. He's going shopping?

01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:52.799
Honey, what's this?

01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:52.156
BUZZ: Kevin! What did you do
to my room?
