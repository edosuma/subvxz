03:03.083 --> 03:04.000
What a joke.

03:06.375 --> 03:08.875
- You could just
be cool about it.

03:08.916 --> 03:10.916
- He's only gonna slow us down.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.375
- [Andre] I'll
keep an eye on him.

04:06.583 --> 04:07.916

04:07.958 --> 04:09.625
- Nah, the old road s blocked.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.291
Gotta go the rest
of the way on foot.

04:15.791 --> 04:17.125
We gotta hustle, man.

So listen, stick together,

04:38.375 --> 04:40.208
- I m serious, man.

04:40.250 --> 04:42.083
Common sense stuff.

04:42.125 --> 04:44.458
- [Michael] So what
is this place exactly?

04:44.500 --> 04:45.791
- [Andre] It s an
old power station.

04:45.833 --> 04:47.416
- Virgin?

04:47.458 --> 04:50.041
- Fuck no, every crew in the
last 20 years has had a crack.

04:51.583 --> 04:53.333

It'll be awesome.

find out about this place?

05:09.625 --> 05:12.500
- [Andre] This guy was posting
on the net a few years back.

05:13.375 --> 05:15.541
- [Andre] You know this guy?

05:15.583 --> 05:17.500
- [Andre] Well no,
just some blogger.

believe you d trust

05:20.500 --> 05:21.916

05:23.250 --> 05:25.416

- Mate, I always know which
way s which, all right?

08:42.375 --> 08:45.208
- Rowan s just jealous of our
superior's survival skills.

08:45.250 --> 08:46.416

were pitching tents

08:47.875 --> 08:50.041

pubs and smashing box.

Ask your sister.

- [Michael] We ve got
to be close now, right?

There she is.

10:04.500 --> 10:07.500
- Clearly a popular
destination for urban artists.

10:09.625 --> 10:12.041
- This place s been
abandoned for decades.

10:12.083 --> 10:13.791
It's got a whole
new history now.

and broken bottles.

- [Michael] You think
there's any security?

10:50.791 --> 10:52.250
- Yeah, we'll have to
make a break for it

10:52.291 --> 10:53.333
when they change the guard.

10:53.375 --> 10:55.291
- We re way off grid, man.

10:55.333 --> 10:57.750
I don't think anybody's
been here for years.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.583
- They d have to
be as crazy as us.

11:02.166 --> 11:03.250
- Or crazier.

When humans have finished
fucking everything up.

13:36.666 --> 13:39.375
We need to find a way
into the next annex.

13:39.416 --> 13:41.625
Hopefully we don't
have to break a window.

13:41.666 --> 13:43.500
- Such a soft cock.

13:43.541 --> 13:46.500
Lucky to find a window in
here that isn't broken.

13:46.541 --> 13:48.583
- It's the principle
of the thing.

13:48.625 --> 13:50.208
I'm not a criminal or a vandal.

13:52.125 --> 13:53.375
I'm just looking around.

13:54.958 --> 13:55.958
- Righto.

14:05.375 --> 14:06.166
Guys!

14:24.875 --> 14:26.500
- You think someone
was living here?

14:27.916 --> 14:31.125
- What kind of a filthy fuck
up would live in this pit?

14:32.875 --> 14:34.208
- Watch out!

14:34.250 --> 14:35.500
- [Rowan] Shit!

14:43.916 --> 14:45.583
- Get one of these stuck in you

14:45.625 --> 14:49.500
and you might end up with
AIDS or hepatitis or worse.

14:55.041 --> 14:57.291
- Fucking junkie pricks.

14:57.333 --> 14:59.000
- It s usually just local
kids that come and hang out,

14:59.041 --> 15:00.916
tag, shoot up,
that kind of thing.

15:04.375 --> 15:06.333
- I thought you said we
were way off the grid?

15:06.375 --> 15:07.166
- Yeah, we are.

15:09.291 --> 15:11.375
- [Michael] Then there
aren't any local kids.

15:15.500 --> 15:16.875
- What is your problem?

15:18.041 --> 15:20.416
- I just wanna know
what's going on.

15:20.458 --> 15:21.750
One minute, we're off the grid,

15:21.791 --> 15:23.000
next minute this is
the local hang out.

15:23.041 --> 15:25.125

definitely living here

- I don't know.

15:28.250 --> 15:30.000
How am I supposed to know?

15:30.041 --> 15:31.583

was your idea!

check these out?

15:58.750 --> 16:01.375
- Nah, let's just stick
to the main corridor,

16:01.416 --> 16:03.666
but keep your eyes open
for any more stairs.

16:03.708 --> 16:04.416
- Why?

16:06.541 --> 16:07.458
- There s meant to be
an old service tunnel

16:07.500 --> 16:09.083
down here somewhere.

16:09.125 --> 16:10.041
- A tunnel to where?

16:12.125 --> 16:16.083
- Dunno, doesn't matter,
just be cool to find it.

16:32.208 --> 16:33.458
- There s someone else here.

16:35.000 --> 16:35.791
- Sure?

16:38.125 --> 16:40.000
- What else could
make that noise?

16:41.791 --> 16:43.750
- Something shifting
in the wind maybe?

16:46.000 --> 16:47.041
- Maybe.

16:50.208 --> 16:53.208
Let s try not to
make so much noise.

There s gotta be
a way down there.

pretty impressive.

You're with your girlfriend.

you look beautiful.

17:48.958 --> 17:49.666

17:58.000 --> 17:59.250
- [Michael] Hey wait,
wait, wait, what s that?

17:59.291 --> 18:00.041
- [Rowan] What?

18:00.083 --> 18:01.125
- Go back.

18:01.166 --> 18:02.250
Back, back.

18:03.166 --> 18:04.208
There.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.208
What the hell's that?

18:06.166 --> 18:07.208
- Zoom in.

18:11.208 --> 18:12.500
- What is that?

18:14.291 --> 18:16.291
- It's hard to tell.

18:16.333 --> 18:18.708
Could just be more wreckage
or graffiti or something.

18:19.833 --> 18:21.541
- Fucking creepy whatever it is.

18:31.083 --> 18:34.208
Black as the devil s
arsehole down there.

18:48.083 --> 18:48.875

18:52.916 --> 18:53.708
- Oh, dude

18:54.666 --> 18:55.500
- Doesn t matter.

18:55.541 --> 18:56.250
Fuck it.

18:57.458 --> 19:00.125
- Look, you can't
blame yourself.

19:00.166 --> 19:01.041
Shit happens.

19:02.333 --> 19:03.458
- Shit certainly happened.

19:04.458 --> 19:06.375
- Mate, you're the lucky one.

19:06.416 --> 19:07.583
You're out of it now.

19:08.791 --> 19:10.250
I mean do you really
want to be with somebody

19:10.291 --> 19:11.500
who does that to you?

19:12.583 --> 19:14.166
- I should ve fought for her.

[spray paint clacking]

19:18.250 --> 19:23.166
- [Andre] What the hell?

19:25.791 --> 19:27.291
What the fuck are you doing?

19:33.291 --> 19:34.625
- What does it look like?

19:35.458 --> 19:36.875
- Arsehole!

19:36.916 --> 19:40.708
I said no vandalism, how
fucking hard is that?

19:40.750 --> 19:41.500
- What the fuck is your problem?

19:41.541 --> 19:43.291
Loosen up, man.

19:43.333 --> 19:44.041
- Fuck.

19:46.500 --> 19:50.500
- Oh, I m not here
just to creep around.

19:50.541 --> 19:52.208
- Then what are you here for?

19:52.250 --> 19:54.458
- I m here to break shit
and piss in the corner.

19:54.500 --> 19:57.541
Look around mate, no one
gives a fuck about this joint.

19:57.583 --> 19:59.458
- Go ahead and be a
dick about it then.

19:59.500 --> 20:02.208
- You know what the difference
between you and me is?

20:02.250 --> 20:04.333
I'm not afraid to
do what I want.

20:04.375 --> 20:05.958
- No, the difference

20:06.000 --> 20:07.916
is I don' t wanna draw
dicks on the wall.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.583
- You couldn't come
here by yourself.

20:12.625 --> 20:14.250
You don't have the guts.

20:14.291 --> 20:16.541
You needed me so you could
come and play tourist.

20:19.208 --> 20:20.250
Shit!

20:21.291 --> 20:24.250
[tense ambient music]

20:36.458 --> 20:37.458
I don't have a torch.

20:41.875 --> 20:43.125
- Here, I ve got a spare.

20:44.791 --> 20:46.708
You know how to use it?

20:46.750 --> 20:47.500
- [Rowan] It s a torch.

20:47.541 --> 20:49.333
How hard can it be?

20:49.375 --> 20:51.333
- It s a tactical light.

20:51.375 --> 20:54.166
That's the emergency beacon,
triggered by double click.

20:54.208 --> 20:56.500
Single click, on, off.

The ring near the lamp
controls the brightness.

Low, medium and high.

Don't run it on high though.

21:04.291 --> 21:05.375
- I'll look after it.

21:08.583 --> 21:10.333
- That's your backup?

21:10.375 --> 21:12.333
- Always go prepared.

21:12.375 --> 21:14.625
- What else did they teach
you in the Girl Scouts?

21:16.375 --> 21:17.833
- Look, I don't give a fuck

21:17.875 --> 21:20.666
that you guys aren t
taking this seriously.

21:20.708 --> 21:22.083
Go fuck yourself.

- Hey!

Hey!

21:29.666 --> 21:31.458
I do take this seriously.

21:31.500 --> 21:34.458
If we get caught breaking
and entering, we go to jail.

21:34.500 --> 21:35.875
I'm not gonna get
caught, you understand?

21:35.916 --> 21:38.166
I'm not gonna let that happen.

21:38.208 --> 21:39.500
- It's not about that.

21:39.541 --> 21:41.500
It's about respect.

21:41.541 --> 21:43.000
- You're preaching to
the converted, dude.

21:43.041 --> 21:45.208
I m not the one tagging
walls and pissing in corners.

21:45.250 --> 21:46.458
- Shut up!

21:46.500 --> 21:47.583
Seriously, shut up.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.250
I think I heard something.

21:50.291 --> 21:52.541
[tense music]

21:54.416 --> 21:55.291

[thudding]

22:02.000 --> 22:03.333
- Let s just get out of here.

22:03.375 --> 22:05.541
- Yeah, I think you re right.

22:06.916 --> 22:07.791
Oh, fuck!

22:10.333 --> 22:12.000
- Whoa, sorry.

22:14.500 --> 22:15.541
Hey, listen.

22:17.375 --> 22:20.041
We don' t wanna bother you.

22:20.083 --> 22:21.125
We we're just leaving.

22:22.500 --> 22:23.541

[tense music]

22:31.583 --> 22:32.291

[Michael whimpering]

22:42.708 --> 22:43.416
Wait!

22:45.375 --> 22:46.416
Wait!

22:48.000 --> 22:49.916
Michael, come on!

22:49.958 --> 22:50.708
For fuck's sake, dude!

22:50.750 --> 22:51.666
What are you doing?

22:51.708 --> 22:53.250
- Who was, what was that?

22:53.291 --> 22:54.625
- I don't know, man.

22:54.666 --> 22:55.666
- Did you see the mask?

22:55.708 --> 22:57.166
What was with the fucking mask?

22:57.208 --> 22:58.625
- He's just a fucking prick!

22:58.666 --> 22:59.958
I'll smash that cunt!

23:00.000 --> 23:00.875
- [Michael] Why
would he do that?

23:00.916 --> 23:02.000
- I don't know.

23:02.041 --> 23:02.958
- What if we re trapped?

23:03.000 --> 23:04.166
- Michael!

23:04.208 --> 23:04.958
Calm down, okay?

23:05.000 --> 23:06.291
- Did you see the guy?

23:06.333 --> 23:07.250
He was a fucking psycho!

23:07.291 --> 23:08.833
- For fuck s sake dude!

23:08.875 --> 23:10.750
He s just some filthy
fucking junkie bum.

23:10.791 --> 23:12.500
- Rowan's right, okay?

23:13.458 --> 23:15.958
He s just a crazy bum, right?

23:18.041 --> 23:19.041
- So what do we do now?

23:19.083 --> 23:20.333
- Go and smash that cunt.

23:20.375 --> 23:22.166
- Well, why didn t you
fucking smash him then?

23:23.000 --> 23:25.041
- He had a weapon!

23:25.083 --> 23:26.625
Maybe if you hadn't
fucking pussied out,

23:26.666 --> 23:27.875
we all could've rushed him!

23:27.916 --> 23:30.833
- Just fucking calm
down, all right?

23:30.875 --> 23:33.500
Just calm down!

23:33.541 --> 23:34.500
We re just gonna
find another way out

23:34.541 --> 23:35.958
and go home, all right?

23:37.916 --> 23:39.208
We re just gonna go home.

23:40.250 --> 23:41.041
Okay?

23:42.625 --> 23:44.291
Okay.

23:44.333 --> 23:46.375
- All right, if I see that guy,

23:46.416 --> 23:48.500
I'm gonna give him
a fucking hiding!

23:48.541 --> 23:49.708
- That's great.

23:49.750 --> 23:50.541
Now let s just go.

23:53.375 --> 23:54.708
- I m telling you, man.

23:54.750 --> 23:56.083
If I see that guy
I'm gonna give him

23:56.125 --> 23:58.291
a fucking thrashing,
he ll never forget.

24:01.125 --> 24:03.500
[tense music]

24:07.500 --> 24:09.125
- What would he be doing here?

24:11.125 --> 24:12.625
Do you think he lives here?

24:12.666 --> 24:14.541
- What difference does it make?

24:14.583 --> 24:15.875
He s fucked with the wrong guy.

24:15.916 --> 24:17.125
If he s got any fucking brains,

24:17.166 --> 24:18.666
he ll stay the
hell away from me.

24:18.708 --> 24:20.208
- But why would
he be living here?

24:20.250 --> 24:23.333
- Can you stop going on
about it, for Christ s sakes?

24:47.666 --> 24:49.666
- Something smells
really bad down here.

24:51.625 --> 24:52.791
- I thought that was you.

24:54.208 --> 24:55.250
- What if it s gas?

24:56.541 --> 24:58.583
What if that s why
he s wearing the mask?

24:58.625 --> 24:59.583
- I don' t know.

25:00.916 --> 25:01.708
Maybe.

25:03.541 --> 25:06.291
[metal clanks]

25:06.333 --> 25:07.208
- What is that?

25:08.416 --> 25:10.541
[clanks]

25:12.625 --> 25:13.625
- I've had enough of this shit!

25:13.666 --> 25:15.708
- Yeah, we gotta keep moving.

25:32.500 --> 25:34.875
[tense music]

25:51.208 --> 25:52.583
- Hold on.

25:52.625 --> 25:55.666
We don' t wanna be going
down, we wanna be going up.

25:55.708 --> 25:57.291
- You ve seen how
big this place is.

25:57.333 --> 25:58.291
There's levels and levels.

25:58.333 --> 25:59.708
There's gotta be
another way out.

26:01.125 --> 26:03.750
- But we're already underground,
can t you feel that?

26:03.791 --> 26:05.750
- No, it s just another floor.

26:05.791 --> 26:07.208
Let s check it out, come on.

26:09.208 --> 26:10.000
- Fuck!

26:37.625 --> 26:38.416
Weird.

26:51.041 --> 26:53.166
What the fuck is going
on with this place?

26:55.708 --> 26:58.666
[tense ambient music]

27:01.166 --> 27:03.458
- [Michael] Where did
all this stuff come from?

27:10.250 --> 27:13.750
- Must be a dozen pairs
of shoes down here.

27:13.791 --> 27:15.250
- Let s just get
the fuck outta here.

27:17.416 --> 27:20.625
[tense ambient music]

27:34.208 --> 27:35.000
- [Rowan] Shit!

27:39.708 --> 27:41.708
- [Michael] What the
hell's up with you?

27:46.375 --> 27:47.166
- Guys!

27:58.791 --> 28:00.500
We re at the edge
of the building!

28:00.541 --> 28:01.833
- [Michael] If we
follow this edge,

28:01.875 --> 28:03.000
there ll have to be
an exit eventually.

28:04.041 --> 28:04.833
- Yep.

28:05.750 --> 28:07.333
Hey, Boy Scout!

28:07.375 --> 28:08.916
Stop dicking around
in the trash.

28:08.958 --> 28:10.416
We re getting out of here.

28:14.458 --> 28:16.666
What the fuck is he doing?

28:33.166 --> 28:33.958

28:37.458 --> 28:40.875

are you doing, man?

28:41.750 --> 28:43.666
Andre, for fuck's sake!

28:56.750 --> 28:57.791
- Guys!

28:59.625 --> 29:00.583

- Later, I promise.

[thuds]

29:58.791 --> 30:01.625
- [Michael] Fuck, that's close.

30:01.666 --> 30:03.125
- We have to hurry.

30:10.041 --> 30:10.833
Fuck!

30:17.833 --> 30:18.958
- Dead end.

- So we're fucked!

- Shit.

30:24.125 --> 30:24.833
Shit!

30:25.833 --> 30:27.083
We've got to go back.

30:27.125 --> 30:27.916
Find another way.

30:29.166 --> 30:30.958
- I say we go back
to the stairs.

Yeah and if that
motherfucker s there,

a plan, come on.

- [Rowan] Now what?

31:08.666 --> 31:09.458
- [Andre] Dunno.

- God, what s that smell?

- [Andre] Shit,
stop rubbing mate!

31:33.375 --> 31:35.375
Michael!
- Ow, what is it?

31:35.416 --> 31:36.625
Is it asbestos?

31:37.875 --> 31:38.958
It's asbestos, isn't it?

31:39.000 --> 31:40.750
- I don't know, man!

31:45.791 --> 31:46.541
Oh, fuck.

- What is it?

What's wrong?

Oh, fuck!

- Michael.

32:13.208 --> 32:16.833
- Stay the fuck away from me!

32:16.875 --> 32:19.000
- It doesn t have to be
what you think it is.

32:19.041 --> 32:19.916
It could be nothing.

32:19.958 --> 32:21.125
- Nothing?

32:21.166 --> 32:22.375
How about I stick this
fucking thing in you

32:22.416 --> 32:24.250
and we'll see if
it's still nothing!

32:24.291 --> 32:27.958
- Put it down right now or
I'll smack the shit outta you!

32:32.291 --> 32:34.125
- I need to get to a hospital.

32:35.833 --> 32:36.625
Now.

32:43.166 --> 32:46.250
- [Andre] Hey, how, many
fingers am I holding up?

32:46.291 --> 32:47.750
- How am I supposed to know

32:47.791 --> 32:49.500
if you shine that
fucking torch in my face?

32:50.416 --> 32:52.000
- Okay, good.

32:54.166 --> 32:54.916
How you feeling?

32:57.208 --> 32:58.166
- I'll be all right.

33:13.458 --> 33:15.000
- I don't think
we came this way.

33:19.041 --> 33:20.625
- This is bullshit.

33:20.666 --> 33:22.291
It s like a fucking maze.

33:23.791 --> 33:25.875
- I thought you always
knew which way was which?

33:27.583 --> 33:29.708
- You little cocksucker.

33:29.750 --> 33:31.916
This is all your fault.

33:31.958 --> 33:33.750
If you hadn't fucking run
away like a little girl,

33:33.791 --> 33:35.208
we'd be halfway home by now!

33:35.250 --> 33:36.291
- Both of you cool it!

33:36.333 --> 33:38.416
- Fucking gutless little bitch.

33:38.458 --> 33:40.041
I should leave you
to rot down here!

33:40.083 --> 33:41.166
- That's enough!

33:42.291 --> 33:45.208
[distant coughing]

33:55.041 --> 33:56.291
Who's there?

33:56.333 --> 33:57.083
- [Michael] What are you doing?

33:57.125 --> 33:59.750
[Andre hushing]

33:59.791 --> 34:01.000
- Where are you?

34:13.000 --> 34:15.375
[tense music]

34:18.083 --> 34:19.250
Jesus.

34:26.208 --> 34:27.541
- [Liam] Water.

34:47.208 --> 34:48.250
- Ease up, mate.

34:50.958 --> 34:52.958
[coughing]

34:54.208 --> 34:56.166
- [Andre] How long you
been down here for?

34:59.625 --> 35:01.333
- Have you got any food?

35:01.375 --> 35:02.750
- No, we didn t pack a picnic.

35:02.791 --> 35:04.250
Who the fuck are you?

35:08.791 --> 35:09.583
- Liam.

35:13.333 --> 35:16.166
Did you find the others?

35:16.208 --> 35:17.333
- What others?

35:18.625 --> 35:20.875
- [Liam] We got separated.

35:20.916 --> 35:23.208
- There's no one else, except.

35:24.541 --> 35:25.666
- The one in the mask.

35:27.291 --> 35:29.166
We have to stay away from him.

35:29.208 --> 35:29.958
- No shit.

35:31.125 --> 35:33.000
What the hell were
you doing down here?

35:38.958 --> 35:40.791
- You re looking for it too.

35:40.833 --> 35:43.916
- [Michael] We're just
looking for a way out.

35:43.958 --> 35:45.208
- [Liam] But you
haven t found it.

35:45.250 --> 35:47.541
- What the fuck are
you talking about?

35:47.583 --> 35:48.458
- I know where it is.

35:48.500 --> 35:50.083
- Start making sense.

35:50.125 --> 35:51.250
- Back off, man.

35:51.291 --> 35:52.500
It's not helping.

35:52.541 --> 35:54.083
- [Michael] Here, I've
got some muesli bars.

35:55.375 --> 35:57.458
Maybe we just all take
a break for a minute.

36:17.958 --> 36:22.291
- I don't know how long
I've been down here.

36:22.333 --> 36:23.291
Days.

36:24.708 --> 36:25.500
Maybe.

36:28.166 --> 36:30.708
First, the batteries ran out.

36:33.208 --> 36:34.250
Then the water.

36:35.958 --> 36:39.083
- So you re just
lucky we came along.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.208
- What about your friends?

36:45.583 --> 36:47.791
- He came out of the dark.

36:49.208 --> 36:50.333
We scattered.

36:55.916 --> 36:58.583
I heard screams
and then nothing.

37:01.791 --> 37:03.208
For a long time.

37:09.875 --> 37:11.541
And then I heard you.

37:12.666 --> 37:13.791
- [Michael] Screaming?

37:16.750 --> 37:18.750
- But we found it.

37:18.791 --> 37:19.500
- What?

37:21.333 --> 37:23.666
- Everyone who comes
here is looking for it.

37:23.708 --> 37:26.166
- Could you find it again?

37:26.208 --> 37:28.625
- Wait a second,
you knew about this?

37:29.666 --> 37:31.000
- It's just an old story.

37:32.541 --> 37:33.750
- What a joke!

37:34.708 --> 37:37.416
We ve wasted enough time.

37:37.458 --> 37:39.708
- What about the
guy in the mask?

37:39.750 --> 37:41.833
The screaming, his friends?

37:41.875 --> 37:43.916
- We can't do
anything about that.

37:43.958 --> 37:46.458
We've just gotta get out
of here and get help.

37:46.500 --> 37:48.333
- But what if he's
still out there?

38:23.416 --> 38:26.000
- Hey, wait up.

38:26.041 --> 38:27.125
We've been here before.

38:30.791 --> 38:32.916
- Ah, I don't know,
it all looks the same.

38:34.000 --> 38:34.833
- Nah, I'm sure.

38:36.791 --> 38:38.333
- So what do we do now?

38:46.458 --> 38:47.500
- Any tips, Liam?

38:55.916 --> 39:00.833
- Maybe that way?

39:02.000 --> 39:02.791
- Maybe.

39:05.750 --> 39:08.958
[tense ambient music]

39:16.041 --> 39:17.250
- Got nothing.

39:19.333 --> 39:21.416
- We re under tons of
concrete and steel.

39:25.500 --> 39:27.083
- Who you gonna call?

39:27.125 --> 39:28.250
The cops?

39:28.291 --> 39:29.041
Your mum?

39:29.083 --> 39:29.833
- I don't know.

39:29.875 --> 39:31.208
Someone, anyone.

39:31.250 --> 39:32.708
- We're on our own, Michael.

39:32.750 --> 39:34.541
We gotta do this ourselves.

39:36.041 --> 39:39.500
You re the one who
didn't wanna get caught.

39:44.125 --> 39:47.333
[tense ambient music]

39:52.458 --> 39:54.166
This is crazy.

39:54.208 --> 39:55.500
We re going around in circles.

40:00.583 --> 40:01.500
- [Michael] You sure?

40:02.416 --> 40:04.416
- Absolutely.

40:04.458 --> 40:06.833
- Fuck, let s settle this.

40:20.291 --> 40:21.791
Good thing one of us
brought something useful.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.500
- Haven't you wondered?

40:37.541 --> 40:39.458
What if he meant
for this to happen?

40:39.500 --> 40:41.583
What if he followed
us down here?

40:41.625 --> 40:42.375
- What?

40:42.416 --> 40:43.916
- The psycho!

40:43.958 --> 40:45.916
What if it's a trap?

40:45.958 --> 40:49.166
- Mate, we ve got enough to
worry about right now, okay?

40:49.208 --> 40:50.625
- Ah, fuck!

40:50.666 --> 40:51.583
Fuck!

40:52.500 --> 40:53.500
Fuck!

40:56.750 --> 40:58.375
- [Michael] Ah shit!

40:58.416 --> 41:00.750
- You ve been going
around in circles.

41:03.458 --> 41:04.958
- Check your compass.

41:05.916 --> 41:07.833
- [Andre] Always come prepared.

41:07.875 --> 41:08.791
- How's that gonna help?

41:08.833 --> 41:10.791
- At least we ll get a bearing!

41:10.833 --> 41:12.500
- [Andre] What the hell?

41:12.541 --> 41:13.541
- Hold it level.

41:13.583 --> 41:15.583
- I am holding it level!

41:15.625 --> 41:16.375
- [Liam] It s broken.

41:16.416 --> 41:17.208
- It s not broken!

41:18.208 --> 41:19.500
- It's fucked!

41:19.541 --> 41:20.791
Doesn't matter in here anyway.

41:20.833 --> 41:22.791
We're not looking for
fucking Santa Claus.

41:22.833 --> 41:25.500
- If you've got a better
idea, I'd like to hear it.

41:25.541 --> 41:27.583
- Yeah, I do.

41:27.625 --> 41:28.750
Why don' t you leave
a trail of crumbs

41:28.791 --> 41:30.666
with the cookies in
your girl guide bag?

41:30.708 --> 41:31.791
- Fuck you!

41:31.833 --> 41:32.833
- [Michael] Both of
you just back off!

41:32.875 --> 41:33.541
- I will not!

41:35.083 --> 41:37.333
Why don't you fill us in on
what's going on down here?

41:37.375 --> 41:39.541
What d you find in
the toilet block?

41:39.583 --> 41:40.875
- [Andre] It's not
gonna help us now.

41:40.916 --> 41:42.583
- [Rowan] I ll be
the judge of that.

41:44.583 --> 41:45.416
- A camera.

41:48.208 --> 41:50.666
- You knew it was here.

41:50.708 --> 41:52.375
You've been looking for
it the whole damn time.

41:52.416 --> 41:55.375
- I didn't know it was here,
I just thought it might be.

41:55.416 --> 41:56.333
- [Liam] What camera?

41:56.375 --> 41:57.583
- [Michael] Whose camera?

41:57.625 --> 42:00.416
- The guy was telling
you about, the blogger.

42:00.458 --> 42:01.500
The one who came down here.

42:01.541 --> 42:02.708
- Well what happened to him?

42:04.125 --> 42:05.666
- I dunno.

42:05.708 --> 42:09.125
The post s just stopped.

42:09.166 --> 42:10.708
- Well, what was
he doing down here?

42:10.750 --> 42:11.916
What was he looking for?

42:16.958 --> 42:17.750
- Chemicals.

42:21.041 --> 42:22.291
Industrial chemicals.

42:23.708 --> 42:24.500
Toxic waste.

42:25.708 --> 42:26.708
- Toxic waste?

42:28.916 --> 42:30.458
Why would anybody want that?

42:31.625 --> 42:32.625
- You can make stuff with it.

42:33.625 --> 42:34.750
Poisons,

42:35.541 --> 42:36.583
drugs,

42:37.708 --> 42:39.083
shit like that.

42:39.125 --> 42:41.583
- The motherfuckers
just dumped down here.

42:41.625 --> 42:43.500
- You son of a bitch.

42:43.541 --> 42:46.333
You knew about this shit and
you still brought us down here!

42:46.375 --> 42:48.625
You sold us down the river!

42:48.666 --> 42:50.458
- I didn't know this
was gonna happen.

42:51.583 --> 42:52.333
- Oh, god.

42:54.333 --> 42:55.666
- I swear.

42:56.625 --> 42:57.875
- No way out.

42:57.916 --> 42:59.416
- [Michael] What?

42:59.458 --> 43:00.708
- That's what it
said on the wall.

43:00.750 --> 43:02.250
No way out.

43:02.291 --> 43:03.833
- Andre, what is
he talking about?

43:05.458 --> 43:06.791
Andre!

43:06.833 --> 43:07.750
- We need to look
at that camera.

43:08.916 --> 43:10.166
- Nah, probably
doesn't work any way.

43:10.208 --> 43:12.125
- Well, who fucking asked you?

43:12.166 --> 43:13.416
Get the camera!

43:15.208 --> 43:16.125
- Ah, fuck!

43:25.708 --> 43:26.916
- [Rowan] Check
the last few files.

43:26.958 --> 43:28.833
- [Andre] All right, all right.

43:36.666 --> 43:37.500
- Ah shit!

43:37.541 --> 43:38.416
It's an art house movie.

43:38.458 --> 43:39.958
- Just wait.

43:40.000 --> 43:43.166
- The furnace s here had
to be fed tons of coal,

43:43.208 --> 43:43.958
around the clock.

43:45.666 --> 43:49.791
In 1951, three men died
in a coal pile collapse.

43:50.875 --> 43:52.875
Less than a year later,

43:52.916 --> 43:56.250
another man falls
into the furnaces.

43:56.291 --> 43:59.833
I'd say this place has
its fair share of ghosts.

43:59.875 --> 44:01.750
- Enough of the History
Channel already.

44:01.791 --> 44:04.291
- Can you shut your mouth
for one fucking minute?

44:14.083 --> 44:15.916
That's where we came in.

44:15.958 --> 44:17.208
- Maybe just scan ahead.

44:28.666 --> 44:30.583
Hold it there.

44:30.625 --> 44:31.833
- It all just looks the same.

44:35.791 --> 44:37.500
I don't understand.

44:39.250 --> 44:41.708
How do I keep ending up
back at the same place?

44:45.000 --> 44:46.875
And I keep hearing
these sounds, like,

44:50.125 --> 44:51.250
like shuffling,

44:55.375 --> 44:56.166
and breathing.

45:00.625 --> 45:03.500
I should never have
come here alone.

45:03.541 --> 45:04.958
[gasps]

45:05.000 --> 45:06.750
- Jesus Christ!

45:06.791 --> 45:09.000
He fucking killed him!

45:09.041 --> 45:09.958
- We re all gonna die in here.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.333
- That's enough!

45:11.375 --> 45:12.916
This is useless.

45:12.958 --> 45:14.250
We ve just got to
get out of here

45:14.291 --> 45:16.125
before the batteries die
and we end up like Liam,

45:16.166 --> 45:18.291
drinking our own
piss in the dark.

45:18.333 --> 45:20.583
- You won t be such a tough
guy when the lights go out.

45:20.625 --> 45:21.916
- Oh yeah?

45:21.958 --> 45:24.291
Well how about pulling
some fucking weight, huh?

45:24.333 --> 45:25.625
We re even more
lost because of you!

45:25.666 --> 45:27.541
- Look, this isn't helping.

45:27.583 --> 45:28.875
We ve got to work together.

45:28.916 --> 45:32.000
[Michael retching]

45:32.041 --> 45:33.833
- [Rowan] Ah, great.

45:34.833 --> 45:36.750
- Michael, I m sorry.

45:37.875 --> 45:40.625
- I need to get to a hospital.

45:40.666 --> 45:41.750
- Can you stand?

45:46.875 --> 45:48.750
- I just wanna go home.

45:48.791 --> 45:50.333
- But I'm so close.

45:50.375 --> 45:51.541
- No fucking way!

45:51.583 --> 45:53.625
- He s right,
that's just madness.

45:53.666 --> 45:54.583
We ve gotta get to the stairwell

45:54.625 --> 45:55.833
and get the hell out of here.

45:58.291 --> 45:59.666
- But--

45:59.708 --> 46:01.500
- Don' t even start
on that shit, man!

46:01.541 --> 46:02.416
We re going home.

46:05.125 --> 46:05.958
- Ah, shit!

46:07.875 --> 46:08.666
Okay.

46:10.958 --> 46:11.541
Okay.

46:12.750 --> 46:14.416
But we've got to be
smarter about this.

46:14.458 --> 46:16.833
- Oh well, you're
the smart one, right?

46:16.875 --> 46:17.875
- Look, this is a big building.

46:17.916 --> 46:20.583
We re in some sort of a loop.

46:20.625 --> 46:21.958
We just can't see it.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.916
- [Rowan] We could start
by running these brighter.

46:23.958 --> 46:26.625
- If we ran them brighter,
we'd be in the dark by now.

46:26.666 --> 46:28.833
Like I said, we
need to be smart.

46:28.875 --> 46:30.125
- Well come on, Einstein!

46:33.791 --> 46:36.291
- Okay, I've got an idea.

46:36.333 --> 46:38.166
Two of us hold this position.

46:38.208 --> 46:40.875
The other two scout ahead
and try and find a way out.

46:40.916 --> 46:43.458
We mark our progress
with a spray can.

46:43.500 --> 46:44.208
- Mark it how?

46:46.333 --> 46:47.708
- I dunno.

46:47.750 --> 46:50.333
We use numbers or an arrow.

46:52.041 --> 46:53.833
- No, I don't like it.

46:53.875 --> 46:55.250
We've got to stick together.

46:55.291 --> 46:56.291
- I know we should.

46:57.208 --> 46:59.125
It hasn't exactly worked so far.

46:59.166 --> 47:00.208
- It might work.

47:00.250 --> 47:01.500
If we mark the junctions

47:01.541 --> 47:03.000
and come back every
couple of minutes.

47:03.041 --> 47:06.041
- Yeah, if we don't
spread too far.

47:06.083 --> 47:07.500
Stay within earshot.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.416
- Well, I m not staying behind.

47:11.916 --> 47:13.708
- I'll stay.

47:13.750 --> 47:16.000
Just don't get too far ahead.

47:16.041 --> 47:17.125
- [Liam] I'll stay with you.

47:19.750 --> 47:20.458
- [Andre] Okay.

47:21.833 --> 47:26.666
- All right, back in five
minutes, whatever happens.

47:27.958 --> 47:28.875
Wanna hold hands, that
make you feel better?

47:28.916 --> 47:29.875
- Piss off.

47:33.750 --> 47:38.125
You stay here, you promise?

47:38.166 --> 47:39.083
- I promise.

47:41.541 --> 47:43.958
- [Rowan] Hurry the fuck up!

47:44.875 --> 47:45.916
- [Liam] Good luck.

47:48.208 --> 47:50.833
[tense music]

47:57.166 --> 47:58.416
- I don' t like that guy.

48:00.083 --> 48:02.791
You believe all that bullshit
about being lost down here?

48:04.166 --> 48:06.666
And what the hell happened
to his so-called friends?

48:07.958 --> 48:09.958
- [Michael] Well we re lost,

48:10.000 --> 48:12.875
so yeah I can believe that part.

48:12.916 --> 48:14.625
- [Rowan] How do
you get this to?

48:14.666 --> 48:16.500
- Andre said not to.

48:16.541 --> 48:17.500
- It s just for a minute.

48:18.916 --> 48:19.833
Looks promising.

48:23.083 --> 48:23.875
Here.

48:25.458 --> 48:26.916
Make yourself useful, will you?

48:36.500 --> 48:38.000
- Hey, wait up!

48:45.250 --> 48:46.500
- Can you find it again?

48:49.250 --> 48:50.041
- We're close.

48:52.666 --> 48:53.541
- You sure?

48:54.791 --> 48:58.125
- They wouldn t even
know we were gone.

49:02.458 --> 49:04.250
- All right, let's go.

49:06.958 --> 49:10.166
[tense ambient music]

49:25.875 --> 49:26.666
- Mark this one.

49:38.375 --> 49:39.875
- Okay, it's been five.

49:39.916 --> 49:40.791
Let s head back.

49:40.833 --> 49:42.291
- We hardly got anywhere.

49:42.333 --> 49:43.416
Just another minute.

49:43.458 --> 49:45.458
- No way, we promised.

49:45.500 --> 49:48.041
- Just around the corner and
straight back, all right?

49:52.750 --> 49:53.958
- This was a stupid idea.

49:55.791 --> 49:59.000
[tense ambient music]

50:23.125 --> 50:24.500
- This one.

50:24.541 --> 50:26.250
Doesn t smell as bad in here.

50:28.250 --> 50:31.500
- All right, but we
have to head back now.

50:54.416 --> 50:56.208
- Well where is it?

51:12.541 --> 51:15.250
- [Liam] This is
all that s left.

51:16.833 --> 51:18.166
- [Andre] What?

51:32.833 --> 51:34.291
What are you doing?

52:00.166 --> 52:00.833
- Try it.

52:12.583 --> 52:16.583
I can remember when it
used to hit me like that.

52:18.125 --> 52:20.208
It does take some
getting used to.

52:23.583 --> 52:25.875
[grunting]

52:28.208 --> 52:31.583
But you don't have
to worry about that.

52:43.166 --> 52:45.250
- Not sure how
much paint s left.

52:45.291 --> 52:46.791
- Don't worry about it.

52:46.833 --> 52:49.541
Let s just grab the Boy Scout
and get the fuck out of here.

52:49.583 --> 52:52.083
[tense music]

55:50.166 --> 55:52.333
- [Andre] No, don't, no, no!

55:54.125 --> 55:54.958
No!

55:55.000 --> 55:56.916
[thuds]

55:58.708 --> 56:01.250
[tense music]

56:15.500 --> 56:17.500
[thuds]

56:19.166 --> 56:20.583
- What was that?

56:22.500 --> 56:23.291
Andre.

56:24.458 --> 56:25.250
Come on!

56:28.041 --> 56:30.416
[tense music]

56:48.125 --> 56:48.916
This way.

57:07.625 --> 57:08.416
Andre!

57:09.875 --> 57:10.666
Andre!

57:20.625 --> 57:22.125
- [Rowan] Andre!

57:22.166 --> 57:24.000
Where the fuck are you?

57:26.041 --> 57:27.708
Quit screwing around!

57:32.708 --> 57:34.208
- [Michael] Here.

57:47.000 --> 57:47.791
- Andre!

58:03.000 --> 58:04.250
What the hell?

58:05.791 --> 58:06.583
Wait up!

58:12.125 --> 58:12.916
- Andre.

58:29.708 --> 58:30.500
Oh, no.

58:45.875 --> 58:48.083
We'll get you out of here.
