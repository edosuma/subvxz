WEBVTT

00:02.900 --> 00:05.030
Technical support. May I help you?

00:05.030 --> 00:08.970
Hi, uh, my Internet went out right in the
middle of watching Beethoven on Netflix.

00:08.970 --> 00:11.540
I need to know if that dog
gets put to sleep or not!

00:11.540 --> 00:14.110
Oh, the slobbery dog? It is most funny.

00:14.110 --> 00:16.110
My favorite is when he
steals the turkey leg

00:16.110 --> 00:17.710
- from Charles Grodin, and...
- No, no, no, no!

00:17.720 --> 00:20.030
Please don't ruin it!
Just fix my Internet.

00:20.030 --> 00:22.400
Of course, Sir. First,
power cycle the modem.

00:22.400 --> 00:24.890
Unplug the ethernet
cord and the AC adapter.

00:24.890 --> 00:26.790
Ether-dapter? What?

00:26.800 --> 00:29.260
I'm struggling with your stupid accent.

00:29.260 --> 00:30.790
What part of America are you from?

00:30.790 --> 00:33.530
My name is Mukund. I am
from Mumbai, India, Sir.

00:33.530 --> 00:36.680
Moon pie, India? Goddamn outsourcing!

00:36.680 --> 00:39.510
Stealing all our jobs,
screwing up our economy.

00:39.520 --> 00:42.350
My country is in the shitter
because of your country.

00:42.350 --> 00:46.920
This is a bunch of anti-American,
Uncle Sam-raping bullsh... oh.

00:46.920 --> 00:48.360
Oh, it's back on.

00:48.360 --> 00:51.120
Hey, uh, thanks, moonpie.
Thank you so much.

01:03.370 --> 01:07.410
Good morning, rangers. Isn't
this a glorious morning?

01:07.410 --> 01:11.050
Guys, I'm trying to heat up my tea,
but there doesn't seem to be a door.

01:11.050 --> 01:13.380
It's never had a door.
Woody said doors cost extra.

01:13.380 --> 01:17.320
It still works. You just have to
shove a wet knife in the door hole.

01:17.320 --> 01:21.560
- Uh, isn't that dangerous?
- Oh, very.

01:21.560 --> 01:23.210
Another nosebleed.

01:26.200 --> 01:29.170
- Connie! What happened?
- Woody made me neuter the wolves,

01:29.170 --> 01:32.000
but he's too cheap to
buy tranquilizer darts.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.880
Okay, who's first?

01:35.040 --> 01:36.710
That's it, we've gotta do something.

01:36.710 --> 01:39.110
Yeah, before this bitch
turn into a werewolf.

01:39.110 --> 01:42.640
No, about Woody. He's totally
exploiting us just to cut the budget.

01:42.650 --> 01:45.220
We have no health insurance,
no pension, and this is

01:45.220 --> 01:47.820
the worst employee break
room I have ever seen.

01:47.820 --> 01:49.950
What incompetent moron is our Union Rep?

01:49.950 --> 01:50.950
Steve.

01:50.950 --> 01:56.560
Hey, I'm not incompetent, and
what's so bad about this break room?

01:56.560 --> 02:01.720
He broke my dick! That
fridge goat broke my dick!

02:02.800 --> 02:07.670
Yes. Is this bearlover dot net?
Well, your website is broken.

02:07.670 --> 02:09.500
I logged on to see cute bears,

02:09.510 --> 02:12.470
but I just keep seeing
pictures of fat, hairy gay guys!

02:12.480 --> 02:16.550
- Okay, and what is your name, Sir?
- Wait. Mukund? You work here, too?

02:16.550 --> 02:19.880
Yes, Sir. I work for four
companies, 22 hours a day.

02:19.880 --> 02:23.450
22 hours a day! What a work ethic.

02:23.450 --> 02:26.390
Well, your life probably sucks,
but at least you're loaded, right?

02:26.390 --> 02:28.380
I'm not loaded, but this gun is.

02:28.380 --> 02:31.920
I am coming to you, Ganesh!

02:32.260 --> 02:35.460
Man, this guy's hilarious.

02:35.470 --> 02:37.340
Hello? Hello?

02:37.340 --> 02:42.020
- You gonna get that? Ugh!
- Mukund? Mukund?

02:42.170 --> 02:45.240
Woody, somebody left a pile
of shit on the doorstep.

02:45.240 --> 02:46.580
Ha, ha, ha.

02:46.580 --> 02:48.810
Malloy, have you seen
Denzel, Ethel, and Connie?

02:48.810 --> 02:52.580
This is gonna sting, but they're having
a secret Union meeting to replace you.

02:52.580 --> 02:57.260
That didn't sting at
all. That felt great.

02:57.750 --> 03:01.120
Man, this place is scarier than the
backside of Connie's panties on taco night.

03:01.120 --> 03:04.620
Okay, what do we need? Proper health
benefits, safer working conditions...

03:04.630 --> 03:06.460
- A-ha!
- Ah, shit!

03:06.460 --> 03:07.860
Man, you scared me!

03:07.860 --> 03:10.870
So it's true! You guys
are trying to replace me

03:10.870 --> 03:12.560
- behind my back.
- The thing is, Steve,

03:12.560 --> 03:16.370
we need leadership, and the problem
is, Woody doesn't respect you.

03:16.370 --> 03:19.470
Woody doesn't respect me? But
you guys respect me, don't you?

03:19.480 --> 03:22.280
I think you're a pussy. Mmm.

03:22.280 --> 03:25.310
I'll stand up to Woody! Let
me go to him with your demands.

03:25.320 --> 03:28.720
All I ask is for one more
shot to win back your respect.

03:28.720 --> 03:30.420
Ooh, awkward.

03:30.420 --> 03:34.490
Uh, listen, we've got the graveyard
booked for a human sacrifice at midnight.

03:34.490 --> 03:38.760
Uh, you wouldn't happen
to be a virgin, would you?

03:38.760 --> 03:41.630
Okay, yeah, I get it. I think
you made your point, thank you.

03:41.630 --> 03:45.430
And thank you for double-checking
with me. That's so sweet.

03:45.440 --> 03:47.830
What the hell do you want, Steve?

03:47.830 --> 03:51.810
Woody, as you know, I'm the
representative for the rangers here,

03:51.810 --> 03:54.110
and we have some demands we'd like met.

03:54.110 --> 03:56.830
- Demands?
- Well, maybe suggestions.

03:56.830 --> 03:58.780
Suggestions?

03:58.780 --> 04:01.030
Well, more of a wish list, actually.

04:01.030 --> 04:02.720
All right, Steve.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.490
You want to negotiate?

04:04.490 --> 04:07.190
We'll negotiate.

04:09.660 --> 04:11.060
Good news, guys.

04:11.060 --> 04:13.430
We don't have that crappy
health insurance anymore.

04:13.430 --> 04:15.460
Really? What insurance do we have now?

04:15.470 --> 04:17.860
None, but this way
we'll be more careful.

04:19.070 --> 04:20.600
Also, you know what I really hate?

04:20.600 --> 04:24.290
When you're in your groove,
rangering it up, and then boom,

04:24.290 --> 04:26.810
you get interrupted by
having to take a lunch break.

04:26.810 --> 04:28.810
So Woody's gonna get rid of those.

04:28.810 --> 04:31.810
Steve, you're a spineless turd.
You can't stand up to anyone.

04:31.810 --> 04:32.740
Yes, I can.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.500
- Sit your ass down!
- Okay.

04:34.500 --> 04:37.590
This is unacceptable, and we are
not going to put up with this.

04:37.590 --> 04:40.480
Oh, no? Then maybe I
should just replace you.

04:40.480 --> 04:43.490
Right, like you could find anyone
who would work for less than us.

04:43.490 --> 04:48.050
Funny you should say
that. I already did.

04:49.430 --> 04:50.830
- Hello, my friends.
- Hello, my friends.

04:50.830 --> 04:52.070
Thousand greetings.

04:52.070 --> 04:57.040
Ha, ha, ha! They're Skyped in from
India, and work for three bucks a day.

04:57.040 --> 04:59.840
Do they get any channels
other than Al Jazeera?

04:59.840 --> 05:01.110
So what's it gonna be?

05:01.110 --> 05:06.090
You can "A" take the deal Steve and
I agreed to, or "B" get the hell out!

05:06.090 --> 05:10.320
This is ridiculous. He can't possibly
outsource park rangers to India.

05:10.320 --> 05:12.420
- I call his bluff.
- I'm with Ethel.

05:12.420 --> 05:18.060
Hell, yeah! I'm with Ethel
and Andre the 'Gina. I quit.

05:18.860 --> 05:21.800
Steve, I am so proud of
you for quitting with us.

05:21.800 --> 05:23.970
Yeah, that took balls, Steve.

05:23.970 --> 05:26.240
Well, all for one, right?

05:26.240 --> 05:27.970
Yeah. I thought you was gonna punk out.

05:27.970 --> 05:30.410
Hey, why don't you have
anything in your box?

05:30.410 --> 05:33.540
Sorry, guys, I couldn't quit.
Could you recycle this for me?

05:33.540 --> 05:35.710
- Traitor!
- I should've known.

05:35.710 --> 05:38.420
You better be glad this flimsy
gate's here, or I'd whoop your ass.

05:38.430 --> 05:39.780
I'm with Woody, guys.

05:39.780 --> 05:43.250
I couldn't leave Brickleberry even
if I had to take a 50% pay cut!

05:43.250 --> 05:46.390
Sounds good, Steve! I'm
giving you a 50% pay cut!

05:46.390 --> 05:48.590
Thank you. Great idea, Sir.

05:48.590 --> 05:49.780
Damn it.

05:51.780 --> 05:54.780
Welcome to Brickleberry
National Park, my friends.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.900
Ow! What? I swear to
God, he asked to see it.

06:05.020 --> 06:06.240
Ow!

06:06.240 --> 06:09.670
Ooh, look at that! These
dot bots are incredible!

06:09.680 --> 06:14.050
They work hard and don't complain,
unlike those quitters you call friends.

06:14.050 --> 06:16.180
Gotta respect those
stupid assholes, though.

06:16.180 --> 06:17.420
They stuck to their guns.

06:17.420 --> 06:19.520
How 'bout me? I did
exactly what you wanted.

06:19.520 --> 06:21.090
Damn right, you did.

06:21.090 --> 06:22.860
Hey, Dottie! Two lemonades.

06:22.860 --> 06:25.620
One for me and one for my
submissive bitch, Steve.

06:25.630 --> 06:27.490
Woody, this is not gonna work out.

06:27.490 --> 06:29.650
I mean, they're robots.

06:29.650 --> 06:34.150
Here are the two
lemonades you requested.

06:37.300 --> 06:42.040
Or maybe I shouldn't
be so quick to judge.

06:42.500 --> 06:45.550
The panda's mating season
is from July to September.

06:45.560 --> 06:48.260
Yeah, eat that bamboo.

06:48.260 --> 06:50.080
Hey, keep it down.
I'm trying to watch TV.

06:50.080 --> 06:51.980
Look, Ajay, a talking bear!

06:51.990 --> 06:56.350
He is much like the Teddy Ruxpin,
a children's toy from the mid-1980s.

06:56.360 --> 06:58.990
You would simply insert
audio cassettes into his anus

06:58.990 --> 07:00.260
and he would read fables to you.

07:00.260 --> 07:03.060
Listen, you're not gonna ruin my
life with your annoying work ethic.

07:03.060 --> 07:05.030
Now loosen up, have some fun.

07:05.030 --> 07:07.730
Let's watch some Asian porn
together like gentlemen.

07:07.730 --> 07:12.950
Pandas don't do it for
us. Do you have any cows?

07:13.470 --> 07:15.840
I can't believe Steve did this to us.

07:15.840 --> 07:18.040
It's okay, Connie. We'll
just find new jobs here.

07:18.040 --> 07:19.410
In this inbred, hick town?

07:19.410 --> 07:22.280
I take offense to that. I is the Mayor.

07:22.280 --> 07:23.850
Now I is the Mayor.

07:23.850 --> 07:27.440
You better gimme back
my goddamn Mayor hat!

07:27.440 --> 07:29.020
Politics.

07:29.020 --> 07:31.990
What's more offensive to you?
9/11 jokes or 7-Eleven jokes?

07:31.990 --> 07:32.990
Mm?

07:32.990 --> 07:34.490
Hey, Steve, check this out.

07:34.490 --> 07:36.430
I think I've seen your
mother. She's bow-legged

07:36.430 --> 07:39.160
from your fat head
coming through her wagina.

07:39.170 --> 07:43.500
Nice. If either one of us
had hands, I'd high-five you.

07:43.500 --> 07:47.210
Mr. Steve, I can't believe
they disrespect you like that.

07:47.210 --> 07:49.470
Ah, it's okay. They're my buddies.

07:49.470 --> 07:52.240
- I'm not your buddy, dick hole!
- Eh, me neither, dick hole!

07:52.250 --> 07:53.950
Uh, you're Dottie, right?

07:53.950 --> 07:57.730
Actually, my name is Rakshapani.

07:58.350 --> 07:59.650
Oh, uh, I'm Steve.

07:59.650 --> 08:03.760
I know. You are the top
ranger here at Brickleberry.

08:03.760 --> 08:06.020
Really? You know what?

08:06.030 --> 08:11.430
We should grab dinner some
time, rock... shit... pony.

08:12.470 --> 08:14.530
We've looked everywhere.

08:14.530 --> 08:16.970
There's no job openings in this town.

08:16.970 --> 08:21.570
- This place looks promising.
- Ethel, I think that's a titty bar.

08:21.570 --> 08:23.580
- I don't know if we should...
- Yeah!

08:23.580 --> 08:26.940
Tit-ty bar! Tit-ty bar!

08:36.590 --> 08:39.410
Come in, come in!

08:39.860 --> 08:42.190
Jesus, this business
is getting so stale.

08:42.200 --> 08:43.430
What do you want?

08:43.430 --> 08:45.290
What do we have here?

08:45.290 --> 08:48.530
You! You're the world's
next stripping sensation!

08:48.530 --> 08:51.930
Well, guys, this is a...
this is a tough decision,

08:51.930 --> 08:55.870
but I'm going to do it. I'm
gonna do it for all of us.

08:55.880 --> 08:59.980
Okay, Sir, I will agree to
expose my perfect body for money.

08:59.980 --> 09:03.020
Not you, skinny tits. There's
a million just like you.

09:03.020 --> 09:05.350
I'm talking about her!

09:05.350 --> 09:06.720
- Me?
- Her?

09:06.720 --> 09:08.600
- You blind, right?
- Shut your face!

09:08.600 --> 09:11.300
My whole career I've
been looking for an act

09:11.300 --> 09:14.930
so unconventional that it
will shake up the industry.

09:14.930 --> 09:18.850
I've got big plans. I'm
going to make you a star!

09:18.850 --> 09:20.610
Mm, I don't know, Mister.

09:20.610 --> 09:24.260
It's Jorge. Come on! I'll
even hire these two freaks.

09:24.260 --> 09:26.540
- Okay, I'll do it.
- Yes!

09:26.540 --> 09:29.940
You'll be our new DJ, and you
can mop up the peep booths.

09:29.940 --> 09:31.940
- What?
- Man. I hate DJ-ing.

09:31.950 --> 09:33.460
- You want to switch jobs?
- Really?

09:33.460 --> 09:38.350
Hell, no! I love DJ-ing. Have
fun mopping up that semen.

09:38.350 --> 09:41.250
Aw, you guys are working again.

09:41.250 --> 09:47.150
Come on, put him down. I've got
a really important job for you.

09:51.560 --> 09:54.430
Now, if one of you
could rape the other one,

09:54.430 --> 09:57.500
this would be just like game of thrones.

09:57.500 --> 10:01.870
And that is why Jesus could beat
Gandhi in mixed martial arts.

10:01.870 --> 10:05.310
Oh, Steve, you know so
much about everything.

10:05.310 --> 10:08.490
I hope to one day become
a great ranger like you.

10:08.490 --> 10:13.520
True, I am a great ranger, but I'm...
I, uh, let my friends down recently.

10:13.520 --> 10:15.620
I'm sure you did everything you could.

10:15.620 --> 10:17.270
You're a good man, Steve.

10:17.270 --> 10:22.370
Oh, rock shit pony. I
love how you just get me.

10:54.350 --> 10:59.390
Usually I hate foreigners, I'm gonna
be honest, but you guys I hate way less.

10:59.390 --> 11:03.590
This has been very much fun.
Unfortunately, we must get back to work.

11:03.590 --> 11:05.670
Back to work at this hour? Come on!

11:05.670 --> 11:09.240
Mr. Woody has advised me we do
not get time off to sleep even.

11:09.250 --> 11:11.570
- Well, don't listen to him.
- How do you don't listen?

11:11.570 --> 11:13.870
See, here in America, the only person

11:13.870 --> 11:16.700
you should take orders from
are your friends, like me.

11:16.710 --> 11:19.860
When your boss tells you to do
something, it's just a suggestion.

11:19.870 --> 11:23.540
The goal should be to do as
little work as humanly possible.

11:23.550 --> 11:28.250
Really? What else should
we know about America?

11:28.250 --> 11:32.100
I cannot believe we are at
a real American strip party.

11:32.100 --> 11:35.590
I know. I will now produce precipitation

11:35.590 --> 11:39.530
using this low-denominational currency.

11:39.530 --> 11:43.400
So, mahogany man. Are you
ready to introduce the girls?

11:43.400 --> 11:46.400
Yeah. I took it upon myself
to do a little research.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.770
Hey, y'all, it's your boy, Dirty D,

11:48.770 --> 11:51.470
the only DJ that tells
it like it really is.

11:51.470 --> 11:53.970
Up next to the stage is a hot young lady

11:53.980 --> 11:56.640
who was sexually abused by
her special needs brother.

11:56.650 --> 11:59.480
She blamed herself and
picked up a nasty meth habit.

11:59.480 --> 12:01.720
Please, show her some
love and maybe she won't

12:01.720 --> 12:07.620
cry herself to sleep tonight.
Welcome Kandy to the main stage!

12:09.260 --> 12:12.060
There you are! Woody is pissed.

12:12.060 --> 12:13.290
You guys should be at work!

12:13.290 --> 12:15.600
Hey, lard face, we are in America now.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.970
This is how the game is played.

12:17.970 --> 12:21.200
Yes, it's time to be
lazy, wear the Levi,

12:21.200 --> 12:24.640
eat the french fry, and see the titty.

12:24.640 --> 12:26.440
Oh.

12:26.510 --> 12:28.780
Hey, Ethel. What are you doing here?

12:28.780 --> 12:32.710
My new job, the official mayonnaise
mopper thanks to you, Steve.

12:32.710 --> 12:35.020
This'll look great on my resume.

12:35.020 --> 12:36.620
It's not that bad of a gig.

12:36.620 --> 12:39.050
Hey. Ethel! I need you
in the champagne room!

12:39.050 --> 12:41.790
It looks like a pinkberry
exploded in there!

12:41.790 --> 12:43.660
Up next is Crystal.

12:43.660 --> 12:45.890
She'll be shakin' that
ass to buy baby formula.

12:45.890 --> 12:50.830
She's on probation for stealin' Huggies
and she lives in a 1980 Monte Carlo!

12:50.830 --> 12:54.900
The only thing lower than her
hourly rates is her self-esteem.

12:54.900 --> 12:59.040
So let's get rock hard for Crystal!

13:08.150 --> 13:10.450
All right, Ajay. I got
50 on Mohindernanthan.

13:10.450 --> 13:14.020
What in the hell is going on?
You're not even allowed in here!

13:14.020 --> 13:15.640
We do the ping pong with the bear.

13:15.640 --> 13:18.060
I thought I told you to drag
that trash into the lake!

13:18.060 --> 13:19.750
We did not feel like it.

13:19.750 --> 13:22.060
Didn't f... you robots are dead meat!

13:22.060 --> 13:24.870
I am doubling your work! The
work that you are doing now,

13:24.870 --> 13:27.770
your going to be doing twice
as much of it! Doubling!

13:27.770 --> 13:31.490
You ever heard of that, ra...?

13:38.110 --> 13:39.970
Mmm.

13:40.580 --> 13:42.420
Mmm.

13:42.420 --> 13:44.380
Whoa! What the hell
are you doing, Steve?

13:44.390 --> 13:45.820
This is even weird for you.

13:45.820 --> 13:47.050
Woody, I, uh...

13:47.060 --> 13:50.420
Steve you cannot have
sex with the robots!

13:50.420 --> 13:53.430
She needs to be working. I don't
want you to see her anymore.

13:53.430 --> 13:56.860
- But, Sir...
- I'll handle this, Dottie.

13:56.870 --> 13:58.940
Whatever you say, Woody.
I won't see her anymore.

13:58.940 --> 14:01.230
What? What are you doing, Steve?

14:01.230 --> 14:04.360
Sorry, Dottie. You heard what he said.

14:04.370 --> 14:07.610
In love with a robot. Steve,
you stupid son of a bitch.

14:07.610 --> 14:10.380
No wonder your friends
don't respect you.

14:10.380 --> 14:14.220
You don't even respect yourself.

14:21.020 --> 14:24.320
Dottie. Look, I'm sorry.

14:25.020 --> 14:28.030
What! Who are you?
Where's rock shit pony?

14:28.030 --> 14:29.510
Oh, Rakshapani's dead.

14:29.510 --> 14:31.360
- What?
- No, no, no, no, no.

14:31.360 --> 14:34.160
Rakshapani was raped by a wizard.

14:34.170 --> 14:36.990
- What?
- I mean she quit.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.980
Sorry.

14:39.870 --> 14:42.540
All right, Denzel. Connie's next.

14:42.540 --> 14:45.110
Give our star a proper intro!

14:45.110 --> 14:46.980
Next up, guys, we have something

14:46.980 --> 14:50.780
I'm sure you've never seen
before and never wanted to.

14:50.780 --> 14:54.020
A plus-size lesbian, with abnormal
enlargement of the clitoris.

14:54.020 --> 14:55.350
Give me that!

14:55.350 --> 14:59.630
Are you ready for the most unique
new talent you've ever seen, guys?

14:59.630 --> 15:04.760
Please welcome the world's
newest stripping legend, Con-nie!

15:04.760 --> 15:06.920
Go! Yes!

15:11.440 --> 15:14.620
What the hell is that?

15:37.290 --> 15:41.270
Yes, they love you!
Show them the 7-10 split!

15:47.950 --> 15:52.150
Connie! Connie! Connie! Connie! Connie!

15:52.620 --> 15:56.820
Connie! Connie! Connie! Connie! Connie!

16:12.830 --> 16:16.130
Hey, hey! Wait a minute!

16:17.400 --> 16:19.900
Skinny tits, where the
hell shit is Connie?

16:19.900 --> 16:23.080
She's missing practice.

16:24.010 --> 16:26.610
- Uh, where do you think you're going?
- I need to see Connie.

16:26.610 --> 16:28.010
You got an appointment?

16:28.010 --> 16:30.050
Hey, you don't have an appointment.

16:30.050 --> 16:32.880
Here's the peeled grapes you asked for.

16:32.880 --> 16:34.020
Feed me.

16:34.020 --> 16:36.970
All right, don't you think you're
taking this diva stuff a little too far?

16:36.970 --> 16:38.430
It's not like you.

16:38.440 --> 16:40.240
Jorge said you blew off practice again?

16:40.240 --> 16:43.310
I don't have time for
that. I'm a Goddess,

16:43.310 --> 16:47.080
not a plain girl like you.
I deserve star treatment.

16:47.080 --> 16:49.010
- I can't believe...
- Feed me!

16:49.020 --> 16:52.420
We want Connie! We want Connie!

16:52.420 --> 16:55.750
Connie, what are you doing? It's
time to go on. Your fans await.

16:55.760 --> 16:57.520
Even the Mayor is here
with his Mayor hat.

16:57.520 --> 16:59.840
I'll go on when I feel like it!

16:59.840 --> 17:03.000
What happen to you? You get
too big for your britches!

17:03.000 --> 17:06.800
You don't practice, your cooch-hoop
has become loose and undisciplined.

17:06.800 --> 17:09.430
You get down on your knees and beg me.

17:09.440 --> 17:11.870
Fak ju! I don't beg for anybody!

17:11.870 --> 17:13.940
Okay, I beg. Come on, Connie, please.

17:13.940 --> 17:17.060
Please, Connie, please.

17:17.740 --> 17:20.440
Hit me! Hit me!

17:36.500 --> 17:39.980
Hey! That was just a joke.

17:40.120 --> 17:41.380
Let her try again.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.910
Yeah, so if I stretch real far...

17:47.910 --> 17:52.510
If I stretch as far as I can, I can
just touch the helmet with my tongue.

17:52.510 --> 17:54.810
Uh, Steve. I'm actually
happy to see you.

17:54.810 --> 17:57.080
Hey, Woody, can I talk to you for...

17:57.080 --> 17:59.350
Yeah, thanks to outsourcing, Steve,

17:59.350 --> 18:01.620
Brickleberry's budget
is back in the black.

18:01.620 --> 18:03.720
Check it out. Look at
all the money we saved.

18:03.720 --> 18:06.730
- How much did that bulletin board cost?
- All the money we saved.

18:06.730 --> 18:08.930
Look, Woody, I need some time off.

18:08.930 --> 18:11.660
I'm flying to India to get
back the love of my life.

18:11.670 --> 18:15.170
Hold on. Uh, Woody was just telling
me how he tried to suck himself,

18:15.170 --> 18:17.550
and somehow you still win most pathetic.

18:17.550 --> 18:20.770
They will be no time off,
and that's final! Get to work!

18:20.770 --> 18:23.230
I understand.

18:25.430 --> 18:26.500
No.

18:29.100 --> 18:31.100
What did you say, Steve?

18:31.100 --> 18:34.070
I said no. Not this time.

18:34.070 --> 18:37.450
You're not gonna push me
around. I'm not backing down!

18:37.450 --> 18:39.190
- What?
- Yeah.

18:39.190 --> 18:42.090
I'm going to India to
get rock shit pony back.

18:42.090 --> 18:45.660
I love her and that's what I'm going
to do, whether you like it or not.

18:45.660 --> 18:47.530
Well then, Steve, you're...

18:47.530 --> 18:50.900
Fired? Good. You treat me like garbage.

18:50.900 --> 18:54.230
You can run this place on your own.
I should've left when the others did.

18:54.230 --> 18:59.210
Now, if you'll excuse
me, I'm going to India!

19:05.210 --> 19:07.080
Rock shit pony?

19:07.080 --> 19:09.060
Steve?

19:14.980 --> 19:19.220
I'm sorry, guys. I guess
I should've practiced more.

19:19.220 --> 19:21.990
I got lazy and let it all go to my head.

19:21.990 --> 19:24.430
Ha, looks like you let some
of it go to your ass, too!

19:24.430 --> 19:25.590
It's okay, Connie.

19:25.590 --> 19:28.530
You. You ruined me!

19:28.700 --> 19:31.400
That vagina could have been
bigger than the Beatles!

19:31.400 --> 19:34.370
Too bad it's attached to an egomaniac!

19:34.370 --> 19:36.740
Get out! You're fired!

19:36.740 --> 19:40.210
Take the brown one and the
walking stick with tits with you!

19:40.210 --> 19:43.690
Well, a compliment, finally!

19:49.590 --> 19:51.520
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

19:51.520 --> 19:54.420
We are just stealing from work.
That is what Americans do, yes?

19:54.420 --> 19:57.590
Yes Mohindernanthan. We are entitled.

19:57.590 --> 20:01.970
My bulletin board! That
is it! You're all fired!

20:01.970 --> 20:05.960
I'm calling your company right now.

20:05.970 --> 20:08.370
Outsourcing of India,
how may I help you?

20:08.370 --> 20:12.020
What? I can't understand you!
Let me speak to an Indian!

20:12.020 --> 20:14.860
Ah. So sorry, but entire
customer service department

20:14.860 --> 20:17.470
has been outsourced to south Korea.

20:17.470 --> 20:20.170
Ugh! Goddamn it!

20:23.100 --> 20:24.970
All right, I stand corrected.

20:24.970 --> 20:28.010
Those turban-ators were
even worse than you.

20:28.010 --> 20:31.010
Steve convinced me to give
you your old jobs back.

20:31.010 --> 20:34.550
At full pay, with better health
benefits, and safer working conditions.

20:34.550 --> 20:36.110
And I get a three hour work day.

20:36.110 --> 20:37.400
- Fine!
- Week.

20:37.400 --> 20:38.380
- Fine!
- Month.

20:38.380 --> 20:41.550
- Whatever! Just get back to work.
- Ugh! You hired them back?

20:41.550 --> 20:43.120
What happened to my robots?

20:43.120 --> 20:46.600
Don't worry about them. Some
stupid ass will hire 'em.

20:50.800 --> 20:53.300
I (Bleep) Love...

20:53.420 --> 20:54.970
America!
