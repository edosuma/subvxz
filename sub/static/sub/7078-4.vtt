WEBVTT

00:01.899 --> 00:04.316
Well, that was
a weird afternoon.

00:04.350 --> 00:07.953
I guess I knew Pierce was part
of a weird, futuristic cult,

00:07.987 --> 00:11.456
but I wasn't prepared
for a funeral with so much beeping.

00:11.490 --> 00:12.958
Well, let's not judge.

00:12.992 --> 00:17.295
Everyone has a right to whatever fake
religion they delusionally choose.

00:17.330 --> 00:20.034
Abed, you were by the coffin
for a long time.

00:20.035 --> 00:23.027
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay. Although...

00:23.920 --> 00:26.004
♪ Troy and Abed
are in mourning ♪

00:26.005 --> 00:27.445
Will you guys
please stop doing that?

00:27.446 --> 00:29.539
I can't believe you did it
during your eulogy.

00:29.540 --> 00:31.343
So uncomfortable.

00:31.377 --> 00:34.179
I don't think the audience got that we
were singing "mourning" with a "u".

00:34.213 --> 00:36.214
You were singing
"mourning" with a "u"?

00:36.495 --> 00:37.878
Oh, no.

00:37.929 --> 00:40.848
I still don't fully understand
the laser lotus theology.

00:40.882 --> 00:44.101
So Pierce's body is in the coffin,
and we buried it,

00:44.135 --> 00:47.555
but this energon pod
contains his life... vapor?

00:47.556 --> 00:48.973
Yeah, it's all right here

00:48.974 --> 00:51.060
in this incredibly persuasive
literature they passed out.

00:51.061 --> 00:54.562
Once you reach level 16,
you can see the color blurble.

00:54.613 --> 00:56.197
Of all the ridiculous
cartoon nonsense.

00:56.231 --> 00:58.616
If there is a blurble, the Lord
keeps it hidden for a reason.

00:58.650 --> 01:02.369
What up, N-Bombs?
How was the funeral? Awesome?

01:02.404 --> 01:05.372
No, Chang, our friend's
funeral was not awesome.

01:05.407 --> 01:08.108
It was deeply sad.
You know, funeral style.

01:08.143 --> 01:10.544
Excuse me.
I thought you guys hated Pierce.

01:11.821 --> 01:13.430
- We did not hate Pierce.
- Craziness.

01:13.431 --> 01:14.905
All right,
are you sure you guys aren't

01:14.906 --> 01:17.468
just doing the
"respect the dead" jig-a-lig?

01:17.502 --> 01:19.803
I think you have us mistaken
for you, Chang.

01:19.838 --> 01:24.558
I don't know. I definitely remember
you complaining about him a lot.

01:24.593 --> 01:27.428
We complained about him when
he was alive. This is different.

01:27.479 --> 01:29.196
Can't believe we'll never
see him again.

01:29.231 --> 01:31.131
Just a reminder you gotta live
life to the fullest.

01:31.166 --> 01:35.319
By the time Pierce was my age, he had
already been fired from 15 jobs.

01:35.353 --> 01:38.072
I've only seen two
<i>Police Academies.</i>

01:38.073 --> 01:39.535
The last two.

01:39.536 --> 01:42.139
Well, he's gone too soon
but won't be soon forgotten.

01:42.140 --> 01:44.778
I would say you're
quite correct, Mr. Winger.

01:44.829 --> 01:47.248
- Who the hell are you?
- My name is Mr. Stone.

01:47.282 --> 01:49.566
That's easy for you to say.

01:49.584 --> 01:53.037
- And for us to say.
- I work for Mr. Hawthorne.

01:53.071 --> 01:56.090
He specified in his will that
no matter how natural in appearance

01:56.124 --> 01:57.958
the circumstances
of his death,

01:58.009 --> 02:00.177
a private inquest
should be conducted

02:00.211 --> 02:01.912
to determine
whether any one of you,

02:01.930 --> 02:04.835
his former study group,
murdered him.

02:04.836 --> 02:06.016
What?

02:06.017 --> 02:08.519
To be cleared, you must all
submit to a polygraph test.

02:08.553 --> 02:12.756
Aw, schnizzle.
You guys are in trouble!

02:12.774 --> 02:15.609
- Later.
- Mr. Chang, I presume.

02:15.644 --> 02:18.646
You're also listed as a suspect
and requested to participate.

02:18.697 --> 02:22.032
- Fine, but I ask the questions.
- I'm afraid I can't allow that.

02:22.067 --> 02:24.974
All right,
then just the "fine" part.

02:27.238 --> 02:30.790
- We're losing Pierce!
- Everyone, quickly!

02:34.679 --> 02:36.964
Someone get a balloon.

Season 5, Episode 4
"Cooperative Polygraphy"

02:59.878 --> 03:02.878
Synced by Reef
www.addic7ed.com

03:03.387 --> 03:06.900
I always wanted to try a polygraph.
They're like the pie fight of cop movies.

03:06.901 --> 03:08.912
Or the acupuncture
of the legal system.

03:08.947 --> 03:11.332
I can't believe Pierce
would think we might murder him.

03:11.344 --> 03:14.368
Yeah, what a waste of murder.
I mean, he was, like, 79.

03:14.369 --> 03:17.454
I don't suppose anyone wants
to know I consider this a violation.

03:17.539 --> 03:20.507
Come on, it's just Pierce being Pierce.
It's his final wish.

03:20.542 --> 03:22.343
If I had a final wish,
I'd use it to stay alive.

03:22.344 --> 03:24.294
Let's do it.
How do we begin?

03:24.295 --> 03:26.045
We're to start
with miss Perry.

03:26.060 --> 03:27.927
- State your name.
- Britta Perry.

03:27.928 --> 03:30.433
Have you ever had any thoughts
of violence towards Pierce Hawthorne?

03:30.435 --> 03:31.769
- No.
- Lie.

03:31.770 --> 03:35.747
I mean, I may have wanted to slap him
now and again, but I didn't kill him.

03:35.748 --> 03:37.641
In all your sexual fantasies
about Pierce Hawthorne,

03:37.675 --> 03:39.026
none of them involved
his murder?

03:39.027 --> 03:40.244
What? No.

03:40.245 --> 03:42.563
But you have had sexual fantasies
about Mr. Hawthorne.

03:42.614 --> 03:44.514
No! What kind of question
is that?

03:44.532 --> 03:45.733
I'm asking the questions

03:45.767 --> 03:48.569
just as Mr. Hawthorne wrote
them down, I assure you.

03:48.620 --> 03:51.388
- Mr. Winger, state your name.
- Jeffrey Winger.

03:51.423 --> 03:52.573
- Are you gay?
- No.

03:52.574 --> 03:54.149
- Are you sure you're not gay?
- Yes.

03:54.150 --> 03:55.601
- Gay murderer says what?
- What?

03:55.602 --> 03:56.719
He's telling the truth.

03:56.720 --> 03:58.795
I've been instructed to point out
that that means you're gay.

03:58.796 --> 04:00.013
- Ms. Bennett.
- Hmm?

04:00.014 --> 04:01.580
- State your name.
- Shirley Bennett.

04:01.583 --> 04:03.050
Are you a dishonest person?

04:03.084 --> 04:04.802
- No.
- She thinks that's true.

04:04.836 --> 04:06.470
Uh, you could have
just said no.

04:06.504 --> 04:07.971
I'm watching you
acting scientific

04:08.006 --> 04:09.740
and then adding your little 2¢
every now and again.

04:09.774 --> 04:11.592
Huh?
Continue.

04:11.643 --> 04:13.310
Is it true that you're
a platinum level donor

04:13.344 --> 04:16.329
with the pro-life organization
prenatalpatriots.org?

04:16.355 --> 04:18.055
- What?
- Keep it cool, girls.

04:18.099 --> 04:20.500
It's my money.
It's my choice.

04:20.535 --> 04:22.453
Yeah, well, if I wanted
the Government in my uterus,

04:22.487 --> 04:24.721
I'd fill it with oil
and hispanic voters.

04:24.739 --> 04:27.224
Keep it frosty, ladies.
Don't let your goats get gotched.

04:27.242 --> 04:30.577
- Mr. Barnes, state your name.
- Troy Barnes.

04:30.612 --> 04:32.633
D'oh!
I meant to say, "butts Carlton."

04:32.634 --> 04:34.331
He did mean to say,
"Butts Carlton."

04:34.365 --> 04:35.978
She said it.

04:35.979 --> 04:39.453
Did you get angry when Mr. Hawthorne
told you Fat Albert died of diabetes?

04:39.504 --> 04:41.422
Yes, like any American would.

04:41.456 --> 04:43.090
- Angry enough to murder him?
- No.

04:43.124 --> 04:46.343
Is it true that you and Abed Nadir
have an elaborate doomsday escape plan

04:46.377 --> 04:49.240
to be used in the event
of zombie attacks?

04:49.255 --> 04:52.349
We may have a designated
rendezvous point

04:52.383 --> 04:56.053
and a couple of bugout bags
filled with gold coins and condoms

04:56.087 --> 04:58.872
just in case we need to bargain
our way onto a boat.

04:58.907 --> 05:00.274
The gold coins
are for buying food.

05:00.308 --> 05:04.142
Does your doomsday plan account for
the welfare of any of your other friends?

05:05.146 --> 05:06.930
- Pass.
- Answer the question.

05:06.948 --> 05:09.116
- No.
- Troy! Rude!

05:09.150 --> 05:11.452
It's a doomsday plan,
not a picnic plan.

05:11.486 --> 05:12.825
Do you really wanna see
the horrors

05:12.826 --> 05:15.105
we might have to endure
just to get on a boat?

05:15.123 --> 05:16.490
- I guess not.
- That's a lie.

05:16.524 --> 05:18.375
- Ah!
- He's doing it again.

05:18.409 --> 05:21.662
- Pierce is doing it again.
- Mr. Chang, state your name.

05:21.713 --> 05:25.149
Benjamin Franklin Chang,
ready to deal out the truth.

05:25.183 --> 05:28.135
Nothing to hide.
Let's do this.

05:28.169 --> 05:30.850
Have you ever masturbated
in the study room?

05:33.624 --> 05:36.426
- Mr. Nadir, state your name.
- Abed Nadir.

05:36.460 --> 05:38.395
Have you ever 9/11'd anyone?

05:38.429 --> 05:39.680
- Nope.
- When you were a child,

05:39.731 --> 05:41.648
did you ever kill a squirrel
with a slingshot

05:41.683 --> 05:43.100
and was surprised
that you felt nothing

05:43.134 --> 05:46.200
and wondered if you were capable
of doing it to a human?

05:48.089 --> 05:49.679
No.

05:51.642 --> 05:55.162
Do you and Troy still actively use Jeff's
Netflix account without his permission?

05:55.196 --> 05:57.030
- Wait, what?
- You told Pierce that?

05:57.072 --> 05:59.273
You logged in at our place and
never logged out, so we use it.

05:59.300 --> 06:02.035
Is that why my review of <i>The Grey</i>
is constantly changing?

06:02.086 --> 06:04.616
- Yes, stop giving it four stars.
- I like Liam Neeson!

06:04.617 --> 06:06.123
Then send him a message about
the roles he chooses.

06:06.124 --> 06:08.342
Look, this is not the issue!
You're stealing from me!

06:08.376 --> 06:11.128
And as your roommate,
you're making me an accomplice.

06:11.162 --> 06:12.546
- I had no idea.
- Lie.

06:12.597 --> 06:14.348
Why would I even try that?

06:14.382 --> 06:16.934
- State your name please, Miss.
- Annie Edison.

06:16.968 --> 06:19.086
Miss Edison, did you use
your exceptional intelligence

06:19.120 --> 06:22.750
and organizational skills to plot
the foolproof murder of Pierce Hawthorne?

06:22.751 --> 06:24.852
Aww!
And no.

06:25.109 --> 06:28.369
Is it true that you overcharged Troy
and Abed for their share of the rent?

06:29.047 --> 06:31.465
- Pierce!
- Annie?

06:31.499 --> 06:35.702
Yes, but for a good reason.
You guys know you're bad with money.

06:35.737 --> 06:37.704
I padded your share
of the rent by $10

06:37.739 --> 06:40.908
and I've been putting it into
a savings account that yields 4%.

06:40.959 --> 06:44.795
You'll be thanking me in six years
when you find out you have $86.

06:44.829 --> 06:47.581
- That's jacket money.
- Oh, did you hear that, Abed?

06:47.632 --> 06:49.917
We've been washing paper plates
and making our own toothpaste.

06:49.968 --> 06:51.201
But don't you worry.

06:51.219 --> 06:53.921
When we have robot bodies on the moon,
we can share a free jacket.

06:53.934 --> 06:56.065
Annie, you should know better
than to horde money.

06:56.090 --> 06:57.224
That's a stereotype.

06:57.258 --> 07:00.894
- Was that anti-semitism?
- No! That's sensitivity.

07:00.929 --> 07:04.514
It's anti-semitic to do things like that
when you know full well you're Jewish.

07:04.548 --> 07:05.999
- Whoa.
- We could have bought a tire

07:06.034 --> 07:07.768
for our tire swing
with that money.

07:07.819 --> 07:09.219
Or your own Netflix account?

07:09.237 --> 07:11.890
- Liam Neeson? Not that great.
- Your rating system is flawed.

07:14.826 --> 07:17.087
All right!

07:18.017 --> 07:20.948
- Let's begin.
- Wait, wait.

07:20.999 --> 07:22.499
What do you mean, "begin"?

07:22.533 --> 07:24.585
That completes the calibration
round of questioning.

07:24.619 --> 07:26.119
We're ready to begin
the formal inquest.

07:26.170 --> 07:28.789
I think we're ready to end.
We've humored this long enough.

07:28.840 --> 07:31.041
Jeff... It's for Pierce.

07:31.075 --> 07:33.710
Look, respect for the dead
is only a thing

07:33.744 --> 07:36.430
because the dead usually
don't do any more damage.

07:36.464 --> 07:37.598
- Ah.
- That's true.

07:37.632 --> 07:39.466
You can quit any time
you like.

07:39.517 --> 07:41.501
But it should be noted
that Mr. Hawthorne's estate

07:41.536 --> 07:43.086
is worth over $20 million

07:43.104 --> 07:46.523
and only those cleared of his murder
can receive their bequeathments.

07:46.557 --> 07:48.740
I'm only gonna say this once.

07:48.842 --> 07:50.615
Clearly, Pierce is trying
to lure us

07:50.616 --> 07:54.214
into a labyrinth of emotional
manipulation and strategic instigation.

07:54.249 --> 07:57.734
And I think we're all smart enough to know
we should quit while we're not ahead.

07:57.768 --> 07:59.403
- I do believe we should...
- Yes, definitely.

07:59.437 --> 08:00.904
- Quit while we're ahead.
- Absolutely.

08:00.938 --> 08:03.006
- Yep.
- They're all lying.

08:03.041 --> 08:05.492
We all know that,
you judgmental bitch!

08:11.264 --> 08:13.578
Miss Perry, have you ever
eaten at the sandwich shop

08:13.579 --> 08:15.712
started by Mrs. Bennet
and Mr. Hawthorne?

08:15.713 --> 08:16.865
Yes.

08:16.871 --> 08:18.900
And what sandwich would you
order from Shirley's Sandwiches?

08:18.901 --> 08:21.269
The only one I can,
the Helen of Soy with no mayo.

08:21.270 --> 08:22.646
- Helen of Soy.
- Are you aware that,

08:22.647 --> 08:25.523
in order to save money,
Shirley stopped using real tofu

08:25.558 --> 08:29.994
and replaced it with a midwestern
tofu substitute called "meatfu"?

08:30.029 --> 08:34.698
- Oh, my God! Oh!
- It's still not actually meat... Legally.

08:34.732 --> 08:38.169
You have never respected
anything that I hold sacred!

08:38.203 --> 08:39.871
- I'm sorry!
- Shirley, did you know

08:39.922 --> 08:42.967
that Britta was high on
marijuana at your son's baptism?

08:43.241 --> 08:44.709
I'm sorry?

08:44.710 --> 08:47.336
- Well, no higher than usual.
- Not true.

08:47.390 --> 08:49.591
You did drugs in my church?

08:49.642 --> 08:51.893
No, I did drugs in
the parking lot of your church.

08:51.928 --> 08:54.930
How else do you expect somebody
to sit through something like that?

08:54.931 --> 08:57.315
At least with a bris there's
an element of suspense.

08:57.316 --> 09:00.014
Well, next time, I'll have
Cheech and Chong do the warm-up!

09:00.015 --> 09:03.705
Guys, these questions are obviously
designed to turn us against each other.

09:03.740 --> 09:05.557
If we want to beat Pierce
at his game,

09:05.575 --> 09:08.243
we have to own up to our
mistakes and forgive each other.

09:08.250 --> 09:11.294
Mr. Winger, is it true that you keep
trophies of your sexual conquests?

09:12.220 --> 09:15.250
In a church, Britta?
For shame.

09:15.334 --> 09:19.529
- It's where Jesus gets his mail.
- Answer the question, <i>Adrian Grody!</i>

09:19.530 --> 09:21.707
I know what Pierce
is referring to.

09:21.741 --> 09:24.909
I have a box of forgotten items
in my apartment.

09:24.927 --> 09:27.796
I happen to be a single male.
Visitors leave things.

09:27.847 --> 09:30.465
Is one of your trophies
a pair of Miss Perry's panties?

09:30.516 --> 09:33.719
You told me a hawk stole them!

09:33.753 --> 09:38.356
You exploited me and made me believe
in a slightly more magical world.

09:38.391 --> 09:40.409
If you want to collect women's
underwear, can't you just buy them?

09:40.435 --> 09:42.444
- They have to be won in battle.
- Blegh! Gross!

09:42.478 --> 09:43.945
- Jeffrey!
- Awesome.

09:43.980 --> 09:46.948
I think we can all agree
that the gross thing here

09:46.983 --> 09:48.600
is that Pierce is snooping
through my stuff.

09:48.618 --> 09:50.719
Not really, Abed and I go
through your stuff all the time.

09:50.753 --> 09:52.354
Why do you keep bread
in the freezer?

09:52.388 --> 09:54.823
And why does your bathroom mirror say,
"You're special," when you fog it up?

09:54.874 --> 09:56.074
Look, I don't have
to answer these...

09:56.108 --> 09:57.793
- You took a shower?
- Yeah.

09:57.827 --> 10:00.629
- Mr. Barnes.
- Okay! I did it! Okay? I killed Pierce!

10:00.663 --> 10:03.582
- Lie.
- Okay, good. Just making sure.

10:03.616 --> 10:05.417
You and Abed Nadir
have a specialized,

10:05.451 --> 10:08.003
exclusive handshake that you refuse
to do with your other friends?

10:08.037 --> 10:10.055
- Absolutely.
- Pew-pew.

10:10.089 --> 10:11.877
Mr. Barnes, did you invent
that handshake?

10:11.878 --> 10:14.125
- Yes.
- Lie.

10:14.143 --> 10:18.013
Mr. Barnes, are you a subscriber
to the video blog "Fun for Friends"?

10:18.064 --> 10:19.331
- No.
- Lie.

10:19.365 --> 10:21.105
Silence, wench!

10:21.535 --> 10:24.915
<i>Hi, I'm Kevin, this is Kyle,
and here's a fun handshake</i>

10:24.937 --> 10:27.307
<i>you can do
with your best friend.</i>

10:28.241 --> 10:29.974
<i>All right!
Thanks for watching, guys.</i>

10:29.992 --> 10:32.828
<i>Don't forget to rate us,
comment, and subscribe.</i>

10:32.862 --> 10:35.497
- Can't look at you right now.
- Then you should know I'm crying.

10:35.581 --> 10:37.415
I forgive you, but only to
escape the established pattern

10:37.450 --> 10:40.268
of self-righteous indignation
followed by immediate comeuppance.

10:40.303 --> 10:42.687
- Mr. Nadir.
- Okay, I guess it's happening anyway.

10:42.722 --> 10:43.988
You broke my heart.
Continue.

10:44.006 --> 10:45.924
Is it true that you planted
geo-trafficking devices

10:45.958 --> 10:48.462
on everyone in the group so that you
would know where they are at all times?

10:48.487 --> 10:49.627
Yes.

10:51.394 --> 10:54.308
Okay, you guys are changing your faces.
Are you mad at me or hungry?

10:54.333 --> 10:57.552
You're tracking us?
We're mad at you, Abed.

10:57.603 --> 10:59.671
- Why?
- Because we already live

10:59.689 --> 11:01.807
in a totalitarian
surveillance state.

11:01.841 --> 11:04.059
Do you not read
my status updates?

11:04.110 --> 11:05.343
But I'm not the Government.
I'm your friend.

11:05.361 --> 11:07.195
That's what governments say,
nimrod.

11:07.230 --> 11:09.231
It's cool.
When one of you gets kidnapped,

11:09.282 --> 11:10.949
you'll be glad
you don't have to count

11:10.983 --> 11:12.417
the bumps on the highway
from the trunk of the car.

11:12.451 --> 11:14.903
- Are those blinking dots us?
- Mm-hmm.

11:14.954 --> 11:16.555
Well, what's this one
all the way to the side?

11:16.589 --> 11:18.751
That's where Pierce is buried.

11:19.709 --> 11:23.044
Is that why you were spending
so much time by the coffin?

11:23.079 --> 11:25.580
I was trying to get it back. They're
expensive. And he's not moving anymore.

11:25.631 --> 11:27.799
Abed, where did you plant
these things?

11:27.834 --> 11:29.501
If you makes you feel any
better, you'll never find them.

11:29.535 --> 11:32.838
I know you know it's wrong
to do that without telling us.

11:32.872 --> 11:35.173
- Shame on you!
- Okay, I'm ashamed.

11:35.207 --> 11:36.391
Lie.

11:36.425 --> 11:38.643
Miss Edison, is it true
you once secretly dosed

11:38.678 --> 11:41.924
the members of your study group
with a pharmaceutical amphetamine?

11:45.852 --> 11:48.520
- Oh, uh, yes, kind of.
- What?

11:48.554 --> 11:51.106
It sounds worse on paper
than it was.

11:51.157 --> 11:54.559
We were cramming for the anthro final.
Everyone was falling asleep.

11:54.577 --> 11:58.280
I put 5 milligrams of something-something
in your coffees and we all got an "A."

11:58.281 --> 11:59.437
Done!

11:59.438 --> 12:00.699
I'm a bad person
for tracking your location,

12:00.733 --> 12:02.417
but you altered
my brain chemistry?

12:02.451 --> 12:05.337
I was up for three days that week.
I invented an entire language,

12:05.371 --> 12:06.621
you fliztbarping gitzgorg.

12:06.672 --> 12:08.239
- I'm sorry.
- You messed with my brain.

12:08.257 --> 12:09.866
That's a big deal.
This is a big deal.

12:09.876 --> 12:11.042
I don't mess
with your brain, Annie.

12:11.076 --> 12:12.911
- You kind of do.
- I don't think I do.

12:12.929 --> 12:13.962
What about
her Facebook boyfriend?

12:14.013 --> 12:15.430
- What?
- That's different.

12:15.464 --> 12:18.717
You made a profile for a fake dude and
lured her into an online relationship.

12:18.751 --> 12:20.084
He's catfishing you.

12:20.102 --> 12:24.255
You're Olympic pole-vaulting
hopeful Brent Underjaw?

12:24.273 --> 12:25.774
I noticed whenever you were
in a relationship,

12:25.808 --> 12:27.442
you hummed a lot and made
pancakes in the morning.

12:27.476 --> 12:29.978
It wasn't about hurting you. I did
what I did in the name of breakfast.

12:30.012 --> 12:32.781
I bore my soul to you!

12:32.815 --> 12:35.917
I told you about my holding
hands at Disneyland fantasy.

12:35.952 --> 12:39.321
Do you care about people
at all, Abed?

12:39.372 --> 12:41.602
Answer on the polygraph!

12:42.074 --> 12:45.210
Jeff made me apply for handicapped
parking so he can get a better spot.

12:45.244 --> 12:47.984
Britta's the one that invited
Garrett to Annie's birthday party!

12:47.997 --> 12:50.131
Troy won't sit
on a toilet seat after Jeff!

12:50.166 --> 12:52.801
When we're alone, Shirley refers
to you guys as "those people."

12:52.835 --> 12:55.837
Oh! When Annie's with other females,
dude, she calls Jeff her uncle!

12:55.888 --> 12:57.541
Shirley thinks
we're all going to hell!

12:57.556 --> 12:59.474
- You are all going to hell!
- Oh, what?

13:03.095 --> 13:04.262
Guys, stop!

13:04.296 --> 13:07.132
We have to stop letting Pierce
do this to us!

13:07.166 --> 13:11.268
Mr. Hawthorne hasn't asked a question
in quite some time, Mr. Winger.

13:12.104 --> 13:13.822
He's right.

13:13.856 --> 13:16.608
I actually forgot for a second
that Pierce was dead.

13:16.642 --> 13:18.610
Maybe that's what he wanted.

13:18.644 --> 13:21.179
Or maybe he wanted us to know
we're no better off without him.

13:21.213 --> 13:23.031
Or no better than him.

13:25.001 --> 13:27.369
He kind of nailed it,
didn't he?

13:27.420 --> 13:30.154
I didn't just masturbate
in the study room.

13:30.172 --> 13:33.458
I masturbated everywhere.

13:33.492 --> 13:36.461
Everywhere!

13:40.599 --> 13:45.358
Confession is good for the soul.
You should try it sometime.

13:49.263 --> 13:52.135
There's another round of questions,
if you'd like to continue.

13:52.144 --> 13:54.694
You want to give us a moment
to sit in our own filth

13:54.695 --> 13:56.363
before you heap
another bucket on us?

13:56.381 --> 14:00.126
It's strange after all these years how
much we've kept hidden from each other.

14:00.135 --> 14:02.996
You'd think by now we would have
learned to be better people.

14:02.997 --> 14:06.713
I think we got into this mess by thinking
there was such a thing as better people.

14:07.839 --> 14:10.471
Wait.
That's it.

14:10.505 --> 14:12.640
If we're no better than Pierce,

14:12.691 --> 14:15.034
and Pierce is no worse than us,
then that means...

14:15.143 --> 14:16.894
Nobody's really that bad.

14:16.929 --> 14:18.746
So what if we're willing
to suffer

14:18.780 --> 14:22.811
and inflict pain at the mere
prospect of material reward?

14:22.812 --> 14:24.952
If we stop now,
that doesn't make us better.

14:24.987 --> 14:28.406
It just makes us so dishonest
that we would rather be poor

14:28.407 --> 14:29.897
than admit we're flawed.

14:29.898 --> 14:33.901
Pierce admitted he was flawed,
and he died rich.

14:34.006 --> 14:37.892
Let's celebrate his life
and death in the honest way,

14:37.927 --> 14:40.161
not by saying fake nice things
around a casket,

14:40.179 --> 14:42.463
but by admitting we're monsters

14:42.497 --> 14:45.666
and clawing joyfully
for some of his cash.

14:45.684 --> 14:50.016
So does anybody have anything
left before we continue?

14:50.389 --> 14:54.025
Let's empty our tanks of lies
once and for all.

14:54.059 --> 14:56.544
I'm Jeff Winger,
and if I had my choice,

14:56.579 --> 15:00.198
I would rather look at myself naked
than the women I sleep with.

15:00.232 --> 15:03.451
I'm the one who hit
Jeff's Lexus in the parking lot.

15:03.485 --> 15:05.320
It wasn't a taco truck,
and it was racist of me

15:05.354 --> 15:07.855
to improvise such an ethnically
specific vehicle.

15:07.873 --> 15:10.743
I only give money to homeless people
when I'm walking with someone.

15:10.759 --> 15:12.710
I've never been to Legoland.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.879
I just wanted you guys
to think I was cool.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.599
I can be passive-aggressive
sometimes.

15:17.633 --> 15:21.035
Don't everybody disagree at once.
Oh, Lord, I did it again.

15:21.053 --> 15:22.871
When any of you chew gum,
I want to punch you.

15:22.905 --> 15:25.890
You may as well have submachine guns
in your mouths. It vibrates my skull.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.709
Everybody clear?
All right.

15:28.727 --> 15:31.930
Mr. Stone, hit us
with your grand finale.

15:31.981 --> 15:34.532
May it be as brutal
as we deserve.

15:34.567 --> 15:35.783
Very well.

15:35.818 --> 15:38.086
Mr. Hawthorne's final round
of questions.

15:38.120 --> 15:40.140
Britta Perry...

15:40.651 --> 15:43.107
Do you know that you hate
yourself more than you should

15:43.158 --> 15:46.344
and that your passion
inspired me?

15:46.378 --> 15:47.561
No.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.364
That's true.
She didn't know.

15:49.398 --> 15:52.051
To Miss Perry,
I leave my iPod Nano

15:52.052 --> 15:55.086
filled with music to take life
less seriously by.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.422
Oh, that's nice.

15:57.456 --> 16:01.125
I also leave you this liquid nitrogen
cooled cylinder of my hyper-virile sperm

16:01.176 --> 16:03.378
in case your lesbian lifestyle
one day wears out

16:03.412 --> 16:06.346
and you wish to raise
an army of geniuses.

16:06.581 --> 16:08.099
- Shirley...
- Hmm?

16:08.133 --> 16:09.750
Did you know that you
are not only a credit

16:09.768 --> 16:11.919
to your race and gender,
but to our species,

16:11.937 --> 16:15.154
and that I was intimidated by your
strength of character and business acumen?

16:15.155 --> 16:16.274
Yes.

16:16.308 --> 16:17.642
To Shirley Bennett,

16:17.693 --> 16:19.611
I leave my spacious timeshare
in Florida...

16:20.410 --> 16:23.541
Where she can take What's-his-name and
however many children she has now.

16:24.153 --> 16:26.146
I also leave you a cylinder
of my sperm.

16:27.425 --> 16:29.106
Annie Edison...

16:29.622 --> 16:31.579
Did you know that you were
always my favorite?

16:31.606 --> 16:33.124
You mentioned it once, but...

16:33.158 --> 16:36.307
I leave you this tiara, which
you once refused to accept.

16:36.308 --> 16:37.795
It's the same tiara
I used to wear

16:37.830 --> 16:40.999
when my mother would verbally assault
me for not being a little girl.

16:41.050 --> 16:42.333
Also sperm.

16:42.813 --> 16:45.453
Jeff Winger,
did you know you're gay?

16:45.471 --> 16:48.072
- No.
- Agree to disagree.

16:48.107 --> 16:50.425
To you, I leave this bottle
of fine scotch

16:50.459 --> 16:54.434
so that you're less tempted to drink
this cylinder of even finer sperm.

16:54.733 --> 16:57.098
Abed Nadir, did you know
that you are insane

16:57.099 --> 16:59.500
and nothing that you said
ever made any sense to me?

16:59.535 --> 17:01.486
- Yep.
- Here's your sperm.

17:01.520 --> 17:06.406
Troy Barnes, did you know that you possess
the greatest gift life can give...

17:06.442 --> 17:08.493
The heart of a hero...

17:08.532 --> 17:11.853
And that it's up to you
not to waste it like I did?

17:13.281 --> 17:14.482
I think.

17:14.516 --> 17:17.545
To Troy,
I leave the obligatory sperm.

17:18.587 --> 17:21.039
Maybe it's because
everyone else got one,

17:21.089 --> 17:23.758
and because
it's an old man's semen,

17:23.791 --> 17:27.109
but, um,
I'm kind of disappointed.

17:27.451 --> 17:29.831
In addition, I am prepared
to leave Troy Barnes

17:29.865 --> 17:32.517
my remaining shares
in the Hawthorne Wipes company,

17:32.551 --> 17:35.503
currently valued
at $14.3 million.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.857
On one condition.

17:39.892 --> 17:43.177
You must first sail my boat,
the <i>Childish Tycoon,</i>

17:43.195 --> 17:45.813
by yourself
around the entire world.

17:45.848 --> 17:48.032
- What?
- Again with the bait and switch.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.401
When I was 23,
my father asked me

17:50.436 --> 17:53.237
to do the same thing to earn
my adulthood and his fortune.

17:53.288 --> 17:55.490
Of course I cheated and floated
off the coast of Belize

17:55.524 --> 17:57.691
for a year doing coke
with John Denver.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.060
I always regretted it.

17:59.094 --> 18:02.046
I'd like to give you a chance
to do what I never did -

18:02.081 --> 18:04.666
Become your own man.

18:05.134 --> 18:06.751
Okay, I'm a lawyer, Troy.

18:06.802 --> 18:10.671
It should be possible to contest
these conditions as unreasonable...

18:10.705 --> 18:12.273
- I'll do it.
- And Pierce can take

18:12.307 --> 18:13.541
his mind games
and his sperm and he can put...

18:13.559 --> 18:15.903
- I'll do it.
- What?

18:17.146 --> 18:18.563
Troy?

18:18.597 --> 18:20.732
Pierce was a crazy old coot,
yeah,

18:20.766 --> 18:25.845
but I think he knew something about
me that even I didn't know until now.

18:26.238 --> 18:31.311
Because he's offering me something
I've been searching for my whole life.

18:32.828 --> 18:35.300
Millions of dollars.

18:35.776 --> 18:39.033
And being a man
or whatever he said.

18:39.034 --> 18:41.894
Jeff, say something.

18:43.572 --> 18:45.359
I'm speechless.

18:47.075 --> 18:49.177
Somebody say something!

18:49.211 --> 18:50.757
Abed?

18:54.133 --> 18:57.552
Cool.
Cool, cool, cool.

18:57.586 --> 18:59.663
That's a lie.

19:07.991 --> 19:12.390
And then that sperm came down,
I mean, I couldn't say anything!

19:12.391 --> 19:15.474
But oh, my God!
I was gonna explode!

19:15.475 --> 19:18.227
And then that one,
that last question,

19:18.261 --> 19:21.013
with all of that nice stuff
out on the table,

19:21.064 --> 19:24.064
and you guys were having this discussion
about whether or not to quit?

19:24.067 --> 19:26.635
At first, I was like,
"Aaaaah!"

19:26.653 --> 19:29.291
But you did it!
You did it!

19:29.292 --> 19:31.106
It was amazing!

19:31.107 --> 19:33.492
You're amazing, man!
You're amazing!

19:33.526 --> 19:35.911
Guys, this is the best.

19:35.945 --> 19:38.130
We should do this every week.

19:38.164 --> 19:42.451
Oh, I'm a fun guy, you know?
I mean, you talk about lying.

19:42.485 --> 19:45.987
I was lying the whole time.
This is who I really am. This is me.

19:46.005 --> 19:48.323
This is the real me.
I'm artistic.

19:48.341 --> 19:52.044
Ideas come to me all the time.

19:52.095 --> 19:54.096
I have this idea for a movie.

19:54.130 --> 19:56.932
It's about this guy
who oversees polygraph tests,

19:56.966 --> 19:59.835
and the biggest obstacle
is how good-looking he is.

19:59.853 --> 20:02.221
People can't focus
and tell the truth.

20:02.272 --> 20:03.914
It's unbelievable.

20:03.915 --> 20:07.776
By the way, uh, we never
found out how Pierce died.

20:07.811 --> 20:10.896
Oh, my God. I can't believe
I didn't tell you yet.

20:10.947 --> 20:15.484
It was dehydration from filling
up all of those cylinders.

20:15.518 --> 20:18.854
I mean, it's how I want to go,
but, hey, I'm a little nutty.

20:20.573 --> 20:23.242
Are you guys thinking
what I'm thinking?

20:23.293 --> 20:25.022
Shots!

20:25.121 --> 20:28.121
