A 5, 6, 7, 8!

00:32.800 --> 00:35.570
Synchronize!

00:36.570 --> 00:38.440
Be serious.

00:43.750 --> 00:45.750
Pay attention now, Steven.

00:55.960 --> 00:59.360
- See?
- Mm.

01:29.520 --> 01:32.230
<i>I don't get it.
I thought I almost had it.</i>

01:32.270 --> 01:34.430
Nobody expects you
to be able to perform

01:34.500 --> 01:36.600
- fusion right away, Steven.
- Yeah!

01:36.670 --> 01:39.540
- It's really hard, even for us.
- Not for me.

01:39.610 --> 01:42.070
We'll keep working
on the dance for now,

01:42.140 --> 01:44.310
and who knows?
In a few years...

01:44.380 --> 01:48.480
I wonder, though, if Steven's
body is capable of fusion.

01:48.750 --> 01:51.750
Fusion merges the
physical forms of gems.

01:51.820 --> 01:55.090
But Steven is half human.
He's organic.

01:55.190 --> 01:57.790
- Organic?
- Aww, come on.

01:57.860 --> 02:00.360
It's Steven!
Who knows what's gonna happen?

02:02.980 --> 02:05.540
Well, I think Steven can do it.

02:07.860 --> 02:12.170
- Can you get them to write out the steps?
- No, I-I don't think

02:12.240 --> 02:15.470
it's just about the dancing.
When they fuse, they glow and

02:15.540 --> 02:19.140
kind of phase into each other.
I don't know if I can

02:19.210 --> 02:21.280
- even do that.
- Well, I think it's amazing

02:21.350 --> 02:23.450
you were able to dance with them at all.

02:23.520 --> 02:25.680
- I could never do that.
- Huh?

02:25.750 --> 02:28.390
- What do you mean?
- I've... never danced in front

02:28.450 --> 02:30.590
- of anyone before.
- Really?

02:30.660 --> 02:33.320
Yeah.
There was a dance at my school,

02:33.390 --> 02:35.290
and I was really excited about it.

02:35.360 --> 02:38.230
But... I just couldn't bring
myself to go.

02:38.300 --> 02:41.700
I just couldn't stop thinking
about everyone staring at me.

02:41.770 --> 02:46.440
<i>Well...
no one's staring right now.</i>

02:46.510 --> 02:50.410
- Um... you are.
- Oh. Yeah.

02:50.480 --> 02:53.380
Uh, one sec.

02:54.780 --> 02:58.860
So, what I was trying to say was...

02:59.110 --> 03:02.060
Come dance with me!

03:06.150 --> 03:07.930
Whoa!

03:15.030 --> 03:17.640
Whoa!

03:25.510 --> 03:27.340
Yeah!

03:29.570 --> 03:31.370
Whoa!

03:39.860 --> 03:43.260
<i>Whoa. Why am I?</i>

03:43.330 --> 03:45.830
<i>Why is...
your sandal... </i>

03:45.900 --> 03:49.500
<i>too small for my ... your feet?</i>

03:53.410 --> 03:55.540
Steven.
Connie!

03:55.610 --> 03:57.910
I ... I did it!
You did it?

03:57.980 --> 03:59.840
Wait.

03:59.910 --> 04:03.720
This ... no. This is...
Great!

04:03.780 --> 04:08.810
Ha! Oh, my gosh.
Look at you now!

04:08.870 --> 04:11.720
I'm a fusion.

04:17.519 --> 04:18.829
I have to show everybody.

04:21.072 --> 04:22.870
Pretty cool, right?

04:22.940 --> 04:26.540
He fused?
With his friend Connie?

04:28.038 --> 04:29.740
Pearl, look at Garnet.

04:32.410 --> 04:38.090
This is unprecedented.
A gem fusing with a human being?

04:38.130 --> 04:40.750
I-it's impossible!
Or, at the very least,

04:40.820 --> 04:43.820
- inappropriate.
- W-o-o-o-o-ow!

04:43.890 --> 04:49.260
You two look great together!
How does it feel, Steven?

04:49.330 --> 04:51.730
Connie?
Stevonnie?!

04:51.830 --> 04:54.830
- It feels amazing!
- Yes, well, I'm glad

04:54.930 --> 04:57.870
you're enjoying yourselves,
but you two should

04:57.940 --> 04:59.700
- unfuse this instant.
- Wait. What?!

04:59.770 --> 05:02.120
Pearl, you were so worried
Steven wouldn't

05:02.190 --> 05:04.440
be able to do this.
Aren't you proud of him?

05:04.510 --> 05:07.210
Of... course I am.
I ...

05:07.310 --> 05:11.280
- Garnet, help me out here.
- Stevonnie...

05:11.350 --> 05:15.350
Listen to me.
You are not two people,

05:15.350 --> 05:18.010
and you are not one person.

05:18.010 --> 05:20.660
You... are an experience!

05:20.730 --> 05:23.860
Make sure you're a good experience.

05:23.930 --> 05:28.470
Now go... Have... Fun!

05:50.820 --> 05:53.310
Waaaaah-hoo!

06:08.870 --> 06:10.240
- No...
- Sure...

06:10.310 --> 06:12.380
- Lars, seriously, he's really nice.
- I don't...

06:14.340 --> 06:18.450
H-H-How...
Can I help... me?

06:19.890 --> 06:22.920
Two doughnuts, please.

06:25.960 --> 06:28.930
- What do I owe you?
- Uh...

06:28.990 --> 06:31.430
Oh, nothing!
I-It's on the house.

06:31.530 --> 06:33.500
<i>- Really?
- Mm-hmm!</i>

06:33.570 --> 06:38.110
Okay!
But just so you know,

06:38.170 --> 06:43.570
that isn't a very sound
business practice.

06:45.640 --> 06:47.780
Sweet!
Two doughnuts!

06:47.850 --> 06:52.480
One for me and one...
for... Uh, me.

06:55.820 --> 06:58.540
Are you okay?

06:59.732 --> 07:01.260
We can stop if you...

07:01.330 --> 07:04.760
No! No, don't worry.

07:04.830 --> 07:06.730
Mmm.

07:09.540 --> 07:14.010
Oh, hey, sour... faced stranger.
Wow! Cool pants.

07:14.070 --> 07:17.540
Coo'. Rave tonight.

07:17.640 --> 07:21.380
- Like... a dance?
- Yeah, at the warehouse.

07:21.480 --> 07:24.420
I'm deejaying, and a bunch of my
friends from the internet

07:24.480 --> 07:27.690
are gonna be there.
There's gonna be free...

07:27.750 --> 07:30.410
- Uh, glow sticks.
- Yes!

07:30.440 --> 07:33.360
I'll definitely be there!
Yes, thanks!

07:33.730 --> 07:35.270
Coo'.

07:44.700 --> 07:46.600
Yeesh.

08:11.500 --> 08:16.570
I'm amazing.

08:31.550 --> 08:33.640
I... thought this wast a dance party.

08:33.710 --> 08:38.200
Why isn't anyone else dancing?

08:38.260 --> 08:41.169
This is what being cool
at a cool dance is, right?

08:41.230 --> 08:44.070
This is how it's...
supposed to be.

08:44.140 --> 08:46.020
Why... isn't it like it's
supposed to be?

08:50.710 --> 08:52.610
Uh...

09:00.690 --> 09:04.090
- Hey, baby.
- Huh?

09:04.160 --> 09:09.450
Get ready.
It's Kevin time.

09:18.240 --> 09:20.140
Uh...

09:29.180 --> 09:30.970
I don't understand what's wrong.

09:30.970 --> 09:34.100
You have fun dancing,
but this dance isn't fun!

09:34.140 --> 09:35.850
You're supposed to like this.

09:35.920 --> 09:40.020
Why don't we like this?

09:40.090 --> 09:41.640
I wish you were here.

09:41.640 --> 09:44.950
If we were together,
it would be okay.

09:44.950 --> 09:47.820
But we are together,
and it's not.

09:47.820 --> 09:50.740
- I'm alone.
- Not tonight.

09:50.770 --> 09:52.770
Hey, baby, why'd you leave me

09:52.840 --> 09:56.110
- on the dance floor?
- I don't ...

09:56.170 --> 09:57.940
I don't want to dance anymore.

09:57.940 --> 09:59.710
What are you talking about?

09:59.780 --> 10:02.110
We're the best thing that's ever
happened to this place.

10:02.180 --> 10:04.850
- Come back out with me.
- Why should I?

10:04.920 --> 10:08.620
Because we're angels walking
among garbage people.

10:08.690 --> 10:10.100
We're perfect for each other.

10:11.160 --> 10:13.220
How can you say that?
You don't even know us!

10:13.290 --> 10:15.890
Whoa, whoa.
I'm just looking for a dance.

10:15.960 --> 10:18.260
- Don't get crazy.
- No one is crazy!

10:18.330 --> 10:19.960
I just don't like feeling alone here!

10:20.030 --> 10:22.870
If you're so lonely, then dance with me.

10:22.930 --> 10:24.700
Ugh! Fine.

10:24.770 --> 10:27.970
You wanna dance?
Let's go.

10:30.200 --> 10:33.780
And it's Stevonnie.
I am not your baby.

10:40.290 --> 10:44.960
Okay, bring it back, girl.

10:48.360 --> 10:51.130
It's two kids!
I'm out!

10:51.200 --> 10:53.600
We're back.

11:00.810 --> 11:03.970
Ye-e-e-a-a-ah!
