Wait, wait, are you saying
you can steam clean,

10:16.508 --> 10:17.674
if you will,

10:17.767 --> 10:20.693
my husband's reputational
carpet, if you will?

10:20.862 --> 10:24.105
I am, and I will. And I will.

10:24.199 --> 10:26.273
The Institute is his only hope.

10:26.293 --> 10:30.128
Well, my reputation
is everything to me.

10:30.279 --> 10:33.022
That doesn't jibe
with your past behavior.

10:33.116 --> 10:36.042
I'm tired of reputations
being about past behavior.

10:36.194 --> 10:39.304
I'll do it.
Keep it safe.

10:46.721 --> 10:49.555
Here at the Institute,
we break our rehabilitants up

10:49.708 --> 10:52.150
according to the severity
of their mistakes.

10:52.377 --> 10:54.802
HOMER:
Uh-huh. Yep.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.546
That makes sense.

10:56.548 --> 10:57.714
Interesting.

10:57.732 --> 10:58.806

10:59.734 --> 11:01.993
We don't take any Halloween
mishaps more recent than that

11:02.220 --> 11:05.054

you should know better.

11:05.073 --> 11:06.239
Totally.

11:06.391 --> 11:07.740
Homer, meet your team.

11:07.893 --> 11:11.152

12:31.752 --> 12:34.902
Or what? You'll push us

12:34.921 --> 12:38.572

accident born out of rage.

12:38.666 --> 12:41.501

we believe

13:00.763 --> 13:02.280
good works overcome bad days.

13:02.507 --> 13:04.173
So, to fix your reputations,

13:04.175 --> 13:06.767
your team will be doing
public acts of charity.

13:06.861 --> 13:08.194
When we post them online,

13:08.271 --> 13:10.622

13:15.186 --> 13:16.352
Okay, then we'll spend the day

13:16.445 --> 13:18.538

the Internet told us to hate.

13:54.726 --> 13:57.076
They still hate us.
The plan isn't working.

13:57.228 --> 13:59.395
What do we do now?
Call 911?

13:59.488 --> 14:01.322
Unfortunately,
that was the only way

14:01.341 --> 14:03.232
to get you your lives back.

14:03.251 --> 14:06.419
Well, there is one other way.
No, we can't.

14:06.495 --> 14:09.238
-What?
-No, it's too radical.

14:09.257 --> 14:13.076
Ah, but it's the only thing
that's 100% guaranteed to work.

14:13.094 --> 14:15.261
Hmm, yeah, it does sound
pretty radical.

14:15.338 --> 14:17.080
Thanks for being honest
about that.

14:17.098 --> 14:18.931
Well, sometimes
the only way to get results

14:19.025 --> 14:20.583
is through radical action.

14:20.602 --> 14:22.602
Sorry, we took a vote.
It's too radical.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.511
Wh... I didn't even
tell you what it is yet.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.030
When you said "radical,"
you said enough.

14:26.182 --> 14:27.273
Bye forever.

14:27.425 --> 14:29.592
Look, I thought that
by calling it radical,

14:29.611 --> 14:31.185
you'd be more likely
to want to do it.

14:31.279 --> 14:33.096
Like you'd be intrigued
or something.

14:33.189 --> 14:35.781
(gasps) Intrigued, eh?

14:35.934 --> 14:38.001
You are all here
at The Institute...

14:39.287 --> 14:41.028
...because of
the humiliation you faced

14:41.122 --> 14:43.364
after the world
saw you on your worst day.

14:43.383 --> 14:44.531
(all shudder)

14:44.609 --> 14:46.459
But, what if you could
delete all that

14:46.611 --> 14:50.037
from every computer,
every phone, every meme,

14:50.056 --> 14:53.057
and even every personal
hard drive on Earth?

14:53.284 --> 14:54.450
But that's impossible.

14:54.452 --> 14:57.395
You'd have to invent
something to do that.

14:57.546 --> 14:58.712
Funny you say that.
I did

14:58.732 --> 15:00.640
invent something to do that.

15:00.792 --> 15:03.234
A universal eradication code
that can completely scrub

15:03.461 --> 15:06.312
any image or video
from the entire Internet.

15:06.464 --> 15:08.239
Scrub us.
You scrub us right now!

15:08.466 --> 15:10.983
Oh, I would, but first
I need to upload the code

15:11.136 --> 15:12.635
into the one server
powerful enough

15:12.654 --> 15:15.413
to reach every corner
of the World Wide Web.

15:16.658 --> 15:17.731
ChumNet.

15:18.734 --> 15:20.810
You mean the company
that puts those annoying

15:20.828 --> 15:24.163
clickbait-y headlines
on the bottom of every website?

15:24.315 --> 15:26.132
Yes, they're everywhere.

15:27.001 --> 15:29.318
No platform has greater reach.

15:29.337 --> 15:31.320
But to upload the scrub code
into their servers,

15:31.339 --> 15:35.158
I need you to break in
to the ChumNet headquarters.

15:35.176 --> 15:37.343
Break in?
That sounds dangerous.

15:37.420 --> 15:38.585
It is, Helen.

15:38.680 --> 15:40.271
That was the radical part
I mentioned earlier,

15:40.498 --> 15:42.423
that didn't seem
to land with any of you.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.425
Radical, eh?

15:44.444 --> 15:46.427
Yeah, we don't have
anything to lose.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.280
So, we're kind of like
a suicide squad.

15:49.507 --> 15:52.358
You're exactly kind of like
a suicide squad.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.600
What do you say?

15:53.620 --> 15:55.845
I think we can pull this-O.

15:55.863 --> 15:57.121
I say we do it.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.458
We need to fight for each other,
because we're a family.

16:00.609 --> 16:01.684
ALL: Aw.

16:01.777 --> 16:04.203
A family I don't want or need.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.872
I miss my actual family,
so let's do this.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.115
(all agree)

16:08.134 --> 16:10.376
But if we're going
on a commando mission,

16:10.453 --> 16:12.136
don't we need
some sort of training?

16:12.363 --> 16:13.620
(laughs) Don't you see?
