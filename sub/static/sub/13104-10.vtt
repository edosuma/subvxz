WEBVTT

00:01.530 --> 00:07.093
***

00:26.020 --> 00:31.083
THE SERVICE WAS BEAUTIFUL.

00:31.130 --> 00:33.052
AMAZING TURNOUT.

00:33.100 --> 00:34.249
CHIEF SPOKE
REALLY WELL.

00:34.300 --> 00:38.088
YEAH. YEAH,
AMAZINGLY WELL.

00:38.130 --> 00:40.667
I ALMOST DIDN'T KNOW
WHO HE WAS TALKING ABOUT.

00:40.700 --> 00:44.431
"WHAT A NOBLE DEATH,
WHAT AN OUTSTANDING CITIZEN."

00:44.470 --> 00:45.767
IT'S JUST THE THING IS,

00:45.810 --> 00:48.574
NO ONE WAS ACTUALLY
TALKING ABOUT JERRY.

00:50.350 --> 00:52.215
JERRY...

00:52.250 --> 00:55.674
WHO, UH, COULDN'T PRONOUNCE
"NANAIMO."

00:55.720 --> 00:59.315
WHO LIKED TO GO
FOR PEDICURES WITH HIS MOTHER.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.009
JERRY WHO PROPOSED TO ME

01:01.060 --> 01:04.450
BY ENGRAVING IT
ON THE BACK OF A KNIFE.

01:08.060 --> 01:10.426
THIS IS JERRY.

01:12.970 --> 01:14.961
(whispers) OH, MY GOD.

01:19.880 --> 01:24.704
I GO'I'I'A GO, GUYS. UM, FRANK'S IN
THE CAR WITH THE BABY.

01:24.750 --> 01:25.808
(siren wailing in distance)

01:25.850 --> 01:29.183
I'M GONNA GO NOW, TOO.
SEE YOU AT THE STATION.

01:41.930 --> 01:44.125
YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:44.170 --> 01:46.968
WE CAN STAY HERE THE WHOLE DAY
IF WE WANT.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.194
YEAH.

01:48.940 --> 01:51.704
YEAH.
'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?

01:51.740 --> 01:53.469
TODAY'S A GOOD DAY.

01:53.510 --> 01:55.307
IT IS.

01:55.340 --> 01:58.309
IT IS.
TOMORROW'S GONNA BE MUCH...

01:59.420 --> 02:00.842
MUCH DIFFERENT.

02:00.880 --> 02:02.745
YESTERDAY WE HAD THE WAKE.

02:02.790 --> 02:05.441
TODAY, THE FUNERAL.

02:05.490 --> 02:07.879
TOMORROW,
THERE'S NOTHING LEFI' TO DO.

02:07.920 --> 02:10.150
TOMORROW WE'RE GONNA WAKE UP,
AND THE--

02:10.190 --> 02:15.822
THE WORLD'S GOING TO EXPECT IT
TO BE... LIKE ANY OTHER DAY.

02:27.340 --> 02:30.605
(Nick) TRACI KEPT IT TOGETHER
SOMEHOW.

02:30.650 --> 02:32.641
SHE HELPED JERRY'S MOM
MAKE IT THROUGH THE SERVICE,

02:32.680 --> 02:34.511
HELD HER HAND.

02:35.380 --> 02:37.314
YOU KNOW,
I CAN TAKE YOU THERE,

02:37.350 --> 02:39.454
IF YOU WANT--CEMETERY.

02:41.360 --> 02:44.955
WELL, IF I COULD BE THERE,
I WOULD, BUT I...

02:44.990 --> 02:47.356
I CAN'T.
IT'S JUST DOCTOR'S ORDERS.

02:47.400 --> 02:50.597
I HAVE TO STAY
UNTIL THEY DO MORE TESTS.

02:50.630 --> 02:51.858
I THOUGHT THEY SAID
YOU WERE OKAY.

02:51.900 --> 02:54.266
THEY SAID I SEEMED OKAY,
YOU KNOW?

02:54.300 --> 02:56.666
BUT I WAS KIDNAPPED AND DRUGGED
AND TIED TO A BED,

02:56.710 --> 02:59.133
SO I THINK
IT'S PRE'ITY NORMAL

02:59.170 --> 03:00.876
TO SPEND A FEW DAYS
IN THE HOSPITAL.

03:02.080 --> 03:04.708
TAKE AS LONG AS YOU NEED.

03:07.580 --> 03:09.241
(Andy) HEY,
WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE?

03:09.290 --> 03:12.680
IT'S A BLACK LEATHER
COMPUTER BAG.

03:12.720 --> 03:14.688
JERRY STYLE.

03:14.720 --> 03:16.449
(siren wailing in distance)

03:16.490 --> 03:18.526
(Objects clattering)

03:18.560 --> 03:19.993
YEAH, I CAN'T FIND IT.

03:20.030 --> 03:22.328
YOU SURE YOU BROUGHT IT IN?

03:22.370 --> 03:25.066
WELL, MAYBE I LEFI' IT
IN MY CAR LAST NIGHT.

03:25.100 --> 03:26.328
OKAY, YOU WANT ME
TO GO GET IT?

03:26.370 --> 03:29.362
NO, I'LL GO LATER.
IF I HAVE HIS COMPUTER HERE,

03:29.410 --> 03:32.629
I'LL JUST STARE AT PICTURES
OF US ALL DAY.

03:32.680 --> 03:35.808
YOU SHOULD GO.
YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE FOR WORK.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.000
DO YOU WANT ME
TO CALL DEX,

03:37.050 --> 03:38.745
SEE IF LEO
CAN COME OVER?

03:38.780 --> 03:41.112
I DON'T WANT LEO
TO SEE ME LIKE THIS.

03:41.150 --> 03:44.642
OKAY.
WELL, YOU NEED TO EAT.

03:44.690 --> 03:46.214
THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD FOOD
IN THE FRIDGE.

03:46.260 --> 03:47.659
OKAY.

03:48.860 --> 03:50.953
HEY, LISTEN, YOU NEED ANYTHING,
YOU CALL ME, ALL RIGHT?

03:50.990 --> 03:52.548
I CAN BE BACK HERE
IN TEN MINUTES.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.192
THANKS, ANDY.

03:59.300 --> 04:00.437
(door creaks)

04:00.470 --> 04:02.301
HOW'S GAIL DOING?

04:02.340 --> 04:03.898
SHE SEEMED TO BE DOING
A LITTLE BETI'ER THIS MORNING

04:03.940 --> 04:05.202
WHEN I WENT OVER.

04:05.240 --> 04:06.275
I'M GONNA STOP BY
AFI'ER SHIFT,

04:06.310 --> 04:08.608
MAYBE BRING HER
SOMETHING TO EAT.

04:08.640 --> 04:10.676
WHAT DO YOU FEEL LIKE
HAVING FOR LUNCH TODAY?

04:10.710 --> 04:12.177
I BROUGHT A SANDWICH.

04:12.210 --> 04:14.212
MM.

04:14.250 --> 04:15.615
WELL, HOW ABOUT YOU, OLIVER?

04:15.650 --> 04:17.186
FEEL LIKE PIZZA TODAY?

04:17.220 --> 04:18.312
WHY IS THAT WHENEVER
ANYTHING TRAGIC HAPPENS,

04:18.350 --> 04:20.409
ALL PEOPLE WANNA DO
IS TALK ABOUT FOOD?

04:20.460 --> 04:21.779
WHAT'S FOOD GONNA DO?

04:21.820 --> 04:23.924
I DON'T KNOW.
WE STILL NEED TO EAT.

04:23.960 --> 04:29.660
I GO'I'I'A TAKE A RAIN CHECK,
'CAUSE I'M NOT BEING HERE TODAY.

04:29.700 --> 04:30.928
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

04:30.970 --> 04:32.699
TAKING A PERSONAL DAY.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.465
SAM?

04:36.510 --> 04:37.932
SAM.

04:37.970 --> 04:39.301
HEY.

04:39.340 --> 04:41.331
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO CALL YOU.
ARE YOU OKAY?

04:41.380 --> 04:42.847
YEAH.

04:43.750 --> 04:44.899
NO. NOT REALLY.

04:44.950 --> 04:46.838
DO YOU WANNA
TALK ABOUT IT?

04:46.880 --> 04:49.519
NO, I REALLY DON'T.

04:49.550 --> 04:52.519
(radio chatter)

04:52.560 --> 04:55.256
(indistinct conversations)

04:55.290 --> 04:56.780
(lowered voice) SARGE,
IF IT'S ALL RIGHT WITH YOU,

04:56.830 --> 04:58.525
I'D LIKE TO RIDE ALONE
TODAY.

04:58.560 --> 04:59.595
YEAH, YEAH, NO PROBLEM.

04:59.630 --> 05:00.597
ALL RIGHT. THANKS.

05:00.630 --> 05:01.949
YEAH.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.627
(telephones ringing)

05:03.670 --> 05:05.968
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE,

05:06.000 --> 05:07.797
I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY FOR US
TO BE HERE TODAY,

05:07.840 --> 05:11.332
BUT WE'RE HERE,
SO LET'S BE HERE.

05:11.370 --> 05:12.507
THERE'S A TRICKLE EFFECT

05:12.540 --> 05:15.179
WHEN AN OFFICER DIES SUDDENLY
LIKE THIS--

05:15.210 --> 05:17.508
UH, LOOSE ENDS LEFT UNTIED,
THINGS FORGOTTEN,

05:17.550 --> 05:18.801
NOT DEALT WITH.

05:18.850 --> 05:21.114
BUT WE GOTTA MAKE SURE
THAT JERRY'S HARD WORK

05:21.150 --> 05:22.174
IS NOT LEFT HANGING.

05:23.090 --> 05:24.910
I NEED SOMEBODY TO, UH,

05:24.950 --> 05:27.817
GO THROUGH
DETECTIVE BARBER'S DESK...

05:27.860 --> 05:28.815
CLEAN IT OUT.

05:28.860 --> 05:30.350
CATALOGUE EVERYTHING.

05:31.190 --> 05:32.794
IT'S A PROTOCOL
WE HAVE TO FOLLOW.

05:32.830 --> 05:34.718
DIAZ AND I WILL DO IT.

05:35.800 --> 05:36.664
THAN KS.

05:37.770 --> 05:39.988
SO LET'S ALL TRY AND GET
THROUGH THIS DAY, ALL RIGHT?

05:43.140 --> 05:46.906
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

05:46.940 --> 05:51.047
(inhaling and exhaling deeply)

05:51.080 --> 05:52.911
YOU TAKING UP YOGA?

05:54.380 --> 05:57.747
YEAH. MY, UH, DOCTOR SAID
I SHOULD TRY

05:57.790 --> 06:00.953
AND DO SOMETHING
TO HELP CALM MY NERVES.

06:00.990 --> 06:02.958
'CAUSE APPARENTLY GETTING
KIDNAPPED BY A SERIAL KILLER

06:02.990 --> 06:04.981
CAN MAKE YOU KINDA EDGY.

06:05.030 --> 06:07.123
YOU HAVEN'T RETURNED
MY CALLS.

06:08.760 --> 06:10.489
I CAN'T USE THAT PHONE.

06:10.530 --> 06:12.259
SICK PEOPLE--THEY--
THEY COUGH,

06:12.300 --> 06:13.733
AND THEY BREATHE
INTO THAT MOUTHPIECE, SO...

06:13.770 --> 06:17.160
WELL, SICK PEOPLE ALSO PUT
THEIR FEET ON THAT FLOOR.

06:17.210 --> 06:20.737
BUT THE REALLY SICK PEOPLE--
THEY--THEY CAN'T WALK, SO...

06:20.780 --> 06:22.702
GAIL, WE NEED TO GO THROUGH
YOUR STATEMENT AGAIN.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.069
I HAVE SOME MORE QUESTIONS.

06:24.110 --> 06:26.044
SO ARE YOU--
ARE YOU BACK?

06:26.080 --> 06:29.447
OR ARE YOU JUST HERE TO
DEAL WITH THIS WHOLE THING?

06:29.490 --> 06:30.343
I DON'T KNOW YET.

06:31.450 --> 06:34.214
WELL, IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU,
I WOULD REALLY RATHER

06:34.260 --> 06:36.251
WAIT TO DO THIS
UNTIL I'M OUTTA HERE.

06:36.290 --> 06:38.349
IT'S BETTER
IF WE DO THIS NOW.

06:40.560 --> 06:42.926
(woman) I NEED TO TALK
TO JERRY BARBER.

06:42.970 --> 06:44.995
MAN, COME ON. I NEED TO TALK
TO JERRY BARBER!

06:45.030 --> 06:46.566
I NEED SOME--OKAY.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.693
YEAH? OKAY.
(door buzzes)

06:48.740 --> 06:50.332
(door beeps)
HEY, SADIE, WHAT'S UP?

06:50.370 --> 06:52.838
I'M CLAIMING SANCTUARY, OKAY?
WHATEVER YOU CALL IT.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.006
OKAY, THAT'S FINE.
WE'RE NOT A CHURCH.

06:54.040 --> 06:55.507
OKAY, WELL, CAN YOU--

06:55.540 --> 06:57.098
CAN YOU HELP ME OUT
WITH SOME PROTECTION?

06:57.150 --> 06:58.447
YOU OWE ME THAT, RIGHT?
YOU OWE ME THAT.
OKAY, THAT'S FINE.

06:58.480 --> 07:00.914
OKAY. JUST STOP YELLING.
WHAT IS GOING ON?

07:02.150 --> 07:03.845
I KEEP ALL OPEN CASE FILES
TOGETHER.

07:03.890 --> 07:05.016
I WANT THEM READY
TO BE HANDED OFF

07:05.050 --> 07:06.688
TO THE DETECTIVE SERGEANT.

07:06.720 --> 07:08.608
KEEP PERSONAL STUFF TOGETHER.

07:08.660 --> 07:10.389
GOTTA GET IT OFF TO HIS FAMILY.
TRACI?

07:10.430 --> 07:11.954
THEY WEREN'T MARRIED YET.

07:11.990 --> 07:14.129
TECHNICALLY, HIS MOTHER
IS HIS NEXT OF KIN.

07:14.160 --> 07:16.151
CATALOGUE EVERYTHING.

07:16.200 --> 07:18.566
WE NEED A RECORD
OF WHATEVER YOU FIND.

07:18.600 --> 07:19.999
(keys jangle)

07:20.040 --> 07:23.100
(radio chatter,
telephone ringing)

07:23.140 --> 07:24.300
LAST TIME I SAW JERRY,
WE, UH,

07:24.340 --> 07:26.729
WE MET AT A COFFEE SHOP
ON CHURCH STREET.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.475
I WANTED HIM TO--
TO HELP ME GET THIS YOUNG GIRL

07:28.510 --> 07:29.772
OFF THE STREET.

07:29.810 --> 07:32.301
CALVIN, YOU KNOW, MY PIMP--
HE RECRUITED HER,

07:32.350 --> 07:33.715
BUT SHE'S WAY TOO YOUNG.

07:33.750 --> 07:35.012
YOU KNOW, I GOT MORALS.

07:35.050 --> 07:37.917
JERRY PROMISED THAT HE WAS
GONNA TAKE CARE OF IT,

07:37.950 --> 07:40.714
EXCEPT LAST NIGHT
SHE'S STILL WORKING THE STREETS,

07:40.760 --> 07:42.785
AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN
CALVIN KNOWS THAT--

07:42.830 --> 07:44.525
THAT I RATTED HIM OUT.

07:44.560 --> 07:46.619
JERRY PROMISED THAT HE WASN'T
GONNA SAY ANYTHING.

07:46.660 --> 07:49.254
I REALLY DON'T THINK JERRY WOULD
EVER TELL ANYBODY ABOUT THIS.

07:49.300 --> 07:51.621
WELL, THEN HOW DOES CALVIN KNOW
THE EXACT TIME AND PLACE

07:51.670 --> 07:53.763
THAT I WAS MEETING UP
WITH JERRY?

07:53.800 --> 07:55.199
I DON'T KNOW.

07:55.240 --> 07:56.605
THEN GET JERRY
ON THE PHONE.

07:56.640 --> 07:58.107
MAYBE HE'S GONNA ANSWER
YOUR CALLS,

07:58.140 --> 07:59.676
'CAUSE HE'S NOT
ANSWERING MINE.

07:59.710 --> 08:02.679
SADIE, LISTEN, I...
(exhales deeply)

08:03.750 --> 08:05.945
I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS.

08:07.050 --> 08:09.075
(Sam speaking indistinctly)

08:09.120 --> 08:10.542
TRACI.

08:10.590 --> 08:11.989
HEY.

08:12.020 --> 08:14.488
JERRY'S COMPUTER?
WHAT ABOUT IT?

08:14.520 --> 08:16.488
IT WAS STOLEN OUT OF MY CAR.

08:16.530 --> 08:18.327
IT HAD ALL OF OUR PICTURES
ON IT.

08:18.360 --> 08:20.191
IT HAD ALL OF JERRY'S MUSIC.

08:20.230 --> 08:21.549
WHAT ELSE
WAS ON THAT COMPUTER?

08:21.600 --> 08:22.897
ALL OF HIS PHOTOS,

08:22.930 --> 08:24.363
OUR PHOTOS,
US TOGETHER WITH LEO,

08:24.400 --> 08:25.924
EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING.

08:25.970 --> 08:27.460
WELL,
WHAT ABOUT WORK STUFF?

08:27.500 --> 08:29.707
IT'S JUST, I'M--I'M ASKING
BECAUSE WORD GOT OUT

08:29.740 --> 08:31.628
THAT JERRY WAS MEETING UP
WITH SADIE.

08:31.670 --> 08:33.399
HER PIMP KNEW THE EXACT
TIME AND DATE OF THE MEETING.

08:33.440 --> 08:35.738
DID JERRY KEEP THAT STUFF
ON HIS COMPUTER?

08:35.780 --> 08:37.077
HIS MEET-UP SCHEDULE
WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE,

08:37.110 --> 08:39.476
STUFF HE'S WORKING ON
THIS WEEK.

08:39.510 --> 08:41.546
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT. HE DIDN'T
KNOW THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

08:41.580 --> 08:43.138
NO, OF C--OF COURSE NOT.
OF COURSE NOT.

08:43.190 --> 08:46.182
LOOK, UH, THERE'S A PAWNSHOP
A FEW BLOCKS FROM MCNALLY'S.

08:46.220 --> 08:47.380
IF IT WAS A SMASH AND GRAB,

08:47.420 --> 08:49.581
THAT'S PROBABLY
THEIR FIRST STOP.

08:56.360 --> 08:57.566
(coughs)

08:57.600 --> 08:59.261
(stool scrapes floor)

09:03.410 --> 09:04.502
(Opens cabinet door)

09:04.540 --> 09:05.507
(glasses clink)

09:05.540 --> 09:06.632
(closes cabinet door)

09:06.680 --> 09:09.308
(bottle cap fizzes)

09:09.340 --> 09:11.774
(bottle cap clatters)
THERE YOU GO.

09:11.810 --> 09:15.211
THANKS. I WILL TAKE
ONE OF THOSE.

09:16.690 --> 09:17.748
(glass clinks)

09:17.790 --> 09:20.759
(glass clatters, alcohol pours)

09:28.130 --> 09:29.666
CHEERS, BUDDY.
(clink)

09:36.840 --> 09:39.035
PEOPLE BRING ME COMPUTERS
BY THE DOZEN.

09:39.070 --> 09:41.209
I FIX 'EM, REBUILD THEM,
RESELL 'EM. THAT'S IT.

09:41.240 --> 09:42.707
WHAT'D YOU GET
IN THE LAST 24 HOURS?

09:42.750 --> 09:44.900
(scoffs) I DON'T KNOW.
I GOT A FEW. HERE.

09:44.950 --> 09:46.975
NO, NOT THAT ONE.

09:47.020 --> 09:49.113
SHOW ME THAT ONE
ON THE BOTTOM.

09:49.150 --> 09:51.289
***

09:51.320 --> 09:53.788
(police radio chatter)

09:53.820 --> 09:54.980
THAT'S IT.
WHAT WAS ON THIS ONE?

09:55.020 --> 09:56.829
NOTHING. IT WAS WIPED CLEAN.
CHUCK...

09:56.860 --> 09:58.589
I CLEANED IT UP, RESTORED ALL
THE ORIGINAL SETTINGS...
IT'S NOT 1987.

09:58.630 --> 10:01.326
GAVE IT A BIT MORE RAM.
YOU'RE NOT MAKING MONEY
SELLING HARDWARE ANYMORE.

10:01.360 --> 10:02.759
PEOPLE BRING IN
THEIR COMPUTERS.

10:02.800 --> 10:04.529
THEY DON'T PROPERLY
WIPE THEIR HARD DRIVES.

10:04.570 --> 10:05.969
YOU GO THROUGH 'EM
WITH A FINE-TOOTHED COMB

10:06.000 --> 10:08.537
AND FIND CREDIT CARD NUMBERS,
MAYBE SOME SOCIALS,

10:08.570 --> 10:09.764
THEN YOU SELL THE INFO
FOR CASH.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.300
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

10:11.340 --> 10:13.604
OKAY, THE THING IS, TODAY,
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT.

10:13.640 --> 10:16.074
TODAY I CARE ABOUT WHAT WAS
ON THIS COMPUTER.

10:16.110 --> 10:18.806
THERE WAS NOTHING ON IT.
A FEW NAMES. THAT'S IT.

10:18.850 --> 10:20.818
I TOLD SADIE'S OLD MAN
SHE'S TALKING TO THE COPS.

10:20.850 --> 10:23.284
SO WHAT? HEY!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:23.320 --> 10:24.685
AND NOW SHE FEARS
FOR HER LIFE.

10:24.720 --> 10:26.381
SO GOD KNOWS WHO ELSE
YOU PUT IN DANGER.

10:26.420 --> 10:27.557
THERE WASN'T
ANYTHING ELSE ON IT.

10:27.590 --> 10:31.185
I SWEAR TO GOD.
LOOK, I BACKED IT UP.

10:31.230 --> 10:32.549
(sighs) JEEZ, MAN.

10:32.590 --> 10:34.490
***

10:34.530 --> 10:36.293
(police radio chatter)

10:36.330 --> 10:37.820
I WAS STAYING AT ANDY'S,

10:37.870 --> 10:39.269
AND THERE WAS A KNOCK
AT THE DOOR,

10:39.300 --> 10:44.533
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS NICK,
SO I ANSWERED IT.

10:44.570 --> 10:46.435
AND THEN THE NEXT THING
YOU KNOW,

10:46.470 --> 10:50.349
THE DOOR SLAMS ME IN THE HEAD.
THERE'S A GUY WEARING A MASK.

10:50.380 --> 10:54.214
WE'RE FIGHTING, AND THEN
HE GETS ON TOP OF ME,

10:55.320 --> 10:57.413
STARTS CHOKING ME,
AND THEN I PASSED OUT.

10:57.450 --> 10:59.884
YOU SAID IN YOUR STATEMENT
THAT YOUR MEMORY OF THE INCIDENT

10:59.920 --> 11:01.581
WAS A LITTLE FOGGY.

11:01.620 --> 11:02.985
ANYTHING COME BACK TO YOU?

11:03.030 --> 11:05.555
LIKE I'LL GET A FLASH
EVERY NOW AND THEN.

11:05.590 --> 11:06.625
OF?

11:07.700 --> 11:11.397
IT'S LIKE THE SOUND
OF HIS SHOES ON THE CEMENT.

11:11.430 --> 11:15.867
OR THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WANTED.

11:15.900 --> 11:19.666
CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT HIS PLAN
WAS TO RAPE AND KILL ME, AND...

11:19.710 --> 11:23.908
(siren wailing in distance)

11:23.950 --> 11:25.747
IF IT WASN'T FOR JERRY...

11:26.920 --> 11:29.889
(telephone rings)

11:29.920 --> 11:31.888
WHAT SHOULD WE DO?
SHOULD WE ANSWER IT?

11:31.920 --> 11:33.080
UH, NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

11:33.120 --> 11:34.189
I MEAN, IT'LL PROBABLY
GO TO VOICE MAIL

11:34.220 --> 11:36.825
OR BE REDIRECTED
OR SOMETHING.

11:36.860 --> 11:38.452
(ﬁng)

11:38.490 --> 11:39.684
(ringing stops)

11:42.870 --> 11:47.534
NAM E--PRITOM.
HOME COUNTRY--BANGLADESH.

11:47.570 --> 11:50.368
I THINK JERRY
WAS SPONSORING THIS KID.

11:50.410 --> 11:52.469
YEAH, WELL, NOT ANYMORE.

11:52.510 --> 11:54.205
YOU KNOW, IF YOU CAN'T
HANDLE THIS--

11:54.240 --> 11:56.299
JERRY WAS A COP
FOR THIS DIVISION FOR 14 YEARS,

11:56.340 --> 11:58.240
AND THIS IS WHAT HE HAS
TO SHOW FOR IT--

11:58.280 --> 12:00.544
A, UH, A NAMEPLATE.
(clatters)

12:00.580 --> 12:02.172
TELEPHONE,

12:02.220 --> 12:04.108
A COFFEE MUG
WITH A BROKEN HANDLE,

12:04.150 --> 12:05.686
ALL SHOVED IN A 10X12 BOX

12:05.720 --> 12:07.915
LIKE THAT'S SUPPOSED
TO MEAN SOMETHING.

12:07.960 --> 12:10.884
OKAY. BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
THE PHONE BELONGS TO 15.

12:10.930 --> 12:12.249
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

12:12.290 --> 12:14.429
NO, I DON'T. I MEAN, LOOK,
LOOK AT HIS WORK.

12:14.460 --> 12:16.098
THAT'S HIS LEGACY.
THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT.

12:16.130 --> 12:20.999
THAT'S WHAT MEANS SOMETHING.
THIS IS JUST, UH, A DESK.

12:21.040 --> 12:22.837
WITH A LOT OF CASH IN IT.

12:26.740 --> 12:28.230

12:45.390 --> 12:46.425
Frank Best.

12:46.460 --> 12:49.327
FRANK, UH,
I GOT JERRY'S COMPUTER.

12:49.360 --> 12:51.999
SADIE'S NAME AND NUMBER ARE
RIGHT HERE IN HIS CALENDAR.

12:52.030 --> 12:53.668
ALSO, LOOKS LIKE HE HAD
SOMETHING IN PLAY

12:53.700 --> 12:55.258
WITH A CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANT,

12:55.300 --> 12:57.768
NUMBER 6540-B.

12:57.810 --> 12:59.607
YEAH, WELL, THEY KEEP
ALL THE INFORMATION ON C.I.s

12:59.640 --> 13:00.800
DOWN AT
THE INTELLIGENCE BUREAU.

13:00.840 --> 13:03.638
LET ME PUT IN A CALL,
FIND OUT WHO THAT IS.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.674
EPSTEIN, I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING HERE.

13:14.120 --> 13:15.883
SWAREK, I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

13:21.030 --> 13:22.019
HE DEFINITELY HAD
SOMETHING IN PLAY,

13:22.060 --> 13:23.789
BUT I WASN'T IN ON IT.

13:23.830 --> 13:26.060
THE GUY WAS SKITTISH,
ONLY WANTED TO TALK TO JERRY.

13:26.100 --> 13:27.931
WAS HE CARDED?
YEP.

13:27.970 --> 13:29.631

13:29.670 --> 13:32.400
EPSTEIN AND DIAZ FOUND $30,000
IN JERRY'S DESK.

13:32.440 --> 13:34.101
JERRY WAS WORKING ON SOMETHING
WITH THIS GUY.

13:34.140 --> 13:35.334
DO WE KNOW
HOW TO FIND HIM?

13:35.380 --> 13:37.268
HERE'S HIS ADDRESS.

13:37.310 --> 13:39.972
CALL SWAREK. GET HIM TO MEET
YOU AND COLLINS THERE.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.419

THERE'S BEEN 'OIEA-IYANGE OF PLANS.

14:18.720 --> 14:21.086
JERRY WAS SUPPOSED TO SHOW UP
AT MY PLACE LAST NIGHT

14:21.120 --> 14:23.429
WITH 30 GRAND. I'M SUPPOSED
TO PAY OFF MY SUPPLIERS,

14:23.460 --> 14:25.382
DO ANOTHER BUY.
HE BAILS ON ME.

14:25.430 --> 14:27.091
I DON'T GO 'CAUSE I DON'T
HAVE THE MONEY.

14:27.130 --> 14:28.324

14:28.360 --> 14:30.123
MY SUPPLIERS COME
LOOKING FOR ME, MAN.

14:30.170 --> 14:31.899
HAVE YOU WATCHED
THE NEWS LATELY?

14:31.930 --> 14:33.466
MAN, WHY WOULD I WATCH
THE NEWS?

14:33.500 --> 14:36.162
LOOK AT ME. UNLESS I'M ON IT,
MAN, THAT'S NOT MY TYPE OF SHOW.

14:36.200 --> 14:38.065
DETECTIVE BARBER WAS KILLED
IN THE LINE OF DUTY.

14:38.110 --> 14:39.429
FOUR DAYS AGO.

14:39.470 --> 14:40.573
WOW.

14:40.610 --> 14:43.499
THAT'S AWFUL, MAN.
I'M... SORRY.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.575
HIS CASES WILL BE HANDED OVER
TO SOMEONE ELSE.

14:45.610 --> 14:47.339
IT MIGHT TAKE 'EM
A BIT OF TIME TO CATCH UP.

14:47.380 --> 14:48.813
WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE THINGS?

14:48.850 --> 14:50.147
TH ESE GUYS--TH EY--
THEY WANT THEIR MONEY.

14:50.190 --> 14:51.589
THEY WANT IT NOW.

14:51.620 --> 14:52.712
IF I DON'T DELIVER IT TO THEM
THIS TIME,

14:52.750 --> 14:53.978
THEY'RE GONNA KILL ME.

14:54.020 --> 14:56.011

15:01.760 --> 15:03.296
I AM REALLY SORRY

15:03.330 --> 15:05.298
THAT THIS HAPPENED
TO JERRY. I REALLY AM.

15:05.330 --> 15:07.696
BUT JUST BECAUSE HE DIDN'T
SHOW UP WITH THAT MONEY

15:07.740 --> 15:10.800
DOES NOT MEAN I DON'T NEED
THAT MONEY, ALL RIGHT?

15:10.840 --> 15:12.432
YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME OUT
TO DRY HERE.

15:12.470 --> 15:15.439
WE'RE NOT. LIKE I SAID,
YOUR FILE WILL BE TAKEN OVER.

15:15.480 --> 15:16.629
OKAY?

15:18.350 --> 15:20.545

15:20.580 --> 15:22.878
WAIT A SECOND.
WHAT ABOUT MY BROTHER?

15:22.920 --> 15:24.979
WHO'S YOUR BROTHER?

15:25.020 --> 15:26.089
MY LITTLE BROTHER GABRIEL.

15:26.120 --> 15:27.451
HE WAS AT THE APARTMENT

15:30.790 --> 15:32.724
WHAT IF THEY TOOK HIM?
WHY WOULD THEY TAKE HIM?

15:32.760 --> 15:34.728
BECAUSE THEY WANT THEIR MONEY.

15:34.760 --> 15:36.250
ALL RIGHT? AND THEY KNOW
IF THEY HAVE HIM,

15:36.300 --> 15:37.460
THEY'RE GONNA GET THEIR MONEY.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.161
HE ONLY TALKS TO ME,
AND IF THEY HAVE HIM,

15:39.200 --> 15:40.929
HE'S NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO HANDLE THAT.

15:40.970 --> 15:43.530
COME ON. PLEASE, MAN.
HE'S 16 YEARS OLD.

15:43.570 --> 15:45.435

over P.A.)

15:56.120 --> 15:58.042
COME ON. HE'S LYING.
HE'S TRYING TO PLAY US.

15:58.090 --> 15:59.239
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.

15:59.290 --> 16:01.417
WHY WOULD DRUG DEALERS
KIDNAP A KID FOR 30 GRAND?

16:01.460 --> 16:02.552
I DON'T TRUST THE GUY.

16:02.590 --> 16:04.080
WELL, WHAT IF HE REALLY
DOES HAVE A BROTHER?

16:04.130 --> 16:05.882
THERE'S NO HARM
IN CHECKING IT OUT.
FINE. I'LL GO OVER.

DRINKING ON AN EMPTY STOMACH.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.014
THANK YOU.

16:32.050 --> 16:33.779

16:33.820 --> 16:34.889

17:06.190 --> 17:08.454
YOU KNOW, HAULING THEM OUT
WHEREVER YOU ARE.

17:08.490 --> 17:10.219
I MIGHT.

17:10.260 --> 17:11.682

17:28.380 --> 17:29.904
WELL, THEY PREPARE US

HUH. LOOKS LIKE YOUR PLACE

NO SHEETS ON THE COUCH.

18:10.920 --> 18:13.582
I GUESS HIS LITTLE BROTHER
MUST SLEEP STANDING UP.

18:13.620 --> 18:16.748
LOOK, WHY WOULD HE LIE ABOUT
HAVING AN AUTISTIC BROTHER?

18:16.790 --> 18:18.326
WHY WOULD IT TOOK HIM SO LONG
TO REMEMBER?

18:18.360 --> 18:20.999
IT WAS LIKE THE LAST THING
OUT OF HIS MOUTH.
BECAUSE HE WAS DISORIENTED.

18:21.030 --> 18:22.327
AND THEN WHEN HE REALIZES

18:22.360 --> 18:24.260
WE'RE NOT IN A RUSH
TO SOLVE HIS PROBLEMS,

18:24.300 --> 18:27.167
HE SUDDENLY REMEMBERS
HIS LITTLE AUTISTIC BROTHER

18:27.200 --> 18:29.339
WHO JUST HAPPENS TO HAVE BEEN
KIDNAPPED BY THESE DRUG DEALERS.

18:29.370 --> 18:32.009
FOR WHAT? OH, THEY'RE
HOLDING HIM FOR RANSOM.

18:32.040 --> 18:33.302
BULLETPROOF STORY.

18:33.340 --> 18:34.739
HE WANTS US
TO BUST THOSE GUYS

18:34.780 --> 18:37.840
SO THEY CAN'T TRACK HIS ASS
DOWN AGAIN.

18:40.820 --> 18:41.969
COULD BE A COUSIN.

18:42.020 --> 18:43.180
IT COULD BE GABRIEL.

18:43.220 --> 18:45.916
COULD BE ANYBODY.
CYNICAL.

18:45.950 --> 18:47.258
GULLIBLE.

18:47.290 --> 18:48.450
CAN YOU THINK OF ANYWHERE ELSE
HE MIGHT BE?

18:48.490 --> 18:50.378
NO, MAN, HE WOULDN'T
GO ANYWHERE ELSE,

18:50.430 --> 18:52.523
NOT WHILE I'M LYING THERE
IN A POOL OF MY OWN BLOOD.

18:52.560 --> 18:54.858
LISTEN TO ME. THEY TOOK HIM.
ALL RIGHT? I NEED YOUR HELP.

18:54.900 --> 18:56.458
YOU CAN'T HAND THIS CASE OFF
TO ANYBODY ELSE,

18:56.500 --> 18:57.489
AND WE CAN'T WAIT ON THIS.

18:57.530 --> 18:59.168
OKAY, RELAX, ALL RIGHT?

18:59.200 --> 19:00.428
I'LL TALK TO SWAREK.

19:00.470 --> 19:01.494
(cell phone beeps)

19:01.540 --> 19:03.758
(telephone ringing)

19:03.810 --> 19:05.334
FRANK SAID TO TRY THESE.

19:07.740 --> 19:09.537
(telephone rings)

19:09.580 --> 19:11.309
WHO DO YOU THINK
THAT IS?

19:11.350 --> 19:13.841
ANYBODY. IT'S, UH...
(ﬁng)

19:13.880 --> 19:16.440
DRY CLEANING, ELECTRICIAN,
LAWYER.

19:16.480 --> 19:17.481
(ﬁng)

19:17.520 --> 19:19.044
PROSECUTOR. I DON'T KNOW.

19:19.090 --> 19:20.819
(ringing stops,
police radio chatter)

19:20.860 --> 19:24.023
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT'LL TAKE
BEFORE EVERYBODY KNOWS?

19:24.060 --> 19:26.927
UH, I-I STILL CAN'T
GET THIS OPEN.

19:26.960 --> 19:28.928
CAN'T GET WHAT OPEN?

19:28.960 --> 19:30.894
TRACI, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:30.930 --> 19:32.659
YOU SHOULDN'T--
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

19:32.700 --> 19:34.895
I KNOW. THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY
KEEPS TELLING ME, BUT...

19:34.940 --> 19:37.238
(sighs) I WAS JUST
SITTING IN THE PARKING LOT.

19:37.270 --> 19:38.339
COULDN'T LEAVE.

19:38.370 --> 19:40.031
(radio chatter)

19:41.240 --> 19:43.344
SO WHAT CAN'T YOU
GET OPEN?

19:46.180 --> 19:48.011
(keys jangle)

19:58.830 --> 20:00.457
(lock clicks)

20:03.530 --> 20:05.168
TRY IT NOW.

20:05.200 --> 20:07.634
(telephone beeps, radio chatter)

20:07.670 --> 20:09.661
THAN KS.

20:09.700 --> 20:12.703
(indistinct conversations)

20:14.240 --> 20:15.878
YOU'RE STILL HERE?

20:15.910 --> 20:18.401
YEAH. FRANK'S TRYING
TO GET ME OUT OF TOWN,

20:18.450 --> 20:20.145
YOU KNOW, TILL THEY FINISH
DEALING WITH CALVIN.

20:20.180 --> 20:22.011
(telephone rings in distance)

20:22.050 --> 20:23.915
JERRY WOULD HATE IT
IF HE THOUGHT

20:23.950 --> 20:26.180
THAT HE PUT YOUR LIFE
IN DANGER.

20:26.220 --> 20:29.519
I KNOW. (chuckles)
JERRY WAS YOUR GUY, RIGHT?

20:30.760 --> 20:32.352
YEAH. YEAH, HE WAS.

20:32.390 --> 20:34.858
I REALLY LIKED HIM.
HE WAS STRAIGHT UP WITH ME.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.198
(chuckles)

20:37.230 --> 20:39.027
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN--
I'VE BEEN FEEDING HIM

20:39.070 --> 20:40.867
INFORMATION
FOR A COUPLE YEARS NOW.

20:40.900 --> 20:42.538
HE'D ALWAYS GET ME
TO--TO MEET HIM

20:42.570 --> 20:45.209
AT SOME SNAZZY RESTAURANT...
(chuckles)

20:45.240 --> 20:46.639
ASK HOW I WAS DOING,

20:46.670 --> 20:49.400
YOU KNOW, LIKE HE REALLY
WANTED TO KNOW.

20:49.440 --> 20:53.479
(telephones ringing in distance)

20:53.520 --> 20:54.976
IT SUCKS.

20:55.020 --> 20:57.511
(footsteps approach)

20:58.490 --> 21:00.958
HEY. HOW'S GAIL DOING?

21:00.990 --> 21:03.083
PHYSICALLY
I THINK SHE'S FINE.

21:03.120 --> 21:04.519
SHE'S PRETTY SHAKEN UP?

21:04.560 --> 21:06.778
UH, SHE'S--SHE'S TOUGH.
SHE'S HANDLING IT, THOUGH.

21:06.830 --> 21:09.048
I JUST CAN'T GET
A FULL STATEMENT OUT OF HER.

21:09.100 --> 21:11.398
EVERY TIME SHE STARTS,
SHE STOPS,

21:11.430 --> 21:13.091
ESPECIALLY WHEN SHE GETS
TO THE--

21:14.100 --> 21:15.738
JERRY PART.

21:15.770 --> 21:17.328
YEAH.

21:20.070 --> 21:22.709
YOU KNOW,
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND

21:22.740 --> 21:24.048
WHY YOU GUYS HAVE
TO HAVE ME CUFFED

21:24.080 --> 21:25.843
LIKE I'M SOME KIND
OF COMMON CRIMINAL OR SOMETHING.

21:25.880 --> 21:27.313
WELL, IF SOMEBODY SEES YOU,
IT'S BETTER THEY THINK

21:27.350 --> 21:28.544
WE ARRESTED YOU FOR SOMETHING

21:28.580 --> 21:30.138
THAN YOU'RE JUST HANGING OUT
WITH THE POLICE.

21:30.180 --> 21:31.784
THIS PAL OF YOURS--
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

21:31.820 --> 21:33.242
MIKE KEATING.

21:33.290 --> 21:34.518
RUNS A SKID FACTORY
DOWN ON THE WEST END.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.585
(chuckles)
YEAH. THAT'S A FRONT.

21:36.620 --> 21:38.827
BIG-TIME, BIG-TIME PLAYER
ON THE HEROIN SCENE.

21:38.860 --> 21:40.157
AND HOW LONG YOU BEEN
DEALING FOR HIM?

21:40.190 --> 21:41.157
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.224
A COUPLE YEARS.
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

21:42.260 --> 21:43.591
(lowered voice)
I MEAN, DON'T YOU THINK

21:43.630 --> 21:44.767
WE SHOULD BE GETTING MORE
INFORMATION ON HIS BROTHER?

21:44.800 --> 21:45.994
(lowered voice)
I'M NOT CHARGING IN THERE

21:46.030 --> 21:48.089
AND JEOPARDIZING
THE CASE JERRY BUILT, OKAY?

21:48.140 --> 21:49.391
(normal voice)
IF WE'RE GONNA DO THIS,

21:49.440 --> 21:50.737
WE'RE GONNA DO IT RIGHT.
YOU'RE GONNA GO IN.

21:50.770 --> 21:52.909
YOU'RE GONNA DO THE BUY.
WE'LL MAKE THE ARREST.

21:52.940 --> 21:54.874
IF THERE IS A BROTHER,
WE'LL FIND HIM THAT WAY.

21:54.910 --> 21:56.537
OKAY.

21:56.580 --> 21:59.071
(radio chatter)

22:00.250 --> 22:03.014
SO JERRY WAS GIVING HIM $30,000
TO MAKE THE BUY.

22:03.050 --> 22:05.985
NOT A HUGE BUY,
BUT IF WE CAN GET IT ON TAPE,

22:06.020 --> 22:07.146
IT'LL GIVE US AN EXCUSE
TO COME BACK

22:07.190 --> 22:09.078
WITH E.T.F.
AND TEAR THE PLACE APART.

22:09.120 --> 22:11.657
YOU SURE WE CAN TRUST
THIS GUY?

22:11.690 --> 22:13.954
WHO SAYS I TRUST HIM?

22:14.000 --> 22:15.399
(door buzzes and beeps)

22:15.430 --> 22:19.025
OKAY, DALE.
LET'S GET YOU WIRED UP.

22:19.070 --> 22:20.594
(chuckles) OH, NO.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.528
(door closes)
NO, NO, NO.

22:22.570 --> 22:25.061
NO WIRES, MAN. WHEN I STARTED
THIS THING WITH BARBER,

22:25.110 --> 22:26.964
I TOLD HIM, "NO WIRES."

22:27.010 --> 22:28.375
THESE GUYS WILL SMELL THAT
A MILE AWAY.

22:28.410 --> 22:29.832
IT'S NOT UP FOR DEBATE.

22:29.880 --> 22:31.939
THEN I AIN'T GOING IN, MAN.
THAT'S--THAT'S IT.

22:31.980 --> 22:33.004
THAT SIMPLE.
YEAH?

22:33.050 --> 22:35.712
NO, MAN. IT--
IT IS WAY TOO DANGEROUS.

22:35.750 --> 22:37.684
(door buzzes and beeps)
YOUR CHOICE.
TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.

22:37.720 --> 22:39.119
(sighs)
(door closes)

22:39.150 --> 22:40.959
YOU CAN DO THIS, OKAY?

22:40.990 --> 22:42.719
WE'RE GONNA BE THERE.
WE'RE GONNA BE LISTENING.

22:42.760 --> 22:43.784
(sighs)

22:43.830 --> 22:44.819
SWAREK'S DONE THIS
A MILLION TIMES.

22:44.860 --> 22:46.259
YOU CAN TRUST HIM.

22:46.290 --> 22:47.655
I'M GONNA GET TOO NERVOUS,
YOU KNOW? I'M GONNA BLOW IT.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.759
THEY'LL... (sighs)
SHOOT ME.
WELL--

22:49.800 --> 22:52.325
WELL, THEN WHY DON'T YOU
THINK ABOUT GABRIEL?

22:52.370 --> 22:53.962
MAYBE YOU CAN PULL IT
TOGETHER FOR HIM.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.992
(sighing)

22:59.210 --> 23:01.337
ALL RIGHT. WHATEVER.
FINE. I'LL DO IT.

23:01.380 --> 23:02.404
GREAT.

23:02.440 --> 23:04.146
ALL RIGHT.
STAND UP FOR ME, PLEASE.

23:04.180 --> 23:05.340
(sighs)

23:05.380 --> 23:08.372
(siren wailing in distance)

23:10.920 --> 23:11.887
(knock on door)

23:11.920 --> 23:13.558
UGH. WHO IS IT?

23:13.590 --> 23:17.549
(people speaking indistinctly)

23:17.590 --> 23:19.888
OH. UH...

23:19.930 --> 23:22.228
HEY. HEY. (sighs)

23:22.960 --> 23:25.269
IS THIS A GOOD TIME?

23:25.300 --> 23:26.699
YEAH. UH...

23:27.770 --> 23:30.603
(voice breaking) I'VE BEEN
MEANING TO--TO CALL YOU.

23:30.640 --> 23:34.076
(telephone rings in distance)

23:34.110 --> 23:35.236
(door closes)

23:35.280 --> 23:37.100
I WANTED TO SEE HOW
YOU WERE DOING.

23:37.140 --> 23:39.700
(chuckles and sniffles)
MY GOD.

23:39.750 --> 23:44.380
WHO CARES HOW I'M FEELING?
I MEAN, YOU MUST BE, UM...

23:44.420 --> 23:46.240
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M JUST, LIKE...

23:46.290 --> 23:48.758
I'M JUST TIRED. THAT'S IT.
(whispers) JUST TIRED.

23:48.790 --> 23:51.258
I KNOW. (sighs)

23:51.290 --> 23:53.155
I WISH I COULD SLEEP.

23:54.530 --> 23:57.328
(sighs) I NEED TO SHUT
MY BRAIN OFF.

23:58.870 --> 24:00.690
ARE YOU OKAY?

24:01.840 --> 24:03.637
(voice breaking)
YEAH. I'M OKAY.

24:07.010 --> 24:10.275
JUST... FEELING, UM...

24:12.550 --> 24:13.778
GAIL.

24:16.580 --> 24:18.081
YOU CAN LOOK AT ME.

24:19.750 --> 24:21.388
YOU CAN LOOK AT ME.

24:21.420 --> 24:23.183
(whispering) I CAN'T.

24:23.890 --> 24:25.721
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

24:26.560 --> 24:29.529
(crying) YES--YES, IT IS.
(sniffles)

24:31.170 --> 24:34.059
(sniffles)
HIS PHONE SAVED MY LIFE,

24:34.100 --> 24:36.159
AND IF IT WASN'T FOR ME,

24:36.200 --> 24:38.703
HE WOULD STILL HAVE IT,
AND HE--

24:38.740 --> 24:42.471
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE
TO CALL FOR HELP, SO...

24:42.510 --> 24:44.398
WELL,
THAT'S JUST WHO JERRY IS.

24:46.910 --> 24:48.673
JERRY WAS.

24:52.020 --> 24:53.749
YOU CAN'T BLAME YOURSELF
FOR THAT.

24:53.790 --> 24:55.485
BUT NOW EVERY TIME
YOU LOOK AT ME,

24:55.520 --> 24:57.727
YOU ARE GONNA BE REMINDED

24:58.530 --> 25:00.589
OF WHY YOUR FIANCE DIED.

25:02.900 --> 25:04.527
NO.

25:05.770 --> 25:07.931
I'M GONNA BE REMINDED...

25:08.940 --> 25:11.602
THAT HIS DEATH MEANT
SOMETHING...

25:13.440 --> 25:16.079
AND THAT HE DIED
FOR SOMETHING IMPORTANT.

25:19.910 --> 25:21.719
I...

25:21.750 --> 25:23.547
I WANT TO HELP YOU.

25:23.590 --> 25:24.716
I WANT TO--
I WANT TO DO SOMETHING.

25:24.750 --> 25:27.048
WHAT--WHAT CAN I DO
FOR YOU?

25:29.920 --> 25:31.888
I NEED YOU TO COME WITH ME.

25:35.100 --> 25:37.489
'CAUSE I COULD USE
A FRIEND NOW.

25:37.530 --> 25:39.589
(mouths word)

25:43.400 --> 25:46.233
SILVER WATCH.

25:46.270 --> 25:48.830
UH, LEATHER WALLET.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.802
(clatters)

25:50.850 --> 25:52.841
(photograph rustles)

25:52.880 --> 25:54.677
OLD PICTURE.

25:56.180 --> 25:58.489
OH, MAN. CHECK IT OUT.
(sighs)

25:58.520 --> 26:01.318
THOSE GUYS HAVE BEEN WORKING
TOGETHER A LONG TIME.

26:01.360 --> 26:05.057
THIS IS IT, MAN.
THIS IS THE JOB.

26:05.090 --> 26:07.388
THIS COULD HAPPEN
TO ONE OF US.

26:07.430 --> 26:10.126
(man speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

26:10.160 --> 26:12.560
LISTEN,
PROMISE ME SOMETHING.
(clatters)

26:12.600 --> 26:13.737
NO MATTER
WHAT YOUR RANK IS,

26:13.770 --> 26:15.397
YOU'LL VOLUNTEER
TO CLEAR OUT MY DESK,

26:15.440 --> 26:17.431
AND I'LL DO THE SAME
FOR YOU.

26:18.610 --> 26:20.009
DEAL.

26:20.040 --> 26:21.405
THIS WAY I DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY.

26:21.440 --> 26:23.078
I CAN KEEP HIDING
MY MOUTH GUARD IN MY DESK.

26:23.110 --> 26:25.943
(chuckles)
SECRET'S SAFE WITH ME, BRO.

26:27.080 --> 26:29.219
(grunts)

26:29.250 --> 26:32.219
***

26:32.250 --> 26:34.389
MM.

26:34.420 --> 26:37.389
HEY. OH, GAIL, WE GOTTA FIND YOU
SOMEWHERE ELSE TO SIT.

26:37.420 --> 26:41.220
THIS... IS JERRY'S SEAT.
HERE. COME HERE.

26:41.260 --> 26:44.889
THAT IS JERRY'S SCOTCH.
THEM ARE JERRY'S PEANUTS.

26:44.930 --> 26:47.398
YEAH, BUT JERRY'S ALLERGIC
TO PEANUTS,

26:47.430 --> 26:49.091
SO WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO DO, KILL HIM?

26:49.140 --> 26:50.937
(chuckles) A SENSE OF HUMOR.

26:50.970 --> 26:54.133
(chuckles) UH... OKAY.
UH, YOU'RE HERE.

26:54.180 --> 26:56.330
THAT MEANS THAT
THE PARTY IS STARTING.

26:56.380 --> 26:58.302
WE GOTTA GET YOU GUYS
A COUPLE OF THESE.

26:59.850 --> 27:01.875
IT IS--IT IS HELPING.

27:01.920 --> 27:04.787
YOU KNOW WHAT JERRY DID
LAST WEEK?

27:04.820 --> 27:06.742
JERRY BOUGHT ME
FIVE PAIRS OF UNDERWEAR.

27:06.790 --> 27:09.281
YEAH, HE SAW THAT I WAS WEARING
THOSE, UH, BRIEFS.

27:09.320 --> 27:12.118
YOU KNOW THE ONES,
THE NORMAL ONES,

27:12.160 --> 27:14.628
AND, UH, HE SAID
WOMEN DIDN'T LIKE THOSE ANYMORE,

27:14.660 --> 27:16.799
THAT MAYBE THAT'S WHY
MY WIFE LEFT ME,

27:16.830 --> 27:19.799
SO HE BOUGHT ME FIVE PAIRS.
STRIPED.

27:19.830 --> 27:21.297
I'M WEARING 'EM NOW.
YOU GOTTA SEE THESE THINGS.

27:21.340 --> 27:23.069
THAT'S OKAY, OLIVER.
THAT'S OKAY.

27:23.100 --> 27:24.636
OKAY. JUST SAYING,
IT TAKES A GREAT MAN

27:24.670 --> 27:27.138
TO TELL HIS FRIEND
WHEN TO CHANGE HIS UNDERWEAR.

27:27.170 --> 27:29.331
I HAD TO FEED MY BABY
IN HIDING

27:29.380 --> 27:32.975
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
TO OFFEND MR. PRUDISH HERE.

27:33.010 --> 27:34.375
I THINK HE'S GETTING
A LITTLE LESS PRUDISH.

27:34.420 --> 27:36.240
HE WAS ABOUT TO FLASH US
HIS GINCH.

27:36.280 --> 27:37.941
OHH.
(chuckles)

27:37.990 --> 27:39.287
(whispers) HI, SWEETHEART.

27:39.320 --> 27:41.413
MM.

27:41.460 --> 27:42.916
HOW ARE YOU?

27:43.560 --> 27:45.152
NUMB.

27:45.990 --> 27:48.220
ASK ME AGAIN
IN FIVE MINUTES.

27:48.260 --> 27:50.399
(clicks tongue)

27:50.430 --> 27:52.091
(whispers) COME HERE.

27:52.130 --> 27:55.133
***

27:55.170 --> 27:56.728
(Nick) THIS CAR Is
HIGHLY INCONSPICUOUS.

27:56.770 --> 27:59.068
(Andy chuckles)
(Sam) WELL, BEGGARS CAN'T
BE CHOOSERS, PAL.

27:59.110 --> 28:01.635
IT'S NOT LIKE 15 DIVISION
HAS A PLETH-ORE-A

28:01.680 --> 28:05.138
OF UNMARKED CARS SITTING AROUND,
ESPECIALLY ON SHORT NOTICE.

28:05.180 --> 28:07.171
I THINK YOU MEANT "PLETHORA."

28:08.450 --> 28:09.849
THERE HE IS.

28:26.570 --> 28:28.629
(beeps)

28:28.670 --> 28:30.297
(Dale) HEY, MIKE. (chuckles)
WHAT'S HAPPENING, MAN?

28:30.340 --> 28:31.568
(Mike)
OH, WELL, LOOK WHO IT IS.

28:31.610 --> 28:32.861
(man) WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR FACE, DALE?

28:32.910 --> 28:33.979
NOT SO PRETTY ANYMORE.
YOU GET IN A FIGHT?

28:34.010 --> 28:35.329
DON'T WORRY.
I GOT THE MESSAGE,

28:35.380 --> 28:36.335
AND--AND I'M HERE
TO MAKE IT RIGHT, YOU KNOW?

28:36.380 --> 28:37.745
WE--WE HAD AN AGREEMENT,

28:37.780 --> 28:40.146
AND--AND I'M GOOD FOR IT.
YOU--YOU CAN TRUST ME.

28:40.180 --> 28:41.818
HE'S TOO NERVOUS.
WHERE'S MY MONEY?

28:41.850 --> 28:43.477
EITHER THAT, OR HE'S TRYING
TO TIP 'EM OFF.

28:43.520 --> 28:44.714
YOU GOT IT AND BROUGHT IT
OR YOU DIDN'T,

28:44.750 --> 28:45.842
AND IF YOU DIDN'T--
OF COURSE I BROUGHT IT.

28:45.890 --> 28:47.414
I JUST NEED TO HIT THE CAN.
NO, NO, NO.

28:47.450 --> 28:49.315
HEY, NO WAY.
MIKE, COME ON. COME ON.

28:49.360 --> 28:52.227
I GOT YOUR MONEY. I JUST...
LET ME TAKE A LEAK FIRST.

28:52.260 --> 28:53.852
WHAT IS HE DOING?

28:53.900 --> 28:54.855
(radio static)

28:54.900 --> 28:55.958
WHAT'S GOING ON?

28:56.000 --> 28:58.059
THE WIRE IS DOWN.

28:58.100 --> 28:59.067
(turns off receiver)

28:59.100 --> 29:00.727
(sighs)
I HOPE THAT SLIMEBALL

29:00.770 --> 29:03.261
IS NOT CLIMBING OUT THE WINDOW
RIGHT NOW WITH OUR 30 GRAND.

29:03.300 --> 29:04.767
DAMN IT.
NOW WE GOTTA GO IN THERE.

29:04.810 --> 29:06.129
OKAY.
I'LL GO IN. I'LL CHECK IT OUT.

29:06.170 --> 29:08.172
MCNALLY, YOU DON'T KNOW WHY
THE WIRE'S DOWN.

29:08.210 --> 29:09.336
YEAH, WELL, HE MIGHT BE
IN TROUBLE.

29:09.380 --> 29:10.938
YEAH. HE MIGHT HAVE TAKEN
IT OFF HIMSELF.

29:10.980 --> 29:12.174
LOOK, IT'S A PLACE OF BUSINESS.

29:12.210 --> 29:13.871
I'LL JUST GO AND ASK
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS.

29:13.920 --> 29:16.047
THEY SELL WOODEN PALLETS.

29:16.080 --> 29:17.274
I'LL IMPROVISE.

29:18.320 --> 29:21.050
KEEP THE RADIO OPEN
SO WE CAN HEAR EVERYTHING.

29:21.090 --> 29:22.216
IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG,
YOU LET US KNOW.

29:22.260 --> 29:23.215
ALL RIGHT.
YOU HEAR ME?

29:23.260 --> 29:25.820
YEAH. YOU'RE RIGHT THERE.

29:32.370 --> 29:36.636
I'M JUST A GIRL LOOKIN'
TO BUY SOME WOOD PALLETS.

29:36.670 --> 29:39.002
NOTHIN' WEIRD HERE.

29:42.780 --> 29:43.735
GAME PLAN?

29:43.780 --> 29:45.509
WE MOVE, HEAD AROUND BACK.

29:45.550 --> 29:48.713
LET'S HOPE TO HELL
SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE'S DOING.

29:58.760 --> 30:00.819
(door closes)

30:00.860 --> 30:02.122
CAN I HELP YOU?

30:02.160 --> 30:05.095
YES. UH, I'M GUESSING
YOU SELL PALLETS.

30:05.130 --> 30:06.097
AM I RIGHT?

30:06.130 --> 30:07.097
YES.

30:07.130 --> 30:09.166
I NEED TO PRICE THEM.

30:09.870 --> 30:12.236
HERE'S OUR PRICE LIST.

30:12.270 --> 30:15.671
THEY'RE SO EXPENSIVE.
UH, I ONLY NEED TW-TWO.

30:15.710 --> 30:17.849
(Mike)
TIME IS UP, DALE! COME ON!
(pounding on door)

30:17.880 --> 30:19.802
WE DON'T SELL THEM
INDIVIDUALLY, ACTUALLY.
(shouting indistinctly)

30:19.850 --> 30:21.044
(Dale speaking indistinctly)
REALLY?

30:21.080 --> 30:22.570
UH, WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN
MAKE AN EXCEPTION.

30:22.620 --> 30:24.087
UH, CAN I SPEAK
WITH YOUR MANAGER?

30:24.120 --> 30:25.189
HE'S NOT HERE.

30:27.250 --> 30:28.615
WELL, SOMEBODY'S
BACK THERE.

30:28.660 --> 30:32.152
NO! HEY, WAIT! MIKE!
NO, YOU CAN'T GO BACK THERE!

30:33.730 --> 30:35.857
(Andy) Sam, I need backup.
They found the wire.

30:35.900 --> 30:36.958
(beeps)

30:37.000 --> 30:38.194
ALL RIGHT. ANYBODY COMES OUT
THE BACK DOOR,

30:38.230 --> 30:40.528
YOU TAKE 'EM DOWN, YEAH?

30:40.570 --> 30:41.662
YES, SIR.

30:41.700 --> 30:42.997
(Dale) DON'T DO IT, MAN.
LOOK--AAH.

30:43.040 --> 30:44.234
THEY MADE ME WEAR
THE WIRE.

30:44.270 --> 30:46.158
THAT'S WHY I FLUSHED IT DOWN
THE TOILET, MAN.

30:46.210 --> 30:47.165
AAH. I WASN'T GONNA RAT
ON YOU GUYS.

30:47.210 --> 30:48.575
(speaks indistinctly)
(grunts)

30:48.610 --> 30:50.407
(man) KNOCK HIM OUT, MIKE!
POLICE!

30:50.440 --> 30:51.941
(speaks indistinctly)
PUT YOUR HANDS UP NOW!

30:51.980 --> 30:54.949
(panﬁng)

30:54.980 --> 30:56.277
DALE!

30:56.320 --> 30:58.117
YOU! (grunts)
(grunts)

30:58.150 --> 30:59.378
(woman) OHH.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA!

30:59.420 --> 31:01.081
DON'T MOVE.
GET DOWN ON YOUR KNEES.
(grunts)

31:01.120 --> 31:02.678
PUT YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEAD.

31:02.720 --> 31:04.859
(handcuffs clicking)

31:04.890 --> 31:06.585
(grunts)

31:10.560 --> 31:12.289
ANDY, WHERE'S DALE?

31:12.330 --> 31:14.798
(panﬁng)
(grunts)

31:14.840 --> 31:18.537
(panﬁng)

31:20.740 --> 31:23.231
(pants and grunts)

31:23.280 --> 31:26.875
(both grunt)

31:26.910 --> 31:28.775
(pants) HEY, BRO.

31:28.820 --> 31:31.948
(grunts and groans)

31:31.990 --> 31:33.958
(handcuffs clicking)
WHY'D YOU RUN, BROTHER?

31:33.990 --> 31:35.287
(grunts)
AAH!

31:35.320 --> 31:38.289
(radio chatter, camera beeping
and shutter clicking)

31:38.330 --> 31:41.322
(indistinct conversations)

31:46.830 --> 31:50.129
LOOKS LIKE ALMOST $2 MILLION
IN STREET VALUE.

31:50.170 --> 31:51.808
A NICE LITTLE GIFT,

31:51.840 --> 31:55.230
COURTESY
OF DETECTIVE JERRY BARBER.

31:55.280 --> 31:57.874
GUYS?
GUYS, THIS WAS BARBER'S CASE.

31:57.910 --> 31:59.775
MAKE SURE HE GETS
THE CREDIT, ALL RIGHT?

32:03.320 --> 32:04.412
(exhales deeply)
HEY.

32:04.450 --> 32:06.782
NICK IS, UH, TAKING DALE
BACK TO THE STATION.

32:06.820 --> 32:08.048
UM, IF GABRIEL WAS HERE,

32:08.090 --> 32:09.387
I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE
THEY WOULD HAVE PUT HIM.

32:09.420 --> 32:11.888
THE DRUG SQUAD HAS TURNED
THIS PLACE UPSIDE DOWN, OKAY?

32:11.930 --> 32:13.921
HE'S NOT HERE. HE NEVER WAS.

32:13.960 --> 32:16.190
I SUGGEST YOU GO QUESTION
YOUR GUY DALE AGAIN,

32:16.230 --> 32:17.857
SEE WHERE ELSE
HIS SNUFFLEUPAGUS BROTHER

32:17.900 --> 32:18.889
MIGHT BE, OKAY?

32:18.930 --> 32:21.239
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

32:21.270 --> 32:23.898
LOOK, IF HE'S OUT THERE,
WE NEED TO GO FIND HIM.

32:23.940 --> 32:26.306
WE ARE NOT
ONE PERSON, OKAY?

32:26.340 --> 32:29.707
I AM TIRED OF FOLLOWING AROUND
THE VOICE INSIDE YOUR HEAD.

32:29.740 --> 32:31.048
I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED
TO JERRY THE OTHER NIGHT.

32:31.080 --> 32:32.547
INSTEAD, I LISTENED TO YOU.

32:32.580 --> 32:35.276
ARE YOU BLAMING ME
FOR JERRY?

32:35.320 --> 32:38.539
I BLAME MYSELF, OKAY,
BECAUSE I'M STUPID ENOUGH

32:38.590 --> 32:39.716
TO GET INTO THE HABIT
OF LISTENING

32:39.750 --> 32:42.787
TO A ROOKIE'S INSTINCTS
INSTEAD OF MY OWN.

32:42.820 --> 32:44.959
(sighs)

32:44.990 --> 32:46.389
I-I JUST--
I REALLY JUST NEEDED

32:46.430 --> 32:48.990
TO STAY AWAY FROM YOU
FOR A LITTLE, OKAY,

32:49.030 --> 32:50.520
BUT YOU HAD TO SUCK ME
INTO YOUR DAY.

32:50.560 --> 32:52.289
I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE.

32:57.340 --> 32:59.137
(indistinct conversations,
radio chatter)

32:59.170 --> 33:00.808
HEY, ANY LUCK?

33:00.840 --> 33:02.637
WELL, I PUT IN A COUPLE CALLS,
FOUND OUT WHAT I COULD

33:02.680 --> 33:04.648
ABOUT DALE'S BROTHER GABRIEL.
AND?

33:04.680 --> 33:06.477
SWAREK WAS RIGHT.
HE'S BEEN PLAYING US.

33:06.510 --> 33:07.772
THERE IS NO BROTHER.

33:07.810 --> 33:09.277
NO. THAT'S NOT TRUE.

33:09.320 --> 33:10.776
NICK, THE GUY WAS LOOKING ME
RIGHT IN THE EYES.

33:10.820 --> 33:13.539
HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH.
I SAW THE KID'S PICTURE MYSELF.

33:13.590 --> 33:17.583
WELL, THERE WAS A BROTHER,
BUT HE DIED... FIVE YEARS AGO.

33:17.620 --> 33:18.928
(telephone rings in distance)

33:18.960 --> 33:19.927
(thud)

33:19.960 --> 33:20.927
(door buzzes and beeps)

33:20.960 --> 33:24.691
(indistinct conversations)

33:24.730 --> 33:25.822
(door closes)

33:25.870 --> 33:27.895
COME ON NOW.
DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.

33:27.930 --> 33:28.999
YOU GUYS GOT
WHAT YOU WANTED.

33:29.040 --> 33:30.359
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

33:30.400 --> 33:32.664
WE TRUSTED YOU.
JERRY TRUSTED YOU.

33:32.710 --> 33:35.031
MIKE FOUND ME DITCHING THE WIRE,
SO I MADE A RUN FOR IT. WHAT?

33:35.080 --> 33:36.638
I MEAN, I KNEW YOU GUYS
WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME.

33:36.680 --> 33:38.204
I BELIEVED YOU.

33:38.250 --> 33:41.174
I BELIEVED YOU HAD A BROTHER,
AND NOW I LOOK LIKE A FOOL.

33:41.220 --> 33:44.781
YEAH, WELL, I DIDN'T LIE.
MY BROTHER IS GONE.

33:44.820 --> 33:46.617
MAYBE I WANTED TO BE
ONE OF THE GOOD GUYS FOR HIM.

33:46.650 --> 33:48.982
(scoffs) SAVE IT.

33:53.790 --> 33:58.363
***

34:02.470 --> 34:03.437
(Traci)
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

34:03.470 --> 34:04.505
HEY, TRACI.

34:04.540 --> 34:06.462
YEAH? (whispers) OKAY.

34:06.510 --> 34:07.659
(women) YEAH.
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU,

34:07.710 --> 34:10.372
BUT DOV AND I FOUND
A FEW THINGS ON JERRY'S DESK

34:10.410 --> 34:11.707
WE THOUGHT YOU MIGHT WANT.

34:11.750 --> 34:15.379
UH, ALSO, I FOUND SOMETHING
THAT I'D LIKE TO KEEP,

34:15.420 --> 34:18.184
UM, BUT IF YOU DON'T
WANT ME TO, I UNDERSTAND.

34:18.220 --> 34:19.812
WHAT IS IT?

34:19.850 --> 34:22.387
UH, PRITOM. HIS KID.

34:24.060 --> 34:25.948
HIS FOSTER CHILD.

34:29.900 --> 34:32.118
JERRY WAS SPONSORING
THIS KID?

34:32.170 --> 34:33.967
I WAS THINKING
THE DIVISION COULD CONTINUE

34:34.000 --> 34:36.537
TO SPONSOR HIM,
IN HONOR OF JERRY.

34:36.570 --> 34:40.233
ALSO, WE, UH, FOUND THIS.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.675
(paper rustles)

34:49.120 --> 34:50.075
ARE YOU OKAY?

34:50.120 --> 34:51.747
YEAH. I'M FINE.

34:51.790 --> 34:53.542
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY GO TALK
TO GAIL.

34:57.090 --> 35:00.253
(glasses clinking)

35:03.260 --> 35:05.125
(Nick) HEY.
HEY.

35:05.170 --> 35:06.626
YOU'RE OUT.

35:06.670 --> 35:08.160
YEAH. I'M OUT.

35:08.200 --> 35:11.909
AHEM. UH, NOW THAT, UH,
WE'RE ALL HERE,

35:11.940 --> 35:17.298
I'D LIKE TO MAKE A TOAST
TO, UM, TO JERRY.

35:17.340 --> 35:21.106
HE WAS A GOOD MAN
AND A GOOD COP.

35:22.020 --> 35:23.908
I NEVER GOT TO TELL HIM THAT.

35:23.950 --> 35:26.111
(voice breaking)
SO, UM, I'D JUST--

35:26.150 --> 35:29.950
I'D LIKE TO SAY, UH...
I WANT TO...

35:29.990 --> 35:31.321
JERRY...

35:32.490 --> 35:34.958
SCREW IT, BUDDY. I'M DRINKING
YOUR SCOTCH, MY MAN.

35:35.000 --> 35:35.955
(women chuckle)
JERRY!

35:36.000 --> 35:38.867
(all) JERRY.

35:38.900 --> 35:39.889
(bottle clatters)

35:39.930 --> 35:43.798
ACTUALLY, UH,
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY.

35:44.940 --> 35:46.567
UM...

35:47.170 --> 35:51.243
CHRIS AND DOV FOUND THIS.

35:51.280 --> 35:55.410
(sighs) IT'S THE SPEECH THAT
JERRY WROTE FOR OUR WEDDING.

35:57.650 --> 35:59.186
(paper rustles)

35:59.220 --> 36:03.316
(sighs, voice breaks)
SO... HERE GOES.

36:04.830 --> 36:07.287
"THANK YOU FOR COMING.
I'LL MAKE IT SHORT

36:07.330 --> 36:10.299
"SO WE CAN GET TO THE PARTYING,
BUT WHO AM I KIDDING?

36:10.330 --> 36:12.924
"SOME OF YOU ARE PROBABLY
ALREADY DRUNK...

36:12.970 --> 36:13.925
OLIVER."

36:13.970 --> 36:15.790
(woman chuckles)

36:15.840 --> 36:18.661
(voice breaking)
"I AM THE LUCKIEST MAN ALIVE."

36:20.610 --> 36:25.547
"I DON'T JUST HAVE GOOD FRIENDS.
I HAVE GREAT FRIENDS.

36:25.580 --> 36:27.969
"NOELLE, THANKS FOR HELPING ME

36:28.010 --> 36:30.570
"MAKE THE PLAYLIST
FOR THIS LITTLE SHINDIG.

36:30.620 --> 36:32.781
"GOTTA BE HONEST, THOUGH.
WHEN YOU WEREN'T LOOKING,

36:32.820 --> 36:35.709
I DID SNEAK THE 'MACARENA'
BACK ON THERE."

36:35.760 --> 36:37.318
(laughter)

36:37.360 --> 36:39.123
(chuckles)

36:41.090 --> 36:43.297
"OLLIE, YOU KNOW
YOU'RE MY BROTHER."

36:44.770 --> 36:45.725
(voice breaking)
"I CAN ONLY HOPE THAT

36:45.770 --> 36:48.466
"I'M HALF THE HUSBAND YOU ARE

36:48.500 --> 36:50.889
AND, WHEN THE TIME COMES,
HALF THE DAD."

36:55.610 --> 36:57.407
(crying) JUST so YOU GUYS KNOW,
CRYING OR NOT,

36:57.440 --> 36:59.704
I AM GONNA READ THIS WHOLE
DAMN THING. (chuckles)

37:03.050 --> 37:05.917
"SAMMY. THE BEST MAN.

37:05.950 --> 37:09.181
"NO TRUER WORDS WERE
EVER SPOKEN.

37:09.220 --> 37:11.950
I TRUST YOU WITH MY LIFE
BECAUSE..."

37:11.990 --> 37:13.958
(voice breaks)
"BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

37:13.990 --> 37:16.629
"I KNOW YOU'LL ALWAYS HAVE
MY BACK.

37:16.660 --> 37:18.662
I LOVE YOU, MAN."

37:27.110 --> 37:29.305
(voice breaks) "AND TO
MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE TRACI..."

37:29.340 --> 37:33.106
(crying)

37:39.290 --> 37:43.556
"AND TO MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE TRACI,

37:43.590 --> 37:46.229
"YOU AREN'T JUST PART
OF MY LIFE.

37:46.260 --> 37:48.455
"YOU ARE MY LIFE.

37:48.500 --> 37:52.869
"YOU HAVE TAKEN THIS SIMPLE MAN
AND MADE HIM A KING.

37:52.900 --> 37:54.868
"UNTIL THE DAY I DIE,

37:54.900 --> 37:57.789
YOU WILL ALWAYS HOLD THE KEY
TO MY HEART."

38:14.420 --> 38:17.651
(indistinct conversations)

38:27.170 --> 38:29.138
HEY.

38:29.170 --> 38:31.638
YOU WERE RIGHT.

38:31.670 --> 38:33.331
THE GUY WAS PLAYING ME.

38:34.070 --> 38:35.469
SORRY.

38:35.510 --> 38:38.445
YOU KNOW, FOR THE RECORD,
I WOULD DO IT AGAIN,

38:38.480 --> 38:39.902
'CAUSE IF THERE'S EVEN
A SMALL CHANCE

38:39.950 --> 38:40.939
THAT HE WAS TELLING
THE TRUTH--

38:40.980 --> 38:42.618
I KNOW.

38:42.650 --> 38:45.039
YOU'RE RIGHT.
(clears throat)

38:45.090 --> 38:46.648
IT'S OUR JOB.

38:47.390 --> 38:48.550
(horn honks in distance)

38:48.590 --> 38:50.251
(voice breaking)
I KNOW YOU'RE GRIEVING...

38:51.860 --> 38:54.397
AND I KNOW WE ALL GRIEVE
IN OUR OWN WAY,

38:55.430 --> 38:57.352
BUT DON'T TAKE THIS OUT
ON ME.

38:57.400 --> 39:00.563
I-I DID TAKE IT OUT ON YOU.

39:00.600 --> 39:01.589
I'M SORRY.

39:02.440 --> 39:04.294
IF YOU REALLY BLAME ME
FOR JERRY--

39:04.340 --> 39:05.534
I DON'T. I DON'T.

39:05.570 --> 39:08.209
WELL, THEN WHY ARE YOU
SO MAD AT ME?

39:08.240 --> 39:10.003
I'M NOT MAD.

39:12.350 --> 39:16.013
I JUST CAN'T--I CAN'T DO
THIS ANYMORE.

39:16.050 --> 39:17.278
CAN'T DO WHAT?

39:19.320 --> 39:22.153
I CAN'T BE A COP
AND BE WITH YOU.

39:22.190 --> 39:24.658
SAM, THIS IS NOT ABOUT
OUR JOB.

39:24.690 --> 39:27.158
WE KNEW THIS WAS TROUBLE
EVEN BEFORE WE STARTED, OKAY?
OKAY, LOOK,

39:27.190 --> 39:29.624
I-I'M TRYING TO TALK
TO YOU, OKAY?

39:29.660 --> 39:31.127
I-I WANT TO GO THROUGH THIS
WITH YOU.

39:31.160 --> 39:32.525
I KNOW YOU'RE HURTING.

39:32.570 --> 39:35.630
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.
MAYBE I'M NOT MYSELF.

39:35.670 --> 39:37.797
I DON'T KNOW, OKAY?

39:37.840 --> 39:39.808
BUT THIS IS MY FEELING

39:39.840 --> 39:44.470
IN MY GUT RIGHT NOW,
ALL RIGHT?

39:44.510 --> 39:46.808
I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.

39:46.850 --> 39:47.976
(William Fitzsimmons'
"By My Side" playing)

39:48.010 --> 39:50.012
NO. YOU DON'T MEAN THIS.

39:54.150 --> 39:56.118
SOMEDAY WE'LL BE ABLE TO BE
FRIENDS AGAIN.

39:56.160 --> 39:58.958
(voice breaking)
DON'T! DON'T DO THAT.

39:58.990 --> 40:01.129
DON'T TAKE EVERYTHING
THAT WE ARE

40:01.160 --> 40:02.798
AND--AND BUTTON UP
OUR RELATIONSHIP

40:02.830 --> 40:05.128
WITH SOME STUPID CLICHE.

40:05.170 --> 40:08.799
* I STILL HEAR YOU CALLING *

40:08.840 --> 40:10.296
(crying)
ARE YOU SAYING IT'S OVER?

40:10.340 --> 40:14.879
* WHEN SLEEP IS ESCAPING ME *

40:14.910 --> 40:20.644
* I STILL HEAR YOU FARTHER ON *

40:20.680 --> 40:22.671
THEN LEAVE.

40:24.350 --> 40:25.942
OKAY? JUST GET
IN YOUR TRUCK AND GO.

40:25.990 --> 40:29.619
* IN WAKING *

40:29.660 --> 40:32.356
* A GHOST IN THE WINDOW SHADE *

40:32.390 --> 40:33.357
(sobs)

40:33.390 --> 40:35.620
* MY LOVER *

40:35.660 --> 40:36.627
(truck door opens)

40:36.660 --> 40:38.127
(crying)

40:38.160 --> 40:39.889
(door closes)

40:39.930 --> 40:40.897
(engine starts)

40:40.930 --> 40:44.434
* BY MY SIDE *

40:44.470 --> 40:46.233
UH... (sighs)

40:46.270 --> 40:47.737
* WALK WITH ME *

40:47.770 --> 40:48.907
(voice breaking)
WHEN I WOKE UP THIS MORNING,

40:48.940 --> 40:51.431
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T--
I...

40:51.480 --> 40:53.072
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HOW
I WAS GONNA GET OUT OF BED...

40:53.110 --> 40:55.112
(sighs) BUT...

40:55.150 --> 40:56.572
* BY MY SIDE *

40:56.620 --> 40:59.088
I LOOK AROUND THIS ROOM,
AND...

41:01.090 --> 41:04.355
AND I SEE THAT I'M NOT ALONE.

41:05.660 --> 41:08.128
NONE OF US ARE...

41:08.160 --> 41:09.923
(sighs) SO...

41:10.830 --> 41:13.492
PLEASE, EVERYBODY, JUST, UH...
(sighs)

41:15.000 --> 41:18.834
RAISE A GLASS TO MY HUSBAND.
(cryrng)

41:19.840 --> 41:20.829
(sighs)

41:23.180 --> 41:28.379
* WE DANCE THROUGH THE EVENING *

41:28.410 --> 41:32.949
* YOU FEATHER AROUND MY TOES *

41:32.990 --> 41:39.554
* I STILL HEAR THE WORDS
YOU PLED *

41:39.590 --> 41:44.391
* BY MY SIDE *

41:44.430 --> 41:47.627
* WALK WITH ME *

41:49.040 --> 41:52.806
* MAKE THIS WELL *

41:53.910 --> 41:58.199

42:05.820 --> 42:10.450

42:13.330 --> 42:16.299
