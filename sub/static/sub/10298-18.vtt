Hi, Peg.

01:22.501 --> 01:24.701
Gee, you must have
misunderstood me this morning.

01:24.701 --> 01:27.334
<i>I said you should buy
a vegetable.</i>

01:28.734 --> 01:31.467
Gee, and guess I must have
misunderstood you last night

01:31.467 --> 01:33.400
when you said: "Brace yourself.

01:33.400 --> 01:35.234
This time
it's gonna be good."

01:37.000 --> 01:38.100
Any mail?

01:38.100 --> 01:39.567
Oh, yeah.

01:39.567 --> 01:41.133
Something did come today.

01:41.133 --> 01:43.200
Let's see,
what did it say, uh...

01:43.200 --> 01:46.501
"Open immediately. Urgent.
Do not delay."

01:46.501 --> 01:48.334
Something like that.

01:48.334 --> 01:50.634
Gee, where could it be?

01:50.634 --> 01:52.434
Oh.

01:52.434 --> 01:53.434
Here it is.

01:55.167 --> 01:56.567
Oh, good.

01:58.801 --> 02:01.300
Those ashes from Sharper Image
I ordered came.

02:02.801 --> 02:04.567
Hey, this is from
Polk High School.

02:04.567 --> 02:07.334
What could they be writing to me
about after all these years?

02:07.334 --> 02:09.501
Well, maybe they've retired
your stall

02:09.501 --> 02:11.467
in the boy's bathroom.

02:15.300 --> 02:16.901

in sixth grade?

The one who took you
skinny dipping,

03:50.534 --> 03:53.834
stole your clothes, then ran
your underwear up a flagpole?

03:53.834 --> 03:55.367
Yup.

03:55.367 --> 03:57.801
Bud, why don't you just go out
with somebody who likes you?

03:57.801 --> 03:59.267

As it happens, Heather's
quite taken with me.

as Heather McCoy

How did you do that?

04:42.801 --> 04:44.767
Research.

04:44.767 --> 04:47.801

since the sixth grade...

04:47.801 --> 04:49.634
plotting, planning,

04:49.634 --> 04:52.200
cataloging her likes
and dislikes.

that was five years ago.

05:17.367 --> 05:19.567
Nobody remembers your underwear
up on a flagpole.

05:19.567 --> 05:22.534
I pledge allegiance

05:22.534 --> 05:24.534
to the underwear of

05:24.534 --> 05:28.167
the united shorts
of Bud Bundy.

who do that to me every day.

get Heather McCoy.

is now completed.

05:41.934 --> 05:43.234
What's phase two,

05:43.234 --> 05:46.767

and then start to cry?

06:03.100 --> 06:05.868

that is I.

06:05.868 --> 06:09.100
And then, at 10 o'clock sharp,

06:09.100 --> 06:11.067
I dance her over
to the big floor vent,

06:11.067 --> 06:13.734
which, by Friday,
will be set on a timer.

06:13.734 --> 06:15.367
And at precisely 10:00,

06:15.367 --> 06:17.767

whooshes through the vent

06:17.767 --> 06:19.734
like dad on a bologna bender,

06:19.734 --> 06:22.901

will see her underwear!

06:54.868 --> 06:58.334
Maybe I ought to take a picture
of your behind.

if the couch was ever stolen,

you to do

07:28.501 --> 07:30.667
is to announce
this year's M.V.P.

and then slink off into
the shadows of obscurity

07:33.200 --> 07:35.400

more than just a shoe salesman,

football helmet?

of your head,

grew over it.

get down on my knees

08:13.334 --> 08:15.534

do something to you,

actually ruined your whole life?

Yes, and you call
that girl "Mom," now.

Well, what if she didn't
actually marry me

09:01.467 --> 09:03.133

real bad?

get revenge

who's wronged you,

09:36.334 --> 09:37.834
do it.

09:37.834 --> 09:40.601
Do it now, do it good,
do it twice.

09:43.267 --> 09:45.801

in your life, son,

09:45.801 --> 09:47.901

you got revenge on

09:47.901 --> 09:50.901

of them all.
