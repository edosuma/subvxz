<i>- Hey, Gypsy, this is Stan.
- Hi, Gypsy.</i>

00:35.619 --> 00:37.472
<i>- I'll let you guys talk.
- Hi, I'm Det. Hancock.</i>

00:37.496 --> 00:39.246
<i>I'm with Greene County Sheriff's Office.</i>

00:39.290 --> 00:40.910
<i>- How are you today?
- I'm doing good.</i>

00:40.958 --> 00:41.958
<i>Good.</i>

00:44.795 --> 00:46.245
<i>You need to be honest with me.</i>

00:46.297 --> 00:48.547
<i>And if you're involved in anything</i>

00:48.591 --> 00:50.902
<i>that I'm about ready to tell you,
then you need to tell me, okay?</i>

00:50.926 --> 00:54.216
<i>- Absolutely.
- Um, your mom's dead, okay?</i>

00:54.263 --> 00:56.103
<i>Now, what I want to ask you...</i>

00:56.140 --> 00:59.350
<i>- Wait, what, what?
- Your mom's passed away, okay?</i>

00:59.393 --> 01:01.233
<i>She's deceased, all right?</i>

01:01.270 --> 01:02.940
<i>Now, what I want to ask you...</i>

01:02.980 --> 01:05.230
<i>Did you have involvement in this?</i>

01:05.274 --> 01:08.574
<i>- Okay.
- No, no...</i>

01:08.611 --> 01:10.901
<i>Hang on, listen to me for
just a second, okay?</i>

01:10.946 --> 01:13.486
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>
- <i>What happened</i> with your mom that night?

01:14.867 --> 01:17.027
<i>Um...</i>

01:17.077 --> 01:19.447
<i>I don't know what happened
with my mom at all.</i>

01:19.497 --> 01:20.974
<i>- Help me. Please help me.
- Okay, you...</i>

01:20.998 --> 01:22.918
<i>Just listen to me, okay, sweetheart?</i>

01:22.958 --> 01:25.248
<i>You know what happened to your mom, okay?</i>

01:25.294 --> 01:27.754
<i>And I know that you know.</i>

01:27.797 --> 01:29.627
<i>You think that it's me?</i>

01:29.673 --> 01:31.473
<i>Why would you think that it's me?</i>

01:31.509 --> 01:33.219
<i>I have always loved my mom.</i>

01:33.260 --> 01:34.640
<i>My mom and I are best friends.</i>

01:34.678 --> 01:36.218
<i>Listen to me.</i>

01:36.263 --> 01:37.824
<i>Please don't dig yourself in this hole,</i>

01:37.848 --> 01:39.558
<i>and that's what you're doing.</i>

01:41.310 --> 01:43.310
<i>I really love my mom.</i>

01:43.354 --> 01:44.904
- I know you do.
- Please.

01:44.939 --> 01:47.689
<i>I know you... sweetheart,
I know you love your mom.</i>

01:47.733 --> 01:49.733
<i>I have no doubt that you love your mom.</i>

01:56.033 --> 01:58.123
<i>Now's the time to be truthful, sweetheart.</i>

01:58.160 --> 02:00.740
<i>No more lies.</i>

02:00.788 --> 02:04.038
<i>- Did you kill your mom?
- No. No, sir.</i>

02:04.083 --> 02:06.753
<i>Did you help Nicholas kill your mom?</i>

02:14.635 --> 02:15.965
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

03:10.941 --> 03:12.441
<i>Breaking news this morning.</i>

03:12.484 --> 03:14.744
<i>48-year-old Dee Dee Blanchard</i>

03:14.778 --> 03:16.238
<i>was found dead inside her home.</i>

03:16.280 --> 03:18.240
<i>Her 19-year-old daughter Gypsy</i>

03:18.282 --> 03:21.242
<i>is still considered missing.</i>

03:21.285 --> 03:23.075
<i>It all started</i>

03:23.120 --> 03:25.370
<i>receiving a call on June 14th</i>

03:25.414 --> 03:28.044
to check the well-being of a family.

03:30.461 --> 03:32.211
<i>Gypsy and Dee Dee</i>

03:32.254 --> 03:35.424
<i>were Hurricane Katrina survivors.</i>

03:35.466 --> 03:38.376
<i>Everybody believed that
they were coming here</i>

03:38.427 --> 03:39.867
to the Ozarks to make a better life.

03:42.431 --> 03:43.721
<i>There was a Facebook post</i>

03:43.766 --> 03:46.386
<i>that was quite alarming.</i>

03:46.435 --> 03:49.895
<i>We were actually thinking that it was
somebody that hacked into the Facebook</i>

03:49.939 --> 03:52.149
<i>and it wasn't actually a threat.</i>

03:54.234 --> 03:56.944
<i>Gypsy was in a wheelchair.</i>

03:56.987 --> 04:00.258
She had leukemia and she
was having seizures

04:00.282 --> 04:02.822
and she had to be tube fed.

04:02.868 --> 04:05.158
<i>As the sheriff, my primary responsibility</i>

04:05.204 --> 04:07.294
<i>at that time was really to ensure</i>

04:07.331 --> 04:10.421
that her well-being was okay.

04:10.459 --> 04:14.459
Whatever they were going through
was incredibly hard for them,

04:14.505 --> 04:16.942
especially with the medical conditions.

04:16.966 --> 04:20.375
And so, everybody gathered around them

04:20.427 --> 04:23.547
<i>and would try to help them
out as much as possible.</i>

04:23.597 --> 04:26.137
<i>It just proves that happy endings</i>

04:26.183 --> 04:29.643
<i>are not just in fairy tales, they're real.</i>

04:33.482 --> 04:36.362
The Facebook post was quote...

04:38.112 --> 04:40.452
"The bitch is dead."

04:40.489 --> 04:43.119
And another post stating,

04:43.158 --> 04:44.948
"I fucking slashed that fat pig

04:44.994 --> 04:46.954
and raped her sweet, innocent daughter.

04:46.996 --> 04:50.536
Her scream was so fucking loud, LOL."

04:58.173 --> 05:00.923
Okay, good morning.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.798
I want to specify at the beginning
of this press conference

05:03.846 --> 05:07.846
that this is an ongoing investigation.

05:07.891 --> 05:11.311
And I want to start off with saying

05:11.353 --> 05:14.813
things are not always as they appear.

05:14.857 --> 05:17.085
<i>The truth is... okay, I'll admit it.</i>

05:17.109 --> 05:20.359
<i>I did actually...</i>

05:20.404 --> 05:21.704
<i>stab her.</i>

05:21.739 --> 05:23.949
<i>- I will admit it.
- I know, okay.</i>

05:23.991 --> 05:27.491
<i>The only reason I did it is
'cause I did it for me and her.</i>

05:27.536 --> 05:30.536
<i>- I would've never did it if it was not for me and her.
- Okay.</i>

05:30.581 --> 05:33.671
<i>I know that he loves me, and...</i>

05:33.709 --> 05:36.289
<i>he would do anything for me</i>

05:36.336 --> 05:38.296
<i>and... to be with me.</i>

05:38.338 --> 05:42.168
<i>Did Gypsy know that you were
going to kill her mother?</i>

05:42.217 --> 05:47.047
<i>Um... honestly,</i>

05:47.097 --> 05:48.847
<i>she asked me to.</i>

05:48.891 --> 05:49.971
<i>Okay.</i>

05:51.602 --> 05:53.352
<i>Both Facebook postings</i>

05:53.395 --> 05:56.185
<i>were authored by Gypsy.</i>

05:59.026 --> 06:01.526
<i>The prosecutor has filed
charges this morning</i>

06:01.570 --> 06:04.240
<i>for first-degree murder.</i>

06:04.281 --> 06:06.911
This is a tragic, tragic event

06:06.950 --> 06:12.910
surrounded by mystery and public deception.

06:12.956 --> 06:15.076
Gypsy can walk without assistance

06:15.125 --> 06:16.705
or a wheelchair...

06:18.420 --> 06:20.130
and she can do that very well.

06:27.179 --> 06:29.639
<i>Okay.</i>

06:44.279 --> 06:45.609
This individual has alleged

06:45.656 --> 06:48.116
to conspire with Nicholas Godejohn

06:48.158 --> 06:50.078
to stab her mother to death

06:50.119 --> 06:52.409
so that they could be together.

06:52.454 --> 06:55.834
The penalty is life imprisonment or death.

06:59.628 --> 07:02.248
<i>Seeing Gypsy Blanchard
walk on her own two feet</i>

07:02.297 --> 07:05.337
<i>in a Wisconsin courtroom was a
shock to friends and neighbors.</i>

07:05.384 --> 07:07.724
<i>Is she sick?</i>

07:07.761 --> 07:09.431
<i>I don't know yet.</i>

07:09.471 --> 07:10.801
<i>We're trying to figure that out.</i>

07:10.848 --> 07:11.808
<i>Can she walk?</i>

07:11.849 --> 07:15.139
<i>Um, yes.</i>

07:15.185 --> 07:17.345
<i>Oh, son of a bitch.</i>

07:18.647 --> 07:21.017
To see her walk...

07:22.776 --> 07:24.436
was really upsetting.

07:26.363 --> 07:28.033
<i>Obviously, if that's a lie,</i>

07:28.073 --> 07:30.783
then who knows what all was a lie.

07:30.826 --> 07:34.036
We really don't know the true
background of this family,

07:34.079 --> 07:35.499
as we have unearthed the appearance

07:35.539 --> 07:37.869
of a long financial fraud scheme.

07:37.916 --> 07:39.876
<i>The family got medical airlifts,</i>

07:39.918 --> 07:42.378
<i>Disney travel, and free
housing over the years</i>

07:42.421 --> 07:45.381
<i>because of Gypsy's supposed disabilities.</i>

07:45.424 --> 07:48.514
<i>It was a facade that translated online,</i>

07:48.552 --> 07:50.071
<i>donations pouring in</i>

07:50.095 --> 07:51.965
<i>for Gypsy's reported muscular dystrophy</i>

07:52.014 --> 07:53.934
<i>and leukemia.</i>

07:55.517 --> 07:59.387
<i>We have not confirmed the age of Gypsy.</i>

07:59.438 --> 08:01.558
It appears that there is
several date of births

08:01.607 --> 08:04.437
that have been used over a period of time.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.154
I almost want to say, "Man,
I can't believe she..."

08:07.196 --> 08:10.906
I even wanted to associate with...
why did I even help them?"

08:10.949 --> 08:13.279
<i>I just never would see
that that little girl</i>

08:13.327 --> 08:15.617
<i>really wasn't who she was supposed to be.</i>

08:33.513 --> 08:36.393
Case exhibit 53.

08:36.433 --> 08:39.023
Can I ask you if you'll
tell me what that is?

08:39.061 --> 08:40.561
<i>Miss Blanchard is charged</i>

08:40.604 --> 08:42.313
<i>with murder in the first degree.</i>

08:44.232 --> 08:45.793
When you commit a first-degree murder,

08:45.817 --> 08:48.027
you knowingly cause the
death of another person

08:48.070 --> 08:49.650
after deliberation.

08:49.696 --> 08:52.606
Analysis of cell phones

08:52.658 --> 08:55.448
provided evidence of numerous text messages

08:55.494 --> 08:58.124
between Gypsy Blanchard
and Nicholas Godejohn.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.536
<i>Nicholas Godejohn was someone</i>

09:01.583 --> 09:04.463
<i>that Gypsy Blanchard met online.</i>

09:04.503 --> 09:08.093
They began a online dating relationship.

09:08.131 --> 09:10.671
<i>During the attacks, the two discussed.</i>

09:10.717 --> 09:14.177
<i>Nicholas killing Clauddine.</i>

09:34.533 --> 09:36.413
At the beginning, it looks
like a tabloid case.

09:36.451 --> 09:39.451
It looks like, "Here's some
people in some weird outfits",

09:39.496 --> 09:42.706
and they're pretending to be disabled
and they're scamming everybody.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.644
And then there's this, like,
sort of horrible murder,

09:44.668 --> 09:46.980
and the Facebook status,
'That bitch is dead.'

09:47.004 --> 09:49.924
Like, all of it is very tabloid.

09:49.965 --> 09:53.375
And then, gradually, that story
just sort of fell apart.

09:55.846 --> 09:59.556
<i>Still, it feels to me like it's
developing into something else.</i>

10:17.909 --> 10:19.279
I still ask the question,

10:19.328 --> 10:21.118
"How do you kill your own mother?"

10:21.163 --> 10:22.623
I mean, there's got to be a reason.

10:22.664 --> 10:24.124
There's got to be some abuse there.

10:24.166 --> 10:26.206
You don't just... "I'm
gonna kill my mother

10:26.251 --> 10:28.001
because I wanna be with a boyfriend."

10:28.045 --> 10:29.745
Like I told my mom when I called my mom

10:29.796 --> 10:31.666
and talked to her about it.

10:31.715 --> 10:35.005
I said, "Mama, I've been... you
know, I was mad at you before,

10:35.052 --> 10:38.642
but I've never, ever in a million years

10:38.680 --> 10:40.760
thought about killing you."

10:40.807 --> 10:43.807
I said, "For me to think
about killing you,

10:43.852 --> 10:47.772
you'd have had to done some
pretty bad stuff to me."

10:47.814 --> 10:50.524
Nobody wants to believe that
something like this can happen.

10:52.069 --> 10:54.319
I think the initial reaction is...

10:54.363 --> 10:57.703
Is that, you know, Gypsy's
been lying to everybody.

10:57.741 --> 11:00.871
But when you look at the backstory,

11:00.911 --> 11:03.541
when you look at how we got here,

11:03.580 --> 11:05.620
this all started long before Gypsy

11:05.665 --> 11:10.165
would've ever had any type of
say in what was happening.

11:17.844 --> 11:20.304
Right from birth, three months old.

11:20.347 --> 11:24.807
Dee Dee was telling me
that she had sleep apnea

11:24.851 --> 11:27.641
and she needed a breathing machine

11:27.687 --> 11:30.727
or breathing monitor machine,

11:30.774 --> 11:33.274
which, I mean, I... to this day,

11:33.318 --> 11:35.778
I don't know if that was
real or not, you know?

11:35.821 --> 11:37.571
It escalated from then.

11:37.614 --> 11:41.204
<i>Problems with her eyes, her hearing,</i>

11:41.243 --> 11:42.953
<i>her digestive system.</i>

11:45.831 --> 11:48.211
After that, Gypsy couldn't walk anymore.

11:48.250 --> 11:51.500
She had a muscular disorder.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.718
<i>And Dee Dee told me she
would need a wheelchair.</i>

11:57.759 --> 12:00.389
You know, I asked her. I said,
"Man, she's got a lot of issues."

12:00.429 --> 12:03.429
"What's going on?" You know, and, um...

12:03.473 --> 12:06.193
They had done some tests and found
out she had a chromosome disorder

12:06.226 --> 12:10.306
that was causing all of her
functions from developing...

12:10.355 --> 12:12.555
Her digestive system and
her muscular system.

12:16.528 --> 12:18.698
Dee Dee told me she's not going to live

12:18.738 --> 12:21.568
to be, you know, 18 years old.

12:21.616 --> 12:25.366
She may be an old teenager,
that's about it.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.372
You know, I was like, "Really?"

12:27.414 --> 12:30.794
You know, it was shocking,
it was disturbing.

12:30.834 --> 12:33.254
And to see her at 23 years old now,

12:33.295 --> 12:36.165
perfectly healthy...

12:36.214 --> 12:39.554
It pisses me off, you know?

12:51.313 --> 12:53.613
This picture here...

12:53.648 --> 12:58.688
I don't know if this was the surgery

12:58.737 --> 13:01.107
where she thought her stomach lining

13:01.156 --> 13:02.946
wrapped around her esophagus.

13:02.991 --> 13:04.991
No, she would've had that earlier.

13:05.035 --> 13:08.405
She had that feeding tube way before then.

13:08.455 --> 13:09.865
You know?

13:09.915 --> 13:11.785
She was 10 here.

13:14.920 --> 13:17.840
<i>This was probably close
to the first year or two</i>

13:17.881 --> 13:20.381
<i>when she was in a wheelchair.</i>

13:20.425 --> 13:21.755
Yep.

13:23.094 --> 13:25.394
Breaks my heart...

13:25.430 --> 13:27.060
knowing she got put through all of this

13:27.098 --> 13:28.718
when she didn't need it.

13:31.019 --> 13:32.809
Fourteen years.

13:34.648 --> 13:36.608
To be confined.

13:37.734 --> 13:40.074
The last 14 years in a wheelchair.

13:40.111 --> 13:41.741
I couldn't imagine.

13:47.536 --> 13:50.196
<i>I've never encountered anything</i>

13:50.247 --> 13:53.287
<i>that is even close to what
Gypsy has gone through.</i>

13:55.502 --> 13:58.342
<i>Her mother appeared to
have taken great steps</i>

13:58.380 --> 14:02.340
<i>to keep Gypsy in a very juvenile role,</i>

14:02.384 --> 14:06.844
<i>making her act several years
younger than her actual age.</i>

14:08.640 --> 14:10.640
It appears that Gypsy was not even aware

14:10.684 --> 14:12.854
of what her actual age was.

14:14.646 --> 14:16.476
<i>I called her for her 18th birthday,</i>

14:16.523 --> 14:19.323
and Dee Dee said, "Don't tell
her she's 18, you know?"

14:19.359 --> 14:20.962
I'm like, "What you mean
don't tell her she's 18?

14:20.986 --> 14:23.276
She knows she's 18. It's
her 18th birthday."

14:23.321 --> 14:25.151
"Yeah, but she don't know she's 18.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.448
She's... you know..."

14:26.491 --> 14:28.031
I thought it was weird, you know?

14:28.076 --> 14:29.576
I... she...

14:29.619 --> 14:32.449
I mean, I always did know that she...

14:32.497 --> 14:34.617
She told me her mental capacity was,

14:34.666 --> 14:35.935
you know, like, five years behind.

14:35.959 --> 14:37.959
When she was, like, 15, she was like,

14:38.003 --> 14:40.303
"Oh, yeah, her learning is coming along,

14:40.338 --> 14:44.168
but she's like, mentally,
at a 9 or 10-year-old."

14:44.217 --> 14:47.637
She looks like she would be 10 and 11,

14:47.679 --> 14:51.179
and she was probably like, 21, 22.

14:52.434 --> 14:54.354
I wonder what she was thinking.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.440
<i>Hello, everybody! This is Gypsy Rose</i>

15:00.483 --> 15:02.653
<i>reporting from Aurora, Missouri.</i>

15:02.694 --> 15:05.364
<i>I'm about to dive off our porch</i>

15:05.405 --> 15:07.655
<i>into the pile of snow.</i>

15:07.699 --> 15:09.159
<i>You ready?</i>

15:12.704 --> 15:14.704
<i>That was so grand!</i>

15:14.748 --> 15:16.288
<i>Whoo!</i>

15:16.333 --> 15:17.923
<i>All right!</i>

15:17.959 --> 15:19.999
<i>Yooh!</i>

15:20.045 --> 15:21.285
<i>Yeah!</i>

15:24.007 --> 15:26.837
<i>That's so cool. Let's do it again.</i>

15:26.885 --> 15:28.375
<i>It's hard to answer a lot questions</i>

15:28.428 --> 15:30.048
about who Gypsy is, right?

15:30.096 --> 15:32.466
Because she was somebody
else for such a long time.

15:32.515 --> 15:34.675
<i>And now we know her</i>

15:34.726 --> 15:36.766
<i>as almost a completely different person.</i>

15:36.811 --> 15:40.441
- I'm Erin, as you remember.
- I remember.

15:40.482 --> 15:43.862
<i>I would be curious if
anybody Gypsy has talked to</i>

15:43.902 --> 15:46.692
<i>feels they're getting the full story.</i>

15:46.738 --> 15:51.068
This is actually kind of the
first time I've been honest

15:51.117 --> 15:54.407
besides being honest, you
know, with my attorneys.

15:54.454 --> 15:58.084
Even then, I haven't been
completely honest with them, so...

16:00.585 --> 16:02.665
How would you describe your mom?

16:02.712 --> 16:04.252
Um...

16:08.426 --> 16:10.216
unique.

16:10.261 --> 16:13.011
Um...

16:13.056 --> 16:14.386
I mean, I used to always think

16:14.432 --> 16:16.892
that maybe she was a little overprotective.

16:16.935 --> 16:20.225
So, if I had to say one word about her,

16:20.271 --> 16:23.231
it would be overprotective.

16:23.274 --> 16:24.404
<i>How old are you?</i>

16:25.735 --> 16:26.855
<i>You're one.</i>

16:26.903 --> 16:29.073
<i>And where's your cranial?</i>

16:29.114 --> 16:32.124
<i>Very good. And where's your phalanges?</i>

16:32.158 --> 16:35.578
<i>Yes. Very, very good.</i>

16:35.620 --> 16:40.540
I really didn't think
any abuse was going on.

16:40.583 --> 16:43.713
Um... it's like when you're abused,

16:43.753 --> 16:45.753
but you've lived that way your whole life.

16:45.797 --> 16:48.457
You don't really know
that you're being abused.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.878
You don't know any different.

16:50.927 --> 16:54.757
Looking at the open ocean now.

16:54.806 --> 16:57.006
And it's beautiful!

16:59.144 --> 17:01.064
<i>I knew that I was different</i>

17:01.104 --> 17:04.064
<i>or my life was different from other kids'.</i>

17:04.107 --> 17:07.607
<i>But people thought of us, as, you know,</i>

17:07.652 --> 17:11.742
the sweetest mother-daughter family ever.

17:11.781 --> 17:13.951
<i>The best two people in the world.</i>

17:16.453 --> 17:18.242
What illnesses did your mom

17:18.288 --> 17:20.748
say that you had?

17:20.790 --> 17:22.369
Um...

17:22.416 --> 17:26.877
asthma, epilepsy, hearing impaired,

17:26.921 --> 17:30.881
vision impaired, fed with a feeding tube,

17:30.925 --> 17:34.135
paralyzed from the waist down.

17:34.179 --> 17:35.679
Um...

17:35.722 --> 17:39.812
slow, so retardation.

17:39.851 --> 17:41.351
And... among other things,

17:41.394 --> 17:43.354
I just can't remember them.

17:58.828 --> 18:01.198
<i>I was on breathing medication.</i>

18:02.957 --> 18:05.077
<i>Medication for seizures.</i>

18:05.126 --> 18:08.496
<i>Medication to help go to the bathroom.</i>

18:08.546 --> 18:12.216
<i>Pain medication, anxiety medication.</i>

18:13.551 --> 18:16.221
Just everything.

18:16.262 --> 18:20.682
<i>I would have to put on the
breathing machine every night.</i>

18:20.725 --> 18:22.845
I hated it, though,
because it seemed to make

18:22.894 --> 18:24.694
my breathing worse, not better.

18:27.357 --> 18:31.147
<i>And then another machine
was for the feeding tube.</i>

18:31.194 --> 18:34.864
It was controlling what I'd eat.

18:34.906 --> 18:39.276
My medications would be put through there.

18:39.327 --> 18:41.447
<i>I really wouldn't even have to be awake.</i>

18:41.496 --> 18:44.286
<i>So, she could put whatever in my body,</i>

18:44.332 --> 18:46.042
<i>and I wouldn't even know.</i>

18:50.380 --> 18:51.840
<i>Hey, you make me wanna yawn.</i>

18:53.800 --> 18:56.840
<i>So, where are you going today?</i>

18:56.886 --> 19:00.346
I'm going to Children's Mercy Hospital

19:00.390 --> 19:03.270
to see my dentist.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.059
For my teeth.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.475
<i>And we'll be back.</i>

19:07.522 --> 19:09.982
And we'll be back soon.

19:10.024 --> 19:12.614
Not yet.

19:22.954 --> 19:24.874
<i>If we'd be going to the doctor,</i>

19:24.914 --> 19:27.254
<i>she would do all the talking.</i>

19:27.292 --> 19:29.082
<i>I'd always have a stuffed animal</i>

19:29.127 --> 19:31.997
<i>or a Barbie doll.</i>

19:32.046 --> 19:35.166
<i>She'd just tell me just
play with my Barbie doll.</i>

19:36.843 --> 19:39.473
<i>And if the doctor would
come to examine me...</i>

19:39.512 --> 19:41.302
"Just stay in the wheelchair,"

19:41.347 --> 19:43.927
be calm, play with your doll,

19:43.975 --> 19:45.885
<i>and don't move your legs."</i>

19:57.030 --> 19:59.950
<i>I was just as much in the
dark as everybody else.</i>

19:59.991 --> 20:02.491
<i>The only thing I knew is that I could walk.</i>

20:02.535 --> 20:04.035
<i>As for everything else,</i>

20:04.078 --> 20:06.998
you had the leukemia and the epilepsy.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.370
I was taking medication

20:08.416 --> 20:10.496
that she said was cancer medicine.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.293
<i>She would shave my head and say,</i>

20:12.337 --> 20:13.957
<i>"Well, it's going to fall out anyway,</i>

20:14.005 --> 20:17.255
<i>so let's just keep it nice and neat."</i>

20:17.300 --> 20:21.390
I just went on blind faith
that a mother knows best.

20:30.396 --> 20:35.226
You're supposed to love and
protect your children.

20:35.276 --> 20:37.436
How could you do this to your child?

20:37.487 --> 20:40.657
<i>Gypsy Rose Blanchard</i>

20:40.698 --> 20:42.778
was as consistently.

20:42.825 --> 20:46.405
And viciously subjected to,

20:46.454 --> 20:48.599
in my opinion, Munchausen by proxy

20:48.623 --> 20:50.623
as anyone I've come across.

20:50.667 --> 20:53.547
<i>Munchausen by proxy involves a caregiver</i>

20:53.586 --> 20:59.216
<i>who either feigns or actually
induces illness in her children.</i>

20:59.258 --> 21:03.008
And her goal is some kind of
emotional gratification...

21:03.054 --> 21:07.354
<i>Looking for sympathy, attention, care,</i>

21:07.392 --> 21:11.272
<i>concern that she feels unable
to get in any other way.</i>

21:11.312 --> 21:15.862
<i>It is a form of child
abuse, first and foremost.</i>

21:15.900 --> 21:18.030
<i>The earliest surgery that I can remember</i>

21:18.069 --> 21:20.699
<i>probably would be</i>

21:20.738 --> 21:23.858
<i>having my feeding tube put in.</i>

21:25.535 --> 21:27.695
<i>You have to have it constantly changed,</i>

21:27.745 --> 21:29.535
<i>like every six months.</i>

21:29.580 --> 21:31.080
And that would be pretty painful,

21:31.124 --> 21:33.214
because they don't put
you under anesthesia,

21:33.251 --> 21:35.541
they just take you in the emergency room,

21:35.586 --> 21:38.206
rip the old one out, and put a new one in.

21:38.256 --> 21:41.876
I don't know why these procedures were done

21:41.926 --> 21:46.256
or how her mother was able
to convince the doctors.

21:46.305 --> 21:47.805
"Mindboggling" is the only way

21:47.849 --> 21:52.269
I can put her ability to manipulate people.

22:02.864 --> 22:05.494
Basically, each one of these paperclips

22:05.533 --> 22:09.793
is some medical record

22:09.829 --> 22:13.159
where Dee Dee essentially lied

22:13.207 --> 22:15.117
to the doctor about something.

22:15.168 --> 22:17.038
Mentally, Gypsy is behind.

22:17.086 --> 22:18.522
She's at the level of a seven-year-old

22:18.546 --> 22:20.206
on mother's information.

22:20.256 --> 22:22.206
And this is something that you see

22:22.258 --> 22:24.718
almost across all of the records,

22:24.761 --> 22:29.261
is "Upon mother's information,"
"Upon history by mother."

22:29.307 --> 22:32.217
So she's talking to the doctor
here and she's talking about

22:32.268 --> 22:35.978
how she has mental and developmental
delays, needs assistance.

22:36.022 --> 22:39.232
Apparently, "while holding her
hands over Gypsy's ears,

22:39.275 --> 22:42.355
so as not offend, history
of mental retardation...

22:42.403 --> 22:44.573
seven-year-old level, per mom."

22:44.614 --> 22:49.454
And so, this was the one time where
a doctor actually put in the record

22:49.494 --> 22:52.664
that Dee Dee's got her
hands over Gypsy's ears,

22:52.705 --> 22:56.285
so Gypsy can't even hear what
Mom is telling the doctor.

22:56.334 --> 22:58.294
Then we get into the family history.

22:58.336 --> 23:00.126
The family history changed

23:00.171 --> 23:03.011
depending on what doctor she was at.

23:03.049 --> 23:06.049
You'll notice here, we don't
get a whole lot of...

23:06.094 --> 23:08.447
- She's at the cardiologist.
- Right, she's at the cardiologist,

23:08.471 --> 23:10.601
and so they all died of a heart attack.

23:12.058 --> 23:14.978
Now, this was the first one
that jumped out at me.

23:16.854 --> 23:18.854
<i>She ends up going to the neurologist,</i>

23:18.898 --> 23:22.188
<i>Dr. Flasterstein, and so...</i>

23:22.235 --> 23:25.945
the very first thing right off the bat...
"Mother is not a good historian,"

23:25.988 --> 23:30.908
<i>which is interesting, because he
puts that in bold and underlines it.</i>

23:30.952 --> 23:33.372
<i>One of the things that
was a big discrepancy</i>

23:33.412 --> 23:36.372
was that for a person that has not walked

23:36.415 --> 23:38.865
for nine years, for years,

23:38.918 --> 23:41.168
she should have, technically,

23:41.212 --> 23:44.462
almost no muscles in her lower extremities.

23:44.507 --> 23:49.007
<i>But she did have muscles
that looked quite normal.</i>

23:49.053 --> 23:51.603
<i>And she was able to
support her body weight.</i>

23:51.639 --> 23:54.099
<i>I remember her standing.</i>

23:54.142 --> 23:57.312
So, I had a big doubt about the
whole thing, from the beginning.

23:57.353 --> 24:00.403
<i>He says, "Since last seen,</i>

24:00.439 --> 24:03.519
<i>I managed to talk to one
of her previous providers.</i>

24:03.568 --> 24:07.318
<i>She specifically remembers Gypsy Rose and
mentioned that her previous neurologist</i>

24:07.363 --> 24:12.243
<i>clearly reported the fact that Gypsy
does not have muscular dystrophy.</i>

24:12.285 --> 24:15.325
Analyzing all the facts, and after
talking to her previous pediatrician,

24:15.371 --> 24:18.621
- there's a strong possibility of Munchausen by proxy...
- What?

24:18.666 --> 24:22.626
...with maybe some underlying, unknown
ideology to explain her symptoms."

24:28.092 --> 24:32.552
Once in a while, we report
patients to Social Services.

24:32.597 --> 24:36.267
We do that when we feel
that there's a neglect.

24:36.309 --> 24:39.389
But a neglect is different
from what this mom was doing.

24:39.437 --> 24:41.147
She wasn't really neglecting her,

24:41.189 --> 24:44.229
she was overtreating her.

24:44.275 --> 24:46.395
<i>We have a system,</i>

24:46.444 --> 24:48.404
<i>which is a big integrated system,</i>

24:48.446 --> 24:52.196
<i>that decided to adopt her
and bring her, support her.</i>

24:52.241 --> 24:55.121
<i>So many people looking at her,</i>

24:55.161 --> 24:58.201
knowing the history, knowing
what she was going through,

24:58.247 --> 25:00.537
knowing what she went through,

25:00.583 --> 25:03.043
I would have been rejected on the spot.

25:03.085 --> 25:05.535
So all that I could do was
put that in my notes.

25:05.588 --> 25:08.708
<i>Nobody in the system ever
said anything about it,</i>

25:08.758 --> 25:11.378
and I didn't see it right to keep going

25:11.427 --> 25:16.007
in convincing other people that
something is not right here.

25:16.057 --> 25:18.307
- Now...
- Un-freakin'-believable.

25:18.351 --> 25:21.191
...here's the interesting thing.

25:21.229 --> 25:23.809
This is the last record

25:23.856 --> 25:27.396
from Mercy, here in
Springfield, until 2015.

25:27.443 --> 25:28.943
So, this is 2007.

25:28.986 --> 25:30.816
Eight years.

25:30.863 --> 25:35.243
What I couldn't figure out
was how Dee Dee figured out

25:35.284 --> 25:37.954
that Dr. Flasterstein was on to her.

25:37.995 --> 25:40.495
But if you look at a lot
these social work notes,

25:40.539 --> 25:44.169
Dee Dee's requesting medical records.

25:44.210 --> 25:46.710
She would have gotten a
copy of this letter.

25:46.754 --> 25:50.134
But I still don't understand

25:50.174 --> 25:54.684
why you put your child through this.

25:56.097 --> 25:58.887
I don't know. I mean, the thing is...

25:58.933 --> 26:01.603
- Good question.
- ...It just keeps going.

26:01.644 --> 26:03.484
And it would have kept going

26:03.521 --> 26:10.231
'cause her mama was an
insane, compulsive liar.

26:19.662 --> 26:23.462
<i>Dee Dee and I met at the
bowling alley one night.</i>

26:23.499 --> 26:26.129
<i>Met up again a couple of weeks later.</i>

26:26.168 --> 26:29.798
<i>And then we started dating then.</i>

26:29.839 --> 26:30.919
She got pregnant.

26:30.965 --> 26:33.795
She got pregnant and...

26:33.843 --> 26:36.683
being from the South, I guess, it was...

26:36.721 --> 26:39.391
I was raised where you got a girl pregnant,

26:39.432 --> 26:41.022
then you got married.

26:41.058 --> 26:43.388
There was no other question
about what you did.

26:45.396 --> 26:47.016
<i>I was 17.</i>

26:49.025 --> 26:50.815
<i>I woke up on my 18th birthday</i>

26:50.860 --> 26:53.400
and I'm like, "What am I doing here?"

26:55.656 --> 26:57.236
<i>She was kind of into some dark...</i>

26:57.283 --> 26:58.953
<i>Darkness... dark things.</i>

26:58.993 --> 27:00.873
Uh...

27:00.911 --> 27:02.848
she started talking a little
bit about witchcrafts

27:02.872 --> 27:07.582
and just different weird,
dark stuff like that.

27:07.626 --> 27:09.536
It was kind of weird.

27:09.587 --> 27:11.207
She had a pet tarantula.

27:19.263 --> 27:20.643
Dee Dee was my aunt.

27:20.681 --> 27:25.851
Um, real... weird girl.

27:25.895 --> 27:29.185
I would think she's bipolar, no doubt.

27:29.231 --> 27:31.771
Multiple personalities, perhaps.

27:33.819 --> 27:36.069
Definitely...

27:36.113 --> 27:39.113
an evil person, I would say, you know?

27:44.914 --> 27:48.924
To shave your kid's head and
say that she's got leukemia?

27:48.959 --> 27:50.959
You're a sick individual.

27:54.507 --> 27:56.877
<i>At this time, we'd like to present to you.</i>

27:56.926 --> 27:59.836
<i>South Lafourche ROTC Military Queen,</i>

27:59.887 --> 28:01.887
<i>Ms. Clauddinea Pitre.</i>

28:01.931 --> 28:05.681
<i>Her escort... Sergeant Earl Longden.</i>

28:08.562 --> 28:10.312
<i>Clauddine "Dee Dee" Pitre...</i>

28:24.662 --> 28:27.292
What was Dee Dee like as a child?

28:27.331 --> 28:28.751
What, baby?

28:28.791 --> 28:30.961
What was Dee Dee like as a child?

28:31.001 --> 28:34.461
- What was Dee Dee like as a child?
- Dee Dee?

28:34.505 --> 28:36.375
She was okay.

28:36.424 --> 28:38.674
We were pretty close, me and her.

28:38.717 --> 28:42.337
Yeah, I would give her everything
that she wanted anyway.

28:42.388 --> 28:44.508
Whatever she wanted.

28:44.557 --> 28:47.137
Except a dog in the house.
I didn't want that.

28:47.184 --> 28:49.144
Now we wind up... we got
two dogs in the house.

28:52.815 --> 28:56.015
Ahem, but this... She was something else.

28:59.363 --> 29:02.873
<i>She was a very filthy person.</i>

29:02.908 --> 29:04.868
If it didn't go her way,

29:04.910 --> 29:06.830
she'd see to it that you would pay.

29:06.871 --> 29:09.501
And did we pay.

29:09.540 --> 29:11.620
Paid a lot.

29:11.667 --> 29:13.627
She opened credit cards in my dad's name,

29:13.669 --> 29:17.049
my grandpa's name, ran up crazy bills.

29:17.089 --> 29:20.049
Supposedly, America's Most Wanted
was looking for this girl.

29:29.268 --> 29:30.978
Slidell... she was wanted.

29:31.020 --> 29:32.730
Bad checks in New Orleans.

29:34.148 --> 29:35.648
<i>No matter where she went,</i>

29:35.691 --> 29:38.071
<i>she was doing all kind of stuff.</i>

29:38.110 --> 29:40.650
She was poisoning my stepmother.

29:40.696 --> 29:43.986
Supposedly, she was giving her some...

29:44.033 --> 29:47.333
Roundup in her food and stuff.

29:47.369 --> 29:50.159
She was putting some poison in my food.

29:50.206 --> 29:52.456
The same thing she had put in the plant.

29:52.500 --> 29:55.750
And she wind up... she stayed
nine months in bed after that.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.174
She couldn't get up.

29:57.213 --> 29:59.213
I didn't think she was going to make it.

29:59.256 --> 30:01.416
There was nothing she
couldn't get away with.

30:06.263 --> 30:08.643
<i>Her mama was a little bit like her.</i>

30:08.682 --> 30:11.392
<i>Yeah, her mama, too.</i>

30:11.435 --> 30:16.765
<i>Her mama was a shoplifter
and all kind of stuff.</i>

30:16.815 --> 30:19.185
I don't know how many times
she had to go to court

30:19.235 --> 30:20.815
for shoplifting and other things.

30:25.241 --> 30:27.911
She had stolen how much
money from your daddy?

30:27.952 --> 30:30.912
Before he got married, she had stolen

30:30.955 --> 30:33.745
I think it's $3,000 or
$4,000 from my daddy.

30:36.168 --> 30:38.588
<i>I think ever since my grandmother died,</i>

30:38.629 --> 30:40.999
<i>Dee Dee kind of went off the deep end.</i>

30:42.883 --> 30:44.553
The day that her mom died,

30:44.593 --> 30:46.513
Dee Dee was in the house somewhere,

30:46.554 --> 30:49.854
and Dee Dee was starving her.

30:49.890 --> 30:53.140
Like, she wasn't... Dee Dee wasn't
giving her anything to eat.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.020
I asked her sister...

30:56.063 --> 30:57.624
You know, I was like, "I hate to ask this,

30:57.648 --> 31:00.318
but you think Dee Dee had anything to do

31:00.359 --> 31:02.729
with her mom's death?"

31:02.778 --> 31:05.948
And she, you know, said,

31:05.990 --> 31:07.660
"Now I wonder."

31:09.743 --> 31:11.873
<i>That's how evil she was.</i>

31:14.665 --> 31:17.245
To leave your mama dirty
and asking for food

31:17.293 --> 31:19.003
and not want to feed her...

31:19.044 --> 31:21.634
- Yeah.
- ...That's evil.

31:24.341 --> 31:27.131
Were you sad at all when
you heard she was dead?

31:29.138 --> 31:31.008
Me?

31:31.056 --> 31:34.056
I didn't believe it.

31:34.101 --> 31:36.731
- It didn't...
- It just didn't sink.

31:36.770 --> 31:39.770
It took a few days before... you know?

31:39.815 --> 31:42.935
I didn't believe that she was dead.

31:42.985 --> 31:46.775
I thought it was another one of her tricks.

31:46.822 --> 31:49.202
I said, "Who did Dee Dee piss off now?"

31:49.241 --> 31:52.241
You know, what kind of shit
did Dee Dee get into?"

31:52.286 --> 31:54.576
I wasn't thinking, "Oh,
God, my aunt's dead."

31:54.622 --> 31:56.962
Because I figured that one
day she'd piss off somebody

31:56.999 --> 31:59.039
to that point, you know?

31:59.084 --> 32:02.504
And I actually did think that it
would probably be Gypsy, you know?

32:02.546 --> 32:06.506
And whenever... We later got the word

32:06.550 --> 32:09.090
that Gypsy was fine and she
was by her boyfriend's house,

32:09.136 --> 32:11.114
we were like, "She killed her mama.
She finally did it.

32:11.138 --> 32:12.428
She couldn't take it anymore.

32:12.473 --> 32:13.867
She finally just said, "Fuck it all."

32:13.891 --> 32:15.641
I'm killing this bitch."

32:15.684 --> 32:19.104
Do you think she got what she deserved?

32:19.146 --> 32:21.766
- According to Gypsy, yes.
- Yes.

32:21.815 --> 32:24.855
Yeah, she got what she deserved.

32:24.902 --> 32:28.242
I know all the brothers
and sisters don't care

32:28.280 --> 32:30.450
about Dee Dee no more.

32:30.491 --> 32:33.371
Gypsy... she got cremated.

32:33.410 --> 32:35.450
She said, "What you want
me to do with the ashes?"

32:35.496 --> 32:37.696
Everybody said, "I don't want her.
I don't want her."

32:37.748 --> 32:40.918
- Darla said, "Flush 'em."
- I told her, "Flush that in the toilet."

32:40.959 --> 32:43.379
I didn't want it.

32:43.420 --> 32:45.920
Her sister said, "Flush
that in the toilet."

32:45.964 --> 32:48.026
She said, "We're going to
bring that in Mama's room,

32:48.050 --> 32:49.590
make her a mass and everything."

32:49.635 --> 32:52.215
"You going to pay for it?
I'm not paying for it.

32:52.262 --> 32:55.432
We can't afford it. Flush
it in the toilet."

33:16.870 --> 33:19.790
<i>Prosecutors have decided not
to seek the death penalty</i>

33:19.832 --> 33:22.002
<i>against a Springfield
woman and her boyfriend,</i>

33:22.042 --> 33:25.462
<i>both of whom are accused of
murdering the woman's mother.</i>

33:25.504 --> 33:27.884
<i>The announcement comes after
several conversations</i>

33:27.923 --> 33:29.803
<i>between the defense and prosecution,</i>

33:29.842 --> 33:32.472
<i>both agreeing this was the best decision.</i>

33:33.929 --> 33:35.719
<i>Being a prosecutor,</i>

33:35.764 --> 33:37.814
<i>the standard is to do what's right</i>

33:37.850 --> 33:39.140
<i>and what's just.</i>

33:40.436 --> 33:42.436
When you look at the mitigators

33:42.479 --> 33:45.229
as well as the background of
these individuals as we know it,

33:45.274 --> 33:47.114
as well as the facts of the case,

33:47.151 --> 33:50.071
this case was not an appropriate
first-degree murder case

33:50.112 --> 33:51.822
in which to seek the death penalty.

33:51.864 --> 33:55.664
This is a case that we haven't dealt with,

33:55.701 --> 33:58.831
and it's because it's so unusual.

33:58.871 --> 34:00.951
I mean, it really is an unusual case.

34:02.541 --> 34:05.041
<i>What we thought initially may be a victim</i>

34:05.085 --> 34:06.745
<i>turns out to be a suspect,</i>

34:06.795 --> 34:10.045
<i>and in the middle of a
story that is twisted.</i>

34:10.090 --> 34:12.920
<i>We think we know who Gypsy is,</i>

34:12.967 --> 34:15.888
<i>but once this trial starts,</i>

34:15.929 --> 34:17.849
we'll be able to see her life unfold

34:17.889 --> 34:22.100
and find out exactly
what she was all about.

34:26.523 --> 34:27.773
<i>Hi, everybody.</i>

34:27.815 --> 34:30.476
<i>Right now, I'm in Cinderella's castle</i>

34:30.527 --> 34:33.987
<i>eating some real mashed potatoes.</i>

34:34.031 --> 34:35.860
<i>Mm!</i>

34:35.908 --> 34:37.318
<i>That is good.</i>

34:42.915 --> 34:44.915
<i>Gypsy loved Disney</i>

34:44.958 --> 34:47.748
<i>because they were stories that resolved</i>

34:47.795 --> 34:49.625
<i>in happy ways.</i>

34:49.670 --> 34:53.221
And ultimately, her story was
not resolving in a happy way.

34:55.092 --> 34:58.513
<i>I liked the Disney movie "Tangled."</i>

34:59.765 --> 35:01.215
It's about Rapunzel.

35:02.726 --> 35:05.096
<i>She's a princess in this kingdom</i>

35:05.145 --> 35:09.555
and she's kidnapped by Mother Gothel

35:09.608 --> 35:10.898
<i>from her real family.</i>

35:12.444 --> 35:14.994
<i>And Mother Gothel keeps her</i>

35:15.030 --> 35:17.740
<i>in this tower for all of her life</i>

35:17.783 --> 35:20.163
<i>and tells her, "Don't leave this tower."</i>

35:20.202 --> 35:24.082
And so, that is all she knows.

35:24.122 --> 35:26.212
<i>I think that Gypsy just wanted her life</i>

35:26.250 --> 35:29.170
<i>to be like any fairy tale princess</i>

35:29.211 --> 35:32.501
<i>and have the perfect ending.</i>

35:32.548 --> 35:35.418
You know, all the bad villains
get what they deserve.

35:37.219 --> 35:40.179
<i>At the end, Mother Gothel died.</i>

35:40.222 --> 35:42.432
<i>She got thrown out a window,</i>

35:42.474 --> 35:47.064
um, because Rapunzel tried
to stand up for herself

35:47.104 --> 35:49.194
and leave her tower.

35:49.231 --> 35:51.691
But in Disney movies,
everything's a fantasy.

35:51.733 --> 35:53.193
It's a fairy tale,

35:53.235 --> 35:55.855
and life is not a fairy tale.

35:55.904 --> 35:58.454
I learned all that the hard way.

36:01.368 --> 36:03.304
<i>I don't think calling
Gypsy's life sheltered</i>

36:03.328 --> 36:05.538
<i>would do it justice.</i>

36:05.581 --> 36:07.871
I've kind of come to describe it

36:07.916 --> 36:09.956
as a fairy tale nightmare.

36:12.004 --> 36:15.514
<i>Her mother controlled almost
every aspect of her life.</i>

36:16.967 --> 36:19.177
<i>The control was total</i>

36:19.219 --> 36:22.759
in the same sense that the
control of a kidnapped victim

36:22.806 --> 36:26.266
sometimes is total.

36:26.310 --> 36:28.850
<i>Her daughter was, in essence, a hostage,</i>

36:28.896 --> 36:31.686
<i>and I think we can understand the crime</i>

36:31.732 --> 36:33.612
<i>that occurred subsequently</i>

36:33.650 --> 36:38.030
in terms of a hostage
trying to gain escape.

36:41.033 --> 36:42.873
<i>Any time Gypsy and I were together,</i>

36:42.910 --> 36:45.580
<i>her mom was always present.</i>

36:45.621 --> 36:48.121
She was immediately like a
filter for us, you know.

36:48.165 --> 36:51.205
Like, Gypsy wouldn't talk
about anything personal

36:51.251 --> 36:52.581
while we were together.

36:52.628 --> 36:55.208
That's like, really, the big red flag,

36:55.255 --> 36:57.295
thinking back on it all now.

36:58.842 --> 37:02.262
Dee Dee would always hold
Gypsy's hand, you know?

37:02.304 --> 37:04.974
It was like, I don't know... it
was almost like, you know, just,

37:05.015 --> 37:07.135
"If I squeeze it, you'll know what to say."

37:07.184 --> 37:09.354
I mean, that was just so strange to me.

37:09.394 --> 37:12.104
Just to feel it now, I think
that was really strange.

37:12.147 --> 37:14.307
<i>Even in videos I've seen since then,</i>

37:14.358 --> 37:15.835
<i>I'm like, "Yep, it's just the same thing."</i>

37:15.859 --> 37:18.029
<i>It's like she's holding her hand.</i>

37:21.365 --> 37:25.275
I mean, now I'm... It was
maybe a control thing.

37:25.327 --> 37:29.157
<i>The hand-holding and the tight hugs</i>

37:29.206 --> 37:31.956
<i>is a way of asserting
mastery over another person</i>

37:32.000 --> 37:34.630
and saying, "You're not free."

37:34.670 --> 37:37.250
You are under my control at all times,

37:37.297 --> 37:39.967
even in relatively benign situations

37:40.008 --> 37:41.878
<i>like our being photographed</i>

37:41.927 --> 37:44.177
<i>getting the Habitat for Humanity home.</i>

37:44.221 --> 37:47.061
<i>You know, those are
innocuously happy occasions,</i>

37:47.099 --> 37:49.389
but they were also occasions where Dee Dee

37:49.434 --> 37:52.734
reasserted her mastery over Gypsy.

37:52.771 --> 37:54.481
<i>My mom had cake...</i>

37:54.523 --> 37:57.193
<i>If we were in a group of friends,</i>

37:57.234 --> 37:59.379
you know, if I said something
that I wasn't supposed to,

37:59.403 --> 38:02.613
she'd squeeze my hand,
and I'd know, "Zip it."

38:06.535 --> 38:09.035
<i>I was just afraid, just too afraid.</i>

38:11.665 --> 38:13.705
<i>I have a strong feeling</i>

38:13.750 --> 38:16.880
<i>that the extent of the control over her,</i>

38:16.920 --> 38:19.380
<i>heavily psychological as it was,</i>

38:19.423 --> 38:22.133
would've involved physical
punishment as well.

38:22.175 --> 38:24.085
She'd hit me with a coat hanger...

38:25.804 --> 38:27.764
or her... or her palm.

38:29.474 --> 38:31.434
And I'd have to take so many slaps

38:31.476 --> 38:33.806
for... depending on what,

38:33.854 --> 38:36.524
how severe it was, I did.

38:36.565 --> 38:39.315
- Did you ever try to hit back?
- Never.

38:39.359 --> 38:41.319
Never.

38:41.361 --> 38:43.151
It's like if you have a baby

38:43.196 --> 38:44.776
and you, like, get in its face

38:44.823 --> 38:47.453
and the baby starts to struggle
and get away from you.

38:47.492 --> 38:50.582
Now picture that happening
for your whole life, right?

38:50.620 --> 38:54.750
Your mother is just in your
face and will not get away.

38:54.791 --> 38:58.291
That's basically what Gypsy's
whole life was like.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.046
<i>It's snowing.</i>

39:00.088 --> 39:02.168
<i>I'm not joking.</i>

39:02.215 --> 39:04.045
<i>They said it's snowing,</i>

39:04.092 --> 39:07.802
<i>so I'm staying under my heating blankie.</i>

39:07.846 --> 39:12.266
<i>And I'm not getting out, mm-mm.</i>

39:13.477 --> 39:15.637
<i>She wants to get out.</i>

39:15.687 --> 39:18.057
<i>Ain't gonna happen.</i>

39:18.106 --> 39:20.476
<i>Let her doll take care of her.</i>

39:20.525 --> 39:22.315
<i>Oh!</i>

39:31.078 --> 39:33.408
Her mother was so suffocating,

39:33.455 --> 39:37.285
so powerful, so manipulative

39:37.334 --> 39:41.174
<i>that Gypsy may have felt
any efforts to escape</i>

39:41.213 --> 39:42.553
<i>were bound to fail.</i>

39:43.965 --> 39:46.125
The first time I ran away from home,

39:46.176 --> 39:48.506
I had met a friend.

39:48.553 --> 39:52.683
<i>We both went to this sci-fi fantasy
convention called Visioncon.</i>

39:53.975 --> 39:56.725
I told him vaguely

39:56.770 --> 39:59.310
about what was going on at home.

39:59.356 --> 40:03.266
And he told me, you know,
"You just pack your stuff

40:03.318 --> 40:07.238
and you can come live
with me in Arkansas."

40:07.280 --> 40:10.030
And I said, "Okay."

40:12.744 --> 40:16.124
<i>I stepped out, got a ride from a stranger,</i>

40:16.164 --> 40:18.334
<i>and went over to his place.</i>

40:18.375 --> 40:21.995
And then within, like, four hours,
my mom found me at his place

40:22.045 --> 40:24.495
because we had mutual friends in common.

40:24.548 --> 40:27.668
So she was threatening
to call the cops on him.

40:27.717 --> 40:29.587
And she took me back home

40:29.636 --> 40:32.006
and smashed my computer with a hammer,

40:32.055 --> 40:33.825
smashed my cell phone
with a hammer and said,

40:33.849 --> 40:36.059
"If you ever try to do that again,

40:36.101 --> 40:38.231
I'm going to smash your
fingers with a hammer."

40:39.271 --> 40:40.651
<i>It was a rough year.</i>

40:40.689 --> 40:42.899
<i>I call that "the bad times."</i>

40:45.152 --> 40:48.152
She had taken this dog leash

40:48.196 --> 40:50.856
and clipped it to a pair of handcuffs,

40:50.907 --> 40:53.367
and clipped the handcuffs to the bed

40:53.410 --> 40:57.660
and kept... it was like
that for about two weeks.

40:57.706 --> 41:00.996
My mom had actually convinced a lawyer

41:01.042 --> 41:04.542
to draw up some papers saying
that I was incompetent.

41:04.588 --> 41:07.628
So I thought if I had tried
to go to the police,

41:07.674 --> 41:11.384
they'd look at these papers
and say, "She's retarded.

41:11.428 --> 41:14.098
She doesn't know what she's talking about."

41:14.139 --> 41:15.889
Gypsy has essentially fallen

41:15.932 --> 41:18.562
through every crack there is in the system.

41:18.602 --> 41:20.352
The Greene County sheriff's deputies

41:20.395 --> 41:23.395
came out to the house
on an anonymous report

41:23.440 --> 41:26.110
that Gypsy was potentially being abused.

41:26.151 --> 41:29.401
And they came to the house,
they spoke with Dee Dee,

41:29.446 --> 41:33.316
and Dee Dee did exactly what
she does all the time...

41:33.366 --> 41:35.736
She manipulated the police officers,

41:35.785 --> 41:38.825
showed them a few things, and they left.

41:38.872 --> 41:40.292
And at that point,

41:40.332 --> 41:44.002
Gypsy has absolutely nowhere else to turn.

41:44.044 --> 41:45.384
Literally everyone failed her.

41:45.420 --> 41:47.050
Literally.

41:47.088 --> 41:49.418
<i>The doctors who were positioned</i>

41:49.466 --> 41:53.296
as there to help her didn't help her.

41:53.345 --> 41:55.085
<i>Her father,</i>

41:55.138 --> 41:58.508
<i>who I think was in a
very difficult position,</i>

41:58.558 --> 41:59.928
<i>couldn't help her.</i>

42:01.561 --> 42:04.441
How was she supposed to
think anybody could?

42:04.481 --> 42:06.334
I was just kind of at that
point where you're like,

42:06.358 --> 42:10.858
"I'm angry at the world
and this is unfair."

42:10.904 --> 42:15.454
Why couldn't anybody figure this
out before it got this bad?

42:21.665 --> 42:25.325
<i>Gypsy. Over here, baby.</i>

42:25.377 --> 42:29.457
We all kind of did see how Gypsy
was being treated by Dee Dee,

42:29.506 --> 42:33.336
not that it was like horrible,
beating the shit out of her

42:33.385 --> 42:35.835
in the back room with a
freaking cable, you know?

42:35.887 --> 42:39.057
She would just... she put her
in a wheelchair and told her,

42:39.099 --> 42:42.019
"Your leg's messed up. You can't walk."

42:46.439 --> 42:49.319
Her sister told me once, "Rod, you know,

42:49.359 --> 42:51.359
Gypsy can walk."

42:51.403 --> 42:53.283
And I asked Dee Dee about it.

42:53.321 --> 42:56.781
She's like, "Yeah, well,
with her muscular dystrophy

42:56.825 --> 43:00.945
or with her disease, her
muscles hurt sometimes.

43:00.996 --> 43:03.826
So sometimes she can walk
when she's feeling okay,

43:03.873 --> 43:05.583
but it's progressive.

43:05.625 --> 43:07.415
It's going to get worse."

43:07.460 --> 43:11.340
And it wasn't long after
that that they were...

43:11.381 --> 43:13.841
They started moving
further and further away.

43:13.883 --> 43:16.763
And there was nobody there to question...

43:16.803 --> 43:19.473
Question that anymore, you know?

43:19.514 --> 43:23.734
After all of the doors had been closed...

43:23.768 --> 43:26.688
Family, friends, the police...

43:26.730 --> 43:30.520
I think that Gypsy felt she had no other...

43:30.567 --> 43:31.767
No other avenue.

43:36.489 --> 43:41.239
<i>I met Nick through a
Christian dating website.</i>

43:41.286 --> 43:43.446
<i>He was one of the profiles that I had saw.</i>

43:43.496 --> 43:46.576
<i>Thought he was cute, so I checked
him out, sent him a wink.</i>

43:46.624 --> 43:48.584
<i>He sent me one back.</i>

44:00.221 --> 44:03.601
<i>Once you met on there, what happened?</i>

44:03.641 --> 44:06.431
<i>We got closer on there,</i>

44:06.478 --> 44:10.228
<i>and we connected more and more.</i>

44:15.695 --> 44:17.855
<i>The way that we clicked,</i>

44:17.906 --> 44:20.616
<i>we somehow just knew we
were right for each other.</i>

44:24.829 --> 44:28.619
<i>Four days later, we started
a relationship together.</i>

44:36.633 --> 44:41.223
<i>Gypsy had no template for romance</i>

44:41.262 --> 44:45.772
<i>that wasn't this sort of heightened
Prince Charming narrative.</i>

44:48.603 --> 44:50.523
And Nick just happened to be there.

44:52.023 --> 44:53.523
<i>His background equipped him</i>

44:53.566 --> 44:55.226
<i>with a bad narrative in different ways.</i>

44:55.276 --> 44:57.026
So, it was like two bad narratives

44:57.070 --> 44:58.610
collided with each other.

44:58.655 --> 45:01.445
<i>What kind of person... If
somebody never met him,</i>

45:01.491 --> 45:02.951
<i>what kind of person is Nick?</i>

45:02.992 --> 45:06.122
<i>He's pretty quiet, kept
to himself, you know.</i>

45:06.162 --> 45:09.502
<i>We always tell him he's got to
get out and mingle, you know.</i>

45:09.541 --> 45:12.671
<i>- Sure.
- But he's like, "I'm afraid of getting backstabbed,</i>

45:12.710 --> 45:15.420
<i>because everybody backstabs
you," and all that stuff.</i>

45:15.463 --> 45:18.513
<i>He has autism, you know, Asperger's.</i>

45:18.550 --> 45:21.630
<i>Has he been diagnosed with
autism and Asperger's?</i>

45:21.678 --> 45:23.088
<i>- Yes.
- Okay.</i>

45:23.138 --> 45:24.888
<i>Last doctor he talked to,</i>

45:24.931 --> 45:27.641
<i>they said his mind is probably
always going to be 15, 16,</i>

45:27.684 --> 45:29.524
<i>right around there.</i>

45:29.561 --> 45:31.811
At first, it was all
lighthearted, you know.

45:31.855 --> 45:33.305
"If you got married,

45:33.356 --> 45:35.042
where would you like to
have your honeymoon?"

45:35.066 --> 45:36.976
You know, "Where would
you like to get married?"

45:37.026 --> 45:38.826
Where are all the places
you want to travel?"

45:38.862 --> 45:41.282
Different things like that, normal stuff.

45:41.322 --> 45:44.282
And as it progressed, things got weird.

45:46.494 --> 45:49.754
He started talking about
something called BDSM.

46:04.429 --> 46:06.099
<i>And at first, I didn't know what it was,</i>

46:06.139 --> 46:08.219
<i>so I looked it up.</i>

46:08.266 --> 46:11.346
And once I looked it up, I was
like, "I don't want to do this."

46:11.394 --> 46:14.694
And then he kind of just talked me into it

46:14.731 --> 46:17.731
and was like, "It'll be fine," you know?

46:17.775 --> 46:19.395
"Try this with me."

46:19.444 --> 46:22.744
And so, I agreed to it.

46:25.658 --> 46:29.288
<i>I was taught that a woman's
role is to be submissive</i>

46:29.329 --> 46:31.039
<i>and the man is dominant,</i>

46:31.080 --> 46:33.580
<i>so I didn't think it was that outlandish.</i>

46:36.377 --> 46:40.837
<i>Then his ex had messaged me.</i>

46:40.882 --> 46:45.092
She told me, you know,
he's a really bad guy.

46:45.136 --> 46:47.386
He thinks he's a vampire

46:47.430 --> 46:51.060
and he's into all this
dominant/submissive stuff.

46:51.100 --> 46:53.140
And I was thinking, it's just an ex.

46:53.186 --> 46:55.556
You know, she's just badmouthing him.

46:55.605 --> 46:59.225
She doesn't know anything. She's
jealous, blah, blah, blah.

46:59.275 --> 47:00.775
She was right.

47:00.818 --> 47:03.068
<i>Godejohn also has a criminal past.</i>

47:03.112 --> 47:05.862
<i>In 2013 he was arrested
after investigators say</i>

47:05.907 --> 47:08.617
<i>he was watching pornography
and fondling himself</i>

47:08.660 --> 47:11.240
<i>in a McDonald's restaurant for nine hours,</i>

47:11.287 --> 47:14.407
<i>police finding a large
knife during the arrest.</i>

47:14.457 --> 47:17.457
I really don't know what's wrong with him,

47:17.502 --> 47:21.422
but, I mean, it's not like I
ever had a boyfriend before,

47:21.464 --> 47:25.514
so I really didn't know what
was a normal relationship.

47:25.552 --> 47:28.012
<i>How don't know how much she
told you about me, but...</i>

47:30.431 --> 47:32.221
<i>Have you been diagnosed with that?</i>

47:32.267 --> 47:33.847
<i>I probably should be diagnosed with it</i>

47:33.893 --> 47:35.773
<i>because it... it happens...</i>

47:35.812 --> 47:38.482
<i>The thing is, I used to take a medication.</i>

47:38.523 --> 47:40.943
<i>I used to hear voices in my head.
Then it went away.</i>

47:40.984 --> 47:43.574
<i>And then somehow it's a part of myself.</i>

47:43.611 --> 47:46.281
<i>Okay. Does Gypsy know that?</i>

47:46.322 --> 47:48.952
<i>- Yes. She does know that.
- Okay.</i>

47:48.992 --> 47:51.992
His multiple personalities would come out,

47:52.036 --> 47:55.616
and he had talked to me one day

47:55.665 --> 47:58.035
and he was just like,
"You know, I would like

47:58.084 --> 48:01.384
my other personalities
to have a girlfriend."

48:01.421 --> 48:04.711
So I made up some individual personalities

48:04.757 --> 48:07.677
to match his other personalities.

48:19.355 --> 48:21.645
<i>One side of her is named Kitty.</i>

48:21.691 --> 48:23.691
<i>It's like a little girl inside of her.</i>

48:26.362 --> 48:28.862
<i>We had another one called Candy.</i>

48:32.869 --> 48:35.119
<i>She has an evil side of herself as well.</i>

48:35.163 --> 48:36.703
<i>She used to call her Ruby.</i>

48:38.875 --> 48:41.875
<i>It was deaf, dumb, blind love.</i>

48:45.173 --> 48:47.593
And sometimes, it's a big crazy love.

48:47.634 --> 48:51.144
<i>One of the most interesting
things about this case</i>

48:51.179 --> 48:53.299
<i>is that no matter how much control</i>

48:53.348 --> 48:55.218
<i>you have over an individual,</i>

48:55.266 --> 48:58.556
<i>you can't stop adolescent
sexuality from blossoming.</i>

48:59.937 --> 49:02.357
<i>Her whole life,</i>

49:02.398 --> 49:05.518
this had been a subject
that was forbidden to her,

49:05.568 --> 49:07.938
and, ultimately,

49:07.987 --> 49:10.107
that turned into a really
destructive force.

49:17.413 --> 49:20.463
<i>Probably about a year
into our relationship,</i>

49:20.500 --> 49:23.170
<i>I just couldn't lie to him anymore.</i>

49:23.211 --> 49:26.751
And I just told him everything.

49:26.798 --> 49:29.338
<i>Why did nobody know she could walk?</i>

49:29.384 --> 49:32.554
<i>Her mom wanted everyone to think</i>

49:32.595 --> 49:34.925
<i>that she was, like, 16 the entire time.</i>

49:34.972 --> 49:39.892
<i>So, yeah, she felt kind of
trapped on a wheelchair</i>

49:39.936 --> 49:42.556
<i>when I actually was trying to encourage her</i>

49:42.605 --> 49:44.285
<i>to be able to walk more and more and more.</i>

49:47.568 --> 49:50.738
<i>It really didn't come up, like,
"I want you to kill her."</i>

49:52.281 --> 49:56.121
But he had said, "I'll
protect you from anybody."

49:56.160 --> 49:58.240
And I said, "Anybody?"

49:58.287 --> 50:00.117
And he said, "Yeah."

50:00.164 --> 50:02.924
And I said, "Even my mom?"

50:02.959 --> 50:04.629
And he said, "Yeah."

50:04.669 --> 50:07.129
And that's where it kind of
developed from there on.

50:08.506 --> 50:10.256
<i>We'd call it "plan B."</i>

50:13.511 --> 50:15.511
<i>But we always pushed it back.</i>

50:15.555 --> 50:17.175
<i>You know, it was just a thought.</i>

50:17.223 --> 50:18.643
<i>It was never reality.</i>

50:20.059 --> 50:22.309
<i>We'll consider other options.</i>

50:25.148 --> 50:30.738
<i>We had planned a meeting
at a movie theater.</i>

50:30.778 --> 50:33.068
I and my mom was going
to go see "Cinderella,"

50:33.114 --> 50:35.494
the live-action version of "Cinderella,"

50:35.533 --> 50:39.793
and I was like, "This is a
perfect time for us to meet.

50:39.829 --> 50:42.869
<i>I'll buy your ticket, and you
come to the movie theater.</i>

50:42.915 --> 50:46.285
<i>We'll meet like we're just
meeting as new friends,</i>

50:46.335 --> 50:49.495
<i>and it's going to be perfect."</i>

50:49.547 --> 50:51.757
<i>She wanted to have sex with me, so I did.</i>

50:51.799 --> 50:53.419
<i>Okay, she wanted to have sex with you?</i>

50:53.468 --> 50:55.758
<i>- Yes.
- Wow, did her mom know?</i>

50:55.803 --> 50:58.263
<i>Um, we kept it from her mom.</i>

50:58.306 --> 51:01.346
<i>Okay. Where did you have
sex at in the theater?</i>

51:01.392 --> 51:02.772
<i>- It was in the bathroom.
- Okay.</i>

51:02.810 --> 51:04.890
<i>In the girls' bathroom or boys' bathroom?</i>

51:04.937 --> 51:07.647
<i>She just took me in the boys' bathroom.
I didn't have any choice.</i>

51:07.690 --> 51:09.835
<i>We went right into the boys' bathroom.
She was okay with it.</i>

51:09.859 --> 51:11.899
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

51:11.944 --> 51:14.423
<i>And then what happened after you
guys had sex in the theater?</i>

51:14.447 --> 51:18.987
<i>We went to our movie and watched it.</i>

51:19.035 --> 51:21.985
<i>They're all looking at you.</i>

51:22.038 --> 51:24.118
<i>Believe me,</i>

51:24.165 --> 51:26.165
<i>they are all looking at you.</i>

51:27.668 --> 51:29.628
<i>I don't know what it was, but, apparently,</i>

51:29.670 --> 51:31.960
<i>the night got ruined in some way.</i>

51:32.006 --> 51:34.916
<i>I couldn't... I was trying to understand</i>

51:34.967 --> 51:36.837
<i>what was going on with her mom.</i>

51:36.886 --> 51:39.466
She despised him.

51:39.514 --> 51:42.264
She was like, "He's creepy. He's weird."

51:42.308 --> 51:45.308
He's coming to see a kids'
movie alone by himself."

51:45.353 --> 51:48.193
<i>And now looking back on
it, yeah, it is weird.</i>

51:48.231 --> 51:50.311
<i>We were the only people at the movies,</i>

51:50.358 --> 51:53.108
and he didn't have a kid with him

51:53.152 --> 51:55.322
or a girlfriend or nothing.

51:55.363 --> 52:00.243
He's just this guy going
to see this chick movie.

52:00.284 --> 52:01.845
Couldn't you have said
that you have a friend

52:01.869 --> 52:03.489
and you want to introduce them?

52:03.538 --> 52:06.368
I wouldn't have had no way
to meet him, you know?

52:06.415 --> 52:09.825
I can't say I met him online or...

52:09.877 --> 52:12.037
She's... she was all the time with me,

52:12.088 --> 52:15.628
so there would be no
other time to meet him.

52:17.218 --> 52:22.428
Once all of those plans
seemed to fall apart,

52:22.473 --> 52:24.273
I just got desperate.

52:48.082 --> 52:50.082
<i>He took a Greyhound bus.</i>

52:50.126 --> 52:52.416
<i>I managed to scrape up enough money</i>

52:52.461 --> 52:54.461
<i>to pay for him a ticket.</i>

52:57.842 --> 53:00.802
<i>And the next day, we went
to the grocery store,</i>

53:00.845 --> 53:03.385
<i>came back home.</i>

53:03.431 --> 53:05.511
She went to sleep very, very late,

53:05.558 --> 53:07.978
and I was up texting Nick.

53:27.622 --> 53:29.832
We painted each other's nails.

53:32.335 --> 53:35.165
And I acted like everything was fine.

53:39.508 --> 53:42.468
We had just recently got into an argument,

53:42.511 --> 53:45.261
and we had made up.

53:45.306 --> 53:47.966
And I said I was going to be a good girl.

53:49.435 --> 53:52.895
And then she went to sleep

53:52.939 --> 53:56.019
because I hurt her feelings or something.

53:56.067 --> 53:59.857
She said, "I'm starting
to feel more relaxed.

53:59.904 --> 54:01.704
Don't hurt me."

54:06.035 --> 54:09.075
The last words she said to
me was "don't hurt me."

54:26.138 --> 54:28.468
I went into the bathroom.

54:28.516 --> 54:31.726
I got kind of in a fetal position

54:31.769 --> 54:33.599
and I covered my ears.

54:33.646 --> 54:37.686
And I heard my mom wake up.

54:39.151 --> 54:42.031
And then she sounded startled.

54:42.071 --> 54:47.121
And there was some noises
that I can't make out,

54:47.159 --> 54:52.909
and I heard her say my name a couple times.

54:54.458 --> 54:59.168
And she said, "Help me."

54:59.213 --> 55:00.883
And then there was just silence.

55:03.509 --> 55:04.969
Did she scream?

55:07.263 --> 55:08.603
Yeah.

55:13.436 --> 55:16.146
<i>This is about as clear
a premeditated murder</i>

55:16.188 --> 55:18.398
<i>as I've ever seen.</i>

55:19.817 --> 55:22.687
<i>It's brutal.</i>

55:22.737 --> 55:25.197
<i>And I think it would be
very hard for anybody</i>

55:25.239 --> 55:28.699
<i>to not have a moment of being taken aback.</i>

55:28.743 --> 55:32.453
<i>Did you have sex with Dee Dee?</i>

55:32.496 --> 55:34.996
<i>- No.
- You didn't stick your penis anywhere on her?</i>

55:35.041 --> 55:36.461
<i>- Nope.
- Are you sure?</i>

55:36.500 --> 55:38.000
<i>- Yep.
- Positive?</i>

55:38.044 --> 55:39.844
<i>- I'm 100% positive.
- Okay.</i>

55:39.879 --> 55:41.959
<i>Did you stick your penis in her mouth?</i>

55:42.006 --> 55:43.416
<i>- Nope.
- Okay.</i>

55:43.466 --> 55:45.626
<i>Did your penis touch
anywhere on Dee Dee's body?</i>

55:45.676 --> 55:47.046
<i>- Nope.
- Okay.</i>

55:47.094 --> 55:49.014
<i>Did your mouth touch
anywhere on Dee Dee's body?</i>

55:49.055 --> 55:50.545
<i>- My mouth? No.
- Okay.</i>

55:50.598 --> 55:52.388
<i>- You didn't kiss her or...
- Nope.</i>

55:52.433 --> 55:54.733
<i>- ...lick her or anything like that?
- Nope.</i>

55:54.769 --> 55:57.059
<i>Okay. What do you think about people</i>

55:57.104 --> 55:59.564
<i>that have sex with dead bodies?</i>

55:59.607 --> 56:02.147
<i>I mean, it's quite disturbing, honestly.</i>

56:02.193 --> 56:04.403
<i>Okay, that's... That would bother you?</i>

56:04.445 --> 56:06.565
<i>Yeah. I don't like necrophilia.</i>

56:06.614 --> 56:09.114
<i>Okay, because I think one of the things</i>

56:09.158 --> 56:11.738
<i>that she might have said
was that you had mentioned</i>

56:11.786 --> 56:13.736
<i>that you'd like to rape her mom.</i>

56:13.788 --> 56:17.458
<i>- Yeah, at one point, I was thinking about it.
- Okay.</i>

56:17.500 --> 56:19.370
He had wanted to rape my mother.

56:19.418 --> 56:20.878
That's what he wanted to do.

56:20.920 --> 56:22.670
He was like, "I'm going to kill her,

56:22.713 --> 56:25.673
but I'm going to do it my way,
and I'm going to rape her."

56:25.716 --> 56:29.046
So what I did was I made a deal with him.

56:29.095 --> 56:34.175
I'd let him rape me, and...

56:34.225 --> 56:37.015
And then he wouldn't... He
wouldn't do that to my mom.

56:39.980 --> 56:42.480
<i>- So you guys have sex.
- Yes.</i>

56:42.525 --> 56:46.145
<i>And what kind of sex?
What is sex like to you?</i>

56:46.195 --> 56:50.485
<i>Well, to me, the kind of sex that it was</i>

56:50.533 --> 56:54.453
<i>was pretty much kind of con... consensual?</i>

56:54.495 --> 56:56.905
<i>Is that the word I'm looking for?</i>

56:56.956 --> 57:00.036
<i>- Like, are you biting her?
- Are you punching her?</i>

57:00.084 --> 57:02.674
<i>No, no, I would never lay my hands on her.</i>

57:02.711 --> 57:05.051
<i>I didn't even bite her at all, actually.</i>

57:05.089 --> 57:08.169
<i>Not for a long time, that is.</i>

57:08.217 --> 57:11.087
<i>The very first time, she
whispered in my ear</i>

57:11.137 --> 57:13.467
<i>that that was a turn-on of hers is biting.</i>

57:13.514 --> 57:14.764
<i>- I bit her twice.
- Okay.</i>

57:14.807 --> 57:16.597
<i>The first time I can't remember.</i>

57:16.642 --> 57:19.692
<i>The second time I remember,
because I bit her a lot harder.</i>

57:19.728 --> 57:21.978
<i>However, she seemed to still enjoy it</i>

57:22.022 --> 57:24.272
<i>even though it was really hard.</i>

57:24.316 --> 57:27.726
<i>Technically, once we got to that point,</i>

57:27.778 --> 57:30.858
I screamed for him to stop, and he didn't.

57:30.906 --> 57:34.776
<i>So I don't consider it to be consensual.</i>

57:39.331 --> 57:41.041
<i>Okay, all right.</i>

57:41.083 --> 57:43.293
<i>Is there a reason you didn't feel pleasure?</i>

57:43.335 --> 57:46.955
<i>I don't know. It's really hard to say.</i>

57:47.006 --> 57:49.796
<i>I did make her have an orgasm once.</i>

57:49.842 --> 57:54.222
<i>- Okay.
- And then after that, I... she might've blew me a bit.</i>

57:54.263 --> 57:57.313
<i>And then after that, I think
we stopped because we realized</i>

57:57.349 --> 57:58.994
<i>there was a lot of packing and stuff to do.</i>

57:59.018 --> 58:01.098
<i>Okay, so you guys get everything packed.</i>

58:01.145 --> 58:02.765
<i>She wipes down the fingerprints.</i>

58:02.813 --> 58:04.313
<i>And then what do you guys do?</i>

58:04.356 --> 58:09.106
<i>We get in a taxi and we get to the hotel.</i>

58:14.491 --> 58:15.911
<i>Hi, honey.</i>

58:18.954 --> 58:20.454
<i>I'm filming.</i>

58:34.345 --> 58:36.595
<i>He's eating a brownie!</i>

58:38.766 --> 58:41.266
<i>But later, he will be eating me!</i>

58:44.563 --> 58:47.403
<i>I loved Nick very much at that time,</i>

58:47.441 --> 58:50.441
and being with him felt exciting

58:50.486 --> 58:53.696
because I was with someone I loved

58:53.739 --> 58:55.819
and someone I thought cared for me.

59:00.412 --> 59:03.372
<i>We took a Greyhound bus back to Wisconsin.</i>

59:06.502 --> 59:10.302
<i>My mind wasn't thinking back
to what was at my house.</i>

59:10.339 --> 59:12.509
<i>I just kept thinking, "I'm free, I'm free,"</i>

59:12.549 --> 59:16.339
<i>and that excitement of
being free and walking.</i>

59:17.972 --> 59:20.892
I always reference myself
to this little bluebird

59:20.933 --> 59:23.393
that was trapped in an invisible cage,

59:23.435 --> 59:27.845
and I felt like this bluebird was set free.

59:27.898 --> 59:29.608
<i>Did you guys talk about your future?</i>

59:29.650 --> 59:31.690
<i>What was your plans for your future?</i>

59:31.735 --> 59:35.645
<i>We wanted to have a family together,</i>

59:35.698 --> 59:39.278
<i>and we wanted to build a
life together and stuff.</i>

59:39.326 --> 59:41.986
<i>We thought we really had a chance to do it,</i>

59:42.037 --> 59:43.827
<i>so we were happy about that.</i>

01:00:02.725 --> 01:00:05.555
<i>Does your mom and stepdad
know what you did?</i>

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:07.272
<i>No, they don't.</i>

01:00:07.313 --> 01:00:09.603
<i>And this is the first
time they ever met Gypsy?</i>

01:00:09.648 --> 01:00:11.148
<i>Yeah. In person, yes.</i>

01:00:11.191 --> 01:00:13.941
<i>Okay, and they agreed
to let her live there?</i>

01:00:13.986 --> 01:00:15.356
<i>- Yep.
- Okay.</i>

01:00:17.865 --> 01:00:20.525
<i>What did you do think about Gypsy?</i>

01:00:20.576 --> 01:00:24.996
<i>You know, it was weird because
when I picked them up</i>

01:00:25.039 --> 01:00:27.619
<i>from the bus station, I even asked her,</i>

01:00:27.666 --> 01:00:29.326
<i>"How's your mom doing? How is your..."</i>

01:00:29.376 --> 01:00:31.876
<i>'Cause I was told she was
in a homeless shelter.</i>

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:33.090
<i>Her mom kicked her out.</i>

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:34.670
<i>So I asked her how her mom was doing.</i>

01:00:34.715 --> 01:00:36.755
<i>This might have been the
first thing I asked her.</i>

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:39.630
<i>No big deal, They acted like nothing.</i>

01:00:39.678 --> 01:00:41.048
<i>What was your impression?</i>

01:00:41.096 --> 01:00:43.386
<i>Did you feel like there was anything wrong?</i>

01:00:43.432 --> 01:00:45.493
<i>- Did you feel like everything was good?
- Everything seemed normal.</i>

01:00:45.517 --> 01:00:47.746
<i>The only thing that freaked me
out is she was wearing a wig.</i>

01:00:47.770 --> 01:00:49.560
<i>Okay.</i>

01:00:49.605 --> 01:00:51.895
<i>Did you remember getting in the mail</i>

01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:55.730
<i>an envelope or anything addressed to
Nick or Gypsy or anything like that?</i>

01:00:55.778 --> 01:01:01.568
<i>There was one that just came in...
hmm... Saturday?</i>

01:01:01.617 --> 01:01:03.947
<i>I have no idea what was in it.</i>

01:01:03.994 --> 01:01:06.044
<i>That was my next question.</i>

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:08.830
<i>I don't</i> go through mail. <i>- Okay.</i>

01:01:08.874 --> 01:01:12.044
<i>Maybe I should have.</i>

01:01:12.086 --> 01:01:14.272
<i>- That was the night that he had stabbed her to death.
- What?</i>

01:01:14.296 --> 01:01:17.206
<i>They mailed it from their
house there to your house.</i>

01:01:17.257 --> 01:01:19.127
<i>- Are you serious?
- Yes, ma'am.</i>

01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:22.136
<i>- Oh, my God.
- And that was located in your house.</i>

01:01:22.179 --> 01:01:24.179
<i>My God.</i>

01:01:24.223 --> 01:01:26.523
<i>I think there was a little...</i>

01:01:26.558 --> 01:01:30.558
<i>Around $4,000-5,000 of cash</i>

01:01:30.604 --> 01:01:32.814
<i>that they had stolen from her mom.</i>

01:01:32.856 --> 01:01:35.396
<i>My God.</i>

01:01:35.442 --> 01:01:36.878
<i>Did you see the Facebook
post where it says...</i>

01:01:36.902 --> 01:01:38.572
<i>- No.
- Okay, that's right.</i>

01:01:38.612 --> 01:01:41.862
<i>On Dee and Gypsy's Facebook
post that they share,</i>

01:01:41.907 --> 01:01:43.947
<i>there are some horrible messages</i>

01:01:43.992 --> 01:01:45.952
<i>that were posted on there
that said, like...</i>

01:01:45.994 --> 01:01:48.084
<i>I believe, like, they slashed her...</i>

01:01:48.122 --> 01:01:49.752
<i>Like, "I slashed her. I killed her.</i>

01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:51.920
<i>And then I raped the girl,
and the girl's dead, too."</i>

01:01:51.959 --> 01:01:55.339
<i>Well, those all were
actually posted by Gypsy.</i>

01:01:57.589 --> 01:02:00.299
<i>Startlingly with Gypsy,</i>

01:02:00.342 --> 01:02:03.722
<i>who went online to announce, you know,</i>

01:02:03.762 --> 01:02:08.102
"That bitch is dead,"
and to go even further

01:02:08.142 --> 01:02:12.522
<i>and describe a scenario where she was raped</i>

01:02:12.563 --> 01:02:14.603
<i>is just perverse.</i>

01:02:14.648 --> 01:02:17.568
It implies a fair degree of sociopathy.

01:02:17.609 --> 01:02:21.109
<i>Just the way the girl acted...</i>

01:02:21.155 --> 01:02:23.985
<i>I mean, how can you do
something to your mother</i>

01:02:24.032 --> 01:02:26.282
<i>and lose your mother,
and just act like that?</i>

01:02:26.326 --> 01:02:30.576
<i>I was like... I'm just trying
to wrap my head around it.</i>

01:02:30.622 --> 01:02:32.662
<i>I mean, they acted like two normal people.</i>

01:02:32.708 --> 01:02:35.378
<i>- Yeah.
- That's what's really freaky.</i>

01:02:35.419 --> 01:02:37.999
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:02:38.046 --> 01:02:39.706
<i>How can you do that?</i>

01:02:41.758 --> 01:02:43.968
<i>Gypsy might have been
the mastermind herself.</i>

01:02:44.011 --> 01:02:45.841
I think it's most anybody's instinct to,

01:02:45.888 --> 01:02:48.758
"Oh, shit, you murdered
your mother," you know?

01:02:48.807 --> 01:02:51.847
Watch that girl.

01:02:51.894 --> 01:02:54.394
Don't turn your back.
You she might stab you.

01:02:57.774 --> 01:03:01.114
<i>I do think Gypsy is potentially dangerous.</i>

01:03:02.529 --> 01:03:04.699
Dee Dee was a master manipulator,

01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:07.200
and it's impossible that Gypsy would not

01:03:07.242 --> 01:03:09.372
have picked this up and used it.

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:15.370
<i>- Yeah.
- You know?</i>

01:03:17.085 --> 01:03:19.455
<i>I know. I mean, that's the
way it works, though,</i>

01:03:19.505 --> 01:03:21.085
<i>when you have what he has.</i>

01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:23.551
<i>Your mind focuses on one thing.
Do you know what I mean?</i>

01:03:23.592 --> 01:03:25.262
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

01:03:25.302 --> 01:03:28.092
<i>Do you think that if Gypsy hadn't
asked you to kill her mom,</i>

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:29.508
<i>you'd have ever killed her mom?</i>

01:03:29.556 --> 01:03:30.886
<i>I know I wouldn't have done it.</i>

01:03:30.933 --> 01:03:32.813
<i>Okay. You just did it
because you loved Gypsy</i>

01:03:32.851 --> 01:03:34.141
<i>and Gypsy asked you to do it.</i>

01:03:34.186 --> 01:03:35.386
<i>Is that what I'm thinking?</i>

01:03:35.437 --> 01:03:36.807
<i>- Yes.
- Okay.</i>

01:03:36.855 --> 01:03:40.645
<i>For him to ruin his life over that,</i>

01:03:40.692 --> 01:03:43.782
<i>I'm sorry, but she's a beast.</i>

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:45.820
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:03:45.864 --> 01:03:49.284
She now doesn't have a language

01:03:49.326 --> 01:03:52.736
beyond manipulation and retaliation.

01:03:52.788 --> 01:03:55.908
<i>I mean, is she taking any sort of...</i>

01:03:55.958 --> 01:03:59.208
<i>You know, is she like, "Well,
okay, it was me, too,"</i>

01:03:59.253 --> 01:04:00.772
<i>or is she to trying to put it all on Nick?</i>

01:04:00.796 --> 01:04:02.126
<i>She...</i>

01:04:03.799 --> 01:04:06.129
<i>takes some responsibility,</i>

01:04:06.176 --> 01:04:09.466
<i>but not much.</i>

01:04:09.513 --> 01:04:11.223
<i>Not much at all.</i>

01:04:11.265 --> 01:04:13.715
<i>- Did you kill your mom?
- No. No, sir.</i>

01:04:13.767 --> 01:04:15.387
<i>- Did you help?
- No, sir.</i>

01:04:15.435 --> 01:04:18.765
<i>- No one else killed your mom?
- No, sir.</i>

01:04:18.814 --> 01:04:20.904
<i>No, sir.</i>

01:04:20.941 --> 01:04:22.691
<i>Did you have knowledge that Nicholas</i>

01:04:22.734 --> 01:04:25.114
<i>was going to kill your
mom before he did it?</i>

01:04:25.153 --> 01:04:26.283
<i>No, sir.</i>

01:04:29.449 --> 01:04:30.989
<i>Okay. Sit tight for me, okay?</i>

01:04:31.034 --> 01:04:32.494
<i>It's okay.</i>

01:04:47.634 --> 01:04:49.934
I wonder if people feel that Gypsy

01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:52.010
is telling them the truth now.

01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:57.729
<i>Hello, you have a call from...</i>

01:04:57.769 --> 01:05:00.519
<i>Gypsy Rose.</i>

01:05:00.564 --> 01:05:05.114
She was still in Wisconsin
when she called me.

01:05:05.152 --> 01:05:07.242
<i>Hey, my sweetie.</i>

01:05:07.279 --> 01:05:10.239
<i>Hi! Is this Kristy?</i>

01:05:10.282 --> 01:05:11.782
<i>Yes, baby.</i>

01:05:11.825 --> 01:05:13.575
<i>Hi! Oh, my God.</i>

01:05:13.619 --> 01:05:15.989
<i>It's so good to hear your voice.</i>

01:05:16.038 --> 01:05:21.328
At that time, she still wasn't
trusting, really, anyone.

01:05:21.376 --> 01:05:27.006
She was still not telling Mike everything.

01:05:27.049 --> 01:05:28.839
<i>I'm innocent.</i>

01:05:28.884 --> 01:05:31.764
<i>It's a complicated situation,</i>

01:05:31.803 --> 01:05:36.263
<i>but what they say on the news is not true.</i>

01:05:36.308 --> 01:05:38.978
Then we went in the courtroom,

01:05:39.019 --> 01:05:43.019
<i>and that's when they showed
all the text messaging.</i>

01:05:43.065 --> 01:05:45.765
<i>And when they said they
were presenting that,</i>

01:05:45.817 --> 01:05:48.687
<i>she turned around and looked at us</i>

01:05:48.737 --> 01:05:51.567
<i>with fear in her eyes.</i>

01:05:51.615 --> 01:05:54.775
I guess she didn't think
that they were going to pull

01:05:54.826 --> 01:05:56.736
all of those messages up.

01:06:00.082 --> 01:06:02.252
Yeah, I did.

01:06:13.929 --> 01:06:15.349
They didn't get caught red-handed,

01:06:15.389 --> 01:06:17.179
but they got caught red-handed.

01:06:17.224 --> 01:06:18.774
You know, they have a lot of evidence.

01:06:18.809 --> 01:06:23.229
They have the murder weapon, texts, videos.

01:06:23.271 --> 01:06:27.271
I mean, no doubt they did it
or planned it and everything,

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:31.357
so it was just a matter of why they did it,

01:06:31.405 --> 01:06:33.655
you know, and is that reasonable?

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:36.990
Are you happy that your mom

01:06:37.035 --> 01:06:39.235
is not here to abuse you anymore?

01:06:40.956 --> 01:06:42.786
Yeah.

01:06:42.833 --> 01:06:46.673
But at the same time, I'm
not happy that she's dead.

01:06:46.712 --> 01:06:48.382
You know, I didn't want that.

01:06:48.422 --> 01:06:52.222
I know it sounds strange to plan something

01:06:52.259 --> 01:06:54.759
and go through the steps to make it happen,

01:06:54.803 --> 01:06:58.353
and then... but at the same
time not want it to happen.

01:07:00.392 --> 01:07:02.852
One of the problems with the legal system

01:07:02.894 --> 01:07:05.104
is that it demands that people
have this one intention

01:07:05.147 --> 01:07:08.267
and this one moment in time
and be certain about it,

01:07:08.316 --> 01:07:10.276
and I'm not sure that that really happens.

01:07:10.318 --> 01:07:13.648
And especially in this case,
I'm not sure that it happens.

01:07:13.697 --> 01:07:16.777
It's possible that Gypsy had
ultimately ambivalent feelings

01:07:16.825 --> 01:07:19.445
about killing her mother.

01:07:19.494 --> 01:07:21.180
I wonder what she was
thinking in the other room

01:07:21.204 --> 01:07:23.334
listening to her mother
screaming sometimes.

01:07:23.373 --> 01:07:26.213
I didn't think anything.

01:07:26.251 --> 01:07:28.171
I was scared.

01:07:28.211 --> 01:07:31.171
I was shaking.

01:07:31.214 --> 01:07:34.014
I just... I didn't have
a thought in my brain.

01:07:37.012 --> 01:07:39.182
<i>It was like it was all not real.</i>

01:07:41.892 --> 01:07:45.232
I was on a bunch of medications,
and I know that's no excuse,

01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:49.190
but on Xanax, I felt like I had no emotion

01:07:49.232 --> 01:07:51.192
and I wasn't thinking right.

01:07:53.612 --> 01:07:57.362
Munchausen by proxy
victims can lose contact

01:07:57.407 --> 01:07:59.117
with reality at times,

01:07:59.159 --> 01:08:01.869
and that may be part of the defense

01:08:01.912 --> 01:08:04.332
in Gypsy's case.

01:08:04.372 --> 01:08:06.962
<i>She may have trouble distinguishing</i>

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.540
<i>what's real and what isn't.</i>

01:08:08.585 --> 01:08:11.125
<i>Is sickness real or is it fake?</i>

01:08:11.171 --> 01:08:15.721
Is death real, or is it
exaggerated or fake?

01:08:15.759 --> 01:08:19.589
<i>So, I think she had limited
capacity for reality testing,</i>

01:08:19.638 --> 01:08:21.928
which just means seeing
what's normal behavior

01:08:21.973 --> 01:08:24.223
and what's really strange behavior.

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:31.939
<i>Gypsy grew up in essentially
an alternate reality</i>

01:08:31.983 --> 01:08:34.903
<i>to what the rest of us live.</i>

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:38.904
<i>By her mother isolating her
from the outside world,</i>

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:43.198
she doesn't know or understand
what normal really is.

01:08:43.245 --> 01:08:44.865
Hi.

01:08:44.912 --> 01:08:46.453
<i>In so many ways,</i>

01:08:46.497 --> 01:08:50.457
<i>I don't know what's right, what's wrong,</i>

01:08:50.502 --> 01:08:55.091
but to say that, yes, I did this.

01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:56.801
I'm sorry for it.

01:08:56.841 --> 01:08:58.932
I feel bad for it.

01:09:00.804 --> 01:09:02.764
It just feels good to be honest.

01:09:17.737 --> 01:09:19.857
<i>The only thing that I
could've done differently</i>

01:09:19.906 --> 01:09:22.566
<i>that I know better now
is reach out to my dad,</i>

01:09:22.617 --> 01:09:24.527
told my dad.

01:09:24.578 --> 01:09:27.078
And he could have came and got me,

01:09:27.122 --> 01:09:28.682
and I would've went and lived with him.

01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:36.899
There's a McDonald's right here

01:09:36.923 --> 01:09:38.633
where I'd visit with Gypsy.

01:09:40.093 --> 01:09:43.183
At that time, she was real young.

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:44.640
I remember one visit...

01:09:46.099 --> 01:09:47.469
she was so scared of me, man.

01:09:47.517 --> 01:09:49.017
She was shaking.

01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:52.350
I don't know what Dee
Dee told her about me,

01:09:52.397 --> 01:09:55.817
but I probably was the big bad
wolf or something, you know?

01:09:55.859 --> 01:10:00.649
Gypsy must have been so confused, you know?

01:10:00.697 --> 01:10:02.341
She was probably telling her the day before

01:10:02.365 --> 01:10:05.325
that, you know, I don't love
her and all this stuff,

01:10:05.368 --> 01:10:09.998
and then here she is visiting
with me and telling her,

01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:12.870
"Look, that's your daddy.
Give him a hug," you know?

01:10:15.253 --> 01:10:18.303
That's old history now, so we're
just going to try to build

01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:21.380
a real father-daughter
intimate relationship,

01:10:21.426 --> 01:10:23.176
you know, like we should have.

01:10:27.307 --> 01:10:29.887
It's hard.

01:10:29.935 --> 01:10:32.635
Thinking what she had to go through

01:10:32.687 --> 01:10:34.977
and that she didn't have
to go through all that.

01:10:35.023 --> 01:10:38.653
- See this?
- Look at that.

01:10:38.693 --> 01:10:41.783
She would probably have
been a perfectly fine kid

01:10:41.821 --> 01:10:44.571
had it not been her mom was Dee Dee.

01:10:46.076 --> 01:10:48.026
Okay, y'all want to get
the table ready or what?

01:10:48.078 --> 01:10:49.868
- Yes.
- We're going to eat off the trays?

01:10:49.913 --> 01:10:51.663
<i>She could've had a normal life.</i>

01:10:51.706 --> 01:10:56.326
I hope she gets out, and
I don't know what...

01:10:56.378 --> 01:10:59.048
What she's going to do when she gets out.

01:10:59.089 --> 01:11:01.169
She was punished enough

01:11:01.216 --> 01:11:04.086
to where they should let her go free.

01:11:04.135 --> 01:11:05.675
That's the way I feel.

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:08.390
'Cause that child's...
She's been through a lot.

01:11:09.683 --> 01:11:11.433
Look at her.

01:11:11.476 --> 01:11:14.686
- Is that Gypsy?
- Yeah, when she was normal.

01:11:19.943 --> 01:11:24.363
I blame myself now for not doing more.

01:11:24.406 --> 01:11:26.196
I mean, it is what it is.

01:11:26.241 --> 01:11:29.201
I'm not a "blame yourself" type of guy,

01:11:29.244 --> 01:11:32.124
but who else is there to look at, you know?

01:12:09.159 --> 01:12:10.829
Okay.

01:12:10.869 --> 01:12:13.289
This is... sorry.

01:12:13.329 --> 01:12:16.829
I didn't realize they were going
to bring you out immediately.

01:12:16.875 --> 01:12:19.625
This is the new charge... Class-A felony

01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:21.419
of murder in the second degree,

01:12:21.463 --> 01:12:23.133
and then acting in concert with another

01:12:23.173 --> 01:12:25.593
who knowingly caused the
death of your mother

01:12:25.633 --> 01:12:28.473
by stabbing her, okay?

01:12:38.104 --> 01:12:39.665
This is in the case of State of Missouri

01:12:39.689 --> 01:12:41.899
v. Gypsy Rose Blanchard.

01:12:41.941 --> 01:12:43.441
Please raise your right hand.

01:12:43.485 --> 01:12:45.205
Do you swear and affirm that the testimony

01:12:45.236 --> 01:12:46.797
you're about to give will be the truth,

01:12:46.821 --> 01:12:48.651
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?

01:12:48.698 --> 01:12:50.448
Yes, sir.

01:12:50.492 --> 01:12:52.303
Would you state your name
for the record, please?

01:12:52.327 --> 01:12:54.737
- Gypsy Blanchard.
- And how old are you?

01:12:54.788 --> 01:12:57.908
I'm going to be 25 years old, but 24.

01:12:57.957 --> 01:13:00.877
<i>Okay. And how far did you go in school?</i>

01:13:00.919 --> 01:13:03.749
About the second grade.

01:13:03.797 --> 01:13:05.917
How do you plead to the class-A felony

01:13:05.965 --> 01:13:07.625
of murder in the second degree?

01:13:07.675 --> 01:13:10.215
- Guilty.
- The court finds that there is

01:13:10.261 --> 01:13:12.641
a factual basis for a plea of guilty.

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:15.060
The court accepts
defendant's plea of guilty

01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:18.060
and finds the defendant guilty
thereof beyond a reasonable doubt.

01:13:18.103 --> 01:13:20.143
She's to be sentenced to 10 years

01:13:20.188 --> 01:13:22.438
in the Missouri Department of Corrections.

01:13:22.482 --> 01:13:24.902
She'll have to do 85% of her sentence

01:13:24.943 --> 01:13:29.203
before she's eligible for parole.

01:13:29.239 --> 01:13:30.529
Let's go off the record.

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:41.750
There you are.

01:13:41.793 --> 01:13:47.173
<i>This case is unusual and extraordinary.</i>

01:13:47.215 --> 01:13:50.255
Gypsy Blanchard endured nearly two decades

01:13:50.301 --> 01:13:54.551
of systematic, purposeful abuse

01:13:54.597 --> 01:13:58.097
at the hands of her mother
for the purpose of fraud.

01:13:58.143 --> 01:14:00.693
And so, by amending to
murder in the second degree,

01:14:00.728 --> 01:14:04.688
we were able to both hold Gypsy
Blanchard accountable for the murder,

01:14:04.732 --> 01:14:07.862
which was not justified nor excusable,

01:14:07.902 --> 01:14:11.782
but yet account for those
mitigating circumstances.

01:14:11.823 --> 01:14:15.323
All of us involved are... It's a relief.

01:14:15.368 --> 01:14:17.288
You know, at the very beginning of this,

01:14:17.328 --> 01:14:20.908
there was the question of the
death penalty on the table.

01:14:20.957 --> 01:14:24.167
Ultimately, it's the best outcome for her.

01:14:24.210 --> 01:14:26.250
It's the best outcome for
the State of Missouri

01:14:26.296 --> 01:14:30.456
and ultimately the right
thing to do for everybody.

01:14:30.508 --> 01:14:32.048
That one's in this pocket.

01:14:32.093 --> 01:14:34.223
Ooh.

01:14:34.262 --> 01:14:36.182
I mean, it's a murder.

01:14:36.222 --> 01:14:37.658
There's nothing we can do about that,

01:14:37.682 --> 01:14:40.852
so, you know, that has to be dealt with.

01:14:40.894 --> 01:14:45.524
But ultimately, when you look at the fact

01:14:45.565 --> 01:14:47.855
that at the end of that 8 1/2 years,

01:14:47.901 --> 01:14:50.741
when she's already done a year of that,

01:14:50.778 --> 01:14:52.528
she'll be 32 years old.

01:14:52.572 --> 01:14:54.702
She'll be three years younger
than I am right now.

01:14:54.741 --> 01:14:57.451
So, I mean, she will actually be able

01:14:57.493 --> 01:15:01.333
to enjoy just the world.

01:15:03.124 --> 01:15:05.714
Do you think 10 years in jail is better

01:15:05.752 --> 01:15:08.712
than 10 years of living the
way that you had to live?

01:15:08.755 --> 01:15:12.045
Yes, it is.

01:15:12.091 --> 01:15:15.931
I need to start over like I'm newly born.

01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:35.990
- Honey?
- Yeah.

01:15:36.032 --> 01:15:37.242
- Green?
- Yeah.

01:15:37.283 --> 01:15:39.493
White or green?

01:15:39.535 --> 01:15:41.325
No, no, no, no, no.

01:15:41.371 --> 01:15:42.661
It's my favorite hat.

01:15:42.705 --> 01:15:44.115
No, other hat.

01:15:48.086 --> 01:15:51.166
I'm holding on to that girl.

01:15:51.214 --> 01:15:53.424
You know, it's going to be very emotional.

01:15:53.466 --> 01:15:55.416
Yeah, you're a big crybaby.

01:15:55.468 --> 01:15:56.570
You're probably gonna cry, too.

01:15:56.594 --> 01:15:57.894
And then when you're gonna cry,

01:15:57.929 --> 01:15:59.799
I'm going to cry

01:15:59.847 --> 01:16:01.467
because you're crying,

01:16:01.516 --> 01:16:03.676
because it's hard to see grown men cry.

01:16:06.854 --> 01:16:08.274
I don't cry.

01:16:08.314 --> 01:16:09.484
Bullshit.

01:16:11.818 --> 01:16:13.318
You cry.

01:16:26.624 --> 01:16:29.084
- Hello.
- Daddy.

01:16:29.127 --> 01:16:31.497
Oh...

01:16:35.008 --> 01:16:36.548
I've missed you.

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:44.720
- You're so big.
- I know!

01:16:44.767 --> 01:16:46.727
I'm almost as tall as you.

01:16:52.442 --> 01:16:54.572
So how's everything going
with you health-wise?

01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:56.338
- You good? You feel good?
- It's going good, yeah.

01:16:56.362 --> 01:16:57.840
You've been exercising and everything?

01:16:57.864 --> 01:17:00.414
I've been going to the rec
yard, been exercising.

01:17:00.450 --> 01:17:02.490
That's good.

01:17:02.535 --> 01:17:04.405
My tube site is finally all healed.

01:17:04.454 --> 01:17:05.834
It's gone? That's good.

01:17:05.872 --> 01:17:07.752
Looks great. Looks good.

01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:10.460
All healed up, so...

01:17:10.501 --> 01:17:12.381
Every once in a while, I get a little pain,

01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:14.800
but I think it's just
phantom pain or something.

01:17:14.839 --> 01:17:15.959
Yeah.

01:17:17.091 --> 01:17:19.011
So, are you glad that it's...

01:17:19.052 --> 01:17:20.592
I'm happy that it's over.

01:17:20.636 --> 01:17:25.556
Yeah. We was... honestly,
we was hoping for less.

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:29.100
I mean, I know it was your
decision and everything.

01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:31.725
- That's a gamble you take. I mean...
- Yeah.

01:17:31.773 --> 01:17:33.903
I look at it like you
could've got 30 years.

01:17:33.941 --> 01:17:38.191
I look at it that I could've
got life in prison, you know?

01:17:38.237 --> 01:17:42.107
I was hitting a really down point,

01:17:42.158 --> 01:17:45.528
and it was before...
Before the plea agreement,

01:17:45.578 --> 01:17:49.038
before I knew anything about it.

01:17:49.082 --> 01:17:52.922
I was thinking if I get life in prison

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:55.960
and that is what I get,

01:17:56.005 --> 01:17:58.835
I'm committing suicide right now, you know?

01:17:58.883 --> 01:18:01.303
I was seriously considering it.

01:18:01.344 --> 01:18:03.625
- Well, baby...
- 'Cause I'm like, it could just be over.

01:18:04.639 --> 01:18:07.099
I just want to make sure you know that

01:18:07.141 --> 01:18:09.771
if I had done anything
wrong, I'm sorry, baby.

01:18:09.811 --> 01:18:11.601
No, I don't think you did anything wrong.

01:18:11.646 --> 01:18:15.396
I think it's just Mom was very
good at what she was doing,

01:18:15.441 --> 01:18:18.821
and I think you just was
completely in the dark.

01:18:18.861 --> 01:18:20.611
And I don't... I want you to know

01:18:20.655 --> 01:18:25.235
I don't blame you for any
of it, either of you.

01:18:25.284 --> 01:18:27.954
- Thank you.
- I take blame on myself.

01:18:27.995 --> 01:18:31.705
And I blame other people, but
I never once blamed y'all.

01:18:31.749 --> 01:18:34.709
Don't blame yourself, sweetie.

01:18:34.752 --> 01:18:38.632
We blame... I hold enough
for myself, you know?

01:18:38.673 --> 01:18:40.593
Accountability, it's...

01:18:40.633 --> 01:18:42.683
But, I mean, we're not gonna dwell on that.

01:18:42.718 --> 01:18:44.178
- No.
- No.

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:46.300
We're gonna go forward,
and when you get out..

01:18:46.347 --> 01:18:48.597
- We'll heal together.
- ...you're still gonna be young.

01:18:48.641 --> 01:18:52.311
We can have a great relationship.

01:18:52.353 --> 01:18:55.353
Look, God pulled you through it.

01:18:55.398 --> 01:18:58.318
- Yeah.
- You know?

01:18:58.359 --> 01:19:01.569
The devil don't got you, baby. God got you.

01:19:01.612 --> 01:19:04.032
- Yeah.
- And we got you.

01:19:08.703 --> 01:19:09.873
Give me a hug.

01:19:13.166 --> 01:19:14.416
Hang in there, baby.

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:17.920
You need anything, call any time, okay?

01:19:17.962 --> 01:19:19.502
Oh, she knows.

01:19:19.547 --> 01:19:22.877
We'll come see you again
over there, wherever.

01:19:22.925 --> 01:19:25.085
Just hang tight. Stay strong.

01:19:25.136 --> 01:19:27.546
- We love you.
- I love you, too.

01:19:30.766 --> 01:19:32.676
I don't want to go.

01:19:40.234 --> 01:19:42.944
I don't want to go. I don't want to go.

01:19:49.535 --> 01:19:53.155
It's okay, baby. You can do it, okay?

01:19:53.206 --> 01:19:55.916
Just stay strong.

01:19:55.958 --> 01:19:58.708
You got this far, okay?

01:19:58.753 --> 01:20:00.213
The rest is gonna be easier.

01:20:00.254 --> 01:20:02.384
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay?

01:20:05.218 --> 01:20:06.878
You guys have a safe trip back.

01:20:06.928 --> 01:20:08.638
- Don't get in no trouble.
- I won't.

01:20:08.679 --> 01:20:10.009
- Be good.
- I'll be a good girl.

01:20:10.056 --> 01:20:12.346
- Follow the rules.
- I will.

01:20:12.391 --> 01:20:13.681
Bye.

01:20:13.726 --> 01:20:16.096
- Set a good example.
- I will.
