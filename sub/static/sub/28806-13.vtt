01:38.598 --> 01:40.266
<i>I'm supposed to fix this.</i>

01:42.852 --> 01:44.020
<i>Fix everything.</i>

01:47.941 --> 01:49.150
<i>It's my job.</i>

01:53.655 --> 01:55.532
<i>No wonder people just look the other way.</i>

01:56.074 --> 01:57.826
Let's go! Coming through.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.871
<i>I want to look away, too.</i>

02:03.081 --> 02:04.415
<i>That's all I want.</i>

02:13.800 --> 02:17.053
Tell her that I won't say anything
and that I'm nothing like him.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.138
Ms. Hogarth.

02:19.430 --> 02:22.100
Officer Sanchez is ready
to take your statement.

02:30.191 --> 02:31.192
I know.

02:32.569 --> 02:33.945
Then do something.

03:00.638 --> 03:02.891
Jessica Jones, P.I.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.977
Luke Cage, Hero of Harlem.

03:06.060 --> 03:07.061
Nah.

03:07.604 --> 03:08.855
Just here as a friend.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.401
Nice fashion upgrade.

03:14.485 --> 03:15.987
Uh, new line of work.

03:17.697 --> 03:19.073
I hear you got trouble.

03:19.699 --> 03:21.034
I always have trouble.

03:23.077 --> 03:24.996
Never seen you at my doorstep before.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.290
You've never been in the news so much.

03:27.373 --> 03:29.709
Every day, 50-50 I see your face...

03:30.460 --> 03:31.836
or your friend.

03:55.151 --> 03:56.236
Want a drink?

03:58.655 --> 03:59.656
So...

04:00.323 --> 04:01.323
talk to me.

04:03.910 --> 04:04.910
I can't.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.454
You used to.

04:07.038 --> 04:08.915
Still the same guy under these clothes.

04:08.998 --> 04:11.000
I'd be hurting someone I care about.

04:14.379 --> 04:15.463
Again.

04:16.755 --> 04:19.384
Must be a mighty big love
you got for this somebody, huh?

04:24.264 --> 04:27.141
My somebody was my brother, Willis.

04:29.227 --> 04:30.520
He started with nothing.

04:31.521 --> 04:34.107
But he always found a way to lose more.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.526
He deserved better.

04:37.694 --> 04:39.445
But those lives he ruined...

04:40.530 --> 04:41.531
that was on him.

04:43.992 --> 04:45.326
You sent him to prison.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.203
Worse.

04:48.037 --> 04:49.455
I sent him to the Raft.

04:51.040 --> 04:52.458
Killed me to do it.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.585
But it was the right thing to do.

04:56.462 --> 04:58.381
And you're sure about that?

04:59.465 --> 05:01.718
Enough to show up here
and tell you that it was.

05:03.469 --> 05:05.763
Doesn't mean it won't follow
me around wherever I go.

05:06.347 --> 05:07.724
But he made a decision.

05:09.017 --> 05:10.727
And forced me to make one, too.

05:12.270 --> 05:17.400
The only decision I'm qualified to make
is... bourbon or more bourbon.

05:17.483 --> 05:18.818
Bullshit.

05:19.485 --> 05:20.611
In fact...

05:21.738 --> 05:23.031
if I ever go too far...

05:24.198 --> 05:27.452
I hope that someone
gives enough of a shit about me

05:27.535 --> 05:28.870
to take me down.

05:30.288 --> 05:31.873
Is that a risk these days?

05:33.750 --> 05:35.168
Going too far?

05:36.669 --> 05:38.338
Some would say it's inevitable.

05:41.924 --> 05:43.676
This thing you gotta do...

05:44.552 --> 05:45.553
it's hard.

05:46.471 --> 05:47.472
Real hard.

05:48.514 --> 05:50.350
Wish I could say otherwise.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.227
But I trust you, Jessica Jones.

05:54.604 --> 05:56.356
That's saying something these days.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.070
Hey.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.157
You got shit to do.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.262
<i>Hey. You okay?</i>

07:09.345 --> 07:10.638
I need a ride.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.311
Trish, it's me.

07:18.479 --> 07:19.897
I'm letting myself in.

07:29.740 --> 07:31.409
Are you just sitting here in the dark?

07:32.952 --> 07:34.412
It isn't dark for me.

07:49.886 --> 07:51.262
So, how'd it feel?

07:53.055 --> 07:54.056
Horrible.

07:56.809 --> 07:58.728
- And necessary.
- Necessary?

07:59.645 --> 08:01.898
He was in police custody,
about to be locked up.

08:01.981 --> 08:03.399
- For how long?
- For life.

08:06.986 --> 08:10.239
I'm sorry for what this might mean for us.

08:14.785 --> 08:16.120
I have to change.

08:16.954 --> 08:19.373
We're debuting
our spring-summer collection.

08:19.457 --> 08:20.541
You're going to work?

08:20.625 --> 08:23.002
My cover is more important now than ever.

08:23.085 --> 08:25.671
Why? Because you brutally wiped a man
off the face of the earth?

08:26.547 --> 08:28.799
Look, if you don't like my methods, fine.

08:29.550 --> 08:33.011
But I know there is part of you
that is relieved he's gone.

08:33.095 --> 08:34.304
Not if it was you that did it.

08:34.388 --> 08:37.308
Then who was gonna protect
the people that he could hurt?

08:37.390 --> 08:39.769
You made it perfectly clear
it wasn't gonna be you.

08:40.937 --> 08:43.272
You've forgotten
what it's like to feel afraid.

08:45.525 --> 08:46.776
The rest of us haven't.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.905
I have never been more afraid
than I am right now.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.494
Because I need you to turn yourself in.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.080
What?

09:03.584 --> 09:08.089
You have just gone to unthinkable lengths
to keep me out of jail.

09:08.172 --> 09:09.252
But you were willing to go.

09:09.298 --> 09:11.133
That was before I knew
what I was capable of.

09:11.217 --> 09:14.345
I do now, and I can't do it behind bars.

09:17.139 --> 09:18.558
I used to know who you were.

09:21.769 --> 09:22.853
Who's next?

09:24.522 --> 09:26.649
What if it's someone who's redeemable?

09:27.608 --> 09:29.902
What if it's someone
who's flat-out innocent?

09:29.986 --> 09:32.822
You can't know.
And you can't stop yourself.

09:32.905 --> 09:34.657
I will stop when it's right.

09:35.283 --> 09:38.869
You have no control over it.
I have seen this before.

09:38.953 --> 09:42.164
I know who I am. It's you who can't see.

09:42.748 --> 09:43.749
But I can.

09:51.507 --> 09:52.675
This is bullshit.

09:53.634 --> 09:54.927
It's the truth.

09:56.470 --> 09:58.556
And you know that better than anyone.

10:01.350 --> 10:03.269
Don't, don't. Don't!

10:23.039 --> 10:25.875
Well, I mean...
The guy is a liar and a cheat.

10:25.958 --> 10:28.044
It's probably his own guilt
that gives him headaches.

10:29.712 --> 10:30.796
It's over, Trish.

10:37.553 --> 10:39.388
I guess I have no choice, do I?

10:48.564 --> 10:49.564
Can I...

10:49.732 --> 10:51.942
Can I at least go and clean myself up?

11:07.792 --> 11:08.793
Thank you.

11:13.005 --> 11:14.632
I'm just gonna...

11:16.300 --> 11:18.386
...self-medicate.

11:57.591 --> 11:59.677
You don't understand yet.

12:00.928 --> 12:04.557
But if you stay out of my way,
you'll see...

12:06.392 --> 12:07.601
I'll show you...

12:09.311 --> 12:11.021
Prove to you... Shit.

12:30.916 --> 12:33.076
<i>Police are asking the public
for information</i>

12:33.127 --> 12:35.463
<i>leading to the identity
of the masked killer.</i>

12:35.546 --> 12:39.592
<i>She's been linked to the deaths
of three men whom she deemed criminals.</i>

12:39.675 --> 12:42.011
<i>The question is, who's next?</i>

12:54.982 --> 12:58.110
I'm sorry. I, uh...
was gonna call you about Demetri.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.404
Are you all right? I saw the news.

13:01.405 --> 13:03.032
You're not here about the lawsuit?

13:03.115 --> 13:05.367
You said Demetri would back down, so...

13:13.834 --> 13:17.505
Oh, my God, you're shaking.
You must have been terrified.

13:18.130 --> 13:19.215
Whoa!

13:19.715 --> 13:21.217
- I got it.
- It's fine.

13:22.468 --> 13:24.136
I got it.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.222
- You're upset.
- I'm fine.

13:27.389 --> 13:31.560
You can barely stand upright, Jeri.
This is too much. You're...

13:31.644 --> 13:32.645
Dying.

13:36.273 --> 13:40.736
I am terrified, yes.
But I'm shaking, uh, because I have ALS.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.156
And I found you again...

13:46.700 --> 13:48.285
because I'm going to die.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.377
How long do you have?

13:57.253 --> 13:58.838
It's progressing slowly.

14:02.091 --> 14:05.010
My hands, they're not, um, mine anymore.

14:05.094 --> 14:08.639
And eventually my entire body
will become a prison.

14:12.643 --> 14:15.020
It was selfish of me to seek you out.

14:15.855 --> 14:20.109
I can see that now. I'm...
I am genuinely sorry.

14:22.778 --> 14:25.406
- I've already, um...
- Been through this. I know.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.701
- Let me...
- I don't want anything from you.

14:28.784 --> 14:31.954
But you've helped me so much.
You know, the financials, the lawsuit...

14:32.037 --> 14:34.957
Let me just take care of this.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.211
Hello.

14:39.295 --> 14:43.007
<i>You and I have a secret.
I'd like it to stay that way.</i>

14:43.090 --> 14:45.050
It will.

14:45.134 --> 14:47.011
<i>That favor you asked of me...</i>

14:47.094 --> 14:50.472
You know, forget about it.
I'm gonna... go another way.

14:50.556 --> 14:54.101
You said Demetri Patseras
was a bad person. How bad?

14:55.019 --> 14:57.938
I just... I just wanted
proof of tax evasion.

14:58.022 --> 15:00.441
<i>- But he's done worse?</i>
- Demetri?

15:00.524 --> 15:01.984
I can make it right.

15:03.277 --> 15:05.070
It's the only reason I'm here.

15:06.739 --> 15:10.159
When you protect a bad person,
that makes you a bad person.

15:10.242 --> 15:12.119
<i>The kind I'm trying to stop.</i>

15:12.828 --> 15:14.038
Is he dropping the suit?

15:14.121 --> 15:17.917
Answer the question, Jeri.
How bad is Demetri Patseras?

15:21.962 --> 15:23.213
He's a monster.

15:29.970 --> 15:31.221
Trish has to be stopped.

15:33.641 --> 15:34.683
I'm going after her.

15:35.351 --> 15:36.352
Good.

15:38.020 --> 15:41.315
Have you tried tracking
her cell phone, her car GPS?

15:41.398 --> 15:43.108
Credit card statement would be too easy.

15:43.192 --> 15:45.778
She emptied a bank account.
Cash withdrawal.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.323
- Have you ID'd her to the cops yet?
- No.

15:49.406 --> 15:51.283
They could help if they know who she is.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.869
Then the public knows,
and out come the pitchforks.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.245
They'll chase her out of town.

15:56.372 --> 15:58.457
And we need her here
where we can catch her.

16:00.084 --> 16:02.044
What makes you think
she hasn't already left town?

16:03.629 --> 16:05.965
Because she still has to prove me wrong.

16:07.716 --> 16:09.093
'Cause if I'm right...

16:10.678 --> 16:14.723
that means she's become the exact thing
that she hates the most.

16:15.557 --> 16:16.557
Please!

16:17.267 --> 16:18.978
No!

16:21.981 --> 16:23.065
Say it.

16:25.859 --> 16:28.237
Say it! Admit it!

16:28.320 --> 16:31.824
I admit it. I cheated taxes.

16:31.907 --> 16:33.158
What else, Demetri?

16:36.620 --> 16:39.665
I... I hit my wife. But I got help.

16:40.624 --> 16:42.876
- Daddy!
- Stay back, Nora!

16:45.004 --> 16:46.255
You were supposed to be alone.

16:47.047 --> 16:48.257
I called 911.

16:48.340 --> 16:51.927
Don't hurt her.
Please, don't hurt my daughter.

16:53.387 --> 16:55.556
I w... I wouldn't. I...

16:57.891 --> 16:58.892
I wouldn't.

17:09.278 --> 17:13.115
<i>Demetri Patseras, a wealthy
financier, is in critical condition</i>

17:13.198 --> 17:16.160
<i>after suffering a brutal attack
in his Upper East Side home.</i>

17:16.242 --> 17:19.079
<i>Patseras' 12-year-old daughter
witnessed the attack,</i>

17:19.163 --> 17:22.583
<i>and has identified the attacker
as the masked vigilante...</i>

17:22.665 --> 17:23.666
Jesus, Trish.

17:23.751 --> 17:25.127
<i>...a recent wave of killings.</i>

17:25.711 --> 17:27.378
I hope he was goddamn evil.

17:27.921 --> 17:29.441
There's a good chance of it.

17:30.132 --> 17:31.008
Do you know him?

17:31.091 --> 17:33.802
I know somebody who does.

17:35.471 --> 17:36.871
You sent her to kill him.

17:37.431 --> 17:40.309
- Back away.
- Oh, I'm the least of your worries.

17:40.851 --> 17:43.562
She's fine. You can leave.

17:46.648 --> 17:48.484
You think they'll protect you from her?

17:53.906 --> 17:55.157
Why are you here?

17:56.116 --> 17:59.244
Demetri Patseras. You gave him to her.

18:00.329 --> 18:03.332
- I didn't ask her to hurt him.
- But you knew she would.

18:03.415 --> 18:06.543
She needed a new target.
Better Patseras than me.

18:07.377 --> 18:10.130
I've seen what she's capable of,
up close and personal.

18:10.214 --> 18:13.092
Your clients are exactly
the kind of people Trish is after.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.219
- You're her supplier now.
- No.

18:15.302 --> 18:16.887
You think you'll have a choice?

18:19.431 --> 18:22.059
Okay, so you're... you're here for what?

18:22.142 --> 18:25.813
To rub my nose
in the shit that is my life?

18:25.896 --> 18:26.897
Have at it.

18:28.857 --> 18:32.069
- I need you to help me bring her in.
- How?

18:33.737 --> 18:36.031
Every trap needs bait.

18:38.450 --> 18:42.788
Oh, you think because I'm dying anyway
that I would put myself in harm's way?

18:44.206 --> 18:46.792
I thought because you're dying anyway

18:47.626 --> 18:50.712
that you'd want to atone
for the shit that is your life.

19:03.725 --> 19:05.018
I ordered Thai.

19:07.104 --> 19:08.313
Works for me.

19:08.730 --> 19:09.773
Hmm.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.444
Oh, I gotta pee.

19:15.362 --> 19:18.407
If it comes, my treat.

19:22.744 --> 19:25.164
- Yes.
- Coming.

19:36.466 --> 19:37.301
Uh, Zaya.

19:37.384 --> 19:39.720
Sorry. I just came
to get the rest of my things.

19:39.803 --> 19:40.846
I left you messages.

19:40.929 --> 19:43.765
- I... I was gonna return your calls.
- Were you?

19:44.766 --> 19:45.767
I don't know.

19:47.603 --> 19:48.604
Here.

19:51.648 --> 19:55.777
I came for more than
just underwear and an old toothbrush.

19:57.237 --> 19:59.615
Unless a little closure
is too much to hope for.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.450
You should go.

20:03.785 --> 20:05.120
Yeah, sure.

20:05.787 --> 20:06.787
I love you.

20:11.793 --> 20:13.629
But I sabotaged it.

20:15.672 --> 20:16.673
Why?

20:17.424 --> 20:18.425
I don't know.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.345
I sure as shit gotta figure it out.

20:22.095 --> 20:23.680
Gotta figure a lot of things out.

20:24.556 --> 20:25.682
With me?

20:25.766 --> 20:30.270
Did they bring chili sauce?
I like to drown my damn noodles in it.

20:31.647 --> 20:34.066
Shit. Hey.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.986
It's just an arrangement, um...

20:38.946 --> 20:40.530
He's a good guy.

20:50.666 --> 20:52.209
You fooled another one.

20:57.881 --> 20:59.601
- That'll be $3.50.
- Keep the change.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.675
<i>Now we go live
for some breaking news.</i>

21:01.718 --> 21:02.552
<i>Ms. Hogarth!</i>

21:02.636 --> 21:05.240
<i>Ms. Hogarth, sources tell us
you can identify the masked vigilante.</i>

21:05.264 --> 21:06.783
<i>Anybody claim
the quarter million?</i>

21:06.807 --> 21:08.850
<i>You still championing
your deceased client?</i>

21:08.934 --> 21:10.534
<i>Know who killed Gregory Sallinger?</i>

21:10.560 --> 21:13.397
<i>Thanks to the first-rate team
at Hogarth & Associates,</i>

21:13.480 --> 21:15.148
<i>yes, we have discovered her identity.</i>

21:15.732 --> 21:18.527
<i>This is not the appropriate forum
to release her name.</i>

21:18.610 --> 21:20.362
<i>Now, this woman, however,</i>

21:20.445 --> 21:23.156
<i>she is far too dangerous
to leave out on the streets.</i>

21:23.740 --> 21:25.701
<i>I expect an arrest will be imminent.</i>

21:25.784 --> 21:28.537
<i>There you have it,
folks. We'll keep you informed as...</i>

21:55.939 --> 21:56.940
Shit.

22:00.027 --> 22:02.654
Hey. This isn't a good time.

22:02.738 --> 22:06.283
Demetri Patseras is in the hospital
in critical condition.

22:06.366 --> 22:09.369
- Yeah, I... I heard.
- Did you send her? That woman?

22:09.453 --> 22:10.370
Okay, okay.

22:10.454 --> 22:12.640
- Can we talk about this another time?
- His lawyer called

22:12.664 --> 22:14.434
- and said he's dropping the lawsuit.
- Kith...

22:14.458 --> 22:18.378
No, and I should be horrified,
afraid, angry...

22:18.462 --> 22:23.550
But it's over, and all I feel... is free.

22:29.931 --> 22:32.017
- You're welcome.
- Oh, my God!

22:32.100 --> 22:33.477
All right. Okay, okay.

22:34.644 --> 22:36.355
We had an understanding.

22:36.438 --> 22:39.566
I don't give a shit what you do
or who you kill...

22:40.734 --> 22:44.071
but, please, just stay away from us.

22:44.154 --> 22:46.323
You've unleashed a lot of evil
in this world.

22:46.865 --> 22:48.075
No!

22:54.539 --> 22:57.918
That escape out your bathroom window was
a freebie. Try it again and you'll pay.

22:58.543 --> 23:00.087
I am not your problem anymore.

23:00.170 --> 23:01.880
You will always be my problem.

23:02.506 --> 23:03.715
Make the call.

23:05.384 --> 23:08.095
You're not fast enough.
And you can't beat me.

23:09.471 --> 23:10.471
Not in the light.

23:11.598 --> 23:13.266
This is it, Trish.

23:13.350 --> 23:15.143
I need to report a break-in.

23:15.811 --> 23:17.396
The masked vigilante is in my house.

23:18.188 --> 23:19.189
No!

23:20.399 --> 23:22.609
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting out of here.

23:23.110 --> 23:26.696
Don't. I will do anything that you ask.

23:27.572 --> 23:30.033
- Please.
- Trish, look at yourself. This isn't you.

23:30.117 --> 23:33.370
I don't want to hurt her,
but I will if I have to.

23:33.453 --> 23:34.955
You already are.

23:35.038 --> 23:39.668
So just let her go, and you and I
can talk or fight or whatever.

23:39.751 --> 23:41.253
Let her go!

23:43.171 --> 23:45.799
- Drop the gun.
- I won't let her hurt you.

23:45.882 --> 23:49.428
No, you're just gonna shoot her yourself.
Or are you a goddamn marksman now?

23:49.511 --> 23:50.512
Back off.

23:56.226 --> 23:57.394
You're right.

23:58.437 --> 24:01.064
I represent all sorts of criminals.

24:01.648 --> 24:04.443
Some who are in a hurry
to leave the country.

24:04.526 --> 24:05.861
Who do you think they turn to?

24:05.944 --> 24:07.529
No, she's not going anywhere.

24:07.612 --> 24:09.030
You heard her.

24:10.282 --> 24:13.034
She's not gonna stop
till she takes you in.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.080
New York isn't safe for you anymore.

24:18.790 --> 24:22.169
Leave her, take me,
and I will get you out.

24:28.550 --> 24:29.551
Take me! Go!

24:43.190 --> 24:45.192
No, no, I understand the risks.

24:45.734 --> 24:47.527
Okay, I will meet you at your price

24:47.611 --> 24:50.822
if and only if you can get it to me
within 24 hours.

24:52.365 --> 24:53.405
Call here when it's ready.

24:55.076 --> 24:56.661
He'll expedite the passport.

24:57.579 --> 25:00.874
I'll take you across the border to Canada.
Then you're on your own.

25:02.792 --> 25:04.586
He'll need a photo of the new me.

25:12.093 --> 25:13.220
Extra protection.

25:13.303 --> 25:14.596
You don't seem to need it.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.767
Your powers are impressive.

25:19.434 --> 25:21.269
It doesn't matter
how powerful I am.

25:21.353 --> 25:23.730
I'll never forget
what it's like to be helpless.

25:24.856 --> 25:25.941
I know the feeling.

25:29.945 --> 25:31.154
Are you gonna kill me?

25:32.781 --> 25:34.908
I don't want to kill anyone.

25:35.450 --> 25:36.785
Well, I don't want to die.

25:38.495 --> 25:40.705
Yet you gave your life for someone else's.

25:41.206 --> 25:42.958
That's unexpected coming from you.

25:44.042 --> 25:45.043
I love her.

25:47.754 --> 25:50.757
I want more for her than I do for myself.

25:51.591 --> 25:52.842
Congratulations.

25:53.468 --> 25:54.803
Jessica feels that way for you.

25:56.179 --> 25:57.847
She wants her sister back.

25:58.848 --> 26:00.058
Well, so do I.

26:00.600 --> 26:03.645
But she doesn't understand what I'm doing,
because she can't do it.

26:04.521 --> 26:07.315
- She can't make the ultimate sacrifice.
- Which is?

26:10.026 --> 26:11.027
Everything.

26:14.781 --> 26:16.825
They're probably calling for that photo.

26:27.877 --> 26:31.923
<i>The masked vigilante
has killed three people. Bad people.</i>

26:32.841 --> 26:36.803
Maybe you're glad they're gone.
Maybe you're even rooting for her.

26:37.220 --> 26:40.307
But that's not heroic, it's murder.

26:41.099 --> 26:45.145
<i>She won't go down without a fight,
but she needs to go down.</i>

26:48.898 --> 26:51.651
So I'm asking you to help me find her.

26:53.445 --> 26:54.821
Her name is Trish Walker.

26:54.904 --> 26:56.364
No. Shit!

26:56.448 --> 26:59.826
- <i>You may know her as Patsy.</i>
- She can't do this.

26:59.909 --> 27:01.036
<i>She's on the run.</i>

27:01.119 --> 27:04.289
She's holding her attorney,
Jeryn Hogarth, hostage.

27:04.372 --> 27:06.958
<i>She's dangerous. Do not approach her.</i>

27:07.667 --> 27:11.046
Don't try to be a hero. It's a shitty job.

27:17.636 --> 27:20.156
- <i>Fourteen, 10-10 call.
- Copy that.</i>

27:21.473 --> 27:23.016
<i>Suspect residence is vacant.</i>

27:23.099 --> 27:25.852
<i>Repeat, the Walker residence
is uninhabited.</i>

27:25.935 --> 27:28.188
Jesus.
We're getting a shitload of traffic.

27:30.190 --> 27:31.441
You've gone viral.

27:31.524 --> 27:33.318
That was the objective.

27:37.072 --> 27:38.990
I'm gonna have to do this one straight.

27:40.116 --> 27:41.956
Is that even safe?

27:45.789 --> 27:47.624
You'll find her, but you gotta fight her.

27:48.875 --> 27:50.460
And one of us will win.

27:52.212 --> 27:53.755
What can I do to help?

27:54.798 --> 27:58.551
Hop on social media and search
through the "Find Patsy" hashtags.

28:12.440 --> 28:13.817
We are beyond passports

28:13.900 --> 28:16.277
and anything resembling
legitimate transport.

28:16.361 --> 28:17.987
Jessica made sure of that.

28:18.071 --> 28:20.115
I've never done business with this man.

28:20.740 --> 28:22.909
None of my clients
have ever been that desperate.

28:24.577 --> 28:26.371
- You trying to scare me?
- No, I just...

28:27.831 --> 28:30.583
I like being sure
of the people that I deal with.

28:33.128 --> 28:34.587
Do you trust his greed?

28:35.714 --> 28:38.216
Because he only gets paid
if I get there safely, right?

28:38.800 --> 28:40.844
I could negotiate
the terms of your surrender.

28:40.927 --> 28:41.928
No.

28:42.011 --> 28:44.264
This option is extreme.

28:44.347 --> 28:45.807
So is the alternative.

28:48.017 --> 28:50.395
- Jeryn Hogarth. You must be...
- This the client?

28:53.982 --> 28:56.067
You didn't mention it was Trish Walker.

28:56.151 --> 28:57.652
Well, you get paid either way.

29:03.366 --> 29:05.660
I understand
you're a government contractor.

29:06.244 --> 29:07.620
I supply the armed forces.

29:07.704 --> 29:10.457
It gives me some flexibility
with security restrictions.

29:11.875 --> 29:13.460
Where will you be taking me?

29:13.543 --> 29:17.338
We'll layover in Thailand.
From there you can go wherever you want.

29:19.466 --> 29:22.010
You don't need the wig.
I trust these guys.

29:38.610 --> 29:39.986
You ship coffins.

29:40.069 --> 29:42.739
To war zones. It's a living.

29:48.828 --> 29:50.538
Seventeen hours to Phuket.

29:51.122 --> 29:54.375
But we have something that'll
put you right out, nice and easy.

29:55.418 --> 29:56.461
No drugs.

29:57.337 --> 30:02.091
What, she... She's gonna stay
in that box for the entire flight?

30:02.175 --> 30:04.886
Not all of the flight crew
know about my side project.

30:04.969 --> 30:10.099
But this... is specially modified,
oxygen enabled.

30:10.183 --> 30:13.478
Haven't lost anyone yet.
We take off in two hours.

30:15.980 --> 30:16.980
You still in?

30:25.949 --> 30:28.660
"I haven't seen Trish,
but you should comb your hair."

30:28.743 --> 30:31.162
"Found a moth on a sweater
I bought from her."

30:31.246 --> 30:34.165
"Found her," with a picture
of a Patsy drag queen.

30:34.249 --> 30:37.418
- What is in this drink?
- Hold on. This is something.

30:37.502 --> 30:40.380
Long-haul trucker said
he spotted Trish in a silver Lexus.

30:40.463 --> 30:42.257
Hogarth's car. Where?

30:42.340 --> 30:44.527
East on the Southern Parkway
near Farmingdale.

30:44.551 --> 30:47.387
- There's a... an old airport out there.
- Yep, got it.

30:49.556 --> 30:52.559
Mostly cargo. Let's go.

30:54.102 --> 30:56.312
Keep tracking the online traffic
in case we're wrong.

30:56.855 --> 31:00.942
- Hey, I'll drive you.
- No. This is between me and Trish.

31:01.025 --> 31:02.025
Jess...

31:02.485 --> 31:03.903
I need to be alone with her.

31:49.324 --> 31:52.744
- <i>What?</i>
- Jessica, she's at SAC Imports.

31:52.827 --> 31:54.704
- Where is she?
- You're here.

31:55.788 --> 31:57.749
- Cargo bay.
- Where?

31:57.832 --> 31:59.125
Down there.

31:59.208 --> 32:00.335
Get out of here.

32:08.927 --> 32:11.679
- This is a private facility.
- Where's Trish Walker?

32:11.763 --> 32:14.057
I've got no idea
what you're talking about.

32:14.140 --> 32:16.184
- Where is she?
- In the coffins.

32:22.649 --> 32:23.483
Which one?

32:25.318 --> 32:26.319
Shit.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.840
Why can't you just let me go?

33:31.134 --> 33:35.888
Sallinger, Nussbaumer, Montero...

33:37.098 --> 33:38.933
They won't hurt anyone else.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.059
No, but you will.

33:50.778 --> 33:52.113
What's your plan here?

33:54.240 --> 33:56.034
Who else are you gonna kill?

34:02.373 --> 34:03.458
Am I next?

34:08.254 --> 34:09.630
Go ahead, Trish.

34:11.007 --> 34:12.132
Prove me right.

34:25.938 --> 34:28.983
I thought this was because
of what Sallinger did to you.

34:30.359 --> 34:32.779
Or maybe it was a side effect
of your powers.

34:34.530 --> 34:37.324
But it has been there all along.

34:38.951 --> 34:41.329
I saw it when you shot my mother.

34:42.996 --> 34:45.416
- And I can see it now.
- You're wrong.

34:46.751 --> 34:50.755
It's Dorothy who beat
the self-righteous resolve into you.

34:52.799 --> 34:54.634
You think you're avenging her.

34:56.010 --> 34:57.011
You've become her.

34:57.094 --> 34:58.930
God damn it, stop!

35:01.182 --> 35:02.433
Shit!

35:09.315 --> 35:10.983
You were right about one thing.

35:13.820 --> 35:15.571
I don't have what it takes.

35:19.492 --> 35:20.618
Maybe you do.

36:07.290 --> 36:11.169
They pulled jurisdiction,
so I'll be handing you off to them.

36:11.252 --> 36:14.881
Due process doesn't seem to apply
to enhanced peoples.

36:16.966 --> 36:19.635
We've been told to close
all cases related to you.

36:19.719 --> 36:22.722
Please acknowledge that you understand
the list of charges against you,

36:22.805 --> 36:23.806
for the record.

36:24.974 --> 36:27.810
"Two counts of murder in the first degree.

36:28.936 --> 36:31.898
One count of murder in the second degree.

36:32.732 --> 36:35.276
Multiple counts of aggravated assault,

36:35.359 --> 36:39.447
kidnapping, breaking and entering,
trespassing.

36:40.072 --> 36:41.908
And one count of attempted murder...

36:43.201 --> 36:44.577
against your own sister."

36:47.955 --> 36:49.790
Ms. Walker, do you understand?

36:56.547 --> 36:59.675
Ms. Walker? Ms. Walker, do you understand?

37:04.180 --> 37:05.598
I'm the bad guy.

37:31.415 --> 37:34.001
- I'm glad you're okay.
- I am now.

37:36.045 --> 37:38.923
I wanted to say thank you, Jeri.

37:39.924 --> 37:42.009
And I want
to make love to you.

37:45.638 --> 37:47.390
- What?
- Don't, please.

37:52.645 --> 37:57.275
You sacrificed yourself for me,
and I'm so grateful.

37:58.567 --> 38:00.319
I did that because I love you.

38:04.699 --> 38:06.367
I came to say thank you...

38:08.911 --> 38:10.204
and to say goodbye.

38:12.415 --> 38:13.791
What? You don't believe me?

38:15.668 --> 38:16.711
After what I did?

38:17.336 --> 38:19.422
- I believe you, but...
- "But," what?

38:22.591 --> 38:24.302
For God's sake, what?

38:25.594 --> 38:26.595
You did what you did

38:26.679 --> 38:30.308
because we were both in a dangerous,
insane situation that you created.

38:30.391 --> 38:33.102
I mean, you weren't supposed to be here.
You just showed up.

38:34.562 --> 38:35.938
It wasn't the only sign.

38:36.022 --> 38:40.401
It was just the most... glaring depiction
of who you are.

38:42.028 --> 38:43.029
Well...

38:44.280 --> 38:46.032
that's behind us now. Hmm?

38:46.824 --> 38:48.659
It's behind me, Jeri.

38:49.243 --> 38:53.497
I'm leaving it and... you behind.

38:53.581 --> 38:54.581
You can't.

38:58.919 --> 38:59.920
I need you.

39:02.298 --> 39:03.716
I need you.

39:03.799 --> 39:05.885
I know, you don't want to die alone.

39:11.057 --> 39:12.058
But you're going to.

39:17.396 --> 39:18.397
Kith.

39:23.319 --> 39:25.654
You're the last mistake I will ever make.

39:55.976 --> 39:59.939
I come bearing first aid supplies
and kung pao chicken.

40:00.022 --> 40:02.108
Which one do you want
me to put on your leg?

40:05.736 --> 40:07.279
I also got you...

40:12.201 --> 40:13.327
Yeah, I saw it.

40:14.703 --> 40:15.704
You earned it.

40:19.458 --> 40:20.751
Yeah, I did.

40:21.293 --> 40:26.132
I think it's cool,
having never been mistaken for one myself.

40:27.258 --> 40:28.551
Maybe you will someday.

40:28.634 --> 40:30.719
Nah. Thanks.

40:32.555 --> 40:35.558
It would be nice to help, though.

40:37.601 --> 40:41.897
I mean, it wouldn't suck,
working and being...

40:45.609 --> 40:47.987
Working together.

40:59.039 --> 41:00.458
You're a good man.

41:01.792 --> 41:02.793
I know that.

41:06.797 --> 41:08.215
But I don't trust you.

41:15.431 --> 41:20.686
And coming from you, from... a hero...

41:23.606 --> 41:25.316
that means only one thing.

41:28.444 --> 41:30.613
I gotta do something about that.

43:09.587 --> 43:10.588
Hey.

43:14.508 --> 43:15.634
Don't screw it up.

43:52.004 --> 43:53.004
On the house.

43:54.923 --> 43:55.924
Why?

43:56.550 --> 43:58.594
You look like someone shit in your bed.

44:07.353 --> 44:08.354
Erik Gelden?

44:11.482 --> 44:12.983
We have a mutual friend.

44:15.194 --> 44:16.654
She wanted us to meet.

44:18.947 --> 44:20.366
I'm Detective Costa.

44:24.119 --> 44:26.205
Jessica thought we could help each other.

44:27.790 --> 44:29.041
She did, did she?

44:35.798 --> 44:37.633
Red sweater, on his phone.

44:48.602 --> 44:49.687
What'd he do?

44:49.770 --> 44:52.189
I don't know, but it's bad.

44:56.318 --> 44:57.528
Hey.

44:58.779 --> 44:59.905
Glad to meet you.

45:00.948 --> 45:02.074
Yeah, likewise.

45:20.801 --> 45:22.511
<i>Some things...</i>

45:23.429 --> 45:24.847
<i>you look at...</i>

45:25.639 --> 45:27.057
<i>and you think...</i>

45:28.809 --> 45:29.852
<i>"Disaster."</i>

45:34.231 --> 45:36.567
<i>You search for exits...</i>

45:39.194 --> 45:40.320
<i>escapes.</i>

45:48.537 --> 45:51.540
<i>Other things, you think...</i>

45:52.875 --> 45:54.626
<i>"Maybe I can fix this."</i>

45:58.714 --> 46:00.215
<i>You might ask yourself...</i>

46:03.427 --> 46:06.972
<i>"What's it gonna take
to make it feel right?"</i>

46:11.810 --> 46:15.314
<i>The answer is... "Too much."</i>

46:21.570 --> 46:23.238
<i>It'll take too much.</i>

47:51.869 --> 47:52.869
Where to?

47:53.704 --> 47:55.539
The closest you can get to Mexico.

47:55.831 --> 47:58.709
That'd be El Paso, Texas.

48:01.253 --> 48:02.337
One way.

48:06.341 --> 48:07.341
Here you go.

48:12.931 --> 48:15.601
<i>Jessica...</i>

48:16.852 --> 48:20.063
<i>You're right to give in. Give up.</i>

48:21.148 --> 48:23.233
<i>It's someone else's job now.</i>

48:29.698 --> 48:30.991
El Paso, right?
