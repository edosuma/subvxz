it got me thinking, "Who will
take my place when I'm gone?"

00:50.105 --> 00:53.424
In that spirit, I've
decided to select a protégé.

00:54.643 --> 00:56.594

Yeah, I don't really feel
comfortable asking him.

Sorry?

02:22.147 --> 02:23.447
You're asking to
go on his boat.

02:23.482 --> 02:25.817
No, I just said,
"Good for you."

I'm aroused.

02:52.010 --> 02:53.144
So is she.

02:53.178 --> 02:55.213
Careful, she's a squirter.

Did you guys hear
about the new kid?

03:15.117 --> 03:17.585
Yeah, I heard he likes
to kick people's asses.

03:17.619 --> 03:19.320
I wouldn't talk about
the new kid if I were you.

03:19.354 --> 03:21.589
He just beat up a teacher
for saying his name.

03:21.623 --> 03:22.823
What did you do?

03:22.858 --> 03:23.858
What?

03:23.892 --> 03:25.359
Oh, no, no, no,
that's from home.

03:25.394 --> 03:26.494

03:26.528 --> 03:29.496
Oh. Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

of this new guy, fellas.

it's not written down.

03:56.642 --> 03:58.409
Look at this dill-bag.

Quick, Smith, do that
funny thing I taught you.

04:10.672 --> 04:12.039

just leave me alone

04:12.074 --> 04:13.808

04:13.842 --> 04:15.226
I don't know, Dick.

04:15.260 --> 04:18.696
Maybe because
your name is Dick?

04:20.232 --> 04:21.832
Oh, great.

and his pack of goons.

04:24.903 --> 04:26.237
Who's Agent Crisp?

04:26.271 --> 04:28.005
He's from Internal Affairs.

04:28.040 --> 04:30.074
I've never trusted this guy.

04:30.108 --> 04:32.710
Agent Stan Smith, can I
speak to you in private?

04:42.638 --> 04:44.555
They go this way? Thanks.

04:44.589 --> 04:47.525
My intel shows that you're
Bullock's new protégé,

04:47.559 --> 04:50.661
which is why I'm entrusting
you with a top-secret mission.

04:50.696 --> 04:51.796
Wait, what's going on?

04:51.830 --> 04:55.366
Bullock has recently
showed signs of dementia.

04:55.400 --> 04:56.901
It's protocol
in these situations

04:56.935 --> 04:59.670
to administer a full
cognitive redaction.

04:59.705 --> 05:02.039
Whoa, whoa, you mean
erase his memory?

05:02.074 --> 05:03.808
The way you did with
Deputy Director Milbrook?

05:03.842 --> 05:06.077
It's for the safety
of this country.

05:06.111 --> 05:08.679
And as you can see,
Milbrook is fine.

05:08.714 --> 05:10.214
Look at that smiling face.

05:13.285 --> 05:14.785
There must be a mistake.

05:14.820 --> 05:16.153
There's no way
he's got dementia.

05:16.188 --> 05:18.739
This isn't a request.

05:18.774 --> 05:20.808
Bring Bullock to the old
Lanceton Ice Factory

05:20.842 --> 05:22.209
tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.

05:22.244 --> 05:23.577
That's an order.

05:25.063 --> 05:26.681

05:26.715 --> 05:28.015
The light went out
in the bathroom.

05:28.050 --> 05:29.884
I was so scared.

05:30.902 --> 05:32.236
Roger, I need your help!

05:32.270 --> 05:34.155
There's a big,
crazy guy at school

05:34.189 --> 05:36.490
who wants to beat
the crap out of me.

05:47.636 --> 05:50.805
(breathes deeply)

05:50.839 --> 05:52.206
I'm listening.

05:52.240 --> 05:53.974
We're supposed
to fight Friday at 3:00.

05:54.009 --> 05:56.477
I-I only have two days
to find a way out of it.

05:56.511 --> 05:57.978
I know a guy
who loves a good fight.

05:58.013 --> 06:00.214
I'll give him a call,
he'll take care of your problem.

06:00.248 --> 06:02.216
Oh, thank you.

06:02.250 --> 06:04.051
Wait, the guy's not
going to be you, is he?

06:04.086 --> 06:05.352
No, I promise.

06:05.387 --> 06:08.556
'Cause a lot of times when
you say you "know a guy,"

06:08.590 --> 06:10.558
you're really just
talking about yourself.

06:10.592 --> 06:12.543
Fine, it was going to be me,
but since you're making

06:12.577 --> 06:15.012
a big deal about it,
I'll call somebody else, okay?

06:15.047 --> 06:16.781
Stop figuring out my tricks.

06:16.815 --> 06:18.149
Aah!

06:26.041 --> 06:27.241

06:31.446 --> 06:32.613
(horn beeps)

06:34.049 --> 06:36.784
Hey, this is a nice surprise.

06:39.621 --> 06:42.890
As your protégé, I figured
everything is an opportunity

06:42.924 --> 06:46.143
to learn... or something.

06:46.178 --> 06:48.746
Well, perhaps the first deuce
of wisdom I'll drop on you

06:48.780 --> 06:51.899
is that the CIA
is back the other way.

06:51.933 --> 06:54.685
Actually, I-I was thinking maybe
we could take the scenic route.

06:54.736 --> 06:56.804
A country drive.

06:56.822 --> 06:57.938
In that case, do you mind

06:57.973 --> 06:59.490
if open the window
and have a whistle?

06:59.524 --> 07:00.991
Sure, sir.

07:01.026 --> 07:03.244
Whistle away.

07:03.278 --> 07:05.145
(whistling)

07:07.249 --> 07:09.150
(whistling continues)

07:11.169 --> 07:13.454
That's the longest
I've ever whistled.

07:13.488 --> 07:15.623
That's the longest I've ever
listened to someone whistle.

07:15.657 --> 07:17.491
You know, Stan,
I was going to wait

07:17.509 --> 07:18.959
until lunch to give you this.

07:18.993 --> 07:23.097
I've never let anyone taste
my signature sandwich...

07:23.131 --> 07:24.682
until now.

07:24.716 --> 07:26.801
Oh, sir, I-I'm
not really hungry.

07:26.835 --> 07:28.502
Come on, take a bite.

07:28.520 --> 07:30.688
I made it just for you.

07:33.058 --> 07:34.391
Mmm, mmm.

07:34.442 --> 07:36.477
Oh, man, that's amazing.

07:36.511 --> 07:37.778
I'll text you
the recipe right now.

07:37.813 --> 07:38.979
(phone beeps)

07:44.185 --> 07:47.154
Sir, I just want you to know,

07:47.188 --> 07:49.824
these last few days, you've...

07:49.858 --> 07:51.208
taught me so much.

07:51.243 --> 07:52.576
Please, passing on knowledge

07:52.627 --> 07:54.829
is what keeps me going
at this age.

07:54.863 --> 07:57.798
When I've got nothing
left to teach, I'm done.

07:57.833 --> 08:00.000
Just dress me up,
give me a cigar

08:00.034 --> 08:02.035
and put one in the back
of my head.

08:02.053 --> 08:05.756
Then call my son and tell him
you just killed his Daddy.

08:05.807 --> 08:07.258
He'll know what it means.

08:12.414 --> 08:13.848

08:13.882 --> 08:15.683
Stan, what's going on?

08:17.485 --> 08:19.453

08:19.487 --> 08:21.255

brought you here.

Guys, I'm backing up here.

I'm right here.

08:27.829 --> 08:28.863

08:28.897 --> 08:30.714
I'm looking at it,
bring it back.

08:30.749 --> 08:31.749
You got it.

08:33.501 --> 08:35.285
STAN:
Okay, thanks.

08:40.183 --> 08:42.702
Smith, what is happening?

08:42.822 --> 08:45.051
Crisp said you had
dementia, so they wanted

08:45.104 --> 08:46.504
to retire you and
erase your memory.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.435
Dementia? That's insane.

08:48.469 --> 08:50.437
Wait, Crisp?

08:50.471 --> 08:51.754
That bastard.

08:51.772 --> 08:53.773
He's finally making his move.

08:53.808 --> 08:56.876
What?
He's had it out for me ever since I stumbled

08:56.911 --> 08:59.396
onto a conspiracy
he's involved in.

08:59.430 --> 09:01.197
Conspiracy?
Yes!

09:01.232 --> 09:02.949
He must know I'm close
to finding evidence

09:02.984 --> 09:04.267
that'll expose him.

09:04.285 --> 09:05.869
We have to get a hold
of that evidence.

09:05.903 --> 09:07.871

09:07.905 --> 09:08.955
It's Crisp.
What do I do?

09:08.990 --> 09:11.574
You slide to answer.

but Bullock's fine.

is a scientist,

12:18.829 --> 12:20.430
and, as you may recall,

12:20.464 --> 12:22.999
was instrumental in providing
a cleanup solution
