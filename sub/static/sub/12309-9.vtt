00:04.200 --> 00:09.149
Neuraminidase inhibitor.
Neuraminidase inhibitor.

00:10.120 --> 00:12.111
Neuraminidase inhibitor.

00:16.480 --> 00:17.799
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:18.280 --> 00:19.554
Heard you're going offworld.

00:19.640 --> 00:23.189
I'm assisting with
a medical follow-up on M33-985, yes.

00:23.280 --> 00:25.316
- With Keller.
- Right again.

00:25.400 --> 00:26.435
On your day off.

00:26.520 --> 00:28.636
- What? I can't go offworld in my free time?
- No, no, go ahead.

00:28.720 --> 00:30.312
I just think it's odd
that you're volunteering

00:30.400 --> 00:32.789
for goodwill missions on your day off.

00:32.880 --> 00:33.869
Well, I'm turning over a new leaf.

00:33.960 --> 00:37.396
It's a whole new, you know,
kinder, gentler Rodney McKay.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:49.200 --> 00:51.395
There you are. You all set?

00:53.760 --> 00:55.432
You're coming, too, are you?

00:55.520 --> 00:58.273
Yeah, Ronon offered to help out, too,

00:58.360 --> 01:01.750
so I just thought, you know,
the more the merrier, right?

01:03.920 --> 01:07.993
- Is there a problem?
- No, no, no, just, I was... No, it's nothing.

01:09.040 --> 01:10.109
Okay.

01:10.920 --> 01:12.876
Go ahead and dial, Chuck.

01:13.320 --> 01:16.517
I got this. I'm good, I got it.
I got it. I'm good.

01:17.200 --> 01:21.398
You want it? You take that.
I got my own stuff. I'll bring...

01:26.560 --> 01:28.516
So, the people we're seeing today,

01:28.600 --> 01:31.114
as long as you avoid any physical contact,
you should be fine.

01:31.200 --> 01:33.634
The contagion doesn't
seem to be airborne.

01:33.720 --> 01:34.948
What's wrong with
these people again?

01:35.040 --> 01:38.112
It's a disease similar
to one on Earth called influenza.

01:38.200 --> 01:39.758
It's been spreading throughout the village.

01:39.840 --> 01:43.469
Not too severe a strain,
but enough to put a scare into them.

01:48.840 --> 01:51.957
- He's caught it, too.
- Will he be all right?

01:52.040 --> 01:55.919
His fever's mild, so plenty of rest,
lots of fluids, and he should be fine.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.638
I'm also going to prescribe some medicine.

01:57.720 --> 02:01.508
- A neuraminidase inhibitor?
- Very good.

02:02.800 --> 02:06.634
Can I have a look at you too,
Erran, just to be on the safe side?

02:09.759 --> 02:11.591
Would you guys mind
giving us some privacy?

02:11.680 --> 02:15.639
I think there's a tavern close-by.
Why don't you go get some lunch?

02:17.040 --> 02:18.712
You want to... Sure.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.514
What's the matter? You don't like it?

02:31.120 --> 02:32.473
You know, you don't have to be here.

02:32.560 --> 02:34.596
I'm sure you got plenty of stuff
to do back on Atlantis.

02:34.680 --> 02:37.831
Oddly enough, I don't, actually.
But if you need to get back, then...

02:37.920 --> 02:40.275
- No, I'm good.
- Of course you are.

02:40.360 --> 02:41.429
Mmm-hmm.

02:44.240 --> 02:45.229
You think we've given them enough time?

02:45.320 --> 02:48.756
I don't want to interrupt
if they're in the middle of medical stuff.

02:50.160 --> 02:52.469
Hi, is Dr. Keller done?

02:52.800 --> 02:54.472
She's not with you?

02:54.960 --> 02:56.552
She finished with us, then left,

02:56.640 --> 02:59.438
said she was going to join you
at the tavern.

02:59.840 --> 03:01.796
Right. Very good. Thanks.

03:02.440 --> 03:04.510
- Jennifer?
Jennifer!

03:04.600 --> 03:06.716
Jennifer, it's Rodney, do you read me?

03:06.800 --> 03:09.473
- Jennifer!
- Dr. Keller, please respond.

03:12.280 --> 03:14.350
Well, either her radio isn't working,
or she's turned it off.

03:14.440 --> 03:17.512
- She wouldn't do that.
- Then what happened to her?

04:21.079 --> 04:22.752
- Anything?
- Checked up and down the street.

04:22.840 --> 04:24.478
No one's seen her.
It's like she just vanished.

04:24.560 --> 04:25.913
Doesn't make any sense.
She wouldn't take off

04:26.000 --> 04:27.638
without letting us know
where she's going.

04:29.160 --> 04:30.673
Not unless someone
took her against her will.

04:30.760 --> 04:32.751
Maybe you should go back to the gate,
radio Atlantis for help.

04:32.840 --> 04:36.753
- Maybe you're right.
- I'll stay here and check the entire village.

05:06.240 --> 05:07.593
Who are you?

05:08.160 --> 05:11.470
If you'd stop struggling,
I wouldn't have to stun you.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.831
- What do you want from me?
- And stop asking questions.

05:17.720 --> 05:19.950
I just want to know
why you kidnapped me.

05:20.040 --> 05:23.715
How did you take me from the village?
I don't even remember...

05:27.000 --> 05:28.069
Good.

05:31.160 --> 05:32.388
Let's go.

05:35.840 --> 05:37.751
- McKay?
Yeah, go ahead.

05:37.840 --> 05:39.956
I got some footprints outside the village.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.508
- Jennifer's?
Standard Atlantis tread.

05:42.960 --> 05:45.076
But there's someone with her.

05:45.480 --> 05:47.755
Bigger prints, like my size.

05:47.840 --> 05:50.070
Looks like there was a struggle.

05:50.320 --> 05:51.514
Damn it.

05:52.800 --> 05:55.997
Weird thing is,
it's like they just appeared out of nowhere.

05:56.920 --> 05:58.239
What do you mean, "nowhere"?

05:58.320 --> 06:00.515
I mean there's nothing at all
between here and the village.

06:00.600 --> 06:01.919
Then they just appear,

06:02.000 --> 06:04.309
like they dropped out of the sky.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.315
Wait a sec.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.516
Got a single set of tracks
heading into the woods.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.238
A single set?

06:11.320 --> 06:13.151
Not Keller's, the other guy's.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.559
So what happened to Keller's?

06:17.440 --> 06:21.069
These prints are deeper.
My guess is he's carrying her.

06:22.080 --> 06:24.275
Probably knocked her unconscious, or...

06:25.000 --> 06:26.319
Oh, God.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.118
I'm going to check it out.

06:30.200 --> 06:31.235
McKAY: Maybe we should wait.

06:31.320 --> 06:32.469
All right, I'm almost at the gate.

06:32.560 --> 06:35.870
I'll radio ahead, get a team here,
do a proper search.

06:35.960 --> 06:39.589
That sounds good. You do that.
Meantime, I'm going after her.

06:44.640 --> 06:47.518
McKay?
- Yeah, I'm here.

06:48.280 --> 06:50.475
I got two sets of tracks again.

06:51.520 --> 06:53.112
She's still alive.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.518
Great! That's great!

06:58.240 --> 07:00.515
All right, I'm at the gate.

07:00.800 --> 07:02.756
I'll get the search teams mobilized
and join you shortly.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.594
Oh, crap!

07:40.120 --> 07:42.236
- McKAY ON RADIO: Ronon!
- What?

07:42.520 --> 07:44.476
- We got Wraith!
- How many?

07:44.800 --> 07:47.598
Four of them just came through the gate.
One of them's about to kill me!

08:25.920 --> 08:26.989
Oh, shit!

08:43.760 --> 08:44.988
Finally!

08:45.480 --> 08:48.153
- What took you so long?
- You're welcome.

08:50.960 --> 08:52.712
- It's a hunter.
- What?

08:52.800 --> 08:55.758
- Wraith hunter. They chase runners.
- I thought runners were extremely rare.

08:55.840 --> 08:56.829
Like, only a few in the galaxy.

08:56.920 --> 08:58.558
- That's right.
- So a few years ago, we run into you,

08:58.640 --> 09:00.198
and now another one?
I mean, what are the odds of that?

09:00.320 --> 09:01.958
Where'd the other Wraith go?

09:02.040 --> 09:04.474
I don't know.
They spread out into the forest.

09:04.560 --> 09:06.312
Where are you going?
Where are you going? Hey! Wait!

09:08.360 --> 09:11.033
This is as far as we go on the trail.

09:11.120 --> 09:12.997
Where are you taking me?

09:17.840 --> 09:19.876
At least tell me your name.

09:20.480 --> 09:23.278
There'll be time to talk when we get there.

09:25.040 --> 09:26.189
Where?

09:33.360 --> 09:35.032
What are you doing?

09:40.240 --> 09:41.355
Ronon?

09:46.680 --> 09:47.954
Watch out!

10:09.000 --> 10:11.275
We need to get your people
to a safe place as fast as possible.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.555
- Why? What happened?
- We spotted Wraith in the area.

10:13.640 --> 10:16.154
- Wraith? Coming here?
- Hopefully not. It's just a few of them.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.309
We think they're looking for someone else.

10:17.400 --> 10:18.753
But we don't want to
take any chances.

10:18.840 --> 10:21.479
Look, have you seen anyone different
in the village recently?

10:21.560 --> 10:25.075
Any newcomers, anyone that looks,
I don't know, like that?

10:25.520 --> 10:27.556
- No.
- We don't have time for this.

10:27.640 --> 10:28.834
Is there a place your people can hide?

10:28.920 --> 10:30.751
There are dozens of caverns
surrounding the village.

10:30.840 --> 10:32.432
Our ancestors used them
during the last culling.

10:32.520 --> 10:34.431
Good. Come on, let's go.
- All right.

10:36.200 --> 10:39.397
What is that thing?
- Take too long to explain.

10:39.480 --> 10:42.199
Too long?
We've been walking for hours now.

10:43.120 --> 10:45.554
- Can I at least rest for a bit?
- No.

10:45.920 --> 10:47.876
Just a few minutes?

10:47.960 --> 10:49.757
A few minutes to allow your team
to gain ground on us?

10:49.840 --> 10:51.114
What team?

10:51.600 --> 10:56.116
You're from Atlantis. You're a doctor.
There were two men traveling with you.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.839
Watch your step. Just keep going.

11:12.920 --> 11:15.559
It's just past that gully.
You're almost there.

11:15.640 --> 11:17.915
That's it, that's it. Mind your step, sir.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.356
- Sir?
- Ma'am. Sorry. You have a...

11:21.440 --> 11:23.431
That is clearly a mustache.

11:28.040 --> 11:30.270
That's the last of them.
The village is empty now.

11:30.360 --> 11:33.796
Good. Go with them,
make sure they stay in the caverns.

11:33.880 --> 11:34.915
And keep them quiet.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.672
Make sure no one makes a sound
unless you hear from me.

11:38.240 --> 11:40.595
- Or me.
- All right. Thank you.

11:42.360 --> 11:44.237
Hey, maybe we should
go back to the gate?

11:44.320 --> 11:45.719
No, go ahead.
I'm going to keep tracking Keller.

11:45.800 --> 11:48.109
Well, I do not think it is wise
for us to split up right now.

11:48.200 --> 11:49.189
We have no idea where the Wraith are.

11:49.280 --> 11:51.396
It takes too long to go back.
That runner took her.

11:51.480 --> 11:53.630
We let him get too far ahead,
we'll never find them.

11:53.720 --> 11:56.075
Look, if you want to go to the gate,
go ahead. I'm leaving.

11:56.160 --> 11:57.912
Ronon? Ronon!

11:58.840 --> 12:00.512
Damn it! Would you just... Ronon!

12:05.720 --> 12:06.869
Oh, no.

12:10.760 --> 12:12.716
You done trying to escape?

12:14.440 --> 12:17.637
More Wraith close-by.
We need to keep moving.

12:21.760 --> 12:24.274
You're not from the village, are you?

12:24.720 --> 12:26.870
I've never noticed you,
and I pretty much met everyone.

12:26.960 --> 12:29.110
Are you even from this planet?

12:30.840 --> 12:32.034
You're the one
who brought the Wraith here.

12:32.120 --> 12:37.478
- They're after you. Why?
- I'm a runner. You know about runners?

12:38.480 --> 12:41.153
One of the men I'm traveling with,
he used to be one.

12:41.240 --> 12:45.028
Used to be? That's impossible.
Runners don't stop being runners.

12:45.120 --> 12:47.918
- Yeah, well, this one did.
- Yeah? Well, how?

12:49.480 --> 12:51.869
Take me to him, and we'll tell you.

12:52.880 --> 12:54.154
I promise.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.755
Look, we don't have to be enemies.

13:00.520 --> 13:01.714
Nice try.

13:05.440 --> 13:06.919
Hey! If you...

13:08.000 --> 13:08.989
What?

13:09.080 --> 13:11.514
This is where Keller's tracks
start up again.

13:11.600 --> 13:15.149
Look, smaller, shallower, Atlantis tread.

13:15.960 --> 13:18.394
These prints are bigger and deeper.

13:19.400 --> 13:22.278
- The runner.
- Keller's tracks are uneven.

13:22.360 --> 13:25.079
She's either hurt or bound, probably both.

13:26.320 --> 13:28.834
Well, at least the tracks are clear, though.
Easier to follow, right?

13:28.920 --> 13:31.753
That's the problem.
No runner is that stupid.

13:36.680 --> 13:38.398
It's going to be dark soon.

13:38.480 --> 13:42.314
McKAY: Actually, we have two hours,
43 minutes and 17 seconds.

13:42.400 --> 13:45.358
This planet's sun currently has
a very gradual angle of descent

13:45.440 --> 13:46.759
and a very short night.

13:46.840 --> 13:49.149
I always make it a point
to download the planetary data

13:49.240 --> 13:51.879
on every address I dial,
even goodwill missions.

13:51.960 --> 13:53.951
You know, things like
atmospheric conditions,

13:54.040 --> 13:56.508
soil consistencies,
available water supplies...

13:56.600 --> 13:57.635
What?

13:58.000 --> 13:59.399
Just wondering
how long you'd make it out here

13:59.480 --> 14:01.755
- without your little gadgets.
- You know, I think you'd be surprised.

14:01.840 --> 14:05.833
I mean, I may not be exactly
what you'd call an "outdoors person,"

14:05.920 --> 14:06.909
but that doesn't mean I don't find

14:08.280 --> 14:09.269
the whole man-versus-nature thing
uninteresting.

14:09.360 --> 14:12.477
Hell, I joined a scouting organization
when I was a child.

14:12.600 --> 14:14.875
Lodge 14
of the Fort McMurray Eager Beavers.

14:14.960 --> 14:17.633
Beavers?
- Yeah, large rodent, big teeth.

14:17.720 --> 14:21.110
They use them to chop down trees
and build dams, very industrious.

14:21.200 --> 14:23.316
I was with them for a few months
before they asked me to leave,

14:23.400 --> 14:28.679
but I got the manual. Still have it.
Scouting for Beavers, invaluable resource.

14:28.760 --> 14:32.958
So, I think you'll find, in a pinch,
I handle myself very well, thank you very...

14:33.040 --> 14:34.792
- What is it?
- Blood.

14:35.400 --> 14:37.834
- Oh, my God.
- No, it's Wraith blood.

14:39.560 --> 14:40.879
Here we go.

14:42.120 --> 14:44.031
Someone was sitting here.

14:46.440 --> 14:49.876
Look, single set of tracks.

14:51.560 --> 14:53.551
But they left the trail, going that way.

14:53.640 --> 14:55.915
McKAY: Are you sure?
'Cause the footprints keep going this way.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.399
Single set.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.710
Yeah, I know,
but maybe he's carrying her again.

14:59.800 --> 15:03.429
Or maybe they were attacked
by the Wraith, Jennifer was stunned,

15:03.520 --> 15:06.717
and then the runner kills the Wraith
and disposes of the body,

15:06.800 --> 15:09.519
and then carries Jennifer on up the trail.

15:10.440 --> 15:13.796
Look how deep these tracks are.
I say we follow these.

15:15.720 --> 15:17.039
Easy.

15:43.760 --> 15:46.320
Like I said, no runner is that stupid.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.831
- What now?
- We go up.

15:54.480 --> 15:58.473
- Up? How? Do you have a rope?
- No need for ropes.

16:04.160 --> 16:05.593
Did we just...

16:07.080 --> 16:08.752
How did we do that?

16:10.240 --> 16:13.232
I was on a planet a while back,
lots of technology.

16:13.320 --> 16:15.390
Got this from one of the locals.

16:15.480 --> 16:18.199
Barely put it on my arm
before it fused to my skin.

16:18.280 --> 16:20.396
Since then,
if I hit this light when it's green,

16:20.480 --> 16:23.358
I can disappear,
move around from place to place.

16:23.440 --> 16:26.955
Teleportation, that's how
you got me out of the village so fast.

16:27.040 --> 16:28.871
I can only go short distances.

16:28.960 --> 16:32.748
It needs time to recharge between jumps,
especially when I take someone with me.

16:32.840 --> 16:34.910
But it's helped me
stay ahead of the Wraith.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.399
I imagine so.

16:39.520 --> 16:40.635
McKay!

16:42.200 --> 16:43.349
Damn it.

16:58.120 --> 17:01.351
- What the hell are you doing?
- At the moment? Killing Wraith!

17:01.440 --> 17:03.510
What are you stopping for?

17:03.600 --> 17:06.512
- I had a stone in my boot, I told you.
- No, you didn't.

17:06.599 --> 17:08.636
Yes, I did!
I said, "Wait up, I got a stone in my boot. "

17:08.720 --> 17:11.598
Every second you lag behind makes it
that much harder for me to track this guy.

17:11.680 --> 17:14.035
- Especially at night.
- Not anymore.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.679
We don't have to play man tracker now.

17:16.760 --> 17:19.718
We're going to know exactly
where this guy is,

17:22.200 --> 17:24.236
thanks to this handy gadget.

17:24.839 --> 17:28.549
Look at that signal.
They're even farther away than I thought.

17:32.880 --> 17:34.233
McKAY: I'm sorry,
but I guarantee you, at some point,

17:34.320 --> 17:36.550
you're going to need my help. You'll see.

17:36.640 --> 17:39.029
There'll be some problem you can't solve,
then you'll turn to me,

17:39.120 --> 17:42.032
I'll figure it out in the nick of time.
You'll say, "Good job,"

17:42.120 --> 17:44.634
or just grunt or slap me on the back
harder than necessary.

17:44.720 --> 17:47.188
Anyways, the point is,
we both have our gifts.

17:47.280 --> 17:49.271
So you need to stop
resenting my presence here

17:49.360 --> 17:51.510
and start realizing
we're on the same team,

17:51.600 --> 17:54.398
both trying to achieve
the same goal, all right?

17:54.480 --> 17:56.277
You listening?
Look, you've got the tracker face.

17:56.360 --> 17:57.349
Can you hear what I'm saying here?

17:58.240 --> 18:00.629
When are you going to tell me
what you want from me?

18:00.720 --> 18:02.756
I need you to help someone.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.991
- Who?
- That's not important to you.

18:05.080 --> 18:07.275
You just need to give her
medical attention.

18:07.360 --> 18:09.920
Her? Who is she, your wife?

18:11.080 --> 18:13.833
When we get there,
I won't be able to stay with you.

18:13.920 --> 18:16.229
The longer I'm in one place,
the greater the danger.

18:17.280 --> 18:18.952
Probably a dozen more Wraith on the way.

18:19.400 --> 18:20.879
Trail ends here.

18:20.960 --> 18:22.757
McKAY: Well, he's dead ahead.

18:22.840 --> 18:25.957
So either he climbed this thing,
or he figured out how to get around it.

18:26.040 --> 18:27.075
No sign they went around.

18:27.160 --> 18:30.072
Well, so they must've had
a rope or something, unlike us.

18:30.160 --> 18:31.912
Look, how are we going to get up there?

18:32.000 --> 18:33.433
You said something
about solving a problem?

18:33.520 --> 18:36.478
Yeah, technological problems,
not rock-climbing problems.

18:36.560 --> 18:37.834
Thought so.

18:40.640 --> 18:43.996
Have you ever thought about
trying to remove that tracking device?

18:44.080 --> 18:47.675
You could say that.
I had a few doctors try. No luck.

18:48.640 --> 18:51.074
I have advanced medical
technology with me.

18:51.160 --> 18:54.118
- I know.
- So I could probably remove it.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.269
That runner I was telling you about?

18:55.360 --> 18:57.271
One of our doctors
removed his tracking device.

18:57.360 --> 18:58.998
That's how he was able
to stop being a runner.

18:59.080 --> 19:01.833
You have something in here
that can remove it?

19:01.920 --> 19:03.478
I have a scanner.

19:03.720 --> 19:07.190
With that, I can pinpoint
the location of your tracking device,

19:07.280 --> 19:11.239
give you some anesthetic,
make a quick incision, you're free of it.

19:11.880 --> 19:14.394
Look, you say there's someone
who needs medical attention?

19:14.480 --> 19:16.118
It's going to be a lot safer for all of us

19:16.200 --> 19:19.670
if we throw the Wraith
off your trail before we get there.

19:36.880 --> 19:37.915
Okay.

19:40.040 --> 19:41.314
Turn around.

19:41.400 --> 19:44.073
- If you try anything...
- Just turn around.

19:53.840 --> 19:55.319
Do you see it?

20:00.360 --> 20:01.918
What did you see?

20:04.080 --> 20:07.550
Your tracking device, it's different.

20:08.920 --> 20:10.911
It's much more complicated.

20:11.440 --> 20:13.954
It's branched out,
fused not only to your spine,

20:14.040 --> 20:16.076
but also to your brain stem.

20:19.120 --> 20:21.111
Removing it would kill you.

20:26.080 --> 20:27.354
I'm sorry.

20:29.160 --> 20:30.957
We need to get moving.

20:42.440 --> 20:46.877
McKAY: Okay. Nightfall,
17 minutes, but like I said, it's very brief.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.309
Like Whitehorse in June.

20:49.880 --> 20:51.677
Not that you have any idea
what Whitehorse is,

20:51.760 --> 20:53.273
or June, for that matter.

20:54.480 --> 20:55.799
What the...

20:59.560 --> 21:01.915
Holy crap! Did you see that thing?

21:06.160 --> 21:08.799
- This guy is good.
- This guy's a killer.

21:13.680 --> 21:15.591
Good. No one found it.

21:15.680 --> 21:16.954
Found what?

21:29.600 --> 21:31.556
Her name is Celise.

21:32.000 --> 21:36.312
- What happened to her?
- She fell, injured her leg.

21:38.560 --> 21:41.233
I did my best to clean the wound,
but...

21:42.000 --> 21:45.913
- It's infected. When did this happen?
- A few days ago.

21:47.360 --> 21:49.271
When she got worse,
I went looking for a doctor.

21:49.360 --> 21:50.634
We went to three different planets.

21:50.720 --> 21:52.517
I heard there were people from Atlantis

21:52.600 --> 21:54.238
helping the village here
with their sickness.

21:54.320 --> 21:58.359
So I brought her here,
found this cave to hide her,

21:58.440 --> 22:01.750
set a few traps to keep the Wraith
or anyone else away,

22:02.200 --> 22:04.430
then waited for you to show up.

22:04.640 --> 22:06.835
You know,
you could've just asked for my help

22:06.920 --> 22:10.310
- instead of kidnapping me.
- I couldn't take that chance.

22:10.960 --> 22:14.111
Most people don't want
anything to do with runners.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.599
- Is she your daughter?
- No.

22:21.280 --> 22:24.716
She lived in a village
that was destroyed by the Wraith.

22:25.800 --> 22:27.472
Let me guess,
you brought the Wraith there?

22:27.560 --> 22:31.712
I stayed there one night.
I didn't think they'd find me that fast.

22:32.800 --> 22:35.268
They culled the whole village.

22:35.680 --> 22:38.353
Celise was the only person I could save.

22:41.720 --> 22:44.154
- How bad is she?
- Very bad.

22:45.640 --> 22:48.950
Her blood pressure's dangerously low.
She's septic, going into shock.

22:49.040 --> 22:50.075
What does that mean?

22:50.160 --> 22:54.392
It means the wound is necrotic.
I'm going to have to surgically debride it,

22:54.480 --> 22:56.391
cut away the dead tissue.

22:56.640 --> 22:59.552
I'm going to start her on an IV antibiotic,

22:59.640 --> 23:03.235
but she needs much stronger medications
than I have with me.

23:04.080 --> 23:06.196
She's a very, very sick girl.

23:06.840 --> 23:09.912
She can't die. You cannot let her die.

23:12.320 --> 23:13.958
I'll do what I can.

23:16.280 --> 23:17.838
I'll be close-by.

23:41.600 --> 23:44.512
It's okay. It's okay. I'm here to help you.

23:46.960 --> 23:48.393
I gave you some medicine
to numb your leg.

23:48.480 --> 23:50.232
Do you feel any pain?

23:53.080 --> 23:55.594
Good. That's good.

23:56.800 --> 23:58.233
Where's Kiryk?

23:59.280 --> 24:01.999
"Kiryk. " So that's his name.

24:03.320 --> 24:07.108
He's just outside, keeping watch,
making sure you're safe. Okay?

24:10.880 --> 24:15.112
- That's a beautiful doll.
- Kiryk made it for me.

24:17.280 --> 24:20.431
Mean old Kiryk, huh? Go figure.

24:21.120 --> 24:22.997
He's not mean. He just pretends to be.

24:28.920 --> 24:31.036
I know someone just like him.

24:32.960 --> 24:34.552
McKAY: The signal's circling.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.995
Wherever he's taking her,
I think they've arrived.

24:37.080 --> 24:38.308
How long before daybreak?

24:38.400 --> 24:41.631
McKAY: Not long now,
maybe under an hour. It's pretty short.

24:44.080 --> 24:45.513
What are you doing? Shoot it!

24:51.520 --> 24:52.839
Don't move.

25:04.800 --> 25:08.713
- One less trap to worry about.
- Is that supposed to be comforting?

25:19.160 --> 25:20.593
You scared me.

25:21.600 --> 25:23.192
How is she?

25:23.280 --> 25:26.113
I debrided the wound,
cleaned it as best I could,

25:26.240 --> 25:29.232
but she's not out of danger,
not by a long shot.

25:30.120 --> 25:32.634
She needs a much stronger
antibiotic regimen,

25:32.720 --> 25:35.678
not to mention
the probability of a skin graft.

25:36.480 --> 25:38.789
I'd like to take her to Atlantis.

25:39.040 --> 25:41.998
Our infirmary can provide her
with the proper care she needs.

25:42.080 --> 25:44.310
- I can't go to Atlantis.
- I know.

25:45.200 --> 25:48.158
You're going to have to trust me
with her care.

25:51.600 --> 25:54.068
As long as you return her to me
when she's healed.

25:54.160 --> 25:56.151
Kiryk, you have to understand something.

25:56.240 --> 25:57.992
There's no guarantee
she's going to survive this.

25:58.080 --> 25:59.877
She's still very sick.

26:00.400 --> 26:02.197
But if she survives,

26:03.360 --> 26:07.797
being constantly hunted by the Wraith
is no life for a child. You know that.

26:08.080 --> 26:11.550
If you really want her to live,
you need to let her go.

26:14.200 --> 26:16.236
If I knew that she would...

26:17.480 --> 26:18.799
What is it?

26:57.400 --> 26:58.833
Kiryk?

27:44.000 --> 27:45.433
What happened?

27:46.320 --> 27:49.676
The Wraith stunned you,
almost killed Celise.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.991
I couldn't revive you.
They must've hit you with a triple dose

27:53.080 --> 27:55.389
of whatever is in those stunners.

27:55.680 --> 27:57.238
Anyway, I knew we had to get away
from the cave,

27:57.320 --> 28:00.517
so I carried Celise here,
and then I went back

28:01.280 --> 28:05.592
and literally dragged you the distance.
Not an easy task, let me tell you.

28:06.560 --> 28:09.677
- How is she?
- Stable for the time being,

28:10.880 --> 28:12.438
but her fever is still very high.

28:12.520 --> 28:16.115
The longer she stays on this planet,
the greater the danger.

28:19.800 --> 28:22.075
I'll carry her. We'll head back for the gate.

28:22.160 --> 28:25.197
With the Wraith closing in on us?
How far do you think we're going to get?

28:25.280 --> 28:28.477
A lot farther than you
trying to carry her yourself.

28:29.240 --> 28:31.800
Okay, look, I've been thinking.

28:31.880 --> 28:34.394
I may not be able to
remove the tracking device,

28:34.480 --> 28:36.994
but there might be a way to disable it.

28:38.560 --> 28:40.869
This machine is called a defibrillator.

28:41.640 --> 28:43.358
It creates a powerful electric shock

28:43.440 --> 28:44.953
to restore someone's heart
to the proper rhythm,

28:45.760 --> 28:48.320
and I think if I can place the paddles

28:48.400 --> 28:51.119
on the skin directly above
your tracking device,

28:51.200 --> 28:55.398
I might be able to overload
the power source, fry the circuits.

28:57.080 --> 28:59.548
- All right, do it.
- Okay, but you should know

28:59.640 --> 29:02.757
that there's no guarantees
that this is going to work,

29:02.840 --> 29:05.195
and it also carries a lot of risk.

29:05.880 --> 29:07.836
Well, if it works,
the device will be disabled.

29:07.920 --> 29:10.275
If it kills me, same thing.

29:11.280 --> 29:14.113
The Wraith won't be able
to track me anymore.

29:16.920 --> 29:18.876
It's time to stop running.

29:21.480 --> 29:23.436
It's not too much further.

29:27.400 --> 29:30.551
Promise me
you'll make sure she's cared for.

29:30.760 --> 29:32.034
I promise.

29:44.600 --> 29:45.635
Okay.

29:47.120 --> 29:49.634
The charge moves
from one paddle to the other,

29:49.720 --> 29:53.759
and your tracking device is going
to be directly between them. Okay?

29:59.200 --> 30:00.474
All right.

30:08.480 --> 30:09.595
Ready?

30:13.520 --> 30:14.919
Okay, here we go.

30:18.840 --> 30:20.239
What the hell?

30:20.560 --> 30:21.913
- What?
- I don't know.

30:22.000 --> 30:26.232
It just suddenly stopped transmitting.
We lost them.

30:31.920 --> 30:33.512
Come on. Come on.

30:44.840 --> 30:46.068
You okay?

30:47.200 --> 30:48.758
What happened?

30:48.840 --> 30:52.799
I lost you for a moment,
but you're back in the land of the living.

30:53.960 --> 30:55.359
Did it work?

30:59.120 --> 31:00.394
I think so.

31:01.160 --> 31:06.029
The device isn't transmitting any signals.
I think we successfully fried the sucker.

31:07.520 --> 31:09.317
- Oh, no.
- What?

31:09.880 --> 31:14.112
I guess it fried that, too.
- Doesn't matter. Don't need it anymore.

31:14.200 --> 31:18.637
Actually, I know someone who would love
to inspect a gadget like that.

31:23.800 --> 31:24.994
Anything?

31:26.040 --> 31:27.109
What?

31:27.960 --> 31:30.235
A body was dragged through here.

31:41.640 --> 31:43.596
- You got something?
- Yeah.

31:43.960 --> 31:47.794
Two bodies laid here.
Ground cover's trampled in two spots.

31:47.880 --> 31:49.757
So the Wraith got to them before we did?

31:49.840 --> 31:52.593
I don't think so. I don't see
any Wraith footprints anywhere.

31:52.680 --> 31:55.797
Well, so what happened?
What? They killed each other?

31:55.880 --> 31:59.350
No one's dead. At least they weren't
when they were here.

31:59.440 --> 32:02.591
Look, one body was dragged
through here by Keller, her footprints.

32:02.680 --> 32:05.592
So she killed him, probably in the process
of disabling his tracking device.

32:05.680 --> 32:08.478
No, she didn't kill him.
He was unconscious.

32:08.840 --> 32:12.230
His footprints, side by side with hers,
leaving the clearing that way.

32:12.320 --> 32:13.912
So, what, she brought him here
unconscious, revived him,

32:14.000 --> 32:16.036
- and they left together?
- Looks like it.

32:16.120 --> 32:17.314
Hey, wait a second.
You said there were two bodies.

32:17.400 --> 32:20.153
- So, what, she took a nap?
- No, too small for Keller.

32:20.240 --> 32:23.596
My guess is someone else is with them,
probably a child.

32:24.560 --> 32:29.350
- But no footprints?
- No, she was carried here.

32:29.440 --> 32:32.477
She? How could you possibly
know the kid was a...

32:33.720 --> 32:34.789
Oh.

32:41.920 --> 32:42.909
Darts.

32:43.320 --> 32:46.471
Looks like we're not the only ones
who noticed his signal died.

32:50.160 --> 32:53.152
Could sure use
that teleportation device now.

32:53.240 --> 32:55.959
There's a path down not too far from here.

32:56.240 --> 32:59.391
Stay here.
I'll check to make sure it's still safe.

33:12.240 --> 33:14.800
- Ronon! Ronon, wait!
- Jennifer!

33:14.880 --> 33:16.836
- Make him stop!
- What? Why?

33:21.600 --> 33:23.318
Ronon, please, stop!

33:23.560 --> 33:25.596
- Help me. Grab her.
- Okay.

33:28.520 --> 33:29.635
Stop!

33:31.600 --> 33:33.955
Listen, he just wanted me
to help the little girl.

33:34.040 --> 33:35.712
She's sick!

33:35.800 --> 33:38.109
She's dying.
We need to get her back to Atlantis.

33:38.200 --> 33:40.919
Ronon, please.

33:48.560 --> 33:51.552
- McKAY: Jennifer, the...
- Her sutures have torn.

33:51.640 --> 33:54.552
I need to re-stitch her
before we can move her.

34:00.200 --> 34:03.158
- You got Wraith looking for you.
- I know.

34:03.760 --> 34:05.352
Listen, you stand a better chance

34:05.440 --> 34:06.555
fighting them together
than fighting each other.

34:06.640 --> 34:09.632
I mean, obviously the odds of actually
winning are still ridiculously low, but...

34:09.719 --> 34:12.757
- Not helping.
- I'm going to go. Let me get the...

34:14.800 --> 34:18.395
He's right. This place is
going to be swarming with Wraith.

34:18.679 --> 34:21.148
It's better off if we work together.

34:34.920 --> 34:37.275
- All right, she's ready.
- Let's go.

34:43.159 --> 34:44.309
Wraith!

34:46.960 --> 34:48.154
McKAY: Oh, crap.

34:50.159 --> 34:51.275
Ronon!

35:03.240 --> 35:04.958
- Shoot him!
- I will!

35:28.200 --> 35:30.714
Where'd you learn to fight like that?

35:31.880 --> 35:34.269
Been taking a few sparring lessons.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.035
Oh.

35:39.200 --> 35:40.713
We need to move.

35:41.800 --> 35:45.076
I tried to stabilize her,
but she needs stronger medication.

35:45.160 --> 35:46.912
McKAY: You know,
you could've just asked for her assistance

35:47.000 --> 35:48.035
as opposed to kidnapping her.

35:48.120 --> 35:50.509
He knows, Rodney.
Here, I got you something.

35:50.600 --> 35:52.591
It's a kind of teleportation device.

35:52.680 --> 35:56.593
- Teleportation? Really?
- Well, it was, anyway. I kind of broke it.

35:59.800 --> 36:01.233
Is she family?

36:02.360 --> 36:05.432
I brought the Wraith to her village.
She's the sole survivor.

36:07.080 --> 36:09.355
It's not easy, living with that.

36:12.520 --> 36:16.149
Don't worry. We're going to get you
out of this, both of you.

36:35.800 --> 36:37.074
I count six Wraith on the ground.

36:37.160 --> 36:39.720
Six that we can see,
probably more in the surrounding woods.

36:39.800 --> 36:42.837
Want to make a run for it,
shoot our way through?

36:43.080 --> 36:45.548
The ships will be alerted
as soon as the shooting starts.

36:45.640 --> 36:47.392
We'll be culled before we can even dial.

36:47.480 --> 36:49.072
Just going to have to
take our chances.

36:49.160 --> 36:51.628
- Hey!
- You fixed it.

36:51.720 --> 36:52.755
I don't know about "fixed,"
more of a patch.

36:52.840 --> 36:55.354
It's incredibly complicated technology.
I'm not sure if it'll actually...

36:55.440 --> 36:57.510
Hey! What are you doing?

36:58.280 --> 37:00.635
I'm going to improve our chances.

37:04.680 --> 37:06.910
Don't go down there by yourself.

37:07.200 --> 37:09.873
I'll be fine.
Get ready to attack that clearing.

37:09.960 --> 37:11.757
Look, just wait a second, all right?

37:11.840 --> 37:12.875
Look, I'm not sure if I've actually fixed it.

37:12.960 --> 37:13.949
You'll need to test it before you...

37:20.240 --> 37:21.958
I guess I did fix it.

37:31.800 --> 37:34.109
- He's at the gate!
- Stay with them.

37:54.520 --> 37:56.317
He's dialing the gate.

38:34.760 --> 38:36.273
We've got to get a move on.

38:36.360 --> 38:38.794
All right, well, we'll take her to the gate,
then I'll go back,

38:38.880 --> 38:41.792
tell people it's safe to return to the village.

38:53.880 --> 38:58.158
No, no, as they fly up, you want to use
that button there to shoot them.

38:58.960 --> 39:00.518
Shoot the ducks?

39:00.680 --> 39:03.752
They're not real ducks, obviously.
They're just, you know, to pretend...

39:03.840 --> 39:05.671
Maybe you should show her
a different game.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.512
Yeah. Yeah, sure. Here.

39:07.600 --> 39:12.196
- Well, how's our little patient?
- Much better. She's a heck of a fighter.

39:12.640 --> 39:16.349
Is he bothering you?
Because I can have him removed, forcibly.

39:16.600 --> 39:18.795
- Really?
- Yeah, he's kidding.

39:18.880 --> 39:22.953
I talked to one of the families on 985,
the woman's home we visited?

39:23.040 --> 39:24.837
She'd love to have Celise
come and live with them.

39:24.920 --> 39:26.319
That's great.

39:26.400 --> 39:28.197
Will I see Kiryk again?

39:31.040 --> 39:32.393
I don't know, sweetheart.

39:32.480 --> 39:35.995
We're still looking for him,
keeping our eyes and ears open.

39:36.080 --> 39:40.073
Hey, I brought you something.
I think you dropped this in the woods.

39:41.840 --> 39:43.034
My doll.

39:59.440 --> 40:00.873
- What?
- Okay.

40:02.000 --> 40:06.118
Here's the thing. I've been thinking,
and I need to know your intentions.

40:07.320 --> 40:09.356
- Intentions?
- With Jennifer?

40:10.880 --> 40:12.916
I don't have any intentions.

40:13.000 --> 40:13.989
Oh.

40:14.840 --> 40:15.909
Okay.

40:16.880 --> 40:18.279
- Good.
- Wait.

40:21.200 --> 40:23.395
What do you mean by "intentions"?

40:23.480 --> 40:27.553
I mean, are you interested in her
in a romantic fashion?

40:29.840 --> 40:31.432
- No.
- Good.

40:32.560 --> 40:33.595
Wait.

40:34.480 --> 40:35.515
What?

40:37.840 --> 40:40.195
Maybe I do have intentions.

40:42.480 --> 40:43.595
Do you have intentions?

40:43.680 --> 40:45.716
Yes, well, of course I do.
That's why I was asking you.

40:45.800 --> 40:49.031
- So what are we going to do about it?
- I don't know.

40:49.120 --> 40:51.236
I'm not going to fight you for her,
if that's what you're thinking.

40:51.320 --> 40:54.118
- Great!
- I'm not going to step aside, either.

40:54.520 --> 40:57.398
So we're just going
to have to let her decide.

40:58.240 --> 40:59.275
Okay.

41:00.040 --> 41:01.075
Okay.

41:04.720 --> 41:06.870
So may the best man win.
