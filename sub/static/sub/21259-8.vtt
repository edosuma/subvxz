found female remains in Kiribati

00:11.412 --> 00:13.414

died a castaway.

steal your phone

leave work early

have to be a hot rocker.

seven missed calls
from Dottie's school,

21:03.330 --> 21:06.899
and...a text
from Hazel.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.701
Hi, Mom. I'm sorry,

21:08.735 --> 21:10.036
I know it was wrong
to get the phone.

21:10.069 --> 21:12.505
I'll take it back.

21:12.539 --> 21:13.873
- Ready to go home now?

21:13.906 --> 21:16.343
- Definitely.

21:16.376 --> 21:18.378
- Ow.

21:18.411 --> 21:20.913
[gasps and laughs]

21:20.947 --> 21:23.450
- When did that happen?

21:23.483 --> 21:24.417
- For more Odd Mom Out,
