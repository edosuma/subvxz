WEBVTT

03:15.278 --> 03:15.946
Okay, guys.

03:16.238 --> 03:16.780
This is it.

03:17.072 --> 03:18.257
Reggie, you're
our tank as usual.

03:18.281 --> 03:19.401
Hold firm with that defense.

03:19.658 --> 03:20.738
Liz, let's try to mix it up

03:20.909 --> 03:23.078
and open with a celestial
light wave aura spell.

03:23.370 --> 03:24.079
Let's rock!

03:24.371 --> 03:25.747
Come on, Max!

03:26.039 --> 03:26.623
That's weak!

03:26.915 --> 03:27.915
Go big or go home.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.876
How 'bout the doomslayer
force vortex spell

03:30.168 --> 03:31.253
followed by an XP kicker?

03:31.545 --> 03:32.671
Ooh, I like that.

03:32.963 --> 03:33.981
That could be
exactly what we need

03:34.005 --> 03:35.024
to defeat the Nether Kraken.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.067
Right, I think the kicker

03:36.091 --> 03:37.777
could help replenish
our vitals enough to...

03:37.801 --> 03:39.361
- No, you can't just
use the doomslayer

03:39.594 --> 03:40.594
right outta the gate.

03:40.846 --> 03:41.989
You're gonna waste
all your manna.

03:42.013 --> 03:44.391
Hey, Reggie, if you do a
brimstone blockade first,

03:44.683 --> 03:46.163
and then I volley
from behind you...

03:46.435 --> 03:47.102
Heck yeah, Liz!

03:47.394 --> 03:48.103
That could work, totally.

03:48.395 --> 03:48.937
Screw it!

03:49.229 --> 03:51.029
No time for noob
strategery in a ranked quest.

03:51.314 --> 03:52.733
I'm goin' full metal Jenkins.

03:53.024 --> 03:54.664
- No, dude, not again!
- Max, you ass-hat!

03:54.860 --> 03:55.444
Wait!

03:55.736 --> 03:57.696
You're throwing a rock
into a hornets' nest, Max.

03:57.988 --> 03:59.906
- Dude, I know
you're like elite AF,

04:00.198 --> 04:01.926
but you cannot take on
the nether horde solo.

04:01.950 --> 04:02.950
It's a party map, dude.

04:03.160 --> 04:03.744
Teamwork.

04:04.035 --> 04:05.328
- Barbarian attack!

04:05.620 --> 04:06.872
Sir Maximus...

04:07.164 --> 04:08.331
Jenkins!

04:17.757 --> 04:18.757
Reg...

04:18.884 --> 04:20.677
Let's save his dumb ass again.

04:20.969 --> 04:22.512
Lock and load, me lady.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.097
Me lady?

04:24.389 --> 04:25.015
Sorry.

04:25.307 --> 04:26.667
- Bob and weave,
ladies and gents.

04:26.725 --> 04:28.518
Max Reload is doin' the dance.

04:28.810 --> 04:29.810
- Defense, Max!

04:29.853 --> 04:32.093
And dude, stop referring to
yourself in the third person.

04:32.314 --> 04:33.732
It's gross.

04:34.858 --> 04:35.400
- Yo.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.819
We're lookin' to test out
the new Rockstar Revolution.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.271
- Uh, yeah, it's in the back.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.448
Follow your dreams.

04:41.740 --> 04:43.180
- Hey, you break
shit, you buy shit!

04:43.450 --> 04:44.659
- I am the shit!

04:44.951 --> 04:46.591
- Hey, focus on the
mission here, people!

04:46.870 --> 04:48.455
I think we might
have this one on lock.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.749
- Guys, our health
is way too low.

05:14.773 --> 05:15.773
I think we gotta retreat.

05:15.857 --> 05:16.857
- Sack up, Reggie!

05:17.067 --> 05:18.276
Hold firm with that defense.

05:18.568 --> 05:19.568
Liz, take the rear.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.297
You're too soft to
handle the rough stuff.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.321
Let me handle this.

05:22.364 --> 05:24.032
- Oh, excuse you, macho man!

05:24.324 --> 05:26.034
My elven armor will hold.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.206
Okay, wait, guys,
we have to regroup.

05:28.495 --> 05:29.663
- Trust the master.

05:35.210 --> 05:36.210
Dammit!

05:37.420 --> 05:40.340
I had that.

05:54.563 --> 05:55.563
- Teamwork!

05:56.648 --> 05:58.275
Did you just mute us?

05:58.567 --> 06:00.402
We waited a week
to try this quest again!

06:00.694 --> 06:02.237
-That is...

06:02.529 --> 06:03.989
disappointing, dude.

06:08.285 --> 06:09.494
- Oh, no, no, no!

06:09.786 --> 06:10.786
Not him again!

06:10.912 --> 06:13.540
This wizard dude spawn
camper de-cloaks every time

06:13.832 --> 06:14.832
after all our hard work!

06:15.083 --> 06:15.792
He's gonna jack our loot!

06:16.084 --> 06:16.626
Watch!

06:16.918 --> 06:19.880
Doomslayer force
vortex, I summon thee.

06:22.632 --> 06:23.632
Yass, bitch!

06:26.720 --> 06:28.471
- Get a life, ya dick!

06:28.763 --> 06:30.640
I will take this, and this.

06:30.932 --> 06:32.851
Oh and this.

06:33.143 --> 06:34.871
Don't really need this,
but I'll take it anyway.

06:34.895 --> 06:35.437
Love it, love it.

06:35.729 --> 06:36.729
- Unbelievable, Max!

06:36.855 --> 06:38.975
If we'd worked together,
we'd have the power gauntlet,

06:39.190 --> 06:42.777
the luma battleax, and the
doubly yamma cannons right now!

06:45.822 --> 06:47.574
Hey, rock stars,
free sample's up.

06:48.950 --> 06:50.785
- Ah, don't be so salty, Liz.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.805
Look, we all know that
I'm really the only one

06:52.829 --> 06:54.682
who could've made it
through that dungeon alive.

06:54.706 --> 06:57.083
And, hey, at least
my ranking didn't drop.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.836
- Dude, you wouldn't even
have that rank without us.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.463
Not a chance solo!

07:01.755 --> 07:03.840
- As a matter of fact,
maybe I should have.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.092
Yeah, I can defeat
the forces of the Nether

07:06.384 --> 07:08.845
any day of the week,
and I'd slay for days!

07:09.137 --> 07:09.763
You know why?

07:10.055 --> 07:10.639
- I'm listening.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.116
Do not encourage, him, Reggie!

07:12.140 --> 07:15.018
- Because I guarantee that I,

07:15.310 --> 07:17.729
Maximus the
barbarian of Middletown,

07:18.021 --> 07:20.482
one of the top-ranked of the
realm of thy Northern Americas,

07:20.774 --> 07:22.692
could defeat the evil
forces of the Nether

07:22.984 --> 07:26.571
any day of the week,
in the fight for the ages!

07:26.863 --> 07:27.863
That's why.

07:34.371 --> 07:35.455
Yo, did you see that?

07:35.747 --> 07:36.947
- Upgrade your internet, dork.

07:37.123 --> 07:38.923
You're guaranteed to
be looking for a new team

07:39.000 --> 07:40.669
and a new job if
you're late again.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.601
- Chuck's starting
his 48-hour VR-cation,

07:42.837 --> 07:44.398
and if you're late,
he's gonna be pissed.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.800
Not like virtually
pissed, like...

07:47.092 --> 07:48.259
pissed in real life.

07:48.551 --> 07:49.094
- Dammit!

07:49.386 --> 07:50.905
Why didn't you guys
tell me what time it was?

07:50.929 --> 07:52.329
Cover for me til
it get there, Liz?

07:52.514 --> 07:53.914
- You know, I'm
not sure if my rank

07:53.974 --> 07:55.767
is high enough to cover for you.

07:56.059 --> 07:57.143
Good luck, barbarian.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.965
- You feel lucky, punk?

08:27.257 --> 08:28.717
Hand over the goods.

08:29.926 --> 08:31.136
Yeah.

08:31.428 --> 08:33.429
Up against the wall.

08:33.722 --> 08:34.722
- You got me.

08:38.143 --> 08:40.186
- Hey, head on a swivel.

08:40.477 --> 08:41.688
What did I teach you?

08:41.980 --> 08:42.522
Always...

08:42.813 --> 08:44.482
- Be prepared,
always be prepared.

08:44.774 --> 08:45.316
Yeah!

08:45.608 --> 08:46.234
- Yeah, like a...

08:46.526 --> 08:47.068
like a Boy Scout.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.360
- No, like a Marine!

08:48.528 --> 08:49.528
Like a Marine!

08:50.530 --> 08:51.072
- Dude!

08:51.364 --> 08:52.364
Okay!

08:54.200 --> 08:55.368
Is that booze?

08:55.660 --> 08:56.660
-Um...

08:59.039 --> 09:01.875
No, it's my special blend.

09:02.167 --> 09:03.167
- Take it easy, Gramps.

09:03.293 --> 09:04.979
You know you're not supposed
to mix booze with your meds.

09:05.003 --> 09:05.545
- Yeah, yeah.

09:05.837 --> 09:06.981
Where you goin' in such a hurry?

09:07.005 --> 09:07.672
- I gotta go to work!

09:07.964 --> 09:09.257
I'm running behind.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.092
- You gamin' all day again?

09:11.384 --> 09:12.969
No!

09:13.261 --> 09:14.471
Yeah, maybe.

09:16.222 --> 09:17.742
- Well hold on a
second before you go.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.326
Remember that new
game you made for me?

09:19.350 --> 09:20.018
You know?

09:20.310 --> 09:20.935
I mean, it's good.

09:21.227 --> 09:21.895
- Oh, World War Poo?

09:22.187 --> 09:23.187
- Yeah, it's real good.

09:24.272 --> 09:25.392
Like it says, it's the shit.

09:25.607 --> 09:26.751
Ah, you really dig it?

09:26.775 --> 09:27.776
- Oh yeah.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.152
Yeah.

09:29.444 --> 09:30.737
Oh, and we got another letter

09:31.029 --> 09:33.114
from that tech school, you know?

09:33.406 --> 09:35.126
You know, they're still
accepting applicants

09:35.366 --> 09:36.659
for the next semester.

09:36.951 --> 09:37.619
- Yeah, I know.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.662
Look, I listened to
what you said and...

09:39.954 --> 09:40.954
it's just not for me.

09:41.122 --> 09:42.874
I'm kinda doin' my
own thing, and...

09:43.166 --> 09:44.918
tuition's really expensive.

09:45.210 --> 09:46.211
- You know, I'm...

09:46.503 --> 09:47.938
I mean, I'm never gonna
force you to do something

09:47.962 --> 09:49.506
that you don't want
to do, you know.

09:49.798 --> 09:51.438
But what I am gonna
force you to do, Max,

09:51.591 --> 09:53.760
is I'm gonna force
you to seize the day.

09:54.052 --> 09:54.594
Okay?

09:54.886 --> 09:55.512
I don't want you
wastin' your talents

09:55.804 --> 09:57.514
just throwin' 'em away.

09:58.598 --> 09:59.598
Hey.

10:00.725 --> 10:01.725
Come on.

10:03.019 --> 10:04.562
Now listen, soldier.

10:04.854 --> 10:07.524
You be a hero in your own life.

10:07.816 --> 10:08.816
Carpe diem.

10:09.651 --> 10:11.820
And not just in those games.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.739
I mean, if it's school,
we figure it out.

10:15.031 --> 10:17.867
If it's money, I'll
cash in some bonds.

10:18.159 --> 10:19.159
Hm?

10:21.037 --> 10:23.414
But whatever you decide,

10:23.706 --> 10:26.251
your mom and dad
would be real proud of you.

10:29.254 --> 10:30.254
- Okay, I gotta go.

10:30.296 --> 10:31.456
- There's steak and fries...

10:31.548 --> 10:32.173
- In the fridge.
- Tonight for dinner.

10:32.465 --> 10:33.007
Yeah.
- Yup.

10:33.299 --> 10:33.842
- Okay.

10:34.134 --> 10:34.676
And the blue plate.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.177
- Okay!

10:36.469 --> 10:37.469
- Yeah.

10:39.013 --> 10:40.098
World War Poo.

10:41.933 --> 10:42.933
What a kick.

10:46.729 --> 10:47.897
- Come on!

10:49.399 --> 10:52.360
Be the hero in your own life.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.779
Carpe deez nuts!

10:55.071 --> 10:56.071
Solid, Gramps.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.322
Solid.

11:06.332 --> 11:07.332
Okay!

11:07.375 --> 11:08.375
Let's do it.

11:32.025 --> 11:34.027
That's a cute little bike.

11:34.319 --> 11:34.861
Hey!

11:35.153 --> 11:35.695
What's up?

11:35.987 --> 11:37.322
It's Douche to the Maximus.

11:37.614 --> 11:38.323
- Yo!

11:38.615 --> 11:39.615
Sweet wheels, bro!

11:40.783 --> 11:41.783
- Where ya goin', buddy?

11:41.826 --> 11:42.452
- Oh, you know, just...

11:42.744 --> 11:43.744
goin' to work.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.122
Actually contributing
to society.

11:46.414 --> 11:47.725
Oh, cool of your mom
to let you bring out

11:47.749 --> 11:49.042
the midlife crisis mobile.

11:49.334 --> 11:49.876
Nice.

11:50.168 --> 11:51.168
- Oh.

11:51.419 --> 11:51.961
God, that's right.

11:52.253 --> 11:52.962
You're still
jockeying the counter

11:53.254 --> 11:54.607
with your little
boyfriend Reginald,

11:54.631 --> 11:56.549
making minimum
wage at Fallout Games.

11:56.841 --> 11:57.967
"Cause meanwhile, I mean,

11:58.259 --> 12:00.511
we're on the verge of
creating the next triple-A title.

12:00.803 --> 12:01.346
Triple-A?

12:01.638 --> 12:02.638
- Yeah, triple-A.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.762
- It's lookin' a little bit
like triple-♪ from over.

12:05.016 --> 12:06.434
- Doesn't even make sense, bro.

12:06.726 --> 12:07.726
- Triple douche!

12:07.977 --> 12:08.561
- Good one...

12:08.853 --> 12:09.896
Maxi Pad.

12:10.188 --> 12:12.690
Look, do me a favor,
and tell my sweet,

12:12.982 --> 12:15.026
sweet Lizzy hi for me.

12:15.318 --> 12:16.918
You wouldn't mind
doin' that, would you?

12:17.028 --> 12:17.737
- That's weird, Seth.

12:18.029 --> 12:20.257
She said she stopped talking
to you after you freaked out

12:20.281 --> 12:22.116
when she beat your
ass in Battle Clan.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.128
Oh, and the fact that
you have a micrope...

12:24.285 --> 12:25.828
- Okay, she didnt't...

12:26.788 --> 12:29.207
She did not kick
my as in Battle Clan.

12:29.499 --> 12:31.143
I let her win using
my profile to rank up.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.378
And what would you know, anyway?

12:33.670 --> 12:36.005
I mean, you can't even
afford a legit team, Maxi Pad.

12:36.297 --> 12:36.839
- Micropen...

12:37.131 --> 12:38.131
- Shut up!

12:38.174 --> 12:38.883
Chet!

12:39.175 --> 12:39.717
- Whatever, dude.

12:40.009 --> 12:40.551
- Hey, wait, wait, wait!

12:40.843 --> 12:42.553
One more thing.

12:44.013 --> 12:45.013
Blue lightning bolt!

12:48.101 --> 12:48.643
Later, Max.

12:48.935 --> 12:49.935
- See ya, loser!

12:57.610 --> 12:59.505
- Once you score the coke
from the strip club owner,

12:59.529 --> 13:01.364
your stamina
increases like crazy,

13:01.656 --> 13:04.117
and then you jack this
sick Ferrari out front.

13:04.409 --> 13:06.244
Drive that to the
bank, smoke the teller,

13:06.536 --> 13:07.696
and bounce out with the cash.

13:07.870 --> 13:10.164
Oh, and just say
know to the three H.

13:10.456 --> 13:10.999
- What's that?

13:11.291 --> 13:12.571
- Hookers, homicide, and heroin.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.853
You just wanna go back to
the nightclub with the score,

13:14.877 --> 13:15.962
and then, boom!

13:16.254 --> 13:17.414
You're XP doubles like crazy,

13:17.505 --> 13:19.048
and all the new weapons unlock.

13:19.340 --> 13:20.967
Including the machete.

13:22.010 --> 13:26.097
I don't think you'll
be playing this game.

13:31.978 --> 13:34.939
- Ah, another
satisfied customer.

13:35.231 --> 13:36.566
- What is wrong with people?

13:36.858 --> 13:37.858
It's just a game.

13:38.026 --> 13:38.735
- Preach.

13:39.027 --> 13:40.027
- Is that slushie?

13:40.194 --> 13:40.737
- Yeah!

13:41.029 --> 13:42.947
Seth and douche
squad send their regards.

13:43.239 --> 13:45.033
Max, I'm sorry.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.410
He's such an asshole.

13:47.702 --> 13:48.828
He's just jealous.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.120
- Wait...

13:50.288 --> 13:51.497
What do you mean?

13:51.789 --> 13:52.789
-Um...

13:53.666 --> 13:57.879
I mean, you're a better
coder and gamer and...

13:58.171 --> 13:59.171
You know.

14:00.590 --> 14:01.590
- Oh.

14:02.800 --> 14:06.012
- As I make the
harsh switch from VR

14:06.304 --> 14:09.974
to normal, boring-ass R,
do mine eyes deceive me,

14:10.266 --> 14:12.977
or is that Max Reload
I see arriving late

14:13.269 --> 14:14.979
yet again and very unkempt?

14:15.271 --> 14:16.481
- What up, Chuck?

14:17.440 --> 14:18.608
- Don't "what up Chuck" me!

14:18.900 --> 14:21.444
You two, come hither
back to my chamber!

14:21.736 --> 14:22.737
Entrance granted.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.029
- Copy that.

14:32.455 --> 14:33.539
- Max!

14:34.665 --> 14:35.665
Max!

14:36.751 --> 14:37.418
Hey, Liz.

14:37.710 --> 14:38.252
- Amazing.

14:38.544 --> 14:39.670
He rolls in late and...

14:39.962 --> 14:40.963
no punishment.

14:41.255 --> 14:42.548
He's so the golden child.

14:42.840 --> 14:43.549
- You know what?

14:43.841 --> 14:45.176
Lizbeth is right for a change.

14:45.468 --> 14:46.468
You were late, man,

14:46.511 --> 14:48.151
and I should call
attention to tardiness.

14:48.429 --> 14:51.015
Why is thou lateth again?

14:51.307 --> 14:52.683
- Sorry, Chuck.

14:52.975 --> 14:55.436
We got caught up in a
little bit of a loot quest.

14:55.728 --> 14:56.729
- Oh!

14:57.021 --> 14:58.856
- But unfortunately
we lost track of time.

14:59.148 --> 15:00.167
- Well you didn't say that, man.

15:00.191 --> 15:02.735
Did thou succeedeth
in thy quest?

15:03.027 --> 15:05.071
- Sadly, no, we didn't-ith.

15:06.406 --> 15:07.490
But I was close!

15:07.782 --> 15:09.784
I'm still ranked number
two in North America.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.870
- Well, young ward,
extra lives unto you

15:13.162 --> 15:14.539
to fight on to another day.

15:14.831 --> 15:16.767
You know, you really should
be considering East Forge.

15:16.791 --> 15:18.227
You guys should
put together a squad,

15:18.251 --> 15:19.377
team of some sort, you know?

15:19.669 --> 15:21.629
- Yeah, we would if we
could agree on a team name.

15:21.921 --> 15:22.505
- Oh-—-

15:22.797 --> 15:25.341
- I always thought the
Nuclear Nerds was kinda cool.

15:25.633 --> 15:26.833
"Nerds" is an old-school term,

15:27.093 --> 15:29.387
but it's now become empowered.

15:29.679 --> 15:30.888
And "nuclear"...

15:32.473 --> 15:34.725
That's as powerful as it gets.

15:35.017 --> 15:37.186
- Oh, that is good, Chuck!

15:37.478 --> 15:39.772
That's not too shabby.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.064
- Was that pandering?

15:41.315 --> 15:42.859
Were you pandering to me, Max?

15:43.151 --> 15:44.193
Max in all the slacks?

15:44.485 --> 15:46.279
I always put you high
above everyone else,

15:46.571 --> 15:47.811
and this is what happens to me?

15:47.905 --> 15:48.614
Guess what.

15:48.906 --> 15:50.366
That just earned
you bathroom duty!

15:50.658 --> 15:51.658
Justice, am I right?

15:51.742 --> 15:52.285
Thank you!

15:52.577 --> 15:53.119
- You're welcome.

15:53.411 --> 15:54.971
And guess what, I
had Indian for lunch.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.641
I know, everyone
warned me against it,

15:56.873 --> 15:57.957
including my mother, man,

15:58.249 --> 16:00.710
but I had extra curry on
top of the Curry Surprise.

16:01.002 --> 16:03.004
So guess what's comin'
out thick and creamy.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.173
My Indian lunch, and
you're gonna follow it

16:05.465 --> 16:08.176
into the bathroom,
so that's what you get

16:08.468 --> 16:09.010
for that...

16:09.302 --> 16:09.844
Yo, Chuck!

16:10.136 --> 16:11.596
Steve's here!

16:11.888 --> 16:13.431
- Well send him back!

16:14.849 --> 16:15.849
Business.

16:16.642 --> 16:17.310
Steve!

16:17.602 --> 16:19.145
Man, in Steve I believe!

16:19.437 --> 16:21.189
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

16:21.481 --> 16:22.064
- It's heavy.

16:22.356 --> 16:24.076
- What are you saying,
I couldn't handle it?

16:24.358 --> 16:25.067
Kidding.

16:25.359 --> 16:27.153
- I got tons more
in the truck, too, bro.

16:27.445 --> 16:28.154
Liz.

16:28.446 --> 16:29.864
- Hell yeah, dog!

16:30.156 --> 16:31.156
- Hey!

16:31.282 --> 16:31.908
Randall!

16:32.200 --> 16:33.200
-It's...

16:34.619 --> 16:37.663
- The Hard Light VR
Haptic Feedback Vest, man!

16:37.955 --> 16:41.959
This is the holy grail of
virtual reality gut punches!

16:42.251 --> 16:45.421
You put this on, and
everything you feel in VR

16:45.713 --> 16:48.674
feels more real, and I
mean everything you feel.

16:48.966 --> 16:49.967
If you feel self-doubt,

16:50.259 --> 16:52.386
you're gonna feel
haptic self-doubt, man!

16:52.678 --> 16:53.804
If you feel self-loathing,

16:54.096 --> 16:55.765
you're gonna feel
haptic self-loathing!

16:56.057 --> 16:56.682
Thank you, Steve!

16:56.974 --> 16:59.769
I know exactly what I'm
gonna do for the next 48 hours.

17:00.061 --> 17:01.938
- So you're gonna wear
this thing for 48 hours?

17:02.230 --> 17:02.897
- Damn skippy!

17:03.189 --> 17:05.566
For the next 48 hours,
I'm gonna be all in VR,

17:05.858 --> 17:08.486
so this is my
VR-mor, if you will.

17:08.778 --> 17:09.904
- Whoa, bro.

17:10.195 --> 17:12.240
Playing games for
two days straight?

17:12.531 --> 17:13.531
That...

17:13.741 --> 17:15.409
IS some serious stamina.

17:15.701 --> 17:16.827
- Playing games?

17:18.788 --> 17:19.867
Steve, man, I thought I had

17:19.914 --> 17:21.394
all the respect in
the world for you.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.540
Playing games?

17:22.583 --> 17:23.960
This ain't' playin' games, son!

17:24.252 --> 17:25.336
This is V...

17:25.627 --> 17:26.627
R!

17:26.712 --> 17:27.712
VR, man!

17:27.964 --> 17:29.966
You don't play a
game; you are the game!

17:30.258 --> 17:31.258
You're experiencing.

17:31.509 --> 17:32.589
That's what the R in VR is.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.095
<i>You "R" there, don'.</i>

17:34.387 --> 17:36.722
So you're not just sittin' there,
playing hockey on a game.

17:37.014 --> 17:38.432
You're in the rink!

17:38.724 --> 17:41.352
VR is for those of us
who are grown up enough

17:41.644 --> 17:43.813
to wear something like
this around the house.

17:44.105 --> 17:47.149
Kids, unless the stores
on fire this weekend,

17:47.441 --> 17:49.819
I am not to be bothered
when I am jacked in!

17:50.111 --> 17:52.780
Endurance trial, yes!

17:53.072 --> 17:53.656
So cool.

17:53.948 --> 17:54.657
- He knows.

17:54.949 --> 17:55.575
- Signature, please.

17:55.866 --> 17:56.866
- Thanks.

17:57.785 --> 17:58.452
Thank you.

17:58.744 --> 17:59.287
-So...

17:59.579 --> 18:01.289
the rest of the boxes?

18:01.581 --> 18:03.291
- Not here, Reggie!

18:03.583 --> 18:04.893
You guys do it
in the other room.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.587
You and Lizbeth
unpack and catalog there.

18:07.878 --> 18:09.964
Back here, the grown men

18:10.256 --> 18:12.258
are gonna be trying
on our fancy boy outfits.

18:12.550 --> 18:13.092
Just look at this.

18:13.384 --> 18:15.511
There's so many snaps
and buttons and straps.

18:15.803 --> 18:16.345
I'm gonna need a normie,

18:16.637 --> 18:18.077
a thin kid to help
me out with this,

18:18.347 --> 18:20.224
'cause I'm sure this
one goes some place

18:20.516 --> 18:23.644
I ain't seen in like at
least 12 to 13 years.

19:02.683 --> 19:03.225
- Hey, listen.

19:03.517 --> 19:04.101
Why don't you come to
the gym with me sometime?

19:04.393 --> 19:06.646
I'll teach you all the
ropes, and I'll spot you.

19:06.937 --> 19:07.605
- That would be amazing.

19:07.897 --> 19:09.666
I've been thinking about getting
a membership somewhere.

19:09.690 --> 19:12.318
And I also try to do my
1,000 steps every day.

19:12.610 --> 19:13.610
- Sweet!

19:14.612 --> 19:16.030
Well, it's gettin'
to be that time.

19:16.322 --> 19:17.657
Got more loads to deliver.

19:17.948 --> 19:18.948
<i>Steve-0, out.</i>

19:20.451 --> 19:21.452
- Bye, Steve.

19:24.413 --> 19:26.582
Got more loads to deliver.

19:26.874 --> 19:27.416
Ugh!

19:27.708 --> 19:28.250
Gross!

19:28.542 --> 19:29.782
And "I try to get my steps in"?

19:29.835 --> 19:30.544
Who are you?

19:30.836 --> 19:33.714
By the way, Chuck is
officially suited up, off the grid.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.216
We're on our own.

19:36.801 --> 19:38.761
- John Carmack, hands down.

19:39.053 --> 19:41.389
Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Quake?

19:41.681 --> 19:43.516
I mean, come on, the
dude's a complete legend.

19:43.808 --> 19:46.185
Plus, I hear he's like a
legit aerospace engineer.

19:46.477 --> 19:48.437
- Yeah, sure, but he didn't
pioneer the movement.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.314
He was like second
or third wave.

19:50.606 --> 19:52.066
- Dude, is Miyamoto.

19:52.358 --> 19:54.276
Donkey Kong, Mario?

19:54.568 --> 19:56.404
Draws that shit by hand.

19:56.696 --> 19:59.115
The guys a French
knight who's Japanese.

19:59.407 --> 20:00.116
- Respect.

20:00.408 --> 20:03.494
But guys, I'm talking
about the most legendary

20:03.786 --> 20:06.247
and influential game
developer of all time.

20:06.539 --> 20:07.539
- Here we go again.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.166
...Our hometown here...

20:09.458 --> 20:10.126
Eugene Wylder!

20:10.418 --> 20:12.837
Creator of the Nether series!

20:13.129 --> 20:13.713
Guys!

20:14.004 --> 20:15.004
The one and only!

20:15.089 --> 20:16.729
You think any of this
would have happened

20:17.007 --> 20:19.009
if it wasn't for the
pixel master himself?

20:19.301 --> 20:21.262
All right, check it out, legit.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.475
The year: 1984.

20:26.767 --> 20:30.229
The location: Wylde Child
Games in small town Middletown.

20:30.521 --> 20:32.565
A revolutionary
console video game

20:32.857 --> 20:34.859
and best-selling
fantasy franchise

20:35.151 --> 20:39.071
lies solely in the hands of
two rogue video game creators.

20:39.363 --> 20:41.365
Barton Grabowski
and Eugene Wylder

20:41.657 --> 20:44.201
develop the groundbreaking
Nether game series

20:44.493 --> 20:46.620
for the ColecoVision
home entertainment system.

20:46.912 --> 20:49.749
The dynamic duo are seen
here, working on the last

20:50.040 --> 20:54.295
Wylde Child Games
installment, Nether Dungeon.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.964
- Geno, you've totally
outdone yourself, man!

20:57.256 --> 20:58.632
You are amazing!

20:58.924 --> 21:02.386
- And you are way too
close to me right now.

21:03.763 --> 21:04.930
He's a genius!

21:05.222 --> 21:07.302
They met in the
sandbox in grade school.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.268
Best friends Eugene and Bart

21:09.560 --> 21:11.854
became known as
the bad boys of gaming,

21:12.146 --> 21:15.232
working hard and
playing even harder.

21:24.825 --> 21:27.703
- We did two million
units and change

21:27.995 --> 21:31.207
on our last release,
Nether Scrolls.

21:31.499 --> 21:34.919
And this go around, the
demand is just so much higher,

21:35.211 --> 21:36.921
not just in terms of financials,

21:37.213 --> 21:39.548
but graphics, story,
the whole thing.

21:39.840 --> 21:42.384
Sorry, can you sign this?

21:43.719 --> 21:45.346
- This is gonna be
a real game changer

21:45.638 --> 21:47.723
for the way our fans
experience these games.

21:48.015 --> 21:49.295
We're working really hard on it,

21:49.475 --> 21:51.685
and it's going to be radical.

21:52.770 --> 21:54.570
With high-dollar
profits at stake

21:54.605 --> 21:57.024
and growing expectations
from investors and fans,

21:57.316 --> 22:01.195
the stress level mounted for
the gurus at Wylde Child Games.

22:05.241 --> 22:06.450
- I'm working here!

22:06.742 --> 22:07.742
Piss off!

22:07.868 --> 22:10.120
Alcohol and
drugs, caffeine pills

22:10.412 --> 22:12.915
and store-bought bakery
goods would come to be known

22:13.207 --> 22:15.668
as Eugene's Ho
Hos and Hoes phase.

22:15.960 --> 22:16.960
- New high score!

22:17.211 --> 22:18.811
Ravaging his brilliant mind

22:19.088 --> 22:20.548
and halting development.

22:20.840 --> 22:24.260
Sadly, Nether Dungeon
would never see the light of day.

22:31.809 --> 22:33.727
- Yeah, it's a total loss.

22:34.019 --> 22:37.147
I'm not at liberty to comment
on the cause right now,

22:37.439 --> 22:40.776
but my team will be investigating
over the next few days

22:41.068 --> 22:41.610
any possib...

22:41.902 --> 22:43.338
- Hey, Chief, it's
definitely arson.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.030
I'm having the
guys pull extra lines.

22:54.248 --> 22:55.457
- This isn't live, is it?

22:55.749 --> 22:58.252
Allegations of sabotage
and insurance fraud

22:58.544 --> 23:01.005
were the only thing
rising from the ashes

23:01.297 --> 23:03.215
of Wylde Child Games.

23:03.507 --> 23:06.051
Tragically, Nether
Dungeon and the rekindling

23:06.343 --> 23:09.722
between Wylder and Grabowski
would never materialize.

23:10.014 --> 23:11.974
The Wylde Child
catalog was sold off

23:12.266 --> 23:14.602
to rival gaming giant Konicom,

23:14.894 --> 23:16.254
which released
future installments

23:16.353 --> 23:18.814
of the Nether series
to mixed reviews.

23:19.106 --> 23:20.733
- Nether Dungeons,
never happening!

23:21.025 --> 23:22.025
Now back off!

23:22.234 --> 23:24.236
Eugene fell of the
map into seclusion,

23:24.528 --> 23:26.572
some speculate
leaving the country.

23:26.864 --> 23:29.450
Barton Grabowski invested
what financial resources

23:29.742 --> 23:32.077
he had left in the
arcade business,

23:32.369 --> 23:33.996
founding Cobra Arcade Bar,

23:34.288 --> 23:37.750
a hip arcade that
serves adult beverages.

23:38.042 --> 23:40.461
This concludes this
week's Arcade Heroes.

23:40.753 --> 23:41.753
- I rest my case.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.231
What they don't
tell you in this video

23:43.255 --> 23:46.091
is that Wylder made such
a perfectly badass game

23:46.383 --> 23:48.844
that rival game companies
colluded to burn down his building

23:49.136 --> 23:51.221
and destroy every copy
of the Neter Dungeon.

23:51.513 --> 23:53.313
They threatened him
so he wouldn't release it.

23:53.599 --> 23:55.351
- Your man crush for
this burnout Wylder

23:55.643 --> 23:58.938
and, frankly, all things
retro is highly concerning.

23:59.229 --> 24:00.229
- I don't know.

24:00.272 --> 24:00.940
He seemed pretty cool.

24:01.231 --> 24:01.899
- Yeah.

24:02.191 --> 24:04.360
- You agree with
everything Max says.

24:04.652 --> 24:05.277
Come on.

24:05.569 --> 24:07.196
It's time to bounce.

24:07.488 --> 24:08.488
See you later, buddy.

24:08.614 --> 24:09.156
- What?

24:09.448 --> 24:09.990
Guys, come on!

24:10.282 --> 24:11.635
Don't you want to
stay til my shift's up?

24:11.659 --> 24:12.201
Come on!

24:12.493 --> 24:13.595
No one comes in on weeknights!

24:13.619 --> 24:15.339
And who knows what
Chuck's doing back there?

24:15.412 --> 24:17.015
- It's all-you-can-eat
at Pistol Pete's, dude.

24:17.039 --> 24:18.266
- Catch you online
tonight, then?

24:18.290 --> 24:18.832
- I'm there.

24:19.124 --> 24:19.667
- Maybe.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.519
Oh, hey, someone's
gotta clean the bathroom.

24:21.543 --> 24:22.543
Bye!

24:22.586 --> 24:25.714
Oh my god.

24:39.979 --> 24:40.979
- So smooth!

24:43.190 --> 24:44.190
So soft.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.237
Round, brown, oh, yes.

24:51.407 --> 24:52.407
So wet.

24:58.372 --> 24:59.372
- Welcome to Fallout!

24:59.498 --> 25:01.083
Just a minute!

25:01.375 --> 25:03.085
Sorry about that, I...

25:12.344 --> 25:13.344
What?

25:15.222 --> 25:16.682
Hey!

25:16.974 --> 25:18.225
Hey!

25:18.517 --> 25:20.644
I can give you store credit!

25:33.032 --> 25:34.032
No way.

25:38.704 --> 25:40.544
Chuck, are you messing
with me, dude, 'cause...

25:42.291 --> 25:43.291
Chuck?

25:48.380 --> 25:49.381
- Look at my dick!

25:49.673 --> 25:51.800
Man, I love virtual flasher.

25:53.260 --> 25:54.420
- Yo, dude, you close up yet?

25:54.511 --> 25:55.511
Pistol Pete's is poppin'!

25:55.679 --> 25:56.679
-Reg...

25:56.722 --> 25:58.849
Dude, are you
messin' with me, man?

25:59.141 --> 25:59.683
Don't lie.

25:59.975 --> 26:00.517
- I can't hear you, dude.

26:00.809 --> 26:01.351
It's loud in here.

26:01.643 --> 26:03.580
- Is this like a practical
joke or something, dude?

26:03.604 --> 26:04.646
- What's up, barbarian?

26:04.938 --> 26:05.938
You comin' down or what?

26:06.065 --> 26:06.607
- Tell me the truth.

26:06.899 --> 26:08.259
Did you leave a
box of stuff here?

26:08.317 --> 26:08.984
I mean, come on.

26:09.276 --> 26:10.276
It's pretty obvious.

26:10.402 --> 26:11.779
- Max, we're off
the clock, dude.

26:12.071 --> 26:13.071
Get your ass down here.

26:13.238 --> 26:15.741
He's dippin' in the barbecue
sauce again like a psycho.

26:16.033 --> 26:17.677
Why you gotta
give me up like that?

26:17.701 --> 26:19.411
Because it's weird.

26:19.703 --> 26:20.245
All right, dude.

26:20.537 --> 26:21.537
Bye.

26:50.109 --> 26:51.151
Boy!

26:51.443 --> 26:53.862
You are louder than
a pig in purgatory.

26:54.154 --> 26:56.573
You gotta work on your heel-toe.

26:56.865 --> 26:58.450
What's that for?

26:58.742 --> 27:00.077
- Is it okay if I use this?

27:00.369 --> 27:01.649
- Well, it belonged to your dad.

27:01.703 --> 27:03.056
I mean, the screen
isn't much use to anyb...

27:03.080 --> 27:03.622
- 'Kay, cool.

27:03.914 --> 27:04.456
Thank you, gramps.

27:04.748 --> 27:06.142
- I can't even see my
reflection in that screen,

27:06.166 --> 27:08.127
but then, who gives a shit?

27:08.418 --> 27:09.545
I don't give a shit.

27:42.327 --> 27:45.164
- Dare you enter
the Nether Dungeon

27:46.331 --> 27:48.417
in the fight for the ages?

27:56.133 --> 27:57.968
Make a name for myself.

28:00.179 --> 28:00.846
What up?

28:01.138 --> 28:03.390
This is Max Jenkins,
AKA Max Reload.

28:03.682 --> 28:07.352
Guys, I have come into
possession of a legit,

28:07.644 --> 28:10.939
long-lost copy of a
Nether Dungeon cartridge.

28:11.231 --> 28:12.951
It's the only one
known in existence, so...

28:13.150 --> 28:14.526
it's pretty badass.

28:16.028 --> 28:18.280
It's crazy badass, man!

28:18.572 --> 28:19.948
Well...

28:20.240 --> 28:22.409
welcome to my play-through.

28:22.701 --> 28:24.077
Let's make history.

29:22.552 --> 29:24.638
Time to put up or shut up.

29:55.294 --> 29:56.294
What the?

29:57.087 --> 29:58.087
That's it?

30:00.632 --> 30:01.675
Well...

30:01.967 --> 30:03.510
You saw it here first, folks.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.804
The rarest game on the planet,

30:06.096 --> 30:08.390
beat in one sitting
by yours truly.

30:08.682 --> 30:11.768
You saw it here first on
Max Reload's Game Hub.

30:12.060 --> 30:13.060
Ah, man.

30:13.312 --> 30:15.981
I bet you guys wish you
could play it, too, huh?

30:16.273 --> 30:19.568
That would make me
legend status for sure.

31:05.030 --> 31:06.323
Holy shit!

31:06.615 --> 31:07.157
Shit, shit, shit!

31:07.449 --> 31:08.158
No, no, no, no, no, no!

31:08.450 --> 31:09.450
Penelope, no!

31:14.664 --> 31:15.664
Shit.

31:18.668 --> 31:19.668
Shit.

31:21.797 --> 31:22.797
Dammit.

31:34.684 --> 31:35.352
What?

31:35.644 --> 31:36.644
Oh, god.

31:37.813 --> 31:38.480
What?

31:38.772 --> 31:39.356
- Max!

31:39.648 --> 31:40.648
Holy cow, man!

31:40.690 --> 31:41.316
Where have you been?

31:41.608 --> 31:43.008
Have you seen
you're freaking site?

31:43.276 --> 31:44.361
-No, my...

31:44.653 --> 31:47.155
rig got fried in the
storm last night.

31:47.447 --> 31:48.907
Freaking surge protector.

31:49.199 --> 31:50.199
I haven't seen shit.

31:50.325 --> 31:51.325
- What storm?

31:51.535 --> 31:52.077
Dude, whatever!

31:52.369 --> 31:52.953
Get to the store, okay?

31:53.245 --> 31:54.245
This is off the charts!

31:54.371 --> 31:54.913
I mean...

31:55.205 --> 31:56.498
Nether Dungeon?

31:56.790 --> 31:57.790
- Yo, dingleberry...

31:57.874 --> 31:58.874
you're late again.

31:59.042 --> 32:00.502
Get your ass to work.

32:00.794 --> 32:01.794
- What time is it?

32:01.837 --> 32:02.379
6:00 p.m., dude.

32:02.671 --> 32:03.815
You're like beyond
late, but don't worry.

32:03.839 --> 32:05.274
Chuck's still like
balls deep in VR.

32:09.010 --> 32:10.410
- Yeah, it's super
gnarly in there.

32:10.595 --> 32:11.955
I'm pretty sure
he shit his pants.

32:12.222 --> 32:13.348
Not it!
- Not it!

32:15.225 --> 32:15.892
- Holy crap!

32:16.184 --> 32:17.978
Dude, people are
sharing it like crazy!

32:18.270 --> 32:20.981
- You're telling me
that some dude in a suit

32:21.273 --> 32:23.942
just came in and dropped
off that box last night and left?

32:24.234 --> 32:25.902
And that the only known version

32:26.194 --> 32:27.487
of the Nether Dungeon was in it?

32:27.779 --> 32:28.864
- I know it sounds nuts.

32:29.156 --> 32:30.508
I mean, I've been
wanting to play this game

32:30.532 --> 32:31.592
since I could hold a controller.

32:31.616 --> 32:33.827
But I'm telling you,
that's what happened.

32:34.119 --> 32:38.707
It was like I knew every
move, like it was made for me.

32:38.999 --> 32:39.999
I beat it in one shot.

32:40.250 --> 32:43.503
Then, I emulated to my
site, and my rig gets fried.

32:43.795 --> 32:44.963
- Okay, that sucks.

32:45.255 --> 32:46.255
But major street cred.

32:46.339 --> 32:48.151
I mean, it's just so rad,
the fact that you even got it

32:48.175 --> 32:49.175
and then uploaded it.

32:49.384 --> 32:49.885
Are you kidding me?

32:50.177 --> 32:51.279
- I don't know how
you guys stomach

32:51.303 --> 32:53.054
all that crusty retro stuff.

32:53.346 --> 32:57.225
It's all about polygon
count and texture mapping.

32:57.517 --> 32:58.757
Hey, are you guys gonna help me

32:58.852 --> 33:00.052
with this new display or what?

33:00.228 --> 33:01.228
- No.

33:01.813 --> 33:03.356
- No appreciation.

33:03.648 --> 33:04.816
Ugh, you didn't even play it?

33:05.108 --> 33:06.108
- Pass.

33:06.234 --> 33:07.360
And you know what, Max?

33:07.652 --> 33:10.155
I bet that game is worth
a lot of money on eBay.

33:10.447 --> 33:11.156
- Whoa.

33:11.448 --> 33:13.208
This kid is totally
trolling you in the vlog.

33:13.450 --> 33:14.075
- What?

33:14.367 --> 33:15.428
- Let me tell you something

33:15.452 --> 33:17.537
about this Nether
Dungeon play-through.

33:17.829 --> 33:19.539
It's fake with a capital F.

33:19.831 --> 33:22.918
Guys, obviously
this Max Reload loser

33:23.210 --> 33:26.379
faked the gameplay footage,
he's faking the walkthrough,

33:26.671 --> 33:28.798
just so he can gain subscribers.

33:29.090 --> 33:30.258
Look, I get it, Max.

33:30.550 --> 33:32.110
I've got a YouTube
channel, too, buddy!

33:32.385 --> 33:33.529
Buy know what you just did...

33:33.553 --> 33:34.095
- What?

33:34.387 --> 33:34.888
Ah, this tool!

33:35.180 --> 33:35.764
- Okay, screw him.

33:36.056 --> 33:38.391
I believe you, and
people are loving it.

33:38.683 --> 33:39.351
- Hey.

33:39.643 --> 33:42.187
Remember that Wylder game?

33:42.479 --> 33:43.772
Yo, you have to check this out.

33:44.064 --> 33:45.524
Pull up his website.

33:47.150 --> 33:48.944
- Way ahead of you, bro.

33:49.236 --> 33:51.238
I already pulled it up
and finished downloading.

33:51.530 --> 33:52.906
This is why I get the big chair.

33:53.198 --> 33:54.324
- Well, all right, kids.

33:54.616 --> 33:56.451
We've got some
exciting news for you.

33:56.743 --> 33:58.828
The rumors, I've sure
you've heard them before,

33:59.120 --> 34:01.081
about Nether Dungeons
actually existing

34:01.373 --> 34:03.041
and surfacing are true.

34:03.333 --> 34:04.000
I am so stoked.

34:04.292 --> 34:04.834
- All right?

34:05.126 --> 34:07.754
You're gonna be a gaming
legend with all these hits.

34:08.045 --> 34:09.045
- Yeah.

34:11.091 --> 34:13.552
- I don't buy it for a second.

34:15.637 --> 34:16.846
- What a douche!

34:17.138 --> 34:18.514
You think it's the real deal?

34:18.806 --> 34:19.808
- No freaking way.

34:20.100 --> 34:21.976
That loser had to have
made this garbage.

34:22.268 --> 34:23.268
- Fake.

34:23.353 --> 34:23.937
He thinks he's so smart

34:24.228 --> 34:25.981
running all this hype
through his own site.

34:26.273 --> 34:28.315
- Actually, it is pretty smart.

34:28.608 --> 34:29.688
I wish I had thought of it.

34:29.943 --> 34:31.570
But, not for long.

34:31.860 --> 34:33.905
I found a backdoor
and copied the script,

34:34.197 --> 34:35.949
so it's free to play and
download everywhere

34:36.241 --> 34:37.409
through our site now.

34:38.952 --> 34:40.192
I also embedded a worm to steal

34:40.411 --> 34:42.414
users' email lists
and spread it.

34:42.706 --> 34:45.792
Say goodbye to
those hits, Maxie.

34:46.083 --> 34:48.878
Oh, and, icing on the
cake, I also ported it

34:49.170 --> 34:52.632
to mobile platform, so
no emulator required.

34:52.924 --> 34:53.466
- You rock!

34:53.757 --> 34:54.301
- I know I do.

34:54.592 --> 34:56.928
This is gonna go
wide, my friends.

35:00.640 --> 35:02.160
- I mean, it's like
destiny, you know?

35:02.267 --> 35:05.770
How crazy is it that that
game found its way to me?

35:06.062 --> 35:06.605
Yeah.

35:06.896 --> 35:07.480
Whatever you say, dude?

35:07.772 --> 35:08.315
- Right, Reg?

35:08.607 --> 35:09.149
Back me up.

35:09.441 --> 35:11.818
I mean, it's beyond coincidence.

35:12.110 --> 35:13.110
Reg?

35:14.404 --> 35:15.404
Holy shit!

35:15.488 --> 35:16.740
Reggie, what the hell, man?

35:17.032 --> 35:18.032
- Seriously?

35:18.074 --> 35:19.194
- Your eyes, man, your eyes!

35:19.409 --> 35:20.410
What's wrong with you?

35:22.162 --> 35:23.413
Reggie, what the hell, man?

35:23.705 --> 35:24.247
- Oh my god.

35:24.539 --> 35:25.081
- You okay?

35:25.373 --> 35:25.915
- Yeah.

35:26.207 --> 35:27.207
I mean, no.

35:28.251 --> 35:29.252
- I got this.

35:31.713 --> 35:33.423
You need to calm...

35:33.715 --> 35:34.257
down.

35:34.549 --> 35:35.091
Reggie!

35:35.383 --> 35:36.593
Reggie, stop it!

35:36.885 --> 35:37.427
Dude!

35:37.719 --> 35:39.304
Okay, Reggie, Reggie, hey!

35:39.596 --> 35:40.597
Slow down!

35:40.889 --> 35:41.431
Liz?

35:41.723 --> 35:42.307
Liz, you good?

35:42.599 --> 35:44.851
- No, I mean, his
eyes are glowing red!

35:45.143 --> 35:45.685
- Reggie!

35:45.977 --> 35:46.519
Chuck!

35:46.811 --> 35:47.811
Chuck!

35:47.937 --> 35:49.057
- Oh, you want some of this?

35:49.189 --> 35:50.189
You wanna a piece, too?

35:50.440 --> 35:51.440
What about you?

35:51.650 --> 35:53.360
Oh yeah, here we go!

35:57.280 --> 35:58.680
Hey, Nether dick...

36:12.796 --> 36:13.796
- Reggie!

36:14.589 --> 36:15.589
Reggie?

36:15.632 --> 36:16.174
Hey.

36:16.466 --> 36:17.466
What did you do?

36:17.634 --> 36:19.194
I saved your bacon, kid.

36:19.302 --> 36:19.844
Boom!

36:20.136 --> 36:21.136
High score.

36:21.888 --> 36:22.889
I saved both of you.

36:23.181 --> 36:23.723
You're welcome.

36:24.015 --> 36:25.015
- You killed Reggie!

36:25.183 --> 36:25.725
-Uh ..

36:26.017 --> 36:27.310
How's that?

36:27.602 --> 36:28.602
No.

36:29.187 --> 36:31.272
No, I didn't kill
anybody, did 1?

36:31.564 --> 36:32.564
Oh boy.

36:33.525 --> 36:34.067
- Oh my god.

36:34.359 --> 36:35.568
- Now, see?

36:35.860 --> 36:37.112
You scared me there, kid.

36:37.404 --> 36:38.697
- Wait.

36:38.988 --> 36:39.656
You're Eugene...

36:39.948 --> 36:41.509
- Eugene Wylder,
yeah, the one and only.

36:41.533 --> 36:42.242
And you...

36:42.534 --> 36:43.910
are Max, right?

36:44.202 --> 36:46.037
The little turd that
ported my game

36:46.329 --> 36:49.582
and set this whole
shit show in motion.

36:49.874 --> 36:50.959
- No.

36:51.251 --> 36:53.503
- You have no idea what
you're messin' with, kid.

36:53.795 --> 36:56.089
Supernatural malevolence
from ages long past

36:56.381 --> 36:58.174
melded with supreme
power over mankind.

36:58.466 --> 37:00.885
Communications, gaming, tech.

37:01.177 --> 37:03.138
You know what, the
less you know, the better.

37:03.430 --> 37:06.015
- I have no idea what you just
said, but it sounds awesome.

37:06.307 --> 37:06.933
- Yeah, you know what's awesome?

37:07.225 --> 37:08.351
My helmet is awesome.

37:08.643 --> 37:10.895
My blasters are awesome.

37:11.187 --> 37:12.397
And right now...

37:13.398 --> 37:14.398
I am awesome.

37:14.524 --> 37:15.524
Okay, it's off your site.

37:15.608 --> 37:16.794
You're so lucky I
got here when I did.

37:16.818 --> 37:18.987
And I am lucky
that your site is...

37:19.279 --> 37:20.279
shit.

37:20.488 --> 37:23.074
I mean, no offense, but
like the SEO is total crap.

37:23.366 --> 37:24.366
- Hey!

37:24.492 --> 37:25.034
- What?

37:25.326 --> 37:25.869
What?

37:26.161 --> 37:27.161
All right, you know what?

37:27.328 --> 37:28.639
Give me the hard copy
of the game you have

37:28.663 --> 37:30.707
and tell me where you got it.

37:30.999 --> 37:32.333
- I don't have it.

37:32.625 --> 37:33.625
It's at my house.

37:33.752 --> 37:34.854
Look, some old dude
in a suit brought it

37:34.878 --> 37:35.545
and put it right there.

37:35.837 --> 37:36.379
And I just...
- An old dude?

37:36.671 --> 37:38.089
Ugh, the Harbinger, of course.

37:38.381 --> 37:39.507
Of course.

37:39.799 --> 37:40.341
Fine.

37:40.633 --> 37:41.176
Let's shit blood and go get it.

37:41.468 --> 37:42.010
- Shit...

37:42.302 --> 37:43.362
Wait, shit blood?
- No, no, no, no.

37:43.386 --> 37:44.095
Shitting blood?

37:44.387 --> 37:45.555
First things first, bud.

37:45.847 --> 37:47.223
You roll into our
store and blast

37:47.515 --> 37:49.976
our zombied-out friend
here with your ghetto-rigged

37:50.268 --> 37:52.061
light blaster,
dressed like some...

37:52.353 --> 37:55.148
<i>Bargain basement Boba
Felt cosplay asshole,</i>

37:55.440 --> 37:57.609
and you think that
you're calling the shots?

37:57.901 --> 37:59.194
Uh-uh.

37:59.486 --> 38:01.404
Max isn't going
anywhere until you tell us

38:01.696 --> 38:03.990
what the hell is going on here!

38:04.282 --> 38:05.282
- Hm.

38:05.366 --> 38:06.367
I like her.

38:06.659 --> 38:07.659
- Yeah, she's all right.

38:07.744 --> 38:10.705
- Fine, you want
an origin story?

38:10.997 --> 38:13.208
Hold onto your marshmallows.

38:13.500 --> 38:15.293
Pull your wieners up
to the cocktail party,

38:15.585 --> 38:19.172
ladies and gentlemen,
"cause the year was 1984."

38:19.464 --> 38:20.799
- Is that a Ho Ho?

38:21.090 --> 38:22.090
- Yeah.

38:22.217 --> 38:24.302
It was 1984, and
I'd been basking

38:24.594 --> 38:25.678
in the glory of my success.

38:25.970 --> 38:27.806
I was the developer
in the industry.

38:28.097 --> 38:29.408
I'd already announced
Nether Dungeon,

38:29.432 --> 38:31.272
and the pressure was
on to deliver another hit.

38:31.434 --> 38:32.685
But the only thing I hit...

38:32.977 --> 38:34.896
was a wall created
with coder's depression.

38:35.188 --> 38:36.707
I was on the verge
of something brilliant,

38:36.731 --> 38:38.542
but I just couldn't get the
code right for the game.

38:38.566 --> 38:41.778
Something just didn't
taste right in flavor town.

38:42.070 --> 38:43.780
I had been partying
my butt off for weeks.

38:44.072 --> 38:45.072
Don't get me wrong.

38:45.114 --> 38:47.534
Well-earned philandering,
barely sleeping.

38:47.826 --> 38:48.368
- Philandering?

38:48.660 --> 38:49.660
- It means whoring.

38:49.702 --> 38:51.597
Apparently, when dudes
do it, it's fancy and cool.

38:51.621 --> 38:52.981
- I'm sorry, who's
tell the story?

38:53.248 --> 38:53.790
You?

38:54.082 --> 38:54.624
Me?

38:54.916 --> 38:55.458
Me.

38:55.750 --> 38:57.470
So one night I drove
and I drove and I drove

38:57.585 --> 38:59.212
until I reached
a little dive bar

38:59.504 --> 39:01.130
on the outskirts of the desert.

39:01.422 --> 39:02.422
I needed distance.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.592
An artiste needs
his solace to create.

39:04.884 --> 39:05.903
Give me a break.

39:05.927 --> 39:06.927
- I said solace!

39:06.970 --> 39:08.370
I begged the
universe to inspire me

39:08.513 --> 39:10.682
to create my game for the ages.

39:10.974 --> 39:11.974
And that's...

39:12.183 --> 39:13.685
Well, that's when he appeared.

39:13.977 --> 39:15.645
I call him the Harbinger now,

39:15.937 --> 39:17.081
because over time I've learned

39:17.105 --> 39:19.274
that he's the one
who delivers the rules,

39:19.566 --> 39:22.694
the bad news, and
offers the challenges.

39:22.986 --> 39:24.213
Plus, it sounds
dark and mysterious,

39:24.237 --> 39:25.589
which is exactly
what this dude was.

39:25.613 --> 39:26.799
Oh my god, you
should have seen him!

39:26.823 --> 39:27.490
- Whoa.

39:27.782 --> 39:29.659
- You can say that again.

39:30.785 --> 39:31.452
- Whoa.

39:31.744 --> 39:32.287
- I didn't mean it.

39:32.579 --> 39:33.121
- Oh.

39:33.413 --> 39:34.974
So he mumbles that
he can provide the code

39:34.998 --> 39:36.666
and the key to
finishing my game.

39:36.958 --> 39:38.018
I don't remember what he said,

39:38.042 --> 39:40.002
but I was compelled to
insert the code he gave me.

39:40.044 --> 39:40.587
I was...

39:40.879 --> 39:41.462
spellbound.

39:41.754 --> 39:43.923
Spellbound, I tell you!

39:44.215 --> 39:45.615
I'd learned later
that it contained

39:45.758 --> 39:48.636
an ancient Sumerian
incantation of great evil.

39:48.928 --> 39:50.608
I pulled an all-nighter
on Nether Dungeon,

39:50.763 --> 39:52.015
adding the crazy new code.

39:52.307 --> 39:54.434
At some point, I must have
crashed from exhaustion.

39:54.726 --> 39:57.061
The whiskey must have dulled
the Harbinger's hold over me.

39:57.353 --> 39:58.664
Anyway, when the
hangover wore off,

39:58.688 --> 40:01.024
I realized Barton had
beta tested the game.

40:01.316 --> 40:02.358
He came under its spell.

40:02.650 --> 40:03.690
He put the factory to work

40:03.818 --> 40:06.112
mass-producing Nether
Dungeon right away.

40:06.404 --> 40:07.113
I tried to stop him,

40:07.405 --> 40:09.490
but he had controlling
interest in the company.

40:09.782 --> 40:12.063
The bastard had me removed
from the building, my building!

40:12.160 --> 40:13.160
- That is messed up!

40:13.244 --> 40:13.828
- No shite.

40:14.120 --> 40:16.873
We fought all the time,
but now, it was like he was...

40:17.165 --> 40:17.707
Possessed.

40:17.999 --> 40:18.541
- Yes!

40:18.833 --> 40:19.833
Yes!

40:21.169 --> 40:23.421
I had no idea what
controlled Barton at the time.

40:23.713 --> 40:25.840
But I'll tell you this,
I had had enough.

40:26.132 --> 40:28.801
I was full of tiger piss
and razor wire after that.

40:29.093 --> 40:30.821
I researched the symbols
in the code all night

40:30.845 --> 40:32.805
and finally discovered
what it really was after,

40:33.097 --> 40:35.433
an ancient force, a trickster,
and a player of games

40:35.725 --> 40:38.186
that harnesses its power
by besting mortal humans

40:38.478 --> 40:39.187
and claiming their souls,

40:39.479 --> 40:41.314
sucking the life
right out of them.

40:41.606 --> 40:44.233
It's challenged civilizations
throughout history

40:44.525 --> 40:46.694
for their very existence,
its power growing

40:46.986 --> 40:49.989
as humanity grew to love
and covet these games.

40:50.281 --> 40:53.242
Now, in the 21st century,
the Harbinger craves more,

40:53.534 --> 40:55.214
and with games being
played by more people,

40:55.453 --> 40:58.456
more power, greater
power, greater reach.

40:58.748 --> 41:00.601
That's why it came after
the greatest game maker

41:00.625 --> 41:01.250
of our generation.

41:01.542 --> 41:02.085
You!

41:02.377 --> 41:02.919
- Yes!

41:03.211 --> 41:04.571
The game focused
its Nether energy

41:04.671 --> 41:08.549
to controlling my creation,
boring into my genius,

41:08.841 --> 41:10.468
infecting humanity
around the globe

41:10.760 --> 41:14.722
in one massive product
release, my Nether Dungeon.

41:15.765 --> 41:17.392
Well there was
only one thing to do.

41:28.945 --> 41:30.255
Barton didn't remember
saying anything.

41:30.279 --> 41:31.279
He thought I'd lost it.

41:31.406 --> 41:33.408
Said I'd always been
jealous of his coding.

41:33.700 --> 41:35.761
He said some pretty mean
stuff that he can never take back,

41:35.785 --> 41:37.345
not that I'm keeping
score or anything.

41:37.620 --> 41:38.997
In a way...

41:39.288 --> 41:40.373
he was right.

41:40.665 --> 41:42.185
That was the end of
Wylde Child Games.

41:42.458 --> 41:44.269
I'd ruined it, burned it
to the ground like Rome.

41:44.293 --> 41:45.293
I had to.

41:45.545 --> 41:46.796
Well, Rome was burned in a day.

41:47.088 --> 41:47.630
Built.

41:47.922 --> 41:48.464
Rome wasn't built...

41:48.756 --> 41:49.298
Didn't matter.

41:49.590 --> 41:51.009
I had beat it at its own game.

41:51.300 --> 41:52.885
The was the last
time I saw Bart.

41:53.177 --> 41:54.177
I heard he...

41:54.429 --> 41:57.473
I don't know, bought an
arcade or a bar or something,

41:57.765 --> 41:59.851
raised chihuahuas,
loves avocado toast.

42:00.143 --> 42:01.383
Okay, I follow him on Facebook.

42:01.436 --> 42:02.937
But that's not the point.

42:03.229 --> 42:04.873
I knew it was only a matter
of time before the Harbinger

42:04.897 --> 42:07.275
found his one
player, his one pawn

42:07.567 --> 42:09.487
to help him spread the
Nether like peanut butter.

42:09.777 --> 42:10.319
- Oh, I'm allergic.

42:10.611 --> 42:11.154
- Noted.

42:11.446 --> 42:13.990
- The one man capable
of truly unlocking...

42:14.282 --> 42:15.282
- Me!

42:16.325 --> 42:17.493
- My boy!

42:17.785 --> 42:18.327
Chosen one!

42:18.619 --> 42:19.203
- Uh, chosen pawn.

42:19.495 --> 42:20.038
Pawn.

42:20.329 --> 42:21.724
Chosen pawn, and
we're not even sure.

42:21.748 --> 42:22.290
Maybe.

42:22.582 --> 42:23.702
- Have you guys gone mental?

42:23.791 --> 42:25.060
Do you hear
yourselves right now?

42:25.084 --> 42:27.754
This is the most convoluted
crap I have ever heard!

42:28.046 --> 42:28.588
- Skeptic.

42:28.880 --> 42:29.422
- Realist.

42:29.714 --> 42:30.256
- There's always one.

42:30.548 --> 42:31.090
- There's always...

42:31.382 --> 42:32.550
- 25 years.

42:32.842 --> 42:33.842
I knew he'd be back.

42:34.093 --> 42:36.304
I just had no idea there
were any game cartridges left.

42:36.596 --> 42:38.657
You guys are lucky I stopped
the spread of this when I did.

42:38.681 --> 42:39.724
- Guys, come on!

42:40.016 --> 42:41.517
There is no way!

42:41.809 --> 42:43.089
- How else do you explain Reggie

42:43.269 --> 42:44.812
trying to slice
and dice us, Liz?

42:45.104 --> 42:46.104
Reggie!

42:46.147 --> 42:47.291
That thing that came out of him,

42:47.315 --> 42:48.795
that was straight
up Evil Dead stuff.

42:48.941 --> 42:50.401
- Came, came out of me?

42:50.693 --> 42:51.819
What came out of me?

42:52.111 --> 42:53.404
- Spectral...

42:53.696 --> 42:54.696
energy...

42:54.947 --> 42:55.947
disruptor.

42:56.616 --> 43:00.953
100% pure unadulterated
infrared white light.

43:01.245 --> 43:03.372
Took some tinkering,
may cause weight gain.

43:03.664 --> 43:05.124
- You shot me!

43:05.416 --> 43:06.416
With that thing!

43:06.584 --> 43:07.210
- Guys, come on!

43:07.502 --> 43:08.502
Are you shitting us?

43:08.628 --> 43:10.880
- No, I am not
shitting you, little lady.

43:11.172 --> 43:12.965
Imagine hundreds
if not thousands

43:13.257 --> 43:15.377
of Nether-possessed game
junkies like your friend here

43:15.593 --> 43:18.346
just running through the
streets, running amok.

43:18.638 --> 43:19.638
- And weight gain?

43:19.889 --> 43:20.431
- Let's go!

43:20.723 --> 43:22.117
Let's go get the
game and make sure

43:22.141 --> 43:23.341
that this cannot happen again.

43:23.476 --> 43:24.018
- Hey, wait!

43:24.310 --> 43:25.370
Before you go, can I
ask you a few questions

43:25.394 --> 43:27.188
about gaming and
developing and stuff?

43:27.480 --> 43:28.480
- Uh, yes, kid.

43:28.523 --> 43:30.203
I usually require an
NDA, but in your case

43:30.233 --> 43:31.293
I'll make an exception.
- Hey, guys?

43:31.317 --> 43:32.317
- Yeah, of course.

43:32.360 --> 43:32.902
Of course, developing, coding...

43:33.194 --> 43:34.194
- Guys!

43:34.445 --> 43:35.445
What...

43:35.571 --> 43:37.615
would happen if the
game went mobile?

43:40.326 --> 43:40.910
What do you mean?

43:41.202 --> 43:42.495
- What?

43:42.787 --> 43:43.947
You kids and your cellphones.

43:43.996 --> 43:45.915
- Seth is a total ass-hat, Liz!

43:46.207 --> 43:47.708
You really know
how to pick 'em, huh?

43:48.000 --> 43:49.937
- Hey, I broke up with him
months ago, and you know that.

43:49.961 --> 43:50.586
- Hey, lovebirds...

43:50.878 --> 43:51.878
I got a date with evil.

43:51.921 --> 43:52.463
- What?

43:52.755 --> 43:53.297
No, it's not...

43:53.589 --> 43:54.132
We're not together.
- We're not dating.

43:54.423 --> 43:54.966
- Don't care.

43:55.258 --> 43:55.800
Date with evil.

43:56.092 --> 43:56.634
- Okay, where are we going?

43:56.926 --> 43:57.468
- "We" are not going anywhere.

43:57.760 --> 43:59.679
I am going to my
lair, getting my PC,

43:59.971 --> 44:01.091
and wiping this thing clean.

44:01.139 --> 44:03.158
- Well, at least let me run
some breach protocols for you.

44:03.182 --> 44:03.808
I'm really good.

44:04.100 --> 44:05.119
- Yeah, well, we can all help.

44:05.143 --> 44:06.703
I'm usually usually
just the snack guy,

44:06.727 --> 44:08.607
but I'm good at decrypting,
I'm very mechanical.

44:08.688 --> 44:09.230
- Hey!

44:09.522 --> 44:10.064
I'm a lone wolf.

44:10.356 --> 44:10.898
Al right?

44:11.190 --> 44:11.732
Go get the game!

44:12.024 --> 44:12.567
Bring it back!

44:12.859 --> 44:15.236
I will do the heavy lifting!

44:16.571 --> 44:17.571
Kid, my sword.

44:19.532 --> 44:20.533
Oh...

44:20.825 --> 44:21.868
kid...

44:22.160 --> 44:24.453
Here, take that, just in case.

44:25.913 --> 44:27.915
Nothin' beats a good
Nether blaster by your side.

44:29.542 --> 44:30.542
- Whoa, sweet.

44:31.586 --> 44:32.128
- Come on.

44:32.420 --> 44:34.046
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

44:34.338 --> 44:35.464
Come on!

44:35.756 --> 44:36.756
Come on!

44:40.178 --> 44:41.262
Hey, mechanical.

44:41.554 --> 44:42.554
You good with cars?

44:51.689 --> 44:54.609
- That's what you get when
you mess with Wildcat Jack.

45:26.390 --> 45:28.184
- Oh, hey, Gramps is
probably still asleep,

45:28.476 --> 45:29.477
SO we gotta be quiet.

45:29.769 --> 45:33.022
And sometimes he
sleepwalks naked, so...

45:33.314 --> 45:34.732
- I love watching
old people sleep.

45:35.024 --> 45:36.817
- Yeah, that's weird.

45:37.109 --> 45:38.229
- Hey, do you have any food?

45:38.361 --> 45:39.401
I didn't get to eat lunch,

45:39.612 --> 45:40.988
because someone
was late for work.

45:41.280 --> 45:42.280
- Maybe.

45:42.490 --> 45:44.575
All gramps ever makes is steak.

45:48.454 --> 45:49.747
Gramps?

45:50.039 --> 45:51.039
Gramps.

45:51.666 --> 45:52.666
Uh...

45:52.917 --> 45:53.917
Liz is here.

45:54.043 --> 45:55.062
We were just gonna
get some food,

45:55.086 --> 45:56.646
and I got a couple
errands I gotta run.

45:56.879 --> 45:57.879
Oh my god!

45:58.130 --> 45:58.714
Gramps.

45:59.006 --> 46:00.006
- Oh, no!

46:00.258 --> 46:00.883
Not again.

46:01.175 --> 46:01.717
- Gramps?

46:02.009 --> 46:03.009
Hey, it's Max.

46:03.135 --> 46:03.678
It's Max.

46:03.970 --> 46:04.637
Whoa!

46:04.929 --> 46:05.471
Wait!
- Dude, move.

46:05.763 --> 46:06.305
I got this.

46:06.597 --> 46:07.139
- Easy, easy!

46:07.431 --> 46:07.974
He has a pacemaker.

46:08.266 --> 46:09.368
The electrical ultraviolet
whatever the hell

46:09.392 --> 46:10.017
might screw it up!

46:10.309 --> 46:10.977
- Fine.

46:11.269 --> 46:11.811
- What do we do?

46:12.103 --> 46:12.770
- The iron!
- What?

46:13.062 --> 46:13.729
- Hit him, hit him with it!

46:14.021 --> 46:14.563
- What?

46:14.855 --> 46:15.398
No!

46:15.690 --> 46:16.232
- That's how they kill zombies.

46:16.524 --> 46:17.584
- I didn't want to kill him!

46:17.608 --> 46:18.150
- He's old.

46:18.442 --> 46:19.878
I don't know, just
do it like gentle.

46:19.902 --> 46:21.112
- Liz, he's a Marine.

46:21.404 --> 46:23.990
That's just gonna piss him off.

46:24.282 --> 46:25.634
- You look like you
know what you're doin'.

46:25.658 --> 46:26.658
- Yeah.

46:26.826 --> 46:27.368
I'm...

46:27.660 --> 46:28.202
pretty handy.

46:28.494 --> 46:29.734
I fixed a couple of my buddies'

46:29.870 --> 46:31.914
red ringed Xboxes, you know?

46:32.206 --> 46:33.326
It's really just the damn...

46:34.625 --> 46:35.167
- What was that?

46:35.459 --> 46:36.002
-It's...

46:36.294 --> 46:36.836
It's fine.

46:37.128 --> 46:37.670
It's totally normal.
- I'm way out of warranty!

46:37.962 --> 46:38.504
- It's totally normal.

46:38.796 --> 46:39.338
- Are you sure?

46:39.630 --> 46:40.172
- Uh-huh.

46:40.464 --> 46:41.173
- Okay, I got an ideal!

46:41.465 --> 46:42.842
Liz, distract him!

46:43.134 --> 46:44.486
- What are you
gonna do with that?

46:44.510 --> 46:45.510
- I'm gonna tie him up.

46:45.720 --> 46:47.013
- Distract him?

46:47.305 --> 46:48.472
Okay, all right.

46:48.764 --> 46:49.974
Hey, gramps.

46:50.266 --> 46:50.808
What do you think about this?

46:51.100 --> 46:52.100
- Yeah, look at that!

46:57.440 --> 46:58.440
Wait, no, Gramps!

46:58.524 --> 46:59.066
- Uh, Max?

46:59.358 --> 47:00.067
It's working.

47:00.359 --> 47:01.360
- This is so wrong!

47:01.652 --> 47:03.154
Your gramps is a perv.

47:04.905 --> 47:05.448
- Okay.

47:05.740 --> 47:06.282
I got him.

47:06.574 --> 47:07.116
Liz, help me get
him somewhere safe,

47:07.408 --> 47:09.535
where he can't hurt anybody.

47:12.496 --> 47:13.496
Well...

47:14.415 --> 47:15.583
that was close.

47:16.751 --> 47:17.418
Good teamwork.

47:17.710 --> 47:19.003
- Yeah.

47:19.295 --> 47:20.295
Hey...

47:20.338 --> 47:23.883
how did Gramps get
exposed to Nether Dungeon?

47:25.551 --> 47:26.903
- Well it looks
like your boyfriend

47:26.927 --> 47:28.512
jacked my mailing list, too.

47:28.804 --> 47:30.598
- He's not my boyfriend!

47:32.183 --> 47:33.660
- Let's just get the
game and get back.

47:33.684 --> 47:34.977
We gotta fix this.

47:40.733 --> 47:42.026
Seth.

47:47.031 --> 47:48.551
- This is a stainless
steel appliance.

47:48.741 --> 47:50.409
It is not supposed to burn!

47:54.538 --> 47:55.538
No!

47:56.165 --> 47:57.165
Come on!

47:58.584 --> 47:59.585
- That escalated quickly.

47:59.877 --> 48:00.419
- You know what?

48:00.711 --> 48:01.253
You're not as
mechanical as you think.

48:01.545 --> 48:02.963
- Okay, I'm better
at the snacks.

48:03.255 --> 48:04.255
Okay?

48:04.298 --> 48:05.007
- What's this now?

48:05.299 --> 48:05.841
- Oh, boy.

48:06.133 --> 48:07.635
- Who wants to play a game?

48:07.927 --> 48:09.303
- Is that a friend of yours?

48:09.595 --> 48:10.137
- We used to be friends.

48:10.429 --> 48:11.698
You know, in
elementary school, but ..

48:11.722 --> 48:13.766
Life happens, we grew apart.

48:14.058 --> 48:15.101
- What is that?

48:15.393 --> 48:16.393
- Jai alai!

48:17.395 --> 48:20.523
Only the fastest
sport in the world.

48:20.815 --> 48:23.150
Tech school doesn't have a
lot of sports to choose from.

48:23.442 --> 48:24.442
- Okay!

48:24.568 --> 48:28.864
Denting an uninsured classic
is not a game, my friend!

48:29.824 --> 48:30.824
Ha ha!

48:35.579 --> 48:36.914
Not now, not now.

48:38.290 --> 48:39.750
Hey, mechanical...

48:40.042 --> 48:41.082
take a quick look at this.

48:41.252 --> 48:42.252
-Uh ..

48:42.336 --> 48:42.878
Okay.

48:43.170 --> 48:44.170
Um...

48:48.300 --> 48:49.300
Oh.

48:49.552 --> 48:50.552
I got nothin'.

48:53.097 --> 48:54.473
- The Nether has been released.

48:54.765 --> 48:56.434
And congratulations, you two

48:56.725 --> 48:58.519
will be among the
first of the new order.

48:58.811 --> 48:59.937
- Seth, can't we just...

49:00.229 --> 49:01.814
you know, talk about this?

49:02.106 --> 49:05.151
I like games, you like
games. we like games.

49:05.443 --> 49:07.083
I don't like this
game right now, but...

49:07.194 --> 49:08.320
Oh, hey, back!

49:08.612 --> 49:09.280
Stay back!

49:09.572 --> 49:11.991
- The Doom Bringer has won.

49:12.283 --> 49:15.411
You have fulfilled your
purpose at last, Game Maker.

49:15.703 --> 49:18.747
Power grows with each
could committed to the game,

49:19.039 --> 49:20.583
committed to the Nether!

49:20.875 --> 49:23.752
The chosen one
will shift the tide.

49:24.044 --> 49:25.504
Now where is he?

49:25.796 --> 49:26.922
- I'll tell you.

49:27.882 --> 49:28.882
Boom.

49:29.008 --> 49:30.217
- What?

49:30.509 --> 49:31.093
- Boom.

49:31.385 --> 49:32.385
High score.

49:40.102 --> 49:41.353
- How could you?

49:45.900 --> 49:46.442
- You good?

49:46.734 --> 49:47.276
- They milked me, Max.

49:47.568 --> 49:48.568
They milked me.

49:48.694 --> 49:50.070
- Oh, that was good, Lizzy.

49:50.362 --> 49:51.572
That was good.

49:51.864 --> 49:53.657
- Level completed!

49:53.949 --> 49:54.949
Ha ha!

49:54.992 --> 49:56.887
- You know, that reminds me
why I dumped your ass, Lizzy.

49:56.911 --> 49:58.120
Your shit is weak!

49:58.412 --> 49:59.497
- Shit blood, Seth!

49:59.788 --> 50:00.956
You never deserved her.

50:01.248 --> 50:01.790
Okay?

50:02.082 --> 50:03.334
You dick weasel!

50:03.626 --> 50:04.835
- Dick weasel?

50:05.127 --> 50:06.712
- These tool bags
are like mini-bosses.

50:07.004 --> 50:08.797
Just blast the
shit out of 'em, Liz.

50:12.801 --> 50:13.802
- Eugene?

50:14.094 --> 50:14.803
It's not working.

50:15.095 --> 50:15.638
- Right.

50:15.930 --> 50:16.930
Uh...

50:17.097 --> 50:18.641
The power's...

50:18.933 --> 50:19.558
running low.

50:19.850 --> 50:21.477
- Yeah, no shit.

50:21.769 --> 50:22.311
- You know, I got this.

50:22.603 --> 50:25.064
It's been a while,
but I think I got it.

50:35.157 --> 50:36.450
- What's he doing?

50:36.742 --> 50:38.619
- Is he speaking Klingon?

50:40.371 --> 50:42.665
- Cease thy Nether
portal prolapse,

50:42.957 --> 50:45.417
shatting on thy Earth you craps!

50:46.335 --> 50:47.586
Be gone, you...

50:49.463 --> 50:50.631
fiends perhaps!

50:53.759 --> 50:54.759
Perhaps!

50:56.720 --> 50:57.822
I don't know what's going on.

50:57.846 --> 50:58.846
I did everything.

50:59.515 --> 51:00.515
- You fool.

51:00.766 --> 51:04.186
The Doom Bringer is the
Alpha, the Beta, and the Omega.

51:04.478 --> 51:06.038
Your little game was
merely the balance

51:06.146 --> 51:07.231
that binds in between.

51:07.523 --> 51:08.523
That relic...

51:10.985 --> 51:14.905
merely the key to unlocking
the door between our worlds.

51:15.197 --> 51:18.158
You are the prize
we seek now, Max!

51:18.450 --> 51:21.745
You are the knight in our
armies, we conquer this Earth,

51:22.037 --> 51:24.790
not a mere pawn
like the rest of them.

51:25.082 --> 51:26.292
Join us.

51:26.584 --> 51:29.336
Because a speedy
victory is ours.

51:29.628 --> 51:31.338
We cannot be
stopped now that we...

51:33.632 --> 51:34.632
- No!

51:37.136 --> 51:37.845
Steve!

51:38.137 --> 51:39.388
- Oh my god!

51:39.680 --> 51:40.782
Wait, who's Steve?

51:40.806 --> 51:41.974
- Oh god, not again.

51:42.266 --> 51:42.975
- He's the delivery guy.

51:43.267 --> 51:44.393
He's so hot

51:44.685 --> 51:45.685
- Steve!

51:46.604 --> 51:48.439
- What's goin' on, guys?

51:48.731 --> 51:50.149
Oh, that's not right.

51:50.441 --> 51:51.921
We have to get to my lair.

51:52.151 --> 51:53.920
- Steve, sweetie, we need
you to give us a ride, okay?

51:53.944 --> 51:54.944
And don't ask questions.

51:55.112 --> 51:56.832
Can you just drive,
safely, can you do that?

51:57.072 --> 51:57.615
- Yeah, yeah.

51:57.906 --> 51:59.658
- All right, we gotta go now.

51:59.950 --> 52:00.492
- Okay.

52:00.784 --> 52:01.952
Oh my god!

52:13.297 --> 52:14.417
- It's reached critical mass

52:14.465 --> 52:15.650
for the first wave of the spell.

52:15.674 --> 52:16.925
- What's that mean?

52:17.217 --> 52:19.017
- It means enough people
have played the game,

52:19.303 --> 52:20.383
been exposed to the Nether.

52:20.596 --> 52:21.676
Anybody plays the game now,

52:21.764 --> 52:23.599
they're instantly
controlled by it.

52:23.891 --> 52:24.433
- Oh, shit.

52:24.725 --> 52:25.392
- Luckily, though...

52:25.684 --> 52:27.245
Looks like these
noobs have dedicated it

52:27.269 --> 52:28.913
to the school server when
they went mobile with it,

52:28.937 --> 52:31.774
and, unlike you, they've
encrypted it and firewalled it.

52:32.066 --> 52:33.817
Although, it looks
like it's on a slow drip.

52:34.109 --> 52:36.487
My game should be
much more popular.

52:36.779 --> 52:38.219
- Your game's
older than dirt, dude.

52:38.447 --> 52:40.240
I'm surprised people
are even playing it.

52:40.532 --> 52:41.784
- I'm sorry...

52:42.076 --> 52:44.328
Could you allow yourself
at least a dollop of respect

52:44.620 --> 52:45.620
for the analog superhero

52:45.871 --> 52:47.349
you're currently
sharing this van with?

52:47.373 --> 52:49.083
Excuse moi.

52:49.375 --> 52:50.375
- Guys...

52:50.918 --> 52:51.918
look.

52:57.049 --> 52:58.049
- See?

52:58.217 --> 52:59.760
It is pretty popular.

53:30.249 --> 53:31.250
- Okay, shh, shh, shh.

53:31.542 --> 53:33.627
Guys, guys, my girlfriend's
an underwear model,

53:33.919 --> 53:35.671
and she's got an early
shoot in the morning.

53:35.963 --> 53:36.505
Come on in.

53:36.797 --> 53:37.339
Shh, be quiet.

53:37.631 --> 53:38.340
I don't wanna wake her.

53:38.632 --> 53:39.632
Excuse me.

53:40.634 --> 53:42.094
Eugene?

53:42.386 --> 53:43.386
Is that you?

53:45.723 --> 53:46.890
Oh...

53:47.182 --> 53:48.892
Geno, my magical genie.

53:49.810 --> 53:50.810
Oh!

53:51.812 --> 53:52.855
Look who's here!

53:53.147 --> 53:54.356
Mr. Shnoops!

53:54.648 --> 53:55.768
He wants to give you a kiss.

53:55.899 --> 53:56.567
- Oh, no he doesn't.

53:56.859 --> 53:57.859
- Oh, hello.

53:57.943 --> 53:58.943
Okay.

53:59.194 --> 54:00.195
- We share him.

54:00.487 --> 54:01.487
- Okay.

54:02.114 --> 54:03.794
Are these your study group?

54:03.824 --> 54:04.908
- Yes, they are, yes.

54:05.200 --> 54:06.744
We're actually
in class together.

54:07.035 --> 54:08.912
- Oh, that is so nice.

54:09.204 --> 54:09.747
So nice.

54:10.038 --> 54:12.708
I don't usually get to meet
Geno's friends very often.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.000
So...

54:14.084 --> 54:15.252
well...

54:15.544 --> 54:17.004
Come on, well...

54:17.296 --> 54:17.963
give me the beans.

54:18.255 --> 54:19.506
What's happening?

54:19.798 --> 54:20.340
-Um...

54:20.632 --> 54:21.717
- Just...

54:22.009 --> 54:24.470
playing video games,
Eugene's mom.

54:24.762 --> 54:25.762
- Oh.

54:25.929 --> 54:26.929
Of course.

54:27.514 --> 54:30.309
He could've been a lawyer.

54:30.601 --> 54:32.060
But it's the gaming.

54:37.024 --> 54:39.026
Just glory-seeking noobs.

54:42.196 --> 54:43.196
Well...

54:44.281 --> 54:45.908
winner, winner, chicken dinner.

54:46.200 --> 54:48.702
Who's gonna be the winner?

54:48.994 --> 54:51.121
Would you like to have a snack?

54:51.413 --> 54:52.413
- Yes!

54:54.625 --> 54:56.168
If it's already made.

54:56.460 --> 54:57.002
- Why don't you go back go bed?

54:57.294 --> 54:58.897
It's late, and I didn't
mean to wake you.

54:58.921 --> 54:59.505
We were just...

54:59.797 --> 55:00.339
- No, no.

55:00.631 --> 55:03.425
I am already awake, so you
make yourself comfortable,

55:03.717 --> 55:05.844
and I am going to make a snack.

55:06.136 --> 55:06.678
Okay.

55:06.970 --> 55:08.639
- It's nice to meet you all.

55:08.931 --> 55:09.640
- Do it quietly.

55:09.932 --> 55:12.184
We don't want to
wake up Katarina.

55:12.476 --> 55:13.101
Who?

55:13.393 --> 55:13.936
- Nothing.

55:14.228 --> 55:15.604
Let's go sit down.

55:15.896 --> 55:16.896
- Genie?

55:17.105 --> 55:20.400
I made these balls
extra juicy just for you.

55:27.699 --> 55:29.701
Boom, boom, high score.

55:29.993 --> 55:31.453
- Thank you, Mrs. W.

55:31.745 --> 55:32.745
- Really great.

55:32.996 --> 55:33.997
Thanks, Eugene's mom.

55:34.289 --> 55:35.289
- You're welcome.

55:35.541 --> 55:37.084
- Are there bread
crumbs in these?

55:37.376 --> 55:38.794
I'm on a low-carb thing.

55:39.086 --> 55:40.086
- Yes.

55:41.338 --> 55:43.757
- All right, just for tonight.

55:46.343 --> 55:47.343
- Okay.

55:47.511 --> 55:48.637
Appreciate it.

55:48.929 --> 55:50.055
- I'm going to bed.

55:50.347 --> 55:51.640
- Good.

55:51.932 --> 55:53.201
Don't stay up too late.

55:53.225 --> 55:54.225
Nope.

55:54.268 --> 55:55.769
- And, Genie?

55:56.061 --> 55:57.061
Yup.

55:57.104 --> 55:57.729
- Brush your teeth.

55:58.021 --> 55:59.021
- Okay, Mom.

55:59.189 --> 56:01.316
- With the strong toothpaste.

56:01.608 --> 56:03.026
- Love you.

56:03.318 --> 56:04.318
- No fragging.

56:17.249 --> 56:18.876
- Okay, shall we?

56:28.594 --> 56:30.053
- Dude, this is so rad!

56:30.345 --> 56:31.471
Your setup's insane!

56:31.763 --> 56:33.974
- Despite the fact that
it's in your mom's garage.

56:34.266 --> 56:35.266
- Yeah, it's...

56:35.434 --> 56:36.894
It's actually mirrored...

56:37.185 --> 56:40.314
so that I can go from one
battle station to the next,

56:40.606 --> 56:42.941
the way we used to do it
back in the day, me and Barton.

56:43.233 --> 56:43.775
Oh, can you please...

56:44.067 --> 56:44.610
I'm sorry, can you please...

56:44.902 --> 56:45.444
Don't, don't...

56:45.736 --> 56:46.278
Hey!

56:46.570 --> 56:47.112
Guys, don't...

56:47.404 --> 56:48.404
Put that down!

56:50.657 --> 56:51.283
I'm sorry.

56:51.575 --> 56:53.255
You're the first
civvies that I've allowed

56:53.452 --> 56:55.370
into Wylde Child 2.0, so...

56:55.662 --> 56:56.662
Thank you.

56:57.247 --> 56:59.416
- Shocking he's still single.

56:59.708 --> 57:00.708
- He's off the grid.

57:00.959 --> 57:03.337
He has a secret garage lair.

57:03.629 --> 57:05.088
- Yeah, I am off the grid.

57:05.380 --> 57:06.500
Way off the grid.

57:06.673 --> 57:07.673
Kinda went Red Dawn.

57:07.925 --> 57:10.802
And after Wylde Child
Games, I invested

57:11.094 --> 57:14.181
in a few other gaming companies
and some MMO servers.

57:14.473 --> 57:16.224
I still moderate,
watching out for players

57:16.516 --> 57:18.143
that the Nether
might be targeting.

57:18.435 --> 57:20.315
Could call me the game
god, the wizard of games.

57:20.604 --> 57:22.606
Some refer to me as...

57:22.898 --> 57:23.941
the MMO wizard.

57:24.983 --> 57:26.360
- The Wizard.

57:26.652 --> 57:28.338
- You're that guy that
steals all of our loot?

57:28.362 --> 57:30.072
- You are the MMO Wizard?

57:30.364 --> 57:30.989
- Yes.

57:31.281 --> 57:32.961
But you're lucky I have
been watching you,

57:33.075 --> 57:34.993
because the Nether
saw its prime opportunity

57:35.285 --> 57:37.788
to finally play
out its best hand.

57:38.080 --> 57:39.623
And I found you, kid.

57:40.540 --> 57:41.792
- Well, you know what?

57:42.084 --> 57:44.503
Then it's up to us to stop it.

57:44.795 --> 57:46.230
- No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

57:46.254 --> 57:47.254
There is no us.

57:47.339 --> 57:47.881
Okay?

57:48.173 --> 57:49.453
There is no us, there's no team.

57:49.633 --> 57:51.385
This is me dealing
with your shit show,

57:51.677 --> 57:53.529
and I'm just gonna flush
it down the golden toilet

57:53.553 --> 57:55.281
and be done with it, and
you guys will be on your way.

57:55.305 --> 57:56.305
I just need a moment.

57:56.390 --> 57:56.932
- Well at least let me run

57:57.224 --> 57:58.409
some fort protocols
to cover your back.

57:58.433 --> 57:58.976
- No!

57:59.267 --> 57:59.810
Please.

58:00.102 --> 58:00.644
I can do this alone.

58:00.936 --> 58:01.478
Don't touch.

58:01.770 --> 58:03.146
Please don't touch.

58:04.606 --> 58:05.774
- Okay, but Eugene, you see

58:06.066 --> 58:07.210
that thing that
you're doing there?

58:07.234 --> 58:09.444
There's a more efficient
way to run that script.

58:09.736 --> 58:10.946
- I'm sure there is.

58:11.238 --> 58:13.949
However, this is
the way I do this.

58:15.283 --> 58:15.951
Check this out.

58:16.243 --> 58:16.785
I'm just gonna go over here.

58:17.077 --> 58:17.619
No, I see what you're doing.

58:17.911 --> 58:18.453
Yup.

58:18.745 --> 58:19.329
- I see what you're doing,
but look, you forgot to...

58:19.621 --> 58:20.861
- What, lay down a fire escape?

58:21.081 --> 58:22.207
I'm ahead of you.

58:22.499 --> 58:23.819
Okay, stop!
- What are they doing?

58:24.084 --> 58:25.127
- Flexing mind muscles.

58:25.419 --> 58:27.629
It's like a rap battle
but for hackers.

58:27.921 --> 58:30.090
- It's like a
wizards duel but...

58:30.382 --> 58:31.675
it's even nerdier.

58:31.967 --> 58:32.509
- Right.

58:32.801 --> 58:33.468
Flexing.

58:33.760 --> 58:34.302
Yes!

58:34.594 --> 58:35.804
I get it.

58:36.096 --> 58:37.576
- No, no, you're
leaving breadcrumbs.

58:37.639 --> 58:38.639
Breadcrumbs.

58:39.683 --> 58:40.683
- Eugene, okay.

58:40.851 --> 58:43.186
See, that, that is
so last month, dude.

58:43.478 --> 58:44.478
Watch this.

58:46.440 --> 58:48.080
Sorry, had to disconnect
you for a second

58:48.358 --> 58:50.485
while I reroute
this bypass kernel.

58:54.239 --> 58:55.240
And...

58:55.532 --> 58:56.199
Bam!

58:56.491 --> 58:57.491
Done, son!

58:57.617 --> 58:59.453
How's that for teaching
an old dog new tricks?

58:59.745 --> 59:00.745
Ha ha!

59:01.997 --> 59:03.749
Max Reload in the house!

59:04.041 --> 59:05.459
"Ah, Max, you're so go great!"

59:05.751 --> 59:07.031
"Oh, I know, thank you so much."

59:07.961 --> 59:09.188
- Please tell me that
you shielded the breach

59:09.212 --> 59:11.548
with a DNS and IP
encryption so that the bots

59:11.840 --> 59:14.551
wouldn't detect
the reroute source.

59:15.677 --> 59:20.098
- I thought you would
have done that off the top.

59:29.900 --> 59:30.984
- No, no, no, no, no!

59:31.276 --> 59:31.818
You did this.

59:32.110 --> 59:33.653
You did this.

59:33.945 --> 59:37.032
You know what young pups
do that old dogs don't do?

59:37.324 --> 59:38.325
Eat their own poo!

59:38.617 --> 59:39.159
- What?

59:39.451 --> 59:40.451
How is this my fault?

59:40.494 --> 59:42.574
How was I supposed to
know that it was gonna do that?

59:42.788 --> 59:44.414
- Because you coulda listened!

59:44.706 --> 59:45.706
Just listen!

59:45.916 --> 59:47.876
I've been preparing for
this moment my whole life.

59:47.918 --> 59:48.460
- Oh!

59:48.752 --> 59:50.438
You mean the ancient
evil that you unleashed

59:50.462 --> 59:52.106
because you couldn't
hack it back in the day?

59:52.130 --> 59:52.672
- You guys!

59:52.964 --> 59:53.964
Seriously!

59:54.216 --> 59:55.342
Eugene, what does it mean?

59:55.634 --> 59:56.634
What's next?

01:00:02.682 --> 01:00:03.722
- That doesn't sound good.

01:00:03.975 --> 01:00:05.644
- It's reached enough
gamers to level up.

01:00:05.936 --> 01:00:08.522
The Nether is one step
closer to total control.

01:00:11.066 --> 01:00:15.695
And now it knows exactly
where we are, thanks to you, Max.

01:00:16.738 --> 01:00:17.948
- You're bailing?

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:19.282
Really?

01:00:19.574 --> 01:00:20.242
How fitting.

01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:21.076
- Yup.

01:00:21.368 --> 01:00:23.703
Someone has to get
rid of these hard drives.

01:00:23.995 --> 01:00:24.704
Good luck to you guys.

01:00:24.996 --> 01:00:25.996
You're gonna need it.

01:00:26.248 --> 01:00:26.957
- You're just pissed it chose me

01:00:27.249 --> 01:00:29.626
and used you as the
pawn all these years.

01:00:29.918 --> 01:00:31.598
- You better watch
your words, little man.

01:00:31.878 --> 01:00:32.878
- You heard 'em.

01:00:33.004 --> 01:00:34.256
I'm the chosen player.

01:00:34.548 --> 01:00:36.317
You're just pissed off
that you spent your whole

01:00:36.341 --> 01:00:38.969
sad little life pretending it
was you who was so important.

01:00:39.261 --> 01:00:40.261
Eugene, wow.

01:00:41.096 --> 01:00:42.514
Look at you now.

01:00:42.806 --> 01:00:43.806
Rage quitting?

01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:46.893
- You know you're all talk?

01:00:47.185 --> 01:00:48.436
Huh?

01:00:48.728 --> 01:00:51.439
What have you ever created
that's gonna last forever?

01:00:51.731 --> 01:00:52.816
Hm?

01:00:53.108 --> 01:00:55.277
You're a single player, Max.

01:00:55.569 --> 01:00:57.696
Always have been,
always will be.

01:00:57.988 --> 01:00:58.697
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:00:58.989 --> 01:01:03.160
- At least I am not some
washed-up has-been.

01:01:03.451 --> 01:01:04.571
- What did you just call me?

01:01:04.828 --> 01:01:05.868
- Oh, did you not hear me?

01:01:06.121 --> 01:01:08.290
Maybe you should turn up
your hearing aid, old man!

01:01:08.582 --> 01:01:09.291
- He said at least you're not...

01:01:09.583 --> 01:01:10.125
- Sone of a...

01:01:10.417 --> 01:01:11.417
- What, what?

01:01:12.085 --> 01:01:12.627
- Guys, stop!

01:01:12.919 --> 01:01:13.461
Stop!

01:01:13.753 --> 01:01:14.296
- We're on the same team!

01:01:14.588 --> 01:01:15.588
All talk?

01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:16.381
All talk?

01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:17.215
- Yeah!

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:18.216
- How's this for all talk?

01:01:18.508 --> 01:01:19.676
- Shotokan block!

01:01:19.968 --> 01:01:20.635
Oh, shit!

01:01:20.927 --> 01:01:22.179
Fuck, Max!

01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:23.555
- Sorry, guys.

01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:24.847
Training kicked in.

01:01:24.973 --> 01:01:25.640
- Liz, I'm so sorry.

01:01:25.932 --> 01:01:26.932
Let me see.

01:01:27.058 --> 01:01:30.645
- You two morons are
so alike, you know that?

01:01:30.937 --> 01:01:34.232
You both think that you're
the center of the universe.

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:39.070
You deserve to be lone wolves,
together, alone, whatever.

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:42.699
I don't even know
why I like you so much.

01:01:42.991 --> 01:01:44.284
- Wait, like me, like me?

01:01:44.576 --> 01:01:46.296
How was I supposed to
know that you like me?

01:01:46.411 --> 01:01:48.163
You're always being
so critical of me.

01:01:48.455 --> 01:01:50.215
I just figured you date
idiots and meatheads.

01:01:50.248 --> 01:01:51.958
What?

01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:53.978
- It's your fault that
we got started in this!

01:01:54.002 --> 01:01:56.296
Your boy toy Seth has
such a hard-on for me.

01:01:56.588 --> 01:02:00.091
- Oh, it's always someone
else's fault, isn't it, Max?

01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:01.583
Why do you think I dumped him?

01:02:01.801 --> 01:02:03.220
The only reason I ever dated him

01:02:03.511 --> 01:02:05.972
was to make you jealous and
to get you to do something?

01:02:06.264 --> 01:02:06.806
- Hey, uh, guys?

01:02:07.098 --> 01:02:07.641
- Jesus, Max.

01:02:07.933 --> 01:02:10.560
You are so into
being you that...

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:13.188
you don't even
know what's going on.

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:14.189
- What does that mean?

01:02:14.481 --> 01:02:15.774
- Guys!

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:17.275
We've got company.

01:02:20.111 --> 01:02:21.111
- Mama!

01:03:12.956 --> 01:03:13.956
Ma!

01:03:16.501 --> 01:03:18.753
- We've come for the player.

01:03:19.713 --> 01:03:21.548
And your list of
slaves, Game Maker.

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:23.717
- My master player email list.

01:03:24.009 --> 01:03:25.176
- Get 'em, boy.

01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:27.929
- Oh, let's dance Nether biotch!

01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:29.389
Come on!

01:03:33.226 --> 01:03:34.728
- Well, well, well.

01:03:36.438 --> 01:03:37.897
How quaint is this?

01:03:38.189 --> 01:03:39.816
Developers in a garage.

01:03:40.108 --> 01:03:41.526
- Max, what do we do?

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:44.029
"Max, what do we do?"

01:03:44.321 --> 01:03:45.321
- I got this.

01:03:45.363 --> 01:03:45.947
- Ooh.

01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:47.949
- Step up, bros!

01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:49.576
- Oh yeah, get him, boy.

01:03:49.868 --> 01:03:50.868
Sick him!

01:03:51.953 --> 01:03:52.953
- Steve!

01:03:53.872 --> 01:03:54.873
Max, do something!

01:03:55.165 --> 01:03:56.291
- Yeah, eat him!

01:03:57.334 --> 01:03:59.252
- Holy shit!
- Holy Shit!

01:04:01.171 --> 01:04:02.505
- It's game over, Max.

01:04:02.797 --> 01:04:03.858
Okay, we've become too strong.

01:04:03.882 --> 01:04:05.258
Now give in...

01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:06.676
and join us now.

01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:11.848
- Stop 'em!

01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:13.140
My email list!

01:04:14.225 --> 01:04:16.770
The force vortex button!

01:04:17.062 --> 01:04:18.146
- Stop them!

01:04:18.438 --> 01:04:20.231
For Steve!

01:04:36.414 --> 01:04:38.792
Genie, is everything
okay in there?

01:04:39.084 --> 01:04:41.169
What are you doing?

01:04:41.461 --> 01:04:42.461
What are you doing?

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:44.214
I hear a racket.

01:04:44.506 --> 01:04:47.050
Genie, are you kids
rough-housing in there?

01:04:47.342 --> 01:04:49.052
- All good, Ma.

01:04:49.344 --> 01:04:51.137
Everything's just dandy.

01:04:58.436 --> 01:04:59.938
It's totally fubar.

01:05:02.690 --> 01:05:04.984
20 years of gamer tags.

01:05:05.276 --> 01:05:06.276
Gone.

01:05:07.237 --> 01:05:08.237
You know what?

01:05:08.488 --> 01:05:09.507
I'm gonna take
Ma down to Mexico,

01:05:09.531 --> 01:05:11.491
and we'll just sit on the beach,

01:05:11.783 --> 01:05:14.828
drink margaritas,
watch the world burn.

01:05:16.454 --> 01:05:17.914
I mean, what else can I do?

01:05:18.206 --> 01:05:19.582
I'm just one coder.

01:05:20.625 --> 01:05:22.127
- That's really it?

01:05:23.461 --> 01:05:24.921
You're just gonna give up?

01:05:25.213 --> 01:05:26.213
We gotta stop this thing.

01:05:26.297 --> 01:05:27.757
You said so.

01:05:28.049 --> 01:05:28.591
What?

01:05:28.883 --> 01:05:29.467
It's got Gramps!

01:05:29.759 --> 01:05:31.010
It whacked Steve!

01:05:31.302 --> 01:05:33.012
Come on, all those
people out there!

01:05:33.304 --> 01:05:36.599
- At this point, Max, we would
need to original game code,

01:05:36.891 --> 01:05:38.251
and we would need
weapons and tech

01:05:38.518 --> 01:05:40.812
if we're gonna fight
this thing at the source.

01:05:41.104 --> 01:05:42.605
- You're a quitter.

01:05:42.897 --> 01:05:45.066
You're a camper and a quitter.

01:05:45.358 --> 01:05:46.568
- Oh, here we go again.

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:49.988
- Do you ever think
anything through?

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:51.280
Huh?

01:05:51.489 --> 01:05:54.576
Or do you just shoot first
and ask questions later?

01:05:54.868 --> 01:05:58.329
In the words of the
immortal Bill Paxton...

01:06:00.206 --> 01:06:01.791
it's game over, man.

01:06:03.877 --> 01:06:04.877
Game...

01:06:06.171 --> 01:06:07.171
over.

01:06:09.382 --> 01:06:10.049
- Guys.

01:06:10.341 --> 01:06:10.884
Guys, come on.

01:06:11.176 --> 01:06:11.718
We gotta do something.

01:06:12.010 --> 01:06:12.552
Okay?

01:06:12.844 --> 01:06:14.280
I don't know what, but
we gotta storm the castle.

01:06:14.304 --> 01:06:14.846
Come on.

01:06:15.138 --> 01:06:16.681
Who's with me?

01:06:16.973 --> 01:06:17.973
Come on!

01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:21.311
Fine.

01:06:21.603 --> 01:06:22.145
Fine.

01:06:22.437 --> 01:06:24.731
I've always played
better solo anyways.

01:06:43.333 --> 01:06:44.417
Where you goin'?

01:06:44.709 --> 01:06:46.002
- Not now, Reggie.

01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:53.300
- What is this, dude?

01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:57.055
Just another Max Jenkins
solo suicide mission?

01:06:58.348 --> 01:07:01.142
I know that you don't need
me to go with you, Max.

01:07:01.434 --> 01:07:04.979
You're better than
me at about everything.

01:07:05.271 --> 01:07:09.692
But I've always been
there, and I'm good at that.

01:07:09.984 --> 01:07:12.320
I just wish, dude,
that you'd realize

01:07:12.612 --> 01:07:14.322
you're not always flying solo.

01:07:14.614 --> 01:07:18.493
So who cares what Eugene
Wylder has to think about you?

01:07:18.785 --> 01:07:20.161
You make rad stuff.

01:07:21.579 --> 01:07:22.872
- Jesus, Reg.

01:07:23.164 --> 01:07:26.251
Where's this pep
talk comin' from?

01:07:26.543 --> 01:07:27.743
- Maybe you just don't listen.

01:07:27.961 --> 01:07:31.923
I mean, we're proud that
you're from our shitty little tribe

01:07:32.215 --> 01:07:34.384
and that you're one of us.

01:07:34.676 --> 01:07:36.970
Know that you're gonna
do something big someday.

01:07:37.262 --> 01:07:41.558
Otherwise, why would put
up with all your shit, right?

01:07:44.227 --> 01:07:46.980
Listen, Liz told
me about Gramps.

01:07:47.272 --> 01:07:48.982
And we're a clan, dude.

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:51.377
So we're gonna
have to stick together

01:07:51.401 --> 01:07:54.112
if we're gonna save anybody.

01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:55.404
Everybody.

01:07:58.241 --> 01:07:59.701
- Liz hate me now?

01:07:59.993 --> 01:08:02.954
- She's pissed at
you again, as usual.

01:08:03.955 --> 01:08:07.208
She's patching up Eugene,
trying to convince him to stay.

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:09.210
But, dude, she's right.

01:08:11.087 --> 01:08:13.006
You two are a lot alike.

01:08:14.507 --> 01:08:17.260
We gotta figure this
out together, Frodo.

01:08:17.551 --> 01:08:18.551
You gotta trust me.

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:20.013
I'm your Samwise.

01:08:20.305 --> 01:08:21.764
I'm Goose to your Maverick.

01:08:22.055 --> 01:08:23.057
- No.

01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:24.349
Goose dies.

01:08:25.143 --> 01:08:26.143
- Oh, right.

01:08:26.394 --> 01:08:27.394
I'm not Goose.

01:08:27.562 --> 01:08:28.562
- Ice Man.

01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:30.982
You can be Val
Kilmer, pre Bat nips.

01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:34.109
- I love the Bat nips, though.

01:08:34.402 --> 01:08:36.237
- Dude, you're an
awesome Samwise,

01:08:36.529 --> 01:08:38.406
and you do a lot of
stuff better than me,

01:08:38.698 --> 01:08:40.178
like actually thinking
things through

01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:43.453
and not being an
asshole all the time.

01:08:43.745 --> 01:08:45.830
And honestly, Frodo
would kinda be spider shit

01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:47.497
without Samwise,
and he knows it.

01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:48.790
- See?

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Right there.

01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:50.667
Okay?

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:54.505
Lord of the Rings,
Ghostbusters, the Mighty Ducks.

01:08:54.796 --> 01:08:56.317
They all relied on
each other in order

01:08:56.549 --> 01:08:58.384
to succeed against
a greater evil.

01:08:58.676 --> 01:09:00.345
- You did not just
cite the Mighty Ducks.

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:01.636
- You bet your ass I did.

01:09:01.804 --> 01:09:03.430
That is Emilio's best work.

01:09:03.723 --> 01:09:05.308
It's a lovely film.

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:07.435
- All right, if we're
gonna do this,

01:09:07.727 --> 01:09:09.687
we gotta work
together, all or nothing.

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:13.941
- Partners in this weird,
absurd, epic quest, yes.

01:09:21.908 --> 01:09:22.908
- Partners?

01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:41.009
Hello?

01:09:41.301 --> 01:09:44.138
We're looking for
Barton Grabowski!

01:09:45.264 --> 01:09:47.183
- We found your game!

01:09:47.475 --> 01:09:48.518
Nether Dungeon.

01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:51.062
- And Eugene!

01:09:53.648 --> 01:09:55.525
- Every couple of years,

01:09:55.817 --> 01:09:58.986
some geeks come in here
looking for that damn game.

01:10:03.074 --> 01:10:05.159
- Sorry to disappoint you,

01:10:06.411 --> 01:10:10.623
but every copy of that
game went up in smoke.

01:10:10.915 --> 01:10:11.915
Literally.

01:10:13.459 --> 01:10:15.878
Everything else, including
my partner's career,

01:10:16.170 --> 01:10:18.548
well that went
up his nose, so...

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:19.840
game over.

01:10:19.882 --> 01:10:20.882
You guys can go.

01:10:20.925 --> 01:10:21.467
- Wait.

01:10:21.759 --> 01:10:22.301
There's more to the story.

01:10:22.593 --> 01:10:23.219
Eugene told us everything.

01:10:23.511 --> 01:10:24.637
You both got screwed.

01:10:24.929 --> 01:10:26.389
Just let us explain.

01:10:30.184 --> 01:10:31.184
- Okay.

01:10:32.228 --> 01:10:33.688
You have five minutes.

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:37.775
Or until I get bored,
which is already happening.

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:39.067
Go.

01:10:39.193 --> 01:10:40.793
- And then I hit the
force vortex button

01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:42.220
and fried all of
Eugene's computer.

01:10:42.488 --> 01:10:43.799
- Yeah, so the guy
with the micropenis,

01:10:43.823 --> 01:10:45.700
he basically dissolved
with the Nether Kraken,

01:10:45.992 --> 01:10:47.511
but they got the email
list for all the players.

01:10:47.535 --> 01:10:50.371
- And then, Eugene
and I kinda got into it.

01:10:50.663 --> 01:10:52.498
Said some pretty
mean shit to each other.

01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:54.000
It got ugly.

01:10:54.292 --> 01:10:55.752
- And you punched
Liz in the face.

01:10:56.043 --> 01:10:58.296
- Well, I was aiming for Eugene.

01:10:58.588 --> 01:10:59.839
- I've done that.

01:11:00.131 --> 01:11:03.718
- So, long story long, the
fellowship almost dissolved,

01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:05.553
and we realized
that you might be

01:11:05.845 --> 01:11:07.930
the last person
that could help us.

01:11:08.222 --> 01:11:09.662
- We were hoping
that you still have

01:11:09.724 --> 01:11:11.444
the original game code
from back in the day.

01:11:11.726 --> 01:11:15.688
And honestly, Eugene
could really use his partner.

01:11:16.773 --> 01:11:18.232
- Well...

01:11:18.524 --> 01:11:19.734
first off...

01:11:20.026 --> 01:11:21.402
let me just say...

01:11:22.361 --> 01:11:23.571
points for creativity.

01:11:23.863 --> 01:11:25.591
I gotta tell ya, that whole
Nether Kraken thing,

01:11:25.615 --> 01:11:27.176
that is the most
original pile of horse shit

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:27.909
I have ever heard.

01:11:28.201 --> 01:11:30.203
And second, you
guys have been playing

01:11:30.495 --> 01:11:32.497
or smoking way too much.

01:11:32.789 --> 01:11:33.789
Now...

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:35.500
If it'll get you
guys outta here,

01:11:35.792 --> 01:11:36.959
I will tell you two fanboys

01:11:37.251 --> 01:11:39.420
exactly what went
down back in the day.

01:11:39.712 --> 01:11:41.255
Okay, here's the deal.

01:11:41.547 --> 01:11:42.787
Eugene freaked after I finished

01:11:42.882 --> 01:11:44.634
coding the game
after he passed out.

01:11:44.926 --> 01:11:46.206
He was royally pissed that I put

01:11:46.344 --> 01:11:48.064
the production order
through, and we fought,

01:11:48.304 --> 01:11:49.784
and we fought
harder than I ever had.

01:11:50.014 --> 01:11:51.390
He was always so damn protective

01:11:51.682 --> 01:11:53.643
of having the final
say of the code.

01:11:53.935 --> 01:11:55.454
I'd been cleaning
up his code for years

01:11:55.478 --> 01:11:57.355
while he was partying,
playing poster boy,

01:11:57.647 --> 01:11:59.398
wearing that stupid
Michael Jackson jacket

01:11:59.690 --> 01:12:00.770
and he couldn't even dance.

01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:03.223
We were on the verge of
bankruptcy with all his spending.

01:12:03.486 --> 01:12:04.821
I mean, who buys a DelLorean?

01:12:05.112 --> 01:12:07.114
And, true, I had tossed
him from the building.

01:12:07.406 --> 01:12:09.700
He was unstable, he
snapped, he had a mental break.

01:12:09.992 --> 01:12:12.036
He ranted about
spells and magic.

01:12:12.328 --> 01:12:14.080
Reality and fantasy
were a blur to him.

01:12:14.372 --> 01:12:15.581
He was his own biggest fanboy.

01:12:15.873 --> 01:12:18.626
So I had to do what
was best for the company.

01:12:18.918 --> 01:12:21.254
He didn't just torch a building
and our game that night.

01:12:21.546 --> 01:12:24.423
That selfish prick torched
our future and our friendship.

01:12:24.715 --> 01:12:28.177
He left me holding the
bag, as usual, again.

01:12:29.387 --> 01:12:30.763
- You kept it.

01:12:31.055 --> 01:12:32.348
- Course I did.

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:34.308
But I don't need it
anymore, you guys do.

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:36.537
And he's your problem
now, so good luck with that.

01:12:36.561 --> 01:12:38.437
- Wait, you're just
giving this to us?

01:12:38.729 --> 01:12:39.729
- Mm-hm.

01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:44.068
You're not even
curious to see him?

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.237
- Sends in a couple
of stupid kids,

01:12:46.529 --> 01:12:47.947
Tweedledee and Tweedledum,

01:12:48.239 --> 01:12:50.783
in her to tell me
a stupid story.

01:12:56.956 --> 01:12:58.875
- That can't be healthy.

01:13:00.126 --> 01:13:03.421
- Just, some things just
never change, you know?

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:04.714
- He's still going.

01:13:05.006 --> 01:13:06.299
- That's a health code violation

01:13:06.591 --> 01:13:09.135
and also just a
health violation.

01:13:14.181 --> 01:13:15.433
- You know what?

01:13:16.392 --> 01:13:17.727
Bar's closed.

01:13:18.019 --> 01:13:20.038
I'm washing my hands of
this whole thing, all right guys?

01:13:20.062 --> 01:13:21.123
I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.

01:13:21.147 --> 01:13:21.689
- Wait.
- Nah, nah, nah.

01:13:21.981 --> 01:13:22.690
We're done with this, all right?

01:13:22.982 --> 01:13:23.982
Take this.

01:13:24.066 --> 01:13:25.066
I don't want to see him.

01:13:25.318 --> 01:13:26.378
If I want to see an '80s cliche,

01:13:26.402 --> 01:13:27.842
I'll watch an A-ha
video, all right?

01:13:27.987 --> 01:13:28.987
Guys, get up.

01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:29.572
Let's get outta here.

01:13:29.864 --> 01:13:30.864
Come on.

01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:33.534
So unless it's raining
fie and brimstone outside,

01:13:33.826 --> 01:13:35.995
I'm not playing his stupid game.

01:13:38.372 --> 01:13:39.372
Shit.

01:13:42.084 --> 01:13:43.419
I'll get my coat.

01:13:47.298 --> 01:13:49.178
Max, first you bring
the Nether here.

01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:50.898
Now you're bringing
the lion into my den.

01:13:51.052 --> 01:13:52.720
I mean, literally into my den.

01:13:53.012 --> 01:13:54.114
You know why I
call him the lion?

01:13:54.138 --> 01:13:55.890
"Cause he's a
lyin' sack of shit!"

01:13:56.182 --> 01:13:57.558
I have nothing to
say to that man.

01:13:57.850 --> 01:13:59.268
- No arguing, no arguing.

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:00.102
No, no, no.

01:14:00.394 --> 01:14:03.731
No, no, no, don't
go, don't go, don't go.

01:14:04.023 --> 01:14:05.023
Bart?

01:14:06.275 --> 01:14:07.275
Oh!

01:14:07.443 --> 01:14:08.069
Genie!

01:14:08.361 --> 01:14:09.361
Look who's here!

01:14:11.697 --> 01:14:12.698
You look...

01:14:14.116 --> 01:14:15.116
old.

01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:18.704
And you have a little
something right there.

01:14:18.996 --> 01:14:20.122
Let me get that.

01:14:20.414 --> 01:14:21.791
You have something in your nose.

01:14:22.083 --> 01:14:23.083
Blow.

01:14:23.751 --> 01:14:24.751
Good boy.

01:14:25.962 --> 01:14:26.963
Good.

01:14:27.254 --> 01:14:28.254
Now...

01:14:28.422 --> 01:14:29.799
gimme a hug.

01:14:30.091 --> 01:14:31.091
- Here you go.

01:14:31.342 --> 01:14:31.884
There you go.

01:14:32.176 --> 01:14:32.760
- No, no, no.

01:14:33.052 --> 01:14:34.052
Ma, Ma, Ma, Ma.

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:35.471
Ma, come on, come on.

01:14:35.763 --> 01:14:36.763
Ma!

01:14:40.685 --> 01:14:41.685
Barton.

01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:43.770
- Eugene.

01:14:46.524 --> 01:14:48.442
- I'll go make some meatballs.

01:14:48.734 --> 01:14:49.734
- Sweet.

01:14:52.029 --> 01:14:54.615
- You got a helluva vagina
walking into my house like this!

01:14:54.907 --> 01:14:55.616
- I have a vagina?

01:14:55.908 --> 01:14:56.450
I have a vagina?

01:14:56.742 --> 01:14:57.284
Really?

01:14:57.576 --> 01:14:58.744
That's the apology from you?

01:14:59.036 --> 01:14:59.578
Okay.

01:14:59.870 --> 01:15:00.413
You know what?

01:15:00.705 --> 01:15:01.414
I don't have time
for this, all right?

01:15:01.706 --> 01:15:02.248
Okay?

01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:03.082
I tried.

01:15:03.374 --> 01:15:03.916
- Here we go.

01:15:04.208 --> 01:15:04.917
Walk out, you tried.

01:15:05.209 --> 01:15:06.649
Just like you tried
to ruin my life?

01:15:06.877 --> 01:15:08.717
Like you tried to ruin my
game back in the day?

01:15:08.754 --> 01:15:09.754
- Your game?

01:15:09.797 --> 01:15:10.423
Your game?

01:15:10.715 --> 01:15:11.715
Really?

01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:13.092
You know what?

01:15:13.384 --> 01:15:15.302
We staked our entire
lives on that game.

01:15:15.594 --> 01:15:16.594
That's what we did.

01:15:16.762 --> 01:15:17.304
But you know what?

01:15:17.596 --> 01:15:19.282
You were ranting like a
madman, parties like a rock star,

01:15:19.306 --> 01:15:21.183
being like, "Oh, oh,
this game is possessed."

01:15:21.475 --> 01:15:22.475
"Barton is possessed."

01:15:22.727 --> 01:15:23.269
- You were possessed!

01:15:23.561 --> 01:15:24.812
- We were both possessed!

01:15:25.104 --> 01:15:26.331
You wouldn't know that, though,

01:15:26.355 --> 01:15:28.691
because you were so cracked
out on cocaine and Yoo-hoos.

01:15:28.983 --> 01:15:29.692
- Ho Hos, they were Ho Hos.

01:15:29.984 --> 01:15:30.526
- Do not correct me.

01:15:30.818 --> 01:15:31.360
Do not...

01:15:31.652 --> 01:15:32.652
correct me!

01:15:34.613 --> 01:15:38.451
Even if you put aside
all of the bad juju

01:15:38.743 --> 01:15:39.744
you were dealing with...

01:15:40.036 --> 01:15:41.356
- Did he just call
him a bad Jew?

01:15:41.495 --> 01:15:42.830
- Shut up, Reggie!

01:15:44.999 --> 01:15:47.585
All I ever wanted was a partner.

01:15:48.711 --> 01:15:51.505
I just wanted a real partner.

01:15:51.797 --> 01:15:52.506
You know?

01:15:52.798 --> 01:15:54.091
Through thick and thin.

01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:55.383
And you...

01:15:56.552 --> 01:15:58.095
You turned out
to be a liability.

01:15:58.387 --> 01:16:00.973
- A liability?
- A liability!

01:16:01.265 --> 01:16:01.807
- Guys!

01:16:02.099 --> 01:16:03.350
Shut up!

01:16:03.642 --> 01:16:05.402
Look, you both had your
weaknesses exploited.

01:16:05.644 --> 01:16:06.644
Think about it.

01:16:06.812 --> 01:16:08.647
You both got
gamed by the nether.

01:16:08.939 --> 01:16:09.939
- What are you saying?

01:16:09.982 --> 01:16:11.376
- I'm saying it's
not anyone's fault.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:12.568
- Oh, of course!

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:14.212
It's always
somebody else's fault,

01:16:14.236 --> 01:16:15.236
right mister Millennial?

01:16:15.404 --> 01:16:15.946
- Shut up, Gene!

01:16:16.238 --> 01:16:16.781
Just listen to the kid!

01:16:17.073 --> 01:16:18.824
- Look, it wants to play me.

01:16:19.116 --> 01:16:20.826
But we've been going
about it all wrong.

01:16:21.118 --> 01:16:22.453
We can't shut it down remotely,

01:16:22.745 --> 01:16:24.288
we can't delete
it, we can't quit.

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:25.748
- Yeah, me, me, me, me.

01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:27.040
It wants to play you.

01:16:27.291 --> 01:16:29.585
We get it, you're
the chosen one!

01:16:29.877 --> 01:16:30.419
- Look...

01:16:30.711 --> 01:16:33.214
We have to play it, as a team!

01:16:33.506 --> 01:16:35.007
But we have to change the game.

01:16:35.299 --> 01:16:38.427
We have to go to that school
and change the source code.

01:16:38.719 --> 01:16:41.430
- Wait, I'm not following you.

01:16:41.722 --> 01:16:43.722
- What's the one thing the
Nether Dungeon never had

01:16:43.766 --> 01:16:45.267
and it won't be expecting?

01:16:45.559 --> 01:16:46.559
- Multiplayer.

01:16:48.562 --> 01:16:49.706
- Even with the original code,

01:16:49.730 --> 01:16:50.730
to build in that feature,

01:16:50.898 --> 01:16:52.459
we'd have to like port it
directly into the server.

01:16:52.483 --> 01:16:53.859
- Yeah, you know...

01:16:54.151 --> 01:16:57.530
even I couldn't
code that shit in time.

01:16:57.822 --> 01:16:59.532
- Not unless we do it together.

01:16:59.824 --> 01:17:03.035
- Okay, well, if we're going
in there against the Nether,

01:17:03.327 --> 01:17:05.204
we're gonna need fire power.

01:17:05.496 --> 01:17:06.872
- Leave that to me.

01:17:07.832 --> 01:17:09.667
- This is like a movie!

01:19:01.779 --> 01:19:03.030
Where is everyone?

01:19:03.322 --> 01:19:03.906
- I don't like it.

01:19:04.198 --> 01:19:05.278
It's like a third-party map

01:19:05.449 --> 01:19:05.991
on Nether Quest.
- Nether Quest.

01:19:06.283 --> 01:19:07.283
Dungeon Master's Castle.

01:19:07.368 --> 01:19:08.953
- That's what I just said.

01:19:09.245 --> 01:19:10.472
- No you didn't,
I just said that.

01:19:10.496 --> 01:19:11.496
- I just said that.

01:19:11.538 --> 01:19:12.081
- No you didn't, you just...

01:19:12.373 --> 01:19:12.915
- I just said those words.

01:19:13.207 --> 01:19:13.916
- No, you said Dungeon Master...

01:19:14.208 --> 01:19:14.750
- Yes, I did.

01:19:15.042 --> 01:19:15.584
Yes, I...
- That's what I said.

01:19:15.876 --> 01:19:16.937
- Yes, I did.
- I said that, right?

01:19:16.961 --> 01:19:17.503
You said...
- Yeah.

01:19:17.795 --> 01:19:18.837
- Hey, guys...

01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:22.591
Reggie, Liz...

01:19:24.051 --> 01:19:25.051
you ready?

01:19:25.219 --> 01:19:26.259
I'll run briefs, you tail.

01:19:26.345 --> 01:19:27.054
- I've got your flank.

01:19:27.346 --> 01:19:29.598
- Upload the mods and
stay on your comms.

01:19:29.890 --> 01:19:31.767
- We'll locate the server room.

01:19:32.059 --> 01:19:33.894
- We'll locate the server room.

01:19:34.186 --> 01:19:34.812
- I...

01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:36.188
I just...

01:19:36.480 --> 01:19:37.690
I just said that.

01:19:44.863 --> 01:19:46.532
You guys ready?

01:19:50.077 --> 01:19:51.161
- Knock knock?

01:19:57.126 --> 01:19:58.585
- You guys sure you got this?

01:19:58.877 --> 01:19:59.962
- Do us proud.

01:20:00.254 --> 01:20:02.589
- Can't carry it
for you Mr. Frodo.

01:20:02.881 --> 01:20:05.009
But I can carry you.

01:20:05.301 --> 01:20:06.010
- Come on.

01:20:06.302 --> 01:20:07.302
- Let's rock!

01:20:08.304 --> 01:20:09.388
- Okay.

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:10.680
Excuse me.

01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:14.977
- Now!

01:20:15.269 --> 01:20:16.269
- Come on!

01:20:19.982 --> 01:20:20.566
- Hey!

01:20:20.858 --> 01:20:21.525
Come on, kid.

01:20:21.817 --> 01:20:22.817
They got this.

01:20:23.736 --> 01:20:24.736
They got this, right?

01:20:24.862 --> 01:20:25.529
- Yeah, they got this.

01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:26.981
You gotta trust your partner.

01:20:27.072 --> 01:20:27.614
- Yeah.

01:20:27.906 --> 01:20:28.449
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:20:28.741 --> 01:20:30.200
Come on, trust your partners.

01:20:30.492 --> 01:20:31.492
Let's go.

01:20:37.082 --> 01:20:38.082
Come on.

01:20:38.167 --> 01:20:39.543
Trust your partner.

01:20:39.835 --> 01:20:40.377
- Sorry.

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:41.669
Sorry, sorry.

01:20:59.396 --> 01:21:00.856
- I hope this thing works.

01:21:12.242 --> 01:21:13.242
Bitchin'.

01:21:45.734 --> 01:21:46.735
Guys...

01:21:47.027 --> 01:21:48.278
I'm in the arena.

01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:50.447
Oh, this place is a trip!

01:21:59.581 --> 01:22:00.749
Uh...

01:22:01.041 --> 01:22:01.667
guys?

01:22:01.959 --> 01:22:02.584
Shit's gettin' real in here.

01:22:02.876 --> 01:22:04.503
You might wanna hurry.

01:22:13.762 --> 01:22:14.762
- Okay.

01:22:18.767 --> 01:22:19.393
Are you kiddin' me?

01:22:19.685 --> 01:22:20.685
Come on.

01:22:22.146 --> 01:22:23.146
Uh...

01:22:24.523 --> 01:22:25.523
Bingo.

01:22:32.865 --> 01:22:34.366
- How much time do you need?

01:22:34.658 --> 01:22:36.201
- Like three minutes.

01:22:37.828 --> 01:22:38.828
- All right, you're...

01:22:39.037 --> 01:22:40.432
You're the best
coder I know, okay?

01:22:40.456 --> 01:22:40.998
- Yeah.

01:22:41.290 --> 01:22:41.832
- You got this.

01:22:42.124 --> 01:22:43.333
- I got this.

01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:44.625
- Yeah, I just said that.

01:22:44.835 --> 01:22:45.502
- Okay, okay,
okay, go, go, go, go.

01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:47.671
- Okay, okay, okay.

01:22:47.963 --> 01:22:48.963
Hey!

01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:52.426
I'm burnin' down your
castle, you Nether turds!

01:22:52.718 --> 01:22:53.718
Huh?

01:22:53.927 --> 01:22:54.928
You wanna fight?

01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:56.388
Come on!

01:22:56.680 --> 01:22:58.140
Come and get me!

01:22:58.432 --> 01:23:00.559
Daddy's home!

01:23:02.728 --> 01:23:03.270
- Don't just stand there!

01:23:03.562 --> 01:23:04.562
Stop him!

01:23:13.947 --> 01:23:14.947
- Piece of cake.

01:23:16.617 --> 01:23:18.619
- Did you see that
punch move I just did?

01:23:18.911 --> 01:23:20.204
- You see me pwn that noob?

01:23:20.496 --> 01:23:21.121
- Oh my god.

01:23:21.413 --> 01:23:23.207
Dude, we just killed it!

01:23:45.437 --> 01:23:46.897
- Just...

01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:48.690
let me adjust my chair here.

01:23:48.982 --> 01:23:52.528
I can't kick your ass
if I'm not comfortable.

01:23:54.238 --> 01:23:56.198
Oh, 30 seconds left.

01:23:56.490 --> 01:23:59.618
I always like running
down the clock.

01:23:59.910 --> 01:24:01.245
Come on, guys.

01:24:10.837 --> 01:24:11.837
- Hey noob...

01:24:12.047 --> 01:24:13.047
Blue lightning bolt!

01:24:20.472 --> 01:24:21.557
- Oh, shit.

01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:38.532
- Boom!

01:24:38.824 --> 01:24:39.908
High score.

01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:40.742
- Thank you.

01:24:41.034 --> 01:24:42.034
- Yeah, let's go.

01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:43.160
- Okay.

01:24:45.581 --> 01:24:46.248
I'm good!

01:24:46.540 --> 01:24:47.540
I'm good.

01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:50.419
- All right, Doom Bringer dude.

01:24:50.711 --> 01:24:54.840
Hope you don't mind if I
invite a few of my friends.

01:25:10.272 --> 01:25:11.565
Okay, guys...

01:25:11.857 --> 01:25:12.857
we got it.

01:25:30.542 --> 01:25:31.960
Whoa.

01:25:32.252 --> 01:25:33.252
Damn, Liz!

01:25:36.632 --> 01:25:37.674
What are you laughing at?

01:25:37.966 --> 01:25:39.176
Look at your gear, dude.

01:25:39.468 --> 01:25:40.844
- Don't be jealous.

01:25:51.813 --> 01:25:53.899
- Shit just got real real.

01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:57.736
- Oh shit, he's really big.

01:25:58.028 --> 01:25:59.028
- Yeah.

01:26:12.626 --> 01:26:14.252
We're in its world now,

01:26:14.544 --> 01:26:16.144
which means we
gotta play bit its rules.

01:26:16.338 --> 01:26:18.298
- Yeah, it also means
that we have no extra lives.

01:26:18.465 --> 01:26:20.801
- Rogue-like, perma-death.

01:26:21.093 --> 01:26:22.260
- Okay.

01:26:22.552 --> 01:26:24.680
Here's what we're gonna do.

01:26:24.971 --> 01:26:27.349
Liz, open it up with
the lightwave aura spell.

01:26:27.641 --> 01:26:28.641
Reg...

01:26:28.809 --> 01:26:30.310
brimstone blockade?

01:26:30.602 --> 01:26:32.646
- You've got my shield.

01:26:32.938 --> 01:26:34.231
- You've got my staff.

01:26:34.523 --> 01:26:35.941
- We've got each other.

01:26:37.067 --> 01:26:40.195
- Hey, don't mess
it up like usual.

01:26:40.487 --> 01:26:41.487
- Let's rock!

01:27:13.770 --> 01:27:15.021
- Bob and weave, Max.

01:27:15.313 --> 01:27:16.313
Bob and weave!

01:28:03.069 --> 01:28:04.069
- Max!

01:28:50.242 --> 01:28:50.951
- Yes!

01:28:51.243 --> 01:28:52.243
Woo!

01:28:52.828 --> 01:28:55.121
We just saved the world!

01:28:55.413 --> 01:28:56.413
- Oh my god.

01:29:15.183 --> 01:29:16.268
So, that's it?

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:17.102
Yup.

01:29:17.394 --> 01:29:17.936
It's over?

01:29:18.228 --> 01:29:19.372
How are we gonna explain this?

01:29:19.396 --> 01:29:20.706
Well, that's the beauty, kid.

01:29:20.730 --> 01:29:25.360
When these folks come out of
this, they won't remember shit.

01:29:25.652 --> 01:29:26.361
- And you should've seen Max.

01:29:26.653 --> 01:29:28.363
He totally sacrificed himself.

01:29:28.655 --> 01:29:29.781
- That was so hot!

01:29:30.073 --> 01:29:31.908
- What about Liz
rocking that mage staff?

01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:33.535
And Reggie, dude, that ax work?

01:29:33.827 --> 01:29:35.120
And, hey, you didn't bail.

01:29:35.412 --> 01:29:37.163
Guys, what about
those sweet outfits?

01:29:37.455 --> 01:29:37.998
- Oh, the kilt?

01:29:38.290 --> 01:29:39.290
That was so freeing.

01:29:39.457 --> 01:29:40.876
- These guys are the shiznits.

01:29:41.167 --> 01:29:41.710
- Yeah.

01:29:42.002 --> 01:29:44.170
- Real Nether blasters.

01:29:46.298 --> 01:29:47.298
- That's it!

01:29:48.758 --> 01:29:50.118
- Oh, it is official,
my children!

01:29:50.343 --> 01:29:52.304
Man, the Nether Blasters...

01:29:52.596 --> 01:29:56.474
are now members of the
International E-Sports League!

01:29:58.143 --> 01:30:00.228
You get a jersey,
you get a jersey!

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:01.062
- Sweet!

01:30:01.354 --> 01:30:01.980
- And are we gonna
leave you jersey-less?

01:30:02.272 --> 01:30:03.440
Welcome to new jersey!

01:30:03.732 --> 01:30:04.858
Oh my god, look at that!

01:30:05.150 --> 01:30:05.692
Put 'em on!

01:30:05.984 --> 01:30:06.526
We should all live in jerseys.

01:30:06.818 --> 01:30:07.818
- They look awesome!

01:30:07.903 --> 01:30:08.945
- That looks jer...

01:30:09.237 --> 01:30:10.906
That's jersey fresh.

01:30:11.197 --> 01:30:12.574
Well done, kids,
well done, kids.

01:30:12.866 --> 01:30:13.450
- Boom town!

01:30:13.742 --> 01:30:15.619
- This is really, really cool.

01:30:15.911 --> 01:30:16.911
Oh my god, it's startin'.

01:30:16.953 --> 01:30:18.014
Come here, come here,
come here, come here!

01:30:18.038 --> 01:30:19.038
It's on, it's happenin'!

01:30:19.205 --> 01:30:20.749
Come back here, look at this!

01:30:21.041 --> 01:30:22.041
Everyone shut up!

01:30:22.292 --> 01:30:24.169
I know you weren't
talkin', but, you know.

01:30:24.461 --> 01:30:25.170
One question for you!

01:30:25.462 --> 01:30:27.213
We have one question,
one question for you!

01:30:27.505 --> 01:30:28.524
- You know what,
before we start,

01:30:28.548 --> 01:30:29.734
can I just say
we're really excited

01:30:29.758 --> 01:30:31.009
to be working with Konicom.

01:30:31.301 --> 01:30:34.721
The game is called
the Nether Realm VR.

01:30:35.013 --> 01:30:35.555
Okay?

01:30:35.847 --> 01:30:36.389
Write that down.

01:30:36.681 --> 01:30:38.201
Nether Realm VR,
and it's a way for us

01:30:38.266 --> 01:30:40.852
to take the Nether
series to the next level.

01:30:41.144 --> 01:30:41.686
- Yes.

01:30:41.978 --> 01:30:42.646
Yeah, that's
right, that's right.

01:30:42.938 --> 01:30:43.480
No, hold on one second.

01:30:43.772 --> 01:30:45.607
See, it's old but it's
new again, you know?

01:30:45.899 --> 01:30:48.443
We're working with a
brilliant new team of talent.

01:30:48.735 --> 01:30:50.737
Our lead development
intern is this guy

01:30:51.029 --> 01:30:52.447
named Max Jenkins,
who's a genius.

01:30:52.739 --> 01:30:54.532
- That's me, that's me!

01:30:54.824 --> 01:30:55.367
- You're famous!

01:30:55.659 --> 01:30:56.659
We know someone famous!

01:30:57.786 --> 01:31:01.247
- And his Beta Blasters,
who are Reggie and Liz.

01:31:01.539 --> 01:31:02.539
- Oh my god!

01:31:02.582 --> 01:31:03.208
You guys are like

01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:04.876
I The professor and Mary Ann ♪

01:31:05.168 --> 01:31:06.836
You got mentions as well!

01:31:07.128 --> 01:31:08.814
- They are fantastic,
and they're working out

01:31:08.838 --> 01:31:10.757
all the bugs in the
game before it's released.

01:31:11.049 --> 01:31:11.591
- We have a great team.

01:31:11.883 --> 01:31:12.963
Rest assured, a great team.

01:31:13.093 --> 01:31:14.445
- A great team.
- Yes, you in the back.

01:31:14.469 --> 01:31:15.011
- Oh my god!

01:31:15.303 --> 01:31:17.514
Okay, huge fan,
total Nether groupie.

01:31:17.806 --> 01:31:19.516
You guys, this is incredible!

01:31:19.808 --> 01:31:23.520
I mean, you're both back
together, working together again!

01:31:23.812 --> 01:31:25.772
You still living with your mom?

01:31:28.692 --> 01:31:30.336
We have one question,
one questions for you.

01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:31.403
- I'm sorry, for Konicom.

01:31:31.695 --> 01:31:33.415
- So, with Eugene and
Bart back on the team,

01:31:33.613 --> 01:31:35.448
will Nether Realm VR resemble

01:31:35.740 --> 01:31:37.742
any of the early installments
of the Nether series,

01:31:38.034 --> 01:31:42.372
and will there be any Easter
eggs for fans in the game?

01:31:42.664 --> 01:31:43.664
- Yeah.

01:31:47.252 --> 01:31:48.252
- Yes.

01:31:56.177 --> 01:31:57.887
- Who speaks Russian?

01:31:58.179 --> 01:31:59.179
-Uh ..

01:32:02.976 --> 01:32:04.412
- Why don't they
ever translate this?

01:32:04.436 --> 01:32:04.978
Oh, here it is.

01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:06.350
- We're excited to announce

01:32:06.438 --> 01:32:08.481
as a surprise to
our friends here...

01:32:08.773 --> 01:32:10.292
- Give me your hand,
give me your hand.

01:32:10.316 --> 01:32:12.902
- That we've been
able to recover old code

01:32:13.194 --> 01:32:16.364
from the Nether Dungeon
and will be including

01:32:16.656 --> 01:32:19.534
a retro tribute
mode in their honor.

01:32:19.826 --> 01:32:22.871
Question for Konicom,
one question for Konicom!

01:32:23.163 --> 01:32:25.040
- Oh my god, yes!

01:32:25.331 --> 01:32:26.331
Yes!

01:32:26.583 --> 01:32:29.252
This game is gonna
change history, man!

01:32:29.544 --> 01:32:30.837
History!

01:33:03.995 --> 01:33:04.995
- Poor Steve.

01:33:05.121 --> 01:33:06.121
Yeah, well...

01:33:07.999 --> 01:33:09.334
Steve!

01:33:09.626 --> 01:33:11.544
- Whoa, guys, you
are not gonna believe

01:33:11.836 --> 01:33:13.421
the dream I just had.

01:33:13.713 --> 01:33:14.982
I have really gotta
change the vitamins,

01:33:15.006 --> 01:33:18.009
up the carbs, and
double the supplements.

01:34:46.431 --> 01:34:47.431
- Whoa!

01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:50.310
Gramps?

01:34:50.602 --> 01:34:52.482
We gotta get that
sleepwalking figured out, man.

01:34:52.645 --> 01:34:53.354
For real.

01:34:53.646 --> 01:34:57.609
- At least I didn't take
my clothes off this time.

01:34:58.568 --> 01:35:00.403
- It's good to see you.

01:35:03.239 --> 01:35:04.239
- What was that about?

01:35:04.490 --> 01:35:05.658
- Nothing.

01:35:05.950 --> 01:35:08.369
Oh, by the way, I got a new
internship at a gaming company.

01:35:08.661 --> 01:35:09.829
- Really?

01:35:10.121 --> 01:35:10.663
That's great.

01:35:10.955 --> 01:35:11.955
That's just great.

01:35:12.123 --> 01:35:13.123
Let's celebrate!

01:35:13.333 --> 01:35:14.334
I'll make some steak.

01:35:14.626 --> 01:35:15.293
Come on.

01:35:15.585 --> 01:35:16.628
- I'm starving.

01:36:08.513 --> 01:36:09.513
You...

01:36:09.597 --> 01:36:10.139
First things first, bud.

01:36:10.431 --> 01:36:12.141
You walk into our store.

01:36:12.433 --> 01:36:12.976
Am I too...

01:36:13.268 --> 01:36:14.578
Oh, did I miss my mark?

01:36:14.602 --> 01:36:15.144
Sorry.

01:36:15.436 --> 01:36:15.979
- That's all right.

01:36:16.271 --> 01:36:16.813
I'll find the camera.

01:36:17.105 --> 01:36:19.691
I'll find the camera.

01:36:19.983 --> 01:36:21.150
- Here you go gamers.

01:36:22.402 --> 01:36:23.402
Whoa!

01:36:24.362 --> 01:36:25.029
Wow.

01:36:25.321 --> 01:36:26.321
Cut!

01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:28.133
You got that, right?

01:36:28.157 --> 01:36:29.742
- You're a single player, kid.

01:36:30.034 --> 01:36:32.036
Always have been,
always will be.

01:36:32.328 --> 01:36:35.707
- At least I won't be remembered
as a washed-up has-bee.

01:36:36.833 --> 01:36:37.375
That's a...

01:36:37.667 --> 01:36:38.209
That's...

01:36:38.501 --> 01:36:39.502
That's a real effect.

01:36:39.794 --> 01:36:40.938
That's a legit effect.

01:36:40.962 --> 01:36:42.314
Wow, that was so
incredible, that timing.

01:36:42.338 --> 01:36:43.338
Jesus!

01:36:43.464 --> 01:36:44.464
- Wow!

01:36:45.466 --> 01:36:48.219
This virtual mall
is amazing, man.

01:36:49.679 --> 01:36:50.679
And I...

01:36:51.514 --> 01:36:53.433
I am a virtual mall rat.

01:36:54.559 --> 01:36:55.559
Yes!

01:36:56.978 --> 01:36:57.520
Thank you, sir.

01:36:57.812 --> 01:36:58.812
Come on!

01:36:58.980 --> 01:37:00.020
Thank you for humoring me.

01:37:02.317 --> 01:37:03.836
- How was I supposed to
know that was gonna happen?

01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:05.236
- Just listen!

01:37:05.528 --> 01:37:08.281
That's all you had
to do, was listen!

01:37:08.573 --> 01:37:10.742
I don't remember what you
were supposed to listen to.

01:37:11.034 --> 01:37:12.076
What is it?

01:37:12.368 --> 01:37:13.679
All you had to do
was listen to me!

01:37:13.703 --> 01:37:14.847
I've been, I've been,
I've been preparing

01:37:14.871 --> 01:37:17.332
my whole life for this moment.

01:37:17.623 --> 01:37:19.250
Oh, you mean the ancient...

01:37:20.376 --> 01:37:20.918
All right, from the top.

01:37:21.210 --> 01:37:23.004
- Two guys that are like...

01:37:23.296 --> 01:37:24.296
"Oh, yeah."

01:37:25.256 --> 01:37:27.008
I can't remember shit.

01:37:27.967 --> 01:37:28.968
Ma!

01:37:33.181 --> 01:37:38.102
You turned her into a god
damn dog, you son of a bitch!

01:37:38.436 --> 01:37:39.103
- What?

01:37:39.395 --> 01:37:40.772
- Bros, bros, bros, same team!

01:37:43.191 --> 01:37:43.733
- Come on!
- What?

01:37:44.025 --> 01:37:45.505
- Bros, bros, we're
on the same team!

01:37:45.651 --> 01:37:46.986
- Bring it!

01:37:50.490 --> 01:37:51.508
- I wasn't expecting that.

01:37:51.532 --> 01:37:52.158
It was so good.

01:37:52.450 --> 01:37:53.450
I'm sorry.

01:37:53.576 --> 01:37:54.576
- Ma!

01:37:59.791 --> 01:38:01.084
Cut!

01:38:03.461 --> 01:38:05.671
Holy shit!

01:38:06.756 --> 01:38:07.816
- I've just realized
I ate the gum

01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:09.440
with the wrapper
on it, but that's okay.

01:38:11.636 --> 01:38:12.905
Dude, commit, you're killin' it.

01:38:12.929 --> 01:38:14.009
- Let's do it, let's do it.

01:38:17.058 --> 01:38:18.309
- Ma, meatballs!

01:38:20.686 --> 01:38:21.686
Cut!

01:38:22.939 --> 01:38:24.315
Ma, margaritas!

01:38:24.607 --> 01:38:26.401
- Meatballs, Ma.

01:38:26.692 --> 01:38:30.154
You know, even I couldn't
code that shit in time.

01:38:30.446 --> 01:38:32.740
- Not unless we do it together.

01:38:33.032 --> 01:38:34.032
- Together.

01:38:34.283 --> 01:38:35.283

- Is that racist?

We get it!

01:39:02.353 --> 01:39:02.979
It wants to play you!

01:39:03.271 --> 01:39:04.355
You're the chosen one!

01:39:04.647 --> 01:39:05.647
We get it!

01:39:07.233 --> 01:39:08.985
Damn straight.

01:39:10.570 --> 01:39:11.237
Cut.

01:39:11.529 --> 01:39:12.529
And action.

01:39:13.823 --> 01:39:14.490
- Hey!

01:39:14.782 --> 01:39:15.782
Come on, kid.

01:39:15.908 --> 01:39:17.201
They got this.

01:39:17.493 --> 01:39:18.494
They got this, right?

01:39:18.786 --> 01:39:20.997
- Yeah, they got this.

01:39:21.289 --> 01:39:22.582
You gotta trust your partner.

01:39:22.874 --> 01:39:24.459
- Oh, you gotta
trust your partner?

01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:29.255
Cut.

01:39:31.048 --> 01:39:31.757
- And you should've seen Max.

01:39:32.049 --> 01:39:33.489
Like, he totally
sacrificed himself.

01:39:33.593 --> 01:39:34.593
- That was pretty hot.

01:39:34.677 --> 01:39:36.929
- Well, what about Liz
rockin' that mage staff?

01:39:37.221 --> 01:39:38.681
And Reggie, dude that ax work...

01:39:38.973 --> 01:39:39.973
Oh, shit!

01:39:40.641 --> 01:39:41.641
- Oh no!
- No!

01:39:42.810 --> 01:39:43.810
Cut.

01:39:43.978 --> 01:39:44.687
- So, that's it?

01:39:44.979 --> 01:39:45.521
Yup.

01:39:45.813 --> 01:39:46.355
- It's over?

01:39:46.647 --> 01:39:47.190
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:39:47.482 --> 01:39:48.834
- How are we gonna
explain this, though?

01:39:48.858 --> 01:39:50.085
- Well, that's the
beauty of this.

01:39:50.109 --> 01:39:52.045
When these people wake up,
they won't remember a thing.

01:39:52.069 --> 01:39:53.309
- Geno, you know, this whole...

01:39:53.404 --> 01:39:53.946
Holy fuck!

01:39:54.238 --> 01:39:54.780
What just happened?
- Oh, shit.

01:39:55.072 --> 01:39:56.592
- Oh my god, it
started all over again!

01:39:58.784 --> 01:40:00.495
- This is like a movie!

01:40:03.498 --> 01:40:04.916
Right?

01:40:05.208 --> 01:40:06.208
Don't you guys see it?

01:40:06.417 --> 01:40:07.853
You know, the friends
coming together,

01:40:07.877 --> 01:40:10.546
and best friend thing, and...

01:40:10.838 --> 01:40:12.118
you know, the undiscovered love,

01:40:12.298 --> 01:40:14.675
and he finds it
at the end, and...

01:40:14.967 --> 01:40:15.967
the Nether?

01:40:16.177 --> 01:40:17.177
The Nether!

01:40:18.012 --> 01:40:18.679
Right?

01:40:18.971 --> 01:40:20.515
The video game store.

01:40:21.641 --> 01:40:22.641
Fighting th...

01:40:22.683 --> 01:40:24.852
You have a glowing
sword, for god sakes.

01:40:25.144 --> 01:40:28.314
Who has a glowing
sword other than a movie?

01:40:28.606 --> 01:40:30.316
Small budget, not a lotta money.

01:40:30.608 --> 01:40:32.985
I don't know we did it.
