WEBVTT

00:01.728 --> 00:05.732
*

00:20.646 --> 00:24.617
It looks so... sad and lonely.

00:24.650 --> 00:27.020
The penchant
for biological life-forms

00:27.053 --> 00:30.556
to anthropomorphize
inanimate objects is irrational.

00:30.589 --> 00:34.560
I am quite certain the planet is
unaware of its solitary status.

00:34.593 --> 00:36.896
How many planets were
in this system originally?

00:36.930 --> 00:38.564
11 total.

00:38.597 --> 00:41.334
Man, ten planets gobbled up
by a hungry star.

00:41.367 --> 00:43.803
Remind me not to be on Earth
when that happens to us.

00:43.837 --> 00:45.705
Earth's sun will not become
a red supergiant

00:45.739 --> 00:48.241
for another five billion years,
Commander.

00:48.274 --> 00:50.676
You will be long deceased
and forgotten.

00:50.710 --> 00:53.212
(laughs) There's gonna be some
ladies still talking about me.

00:53.246 --> 00:55.715
Seems kind of sadistic
that all we're here to do

00:55.749 --> 00:57.817
is watch a helpless planet
get vaporized.

00:57.851 --> 01:01.687
A stellar incineration is one of
the rarest sights in the galaxy.

01:01.721 --> 01:05.091
We are fortunate
to observe one at close range.

01:05.124 --> 01:07.393
Well, we got three days until
that little guy gets fried,

01:07.426 --> 01:09.528
so you all have time
to say your goodbyes.

01:09.562 --> 01:10.696
(computer chirping)

01:10.730 --> 01:12.598
Captain, the planet's atmosphere

01:12.631 --> 01:13.900
is beginning to evaporate.

01:13.933 --> 01:15.735
Magnify.

01:22.776 --> 01:24.710
Would you look at that.

01:24.744 --> 01:26.913
KELLY: When the oceans
start going with it,

01:26.946 --> 01:28.748
we're going to get
even more of a show.

01:28.782 --> 01:31.684
Captain,
my shift ends in 15 minutes.

01:31.717 --> 01:33.119
Request permission
to leave early.

01:33.152 --> 01:35.521
Yeah, it's fine,
but you don't want to see this?

01:35.554 --> 01:39.458
It is very... interesting,
but I am not feeling well.

01:39.492 --> 01:41.094
All good.
We'll see you tomorrow.

01:46.465 --> 01:48.401
You know, that's the third time
this week he's done that.

01:48.434 --> 01:50.403
Maybe he's pregnant again.

01:50.436 --> 01:52.806
Ugh. God, no.

01:55.141 --> 01:56.575
(comm device trills)

01:56.609 --> 01:58.111
Yes?

01:58.144 --> 02:00.046
KLYDEN (over comm):
Bortus, it is Klyden.

02:00.079 --> 02:01.714
When will you be home?

02:01.747 --> 02:04.650
I am sorry, Klyden,
I must work late again.

02:04.683 --> 02:07.220
KLYDEN: You have worked late
every night this week.

02:07.253 --> 02:10.589
It is too much. Come home.
I have made pudding.

02:10.623 --> 02:13.592
My duties to the ship
must be performed.

02:13.626 --> 02:16.662
-We will have pudding later.
-(comm beeps)

02:29.375 --> 02:31.811
(sighs)

02:33.546 --> 02:36.715
Begin Simulation Bortus 486.

02:40.219 --> 02:42.755
Initiate scenario.

02:42.788 --> 02:44.790
(animal sounds in distance)

02:53.399 --> 02:56.802
I've been awaiting you, Bortus.

03:18.324 --> 03:20.326
*

03:50.356 --> 03:52.358
*

04:29.929 --> 04:31.931
*

04:43.742 --> 04:46.812
Bortus. What time is it?

04:46.845 --> 04:50.749
It is late.
Go back to sleep.

04:50.783 --> 04:52.618
It is very late.

04:52.651 --> 04:54.720
Why must the captain give you
so much work?

04:54.753 --> 04:56.255
It is not right.

04:56.289 --> 04:58.724
If the captain wishes me
to work such hours,

04:58.757 --> 05:00.259
I must comply.

05:00.293 --> 05:02.728
You are third in command
aboard this vessel.

05:02.761 --> 05:04.730
Surely, you can speak to him
about this.

05:04.763 --> 05:07.133
I do not wish to have
this argument right now.

05:07.166 --> 05:09.602
(sighs)
Neither do I.

05:10.636 --> 05:12.805
I wish to make love.

05:12.838 --> 05:16.609
I'm very tired from my work.
I wish to rest immediately.

05:16.642 --> 05:19.112
Topa has gone to sleep.
He will not awaken.

05:19.145 --> 05:21.347
I am not in the mood, Klyden.

05:21.380 --> 05:22.915
You are never in the mood!

05:22.948 --> 05:25.518
Your job is ruining
the sexual event.

05:25.551 --> 05:27.653
We will share the sexual event
another night.

05:27.686 --> 05:31.657
Now, lower your voice
or you will wake Topa.

05:31.690 --> 05:33.792
(frustrated groan)

05:34.827 --> 05:37.663
(sighs)

05:53.512 --> 05:55.814
Papa, can I be all done now?

05:55.848 --> 05:58.784
No, Topa.
Finish your plokta.

05:58.817 --> 06:01.454
Remember, if you do not eat,
you will die.

06:01.487 --> 06:03.656
Bortus, we must talk.

06:03.689 --> 06:06.659
Will it take long? I am due
on the bridge very soon.

06:06.692 --> 06:09.328
What I have to say
is very simple.

06:09.362 --> 06:11.464
I would like you
to make more time for me.

06:11.497 --> 06:13.799
I am your mate,
and I do not wish to compete

06:13.832 --> 06:15.534
with your work duties.

06:15.568 --> 06:17.303
I will look into it.

06:17.336 --> 06:18.571
Let us discuss this later.

06:18.604 --> 06:21.240
No! We will discuss it
right now.

06:21.274 --> 06:23.076
Please lower the volume
of your voice.

06:23.109 --> 06:24.910
Stop telling me
to lower my voice!

06:24.943 --> 06:26.712
I grow weary of your evasion.

06:26.745 --> 06:30.349
Your absence in our lives
must be addressed.

06:30.383 --> 06:34.553
I am told the union of Captain
Mercer and Commander Grayson

06:34.587 --> 06:36.822
was dissolved
over similar failings.

06:36.855 --> 06:39.225
He worked far too many hours,
as you do.

06:39.258 --> 06:41.194
We must learn from their errors.

06:41.227 --> 06:42.761
I will do my best.

06:42.795 --> 06:45.764
Now, I must report for duty.

06:48.767 --> 06:51.570
I wish to share
the evening meal tonight.

06:51.604 --> 06:53.072
And to talk.

06:53.106 --> 06:55.341
Very well. We will eat.

06:55.374 --> 06:57.576
I will see you this evening.

06:59.745 --> 07:01.714
(door whooshes shut)

07:04.417 --> 07:06.419
*

07:12.158 --> 07:13.926
KELLY:
An entire ocean,

07:13.959 --> 07:16.729
boiled away like a pot of water
on a stove.

07:16.762 --> 07:19.532
Captain,
internal scans of the planet

07:19.565 --> 07:21.900
show that there may be deposits
of dysonium ore

07:21.934 --> 07:23.136
beneath the surface.

07:23.169 --> 07:24.537
May be or are?

07:24.570 --> 07:26.071
The scans are slow to process,

07:26.105 --> 07:28.307
due to the planet's proximity
to the photosphere.

07:28.341 --> 07:32.911
However, I would estimate
the probability is 87%.

07:32.945 --> 07:34.880
-Free gas.
-KELLY: John, is there

07:34.913 --> 07:37.650
any way we could collect it
after the planet breaks up?

07:37.683 --> 07:39.918
We might be able to use
a wide-range tractor beam.

07:39.952 --> 07:41.620
We could modify it to weed out

07:41.654 --> 07:43.489
all the fragments
containing dysonium.

07:43.522 --> 07:45.591
Haul them in,
fill up the shuttle bay.

07:45.624 --> 07:48.093
That much dysonium could
power this ship for a year.

07:48.127 --> 07:49.662
All right, start modifying
the tractor beam.

07:49.695 --> 07:51.730
Isaac, go to engineering
and assist him.

07:51.764 --> 07:53.632
-Aye, sir.
-BORTUS: Captain.

07:53.666 --> 07:56.001
Request permission
to be relieved early.

07:56.034 --> 07:57.670
Are you not feeling well again?

07:57.703 --> 07:59.572
No, I am fine.

07:59.605 --> 08:01.774
I promised Klyden we would
spend the evening together.

08:01.807 --> 08:04.443
You know, Bortus, you've left
early four times this week.

08:04.477 --> 08:06.345
I know.
It will not happen again.

08:06.379 --> 08:08.681
And I will put in an extra shift
this weekend.

08:08.714 --> 08:11.049
All right.
Tell Klyden I said hi.

08:12.117 --> 08:13.986
I will deliver the message.

08:17.790 --> 08:19.358
You think something's up
with him?

08:19.392 --> 08:21.660
I don't know.
(sighs)

08:29.468 --> 08:30.836
(sighs)

08:47.486 --> 08:50.189
Begin Simulation Bortus 497.

09:00.199 --> 09:01.600
(key opens heavy door)

09:08.173 --> 09:09.875
Your supper, prisoner.

09:11.210 --> 09:14.480
Please, sir,
may I have some water?

09:14.513 --> 09:16.749
Very well.

09:22.221 --> 09:24.223
(water sloshes)

09:34.967 --> 09:38.504
(laughing)

09:38.537 --> 09:41.707
I beg you to release me
from this dungeon.

09:41.740 --> 09:43.276
I have done nothing wrong.

09:43.309 --> 09:45.678
What is your name, prisoner?

09:45.711 --> 09:48.681
Cheston.
My name is Cheston.

09:48.714 --> 09:52.885
How badly do you want to get out
of this prison, Cheston?

09:52.918 --> 09:54.520
Very badly.

09:54.553 --> 09:56.289
I am to be executed
in the morning.

09:56.322 --> 10:01.294
Perhaps we can make
an arrangement.

10:01.327 --> 10:04.963
No, I cannot.
I am a virgin in that way.

10:04.997 --> 10:07.766
Then you shall die
in the morning, Cheston!

10:09.167 --> 10:11.304
Wait.

10:12.605 --> 10:14.873
If there is no other way,

10:14.907 --> 10:17.910
then I suppose I must do
what you ask of me.

10:19.912 --> 10:21.914
And more.

10:29.922 --> 10:31.924
*

10:40.666 --> 10:42.735
Klyden,

10:42.768 --> 10:44.737
I am sorry to be late.

10:44.770 --> 10:46.572
There was an unidentified
power surge

10:46.605 --> 10:48.741
in the bridge tactical console,
and I had no choice...

10:48.774 --> 10:50.943
I do not care about
your excuses.

10:50.976 --> 10:53.679
I have been waiting for you
for hours.

10:53.712 --> 10:55.914
This was supposed to be
my night with you.

10:55.948 --> 10:57.516
It could not be helped.

10:57.550 --> 10:59.352
We will talk about this
tomorrow.

10:59.385 --> 11:01.820
The captain requires my presence
on the bridge at 0800.

11:01.854 --> 11:03.822
I must go to bed.

11:09.362 --> 11:11.597
You have ruined
our night together.

11:11.630 --> 11:14.333
Let us at least share
the sexual event

11:14.367 --> 11:17.269
so that we may salvage what
little is left of the evening.

11:17.302 --> 11:20.573
I am sorry, I am too tired.

11:28.647 --> 11:30.683
(sighs)

11:57.209 --> 11:58.677
(weapon unsheathes)

12:00.679 --> 12:02.748
(screaming)

12:12.958 --> 12:15.594
20 milligrams of benoctaline.

12:19.297 --> 12:21.266
Increase metabolic support
to level eight.

12:21.299 --> 12:22.401
Come on, Bortus.

12:22.435 --> 12:24.470
(alarm blaring)

12:25.771 --> 12:27.005
Sonic defibrillation at maximum.

12:27.039 --> 12:28.441
-Doctor, he's...
-Do it.

12:29.708 --> 12:31.777
-Clear.
-(electrical discharge)

12:34.246 --> 12:35.814
Again.

12:37.382 --> 12:39.284
(electrical discharge)

12:39.317 --> 12:41.854
(gasps)

12:41.887 --> 12:43.856
There he is.

12:43.889 --> 12:45.891
(panting)

12:47.760 --> 12:50.295
Is he gonna be okay?

12:50.328 --> 12:52.731
I think so. Lost him there
for a couple of seconds,

12:52.765 --> 12:55.100
but he's stabilized.

12:55.133 --> 12:58.871
I am alive.

12:58.904 --> 13:01.339
Yeah, you are,
thanks to Dr. Finn.

13:02.741 --> 13:04.477
You saved my life.

13:04.510 --> 13:05.744
That's my job.

13:05.778 --> 13:08.614
You should not have done that.

13:08.647 --> 13:10.282
Excuse me?

13:10.315 --> 13:11.584
Bortus, I don't know
if you're aware,

13:11.617 --> 13:13.652
but Klyden just tried
to murder you.

13:13.686 --> 13:16.288
He's in the brig now, but if
Alara hadn't heard you scream...

13:16.321 --> 13:18.090
Klyden is in the brig?

13:18.123 --> 13:20.392
He should not be there.
He has done nothing wrong.

13:20.425 --> 13:23.596
What do you call plunging
a dagger into your chest?

13:23.629 --> 13:27.600
Klyden was divorcing me.

13:27.633 --> 13:28.801
Divorcing you?

13:28.834 --> 13:31.904
When a Moclan wishes
to end a marriage,

13:31.937 --> 13:34.607
he terminates
the life of his mate.

13:34.640 --> 13:37.610
-You're kidding.
-I did not realize

13:37.643 --> 13:39.945
he was this unhappy.

13:39.978 --> 13:41.580
CLAIRE:
Wait a minute. You're saying

13:41.614 --> 13:44.750
any time somebody on your planet
wants a divorce,

13:44.783 --> 13:46.752
they just murder their spouse?

13:46.785 --> 13:48.353
That is correct.

13:48.386 --> 13:50.856
You should not have revived me.

13:50.889 --> 13:53.626
Commander, I am not in the habit
of letting my patients

13:53.659 --> 13:55.427
bleed to death
on the operating table.

13:55.460 --> 13:58.764
Doctor, it is our way.

13:58.797 --> 14:00.633
It may be your way on Moclus,

14:00.666 --> 14:03.502
but ritual murder
isn't gonna fly on a Union ship.

14:03.536 --> 14:04.970
Captain,
you must release Klyden.

14:05.003 --> 14:06.304
Out of the question.

14:06.338 --> 14:08.674
Please.

14:14.813 --> 14:17.716
I don't envy you with this
predicament, Captain Mercer,

14:17.750 --> 14:19.284
but the Admiralty will approve

14:19.317 --> 14:21.353
your recommended handling
of the situation.

14:21.386 --> 14:22.621
All right, thank you, Admiral.

14:22.655 --> 14:24.156
Mercer out.

14:24.189 --> 14:25.791
Why the hell is dealing

14:25.824 --> 14:27.793
with Moclan culture
always this difficult?

14:27.826 --> 14:29.194
They mutilate
their female babies.

14:29.227 --> 14:30.963
They kill each other
when they want a divorce.

14:30.996 --> 14:32.565
What do they do
when it's someone's birthday?

14:32.598 --> 14:34.199
Light the parents on fire?

14:34.232 --> 14:36.368
I know we're supposed to be
tolerant of alien customs,

14:36.401 --> 14:38.737
but man,
there's got to be a limit.

14:38.771 --> 14:42.040
-Day drink?
-Day drink.

14:45.343 --> 14:47.112
Two Xelayan Blossom Whiskeys.

14:57.522 --> 14:59.524
(whooshing)

15:03.896 --> 15:05.864
ISAAC (over comm):
Bridge to captain.

15:05.898 --> 15:07.432
Go ahead.

15:07.465 --> 15:09.868
I have been monitoring the decay
of the planet,

15:09.902 --> 15:11.937
and my scans have revealed
something rather significant.

15:11.970 --> 15:13.906
What is it?

15:13.939 --> 15:16.675
The dysonium we detected
beneath the surface

15:16.709 --> 15:19.444
may, in fact, not be natural.
There are indications

15:19.477 --> 15:22.948
that a subterranean civilization
may once have existed.

15:22.981 --> 15:25.951
I would say
that's absolutely significant.

15:25.984 --> 15:28.453
And one hell
of an archaeological find.

15:28.486 --> 15:29.955
Is there any way
we can investigate?

15:29.988 --> 15:31.757
If you are inquiring
about the possibility

15:31.790 --> 15:33.959
of sending down a landing party,

15:33.992 --> 15:35.794
that is
a poorly conceived notion.

15:35.828 --> 15:38.263
It would be
exceedingly hazardous

15:38.296 --> 15:39.965
due to the planet's proximity
to the star

15:39.998 --> 15:41.700
and its imminent breakup.

15:41.734 --> 15:43.268
Damn, what a huge loss.

15:43.301 --> 15:45.738
Who knows what kinds of
artifacts could be down there?

15:45.771 --> 15:47.072
All right, well,
continue scanning,

15:47.105 --> 15:48.573
and keep me apprised.

15:48.607 --> 15:49.875
I'll try not to bother you

15:49.908 --> 15:52.778
with any more
poorly conceived notions.

15:52.811 --> 15:55.648
Thank you, sir. I am very busy.

15:55.681 --> 15:56.949
What a dick.

15:56.982 --> 15:59.284
He's a glorified Speak & Spell.
Screw him.

15:59.317 --> 16:01.820
-(door chimes)
-Come in.

16:05.791 --> 16:07.225
KELLY:
Bortus.

16:07.259 --> 16:08.627
What are you doing
out of sickbay?

16:08.661 --> 16:10.062
He insisted on coming,
Commander.

16:10.095 --> 16:13.131
You can expect a formal protest
from Dr. Finn.

16:13.165 --> 16:14.633
All right, both of you
have a seat.

16:16.702 --> 16:18.771
Thanks, Alara.

16:18.804 --> 16:21.840
Sir, if you don't mind,
I'd like to stick around,

16:21.874 --> 16:25.243
just in case
there's another divorce.

16:25.277 --> 16:27.780
Fair enough. All right.

16:27.813 --> 16:30.015
Because of the cultural element
in play here,

16:30.048 --> 16:33.686
and because Bortus apparently
does not want to press charges,

16:33.719 --> 16:35.988
Klyden will not be prosecuted.

16:36.021 --> 16:38.757
-(exhales)
-However, people can't
just go around

16:38.791 --> 16:41.259
stabbing each other
on a Union ship.

16:41.293 --> 16:44.629
So, Klyden, due to your
reckless actions in the assault

16:44.663 --> 16:47.532
of a Union officer,
you are ordered to disembark

16:47.565 --> 16:50.035
from the Orville
at the next Union outpost.

16:50.068 --> 16:52.805
Captain, please,
I beg you not to do this.

16:52.838 --> 16:55.373
I must add my voice
to his plea, Captain.

16:55.407 --> 16:57.009
Bortus, he tried to kill you.

16:57.042 --> 17:00.212
As I have said,
he was following Moclan custom.

17:00.245 --> 17:03.481
-He is still my mate.
-We will make
our relationship work.

17:03.515 --> 17:05.017
We will not fail as you did.

17:05.050 --> 17:07.485
-Klyden!
-KLYDEN: I-I apologize.

17:07.519 --> 17:10.522
Please, Captain,
give me a second chance.

17:10.555 --> 17:12.657
I swear on the soul of my child,

17:12.691 --> 17:15.660
I will never commit a violent
act on this ship again.

17:15.694 --> 17:17.629
Bortus, you're really okay
with this?

17:17.662 --> 17:21.666
Yes, Captain.
Klyden and I stand united.

17:21.700 --> 17:24.202
This is... this is insane.

17:24.236 --> 17:26.805
This... I-I can't have a normal
ship, with normal people?

17:26.839 --> 17:29.007
It's like, it's got to be
all stabby and-and...

17:29.041 --> 17:30.876
All right, you know what?
Fine. You can stay.

17:30.909 --> 17:32.544
Thank you, Captain.

17:32.577 --> 17:34.412
But there are two conditions.

17:34.446 --> 17:38.150
One: Bortus, you are relieved
of duty until I'm satisfied

17:38.183 --> 17:40.352
this has all been worked out.

17:40.385 --> 17:42.254
And you will both attend
daily couples counseling

17:42.287 --> 17:43.722
with Dr. Finn.

17:43.756 --> 17:47.559
What is couples counseling?

17:49.694 --> 17:52.664
CLAIRE: Do either of you
understand why you're here?

17:52.697 --> 17:54.566
Because the captain
has ordered it.

17:54.599 --> 17:56.268
Technically, yes.

17:56.301 --> 17:58.436
But do you know why
the captain has ordered you

17:58.470 --> 18:00.105
to attend couples counseling?

18:00.138 --> 18:02.407
So I do not stab Bortus again.

18:02.440 --> 18:04.576
That is one of our goals, yes.

18:04.609 --> 18:06.211
Klyden has already
told the captain

18:06.244 --> 18:08.213
he will not commit
another violent act.

18:08.246 --> 18:09.714
What more is there to do?

18:09.748 --> 18:11.383
Why don't I explain what

18:11.416 --> 18:14.219
couples counseling is first, and
that might answer your question.

18:14.252 --> 18:18.190
Couples counseling helps married
people, such as yourselves,

18:18.223 --> 18:21.093
discuss and resolve conflicts
with the goal of improving

18:21.126 --> 18:23.228
your long-term relationship.

18:23.261 --> 18:25.764
I'm here to guide that process.

18:25.798 --> 18:28.033
Will we select our own weapons?

18:28.066 --> 18:30.102
No. That's not how it works.

18:30.135 --> 18:32.771
Let me see.
How can I reframe this?

18:32.805 --> 18:34.873
It's like a peace conference.

18:34.907 --> 18:38.076
You and Klyden
are the warring factions

18:38.110 --> 18:40.913
during a cease-fire,
and I'm the diplomat.

18:40.946 --> 18:42.781
I believe I understand.

18:42.815 --> 18:44.582
-As do I.
-Good.

18:44.616 --> 18:47.886
So let's start
the peace process, shall we?

18:47.920 --> 18:50.755
Klyden, tell me
why you tried to kill Bortus.

18:50.789 --> 18:52.724
Because I wished to divorce him.

18:52.757 --> 18:54.592
Dig deeper than that.

18:54.626 --> 18:56.661
How do you feel about Bortus?

18:56.694 --> 18:59.764
I feel Bortus does not wish
to be with me.

18:59.798 --> 19:02.500
That he does not find me
attractive anymore.

19:02.534 --> 19:04.602
Bortus, how would you like
to respond

19:04.636 --> 19:05.804
to what Klyden is saying?

19:05.838 --> 19:08.273
I still find Klyden attractive,

19:08.306 --> 19:10.742
but I have been working
long hours lately,

19:10.775 --> 19:12.978
and I am tired
when I return to our quarters.

19:13.011 --> 19:15.013
Okay, that's reasonable.

19:15.047 --> 19:19.284
Klyden, do you understand
and accept Bortus's explanation?

19:20.318 --> 19:21.486
I suppose I do.

19:21.519 --> 19:22.955
-Yes.
-Good.

19:22.988 --> 19:24.857
Now we're gonna try
a little exercise

19:24.890 --> 19:26.992
I call "I statements."

19:27.025 --> 19:29.828
Bortus, face Klyden
and look him in the eyes,

19:29.862 --> 19:32.764
and tell him that you
are still attracted to him.

19:32.797 --> 19:37.102
And use "I" and your names
as much as possible.

19:37.135 --> 19:39.104
Klyden.

19:39.137 --> 19:43.808
I, Bortus, am still
attracted to you, Klyden.

19:43.842 --> 19:47.379
Good. Now, Klyden, I want you
to look Bortus in the eyes

19:47.412 --> 19:48.881
and accept what he has told you.

19:50.849 --> 19:54.987
Bortus. I, Klyden,
accept that you,

19:55.020 --> 19:58.556
Bortus, are still
attracted to me, Klyden.

19:58.590 --> 20:00.859
Great.
Now, when we're done today,

20:00.893 --> 20:03.161
I have two homework assignments
for you.

20:03.195 --> 20:05.297
First, make a fun list.

20:05.330 --> 20:08.733
Write down ten fun things
you both like doing,

20:08.766 --> 20:11.669
and try to check off
one thing every week.

20:11.703 --> 20:15.307
This fun list excites me.

20:15.340 --> 20:16.808
We will make one.

20:16.841 --> 20:18.376
Second, Bortus,

20:18.410 --> 20:20.645
I need you to set aside
one hour a day

20:20.678 --> 20:23.381
that's just for Klyden.

20:23.415 --> 20:25.250
Does that sound reasonable?

20:25.283 --> 20:27.852
Yes. One hour per day.

20:27.886 --> 20:31.023
Okay. I think
we're making some progress.

20:34.726 --> 20:37.395
The couples counseling
was quite productive.

20:37.429 --> 20:40.198
Shall we make our fun list
over dinner tonight?

20:40.232 --> 20:41.733
Yes.

20:41.766 --> 20:44.236
I must brief the captain
on a number of maintenance items

20:44.269 --> 20:46.438
that require attention
while I am off duty.

20:46.471 --> 20:49.674
I will meet you
in our quarters at 1800 hours.

20:49.707 --> 20:51.709
I shall see you there.

21:01.053 --> 21:04.389
Begin Simulation Bortus 931.

21:20.172 --> 21:21.906
Hello, Bortus.

21:21.940 --> 21:23.441
I am Dr. Gulnar.

21:23.475 --> 21:25.143
How can I help you today?

21:25.177 --> 21:29.447
I have a pain in my ear, and I
do not know what is causing it.

21:29.481 --> 21:31.483
Hmm. I see.

21:31.516 --> 21:33.952
Why don't you take off your gown
and we will have a look.

21:39.924 --> 21:42.660
Could you please turn around
and lean on the table?

21:42.694 --> 21:44.496
I will begin the examination.

21:53.972 --> 21:57.142
I think I may have found
the problem.

21:57.175 --> 22:00.178
Is the pain subsiding?

22:05.817 --> 22:08.353
(sighs)
End simulation.

22:10.955 --> 22:13.191
(sighs)

22:14.659 --> 22:17.795
(door whooshes open, shut)

22:23.668 --> 22:26.004
Lieutenant.
May I speak with you?

22:35.680 --> 22:39.451
I am told your people
are known for creating

22:39.484 --> 22:42.554
some of the most sought-after
pornographic simulations

22:42.587 --> 22:44.022
in the galaxy.

22:48.393 --> 22:49.427
Lower your voice.

22:51.029 --> 22:53.165
Could you obtain
a simulation for me?

22:55.667 --> 22:58.870
I require something
out of the ordinary.

23:07.945 --> 23:09.581
No. Something simpler.

23:09.614 --> 23:11.683
I just do not want to be bored.

23:13.718 --> 23:16.088
Moclans. Many of them.

23:16.121 --> 23:20.725
All at once,
ready to be adventurous.

23:23.195 --> 23:24.962
What?

23:32.737 --> 23:34.872
Are you sure there's
no mistake about this?

23:34.906 --> 23:38.410
I have reanalyzed
the scanner logs multiple times.

23:38.443 --> 23:41.446
The subterranean civilization
is still active.

23:41.479 --> 23:43.348
How the hell can anything
be alive down there?

23:43.381 --> 23:45.250
Alara, is there any way
we can hail them?

23:45.283 --> 23:48.653
There's a lot of interference
from the star, but I can try.

23:50.555 --> 23:54.559
I have a link. It's audio only,
old-style shortwave,

23:54.592 --> 23:56.228
but the channel's open.

23:56.261 --> 23:57.895
(channel beeps)

23:57.929 --> 24:00.632
To anyone below the surface who
can hear the sound of my voice,

24:00.665 --> 24:03.301
this is Captain Ed Mercer
of the starship Orville.

24:03.335 --> 24:04.769
Please respond.

24:04.802 --> 24:08.106
FEMALE (over comm):
Did you say a starship?

24:08.140 --> 24:10.875
Yes. We're in orbit
around your planet.

24:10.908 --> 24:12.377
Who am I speaking to?

24:12.410 --> 24:14.146
This is Hallan Theece,

24:14.179 --> 24:15.780
First Minister
of the Nyxian people.

24:15.813 --> 24:17.315
But where have you come from?

24:17.349 --> 24:19.884
Many different places, actually.

24:19.917 --> 24:21.753
I'm from a planet called Earth.

24:21.786 --> 24:23.721
THEECE:
Another planet.

24:23.755 --> 24:25.590
How is that even possible?

24:25.623 --> 24:28.760
Our scientists always speculated
about such things, but...

24:28.793 --> 24:30.962
Minister Theeze, are you aware
of what's happening to...

24:30.995 --> 24:32.897
-I think she said Theece.
-Huh?

24:32.930 --> 24:34.766
I think she said Theece,
with a short "S" sound.

24:34.799 --> 24:36.768
-What did I say?
-Theeze.

24:36.801 --> 24:37.902
What's the difference?

24:37.935 --> 24:39.837
-Theece, like peace.
-Like "Theece's Pieces."

24:40.838 --> 24:43.241
Hey, you know what, guys, this
woman's planet is about to die.

24:43.275 --> 24:44.909
Maybe we focus on that, huh?

24:44.942 --> 24:47.945
Minister, are you aware of
what's happening to your world?

24:47.979 --> 24:49.781
THEECE:
Yes. A century ago,

24:49.814 --> 24:52.350
we discovered that our sun
was going to engulf Nyxia

24:52.384 --> 24:54.085
within 100 years.

24:54.118 --> 24:55.787
We have no method
of space travel,

24:55.820 --> 24:58.290
so we sought refuge underground.

24:58.323 --> 24:59.957
This is Commander Kelly Grayson.

24:59.991 --> 25:01.959
Minister, how many of you
are there?

25:01.993 --> 25:05.630
THEECE: 75 is all that is left
of our civilization.

25:05.663 --> 25:09.033
We are...
awaiting the inevitable.

25:09.066 --> 25:10.835
We want to help you if we can.

25:10.868 --> 25:12.670
Our scans indicate
that your planet

25:12.704 --> 25:15.173
won't begin to disintegrate
for another 24 hours.

25:15.207 --> 25:16.808
THEECE:
So soon.

25:16.841 --> 25:20.011
That's... that's not much time.

25:20.044 --> 25:21.779
We're working on it.
We'll contact you

25:21.813 --> 25:23.681
when we have more information.
Mercer out.

25:23.715 --> 25:25.383
What are our options?

25:25.417 --> 25:27.018
Well, we need
a Union evac vessel.

25:27.051 --> 25:29.120
Something that can go down there
and pick them up.

25:29.153 --> 25:30.788
There's no time.
We're too far out.

25:30.822 --> 25:32.357
How about a shuttle?

25:32.390 --> 25:34.792
A shuttle is too small
to withstand

25:34.826 --> 25:37.729
the gravitational stress
of the star at such close range.

25:37.762 --> 25:39.797
What if we fortified the crap
out of the deflectors?

25:39.831 --> 25:41.866
Divert all power
but life support?

25:41.899 --> 25:43.801
We could move the Orville
into a closer orbit,

25:43.835 --> 25:45.237
minimize the shuttle's
flight time.

25:45.270 --> 25:46.671
It is possible.

25:46.704 --> 25:47.972
75 people, we'd have to make

25:48.005 --> 25:50.041
two or three trips
to get them all out.

25:50.074 --> 25:51.743
All right, let's make it happen.

26:08.293 --> 26:10.562
-Hi, Commander.
-Hi!

26:15.267 --> 26:17.569
Your people work fast.
Thank you.

26:26.711 --> 26:28.780
No.

26:36.921 --> 26:38.923
(birds singing)

26:58.276 --> 26:59.544
How soon before
the shuttle's ready?

26:59.577 --> 27:00.878
-About nine hours.
-Okay, well,

27:00.912 --> 27:03.147
make sure you do the job right,
because you know

27:03.180 --> 27:05.817
who the captain's going to ask
to pilot the thing.

27:07.619 --> 27:09.587
Two slices of pepperoni pizza.

27:12.290 --> 27:15.226
Oh, God! What is that?

27:15.259 --> 27:17.795
Sure as hell isn't pizza.

27:17.829 --> 27:20.398
Ugh... Lamar to engineering.

27:20.432 --> 27:22.467
Send a technician
to the mess hall.

27:22.500 --> 27:24.802
And something to scoop up with.

27:37.815 --> 27:40.184
I hope you are pleased, Bortus.

27:40.217 --> 27:43.187
It is our wish
to bring you pleasure.

27:43.220 --> 27:45.757
I am very pleased.

27:45.790 --> 27:48.793
I do not want this to end.

27:48.826 --> 27:51.028
Then do not end it.

28:02.239 --> 28:04.976
-Bortus!
-Klyden!

28:07.879 --> 28:11.649
Klyden, wait! Wait!

28:27.865 --> 28:31.669
Bortus, do you understand
what a porn addiction is?

28:32.704 --> 28:34.572
I believe so.

28:34.606 --> 28:36.474
You disgust me, Bortus.

28:36.508 --> 28:39.043
If I had not promised
the captain otherwise,

28:39.076 --> 28:41.846
I would stab you again
right now.

28:41.879 --> 28:43.548
Klyden, I understand
that you're upset,

28:43.581 --> 28:45.049
and you have every right to be.

28:45.082 --> 28:48.520
But porn addiction is a disease,
just like any other.

28:48.553 --> 28:50.087
So we need to treat
his condition

28:50.121 --> 28:52.724
with compassion
and understanding.

28:52.757 --> 28:55.860
Is there an injection I can
receive to cure this disease?

28:55.893 --> 28:58.730
-You have had enough injections.
-CLAIRE: Klyden, please.

28:58.763 --> 29:00.498
That's not going to help
resolve this.

29:00.532 --> 29:02.734
Bortus, do you remember
when your compulsion

29:02.767 --> 29:05.369
to visit the simulator began?

29:07.739 --> 29:10.708
Klyden, do you recall
when Bortus began

29:10.742 --> 29:12.276
losing interest in sex?

29:12.309 --> 29:14.912
It was not long after
Topa underwent the procedure

29:14.946 --> 29:16.514
to become a male.

29:16.548 --> 29:18.583
He is correct.

29:18.616 --> 29:22.386
It was around that time I first
began using the simulator

29:22.420 --> 29:24.121
for the sexual event.

29:24.155 --> 29:26.424
I see.

29:26.458 --> 29:29.427
How much have you two discussed
what happened on Moclus?

29:29.461 --> 29:32.597
We discussed it many times
since the tribunal.

29:32.630 --> 29:33.965
We agreed to move on.

29:33.998 --> 29:37.735
-To focus on the future.
-CLAIRE: Bortus,

29:37.769 --> 29:40.805
do you feel that you have
truly moved on?

29:42.840 --> 29:45.142
Perhaps I have not.

29:45.176 --> 29:47.612
I often look at Topa,
and I wonder

29:47.645 --> 29:51.215
if I should have fought harder
to keep him female.

29:51.248 --> 29:53.551
But there was nothing more
I could have done.

29:53.585 --> 29:55.653
No one could have stopped
what happened to her

29:55.687 --> 29:58.756
except Klyden, and he did not.

30:01.793 --> 30:04.295
I resent you, Klyden.

30:04.328 --> 30:07.732
I resent what you
put our child through.

30:07.765 --> 30:12.837
And I do not know
if I can ever move on.

30:20.712 --> 30:23.247
Mercer to engineering.

30:23.280 --> 30:24.682
What's the status
of the shuttle upgrade?

30:24.716 --> 30:26.150
It's moving along, Captain.

30:26.183 --> 30:27.585
Should be done in about
ten hours, give or take.

30:27.619 --> 30:30.488
Chief, that planet will be gone
in ten hours.

30:30.522 --> 30:32.624
-Make it five.
-Sir, that's impossible.

30:32.657 --> 30:34.425
Make it possible.
Mercer out.

30:34.458 --> 30:37.695
You know what I just found out
last week?

30:37.729 --> 30:40.632
The captain and I have
the same birthday.

30:42.567 --> 30:45.703
Alara, patch me through
to Minister Theece.

30:45.737 --> 30:47.705
Audio channel open.

30:47.739 --> 30:49.440
Minister, this is
Captain Mercer.

30:49.473 --> 30:51.375
-Can you hear me?
-THEECE: Yes, Captain, I'm here.

30:51.408 --> 30:52.710
ED:
I just thought I'd check in

30:52.744 --> 30:54.646
and see how things are
underground.

30:54.679 --> 30:56.514
-Any changes?
-Yes.

30:56.548 --> 30:58.382
There's been a rise
in the number of quakes,

30:58.415 --> 31:01.986
and small fissions have caused
power disruptions. And I...

31:02.019 --> 31:03.320
(static, transmission lost)

31:03.354 --> 31:05.322
Minister? Can you hear me?

31:05.356 --> 31:07.625
-Alara, what's happening?
-Checking, sir.

31:07.659 --> 31:10.061
There's no additional
interference from the planet.

31:10.094 --> 31:12.396
-It's something on our end.
-Cause?

31:12.429 --> 31:13.798
Some kind of weird glitch.

31:13.831 --> 31:15.800
It won't reinitialize.

31:15.833 --> 31:17.835
Sounds like the food
synthesizer.

31:17.869 --> 31:19.804
Thing was glitching
all over the place today.

31:19.837 --> 31:21.405
Made us a poop pizza.

31:21.438 --> 31:22.640
Isaac, run a computer
diagnostic,

31:22.674 --> 31:25.009
see if there's any connection.

31:25.042 --> 31:27.411
Scans have confirmed
the presence

31:27.444 --> 31:28.846
of a computer virus, Captain.

31:28.880 --> 31:30.381
From where?

31:30.414 --> 31:31.683
It appears its origin is

31:31.716 --> 31:33.517
Environmental Simulator 3.

31:33.551 --> 31:36.487
An unauthorized foreign program
has been uploaded.

31:36.520 --> 31:37.521
By who?

31:38.556 --> 31:41.425
Authorization 5-2-8-9-1.

31:41.458 --> 31:43.928
Commander Bortus, sir.

31:53.470 --> 31:55.807
I'm going to see if I can
access the program.

32:08.586 --> 32:11.756
Welcome to the Cove of Pleasure.

32:11.789 --> 32:16.628
Our only wish is
to bring you ecstasy.

32:16.661 --> 32:18.562
Wow.

32:22.634 --> 32:25.770
Okay, now, I know this is
awkward for all of us,

32:25.803 --> 32:27.705
but at the moment,
we need to focus on this virus.

32:27.739 --> 32:30.642
I am ashamed beyond measure,
Captain.

32:30.675 --> 32:33.377
Bortus, that is a whole other
conversation that comes later,

32:33.410 --> 32:35.647
and it's not going to be
pleasant for either of us.

32:35.680 --> 32:37.782
It's okay, dude.
Everybody does it sometimes.

32:37.815 --> 32:39.884
I went to town on myself
this morning.

32:39.917 --> 32:41.886
It's why I look so relaxed
right now.

32:41.919 --> 32:43.921
God, this whole ship is gross.

32:43.955 --> 32:45.556
Look, I need solutions,
all right?

32:45.589 --> 32:47.391
I want to know how
we stop this virus.

32:47.424 --> 32:51.095
Lieutenant Unk has provided the
origin data for the simulation.

32:51.128 --> 32:53.497
I have written a program
that should eradicate the virus

32:53.530 --> 32:55.967
before it affects any more
of the ship's systems.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.335
Good. Get it installed
as quickly as possible.

32:59.436 --> 33:01.338
Chief, is the shuttle ready?

33:01.372 --> 33:04.976
The power's been rerouted, and
we've maximized the deflectors.

33:05.009 --> 33:07.679
-What's wrong?
-CLAIRE: There's a problem.

33:07.712 --> 33:10.081
The upgraded deflectors will
block out most of the radiation,

33:10.114 --> 33:11.615
but not all of it.

33:11.649 --> 33:14.518
And anyone in the landing party
will be fully exposed

33:14.551 --> 33:16.954
when they move from the shuttle
to the subterranean access port.

33:16.988 --> 33:18.322
How bad?

33:18.355 --> 33:20.457
Like, "Ouch,
I got a sunburn bad,"

33:20.491 --> 33:22.694
or "I just opened
the Ark of the Covenant" bad?

33:22.727 --> 33:25.629
The Ark.
Like, melty-faced awfulness.

33:25.663 --> 33:28.365
So, what do we do?
How do we save those people?

33:28.399 --> 33:30.634
There are only two officers
on board who may be able

33:30.668 --> 33:32.436
to withstand the radiation:

33:32.469 --> 33:35.840
Isaac and Bortus.

33:38.209 --> 33:41.245
Well, Commander, looks like
you're back on duty.

33:54.692 --> 33:56.694
*

34:06.738 --> 34:09.340
Commander, I am curious
about something.

34:09.373 --> 34:10.674
What?

34:10.708 --> 34:13.677
Your addiction
to pornographic stimuli.

34:13.711 --> 34:15.646
My understanding
of the sexual proclivities

34:15.679 --> 34:18.549
of biological organisms
is quite fractional.

34:18.582 --> 34:20.051
I do not wish to discuss it.

34:20.084 --> 34:22.686
Is the topic of pornography
an unpleasant one

34:22.720 --> 34:26.057
due to the severe humiliation
your character has suffered

34:26.090 --> 34:29.060
and the seemingly irreversible
and very public damage

34:29.093 --> 34:31.695
it has done to your relationship
with your life-mate Klyden?

34:31.729 --> 34:33.530
I have been shamed enough.

34:33.564 --> 34:35.432
I will not answer
your questions.

34:35.466 --> 34:37.234
You need not blame yourself.

34:37.268 --> 34:39.036
You are a primitive organism.

34:39.070 --> 34:40.872
I simply wish to expand

34:40.905 --> 34:43.507
my understanding
of the behavioral impulse.

34:43.540 --> 34:45.509
You think you are smarter
than us?

34:45.542 --> 34:47.879
-Figure it out on your own.
-I am aware

34:47.912 --> 34:49.781
that billions of years
of evolution

34:49.814 --> 34:51.582
have programmed
your chemical mechanisms

34:51.615 --> 34:53.785
with a desire to breed
fruitfully.

34:53.818 --> 34:56.888
I am curious to know
how it feels.

34:59.656 --> 35:04.528
It is... a call...

35:04.561 --> 35:05.763
from deep within.

35:05.797 --> 35:09.767
Like a baby seeking
its mother's teat.

35:09.801 --> 35:15.606
It feels as if nothing else
in the world matters but...

35:15.639 --> 35:20.077
satisfying the urge
and achieving the goal

35:20.111 --> 35:23.781
my body has demanded of me.

35:23.815 --> 35:28.886
Then, as quickly as it began,
it is complete,

35:28.920 --> 35:34.125
leaving a worn-out shell
in its wake.

35:34.158 --> 35:36.760
And the only feeling
I am left with,

35:36.794 --> 35:41.232
the only thing I know,
is that...

35:41.265 --> 35:43.968
a death has occurred.

35:44.001 --> 35:46.137
I see.

35:46.170 --> 35:48.439
It is prudent
that you are in therapy.

35:48.472 --> 35:50.641
Prepare for landing.

35:56.780 --> 35:58.950
BORTUS:
There is the access port.

36:08.692 --> 36:10.828
Disengaging engines.

36:35.819 --> 36:37.821
*

36:57.774 --> 36:59.776
*

37:21.865 --> 37:24.101
Welcome to Nyxia.

37:24.135 --> 37:26.137
I'm Minister Theece.

37:34.745 --> 37:36.280
JOHN (over comm):
Lamarr to bridge.

37:36.313 --> 37:37.915
Go ahead, Chief.

37:37.949 --> 37:40.451
Commander, we got a problem.
The virus has knocked out

37:40.484 --> 37:41.752
computer interfaces
to main engineering.

37:41.785 --> 37:43.787
KELLY:
I thought Isaac took care of it.

37:43.820 --> 37:45.957
His program isn't working.
The virus is still spreading.

37:45.990 --> 37:47.758
I'm gonna try and isolate

37:47.791 --> 37:49.693
the source matrix down
in Simulator 3.

37:49.726 --> 37:51.795
Captain,
we have another problem.

37:51.828 --> 37:53.064
Oh, neat. What is it?

37:53.097 --> 37:55.199
Scans are showing
accelerated instability

37:55.232 --> 37:56.733
in the planet's core.

37:56.767 --> 37:58.970
Sir, it's breaking up.

38:07.011 --> 38:09.613
BORTUS: We must get your people
off the planet.

38:09.646 --> 38:11.415
I assume you have
radiation suits.

38:11.448 --> 38:13.050
We do, yes.
Enough for all of us.

38:13.084 --> 38:15.452
Good. Our shuttle
will hold 30 of you,

38:15.486 --> 38:18.422
so we will need to begin loading
the first group immediately.

38:18.455 --> 38:21.325
Commander, I have
just spoken to the captain.

38:21.358 --> 38:22.826
The planet's breakup
is accelerating

38:22.859 --> 38:24.428
faster than expected.

38:24.461 --> 38:26.998
We will only have time
for one trip.

38:27.031 --> 38:29.833
But there's 75 of us.

38:31.635 --> 38:33.604
I am sorry, Minister.

38:33.637 --> 38:36.140
You will have to select
30 of your people.

38:36.173 --> 38:38.609
We will not be able
to save the others.

38:43.047 --> 38:45.716
Are you gonna save us
from the shakes?

38:50.621 --> 38:52.623
See if you can goose
the memory circuits

38:52.656 --> 38:55.326
and analyze the algorithms
of the virus.

38:55.359 --> 38:57.061
Okay, give me a minute.

39:02.299 --> 39:05.536
I wish to bring you
erotic pleasure.

39:05.569 --> 39:07.538
Oh, my God.
You got to be kidding me.

39:07.571 --> 39:09.673
Let us experience
the sexual event.

39:09.706 --> 39:12.509
I swear to God,
I'm never looking at porn again.

39:12.543 --> 39:14.478
Hi. I'm Dann.

39:16.747 --> 39:19.016
Surely, there is
a more civilized means

39:19.050 --> 39:21.685
of selecting those
who will be evacuated.

39:21.718 --> 39:25.222
I do not know,
but it is their way.

39:25.256 --> 39:28.692
A random drawing of names
is quite inefficient.

39:28.725 --> 39:31.462
It would be wiser to select
the members of the society

39:31.495 --> 39:34.031
who possess the highest degree
of intelligence.

39:34.065 --> 39:38.335
I may be a primitive organism,

39:38.369 --> 39:42.073
but I am happy
I am not like you.

39:50.381 --> 39:52.683
The lottery is finished.

39:52.716 --> 39:54.685
These 30 will go with you
to your ship.

39:59.556 --> 40:02.526
Very well. We must leave now.

40:09.633 --> 40:12.603
You could have
included yourself.

40:12.636 --> 40:14.538
You're the First Minister.

40:14.571 --> 40:16.673
You know that would be wrong.

40:16.707 --> 40:19.543
Please understand, my love.

40:19.576 --> 40:22.679
Make a life out there
with Nathius.

40:22.713 --> 40:25.582
A beautiful life
among the stars.

40:25.616 --> 40:27.784
All the days we'll never have.

40:27.818 --> 40:31.222
Your heart
is full of the days we did.

40:31.255 --> 40:34.725
That's what you take with you.

40:34.758 --> 40:36.627
(crying):
Now go.

40:39.730 --> 40:42.466
It is imperative that we depart.

41:03.454 --> 41:05.456
*

41:22.539 --> 41:23.974
We are clear.

41:24.007 --> 41:26.343
Setting course for docking.

41:51.835 --> 41:54.371
Shuttle bay reports
docking complete.

41:54.405 --> 41:56.173
All right.

41:56.207 --> 41:58.609
Gordon, move us out
to a wide orbit.

41:58.642 --> 42:00.644
Aye, sir.

42:02.846 --> 42:05.449
Captain, helm is not responding.

42:05.482 --> 42:07.784
-What?
-I've lost attitude control.

42:07.818 --> 42:10.554
The star's gravity well
is pulling us in.

42:29.506 --> 42:31.575
KELLY:
Bridge to Isaac.

42:31.608 --> 42:33.410
Your antiviral program
didn't do jack.

42:33.444 --> 42:35.412
-We've lost helm control.
-I am on my way

42:35.446 --> 42:37.648
to assist Chief Lamarr
in the simulator.

42:37.681 --> 42:40.517
-Gordon, how much time?
-I'd say six minutes

42:40.551 --> 42:41.752
and we're a baked potato.

42:46.423 --> 42:49.025
Hull temperature
is 2,500 degrees and rising.

42:49.059 --> 42:51.094
The viral matrix
keeps resetting.

42:51.127 --> 42:52.896
I can't stay ahead of it.
I need Isaac.

42:52.929 --> 42:55.699
Let me quench your thirst
for passion.

42:55.732 --> 42:56.900
I'm not thirsty.

43:03.740 --> 43:06.277
Chief, may I assist you?

43:06.310 --> 43:07.978
Yes, thank you.
Just in time. Get in there.

43:20.090 --> 43:21.358
GORDON:
Deflectors are gone.

43:21.392 --> 43:22.859
Starboard hull integrity
compromised.

43:22.893 --> 43:24.861
My God, we're burning up.

43:24.895 --> 43:26.196
All sections reporting
structural damage.

43:26.229 --> 43:27.864
Isaac, talk to me.

43:27.898 --> 43:30.066
ISAAC: I have initiated
a counter-virus.

43:30.100 --> 43:32.736
It will take a moment
to determine its effectiveness.

43:32.769 --> 43:34.305
15 seconds, Captain.

43:48.285 --> 43:50.954
(metal groaning)

43:52.756 --> 43:55.158
The virus has been eradicated.

43:55.191 --> 43:57.761
-Helm control restored!
-Get us out of here now.

44:08.271 --> 44:09.873
(exhales)

44:12.643 --> 44:14.645
(exhales)

44:14.678 --> 44:19.850
Your head is very smooth
and very sensuous.

44:30.193 --> 44:31.962
I never cease to be impressed

44:31.995 --> 44:34.598
by the resilience
of the Moclan body.

44:34.631 --> 44:37.033
Your radiation absorption
is minimal.

44:37.067 --> 44:40.471
Two or three treatments,
and you're clean.

44:40.504 --> 44:42.939
Captain. Commander.

44:42.973 --> 44:45.776
Bortus. You look good
for a guy who's been cooked.

44:45.809 --> 44:47.844
Thank you, sir.
I feel quite well.

44:47.878 --> 44:50.614
I'm glad you're well, because
I have something to say to you.

44:50.647 --> 44:53.484
I have never witnessed
an officer behave

44:53.517 --> 44:56.019
with such carelessness,
selfishness

44:56.052 --> 44:58.221
and downright stupidity
as you have.

44:58.254 --> 45:01.492
As a direct result
of your thoughtless actions,

45:01.525 --> 45:03.660
you almost destroyed
this entire ship

45:03.694 --> 45:05.662
and all 300 members of her crew.

45:05.696 --> 45:07.398
I agree, sir.

45:07.431 --> 45:10.734
I wish to tender my resignation,
effective immediately.

45:15.338 --> 45:16.573
Rejected.

45:17.674 --> 45:18.675
Sir?

45:19.743 --> 45:22.012
Your performance today

45:22.045 --> 45:24.481
exhibited tremendous
courage and valor

45:24.515 --> 45:27.017
in the finest Union tradition.

45:27.050 --> 45:30.554
You saved 30 lives
by risking your own.

45:30.587 --> 45:35.592
Porn virus aside,
I am very grateful

45:35.626 --> 45:38.094
to have you on board.

45:39.763 --> 45:42.298
Thank you, sir.

45:45.569 --> 45:46.937
Get some rest.

45:46.970 --> 45:49.740
You're back on full-time duty
in the morning.

45:51.041 --> 45:53.944
(door whooshes shut)

46:03.219 --> 46:05.188
Dr. Finn tells me

46:05.221 --> 46:09.192
you've experienced no effects
from the planet's surface.

46:09.225 --> 46:11.728
That is not entirely true.

46:11.762 --> 46:14.798
I do not understand.
Are you not well?

46:14.831 --> 46:16.132
I am fine.

46:19.570 --> 46:21.572
No.

46:21.605 --> 46:23.840
I am not fine.

46:25.275 --> 46:28.645
I have been a bad mate.

46:29.846 --> 46:33.750
I have been disrespectful.

46:33.784 --> 46:36.286
Instead of speaking
my mind aloud,

46:36.319 --> 46:39.289
I have retreated
into a fantasy world.

46:39.322 --> 46:43.660
Dr. Finn says, if you talk
about it, you get rid of it.

46:44.695 --> 46:47.163
Klyden.

46:47.197 --> 46:50.734
I do not know that I will ever
be fully at peace

46:50.767 --> 46:53.136
with what happened to Topa.

46:53.169 --> 46:57.708
But today,
I witnessed events that...

47:01.812 --> 47:06.783
I am very fortunate to have
you and Topa in my life.

47:06.817 --> 47:10.554
And I do not wish
to lose you again.

47:11.855 --> 47:14.591
I do not wish
to lose you, either.

47:14.625 --> 47:19.195
I would like our family
to be together tonight.

47:20.664 --> 47:23.700
As would I.

48:18.755 --> 48:20.757
