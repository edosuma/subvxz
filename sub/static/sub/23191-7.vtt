00:38.302 --> 00:44.933
- synced and corrected by chamallow -

00:45.686 --> 00:47.795
Bloody hell!

00:47.915 --> 00:49.988
How much longer do we have
to put up with this racket?

00:50.023 --> 00:52.597
Not too long, Sir, they just
need to break up the concrete

00:52.634 --> 00:55.570
- so they can lay the drain pipe.
- Newfangled flush toilets!

00:55.588 --> 00:58.213
The pit was good enough for me. Oh...

00:58.333 --> 01:01.075
- Do you hear that?
- What?

01:01.195 --> 01:03.901
My thoughts... I can actually hear them.

01:04.021 --> 01:07.295
- Sirs!
- Oh, good God. What now?

01:07.941 --> 01:10.716
Sirs? Sirs...

01:10.761 --> 01:12.142
You should come see this.

01:21.834 --> 01:25.209
- Who is he, Sir?
- I have no idea.

01:27.352 --> 01:31.209
Victim was adult male, ***.

01:33.944 --> 01:36.048
Ah, look what we have here.

01:36.494 --> 01:38.596
- Bullet?
- Most likely.

01:38.630 --> 01:40.209
Is that what killed him?

01:40.228 --> 01:43.501
I don't believe so, it has
been partially healed over.

01:45.335 --> 01:47.270
Ah, here we are.

01:47.305 --> 01:49.795
Cause of death was a blow to the temple.

01:49.822 --> 01:52.255
Mm. Sharp or a blunt object?

01:52.290 --> 01:54.257
Both, it would seem.

01:54.725 --> 01:56.941
Most of the force is concentrated

01:56.984 --> 01:59.518
in this small area here,
but the impact extended

01:59.546 --> 02:01.479
several inches across the skull.

02:01.969 --> 02:03.814
I'll need this brought back to the morgue,

02:03.844 --> 02:05.935
as well as all the dirt beneath it.

02:07.832 --> 02:10.237
Sir... Bit of a break, Sir.

02:10.256 --> 02:13.219
Constable Forbes remembers the
floor being poured in the summertime;

02:13.237 --> 02:15.095
Rawlings is sure it was 1881.

02:15.099 --> 02:17.289
So I checked all the construction
records for that time.

02:17.316 --> 02:19.740
- And?
- And we have a date.

02:20.646 --> 02:24.034
June 22, 1881. I was here then.

02:24.048 --> 02:26.255
- You were?
- He had your job,

02:26.289 --> 02:28.612
- station house detective.
- Well, the first order

02:28.625 --> 02:30.413
of business will be to identify the victim.

02:30.533 --> 02:32.636
Someone who worked here
must know something.

02:32.756 --> 02:34.702
We need a list of every constable

02:34.711 --> 02:36.394
and officer that worked here at that time.

02:36.421 --> 02:37.903
You think one of our own did this?

02:37.939 --> 02:40.812
Oh! Let's not be blind
to the obvious, Inspector.

02:40.839 --> 02:43.638
How else does a man end up
buried under a station house?

02:44.195 --> 02:46.482
Right. Will you be taking
over the investigation?

02:46.509 --> 02:47.590
Of course not!

02:47.710 --> 02:50.746
I was a detective at the
station house at that time,

02:50.780 --> 02:53.288
which makes me a suspect.
As are you, Inspector.

02:53.408 --> 02:55.083
Stockton, as well.

02:55.118 --> 02:56.672
The former chief constable?

02:56.708 --> 02:58.108
He was inspector here at the time.

02:58.153 --> 03:00.833
I will, of course, hold myself
available for questioning.

03:01.062 --> 03:03.305
And obviously, I want to be kept apprised

03:03.321 --> 03:05.480
of any developments.

03:09.650 --> 03:10.684
There's Hodge.

03:10.922 --> 03:14.754
- That's not Hodge!
- It is Hodge! Look at the sideburns, man.

03:15.449 --> 03:20.178
- There's the inspector.
- Ha ha, he's just a young pup!

03:20.208 --> 03:23.150
- Inspector! Come have a look at this.
- Gentlemen,

03:23.196 --> 03:26.161
I hope you're doing more than
taking a trip down memory lane.

03:26.168 --> 03:28.163
Yes, Sir, there's no
actual list of officers

03:28.180 --> 03:30.428
and constables at the
station house in June of 1881,

03:30.428 --> 03:32.352
but this photograph was
taken in May of that year.

03:32.387 --> 03:34.439
So, if we can just put
names to all these faces...

03:34.446 --> 03:37.731
- What is it?
- Sir, do you recognize this handsome young lad?

03:37.851 --> 03:40.073
Oh, my God. Ha!

03:40.102 --> 03:41.917
I remember when this was taken.

03:42.159 --> 03:44.646
- I'd only been on the force two weeks.
- You remember that?

03:45.027 --> 03:46.800
I'd just arrested Margaret.

03:46.920 --> 03:47.887
Your wife?

03:48.246 --> 03:51.237
She'd got into a tiff over
the lunch special at Maisy's.

03:51.583 --> 03:55.241
Such a tart tongue.
Full of sass, even then.

03:55.694 --> 03:58.796
Ahem... Sir, do you recognize
all of the men in this photograph?

03:58.818 --> 04:00.079
Oh, well let's see.

04:00.114 --> 04:02.734
That's Stockton, Giles,

04:03.985 --> 04:06.553
uh... Franklin, he's dead now.

04:06.838 --> 04:09.662
Gibbons... He wishes he was dead,
with that wife of his. Ha ha ha!

04:09.992 --> 04:12.209
- So, whose dog is this?
- Oh, Giles'.

04:12.223 --> 04:13.694
Bloody dog followed him everywhere.

04:13.814 --> 04:15.642
Appleby, Perkins...

04:15.762 --> 04:16.898
Of course, Hodge.

04:17.235 --> 04:19.678
Uh, I don't remember him.

04:19.798 --> 04:20.857
That's odd.

04:21.135 --> 04:22.591
I remember everyone else.

04:22.920 --> 04:24.903
Hodge! Come here.

04:24.938 --> 04:27.522
- Sir?
- Who's this bloke?

04:28.591 --> 04:31.609
- Constable Finch.
- When did he leave the force?

04:31.729 --> 04:35.256
I don't remember... sometime in the 80s.

04:40.212 --> 04:41.538
Sir...

04:42.352 --> 04:44.117
I found this in the archives.

04:44.154 --> 04:45.553
It's about Constable Finch.

04:45.558 --> 04:48.069
Apparently he was shot
while foiling a bank robbery.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.101
It's an exit wound,

04:50.135 --> 04:52.816
which means he was shot in the chest.

04:52.936 --> 04:55.606
Can you tell how long
afterward he was killed?

04:55.852 --> 04:58.925
Given the rate of bone repair, 46 months.

04:59.045 --> 05:00.782
And he was shot in February...

05:00.902 --> 05:02.959
So he died sometime that summer.

05:03.247 --> 05:04.367
Sir...

05:04.487 --> 05:08.364
Constable Finch last checked
in for work June 21, 1881.

05:08.391 --> 05:10.815
The day before the
concrete floor was poured.

05:11.858 --> 05:15.459
Well, George, I believe we
have our victim's identity.

05:15.493 --> 05:18.086
So how did he end up buried
under his own station house?

05:18.114 --> 05:19.934
That's a very good question.

05:23.670 --> 05:26.660
- Do you remember Constable Finch?
- Of course I do.

05:26.990 --> 05:30.054
Did you not think something
was awry when he disappeared?

05:30.054 --> 05:31.537
I don't even remember it.

05:31.657 --> 05:34.040
It wasn't unusual. The
pay was bad in those days,

05:34.069 --> 05:37.395
Constables would often quit
without notice to take better work.

05:37.430 --> 05:39.411
Without picking up his last pay?

05:39.431 --> 05:42.255
We were remiss, Detective, if
that's what you're getting at.

05:42.635 --> 05:45.987
Or are you suggesting
complicity on my part?

05:46.107 --> 05:49.389
- You are a suspect, Sir.
- This is complete bollocks!

05:49.645 --> 05:50.816
Anybody could have done it.

05:50.834 --> 05:52.664
Somebody could have
walked in off the street.

05:52.784 --> 05:54.726
Doesn't necessarily mean
it was one of our own.

05:54.749 --> 05:57.712
All possibilities must be
investigated, of course.

05:58.150 --> 05:59.880
However, we must remain cognizant

05:59.880 --> 06:03.127
of the probability that
this was fratricidal.

06:04.114 --> 06:06.300
So what next, Detective?

06:06.932 --> 06:09.236
We are conducting interviews
with all of the surviving

06:09.264 --> 06:10.901
constables from that time.

06:11.021 --> 06:13.928
I'll be wanting to speak with former
Chief Constable Stockton, as well.

06:13.937 --> 06:16.004
I wouldn't hold that
much hope there, Murdoch.

06:16.124 --> 06:18.504
He's away with the fairies,
from what I can gather.

06:18.539 --> 06:20.707
I'll speak with him nonetheless.

06:27.813 --> 06:29.752
There are 13 pieces in all.

06:29.770 --> 06:32.578
I found them while sifting
the dirt beneath the skeleton.

06:33.026 --> 06:35.355
It appears to be a negative of some sort.

06:35.389 --> 06:36.868
Could it predate the burial?

06:36.877 --> 06:39.401
Two of the fragments were
found in remnants of silk.

06:39.521 --> 06:42.365
- It was in his pocket.
- That was my supposition.

06:42.485 --> 06:44.203
Well, judging by the number of pieces,

06:44.212 --> 06:46.618
it was struck with a considerable force,

06:46.645 --> 06:48.703
perhaps a struggle?

06:48.913 --> 06:51.977
Or a plain, old-fashioned beating.

06:53.020 --> 06:55.179
Do you know anyone who might have been on

06:55.179 --> 06:57.008
unfriendly terms with
Constable Finch? I mean,

06:57.027 --> 06:59.853
not enemies, per se, but may
have been rubbed the wrong way?

06:59.899 --> 07:01.187
What I want to know is,

07:01.223 --> 07:03.477
what was Inspector Brackenreid
like as a constable?

07:03.597 --> 07:05.065
George, Henry.

07:06.097 --> 07:07.952
How are the interviews coming along?

07:07.987 --> 07:10.158
- Not much to tell, Sir.
- Everybody remembers Finch.

07:10.187 --> 07:11.980
Some people remember that he left suddenly.

07:12.100 --> 07:13.669
No one suspected foul play?

07:13.816 --> 07:17.028
No. Uh, Cavell said that Finch didn't
have any family here in the city,

07:17.065 --> 07:19.378
which would explain why
nobody reported him missing.

07:19.498 --> 07:22.085
Does anyone remember anything
from the day in question?

07:22.268 --> 07:23.658
Not as yet, Sir.

07:23.778 --> 07:25.400
And you've made contact with everyone?

07:25.407 --> 07:27.075
Everybody still alive and in town.

07:27.111 --> 07:28.787
It's hard work tracking them down, Sir.

07:28.842 --> 07:31.897
Is it ever! We found Grimsby
living in a shack by the river.

07:31.919 --> 07:33.799
We're still waiting for
Appleby and Perkins to show up.

07:33.919 --> 07:36.160
- They shared a beat with Finch.
- I see.

07:36.594 --> 07:39.141
George, complete the remaining interviews.

07:39.261 --> 07:41.319
Henry, I have a different job for you.

07:43.388 --> 07:46.557
These are the remnants of a glass negative.

07:46.592 --> 07:49.238
I need you to recreate that negative.

07:49.358 --> 07:51.902
You want me to put all
these pieces together, Sir?

07:51.930 --> 07:53.233
Yes, but handle them carefully.

07:53.263 --> 07:55.948
- This could be very important.
- Stockton's here.

07:56.167 --> 07:58.120
- Oh right, I'll just...
- He's in your office.

07:58.142 --> 08:01.414
Hodge! HODGE!

08:05.013 --> 08:06.060
Hello, Sir.

08:06.308 --> 08:07.472
Ah,

08:07.969 --> 08:09.608
Tommy Two-Cakes!

08:10.340 --> 08:13.716
- "Two-Cakes"?
- Never call me that.

08:13.751 --> 08:15.476
- Ah...
- Where's my tea?

08:15.989 --> 08:18.009
- Tea, Sir?
- Just get him some tea, Hodge,

08:18.022 --> 08:19.618
plenty of sugar.

08:20.592 --> 08:22.290
Why are you out of uniform?

08:22.648 --> 08:25.699
Uh, Sir, it's 1902.

08:25.819 --> 08:28.364
Tommy Two-Cakes is the inspector here, now.

08:28.964 --> 08:30.933
Oh, dear God, uh...

08:30.968 --> 08:33.427
I'm sorry, uh... Ahem.

08:33.888 --> 08:37.269
This must be your desk, Detective.

08:37.313 --> 08:41.073
- Shall we use my office, Sir?
- Yes, yes.

08:41.798 --> 08:43.511
Make that the last time!

08:43.912 --> 08:46.569
Yes, yes, yes...

08:47.083 --> 08:49.100
After you, Sir.

08:50.395 --> 08:51.610
Oh...

08:52.553 --> 08:53.841
Ah!

08:54.134 --> 08:58.026
I'm so glad to see Nelly
still standing guard.

08:58.061 --> 08:59.453
Nelly, Sir?

09:00.375 --> 09:03.431
It's the station mascot. Where's
your sense of history, man?

09:03.465 --> 09:05.855
We all pass through Station House Number 4.

09:05.975 --> 09:08.892
Only Nelly stays. She's seen it all.

09:08.921 --> 09:11.109
Maybe she could shed some
light on what happened.

09:11.709 --> 09:12.756
What happened?

09:12.808 --> 09:15.449
Uh, Sir, why don't you have a seat?

09:16.412 --> 09:17.915
Oh, I thank you.

09:18.368 --> 09:20.205
Chief Constable,

09:20.249 --> 09:23.168
do you remember a Constable Finch?

09:24.522 --> 09:25.474
Finch?

09:26.022 --> 09:27.486
Ach, I love the boy!

09:27.530 --> 09:28.708
What's he up to?

09:29.132 --> 09:31.130
Um... Well, Sir, he's dead.

09:32.725 --> 09:34.095
Did I know that?

09:34.357 --> 09:36.428
No, no, this is recent news.

09:36.442 --> 09:37.737
He was found buried.

09:37.857 --> 09:39.499
- ... In the basement.
- Dear God!

09:39.534 --> 09:41.206
Sir, we believe he was killed

09:41.228 --> 09:43.885
on June 21, 1881.

09:44.005 --> 09:46.421
- June 21?
- Now, I don't expect you

09:46.541 --> 09:48.290
- to remember the date...
- He wanted to talk to me!

09:48.985 --> 09:52.412
- You remember?
- Yeah, it was my wedding anniversary.

09:52.767 --> 09:55.915
Well, I didn't have time. I
told him to come back tomorrow.

09:55.950 --> 09:58.285
Well, Sir, what did Finch
want to talk to you about?

09:58.482 --> 10:01.006
- Who?
- Sir.

10:01.322 --> 10:06.685
Oh! Ah, nothing like
a hot cup of tea! Oh...

10:07.097 --> 10:10.096
Ah, you're a good man, Dodger.

10:13.141 --> 10:14.504
"Dodger"?

10:15.016 --> 10:18.977
Yes, he worked with
what's-his-name. You know...

10:19.992 --> 10:22.498
- The detective. What...
- Giles?

10:22.526 --> 10:25.511
Giles, that's him. Imperious bugger.

10:25.545 --> 10:27.794
Oh, he was purer than Jesus.

10:27.803 --> 10:29.257
Did you know,

10:29.377 --> 10:32.372
he once came into my
office before I retired,

10:32.386 --> 10:34.055
and he was talking about how Murdoch

10:34.509 --> 10:37.809
let a confessed murderer just out of jail.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.397
Can you believe that?

10:39.668 --> 10:41.431
Hmm? Murdoch!

10:43.641 --> 10:47.731
Sir, do you know if Constable
Finch had any enemies?

10:47.995 --> 10:49.128
Ah...

10:49.853 --> 10:50.884
What?

10:51.250 --> 10:52.854
- Enemies?
- Fellows who would sooner

10:52.868 --> 10:54.273
pop him one than buy him a beer.

10:55.663 --> 10:57.990
Yes, yes, there were a couple.

10:59.102 --> 11:01.810
Oh... What were their names?

11:02.044 --> 11:03.419
Ah...

11:05.563 --> 11:08.490
- Tweedledum and Tweedledee.
- Appleby and Perkins!

11:08.610 --> 11:09.976
That's them.

11:10.013 --> 11:13.078
Yeah, yeah, Appleby, he popped him once,

11:13.198 --> 11:15.874
right in front of me. HA!

11:18.596 --> 11:20.597
- Sir?
- Yes, George.

11:20.632 --> 11:23.634
I've been going through the constables'
notes for the week prior to Finch's murder.

11:23.668 --> 11:25.993
- Anything interesting?
- Only how uninteresting it is, Sir.

11:26.022 --> 11:28.861
The drunkards, pickpockets,
the usual rowdies round.

11:28.981 --> 11:30.888
Have Appleby or Perkins come in yet?

11:31.008 --> 11:33.024
- Not yet, Sir.
- Right.

11:33.047 --> 11:35.967
Call me when they do, I'd like
to conduct that interview myself.

11:40.343 --> 11:42.585
- How goes it, Henry?
- Oh...

11:42.882 --> 11:44.573
Well, Sir, uh...

11:46.824 --> 11:49.074
- May I?
- Sir...

12:10.425 --> 12:12.115
Don't touch this.

12:18.321 --> 12:20.471
- Dr. Grace!
- Detective?

12:20.523 --> 12:22.205
I'll need you to do a finer sift.

12:22.236 --> 12:24.426
I'm missing an important
piece of that negative.

12:24.606 --> 12:27.043
- What size mesh?
- Quarter inch should do it.

12:27.163 --> 12:30.248
- You're going to end up with a lot of material.
- So be it.

12:33.599 --> 12:35.999
Hodge, you old bugger, you're still here!

12:36.028 --> 12:37.945
Ha! Appleby,

12:38.348 --> 12:41.209
Perkins... This is Constable Crabtree.

12:41.217 --> 12:43.471
- Thank you for coming in, gentlemen.
- Is it true?

12:43.500 --> 12:44.860
Was Finch buried in here?

12:44.876 --> 12:46.259
It appears to be the case.

12:46.379 --> 12:48.638
That explains why he suddenly buggered off.

12:48.758 --> 12:50.247
Detective Murdoch?

12:50.269 --> 12:52.216
These are former constables Albert Perkins

12:52.223 --> 12:53.535
and Ernest Appleby.

12:53.655 --> 12:55.918
Gentlemen. It's a pleasure.

12:56.038 --> 12:57.447
Let's speak in my office.

12:58.501 --> 12:59.950
I didn't punch Finch!

12:59.986 --> 13:02.160
I shoved him. He hit me.

13:02.364 --> 13:03.895
I remember it the other way around.

13:03.953 --> 13:05.870
Nobody cares what you remember.

13:05.990 --> 13:08.278
- I was the one that got hit!
- What was the fight about?

13:08.307 --> 13:10.371
Oh, who knows. They were always at it.

13:10.491 --> 13:13.206
I think he was asking
me the question, Perkins.

13:13.626 --> 13:14.951
I don't remember.

13:14.995 --> 13:17.212
Probably had something to
do with the telegraph boys.

13:17.245 --> 13:18.720
He was always beating up on them.

13:18.840 --> 13:22.396
- "Telegraph boys"?
- Yeah, you know, the street boys.

13:22.516 --> 13:23.783
That sell themselves.

13:23.834 --> 13:27.141
Finch hated the telegraph boys.
I think he was shaking them down.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.389
Could one of them have killed Finch?

13:29.424 --> 13:31.780
Well... Would have taken
more than one to do it.

13:31.787 --> 13:33.089
I mean, they're just lads.

13:33.125 --> 13:35.957
As I recall, it was one
of them that ended up dead.

13:36.077 --> 13:37.764
Oh, right you are, Bert!

13:37.815 --> 13:40.055
I believe a street boy was murdered.

13:40.765 --> 13:43.636
I always wondered if that's
why Finch up and left.

13:43.756 --> 13:45.425
You think Finch was somehow involved?

13:45.462 --> 13:47.891
Well, I know he was involved
in the investigation.

13:48.011 --> 13:50.209
Who was the detective on that case?

13:50.656 --> 13:53.279
That would have been Detective Giles.

13:53.313 --> 13:55.200
Of course I remember the case.

13:55.449 --> 13:57.649
The victim was a street boy.

13:57.684 --> 13:59.436
His throat had been slit.

13:59.927 --> 14:03.184
Carleton was his surname,
I don't remember his first.

14:03.388 --> 14:05.757
- Who killed him?
- The case was never solved.

14:05.877 --> 14:08.027
- Why is that?
- Why is it ever such?

14:08.071 --> 14:10.061
Insufficient evidence, no witnesses...

14:10.398 --> 14:13.595
Street boys don't talk to
the police. You know that.

14:13.902 --> 14:15.373
Besides, there was...

14:15.914 --> 14:17.436
How can I put this?

14:17.751 --> 14:19.339
A culture of indifference.

14:19.785 --> 14:23.139
- Were you indifferent?
- I was never indifferent to any crime.

14:24.200 --> 14:26.559
However, resources were
finite, and I had no control

14:26.578 --> 14:28.864
over their allocation.
That was Stockton's job.

14:28.984 --> 14:31.516
And he was indifferent.

14:32.074 --> 14:34.319
To this crime, at any rate.

14:40.544 --> 14:42.043
What have you, Dr. Grace?

14:42.163 --> 14:43.961
Chunks of minerals, mostly.

14:43.996 --> 14:47.291
Some are quite lovely. I
believe this one is garnet.

14:48.206 --> 14:50.601
Oh, and I found this.

14:52.752 --> 14:54.041
Cast iron?

14:54.069 --> 14:56.273
I have no idea if it's
related to the murder.

14:57.279 --> 14:59.346
- Were you able to find any...
- Yes.

14:59.392 --> 15:01.578
I found several more slivers of glass.

15:02.310 --> 15:04.651
Is that what you were looking for?

15:05.776 --> 15:07.432
Exactly.

15:13.706 --> 15:16.789
- Henry, excuse me.
- Oh... Sorry.

15:24.068 --> 15:26.570
- Where did that piece go?
- What?

15:27.205 --> 15:28.779
That... That piece, right there.

15:28.788 --> 15:31.155
- The other half of the face.
- You sure it was there, Sir?

15:31.157 --> 15:33.776
- Of course I'm sure! Who's been in here?
- Sir, just Higgins and I!

15:34.193 --> 15:36.425
And Appleby and Perkins...

15:36.545 --> 15:38.147
And Jackson,

15:38.182 --> 15:41.284
Hodge, Worsley, Jones, the Inspector...

15:41.318 --> 15:43.953
- Pretty much everybody, Sir.
- Were there any other pieces taken?

15:43.989 --> 15:47.437
- No, just the one we need!
- What's all the fuss?

15:47.474 --> 15:49.944
Sir, someone's taken a
piece of this glass negative!

15:50.064 --> 15:51.288
You think it could be the killer?

15:51.315 --> 15:54.211
Well, if it was, he's just
been in our station house!

16:00.104 --> 16:03.030
From now on, the bullpen
is off-limits to everyone,

16:03.049 --> 16:05.893
except Constables Crabtree,
Higgins, and myself.

16:06.241 --> 16:08.610
- What about me?
- Someone from this station house

16:08.629 --> 16:10.786
has deliberately foiled this investigation.

16:10.906 --> 16:14.181
- Very likely someone who was here in 1881.
- Well, it wasn't bloody me!

16:14.216 --> 16:17.600
- No exceptions, Sir.
- Fine, I'll keep out of the bullpen.

16:17.637 --> 16:19.671
But I will not stay out of this case.

16:20.500 --> 16:22.256
So where are we?

16:23.409 --> 16:26.512
At the moment, I'm looking
into the murder of Joe Carleton.

16:26.546 --> 16:28.888
- The telegraph boy?
- What's the connection?

16:29.008 --> 16:31.403
Well, Sir, Finch hated the telegraph boys,

16:31.449 --> 16:33.442
and very likely they hated him as well.

16:33.562 --> 16:35.501
And why was a negative of two men

16:35.546 --> 16:37.759
in an illicit embrace in
his pocket when he died?

16:37.790 --> 16:39.625
So who do you think took
the piece of the negative?

16:39.643 --> 16:41.756
Oh, I don't know, Sir, it
could have been any one of them.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.512
They all had access to the bullpen.

16:43.539 --> 16:45.387
Henry and George were
hardly paying attention.

16:45.507 --> 16:47.664
Sirs... Excuse me.

16:47.710 --> 16:49.100
In the Carleton case,

16:49.136 --> 16:51.844
Perkins' notes make
mention of a bloody knife.

16:51.964 --> 16:53.774
There's no sign of it in the evidence log.

16:53.805 --> 16:55.466
- Could have been removed.
- Well, if it was,

16:55.475 --> 16:58.743
it would have been removed prior
to the evidence log being compiled.

16:58.777 --> 17:02.247
- By Finch?
- Appleby seems to think Finch is involved.

17:02.281 --> 17:05.097
- Could Finch be the murderer?
- Possibly.

17:05.398 --> 17:06.853
What else do you have, George?

17:07.082 --> 17:09.597
- Just this list of names.
- Suspects?

17:09.717 --> 17:11.013
Witnesses?

17:11.344 --> 17:13.672
Third name on the list. Frank Porter.

17:13.791 --> 17:16.402
He was a street boy
himself back in the day.

17:21.340 --> 17:24.148
- Mr. Porter.
- Am I under arrest?

17:25.009 --> 17:28.838
- Why would you say that?
- You have me sitting here.

17:28.873 --> 17:31.073
I just need to ask you a few questions.

17:31.439 --> 17:34.744
- About what?
- About an old friend of yours,

17:34.779 --> 17:36.936
goes by the name of Joe Carleton.

17:39.415 --> 17:41.317
It's been a while since I heard that name.

17:42.104 --> 17:43.915
I assume you know what happened to him.

17:43.924 --> 17:46.138
Of course I know, I'm
the one who found him.

17:46.258 --> 17:50.464
Lying there, eyes wide
open, flies buzzing about.

17:51.881 --> 17:54.330
I didn't do it, if that's
what you're thinking.

17:54.662 --> 17:57.058
I'm more interested in a
policeman from that time,

17:57.370 --> 17:59.976
a Constable Finch. Did you know him?

18:02.007 --> 18:04.952
There ain't a boy from that
time that don't remember that...

18:04.979 --> 18:06.625
bastard.

18:07.119 --> 18:09.516
- He harassed you?
- Harassed us?

18:10.165 --> 18:12.058
He owned us!

18:12.095 --> 18:15.196
Every week he collected, two bits
a day, whether or not we earned it.

18:15.651 --> 18:17.629
And what happened if you didn't pay?

18:17.749 --> 18:19.028
You'd get a beating,

18:19.148 --> 18:23.097
or he'd put you in jail, and then
double your tax when you got out.

18:24.369 --> 18:26.436
And then one day he stopped collecting.

18:26.895 --> 18:30.565
- What did you think happened?
- Figured someone done him in.

18:30.600 --> 18:31.732
Who?

18:32.372 --> 18:33.607
I don't know.

18:34.110 --> 18:35.870
One of the older boys, maybe.

18:35.904 --> 18:38.071
Either that, or he
killed Joe then took off.

18:38.191 --> 18:39.050
Right.

18:39.170 --> 18:41.848
Now why would Constable
Finch kill Joe Carleton?

18:41.867 --> 18:45.412
I... I don't know. All I was
told is that a copper done it.

18:45.447 --> 18:47.153
Who told you that?

18:47.816 --> 18:50.317
- What does it matter?
- I want the name.

18:51.233 --> 18:53.254
... Peter Reid.

18:53.288 --> 18:54.946
Good luck talking to him.

18:55.066 --> 18:57.041
He died 10 years ago.

19:02.996 --> 19:04.541
Thank you.

19:20.751 --> 19:22.348
You're right, it's the same man.

19:22.383 --> 19:25.343
- What does it mean?
- I'm not sure, Sir.

19:25.463 --> 19:27.656
Peter Reid was a former street boy.

19:27.776 --> 19:30.510
He's in this photograph that
was found with Finch's body.

19:30.630 --> 19:33.474
Now, Reid also told Mr.
Porter that it was a policeman

19:33.494 --> 19:35.211
- that killed Joe Carleton.
- Copper.

19:35.449 --> 19:38.705
- Do you think it was Finch?
- Well, it would explain the anomalies in the case.

19:38.825 --> 19:41.943
Finch removed the knife before
it could be entered into evidence.

19:42.318 --> 19:44.806
But then, why did he wish
to speak with Stockton?

19:44.825 --> 19:47.473
I wouldn't pay much attention
to what Stockton has to say.

19:47.508 --> 19:49.059
Well, Sir, he's muddled in the present,

19:49.087 --> 19:51.442
but his memories of the
past seem to be clear enough.

19:51.885 --> 19:53.604
I think I should speak with him again.

19:53.650 --> 19:55.562
So, what's next?

19:58.379 --> 20:01.515
I need to find out who the
other man in this photograph is.

20:37.059 --> 20:38.111
Henry!

20:38.231 --> 20:40.882
- Sir?
- I have a job for you.

20:42.126 --> 20:43.909
I've built a device that allows

20:43.928 --> 20:46.205
for the superimposition of two images.

20:46.232 --> 20:47.385
Excellent!

20:47.505 --> 20:50.796
What I need you to do is to
superimpose the image of each

20:50.842 --> 20:53.802
of these slides over top of the image

20:53.804 --> 20:56.559
- from the glass negative.
- All right.

20:57.483 --> 20:59.695
Do you understand what
I'm asking you to do?

20:59.979 --> 21:01.872
Superimpose the images.

21:02.641 --> 21:03.903
Why?

21:04.104 --> 21:05.486
You asked me to.

21:05.705 --> 21:09.639
Henry... you're familiar with the
Bertillon system of identification?

21:09.759 --> 21:11.129
Uh... yes, every

21:11.130 --> 21:13.544
person has unique features
that can be measured.

21:13.556 --> 21:16.224
- Exactly and compared.
- Yes.

21:16.344 --> 21:17.917
What we are attempting to do

21:17.935 --> 21:20.661
is to identify the
person in this photograph

21:20.679 --> 21:22.838
by applying the Bertillon principle.

21:22.958 --> 21:26.085
What we need to do is to compare

21:26.113 --> 21:28.381
the relationship between those features

21:28.501 --> 21:31.171
to those of the constables
from this photograph.

21:31.711 --> 21:34.190
- Right.
- Now, I've created a slide

21:34.208 --> 21:36.659
for each of the constables,
and I've drilled holes

21:36.696 --> 21:39.147
at precise feature locations.

21:39.181 --> 21:41.549
All you have to do is place the slide

21:41.669 --> 21:44.886
in the tray, and as you move it forward,

21:44.921 --> 21:49.346
if the identity matches, then
the features should line up.

21:49.466 --> 21:51.275
Seems simple enough, Sir.

21:57.971 --> 21:59.883
- Ah...
- Sir,

21:59.928 --> 22:02.059
do you remember this case?

22:02.838 --> 22:05.352
Carleton... Yes.

22:05.873 --> 22:07.638
Yes, he was one of those, uh,

22:07.758 --> 22:10.077
nancy street boys.

22:10.565 --> 22:12.527
Well, Sir, is this what Constable Finch

22:12.540 --> 22:14.260
wanted to speak to you about?

22:14.380 --> 22:17.241
Yes! I, I think I...

22:17.260 --> 22:18.852
It was your wedding anniversary.

22:18.886 --> 22:21.329
- Hmm... Huh?
- Your wedding anniversary.

22:21.348 --> 22:24.237
June 21. Longest day of
the year, didn't you know?

22:25.024 --> 22:28.476
Constable Finch wanted to speak to
you, but you didn't have the time.

22:28.714 --> 22:31.965
Yes, that's right... But I asked him!

22:31.999 --> 22:34.393
"Will this take longer than two
minutes?" And he said, "Yes,"

22:34.420 --> 22:36.076
and I said, "Well, tell
me about it tomorrow."

22:36.196 --> 22:37.951
I was late, you see.

22:38.071 --> 22:40.106
It was my anniversary!

22:40.140 --> 22:43.609
What did Constable Finch
want to speak with you about?

22:43.961 --> 22:45.232
Giles.

22:45.699 --> 22:47.027
Detective Giles?

22:47.147 --> 22:49.548
Yes, yes, he had some sort of complaint,

22:49.769 --> 22:52.732
and I said to him, "Tell
me about it tomorrow."

22:53.086 --> 22:55.554
Did it have something to
do with the investigation?

22:56.217 --> 22:57.863
What investigation?

22:58.842 --> 23:02.153
- This. The Carleton case, Sir.
- The what?

23:02.646 --> 23:04.942
I'll see the inspector out, Murdoch.

23:05.164 --> 23:07.274
Come on, Sir, let's get
you a nice cup of hot tea.

23:07.394 --> 23:09.323
Well, I love tea!

23:12.171 --> 23:14.427
- Higgins!
- Get the kettle on.

23:14.812 --> 23:16.906
Inspector. Sir,

23:17.026 --> 23:19.644
- I think I have something.
- What have you, George?

23:19.678 --> 23:22.547
Sir, this is the evidence
log from the Carleton case.

23:22.581 --> 23:25.386
Now, every evidence sheet has
a number that goes in the file.

23:25.431 --> 23:27.526
This is 113. Note the date.

23:28.120 --> 23:31.028
- June 16.
- The day after Carleton was killed.

23:31.148 --> 23:35.660
Now, this is the sheet from a
subsequent case. Note the date here.

23:36.050 --> 23:37.413
June 23.

23:37.440 --> 23:40.760
- But the recorded number is...
- ... 112.

23:40.880 --> 23:44.168
- So it came before the Carleton log.
- But it's dated afterward.

23:44.202 --> 23:46.852
Sir, this one has to be a fake.

23:47.913 --> 23:50.382
- Who signed it?
- Constable Finch.

23:50.502 --> 23:54.678
Interesting that he was able to sign this
document at least two days after his murder.

23:54.712 --> 23:57.581
Somebody cooked the evidence
here, Sir, and it wasn't Finch.

23:58.559 --> 24:00.751
- Very good. Thank you.
- Sir.

24:16.294 --> 24:18.132
Did you see anything?

24:22.020 --> 24:23.620
Hey?

24:41.940 --> 24:44.159
Today, not tomorrow,
I'm not increasing it...

24:44.190 --> 24:47.885
What's that? Later, after.

24:52.675 --> 24:56.462
- Bloody hell!
- Sir, turn off the light!

25:02.461 --> 25:04.986
I believe I've found
the scene of the crime.

25:05.763 --> 25:07.281
Henry!

25:07.602 --> 25:10.593
Henry, put in Chief Constable Stockton.

25:13.273 --> 25:15.953
- He has a moustache, Sir.
- He could have shaved it off.

25:21.599 --> 25:24.014
- The holes don't line up.
- It's not him.

25:24.032 --> 25:26.267
Murdoch, anybody could have
gotten into that office.

25:26.301 --> 25:28.802
Sir, when Chief Constable
Stockton first came in,

25:29.007 --> 25:30.804
he sat at my desk.

25:31.705 --> 25:35.977
You're right. In 1881,
Stockton had your office,

25:36.097 --> 25:38.646
and the detective had mine.

25:41.218 --> 25:44.685
Henry, put in Chief Constable Giles.

25:58.505 --> 26:02.346
George, bring in Chief Constable Giles.

26:02.370 --> 26:05.566
- On what grounds, Sir?
- Suspicion of murder.

26:19.779 --> 26:22.779
I take it there have been
developments in the case?

26:28.821 --> 26:30.453
Is this man you?

26:31.390 --> 26:33.518
It's hard to say; half the face is missing.

26:33.554 --> 26:35.548
Am I to assume you believe it to be me?

26:41.843 --> 26:44.184
Yes, very clever.

26:44.803 --> 26:46.882
So it is you in the photograph?

26:47.806 --> 26:49.846
You seem to have proven that.

26:51.346 --> 26:53.476
You are a homosexual?

26:57.345 --> 26:58.763
Yes.

27:01.114 --> 27:03.007
Did you take the shard of
glass from the negative?

27:03.025 --> 27:04.974
I've just confessed that I'm a homosexual.

27:05.358 --> 27:08.958
My career is over. I'll be dismissed
at the next council session.

27:08.992 --> 27:10.872
That much, I don't contest.

27:10.992 --> 27:13.378
But I'm damned if I will confess to a crime

27:13.415 --> 27:16.131
when you have not a shred
of evidence to back it.

27:16.845 --> 27:19.040
If you think I've
interfered with this case,

27:19.049 --> 27:20.229
prove it!

27:20.349 --> 27:22.745
Interference in an ongoing
police investigation

27:22.745 --> 27:25.343
is not the crime for which you
are currently being investigated.

27:25.379 --> 27:27.868
Yes, of course, I've been brought
here on suspicion of murder.

27:27.904 --> 27:30.630
And which murder would
that be, Finch or Carleton?

27:30.658 --> 27:32.231
- At the moment, both!
- Ho!

27:32.351 --> 27:35.030
Well, you're ambitious,
I'll grant you that.

27:35.150 --> 27:37.116
And where's your evidence against me?

27:37.857 --> 27:39.027
This.

27:39.557 --> 27:42.192
Yes, I'll admit it, it does look damning.

27:42.658 --> 27:45.640
If Constable Finch had shown
that to Inspector Stockton,

27:45.685 --> 27:47.414
my career would have ended then.

27:47.534 --> 27:50.377
If it's motive you're
looking for, you've found it.

27:50.414 --> 27:52.947
But motive is not evidence.

27:52.957 --> 27:55.444
It is merely supposition.

27:56.002 --> 27:59.083
And... And tell me this.
If I did know about this,

27:59.120 --> 28:02.358
would I really have left it in
Finch's pocket for you to find?

28:02.577 --> 28:04.779
How did you know it
was found in his pocket?

28:04.814 --> 28:06.815
Well, where else would he
have kept it, under his hat?

28:07.736 --> 28:10.763
The truth is that I did not know
about this and therefore I did not

28:10.800 --> 28:13.251
have a motive for killing Constable Finch.

28:13.288 --> 28:14.459
And even if I did,

28:14.579 --> 28:16.572
I would not have killed him to save my job.

28:16.590 --> 28:18.565
Would you have killed
him to save your life?

28:18.685 --> 28:20.202
My life?

28:21.430 --> 28:24.832
Oh, yes, of course, you think
that I killed the Carleton boy.

28:24.866 --> 28:27.226
And do you have any evidence for that,

28:27.263 --> 28:29.183
or are you again reliant on your own

28:29.211 --> 28:32.105
- scurrilous suppositions?
- There was evidence:

28:32.140 --> 28:33.308
a bloody knife.

28:33.555 --> 28:36.426
Quite possibly, the murder weapon
was found at the scene of the crime.

28:36.454 --> 28:39.399
Unfortunately, it never
made it into evidence.

28:45.653 --> 28:47.155
Have a look at the evidence log.

28:47.164 --> 28:49.624
Compare the numbers to the dates.

28:50.017 --> 28:52.459
Well, this proves that
someone tampered with evidence.

28:52.468 --> 28:53.886
It doesn't prove that it was me.

28:53.895 --> 28:56.420
- Were you not in charge of the investigation?
- What of it?

28:56.540 --> 28:59.065
Any policeman could have
accessed these files.

28:59.099 --> 29:00.819
But not every policeman had cause.

29:00.856 --> 29:03.490
And what cause did I have?

29:03.865 --> 29:06.138
You lay with street boys!

29:06.619 --> 29:07.880
Never!

29:08.374 --> 29:09.481
Never!

29:09.865 --> 29:12.234
You're making a fundamental
error, Detective.

29:12.354 --> 29:16.533
You're conflating two perversions
which are very different.

29:17.969 --> 29:20.228
Do you seek the company of little girls?

29:20.246 --> 29:21.499
- Of course not.
- Well then,

29:21.499 --> 29:23.786
just because I'm a
homosexual, do not assume

29:23.813 --> 29:26.914
that I prey on boys. He

29:27.371 --> 29:31.511
- was a man.
- He was a prostitute, just like Joe Carleton.

29:31.524 --> 29:33.235
- They knew each other!
- Well, what of it?

29:33.262 --> 29:35.759
Why would I kill a street
boy that I didn't even know?

29:35.787 --> 29:36.628
You might,

29:36.656 --> 29:39.628
if you thought he was the
one who took this photograph.

29:39.994 --> 29:41.686
Oh, so that's your theory.

29:41.924 --> 29:45.235
Taking this photograph would have
required a flash of limelight.

29:45.592 --> 29:47.238
You cannot have been unaware of it.

29:47.274 --> 29:50.494
I can assure you that
I was not unaware of it.

29:52.049 --> 29:53.503
And I can also assure you

29:53.522 --> 29:55.543
that my response was
anything but murderous.

29:56.613 --> 29:58.989
What was your response?

30:00.345 --> 30:02.560
I was heartbroken.

30:03.619 --> 30:05.411
You see, Detective, Peter Reid

30:05.449 --> 30:08.238
was not a prostitute
whose services I was using.

30:09.235 --> 30:12.281
He was the man with whom I was infatuated.

30:13.314 --> 30:16.688
- But how did...
- Because I was a fool.

30:17.374 --> 30:20.811
He seduced me with his charm and wit...

30:22.459 --> 30:25.281
... and beauty.

30:26.393 --> 30:28.981
That's what made it so pathetic.

30:29.722 --> 30:31.533
I was blind.

30:32.310 --> 30:35.512
And when that flash went
off, my eyes were finally open

30:35.632 --> 30:38.822
to the fact of my own craven stupidity.

30:40.569 --> 30:43.606
- It was a trap?
- Of course it was a trap!

30:44.134 --> 30:45.938
And while you may think that

30:46.194 --> 30:48.627
I pursued the photographer
with vengeance in mind,

30:48.646 --> 30:50.539
the truth is that...

30:52.386 --> 30:53.977
... I wept.

30:55.615 --> 30:57.673
While the man I loved...

31:02.072 --> 31:03.892
While my lover

31:04.725 --> 31:06.828
got dressed and left.

31:09.957 --> 31:13.149
He was the last man I ever took to bed.

31:17.668 --> 31:20.668
I don't know why I'm telling you
all this. It's hardly relevant.

31:21.912 --> 31:24.282
So you never found out
who took the photograph?

31:24.300 --> 31:27.464
In hindsight it seems obvious.
Constable Finch took the photograph.

31:27.483 --> 31:30.327
- Yes, but you didn't know that.
- I did not.

31:30.346 --> 31:31.754
Then tell me this:

31:31.874 --> 31:34.214
why would you take that
shard of the negative?

31:34.250 --> 31:36.199
If you knew nothing of its contents,

31:36.226 --> 31:39.554
how did you know to enter the
bullpen and take the critical piece?

31:39.588 --> 31:41.990
I never said that I did.

31:44.144 --> 31:47.318
Is it then also your supposition
that Finch killed Joe Carleton?

31:47.318 --> 31:49.494
- Seems likely.
- Which would have given him reason

31:49.521 --> 31:52.247
to take the putative murder weapon
and to doctor the evidence log?

31:52.247 --> 31:56.336
- Adequate reason. how did
he do it after his death?

31:59.117 --> 32:01.092
You're familiar with the
science of graphology,

32:01.101 --> 32:02.830
- yes?
- Of course.

32:04.623 --> 32:06.187
This is a sample

32:06.232 --> 32:08.940
of Finch's handwriting.
Compare it to the evidence log.

32:09.283 --> 32:11.098
It's a given that they won't match.

32:11.556 --> 32:14.529
We've established that
Constable Finch was already dead.

32:14.556 --> 32:17.135
Oh, but they match much
better than one might think.

32:17.702 --> 32:20.510
Almost as if someone was deliberately

32:20.528 --> 32:22.404
trying to copy Finch's style.

32:22.524 --> 32:24.590
Who would think to be so precise?

32:25.566 --> 32:29.266
But copying someone's handwriting
style isn't that simple, is it?

32:29.477 --> 32:31.809
Reflexes are faster than the mind,

32:32.157 --> 32:35.010
habit overrules intent,
and we get careless.

32:35.760 --> 32:38.331
Have a look at the writing
at the bottom of the page.

32:38.451 --> 32:40.434
It's decidedly different.

32:41.441 --> 32:45.374
Much more like the
writing in this document.

32:46.562 --> 32:49.498
This is your writing from the same period.

32:53.367 --> 32:56.462
Is this the totality of your evidence?

32:56.496 --> 32:58.059
- So far.
- Then I suggest you

32:58.086 --> 32:59.861
lay your case before a judge and jury.

32:59.879 --> 33:01.910
All I would have to do is
show them this photograph.

33:01.955 --> 33:04.699
That's possibly true; in
which case, arrest me, try me,

33:04.736 --> 33:08.140
and hang me, but just
bloody well get it over with.

33:08.468 --> 33:11.916
if you knew nothing of
the photograph's contents,

33:11.944 --> 33:14.423
how did you know to
remove the critical piece?

33:14.441 --> 33:16.243
I've already given you an answer to that.

33:16.261 --> 33:18.557
You've given me nothing but prevarication!

33:18.677 --> 33:20.972
Oh, you haven't lied. You've just simply

33:20.990 --> 33:24.000
danced around the truth,
confessing all when it serves you,

33:24.018 --> 33:26.167
and shrinking into evasion when it doesn't!

33:26.186 --> 33:29.160
So it's the truth you want?

33:29.194 --> 33:32.075
Forgive me, I thought it was my conviction.

33:33.008 --> 33:36.218
We're neither of us stalwarts
when it comes to the truth,

33:36.246 --> 33:37.682
are we, Detective?

33:37.828 --> 33:40.133
- Meaning what?
- Meaning that there is a truth

33:40.280 --> 33:43.783
that lies between us that
you have yet to admit to.

33:44.807 --> 33:47.725
- You're referring to Constance Gardiner.
- A confessed murderer

33:47.734 --> 33:50.707
who somehow escaped from a locked cell.

33:54.411 --> 33:57.402
I know you set her free.

33:58.362 --> 34:00.890
And I know that you know.

34:04.088 --> 34:06.512
I'll make you a deal, Detective.

34:07.674 --> 34:10.467
My truth for yours.

34:11.313 --> 34:14.187
I'm afraid I can add nothing
further to the official account.

34:14.223 --> 34:15.568
That she escaped custody.

34:15.572 --> 34:17.821
Yes, I understand, you
share this particular lie

34:17.940 --> 34:20.076
with Inspector Brackenreid.

34:20.507 --> 34:23.146
If you go down, he goes down.

34:23.406 --> 34:26.214
Loyalty is the only moral instinct

34:26.242 --> 34:29.672
that can exist on the
same plane as truth itself.

34:30.353 --> 34:32.498
They may clash,

34:32.835 --> 34:36.559
but one can never overcome
the other without cost.

34:38.001 --> 34:40.635
But in this case, there's no cost to bear.

34:41.733 --> 34:44.960
The only official statement
made by Inspector Brackenreid

34:45.001 --> 34:48.309
was that he found the jail door unlocked.

34:48.344 --> 34:50.266
All true.

34:51.034 --> 34:53.266
So the door to the truth

34:53.275 --> 34:55.507
lies open before you.

34:55.661 --> 34:58.534
Murdoch! Come here.

35:05.101 --> 35:06.802
You're bloody mad.

35:06.922 --> 35:09.532
Sir, he's mixed up in all of
this and he's willing to tell us

35:09.537 --> 35:10.909
the truth about what happened.

35:10.937 --> 35:12.959
And what if the truth
is that he's innocent?

35:13.096 --> 35:15.903
- He's still Chief Constable. He'll fire ya!
- Sir...

35:15.949 --> 35:17.440
It's a trap, Murdoch.

35:17.760 --> 35:19.671
I need to do this.

35:34.680 --> 35:36.774
So, have you made a decision?

35:38.603 --> 35:41.311
- Truth for truth.
- Your truth first.

35:41.686 --> 35:43.442
Very well.

35:44.158 --> 35:46.927
Constance Gardiner was failed by the system

35:46.961 --> 35:48.701
that should have protected her.

35:49.150 --> 35:51.629
She killed a man that
viciously assaulted her,

35:51.656 --> 35:54.895
- along with countless other women...
- I don't see how this is germane.

35:55.169 --> 35:57.831
I acted on the dictates of my conscience.

35:58.705 --> 36:01.007
I let her go free.

36:03.035 --> 36:05.102
And there we have it!

36:05.312 --> 36:08.157
Hmm! I'm impressed.

36:08.715 --> 36:11.015
You must want the truth very badly.

36:12.941 --> 36:15.220
Well, a deal is a deal.

36:26.239 --> 36:28.928
- Did you take the shard of glass?
- Yes.

36:29.294 --> 36:31.672
How did you know to take it?

36:32.596 --> 36:34.671
I knew that Finch had taken the photograph.

36:34.690 --> 36:37.461
When I saw you begin to
examine the fractured negative,

36:37.488 --> 36:39.254
I knew what it would depict.

36:39.885 --> 36:41.486
Why did he take the photograph?

36:41.513 --> 36:44.623
Because it was Finch who
killed the Carleton boy.

36:44.641 --> 36:47.659
I knew it. He knew that I knew it.

36:47.925 --> 36:50.678
That's why he dropped
my knife at the scene.

36:51.155 --> 36:54.940
- Your knife? - Yes.
It was a clumsy set-up,

36:54.968 --> 36:57.461
laughably so. I was
intent on disproving it.

36:57.495 --> 36:58.937
But then came the photograph.

36:59.494 --> 37:01.470
Yes, and that changed everything.

37:02.265 --> 37:04.396
If I had pressed ahead with the case then,

37:04.442 --> 37:08.404
it would have been the word of a
homosexual deviant against that of a hero.

37:08.439 --> 37:10.573
- So you killed him.
- Yes.

37:10.607 --> 37:12.820
It wasn't intentional.

37:13.314 --> 37:15.957
He showed me the photograph,
I tried to wrest it from him,

37:15.994 --> 37:17.228
we fought...

37:17.348 --> 37:20.265
I grabbed the first thing I set
my hand on and hit him with it.

37:20.784 --> 37:22.752
Not even very hard.

37:23.146 --> 37:25.479
And you knew the cement
floor was about to be poured.

37:25.525 --> 37:26.951
A lucky coincidence.

37:26.961 --> 37:29.119
I dug beneath the gravel and buried him,

37:29.239 --> 37:32.375
and then set about disposing
of the knife that he'd dropped.

37:33.226 --> 37:36.427
- And changing the evidence log.
- Yes.

37:44.796 --> 37:46.763
Percival Giles,

37:47.238 --> 37:49.187
you are under arrest for murder.

38:01.577 --> 38:04.485
Oh, for God's sake, sit
down. He confessed everything.

38:04.513 --> 38:05.656
Exactly, Sir.

38:05.928 --> 38:06.955
Why?

38:07.075 --> 38:09.177
He could have simply
stopped talking at any point

38:09.177 --> 38:10.559
and taken his chance with a jury.

38:10.586 --> 38:12.424
- You had him dead to rights.
- I had nothing;

38:12.470 --> 38:14.455
nothing but scurrilous supposition.

38:14.657 --> 38:16.733
Your complaint is that it was too easy.

38:16.853 --> 38:18.242
It's not just that, Sir.

38:18.362 --> 38:20.199
How could he have taken the shard of glass?

38:20.236 --> 38:22.386
I was with him the entire time he was here.

38:22.404 --> 38:25.157
- You were called out by Dr. Grace.
- Right...

38:25.807 --> 38:28.194
George, Henry!

38:31.917 --> 38:35.556
Was Chief Constable Giles in the
bullpen at any point yesterday?

38:35.590 --> 38:37.166
No Sir.

38:37.286 --> 38:38.876
Not even when he left this office?

38:38.895 --> 38:41.309
No, Sir, he went straight down
this hall, out the front door.

38:42.233 --> 38:44.510
- Bloody hell.
- Right.

38:44.519 --> 38:47.107
I'll be wanting to speak with the
Chief Constable again, gentlemen.

38:47.227 --> 38:48.708
Sir.

38:53.639 --> 38:56.609
- You lied.
- I made a full confession.

38:56.644 --> 38:58.386
You made a false confession.

38:58.506 --> 39:01.112
I know you couldn't possibly
have stolen that shard of glass.

39:01.148 --> 39:03.124
I want to know who did and why.

39:03.161 --> 39:04.652
- Was it a lover?
- No!

39:04.679 --> 39:05.813
No...

39:06.060 --> 39:08.182
No. Lovers deceive.

39:09.444 --> 39:11.960
This is about something
more fundamental, isn't it?

39:12.755 --> 39:13.706
Loyalty.

39:14.923 --> 39:19.624
"The only moral force that can exist
on the same plane as the truth itself."

39:19.926 --> 39:22.688
But who could command such loyalty?

39:24.188 --> 39:25.322
Dodger.

39:26.154 --> 39:27.773
- Dodger?
- My dog.

39:27.807 --> 39:29.685
You have a dog named Dodger?

39:29.712 --> 39:31.880
This inquiry is in danger
of becoming repetitive.

39:31.898 --> 39:33.508
No, no, no, wait. Wait.

39:33.663 --> 39:38.181
There was someone else named Dodger...

39:38.852 --> 39:40.780
Constable Hodge.

39:41.209 --> 39:44.301
- You worked with Constable Hodge, didn't you?
- At one time...

39:44.338 --> 39:46.422
And that's why they called him Dodger,

39:46.425 --> 39:49.194
because he was your
loyal servant. It was him!

39:49.314 --> 39:51.636
- He stole the piece of glass.
- I don't know,

39:52.056 --> 39:53.520
and that is the truth of it.

39:53.520 --> 39:56.190
But how could he have known that
it was you in the photograph?

39:56.218 --> 39:59.099
How could he have known
unless he had... seen it?

40:02.108 --> 40:04.468
Oh, that's the truth of it, isn't it?

40:04.761 --> 40:06.810
It was Hodge.

40:06.930 --> 40:09.042
It was Hodge who saw the photograph,

40:09.162 --> 40:11.566
it was Hodge who tried
to wrest it from Finch,

40:11.686 --> 40:15.014
and it was Hodge who killed him, for you.

40:16.368 --> 40:18.352
Loyalty cuts both ways, doesn't it?

40:18.353 --> 40:20.164
I have said all I intend to say.

40:20.191 --> 40:22.258
Constable.

40:23.731 --> 40:26.384
Bring in Constable Hodge for me, please.

40:28.048 --> 40:30.491
You know he'll crumble
if I interrogate him.

40:30.518 --> 40:33.143
He'll trip over his words
like he always does and he will

40:33.153 --> 40:35.000
incriminate himself.

40:36.500 --> 40:39.381
It was an accident.

40:40.350 --> 40:42.856
He told me after the fact.

40:43.560 --> 40:47.784
We agreed to bury the body and the
evidence and never speak of it again.

40:49.414 --> 40:51.353
It must have destroyed your friendship.

40:51.390 --> 40:53.055
It destroyed our souls!

40:55.652 --> 40:57.948
You asked to see me?

40:59.668 --> 41:01.897
It's over, John.

41:01.932 --> 41:04.267
It's finally over.

41:04.301 --> 41:06.977
The detective knows everything.

41:10.755 --> 41:13.279
I am so sorry, Sir.

41:24.017 --> 41:27.273
I found Finch in the detective's office.

41:27.502 --> 41:30.109
He was putting a photograph in his desk.

41:30.931 --> 41:34.307
Did you know Detective
Giles was a homosexual?

41:34.700 --> 41:36.831
I thought he might be.

41:37.245 --> 41:40.079
I didn't know for sure until I saw it.

41:41.515 --> 41:43.188
Finch

41:43.828 --> 41:46.965
was going to blackmail Detective Giles.

41:47.085 --> 41:50.002
I could not let him do that.

41:52.646 --> 41:55.719
So you struck him with the iron mascot?

41:57.283 --> 42:00.438
I didn't mean to kill him, William.

42:00.967 --> 42:03.336
I swear, I just...

42:05.817 --> 42:08.442
I just wanted to stop him.

42:11.844 --> 42:14.287
Thank you very much,
Sir. I appreciate that.

42:14.314 --> 42:16.509
Good night.

42:18.083 --> 42:21.702
That was the Crown. Hodge
will be tried for manslaughter.

42:22.043 --> 42:25.116
Hopefully the new Chief
Constable will argue for leniency.

42:25.391 --> 42:26.415
And Giles?

42:26.433 --> 42:29.127
The best we could get for
him is obstruction of justice.

42:29.451 --> 42:30.951
Will he do jail time?

42:30.961 --> 42:33.101
He's an admitted homosexual
who buried a body,

42:33.147 --> 42:34.555
not to mention he's a copper.

42:34.583 --> 42:36.046
He'll probably do more time than Hodge.

42:36.092 --> 42:39.421
- That hardly seems fair.
- The law isn't about fairness, Murdoch.

42:39.695 --> 42:41.890
You should know that better than anybody.

42:42.641 --> 42:44.853
I wouldn't feel bad. You've
likely spared him the noose.

42:44.890 --> 42:47.414
- I doubt it would have come to that.
- Perhaps.

42:47.534 --> 42:50.030
You have to give the bugger
credit for his guts, though.

42:50.150 --> 42:52.499
Not many men would have fallen
on his sword for a friend.

42:52.619 --> 42:54.438
Actually, Sir, he seemed...

42:54.803 --> 42:57.758
relieved to get it off of his chest.

42:58.206 --> 43:00.023
Is that how you felt,

43:00.058 --> 43:02.159
confessing about Constance Gardiner?

43:03.072 --> 43:05.019
I suppose so, yes.

43:05.139 --> 43:06.745
I did break the law.

43:06.865 --> 43:09.062
You chose justice over the law.

43:09.309 --> 43:10.854
You did right, Murdoch.

43:11.055 --> 43:12.272
By her...

43:12.638 --> 43:15.153
and by me. Good night.

43:15.273 --> 43:17.341
Good night, Sir.

43:21.821 --> 43:23.174
All-new Murdoch.

43:23.215 --> 43:25.717
This current isn't enough to kill anyone.

43:28.764 --> 43:30.894
Oh, my!

43:33.080 --> 43:34.653
Murdoch Mysteries,

43:34.699 --> 43:36.885
