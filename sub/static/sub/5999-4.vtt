WEBVTT

00:01.752 --> 00:03.303
Dr. Oppenheimer has asked
me to run the new group.

00:04.174 --> 00:06.509
How soon can you deliver?
A month? A year?

00:07.069 --> 00:09.187
<i> Oppenheimer picked you because
he knows that he can control you.</i>

00:09.996 --> 00:13.281
You're the director of G group. Direct.

00:13.283 --> 00:16.283
I spent all day wondering why I
didn't make your idiotic group

00:16.286 --> 00:18.587
and you left me on the bench because
you can't control your hard-on?

00:18.621 --> 00:21.456
<i>Remind me of her name.</i>

00:21.458 --> 00:23.625
There was a time when I hoped Crosley

00:23.676 --> 00:27.345
would take a shine to my daughter.

00:27.380 --> 00:29.965
If you're not a communist,

00:29.967 --> 00:33.184
why are you risking your own
neck to give them a bomb?

00:33.219 --> 00:34.803
<i>You know, if Dr. Winter</i>

00:34.805 --> 00:36.805
<i>were in less than
comfortable circumstances,</i>

00:36.856 --> 00:40.308
I would worry they may not
improve after today's events.

00:40.359 --> 00:42.727
I can get you as far as
the Lamy train depot.

00:46.032 --> 00:46.982
<i>I had a dream you jumped up</i>

00:47.033 --> 00:48.984
<i>and licked my thighs.</i>

00:48.986 --> 00:51.119
<i>Robert Oppenheimer's
having an affair.</i>

00:51.153 --> 00:53.455
Abby, stay out of other
people's marriages.

00:53.489 --> 00:56.157
Your husband's not going
to Washington tomorrow.

00:56.159 --> 01:00.161
I do not need marital
advice from a deviant.

01:00.212 --> 01:02.380
You should have Oppenheimer's job.

01:09.085 --> 01:11.724
"Batter my heart, three-person'd God,

01:11.725 --> 01:14.695
for you as yet but
knock, breathe, shine

01:14.697 --> 01:16.864
and seek to mend.

01:16.915 --> 01:18.866
That I may rise and stand,

01:18.868 --> 01:20.918
overthrow me and bend your force

01:20.953 --> 01:23.538
to break, blow, burn

01:23.589 --> 01:25.540
and make me new."

01:30.629 --> 01:33.214
Batter my heart, o' two-person'd boy.

01:33.216 --> 01:35.516
For you as yet but cover your loins

01:35.550 --> 01:37.601
and abandon me.

01:37.636 --> 01:40.521
They expected me on the
Hill two days ago.

01:40.556 --> 01:41.973
No one's abandoning you.

01:44.226 --> 01:46.561
I'll die if you leave.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:57.739 --> 01:59.907
I'm gonna miss the 4:10.

01:59.908 --> 02:02.125
<i>Do you believe in reincarnation?</i>

02:02.160 --> 02:03.628
Dr. Inessa says you and I

02:03.662 --> 02:05.913
have been traveling
together for lifetimes.

02:05.915 --> 02:07.632
You told your psychiatrist about me.

02:07.666 --> 02:09.917
<i>I've been your daughter,
your brother, your wife.</i>

02:09.919 --> 02:11.919
<i>You gave birth to me
in a European ghetto.</i>

02:11.920 --> 02:14.137
You murdered me...

02:14.172 --> 02:16.007
dozens of times. You enjoyed it.

02:21.429 --> 02:23.430
What do you want from me?

02:24.433 --> 02:26.400
Same thing that you want.

02:26.435 --> 02:29.604
Hold me down under the water.

02:30.772 --> 02:33.107
Do it.

02:34.109 --> 02:36.277
<i>Do it.</i>

02:36.328 --> 02:38.145
<i>Do it!</i>

03:25.160 --> 03:26.544
What am I looking at?

03:26.578 --> 03:29.046
Request for a Declaration
of Taking Property 112,

03:29.081 --> 03:31.048
Ms. Maria Capo-Berryman,

03:31.083 --> 03:33.668
- Tract B-31 quadrant...
- English.

03:33.670 --> 03:35.886
We need to buy this lady's
farm so we can blow it up.

03:35.921 --> 03:37.505
The judge is a hard-ass.

03:37.507 --> 03:39.340
He wants to know why we're
trying to stiff her.

03:39.342 --> 03:40.641
I thought this went away.

03:40.676 --> 03:42.009
She claims the land is worth $750.

03:42.060 --> 03:44.228
The Army appraised it at $744.

03:44.262 --> 03:45.896
And the Army can't pony up six bucks?

03:45.931 --> 03:47.515
There are 43 of these. Today.

03:47.566 --> 03:49.984
- Tomorrow there could be...
- Jesus.

03:50.018 --> 03:51.973
Dr. Isaacs, I need an
ETA on the machine tools.

03:51.998 --> 03:53.154
Just, uh, take a number.

03:53.188 --> 03:55.323
Um, where are the
updated X-ray studies?

03:55.357 --> 03:57.358
- On your desk. And if I could...
- No calls.

04:05.868 --> 04:08.703
Jesus, Nancy, I said no calls!

04:11.256 --> 04:13.541
So... what do we tell the judge?

04:13.543 --> 04:16.177
Right. Tell him that I said

04:16.211 --> 04:18.546
that he can wipe his ass with
the Declaration of Taking.

04:18.596 --> 04:21.432
Tell him that this eminent
domain is imminent,

04:21.466 --> 04:23.684
- And tell Ms. Caperberry...
- Capo-Berryman...

04:23.719 --> 04:27.054
...to take her $744 or she
can take up her grievances

04:27.056 --> 04:29.056
with the business end
of a Sherman tank.

04:29.107 --> 04:30.608
We don't have time for this.

04:30.642 --> 04:32.276
God damn it! What?

04:32.310 --> 04:33.944
Blasphemy doesn't suit you.

04:33.979 --> 04:37.281
Uh, Dr. Oppenheimer, sir. Sorry.

04:37.315 --> 04:40.034
<i>You're too high up on the chart
for "sirs" and "sorries."</i>

04:40.068 --> 04:42.119
Yeah, well, uh, things have
been a little hectic here.

04:42.154 --> 04:44.121
I thought you'd be back on Tuesday.

04:44.156 --> 04:46.240
<i>There have been some unexpected delays.</i>

04:46.242 --> 04:47.908
We can't afford any more delays.

04:47.910 --> 04:50.077
We've missed the last three
interim delivery dates.

04:50.079 --> 04:52.413
That's why I need your hand
on the tiller, Charlie.

04:52.415 --> 04:54.749
- Sir, I think we need to...
- Split the governing board

04:54.751 --> 04:57.084
into administrative and
scientific divisions.

04:57.086 --> 04:59.220
<i>Cuts everyone's obligations by half,</i>

04:59.254 --> 05:01.222
<i>and it frees me to run
the technical staff.</i>

05:01.256 --> 05:02.973
Then do it.

05:03.008 --> 05:05.426
I... I don't...
I don't think

05:05.428 --> 05:06.927
it's my place to reconfigure the board.

05:06.929 --> 05:08.262
Only you have the authority.

05:08.264 --> 05:10.598
I'm granting you the
authority, Charlie.

05:10.649 --> 05:12.933
Assert it. Do whatever you must.

05:12.984 --> 05:16.020
If it helps to pretend
you're me, pretend.

05:17.022 --> 05:18.773
That's what I do.

05:38.894 --> 05:42.196
<i>First off, I'd like
to thank you all for being punctual</i>

05:42.231 --> 05:44.399
<i>on our first official
morning as the Gun Group.</i>

05:44.450 --> 05:46.367
<i>I'm sure many of you</i>

05:46.402 --> 05:49.070
<i>would rather be working on implosion.</i>

05:49.121 --> 05:51.456
<i>You may feel your talents
have been overlooked...</i>

05:51.490 --> 05:54.742
<i>like the younger sibling
living in implosion's shadow.</i>

05:57.663 --> 05:59.297
<i>But Charles Darwin was
a younger sibling</i>

05:59.331 --> 06:01.382
<i>and so was America.</i>

06:01.417 --> 06:05.470
<i>There's no question implosion
is a beautiful solution,</i>

06:05.504 --> 06:08.139
<i>but beauty does not win wars.</i>

06:08.139 --> 06:11.224
Wars are won by blunt force, brutality.

06:11.226 --> 06:15.612
Guns, not beauty, have won every war

06:15.647 --> 06:17.864
<i>since the Chinese
invented black powder.</i>

06:17.899 --> 06:19.866
Guns liberated this
country from the British,

06:19.901 --> 06:22.202
they liberated Europe
in the last world war.

06:22.236 --> 06:25.072
A gun also liberated
Reed Akley's brain.

06:26.324 --> 06:28.075
Thin Man was a gun-type weapon

06:28.126 --> 06:30.077
based on a thousand years
of ballistic science.

06:30.128 --> 06:31.912
You've got a barrel,
you've got a projectile.

06:31.963 --> 06:34.414
Now, we all know Thin Man failed...

06:34.416 --> 06:36.300
Is that what we're doing here?

06:36.334 --> 06:38.051
Resurrecting a cadaver?

06:38.086 --> 06:40.253
The problem with Thin
Man wasn't the gun.

06:40.305 --> 06:42.389
It was the bullet... plutonium.

06:42.423 --> 06:45.392
But if we swap plutonium for uranium,

06:45.426 --> 06:47.060
the gun design can work.

06:47.095 --> 06:50.597
And we are going to
make it work together.

06:51.683 --> 06:53.400
Thank you, Helga.

06:53.434 --> 06:56.069
Nothing quickens the pulse
at the start of a day's work

06:56.104 --> 06:58.572
like the sight of a lady with a pistol.

06:58.606 --> 07:01.074
Sadly, all the gumption
of American industry

07:01.109 --> 07:04.411
won't enrich enough uranium
to blow up a privy.

07:04.445 --> 07:06.496
<i>Not before 1950 at least.</i>

07:06.531 --> 07:09.583
We few, we unhappy few,

07:09.617 --> 07:12.252
have gathered here to wank out numbers

07:12.286 --> 07:15.122
until the implosion group
gets its ticker-tape parade.

07:15.124 --> 07:17.124
As head of the Gun
Group, I can assure you

07:17.175 --> 07:19.459
we will not be <i> wanking</i> anything.

07:19.461 --> 07:21.962
Ah. Head of the Gun Group, yes.

07:21.964 --> 07:23.630
One of those snappy claques

07:23.632 --> 07:27.017
that reports to the Chief
of the Projectile Division.

07:27.051 --> 07:30.687
Ah, there's his name, Dr.
William Hogarth.

07:32.140 --> 07:35.308
Who's for elevenses? Back in two hours?

07:57.665 --> 08:00.384
So...

08:00.418 --> 08:02.219
is this a case of the
clerical miscarriage

08:02.253 --> 08:03.837
or sadistic prank of the gods?

08:03.888 --> 08:06.006
Well, surely you didn't pick me.

08:06.008 --> 08:09.309
I wouldn't have picked you in the
full flower of your talents,

08:09.343 --> 08:12.229
much less this wilted state.

08:12.263 --> 08:13.847
Well, then, perhaps you'd
entertain a request

08:13.849 --> 08:16.233
for a favor for old times'.

08:16.267 --> 08:19.319
It's not in my power to
transfer you to the test group.

08:19.353 --> 08:21.238
Yeah, but you can sack me.

08:21.272 --> 08:24.858
Mm, off the project. Send
me packing for good.

08:26.444 --> 08:29.362
- For what cause?
- Truancy, insubordination.

08:29.364 --> 08:32.948
Whatever insults your daughter
suffered at my hands.

08:35.369 --> 08:37.003
Take your pick.

08:37.038 --> 08:38.371
<i>Attention...
SED Team three</i>

08:38.423 --> 08:40.874
<i>is in Building U, room 106.</i>

08:42.794 --> 08:46.379
When you come across a wounded buck,

08:46.381 --> 08:49.933
the sporting thing to do is shoot it.

08:49.967 --> 08:51.551
Please.

08:51.602 --> 08:54.721
You've never been on a
shoot, have you, Paul?

08:54.723 --> 08:58.942
At close range, the muzzle flash
ruins the flesh for eating.

08:58.976 --> 09:01.778
No, I think I'll savor this meal.

09:07.819 --> 09:10.454
The closest thing we have to
a medical reference at home

09:10.488 --> 09:13.373
is the Talmud.

09:13.407 --> 09:17.577
It's sort of like a Hebrew
"Farmer's Almanac."

09:20.331 --> 09:22.916
Apparently, there are five
different colors of female blood

09:22.967 --> 09:24.918
the rabbis consider to be unclean...

09:24.969 --> 09:28.305
red, black, bright crocus,

09:28.339 --> 09:31.424
earthy water, and diluted wine.

09:32.927 --> 09:34.761
Let's call it "earthy water."

09:34.763 --> 09:37.097
Is that bad?

09:37.099 --> 09:39.766
Well, I'm no rabbi, but I think the AMA

09:39.817 --> 09:43.820
would say it's an indication of
overly vigorous intercourse.

09:43.855 --> 09:47.324
<i>Maybe just ask Dr. Isaacs
to go easy for a few days.</i>

09:47.358 --> 09:48.608
Mm.

09:51.696 --> 09:53.446
<i>Nurse!</i>

09:53.498 --> 09:55.499
<i>Can I get some help in here, please?</i>

09:56.701 --> 09:58.118
Nurse?

10:04.125 --> 10:07.844
Kill the spider. Please kill it.

10:10.464 --> 10:13.133
Don't let it get away.
Just do it. Please.

10:13.184 --> 10:14.601
Oh, thank you.

10:25.897 --> 10:28.448
Joey was born on the fourth
floor of Beth Israel.

10:28.482 --> 10:30.150
Her mother would be horrified

10:30.201 --> 10:32.869
if she knew how her second
grandchild would be born.

10:32.904 --> 10:34.487
If my mother saw this
place, she'd find it

10:34.539 --> 10:36.206
the least horrifying thing about me.

10:38.876 --> 10:41.545
Oh.

10:43.247 --> 10:46.082
<i>The doctor says they're
not real contractions.</i>

10:47.752 --> 10:49.836
I told
him I'm not leaving

10:49.887 --> 10:52.005
until he takes this
thing out of my womb.

10:52.056 --> 10:54.507
Does Dr. Oppenheimer know you're here?

10:54.509 --> 10:56.843
I can put a call through to Washington.

10:56.845 --> 11:00.564
We both know that's a fool's errand.

11:01.766 --> 11:03.683
Well, at least let me get the nurse.

11:03.734 --> 11:06.353
<i>I don't need anyone to hold my hand.</i>

11:06.355 --> 11:08.154
I'm royalty.

11:08.189 --> 11:10.190
I've lived on relief checks.

11:10.192 --> 11:13.860
I've lost a husband to war and
others to lawyers. I've...

11:13.911 --> 11:15.946
<i>I've seen the elephant before.</i>

11:17.698 --> 11:22.252
They say the, uh... the
first baby is the hardest.

11:23.304 --> 11:25.288
Was your son difficult?

11:27.708 --> 11:29.876
Robert's leaving me.

11:45.610 --> 11:46.927
Charlie!

11:46.961 --> 11:49.396
Abby, what's wrong?

11:49.447 --> 11:51.448
- Is Joey okay?
- Yeah.

11:54.235 --> 11:56.453
The Oppenheimers are splitting up.

11:57.571 --> 11:58.939
- Abby?
- What?

11:58.973 --> 12:00.540
I told you to leave it alone.

12:00.574 --> 12:03.960
Today, of all days, I do
not have time for gossip.

12:03.995 --> 12:06.212
It's not gossip, it's intelligence.

12:06.247 --> 12:07.547
Kitty told me herself.

12:07.581 --> 12:09.299
What did she tell you, exactly?

12:09.333 --> 12:10.917
She said he's leaving
her for that woman

12:10.968 --> 12:12.919
in San Francisco, the Communist.

12:12.954 --> 12:14.921
He's with her right now.

12:17.425 --> 12:20.060
What, he told you he was
having lunch with Roosevelt?

12:20.094 --> 12:22.095
Charlie, this is your chance.

12:22.146 --> 12:25.432
For what?

12:25.434 --> 12:29.736
Well, it... it's not just
his family he's abandoning.

12:29.770 --> 12:31.321
He's leaving the project.

12:31.355 --> 12:33.273
No, Abby. You must've misunderstood.

12:33.324 --> 12:35.108
- Robert wouldn't do that.
- Don't do that.

12:35.110 --> 12:36.326
I understand perfectly.

12:36.360 --> 12:38.578
He's dropping the reins in your lap.

12:38.612 --> 12:40.613
The fate of the war, Charlie.

12:40.665 --> 12:42.499
You're already doing Oppenheimer's job.

12:42.533 --> 12:44.784
It's time you had the title.

12:50.875 --> 12:52.792
Nancy?

12:52.794 --> 12:55.462
I've reduced men three pay
grades for calling me less.

12:55.513 --> 12:57.597
Colonel.

12:57.631 --> 13:00.133
What can I do for you?

13:02.386 --> 13:04.220
What's that smell?

13:06.140 --> 13:08.141
Did you tell Judge Foster Clements

13:08.143 --> 13:12.645
to wipe his ass with the
Declaration of Taking forms?

13:12.647 --> 13:14.647
- Did he really?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

13:14.649 --> 13:16.700
<i>Could be his dog's,
could be his wife's.</i>

13:16.734 --> 13:20.820
The taxonomy of feces
is outside my purview.

13:22.490 --> 13:23.873
It was a poor choice of words.

13:25.543 --> 13:28.628
All due respect, Colonel,

13:28.662 --> 13:31.664
wrangling local judges...
it's not my purview.

13:31.666 --> 13:33.500
It's Dr. Oppenheimer's.

13:33.551 --> 13:35.001
Well, until one of you geniuses

13:35.052 --> 13:37.670
manages to bend the laws of space-time,

13:37.672 --> 13:40.974
he can't be here and in
Washington simultaneously.

13:41.008 --> 13:42.976
So you'll have to be his surrogate.

13:43.010 --> 13:45.178
Right. Washington.

13:45.229 --> 13:47.847
And he might be there a while.

13:47.849 --> 13:49.733
Operation Overlord is in motion.

13:49.767 --> 13:52.352
Overlord? It's happening now?

13:52.403 --> 13:54.904
Which is why we can't
abide snafus like this.

13:54.939 --> 13:56.239
Hitler's backed into a corner.

13:56.273 --> 13:57.690
He'll accelerate his project.

13:57.742 --> 13:59.692
We have to keep pace.

14:01.028 --> 14:03.530
We might need some reorganization.

14:04.698 --> 14:06.833
What exactly are you proposing?

14:06.867 --> 14:08.535
I think the Tech Area org chart

14:08.537 --> 14:12.872
might be outside of your
purview also, Colonel.

14:15.543 --> 14:18.461
Do you know why the general
chose Robert Oppenheimer?

14:19.797 --> 14:21.381
He dines with Cabinet members,

14:21.432 --> 14:24.517
smokes cigars with Cochiti Indians.

14:24.552 --> 14:26.352
Rides stallions with governors,

14:26.387 --> 14:28.888
takes target practice
with enlisted men.

14:28.890 --> 14:31.224
<i>Oppenheimer keeps the trains running</i>

14:31.275 --> 14:33.276
<i>with salesmanship and charm.</i>

14:33.310 --> 14:35.111
I haven't seen much of that lately.

14:35.146 --> 14:37.230
And without jeopardizing the project,

14:37.281 --> 14:39.532
by asking a judge to defecate

14:39.567 --> 14:44.287
on U.S. Code 40, subsection 3114.

14:44.321 --> 14:47.657
There isn't a physicist on God's
earth who could replace him.

15:04.642 --> 15:05.809
Winter.

15:08.929 --> 15:11.014
You have some pretty fancy friends.

15:14.485 --> 15:16.653
<i>Clean yourself up, for Chrissakes.</i>

15:49.136 --> 15:52.222
Martha. How... how did you...?

15:55.559 --> 15:57.026
Is it... is it...

15:57.061 --> 15:58.978
Is the war over?

16:00.814 --> 16:02.649
Yours is.

16:28.036 --> 16:30.421
President Roosevelt...

16:30.455 --> 16:32.923
ringing up the warden in
that tenth circle of hell.

16:32.957 --> 16:35.542
Wish those spooks had recorded that.

16:35.593 --> 16:38.378
It wasn't Franklin.

16:38.380 --> 16:40.380
You said Einstein
called the White House.

16:40.382 --> 16:42.883
It was Eleanor.

16:42.934 --> 16:45.385
She handles the lost causes.

16:51.643 --> 16:53.393
Frank, you need to slow down.

16:57.449 --> 16:59.233
I know.

17:01.736 --> 17:06.073
I tried to keep myself sane
remembering your hands.

17:06.075 --> 17:08.909
Every line...

17:08.911 --> 17:11.411
every pruning scar.

17:14.249 --> 17:16.916
I should've kept you and
Callie out of this.

17:18.920 --> 17:20.804
So the Princeton house is rented.

17:20.839 --> 17:22.756
But that Craftsman down the street

17:22.758 --> 17:24.558
is back on the market again.

17:24.592 --> 17:26.425
- I already talked to the realtor.
- Liza...

17:26.428 --> 17:29.596
And then we can visit your
father on the way home.

17:29.598 --> 17:31.431
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

17:33.985 --> 17:36.186
You don't have to apologize.

17:38.022 --> 17:40.357
I have to go back to the Hill.

17:43.444 --> 17:45.245
You just escaped from a prison.

17:45.280 --> 17:47.531
You... you want to break back into one?

17:49.284 --> 17:50.834
We're never going back to that place.

17:50.869 --> 17:54.171
No... no, I...

17:54.205 --> 17:55.956
I don't expect you to come with me.

17:55.958 --> 17:57.674
<i>...known details.</i>

17:57.709 --> 18:01.261
<i>All figures to follow are
best known estimates.</i>

18:01.296 --> 18:03.347
<i>There is a new front
in the war in Europe.</i>

18:03.381 --> 18:08.936
<i>156,000 Allied soldiers have
landed in northern France.</i>

18:08.970 --> 18:12.139
<i>The invasion is still
in its earliest hours,</i>

18:12.190 --> 18:14.474
<i>But all indications point
to a promising start</i>

18:14.526 --> 18:17.644
<i>along the approximately 60-mile front.</i>

18:17.695 --> 18:20.364
<i>Casualties have been
lighter than expected</i>

18:20.398 --> 18:22.533
<i>with no signs of
immediate retaliation...</i>

18:22.567 --> 18:24.368
I've got a half brother out
there slaughtering Heinies.

18:24.402 --> 18:26.320
I'm sitting here like a woman.

18:26.371 --> 18:28.789
Don't flatter yourself.

18:28.823 --> 18:30.958
Turn it off.

18:30.992 --> 18:33.994
<i>- The show must go on.</i>
- For how long?

18:34.045 --> 18:35.963
We're... we're taking Europe.
Isn't class dismissed?

18:35.997 --> 18:40.167
Not until the last Jap is eating
apple pie with his chopsticks.

18:40.218 --> 18:43.220
I've been asked to send
a liaison to Site X

18:43.254 --> 18:46.340
to oversee the enrichment
of their marvelous uranium.

18:46.391 --> 18:47.841
I spent three years at Site X.

18:47.892 --> 18:50.344
I know the staff. I'd be glad to go.

18:50.395 --> 18:52.846
As head of the Gun Group, it
should be my responsibility.

18:52.848 --> 18:55.682
Nothing so poignant as idle ambition.

18:55.733 --> 18:58.569
But if you two insist on a duel...

18:58.603 --> 19:00.854
I meant to weigh in on
the relative merits

19:00.905 --> 19:04.157
of three equally deficient
refinement techniques.

19:04.192 --> 19:09.496
Best proposal buys you a ticket
on the Chattanooga Choo Choo.

19:09.530 --> 19:12.032
Why would you want to leave the Hill?
You just got here.

19:12.034 --> 19:14.368
Did take a bit longer than I'd hoped.

19:14.370 --> 19:16.203
But if the war is almost over,

19:16.205 --> 19:19.790
I can't pass up a chance for a
final promotion now, can I?

19:25.213 --> 19:28.348
<i>Hitler will dig
in, probably for months.</i>

19:28.383 --> 19:30.601
And every day he does, the
Army pumps Oppenheimer

19:30.635 --> 19:33.053
or Isaacs, the whole senior
staff, full of their lies.

19:33.055 --> 19:35.555
"Imminent Threats," V2 over New York,

19:35.557 --> 19:37.691
cities of ruins.

19:37.725 --> 19:39.610
They'll say anything to
build that thing faster.

19:39.644 --> 19:41.561
Racing an imaginary German project.

19:41.563 --> 19:44.031
Yeah. Trust me,

19:44.065 --> 19:48.402
all I want is to come
with you to Princeton.

19:48.404 --> 19:51.738
But you're the only
man who can fix this.

19:51.789 --> 19:53.707
Have you ever wondered why

19:53.741 --> 19:56.243
you're always the only man for the job?

19:56.294 --> 19:58.629
It's just a few days.
That's all I need.

19:58.663 --> 20:00.914
There are hundreds and
thousands of soldiers

20:00.916 --> 20:02.549
hurling themselves up those beaches,

20:02.583 --> 20:04.468
but Frank Winter thinks
he's the only man

20:04.502 --> 20:07.254
who can save the world <i> alone.</i>

20:07.305 --> 20:09.473
<i>You know Glen warned me about this.</i>

20:09.507 --> 20:12.092
<i>In 1939, you thought
you were the only man</i>

20:12.143 --> 20:13.593
who could set this ball rolling.

20:13.595 --> 20:15.262
Now in 1944, you're the only one

20:15.264 --> 20:16.730
who can stand in its way.

20:16.764 --> 20:19.599
This time it's different.

20:19.601 --> 20:22.436
You know, I'm not gonna chauffeur
you back up that hill.

20:22.438 --> 20:24.655
You want it so bad, you can hitchhike.

20:24.689 --> 20:25.989
<i>I apologize.</i>

20:26.024 --> 20:27.658
Big doin's today.

20:27.692 --> 20:30.994
Y'all finished or you
want something more?

20:33.281 --> 20:35.332
That, uh...

20:35.366 --> 20:37.918
that Model A you got out there.

20:37.952 --> 20:40.287
It says there's a contest.

20:40.338 --> 20:42.255
Will it get me as far as New Mexico?

20:42.290 --> 20:43.790
Jesus, Frank.

20:43.841 --> 20:45.792
All you gotta do to win it
is beat Red's own record

20:45.843 --> 20:47.294
for eating Texas red chili.

20:47.345 --> 20:49.763
But I should warn you...
no one's ever done it,

20:49.797 --> 20:51.682
and the chili's two bucks if you lose.

20:51.716 --> 20:55.268
Well, since yesterday I
was starving to death.

20:55.303 --> 20:56.470
I kinda like my chances.

20:56.521 --> 20:57.971
All right.

20:58.022 --> 21:00.857
Papa, Sonny, bucket of Texas Red.

21:00.892 --> 21:02.392
Comin' right up, Mama.

21:07.398 --> 21:09.950
You had no right to
keep a secret that big.

21:09.984 --> 21:11.618
I had no choice.

21:11.652 --> 21:13.286
<i>Because you took an oath?</i>

21:13.321 --> 21:16.323
You broke every rule in the
Army handbook except one.

21:16.374 --> 21:18.825
What does that make me? The
exception that proves the rule?

21:37.512 --> 21:38.895
Is Red human?

21:38.930 --> 21:42.349
No, sir. That's him right there...

21:42.400 --> 21:48.355
<i>a Berkshire hog.</i>

21:48.357 --> 21:51.575
<i>Here are the latest
details as we now grasp them.</i>

21:51.609 --> 21:54.911
<i>While landing along the beaches
of France continue even now,</i>

21:54.946 --> 21:57.414
<i>dodging enemy fire along the shore,</i>

21:57.448 --> 22:00.033
<i>Prime Minister Churchill
informed the House of Commons...</i>

22:00.084 --> 22:02.335
Lady of Norfolk had a
baby this morning.

22:02.370 --> 22:03.870
Called her "Dee Day."

22:03.921 --> 22:06.873
Spelled D-e-e Day.

22:08.092 --> 22:09.543
Ain't that cute?

22:11.129 --> 22:14.097
Naming your daughter after a land war?

22:14.132 --> 22:20.125
It's adorable.

22:26.283 --> 22:29.702
You're not as chatty
as the last mail girl.

22:50.975 --> 22:52.308
How did you get in here?

22:52.359 --> 22:54.360
Spycraft.

22:54.395 --> 22:56.362
I told the janitor I was your cousin.

22:56.397 --> 22:58.031
I have one aunt.

22:58.065 --> 22:59.866
I'm pretty sure she's a virgin.

22:59.900 --> 23:01.701
<i>You've been listening to the news?</i>

23:01.736 --> 23:03.369
I have bigger news.

23:03.404 --> 23:05.238
For us, anyway.

23:08.994 --> 23:11.495
Charlie Isaacs is gunning
for Oppenheimer's job.

23:11.520 --> 23:12.328
<i>What?</i>

23:12.330 --> 23:13.880
Yeah, Frank was just the warm-up act.

23:13.914 --> 23:16.049
Now he's got Oppie in his crosshairs.

23:16.083 --> 23:18.001
You remember what
happened to Julius Caesar

23:18.052 --> 23:19.335
on the Ides of March?

23:19.386 --> 23:22.088
No, I only read the first 10 pages.

23:24.341 --> 23:26.843
Charlie thinks that he can
win the war by himself.

23:26.845 --> 23:29.512
He pulled me and Fritz in
to make his case for him.

23:31.265 --> 23:34.734
Well... then make it.

23:34.769 --> 23:36.186
What?

23:36.237 --> 23:38.321
This is good for us.

23:38.355 --> 23:40.406
If Charlie Isaacs
overthrows Oppenheimer,

23:40.441 --> 23:42.358
it sets the schedule back, right?

23:42.409 --> 23:44.410
- I guess so.
- The longer that it takes anyone

23:44.445 --> 23:46.579
to deliver a weapon, the
less chance anyone has

23:46.614 --> 23:49.916
of dropping it over a city ful
k before the war is over.

23:49.950 --> 23:52.752
You wanna save lives, right?

23:56.924 --> 23:58.541
So talk Charlie into it.

24:02.379 --> 24:04.430
Uh, you are not Gretchen.

24:04.465 --> 24:05.882
Two doors down.

24:05.933 --> 24:07.767
Sorry.

24:11.305 --> 24:14.057
We have to set some ground rules.

24:14.059 --> 24:15.775
We can't be seen like this.

24:15.810 --> 24:17.393
Well... so, what?

24:17.444 --> 24:20.029
We just pass notes in the hall?

24:20.064 --> 24:22.198
Like grade school?

24:22.233 --> 24:23.950
We have to limit our contact.

24:23.984 --> 24:26.953
If... if anyone asks, we, um...

24:26.987 --> 24:28.738
we had a one-night stand.

24:28.789 --> 24:31.241
It was a bad match.

24:31.292 --> 24:33.293
Hmm.

24:35.412 --> 24:38.081
Though since we are...

24:38.083 --> 24:40.884
bending the rules.

24:40.918 --> 24:44.754
This could be our last
hurrah for a while.

24:44.805 --> 24:47.924
- Stop.
- Why?

24:47.926 --> 24:49.475
Because we're cousins?

24:51.096 --> 24:53.596
Don't be an altar boy, Jim.

24:53.598 --> 24:58.601
I am the only one on the Hill
that knows what you really are.

24:58.652 --> 25:01.154
And you're the only one
who knows what I am.

25:02.273 --> 25:03.990
And if I wasn't?

25:06.443 --> 25:07.944
Does it really matter?

25:30.134 --> 25:32.302
They're not gonna let
you back on the Hill.

25:32.353 --> 25:34.804
You think it was hard getting out?

25:34.806 --> 25:36.556
I have to try.

25:54.825 --> 25:57.493
I'll take you to the
bottom of the Hill.

25:57.495 --> 25:59.495
But I go no further.

25:59.497 --> 26:01.798
There's no question our
efficiency takes a nosedive

26:01.832 --> 26:03.633
when Oppenheimer is off campus.

26:03.667 --> 26:08.054
89% of targets met to
81% when he's away.

26:08.088 --> 26:11.174
But if, God forbid,
we lost him entirely,

26:11.176 --> 26:13.059
we'd hit zero. Zilch.

26:13.093 --> 26:15.345
<i>Oppenheimer is the reason
we have Triple A priority.</i>

26:15.396 --> 26:17.313
You think we'd slip to AA-1?

26:17.348 --> 26:21.517
AA-2. We wouldn't have the
metals or the machine tools

26:21.519 --> 26:24.821
<i>that we'd need to build
a prototype until 1946.</i>

26:24.855 --> 26:27.824
<i>If we have any chance of hitting
our targets, we need Oppie.</i>

26:27.858 --> 26:29.692
<i>We need him on the Hill full-time.</i>

26:29.694 --> 26:32.528
And never mind what happens
if the Germans accelerate.

26:32.579 --> 26:35.365
Yeah, but that's not
accounting for Stan Musial.

26:35.416 --> 26:36.866
<i>Do you remember, uh,</i>

26:36.868 --> 26:39.535
remember last year when the Cardinals

26:39.537 --> 26:41.337
lost Enos Slaughter to the service?

26:41.372 --> 26:43.206
Yeah, of course. I'm from St. Louis.

26:43.208 --> 26:44.540
<i>Right. Everybody thought
you guys were cooked.</i>

26:44.542 --> 26:47.043
But you put Musial in right field

26:47.045 --> 26:49.879
and you won the pennant by 18 games.

26:49.881 --> 26:53.049
Now, we're all assuming that no
one can replace Oppenheimer,

26:53.100 --> 26:56.886
but what if we had a Musial,

26:56.937 --> 26:59.889
<i>someone equal to Oppenheimer or better?</i>

26:59.891 --> 27:02.225
<i>For all we know, we could
be testing by March.</i>

27:02.276 --> 27:04.227
<i>But the Cards
still lost the series.</i>

27:04.229 --> 27:06.229
By moving Musial to right,

27:06.280 --> 27:08.231
they had no one to replace him in left.

27:08.282 --> 27:10.733
I mean, maybe if Frank was still
here, you would have a case,

27:10.735 --> 27:13.486
- <i>but otherwise...</i>
- This stays between us.

27:20.244 --> 27:22.245
I need to speak with Dr.
Oppenheimer now.

27:22.247 --> 27:23.579
Can you get him on the phone, please?

27:23.581 --> 27:25.748
No. But I can get you a map.

27:38.312 --> 27:40.596
Why didn't you tell me you were back?

27:43.600 --> 27:45.268
Is Kitty asking for me?

27:45.319 --> 27:48.271
<i>Everyone's</i> asking for you.

27:48.322 --> 27:51.407
The two divisions insist on meeting
with you before they split,

27:51.442 --> 27:53.609
and the Munitions Board won't
raise urgency standings

27:53.660 --> 27:55.078
without your sign-off.

27:55.112 --> 27:57.447
Also, apparently, I pissed off

27:57.498 --> 28:00.283
Judge Clements of Santa Fe County.

28:00.285 --> 28:02.618
Clements. You should
invite him to my stable.

28:02.620 --> 28:05.455
He loves gelding horses.

28:05.457 --> 28:07.457
I don't mean horses
that have been gelded.

28:07.459 --> 28:10.793
He loves the specific
act of gelding a horse.

28:10.844 --> 28:13.296
Jesus. Do you hear yourself?

28:13.347 --> 28:15.848
It's one thing to play
the oriental sage,

28:15.883 --> 28:18.768
it's another to smoke the opium.

28:18.802 --> 28:21.137
Do we have a problem, Dr. Isaacs?

28:22.723 --> 28:24.941
You were here nine days in all of May.

28:24.975 --> 28:26.359
None in June.

28:26.393 --> 28:30.113
I can't do my job when I'm doing yours.

28:30.147 --> 28:31.781
Don't you want my job?

28:31.815 --> 28:34.117
That's what everyone
thinks, including my wife,

28:34.151 --> 28:35.368
but they're wrong.

28:35.402 --> 28:38.154
I-I want you to want your job.

28:44.912 --> 28:47.463
This is where it will happen...

28:47.498 --> 28:49.499
your test.

28:49.550 --> 28:53.002
Where the caldera opens up
and swallows the world.

28:53.053 --> 28:55.755
It's your test, Robert.

29:00.727 --> 29:03.346
So, that's it. You're,
uh, really walking away?

29:03.397 --> 29:06.899
I'll be alerting General Groves
that you are my successor.

29:06.934 --> 29:09.569
No, I don't accept.

29:10.687 --> 29:11.938
It's D-day.

29:13.407 --> 29:16.359
75,000 American soldiers

29:16.361 --> 29:18.027
are throwing themselves
into enemy fire,

29:18.029 --> 29:19.862
and you're abandoning ship.

29:19.913 --> 29:22.365
You think Overlord wouldn't have
happened without Eisenhower?

29:22.416 --> 29:24.367
You're wrong.

29:24.369 --> 29:26.369
"Great men"?

29:26.420 --> 29:27.837
Pasteboard masks.

29:27.871 --> 29:30.756
I know you were in San Francisco.

29:30.791 --> 29:32.542
Take a mistress. What do I care?

29:32.544 --> 29:35.044
Take a whole harem if it
gets you through the day.

29:35.046 --> 29:37.046
But you have got to
get through the day.

29:37.048 --> 29:38.931
Oh, to finish the gadget?

29:38.966 --> 29:40.766
So that we win the war?

29:40.801 --> 29:44.187
Then lord it over our allies in peace.

29:44.221 --> 29:47.056
Wave it under Stalin's
nose if he gets rowdy.

29:47.107 --> 29:49.725
That sounds pretty Red.

29:49.727 --> 29:52.778
- Careful, Charlie.
- This woman, whoever she is,

29:52.813 --> 29:54.780
she's a Communist, isn't she?

29:54.815 --> 29:56.816
She's planting ideas in your head.

29:59.453 --> 30:01.237
Her name is Jean.

30:04.324 --> 30:06.909
Look, I haven't been perfect, either.

30:06.960 --> 30:09.579
I was with another woman,
I cared about her,

30:09.630 --> 30:11.831
but... but I have a family.

30:13.967 --> 30:16.969
- So you ended it.
- Yes, I ended it.

30:19.423 --> 30:22.425
If that was in your power,

30:22.427 --> 30:25.478
then you have no early idea how I feel.

30:34.271 --> 30:35.771
<i>Already
throughout the nation,</i>

30:35.822 --> 30:37.607
<i>countless church
services are being held.</i>

30:37.609 --> 30:39.158
<i>Many states and cities</i>

30:39.193 --> 30:41.611
<i>have issued special
proclamations on D-Day.</i>

30:41.613 --> 30:43.779
<i>Britain's King George is
scheduled to go on the air</i>

30:43.830 --> 30:45.248
<i>this afternoon at 3:00</i>

30:45.282 --> 30:46.949
<i>for the special "Invasion Day" message.</i>

30:51.622 --> 30:55.591
What do you think of Winnifred?
"Win" for short.

30:55.626 --> 30:58.628
<i>A triumphant name for a postwar baby.</i>

30:58.630 --> 31:01.464
<i>It was Joey's idea.
Like "Winnie the Pooh."</i>

31:05.352 --> 31:08.020
- <i>You had a long day.</i>
- I was with Robert.

31:08.055 --> 31:10.856
He's back. What did he say?

31:10.891 --> 31:13.643
You were right.

31:13.645 --> 31:15.561
He wants me to take over.

31:16.897 --> 31:18.314
I knew it.

31:18.365 --> 31:20.199
Charlie, I'm so proud of you.

31:20.234 --> 31:21.817
Abby, there's nothing to celebrate.

31:21.868 --> 31:23.319
You are worse than my father.

31:23.370 --> 31:25.037
If it were up to him,
he'd be selling hats

31:25.072 --> 31:27.323
out of the back of a truck on Route 60.

31:27.325 --> 31:30.660
But, luckily, my mother had a
little more faith in his product.

31:30.711 --> 31:33.462
For the millionth time...

31:33.497 --> 31:35.331
I'm not a businessman.

31:35.382 --> 31:38.167
Well, no, but you have the
best products on the market...

31:38.218 --> 31:40.636
- your brain.
- For Christ's sake, my brain

31:40.671 --> 31:43.673
can't requisition B-29 bombers, Abby.

31:43.724 --> 31:46.225
Or keep Senator Truman and his cronies

31:46.260 --> 31:48.678
from shutting off the money tap.

31:48.680 --> 31:50.513
Only Oppenheimer can do that.

31:50.564 --> 31:52.815
Well, if Robert thinks that
you can steer the project...

31:52.849 --> 31:55.184
I don't think he cares
if I steer the project

31:55.186 --> 31:57.069
right into the Rio Grande.

31:58.438 --> 32:00.439
<i>This is bad, Abby.</i>

32:02.526 --> 32:04.860
- Okay.
- <i>Without Oppenheimer,</i>

32:04.862 --> 32:07.863
his connections, the game's over.

32:10.417 --> 32:12.752
Well... well, then we
have to change his mind.

32:13.870 --> 32:16.205
<i>We</i> can't do anything.

32:16.207 --> 32:18.374
You think we're some kind of a team

32:18.425 --> 32:21.344
just 'cause you know about the gadget?

32:21.378 --> 32:24.046
<i>I just spent the last hour
in the middle of nowhere</i>

32:24.097 --> 32:27.717
<i>wasting my breath trying to
convince the man to stay.</i>

32:27.719 --> 32:29.719
Well...

32:31.271 --> 32:33.522
Maybe you're wasting your breath

32:33.557 --> 32:35.141
on the wrong person.

32:37.110 --> 32:40.112
If that's true, someone
has to do something.

32:54.484 --> 32:56.702
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

32:56.736 --> 32:57.763
<i>Today's Allied casualty list.</i>

33:00.172 --> 33:02.739
The thought of all those boys
cut down in their prime.

33:02.773 --> 33:07.010
You know, Clark Gable enlisted
after his wife's plane crashed.

33:07.061 --> 33:09.179
Yes.

33:09.181 --> 33:12.515
Uh, he... he was very
good in "Boom Town."

34:07.323 --> 34:09.290
Hello?

34:09.324 --> 34:10.875
Hello.

34:10.909 --> 34:12.659
Am I speaking with the
lady of the house?

34:12.661 --> 34:16.797
This is, uh, Doris Lombard
with "Redbook Magazine."

34:16.831 --> 34:18.299
<i>Well, I'm the only one here.</i>

34:18.333 --> 34:20.717
<i>I suppose that makes me the lady.</i>

34:20.753 --> 34:22.719
Unmarried. Perfect.

34:22.755 --> 34:24.339
We are conducting a survey

34:24.341 --> 34:27.175
what the modern girl
looks for in a man.

34:27.226 --> 34:29.893
May I have your name and initial?

34:31.013 --> 34:33.731
My name is Jean. Initial "T."

34:35.234 --> 34:37.735
What a sensible name.

34:37.770 --> 34:39.853
Now, do you have a gentleman,

34:39.905 --> 34:42.523
or do you prefer to play the field?

34:44.025 --> 34:45.693
<i>There's no field,</i>

34:45.744 --> 34:49.330
<i>just 3,000 miles between
conjugal visits.</i>

34:49.364 --> 34:51.199
Sounds like a strain.

34:52.418 --> 34:54.202
How do you keep the fireplace stoked

34:54.253 --> 34:56.371
with this... gentleman?

34:56.373 --> 34:58.206
<i>We talk on the telephone.</i>

34:58.208 --> 35:01.092
Sometimes we swallow each other whole.

35:01.126 --> 35:05.463
<i>Don't you ever worry he
might be stepping out on you?</i>

35:06.932 --> 35:09.684
<i>I know he is with his wife.</i>

35:09.718 --> 35:12.887
<i>Oh, a married man. That's risky.</i>

35:12.889 --> 35:14.389
You're hovering.

35:15.557 --> 35:16.641
Thank you.

35:23.065 --> 35:25.733
I'm so sorry to come by
at a time like this.

35:25.784 --> 35:27.735
It's about Robert.

35:27.786 --> 35:29.237
I'm four centimeters dilated

35:29.288 --> 35:30.788
and he's packing his steamer trunks.

35:30.823 --> 35:32.206
What else do you want to know?

35:32.241 --> 35:33.908
Please. I need you to reason with him.

35:33.910 --> 35:37.128
He won't listen to me.

35:37.162 --> 35:40.581
He tried to murder a man once.

35:40.583 --> 35:42.550
Did you know that?

35:42.584 --> 35:43.918
His physics tutor at Cambridge.

35:43.969 --> 35:46.587
He was upset over a paper,

35:46.638 --> 35:50.591
so he dipped an apple in cyanide
and left it on the man's desk.

35:50.642 --> 35:51.809
Like Snow White.

35:51.844 --> 35:53.761
- That's...
- Certifiable?

35:53.812 --> 35:56.647
She makes him look like the
model of mental health.

35:56.682 --> 35:58.266
Jean is out of her mind

35:58.268 --> 35:59.817
and that's why he can't resist her.

35:59.852 --> 36:03.604
You want me to reason with him?

36:03.606 --> 36:06.274
For five years I have been
my husband's straightjacket,

36:06.276 --> 36:08.359
and he's finally slipped out of it.

36:09.945 --> 36:11.946
<i>What about your reputation?</i>

36:11.997 --> 36:14.499
<i>Don't you worry about what
might happen if word got out?</i>

36:14.533 --> 36:16.451
I try not to associate
with the kind of people

36:16.453 --> 36:17.952
who value reputations.

36:18.003 --> 36:21.956
Well, what about your gentleman friend?

36:22.007 --> 36:26.961
Don't you think the affair
might affect his career?

36:30.215 --> 36:32.633
<i>This isn't a survey, is it?</i>

36:38.140 --> 36:39.724
I know what you are.

36:41.143 --> 36:44.529
Seducing him with pornographic sonnets

36:44.563 --> 36:46.481
and Freudian nonsense.

36:47.483 --> 36:50.284
<i>Who is this?</i>

36:50.319 --> 36:51.786
He's about to have another child,

36:51.820 --> 36:55.239
and you want to rip him
away from his family.

36:57.159 --> 37:00.127
What do you mean "another child"?

37:00.162 --> 37:04.131
Oh. Of course he didn't tell you.

37:04.166 --> 37:05.550
I mean, he lies to his wife,

37:05.584 --> 37:07.385
why shouldn't he lie to you?

37:11.840 --> 37:13.591
<i>Is this Kitty?</i>

37:16.895 --> 37:18.679
He doesn't love you.

37:20.849 --> 37:22.517
You're just a rag.

37:22.568 --> 37:24.151
You are nothing.

37:24.186 --> 37:27.188
And you will <i> never</i> see
my husband again.

37:42.037 --> 37:44.755
They just opened the doors
and let him walk out.

37:44.790 --> 37:47.208
Well, it's okay. I
know where he's going.

37:47.210 --> 37:49.460
I'll call you back.

37:53.298 --> 37:55.516
Dr. Oppenheimer is leaving his wife

37:55.551 --> 37:58.436
for a Communist in San Francisco.

37:58.470 --> 38:00.471
Jean Tatlock.

38:01.640 --> 38:03.641
You knew.

38:06.395 --> 38:09.897
Did you know that he's
abandoning the project for her?

38:09.948 --> 38:12.617
Tendering his resignation,
effective immediately.

38:12.651 --> 38:14.702
Cost to the schedule if he leaves.

38:14.736 --> 38:17.038
Three months lost at least.

38:17.072 --> 38:21.075
Assuming the Magpie intelligence
is right, that's the ball game.

38:21.126 --> 38:23.294
By next summer Washington,
D.C.'s a crater,

38:23.328 --> 38:27.331
and, uh, Heisenberg's on the
cover of "Time" magazine.

38:34.473 --> 38:36.173
We have to do something.

38:37.809 --> 38:39.260
We?

38:39.262 --> 38:41.262
<i>Well, you said no one can replace him.</i>

38:41.264 --> 38:42.813
Or conscript him.

38:42.848 --> 38:46.100
He works on the project voluntarily.

38:46.151 --> 38:49.487
His wife says the woman is sick.

38:49.521 --> 38:52.239
The state of California must have
ordinances for that sort of thing.

38:52.274 --> 38:54.609
Couldn't you lock her
up for her own safety?

38:54.611 --> 38:57.445
Oppenheimer is a master of bureaucracy.

38:57.496 --> 38:59.330
He'd simply wave a magic pen.

38:59.364 --> 39:02.450
Right. I... I'm not telling
you how to do your job.

39:02.501 --> 39:05.453
I'm just telling you that
there's a job to be done.

39:07.956 --> 39:11.959
Frank Winter was a problem.
We made him disappear.

39:21.675 --> 39:24.927
Liquid diffusion can enrich
the feedstock for K-25.

39:24.978 --> 39:26.479
As you can see, Dr. Hogarth,

39:26.513 --> 39:28.664
it's our best chance
at rapid enrichment.

39:28.698 --> 39:30.599
Yeah, that's just a stopgap.

39:30.650 --> 39:33.269
Um, my proposal is to skip Alpha stage

39:33.320 --> 39:35.771
and move directly to the
Beta track of the calutron.

39:38.275 --> 39:41.444
Still a long way from
overcoming the uranium problem.

39:41.446 --> 39:45.831
But it's competent work from
the groundlings in the pit.

39:45.866 --> 39:48.784
I think you'll see if you examine
my detailed calculations...

39:48.835 --> 39:52.621
Very tedious all this is.
I have no doubt.

39:52.623 --> 39:56.625
But I was intrigued by a third proposal

39:56.676 --> 39:58.377
that came across my desk.

39:59.963 --> 40:03.632
Yeah. Apologies. I'll,
um, happily return those

40:03.634 --> 40:05.601
to their proper owner.

40:05.635 --> 40:07.636
I believe her name was Eloise.

40:07.638 --> 40:10.139
You spent a... an evening
with young Eloise

40:10.190 --> 40:11.640
on top of my desk?

40:11.691 --> 40:13.359
She said that you'd given
her the night off.

40:13.393 --> 40:14.693
Wouldn't want a girl to starve.

40:14.728 --> 40:16.812
Hope it's not a firing offense.

40:16.814 --> 40:18.864
Oh, God, Crosley.

40:18.899 --> 40:21.116
Congratulations, Paul.

40:21.151 --> 40:24.487
I've decided you will
be the Site X liaison.

40:24.538 --> 40:26.322
What?

40:34.581 --> 40:37.216
This is K-6. Outside
line to San Francisco.

40:37.250 --> 40:40.085
<i>Douglas 8522.</i>

40:49.679 --> 40:53.516
<i>Hello?</i>

40:53.567 --> 40:56.735
Is this Douglas 8522?

40:58.355 --> 41:00.272
<i>Who's calling?</i>

41:04.744 --> 41:06.195
Put Jean on the phone.

41:07.364 --> 41:08.781
Inspector?

41:14.204 --> 41:16.956
<i>This is Inspector Dunn, SFPD.</i>

41:20.210 --> 41:22.378
<i>I'm afraid that won't be possible.</i>

41:22.429 --> 41:24.930
<i>There's been an incident.</i>

42:22.489 --> 42:25.357
Tell Callie I'll call
her as soon as I can.

42:57.390 --> 42:59.441
You know...

42:59.476 --> 43:02.611
it wasn't because of some Army code.

43:02.646 --> 43:05.898
<i>That's not why I didn't tell
you what we were building.</i>

43:07.484 --> 43:09.485
It was because I knew
what you would say.

43:11.154 --> 43:12.821
<i>You'd have probably talked me out of it</i>

43:12.872 --> 43:15.207
<i>before we crossed the
Pennsylvania border.</i>

43:16.993 --> 43:18.293
I'd have tried.

43:23.166 --> 43:25.968
I am sorry.

43:26.002 --> 43:29.004
<i>I had no right to make a choice
that big for the both of us.</i>

43:31.725 --> 43:35.144
So, now it's your choice.

43:35.178 --> 43:38.514
If you think that we should
go to Princeton, we'll go.

43:38.565 --> 43:40.349
We'll go right now.

45:46.309 --> 45:47.476
Abby.

45:56.137 --> 45:57.413
Frank.

46:01.284 --> 46:02.868
They told me...

46:05.761 --> 46:07.818
I thought you were dead.

46:10.056 --> 46:11.438
They lied.

46:12.842 --> 46:15.040
