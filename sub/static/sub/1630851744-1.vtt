WEBVTT

00:55.340 --> 00:57.407
Back in five,

00:57.441 --> 00:59.476
we are streaming live
from Bubble HQ.

00:59.509 --> 01:00.879
It's launch day
at Bubble.

01:00.912 --> 01:03.081
What incredible tech
are they about to unveil?

01:03.114 --> 01:04.748
We're going in.

01:12.556 --> 01:16.261
<font color="#00FF7F"> <i>Have you ever felt
completely alone?</i> </font>

01:16.294 --> 01:19.529
Standing on the edge
of things, so awkward,

01:19.563 --> 01:22.532
not daring to approach anyone?

01:22.566 --> 01:25.870
What if you could have
one perfect friend

01:25.904 --> 01:29.506
who thinks you're awesome,
who can help you find friends

01:29.539 --> 01:32.310
and make it all easy?

01:32.343 --> 01:34.678
<font color="#00FF7F"> <i>All staff
to the launchitorium.</i> </font>

01:34.711 --> 01:36.747
<font color="#00FF7F"> <i>Marc, they're ready.</i> </font>

01:36.780 --> 01:38.216
<font color="#00FF7F"> <i>Marc?</i> </font>

01:38.249 --> 01:40.919
So, this is it.

01:41.585 --> 01:43.955
This is finally it!

01:43.988 --> 01:45.722
The day that we at Bubble

01:45.756 --> 01:49.294
give the whole world
a new best friend!

01:51.628 --> 01:55.300
Marc! Marc! Marc!

01:55.333 --> 01:57.835
Aw!
We did this together, guys!

01:57.869 --> 01:59.837
This is what
it's all been for.

01:59.871 --> 02:01.272
Right back to the time
in the garage

02:01.306 --> 02:02.340
where Bubble started.

02:02.373 --> 02:04.675
My garage, folks. My garage.

02:04.708 --> 02:07.811
Of course, yes, Andrew.

02:07.845 --> 02:09.080
Thanks. Uh...

02:09.113 --> 02:10.114
But today,

02:10.148 --> 02:11.715
we take a huge leap

02:11.748 --> 02:14.419
from Bubble's phones
and tablets and watches

02:14.451 --> 02:17.989
to a whole new world
of connection.

02:18.022 --> 02:20.425
And at its heart, my code.

02:20.457 --> 02:22.459
My algorithm for friendship.

02:23.660 --> 02:25.696
The code that drives
your new best friend,

02:25.729 --> 02:27.065
the Bubble Bot.

02:27.098 --> 02:30.301
<font color="#00FF7F"> <i>Welcome
to the future of friendship.</i> </font>

02:30.335 --> 02:32.703
You wanna meet it? Okay!

02:34.038 --> 02:35.106
Me! Me!
Me, me! Over here!

02:35.139 --> 02:36.740
Pick me! Please!

02:36.773 --> 02:39.210
Do we have an "EllieB9"?

02:39.243 --> 02:41.812
Oh, my gosh!
That's me, that's me!

02:42.180 --> 02:43.513
Hi.

02:43.547 --> 02:46.417
Hi. So, that's your posts,
and friends,

02:46.451 --> 02:47.584
and photos, right?

02:47.617 --> 02:49.486
- Yeah.
- Okay.

02:49.519 --> 02:52.190
Ellie, this is for you.

02:52.223 --> 02:56.160
The world's
very first Bubble Bot.

03:07.005 --> 03:08.006
Wow.

03:08.039 --> 03:09.506
Go ahead.

03:22.253 --> 03:23.421
What's happening?

03:23.454 --> 03:24.788
It's getting to know you!

03:24.822 --> 03:26.924
Everything about you.

03:30.495 --> 03:32.063
Hi, Ellie.

03:32.096 --> 03:34.332
<font color="#00FF7F"> <i>Danger-Bunny!</i> </font>
That's my favorite show!

03:34.365 --> 03:35.599
Mine, too!

03:35.632 --> 03:37.701
Awesome!

03:37.734 --> 03:39.669
Infinite
downloadable skins!

03:42.106 --> 03:43.807
I love monkeys!

03:43.841 --> 03:46.310
Apps, contacts, photos, chat.

03:46.344 --> 03:47.744
Ooh, look at this!

03:47.778 --> 03:48.745
Whoa.

03:48.779 --> 03:50.415
Music. Of course.

03:51.782 --> 03:53.117
Jump on!

03:54.551 --> 03:55.820
- Whoa!
- Incredible safety settings

03:55.853 --> 03:57.522
to keep your parents happy.

03:57.554 --> 03:59.589
You can be anything
in the world?

03:59.623 --> 04:02.360
In the universe! Hold on.

04:04.295 --> 04:06.696
- Oh, I love space.
- Me too!

04:06.730 --> 04:09.367
Three-sixty degree
immersive projection.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.169
First selfie
from the red planet?

04:11.202 --> 04:12.336
Okay.

04:12.370 --> 04:13.670
Sharing.

04:14.771 --> 04:16.807
Constant connection
to the Bubble network.

04:16.841 --> 04:18.309
Oh, my gosh! Like it!

04:20.677 --> 04:22.113
What's she doing now?

04:22.146 --> 04:26.017
This is why we're here, Ellie.
To find you some new friends.

04:26.551 --> 04:28.086
Oh, really?

04:29.554 --> 04:31.621
GraceMay11 wants to be
an astronaut, too.

04:31.655 --> 04:33.257
- You wanna friend Ellie?
- Yeah, sure.

04:33.291 --> 04:34.492
Hey, Pete66.

04:34.525 --> 04:35.792
Yes!

04:35.827 --> 04:37.428
Pete's a fan
of <font color="#00FF7F"> <i>Danger-Bunny!</i> </font>

04:37.462 --> 04:38.563
- Hi, Ellie. This is so cool!
- Hi!

04:38.595 --> 04:40.098
Yeah, I went
to Space Camp last year!

04:40.131 --> 04:41.631
- Your best friend...
- Awesome!

04:41.665 --> 04:42.732
...out of the box!

04:42.766 --> 04:45.602
Let's do this!

04:45.635 --> 04:48.738
Let's make friends!

04:58.483 --> 04:59.517
Barney?

04:59.550 --> 05:02.453
- Yep?
- You have safety vest?

05:02.487 --> 05:04.754
- Uh-huh.
- And snack?

05:05.722 --> 05:06.991
Yeah, Gran.

05:07.757 --> 05:09.594
I'll see you later.

05:13.131 --> 05:14.432
Troll! Two o'clock!

05:14.465 --> 05:16.766
Omina mitotae!

05:16.800 --> 05:19.270
- I got you.
- Do you wanna trade spells?

05:20.704 --> 05:22.106
Whoa!

05:22.140 --> 05:23.341
Selfie!

05:24.674 --> 05:26.010
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

05:28.446 --> 05:29.981
Safe to walk.

05:48.366 --> 05:49.367
Wow!

05:54.804 --> 05:56.307
You got eyes, kid?

05:56.340 --> 05:58.176
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

05:59.243 --> 06:00.411
Ah, seriously?

06:07.652 --> 06:08.953
Ninja blast!

06:08.986 --> 06:10.421
Hey, you're a fan, too?

06:10.454 --> 06:12.223
Of course.

06:12.256 --> 06:13.690
- Hey!
- Hey!

06:13.723 --> 06:16.726
Look left, Ethan.
Right. Now let us cross.

06:16.760 --> 06:19.330
To the dark side!

06:20.965 --> 06:22.533
You have
nine new messages.

06:22.567 --> 06:23.700
You have ten likes.

06:23.733 --> 06:24.734
Message Abby,
I'll be there in five.

06:24.768 --> 06:25.937
Jack wants
to friend you.

06:25.970 --> 06:27.038
By Odin's beard,
you have six messages.

06:27.071 --> 06:28.573
- Did you see Ruby's post?
- Sharing.

06:28.606 --> 06:30.774
Hey, Savannah
just followed me.

06:31.609 --> 06:33.277
Isaac accepts
your friendship.

06:33.311 --> 06:36.247
So, you see how the magma
from the upper mantle

06:36.280 --> 06:37.682
pushes up into the chamber.

06:37.714 --> 06:38.815
- That's cool!
- Label chamber.

06:38.849 --> 06:40.651
Guys, guys,
is she coming yet?

06:40.685 --> 06:42.086
- This is going to be crazy.
- She's coming.

06:42.119 --> 06:44.121
- Hey, Savannah!
- Hey, Sav. Cute kicks!

06:44.155 --> 06:46.557
Thank you.
Hey, guys. Savannah here.

06:46.591 --> 06:48.059
So, later I wanna
talk to you guys

06:48.092 --> 06:49.660
about plastics in the ocean,

06:49.694 --> 06:51.562
and this new great blowout.

06:52.762 --> 06:54.031
Ooh.

06:54.065 --> 06:55.866
- Lame, Rich.
- Top quality footage.

06:55.900 --> 06:57.702
Like and subscribe...

06:57.734 --> 06:58.936
Posting to your channel.

06:59.704 --> 07:02.506
Weep, trollboy, I am fire!

07:10.982 --> 07:12.850
Nothing to see here.

07:15.987 --> 07:18.256
Wow, Barney.
It's your birthday.

07:18.289 --> 07:20.324
And you still
didn't get a B-Bot?

07:20.358 --> 07:21.791
<font color="#00FF7F"> <i>Thanks
for breaking that down.</i> </font>

07:21.826 --> 07:23.027
Barney is having a party.

07:23.060 --> 07:25.563
- Really?
- Uh, no, no, no.

07:28.132 --> 07:31.269
Fly free, little one. Phoosh!

07:31.302 --> 07:32.236
You okay, Barney?

07:32.270 --> 07:34.605
Yeah. Oh, sorry.
I'm in your shot.

07:34.639 --> 07:38.309
That's so sweet.
But I have a filter for that.

07:39.510 --> 07:40.611
<font color="#00FF7F"> <i>Ciao.</i> </font>

07:40.645 --> 07:42.513
This is your girl,
signing off.

07:42.546 --> 07:43.547
Love you, guys.

08:02.033 --> 08:05.102
- Create Sav's group chat.
- Check for Science Squad.

08:06.404 --> 08:09.240
Okay.

08:16.013 --> 08:20.251
<font color="#00FF7F"> <i>Okay.
18 minutes of recess hell.</i> </font>

08:20.284 --> 08:21.552
<font color="#00FF7F"> <i>You have got this!</i> </font>

08:27.925 --> 08:29.627
<font color="#00FF7F"> <i>Maybe not.</i> </font>

08:29.660 --> 08:31.662
- Barney!
- Oh, no.

08:31.696 --> 08:32.897
All alone again?

08:32.929 --> 08:34.164
No, I'm good. I just...

08:34.198 --> 08:35.499
- On your birthday?
- <font color="#00FF7F"> <i>No, no, no...</i> </font>

08:35.533 --> 08:38.001
<font color="#00FF7F"> <i>You have to be kidding me.
Who told her?</i> </font>

08:38.034 --> 08:39.937
Your grandma called
the school.

08:39.970 --> 08:41.772
I just need to go...

08:41.806 --> 08:44.442
I forgot my, uh, inhaler.

08:45.109 --> 08:47.645
The other one.

08:47.678 --> 08:50.781
- Got it. You need to sit down.
- Huh?

08:54.185 --> 08:56.120
This is gonna work, Barney.
You'll see.

08:56.153 --> 08:57.722
- It really won't.
- Yes, it will.

08:57.755 --> 08:59.390
It kind of makes things
a lot worse.

08:59.423 --> 09:00.925
- Wow.
- Brutal, man.

09:00.958 --> 09:03.427
Come on.
Bring it in, brave soldier.

09:03.461 --> 09:04.795
Whoa... What?

09:06.664 --> 09:08.666
- Oh, ho ho!
- Bring it in, Barney.

09:08.699 --> 09:09.767
Come on, Barney boy.

09:09.800 --> 09:10.901
Bring it in.

09:10.935 --> 09:13.037
<font color="#00FF7F"> <i>Wow.
How low can a kid go?</i> </font>

09:13.070 --> 09:17.274
Now, when someone comes along,
talk to them about a hobby.

09:17.308 --> 09:19.777
Didn't you write me an essay
on rock collecting?

09:19.810 --> 09:21.011
Yeah. No.

09:21.045 --> 09:23.748
Will you go talk to Barney?
He loves rocks.

09:23.781 --> 09:26.417
He needs friends.
It's his birthday.

09:26.450 --> 09:27.551
<font color="#00FF7F"> <i>Kill me now.</i> </font>

09:28.686 --> 09:29.987
Happy birthday!

09:30.020 --> 09:32.858
Ha-ha. Miss Thomas said
you wanna talk about rocks?

09:32.890 --> 09:34.091
Who likes rocks?

09:34.125 --> 09:36.761
So, you're into rocks?
That's nice.

09:36.794 --> 09:38.195
Uh...

09:38.229 --> 09:40.464
Seriously?
Dude, it's your birthday

09:40.498 --> 09:42.266
and you still didn't get
a B-Bot?

09:42.299 --> 09:44.435
Maybe he doesn't want a B-Bot.

09:44.468 --> 09:46.737
Maybe he prefers rocks.

09:46.771 --> 09:49.774
Hey. You're a rock star,
Barney.

09:49.807 --> 09:50.941
- Oh, snap.
- Ha-ha! You get it?

09:52.176 --> 09:54.211
Who's your favorite
movie star? The Rock?

09:54.245 --> 09:55.679
- Killer, Rich.
- Ha-ha-ha!

09:55.713 --> 09:56.848
You rock, man!

09:56.882 --> 09:58.816
Just gets funnier
and funnier.

09:58.850 --> 10:01.619
- Oh, hey, Barney.
- Can we rock up at your house?

10:01.652 --> 10:02.686
That's funny, Rich.

10:02.720 --> 10:04.955
Check out your awesome
rock collection?

10:08.926 --> 10:10.995
<font color="#00FF7F"> <i>No, Rich.</i> </font>

10:11.028 --> 10:13.998
<font color="#00FF7F"> <i>I'm afraid you can't come
to my house.</i> </font>

10:14.031 --> 10:15.966
<font color="#00FF7F"> <i>For some reason.</i> </font>

10:21.338 --> 10:24.008
Come on! Get off! Hey!

10:24.041 --> 10:26.010
It's my birthday,
you dumb goat.

10:26.043 --> 10:28.312
Sorry, are we
on the line? Is that...

10:28.345 --> 10:29.547
Yes, hello!

10:29.580 --> 10:31.081
So, today, Mr. Takahashi,

10:31.115 --> 10:33.417
Pudowski Novelty

10:33.451 --> 10:37.154
are very excited to offer you
this highly amusing novelty,

10:37.188 --> 10:39.056
the Brother Bouncy car monk.

10:39.089 --> 10:40.424
He wiggles, he bounces,

10:40.458 --> 10:41.725
- he's got...
- <font color="#00FF7F"> <i>Uh... No.</i> </font>

10:41.759 --> 10:43.961
- He'll hold your phone.
- <font color="#00FF7F"> <i>Uh...</i> </font>

10:44.595 --> 10:46.464
Oh, hi, Barney. Good day?

10:46.764 --> 10:48.098
Uh...

10:48.132 --> 10:51.068
Mr. Takahashi?
Are you there? Hello?

10:51.101 --> 10:54.171
Mom, did you unplug
my router again? I had Tokyo!

10:54.205 --> 10:56.440
I need this contract.

10:58.509 --> 11:00.744
Sure. It was fine.

11:00.778 --> 11:02.680
Barney!

11:02.713 --> 11:04.281
Mr. Takahashi? Hello?

11:04.315 --> 11:05.549
<font color="#FF9966"> <i>♫  Happy birthday to you  ♫</i> </font>

11:05.583 --> 11:08.252

11:08.285 --> 11:10.187
Come. Eyes shut. That's it.

11:10.221 --> 11:12.089
- Graham.
- Yep, yep.

11:12.122 --> 11:15.526

11:20.564 --> 11:21.967
For my lovely boy.

11:21.999 --> 11:23.367
Thanks, Gran! Ow!

11:23.400 --> 11:24.401
Oops!

11:24.435 --> 11:27.705
Made with love.
And our own goat wool.

11:27.738 --> 11:29.607
And from me...

11:29.640 --> 11:31.408
- <font color="#00FF7F"> <i>Could it be?</i> </font>
- Wait for it.

11:31.442 --> 11:33.310
<font color="#00FF7F"> <i>Is there
any possible way?</i> </font>

11:36.714 --> 11:38.115
Wow. Rock hammers.

11:38.148 --> 11:39.717
You always
did love your rocks.

11:39.750 --> 11:43.287
Yeah, I did. Always. Used to.

11:43.320 --> 11:45.222
- Thanks, Dad.
- And Gran.

11:45.256 --> 11:48.626
I just... The goats' wool
and my allergies.

11:48.659 --> 11:49.493
Oh, no, no, no.

11:49.527 --> 11:51.028
No one in Pudowski family
have allergy.

11:51.061 --> 11:52.296
What about Uncle Boris?

11:52.329 --> 11:55.566
He was possessed.
By a demon in a cashew.

11:55.599 --> 11:56.467
I don't know, Mom.

11:56.500 --> 11:59.103
What time your friends come,
Barney?

11:59.136 --> 12:01.138
- I cook all day.
- Wow!

12:01.171 --> 12:02.640
This real food.

12:02.673 --> 12:04.441
Yum! Schkembe!

12:04.475 --> 12:06.443
Bet your friends
never had tripe soup before.

12:06.477 --> 12:09.580
Ooh! I put on Zany Bogomil!

12:09.613 --> 12:12.149
Like last time we had party,
remember?

12:12.182 --> 12:14.385
When you were six.

12:29.233 --> 12:31.101
All right.

12:31.135 --> 12:34.705
Um, actually, the thing is...

12:35.739 --> 12:38.944
No one's coming to the party.

12:38.977 --> 12:40.311
No one?

12:40.544 --> 12:41.345
Huh?

12:41.378 --> 12:44.682
You ask and all say no?

12:44.715 --> 12:49.386
Son, we're
a little worried about you.

12:49.420 --> 12:53.791
You... You never go out with
anyone or have friends over.

12:53.825 --> 12:54.960
You know,
that's why we thought

12:54.993 --> 12:56.293
invite the whole class!

12:56.327 --> 12:58.395
Get the whole gang
over here, right?

12:58.429 --> 13:00.598
You know. Get you in the swing
of things with everybody.

13:00.631 --> 13:03.434
I make food
for all your buddies.

13:03.467 --> 13:05.135
I don't really have...

13:07.005 --> 13:10.174
You know, they probably
just didn't read the invites.

13:10.207 --> 13:13.611
No one does paper these days.
They send messages

13:13.644 --> 13:15.679
with their B-Bots.

13:15.713 --> 13:16.881
Really? You need a B-Bot

13:16.915 --> 13:18.415
to have a social life
these days?

13:18.449 --> 13:20.384
- Eh, pfft!
- Yeah, Dad, kind of.

13:20.417 --> 13:23.487
No. I don't want you addicted
to some device.

13:23.520 --> 13:25.356
You should be out there
in the woods.

13:25.389 --> 13:26.790
Kicking around with a buddy.

13:28.093 --> 13:30.160
Get out there, Barn. Interact.

13:30.194 --> 13:32.097
You don't wanna spend
your whole life

13:32.129 --> 13:34.698
glued to a...

13:34.732 --> 13:35.766
- B-Bots.
- What?

13:35.799 --> 13:37.002
It just a craze

13:37.035 --> 13:39.637
- and they cost a fortune.
- Mm-hmm.

13:39.670 --> 13:44.675
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
It's... it's a waste of money.

13:44.708 --> 13:46.011
No big deal.

13:46.044 --> 13:48.612
Bubble delivery.

13:51.615 --> 13:53.450
What? It can't be!

13:53.484 --> 13:55.920
Dad, you were kidding me!

13:55.954 --> 13:59.723
I knew you wouldn't just give
me rock hammers. I knew it!

13:59.757 --> 14:02.192
Oh. A rock.

14:04.963 --> 14:08.066
<font color="#FF9966"> <i>♫  We will, we will rock you  ♫</i> </font>

14:09.199 --> 14:10.434
Yo, I got
the whole thing, bro.

14:10.467 --> 14:13.737
It was hilarious, Barn.
You thought it was a B-Bot.

14:14.672 --> 14:15.806
A B-Bot?

14:15.840 --> 14:17.341
Let it go, Rich.

14:17.374 --> 14:19.243
You get out of here.

14:19.276 --> 14:22.346
You want I pour hot chicken
fat down your pants!

14:23.180 --> 14:25.416
Barney, what's going on?

14:25.449 --> 14:28.619
It's okay, Dad. Really.

14:29.253 --> 14:30.855
These are great.

14:37.661 --> 14:40.431
I hope they're not closed.

14:40.464 --> 14:42.666
B-Bot, B-Bot.

14:42.700 --> 14:45.636
Get him something useful
like a snow shovel.

14:46.603 --> 14:48.739
Or a cordless drill.

14:48.772 --> 14:51.475
It's what he really wanted.

14:51.508 --> 14:55.379
If his mom were alive,
she'd have known that.

15:00.151 --> 15:01.418
- Mom, people!
- Ooh!

15:01.452 --> 15:02.921
- People!
- Crazy lady!

15:02.954 --> 15:04.555
Whoa!

15:04.588 --> 15:05.756
Whoo!

15:05.789 --> 15:07.758
It's okay. It's fine.

15:07.791 --> 15:08.893
Whoa, whoa!

15:11.096 --> 15:13.230
Perfect!

15:14.199 --> 15:15.532
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

15:15.566 --> 15:18.036
- Argh! No, no, no.
- No! No, wait.

15:18.069 --> 15:19.369
- Hi! Please...
- Lady!

15:19.403 --> 15:22.639
...hold on just a second.
Uh, it's my son's birthday.

15:22.673 --> 15:25.542
I need a B-Bot.

15:25.576 --> 15:27.912
Maybe just the basic model?

15:29.346 --> 15:30.614
No, no, no.

15:31.415 --> 15:32.984
Hang on, please.
Please, please.

15:33.017 --> 15:36.286
I throw in goat.
Goat for a B-Bot.

15:36.320 --> 15:38.255
She real friend.

15:38.288 --> 15:40.491
And when you get bored
of this one,

15:40.524 --> 15:42.459
krrr, you can eat her!

15:42.493 --> 15:44.963
- Less waste, good for planet.
- Yeah.

15:46.097 --> 15:47.132
What?

15:47.165 --> 15:49.234
No. No, no, no. Come on.

15:49.266 --> 15:50.634
Three month wait?

15:50.667 --> 15:53.071
What is this?
Stalinist Russia?

15:53.104 --> 15:55.874
I am not afraid of you,
Bubble booble!

16:04.748 --> 16:05.850
What do you got
for me, pal?

16:05.884 --> 16:07.684
We got five pads
and some phones.

16:07.718 --> 16:09.154
Yeah?
What about that one?

16:09.187 --> 16:11.956
Uh, that one fell out
of my van earlier.

16:20.731 --> 16:22.733
Happy late birthday,
Barney.

16:25.170 --> 16:28.705
Wha... Dad! Oh, Dad!

16:28.739 --> 16:29.606
You got me one!

16:29.640 --> 16:32.476
- A real one this time!
- Yeah, I can see!

16:32.509 --> 16:35.146
Thank you, thank you,
thank you so much! And Gran.

16:35.180 --> 16:36.915
- Mwah, mwah.
- Oh, you good boy!

16:36.948 --> 16:40.218
Hey, if you hurry,
you can take it to school.

16:48.725 --> 16:50.727
Here we go.

16:54.899 --> 16:55.967
Huh?

17:07.078 --> 17:08.046
Uh...

17:08.579 --> 17:09.546
Huh?

17:12.116 --> 17:13.517
What?

17:21.657 --> 17:22.726
Seriously?

17:24.361 --> 17:25.896
Come on, come on!

17:28.066 --> 17:30.301
No. What? Why?

17:30.335 --> 17:32.337
Barney, school time!

17:49.620 --> 17:51.923
Hi. Insert registered name,

17:51.956 --> 17:55.260

18:01.498 --> 18:03.767
Look! My best friend

18:05.036 --> 18:07.804
I am, insert registered name's

18:07.839 --> 18:10.407
Insert registered name

18:12.609 --> 18:14.745
Uh, how? You're not online?

18:14.778 --> 18:16.080
How am I supposed to fix that?

18:16.114 --> 18:17.148
No problem.

18:17.181 --> 18:19.884
I'll scan my database
to find out how to do it.

18:19.918 --> 18:21.518
Oh, great. Cool!

18:25.056 --> 18:27.225

It's not my name.

18:36.533 --> 18:37.734
No problem!

18:37.768 --> 18:39.337
Please select a name

18:42.273 --> 18:44.275
- Absalom?
- Hi! Absalom?

18:44.309 --> 18:45.676
I am Absalom's B-Bot.

18:45.709 --> 18:50.081
No, no, no. My name is Barney.

18:50.114 --> 18:51.648
What is a Barney?

18:51.682 --> 18:53.450
I have only entries

18:53.483 --> 18:54.953
Shall I complete my download?

18:54.986 --> 18:56.387

19:19.344 --> 19:21.511
Wait!
Where are you going?

19:21.545 --> 19:22.779
Abu Dhabi,

19:22.813 --> 19:23.848
- Addis Ababa, Amsterdam...
- You're supposed to stay

19:23.881 --> 19:25.950
- within six feet of me.
- Arizona.

19:28.785 --> 19:30.221
Six...

19:30.254 --> 19:31.722
I'm so sorry.

19:31.755 --> 19:33.825
- Hey, what the heck, kid?
- What are you doing?

19:33.858 --> 19:36.294
- What am I doing?
- You walked under a truck!

19:36.327 --> 19:37.362
Hi. Absalom?

19:37.395 --> 19:38.863
What about
your traffic sensors?

19:38.896 --> 19:41.299
What is a truck?
Is it an airplane,

19:41.332 --> 19:42.699
an ambulance, an alligator,

19:42.733 --> 19:44.035
- an aardvark?
- Come on!

19:44.068 --> 19:45.203
We gotta get to school!

19:45.236 --> 19:46.270
What is school?

19:46.304 --> 19:47.571
You don't know
what school is?

19:47.604 --> 19:50.274
My solar battery function
has not been uploaded.

19:56.347 --> 19:58.082
Hi. Absalom?

19:58.116 --> 20:01.518
I'm Barney!
How come you don't know that?

20:01.551 --> 20:02.920
You're supposed to know
everything about me!

20:02.954 --> 20:04.989
I'm supposed to know
everything about you.

20:05.023 --> 20:08.592
You never
even said happy birthday.

20:08.625 --> 20:09.994
Whoa, whoa!

20:10.028 --> 20:13.131
Hey, no, no, no. I'll take you
to school tomorrow. Okay?

20:14.232 --> 20:16.566
Stay here and learn stuff.

20:16.600 --> 20:18.535
Just stay.

20:18.870 --> 20:20.104
Stay.

20:20.505 --> 20:23.640
Stay.

20:29.546 --> 20:32.050
I'm supposed to know
everything about you.

20:34.452 --> 20:36.753
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!
Top of the leaderboard!

20:36.787 --> 20:38.688
Whoo! Wanna follow me, Sav?

20:38.722 --> 20:40.058
- Uh...
- Fire unleash.

20:40.091 --> 20:40.992
Hey! What?

20:41.025 --> 20:42.927
It's a level 50
Easter egg, man.

20:42.960 --> 20:44.529
You're mine for an hour.

20:44.561 --> 20:46.763
- What?
- Loser! Loser!

20:46.797 --> 20:48.833
- Give it back!
- Ooh!

20:48.866 --> 20:50.667
Oh, come on! Really, guys?

20:50.700 --> 20:51.969
Not on top now, Noah.

20:52.003 --> 20:55.006
Don't focus on the negative.
It's very aging.

20:55.039 --> 20:56.974
A hundred
and thirty-eight friends

20:57.008 --> 20:59.243
are laughing. Meow.

21:00.744 --> 21:02.646
Three people
are following Science Squad.

21:02.679 --> 21:05.550
Three people actually
like science? Wow.

21:06.750 --> 21:08.920
Two people
are following Science Squad.

21:08.953 --> 21:10.288
Um...

21:10.321 --> 21:12.523
I could follow you, Ava.

21:12.557 --> 21:14.758
I... I got a B-Bot.
It's just...

21:14.791 --> 21:18.863
It's at home, um, downloading
my profile.

21:19.831 --> 21:20.898
Okay.

21:32.776 --> 21:34.879

21:34.912 --> 21:37.582
So, here we go... Ta-da!

21:37.614 --> 21:40.318
Wait for it.

21:40.351 --> 21:42.286
- Hey, come on! No?
- <font color="#00FF7F"> <i>No.</i> </font>

21:42.320 --> 21:43.888
I got a huge warehouse
full of these things.

21:43.921 --> 21:45.456
I can give you
an unbelievable deal.

21:45.490 --> 21:47.358
Hey, buddy. How's the B-Bot?

21:48.658 --> 21:49.994
The kids love 'em.

21:50.027 --> 21:51.628
Hey, I'm back.

21:54.866 --> 21:56.434
What?

22:01.839 --> 22:04.475
Opa!
Opa! Opa!

22:28.065 --> 22:29.799
What have you done
to my room?

22:29.834 --> 22:33.538
I have stayed here
and learnt stuff.

22:33.571 --> 22:34.572
What?

22:34.605 --> 22:35.772
I now know
everything about you.

22:35.805 --> 22:37.108
I know your underpants combust

22:37.141 --> 22:40.144
at a temperature
of 232 degrees Fahrenheit.

22:40.178 --> 22:42.346
Seventeen degrees
below the melting point

22:42.380 --> 22:43.713
of your inhalers.

22:44.549 --> 22:46.250
- Wha...
- I know you have 11 socks

22:46.284 --> 22:48.386
and four books detailing
the life of Bill the Bus.

22:48.419 --> 22:51.622
Now, I'm your best friend
out of the box, Absalom!

22:51.656 --> 22:54.125
No! A friend does not
go through your stuff

22:54.158 --> 22:58.829
or burn it or melt it
or dismember Mr. Bunky.

22:58.863 --> 22:59.997
Removing Mr. Bunky's head

23:00.031 --> 23:02.766
required a breaking point
of 7.6 newton.

23:02.799 --> 23:05.269
Stop! What is wrong with you?
Gran!

23:05.303 --> 23:06.370
Gran is 78.

23:06.404 --> 23:07.672
A former anti-communist

23:07.704 --> 23:09.540
with an approximate
weight mass of 360...

23:09.574 --> 23:11.442
Whoa-ho-ho! No, no. Cheeky.

23:15.513 --> 23:17.215
The B-Bot.

23:17.248 --> 23:18.950
There's something wrong
with it, Gran.

23:18.983 --> 23:20.218
It look all right
to me.

23:20.251 --> 23:21.652
It's not meant
to do that.

23:21.686 --> 23:22.954
I'm not meant to do that.

23:22.987 --> 23:24.655
Just like
all the others.

23:26.557 --> 23:29.360
Maybe turn it off
and on again?

23:31.028 --> 23:33.898
No! It just...
It doesn't work properly.

23:33.931 --> 23:36.167
44, 45, 40...

23:37.801 --> 23:41.672
I fix it! Pudowskis make do
and mend.

23:41.706 --> 23:44.175
Oh, if I just ram this
up power outlet...

23:44.208 --> 23:45.276
No!

23:45.309 --> 23:46.644
You'll make it worse!

23:46.677 --> 23:48.012
Oh, Barney.

23:48.045 --> 23:51.249
Once, I mend my own hernia
with bread knife and vodka.

23:51.282 --> 23:53.817
People don't mend stuff
anymore, Gran.

23:53.851 --> 23:55.319
They just take it back and...

23:55.353 --> 23:58.089
Take it back?

23:58.122 --> 24:00.992
You want I tell your father
it not good enough?

24:01.025 --> 24:01.926
No!

24:01.959 --> 24:03.961
That... No. But...

24:03.995 --> 24:05.496
...what am I gonna do?

24:05.529 --> 24:08.566
Ah. Take it outside.
Have fun with him.

24:08.599 --> 24:09.734
Uh...

24:09.766 --> 24:11.469
You remember
what Uncle Boris used to say?

24:11.502 --> 24:15.539
"The smart man can pickle
anything, even a glove."

24:15.573 --> 24:16.773
The point being?

24:16.806 --> 24:18.476
At least you're not
Uncle Boris.

24:18.509 --> 24:22.812
He crazy. Never the same
after that cashew.

24:23.447 --> 24:25.082
Argh!

24:25.116 --> 24:26.717
Right. Fine.

24:26.751 --> 24:29.020
You, come with me.

24:44.535 --> 24:46.337
Just follow me.

24:46.370 --> 24:47.872
Where are we going?

24:47.905 --> 24:49.407
Uh, nowhere.

we're going to, uh, "Nowhere"
to have fun with me.

24:56.681 --> 24:58.616
This is not fun, okay?

24:58.649 --> 25:00.284
Not fun. Okay.

25:00.318 --> 25:05.122
Look, I'm taking you back
to the Bubble store.

25:05.156 --> 25:08.159
I have to swap you for
a good one. No offense.

25:08.192 --> 25:09.660
But according to the sticker,

25:09.694 --> 25:11.228
I am your best friend
out of my box.

25:11.262 --> 25:15.032
Listen! Friendship
is a two-way street, okay?

25:15.066 --> 25:20.705
I get to choose my friends,

- Okay, guys, ready?

What is this?

25:40.157 --> 25:41.892
I am Absalom's B-Bot.

25:41.926 --> 25:44.528
Look! It's naked.

25:44.562 --> 25:46.630
Yo, I can see its ro-butt.

25:46.664 --> 25:47.765
- Ro-butt.
- Get it?

25:47.798 --> 25:49.367
'Cause it's a robot. It's...

25:49.400 --> 25:50.368
Um, Rich...

25:51.702 --> 25:53.437
Would you give it back,
please?

25:53.904 --> 25:55.005
Barney?

25:55.039 --> 25:56.842
Barnacle.

25:56.874 --> 25:58.409
I'm taking it back
to the store.

25:58.442 --> 25:59.944
Just please give it back.

25:59.977 --> 26:02.848
Yeah, sure, Barn. Take it.

26:10.254 --> 26:13.557
But first you gotta do
something for me.

26:13.591 --> 26:14.826
- Uh, sorry?
- Yeah.

26:14.860 --> 26:16.293
Your gran rang the school.

26:16.327 --> 26:18.796
You got me in trouble.
That's your fault, man.

26:18.830 --> 26:19.997
Your fault, dude.

26:20.030 --> 26:22.199
- What?
- So, come on. Cheer us up.

26:22.233 --> 26:23.467
- Cheer us up.
- Do something funny.

26:23.501 --> 26:25.736
I need some fresh content
for my channel.

26:25.770 --> 26:27.839
- Yeah, content.
- Something.

26:27.873 --> 26:29.306
- Rich, come on.
- Ooh!

26:29.340 --> 26:31.475
Why don't you sing
that song with Freak-bot?

26:31.509 --> 26:32.309
- Rich.
- Yeah!

26:32.343 --> 26:33.611
- Come on, Barney. Do it.
- Rich, no.

26:33.644 --> 26:34.645
- Do it, do it!
- There isn't a song.

26:34.678 --> 26:36.514
- Incorrect.
- No. Shut up.

26:36.547 --> 26:38.182
It is by Zany Bogomil.

26:38.215 --> 26:39.784

26:58.602 --> 27:00.304
I said shut it!

27:01.005 --> 27:02.706
Shut up!

27:04.175 --> 27:05.342
Why did you hit me?

27:05.376 --> 27:07.812
'Cause I don't like you,

27:07.846 --> 27:09.980
I don't like you, derp-droid!

27:10.014 --> 27:11.549

27:11.582 --> 27:13.551
What? Dumb bot.

27:13.584 --> 27:14.652
- Yeah.
- Yes!

27:14.685 --> 27:15.953
Okay, come on.
Let's...

27:15.986 --> 27:18.956
B-Bots can't shove!

27:20.591 --> 27:21.759
That's how you do...

27:21.792 --> 27:24.495
Incorrect. I can shove with
a compressive force capacity

27:24.528 --> 27:27.331
of 29 pounds per square inch.

27:29.600 --> 27:30.836
Ooh.

27:30.869 --> 27:34.405
My resin skin tenses on impact
to protect my CPU. Does yours?

27:34.438 --> 27:38.142
All right, that's it!
I'm gonna destroy you!

27:39.143 --> 27:41.045
Oh, no.

27:41.412 --> 27:42.413
Huh?

27:46.984 --> 27:48.219
Yo. Why does it look
like that?

27:48.252 --> 27:49.420
I'm gonna destroy you.

27:49.453 --> 27:51.255
- What's happening?
- I'm gonna destroy you.

27:51.288 --> 27:52.289
Dude, seriously. Back off.

27:52.323 --> 27:53.557
I'm gonna destroy you.

27:53.591 --> 27:55.059
Hey, no! Stop!

27:55.092 --> 27:56.760
Run!

27:56.794 --> 27:58.195
I'm gonna destroy you.

27:58.229 --> 28:00.531
I'm gonna destroy you.
I'm gonna destroy you.

28:00.564 --> 28:02.032
Is this fun, Absalom?

28:02.066 --> 28:03.701
- Yes! No.
- Help!

28:03.734 --> 28:04.735
- Oh, no.
- Yes!

28:04.768 --> 28:05.803
I'm gonna destroy you.

28:05.837 --> 28:06.938
Someone call the police!

28:06.972 --> 28:08.239
Contacting
local law enforcement.

28:08.272 --> 28:10.374
- I am sorry, bro. Seriously!
- I'm gonna destroy you.

28:10.407 --> 28:11.575
I'm gonna destroy you.

28:11.609 --> 28:14.278
Cut the live stream!

28:18.182 --> 28:19.450
Bros, it's pulling
my head off!

28:19.483 --> 28:20.551
41 newtons.

28:20.584 --> 28:21.485
- Bros!
- 42 newtons.

28:21.519 --> 28:23.153
Hey, no, no, no!
You can't pull his head off.

28:23.187 --> 28:24.655
We'll get in trouble!

28:24.688 --> 28:26.690
- Help!
- Okay, Absalom.

28:26.724 --> 28:28.025
I cannot pull his head off.

28:29.126 --> 28:31.762
That's it. You are dead meat,
Pudowski!

28:31.795 --> 28:33.330
Dude, you are finished!

28:33.364 --> 28:35.032
- Oh, yeah. We gotta run.
- We're coming for you!

28:35.065 --> 28:37.401
We gotta run right now!

28:37.434 --> 28:39.303
Whoa!

28:40.170 --> 28:41.672
What?

28:42.439 --> 28:44.208
Floor it!

28:46.277 --> 28:48.947
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo-hoo!

29:05.195 --> 29:07.731
That was awesome, okay.

29:07.765 --> 29:09.500
But terrible, but awesome!

29:09.533 --> 29:12.202
I mean, you can't hit people.
Especially Rich Belcher.

29:12.236 --> 29:14.638
But, oh, man!
You hit Rich Belcher!

29:14.672 --> 29:18.142
I don't get it.
B-Bots can't hurt people.

29:18.175 --> 29:20.244
They have mega safety controls
and stuff.

29:20.277 --> 29:24.415
Incorrect. I have no mega
safety controls and stuff.

29:26.083 --> 29:27.953
The settings
have not been uploaded.

29:27.986 --> 29:31.957
What? Really?
You're insane!

29:31.990 --> 29:33.024
Where are you going?

29:33.058 --> 29:34.658
To swap me
for a good one.

29:34.692 --> 29:37.328
No, no, no.
Hey, look. I've been thinking,

29:37.361 --> 29:39.697
and maybe I...

29:39.730 --> 29:41.699
Freeze! I think it's him.

29:46.938 --> 29:48.305
- Excuse me, sir?

29:48.339 --> 29:49.573
Easy.

29:49.607 --> 29:53.544
Okay. Both of you,
hands where I can see 'em.

That B-Bot is ours!

30:02.453 --> 30:04.188
- It's a lunatic!
- It's just dancing.

30:04.221 --> 30:05.890
- I taught it.
- I paid for that.

30:05.924 --> 30:06.992
It was just doing what I said.

30:07.025 --> 30:08.359
Take it away! It's crazy!

30:08.392 --> 30:09.894
At least
I'm not Uncle Boris.

30:09.928 --> 30:11.795
I'm... I'm sure
it's just a minor issue.

30:11.830 --> 30:14.966
It's violent, uncontrollable,
and highly dangerous.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.600
Okay, great.
Let me look into that.

30:16.634 --> 30:19.004
No. There's nothing wrong
with him.

30:19.037 --> 30:20.270
It assaulted a child!

30:20.304 --> 30:21.605
It didn't assault him.

30:21.639 --> 30:23.842
I hit Rich Belcher.
It was awesome, but terrible,

30:23.875 --> 30:25.043
- but awesome.
- See?

30:25.076 --> 30:27.012
- Barney... You were fighting?
- No!

30:27.045 --> 30:29.114
B-Bots
are incapable of violence.

30:29.146 --> 30:31.016
- Boink!
- Officer down!

30:31.049 --> 30:32.182
Bah, he had it coming.

30:32.216 --> 30:33.717
You can't just take it.
It's mine!

30:33.751 --> 30:34.886
I don't even know his name.

30:34.919 --> 30:36.821
Yes, you do! It's Absalom.

30:36.855 --> 30:38.455
- Hi, Absalom.
- What?

30:38.489 --> 30:41.592
According to our records,
it has no registered owner.

30:41.625 --> 30:44.029
- But I give all my funeral money...
- Mom...

30:44.062 --> 30:45.462
- ...to that man in the alley.
- ...please.

30:45.496 --> 30:47.132
You got it
from a man in an alley?

30:47.164 --> 30:49.134
Did you obtain
this bot illegally?

30:49.166 --> 30:50.401
What?

30:50.434 --> 30:52.837
This took a turn,
and we gotta get out of here.

30:52.871 --> 30:54.471
Send it to the crusher!

30:54.505 --> 30:55.572
- What?
- For all we know,

30:55.606 --> 30:56.740
it could kill someone.

30:56.774 --> 31:00.210
No. It's mine.
It was my birthday present.

31:00.244 --> 31:02.579
We'll return it to the
facility, run some tests.

31:02.613 --> 31:04.181
Do you want me to close
the whole store?

31:04.214 --> 31:07.584
No, no, no.
Uh, one crushing coming up!

31:07.618 --> 31:09.720
Use the recycler.

31:09.753 --> 31:11.156
<font color="#00FF7F"> <i>Adios,</i> </font> Absalom.

31:11.188 --> 31:12.924
<font color="#00FF7F"> <i>Arrivederci. Auf Wiedersehen.</i> </font>

31:12.957 --> 31:14.291
No, you can't do that.

31:14.324 --> 31:16.260
Dad, please.
It was sticking up for me.

31:16.293 --> 31:18.096
Barney, we gotta let it go.

31:18.129 --> 31:19.463
Let's take some details.

31:19.496 --> 31:20.932
- What was your name, sir?
- Uh...

31:20.965 --> 31:23.300
Absalom, will crushing be fun?

31:35.080 --> 31:36.246
Phew.

31:37.648 --> 31:38.582
- Hi, Absalom.
- Shh.

31:38.615 --> 31:40.350
- Happy birthday!
- What are you doing?

31:40.384 --> 31:42.319
A friend must stay
within six feet.

31:42.352 --> 31:43.787
We'll go
to the crusher together.

31:43.822 --> 31:47.624
No! Crushing is not fun!
It means smushed, flattened...

31:47.658 --> 31:49.259
Uh... Uh...

31:49.293 --> 31:50.527
A... A... A...

31:51.462 --> 31:53.263
Think, think, think.

31:53.297 --> 31:54.899
Annihilated.

31:59.104 --> 32:01.438
- Annihilated. Not fun!
- Shh.

32:01.472 --> 32:03.208
We gotta get out of here.

32:03.240 --> 32:04.608
Where are you...? Ow.

32:06.077 --> 32:08.579
Hey, stop! Hey!

32:08.612 --> 32:10.280
We gotta get out of here.

32:10.314 --> 32:11.515
No. Come back.

32:12.117 --> 32:13.885
- Whoa.
- Sorry.

32:13.918 --> 32:17.155
- Where are you going?
- You said, "Come back."

32:20.992 --> 32:21.993
Sorry, again.

32:22.861 --> 32:24.495
Bree, it got out!

32:29.299 --> 32:30.969
Sorry!

32:31.002 --> 32:32.302
- Where is it?
- <font color="#00FF7F"> <i>Ay!</i> </font>

32:32.336 --> 32:34.939
Lucha libre, third floor.

32:37.374 --> 32:40.178
- Stop!
- Oh, no.

32:40.211 --> 32:41.812
Space! Final frontier!

32:45.315 --> 32:46.617
Whew!

32:48.619 --> 32:49.586
Uh-oh.

32:50.121 --> 32:52.223
Follow me!

32:52.257 --> 32:53.757
Sorry, he's with me.

32:53.791 --> 32:54.993
He is unaffected!

32:55.026 --> 32:56.060
Invincible one.

32:56.094 --> 32:57.361
Space Lord.

32:57.929 --> 32:59.864
Hi, I am insane.

33:01.331 --> 33:03.333
Follow me.

33:05.970 --> 33:07.972
Are we having fun with me?

33:08.705 --> 33:10.108
You bet!

33:13.011 --> 33:14.545
You have to find it.

33:14.578 --> 33:17.148
It's gotta be here somewhere.
Keep looking.

33:17.182 --> 33:19.416
Huh?

33:20.118 --> 33:21.219
Where is he?

33:21.252 --> 33:23.353
Where did they go?

33:23.387 --> 33:26.224
Hi, I'm Sally Squirrel.

33:27.724 --> 33:30.727
- Potty time! Sing with me!
- No! Shush!

33:30.761 --> 33:31.795
You are dead meat.

33:31.830 --> 33:32.831
Preschool forest.

33:32.864 --> 33:34.431
<font color="#FF9966"> <i>♫  Number one or number two  ♫</i> </font>

33:34.464 --> 33:36.201
<font color="#FF9966"> <i>♫  Let's learn
where we pee and poo  ♫</i> </font>

33:36.234 --> 33:37.801
Power down, power down!

33:40.238 --> 33:44.042
Okay, everybody out.
Paws in the air.

33:44.075 --> 33:45.776
I know you're in there.

33:58.455 --> 34:00.457
Ugh! Really.

34:00.490 --> 34:02.526
- Barney!
- I'm sorry.

34:11.668 --> 34:13.237
How dare you! Are you
calling me a criminal?

34:13.271 --> 34:14.272
- Mom, no, no, no.
- You're not helping.

34:14.304 --> 34:16.706
I paid for it!

34:16.739 --> 34:19.610
- Hi, Absalom.
- Shh!

34:19.643 --> 34:21.712
I'm gonna take you home, okay?

34:21.745 --> 34:24.081
But you get
to choose your friends.

34:24.114 --> 34:25.382
And you don't choose me.

34:26.483 --> 34:29.353
I do, okay. I choose you.

34:29.386 --> 34:32.223
I can fix you, like Gran said,

34:32.257 --> 34:36.194
and I'll teach you
how to be my friend.

34:36.226 --> 34:37.996
Okay, Absalom.

34:38.029 --> 34:39.097
Okay.

34:39.130 --> 34:42.431
My registered name is Absalom,

34:42.466 --> 34:45.168
but my friends call me Barney.

34:46.271 --> 34:47.771
My friends call me...

34:49.007 --> 34:50.407
Ron Bintscatsco.

34:50.440 --> 34:53.177
Okay, Ron.

34:53.777 --> 34:55.213
Okay, Barney.

34:55.246 --> 34:56.281
One day parking ticket,

34:56.313 --> 34:57.414
next day firing squad.

34:57.447 --> 34:58.682
No, that's not
gonna be a problem.

34:58.715 --> 35:02.086
Hey, Barn. I am so sorry
about the B-Bot.

35:02.120 --> 35:03.154
I'll figure something out.

35:03.187 --> 35:04.521
It's okay, Dad. Not a problem.

35:05.656 --> 35:07.859
I... I think
it's gonna be fine.

35:11.996 --> 35:15.967
93, 94, 95, 96,

35:16.000 --> 35:19.037
97, 98, 99!

35:23.374 --> 35:26.077
One hundred
million units sold!

35:26.110 --> 35:27.644
Whoo! Yeah!

35:27.678 --> 35:30.480
Well, we made
100 million new friends,

35:30.514 --> 35:33.017
all helping kids connect,
meet each other,

35:33.051 --> 35:35.519
- interact.
- And all through their B-Bots.

35:35.552 --> 35:37.188
Making friends face-to-face?

35:37.221 --> 35:38.555
So last three millennia.

35:38.588 --> 35:39.623
That's not what...

35:39.656 --> 35:40.858
Some kids check in
with their bots

35:40.892 --> 35:43.727
a hundred times a day,
plus 11 times overnight.

35:43.760 --> 35:46.663
We've finally done it.
We've ended sleep.

35:46.697 --> 35:48.900
Uh, the algorithm
may need adjusting.

35:48.933 --> 35:50.500
Think of the data
we can harvest!

35:50.534 --> 35:51.970
No, no, no. I designed them...

35:52.003 --> 35:54.305
- In my garage.
- ...for making friends.

35:54.339 --> 35:55.739
Into dollars.

35:55.772 --> 35:57.574
If our share price
goes any higher,

35:57.607 --> 35:59.509
we'll have to give it
a space suit.

35:59.543 --> 36:03.147
So what about the B-Bot
that punched a child?

36:06.284 --> 36:07.919
It hit a cop?

36:07.952 --> 36:09.087
<font color="#00FF7F"> <i>And a child.</i> </font>

36:09.120 --> 36:11.621
It hit a cop.
We can't put that on the box.

36:11.655 --> 36:14.524
No, no. B-Bots are incapable
of violence.

36:14.558 --> 36:16.560
My algorithm
totally ensures no...

36:16.593 --> 36:18.528
- <font color="#00FF7F"> <i>Ow! Ow!</i> </font>
- <font color="#00FF7F"> <i>Ow! Ow!</i> </font>

36:19.563 --> 36:21.598
- I better look into that.
- You think?

36:21.631 --> 36:24.302
I mean, what if someone
gets injured?

36:24.335 --> 36:26.137
I, for one, could not live

36:26.170 --> 36:28.739
with what that would do
to our share price.

36:28.772 --> 36:30.008
<font color="#00FF7F"> <i>It's not a problem.</i> </font>

36:30.041 --> 36:32.877
<font color="#00FF7F"> <i>We performed a complimentary
in-store crushing.</i> </font>

36:32.910 --> 36:34.212
Good! Uh...

36:34.245 --> 36:37.015
Because if that
was still out there,

36:37.382 --> 36:38.648
we'd be toast.

36:39.283 --> 36:40.550
Uh...

36:45.023 --> 36:47.724
Shh. Guys, no clucking.

36:50.461 --> 36:53.663
Okay, Ron.
How to be my friend.

36:56.968 --> 36:59.404
A bunch of your code
is missing, right?

36:59.437 --> 37:00.804
The settings
have not been uploaded.

37:00.838 --> 37:03.807
So, I'm gonna teach you
to be my friend.

37:03.841 --> 37:05.410
And then
you can come to school.

37:05.443 --> 37:07.445
What is a friend, Barney?

37:07.478 --> 37:10.580
Well, a friend
is a person who, uh,

37:10.614 --> 37:12.316
likes, uh...

37:12.350 --> 37:13.817
Is always... I...

37:13.851 --> 37:15.953
A person who, uh, "likes,
is always, I."

37:15.987 --> 37:18.356
Okay.
Now I'm your best friend.

37:18.389 --> 37:20.525
Hey. Come back.

37:20.557 --> 37:23.593
No, no, no. There's a lot more
than that, Ron.

37:24.561 --> 37:26.297
You have to know
everything about me.

37:26.330 --> 37:27.764
You have to like me,
obviously.

37:27.798 --> 37:31.035
Like all the same stuff as me,
and you have to be on my side.

37:31.069 --> 37:33.637
But don't hit people.
Even Rich Belcher.

37:33.670 --> 37:35.772
Hair, brown. Height, 4'11".

37:35.806 --> 37:38.910
5'11" would be better.
You could reach high objects.

37:38.943 --> 37:42.313
Hey. A friend likes
everything about you.

37:42.346 --> 37:43.915
- What?
- Let's go to school.

37:43.948 --> 37:45.917
You don't even know
where school is.

37:45.950 --> 37:49.653
Alice Springs, Allahabad,
Anchorage, Albuquerque.

37:51.456 --> 37:52.756
Ooh. A-ha!

37:52.789 --> 37:55.293
Mom! You're shorting
the power out!

38:08.139 --> 38:09.874
You gotta fit in.

38:12.043 --> 38:12.844
Huh?

38:12.877 --> 38:15.480
Likes. Rocks, chess, <font color="#00FF7F"> <i>Pac-Man.</i> </font>

38:15.513 --> 38:16.581
- Bill the Bus.
- No!

38:16.613 --> 38:18.149
That was when I was,
like, two.

38:19.917 --> 38:21.552
Toast. But only for breakfast.

38:21.586 --> 38:23.354
Butter on its own.

38:23.387 --> 38:24.621
Mm!

38:33.564 --> 38:37.135
Dislikes. Possums,
musicals, school. Generally.

38:37.168 --> 38:39.070
The BuddyBench.

38:39.103 --> 38:42.140
Eugh! Worms. I don't trust
anything without a face.

38:47.411 --> 38:48.546
Stop!

38:48.579 --> 38:50.181
I am fitting in!

38:52.383 --> 38:54.018
You must always stay
within six feet.

38:54.051 --> 38:56.320
I will always stay
within six feet.

38:56.354 --> 38:57.522
Unless I say not to.

38:57.555 --> 38:59.590
I am not to stay
within six feet.

38:59.624 --> 39:01.492
No, no. Sometimes, yes.

39:01.526 --> 39:02.759
- Sometimes.
- And sometimes, no.

39:02.792 --> 39:04.629
- Yes.
- Like, if I had a bad day

39:04.661 --> 39:06.663
- or...
- Bad day. Always six feet.

39:10.568 --> 39:13.770
Allergies.
Goats, wool. Goats' wool.

39:13.803 --> 39:16.240
I'm basically
allergic to life.

39:16.274 --> 39:17.842
That's why I like rocks.

39:17.875 --> 39:19.676
That is sad and also tragic.

39:19.709 --> 39:22.113
What are you into, huh?
Electricity?

39:22.146 --> 39:24.248
Electricity is better
than rocks.

39:24.282 --> 39:26.184
Ron, what are you...

39:30.754 --> 39:34.292
Whoo-hoo-hoo! You got it!
You got the six feet!

39:38.529 --> 39:39.729
Hey! No, no, no. That's...

39:39.763 --> 39:41.199
Barney?

39:41.232 --> 39:43.733
I got a little break.
You wanna do something?

39:43.767 --> 39:45.503
Chess, maybe?

39:45.536 --> 39:47.804
Uh, thanks, Dad. I'm good.

39:49.073 --> 39:50.074
Okay.

40:06.624 --> 40:07.992
- Rocks.
- Electricity.

40:08.025 --> 40:09.627
Rocks are better.

40:09.660 --> 40:11.761
- Electricity.
- Uh, I said rocks.

40:11.795 --> 40:13.564
I prefer electricity.

40:13.598 --> 40:15.466
- Rocks.
- Electricity.

40:16.300 --> 40:17.767
List friends.

40:17.801 --> 40:19.237
Uh, next question.

40:20.471 --> 40:23.174
You know, I'm... I'm not
actually unpopular, you know.

40:23.207 --> 40:24.875
That would mean
they know I exist.

40:24.909 --> 40:26.577
- Perhaps you don't.
- Hey!

40:26.611 --> 40:28.246
List relations.

40:28.279 --> 40:31.616
Dad, Donka,
some Bulgarian uncles.

40:31.649 --> 40:34.018
Donka says, actually,
one was possessed,

40:34.051 --> 40:37.321
but I think it might
have been a nut allergy.

40:39.624 --> 40:41.592
There was Mom, too, of course.

40:41.626 --> 40:44.295
But, uh,
she died when I was two.

40:45.463 --> 40:48.532
And Dad moved us out here.

40:48.566 --> 40:53.604
It doesn't make me sad exactly
'cause I... I can't remember.

40:53.638 --> 40:57.074
But it did make
things hard for Dad.

40:57.108 --> 40:59.076
She was returned
to the facility?

40:59.110 --> 41:03.247
I guess. No receipt.

41:05.683 --> 41:08.219
Scratches neck
14.5 times a day.

41:08.252 --> 41:10.821
- What are you doing?
- I am learning about my friend.

41:10.855 --> 41:12.056
Oh, cool.

41:12.089 --> 41:14.492
Please slap my hand
to show we are bonding.

41:14.525 --> 41:16.560
Oh! Okay.

41:17.762 --> 41:18.963
You went to sleep!

41:19.597 --> 41:21.699
No. It was a move.

41:21.732 --> 41:23.934
Am I now your best friend
out of the box?

41:23.968 --> 41:26.304
You're not still
after that sticker.

41:29.140 --> 41:31.375
Oh, no, Ron. I'm so sorry.
Hold on. Hold on.

41:31.409 --> 41:33.978
- Connect. Connect.
- No! Stop!

41:34.011 --> 41:37.782
- Oh, no! Not that one! Ron!
- Connect. Connect. Connect.

41:37.814 --> 41:40.451
That's Savannah's house!

41:40.484 --> 41:42.586
Okay, key light,
Malibu filter.

41:43.387 --> 41:44.588
- Perfect.
- Boom!

41:44.622 --> 41:46.023
Oh, hey, guys.

41:46.057 --> 41:47.391
You just caught me chilling.

41:49.894 --> 41:52.630
Afloat. Aquatic.

41:52.663 --> 41:54.665
Accident.

41:57.935 --> 41:59.503
What is that?

41:59.537 --> 42:02.807
It sounds like a giant snake.
Or an evil clown!

42:02.873 --> 42:03.874
They live in the woods,

42:03.908 --> 42:05.609
and their heads go
all the way around!

42:09.513 --> 42:10.981
- Evil clown! Evil clown!
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

42:11.015 --> 42:12.783
I'm just really wheezy, guys.
I've been running.

42:12.817 --> 42:14.151
Ron!

42:16.454 --> 42:17.621
Barney Pudowski?

42:23.094 --> 42:25.129
You've ruined my aesthetic.

42:25.162 --> 42:28.799
- Sorry, Savannah.
- Nice pool.

42:28.834 --> 42:32.136
Wait. Since when
did you even have a B-Bot?

42:32.169 --> 42:34.739
And... Whoa. Look at him.

42:34.772 --> 42:36.974
I'm sorry. We're going
right now. I just...

42:39.243 --> 42:40.144
Uh...

42:40.177 --> 42:42.646
Barney, your B-Bot is,
like, super weird.

42:42.680 --> 42:44.548
- Yeah.
- And naked?

42:44.582 --> 42:45.549
Ew!

42:45.583 --> 42:48.052
And hold on a sec.
Why hasn't it friended me?

42:48.085 --> 42:50.888
Would you like to friend
@theSavannahMeads?

42:50.921 --> 42:53.724
No. He can't do
any of that stuff.

42:53.758 --> 42:56.828
He can't make friends or...
He's useless at all that.

42:56.862 --> 42:59.797
- Can't make friends?
- What?

42:59.831 --> 43:01.699
Barney,
don't say your weirdness

43:01.732 --> 43:03.234
has rubbed off on him.

43:03.267 --> 43:05.603
Making friends is, like,
what he's for.

43:05.636 --> 43:09.240
If he can't do that, he's,
like, literally pointless.

43:09.273 --> 43:12.643
Like, a lump of plastic
just following you around.

43:12.676 --> 43:15.045
Hashtag landfill.

43:15.079 --> 43:17.014
- I am for making friends?
- Ron...

43:17.047 --> 43:18.850
How do I make friends
for Barney?

43:18.884 --> 43:20.418
Come.

43:20.451 --> 43:21.986
- Seriously?
- Ugh.

43:22.019 --> 43:24.388
You share stuff about him.

43:24.422 --> 43:27.691
Like pictures of his food
or his wake-up routine.

43:27.725 --> 43:29.026
You search
for people who know him

43:29.059 --> 43:30.862
or like the same stuff as him.

43:30.896 --> 43:33.297
You show them pictures,
and then you get comments,

43:33.330 --> 43:35.199
and then you get
people that like him,

43:35.232 --> 43:36.801
and then you get
friend invites.

43:36.835 --> 43:39.470
- Boom! Now he has friends.
- Duh!

43:39.503 --> 43:40.872
Ron! We have to go!

43:40.906 --> 43:42.740
Does Barney need friends?

43:42.773 --> 43:45.142
Well, yeah! Or, fun fact,

43:45.176 --> 43:47.645
he will not survive
middle school.

43:47.678 --> 43:49.246
Savannah,
please don't tell anyone.

43:49.280 --> 43:53.017
I'm not supposed to have him.
He has to be a secret.

44:15.306 --> 44:17.741
She's rewiring <font color="#00FF7F"> <i>los electricos.</i> </font>

44:17.775 --> 44:19.643
Okay. Unicorn poo.

44:20.811 --> 44:22.112
It's great.

44:22.146 --> 44:24.916
You like it!
Well, shipping date, um...

44:24.950 --> 44:27.418
Ow! It shocked me!

44:37.728 --> 44:40.064
Mind if I leave it on?

44:43.400 --> 44:45.837
I am literally pointless.

44:45.871 --> 44:46.872
What?

44:46.905 --> 44:49.006
I cannot make friends for you.

44:49.039 --> 44:52.142
Yeah. Well...

44:52.176 --> 44:54.712
I'm not so great
at that either.

44:54.745 --> 44:58.884
You should see me
during recess. Oh, it sucks.

44:58.917 --> 45:01.051
I stand there every day,

45:01.085 --> 45:04.522
on my own,
on the edge of the yard,

45:04.555 --> 45:08.025
just hoping for a few people
to share a bench with.

45:08.058 --> 45:09.159
You know?

45:09.193 --> 45:12.296
But why would they?

45:12.329 --> 45:14.231
The last time any of them
came to my house,

45:14.265 --> 45:15.566
we set fire to them.

45:15.599 --> 45:17.801
Ow! Not again.

45:21.006 --> 45:23.507
I guess I'll just
sleep with it off.

45:24.575 --> 45:25.776
Good night, Ron.

45:48.098 --> 45:50.134
<font color="#00FF7F"> <i>They're psychos!</i> </font>

45:51.602 --> 45:54.940
It is them! I'd recognize
those ears from space.

45:54.973 --> 45:58.776
Okay. Location. GPS.
Uh... Get up the grid.

45:58.809 --> 46:00.244
Where is it?

46:00.277 --> 46:02.646
Uh, it's not actually
on the network.

46:02.680 --> 46:04.782
That's impossible.
So, I don't believe you.

46:04.815 --> 46:06.450
We track every B-Bot.

46:06.483 --> 46:08.920
- Um, yeah, but...
- Then the kid.

46:08.954 --> 46:12.389
I want everything. Contacts,
shopping habits, shoe-size.

46:12.423 --> 46:14.458
You mean his private data?

46:14.491 --> 46:16.327
Sure.
Why else do we collect it?

46:16.360 --> 46:18.930
We've got nothing on him.
He hasn't friended anyone.

46:18.964 --> 46:21.332
He doesn't blog, post,
or share.

46:21.365 --> 46:22.333
Creepy.

46:22.366 --> 46:25.003
The video was posted
by @theSavannahMeads.

46:25.036 --> 46:27.237
Her whole life is online.

46:27.271 --> 46:29.773
Andrew. Is it true?
It's still out there?

46:29.807 --> 46:33.344
The store made an error.
They squished Sally Squirrel.

46:33.377 --> 46:34.846
<font color="#FF9966"> <i>♫  Let's learn where we...  ♫</i> </font>

46:34.879 --> 46:37.514
That's awesome!

46:37.548 --> 46:39.951
What the heck
are you talking about?

46:39.985 --> 46:42.720
I looked into it. And...

46:44.655 --> 46:46.523
See? This is it!

46:46.557 --> 46:49.027
It's what I imagined
when I was his age.

46:49.060 --> 46:50.661
They're having fun!

46:50.694 --> 46:52.396
Fun?

46:52.429 --> 46:54.966
How... How can you
have fun offline?

46:55.000 --> 46:56.500
It's against nature.

46:56.533 --> 47:00.504
Andrew, I never programmed
B-Bots to laugh.

47:00.537 --> 47:03.674
I have to understand this.
Can we get a hold of it?

47:04.274 --> 47:05.709
Ho-ho, we will.

47:18.656 --> 47:21.725
My aerial?
No power in whole street?

47:21.759 --> 47:23.794
No. No idea.

47:31.936 --> 47:35.073
What? Ron, no!
You have to hide.

47:35.106 --> 47:36.407
You're not ready.

47:37.241 --> 47:40.277
I'm sorry.
I'll be back soon.

47:56.493 --> 47:59.196
There are no friends
in the shed.

48:00.397 --> 48:02.867
Hi! I am Barney's B-Bot.

48:02.901 --> 48:04.735
I live in the shed.

48:04.768 --> 48:06.270
I am for making friends.

48:06.303 --> 48:07.538
Idiot!

48:07.571 --> 48:11.208
I am sharing Barney's
breakfast. Do you like it?

48:11.241 --> 48:13.644
How about you?

48:15.546 --> 48:18.582
Would you like to comment
on this picture, old woman?

48:18.615 --> 48:22.453
Barney likes rocks, asthma inhalers,
and his grandmother's food.

48:22.486 --> 48:25.589
Will you come to my secret
shed and like him?

48:28.193 --> 48:30.461
No. No, no. No.

48:31.395 --> 48:34.531
Barney likes
rock hammers, too!

48:34.565 --> 48:35.900
I'm gonna be late.

48:35.934 --> 48:37.267
My pants are on backwards.

48:37.301 --> 48:39.436
That was Barney's
wake-up routine!

48:39.470 --> 48:41.005
- Okay.
- Friend request.

48:41.039 --> 48:42.006
Friend request.

48:54.518 --> 48:56.121
So a prime number

48:56.154 --> 48:58.322
is a natural number
greater than one

48:58.355 --> 49:00.125
that cannot be divided
by any number.

49:00.158 --> 49:01.391
I know you're keen,

49:01.425 --> 49:04.361
but it's not quite
recess yet, Barney.

49:04.394 --> 49:07.798
Oh, my asthma.
I need my inhaler, ma'am.

49:07.832 --> 49:09.566
Uh, I'll be one minute.

49:15.405 --> 49:18.009
Ron! What are you doing here?

49:18.042 --> 49:20.111
There are no
friends in the shed.

49:20.145 --> 49:21.846
I am for making friends.

49:21.880 --> 49:24.481
No! No, no, no. You have to go
before they come out for...

49:26.650 --> 49:27.986
Recess.

49:30.454 --> 49:32.356
You have
two new messages.

49:32.389 --> 49:34.225
Only two?

49:34.259 --> 49:36.060
Hey, Barn. You got a B-Bot?

49:36.094 --> 49:37.661
- Um...
- Hey.

49:39.030 --> 49:40.397
Awesome.

49:40.430 --> 49:42.200
Huh. Well, that went well.

49:42.233 --> 49:43.433
I thought so.

49:44.701 --> 49:45.870
Okay.

49:46.905 --> 49:48.405
Come on.

49:48.438 --> 49:51.910
Wow, that's so minimalistic.
It's like a blank canvas.

49:53.510 --> 49:55.013
Friend request.

49:59.017 --> 50:00.317
Recess.

50:00.350 --> 50:02.452
Maybe it'll be okay.

50:02.486 --> 50:03.955
Recess will not suck.

50:03.988 --> 50:06.523
You will have friends
to sit with on a bench.

50:06.557 --> 50:09.294
I don't know. Yeah. I guess.

50:09.326 --> 50:10.561
You will.

50:10.594 --> 50:12.897
- I have brought you some.
- What?

50:12.931 --> 50:14.933
I am literally not landfill.

50:16.067 --> 50:18.368
This is so crazy.

50:20.671 --> 50:22.472
Ron! Wait!

50:26.476 --> 50:28.279
You have five new friends.

50:28.313 --> 50:29.746
I did a search for them.

50:29.780 --> 50:33.051
Shayne likes low-priced alcohol
and conspiracy theories.

50:33.084 --> 50:35.320
He believes there's
a secret lizard government

50:35.352 --> 50:36.787
- beneath Switzerland.
- Shh.

50:36.821 --> 50:38.722
He will friend you
if he can stay in the shed.

50:38.755 --> 50:42.327
Barney! Bro!
Just for a year. Two max.

50:42.359 --> 50:44.028
Are those your friends,
Barney?

50:44.062 --> 50:45.063
Is this, like, a rave?

50:45.096 --> 50:47.764
This friend shared
your breakfast and liked it.

50:47.798 --> 50:48.732
Oh, yeah!

50:48.765 --> 50:50.434
He gets hungry like you.

50:50.467 --> 50:53.470
Your neighbor Mrs. Baxter's parrot
has one friend in common with you.

50:53.503 --> 50:54.906
Your neighbor, Mrs. Baxter.

50:54.939 --> 50:57.407
He commented on your photo.

50:57.441 --> 51:00.477
He has done other things
on your photo, too.

51:01.212 --> 51:02.579
Margaret will friend you

51:02.613 --> 51:03.747
- and share her...
- No.

51:03.780 --> 51:05.250
...purse, watch, anything

51:05.283 --> 51:07.085
if I please,
please just let her go.

51:07.118 --> 51:10.621
Now you have friends to
sit with on a bench at recess.

51:10.654 --> 51:12.824
I'm so sorry.
You can't be here.

51:13.757 --> 51:15.860
Barney, meet
friend number five.

51:15.894 --> 51:18.830
This tiny bald man
likes your picture so much,

51:18.863 --> 51:20.131
he is eating it.

51:20.164 --> 51:23.433
There he is! Logan!

51:23.467 --> 51:25.203
Friend request,
friend request.

51:25.236 --> 51:27.372
- Ron?
- Ron, Ron, Ron.

51:27.404 --> 51:30.674
- Yeah! Come on!
- Ron, Ron, Ron!

51:30.707 --> 51:32.643
Savannah Meads' mom
didn't recognize the boy.

51:32.676 --> 51:33.912
We're at her school now.

51:33.945 --> 51:35.746
Okay, sure.

51:35.779 --> 51:38.016
We keep this low-key,
people. Discreet.

51:38.049 --> 51:39.616
Nice and quiet, okay?

51:39.650 --> 51:42.020
- Love you guys!
- Ron, Ron, Ron.

51:43.121 --> 51:45.290
Pudowski!

51:45.323 --> 51:47.091
Yeah!

51:47.125 --> 51:49.294
Sticking it to the man!

51:49.327 --> 51:52.096
Principal's office. Now!

51:54.631 --> 51:56.935
Hey, bros. Ho-ho-ho-ho.

51:58.435 --> 52:00.504
Come on, Pudowski. Move it!

52:02.206 --> 52:04.309
You're not new, are you?

52:04.342 --> 52:06.210
You're that crazy broken dude
who punched me.

52:06.244 --> 52:07.979
How'd you do that?

52:08.012 --> 52:10.781
I have no mega safety controls
and stuff.

52:10.814 --> 52:14.419
Safety settings, parental
controls, account limits, all off!

52:14.451 --> 52:16.087
That's how come
he hit you, dude!

52:16.120 --> 52:18.722
I want mine like that.
Then it can hit me, too!

52:18.755 --> 52:20.457
I could get R-rated movies.

52:20.490 --> 52:22.793
Copy him. Find that code.

52:23.660 --> 52:24.996
Unlock.

52:25.529 --> 52:26.563
Unlock.

52:26.596 --> 52:28.399
He's gonna get
us a trillion views!

52:29.666 --> 52:31.302
I don't like you.

52:31.336 --> 52:32.736
I don't like you.

52:41.012 --> 52:42.213
Hey, guys.

52:42.246 --> 52:44.248
Savannah. What's going on?

52:44.282 --> 52:45.950
It's Bubble!

52:45.984 --> 52:49.519
My post is such a hit,
the whole company's following me.

52:49.553 --> 52:50.687
What post?

52:50.721 --> 52:52.423
Twenty thousand
friends love...

52:54.624 --> 52:58.262
What? I said he
has to be a secret.

52:58.296 --> 53:00.497
I know. But it went crazy!

53:01.631 --> 53:03.734
You're such
an actual freak, Barney,

53:03.767 --> 53:06.004
it's, like, almost cool.

53:09.207 --> 53:11.309
Pudowski!

53:11.342 --> 53:13.710
Pudowski! What is going on?

53:14.479 --> 53:16.447
Nothing, Ms. Hartley.

53:16.481 --> 53:17.915
You brought in a baby?

53:17.949 --> 53:19.716
Artificially
sweetened beverages?

53:19.750 --> 53:21.319
- A parrot.
- A parrot.

53:21.352 --> 53:24.989
Where is the bot?

53:26.424 --> 53:28.393
Call head office.

53:28.426 --> 53:30.428
Get him, boys.

53:31.561 --> 53:33.398
Unlock, unlock, unlock.

53:33.431 --> 53:34.598
Get 'em!

53:39.103 --> 53:40.338
- Unlock.
- Uh...

53:40.371 --> 53:43.707
Okay. Buy 10,000 mechbucks.

53:43.740 --> 53:46.576
Whoa! It works!
BubblePay has no limits!

53:46.610 --> 53:48.545
Give me weapons.
Give me upgrades.

53:48.578 --> 53:50.248
All upgrades unlocked.

53:50.281 --> 53:51.916
Hey! Jerk of Thrones.

53:51.949 --> 53:54.252
- What?
- Get them!

53:54.285 --> 53:56.553
Hey! Those are our bots!

53:56.586 --> 53:58.222
- Give them back!
- Whoa!

53:58.256 --> 54:00.324
Levelling up!

54:00.358 --> 54:02.160
- Whoa!
- My prank, Noah.

54:02.193 --> 54:03.327
Thanks for the ride. Oh!

54:03.361 --> 54:04.661
Rich, come back!

54:04.694 --> 54:06.931
Yo, Sav. Who's lame now?

54:06.964 --> 54:09.400
- Hey!
- Unlock.

54:09.434 --> 54:10.468
Do you wanna connect

54:10.501 --> 54:12.602
to all the users
of the Bubble network?

54:12.636 --> 54:15.572
You can access them all?
Um, yeah!

54:15.605 --> 54:18.509
Okay, hi, um,
everyone in the world.

54:18.543 --> 54:20.610
This is @theSavannahMeads.

54:20.644 --> 54:23.448
And this is
Nonsuch Middle School.

54:25.249 --> 54:26.817
<font color="#00FF7F"> <i>Incoming!</i> </font>

54:28.319 --> 54:32.323
It's <font color="#00FF7F"> <i>Mad Max</i> </font> meets
<font color="#00FF7F"> <i>Sesame Street</i> </font> live streaming.

54:32.356 --> 54:34.826
We think the safety controls
are off on all the bots.

54:34.859 --> 54:36.693
Uh, let's send out a patch.

54:36.726 --> 54:38.096
Yeah, we're on it!

54:40.431 --> 54:42.467
That was awesome!

54:42.500 --> 54:43.667
What the...?

54:43.700 --> 54:45.436
You shall not pass.

54:45.470 --> 54:47.171
Kiss my Sith Lord butt!

54:47.205 --> 54:48.705
Rabbits, attack!

54:48.738 --> 54:51.641
Destroy! Destroy! Destroy!

54:54.378 --> 54:55.880
Book a party at a night club.

54:55.913 --> 54:58.049
Invite everyone.
Except Savannah.

54:58.082 --> 54:59.183
Everybody, stop!

54:59.217 --> 55:00.451
Hey, Rich!

55:00.485 --> 55:02.786
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- Catch!

55:03.488 --> 55:05.289
Whoo!

55:05.323 --> 55:07.091
You got this on the live, bro?

55:09.626 --> 55:11.095
For the views!

55:11.129 --> 55:14.098
So it's basically kind of
the apocalypse, but fun!

55:14.132 --> 55:16.167
Hey, cut it out, Sav.
This is my thing.

55:16.200 --> 55:17.835
Sorry, Rich. I have...

55:17.869 --> 55:20.138
Four million, four hundred

- Do something!
- Hello?

55:37.687 --> 55:38.890

56:01.678 --> 56:03.680
Sharing "It pooped me."

56:03.713 --> 56:04.949
- Sharing "It pooped me."
- Sharing.

56:04.982 --> 56:06.716
- No. Stop it.
- Sharing. Sharing. Sharing.

56:06.750 --> 56:08.653
- Don't share that.
- Sharing "It pooped me."

56:08.685 --> 56:09.987
Uploading the patch now!

56:16.594 --> 56:17.761
That's the patch.

56:17.794 --> 56:20.865
Just in time.
Good thing nobody saw it.

56:21.933 --> 56:24.368
You just killed Bubble, Marc.

56:24.402 --> 56:27.405
Spread out. Find the rogue.

56:27.438 --> 56:31.275
How can I put this gently?
Get out!

56:37.714 --> 56:39.517
Hi, Barney.

56:39.550 --> 56:41.852
We have 43 new friends.

56:41.886 --> 56:44.889
Maybe you do.
But I've been kicked out.

56:46.357 --> 56:48.392
This way.

56:48.426 --> 56:49.460
Ugh!

57:06.711 --> 57:09.914
How could you? You dumb bot!

57:10.715 --> 57:12.917
I'm in so much trouble now.

57:12.950 --> 57:15.987
All you had to
do was just fit in.

57:16.020 --> 57:17.588
What was the point of even...?

57:17.622 --> 57:20.024
Barney,
are you my friend?

57:20.057 --> 57:21.125
What?

57:21.158 --> 57:22.326
What do you mean?

57:22.360 --> 57:25.463
My dad bought you for me.

57:26.364 --> 57:27.498
What's that?

57:38.976 --> 57:40.077
Where are you going?

57:40.111 --> 57:41.612
Friendship is
a two-way street.

57:41.646 --> 57:42.880
- What?
- I get to choose.

57:42.913 --> 57:44.215
You taught me.

57:44.248 --> 57:46.284
I didn't say
be more than six feet.

57:46.317 --> 57:48.152
But you are
having a bad day.

57:48.185 --> 57:50.388
You know what? I don't care.
Fine! Go on then.

57:50.421 --> 57:51.589
- I am going.
- Uh-huh.

57:51.622 --> 57:53.291
- Okay.
- Okay. I'll...

57:53.324 --> 57:54.592
- Okay.
- Okay!

58:08.639 --> 58:10.241
It's trending

58:10.274 --> 58:11.609
They've searched
the school, Marc.

58:11.642 --> 58:12.809
They didn't find it.

58:12.843 --> 58:14.578
Bubble shares
are crashing. Down 43%.

58:14.612 --> 58:17.615
We've got thousands of parents
complaining about B-Bot safety.

58:17.648 --> 58:21.385
We've got thousands of kids complaining
their bots won't do the same stuff!

58:21.419 --> 58:23.854
Marc, what do we do?

58:23.888 --> 58:26.824
I... Uh, I've...

58:26.857 --> 58:28.359
I wonder.

58:30.661 --> 58:34.765
Maybe being a guy who makes
his friends out of skateboards

58:34.799 --> 58:37.535
doesn't equip you to run
a global tech giant.

58:37.568 --> 58:39.503
Mm!

58:39.537 --> 58:40.938
Okay. Here's our story.

58:40.971 --> 58:42.306
We blame everything
on the rogue.

58:42.340 --> 58:44.642
A single unit with
a minor coding error.

58:44.675 --> 58:46.177
Minor? But the riot.

58:46.210 --> 58:48.245
What riot?
We hose down the Internet.

58:48.279 --> 58:50.081
Delete every video.
Take down every post.

58:50.114 --> 58:51.415
Any TV station broadcasts it,

58:51.449 --> 58:53.484
we buy the station and
replace it with cat videos,

58:53.517 --> 58:55.286
then we sue the kids
for misuse of product

58:55.319 --> 58:56.987
unless they sign
a binding yada, yada,

58:57.021 --> 58:59.623
and send the principal
a fruit basket.

58:59.657 --> 59:01.859
But what does
the genius think?

59:03.127 --> 59:07.365
Okay.
Andrew, you do this.

59:07.398 --> 59:09.700
Sweet justice pie.

59:09.734 --> 59:10.868
Hey, run off back to your lab

59:10.901 --> 59:12.570
and invent something
that doesn't kill us all.

59:12.603 --> 59:15.973
And, uh, you got an algorithm
for refilling this?

59:16.807 --> 59:18.542
We got an address
from the school.

59:18.576 --> 59:20.578
Pudowski. Oak Hill Drive.

59:20.611 --> 59:22.380
Bing bong belushi!

59:22.413 --> 59:23.414
Go!

59:28.285 --> 59:30.488
Huh?

59:30.521 --> 59:33.624
No. But Barney
doesn't even have a B-Bot.

59:33.657 --> 59:36.794
All the kids at school
confirm he does, Mr. Pudowski.

59:36.828 --> 59:38.062
He started a riot.

59:38.095 --> 59:40.264
I'm sorry, are you calling
my son a liar?

59:40.297 --> 59:42.466
Oh, Barney.

01:00:20.771 --> 01:00:22.673
Ron!

01:00:23.875 --> 01:00:24.975
What are you doing?

01:00:25.009 --> 01:00:27.645
Returning myself
to the facility.

01:00:27.678 --> 01:00:28.979
I am a dumb bot.

01:00:29.013 --> 01:00:32.983
No! No, you're not.
I'm so sorry.

01:00:33.751 --> 01:00:35.786
I was wrong.

01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:39.023
We did not fix me.
I did not fit in.

01:00:39.056 --> 01:00:41.392
Who cares? Neither do I.

01:00:41.425 --> 01:00:46.530
It doesn't matter.
'Cause you are my friend.

01:00:51.101 --> 01:00:53.337
Your best friend
out of the box?

01:01:22.166 --> 01:01:25.369
But still don't burn
my underpants.

01:01:25.402 --> 01:01:28.138
You know, I have been
worried about him, but, uh,

01:01:28.172 --> 01:01:30.007
I just... I work
these crazy hours.

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:31.242
The bot's in there?

01:01:31.275 --> 01:01:32.944
Okay. This thing is dangerous.

01:01:32.978 --> 01:01:34.712
We need to destroy it.

01:01:36.982 --> 01:01:38.249
- Let's run.
- Barney,

01:01:38.282 --> 01:01:39.985
are you in there?

01:01:40.017 --> 01:01:41.853
Just you and me.

01:01:41.887 --> 01:01:43.053
Mom,
do you have a key?

01:01:43.087 --> 01:01:44.355
We don't need anyone else.

01:01:44.388 --> 01:01:48.192
Hey, you're not in trouble.
Please, just let me in.

01:01:50.962 --> 01:01:52.162
Where is he?

01:01:54.598 --> 01:01:55.834
- Shh.
- No clucking.

01:01:55.867 --> 01:01:57.234
Could he
be with a friend?

01:01:57.268 --> 01:02:00.738
Well, he...
he doesn't really have any.

01:02:12.149 --> 01:02:13.784
Hey! Isn't that the kid?

01:02:13.817 --> 01:02:16.153
Go! Go, go, go!

01:02:16.186 --> 01:02:18.155
He's getting away!

01:02:18.188 --> 01:02:20.124
We need to go faster!

01:02:20.157 --> 01:02:21.592
No problem!

01:02:25.329 --> 01:02:27.966
Ron, you did it! Yes!

01:02:31.002 --> 01:02:32.837
Hey, down here!

01:02:34.405 --> 01:02:37.508
Hey, stop! Come back!
We just want the bot!

01:02:40.011 --> 01:02:41.445
Quick!

01:02:43.581 --> 01:02:44.582
Shh.

01:02:44.615 --> 01:02:48.053
"Poop Girl" is trending.
You have 19,032,000 likes.

01:02:50.788 --> 01:02:52.289
- He went this way!
- Shh.

01:02:52.323 --> 01:02:54.725
Hey, miss. You seen
a boy and a bot?

01:02:56.694 --> 01:02:58.395
Do I look like I care?

01:02:59.096 --> 01:03:01.599
Okay, sorry. My bad.

01:03:01.632 --> 01:03:02.834
What's going on?

01:03:02.867 --> 01:03:04.401
Bubble are looking for Ron.

01:03:04.435 --> 01:03:06.537
They blame him for the riot.
I have to protect him.

01:03:06.570 --> 01:03:08.873
Hey, dude.
I think that was Poop Girl.

01:03:09.975 --> 01:03:12.209
Savannah?

01:03:12.242 --> 01:03:14.411
"Poop Girl" has
20 million and 56...

01:03:15.947 --> 01:03:18.382
Poop Girl. That's...

01:03:18.415 --> 01:03:21.785
That's who I'm gonna be
for my whole life.

01:03:21.819 --> 01:03:22.820
No.

01:03:24.254 --> 01:03:25.322
You sure
he's not back there?

01:03:25.356 --> 01:03:27.224
- We gotta go.
- Wait.

01:03:27.257 --> 01:03:29.360
You're running away?
To the woods?

01:03:29.393 --> 01:03:31.528
Please don't tell
anyone this time.

01:03:31.562 --> 01:03:33.397
There are evil clowns
in there, Barney.

01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:35.366
Their heads go
all the way around.

01:03:35.399 --> 01:03:38.402
That's owls,
Savannah. I promise!

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:46.911
You lost them? No, no, no.
This is not happening.

01:03:48.545 --> 01:03:49.480
You know what?

01:03:49.513 --> 01:03:51.850
Access the cameras
on every B-Bot in town.

01:03:51.883 --> 01:03:53.417
Use B-Bots to spy?

01:03:53.450 --> 01:03:57.088
No. We're just recording for
training and monitoring purposes.

01:03:57.122 --> 01:03:58.990
- But Marc would never...
- Marc put a camera

01:03:59.024 --> 01:04:01.458
within six feet of every
young consumer in the country.

01:04:01.492 --> 01:04:04.228
And now you're
worried about privacy?

01:04:04.261 --> 01:04:05.529
Turn on the mics, too.

01:04:05.562 --> 01:04:07.598
Listen out for
"Barney," "Rogue Bot,"

01:04:07.631 --> 01:04:10.634
"Profit-sucking plastic
psycho." That kind of thing.

01:04:10.668 --> 01:04:14.538
We'll find him. Wherever he is
in that Podunk town!

01:04:17.374 --> 01:04:20.111
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
- Whoo-hoo.

01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:33.892
Whoo!

01:04:47.038 --> 01:04:49.339
Whoo.

01:04:49.373 --> 01:04:51.341
- Ron.
- In your face.

01:04:54.211 --> 01:04:56.915
Come on, Space Lord, fight me!

01:04:56.948 --> 01:04:58.016
You need a stick.

01:04:58.049 --> 01:05:00.051
- Searching for stick.
- Huh?

01:05:00.085 --> 01:05:01.251
Is this one good?

01:05:01.285 --> 01:05:02.586
Come back
and let me hurt you.

01:05:02.619 --> 01:05:04.321
Ron! That's way too big
for a stick!

01:05:04.354 --> 01:05:06.290
Look at mine compared
to yours!

01:05:06.323 --> 01:05:08.159
Please help.

01:05:08.193 --> 01:05:10.494
You have 0.85 friends.

01:05:10.527 --> 01:05:12.831
- You have 0.7 friends.
- Oh, wow, you're sinking.

01:05:12.864 --> 01:05:14.899
Hold on. Just...

01:05:14.933 --> 01:05:16.366
You have 0.2 friends.

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:17.468
Grab my hands!
I'm gonna get you out.

01:05:17.501 --> 01:05:19.070
I'm gonna get you out.

01:05:25.275 --> 01:05:27.711
You know what? You choose.

01:05:27.745 --> 01:05:29.881
Two-way street, right?

01:05:29.914 --> 01:05:31.049
That way is good.

01:05:31.082 --> 01:05:32.483
No, wait, wait.
Where are you going?

01:05:33.283 --> 01:05:36.988
Ron. Hey, wait.
Stop! Stop, stop.

01:05:39.023 --> 01:05:40.925
No! Ron!

01:05:49.934 --> 01:05:51.468
Gotcha! Whoa!

01:05:53.437 --> 01:05:55.639
Gotcha!

01:05:59.244 --> 01:06:02.312
What? Why on earth
would you do that?

01:06:02.346 --> 01:06:04.082
Do I have to like
the path you like?

01:06:04.115 --> 01:06:07.252
No!
But your path sucks!

01:06:07.284 --> 01:06:10.521
And seriously?
Off a cliff?

01:06:10.554 --> 01:06:11.388
I like,

01:06:11.421 --> 01:06:13.925
"Seriously?
Off a cliff?"

01:06:13.958 --> 01:06:15.827
That way is good.

01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:17.394
Log. Log.

01:06:17.427 --> 01:06:18.897
- Log.
- Here.

01:06:20.031 --> 01:06:21.833
Been eating
too much electricity?

01:06:21.866 --> 01:06:25.170
- Your muscles are under-sized.
- No, they're not.

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:30.440
Hey, Ron.

01:06:30.474 --> 01:06:34.578
Tell me something about you.
I never asked.

01:06:34.611 --> 01:06:37.282
I am a Bubble
generation one B-Bot.

01:06:37.314 --> 01:06:39.851
I currently have one friend.

01:06:45.656 --> 01:06:48.860
- Oh, wow. I found it.
- Nice!

01:06:49.726 --> 01:06:50.694
You wanna share?

01:06:55.233 --> 01:06:58.602
You have not shared
29 friend invites.

01:06:59.803 --> 01:07:01.705
Yeah. I know.

01:07:03.107 --> 01:07:06.044
If you don't ask,
they can't say no.

01:07:06.978 --> 01:07:08.378
Problem solved.

01:07:12.816 --> 01:07:15.286
You know who I had at my party
when I was six?

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:18.655
Savannah and Rich. For real.

01:07:18.689 --> 01:07:21.926
They were my friends just
because they lived nearby.

01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:27.531
But at some point you just...
You just get it...

01:07:27.564 --> 01:07:29.433
that you're not gonna be
one of the cool kids.

01:07:32.937 --> 01:07:34.605
Hey, who cares, right?

01:07:34.638 --> 01:07:37.909
'Cause I currently have
one friend, too.

01:07:38.910 --> 01:07:41.079
How long will we
live in the woods?

01:07:41.112 --> 01:07:42.914
I don't know.

01:07:46.617 --> 01:07:47.886
Forever?

01:07:55.994 --> 01:07:57.794
Do you know any stories, Ron?

01:07:57.829 --> 01:08:00.899
I can create one
from my available data.

01:08:00.932 --> 01:08:02.000
It will be called

01:08:02.033 --> 01:08:04.501
"The Awesome Adventures
of Absalom of Addis Ababa

01:08:04.534 --> 01:08:06.803
"and His Android, Alan."

01:08:08.306 --> 01:08:10.807
Once upon a time
in Addis Ababa,

01:08:10.842 --> 01:08:13.644
capital city of Ethiopia,
sovereign state in the Horn of Africa,

01:08:13.677 --> 01:08:15.179
with 100 million inhabitants,

01:08:15.213 --> 01:08:20.651
lived Absalom and his friend
Alan, a generation one android.

01:08:20.684 --> 01:08:22.653
That's a nice story.

Anonymouse3 created it.

01:09:07.531 --> 01:09:11.102
23 million friends love
"Poop Girl, the Remix!"

01:09:15.038 --> 01:09:16.073
Oh.

01:09:16.107 --> 01:09:18.575
Hi. Uh, we're Barney's...

01:09:19.109 --> 01:09:20.111
Um...

01:09:20.810 --> 01:09:23.281
He hasn't come home.

01:09:23.314 --> 01:09:26.017
And, yeah. So we're just...

01:09:26.050 --> 01:09:28.252
We're checking with his, uh...

01:09:28.286 --> 01:09:29.618
his fellow children.

01:09:29.653 --> 01:09:31.456
You are Barney's friend.

01:09:31.488 --> 01:09:33.091
You come to his
birthday party.

01:09:33.124 --> 01:09:33.957
Um...

01:09:33.992 --> 01:09:36.027
My goat eat
your slap bracelet.

01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:37.895
Oh! That party.

01:09:37.929 --> 01:09:41.131
Do you have any idea
where he is?

01:09:41.497 --> 01:09:42.566
Uh... Um...

01:09:42.599 --> 01:09:45.702
No, I, uh... Sorry.

01:09:50.674 --> 01:09:55.413
Oh, Mom. I work round
the clock selling novelty junk

01:09:55.446 --> 01:09:57.882
just to try to
give him a life.

01:09:57.915 --> 01:10:02.120
But I'm blowing it, Mom.
I... I've lost touch with him.

01:10:02.153 --> 01:10:03.620
Why didn't he come to me?

01:10:03.653 --> 01:10:07.025
Sometimes kid
protect grown-up.

01:10:07.058 --> 01:10:08.159
That's not right.

01:10:08.192 --> 01:10:09.526
He will be okay.

01:10:09.559 --> 01:10:12.964
Pudowskis are
brave and strong.

01:10:22.507 --> 01:10:25.877
There's a spider.
Literally, like, this big!

01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:27.945
A bird has commented
on your face.

01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:31.149
Oh, great.

01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:35.853
Where even are we?

01:10:40.124 --> 01:10:43.693
Recess. Now known as
20 minutes of extra math.

01:10:43.727 --> 01:10:45.029
What is
four-fifths as a decimal?

01:10:45.063 --> 01:10:46.531
What is the
square root of nine?

01:10:46.563 --> 01:10:47.631
Ugh! Seriously?

01:10:47.664 --> 01:10:49.100
You have to be kidding me.

01:10:49.133 --> 01:10:50.634
Alex, Jayden!

01:10:50.667 --> 01:10:52.769
Yesterday was sick, right?

01:10:52.803 --> 01:10:55.572
Sorry. Jayden's not
available right now.

01:10:55.605 --> 01:10:57.542
They've blocked me?

01:10:57.574 --> 01:10:58.675
Simplify the expression;

01:10:58.708 --> 01:11:01.345
three to the power
of eight minus eleven.

01:11:03.481 --> 01:11:04.549
Rich!

01:11:04.581 --> 01:11:05.582
Twenty-five million
friends love...

01:11:05.615 --> 01:11:09.187
- <font color="#FF9966"> <i>♫  It pooped me  ♫</i> </font>
- Wait! Seriously!

01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:11.923
- You have ruined my life.
- Uh...

01:11:11.956 --> 01:11:15.960
But, look. It's Barney, okay?
He's missing.

01:11:15.993 --> 01:11:16.828
What?

01:11:16.861 --> 01:11:18.996
You and me,
we got him in trouble.

01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:22.500
He's in the woods.
It's our fault he's out there.

01:11:32.443 --> 01:11:33.810
Access denied.

01:11:33.845 --> 01:11:36.813
- Here.
- Access denied. Access...

01:11:38.416 --> 01:11:39.951
Access.

01:11:41.385 --> 01:11:43.187
Let's find some place to camp.

01:11:50.727 --> 01:11:52.597
Everything's wet.

01:11:52.629 --> 01:11:53.763
How long is...

01:11:53.797 --> 01:11:55.032
"I don't know. Forever"?

01:11:55.066 --> 01:11:57.568
Twelve hours?
Twelve days? Twelve years?

01:11:57.602 --> 01:11:59.604
- Twelve decades?
- Stop asking dumb questions.

01:11:59.636 --> 01:12:02.206
I have 12% battery
power remaining.

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:04.175
Ron, come back.

01:12:04.208 --> 01:12:05.742
Have you got water damage
to the brain?

01:12:05.775 --> 01:12:07.011
I mean, seriously?

01:12:07.044 --> 01:12:10.081
If you go back, they will
send you to the crusher.

01:12:10.114 --> 01:12:12.649
Do you want to be recycled
as a lunch box?

01:12:12.682 --> 01:12:14.619
What is your plan? Is it,

01:12:14.651 --> 01:12:16.053
"Run! Run away!

01:12:16.087 --> 01:12:18.122
- "Go, go, go! We gotta run."
- Stop. Ron.

01:12:18.156 --> 01:12:19.023
Stop it!

01:12:19.056 --> 01:12:21.159
Avoids problems
89% of the time.

01:12:21.192 --> 01:12:22.560
You are so annoying!

01:12:22.593 --> 01:12:25.863
You are so annoying
43.8% of the time.

01:12:27.365 --> 01:12:30.001
Why don't you save your
battery by getting off my back?

01:12:32.403 --> 01:12:35.106
Argh. There's nothing
in these woods that'll burn!

01:12:37.208 --> 01:12:38.342
Incorrect.

01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:44.415
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

01:12:53.257 --> 01:12:54.691
What's that?

01:12:54.724 --> 01:12:55.927
I never told you that.

01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:57.528
I'm not afraid of the dark.

01:13:00.231 --> 01:13:01.632
Oh, no. Ron.

01:13:01.666 --> 01:13:02.967
My solar battery function

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.902
has not been uploaded.

01:13:05.870 --> 01:13:08.940
Electricity.
Of course you like it.

01:13:08.973 --> 01:13:10.740
Five percent
battery remaining.

01:13:10.774 --> 01:13:12.577
Five percent? Uh...

01:13:12.610 --> 01:13:15.079
Okay. Go to sleep.
Power down. Power down.

01:13:24.522 --> 01:13:27.425
Oh, Ron.
You're right about the dark.

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:33.763
After my mom died, I was
terrified every single night.

01:13:34.432 --> 01:13:35.600
And I wanted so bad

01:13:35.633 --> 01:13:38.169
to just run into my dad's room
and tell him...

01:13:40.004 --> 01:13:41.771
but what if
he was scared, too?

01:13:44.041 --> 01:13:45.042
Ron!

01:13:45.809 --> 01:13:47.245
Seriously, Ron?

01:13:51.916 --> 01:13:54.218
No one even knows we're here.

01:13:58.389 --> 01:14:01.993
<font color="#00FF7F"> <i>He's in the woods.
It's our fault he's out there.</i> </font>

01:14:02.026 --> 01:14:04.161
He left town for the woods?

01:14:04.195 --> 01:14:06.697
It's night.
The weather's getting worse.

01:14:06.731 --> 01:14:10.334
Pff. So access
the security cameras.

01:14:10.735 --> 01:14:11.736
Uh...

01:14:11.768 --> 01:14:14.605
There aren't any.
It's the woods.

01:14:14.639 --> 01:14:17.141
Insane. Okay.

01:14:19.343 --> 01:14:21.212
Let's put some in.

01:14:28.785 --> 01:14:30.321
Get me to Nonsuch.

01:14:30.354 --> 01:14:33.357
They're in the woods.
I have to meet Ron and Barney.

01:14:48.372 --> 01:14:52.243
One of these trees must have a
power outlet or something, right?

01:14:52.276 --> 01:14:55.112
Oh, this is not okay, Ron.

01:14:55.146 --> 01:14:57.348
Best friends don't die
on each other.

01:14:59.550 --> 01:15:01.385
Are we going
around in circles?

01:15:05.256 --> 01:15:09.193
Hey! Down here! Over here!
Help us! Help!

01:15:10.728 --> 01:15:13.297
Wait. They'll help me, but...

01:15:16.133 --> 01:15:18.336
No, no, no. Come on.

01:15:38.389 --> 01:15:39.457
What are they?

01:15:44.995 --> 01:15:46.897
Ow.

01:15:56.407 --> 01:15:57.575
I got nothing.

01:15:57.608 --> 01:15:58.909
We can't give up.

01:15:58.943 --> 01:16:01.679
People get lost in those woods
and never come out.

01:16:11.689 --> 01:16:13.290
You know what?

01:16:13.324 --> 01:16:16.093
We've done our best.
Let's call it a night.

01:16:16.127 --> 01:16:17.829
- What? We can't do that.
- But what about the boy?

01:16:17.863 --> 01:16:19.630
He's just not in there.

01:16:19.663 --> 01:16:22.600
We should try across
town tomorrow.

01:16:22.633 --> 01:16:23.667
Let's all go home.

01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:41.552
That's Savannah's
B-Bot. And Noah's.

01:16:47.525 --> 01:16:49.527
Ron.

01:16:55.065 --> 01:16:57.802
I guess we're
both literally landfill.

01:17:19.223 --> 01:17:21.258
"Poop Girl" has 32 million...

01:17:21.292 --> 01:17:23.527
Why is there mud
on your wheels?

01:17:26.230 --> 01:17:27.198
Huh?

01:17:37.843 --> 01:17:40.678
No, no. You can't go back.

01:17:42.213 --> 01:17:44.715
Must survive middle school.

01:17:44.748 --> 01:17:46.717
No, no, Ron.
They'll...

01:17:46.750 --> 01:17:48.586
They'll take you forever.

01:17:49.888 --> 01:17:52.356
They'll send
you to the crusher.

01:17:53.591 --> 01:17:54.826
Stay with me.

01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:58.562
There are no
friends in the woods.

01:17:58.596 --> 01:17:59.663
Ron.

01:18:00.698 --> 01:18:01.699
What is it?

01:18:01.732 --> 01:18:03.000
Alert Bubble.
Alert Bubble. Alert Bubble.

01:18:03.033 --> 01:18:04.068
Do you see that?
Oh, my gosh!

01:18:04.101 --> 01:18:05.102
Bubble Bot,
Ron Bintscatsco...

01:18:05.135 --> 01:18:06.270
- It's Ron.
- Hey! It's him!

01:18:06.303 --> 01:18:08.038
- And... And Barney!
- Barney?

01:18:09.106 --> 01:18:11.008
Barney! Come on!

01:18:11.041 --> 01:18:12.878
We're coming, brother.
Hang on there!

01:18:12.911 --> 01:18:14.211
- Barney, are you okay?
- Barney!

01:18:14.245 --> 01:18:15.513
It's his asthma.
He can't breathe right.

01:18:15.546 --> 01:18:17.849
Twelve-year-old boy.
Grade two bronchospasm.

01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:21.352
Why are you guys here?

01:18:21.385 --> 01:18:24.121
- Friends...
- Sixth birthday.

01:18:24.154 --> 01:18:25.824
Sorry.

01:18:25.857 --> 01:18:27.893
He thought that...
I... I know...

01:18:29.159 --> 01:18:31.195
I know you're not my friends.

01:18:33.163 --> 01:18:37.134
Well, we're not
not your friends.

01:18:43.807 --> 01:18:44.876
Over here!

01:18:44.910 --> 01:18:46.076
Yo, guys,
he's over here.

01:18:46.110 --> 01:18:47.311
Get down here. Let's go!

01:18:47.344 --> 01:18:48.579
He's hurt.
He needs help.

01:18:48.612 --> 01:18:50.614
- Quick! It's them. Help them!
- Okay, I can see them.

01:18:50.648 --> 01:18:51.782
Barney! Oh, Barney!

01:18:51.815 --> 01:18:53.183
Mr. Pudowski,
Mr. Pudowski, he's over here.

01:18:53.217 --> 01:18:54.818
Check his lungs
for a pulse or something.

01:18:54.853 --> 01:18:56.253
- Stand back!
- Oh, my Barney.

01:18:56.287 --> 01:18:57.354
All right, deep breaths.

01:18:57.388 --> 01:18:58.756
Everything's okay.
Dad's here.

01:18:58.789 --> 01:18:59.790
Help him, please!

01:18:59.824 --> 01:19:00.926
We've located the kid.

01:19:00.959 --> 01:19:02.192
It's them! They're safe.

01:19:02.226 --> 01:19:04.495
They found them!

01:19:04.528 --> 01:19:07.131
- What's happening?
- The bot saved the boy.

01:19:07.164 --> 01:19:10.902
What? That evil
profit-sucking thing!

01:19:10.936 --> 01:19:12.202
- Grab it!
- <font color="#00FF7F"> <i>I'm on it.</i> </font>

01:19:12.236 --> 01:19:13.370
- <font color="#00FF7F"> <i>Stand back.</i> </font>
- <font color="#00FF7F"> <i>Hey... Let me take him.</i> </font>

01:19:13.404 --> 01:19:14.572
- Give me the bot.
- What are you doing?

01:19:14.605 --> 01:19:15.773
- Stop! You can't take him!
- Leave him alone!

01:19:15.806 --> 01:19:16.807
- Stop it!
- It's dangerous.

01:19:16.841 --> 01:19:17.943
- He's not dangerous.
- No!

01:19:17.976 --> 01:19:19.443
You can't take him.
We won't let you!

01:19:19.476 --> 01:19:21.312
That bot is Barney's
best friend, dude.

01:19:21.345 --> 01:19:24.081
He just saved his life!

01:19:27.351 --> 01:19:29.186
- Oh, no.
- The stream's trending.

01:19:29.219 --> 01:19:31.422
People are calling
the bot a hero!

01:19:33.524 --> 01:19:34.525
Aw!

01:19:34.558 --> 01:19:40.065
Brave Bubble Bot saved boy.
RIP, Ron. How sad.

01:19:40.097 --> 01:19:42.666
- And yet how great for sales!
- What?

01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:45.469
Okay. Moving on!

01:19:55.512 --> 01:19:58.248
We've known Barney
since we were little.

01:19:58.282 --> 01:20:01.719
You were his best friend
in kindergarten.

01:20:01.752 --> 01:20:03.554
And you were mine.

01:20:04.688 --> 01:20:06.290
It gets complicated.

01:20:06.323 --> 01:20:08.525
Yeah, right.
Should I friend Barney?

01:20:08.559 --> 01:20:10.829
Searching for
"Barney likes pranks."

01:20:10.862 --> 01:20:12.097
No matches.

01:20:12.129 --> 01:20:13.230
Your pranks are lame.

01:20:13.263 --> 01:20:14.431
They're funny, man.

01:20:14.465 --> 01:20:17.869
If I don't do funny,
uh, I got nothing.

01:20:17.902 --> 01:20:20.270
Since when did
this stuff matter?

01:20:20.304 --> 01:20:25.242
Barney and Ron.
It's like we used to be.

01:20:25.275 --> 01:20:27.778
<font color="#FF9966"> <i>♫  It pooped me  ♫</i> </font>

01:20:34.019 --> 01:20:35.185
- Barney? Barney!
- Oh, Barney!

01:20:35.219 --> 01:20:39.623
Hey! Oh, Barney,
I am so sorry.

01:20:39.657 --> 01:20:40.859
I let you down.

01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:44.561
I know I'm always
overwhelmed with work.

01:20:44.595 --> 01:20:47.264
But I'm your dad, okay?

01:20:47.297 --> 01:20:49.134
You're like a
piece of my heart

01:20:49.166 --> 01:20:50.835
walking around the world,

01:20:50.869 --> 01:20:53.437
and I love you so much

01:20:53.470 --> 01:20:56.674
that it makes me strong enough
to deal with anything.

01:20:57.441 --> 01:20:59.176
Except losing touch with you.

01:21:00.377 --> 01:21:01.445
Just talk to me, Barney.

01:21:01.478 --> 01:21:03.447
- I'm trying!
- You're lonely? I get it.

01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:05.315
- Where's Ron?
- Just communicate.

01:21:05.349 --> 01:21:06.985
Ow! Hey!

01:21:07.018 --> 01:21:08.385
I've got a friend, Dad!

01:21:08.419 --> 01:21:10.922
The one that saved
my life, remember?

01:21:10.955 --> 01:21:12.656
- Where is he?
- Uh...

01:21:12.690 --> 01:21:15.325
Hi. I'm Marc Wydell
from Bubble.

01:21:15.359 --> 01:21:17.128
Where is Ron?
If you crushed him...

01:21:17.162 --> 01:21:20.230
No, of course not.
Barney, I invented B-Bots.

01:21:20.264 --> 01:21:23.267
They're my dream.
Connection and friendship.

01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:26.437
But it's not working.

01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:29.473
Except you and Ron.
I fixed him.

01:21:29.506 --> 01:21:31.742
- I wanna understand.
- What's up, Barney?

01:21:31.775 --> 01:21:33.210
Ron! You're okay!

01:21:33.243 --> 01:21:34.812
What's that?

01:21:34.846 --> 01:21:37.082
The new number one
on the high-five charts.

01:21:37.115 --> 01:21:38.582
I now know all 100.

01:21:38.615 --> 01:21:40.818
- Are you okay?
- Doing great, buddy!

01:21:40.852 --> 01:21:44.055
Let's go home and check out
your awesome rock collection.

01:21:44.089 --> 01:21:45.890
No. You like electricity.

01:21:45.924 --> 01:21:47.224
I do if you do.

01:21:47.257 --> 01:21:49.793
Wait. This isn't Ron.
What did you do to him?

01:21:49.828 --> 01:21:51.462
His code was unstable.

01:21:51.495 --> 01:21:53.198
So I re-installed
the algorithm...

01:21:53.230 --> 01:21:54.765
He fixed me. Selfie?

01:21:55.834 --> 01:21:57.401
- Old women. Not trending.
- Bah.

01:21:57.434 --> 01:21:58.937
Widowed dads, downer!

01:21:58.970 --> 01:22:01.371
- Hey.
- Enhance and post!

01:22:01.405 --> 01:22:03.373
Un-fix him. It's not him!

01:22:03.407 --> 01:22:05.242
N... No. It... It's okay.

01:22:05.275 --> 01:22:06.610
I backed up Ron to the cloud.

01:22:06.643 --> 01:22:10.215
I'll just log in and I'll find
the old... Huh?

01:22:10.247 --> 01:22:13.250
They can't lock me out.
I'm the CEO of Bubble.

<font color="#00FF7F"> <i>As the new CEO of Bubble,</i> </font>

- What?
- Argh.

01:22:25.163 --> 01:22:26.296
Barney!

01:22:26.330 --> 01:22:28.166
He's in the cloud.
That's what you said, right?

01:22:28.199 --> 01:22:30.267
- Well...
- So take me there.

01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:31.602
- I'm sorry?
- You heard my son.

01:22:31.635 --> 01:22:34.239
He needs to get
to the cloud thing.

01:22:34.271 --> 01:22:36.473
And I'm going with him! Uh...

01:22:36.507 --> 01:22:39.144
Barney, the cloud
is in a concrete fortress

01:22:39.177 --> 01:22:40.644
half a mile below Bubble.

01:22:40.677 --> 01:22:44.015
There are two million servers
with a zettabyte of data.

01:22:44.048 --> 01:22:45.716
How would you find Ron?

01:22:48.086 --> 01:22:50.255
He's my friend.

01:22:50.287 --> 01:22:54.159
So take me there
and get me in!

01:22:54.192 --> 01:22:55.459
Yeah! Go get

01:22:55.492 --> 01:22:57.528
- that psycho robot, dude!
- Go! Go, Barney!

01:22:57.561 --> 01:23:01.266
Okay, Bubble booble.
Let's go get Ron.

01:23:06.436 --> 01:23:09.240
<font color="#00FF7F"> <i>Okay. To get Barney

Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

01:23:32.596 --> 01:23:35.332
Yes! Ha-ha! Love it!

01:23:40.071 --> 01:23:41.405
- Hi.
- Hi there!

01:23:41.438 --> 01:23:42.706
How can Bubble help you?

01:23:42.739 --> 01:23:45.375
- Cleaner!
- Uh, ma'am, you can't just...

01:23:45.409 --> 01:23:46.643
- Sir?
- Ma'am?

01:23:46.677 --> 01:23:48.313
Yeah. Can you
take a look at this, please?

01:23:48.345 --> 01:23:49.746
It just keeps crashing on me.

01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:52.783
And there's a smell of burning
when I hit the space bar.

01:23:52.816 --> 01:23:56.221
Sir, this isn't a Bubble Store.
This is HQ.

01:23:56.254 --> 01:23:57.588
Oh. Uh...

01:23:57.621 --> 01:24:00.058
Oh! I just put Bubble
in my GPS.

01:24:00.091 --> 01:24:02.392
I wondered why
it was a 19-hour drive.

01:24:02.426 --> 01:24:04.195
Can you look at it anyway?

01:24:05.362 --> 01:24:07.198
Oh, silly me.

01:24:07.232 --> 01:24:08.632
Again, please.

01:24:10.001 --> 01:24:11.435
Oh! Ooh.

01:24:11.468 --> 01:24:14.038
Hang... Might be... Ooh.

01:24:19.610 --> 01:24:21.411
Pat down?

01:24:21.445 --> 01:24:24.315
So, workers, colleagues,
shareholders.

01:24:24.349 --> 01:24:27.018
Hi, shareholders. Love ya.

01:24:27.051 --> 01:24:31.122
Bubble's had a few
minor problems lately, right?

01:24:32.156 --> 01:24:35.626
Oof! Yeah.
But here's the good news.

01:24:35.659 --> 01:24:40.131
There's nothing wrong
with our B-Bots. It's kids.

01:24:40.164 --> 01:24:41.732
Kids are the problem.

01:24:41.765 --> 01:24:44.102
You give a child
an hour of screen time,

01:24:44.135 --> 01:24:45.435
you get peace and quiet.

01:24:45.469 --> 01:24:48.039
You have his friends around,
all hell breaks loose!

01:24:48.072 --> 01:24:49.240
Am I right, kids?

01:24:49.274 --> 01:24:50.909
Stick to your screens.

01:24:50.942 --> 01:24:54.645
Today, your best friend
out of the box becomes...

01:24:54.678 --> 01:24:57.447

you'll ever need!</i> </font>

01:24:58.950 --> 01:24:59.951
Okay.

01:25:04.621 --> 01:25:05.957
Huh?

01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:08.558
See? That's what it did
at my house.

01:25:09.861 --> 01:25:11.095
All good.

01:25:11.129 --> 01:25:12.462
What happened?

01:25:13.697 --> 01:25:15.532
Come on!

01:25:20.071 --> 01:25:22.140
Okay. Everybody out.

01:25:22.606 --> 01:25:24.142
This goats smells.

01:25:24.175 --> 01:25:25.609
Okay. This way.

01:25:28.313 --> 01:25:30.647
Server room.
Fingerprint recognition.

01:25:30.681 --> 01:25:32.449
Uh...

01:25:33.418 --> 01:25:34.618
I fix it.

01:25:37.688 --> 01:25:40.224
Lights, sprinklers,
air-con, security doors.

01:25:40.258 --> 01:25:41.792
Eat it all, Martina!

01:25:42.759 --> 01:25:45.163
What? Uh...

01:25:47.031 --> 01:25:48.465
What the...?

01:25:52.469 --> 01:25:54.872
- Okay.
- You guys go that way.

01:26:00.610 --> 01:26:03.014
Good to see you, buddy.

01:26:03.047 --> 01:26:04.349
What is going on?

01:26:04.382 --> 01:26:06.017
Uh, there's
a guy in reception.

01:26:06.050 --> 01:26:08.785
- What?
- It's his laptop.

01:26:08.819 --> 01:26:13.724
"Pudowski Novelty Exports"?
Pudowski! That kid!

01:26:13.757 --> 01:26:16.094
Uh, Andrew.
He's in the building.

01:26:16.127 --> 01:26:17.195
What?

01:26:17.228 --> 01:26:19.397
Hey, yeah.
I think he went down that way.

01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:20.797
Down here!

01:26:21.765 --> 01:26:23.868
Huh?
They were right here.

01:26:23.901 --> 01:26:25.702
That is weird.

01:26:26.971 --> 01:26:27.972
Okay.

- Okay.

01:26:42.854 --> 01:26:43.888
Okay.

01:26:45.789 --> 01:26:47.724
Of course
they're in the corridors.

01:26:47.758 --> 01:26:49.861
They didn't just vanish!

01:26:52.596 --> 01:26:54.132
Just go down here.

01:26:57.435 --> 01:26:58.668
Whoa.

01:26:59.137 --> 01:27:00.304
Okay.

01:27:12.682 --> 01:27:14.252
He never mentioned that.

01:27:16.487 --> 01:27:18.122
What are you doing?

01:27:18.156 --> 01:27:19.556
Uh... Uh...

01:27:20.324 --> 01:27:21.459
Uh...

01:27:21.492 --> 01:27:25.196
I... You have problem
with women in workplace?

01:27:25.229 --> 01:27:26.264
I never said that.

01:27:26.297 --> 01:27:27.432
You want to squeeze my knee?

01:27:27.465 --> 01:27:28.632
What?

01:27:28.665 --> 01:27:31.735
Andrew, we found this goat
in the electrics.

01:27:31.768 --> 01:27:34.372
Who are you people?
An improv troupe?

01:28:06.337 --> 01:28:07.737
Ron!

01:28:09.907 --> 01:28:10.908
Ron!

01:28:12.577 --> 01:28:15.279
Where is your
snotty little brat?

01:28:15.313 --> 01:28:16.881
He's looking for his friend.

01:28:16.914 --> 01:28:19.484
Friend? Friend?

01:28:19.517 --> 01:28:21.818
Hey, are you my friend?

01:28:23.488 --> 01:28:24.555
Sure, Andrew.

01:28:24.589 --> 01:28:26.824
They're just code. A trick.

01:28:26.858 --> 01:28:27.691
What?

01:28:27.724 --> 01:28:29.693
Data-harvesting
units controlled by us.

01:28:29.726 --> 01:28:31.628
Designed to give kids
a consumer experience

01:28:31.661 --> 01:28:35.066
featuring products and services
tailored to their browsing profile.

01:28:35.099 --> 01:28:37.634
The B-Bots know
everything about them.

01:28:37.667 --> 01:28:40.238
So we can sell them stuff.

01:28:40.271 --> 01:28:42.073
You're spying on kids?

01:28:42.106 --> 01:28:43.841
I hate kids.

01:28:43.875 --> 01:28:47.378
Uh, Andrew. There's someone
inside the cloud.

01:28:47.411 --> 01:28:49.847
What? It's him, isn't it?

01:28:49.881 --> 01:28:51.082
- Power down the cloud.
- No!

01:28:51.115 --> 01:28:53.251
- No.
- And send in security.

01:29:01.359 --> 01:29:03.027
Ron!

01:29:06.464 --> 01:29:08.266
Are you even here?

01:29:16.773 --> 01:29:19.410
Oh, no. Where are you?
Barney Pudowski.

01:29:19.443 --> 01:29:21.279
Um, seventh grade.

01:29:22.413 --> 01:29:24.115
Nonsuch Middle School.

01:29:29.554 --> 01:29:30.922
Uh... What is this?

No!

01:29:47.672 --> 01:29:50.308
Ron, I'll never find you.

01:29:51.008 --> 01:29:52.977
And you'll never find me.

01:29:55.346 --> 01:29:56.948
Find me.

01:29:58.349 --> 01:29:59.951
Find me!

01:30:05.389 --> 01:30:06.723
Please.

01:30:21.205 --> 01:30:23.374
Ron, I'm coming!

01:30:35.653 --> 01:30:36.786
Ron!

01:30:36.820 --> 01:30:38.322
Come on, come on!

01:30:39.457 --> 01:30:40.458
Yes! I'm in.

01:30:41.758 --> 01:30:43.728
Barney! He made it.

01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:46.497
I found you!
I did it! I found you!

01:30:46.530 --> 01:30:48.399
Uh, desk, desk.

01:30:49.734 --> 01:30:51.435
Oh! Okay. Uh...

01:30:53.170 --> 01:30:54.472
Here we go.

01:31:03.881 --> 01:31:06.317
Hi, Absalom?

01:31:06.350 --> 01:31:08.286
Ron, it's you!

01:31:10.787 --> 01:31:13.557
Now I know
what's wrong with him.

01:31:13.591 --> 01:31:16.494
Ron never had my algorithm.

01:31:18.162 --> 01:31:19.563
Whoa!

01:31:19.597 --> 01:31:21.465
That's his code?

01:31:21.499 --> 01:31:23.901
It's beautiful. Like...

01:31:24.735 --> 01:31:25.936
Alive.

01:31:31.208 --> 01:31:33.311
<font color="#FF9966"> <i>♫  Dikky, dikky, dakka  ♫</i> </font>

01:31:33.344 --> 01:31:34.979

into electricity...

01:31:35.012 --> 01:31:35.980
<font color="#FF9966"> <i>♫  Dikky, dikky, dikky, dakka
Dikky, dikky, dakka  ♫</i> </font>

01:31:36.013 --> 01:31:36.714
...and then put
you inside a rock.

01:31:36.747 --> 01:31:38.115
Electricity is best.

01:31:38.149 --> 01:31:40.217
- You are so annoying!
- Whoa, whoa...

01:31:40.251 --> 01:31:42.053
Please slap my hand
to show we are bonding.

01:31:42.086 --> 01:31:44.755
I am within six feet.

01:31:44.789 --> 01:31:46.357
Okay. Then just stay that way,
all right?

01:31:46.390 --> 01:31:49.327
'Cause we gotta get out
of here! Come on, Ron.

01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:50.394
Ron?

01:31:51.395 --> 01:31:52.663
Ron?

01:31:52.697 --> 01:31:54.365
Not, not your friends.

01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:57.301
I know. I...

01:31:57.335 --> 01:31:59.570
They are not having fun.

01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:24.729
It's weird.

01:32:24.762 --> 01:32:28.399
I used to think
that I was the lonely one.

01:32:28.432 --> 01:32:30.768
They need to upgrade to a Ron.

01:32:30.801 --> 01:32:33.237
I am for making friends.

01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:36.407
What?
You mean, for real?

01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:38.943
Uh, upgrade them
so they'd all be like you?

01:32:38.976 --> 01:32:40.678
Please connect me
to the Bubble network.

01:32:40.711 --> 01:32:43.581
Two hundred and twenty-five
million Rons out there!

01:32:43.614 --> 01:32:44.949
Please connect me.

01:32:44.982 --> 01:32:47.853
It would be insane!
I mean, amazing, but...

01:32:47.885 --> 01:32:49.420
It will be fun.

01:32:49.453 --> 01:32:50.488
Huh.

01:32:50.521 --> 01:32:54.158
We're right here.
In the middle of the network.

01:32:54.191 --> 01:32:56.761
Maybe we could really do this.

01:32:56.794 --> 01:32:59.430
It's our one chance.
Now or never.

01:33:01.665 --> 01:33:03.234
- Systems are down.
- It won't open!

01:33:03.267 --> 01:33:06.337
Uh... Come on, Barney.
What are they doing?

01:33:06.370 --> 01:33:09.273
"Upgrade all B-Bots
to be like Ron."

01:33:09.306 --> 01:33:13.677
Ron's code! Of course.
His code is the fix to mine!

01:33:13.711 --> 01:33:15.479
I can help them.

01:33:15.513 --> 01:33:18.916
Marc? He's helping us.
This is how we do it.

01:33:18.949 --> 01:33:20.718
- Yes!
- Come on, kid, open up!

01:33:20.751 --> 01:33:21.786
Okay, what do I do?

01:33:21.819 --> 01:33:24.121
Um, reboot... Wait!

01:33:24.155 --> 01:33:26.457
Please connect me
to the Bubble network.

01:33:26.490 --> 01:33:28.092
Oh! Finally, buddy.

01:33:28.125 --> 01:33:31.695
Okay. Hold on tight, guys.
You're all getting a Ron!

01:33:37.234 --> 01:33:39.570
Ron. Wait,
where are you going?

01:33:39.603 --> 01:33:41.305
Into the network.

01:33:41.338 --> 01:33:42.339
No. No way.

01:33:42.373 --> 01:33:44.708
You just copy your code
and send that.

01:33:44.742 --> 01:33:46.343
The settings
have not been uploaded.

01:33:46.377 --> 01:33:48.479
No, no, no.
His code is fragmenting.

01:33:48.512 --> 01:33:50.614
He'll disappear! No!

01:33:55.419 --> 01:33:57.655
We'll just have
to go. Forget it.

01:33:57.688 --> 01:33:59.590
Come on.
I'm not leaving you behind.

01:33:59.623 --> 01:34:01.058
Barney.

01:34:01.091 --> 01:34:03.761
I am for making friends.

01:34:03.794 --> 01:34:05.496
What?

01:34:05.529 --> 01:34:06.764
No. You're coming with me.

01:34:06.797 --> 01:34:09.266
How to be a friend.

01:34:10.836 --> 01:34:11.903
You taught me.

01:34:16.974 --> 01:34:20.578
No. Stay with me. Remember?

01:34:21.712 --> 01:34:23.714
Stay friends.

01:34:24.448 --> 01:34:25.816
We can fix it.

01:34:25.851 --> 01:34:27.485
You and me.

01:34:30.387 --> 01:34:31.555
Now or never.

01:34:39.597 --> 01:34:40.531
I guess we'll...

01:34:40.564 --> 01:34:43.133
we'll swap them all
for a good one.

01:34:44.768 --> 01:34:46.470
The best one.

01:34:48.739 --> 01:34:52.510
Go, Ron. You don't have
to stay within six feet.

01:34:52.543 --> 01:34:55.045
Go. Be everywhere.

Whoo-hoo!

01:35:59.076 --> 01:36:00.277
Hi.

01:36:00.711 --> 01:36:01.712
Uh...

01:36:02.847 --> 01:36:05.182

Oh. Uh...

Uh, the cameras.

Barney! Hey! There he is!

01:36:23.801 --> 01:36:25.070
Oh, Barney!

01:36:25.102 --> 01:36:26.905
Move it along.
Everybody outta here.

01:36:26.938 --> 01:36:27.939
Did you...?

01:36:27.973 --> 01:36:29.206
I'm gonna tell
you everything, Dad.

01:36:29.239 --> 01:36:30.774
On the way home.

01:36:30.808 --> 01:36:33.344
Okay. Great.

01:36:35.981 --> 01:36:39.116
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! Etcetera.

and I wanna thank you all
for your support

01:37:04.642 --> 01:37:07.846
over the last
32 historic hours.

01:37:07.879 --> 01:37:12.750
But I need to go now
to spend more time with my...

01:37:12.783 --> 01:37:14.151
contacts.

01:37:14.184 --> 01:37:16.855

Guys, where's my troll bot?
Wait...

01:37:59.596 --> 01:38:00.497
I get to choose.

01:38:45.242 --> 01:38:46.543
Oh. My bad.

01:38:47.145 --> 01:38:48.479
Thanks.

01:38:48.512 --> 01:38:49.646
Come on.

01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:51.415
- Hi, Barney!
- Hey!

01:38:51.448 --> 01:38:52.516
My bot does
that every time.

01:38:52.549 --> 01:38:53.650
- Hey there.
- Hi.

01:38:53.684 --> 01:38:54.886
- It's so weird.
- Hi.

01:38:54.919 --> 01:38:57.554
- He's, like, king of the bots.
- They love Pudowski.

01:38:57.588 --> 01:39:00.925
Barn, you have got to get back
in that Bubble cloud place.

01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:04.162
And get this bot to stop
making up its own game rules.

01:39:04.195 --> 01:39:06.131
Free upgrades
for everyone!

01:39:06.164 --> 01:39:08.365
How am I ever gonna win?

01:39:08.398 --> 01:39:10.300
Dude! We gotta tell 'em!

01:39:10.334 --> 01:39:13.670
You pranked a global
freakin' tech giant, man!

01:39:13.704 --> 01:39:16.141
Please let me stream
the reveal, bro, please?

01:39:16.174 --> 01:39:18.642
Take it from me, Rich.
Fame is overrated.

01:39:18.675 --> 01:39:20.145
Look what I brought.

01:39:20.178 --> 01:39:21.880
- I'll take one.
- One for everyone.

01:39:21.913 --> 01:39:23.747
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

01:39:23.781 --> 01:39:26.251
Barney! Hey! You see?

01:39:26.283 --> 01:39:28.719
I told you my bench
would work!

01:39:28.752 --> 01:39:30.788
Oh!

01:39:30.821 --> 01:39:32.957
Yeah. It's great.

01:39:34.125 --> 01:39:36.627
Mmm. Is all your
gran's food this good?

01:39:36.660 --> 01:39:39.496
Come... Come over sometime.
Hang out.

01:39:39.530 --> 01:39:41.598
I know you're dying to
see my rock collection.

01:39:41.632 --> 01:39:43.835
Will she set us on fire again?

01:39:43.868 --> 01:39:44.969
- Hope so.
- That was so fun!

01:39:45.003 --> 01:39:46.603
But you're gonna have to talk
to that goat,

01:39:46.637 --> 01:39:48.940
because I do not want
any more of my jewelry

01:39:48.973 --> 01:39:50.141
going through its intestines.
