           I'm okay.            

03:50.698 --> 03:51.964
          You're hurt.

            I, uh...            

03:56.370 --> 03:59.938

           Wait here.           

04:13.254 --> 04:15.454
 I don't have to listen to you. 

04:19.493 --> 04:21.892
       I don't know you.        

04:24.965 --> 04:27.432
    I just saved your life.     

04:27.434 --> 04:30.736
         Do me a favor          
         and wait here.

     [distant thunderclap]      

04:34.041 --> 04:37.009
          Who are you?          

04:37.011 --> 04:40.912
  You know, if I had to count

05:08.442 --> 05:11.410
           Let's go.            
     We need to get moving.     

05:11.745 --> 05:13.679
              We?               

05:15.516 --> 05:18.016
            Yes, we.            

05:18.018 --> 05:21.987
  Look, if you want to make it  
     out there on your own,     
         be my guest...         

05:21.989 --> 05:24.990
      But if I was the one      
     with the foggy memory,     

05:24.992 --> 05:27.693
     I'd want some company.     

05:27.695 --> 05:29.461
         Just in case.          

05:29.463 --> 05:31.697
     [distant thunderclap]      

05:33.100 --> 05:35.334
    He's not coming with us?    

05:35.336 --> 05:39.104
        No. He's looking        
for the other men in his squad. 

05:41.642 --> 05:43.942
         Are we at war?         

05:46.814 --> 05:49.014
        Here. Take this.        

05:49.016 --> 05:52.818
     We need to get moving.     
   We have a long way to go.    

05:52.820 --> 05:55.921
       And we don't want        
   to be travelling at night.   

06:50.811 --> 06:52.744
     This will have to do.      

06:54.982 --> 06:56.815
        They got lights,        

06:56.817 --> 06:59.951
          which means           
     they might have power.     

06:59.953 --> 07:03.755
       I'll look around,        
see if I can't find a generator.

07:18.071 --> 07:20.572
        I know, I know.         

07:21.141 --> 07:24.609
     Look, I'm sorry, okay?     

07:24.611 --> 07:27.879
     Just a little longer.      

07:27.881 --> 07:29.681
             What?              

07:31.885 --> 07:34.653
      Nothing. Stay here.       

07:34.655 --> 07:37.889
      The least you can do      
     is tell me your name.

           Joseph...            

09:34.942 --> 09:38.043
    You don't belong here.      

10:03.170 --> 10:05.704

10:05.706 --> 10:06.771
        [female scream]         

10:06.773 --> 10:09.074
         What happened?         

10:20.187 --> 10:24.289
          Don't worry.          
 They're not going to hurt you. 

10:25.258 --> 10:27.959
   Or anyone for that matter.   

10:34.401 --> 10:37.002
       What do you think        
       happened to them?        

10:38.005 --> 10:42.207
      [man] I'm not sure,       
     but whatever happened,     
  it happened a long time ago.  

10:43.110 --> 10:45.377
   You want me to move them?    

10:46.747 --> 10:48.179
            Please.             

11:05.866 --> 11:08.700
            [grunts]            

11:10.103 --> 11:14.005
      I'll bury your wife       
 but your work's not done yet.  

11:15.042 --> 11:19.377
       <i> You can thank me</i>        
    <i> for her proper burial</i>      

11:19.379 --> 11:22.080
    by serving as a warning.    

11:22.082 --> 11:26.751
        You stand watch         
        over her and us.        

11:26.753 --> 11:31.423
   <i> Show the monsters outside</i>   
<i>that there are monsters inside.</i> 

11:44.971 --> 11:47.472
      [generator running]       

11:47.474 --> 11:51.309
 [man] Generator should last us 
       through the night.       

11:51.311 --> 11:52.744
       I'll stand watch.        

11:53.714 --> 11:55.847
       How did you know?        

11:55.849 --> 11:59.317
           Know what?           

11:59.319 --> 12:02.220
  -That my memory was foggy...  
           -I never--           

12:02.222 --> 12:04.889
 No, when you found me you said 
    that if you were the one    

12:04.891 --> 12:07.258
      with a foggy memory,      
 that you'd want some company.  

12:07.260 --> 12:09.861
       How did you know?        

12:09.863 --> 12:13.098
      You hurt your head.       
           I assumed.           

12:13.100 --> 12:17.001
 That's a hell of an assumption 
to make based on a little blood.

12:23.977 --> 12:28.346
You'll need to learn to ration. 
    We don't have much left.    

12:29.082 --> 12:31.950
         Oh. I'm sorry.         
 If I'd have known I would've-- 

12:31.952 --> 12:35.053
   It's okay. You needed it.    

12:35.055 --> 12:37.355
          Good night.           

12:40.093 --> 12:44.429
[woman] Can I ask you something?
      About what happened?      

12:44.431 --> 12:48.066
  I can't remember before you   
 found me but I know deep down, 

12:48.068 --> 12:50.535
       it was different.        

12:50.537 --> 12:53.271
     Tell me, the world...      

12:53.273 --> 12:55.473
     How did the world end?     

12:55.475 --> 12:58.143
           It didn't.           

12:58.145 --> 13:01.946
      It just... changed.       

13:01.948 --> 13:06.050
       <i> Like everything,</i>        
   <i> things change and you have</i>  
     <i> to change with them.</i>      

13:07.053 --> 13:09.888
       Adjust, carry on.        

13:09.890 --> 13:13.091
       Make the decisions       
      that keep you going.      

13:13.093 --> 13:16.828
    No matter how difficult     
    those decisions may be.     

13:19.566 --> 13:23.868
    [woman] Though wise men     
at their end know dark is right 

13:23.870 --> 13:27.172
 Because their words had forked 
      no lightning they...      

13:27.174 --> 13:30.842
       <i> Do not go gentle</i>        
    <i> into that good night.</i>      

13:36.149 --> 13:37.916
    I think I was a teacher.    

13:44.057 --> 13:48.960
   Try to sleep. Maybe you'll   
    remember more tomorrow.     

13:50.263 --> 13:53.164
         [woman] Wait.          

13:53.166 --> 13:57.335
     <i> I think I remember.</i>       
          <i> My name...</i>           

13:58.104 --> 14:00.138
       My name is Sarah.        

14:04.511 --> 14:06.177
       Good night Sarah.        

14:37.878 --> 14:41.546
     You can come out now.      
         She's asleep.          

14:45.085 --> 14:48.620
[girl] Oh, it's about time. What
about you? How bad are you hurt?

14:48.622 --> 14:53.191
    Not too bad. I think one    
 of your stitches came undone.  

14:53.193 --> 14:55.193
             [girl]             
    Oh, and that's my fault?    

14:55.195 --> 14:58.329
        Didn't I see you        
   jumping off a school bus?    

14:58.331 --> 15:01.165
     -Fuckin' ballsy boss!      
     -Watch your language.      

15:01.167 --> 15:04.569
    [girl] I'm just shocked.    
    Half my time is usually     
     spent patching you up.     

15:04.571 --> 15:07.405
   Waste of time if you keep    
      taking stupid risks.      

15:07.407 --> 15:10.074
         You don't have         
    to be so mean about it.     

15:10.076 --> 15:13.344
  [girl] And you don't have to  
be a little bitch about hearing 
  some constructive criticism.  

15:13.346 --> 15:16.247
  You weren't the one stuck in  
  a bag the whole goddamn day.  

15:16.249 --> 15:19.584
I know. But things happened fast
   and I had to make a call.    

15:19.586 --> 15:22.453
       [girl] What call?        
   We're partners, remember?    

15:22.455 --> 15:25.490
  We take care of each other.   
  That's how it's always been.  

15:25.492 --> 15:27.659
   [man] But I found her, C.    

15:27.661 --> 15:30.261
        -I found Sarah.         
  -[girl] I don't believe it.   

15:30.263 --> 15:34.565
  After all this time. Now you  
 find her? How? Come on, boss,  
     you've gotta tell me.      

15:37.037 --> 15:38.469
         What the fuck          
        you looking at?         

15:38.471 --> 15:41.139
           -[screams]           
       -Whoa, whoa, whoa.       

15:41.141 --> 15:43.441
       Where do you think       
         you're going?          

15:43.443 --> 15:48.179
     She's losing it, boss.     
    If she starts screaming,    
 she'll give away our location, 

15:48.181 --> 15:50.114
     and then the monsters      
           will come.           

15:50.116 --> 15:52.650
   She's dangerous. I can sew   
  her mouth shut if you want.   

15:52.652 --> 15:55.486
            -[gasps]            
            -Sarah.             

15:59.059 --> 16:01.659
  Let her go. I like it better  
with just the two of us anyway. 

16:04.331 --> 16:08.099
      -Where do you think       
   you're going little lady?    
          -Let me go!           

16:08.101 --> 16:12.370
I can smell it on you! The food!
    You have food don't you?    

16:12.372 --> 16:15.239
     I will find it on you,     
           I promise.           

16:15.241 --> 16:18.743
            -Please!            
  Please? No, no, no pleases.   

16:18.745 --> 16:22.714
   I'm going to eat your face   
   after I carve you up and--   

16:22.716 --> 16:24.615
          -Let her go.          
       -Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!       

16:24.617 --> 16:26.718
    Don't you go sneaking up    
    behind Tommy like that.     

16:26.720 --> 16:28.486
    Bad things will happen.     

16:28.488 --> 16:31.456
 That woman means a lot to me.  

16:33.460 --> 16:36.494
  She smells like raspberries.  

16:36.496 --> 16:41.065
          Let her go.           

16:41.067 --> 16:43.668

           -[screams]           

16:45.438 --> 16:48.373
        Yeah, she does.         

16:51.378 --> 16:54.512
            Come on.            
     Let's get back inside.     

16:56.649 --> 16:58.616
      You don't trust me.       

16:58.618 --> 17:01.419
      How can I trust you?      

17:03.356 --> 17:05.656
        In this world...        

17:05.657 --> 17:08.393
        you gotta choose        
       to trust someone.        

17:09.628 --> 17:11.229
            Take it.            

17:13.700 --> 17:15.733
          I trust you.          

17:28.281 --> 17:31.482
      Did I miss anything?      
   Come on boss, fill me in.    

17:31.484 --> 17:35.787
    -Was it another monster?    
[sighs] I knew she was trouble. 
       -Shut up, Caitlyn.       

17:35.789 --> 17:39.657
  First she eats all our food.  
      Who knows what else       
       she's capable of.

17:42.529 --> 17:45.496
           Oh, good.            
 The crazy woman has your gun.  

17:46.666 --> 17:49.567
      I want some answers.      

17:50.470 --> 17:52.470
             Okay.              

17:52.472 --> 17:54.705
      Why did you tell him      
   I was so important to you?   

17:54.707 --> 17:58.209
       What am I to you?        

17:59.379 --> 18:03.247
          Everything.           
    You're everything to me.    

18:03.249 --> 18:08.086
       I don't know you.        
I've never met you before today.

18:08.088 --> 18:11.589
   -That's not entirely true.   
  -What are you talking about?  

18:11.591 --> 18:13.591
    Tell me what's going on!    

18:13.593 --> 18:17.295
-She's freaking out again, boss.
   -And what the hell is she?   

18:17.297 --> 18:21.599
  The name's Caitlyn. And I've  
   been Joseph's friend here    
for a lot longer than you have. 

18:21.601 --> 18:24.235
  Give her some time, Caitlyn.  

18:24.237 --> 18:27.138
I'm just saying, she should drop
   the whole bitch attitude.    

18:28.508 --> 18:31.275
           The doll,            
     she called you Joseph.     

18:33.680 --> 18:34.679
              Yes.              

18:34.681 --> 18:38.182
       That's your name?        

18:38.184 --> 18:40.151
   God, J, is the bitch deaf    
          and stupid?           

18:40.153 --> 18:42.753
           -Caitlyn!            
        -I'll be quiet.         

18:44.691 --> 18:46.557
        I knew a Joseph.        

18:49.162 --> 18:51.863
     He meant a lot to me.      
          I know that.          

18:51.865 --> 18:54.732
      He was your husband.      

18:54.734 --> 18:58.736
      Yes! Uh... No. He...      

19:04.177 --> 19:06.577
       He is my husband.        

19:09.282 --> 19:11.816
  Do you remember your house?   

19:20.627 --> 19:22.193
          I remember.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.596
              You.              

20:00.967 --> 20:02.867
      Do you remember me?       

20:09.576 --> 20:10.841
             I do.              

20:13.813 --> 20:14.812
            Joseph?             

20:14.814 --> 20:16.514
       I found you, baby.       

20:16.516 --> 20:18.516
            Joseph!             

20:26.292 --> 20:27.959
        I remember you.         

20:34.934 --> 20:37.401
 I remember our life together.  

20:40.573 --> 20:43.307
     I remember our lives.      

20:43.309 --> 20:45.509
          I remember.           

20:54.654 --> 20:56.854
            Oh my...            

21:09.435 --> 21:10.835
            I died?             

21:12.639 --> 21:15.673
         Yes. You did.          

21:25.685 --> 21:27.618
           Joseph...            

21:29.555 --> 21:31.622
         Where are we?          

21:43.002 --> 21:45.569
      Tell me how I died.       

21:45.571 --> 21:48.372
    It'll help me remember.     

21:49.609 --> 21:51.676
        Please, Joseph.         

21:55.915 --> 21:57.882
        You had cancer.

22:14.100 --> 22:16.867
      You're so beautiful.      

22:20.907 --> 22:25.376
   Do you think Margaret will   
 join me for cards later today? 

22:26.846 --> 22:28.946
  I really do miss her laugh.   

22:28.948 --> 22:32.483
           -Margaret?           
             -Yes.

 She's my friend you know that. 
Don't tell me you've forgotten?

      I haven't forgotten       
        about Margaret.

    Once you've recuperated     
   we can talk all about it.

        I'm not hungry.         

27:28.047 --> 27:30.681
        Still gotta eat.        

27:30.683 --> 27:32.650
        It's weird Ray.         

27:32.652 --> 27:34.785
         It's like time         
     has no meaning there.      

27:34.787 --> 27:38.122
Even though she died five years 
    ago, when I found her...    

27:38.124 --> 27:40.090
    it was like she was new     
         to the world.          

27:40.092 --> 27:43.227
 You'd mentioned time anomalies 
      before but why now?       

27:43.229 --> 27:46.397
 Where was Sarah before? What's 
   bringing you together now?   

27:46.399 --> 27:51.435
Maybe I misread the translation 
   and the tattoos limit the    
  spiritual coupling to space.  

27:51.871 --> 27:54.138
   Not like I'm complaining.    

27:54.140 --> 27:57.975
       And it would make        
   for an interesting chapter   
         of your book.          

28:00.446 --> 28:03.714
   Do you know where you guys   
        are on the map?         

28:03.716 --> 28:05.716
             Yeah.              

28:07.253 --> 28:10.854
 As far as I can tell... here.  

28:11.957 --> 28:14.124
         But that means         
       you're heading...        

28:14.126 --> 28:18.195
    Northeast. To the ocean.    

28:18.197 --> 28:21.965
 And that is going to take you  
   precariously close to Hat    
           territory.           

28:21.967 --> 28:23.701
   It's the only way across.    

28:23.703 --> 28:25.903
      And the safest place      
        I found for us.         

28:25.905 --> 28:27.971
            For her.            

28:27.973 --> 28:29.840
     Safest place for her,      
           you mean.            

28:29.842 --> 28:32.409
   Yeah. That's what I said.    

28:37.983 --> 28:41.885
   If you hug the forest line   
   you might be able to slip    
  by without getting noticed.   

28:41.887 --> 28:44.254
   That's what I'm thinking.    

28:44.256 --> 28:48.092
             Okay.              
   You should get some rest.    

28:50.429 --> 28:52.930
    There's something else.     

28:52.932 --> 28:57.267
        -The Grey Lady,         
    she made contact again.     
        -The Grey Lady?         

28:57.269 --> 29:01.171
        -What happened?         
 -She scared the shit out of me 
       is what happened.        

29:01.173 --> 29:04.408
     That's four sightings      
  on the last five trips down.  
You think she has a lock on you?

29:04.410 --> 29:07.177
         I'm not sure.          

29:07.179 --> 29:08.946
             But...             

29:10.449 --> 29:12.783
          What are you          
    not telling me, Joseph?     

29:14.253 --> 29:16.019
      She kinda threw me.       

29:16.021 --> 29:17.921
    You mean she physically     
         affected you?          

29:17.923 --> 29:21.091
 She threw me, across the room. 

29:25.164 --> 29:27.898
 Grey Lady has just always been 
    a nuisance, a bogeyman,     

29:27.900 --> 29:31.335
    but if you're telling me    
     she's becoming more...     

29:31.337 --> 29:33.937
     This is too dangerous,     
            Joseph.             

29:33.939 --> 29:35.372
      Too dangerous, Ray?       

29:35.374 --> 29:37.407
     I've died once a week      
       for the past year.       

29:37.409 --> 29:40.144
  You've administered the last  
  rites to me, what, 50 times?  

29:40.146 --> 29:41.411
     I know what I've done.     

29:41.413 --> 29:44.214
        I found her Ray.        
    That's all that matters.    

29:48.454 --> 29:50.854
      [Ray] And the risk?       

29:54.326 --> 29:56.994
       I made a promise.        

30:34.400 --> 30:36.466

47:15.333 --> 47:16.532
     Just passing through.      

47:16.534 --> 47:18.835
       Really? Where to?        

47:20.138 --> 47:24.207
       Oh. It's a secret.       

47:24.209 --> 47:28.211
        -I Like secrets.        
     That's why I like you.     
         -[door opens]          

47:28.213 --> 47:31.514
    So dark and mysterious.     

47:41.426 --> 47:44.427
     Okay. Thank you Bryl.      

47:46.097 --> 47:49.098
       You really should        
     try this meat, Joseph.     

47:49.100 --> 47:53.936
           So tender.           
       Perfectly cooked.        

47:53.938 --> 47:54.937
        Worth dying for.        

47:54.939 --> 47:56.539
           I'm fine.            

47:56.541 --> 48:01.377
       We haven't talked        
 about your tribute as of yet.  

48:01.379 --> 48:06.182
  I get anything I want here,   
    I routinely have and do.    

48:11.189 --> 48:14.390
    I ask you to not make me    
        do what I will,         

48:14.392 --> 48:17.460
   if you make that request.    

48:17.462 --> 48:20.930
Are you trying to intimidate me?
       Is that a threat?        

48:20.932 --> 48:23.199
         Not a threat.          

48:27.238 --> 48:29.372
    I can see you like her.     

48:31.476 --> 48:33.576
     I rescind my request.      

48:37.916 --> 48:39.415
 Tomorrow you will leave here.  

48:39.417 --> 48:42.685
    You will not come back.     

48:44.155 --> 48:46.088
          Good night.           

48:48.493 --> 48:50.459
          A pleasure.           

49:25.697 --> 49:27.663
You could've been nicer to him. 

49:27.665 --> 49:30.533
 He did let us stay the night.  

49:30.535 --> 49:33.970
 He's a little eccentric, but-- 

49:33.972 --> 49:37.606
   Don't mistake his charisma   
        for compassion.         
      We're not safe here.      

49:37.608 --> 49:42.511
      He took our weapons.      
Our supplies. We're defenceless.

49:42.714 --> 49:47.717
We've been travelling for days. 
 We finally have a decent bed.  

49:50.321 --> 49:53.422
     Is it too much to ask      
 for one night with my husband? 

53:04.649 --> 53:08.784
           [screams]            

53:09.654 --> 53:10.719
            Joseph!             

53:10.721 --> 53:13.389
   My God what are you doing?   

53:16.527 --> 53:18.961
           Dear Lord.           

53:18.963 --> 53:22.865
           [groaning]           

53:22.867 --> 53:26.835
    Joseph! Joseph, it's me!    
    Snap out of it, Joseph!     

53:31.375 --> 53:33.442
              Ray?              

53:40.218 --> 53:42.985
  Ray what's happening to me?   

53:53.497 --> 53:55.464
   I've stopped the bleeding.   

53:55.466 --> 53:59.568
   You'll have a scar but...    
          you'll live.          

54:07.011 --> 54:10.346
 So... What were you thinking?  

54:11.549 --> 54:14.350
            Joseph?             

54:14.352 --> 54:15.951
   I don't remember doing it.   

54:15.953 --> 54:19.021
       You don't remember       
  taking a knife to your face?  

54:20.458 --> 54:23.259
          You're lucky          
   you didn't lose your eye.    

54:24.695 --> 54:27.696
It was the knife I used to carve
    the markings into Sarah.    

54:29.300 --> 54:32.334
      I'm worried, Joseph.      

54:32.336 --> 54:35.671
This isn't right. You can't keep
    doing this to yourself.     

54:35.673 --> 54:38.641
  It's affecting you too much   
   and you're not in control.   

54:38.643 --> 54:41.310
   -I know it appears as if--   
           -Appears?            

54:41.312 --> 54:44.346
 Joseph, you tried to kill me.  

54:46.417 --> 54:51.020
           I'm sorry.           
  I don't know what happened.   

54:51.656 --> 54:55.924
 [sighs] I know you don't want  
   to hear this right now but   
    even you said it before.    

54:56.927 --> 54:59.728
        What if it's all        
       inside your head?        

54:59.730 --> 55:03.399
        When you go dark        
        you're someplace        
    between life and death.     

55:03.401 --> 55:05.734
       What if your brain       
 is filling in all the blanks?  

55:05.736 --> 55:07.503
 After everything you've seen.  

55:07.505 --> 55:09.738
        Heard, from you.        

55:09.740 --> 55:12.007
         Yes, from me.          

55:13.644 --> 55:15.411
    We're in this together.     

55:15.413 --> 55:19.948
    Joseph, how do you know     
           it's real?           

55:23.587 --> 55:25.954
           It's real.           

55:29.527 --> 55:31.093
              Yes?              

55:31.095 --> 55:34.363
-I'm looking for a Mrs. Bennet. 
       -I'm Mrs. Bennet.        

55:34.365 --> 55:38.100
     What if you're wrong?      
      What if we're wrong?      

55:38.102 --> 55:40.536
       What's this about?       

55:40.538 --> 55:44.373
   Mr. Bennet, you don't know   
 me and this is all gonna sound 
        a little weird,         

55:44.375 --> 55:45.874
             but...             

55:47.611 --> 55:51.046
     Does the name Caitlyn      
     mean anything to you?      

55:56.420 --> 55:58.854
         Well, anyhow,          
   I just wanted to tell you    

55:58.856 --> 56:02.624
          that Caitlyn          
        said she's okay.        

56:02.626 --> 56:05.561
      She wanted you both       
         to know that.          

56:09.467 --> 56:11.100
              How?              

56:17.641 --> 56:20.809
    I don't know who you are    
   or what you're doing here.   

56:20.811 --> 56:24.113
 It's taken us this long for us 
 to come to terms with the fact 

56:24.115 --> 56:28.050
 that we aren't having children 
      And now you show up.      

56:28.052 --> 56:32.888
          -I didn't--           
         -We were going         
      to name her Caitlyn.      

56:32.890 --> 56:35.624
         How could you          
      possibly know that?       

56:38.896 --> 56:42.097
      Get off my property       
   before I call the police.    

56:44.668 --> 56:46.568
             Yeah.              

56:53.778 --> 56:57.012
   Do you believe in angels,    
          Mrs. Bennet?          

56:57.014 --> 56:59.948
 Well, your daughter Caitlyn... 

57:00.785 --> 57:02.785
        She's my angel.         

57:05.823 --> 57:08.457
   Let's go inside, sweetie.    

57:13.497 --> 57:15.898
 [Ray] <i> He took with him Peter,</i>  
        <i> James and John</i>         

57:15.900 --> 57:18.867
   and began to be distressed   
         and agitated.          

57:18.869 --> 57:22.538
   And he said to them, "I am   
 deeply grieved, even to death  

57:22.540 --> 57:26.175
          remain here,          
        and keep awake."        

57:26.177 --> 57:28.210
            He came             
    and found them sleeping.    

57:28.212 --> 57:31.580
    "Simon, are you asleep?"    
            he said.            

57:31.816 --> 57:36.718
      "Keep awake and pray      
     that you may not come      
    into the time of trial.     

57:36.720 --> 57:38.487
The spirit is indeed is willing,

57:38.489 --> 57:41.457
    but the flesh is weak."     

57:42.560 --> 57:44.526
    The Gospel of the Lord.     

57:49.533 --> 57:53.669
         In the shadows         
 of the Garden we find a place  
     of unfulfilled dreams,     

57:53.671 --> 57:55.571
      of broken promises.       

57:55.573 --> 57:58.640
    Faced with what he knows    
   will be a horrific death,    

57:58.642 --> 58:01.944
    Jesus asks his apostles     
   the simplest of all tasks,   

58:01.946 --> 58:04.680
     to simply stay awake.      

58:04.682 --> 58:07.916
     Not to help him fight,     
    not to help him escape,     

58:07.918 --> 58:12.788
  but to simply to stay awake   
      and keep him company      
      in his last moments.      

58:14.592 --> 58:17.159
   It's so easy to wage a war   
    on behalf of something,     

58:17.161 --> 58:19.194
     on behalf of an ideal.     

58:19.196 --> 58:23.866
      But to simply stand       
  guard and witness an end...   

58:26.570 --> 58:29.605
           sometimes            
      faithfulness fails.       

58:29.607 --> 58:32.541
  Sometimes the night's cries   
  are far too soothing a song.  

58:32.543 --> 58:36.278
      <i> That their embrace</i>       
   <i> fades away all commitment,</i>  

58:36.280 --> 58:39.648
    <i> and that all the best</i>      
     <i> intentions are lost</i>       
         <i> in a blanket</i>          

58:39.650 --> 58:43.051
     of fear and tiredness.     

58:45.923 --> 58:47.789
          Stay awake.           

58:47.791 --> 58:49.291
   That's all He asks of us.    

58:49.293 --> 58:53.829
  Stay awake and stand watch.   

59:08.779 --> 59:10.913
      Do what you have to,      
        make your peace,        

59:10.915 --> 59:13.649
     'cause after tonight,      
  there's no more going back.

    -This is the last time.     
          -Thank you.

             -Yeah.             

01:00:25.222 --> 01:00:28.290

 Honey, no one leaves the pit.

       What do you want?        

01:17:59.442 --> 01:18:04.178
          You need me.          

01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:06.747
   I need to get out of here.   

01:18:06.749 --> 01:18:10.317
        You're too weak.        

01:18:10.319 --> 01:18:13.854
      But with my help...       

01:18:13.856 --> 01:18:15.356
             Do it.

      decided to show up.

waiting here for a fucking hour.

Ground's heavier than I thought.

01:19:03.005 --> 01:19:05.139
   I leave you alone for five   
    minutes, I swear to God.    

01:19:05.141 --> 01:19:07.308
     You came back for me.      

01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:10.444
    Don't be stupid, Joseph.    
         I never left.

  You gonna stay in that hole   
    all day or are we going     
     to fuck some shit up?

     being a little bitch?

        as time goes on.

     That's it. It's ready.

      Hey, Joe, be honest.      
Does this bomb make me look fat?

   You don't have to do this,   
     you know that, right?      

01:20:44.874 --> 01:20:47.441
 I see the way you look at her. 

01:20:47.443 --> 01:20:51.312
  I want someone to look at me  
       that way one day.

  And besides, you said energy  
   can't be destroyed, right?

01:26:21.944 --> 01:26:24.678
  You're a persistent fucker,   
          aren't you?

  [labored breathing] Joseph!   

01:26:28.217 --> 01:26:31.385
      Your wife and I had       
        some quiet time.        

01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:36.690
       And she let me in        
        on a few things         
 while you were six feet under. 

01:26:36.692 --> 01:26:40.394

   Wherever the hell we are,

 That is a fact that you know,  
          she knows...

          and I know.

        In all honesty,         
   I thought you'd be taller.   

01:28:14.056 --> 01:28:18.592

    alone. I'm warning you.

        threatening me?

     I see why you wear it.     

01:28:30.673 --> 01:28:32.439
      You should probably       
        put it back on.

        for both of us.         

01:31:56.211 --> 01:31:57.844
            Sarah...            

01:31:57.846 --> 01:31:59.012
        Live your life.         

01:32:04.253 --> 01:32:05.986
        You are my life.        

01:32:05.988 --> 01:32:08.822
            [gasps]             

01:32:08.824 --> 01:32:12.726
      [shallow breathing]       

01:32:37.719 --> 01:32:38.985
    [Joseph] <i> Why am I here?</i>     

01:32:38.987 --> 01:32:41.588
          Mr. Morgan,           

01:32:42.591 --> 01:32:44.891
     you murdered a priest.     

01:32:45.661 --> 01:32:50.030
  You exhumed your wife's body  
       and carved symbols       
         in her flesh.          

01:32:51.166 --> 01:32:53.733
    Where else do you think     
         you should be?         

01:33:02.711 --> 01:33:07.647
    Says here they have you     
     on Haloperidol shots.      
      Pretty strong stuff.      

01:33:07.649 --> 01:33:10.050
          They're for           
       my hallucinations.       

01:33:10.052 --> 01:33:12.586
          We both know          
  they're not hallucinations.   

01:33:13.789 --> 01:33:15.822
         Are you lost?          

01:33:19.728 --> 01:33:22.829
         I don't know.          

01:33:22.831 --> 01:33:25.765
      I think I'm looking       
          for someone.          

01:33:25.767 --> 01:33:29.102
      Everyone is looking       
       for someone here.        

01:33:29.104 --> 01:33:31.671
      We can look together      
          if you want.          

01:33:31.673 --> 01:33:37.010
   <i> I know you lost your son,</i>   
     <i> and then your wife.</i>       

01:33:37.012 --> 01:33:39.746
       <i> I know how hard</i>         
         <i> that can be.</i>          

01:33:39.748 --> 01:33:42.382
   <i> The places it takes you...</i>  

01:33:45.153 --> 01:33:47.854
      I lost my daughter.       

01:33:48.757 --> 01:33:50.690
           I'm Sarah.           

01:33:54.863 --> 01:33:57.631
   I don't remember my name.    

01:33:59.768 --> 01:34:04.004
      It'll all come back.      
           I promise.           

01:34:04.006 --> 01:34:07.240
    I know what you've done,    
          Mr. Morgan,           

01:34:07.242 --> 01:34:09.776
   what you've accomplished.    

01:34:12.014 --> 01:34:14.781
       Will you help me?        

01:34:16.218 --> 01:34:18.251
          Where am I?           

01:34:18.253 --> 01:34:21.121
     We should get moving.      

01:34:21.123 --> 01:34:23.390
   We have a long way to go.    

01:34:23.392 --> 01:34:26.192
       And we don't want        
   to be travelling at night.   

01:34:36.972 --> 01:34:39.272
  [Joseph] <i> What do you dream?</i>   

01:34:39.274 --> 01:34:41.975
 [Sarah] There's a horseman...  

01:34:43.045 --> 01:34:44.778
   <i> and the sun is setting.</i>     

01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:46.846
       And he's all alone       

01:34:46.848 --> 01:34:49.282
  <i> with the world on his back.</i>  

01:34:49.284 --> 01:34:52.952
       <i> And I just want</i>         
       <i> to say to him...</i>        

01:34:52.954 --> 01:34:56.122
       <i> Don't be afraid</i>         
      <i> of what's to come.</i>       

01:34:56.124 --> 01:34:59.225
       <i> Don't be afraid</i>         
       <i> of the darkness.</i>        

01:35:00.696 --> 01:35:02.829
      That there is light.      

01:35:07.836 --> 01:35:10.070
        There is light.         

01:36:47.536 --> 01:36:50.370
 <i> ¶ The star light shines down ¶</i>

01:36:50.372 --> 01:36:53.072
   <i> ¶ Like angels falling ¶</i>     

01:36:53.074 --> 01:36:55.942
   <i> ¶ To feel what you feel ¶</i>   

01:36:55.944 --> 01:36:58.411
  <i> ¶ They be still their call ¶</i> 

01:36:58.413 --> 01:37:04.017
     <i> ¶ All fall to kneel</i>       
         <i> before her ¶</i>          

01:37:04.019 --> 01:37:09.422
     <i> ¶ All fall to kneel</i>       
         <i> before her ¶</i>          

01:37:09.424 --> 01:37:12.358
 <i> ¶ Before her there was dark ¶</i> 

01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:15.061
 <i> ¶ Before her there was night ¶</i>

01:37:15.063 --> 01:37:18.198
    <i> ¶ And with her comes ¶</i>     

01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:22.135
        <i> ¶ The light ¶</i>          

01:37:23.071 --> 01:37:25.905
   <i> ¶ In the garden of tears ¶</i>  

01:37:25.907 --> 01:37:28.875
       <i> ¶ We have bored</i>         
     <i> through your fears ¶</i>      

01:37:28.877 --> 01:37:31.277
 <i> ¶ Before her there was dark ¶</i> 

01:37:31.279 --> 01:37:34.480
        <i> ¶ And with her</i>         
      <i> comes the light ¶</i>        

01:37:34.482 --> 01:37:37.183
   <i> ¶ And night's sweet song ¶</i>  

01:37:37.185 --> 01:37:40.053
   <i> ¶ The cries, they go on ¶</i>   

01:37:40.055 --> 01:37:42.555
   <i> ¶ With love's last taste ¶</i>  

01:37:42.557 --> 01:37:45.592
   <i> ¶ We wait for the dawn ¶</i>    

01:37:45.594 --> 01:37:51.064
 <i> ¶ I fall to kneel before you ¶</i>

01:37:51.066 --> 01:37:56.269
 <i> ¶ I fall to kneel before you ¶</i>

01:37:56.271 --> 01:37:59.239
 <i> ¶ Before you, there was dark ¶</i>

01:37:59.241 --> 01:38:02.075
<i>¶ Before you, there was night ¶</i> 

01:38:02.077 --> 01:38:05.011
    <i> ¶ And with you comes ¶</i>     

01:38:05.013 --> 01:38:10.016
        <i> ¶ The light ¶</i>          

01:38:10.018 --> 01:38:12.619
      <i> ¶ The light tires</i>        
        <i> in the night ¶</i>         

01:38:12.621 --> 01:38:15.955
       <i> ¶ When love dies</i>        
      <i> the light cries ¶</i>        

01:38:15.957 --> 01:38:18.057
        <i> ¶ To live on ¶</i>         

01:38:18.059 --> 01:38:21.060
         <i> ¶ Live on ¶</i>

         <i> ¶ Live on ¶</i>           

01:38:42.317 --> 01:38:48.087
   <i> ¶ But it's hard to go on ¶</i>  

01:38:50.025 --> 01:38:55.461
     <i> ¶ Oh man of night ¶</i>       

01:38:55.463 --> 01:39:00.466
      ¶ You're searching ¶      

01:39:00.468 --> 01:39:04.938
