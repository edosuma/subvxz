WEBVTT

00:00.534 --> 00:03.771
[music playing]

00:08.376 --> 00:11.279
All right, Mrs. Conner, I
finished mopping the bathroom.

00:11.312 --> 00:13.081
[sigh],, Well, I'd
check your work,

00:13.114 --> 00:16.084
but I don't feel like moving.

00:16.117 --> 00:17.185
I'll tell you what.

00:17.218 --> 00:23.023
Why don't you just clean
from here to there.

00:23.057 --> 00:24.325
Where are you pointing?

00:24.358 --> 00:25.159
The horizon.

00:28.562 --> 00:30.164
Come on, Mrs.
Conner, ever since you

00:30.198 --> 00:32.633
caught me at Darlene's, you've
been working me like a dog.

00:32.666 --> 00:34.435
And the beauty of
being a working dog

00:34.468 --> 00:38.038
is that you don't
get put to sleep.

00:38.072 --> 00:41.109
You know, all this punishment
isn't teaching me a thing.

00:41.142 --> 00:42.476
Oh, really?

00:42.510 --> 00:44.044
Well, maybe you
could learn a lesson

00:44.078 --> 00:46.247
if I would tell the
big, strong, fiercely

00:46.280 --> 00:49.250
protective Mr.
Conner that you were

00:49.283 --> 00:51.285
shacking up with his daughter.

00:51.319 --> 00:52.153
[door close]

00:55.089 --> 00:56.624
Hey.

00:56.657 --> 01:01.929
Hey, how's my big, strong,
fiercely protective husband?

01:01.962 --> 01:03.397
Exhausted.

01:03.431 --> 01:06.834
But, you'd still
kill for me, right?

01:06.867 --> 01:08.068
Yeah, sure.
Why not?

01:08.102 --> 01:09.803
[can open]

01:09.837 --> 01:10.704
Scrub brush.

01:10.738 --> 01:13.374
I'll start here.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.543
David, this new obsession
of yours with housework

01:15.576 --> 01:17.678
concerns me.

01:17.711 --> 01:20.681
Mrs. Conner has always
said that a clean house

01:20.714 --> 01:23.117
is the devil's playground.

01:23.151 --> 01:24.418
Yes, that's true.

01:24.452 --> 01:26.720
But David feels--
and I must agree--

01:26.754 --> 01:29.089
that cleaning is the
least he can do for us,

01:29.123 --> 01:32.260
after us taking him back, after
running away to live with--

01:32.293 --> 01:34.662
My mom.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.330
Well, in-- in
Michigan, you remember?

01:39.567 --> 01:41.702
Hey.

01:41.735 --> 01:43.537
I know you probably had
to do this kind of stuff

01:43.571 --> 01:44.905
to make your mom
happy, but there's

01:44.938 --> 01:46.140
nobody here to be scared of.

01:50.711 --> 01:51.745
Take the rest of the day off.

01:56.184 --> 01:59.052
David!

01:59.086 --> 02:00.754
When you clean out
the refrigerator,

02:00.788 --> 02:03.491
don't throw away the moldy buns.

02:03.524 --> 02:05.326
DJ thinks it's chia bread.

02:10.431 --> 02:11.432
You heard Mr. Conner.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.601
He said, take the
rest of the day off.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.803
Well, isn't that funny?

02:15.836 --> 02:19.006
I thought he said, if
anybody has been messing

02:19.039 --> 02:21.108
around with my
daughter, I'm going

02:21.141 --> 02:23.177
to crush him like a beer can.

02:26.747 --> 02:27.915
David, I'm done with this page.

02:39.760 --> 02:44.164
[theme music]

03:24.104 --> 03:28.476
[music playing]

03:30.678 --> 03:35.516
Hey, Becky, tell Mark thanks
for fixing that blender for me.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.150
Boy, I should have
known that he'd

03:37.184 --> 03:38.819
know right what to do,
you know, since it's

03:38.852 --> 03:41.255
like a miniature truck motor.

03:41.289 --> 03:44.191
Oh, well, it was no problem
for him, seeing as he's

03:44.224 --> 03:46.294
a really, really good mechanic.

03:46.327 --> 03:47.461
Right, dad?

03:47.495 --> 03:48.462
Yeah.

03:48.496 --> 03:52.132
The list goes me,
Mark, Goober Pyle.

03:52.165 --> 03:55.068
Oh, well, I'm glad to hear
that, because mom said you have

03:55.102 --> 03:57.271
an opening down at the
garage, and that Mark

03:57.305 --> 03:58.872
could probably get it.

03:58.906 --> 04:01.309
Is that true?

04:01.342 --> 04:03.076
(ANGRY WHISPER) Why
did you tell her that?

04:03.110 --> 04:05.746
Well, we as, you know,
sitting around, talking

04:05.779 --> 04:07.315
about trucks and garages.

04:07.348 --> 04:08.282
You know, girl talk.

04:08.316 --> 04:10.451
And it just came up.

04:10.484 --> 04:12.853
Is it true?

04:12.886 --> 04:14.688
It's true.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.624
Except for the part about
Mark getting the job.

04:16.657 --> 04:17.758
Sorry, no.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.159
Well, why not, Dan?

04:19.192 --> 04:20.260
You used to work with him.

04:20.294 --> 04:21.929
You think he's a good mechanic.

04:21.962 --> 04:24.298
Look, most guys work
for the city a year

04:24.332 --> 04:26.400
before they start hiring
all their relatives.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.168
It won't look right
if I jump the gun.

04:28.201 --> 04:30.738
Oh, fine, then we'll
never have any money,

04:30.771 --> 04:32.205
and we'll just
live here forever.

04:32.239 --> 04:34.642
You can put away your
own damn groceries, dad!

04:37.311 --> 04:39.780
Thanks for turning my
daughter against me, Roseanne.

04:39.813 --> 04:42.816
Well, actually, I had you
all set up to be the big hero.

04:42.850 --> 04:45.919
But you had to spoil it
with that "no" business.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.054
It would have
been nice for you

04:47.087 --> 04:49.022
to run this little idea
by me before telling it

04:49.056 --> 04:50.290
to Mark and Becky.

04:50.324 --> 04:53.427
Dan, have you never heard
of the element of surprise?

04:53.461 --> 04:56.229
From now on, I want to know
what's going on in this house

04:56.263 --> 04:58.298
before it blows up in my face.

04:58.332 --> 05:00.200
No more secrets, understood?

05:00.233 --> 05:02.503
Mrs. Conner, I'm going to
attack that mildew problem now.

05:08.976 --> 05:13.180
Well David, Mr. Conner
says that we are not to have

05:13.213 --> 05:16.517
any more secrets in this house.

05:16.550 --> 05:19.152
Really?

05:19.186 --> 05:21.555
I'm afraid so.

05:21.589 --> 05:27.461
Dan, [deep breath] [sigh]
we have a mildew problem.

05:27.495 --> 05:31.365
[music playing]

05:34.435 --> 05:35.436
Is Jackie around?

05:35.469 --> 05:36.737
[door close]
- Yeah.

05:36.770 --> 05:37.905
She must be out in the back.

05:37.938 --> 05:38.972
You got the goods?

05:46.146 --> 05:48.482
I'm sick of having to
trick Jackie like this.

05:48.516 --> 05:50.551
I shouldn't have to
support my baby by sneaking

05:50.584 --> 05:52.219
money into a tip jar.

05:52.252 --> 05:55.889
Well, I told you, if you write a
check, she's going to catch on.

05:55.923 --> 05:56.824
Hey, Jackie.

05:56.857 --> 05:57.725
Fred.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.159
How you feeling today?

05:59.192 --> 06:00.360
Lovely, Fred.

06:00.394 --> 06:02.029
If I could do a back
bend, I'd be a camel.

06:07.835 --> 06:09.603
Wow, look at all my tips.

06:09.637 --> 06:12.105
Um, no, those
are Jackie's tips.

06:12.139 --> 06:13.240
No, they're not.

06:13.273 --> 06:16.744
She got nauseous, and
I took over her table.

06:16.777 --> 06:21.381
I knew this push-up bra would
bring in the extra dough.

06:21.415 --> 06:24.685
No, this guy came
in yesterday and says,

06:24.718 --> 06:27.287
he forgot to tip the waitress
with the real breasts.

06:30.157 --> 06:33.661
So $15 of that is Jackie's.

06:33.694 --> 06:35.195
Ahem, $20.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.029
[cough]

06:37.898 --> 06:39.933
Remember, Nancy?

06:39.967 --> 06:42.970
Oh, right, that
guy from yesterday.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.237
OK.

06:44.271 --> 06:46.640
Oh, you-- oh, the
man with the glasses,

06:46.674 --> 06:48.676
who kept drinking coffee?

06:48.709 --> 06:49.810
Uh, yeah, yeah.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.111
Yeah, he really liked you.

06:51.144 --> 06:53.380
There was no man.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.916
Where's this
money coming from?

06:55.949 --> 06:57.651
You don't have any money.

06:57.685 --> 06:59.019
And you don't know
what's going on.

07:02.656 --> 07:03.857
Dammit, Fred.

07:03.891 --> 07:06.093
Well, you wouldn't take
any money directly from me,

07:06.126 --> 07:10.464
so Roseanne's been
putting it in the tip jar.

07:10.498 --> 07:11.364
Well, not all of it.

07:11.398 --> 07:12.399
I took some.

07:12.432 --> 07:17.471
I mean-- You have
your pride, Jackie.

07:17.505 --> 07:19.673
Look, Fred, it's not your baby.

07:19.707 --> 07:20.641
It's mine.

07:20.674 --> 07:22.142
What makes you think
you have any say

07:22.175 --> 07:23.844
in how I raise my child?

07:23.877 --> 07:25.779
I just want to be
involved with this baby.

07:25.813 --> 07:26.980
Why can't you let me help?

07:27.014 --> 07:27.881
You want to help!

07:27.915 --> 07:29.883
Quit pressuring me.

07:29.917 --> 07:30.884
Quit trying to butt in.

07:30.918 --> 07:31.919
Just leave me the hell alone.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.053
God, Jackie.

07:33.086 --> 07:35.055
Well, how many times
do I have to tell him?

07:35.088 --> 07:36.356
[smack]

07:36.389 --> 07:37.357
I think that will be the last.

07:39.827 --> 07:40.628
[bang]

07:41.629 --> 07:42.663
[bang]

07:42.696 --> 07:44.898
Well that was really stupid.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.099
No, it wasn't.

07:46.133 --> 07:49.202
As far as I'm concerned,
kids grow up fine as long

07:49.236 --> 07:50.871
as they have one decent parent.

07:50.904 --> 07:57.144
Oh, man, would you please stop
quoting that "Murphy Brown?"

07:57.177 --> 08:00.948
[music playing]

08:03.450 --> 08:05.986
I want to go over to
Easy Miller's house.

08:06.019 --> 08:07.888
No, not till you
clean your room.

08:07.921 --> 08:10.390
Well, you wouldn't want me
tell dad about what's going

08:10.423 --> 08:11.625
on around here, would you?

08:14.461 --> 08:17.364
Oh, no, DJ.

08:17.397 --> 08:19.533
Now that you have all
of this information,

08:19.567 --> 08:23.003
you have all the power,
and I have nothing.

08:23.036 --> 08:26.840
I guess you'll be ruling the
roost around here from now on.

08:26.874 --> 08:30.277
Whatever, will I do?

08:30.310 --> 08:33.614
All right, I'll clean my room.

08:33.647 --> 08:34.514
[door close]

08:35.515 --> 08:36.416
Hey, Rosie.

08:36.449 --> 08:38.085
Hey, David.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.186
How's my favorite almost son?

08:39.219 --> 08:40.020
Mm.

08:43.557 --> 08:44.725
I can't take this.

08:44.758 --> 08:45.593
Oh, what?

08:45.626 --> 08:47.060
He barely touched you.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.295
I got to tell him.

08:48.328 --> 08:51.098
Mrs. Conner, we all live
our lives by certain rules.

08:51.131 --> 08:53.233
And I like to believe that
nothing bad can happen to me

08:53.266 --> 08:54.534
as long as I tell the truth.

08:54.568 --> 08:59.072
Oh, my god, how did
your mother raise you?

08:59.106 --> 09:00.473
David!

09:00.507 --> 09:01.374
Hey, Mr. Conner.

09:01.408 --> 09:02.876
David, can't
you see Mr. Conner

09:02.910 --> 09:04.912
is busy watching the news.

09:04.945 --> 09:07.314
Can I talk to you?

09:07.347 --> 09:08.248
Just a sec.

09:12.052 --> 09:15.723
David, um, that's our
best China soaking in there.

09:15.756 --> 09:20.460
And if it soaked too long,
the pattern will come off.

09:20.493 --> 09:22.796
I'm sorry, Mrs. Conner,
I have to do this.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.832
Mr. Conner, you don't know
this, but I was in Chicago.

09:24.865 --> 09:25.799
Oh!

09:25.833 --> 09:27.367
And, eh-- and we
went to a Cubs game.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.169
And it was the most
boring story I've ever

09:29.202 --> 09:30.303
heard, blah, blah, blah, blah.

09:30.337 --> 09:31.271
Go do the dishes, David.

09:31.304 --> 09:32.105
No.

09:36.443 --> 09:40.380
Mr. Conner, when I was gone,
I wasn't living with my mom.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.481
I was living with Darlene.

09:41.514 --> 09:42.816
It was a stupid thing to do.

09:42.850 --> 09:43.651
And I'm sorry.

09:47.154 --> 09:47.955
Very sorry.

09:50.791 --> 09:54.127
Oh, god, I'm sorry.

09:54.161 --> 09:56.664
You lying little bastard!

09:56.697 --> 09:58.498
You got 20 minutes
to pack up your crap

09:58.531 --> 09:59.700
and get out of my house.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.635
Mrs. Conner will drive
you to the bus station.

10:01.669 --> 10:02.703
I don't want to look at you.

10:09.643 --> 10:11.111
God!

10:11.144 --> 10:12.946
Do you believe this, Roseanne?

10:12.980 --> 10:13.881
No.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.548
I was stunned when
I first heard.

10:15.582 --> 10:17.885
What do you mean,
when you first heard?

10:17.918 --> 10:20.287
You know, just now.

10:20.320 --> 10:24.591
And, oh, man, now
I'm kind of in shock.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.026
Take a kid into
your house, and this

10:26.059 --> 10:29.429
is how he pays you back?

10:29.462 --> 10:30.563
I bet I know why
he's been doing

10:30.597 --> 10:31.965
all those chores around here.

10:31.999 --> 10:33.300
He's got a guilty conscience.

10:35.903 --> 10:37.805
I never want to
see that kid again.

10:37.838 --> 10:38.772
Damn!

10:38.806 --> 10:39.673
[boom]

10:39.707 --> 10:40.708
[clattering sound]

10:42.275 --> 10:45.813
Great, he wrecks the place
right after he fires my maid.

10:45.846 --> 10:49.616
[music playing]

10:57.925 --> 10:59.592
You want any help
with that crib?

10:59.626 --> 11:01.795
Oh, yeah, right, like
you came all the way down

11:01.829 --> 11:02.996
here to talk about this crib.

11:03.030 --> 11:05.365
This is so obvious.

11:05.398 --> 11:10.103
Crib, baby, Fred, you
want to talk about Fred.

11:10.137 --> 11:11.972
No, I don't want
to talk about Fred.

11:12.005 --> 11:12.973
See?

11:13.006 --> 11:14.441
There, you just
brought him up again.

11:14.474 --> 11:15.375
Well, what can I say?

11:15.408 --> 11:16.476
I'm obsessed.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.478
Look, I don't feel
bad about what happened.

11:18.511 --> 11:19.379
It's better now.

11:19.412 --> 11:20.547
He knows where he stands.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.615
And that's that.

11:22.649 --> 11:25.052
You know I got bigger problems
to talk to you about than

11:25.085 --> 11:27.721
whether or not
you made Fred cry.

11:27.755 --> 11:29.923
I made Fred cry?

11:29.957 --> 11:32.192
Let's not talk about him.

11:32.225 --> 11:33.093
Fred is a grownup.

11:33.126 --> 11:34.227
He can take care of himself.

11:34.261 --> 11:38.431
He's not some teenager,
like poor David.

11:38.465 --> 11:39.332
Why?

11:39.366 --> 11:41.134
What happened to David?

11:41.168 --> 11:43.403
Dan found out he was living
with Darlene in Chicago,

11:43.436 --> 11:44.604
and he kicked him
out of the house.

11:44.637 --> 11:45.638
Oh, my god.

11:45.672 --> 11:46.807
Where is he now?

11:46.840 --> 11:47.941
I don't know.

11:47.975 --> 11:51.611
He could be anywhere,
living on the streets,

11:51.644 --> 11:57.417
eating out of a dumpster,
standing in your hall.

11:57.450 --> 11:59.719
Roseanne, no.

11:59.753 --> 12:01.254
He cannot stay here.

12:01.288 --> 12:02.823
I can't deal with that now.

12:02.856 --> 12:05.525
Please, just tell
David I'm sorry.

12:05.558 --> 12:06.526
I can't do that, Jackie.

12:06.559 --> 12:07.961
It would just crush him.
You tell him.

12:07.995 --> 12:08.796
David!

12:11.464 --> 12:12.732
Hey, Jackie.

12:12.766 --> 12:16.503
Hi, David.

12:16.536 --> 12:17.704
You don't want
me to stay, huh?

12:17.737 --> 12:19.272
It's not that I
don't want you living

12:19.306 --> 12:20.607
here, David, because I do.

12:20.640 --> 12:23.410
It's just that I'm not even
allowed to have a cat here,

12:23.443 --> 12:26.113
let alone a boy.

12:26.146 --> 12:28.015
Jackie, you own this house.

12:28.048 --> 12:29.682
I know that.

12:29.716 --> 12:30.583
These are my rules.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.123
Anyway, it's all right.

12:36.156 --> 12:38.425
Look, Mrs. Conner, I really
think I should just get

12:38.458 --> 12:39.726
on the bus back to my mom's.

12:47.500 --> 12:52.139
Ugh, god, how many-- how
long would he have to stay?

12:52.172 --> 12:53.073
Not too long at all.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.207
Uh, I think it
would only take me

12:54.241 --> 12:55.575
a couple of days
to make, you know,

12:55.608 --> 12:59.012
Dan feel guilty enough
to take him back,

12:59.046 --> 13:02.382
two years at the most.

13:02.415 --> 13:05.552
We're just pretending like
I have a choice here, right?

13:05.585 --> 13:07.220
Right.

13:07.254 --> 13:08.388
All right, David,
get your stuff.

13:08.421 --> 13:10.991
You can sleep here.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.492
Ah, I knew it.

13:12.525 --> 13:13.927
I knew it.

13:13.961 --> 13:16.429
I knew that, if I
brought him over here,

13:16.463 --> 13:18.431
and you saw his little
puppy dog face, that you

13:18.465 --> 13:19.499
could not turn him away.

13:19.532 --> 13:21.935
Well I guess you
know me pretty well.

13:21.969 --> 13:24.371
Got another surprise for you.

13:24.404 --> 13:27.975
Fred, come here!

13:28.008 --> 13:28.909
Made you look.

13:28.942 --> 13:29.776
Made you look.

13:29.809 --> 13:30.677
Made you--

13:30.710 --> 13:34.681
[music playing]

13:38.618 --> 13:39.819
I finished putting
the crib together.

13:42.722 --> 13:44.791
So, I'll get started on
the stroller tomorrow.

13:47.827 --> 13:51.331
So, goodnight.

13:51.364 --> 13:56.836
David, do you think
of me as a mean person?

13:56.870 --> 13:58.005
You?
No.

13:58.038 --> 13:59.272
No way.

13:59.306 --> 14:00.740
I mean, you're letting me
stay here and everything.

14:00.773 --> 14:03.343
I think you're really nice.

14:03.376 --> 14:05.645
Well, you're wrong.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.982
I'm a horrible, horrible woman--

14:09.016 --> 14:11.384
the worst.

14:11.418 --> 14:14.254
I don't even think
I have a heart.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.789
I'm like the Tin Man,
all hollow inside.

14:19.626 --> 14:21.128
See, I'm not sure what to say.

14:21.161 --> 14:22.930
Usually, when Darlene
says something like that,

14:22.963 --> 14:23.763
it's a trick.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.037
It's been three days, David.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.371
Fred hasn't come by the diner.

14:31.404 --> 14:32.372
He hasn't called.

14:32.405 --> 14:35.375
I wanted him gone
but not like this.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.677
He's probably sitting
at home crying still.

14:37.710 --> 14:38.578
No.

14:38.611 --> 14:39.779
No.

14:39.812 --> 14:41.148
It's different for guys.

14:41.181 --> 14:44.784
I mean, Darlene used to say
mean stuff to me all the time,

14:44.817 --> 14:47.387
and I never took it
personally or anything.

14:47.420 --> 14:48.288
Really?

14:48.321 --> 14:49.422
Yeah.

14:49.456 --> 14:51.824
And now that we broke
up, it's a good thing.

14:51.858 --> 14:53.860
You know, I mean, I'm
even starting to think

14:53.893 --> 14:56.329
about seeing other people.

14:56.363 --> 14:57.530
You are?

14:57.564 --> 14:58.798
Yeah.

14:58.831 --> 15:02.435
In fact, I've got a couple
of girls lined up already.

15:02.469 --> 15:05.038
Oh, well, aheh
hm, that's good.

15:05.072 --> 15:05.872
Heh heh.

15:08.775 --> 15:10.010
That makes me feel a lot better.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.511
Aheh heh.

15:11.544 --> 15:14.114
Yeah, I'm doing much better now.

15:14.147 --> 15:16.016
You're-- you're starting
to see other people.

15:16.049 --> 15:18.818
And Fred's a swinging single.

15:18.851 --> 15:20.453
And look at me.

15:20.487 --> 15:25.625
And I'm just a wall,
aheh heh, a wall of baby.

15:25.658 --> 15:26.994
Who could love this?

15:27.027 --> 15:29.096
Oh, come on, lots of people.

15:29.129 --> 15:30.830
Yeah, right.

15:30.863 --> 15:33.466
I mean, sure, you're--
you're-- you're big and all,

15:33.500 --> 15:39.172
but that doesn't
mean you're not still

15:39.206 --> 15:43.710
great to be around and really
funny and just beautiful.

15:43.743 --> 15:46.146
[sigh] You mean that?

15:46.179 --> 15:47.114
I do, honest.

15:47.147 --> 15:51.084
Tch, oh, David,
[sniff] look at you.

15:51.118 --> 15:53.320
You broke up with
your girlfriend.

15:53.353 --> 15:54.621
And Dan kicked you
out of the house.

15:54.654 --> 15:57.424
And you're trying
to cheer me up.

15:57.457 --> 15:58.992
[sniff] You're really special.

16:03.696 --> 16:04.931
I don't think we
should be doing this.

16:14.007 --> 16:14.974
What?

16:15.008 --> 16:16.776
I mean, don't get me wrong.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.545
It's not that I'm
not attracted to you.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.080
I-- I am.

16:20.113 --> 16:22.982
But I'm still really
confused about Darlene.

16:23.016 --> 16:25.718
And I think it would just
kind of be a mistake if we--

16:25.752 --> 16:27.620
you know?

16:27.654 --> 16:28.455
What?

16:31.258 --> 16:32.692
Oh, god.

16:32.725 --> 16:35.495
You and me, are
you serious, David?

16:35.528 --> 16:37.264
Oh, my god.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.032
You're just a little child.

16:39.066 --> 16:43.570
[laughs] Oh, god, that hurts.

16:43.603 --> 16:50.510
[laughs] Oh, David, thank you.
Thank you.

16:50.543 --> 16:53.546
You really know how to pick a
girl up out of the doldrums.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.448
That was so good.

16:55.482 --> 16:57.350
[laughs]

16:57.384 --> 16:58.985
I thought you'd like that.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.388
[laughs]

17:02.455 --> 17:06.759
[music playing]

17:09.796 --> 17:11.164
[door close]

17:11.198 --> 17:12.365
Sorry I'm late.

17:12.399 --> 17:13.733
I stopped at the market
to pick up some groceries.

17:13.766 --> 17:16.703
I got ice cream, cookies, candy.

17:16.736 --> 17:20.140
Dan, did it ever occur to you
that we shop like our parents

17:20.173 --> 17:21.040
are gone for the weekend?

17:24.844 --> 17:27.980
Well, I still haven't
heard a thing from David.

17:28.014 --> 17:30.183
Geez, tell a guy to get the
hell out and never come back,

17:30.217 --> 17:32.051
and this is how he treats you.

17:32.085 --> 17:33.953
Well, I know you did
the right thing, Dan.

17:33.986 --> 17:35.922
I'm just glad that you were
the one that made the decision.

17:35.955 --> 17:39.159
I-- I just never could live
with myself after I heard

17:39.192 --> 17:40.727
the stuff his mom says to him.

17:40.760 --> 17:43.996
- Roseanne, we had no choice.
- Yeah, I know that.

17:44.030 --> 17:45.832
I'm just saying that I
couldn't have done it.

17:45.865 --> 17:46.733
He's a big kid.

17:46.766 --> 17:47.934
He can take care of himself.

17:47.967 --> 17:50.270
Now, I don't want to hear
another word about it.

17:50.303 --> 17:52.172
Fine, I-- I won't
bring him up again.

17:54.774 --> 17:55.642
David!

17:55.675 --> 17:57.043
I mean, dinner!

18:01.047 --> 18:01.948
Need any help, mom?

18:01.981 --> 18:03.283
Oh, no, let me do it.

18:03.316 --> 18:05.017
You've been serving
people all day.

18:05.051 --> 18:06.719
I've only been doing
it for 25 years.

18:12.292 --> 18:13.193
[sigh]

18:14.294 --> 18:18.064
Gee, I miss David.

18:18.097 --> 18:21.334
Well, DJ, your father and
I have made a decision now.

18:21.368 --> 18:23.002
And we are going
to stick with it.

18:23.035 --> 18:25.104
David did a very bad thing.

18:25.138 --> 18:27.474
And we do not need
anybody second

18:27.507 --> 18:31.478
guessing the extreme
severity of his punishment.

18:31.511 --> 18:34.113
If I do something
really bad, does that mean

18:34.147 --> 18:35.748
you'll get rid of me, too?

18:40.720 --> 18:42.989
DJ, is that the message
we're sending you?

18:49.362 --> 18:50.230
What's the matter?

18:50.263 --> 18:51.130
I don't know.

18:51.164 --> 18:53.800
I just don't feel like eating.

18:53.833 --> 18:54.667
[sigh]

18:57.704 --> 18:59.806
Don't tell me you're
starting to feel guilty?

18:59.839 --> 19:01.007
No, Roseanne, I'm not.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.475
I'm just not hungry, OK?

19:02.509 --> 19:04.377
Well, god, Dan,
don't be so defensive!

19:04.411 --> 19:07.814
I said if you're feeling
guilty, then there is still

19:07.847 --> 19:09.115
time to do something about it!

19:12.385 --> 19:14.153
Yeah, you're right.

19:14.187 --> 19:15.322
Of course, I'm right, Dan.

19:15.355 --> 19:16.723
Don't you know who I am?

19:20.360 --> 19:21.861
Mark, if you're still
interested in that job

19:21.894 --> 19:23.062
at the garage, it's yours.

19:23.095 --> 19:24.431
- What?
- What?

19:24.464 --> 19:25.632
Are you-- are you serious, Dan?

19:25.665 --> 19:27.334
Yeah, I figure it will
be OK as long as you don't

19:27.367 --> 19:28.301
ask for any special favors.

19:28.335 --> 19:29.602
And you start tomorrow.

19:29.636 --> 19:33.206
[sigh] Eh, come in
about noon, one o'clock,

19:33.240 --> 19:34.807
whenever you feel like it.

19:34.841 --> 19:35.808
Thanks, dad.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.910
[sigh] Hey, huh?

19:37.944 --> 19:39.979
I feel better already.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.514
Well the guilt
thing really worked.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.250
Thanks, Mrs. Conner.

19:43.283 --> 19:47.354
Yeah, I really know how to
make things happen around here.

19:47.387 --> 19:50.056
Every time I look at
David's empty chair,

19:50.089 --> 19:51.424
it feels like our whole--

19:51.458 --> 19:54.861
Ah, can it!

19:54.894 --> 19:58.731
[music playing]

20:23.990 --> 20:25.325
Miss Harris,
what are you doing?

20:37.937 --> 20:38.738
Have you got a light?

20:41.808 --> 20:44.811
No.
Huh.

20:44.844 --> 20:48.147
David, what do
you think of me?

20:48.180 --> 20:49.416
What do you mean?

20:49.449 --> 20:51.083
Well, you've known me
for quite a few years now.

20:51.117 --> 20:55.322
You must have formed
some opinion of me.

20:55.355 --> 20:58.358
Well, I think you're
a very nice person.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.629
Do you find me desirable?

21:05.365 --> 21:06.799
Sure.

21:06.833 --> 21:08.200
I think you're the
most attractive

21:08.234 --> 21:09.201
of all Darlene's aunts.

21:11.904 --> 21:13.440
What are you
drinking, bourbon?

21:16.776 --> 21:18.311
Miss Harris, you're
trying to seduce me.

21:18.345 --> 21:21.548
[laughs]

21:25.418 --> 21:26.919
Aren't you?

21:26.953 --> 21:29.589
God, David, we've been
through this before.

21:29.622 --> 21:30.657
You're just a child.

21:33.726 --> 21:37.063
[music playing]

21:53.179 --> 21:56.248
[music playing]
