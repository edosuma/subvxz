00:03.734 --> 00:05.202
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Dad.

00:05.303 --> 00:08.273
- Happy Halloween.
- Wow, is it Halloween already?

00:08.339 --> 00:10.968
Geez! It slipped my mind.

00:11.042 --> 00:12.042
Before you guys go,

00:12.109 --> 00:13.869
- would one of you get me some juice?
- Okay.

00:19.183 --> 00:21.448
Oh, cute, Dad.

00:21.519 --> 00:22.519
Nice head.

00:22.587 --> 00:26.319
- Cute?
- Did I say cute? I meant terrifying!

00:26.424 --> 00:27.551
Ooh!

00:29.560 --> 00:31.859
- That didn't shock you at all?
- I tried to be scared.

00:31.929 --> 00:33.835
Dad, you gotta face it.
It's a fact of life, you know?

00:33.865 --> 00:36.562
- People grow up.
- How do you explain me?

00:38.369 --> 00:40.395
I gave up a long time ago.

00:44.809 --> 00:46.437
- Good morning, sweetie.
- Good morning!

00:46.511 --> 00:49.050
I have so many things to do today,
I don't even know where to get started.

00:49.080 --> 00:51.709
Hey, you could start off with
a nice hot, relaxing cup of tea.

00:51.782 --> 00:53.648
Oh, that's a good idea.

01:00.758 --> 01:03.193
Oh, my God! Today is Halloween!

01:04.729 --> 01:05.856
I almost forgot.

01:05.930 --> 01:08.900
I gotta go pick up those costumes
before Wilson's party tonight.

01:08.966 --> 01:10.229
- Honey?
- What?

01:11.402 --> 01:14.839
Oh! I'm sorry, honey.
That was really an adorable gag.

01:17.341 --> 01:19.207
I've heard this happened to
other guys my age.

01:19.277 --> 01:21.803
But I just never thought
it would happen to me.

01:21.879 --> 01:24.439
I can't perform.

01:24.549 --> 01:26.211
You were great last night.

01:28.019 --> 01:29.851
Not that!

01:29.921 --> 01:32.152
Gags! I used to be the king of pranks
on Halloween.

01:32.223 --> 01:34.317
So far today, nothing.

01:34.392 --> 01:36.054
Well, look, you got 16 hours left.

01:36.127 --> 01:39.791
I'm sure you can come up with
something totally gross and disgusting.

01:39.864 --> 01:42.629
- You're just saying that.
- No, no.

01:42.700 --> 01:44.430
I mean it from the bottom of my heart.

01:44.502 --> 01:48.064
But really, I gotta go pick up
those costumes for the party, okay?

01:48.172 --> 01:49.697
I'll see you later.

01:51.943 --> 01:55.243
Oh! Oh, man! That was so really scary!

02:46.063 --> 02:48.760
Today, in the spirit of Halloween,
we're gonna take a fresh look

02:48.833 --> 02:52.326
at a room in the house
that's gotten a pretty bad name.

02:53.304 --> 02:55.068
The torture chamber.

02:57.942 --> 03:00.207
You know, I don't really call it
a torture chamber,

03:00.278 --> 03:03.510
I call it a room
of misunderstood machines.

03:03.581 --> 03:04.947
- Misunderstood?
- Yes.

03:05.016 --> 03:08.976
To "The Tool Man," there's no
bad machines, there's just bad people.

03:09.086 --> 03:12.454
I mean, any device in the wrong hands
can cause pain and suffering.

03:12.556 --> 03:15.321
Well, you certainly prove that
every week.

03:17.461 --> 03:19.828
Can we take a look at
our first device over here?

03:19.897 --> 03:22.526
- What's wrong with your hands?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.

03:22.600 --> 03:25.160
Just fell asleep backstage. I'll do this...

03:29.473 --> 03:31.965
Probably be up all night now.

03:32.043 --> 03:33.306
All right. Now, look at this.

03:33.377 --> 03:35.403
You don't see craftsmanship
like this anymore.

03:35.479 --> 03:36.947
Thank goodness!

03:39.216 --> 03:42.948
This happens to be a rack.
It was used to pull people apart.

03:43.020 --> 03:45.251
But not today!

03:45.323 --> 03:48.452
Today it's a lovely fabric stretcher.

03:48.526 --> 03:50.085
Just follow me.

03:50.161 --> 03:52.400
Let's say you've shrunk
your wife's favorite sweater, right?

03:52.430 --> 03:55.867
A few cranks on this bad boy,
it is good as new.

03:58.502 --> 04:01.438
If your wife happens to be
an orangutan.

04:03.007 --> 04:04.737
Don't rule it out, buddy.

04:07.478 --> 04:09.379
Your old clock is ticking, Al.

04:10.481 --> 04:12.814
And I mean that in a very nice way.

04:19.890 --> 04:25.261
You know, I'm not falling for this
ridiculously fake arm for one second!

04:25.329 --> 04:26.367
What are you talking about, fake arms?

04:26.397 --> 04:29.333
I have a pinched nerve.
You laughing at that? Never mind him.

04:30.267 --> 04:31.360
Now look over here.

04:31.435 --> 04:34.132
A perfect example of
a French Revolution guillotine.

04:34.205 --> 04:38.370
All right. I'm gonna play along
about this fake arm. Okay, Tim!

04:38.442 --> 04:40.681
Now, you want to be very careful
with this machine, you know?

04:40.711 --> 04:43.010
Because it can be
very, very dangerous.

04:43.080 --> 04:45.345
Does this look like a fake arm?
Is this fake to you?

04:45.416 --> 04:47.510
It looks pretty real to me!

04:48.719 --> 04:51.689
Fake arm. It took two people
to operate the guillotine.

04:55.359 --> 04:57.590
You put I <i>a tête</i> in here.

04:57.795 --> 04:59.395
<i>- La tête?</i>
- And then you pull this here.

05:02.500 --> 05:05.937
The pain! The pain!

05:07.338 --> 05:08.829
Are you happy now?

05:08.906 --> 05:10.426
Can we go on with
the rest of the show?

05:10.474 --> 05:12.079
I need to scare somebody.
Didn't it scare anybody?

05:12.109 --> 05:15.204
Oh, well, I... Yes, I was...
I'm sure our audience was terrified.

05:15.279 --> 05:19.808
Let's have a big hand
for Tim "The Scary Man" Taylor!

05:19.884 --> 05:21.443
That was very scary!

05:21.552 --> 05:25.182
As a matter of fact, let's have a hand
for his big, stupid, fat...

05:27.324 --> 05:30.294
I'm the king, baby! I'm the king!

05:35.866 --> 05:38.165
I'm just about finished
splitting the wood for your party.

05:38.235 --> 05:40.007
Well, thank you, neighbor.
You know, I'm very anxious

05:40.037 --> 05:42.037
to get your opinion
of this woman I've been dating.

05:42.072 --> 05:44.439
Oh, she's great. Just don't marry her.

05:44.542 --> 05:46.841
- Oh, you haven't even met her.
- Doesn't matter.

05:48.312 --> 05:50.440
Neighbor, you are a yuck a minute.

05:50.514 --> 05:52.676
Yuck-a-minute. Yuck-a-minute.

05:53.250 --> 05:55.310
See?
Even Mozart's got a sense of humor.

05:55.419 --> 05:58.514
Maybe you should put Mozart on
the TV show and have him...

05:58.722 --> 06:01.282
Oh! Wilson, help, help, help!
Oh! Oh, I put...

06:01.592 --> 06:03.151
Oh, my God, Tim!

06:03.260 --> 06:05.491
Put direct pressure on it. I'll call 911.

06:05.563 --> 06:06.563
Wait a minute. Hold on.

06:06.630 --> 06:08.035
- You know what you should do first?
- Yes? Yes?

06:08.065 --> 06:10.500
Let's see if the shoe fits you.

06:16.607 --> 06:18.701
Oh, my God, Tim!

06:19.877 --> 06:21.175
Are you trying to kill me?

06:21.245 --> 06:24.613
Tim, are you trying to kill me?
Tim, are you trying to kill me?

06:24.748 --> 06:27.388
- I mean, I nearly had a heart attack.
- You're not just saying that?

06:27.418 --> 06:31.185
- Well, I'm still hyperventilating.
- I am the king! I'm the king!

06:41.432 --> 06:43.799
Tim, leave the cat alone.

06:46.170 --> 06:48.105
It keeps hissing at me!

07:08.993 --> 07:11.462
Happy Halloween, Wilson.

07:11.529 --> 07:15.193
- Oh, Jill, you look bewitching.
- Thank you.

07:15.266 --> 07:19.829
Yeah. Maybe later tonight we can
go home and make some Munchkins.

07:19.937 --> 07:22.839
Wow! Nice hook.

07:22.907 --> 07:26.435
- Is that cold-forged carbon steel?
- It was my grandma's.

07:28.045 --> 07:30.708
Tim, I'd like you to meet my attorney,
Morgan Billingham.

07:30.781 --> 07:32.750
He's helping me re-do my will.

07:36.353 --> 07:38.117
I hope that's a mask!

07:41.292 --> 07:43.659
Well, Happy Halloween!

07:51.368 --> 07:55.738
That is something else, Al. It's like
a moth on steroids. What happened?

07:55.839 --> 07:59.139
All this coming from a monkey
with clam dip on his tail?

08:00.244 --> 08:02.145
Made you look!

08:03.247 --> 08:06.615
Jill, Tim, I'd like you to meet Agatha,
my special friend.

08:06.717 --> 08:08.379
- Hi, Agatha. Tim Taylor.
- Hello.

08:08.452 --> 08:11.012
Gee!
I thought I was your special friend.

08:11.121 --> 08:12.885
See, Agatha's the woman
I've been dating.

08:12.990 --> 08:15.892
- Oh, it's so nice to finally meet you.
- Good evening.

08:15.960 --> 08:18.657
Well, I'll let you all get acquainted
and go spice up me brew.

08:18.762 --> 08:19.991
Okay. Okay.

08:20.064 --> 08:23.228
- Nice cloak. Are you a vampire?
- I'm a witch.

08:23.334 --> 08:26.236
Oh! Me, too. <i>Bibbidi bobbidi boo!</i>

08:27.137 --> 08:31.268
- Where's your hat?
- I don't wear hats. I'm a real witch.

08:31.342 --> 08:33.868
I'm a real flying monkey.

08:39.149 --> 08:42.517
So, a real witch.
What kind of witch are you?

08:42.586 --> 08:46.853
I'm a Dianic witch.
I realized my power 12 years ago.

08:46.924 --> 08:50.588
Now I'm a high priestess
at the Society of Sisterhood coven.

08:53.564 --> 08:55.658
Well, you know what they say...

08:55.733 --> 08:58.669
Nothing says loving
like something from the coven.

09:04.775 --> 09:08.871
Tim, I just had my palm read.
Guess who I was in a former life?

09:09.446 --> 09:12.006
An Irish lap dancer.

09:13.851 --> 09:15.752
Oh, save me some punch.

09:48.852 --> 09:50.391
Hey. Love some punch.
I hope you didn't make it,

09:50.421 --> 09:52.856
because I'm eye-of-newt intolerant.

09:52.923 --> 09:55.688
You seem to be intolerant of quite a bit.

09:59.263 --> 10:02.290
No, I'm actually... I
tolerate quite a bit...

10:02.366 --> 10:06.599
You know, that's water-based.
Better be careful. You might melt.

10:06.670 --> 10:09.037
You have no idea
who you're dealing with, do you?

10:09.106 --> 10:12.474
Come on, lady. Talk to the hand.
Talk to the hand.

10:14.678 --> 10:19.810
A witch is one you should not test
or else her wrath will never rest.

10:23.887 --> 10:27.119
Great party. So, what's with Agatha?

10:27.257 --> 10:29.954
Oh, you think she's odd, don't you?

10:30.661 --> 10:34.564
Well, I don't know.
"Odd" is kind of a strong word.

10:34.631 --> 10:37.260
Confusing, interesting, and kind of...

10:37.334 --> 10:40.793
Oh, Tim, you think
she's mildly delusional.

10:40.871 --> 10:43.568
I think she's a certifiable nut case,
to be honest with you.

10:43.640 --> 10:46.371
I find her a little bit peculiar myself.

10:46.477 --> 10:48.378
Why is she still
your special friend, then?

10:48.445 --> 10:50.539
Tim, I've tried to break up
with her three times,

10:50.614 --> 10:52.515
but she won't take no for an answer.

10:52.583 --> 10:55.849
I mean, have you ever dated a woman
who scared you?

11:00.357 --> 11:02.826
I mean, if you were in my position,
what would you do?

11:02.893 --> 11:04.919
Well, like you would tell me. I mean...

11:04.995 --> 11:06.300
You gotta be honest, straightforward.

11:06.330 --> 11:08.822
Tell her that it's just,
you know, nicely, that it's over.

11:08.899 --> 11:10.993
- Yes.
- And if that doesn't work,

11:11.068 --> 11:12.832
drop a house on her.

11:14.872 --> 11:18.536
You'll never guess
what the palm reader told me.

11:18.609 --> 11:21.169
That you were Cleopatra
in your last life.

11:21.278 --> 11:23.406
No. That I have a nice butt.

11:27.484 --> 11:30.484
Better be careful. He'll be reading the
back of my palm, I'll tell you that.

11:31.622 --> 11:35.354
Well, I just steered Wilson's
romantic life in the right direction.

11:35.426 --> 11:38.031
- What are you talking about?
- Well, he wasn't getting along with his

11:38.061 --> 11:41.828
new special friend.
So I suggested he just call it off.

11:41.899 --> 11:45.131
Tim, you shouldn't be
butting into his personal life!

11:45.202 --> 11:47.262
I can't believe he listened to you!

11:47.337 --> 11:48.942
We're very close friends, you know?
He trusts me.

11:48.972 --> 11:50.941
We talk about emotional stuff.

11:51.008 --> 11:54.035
You know, I'm a lot more perceptive
than you give me credit for.

11:54.111 --> 11:56.410
- Really?
- Yes.

11:56.480 --> 11:58.244
Your tail's on fire.

12:04.922 --> 12:06.823
Wilson's phone is still busy.

12:06.890 --> 12:10.054
It's probably Agatha trying to yak her
way back into his life.

12:10.160 --> 12:11.822
Hey, guys. When's dinner?
I'm starving.

12:11.895 --> 12:13.056
We're waiting for Wilson.

12:13.130 --> 12:15.102
He was supposed to be here for dinner
30 minutes ago.

12:15.132 --> 12:17.431
This is not like Wilson.
He's usually very punctual.

12:17.501 --> 12:21.563
Well, maybe the wind shifted,
he caught a whiff of your meat loaf.

12:22.306 --> 12:24.878
Why don't you go over to Wilson's
house and see what's keeping him?

12:24.908 --> 12:26.399
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:27.744 --> 12:30.304
And, honey, while I'm gone,
spray something in here.

12:33.283 --> 12:37.015
Oh, what happened here? Wilson?

12:41.058 --> 12:42.890
Wilson?

12:42.960 --> 12:46.089
Hidey ho! Hidey ho!

12:46.163 --> 12:49.258
- Scared me, Mozart!
- Scared me. Scared me.

12:51.969 --> 12:53.301
Wilson!

12:57.207 --> 12:59.438
What's your hat doing here?

13:05.883 --> 13:10.412
A witch's wrath will
never rest, never rest, never rest.

13:19.429 --> 13:21.694
Something is really weird
over at Wilson's house.

13:21.765 --> 13:23.324
Yeah. Well, duh.

13:23.433 --> 13:26.403
No. It looks like it was broken into.
The house has been ransacked.

13:26.503 --> 13:29.463
In the middle of the floor there's a
bunch of these candles sitting around,

13:29.506 --> 13:31.566
and underneath his hat
is Agatha's necklace.

13:31.642 --> 13:33.668
Oh, my God!
What do you think is happening?

13:33.744 --> 13:36.646
Well, I think Agatha, that hex nut,
has done something to Wilson.

13:36.713 --> 13:37.753
I'm gonna call the police.

13:37.814 --> 13:40.943
Okay. It's number three
on the speed dial, there.

13:41.018 --> 13:42.145
Who's Agatha?

13:42.219 --> 13:44.381
She's that witch
that Wilson was dating.

13:44.454 --> 13:47.618
Mom, it's okay. I'm old enough.
You can say the "B" word.

13:49.092 --> 13:51.220
Yes. I'd like to report a break-in.

13:51.295 --> 13:54.459
And a missing person.
It's 508 Glenview Road.

13:54.965 --> 13:57.264
I'm the next-door neighbor.
It's Tim Taylor.

13:57.334 --> 13:58.739
What's the name
of the missing person?

13:58.769 --> 14:00.260
<i>Wilson Wilson.</i>

14:00.337 --> 14:02.272
- We'll be right over.
<i>- Thanks.</i>

14:02.339 --> 14:04.103
We're all set.

14:04.274 --> 14:06.402
Thanks for helping me out.

14:07.844 --> 14:10.905
Now we're gonna find out
who's really the king.

14:12.416 --> 14:14.248
Well, the police are on their way over.

14:14.317 --> 14:15.922
Well, maybe we should meet them
over there, okay?

14:15.952 --> 14:17.682
No, no, no.
What if somebody's in the house?

14:17.754 --> 14:19.393
That's good. That's good.
You guys stay here.

14:19.423 --> 14:22.757
I'll go over there. But I'm gonna need
some protection, guys.

14:27.064 --> 14:29.966
Well, that's a great weapon
if you're attacked by a brisket.

14:33.103 --> 14:36.665
Hook, line and sinker. You were great.

14:36.773 --> 14:38.139
No, no, no. You were great.

14:38.208 --> 14:40.180
Reprogramming that speed dial
was a touch of genius.

14:40.210 --> 14:41.974
I am the queen.

14:45.148 --> 14:47.913
So when was the last time
you saw Mr. Wilson?

14:48.218 --> 14:51.746
Uh, last night at the party. He was
wearing his grandmother's hook.

14:51.988 --> 14:55.083
He likes hooks.
You like kitchen utensils. Drop them.

14:56.760 --> 14:59.730
Do you know of anyone who might
hold a grudge against Mr. Wilson?

14:59.796 --> 15:01.458
Yeah. This Agatha.

15:01.531 --> 15:03.363
- You got a last name?
- No.

15:03.433 --> 15:04.696
Can you give me a description?

15:04.768 --> 15:11.299
Yeah. She was about 5'7",
blonde hair, good-looking, a witch.

15:12.009 --> 15:13.910
A witch?

15:13.977 --> 15:16.811
I better call the boys from the
Emerald City precinct.

15:17.881 --> 15:22.251
No, no, no.
She said she was a real witch.

15:22.352 --> 15:25.516
Do we have anything to link her
to the crime scene? A black cat?

15:25.589 --> 15:26.818
A broom?

15:28.959 --> 15:32.487
How about her amulet that she wore
around her neck? It's right here.

15:34.698 --> 15:37.618
Hey, look at that. It's my fez.
I've been looking all over for this thing.

15:37.667 --> 15:40.330
Your fez?
What happened to the amulet?

15:40.404 --> 15:41.404
Well...

15:42.506 --> 15:46.204
- I had it in my hand.
- You tampered with the crime scene?

15:46.276 --> 15:49.405
I did not know it was a crime.
I did not know it at the time.

15:52.783 --> 15:55.412
Dr. Seuss claims there was a witch.

15:58.355 --> 16:00.483
Got something here, Roberts.

16:00.557 --> 16:01.597
Mr. Taylor, were you aware

16:01.658 --> 16:03.458
that Mr. Wilson had recently
changed his will?

16:04.261 --> 16:07.026
Yes! Yes! Yes!
I met the lawyer at the party!

16:07.264 --> 16:08.755
Yeah, he had big ears.

16:08.865 --> 16:12.427
Probably came in handy
at the hearings.

16:14.438 --> 16:18.205
Are you also aware that in his new will
you're named as sole beneficiary?

16:20.544 --> 16:22.706
I'm his special friend.

16:24.047 --> 16:26.141
And possibly his wealthy friend.

16:26.216 --> 16:30.085
You stand to receive substantial cash
assets and a uranium mine in Brazil.

16:30.153 --> 16:32.088
I didn't know Wilson was rich.

16:32.155 --> 16:35.421
Special friend had no idea.
That's a new one.

16:36.593 --> 16:39.358
People like you make me sick!

16:39.463 --> 16:41.735
You expect us to believe
that you lived next door to this guy

16:41.765 --> 16:44.234
all these years
and had no idea he was loaded?

16:44.301 --> 16:48.033
Calm down, Maclntyre.
You just got your badge back.

16:50.207 --> 16:53.507
Guys, guys, forget about me.
Shouldn't we be looking for Wilson?

16:53.577 --> 16:56.577
Yeah. We'll get that in motion as soon
as you give us some more information.

16:56.613 --> 17:00.709
- Now, look, Tim. Can I call you Tim?
- I'd like that.

17:00.784 --> 17:04.221
You really had no idea about your
neighbor's financial situation?

17:04.354 --> 17:07.381
No, no. I mean, he's a real simple guy.
He eats squirrel.

17:07.457 --> 17:09.483
And he's been wearing
the same hat for 15 years.

17:09.559 --> 17:12.494
Yeah! And that bothered you,
didn't it, Taylor?

17:13.597 --> 17:15.531
Starsky, what's with Hutch over here?

17:17.000 --> 17:18.262
Tragic tale.

17:19.236 --> 17:21.364
Are you guys accusing me
of something?

17:21.438 --> 17:23.703
No, no.
We'd never consider you a suspect

17:23.772 --> 17:26.071
until we had some hard evidence.

17:27.377 --> 17:30.438
Property of Tim Taylor.

17:30.514 --> 17:32.483
You have the right to remain silent...

17:32.716 --> 17:36.414
Hold it.
That's a Halloween prank.

17:36.486 --> 17:38.580
I just used that,
you know, to scare Wilson.

17:38.655 --> 17:41.284
Well, perhaps you scared him to death.

17:41.358 --> 17:43.259
I am the king.

17:49.099 --> 17:51.591
All right, Mr. Taylor,
let's run through it one more time.

17:51.668 --> 17:55.366
We've got your fingerprints on the back
door, a will leaving everything to you...

17:55.438 --> 17:58.738
A crime scene you've tampered with,
and a bloody ax with your name on it.

17:58.809 --> 18:01.244
Okay, back off, McGarrett. Danno!

18:03.046 --> 18:06.107
- You've also got my theory.
- Right.

18:06.182 --> 18:08.481
- A witch did it.
- Right. Right.

18:09.886 --> 18:11.858
You see, I told Wilson that
she was a little nutty,

18:11.888 --> 18:14.585
and he might consider
breaking off the relationship.

18:14.658 --> 18:17.218
Oh, so you're a buttinski, too?

18:17.327 --> 18:19.193
Back off, will you, Baretta?

18:19.930 --> 18:23.367
My point is, I think she's doing this
to get back at Wilson,

18:23.433 --> 18:25.129
and she's blaming me
to cover her tracks.

18:25.202 --> 18:28.002
So you're saying you had nothing
to do with Mr. Wilson's disappearance.

18:28.071 --> 18:29.676
I wouldn't do anything
to my friend Wilson.

18:29.706 --> 18:32.574
You're killing me, Tim.
You're killing me, Tim.

18:33.009 --> 18:35.945
Oh, I'd like to kill that damn bird.

18:36.913 --> 18:38.381
This one's a sicko!

18:38.448 --> 18:41.282
Taking you down would be
worth my badge, pal!

18:41.351 --> 18:45.118
Easy, Maclntyre. Easy.

18:47.591 --> 18:48.591
Tim's coming!

18:48.658 --> 18:50.530
- We'd better hide!
- Hide! In the broom closet!

18:50.560 --> 18:52.160
Broom closet! Broom closet!
There! There.

18:58.602 --> 18:59.968
Hey, Dad. What's going on?

19:00.036 --> 19:01.841
Well, McMillan and Wife think
I had something to do

19:01.871 --> 19:03.840
with his disappearance.

19:03.907 --> 19:06.467
- You?
- My name is Maclntyre.

19:06.576 --> 19:08.807
- I'm Roberts.
- I'm Taylor.

19:08.879 --> 19:11.610
I told him about the witch.
Tell them about the witch at the party.

19:11.681 --> 19:13.650
Oh. She seemed very nice.

19:15.919 --> 19:17.624
Can you corroborate
your husband's whereabouts

19:17.654 --> 19:19.454
during the time
of Mr. Wilson's disappearance?

19:19.556 --> 19:22.082
Oh, yes, I can.
He was with me the whole time.

19:22.158 --> 19:23.158
Thank you, honey.

19:23.226 --> 19:26.663
Except for that 45 minutes
in the middle of the night.

19:29.499 --> 19:32.663
- I was in the bathroom.
- Alone?

19:32.736 --> 19:35.262
Believe me, nobody
would go in there with him.

19:38.008 --> 19:40.477
You were in the bathroom
for 45 minutes?

19:40.543 --> 19:42.774
I had the annual hot rod issue.

19:47.751 --> 19:50.653
So for 45 minutes you have no alibi?

19:52.555 --> 19:53.682
Thank you, Brad.

19:55.125 --> 19:58.254
I think we're ready to take you down to
the station for some more questioning.

19:58.328 --> 20:00.092
You can't do that. He's innocent.

20:00.196 --> 20:03.291
It's that crazy witch.
That's the one that did this.

20:03.366 --> 20:07.133
Better come outside.
There's something you should see.

20:16.880 --> 20:19.748
Good going, guys.
That's the witch, right there.

20:19.883 --> 20:21.818
Witch? Mary's from our crime lab.

20:22.786 --> 20:24.550
No, no, no. That's Wilson's girlfriend.

20:24.621 --> 20:26.487
She was at the party.
That's the witch, right?

20:26.790 --> 20:29.282
Well, there is a slight resemblance.

20:29.359 --> 20:31.851
Slight resemblance... Agatha, right?

20:31.928 --> 20:34.227
I don't know what you're talking about.
What I do know

20:34.297 --> 20:36.425
is this is now officially
a murder investigation.

20:36.499 --> 20:38.365
- Murder?
- Murder?

20:38.435 --> 20:40.063
Are you saying that Wilson's dead?

20:40.136 --> 20:42.342
Yes. Wilson's dead,
and you're under arrest for his murder.

20:42.372 --> 20:43.643
You have the right to remain silent.

20:43.673 --> 20:46.046
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

20:46.076 --> 20:48.773
I'm innocent. I've been framed, here.
Honey, say something about...

20:48.845 --> 20:51.405
We just need a positive ID on the body.

20:51.514 --> 20:53.278
- Body?
- Bring it in.

20:58.788 --> 21:01.952
- Is this Mr. Wilson?
- Oh, God! Yeah.

21:04.661 --> 21:07.597
- Why'd you do it, Dad?
- I didn't do anything.

21:09.132 --> 21:10.191
Boo!

21:14.537 --> 21:17.302
- He never saw it coming!
- Got ya!

21:17.407 --> 21:18.739
You are the king.

21:19.642 --> 21:22.111
I am the king!

21:26.716 --> 21:29.208
Little Mozart. Little Mozart. Little...

21:30.754 --> 21:32.586
Mozart!

21:32.655 --> 21:33.918
Where are you?

21:33.990 --> 21:36.323
Hey, Wilson! He's up here!
Somehow he got out of the cage.

21:36.392 --> 21:37.883
He's up here on this wire!

21:38.094 --> 21:39.460
Tim, you be careful!

21:39.529 --> 21:41.430
It's okay. I got him.
He's right next to me.

21:41.497 --> 21:42.760
Come here, Mozart!

21:42.832 --> 21:44.198
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

21:45.602 --> 21:49.835
Oh, my God! Oh, Lord!

21:49.939 --> 21:53.376
Tim! Tim! Tim, are you all right?

21:53.443 --> 21:55.071
Tim?

21:57.380 --> 22:00.748
- Who's the king now?
- Tim's the king. Tim's the king.
