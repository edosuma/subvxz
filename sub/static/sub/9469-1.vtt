06:07.333 --> 06:10.083
[laughing]

06:10.208 --> 06:12.125
Hmm, man! I've missed you, coz.

06:12.250 --> 06:14.291
I didn't think you were gonna make it.

06:14.417 --> 06:16.792
I ran out of gas in Altoona.

06:16.916 --> 06:20.083
I got followed into a ladies' room
at a truck stop outside of Youngstown.

06:20.166 --> 06:21.583
I had to give a serious ass-kicking.

06:21.667 --> 06:23.625
But I am here now. [chuckles]

06:23.708 --> 06:25.583
Oh, man!

06:25.708 --> 06:27.834
Joe used to bounce me
on his knee when I was little,

06:27.916 --> 06:30.583
and he was old as the hills
and twice as wrinkly, even then.

06:32.708 --> 06:34.458
How's your life?

06:34.583 --> 06:36.333
I show up every day.

06:36.458 --> 06:38.208
It's lonely with you guys gone, you know?

06:38.333 --> 06:41.125
Mom and I are headed out West
in a couple of weeks. Seattle.

06:41.250 --> 06:43.250
Why don't you come with?

06:43.375 --> 06:45.916
Caffeine and drizzle?

06:46.041 --> 06:47.999
What's left for you in Hemlock Grove?

06:49.375 --> 06:52.291
Maybe. Let me think about it.

06:55.845 --> 06:58.958
Man, would you look
at all these old farts?

07:06.500 --> 07:09.625
- Who is that guy?
- I have no clue.

07:09.750 --> 07:11.875
Looks like he's got booty on his mind.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.417
Ew! At a funeral?

07:13.500 --> 07:17.291
Have some respect for the dead,
for Christ's sake.

07:17.375 --> 07:19.916
- Hey...
- Hi!

07:20.041 --> 07:22.083
Hey!

07:22.208 --> 07:23.999
Hi.

07:24.125 --> 07:26.041
You have to come meet
Aunt Sonya. You wanna come?

07:26.166 --> 07:29.041
OK, I haven't peed in 200 miles,
but I'll catch up. OK?

07:29.125 --> 07:31.708
All right, come. Here he is!

07:33.291 --> 07:36.712
- [festive Gypsy music playing]
- [cheering]

07:47.291 --> 07:49.916
[water running]

07:59.417 --> 08:02.750
Get a good look, you sick bastard?

08:03.916 --> 08:05.958
You don't remember me at all, do you?

08:08.083 --> 08:10.667
Our families shared
a campsite in the UP

08:10.792 --> 08:14.166
when our dads got work cutting trees.

08:14.291 --> 08:17.250
Summer of '96.

08:17.375 --> 08:19.333
I used to watch you
swimming in the creek.

08:19.458 --> 08:23.333
- That's creepy. I was nine.
- [man laughs]

08:23.458 --> 08:25.667
I was just looking out
for the safety of all you kids.

08:30.583 --> 08:32.750
Andreas Vasilescu.

08:32.875 --> 08:35.125
I used to drive
the Dairy Dream truck.

08:35.250 --> 08:37.166
I gave free ice cream
to all the Roma kids.

08:37.291 --> 08:39.999
- That was you?
- Orange Creamsicle.

08:40.125 --> 08:42.291
- Still addicted.
- [Andreas chuckling]

08:42.417 --> 08:45.291
My Uncle Tobar fell out
of a blue spruce that summer

08:45.375 --> 08:46.875
and landed on his chainsaw.

08:46.958 --> 08:49.208
I remember them taking the pieces away.

08:51.542 --> 08:56.375
To little girls who grow up to be
beautiful women.

08:56.500 --> 08:59.417
To silver-tongued men

08:59.542 --> 09:02.500
with sweet, dangerous smiles.

09:10.792 --> 09:13.834
- [laughing]
- Yes, yes! Bye.

09:13.958 --> 09:16.500
[Lynda sighs]

09:16.625 --> 09:19.875
- What was that about?
- She has a girl for you

09:19.999 --> 09:22.041
who will scrub your floors
and bear you many children.

09:22.166 --> 09:23.792
What girl?

09:29.291 --> 09:30.667
Pretty.

09:30.792 --> 09:33.708
Clean floors are nothing
to sneeze on. At.

09:34.792 --> 09:36.375
[sighs]

09:38.417 --> 09:40.542
You would have been a good father.

09:40.625 --> 09:43.916
A good husband.
I know it seems impossible now,

09:44.041 --> 09:46.500
but someone else will come along.

09:50.458 --> 09:52.998
Letha's gone.

09:53.083 --> 09:54.625
Let her go.

09:57.375 --> 09:59.041
Let's get something to eat.

10:07.196 --> 10:10.199
[weeping softly]

10:16.208 --> 10:18.627
[gasping, moaning]

10:26.834 --> 10:28.208
[man] Hmm!

10:29.667 --> 10:33.458
Used to be, the burial
of a man of Joe's stature

10:33.583 --> 10:35.667
would have brought a thousand Romani.

10:35.792 --> 10:38.125
Today, how many?

10:38.250 --> 10:40.834
A hundred?

10:40.958 --> 10:44.291
All you kids want
to do nowadays is move on,

10:44.417 --> 10:47.083
become real Americans.

10:47.208 --> 10:49.125
It breaks my heart.

10:50.792 --> 10:53.500
Well, times are changing.

10:53.625 --> 10:55.500
The world's different now.

10:55.625 --> 10:57.542
The world's always changing.

10:57.667 --> 10:59.916
Doesn't mean it's getting better.

11:00.041 --> 11:02.750
Don't forget who you are
or who your people are.

11:04.999 --> 11:07.458
How is your mother anyway?

11:08.417 --> 11:11.208
Tell her I'm always thinking of her,

11:11.333 --> 11:13.458
wondering if she's lonely.

11:17.448 --> 11:20.031
[sirens approaching]

11:28.667 --> 11:30.750
[policeman] Freeze!

11:30.834 --> 11:32.125
Do not run!

11:34.625 --> 11:38.291
Do not attempt to resist arrest.

11:38.417 --> 11:41.916
We have a warrant
to search the premises.

11:42.041 --> 11:44.083
Lynda!

11:44.208 --> 11:46.458
[policeman]
Keep your hands in plain sight!

11:47.916 --> 11:49.834
Lynda!

11:49.958 --> 11:54.935
[policeman] We have warrants
for the arrest of specific individuals.

12:00.166 --> 12:02.792
- [man] Stop struggling.
- [Lynda] Ow! Get off of me!

12:02.916 --> 12:04.291
- The fuck are you doing?
- Stop resisting!

12:07.333 --> 12:08.625
- Peter!
- Come here!

12:08.708 --> 12:09.750
[groans]

12:16.417 --> 12:18.375
They got Lynda.

12:20.916 --> 12:22.999
My Harley's parked behind the house.

12:49.958 --> 12:51.834
[door closing]

12:51.958 --> 12:54.333
[woman] "Credit card fraud, check kiting,

12:54.458 --> 12:57.166
manufacturing counterfeit
handicap placards,

12:57.291 --> 12:59.834
selling muskrat meat
as USDA certified ground beef,

12:59.958 --> 13:02.999
trespassing as a circus clown."

13:03.125 --> 13:05.625
What was she planning to do
with the baby elephant?

13:05.750 --> 13:07.999
She knew a guy.

13:08.125 --> 13:09.916
Your mother's led a colorful life.

13:10.041 --> 13:12.083
It's total bullshit
that her bail was denied.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.083
Lynda's not a threat to anybody.

13:14.208 --> 13:16.375
Law enforcement is making
a case that the Romani

13:16.500 --> 13:18.750
are an organized criminal enterprise.

13:18.875 --> 13:22.083
His mother's not organized, trust me.

13:22.208 --> 13:24.083
These charges are small-time.

13:24.208 --> 13:26.333
- They're Mickey Mouse.
- Doesn't matter.

13:26.500 --> 13:28.999
They're coming after her
under federal RICO statutes.

13:29.125 --> 13:31.083
Racketeering.

13:31.208 --> 13:34.417
It's how the government sends the message
it's keeping America safe.

13:34.500 --> 13:37.125
Your mother could be facing serious time.

13:37.250 --> 13:39.291
- How much?
- Depends on how much of this

13:39.417 --> 13:41.208
the prosecution tries to make stick.

13:41.333 --> 13:45.458
She's being extradited
back to Hemlock County to face charges.

13:48.375 --> 13:50.250
You can stay with me.

13:50.375 --> 13:53.208
At least, she'll have family close by.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.958
It's good that she'll be back
in Hemlock Grove, right?

13:56.083 --> 13:59.583
Mixed. The judge is a twat,
but I know the prosecutor.

13:59.667 --> 14:02.958
- We could try to plea down.
- She can't do a stretch.

14:03.083 --> 14:05.375
She's not Black or Hispanic,
and the Aryan slime

14:05.500 --> 14:07.375
just want to finish off
what Hitler did to our people.

14:07.500 --> 14:09.458
She has no one looking out
for her on the inside.

14:09.583 --> 14:11.458
My retainer's 20,000.

14:14.458 --> 14:16.916
Um...

14:17.041 --> 14:19.208
Can that be paid in installments?

14:19.333 --> 14:22.708
Up-front. That's what "retainer" means.

14:26.916 --> 14:28.916
I don't have $20,000.

14:29.041 --> 14:31.667
I don't have $20. I don't have shit.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.542
Well...

14:37.667 --> 14:39.792
I've got about $500 stashed

14:39.916 --> 14:43.375
and a bunch of junk jewelry
we can sell on eBay.

14:43.500 --> 14:46.583
- So basically, we're fucked.
- Basically. [sighs]

14:49.750 --> 14:52.291
It's not like you don't have friends
in Hemlock Grove.

14:54.875 --> 14:56.792
No.

14:59.083 --> 15:01.083
Maybe this is an opportunity.

15:01.208 --> 15:04.166
A time to mend fences.

15:17.834 --> 15:20.500
Peter?

15:24.916 --> 15:27.375
- Peter?
- What? What?

15:28.583 --> 15:30.916
We're gonna figure this out, cousin.

15:33.208 --> 15:35.250
Lynda's gonna be fine.

15:46.667 --> 15:49.625
[man] Godfrey Industries
has increased its profitability

15:49.750 --> 15:53.083
for the last 17 quarters,
leading the field in biotech,

15:53.208 --> 15:55.625
pharmaceuticals, and genetic engineering.

15:55.708 --> 15:59.500
I am pleased to report we are,
for the fourth year in a row,

15:59.625 --> 16:02.999
the largest privately held corporation
of its kind in North America.

16:03.125 --> 16:05.291
Couple of thoughts.

16:05.417 --> 16:07.750
Anybody been to Maui?

16:11.875 --> 16:13.625
No one?

16:13.750 --> 16:15.792
I just got back.

16:15.916 --> 16:18.125
It's even more beautiful than they say.

16:19.074 --> 16:22.833
- [cheery Hawaiian music playing]
- Say hello to Healani Kaulakakui.

16:25.750 --> 16:29.208
Roman, I don't see how this is relevant.

16:29.333 --> 16:31.750
I fucked this girl. [chuckles]

16:31.875 --> 16:34.083
I fucked her a lot.

16:36.208 --> 16:38.208
Can I say that here?

16:38.333 --> 16:40.708
You can say
what you want...

16:40.834 --> 16:43.667
Godfrey Industries is a leader in
three-dimensional organ printing, right?

16:43.792 --> 16:46.542
Pioneered it. We're in clinical
trials on the beta version

16:46.667 --> 16:48.417
for regenerating gallbladder function.

16:48.542 --> 16:51.458
But the target demographic
for that technology will be dead soon,

16:51.583 --> 16:54.291
which puts a big dent in repeat business.

16:54.417 --> 16:56.583
We should be focusing
our genetic engineering

16:56.708 --> 16:59.333
on enhancing the youth experience.

16:59.458 --> 17:04.701
Bigger, better, tighter,
longer, thicker...

17:04.791 --> 17:08.040
I guarantee you, Healani Kaulakakui
never wants the party to end.

17:08.165 --> 17:10.999
Perhaps we can discuss this
later during sidebar.

17:11.125 --> 17:13.083
Gentlemen, thank you for your time.

17:13.208 --> 17:15.250
Quick question...

17:15.375 --> 17:18.541
about the quarterly earnings report.

17:18.625 --> 17:21.875
Table 47.
Miscellaneous R and D. What's that?

17:24.708 --> 17:26.958
R and D that's miscellaneous.

17:27.083 --> 17:29.083
Seems like a lot of zeroes
are being spent on miscellaneous.

17:29.208 --> 17:31.750
- What for?
- It's extremely technical.

17:31.875 --> 17:33.750
You'd need an advanced degree
in paleovirology

17:33.875 --> 17:35.750
to even begin to understand.

17:37.333 --> 17:40.916
Any of you guys got
an advanced degree in paleovirology?

17:44.500 --> 17:47.875
So, millions of dollars of my money...

17:47.999 --> 17:51.291
is being spent,
and no one knows on what.

17:55.583 --> 17:57.834
Now, that just doesn't feel right.

18:02.125 --> 18:03.542
My mother's gone.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.542
From now on, you'll be dealing with me.

18:05.667 --> 18:07.542
And this runaround bullshit
isn't gonna fly.

18:09.125 --> 18:10.667
You feel me on that?

18:19.291 --> 18:21.166
Roman, you're a bright young man.

18:21.291 --> 18:23.542
Together, there's no limit
to what we can...

18:23.625 --> 18:26.583
Let's take this
to your office, shall we?

18:34.750 --> 18:36.999
I've always had
an understanding with your family.

18:37.125 --> 18:39.458
I keep Godfrey Industries profitable,

18:39.583 --> 18:41.792
I'm given a free hand
to run things as I see fit.

18:41.916 --> 18:45.667
- [Roman urinating]
- How much are you skimming?

18:45.792 --> 18:48.458
You have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

18:48.583 --> 18:52.083
That was uncalled for,
unfair, and wrong.

18:52.208 --> 18:54.999
I asked a question in there.
I expect an answer.

18:55.125 --> 18:58.958
Until I get one, I'm putting a freeze
on all further funding.

18:59.083 --> 19:02.250
- You don't have the authority.
- My mother and Norman

19:02.375 --> 19:04.708
didn't give a shit about whatever it is
you're up to, but the joyride's over.

19:04.834 --> 19:10.250
Everyone has secrets locked away
behind closed doors somewhere, Roman.

19:11.916 --> 19:14.500
I'm certain you'd like me to keep yours.

19:14.625 --> 19:17.083
Oh, you don't want
to squab with me, Pryce.

19:19.250 --> 19:21.708
It won't come out well for you.

19:48.041 --> 19:49.875
[rat squeaking]

20:25.125 --> 20:27.958
[Pryce] Good morning, Olivia.

20:32.958 --> 20:36.083
"Good morning, Dr. Pryce.

20:36.208 --> 20:38.291
I feel like a million bucks!

20:38.417 --> 20:40.875
I'm feeling stronger every day."

20:40.999 --> 20:42.958
[mumbling]

20:43.083 --> 20:45.958
It was three months ago.

20:47.375 --> 20:50.750
It's week 14.
Let's see how we're doing.

20:50.875 --> 20:55.708
I'm feeling as if this recuperation
is never gonna end.

20:55.834 --> 20:59.125
Thanks to you, I'm talking
like I shuck corn for a living.

20:59.250 --> 21:01.250
Learning how to speak
all over again takes time.

21:01.375 --> 21:03.250
Patience, I know, I know.
Just spare me

21:03.375 --> 21:05.291
your daily "ode to self"
where you remind me

21:05.417 --> 21:07.999
I was clinically dead,
in a coma for two months.

21:09.792 --> 21:13.250
How much longer do you intend
to hold me as your gimp hostage?

21:14.625 --> 21:16.458
Open wide.

21:16.583 --> 21:19.208
You're in a grim mood.

21:26.208 --> 21:28.667
Damn, I'm good.

21:29.792 --> 21:31.708
We need to talk about Roman.

21:31.834 --> 21:33.500
Why? Did he ask about me?

21:33.625 --> 21:35.083
Not exactly.

21:35.208 --> 21:37.834
Let's check your lingual dexterity.

21:37.958 --> 21:39.500
Up...

21:39.625 --> 21:41.125
down...

21:41.250 --> 21:42.916
left, right.

21:43.041 --> 21:45.583
Johann, talk to me.

21:45.708 --> 21:47.083
Let's have a look at your leg.

21:50.291 --> 21:52.999
Oh, there's still significant
muscle atrophy.

21:53.125 --> 21:55.583
An inch and a half difference.

21:55.708 --> 21:57.916
To be expected after shortening
the adductor magnus

21:58.041 --> 21:59.916
to harvest the donor tissue
for the lingual transplant...

22:00.041 --> 22:01.291
Johann, damn it!

22:03.667 --> 22:05.750
Your son's been playing
master of the universe.

22:05.875 --> 22:09.375
He's throwing his weight around,
snooping through the books.

22:09.500 --> 22:12.792
He threatened to terminate me
if I don't explain some of our...

22:12.916 --> 22:14.916
more sensitive expenditures.

22:15.041 --> 22:18.792
He has no idea how critical
your work is to our family.

22:18.916 --> 22:20.583
To him.

22:20.708 --> 22:22.417
Ironic.

22:22.542 --> 22:25.250
He must be starting
to get hungry by now.

22:25.375 --> 22:26.708
Yes.

22:28.916 --> 22:31.667
I wonder how he's been satiating.

22:31.792 --> 22:33.667
[Pryce] I shudder to think.

22:38.375 --> 22:40.750
You just can't get enough
of me, can you?

22:54.875 --> 22:57.667
First you pay, then we play.

23:06.166 --> 23:08.250
It's all there.

23:47.625 --> 23:49.667
You want me to start a new crop?

23:49.792 --> 23:51.708
Start tonight.

23:51.834 --> 23:55.333
- It'll take a few days.
- Twice as many next time.

24:33.667 --> 24:36.041
[doorbell rings]

24:38.500 --> 24:40.458
[sighs]

24:45.500 --> 24:47.375
[buzzing]

25:12.458 --> 25:14.916
Nice digs.

25:17.458 --> 25:19.625
Look, I know things
were bad when I split...

25:19.750 --> 25:21.625
- Fuck you.
- Just hear me out.

25:21.750 --> 25:23.958
- Not interested. We're done.
- Please.

25:24.083 --> 25:26.999
Lynda's in jail. I need your help.

25:27.125 --> 25:28.250
No.

25:31.458 --> 25:34.792
Fuck. Be mad at me. But this
is Lynda we're talking about.

25:34.916 --> 25:38.417
Sounds like she fucked up.
Not my problem.

25:38.542 --> 25:41.708
She was always good to you.
She's not gonna make it in there.

25:43.834 --> 25:46.250
What do you want me to do about it?

25:50.542 --> 25:52.750
I need money...

25:52.875 --> 25:54.750
to hire a lawyer.

25:55.834 --> 25:59.857
So you came here to beg. [scoffs]

26:01.375 --> 26:04.834
Can you please loan me
$20,000? I'll pay you back.

26:04.958 --> 26:07.291
I always liked your mother.

26:07.417 --> 26:08.958
She baked cookies.

26:09.958 --> 26:11.583
My mother never baked cookies.

26:12.708 --> 26:14.583
I can shoot you the dough.

26:14.708 --> 26:17.458
I'm not gonna do that.
I'm not giving you shit.

26:17.583 --> 26:19.417
Maybe you forgot I saved your life.

26:19.542 --> 26:21.958
Shelley saved yours.

26:22.083 --> 26:23.875
I think about her all the time.

26:23.999 --> 26:25.792
- She might still be out there.
- She died alone.

26:25.916 --> 26:30.250
And when Letha died,
and I needed you,

26:30.375 --> 26:32.250
you tucked your dick
between your legs and ran away

26:32.375 --> 26:34.375
like the little
fucking bitch you are.

26:39.667 --> 26:41.916
Get out of my house.

26:43.041 --> 26:45.333
Roman, please...

26:45.458 --> 26:47.875
Get out of my house.

27:19.083 --> 27:22.083
[Norman] Today, I said goodbye
to Letha and her baby.

27:22.208 --> 27:25.291
The baby I never got to hold.

27:25.417 --> 27:27.542
It's been hard these weeks,

27:27.667 --> 27:30.999
to accept the fact
that they're both gone.

27:31.125 --> 27:33.583
But spreading their ashes
over the Allegheny

27:33.708 --> 27:36.875
brought closure and resolution.

27:36.958 --> 27:39.792
Maybe this is my way
of saying goodbye to you, too.

27:40.875 --> 27:44.417
You were like a daughter to me, Shelley.

27:44.542 --> 27:47.750
I wish I believed in heaven.

27:47.875 --> 27:50.542
Then I'd have hope of seeing
both my girls again.

27:52.083 --> 27:55.500
Love always,
Uncle Norman.

28:04.125 --> 28:06.041
[sighs]

28:06.166 --> 28:08.041
[birds singing]

28:20.808 --> 28:22.792
[car approaches]

28:26.166 --> 28:29.125
Oh, Christ.

28:44.667 --> 28:46.625
Imported from Ecuador this time of year.

28:46.750 --> 28:48.792
So much for my carbon footprint.

28:50.834 --> 28:52.583
Norman, it's so sweet of you.

28:52.708 --> 28:55.375
Did I, uh, know you were coming over?

28:55.500 --> 28:59.625
No. No, I... I wanted to,
um, to surprise you.

29:01.667 --> 29:04.625
You know I hate surprises. I'm a mess.

29:04.750 --> 29:08.458
You want to give yourself a break.
Been to hell and back.

29:10.041 --> 29:12.166
There's this doctor
that I want you to see.

29:12.250 --> 29:14.208
He's... he's an expert in seizures.

29:14.291 --> 29:16.166
Johann has everything under control.

29:16.291 --> 29:18.750
You put too much faith in Pryce.

29:18.875 --> 29:21.999
I already bit my tongue off once.
It was extremely unpleasant.

29:22.125 --> 29:24.166
I have no intention
of having another seizure

29:24.291 --> 29:26.500
and repeating the experience.

29:26.625 --> 29:31.083
You know, I... I thought
that we could get you out for a walk.

29:31.208 --> 29:35.708
I do not want people staring at me
leaning on a cane like some damn invalid.

29:35.834 --> 29:38.333
I could bring my new car
around and take you for a ride.

29:38.458 --> 29:41.792
Get some wind in your hair. You know,
the leaves are turning, it's...

29:41.875 --> 29:45.083
- Come on!
- Pryce will pitch a fit.

29:46.375 --> 29:48.083
All right, let's do it.

29:48.208 --> 29:50.333
Good girl.

30:03.916 --> 30:05.999
Honest to God, Olivia,

30:06.125 --> 30:09.625
you're as beautiful as the day
my brother brought you home.

30:09.750 --> 30:12.875
What keeps you hanging around, Norman?

30:12.999 --> 30:16.083
Why not take your millions,
buy yourself a jet,

30:16.208 --> 30:20.667
go somewhere...
exotic with a 25-year-old?

30:20.792 --> 30:24.500
Everything I want in life is
standing right in front of me.

30:26.083 --> 30:28.083
You're all I have left.

30:31.834 --> 30:33.417
Am I?

30:35.208 --> 30:36.834
What about your nephew?

30:38.875 --> 30:40.916
Has he been to see you?

30:42.458 --> 30:46.458
He's... busy with other matters.

30:48.208 --> 30:50.083
Thanks for the flowers.

30:57.708 --> 31:00.166
[country song playing]

31:01.375 --> 31:03.041
Hey, you!

31:11.333 --> 31:13.041
Well, it was worth a try.

31:13.166 --> 31:15.583
He's a fucking prick.

31:15.708 --> 31:17.417
You want something to eat?

31:17.542 --> 31:19.792
No, I'm not hungry.

31:24.328 --> 31:25.791
Can I borrow the car again?

31:29.291 --> 31:31.333
Please.

31:36.166 --> 31:37.542
It's on the street.

31:39.542 --> 31:42.041
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

31:42.166 --> 31:44.500
Peter!

31:44.625 --> 31:45.999
Stay out of trouble.

32:18.454 --> 32:19.874
You're the guy, right?

32:24.458 --> 32:26.667
Who's watching over you?

32:26.792 --> 32:28.250
Saint Sebastian.

32:30.999 --> 32:32.792
Let's get this motherfucker done.

32:32.916 --> 32:34.458
I wanna see the money first.

32:42.291 --> 32:44.583
It's all gonna be there
when I count it, right?

32:47.625 --> 32:51.583
"He that is already corrupt
is naturally suspicious."

32:51.708 --> 32:54.834
So are we gonna do this thing or what?

33:06.625 --> 33:08.792
Yeah.

33:08.916 --> 33:10.999
Follow me.

33:20.834 --> 33:23.041
[Peter] You're the first gadji
to sample what my people

33:23.166 --> 33:25.875
once referred to as
"Saint Sebastian's Arrow."

33:25.999 --> 33:28.417
[man] Yeah, I heard of that.

33:28.542 --> 33:31.500
Then you've lived a large life,
my friend, not many people have.

33:31.625 --> 33:34.500
What the fuck is a "gadji"?

33:34.667 --> 33:36.542
It's what Gypsies call outsiders.

33:36.667 --> 33:38.500
I'm dropping ancient knowledge here,

33:38.625 --> 33:41.792
shared only by my people,
but now, I'm sharing it with you.

33:41.916 --> 33:44.583
Totally down with ancient knowledge.

33:44.708 --> 33:47.542
Like the pyramids...
What was that shit about?

33:47.667 --> 33:50.083
Gypsies, man.

33:50.208 --> 33:53.500
Gypsies... Egyptians.

33:53.625 --> 33:55.625
That was us. We built that shit.

33:55.750 --> 33:58.958
And to think I consider
myself a student of history.

33:59.083 --> 34:03.126
[clears throat] The way of the arrow,
like the true purposes of the pyramids,

34:03.271 --> 34:05.375
was lost in the mists of time.

34:07.708 --> 34:09.916
But I brought it back,

34:10.041 --> 34:12.375
figuring out a way to refine it.

34:12.500 --> 34:14.542
Making it 10,000 times more potent.

34:14.667 --> 34:18.958
- Sounds dope.
- Comes on hard, you peak,

34:19.041 --> 34:21.625
then you settle down fast and easy.

34:21.750 --> 34:24.750
Like an arrow flying
through time and space.

34:24.875 --> 34:27.792
Twenty large is a major investment.

34:27.916 --> 34:30.667
- Our boss was hesitant at first.
- But your weed man...

34:30.792 --> 34:34.166
- Our client.
- ... vouched for you,

34:34.291 --> 34:36.208
so we're taking a shot.

34:36.333 --> 34:38.667
You will not regret this.

34:38.792 --> 34:41.542
This isn't even a drug, really.
It's more like a...

34:41.667 --> 34:44.250
a biomorphic portal
into another dimension.

34:44.375 --> 34:46.166
Long as it fucks you up.

34:46.250 --> 34:48.875
And gives our boss
a profit on his capital.

34:48.998 --> 34:51.041
Gentlemen...

34:55.125 --> 34:57.750
I give you Sebzilla.

34:58.625 --> 34:59.916
Tilt your heads back.

35:01.999 --> 35:04.542
Ow! Shit burns!

35:06.542 --> 35:07.958
Good.

35:19.999 --> 35:22.291
[down-tempo music playing]

35:22.375 --> 35:25.166
Yo, I don't feel anything.

35:26.792 --> 35:28.708
Better not be playing with us, holmes.

35:28.834 --> 35:31.708
Chill, it'll happen soon.

35:38.667 --> 35:40.583
Yo, what the fuck?

35:40.708 --> 35:42.291
[spits]

35:42.417 --> 35:44.250
Dude. We don't roll like that.

35:49.999 --> 35:51.500
[cracking]

35:56.125 --> 35:58.667
- [bones cracking]
- [grunting]

36:09.193 --> 36:11.625
[screaming]

36:22.583 --> 36:25.083
- What the fuck?!
- I'm fucked up.

36:37.041 --> 36:39.158
Oh, shit!

36:40.080 --> 36:42.208
[growling]

36:42.291 --> 36:43.625
Fuck!

37:24.125 --> 37:26.958
[panting]

38:14.583 --> 38:16.969
Who wants a beer?

38:18.375 --> 38:21.083
Mix two parts ionized water,
do not use tap,

38:21.208 --> 38:23.542
and one part SEB.
Never leave it in direct sunlight.

38:23.667 --> 38:27.125
Shake well before using,
and keep out of reach of children.

38:27.250 --> 38:31.708
I'm gonna throw in some eyedroppers
because I like you guys.

38:31.834 --> 38:34.500
You do this thing right,
you're looking at a street value

38:34.625 --> 38:36.999
right around a hundred grand.
That's a 500% return.

38:37.125 --> 38:40.542
- Which is a beautiful thing.
- My man!

38:49.291 --> 38:51.750
The street is clear.
You two better bounce.

39:03.625 --> 39:06.333
[coughing]

39:52.583 --> 39:56.333
[thumping]

39:56.458 --> 39:58.041
[groans]

40:02.792 --> 40:05.208
What did you do, Peter?

40:05.291 --> 40:08.834
I just worked
the most beautiful little con.

40:10.083 --> 40:12.166
We're getting the lady lawyer
on the case.

40:13.500 --> 40:15.792
I feel like shit.

40:15.875 --> 40:17.083
[chuckles]

40:18.916 --> 40:21.792
I can't believe you brought them here.
What were you thinking?

40:23.375 --> 40:25.125
You know, actually,
one of those numb-nuts

40:25.250 --> 40:27.625
wants to change his name
to Tony Montana.

40:27.750 --> 40:29.542
This isn't some kind
of fucking joke, Peter!

40:29.667 --> 40:32.792
You turned on the wrong moon!

40:32.875 --> 40:35.333
Come on, D.
I did what I had to do.

40:35.458 --> 40:37.333
Yeah, but at what price?

40:37.458 --> 40:39.708
You have no idea how fast
this can destroy you.

40:39.834 --> 40:43.125
- You'll never see it coming.
- Take it easy, OK?

40:43.250 --> 40:46.417
You could end up a vargulf.

40:46.500 --> 40:49.667
- It might already be too late.
- OK, I get it.

40:49.750 --> 40:52.125
I'm sorry.

40:52.208 --> 40:53.583
It was a one-time thing.

40:55.708 --> 40:57.875
I had to walk home because of you.

41:05.999 --> 41:08.375
You couldn't have squeezed them for 25?

41:12.125 --> 41:13.708
Eat.

41:13.834 --> 41:16.208
[woman] The cochleae and myelin sheaths

41:16.333 --> 41:18.333
of the neural portion
and auditory system

41:18.458 --> 41:20.333
are now fully developed.

41:20.458 --> 41:22.834
[woman speaking Russian]
Readings of cerebral function

41:22.958 --> 41:25.333
demonstrate extremely
high integration

41:25.458 --> 41:27.333
[woman speaking Russian]
of sensory iformation.

41:27.458 --> 41:30.125
The subject is building
unique lattice works

41:30.250 --> 41:32.458
of iron, nitrogen, and phosphorus

41:32.583 --> 41:34.375
[speaks Russian]
on her endoskeletal platform.

41:34.500 --> 41:37.418
Is the fore portion
of the cranium adapting well

41:37.542 --> 41:39.417
to the enlarging frontal cortex?

41:39.500 --> 41:42.583
[speaking Russian]
Yes, and sooner than anticipated.

41:42.708 --> 41:46.375
Good. She's rapidly approaching
extrauterine viability.

41:46.500 --> 41:48.041
But we will want to ramp down

41:48.166 --> 41:49.708
[speaks Russian]
her metabolic functions

41:49.792 --> 41:51.083
to increase longevity.

41:51.208 --> 41:53.542
I want her ready for extraction
in two weeks.

41:53.667 --> 41:56.375
[speaking Russian]
It shouldn't be a problem.

41:56.500 --> 41:58.708
[Pryce speaking Russian]
Let's hope so.

42:15.375 --> 42:17.333
It's beautiful.

42:21.999 --> 42:24.333
I dropped the cash off
with the lady lawyer.

42:24.458 --> 42:28.041
She said some of the statutes
on the warrants might be expired.

42:28.125 --> 42:30.333
Yeah, I've got a good feeling about this.

42:30.417 --> 42:32.417
I gotta go.

42:32.500 --> 42:34.625
[man on TV]
Fire marshals are continuing

42:34.750 --> 42:36.916
their investigation
into a suspicious fire

42:36.999 --> 42:39.208
at a warehouse in the west end...

42:44.208 --> 42:46.083
[man] Announce yourself.

42:46.208 --> 42:49.041
Uh, your sign says
you're looking for a driver.

42:49.166 --> 42:51.667
Not just a driver,
a tow-truck driver.

42:51.792 --> 42:55.333
- I've got my class four license.
- Yeah, so do a lot of people.

42:55.458 --> 42:57.875
I'm looking for somebody
with a good eye and a steady hand.

42:57.999 --> 43:00.834
There's a whole art
and a science to it.

43:02.250 --> 43:03.542
Jackalope.

43:03.627 --> 43:05.155
Ah.

43:06.166 --> 43:09.125
No sense letting perfectly
good roadkill go to waste.

43:09.250 --> 43:13.125
I'm sorry, are you looking for a driver
or are you looking for an animal stuffer?

43:15.125 --> 43:16.958
An operator.

43:17.083 --> 43:19.375
We got two trucks and only one driver.

43:24.208 --> 43:27.542
- I like the flying cat.
- That's my pussy-bird.

43:27.625 --> 43:30.583
You ever drive
a hook-'em-up truck before?

43:30.667 --> 43:32.583
Yeah, a couple times.

43:32.667 --> 43:34.625
Well, you can't be any worse
than the last idiot.

43:34.708 --> 43:35.916
Pays 12 bucks an hour.

43:37.083 --> 43:38.750
Works for me.

43:38.834 --> 43:41.291
You'll need to fill out some paperwork.

43:45.542 --> 43:49.792
[man on TV] A man and his son were found
dead at the bottom of Nickelson Gorge.

43:49.875 --> 43:53.125
Authorities believe that Robert Dexter
of Ellenville, New York,

43:53.208 --> 43:56.083
and his infant son
had been hiking along a footpath

43:56.166 --> 43:57.750
at the top of the cliff
and lost their footing.

43:57.834 --> 43:59.750
Hey!

43:59.834 --> 44:02.750
However, the cause of death
is still under investigation.

44:02.833 --> 44:05.292
[broadcast continues indistinctly]

44:05.375 --> 44:09.208
- Hey! I'm talking to you!
- [slams clipboard]

44:09.333 --> 44:11.500
- You don't toot the whacky?
- What?

44:11.625 --> 44:13.542
I don't hire dope fiends,
atheists, communists,

44:13.667 --> 44:15.583
nancy boys, PETA whack jobs or Jews.

44:15.708 --> 44:17.750
Yeah, got it.

44:17.875 --> 44:19.417
Fill these out.

44:20.500 --> 44:23.291
Be back here tomorrow morning at 6:30.

44:23.375 --> 44:25.500
And, uh, don't be late.

44:56.667 --> 44:59.999
[dance music playing]

45:57.667 --> 45:59.875
Can I buy you a drink? You look lonely.

45:59.958 --> 46:01.834
I have a drink...

46:02.875 --> 46:04.417
and I have a date.

46:08.458 --> 46:10.625
You can have both those things
and still be lonely.

46:10.708 --> 46:12.916
Hey, friend, she's mine.

46:12.999 --> 46:15.500
You hear something?
Sounded like whining.

46:15.583 --> 46:17.916
Yeah, that's, uh, that's the guy.

46:17.999 --> 46:22.166
That's my date. He said,
"Hey, friend, she's mine."

46:22.250 --> 46:24.916
Is that true? You belong to him?

46:24.999 --> 46:26.958
No.

46:27.041 --> 46:28.916
But the thing is,

46:28.999 --> 46:31.125
he's got a little anger management issue.

46:31.250 --> 46:33.834
And this guy, this date,

46:33.916 --> 46:36.083
this hypothetical person
with the short fuse...

46:37.166 --> 46:38.625
is he showing you a good time?

46:40.166 --> 46:41.999
Not really.

46:44.500 --> 46:45.834
OK, cocksucker...

46:47.166 --> 46:48.625
You know, you better watch out.

46:53.291 --> 46:55.291
Come on.

47:06.031 --> 47:08.691
[engine racing]

47:14.068 --> 47:16.935
[techno music playing]

47:29.750 --> 47:31.916
I'm so fucking wet.

47:35.238 --> 47:38.061
[heart beating]

47:38.151 --> 47:41.053
[blood swirling]

47:53.212 --> 47:55.542
[tires screeching]

47:56.916 --> 47:58.208
Get out.

47:58.333 --> 48:00.333
Are you fucking kidding me?

48:00.458 --> 48:03.083
- Get the fuck out!
- What the fuck's your problem?

48:03.208 --> 48:05.333
[whimpers]

48:12.375 --> 48:14.708
[tires screeching]

48:14.834 --> 48:17.708
[thunder cracks]

48:17.834 --> 48:20.125
[opera playing]

48:32.417 --> 48:35.166
[thunder rumbling]

48:46.166 --> 48:47.999
[beeping]

48:53.417 --> 48:56.999
It's been another
very long day, Mr. Godfrey.

48:57.125 --> 48:59.999
You can go.
Lucy will be here soon.

49:18.250 --> 49:21.834
