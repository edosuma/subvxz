WEBVTT

00:01.418 --> 00:05.127
(waves crashing)

00:05.296 --> 00:06.627
Rachel:
It's gross.

00:06.798 --> 00:07.913
Just throw it back.

00:08.091 --> 00:11.083
(Cyndie scoffs)
It'll dry out.

00:11.261 --> 00:13.092
- It smells terrible.
- (groaning)

00:13.263 --> 00:14.423
We can empty it out,

00:14.597 --> 00:16.588
stuff it full of
Miss lris' sage,

00:16.766 --> 00:18.267
and some of
the lavender, too.

00:18.435 --> 00:19.550
Then what?

00:19.728 --> 00:20.934
Then you have
an awesome bear

00:21.104 --> 00:23.095
that survived
the stormy sea, Rachel.

00:23.273 --> 00:25.935
I had one just like this
when l was your age, and--

00:26.109 --> 00:28.600
Oh, shit! Look!

00:28.778 --> 00:31.941
Don't run!

00:33.241 --> 00:36.108
One hit.

00:36.286 --> 00:37.571
I didn't have to twice.

00:37.746 --> 00:39.702
Not bad, huh?

00:39.873 --> 00:42.615
- (spear squelches)
- Yeah.

00:43.668 --> 00:45.750
Look!
Another one!

00:46.796 --> 00:48.457
(sighs)

00:48.631 --> 00:52.920
Come on.
Don't run!

01:05.815 --> 01:08.397
Cyndie: Wait!

01:14.866 --> 01:17.278
She's not a bobber.

01:17.452 --> 01:19.488
(birds cawing)

01:22.040 --> 01:24.372
She's alive.

01:29.422 --> 01:31.128
We still gotta do it.

01:31.299 --> 01:32.664
No.

01:32.842 --> 01:35.094
We don't have to do it.

01:37.180 --> 01:38.511
Yes, we do.

01:38.681 --> 01:42.845
No, we don't,
not if people don't find out.

01:46.481 --> 01:48.813
We're supposed to.

01:48.983 --> 01:50.564
I want to.

01:51.694 --> 01:52.854
I don't.

01:53.029 --> 01:54.815
So we won't.

01:57.867 --> 01:59.653
Are you gonna tell?

02:00.870 --> 02:03.361
Just tell me
if you're gonna tell,

02:03.540 --> 02:04.950
if you're a snitch.

02:06.251 --> 02:08.412
I'm not a snitch.

02:09.420 --> 02:11.502
But I'm not
going to help.

02:11.673 --> 02:15.006
(birds cawing)

02:20.431 --> 02:22.888
(water splashes)

02:23.059 --> 02:24.469
(sighs)

02:37.282 --> 02:39.898
(grunting)

02:49.919 --> 02:51.500
(music playing)

03:30.251 --> 03:33.960
(birds chirping)

03:36.507 --> 03:38.793
Eight rusty cans
of okra

03:38.968 --> 03:41.345
and a bottle
of aspirin.

03:44.974 --> 03:47.761
That's what we got to show
for our time out here...

03:49.520 --> 03:52.102
other than the fact
that we're still standin'.

03:52.273 --> 03:54.264
Rule number one
of scavenging--

03:54.442 --> 03:57.525
there's nothing left
in this world that isn't hidden.

03:57.695 --> 03:59.231
We just
have to find it.

03:59.405 --> 04:00.656
Mm, good.

04:00.823 --> 04:03.030
We just
have to find it.

04:03.201 --> 04:07.035
For a second there...
(chuckles) l was worried.

04:07.205 --> 04:11.369
Listen, we went farther
than we were supposed to.

04:11.542 --> 04:14.409
There's nothing left
out here.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.454
We don't even have
enough gas to keep looking

04:18.633 --> 04:20.339
even if we wanted to,
okay?

04:20.510 --> 04:22.375
We said we'd be gone
for two weeks.

04:22.553 --> 04:23.929
It's been two weeks.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.883
As long as Hilltop keeps
their side of the bargain,

04:26.057 --> 04:27.672
we have food
at home.

04:27.850 --> 04:29.465
We need ammo.

04:29.644 --> 04:31.726
We need medicine.

04:31.896 --> 04:33.056
(scoffs)

04:33.231 --> 04:34.562
We can't go back
like this.

04:34.732 --> 04:36.188
There's people
counting on us.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.224
Why you acting like
you don't know that?

04:38.403 --> 04:42.066
I'm not sure that means much
to me anymore.

04:42.240 --> 04:46.574
What we did
at the satellite station...

04:48.288 --> 04:50.870
all of those people
that we killed...

04:52.667 --> 04:54.157
You didn't see it,
okay?

04:54.335 --> 04:55.996
You just saw
what was left.

04:56.170 --> 04:57.501
No.

04:57.672 --> 05:00.209
I had to do it, too.

05:00.383 --> 05:03.216
Yeah,
we all had to...

05:03.386 --> 05:05.468
for some milk
and some corn.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.549
That wasn't
the only reason.

05:07.724 --> 05:08.804
And yeah, we did.

05:08.975 --> 05:10.055
You know we did.

05:10.226 --> 05:12.182
See, that's--
that's the thing.

05:12.353 --> 05:14.639
You saw
how we were living back home

05:14.814 --> 05:16.554
before you guys
got there.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.098
We didn't know shit.

05:19.485 --> 05:20.565
We thought...

05:20.737 --> 05:22.102
- (chuckles)
- What?

05:22.280 --> 05:23.736
What?

05:23.906 --> 05:25.237
It doesn't matter.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.364
| get it now.

05:32.373 --> 05:36.457
If it's you or someone else,
you choose you.

05:36.627 --> 05:40.540
You take what you can,
you take out who you have to,

05:40.715 --> 05:43.707
and you
get to keep going.

05:44.969 --> 05:46.049
(scoffs)

05:46.220 --> 05:48.347
Nobody's in this together, okay?

05:48.514 --> 05:51.756
Not anymore.

05:51.934 --> 05:53.549
Hey.

05:53.728 --> 05:55.559
It only hurts because
you know what you just said

05:55.730 --> 05:57.391
is total bullshit.

05:57.565 --> 05:59.851
That's not you,
Heath.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.517
Tara...

06:09.160 --> 06:11.116
that's me...

06:11.287 --> 06:13.118
that's you...

06:15.124 --> 06:18.992
and that's everybody
who wants to stay alive.

06:20.963 --> 06:22.999
That's the truth.

06:26.344 --> 06:29.632
We can push towards the shore,
but after today...

06:29.806 --> 06:31.421
we go back.

06:33.476 --> 06:36.513
Even if we just have
those rusty cans.

06:40.650 --> 06:41.685
(keys jingle)

06:41.859 --> 06:45.147
(engine starts)

06:49.200 --> 06:53.944
(chatter,
children laughing in distance)

06:54.122 --> 06:56.408
(clock ticking)

07:14.851 --> 07:17.433
(waves splashing, birds calling)

11:01.744 --> 11:03.109
Woman:
No, I got it. Thanks.

11:03.287 --> 11:05.699
Woman #2: Did they find anything
out there yesterday?

11:05.873 --> 11:07.329
Ev said
she reached the mouth.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.580
Are you serious?

11:08.751 --> 11:10.867
What'd she see?
Nothing.

11:11.045 --> 11:13.127
All the way
down there.

11:13.297 --> 11:14.833
Not a damn thing.

11:17.635 --> 11:19.921
(door creaks)

11:36.153 --> 11:38.405
(children laughing)

11:42.785 --> 11:46.027
(laughter continues,
door closes)

12:03.264 --> 12:06.506
(indistinct conversations)

12:11.605 --> 12:14.938
(conversations continue)

12:16.318 --> 12:19.651
(woman laughs)

12:57.735 --> 13:02.149
(door creaks)

13:15.211 --> 13:18.999
(door closes)

13:31.602 --> 13:34.844
- (gunshots)
- (gaSDS)

13:38.943 --> 13:42.401
(gunshots)

13:58.629 --> 14:00.790
(grunts)

14:00.965 --> 14:03.627
(panting)

14:05.511 --> 14:07.422
Go ahead.

14:13.269 --> 14:15.180
(gun cocks)

14:21.110 --> 14:22.600
(gun thuds)

14:24.196 --> 14:26.278
Doesn't matter.

14:26.448 --> 14:28.905
We're supposed to.

14:29.076 --> 14:32.489
Rachel, no.

14:33.622 --> 14:36.580
(guns cocking)

14:45.384 --> 14:47.170
Hi.

14:49.013 --> 14:50.549
ljust, uh...
I didn't mean to.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.714
(chuckles nervously)

14:52.892 --> 14:54.507
Look, I'm cool.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.635
I'm not here
to hurt anyone.

14:57.813 --> 14:59.098
Rachel...

14:59.273 --> 15:02.390
everyone,
just lower your guns.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.149
Cyndie,
get away from her!

15:05.321 --> 15:06.310
Cyndie: She hasn't
done anything wrong.

15:06.488 --> 15:08.149
That has nothing
to do with it.

15:08.324 --> 15:09.564
Get away!

15:16.332 --> 15:17.447
Tara:
I'm sorry.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.581
ljust walked in--
crawled.

15:19.752 --> 15:22.118
ldidn't even know
I was in.

15:24.506 --> 15:26.713
I can just go.

15:31.138 --> 15:32.719
Okay.

15:32.890 --> 15:34.551
(chuckles nervously)

15:34.725 --> 15:37.137
This is cool, too.

15:37.311 --> 15:39.427
We just
keep doing this.

15:46.654 --> 15:49.987
(birds chirping)

16:00.334 --> 16:03.246
(grunts)

16:12.846 --> 16:15.337
What do we think?

16:18.143 --> 16:21.761
Lotta blind spots
down there.

16:22.898 --> 16:26.140
(Tara sighs)

16:27.444 --> 16:29.560
(grunts)

16:34.076 --> 16:36.112
(grunts)

16:36.286 --> 16:38.663
(bottle shatters)

17:07.443 --> 17:09.604
(door creaks)

17:38.015 --> 17:40.472
Let's check
behind the tarps first.

17:40.642 --> 17:43.554
(sighs)

17:45.647 --> 17:49.185
(birds calling)

17:54.948 --> 17:57.280
Looks like they had plans
for something.

17:57.451 --> 18:00.864
Looks like they didn't
get to finish.

18:06.460 --> 18:07.700
It's heavy.

18:07.878 --> 18:10.244
Could be something good
in there.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.376
(grunts)

18:15.594 --> 18:16.629
Tara.

18:16.804 --> 18:18.089
(grunting)

18:18.263 --> 18:19.423
Hold on.
Hold on!

18:19.598 --> 18:23.386
(grunts)

18:23.560 --> 18:25.391
(walkers growling)

18:36.907 --> 18:39.899
(grunting)

18:52.131 --> 18:55.123
(gunshot)

18:55.300 --> 18:56.710
That way! Go!

18:59.638 --> 19:03.631
(walker growling)

19:03.809 --> 19:06.676
Heath!
Tara!

19:06.854 --> 19:08.264
Heath!

19:14.528 --> 19:16.564
(bells ringing in distance)

19:16.738 --> 19:18.194
(air horn blows)

19:18.365 --> 19:20.651
Natania: We just need to hear
what she has to say.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.942
Beatrice: No. The longer we wait,
the more our community's at risk.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.202
Natania: We agreed to discuss this
together as a group

19:25.372 --> 19:26.578
if someone ever got in.

19:26.748 --> 19:28.488
We made that decision
a long time ago.

19:28.667 --> 19:29.907
(door opens)

19:33.005 --> 19:34.211
(sighs)

19:35.924 --> 19:37.710
Do you, uh,
need to use the bathroom

19:37.885 --> 19:39.125
before we get started?

19:40.762 --> 19:41.922
Wow.

19:42.097 --> 19:44.429
Uh, no.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.558
Um, thank you.

19:47.728 --> 19:49.138
But maybe...

19:52.357 --> 19:53.392
I'm Natania.

19:53.567 --> 19:58.561
This is Kathy and Beatrice,
whom you've already met.

19:58.739 --> 19:59.899
(bells continue)

20:00.073 --> 20:02.450
Am I the only one
hearing bells?

20:02.618 --> 20:03.698
They're ours.

20:03.869 --> 20:05.279
We have six of them--

20:05.454 --> 20:07.945
some nearby,
some a couple of miles away.

20:08.123 --> 20:09.738
What about
the air horn?

20:09.917 --> 20:12.954
We could only find
so many bells.

20:13.128 --> 20:14.413
They are to redirect
any of the dead

20:14.588 --> 20:18.376
that might have been drawn
by it.

20:18.550 --> 20:20.757
(sighs)
Not bad.

20:20.928 --> 20:23.010
It helps sometimes.

20:23.180 --> 20:25.466
But a branch in the wind,
leaves rustling...

20:25.641 --> 20:28.804
we're lucky
this is a relatively clear area.

20:28.977 --> 20:31.229
The evacuations,
the barges--

20:31.396 --> 20:33.648
if they were even real.

20:33.815 --> 20:35.225
So...

20:35.400 --> 20:38.984
where are you from?

20:39.154 --> 20:41.315
Atlanta...

20:41.490 --> 20:44.402
a long time ago.

20:45.577 --> 20:47.158
ljust stayed on the move.

20:48.664 --> 20:51.121
My friend and |--
we've been traveling around

20:51.291 --> 20:54.078
on our own for a couple of years now.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.834
We used to work
on a fishing boat.

20:56.004 --> 20:57.460
There's someone
with you?

20:57.631 --> 20:58.996
There was.

20:59.174 --> 21:00.710
We got separated.

21:00.884 --> 21:04.877
What kind of fishing boat
did you work on--

21:05.055 --> 21:07.467
trawler, seiner,
larder?

21:07.641 --> 21:10.724
Oh, last one.
You got it.

21:11.770 --> 21:15.228
What were you
doing here?

21:15.399 --> 21:17.811
You must understand,
we get nervous

21:17.985 --> 21:21.068
when peoplejust
find their way into our home.

21:21.238 --> 21:24.071
Yeah,
l-l saw that.

21:24.241 --> 21:26.482
My friend and |--
we found this settlement

21:26.660 --> 21:28.821
built on a bridge,
or what was left of it.

21:28.996 --> 21:30.236
We were scavenging,

21:30.414 --> 21:32.826
and we got attacked
by walkers-- the dead.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.207
We were trying
to get away from them,

21:35.377 --> 21:37.242
and I got
knocked off a bridge.

21:37.421 --> 21:39.912
I fought the current,
wound up in the inlet.

21:40.090 --> 21:43.378
The estuary?

21:43.552 --> 21:44.712
The bay?

21:44.886 --> 21:46.501
Look, I'm not good
with geography.

21:46.680 --> 21:49.922
ljust thought
I was dead out there.

21:50.100 --> 21:51.931
And I got to the shore,
and ljust passed out.

21:52.102 --> 21:53.512
Beatrice:
It's the bridge on Windsor.

21:53.687 --> 21:55.268
You-- you know
how to get there?

21:55.439 --> 21:56.519
We do.

21:56.690 --> 21:58.021
She didn't answer
the question.

21:58.191 --> 21:59.271
I didn't?

21:59.443 --> 22:00.649
What was the question?

22:00.819 --> 22:02.275
What were you
doing here?

22:02.446 --> 22:03.936
When that girl, Cyndie,
brought me food,

22:04.114 --> 22:06.605
ljust pretended like I was out
and I followed her back.

22:06.783 --> 22:08.193
It seemed like
she had a camp,

22:08.368 --> 22:09.949
and I wanted to see
if! could get any help.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.076
Then why were you
sneaking around?

22:12.247 --> 22:15.455
I wanted to see
if it was safe.

22:15.625 --> 22:17.126
Still not sure.

22:17.294 --> 22:20.627
Look, I'm sorry
that l freaked you out.

22:20.797 --> 22:22.253
Really.

22:22.424 --> 22:24.039
But if you just point me
in the right direction, I'm gone.

22:24.217 --> 22:27.675
I need to get back to the bridge
and look for my friend.

22:27.846 --> 22:30.838
If we let you go,
you have us at a disadvantage.

22:31.016 --> 22:33.302
You know a great deal
about us now.

22:33.477 --> 22:36.184
- "If" you let me go?
- Yes.

22:36.355 --> 22:39.847
You see, normally,
we would've killed you already.

22:40.025 --> 22:43.859
We shoot strangers on sight
if they come into our camp.

22:44.029 --> 22:46.145
But Beatrice said
you spared your life,

22:46.323 --> 22:49.986
and my granddaughter almost
lost hers trying to save you--

22:50.160 --> 22:52.116
"that girl," Cyndie.

22:53.705 --> 22:55.912
So it leaves us
with the question still

22:56.083 --> 22:59.166
of what to do
with you instead.

22:59.336 --> 23:01.247
Yeah.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.830
That's a pickle,
all right.

23:06.426 --> 23:08.382
Why don't you rest up?

23:08.553 --> 23:09.759
We'll talk more later.

23:09.930 --> 23:12.387
Maybe one of us will have
a brainstorm.

23:13.975 --> 23:15.476
(handcuffs rattle)

23:15.644 --> 23:17.635
Cool.

23:17.813 --> 23:19.929
(door creaks)

23:20.107 --> 23:23.099
(children laughing)

23:25.320 --> 23:27.311
(door creaks)

23:27.489 --> 23:29.821
(lock clicks)

23:29.991 --> 23:32.323
(crickets chirping)

23:36.248 --> 23:38.364
(door creaks)

24:03.984 --> 24:06.066
(door creaks)

24:22.878 --> 24:24.584
Natania:
Hope you like fish.

24:26.173 --> 24:28.539
Uh, the dried kind?

24:28.717 --> 24:30.457
She brought you
salted perch.

24:30.635 --> 24:31.715
(chuckles)

24:31.887 --> 24:33.878
Natania:
Did you like it?

24:34.055 --> 24:35.386
Sure.

24:35.557 --> 24:37.263
No, you didn't.

24:37.434 --> 24:38.674
(chuckles)

24:38.852 --> 24:40.308
Not so much.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.640
We're having stew.

24:44.649 --> 24:45.809
Oh, that's right--

24:45.984 --> 24:48.100
you two haven't formally met,
have you?

24:48.278 --> 24:50.269
Tara,
this is Cyndie.

24:50.447 --> 24:51.778
Hey.

24:51.948 --> 24:54.200
Uh, thank you
for the beach and...

24:54.367 --> 24:56.323
everything out there.

24:56.495 --> 24:59.032
I mean, you saved my life.
(chuckles)

25:00.123 --> 25:02.739
You did.

25:02.918 --> 25:05.330
I mean, I don't know if your
grandma totally approves, but...

25:05.504 --> 25:07.119
(chuckles)

25:07.297 --> 25:09.788
My mom would've.

25:10.884 --> 25:13.466
She showed me
the way.

25:13.637 --> 25:15.047
A way.

25:16.264 --> 25:17.970
l was trying
to show Rachel.

25:18.141 --> 25:19.722
The little girl?

25:19.893 --> 25:21.224
Yeah.

25:22.896 --> 25:24.602
She hasn't
had to do it yet.

25:24.773 --> 25:27.105
Have you?

25:33.698 --> 25:35.859
I'm a really good shot.

25:36.034 --> 25:38.400
Natania:
Yes, you are.

25:38.578 --> 25:40.159
Okay, let's eat.

25:40.330 --> 25:42.286
Let's talk.

25:43.875 --> 25:46.287
Beatrice: Tara.

25:59.266 --> 26:00.631
When was the last time
you ate?

26:00.809 --> 26:02.549
Do soy-sauce packets
count as food?

26:02.727 --> 26:05.184
We have an endless supply
of fish here--

26:05.355 --> 26:08.722
one of the perks
of living so close to the ocean.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.765
You, um,
you think, Tara,

26:10.944 --> 26:13.686
it's something
you could get used to?

26:14.781 --> 26:16.282
I'm hoping
to convince you to stay.

26:16.449 --> 26:17.905
Wait. What?

26:18.076 --> 26:19.407
Why not?

26:19.578 --> 26:22.160
It would be the perfect solution
to our problem.

26:22.330 --> 26:23.991
We keep our village
a secret,

26:24.165 --> 26:26.201
and you'd get
to put down roots.

26:26.376 --> 26:29.368
You're a skilled fighter, Tara,
and a good person.

26:29.546 --> 26:31.207
I can tell that.

26:31.381 --> 26:33.497
You wouldn't be
leaving anything behind.

26:33.675 --> 26:36.257
And if you want, we can help you
find your friend.

26:36.428 --> 26:39.135
And if he wants to stay,
we'll offer him a home, too.

26:39.306 --> 26:40.842
He could stay here?

26:41.016 --> 26:43.382
Is there a reason
why not?

26:43.560 --> 26:45.175
I mean...

26:47.188 --> 26:48.803
well, I never thought
I'd be asking this,

26:48.982 --> 26:50.973
but where are
all the men?

26:59.284 --> 27:00.865
All of them?

27:01.036 --> 27:05.029
(sighs) We got into a skirmish
with another group.

27:05.206 --> 27:08.073
None of them made it.

27:08.251 --> 27:11.084
And we lost others, too.

27:12.339 --> 27:16.082
Cyndie had an 11-year-old
brother, my grandson,

27:16.259 --> 27:19.171
and their mother, too,
my daughter.

27:25.101 --> 27:26.432
After that,

27:26.603 --> 27:29.845
we decided to protect ourselves,
no matter what.

27:30.023 --> 27:34.016
No matter who we crossed,
we would kill on sight.

27:34.194 --> 27:38.733
We left our old home with just
the clothes on our backs.

27:38.907 --> 27:42.274
And then
we found this place.

27:42.452 --> 27:44.784
We would stay hidden.

27:49.709 --> 27:52.951
And we would
stay alive.

27:53.129 --> 27:56.041
Tara, you could have hurt us,
and you didn't.

27:56.216 --> 27:59.049
l-l know we must sound like
monsters to you,

27:59.219 --> 28:00.834
but I had to
be honest

28:01.012 --> 28:03.879
so maybe you could understand
why we do it.

28:04.057 --> 28:05.638
Maybe you could...

28:05.809 --> 28:07.299
consider staying.

28:07.477 --> 28:10.389
And maybe you
could be honest with us

28:10.563 --> 28:12.303
about where you're from.

28:12.482 --> 28:14.188
l was telling you
the truth.

28:14.359 --> 28:15.599
Really?

28:15.777 --> 28:18.484
You said you worked on
a fishing boat, a larder.

28:18.655 --> 28:19.861
That's right.

28:20.031 --> 28:23.489
Tara, a larder is a room
used for storing meat.

28:23.660 --> 28:25.651
Yeah.
I was lying.

28:25.829 --> 28:28.115
(chuckles)

28:29.999 --> 28:32.081
(inhales deeply)

28:36.506 --> 28:38.462
I come from a community.

28:38.633 --> 28:40.874
And that's really
what it is.

28:41.052 --> 28:44.010
We live with each other.
We help each other.

28:44.180 --> 28:45.511
We have walls,
houses.

28:45.682 --> 28:49.345
l have a girlfriend
I want to get back to.

28:49.519 --> 28:51.305
And we've done things...

28:51.479 --> 28:54.061
just like you.

28:54.232 --> 28:56.644
(sighs)

28:58.319 --> 28:59.934
There were these people.

29:00.113 --> 29:02.320
They were threatening us.

29:02.490 --> 29:04.526
We found out they were using
an old satellite station

29:04.701 --> 29:05.986
to operate out of.

29:06.161 --> 29:07.947
We went out there
in the middle of the night,

29:08.121 --> 29:09.281
and we...

29:09.456 --> 29:13.995
took them out,
every one of them.

29:15.587 --> 29:17.953
These people
got what they deserved.

29:18.131 --> 29:20.747
They chose to kill
and to terrorize people,

29:20.925 --> 29:23.382
but that's not
why we killed them.

29:23.553 --> 29:25.384
We didn't do it to make
the world a better place.

29:25.555 --> 29:29.389
We did it because we wanted
to stay alive, just like you.

29:30.643 --> 29:32.304
And I know that you think
that me staying

29:32.479 --> 29:33.844
is the only solution.

29:34.022 --> 29:35.478
Well, how's this
for brainstorming--

29:35.648 --> 29:37.354
maybe our groups
can start working together.

29:37.525 --> 29:38.856
We just told you

29:39.027 --> 29:40.392
that we don't want anyone
to know about this place.

29:40.570 --> 29:42.606
You can't
live like that forever.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.112
I think we can.

29:44.282 --> 29:45.692
Look, l--
(sighs)

29:45.867 --> 29:47.573
| get why you're doing it,

29:47.744 --> 29:49.154
but if you keep seeing everyone
as an enemy,

29:49.329 --> 29:50.409
then enemies
are all you're gonna find.

29:50.580 --> 29:53.242
Sooner or later,
you're gonna need a friend.

29:53.416 --> 29:56.203
(sighs)
We can protect each other.

29:56.377 --> 29:58.959
We'd be safer
than we are--

30:07.472 --> 30:08.552
All right.

30:08.723 --> 30:12.090
We could send a guide out
with her.

30:13.478 --> 30:15.218
Help her
look for her friend,

30:15.396 --> 30:19.059
and then continue on
to their community,

30:19.234 --> 30:22.647
just-- just to see
what it's like.

30:24.239 --> 30:26.525
Yeah, I'll do it.
(clears throat)

30:26.699 --> 30:27.905
I want
to go with her.

30:28.076 --> 30:29.361
Natania:
Absolutely not.

30:29.536 --> 30:31.572
You left
without leaving a routing plan,

30:31.746 --> 30:33.361
without signing
with the gate.

30:33.540 --> 30:36.122
Cyndie, I thought
we were through with all this.

30:36.292 --> 30:37.452
We are.

30:37.627 --> 30:38.867
You will be staying
behind the fence

30:39.045 --> 30:41.036
until you learn
some responsibility.

30:41.214 --> 30:42.750
If this works out,

30:42.924 --> 30:46.212
there will be
plenty of other chances.

30:46.386 --> 30:48.047
And if it doesn't...

30:48.221 --> 30:50.257
I don't want you there.

30:52.725 --> 30:55.307
There will be
other chances.

30:57.730 --> 30:59.311
(chuckles)

31:00.441 --> 31:02.853
Are you sure there isn't
a fishing boat called a larder?

31:03.027 --> 31:04.563
'Cause I'm, like,
pretty sure that--

31:04.737 --> 31:07.399
- There isn't.
- Yeah. Fair enough.

31:13.997 --> 31:14.986
Tara: This is
gonna get better--

31:15.164 --> 31:17.075
people getting together.

31:17.250 --> 31:19.491
That's how the world
is gonna be the world again.

31:19.669 --> 31:22.081
Natania:
I hope you're right.

31:22.255 --> 31:23.335
Be safe.

31:23.506 --> 31:25.087
Where's Cyndie?

31:25.258 --> 31:27.749
She's in the cabin,
sulking.

31:27.927 --> 31:29.303
(chuckles)
We wouldn't be doing this

31:29.470 --> 31:31.677
if it wasn't for her
breaking all the rules.

31:34.350 --> 31:36.636
Good luck, Tara.

31:39.188 --> 31:43.056
Yeah. Uh, you know,
we'll-- we'll work on that, Natania.

31:43.234 --> 31:44.610
Thank you.

31:44.777 --> 31:46.278
See you soon.

31:50.283 --> 31:55.869
(indistinct conversations)

32:00.460 --> 32:01.449
(spits)

32:01.628 --> 32:04.711
See you later,
Rachel.

32:30.949 --> 32:32.359
Hey, Beatrice.

32:32.533 --> 32:35.070
I'm sorry
about the hit.

32:35.244 --> 32:37.451
Well,
you got lucky.

32:37.622 --> 32:38.862
Yeah, I did.

32:39.040 --> 32:41.998
How far are we
to the bridge?

32:42.168 --> 32:44.079
About halfway there.

32:44.253 --> 32:45.333
Stick close.

32:45.505 --> 32:48.212
It's pretty thick
through here.

32:48.383 --> 32:50.044
(walker growling)

32:50.218 --> 32:51.958
(branches snapping)

32:57.892 --> 33:01.805
(knife clangs)

33:02.939 --> 33:04.895
I got it.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.318
(growling)

33:17.078 --> 33:19.785
(gunshots)

33:44.230 --> 33:45.970
(grunting)

33:46.149 --> 33:48.686
(breathing heavily)

34:00.288 --> 34:04.201
(leaves rustling)

34:19.766 --> 34:21.506
(both grunting)

34:39.869 --> 34:43.032
(breathing heavily)

34:43.206 --> 34:44.867
Please.

34:47.460 --> 34:51.294
I could have killed you
back in the village.

34:51.464 --> 34:53.170
Let me go.

34:53.341 --> 34:56.048
You don't
have anything left.

34:56.219 --> 34:58.005
Your people are dead.

34:58.179 --> 35:00.215
(breathing heavily)

35:00.389 --> 35:01.765
The Saviors.

35:01.933 --> 35:04.800
That satellite post
you took out--

35:04.977 --> 35:07.764
you have no idea
what you started.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.304
We didn't start anything.

35:09.482 --> 35:11.097
We ended it.
They're dead.

35:11.275 --> 35:12.981
You didn't stop them.

35:13.152 --> 35:15.108
You can't stop them.

35:15.279 --> 35:17.986
That was just
an outpost.

35:18.157 --> 35:21.524
There are more--
more Saviors...

35:21.702 --> 35:23.158
more outposts.

35:23.329 --> 35:26.913
If they know
about your friends...

35:28.292 --> 35:30.203
it's already
too late for them.

35:30.378 --> 35:32.994
The Saviors...

35:34.799 --> 35:36.585
they did this to you?

35:36.759 --> 35:39.091
They're the ones
that killed all your men?

35:42.723 --> 35:44.224
Every man...

35:45.393 --> 35:48.351
every boy over 10.

35:48.521 --> 35:50.933
They lined 'em up
and shot 'em in the head.

35:53.734 --> 35:55.941
You see,
we tried to fight...

35:56.112 --> 35:58.569
just like you.

35:58.739 --> 36:00.479
They won.

36:00.658 --> 36:03.775
And we were supposed
to keep working for them.

36:03.953 --> 36:07.741
Then one night,
we just left.

36:07.915 --> 36:10.167
We got away, okay?

36:10.334 --> 36:12.290
We are not gonna let you
lead them back to us.

36:14.964 --> 36:16.750
They get what they want.

36:19.552 --> 36:21.793
(sniffles)
I'm sorry you didn't get--

36:21.971 --> 36:25.463
(grunts)
Go! Run!

36:44.952 --> 36:48.194
(panting)

36:50.249 --> 36:51.580
Cyndie: Wait!

36:51.751 --> 36:53.833
(panting continues)

37:01.177 --> 37:03.293
You're not
gonna shoot me.

37:03.471 --> 37:04.961
Because I saved you?

37:05.139 --> 37:06.345
Three times now.

37:06.515 --> 37:08.801
You're not
gonna shoot me.

37:12.021 --> 37:13.431
You have to swear...

37:13.606 --> 37:15.813
that you'll never
come back

37:16.817 --> 37:18.432
and that you'll never
tell anyone about us,

37:18.611 --> 37:20.602
noteven
your own people.

37:24.825 --> 37:28.534
Why... would I come back?

37:28.704 --> 37:31.662
Why would ltell anyone
about this place?

37:31.832 --> 37:34.369
Because maybe you could
get something out of it--

37:34.543 --> 37:37.285
anything.

37:37.463 --> 37:40.876
Why did we kill those two people
who just came near us?

37:43.219 --> 37:45.505
Why did you kill
all those people

37:45.680 --> 37:47.591
at that satellite station?

37:47.765 --> 37:51.633
Because you all thought
you had to.

37:52.895 --> 37:56.433
But none of you had to.

37:56.607 --> 37:58.643
You just did.

38:01.654 --> 38:03.144
Nobody's evil.

38:04.740 --> 38:08.232
They just decide
to forget who they are.

38:10.413 --> 38:14.372
You have to swear.

38:19.005 --> 38:21.496
Some people are evil,
Cyndie.

38:21.674 --> 38:23.790
I've seen it.

38:25.761 --> 38:27.968
That's why
I have to get back now.

38:28.139 --> 38:30.676
You have to swear.

38:32.685 --> 38:34.266
(sighs)

38:41.152 --> 38:42.688
I swear.

38:49.702 --> 38:50.987
Here.

38:51.162 --> 38:53.198
Food and water.

38:53.372 --> 38:54.703
(sniffles)
C'mon.

38:54.874 --> 38:56.830
I'll take you
to the bridge.

38:57.001 --> 38:59.413
Try not
to fall off this time.

39:09.847 --> 39:12.554
(walkers growling)

39:12.725 --> 39:13.965
Cyndie:
There's more, right?

39:14.143 --> 39:15.553
Tara:
Yeah, a lot.

39:15.728 --> 39:17.218
I'll use the cars as cover
until I can't anymore.

39:17.396 --> 39:18.476
Then what?

39:18.647 --> 39:21.354
I'll run.

39:21.525 --> 39:22.901
I love to run.

39:23.069 --> 39:25.151
It's my favorite thing.

39:25.321 --> 39:27.653
You'll never make it.

39:27.823 --> 39:29.529
Yeah, I will.

39:30.534 --> 39:31.910
Let me help you.

39:32.078 --> 39:33.659
You already did.
You got me here.

39:33.829 --> 39:35.911
Just go back.
Tell them that l attacked you.

39:36.082 --> 39:37.162
They know you,
Tara.

39:37.333 --> 39:38.573
No, tell them
you killed me.

39:38.751 --> 39:39.991
They know me.

39:40.169 --> 39:41.784
You know
I'm not going anywhere

39:41.962 --> 39:45.796
until you get
to the other side-- safe.

39:45.966 --> 39:49.584
I've got my rifle.
I've got ammo.

39:49.762 --> 39:52.253
I didn't get you here
just to watch you die.

39:53.974 --> 39:57.592
So let's just get this
over with, okay?

39:57.770 --> 40:02.389
Kathy and Beatrice--
they know we were coming here.

40:02.566 --> 40:04.477
They're coming.

40:04.652 --> 40:07.018
(breathing heavily)

40:07.196 --> 40:08.436
Okay.

40:10.533 --> 40:13.320
Why aren't you like
the rest of them,

40:13.494 --> 40:17.203
after everything
that's happened?

40:20.292 --> 40:22.908
Why aren't you?

40:27.633 --> 40:29.294
Okay.

40:37.143 --> 40:40.556
(walker growling)

40:58.330 --> 41:00.912
(grunts)

41:02.835 --> 41:06.419
- (walker growling)
- Ah!

41:06.589 --> 41:09.126
(walkers growling)

41:27.818 --> 41:29.103
Okay,
up on that side.

41:29.278 --> 41:32.645
Go!

41:36.494 --> 41:38.860
(growling continues)

41:55.221 --> 41:58.463
(gunshot)

41:58.641 --> 42:00.381
(growling continues)

42:00.559 --> 42:02.140
(grunting)

42:02.311 --> 42:03.972
(gunshots)

42:13.822 --> 42:15.983
(gun clicks)

42:16.158 --> 42:17.659
(sighs)

42:17.826 --> 42:21.114
(growling continues)

42:31.757 --> 42:32.963
Tara: Heath!

42:33.133 --> 42:34.259
Heath!

42:34.426 --> 42:35.586
Heath!

42:35.761 --> 42:38.173
(walkers growling)

42:42.393 --> 42:44.224
(gunshot)

42:44.395 --> 42:45.475
(gun clicks)

42:45.646 --> 42:47.637
- (gun thuds)
- (grunts)

42:53.320 --> 42:55.402
Heath, I'm coming!

42:55.573 --> 42:56.779
I'm coming!

42:56.949 --> 43:00.191
No! Go! Go!

43:00.369 --> 43:02.735
We're in this together!

43:02.913 --> 43:04.619
I know.

43:04.790 --> 43:07.031
(walkers growling)

43:12.047 --> 43:15.380
(walkers growling)

43:32.818 --> 43:35.355
(grunting)

43:39.867 --> 43:43.359
(growls)

44:26.455 --> 44:29.868
Tara:
Maybe that was you.

44:37.466 --> 44:39.457
I hope that was you.

44:47.768 --> 44:51.101
("Everything's Fucked"
by The Dirty Three playing)

45:22.302 --> 45:25.635
(walker growling)

45:32.938 --> 45:36.271
(wind chimes clinking)

45:51.248 --> 45:54.490
(music continues)

47:13.747 --> 47:17.080
(gate clangs, squeaking)

47:27.427 --> 47:29.839
(music continues)

47:42.484 --> 47:44.395
(music fades)

47:44.570 --> 47:47.027
I'm sorry, Tara.

47:51.827 --> 47:53.818
I'm sorry, too.

48:04.840 --> 48:07.126
Guns, ammunition...

48:08.927 --> 48:10.588
you don't have
anyleads?

48:14.808 --> 48:17.515
Anything, anywhere.

48:17.686 --> 48:19.677
I don't care
how dangerous it looked.

48:19.855 --> 48:21.516
Tell me a place.

48:21.690 --> 48:23.601
I'll go.

48:27.154 --> 48:29.236
There's gotta be somewhere.

48:31.074 --> 48:33.690
We can square this.

48:36.079 --> 48:38.411
We can
make this right.

48:39.499 --> 48:41.239
We have to.

48:43.879 --> 48:46.666
We can't.

48:48.759 --> 48:52.092
I didn't see anything
like that out there.

49:05.442 --> 49:09.060
