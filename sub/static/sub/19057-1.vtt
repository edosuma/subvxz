<i># When I come home at night #</i>

01:16.676 --> 01:18.760
<i># She will be waiting #</i>

<i># She'll be the truest doll

01:30.356 --> 01:31.885
Ina!

01:32.625 --> 01:36.147
Ina! Ina, get up!

01:36.763 --> 01:38.631
Come here.

01:38.831 --> 01:41.401
You... you need to go right now!

01:41.501 --> 01:43.837
- Get up! You need to go!
- You're scaring me.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.798
Please, listen to me.

02:15.735 --> 02:18.772
Ina, you have to go! Right now!

02:18.872 --> 02:22.417
Please, please, just leave! Ina, leave me!

02:22.517 --> 02:25.757
You need to get out of here right now! Now!

02:27.630 --> 02:30.433
The Lord has delivered you unto me...

02:30.533 --> 02:33.789
...and I will take thy head from thee!

02:55.241 --> 03:00.071
<i>1912, the year that marks the sinking of
the Titanic, the debut of the Oreo cookie...</i>

03:00.171 --> 03:04.617
<i>...just look it up, and also one of the puzzling
and notorious murders in Iowa history.</i>

03:04.717 --> 03:08.054
<i>Today marks 100 years
since the Villisca axe murders.</i>

03:08.154 --> 03:12.358
<i>A century-old unsolved axe murder,
eight people hacked to death...</i>

03:12.458 --> 03:14.961
<i>...has intrigued twenty-first
century forensic scientists...</i>

03:15.061 --> 03:17.130
<i>...and investigators around the world.</i>

03:17.230 --> 03:22.235
<i>Okay, I think I just saw something
move behind the camera.</i>

03:22.335 --> 03:26.833
<i>If this is Lena or Ina,
please let me know you're in here.</i>

03:28.608 --> 03:30.177
<i>Lena?</i>

03:31.027 --> 03:32.531
<i>Ina?</i>

03:34.581 --> 03:35.776
<i>Hello?</i>

03:38.251 --> 03:41.688
<i>And finally, we've reached the number one
most haunted place in America.</i>

03:41.788 --> 03:45.458
<i>I'd been a paranormal investigator for about
11 years and up to that point, I'd never...</i>

03:45.558 --> 03:50.390
<i>The most grisly, terrifying,
unsolved murders of the 20th century.</i>

04:06.879 --> 04:08.441
Okay.

04:19.192 --> 04:20.930
<i>You have 1 new message.</i>

04:21.029 --> 04:24.082
<i>Hey, Caleb, this is Mom.
I have to do a double shift today...</i>

04:24.182 --> 04:26.709
<i>...so I won't be home until
at least after 9 or 10 tonight.</i>

04:26.809 --> 04:30.303
<i>Just a reminder, tomorrow
before you leave, I'd like to...</i>

04:30.403 --> 04:33.029
<i>...um, visit the cemetery, of course...</i>

04:39.846 --> 04:42.108
Too early to start celebrating?

04:43.716 --> 04:45.519
I'm being sad.

04:46.669 --> 04:50.099
Come on, man.
It's your last day of school, ever!

04:55.161 --> 04:56.829
- Denny.
- Yo?

04:56.929 --> 05:00.199
- This town blows, man.
- Tell me about it, dude.

05:00.299 --> 05:02.301
- You don't know.
- Yeah, I know.

05:02.401 --> 05:04.230
You don't know.

05:18.284 --> 05:21.114
Excuse us! Coming through.

05:24.190 --> 05:25.091
We survived.

05:25.191 --> 05:27.994
- Thank you for the ride, Denny.
- Of course, buddy.

05:28.094 --> 05:32.499
- By the way, what are we doing tonight?
- Oh, all will be revealed this evening.

05:33.199 --> 05:36.502
Gotta tell ya, Denny,
I will not miss your cryptic bullshit.

05:36.602 --> 05:39.472
What are you talking about?
You love my cryptic bullshit.

05:39.572 --> 05:44.042
- It's like one of my major features.
- Shut up. No, you did not.

05:45.537 --> 05:48.948
Look who's here, everybody's favorite faggot.

05:51.350 --> 05:54.955
- Why don't you back off, Connor?
- Yeah, I'm not talking to you, freak.

05:56.355 --> 05:58.858
God, I haven't seen you
since, what, last summer, buddy?

05:58.958 --> 06:01.160
Underneath the bleachers, remember?

06:01.260 --> 06:04.163
You had Jerry Fletcher's dick in your mouth.

06:05.965 --> 06:09.104
Caleb! Caleb, stop it!

06:10.236 --> 06:13.773
Fucking psycho. Just like your old man.

06:13.873 --> 06:18.244
- Oh, yeah! Hit me, come on, do it!
- Stop! Shut up and back up!

06:18.344 --> 06:20.746
Do you want me to call your dad again?

06:20.846 --> 06:22.308
No, ma'am.

06:24.283 --> 06:26.385
And Dennis, what are you doing here?

06:26.485 --> 06:29.856
I'm sorry, Mrs. Flanks. I just thought it'd be
nice to give Caleb a ride on his last day.

06:29.956 --> 06:31.824
- I'm sure he'd love that.
- Fuck you, Connor.

06:31.924 --> 06:33.926
Not one more word!

06:34.026 --> 06:36.162
It's a nice sentiment, Dennis.

06:36.262 --> 06:40.266
But would you please take your
little bike and get off my campus?

06:40.366 --> 06:42.335
Sure thing, Mrs. Flanks.

06:42.435 --> 06:44.330
Later, Caleb.

06:45.271 --> 06:47.133
Bye, buddy.

06:49.408 --> 06:51.092
Boys...

06:51.620 --> 06:54.008
...the gymnasium is this way.

06:54.108 --> 06:56.142
Why don't we all go together?

07:17.336 --> 07:19.338
Oh, my gosh, you have to see this.

07:19.438 --> 07:21.874
I know, I heard about it all
this week. So excited.

07:21.974 --> 07:24.710
- Excited?
- You know what I mean.

07:24.810 --> 07:27.274
I do. I bookmarked it.

07:29.248 --> 07:31.250
- <i>Hey, bitch.</i>
- <i>Dude.</i>

07:31.350 --> 07:34.120
- <i>That girl in the bathroom, she passed out.</i>
- <i>What? What?</i>

07:34.220 --> 07:36.823
<i>The new girl! The new girl from Chicago!</i>

07:36.923 --> 07:39.559
<i>Fuckin' camera! Give me the camera.</i>

07:42.561 --> 07:45.432
- <i>What's your name?</i>
- <i>I'm Connor.</i>

07:45.932 --> 07:48.168
- <i>Connor?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

07:48.768 --> 07:52.004
- <i>You guys are weird here.</i>
- <i>What do you mean, here?</i>

07:52.104 --> 07:54.697
- <i>In Iowa.</i>
- <i>What's wrong with Iowa?</i>

07:54.797 --> 07:56.886
<i>Who lives in Iowa?</i>

07:58.577 --> 08:00.180
<i>I live in Iowa.</i>

08:00.580 --> 08:03.269
<i>Connor, we live in Iowa.</i>

08:07.256 --> 08:11.518
- That can't be her.
- Don't be stupid. It's definitely her.

08:28.507 --> 08:30.003
Hi.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.002
Hey.

09:05.945 --> 09:08.968
- What do you want, Rob?
- Connor wants to talk to you.

09:09.648 --> 09:12.311
Yeah, I don't think that's going to happen.

09:13.285 --> 09:15.995
Everybody knows you're gonna
come crawling back.

09:17.156 --> 09:18.651
Slut.

09:24.029 --> 09:26.884
- What do you want?
- Nothing, man. Such a bitch.

09:26.984 --> 09:28.527
Yeah.

09:30.002 --> 09:33.572
Hey, did you see what I wrote
on her locker? It's right here.

09:33.672 --> 09:35.508
Oh, fuck!

09:35.608 --> 09:38.685
Ah! Oh, shit!

09:40.346 --> 09:42.568
- He started it.
- Go to the nurse.

09:42.668 --> 09:45.755
You, in my office. Now.

09:47.753 --> 09:50.366
Come on. Quick time.

10:04.904 --> 10:06.672
Sorry about that.

10:06.772 --> 10:09.202
Don't be. Kid's a jerk.

10:23.789 --> 10:28.120
I told you if you just focused you'd be in
and out of here by the end of the month.

10:30.562 --> 10:32.305
Any plans?

10:33.098 --> 10:35.468
I'm leaving for Omaha tomorrow.

10:35.568 --> 10:40.840
My uncle owns a motel.
Said I could have a job if I had this.

10:41.440 --> 10:45.945
Well, listen, before you take off,
I'd like to have a little chat with you.

10:46.645 --> 10:50.033
I know this has been
a difficult time for you and your mom.

10:50.903 --> 10:54.520
But, Caleb, when you walk out that door
there's nothing else I can do for you.

10:54.620 --> 10:58.327
- I wasn't expecting you to.
- That's not what I meant, Caleb.

10:58.857 --> 11:00.860
I know you're a smart kid.

11:01.660 --> 11:04.166
But life is about the choices we make.

11:04.266 --> 11:08.200
And we have to do our best
to make the good ones.

11:08.300 --> 11:11.330
Otherwise, we get stuck
living in the bad ones.

11:26.886 --> 11:28.447
Okay.

11:31.090 --> 11:33.386
Let me know how it goes in Omaha.

11:55.147 --> 11:58.951
<i>Hey, guys. So today's
a pretty exciting day for me.</i>

11:59.051 --> 12:02.822
For the final outing of the Maryville
Paranormal Institute...

12:02.922 --> 12:07.126
...we will be visiting the boss fight
of ghost houses, Villisca.

12:07.226 --> 12:11.697
<i>As always, I will be joined by my best
friend and fellow ghost hunter, Caleb.</i>

12:11.797 --> 12:13.966
<i>Countdown begins now.</i>

12:14.066 --> 12:15.367
<i>Tonight.</i>

12:15.467 --> 12:18.588
<i>The Villisca axe murder house.</i>

12:30.115 --> 12:31.977
Love you, Mom.

12:38.824 --> 12:42.461
<i>You've gotta know, Jess, in a couple
of months all this shit's gonna go away.</i>

12:42.561 --> 12:44.163
It's already been a couple of months, Ellie.

12:44.263 --> 12:48.434
And today, while I was at school
two girls were watching it again.

12:48.534 --> 12:52.338
God, I hate this place.
I miss you guys. I miss Chicago.

12:52.438 --> 12:55.541
<i>Well, get your ass back here
and stop hanging out with farmers.</i>

12:57.242 --> 13:00.599
Uh, you know, actually this kind of
cool thing did happen today at school.

13:00.699 --> 13:01.847
<i>Yeah?</i>

13:01.947 --> 13:05.584
So Rob came up to me today and was
like "Connor wants to talk to you."

13:05.684 --> 13:08.854
And I just walked away and he was
yelling all this mean shit at me.

13:08.954 --> 13:11.790
And then this other kid,
I think his name is Caleb...

13:11.890 --> 13:15.427
...he went up to Rob and just
slammed his face into the locker.

13:15.527 --> 13:19.131
- <i>What?</i>
- Yeah. It was awesome.

13:19.231 --> 13:22.067
<i>Yeah. Okay, uh, what's his last name?</i>

13:22.167 --> 13:23.606
Um...

13:23.706 --> 13:25.985
- <i>Hirsche?</i>
- Hirsche. What? How did you...

13:26.085 --> 13:28.828
<i>Facebook. Geographic search.
Perfect for stalking.</i>

13:28.928 --> 13:31.422
- Oh, my God, you're creepy.
- <i>Wait a minute.</i>

13:31.522 --> 13:34.780
- What?
- <i>He's got his address on Facebook.</i>

13:34.880 --> 13:37.282
- And?
- <i>Go!</i>

13:37.983 --> 13:38.918
No, Ellie.

13:39.018 --> 13:42.454
<i>Look, at least go tell him to take
his fucking address off Facebook!</i>

13:42.554 --> 13:46.759
<i>Jess, you're a Chicago woman. Do this, bitch!</i>

13:46.859 --> 13:48.260
<i>Come on!</i>

13:48.360 --> 13:53.465
Okay, okay, okay, fine. Whatever.
I'll go... to his house.

13:53.565 --> 13:55.868
But if I get murdered,
it's totally your fault.

13:55.968 --> 13:58.731
<i>Girl, please, nothing ever happens in Iowa.</i>

13:59.204 --> 14:02.441
- Give me that. You can take that.
- Brooks Brothers?

14:02.541 --> 14:06.346
- Where'd you get a Brooks Brothers shirt?
- Not this one.

14:07.846 --> 14:09.409
No.

14:12.618 --> 14:16.622
- Now, what time are you leaving tomorrow?
- Around noon. Greyhound.

14:16.722 --> 14:19.558
- Awesome.
- What, riding a bus?

14:19.658 --> 14:21.360
No, seriously.

14:21.460 --> 14:25.691
Going someplace else,
getting out of here... it's awesome.

14:26.999 --> 14:28.834
What's up?

14:29.234 --> 14:30.893
- Nothing.
- Denny.

14:30.993 --> 14:32.521
Nothing.

14:32.871 --> 14:34.640
I mean...

14:34.740 --> 14:37.546
It's like two hours away.
You can visit any time you want.

14:42.915 --> 14:45.568
- Oh, shit. We gotta move.
- For what?

14:45.668 --> 14:47.519
The tour.

14:47.619 --> 14:50.255
- Dude, no.
- Yeah.

14:50.355 --> 14:52.825
We've been planning this for,
like, two months, dude.

14:52.925 --> 14:55.826
- The Maryville Paranormal Institute.
- We're not even close.

14:55.926 --> 14:59.431
The Villisca axe murder house.
Last video. Big finish.

14:59.531 --> 15:00.632
- No.
- You promised.

15:00.732 --> 15:04.365
You promised to help me pack last night,
instead we got drunk, so...

15:06.171 --> 15:11.143
Well, me and your
"high school equivalency..."

15:11.243 --> 15:13.412
This isn't even a real diploma.

15:13.712 --> 15:15.925
- What are... what are you doing?
- We're going to Villisca.

15:16.025 --> 15:19.379
- No, no, no. Don't, don't, don't! Denny!
- Oh, no. Did I rip it...

15:21.653 --> 15:22.755
- Give me that.
- Now, easy.

15:22.855 --> 15:25.024
Denny, really, don't make me hurt you.

15:29.495 --> 15:32.274
- Give it! Give it to me!
- What, what, what?

15:32.374 --> 15:34.382
Quit fucking around...

15:35.801 --> 15:38.137
- Oh.
- Am I interrupting something?

15:38.237 --> 15:39.925
Hey.

15:40.305 --> 15:43.866
Your name is Jessica, right? This is Denny.

15:43.966 --> 15:47.346
Yeah. We gotta go, dude.
We're gonna miss our tour.

15:47.546 --> 15:50.082
- Where are you guys going?
- Somewhere you're not.

15:50.182 --> 15:51.777
Ow.

15:53.152 --> 15:55.320
- You wanna come?
- Are you sure?

15:55.420 --> 15:57.990
I mean, it seems like you guys
have it all figured out.

15:58.090 --> 16:01.193
Ca... Caleb, we don't have room
for her on the scooter.

16:01.293 --> 16:03.952
- I can drive.
- Great, let me get my jacket.

16:04.052 --> 16:06.798
Dude, what the fuck, man?
I only made reservations for 2 people.

16:06.898 --> 16:09.735
Denny, they're not even gonna give
a shit if we bring one more person.

16:09.835 --> 16:11.830
Use your brain.

16:16.141 --> 16:19.835
- I like your jacket.
- Yeah, I know. That's why I wear it.

16:22.581 --> 16:25.484
Okay. Let's go.

16:25.584 --> 16:26.885
Here.

16:26.985 --> 16:29.765
- He doesn't have a license.
- Then drive carefully.

16:30.455 --> 16:33.158
Okay. Come on, Denny.

16:33.258 --> 16:35.354
It's the way to Villisca.

16:36.128 --> 16:37.790
Shotgun.

16:39.598 --> 16:41.460
This is a nice car.

16:58.517 --> 17:02.360
So, where are we going exactly?

17:03.789 --> 17:07.893
- Villisca.
- Isn't that like a sinus medication?

17:07.992 --> 17:10.396
What? You know what I'm talking about?

17:10.496 --> 17:12.531
The axe murder house.

17:13.131 --> 17:16.377
- Everyone knows what that is.
- I'm not from here.

17:16.968 --> 17:21.066
Well, I guess that's something
that's good about you.

17:23.141 --> 17:26.444
Dude! 74 views on our last video!

17:26.545 --> 17:29.081
- I'm driving here!
- Oh.

17:29.181 --> 17:30.962
What is he talking about?

17:32.651 --> 17:35.988
We do this video ch... YouTube
Channel thing with Supernatural.

17:36.088 --> 17:39.011
MPI. We're the Maryville
Paranormal Institute...

17:39.111 --> 17:42.459
I got it. Caleb and I are...
We're ghost hunters.

17:42.559 --> 17:45.464
We hunt ghosts! Yeah.

17:45.564 --> 17:48.066
He can be a little intense about it.

17:48.166 --> 17:51.237
No, it's... it's cool.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.798
Where is everybody?

18:52.798 --> 18:54.800
They're all dead.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.869
Oh, I'm kind of not joking.

18:57.969 --> 19:01.173
Back in the day,
there was this Indian tribe here...

19:01.273 --> 19:04.276
...and they called this area "Wallisca."

19:04.776 --> 19:07.782
They used to bury their outcasts
and their insane...

19:07.882 --> 19:12.014
...in shallow graves here
so they couldn't move on.

19:12.784 --> 19:15.487
You mean like that movie "Poltergeist?"

19:15.587 --> 19:19.291
- Little girl, broken TV?
- But this is something different, Jess.

19:19.391 --> 19:22.427
8 people, 6 of them kids...

19:22.527 --> 19:25.758
...got their heads smashed in in 1912.

19:43.648 --> 19:46.711
- You scared yet?
- Totally.

19:50.255 --> 19:53.318
- Are you Denny?
- Yes, sir.

19:54.692 --> 19:56.595
I was just about to give up and go.

19:56.695 --> 20:00.219
Well, I'm so glad you didn't.
We drove all the way from Maryville.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.395
Nice house.

20:07.572 --> 20:09.468
Alright.

20:12.077 --> 20:14.740
Welcome to the Villisca axe murder house.

20:21.153 --> 20:25.818
Alright. This is the, uh, foyer.

20:27.292 --> 20:32.164
Okay, so, the murder took place
on the night of June 9th, 1912.

20:32.564 --> 20:36.134
There'd been a big gathering
at the Presbyterian church in town.

20:36.434 --> 20:38.438
They called it "Children's Day".

20:39.538 --> 20:44.109
Ever since then, this house has been marked
by an evil greater than you can imagine.

20:44.209 --> 20:47.446
People just like you have seen and heard...

20:47.546 --> 20:51.116
Um, young lady, this way.

20:51.216 --> 20:55.648
Everything will make more sense if we
start the tour from upstairs. Come along.

20:57.956 --> 21:01.560
It's believed the killer entered
the house around midnight...

21:01.660 --> 21:03.692
...climbed these very stairs...

21:12.838 --> 21:15.086
Right. This way.

21:23.982 --> 21:26.418
J.B. Moore was the first to get it.

21:33.108 --> 21:35.543
And then his wife, Sarah.

21:35.643 --> 21:40.932
Mrs. Moore was hit 35 times on the top of
her head with the blunt side of the axe.

21:41.032 --> 21:44.136
- <i>Totes crayballs.</i>
- <i>Uh, beg your pardon?</i>

21:44.436 --> 21:47.439
Let's, uh, go to the children's room.

21:47.539 --> 21:49.634
It's right down this way.

21:55.781 --> 21:57.675
Come on.

22:00.151 --> 22:02.014
<i>Follow me.</i>

22:05.357 --> 22:08.513
Herman was the oldest child, he was 11.

22:08.613 --> 22:13.225
Paul was the youngest, he was only 4.
And Boyd was the middle.

22:18.603 --> 22:22.441
Little Katherine Moore's room
was right over here.

22:22.741 --> 22:26.578
All but one of the victims
were found flat against their bed.

22:26.678 --> 22:28.907
Why is the mirror covered?

22:29.748 --> 22:32.651
Well, they found all the mirrors
covered that way the next day.

22:32.751 --> 22:37.950
The thought is that the murderer wanted
to cover 'em up before he began to kill.

22:49.901 --> 22:53.505
Hey. They caught the killer, right?

22:53.605 --> 22:57.542
No. But there was this one guy...

22:57.642 --> 23:00.145
...a traveling Presbyterian minister.

23:00.245 --> 23:04.048
- He confessed but was never...
- Reverend Lyn George Jacklin Kelly.

23:04.148 --> 23:07.318
I did my research.
We come to places like this all the time.

23:07.418 --> 23:11.323
In his confession Kelly stated that he
woke up in the middle of the night...

23:11.423 --> 23:14.793
...hearing windmills in his head.

23:14.893 --> 23:18.564
And then he went for a walk
and ended up here.

23:19.784 --> 23:22.928
Okay. Thanks. I'll just put this back.

23:23.602 --> 23:25.464
What happened to him?

23:28.139 --> 23:30.075
No one knows.

23:30.175 --> 23:34.023
But... you guys wanna see
something supercool?

23:35.113 --> 23:38.517
We have the murder weapon.

23:39.017 --> 23:41.647
Right here. Come on.

23:44.155 --> 23:49.361
That, my friends, is the actual axe itself.

23:49.961 --> 23:53.064
A one-of-a-kind piece
of bloody Iowan history...

23:53.164 --> 23:56.018
...and genuine American craftsmanship.

23:56.768 --> 23:58.597
<i>Genuine.</i>

24:01.272 --> 24:04.103
Okay. Right this way.

24:07.378 --> 24:08.974
Caleb.

24:10.648 --> 24:12.744
<i>Let me see your teeth.</i>

24:17.155 --> 24:19.017
Murder boner.

24:24.229 --> 24:27.365
This is where Lena and Ina Stillinger died.

24:27.465 --> 24:30.936
They had been guests of the Moore's that
night due to what happened to the power.

24:31.036 --> 24:32.437
- The power?
- Yeah.

24:32.537 --> 24:35.273
The electricity in the whole town
went out the night of the murders.

24:35.373 --> 24:39.939
True story. That's how
the Stillinger girls ended up here.

24:41.246 --> 24:43.282
She was found...

24:43.682 --> 24:45.784
...in the center of the room.

24:45.884 --> 24:50.649
Her underwear had been removed
and very bad things had been done to her.

24:54.175 --> 24:57.239
Let's go back to the foyer.

24:59.931 --> 25:01.866
You guys excited about Halloween?

25:01.966 --> 25:05.304
We have a big event here this year.
Real moneymaker.

25:05.904 --> 25:08.600
I think this is gonna be
our biggest year yet.

25:22.587 --> 25:26.424
<i># I'm gonna buy a paper doll #</i>

25:26.524 --> 25:29.661
<i># That I can call my own #</i>

25:30.061 --> 25:33.098
<i># A doll that other fellows #</i>

25:33.198 --> 25:35.534
<i># Cannot steal #</i>

25:35.934 --> 25:39.638
<i># And then the flirty, flirty guys #</i>

25:39.738 --> 25:43.202
<i># With their flirty, flirty eyes... ##</i>

26:04.829 --> 26:07.185
- You shouldn't be in here!
- Let go of me!

26:07.285 --> 26:10.889
Didn't you see the ropes?
Are you blind? This room is off limits!

26:10.989 --> 26:13.898
- Hey, what's your problem?
- Did you touch anything?

26:13.998 --> 26:17.375
- Are you serious?
- Alright, look, guys, the show's over.

26:17.475 --> 26:20.312
Let's go, please. That's the end of the tour.

26:21.012 --> 26:22.541
Okay.

26:25.183 --> 26:27.211
<i>Alright, let's go.</i>

27:02.153 --> 27:05.957
- Fuck.
- Denny, the tour was kind of lame.

27:06.057 --> 27:09.180
- These things are all hype anyways.
- No, we just didn't see the whole thing.

27:09.280 --> 27:12.710
We didn't see the bloody clothes, the Children's
Day mask. We didn't go in the cellar.

27:12.810 --> 27:15.408
Apparently, they take you down there
and apparently, it's fuckin' awesome.

27:15.508 --> 27:19.237
- Probably a shitload of other stuff, too.
- Denny, we can come back some other time.

27:19.337 --> 27:21.399
Did you really just say that?

27:29.781 --> 27:31.876
Why'd you jump the ropes?

27:36.087 --> 27:37.743
I heard something.

27:39.023 --> 27:41.035
- Really?
- Yeah.

27:41.135 --> 27:44.055
It was like the sound of an old
record player or something.

27:44.395 --> 27:46.424
Are you fucking with me?

27:47.599 --> 27:49.628
That sounds awesome.

27:50.935 --> 27:54.048
Yeah, well, then grandma death popped out
and scared the shit out of me, so...

27:54.148 --> 27:58.186
- She gave you like lazy eyes. Oh, my God.
- It was fuckin' scary, man.

27:58.286 --> 28:02.614
Yeah. Well, I guess we should get back
to Maryville. Finish packing.

28:03.114 --> 28:06.388
Well, maybe we could take our own tour.

28:07.745 --> 28:09.366
Later tonight?

28:09.821 --> 28:11.374
What?

28:11.474 --> 28:14.960
Yeah, we can fucking break in. I mean,
I didn't see any alarm system. Did you?

28:15.260 --> 28:17.795
- No.
- It's not that hard.

28:17.895 --> 28:21.466
My friends and I used to break into
empty houses and have parties all the time.

28:21.566 --> 28:22.834
- Really?
- Yeah.

28:22.934 --> 28:25.270
Most places are pretty easy to break into.

28:25.370 --> 28:28.139
And I bet these two fucking whackos
aren't coming back here tonight.

28:28.239 --> 28:29.841
Where would they sleep, with the mannequins?

28:29.941 --> 28:33.177
I mean, it is kind of the tour
you always wanted, Denny.

28:33.277 --> 28:34.826
Yes.

28:35.246 --> 28:38.043
Now we'll just have to wait
until it gets dark.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.460
Well, holy shit.

30:09.240 --> 30:10.702
Cool.

30:22.954 --> 30:24.783
Ladies first.

30:43.207 --> 30:45.770
Okay, follow me.

30:49.614 --> 30:51.676
Oh, shit.

31:14.172 --> 31:17.175
Oh, gosh. Watch out.

31:20.678 --> 31:23.355
- I'm going upstairs.
- Okay.

32:07.959 --> 32:09.621
<i>Weird.</i>

32:37.255 --> 32:41.293
"I survived the Villisca Axe Murder House."

32:41.993 --> 32:44.222
How do they come up with this shit?

32:45.763 --> 32:49.261
- Oh.
- Oh, thanks.

32:51.269 --> 32:55.149
And to the Republic for which it stands...

32:55.249 --> 32:57.585
...one nation under God.

33:02.613 --> 33:05.449
You know, they added that part in 1954.

33:05.549 --> 33:08.419
- Which part?
- "Under God."

33:08.519 --> 33:10.205
Oh.

33:10.305 --> 33:12.879
And who were we under before that?

33:12.979 --> 33:14.819
I don't know.

33:19.730 --> 33:22.744
Maybe we should ask the Moores.

33:23.501 --> 33:25.070
Ooh.

33:29.006 --> 33:30.502
Nice.

33:33.911 --> 33:36.647
- Oh. Geez!
- Oh, be careful.

33:36.747 --> 33:39.244
- I will. Yeah.
- You alright?

33:42.486 --> 33:44.021
One-of-a-kind?

33:46.690 --> 33:48.553
Hey, let's take a picture.

33:50.695 --> 33:52.523
Come on.

33:53.531 --> 33:55.393
Come on.

33:59.887 --> 34:00.982
Okay.

34:09.080 --> 34:11.882
- It's bright.
- Yeah.

34:12.283 --> 34:15.067
- Let me see.
- No. Um...

34:15.167 --> 34:19.090
- I... I wanna mess with it first.
- What are you doing?

34:19.389 --> 34:22.260
I'm gonna post it to Instagram. Alright?

34:23.060 --> 34:24.656
Yeah?

34:33.469 --> 34:34.748
- Hey.
- Hi, Denny.

34:34.849 --> 34:36.931
- What's up, man?
- What are you guys doing?

34:37.031 --> 34:39.904
You coming upstairs? Come on.

34:58.496 --> 35:01.599
- Shit.
- Goddamn, you are a pussy.

35:01.699 --> 35:04.989
- What are you talkin' about?
- What the fuck are you talking about?

35:05.089 --> 35:07.071
- I heard Shelly...
- Oh, fuck Shelly!

35:07.171 --> 35:10.608
She said your dick was so small
that she had to suck it with a straw.

35:10.708 --> 35:14.178
Yeah, to suck the cum
all off fuckin' every... Oh, my God.

35:14.278 --> 35:16.330
- What, what?
- Are you sure this is pot?

35:16.430 --> 35:19.501
It's top quality. I got it from Shelly.

35:20.351 --> 35:22.180
Cherry flavor.

35:25.289 --> 35:27.184
Oh, shit.

35:28.576 --> 35:30.411
No way.

35:30.661 --> 35:35.132
- What?
- Jess, she uploaded a pic.

35:35.232 --> 35:39.593
Oh, yeah? What kind of pic? Kind of
like one of those videos I put up...

35:39.693 --> 35:41.972
Oh, shit!

35:42.072 --> 35:43.901
She's with Caleb.

35:45.943 --> 35:49.300
- They're at that house in Villisca.
- What, she's on a ghost tour?

35:49.950 --> 35:52.984
- Sad, man.
- You wanna go check it out?

35:53.084 --> 35:56.134
- Not really.
- Shut up.

35:56.754 --> 35:58.556
Ow! Fuck!

35:58.656 --> 36:01.652
We got unfinished business
with that piece of shit.

Notice the concentration...

37:07.219 --> 37:11.429
...intensity on her beautiful young face.

37:12.029 --> 37:14.759
She wants to know what we all do.

37:15.399 --> 37:17.895
Where are the children?

37:21.505 --> 37:23.367
You should ask something.

37:26.277 --> 37:28.139
Come on.

37:30.548 --> 37:32.076
Okay.

37:35.453 --> 37:36.935
Ghost people...

...you wanna pull my finger?

37:40.875 --> 37:45.723
- Dude, it's supposed to be serious.
- No, it's supposed to be fun.

37:49.099 --> 37:53.185
- Denny.
- Oh... okay, let me try. Okay.

37:54.772 --> 37:57.107
You ask it a yes or no question.

37:57.207 --> 38:00.010
For these to work,
you have to hold these very still.

38:00.110 --> 38:02.580
- I'm trying.
- I know. So get it right.

38:02.680 --> 38:04.208
Okay.

38:05.783 --> 38:07.452
Okay.

38:07.852 --> 38:10.749

38:13.223 --> 38:14.852

38:20.831 --> 38:24.662
Lena, my name's Jessica.

38:28.339 --> 38:30.168
Don't be afraid.

38:35.546 --> 38:40.847
We know something really bad happened
to you here but we're not gonna hurt you.

38:48.709 --> 38:50.604
Are you there?

39:06.110 --> 39:08.379
- How much did you pay for these?
- The rods are fine.

39:08.479 --> 39:10.214
- You're doing it wrong.
- No, I'm not.

39:10.314 --> 39:13.017
Don't blame her because
your little ghost toys are broken.

39:13.117 --> 39:14.618
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you.

39:14.718 --> 39:16.887
- Okay, you just...
- You stay out of it, okay?

39:16.987 --> 39:19.156
You're not even supposed to be here tonight.

39:19.256 --> 39:21.625
Sorry, I crashed your date.

39:21.725 --> 39:23.581
Fuck you.

39:24.094 --> 39:26.730
At least I know how to keep my pants on.

39:26.830 --> 39:30.701
- Excuse me?
- Denny. Enough.

39:30.801 --> 39:34.875
What? Why are you being so protective
of sticky fingers over here?

39:34.975 --> 39:37.528
Was your bullshit video so special?

39:37.908 --> 39:42.179
Yeah, even the homos of Maryville
know all about your sad, tragic story.

39:42.279 --> 39:44.108
Fuckin' asshole!

39:52.523 --> 39:55.206
I haven't even told my parents.

39:56.193 --> 39:58.062
Are you worried about
what your parents think?

39:58.162 --> 40:00.608
- Of course.
- Mine are dead.

40:00.898 --> 40:02.400
Yeah.

40:02.900 --> 40:06.036
Diesel jack-knifed on I-80,
hit us in the back.

40:06.136 --> 40:08.172
Car flipped over, caught on fire.

40:08.272 --> 40:12.009
My mom had to push me out the back window.
Lucky fucking me.

40:12.109 --> 40:16.807
Yeah, she gets the story, Denny. We get
the story. Your parents are fuckin' dead.

40:20.951 --> 40:22.380
What?

40:25.956 --> 40:27.191
- It wasn't your fault.
- Shut up.

40:27.291 --> 40:30.494
Denny! Open the door, please.

40:30.594 --> 40:34.098
- What the fuck happened, man?
- He got all fucked up, man.

40:34.198 --> 40:36.226
He made you go with him.

40:40.738 --> 40:42.139
- Caleb.
- Shut up, Denny.

40:42.239 --> 40:43.874
You gotta listen to me.

40:43.974 --> 40:46.510
- Get up!
- <i>Your dad was messed up.</i>

40:46.610 --> 40:48.412
Shut the fuck up, Denny!

40:48.512 --> 40:52.249
You think you know anything about
my fuckin' dad, you're fuckin' clueless!

40:52.349 --> 40:54.278
He was...

40:57.721 --> 40:59.667
This is bullshit.

41:06.296 --> 41:07.858
Fuck!

41:11.201 --> 41:13.597
Fuck, it's the owners! Get up!

42:15.899 --> 42:17.328
Man.

42:23.540 --> 42:25.803
Shit, what is that?

42:27.811 --> 42:29.680
It's a mannequin.

42:33.884 --> 42:35.946
Shit... Ah!

43:19.563 --> 43:21.331
Pull it out, Connor!
Pull it out, pull it out.

43:21.431 --> 43:24.938
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry, man! You okay?
- Pull it out. Connor, pull it out!

43:25.038 --> 43:28.307
Okay. Okay. Okay, okay, I'm sorry!

43:30.734 --> 43:32.101
Here we go!

44:29.366 --> 44:31.008
Denny, come here.

44:35.155 --> 44:36.984
Is that Connor's car?

44:40.077 --> 44:42.173
What is he doing here?

45:03.801 --> 45:06.471
You must give them what they want.

45:12.976 --> 45:16.273
Yes. I'll do anything.

45:18.181 --> 45:19.650
Good.

45:39.803 --> 45:41.899
I'm so sick of that asshole.

45:46.209 --> 45:49.340
- You comin'?
- Dude, just hang here a sec.

46:24.982 --> 46:27.012
I'm sorry I slapped you.

46:34.091 --> 46:35.986
What was that?

46:36.460 --> 46:37.910
- I gotta go.
- Wait.

46:38.010 --> 46:39.863
You stay here.

46:42.099 --> 46:43.761
Caleb?

47:01.752 --> 47:03.037
Jess?

47:13.630 --> 47:15.155
Connor!

48:18.428 --> 48:19.885
<i>Fuck you.</i>

49:10.047 --> 49:13.150
Open the fucking register, now!

49:13.250 --> 49:16.420
- Alright, Dad, just be careful with...
- Shut up!

49:18.255 --> 49:21.467
- Oh, fuck.
- You guys gotta leave.

49:22.392 --> 49:25.787
- Put it down!
- Wait. I know you.

49:27.731 --> 49:29.360
Caleb.

49:30.434 --> 49:32.482
Is this a fucking joke?

49:39.076 --> 49:40.443
Dad!

50:44.074 --> 50:46.937
<i>The new girl! The new girl from Chicago!</i>

51:24.381 --> 51:27.299
"Lena, I will be your shepherd always.

51:27.851 --> 51:29.721
Reverend Kelly."

52:33.249 --> 52:34.745
Denny?

52:53.136 --> 52:56.840
<i># I'm gonna buy a paper doll #</i>

52:56.940 --> 53:00.077
<i># That I can call my own #</i>

53:00.477 --> 53:05.249
<i># A doll that other fellows cannot steal #</i>

53:06.249 --> 53:10.036
<i># And then the flirty, flirty guys #</i>

53:10.136 --> 53:13.656
<i># With their flirty, flirty eyes... ##</i>

53:28.838 --> 53:31.735
There you are. What happened?

53:34.611 --> 53:36.173
Caleb?

53:37.547 --> 53:40.644
- What?
- Did you find anyone?

53:41.885 --> 53:43.413
No.

53:46.489 --> 53:48.492
What're you doing with that machete?

53:49.092 --> 53:50.988
You gonna kill 'em?

53:53.863 --> 53:55.910
I'm sick...

53:56.010 --> 54:01.338
...of you following me around
like a lost little puppy.

54:01.438 --> 54:05.134
You need to find a new reason
to get out of bed in the morning, Denny.

54:05.775 --> 54:07.424
'Cause I'm done with you.

54:08.812 --> 54:11.514
Well... what?

54:11.614 --> 54:13.310
I get it.

54:14.884 --> 54:16.713
You're into me.

54:17.353 --> 54:19.356
You're fuckin' retarded.

54:19.956 --> 54:21.858
No, I don't think so.

54:22.959 --> 54:26.923
I've known you for six years, Caleb.

54:27.997 --> 54:30.867
Have I ever done anything to you?

54:30.967 --> 54:35.772
Not when you're drunk or lonely
or when the cops come to my house...

54:35.872 --> 54:38.836
...and I lied to them and told them
you were there all night?

54:41.478 --> 54:43.479
I'm out of here.

55:21.951 --> 55:26.016
He was just like you.

55:58.688 --> 56:00.717
But everybody lies.

56:01.824 --> 56:03.659
Nothing is safe.

56:07.697 --> 56:09.499
You promise?

56:16.106 --> 56:18.735
Caleb? Jess?

56:20.910 --> 56:22.393
Jess.

56:24.681 --> 56:27.984
Jess, what the fuck? We gotta go.

56:28.084 --> 56:30.253
- Come here.
- Connor's inside the house.

56:30.353 --> 56:31.888
We gotta find Caleb...

56:31.988 --> 56:37.053
- What are you doing? Don't...
- No. It's better to stay here.

56:38.344 --> 56:40.347
- What...
- It's safe.

56:40.447 --> 56:42.198
Jess, please.

56:42.298 --> 56:44.274
- Shh.
- No.

56:49.639 --> 56:53.074
You can pretend I'm him. Hm?

57:01.818 --> 57:04.648
Help me, Denny! I'm burning!

57:06.389 --> 57:09.426
You must miss him terribly, don't you?

57:09.926 --> 57:14.311
Don't you see, Dennis?
We're only trying to help you.

57:14.631 --> 57:17.740
We can take you to her, Dennis!

57:19.035 --> 57:23.667
Come on, Dennis!
Let us take you to her, Dennis!

57:24.881 --> 57:26.736
Oh, shit.

57:27.810 --> 57:30.513
Hey, hey. Hey. Hey, hey!
Where you going in such a hurry?

57:30.613 --> 57:34.384
- I... I don't know... Jess is...
- You're all shaken up. Are you okay?

57:35.084 --> 57:38.154
Hey, Denny, I've been meaning to tell you.
I never did get a chance to thank you...

57:38.254 --> 57:40.353
...for what you did for me.

57:41.257 --> 57:42.092
What?

57:42.192 --> 57:45.021
You know, I'd be in prison
if it wasn't for you, right?

57:47.096 --> 57:50.600
No, man. It's okay. We gotta go.
That's not important right now.

57:50.700 --> 57:53.196
- Everything's gonna be okay.
- What are you...

58:07.984 --> 58:09.752
You're an excellent kisser.

58:15.024 --> 58:18.461
Every time I saw you at school...

58:20.463 --> 58:22.479
...I imagined...

58:23.366 --> 58:26.630
...bashing your face in with a hammer.

58:27.737 --> 58:30.367
Why did you hate me so much?

58:34.644 --> 58:36.739
Because you exist.

59:03.706 --> 59:06.209
Make it stop! Make it stop!

59:06.309 --> 59:10.213
<i># I'm gonna buy a paper doll #</i>

59:10.313 --> 59:13.350
<i># That I can call my own #</i>

59:13.750 --> 59:16.837
<i># A doll that other fellows #</i>

59:16.937 --> 59:19.489
<i># Cannot steal #</i>

59:19.589 --> 59:23.421

01:00:04.834 --> 01:00:07.291
Oh. Well, look at you.

01:00:07.971 --> 01:00:11.028
All cleaned up after today's festivities.

01:00:11.908 --> 01:00:15.445
I brought you a sweet.

01:00:53.416 --> 01:00:56.079
Dad? Dad?

01:00:58.621 --> 01:01:00.216
It's good to see you.

01:01:08.798 --> 01:01:10.460
Dennis.

01:01:21.677 --> 01:01:23.206
Mom.

01:01:26.883 --> 01:01:28.467
Take this.

01:01:28.567 --> 01:01:30.230
Ah!

01:01:31.254 --> 01:01:33.324
This is in you!

01:01:34.824 --> 01:01:36.892
This is who you are!

01:01:38.961 --> 01:01:41.565
You must accept it.

01:01:42.165 --> 01:01:44.717
Dad! Just do what he fuckin' says, Matt!

01:01:46.569 --> 01:01:49.599
No! No, stop!

01:01:50.957 --> 01:01:53.459
This is... this is who you are.

01:01:53.559 --> 01:01:55.328
No! Stop!

01:02:26.542 --> 01:02:28.578
It's time, Caleb.

01:02:44.326 --> 01:02:46.769
- Son.
- Huh?

01:03:21.247 --> 01:03:22.775
Mom.

01:03:24.266 --> 01:03:27.330
Yes, it's me.

01:03:47.289 --> 01:03:49.752
There will be beauty here now...

01:03:51.193 --> 01:03:53.026
...because of you.

01:03:59.869 --> 01:04:01.704
Your father...

01:04:01.804 --> 01:04:04.467
...would be so proud.

01:04:16.252 --> 01:04:19.088
I've missed you so much.

01:04:19.488 --> 01:04:22.118
And I've missed you, too, Dennis.

01:04:25.327 --> 01:04:27.624
We can be together again.

01:04:29.765 --> 01:04:31.627
You know how.

01:04:35.905 --> 01:04:38.134
You've thought of it before.

01:04:41.377 --> 01:04:43.239
Do it.

01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:46.442
Do it.

01:04:47.650 --> 01:04:49.512
Do it, Dennis.

01:06:14.403 --> 01:06:16.072
No!

01:06:16.572 --> 01:06:19.549
No! No! No!

01:06:26.982 --> 01:06:29.845
What's happening to me?

01:06:35.457 --> 01:06:37.576
Everything here is a lie.

01:06:37.676 --> 01:06:39.906
Stop, Ina!

01:07:01.217 --> 01:07:03.219
This place twists you.

01:07:03.619 --> 01:07:05.455
It changes you.

01:07:05.955 --> 01:07:07.817
It feeds our insanity...

01:07:09.191 --> 01:07:11.020
...our tragedy...

01:07:12.161 --> 01:07:14.056
...and regret.

01:07:15.231 --> 01:07:17.747
The Lord has delivered you unto me...

01:07:17.847 --> 01:07:21.671
...and I will take thine head from thee!

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:23.238
Jess. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Jess.

01:08:23.339 --> 01:08:25.868
- Jess.
- It was all my doing!

01:08:25.968 --> 01:08:29.372
My darkness! My dirtiness!

01:08:30.477 --> 01:08:33.772
- Kill me! Do it now!
- Jess?

01:08:34.354 --> 01:08:36.478
- Kill me!
- No!

01:08:36.578 --> 01:08:39.999
We're trapped here because
you refuse to see the truth.

01:08:40.129 --> 01:08:42.167
Lies! Lies!

01:08:42.267 --> 01:08:46.042
I am dirty! Dirty and broken!

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:53.390
You are not the one who did this to me.

01:08:57.566 --> 01:08:59.234
No!

01:09:15.917 --> 01:09:19.214
Come here. Jess, don't.
Come on. I'm right here.

01:09:20.622 --> 01:09:23.906
Look at me, come here! Come here!
Jess! Look in my eyes.

01:09:24.006 --> 01:09:27.630
Jess! Look at me. Come here.
Come here! Jess! Jess!

01:09:27.729 --> 01:09:31.116
You look in my eyes. Look in my eyes
right now. Look in my eyes. Come on.

01:09:31.216 --> 01:09:34.603
Look at me. Look at me, Jess! Come on.
Come on. There you go. There you go.

01:09:34.703 --> 01:09:38.555
Look at me. Look at me. There you go.
I'm right here. I'm right here.

01:09:38.656 --> 01:09:41.443
There you go. I'm right here.

01:09:41.542 --> 01:09:44.013
There you go. Come on, there you go.

01:09:44.113 --> 01:09:45.274
Caleb.

01:10:00.459 --> 01:10:02.398
You're the Devil!

01:10:16.078 --> 01:10:18.768
Connor, don't! Connor!

01:10:19.648 --> 01:10:22.084
Stick it in, boy!

01:10:25.153 --> 01:10:27.749
No! No!

01:10:32.261 --> 01:10:34.330
I was born before your Gods.

01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:38.554
Living in the never-ending shadows
of your sweet, black...

01:10:38.944 --> 01:10:40.750
...misery!

01:10:56.985 --> 01:10:58.621
Enough!

01:11:44.266 --> 01:11:46.562
When are you coming to bed?

01:11:47.836 --> 01:11:49.905
Now just close your eyes, Ina.

01:11:50.605 --> 01:11:52.101
Okay.

01:11:53.609 --> 01:11:55.905
It's time for us to leave.

01:12:18.534 --> 01:12:20.403
I'm sorry.

01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:14.656
Fuck, okay.

01:13:14.756 --> 01:13:16.118
Here.

01:13:21.263 --> 01:13:23.265
- Okay. We gotta go.
- Listen to me, listen to me.

01:13:23.365 --> 01:13:25.901
- Come on, we gotta go.
- Listen, you guys were never here.

01:13:26.001 --> 01:13:27.202
- What do mean?
- You gotta go.

01:13:27.302 --> 01:13:29.071
- No, man.
- No, we're not leaving you, Caleb.

01:13:29.171 --> 01:13:31.507
They need a reason not
to come looking for all of us.

01:13:31.607 --> 01:13:33.318
Caleb.

01:13:34.042 --> 01:13:36.211
- Caleb.
- Come on, Denny.

01:13:36.311 --> 01:13:37.859
- Caleb, come on.
- Just help me.

01:13:37.959 --> 01:13:40.695
- Come on.
- Come on, Jess.

01:13:40.795 --> 01:13:42.641
- Let's go.
- Wait.

01:15:11.506 --> 01:15:13.735
There's nothing here.

01:15:14.142 --> 01:15:16.238
There's nothing here!
