01:05.433 --> 01:06.699
Asa?

01:06.700 --> 01:07.867
Yes, Mrs. Harris?

01:07.868 --> 01:09.770
Where's Pernell?

01:11.872 --> 01:13.506
- Judge Harris...
- Judge Harris...

01:13.507 --> 01:15.987
Judge Harris, is it true that
you've been seeing a neurologist?

01:16.244 --> 01:17.910
Bloodsucking vultures.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.847
Hey, Pernell, you look
like you could use a laugh.

01:20.848 --> 01:24.384
So there's this guy Johnson,
who's going to prison.

01:24.385 --> 01:26.586
So he's rattled
because he's heard stories

01:26.587 --> 01:28.321
of what happens to people
like him in there.

01:28.322 --> 01:30.857
He gets his jumpsuit.
He gets his blanket,

01:30.858 --> 01:32.392
and he gets his toothbrush.

01:32.393 --> 01:35.395
And then... his worst nightmare.

01:35.396 --> 01:36.996
They throw him into a cell

01:36.997 --> 01:38.998
with this big-ass dude
named Bubba.

01:38.999 --> 01:40.501
So Bubba says...

01:41.735 --> 01:43.069
"We're gonna play house

01:43.070 --> 01:44.337
"in this cell.

01:44.338 --> 01:46.173
"Do you want to be the mommy,

01:46.174 --> 01:48.408
or do you want to be the daddy?"

01:48.409 --> 01:50.577
And Johnson sees a way out.

01:50.578 --> 01:55.315
He puffs up his chest and says
"I want to be the daddy."

01:55.316 --> 01:59.186
And Bubba says, "Okay, Daddy."

01:59.187 --> 02:00.953
"Well, come on over here

02:00.954 --> 02:02.856
and suck Mama's dick."

02:05.426 --> 02:06.926
Fresh fish, ladies.

02:06.927 --> 02:08.561
Fresh fish.

02:08.562 --> 02:12.366
Tap your brakes, judge.
Eating for two.

03:29.643 --> 03:32.312
Mr. Harris, you're being charged

03:32.313 --> 03:36.583
with violating Penal Code
section 1210.7

03:36.584 --> 03:38.451
for electronic monitoring.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.587
That's why your parole
officer had you arrested.

03:40.588 --> 03:43.122
Do you understand the charges
brought against you?

03:43.123 --> 03:44.291
Yes, I do.

03:44.292 --> 03:45.692
Do you wish
to contest the charge?

03:45.693 --> 03:47.159
- Yes, I do.
- All right.

03:47.160 --> 03:51.298
We'll set it for hearing
for Monday...

03:51.299 --> 03:52.299
the 29th.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.800
Thank you, Your Honor.

03:53.801 --> 03:56.736
The people call for revocation
of bail, Your Honor.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.371
- Granted.
- Hold on just a second.

03:58.372 --> 04:00.307
Prisoner is remanded
into custody.

04:00.308 --> 04:01.641
I'm going to spend
three days in jail?

04:01.642 --> 04:03.943
- Your Honor, we can't do this now?
- Pernell.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.978
The court is not going
to adjust its calendar

04:05.979 --> 04:07.380
to suit you, Mr. Harris.

04:07.381 --> 04:09.849
Judge Harris!

04:09.850 --> 04:12.852
As a colleague,
I think you owe me that.

04:12.853 --> 04:16.623
My colleagues don't wear
ankle monitors, Mr. Harris.

04:16.624 --> 04:19.392
Now, you can either take Monday,

04:19.392 --> 04:21.462
or we can do it
two weeks from now.

04:25.699 --> 04:26.800
Monday?

04:28.168 --> 04:29.570
That's what I thought.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.709
Don't look at me like that.

04:36.710 --> 04:39.045
You want a pat on the back?

04:39.046 --> 04:42.014
She said I'm gonna have to
stew in jail for three days,

04:42.015 --> 04:43.350
and you say thank you?

04:43.351 --> 04:45.585
Were you expecting something
different out there?

04:45.586 --> 04:47.687
Yeah. I was expecting you to
get the hearing set for today

04:47.688 --> 04:49.889
so I could have slept
in my own fucking bed.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.525
You're like a piñata.
They hit you with a stick,

04:52.526 --> 04:53.926
and you still shit candy.

04:53.927 --> 04:54.994
It doesn't matter.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.929
You're not getting
your bail reinstated.

04:56.930 --> 04:57.997
You don't know that.

04:57.998 --> 05:00.500
They have pictures of you
on the Bay Bridge.

05:00.501 --> 05:03.570
Pernell, we're going to lose.

05:03.571 --> 05:05.271
Don't...
Don't wave that flag yet.

05:05.272 --> 05:07.774
I could tell them I had an
important reason for leaving.

05:07.775 --> 05:09.409
I didn't have time
to get permission.

05:09.410 --> 05:11.878
I'm not talking about
the parole violation.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.480
They have motive.

05:13.481 --> 05:14.981
You think Caldwell raped
your daughter-in-law.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.215
I know he did.

05:16.216 --> 05:18.284
They have your DNA
on Caldwell's body.

05:18.285 --> 05:19.752
Then they have an eyewitness

05:19.753 --> 05:22.254
that saw you dragging it
into Julio Farkas' backyard.

05:22.255 --> 05:23.423
Pernell, it's all
about perception.

05:23.424 --> 05:25.091
Now, I'm going to say this,

05:25.092 --> 05:26.258
and then I'm going to duck.

05:26.259 --> 05:27.794
On the flip side,

05:27.795 --> 05:30.162
there are dozens of people,
including doctors,

05:30.163 --> 05:32.732
that would be willing to say
you're not yourself,

05:32.733 --> 05:37.404
that you were delusional,
psychotic, even.

05:37.405 --> 05:40.540
On the flip side, I didn't
fucking murder anybody, Adam.

05:40.541 --> 05:41.808
They got no weapon.

05:41.809 --> 05:44.210
We could poke holes in the DNA.

05:44.211 --> 05:45.945
They got a guy said
he saw me dump a body,

05:45.946 --> 05:47.414
but he didn't see me murder one.

05:47.415 --> 05:49.215
It's all circumstantial, Adam!

05:49.216 --> 05:51.784
I don't see why you're
looking to pull the rip cord!

05:51.785 --> 05:53.019
Because we're free falling,

05:53.020 --> 05:54.487
and I wouldn't be
doing my job if I...

05:54.488 --> 05:56.188
Doing your job?
Like you did it in there?

05:56.189 --> 05:58.791
If you weren't such a
toothless cocker spaniel...

05:58.792 --> 05:59.927
That's it!

06:01.061 --> 06:03.430
Just tell me where I can
send the files.

06:03.431 --> 06:05.432
- Guard!
- Adam, come on.

06:05.433 --> 06:07.199
Come on, sit down.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.570
Find yourself another piñata.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.245
Fuck.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.867
Jocelyn.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.068
Yeah.

06:42.069 --> 06:45.038
I asked you if you'd been
socializing at all.

06:51.945 --> 06:53.881
I guess. Yes. I don't know.

06:54.982 --> 06:57.116
You don't know?

06:57.117 --> 06:59.486
We talked about it.

06:59.487 --> 07:00.820
Now you're to the point

07:00.821 --> 07:03.056
where you don't even
come into my office.

07:04.324 --> 07:06.660
Yeah. I know. Um...

07:11.364 --> 07:13.033
I, um...

07:14.835 --> 07:17.505
I feel like I'm being watched.

07:18.539 --> 07:19.606
By who?

07:19.607 --> 07:24.210
By you, by Asa,

07:24.211 --> 07:26.713
by the mailman,

07:26.714 --> 07:28.815
my neighbors, my dog.

07:28.816 --> 07:30.717
I feel like the whole fucking
world has an eye on me.

07:30.718 --> 07:33.052
That's all.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.287
Shh! Stop! Stop!

07:35.288 --> 07:37.289
Moonlight, no! No!

07:37.290 --> 07:39.025
God damn it!

07:39.026 --> 07:41.529
God fucking damn it, Moonlight!

07:44.131 --> 07:45.632
I'm sorry.

07:45.633 --> 07:48.035
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

07:50.571 --> 07:51.804
Have you given any thought

07:51.805 --> 07:53.873
to the exposure therapy
I told you about?

07:53.874 --> 07:56.208
Yeah, I'm thinking
about it, okay?

07:56.209 --> 07:58.145
I'm still thinking about it.

08:01.549 --> 08:03.551
Still sleeping in your car?

08:06.453 --> 08:07.754
What did Hoverman say?

08:07.755 --> 08:10.256
Hoverman sat in jail
with his thumb up his ass

08:10.257 --> 08:13.693
for three weeks after you
charged him with contempt.

08:13.694 --> 08:16.796
Remember? So yeah.
He's not interested.

08:16.797 --> 08:18.297
How about Melnick?

08:18.298 --> 08:19.832
How about Johnnie Cochran,

08:19.833 --> 08:22.134
so long as we're
talking dead guys?

08:22.135 --> 08:23.736
How about Schulz?

08:23.737 --> 08:26.072
How about digging the shit
out of your ears?

08:26.073 --> 08:28.407
Rieder's the only
decent lawyer in town

08:28.408 --> 08:30.677
willing to defend you.

08:30.678 --> 08:32.578
Make that was.

08:32.580 --> 08:35.782
You think you can
sweet talk him back?

08:35.783 --> 08:37.116
I'll think of something.

08:38.451 --> 08:40.620
Kessler came by with an address.

08:40.621 --> 08:43.056
Said you'd know what it was for.

08:54.234 --> 08:57.303
Make sure you can get that to
Keith Dennison, understand?

08:57.304 --> 08:58.938
You're killing me, Pernell.

08:58.939 --> 09:01.741
Make sure he doesn't do the
same thing with that witness.

09:01.742 --> 09:03.109
Let the money do the talking,

09:03.110 --> 09:04.845
not his fucking knife,
you understand?

09:08.515 --> 09:09.516
Guard.

09:17.024 --> 09:19.258
Hey, black guys,

09:19.259 --> 09:20.927
you seen my capsule?

09:20.928 --> 09:23.631
I'm looking for my capsule.
I got to find my capsule.

09:27.467 --> 09:29.069
You going to eat both of those?

09:42.816 --> 09:45.185
Yeah. That's a good one.

09:46.386 --> 09:47.821
You want a taste?

09:49.857 --> 09:51.191
I'm allergic.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.425
How long, man?

09:53.426 --> 09:55.327
67 days.

09:55.328 --> 09:57.197
Swore to God.

09:58.465 --> 10:00.801
One day at a time, sweet Jesus.

10:01.735 --> 10:05.104
Hey, chef, you seen my capsule?

10:05.105 --> 10:06.205
Get out.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.774
Go on, be that way.

10:07.775 --> 10:09.877
Major Tom don't care.

10:11.712 --> 10:14.081
Uno Mundo, my butt!

10:18.285 --> 10:19.819
How'd you know I was here?

10:19.820 --> 10:21.553
Pernell asked me to put an alert

10:21.554 --> 10:22.922
on your Jones account.

10:22.923 --> 10:27.126
I get notifications
every time you order.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.661
What did you get?

10:28.662 --> 10:29.897
Honey.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.131
So he knows I'm back.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.266
Not yet.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.102
You going to let me in?

10:36.103 --> 10:37.970
If Pernell stopped on a dime,

10:37.971 --> 10:39.939
it would take a day and a half

10:39.940 --> 10:41.841
to dig cheap Toby
out of his ass.

10:41.842 --> 10:44.310
Why did he go to San Francisco
in the first place?

10:44.311 --> 10:45.645
I don't know.

10:47.380 --> 10:48.948
Is he going to get out?

10:48.949 --> 10:51.217
Not if he doesn't get
a new lawyer.

10:51.218 --> 10:52.985
Rieder's quit.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.387
Nobody in this town
wants the gig.

10:55.388 --> 10:57.456
He's made a lot of enemies
over the years.

10:57.457 --> 11:00.927
And he's helped
a lot of people, too.

11:00.928 --> 11:03.330
Some forget too soon.

11:04.732 --> 11:06.432
Look, Randy,

11:06.433 --> 11:08.134
I don't mean to rush you,

11:08.135 --> 11:10.102
but I have a guest
coming for lunch,

11:10.103 --> 11:12.805
and I would really
like to be ready.

11:12.806 --> 11:17.309
Well, maybe after lunch
you could go see him.

11:17.310 --> 11:19.045
It would be good.

11:19.046 --> 11:22.849
You don't have to love him.
Just show up.

11:22.850 --> 11:25.617
He needs someone
to talk sense into him.

11:25.618 --> 11:26.819
He needs his wife.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.388
He has two wives.

11:30.623 --> 11:32.760
Why don't you ask the other one?

11:36.964 --> 11:39.565
If you didn't come back
for Pernell,

11:39.566 --> 11:41.168
why are you here?

11:42.335 --> 11:45.205
For my son. For PJ.

11:49.777 --> 11:51.945
My God.

12:10.898 --> 12:14.134
Pacific Sage raw honeycomb.

12:15.435 --> 12:16.469
This is singular.

12:17.537 --> 12:19.038
I thought you'd like it.

12:19.039 --> 12:21.407
Consider it my way
of saying thank you

12:21.408 --> 12:25.711
for making lunch
on such short notice.

12:25.712 --> 12:27.579
Honestly, I was curious.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.615
Didn't even know
you were in town.

12:29.616 --> 12:31.617
Just got back this morning.

12:31.618 --> 12:32.618
Just to see me?

12:32.619 --> 12:34.121
In a way.

12:40.160 --> 12:43.129
Have you filled
Anne Wu's position?

12:43.130 --> 12:45.331
Narrowed down the applicants,

12:45.332 --> 12:48.167
but if you know anyone,
it's not too late.

12:48.168 --> 12:50.270
I do. Me.

12:51.905 --> 12:53.840
Crystal, this is going
to sound worse than it is,

12:53.841 --> 12:55.507
but when people join
Brooks Innovations,

12:55.508 --> 12:58.210
their job comes first.
There is no second.

12:58.211 --> 13:02.148
I hire hungry people
who I can shape and inspire.

13:02.149 --> 13:05.117
Actually, that sounds
like age discrimination

13:05.118 --> 13:07.854
or... wishful thinking.

13:07.855 --> 13:10.056
No. Age is not an issue.

13:10.057 --> 13:12.424
I just want blank slates,

13:12.425 --> 13:16.096
people not distracted
by all the little big things.

13:17.397 --> 13:21.067
By that you mean
my husband's legal problems?

13:21.068 --> 13:23.871
That would qualify
as a big big thing.

13:27.240 --> 13:31.011
Mayor Boston, care to comment
on Pernell Harris' arrest?

13:32.012 --> 13:33.379
Ahem.

13:33.380 --> 13:35.347
All right, all right.
What a good turnout.

13:35.348 --> 13:38.184
What a good turnout.
What's the latest on Pernell?

13:38.185 --> 13:41.353
His bail revocation
hearing was set for Monday,

13:41.354 --> 13:43.489
so he's at least
in custody till then.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.458
And his lawyer quit.

13:47.227 --> 13:48.095
Okay.

13:48.096 --> 13:49.962
All right, all right.

13:49.963 --> 13:51.563
Good to see you.

13:51.564 --> 13:52.565
Hey.

13:53.901 --> 13:55.367
What a turnout. What a turnout.

13:55.368 --> 13:57.403
I want to thank
all of you for coming.

13:57.404 --> 13:58.437
Thank you so much.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.172
Now, many of you know

14:00.173 --> 14:02.909
I'm a proud Harris High
Dragon class of '86.

14:02.910 --> 14:04.310
Oo-ooh!

14:04.311 --> 14:05.711
Oo-ooh!

14:05.712 --> 14:08.948
Yes. I'm proud to be standing
in front of my alma mater

14:08.949 --> 14:11.750
to announce the launch
of the Real Initiative.

14:11.751 --> 14:15.054
This is a fully funded program
that will start next fall

14:15.055 --> 14:17.089
with five of our most
challenged schools,

14:17.090 --> 14:19.927
beginning with
Eli Harris High School.

14:21.261 --> 14:24.263
That's right. That's right.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.132
Today you're going
to be hearing a speech,

14:26.133 --> 14:27.533
but it won't be from me

14:27.534 --> 14:29.936
because the Real Initiative
isn't for me

14:29.937 --> 14:33.739
or any of my boring friends
and fellow colleagues up here.

14:33.740 --> 14:34.974
It's for you.

14:34.975 --> 14:37.143
It gives me great pride

14:37.144 --> 14:39.946
to introduce your
Student Body President.

14:39.947 --> 14:41.614
Mr. Freddie Hampton.

14:43.984 --> 14:46.353
Try not to upstage
Mayor Boston, all right?

14:47.820 --> 14:49.089
Speak on it.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.959
They say they're going
to fix this school.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.126
- Yeah.
- Right.

14:54.127 --> 14:56.462
New books, new paint,
new technology.

14:56.463 --> 14:58.330
- That's right.
- It's a dream come true.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.232
I mean, it's been 50 years

15:00.233 --> 15:02.969
since Martin Luther King
said "I have a dream,"

15:02.970 --> 15:05.038
but what's really changed?

15:06.373 --> 15:07.974
Not when native people get

15:07.975 --> 15:09.375
the same nightmare
they've always had,

15:09.376 --> 15:11.777
a nightmare that the truth
about black people

15:11.778 --> 15:15.281
and the endless mechanism of degradation
and oppression under which we suffer

15:15.282 --> 15:17.616
hasn't reached Eli Harris High.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.585
A living nightmare.

15:19.586 --> 15:23.189
When we look at our reading
list for American Lit,

15:23.190 --> 15:25.657
you know, they still want us
to read Uncle Tom's Cabin.

15:25.658 --> 15:29.029
Lawd bless ye, yeah!

15:30.530 --> 15:34.066
These critters ain't
like white folks, you know.

15:34.067 --> 15:36.302
They gets over things.

15:36.303 --> 15:37.536
Nah.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.605
I have a nightmare every time
I hear the word "real."

15:39.606 --> 15:42.908
Ahem. Okay, who picked
Malcolm X Junior to speak?

15:42.909 --> 15:44.910
How can we keep it real

15:44.911 --> 15:46.912
when Eli Harris High,
the very school

15:46.913 --> 15:48.914
we're taught to respect
and compete for,

15:48.915 --> 15:51.383
the school that wants
our undying loyalty,

15:51.384 --> 15:55.021
is named after a devout
racist and segregationist?

15:55.022 --> 15:56.455
Look, Eli Harris said,

15:56.456 --> 16:00.027
"History and science have
returned an irrefutable fact.

16:01.028 --> 16:03.429
"Colored people
lack the aptitude

16:03.430 --> 16:05.565
to learn at a normal rate."

16:09.402 --> 16:11.870
You know, if it was left
to our school's namesake,

16:11.871 --> 16:13.739
80% of us wouldn't even be here.

16:13.740 --> 16:16.275
- Man.
- Yes, but we are here.

16:16.276 --> 16:19.145
We are here, and change
is about to happen.

16:19.146 --> 16:21.213
- We are here.
- Look, you want to keep it real?

16:21.214 --> 16:23.249
- Change the name.
- Yeah!

16:23.250 --> 16:24.883
- Change the name!
- Yeah!

16:24.884 --> 16:26.285
Change the name!

16:26.286 --> 16:29.221
Change the name!
Change the name!

16:29.222 --> 16:31.923
Change the name!
Change the name!

16:31.924 --> 16:34.660
Change the name!
Change the name!

16:34.661 --> 16:36.095
- Change the name!
- Thank you for coming.

16:36.096 --> 16:37.463
Thank you so much
for coming out.

16:37.464 --> 16:40.199
Change the name!
Change the name!

16:40.200 --> 16:42.868
Change the name!
Change the name!

16:42.869 --> 16:45.137
Change the name!
Change the name!

16:45.138 --> 16:46.338
Change the name!

16:46.339 --> 16:47.639
Going to change the name, Mayor?

16:47.640 --> 16:50.077
- Gonna change the name?
- Please, no comment.

16:52.145 --> 16:53.580
How you doing, judge?

16:56.516 --> 16:57.584
I'm in jail.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.786
Yeah.

17:00.787 --> 17:02.321
I know it's hard, man.

17:02.322 --> 17:03.755
Just, take refuge in knowing

17:03.756 --> 17:06.726
that God loves everyone,
even cop killers.

17:10.997 --> 17:13.732
You want to know
what I think about God?

17:13.733 --> 17:15.702
He's full of this.

17:29.549 --> 17:33.652
You think the Almighty lacks
the power to set you free?

17:33.653 --> 17:38.624
Well, the, keys
to the Kingdom of Heaven,

17:38.625 --> 17:40.626
they hardly work
in this shit hole.

17:40.627 --> 17:42.828
Ye of little faith.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.131
Fuck you!

17:46.199 --> 17:48.635
Guard! Guard!

17:51.304 --> 17:53.972
- Guard!
- They don't care about you.

17:53.973 --> 17:55.442
He does.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.713
You blasphemous doubting Thomas.

18:01.781 --> 18:02.848
Do you believe

18:02.849 --> 18:05.884
in the power and the glory

18:05.885 --> 18:07.153
of the Almighty?

18:07.154 --> 18:08.688
Here's my fucking answer.

18:14.294 --> 18:15.861
- You want God to save you?
- Go to hell!

18:15.862 --> 18:17.496
You poor stupid soul.

18:17.497 --> 18:20.232
You don't believe in God?

18:20.233 --> 18:22.202
Who's going to save you?

18:30.943 --> 18:32.411
Of this world,

18:32.412 --> 18:34.346
and with that he could reach...

18:34.347 --> 18:36.415
Don't tell me you think
that means something.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.250
Did you catch the part

18:38.251 --> 18:40.719
where he's talking about
men becoming too powerful,

18:40.720 --> 18:43.255
how they start thinking
like the devil?

18:43.256 --> 18:44.490
No, I never heard him say that.

18:44.491 --> 18:46.892
All I heard was some
woman talking crazy

18:46.893 --> 18:48.194
in the middle of her orgasm.

18:48.195 --> 18:50.529
She was translating his tongues.

18:50.530 --> 18:52.231
That something is
going on with Pernell.

18:52.232 --> 18:55.302
Okay, look, just lose it
permanently.

18:59.406 --> 19:00.607
- Ma'am...
- That's okay.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.411
How are you doing, Valerie?

19:05.678 --> 19:07.346
Not a good day,

19:07.347 --> 19:11.250
but, hopefully you can
make it a bit brighter.

19:11.251 --> 19:12.784
Pernell. Look,

19:12.785 --> 19:14.486
the spotlight on Pernell
it too bright right now.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.488
It's not about Pernell.

19:16.489 --> 19:20.460
I heard what transpired
today at your alma mater.

19:21.861 --> 19:24.463
And you...

19:24.464 --> 19:26.332
You care more about
some school protest

19:26.333 --> 19:27.466
than Pernell bring in jail?

19:27.467 --> 19:29.901
My nephew sowed his seeds.

19:29.902 --> 19:31.703
We shall see what he reaps.

19:31.704 --> 19:35.774
But the Harris family legacy
is bigger than him.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.309
That is my concern.

19:37.310 --> 19:39.245
Yeah. I understand.

19:39.246 --> 19:42.047
Do you know what my
favorite book is, Robbie?

19:42.048 --> 19:44.351
Let me guess.

19:45.985 --> 19:47.453
Uncle Tom's Cabin.

19:47.454 --> 19:49.555
The Great Gatsby.

19:49.556 --> 19:53.359
The novel is quite beautiful.

19:53.360 --> 19:56.395
A man, desperate to belong,

19:56.396 --> 19:59.698
trying hard
to reinvent his past.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.167
You know, maybe I should
check it out again,

20:02.168 --> 20:04.135
catch the movie or something.

20:04.136 --> 20:05.371
What you should have checked out

20:05.372 --> 20:06.772
was that young man's speech

20:06.773 --> 20:09.207
before he gave it,
don't you think?

20:09.208 --> 20:11.478
Or maybe he had your blessing.

20:13.780 --> 20:17.283
Well, maybe someone should have
vetted your grandfather's speech,

20:17.284 --> 20:20.753
cut out the part where he
said black people are stupid.

20:22.622 --> 20:25.090
This is all about
some fired-up kid

20:25.091 --> 20:26.325
popping up at the gums,

20:26.326 --> 20:28.394
trying to increase
his social media status,

20:28.395 --> 20:29.795
maybe sell a couple of T-shirts.

20:29.796 --> 20:32.197
That's how they
protest nowadays.

20:32.198 --> 20:34.433
This will all blow over,
I promise you.

20:34.434 --> 20:36.468
I hope so, Robbie,

20:36.469 --> 20:43.208
because I truly feel
that your family is one of us.

20:43.209 --> 20:45.011
Understood.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.742
Okay.

21:16.976 --> 21:19.812
Please, God,
just let him take the money.

21:22.181 --> 21:23.850
Take the money.

21:38.230 --> 21:39.366
You okay?

21:40.867 --> 21:42.369
Fuck.

21:47.640 --> 21:48.841
No.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.062
Crys.

22:23.275 --> 22:24.543
When'd you get back?

22:24.544 --> 22:25.878
This morning.

22:35.555 --> 22:36.922
What happened?

22:36.923 --> 22:38.690
You know,

22:38.691 --> 22:41.326
I was just finishing up
my scotch at the Court Club

22:41.327 --> 22:46.331
when SVPD's Finest
comes in with a warrant.

22:46.332 --> 22:47.866
Guess I should have left sooner.

22:47.867 --> 22:51.003
I kept thinking you'd show.

22:53.072 --> 22:55.574
- You look tired.
- Well, what can I say?

22:55.575 --> 22:58.043
It was a tough day.

22:58.044 --> 23:00.279
Why did you go to San Francisco?

23:02.048 --> 23:03.450
What?

23:05.652 --> 23:07.185
Pernell, are you okay?

23:07.186 --> 23:08.821
The CO gave me a beat-down.

23:10.490 --> 23:12.323
Everybody just let it happen.

23:12.324 --> 23:14.560
You cannot do anything
to incur...

23:14.561 --> 23:16.662
Do you think
I provoked this, Crys?

23:16.663 --> 23:18.964
They think I'm a cop killer.

23:18.965 --> 23:20.766
That's why I got to get
the hell out of here.

23:20.767 --> 23:22.702
Who's your new lawyer?

23:24.571 --> 23:26.605
I haven't figured that out yet.

23:26.606 --> 23:28.039
The hearing's in two days.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.041
I... I'll represent myself
at the hearing.

23:30.042 --> 23:31.342
You're gonna rep...

23:31.343 --> 23:33.344
How many people have done
that in your courtroom?

23:33.345 --> 23:34.746
- Did they win?
- Crys,

23:34.747 --> 23:36.181
I know the law, okay?

23:36.182 --> 23:38.517
I... I fucking wrote the law.

23:38.518 --> 23:40.686
Pernell, look at yourself.

23:40.687 --> 23:42.854
Look what you're wearing.

23:42.855 --> 23:45.825
You're not special anymore.

23:51.197 --> 23:53.164
Hey.

23:53.165 --> 23:54.365
Come on back.

23:54.366 --> 23:57.036
No. I'll make it quick.

23:58.337 --> 24:00.105
My husband is heading to prison

24:00.106 --> 24:01.172
for murder,

24:01.173 --> 24:02.774
and my son is dead.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.910
You say you need a blank slate?

24:04.911 --> 24:07.580
I need something I can
pour my life into.

24:11.518 --> 24:13.351
Come back tomorrow at 9 a.m.

24:13.352 --> 24:14.754
Okay.

24:17.524 --> 24:19.526
And wear jeans.

24:41.748 --> 24:43.182
What do you want?

25:37.303 --> 25:38.704
Quiet.

25:38.705 --> 25:42.208
Fuck, quiet, Moonlight, please.

25:48.615 --> 25:50.683
What is it?
What do you see? What?

26:00.860 --> 26:02.895
It's nothing.
It's just the wind.

26:04.831 --> 26:07.232
Fuck. Stop barking, God damn it.

26:07.233 --> 26:08.735
Stop barking!

26:11.137 --> 26:13.772
My God. My God, I'm so sorry.

26:13.773 --> 26:14.941
I'm sorry. Come here.

26:15.842 --> 26:17.242
God, I'm so sorry.

26:17.243 --> 26:18.343
I'm sorry.

26:18.344 --> 26:20.278
I'm so sorry.

26:20.279 --> 26:22.048
Come on. I'm so sorry.

26:24.050 --> 26:25.050
Come here.

26:35.061 --> 26:37.195
I'm the only one
adding names to the list.

26:37.196 --> 26:38.798
You need to pitch in.

26:40.667 --> 26:42.268
Pedro.

26:43.335 --> 26:44.971
Pedro Stoljnak?

26:46.238 --> 26:47.572
I don't think so.

26:47.573 --> 26:50.375
Joke, Dawn. Joke.

26:50.376 --> 26:51.677
Sandy.

26:51.678 --> 26:52.744
Sandy's great

26:52.745 --> 26:53.912
if you want people to think

26:53.913 --> 26:55.280
he's some kind of homo.

26:55.281 --> 26:57.249
Eddie, get serious.

26:58.851 --> 27:00.686
What about Paul?

27:00.687 --> 27:03.022
I always liked Paul
as a boy's name.

27:04.824 --> 27:07.058
We will add it to the list.

27:07.059 --> 27:08.493
Did you take your prenatals?

27:08.494 --> 27:09.695
And my vitamin D.

27:09.696 --> 27:10.729
Great.

27:10.730 --> 27:13.032
What about Alfred?

27:14.734 --> 27:16.969
Big Al. I like it.

27:23.743 --> 27:25.410
How many of those sandwiches

27:25.411 --> 27:26.712
can she eat in one day?

27:26.713 --> 27:27.914
She's a machine.

27:39.025 --> 27:40.191
Hey.

27:40.192 --> 27:41.259
Hi.

27:41.260 --> 27:43.594
- Here.
- Beautiful animal.

27:43.595 --> 27:45.263
Hi, baby.

27:45.264 --> 27:48.300
Yes. Yes, of course
you can kiss me.

27:50.002 --> 27:51.569
Aw.

27:51.570 --> 27:54.305
Hi, baby. Hi.

27:54.306 --> 27:55.742
Aw.

27:57.276 --> 27:58.609
You sure about this?

27:58.610 --> 28:01.446
We urge new owners to take
at least three months

28:01.447 --> 28:02.881
to get used to their pets.

28:02.882 --> 28:04.182
I know. He's a really great dog.

28:04.183 --> 28:05.984
It's just that, um... very sweet.

28:05.985 --> 28:08.586
It's just that he starts
barking and he doesn't stop,

28:08.587 --> 28:10.221
and... and...

28:10.222 --> 28:11.957
Yeah.

28:11.958 --> 28:14.793
You know how this is probably
going to go for Moonlight, right?

28:14.794 --> 28:16.863
No one's going to want
a two-time loser.

28:19.431 --> 28:20.967
I'm sorry.

28:22.601 --> 28:25.370
All right. Come here, baby.

28:25.371 --> 28:26.806
Come here, Moonlight.

28:30.576 --> 28:32.779
See? It wasn't so bad.

28:36.382 --> 28:38.184
All right. Go ahead.

28:56.435 --> 28:57.568
Hi.

28:57.569 --> 28:59.270
August Cacciatore.

28:59.271 --> 29:01.372
Crystal Harris.

29:01.373 --> 29:02.808
You here for the job?

29:02.809 --> 29:04.109
Hello, hello.

29:04.110 --> 29:06.044
The two of you
had a chance to meet.

29:06.045 --> 29:07.979
Want to tell us what's going on?

29:07.980 --> 29:10.648
We're about to determine
who we want to hire.

29:10.649 --> 29:12.450
See? A simple résumé
and interview

29:12.451 --> 29:13.819
just couldn't cut it?

29:13.820 --> 29:15.987
No, both résumés were stellar.

29:15.988 --> 29:18.156
This is the interview,

29:18.157 --> 29:21.592
and these... are optional.

29:21.593 --> 29:22.894
What are those for?

29:22.895 --> 29:25.030
Well, it's a game.

29:25.031 --> 29:27.065
I'm sure you've seen it before.

29:27.066 --> 29:28.733
You each pull on the rope,

29:28.734 --> 29:30.501
and whoever gets
to their champagne first...

29:30.502 --> 29:32.838
Is this for your amusement
or your pleasure?

29:32.839 --> 29:36.607
This is to decide who fits best in
the Brooks Innovations culture.

29:36.608 --> 29:37.843
Over a game of tug of war?

29:37.844 --> 29:39.644
We're not trying
to be firefighters.

29:39.645 --> 29:40.946
I'm fine with it.

29:40.947 --> 29:42.447
Well, you shouldn't be.

29:42.448 --> 29:45.016
Why should we be tied
to old-fashioned ways

29:45.017 --> 29:47.185
of determining who's
the best for a job?

29:47.186 --> 29:48.419
Crystal, we do things
differently here.

29:48.420 --> 29:49.654
If that offends you,

29:49.655 --> 29:50.935
I'm sorry we've
wasted your time.

29:57.163 --> 29:59.231
Give me the fucking gloves.

30:03.235 --> 30:04.502
Ready?

30:04.503 --> 30:05.872
Set?

30:07.173 --> 30:08.340
Pull!

30:10.542 --> 30:11.978
Aah!!

30:14.947 --> 30:16.315
Brava, Crystal.

30:18.317 --> 30:19.584
I'm... I'm good.

30:19.585 --> 30:21.386
I imagine it must have
seemed a little outlandish

30:21.387 --> 30:23.521
but we here at Brooks have
a particular aversion

30:23.522 --> 30:24.923
for tradition.

30:24.924 --> 30:27.025
This is one of the ways
we evaluate talent.

30:27.026 --> 30:28.861
Well, I get it.

30:32.731 --> 30:35.134
That's one of the ways
I celebrate.

30:39.471 --> 30:41.173
See you Monday.

30:48.915 --> 30:50.281
All right, guys.

30:50.282 --> 30:52.050
Be careful. Watch your step.

30:52.051 --> 30:53.818
Watch your step.

30:53.819 --> 30:54.920
Thanks.

30:54.921 --> 30:56.121
Thank you.

30:56.122 --> 30:58.756
God bless. Take care, okay?

30:58.757 --> 30:59.991
All right, buddy.

30:59.992 --> 31:02.828
All right, let's get going.

31:23.182 --> 31:25.952
Sir, you left your backpack.

31:26.752 --> 31:28.620
Thanks.

31:33.292 --> 31:35.493
I'd be out 50 grand
if I left it.

31:35.494 --> 31:36.561
Ooh.

31:36.562 --> 31:38.229
That's a lot of money.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.665
Yeah, I won it at the track.

31:40.666 --> 31:42.000
Lucky guy.

31:42.001 --> 31:43.969
No, not really. I got a friend

31:43.970 --> 31:46.637
who's got a gift
for picking winners.

31:46.638 --> 31:49.140
We could all use
a friend like that, right?

31:49.141 --> 31:51.977
I don't even know
what to do with it.

31:51.978 --> 31:53.744
Never had cash like that.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.381
Champagne problems, right?

31:56.882 --> 31:58.783
What would you do with 50 grand?

31:58.784 --> 32:00.986
- Me?
- Yeah.

32:00.987 --> 32:02.320
I don't know. I got two kids.

32:02.321 --> 32:04.289
Probably buy a house.

32:04.290 --> 32:06.524
Maybe put some away for college.

32:06.525 --> 32:08.359
They're both real smart.

32:08.360 --> 32:09.494
You married?

32:09.495 --> 32:11.696
16 years.

32:11.697 --> 32:13.999
But she's easy.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.333
She doesn't like fancy.

32:15.334 --> 32:18.703
I don't, either.
I don't care about money.

32:18.704 --> 32:20.038
I care about my friends.

32:20.039 --> 32:22.507
Hey, that's how it should be.

32:22.508 --> 32:24.142
Friends and family first, right?

32:24.143 --> 32:28.713
Yeah. My friend now, the one
who picks the winners,

32:28.714 --> 32:30.181
he's in big trouble now

32:30.182 --> 32:32.217
over something
that's not his fault.

32:32.218 --> 32:34.852
I'd gladly leave
this money right here,

32:34.853 --> 32:37.188
walk off this bus,
and never look back

32:37.189 --> 32:39.557
if I knew he'd be okay.

32:39.558 --> 32:41.726
We could all use
a friend like you?

32:41.727 --> 32:42.727
Ha ha ha.

32:42.728 --> 32:44.096
For you.

32:51.903 --> 32:53.204
How'd you find me?

32:53.205 --> 32:55.806
You found me.

32:55.807 --> 32:57.376
You picked me up.

32:59.111 --> 33:01.746
I'm not talking to you.
I won't lie.

33:01.747 --> 33:03.781
You don't have to lie.

33:03.782 --> 33:06.051
Just whatever you think you saw,

33:06.052 --> 33:07.685
just keep it to yourself.

33:07.686 --> 33:08.687
Think I saw?

33:10.056 --> 33:11.357
No, I know.

33:14.493 --> 33:16.594
You're never going to get
those kids through college

33:16.595 --> 33:17.729
driving a bus.

33:20.499 --> 33:21.732
There.

33:21.733 --> 33:23.435
It's all yours.

33:24.936 --> 33:26.438
Take it!

33:35.481 --> 33:36.582
Yeah.

33:40.186 --> 33:42.421
But I'll be able
to look them in the eye.

33:45.491 --> 33:46.792
Get off my bus.

33:48.460 --> 33:50.129
Take your backpack with you.

33:51.797 --> 33:53.499
This isn't my stop.

33:57.869 --> 33:59.638
Hi. Terminal 4?

34:02.108 --> 34:03.609
All terminals, ma'am.

36:28.086 --> 36:30.755
You beat on me, Berchiolli,

36:30.756 --> 36:33.492
but I'm going
to see you go down.

36:34.993 --> 36:36.261
Do you know what it's like

36:36.262 --> 36:38.897
to serve a long sentence, judge?

36:40.266 --> 36:41.499
Jesus did.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.334
He was only on that
cross for three hours,

36:43.335 --> 36:45.470
but it must have felt
like an eternity.

36:45.471 --> 36:49.173
He paid in blood for
10,000 years of sins.

36:49.174 --> 36:50.576
Your sins.

36:59.685 --> 37:01.952
You want to hurt me, judge?

37:01.953 --> 37:03.321
You wouldn't be the first.

37:03.322 --> 37:07.157
I've been bitten, kicked,

37:07.158 --> 37:08.827
stabbed, shanked.

37:10.896 --> 37:12.129
You want proof?

37:12.130 --> 37:13.899
I don't give a shit about you.

37:16.635 --> 37:18.035
Lifer.

37:18.036 --> 37:19.938
Did it with an ax blade.

37:21.807 --> 37:23.974
- Give me your hand.
- Fuck you.

37:23.975 --> 37:25.376
I said give me your hand!

37:25.377 --> 37:26.545
Fuck you!

37:30.616 --> 37:32.350
You know, I heard
the last thing PJ did

37:32.351 --> 37:34.218
before he swallowed that bullet

37:34.219 --> 37:37.323
was call your cell phone.

37:38.790 --> 37:40.325
What do you think
he wanted to tell you?

37:40.326 --> 37:41.460
Get out of here!

37:42.428 --> 37:44.463
What did your pillow say to you?

37:46.164 --> 37:47.197
What...

37:47.198 --> 37:48.366
No, no, no.

37:48.367 --> 37:50.435
It spoke to you.
What did it say?

37:50.436 --> 37:52.803
"Please help me.

37:52.804 --> 37:56.441
Somebody please help me."

37:56.442 --> 37:58.776
That's what you heard,
didn't you?

37:58.777 --> 38:00.745
Was it PJ?

38:00.746 --> 38:04.616
Was it PJ after you
didn't answer his call?

38:06.652 --> 38:08.720
Or was it you talking to God?

38:10.956 --> 38:13.658
You enjoy hearing people
beg for their own lives,

38:13.659 --> 38:16.161
but you refuse to hear
the voice of your only son.

38:17.429 --> 38:19.229
The voice of the Almighty.

38:19.230 --> 38:23.100
Please leave me alone.
Leave me alone.

38:23.101 --> 38:25.035
Please, please spare me.

38:25.036 --> 38:28.373
Only God can save you
from scratching and clawing

38:28.374 --> 38:31.909
on the hem of existence
cold and alone,

38:31.910 --> 38:33.044
locked in this...

38:34.245 --> 38:35.546
cage,

38:35.547 --> 38:36.814
while other men are free

38:36.815 --> 38:39.918
to hold and fondle
your beautiful wife.

38:41.787 --> 38:44.455
You're alone for
the rest of your life.

38:44.456 --> 38:46.392
Face the truth.

38:47.826 --> 38:50.295
And what's the truth, judge?

38:51.397 --> 38:53.532
What is the truth?

38:54.966 --> 38:57.001
You could have
prevented PJ's death.

38:57.002 --> 38:58.470
You son of a bitch.

39:05.611 --> 39:07.712
Circumcise, therefore,
the foreskin of your heart

39:07.713 --> 39:09.915
and be no longer stubborn!

39:14.886 --> 39:18.424
Tell me you believe
in the power of the Almighty.

39:20.759 --> 39:22.527
There's one bullet
in the cylinder.

39:22.528 --> 39:25.897
Do you believe in
the power of the Almighty!

39:26.898 --> 39:30.334
Aah! Aah! I believe!
I believe in God!

39:30.335 --> 39:31.569
- Do you believe?
- I believe.

39:31.570 --> 39:32.670
Do you love Him?

39:32.671 --> 39:34.440
I love Him! I love God!

39:43.348 --> 39:45.551
May the Lord be with you,
Pernell.

40:17.215 --> 40:18.549
Mike, we warned you,

40:18.550 --> 40:20.217
but you wanted to keep working.

40:20.218 --> 40:21.652
How'd the psycho find me?

40:21.653 --> 40:25.289
I think he may have
tracked you from here.

40:25.290 --> 40:27.492
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Easy, easy.

40:27.493 --> 40:29.860
We're making
arrangements to move you.

40:29.861 --> 40:32.196
You're taking a state-paid
vacation from work,

40:32.197 --> 40:35.766
and you'll be in a new
place within 48 hours.

40:35.767 --> 40:38.937
In the meantime,
you'll be protected 24/7.

40:42.073 --> 40:43.073
Mike.

40:44.242 --> 40:45.911
Can you tough this out?

40:47.078 --> 40:48.146
Yeah.

40:50.982 --> 40:52.183
Okay.

40:54.352 --> 40:56.186
Good.

40:56.187 --> 40:57.455
Good.

41:06.798 --> 41:08.365
Shh. Alicia.

41:08.366 --> 41:10.400
It's me. It's me. It's me.

41:10.401 --> 41:12.637
Shh. Shh.

41:12.638 --> 41:14.640
What are you doing here?

41:16.908 --> 41:18.375
I love you.

41:18.376 --> 41:19.610
Okay.

41:19.611 --> 41:20.978
Are you high?

41:20.979 --> 41:21.947
No. No, no, no.

41:21.948 --> 41:23.648
You have to get out of here now.

41:23.649 --> 41:25.415
I was high,

41:25.416 --> 41:27.553
but I'm not high now, I promise.

41:28.887 --> 41:31.188
I want us to be a family.

41:31.189 --> 41:32.557
You are high.

41:32.558 --> 41:34.725
Alicia.

41:34.726 --> 41:37.563
I've never been more clear
in my entire crazy life.

41:39.264 --> 41:40.665
I want you.

41:40.666 --> 41:42.801
I want our baby.

41:43.735 --> 41:45.770
And I want us to be together.

41:45.771 --> 41:47.773
With the people at the church?

41:49.908 --> 41:53.111
Forget about the church.
We are the church.

41:55.280 --> 41:57.148
I sure love you.

41:59.317 --> 42:00.986
And I love our baby.

42:13.398 --> 42:15.100
I love you so much.

42:20.405 --> 42:21.907
Alicia?

42:22.874 --> 42:24.208
W-What are you doing?

42:24.209 --> 42:26.243
Hey! Get off her!

42:26.244 --> 42:27.645
Get away from her!

42:27.646 --> 42:29.947
- I said get...
- No! No! He's my pastor!

42:29.948 --> 42:30.948
Aah!

42:33.251 --> 42:35.385
Aah!

42:35.386 --> 42:36.487
No!

42:41.126 --> 42:44.630
My God, what the fuck
have you done!

42:52.704 --> 42:54.305
Is this seat taken?

42:58.276 --> 42:59.844
You here to gloat?

42:59.845 --> 43:03.047
No. I'm here to defend you.

43:03.048 --> 43:06.483
Why in the fuck would I
ever agree to that?

43:06.484 --> 43:07.985
The first time
you open your mouth,

43:07.986 --> 43:11.656
Stanton is gonna ram her dick
into your Adam's apple.

43:11.657 --> 43:14.558
Now why wouldn't you say yes?

43:14.559 --> 43:16.661
Well, you did fuck my wife.

43:16.662 --> 43:19.664
No. You fucked your wife

43:19.665 --> 43:23.367
the minute you married that
5K-a-night piece of chocolate cake.

43:23.368 --> 43:25.569
I slept with your wife.

43:25.570 --> 43:27.805
But you're the one
who fucked her.

43:27.806 --> 43:29.840
And now you're going
to do the same to yourself.

43:29.841 --> 43:31.508
So you feel that way,

43:31.509 --> 43:33.143
but I'm supposed to believe
you're going to help me.

43:33.144 --> 43:34.578
I already did. How do you think

43:34.579 --> 43:36.681
your case got called first?

43:36.682 --> 43:38.348
And I can get
your bail reinstated.

43:38.349 --> 43:40.185
You want out of here or not?

43:43.388 --> 43:45.691
Who called you? Randy?

43:54.599 --> 43:56.768
Good morning, Mr. Harris.

43:58.704 --> 44:01.205
Mr. Tremble. You are...

44:01.206 --> 44:03.207
Representing the defendant,
Your Honor.

44:03.208 --> 44:04.474
Good.

44:04.475 --> 44:05.943
Now what's your client's excuse

44:05.944 --> 44:07.745
for breaking the law, counselor?

44:07.746 --> 44:09.279
No excuses.
Judge Harris' actions

44:09.280 --> 44:11.281
are well within the stipulations
of his bail, Your Honor.

44:11.282 --> 44:13.718
Therefore, we motion
to have my client's

44:13.719 --> 44:15.385
previous terms
of house arrest reinstated.

44:15.386 --> 44:17.722
For God's sake, dream on, Nick.

44:17.723 --> 44:19.256
You're saying he didn't run?

44:19.257 --> 44:21.325
Judge Harris was arrested at
a restaurant in San Vicente,

44:21.326 --> 44:22.492
which is where he lives.

44:22.493 --> 44:23.794
Does that sound
like he's running?

44:23.795 --> 44:25.429
We're not here because
he went to dinner.

44:25.430 --> 44:28.598
We're here because of his
little jaunt to San Francisco.

44:28.599 --> 44:30.768
Your Honor, we have photos

44:30.769 --> 44:32.602
of the defendant
on the Bay Bridge.

44:32.603 --> 44:34.171
- Are those photos time-stamped?
- Absolutely.

44:34.172 --> 44:35.906
The evidence is indisputable.

44:35.907 --> 44:37.775
I think I can save us
a ton of time.

44:37.776 --> 44:39.110
Your Honor, may I approach?

44:41.412 --> 44:45.950
This is a copy of
Mr. Harris' bail agreement.

44:45.951 --> 44:47.953
I flagged the part that matters.

44:49.354 --> 44:51.355
According to the terms
of his house arrest,

44:51.356 --> 44:54.224
Judge Harris is entitled
to go anywhere in the county

44:54.225 --> 44:57.494
during work hours. I'm glad
those photos are time-stamped.

44:57.495 --> 44:59.363
2:17 p.m.

44:59.364 --> 45:01.131
That is well within
the parameters

45:01.132 --> 45:03.300
of my client's duly
reported hours of work.

45:03.301 --> 45:05.535
Hold on. It has
to be work related.

45:05.536 --> 45:09.506
The defendant is not currently
adjudicating any cases,

45:09.507 --> 45:10.775
and if he were,

45:10.776 --> 45:12.676
they'd be right here
in this building,

45:12.677 --> 45:14.144
- not San Francisco.
- Your Honor,

45:14.145 --> 45:16.947
I have a signed affidavit
from Judge Harris' clerk,

45:16.948 --> 45:18.949
Miss Randy Wilkins, who is here

45:18.950 --> 45:20.417
and ready to testify

45:20.418 --> 45:22.486
that Judge Harris
went to San Francisco

45:22.487 --> 45:24.188
to do research.

45:24.189 --> 45:25.990
Research. That's part
of the job description.

45:25.991 --> 45:27.491
Am I right, Judge Stanton?

45:27.492 --> 45:29.059
Your Honor, I don't care

45:29.060 --> 45:33.663
if Mr. Harris went to Mexico
to talk law with El Chapo.

45:33.664 --> 45:36.700
The fact of the matter is
he removed his ankle device.

45:36.701 --> 45:38.836
It was a clear act of deception

45:38.837 --> 45:42.439
and contrary to the terms
of his electronic supervision.

45:42.440 --> 45:45.042
The DA makes a point, counselor.

45:45.043 --> 45:47.444
That device
isn't a swatch watch.

45:47.445 --> 45:48.946
It's supposed to stay on.

45:48.947 --> 45:50.314
Without question, Your Honor.

45:50.315 --> 45:54.852
And here is a list
of 673 documented cases

45:54.853 --> 45:57.822
of electronic monitors
malfunctioning

45:57.823 --> 45:59.389
during the course
of the past three years.

45:59.390 --> 46:01.291
Now we're just talking
about the cases in California.

46:01.292 --> 46:03.227
Your Honor, nobody said anything

46:03.228 --> 46:04.995
about the device malfunctioning.

46:04.996 --> 46:06.396
You never asked.

46:06.397 --> 46:08.332
All right, I'm accepting
counsel's motion

46:08.333 --> 46:09.934
to reinstate conditions of bail

46:09.935 --> 46:12.069
with one adjustment.

46:12.070 --> 46:15.907
No more leaving the city
limits for any reason.

46:17.442 --> 46:20.177
Looks like you dodged
a bullet, Mr. Harris.

46:20.178 --> 46:21.711
Judge.

46:21.712 --> 46:23.548
Judge Harris.

46:25.917 --> 46:27.617
Every time I mention
Anne Wu's name,

46:27.618 --> 46:30.054
Crystal looked like she
wanted to shit a starfish.

46:30.055 --> 46:34.691
Then she pretended Anne just
disappeared from the party

46:34.692 --> 46:36.626
after the concrete pour.

46:36.627 --> 46:40.998
But I have video of them
leaving the ceremony together

46:40.999 --> 46:43.869
in Crystal's car.

46:45.036 --> 46:46.871
You're saying she lied to you.

46:46.872 --> 46:49.406
She lies about seeing Anne.

46:49.407 --> 46:50.707
Then Anne vanishes,

46:50.708 --> 46:52.776
and who ends up with Anne's job?

46:52.777 --> 46:54.544
And there's more, okay?

46:54.545 --> 46:55.880
There's a lot more.

46:55.881 --> 46:57.882
All right, all right.

46:57.883 --> 46:59.516
Take a breath.

46:59.517 --> 47:00.750
What else?

47:00.751 --> 47:02.386
Anne Wu ran point

47:02.387 --> 47:05.522
on acquiring a piece
of software from PJ Harris.

47:05.523 --> 47:06.924
Bathwater.

47:06.925 --> 47:08.893
I think Crystal Harris
refused to sell,

47:08.894 --> 47:12.262
and I think Anne
couldn't accept that.

47:12.263 --> 47:16.033
I think Anne hired some people
to steal the software.

47:16.034 --> 47:19.269
I found suspicious
payments from Anne

47:19.270 --> 47:21.205
to vendors I've never heard of.

47:21.206 --> 47:23.373
Turns out they don't exist.

47:23.374 --> 47:27.311
Anne knew what that
software was worth.

47:27.312 --> 47:29.413
Maybe she even had
a buyer lined up.

47:29.414 --> 47:30.814
But here's
the connective tissue.

47:30.815 --> 47:32.917
You know who
Jocelyn Harris is, right?

47:32.918 --> 47:35.785
I'm presuming
she's a Harris relative.

47:35.786 --> 47:39.356
PJ's wife,
Crystal's daughter-in-law.

47:39.357 --> 47:41.258
She was raped.

47:41.259 --> 47:44.361
She was raped during the time

47:44.362 --> 47:47.497
Anne Wu was making
those mysterious payments.

47:47.498 --> 47:51.768
Maybe it was some kind
of extortion or, cover.

47:51.769 --> 47:53.203
I don't know.

47:53.204 --> 47:55.639
But there's got to be
something there.

47:55.640 --> 47:59.443
Look, I am sure that
these things are related.

47:59.444 --> 48:03.213
And Anne Wu
covered her tracks so well,

48:03.214 --> 48:04.949
she must have had a partner

48:04.950 --> 48:07.117
working with her
inside the company.

48:07.118 --> 48:10.320
Nathan needs to be informed.

48:10.321 --> 48:12.590
There was someone in the
company working with her.

48:13.724 --> 48:15.259
Fuck.

48:15.260 --> 48:16.760
Something's still in there.

48:16.761 --> 48:18.095
It's driving me fucking insane.

48:18.096 --> 48:20.031
Can you see if
something's in my eye?

48:23.701 --> 48:25.170
Move back.

48:26.437 --> 48:28.639
Do you see anything?

48:31.409 --> 48:33.611
I know. I know.

48:35.113 --> 48:36.982
It's the air.

48:41.019 --> 48:42.786
Drugs would have been
less painful,

48:42.787 --> 48:44.055
but they can be discovered.

48:46.824 --> 48:48.359
I'm sorry about that, Guy.

49:24.162 --> 49:25.363
Thank you.

49:34.239 --> 49:36.440
I did not like
seeing you in there.

49:36.441 --> 49:39.510
You should have tasted
the bologna.

49:54.525 --> 49:55.559
You hungry?

49:55.560 --> 49:57.327
I already called the Court Club.

49:57.328 --> 49:58.762
Our table's waiting.

49:58.763 --> 49:59.963
Pernell...

49:59.964 --> 50:01.165
It's going to be better now.

50:01.166 --> 50:03.067
I'm not having any visions.

50:03.068 --> 50:04.301
You're here.

50:04.302 --> 50:05.702
It's going to be better.

50:05.703 --> 50:08.673
I'm here,
but I'm not here for you.

50:11.742 --> 50:13.344
Then for what?

50:15.213 --> 50:18.915
That Bathwater software
was his life's work,

50:18.916 --> 50:21.985
and I need to know
what happened to it

50:21.986 --> 50:23.853
for his sake.

50:23.854 --> 50:25.789
PJ's gone, Crys.

50:25.790 --> 50:27.358
We're here, you and me.

50:28.959 --> 50:30.728
Let's find out
what happened to that.

50:32.663 --> 50:35.233
I'll be checking into
a hotel in the morning.

50:39.870 --> 50:41.239
Crys.

50:49.714 --> 50:52.349
You stay. I'll...

50:52.350 --> 50:54.552
I'll find someplace else.

50:56.621 --> 50:57.822
Thank you.

51:03.661 --> 51:06.331
This is what happens to sinners.

51:07.198 --> 51:09.500
You lied, Pernell.
