01:46.815 --> 01:49.401
<i>President and Mrs. Underwood
are back in Louisiana today,</i>

01:49.484 --> 01:50.861
<i>in an effort to pick up...</i>

01:50.944 --> 01:52.821
<i>Underwood
is in Las Vegas today,</i>

01:52.905 --> 01:54.907
<i>meeting with leadership
from the Culinary Union...</i>

01:54.990 --> 01:56.408
<i>...questions
from undecided voters</i>

01:56.491 --> 01:57.868
<i>in Charleston this afternoon,</i>

01:57.951 --> 01:59.995
<i>the first of three events
the Underwood campaign...</i>

02:00.078 --> 02:03.081
<i>The First Lady took questions
at a town hall meeting in Casper today.</i>

02:03.165 --> 02:05.626
<i>That's 12 cities
in half as many days for the Underwoods.</i>

02:05.709 --> 02:07.210
<i>Meanwhile,
they still trail Conway</i>

02:07.294 --> 02:09.922
<i>by 12 to 14 points in every national poll.</i>

02:10.005 --> 02:11.256
<i>That's a big gap to close...</i>

02:11.339 --> 02:13.591
<i>...supporters in Boise
waited an extra two hours</i>

02:13.676 --> 02:14.760
<i>for the president...</i>

02:14.843 --> 02:17.095
<i>The president's
whistle-stop tour of Ohio will...</i>

02:17.179 --> 02:19.181
<i>You're one of the states
that will decide this!</i>

02:19.264 --> 02:21.183
<i>...took questions from
undecided voters</i>

02:21.266 --> 02:23.977
<i>in Charleston this afternoon,
the first of three events...</i>

02:24.061 --> 02:27.564
<i>Please give a big Boston welcome
to the next president...</i>

02:27.648 --> 02:29.441
<i>For many Americans,
the question remains,</i>

02:29.524 --> 02:33.028
<i>what would an Underwood-Underwood
White House look like?</i>

02:33.111 --> 02:34.529
<i>Both Underwoods have courted...</i>

02:35.613 --> 02:38.116
So, Arizona, Nevada,
and California on Monday,

02:38.200 --> 02:39.993
then the upper Midwest on Tuesday.

02:40.077 --> 02:42.913
It's not enough. Conway's hitting
way more states than we are.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.666
Well, he's not a sitting president.
He has more time than you do.

02:45.749 --> 02:47.292
Well, then we have to make more time.

02:47.375 --> 02:50.503
We have to get out there.
We've got to shake...

02:52.547 --> 02:53.787
Francis, are you okay?

02:54.967 --> 02:56.593
- I'm fine.
- Sit down for a moment.

02:56.676 --> 02:59.346
No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Let's continue.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.728
If you wanna add
a fundraiser in California,

03:05.811 --> 03:07.520
we can make that happen.

03:07.604 --> 03:10.023
Uh-huh. Okay.

03:11.233 --> 03:12.525
So?

03:12.609 --> 03:15.028
I agree with Dr. Saxon
and the medical team.

03:15.112 --> 03:17.072
We should reduce air travel
to once a week.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.741
I'm afraid that's not possible.

03:18.824 --> 03:21.243
You wanted a second opinion, sir.
You have it.

03:21.326 --> 03:23.726
I didn't want a second opinion.
I wanted a different opinion.

03:23.787 --> 03:25.247
Planes take a toll.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.499
We're concerned
about a sudden organ rejection.

03:27.582 --> 03:30.335
I can't win an election
if I can't travel.

03:30.418 --> 03:32.337
You can't win if you're hospitalized.

03:33.005 --> 03:34.464
Thank you, Doctor.

03:41.596 --> 03:44.808
You stay here.
I'll go wherever Conway goes, I'll just...

03:44.892 --> 03:47.060
I'm on the top of the ticket.
It has to be me.

03:47.144 --> 03:49.479
We can't ignore
the doctors, Francis.

03:49.562 --> 03:50.981
It's the story we tell.

03:51.064 --> 03:54.234
If I stay here,
Conway prances around the country,

03:54.317 --> 03:56.862
playing up his fighter-pilot image,
and meanwhile,

03:56.945 --> 03:59.782
- I'm stuck here in the Rose Garden...
- I won't risk losing you.

04:07.205 --> 04:08.665
Let's be smart about this.

04:10.876 --> 04:15.380
- I need to project strength.
- So project it.

04:15.463 --> 04:17.507
The air strikes are working, sir.

04:17.589 --> 04:19.802
We've stopped ICO's advance
to the Euphrates.

04:19.885 --> 04:22.679
We've delayed the advance.
We haven't stopped it.

04:22.763 --> 04:26.809
Your own reports say they're regrouping.
I want a decisive blow,

04:26.892 --> 04:29.602
a face, the leadership,
to send a message.

04:29.686 --> 04:32.730
Uh, the Ahmadi brothers are in hiding.
We don't know their location.

04:32.815 --> 04:34.900
Well, your task is to find them.

04:34.983 --> 04:37.485
We've tried, sir.
Our assets hit a wall.

04:37.569 --> 04:40.989
To root them out would require
special forces on the ground.

04:41.073 --> 04:43.116
That is a step I am willing to take.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.285
We don't have authorization
from the Syrians.

04:45.368 --> 04:47.704
Secretary Durant will smooth that out.

04:47.788 --> 04:52.042
I will not be satisfied by blocking
the serpent's path, gentlemen.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.377
I wanna cut off its goddamn head.

04:57.589 --> 04:59.967
The Syrians will say no,
and when they do,

05:00.050 --> 05:02.385
see if they'll work
with the Russian special forces.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.721
The Russians do the dirty work,
we take all the credit.

05:04.805 --> 05:05.889
Petrov won't go for that.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.183
Well, he will if we give him back
some of our drilling zones.

05:08.266 --> 05:10.310
Well, that'll take congressional approval.

05:10.393 --> 05:12.687
Doug's laying the groundwork now.

05:12.770 --> 05:16.358
Are you interested in my opinion on this,
or has it already been decided?

05:16.441 --> 05:18.861
I want to move fast,
so unless you have a quicker option,

05:18.944 --> 05:21.738
it's probably best
you keep it to yourself.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.698
- Yes, sir.
- Cathy.

05:25.367 --> 05:27.702
Do we have a problem?

05:27.785 --> 05:30.455
No, sir.
I'll coordinate with Doug.

05:32.916 --> 05:35.460
After a dog's bitten you,
you either put it to sleep,

05:35.543 --> 05:37.129
or you put a muzzle on it.

05:38.338 --> 05:41.091
I've chosen a muzzle... for now.

05:43.218 --> 05:46.138
Hi. I was, uh,
thinking on the way over here

05:46.221 --> 05:49.349
that I don't wanna do
the same speech at every event.

05:49.432 --> 05:50.976
I really think we'll get
more news coverage

05:51.059 --> 05:52.810
if I have a different speech every time.

05:52.895 --> 05:54.646
LeAnn already told me.

05:56.231 --> 05:58.525
I've been working on some variations.

05:59.692 --> 06:03.571
I think, uh, we also need to respond
to what Conway is saying...

06:03.655 --> 06:06.199
at all times.
Start putting pressure on him.

06:06.283 --> 06:08.576
Seth's office is sending me transcripts.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.297
There was
an interview query from <i>Time,</i>

06:20.380 --> 06:22.507
a voicemail about some memorial fund.

06:22.590 --> 06:24.842
Senator Halston called
about the meeting on Tuesday.

06:24.927 --> 06:27.387
Wait. The voicemail.

06:27.470 --> 06:31.058
Uh, Laura Moretti,
from the Anthony Moretti Memorial Fund.

06:31.141 --> 06:35.145
- I guess you... donated?
- Cue that up for me.

06:37.897 --> 06:39.857
Just press one when you're ready.

06:39.942 --> 06:42.610
- I'll catch up with you in a little bit.
- Okay.

06:55.498 --> 06:57.375
<i>Hi, this is Laura Moretti</i>

06:57.459 --> 06:59.461
<i>leaving a message for Douglas Stamper.</i>

06:59.544 --> 07:03.090
<i>I just, uh...
I wanted to reach out to you personally,</i>

07:03.173 --> 07:06.051
<i>to say thank you
for the incredibly generous donation.</i>

07:06.134 --> 07:10.472
<i>It's the biggest donation we've received.
By a lot.</i>

07:10.555 --> 07:13.475
<i>Uh, I don't know
how you found out about us.</i>

07:13.558 --> 07:15.560
<i>Maybe because of
the president's transplant.</i>

07:15.643 --> 07:17.437
<i>But whatever the reason,</i>

07:17.520 --> 07:20.983
<i>it means so much to us,
to me and my children.</i>

07:22.150 --> 07:24.694
<i>Anyway, I...
and I know this is a long shot,</i>

07:24.777 --> 07:29.616
<i>but if you're ever free for coffee,
I'd love to thank you in person.</i>

07:29.699 --> 07:34.662
<i>No worries if... if you can't.
Um, thanks again, Mr. Stamper.</i>

07:49.386 --> 07:53.223
<i>Hi, uh, this is Laura Moretti
leaving a message for Douglas Stamper.</i>

07:53.306 --> 07:56.809
<i>I just, uh...
I wanted to reach out to you personally,</i>

07:56.893 --> 07:59.812
<i>to say thank you
for the incredibly generous donation.</i>

07:59.896 --> 08:01.898
<i>It's the biggest donation we've received.</i>

08:01.982 --> 08:05.152
Will there be enough time
to get this up on the teleprompter?

08:05.235 --> 08:07.570
They're mostly cuts.

08:07.654 --> 08:09.990
Should be quick.
I'll get it there now.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.703
What did you change?

08:17.289 --> 08:19.791
I took out the paragraph about love.

08:19.874 --> 08:22.169
- That's the best part.
- It was too soft.

08:57.704 --> 09:00.290
This used to be
a barbecue joint, here.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.753
Frank came a lot before he was president.

09:08.673 --> 09:10.800
What happened to it?

09:10.883 --> 09:14.096
Same thing that happens
to everything Frank touches.

09:27.275 --> 09:30.153
- You mind?
- I do mind.

09:31.488 --> 09:33.615
I haven't agreed to anything yet.

09:36.784 --> 09:38.661
Tell me what you know.

09:38.745 --> 09:41.623
I know Underwood lied
about the money laundering.

09:43.458 --> 09:46.336
I know he met with Lanagin
when he said he didn't.

09:48.838 --> 09:51.048
I know Edward Meechum
doctored travel records,

09:51.133 --> 09:52.759
and I know you were there for all of it.

09:52.842 --> 09:56.304
Then Tusk gets a pardon.
You get Chief of Staff.

09:57.054 --> 09:59.599
- Old news.
- Why'd you quit the job?

09:59.682 --> 10:01.851
I wanted to go back in the private sector.

10:01.934 --> 10:05.105
You just said everything
Underwood touches gets demolished.

10:06.231 --> 10:08.191
I don't like the man.
So what?

10:08.275 --> 10:10.943
Why'd you team up with him again
for the Russia deal?

10:11.027 --> 10:13.571
I don't have to like the people
I work with.

10:14.156 --> 10:16.241
Plus, there was a fortune to be made.

10:17.159 --> 10:18.910
See...

10:18.993 --> 10:21.996
I don't think you give a damn
about the money.

10:23.956 --> 10:28.670
There's a lot more to this
you're not admitting.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.755
But I think you want to.

10:32.424 --> 10:34.759
So, truth is,
you don't have anything solid.

10:35.302 --> 10:38.388
I will get to the bottom of this story.

10:38.471 --> 10:41.474
We can talk now, or you can wait
till you have a team of lawyers

10:41.558 --> 10:43.685
talking to my fact checkers.

10:47.689 --> 10:50.233
I've been threatened by billionaires
and by presidents.

10:51.151 --> 10:55.863
You think an out-of-work reporter
makes me nervous?

10:57.615 --> 11:00.910
I can call the White House right now,
let 'em know you're working on this story.

11:00.993 --> 11:03.120
That's a gamble I took asking to meet.

11:04.456 --> 11:06.123
But my chips...

11:07.584 --> 11:10.378
are on the better part of you prevailing.

11:13.381 --> 11:18.135
The who... the what...
the why, how...

11:19.929 --> 11:21.764
Don't ignore where.

11:32.359 --> 11:35.820
I think it'd be better
if I turn it.

11:38.573 --> 11:40.825
I think...
I think this side is a little better.

11:40.908 --> 11:44.412
- Yes, that's very nice.
- Freddy.

11:44.496 --> 11:46.873
- Good afternoon, Mr. President.
- Good afternoon.

11:46.956 --> 11:50.585
- Helen is teaching me the ropes.
- We'll leave you be, sir.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.421
Oh, Freddy?

11:53.505 --> 11:56.924
Why don't you stay back for a little bit?
Thank you very much.

11:57.008 --> 11:58.760
I'll be right there.

12:00.928 --> 12:02.639
It's been a while.

12:02.722 --> 12:06.309
Well, they, uh... moved me
to the flower shop a few months ago.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.435
The basement.

12:07.519 --> 12:09.521
That's probably why
you haven't seen me around.

12:09.604 --> 12:12.565
Never would've guessed that,
well, that this would be my thing.

12:13.816 --> 12:16.319
I guess you can teach
an old dog new tricks.

12:18.154 --> 12:20.865
- How's your grandson?
- He's good, good.

12:20.948 --> 12:23.326
- Just started school again.
- Mmm.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.662
- What grade is he in now?
- Sixth grade.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.789
- Getting up there.
- Mmm-hmm.

12:28.998 --> 12:30.875
I... I really should go.

12:30.958 --> 12:33.670
We got a big, uh,
shipment of autumn blooms in.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.923
Well, then another time, I guess, maybe.

12:37.006 --> 12:38.716
You know, Frank...

12:41.803 --> 12:43.262
I'm gonna be leaving soon.

12:44.472 --> 12:47.350
Helen's husband opened up
a flower shop in Georgetown.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.268
They want me to work there.

12:50.728 --> 12:53.230
Well, are you not happy here, Freddy?

12:54.524 --> 12:57.109
Time to try something new.

12:57.819 --> 13:01.323
Well, is there anything I can do
to convince you to stay?

13:01.406 --> 13:02.990
A raise? Better hours?

13:03.074 --> 13:06.828
I appreciate it,
but I've already told Helen yes,

13:06.911 --> 13:12.166
and... I plan on keeping my word on that.
It's what I want.

13:13.960 --> 13:18.172
Well, I'm gonna miss you around, Freddy.
There's not many people here...

13:19.757 --> 13:21.343
Well, I guess there aren't
that many people here

13:21.426 --> 13:23.428
I'm all that comfortable with.

13:23.511 --> 13:26.514
You know what you should do
before you go?

13:26.598 --> 13:29.351
You should come up here one night
and cook us a rack of ribs.

13:29.434 --> 13:32.895
Now, I realize oven-baked
isn't nearly as good as the smoker,

13:32.979 --> 13:35.857
but you'd make 'em delicious, anyhow.

13:35.940 --> 13:38.234
Ribs? Really?

13:38.317 --> 13:41.028
You want me to cook ribs for you.

13:41.112 --> 13:43.948
Well, sure, just like old times.
What's wrong with that?

13:44.031 --> 13:45.825
I'm just the help, ain't I?

13:46.951 --> 13:50.497
- No, that's not true.
- I tell you I got something good going,

13:50.580 --> 13:52.540
and your first thought ain't,

13:52.624 --> 13:54.333
- "Freddy, congratulations."
- Oh...

13:54.417 --> 13:56.503
It's "make me ribs."
And what's my big send-off?

13:56.586 --> 13:58.212
- I get to cook you ribs.
- No.

13:58.295 --> 14:00.632
Look, you are being
way oversensitive about this.

14:00.715 --> 14:02.509
You're misinterpreting what I meant.

14:02.592 --> 14:03.885
You're right.

14:04.719 --> 14:06.388
It's all my fault.

14:08.264 --> 14:12.894
- I don't know how Claire does it.
- What did you just say?

14:12.977 --> 14:15.730
Is this how you treat her?
She part of the collection, too?

14:15.813 --> 14:17.690
I don't know where
all this is coming from,

14:17.774 --> 14:21.861
but it's extremely ungrateful,
given all that I have done for you.

14:21.944 --> 14:24.656
What did you do for me, Frank?

14:26.240 --> 14:28.535
This is the White House.

14:28.618 --> 14:31.913
You will call me "Mr. President"!

14:31.996 --> 14:33.998
You're a motherfucker!

14:34.916 --> 14:36.333
Get out!

14:39.962 --> 14:43.425
My bad, my bad.

14:43.508 --> 14:47.554
You're a motherfucker, Mr. President!

14:52.975 --> 14:57.063
Governor Conway continues to say
we're not doing enough about terrorism,

14:57.146 --> 15:01.943
but he ignores the fact that
ICO has been stopped in its tracks.

15:02.026 --> 15:05.780
The president is working tirelessly
to combat our enemies abroad,

15:05.863 --> 15:09.033
<i>and what Governor Conway lacks
in his assessment...</i>

15:09.116 --> 15:12.412
<i>is the decades of experience
the president brings...</i>

15:12.495 --> 15:16.040
Do you think you should keep
calling him "the president"?

15:16.123 --> 15:18.043
Well, I wanna emphasize
that we're running mates,

15:18.125 --> 15:21.546
and LeAnn is telling me that
the marriage angle isn't working.

15:21.629 --> 15:22.922
Screw the research.

15:23.005 --> 15:27.677
People want to hear
the real you, a real person.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.679
That's what you gave them
at the convention.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.263
- Ow.
- Sorry.

15:31.347 --> 15:33.015
That was very different.

15:33.099 --> 15:36.268
Exactly. It was very different.
It was honest.

15:36.352 --> 15:40.690
And you don't want
to just react to what he's saying.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.067
You wanna offer something.

15:43.150 --> 15:45.570
I have been campaigning
with Francis for 30 years.

15:45.653 --> 15:48.322
You don't ever let the opponent
walk all over you.

15:48.405 --> 15:50.199
If you're getting attacked,
you fight back.

15:50.282 --> 15:52.577
Fine, but fight back in a different way.

15:52.660 --> 15:57.123
This guy is...
He's all spotlight and surface,

15:57.206 --> 16:00.710
and magazine covers and Twitter.
Don't play his game.

16:00.793 --> 16:04.797
Don't play the game at all, please.
Get beyond the game.

16:04.881 --> 16:08.593
Ow. You know what?
Let's finish this in the morning, please.

16:18.728 --> 16:20.938
I'm sorry.
You're right.

16:21.022 --> 16:23.816
You have a lot more experience
in this kind of thing than I do.

16:23.900 --> 16:27.904
- I should follow your lead.
- No, I... I respect your feedback.

16:34.661 --> 16:37.914
Thank you for being so professional
about everything.

16:37.997 --> 16:41.417
- You've been very kind.
- I'm not kind.

16:42.877 --> 16:44.420
Just realistic.

16:50.467 --> 16:53.596
That paragraph you wrote about love,
it made me uncomfortable.

16:59.476 --> 17:03.189
- Saying you love Francis?
- I do love him.

17:07.569 --> 17:09.904
Then what made you uncomfortable?

17:14.157 --> 17:16.367
Saying it in front of you.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.851
- Yes?
- Yeah.

18:26.147 --> 18:30.234
- How'd she do?
- Very little effect.

18:30.317 --> 18:32.528
- She was all over the news.
- White noise.

18:33.613 --> 18:36.282
So how do we make it stick?

18:36.365 --> 18:38.910
Well, there's not much I can do.

18:38.993 --> 18:41.453
We gave you access.
I need more than I'm getting.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.127
You're supposed to tell me
what people want.

18:49.086 --> 18:53.590
People didn't know they wanted jazz
until they heard it for the first time.

18:53.675 --> 18:58.012
I can get them to like the music.
I can't compose it.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.640
Give me something I can work with.

19:12.944 --> 19:15.112
Is this something
we could take public?

19:15.196 --> 19:17.073
No, it's classified.

19:17.156 --> 19:20.034
But it's perfect,
the president colluding with the Russians.

19:20.117 --> 19:22.244
The idea has merit.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.038
The Russians will have far more access,

19:24.121 --> 19:25.873
and it doesn't put American troops
in harm's way.

19:25.957 --> 19:28.517
We don't get votes by praising
the president's policy.

19:28.584 --> 19:30.837
Let's have Dreyer block it in committee.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.923
I don't like the way the president's
handled ICO from the get-go,

19:34.006 --> 19:37.301
- but his approach might work here.
- That's what I'm trying to prevent.

19:38.427 --> 19:40.429
So, you wanna keep
the ICO leadership alive,

19:40.512 --> 19:42.514
so we can stay on message?

19:42.598 --> 19:46.352
Just until November, and then
we'll hit 'em hard after inauguration.

19:46.435 --> 19:49.897
This is the exact sort of BS
I resigned over in the first place.

19:50.940 --> 19:52.649
I'll see you over there.

19:53.567 --> 19:55.444
Two months away from winning this thing.

19:55.527 --> 19:58.405
But if he gains the initiative,
if he picks up any momentum,

19:58.489 --> 20:00.199
that could put us in the margin of error.

20:00.282 --> 20:01.784
I thought you were different.

20:01.868 --> 20:05.412
Don't get any ideas, General.

20:05.496 --> 20:09.125
You threw caution into the wind
when you got yourself on my ticket.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.335
You do it again,
you start to look foolish.

20:11.418 --> 20:13.880
You talk to Dreyer and 86 this bill.

20:16.048 --> 20:19.426
I couldn't come to Wisconsin
without having a taste test.

20:24.140 --> 20:27.476
Mr. Hayes.
My name's Tom Hammerschmidt.

20:28.477 --> 20:31.317
I'm a freelance reporter. I was hoping
I could talk to you for a moment.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.357
I don't talk to reporters.

20:34.275 --> 20:38.905
- It's a story about the president.
- Did you not hear me the first time?

20:40.364 --> 20:45.077
I think things happened...
in your barbecue place.

20:45.161 --> 20:46.913
Meetings.

20:46.996 --> 20:48.790
Things you might have overheard.

20:50.124 --> 20:54.711
I think the president broke the law,
and I think you know about it.

20:55.922 --> 20:58.674
Come with me.
Let's talk where no one can hear us.

21:13.689 --> 21:16.943
- So, uh, you bring a recorder?
- Yeah.

21:37.379 --> 21:40.216
All right.
Here's the truth.

21:40.299 --> 21:45.554
I don't work for him no more.
I don't serve him ribs no more.

21:45.637 --> 21:48.265
I don't want nothing
to do with him no more.

21:48.349 --> 21:52.186
Even if I hated him, and I do hate him...

21:53.562 --> 21:57.149
I don't snitch.
Not to cops, not to reporters.

21:57.233 --> 21:58.818
Not to anybody.

21:58.901 --> 22:03.655
Leave me the fuck alone.

22:10.872 --> 22:11.998
Okay.

22:21.215 --> 22:24.051
Lincoln and Roosevelt
were progressive Republicans.

22:24.135 --> 22:26.387
Yeah!

22:26.470 --> 22:29.265
- Jefferson was a visionary conservative.
- Yeah!

22:29.348 --> 22:32.559
George Washington was
a strong commander in chief.

22:32.643 --> 22:33.852
Yeah!

22:33.936 --> 22:36.730
William Conway embodies
all these qualities.

22:36.813 --> 22:40.526
I proudly endorse
his candidacy for president,

22:40.609 --> 22:44.488
and I ask everyone in our great state
to do the same.

22:44.571 --> 22:47.909
The next President of the United States,
William Conway!

23:01.672 --> 23:05.634
I'm... I'm humbled by your endorsement,

23:05.717 --> 23:09.180
and by the legacy of these great men
behind me.

23:09.263 --> 23:12.683
Now, they all left very big shoes to fill.

23:12.766 --> 23:16.687
You know who hasn't
come even close to filling them?

23:16.770 --> 23:18.022
Frank Underwood.

23:38.334 --> 23:39.876
I should go.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.255
Once we land.

23:43.339 --> 23:45.924
I'll get a flight back to the East Coast.

23:47.343 --> 23:50.262
- Tom...
- You don't have to say anything.

24:20.501 --> 24:22.336
We've had eggs
thrown at the house.

24:22.419 --> 24:26.090
- Tomatoes, cow dung.
- You name it.

24:26.173 --> 24:28.592
South Dakota's big Conway country.

24:28.675 --> 24:31.303
We've been here all our lives.
We raised our son here.

24:31.387 --> 24:35.182
<i>- It's just beyond our experience.
- All these folks are our neighbors.</i>

24:35.266 --> 24:37.934
<i>But once I put that sign up...</i>

24:38.019 --> 24:42.148
Governor Conway is a veteran.
He has children.

24:42.231 --> 24:43.940
Why us and not him?

24:45.901 --> 24:48.654
When we saw you two at the convention...

24:48.737 --> 24:51.323
I don't know.
It just seemed like a real partnership.

24:56.537 --> 24:59.915
<i>Love. Deep, unwavering love.</i>

24:59.998 --> 25:05.254
I wanna thank you for reminding me
how important that kind of love is.

25:05.337 --> 25:08.965
Because it is.
It's easy to get caught up in the campaign

25:09.050 --> 25:13.512
and to forget how Francis
and I got here in the first place,

25:13.595 --> 25:16.014
to remember that we're not
just President and First Lady,

25:16.098 --> 25:18.100
or husband and wife.

25:18.184 --> 25:19.518
We're partners.

25:19.601 --> 25:23.855
We have made a choice
to tackle everything together.

25:25.732 --> 25:28.610
We go beyond what's pretty and perfect,

25:28.694 --> 25:32.406
beyond what's scary,
difficult and unknown.

25:32.489 --> 25:38.495
We're not just partners on the ticket.
We're partners in life.

25:40.206 --> 25:41.248
<i>Mr. President.</i>

25:41.332 --> 25:44.126
You have someone on the inside
of the House Intelligence Committee

25:44.210 --> 25:46.253
feeding you classified information.

25:46.337 --> 25:47.379
<i>I'm a sitting governor.</i>

25:47.463 --> 25:49.631
<i>There's nothing wrong
with staying informed.</i>

25:49.715 --> 25:52.551
Every Republican is against
the Russians being involved.

25:52.634 --> 25:54.886
You are interfering
with national security.

25:54.970 --> 25:56.638
I haven't influenced a single member.

25:56.722 --> 25:59.100
<i>Oh, that's because
you're having Brockhart do it.</i>

25:59.183 --> 26:01.768
If the general chooses
to share his expertise with them,

26:01.852 --> 26:02.978
<i>they're well served by it.</i>

26:03.061 --> 26:06.898
Fifty times a day,
you say we should destroy ICO,

26:06.982 --> 26:09.610
and now you're deliberately
preventing us from doing it.

26:09.693 --> 26:11.278
<i>You could've destroyed them
six months ago,</i>

26:11.362 --> 26:12.821
<i>so don't lay that at my...</i>

26:12.904 --> 26:15.073
I don't blame you
for being a fraud, Governor.

26:15.157 --> 26:17.743
<i>I mean, we all have to be hypocrites,
every now and then.</i>

26:17.826 --> 26:21.705
<i>But if you block this,
I'll send American troops in instead.</i>

26:21.788 --> 26:24.333
You won't send Americans.
Syria won't allow it.

26:24.416 --> 26:26.252
<i>I don't care what Syria will allow.</i>

26:26.335 --> 26:29.421
But wouldn't you rather have it be
Russians in harm's way,

26:29.505 --> 26:31.840
than your fellow American soldiers?

26:31.923 --> 26:36.178
If anyone gets killed,
that's going to be blood on your hands.

26:36.262 --> 26:39.640
You want me to tell the Republicans to...
get on board.

26:39.723 --> 26:45.646
<i>Or have the general do it.
Put politics aside and do the right thing.</i>

26:46.647 --> 26:48.774
Did you really think
you'd be able to convince me

26:48.857 --> 26:50.609
by making this call, Mr. President?

26:50.692 --> 26:54.363
<i>I'm ahead by double digits.
I got a message that's working.</i>

26:54.446 --> 26:57.073
<i>You're on your heels,
and you're asking me to help you</i>

26:57.158 --> 27:00.411
<i>by appealing to my sense of duty?</i>

27:00.494 --> 27:04.498
I've even got you sold on my message.

27:05.666 --> 27:09.085
Well, you shouldn't believe everything
you see on TV.

27:09.170 --> 27:12.214
<i>The governor has
ended the call, Mr. President.</i>

27:19.471 --> 27:21.640
Hmm, let's go.

27:24.100 --> 27:26.645
We're gonna go forward
with our own ground operation.

27:26.728 --> 27:30.649
I'll inform the Joint Chiefs.
Sir, there's another thing.

27:30.732 --> 27:33.902
The Intelligence Committee...
If Conway has someone on the inside...

27:33.985 --> 27:36.322
You're worried about oversight
on surveillance.

27:36.405 --> 27:38.282
There's increased attention.

27:38.365 --> 27:40.325
They dig around,
find out what Macallan's up to...

27:40.367 --> 27:43.787
- Yeah, but I thought we were airtight.
- LeAnn says we are, but still...

27:43.870 --> 27:46.290
The safest thing would be to end it.

27:49.835 --> 27:52.754
<i>Claire Underwood's
been on the move the past two days,</i>

27:52.838 --> 27:55.882
<i>showing up in every state
Governor Conway's held events.</i>

27:55.966 --> 27:58.594
<i>Absent from the trail
has been the president.</i>

27:58.677 --> 28:01.096
<i>Press Secretary Seth Grayson said, quote,</i>

28:01.179 --> 28:03.807
<i>"The president is attending
to the business of government</i>

28:03.890 --> 28:05.559
<i>for the time being," end quote.</i>

28:05.642 --> 28:09.730
<i>But he neglected to say when
the president would resume campaigning,</i>

28:09.813 --> 28:13.984
<i>and there are no upcoming events
currently listed on the campaign website,</i>

28:14.067 --> 28:16.945
<i>leading some to speculate
that the real reason for his absence</i>

28:17.028 --> 28:18.572
<i>may be health-related.</i>

28:18.655 --> 28:22.826
<i>It's been six months since the president
received a liver transplant.</i>

28:22.909 --> 28:24.703
<i>Although he was able
to resume normal...</i>

28:24.786 --> 28:28.957
- What happened to your eye?
- Freddy Hayes.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.585
So I assume he didn't talk.

28:31.668 --> 28:36.465
- I need a way in here, Mr. Danton.
- I've helped you as much as I can.

28:36.548 --> 28:38.592
I know you won't go on record.

28:40.010 --> 28:42.971
I'm not even asking
to put you on background.

28:44.515 --> 28:49.060
All I'm looking for
is whether I'm warm or cold.

28:52.481 --> 28:54.733
What kind of beer is that?

28:57.278 --> 29:01.948
A lager. Some microbrew they had, um...
I don't know the name.

29:02.032 --> 29:03.284
Mind if I try it?

29:06.870 --> 29:08.289
Go ahead.

29:16.422 --> 29:18.089
It's good.

29:19.508 --> 29:22.969
Used to play a drinking game
when I was a teenager...

29:23.053 --> 29:25.472
called Never Have I Ever.

29:25.556 --> 29:28.767
- You know that game?
- You drink when you have.

29:30.018 --> 29:31.562
That's the one.

29:33.855 --> 29:36.483
Or if the president has.

29:46.952 --> 29:51.498
Never have I ever perjured myself
when investigated by a special prosecutor.

30:03.885 --> 30:07.889
Never have I ever
struck a deal with Raymond Tusk...

30:07.973 --> 30:11.935
to perjure himself
in exchange for a pardon.

30:20.361 --> 30:23.322
Never have I ever conspired
to impeach a president

30:23.405 --> 30:25.907
so I could become president myself.

30:46.219 --> 30:47.846
We're gonna need more beer.

30:55.729 --> 30:59.315
- The First Lady is on line one, sir.
- Thank you.

31:03.779 --> 31:04.821
Claire.

31:04.905 --> 31:08.492
Doug called me
about sending in our own troops.

31:08.575 --> 31:12.120
Well, it was that, or sit on our hands.
Conway wouldn't budge.

31:12.203 --> 31:13.789
<i>And what does Cathy say?</i>

31:13.872 --> 31:15.707
I'm more interested
in hearing what you think.

31:15.791 --> 31:19.628
Well, I think... doing something
is better than doing nothing.

31:19.711 --> 31:22.839
<i>How are the events going?</i>

31:22.923 --> 31:26.885
It's hard to tell.
I've done so many, it's all a blur.

31:26.968 --> 31:29.596
There's only one interview left tonight,

31:29.680 --> 31:33.434
and then we're done for the day, but then
there's, uh... seven events tomorrow.

31:33.517 --> 31:35.561
<i>How are you holding up?</i>

31:39.022 --> 31:42.443
I called to tell you Tom's not working
on the campaign anymore.

31:43.694 --> 31:46.362
- Did he quit?
<i>- No.</i>

31:47.406 --> 31:48.782
What happened?

31:50.200 --> 31:52.619
We both decided it was for the best.

31:54.955 --> 31:57.583
<i>We don't have to worry about him, Francis.</i>

31:59.543 --> 32:01.420
You sound tired.

32:01.503 --> 32:03.343
Make sure you get
a full night's sleep tonight.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.676
- Francis?
<i>- Yes?</i>

32:10.345 --> 32:11.597
Nothing.

32:13.515 --> 32:16.184
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay, tomorrow.

32:41.502 --> 32:45.464
- You're certain Underwood knew?
- And Walker didn't.

32:45.547 --> 32:49.926
- Could Danton have some agenda on this?
- He has no reason to lie.

32:50.010 --> 32:54.723
- Who's corroborated, besides him?
- No one. That's why I'm here.

32:54.806 --> 32:59.019
I need institutional support.
Legal, research...

32:59.102 --> 33:01.688
a place to work
where my dog won't bark at me.

33:01.772 --> 33:03.982
If you crack this story,
you can do anything you want.

33:04.065 --> 33:08.945
- I'll even make you managing editor again.
- I don't want that.

33:09.029 --> 33:12.157
What I do want... is absolute autonomy.

33:13.033 --> 33:16.411
I build my team, I keep it small,
and I answer only to you.

33:16.495 --> 33:20.123
- How about security?
- Oh, this was just some bad luck.

33:20.206 --> 33:24.377
- I've lost two reporters, Tom.
- Oh, come on, Margaret.

33:24.460 --> 33:26.340
Underwood may be a crook,
but he's not a killer.

33:26.421 --> 33:28.423
I don't think so either,
but I don't wanna take any chances.

33:28.507 --> 33:31.092
You just get me the staff I need.

33:31.176 --> 33:33.762
Once this article comes out,
I'm untouchable.

33:33.845 --> 33:37.473
When the White House
starts throwing punches... lawyer up.

33:37.558 --> 33:40.644
'Cause he's gonna throw 'em
at the <i>Herald,</i> not me.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.501
Hobby I used to have.

34:06.252 --> 34:11.341
The Battle of the Wilderness.
I spent months building a model of it.

34:11.424 --> 34:14.219
Started another one,
but never finished it.

34:14.302 --> 34:16.847
- Why not?
- I became president.

34:16.929 --> 34:18.889
- Never enough time.
- Hmm.

34:21.266 --> 34:23.143
Does Claire know you asked me here?

34:24.145 --> 34:25.396
No.

34:37.868 --> 34:41.036
It was more than just a fling, wasn't it?

34:49.588 --> 34:53.257
- How did she describe it?
- I didn't ask.

34:54.760 --> 34:57.679
Well, I'm not gonna go into details.

34:57.763 --> 35:00.098
I respect you too much for that.

35:01.600 --> 35:06.730
When you two came back from Texas...

35:08.815 --> 35:10.566
I had a feeling.

35:13.069 --> 35:17.949
She says... you made her mother laugh.

35:18.033 --> 35:20.160
Yeah, I guess she took a liking to me.

35:22.287 --> 35:26.416
Christ, I haven't seen
that woman laugh in 30 years.

35:26.499 --> 35:28.376
I'm just not a threat.

35:29.961 --> 35:32.756
Just someone who didn't judge,
accepted her.

35:33.757 --> 35:35.300
Do you make Claire laugh?

35:38.637 --> 35:43.266
We have a connection.
Yeah... I make her laugh.

35:43.349 --> 35:45.268
I make her feel desired.

35:46.436 --> 35:50.565
I think she feels comfortable
being vulnerable around me.

35:51.650 --> 35:54.110
I have to say,
I'm a bit surprised you're not upset.

35:54.194 --> 35:57.530
- What would that achieve?
- I admire that, Frank.

36:00.659 --> 36:03.704
I got angry with an old friend yesterday

36:03.787 --> 36:06.497
for calling me "Frank"
instead of "Mr. President."

36:06.581 --> 36:07.916
Just for using your name?

36:09.960 --> 36:12.838
It wasn't the name, I suppose.

36:12.921 --> 36:15.298
It's the fact that he's leaving me.

36:16.675 --> 36:18.384
- Leaving you how?
- New job.

36:18.468 --> 36:23.473
- Hmm. He worked for you?
- Here in the White House.

36:25.058 --> 36:28.770
It's tough for employees
to be your friends.

36:30.772 --> 36:33.274
That's why I decided to end it.

36:37.528 --> 36:41.908
- You decided to leave.
- So that she wouldn't have to ask me to.

36:46.621 --> 36:48.749
And what about your book?

36:51.292 --> 36:53.128
I would never betray her like that.

36:58.466 --> 37:00.468
Thank you, Tom.

37:00.551 --> 37:04.389
- I'll walk you out.
- I know my way out.

37:04.472 --> 37:06.057
But thanks.

37:10.311 --> 37:12.147
Take care, Frank.

37:52.145 --> 37:55.481
Three teams.
North, east, and west.

37:55.565 --> 37:58.443
We'll triangulate
and advance on the center.

37:58.526 --> 38:00.403
Each team will have a field agent

38:00.486 --> 38:03.531
working with local assets
to locate the Ahmadis.

38:03.614 --> 38:05.826
Here's the executive order, sir.

38:19.464 --> 38:21.883
Do you have a preference?
Dead or alive?

38:21.967 --> 38:23.969
Alive, if we can get
intelligence out of 'em.

38:24.052 --> 38:26.012
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

38:32.435 --> 38:36.272
You're officially briefing me
on ICO-related surveillance activities.

38:36.356 --> 38:38.942
You never saw or spoke to the president.

38:41.652 --> 38:42.946
This way.

38:56.877 --> 38:58.211
Mr. Macallan.

38:59.629 --> 39:03.174
- Mr. President.
- The president's in his residence...

39:03.258 --> 39:04.509
not here.

39:05.760 --> 39:08.388
Security.
We have concerns.

39:08.471 --> 39:10.473
Conway has people
on House Intelligence.

39:10.556 --> 39:12.267
I've got everything masked.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.936
The algorithms for ICO
and the campaign are identical.

39:15.020 --> 39:17.397
It's just a matter
of what variables you input.

39:17.480 --> 39:19.440
Give me English.

39:19.524 --> 39:21.359
Uh...

39:23.945 --> 39:28.824
One spoon.
I can use it to stir my coffee...

39:28.909 --> 39:30.785
to eat soup...

39:32.162 --> 39:33.704
to boil heroin.

39:34.789 --> 39:39.544
All they see is the spoon,
not what I do with it.

39:39.627 --> 39:41.922
Or we could
just get rid of the spoon.

39:42.005 --> 39:46.134
Shut it down? Well, that would be a shame,
especially after yesterday.

39:46.842 --> 39:50.846
- What happened yesterday?
- Beyond happened.

39:51.806 --> 39:53.558
"Beyond"?

39:53.641 --> 39:57.020
What your wife said in South Dakota.

39:57.103 --> 39:59.855
"Beyond what's pretty and perfect."

39:59.940 --> 40:04.485
Liberation from convention,
from the past.

40:04.569 --> 40:08.406
Beyond surface, beyond bullshit,
beyond the election.

40:11.326 --> 40:14.329
- Beyond marriage.
- Yes, exactly.

40:16.664 --> 40:19.709
You're not just husband and wife.
You're not just running mates.

40:19.792 --> 40:22.587
You're both and more.

40:22.670 --> 40:24.880
You're what's possible.

40:24.965 --> 40:28.426
The Conways are everything
everyone wants to be.

40:29.344 --> 40:33.139
You're everything
everyone wants to become.

40:38.894 --> 40:42.941
The president has been shot.
He's had a liver transplant.

40:43.024 --> 40:46.444
And I'm sure everyone here
in Pittsburgh is wondering,

40:46.527 --> 40:49.030
what happens if he dies?

40:49.114 --> 40:51.866
Not to be indelicate, but...

40:51.950 --> 40:54.410
What if I became president?

40:54.494 --> 40:55.786
And that's fair.

40:56.412 --> 41:03.169
Our party chose me because they saw
one half of an indivisible team.

41:03.253 --> 41:05.255
Unconditional support.

41:05.338 --> 41:10.343
- Two people working together for years.
- Supporting each other is one thing.

41:10.426 --> 41:14.014
Experience is another.
You have very little.

41:15.390 --> 41:17.517
I can see from your ring
that you're married.

41:17.600 --> 41:20.645
- Yes. Eighteen years.
- So you know what real partnership is.

41:20.728 --> 41:23.439
We have 30 years under our belts.

41:23.523 --> 41:27.402
Learning from and advising each other?
I'd call that experience.

41:27.485 --> 41:31.156
Okay, so you've got a strong marriage,
but in terms of your qualifications...

41:31.239 --> 41:35.701
What... what I'm saying is that we need
to get beyond husband and wife.

41:35.785 --> 41:38.204
We need to look at the team.

41:38.288 --> 41:41.791
Francis has served in Congress,
in the White House.

41:41.874 --> 41:46.796
I've run a major nonprofit.
I served as ambassador.

41:46.879 --> 41:50.841
We have passed legislation,
developed policy.

41:50.925 --> 41:55.555
We've done all of that together,
every step of the way.

41:55.638 --> 41:58.349
So it's natural
that we would run together.

41:58.433 --> 42:00.851
And I know Francis better than anyone.

42:00.935 --> 42:04.689
So, if he died, to answer your question,

42:04.772 --> 42:07.733
who better to carry out
his plan for America?

42:07.817 --> 42:10.195
Manipulation.

42:10.278 --> 42:12.613
Deception.

42:12.697 --> 42:14.532
Corruption.

42:16.201 --> 42:19.870
That translates to abuse of power
and breaking the law.

42:22.165 --> 42:25.335
We know it's true,
but we need corroboration.

42:25.418 --> 42:28.379
People on record,
every fact researched

42:28.463 --> 42:31.466
and checked and double-checked.

42:33.426 --> 42:36.846
Nothing we discuss leaves this room.

42:38.514 --> 42:39.890
Not your friends, not your family,

42:39.974 --> 42:44.187
not the 50 reporters outside that door
who wanna know what we're doing in here.

42:45.271 --> 42:48.483
The second the White House
gets wind of what we're doing...

42:48.566 --> 42:51.069
they start to make this story...

42:53.404 --> 42:54.655
disappear.

42:55.656 --> 42:58.909
The radio interview you did
was spectacular.

42:58.993 --> 43:00.035
It felt good.

43:00.120 --> 43:02.455
I feel like we're finally
tapping into something.

43:02.538 --> 43:05.791
Was it Tom, what you said in South Dakota,
with the couple?

43:05.875 --> 43:08.253
I saw a videotape of it.

43:09.420 --> 43:12.840
The core of it, yes.
And then...

43:12.923 --> 43:14.884
I sort of made it my own.

43:16.177 --> 43:17.387
He should stay on.

43:17.470 --> 43:19.930
- No.
- Not as your speechwriter.

43:20.014 --> 43:23.058
Well, I mean, yes, to the rest
of the world, he can be our speechwriter.

43:23.143 --> 43:25.561
But that's not why he should stay on.

43:27.855 --> 43:30.108
He should stay on because...

43:31.567 --> 43:33.569
he can give you things that I can't.

43:33.653 --> 43:37.157
Look, Claire,
we've been a great team.

43:37.240 --> 43:39.033
But one person...

43:39.117 --> 43:43.663
one person cannot give
everything to another person.

43:44.872 --> 43:46.707
I can't travel with you.

43:47.917 --> 43:52.963
I don't keep you warm at night.
I don't see you the way he sees you.

43:54.174 --> 43:57.218
It... Look, it's not my permission
to give, but...

43:57.302 --> 43:59.595
you'll do what's right for you.

44:00.971 --> 44:04.892
But I want you to know, if you want it...

44:05.976 --> 44:07.687
I know you'll be careful...

44:08.813 --> 44:10.231
and I'll be fine.

44:10.315 --> 44:15.153
I mean, if we're gonna go
beyond marriage, let's go beyond it.

44:21.617 --> 44:24.537
<i>You have three saved messages.</i>

44:24.620 --> 44:26.789
<i>Message one. September 8th...</i>

44:27.832 --> 44:31.461
<i>Hi, uh, this is Laura Moretti
leaving a message for Douglas...</i>

44:32.378 --> 44:34.922
<i>To save this message,
press eight.</i>

44:35.840 --> 44:37.842
<i>To call back, press five.</i>

44:38.968 --> 44:40.845
<i>To...</i>

45:02.950 --> 45:07.288
I'm sorry.
Uh, my sitter was late, and, um...

45:07.372 --> 45:09.832
- and then there was traffic, so...
- Just relax.

45:09.915 --> 45:12.335
It's fine.

45:14.044 --> 45:15.713
It's so nice to meet you in person.

45:19.675 --> 45:20.885
Here.

45:24.514 --> 45:28.058
I don't know why I got them.
I guess I, uh...

45:29.226 --> 45:30.895
- Anyway.
- No, they're lovely.

45:30.978 --> 45:32.313
Thank you.

45:34.274 --> 45:38.611
And, uh... and thank you again...
for that donation.

45:38.694 --> 45:40.738
I just...
I can't tell you how much it means...

45:40.821 --> 45:43.073
You already thanked me
on your voice message

45:43.157 --> 45:44.867
and when we talked on the phone.

45:44.950 --> 45:48.037
You don't need to thank me anymore.

45:48.120 --> 45:50.540
Okay, no more thanks.

45:53.626 --> 45:55.378
I hope this place is okay.

45:55.461 --> 45:58.548
It's nothing fancy,
but I come here a lot.

45:58.631 --> 46:02.051
I like it.
It has a lot of character.

46:03.177 --> 46:06.138
Tony liked greasy spoons like this.

46:06.221 --> 46:10.810
He used to take the kids to, um...
Ben's Chili Bowl every Sunday afternoon

46:10.893 --> 46:12.728
and get them hot dogs.

46:14.104 --> 46:15.440
Sorry.

46:16.941 --> 46:18.818
Don't be.

46:19.485 --> 46:21.529
I probably just shouldn't talk
about my husband.

46:21.612 --> 46:24.281
I still get emotional.

46:25.616 --> 46:29.119
You can... if you want to.

46:31.372 --> 46:33.624
Even if I cry?

46:35.376 --> 46:37.503
I wanna know more about him.

46:47.597 --> 46:49.974
Will you close the doors, please?

47:03.779 --> 47:05.406
Where is he?

47:10.119 --> 47:12.121
Twice in two days I've been here.

47:13.373 --> 47:15.124
I know.

47:16.501 --> 47:18.503
So, why am I here now?

47:23.508 --> 47:25.300
I want you back.

47:31.432 --> 47:32.642
I want you back, too.

47:34.101 --> 47:35.478
But...

47:37.522 --> 47:39.189
He understands.
