WEBVTT

00:00.146 --> 00:02.100
Anything happens, you're on your own.

00:02.160 --> 00:04.019
We only have responsibility
for each other.

00:04.853 --> 00:08.292
Thank you. Makes my job of reporting
on who you kill, and how,

00:08.413 --> 00:09.692
and why, so much easier.

00:09.979 --> 00:12.019
You can't do that! It's my job.

00:12.099 --> 00:15.019
The target's code name is Starfish.
Abdul Kadir Hakim.

00:15.152 --> 00:16.751
He's brutal, he's clever.

00:16.776 --> 00:18.884
Who's that? Harvey Tilbrook.

00:18.909 --> 00:21.548
What does he do?
He's a big, fat spy.

00:21.587 --> 00:24.426
The Third Man!

00:24.452 --> 00:28.012
Of course, it means he's had
other girls, your handsome husband.

00:28.186 --> 00:31.265
You need to be... surprising.

00:31.780 --> 00:34.660
And unpredictable.

00:35.713 --> 00:38.033
I'm sorry about Nick Page.

00:41.079 --> 00:42.719
I'm pregnant.

00:43.620 --> 00:45.820
It's not Ed's.

00:47.073 --> 00:48.713
I'm going to tell him.

00:53.246 --> 00:56.445
Aden - where east meets west.

00:57.140 --> 01:01.460
Vital as an oil refinery,
as well as a Gulf trade route.

01:02.467 --> 01:04.827
The beach here at Aden is lovely.

01:05.358 --> 01:08.399
The sun is warm and the sharks
are not always hungry.

01:15.187 --> 01:17.714
The occasional outbreaks of
violence are caused by

01:17.739 --> 01:20.252
what are officially called
dissident tribesmen.

01:22.486 --> 01:25.365
As long as there's trouble,
there must be troops.

01:26.060 --> 01:29.565
The Queen has full confidence
in Aden's future,

01:29.590 --> 01:33.563
describing it as the perfect
example of colonial rule.

01:56.813 --> 01:58.373
Let's go!

02:27.199 --> 02:28.499
Here! In here!

02:28.524 --> 02:30.203
Just here, ma'am?

02:31.046 --> 02:32.525
Thank you so much!

02:32.550 --> 02:34.150
Just doing my job, ma'am.

02:36.100 --> 02:38.220
Yes. Thank you.

02:38.260 --> 02:39.780
Sure.

03:04.973 --> 03:09.020
Um... I was... I was just...
I was just delivering something.

03:11.060 --> 03:14.700
What... what I mean is I didn't know
you... I didn't know you'd be here.

03:14.740 --> 03:16.620
I'm glad you are, though.

03:20.566 --> 03:22.046
Er...

03:22.700 --> 03:23.700
For the deer.

03:24.926 --> 03:26.485
Deer?

03:27.166 --> 03:28.726
Christmas deer.

03:29.686 --> 03:32.125
Yes! Yeah, the reindeer!

03:32.179 --> 03:33.618
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

03:33.752 --> 03:35.751
The reindeer have names, you know.

03:35.776 --> 03:38.364
Yeah. Um... Rudolf,

03:38.660 --> 03:43.540
er... Dancer, Dasher, Comet, Cupid.

03:43.580 --> 03:45.979
Comet. Koopid.

03:45.980 --> 03:48.060
No. CyuCyupid.

03:48.100 --> 03:50.070
Cupid. Cupid, that's it.

03:50.133 --> 03:51.653
Cupid.

03:53.986 --> 03:55.786
I have to go.

03:55.811 --> 03:57.691
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

03:58.100 --> 04:00.180
Sorry.

04:17.326 --> 04:19.485
What time will he get to Aden?

04:19.510 --> 04:24.110
Er... well, he sets off from
Greenland at around three o'clock,

04:24.500 --> 04:28.420
so... Daddy says he lives at
the North Pole. Didn't you, Daddy?

04:29.673 --> 04:32.753
He's right.
What am I thinking? Greenland!

04:35.100 --> 04:37.579
You wouldn't lie to me, would you?

04:37.580 --> 04:40.419
Father Christmas will be here to
put your presents in your stocking,

04:40.420 --> 04:43.539
provided you're asleep
when he gets here.

04:43.540 --> 04:46.539
And tomorrow, he'll be at
the BP Club, I promise you.

04:47.060 --> 04:49.300
Bath time, George. Off you go.

04:54.700 --> 04:57.860
Well, I believe you.
Father Christmas definitely exists.

04:57.900 --> 04:59.579
We've got him, Joe.

04:59.580 --> 05:01.539
Sorry, sir?

05:01.540 --> 05:04.460
Starfish. Kadir Hakim.

05:05.900 --> 05:08.700
The Paras picked him up last night.
We've got the bastard.

05:11.380 --> 05:12.820
That's, er...

05:14.780 --> 05:18.740
It'll certainly help the men
deal with... what happened.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.860
I can't put it out of my mind.

05:24.900 --> 05:26.100
His head.

05:28.620 --> 05:29.980
Who would do such a thing?

05:34.340 --> 05:36.660
What kind of...?
Listen, about that reporter.

05:38.140 --> 05:40.139
The world cannot see
the photographs she took.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.660
This comes from the top, Joe.

05:41.700 --> 05:44.579
She shouldn't have been there, she
shouldn't have seen what she saw.

05:44.580 --> 05:46.380
And those pictures are...

05:48.220 --> 05:50.100
Just see to it, would you?
There's a good chap.

05:52.740 --> 05:54.580
I have to go out.

05:56.140 --> 05:58.820
I might be some time.

05:58.860 --> 06:00.460
Can I ask what it is?

06:02.620 --> 06:04.340
Checking on one of the men.

06:04.380 --> 06:07.180
What's the matter with him? You
should learn not to ask, darling.

06:11.460 --> 06:13.139
He's a long way from home.

06:13.140 --> 06:15.099
I could come with you and talk to him.

06:15.100 --> 06:17.459
I could come as your wife and...

06:17.460 --> 06:21.060
Makes it sound like
it's a part I'm playing.

06:21.100 --> 06:24.220
"She comes as
Captain Martin's wife". It's fine.

06:25.460 --> 06:27.900
It's not really a wife thing.

06:32.500 --> 06:33.940
Don't wait up.

06:39.140 --> 06:41.380
It's Christmas Eve!

07:30.500 --> 07:32.900
Maybe Life Magazine will do a profile.

07:34.500 --> 07:37.379
The private life of a private soldier.

07:37.380 --> 07:38.980
In real close.

07:39.020 --> 07:41.220
Honestly? Sure.

07:42.660 --> 07:44.460
Let me ask you something.

07:44.500 --> 07:46.260
Why are you here?

07:48.340 --> 07:49.940
Because I like you.

07:54.180 --> 07:55.820
You meant Aden.

07:55.860 --> 07:57.900
You meant, why are we here in Aden?

08:00.540 --> 08:02.499
Do me a favour.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.539
Take this. Don't come back.

08:04.540 --> 08:07.020
Get up and walk away now.
Don't look behind you.

08:07.060 --> 08:08.820
Take the back alley.

08:16.580 --> 08:18.379
Where's Lance Corporal Stoneham?

08:18.380 --> 08:20.020
I ate him alive.

08:23.060 --> 08:26.980
I'm afraid those photographs
you took can't be published.

08:27.020 --> 08:29.339
I'm interested in one thing -
the truth.

08:29.340 --> 08:31.139
Can I have the film, please?

08:31.140 --> 08:33.220
Or what?

08:33.260 --> 08:35.020
I'm asking politely.

08:36.620 --> 08:39.499
You know, I think, finally,
I understand

08:39.500 --> 08:41.339
how much distance there is

08:41.340 --> 08:45.139
between what's said and what's meant
when an Englishman opens his mouth.

08:45.140 --> 08:47.459
You're threatening me.
How would you feel if you saw

08:47.460 --> 08:50.060
a picture of your brother's head
on a spike in a Sunday newspaper?

08:50.100 --> 08:53.540
You're not here representing the
interests of the Dimarco family.

08:55.740 --> 08:58.219
Corporal Dimarco has three sisters.

08:58.220 --> 09:01.859
The youngest is called Elaine.
She's nine years old.

09:01.860 --> 09:04.299
If she were to ever see
those photographs...

09:04.300 --> 09:06.339
I'll use the other ones.

09:06.340 --> 09:08.980
The dead soldiers.
They make the same point.

09:11.100 --> 09:13.419
Which is?

09:13.420 --> 09:14.740
This is a war.

09:16.060 --> 09:18.899
Your government would like us
to call it something else.

09:18.900 --> 09:21.419
A little "local difficulty".

09:21.420 --> 09:24.580
But these pictures and this reporter
tell us otherwise.

09:24.620 --> 09:26.659
The thirdbusiest port in the world

09:26.660 --> 09:28.859
and the most strategically important

09:28.860 --> 09:31.619
doesn't want to be a part
of the British Empire any more.

09:41.500 --> 09:44.340
Is the capture of Abdul Kadir Hakim
supposed to be secret?

09:46.180 --> 09:49.180
Because my waiter knows,
and he's not happy.

09:51.820 --> 09:53.420
My nose needs powdering.

10:10.980 --> 10:13.779
Hey! What do you think
you're doing?! How dare you!

10:13.780 --> 10:15.180
Thief! Harami!

10:15.220 --> 10:17.579
OK. This man was trying to steal
the bag!

10:17.580 --> 10:19.459
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

10:19.460 --> 10:21.259
It's all right. It's OK, it's OK.

10:21.260 --> 10:23.500
OK. No, no, no. Stay back!

10:23.540 --> 10:25.179
Stay back!

10:33.420 --> 10:35.100
Thief!

10:36.740 --> 10:38.740
He looked in my bag.

10:45.780 --> 10:47.739
Just below the wrist,
off with the hand.

10:49.860 --> 10:54.100
But the victim has the power
of forgiveness.

10:54.140 --> 10:56.340
And I'm the victim.

11:21.660 --> 11:24.460
The World Through A Tear
by Neil Sedaka.

12:01.300 --> 12:04.060
Do you remember Berlin?

12:06.500 --> 12:08.820
Don't. Why not?

12:14.220 --> 12:15.860
It was a long time ago.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.220
Is it very painful?

12:28.900 --> 12:30.380
You must be missing him terribly.

12:35.780 --> 12:37.499
Is it so obvious?

12:37.500 --> 12:39.620
It's everything you say and do.

12:46.940 --> 12:48.660
You don't mind if I join you?

12:56.260 --> 12:57.900
He was good to me.

13:00.140 --> 13:01.219
Nick.

13:02.900 --> 13:05.820
I've wondered... I was wondering
whether it was guilt, or...

13:08.420 --> 13:10.820
But I don't think it was, you know,
I think he just liked me.

13:16.580 --> 13:19.020
Ed, you don't have to do...
No, of course.

13:20.860 --> 13:22.260
I love you.

13:27.180 --> 13:29.140
Part of me was pleased when he died.

13:42.940 --> 13:44.500
Maybe this won't work.

13:51.540 --> 13:52.940
Ed...?

14:02.620 --> 14:04.499
Come on.

14:04.500 --> 14:07.139
Ali, if you can't talk to me,
I mean, if you can't...

14:07.140 --> 14:09.380
talk to your own husband,

14:09.420 --> 14:13.219
then, I don't know, just... Your new
friend, Honor? I mean, she...

14:13.220 --> 14:16.460
I had hopes, but, um... What?

14:16.500 --> 14:17.940
Joe warned her off me.

14:17.980 --> 14:21.139
It's the usual thing.

14:21.140 --> 14:23.219
Rank.

14:23.220 --> 14:26.860
Can't keep you in line
if she's too close to me.

14:28.140 --> 14:29.340
He said that?

14:32.380 --> 14:33.780
He said that!

14:45.780 --> 14:48.819
Is he here?
Um... no. Where is he?

14:48.820 --> 14:50.940
He's talking to one of the men.

14:52.460 --> 14:54.899
Really? Why... why are you...?

14:54.900 --> 14:57.540
You know, Alison, she likes you.
She really likes you.

15:04.100 --> 15:05.860
You want to come down to ours
for a drink?

15:05.900 --> 15:09.539
I don't know how to put this, but my husband
doesn't think... Isn't here on Christmas Eve.

15:09.540 --> 15:12.980
Now, we'd both really like the
pleasure of your company because...

15:15.220 --> 15:16.220
we would.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.739
You know Stoneham's
half in love with you?

15:22.740 --> 15:25.579
Only half? I thought
I was doing better than that.

15:25.580 --> 15:27.020
You're using him.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.019
That's obvious.

15:29.020 --> 15:31.139
That's life.
It's what everyone does.

15:31.140 --> 15:34.379
A cynical view. Anyone who's
any good has a ruthless heart.

15:34.380 --> 15:37.539
They just may not want to admit
to it. Ruthlessness is...

15:37.540 --> 15:40.219
Halfadozen ghost soldiers
facedown in the sand,

15:40.220 --> 15:43.740
Corporal Dimarco's head on a stake
in the middle of the desert.

15:43.780 --> 15:46.260
They're great photographs.

15:46.300 --> 15:47.580
Mea culpa, Joe.

15:49.940 --> 15:51.140
I confess.

15:53.420 --> 15:54.980
I'll tell you where the film is.

15:56.260 --> 15:59.179
On the condition you meet me tomorrow.

15:59.180 --> 16:02.140
Why would you do that?
This isn't a game!

16:02.180 --> 16:03.780
Isn't it?

16:06.540 --> 16:07.899
Tomorrow is Christmas Day.

16:07.900 --> 16:11.859
On which everyone is required
to behave in exactly the same way.

16:11.860 --> 16:14.300
Eating the same food,
singing the same songs,

16:14.340 --> 16:16.819
praising the same great leader.

16:16.820 --> 16:20.019
Christmas Day is like going
to live in a oneparty state.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.300
You can do that.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.780
Or you could be with me.

16:50.700 --> 16:52.620
Hello? Harry, it's me.

16:52.660 --> 16:56.180
Mary. The electricity's off here
and the phone's out...

16:57.420 --> 16:59.659
Mary?

16:59.660 --> 17:01.659
Hello? ..Please.

17:01.660 --> 17:03.739
Hello? Mary, can you hear me? Daddy?

17:03.740 --> 17:05.500
Not now.

17:05.540 --> 17:07.300
George, come on! Hello?

17:23.940 --> 17:25.898
Bang! Got you, Daddy! Jesus Christ!

17:25.900 --> 17:27.138
Yusra!

17:27.140 --> 17:30.299
Right, George,
bed now or Santa won't come.

17:30.300 --> 17:33.139
I haven't got it.
I think that's unlikely to be true.

17:33.140 --> 17:35.180
I haven't got the film, sir.

17:35.220 --> 17:38.820
I could have you courtmartialled,
Stoneham, if you keep this up.

17:42.300 --> 17:43.899
She's playing you along.

17:43.900 --> 17:47.140
You think she'd really be
interested in you?

17:47.180 --> 17:49.179
She's using you.

17:49.180 --> 17:51.020
She's a journalist, it's what they do.

18:00.860 --> 18:02.740
I'm sorry, sir.

18:34.820 --> 18:36.100
I know you're awake.

18:38.340 --> 18:39.699
Shall I read to you?

18:39.700 --> 18:42.580
I have to be asleep
or Santa won't come.

18:42.620 --> 18:44.420
Maybe don't try so hard.

18:44.460 --> 18:45.660
How do you get to sleep?

18:47.140 --> 18:50.420
I listen to the breathing of my little
brother, who sleeps next to me.

18:51.780 --> 18:53.860
Can I visit your house one day?

18:56.020 --> 18:58.220
Um... I don't think that's possible.

18:58.260 --> 19:01.900
Why not? Um...

19:01.940 --> 19:05.739
But, um... Green Teddy
could come visit my house

19:05.740 --> 19:08.819
and then he could tell you about it.
What do you think?

19:08.820 --> 19:10.900
Really? Tonight? Why not?

19:10.940 --> 19:12.580
Yes! It's a good idea.

19:31.340 --> 19:33.540
There you are!
I'm looking for your wife.

19:35.860 --> 19:37.580
I think she's in there.

19:43.140 --> 19:44.539
Come in! The door's open!

19:46.780 --> 19:50.059
Er, excuse me,
our nanny needs to leave,

19:50.060 --> 19:53.459
so, Honor, I wondered
if you might look after George?

19:53.460 --> 19:55.659
So I can get to the hospital.

19:55.660 --> 19:58.020
Of course. Is she all right?

20:14.780 --> 20:17.220
Ali, why don't you go with Honor?

20:18.820 --> 20:19.900
Keep her company.

20:39.020 --> 20:41.300
Joe, did you deal with that reporter?

20:42.500 --> 20:44.259
Yes, sir.

20:44.260 --> 20:47.300
Once you start, it's hard to stop,
you know.

20:47.340 --> 20:49.340
Sir? The secret's not to start.

20:49.380 --> 20:51.779
Sweating, old chap..

20:51.780 --> 20:52.780
Reporter?

20:54.620 --> 20:57.099
Yes, er, confession...

20:57.100 --> 20:59.980
I'm afraid I sent your husband out
to chat up another woman,

21:00.020 --> 21:01.740
all for Queen and country, of course.

21:06.220 --> 21:07.819
So, you got the film?

21:07.820 --> 21:09.860
Yes. And destroyed it?

21:11.100 --> 21:12.699
Yes, sir.

21:12.700 --> 21:13.700
Good man.

21:47.380 --> 21:48.900
Who came before you?

21:50.340 --> 21:52.220
Who was the one he didn't marry?

21:52.260 --> 21:54.660
I don't know.

21:54.700 --> 21:56.180
He hasn't said?

21:56.220 --> 21:57.220
He loves me.

21:59.620 --> 22:01.899
We're in love, that's all.

22:01.900 --> 22:04.979
Well, that's all we've done, really,
is get married, and be in love,

22:04.980 --> 22:06.619
we haven't talked.

22:06.620 --> 22:07.620
But you will.

22:14.740 --> 22:16.180
I'll miss my parents tomorrow.

22:18.020 --> 22:21.179
They did me a stocking every year,
even though I'm...

22:21.180 --> 22:23.820
even though I'm... I'm...
I'm not a child.

22:25.420 --> 22:27.420
A satsuma with a penny in the bottom.

22:28.540 --> 22:30.300
Sorry, I'm talking too much.

22:35.820 --> 22:39.819
The one thing the army offers
by throwing us women together

22:39.820 --> 22:42.659
with nothing to do in dangerous places?

22:42.660 --> 22:43.660
Proper friendship.

22:46.260 --> 22:49.420
Don't tell Joe about what I said
about missing Mummy and Daddy.

22:51.820 --> 22:54.099
I can tell you now,
if you lead your life doing

22:54.100 --> 22:56.699
everything your husband wants,
nothing he doesn't want,

22:56.700 --> 22:59.339
and without the friendship
of women, 30 years from now,

22:59.340 --> 23:01.580
you'll wake up on
the first day of his retirement

23:01.620 --> 23:03.219
and realise you hate him.

23:03.220 --> 23:05.020
And worse than that, hate yourself.

23:09.780 --> 23:11.339
I should check on George.

23:16.540 --> 23:19.260
Alison, take your shoes off
or you'll wake him up! Sh!

23:22.460 --> 23:23.740
Has he been?

23:25.180 --> 23:26.460
Who's that?

23:26.500 --> 23:28.419
Father Christmas.

23:28.420 --> 23:30.420
No.

23:30.460 --> 23:32.259
You smell nice.

23:32.260 --> 23:35.580
Thank you. That's called gin.

23:35.620 --> 23:36.660
I like it.

23:36.700 --> 23:39.579
Good. Go to sleep!

23:39.580 --> 23:43.659
If my mummy wasn't my mummy
I'd want you.

23:47.500 --> 23:53.619
Your mother is a wonderful woman
and she loves you very much.

23:53.620 --> 23:56.820
How do babies come
out of their mummies?

23:57.940 --> 24:00.579
Er, they come out of our tummies.

24:00.580 --> 24:02.940
No, they don't. Alison!

24:02.980 --> 24:04.700
They come out of our vaginas.

24:04.740 --> 24:06.140
Er...

24:09.460 --> 24:11.660
Are you going to be a mummy?

24:17.020 --> 24:19.140
George?

24:19.180 --> 24:20.580
Yes?

24:20.620 --> 24:22.459
There's something you need to know.

24:22.460 --> 24:25.860
Alison, I...
You should sit up for this.

24:25.900 --> 24:28.340
What is it?
Alison, honestly, I don't...

24:28.380 --> 24:30.460
Father Christmas doesn't exist.

24:32.060 --> 24:33.499
No...! No!

24:33.500 --> 24:36.340
No, he does. He does. Listen to me.

24:36.380 --> 24:38.300
She doesn't know
what she's talking about.

24:38.340 --> 24:40.059
He does exist.

24:40.060 --> 24:41.620
Look at me, George.

24:42.700 --> 24:44.539
Father Christmas is real.

24:46.820 --> 24:48.220
Promise.

24:48.260 --> 24:49.940
Now go to sleep or he won't come.

24:51.300 --> 24:52.860
Get to sleep.

25:00.220 --> 25:01.780
I'm sure it's fine, sir.

25:04.220 --> 25:06.380
I'm sorry to drag you out
on Christmas Eve.

25:08.060 --> 25:09.420
I'm Jewish, sir.

25:11.540 --> 25:12.820
Yes.

25:12.860 --> 25:14.780
Of course. Sorry.

25:22.780 --> 25:25.459
So, what will you do on Christmas Day?

25:25.460 --> 25:27.459
Prepare for a full kit inspection.

25:27.460 --> 25:31.099
That's a bit harsh on yourself -
you're polishing your Sam Brown

25:31.100 --> 25:33.099
while everyone else is having fun.

25:33.100 --> 25:35.419
I was a kindertransport child, sir.

25:35.420 --> 25:37.979
Great Britain took me in
when I was 13 years old.

25:37.980 --> 25:40.659
I owe my new country everything
including my life,

25:40.660 --> 25:43.899
so, once a year, while everyone else
is busy pulling crackers

25:43.900 --> 25:47.339
and eating turkey, I take the time
to contemplate my good fortune.

25:47.340 --> 25:49.380
Who carried out
the inspection last year?

25:50.380 --> 25:52.020
Captain Page last year.

25:54.020 --> 25:56.700
Sir, you should go and see your wife.

25:58.900 --> 26:02.859
1900 hours, tomorrow. Be ready
for my inspection, Corporal.

26:02.860 --> 26:04.460
Sir. Yes, sir.

26:13.100 --> 26:15.180
Take me home for Christmas,
Harry Markham.

26:21.300 --> 26:23.299
How's your ankle, Corporal Armstrong?

26:23.300 --> 26:25.100
Much better, thank you, ma'am.

26:27.180 --> 26:29.500
Thank you. Ma'am.

26:30.820 --> 26:32.259
Your father?

26:32.260 --> 26:33.739
Er, the same.

26:33.740 --> 26:35.380
You know. He's fine.

26:37.860 --> 26:39.339
How's my husband?

26:41.980 --> 26:43.819
It's good to have you back, Mrs M.

27:12.660 --> 27:14.820
I'll just go and see George.

27:35.820 --> 27:37.860
Hello, young man.

28:24.980 --> 28:26.860
Teach me to sing.

28:28.940 --> 28:30.420
Teach me to smoke.

29:11.500 --> 29:12.700
Hello.

30:23.580 --> 30:27.060
Once In Royal David's City.

30:29.500 --> 30:31.220
What time is it?

30:33.140 --> 30:34.380
It's Christmas Day.

30:39.860 --> 30:42.380
I got him his, erm...

30:42.420 --> 30:44.020
his stamps.

30:45.300 --> 30:47.539
They're AustroHungarian Empire.

30:47.540 --> 30:49.580
What? Nothing.

30:49.620 --> 30:50.700
What?

30:50.740 --> 30:53.660
Well, they're for you, really,
aren't they, darling?

31:09.300 --> 31:11.699
Sorry! Should I...? Should I go?

31:11.700 --> 31:13.860
No, no, it's fine.
We'll, erm... Well, no, no.

31:13.900 --> 31:16.379
No, no, you stay here,
I'll... We'll both stay here

31:16.380 --> 31:18.940
and I'll just... I won't look.

31:23.740 --> 31:25.299
Good grief, George!

31:25.300 --> 31:27.739
Hello. Hello.

31:27.740 --> 31:31.019
Father Christmas won't come
if he's crying like that.

31:31.020 --> 31:33.979
Darling, darling, darling.

31:33.980 --> 31:35.900
Ssh.

31:35.940 --> 31:37.739
He's not real, anyway.

31:37.740 --> 31:39.380
Who told you that?

31:39.420 --> 31:41.059
Mrs Laithwaite.

31:44.380 --> 31:47.259
Now, you listen to your father.
What have I said to you?

31:47.260 --> 31:49.900
You promised he'd come.
And have I ever broken a promise?

31:51.900 --> 31:53.380
Back to bed.

31:58.460 --> 32:01.060
Where are you going?
I won't be long.

32:07.060 --> 32:08.179
Baxter!

32:08.180 --> 32:09.420
Sir?

32:10.780 --> 32:13.259
I need you to do something for me.

32:13.260 --> 32:15.100
Above and beyond the call of duty.

32:59.220 --> 33:01.819
Now, how much can we fit
in there?

33:01.820 --> 33:04.300
Little George has been a very good boy.

33:40.860 --> 33:45.500
By arresting Hakim,
you have kicked a hornets' nest.

33:45.540 --> 33:48.180
Well, I'm just surprised
he evaded us as long as he did.

33:48.220 --> 33:50.780
He had help. From who?

33:51.860 --> 33:55.860
A village, 12 miles west of
the base. What kind of a village?

33:57.420 --> 34:00.539
Goats and goatherds. NLF?

34:00.540 --> 34:03.579
A growing influence.

34:03.580 --> 34:05.620
So they'll be looking for revenge?

34:06.580 --> 34:07.860
Sooner or later.

34:09.100 --> 34:10.260
It looks that way.

34:20.860 --> 34:22.260
Go! Go!

34:38.139 --> 34:39.420
He knows me.

34:44.179 --> 34:45.219
Ed...

34:49.260 --> 34:51.018
- Do it!
- Please...

34:51.020 --> 34:52.219
Do it.

35:04.500 --> 35:05.980
He knows me.

35:10.620 --> 35:13.860
In The Bleak Midwinter.

36:18.660 --> 36:23.139
May the joys of the angels,
the eagerness of the shepherds,

36:23.140 --> 36:25.419
the perseverance of the wise men,

36:25.420 --> 36:28.300
the obedience of Joseph and Mary

36:28.340 --> 36:32.380
and the peace of the Christ child
be yours this Christmas.

36:32.420 --> 36:34.779
And the blessing of God Almighty
and the Father,

36:34.780 --> 36:37.379
the Son and the Holy Spirit...

36:37.380 --> 36:38.580
I was wrong.

36:40.580 --> 36:43.659
What, when you said...
I am a mistake.

36:43.660 --> 36:47.340
Yusra... It's not possible.

36:47.380 --> 36:49.940
Please leave alone.
No, hang on, I don't understand.

36:56.020 --> 36:58.060
Do not read this until tomorrow.

37:00.500 --> 37:02.300
But... Promise me.

37:08.940 --> 37:10.220
Yusra...?

37:10.260 --> 37:13.420
Almighty God, by whose grace
we are called to positions

37:13.460 --> 37:15.499
of responsibility and trust...

37:15.500 --> 37:18.380
If you want to sit and start
on the melon, um, yeah?

37:18.420 --> 37:20.620
George, shall we go to the table?

37:22.940 --> 37:24.339
I love melon.

37:24.340 --> 37:25.900
Yeah, watch that shirt.

37:25.940 --> 37:27.939
Don't tell anyone.

37:27.940 --> 37:30.099
I'm pregnant.

37:30.100 --> 37:33.820
It's nice to see you both
praising the Lord with such gusto.

37:33.860 --> 37:35.660
Well, I like the words.

37:35.700 --> 37:37.660
I've always loved Blake.

37:37.700 --> 37:39.899
It's Christina Rossetti.

37:39.900 --> 37:41.700
I'm sure it's Blake.

37:41.740 --> 37:43.940
All right, Harry.
Let's just say it's Blake.

37:51.700 --> 37:52.899
Ready for Grace?

37:52.900 --> 37:54.220
George.

38:03.340 --> 38:08.140
For what we are about to receive
may the Lord make us truly thankful.

38:08.180 --> 38:09.780
Amen.

38:14.340 --> 38:15.860
Do you believe in God, Honor?

38:15.900 --> 38:17.700
Of course she does.

38:19.580 --> 38:20.860
Yes, it's a good way to live.

38:20.900 --> 38:25.020
No one could disagree with that.
Love thy neighbour and so on.

38:25.060 --> 38:26.419
Do you think?

38:26.420 --> 38:29.459
Alison... Whoever they are, Mary?

38:29.460 --> 38:31.580
Whoever your neighbour happens to be?

38:32.780 --> 38:35.380
How about Josef Mengele?

38:35.420 --> 38:37.339
Should the family Schmidt

38:37.340 --> 38:40.859
next door to the monster doctor
love Joe Mengele?

38:40.860 --> 38:43.060
Or Joseph Stalin?

38:43.100 --> 38:47.140
Should the Dimitrievs at 21A
love the man next door?

38:47.180 --> 38:50.779
Just to stick with the Josephs.
Stupidest advice I ever heard.

38:50.780 --> 38:54.020
I'm in favour of hating
those who deserve to be hated.

38:54.060 --> 38:55.979
Can we open another bottle,
Honor, darling?

38:55.980 --> 38:58.340
Maybe we should wait for the turkey.
Alison wants a drink.

39:00.740 --> 39:01.860
It's Christmas.

39:01.900 --> 39:05.620
Believing in God is about
as intelligent as believing

39:05.660 --> 39:07.659
in Father Christmas.

39:07.660 --> 39:10.939
Father Christmas IS real.

39:10.940 --> 39:13.139
Is he? Indeed he is, George.

39:13.140 --> 39:15.460
You see how easy it is
if you catch them young enough?

39:15.500 --> 39:18.259
You see how you can get small human
beings believing anything...

39:18.260 --> 39:21.899
Do you know what I say... Do you
know what Alfred Hitchcock says?

39:21.900 --> 39:24.020
The most terrifying thing
he's ever seen?

39:25.220 --> 39:26.659
A priest...

39:26.660 --> 39:29.780
talking to young children.

39:30.661 --> 39:33.139
Run for your lives!
What do you say to that, Harry?

39:33.140 --> 39:34.899
Father Christmas IS real.

39:34.900 --> 39:37.339
No, that's something
called faith, George.

39:37.340 --> 39:39.499
I saw him last night in my bedroom.

39:39.500 --> 39:42.299
The crackers!
We haven't pulled the crackers.

39:46.500 --> 39:48.500
George? Ready? Can you reach?

39:48.540 --> 39:52.260
Merry Christmas, everyone.
Merry Christmas. One, two, three!

39:52.300 --> 39:54.980
Listen, everyone,
Simple Simon says touch your toes.

39:55.020 --> 39:56.379
Sir.

39:56.380 --> 39:59.059
Simple Simon says clap your hands.

40:00.900 --> 40:03.139
Simple Simon says rub your tummy.

40:03.140 --> 40:04.299
Pat your head.

40:04.300 --> 40:05.979
No!

40:08.540 --> 40:10.179
Can we go now?

40:10.180 --> 40:13.899
I think the Markhams might skip
the BP Club this Christmas.

40:13.900 --> 40:16.339
Mummy! George. But... George!

40:16.340 --> 40:19.260
Well, we could take George.
I could look after him.

40:19.300 --> 40:22.780
It would be such a shame for him
to miss out on all the fun.

40:27.900 --> 40:30.620
It's not funny! It's funny.

40:30.660 --> 40:32.179
Can we swim to the raft?

40:32.180 --> 40:35.179
I'm sorry, George.

40:35.180 --> 40:37.059
I'm not a very strong swimmer.

40:37.060 --> 40:42.500
Maybe if you ask nicely, Joe
will bring you? Please! Joe?

40:43.980 --> 40:45.380
Er...

40:45.420 --> 40:47.100
Go on! Please?

40:47.140 --> 40:48.380
Yes!

40:51.620 --> 40:54.939
Shop Around by The Miracles.

41:04.620 --> 41:06.459
Where are you off to, young man?

41:06.460 --> 41:07.940
We're just going to check the film.

41:25.820 --> 41:30.260
You remember what we arranged? They want you
to talk on the crisis of faith. What's that?

41:30.300 --> 41:32.060
I thought you'd know,
you're a writer.

41:32.100 --> 41:34.939
Of course you do. Goodnight, old
man. I've forgotten my hat.

41:34.940 --> 41:36.540
Hello, Harvey. Mrs Martin.

41:39.900 --> 41:41.979
Merry Christmas.

41:41.980 --> 41:43.060
Enjoy The Third Man.

41:46.940 --> 41:50.780
Where's Lassie? It's ALWAYS Lassie.

41:52.820 --> 41:54.940
Well, shall we find you some ice cream?

41:54.980 --> 41:57.900
And then we can put your trunks on,
do you think that's a good idea?

41:57.940 --> 41:59.380
Yeah? Yes!

42:01.260 --> 42:03.980
Tell me about your new American friend.

42:04.020 --> 42:07.140
There isn't much to say.
Have you plans to meet up again?

42:09.100 --> 42:10.699
No plans.

42:10.700 --> 42:11.900
Excuse me.

42:11.940 --> 42:13.540
Sorry, thank you.

42:18.540 --> 42:20.899
All of us are asked on
this special day

42:20.900 --> 42:23.660
to choose our own favourite carol.

42:23.700 --> 42:26.340
And this is my choice.
O Come All Ye Faithful...

42:28.380 --> 42:30.179
a child in Canterbury.

42:30.180 --> 42:33.219
A carol for the ages,
I hope you'll agree.

42:33.220 --> 42:35.300
O Come All Ye Faithful.

42:38.940 --> 42:40.259
Markham.

42:40.260 --> 42:48.260
Yes.

42:51.500 --> 42:53.140
Thank you.

42:54.780 --> 42:55.980
Everything all right?

42:59.140 --> 43:00.820
I have to go to the BP Club.

43:00.860 --> 43:02.300
Why?

43:07.980 --> 43:13.140
Always Something There
To Remind Me by Sandie Shaw.

43:24.660 --> 43:26.420
Your wife, she's, er...

43:30.140 --> 43:31.700
What? My wife's what?

43:32.900 --> 43:34.140
She's, er...

43:38.460 --> 43:41.699
What's the word you're finding
so hard to say, Joe?

43:41.700 --> 43:43.940
She drinks too much.

43:46.220 --> 43:47.580
Maybe not enough.

43:49.820 --> 43:51.260
She's embarrassing herself...

43:52.660 --> 43:54.260
and you... No!

43:54.300 --> 43:55.860
Not me. I'm not embarrassed.

44:02.820 --> 44:04.180
It's Christmas Day.

44:04.220 --> 44:07.899
I don't want this to...

44:07.900 --> 44:09.700
Spit it out, Joe.

44:12.180 --> 44:13.780
Just go and tap him on the back.

44:15.260 --> 44:17.220
Joe, can we swim to the raft now?

44:18.380 --> 44:19.660
Please?

44:21.540 --> 44:23.740
Come on, Joe, don't be embarrassed.

44:23.780 --> 44:25.780
Go on, Joe, you promised.

44:29.940 --> 44:31.260
OK.

44:42.060 --> 44:43.780
Congratulations.

44:47.020 --> 44:48.020
Alison told me.

44:51.980 --> 44:53.260
About the baby.

45:21.500 --> 45:25.740
Downtown by Petula Clark.

45:39.820 --> 45:41.940
There you are, sir.
Thank you, Armstrong.

45:54.340 --> 45:55.340
Baxter.

45:59.820 --> 46:02.059
Is it my father, sir?

46:02.060 --> 46:05.780
I'm afraid so. Last night
in his sleep. I'm so sorry.

46:05.820 --> 46:08.740
We'll get you on the next flight
back to RAF Lyneham.

46:11.980 --> 46:13.819
It's almost time.

46:13.820 --> 46:15.460
What?

46:15.500 --> 46:17.100
I have to get ready, sir.

46:18.340 --> 46:21.660
You know, Alec, you really don't
have... Yes, I do, sir.

46:45.700 --> 46:47.539
And don't forget, children,

46:47.540 --> 46:50.180
Father Christmas is going
to be here at 4 o'clock!

46:51.260 --> 46:53.739
Are you a good swimmer? Sorry? What?

46:53.740 --> 46:56.099
Are you a good swimmer?

46:56.100 --> 46:58.179
Er, yes.

46:58.180 --> 46:59.740
How about you?

46:59.780 --> 47:00.940
Very good.

47:09.100 --> 47:10.100
Yusra?

47:13.220 --> 47:14.539
Go away.

47:14.540 --> 47:16.180
Get away from me.

47:22.500 --> 47:23.900
I forgot my trunks.

47:25.940 --> 47:27.740
I can't swim without my trunks.

47:29.780 --> 47:32.420
I'm sorry. Next time, hey? Yeah.

47:34.260 --> 47:36.579
It's a promise.
Now, let's get you back.

47:36.580 --> 47:38.139
Hello, George.

47:38.140 --> 47:39.860
I'm afraid I've disappointed him.

47:41.100 --> 47:42.580
He wanted to swim to the raft.

47:42.620 --> 47:45.619
I can take you to the beach -

47:45.620 --> 47:49.859
paddling only, but better than
nothing. What do you think? Yes?

47:49.860 --> 47:51.340
OK. Here you are.

47:54.780 --> 47:55.980
Thank you.

48:23.820 --> 48:25.940
Crater. The Gordon Hotel.

48:28.740 --> 48:30.940
See you on the other side.

49:51.020 --> 49:52.779
Hello, little man!

49:52.780 --> 49:54.619
Do you all know who I am?

49:54.620 --> 49:57.060
Father Christmas!
Yes, I'm Father Christmas!

49:57.100 --> 49:58.500
Honor, where's George?

49:58.540 --> 50:01.539
They were going swimming
in the sea, Joe and George.

50:01.540 --> 50:03.140
George can't swim in the sea!

50:05.700 --> 50:07.099
George!

50:07.100 --> 50:08.820
George? George!

50:10.420 --> 50:12.100
George! George!

50:13.740 --> 50:16.060
I'm so sorry!

50:21.860 --> 50:23.899
They were going to swim to the raft!

50:23.900 --> 50:25.500
God! George!

50:25.540 --> 50:27.140
Help! There's a child missing!

50:28.900 --> 50:31.819
George! George!

50:31.820 --> 50:33.499
Joe!?

50:33.500 --> 50:35.620
My son's out there!

50:35.660 --> 50:37.219
George?!

50:37.220 --> 50:39.340
Joe said there were sharks. JOE!

50:43.780 --> 50:45.700
What did you do with the film?

50:45.740 --> 50:47.260
Destroyed it.

50:48.540 --> 50:50.099
Good.

50:50.100 --> 50:52.740
Good? It's a better story.

50:53.740 --> 50:55.420
I don't understand.

50:55.460 --> 50:59.019
The lengths the British Army
will go to cover up the truth.

50:59.020 --> 51:00.659
It's better, it's bigger.

51:00.660 --> 51:02.780
Listen, it's not that simple
and you know it isn't.

51:02.820 --> 51:06.140
Did you tell your wife where
you were going on Christmas day?

51:07.500 --> 51:08.660
Excuse me.

51:14.780 --> 51:16.100
I gotta go.

51:21.500 --> 51:22.980
His name is George.

51:23.020 --> 51:24.820
Most of you know him.

51:24.860 --> 51:29.099
He was wearing a red football shirt
with the number seven on the back.

51:29.100 --> 51:31.740
If we could look everywhere, please,
every room.

51:31.780 --> 51:35.060
He's probably just playing
somewhere, I'm sure.

51:35.100 --> 51:36.780
He was with Joe Martin.

51:36.820 --> 51:38.860
No, no. I saw Captain Martin leave.

51:38.900 --> 51:40.340
Was he...? On his own. He was...

51:40.380 --> 51:42.940
He was leaving on his own, sir.
So George...? He wasn't with him.

51:55.540 --> 51:59.580
Honor.

51:59.620 --> 52:01.379
It's all my fault.

52:01.380 --> 52:04.219
No, I... I...
I was supposed to look after him.

52:04.220 --> 52:05.860
Look, drink this down.

52:10.460 --> 52:11.460
And this.

52:13.180 --> 52:14.460
Good girl.

52:15.820 --> 52:17.660
What am I going to tell Mary?

52:17.700 --> 52:19.460
What about Mary?

52:19.500 --> 52:22.100
Joe! Thank God! Where's George?!

52:23.740 --> 52:25.339
I haven't seen him.

52:25.340 --> 52:27.620
Well, what... what do you mean?
Where were you?!

52:27.660 --> 52:30.820
You were supposed to be with him and
you were to bring him to the raft!

52:30.860 --> 52:34.100
I left him with Yusra.
Well, where's Yusra?

52:35.340 --> 52:36.859
Where's Yusra?!

52:36.860 --> 52:39.780
Harry... I have to tell her.
I have to tell Mary. Harry!

52:55.580 --> 52:57.100
Mary...?

52:57.140 --> 52:59.499
Mary, George is, um...

52:59.500 --> 53:02.659
George was, er...

53:02.660 --> 53:04.859
We don't know where he is.

53:04.860 --> 53:07.139
He was with Yusra and, er...

53:07.140 --> 53:08.620
We can't find him.

53:16.540 --> 53:18.380
If he's with Yusra, then he's safe.

53:18.420 --> 53:21.180
They'll have gone somewhere
together. Where does she live?

53:22.660 --> 53:25.259
Think, Mary. You must know.

53:25.260 --> 53:28.740
Crater, I think.
Where in Crater? Come on.

53:29.740 --> 53:31.660
Jesus Christ, Mary!
Why don't you know?!

53:31.700 --> 53:33.100
Crater isn't a bloody village!

53:39.940 --> 53:41.339
I'm sorry.

53:41.340 --> 53:42.540
Sorry.

53:42.580 --> 53:44.179
Right.

53:44.180 --> 53:45.980
Crater.

53:51.940 --> 53:55.139
Now, I'm sure this is all
some sort of misunderstanding.

53:55.140 --> 53:59.580
Um, we think he may have gone
off with the...

53:59.620 --> 54:01.420
the local woman who, um...

54:02.820 --> 54:04.260
Er, her name is Yusra.

54:05.500 --> 54:08.739
And we're not sure where
exactly she lives...

54:08.740 --> 54:11.539
It's somewhere in Crater.
And I'm asking for your help.

54:11.540 --> 54:13.140
The phone call was anonymous.

54:13.180 --> 54:14.700
The parcel was on my bed in my room.

54:16.060 --> 54:17.260
This was inside.

54:49.980 --> 54:52.019
They've taken him.

54:52.020 --> 54:53.660
The NLF.

54:55.900 --> 54:57.299
They've got George.

55:10.540 --> 55:13.139
It's all right, it's all right...

55:15.580 --> 55:17.019
Shh...

56:09.620 --> 56:12.180
Have you got your flight home,
Baxter? I'm not going, sir.

56:12.220 --> 56:14.259
Go home. That's an order.
Your father would...

56:14.260 --> 56:16.899
My father is dead, sir. There's
nothing I can do for him any more.

56:16.900 --> 56:19.739
Your son has his whole life ahead
of him and we're going to find him.

56:19.740 --> 56:21.579
Are you disobeying my order?
Yes, sir. I am.

56:21.580 --> 56:23.619
I'm leaving Orchover here
to look after you.

56:23.620 --> 56:25.299
And I'm going to lead
the search of Crater,

56:25.300 --> 56:26.900
with your permission to do so, sir?

56:32.380 --> 56:33.780
Permission granted.

57:09.140 --> 57:10.540
Sir, you don't have to...

57:10.580 --> 57:13.300
1930 hours. Sorry
I'm half an hour late, Corporal.

57:14.620 --> 57:16.900
Shoes, excellent.

57:18.060 --> 57:19.740
Sir. Sam Brown...

57:22.100 --> 57:23.620
Perfect. Sir.

57:31.060 --> 57:34.300
He wants to be a Royal Military
Policeman when he grows up.

57:35.740 --> 57:37.180
Then he will be, sir.

57:41.620 --> 57:44.660
These corners are the best
I've ever seen. Sir.

57:59.900 --> 58:02.339
It's the CO's boy!
We're going to bring him home.

58:02.340 --> 58:05.179
We thought you might like
half an hour on your own with him.

58:05.180 --> 58:07.019
What do you want? My country back.

58:07.020 --> 58:08.420
This is our son.

58:08.460 --> 58:10.939
You have to talk to me.
I let this happen.

58:10.940 --> 58:13.499
I'm just thinking about the life
experience of our new acting CO.

58:13.500 --> 58:15.340
Major Markham remains in command.

58:15.380 --> 58:17.019
He doesn't know I'm pregnant.

58:17.020 --> 58:19.100
I don't want a baby.
I thought he knew.

58:19.140 --> 58:20.620
Am I doing something wrong, Joe?

58:20.660 --> 58:24.380
I can't ask permission from my wife
for everything that I do.

58:27.380 --> 58:28.939
George!
