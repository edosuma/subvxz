WEBVTT

00:03.832 --> 00:05.432
You raped me, Eddie.

00:05.432 --> 00:06.672
Live with it.

00:07.672 --> 00:09.312
Aaarggh!

00:09.312 --> 00:11.352
Are you going to take care
of me, Dr Keogh?

00:11.352 --> 00:12.952
I can try.

00:12.952 --> 00:15.752
If I'm going to be in detox,
I need someone to feed my dog.

00:15.752 --> 00:17.752
She's still losing a lot of blood.

00:21.672 --> 00:24.952
Yeah, I know what you're gonna say.
12 hours? 12 hours!

00:24.952 --> 00:28.032
We are definitely going to be
investigated now.

00:28.032 --> 00:30.992
Dr Edward McAllister, I'm
arresting you on suspicion

00:30.992 --> 00:33.072
of the rape of Dr Alicia Munroe...
Arresting me?

00:33.072 --> 00:34.352
..on the night of May 26th 2018.

01:07.792 --> 01:09.312
ANGRY SHOUTING

01:53.152 --> 01:58.192
Alicia. Alicia! We weren't
expecting you back so soon.

01:58.392 --> 01:59.472
Yeah. Do you know what,

01:59.472 --> 02:01.872
I'd rather be here than be home
alone, to be honest.

02:01.872 --> 02:03.672
Of course, don't get me wrong,

02:03.672 --> 02:05.712
we need all the help we can get.

02:07.112 --> 02:08.472
How is everyone?

02:08.472 --> 02:11.392
You heard about Iain?
Yeah, suspended, I heard.

02:11.392 --> 02:14.232
We're just doing the usual. Keeping
calm, carrying on nursing.

02:16.032 --> 02:17.072
Hi. Hi

02:18.912 --> 02:20.592
Hey, it's good to see you.

02:20.592 --> 02:21.832
Hey.

02:22.872 --> 02:24.192
What are you doing at work?

02:25.192 --> 02:27.232
Last I checked,
I still had a job here.

02:27.232 --> 02:29.032
Unless you know something I don't.

02:29.032 --> 02:33.232
No, of course... You know you
don't have to yet?

02:34.712 --> 02:36.112
I know, but I'm fine, so...

02:37.792 --> 02:42.552
OK, well, take it easy today, yeah?
Stick on minors.

02:42.552 --> 02:45.312
No, look, I want to stay busy,
right?

02:45.312 --> 02:48.392
Whatever comes in, no exceptions
and no special treatment, please.

02:49.632 --> 02:50.992
All right.

02:55.112 --> 02:57.512
DOORBELL RINGS

02:57.512 --> 02:59.192
OK, then, sit.

03:01.552 --> 03:03.792
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realise.

03:03.792 --> 03:05.632
Doing house calls now, Doctor?

03:05.632 --> 03:08.272
Yeah, something like that.

03:08.272 --> 03:10.152
They said you'd coming
back last night,

03:10.152 --> 03:12.432
so I thought you'd probably
want your dog back.

03:12.432 --> 03:13.792
Thank you.

03:15.672 --> 03:18.632
Come in for some coffee?
The neighbours will start talking.

03:18.632 --> 03:22.112
No, I can't... Don't worry,
I'm not going to put whiskey in it.

03:22.112 --> 03:24.752
Good, good. How did it go?
Yeah, it was good.

03:24.752 --> 03:27.952
Well, maybe tonight, we can take
the dogs for a walk?

03:27.952 --> 03:30.632
She's probably had enough of me.

03:30.632 --> 03:32.712
Well, if you change your mind,
give us a call.

03:34.032 --> 03:36.072
Go to go, ta-ra!

03:39.712 --> 03:42.392
Come on, boys, you know
the plan for today.

03:42.392 --> 03:46.392
We've got to be out of here in
30 minutes. Come on, move it.

03:46.392 --> 03:47.472
Girls?

03:51.912 --> 03:56.232
There you are.
You didn't eat anything, did you?

03:56.232 --> 03:57.992
No. I remembered in time.

03:57.992 --> 04:01.072
Good girl.
You're all ready, then, huh?

04:01.072 --> 04:03.912
Might as well get it over with.
Did Daddy call yet?

04:03.912 --> 04:07.392
No. His plane doesn't land for
another half hour.

04:07.392 --> 04:09.712
I'm sure he'll call straight away.

04:09.712 --> 04:12.472
Boys! Up! Now!

04:12.472 --> 04:15.512
So remember to lock the back door
when you go out... Yes, Mum.

04:15.512 --> 04:17.512
And you know where the emergency
numbers are?

04:17.512 --> 04:19.032
Yeah, in the kitchen.

04:19.032 --> 04:22.112
Don't forget to hang the laundry
out when you get home. I won't.

04:24.272 --> 04:26.232
Have a wonderful trip.

04:26.232 --> 04:27.552
The hotel looks great.

04:27.552 --> 04:30.032
Your father getting romantic
in his old age. Imagine.

04:30.032 --> 04:32.752
We're only a couple of hours away if
there's any problems.

04:32.752 --> 04:35.632
You're sure you don't mind going
home to an empty house tonight?

04:35.632 --> 04:37.232
Mum, I'll be fine.

04:37.232 --> 04:39.712
See you in a couple of days.

04:39.712 --> 04:40.832
OK.

04:40.832 --> 04:42.112
Enjoy!

04:52.672 --> 04:55.512
Not just me who's late, then,
thank goodness.

04:55.512 --> 04:57.352
We're not late, we're right on time.

04:57.352 --> 04:59.592
In Mrs Beauchamp's book,
that is late.

04:59.592 --> 05:01.192
My mum's a slow driver.

05:01.192 --> 05:02.632
Lucky you. I had to get the bus.

05:02.632 --> 05:04.472
My car's been repossessed for

05:04.472 --> 05:06.672
non-payment of
hospital parking fines.

05:06.672 --> 05:07.712
You're kidding!

05:07.712 --> 05:09.072
Do you see me smiling?

05:10.952 --> 05:12.552
It affects the whole department,

05:12.552 --> 05:15.072
so we need to look at the
recruitment and retention strategy

05:15.072 --> 05:16.232
for the nursing staff,

05:16.232 --> 05:17.952
because if the inspectors turn up
now...

05:17.952 --> 05:20.232
Right, sorry can I have
everyone's attention, please?

05:21.672 --> 05:22.952
Good of you to join us.

05:24.352 --> 05:27.432
As you know, we're anticipating a
CQC inspection,

05:27.432 --> 05:29.752
which could happen at any moment.

05:29.752 --> 05:32.672
With that in mind, I will e-mail
you individually with extra tasks

05:32.672 --> 05:34.832
to undertake pre-inspection.

05:34.832 --> 05:36.952
More responsibility?
Connie, we're at full capacity.

05:36.952 --> 05:38.872
There's no way we can take on
anything else.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.912
Fine. I know it's not
ideal. Look, it's not possible.

05:40.912 --> 05:42.472
It's not up for discussion.

05:45.032 --> 05:48.112
Blame Dr Keogh for
his 12-hour breach last week.

05:48.112 --> 05:51.432
Right, Dr Munroe will take
Shift Medical Lead today

05:51.432 --> 05:53.992
and Dr Hardy will supervise. Yeah.

05:53.992 --> 05:56.672
Do you really think
today's the best day?

05:56.672 --> 06:01.512
Alicia, you need to work on your
management portfolio, don't you?

06:01.512 --> 06:03.512
Yes. OK, X-rays to review.

06:03.512 --> 06:06.352
Only call back those
with life or limb problems.

06:06.352 --> 06:08.872
All right, any questions,
come and see me or Charlie.

06:08.872 --> 06:09.952
Welcome back.

06:11.392 --> 06:12.712
Thank you.

06:14.152 --> 06:15.752
Let me know if I can do anything.

06:15.752 --> 06:17.552
Ethan, I'm fine.

06:18.992 --> 06:20.152
OK.

06:24.512 --> 06:26.512
He's only trying to help.

06:26.512 --> 06:28.472
Yes, well it's having the
opposite effect.

06:32.232 --> 06:34.912
Eddie has his plea hearing today
for the ABH charge,

06:34.912 --> 06:38.272
and my contact officer isn't sure
he's going to plead guilty.

06:39.792 --> 06:41.432
I'm still waiting to hear, so...

06:43.792 --> 06:46.832
Can you just check my bag? I did
pack your hospital notes, didn't I?

06:46.832 --> 06:48.632
I forgot my drawing book and
crayons.

06:48.632 --> 06:52.352
Oh, Tyler! We can't go back now!
Is that your notes?

06:52.352 --> 06:53.552
Yes.

06:53.552 --> 06:56.152
Oh, thank goodness. I'm sure Gina
will have some crayons for you.

06:56.152 --> 06:59.312
Now listen, I need you to behave
while you're at Gina's,

06:59.312 --> 07:01.112
while I take Luna to hospital.

07:01.112 --> 07:03.232
Daniel, you got my messages?

07:03.232 --> 07:04.312
Is everything all right?

07:04.312 --> 07:05.832
It's fine. ALL: Hi, Dad!

07:05.832 --> 07:07.592
Shush, kids, I need to talk to
Daddy.

07:07.592 --> 07:09.432
I'm dropping the others at Gina's,

07:09.432 --> 07:11.632
then we're going straight
to the hospital.

07:11.632 --> 07:14.232
She's going to have them for a
sleepover tonight.

07:14.232 --> 07:15.352
I forgot my pyjamas!

07:16.912 --> 07:18.872
If they'd just called me
half an hour earlier

07:18.872 --> 07:21.272
I'd have been able to catch you
before you got on the plane.

07:21.272 --> 07:22.992
I've already re-booked.
There's a flight

07:22.992 --> 07:24.392
that will get me back to Heathrow

07:24.392 --> 07:26.232
in about eight hours.
We're about to board.

07:26.232 --> 07:28.632
I'll be at the hospital this
evening. That's really great.

07:28.632 --> 07:30.312
Are you sure? You'll be exhausted.

07:30.312 --> 07:33.232
My daughter going in for a kidney
transplant? Of course I'm sure.

07:33.232 --> 07:35.392
Let me talk to her.
Hi, Dad.

07:35.392 --> 07:38.632
Hey, Tink. So, this is exciting.

07:38.632 --> 07:40.672
I guess. You know what this means,
don't you?

07:40.672 --> 07:42.592
You'll be all better in a couple of
months,

07:42.592 --> 07:44.952
and then we can finally make
that trip to Disneyland.

07:44.952 --> 07:46.912
ALL: Disneyland! Yes!

07:46.912 --> 07:49.792
I can't see Daddy. Which
Disneyland will we go to?

07:49.792 --> 07:52.152
Oh, Josh! I'll get it.

07:52.152 --> 07:54.552
Luna,
keep your seatbelt fastened.

07:54.552 --> 07:57.352
I can see it! Don't let it go under
the pedals! Hello?

07:57.352 --> 07:58.952
CAR HORN

07:58.952 --> 08:00.152
THEY SCREAM

08:06.672 --> 08:08.552
Hello, Dr Masum.

08:08.552 --> 08:10.472
Hello, Ancillary Staff Member Dean.

08:11.832 --> 08:13.792
How's Iain? Have you spoken to him?

08:13.792 --> 08:18.032
No. Well, yeah. But he's not doing
much talking.

08:18.032 --> 08:20.672
Keeps coming up with
excuses to stay home.

08:20.672 --> 08:22.712
I'm really worried.

08:22.712 --> 08:25.552
Iain's that kind of guy.
He's gone into his cave.

08:25.552 --> 08:26.992
He'll come out when he's ready.

08:26.992 --> 08:30.392
You think?
He isn't as tough as he makes out.

08:31.352 --> 08:32.952
Nobody ever is.

08:32.952 --> 08:35.512
It doesn't mean he's not as
tough as he needs to be.

08:35.512 --> 08:39.512
Look, what are you
doing tonight?

08:39.512 --> 08:42.032
Nothing special.
Do you want to go to the pub?

08:42.032 --> 08:44.272
Why don't you come over to my
place and I'll cook?

08:45.392 --> 08:48.032
You'll cook for me? Yeah.

08:48.032 --> 08:49.552
Well, don't get your hopes
up too high.

08:49.552 --> 08:51.152
But if I do give you food poisoning,

08:51.152 --> 08:53.352
at least you know you'll be in
safe hands. I'd love to.

08:55.992 --> 08:58.712
Any allergies? I have to ask as a
medical professional.

08:58.712 --> 09:00.912
Things you don't eat?

09:00.912 --> 09:03.112
Liver. Broccoli. Cream and
mushrooms,

09:03.112 --> 09:06.592
but only if they're together, if
they're separate, it's fine.

09:06.592 --> 09:08.512
Avocado - ugh.

09:08.512 --> 09:10.832
And nothing fishy.

09:10.832 --> 09:13.912
OK, well, luckily, I wouldn't know
what to do with any of those things.

09:13.912 --> 09:15.912
I'm excited. You can tell a lot
about somebody

09:15.912 --> 09:17.392
by the way they live, can't you?

09:17.392 --> 09:20.992
Yeah, my place, it's just normal.

09:20.992 --> 09:22.832
Can't wait.

09:33.112 --> 09:35.392
I'll be with you in one second, OK?

09:36.632 --> 09:38.072
Oi!

09:39.672 --> 09:41.752
Was that directed at me?

09:41.752 --> 09:44.992
Now that you've contributed to
bringing a CQC down on our heads,

09:44.992 --> 09:46.952
the least you can do is put some
effort in

09:46.952 --> 09:48.592
and help the ED shape up today.

09:48.592 --> 09:51.872
You are in everyone's bad books,
Dylan. Including mine.

09:51.872 --> 09:54.312
All right. There's something
oddly reassuring about that,

09:54.312 --> 09:55.352
being in your bad books.

09:55.352 --> 09:56.992
Some things never change.

09:56.992 --> 09:58.872
Some things do.

09:58.872 --> 10:01.192
What is it?

10:01.192 --> 10:03.472
This was in my cubbyhole this
morning.

10:03.472 --> 10:05.312
it's from Human Resources...

10:05.312 --> 10:07.512
..asking me to clear out
Sam's locker

10:07.512 --> 10:09.352
by the end of the day, no less.

10:10.752 --> 10:11.992
Dylan, I'm sorry.

10:11.992 --> 10:15.192
They me down as her next of kin
for some reason. Bit odd, isn't it?

10:16.192 --> 10:17.472
I can help you.

10:17.472 --> 10:19.912
No, no, that's fine, thank you.
Thanks, I'll manage.

10:21.552 --> 10:22.792
Off to work now.

10:27.432 --> 10:30.032
Here's your lottery ticket,
Mary.

10:30.032 --> 10:34.032
Remember, it's me you've promised
to elope with when you win.

10:34.032 --> 10:37.552
Yes. Thank you. You've dropped a bit
of jigsaw, Harry,

10:37.552 --> 10:38.832
a corner piece, too.

10:40.072 --> 10:44.712
Let's see "Design that
takes some beating".

10:44.712 --> 10:45.992
Six letters.

10:45.992 --> 10:50.152
T, something, something,
T, something, O.

10:50.152 --> 10:51.432
Tattoo!

10:53.832 --> 10:55.272
OK, you ready?

10:56.232 --> 10:58.312
Are you sure about this?

10:58.312 --> 11:01.352
Don't you bottle out on me now,
come on. Let's go.

11:01.352 --> 11:03.832
On your own head be it, Joe.

11:03.832 --> 11:05.232
Come on!

11:17.752 --> 11:19.472
OK, what was the code?

11:20.432 --> 11:21.552
I forgot.

11:21.552 --> 11:22.992
But you said you knew it!

11:22.992 --> 11:28.032
I did, it was a date,
something...four digits.

11:28.352 --> 11:29.632
A date of what?

11:29.632 --> 11:31.232
The year the film opened.

11:31.232 --> 11:34.192
I remember because I took my wife to
see it on our first date.

11:34.192 --> 11:36.992
What film? I don't remember.

11:36.992 --> 11:39.952
What year?
When did you meet your wife?

11:39.952 --> 11:41.152
New Year's Day!

11:41.152 --> 11:43.592
New Year's Day, when?

11:43.592 --> 11:45.072
When I met my wife.

11:45.072 --> 11:49.352
Look, Joe, you've got to remember,
or you're not escaping from here.

11:49.352 --> 11:51.872
That was it. The escape film.

11:51.872 --> 11:54.872
The Great Escape!
What year was that?

11:54.872 --> 11:56.912
1960-something.

11:56.912 --> 11:58.192
One?

11:58.192 --> 11:59.592
Maybe.

11:59.592 --> 12:01.112
Steve McQueen.

12:01.112 --> 12:04.872
Now, was it before or after
The Magnificent Seven?

12:04.872 --> 12:06.152
DOOR BUZZER

12:08.752 --> 12:11.432
You might as well come with me now.

12:13.712 --> 12:16.232
OK, so we're getting close to
breach in cubicle four,

12:16.232 --> 12:18.632
but two and five should be clear in
about 30 minutes.

12:18.632 --> 12:21.792
We'll be fine on four if we can get
a bed in Orthopaedics.

12:21.792 --> 12:23.592
We can't breach again, Charlie.

12:23.592 --> 12:25.872
Not when Mrs Beauchamp's got me
as Medical Lead

12:25.872 --> 12:27.312
and is breathing down my neck.

12:27.312 --> 12:28.712
I'm working on it.

12:28.712 --> 12:29.712
Thanks.

12:29.712 --> 12:31.152
Hey.

12:31.152 --> 12:33.752
We've got five RTC
patients just arrived.

12:33.752 --> 12:34.792
Five!

12:34.792 --> 12:37.912
Yeah, it's not as bad as it sounds,
three were cleared at the scene.

12:37.912 --> 12:40.832
I'm happy to direct traffic. No. Mrs
Beauchamp put me on point.

12:40.832 --> 12:42.112
I can do this.

12:42.112 --> 12:43.752
Yeah, OK.

12:43.752 --> 12:46.352
It's a family, mother, four minors,

12:46.352 --> 12:48.992
and the eldest daughter, who's
11, and the mother

12:48.992 --> 12:51.432
are the ones
we need to be concerned about.

12:51.432 --> 12:54.112
OK. Mother to Resus,
you take her.

12:54.112 --> 12:56.752
I'll take the 11-year old.
OK. Good plan.

12:56.752 --> 12:59.592
Thanks. Rash, can you take the other
three kids to paediatrics?

12:59.592 --> 13:02.232
Make sure they have regular obs,
just to be on the safe side.

13:06.712 --> 13:08.272
This is the mother, yeah?

13:08.272 --> 13:11.512
Yes, Theresa Jordons, 46 years old,

13:11.512 --> 13:15.632
driver in an RTC approximately
half hour ago.

13:15.632 --> 13:18.232
GCS 15, all her signs are normal,

13:18.232 --> 13:23.232
no allergies, though she has
been complaining of chest pains

13:23.672 --> 13:26.712
and possible sternum fracture.

13:26.712 --> 13:28.072
SHE GROANS
OK.

13:28.072 --> 13:29.832
Let's get her on her side, please.

13:29.832 --> 13:32.672
On three. One, two, three.

13:40.192 --> 13:41.992
That's better.

13:41.992 --> 13:43.192
My children...

13:43.192 --> 13:45.272
Where's my mum?
Will she be all right?

13:47.112 --> 13:51.032
We will find out as soon as
I've had a good look at you, OK?

13:51.032 --> 13:54.232
She is right next door,
so try not to worry.

13:54.232 --> 13:56.872
Where's my sister and brothers?

13:56.872 --> 14:00.552
Another doctor is looking after
them, actually,

14:00.552 --> 14:04.192
but I heard the paramedics say that
they were in good shape.

14:05.992 --> 14:08.032
Do you have any pain in your neck?

14:08.032 --> 14:09.232
No.

14:09.232 --> 14:10.752
Just my head, where I banged it.

14:10.752 --> 14:12.512
Any other pains? No.

14:14.152 --> 14:15.352
All right.

14:16.792 --> 14:18.792
Yeah, that's a large haematoma.

14:18.792 --> 14:23.872
We can't rule out a fracture,
so let's get a CT-head,

14:24.312 --> 14:25.992
but the neck seems fine.,

14:25.992 --> 14:28.112
Will I still have my
operation today?

14:28.112 --> 14:29.752
What operation?

14:29.752 --> 14:31.912
We're going to be in so much
trouble.

14:31.912 --> 14:34.992
They won't even notice we're
missing until bedtime.

14:34.992 --> 14:36.952
Let's make a day of it.

14:36.952 --> 14:39.112
Getting you back up the
hill won't be easy.

14:39.112 --> 14:41.152
You'll manage. Onward!

14:41.152 --> 14:43.352
I got it! I got it!
I got it! I got it!

14:43.352 --> 14:44.392
No, no, no.

14:44.392 --> 14:46.632
I don't got it! I don't got it!

14:46.632 --> 14:48.672
Aaaghhh!

14:52.472 --> 14:54.552
Aaagghh!

14:56.352 --> 14:58.512
Joseph, are you all right?

14:58.512 --> 15:00.952
HE LAUGHS

15:02.272 --> 15:05.312
Oh. Oh. Oh.

15:05.312 --> 15:06.992
Ohh.

15:06.992 --> 15:09.992
We made it! I want the full English.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.592
Right come on.

15:11.592 --> 15:14.472
Let's go in! Reg, what's wrong?

15:14.472 --> 15:18.472
I don't feel so good, Joe.
Reg? I've got to use the toilet.

15:18.472 --> 15:20.632
Reggie, what's wrong? Reggie!

15:22.112 --> 15:23.712
Luna has end stage renal failure,

15:23.712 --> 15:25.632
and they just got the
call last night.

15:25.632 --> 15:28.712
They found a donor kidney and
she's top of the list on standby

15:28.712 --> 15:30.272
for an operation today.

15:30.272 --> 15:32.392
We need her cleared of injury
as soon as possible

15:32.392 --> 15:35.392
because if the kidney arrives, she
could be suitable for theatre.

15:35.392 --> 15:36.952
If her scan comes back clear.

15:36.952 --> 15:38.432
Right.

15:38.432 --> 15:41.272
Call in favours. I need her scanned
ASAP. I'll give renal a heads-up.

15:41.272 --> 15:42.912
Well, they all look healthy enough.

15:44.112 --> 15:45.312
Rash.

15:46.352 --> 15:48.192
Finally, you're here!

15:48.192 --> 15:49.352
Everything OK?

15:49.352 --> 15:52.432
Yeah, the kids are fine.
Minor bruising and abrasions.

15:52.432 --> 15:55.152
I'm trying to dress their wounds,
if I can catch them.

15:55.152 --> 15:57.112
Where's the mum?
Having a CT and X-ray.

15:58.192 --> 16:00.752
The dad? Mid-Atlantic, apparently.

16:00.752 --> 16:03.232
Right, OK, well,
I can't babysit them.

16:03.232 --> 16:05.392
Where's Princess Luna?

16:05.392 --> 16:07.072
She is having a CT scan.

16:07.072 --> 16:08.312
What's that?

16:08.312 --> 16:11.512
It's like a special X-ray that
lets us look inside her head.

16:11.512 --> 16:13.552
You'll not find anything in there.

16:13.552 --> 16:16.432
You call her Princess Luna?
That's nice.

16:16.432 --> 16:18.472
Only because Mum and Dad
treat her like one.

16:18.472 --> 16:20.072
She's their favourite.

16:20.072 --> 16:21.952
Come on, I'm sure that's not true.

16:21.952 --> 16:24.632
Right, Dr Masum here is going
to put plasters on you

16:24.632 --> 16:26.392
and make you all feel better, OK,

16:26.392 --> 16:28.552
but you've got to stay really
still and really quiet.

16:28.552 --> 16:32.192
Then I will take you to see
your mum and sister. OK.

16:32.192 --> 16:35.552
I'll come back and check on them
once you've got them sorted.

16:35.552 --> 16:37.032
OK, come on.

16:37.032 --> 16:38.352
OK. Yes, I'll hold.

16:40.192 --> 16:42.632
Those kids exhaust me
just looking at them.

16:42.632 --> 16:44.232
You think that's bad?

16:44.232 --> 16:47.072
It's my granddaughter's
birthday party later. Two years old.

16:47.072 --> 16:49.112
Charlie's been trying to duck
out of it all week.

16:49.112 --> 16:50.952
I've always said Charlie
was a wise man.

16:52.032 --> 16:54.072
CT? Yes, hello! Goodness me.

16:54.072 --> 16:57.792
They aren't hanging around today,
are they, the paramedics?

16:57.792 --> 17:00.912
They're short-staffed, with Iain
being suspended and Sam...

17:00.912 --> 17:03.112
Yeah, yeah, yeah. ..gone.
Yeah, deceased.

17:03.112 --> 17:04.592
That's the medical term.

17:04.592 --> 17:07.512
I've got a letter from HR to confirm
it, deceased.

17:07.512 --> 17:09.552
OK, what have we got here?

17:09.552 --> 17:12.432
This is Reggie Brannigan,
he is 84 years old,

17:12.432 --> 17:15.752
he was seen to become confused about
25 minutes ago.

17:15.752 --> 17:18.752
He fell, injuring his right hand on
some broken crockery.

17:18.752 --> 17:21.592
Right, OK.
He's had one gram IV paracetamol.

17:21.592 --> 17:26.672
GCS 15, heart rate 96,
BP 130/85 and SATS 97%.

17:28.792 --> 17:30.672
Not sure about any
history of dementia.

17:30.672 --> 17:34.032
Joe? Joe! The Nazis will be coming
after us on the motorbikes!

17:34.032 --> 17:36.032
We need to get back!

17:36.032 --> 17:39.112
Reggie, you're safe here, you just
took a bit of a tumble, that's all.

17:39.112 --> 17:40.912
This is Reggie's friend, Joseph.

17:40.912 --> 17:42.712
He's always a worrier,
he'll be fine.

17:42.712 --> 17:45.192
OK, Reggie, my name's Dr Keogh.

17:45.192 --> 17:47.392
I'm going to just have a quick
look at your hand.

17:47.392 --> 17:49.472
Doctor? Yeah.
Did Ms Carter send you?

17:51.472 --> 17:53.032
What are you going to do to me?

17:53.032 --> 17:54.992
Sorry, who's Ms Carter?

17:54.992 --> 17:56.312
Oh, he means Nurse Ratched.

17:56.312 --> 17:57.472
She runs the care home.

17:57.472 --> 17:59.392
Oh, you live in a care home?

17:59.392 --> 18:01.752
You live in a care home. OK. Does he
often get confused?

18:01.752 --> 18:02.872
No.

18:02.872 --> 18:06.712
Well, yes, a bit. We're in our
eighties. It's nothing serious.

18:06.712 --> 18:10.872
OK, well, let's have a look at this
hand, then, OK?

18:10.872 --> 18:11.952
Hey.

18:11.952 --> 18:14.592
It's OK, it's all right, all right,
I'm here to help.

18:14.592 --> 18:16.232
Which care home?

18:16.232 --> 18:18.872
Oh, don't worry about that.
They won't even know we're not there

18:18.872 --> 18:20.832
OK.

18:20.832 --> 18:22.152
Aaaaai!

18:23.592 --> 18:26.592
Do you know where you are, do you?
Do you know where you are?

18:26.592 --> 18:30.272
Reggie, it's OK, these
are our friends.

18:30.272 --> 18:34.072
Remember me? Joseph? We did a runner
this morning.

18:34.072 --> 18:36.352
We're having a boys' day out.

18:36.352 --> 18:37.632
Six across.

18:37.632 --> 18:39.232
Tattoo.

18:40.632 --> 18:42.472
Am I OK? Can I see Mum?

18:43.392 --> 18:46.272
She is still in X-ray.

18:46.272 --> 18:47.552
I want my daddy.

18:48.672 --> 18:50.392
Aw, look, he's on an aeroplane now.

18:50.392 --> 18:52.592
He'll be back here as soon
as he can.

18:52.592 --> 18:55.352
It's better when Daddy's here.
He doesn't worry as much as Mum.

18:56.472 --> 18:57.832
Did you get my CT scan results yet?

18:58.792 --> 18:59.992
I'm used to being a patient.

18:59.992 --> 19:02.432
Just haven't been in this bit of
the hospital before.

19:02.432 --> 19:05.072
Yeah, I think we should wait
till your mam gets back.

19:06.432 --> 19:10.912
Look, I'm used to being poked and
prodded and scanned and X-rayed.

19:10.912 --> 19:13.272
I've spent most of my life
in and out of here and St James'

19:13.272 --> 19:16.432
and I've probably met as many
doctors as you have.

19:16.432 --> 19:18.632
I'm the patient, I have a
right to know.

19:20.312 --> 19:21.672
She's right.

19:23.072 --> 19:26.192
Um... OK, well, there was

19:26.192 --> 19:31.152
a small area of attenuation
on your scan.

19:32.392 --> 19:34.072
That's like a bright, white area

19:34.072 --> 19:36.192
that we're slightly concerned about.
I know.

19:37.312 --> 19:38.312
Right.

19:39.512 --> 19:43.592
Well, the radiologist thinks it
could be a bleed in your head from

19:43.592 --> 19:45.112
where you banged it in the accident,

19:45.112 --> 19:47.512
which would mean we would have to
postpone your operation.

19:48.872 --> 19:50.192
What do you think?

19:51.512 --> 19:52.752
Um...

19:53.712 --> 19:57.792
I think that you don't have any
symptoms and you look too well.

19:57.792 --> 20:00.912
I'm on dialysis and if I was any
paler, I'd be see-through.

20:02.472 --> 20:04.952
It's a long time since anyone's
told me I looked well.

20:04.952 --> 20:08.192
I don't want my operation,
but I think I need it.

20:08.192 --> 20:09.792
Don't I?

20:10.912 --> 20:13.952
You look well enough that I would
like to investigate further.

20:13.952 --> 20:16.712
So let's not give up on that
operation just yet, OK?

20:16.712 --> 20:19.872
Where are my brothers and sister?
Are they OK? Can I see them?

20:19.872 --> 20:22.792
They're fine, yeah.
I'll bring them in for a visit now.

20:29.312 --> 20:31.272
That's a very grown-up young lady.

20:31.272 --> 20:33.952
Yeah, I think she's terrified,
but she hides it well.

20:33.952 --> 20:35.992
I would like her to get in for an
MRI scan,

20:35.992 --> 20:37.992
just to eliminate
any bleed on the brain.

20:37.992 --> 20:40.272
If we don't clear her in time for
that transplant,

20:40.272 --> 20:41.992
they'll give the kidney to someone
else.

20:41.992 --> 20:43.512
She might not get another chance.

20:43.512 --> 20:46.072
An MRI without a specialist
referral? You'll be lucky.

20:47.992 --> 20:51.312
Come on. You can't just go roaming
off because you're bored, OK?

20:53.632 --> 20:58.632
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey
enough! What is going on?

21:01.792 --> 21:03.632
when we ran out of cartoon character
ones,

21:03.632 --> 21:05.312
so I went to the pharmacy to get
more.

21:05.312 --> 21:07.512
Then I found those two roaming
around reception.

21:07.512 --> 21:09.952
Right, can we get a porter in here
to clean this up, please?

21:09.952 --> 21:12.992
Then you can take Scooby, Shaggy and
Scrappy to their sister in Resus.

21:12.992 --> 21:16.592
Stay with them. The sister's your
patient. And they're yours.

21:16.592 --> 21:19.752
Until the mam's back from X-ray,
they're your responsibility, OK?

21:19.752 --> 21:21.272
I've got a call to make.

21:22.752 --> 21:25.472
OK, guys, guys...

21:25.472 --> 21:28.352
Are you actually a grown-up?

21:28.352 --> 21:30.192
Yes. You don't look like a grown-up.

21:32.672 --> 21:36.352
Ah, Dr Keogh, I've got
Reggie's X-ray. Good.

21:36.352 --> 21:39.552
He's settled down now and I
checked his records,

21:39.552 --> 21:42.152
he's registered with
Lammock Health Residential Home.

21:42.152 --> 21:44.472
Right OK.
Thank you.

21:44.472 --> 21:46.592
Sorry for what I said
earlier about Sam.

21:48.592 --> 21:51.112
Oh, there's no need to apologise.

21:51.112 --> 21:53.792
She's not coming back, is she?

21:53.792 --> 21:56.152
Beyond even my powers
to raise the dead.

21:56.152 --> 21:57.232
Right.

22:04.152 --> 22:05.792
Gin!

22:05.792 --> 22:10.112
Again? Are you sure
you haven't marked this deck?

22:10.112 --> 22:11.512
Just because you're in hospital,

22:11.512 --> 22:13.192
doesn't mean I'm going to let you
win.

22:13.192 --> 22:14.712
Not when there's money at stake.

22:14.712 --> 22:18.192
Big boys' rules - you owe me 50p.

22:18.192 --> 22:19.952
Owe is the word.

22:19.952 --> 22:22.272
My wallet's wherever my
trousers have gone.

22:22.272 --> 22:25.712
It's never a good sign when a man's
lost his trousers.

22:26.872 --> 22:31.992
Reggie, good news, the X-ray came
back clear, so there's no fracture.

22:33.392 --> 22:36.032
We're going to remove all of
the glass from the wound,

22:36.032 --> 22:38.432
and as long as there's no tendon
damage when we stitch it up,

22:38.432 --> 22:39.912
you should get back full movement.

22:39.912 --> 22:41.152
OK?

22:41.152 --> 22:44.992
I just called your nursing home
and spoke to a Ms Carter.

22:44.992 --> 22:46.192
Nurse Ratched.

22:46.192 --> 22:49.392
Yes, we medical professionals love
that reference, it's very funny.

22:49.392 --> 22:51.472
She's all right, Ms Carter.

22:51.472 --> 22:53.512
Well, she was very relieved
to hear from me.

22:53.512 --> 22:55.792
Apparently, you're both
absent without leave.

22:55.792 --> 22:57.352
It's not a prison, you know.

22:57.352 --> 22:59.152
Just feels like it.

22:59.152 --> 23:03.712
OK, Reggie, I'm just going to have
a quick scan of your bladder

23:03.712 --> 23:07.992
to make sure you haven't retained
any urine in there, OK?

23:09.632 --> 23:10.992
Nothing wrong with a bit of fun.

23:10.992 --> 23:12.912
What, going walkabout and
not telling anyone?

23:12.912 --> 23:15.032
Breakfast at eight, gruel.

23:15.032 --> 23:16.672
Watch TV.

23:16.672 --> 23:18.152
Lunch at one, more gruel.

23:18.152 --> 23:19.592
Watch TV.

23:19.592 --> 23:21.592
Dinner at five, gruel and jelly.

23:21.592 --> 23:22.872
Watch TV.

23:22.872 --> 23:24.792
I used to be in the RAF.

23:24.792 --> 23:26.232
I flew Harrier jets.

23:28.112 --> 23:32.312
Reg was a civil engineer,
he built dams all over the world.

23:32.312 --> 23:35.152
Men like us don't do well
in nursing homes.

23:35.152 --> 23:37.552
There's nothing wrong with
a quieter life.

23:37.552 --> 23:39.312
Boring life, you mean.

23:40.312 --> 23:42.392
Who wants to sit at home
alone all the time?

23:42.392 --> 23:45.032
Me, please. You're criticising
my favourite hobby there.

23:46.232 --> 23:48.952
Hm. What does "Hm" mean?

23:48.952 --> 23:52.352
I'd like to take a closer look at
this. Can we get an opinion

23:52.352 --> 23:53.472
from urology when we can?

23:53.472 --> 23:55.672
Let's do CT abdomen and pelvis.

23:55.672 --> 23:58.352
Full bloods with a PSA, please.

23:58.352 --> 24:00.752
What is it? What's wrong?

24:03.072 --> 24:04.992
There's an abnormality there.

24:04.992 --> 24:08.432
I'd like to investigate further, OK?

24:08.432 --> 24:09.872
I'll get you some tissue.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.752
Hi.

24:14.752 --> 24:17.312
OK, Theresa,
your head CT was clear, all right,

24:17.312 --> 24:20.872
but you do have a fracture of the
sternum. It's just here.

24:20.872 --> 24:23.912
Now, we'll make you comfortable
till we can move you to a ward,

24:23.912 --> 24:26.112
but I'm afraid you will need to
be here overnight.

24:26.112 --> 24:27.952
We'd like to keep a close
eye on you,

24:27.952 --> 24:29.392
make sure it doesn't get any worse.

24:29.392 --> 24:30.832
But my kids...

24:33.832 --> 24:37.712
We have tracked down your husband's
flight and it's on time,

24:37.712 --> 24:39.312
so he should be here in a few hours.

24:39.312 --> 24:42.792
And Luna? Do we need to postpone
her operation now?

24:42.792 --> 24:45.792
I need to speak to Dr Munroe
about that, all right?

24:45.792 --> 24:47.672
I'll go see if I can find her, OK?

24:49.512 --> 24:51.512
Look, she's 11 years old.

24:52.552 --> 24:55.192
I know that the neurosurgeon hasn't
asked for it specifically,

24:55.192 --> 24:57.592
but if she's got a bleed in her
brain I need to know about it now,

24:57.592 --> 24:59.872
and if she hasn't got a bleed on the
brain,

24:59.872 --> 25:01.672
I also need to know about it now.

25:01.672 --> 25:04.312
The anaesthetists won't
touch her unless I clear her

25:04.312 --> 25:06.112
and she needs this kidney
transplant.

25:09.832 --> 25:12.312
Thank you, I'll send her up.

25:12.312 --> 25:14.272
Well done, you.

25:14.272 --> 25:17.712
Hey, Luna's mother is just asking
about the status of her operation.

25:17.712 --> 25:20.352
Yes, I'm just getting her cleared
of injury in time.

25:20.352 --> 25:25.232
OK, great. When you know, are you OK
to update her with the details?
MOBILE VIBRATES

25:25.232 --> 25:26.472
Yes.

25:26.472 --> 25:28.472
You sure? I...? Yeah.

25:28.472 --> 25:30.592
Great. Thank you.

25:30.592 --> 25:32.952
It's my contact officer from
the SARC team.

25:32.952 --> 25:35.192
Take it. I'll sort Luna out.

25:35.192 --> 25:36.432
Thanks.

25:37.512 --> 25:38.872
Hello.

25:40.072 --> 25:42.032
Yes.

25:42.032 --> 25:45.552
Guys, can you just be a bit
quieter, please?

25:45.552 --> 25:46.992
It's a hospital.

25:46.992 --> 25:48.632
You need to be way louder than that.

25:49.872 --> 25:51.072
Hello, kids?

25:52.672 --> 25:57.072
Kids! Can you be quiet if...if I
bought you some sweets?

25:57.072 --> 25:58.552
Yeah!

25:58.552 --> 26:02.112
That's a bad idea. If you think
they're energetic now,

26:02.112 --> 26:04.032
wait till the sugar kicks in.

26:04.032 --> 26:05.672
Actually, no sweets.

26:05.672 --> 26:08.392
Forget the sweets. Fruit, who'd
like some fruit?

26:08.392 --> 26:09.912
You said sweets!

26:09.912 --> 26:11.872
OK, who wants to go see Mummy?

26:11.872 --> 26:13.072
Me! Me! Me!

26:13.072 --> 26:15.592
But you're going to have to be very
quiet

26:15.592 --> 26:18.072
so you don't give her a headache,
yeah?

26:18.072 --> 26:19.112
Rash?

26:20.912 --> 26:22.312
Yeah, course.

26:22.312 --> 26:23.952
This way, kids, come on.

26:24.992 --> 26:26.992
Thank you.

26:26.992 --> 26:30.832
Right, young lady, we are going to
take another look at your head,

26:30.832 --> 26:32.592
and see if we can't get you out of
here

26:32.592 --> 26:34.312
in time for your date with a
surgeon.

26:34.312 --> 26:35.312
OK?

26:37.352 --> 26:38.752
Mum! Mum!

26:40.832 --> 26:42.672
Careful, I've got a sore chest.
Mum!

26:45.832 --> 26:49.512
Hey, that's kids cleared medically
and reunited with mum.

26:49.512 --> 26:51.392
I'm off to find an easier patient.

26:51.392 --> 26:54.032
Maybe someone with a gunshot wound
or a limb that's fallen off.

26:55.672 --> 26:57.312
How's Luna?

26:57.312 --> 27:00.312
She's just been sent for
an MRI scan.

27:00.312 --> 27:01.552
Just to be on the safe side.

27:01.552 --> 27:04.392
But I am hoping to have her out
in time for her operation.

27:04.392 --> 27:06.512
Will Luna die if she doesn't
have her operation?

27:08.272 --> 27:09.872
She looks well enough to me.

27:09.872 --> 27:12.512
I don't want Luna to die!
It will be my fault!

27:12.512 --> 27:16.792
That's not true. Your sister's a
survivor, it'll be all right, Josh.

27:16.792 --> 27:20.192
So if Luna's MRI isn't right,
you can't operate, then?

27:20.192 --> 27:22.112
It depends. Maybe not.

27:22.112 --> 27:24.192
Well, then, let's wait for the
results.

27:24.192 --> 27:25.512
Then we can decide.

27:25.512 --> 27:27.752
OK. I'll find out what's
happening with that.

27:32.632 --> 27:33.912
Is Mum OK?

27:33.912 --> 27:37.552
She's fine.
She's more worried about you.

27:37.552 --> 27:40.312
Mum's such a worrier.
Tell her I'm OK.

27:41.272 --> 27:42.952
Do you do that a lot?

27:42.952 --> 27:45.432
Tell her that you're OK
to stop her worrying?

27:46.632 --> 27:49.272
It's easier for everybody
if she doesn't worry.

27:50.712 --> 27:52.512
All right, then, see you in a bit.

27:52.512 --> 27:54.832
We'll be waiting for you when you
get back.

27:57.592 --> 27:58.792
Thank you.

27:58.792 --> 28:01.432
No worries. Any news?

28:03.152 --> 28:04.672
Yeah.

28:04.672 --> 28:07.392
Eddie's going to enter
a not guilty plea.

28:07.392 --> 28:08.752
Oh, Alicia.

28:08.752 --> 28:09.792
I'm so sorry.

28:11.152 --> 28:13.232
Are you sure you don't
want to go home?

28:13.232 --> 28:15.192
Mrs Beauchamp will understand.

28:15.192 --> 28:18.752
No, no, I want to stay busy,
thank you. OK.

28:18.752 --> 28:23.432
The CT unfortunately shows that you
have a tumour in your bladder,

28:23.432 --> 28:28.432
and there are areas of abnormality
on the liver as well.

28:31.112 --> 28:32.952
I'm afraid so, I'm sorry.

28:34.192 --> 28:37.632
It'll be all right, Reg. What
happens now?

28:37.632 --> 28:39.832
Well, we'll admit you, obviously,

28:39.832 --> 28:42.792
and then you'll be referred to the
oncology team.

28:42.792 --> 28:44.912
They'll probably want to talk
to you

28:44.912 --> 28:46.912
about what you want to happen next.

28:46.912 --> 28:48.792
I just want to go home.

28:48.792 --> 28:51.552
Reggie, after all your treatment,

28:51.552 --> 28:54.672
it's almost certain you'll need a
different level of care.

28:54.672 --> 28:57.752
What do you mean?
I'm never going back?

28:58.792 --> 29:00.192
It's unlikely.

29:00.192 --> 29:01.992
I want to go.

29:01.992 --> 29:03.432
No, no...

29:03.432 --> 29:04.832
Stay there for the time being.

29:04.832 --> 29:07.712
I can't be here, I promised Rosie
and Jim and Billy

29:07.712 --> 29:09.912
I'd be a part of the
bridge foursome tonight.

29:09.912 --> 29:13.352
And I've got to chair the
book club tomorrow.

29:13.352 --> 29:16.232
As I said, I think you're going to
be with us for a little while.

29:16.232 --> 29:19.272
You can't keep me here! Reggie, it's
important that you trust us.

29:19.272 --> 29:21.792
OK, you need urgent treatment.
What we're going to do is

29:21.792 --> 29:24.392
move you somewhere a bit more
comfortable, all right?

29:24.392 --> 29:26.752
Can we arrange for somebody to
find a bed on the ward? Yeah.

29:32.872 --> 29:34.872
I've got good news.

29:34.872 --> 29:38.792
The MRI gave us a better view of the
abnormal area on Luna's scan.

29:39.792 --> 29:43.392
It's not a bleed, it's just a small
calcified area,

29:43.392 --> 29:45.472
which is nothing to worry about.

29:45.472 --> 29:49.832
People with chronic kidney problems
tend to get more calcium deposits.

29:49.832 --> 29:51.712
So I can have my operation?

29:51.712 --> 29:53.392
I've given theatre the heads-up.

29:53.392 --> 29:54.992
They're ready for you now.

29:54.992 --> 29:56.832
I just need you to sign the
consent forms.

29:56.832 --> 29:59.872
We've even booked our speediest
porter to get you there pronto.

29:59.872 --> 30:01.552
Wait. Are we sure?

30:02.872 --> 30:04.472
Yeah, absolutely.

30:04.472 --> 30:08.352
I mean, shouldn't we keep an eye on
Luna overnight, just to be safe?

30:08.352 --> 30:12.712
Look, I've checked her thoroughly,
we've had scans, MRI, regular obs.

30:12.712 --> 30:13.712
It will be totally safe.

30:13.712 --> 30:15.112
It's just, her father's not here.

30:15.112 --> 30:17.112
It's OK, Mum.

30:17.112 --> 30:18.592
I'm not scared.

30:18.592 --> 30:20.832
It is OK to be scared,
you know, Luna.

30:20.832 --> 30:23.072
We all get scared at times.

30:23.072 --> 30:24.472
What makes you scared?

30:24.472 --> 30:25.672
Me?

30:26.912 --> 30:31.192
My boss. Spiders, definitely.

30:32.032 --> 30:34.032
People touching my toes.

30:35.312 --> 30:37.992
And my patients not getting
the operations that they need.

30:37.992 --> 30:40.072
Is that why you looked sad today?

30:40.072 --> 30:41.712
You were worried about Luna?

30:43.352 --> 30:44.792
Yeah.

30:45.752 --> 30:47.432
I don't know, it's just,

30:47.432 --> 30:51.392
if something happened and I was in a
hospital bed,

30:51.392 --> 30:53.112
it just feels wrong.

30:53.112 --> 30:56.552
Maybe we should wait until
we're both fully recovered.

30:57.952 --> 31:02.232
Luna can be all right today but in
three months' time, you know,

31:02.232 --> 31:04.072
it could be a different story.

31:04.072 --> 31:05.672
Theresa, this is the best chance

31:05.672 --> 31:08.112
that she has had all of her
life to get well again.

31:08.112 --> 31:09.792
You need to take it.

31:12.632 --> 31:14.432
OK, I am scared.

31:15.512 --> 31:19.192
But not so scared that I don't want
to have the chance to be normal,

31:19.192 --> 31:20.552
like everybody else.

31:20.552 --> 31:23.912
I don't want to be sick all my
life and then die.

31:25.872 --> 31:27.432
I should have the operation, Mum.

31:27.432 --> 31:28.472
And when I wake up,

31:28.472 --> 31:32.072
Daddy will be here and we can all
talk about going to Disneyland.

31:32.072 --> 31:35.672
Every minute counts with live
organ transplants.

31:52.472 --> 31:57.232
What's this? I drew it for you.
Aw, that's very pretty.

31:57.232 --> 32:00.392
Whenever Luna's sad,
I draw her a picture.

32:00.392 --> 32:01.992
Thank you for helping my sister.

32:01.992 --> 32:05.552
Oh, that's OK.

32:05.552 --> 32:09.472
Aw, don't you give
the best hugs ever?

32:09.472 --> 32:11.112
Thank you.

32:11.112 --> 32:12.432
It's OK.

32:15.832 --> 32:17.632
It'll be all right, Reg.

32:21.632 --> 32:24.712
Now that they know, they'll be able
to look after you properly.

32:24.712 --> 32:26.552
It's definitely for the best.

32:26.552 --> 32:28.352
Is it?

32:32.112 --> 32:33.632
Go on.

32:35.912 --> 32:38.712
No, no, no, that's not a good idea.

32:39.672 --> 32:41.992
Stiff drink. Cures all sorts of
things.

32:41.992 --> 32:43.152
Right OK.

32:43.152 --> 32:45.872
Hey, that's a 25-year old single
malt I've been saving

32:45.872 --> 32:47.872
for a special occasion.

32:47.872 --> 32:50.512
Me dying? That's a special occasion?

32:50.512 --> 32:54.512
You know what I mean,
Reg. I'm sad as well.

32:54.512 --> 32:56.832
To be honest, the way things are
going at the moment,

32:56.832 --> 32:58.552
I'd happily join you in one but if I
did,

32:58.552 --> 33:00.872
I'd end up a week from now
in Hong Kong

33:00.872 --> 33:03.272
with a Russian bride and a new
tattoo.

33:03.272 --> 33:05.552
You can have that back later.

33:06.872 --> 33:09.792
Reggie, we've got a room ready
for you upstairs.

33:09.792 --> 33:10.952
What about me?

33:11.872 --> 33:13.672
You? How do you mean?

33:13.672 --> 33:16.872
Well, where will I go?
I'll be all alone in the home now.

33:16.872 --> 33:19.392
That was your choice, Joe.

33:19.392 --> 33:22.232
You're the one who treats the others
like they're all idiots,

33:22.232 --> 33:24.632
like you're too good to be there.

33:24.632 --> 33:26.272
Reg!

33:26.272 --> 33:29.752
Look, all you're worried about
is being alone.

33:29.752 --> 33:34.152
I'm dying and you're thinking of
yourself? I was happy there.

33:34.152 --> 33:38.232
Now I don't even get to a chance to
say goodbye to my friends.

33:38.232 --> 33:42.272
Just because I tried to do
you a favour this morning.

33:45.072 --> 33:47.272
I'd rather not have known.

33:47.272 --> 33:49.032
I know I can't live for ever.

33:49.032 --> 33:52.432
But I always wanted
to just keep going.

33:53.712 --> 33:55.472
Until I couldn't any more.

33:55.472 --> 33:58.752
Then let it end quickly.

33:59.992 --> 34:01.032
Not this way.

34:01.032 --> 34:04.352
Not having to hear everything that's
wrong with me

34:04.352 --> 34:07.752
and what can or what can't be done
about it.

34:07.752 --> 34:11.352
OK, well, we're going to move
you upstairs now.

34:11.352 --> 34:16.432
Now, Joseph, I think that Louise has
organised for you to be taken home.

34:17.272 --> 34:18.752
Yes.

34:18.752 --> 34:21.712
Ms Carter would like to talk to you
about

34:21.712 --> 34:24.552
arranging alternative accommodation.

34:24.552 --> 34:26.352
She thinks you're not happy.

34:26.352 --> 34:29.592
"Disruptive" was the term she used.

34:29.592 --> 34:32.032
Alternative accomm... Where?

34:33.912 --> 34:38.192
I don't think we know, but I'm sure
she'll discuss the options with you.

34:39.792 --> 34:42.392
Reg, I'll come and
visit, I promise.

34:50.352 --> 34:52.352
What have you done to your face?

34:52.352 --> 34:54.552
I was in an accident.

34:54.552 --> 34:56.872
What sort of accident?

34:56.872 --> 34:58.072
A car crash.

34:58.072 --> 34:59.912
Oh. I'm sorry.

34:59.912 --> 35:01.512
Is your car OK?

35:02.752 --> 35:05.392
I was in an ambulance,
funnily enough.

35:05.392 --> 35:07.832
Was the patient OK?

35:07.832 --> 35:08.992
I was the patient.

35:08.992 --> 35:10.472
Why?

35:10.472 --> 35:12.312
I fell though a glass door.

35:12.312 --> 35:14.912
That's enough questions, Luna.

35:14.912 --> 35:16.152
It's OK.

35:16.152 --> 35:17.792
How did you do that?

35:17.792 --> 35:21.632
Um... Somebody pushed me.

35:23.072 --> 35:24.432
Did they get in trouble?

35:24.432 --> 35:25.512
Yes.

35:25.512 --> 35:26.952
Good.

35:26.952 --> 35:29.952
If somebody did that to me I would
give them such a telling-off

35:29.952 --> 35:31.992
that they'd never do it again. Quite
right too.

35:31.992 --> 35:35.272
Hey, listen, good luck.

35:35.272 --> 35:38.032
I'll come and find you
later, see how it went.

35:38.032 --> 35:40.192
Thank you, Dr Munroe.

35:40.192 --> 35:41.432
No worries.

35:44.792 --> 35:46.352
See you later.

35:51.912 --> 35:54.752
I think Theresa was more
frightened than Luna.

35:54.752 --> 35:56.952
What an amazing young girl.
She's got guts.

35:58.832 --> 36:01.072
I think there's something
that I need to do.

36:02.912 --> 36:04.112
Which one was it? Number 15?

36:04.112 --> 36:05.112
Yeah, think so.

36:08.392 --> 36:12.192
I mean, if anybody should have got
the letter, it should have been you.

36:12.192 --> 36:15.912
Maybe I'm crediting
Human Resources with a brain.

36:15.912 --> 36:18.992
Or a heart.
Or some sort of humanity, anyway.

36:18.992 --> 36:20.472
You ready for this?

36:20.472 --> 36:21.592
Let's do this.

36:24.752 --> 36:26.232
Wow.

36:30.112 --> 36:33.432
Wow. Is that a bag,
shall we use that?

36:33.432 --> 36:34.592
Yeah. Yeah.

36:35.792 --> 36:37.192
Look at all this.

36:39.552 --> 36:40.632
Oh, my word.

36:42.752 --> 36:43.952
She kept that.

36:45.072 --> 36:46.472
What's that?

36:47.592 --> 36:51.032
When we got married, we
had our honeymoon in Paris.

36:52.472 --> 36:53.952
Just a couple of nights.

36:53.952 --> 36:56.712
We didn't have money, so...
Cheap and cheerful.

36:58.112 --> 37:00.592
Right, shall we do the
big stuff first?

37:00.592 --> 37:01.552
Yeah, let's go.

37:15.432 --> 37:17.032
I hear you're going to
plead not guilty.

37:17.032 --> 37:18.432
That's right.

37:18.432 --> 37:20.272
You shouldn't be speaking
to each other.

37:20.272 --> 37:21.912
The judge will take a very dim view

37:21.912 --> 37:23.912
if you're seen together
before proceedings.

37:23.912 --> 37:25.152
Because I'm not.

37:25.152 --> 37:28.992
Do you think? That's good,
because you know what, Eddie?

37:28.992 --> 37:30.832
I want this to go to trial.

37:30.832 --> 37:32.032
Then everything comes out.

37:34.112 --> 37:35.752
I'm guessing he's never told you

37:35.752 --> 37:37.872
exactly why he was at my flat that
night?

37:40.392 --> 37:43.512
I am tired of worrying about
what other people think.

37:43.512 --> 37:46.472
So plead not guilty,
take it to trial, I dare you.

37:46.472 --> 37:48.672
Do it.

37:48.672 --> 37:50.312
I'll be watching.

37:50.312 --> 37:53.152
And I will stand and cheer when you
plead not guilty

37:53.152 --> 37:56.032
because I cannot
wait to be called to give evidence.

37:57.632 --> 38:00.272
Then I get to tell the world,
on public record,

38:00.272 --> 38:02.152
exactly what kind of man you
are.

38:04.752 --> 38:06.352
I'll see you in there.

38:09.912 --> 38:11.272
We should talk.

38:15.512 --> 38:17.272
Will the defendant please rise?

38:22.392 --> 38:25.312
How do you plead?
Guilty or not guilty?

38:38.912 --> 38:39.952
Guilty.

38:46.192 --> 38:47.432
I plead guilty.

38:56.552 --> 38:58.112
I'll just grab a clean shirt.
Great.

38:59.392 --> 39:01.312
What?

39:01.312 --> 39:05.352
It must be those kids we had running
wild in paediatrics today.

39:05.352 --> 39:08.712
They got bored out there and
decided to pay me a visit!

39:08.712 --> 39:11.352
What's happened?
It's OK, I'll get it sorted.

39:11.352 --> 39:12.992
Can't the cleaners do it?

39:12.992 --> 39:16.072
All my files are all over the shop.
No, I've got to do it.

39:16.072 --> 39:18.872
Right, sorry, Charlie,
did you have a chance to speak to...

39:18.872 --> 39:21.952
I've put the word out about the Band
Six nurses and we've had a result.

39:21.952 --> 39:23.872
We'll have some helping hands...

39:23.872 --> 39:24.912
That's great.

39:26.072 --> 39:28.152
Don't worry, the inspectors won't
see it.

39:28.152 --> 39:29.672
I'll stay late and clear it up.

39:29.672 --> 39:30.792
What?

39:30.792 --> 39:31.912
I'll have to.

39:32.832 --> 39:33.992
No, Charlie.

39:33.992 --> 39:36.952
There's no two ways about it,
I've got to.

39:36.952 --> 39:38.392
Fine.

39:38.392 --> 39:39.792
I'll give your apologies.

39:39.792 --> 39:42.072
Tell her I'll make it up to her.

39:44.352 --> 39:47.352
I'll bring fish
and chips home later.

39:47.352 --> 39:48.552
Lovely.

39:52.592 --> 39:54.232
Do you know what the inspectors...

39:54.232 --> 39:55.872
Mrs Beauchamp, I'm so glad I caught
you.

39:55.872 --> 39:57.312
I thought you finished your shift?

39:57.312 --> 39:59.912
I had, I just want a quick word.

39:59.912 --> 40:03.392
OK. Really, Charlie, leave it.

40:03.392 --> 40:05.232
No, it's fine.

40:08.512 --> 40:10.152
Everything OK?

40:10.152 --> 40:14.112
Yes, I've just been thinking
about next steps.

40:14.112 --> 40:17.992
And I've decided I would like to
specialise in paediatrics.

40:18.832 --> 40:21.872
That's really good news,
really good news.

40:21.872 --> 40:24.552
Well, I'll make sure you're on the
rota for the Children's ED.

40:24.552 --> 40:26.272
Thank you.

40:26.272 --> 40:27.992
Yeah, I'm really pleased
to hear that.

40:27.992 --> 40:29.152
Me too.

40:29.152 --> 40:30.872
OK, well done.

40:53.112 --> 40:54.952
DOORBELL RINGS

40:54.952 --> 40:57.232
Yes, it was a lovely party.

40:57.232 --> 40:58.632
See you again soon.

40:58.632 --> 40:59.912
Bye. Bye.

41:04.312 --> 41:06.752
Duffy, is that you?

41:06.752 --> 41:09.352
I don't believe it, Bill?
Bill Crowthers?!

41:10.312 --> 41:12.192
You look great, as always.

41:12.192 --> 41:13.672
Aw, bless you.

41:13.672 --> 41:15.952
It's amazing what a bit of lipstick
and a new frock can do

41:15.952 --> 41:18.312
for a grandmother who's just
finished a 10-hour shift.

41:18.312 --> 41:21.952
I saw Jacqui and Jayden,
he's getting so big.

41:21.952 --> 41:26.512
Every time they come over, they
completely empty the fridge.

41:26.512 --> 41:27.872
Are you leaving already?

41:27.872 --> 41:30.712
They've starting to wind the kids
down for bathtime and bed.

41:30.712 --> 41:31.672
How's your Rachael?

41:32.952 --> 41:34.952
Ahh... That's a...that's a
long story.

41:38.872 --> 41:41.112
Need
to tell you that one over a drink.

41:41.112 --> 41:44.792
Oh, well,
I'm in no hurry if you're not.

41:44.792 --> 41:46.752
There's a pub round the corner.

41:48.992 --> 41:50.032
Actually...

41:52.232 --> 41:53.272
..yes.

41:54.312 --> 41:56.552
A drink would be lovely.

41:56.552 --> 41:59.072
I'm sure Jacqui and Jayden won't
mind staying a bit longer.

41:59.072 --> 42:00.392
OK, then.

42:00.392 --> 42:02.112
Lead the way.

42:05.472 --> 42:07.912
I just want the bolognese to
simmer a little longer.

42:07.912 --> 42:10.552
I've never had a man
cook for me before.

42:11.512 --> 42:12.952
Well, apart from Iain.

42:12.952 --> 42:15.952
But that doesn't really count
because he's my brother.

42:15.952 --> 42:19.192
And when I say cook, I mean pour
some cereal into a bowl.

42:19.192 --> 42:21.512
You'll have to teach me
how to make it.

42:21.512 --> 42:23.312
Maybe wait till you've tried it
first,

42:23.312 --> 42:25.472
just to be sure you want to know.

42:25.472 --> 42:29.032
I can boil an egg.
Make some toast. Things like that.

42:29.032 --> 42:31.432
Great. You can be in charge of
breakfast, then.

42:32.792 --> 42:34.952
Staying for breakfast, am I?

42:34.952 --> 42:37.752
Oh, well, I mean...only if it
suits.

42:37.752 --> 42:41.232
If you're too tired to go home
and just want to crash, maybe.

42:44.032 --> 42:45.672
I'd love to stay for breakfast.

42:46.992 --> 42:49.952
And I don't have work tomorrow, so I
don't have to do the walk of shame.

42:50.992 --> 42:52.152
It was meant to be.

42:53.392 --> 42:55.992
I've never played doctors and nurses
with a real doctor before.

43:01.472 --> 43:03.232
I'll just stir the bolognese...

43:04.872 --> 43:06.512
In a minute...

43:11.032 --> 43:12.512
Rash! Hello! Rashid!

43:12.512 --> 43:16.352
Your dad only went and booked
through some American website

43:16.352 --> 43:17.992
and got the dates wrong.

43:17.992 --> 43:21.272
That thing where you put the month
before the day,

43:21.272 --> 43:22.912
and the hotel was full.

43:22.912 --> 43:25.512
Yes, you should go and hide
in the bathroom.

43:27.512 --> 43:29.552
Oh. Hello.

43:29.552 --> 43:32.392
Hi, Mum. Mum, Gem.

43:32.392 --> 43:34.072
Gem, Mum.

43:35.072 --> 43:38.712
I can smell food.
Don't tell me he cooked?

43:38.712 --> 43:40.632
There's plenty, if you're hungry.

43:40.632 --> 43:42.312
Famished. Let's see what's on offer.

43:46.032 --> 43:47.032
That's my mum.

43:47.032 --> 43:48.112
You said.

43:48.112 --> 43:49.872
Dad's upstairs.

43:51.152 --> 43:53.512
They live here as well.

43:53.512 --> 43:55.552
Well, that explains the baby photos.

43:55.552 --> 43:56.712
Oh!

43:58.192 --> 44:00.952
I guess we'll have to
wait for breakfast.

44:00.952 --> 44:03.472
Gem, I'm so sorry.
No, don't be.

44:04.712 --> 44:06.912
Let's just wait
until I get my own place.

44:06.912 --> 44:09.952
Then we can have breakfast
morning, noon and night.

44:09.952 --> 44:11.672
So, tell me about your day,
Dr Dashing.

44:11.672 --> 44:13.872
Did you save lives? Slay dragons?

44:15.272 --> 44:17.712
Whisk any impressionable young
nurses off their feet?

44:18.952 --> 44:20.152
No.

44:21.192 --> 44:26.232
I confiscated a 25-year-old single
malt from an obstinate octogenarian.

44:26.592 --> 44:29.472
Is that why you called me?
You're drunk?

44:29.472 --> 44:31.512
No.

44:31.512 --> 44:34.352
Chance would be a fine thing,
no, I had to give it back.

44:34.352 --> 44:35.432
Well done.

44:37.232 --> 44:41.192
No, I had to tell a very old man
that he was terminally ill.

44:42.712 --> 44:45.632
Then I had to clear out my
ex-wife's locker.

44:46.752 --> 44:48.072
The dead one.

44:48.072 --> 44:49.792
So that was a trip down memory lane.

44:50.832 --> 44:55.912
God, the universe, whatever,
a riot sometimes, ain't he?

44:59.312 --> 45:02.792
It's not too late to become an
accountant, you know.

45:02.792 --> 45:04.592
Postman.

45:04.592 --> 45:06.672
A massage therapist.

45:07.672 --> 45:10.032
I don't... Something less stressful.

45:11.152 --> 45:14.312
I think I'd find being a massage
therapist very stressful indeed.

45:15.272 --> 45:17.592
Rubbing all those
strange men with oil.

45:19.592 --> 45:22.192
You're hands-on with strangers every
day, aren't you?

45:22.192 --> 45:24.152
That's different, though. They're
bleeding.

45:24.152 --> 45:25.592
Most of the time, they're bleeding.

45:26.752 --> 45:28.992
Oi, oi, oi, oi.

45:28.992 --> 45:30.992
Sam. I made her life very
difficult at times...

45:30.992 --> 45:33.832
well, most of the time, to be
honest with you,

45:33.832 --> 45:37.072
but I did know she was always going
to be there for me

45:37.072 --> 45:38.152
if I needed her.

45:39.952 --> 45:41.992
I don't have that person
in my life any more.

45:43.912 --> 45:45.112
Yes...

45:46.312 --> 45:47.672
..you do.

46:06.592 --> 46:07.992
Goodness me.

46:10.232 --> 46:12.672
It's been a long time since I've
done anything like that.

46:12.672 --> 46:16.952
It's a long time since I've done
anything like that sober.

46:20.672 --> 46:24.112
So do you...want to come in
for that coffee now?

46:26.472 --> 46:27.952
Can the mutt come, too?

46:29.232 --> 46:31.432
I wouldn't have it any other way.

46:33.392 --> 46:35.192
Go on, then, you're on.
