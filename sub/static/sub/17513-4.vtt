WEBVTT

00:11.343 --> 00:13.791
- How far is it?
- It's about a four-hour walk.

00:13.816 --> 00:16.338
- What?!
- Just kidding. It's just over here.

00:16.621 --> 00:17.757
Does it have a rope ladder?

00:17.782 --> 00:20.224
It's not a tree house,
more of a... shed.

00:20.249 --> 00:22.391
- What'd you do in there?
- Just pretend I was in a tree house.

00:22.416 --> 00:25.065
Well, I'm gonna pretend I'm
little Daniel in the tree house.

00:25.090 --> 00:26.691
We actually don't have heaps of time.

00:26.716 --> 00:28.188
We've got a list of stuff
to do before we close today.

00:28.213 --> 00:30.530
- My list was better.
- Just the word 'pub' isn't a list.

00:30.555 --> 00:31.856
I can't believe we're
open on a Saturday.

00:31.881 --> 00:33.354
Oh, can you close your
eyes from this point?

00:33.355 --> 00:35.588
Why aren't I allowed to know
where your cubby house is?

00:35.613 --> 00:37.911
What if Robin never told
Batman where the Batcave was?

00:37.936 --> 00:39.402
Do you mean if Batman never told Robin?

00:40.420 --> 00:41.330
I'm Batman.

00:41.331 --> 00:42.905
No, no, I just want to
do a dramatic reveal.

00:42.930 --> 00:44.471
Oh, okay.

00:44.496 --> 00:45.354
- All right?
- Ready. Yep.

00:45.355 --> 00:46.374
Okay.

00:46.797 --> 00:47.997
Whoa. Rock.

00:51.008 --> 00:52.287
Oh! Ow!

00:52.312 --> 00:54.343
Yeah, sorry, I asked you
to close your eyes too soon.

00:54.539 --> 00:56.346
Okay, you can open them now.

00:58.370 --> 00:59.400
Wow!

00:59.425 --> 01:00.788
Yeah, it's pretty cool, isn't it?

01:01.195 --> 01:02.338
Mum and I put it together.

01:02.339 --> 01:04.628
It was just a spot near
school where I could hide

01:04.653 --> 01:08.407
from people trying to punch
me, dak me, pee in my bag.

01:08.432 --> 01:10.151
I can't believe Barbara
did this for you.

01:10.176 --> 01:12.485
Well, I mean, I helped, a little, but...

01:12.681 --> 01:15.318
yeah, she can be pretty
supportive when she's not being...

01:15.319 --> 01:16.371
very unsupportive.

01:16.741 --> 01:18.370
- Do you want to go inside?
- Yes!

01:18.371 --> 01:19.950
- Whoa.
- Whoo!

01:19.975 --> 01:21.498
You know, technically,
it's no girls allowed.

01:21.523 --> 01:23.471
Too late!

01:30.465 --> 01:34.421
Yeah. No wonder you didn't
let girls in here. Gross!

01:36.463 --> 01:39.264
- These... these aren't mine.
- Sure.

01:39.289 --> 01:41.404
No, no, none of this...
none of this is mine.

01:41.429 --> 01:43.421
This... someone else has been in here.

01:44.629 --> 01:47.326
It's Bruce! This...
this is Bruce's stuff.

01:47.327 --> 01:50.334
He's... he's turned my
cubby house into his own...

01:50.335 --> 01:51.937
porno... man cave.

01:51.962 --> 01:54.305
Who still buys porn magazines?
Doesn't he have a phone?

01:54.330 --> 01:56.301
How'd he find it?

01:56.575 --> 01:58.688
- Are you mad?
- Yes! I... I am.

01:58.713 --> 02:00.459
This... this is where I
came to get away from him,

02:00.484 --> 02:01.379
and now it's like a...

02:01.832 --> 02:02.897
Bruce shrine.

02:02.922 --> 02:04.522
- He's probably masturbated there.
- Ugh.

02:06.405 --> 02:07.605
Are you okay?

02:09.009 --> 02:11.952
I haven't... grown, Em.

02:11.977 --> 02:15.690
I still feel just as...
shit about all this stuff.

02:15.743 --> 02:16.943
I thought...

02:18.125 --> 02:22.323
running the business, showing Mum
I could do it, would... help, but...

02:23.323 --> 02:24.375
couldn't do that either.

02:25.318 --> 02:26.527
You did your best.

02:26.552 --> 02:29.865
Didn't sell any houses.
Didn't expand the rent roll.

02:29.890 --> 02:32.809
Mum's back tomorrow, and she's
not gonna want me sticking around.

02:33.113 --> 02:34.030
What about your list?

02:34.055 --> 02:35.552
We're gonna finish that today, right?

02:35.684 --> 02:36.817
It's all shitty office tasks.

02:36.842 --> 02:40.451
I'm not gonna redeem myself
by... restocking the tea bags.

02:41.107 --> 02:43.630
Well... I thought you did a great job.

02:43.655 --> 02:46.489
Well, I didn't, and now the
guy who made my childhood hell

02:46.514 --> 02:48.324
has got me babysitting his dog,

02:48.769 --> 02:50.818
and he's turned my
cubby house into his...

02:51.326 --> 02:52.642
Personal wank den?

02:52.667 --> 02:54.687
Yes. Thank you for that.

02:56.904 --> 02:58.322
You know what?

02:58.323 --> 03:01.378
If this is gonna be our
last day in Rosehaven,

03:01.680 --> 03:03.351
I've got something new for your list.

03:05.000 --> 03:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:46.603 --> 03:49.173
It's fine. I wasn't using it anyway.

03:49.439 --> 03:50.343
Shouldn't let it get to me.

03:50.344 --> 03:52.322
- I think you should confront him.
- Yeah.

03:52.323 --> 03:54.230
Really. Tomorrow you
leave this place forever.

03:54.255 --> 03:55.363
Well, I'll try to come
back for Christmas...

03:55.364 --> 03:57.715
Forever. So why not go and tell him off?

03:57.740 --> 03:59.012
Because I'm not in
primary school anymore.

03:59.037 --> 04:00.166
Exactly!

04:00.191 --> 04:02.687
I came here to escape my
problems, but you didn't.

04:02.712 --> 04:04.455
And I'm not going to let
you go back to Australia...

04:04.480 --> 04:05.825
- The mainland.
- with your head down.

04:05.850 --> 04:08.912
Today is all about Daniel
looking his childhood issues

04:08.937 --> 04:11.402
straight in the eye and
poking them with his fingers.

04:12.309 --> 04:14.603
And Bruce used to ruffle
my hair every day at school.

04:14.628 --> 04:16.067
Every day he'd just walk past and...

04:17.071 --> 04:18.370
ruin my fringe.

04:18.617 --> 04:20.362
He's a monster.

04:20.659 --> 04:23.651
I always imagined coming back
one day and ruining his fringe.

04:23.676 --> 04:25.358
Well, guess what day it is.

04:26.323 --> 04:27.387
What's the worst that can happen?

04:27.772 --> 04:29.358
He can't dak me. I'm wearing a belt.

04:29.445 --> 04:31.801
It'll be like a
hit-and-run for the soul.

04:32.911 --> 04:34.636
Yeah. You know what? You're right.

04:34.661 --> 04:36.534
I don't want to regret never
standing up to him my whole life.

04:36.559 --> 04:37.235
No, you do not.

04:37.260 --> 04:38.820
- I'm as tall as he is now.
- Yes, you are!

04:38.845 --> 04:40.812
- Let's do this!
- Whoo!

04:41.476 --> 04:42.854
I don't want to do this.

04:43.140 --> 04:45.286
- You don't have to fight him.
- I was never gonna fight him.

04:45.311 --> 04:47.252
You're just gonna tell him how
he hurt your feelings growing up

04:47.277 --> 04:48.398
so you can release your bitterness,

04:48.423 --> 04:50.055
then claim back what is rightfully yours

04:50.080 --> 04:51.781
and take your place
as king of Rosehaven.

04:52.078 --> 04:54.074
I'm just gonna tell him to move
his stuff out of my cubby house.

04:54.099 --> 04:55.405
Same thing. Go on.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.808
- Danny.
- Daniel.

05:10.868 --> 05:12.832
What can I do for you?

05:15.041 --> 05:16.241
Nothing.

05:17.449 --> 05:19.413
Better let you get back to it.

05:28.214 --> 05:30.225
Yep, Mr Rafter, it doesn't
matter if you're a lawyer or not.

05:30.250 --> 05:32.010
Your dog is still pooing
in the common areas.

05:33.225 --> 05:35.962
Well, it'd be quicker to put it
in the bin than post it to me.

05:36.104 --> 05:37.304
Thanks for your time.

05:38.708 --> 05:40.315
Are you ready to talk about it?

05:41.706 --> 05:43.390
No.

05:44.138 --> 05:47.018
Really? Let it out just a little?

05:47.043 --> 05:48.018
I changed my mind, okay?

05:48.043 --> 05:49.927
I... I don't care about the cubby
house and all that other stuff.

05:49.952 --> 05:51.951
It was... a long time ago.

05:52.030 --> 05:53.620
- It was my fault you choked.
- I didn't choke.

05:53.645 --> 05:55.366
You did, but it was my fault.

05:55.578 --> 05:56.761
It was too big a deal.

05:56.786 --> 05:58.727
I sent you to the final boss too soon.

05:58.752 --> 06:00.506
We need to level your
character up a bit.

06:00.531 --> 06:02.542
Get you to do some
smaller things, then Bruce.

06:02.567 --> 06:03.583
What things?

06:03.608 --> 06:05.943
Other unfinished childhood
business you have here.

06:05.968 --> 06:07.603
- I'm not a trapped spirit, Em.
- Come on!

06:07.628 --> 06:10.704
What's all the stuff that you wanted
to do growing up that you didn't?

06:12.033 --> 06:13.061
I don't know.

06:13.320 --> 06:14.920
Do you want to stand up to Bruce or not?

06:17.824 --> 06:19.335
- Yes.
- Good!

06:21.944 --> 06:23.374
What's this one?

06:23.700 --> 06:25.475
Mum never let me drink
juice after 9:00am.

06:25.500 --> 06:27.426
She said I wasn't a
movie star in Hollywood.

06:27.451 --> 06:29.415
Right. Well, it's 10:40.

06:30.439 --> 06:31.615
Okay.

06:37.026 --> 06:38.802
- So sweet.
- You got this.

06:43.265 --> 06:45.058
"Swing over creek." Easy.

06:45.083 --> 06:47.165
It's not. It's actually
more scary now I'm an adult.

06:47.190 --> 06:48.193
No!

06:48.319 --> 06:49.214
I weigh more now,

06:49.239 --> 06:51.759
and I'm pretty sure this is the
same rope from when I was a kid.

06:53.632 --> 06:55.131
You got this, buddy!

07:05.253 --> 07:07.240
That was... that was easy.

07:07.366 --> 07:09.385
I thought you were gonna fall in!

07:09.440 --> 07:11.420
Yeah, me too.

07:12.726 --> 07:14.423
- Bruce?
- Yeah.

07:18.124 --> 07:20.310
- How do I get back?
- I don't know.

07:20.311 --> 07:22.898
- Well, can you bring the car around?
- I don't know how to get over there.

07:22.923 --> 07:24.792
- Well, just Google Map it.
- You don't have an address.

07:24.817 --> 07:26.499
Am I supposed to type in "grass patch"?

07:26.524 --> 07:28.175
No, just open the app...

07:29.523 --> 07:31.009
- You ready?
- Hang on.

07:36.944 --> 07:39.556
- What... what are you doing?
- I want to look confident.

07:39.665 --> 07:40.651
Okay.

07:41.239 --> 07:42.996
You've... you've never stood like that.

07:43.064 --> 07:44.499
No one has. No one stands like that.

07:44.524 --> 07:45.973
- Well...
- Just stand normally.

07:45.998 --> 07:48.216
- How do I normally stand?
- I don't... You know, just stand.

07:48.241 --> 07:49.621
Not... weird.

07:51.441 --> 07:52.453
Better.

07:53.715 --> 07:55.214
Hey, Bruce!

07:59.407 --> 08:02.354
Danny! What are you
doing back here again?

08:02.864 --> 08:04.310
You know my cubby house?

08:04.311 --> 08:06.959
- Yeah...? Oh, my shed?
- Yes.

08:07.366 --> 08:07.825
No.

08:07.850 --> 08:09.494
- What about it?
- Well, I want you to stop...

08:09.519 --> 08:11.512
Why have you got your
hands in your pockets?

08:12.131 --> 08:13.223
What?

08:14.130 --> 08:16.125
Just... looks weird.

08:18.148 --> 08:19.348
No, it doesn't.

08:21.721 --> 08:23.342
At least you said
"cubby house" this time.

08:25.433 --> 08:26.762
This is worse than I thought.

08:26.787 --> 08:28.726
He really did a number on you.

08:30.689 --> 08:33.330
He replaced my sunscreen
with Liquid Paper once, so...

08:33.652 --> 08:35.333
We don't have to do this.

08:35.335 --> 08:36.534
I'm sorry I pushed you.

08:38.232 --> 08:41.690
Uh, what else do we
need to do today, hmm?

08:42.143 --> 08:43.253
Eh?

08:43.278 --> 08:45.325
Here we go. How about, um...

08:45.908 --> 08:47.950
Spellcheck the rental ads, that's good.

08:47.975 --> 08:49.403
No. No, no. No.

08:49.991 --> 08:51.330
I want to ruffle his hair.

08:52.567 --> 08:54.327
Okay. Let's step it up.

08:56.311 --> 08:58.350
I've changed my mind. I think Mum
was right not to let me do this.

08:58.351 --> 09:00.307
You just have to turn it on.

09:05.057 --> 09:06.546
How does it feel?

09:06.937 --> 09:08.631
I hate it!

09:09.041 --> 09:10.241
What?!

09:14.917 --> 09:17.554
- Don't worry, this is an easy one.
- Yeah...

09:22.004 --> 09:22.922
Hi.

09:24.636 --> 09:25.760
Oh.

09:26.556 --> 09:28.739
- What can I get you?
- Uh, nothing.

09:28.764 --> 09:33.480
Um, I was in here before and I
bought a steak and mushroom pie,

09:33.691 --> 09:36.342
and I'm pretty sure it
gave me food poisoning.

09:36.552 --> 09:38.252
- Oh.
- I thought you should know.

09:38.277 --> 09:39.477
When did you come in?

09:40.655 --> 09:41.554
1990.

09:42.907 --> 09:44.095
That was a long time ago.

09:44.189 --> 09:45.542
I wasn't even born.

09:45.683 --> 09:47.771
I know, but I remember it.

09:47.796 --> 09:51.378
Um, I... I ate it and then I spewed
a hundred metres from my house.

09:52.229 --> 09:53.539
It was also my birthday.

09:54.291 --> 09:56.466
So, how do you know it was
the pie that made you sick?

09:56.491 --> 09:58.515
Well, it... it was the
only thing I ate that day.

09:59.676 --> 10:01.639
A pie was the only thing you ate?

10:02.845 --> 10:03.869
Doesn't sound right.

10:03.894 --> 10:05.581
Well, I... I was sick.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.411
Sometimes the food
poisoning incubation period

10:08.436 --> 10:09.650
can be as long as 10 days.

10:09.675 --> 10:11.300
You sure know a lot about food poisoning

10:11.325 --> 10:13.064
for someone who hasn't
food-poisoned anyone.

10:13.089 --> 10:14.486
Can you please just apologise?

10:14.511 --> 10:15.827
I would if I thought it
was one of our products.

10:15.852 --> 10:17.052
Apologise!

10:20.139 --> 10:21.386
I'm sorry you're upset.

10:21.411 --> 10:23.012
That's an "I'm sorry you're
sorry". It doesn't count.

10:23.037 --> 10:24.316
- Yeah, but it's fine. I'm just...
- It's not fine.

10:24.341 --> 10:25.488
- It's fine?
- It is fine. Yeah, it's fine.

10:25.513 --> 10:27.452
- Okay.
- Okay, let's go.

10:40.292 --> 10:42.669
- How you feeling?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

10:42.694 --> 10:44.338
Is there anything you
wanted to do today?

10:44.339 --> 10:45.351
We can't do mine.

10:45.352 --> 10:48.366
I wanted Josh to turn up
and beg for my forgiveness.

10:48.898 --> 10:50.123
Do you want to get back with him?

10:50.901 --> 10:52.936
I want him to want me to. Is that crazy?

10:53.774 --> 10:54.355
No.

10:54.356 --> 10:56.362
You know what I would like? World peace.

10:56.544 --> 10:58.703
And for you to stand up to Bruce.

10:59.032 --> 11:00.321
Yeah, me too.

11:03.614 --> 11:06.322
Okay. Here we go.

11:06.323 --> 11:08.715
Swing and a miss!

11:09.112 --> 11:10.807
He would have sprayed us.

11:13.498 --> 11:14.449
Got it.

11:15.513 --> 11:17.223
Oh, not this, Em. A lot's changed.

11:17.248 --> 11:19.505
- You still like her though, right?
- Yes...

11:19.530 --> 11:21.892
Tell her how you feel.
Might get a goodbye pash.

11:21.917 --> 11:23.358
Might get rejected.

11:23.546 --> 11:24.745
Last day, remember.

11:25.019 --> 11:26.933
Just go in there and shake her hand.

11:26.958 --> 11:28.645
It is a very special breed of arsehole

11:28.677 --> 11:29.833
that can refuse an outstretched hand.

11:29.858 --> 11:31.441
- Well, then what do I do?
- You improvise.

11:31.466 --> 11:33.326
- Oh, what are you gonna open with?
- "Hey"?

11:33.510 --> 11:35.411
Good. Hey is good. Super casual.

11:35.436 --> 11:37.361
Hi's too intense. Hi's
like a charity mugger.

11:37.386 --> 11:38.847
It's like, "Hi! Do you
like tigers?" It's too much.

11:38.872 --> 11:41.308
- Well, what if she has patients?
- Invisible patients?

11:42.504 --> 11:43.391
Where are you going?

11:43.633 --> 11:46.507
Oh, I just thought I
might go say bye to Damien.

11:46.532 --> 11:48.358
The locksmith who unlocked your heart?

11:48.359 --> 11:50.334
Just shut up! It's my
last day too, remember?

11:50.335 --> 11:52.470
And plus, I'm not gonna wait
outside while you hit on the GP.

11:52.495 --> 11:53.695
She's probably busy.

11:55.307 --> 11:57.835
Love breaks all barriers
of time and space.

11:58.482 --> 11:59.403
Daniel.

11:59.997 --> 12:01.976
Plus, I made you an appointment.

12:05.211 --> 12:06.716
- You ready?
- Yep.

12:18.915 --> 12:20.322
How are you?

12:20.323 --> 12:22.906
Uh, good, thanks. Yeah, yeah, good.

12:22.931 --> 12:25.374
Then what are you doing here?

12:25.995 --> 12:27.576
- Uh, how are you...
- Shall we get started?

12:27.601 --> 12:29.581
- Sorry, you go.
- The mole scan.

12:31.431 --> 12:32.817
The... the mole... the mole scan?

12:32.842 --> 12:34.955
That's what I had you down for.

12:36.447 --> 12:38.217
Uh, yeah.

12:38.242 --> 12:42.229
Uh, just had one on my hand
I wanted you to have a...

12:42.376 --> 12:44.354
When was the last time you had a scan?

12:44.652 --> 12:45.852
Yesterday.

12:47.170 --> 12:48.198
Two years ago.

12:48.801 --> 12:50.041
Then we're doing the whole lot.

12:51.347 --> 12:53.021
Can you take your shirt and pants off?

13:01.925 --> 13:03.632
It's actually lucky you got
me. I was about to head out.

13:03.657 --> 13:05.585
- Oh, really?
- No.

13:06.491 --> 13:08.370
You really feel kind of
hidden in here, don't you?

13:08.738 --> 13:10.063
Yeah, I think they call it nesting.

13:10.088 --> 13:13.302
Oh. I'd say it feels more like a burrow.

13:13.761 --> 13:14.961
- Do you want a drink?
- Sure.

13:16.638 --> 13:18.265
What's this music?

13:18.290 --> 13:20.872
I'm not sure. It's just sort
of instrumentals on shuffle.

13:24.700 --> 13:25.903
Actually, there's a track in there

13:25.928 --> 13:30.014
that makes you feel like
a Frenchman writing poetry,

13:30.039 --> 13:32.475
about to throw a glass
of wine against a wall.

13:32.500 --> 13:34.083
But most of it's pretty upbeat.

13:34.108 --> 13:35.627
Ah. Awesome.

13:36.311 --> 13:38.025
Well, Daniel and I are leaving Rosehaven

13:38.050 --> 13:40.459
and he's doing his goodbyes,
so I thought I would too.

13:40.968 --> 13:42.607
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

13:42.632 --> 13:44.055
Thing is, I haven't actually
met that many people,

13:44.080 --> 13:45.873
so I don't actually
have that many goodbyes,

13:45.898 --> 13:47.874
and, um, I really liked...

13:48.112 --> 13:49.152
your house.

14:38.496 --> 14:40.799
So, I'm, um... leaving tomorrow.

14:41.856 --> 14:43.607
Are you? That's a shame.

14:43.915 --> 14:45.779
Yeah. Yeah. Mum gets back, so...

14:47.437 --> 14:48.731
Danny, your breathing's quite shallow.

14:48.756 --> 14:50.060
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

14:50.085 --> 14:52.734
I'm just looking at your
body with a magnifying glass.

14:52.759 --> 14:54.303
It's nothing to worry about.

14:54.897 --> 14:55.913
Sorry, what are you...?

14:56.102 --> 14:58.660
I'm taking a photo of the
spots I want to keep an eye on.

14:58.685 --> 15:00.310
Right. Of course.

15:03.844 --> 15:05.402
So, I, um...

15:05.895 --> 15:08.879
think I still like you.

15:10.331 --> 15:12.182
As a... as a friend, obviously.

15:12.207 --> 15:14.266
I mean, not as a friend, but, um...

15:14.292 --> 15:16.340
I mean, you are my friend, but, um...

15:21.046 --> 15:24.013
- Oh!
- Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

15:24.179 --> 15:26.664
I'm sorry. Uh, that was, um...

15:26.726 --> 15:29.121
I'm sorry. I should have asked, uh, you.

15:29.146 --> 15:31.045
No, I... should have checked.

15:31.070 --> 15:32.793
I should have waited till I
had clothes on. Um, I'm sorry.

15:32.818 --> 15:34.932
I should.. I... just your face was very
close and I was worried you'd say no.

15:34.957 --> 15:36.720
- And I'm sorry. I'm sorry about this.
- Yeah, Daniel,

15:36.745 --> 15:39.954
um... I'm just not used to patients
trying to kiss me, that's all.

15:39.979 --> 15:41.227
No. Well, why would you be? Um...

15:41.252 --> 15:43.394
I don't know. Maybe it's
a thing that... happens.

15:43.559 --> 15:45.215
Have you tried to kiss a doctor before?

15:45.240 --> 15:47.745
No, it was you... specific. I'm sorry.

15:47.770 --> 15:50.710
Um, I'm in my underpants. I'm gonna go.

15:58.034 --> 15:59.234
Olive.

16:10.003 --> 16:11.451
Are Saturdays always this quiet?

16:11.476 --> 16:14.420
No. A little treat for us.

16:16.708 --> 16:18.136
I'm back!

16:21.288 --> 16:22.685
You booked me in for a mole scan.

16:22.710 --> 16:25.139
You haven't been in two
years. You're welcome.

16:25.164 --> 16:26.725
I forgot to ask if she found anything.

16:26.750 --> 16:29.585
So? Did you tell her you liked her?

16:30.195 --> 16:31.378
Yes.

16:31.812 --> 16:33.540
- In my undies.
- Brave choice.

16:33.565 --> 16:35.366
Not a choice. Mole scan.

16:35.675 --> 16:37.961
- Then I tried to kiss her.
- Did you?

16:38.363 --> 16:39.387
Jinx!

16:39.461 --> 16:41.203
What do you mean, jinx?

16:41.719 --> 16:43.125
I kissed Damien.

16:43.225 --> 16:45.854
- Really?
- Yeah. In the daytime.

16:47.457 --> 16:50.334
Well, I didn't kiss
Grace. I just... leaned in.

16:50.335 --> 16:52.229
Okay. Well... well, that's still good.

16:52.254 --> 16:55.171
She leaned away, and then I
walked outside with no clothes on.

16:55.202 --> 16:57.402
Probably got sunburnt and
have to get another mole scan.

16:58.671 --> 17:00.988
Okay. That sounds terrible.

17:02.127 --> 17:05.126
But you did something that
young you would never have done.

17:05.391 --> 17:06.914
Yeah, I guess.

17:07.272 --> 17:08.473
You're ready.

17:10.260 --> 17:11.282
Final boss?

17:26.609 --> 17:27.906
He's not home.

17:28.754 --> 17:29.730
Sorry, mate.

17:30.781 --> 17:32.793
- Let's leave a note.
- Hm?

17:35.491 --> 17:38.781
"Fuck... you.

17:39.092 --> 17:40.639
- "From Dan."
- No. No, no, no...

17:40.664 --> 17:43.326
- "From Daniel."
- No, no. No, it doesn't... no...

18:00.143 --> 18:01.972
Come on! Quick!

18:02.104 --> 18:03.648
Come on, come on, come on!

18:04.351 --> 18:05.836
If you set those off when work finishes,

18:05.861 --> 18:07.808
you'll have to stay
behind and clean it up.

18:08.991 --> 18:11.764
Boom! Blam!

18:11.789 --> 18:14.741
Just as powerful.

18:15.748 --> 18:17.346
Goodnight, you two.

18:17.485 --> 18:19.660
Oh, um, Mrs Marsh.

18:20.378 --> 18:24.103
Uh, I... I know we've only worked
together for a small amount of time,

18:24.128 --> 18:26.711
but I've always appreciated your...

18:27.315 --> 18:28.128
work.

18:28.153 --> 18:29.161
Thanks, Daniel.

18:29.328 --> 18:31.374
I know you're hard on yourself,

18:31.544 --> 18:34.348
but you always got here on time,

18:34.373 --> 18:36.721
and the photocopier's working again.

18:38.248 --> 18:39.316
Thank you.

18:40.407 --> 18:41.877
See you at Christmas.

18:41.902 --> 18:43.193
- Bye!
- Bye.

18:48.499 --> 18:50.022
- Pub?
- Pub.

19:26.952 --> 19:29.932
Hey, I just realised
you're not my boss anymore.

19:29.957 --> 19:30.993
Uh, no.

19:31.018 --> 19:32.997
- No, no, I... I guess you're right.
- Great.

19:34.303 --> 19:35.558
You just going to leave
them there like that?

19:35.583 --> 19:36.475
Yeah.

19:37.323 --> 19:38.683
How are you gonna drink your wine?

19:44.444 --> 19:45.379
You got me.

19:45.836 --> 19:47.451
Hey, why don't you
ask, uh, Damien to come?

19:47.476 --> 19:49.326
Nah, he doesn't like people.

19:49.471 --> 19:52.065
Or public places. Or leaving his house.

19:52.205 --> 19:54.846
Maybe he doesn't want to come
because you don't kiss good.

19:55.298 --> 19:56.656
I kiss real good.

19:56.681 --> 19:59.310
I think you're just jealous
because you didn't get a kiss.

19:59.335 --> 20:00.535
Yeah.

20:02.024 --> 20:04.338
Oh, I'm sorry you didn't
get a kiss in your undies.

20:04.471 --> 20:06.132
I mean, that you didn't kiss
her while you were wearing...

20:06.157 --> 20:07.896
Yep, yep, got it. Thank you. Thank you.

20:07.921 --> 20:09.968
And also, you never beat the big boss.

20:09.993 --> 20:13.060
No, no, I'm... I'm glad.
I... I'm glad he wasn't there.

20:13.085 --> 20:15.875
I've got to... I've got to let it go.

20:15.900 --> 20:18.233
I've given that man too
much... too much brain time.

20:18.258 --> 20:19.363
Right.

20:20.117 --> 20:21.592
Bruce is a piece of shit.

20:21.969 --> 20:23.169
Oi, oi.

20:25.375 --> 20:26.948
G'day. Just a beer, thanks, mate.

20:26.973 --> 20:30.024
Did he... did he hear me?

20:30.723 --> 20:31.658
Nah.

20:33.642 --> 20:36.339
Hey, Bruce! You're a piece of shit!

20:37.339 --> 20:39.354
- What?
- You...

20:39.434 --> 20:41.433
You... you... you heard me.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.149
Just here for a beer, mate.

20:43.174 --> 20:45.682
Yeah, I'm not your mate. And
I want my cubby house back.

20:45.707 --> 20:47.374
Oh, f...

20:47.671 --> 20:49.890
Hey, you left. Get over it.

20:49.915 --> 20:50.666
How was I supposed to know

20:50.691 --> 20:52.477
you'd come crawling
back from the mainland?

20:52.502 --> 20:54.334
- Couldn't hack it.
- It's just a shitty shed.

20:54.335 --> 20:55.966
Yeah, it is now...

20:56.335 --> 20:59.306
It is now you've turned
it into a porn shed, okay?

20:59.307 --> 21:00.908
That's been my space
since I was a kid, Bruce.

21:00.933 --> 21:02.132
I built it with my mum.

21:04.851 --> 21:06.979
- All right, Danny, relax.
- Yeah, it's Daniel.

21:07.004 --> 21:08.706
And I want your stuff out of there.

21:09.041 --> 21:10.346
Sure thing...

21:10.606 --> 21:11.391
Danny.

21:11.793 --> 21:12.982
Hey, hey, hey, let's go.

21:13.007 --> 21:14.626
Come on, let's go. You did it. Good job.

21:14.651 --> 21:15.725
Fuck you, mate!

21:15.750 --> 21:18.126
- That was Dan's childhood space.
- Yeah!

21:18.151 --> 21:19.771
Okay, well, I guess you're
gonna have to find another...

21:19.796 --> 21:21.376
place to have no friends in.

21:21.401 --> 21:23.385
No...? I'm his friend,
and we went there today

21:23.410 --> 21:25.620
and totally fooled
around on all your stuff!

21:25.667 --> 21:27.855
Yeah, you... you think you
can just push me around, Bruce?

21:27.880 --> 21:30.334
You can't now, okay? I'm
a... I'm a property manager.

21:30.335 --> 21:32.350
- He's a manager!
- All right, all right.

21:32.406 --> 21:33.774
I think it's time for
you two to go home.

21:33.799 --> 21:34.626
You've had a little bit too much.

21:34.651 --> 21:37.505
- Yeah, too much of your shit!
- Oh, nice.

21:43.866 --> 21:46.326
If you hadn't have fallen
over, you could have taken him.

21:46.374 --> 21:47.422
I doubt it.

21:48.029 --> 21:49.808
I almost fell on Mrs Marsh.

21:50.115 --> 21:51.146
Didn't even see her come in.

21:51.505 --> 21:52.418
She thought it was funny.

21:52.443 --> 21:53.861
- Really?
- No.

21:54.861 --> 21:57.158
I shouldn't have made you
do all that stuff today.

21:57.183 --> 21:58.733
No, no, it was...

21:59.045 --> 22:00.985
it was... it was good for me. I...

22:01.030 --> 22:04.053
Apart from falling over
and getting arrested, I...

22:04.468 --> 22:05.395
had fun.

22:05.919 --> 22:07.882
- We were in a bar fight!
- Yeah.

22:08.759 --> 22:10.885
I... I'm ready to leave now, but...

22:11.479 --> 22:12.375
thanks for today, Em.

22:12.769 --> 22:14.394
Aww!

22:14.995 --> 22:16.445
It was fun, wasn't it?

22:17.911 --> 22:19.270
No!

22:22.769 --> 22:24.046
Everyone feeling better?

22:24.071 --> 22:27.587
Greg, I am so sorry. It was
just a... little disagreement.

22:27.632 --> 22:29.354
Bruce and I have sorted it out, so...

22:29.574 --> 22:32.591
I'd actually say that there's
more animosity between us now.

22:32.616 --> 22:33.387
He's joking.

22:33.673 --> 22:34.981
Look, I'm sorry about this, team,

22:35.006 --> 22:36.730
but you didn't give
me much of an option.

22:36.973 --> 22:38.011
Can you take a photo for me?

22:38.036 --> 22:39.366
Weren't there enough people
at the pub taking photos?

22:39.367 --> 22:41.516
But here we're behind bars. I
can tell Josh I'm on death row.

22:41.541 --> 22:43.322
It was nothing. It was
a heated discussion.

22:43.347 --> 22:45.649
- He called me a piece of shit, Dad.
- I was kidding.

22:45.674 --> 22:47.807
Look, I love you all equally.

22:48.112 --> 22:49.096
Huh?

22:49.121 --> 22:51.074
Yeah, look, we should...
probably get going.

22:51.099 --> 22:53.028
I've got to pack for
tomorrow, so if you...

22:53.100 --> 22:55.595
I'll get us all a pizza
so you guys can sober up.

22:56.931 --> 22:59.515
Oh, don't forget to get the
garlic bread this time, Dad!

23:21.339 --> 23:23.338
Mum, what are you...
what are you doing here?

23:23.440 --> 23:25.775
- My son got arrested.
- What are you doing here?

23:25.800 --> 23:27.314
It wasn't his fault.

23:27.315 --> 23:29.343
- It was.
- Hi, Barbara.

23:30.578 --> 23:31.824
I was going to let them out.

23:31.849 --> 23:34.350
Well, I wasn't even going to
put them in, standard procedure.

23:34.648 --> 23:36.824
Practically everybody in
town saw what they did,

23:36.849 --> 23:38.829
so I had to do something.

23:39.682 --> 23:43.342
But, uh, it's good to use
the cells every now and then,

23:43.343 --> 23:44.447
what with all this talk

23:44.472 --> 23:47.971
about closing the single-man...
one-man stations.

23:47.996 --> 23:49.173
Gotta seem useful.

23:49.198 --> 23:50.372
That's fine, Greg.

23:50.858 --> 23:52.362
You look good.

23:52.537 --> 23:54.614
- Cane new?
- It's temporary.

23:54.692 --> 23:55.761
I think it looks great.

23:55.786 --> 23:57.354
Mum, are... are you okay?

23:57.410 --> 23:58.706
If you were that
worried about my health,

23:58.731 --> 24:01.023
you wouldn't have got arrested
and made me get out of rehab.

24:01.100 --> 24:02.768
Oh, Barbara, I had no idea.

24:03.237 --> 24:04.556
Not for drugs, Greg.

24:04.659 --> 24:05.813
I am... I am so sorry.

24:05.838 --> 24:07.666
Really sorry. Nothing bad happened.

24:07.691 --> 24:09.294
How do you expect to work here now?

24:10.116 --> 24:12.824
Well, it... it's my...
it's my last day, isn't it?

24:12.910 --> 24:14.681
Obviously I'll need you to
stick around a bit longer.

24:14.706 --> 24:16.802
I can't sit for more than 15 minutes.

24:16.873 --> 24:19.474
I'm not happy about it, either. I
thought I'd heal faster than this.

24:19.499 --> 24:21.346
So we're staying? That's the best!

24:21.472 --> 24:23.984
I mean, not about you
being sick, obviously.

24:24.009 --> 24:25.204
Shall I let them out, Barbara?

24:25.229 --> 24:26.429
Yes, thanks, Greg.

24:35.514 --> 24:36.506
Well?

24:38.836 --> 24:40.718
- Uh, thanks, Greg.
- Thank you, Greg.

24:42.409 --> 24:44.405
Have you anything you
want to say, Bruce?

24:45.347 --> 24:47.646
I'm glad you're staying. See you around.

24:47.671 --> 24:48.951
Well, that sounds like a threat.

24:49.723 --> 24:51.091
How does it look when an estate agent

24:51.116 --> 24:52.932
can't even deal with a
dispute over a cubby house

24:52.957 --> 24:53.965
without getting arrested?

24:53.990 --> 24:56.697
Um, yes, well, we
spellchecked the rental ads.

24:57.858 --> 24:59.823
Hey, when can I come and see my dog?

24:59.848 --> 25:02.808
- What?
- Uh, we have a dog now.

25:12.851 --> 25:15.223
Em and I are gonna go door to
door offering free appraisals.

25:15.248 --> 25:18.104
Do you know what you
are? Human junk mail.

25:18.129 --> 25:20.057
Em, I'm at the radio station,
we're going on soon. Where are you?

25:20.082 --> 25:21.634
I think Daniel sounds like a legend

25:21.659 --> 25:23.322
and I would love to get
an appraisal from him.

25:23.347 --> 25:24.536
- Emma?
- No! Whoo!

25:24.561 --> 25:27.056
Would you like to kiss... now?

25:27.081 --> 25:29.058
Are you asking me rather than leaning in

25:29.083 --> 25:31.054
because of what happened last time?

25:39.940 --> 25:41.570
Thanks for getting Damien
to put a lock on it.

25:41.595 --> 25:42.740
No worries.

25:43.198 --> 25:45.213
- Can I tell you something?
- Yeah.

25:45.338 --> 25:48.007
- I hate it in here.
- Yeah, me too. It's so gross.
