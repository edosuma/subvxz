00:02.166 --> 00:03.000
Previously, on
"Below Deck Med"...

00:03.633 --> 00:05.000
My knee is so ----ed.

00:08.100 --> 00:09.200
Our chef injured himself.

00:09.233 --> 00:10.367
We are leaving him at the dock.

00:10.400 --> 00:12.300
-There will be no chef?
-No chef?

00:12.333 --> 00:13.500
We're ----ed.

00:16.400 --> 00:19.133
It sucks.

00:19.166 --> 00:21.266
Two mimosas,
a shot of Café Patron.

00:21.300 --> 00:23.500
-I want a shot as well.
-Two Café Patron.

00:23.533 --> 00:26.033
I'm, like, a pretty
laid-back Kiwi,

00:26.066 --> 00:28.100
but sometimes I turn into
a stressed-out bitch.

00:28.133 --> 00:29.600
So, you know, whatever,
I'm not perfect.

00:30.667 --> 00:32.100
Really?

00:32.133 --> 00:33.633
I accidentally set
a dessert spoon.

00:33.667 --> 00:36.367
-In future, we'll relay.
-Okay.

00:36.400 --> 00:37.567
I just don't like it,
because they always use it

00:37.600 --> 00:39.367
for something else.

00:39.400 --> 00:42.500
I have a love-hate relationship
with chief stewardess.

00:42.533 --> 00:44.133
Is that jet ski
tied onto something?

00:44.166 --> 00:45.600
I don't think it is.

00:45.633 --> 00:46.633
Ugh!

00:46.667 --> 00:49.133
Ah,

00:49.166 --> 00:51.400
I'd love to come back
and start fresh.

00:51.433 --> 00:53.600
When someone comes to me
with an injury,

00:53.633 --> 00:56.166
I cannot determine whether
they're injured or not.

00:56.200 --> 00:57.233
I have to follow protocol.

00:59.367 --> 01:01.533
-Hey!
-Introduce our chef.

01:01.567 --> 01:03.400
I am so sorry for
the start of this trip.

01:03.433 --> 01:05.633
-It's freezing.
-Ah!

01:09.300 --> 01:10.533
Woo!

01:10.567 --> 01:12.166
Crème brûlée!

01:14.500 --> 01:16.166
Chill the out.

01:16.200 --> 01:17.433
You are drunk as sh--,
look at you.

01:18.700 --> 01:20.233
Good, I don't wanna marry you.

01:20.266 --> 01:21.467
I'm going to tell
them right now.

01:45.333 --> 01:47.700
Good, I don't wanna marry you.

01:47.734 --> 01:49.433
I'm done, I'm not
marrying you.

01:49.467 --> 01:51.200
I'm going to tell them
right now.

01:57.600 --> 01:59.533
Lexi, Lexi, are you
in the main salon?

01:59.567 --> 02:01.233
Yes, I'm in the main salon.

02:03.400 --> 02:05.400
Are there guests
down there?

02:05.433 --> 02:07.600
They're in the master.
I don't know what's going on.

02:07.633 --> 02:10.333
I don't know, I don't know!

02:10.367 --> 02:13.400
They're, like, running up
and down, in between cabins.

02:13.433 --> 02:15.600
Are they having,
like, group sex?

02:18.433 --> 02:19.433
Like, that's what
I think that is.

02:19.467 --> 02:20.433
That's my kinda party.

02:26.433 --> 02:29.100
Hopefully, tomorrow goes well.

02:29.133 --> 02:31.100
Yeah, that's gonna be
a sh---show.

02:31.133 --> 02:32.433
-Good night, lady.
-Good night.

02:32.467 --> 02:34.367
All crew, that is
Malia down for the night.

02:34.400 --> 02:35.667
Sweet dreams, thank you
for everything.

02:35.700 --> 02:37.166
My pleasure.

02:37.200 --> 02:38.467
Have the best night ever.

02:38.500 --> 02:39.734
I'm gonna go down so I can
get up early.

02:39.767 --> 02:41.333
Yeah, yeah.

03:08.467 --> 03:09.600
Do you know what
the game plan is today?

03:09.633 --> 03:11.200
Not entirely.

03:13.633 --> 03:15.200
-Morning.
-Morning!

03:15.233 --> 03:16.333
Nice job in laundry, by the way.

03:16.367 --> 03:18.567
-It's looking good.
-Thanks!

03:18.600 --> 03:20.767
On the last boat, I didn't
really do much guest time

03:21.000 --> 03:23.166
because it was, like,
I was quite new on that anyway,

03:23.200 --> 03:24.166
so it was more housekeeping.

03:24.200 --> 03:25.600
But I wanna be in service,

03:25.633 --> 03:28.533
because that is definitely not
a social job down there.

03:34.433 --> 03:36.734
They went in their cabins,
they were fighting,

03:36.767 --> 03:38.500
the couple that's
gonna get married today,

03:38.533 --> 03:41.700
so, see if their
plans are still on.

03:44.633 --> 03:46.667
But that's when the
fighting's supposed to start.

03:46.700 --> 03:48.700
Very optimistic approach.

03:48.734 --> 03:52.233
Yeah, sorry, I'm not the
biggest fan of relationships.

03:53.500 --> 03:54.700
Do I need to change that?

03:56.633 --> 03:58.166
Oh.

04:00.700 --> 04:02.166
Stunning.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.400
Courtney's stunning, yeah.

04:04.433 --> 04:06.533
Yeah.

04:06.567 --> 04:07.700
How are you?

04:10.266 --> 04:11.467
-What's up?
-What's up?

04:11.500 --> 04:13.433
What's up?

04:13.467 --> 04:14.700
Another day in paradise.

04:14.734 --> 04:16.567
-The big day!
-That's right, the day.

04:16.600 --> 04:18.767
That was an interesting night.

04:24.734 --> 04:25.734
Oh.

04:27.767 --> 04:29.467
What's the vibe?

04:29.500 --> 04:30.600
It's kind of awkward
when you go out there.

04:30.633 --> 04:32.567
But we can start
going with stuff.

04:32.600 --> 04:33.734
Okay.

04:35.033 --> 04:37.233
I remember my--

04:37.266 --> 04:40.233
We've got crepes with
nectarine and cream.

04:40.266 --> 04:41.633
What's happening out there,
you've been doing vibe checks?

04:41.667 --> 04:43.033
Vibe check!

04:43.066 --> 04:44.333
Eggs Benedict with ham.

04:44.367 --> 04:45.433
Pretty excited about this.

04:45.467 --> 04:46.533
Holy Chihuahua.

04:46.567 --> 04:48.066
Clint, what should we do today?

04:48.100 --> 04:49.400
You guys should, like,
get married today.

04:49.433 --> 04:50.667
Before the...

04:50.700 --> 04:51.767
There she is.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.233
Hey, bud.

04:54.266 --> 04:56.734
Yes, babe, that will
give you life.

05:01.300 --> 05:04.000
Ready for today?

05:04.033 --> 05:05.600
-Yeah.
-Well...

05:05.633 --> 05:08.000
This is a pretty awkward moment.

05:08.033 --> 05:10.600
Obviously, I'm aware they had
an argument the night before

05:10.633 --> 05:12.500
and they're meant
to get married today.

05:12.533 --> 05:14.333
So, I need to cut the bullsh--

05:14.367 --> 05:17.700
and figure out
am I planning a wedding or not.

05:17.734 --> 05:21.567
You guys wanna go over
the plan for today?

05:21.600 --> 05:23.400
As long as
these two tie the knot,

05:23.433 --> 05:25.233
everything else
will be good.

05:25.266 --> 05:26.333
Well, we'll... we'll try,
like, a sunset ceremony?

05:26.367 --> 05:27.400
-Perfect.
-Okay.

05:27.433 --> 05:28.767
It's gonna be a great day.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.767
I was kinda hoping
I wouldn't have to do it,

05:32.000 --> 05:35.066
but love conquers all, right?

05:35.100 --> 05:36.533
Right?

05:38.100 --> 05:39.367
We have a delivery arriving.

05:39.400 --> 05:40.567
Ooh, where is it?

05:40.600 --> 05:41.734
Sh--.
Is that a cake?

05:41.767 --> 05:43.000
-Got it.
-Oh, my God.

05:43.033 --> 05:44.500
-Okay, you have it?
-Yeah.

05:44.533 --> 05:45.500
-Or you want me to take it?
-I've got it.

05:45.533 --> 05:47.100
-Okay.
-Whoa!

05:47.133 --> 05:48.767
Z...

05:49.000 --> 05:50.266
Honestly...

05:53.467 --> 05:54.734
Okay, here.

05:56.133 --> 05:57.767
This is the wedding cake.

06:01.066 --> 06:02.667
I've got a wedding cake.

06:02.700 --> 06:04.600
All right, can someone bring
it down to the walk-in, please?

06:04.633 --> 06:07.567
On my first full day waking up
with guests on the boat,

06:07.600 --> 06:10.033
it's an intense amount
of work I have.

06:10.066 --> 06:12.400
At least I get
to order the cake,

06:12.433 --> 06:15.433
but it makes
me feel very anxious.

06:15.467 --> 06:16.633
Ah!

06:20.734 --> 06:22.133
So, yeah, ceremony bit;

06:22.166 --> 06:23.734
also, canapés maybe
around 5:00-ish,

06:23.767 --> 06:27.000
and then I'm guessing dinner
around 8:00, 9:00, okay?

06:27.033 --> 06:29.533
I was gonna do, like,
a course-out dinner

06:29.567 --> 06:31.567
with, like, a scallop course,
a lamb...

06:31.600 --> 06:33.000
Oh, that's perfect, because
it's, like, a wedding, you know?

06:33.033 --> 06:34.000
-All right, yeah.
-Okay.

06:34.033 --> 06:35.433
Thank you.

06:37.500 --> 06:39.000
Woo-hoo!

06:39.033 --> 06:40.567
Whoa!

06:40.600 --> 06:42.700
-Beautiful.
-Five minutes till anchor's up.

06:42.734 --> 06:44.633
-Yeah, that's it.
-Closing up the platform.

06:46.433 --> 06:48.367
Okay, you can haul the anchor.

06:48.400 --> 06:51.000
Anchor is off the bottom,
approaching the waterline.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
-Anchor's home.
-Thank you.

06:56.033 --> 06:58.667
So, this is 25 knots of wind.

06:58.700 --> 07:00.133
I don't like it.

07:00.166 --> 07:01.700
Hey!

07:01.734 --> 07:03.467
Yo, the vibers!

07:03.500 --> 07:05.367
-How's it going?
-The ultimate cuzzies.

07:05.400 --> 07:06.600
Morning, morning, morning.

07:11.400 --> 07:12.467
♪ Said there's too many men,
too many, many men, ♪

07:12.500 --> 07:13.667
♪ too many men, too many men ♪

07:18.533 --> 07:20.667
Ooh, choppy.

07:23.600 --> 07:25.033
Lieutenant Dan, yeah!

07:25.066 --> 07:27.433
You ain't got no legs!

07:27.467 --> 07:30.100
Interior, chef department,
we're gonna feel it.

07:30.133 --> 07:31.734
Ooh, yeah, baby.

07:31.767 --> 07:33.100
Copy.

07:36.567 --> 07:38.033
My cake!

07:40.166 --> 07:41.367
Oh, God.

07:42.767 --> 07:44.400
Yeah, I'm not bringing
you ----ing drinks

07:44.433 --> 07:46.066
while it's like this.

07:46.100 --> 07:48.066
Ooh, look at that.

07:48.100 --> 07:50.400
They're rolling, there's some
----ing waves right here.

07:52.166 --> 07:53.500
That is rolling.

07:57.166 --> 07:59.000
Are you ready for
this wedding day?

07:59.033 --> 08:02.133
Oh, my God, as ready as you
can be to do a wedding alone.

08:04.133 --> 08:05.400
When you think "wedding,"

08:05.433 --> 08:08.734
you think, like,
elaborate, and...

08:08.767 --> 08:10.667
it's a lot of pressure
when you're responsible

08:10.700 --> 08:13.033
for everything
all on your own.

08:13.066 --> 08:15.066
On a yacht, people have
high expectations,

08:15.100 --> 08:17.700
and this is my redemption meal.

08:17.734 --> 08:20.100
I picked the wrong day
to come back.

08:20.133 --> 08:22.767
Malia, Katie, if you're free,
can you just pop in the bridge?

08:23.000 --> 08:24.200
-Copy.
-Copy.

08:26.133 --> 08:27.567
Right, I have news.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.700
Unfortunately for us,
the weather has ended

08:29.734 --> 08:32.633
our shore experience,
and the fireworks.

08:32.667 --> 08:35.000
That totally sucks for us
and the client,

08:35.033 --> 08:36.633
but we have to do it
on the boat.

08:36.667 --> 08:38.500
Main deck is, like,
the most protected.

08:38.533 --> 08:40.433
-Yeah, we'll get the archway...
-Yeah.

08:40.467 --> 08:42.400
And then just make
it really pretty.

08:42.433 --> 08:43.767
-Take us two hours to set up.
-Yeah.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.400
Gives me time to practice.

08:45.433 --> 08:46.700
I just read it over,
it's pretty good.

08:46.734 --> 08:48.567
Oh!

08:48.600 --> 08:50.200
I am so nervous that I have
to officiate this wedding.

08:50.233 --> 08:51.767
I've never done it before.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.767
I do a lot of public speaking,
but this is, like...

08:55.000 --> 08:57.100
like, honestly,
my palms are sweating.

08:57.133 --> 08:58.600
We'll do a light setup,

08:58.633 --> 09:00.533
but we'll mostly be
hands-on for you guys.

09:00.567 --> 09:02.533
Yeah, please.

09:02.567 --> 09:03.567
-Okay.
-Thank you.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.033
Thanks.

09:05.066 --> 09:06.500
All right,
let's do this, guys, woo!

09:06.533 --> 09:07.700
First wedding.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.233
Yeah.

09:14.033 --> 09:15.667
I know, I have some
towels for you.

09:15.700 --> 09:18.500
-Ah!
-Oh my God.

09:18.533 --> 09:22.767
-Malia, drop the anchor.
-Copy, dropping anchor.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.767
Can someone stand up...
stand by?

09:25.000 --> 09:27.133
Yeah.

09:27.166 --> 09:28.667
-Someone stand by to watch.
-Yeah.

09:28.700 --> 09:31.166
I actually like having
someone that's green,

09:31.200 --> 09:33.600
because you get
to help teach them,

09:33.633 --> 09:36.600
and that can be fun,
when you have the time.

09:36.633 --> 09:39.133
Just walk it out, yeah?
A little more.

09:39.166 --> 09:42.033
So, you're watching
which direction it's facing.

09:42.066 --> 09:43.567
Long stay, 11:00.

09:45.200 --> 09:48.600
I've just spoken to
Captain Sandy, and it's...

09:48.633 --> 09:50.567
It's gonna have to be down here.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.700
I'm meant to always
say "yes" at my job,

09:52.734 --> 09:54.767
but this time,
I have to say no.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.500
Well, then we're just
gonna take deep breaths,

09:56.533 --> 09:58.100
and that'll be cool.

09:59.567 --> 10:00.700
Let's bash this out.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.133
I mean, this also looks
horrible.

10:02.166 --> 10:03.533
I know.

10:05.066 --> 10:06.467
I think you're just
looking at it wrong.

10:09.600 --> 10:10.767
How long have
you guys been single?

10:11.000 --> 10:12.166
A year and a half.

10:12.200 --> 10:13.734
Basically my whole life.

10:13.767 --> 10:15.700
I tried the relationship
on a boat,

10:15.734 --> 10:17.133
and that was
a ----ing nightmare.

10:17.166 --> 10:18.633
Why didn't you guys like it?

10:18.667 --> 10:20.567
She dumped me mid-season.

10:20.600 --> 10:21.700
With someone else on the boat?

10:21.734 --> 10:22.734
While you were
on the same boat?

10:22.767 --> 10:24.266
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God.

10:24.300 --> 10:26.300
So I did, like,
two, three months on board

10:26.333 --> 10:28.200
with him and her.

10:28.233 --> 10:30.200
So, I think probably what is
a long-running issue

10:30.233 --> 10:32.500
is that nice guys
finish last thing,

10:32.533 --> 10:36.066
with my work life, with personal
life, with all this sh--.

10:36.100 --> 10:38.133
My girlfriend said that
I was "too nice,"

10:38.166 --> 10:41.033
and she felt like she could do
anything and get away with it,

10:41.066 --> 10:43.500
so she cheated on
me and was, like,

10:43.533 --> 10:45.166
"But you still wanna
be with me, right?"

10:45.200 --> 10:48.000
And I was like,
"Obviously ----ing not."

10:48.033 --> 10:49.333
-That's rude.
-Damn.

10:49.367 --> 10:50.734
Yeah.
I thought I had it bad.

10:50.767 --> 10:53.066
Ah, so gorgeous!

10:53.100 --> 10:55.200
Interior, interior,
we're handing up an arch,

10:55.233 --> 10:56.200
will you...
one of you run up.

10:56.233 --> 10:57.500
Okay.

10:57.533 --> 10:59.600
And two of us will
hand it back up.

10:59.633 --> 11:01.300
Oh, yeah, look at us go.

11:01.333 --> 11:04.100
Holy sh--, it's almost 3:00.

11:06.633 --> 11:08.567
-Appreciate you, man.
-Appreciate you, too.

11:08.600 --> 11:10.033
When I was at university,

11:10.066 --> 11:11.333
I really wanted to be
a wedding planner.

11:11.367 --> 11:13.367
-Really?
-I studied event management,

11:13.400 --> 11:15.266
and I always thought about
going into weddings,

11:15.300 --> 11:19.100
which is weird, because I don't
really wanna get married myself.

11:19.133 --> 11:21.266
But with Jack,
we were so in love,

11:21.300 --> 11:24.100
like, you know, I really
thought I'd met my soulmate.

11:24.133 --> 11:26.233
But I'm kinda glad
we didn't get married,

11:26.266 --> 11:30.166
because as much as I love Jack,
he can be a ----ing nightmare.

11:30.200 --> 11:31.734
He just got my face on his arm,

11:31.767 --> 11:33.100
so it's the same thing,
pretty much.

11:33.133 --> 11:35.100
It's a bigger commitment.

11:35.133 --> 11:40.166
Who knew you would be a
wedding coordinator/bartender?

11:40.200 --> 11:41.767
Stewardess.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.300
What's happening?

11:43.333 --> 11:44.734
Am I doing hors
d'oeuvres ashore, or on board?

11:45.000 --> 11:46.200
What made you think
they were going ashore?

11:46.233 --> 11:47.667
That was the original plan.

11:47.700 --> 11:50.600
You're preparing food on board.

11:50.633 --> 11:51.667
-You hear me?
-No.

11:51.700 --> 11:53.367
Should I put stones?

11:53.400 --> 11:55.667
Sprinkling it from about here
to take away from the thinness.

11:55.700 --> 11:57.734
Look at you, little stewardess!

12:01.100 --> 12:03.300
Oh, my God, I love them!

12:05.400 --> 12:07.033
Yeah, that looks
way better, hey?

12:07.066 --> 12:08.333
-Yeah.
-So, that's ready.

12:08.367 --> 12:11.200
We'll just do champagne
glasses for after.

12:11.233 --> 12:14.133
The plan is we're gonna
bring her out first.

12:14.166 --> 12:16.100
She wants to actually
walk up to him.

12:16.133 --> 12:18.000
Deck crew, let's get
changed into our blacks.

12:18.033 --> 12:19.266
Beautiful!

12:27.033 --> 12:28.166
Oh this.

12:28.200 --> 12:30.266
Karry and Clint,
you've expressed

12:30.300 --> 12:32.266
love to one another
through the commitment

12:32.300 --> 12:34.066
and promise you have just made.

12:38.200 --> 12:40.000
Do you have a couple
more bobby pins?

12:40.033 --> 12:41.000
-I do.
-And we can do that, so...

12:41.033 --> 12:42.333
-Yes, yes, yes.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.633
Oh, this is beautiful.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.033
Life, life!

12:50.066 --> 12:52.133
It's just life.

12:52.166 --> 12:53.600
Look at this rainbow!

12:53.633 --> 12:54.600
Thank you, Lord!

12:54.633 --> 12:56.066
Woo!

12:58.734 --> 13:00.233
Clint, you may kiss your bride.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.333
Everybody get into place,
it's time.

13:06.467 --> 13:08.300
Walk up from down there.

13:10.367 --> 13:12.066
Do you wanna just
stay down there with her,

13:12.100 --> 13:13.433
and I'll radio you
when to send her up?

13:13.467 --> 13:15.066
-Yep.
-All right, boys.

13:15.100 --> 13:16.700
-This is the last shot.
-Time to blast off!

13:16.734 --> 13:18.200
Yeah.
Then from right here.

13:18.233 --> 13:20.100
Here's to Mr. and Mrs. Yoder.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.300
-For real, yeah, mister Yoder.
-Thank you, buddy, thank you.

13:22.333 --> 13:23.300
-Guys.
-Yes?

13:23.333 --> 13:24.734
Showtime, baby.

13:24.767 --> 13:26.333
-All right, let's do it!
-Let's do it!

13:26.367 --> 13:27.767
Follow me.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.367
I've never sweated
so much in my life.

13:37.500 --> 13:40.233
I like to woo them with my
goofiness, but that takes weeks.

13:40.266 --> 13:42.266
Months.

13:42.300 --> 13:44.000
Sometimes years.

13:44.033 --> 13:48.467
A 29-year-old guy,
great with kids, love dogs,

13:48.500 --> 13:51.233
just looking for someone who's
not gonna be a major hassle.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.166
I don't wanna get
married anywhere.

13:56.467 --> 13:58.667
-The girls are already standing.
-All right.

13:58.700 --> 14:02.200
I honestly don't know
how we have made this happen.

14:02.233 --> 14:04.667
Like, the bride and groom
are arguing,

14:04.700 --> 14:06.233
it's ----ing sh--ty weather.

14:06.266 --> 14:09.266
I mean, legend for pulling
it off, but gobsmacked.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.333
-Ah!
-Oh, no!

14:12.367 --> 14:13.367
Oh, are you okay, Katie?

14:13.400 --> 14:15.400
hold that, hold, hold.

14:15.433 --> 14:17.066
Coming up...

14:17.100 --> 14:18.300
Can you please not
step in that?

14:18.333 --> 14:19.500
I just swept.

14:19.533 --> 14:20.500
Focus on putting
the lamb on the plate.

14:20.533 --> 14:22.233
Thank you.

14:22.266 --> 14:23.300
You can't talk to me
like you're the boss.

14:23.333 --> 14:24.367
Never again.
Never again.

14:24.400 --> 14:25.667
Get out.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.033
This is it,
we're about to blast off.

14:36.100 --> 14:37.734
-Ah!
-Oh, no!

14:37.767 --> 14:39.166
-You okay, sweetie?
-You okay, Katie?

14:39.200 --> 14:40.266
-Are you okay, Katie?
-Are you okay?

14:40.300 --> 14:41.533
I'm fine, I'm fine, yeah.

14:41.567 --> 14:42.533
-Okay.
-What was that?

14:42.567 --> 14:45.166
Just breaking myself.

14:45.200 --> 14:47.500
So embarrassing.

14:47.533 --> 14:49.467
Anyway, let's get married.

14:49.500 --> 14:51.300
So, then we'll have you...

14:51.333 --> 14:53.266
Goddamn!

14:53.300 --> 14:54.433
-Ooh!
-And you look amazing.

14:54.467 --> 14:55.734
Thank you.

14:57.367 --> 14:59.000
Thank you.

15:15.166 --> 15:16.300
Okay, send her up.

15:21.433 --> 15:23.567
Woo!

15:23.600 --> 15:26.367
Oh, my goodness!

15:32.467 --> 15:33.467
Thank you.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.166
So, I have to confess...

15:35.200 --> 15:36.767
this is my first time
I've ever done this.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.467
And the cool thing,

15:38.500 --> 15:40.266
it's the first time you've
ever done this, right?

15:40.300 --> 15:41.333
That's right.

15:41.367 --> 15:42.333
So, we're all in the same boat.

15:42.367 --> 15:44.066
-Love it.
-Yeah.

15:44.100 --> 15:46.233
We're all here today
in the beautiful country

15:46.266 --> 15:49.266
of Croatia to celebrate
the relationship

15:49.300 --> 15:50.767
of Karry and Clint.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.567
Clint, will you take Karry

15:52.600 --> 15:55.567
to be your lawfully
wedded wife?

15:55.600 --> 15:57.500
I will.

15:57.533 --> 16:01.467
Karry, will you take Clint to
be your lawfully wedded husband?

16:01.500 --> 16:03.233
I do.

16:03.266 --> 16:06.266
Karry and Clint, I pronounce
you husband and wife.

16:06.300 --> 16:07.633
You may kiss the bride.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.433
Woo!

16:09.467 --> 16:12.233
Mr. and Mrs. Clint
and Karry Yoder.

16:15.533 --> 16:17.367
Oh, yes!

16:17.400 --> 16:18.567
Ah.

16:20.400 --> 16:24.600
-Yay!
-Woo!

16:24.633 --> 16:26.433
Okay, start pulling.

16:26.467 --> 16:27.600
We're supposed to be
running canapés.

16:27.633 --> 16:29.233
Oh, okay.

16:29.266 --> 16:30.433
That's vegan
blue cheese pinwheels

16:30.467 --> 16:32.367
with honey and Thai basil.

16:32.400 --> 16:33.633
Awesome.

16:33.667 --> 16:36.333
Sesame tuna, wasabi mayo.

16:36.367 --> 16:37.567
Anyone hungry?

16:37.600 --> 16:39.533
This is the best day ever.

16:39.567 --> 16:41.600
Artichoke hearts, and a
big congratulations to you.

16:41.633 --> 16:43.133
-Aw!
-Thank you, man, thank you.

16:43.166 --> 16:44.133
Congratulations.

16:44.166 --> 16:45.400
Yeah.

16:45.433 --> 16:47.333
Wow, look at this rainbow!

16:47.367 --> 16:48.367
I know!

16:53.133 --> 16:55.367
Let's do flowers in the middle.

16:55.400 --> 16:57.133
Okay, do you wanna focus on deco

16:57.166 --> 16:58.433
and I just put
all the glassware down?

16:58.467 --> 17:00.400
Sure.

17:02.433 --> 17:05.100
See you on the flipside.

17:05.133 --> 17:07.133
Follow the crowd.

17:07.166 --> 17:09.066
Your first wedding.

17:09.100 --> 17:10.066
Maybe you'll do mine someday.

17:10.100 --> 17:11.266
You're getting married?

17:11.300 --> 17:12.400
Only if I find
two girls somewhere.

17:12.433 --> 17:13.533
I wanna truple.

17:16.367 --> 17:17.633
That's funny.

17:17.667 --> 17:20.300
I mean, to me,
non-monogamy's normal.

17:20.333 --> 17:21.567
I'm a sharebear.

17:21.600 --> 17:23.300
Everyone has their goals.

17:26.600 --> 17:28.200
Yeah!

17:29.233 --> 17:30.333
Woo!

17:30.367 --> 17:31.467
Did you all see the rainbow?

17:31.500 --> 17:33.166
-Yes, yes!
-Oh, my gosh!

17:33.200 --> 17:35.433
A psychic told my mother

17:35.467 --> 17:39.433
that my grandfather would show
up at the wedding as a rainbow.

17:39.467 --> 17:44.200
Stop, that makes
me wanna cry, oh!

17:44.233 --> 17:46.467
When my grandfather passed away,

17:46.500 --> 17:48.500
there was this moth
that was in the room

17:48.533 --> 17:50.533
that I'd always stay in when
I slept at their house.

17:50.567 --> 17:52.600
Ever since,
if I'm going through, like,

17:52.633 --> 17:54.667
a difficult time
or my anxiety's really bad,

17:54.700 --> 17:56.600
a moth will always,
like, fly past me.

17:56.633 --> 17:58.300
And I don't know,
it's just, like, a weird...

17:58.333 --> 18:00.300
I'm, like, believe in
stuff like that.

18:00.333 --> 18:03.200
The most prominent rainbow
I've ever seen in my life.

18:03.233 --> 18:05.100
-We had your grandfather.
-As a rainbow.

18:06.667 --> 18:07.700
Hello?

18:18.667 --> 18:21.133
It's definitely weird
to talk to him, you know?

18:21.166 --> 18:22.700
It's very raw at this point.

18:22.734 --> 18:26.266
Hi, you!

18:26.300 --> 18:28.200
Like, I wanna still talk to
him like I normally do,

18:28.233 --> 18:29.700
but I'm, like, God,
I ----ing hate you.

18:31.400 --> 18:33.300
There's plenty of fish
in the sea...

18:33.333 --> 18:35.333
ones that don't sleep
with other fishies.

18:36.333 --> 18:37.333
I can't talk.

18:37.367 --> 18:38.633
Bye.

18:42.266 --> 18:44.333
Very nice.

18:44.367 --> 18:46.133
Feeling getting your
feet under you, aren't you?

18:46.166 --> 18:48.133
-Yeah.
-I can tell.

18:49.333 --> 18:51.233
-Um...
-What?

18:51.266 --> 18:53.667
Water glass always
goes on top of main knife,

18:53.700 --> 18:56.133
and then you do a triangle.
That's just the...

18:56.166 --> 18:57.300
It's so weird,
because each chief stew

18:57.333 --> 18:58.467
always says something different.

18:58.500 --> 19:00.233
-Really?
-Yes.

19:00.266 --> 19:03.133
It's supposed to be water
on the side at an angle,

19:03.166 --> 19:05.233
and then white wine
is angled by the water,

19:05.266 --> 19:06.600
and the red wine is...

19:06.633 --> 19:09.233
Water glass should always be
on top of the main.

19:09.266 --> 19:10.700
Okay.

19:10.734 --> 19:12.433
I totally get
where Lexi's coming from.

19:12.467 --> 19:14.166
Right now, there's just
so much going on,

19:14.200 --> 19:15.433
I just don't want
sh-- from anyone.

19:15.467 --> 19:17.333
Like, who, like,
enjoys conflict?

19:17.367 --> 19:20.233
I ----ing hate it.
But, oh, whatever.

19:20.266 --> 19:21.533
-Okay.
-Okay.

19:22.600 --> 19:24.233
Hey, man.

19:24.266 --> 19:25.767
Ah, yeah.

19:28.633 --> 19:30.400
Hey, Lexi, you wanna
go eat something

19:30.433 --> 19:31.767
and sit down for,
like, 10 minutes?

19:32.000 --> 19:34.734
Can you take Corona
and an espresso coffee shot,

19:34.767 --> 19:36.467
and then I'll go eat.

19:36.500 --> 19:39.333
The espresso is for the bride;
Corona is husband.

19:41.200 --> 19:42.233
No, you two just go.

19:45.667 --> 19:47.367
Oh, yeah.

19:47.400 --> 19:48.700
I don't even think
Katie's sat down once.

19:48.734 --> 19:51.233
It's hard
to step away as a leader.

19:51.266 --> 19:53.300
You know, I want the girls
to have more rest.

19:53.333 --> 19:54.533
My knee are burning.

19:56.266 --> 19:59.433
Like, I'm happy to
sacrifice... breaks.

20:03.533 --> 20:04.667
I don't wanna hear about it!

20:06.600 --> 20:09.467
Ooh [bleep]! No!

20:10.734 --> 20:13.266
----ing stupid ----ing idiot.

20:15.266 --> 20:18.567
I dropped the wedding cake.
my life.

20:18.600 --> 20:21.367
That is a ----ing disaster.

20:21.400 --> 20:23.767
It's not that bad.
This should be the front facing,

20:24.000 --> 20:25.667
and then we can cover all this.

20:25.700 --> 20:28.500
-Somebody call the bride?
-Yeah!

20:28.533 --> 20:30.266
The first course is a scallop,

20:30.300 --> 20:31.467
so I wanna make
sure they're seated and,

20:31.500 --> 20:32.667
like, so I don't overcook it.

20:32.700 --> 20:34.333
The scallop... let me...
let me--

20:34.367 --> 20:35.700
Yeah, so just tell her
when she's, like,

20:35.734 --> 20:36.734
for sure they're,
like, three minutes away,

20:36.767 --> 20:37.734
I'll fire the scallops.

20:37.767 --> 20:39.567
-Okay, awesome.
-Thanks.

20:44.567 --> 20:47.467
Whenever you guys are
seated, like, we can go.

20:47.500 --> 20:48.767
-Start serving?
-Okay, cool.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.600
-Yeah.
-Sweet, let's sit down, yeah.

20:50.633 --> 20:52.233
Five minutes, or...

20:55.700 --> 20:56.767
Excuse me!

20:59.533 --> 21:00.633
Interior, interior, galley.

21:03.367 --> 21:06.600
Whoa, easy, tiger,
not everyone's at the table.

21:06.633 --> 21:08.600
Sorry?

21:08.633 --> 21:10.500
Whenever y'all are ready,
we're gonna eat some dinner.

21:10.533 --> 21:12.600
----ing kidding me.

21:19.000 --> 21:19.467
Interior, interior, galley.

21:22.533 --> 21:26.033
Whoa, easy, tiger,
not everyone's at the table.

21:26.066 --> 21:27.767
Sorry?

21:28.000 --> 21:29.633
Whenever y'all are ready,
we're gonna eat some dinner.

21:31.100 --> 21:33.533
Baby, I'll be there
in five seconds.

21:33.567 --> 21:35.000
----ing kidding me.

21:35.033 --> 21:37.500
Now I'm a ----ing...

21:37.533 --> 21:40.400
We have a really small weather
window to get into the dock,

21:40.433 --> 21:42.033
and then because
it's really windy,

21:42.066 --> 21:43.600
we'll get all lines secured

21:43.633 --> 21:45.533
and then we'll worry about
ground lines, cool?

21:45.567 --> 21:47.000
Copy.

21:48.433 --> 21:49.400
Always do comms with me.

21:49.433 --> 21:50.400
-I know.
-Because I know.

21:50.433 --> 21:51.767
I'll...

21:52.000 --> 21:53.100
Well, she said you guys were
doing water, wine, fire.

21:53.133 --> 21:54.700
Ooh!

21:54.734 --> 21:56.433
Yep.

21:56.467 --> 21:58.300
Hey, don't tell the galley
that he's ready,

21:58.333 --> 22:00.033
because he was only
one minute to plate.

22:00.066 --> 22:02.300
I literally told him
I'm gonna do waters and wine.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.533
I just said in future,
we'll just always go through me.

22:06.567 --> 22:07.533
Yeah.

22:07.567 --> 22:09.100
Courtney, Courtney, Katie.

22:09.133 --> 22:11.767
Do you wanna come and be
on standby to drop some plates?

22:12.000 --> 22:13.467
Sure, yeah.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.033
One more guest we're waiting on.

22:15.066 --> 22:16.567
-You can't tell me to fire...
-Did you know...

22:16.600 --> 22:17.633
I know, but did you not hear
me when I said I was...

22:17.667 --> 22:19.367
had to pour waters and wines?

22:19.400 --> 22:21.333
Yeah, but you said
you were good to fire.

22:21.367 --> 22:22.400
It's no big deal,
but next time...

22:22.433 --> 22:23.700
Okay. Okay.
All righty.

22:23.734 --> 22:24.700
-Fire means fire.
-It's my... my problem.

22:24.734 --> 22:26.367
Yeah.

22:26.400 --> 22:27.400
I kinda find it difficult
when, like...

22:31.700 --> 22:33.533
That's not gonna fly with me.

22:33.567 --> 22:36.000
All right, Mat,
how about those appetizers?

22:36.033 --> 22:38.367
I'm not gonna cook any
first course

22:38.400 --> 22:40.467
until everyone's sitting
from now on, all right?

22:43.667 --> 22:45.033
----ing kidding me.

22:45.066 --> 22:46.700
That's beautiful.

22:46.734 --> 22:48.767
-Looks good in here.
-Yeah.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.133
-All right, Malia.
-Are you going down?

22:50.166 --> 22:51.433
I'm gonna try.

22:51.467 --> 22:53.000
Okay, copy.

22:53.033 --> 22:55.033
-Okay, good night.
-Good night.

22:55.066 --> 22:57.400
-Galley, we can go on food.
-Copy.

23:00.133 --> 23:02.000
-Local seared scallop...
-Yeah

23:02.033 --> 23:03.700
-On a celeriac puree?
-And...

23:03.734 --> 23:05.367
-Ooh, poppy!
-Truffle poppy!

23:08.166 --> 23:09.533
Yeah!

23:09.567 --> 23:11.734
For your first course tonight,

23:11.767 --> 23:15.467
we have a local seared
scallop on a celeriac puree,

23:15.500 --> 23:16.700
topped with truffle popcorn.

23:16.734 --> 23:19.433
Truffle popcorn?

23:19.467 --> 23:21.700
-What?
-That sounds delicious.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.633
Wow, that's the best...

23:23.667 --> 23:25.600
that's one of the best things
I've had this whole time.

23:25.633 --> 23:28.600
All right, so Captain Sandy's
down, so you're in charge.

23:29.600 --> 23:32.133
Yeah.

23:32.166 --> 23:33.166
It's all you.

23:35.500 --> 23:37.233
I think everything in general
just makes me

23:37.266 --> 23:38.233
a bit nervous at the moment.

23:38.266 --> 23:39.500
Do you want a photo in here?

23:39.533 --> 23:41.533
Yeah.

23:41.567 --> 23:42.667
Come on, then.

23:44.600 --> 23:46.567
Captain Z!

23:46.600 --> 23:48.033
And of course
I have my brothers,

23:48.066 --> 23:49.667
who are also in yachting,
just on standby.

23:55.700 --> 23:58.533
Just watch me, follow me,
we'll go down in the same line.

23:58.567 --> 24:00.567
Clean your pallet,
it's time to go to work.

24:04.633 --> 24:06.166
Malia, can you help us
take out...

24:06.200 --> 24:08.467
-Wait, wait, wait...
-I just need to put the lamb on.

24:08.500 --> 24:11.000
-Yeah, just need it.
-ASAP, as soon as...

24:11.033 --> 24:12.233
-Because they get up like kids.
-Yep...

24:12.266 --> 24:13.767
Yeah, I'm gonna pop it in.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
Lexi's bossing me around.
Like, who is this girl?

24:16.033 --> 24:18.100
I'm cooking a
----ing wedding meal.

24:18.133 --> 24:20.433
It's my redemption meal.
I will not be rushed.

24:20.467 --> 24:23.266
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:24.700 --> 24:26.033
They probably won't know
the difference

24:26.066 --> 24:27.600
between a lamb and
a cow right now.

24:29.266 --> 24:30.700
Oh, here it is!

24:30.734 --> 24:34.066
-Yes!
-Fresh out.

24:34.100 --> 24:36.533
Okay, for your main
course tonight,

24:36.567 --> 24:39.000
we have a rack of New Zealand
lamb on a ratatouille,

24:39.033 --> 24:41.000
a soft-cooked polenta
with parmesan,

24:41.033 --> 24:42.500
and a chocolate
and red wine sauce.

24:42.533 --> 24:44.734
-Thank you.
-Yum!

24:47.533 --> 24:50.133
Get this outta my face.

24:50.166 --> 24:51.233
-Like a non-lamb...
-Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:51.266 --> 24:52.633
Do you want the ratatouille?

24:52.667 --> 24:54.066
-Perfect.
-I can get him to replate that.

24:54.100 --> 24:55.166
If you do have
extra lamb, I'll...

24:55.200 --> 24:56.266
Yeah, cool, I'll go grab it.

24:56.300 --> 24:57.467
Terez...

24:57.500 --> 24:59.166
on her preference sheet,

24:59.200 --> 25:02.467
it didn't state that she
didn't eat any kind of pet.

25:02.500 --> 25:04.133
Tereza doesn't want lamb.

25:04.166 --> 25:05.667
Is there any extra,
like, ratatouille, or...

25:05.700 --> 25:08.233
Yeah.

25:08.266 --> 25:09.667
Just a really
thrown-together thing.

25:09.700 --> 25:11.700
No worries, she's just wasted.

25:11.734 --> 25:13.533
Lexi, can you call the galley

25:13.567 --> 25:15.000
and tell him to plate
some extra lamb?

25:15.033 --> 25:16.033
Yeah.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.567
There you go.

25:20.600 --> 25:22.500
You tell Mat that
the lamb was awesome.

25:22.533 --> 25:24.166
-Hey, just...
-Do you guys--

25:24.200 --> 25:25.567
I want a couple more lamb pops.

25:25.600 --> 25:28.233
Yeah.

25:28.266 --> 25:29.266
What?

25:29.300 --> 25:31.700
Plate some extra lamb, please.

25:31.734 --> 25:33.166
You mind grabbing me a platter?

25:33.200 --> 25:35.200
And watch that pile
I got there.

25:41.767 --> 25:44.033
Boom... you... you're stepping
right in my piles.

25:44.066 --> 25:45.533
Don't worry about
the ----ing dirt.

25:49.033 --> 25:51.567
Right now is not the time.

25:55.133 --> 25:57.133
Excuse me.

25:59.567 --> 26:01.000
Mm!

26:02.233 --> 26:03.600
I'm gonna ----ing snap.

26:03.633 --> 26:06.133
This is so barbaric.

26:06.166 --> 26:09.166
Can you please not step in that?
I just swept it there.

26:09.200 --> 26:11.266
It's literally too dirt...
don't worry about it.

26:11.300 --> 26:12.734
-But... but, like...
-I will sweep it up.

26:12.767 --> 26:15.100
Just focus on putting
the lamb on the plate.

26:15.133 --> 26:16.700
Thank you.

26:16.734 --> 26:18.200
You can't talk to me
like you're the boss.

26:18.233 --> 26:19.700
I'm in charge of the galley,
all right?

26:19.734 --> 26:20.700
-Never again.
-I know, but I'm saying...

26:20.734 --> 26:22.000
Never again.
Get out.

26:27.700 --> 26:30.000
Don't worry about
the ----ing dirt.

26:30.033 --> 26:32.700
Right now is not the time.

26:32.734 --> 26:34.767
Just go tell Mat
I want more lamb pops.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.266
Yeah, he's plating
some more lamb now.

26:36.300 --> 26:37.767
Nice.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.367
Just focus on putting
the lamb on the plate.

26:40.400 --> 26:43.033
No offense.
Thank you.

26:43.066 --> 26:44.333
You can't talk to me
like you're the boss.

26:44.367 --> 26:46.033
I'm in charge of the galley,
all right?

26:46.066 --> 26:47.033
-Never again.
-I know, but I'm saying...

26:47.066 --> 26:48.033
Never again.
Get out.

26:48.066 --> 26:49.100
Don't worry.

26:49.133 --> 26:50.567
Are you ----ing kidding me?

26:51.767 --> 26:53.166
Yes, absolutely.

26:55.734 --> 26:56.734
Would you like another
piece of lamb?

26:56.767 --> 26:59.133
Yeah, dude, I need more lamb.

26:59.166 --> 27:00.667
Are you finished?

27:00.700 --> 27:01.667
Would you like another
piece of lamb?

27:01.700 --> 27:03.266
I want a couple more of that.

27:03.300 --> 27:04.700
Don't worry, we'll have
some more for you.

27:04.734 --> 27:06.166
Yeah, just a couple more,
yeah, please.

27:06.200 --> 27:07.667
Chef, chef, we need
more lamb chops, please.

27:07.700 --> 27:10.100
I'm all out.

27:10.133 --> 27:13.066
Are you ----ing kidding me?
She just ate everything.

27:13.100 --> 27:16.667
You don't touch anything until
you're sure the guests are done.

27:16.700 --> 27:18.133
Such a ----ing idiot.

27:19.667 --> 27:21.166
That's cool.

27:21.200 --> 27:22.166
That's the best meat
I've ever had.

27:22.200 --> 27:23.367
I don't eat pets.

27:23.400 --> 27:25.066
Let's do rose petals
on the bed.

27:25.100 --> 27:26.400
-Okay.
-Is this VIP cabin?

27:26.433 --> 27:27.734
Yeah.

27:31.033 --> 27:32.166
Yeah.

27:32.200 --> 27:33.200
My back.

27:33.233 --> 27:34.700
I always do my knot first.

27:34.734 --> 27:36.066
Yeah.

27:36.100 --> 27:38.000
You have to be
really confident.

27:38.033 --> 27:39.266
I'd rather you knock someone out
than not make it to the dock.

27:39.300 --> 27:42.033
Z is so nervous for
his first docking,

27:42.066 --> 27:44.333
and I'm hoping
I can work with Z,

27:44.367 --> 27:46.000
knowing where he's coming from,

27:46.033 --> 27:48.066
because I remember
my first docking.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.400
Malia's helping me on this side.

27:49.433 --> 27:51.233
Uh, probably here, yeah...
or yeah, forward.

27:51.266 --> 27:52.700
It's nerve-wracking.

27:52.734 --> 27:54.200
Don't overthink it.

27:54.233 --> 27:55.233
Yeah.

27:57.367 --> 27:59.033
And I just wanna say,
like,

27:59.066 --> 28:02.000
how just thankful
and grateful I am.

28:02.033 --> 28:03.000
Oh!

28:03.033 --> 28:04.333
Come on, up we go.

28:06.066 --> 28:08.633
-Hey!
-Oh, my goodness!

28:08.667 --> 28:11.200
-Wow!
-Yeah, sorry, perfect.

28:11.233 --> 28:13.066
I didn't wanna be part
of the cake service,

28:13.100 --> 28:15.033
so I was dreading them asking
me and having to be, like,

28:15.066 --> 28:16.633
"No, I bought this."

28:16.667 --> 28:18.200
Even though that's fine.

28:18.233 --> 28:20.333
Like, I just did a ----ing
multi-course dinner.

28:20.367 --> 28:22.133
Like, whatever, I bought a cake.

28:22.166 --> 28:24.166
Mat, you are amazing.

28:27.066 --> 28:29.100
-If you wanna knock off...
-Yeah, that's cool.

28:29.133 --> 28:30.100
Was starting at 6:00 good
for you this morning?

28:30.133 --> 28:31.300
Yeah.

28:31.333 --> 28:33.233
Let's cut it all
the way down, ready?

28:33.266 --> 28:35.433
-Just shove that in there!
-No, no, no...

28:37.333 --> 28:38.333
Yeah!

28:39.734 --> 28:42.033
Yeah!

28:43.033 --> 28:44.300
Woo!

28:46.400 --> 28:47.467
There you go.

28:47.500 --> 28:48.467
Ooh!

28:48.500 --> 28:49.467
Oh, my God.

28:49.500 --> 28:51.266
Hey, it's all sprayable.

28:51.300 --> 28:53.233
How is shoving a cake
in someone's face romantic?

28:53.266 --> 28:54.667
I'd be so pissed,

28:54.700 --> 28:56.100
especially if it
was my wedding day

28:56.133 --> 28:57.500
and my makeup was looking bomb.

28:57.533 --> 29:00.033
I would be, like,
what the

29:00.066 --> 29:01.100
Why?

29:01.133 --> 29:03.300
Babe?

29:03.333 --> 29:05.133
It's all sprayable.

29:05.166 --> 29:07.667
Hey, I had...

29:07.700 --> 29:09.467
I had just swept in there...
into there...

29:09.500 --> 29:11.133
I...
Like, listen, listen.

29:11.166 --> 29:14.734
It's not that big of a deal,
but like,

29:14.767 --> 29:16.333
I try to be nice all the time,

29:16.367 --> 29:18.233
so if I ask you not to
step in a pile I just swept,

29:18.266 --> 29:19.233
there's no argument.

29:19.266 --> 29:20.266
I don't care.

29:20.300 --> 29:21.333
Listen...
There's...

29:21.367 --> 29:23.100
There's no argument.

29:23.133 --> 29:24.100
I get that you don't want
anyone in your dirt.

29:24.133 --> 29:25.433
I understand that.

29:25.467 --> 29:27.066
But don't tell me to
get out of somewhere,

29:27.100 --> 29:28.266
because I never tell you
to get out of our area.

29:28.300 --> 29:29.700
I won't say,
"Get out of the pantry."

29:29.734 --> 29:31.233
Listen, Lexi why was it an issue
not to stand

29:31.266 --> 29:33.734
in the pile that
I had just swept?

29:33.767 --> 29:35.133
I don't know, I'm tired.

29:35.166 --> 29:36.700
-Got it.
-So, I offered to clean it up.

29:36.734 --> 29:39.133
So, the little dirt is,
like, not a big deal.

29:39.166 --> 29:42.767
Okay, neat freak, I get it.

29:43.000 --> 29:47.400
I still can't believe he's,
like, still upset over dirt.

29:47.433 --> 29:49.133
All right, babe, thank you.

29:49.166 --> 29:50.166
-I'm going to bed.
-Going to bed?

29:50.200 --> 29:51.300
Caribbean queen.

29:51.333 --> 29:53.000
Have a good night's sleep.

29:54.533 --> 29:57.266
Oh, my gosh, cute.

29:59.400 --> 30:00.734
Sweet dreams.

30:04.333 --> 30:06.033
Ugh, Dave-O!

30:06.066 --> 30:08.033
That one wrecked.

30:08.066 --> 30:11.233
It's like eggs and sh--
mixed together!

30:23.400 --> 30:26.266
Bridge, bridge, we are headed
forward to the chain.

30:26.300 --> 30:27.333
Copy.

30:29.767 --> 30:32.066
Eleven o'clock, she'll stay.
Eleven o'clock, she'll stay.

30:32.100 --> 30:33.367
Thank you.

30:35.333 --> 30:36.367
Anchor in the pocket.

30:36.400 --> 30:38.033
Nice work, thank you.

30:38.066 --> 30:39.266
Nicely done!

30:44.166 --> 30:45.233
What up, G?

30:45.266 --> 30:46.467
Yeah, what up, G-money?

30:46.500 --> 30:48.200
These, technically,

30:48.233 --> 30:50.500
are your straight-backs,
and then these for your springs.

30:50.533 --> 30:52.166
This one will go directly aft.

30:52.200 --> 30:54.233
First time docking,
super nerve-wracking.

30:54.266 --> 30:55.567
Like, just thinking about it,

30:55.600 --> 30:57.300
like, I don't know
what to expect, really,

30:57.333 --> 30:59.200
because I actually
don't know what to do.

30:59.233 --> 31:01.400
And then we're gonna
get that second one on,

31:01.433 --> 31:03.066
and it'll go this way,
but shorter.

31:03.100 --> 31:04.567
-Hi.
-Oh, how are ya?

31:04.600 --> 31:05.567
Good...

31:05.600 --> 31:06.567
Wait for a cup of tea later?

31:06.600 --> 31:08.300
What's that?

31:08.333 --> 31:10.200
Oh, yeah, I would love
a cheeky little Earl Grey.

31:10.233 --> 31:12.500
With Katie, I'm just hoping the
British accent wins her over.

31:12.533 --> 31:14.200
Oh!

31:15.533 --> 31:16.500
All right, I'll see you
in a bit.

31:16.533 --> 31:17.633
Cheerio!

31:17.667 --> 31:20.033
Now the fun begins...

31:20.066 --> 31:22.033
Start getting fenders
ready, please.

31:27.500 --> 31:29.233
Could you just walk me
through putting the fenders on?

31:29.266 --> 31:30.533
Good morning!

31:30.567 --> 31:32.000
We got 15 minutes
till we're in, so...

31:32.033 --> 31:33.166
Okay.

31:33.200 --> 31:35.000
You wanna get ready
on the bow?

31:38.433 --> 31:40.266
Malia, Lloyd,
ready to go on the bow.

31:40.300 --> 31:41.266
-Under...
-Yeah.

31:41.300 --> 31:43.433
-Over...
-Over...

31:43.467 --> 31:45.533
-And back through.
-Fenders over, please.

31:49.533 --> 31:52.533
Hey, Malia, let me
know on the starboard...

31:52.567 --> 31:54.300
when I pass that dock,
I can back in.

31:54.333 --> 31:56.400
Copy, your port quarter
to the dock.

31:56.433 --> 31:59.467
Going into my first docking with
a new crew, I'm not worried.

31:59.500 --> 32:00.667
I have confidence in Malia.

32:00.700 --> 32:03.367
Fenders over, let's go!

32:03.400 --> 32:05.233
And yeah, the wind's
a little challenging,

32:05.266 --> 32:07.166
but this is a great test.

32:14.266 --> 32:15.500
Just pop it through there.

32:18.133 --> 32:20.600
You've got two dolphins
directly astern, 30 feet.

32:20.633 --> 32:22.200
Where I see the guy
in the tender,

32:22.233 --> 32:24.066
is that the dolphin
I'm going for?

32:24.100 --> 32:27.567
Yes, but we have one directly
astern, also about 25 feet.

32:27.600 --> 32:30.266
Captain Sandy not being able
to see the dolphin

32:30.300 --> 32:32.467
is a little worrisome, because

32:32.500 --> 32:35.200
they are giant concrete blocks.

32:35.233 --> 32:37.233
So obviously,
you don't wanna hit one.

32:37.266 --> 32:39.200
I can't see the dolphin
on my port side.

32:39.233 --> 32:40.467
Coming there, yeah.

32:40.500 --> 32:43.567
Bump ahead, 12 feet closing,
dolphin astern.

32:43.600 --> 32:45.700
Wind's really blowing.
You have to go.

32:45.734 --> 32:47.200
Eight feet and closing.

32:55.633 --> 32:56.266
I can't see it.

32:57.633 --> 32:59.600
Watch it on the stern on
this dolphin, please.

32:59.633 --> 33:02.400
Hold this position nicely,
if we can just come back.

33:02.433 --> 33:05.266
I can't see the dolphin
on my port side.

33:05.300 --> 33:06.700
Port dolphin three feet.

33:06.734 --> 33:08.467
Chrissakes.

33:08.500 --> 33:10.600
This position looks great
if we can just walk back.

33:10.633 --> 33:12.166
Look how close it is.

33:13.633 --> 33:15.100
Fenders.

33:15.133 --> 33:17.233
Easier said than done.

33:17.266 --> 33:18.600
Beautiful, okay.

33:23.300 --> 33:24.533
Fifteen feet stern and closing.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.400
Sending heaving lines.

33:35.300 --> 33:36.633
There we go!

33:36.667 --> 33:39.166
Let's get our other
lines across, please.

33:39.200 --> 33:41.633
Taking up tension off
our port straight back.

33:43.233 --> 33:45.467
Port bow line is
under tension now.

33:45.500 --> 33:47.633
Copy... Captain Sandy,
that is all lines across.

33:47.667 --> 33:49.633
We have control,
you're happy to shut down.

33:49.667 --> 33:51.200
Thank you.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.300
What, what!

33:54.333 --> 33:56.233
-Hey, nice work.
-Thanks.

33:56.266 --> 33:57.233
You did great.

33:57.266 --> 33:58.233
That was, like, a lot of wind.

33:58.266 --> 33:59.266
Yeah.

33:59.300 --> 34:00.367
That was not easy.

34:00.400 --> 34:01.567
-Good job, guys.
-Thank you.

34:01.600 --> 34:02.734
Yeah, they're all doing
really good.

34:02.767 --> 34:04.300
-You did great, though.
-Thank you.

34:05.567 --> 34:06.767
Good morning!

34:08.700 --> 34:10.734
-We ----ing made it.
-We ----ing made it.

34:10.767 --> 34:13.400
The knee problem's gone,
the attitude's there.

34:13.433 --> 34:14.633
I'm so happy!

34:14.667 --> 34:16.000
The guests are happy.

34:16.033 --> 34:17.400
I am not gonna jinx this.

34:17.433 --> 34:19.400
Hope I can do it six more times.

34:19.433 --> 34:22.667
Morning! I can't believe
we're docked.

34:22.700 --> 34:24.333
All crew, all crew,
please get into your whites.

34:24.367 --> 34:26.333
Show me the money,
show me the money.

34:30.467 --> 34:31.633
Oh, we're gonna
go start packing.

34:33.367 --> 34:35.166
Courtney, come pack for us!

34:37.600 --> 34:39.533
Are you impressed yet, Malia?

34:39.567 --> 34:40.600
I am impressed.

34:40.633 --> 34:42.467
You pushed through an injury,

34:42.500 --> 34:45.667
whether it be a psychological
injury or a physical one.

34:45.700 --> 34:47.266
I think it was a combinash.

34:48.367 --> 34:50.000
Hey, hey...

34:50.033 --> 34:51.000
Fresh.

34:51.033 --> 34:52.000
A compliment?

34:52.033 --> 34:53.700
Yeah, all right.

34:53.734 --> 34:55.300
Deck crew, we have
some luggage

34:55.333 --> 34:57.367
in the primary cabin
that is ready.

34:57.400 --> 34:58.433
We need to grab some luggage.

34:58.467 --> 34:59.633
Yeah, these two.

34:59.667 --> 35:01.200
You get a workout
in with that one.

35:02.700 --> 35:06.233
All crew, all crew, queue up
on the dock in your whites.

35:08.734 --> 35:10.367
Watch your step, babe.

35:11.734 --> 35:13.233
Oh, thank you guys!

35:13.266 --> 35:14.333
Enjoy the rest of the stay.

35:14.367 --> 35:17.400
Thank you, you're amazing.

35:17.433 --> 35:19.433
Enjoy the rest of Croatia!

35:19.467 --> 35:21.200
I just wanted to let
you guys know

35:21.233 --> 35:23.433
that we're in the
hospitality business.

35:25.266 --> 35:27.066
The food is
one of the things

35:27.100 --> 35:30.400
that we were looking forward
to the most.

35:30.433 --> 35:33.667
Ugh, here we go.

35:33.700 --> 35:36.500
And I know Mat, you did a
great job making that happen.

35:36.533 --> 35:37.767
Thank you so much.

35:38.000 --> 35:40.467
Katie, you had your
girls on point.

35:40.500 --> 35:42.467
Oh, thank you, yes!

35:42.500 --> 35:43.467
Amazing.

35:43.500 --> 35:44.767
So, this is for you all.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.066
You worked your
asses off for it.

35:46.100 --> 35:47.433
Thank you so much.

35:47.467 --> 35:48.533
-Bye, guys.
-Bye!

35:48.567 --> 35:50.233
-Thank you.
-Love y'all.

35:50.266 --> 35:51.533
Get in our reds,
and we'll meet in the main salon

35:51.567 --> 35:52.567
for our tip meeting.

35:54.633 --> 35:56.333
Oh, God, I don't know
what just happened.

35:56.367 --> 35:57.734
-I mean...
-Oh, money.

35:57.767 --> 35:59.266
Ooh!

35:59.300 --> 36:00.600
Dude, what a
great first charter!

36:00.633 --> 36:01.667
yeah.

36:01.700 --> 36:03.333
Oh!

36:03.367 --> 36:05.033
All crew, all crew,

36:05.066 --> 36:06.700
meet me in the main salon
for our tip meeting.

36:06.734 --> 36:09.000
Copy, on my way.

36:09.033 --> 36:10.533
-Z...
-Z, catch me!

36:12.500 --> 36:15.100
We pulled off the impossible.

36:15.133 --> 36:17.066
Thank you for not giving up.

36:17.100 --> 36:18.367
We were killer.

36:18.400 --> 36:19.500
I think you all
deserve a portion

36:19.533 --> 36:21.567
of my tip for the weight
you pulled.

36:21.600 --> 36:22.667
Aw, that's really kind.
We're not gonna do that.

36:22.700 --> 36:24.367
You could buy us a shot, though.

36:24.400 --> 36:25.533
-Yes!
-Oh, all the drinks.

36:25.567 --> 36:26.533
There you go!

36:26.567 --> 36:27.767
First round's on you.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.033
You were incredible.

36:30.066 --> 36:32.400
I love that the client
acknowledged that.

36:32.433 --> 36:35.467
Deck, we didn't hit anything,
so we're good.

36:35.500 --> 36:38.367
So, it's $25,800.

36:38.400 --> 36:42.700
Per person, 1,718
in dollars... well done.

36:42.734 --> 36:45.333
-So, cheers, everybody.
-Yeah, thank you.

36:45.367 --> 36:47.100
Cheers, you guys.

36:47.133 --> 36:48.300
Oh, dear,
I don't want it to break.

36:49.667 --> 36:52.400
Let's turn this boat.

36:52.433 --> 36:54.033
Do you want to start
stripping this bed?

36:56.333 --> 36:58.300
Are you sensible with your tip
money, in terms of saving?

36:58.333 --> 37:00.100
-Yes.
-Yeah?

37:00.133 --> 37:02.033
The money from this, though,
I'm paying my parents back.

37:02.066 --> 37:03.767
What did you borrow for?

37:04.000 --> 37:05.400
Do my yacht master
and change my career.

37:05.433 --> 37:06.500
Oh, nice.

37:06.533 --> 37:08.033
Do I want the tips?
Yeah.

37:08.066 --> 37:10.567
Do I owe my parents
lots of money? Yes.

37:14.333 --> 37:15.734
Z, how old are you?

37:15.767 --> 37:17.333
I'm 26 tomorrow.

37:17.367 --> 37:18.667
What, it's your
birthday tomorrow?

37:18.700 --> 37:19.667
-Yeah.
yeah!

37:19.700 --> 37:21.667
-Oh, my God!
-Hey

37:21.700 --> 37:24.400
-What?
-Deck crew's gonna be hungover.

37:24.433 --> 37:25.700
No, I'm just kidding.

37:27.333 --> 37:29.600
First night out.

37:29.633 --> 37:32.033
We do have someone's
birthday to celebrate.

37:32.066 --> 37:33.433
-Woo-woo!
-Yeah!

37:33.467 --> 37:35.033
Lexi, are you excited?

37:35.066 --> 37:37.533
Finally, a glass
of wine for ourselves.

37:39.066 --> 37:40.700
It's our first crew night out.

37:40.734 --> 37:42.567
Like, it's been
the charter from hell.

37:44.367 --> 37:46.033
But we survived
and want a drink.

37:53.500 --> 37:54.667
You got it!

37:56.633 --> 37:59.400
Chef is definitely buying us our
first ----ing round.

37:59.433 --> 38:01.033
-Oh, yes, yes.
-He's buying us a round.

38:03.567 --> 38:05.133
Thank you.

38:05.166 --> 38:07.100
Thank you, babes, such a gent.

38:11.700 --> 38:13.200
I feel like we're at
speed-dating.

38:13.233 --> 38:15.633
Yeah.

38:15.667 --> 38:17.166
Can we have two espresso
martinis, please?

38:17.200 --> 38:18.467
A shot of tequila, chilled.

38:18.500 --> 38:20.066
What's everyone's Tinder bio?

38:20.100 --> 38:23.066
I don't think this side
of the table needs Tinder.

38:23.100 --> 38:24.633
Oh!

38:24.667 --> 38:26.066
Yes!

38:26.100 --> 38:27.600
-You're all straight, yeah?
-Yeah.

38:27.633 --> 38:29.467
Me and, like, two
other guys

38:29.500 --> 38:31.600
did contemporary dance
when I was at school.

38:31.633 --> 38:34.367
So it's just, like,
leaping and, like.

38:34.400 --> 38:36.100
We used to get called gay
for doing it,

38:36.133 --> 38:38.567
and then when they found out
that we'd spend our weekends

38:38.600 --> 38:40.467
with, like, 30 girls,

38:40.500 --> 38:43.000
we were like,
jokes on you, bruv.

38:43.033 --> 38:44.600
She's like, "I'm just
calculating here."

38:50.767 --> 38:52.166
Ooh!

38:52.200 --> 38:54.066
I love this lady.

38:54.100 --> 38:55.700
I just ----ing love tequila.

38:55.734 --> 38:57.533
It's the only upper
alcohol you can drink.

38:57.567 --> 39:00.100
Like, it's just good vibes, man.

39:00.133 --> 39:01.633
Like, who doesn't
love a good vibe?

39:01.667 --> 39:03.633
-Z, happy birthday!
-Yay!

39:03.667 --> 39:05.633
Happy birthday, Mzi!

39:05.667 --> 39:07.200
It's like a replacement
boyfriend.

39:09.033 --> 39:10.533
No, they piss me off,
tequila's better.

39:15.433 --> 39:16.433
Mm!

39:19.000 --> 39:20.700
And it's nice to see
her kind of letting loose.

39:20.734 --> 39:22.600
But it's definitely
a new dynamic,

39:22.633 --> 39:26.500
being attracted
to someone who's my boss.

39:26.533 --> 39:28.200
That whole round was on me,
thank you guys.

39:28.233 --> 39:29.600
Guys, he just bought
this round for us!

39:29.633 --> 39:31.400
-Aw!
-Thank you!

39:31.433 --> 39:32.400
Thanks, Mat.

39:32.433 --> 39:33.500
Okay, seven more to go.

39:35.600 --> 39:37.533
So, remember that day when
we didn't get a break?

39:37.567 --> 39:39.000
Yeah.

39:39.033 --> 39:41.166
Him and Alex are
gonna be drinking all night.

39:41.200 --> 39:44.734
Do you guys need a cart behind
the bar, or the chair?

39:44.767 --> 39:49.066
I get it, but I can't
change what happened.

39:49.100 --> 39:50.700
And I feel bad, obviously.

39:50.734 --> 39:52.700
Wait, Mat, so this covers
the cheese plate.

39:52.734 --> 39:54.233
Yeah.

39:58.133 --> 39:59.600
Carry on.

40:07.200 --> 40:07.467
Thank you, guys.

40:08.734 --> 40:09.734
Guys, he just bought
this round for us!

40:09.767 --> 40:11.734
-Aw!
-Thank you!

40:11.767 --> 40:13.166
-Thanks, Mat.
-Okay, seven more to go.

40:15.734 --> 40:18.166
Just kidding.

40:18.200 --> 40:19.633
Fish option for me.

40:19.667 --> 40:21.700
May I have the
vegetarian, please? Thank you.

40:21.734 --> 40:23.200
For the lady?

40:23.233 --> 40:24.200
-Can I have the fish, please.
-Fish option.

40:24.233 --> 40:25.300
Yes.

40:25.333 --> 40:26.500
She's ordering for me as well.

40:26.533 --> 40:27.533
Daddy will take the fish.

40:29.367 --> 40:31.066
Just like a joke, you know?

40:31.100 --> 40:33.100
Daddy loves it, though.

40:33.133 --> 40:36.600
Yeah.
I'll be back in a moment.

40:38.100 --> 40:39.066
Mm.

40:39.100 --> 40:41.200
He looks fine.

40:41.233 --> 40:43.166
You've got a good
personality like that,

40:43.200 --> 40:45.066
so I could not care, yeah.

40:45.100 --> 40:46.200
Yeah, I'd anything.

40:46.233 --> 40:47.233
Oh, my God.

40:53.266 --> 40:54.600
So...

40:54.633 --> 40:57.233
Are the girls allowed
to look, guys?

40:57.266 --> 40:59.367
I had a circle-jerk
with me and two girls.

40:59.400 --> 41:00.600
They're very nice guys.

41:02.066 --> 41:05.233
I find the girls attractive.

41:05.266 --> 41:06.700
The guys, looks-wise...

41:08.133 --> 41:09.233
They're nice.

41:09.266 --> 41:11.033
How about Mathew?

41:11.066 --> 41:12.667
No, no.

41:12.700 --> 41:15.166
He's like my creepy uncle.

41:15.200 --> 41:17.567
Mat does give me
creepy uncle vibes.

41:17.600 --> 41:21.533
But, like, you know, creepy
uncle can give you... eh.

41:23.734 --> 41:26.333
-Yah!
-Yah!

41:26.367 --> 41:28.266
-Thank you so much.
-Tuna with balsamic.

41:28.300 --> 41:29.633
-Appreciate it.
-Thank you.

41:29.667 --> 41:31.133
Bon appétit.

41:33.667 --> 41:36.333
Okay, Z,
happy birthday, Daddy...

41:36.367 --> 41:38.600
-You're 27 now.
-I'm 27!

41:43.066 --> 41:44.233
-Aw!
-No, we--

41:44.266 --> 41:46.667
Aw!

41:46.700 --> 41:47.767
-Oh!
-Yeah.

41:48.000 --> 41:49.300
Happy birthday, Daddy!

41:52.166 --> 41:53.667
What do I wanna be...

41:53.700 --> 41:55.633
I actually do enjoy getting
called "daddy," but...

41:55.667 --> 41:57.266
It's the best, it's the best!

41:57.300 --> 42:01.133
Courtney called me daddy...
whatever makes you happy.

42:01.166 --> 42:03.033
Daddy.

42:03.066 --> 42:04.266
Mzi is a daddy!

42:04.300 --> 42:06.133
I definitely have
a crush on Courtney.

42:06.166 --> 42:09.100
I want that as my alarm...
daddy, daddy.

42:09.133 --> 42:11.200
I wanna wake up to
that every morning.

42:11.233 --> 42:13.333
"Daddy, it's time to wake up,
get yourself a coffee."

42:13.367 --> 42:15.133
It, like, changes my whole day

42:15.166 --> 42:18.100
when the person I'm starting
my day with is positive.

42:18.133 --> 42:20.000
Yeah, because if you get me
I'd be, like off.

42:20.033 --> 42:23.400
And I'd be like, "You can say
off in the soup pantry,

42:23.433 --> 42:24.400
but not in the galley."

42:24.433 --> 42:26.266
He was mad at me.

42:26.300 --> 42:27.734
He was, like, "I'm the boss
of this galley, get out."

42:27.767 --> 42:29.700
Are we really gonna discuss...
she...

42:29.734 --> 42:31.433
I swept a pile of dirt
and she stood in it,

42:31.467 --> 42:33.033
and I asked her to move and she
wouldn't move, and I was upset.

42:33.066 --> 42:34.367
Okay, so he swept...

42:34.400 --> 42:36.033
he swept a pile of dirt
that I wasn't aware of.

42:36.066 --> 42:37.166
-Okay, so I ran out...
-But then I told you...

42:37.200 --> 42:38.667
Shh!

42:38.700 --> 42:40.600
I'm like, "Plate the
----ing lamb chops."

42:40.633 --> 42:43.166
Like, "That's all I want
you to do right now."

42:43.200 --> 42:44.667
I'm not disrespectful

42:44.700 --> 42:47.200
unless someone's
being disrespectful to me.

42:48.700 --> 42:50.367
We're living and working
with people

42:50.400 --> 42:53.100
who we wouldn't even speak
to in normal circumstances.

42:53.133 --> 42:54.266
You wouldn't speak to me
in normal circumstance?

42:54.300 --> 42:55.700
You wouldn't speak to me.

42:55.734 --> 42:57.433
-That's not true!
-Bullsh--.

42:57.467 --> 42:59.033
Let's not talk about it.

43:06.433 --> 43:08.066
Next, on "Below Deck
Mediterranean."

43:08.100 --> 43:09.667
-Happy birthday, Daddy!

43:09.700 --> 43:10.667
Yeah!

43:10.700 --> 43:11.700
Daddy!

43:11.734 --> 43:13.100
Woo-woo!

43:13.133 --> 43:15.367
What? No!
We kissed last night!

43:15.400 --> 43:17.033
Are you in love now, Z?

43:18.467 --> 43:19.467
Oh!

43:19.500 --> 43:21.133
Roy Orbison Jr.

43:21.166 --> 43:22.133
and his wife, Asa,
are repeat charter guests.

43:22.166 --> 43:23.200
Go ahead, Roy-Roy!

43:23.233 --> 43:25.100
-Hi!
-Oh!

43:25.133 --> 43:27.734
I thought there's a family,
they're not big drinkers.

43:27.767 --> 43:29.667
Happy times!

43:29.700 --> 43:32.700
When was the last time you
were tickled by a grown man?

43:32.734 --> 43:34.066
Boy, was I wrong.

43:34.100 --> 43:35.066
Go to bed, now.

43:35.100 --> 43:36.100
I'm going in the water.

43:36.133 --> 43:37.734
Can you bring that downstairs?

43:37.767 --> 43:40.200
Well, you need to be outside so
you can tell us where things go.

43:40.233 --> 43:41.667
Yo, stop it.

43:41.700 --> 43:44.233
I'm the boss of the way
food gets put away.

43:44.266 --> 43:45.767
That's what I'm telling you!

43:46.000 --> 43:48.066
Oh, you're so argumentative
about nothing.

43:48.100 --> 43:51.333
She's going out of her way
to try to be bossy,

43:51.367 --> 43:53.033
and I do not like that.

43:57.066 --> 43:58.233
Of, like, human names on there?

43:58.266 --> 44:00.033
-Yes.
-Oh!

44:00.066 --> 44:02.100
It kinda makes me wanna
sleep with one eye open.

44:02.133 --> 44:04.667
Like, the [bleep]?

44:08.166 --> 44:10.200
Oh sh--!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
