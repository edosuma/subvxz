08:06.320 --> 08:09.030
Well, that cleans me out.

08:06.320 --> 08:09.030
Anyone got a tip?

08:09.072 --> 08:10.657
Here's a tip.

08:14.202 --> 08:18.373
If you tickle me

08:14.202 --> 08:18.373
with a feather duster..

08:18.415 --> 08:20.667
...I purr like Catwoman.

08:20.708 --> 08:22.043
'Thanks. Bye.'

08:22.085 --> 08:24.004
[indistinct]

08:25.422 --> 08:27.048
Oh!

08:27.090 --> 08:30.177
Well, it smells like something

08:27.090 --> 08:30.177
crawled in there and died!

08:30.218 --> 08:32.304
They should have delivered

08:30.218 --> 08:32.304
that thing in a lead box.

08:32.346 --> 08:35.182
It's double feta cheese

08:32.346 --> 08:35.182
and lamb guts.

08:37.184 --> 08:38.518
Enjoy!

08:40.061 --> 08:41.938
Uh, Deej, we'd love

08:40.061 --> 08:41.938
to stay, but..

08:41.980 --> 08:44.274
Uh, b-but I'm gonna hurl.

08:47.444 --> 08:49.363
- Hey, you guys.

08:47.444 --> 08:49.363
- Hi.

08:49.404 --> 08:51.990
Whew! That was a great workout.

08:53.783 --> 08:55.785
That is hot.

08:58.372 --> 08:59.622
Excuse me?

08:59.664 --> 09:03.168
I mean the cheese...is hot.

09:04.294 --> 09:06.587
It's dang-near bubbling.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.133
Really?

09:10.175 --> 09:11.385
Well, uh..

09:11.426 --> 09:13.594
...don't burn the roof

09:11.426 --> 09:13.594
of your mouth.

09:28.193 --> 09:30.362
Beautiful.

09:30.404 --> 09:32.613
Well, it's...just a carrot.

09:35.450 --> 09:38.412
Anyone tell you

09:35.450 --> 09:38.412
you hold vegetables like..

09:39.287 --> 09:41.164
...Greek goddess?

09:41.206 --> 09:42.916
Not recently.

09:44.167 --> 09:45.502
Mmm!

09:46.586 --> 09:49.381
And you smell...poppin' fresh.

09:51.383 --> 09:54.469
Well, I was just at the gym

09:51.383 --> 09:54.469
and I rubbed on some Bengay.

09:56.637 --> 09:58.598
This "Ben" lucky guy.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.063
Hey!

10:05.105 --> 10:07.190
Oh, sorry.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.190
Y-you smell so good

10:07.232 --> 10:09.734
I-I-I just can't control..

10:09.776 --> 10:11.528
Bad nose! Bad nose!

10:11.570 --> 10:12.904
Stavros..

10:12.946 --> 10:15.365
...you keep your nose

10:12.946 --> 10:15.365
out of my business.

10:15.407 --> 10:18.326
Sorry. Is, uh..

10:15.407 --> 10:18.326
I-I will spank nose.

10:18.368 --> 10:20.120
He has mind of its own.

10:20.161 --> 10:22.497
Bad nose. Bad, bad nose.

10:24.082 --> 10:25.417
Bad nose.

10:28.253 --> 10:29.588
Beep-beep.

10:31.672 --> 10:33.758
Hey, look, gang. Pizza.

10:35.176 --> 10:37.387
[all groaning]

10:37.429 --> 10:40.474
When did they start using

10:37.429 --> 10:40.474
dirty laundry as a topping?

10:42.392 --> 10:44.144
At least there's

10:42.392 --> 10:44.144
one happy customer.

10:44.185 --> 10:46.313
[growling softly]

10:46.354 --> 10:47.897
Or not.

10:47.939 --> 10:50.150
[whimpering]

10:50.191 --> 10:53.694
Guys...I am not a happy camper.

10:50.191 --> 10:53.694
Look at this.

10:53.736 --> 10:56.197
I-I got a parking ticket for

10:53.736 --> 10:56.197
parking next to a fire hydrant.

10:56.239 --> 10:58.116
Stavros just

10:56.239 --> 10:58.116
cost me 65 bucks.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.910
Yeah, well, he cost me

10:58.158 --> 11:00.910
20 bucks and my watch.

11:00.952 --> 11:02.703
Wait. He had 20 bucks?

11:02.745 --> 11:06.500
He cost me 20 bucks for

11:02.745 --> 11:06.500
that hot goat on dough.

11:06.541 --> 11:08.376
Yeah, well, he hustles

11:06.541 --> 11:08.376
more than just money.

11:08.418 --> 11:11.838
When I was in the kitchen with

11:08.418 --> 11:11.838
him, he tried to hit on me.

11:11.879 --> 11:14.132
Wow. Stavros is a sleazebag.

11:14.174 --> 11:17.344
Well, you know, he does

11:14.174 --> 11:17.344
have one good quality.

11:17.385 --> 11:20.679
He's leaving

11:17.385 --> 11:20.679
Thursday at 9:18.

11:20.721 --> 11:21.973
I think maybe we should

11:20.721 --> 11:21.973
just, you know

11:22.015 --> 11:24.934
try to hang in there

11:22.015 --> 11:24.934
until then, okay?

11:24.976 --> 11:26.811
Hey, guys. Oh, I'm glad

11:24.976 --> 11:26.811
you're all here.

11:26.853 --> 11:29.648
What do you think of Stavros?

11:26.853 --> 11:29.648
Isn't he a great guy?

11:29.730 --> 11:32.192
- Oh, yeah.

11:29.730 --> 11:32.192
- He's been really nice.

11:32.233 --> 11:34.235
Yeah. It's a shame

11:32.233 --> 11:34.235
he has to leave so soon.

11:34.277 --> 11:36.613
Thursday, 9:18.

11:36.655 --> 11:39.115
Well, I don't know, guys,

11:36.655 --> 11:39.115
I have great news. Now get this.

11:39.157 --> 11:41.993
Because Stavros loves America

11:39.157 --> 11:41.993
and all you guys so much

11:42.035 --> 11:43.620
he's thinking about moving here.

11:43.662 --> 11:45.664
I figured, since everyone

11:43.662 --> 11:45.664
gets along so well

11:45.704 --> 11:47.957
I've asked him to, you know,

11:45.704 --> 11:47.957
stay here and live here with us

11:47.999 --> 11:49.125
until he gets settled.

11:49.167 --> 11:51.211
What do you guys think?

12:04.683 --> 12:06.893
Uh, Jess, I don't know

12:06.934 --> 12:09.646
if Stavros staying here

12:06.934 --> 12:09.646
is such a good idea.

12:09.688 --> 12:12.440
Danny, it's okay. You know what,

12:09.688 --> 12:12.440
I-I know what your concern is.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.901
Stavros used your razor

12:12.482 --> 12:14.901
to shave his chest

12:14.942 --> 12:15.985
but, you know what,

12:14.942 --> 12:15.985
I'll talk to him about it.

12:16.027 --> 12:17.696
No. That's not it..

12:17.736 --> 12:19.280
He did what?

12:20.532 --> 12:21.866
Jess, the guy's a con man.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.411
'He's been hustling us

12:21.908 --> 12:24.411
ever since he got here.'

12:24.452 --> 12:27.163
Con man?

12:27.205 --> 12:30.041
I can't believe what you guys

12:27.205 --> 12:30.041
are saying here.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.502
Now, when I was a stranger

12:30.083 --> 12:32.502
in Stavros' country

12:32.544 --> 12:34.379
he treated me like a,

12:32.544 --> 12:34.379
like a brother.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.881
And he's family. You insult

12:34.421 --> 12:36.881
Stavros, you insult me.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.677
Listen, Jess. Stavros

12:38.425 --> 12:40.677
made a pass at me.

12:40.719 --> 12:42.596
I had to hit him

12:40.719 --> 12:42.596
with a carrot.

12:42.637 --> 12:44.264
'Honey, i-it's okay.

12:42.637 --> 12:44.264
H-he told me about it.'

12:44.305 --> 12:45.432
It's all a big

12:44.305 --> 12:45.432
misunderstanding.

12:45.473 --> 12:46.725
He's Greek. You know

12:45.473 --> 12:46.725
how Greeks are?

12:46.765 --> 12:48.309
T-they're passionate.

12:46.765 --> 12:48.309
They're physical.

12:48.351 --> 12:50.395
He didn't mean anything by it.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.652
Hey, Stavros.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.652
Where are you going?

12:57.694 --> 12:59.112
Back home to Greece.

12:59.153 --> 13:00.655
Well, have a nice trip.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.449
- Yeah! Bye!

13:00.697 --> 13:02.449
- See you later!

13:02.490 --> 13:04.284
[indistinct chatter]

13:04.325 --> 13:05.784
Stavros, you can't leave yet.

13:05.826 --> 13:09.038
Oh, sorry, Jesse. Just spoke

13:05.826 --> 13:09.038
to relatives back home.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.998
Huge disaster.

13:11.040 --> 13:14.085
Eh-eh-eh, village

13:11.040 --> 13:14.085
of Polopolis is no more.

13:14.127 --> 13:17.213

13:19.840 --> 13:21.384

13:21.426 --> 13:23.136
- Oh, man. Sorry.

13:21.426 --> 13:23.136
- Oh, wow.

13:23.177 --> 13:26.347
That's terrible. Is there

13:23.177 --> 13:26.347
anything we can do?

13:26.389 --> 13:28.182
I don't know.

13:28.224 --> 13:31.060
Now I must go home.

13:31.102 --> 13:32.437
But first..

13:32.479 --> 13:35.523
...I must give back

13:32.479 --> 13:35.523
all things I took.

13:37.024 --> 13:38.901
Watch.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.780
Money.

13:41.820 --> 13:43.615
And apologize to pretty lady

13:43.657 --> 13:45.950
for...poor manners.

13:48.703 --> 13:50.955
Maybe mud slide

13:48.703 --> 13:50.955
is punishment..

13:50.997 --> 13:53.040
...because of bad behavior.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.376
I'm sorry.

13:57.545 --> 13:59.631
We're sorry too.

13:59.673 --> 14:01.591
What-what can we do

13:59.673 --> 14:01.591
to help you?

14:02.008 --> 14:03.301
Eh..

14:04.636 --> 14:06.304
I don't know.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.265
If only some way

14:06.346 --> 14:09.265
to raise funds.

14:09.307 --> 14:11.351
How about a fund-raiser?

14:12.477 --> 14:14.312
Why I no think of that?

14:14.354 --> 14:15.605
That's a great idea.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.605
You know what?

for the children's

14:19.984 --> 14:21.611

14:21.653 --> 14:23.946
Volunteers would dance

14:21.653 --> 14:23.946
and people would sponsor 'em.

14:23.988 --> 14:26.700
We made a fortune.

14:26.741 --> 14:28.702
I volunteer to dance

14:26.741 --> 14:28.702

I bet this whole

16:53.888 --> 16:57.558
feels about Stavros, Steph.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.226
'He's not gonna believe us.'

16:59.268 --> 17:01.020
We're gonna have to prove it

16:59.268 --> 17:01.020
to him, and you know what?

17:01.061 --> 17:03.397

17:01.061 --> 17:03.397
to do it. Come here.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.347
Michelle said you wanted

17:33.720 --> 17:36.347
to see me alone.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.224
Oh, yes.

17:38.265 --> 17:39.642
I'll be frank.

17:39.684 --> 17:41.811
Can I still be Stavros?

17:44.063 --> 17:47.233
Whatever turns you on.

17:47.274 --> 17:49.652
Stavros, I know I haven't

17:47.274 --> 17:49.652
known you that long

17:49.694 --> 17:52.238
but...I have the--

Well, I wasn't going to put it

17:56.075 --> 17:59.161
exactly like that, but..

Yes-yes.

I don't know

18:01.080 --> 18:02.540
if you know this

18:02.582 --> 18:05.835

18:02.582 --> 18:05.835

But, um, first..

18:23.644 --> 18:26.313
...I'd like to ask

18:23.644 --> 18:26.313
you a question.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.274

18:26.355 --> 18:28.274
to run away with me

18:28.315 --> 18:30.443

18:30.484 --> 18:34.280

- Mm-hmm.

What about this benefit and

18:48.711 --> 18:51.005
all the money we're raising?

18:51.047 --> 18:53.007
Oh, Becky.

18:53.049 --> 18:57.136

How come you're not Jesse

19:12.777 --> 19:15.822
in a jealous rage?

19:15.863 --> 19:18.324
Maybe because

19:15.863 --> 19:18.324
we couldn't hear you?

19:20.076 --> 19:21.869
I should probably turn

19:20.076 --> 19:21.869
the microphone on.

To my family?

21:12.146 --> 21:15.775
I trusted you, man.
