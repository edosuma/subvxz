03:43.676 --> 03:45.428
Wait.

03:45.470 --> 03:46.471
What?

03:48.181 --> 03:49.307
This.

03:50.810 --> 03:51.852
Later.

03:53.479 --> 03:55.440
I wanna smoke.

03:58.151 --> 04:00.070
I wanna smoke.

04:01.655 --> 04:03.741
Fine. Smoke.

04:07.245 --> 04:09.164
Smoke all night.

05:14.614 --> 05:17.409
Be still.
Do not turn around.

05:17.493 --> 05:19.328
Do not turn around.

05:19.411 --> 05:21.331
You will not be hurt.

10:43.621 --> 10:45.539
- Bonjour, Nick.
- Bonjour, madame.

11:34.054 --> 11:35.139
Albert.

11:37.933 --> 11:40.227
Boss, hi.

11:40.311 --> 11:43.231
- Jean-Claude.
- So, the trip was good?

11:45.109 --> 11:46.861
- So, how are we doing?
- Great.

11:46.902 --> 11:49.363
We have many reservations
for tonight.

11:49.405 --> 11:51.449
Good. How many covers
did we have last night?

11:51.532 --> 11:53.451
- Over 150.
- Good.

11:53.534 --> 11:56.371
- Bar was steady.
- How was the music?

11:56.412 --> 11:59.000
- Great band.
- Good. Good.

12:03.379 --> 12:05.423
Scotch on the rocks, please,
little water.

12:05.507 --> 12:07.425
Yeah, sure.

12:23.903 --> 12:26.073
Monsieur Max.

12:26.156 --> 12:28.825
Where... Where Nicky?

12:30.577 --> 12:33.831
Voila. Back from Bermuda.

12:33.914 --> 12:35.374
Did you have a good trip?

12:35.458 --> 12:38.253
Well, not as interesting
as yours, I'm sure.

12:39.838 --> 12:42.925
My God!
Let me get a look at you.

12:42.967 --> 12:45.511
You look like shit.
What's your secret?

12:46.637 --> 12:48.599
Jean-Claude,
set up number two for us.

12:48.641 --> 12:50.184
Yeah, sure.

12:57.191 --> 12:59.652
Just give us a little room.
Thank you.

13:03.241 --> 13:04.867
For sure.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.870
There we are.

13:11.917 --> 13:13.335
Bermuda.

13:17.173 --> 13:18.592
Oh, God.

13:20.135 --> 13:22.054
Well.

13:22.137 --> 13:25.849
- It was pretty tight out there.
- Good. It'll keep you sharp.

13:27.853 --> 13:31.023
I got a minor development.

13:31.106 --> 13:33.942
- We lost the buyer.
- What do you mean, "lost"?

13:34.026 --> 13:37.738
Well, she's in a brass casket
six feet underground...

13:37.822 --> 13:39.992
never to be heard from again.

13:40.951 --> 13:42.995
Well, I fronted 20,000
in expenses.

13:43.037 --> 13:45.748
Now I'm due that,
plus 250 for my end.

13:45.831 --> 13:47.833
You don't think I'm not
gonna take care of you?

13:47.875 --> 13:49.877
I'm not gonna cover
your expenses and all that?

13:49.961 --> 13:53.549
It's not about covering my expenses.
It's the money. Find another buyer.

13:53.632 --> 13:56.052
Of course. But Jesus Christ,
shit happens.

13:56.135 --> 13:58.262
This thing's gonna drag out.
You've got to be patient.

13:58.930 --> 14:02.308
Wait a minute.
How about this?

14:02.392 --> 14:05.438
Four big ones in your hand.

14:05.521 --> 14:07.815
Four million dollars
in your mitt.

14:08.691 --> 14:11.152
- Four million?
- More than you ever dreamed of.

14:11.236 --> 14:14.114
More than we ever,
ever did together.

14:14.197 --> 14:16.366
Four million.
What are you into?

14:16.408 --> 14:19.662
Well, I spotted this item
which was really exceptional.

14:19.746 --> 14:23.625
It was European antiquity,
elegant...

14:23.708 --> 14:26.461
and it was in the hands
of this real dumb prick...

14:26.545 --> 14:28.130
that didn't know what he had.

14:29.173 --> 14:31.218
And unfortunately...

14:31.301 --> 14:33.720
it's become detained
in transit a little.

14:37.266 --> 14:39.310
You don't wanna know where?

14:39.393 --> 14:41.103
It depends.

14:41.187 --> 14:42.688
Depends on what?

14:42.772 --> 14:45.776
- On what you're gonna tell me.
- Okay.

14:45.859 --> 14:49.155
It's in the Montreal
Customshouse.

14:51.699 --> 14:55.411
- No way. I'm sorry.
- Oh, yeah. Wait a minute.

14:55.453 --> 14:58.457
I got a guy...
I got a guy inside.

14:58.541 --> 15:02.962
He gives you the whole layout,
handles security, everything...

15:03.046 --> 15:08.009
You used to tell me, "Steal outside
the country, in the States, Europe.

15:08.093 --> 15:09.595
But Montreal,
live in Montreal."

15:09.637 --> 15:12.307
I said a lot of dumb things
in my day, didn't I?

15:12.390 --> 15:13.683
- But that's...
- Right.

15:14.893 --> 15:19.523
Let's just find another buyer
for this. I gotta open the place.

15:19.606 --> 15:22.402
Okay, but I'm not finished
talking about this.

15:24.654 --> 15:28.200
- Come on.
- You're making a large error here.

15:34.582 --> 15:36.501
Not bad.

15:48.432 --> 15:50.184
- Yeah?
- I just landed.

15:50.267 --> 15:52.186
I got the delivery.

16:14.212 --> 16:15.713
Got the bag?

16:15.797 --> 16:18.591
- Yeah. Right here.
- Where's Johnny?

16:18.675 --> 16:22.012
He got it in Istanbul,
right through the neck.

16:22.054 --> 16:24.306
- Jesus. He was a good kid.
- Yeah.

16:24.389 --> 16:26.100
Good and dead.

16:26.183 --> 16:28.144
So you wanna talk,
or you wanna see what I got?

16:28.228 --> 16:30.689
How can I be sure you're okay?

16:32.065 --> 16:33.650
I suppose I could fuck you.

16:34.526 --> 16:35.945
That would work.

16:57.219 --> 16:59.680
Hey. You okay?

17:00.807 --> 17:02.308
Yeah. Great.

17:07.356 --> 17:10.693
- How was your trip?
- I don't know.

17:11.569 --> 17:13.655
Cities.

17:13.738 --> 17:17.743
They're all starting to look
the same. They really are.

17:24.584 --> 17:28.046
And the pasta in Rome
is not as good as yours.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.801
And the ass pinchers.

17:31.885 --> 17:34.429
They used to look
so charmingly European.

17:34.513 --> 17:36.431
Not as good as me?

17:40.936 --> 17:42.897
Come on.

17:43.774 --> 17:46.068
It really must be
what it is about you I like...

17:46.110 --> 17:48.612
because you most definitely
are not common.

17:55.078 --> 17:57.665
- What if I were?
- What if you were what?

17:57.748 --> 18:00.793
A little more common,
you know, and around more.

18:00.877 --> 18:02.795
How much more?

18:02.879 --> 18:04.964
Like, "all the time" more.

18:05.048 --> 18:07.425
And I was just a jazz club owner
and not that other thing.

18:07.467 --> 18:08.843
How would you feel about that?

18:11.347 --> 18:13.892
Hey, are you saying
what I think you're saying?

18:13.975 --> 18:16.519
I think that's what I'm saying.

18:20.899 --> 18:25.196
Hey, baby, you know I've never
asked you to change anything for me.

18:25.280 --> 18:28.367
I know that. I'm just asking you,
how would you feel about that?

18:35.917 --> 18:38.045
I don't know.

18:40.381 --> 18:43.384
I suppose I'd have to give it
some serious thought.

18:45.511 --> 18:48.307
Then you'd better start
giving it some serious thought.

18:57.984 --> 19:01.238
Thank you.
So I'll see you when I see you?

19:01.322 --> 19:03.241
See you when I see you.

19:42.369 --> 19:45.623
Excuse me.
Can you help me, please?

19:46.791 --> 19:48.876
Can you help me?

19:48.960 --> 19:51.087
- Place Norman?
- Yes, yes.

19:51.170 --> 19:53.674
You go to the corner,
make a right. Go two blocks...

19:53.757 --> 19:56.927
- Two.
- Two blocks, then a left one block.

19:57.011 --> 19:59.514
- Again, please.
- Two blocks this way...

19:59.555 --> 20:01.099
one block that way to the left.

20:01.182 --> 20:03.726
- And you're right there.
- Okay, thank you.

20:03.810 --> 20:05.354
Thank you, Nick.

20:07.690 --> 20:09.442
What did you say?

20:09.525 --> 20:12.028
I said, "Thank you, Nick."

20:14.406 --> 20:18.453
I'm Max's guy in the customshouse.
We should talk.

20:19.996 --> 20:21.998
Okay, bye-bye. Thank you.

20:22.082 --> 20:24.000
Thank you. Bye.

20:30.091 --> 20:32.844
- Where's Max?
- He's in the sunroom.

20:37.141 --> 20:39.560
Nicoli, Nicoli.

20:39.602 --> 20:41.812
Have you lost
your fucking mind?

20:41.896 --> 20:44.858
My mind? Years ago. Why?

20:44.942 --> 20:47.861
- What did you tell this kid?
- What did I tell who?

20:47.945 --> 20:49.905
Your inside guy
with the retard act.

20:49.989 --> 20:52.074
He was in front of my house.
He knew who I was.

20:54.035 --> 20:57.998
Wait. He must've followed me to
the club and made you from there.

20:58.082 --> 21:00.501
Tell him he pulls a stunt like that
again, he'll end up in the hospital.

21:00.584 --> 21:04.756
Wait. Do you think I'm gonna set
you up with a jerk-off heister?

21:04.839 --> 21:08.134
You gotta admit that this kid did
a pretty good dog and pony show.

21:08.176 --> 21:12.015
I don't care who is he. Don't expose
me like that. You know better.

21:12.098 --> 21:13.558
He's got it all pre-wired.

21:13.641 --> 21:15.977
- You go in, turn the key...
- I told you, I'm not interested.

21:16.019 --> 21:19.397
You're never gonna get another
chance at a score like this.

21:19.481 --> 21:21.442
- Why are you pushing this?
- Four million balls.

21:21.526 --> 21:23.319
How many times
do I have to tell you?

21:23.403 --> 21:25.363
He's pushing it
because we're running out of time.

21:26.156 --> 21:28.950
If I'm gonna work
with a partner on this...

21:28.992 --> 21:30.869
we gotta start putting
our heads together right away.

21:30.953 --> 21:32.413
- What are you doing in my house?
- Take it easy.

21:32.496 --> 21:35.208
- All I'm saying...
- Who the fuck is this kid?

21:35.292 --> 21:37.961
- What the fuck do you know?
- I've been on this for three weeks.

21:38.045 --> 21:41.006
I gotta know if you're the guy
that Max says you are.

21:41.090 --> 21:44.260
- I gotta go.
- Nick, wait. Wait.

21:45.594 --> 21:49.516
I didn't come 500 miles just to...
Jack Teller. Nice to meet you too.

21:49.558 --> 21:50.517
What the fuck?

21:50.559 --> 21:53.354
You're not smart enough
to know where your dick is.

21:53.437 --> 21:56.607
We decided that you were gonna
sit tight until I called you.

21:56.691 --> 21:58.025
- Is that correct?
- Okay.

21:58.067 --> 22:00.868
I thought I could help you sell him
on it. I thought he was already in.

22:00.946 --> 22:04.408
Don't be so fucking creative.
Just get the fuck out of my house.

22:04.492 --> 22:08.079
When you guys get your shit
together, give me a call, okay?

22:08.162 --> 22:09.414
Unbelievable.

22:13.836 --> 22:18.800
It's a lucky thing
you came my way

22:20.010 --> 22:22.179
Today

22:22.262 --> 22:26.309
I'm about to tell you
something you should know

22:29.229 --> 22:33.233
All you have to do
is let the plot unfold

22:36.111 --> 22:38.573
Desire is clear

22:38.615 --> 22:40.283
When you are near

22:40.367 --> 22:42.327
You're about to give in

22:45.414 --> 22:48.125
Don't tease me so

22:48.209 --> 22:49.669
I think you know

22:49.752 --> 22:51.922
You're about to give in

22:54.508 --> 22:58.262
And if you listen
we can both find peace

23:00.139 --> 23:02.475
Release

23:02.558 --> 23:06.105
Inhibitions that you
thought could not be there

24:15.560 --> 24:17.062
Jesus!

24:18.104 --> 24:20.065
God! Jesus! Take it easy.

24:21.526 --> 24:25.363
Listen close. Leave town
tonight. Don't come back.

24:25.405 --> 24:28.575
I see you again,
I break your fucking knees.

24:28.658 --> 24:30.118
I see you around Nick,
I'll kill ya.

24:30.202 --> 24:33.247
It's a dangerous fucking game
you're playing here.

24:33.330 --> 24:35.000
Are we clear?

24:41.006 --> 24:42.925
Yeah, we're clear.

25:23.764 --> 25:25.808
How did it go?

25:25.892 --> 25:27.310
Not as planned.

25:28.186 --> 25:32.482
- What do you want?
- Some fucking respect for starters.

25:33.317 --> 25:37.321
I mean, what are you thinking?
Now, I'm on a job here.

25:37.404 --> 25:40.325
Now, if you just don't wanna come
in on it, that's fine. Say "no."

25:40.409 --> 25:43.287
But don't send some third-rate
rent-a-thug to brush me off.

25:43.328 --> 25:44.997
You can do it
like a professional.

25:47.750 --> 25:48.959
Hello.

25:50.252 --> 25:53.215
Yeah. You okay?

25:53.298 --> 25:55.759
He's right here. Don't worry.
Just go home.

25:55.843 --> 25:59.055
I'll call you later, all right?
That's okay.

25:59.138 --> 26:00.556
Okay.

26:01.682 --> 26:03.852
I didn't come here
to cause any trouble.

26:03.936 --> 26:05.354
I didn't.

26:06.439 --> 26:10.276
Coming up to you on the street
like that, that was a stupid move.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.612
Sorry. Why don't we
just call it even?

26:12.695 --> 26:15.240
I just wanna say one thing to you,
then I'll go away.

26:15.323 --> 26:17.827
We don't have to bother each other
anymore if you don't want.

26:20.955 --> 26:24.000
I have been casing this place
for a couple of weeks now.

26:24.042 --> 26:27.754
It's a little bit complicated,
but this is a very doable job.

26:27.838 --> 26:31.092
I can handle the system in there
if someone can break into this box.

26:32.886 --> 26:34.846
Look, I don't know you,
you don't know me.

26:34.888 --> 26:37.391
I know that's not
the best way to do things, but...

26:37.432 --> 26:40.060
I am very good
at what I do, okay?

26:40.144 --> 26:43.899
And I take it very, very seriously.
You can check it out with Max.

26:43.982 --> 26:47.194
Now, if you are the guy
that he says you are...

26:47.277 --> 26:50.072
then we should check this out.

26:50.155 --> 26:52.074
Just... Just take a look at it.

26:52.158 --> 26:55.078
That's all I'm saying,
'cause this is a very big payoff...

26:55.162 --> 26:57.081
for very acceptable risks.

27:03.754 --> 27:06.299
Just take a look at it.
Go look for yourself.

27:10.096 --> 27:12.640
I like your place.

27:12.723 --> 27:14.642
You got good taste.

28:54.299 --> 28:57.011
Oh, Jesus.
It's nice and dark in here.

28:57.052 --> 28:59.096
Fucking everything.

29:02.058 --> 29:03.894
Jesus.

29:03.978 --> 29:06.647
Why don't you jump
for some lights in this place?

29:06.731 --> 29:11.361
Every time I come in here,
it's like hide-and-go-seek.

29:11.402 --> 29:13.363
How are you?

29:25.043 --> 29:29.048
Now, you gotta tell me the...

29:29.090 --> 29:31.760
the magic word.

29:31.843 --> 29:33.678
All right, I'm gonna do it.

29:33.762 --> 29:37.891
Good, good. Jesus, sweetheart.
You're a sweetheart.

29:37.975 --> 29:39.893
Bravo.
You're making sense.

29:41.020 --> 29:44.941
But because of the risk involved,
my end's gotta be six million.

29:47.820 --> 29:49.029
Operator?

29:49.113 --> 29:51.907
I got a nut down here
that just said six million.

29:53.242 --> 29:56.079
No, no. Send paramedics.
I think... Are you all right?

29:56.163 --> 29:57.206
I'm fine.

29:57.289 --> 29:59.959
Six fucking million dollars?
What happened to four?

30:00.042 --> 30:03.671
I'm doing it in my backyard. I'm
not gonna go like that. I'm sorry.

30:03.754 --> 30:05.673
If you want me to do this,
you gotta pay me what's right.

30:05.757 --> 30:08.803
- It's gotta be that way.
- I always pay you what's right.

30:08.886 --> 30:12.139
You always think you do.
I always know what you pay me.

30:12.223 --> 30:14.976
It's not always right.
I need this for this.

30:16.728 --> 30:18.021
I like your style.

30:18.104 --> 30:20.024
Yeah, well, okay.
I understand.

30:21.651 --> 30:24.863
That's what I have to do. I wanna
pay off the club, the mortgage.

30:24.946 --> 30:26.656
I wanna own this place
free and clear.

30:26.740 --> 30:29.242
I want it to be mine.
I live the way I want.

30:29.326 --> 30:30.619
Because after this,
no more jobs.

30:30.702 --> 30:33.957
This is the last one I'm doing.
I'm quitting for good.

30:34.040 --> 30:36.751
How many times have you
told me that in 25 years?

30:36.793 --> 30:39.129
I'm gonna believe that
when the pigs eat my brother.

30:39.171 --> 30:42.466
- Right?
- I'm done. I'm done. No more.

30:44.885 --> 30:48.307
Well, okay.
I hope she's worth it.

30:52.436 --> 30:54.355
Here's numb-nuts.

30:57.316 --> 31:00.154
Nice house, nice club.
You must be really good.

31:03.365 --> 31:05.493
I don't wanna have to do this,
but raise your arms.

31:08.287 --> 31:11.208
- Be my guest.
- He's all right.

31:14.503 --> 31:15.963
Okay?

31:23.054 --> 31:26.017
Is this a social call?
What are we doing here?

31:28.061 --> 31:29.646
I will explore this with you...

31:29.688 --> 31:32.524
but I run this operation
down to the smallest detail.

31:32.566 --> 31:35.861
If you have a problem with that,
we can all go home right now.

31:36.696 --> 31:38.323
Is there a problem with that?

31:39.449 --> 31:41.201
That's fine.

31:41.243 --> 31:44.329
You will tell me everything you
know, then I will design the plan.

31:44.371 --> 31:48.250
If I smell something about the job
or you that I don't like, I walk.

31:48.334 --> 31:51.421
If I think for one second you're
not living up to your end of it...

31:51.505 --> 31:54.258
or if you hold out on me
in any way, I walk.

31:54.341 --> 31:56.844
- Understood?
- That's fine.

31:56.886 --> 31:58.471
Tell me what you wanna know.

31:59.722 --> 32:03.769
- First, what are we looking for?
- You know what a scepter is?

32:03.852 --> 32:05.813
It's something
that a king holds.

32:06.939 --> 32:08.608
Right there.

32:08.691 --> 32:12.987
It was made in 1661 in France
for a special coronation...

32:14.197 --> 32:15.866
for a girl queen.

32:16.951 --> 32:19.787
- It's priceless.
- Not to us, it's not.

32:19.871 --> 32:22.916
What can you give me
on its specific location?

32:22.999 --> 32:25.319
I can give you the whole
building, okay? I got floor plans.

32:25.377 --> 32:28.005
I've been clocking the security
patterns for over three weeks.

32:28.089 --> 32:30.216
All right.
Paint me a picture.

32:31.426 --> 32:34.095
Okay. He fixed me up
with the job.

32:34.179 --> 32:36.640
Not me but Brian,
the guy on the street.

32:36.723 --> 32:38.058
Yeah, I remember.

32:38.100 --> 32:40.937
Is he traceable? Phone number?
Address? That stuff?

32:41.021 --> 32:43.356
It's totally tight. The guy's
a charity case, a favor.

32:43.440 --> 32:45.442
The guy truly doesn't
even exist on paper.

32:45.525 --> 32:48.570
He just shows up.
He's the assistant janitor...

32:48.654 --> 32:50.406
midnight to 8 a.m.

32:55.787 --> 32:57.414
The security's pretty basic.

32:57.498 --> 32:59.959
At night, they lock the place down.
They bar the ground floor windows.

33:00.000 --> 33:03.588
You can only enter in through
one place, out by the truck court.

33:07.134 --> 33:09.804
Thank you, Hubert.
Thank you.

33:09.887 --> 33:12.608
Manpower's very light. They got one
guy sitting in a booth outside...

33:12.682 --> 33:15.059
just keeping an eye on things.

33:16.728 --> 33:20.650
On the inside, everyone comes in
through a standard metal detector.

33:20.691 --> 33:24.779
It's tricky bringing things through,
but I've got that figured out.

33:24.821 --> 33:27.615
All the guards know me now,
so no one really looks too close.

33:27.657 --> 33:29.993
- Okay, thank you.
- All right.

33:30.076 --> 33:32.413
Once I'm inside,
I can go anywhere I want.

33:32.497 --> 33:33.957
Hey, Laurent.

33:33.998 --> 33:37.711
Everything gets run from this
one little central command console.

33:37.794 --> 33:41.632
They've got fixed video systems in
the elevators and in the hallways.

33:41.673 --> 33:44.761
They got a couple magnetic doors,
but it's all very basic.

33:44.844 --> 33:48.432
Lots of overtime.
Not so much now.

33:48.515 --> 33:50.809
Now, the head janitor's
this old guy, Danny.

33:50.851 --> 33:53.228
He loves Brian.
Loves him.

33:53.312 --> 33:55.689
I've got this guy completely
wrapped around my finger.

33:55.773 --> 33:58.193
He'd do anything for me.

33:58.235 --> 34:00.279
And most of the time,
he's got me working with him.

34:00.362 --> 34:02.156
Kind of low-level shit,
just helping out.

34:02.197 --> 34:05.576
But I can get away from him plenty.
I got all kinds of reasons.

34:05.660 --> 34:09.121
I've sketched half the place
already. I've copied a lot of keys.

34:09.205 --> 34:12.376
I can get you access to basically
any room in the place.

34:12.460 --> 34:14.003
Where's the scepter?

34:14.045 --> 34:16.964
Well, see, that's the kink.

34:17.047 --> 34:18.591
Now, get this.

34:18.675 --> 34:21.594
It was arranged to be
brought into the country...

34:21.678 --> 34:25.683
inside the leg
of an antique piano.

34:25.725 --> 34:29.521
And it was so simple.
Then they impounded it.

34:29.562 --> 34:31.563
I mean, can you guess why?

34:31.606 --> 34:34.443
Fucking bugs.

34:34.525 --> 34:38.031
I mean, the whole shipment
was contaminated with termites.

34:38.114 --> 34:40.074
Asian longhorn beetles.

34:41.159 --> 34:43.078
We got fucked by bugs.

34:45.539 --> 34:47.041
These things
burrow into the wood...

34:47.123 --> 34:49.002
so they were in the crates
of most of the shipment.

34:49.085 --> 34:51.545
So they took the goods out
and delivered most of them.

34:51.630 --> 34:54.424
But the piano is made of wood too,
so they impounded it.

34:54.507 --> 34:56.677
They took the whole thing
and put it in quarantine.

34:56.760 --> 34:59.388
Medium security,
third-floor lockup.

34:59.430 --> 35:01.015
They're really scared
of these things...

35:01.098 --> 35:02.768
and they can't send
them back to France.

35:05.437 --> 35:07.606
So they decided
to burn everything.

35:16.659 --> 35:18.619
Now, I'll tell ya...

35:18.661 --> 35:20.997
I didn't know which one of the
fucking legs this thing is in...

35:21.080 --> 35:24.209
but half of me was tempted to grab
them all and make a break for it.

35:24.292 --> 35:28.131
I mean, I don't know if this
thing's gonna melt or what.

35:29.298 --> 35:31.467
I mean, I was dying.

35:35.013 --> 35:37.349
I had to improvise a little.

35:42.063 --> 35:44.423
- I-I saw something in the fire.
- We're just burning stuff.

35:44.441 --> 35:48.654
No. Look, look.
I saw something in the...

35:48.737 --> 35:52.074
Piano. In the piano,
I saw a... Look.

35:52.157 --> 35:53.243
- I saw something.
- Jack!

35:54.619 --> 35:56.747
There! There!

35:58.916 --> 36:00.835
What is it?

36:10.471 --> 36:12.139
So everybody's freaking out.

36:12.181 --> 36:14.267
Nobody knows what this is
or what to do with it.

36:14.350 --> 36:16.310
They don't see this kind
of excitement down there.

36:16.352 --> 36:18.354
So they call some supervisor.
They get him out of bed.

36:18.438 --> 36:20.858
He comes down,
he takes one look at this thing.

36:20.942 --> 36:24.070
He doesn't know what the hell it is,
but he knows it's worth a lot.

36:24.153 --> 36:27.157
He tells them, until they can
sort it out, put it in the basement.

36:27.949 --> 36:30.076
- And that's what they do.
- Don't worry. Don't worry.

36:30.118 --> 36:32.622
- Don't worry about it.
- I want to see, Danny.

36:32.705 --> 36:35.416
- Can I see?
- No. Come on. Let's go now.

36:35.458 --> 36:37.919
Okay. Bye-bye. Bye.

36:53.395 --> 36:55.022
The basement
in the customshouse...

36:55.105 --> 36:57.401
is the most secure lockup
in eastern Canada.

36:57.484 --> 36:59.903
It was built as a bomb shelter
during the Cold War.

36:59.987 --> 37:03.449
All their important stuff's there...
state's evidence, narcotics...

37:03.532 --> 37:05.284
confiscated weapons.

37:05.326 --> 37:08.120
That scepter is in a safe
somewhere in this room.

37:08.162 --> 37:10.207
But the thing is,
there's no... there's no cameras.

37:10.290 --> 37:12.960
If there was, I would've seen
an angle on the video monitors.

37:13.043 --> 37:16.714
So if we can put you inside that
room, you can work on it all night.

37:18.883 --> 37:22.429
We'll need pictures of the safe
or a model number from their files.

37:22.512 --> 37:25.850
Then we're gonna need plans...
infrastructure maps...

37:25.933 --> 37:29.103
blueprints, schematics,
anything we can get our hands on.

37:29.187 --> 37:31.064
That's all I got for now,
but give me two days.

37:31.147 --> 37:33.608
We just gotta find a way
to get into that basement.

38:16.075 --> 38:18.202
You gonna let it go, or are we gonna
drive around pissed all night?

38:18.286 --> 38:19.954
Why don't you kiss my ass?

38:44.733 --> 38:48.278
- We're about set up. You ready?
- Hold on.

39:05.089 --> 39:07.885
- Wanna give me a mark?
- Not yet. Not yet.

39:20.775 --> 39:22.485
How you doing?

39:22.568 --> 39:25.029
Stay off the air until I call.

39:49.015 --> 39:51.393
Three-three, two-six...

39:51.476 --> 39:53.854
two-nine, three-two.

39:53.896 --> 39:59.570
I repeat: 33, 26, 29, 32.

39:59.653 --> 40:03.741
Copy that. Three-three, two-six,
two-nine, three-two.

40:07.787 --> 40:11.542
Make a right.
Proceed east about 20 yards.

40:11.625 --> 40:13.544
You should see
the next opening.

40:22.179 --> 40:24.557
I'm at a wall here,
a cinder block wall...

40:24.640 --> 40:26.434
where you told me I have to go.

40:26.517 --> 40:28.798
Are you sure about that?
It shows a straight shot on here.

40:28.853 --> 40:31.481
It's not my imagination.
I'm right here in front of it.

40:31.564 --> 40:33.942
You wanna come down here
and see for yourself?

40:35.403 --> 40:38.239
Right. Okay, okay. Hold on.

40:40.575 --> 40:42.494
All right,
just give me a second.

40:45.330 --> 40:48.251
- Can you read me?
- Make a left. Go about 20 feet.

40:48.293 --> 40:49.878
You should run
into a parallel tunnel.

40:49.961 --> 40:52.422
Make a right. You'll be
right back on course.

40:56.135 --> 40:58.929
Take the tunnel
about 150yards due west.

40:58.971 --> 41:01.266
You'll reach a "T" junction.
Tell me when you're there.

41:01.350 --> 41:02.768
About 300yards.

41:02.851 --> 41:05.729
- Came to the end. Made a right.
- Head Northwest.

41:05.771 --> 41:07.565
Northeast.
Check that. Northeast.

41:07.606 --> 41:09.108
One second. Hold on.

41:10.151 --> 41:13.237
- Are you with me?
- Going west. Going west.

41:13.321 --> 41:18.119
- I'm going west. I'm in a circle.
- Make a right. Go 40yards east.

41:18.160 --> 41:22.123
Then make a left turn.
Go about...

41:22.206 --> 41:24.250
Make a right. Head back.

41:24.292 --> 41:26.754
You got maybe 500 yards to go.

41:34.012 --> 41:37.349
Straight ahead 20 feet, and you
should be dead under the room.

41:37.432 --> 41:39.018
The tunnel will keep on going.

41:39.102 --> 41:41.521
But look up.
You should see the access ladder.

41:48.111 --> 41:50.113
I'm at a shaft.
I'm gonna climb up.

42:02.336 --> 42:04.255
What are you doing?

42:05.007 --> 42:06.383
Still climbing.

42:27.365 --> 42:28.283
This looks like it.

44:02.351 --> 44:04.269
I'm done.

44:16.242 --> 44:18.160
What the hell is this?

44:23.958 --> 44:26.128
Hey, you got a utility crew
all over the entrance.

44:26.212 --> 44:28.130
You're gonna have to find
another way out.

45:02.419 --> 45:04.548
Where are you?

45:11.514 --> 45:13.891
I'm at De La Montagne
and Ottawa.

45:13.975 --> 45:15.977
Repeat:
De La Montagne and Ottawa.

45:16.018 --> 45:17.980
Got it. We're on our way.

45:24.821 --> 45:26.739
This should be it, right here.

45:27.991 --> 45:30.870
We're here.
I'm just trying to find you.

45:30.953 --> 45:33.372
There. He's right over there.

45:55.732 --> 45:57.526
Okay, you're all clear.

45:57.567 --> 45:59.528
I'm coming out.

46:43.912 --> 46:45.330
Hello.

46:46.958 --> 46:48.918
Anybody home?

47:07.982 --> 47:10.234
- Champagne.
- Yeah.

47:10.317 --> 47:12.487
- Nice touch.
- Nice dress.

47:12.571 --> 47:14.406
You like? Thank you.

47:16.742 --> 47:21.414
So, you asked me a question
a couple of days ago.

47:21.497 --> 47:23.958
And you gave it
some serious thought?

47:24.918 --> 47:26.837
Actually,
I forgot the question.

47:29.298 --> 47:31.801
Here's my answer.

47:31.884 --> 47:33.386
You're not holding up
your glass.

47:33.469 --> 47:34.804
I'm sorry.

47:37.098 --> 47:39.811
My father was a lawyer...
very smart man...

47:39.894 --> 47:43.231
and he would always say
that a deal is only good...

47:43.314 --> 47:47.152
if it leaves both parties feeling
as if they gave up something.

47:47.194 --> 47:50.405
Is an answer coming soon?
'Cause the glass is getting heavy.

47:52.492 --> 47:53.910
Okay.

47:55.078 --> 47:57.205
I will change my life...

47:57.289 --> 47:59.208
I will move here...

48:01.043 --> 48:02.378
I will love you...

48:04.047 --> 48:08.177
and believe that this is
the best decision that I've made.

48:09.928 --> 48:12.973
But I will not move here
if it means that one day...

48:13.057 --> 48:14.767
I might have to talk
to you through glass.

48:14.850 --> 48:17.271
I won't move here if it means
spending my nights worrying.

48:17.354 --> 48:22.902
So if you can promise me, as of
right now, that you're through...

48:24.153 --> 48:27.198
then we can drink
to making changes.

48:35.583 --> 48:38.545
I... I said you could drink now.

48:38.586 --> 48:39.671
I know.

48:39.754 --> 48:42.300
I wanna do all that.

48:43.926 --> 48:48.223
I just have to tell you
that I'm gonna do one more thing...

48:48.264 --> 48:50.392
- and that's it.
- Oh, fuck.

48:50.433 --> 48:52.936
Everything you said is great.
It's perfect.

48:52.978 --> 48:56.274
I just have one more thing
I have to do.

48:56.358 --> 48:59.027
You put that out there when you
knew you couldn't follow through.

48:59.111 --> 49:01.947
I put it out there because...
I am following through.

49:01.989 --> 49:03.949
- This is my last one. I promise.
- Sure it is.

49:04.032 --> 49:06.076
I promise you
it is my last one.

49:06.118 --> 49:08.789
Then quit. Quit now.

49:08.872 --> 49:11.959
- What does "one last one" mean?
- It means we don't need anything.

49:12.042 --> 49:15.921
I didn't need anything before,
and I don't need anything now...

49:15.963 --> 49:18.215
but what I wanted
was to be with you.

49:18.299 --> 49:21.845
And what I didn't need was exactly
this kind of painful bullshit.

49:21.929 --> 49:26.475
My life wasn't perfect before,
but at least we were clear.

49:29.228 --> 49:30.229
Give me some...

49:32.524 --> 49:34.485
I'll see you when I see you.

50:45.567 --> 50:47.861
Hey, what are you doing?

50:47.944 --> 50:50.698
Somebody put fingerprints
on my window, Danny.

50:50.782 --> 50:54.035
- You don't need to do it.
- I like a clean window, Danny.

50:54.119 --> 50:55.328
It's all right.

50:55.412 --> 50:58.582
We missed you last night.
You feeling better?

50:58.665 --> 51:00.125
- Yes, thank you.
- Sure?

51:00.209 --> 51:01.449
Yes, I'm okay.
Thank you, Danny.

51:01.502 --> 51:05.132
- Take your time. Okay, bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

51:05.215 --> 51:06.299
Bye.

51:23.361 --> 51:25.279
That's your safe.

51:30.494 --> 51:33.581
Traeger standing jeweler's safe,
this year's model.

51:33.664 --> 51:36.918
If it's new, it's gonna be tough
to get the schematics.

51:37.001 --> 51:39.003
I've got all this year's books.

51:39.045 --> 51:41.465
- Really?
- Yeah. What else?

51:41.549 --> 51:44.802
Okay, the system's
Ironclad Security.

51:44.886 --> 51:46.513
They're a big commercial
industrial outfit.

51:46.554 --> 51:48.890
They handle a lot
of the government buildings here.

51:48.932 --> 51:52.060
Now, this building's pretty old.
The lines are all over the place.

51:52.144 --> 51:55.148
They're easy to find. I can cut in
three or four different places...

51:55.231 --> 51:58.944
and let you in from there, but I
need the engineering pass codes.

51:59.027 --> 52:00.570
I've been looking.
They don't keep them in here.

52:00.654 --> 52:03.991
They'll be at Ironclad.
I don't know what to do.

52:04.074 --> 52:05.367
Okay.

52:07.036 --> 52:08.955
What, are you
calling someone now?

52:13.210 --> 52:16.005
- What? Who is this?
- It's me. Turn down the music.

52:18.758 --> 52:21.011
Hey, Nick, I am fucked up.

52:21.095 --> 52:23.430
My mother's totally
out of control.

52:23.514 --> 52:25.141
Listen. Listen carefully.

52:25.224 --> 52:26.892
Ironclad Security.

52:26.976 --> 52:29.020
- Big outfit.
- Yeah.

52:29.103 --> 52:31.606
I need engineering pass codes
for the customshouse.

52:31.689 --> 52:33.734
I don't know, man.
My concentration's shot.

52:33.776 --> 52:37.071
I haven't slept in, like, a month.
Wait. What customshouse?

52:37.780 --> 52:38.906
Montreal.

52:41.117 --> 52:42.827
You're not pissing
in our own pool, man.

52:42.911 --> 52:45.497
You have always said you were never
gonna do a job here in Montreal.

52:45.581 --> 52:48.251
- I know. I know. Can you do it?
- Steven!

52:48.293 --> 52:50.128
Who are you talking to
at this hour?

52:50.170 --> 52:54.341
I am having a fucking conversation
with a friend of mine, Mother!

52:55.133 --> 52:58.638
- Are you... Are you okay?
- She is a ghoul.

52:58.721 --> 53:01.141
Now, tell me
exactly what you want.

53:01.224 --> 53:05.187
Just one second. Here's someone
who can tell you what we need.

53:05.270 --> 53:07.648
Just tell him what you need.

53:07.731 --> 53:10.985
I need separate disarm and reset
master codes for the whole system...

53:11.026 --> 53:13.405
and I need the individual
sector bypass codes...

53:13.488 --> 53:17.076
so I can shut down one zone without
lighting off the whole board.

53:17.159 --> 53:19.203
- Okay?
- Yes.

53:20.997 --> 53:22.456
- You got that?
- Got it.

53:22.540 --> 53:25.127
Now, listen, I'm gonna
need this within 48 hours.

53:25.169 --> 53:27.004
If you do that,
I'll double your last price.

53:27.963 --> 53:30.675
Dude, give me a Kaypro 64
and a live dial tone...

53:30.758 --> 53:33.010
and I can do anything.

53:34.971 --> 53:37.892
Oh, now you are going to die.

53:39.310 --> 53:41.813
This is someone you work with?

53:41.854 --> 53:44.107
And you're giving me
a hard time.

54:15.059 --> 54:18.522
Thursday, 8:07a.m.

54:18.605 --> 54:21.567
Hi. I got your message.
One of the stewardesses is sick...

54:21.650 --> 54:24.779
so I have to cover for her
on a New York run.

54:24.862 --> 54:27.699
We have to talk when I come
through in a couple of days.

54:27.740 --> 54:29.702
Okay? Bye.

54:30.911 --> 54:32.830
End of messages.

54:42.842 --> 54:45.511
Just lock it.

54:45.595 --> 54:49.015
- You work here?
- No. Here.

54:57.025 --> 54:59.069
Come on.

54:59.152 --> 55:01.113
Come on.
Come on in.

55:16.881 --> 55:18.799
Want some coffee?

55:24.348 --> 55:28.019
Jeez. Is this
what we're dealing with?

55:32.399 --> 55:34.276
Page 720.

55:38.740 --> 55:43.787
- Where can I get one of these?
- You gotta know the right people.

55:43.870 --> 55:46.749
Traeger floor safe.
Here it is.

55:47.542 --> 55:50.462
Solid steel body.

55:50.545 --> 55:52.922
Filled door
with aluminum and cobalt.

55:53.840 --> 55:56.885
Half-inch hard plate.
Double dial.

55:58.721 --> 56:00.962
You're gonna need two,
three hours to drill through that.

56:00.974 --> 56:03.769
- You can't drill this.
- Why not?

56:03.852 --> 56:07.147
'Cause this is a newer model
and it's got these glass packs.

56:07.231 --> 56:10.526
See the glass pack here? See?

56:10.609 --> 56:13.780
Drill through that, the glass breaks
and those bolts spring into place.

56:13.864 --> 56:15.616
You're fucked. They're locked.
Forget it.

56:15.657 --> 56:17.952
You can't break it
with a bulldozer.

56:17.993 --> 56:20.621
I've never seen anything like that.
What do you have in mind?

56:20.704 --> 56:23.750
I don't know, but if somebody
built it, somebody can unbuild it.

56:34.804 --> 56:37.808
Yeah, see, when I shut this down,
you'll see this light go off...

56:37.850 --> 56:40.394
but up in the booth,
nothing will register.

56:43.731 --> 56:46.359
- Is that your box?
- That's it.

56:46.443 --> 56:48.445
That's a fucking monster.
That's three times the size of this.

56:48.528 --> 56:50.114
Even bigger than that.

56:50.156 --> 56:53.451
See that over there?

56:53.493 --> 56:56.496
You can see it better over here.

56:56.580 --> 56:59.624
That's an active infrared post.

56:59.666 --> 57:01.752
I don't know.
That wasn't on the system specs.

57:01.835 --> 57:05.257
That's gotta be some independent
loop they set up just in the cage.

57:06.216 --> 57:08.176
I'll take care of it.

57:14.225 --> 57:19.273
All right, just calm down, okay?
I'll be over in a few minutes.

57:20.274 --> 57:22.693
I gotta take care of something.
I'll drop you off.

57:47.847 --> 57:50.058
My mom's only out
for about a half an hour.

57:55.315 --> 57:58.777
I was cruising around Ironclad's
server at the root COBOL level...

57:58.860 --> 58:03.782
when someone counter-cracked me,
hacked into my machines, my data.

58:03.865 --> 58:05.701
For three minutes,
I was fully exposed.

58:05.784 --> 58:10.123
Now I have to fire wall my whole
operations all from scratch.

58:10.207 --> 58:13.752
- Can you tell me that in English?
- Sorry.

58:13.836 --> 58:16.714
I was a few keystrokes away from
pulling those engineering codes...

58:16.797 --> 58:18.925
when I bump into a guy
on the other end.

58:19.009 --> 58:21.845
- And what's on the other end?
- Ironclad's computers.

58:21.887 --> 58:24.056
My guess is he's some
low-level systems administrator.

58:24.139 --> 58:29.270
So, we switch to a private
chat room, and he sends me this.

58:31.189 --> 58:32.107
Can you believe that?

58:32.191 --> 58:35.361
The guy comes into my world
and calls me an asshole.

58:35.403 --> 58:38.489
- Can you get me the bypass codes?
- I type, " How much?" He types...

58:38.573 --> 58:40.366
" Engineering codes for
the customshouse basement?"

58:40.450 --> 58:42.535
I say, "You guessed it,
Blue's Clues."

58:42.577 --> 58:44.664
And he says, " Fuck you."
And I say, " No, fuck you."

58:44.747 --> 58:47.416
And he says, " No, fuck you."
I'm like, " No, fuck you."

58:47.500 --> 58:49.419
Then he's like, " No, fuck..."

58:49.460 --> 58:52.005
Can you get me the bypass codes?

58:53.256 --> 58:57.052
The guy wants 50 thou
in exchange for the codes.

58:57.135 --> 59:00.056
- Fifty thousand.
- Yes.

59:02.726 --> 59:04.144
Get the account number.

59:04.227 --> 59:06.313
I'll wire the money, and he'll
deliver the codes through you.

59:06.396 --> 59:07.898
Negative.
The guy won't go for a transfer.

59:07.981 --> 59:10.402
He wants cash
and he wants to do it in person.

59:11.736 --> 59:13.447
- Anything else?
- No.

59:13.530 --> 59:16.492
You set it up.
I'll let myself out.

59:16.575 --> 59:19.620
When this score's done, I'm gonna
brute this creep with everything.

59:19.703 --> 59:23.333
By the time I'm done with this fuck,
he won't be able to hide in Bolivia!

59:51.991 --> 59:55.120
Jesus.
Look at all these people.

59:55.161 --> 59:58.081
Who sets up a meeting
in a public park?

01:00:02.170 --> 01:00:04.965
- You see him?
- Still looking.

01:00:19.982 --> 01:00:23.402
Got him.
He brought backup.

01:00:25.029 --> 01:00:27.032
Okay, I got him.

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:42.675
Hey, how ya doing?
Good to see ya.

01:00:42.717 --> 01:00:45.803
Shake my hand. That's right.
You my guy?

01:00:45.887 --> 01:00:47.096
Yeah.

01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:50.308
- Who's this?
- Cousin.

01:00:50.392 --> 01:00:54.021
Cousin? Okay. See the guy
over my left shoulder...

01:00:54.063 --> 01:00:59.277
back there on the bench,
reading the paper, the big one?

01:00:59.361 --> 01:01:02.906
That's my cousin, okay?

01:01:02.989 --> 01:01:07.037
So we've all got family here,
which is nice, I think. Yeah? Okay.

01:01:07.078 --> 01:01:11.583
Let me give you that. Look inside
and make sure you're happy.

01:01:16.255 --> 01:01:17.548
No, don't take that out.

01:01:17.631 --> 01:01:20.719
Hey, man, don't give me orders.
I get orders all day, okay?

01:01:20.761 --> 01:01:22.888
Can't count the money
in a public place.

01:01:22.930 --> 01:01:25.224
That's why you don't
set a meeting in a park.

01:01:25.307 --> 01:01:27.143
Just for future reference.

01:01:28.269 --> 01:01:30.396
Just flip through it in the bag.

01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:34.193
We're about set to go here.
You ready?

01:01:34.276 --> 01:01:35.444
What the fuck is that?

01:01:35.528 --> 01:01:38.406
He's gonna give me the numbers, and
I'm gonna read 'em into this mike...

01:01:38.447 --> 01:01:40.450
to a friend of mine
who's gonna check 'em out.

01:01:43.954 --> 01:01:46.354
Did you think I was gonna
write it down on a cocktail napkin?

01:01:47.041 --> 01:01:50.086
- Okay, ready.
- Okay, you're on.

01:01:51.921 --> 01:01:55.592
First set: 3-1-7.

01:01:55.675 --> 01:01:58.763
- 3-1-7.
- Got it. 3-1-7.

01:01:58.805 --> 01:02:03.101
Steven, 3-1-7.

01:02:03.184 --> 01:02:05.729
Confirm 3-1-7.

01:02:10.819 --> 01:02:15.574
Just be a second.
Are you guys maternal cousins?

01:02:29.590 --> 01:02:32.385
- First numbers are clean.
- They're clean. They're clean.

01:02:32.468 --> 01:02:34.720
You tell the hack
at the other end of that wire...

01:02:34.804 --> 01:02:37.600
he tries to get in my system again,
I will fry him, okay?

01:02:37.683 --> 01:02:39.518
Why don't we worry about
next time next time, okay?

01:02:39.602 --> 01:02:41.646
Let's get this done before
people start looking at us.

01:02:41.687 --> 01:02:44.816
- Give me the second set.
- 9-4-6.

01:02:44.899 --> 01:02:47.819
- 9-4-6.
- 9-4-6.

01:02:47.861 --> 01:02:51.949
Repeat: 9-4-6. 9-4-6.

01:02:58.707 --> 01:03:01.669
- Take it easy. Relax. Have a smoke.
- I don't smoke.

01:03:01.711 --> 01:03:05.799
Me either, so good for us.
You guys local? You live here?

01:03:05.882 --> 01:03:08.593
Why are you asking
so many fucking questions?

01:03:13.933 --> 01:03:17.187
- They're good.
- Second set is good.

01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:18.772
What's the third one?

01:03:21.108 --> 01:03:23.068
5-8-3-9.

01:03:23.110 --> 01:03:25.321
5-8-3-9.

01:03:25.404 --> 01:03:27.866
5-8-3-9. Got it.

01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:31.453
5-8-3-9.

01:03:40.923 --> 01:03:43.217
This is taking too long.
I'm gonna fucking lose it.

01:03:43.259 --> 01:03:45.094
Shut up, Eric.

01:03:45.178 --> 01:03:48.348
They have to verify the numbers
off the server. It takes some time.

01:03:48.431 --> 01:03:49.933
Just relax, Eric.

01:03:53.479 --> 01:03:55.398
Can you help me out? It's turning
into amateur hour out here.

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:58.151
- Fuck you, asshole.
- What are you doing?

01:03:58.234 --> 01:03:59.736
One of them has a gun.

01:03:59.819 --> 01:04:01.905
Burt, big guy's got a gun.

01:04:01.988 --> 01:04:03.740
Steven, how's it going?
We're losing these guys.

01:04:03.824 --> 01:04:06.744
- I'm working it, man.
- Steven, want some lunch?

01:04:06.786 --> 01:04:09.164
I'm on the phone, bitch!

01:04:09.247 --> 01:04:10.415
- You all right?
- We're fine.

01:04:10.499 --> 01:04:15.337
Don't anybody move.
Eric, look at my hand right now.

01:04:17.172 --> 01:04:21.011
If you take that out, I'm gonna take
this out, be a big fucking mess.

01:04:21.970 --> 01:04:23.597
Put it away, Eric.

01:04:23.639 --> 01:04:25.766
There's kids all around.
What are you thinking?

01:04:25.849 --> 01:04:30.731
Put it away. Take a deep breath
and just put it in your back pocket.

01:04:30.814 --> 01:04:33.025
Put it away.

01:04:36.695 --> 01:04:39.198
- They're all good.
- Last set of numbers confirmed.

01:04:39.282 --> 01:04:41.362
Last set of numbers confirmed.
Let's get out of here.

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:53.339
Next time, don't bring a gun.

01:04:53.381 --> 01:04:57.094
Listen, I thought
I might need one, and I did.

01:04:57.178 --> 01:04:59.305
- Now we've got the codes.
- Don't bring a gun.

01:05:08.398 --> 01:05:11.611
I called. They said you hadn't
checked in yet. No.

01:05:16.742 --> 01:05:19.078
So what time you getting in?

01:05:21.455 --> 01:05:23.750
Come on, honey.
Don't stay at a hotel.

01:05:23.834 --> 01:05:26.378
Just come over to my place.
I'll cook some...

01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:39.894
Yeah. Yeah.

01:05:39.977 --> 01:05:42.396
I was just saying come to my place.
I'll cook something.

01:05:42.438 --> 01:05:44.482
You know, we'll talk, okay?

01:05:48.571 --> 01:05:51.365
I'm thinking 'bout a place

01:05:51.449 --> 01:05:54.118
I'm waiting for the day

01:05:54.202 --> 01:05:58.623
When I will make my getaway

01:05:59.749 --> 01:06:02.879
Because as any fool can see

01:06:02.962 --> 01:06:05.423
There's nothing here for me

01:06:05.507 --> 01:06:09.219
But hurry up, boy
bring that water

01:06:09.302 --> 01:06:11.722
Don't do things
you shouldn't oughta

01:06:11.805 --> 01:06:13.683
He's good.

01:06:15.477 --> 01:06:18.313
When you gotta be there?

01:06:18.397 --> 01:06:22.443
I'll go in in a couple hours.
I'm okay. I'm doing fine.

01:06:23.819 --> 01:06:26.656
Listen, tell me something.
Tell me something.

01:06:26.698 --> 01:06:28.951
All the years
you've been doing this...

01:06:28.992 --> 01:06:31.370
what's the biggest gamble
you ever took?

01:06:31.453 --> 01:06:35.124
On the job.
You know, biggest long shot.

01:06:35.207 --> 01:06:37.418
I don't take long shots.

01:06:37.502 --> 01:06:40.005
I know you're careful.
You know, I'm careful too.

01:06:40.089 --> 01:06:42.675
That's not what I mean.
I mean...

01:06:42.758 --> 01:06:45.303
When you were starting out,
when you were just getting going...

01:06:45.344 --> 01:06:48.222
you must have taken
some fliers here and there.

01:06:48.306 --> 01:06:50.391
Done something that was
a little wild. I'm just curious.

01:06:50.475 --> 01:06:52.311
Never took long shots.

01:06:56.149 --> 01:06:57.734
I'm gonna say something to you.

01:06:57.817 --> 01:06:59.903
You're smart, you're talented
and you know a few things...

01:06:59.986 --> 01:07:03.156
but talent means nothing
if you don't make the right choices.

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:06.661
There's talented people out there
who never see daylight anymore.

01:07:06.703 --> 01:07:08.955
Last thing, it takes discipline...

01:07:09.039 --> 01:07:10.999
because this whole game
is one big long shot...

01:07:11.082 --> 01:07:13.335
and if you don't have the discipline
to stay away from the fliers...

01:07:13.377 --> 01:07:16.380
or from the gambles or whatever else
you wanna call a stupid move...

01:07:16.463 --> 01:07:19.718
then, my friend, I'm afraid to say,
one day you will go down.

01:07:19.801 --> 01:07:21.303
It's inevitable.

01:07:22.095 --> 01:07:24.389
You want my advice?

01:07:24.556 --> 01:07:26.433
Make a list of everything
you want now...

01:07:26.517 --> 01:07:29.729
and plan on spending the next
25 years of your life getting it.

01:07:29.812 --> 01:07:32.691
Slowly, piece by piece.

01:07:40.116 --> 01:07:41.617
I see what you're saying.

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:47.583
But still, I'm looking at you,
and you got all this already...

01:07:47.625 --> 01:07:50.253
and you're sitting here with me,
working with a partner...

01:07:50.336 --> 01:07:53.381
in the city where you live, on a job
that's gotten more complicated...

01:07:53.465 --> 01:07:55.927
than you thought it was gonna be.

01:07:55.968 --> 01:07:58.471
So I know you're still
taking a shot at something.

01:08:04.394 --> 01:08:06.605
I gotta go.

01:08:08.398 --> 01:08:10.610
See ya tomorrow.

01:08:17.826 --> 01:08:19.828
The maintenance crews
come in the tunnels by 6a. m.

01:08:19.870 --> 01:08:21.831
I gotta be back in the hole by 5:30.

01:08:21.915 --> 01:08:24.292
As soon as the guards leave,
you gotta tell me right away.

01:08:24.334 --> 01:08:26.587
- You can't be late.
- I'm not worried about my end.

01:08:26.670 --> 01:08:31.634
I'm wondering how you're gonna
break that safe in half an hour.

01:08:31.716 --> 01:08:33.469
You know, I mean...

01:08:52.366 --> 01:08:55.745
- Is that even possible?
- Just physics.

01:09:00.209 --> 01:09:03.212
- How long is that gonna take?
- Twelve, fifteen minutes, tops.

01:09:03.254 --> 01:09:05.381
Fifteen minutes, tops?

01:09:07.175 --> 01:09:10.220
Okay. Okay.

01:09:10.303 --> 01:09:14.475
Then if you're on the box by 5:00,
the prize goes in the bag by 5: 1 5.

01:09:14.559 --> 01:09:17.854
- You got no problem at all.
- 5: 1 5, 5:30, I'm back in the hole.

01:09:17.895 --> 01:09:21.191
- You reset the system.
- That's perfect.

01:09:21.274 --> 01:09:23.359
I'll pack up my shit.
I can meet you here.

01:09:23.444 --> 01:09:26.698
- We can go to Max, or I can...
- We're not gonna meet back here.

01:09:26.782 --> 01:09:29.368
- I'll meet you at Max's, then.
- No.

01:09:29.451 --> 01:09:32.496
You'll finish out your shift.
I go to Max. He does his thing.

01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:34.381
He pays us off.
We never see each other again.

01:09:34.457 --> 01:09:37.460
Forget it. Just forget it.
I'm gonna come with you to Max's.

01:09:37.542 --> 01:09:40.171
- We'll deliver it together.
- No, you're not.

01:09:40.255 --> 01:09:43.216
Listen. I've done this
down to the last detail.

01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:45.761
Don't put me on the sideline
when it's time to collect.

01:09:45.845 --> 01:09:48.221
- Don't do it.
- Listen to me.

01:09:48.264 --> 01:09:50.600
You do anything out of the ordinary,
you're gonna get made.

01:09:50.683 --> 01:09:54.689
Do you understand that?
Be smart. Finish out your shift.

01:09:59.444 --> 01:10:01.571
- You're the boss.
- Okay.

01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:19.301
Steven got these from a supplier.
They're throwaways.

01:10:19.384 --> 01:10:21.094
Totally untraceable.

01:10:25.391 --> 01:10:28.853
People are talking. They say Max
is in trouble with Teddy Salida...

01:10:28.936 --> 01:10:31.899
and he's pulling off a big job
to get rid of him.

01:10:33.734 --> 01:10:35.653
That's what they say?

01:10:37.321 --> 01:10:39.907
Maybe you should
walk away from this one.

01:12:07.384 --> 01:12:09.344
What are you doing down here?

01:12:09.386 --> 01:12:12.515
Jesus Christ,
you scared the shit out of me.

01:12:12.599 --> 01:12:16.311
What the hell are you
doing down here?

01:12:16.353 --> 01:12:19.022
Did you involve
Teddy Salida in this?

01:12:19.106 --> 01:12:22.443
- What? Teddy Salida?
- Yeah.

01:12:23.026 --> 01:12:26.031
- Why would you say that?
- I see these guys outside.

01:12:26.114 --> 01:12:28.659
They look like
they might be with him.

01:12:30.244 --> 01:12:32.204
How much you into him for?

01:12:32.788 --> 01:12:34.206
Four million.

01:12:35.875 --> 01:12:37.376
Look, how do you think
I got all this?

01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:39.838
They gave it to me
and the house in Bermuda?

01:12:39.922 --> 01:12:42.216
What's the matter with you?

01:12:42.883 --> 01:12:45.386
What's he know?

01:12:45.469 --> 01:12:48.514
- About what?
- About what we're doing.

01:12:49.557 --> 01:12:52.853
Nothing. I told him I found
something that would go for eight...

01:12:52.895 --> 01:12:56.107
and that we'd
split the profits, that's all.

01:12:57.233 --> 01:12:59.527
What are you actually
selling the scepter for, Max?

01:13:01.946 --> 01:13:04.700
$30 million.

01:13:05.702 --> 01:13:09.289
Jesus.
Max, what were you thinking?

01:13:09.372 --> 01:13:11.291
What was I thinking?
The same thing you were thinking.

01:13:11.374 --> 01:13:16.548
How are we gonna get out from under
all this bullshit we've been living?

01:13:16.589 --> 01:13:19.718
The chance came. Took it.

01:13:19.801 --> 01:13:22.804
- It's gonna work out fine.
- No, it's not.

01:13:22.888 --> 01:13:25.474
- What do you mean, it's not?
- It's not. It's a mess.

01:13:25.557 --> 01:13:29.062
- It's not gonna work.
- Wait. Wait a fucking minute.

01:13:29.146 --> 01:13:33.317
This is absolutely clean, Nick.
What are you worried about?

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:36.320
Jesus Christ, it's my ass
on the line anyway, not yours.

01:13:36.403 --> 01:13:38.489
I'm not taking
the biggest gamble of my life...

01:13:38.572 --> 01:13:40.575
so I can hand my money over
to Teddy Salida.

01:13:40.616 --> 01:13:43.829
You think you're not gonna get
your fucking money?

01:13:43.912 --> 01:13:45.664
Look, there's two things
you gotta know.

01:13:45.748 --> 01:13:48.918
One is you're gonna get
every fucking red cent.

01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:52.255
And, yeah,
Teddy knows a little.

01:13:52.296 --> 01:13:54.424
- He knows?
- He does a little, I said.

01:13:54.507 --> 01:13:58.262
- So you did lie?
- Yeah, lied! Shit happens, man!

01:13:58.304 --> 01:14:00.223
Christ Almighty!

01:14:00.306 --> 01:14:02.308
I lied for you and I lied for me.

01:14:02.392 --> 01:14:05.896
I had to say something
to get you to suit up, like always.

01:14:10.610 --> 01:14:12.487
I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna do it.

01:14:14.656 --> 01:14:17.784
It's a tiny door. Open the door.
Take the shit.

01:14:17.868 --> 01:14:19.828
Close the door. We're out.

01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:22.457
There's too much bullshit
around it.

01:14:39.393 --> 01:14:41.187
What's that?

01:14:53.367 --> 01:14:55.203
The buyer.

01:14:56.829 --> 01:14:59.709
Real simple. You call him
when you get the scepter.

01:15:00.418 --> 01:15:03.338
He'll meet you at the airstrip
30 miles up the St. Lawrence.

01:15:03.379 --> 01:15:07.175
There's a little town called
St. Croix.

01:15:08.718 --> 01:15:11.388
You give him the scepter,
he gives you the cash.

01:15:11.471 --> 01:15:14.893
You take your cut
and you wire me the rest.

01:15:14.934 --> 01:15:18.522
I'll give Teddy his,
and you're clean.

01:15:22.901 --> 01:15:25.447
It's too risky.

01:15:25.530 --> 01:15:27.491
Can't.

01:15:30.744 --> 01:15:33.539
You don't know
what you're doing.

01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:36.333
You know how long we go back?

01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:39.922
Twenty-five years.

01:15:42.383 --> 01:15:45.386
I'm gonna tell you something.

01:15:45.469 --> 01:15:49.599
For the first time in my life,
I'm scared.

01:15:49.682 --> 01:15:52.144
I don't know why it is.
I was never scared before...

01:15:52.228 --> 01:15:55.022
but I'm scared now, Nick.

01:15:55.106 --> 01:15:59.235
And you're right about Teddy.
He's gonna blow me away if he can.

01:15:59.319 --> 01:16:01.404
If I don't get him his money, he...

01:16:02.447 --> 01:16:04.826
Man, he...

01:16:07.412 --> 01:16:11.958
Hey, don't-don't-don't-don't
let me slide on this one.

01:16:12.042 --> 01:16:14.378
I can't afford it, man.

01:16:20.135 --> 01:16:23.805
I can't...
I can't scrap it out anymore.

01:16:23.889 --> 01:16:26.308
I gotta have some slack.

01:16:31.523 --> 01:16:33.525
All right. Okay.

01:16:35.819 --> 01:16:37.947
I hope you're not fucking me up.

01:16:54.425 --> 01:16:56.469
I'm going down to check the power.

01:17:04.018 --> 01:17:07.815
- How much more equipment you got?
- Here you go.

01:17:12.612 --> 01:17:14.322
- Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!
- It's okay, Brian.

01:17:14.406 --> 01:17:16.658
- Come on in.
- It's my radio.

01:17:16.741 --> 01:17:18.910
- Hey, what's all the commotion?
- Don't worry, Danny.

01:17:18.994 --> 01:17:21.122
- They're beefing things up.
- What for?

01:17:21.206 --> 01:17:23.847
- A few cameras in the basement.
- Like we're gonna lose it, right?

01:17:23.875 --> 01:17:26.294
- Lose what?
- That thing in the piano leg.

01:17:26.378 --> 01:17:30.299
- The big gold thing?
- Some French national treasure.

01:17:30.382 --> 01:17:34.471
- It's called a scepter.
- Some expert saw those pictures.

01:17:34.554 --> 01:17:38.058
Now we're getting calls
from the central office.

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:44.857
Hey, it's me.
Yeah, we got a problem.

01:17:44.899 --> 01:17:48.779
They got a camera over
the main door here, covering that.

01:17:48.862 --> 01:17:52.033
They got a camera here,
looking right across the middle.

01:17:52.074 --> 01:17:55.161
They got one special
just on the box...

01:17:55.244 --> 01:17:57.539
sees this entire cage.

01:17:58.916 --> 01:18:01.043
This camera looking at the box...

01:18:01.085 --> 01:18:03.838
how high is it from the floor
and how low is it from the ceiling?

01:18:03.921 --> 01:18:07.550
Probably 1 0, 1 2 feet up
off the floor.

01:18:07.634 --> 01:18:11.097
Four feet down from the ceiling.
I think we're fucked.

01:18:13.433 --> 01:18:16.102
So let me...

01:18:16.186 --> 01:18:18.522
When I'm here...

01:18:18.605 --> 01:18:21.566
you'll cut the feed when I get
across here, then you'll restore it.

01:18:21.608 --> 01:18:23.694
Then when I'm ready here,
you'll cut it again...

01:18:23.777 --> 01:18:26.072
and I'll go to work here.

01:18:27.157 --> 01:18:29.034
I don't know about that, man.

01:18:29.117 --> 01:18:31.411
They know what it is so now they're
gonna move it as soon as they can.

01:18:31.453 --> 01:18:36.041
We're not gonna get another chance.
We gotta go now or we don't go at all.

01:20:03.726 --> 01:20:05.729
Hi, Doug. Hi.

01:20:14.698 --> 01:20:17.075
- Hi, Henri.
- Hi, Brian.

01:20:20.914 --> 01:20:23.708
- Okay. Thank you.
- No problem.

01:20:23.792 --> 01:20:26.420
- Hi, Danny.
- Hello, Brian.

01:20:26.503 --> 01:20:31.008
Oh, look at you.
What fancy new shoes.

01:20:31.091 --> 01:20:33.845
Yeah. Yeah, my mom
got those for me.

01:20:33.929 --> 01:20:38.434
- Oh, your mom gave you those?
- I think you got a girl.

01:20:38.475 --> 01:20:40.978
No girl, Danny.
You're a stinker.

01:20:41.645 --> 01:20:44.816
Well, you and your new shoes can
give me a hand up on six tonight.

01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:47.986
We're gonna wax
the whole cafeteria floor.

01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:50.114
You hit the garbage.
I'll get the stuff.

01:20:50.155 --> 01:20:52.700
I'll meet you there,
what, 1 5 minutes.

01:20:52.783 --> 01:20:54.744
Fifteen. Okay.

01:20:54.827 --> 01:21:00.459
Okay, I'll get the garbage, Danny.
Okay? Bye-bye, Andre.

01:21:00.543 --> 01:21:02.295
Bye-bye.
You look good with those shoes.

01:21:02.378 --> 01:21:05.048
Yeah, thanks. I know.

01:21:27.949 --> 01:21:29.910
Watch your step out there, Brian.

01:21:29.993 --> 01:21:31.954
I will. Thank you.

01:25:41.660 --> 01:25:44.329
Okay. Okay, Danny.

01:25:44.413 --> 01:25:47.541
- Guess what time it is.
- I don't know.

01:25:47.625 --> 01:25:49.919
Yes, you do, Danny!
It's lunchtime!

01:25:50.002 --> 01:25:52.129
All right, I'll tell you what.

01:25:52.213 --> 01:25:55.050
What do you say we keep on working,
finish the other side, hmm?

01:25:55.134 --> 01:25:57.595
No, Danny. Why?

01:25:57.678 --> 01:26:00.890
Then we can blow off the rest of
the day and grab some pancakes.

01:26:00.973 --> 01:26:04.060
It won't take us long. Just throw
a little extra thinner into the mix.

01:26:04.143 --> 01:26:07.189
It'll go like butter.

01:26:54.952 --> 01:26:56.830
Danny, I am sorry.

01:26:56.914 --> 01:26:59.083
It's okay. Just leave it.
I'll mop it up.

01:26:59.124 --> 01:27:01.252
- I'll go get some more.
- You don't need to...

01:27:01.335 --> 01:27:03.963
- I will get some more.
- All right.

01:27:04.046 --> 01:27:06.132
- You know where? Ground floor?
- Okay.

01:27:06.215 --> 01:27:08.259
You know the closet?

01:27:12.473 --> 01:27:14.809
Set to go. Set to go.

01:27:30.619 --> 01:27:32.162
Fuck.

01:27:36.209 --> 01:27:39.212
Are you there?
I'm on my mark.

01:27:46.804 --> 01:27:49.141
- I'm on. Are you there?
- I'm here. We're running late.

01:27:49.224 --> 01:27:50.684
I know. I hit a snag.

01:27:52.686 --> 01:27:55.648
I'm already all set up, though.
Just give me one second.

01:28:01.864 --> 01:28:05.409
All right, I just gotta punch in
these codes. Just sit tight.

01:28:25.599 --> 01:28:26.893
I got it.

01:28:26.976 --> 01:28:29.354
Hang on one more beat.

01:28:39.699 --> 01:28:41.493
It's clear.
Get in there.

01:29:08.649 --> 01:29:12.570
I'm inside the first cage.
Repeat: I am inside the first cage.

01:29:20.329 --> 01:29:21.789
You're all clear.

01:30:35.375 --> 01:30:39.129
- I'm set. Kill it.
- All right, on my mark.

01:30:51.059 --> 01:30:52.227
Go.

01:30:56.607 --> 01:30:57.733
I'm here.

01:30:59.527 --> 01:31:01.447
There we go.

01:31:01.530 --> 01:31:03.908
Perfect. Tell me when
you're in second position.

01:33:45.052 --> 01:33:46.930
Fuck.

01:34:30.647 --> 01:34:33.316
- How ya doing down there?
- Almost there.

01:34:50.794 --> 01:34:52.798
Do you know where is Brian?

01:34:54.007 --> 01:34:55.759
No idea.

01:35:54.995 --> 01:35:55.787
I'm ready.

01:35:56.538 --> 01:35:59.833
I need a second here.
Hold on.

01:36:00.417 --> 01:36:02.878
I'm all set. Cut the cameras.
Repeat:

01:36:02.962 --> 01:36:05.214
I'm all set.
Cut the cameras.

01:36:08.552 --> 01:36:10.679
Gotta go. Got to go.

01:36:13.975 --> 01:36:16.060
What's up? What's up?

01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:20.065
I got company.
I got company.

01:36:22.026 --> 01:36:24.028
Hang on one second.

01:36:24.112 --> 01:36:25.863
Just sit tight.
I'll be right back.

01:36:57.983 --> 01:36:59.820
Okay.

01:37:16.714 --> 01:37:18.716
Jack, where are you?

01:37:23.179 --> 01:37:25.641
Jack, come in. Jack.

01:37:41.326 --> 01:37:43.829
Jack, are you there?

01:38:04.770 --> 01:38:06.772
I'm pulling out.
Repeat: I'm pulling out.

01:38:06.814 --> 01:38:08.774
- I'm back. I'm back.
- It's too late.

01:38:08.816 --> 01:38:11.110
- I'm pulling out.
- No, it's not. We're good.

01:38:11.193 --> 01:38:12.862
Get ready to go.

01:38:14.530 --> 01:38:15.991
On my mark.

01:38:20.204 --> 01:38:21.330
Go, go, go.

01:38:35.805 --> 01:38:37.766
What the hell's wrong
with these machines?

01:38:50.405 --> 01:38:53.409
Hey, stop banging on it.
Check the connection.

01:39:14.725 --> 01:39:18.062
- You see something?
- I don't know.

01:39:36.918 --> 01:39:39.337
Call them.
Call Ironclad.

01:39:40.088 --> 01:39:43.175
- And look like idiots?
- I don't care. Call them.

01:40:38.781 --> 01:40:41.493
Maybe it's some of the equipment
down in the basement.

01:40:43.829 --> 01:40:45.831
Okay. Thanks.

01:40:47.541 --> 01:40:50.170
Someone will be here
in a few minutes.

01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:38.725
Where are you, kid?

01:43:24.974 --> 01:43:27.977
Make a move, make a sound,
and you are dead.

01:43:28.060 --> 01:43:30.104
Do you understand me?

01:43:32.023 --> 01:43:33.608
Turn around.

01:43:38.156 --> 01:43:39.699
Be quiet.

01:43:54.132 --> 01:43:56.093
I wish you had not
come down here, man.

01:43:59.930 --> 01:44:04.061
Get over there. Turn around.
Come on. Let's go. Turn around.

01:44:04.144 --> 01:44:08.023
Walk over there.
Open the door.

01:44:08.107 --> 01:44:10.151
Open it.

01:44:10.192 --> 01:44:12.111
Get inside.

01:44:14.197 --> 01:44:16.116
Look at me.

01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:18.661
You're a good man.
I don't want to hurt you.

01:44:18.702 --> 01:44:21.622
But if you start making noise or
try to open that door, I will do it.

01:44:21.706 --> 01:44:23.207
Do you understand me?

01:44:25.585 --> 01:44:28.673
Stay in there and be quiet.
Everything will be fine.

01:45:32.079 --> 01:45:33.915
I don't wanna wait.

01:45:33.956 --> 01:45:36.751
I want you and Tommy
to go into the basement now.

01:45:36.793 --> 01:45:39.087
Come on, Andre.
I'm watching this.

01:45:39.170 --> 01:45:40.964
Laurent, please.

01:45:42.966 --> 01:45:46.262
Tommy, get Philippe. We're gonna be
checking out the basement again.

01:46:30.772 --> 01:46:32.607
Hold it right there!

01:46:32.690 --> 01:46:34.901
- Are you crazy?
- Take it off and put it down.

01:46:34.985 --> 01:46:38.948
- Aw, come on.
- Take it off and put it down now!

01:46:39.032 --> 01:46:42.410
- Don't do this.
- Take it off and put it down!

01:46:42.494 --> 01:46:44.454
- Please, don't...
- Don't fucking argue with me.

01:46:44.538 --> 01:46:47.207
Take it off and put it down.

01:46:47.290 --> 01:46:48.918
I can't. I can't.

01:46:50.211 --> 01:46:53.381
I'll put the next one in your knee.
I don't have time to fuck around.

01:46:53.465 --> 01:46:56.760
We can work out the details later.
I am leaving with that scepter.

01:46:58.053 --> 01:47:02.142
Now, take it off
and hand it over right now!

01:47:09.358 --> 01:47:12.945
Put it down. Slowly.

01:47:13.654 --> 01:47:15.949
Now, step back.
Back up.

01:47:24.876 --> 01:47:26.836
- Take off your mask.
- What?

01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:28.422
Take it off!

01:47:30.049 --> 01:47:33.386
I don't have time to play games.
Take it off.

01:47:45.734 --> 01:47:47.652
Throw it over there.

01:47:49.821 --> 01:47:51.990
Step in the middle.

01:47:52.074 --> 01:47:54.411
Step in the middle.
That's right.

01:47:58.081 --> 01:48:02.127
We wouldn't be here if you'd thrown
me some respect at the beginning.

01:48:02.211 --> 01:48:04.171
- Just a little bit.
- This is a stupid move.

01:48:04.255 --> 01:48:05.799
- It is? Why?
- We all come out ahead.

01:48:05.882 --> 01:48:08.343
What are you doing?
Just go up there and finish...

01:48:08.427 --> 01:48:10.028
It's a long shot.
I should play it tight.

01:48:10.053 --> 01:48:11.972
You know what I think
of your bullshit advice?

01:48:12.056 --> 01:48:15.184
I think that's you trying to talk me
into taking a sucker's share...

01:48:15.267 --> 01:48:18.522
on a score that I set up
from the beginning!

01:48:20.024 --> 01:48:24.070
You think I'm stupid, that I don't
see what you and Max are doing?

01:48:25.738 --> 01:48:29.409
I mean, what is he giving you?
Five, six million?

01:48:29.492 --> 01:48:31.912
Tell me that's not true.

01:48:31.996 --> 01:48:34.207
See, that doesn't work for me.

01:48:35.833 --> 01:48:40.672
I appreciate your help,
but you should've made me a partner.

01:48:40.755 --> 01:48:42.799
Now I gotta take a shot.

01:48:48.515 --> 01:48:52.018
Just sit tight. Just sit tight.
Everything will be fine.

01:48:56.023 --> 01:48:59.611
Now you got a choice. You can
either head for that tunnel...

01:48:59.694 --> 01:49:01.571
or smile for that camera.

01:49:10.165 --> 01:49:11.708
Andre, what's happening?

01:49:11.792 --> 01:49:13.419
Get down!
Go to the basement!

01:49:13.502 --> 01:49:16.088
We're being robbed!
We're being robbed!

01:49:21.093 --> 01:49:24.098
Henri, quick! Go outside!
Wait for the police!

01:49:31.648 --> 01:49:33.399
Let's go!
Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:50:04.811 --> 01:50:06.897
Over here! Over here!

01:50:11.068 --> 01:50:15.282
- He's in the tunnel!
- Where is he?

01:50:17.660 --> 01:50:19.119
Find him!

01:50:36.014 --> 01:50:38.141
- Back there!
- Okay!

01:50:38.224 --> 01:50:40.228
Come on! Come on! Come on!

01:51:24.236 --> 01:51:26.948
- Andre!
- Oh, shit.

01:51:27.031 --> 01:51:29.117
- Andre, is there a fire?
- It's okay.

01:51:33.039 --> 01:51:34.957
- Where's Danny?
- Just get out!

01:51:35.041 --> 01:51:37.418
- Okay.
- Just wait outside.

01:51:40.964 --> 01:51:44.427
- Just wait outside!
- Okay, bye-bye.

01:51:47.555 --> 01:51:49.891
Wait, Brian, wait!

01:51:49.933 --> 01:51:51.726
Get back, Brian!

01:51:54.271 --> 01:51:57.025
It's Brian! It's Brian!

01:51:57.108 --> 01:52:00.904
- Have you seen Brian?
- He's okay! He's outside!

01:52:00.987 --> 01:52:03.198
No! My God, it's him!

01:52:05.284 --> 01:52:08.037
It's okay now.
It's okay.

01:54:39.921 --> 01:54:43.759
Attention. The bus to Albany,
New York leaves in five...

01:54:45.762 --> 01:54:46.763
Yeah?

01:54:46.846 --> 01:54:49.099
- Hey, did you make it?
- Fuck you.

01:54:50.517 --> 01:54:52.477
Come on. I'm just checking
to make sure you got out okay.

01:54:52.519 --> 01:54:54.479
I knew you'd give 'em the slip.

01:54:55.689 --> 01:54:57.650
I'm almost home, too, here,
by the way.

01:54:57.734 --> 01:54:59.527
Oh, you are, huh?
You sure about that?

01:54:59.611 --> 01:55:03.073
Look, whatever you're thinking
about, just forget it, okay?

01:55:03.156 --> 01:55:05.159
This is over now
and you just gotta deal with it.

01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:08.747
It's not over yet 'cause you don't
know where you're going, and I do.

01:55:08.830 --> 01:55:10.749
- You don't know shit!
- You know where you're going?

01:55:10.832 --> 01:55:15.421
I'm five minutes from being gone.
You can't imagine where I'm going.

01:55:15.504 --> 01:55:18.257
- You got nothing.
- You know what I got.

01:55:18.340 --> 01:55:20.468
You just can't deal with the fact
that I beat you.

01:55:20.551 --> 01:55:24.640
Oh, yeah? What have you got?
Huh? What have you got?

01:55:24.723 --> 01:55:26.767
You know what I've got.

01:55:55.759 --> 01:55:57.010
Let me ask you something.

01:55:57.094 --> 01:56:00.515
When did you start thinking
you were better than me, huh?

01:56:00.598 --> 01:56:01.766
You still there, ace?

01:56:03.518 --> 01:56:06.521
Okay. Nicely done.

01:56:06.605 --> 01:56:09.233
Nicely done.
Now let's talk about this.

01:56:09.316 --> 01:56:11.756
Okay, let's see. How'd you put it?
" Deal with it. It's over."

01:56:11.777 --> 01:56:14.906
No, I don't think so. You want me
to list the ways I can burn you?

01:56:14.948 --> 01:56:18.118
We either work this out right now,
or I will take you down.

01:56:18.202 --> 01:56:21.622
Oh, yeah? How?
My shop, my tools, they're gone.

01:56:21.705 --> 01:56:24.458
Me, my friend, I'm just
a taxpaying jazz club owner.

01:56:24.542 --> 01:56:27.546
You? Every cop in the city's
looking for you right about now.

01:56:28.297 --> 01:56:31.592
So if I were you, I'd quit
making threats and hit the road.

01:56:35.555 --> 01:56:37.599
Nice working with you, ace.

01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:39.935
Okay, bye-bye.

01:57:12.848 --> 01:57:15.726
Montreal was stunned
by the daring predawn robbery...

01:57:15.768 --> 01:57:18.647
of the old city's historic
customshouse.

01:57:18.730 --> 01:57:22.276
A priceless scepter was stolen.
A senior night janitor...

01:57:22.359 --> 01:57:24.278
identified this man...

01:57:24.361 --> 01:57:26.280
as the prime suspect
in the burglary.

01:57:26.364 --> 01:57:29.575
He was spotted leaving the scene
moments after the robbery...

01:57:29.660 --> 01:57:32.121
and is now the focus
of a massive manhunt.

01:57:32.163 --> 01:57:35.917
A second suspect vanished
from the scene without a trace.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:39.170
Police have no solid leads.
