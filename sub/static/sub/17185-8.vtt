lead mankind in a war against Skynet...

00:09.592 --> 00:13.470
...the computer system programmed
to destroy the world.

00:14.389 --> 00:17.433
It has sent machines back through time.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.101
Some to kill him.

00:19.269 --> 00:20.936
One to protect him.

00:21.104 --> 00:24.648
Today we fight to stop Skynet
from ever being created...

00:24.816 --> 00:27.276
...to change our future...

Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles:

00:43.793 --> 00:46.211
CAMERON: Cromartie came through.
He knows we're here.

00:46.379 --> 00:47.921
It's just a head.

00:48.089 --> 00:50.799
CAMERON:
We're programmed to repair ourselves.

00:50.967 --> 00:52.468
To blend in.

00:54.220 --> 00:57.014
He will rebuild
and continue his mission to hunt and kill.

00:57.182 --> 00:59.600
I know what his mission is.

00:59.851 --> 01:00.976

We got a problem.

01:01.144 --> 01:03.896
-Andy Goode rebuilt his chess computer.
-The Turk.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.231
DEREK: Somebody killed him
and took the machine.

01:06.399 --> 01:08.817
I was paid money for it, $20,000.

01:08.985 --> 01:11.320
-Who bought The Turk?
-That's all I have.

01:11.488 --> 01:15.115
These things, they're here.
They're programmed with specific missions.

01:15.283 --> 01:18.202

was sent for those Resistance fighters.

01:18.369 --> 01:20.662
SARAH: Humans sent back
from the future by John.

01:25.460 --> 01:28.170
Everything needs to be destroyed,
every last bolt.

01:28.338 --> 01:32.257
Even a single unaccounted-for piece
could hasten the arrival of Judgment Day.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.094
-You get it done.
-I swear.

01:53.196 --> 01:57.741
I need the list of new students who've
enrolled in the school since the fall of 2007.

01:57.909 --> 02:00.702
Males, Caucasian, ages 15 to 18.

02:00.870 --> 02:06.166
You boys are in here at least twice a month
waving your Patriot Act around.

Let me guess. Drugs?

02:09.212 --> 02:14.466
Look me in the eye and tell me
you've never smoked a little marijuana.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.638
I've never smoked a little marijuana.

[SCOFFS]

02:24.727 --> 02:26.895
Okay. Let's see your paperwork.

02:29.190 --> 02:31.859

or a signed national-security letter.

02:32.026 --> 02:34.653
-I don't have my paperwork.
-Sorry.

02:34.821 --> 02:38.907
The district will not release
personal information on students...

All of us wear masks.

03:09.606 --> 03:14.776
They can be worn out of love and the desire
to remain close to those around us...

03:14.944 --> 03:18.739
...to spare them from the complicated
reality of our frayed psyches.

We trade honesty for companionship.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.749
Mom, come on, it's gonna get burned.

Mr. Sarkissian, I'm calling again about
the computer, the one called "The Turk."

03:39.427 --> 03:44.806
Can you please call me back,
818-555-0189.

03:45.391 --> 03:47.142
JOHN:
Mom.

03:50.521 --> 03:54.983
The roast should have been removed from
the stove 18 minutes and 27 seconds ago.

03:55.485 --> 03:56.777
It's fine.

04:00.990 --> 04:02.449

All right...

04:02.617 --> 04:04.243
...not exactly fine.

04:11.834 --> 04:12.960
Where did you get this?

04:18.091 --> 04:20.842
-Her room.
-Why were you in my room?

04:21.010 --> 04:23.637
You told me you destroyed everything.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.223
She lied.

04:26.849 --> 04:29.810
The chip contains visual records
of the T-Triple-8.

04:29.978 --> 04:33.814
Where it's been, who it's interacted with.
It carries important information.

04:33.982 --> 04:38.026
It's a brain, the only truly irreplaceable
part of the machine and she kept it.

04:40.822 --> 04:43.657
Next, she's gonna tell us
that's gonna help us find The Turk.

04:43.825 --> 04:46.451
-It won't help us find The Turk.
-What are you saying?

04:46.619 --> 04:49.204
What I'm saying is what I've been saying.
"She can't be trusted."

04:49.372 --> 04:53.000
No matter how she acts on the outside,
we have no idea what's going on in there.

04:53.167 --> 04:55.544
Well, I could say that about you.

04:58.047 --> 05:01.383
Who showed you to my safe house?
She did.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.261
Who else knew about it? Nobody.

05:04.429 --> 05:06.221
Where are my men?

05:08.141 --> 05:09.391
In the morgue.

05:10.893 --> 05:13.312
I didn't give the Triple-8
the safe-house location.

05:13.479 --> 05:15.147
Prove it.

05:17.191 --> 05:19.026
Have you ever hacked one of those?

05:19.193 --> 05:21.403
-Have you ever read what's on it?
-No.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.905
But you have.

05:32.582 --> 05:33.915
So how often do you lie?

05:36.002 --> 05:37.919
When the mission requires it.

05:38.588 --> 05:40.088
Do you lie to me?

05:40.798 --> 05:42.049
Sometimes.

05:44.260 --> 05:45.761
About important things?

05:45.928 --> 05:47.596
Yes.

making a 7-Eleven run or something?

06:45.488 --> 06:50.659

It would mean a lot to me.

06:56.749 --> 06:58.083
[LAUGHS]

07:00.378 --> 07:02.337
How much power are you giving the chip?

07:02.505 --> 07:04.172
Uh....

07:06.092 --> 07:10.137
-We're running at 2.5 volts.
-My CPU requires a minimum of 6.2...

07:10.304 --> 07:14.182
...and a maximum of 8.7 continuous voltage
in order to function properly.

07:14.350 --> 07:17.185
That much use would burn out
any processor I've ever seen.

07:17.353 --> 07:21.022
Access to visual memory will require
less power than higher-level functions.

07:21.524 --> 07:22.941

07:23.109 --> 07:27.446

We don't wanna activate those functions.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.033

Once she's in the city's mainframe,
what's to say she'll come back out?

36:51.626 --> 36:54.169
You know, maybe it's not The Turk
that created Skynet.

36:54.337 --> 36:57.714
Maybe it's her.
Maybe this was her plan all along.

36:58.299 --> 37:02.219
She's a machine.
She doesn't have a soul and she never will.

You can trust me.

your guy was watching Barbara.

He'll meet about selling The Turk.
