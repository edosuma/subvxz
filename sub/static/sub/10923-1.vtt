00:14.068 --> 00:21.715
THE CIRCUS

01:42.657 --> 01:48.237
THE CIRCUS

02:24.448 --> 02:27.910
"So you missed the hoop again."

02:29.786 --> 02:31.830
"Father, I couldn't help it."

02:51.391 --> 02:55.020
"For that you don't eat tonight."

03:19.253 --> 03:22.422
"And you're supposed to be funny!"

03:25.592 --> 03:27.844
"Look at that house; empty!"

03:59.042 --> 04:03.255
Around the Side Shows
hungry and broke.

05:53.323 --> 05:55.409
"Here you are, sir."

06:00.998 --> 06:02.124
"Count it."

06:06.587 --> 06:08.213
"Is it all there?"

08:14.464 --> 08:16.633
"Say, gimme that money!"

10:00.821 --> 10:04.032
"How d'you get out of here?"

13:51.051 --> 13:52.052
"Rotten!"

13:55.138 --> 13:56.139
"Get off!"

14:02.980 --> 14:04.731
"Where's the funny man?"

14:09.069 --> 14:11.488
"Bring on the funny man!"

14:20.247 --> 14:21.832
The Funny Man.

14:27.921 --> 14:31.508
Meal-time after the Show.

14:57.951 --> 15:00.370
"Father won't let me."

15:45.249 --> 15:47.501
"Do you want a job?"

15:51.088 --> 15:55.676
"Be here in the morning,
and we'll try you out."

16:10.207 --> 16:14.920
Early the next morning.

17:10.518 --> 17:12.019
Hungry.

19:01.795 --> 19:03.339
"Run along home!"

19:05.716 --> 19:07.218
"I live here."

19:44.922 --> 19:46.715
"Excuse me, my cane."

20:03.274 --> 20:04.441
The Tryout.

20:07.528 --> 20:10.072
"Go ahead and be funny."

20:33.929 --> 20:35.306
"That's awful!"

20:46.442 --> 20:49.403
"Put on the William Tell act."

20:50.905 --> 20:55.826
"Now then, watch this
and see if you can do it."

21:49.547 --> 21:52.508
"Go ahead and try it."

23:22.640 --> 23:25.434
"Put on the barber-shop act."

25:37.191 --> 25:39.443
"Now I must hit you."

26:06.554 --> 26:07.888
"Now hit me!"

26:51.265 --> 26:52.433
"I can't see."

27:05.529 --> 27:07.156
"Just a moment!"

27:10.117 --> 27:12.495
"We haven't talked terms yet."

27:22.379 --> 27:24.924
"Get out and stay out!"

29:11.739 --> 29:12.948
"Show's starting!"

29:18.662 --> 29:20.748
"Aren't you coming in?"

29:27.671 --> 29:29.256
"You're not leaving?"

29:33.928 --> 29:37.139
"You see, we couldn't
come to terms."

29:49.610 --> 29:52.196
"Thank you for the egg."

30:14.552 --> 30:16.762
The Show on.

30:20.641 --> 30:23.727
Trouble with the
Property Men.

30:28.399 --> 30:31.193
"How about our back pay?"

30:35.573 --> 30:36.949
"Get to work!"

30:38.909 --> 30:39.994
"We quit!"

31:24.371 --> 31:25.623
"They've quit."

31:28.542 --> 31:29.877
"Get anybody!"

31:36.383 --> 31:38.219
"Do you want a job?"

32:33.774 --> 32:35.734
"Don't touch that button!"

33:57.024 --> 33:59.902
"He's a sensation,
but he doesn't know it."

34:00.110 --> 34:03.697
"Keep him on as a
property man."

34:15.458 --> 34:21.590
The Circus prospered,
but not the property man.

34:21.799 --> 34:25.928
And the girl led
the same hard life.

35:58.812 --> 36:04.401
"Keep him busy and don't let him
know he's the hit of the show."

36:41.438 --> 36:42.648
A Sick Horse.

37:03.752 --> 37:07.548
"Blow this pill down
the horse's neck!"

37:20.436 --> 37:22.479
"The horse blew first --"

39:02.830 --> 39:05.457
"Open the door, quick!"

41:05.953 --> 41:09.415
"I told you the lions
were dangerous!"

41:25.973 --> 41:26.974
"Where's that pill?"

41:31.562 --> 41:32.605
"Come here!"

41:34.231 --> 41:36.817
"I've got to see a doctor!"

42:03.010 --> 42:05.721
"It's a shame the way
they make you work --"

42:05.930 --> 42:09.016
"And you the hit of the show."

42:14.605 --> 42:16.398
"Why of course!"

42:16.649 --> 42:19.985
"All the crowds, all the
applause is just for you."

42:23.989 --> 42:24.949
"I knew it!"

42:57.982 --> 43:01.193
"If you strike
that girl, I'll quit!"

43:12.496 --> 43:15.624
"And what's more
I want what I'm worth --"

43:24.675 --> 43:27.178
"I'll give you
fifty dollars a week."

43:29.263 --> 43:30.055
"Sixty!"

43:33.184 --> 43:34.768
"I'll double it!"

43:36.187 --> 43:38.647
"Nothing less than a hundred."

43:48.115 --> 43:50.701
The Next Show.

43:54.663 --> 44:00.544
The success of the Tramp made life
easier for the girl and himself.

44:40.960 --> 44:44.630
"Oh, Merna, you must
have your fortune told!"

44:58.185 --> 45:05.568
"I see love and marriage with a dark,
handsome man who is near you now."

45:53.073 --> 45:57.703
A New Added Attraction,
Rex, a tight-rope walker.

46:04.502 --> 46:05.461
"Pardon me."

46:12.510 --> 46:13.844
"Go right ahead."

46:37.451 --> 46:39.912
"I'll give you
Five Dollars for it."

47:24.415 --> 47:26.876
"It's happened; I'm in love!"

47:33.591 --> 47:35.676
"He's a tight-rope walker."

47:35.926 --> 47:38.095
"I've just met him."

47:59.200 --> 48:01.118
"Hurry up, you're on!"

48:34.652 --> 48:38.823
The Act Over.

48:51.752 --> 48:53.170
"What's the matter?"

48:53.420 --> 48:54.880
"You hardly got a laugh!"

49:36.547 --> 49:38.465
"This is my friend."

50:08.996 --> 50:12.166
"I don't like
tight-rope walkers."

52:18.459 --> 52:22.171
Time brought many
changes to the Circus;

52:22.379 --> 52:26.133
New Hopes and
New Ambitions.

52:43.400 --> 52:45.402
His New Ambition.

53:25.442 --> 53:27.903
"Never mind the rope."

53:28.112 --> 53:31.323
"You'd better try and
be funny again or you'll go!"

53:39.540 --> 53:42.960
The next performance-
and not a smile.

54:05.065 --> 54:07.026
"I've had enough of this;"

54:07.234 --> 54:09.403
"You get one more chance."

54:18.913 --> 54:20.331
"Where's Rex?"

54:26.170 --> 54:29.965
"Rex, the tight-rope walker,
hasn't shown up."

54:37.348 --> 54:38.349
"Is Rex here?"

54:42.686 --> 54:45.189
"You can do the act, can't you?"

54:47.775 --> 54:49.610
"You'll do it or quit!"

54:56.784 --> 54:59.119
"I'll do it;
find his clothes!"

55:15.886 --> 55:17.805
"There's the clothes!"

55:41.745 --> 55:43.539
"You follow her!"

56:04.935 --> 56:06.437
"He'll kill himself."

56:09.106 --> 56:10.566
"That's all right;"

56:10.774 --> 56:12.568
"I've got him insured."

56:25.706 --> 56:28.584
"Take your time, there's
another act to go on."

56:50.147 --> 56:52.858
"Why, what is the
meaning of this?"

56:55.319 --> 56:58.823
"I am taking
his place on the rope."

57:01.575 --> 57:03.118
"You'll get killed."

57:04.745 --> 57:07.623
"Oh, no, I have a charmed life."

57:33.941 --> 57:37.278
"I'll give you five dollars
if you'll do it."

57:42.449 --> 57:45.286
"Not a word to anybody."

58:29.079 --> 58:31.749
"Please don't do this."

58:54.522 --> 58:56.690
"You've forgotten your tights."

59:02.196 --> 59:03.697
"You're on!"

01:05:01.639 --> 01:05:03.390
"You're through!!!"

01:05:15.402 --> 01:05:17.947
That Night.

01:05:41.929 --> 01:05:44.515
"I've run away
from the circus."

01:05:51.021 --> 01:05:53.023
"I'll never go back."

01:06:02.783 --> 01:06:05.995
"Can't you take me
with you?"

01:06:26.974 --> 01:06:28.726
"I've got an idea."

01:06:30.895 --> 01:06:32.313
"You stay here."

01:06:45.493 --> 01:06:47.411
"Have you seen Merna?"

01:07:05.262 --> 01:07:06.597
"She's run away --"

01:07:09.350 --> 01:07:12.102
"I can do nothing
for her -- --"

01:07:14.188 --> 01:07:16.607
"Now, there's one way out."

01:07:30.204 --> 01:07:31.914
"She's there now?"

01:07:44.385 --> 01:07:46.178
"Take me to her!"

01:07:58.732 --> 01:08:02.695
The Next Morning.

01:08:35.853 --> 01:08:39.231
The Circus ready to leave.

01:08:48.032 --> 01:08:49.992
"So you've come back -- You -- !"

01:08:56.790 --> 01:08:59.460
"You're speaking to my wife!"

01:09:37.413 --> 01:09:40.417
"Will you go on with the show?"

01:09:44.755 --> 01:09:46.340
"-- -- if you take him."

01:09:58.352 --> 01:10:00.729
"The end wagon for you."

01:10:09.864 --> 01:10:11.740
"Come in with us."
