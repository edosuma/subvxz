01:01.879 --> 01:03.573
Hello?

01:04.257 --> 01:07.291
Hello? Sir?

01:10.378 --> 01:12.048
Help!

01:12.263 --> 01:13.897
It's not clear what killed him,

01:13.906 --> 01:15.851
but he died five to ten hours ago.

01:15.860 --> 01:17.805
The canoeist found him
floating in the lake.

01:17.925 --> 01:20.148
Oh, and William, look at this.

01:21.877 --> 01:26.614
- "Let's get acquainted for fun and results."
- It's a flirtation card,

01:26.672 --> 01:29.065
to be slipped discreetly
to someone you wish to meet.

01:29.100 --> 01:32.565
So a woman gave him
this flirtation card,

01:32.603 --> 01:35.090
arranging a meeting. He then

01:35.145 --> 01:37.545
brought her here to this lovely spot.

01:37.580 --> 01:41.668
Romance ensued, judging by
the lip rouge on his face.

01:41.788 --> 01:43.660
Love was in the air.

01:43.957 --> 01:45.529
More than that.

01:45.763 --> 01:48.294
I believe I'm detecting
the smell of bitter almonds.

01:48.336 --> 01:49.961
It could be cyanide.

01:50.003 --> 01:53.071
Likely not the fun and
results he was expecting.

02:08.871 --> 02:12.329
How did you sleep?

02:12.449 --> 02:15.455
We might have been more
comfortable at my rooms.

02:15.973 --> 02:17.343
You always say that,

02:17.350 --> 02:19.591
but we never seem to make
it out of here before we...

02:21.375 --> 02:24.889
Well, then I must teach you
patience, George Crabtree.

02:25.353 --> 02:27.850
Let the lesson begin, Miss Bloom.

02:31.593 --> 02:33.100
Oh...

02:35.473 --> 02:38.199
Oh, uh... Good morning, ladies.

02:38.614 --> 02:40.690
What are you girls doing here so early?

02:40.710 --> 02:42.640
It's not early.

02:42.661 --> 02:45.690
I was just gonna help Josie
with her new routine, but, um...

02:46.299 --> 02:50.275
- we can just come back.
- Oh no, no! I'm gonna be late. Um...

02:50.944 --> 02:52.737
Where are my...

02:53.408 --> 02:56.672
Oh.

03:02.385 --> 03:03.838
It was a busy night.

03:03.859 --> 03:06.272
Young couples like the
privacy of the boats.

03:06.300 --> 03:08.603
This one came just after I was
shutting down for the night.

03:08.723 --> 03:11.411
- What time was that?
- Sometime after 10 o'clock.

03:11.432 --> 03:12.974
I told them it was too late, but

03:13.002 --> 03:14.601
the young man offered me an extra dollar

03:14.640 --> 03:16.550
to keep the boat out after hours and...

03:17.062 --> 03:18.749
he promised he was gonna tie it up.

03:18.966 --> 03:20.581
- Did you get his name?
- Uh,

03:20.656 --> 03:23.702
he signed the boat out
under Cameron Fellowes.

03:23.733 --> 03:24.893
His companion...

03:25.013 --> 03:26.323
can you describe her?

03:26.721 --> 03:28.532
Didn't much get a good look at her face.

03:28.695 --> 03:29.736
Blonde woman,

03:29.856 --> 03:31.067
wandered off to tease the ducks

03:31.067 --> 03:32.586
while the young man paid me.

03:32.922 --> 03:35.729
She cut a fine figure, though,
I can tell you that much.

03:36.592 --> 03:38.522
Wager the young man thought so too.

03:38.889 --> 03:41.501
- All right. Thank you.
- Hey.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.041
Excuse me.

03:52.581 --> 03:54.577
I'm looking for my husband.

03:54.600 --> 03:56.390
He never returned home last night.

03:56.415 --> 04:00.301
- Uh, what's your husband's name?
- Mr. Cameron Fellowes.

04:00.310 --> 04:02.195
Fellowes? Fellowes?

04:03.496 --> 04:06.011
I'm afraid there's no report
on anybody by that name.

04:06.028 --> 04:07.923
Oh, well, I brought his picture.

04:08.127 --> 04:10.186
Hello, Mrs. Fellowes?

04:10.380 --> 04:12.039
I'm Detective William Murdoch.

04:12.262 --> 04:14.085
May I have a moment of your time?

04:14.474 --> 04:15.722
What is it?

04:16.050 --> 04:17.793
My office is right this way.

04:23.123 --> 04:24.884
But I don't

04:24.888 --> 04:27.119
understand how he could die in a boat.

04:27.541 --> 04:30.285
At the moment, I'm treating
his death as suspicious.

04:31.839 --> 04:33.317
Was it the heart disease?

04:34.149 --> 04:35.207
The...

04:35.853 --> 04:38.106
No. No, I don't believe so.

04:38.118 --> 04:40.306
Perhaps it was one of those aneurysms.

04:40.521 --> 04:43.556
My sister told me they
can strike at any age.

04:43.590 --> 04:45.198
She's married to a doctor.

04:47.907 --> 04:49.421
Our coroner will determine

04:49.447 --> 04:51.731
the precise cause of
death, Mrs. Fellowes.

04:52.209 --> 04:55.714
What did your husband say he
was going to be doing last night?

04:55.794 --> 04:58.233
He said he would be home late.

04:58.278 --> 04:59.857
He was at a work function.

05:00.256 --> 05:01.588
What kind of work function?

05:02.102 --> 05:04.810
I don't know, but he was with Robert.

05:04.881 --> 05:05.948
Robert Roth.

05:06.342 --> 05:08.046
They work together, of course.

05:08.670 --> 05:10.388
In advertising sales.

05:12.270 --> 05:14.350
Witnesses suggest that...

05:14.876 --> 05:17.843
Mr. Fellowes was in the
company of a young lady

05:17.878 --> 05:19.104
prior to his death.

05:19.117 --> 05:20.866
Well, I'm sure his office can give you

05:20.866 --> 05:22.605
the names of the clients he met.

05:24.544 --> 05:28.466
It's been suggested that
this was not a work meeting,

05:28.735 --> 05:30.736
but a social one.

05:34.677 --> 05:36.519
This card was found

05:36.589 --> 05:38.395
in your husband's pocket.

05:39.002 --> 05:42.667
It's from a lady inviting him to meet...

05:44.102 --> 05:45.483
romantically.

05:51.548 --> 05:52.921
Of course!

05:53.514 --> 05:55.803
This must be one of Robert's gags.

05:55.923 --> 05:58.176
They're always playing
jokes on each other.

05:58.296 --> 06:00.880
As I mentioned, Mr. Fellowes was in fact

06:00.907 --> 06:03.213
in the company of a woman last night.

06:03.395 --> 06:06.724
My Cameron doesn't
meet with other women.

06:07.211 --> 06:09.438
Ask Robert what this is all about.

06:09.792 --> 06:12.293
He'll explain it to you so you can...

06:12.413 --> 06:13.953
understand.

06:17.455 --> 06:20.076
Mucking out the stables
would go a lot faster

06:20.107 --> 06:21.629
with three hands on deck, Henry.

06:21.868 --> 06:24.511
Well, then three of us would
smell like manure all day.

06:24.919 --> 06:26.849
Oh, don't worry, I'm
sure you could cover it up

06:26.897 --> 06:29.910
with some of that fancy eau
de cologne you like so much.

06:30.072 --> 06:32.799
You get started. I'll be out to
supervise you in a little while.

06:34.091 --> 06:35.162
Right.

06:39.139 --> 06:41.311
You look like a lady
who could use some help.

06:43.019 --> 06:44.033
George?

06:44.790 --> 06:48.136
Could you please ask a
Mr. Robert Roth to come in?

06:48.256 --> 06:50.916
You may find him at the
Crump Advertising Agency.

06:50.939 --> 06:52.425
- Sir.
- Oh, and George,

06:52.576 --> 06:54.240
might I suggest you stop by

06:54.249 --> 06:57.051
the Eaton's department
store on your way home?

06:57.215 --> 06:58.773
- Eaton's?
- Yes.

06:58.893 --> 07:01.942
You'll find they boast the best
that modern technology has to offer

07:01.961 --> 07:04.410
in their selection of alarm clocks.

07:06.158 --> 07:07.544
Yes, of course, sir.

07:10.487 --> 07:12.440
There was no dinner with clients.

07:12.462 --> 07:14.312
I didn't see Cameron last night.

07:14.608 --> 07:17.401
But if his wife had enquired,

07:17.445 --> 07:19.991
I would say he was with me.

07:21.217 --> 07:23.443
We're attempting to find the last person

07:23.461 --> 07:26.266
seen with Mr. Fellowes
prior to his death.

07:27.400 --> 07:30.932
Do you know anything
about this flirtation card?

07:32.184 --> 07:35.036
Yes. Cam showed me that.

07:35.053 --> 07:36.917
Progress for you right there.

07:37.037 --> 07:39.313
A woman slipped that
to Cameron in a pub.

07:39.623 --> 07:41.051
Lucky devil.

07:41.743 --> 07:43.198
Made it easy for him.

07:43.318 --> 07:44.560
Bless her.

07:44.809 --> 07:47.426
I hope more girls
will take up the habit.

07:47.702 --> 07:50.695
He said she was a beauty.

07:51.874 --> 07:53.612
She may have killed him.

07:54.502 --> 07:55.786
Well, that's...

07:56.527 --> 07:57.949
some way to go.

08:01.388 --> 08:03.998
The medical college is keeping
Miss James from you again today?

08:04.014 --> 08:06.244
Yes, and it's rather lonely without her.

08:06.521 --> 08:08.464
But I have been able to
confirm that Mr. Fellowes

08:08.469 --> 08:10.622
did indeed die from cyanide.

08:10.964 --> 08:13.803
- As you initially suspected.
- Yes,

08:13.820 --> 08:15.463
but he doesn't appear
to have ingested it

08:15.486 --> 08:18.169
and I found no other indication
of how it was administered.

08:18.505 --> 08:19.713
No needle marks?

08:19.752 --> 08:21.633
Except for a small cut on his lip,

08:21.705 --> 08:23.897
Mr. Fellowes is entirely unblemished.

08:25.656 --> 08:29.397
What does this lip rouge tell us
about the woman that he was with?

08:29.690 --> 08:31.467
It is a bold shade.

08:31.587 --> 08:33.667
Fashion is rather more subtle.

08:34.188 --> 08:35.655
A prostitute, perhaps?

08:35.660 --> 08:38.384
You'd be surprised how many
women now wear cosmetics.

08:39.236 --> 08:40.996
Do you have a little time?

08:43.767 --> 08:45.914
Where are we going exactly?

08:46.500 --> 08:48.963
Some shops in the city
don't wish to be found.

08:49.083 --> 08:50.811
Seems like a poor business scheme.

08:50.883 --> 08:53.074
Many customers enjoy the exclusivity.

08:54.020 --> 08:55.880
Now, William, I must confess

08:55.891 --> 08:58.878
that I sometimes like to use
a little lip rouge myself.

08:58.951 --> 09:01.015
Powder on occasion, things like that.

09:01.135 --> 09:03.505
- I'm sure you've never noticed.
- No.

09:05.390 --> 09:07.317
It's just for fun, really.

09:07.710 --> 09:09.979
The best products now are made in Paris

09:09.979 --> 09:11.760
and can be ordered specially, but...

09:12.926 --> 09:14.615
if I happen to run out,

09:14.637 --> 09:16.369
there's this gentleman.

09:18.953 --> 09:20.757
Detective Murdoch!

09:20.779 --> 09:22.744
It's a delight to meet you.

09:22.960 --> 09:25.068
Julia has described you so beautifully,

09:25.085 --> 09:26.806
I had a complete picture in my mind.

09:27.007 --> 09:29.583
And now you're here. In the flesh.

09:29.887 --> 09:31.232
Oscar Ducharme.

09:31.352 --> 09:33.938
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Ducharme.

09:34.314 --> 09:36.157
Are you here to see the new items?

09:36.179 --> 09:38.421
Actually, Oscar, we're
investigating a murder.

09:38.541 --> 09:40.147
And it led you to me.

09:40.387 --> 09:44.031
Yes, in fact, we're
trying to locate a woman

09:44.057 --> 09:47.239
who left behind traces of
lip rouge on our victim.

09:47.359 --> 09:50.326
- I wasn't familiar with the shade.
- Oh yes.

09:50.530 --> 09:52.766
It has too much orange
to suit you, Julia.

09:52.811 --> 09:55.455
But I told the Detective
you might recognize it.

09:55.488 --> 09:57.369
It looks like the coral pomade.

09:57.785 --> 10:00.109
In fact, I believe I have it in stock.

10:11.009 --> 10:13.140
Yes, it matches perfectly.

10:13.306 --> 10:16.892
May I have a list of your clientele
who have purchased this colour?

10:17.063 --> 10:18.347
No.

10:18.624 --> 10:20.942
It pains me to
disappoint you, Detective,

10:21.108 --> 10:23.195
but my customers require discretion.

10:23.670 --> 10:25.768
My job is only to

10:25.834 --> 10:28.363
improve on the charms of nature.

10:28.623 --> 10:31.550
Despite their beautifully
transformative potential,

10:32.469 --> 10:36.247
cosmetics are still perceived as wicked.

10:37.088 --> 10:38.638
Of course,

10:38.848 --> 10:41.100
that can be part of their appeal.

10:41.974 --> 10:45.499
I see. You don't keep
details on your clientele?

10:45.537 --> 10:48.536
Well, I do keep track of which
ladies prefer which shades.

10:50.461 --> 10:53.140
That would be most helpful.

10:54.572 --> 10:55.912
Do you like it?

10:56.129 --> 10:57.776
It's beautiful.

10:58.507 --> 11:00.814
That sounds like a hint, Detective.

11:01.151 --> 11:04.493
A woman like your wife
deserves the finer things.

11:04.676 --> 11:07.398
All right, I'll buy it.

11:08.173 --> 11:10.375
Now the list, please.

11:10.424 --> 11:12.162
Just this once.

11:13.180 --> 11:14.474
Ah!

11:19.039 --> 11:21.635
Mrs. Fellowes doesn't
appear to be a client.

11:22.951 --> 11:25.640
But Miss Nina Bloom is.

11:25.945 --> 11:27.931
George's sweetheart?

11:29.281 --> 11:30.896
Nevertheless, sir,

11:30.931 --> 11:33.198
many young women wear lip rouge.

11:33.318 --> 11:36.086
At this point we're simply
following the evidence, George.

11:36.206 --> 11:37.995
I just don't think it's
possible that Miss Bloom

11:38.006 --> 11:40.408
would be involved in
something as... dastardly.

11:40.452 --> 11:42.101
If you are uncomfortable,

11:42.101 --> 11:44.331
you may excuse yourself from this case.

11:44.785 --> 11:46.312
I think I'll stay, sir.

11:46.368 --> 11:48.382
It's quite rare to
see you make a mistake.

11:50.258 --> 11:52.067
Of course I buy rouge sticks.

11:52.095 --> 11:54.723
- We all do, don't we, girls?
- I love the stuff.

11:55.891 --> 11:58.131
Do you recognize this shade, Miss Bloom?

11:58.170 --> 11:59.956
Um... Yes.

12:00.001 --> 12:02.203
It looks like one I have.

12:03.652 --> 12:05.351
Is this a match, Detective?

12:08.715 --> 12:10.237
Why, yes, it is.

12:11.510 --> 12:12.721
Thank you.

12:13.413 --> 12:14.765
Ladies,

12:14.885 --> 12:17.026
do any of you recognize this chap?

12:17.644 --> 12:19.206
- No.
- Uh-uh.

12:19.379 --> 12:22.395
Right, then, uh... I
must ask, Miss Bloom:

12:22.409 --> 12:25.490
have you ever given a
man a flirtation card?

12:25.610 --> 12:28.644
George can tell you I'm
not that coy, Detective.

12:28.844 --> 12:30.154
Besides,

12:30.614 --> 12:32.428
when would I need to?

12:33.380 --> 12:34.924
Men give them to me.

12:34.967 --> 12:39.666
- But you don't return them?
- Heavens no! We don't return them.

12:39.786 --> 12:43.667
We collect them. We girls
keep a tally amongst us.

12:43.703 --> 12:45.985
Nina is well in the lead.

12:46.206 --> 12:47.855
Right. Um...

12:48.448 --> 12:50.342
Where were you last evening?

12:50.539 --> 12:53.316
I was on stage until after nine,

12:53.613 --> 12:55.581
and then later George came by.

12:56.691 --> 12:58.017
That's correct, sir,

12:58.051 --> 13:00.524
when I was finished with
Mr. Bloom at the auto garage.

13:00.524 --> 13:02.599
That would've been about two o'clock.

13:03.180 --> 13:05.090
And in the intervening hours?

13:05.125 --> 13:07.878
I was here, tidying up
after the girls and...

13:07.933 --> 13:09.637
waiting for George.

13:12.481 --> 13:15.917
- Thank you for your cooperation, Miss Bloom.
- My pleasure.

13:16.037 --> 13:17.915
Sir, perhaps the lads
and I should round up

13:17.915 --> 13:19.924
the rest of the lip rouge
customers on our list.

13:19.929 --> 13:22.812
Yes, thank you, George. We'll
interview them in the morning.

13:43.296 --> 13:44.408
I washed up

13:44.690 --> 13:46.417
Yeah, for hours last night

13:46.439 --> 13:48.303
and I still have the barn smell on me.

13:49.847 --> 13:52.465
Uh... Mrs. Conway.

13:56.504 --> 13:57.771
Hello, ladies.

13:58.015 --> 14:00.222
Doing some work today, are you, Henry?

14:00.421 --> 14:03.503
Always working, Jackson. Always working.

14:05.141 --> 14:08.052
You two did a barely
passable job on the stables.

14:08.976 --> 14:11.051
But I'll let it slide this time,

14:11.171 --> 14:13.269
seeing as how the Inspector's not here.

14:16.628 --> 14:19.028
I'd like to take him down a peg.

14:20.179 --> 14:21.784
Perhaps it's time we purchase

14:21.790 --> 14:24.136
one of those flirtation cards, McNabb.

14:27.899 --> 14:29.880
- Sir.
- Is that all of them?

14:29.930 --> 14:31.490
That's all that were on the list, sir.

14:31.507 --> 14:33.582
Did any of them provide
any new information?

14:33.643 --> 14:35.701
None of them admit to
knowing Mr. Fellowes,

14:35.707 --> 14:37.716
and most of them offer an alibi.

14:38.685 --> 14:41.635
- Sir. You're needed.
- Thank you.

14:42.669 --> 14:44.506
- With me, George.
- Sir.

14:45.352 --> 14:48.810
He checked in last evening, sir,
in the company of a blonde lady.

14:48.844 --> 14:50.321
He was only discovered this afternoon

14:50.343 --> 14:52.313
when the maid let herself in to clean.

14:55.776 --> 14:57.575
George, I know this man.

14:58.482 --> 14:59.932
This is Robert Roth,

14:59.970 --> 15:02.023
Mr. Fellowes' friend and colleague.

15:09.499 --> 15:11.917
Marked with the same lip rouge.

15:15.055 --> 15:19.011
Mr. Fellowes and his
best friend are now dead.

15:19.050 --> 15:20.942
Mr. Roth died in the
early hours of the morning,

15:20.969 --> 15:22.857
close to two AM, I'd hazard,

15:22.891 --> 15:26.015
- and cyanide is again indicated.
- Sir, Doctor,

15:26.026 --> 15:27.802
I spoke to the Fellowes' housemaid.

15:27.841 --> 15:30.226
Mr. Fellowes retired last
night at nine o'clock.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.887
Mr. Roth and his companion
checked into the hotel

15:32.887 --> 15:34.990
- sometime after ten.
- And the housemaid

15:35.001 --> 15:36.699
couldn't be sure that Mr.
Fellowes didn't leave again later,

15:36.722 --> 15:38.728
as she herself went to
bed shortly after nine.

15:38.730 --> 15:41.541
You think the first victim's
wife killed Mr. Roth as well?

15:41.661 --> 15:44.384
Well, she is blonde
and has a fine figure.

15:45.696 --> 15:47.964
Matching the general description

15:47.986 --> 15:50.598
of the woman who accompanied
Mr. Roth last night

15:50.764 --> 15:52.146
and the one that was seen with

15:52.174 --> 15:54.072
Mr. Fellowes down by the pond.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.783
And what motive would
she have to kill both men?

15:56.903 --> 15:58.581
Well, there is this.

15:58.609 --> 16:01.414
I convinced the housemaid to let me
have a look around the Fellowes' home.

16:01.580 --> 16:03.385
It's a pharmacist's preparation,

16:03.578 --> 16:06.328
topical, but poisonous if ingested.

16:06.887 --> 16:08.542
It contains cyanide.

16:08.662 --> 16:09.825
Well, then...

16:10.412 --> 16:12.138
bring in the grieving widow, George.

16:12.165 --> 16:13.106
Sir.

16:14.434 --> 16:16.459
Both of the victims
were well known to you.

16:16.503 --> 16:19.695
Yes, but they must know
other people as well.

16:20.752 --> 16:22.561
We found this in your home.

16:22.754 --> 16:25.438
It contains the same
poison that killed both

16:25.487 --> 16:27.259
your husband and Mr. Roth.

16:27.314 --> 16:30.506
You're wrong there,
Detective. That's never poison.

16:30.626 --> 16:33.394
It's a treatment for my varicose veins.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.956
I don't understand any of this.

16:37.616 --> 16:39.099
Mrs. Fellowes' medicine

16:39.132 --> 16:41.583
was a standard preparation
for varicose veins.

16:41.703 --> 16:43.805
It only had a small
amount of cyanide in it.

16:43.985 --> 16:47.112
How much would be required
to kill a man Mr. Roth's size?

16:47.112 --> 16:49.485
Half the bottle. But if
he'd ingested that much,

16:49.501 --> 16:51.579
I would've found it in
his stomach contents.

16:51.613 --> 16:54.582
- So this was not the murder weapon.
- I'm afraid not.

16:54.702 --> 16:58.776
But there is something interesting
about Mr. Roth, William.

17:00.232 --> 17:02.295
He has a small cut on his lip.

17:03.009 --> 17:06.584
- Just like Mr. Fellowes?
- Seems to be part of the killer's pattern.

17:07.195 --> 17:09.630
Could that be how the
poison was administered?

17:09.665 --> 17:11.396
Cyanide would take
effect much more quickly

17:11.425 --> 17:13.061
if it entered through a cut.

17:13.306 --> 17:16.299
What if, while kissing them,
she bit their lips deliberately?

17:16.320 --> 17:19.077
- And then applied the poison to the cut?
- Yes.

17:19.414 --> 17:22.248
Or the poison is in the lip rouge.

17:22.674 --> 17:25.661
These men would've effectively
been killed with a kiss.

17:25.781 --> 17:28.627
- Is that possible?
- I don't know, but

17:29.297 --> 17:32.141
I'm going to start by
analysing this rouge.

17:32.387 --> 17:35.089
If there's cyanide in it,
we'll have our murder weapon.

17:36.541 --> 17:38.079
Detective?

17:39.185 --> 17:41.062
I've just come from Mr. Roth's home.

17:41.096 --> 17:43.888
- Anything of interest?
- Well, there's this.

17:47.219 --> 17:49.327
- Is this... ?
- Miss Bloom, yes, sir.

17:49.387 --> 17:52.160
They sell these at the Star Room.
Mr. Roth may well have been there.

17:52.691 --> 17:54.855
George, were you with her last evening

17:54.877 --> 17:57.600
when Mr. Roth and his companion
were checked into the hotel?

17:57.617 --> 17:59.382
Sir...

18:00.062 --> 18:02.673
- George?
- I was not with her, sir, but

18:02.718 --> 18:05.069
it is impossible that
she's involved in this.

18:05.645 --> 18:08.879
I understand, but I'll need
to speak with her nevertheless.

18:08.897 --> 18:10.003
Well, let me come with you.

18:10.521 --> 18:12.890
I believe I'll conduct
this interview alone.

18:14.177 --> 18:15.396
Sir...

18:24.985 --> 18:26.087
Who left this?

18:26.463 --> 18:27.486
What is it?

18:27.512 --> 18:29.350
- It's an invitation.
- Come here.

18:29.961 --> 18:33.919
"Seeking a qualified agent
to inspect my new sofa.

18:33.976 --> 18:37.141
It is lonely with one
but guaranteed for two."

18:37.734 --> 18:39.518
Guaranteed for two.

18:39.558 --> 18:41.633
Well, that leaves little
to the imagination.

18:41.647 --> 18:43.139
You sure you don't know who left it?

18:43.538 --> 18:46.552
Well, that woman you were
making eyes at earlier.

18:46.853 --> 18:48.270
She's way out of Henry's league.

18:48.279 --> 18:50.859
No, no, but I did see her near his desk.

18:51.722 --> 18:54.086
- The lip rouge girl?
- Sadie Talbot.

18:54.463 --> 18:58.053
You know, I believe she works at
McGillion's Ice Cream Parlour on Shuter.

18:58.239 --> 19:01.237
Well! Now you're making
yourself useful, Jackson!

19:01.671 --> 19:03.136
At your service.

19:07.222 --> 19:09.223
I give out a lot of cards,

19:09.285 --> 19:11.769
but yes, I recognize him.

19:12.402 --> 19:14.035
He came in a few times.

19:15.226 --> 19:16.811
He's been murdered, Miss Bloom,

19:17.594 --> 19:19.157
evidently by the same person

19:19.174 --> 19:21.569
who murdered another
man the night before.

19:22.402 --> 19:24.239
Well, I would say that between that

19:24.253 --> 19:26.276
and my taste in rouge sticks,

19:26.820 --> 19:28.821
I must look like a good suspect.

19:30.321 --> 19:33.088
I'll be needing to take
your lip rouges for testing.

19:33.623 --> 19:34.673
All of them?

19:35.359 --> 19:36.496
Yes.

19:41.127 --> 19:43.902
Can anyone account for your
whereabouts last evening?

19:44.141 --> 19:46.703
All the men who saw me on stage.

19:47.969 --> 19:49.767
And after the show,

19:50.134 --> 19:51.440
once you left the club?

19:51.502 --> 19:53.149
I just went home to bed.

19:55.667 --> 19:57.841
Did anyone... see you there?

19:59.938 --> 20:02.564
Believe it or not, I
slept alone, Detective.

20:04.272 --> 20:05.270
Right, then.

20:06.552 --> 20:08.049
Thank you, Miss Bloom.

20:23.531 --> 20:24.339
George?

20:25.179 --> 20:26.152
Sir,

20:26.577 --> 20:28.022
I've been thinking about it.

20:28.483 --> 20:30.812
I really can't imagine why Nina
would be mixed up in all of this.

20:31.139 --> 20:33.582
Well, if she isn't, she
has nothing to worry about.

20:33.610 --> 20:36.692
I'm quite sure, sir, that
she is incapable of murder!

20:37.379 --> 20:39.295
I have no doubt you
believe that, George,

20:39.304 --> 20:42.314
but we must follow the
evidence. She remains a suspect.

20:42.477 --> 20:44.934
- Then let me talk to her. She won't lie to me.
- No, George.

20:44.987 --> 20:46.603
- Sir...
- I said no.

20:47.306 --> 20:50.214
I'm afraid I must insist
you stay away from this case.

20:50.688 --> 20:51.932
You understand.

20:54.456 --> 20:55.610
Sir.

21:01.302 --> 21:04.131
There's a significant amount
of cyanide in the lip rouge.

21:04.179 --> 21:06.516
Oh, that is bold!

21:07.047 --> 21:10.390
How did the killer ensure that
she herself didn't get poisoned?

21:10.407 --> 21:13.364
Perhaps she applies a
barrier to protect her lips.

21:13.598 --> 21:16.401
Wax would do the trick, but
it's certainly dangerous.

21:16.463 --> 21:18.633
Cyanide is fast and deadly.

21:18.659 --> 21:20.390
She must be very determined.

21:20.607 --> 21:22.067
And very foolish.

21:23.766 --> 21:26.487
Julia, could you test these as well?

21:26.859 --> 21:28.589
They're Miss Bloom's.

21:28.755 --> 21:30.322
I'll do it tonight.

21:31.243 --> 21:33.160
You don't think she has
something to do with this.

21:33.443 --> 21:37.532
I hope not, for George's sake.

21:58.868 --> 22:00.860
I love you, Nina!

22:10.204 --> 22:12.175
She's so comfortable out there.

22:12.427 --> 22:13.977
She's a real talent.

22:14.202 --> 22:17.703
- I've always admired her stage presence.
- Mm-hmm.

22:17.721 --> 22:20.470
Yes, her stage presence is lovely.

22:28.521 --> 22:30.890
I hope to one day dance as well as Nina.

22:30.925 --> 22:32.010
You, Josie?

22:32.607 --> 22:33.909
You're a fine dancer.

22:33.975 --> 22:35.901
Very... charming.

22:38.985 --> 22:41.456
- Your turn, Josie.
- Yes.

22:42.922 --> 22:45.693
Here to keep an eye on your
prime suspect, Constable?

22:46.007 --> 22:47.653
Well, it might help if
you told the Detective

22:47.680 --> 22:49.561
where you were when
the murders occurred.

22:49.561 --> 22:51.535
I already told him I was alone.

22:51.791 --> 22:53.451
I suppose he just didn't believe me.

22:55.213 --> 22:56.748
Do you believe me?

22:57.603 --> 22:58.913
Yes, of course.

23:00.905 --> 23:02.322
The murders, Nina...

23:03.101 --> 23:05.576
they have me thinking about
these flirtation cards.

23:05.589 --> 23:06.877
Who in their right mind

23:06.922 --> 23:08.888
would proposition a complete stranger,

23:09.140 --> 23:11.175
let alone agree to go and meet somebody

23:11.184 --> 23:12.273
that you don't know?

23:12.295 --> 23:15.593
It's a recipe for
misadventure, if you ask me.

23:15.602 --> 23:17.580
You're forgetting the
potential for delight.

23:17.863 --> 23:20.634
- Catching the eye of a stranger...
- It's not safe!

23:20.669 --> 23:22.103
- You should take those cards...
- George!

23:22.112 --> 23:23.776
You should take those cards

23:23.816 --> 23:26.038
and throw them in the garbage
to avoid the temptation.

23:26.051 --> 23:28.219
- Avoid the temptation?!
- Yes, get rid of them.

23:28.219 --> 23:31.216
- Don't you trust me, George?
- Nina, I'm telling you...

23:33.372 --> 23:34.834
I'm asking you...

23:36.175 --> 23:37.724
to throw them away.

23:38.402 --> 23:39.453
Well, I won't.

23:40.575 --> 23:43.364
Now, if you'll just wait a
moment, you can escort me home.

23:43.718 --> 23:44.833
Well, I won't.

23:45.550 --> 23:46.799
Not tonight.

23:50.171 --> 23:52.074
Then I'm happy I kept those cards.

24:14.009 --> 24:15.669
Cut on his lip as well.

24:16.262 --> 24:19.825
This method of murder is proving
to be surprisingly effective.

24:21.662 --> 24:25.183
"Eager purveyor of kisses
and hugs for gentlemen

24:25.303 --> 24:29.285
seeks the pleasure of your
company. Satisfaction assured."

24:29.405 --> 24:31.438
Addressed specifically to a Mr. Nielsen.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.801
Evidently he took the bait.

24:33.921 --> 24:35.970
This card has a printer's mark, sir.

24:39.456 --> 24:41.934
Sales in flirtation cards
have been very brisk.

24:41.984 --> 24:43.234
I don't keep track of every man

24:43.262 --> 24:45.038
who comes in and picks
a card off the rack.

24:46.023 --> 24:47.488
Have a closer look.

24:47.813 --> 24:49.947
These were ordered by a woman.

24:52.183 --> 24:54.242
Surely there can't
be very many women who

24:54.521 --> 24:57.273
- buy such cards.
- No, you're right, of course.

24:57.291 --> 25:01.177
Yes, these are custom
made for a special order.

25:01.712 --> 25:02.695
Here.

25:02.872 --> 25:04.276
A Miss Smith.

25:05.907 --> 25:07.317
Can you tell us what she looked like?

25:07.348 --> 25:10.444
I don't know. The transaction
was completed entirely by mail.

25:10.667 --> 25:12.800
Here is the address.

25:13.614 --> 25:15.163
Post office box.

25:15.434 --> 25:18.103
Sir, it looks like she
ordered ten cards in total.

25:20.033 --> 25:21.490
Leaving her with seven.

25:26.049 --> 25:29.024
Witnesses describe our Miss
Smith at the post office

25:29.042 --> 25:30.773
as being a blonde,

25:30.795 --> 25:33.221
well dressed, but none
of them saw her face.

25:33.292 --> 25:35.779
She wore a hat with a bit of
veil when she opened the box.

25:36.616 --> 25:38.830
She was careful and precise.

25:38.950 --> 25:40.808
These lip rouges are the same.

25:40.826 --> 25:42.641
Likely the same poison as well.

25:42.973 --> 25:44.084
The question is,

25:44.204 --> 25:47.293
what does this latest victim have
in common with the previous two?

25:47.311 --> 25:49.010
I'll search for a link, sir, but

25:49.130 --> 25:52.391
Mr. Nielsen is older
than the previous victims,

25:52.422 --> 25:54.011
he lives in a different part of town,

25:54.020 --> 25:58.485
he worked in trade, not
advertising... I found

25:58.804 --> 26:00.884
this receipt in his pocket.
Apparently he had dinner

26:00.886 --> 26:03.154
at the Heron and Swan.

26:03.510 --> 26:05.728
- Julia.
- William.

26:05.848 --> 26:08.340
I have completed the test you requested.

26:08.690 --> 26:09.566
Ah...

26:09.686 --> 26:12.598
George, why don't you go
down to the Heron and Swan

26:12.631 --> 26:15.466
and see if Mr. Roth ever visited there?

26:15.643 --> 26:16.962
Try the hotel first.

26:17.006 --> 26:19.493
Perhaps he discarded one of
these receipts there as well.

26:21.007 --> 26:22.516
Yes, of course.

26:27.080 --> 26:29.679
Did you find any poison
in Miss Bloom's lip rouge?

26:29.692 --> 26:32.100
- There were traces of cyanide.
- Is that so?

26:32.162 --> 26:34.902
But it's not uncommon for
cosmetics to be contaminated,

26:34.937 --> 26:38.408
and no single stick
contained enough to be lethal.

26:40.032 --> 26:41.272
All right.

26:41.683 --> 26:42.985
Thank you, Julia.

26:48.518 --> 26:49.957
If only we had a camera

26:49.979 --> 26:51.634
to capture the moment she slaps him.

26:51.696 --> 26:53.007
If she takes him down a peg,

26:53.042 --> 26:54.533
that'll be good enough for me.

27:01.664 --> 27:03.948
She looks really busy.
I'm gonna come back later.

27:03.996 --> 27:06.826
Surely a few kids after ice
cream won't keep you from romance.

27:06.857 --> 27:09.290
No, we really should
get back to work, boys.

27:09.410 --> 27:11.752
Henry, have you lost your nerve?

27:11.872 --> 27:13.651
Me? Never!

27:13.704 --> 27:15.140
Okay, well, go on then.

27:15.260 --> 27:17.480
Show her some of that
Henry Higgins charm

27:17.515 --> 27:19.118
we hear so much about.

27:19.118 --> 27:20.259
You can't fail.

27:21.096 --> 27:22.145
Well...

27:22.729 --> 27:23.924
I always do fail.

27:24.168 --> 27:25.314
The truth of it is...

27:29.351 --> 27:30.339
Wait...

27:36.240 --> 27:39.347
How long have you been Mr.
Nielsen's secretary, Miss Petrie?

27:39.378 --> 27:41.321
Two years in November, I believe.

27:43.817 --> 27:46.300
Do the names Cameron Fellowes

27:46.344 --> 27:49.611
- or Robert Roth sound familiar to you?
- No.

27:51.341 --> 27:53.899
Did Mr. Nielsen have
occasion to do business

27:53.912 --> 27:56.457
with the Crump advertising agency?

27:56.502 --> 27:59.791
No, we've been with Andrew
Signage and Advertising for years.

28:02.374 --> 28:05.664
You must have been upset to learn
the news of Mr. Nielsen's passing.

28:05.726 --> 28:08.612
Inasmuch as it relates to
my job at the company, yes.

28:08.635 --> 28:10.246
I would like to stay on here.

28:10.601 --> 28:12.646
But you weren't upset personally.

28:12.690 --> 28:14.345
Not considerably, no.

28:14.558 --> 28:17.488
To be truthful, Mr.
Nielsen was unpleasant.

28:17.864 --> 28:18.989
In what way?

28:19.033 --> 28:22.145
He was the sort of man who was
entertained by insulting people.

28:22.437 --> 28:24.505
But he paid well and I could handle him,

28:24.673 --> 28:26.879
at least better than
poor Doris Strachan.

28:27.405 --> 28:30.446
- Who is Doris Strachan?
- The girl I replaced.

28:31.831 --> 28:33.832
The woman I'm looking for

28:33.867 --> 28:37.010
has been described as
blonde and attractive.

28:37.045 --> 28:39.245
Does that sound like Doris Strachan?

28:39.365 --> 28:42.193
No, they tell me she
was not much to look at.

28:42.313 --> 28:44.730
I understand Mr. Nielsen
made merciless comments,

28:44.738 --> 28:46.898
causing her to cry daily, poor thing.

28:47.106 --> 28:49.722
I'd have told her he
wasn't worth the tears.

29:03.130 --> 29:04.869
Sir,

29:04.903 --> 29:06.445
I found this at the hotel.

29:06.693 --> 29:08.025
It's a swan.

29:08.888 --> 29:10.627
That's not unusual, George.

29:10.862 --> 29:12.583
Lizzie is in the habit of doing the same

29:12.588 --> 29:14.164
with our linens at the hotel.

29:14.199 --> 29:16.186
Unnecessary labour, if you ask me.

29:16.306 --> 29:17.541
And then

29:17.722 --> 29:19.271
there's the receipt

29:19.691 --> 29:22.272
for dinner for two at the Heron and Swan

29:22.303 --> 29:23.888
the night Mr. Nielsen was killed.

29:24.056 --> 29:25.604
That's a popular restaurant.

29:25.607 --> 29:28.993
And, sir, you told me that Mr. Fellowes

29:29.041 --> 29:31.299
was found in one of those paddle boats

29:31.335 --> 29:32.919
shaped like a swan!

29:33.419 --> 29:34.495
George,

29:34.967 --> 29:37.589
I understand your
feelings for Miss Bloom,

29:37.709 --> 29:39.590
but I really don't think you need to

29:39.590 --> 29:42.414
- manufacture theories in order...
- Sir, I'm trying to...

29:42.790 --> 29:44.823
I'm merely trying to point
out, with all due respect,

29:44.840 --> 29:46.700
you might be thinking
about this the wrong way.

29:51.264 --> 29:52.538
Detective Murdoch.

29:57.208 --> 29:59.103
Morris Snider is his name, sir.

29:59.112 --> 30:00.993
He's a teacher here at the school.

30:01.393 --> 30:04.796
Flirtation card, rouge, cut on his lip.

30:05.163 --> 30:07.752
So, the headmistress says she saw
him in his classroom this morning.

30:07.770 --> 30:09.085
He was in top spirits.

30:09.168 --> 30:11.975
She's killed in broad
daylight this time, George.

30:12.095 --> 30:14.471
This is the fourth victim in three days.

30:14.673 --> 30:16.343
Children discovered the body.

30:16.463 --> 30:19.173
I can't imagine that's very
good for their development.

30:19.239 --> 30:21.236
Right. Right. Constable,

30:21.462 --> 30:22.918
cover him up, please.

30:24.021 --> 30:25.836
You said he was a teacher here, George?

30:25.907 --> 30:27.439
Yes, sir, for the past thirty years.

30:27.559 --> 30:29.334
Competent, well-liked.

30:29.454 --> 30:31.090
He was due to retire
at the end of the term.

30:31.856 --> 30:33.472
Let's find his address.

30:42.731 --> 30:45.838
Sir, I was going through
Mr. Snider's effects...

30:46.139 --> 30:48.715
I found this photograph
of him with his students.

30:50.588 --> 30:52.389
Is that Mr. Roth as a boy?

30:53.155 --> 30:56.041
- And Mr. Fellowes, maybe?
- That's right.

30:56.723 --> 30:59.245
- And does that look like...
- It is.

30:59.585 --> 31:01.339
- Mrs. Fellowes.
- Sir,

31:01.384 --> 31:03.801
draw your attention to the banner
they're standing underneath.

31:04.722 --> 31:06.285
Swans.

31:07.161 --> 31:08.379
Swans.

31:16.306 --> 31:18.214
There's dear Cameron.

31:18.334 --> 31:20.622
He was the most handsome
boy in the class.

31:21.154 --> 31:24.664
You, your husband and Mr. Roth
all attended the same school.

31:24.996 --> 31:26.186
Of course we did.

31:26.730 --> 31:28.634
And Mr. Snider was a teacher there,

31:29.298 --> 31:31.163
and the three of them are all now dead.

31:31.171 --> 31:33.030
Oh, look! There's Beatrice.

31:33.233 --> 31:34.924
All that curly hair.

31:37.510 --> 31:41.255
Did there happen to be a Mr.
Nielsen in your circle of friends?

31:41.618 --> 31:43.202
I don't remember him.

31:43.676 --> 31:47.017
Goodness, I'd forgotten about this girl.

31:47.487 --> 31:49.771
See right there? Look at her...

31:50.483 --> 31:52.033
so unfortunate.

31:52.321 --> 31:53.618
What was her name?

31:53.799 --> 31:55.773
She had a crush on my
Cameron, but no hope.

31:55.777 --> 31:58.039
She moved on to Robert,
with even less success.

31:58.792 --> 32:00.860
Right. Well, thank you.

32:01.881 --> 32:03.396
What was her name?

32:04.005 --> 32:06.839
Boys were so cruel to her. Donkey face?

32:07.171 --> 32:08.883
Donkey Doris, that was it!

32:09.485 --> 32:11.061
- Doris Strachan?
- Yes!

32:11.088 --> 32:13.478
Donkey Doris Strachan!
Did you know her too?

32:17.126 --> 32:19.778
Miss Strachan knew all of the victims.

32:20.159 --> 32:22.226
Two were classmates,
one was her teacher,

32:22.249 --> 32:24.498
and Mr. Nielsen was her employer.

32:24.618 --> 32:26.325
And all were cruel to her.

32:27.184 --> 32:28.654
- Sir!
- George?

32:28.707 --> 32:31.792
After resigning Mr. Nielsen's
employ two years ago,

32:31.810 --> 32:33.771
Doris Strachan moved to New York City

32:33.820 --> 32:36.170
and never came back. The police there

32:36.391 --> 32:38.113
believe she committed suicide,

32:38.233 --> 32:40.074
but there was no body ever found.

32:40.831 --> 32:44.315
The problem is she doesn't match
any of the witnesses' description.

32:45.214 --> 32:46.254
If she is alive,

32:46.267 --> 32:49.051
perhaps she's working
with an accomplice. Or...

32:50.030 --> 32:51.477
she's a swan.

32:51.919 --> 32:53.110
A swan?

32:53.296 --> 32:54.664
George has a theory.

32:54.691 --> 32:56.887
There have been swans
at every crime scene.

32:56.927 --> 32:58.688
- Oh.
- Which puts me in mind of the old

32:58.710 --> 33:00.520
fairy story about the ugly duckling.

33:00.883 --> 33:03.708
You know, all the
other animals teased and

33:03.716 --> 33:06.338
ridiculed this strange-looking creature,

33:06.361 --> 33:08.989
until all she wanted to do was
wander off into the weeds and die,

33:09.007 --> 33:10.154
but one day...

33:12.080 --> 33:12.961
Go on.

33:13.081 --> 33:15.582
I'm sorry, sir, you don't
usually let me get this far.

33:15.616 --> 33:19.632
One day, the ugly duckling
transformed into a beautiful swan.

33:19.849 --> 33:21.601
Now, maybe Doris Strachan herself

33:21.627 --> 33:23.593
has transformed from an ugly duckling

33:23.776 --> 33:25.187
into a swan.

33:25.864 --> 33:28.826
And her motive is to get
revenge on her tormentors.

33:29.423 --> 33:31.194
It does fit with the
nature of the killings.

33:31.212 --> 33:33.058
All of the children in
this photograph appear

33:33.071 --> 33:35.500
to be fourteen or fifteen years old.

33:35.956 --> 33:38.387
Now, the witnesses
describe the killer as

33:38.507 --> 33:40.153
a beautiful young woman.

33:40.716 --> 33:42.291
Doris Strachan is...

33:42.366 --> 33:44.252
not beautiful, and I very much doubt

33:44.252 --> 33:46.107
nature could've been that kind to her.

33:47.100 --> 33:49.608
Perhaps nature had
nothing to do with it.

33:51.662 --> 33:53.915
Now, for Doris Strachan

33:53.937 --> 33:55.074
to have killed these men,

33:55.087 --> 33:57.331
she would've had to have
looked significantly different.

33:57.451 --> 33:59.235
What do you think, Mr. Ducharme?

33:59.271 --> 34:01.272
Could this woman

34:01.661 --> 34:03.352
be made beautiful?

34:05.756 --> 34:08.737
It is a challenge I would
dearly love to undertake.

34:08.938 --> 34:10.385
Where would you begin?

34:10.859 --> 34:12.027
Tapeworms.

34:12.824 --> 34:13.780
Tapeworms?

34:13.806 --> 34:15.687
The most reliable way to lose weight.

34:15.980 --> 34:18.858
I recommend them to all my
ladies who need a little aid.

34:18.885 --> 34:21.724
Oh, Oscar, you must
stop! It's not healthy!

34:21.762 --> 34:23.157
But so effective!

34:23.224 --> 34:25.668
She could lose
twenty-five to fifty pounds

34:25.789 --> 34:27.246
without even trying.

34:27.643 --> 34:31.190
Oh, imagine the effect it would
have on her cheekbones, Julia.

34:32.507 --> 34:36.326
Yes, look at that
eyebrow arch. Beautiful.

34:37.217 --> 34:40.293
Now, perhaps her eyes might appear

34:40.359 --> 34:41.935
more striking.

34:42.344 --> 34:44.498
I could do a slightly fuller lip.

34:46.976 --> 34:49.605
And are we ready for the hair?

34:49.996 --> 34:52.005
Would you like to do the honours?

35:10.487 --> 35:12.354
What's troubling you, Henry?

35:13.938 --> 35:16.434
I think I've lost my
self-confidence, George.

35:16.623 --> 35:17.970
What?

35:18.682 --> 35:20.169
Have a look at this.

35:24.046 --> 35:26.381
Somebody gave this to you?

35:26.442 --> 35:27.991
The most fetching woman.

35:28.111 --> 35:30.002
She works at McGillian's
ice cream stand.

35:30.037 --> 35:32.744
McGillian's ice cream?
She gave this to you?

35:33.247 --> 35:35.074
Don't sound so surprised, George.

35:35.108 --> 35:37.856
Henry, it seems to me
if she gave it to you,

35:37.976 --> 35:40.717
the door is wide open.
Walk on through, mate.

35:41.082 --> 35:42.891
You know, you're right, George.

35:43.865 --> 35:46.997
She's a forward, modern woman.

35:48.303 --> 35:50.367
I have to meet her on her level.

35:52.144 --> 35:53.859
Thank you, George.

35:56.504 --> 35:58.331
See how much larger her eyes look?

35:58.365 --> 35:59.891
Isn't that delightful?

36:01.003 --> 36:04.317
More of a rosebud shape
with the lips, perhaps.

36:06.440 --> 36:08.246
Ahh, wonderful.

36:09.408 --> 36:10.803
Except...

36:12.069 --> 36:13.663
her nose.

36:14.161 --> 36:16.043
It is rather prominent.

36:16.757 --> 36:19.628
Of course, there is a man who can
do remarkable things with noses.

36:19.700 --> 36:21.154
You know, surgically.

36:21.226 --> 36:24.618
Yes, but that kind of surgery is
still in its experimental stages.

36:24.651 --> 36:26.792
Surely it would leave terrible scars.

36:26.827 --> 36:29.974
- That could be obscured with a good face powder.
- Really?

36:31.081 --> 36:32.898
Genevieve Dawson.

36:33.560 --> 36:35.562
- No!
- Oh, she told me so herself.

36:36.647 --> 36:38.627
Just look closely the
next time you see her.

36:39.092 --> 36:40.906
She went to New York
City to have it done.

36:40.941 --> 36:44.033
- New York?
- Yes, to Dr. Victor Fry.

36:44.044 --> 36:45.632
Oh, he's a sensation.

36:45.752 --> 36:47.779
Our suspect went to New York.

36:48.255 --> 36:51.083
Then I imagine she might
have visited Dr. Fry.

36:51.110 --> 36:53.473
Oscar, this may be very important!

36:53.593 --> 36:55.243
I have to tell William!

36:59.299 --> 37:01.562
Let's see what we can do here.

37:20.097 --> 37:21.420
Nina!

37:38.916 --> 37:41.185
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's rude

37:41.218 --> 37:43.917
- to go through a woman's drawers?
- Josie!

37:44.914 --> 37:47.901
- These are yours, aren't they?
- I must admit,

37:47.973 --> 37:50.910
I was sorely tempted to
give you one of those.

37:50.944 --> 37:54.209
I was curious to see how
sweet on Nina you really were.

37:56.455 --> 37:58.164
Well, I'm flattered, but

37:58.364 --> 38:01.387
I have a feeling you and I
have very differing hobbies.

38:01.650 --> 38:03.514
You like my dancing.

38:04.710 --> 38:06.192
And don't you think I'm pretty?

38:06.215 --> 38:07.425
Of course.

38:07.685 --> 38:09.816
All those men you gave these cards to,

38:10.242 --> 38:11.807
they thought you were
pretty too, didn't they?

38:11.830 --> 38:13.982
Do you think Nina is prettier?

38:15.619 --> 38:18.701
I am sorry she met you first, George.

38:19.293 --> 38:22.839
I feel as though we
could really get along.

38:24.411 --> 38:26.212
Tell me I'm pretty.

38:26.691 --> 38:29.162
Or perhaps you could show me, George.

38:29.651 --> 38:32.053
You needn't be afraid
of this rouge stick.

38:32.173 --> 38:35.661
I chose the colour especially for you.

38:35.781 --> 38:36.928
Josie!

38:37.105 --> 38:39.661
- What do you think you're doing?
- Your gentleman friend

38:39.684 --> 38:41.587
isn't as loyal as you think, Nina.

38:41.707 --> 38:43.224
That's not true.

38:43.999 --> 38:45.403
Oh!

38:45.852 --> 38:48.607
- Oh, my God!
- My nose!

38:48.994 --> 38:50.549
My nose!

38:50.720 --> 38:52.380
My nose!

38:52.405 --> 38:55.706
Doris Strachan, you're under arrest

38:55.826 --> 38:58.893
- for murder.
- Murder? Josie?

38:59.419 --> 39:01.461
Thank you for your
assistance, Miss Bloom.

39:02.009 --> 39:04.437
You're most welcome, Constable Crabtree.

39:11.861 --> 39:15.530
It seems you've gone to great
lengths to change your appearance.

39:15.585 --> 39:18.761
I doubt very much you could
ever know how that feels,

39:19.298 --> 39:22.164
living life every day as a humiliation.

39:22.209 --> 39:24.228
You put yourself in harm's way,

39:24.543 --> 39:26.572
applying cyanide to your lips.

39:28.145 --> 39:29.909
It was worth the risk.

39:31.431 --> 39:33.169
Four men are dead.

39:33.490 --> 39:35.686
Their last moments were happy.

39:36.699 --> 39:39.288
Death by cyanide is very painful.

39:39.319 --> 39:40.926
But they were with me,

39:41.557 --> 39:43.289
beautiful me,

39:43.323 --> 39:45.972
and I was kind to them, Detective.

39:46.359 --> 39:48.561
I never even told them who I was.

39:48.871 --> 39:51.477
I think a couple of them
figured it out, but by

39:51.597 --> 39:53.695
that point it was too late.

39:54.664 --> 39:56.743
They got what they deserved.

39:57.595 --> 40:00.606
- For being unkind to you.
- Oh, yes.

40:01.396 --> 40:03.233
They gave me the right.

40:03.743 --> 40:05.596
What they did to me,

40:05.944 --> 40:08.163
how they made me feel...

40:08.855 --> 40:10.232
useless,

40:10.426 --> 40:12.036
worthless,

40:12.833 --> 40:14.305
ugly.

40:15.771 --> 40:17.652
That's no reason to kill.

40:17.907 --> 40:21.627
You beautiful people
will never understand.

40:24.252 --> 40:26.692
I was finally desired.

40:27.328 --> 40:29.674
And it was the most...

40:30.399 --> 40:32.911
wondrous thing ever.

40:40.054 --> 40:41.509
Where's Henry?

40:41.758 --> 40:43.252
Well, he's mustered up his courage

40:43.274 --> 40:45.150
and gone to talk to a young lady.

40:45.170 --> 40:47.882
The woman from
McGillian's ice cream stand

40:47.888 --> 40:50.377
- gave him a flirtation card.
- Oh, no.

40:51.185 --> 40:52.303
What is it?

40:52.330 --> 40:55.312
She didn't give him the card. I did.

40:55.673 --> 40:57.886
Jackson, he'll be crushed!

41:08.268 --> 41:10.010
Oh, Henry! Henry!

41:10.563 --> 41:12.743
- Poor Higgins.
- Poor girl.

41:13.585 --> 41:15.543
Excuse me, what are you doing?

41:18.874 --> 41:20.755
That's a beautiful dress you're wearing.

41:21.171 --> 41:23.473
Would make a lovely
decoration for my floor.

41:30.300 --> 41:33.460
I suppose we will have to
find which room best suits it.

41:35.202 --> 41:36.597
Come back for eight, why don't you.

41:36.763 --> 41:38.102
All right, then.

41:38.222 --> 41:39.990
Oh, of course.

41:40.024 --> 41:42.478
Thank you.

41:43.546 --> 41:46.163
I can't say that was
the outcome I expected.

41:46.434 --> 41:48.144
Nor I, Jackson.

41:48.780 --> 41:49.992
Nor I.

41:59.744 --> 42:01.213
Nina.

42:07.719 --> 42:09.656
You wanted to see me?

42:10.176 --> 42:11.670
Yes, George.

42:13.352 --> 42:15.140
Why are we up here?

42:15.643 --> 42:18.377
This is a place I come when
I want to think about things.

42:19.129 --> 42:20.856
I see.

42:26.195 --> 42:28.220
I would like you to have this.

42:33.061 --> 42:34.871
I don't want them anymore.

42:36.266 --> 42:37.826
Do with them what you may.

43:01.413 --> 43:04.046
Why did you do that, George?

43:04.533 --> 43:06.143
Everybody should be able to

43:06.263 --> 43:08.894
entertain the possibility
that they're admired.
