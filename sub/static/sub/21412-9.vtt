WEBVTT

00:01.186 --> 00:02.314
I have to say,

00:02.372 --> 00:05.056
even though swinging through the air
as Spidey is awesome,

00:05.130 --> 00:07.962
sometimes it's nice
to just walk to school.

00:09.469 --> 00:11.150
Uh-oh.

00:11.607 --> 00:14.665
Hey! I said I don't like you
walking on my side of the street.

00:14.741 --> 00:16.650
Hey, leave my son alone!

00:16.853 --> 00:18.376
Dad!

00:18.499 --> 00:20.398
Little baby needs his daddy.

00:20.465 --> 00:22.290
So long, baby!

00:22.728 --> 00:24.720
Told you I can
take care of myself, Dad.

00:24.825 --> 00:26.726
Miles, I know you can.

00:27.006 --> 00:29.908
But you have a gift.
You're smart.

00:30.057 --> 00:32.110
And that's what's going
to help you in life,

00:32.322 --> 00:33.814
not your fists.

00:33.952 --> 00:35.189
He's right, you know.

00:35.314 --> 00:38.015
Pete? You saw that too?

00:38.275 --> 00:39.798
Aw, man!

00:41.369 --> 00:43.415
It's nothing
to be ashamed of, Miles.

00:43.491 --> 00:45.705
I used to get bullied at Midtown
High all the time.

00:45.762 --> 00:46.805
What'd you do?

00:46.863 --> 00:49.650
Well, I found my own way
of feeling strong.

00:49.829 --> 00:51.438
Decided that doing the right things

00:51.496 --> 00:52.931
and making the right choices

00:52.988 --> 00:54.395
was the way to stand tall.

00:54.790 --> 00:56.165
That's real power.

00:56.249 --> 00:58.306
That's not power!

00:58.392 --> 01:00.626
Power is punching
those guys in the face.

01:00.684 --> 01:03.540
You watch. I just haven't
had my growth spurt yet,

01:03.598 --> 01:06.478
but, man, when I do,
people are gonna say...

01:06.586 --> 01:10.040
Oh, no! I was thinking more
like, "Oh, yeah, baby!"

01:10.165 --> 01:14.361
I mean, oh, no, there's some sort of
Slayer headed for Osborn Academy!

01:14.552 --> 01:17.244
- And that's where Harry is!
- I'm coming too.

01:17.595 --> 01:19.330
No. You're too s...

01:19.656 --> 01:21.756
You... need to call the police.

01:21.901 --> 01:23.267
Oh, I'll call the police,

01:23.325 --> 01:26.189
But there's no way I'm missing
something this exciting.

01:30.911 --> 01:33.394
<i>Osborn, I've come for you.</i>

01:33.534 --> 01:35.604
Spencer Smythe.

01:35.872 --> 01:38.292
It's about time
you returned my Slayer.

01:38.386 --> 01:40.253
<i>I had every right to keep it.</i>

01:40.371 --> 01:42.620
<i>You didn't deliver
your end of the bargain.</i>

01:42.747 --> 01:45.272
<i>Didn't give me a faculty
position at Oz Academy</i>

01:45.363 --> 01:48.698
<i>after I framed your son for sabotage,
just as you asked.</i>

01:50.120 --> 01:51.214
Leave us.

01:51.314 --> 01:53.237
Can't do that, sir.
Under orders.

01:53.361 --> 01:56.214
That order came from me,
you dolt!

01:57.050 --> 01:59.516
These things take time, Spencer.

01:59.831 --> 02:01.362
You need to be patient.

02:01.761 --> 02:05.112
<i>In exactly one minute,
this Slayer will explode,</i>

02:05.186 --> 02:07.644
<i>taking you and Osborn Academy...</i>

02:09.323 --> 02:11.181
Am I late for Slayer class?

02:11.292 --> 02:13.292
Spider-Man, you fool!

02:13.350 --> 02:16.183
That thing's a bomb,
and it's about to go off in

02:16.557 --> 02:18.096
two minutes.

02:18.357 --> 02:21.785
Two minutes? I can make my
own Slayer in two minutes,

02:22.058 --> 02:23.511
let alone diffuse one.

02:23.600 --> 02:26.144
Just need to get this hunk-a-junk
away from these people,

02:27.511 --> 02:28.542
take it to the roof

02:28.600 --> 02:30.612
for prime propulsion
conditions, and...

02:33.004 --> 02:34.996
Wait a minute. Spider-Sense?

02:35.058 --> 02:37.175
That wasn't two minutes! Aah!

02:42.697 --> 02:44.039

Spider-Man!

Oh, no! Is that Spider-Man?

- Relax, Miles.
- He'll pull out of it.

03:23.685 --> 03:26.990
He's gonna pull out of it.
He's gotta pull out of it!

03:27.068 --> 03:29.826

Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick.

03:46.240 --> 03:47.911
My head!

03:48.318 --> 03:49.717
What in...

03:49.928 --> 03:52.649
There's no way I fell
all that way and survived.

03:52.748 --> 03:54.232
But how? Hmm?

03:58.107 --> 03:59.537
I got it.

04:00.251 --> 04:03.394
And you were right.
The bum was the perfect distraction.

04:03.595 --> 04:05.270
And no one saw you?

04:05.678 --> 04:08.771
Just some kid, but he's not
someone we have to worry about.

04:08.922 --> 04:12.215
Do not underestimate
anyone, Smythe.

04:12.462 --> 04:14.873
Especially now that
you're working with

04:15.092 --> 04:16.857
Raymond Warren.

04:17.345 --> 04:20.545
Relax, Raymond. Our mutual
hatred of Norman Osborn

04:20.603 --> 04:22.732
is more than enough
to take him down.

04:22.843 --> 04:26.115
He'll soon learn he can't renege
on promises and get away with it.

04:26.178 --> 04:29.990
And now that you're out of prison,
there'll be no stopping us.

04:30.170 --> 04:33.217
Uh, how did you get out
of prison, exactly?

04:33.342 --> 04:35.455
There's a spider missing!

04:35.577 --> 04:38.217
I need the DNA
of all eight spiders,

04:38.275 --> 04:40.428
and the Electrolis Arachnatis
is missing!

04:40.554 --> 04:42.012
Where is it?

04:48.362 --> 04:51.858
Aah! What in the world bit me?

04:59.666 --> 05:01.520
I can't believe I took this job.

05:01.617 --> 05:05.045
- Harry!
- Pete? What are you doing here?

05:05.173 --> 05:07.381
I heard there was an attack
at Oz Academy.

05:07.558 --> 05:10.272
- You okay?
- Nah, I'm fine, thanks.

05:10.408 --> 05:12.795
I wasn't anywhere near the attack.
But guess what?

05:12.868 --> 05:14.811
Turns out,
it was another Slayer.

05:14.898 --> 05:17.865
You know, the kind that attacked
me at Midtown High that day.

05:17.976 --> 05:22.303
No kidding. And who,
uh... Who stopped it?

05:22.607 --> 05:24.959
Spider-Man was there,
if that's what you're asking.

05:25.052 --> 05:28.897
But more importantly, now we know
who was controlling the Slayer...

05:29.178 --> 05:31.240
Spencer Smythe.

05:31.701 --> 05:33.608
My dad said he was
targeting me again.

05:33.702 --> 05:36.108
Really? That's not the way
I saw it... heard it.

05:36.186 --> 05:38.842
That's not the way I heard it
when you told me just now.

05:38.942 --> 05:42.022
So, uh, no other
superheroes showed up,

05:42.135 --> 05:45.076
maybe to, uh, help Spider-Man?

05:45.289 --> 05:48.483
No. But I take offense to you
calling him a superhero.

05:48.608 --> 05:50.100
That guy's a menace.

05:50.379 --> 05:52.623
Well, I'm just happy
you're safe.

05:53.014 --> 05:54.233
Breakfast tomorrow?

05:54.471 --> 05:56.365
Phsh! As always.

05:57.564 --> 06:01.084
Okay, Smythe. It's not your style
to just blow something up.

06:01.166 --> 06:03.274
Especially a school
your son is attending.

06:03.380 --> 06:05.139
So what's your game plan?

06:05.425 --> 06:08.779
And why would Norman lie about
the Slayer coming after Harry?

06:09.733 --> 06:11.412
Hey, Miles. What's up?

06:11.647 --> 06:15.389
<i>Pete, I gotta see you, man.
Like now!</i>

06:15.694 --> 06:17.002
Okay.

06:18.983 --> 06:21.639
Miles, you okay?

06:22.009 --> 06:24.285
- Miles!
- Up here!

06:26.115 --> 06:28.298
What? Who?

06:28.459 --> 06:31.100
I'll tell you who. It's me,

06:32.240 --> 06:34.343
Friendly Neighborhood
Spider-Man!

06:35.205 --> 06:36.883
Uh...

06:39.156 --> 06:41.590
You're... Spider-Man?

06:41.745 --> 06:44.508
Okay, I'm not
the original Spider-Man,

06:44.610 --> 06:47.360
but I got bitten by...
something, and...

06:47.475 --> 06:49.200
And look at this!

06:51.220 --> 06:54.305
I can crawl along walls
like a spider.

06:54.626 --> 06:56.704
And I have super
strength like a spider.

06:56.762 --> 06:58.805
So I'm thinking
I was bitten by...

06:59.788 --> 07:02.446
Hear me out on this... a spider.

07:02.570 --> 07:05.989
- Also, I have this spider bite.
- Let me see it.

07:06.102 --> 07:09.610
This is the greatest day of my life!
There are two Spider-Men.

07:09.687 --> 07:12.712
I even whipped up this costume
so the world knows we're buddies.

07:12.770 --> 07:16.798
Spider-Man and Spider... Kid,
or something.

07:16.975 --> 07:18.571
Man, this is gonna be great!

07:18.698 --> 07:20.993
Okay. Slow down.

07:21.062 --> 07:23.149
We need to find out
exactly what happened to you.

07:23.383 --> 07:24.813
I'll tell you what happened.

07:24.988 --> 07:28.344
Instead of a growth spurt,
I got a power spurt.

07:28.469 --> 07:32.438
And now the world is going to
have to listen to Miles Morales.

07:32.496 --> 07:35.204
- I can't wait to show everyone!
- Miles, wait!

07:35.421 --> 07:40.251
I know you're excited,
but secret identities exist for a reason.

07:40.493 --> 07:42.368
Being a superhero is dangerous.

07:42.426 --> 07:44.251
You can't just go around sharing your

07:44.316 --> 07:46.079
private life with everyone
you know.

07:46.391 --> 07:48.501
Hmm. You're right.

07:49.063 --> 07:50.657
Check it out!

07:52.196 --> 07:53.805
I'm Spider-Man!

07:54.057 --> 07:56.298
- What?
- Unbelievable!

07:56.356 --> 08:00.133
- What? I'm not telling everyone.
- Just Anya and Gwen.

08:00.237 --> 08:03.158
- Is he for real?
- Yeah. Is this some sort of trick?

08:03.261 --> 08:05.666
Nope. I think he
really has powers.

08:05.760 --> 08:08.682
Not just any powers,
Spider-Man's powers!

08:08.740 --> 08:10.049
Except the webs, of course.

08:10.115 --> 08:11.612
They don't seem to have
grown in yet.

08:11.670 --> 08:13.158
See?

08:14.424 --> 08:16.783
Um, that was the chair.

08:17.658 --> 08:18.851
I knew that.

08:18.933 --> 08:20.866
Now sit down
so we can run a test.

08:20.924 --> 08:22.979
A test? I don't need a test.

08:23.059 --> 08:26.053
That's work. I want to play
and show off what I can do.

08:26.148 --> 08:29.846
Miles, you're the second person
in this city to get spider powers.

08:29.903 --> 08:33.033
That's not a coincidence.
It's what some one look into you.

08:33.154 --> 08:35.486
Yeah. Maybe there's something
going around. G int

08:35.596 --> 08:38.770
Oh! Maybe we can
all get spider powers.

08:38.844 --> 08:40.736
- Oh, yeah. That would be cool!
- That would be awesome.

08:40.802 --> 08:44.814
Guys! You talk about these
powers like they're a gift.

08:45.006 --> 08:47.674
But they come with
a lot of responsibility.

08:47.941 --> 08:50.182
I mean, they must, right?

08:50.393 --> 08:53.330
I bet, at times, even
Spider-Man finds them a burden.

08:53.612 --> 08:55.690
Well, if he does,
he's not doing it right.

08:55.989 --> 08:57.885
'Cause all I feel is awesome!

08:58.011 --> 09:00.940
Yeah. And who's to say
he is doing it right?

09:00.998 --> 09:03.783
Maybe having a secret identity
isn't the way to go.

09:04.049 --> 09:05.486
Look at the Avengers.

09:05.589 --> 09:08.158
Oh, yeah!
Maybe I can be an Avenger!

09:08.301 --> 09:10.042
You think they hold auditions?

09:10.361 --> 09:13.369
Ooh, maybe they patrol the streets
looking for new recruits.

09:13.487 --> 09:15.096
In which case, I gotta go.

09:15.209 --> 09:18.077
If Captain America calls,
put in a good word for me!

09:18.189 --> 09:19.713
He's not gonna...

09:22.090 --> 09:23.861
What is it, Adrian?

09:23.970 --> 09:27.557
Raymond Warren's confiscated
spider experiment is missing.

09:27.740 --> 09:30.135
It must have happened
during the Slayer attack.

09:30.305 --> 09:32.789
So the bomb was a distraction?

09:33.027 --> 09:34.776
That's pretty clever.

09:35.815 --> 09:38.088
Especially for Spencer Smythe.

09:38.536 --> 09:40.596
Which makes me think
he's not working alone.

09:40.749 --> 09:43.080
Smythe couldn't have known
about the spiders

09:43.138 --> 09:45.379
without some insider knowledge.

09:45.620 --> 09:47.877
But Raymond Warren is the only other person

09:47.940 --> 09:50.463
who knows about it,
and he's in prison.

09:50.760 --> 09:53.705
Then either Spencer is
working for Warren,

09:53.920 --> 09:55.975
or I've underestimated him.

09:56.166 --> 09:59.901
Either way, that experiment in the
wrong hands could be disastrous.

10:00.221 --> 10:01.588
Why do you say that?

10:01.646 --> 10:03.580
Raymond came to me
once with a plan

10:03.735 --> 10:05.588
for creating a spider army.

10:05.704 --> 10:09.182
Human soldiers who, when exposed
to these enhanced spiders,

10:09.280 --> 10:11.760
would gain the abilities
of arachnids.

10:12.099 --> 10:14.315
It was intriguing, I must admit.

10:14.736 --> 10:18.018
But I found Raymond's behavior
to be erratic,

10:18.088 --> 10:21.361
inconsistent,
so I confiscated them.

10:21.656 --> 10:24.221
Then why didn't
you destroy them?

10:24.416 --> 10:27.846
Because I couldn't be certain
they were his only spiders.

10:28.023 --> 10:30.901
And if he does succeed
in this monstrous plan,

10:31.377 --> 10:33.635
I'll need a live sample to
create an antidote.

10:33.752 --> 10:36.729
Do I detect
a hint of fear, Norman?

10:45.288 --> 10:48.776
Fear, Adrian, is for people
who are unprepared.

10:49.474 --> 10:52.516
I'm more concerned with
who has the upper hand.

10:53.057 --> 10:54.549
The Slayers.

10:54.987 --> 10:57.791
You created them to battle
the spider army

10:57.924 --> 11:00.401
in the event Raymond succeeded.

11:01.080 --> 11:03.174
Merely a precaution.

11:03.287 --> 11:06.479
Or, as of today, a prevention.

11:06.577 --> 11:09.065
We need to get those spiders
back from Spencer Smythe

11:09.123 --> 11:10.932
before he gets them to Warren.

11:10.990 --> 11:13.221
And how do you propose
we do that?

11:13.627 --> 11:14.642
Easy.

11:14.799 --> 11:18.135
We use a Smythe
to catch a Smythe.

11:18.772 --> 11:20.638
First day as a superhero!

11:20.674 --> 11:23.119
First day
of nonstop awesomeness!

11:23.209 --> 11:24.776
Someone help!

11:24.834 --> 11:27.218
No prob. I happen to
know just the guy.

11:30.033 --> 11:33.376
Here, kitty, kitty.
Here you go, little girl.

11:33.486 --> 11:36.881
That isn't my cat.
I'm a member of Tree Huggers.

11:36.939 --> 11:39.181
That cat was hurting that tree.

11:41.242 --> 11:42.986
Safety first, young lady!

11:43.665 --> 11:45.837
I was going that way.

11:45.998 --> 11:47.039
Oops. My bad.

11:48.275 --> 11:50.251
Sorry.

11:53.030 --> 11:54.297
Sorry, not sorry!

11:56.649 --> 12:00.042
Spider-Man. Spider-Man!
Why the change of costume?

12:00.745 --> 12:03.128
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm not Spider-Man.</i>

12:03.218 --> 12:06.128
<i>But I am available for photo shoots
and crime-fighting conventions.</i>

12:06.237 --> 12:07.682
Then who are you?

12:07.740 --> 12:09.873
<i>Just a hero trying to do
my neighborhood</i>

12:09.931 --> 12:11.880
<i>on 14th Street proud.</i>

12:13.818 --> 12:15.760
<i>You heard it here first, folks.</i>

12:15.885 --> 12:19.643
<i>A new hero is cleaning up
this two-spider town.</i>

12:19.963 --> 12:22.096
<i>A new hero? Hey, I like
the sound of that.</i>

12:22.155 --> 12:25.090
Looks like we found the recipient
of the missing spider DNA.

12:25.414 --> 12:28.753
There's a good chance
that Norman is seeing this too.

12:28.906 --> 12:31.965
Meaning he'll want this new
spider as much as we do.

12:32.237 --> 12:35.065
Take the new Slayer
and get to him first.

12:35.447 --> 12:37.760
Yeah, you tell your mama
I don't like bologna.

12:38.034 --> 12:41.674
If I'm gonna steal your lunch,
I at least wanna enjoy it.

12:42.776 --> 12:44.937
Hey, bad-hair
losers, leave him alone!

12:45.066 --> 12:48.928
Oh, yeah, Spidey! New costume?
Oh, yeah! Spider-Man!

12:48.986 --> 12:51.768
No, I'm the new Spider-Man,
and you're in my neighborhood.

12:51.877 --> 12:54.690
Now, still think it's fun
to push people around?

12:54.794 --> 12:57.667
W-We don't push people around.

12:57.730 --> 13:01.682
Oh, no? What about that Miles Morales
kid you picked on this morning?

13:01.948 --> 13:02.973
Who?

13:05.052 --> 13:07.331
You know.
The really good-looking one.

13:07.456 --> 13:10.096
Uh... Oh, oh, don't tell me you
don't think he's good-looking,

13:10.229 --> 13:11.870
'cause I will
pop you right here.

13:11.928 --> 13:13.299
In fact, I will...

13:13.439 --> 13:15.870
Yeah, you better run off.

13:16.649 --> 13:19.096
Spider-Man! What's up, buddy?

13:19.206 --> 13:21.737
You bringing me a superhero
welcome basket or something?

13:21.814 --> 13:24.229
You were a little tough on
those kids, don't you think?

13:24.388 --> 13:26.213
No way, man. They're bullies.

13:26.290 --> 13:27.643
They're always picking
on people.

13:27.795 --> 13:30.206
Just be careful not to become
a bully yourself.

13:30.401 --> 13:32.667
Revenge is not what
being a hero is about.

13:32.755 --> 13:33.807
No way, man.

13:33.914 --> 13:36.471
I wanna be like you.
You're my hero.

13:36.651 --> 13:39.799
Oh. Well, in that case,

13:39.857 --> 13:41.752
I'd like to share
something with you.

13:42.023 --> 13:43.776
Someone very smart
once told me

13:43.867 --> 13:46.151
that with
great power comes great...

13:46.229 --> 13:48.385
- People skills?
- No.

13:48.598 --> 13:50.497
Comes great...
Cell phone reception?

13:50.555 --> 13:52.135
- Can I finish?
- Sure.

13:52.193 --> 13:55.034
- Comes great responsibility.
- Response-a-what now?

13:55.401 --> 13:57.596
I wasn't bitten
by a police officer.

13:57.654 --> 13:59.854
I was bitten
by an awesome spider.

14:01.206 --> 14:03.604
So I taught some bullies a lesson.
So what?

14:03.870 --> 14:04.924
This is my neighborhood,

14:04.982 --> 14:07.534
and I want to make sure
everyone feels safe.

14:09.549 --> 14:10.608
That's another thing.

14:10.838 --> 14:12.838
There's a reason
for secret identities.

14:12.900 --> 14:15.971
You shouldn't be giving away
so much personal information.

14:16.838 --> 14:18.307
Do you realize you just told

14:18.365 --> 14:21.362
a live television audience
where you live?

14:23.025 --> 14:26.593
That means...
you saw my interview!

14:26.894 --> 14:28.612
How'd I look? Great, right?

14:28.670 --> 14:30.654
Did you hear
they're calling me a new hero?

14:30.712 --> 14:31.748
Yes.

14:31.806 --> 14:33.412
And now anyone
who wants to challenge

14:33.470 --> 14:35.474
you knows exactly
where to find you.

14:35.537 --> 14:38.349
Please!
No one's coming after me.

14:40.497 --> 14:44.193
New spider, I have come for you.

14:44.293 --> 14:47.568
Huh? Looks like that spider bite
gave me great comic timing.

14:47.759 --> 14:50.427
Get to safety while
I take this Slayer down.

14:52.543 --> 14:55.795
No way. This is what
you call a team-up, baby!

14:55.919 --> 14:57.295
You're not ready for this.

14:57.420 --> 14:58.795
Come on.
We'll smash him.

14:58.868 --> 15:00.787
There's two of us and only one of him.

15:01.006 --> 15:02.607
Hey,
new spider,

15:02.685 --> 15:04.270
I've come for you.

15:04.369 --> 15:05.786
Yeah, uh, no.

15:05.844 --> 15:08.395
What is this, the corner of
Slayer and Slayer?

15:08.574 --> 15:10.615
Wait. I can come up
with a better quip than that.

15:10.965 --> 15:13.996
Got any quips that can
stop two monstrous robots?

15:18.212 --> 15:20.090
Your first
super battle can be scary.

15:20.293 --> 15:22.278
But if we work together,
then we'll be able to...

15:22.336 --> 15:25.245
- Scary?
- No way! This is awesome!

15:25.418 --> 15:27.137
Time to impress
the neighborhood.

15:27.344 --> 15:31.169
No! Stay close to me!
You're not prepared for... Aah!

15:31.323 --> 15:34.731
Sorry, Slayers.
Spider season is over.

15:36.886 --> 15:39.575
Aah! What's happening
in my head?

15:41.278 --> 15:42.934
It's called your Spider-Sense.

15:42.992 --> 15:44.927
And it means you need to move!

15:51.874 --> 15:54.958
Step off! He's mine!

15:55.270 --> 15:57.098
Alistair, is that you?

15:57.200 --> 15:58.484
<i>What are you doing?</i>

15:58.669 --> 16:00.481
Following orders, Dad!

16:00.539 --> 16:04.380
This new Spider-Man is part of an
experiment that was stolen from Oscorp.

16:06.219 --> 16:07.352
Whoa!

16:07.410 --> 16:10.532
I've got my own sticky powers,
thank you very much.

16:11.829 --> 16:13.423
They're both targeting you,

16:13.524 --> 16:15.122
which means you need
to get out of here!

16:15.180 --> 16:17.255
Yikes! I'm not running
from anybody.

16:20.023 --> 16:21.681
Whoa!

16:25.586 --> 16:28.127
Norman stole that experiment.

16:28.877 --> 16:30.806
Just like you stole his Slayer?

16:30.884 --> 16:33.361
This Slayer may have
started as his,

16:34.799 --> 16:37.689
but it's been enhanced
by a true genius.

16:38.624 --> 16:40.767
So has this one.

16:47.114 --> 16:49.184
Take advantage of them arguing
and get out of here.

16:49.301 --> 16:52.574
I'll take care of it.
If you're staying, I'm staying.

16:52.642 --> 16:56.114
I see the experiment isn't the
only thing Osborn has stolen.

16:56.262 --> 16:59.590
He's delivering on all the
things you never could, Dad.

17:03.270 --> 17:05.442
<i>Target locked.</i>

17:05.925 --> 17:08.324
Then may the best Slayer win.

17:08.496 --> 17:10.457
You asked for it.

17:32.500 --> 17:33.973
That's my...

17:56.192 --> 17:58.106
Let him go!

18:02.675 --> 18:05.356
It appears there's no
getting to that new spider

18:05.489 --> 18:07.653
with you in the way, Spider-Man.

18:07.711 --> 18:11.137
Unfortunately, he's the only one
I need to bring in alive.

18:13.161 --> 18:14.778
Spider-Man was right.

18:14.939 --> 18:17.512
Never should've
told them where I live.

18:17.590 --> 18:19.918
Aah! Whoa!

18:23.512 --> 18:26.647
Leave him alone!

18:28.184 --> 18:29.184
Aah!

18:34.631 --> 18:37.036
What the... I can do that?

18:37.185 --> 18:39.325
Whoa! He can do that?

18:39.420 --> 18:41.943
Look out! It's up again!

18:44.200 --> 18:46.044
If that Slayer's so determined

18:46.102 --> 18:48.536
to suck something in,
let me give it what it wants.

18:48.617 --> 18:51.951
Hey! That Slayer above you is falling!
Get out of the way!

18:52.279 --> 18:55.732
I've got it! More of my
powers seem to be coming in.

18:55.891 --> 18:58.717
Maybe that means
I'll have webs like you.

19:01.734 --> 19:02.982
No! No!

19:07.224 --> 19:10.201
My webs aren't organic.
I made them myself.

19:10.389 --> 19:12.123
Now you tell me.

19:13.764 --> 19:15.562
Eject! Eject!

19:15.803 --> 19:18.357
<i>Launch sequence activated.</i>

19:19.688 --> 19:21.771
Not a bad idea, son.

19:26.223 --> 19:28.146
You're gonna be fine.

19:28.451 --> 19:31.029
Whoa! Where do you
think you're going?

19:32.709 --> 19:33.873
Huh?

19:33.958 --> 19:37.271
Outta my way, worms, or I'll wipe
the street with you.

19:38.176 --> 19:42.006
Hey! Nobody bullies
the people in my neighborhood!

19:42.064 --> 19:44.814
Or city, for that matter.
He's very territorial.

19:45.428 --> 19:47.853
- Yeah! In your face!
- Ugh!

19:50.681 --> 19:52.564
All of this was because of me.

19:52.748 --> 19:55.565
I told the bad guys
exactly where to find me,

19:55.900 --> 19:57.798
and put the people
I care about in danger.

19:57.890 --> 20:00.353
Hey, I've made
a lot of mistakes too.

20:00.587 --> 20:02.267
In fact, I'm still making them.

20:02.611 --> 20:06.680
I guess sometimes you need to walk
before you can wall-crawl, eh?

20:06.715 --> 20:09.459
Eh? Is that a joke?
'Cause I don't get it.

20:09.517 --> 20:11.884
Hey. Excuse me. Yes?

20:12.046 --> 20:15.048
I just wanted to thank you for
keeping our neighborhood safe.

20:15.158 --> 20:18.001
Oh, uh, anytime.

20:18.090 --> 20:20.814
- I wish my son Miles could meet you.
- Why's that?

20:20.892 --> 20:22.921
Well, I told him that power

20:22.957 --> 20:25.283
is using your brain
instead of your brawn,

20:25.344 --> 20:29.087
but I'm realizing now that the truth
is probably somewhere in the middle.

20:29.737 --> 20:31.687
You might be right.

20:33.626 --> 20:34.673
Raymond?

20:34.759 --> 20:36.418
How did you wind up
back in jail?

20:36.454 --> 20:38.189
What are you talking about?

20:38.423 --> 20:41.829
I never left.
And how do you know my name?

20:43.845 --> 20:45.853
I failed, Mr. Osborn.

20:46.236 --> 20:48.439
Did your father
capture the new spider?

20:48.556 --> 20:49.865
No, sir.

20:50.079 --> 20:52.033
Then the battle isn't over.

20:52.246 --> 20:56.431
In fact, I have a feeling
the war is just beginning.

20:58.298 --> 21:00.665
I can't believe
you have electro-blasts.

21:00.731 --> 21:02.931
Do you know how helpful
those would be to me?

21:03.103 --> 21:05.220
Yeah, but you've got webs.

21:05.456 --> 21:09.298
- Correction. <i>We've</i> got webs.
- Really?

21:09.533 --> 21:12.805
Oh, man! I can't wait
to shoot these things!

21:12.869 --> 21:14.447
After you've practiced more.

21:14.505 --> 21:17.923
- That's so lame...
- I-I-I-I mean, of course.

21:17.999 --> 21:21.892
Hey, how come you use just these
two middle fingers to shoot?

21:21.978 --> 21:25.492
Oh, that's easy. Because after
testing numerous scenarios

21:25.528 --> 21:27.415
and experimenting with the psi,

21:27.548 --> 21:29.087
I realized...

21:29.434 --> 21:31.602
this way is just more awesome!
