03:15.770 --> 03:16.956
Yeah.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.034
Morning, sir.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.370
It's a hard life if you can't read.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.372
Pardon?

03:29.877 --> 03:34.463
Sir, Mr. Wiley Starke has...
Well, he's passed away, sir.

03:35.090 --> 03:36.757
His funeral is tomorrow,

03:36.842 --> 03:38.718
and I thought that you might
want to know since...

03:38.802 --> 03:40.261
What got him?

03:42.598 --> 03:44.265
Just got old, sir.

03:46.393 --> 03:47.935
Yeah, well.

03:49.605 --> 03:50.605
Yeah.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.280
Well...

07:18.063 --> 07:21.357
I always thought you'd go first.

08:00.689 --> 08:01.689
Hey.

08:06.528 --> 08:08.821
Don't look so disappointed, huh?

08:53.366 --> 08:54.450
Buddy?

09:05.045 --> 09:07.129
What can I do for you, sir?

09:19.601 --> 09:20.851
That's all right. Come on in.

09:21.436 --> 09:22.811
Have a seat.

09:29.819 --> 09:32.154
What's on your mind, sir?

09:32.989 --> 09:35.199
About time for me to get low.

09:36.660 --> 09:38.994
- To get what?
- Down to business.

09:42.582 --> 09:43.958
I need a funeral.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.377
For whom?

09:46.461 --> 09:47.795
Me.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.923
For you? You want to buy a funeral for you?

09:51.007 --> 09:52.007
Am I not talking right?

09:52.425 --> 09:54.093
I'm sorry, sir. Are you sick?

09:54.177 --> 09:56.720
- Everybody dies.
- All right.

09:57.222 --> 09:58.472
I see.

09:59.557 --> 10:03.936
Well, sir, the church can help you
get your affairs in order,

10:04.020 --> 10:05.271
and arrange a service for you.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.356
Well, what would you say?

10:08.358 --> 10:09.566
About what?

10:09.859 --> 10:10.859
Me.

10:11.403 --> 10:13.195
A eulogy.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.491
I don't know. What do you want me to say?

10:17.575 --> 10:19.868
Say what you'd say right now to my face.

10:20.328 --> 10:23.205
Well, Mr. Bush,
I don't know much about you.

10:23.748 --> 10:24.873
I've heard stories, but...

10:24.958 --> 10:26.417
What stories?

10:26.501 --> 10:28.127
Just stories, you know.

10:28.211 --> 10:29.211
People talking.

10:29.296 --> 10:32.381
What kind of stories? I mean, say one.

10:32.882 --> 10:36.218
Well, sir, my mother used to say
that gossip is the devil's radio.

10:37.053 --> 10:41.390
What matters is that
when you come to the end of your life,

10:42.350 --> 10:44.393
that you're ready for the next one.

10:46.396 --> 10:49.023
Now, have you made peace with God, sir?

10:55.155 --> 10:56.405
I paid.

10:56.489 --> 10:59.283
Well, Mr. Bush, you can't buy forgiveness.

11:00.410 --> 11:03.245
It's free, but you do have to ask for it.

11:19.637 --> 11:22.890
I heard the most awful things about him
when I was a kid.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.059
Y'all come on in.

11:41.284 --> 11:44.953
Hey, hey. That's that old man Bush. It is.

11:55.465 --> 11:56.465
Hey.

12:03.848 --> 12:05.140
We know about you, old man.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.518
You stay out of this diner, you hear me?

12:08.603 --> 12:09.978
There's women and children in there,

12:10.271 --> 12:11.814
and we don't want you around them.

12:13.191 --> 12:14.191
Hey!

12:14.567 --> 12:17.027
Look at me when I'm talking to you, old man.
I know you hear me.

12:18.321 --> 12:19.613
You hear me?

12:19.697 --> 12:21.949
You come around here again,
there'll be trouble.

12:23.743 --> 12:24.952
Oh, shit. Whoa!

12:30.583 --> 12:31.625
Carl!

12:34.754 --> 12:35.921
Carl, honey!

12:38.133 --> 12:40.092
I know. It's all right.

12:55.024 --> 12:58.902
- Frank? There was a fight.
- Let me guess.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.115
- Carl?
- Well, yeah,

13:03.199 --> 13:05.200
but it was with that old man Bush.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.910
Old man?

13:07.036 --> 13:08.537
- Is there a body?
- No.

13:08.872 --> 13:11.123
He was the one that was doing the beating.

13:11.207 --> 13:13.125
I ain't never seen nothing like it
before in my life.

13:14.377 --> 13:17.463
Social event of the year, and I missed it.

13:18.381 --> 13:19.715
You read the paper today?

13:20.049 --> 13:22.259
People are dying in bunches.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.304
Everywhere but here.

13:28.308 --> 13:31.560
What are the odds of a funeral home
going broke

13:31.895 --> 13:35.397
when you have a business
that everybody on Earth needs?

13:37.025 --> 13:40.360
If you can't make that work,
it's got to be you, right?

13:40.445 --> 13:42.905
And, yet, I don't know.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.282
What do you do when people won't die?

13:46.159 --> 13:47.743
- Well, I guess...
- One thing about Chicago,

13:47.952 --> 13:49.036
people know how to die.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.623
They drown, get run over, shot.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.501
Whatever it takes.

13:55.585 --> 13:59.463
Well, we get it done around here.
It's just we're not in a hurry about it.

14:03.885 --> 14:05.511
It's them or us.

14:14.646 --> 14:16.813
I might know of someone
who's looking for a funeral.

14:21.236 --> 14:22.486
How much did he have?

14:22.779 --> 14:24.571
It was all wadded up.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.992
Hermit money. That's good.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.253
There it is.

14:41.965 --> 14:43.340
There's his sign.

14:57.146 --> 14:58.438
What are you doing?

15:00.316 --> 15:03.360
You've been wanting a shot at sales.

15:03.444 --> 15:06.321
As of right now, you're on commission.

15:07.991 --> 15:13.036
Remember, foot in the door, establish trust
and drop the hammer.

15:18.209 --> 15:19.501
I'd rather you go, too.

15:20.920 --> 15:24.006
No doubt.
But if you don't do this by yourself,

15:24.674 --> 15:26.925
you'll never know if you're any good.

15:27.010 --> 15:30.596
And you'll never be good
if you don't know that you are.

16:18.895 --> 16:20.103
Hello?

16:37.914 --> 16:39.498
Wanna see inside my house, do you?

16:39.707 --> 16:40.749
What does it look like?

16:47.799 --> 16:48.799
Katie.

16:51.719 --> 16:55.055
I see you at the church
with your wife and baby?

17:00.061 --> 17:01.311
Yes, sir.

17:01.396 --> 17:03.438
What the hell you doing here?

17:09.194 --> 17:10.194
I heard...

17:10.445 --> 17:13.448
I heard you were after a funeral, sir.

17:13.616 --> 17:14.950
- A funeral?
- Yes, sir.

17:15.992 --> 17:17.828
I work at Quinn Funeral Home, sir.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.414
I thought I could help you.

17:32.427 --> 17:34.052
You like rabbit?

17:37.515 --> 17:39.141
It's how you put things together, see.

17:40.101 --> 17:42.477
Now, some things go,

17:42.979 --> 17:44.855
and some things never will.

17:46.107 --> 17:47.607
And the Indians said
that everything spoke to them.

17:47.692 --> 17:50.485
That's how they made medicines,
and knew what to eat.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.320
I mean, things talked to them,

17:52.405 --> 17:55.073
clear as we talk. You believe that?

17:55.658 --> 17:57.659
- I don't know, sir.
- Yeah?

17:58.995 --> 18:02.164
Well, you don't listen,
you don't hear nothing.

18:05.918 --> 18:09.838
All right. Be ready here directly.
Got forks here. Here you go.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.173
Did you make this furniture, sir?

18:11.507 --> 18:13.341
I've never seen anything like it.

18:14.510 --> 18:17.012
- Can't tell what's holding it up.
- Yeah, well...

18:18.556 --> 18:19.556
Magic.

18:20.183 --> 18:24.227
- Yeah. Yeah.
- All right.

18:24.562 --> 18:28.857
Well, sir,
if you do want to plan for your funeral,

18:29.525 --> 18:32.611
which I hope will be a long,
long time away from now,

18:32.695 --> 18:35.989
but we'd treat you with respect,
and offer you

18:36.866 --> 18:38.909
a real good service for...

18:40.912 --> 18:44.080
What'd everybody say about
what happened in town?

18:44.373 --> 18:47.250
That crazy son of a bitch tried to kill a man
for no reason, is that it?

18:48.711 --> 18:50.086
There's two sides to every story.

18:50.171 --> 18:52.214
People say that,
but they don't believe it, no, sir.

18:52.548 --> 18:55.383
They think what they think,
and they don't wanna know anything else.

18:56.135 --> 19:00.388
I also think that people are so scared about
what they don't know that

19:00.473 --> 19:02.349
they make things up to feel better about it.

19:02.433 --> 19:05.435
Like life after dying, you know.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.145
Heaven.

19:08.439 --> 19:10.565
Well, I hope that part's true, don't you?

19:11.484 --> 19:13.944
I don't think we know the actual truth
about anything.

19:14.111 --> 19:17.739
I know I don't.
I'm just guessing most of the time.

19:19.742 --> 19:21.493
Lord, this is good.

19:26.916 --> 19:29.668
You boys been coming out here
to throw rocks at my window

19:29.752 --> 19:31.419
for what, 25, 30 years?

19:32.255 --> 19:34.589
- No, I...
- Know lots of stories about me?

19:38.094 --> 19:39.094
Well, yes, sir.

19:39.345 --> 19:40.512
Tell one.

19:40.596 --> 19:41.596
I'd rather not.

19:41.681 --> 19:44.391
I'd rather you did. All right?

19:49.105 --> 19:54.150
Well, when I was a kid, I heard
you killed some fellas in a fist fight.

20:00.992 --> 20:02.325
Is that all?

20:06.414 --> 20:07.455
What's your name again?

20:07.540 --> 20:09.291
Buddy Robinson, sir.

20:10.293 --> 20:12.127
Well, if I need you,

20:12.795 --> 20:14.504
I know who you are.

20:56.047 --> 21:00.508
Yes, ma'am. I do respect your wishes.
But, you see, state law requires...

21:02.178 --> 21:05.180
No, ma'am.
We can't bury him beneath the house.

21:07.683 --> 21:08.975
All right. Well, just for argument's sake,

21:09.060 --> 21:11.353
how would you get the casket
under the house?

21:13.814 --> 21:15.148
No casket.

21:19.278 --> 21:23.239
Well, but you have to have a container
of some kind, ma'am, for

21:23.950 --> 21:26.785
decency and for sanitation.

21:29.038 --> 21:31.122
Yes, ma'am,
but there's lots of things that are natural

21:31.374 --> 21:33.083
that aren't decent.

21:36.671 --> 21:37.671
Would you like to come in, sir?

21:38.381 --> 21:39.756
He did what?

21:40.466 --> 21:41.675
- Good God.
- Leave it.

21:41.759 --> 21:45.136
No, ma'am.
I didn't know that about your husband.

21:45.221 --> 21:48.306
Well, yeah, now I understand
why you want him under the house.

21:48.391 --> 21:50.016
But, still... Hello?

21:50.267 --> 21:52.519
Frank Quinn. This is Mr. Bush.

21:56.524 --> 21:57.649
Come on in. Pleasure.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.360
Coffee?

22:01.320 --> 22:02.320
It's a pleasure.

22:03.072 --> 22:04.572
She'll call back.

22:05.032 --> 22:06.199
Are you

22:08.411 --> 22:09.953
from anywhere?

22:10.871 --> 22:12.956
Little bit of everywhere, yeah.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.916
Get him a chair, Buddy.

22:16.085 --> 22:17.794
Here you go, sir.

22:28.139 --> 22:29.973
What can we do for you, sir?

22:30.266 --> 22:31.516
I'm after a funeral.

22:31.809 --> 22:34.936
Boy, are you in luck. Follow me, please.

23:24.695 --> 23:26.112
Solid pecan.

23:27.323 --> 23:28.823
Steel handles.

23:29.658 --> 23:31.701
Forget the box. What else?

23:32.661 --> 23:34.412
Whatever you want.

23:34.830 --> 23:36.081
- Flowers.
- No, no.

23:36.165 --> 23:37.207
Burial plot.

23:37.291 --> 23:38.875
- Got it.
- A service.

23:39.126 --> 23:41.086
- Party.
- A what?

23:41.170 --> 23:42.170
A party.

23:44.965 --> 23:46.424
What kind of party?

23:46.509 --> 23:47.842
A funeral party.

23:55.184 --> 23:56.684
We can do that.

23:58.354 --> 23:59.604
And I wannabe there.

24:00.022 --> 24:01.439
You will be, I guarantee it.

24:01.524 --> 24:03.775
I wannabe there now.

24:04.401 --> 24:08.863
You want to be at your funeral party alive?

24:09.657 --> 24:10.740
Yes, sir.

24:10.825 --> 24:16.162
But you can't have a funeral if you're not,
you know, deceased.

24:18.499 --> 24:22.669
Hold on, now. It's a detail. We can look at it.

24:22.753 --> 24:23.753
Pretty big detail.

24:23.838 --> 24:25.797
You want to have a funeral party

24:26.215 --> 24:29.384
while you're alive, so you can go.

24:30.719 --> 24:31.803
Yes or no?

24:32.054 --> 24:33.096
Yes!

24:34.348 --> 24:35.807
Buddy, get some paper.

24:35.891 --> 24:37.976
We need to make a list of
who Mr. Bush wants to invite.

24:38.227 --> 24:39.644
Well, sit down there.

24:39.728 --> 24:43.898
I want everybody to come
who's got a story to tell about me.

24:46.068 --> 24:47.277
All right, say again?

24:47.361 --> 24:48.528
Probably covers about four counties.

24:48.696 --> 24:50.238
Then I want four counties worth of people

24:51.031 --> 24:52.031
at the party.

24:56.704 --> 24:58.788
Well, sir, the thing is,

24:58.873 --> 25:01.457
how do you invite people...

25:03.252 --> 25:04.794
How do you get people to come

25:05.588 --> 25:07.338
tell stories about you,

25:07.923 --> 25:09.924
that I'm guessing might get them,

25:10.926 --> 25:12.510
you know, shot?

25:14.263 --> 25:16.264
- Now, sir.
- You know what? Don't worry about it.

25:16.682 --> 25:20.602
You go on ahead. Don't worry about it.
We'll come up with something.

25:20.686 --> 25:22.979
- Couple of ideas just came to me.
- Like what?

25:24.773 --> 25:29.527
Felix?

25:31.113 --> 25:33.865
Felix, say hello to me.

25:37.620 --> 25:38.661
Hey, Mattie.

25:39.622 --> 25:41.039
How does she know him?

25:41.790 --> 25:42.957
I heard you moved off.

25:43.626 --> 25:46.294
- I've been back awhile.
- Yeah, well...

25:49.882 --> 25:51.299
How are you?

25:53.636 --> 25:55.803
You look like you always did.

26:07.149 --> 26:09.609
Do you see the size of that thing?

26:10.319 --> 26:11.319
What?

26:11.695 --> 26:12.862
What do you mean, what?

26:13.614 --> 26:15.657
That goddamn ball of money.

26:21.080 --> 26:25.250
If he wants a party with pink balloons
on his ears, we're going to give it to him.

26:25.334 --> 26:26.918
But we can't throw him a party if he's...

26:27.002 --> 26:31.339
I sold 26 of the ugliest cars ever made
one December in Chicago,

26:31.423 --> 26:33.967
with the wind blowing so hard up my ass,

26:34.051 --> 26:37.553
I was farting snowflakes in July.
So, don't tell me we can't do this.

26:37.805 --> 26:40.890
- But we can't...
- That is going to be the last "but"

26:40.975 --> 26:44.894
I ever hear from you. You're a salesman now.
Sell.

26:55.197 --> 26:58.574
A thousand years ago, he was
the most interesting man I'd ever met.

26:59.368 --> 27:00.368
Get out of here.

27:01.203 --> 27:02.287
He was.

27:02.413 --> 27:04.122
Are you serious?

27:04.206 --> 27:06.624
And I don't just mean the way he looked.

27:06.709 --> 27:09.127
- Well, I hope not.
- Listen.

27:09.503 --> 27:10.878
He was beautiful.

27:13.382 --> 27:15.591
Most people are laid out nice and simple,
you know.

27:15.676 --> 27:17.552
You always know what they're thinking.

27:17.928 --> 27:22.390
And he was like this big old cave
that just went deeper and deeper and...

27:25.144 --> 27:26.561
There's still nobody like him.

27:34.528 --> 27:37.155
You hungry? Let me help you with that.

27:40.075 --> 27:41.075
Hey.

27:42.411 --> 27:46.414
It's okay. It's okay. Hey, are you hungry?

27:46.874 --> 27:49.292
I might have a little hissy fit
coming on soon, too.

27:50.419 --> 27:51.419
Is that right?

27:51.503 --> 27:53.212
Feeling a little weepy.

27:54.882 --> 27:56.049
You boys.

27:57.426 --> 27:59.761
I can maybe do something
really good for us, Katie.

28:01.013 --> 28:03.598
- You already have.
- Money-wise, I mean.

28:05.059 --> 28:06.768
About Mr. Bush?

28:07.311 --> 28:09.187
Yeah. I get half of what we make off of him.

28:10.356 --> 28:11.898
So why aren't you happy about it?

28:13.525 --> 28:14.817
I didn't know I wasn't.

28:19.656 --> 28:21.783
I guess I was for a minute.

28:23.118 --> 28:27.372
But the whole thing about making a carnival
out of someone's death,

28:27.748 --> 28:29.791
I just don't know if it's right.

28:30.667 --> 28:32.210
Well, is it what he wants?

28:32.294 --> 28:33.669
He says it is.

28:33.921 --> 28:37.382
Then you are not responsible
for what other people do, Buddy.

28:37.466 --> 28:38.466
Just you.

28:59.947 --> 29:01.030
We have a plan.

29:01.323 --> 29:02.865
All we need is a little bit of your time.

29:12.418 --> 29:13.584
It moves, don't it?

29:13.669 --> 29:15.336
This is nothing.

29:17.172 --> 29:19.382
Fancy car, for the dead.

29:20.217 --> 29:22.218
I didn't buy it for them.

29:23.679 --> 29:27.348
I was thinking about your funeral party
before I went to sleep last night.

29:28.183 --> 29:30.393
I think I understand it a little now.

29:32.020 --> 29:36.274
When I was a kid,
my folks died in a bad car wreck.

29:37.943 --> 29:40.820
And the people at the funeral home, well...

29:41.613 --> 29:44.866
They did the impossible,
as far as I was concerned.

29:45.492 --> 29:48.786
I don't know what I would've done
without them.

29:48.871 --> 29:52.582
I remember wishing that
my mother and daddy was there

29:52.666 --> 29:54.167
so they could see how beautiful
they had made it.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.865
- Where'd he go?
- I don't know.

30:35.417 --> 30:36.459
Don't leave me naked here.

30:36.543 --> 30:38.169
I wish you wouldn't do that yet.

30:39.087 --> 30:40.838
Mr. Bush, you can cut all the hairs you want

30:40.923 --> 30:43.090
after we've taken your picture. I'll pay for it.

30:43.175 --> 30:44.383
Well, why you want my picture made?

30:44.468 --> 30:47.470
We're going to run an ad in some papers
about your party.

30:47.554 --> 30:48.596
Hang some posters up of you.

30:48.680 --> 30:50.223
And you want me to look like this.

30:50.307 --> 30:51.349
- Yes.
- Why?

30:51.433 --> 30:52.558
Why?

30:53.268 --> 30:56.479
Well, it's how people recognize you, sir.

30:56.647 --> 30:58.856
And you want as many people
to come as possible,

30:59.149 --> 31:00.900
- so...
- So?

31:01.109 --> 31:04.278
A crazy old nutter draws more.

31:05.572 --> 31:06.572
Don't you think?

31:07.908 --> 31:09.909
You ever say what you mean?

31:44.069 --> 31:45.319
Take it.

31:47.030 --> 31:48.489
Do you want him to smile?

31:48.574 --> 31:50.199
That is his smile.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.789
Well, all right.

31:56.873 --> 32:01.711
Now, Mr. Bush, on the count of three.
One, two...

32:12.431 --> 32:15.016
Damn. You look pretty good.

32:19.438 --> 32:20.688
He pays.

32:28.530 --> 32:31.198
- Well, what do you think?
- I wouldn't know you, sir.

32:31.283 --> 32:33.367
Well, maybe the devil won't, either.

32:34.202 --> 32:35.369
This just might work out.

32:35.996 --> 32:38.581
Wait, now where are the shoes?

32:38.665 --> 32:42.126
Normally, people don't wear shoes
in a casket.

32:47.841 --> 32:49.425
What are you, about 1 0-D?

32:49.509 --> 32:52.511
A suit coat and trousers,
that's going to be $13.19.

32:52.596 --> 32:55.056
And the shoes another $6.50.

32:55.140 --> 32:57.350
It'll be $19.69 total.

32:58.852 --> 33:02.188
- How are you fixed for underwear?
- I don't wear none.

33:04.900 --> 33:06.400
One question too many.

33:12.699 --> 33:16.869
Well, I don't mean to be nosy,
but how do you know Mattie?

33:20.749 --> 33:22.249
We had a go.

33:36.431 --> 33:37.431
Call.

33:38.517 --> 33:40.476
A funeral party?
What the hell's a funeral party, Frank?

33:40.560 --> 33:41.560
You're giving him a party?

33:41.645 --> 33:44.188
If he wants to come to his own funeral,
what am I going to say?

33:44.272 --> 33:48.234
I wish my ex-wife would come to my funeral
so I could tell her to kiss my ass.

33:48.318 --> 33:49.694
What makes you think she'd show up?

33:49.778 --> 33:51.445
That big wad of money of his you're after.

33:52.114 --> 33:53.280
Felix has money?

33:53.365 --> 33:55.908
Yeah, he came to me looking for a funeral.

33:56.368 --> 33:58.285
Had a big, old greasy ball of money.

33:58.620 --> 34:00.538
Talked like he thought he could
buy his way to heaven with it.

34:00.622 --> 34:01.706
Is he sick, Gus?

34:01.957 --> 34:03.708
Sick? He ain't sick.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.210
Ain't nobody going to go to a funeral
for that old son of a bitch.

34:06.294 --> 34:07.837
- Language.
- They might.

34:07.921 --> 34:12.007
He's invited everyone to come
that has a story to tell about him.

34:12.592 --> 34:14.802
You could tell about him
kicking your ass, Carl.

34:16.138 --> 34:17.179
Keep it up, Frank.

34:18.139 --> 34:19.264
You all say what you want to,

34:19.516 --> 34:21.726
but if somebody hadn't been there
the other day, he'd have killed me,

34:21.810 --> 34:23.643
and I guarantee
it wouldn't have been the first time, either.

34:24.146 --> 34:25.103
So y'all go on.

34:25.188 --> 34:27.815
Have your little party
for the devil and his money.

34:30.318 --> 34:32.277
I'm going to dance on his grave some day.

34:42.164 --> 34:43.914
You kind of hate to admit it
when it comes to Carl,

34:43.998 --> 34:45.916
but he's got a point.

34:46.251 --> 34:47.877
And you don't know what Bush is doing.

34:48.085 --> 34:49.795
What if he just wants to get everybody
in one place

34:49.880 --> 34:51.255
so he can turn his shotgun on them?

34:51.422 --> 34:52.505
He wouldn't do that.

34:52.591 --> 34:54.049
I looked in his eyes.

34:54.467 --> 34:56.886
Now, the truth is,
nobody knows what he's capable of.

34:56.969 --> 34:58.429
Maybe even he doesn't know.

35:05.979 --> 35:10.608
You still there?

35:12.402 --> 35:13.861
You better be.

35:19.534 --> 35:23.871
I want you close to me, hear me?
I want you close to me.

35:30.045 --> 35:31.086
Night, Miss Mattie.

35:31.171 --> 35:32.880
- Good night, Gus.
- Night, Frank.

35:40.514 --> 35:41.847
I'll walk you home.

35:41.932 --> 35:44.225
- No, thank you.
- You sure?

35:44.643 --> 35:45.810
Yeah.

35:47.062 --> 35:48.521
You're never going to play anymore,

35:48.605 --> 35:51.065
- are you?
- It's not that. I just...

35:55.529 --> 35:57.696
You came because you don't know
what to do with yourself.

36:00.242 --> 36:03.786
I slept on the same side of the bed
my whole life.

36:05.455 --> 36:07.456
Right after my wife left,

36:08.083 --> 36:10.000
I switched sides, just like that.

36:11.920 --> 36:14.213
And I've never been able to go back.

36:40.407 --> 36:41.782
For heaven's sakes.

37:04.681 --> 37:08.350
Friends, we have a special
treat for you today on WCGM.

37:08.435 --> 37:11.478
Our guest is going to tune us
into the event that everyone's talking about.

37:11.813 --> 37:15.149
And here he is, Mr. Felix Bush,
the mysterious hermit from Caleb County.

37:15.233 --> 37:17.151
How are you today, sir?

37:17.986 --> 37:19.153
I am.

37:20.864 --> 37:24.158
Now, sir, exactly, how did you come up
with the idea of throwing a funeral party

37:24.242 --> 37:25.743
before you die?

37:26.995 --> 37:28.245
I dreamed it.

37:28.330 --> 37:29.371
Really?

37:30.332 --> 37:34.126
I have to say, sir, you don't look
quite like you do on the posters.

37:34.210 --> 37:35.669
I got pruned.

37:36.671 --> 37:38.255
Well, you're a bit of a local legend, sir.

37:38.340 --> 37:42.176
I was a little nervous about our interview.
I've heard some pretty wild stories.

37:43.178 --> 37:44.511
Like what?

37:45.013 --> 37:47.598
Well, just from what I understand,

37:47.682 --> 37:50.392
you want everyone that has a story
to come out and tell it, is that right?

37:50.477 --> 37:52.895
- Well, you come and tell yours.
- Thank you, sir.

37:53.980 --> 37:57.441
Now, how long you been living
out there by yourself?

37:57.525 --> 37:58.525
Forty-some years.

37:59.152 --> 38:01.153
Forty years with nobody to talk to.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.989
The first 38 are the hardest.

38:05.742 --> 38:06.951
Now, why would you do that, Mr. Bush,

38:07.035 --> 38:08.869
shut yourself off like that?

38:10.246 --> 38:11.246
Why?

38:15.502 --> 38:17.711
You come to the funeral,
maybe you'll find out.

38:18.880 --> 38:21.131
We'll find out the answer to the mystery
February 16th.

38:21.216 --> 38:22.257
One more thing, boy.

38:24.386 --> 38:25.511
There's going to be a drawing.

38:26.096 --> 38:27.554
What kind of drawing, sir?

38:27.639 --> 38:29.682
You buy a ticket for $5.

38:30.433 --> 38:33.519
The day of the funeral, we draw names.
Then when I die,

38:33.853 --> 38:35.896
the winner gets my place.

38:37.065 --> 38:41.068
Three-hundred acres of timber
that hasn't been touched in 40 years.

38:42.070 --> 38:43.904
Send it to the Quinn Funeral Home.

38:44.739 --> 38:46.073
For $5?

38:46.700 --> 38:48.575
You heard him say it.
If you want a chance to win

38:48.660 --> 38:51.787
three-hundred acres of virgin timber
worth thousands and thousands of dollars,

38:51.871 --> 38:54.081
please send your name
and address along with $5

38:54.165 --> 38:56.583
to Mr. Frank Quinn at Quinn Funeral Home.

39:00.088 --> 39:01.088
I'll take a ticket.

39:01.172 --> 39:02.881
You're betting on a man dying.

39:03.258 --> 39:04.216
I didn't mean it like that.

39:04.300 --> 39:07.886
- I was just saying since he...
- No, no, it's his idea.

39:08.138 --> 39:09.763
That's what you want, right?

39:11.558 --> 39:14.935
Buy a ticket, son. Tell a story.

39:37.959 --> 39:41.086
Save some for me now. Don't eat it all.
All right.

39:44.966 --> 39:48.761
Who's this?

39:48.845 --> 39:49.970
Felix?

39:52.640 --> 39:53.682
Mattie?

39:56.394 --> 39:57.686
Look at you.

39:58.980 --> 40:01.315
I wondered if you were still under that beard.

40:01.399 --> 40:04.276
Well, I wouldn't know where else to go.

40:06.988 --> 40:08.864
I heard you on the radio.

40:08.990 --> 40:10.365
Yes, ma'am.

40:11.326 --> 40:13.702
You've gotten downright chatty.

40:14.079 --> 40:15.871
Yeah, reckon so.

40:18.374 --> 40:21.126
Well, this is it. This is my barn.

40:21.878 --> 40:24.338
Yeah. This here's my mule, Gracie.

40:25.715 --> 40:27.466
Say hello?

40:27.842 --> 40:29.384
Well, would you like to feed her?

40:30.887 --> 40:33.347
Go ahead. She'll love you for it.

40:33.515 --> 40:35.182
There. Come on, Gracie. Come.

40:36.017 --> 40:38.811
This here's Mattie. Yeah.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.021
Give her some more.

40:42.357 --> 40:46.276
Yeah.

40:47.695 --> 40:52.699
Would you like to see the rest of my place?

40:55.411 --> 40:56.703
Do you want me to?

40:58.039 --> 40:59.706
Yes, ma'am, I do. Yeah.

41:02.168 --> 41:06.213
Yeah. You always know
where you stand with a dog.

41:06.381 --> 41:09.550
Keeper of Charlie and Maude. Yeah.

41:12.554 --> 41:16.557
I wanna lay here with them someday,
if they'll have me.

41:18.184 --> 41:19.184
Yeah.

41:21.104 --> 41:22.980
Well, it really is beautiful.

41:23.064 --> 41:25.315
It probably looked like this everywhere
a hundred years ago.

41:25.400 --> 41:28.610
Well, you leave things alone,
they know what to do.

41:29.737 --> 41:31.363
- Like you?
- No, ma'am.

41:31.447 --> 41:33.240
I don't know what to do
about anything much.

41:34.033 --> 41:36.326
Well, you've been alone a long time.

41:36.411 --> 41:40.247
Well, I guess some people are more suited
to it than others, I reckon.

41:40.623 --> 41:43.041
Funny, I never thought it would suit you.

41:43.126 --> 41:45.836
No one to talk to. No one to be with.

41:45.920 --> 41:49.464
- How you sleeping these days, girl?
- How am I what?

41:49.883 --> 41:50.883
Yeah.

41:51.718 --> 41:53.844
You sleep good?

41:53.928 --> 41:56.763
No, not lately. How did you know?

41:56.848 --> 42:00.184
Well, looky here. Yeah.

42:01.144 --> 42:03.770
Yeah. This is Valerian.

42:04.606 --> 42:07.816
It'll help you nod off
when the nights get long.

42:11.696 --> 42:13.947
Now, you wanna go on aways?

42:14.949 --> 42:17.117
- Yes.
- Okay. Yeah.

42:18.953 --> 42:21.997
Would you stay for supper?

42:24.125 --> 42:25.792
I don't wannabe any trouble.

42:25.877 --> 42:29.963
Well, a supper guest every 30, 40 years
is not much trouble, girl.

42:31.174 --> 42:32.758
All right, then.

42:34.552 --> 42:36.678
Well, you better stay close.

42:37.513 --> 42:42.309
Because some big old wildcat
has been eating my chickens.

42:43.811 --> 42:45.562
Or maybe it was me.

42:48.274 --> 42:50.359
Now, you take that root, and you mash it...

42:54.697 --> 42:56.073
Here we go.

42:59.744 --> 43:01.036
Go on in.

43:02.538 --> 43:05.082
- Give me your coat there.
- Thank you.

43:06.000 --> 43:09.503
It's a little cold here.

43:19.264 --> 43:20.347
Would you care for tea?

43:20.431 --> 43:21.556
Oh, I'd love some, thank you.

43:22.141 --> 43:23.225
Okay.

43:27.897 --> 43:32.401
This is a beautiful table.
You were always good with your hands.

43:35.280 --> 43:36.613
Thank you.

43:40.034 --> 43:41.451
Miss Mattie.

43:59.178 --> 44:02.014
- You still play the piano?
- I teach a few girls.

44:02.682 --> 44:05.309
I got a good feeling when you played.

44:05.727 --> 44:07.561
Remember that time you was playing,

44:07.645 --> 44:10.022
and the lamp burned out,
and you went right on in the dark?

44:11.274 --> 44:13.817
I hear that song sometimes at night.

44:18.406 --> 44:19.489
I do.

44:20.241 --> 44:22.159
Sure is quiet out here.

44:23.244 --> 44:24.911
I said, it sure is...

44:29.334 --> 44:31.752
I tried to write you a few times, but

44:33.171 --> 44:34.671
I didn't know what to say.

44:35.048 --> 44:37.591
- Well, I heard you married.
- Yeah.

44:38.051 --> 44:40.635
To a doctor. A good man.

44:41.429 --> 44:43.847
We lived in St. Louis for a while.

44:45.433 --> 44:51.438
He died about a year ago.
So I came back here because...

44:54.484 --> 44:56.401
I've no idea why.

44:57.028 --> 45:00.072
The list of people who are gone is getting
longer and longer, and it seems like

45:00.615 --> 45:03.950
all I'm doing is just waiting
for my name to be called.

45:04.452 --> 45:07.120
You have a tender heart.
You always did, you know.

45:08.623 --> 45:10.457
You can't wait for anything, Mattie.

45:10.958 --> 45:12.709
Close your eyes, hold your breath,

45:13.878 --> 45:17.547
stay in one spot your whole life,
but you're still moving.

45:18.299 --> 45:22.302
Like the world is, you know,
moving under you. There's no waiting.

45:27.517 --> 45:30.352
And there's no getting over some things,
is there?

45:32.647 --> 45:34.106
Reckon not, Little Bit.

45:34.190 --> 45:35.565
Little Bit.

45:36.234 --> 45:38.985
Oh, my God. I haven't been called that...

46:23.531 --> 46:24.531
Jesus, kid.

46:24.615 --> 46:25.824
Yeah, but it's not our money.

46:25.908 --> 46:29.661
Well, yeah, I know,
but some of it's going to be.

46:29.745 --> 46:31.788
I mean, we're putting this thing on.

46:34.041 --> 46:36.543
Well, he should be here.
I'm going to go get him.

46:52.560 --> 46:55.228
I'm not exactly sure
how much your land is worth.

46:55.313 --> 46:58.565
It looks to me like you could get
10 times that, more.

46:58.900 --> 47:03.570
I mean, it's yours to do with what you want,
but it makes me a little nervous.

47:04.071 --> 47:06.907
I never thought I'd see enough money
to make me nervous.

47:08.409 --> 47:10.577
We should probably talk about
the price of everything.

47:11.913 --> 47:13.205
The clothes, the ads,

47:13.748 --> 47:15.123
our price for everything.

47:15.750 --> 47:17.959
We'll be fair about that.
I'm not worried about it.

47:18.085 --> 47:19.753
Well, what do you think, boy?

47:25.551 --> 47:27.302
Well, money makes people do funny things.

47:28.763 --> 47:30.055
I'd probably put it in the bank, sir.

47:30.139 --> 47:31.681
This bank, here,

47:33.017 --> 47:36.353
you can't trust. That's all I'm going to say.

47:37.605 --> 47:38.772
Can I trust you?

47:41.776 --> 47:43.443
Every name and every dollar is on this table.

47:43.528 --> 47:45.403
That's not what I asked.

47:46.739 --> 47:48.532
I've done a hell of a job for you.

47:50.159 --> 47:51.451
I don't see why...

47:51.536 --> 47:52.661
- Mr. Bush, I didn't mean to imply.
- Hush.

47:52.745 --> 47:54.287
I've sold horses, cars.

47:54.372 --> 47:55.872
I mean, I've sold watches that were

47:55.957 --> 47:57.791
pinned to the inside of my coat.
I'm not ashamed of it.

47:58.167 --> 48:00.001
I don't rob banks. Don't cheat at cards.

48:00.086 --> 48:02.128
I sleep all right, nights I sleep.

48:02.463 --> 48:05.048
Take out for the expenses you already have,
and give me the receipts.

48:05.132 --> 48:07.008
When the bills come in for things,
you give them to me.

48:07.677 --> 48:08.718
I'll pay them.

48:08.803 --> 48:10.053
You put this money in a box.

48:10.137 --> 48:12.180
The boy and I will take it someplace
in the morning.

48:12.265 --> 48:14.432
Whatever new comes in... Listen to me.

48:14.517 --> 48:16.560
Whatever new comes in,
you keep it in the bottom of one of them

48:16.644 --> 48:19.020
ugly caskets in there until I come get it.

48:19.605 --> 48:21.398
When the party's over, you name a fair price

48:21.482 --> 48:23.149
for what you've done, and we'll settle up.

48:24.819 --> 48:25.860
A fair price.

48:42.336 --> 48:46.131
Is it just me, or is he extremely articulate
when he wants to be?

48:46.340 --> 48:48.174
I don't know who's selling
who to what anymore.

48:50.261 --> 48:52.137
It's not clear, is it?

48:55.850 --> 48:57.309
Here you go.

48:59.562 --> 49:01.396
- Where to, sir?
- North.

49:03.065 --> 49:06.151
- How far?
- Till I say, son.

49:11.324 --> 49:13.199
Step on it. Step on it.

49:34.764 --> 49:36.056
Mr. Quinn.

49:55.910 --> 49:57.494
How much further?

49:58.704 --> 49:59.663
What?

49:59.747 --> 50:01.831
How much further you want to go?

50:47.962 --> 50:50.547
- Don't say nothing.
- To who?

50:51.382 --> 50:53.550
You can say "hi." That's it.

50:55.136 --> 51:08.231
Hi.

51:09.150 --> 51:10.316
Hello.

51:17.825 --> 51:20.076
You sure you're in the right place?

51:20.161 --> 51:22.245
Not expecting a funeral.

51:22.329 --> 51:23.455
Hi.

51:29.211 --> 51:30.211
Hey,

51:30.588 --> 51:32.005
Charlie.

51:40.723 --> 51:41.765
Felix?

52:01.368 --> 52:03.161
Yeah. Yeah.

52:04.538 --> 52:06.206
Still standing.

52:06.499 --> 52:07.665
Yeah.

52:11.712 --> 52:14.214
- Reverend Charlie Jackson.
- Hi.

52:15.216 --> 52:18.009
That's Buddy Robinson. He don't talk much.

52:18.093 --> 52:19.719
Well, somebody better talk.

52:20.095 --> 52:23.139
A ghost pulls into the driveway in a hearse,

52:23.224 --> 52:25.391
you expect a little bit of a story.

52:28.229 --> 52:29.229
Well...

52:31.857 --> 52:34.567
You know, my hearing's not what it was.

52:35.069 --> 52:38.613
Sounded like you said you want me
to preach at your funeral party,

52:39.156 --> 52:41.074
with you sitting there.

52:42.243 --> 52:43.576
Yes, sir.

52:45.496 --> 52:48.706
I've talked to God a lot about you
over the years.

52:49.041 --> 52:51.459
He said he broke the mold
when he made you.

52:51.544 --> 52:55.755
Said you're sure entertaining to watch
but way too much trouble.

53:02.221 --> 53:05.223
What would you want me to say
at this funeral?

53:06.308 --> 53:08.852
Say anything you wanna say, Charlie.

53:12.940 --> 53:14.983
Could you give us a minute?

53:15.067 --> 53:16.276
No, sit still.

53:16.360 --> 53:18.194
What's the matter?
You scared to be alone with me?

53:18.279 --> 53:20.989
- No, he can hear what's said.
- All right.

53:22.032 --> 53:24.117
After you left here,
did you do the right thing?

53:26.787 --> 53:30.123
I felt that I did the right thing, yes.

53:32.251 --> 53:35.503
You confessed? Asked forgiveness?

53:39.300 --> 53:41.426
Did you tell her, Felix?

53:47.016 --> 53:50.018
- You've come a long way for nothing, then.
- You self-righteous no...

53:50.102 --> 53:53.229
- Don't you dare.
- No, hey. You listen to me now.

53:53.314 --> 53:56.065
I built my own jail and put myself in it.

53:56.150 --> 53:58.985
And I stayed in it for 40 goddamn years.

54:00.029 --> 54:01.321
No wife.

54:02.072 --> 54:04.490
No kids, no friends, no nothing.

54:05.117 --> 54:06.826
No grandchildren.

54:12.166 --> 54:15.627
I wouldn't even know how to hold a baby.
You hear me?

54:17.421 --> 54:18.671
Forty years.

54:19.757 --> 54:21.674
Now, that's not enough?

54:23.469 --> 54:25.136
You know it's not.

54:27.932 --> 54:30.975
Well, why don't you come
to say that then, Charlie?

54:31.060 --> 54:34.312
Hell, tell it all if you wanna. I don't care.

54:34.939 --> 54:38.191
But just come and say something.

54:40.569 --> 54:42.195
Not on your life.

55:03.884 --> 55:06.177
How much do you know about him?

55:08.097 --> 55:11.265
Almost nothing.
I just work at the funeral home.

55:14.561 --> 55:17.188
Do you know that he built this church?

55:19.525 --> 55:20.566
No.

55:22.236 --> 55:25.905
How could a man like that
build something like this?

55:27.449 --> 55:30.535
I mean,
I knew he was a good carpenter, but...

55:32.413 --> 55:34.288
- But this is...
- Magic?

55:35.958 --> 55:38.084
Maybe it's the best of him.

55:39.336 --> 55:40.753
Maybe...

55:42.172 --> 55:45.133
Maybe he put his soul into it, I don't know.

55:46.635 --> 55:48.886
What y'all were talking about.

55:50.431 --> 55:51.973
What did he do?

55:53.267 --> 55:54.809
Who was he supposed to tell?

55:55.936 --> 55:58.354
Between him and God, I guess.

56:00.607 --> 56:04.193
I will say that he showed up here half dead.

56:05.863 --> 56:07.822
Can I ask you something?

56:08.657 --> 56:10.199
Do you have to?

56:12.536 --> 56:14.787
Yeah. What are we doing?

56:16.206 --> 56:18.041
Ever since the day
you came to the funeral home,

56:18.125 --> 56:21.961
I don't think anything has happened
that you didn't want to happen.

56:22.046 --> 56:24.380
I just don't know where it's going.

56:24.465 --> 56:26.716
There's a whole lot of things
you don't know,

56:26.967 --> 56:30.386
like what a dog dreams.

56:31.138 --> 56:34.182
You can make up a story about him
chasing rabbits.

56:34.266 --> 56:37.894
But you don't know
if there's rabbits in there or not.

56:37.978 --> 56:40.396
And he can't tell you now, can he?

56:42.775 --> 56:45.610
People don't say what they mean, either,
so you don't know anymore about them

56:45.694 --> 56:47.987
than you do about that dog's dream.

56:49.823 --> 56:53.785
That day you left my house,
I saw you stop and look back.

56:53.869 --> 56:56.996
You wanna know
what could make somebody like me.

56:57.539 --> 57:00.917
Well, here you are, son. Here you are.

57:19.853 --> 57:22.396
I better stop and tell Frank we're back.

57:22.481 --> 57:25.983
He's probably thrown
two or three hissy fits by now.

57:26.068 --> 57:29.445
You can stay in the house with me tonight.
I can take you back in the morning.

57:29.530 --> 57:32.824
Well, I haven't stayed with nobody
in a long while.

57:33.367 --> 57:35.118
- Well, it's fine if you want to.
- Yeah.

57:36.036 --> 57:39.122
Wait. Stop. Let me out. Stop the car.

57:39.206 --> 57:40.873
- What?
- Stop it. Let me out.

57:42.084 --> 57:43.459
Let me out!

57:46.004 --> 57:47.755
Put the money in a casket.

57:47.840 --> 57:50.508
You can't walk. It's too far.
You might as well get back in.

57:50.592 --> 57:55.179
- I'm gonna follow you the whole way.
- Get the hell out of here, boy. Go on!

58:20.581 --> 58:25.209
They keep talking about forgiveness,
ask Jesus for forgiveness.

58:28.422 --> 58:30.506
I never did nothing to him.

58:57.242 --> 58:58.451
Frank, I'm back here.

59:04.249 --> 59:05.666
Frank?

59:45.958 --> 59:48.000
Frank. In here.

01:00:00.681 --> 01:00:02.306
Here, follow it.

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:07.561
I'm okay.

01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:11.065
I was putting the money in,

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:14.277
and I heard some glass breaking.

01:00:15.529 --> 01:00:18.197
I locked up the casket and then, boom.

01:00:22.953 --> 01:00:24.453
You did good.

01:00:25.956 --> 01:00:27.748
It didn't feel good.

01:00:48.979 --> 01:00:50.855
Please, Ma'am. Please.

01:01:26.641 --> 01:01:27.767
Thank you.

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:32.980
What are you doing here?

01:01:35.442 --> 01:01:36.609
Can I sit down?

01:01:37.986 --> 01:01:39.362
Yes, Ma'am.

01:01:45.452 --> 01:01:46.577
Now.

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:56.921
You wanna know why
I have your sister's picture on my wall.

01:01:57.506 --> 01:01:58.839
I'm not stupid, Felix.

01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:02.343
I take that back.

01:02:03.804 --> 01:02:05.304
How long was it going on?

01:02:06.139 --> 01:02:07.890
She was already married when I met you.

01:02:07.974 --> 01:02:10.643
Were you just making up to me
to get to her?

01:02:14.398 --> 01:02:16.816
If you're not gonna talk, leave.

01:02:20.821 --> 01:02:23.030
Can you help who you love?

01:02:24.408 --> 01:02:27.952
I've had 40 years to think about it.
I still don't know.

01:02:29.371 --> 01:02:33.541
Now, I'd like to tell you how it was.
Now, if you don't want me to, I'll go.

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:35.584
- Don't lie to me, Felix.
- No, Ma'am.

01:02:45.554 --> 01:02:47.972
When did you take up with her?

01:02:51.435 --> 01:02:53.102
I came to see you.

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:57.898
And she was there, hanging clothes
on the line with your mama.

01:02:58.567 --> 01:03:00.401
She turned around.

01:03:00.819 --> 01:03:06.282
I promise you, I did not know
that I had a heart until right then.

01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:12.413
You was a fine, fine girl.

01:03:12.497 --> 01:03:15.082
I didn't know why you wanted
anything to do with me.

01:03:15.167 --> 01:03:19.253
But I was gonna keep coming
to see you till my luck run out.

01:03:19.337 --> 01:03:20.629
And then...

01:03:20.714 --> 01:03:22.381
- She was married.
- Yeah.

01:03:22.466 --> 01:03:25.176
And she wasn't just my sister.
She was my best friend.

01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:27.511
We told each other everything.

01:03:28.555 --> 01:03:29.597
I can't...

01:03:35.562 --> 01:03:37.396
How long did it go on?

01:03:42.486 --> 01:03:43.736
How long?

01:03:48.575 --> 01:03:50.326
It's still going on.

01:04:02.422 --> 01:04:05.132
Did you have anything to do with her death?

01:04:05.884 --> 01:04:07.134
Her what?

01:04:11.932 --> 01:04:13.224
Tell me.

01:04:18.355 --> 01:04:19.605
Felix.

01:04:21.816 --> 01:04:24.527
Felix, get out of my house.

01:04:27.614 --> 01:04:28.781
Now!

01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:33.452
You go to hell.

01:04:37.123 --> 01:04:39.625
Felix. Felix.

01:04:42.462 --> 01:04:43.963
Take a breath.

01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:52.471
You need to see a doctor.

01:05:44.399 --> 01:05:45.399
Whoa.

01:05:45.483 --> 01:05:46.984
What the hell?

01:05:52.532 --> 01:05:55.701
- What? They get it?
- Buddy sealed it in a casket.

01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:58.746
- Took a crack on the head though.
- Is he all right?

01:05:58.830 --> 01:06:00.122
- Yeah.
- You sure.

01:06:00.206 --> 01:06:02.958
I was an army medic. He'll be fine.

01:06:03.043 --> 01:06:07.421
But you ought to take those clothes back
and get something in your size.

01:06:08.381 --> 01:06:10.215
They get the whiskey?

01:06:22.646 --> 01:06:24.146
Well, I've been thinking.

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:26.690
What if we had the party at your place?

01:06:28.902 --> 01:06:31.403
You know, people will wanna see
the land they're getting.

01:06:31.488 --> 01:06:33.822
I don't know. Don't know.

01:06:33.907 --> 01:06:35.449
Well, it's something to think about.

01:06:35.533 --> 01:06:38.035
- Yeah, well. Don't know.
- We could...

01:06:39.579 --> 01:06:41.747
Don't know that I'm doing it.

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:45.000
What?

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:48.170
I'm thinking of calling it off.

01:06:48.254 --> 01:06:49.838
No. You can't.

01:06:49.923 --> 01:06:51.173
I can do any damn thing I want.

01:06:51.257 --> 01:06:53.342
- No. No.
- I say no, you don't say no.

01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:55.386
Now, goddamn, you send that money back,
all right?

01:06:55.470 --> 01:06:56.679
- You're killing me.
- Oh, yeah?

01:06:56.763 --> 01:06:59.264
I bought things. I've hired people.

01:07:00.308 --> 01:07:01.684
Promised money.

01:07:01.768 --> 01:07:04.436
Everybody in town is hoping to get...

01:07:05.146 --> 01:07:06.855
You know, this thing going. It's big.

01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:10.275
I care about this town
as much as they care about me.

01:07:11.403 --> 01:07:13.862
It's what you said you wanted.

01:07:13.947 --> 01:07:18.450
And I busted my ass for you.
So now, why don't you want it anymore?

01:07:22.288 --> 01:07:27.042
It was the end-of-the-line, tell-it-all,
get-out-of-jail party.

01:07:28.128 --> 01:07:30.796
But I guess I haven't got the goddamn guts
to speak for myself.

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:34.091
And I can't find nobody else
to talk for me, so...

01:07:34.801 --> 01:07:37.010
Hell with it. The hell with me.

01:07:38.346 --> 01:07:40.139
Step back. Thank you.

01:08:02.454 --> 01:08:03.954
Can't you see?

01:08:04.873 --> 01:08:06.206
I see that you're mad.

01:08:06.332 --> 01:08:08.500
I'm not mad. I'm concerned.

01:08:12.005 --> 01:08:13.505
No, you're mad.

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:20.220
If I could get my hands on whoever
did that to you, you could see mad.

01:08:22.432 --> 01:08:23.682
Buddy, you up?

01:08:24.768 --> 01:08:25.850
Yeah.

01:08:26.435 --> 01:08:27.478
Trouble.

01:08:27.562 --> 01:08:29.229
What's the matter?

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:31.814
Bush is pulling out.

01:08:31.899 --> 01:08:33.358
- What?
- What happened yesterday?

01:08:33.443 --> 01:08:36.111
Well, I told you.
We went to Illinois to see a preacher.

01:08:36.196 --> 01:08:37.279
Yeah, but what happened?

01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:40.365
Well, he wanted the preacher
to come to the funeral. And he said no.

01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:42.743
Son of a bitch. That's gotta be it.

01:08:45.705 --> 01:08:47.790
Sorry. Sorry.

01:08:48.707 --> 01:08:51.542
- All right, where's the preacher?
- It won't do you any good.

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:52.877
Why not?

01:08:53.337 --> 01:08:57.508
Well, he knows something about Bush,
and it's something bad, I think.

01:08:57.591 --> 01:09:00.219
Well, if Bush wants him,
by God, Bush is gonna get him.

01:09:00.303 --> 01:09:02.763
You want eggs, Frank, or will the skillet do?

01:09:03.389 --> 01:09:04.389
What?

01:09:04.474 --> 01:09:05.765
My husband has his head bashed in,

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:07.475
and all you care about is this party.

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:09.560
That's not how it is, Katie.

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:11.563
It's not like that. This is for all of us.

01:09:11.898 --> 01:09:13.899
You're like family to me.

01:09:14.399 --> 01:09:16.484
Well, this isn't how family acts.

01:09:22.242 --> 01:09:23.575
I'm sorry.

01:09:25.662 --> 01:09:27.246
I haven't had any practice.

01:09:39.926 --> 01:09:42.426
Stay out of her way today, partner.

01:10:13.710 --> 01:10:16.378
That's good. Do it one more time, honey.

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:29.600
Reverend Jackson?

01:10:31.019 --> 01:10:33.437
Frank Quinn. Quinn Funeral Home.

01:10:33.521 --> 01:10:36.481
I was gonna play some dominos
this afternoon.

01:10:36.983 --> 01:10:39.943
But something told me to stay home.

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:42.571
I should have played dominos.

01:10:44.824 --> 01:10:47.159
- Is he out there?
- Bush? No, sir.

01:10:48.494 --> 01:10:49.786
You sure?

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:51.747
Pretty sure.

01:10:51.831 --> 01:10:53.749
Did you check the back?

01:11:04.636 --> 01:11:06.428
You told Bush
you wouldn't come to the funeral?

01:11:06.512 --> 01:11:09.765
If he got that, why are you here?

01:11:09.849 --> 01:11:12.392
First off, Bush doesn't know that I'm here.

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:14.978
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

01:11:15.521 --> 01:11:17.773
He has a way of making people do
what he wants.

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:23.195
Is he really a hermit?

01:11:33.915 --> 01:11:37.668
He came to see me after he'd been here.
Wants to cancel the party.

01:11:37.752 --> 01:11:38.794
I don't care.

01:11:38.878 --> 01:11:42.381
He said he wanted an end-of-the-line,
tell-it-all, get-out-of-jail funeral.

01:11:42.465 --> 01:11:45.634
But that he didn't have the guts
to open his mouth.

01:11:45.718 --> 01:11:48.595
And he couldn't get anybody to talk for him.

01:11:49.389 --> 01:11:53.016
At first, he wanted anybody with a story
about him to come.

01:11:53.101 --> 01:11:56.353
But he didn't wanna hear
their bullshit stories.

01:11:56.437 --> 01:11:57.980
Pardon my language.

01:11:58.064 --> 01:11:59.189
He wants to tell one.

01:11:59.273 --> 01:12:00.649
About time.

01:12:00.733 --> 01:12:05.112
Whatever he did has been locked up
in him for 40 years. He can't get it out.

01:12:05.697 --> 01:12:08.323
I think he told you,
and he wants you to tell it for him.

01:12:08.408 --> 01:12:09.408
Because he won't.

01:12:09.575 --> 01:12:10.575
Or can't.

01:12:11.244 --> 01:12:12.619
Or won't.

01:12:14.372 --> 01:12:15.706
Or can't.

01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:19.501
At least he wants to get the truth out.

01:12:20.294 --> 01:12:21.461
Give him that.

01:12:22.422 --> 01:12:24.339
I'll think about it.

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:29.011
- Is there a boarding house near here?
- I said I'd think.

01:12:29.095 --> 01:12:32.097
But if you're not coming, I'm not going back.

01:12:33.016 --> 01:12:35.976
I made promises I can't keep
to people I care about.

01:12:37.603 --> 01:12:40.480
This falls apart,
nobody's gonna blame Bush.

01:12:42.984 --> 01:12:45.110
Bank will take my business.

01:12:47.321 --> 01:12:51.575
If I'm gonna have to start over again,
it might as well be from here.

01:13:56.015 --> 01:13:57.182
What are you doing, sir?

01:13:59.143 --> 01:14:01.728
Getting me a suntan.

01:14:08.069 --> 01:14:09.152
You stuck?

01:14:09.403 --> 01:14:12.114
You have no goddamn idea
how right you are, boy.

01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:16.868
I'll sit here a minute.

01:14:17.203 --> 01:14:18.453
How's your head?

01:14:21.499 --> 01:14:23.625
- It's all right.
- Yeah?

01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:25.585
Well, we're a pair, ain't we?

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:31.216
You know who hurt you?

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:32.551
No, sir.

01:14:32.927 --> 01:14:34.553
Sons of bitches.

01:14:39.725 --> 01:14:40.976
You sick?

01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:43.979
Just going through the motions.

01:14:44.730 --> 01:14:48.150
- What does that mean?
- There's alive and there's dead.

01:14:48.734 --> 01:14:51.570
And there's a worse place in between them

01:14:52.697 --> 01:14:54.698
that I hope you never know nothing about.

01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:02.414
Listen, Frank went somewhere,

01:15:03.583 --> 01:15:05.417
and the money's gone.

01:15:10.923 --> 01:15:12.591
You figure he took off with it?

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:14.759
I don't wanna think that.

01:15:15.803 --> 01:15:18.013
But the money's not in the casket.

01:15:18.097 --> 01:15:20.432
He said he was gonna call,
and I ain't heard from him.

01:15:25.813 --> 01:15:28.440
Well, what do you wanna do?

01:15:35.698 --> 01:15:38.450
I wanna make you a funeral,
if you still want one.

01:15:47.668 --> 01:15:49.836
Well, do it if you want to.

01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:57.010
I guess, for everyone like me,

01:15:58.054 --> 01:16:00.096
there's one like you, son.

01:16:02.475 --> 01:16:04.267
I 'bout forgot that.

01:16:41.347 --> 01:16:43.265
I'm glad you decided to come, sir.

01:16:43.891 --> 01:16:46.393
Free will is not all it's cracked up to be.

01:16:46.686 --> 01:16:49.479
Did you take the money out of the casket?

01:16:50.773 --> 01:16:51.773
Yeah.

01:16:52.108 --> 01:16:54.109
Well, why didn't you tell me?

01:16:55.569 --> 01:16:56.903
I forgot.

01:16:58.656 --> 01:17:00.073
You forgot?

01:17:02.368 --> 01:17:03.535
Well, where is it?

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:05.996
It's in the hearse under the floorboards.

01:17:08.749 --> 01:17:11.418
What? Nobody steals a hearse.

01:17:13.212 --> 01:17:16.256
Now, all we gotta do
is get the preacher over to Bush and...

01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:20.093
Yeah, I forgot to tell you,
Bush already said he'd do it.

01:17:21.721 --> 01:17:23.555
Where can I catch a train?

01:17:23.639 --> 01:17:25.307
You can't leave. You just got here.

01:17:25.391 --> 01:17:27.017
Watch and learn.

01:17:28.728 --> 01:17:30.186
You might need two canes.

01:17:30.271 --> 01:17:31.730
Where's the train station?

01:17:31.814 --> 01:17:33.940
Sure you wouldn't rather have a drink first?

01:17:34.025 --> 01:17:35.650
I am out of here.

01:18:04.347 --> 01:18:06.056
Expecting a crowd?

01:18:48.474 --> 01:18:52.477
You asked for it,
you old ornery son of a bitch. Yeah.

01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:55.814
But what are you gonna do now?

01:19:56.375 --> 01:19:58.042
Pretty nice jail.

01:19:59.795 --> 01:20:01.754
Why'd you change your mind, Charlie?

01:20:07.011 --> 01:20:08.344
Thank you.

01:20:10.181 --> 01:20:11.264
How do you wanna do this?

01:20:11.348 --> 01:20:12.682
I don't.

01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:16.227
I'm gonna try and tell it, Charlie. I really am.

01:20:16.312 --> 01:20:18.396
But if I can't get it done, would you do it?

01:20:19.023 --> 01:20:20.815
I want it said, so...

01:20:21.442 --> 01:20:22.859
Please, sir.

01:20:29.366 --> 01:20:31.034
Tell them the box is in the barn.

01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:21.793
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

01:21:21.877 --> 01:21:24.587
I'm Frank Quinn of Quinn Funeral Home.

01:21:25.339 --> 01:21:27.006
Welcome

01:21:27.091 --> 01:21:29.050
to the live funeral party

01:21:30.344 --> 01:21:31.636
of Mr. Felix Bush.

01:21:35.182 --> 01:21:38.935
I've done a lot of things in my life,
but I've never done this.

01:21:39.019 --> 01:21:41.312
I bet none of you have, either.

01:21:41.981 --> 01:21:43.314
I bet no one has.

01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:48.486
The person that made all this happen for us
doesn't like the spotlight.

01:21:49.113 --> 01:21:50.989
But Mr. Buddy Robinson

01:21:51.657 --> 01:21:53.741
is the heart of Quinn Funeral Home,

01:21:54.535 --> 01:21:55.868
and I'm proud to know him.

01:21:58.455 --> 01:22:00.540
Many of you have heard stories
about Mr. Bush.

01:22:02.626 --> 01:22:05.878
But today, I'm told that we're going to hear
another kind of story.

01:22:09.967 --> 01:22:10.967
His.

01:22:58.724 --> 01:22:59.807
Yeah.

01:23:05.939 --> 01:23:07.690
I'm Reverend Charlie Jackson.

01:23:11.070 --> 01:23:12.695
We like to imagine that

01:23:13.447 --> 01:23:14.906
good and bad,

01:23:15.991 --> 01:23:18.117
right and wrong

01:23:19.578 --> 01:23:21.245
are miles apart.

01:23:21.664 --> 01:23:23.289
But the truth is,

01:23:23.957 --> 01:23:27.960
very often, they're all tangled up
with each other.

01:23:28.796 --> 01:23:30.421
Some 40 years ago,

01:23:31.173 --> 01:23:33.675
Felix dropped into my life.

01:23:36.595 --> 01:23:39.597
And then he dropped out.

01:23:40.724 --> 01:23:42.100
In Between,

01:23:43.769 --> 01:23:46.604
he built the most beautiful

01:23:48.399 --> 01:23:52.068
sanctuary that I have ever seen.

01:23:59.326 --> 01:24:01.911
A lot of wonderful things happened
in that church.

01:24:03.789 --> 01:24:06.874
That's it, Charlie. Thank you, Charlie.
Thank you very much.

01:24:06.959 --> 01:24:09.836
You're a good man, Charlie. Thank you.

01:24:10.295 --> 01:24:11.379
Yeah.

01:24:19.221 --> 01:24:24.308
I had to go clear to Illinois to find somebody
who had anything good to say about me.

01:24:24.393 --> 01:24:26.269
Hell of a thing. Yeah.

01:24:31.483 --> 01:24:32.483
So.

01:24:40.325 --> 01:24:41.492
Now...

01:24:42.828 --> 01:24:47.415
I'm not a smart man or a wise one.
I don't know what kind of man I am.

01:24:47.499 --> 01:24:50.668
I was always restless.
Thought I'd see the world.

01:24:52.171 --> 01:24:54.964
But I didn't go nowhere on purpose because

01:24:55.799 --> 01:24:58.176
I did something I was ashamed of.

01:25:00.012 --> 01:25:02.180
Something I could never fix.

01:25:03.098 --> 01:25:05.349
Y'all probably think you know
what you'd do, or what you wouldn't,

01:25:05.434 --> 01:25:08.519
and I wish you good luck with that.
I really do.

01:25:09.563 --> 01:25:12.023
When I told Charlie what I'd done,

01:25:13.150 --> 01:25:16.527
he told me to confess to God and the law...

01:25:16.612 --> 01:25:19.989
You know, somebody else,
so I could get forgiveness.

01:25:21.116 --> 01:25:23.868
But I didn't want forgiveness. No.

01:25:25.829 --> 01:25:28.289
I needed to hold on to what I did,

01:25:28.373 --> 01:25:30.875
to be sick from it every day of my life.

01:25:30.959 --> 01:25:34.212
So that I never told nobody else, you see.

01:25:36.006 --> 01:25:37.215
Nobody.

01:25:56.068 --> 01:26:00.071
I fell in love with a married lady,
and somehow, she fell in love with me.

01:26:05.118 --> 01:26:07.829
The only time that I have been in love.

01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:13.501
We made a plan to run off
and start a new life, a family.

01:26:14.086 --> 01:26:15.461
But somehow,

01:26:16.421 --> 01:26:19.298
she didn't show up when we said we'd meet.

01:26:20.092 --> 01:26:21.634
And I got a funny feeling.

01:26:28.725 --> 01:26:31.978
Her husband answered the door.
He had blood on him.

01:26:33.272 --> 01:26:36.190
I hit him pretty hard and knocked him down.

01:26:36.984 --> 01:26:41.362
I can't remember going upstairs.
I remember there was a hammer on the steps

01:26:41.446 --> 01:26:44.073
that was covered with blood and hair.

01:26:45.576 --> 01:26:49.203
And I found her in the Bedroom,
crawling across the floor.

01:26:49.788 --> 01:26:52.290
Before I could get to her and help her up,

01:26:53.375 --> 01:26:56.210
a kerosene lamp hit the wall and exploded.

01:26:57.254 --> 01:26:59.380
And then her husBand,
he jumped on my back.

01:26:59.506 --> 01:27:03.009
Boy, I had him. Boy, I had... I had him.

01:27:08.807 --> 01:27:11.475
But it's funny what happens, sometimes,
when things go wrong.

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:13.603
It's like the clock stops.

01:27:15.188 --> 01:27:18.316
And you have all the time in the world
to think.

01:27:19.943 --> 01:27:24.113
I could see that her husband set
the downstairs on fire before he came up,

01:27:24.197 --> 01:27:25.615
you see.

01:27:25.699 --> 01:27:29.911
And as I was slamming his head
into the wall, trying to get shed of him,

01:27:29.995 --> 01:27:32.330
it came to me clear as anything,

01:27:34.791 --> 01:27:38.002
that this was all my fault.

01:27:40.172 --> 01:27:41.547
If I'd just

01:27:43.258 --> 01:27:45.009
never spoke to her.

01:27:46.929 --> 01:27:49.847
And as I was thinking about that,
I could see the lamp that he threw,

01:27:49.932 --> 01:27:54.101
it set the room we were in on fire, too.
And then I realized that...

01:27:55.395 --> 01:27:57.188
That I was on fire.

01:28:03.153 --> 01:28:04.695
Tried to put myself out. I couldn't.

01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:08.908
I dropped him, I turned around,
and I was so confused.

01:28:09.868 --> 01:28:12.870
And I looked down,
and I saw her lying on the floor,

01:28:13.038 --> 01:28:15.289
and I called out her name.

01:28:15.374 --> 01:28:17.500
You know her name, Mattie.

01:28:17.876 --> 01:28:21.379
Mary Lee.
Sometimes I called her Mary Lou for fun.

01:28:24.216 --> 01:28:27.134
And then I called out her name again and...

01:28:32.766 --> 01:28:34.225
I could see

01:28:42.776 --> 01:28:44.443
that my only love,

01:28:45.237 --> 01:28:46.821
and your sister,

01:28:48.031 --> 01:28:49.407
was on fire.

01:28:50.575 --> 01:28:51.575
And...

01:28:53.537 --> 01:28:58.040
I'm so ashamed.

01:29:02.421 --> 01:29:06.132
I reached down, and I tried to help her up.

01:29:07.759 --> 01:29:09.760
And the next thing I knew,

01:29:11.638 --> 01:29:14.181
I was flying, you see.

01:29:15.642 --> 01:29:16.726
Yeah.

01:29:18.603 --> 01:29:20.062
I was flying.

01:29:23.859 --> 01:29:26.527
I don't know how I got out the window.

01:29:26.611 --> 01:29:30.614
No matter how many times I play it
in my mind, I can't rememberjumping.

01:29:30.699 --> 01:29:34.785
I thought I killed him.
But maybe he pushed me. I don't know, see.

01:29:36.788 --> 01:29:38.539
But I swear to you,

01:29:41.835 --> 01:29:43.711
if I left her in there,

01:29:45.005 --> 01:29:47.798
everything I know about myself is a lie.

01:29:49.301 --> 01:29:51.010
But that don't matter.

01:29:51.303 --> 01:29:52.970
That don't matter.

01:29:56.099 --> 01:29:59.560
I didn't get her out, Little Bit, I didn't.
I'm sorry.

01:30:04.483 --> 01:30:05.775
And that's my story.

01:30:08.528 --> 01:30:11.989
I would like forgiveness now, if possible.

01:30:13.533 --> 01:30:14.825
And then,

01:30:16.703 --> 01:30:19.497
I don't mind dying for real next time.

01:30:23.043 --> 01:30:24.919
But please forgive me.

01:32:08.815 --> 01:32:10.107
I wonder

01:32:17.449 --> 01:32:19.617
if her hair would be white.

01:32:22.454 --> 01:32:25.623
I wonder. Yeah.

01:33:30.647 --> 01:33:34.066
My funeral, and everybody's in there but me.

01:34:14.357 --> 01:34:18.610
Well, Felix, I guess this one's for real.

01:34:19.738 --> 01:34:23.115
Now, I didn't see them
put you in that box, actually.

01:34:23.408 --> 01:34:24.533
So...

01:34:29.164 --> 01:34:31.040
So wherever you are...

01:34:33.126 --> 01:34:35.586
Probably giving someone a hard time,

01:34:36.421 --> 01:34:40.424
or something wonderful

01:34:41.134 --> 01:34:44.261
or priceless. Just to confuse them.

01:34:46.014 --> 01:34:47.348
I wish you

01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:50.267
peace

01:34:50.769 --> 01:34:54.271
from the burdens of your mind and heart.

01:34:56.441 --> 01:34:58.275
I wish it for us all.
