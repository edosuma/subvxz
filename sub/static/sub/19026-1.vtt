WEBVTT

00:04.281 --> 00:05.981
My shift hasn't started
yet. Try that guy.

00:05.982 --> 00:07.080
Who, that guy right there?

00:07.081 --> 00:07.864
Yeah.

00:07.865 --> 00:08.619
All right, thank you.

00:10.256 --> 00:11.981
A lot's been going on around
here the last two weeks.

00:11.982 --> 00:15.073
Turk and Carla got married,
that short guy hurt his hand...

00:15.828 --> 00:18.828
And since I totally broke Elliot's heart,
I was still trying to smooth things over.

00:18.829 --> 00:21.359
Hey, buddy. What's
with the giant needle?

00:27.311 --> 00:28.377
We still had some work to do.

00:31.011 --> 00:34.148
Where was I? Oh, yeah. The hospital
also had a new attending psychologist.

00:36.187 --> 00:39.245
Dr... Molly... Clock.

00:44.838 --> 00:46.071
This is a really windy hospital.

00:46.072 --> 00:49.564
Oh, I'm sorry. I was
drying up a patient's urine.

00:49.565 --> 00:51.078
Hmm.

00:51.079 --> 00:53.079
I'm kind of a
favorite around here!

00:53.080 --> 00:57.275
Not only was Dr. Clock easy on the eyes,
but apparently she was an excellent shrink.

00:57.276 --> 01:00.858
Mr. Witcomb is in the middle of a psychotic
break from self-discontinuation of his meds,

01:00.859 --> 01:02.854
so we need to get him
on Haloperidol IV stat.

01:02.855 --> 01:04.807
But I also heard she was a little spacy.

01:04.808 --> 01:06.541
So where were we?

01:07.582 --> 01:09.589
Um... we weren't talking.

01:09.590 --> 01:13.104
Was it 'cause of something you did, 'cause I am
totally over it. I don't even remember what it was.

01:13.105 --> 01:15.708
No, I mean like we've
never talked... ever.

01:15.709 --> 01:17.145
Well how do I know your name, then?

01:17.146 --> 01:18.102
You don't.

01:18.103 --> 01:19.449
You're freakin' me out, Jimmy!

01:19.450 --> 01:20.337
It's Johnny.

01:20.338 --> 01:22.124
Why would you say
"Johnny"? You hate "Johnny"!

01:22.125 --> 01:23.954
Now I'm gonna commit
it to my memory forever.

01:26.028 --> 01:27.627
Johnny... Johnny... Johnny...

01:27.628 --> 01:28.753
Dammit! Dammit! Dammit!

01:29.580 --> 01:30.232
Okay,
Johnny...

01:30.233 --> 01:31.151
Dammit!

01:31.152 --> 01:33.432
I'm sorry, I'm just meeting so many
people, and everyone's kind of cliquish

01:33.433 --> 01:34.946
and I haven't really
gotten to know anybody.

01:34.947 --> 01:37.172
So let's talk! It's not like
I'm going anywhere, right?

01:37.173 --> 01:39.083
Great! Oh,
thanks. Okay.

01:41.150 --> 01:41.759
'Scuse me.

01:42.872 --> 01:44.251
Turk's back from his honeymoon!

01:47.135 --> 01:48.045
Nice to meet you...!

01:49.731 --> 01:51.291
TURK! HEY!

01:53.778 --> 01:54.527
Go ahead.

01:54.528 --> 01:56.135
JAAAAAAAY DEEEEEEEE!

01:58.508 --> 01:59.471
Whooooa, J.D.! J.D.!

02:00.612 --> 02:02.364
Maybe some day he'll love me like that.

02:03.874 --> 02:05.375
He's here! TURK!

02:07.038 --> 02:08.143
JAAAAAAAY DEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!

02:09.441 --> 02:10.562
TUUUUUUUUUUUURK!

02:15.717 --> 02:16.419
TURK?!

02:16.420 --> 02:17.494
J.D.!

02:20.368 --> 02:21.056
J.D.?!

02:21.057 --> 02:22.149
TURK!

02:24.556 --> 02:25.276
DUDE!

02:25.277 --> 02:26.915
Stay right there! I'm so excited!

02:30.521 --> 02:31.913
AWWWW, HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

02:31.914 --> 02:32.896
The roof!

02:32.897 --> 02:34.248
I'LL HOLLA!

02:34.249 --> 02:37.650
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, FROM NOW ON,
WE'RE CALLING THIS "ROOF A".

02:37.651 --> 02:38.776
GOT IT!

TURK!

02:55.921 --> 03:00.646
Well, well, well... What do we have
here? The newlyweds! Oh, and, hey Carla.

03:00.647 --> 03:06.648
Mark my words, the first year of marriage is just
a real treat! Sweetheart, do you remember ours?

03:06.649 --> 03:08.767
The silly fighting for control!

03:08.768 --> 03:10.258
You broke my jaw!

03:10.259 --> 03:12.704
You gotta stop that back-talk
early. Come on, glass jaw.

03:12.705 --> 03:17.973
Duck and move, Gandhi. Here it is, here
it is, watch it - ohhhh, duck and move.

03:17.974 --> 03:23.688
Ignore him, baby. We have a great
relationship. Nothing's gonna change.

03:24.811 --> 03:27.004
Over the next few days, Carla
started to change everything.

03:29.672 --> 03:31.755
Hey, dude, get us some more ice cream.

03:31.756 --> 03:39.543
First of all, this is a Rice Dream - mm, ricey -
secondly, I can't get out of these new chairs she got.

03:39.544 --> 03:40.728
Am I using it right?

03:40.729 --> 03:45.873
These bowls Carla bought don't hold a lot of
Rice Dream. I can barely get my spoon in it. Look.

03:45.874 --> 03:49.017
Hey, J.D.? Although we do
appreciate the wedding gift...

03:49.994 --> 03:52.650
Turk and I decided we don't want
this Sugar Hill Gang alarm clock.

03:52.651 --> 03:53.709
We don't?

03:56.349 --> 03:56.933
I got it.

03:58.542 --> 04:01.569
Whoa. I got it. I'm okay. I
don't... here it goes. Whoa!

04:01.570 --> 04:05.716
I'm still in the chair!
It's like a bear-trap!

04:08.678 --> 04:13.228
As I fondled Katya, my pillow girlfriend, I
thought about how things had changed for all of us.

04:13.229 --> 04:17.755
You see, I had almost forgotten that when I wake
up, it'll be the start of my last week as a resident.

04:39.994 --> 04:40.904
Snooze!

Please please please please please please
please please please please please please please!

05:10.656 --> 05:11.964
Proceed unmolested.

05:11.965 --> 05:15.840
I knew he'd buy it, because today feels
like one of those great days in the hospital.

05:15.841 --> 05:17.894
People really seem to be
getting to know each other.

05:17.895 --> 05:20.623
Bob, Bob, Bob... Bob... Bob...

05:20.624 --> 05:22.827
Fantastic. Get off my face.

05:24.330 --> 05:28.186
My last week of residency had begun. In
seven days I'd be a full-fledged doctor.

05:28.187 --> 05:32.417
It felt pretty special to me, and I had a hunch
it meant a lot to one other person as well.

05:32.418 --> 05:34.399
Yes, milady?

05:34.400 --> 05:37.462
Sooo, ya felling all, like, blalala!

05:37.463 --> 05:41.023
That depends, does "blalalala" mean
confused and incredibly annoyed?

05:41.024 --> 05:45.497
Come on, man, it's our last week together! The
J.D. and Cox train is pulling into the station.

05:45.498 --> 05:48.621
You must have a metaphor you
want to use; hit me with it!

05:48.622 --> 05:54.073
I suppose I could riff a list of things that I
care as little about as our last week together.

05:54.074 --> 06:01.198
Lemme see, uhh... Low-carb diets. Michael
Moore. The Republican National Convention.

06:01.199 --> 06:07.593
Kabbalah and all Kabbalah-related products.
Hi-def TV, the Bush daughters, wireless hot spots,

06:07.594 --> 06:11.981
'The O.C.', the U.N., recycling, getting Punk'd,
Danny Gans, the Latin Grammys, the real Grammys.

06:11.982 --> 06:17.052
Jeff, that Wiggle who sleeps too darn much! The Yankees
payroll, all the red states, all the blue states,

06:17.053 --> 06:20.889
every hybrid car, every talk show host! Everything
on the planet, everything in the solar system,

06:20.890 --> 06:26.019
everything everything everything everything
everything everything that exists - past, present

06:26.020 --> 06:28.723
and future, in all discovered
and undiscovered dimensions.

06:30.798 --> 06:33.304
Oh! And Hugh Jackman.

06:35.493 --> 06:38.504
Hugh Jackman's Wolverine! How dare he.

06:39.761 --> 06:40.747
I missed you guys so much.

06:40.748 --> 06:43.367
Oh, come over tonight!
We're looking at wedding pictures.

06:44.927 --> 06:48.510
Ooh! There's this one picture of me right after
I got sick off my... third champagne and Red Bull,

06:48.511 --> 06:52.248
and my hair is kind of like sexy-messy,
and the photographer said he could airbrush

06:52.249 --> 06:53.416
all of the puke off my dress.

06:53.417 --> 06:54.482
Already made doubles.

06:54.483 --> 07:00.062
You rock! So, is
J.D. gonna be there tonight?

07:00.063 --> 07:01.571
Can't you come over anyway?

07:01.572 --> 07:02.721
Um...

07:03.856 --> 07:06.779
Hey! Do you guys mind if I eat with
you? 'Cause I don't wanna sit alone

07:06.780 --> 07:08.366
and sing to my food like a crazy person.

07:08.367 --> 07:10.334
Oh, my gosh! I do that!

07:10.335 --> 07:11.364
No way!

07:11.365 --> 07:14.262
Mostly pop songs. You know,
unless I'm eating soul food.

07:15.310 --> 07:16.022
Where's your food?

07:16.023 --> 07:16.921
Oh, shoot.

07:16.922 --> 07:20.370
Look, Elliot, we'll do something
later this week, just the two of us.

07:21.752 --> 07:22.432
Okay.

07:24.539 --> 07:27.072
Ahh. Oh, that is not my food.
But I'm not getting up again.

07:27.073 --> 07:28.201
Oh, I wouldn't.

07:28.202 --> 07:31.377
Chicken salaaaad! Oh, yeeah. Looks good.

07:34.505 --> 07:36.053
I gotta go. See ya.

07:38.964 --> 07:42.705
It's so strange feeling all alone when like a month
ago I was part of this really tight group, you know?

07:43.856 --> 07:45.571
Yeah. I had tons of
friends at my old hospital.

07:46.812 --> 07:47.656
I gotta meet some new people.

07:48.599 --> 07:50.539
Do you wanna, uh, get
a cup of coffee tonight?

07:51.403 --> 07:54.270
Can't. I'm hitting the internet
hard and going on a friend hunt!

07:57.287 --> 08:01.888
Oh, chicken salaaad! You're tasty,
you're food to be eaten, it's good!

08:04.266 --> 08:08.549
When you get back from surgery, Mrs. Grodberg, we'll
play Scrabble again! And this time I'll beat you!

08:08.550 --> 08:12.425
Well, of course you'll beat her, son, she's
having half her brain removed! Heh-heh!

08:14.608 --> 08:16.957
J.D. A little problem
this morning with Malik.

08:18.181 --> 08:19.120
Our car? Is it bad?

08:22.548 --> 08:25.829
Hey, Triple A? Look, I need a
pick-up on the corner of Fourth and-

08:30.523 --> 08:33.275
You know what? You'll see it.

08:34.270 --> 08:37.054
Ah, Malik. Lots of
memories in that old car.

08:37.980 --> 08:38.337
Of what?

08:38.337 --> 08:39.754
Driving, mostly.

08:40.577 --> 08:41.390
Beep, beep.

08:41.390 --> 08:45.635
Look, why don't we pool our money together and
buy one of those nice cute little Mini Coopers?

08:46.754 --> 08:47.642
Baby, a Mini Cooper?

08:48.611 --> 08:49.916
And then the most
amazing thing happened.

08:49.917 --> 08:53.948
I'll tell you what, Turk. Why
don't you go pick out our car.

08:55.020 --> 08:56.621
Carla let Turk make a decision!

08:58.554 --> 09:02.317
Okay! But, baby, you should know that it's not gonna
be a Mini. 'Cause ain't nothing really mini about me!

09:02.318 --> 09:03.427
There isn't.

09:03.428 --> 09:04.911
There isn't! Heh!

09:09.604 --> 09:11.836
Mr. Radford, if you keep turning
down physical therapy, you're never

09:11.837 --> 09:13.442
gonna be strong enough
to get out of this bed.

09:14.294 --> 09:15.002
I'm tired.

09:15.003 --> 09:17.378
I know you are, but I would
love it if you'd at least try.

09:17.379 --> 09:31.467
"And I would do anything for love, but
I won't do that. No, I won't do that. "

09:31.468 --> 09:32.478
Haunting.

09:33.440 --> 09:34.392
Drink your juice, Mr. Blass.

09:36.118 --> 09:39.108
Mr. Blass has Pick's disease, which is similar
to presentation to multi-infarct dementia.

09:39.109 --> 09:40.108
Mmm.

09:40.109 --> 09:42.738
Anyhoo, he likes to sing when he gets up in
the morning, and the weird thing is, Johnny,

09:42.739 --> 09:44.985
he actually captures
the mood of the room.

09:44.986 --> 09:47.712
Okay, you gotta take a stand on this
"Johnny" thing before it becomes permanent.

09:47.713 --> 09:52.897
You know what, it's "J.D." for "John Dorian," so
John... look, you know what, Johnny's fine, it's cool.

09:52.898 --> 09:53.934
What's wrong with you?

09:53.935 --> 09:57.212
Anyway, Johnny, I was noticing that you were having
some trouble motivating your patient back in there,

09:57.213 --> 10:01.127
and I actually published a paper on motivation
methodology in post-operative seniors,

10:01.128 --> 10:03.235
so, if you want, I could help.

10:03.236 --> 10:04.253
What floor?

10:04.254 --> 10:06.232
Oh, my god, we're on an elevator.

10:07.784 --> 10:11.281
You know, Molly, I appreciate the offer, but
there's a very special doctor I use around here

10:11.282 --> 10:14.353
when I need help, and he'd be pretty
pissed if I didn't come to him first.

10:15.645 --> 10:19.050
Why, Mariska? Why do you insist
on bothering me with these things?

10:19.051 --> 10:22.443
Please, you know you love it. Now, come
on, one more time for nostalgia's sake:

10:22.444 --> 10:25.879
You come see my patient, you teach me a
lesson, and then the music plays, right?

10:25.880 --> 10:33.876
In my head, it sounds like this...

10:35.070 --> 10:36.247
Dr. Cox, can I borrow you for a minute?

10:36.248 --> 10:42.539
Borrow me? Dearheart, you'd be rescuing me.
Newbie, you're on your own. Get used to it.

10:56.206 --> 10:59.066
I'munna prove to you why my first year of
marriage isn't gonna be as hard as yours was.

10:59.067 --> 11:01.493
I think you're setting the bar a little
low on that one, there, sweetcheeks.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.318
Yeah, still, the point
is I'm smarter than you.

11:03.319 --> 11:04.302
In relationships?

11:04.303 --> 11:05.125
In everything.

11:05.126 --> 11:05.731
Right!

11:05.732 --> 11:08.525
See, even though I make all the decisions,
whenever I see Turk is getting upset,

11:08.526 --> 11:13.070
I throw him a little decision that means nothing
to me. Like buying a new car as long as

11:13.071 --> 11:15.425
it's got four wheels and
air conditioning, I'm hap...

11:15.426 --> 11:16.686
...py.

11:16.687 --> 11:19.589
Check it, baby! Scooters!

11:19.590 --> 11:21.517
Hehhh.

11:21.518 --> 11:22.527
Fantastic!

11:28.282 --> 11:29.056
He's a drinker!

11:29.057 --> 11:34.686
Clever. Look, J.D., I think this is so unfair.
I mean, I never get to see Turk and Carla anymore.

11:34.687 --> 11:37.581
It's like we got divorced and you get to keep
the friends just because you live with them.

11:40.339 --> 11:42.465
It just feels like you guys are part
of some sort of gang or something.

11:42.466 --> 11:46.936
Elliot, you're overreacting.
We're not some kind of gang, okay?

11:46.937 --> 11:48.440
Okay.

11:49.514 --> 11:51.903
Wolverines, let's roll!

11:59.682 --> 12:01.728
That joyride around the hospital
made me realize two things.

12:01.729 --> 12:07.056
First, it's a bad idea to take a full bladder
out on your hog. Also, I had to draw upon

12:07.057 --> 12:09.538
all my medical experience to
get Mr. Radford out of bed.

12:09.539 --> 12:11.901
Mr. Radford, they're showing
'Cocoon' in the chapel!

12:11.902 --> 12:14.186
I'm not a big Guttenberg fan.

12:14.187 --> 12:17.197
Well, you're the only one, 'cause
people in the hall are going crazy!

12:18.536 --> 12:23.822
Akbar. Akbar. Akbar. Oh, Johnny! Hey!

12:24.871 --> 12:25.930
Run away with me?

12:25.931 --> 12:28.338
I was just looking at
Mr. Radford's chart.

12:28.339 --> 12:32.421
Ahh, I know you're new here, but that's my patient's
chart, and no one touches my patient's chart

12:32.422 --> 12:33.418
except for him.

12:33.419 --> 12:34.857
Yes! I knew he couldn't stay away.

12:34.858 --> 12:38.364
Hi, I'm Molly. And I kinda tagged in here
with the Mr. Radford thing, 'cause I-

12:38.365 --> 12:40.626
Molly, Molly, Molly,
you lost me at "hello. "

12:40.627 --> 12:42.109
Wow, no touchy.

12:42.110 --> 12:48.069
Fair enough. Uhh, Mr. Radford, do I understand you
have pain issues but you don't want physical therapy?

12:48.070 --> 12:50.016
I just don't have it in me.

12:50.017 --> 12:52.985
Here comes the magic. He
always gives me goosebumps.

12:52.986 --> 12:57.721
Okay, then. I sure hope you're comfortable
in that bed, because you're gonna be in one

12:57.722 --> 12:59.749
just like it for the rest
of your natural born life.

13:02.030 --> 13:02.648
What the hell was that?

13:02.649 --> 13:07.943
That... was me talking to a patient who has thrown
in the towel. You can't save everyone, Newbie,

13:07.944 --> 13:11.923
so I suggest you start working with people who
want your help. That's what I will be doing.

13:14.635 --> 13:15.242
Goosebumps?

13:15.243 --> 13:17.714
They're small.
And you can't see them.

13:27.426 --> 13:30.213
Ahh, Mrs. Grodberg,
"jizelbck" is not a word.

13:30.214 --> 13:32.320
I'm still beating you!

13:32.321 --> 13:36.221
Well, I'm just glad your surgery went okay and you
still have your A game. I don't really care who wins!

13:36.222 --> 13:37.556
Half a brain, dammit!

13:38.581 --> 13:39.079
Goodnight, Giselle.

13:40.309 --> 13:40.823
Dr. Cox.

13:42.926 --> 13:44.705
I just want you to know I'm not
ready to give up on Mr. Radford.

13:44.706 --> 13:48.581
Do you want me to give you my "things I don't
care about" speech again? Because, you know,

13:48.582 --> 13:52.442
I've updated it to include all white
guys who add -izzle to anything.

13:52.443 --> 13:54.850
I agrizzle, my nizzle.

13:54.851 --> 14:00.414
Go on home and get in bed, will ya. I'm betting your
friend Mr. Radford's already in his. I'll see ya.

14:13.887 --> 14:15.570
Well, sweetheart, you're here early.

14:16.784 --> 14:19.215
Yeah, well, you know I didn't have any
plans last night, so I went to bed at 8

14:19.216 --> 14:23.115
and then I woke up at 4. And then I realized that
the sunrise just looks beautiful through the trees,

14:23.116 --> 14:27.875
and that my neighbor gets his paper in the
nude... and that he needs to lose like 900 pounds.

14:27.876 --> 14:32.952
In the future, the appropriate response is, "Yes,
I am here early": it's called 'small talk',

14:32.953 --> 14:35.745
not 'my depressing
life in thirty seconds'.

14:38.474 --> 14:42.904
I am not, depressed, sir. In fact,
nothing is gonna get me down today!

14:44.483 --> 14:53.858
"All by myself. Don't
wanna be all by my-"

14:53.859 --> 14:54.913
Oh, shut up!

14:54.914 --> 14:57.618
Did you just tell my patient to shut
up? 'Cause that seems not very doctory.

14:59.321 --> 15:02.362
No. I mean, I said it like all those high
school girls do in the mall, like, "Oh, shut up!"

15:05.230 --> 15:05.889
I should go.

15:07.610 --> 15:08.477
Kick it, Mr. Blass.

15:28.323 --> 15:32.437
Woohoo! Ring around the
Janitor! Pocket full of-

15:32.438 --> 15:33.517
You're funny. Pocket full of what?

15:33.518 --> 15:34.609
...Zanitor.

15:34.610 --> 15:35.714
Not a word!

15:40.944 --> 15:41.592
Why the giant X?

15:41.593 --> 15:42.751
Why the stupid face?

15:43.613 --> 15:44.072
Touché.

15:44.073 --> 15:45.919
You know, I know you
knocked that exit sign down.

15:46.965 --> 15:50.907
Well then I'm sure I can expect an appropriate
retaliatory response. Maybe you could shoot me in the neck.

15:50.908 --> 15:55.885
Sounds like fun, but no. Our game is over,
buddy. Your residency's coming to a close and...

15:55.886 --> 15:58.424
that's it, nothing left to do but...

16:01.024 --> 16:03.674
What can I say, it's been... horrifying.

16:03.675 --> 16:04.685
Thank you!

16:05.764 --> 16:08.468
Well, this is kinda cool! Hey, you
know, maybe we could, like, be friends.

16:08.469 --> 16:09.725
You like huntin' squirrels?

16:09.726 --> 16:11.152
I'd never tried it.

16:11.153 --> 16:14.557
Easiest thing in the world - all you
need are some walnuts... and a boxing glove!

16:14.558 --> 16:16.701
And the day just got better from there.

16:21.688 --> 16:24.931
Mostly because Mr. Radford had the same
"screw you, Dr. Cox" attitude that I had.

16:24.932 --> 16:27.149
Good stuff, Mr. Radford!
I'm proud of you!

16:27.150 --> 16:28.575
I hate you!

16:28.576 --> 16:34.278
Excuse me, doctor. I dropped a nickel in that
therapy whirlpool. You think you could get it for me?

16:34.279 --> 16:39.528
Okay, but stand back. These
things can be pretty dangerous!

16:39.529 --> 16:42.543
Whoa. Oh, boy. Whooooaaaa! Agghhh!

16:55.000 --> 16:57.372
So, what, are they shooting some sort of
Geeks of Sacred Heart calendar out here?

16:58.885 --> 17:02.259
Actually, no, I almost drowned diving for a
nickel; but I'm sure you're more interested

17:02.260 --> 17:07.167
in conspiracy theories about gangs
and friend stealing. Peace out.

17:12.823 --> 17:19.588
Hey! Why did you kick'a my scooter?
Why? All you Americans are bullies!

17:20.853 --> 17:22.583
That is why the whole world hates you!

17:22.584 --> 17:26.768
Easy, Massimo. It's okay, she's gonna fix it,
just go inside and I'll meet you in my office.

17:30.130 --> 17:31.278
He's not even Italian.

17:32.653 --> 17:35.240
I'm sorry. Look, um...
You wouldn't understand.

17:35.241 --> 17:39.870
No, I get it. I mean, you're feeling lonely,
you're feeling rejected. I mean, most people

17:39.871 --> 17:43.055
around here won't talk to me, and
even Johnny won't take my help.

17:43.056 --> 17:44.535
Who's Johnny?

17:44.536 --> 17:48.398
You know, he's a resident, he's got like gelled-up
hair, and he and his friends are in a motorcycle gang?

17:48.399 --> 17:49.777
I knew it!

17:50.862 --> 17:54.357
You know what, Elliot, you act like everyone's boxing you
out, but you wouldn't even get a cup of coffee with me.

17:56.486 --> 17:57.832
Peace out, baby.

17:59.083 --> 18:00.212
Why is everybody saying that?

18:04.344 --> 18:07.054
Great news, baby. I just picked your
grandparents up from the airport!

18:09.777 --> 18:11.725
Hang on, Nana! Hang on, Grampa!

18:13.306 --> 18:16.441
Not only did I get them home,
I lost six pounds! Ha ha!

18:16.442 --> 18:17.820
Gimme those stupid keys!

18:17.821 --> 18:18.809
Mm-mm.

18:18.810 --> 18:19.739
OH!

18:22.320 --> 18:26.517
That's what I think of your scooters! No
more bugs in my teeth! No more helmet head!

18:26.518 --> 18:31.325
No more making deals with God every time a truck
passes me on the freeway, okay? It's over! That's it!

18:34.398 --> 18:35.346
What the hell just happened?

18:36.460 --> 18:37.623
You got married, Turkleton.

18:40.915 --> 18:43.587
That, my friends, is Mr.
Radford getting out of bed.

18:45.908 --> 18:49.072
And that's Mr. Radford falling back into bed.
But still, enough to rub it in Dr. Cox's face.

18:50.154 --> 18:53.163
That is so great! But I wouldn't do that
unless you want him to rub your face in it.

18:53.164 --> 18:56.649
Did you not see what just happened, or do
you not get face rubbing? Because it's more

18:56.650 --> 18:58.693
than just a bizarro way
to memorize people's names.

18:58.694 --> 19:02.876
Johnny, I mean what Dr. Cox did was
classic reverse psychology. And so is this:

19:02.877 --> 19:07.538
Behavioral modification can sometimes be
brought about through classic conditioning.

19:07.539 --> 19:12.272
Reverse psychology? Nothing? 'Cause that
really kills at the psychiatric conferences.

19:12.273 --> 19:13.561
I must go to one of those.

19:14.600 --> 19:17.421
Look, isn't it possible that Dr. Cox
tricked you as a motivational ploy?

19:17.422 --> 19:19.191
Hmm, no.

19:19.192 --> 19:22.364
After he said there was no hope with
Mr. Radford, didn't you both work harder?

19:22.365 --> 19:24.619
Nnoo! You're like a crazy person!

19:24.620 --> 19:30.021
Look, I'll tell you something else. I mean,
Dr. Cox is a text-book closed-off alpha male.

19:30.022 --> 19:33.150
I mean, you can try forever, but you're
never gonna get that hug that you really want.

19:33.151 --> 19:36.396
Uh, excuse me, I'm not
a child. I'm a doctor.

19:36.397 --> 19:38.304
And I'll get that hug!

19:40.704 --> 19:41.560
Hey! Watch it!

19:41.561 --> 19:45.173
Oh! Hot! Ah! Ahh!

19:45.174 --> 19:47.318
I, um... brought you coffee.

19:47.319 --> 19:51.150
Oh, it's burning, it's like fire! Ah!

19:54.704 --> 19:56.116
Baby, I know you don't
wanna return the scooters.

19:58.011 --> 20:00.975
Can't this wait till after my scooter
club's fall foliage trip through Maine?

20:00.976 --> 20:02.067
No, Turk!

20:02.068 --> 20:03.374
Meeeeaaaan!

20:03.375 --> 20:09.067
Look! You're a husband now. When you make decisions,
you're supposed to think about what we need,

20:09.068 --> 20:10.554
not what you want!

20:10.555 --> 20:15.385
Well, it doesn't seem like you're doing that!
You gave away my clock! And you sold my chairs.

20:15.386 --> 20:17.463
And what the hell is up with
these ridiculously tiny bowls!?

20:17.464 --> 20:19.696
They're sake cups, Jethro!

20:19.697 --> 20:22.038
I knew that...

20:22.039 --> 20:25.002
Everything I do, Turk, I do it for us!

20:26.223 --> 20:28.292
Oh, yeah? Then why does
Rowdy smell like daisies?

20:29.381 --> 20:31.142
'Cause I had him filled with potpourri.

20:35.456 --> 20:36.452
You can keep the scooters.

20:37.828 --> 20:39.142
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.

20:40.498 --> 20:41.287
Marriage is gonna be tricky.

20:41.288 --> 20:42.316
Yeah.

20:45.878 --> 20:46.537
Thanks.

20:51.536 --> 20:52.221
How are your thighs?

20:52.222 --> 20:54.350
They're very hot and pink.

20:55.701 --> 20:56.994
Do you want me to rub ointment on them?

21:01.018 --> 21:01.999
It's okay.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.128
Awwwwwwww.

21:06.583 --> 21:07.263
Weird.

21:12.535 --> 21:13.754
Ka-pow!

21:13.755 --> 21:17.641
Look at that. I knew I smelled that
odd combination of fear and baby powder.

21:18.877 --> 21:20.085
How does he know about my belly rash?

21:20.086 --> 21:24.163
Look, Dr. Cox, I know you were using
reverse psychology with Mr. Radford.

21:24.164 --> 21:25.757
You do, do you?

21:25.758 --> 21:30.229
Yes. And I figured it out all by myself, without anyone
helping me or explaining it directly in my face or anything.

21:30.230 --> 21:34.425
Well, nubile one, your last
lesson and you didn't even need it.

21:38.059 --> 21:43.732
Three years and it's finally
over. I know what you want, I do.

21:50.059 --> 21:50.747
Come here.

21:50.748 --> 21:54.363
Oh, my God, it's finally happening!
Don't miss a moment! Take it all in!

21:58.919 --> 22:03.810
Good God, Fantasia. You don't actually
think I'm done teaching you, do you?

22:04.469 --> 22:07.682
D'you not understand the only difference between
today and tomorrow is that you wake up tomorrow

22:07.683 --> 22:11.493
and start coming in here and killing people, that no
one can say, "It's no big deal, he's just a resident. "

22:11.494 --> 22:15.596
Instead, what they're damn sure gonna be
wondering is who tried to educate your sorry ass.

22:15.597 --> 22:19.943
And when that finger of blame starts pointing
in my direction, I had damn sure better be

22:19.944 --> 22:23.091
in a coma from the anger stroke I suffered
from the last time you tried to hug me.

22:26.679 --> 22:31.116
Oh, and, uh, don't be
late tomorrow... Doctor.

22:32.692 --> 22:35.864
Whether or not you survive in a hospital is
all about how you handle your relationships.

22:38.240 --> 22:44.315
"All by myself / Don't wanna be... "

22:44.316 --> 22:45.904
Whether it's a brand new one...

22:45.905 --> 22:48.505
"... all by myself!"

22:52.790 --> 22:54.582
...or an old one you need
to figure out all over again.

22:56.452 --> 22:57.602
Oh, my God!

22:59.118 --> 23:01.170
I can't believe you did this!

23:03.063 --> 23:07.381
It's even minier than I
imagined! But what about you?

23:07.382 --> 23:11.114
Ah, baby, don't worry about it,
I got it covered. Check it out.

23:28.999 --> 23:31.713
As for me, it was my relationships
that got me through my residency.

23:43.988 --> 23:45.301
Bull's eye!

23:47.927 --> 23:49.693
We're not done with
our thing yet, are we.

23:49.694 --> 23:52.736
No. For you, it's all just beginning.

23:54.734 --> 23:56.431
The weird thing is, he was right.
