33:46.493 --> 33:50.008
Fresh start. Doesn't sound so bad.

33:51.533 --> 33:52.761
What do you know?

33:52.933 --> 33:54.969
Wolfram and Hart are
planning to extract her.

33:55.133 --> 33:56.122
Already tried.

33:56.293 --> 33:59.888
They'll try again. She might have spent
time with the Powers That Be.

34:00.093 --> 34:02.368
Wolfram and Hart will
consider her valuable.

34:02.573 --> 34:04.848
And I doubt your boy will
be able to stop them.

34:05.453 --> 34:07.364
My...

34:08.253 --> 34:09.971
She's with Connor.

34:11.893 --> 34:13.531
You have that on good authority?

34:15.652 --> 34:17.803
You don't seem too concerned.

34:18.533 --> 34:20.012
Connor's my son.

34:20.213 --> 34:23.250
I'm sure he's taking
excellent care of her.

34:29.853 --> 34:31.252
[GASPS]

34:33.493 --> 34:35.085
Someone's here.

34:47.053 --> 34:48.690
- Do you remember how to fight?
- What?

34:48.893 --> 34:50.770
They're coming for you.
I set traps.

34:50.973 --> 34:53.440
But you'll have to fight.
Do you know how?

34:54.253 --> 34:55.288
One way to find out.

35:36.093 --> 35:37.082
Cordelia!

35:48.813 --> 35:50.849
Aren't you the stud.

35:56.773 --> 35:58.172
CARLO:
Ms. Morgan.

35:58.333 --> 35:59.482
It's done.

35:59.653 --> 36:02.645
Mm. Music to my ears, Carlo.

36:02.853 --> 36:06.004
I'm going home. Tell the boys
it's fourth and 10.

36:07.293 --> 36:09.727
All units punt.

36:09.933 --> 36:12.845
<i>- I repeat, punt.</i>
MAN: Let's go, let's go!

36:18.653 --> 36:21.690
That's right, monkey boys,
don't mess with the Big Dog.

36:22.933 --> 36:24.924
It's better than "sidekick."

36:25.133 --> 36:26.851
Did they hurt you? Are you okay?

36:27.013 --> 36:28.207
Yeah, I'm okay.

36:28.413 --> 36:30.449
I didn't expect so many.

36:30.653 --> 36:33.008
You tried. I appreciate it.

36:33.173 --> 36:35.209
And I really like what you've...

36:35.453 --> 36:37.523
...done with the...

36:37.693 --> 36:40.446
Nice. We should probably
get you back home.

36:41.253 --> 36:44.529
Actually, I'd like to stay here...

36:44.773 --> 36:46.001
...with Connor.

36:48.893 --> 36:51.009
I don't think that's the best idea.

36:51.213 --> 36:53.169
Connor's a great fighter.

36:53.373 --> 36:54.726
I helped train him.

36:54.893 --> 36:57.851
But you need more
than just muscle right now.

36:58.013 --> 37:01.608
You're right. I need someone who
won't lie to me, like you did.

37:02.693 --> 37:05.844
All of you, I know you
were trying to help.

37:06.053 --> 37:08.044
But the truth is
the only way to do that.

37:08.213 --> 37:10.443
And that's what Connor's given to me.

37:28.773 --> 37:30.126
Keep her safe.

38:06.173 --> 38:09.404
If it makes you feel better,
I would have chosen you.

38:09.573 --> 38:12.007
Thanks. But no, it doesn't.

38:12.173 --> 38:15.848
Hey, just remember, man, it's
not really Cordy. Well, not all of her.

38:16.013 --> 38:19.562
Maybe she's right. Maybe we should've
just spilled everything from the start.

38:19.733 --> 38:20.848
Played it all card-up.

38:21.013 --> 38:23.573
You mean demons and monsters
and vamps card-up?

38:23.733 --> 38:24.722
Wouldn't have worked.

38:24.893 --> 38:28.363
She's confused is all.
Give her time, she'll see the truth.

38:28.533 --> 38:30.444
- Who the real champion is.
- Damn straight.

38:30.613 --> 38:34.652
If Team Angel hadn't shown up,
Wolfram and Hart would have...

38:34.813 --> 38:36.929
[CREAKING]

38:53.613 --> 38:55.171
- Oh, my God.
- Lorne?

38:55.933 --> 38:57.764
Is he alive?

38:58.973 --> 39:01.282
What happened? Who did this?

39:01.453 --> 39:03.967
- Wo...
- Wesley? Not again?

39:04.973 --> 39:07.726
- Wolfram and Hart.
- Okay, but why?

39:07.893 --> 39:10.965
- I thought Cordy was their target.
- They must know Lorne read her.

39:11.173 --> 39:13.641
Wait. Are you saying that Connor's
place was a decoy?

39:13.853 --> 39:16.606
We fell for it like rookies.
They weren't after Cordy.

39:16.773 --> 39:18.809
They were after what Lorne
saw when she sang.

39:18.973 --> 39:23.012
- They sucked it out of his head?
- How much? What did they get?

39:24.093 --> 39:27.529
They had a demon. I wouldn't talk.

39:28.413 --> 39:31.291
And the thing burrowed inside...

39:33.453 --> 39:36.286
...and took Cordy out.
ANGEL: Lorne?

39:36.493 --> 39:37.846
How much did they get?

39:40.653 --> 39:41.972
All of it.

39:44.373 --> 39:45.522
They tricked us.

39:45.693 --> 39:47.046
Wolfram and Hart or Wesley?

39:47.213 --> 39:50.649
He showed up with the tip about Junior.
How do we know he's not playing us?

39:50.813 --> 39:51.802
We don't.

39:51.973 --> 39:55.409
But Wolfram and Hart may know more
about Cordy's doom-and-gloom thing...

39:55.573 --> 39:57.006
...than we do.

39:57.973 --> 39:59.645
And that's a problem.

40:00.893 --> 40:02.246
[KNOCKING]

40:08.573 --> 40:11.929
- Oh, a drop-by. That's a surprise.
- Is it?

40:12.653 --> 40:16.282
Well, that it took you so long, yeah.

40:18.133 --> 40:19.930
You played me.

40:20.093 --> 40:21.208
LILAH:
You played yourself.

40:21.373 --> 40:24.649
On the phone. You wanted me
to hear that so I would tell Angel.

40:25.733 --> 40:26.848
Free will.

40:27.013 --> 40:28.128
- Look it up.
- Lilah...

40:28.333 --> 40:30.244
I was just doing my job.

40:30.413 --> 40:33.211
You're the one who decided
to take what you overheard...

40:33.373 --> 40:35.170
...and give it to the good and plentys.

40:35.373 --> 40:37.807
So before you go all righteous fury...

40:38.013 --> 40:40.368
...figure out who you're
really mad at here.

40:54.013 --> 40:56.652
- What was the real plan?
LILAH: Let's just say...

40:56.813 --> 41:01.125
...I could have Lorne's brain in a jar but I
left it in his head since he's your friend.

41:02.253 --> 41:06.246
What's that supposed to do?
Lull me into trusting you again?

41:06.453 --> 41:10.287
If I thought you'd ever trust me,
I would've never played you like that.

41:19.533 --> 41:21.728
It's never simple, is it?
