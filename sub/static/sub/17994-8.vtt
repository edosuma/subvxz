00:43.483 --> 00:47.644
The coast - the frontier
between land and sea

00:50.783 --> 00:54.963
This is the most dynamic
of all the ocean habitats

00:54.964 --> 00:58.092
The challenge here is
to survive change

00:58.093 --> 01:02.254
Extreme change

01:29.408 --> 01:33.579
Cape Douglas, on the most
westerly of the Galapagos islands,

01:33.580 --> 01:37.760
totally unprotected from the massive
rollers of the Pacific Ocean

01:37.761 --> 01:41.922
and one of the roughest
coastlines in the world

02:18.472 --> 02:22.633
The marine iguanas of the Galapagos
are the world's only sea-going lizards

02:32.039 --> 02:36.200
Seaweed is all they eat,
but doing so is a dangerous business

02:39.349 --> 02:42.477
The local crabs have
become specially flattened,

02:42.478 --> 02:45.605
minimising the effect
of the pounding waves

02:45.606 --> 02:49.778
And the iguanas have huge
claws to grip the rocks

02:50.831 --> 02:53.958
This seaweed really is fast food

02:53.959 --> 02:57.087
There are only a few seconds
in which to grab a few mouthfuls

02:57.088 --> 03:01.259
before the next breaker
comes pounding in

03:08.579 --> 03:11.707
Female iguanas feed
only on the exposed rocks,

03:11.708 --> 03:15.869
but the males which are larger swim and
dive beneath the surface to reach the weed

03:21.103 --> 03:23.188
They go as deep as ten metres,

03:23.189 --> 03:27.350
for there beyond the destructive reach
of the waves, they find the best fronds

03:29.456 --> 03:32.584
Being cold-blooded they
have to return to land

03:32.585 --> 03:36.746
after about ten minutes or
so to warm up again in the sun

03:53.462 --> 03:57.632
Finding food is not the only
challenge for coastal residents

03:57.633 --> 04:01.814
These rocky shores are hardly
a safe place to lay their eggs

04:01.815 --> 04:04.942
and each year the marine iguanas
have to journey inland

04:04.943 --> 04:09.104
to find a more suitable one

04:11.210 --> 04:15.381
The females lay their eggs in burrows
and leave them there to hatch,

04:15.382 --> 04:19.541
and to do that they
need nice soft sand

04:29.991 --> 04:34.172
Down at the water edge, it was easy
to escape danger in rocky crevices,

04:34.173 --> 04:38.334
but up here the females
are dangerously exposed

04:40.430 --> 04:44.601
A Galapagos hawk

05:13.841 --> 05:18.002
The lizards don't give up
without a struggle

05:37.847 --> 05:42.008
These hawks stay on the coast all year
But they are exceptional

05:43.061 --> 05:47.242
The majority of the birds
that frequent this frontier

05:47.243 --> 05:51.413
spend most of their time elsewhere
- in or above the open ocean

05:51.414 --> 05:55.575
However all seabirds have to come
to land in order to lay their eggs

05:56.638 --> 06:00.809
And after spending many lonely
months searching the ocean for food,

06:00.810 --> 06:04.970
they have to re-establish
their social relationships

06:07.077 --> 06:11.238
Frigate birds display and
exchange nesting material

06:15.419 --> 06:19.591
Waved albatross dance

06:30.039 --> 06:34.200
The need to lay their egg on firm ground
ties the albatross to the coast

06:36.296 --> 06:38.391
but parental responsibilities
are shared

06:38.392 --> 06:42.553
While one looks after the egg,
...the other can go off to feed

07:11.794 --> 07:15.964
The need to breed brings
many different animals

07:15.965 --> 07:19.103
to the coast each year
for a few weeks

07:19.104 --> 07:23.274
Male sea turtles spend all
their lives at sea, but the females,

07:23.275 --> 07:27.436
like birds, must come to
land to lay their eggs

07:33.713 --> 07:37.874
To do that green turtles that live
and feed off the coast of Brazil

07:38.927 --> 07:43.099
swim fifteen hundred miles to the
tiny island of Ascension

07:44.152 --> 07:48.313
that lies bang in the middle
of the Atlantic Ocean

07:58.762 --> 08:02.942
Exactly how they manage to
navigate with such accuracy

08:02.943 --> 08:07.104
and find this tiny lump of rock,
just seven miles wide is a mystery

08:11.296 --> 08:15.457
But each year up to five thousand
turtles manage to do so and then,

08:16.510 --> 08:19.638
close to the coast of Ascension,
they mate

08:19.639 --> 08:23.810
Travelling to and from Ascension and
nesting here can take up to six months

08:25.906 --> 08:30.067
and throughout that entire time,
none of them feed at all

08:33.216 --> 08:36.342
After mating a female has to
leave her natural element

08:36.344 --> 08:40.515
and haul herself up onto land

08:40.515 --> 08:43.654
She does so at night,
laying about three or four times

08:43.655 --> 08:46.782
at around fifteen day intervals

08:46.783 --> 08:50.953
After that she then swims all the way
back to the seas off Brazil

08:50.954 --> 08:55.135
She returns to this very same
island throughout her life

08:55.136 --> 08:59.297
Remarkably, all the world's sea turtles
return year after year

09:00.350 --> 09:04.521
to just a few traditional
breeding sites

09:05.574 --> 09:09.735
Crab Island, in Australia,
is one of them

09:10.788 --> 09:13.926
This tiny two-mile long crescent of sand,

09:13.927 --> 09:17.055
lying a few miles off
Queensland's northerly tip,

09:17.056 --> 09:21.226
provides nesting sites
for half the entire population

09:21.227 --> 09:25.408
of one of the world's
rarest sea turtles

09:25.409 --> 09:28.536
Flat-backed turtles are large,
over a metre long

09:28.537 --> 09:30.622
- but they have to be careful

09:30.623 --> 09:33.750
There are other giant
reptiles here too

09:33.751 --> 09:37.922
Salt-water crocodiles

09:41.061 --> 09:43.146
Every night throughout the year

09:43.147 --> 09:47.318
there are flat-backs burying their eggs
all along this lonely stretch of sand

10:01.938 --> 10:06.099
Nine weeks later and things
are about to happen

10:13.419 --> 10:17.591
These eyes shining in the darkness
belong to night herons

10:23.858 --> 10:28.029
As if from nowhere, hundreds of birds
suddenly appear on the sand dunes

10:29.082 --> 10:33.253
Pelicans wait patiently

10:33.254 --> 10:37.414
Jabiru storks pace up and down

10:40.564 --> 10:44.725
Before long they see what
they've been waiting for.

11:08.751 --> 11:11.878
Because these turtles lay
their eggs throughout the year,

11:11.879 --> 11:16.040
the hatchlings emerge night after night
in a steady trickle of beak sized meals

11:39.013 --> 11:43.194
Pelican's broad beaks allow
them to dig out the hatchlings

11:43.195 --> 11:47.356
before the herons can spear
them on the surface

11:51.548 --> 11:53.632
The surf may be hundreds of metres away

11:53.633 --> 11:57.794
and at least a third of the tiny turtles
do not survive the journey

11:59.890 --> 12:04.061
And its not just the birds
that take them

12:07.200 --> 12:11.381
Crocodiles, sharks and hungry fish
are all waiting in the shallows

12:11.382 --> 12:15.543
In fact only one in every hundred
hatchlings will survive to adulthood

12:25.992 --> 12:30.152
Another beach, another continent,
and a very special night

12:31.206 --> 12:35.377
Here in Costa Rica there is a turtle which
has found a way of reducing these dangers

12:37.473 --> 12:40.600
When Ridley's turtles arrive
to lay their eggs

12:40.601 --> 12:44.773
they don't come in tens or hundreds...
but in thousands

12:46.869 --> 12:51.030
Over the next six days around four hundred
thousand females will visit this beach

12:54.179 --> 12:58.340
At the peak time, five thousand
are coming and going each hour

12:59.393 --> 13:03.573
The beach gets so crowded that
they have to clamber over one another

13:03.574 --> 13:07.735
to find a bare patch of sand
where they can dig a nest hole

13:10.874 --> 13:14.012
Forty million eggs are laid
in these few days

13:14.013 --> 13:17.140
So these turtles ensure
that six weeks later

13:17.141 --> 13:21.302
when their hatchlings emerge
it's not just a trickle

13:22.355 --> 13:26.527
It's a flood

13:34.890 --> 13:39.051
On some nights, over two million
hatchlings race down to the sea together

13:50.543 --> 13:52.627
With so many appearing simultaneously,

13:52.628 --> 13:56.799
the predators are overwhelmed and most
of the young turtles reach the sea safely

14:12.462 --> 14:16.643
Leaving the sea and emerging onto
land is hard enough for turtles

14:16.644 --> 14:20.805
It'd even harder for fish

14:27.083 --> 14:31.253
Each year for hundreds of miles
along the Newfoundland coast,

14:31.254 --> 14:35.415
capelin throw themselves
onto the beaches

15:02.569 --> 15:06.730
At least a million tonnes of
fish floundering out of the water

15:07.783 --> 15:11.955
- a real gift for scavenging
eagles and gulls

15:31.799 --> 15:34.927
Odd though it may seem for a fish,
these capelin,

15:34.928 --> 15:39.089
like the turtles, have also
come out of the sea to breed

15:51.633 --> 15:54.761
The males are trying to
fertilise the eggs

15:54.762 --> 15:58.932
that the females are
depositing in the sand

15:58.933 --> 15:59.975
Like the Ridley's turtles,

15:59.976 --> 16:04.147
they have synchronised their mass
laying with the tide

16:05.200 --> 16:08.328
In a few days it will be over

16:08.329 --> 16:12.500
Most of the capelin die but only after
they've left their eggs in the sand

16:16.682 --> 16:18.766
Other capelin populations
lay their eggs

16:18.767 --> 16:22.939
in the ocean so why do the
Newfoundland fish spawn on land

16:23.992 --> 16:27.119
It seems that eggs deposited in
the beach may be safer

16:27.120 --> 16:31.281
from predators and develop faster
than in colder waters out to sea

16:35.473 --> 16:38.601
But wherever they do so,
the huge spawning shoals

16:38.602 --> 16:42.762
provide the concentration of food that
seabirds need when they assemble to breed

16:47.997 --> 16:52.168
Ninety five percent of the
world's seabirds nest together,

16:52.169 --> 16:56.340
mostly in large spectacular colonies

16:58.436 --> 17:02.597
This is Funk Island forty miles
off the coast of Newfoundland

17:03.660 --> 17:07.820
- an isolated rock crammed
with breeding sea-birds

17:16.184 --> 17:20.345
This was the last breeding ground for the
flightless Great Auk, sadly now extinct

17:22.441 --> 17:26.622
Today it's still the world's
largest Guillemot colony

17:26.623 --> 17:30.784
Over a million of them share the
crowded island with 250,000 gannets

17:34.976 --> 17:37.060
It's not the lack of suitable sites

17:37.061 --> 17:41.232
that causes the seabirds
to breed in such densities

17:41.233 --> 17:44.360
Here in the North Atlantic,
there's a wide choice of

17:44.361 --> 17:47.499
empty coastline that
the birds could use

17:47.500 --> 17:50.627
The key factor limiting the size
and location of seabird colonies

17:50.628 --> 17:54.789
seems to be the availability of food
in the surrounding ocean

18:01.067 --> 18:05.228
There are lots of hungry mouths to feed
and a constant demand for fish

18:12.548 --> 18:15.676
Throughout the long summer days
at colonies like funk,

18:15.677 --> 18:19.848
There's a continual stream of birds,
heading out to the ocean to find food

18:20.901 --> 18:25.062
and returning with full crops
to feed their young

18:33.425 --> 18:36.553
Gannets will travel up
to two hundred miles

18:36.554 --> 18:39.691
from the colony on
a single foraging trip

18:39.692 --> 18:42.820
They are not fussy eaters
and will take everything

18:42.821 --> 18:46.982
- from tiny sand eels to herring

18:59.527 --> 19:01.611
Puffins, on the other hand,
are very particular about

19:01.612 --> 19:05.783
what they eat and because they can
only fly short distances,

19:05.784 --> 19:09.955
they only nest where there's a good
supply of suitable food close by

19:17.265 --> 19:21.436
One such place is the sea of Okhotsk
in far eastern Russia

19:24.575 --> 19:28.736
This is the island of Talan

19:30.842 --> 19:35.012
Throughout the long arctic winter,
it is encircled by ice

19:35.013 --> 19:38.141
But as spring approaches,
that begins to break up

19:38.142 --> 19:41.280
and seabirds that have spent
the winter feeding out

19:41.281 --> 19:45.442
on the open ocean far to
the south begin to return

19:50.676 --> 19:54.837
Its isolated position and steep cliffs
make Talan a perfect nesting site

19:59.019 --> 20:01.114
The Tufted Puffins arrive first

20:01.115 --> 20:05.276
These are the Pacific cousins of
our less spectacular Atlantic species

20:10.500 --> 20:14.681
Horned puffins soon follow

20:14.682 --> 20:18.852
In all, fourteen different species
return to Talan each spring

20:18.853 --> 20:23.034
and in just a few weeks
the once silent cliffs

20:23.035 --> 20:27.196
come alive to the calls of
4 million breeding seabirds

20:31.377 --> 20:35.548
This is a multi-storey avian city

20:43.912 --> 20:48.073
Assembling in these dense colonies after
having spent a largely solitary life

20:49.126 --> 20:52.253
at sea provides the birds with
the social stimulation

20:52.254 --> 20:56.426
that is the key to co-ordinating
their breeding

20:58.522 --> 21:01.649
By nesting and laying together
they ensure that

21:01.650 --> 21:05.831
most of their chicks will leave
the nest at exactly the same time

21:05.832 --> 21:09.992
Just like the turtles this is the way
they spread the impact of predators

21:14.185 --> 21:18.355
The world's largest eagle
- Steller's sea eagle

21:18.356 --> 21:22.517
A third as big again as a golden

21:24.623 --> 21:28.784
Throughout the summer, the eagles
hunt in Talan's crowded colonies

21:41.318 --> 21:45.499
Riding on the updrafts,
they patrol the top of the cliffs,

21:45.500 --> 21:49.661
Iooking out for any Kittiwake
that ventures too far from the rock face

21:55.939 --> 22:00.099
Suddenly the huge eagle stoops
with the aerial agility of a falcon

22:09.506 --> 22:13.666
Co-ordinated panic among the kittiwakes
confuses their attacker

22:29.340 --> 22:33.501
But the eagle doesn't give up

22:43.949 --> 22:48.110
And it has got one

23:00.655 --> 23:04.816
Another kind of seabird on Talan
has a particularly effective way

23:05.869 --> 23:07.954
of defending itself against predators

23:07.955 --> 23:12.126
- but it doesn't appear until
an hour before sunset

23:16.308 --> 23:20.479
As if from nowhere, dense swarms of
seabirds suddenly arrive off-shore

23:26.746 --> 23:30.918
They're spent the day feeding far away,
where the sea ice has already broken up

23:33.014 --> 23:37.184
They are crested auklets,
hardly bigger than starlings

23:37.185 --> 23:41.356
A million of them return to Talan each
year to nest in its fields of boulders

23:49.709 --> 23:52.847
For an hour before sunset,
the hillsides comes alive

23:52.848 --> 23:57.018
with huge flocks of circling auklets
They're nervous

23:57.019 --> 24:01.180
No one wants to be the first to land

24:07.458 --> 24:10.585
Auklets are very social when
they are back together at the coast

24:10.586 --> 24:13.724
One of the advantages of nesting
in such densities

24:13.725 --> 24:17.895
may be the chance to share
information on good feeding sites

24:17.896 --> 24:22.057
It also gives them the
opportunity to court

24:26.249 --> 24:30.410
But perhaps most importantly,
there is safety in numbers

24:36.687 --> 24:40.848
Ravens and peregrines circle above
the scree slope every evening

24:57.565 --> 25:01.725
By taking off together,
the auklets hope to confuse the predators

25:34.094 --> 25:38.265
Eventually their persistence
pays off

25:47.671 --> 25:50.799
The birds that face the
greatest challenge in coming

25:50.800 --> 25:54.961
to the coast to nest are
surely the penguins

26:07.506 --> 26:11.666
Unable to fly, they have no alternative
but to brave the immense waves

26:25.244 --> 26:27.339
Most penguins live in the southern ocean

26:27.340 --> 26:31.501
and they have to accept being
hurled about by the surf

26:50.303 --> 26:54.463
Whatever the weather, the penguin parents
have to come back to feed their chicks

27:05.955 --> 27:08.040
A southern sea lion bull

27:08.041 --> 27:12.212
- he knows the penguins always use
the same traditional landing beach

27:17.436 --> 27:19.531
Having braved the thundering surf,

27:19.532 --> 27:23.693
the penguins have to make a mad dash
across open rock to get to their nests

27:46.666 --> 27:50.847
Despite his massive size and
a body adapted for swimming,

27:50.848 --> 27:55.009
the bull chases the penguins for forty
or fifty metres across the rocks

28:50.340 --> 28:54.511
Having caught his penguin, the sea lion
carries it out into deeper water where,

28:55.565 --> 28:59.725
by violently thrashing the little body,
he skins his meal

29:10.174 --> 29:14.335
The seas around the Falklands are some
of the roughest in the world

29:16.442 --> 29:20.602
In spite of that, the southern ocean
is home to millions of tiny seabirds

29:21.656 --> 29:24.794
hardly bigger than swallows-petrels

29:24.795 --> 29:27.922
Being so small they are very
vulnerable to the bad weather

29:27.923 --> 29:31.050
A severe storm can blow
them miles off course

29:31.051 --> 29:35.232
and keep them away from
their nests for days

29:35.233 --> 29:39.394
But these birds have developed a very
effective solution to that problem

29:42.533 --> 29:45.671
They lay a rather special egg

29:45.672 --> 29:49.832
Most bird's eggs, left exposed for even
a few hours, will chill and never hatch

29:51.928 --> 29:54.013
But these eggs are different

29:54.014 --> 29:57.152
They can be left for several days
without incubation and remain undamaged...

29:57.153 --> 30:01.314
...while the parents struggle
home through the storm

30:05.495 --> 30:09.667
Prions have also come up with
a good way to avoid most predators

30:10.720 --> 30:14.881
They never come back to the
coast until after dark

30:16.987 --> 30:20.115
These are Thin-billed Prions

30:20.116 --> 30:24.286
Their burrows honeycomb this
hillside in the Falklands

30:24.287 --> 30:26.371
It'd deserted throughout
the daylight hours...

30:26.372 --> 30:28.467
...but as soon as it's dark

30:28.468 --> 30:31.596
and difficult for airborne
predators to hunt...

30:31.597 --> 30:35.758
...the prions return

30:40.993 --> 30:45.153
As soon as they land, they call

30:49.345 --> 30:50.387
The problem, of course...

30:50.388 --> 30:54.549
...is finding your burrow
among all the others

30:55.602 --> 30:59.783
He's listening out for
his mate's call...

30:59.784 --> 31:03.945
...and down he goes.

31:09.180 --> 31:11.264
The Alaskan coast

31:11.265 --> 31:15.426
It's spring and the last of
the winter storms is subsiding

31:18.565 --> 31:22.746
The plankton in this sea is in
bloom again and just off shore,

31:22.747 --> 31:26.907
humpback whales have
returned to feed

31:32.142 --> 31:36.303
For these huge animals, there is a real
risk in coming into such shallow water

31:37.356 --> 31:41.528
and each year a good number
of them pay the price

31:46.752 --> 31:49.879
It is an ignominious ending
for an ageing whale

31:49.880 --> 31:54.052
But so much flesh will not go to waste

31:55.105 --> 31:59.266
A black bear emerges
cautiously from the woods

32:08.672 --> 32:12.843
Visitors to the coast that don't come to
breed, have usually come to scavenge

32:14.939 --> 32:18.067
A whole range of different animals
have learnt to exploit

32:18.068 --> 32:20.152
the enormous quantity of food...

32:20.153 --> 32:24.324
.....that washes up everyday on
coastlines around the world

32:25.378 --> 32:29.548
But like so much at the coast
the quantity of flotsam

32:29.549 --> 32:31.634
and jetsam is unpredictable

32:31.635 --> 32:35.806
Nobody can rely on it alone

32:38.945 --> 32:43.105
This carcass even attracted
a shy pack of wolves only too happy

32:44.169 --> 32:45.211
to anoint themselves with the...

32:45.212 --> 32:49.373
...scent of rotting whale

32:52.512 --> 32:54.607
It was months before the
scavengers finally

32:54.608 --> 32:57.735
cleaned up all the meat
on this huge and...

32:57.736 --> 33:01.897
...unpredictable gift from the sea

33:07.132 --> 33:11.293
Whales give birth to their young at sea
and so can spend their entire lives there

33:13.389 --> 33:17.569
Other marine mammals - one of that are
in fact distant cousins of bears

33:17.570 --> 33:21.731
- have to return... each year to
their ancestral home on land

33:28.009 --> 33:32.170
The high arctic
Here lives one of them...the walrus

33:42.619 --> 33:45.756
Walruses spend nearly
all their lives at sea,

33:45.757 --> 33:47.842
but each year for just a few weeks...

33:47.843 --> 33:52.004
...they have to return to the coast.

33:53.057 --> 33:56.195
They seek out isolated beaches
like this one on Round Island in the...

33:56.196 --> 33:59.323
...far northern Pacific

33:59.324 --> 34:03.495
Suitable sites like this,
free from bears, are so scarce...

34:03.496 --> 34:06.633
...that at times as many as
fourteen thousand animals

34:06.634 --> 34:08.719
will cram themselves on to this...

34:08.719 --> 34:12.880
...one beach

34:19.159 --> 34:22.286
When they first emerge from
the sea the walrus are white

34:22.286 --> 34:26.456
That's because being warm-blooded
animals living in very cold ocean,

34:26.458 --> 34:29.596
they conserve heat by...

34:29.597 --> 34:33.766
...keeping their blood concentrated
in the core of their bodies

34:33.768 --> 34:36.896
On land it's warm enough for them
to allow their...

34:36.897 --> 34:41.068
...outer blood vessels to dilate and
that turns their skin from white to pink

34:51.516 --> 34:54.643
Now they can moult the outer
layers of their skin,

34:54.645 --> 34:58.806
rubbing themselves up
against the rocks

35:00.913 --> 35:04.040
But more than anything
else coming to land

35:04.041 --> 35:07.168
brings the walrus relief
from having to spend energy

35:07.169 --> 35:11.341
maintaining their body temperature
in an icy-cold ocean

35:15.522 --> 35:18.650
Heat conservation, in fact, may well
be the primary reason so many...

35:18.651 --> 35:22.822
...sea mammals are forced to
return to the land each year

35:29.089 --> 35:33.260
The world's coldest seas
are in Antarctica

35:34.314 --> 35:37.441
Each spring, half the world's
Southern Elephant seals

35:37.442 --> 35:41.623
return to the island
of South Georgia

35:41.624 --> 35:45.785
Elephant seals have particularly thick
insulation of blubber that keeps them warm

35:46.838 --> 35:50.999
For them breeding is the only
reason to leave the sea

35:57.276 --> 35:59.361
With temperatures down
to minus 20...

35:59.362 --> 36:03.533
...and hundred mile an hour winds,
it can't be comfortable out on the beach,

36:04.586 --> 36:06.671
but heat dissipates more
rapidly through water...

36:06.672 --> 36:10.842
...than through air so even
in these conditions...

36:10.843 --> 36:13.981
...their young which at first
don't have a thick coat

36:13.982 --> 36:18.152
of blubber will be far
warmer on the land

36:18.153 --> 36:22.314
Once the males are established on the
beach the females soon follow

36:27.549 --> 36:31.710
Within just ten days the empty beach
fills up with six thousand elephant seals

36:35.902 --> 36:40.063
Almost immediately the females give
birth to pups sired the previous year

36:51.555 --> 36:55.726
Their milk is very rich and the pups
grow astonishingly quickly

37:04.089 --> 37:08.250
In just three weeks they turn form thin
bags of skin to fat balls of blubber

37:12.432 --> 37:13.473
As soon as they've given birth,

37:13.474 --> 37:16.612
the females become sexually
receptive again...

37:16.613 --> 37:19.741
...and it's now that the
advantages of breeding

37:19.742 --> 37:22.869
in such dense colonies become clear

37:22.870 --> 37:24.965
Females can make their
choice from many males,

37:24.966 --> 37:29.127
while successful males can
have access to lots of females

37:36.447 --> 37:40.618
But to gain that access and
control a harem of females,

37:40.619 --> 37:44.779
the bull must be prepared to fight

38:05.667 --> 38:09.838
The larger the male, the louder the roar
and the more likely he is to win

38:21.330 --> 38:25.491
When males are well matched these bloody
battles will last twenty minutes or more

38:47.421 --> 38:51.592
Eventually, the loser retreats into
a stream already pink with his own blood

39:05.170 --> 39:09.350
These battles certainly help females
select the strongest bulls...

39:09.351 --> 39:13.512
...but they bring great
dangers for the pups.

39:22.918 --> 39:25.003
Each year, in the denser
parts of the colony,

39:25.004 --> 39:29.174
a fifth of the pups are
crushed to death

39:29.175 --> 39:32.313
This is why it may
be better to mate

39:32.314 --> 39:36.475
at the edge of the beach
close to the sea

39:40.667 --> 39:43.794
Less dominant males hide
in the surf

39:43.795 --> 39:46.923
They are waiting to try
and steal an illicit mating...

39:46.924 --> 39:51.084
...with females as
they come and go

39:54.234 --> 39:56.318
This male knows he has been
spotted by the big bull

39:56.319 --> 40:00.480
who claims all the females
on this part of the beach

41:06.260 --> 41:10.421
Breeding in groups can bring advantages
to pups as well as to adults

41:17.742 --> 41:21.903
Along the coast of Patagonia southern sea
lions breed together each year

41:22.956 --> 41:27.136
in groups several hundred strong

41:27.137 --> 41:31.308
For the growing pups these colonies
act rather like a school

41:31.309 --> 41:34.436
The bonds and relationships
developed here on the beach

41:34.437 --> 41:37.575
may be vital for the
rest of their lives

41:37.576 --> 41:41.737
Sea lions are very social animals
and as adults and young forage together,

41:42.790 --> 41:43.832
they probably share...

41:43.833 --> 41:48.004
...information about the location
of good feeding sites

41:50.100 --> 41:54.261
Conditions here could hardly be better
for the growing youngsters

41:55.314 --> 41:59.485
As the tide goes out it leaves behind
a selection of sheltered pools

42:01.581 --> 42:05.742
Perfect places for
learning to swim

42:40.207 --> 42:41.249
At high tide...

42:41.250 --> 42:45.411
...it is easy for the pups to take their
first experimental dips in the surf

43:21.961 --> 43:26.131
A killer whale

43:26.132 --> 43:30.293
These young pups have never seen
anything like it before

43:42.838 --> 43:45.966
The Whales though are
very experienced

43:45.967 --> 43:49.094
Each year this same group turns
up along the coast

43:49.095 --> 43:53.266
at precisely the same time
as the pups are starting to swim

44:03.715 --> 44:05.800
The whales need to surprise the pups,

44:05.801 --> 44:09.962
so they have stopped calling
to one another and keep silent

44:19.368 --> 44:23.539
Speed is everything

44:25.635 --> 44:28.762
The whales do not take pups
that are out of the water,

44:28.763 --> 44:31.891
but sometimes their momentum
drives them right up the beach

44:31.892 --> 44:36.063
and then there's real danger
of getting stuck

46:13.149 --> 46:17.309
The whale has to thrash in this
frenzied way to get off the beach

46:18.373 --> 46:22.543
Most of the pups are taken into deep
water while they're still alive

46:22.544 --> 46:26.705
And there the whales - apparently
- play with them

46:50.731 --> 46:54.902
Often an adult whale is joined
in the game by a youngster

46:54.903 --> 46:59.063
It may be learning how to grab a seal pup
before it risks a drive up the beach

47:09.523 --> 47:12.650
Whatever the reason the seal pup
- still alive

47:12.651 --> 47:16.812
- is tossed back and forth
for over half an hour

47:51.277 --> 47:55.438
Even when the pup is dead, the whales'
sport is not completely over

48:27.806 --> 48:31.967
We can only speculate at the real reasons
behind this extraordinary behaviour

48:46.598 --> 48:50.768
But for the whales, the hunting
season is a short one

48:50.769 --> 48:54.950
Before long the pups learn to
stay well clear of the water

48:54.951 --> 48:58.078
and the whales become less
and less successful

48:58.079 --> 49:02.249
After just two weeks, they move on

49:02.250 --> 49:06.422
The killing season is over

49:15.828 --> 49:17.912
That's how it often happens
along the coast

49:17.913 --> 49:21.041
Things are always changing

49:21.042 --> 49:24.169
They're never the same
for long in this,

49:24.170 --> 49:28.341
the most dynamic of all
the ocean's habitats
