(WOLF SNARLING)

18:30.830 --> 18:31.960
MAN: Look out!

18:32.710 --> 18:34.620
(YELLS)

18:35.540 --> 18:38.620
(MEN YELLING)

18:44.040 --> 18:46.330
(GROWLS)

18:46.330 --> 18:48.670
(MEN GRUNTING AND YELLING)

19:03.790 --> 19:05.580
(ENGINES WHOOSHING)

19:08.620 --> 19:10.580
I got him. I got him!

19:13.120 --> 19:15.500
Melch, Melch!
Turn around. Be productive!

19:19.920 --> 19:21.960
(SQUEALS)

19:21.960 --> 19:25.670
Yes, yes, you perform well
when I pull your strings.

19:31.330 --> 19:32.670
Hang on!

19:36.210 --> 19:39.120
(MEN YELLING)

19:43.540 --> 19:45.330
Oh, no, no, no, no!

19:45.330 --> 19:46.620
(YELLS)

19:46.620 --> 19:48.250
(BARKS)

19:49.330 --> 19:52.000
Hey, Wolffe,
can you believe it?

19:52.000 --> 19:54.080
What?
The wolves!

19:54.080 --> 19:56.790
You got your wolf pack back!
(LAUGHS)

19:56.790 --> 19:59.500
Yeah, they fight
just like the boys.

19:59.500 --> 20:01.420
(SCREAMS)

20:03.380 --> 20:06.250
(CACKLES)
Just like 'em!

20:11.670 --> 20:13.380
(YELLING)

20:13.380 --> 20:16.460
(WOLVES SNARLING)

20:20.620 --> 20:23.250
I'd drop your weapons
if I were you.

20:26.750 --> 20:28.670
(GRUNTING) No.

20:28.670 --> 20:32.210
(PANTING) Don't let it
eat me! Please!

20:32.210 --> 20:33.620
(GRUNTS)

20:33.620 --> 20:36.580
(PANTING)

20:36.580 --> 20:38.080
(WHIMPERING)

20:38.080 --> 20:40.170
Why don't you
do the honors,

20:40.170 --> 20:41.670
governor-to-governor?

20:43.620 --> 20:46.710
Ezra, it would be my pleasure.

20:57.710 --> 20:59.040
You did it.

20:59.040 --> 21:01.710
Somehow,
against all the odds,

21:01.710 --> 21:03.380
you actually did it.

21:03.380 --> 21:05.380
I couldn't have
without you.

21:05.380 --> 21:07.040
All of you.

21:07.040 --> 21:09.420
So true, my young friend.

21:09.420 --> 21:10.710
You're welcome.

21:10.710 --> 21:12.460
So I, uh... (SNIFFS)

21:12.460 --> 21:13.670
I guess the fight is won

21:13.670 --> 21:17.830
and we can all get paid
and go home now?

21:17.830 --> 21:20.670
I wish it was over,
but it's not.

21:20.670 --> 21:22.750
Not until we chase the Empire
from Lothal

21:22.750 --> 21:25.250
and show the galaxy
that for all their power,

21:25.250 --> 21:27.330
they can be defeated.
