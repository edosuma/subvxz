00:03.143 --> 00:05.310
X-ray tech to radiology.

00:05.312 --> 00:07.529
X-ray tech to radiology.

00:10.400 --> 00:11.533
I'm afraid he didn't make it.

00:11.535 --> 00:13.868
Of course.

00:13.870 --> 00:15.737
Anyone I ever get close to...

00:15.739 --> 00:17.822
It might comfort you
to know that he died

00:17.824 --> 00:19.624
in a tremendous amount of pain.

00:19.626 --> 00:21.376
How would that comfort me?

00:21.378 --> 00:22.627
I said it might.

00:22.629 --> 00:25.463
But... he lived a long life,

00:25.465 --> 00:26.998
had 15 grandchildren,

00:27.000 --> 00:30.001
fought bravely with the
all-black brigade in Italy...

00:30.003 --> 00:32.887
Are you talking about
Detective Jay Geils?

00:32.889 --> 00:35.757
No, this is Vernon George Abernathy.

00:35.759 --> 00:37.759
Oh, my god. Have I done it again?

00:37.761 --> 00:39.644
Aren't you his wife, Corrine Abernathy?

00:39.646 --> 00:42.146
No, I'm Detective Angie Tribeca.

00:42.148 --> 00:44.232
Oh.

00:45.685 --> 00:47.018
I wish I could tell you

00:47.020 --> 00:48.403
this was the first
time this has happened.

00:48.405 --> 00:50.572
Geils is fine. He's right over there.

00:50.574 --> 00:52.941
Oh!

00:52.943 --> 00:53.943
What's so funny?

00:53.944 --> 00:55.693
Oh, he told me you were dead.

00:55.695 --> 00:57.912
Ohh. Oh, my god. That's hilarious.

00:57.914 --> 00:58.947
Can you imagine?

00:58.949 --> 01:00.262
Yes.

01:03.531 --> 01:05.545
So, he should stay off it for a while.

01:05.645 --> 01:07.628
Little ice, little heat. He'll be fine.

01:07.754 --> 01:09.036
Welcome back, partner.

01:09.038 --> 01:10.922
Let me buy you a cup of coffee.

01:10.924 --> 01:12.924
Thanks, Doc.

01:12.926 --> 01:16.510
- Yeah. Thanks, Doc.
- Anytime.

01:32.895 --> 01:34.061
He's back!

01:34.063 --> 01:35.396
Ah! Ha ha! Ha! Geils!

01:35.398 --> 01:37.315
Hey! Geils is back! Welcome back!

01:37.317 --> 01:38.983
Hey. Whoo!

01:38.985 --> 01:40.284
How you been? Bring it in. Come here.

01:40.286 --> 01:42.653
Aah! God. What's up with these g...

01:42.655 --> 01:44.372
Ugh! Ohh!

01:46.542 --> 01:47.875
Aah!

01:47.877 --> 01:49.076
How you doin'?

01:49.078 --> 01:50.661
Tanner, Hoffman.

01:50.663 --> 01:52.296
Tribeca, coffees.

01:55.195 --> 01:57.028
O-oh, no, I had the latte.

01:57.030 --> 01:58.344
Oh.

01:59.899 --> 02:01.449
Thank you.

02:01.451 --> 02:02.984
There he is!

02:02.986 --> 02:06.871
The big man, the man with
the plan, Detective All-That!

02:06.873 --> 02:08.038
I forgot his name.

02:08.041 --> 02:09.407
- Geils.
- Geils!

02:09.408 --> 02:10.708
Tanner, Hoffman.

02:10.710 --> 02:12.627
We missed you, buddy. Welcome back.

02:12.629 --> 02:14.796
Oh, and by the way, uh,
Lieutenant wants to see you.

02:14.798 --> 02:16.330
Ugh. What kind of mood's he in today?

02:16.332 --> 02:18.800
Tribeca, get the hell in here!

02:18.802 --> 02:20.835
Pretty good. Hmm.

02:20.837 --> 02:22.503
Yeah, it's possible.

02:23.840 --> 02:25.890
Geils, what the hell
are you doing back here?

02:25.892 --> 02:28.009
I thought the hospital
said it was a bad sprain?

02:28.011 --> 02:30.311
Some sprains are worse
than others, I guess.

02:30.313 --> 02:32.397
Yeah.

02:37.020 --> 02:38.770
You wanted to see us?

02:38.772 --> 02:40.855
Another baker killed himself.

02:40.857 --> 02:41.773
Damn it!

02:41.775 --> 02:43.241
That's the third one this month.

02:43.243 --> 02:45.326
- How old?
- I'm 56.

02:45.328 --> 02:47.111
You look great.

02:47.113 --> 02:48.613
What? This old thing?

02:48.615 --> 02:50.665
I'm thinking you want us
to look into the baker.

02:50.667 --> 02:52.366
No! Leave that to the coroner.

02:52.368 --> 02:54.335
You two just figure out why he's dead.

02:54.337 --> 02:56.254
Geils, you sure that knee's okay?

02:56.256 --> 02:58.923
Ready for action.

03:01.711 --> 03:03.711
I'm really glad we get
to be partners again.

03:03.713 --> 03:05.596
don't get all squishy on me.

03:05.598 --> 03:07.765
Doesn't mean we're gonna
be best friends forever.

03:07.767 --> 03:09.267
I know.

03:10.770 --> 03:13.137
Boy, you don't let anybody in, do you?

03:13.139 --> 03:14.639
I have my reasons.

03:14.641 --> 03:16.140
Which you're not about to tell me.

03:16.142 --> 03:19.143
Let's just say, I was
engaged to my first partner,

03:19.145 --> 03:22.396
and he vanished under
mysterious circumstances.

03:22.398 --> 03:24.398
I was engaged to my first partner,

03:24.400 --> 03:27.235
and he vanished under
mysterious circumstances.

03:27.237 --> 03:28.653
It's okay. I don't want to know.

03:28.655 --> 03:29.987
You just don't let up, do you?

03:29.989 --> 03:32.490
No, I don't want to hear
it. Fine. I'll tell you.

03:32.492 --> 03:35.710
It was meant to be the
happiest day of my life.

03:39.849 --> 03:41.438
Officer Tribeca?

03:41.438 --> 03:42.688
Yes, Sergeant Pepper?

03:42.689 --> 03:44.388
I have some bad news.

03:44.390 --> 03:45.890
You're under arrest...

03:45.892 --> 03:47.224
For stealing my heart.

03:47.226 --> 03:49.643
Aww.

03:49.645 --> 03:53.197
You have the right to remain beautiful.

03:53.199 --> 03:58.119
Anything you say will only make
me fall more in love with you.

03:58.121 --> 04:00.821
What are you doing? Are
you cuffing my finger?

04:00.823 --> 04:03.657
That's a ring. Will you marry me?

04:03.659 --> 04:05.409
Oh, my god. Yes!

04:05.411 --> 04:06.660
I love you so much.

04:06.662 --> 04:07.962
I love you, too.

04:07.964 --> 04:10.631
Are you gonna be
comfortable with swinging?

04:10.633 --> 04:12.666
Of course.

04:28.735 --> 04:30.568
Be advised, Sergeant Pepper!
Please wait for backup!

04:30.570 --> 04:32.603
I'm going in! Wait for backup!
That's an order, Pepper!

04:40.496 --> 04:42.997
I said I'm going in! I'm going in!

04:42.999 --> 04:44.532
I'm going in!

04:44.534 --> 04:47.668
Wait for backup!

04:58.181 --> 05:01.549
Hey, you haven't looked at
the road in a really long time.

05:01.551 --> 05:03.100
Could you maybe look ahead?

05:21.170 --> 05:23.838
Thank you.

05:25.675 --> 05:27.842
What are we looking at, Dr. Scholls?

05:35.151 --> 05:37.351
The deceased's name is Franz Schubert,

05:37.353 --> 05:38.853
and he owned the place.

05:38.855 --> 05:41.355
That makes a dozen of these
baker suicides this year.

05:41.357 --> 05:42.439
So, 13? Mm.

05:42.441 --> 05:44.024
What's Schubert's story?

05:44.026 --> 05:46.160
Any tension at home? Debts?

05:46.162 --> 05:47.862
That's the curious thing.
We checked his books.

05:47.864 --> 05:50.114
He's flush... made $2 million last year.

05:50.116 --> 05:52.082
Who was the last person
to see Schubert alive?

05:52.084 --> 05:55.002
A wedding planner picked up
a wedding cake this morning.

05:55.004 --> 05:57.004
For a wedding, I'm guessing.

05:57.006 --> 05:58.672
Wedding.

05:58.674 --> 06:00.674
Hey, are you all right?

06:00.676 --> 06:02.843
Let's just say,

06:02.845 --> 06:05.546
I get a little twitchy
when it comes to weddings.

06:05.548 --> 06:08.382
I get a little twitchy
when it comes to weddings.

06:08.384 --> 06:09.954
Why don't I interview
the wedding planner?

06:09.979 --> 06:10.684
Would you mind?

06:10.686 --> 06:12.186
Not at all. I love you.

06:12.188 --> 06:13.721
What was that?

06:13.723 --> 06:16.056
I just said I'll interview
the wedding planner.

06:16.058 --> 06:19.226
I want to have babies with you.

06:22.949 --> 06:25.449
Good. You're here. This is all wrong.

06:25.451 --> 06:27.902
Pull up this floor,
change out the chandelier.

06:27.904 --> 06:29.870
And for god's sake,
tear down the drapery.

06:29.872 --> 06:31.488
It looks like an orphanage.

06:31.490 --> 06:33.908
I'll get on it right away.

06:35.235 --> 06:37.068
Wait a minute. I'm a detective.

06:37.070 --> 06:38.570
I have to ask you...

06:38.572 --> 06:40.989
Hey, are you celebrity
wedding planner Jean Naté?

06:40.991 --> 06:42.490
I read about you in the hospital.

06:42.492 --> 06:44.042
I wasn't in the hospital.

06:44.044 --> 06:45.460
I was in the hospital.
It was in a magazine.

06:45.462 --> 06:46.878
The hospital was in a magazine?

06:46.880 --> 06:49.914
Yeah, Ryan Seacrest had
his 40th birthday there.

06:49.916 --> 06:51.082
You picked up a cake

06:51.084 --> 06:52.750
from the Franz Schubert
bakery this morning.

06:52.752 --> 06:54.302
Did you notice anything unusual?

06:54.304 --> 06:56.337
Like that Franz was dead?

06:56.339 --> 06:57.672
The last time I saw Franz,

06:57.674 --> 06:59.891
he was in perfect
health and high spirits.

06:59.893 --> 07:02.727
I have no idea why he put
an icing bag in his mouth.

07:02.729 --> 07:05.346
How do you know he did
it with an icing bag?

07:06.600 --> 07:09.434
I'm sorry, Detective.
I have to take this.

07:16.993 --> 07:18.409
It's the baker.

07:21.031 --> 07:21.996
He's almost done.

07:21.998 --> 07:24.866
So, what did you come up with?

07:24.868 --> 07:26.451
This was no suicide.

07:26.453 --> 07:28.336
Good afternoon, Dr. Edelweiss.

07:40.433 --> 07:42.300
Ah.

07:42.302 --> 07:43.968
Tribeca, Geils.

07:43.970 --> 07:45.603
No, the icing didn't kill him.

07:45.605 --> 07:47.021
But let's turn him over.

07:47.023 --> 07:48.723
I want to show you
something very interesting.

07:48.725 --> 07:50.975
Now, you see these holes?

07:50.977 --> 07:54.312
I'm thinking someone
fired a gun into them.

07:54.314 --> 07:55.480
Gun holes.

07:55.482 --> 07:57.699
So much for the suicide theory.

07:57.701 --> 07:59.150
I mean, this case is so weird.

07:59.152 --> 08:02.287
It just keeps changing
and changing and changing.

08:02.289 --> 08:03.705
One minute, it's one thing.

08:03.707 --> 08:05.490
And then the next minute,
it's another thing.

08:05.492 --> 08:06.991
God, this cake is so good.

08:06.993 --> 08:09.827
He was such a good baker.
I'm so sad he's dead.

08:09.829 --> 08:11.462
Do you think he's ever
gonna make more cake?

08:11.464 --> 08:13.214
What the hell is wrong with you, Geils?

08:13.216 --> 08:15.333
You're wired.

08:15.335 --> 08:17.335
Freeze!

08:17.337 --> 08:19.921
Nobody move.

08:43.746 --> 08:45.704
Now, if my suspicions are correct...

08:45.804 --> 08:47.420
Oh, unfreeze, everyone.

08:47.422 --> 08:52.175
All we need to do is to
heat this up to 400 degrees.

08:52.177 --> 08:54.477
Here, hold that a moment, would you?

09:01.236 --> 09:03.319
Careful.

09:08.193 --> 09:12.162
Yes, I saw this scheme once
in Belgium but with chocolate.

09:12.164 --> 09:15.165
They reduce the ingredients...
The sugar and the flour...

09:15.167 --> 09:17.333
And, through the heat,
turn it into one piece

09:17.335 --> 09:20.286
of pure, unadulterated...

09:20.288 --> 09:22.956
Oh.

09:27.012 --> 09:28.628
Drugs.

09:32.447 --> 09:34.113
So, the baker was distributing drugs

09:34.115 --> 09:35.698
by baking them into wedding cakes.

09:35.700 --> 09:38.401
But something tells me
he wasn't the mastermind.

09:38.403 --> 09:40.403
Well, wasn't the last
person to see the baker alive

09:40.405 --> 09:42.288
- a wedding planner?
- Yes, Jean Naté.

09:42.290 --> 09:44.490
Geils talked to her.
Think they're connected?

09:44.492 --> 09:46.075
No, they're not connected.

09:46.077 --> 09:47.543
If they were, Ms. Naté
would be lying there.

09:47.545 --> 09:49.161
On the table next to the baker.

09:49.163 --> 09:52.164
No, these are two entirely
separate human beings.

09:52.166 --> 09:53.833
If we figure out where
the drugs are coming from,

09:53.835 --> 09:55.334
maybe that'll lead us to our killer.

09:55.336 --> 09:56.886
Well, we did find something odd

09:56.888 --> 09:58.304
when going through the baker's records.

09:58.306 --> 10:00.423
There was a "Simon &
Garfunkel Greatest Hits"

10:00.425 --> 10:02.975
stuck in the middle of
the hard-rock section

10:02.977 --> 10:05.511
between Led Zeppelin and Night Ranger.

10:05.513 --> 10:08.731
That's a head-scratcher. Maybe
there's a folk-rock angle?

10:08.733 --> 10:10.483
That's what we thought
at first, until we found

10:10.485 --> 10:13.352
this delivery receipt hidden
inside the album cover.

10:14.598 --> 10:18.109
20 pounds of flour for $250,000?

10:18.109 --> 10:19.442
That can't be right.

10:19.445 --> 10:21.528
It's from a place called Tom's Flour.

10:21.530 --> 10:24.414
I think it's time to
pay a visit to this...

10:25.417 --> 10:27.584
Tom.

10:33.959 --> 10:36.343
Looks like they were tipped off.

10:36.345 --> 10:37.377
Excuse me.

10:37.379 --> 10:40.380
Is this Tom's Flour?

10:40.382 --> 10:42.382
It was until yesterday.

10:42.384 --> 10:43.884
Then they suddenly packed up

10:43.886 --> 10:45.886
and shut the whole operation down.

10:45.888 --> 10:48.188
You ever seen this woman?

10:48.190 --> 10:49.306
It's hard to say.

10:49.308 --> 10:50.557
Give it a shot, smart guy.

10:50.559 --> 10:52.943
No, I mean it's hard to say her name.

10:52.945 --> 10:55.479
Jean... No-tay.

10:55.481 --> 10:57.114
She's a wedding planner, right?

10:57.116 --> 11:00.150
Yeah, she used to come by,
check on the flour deliveries.

11:00.152 --> 11:02.986
don't you think it's odd that
a successful wedding planner

11:02.988 --> 11:05.288
would come to check on flour deliveries?

11:05.290 --> 11:06.740
Not really.

11:06.742 --> 11:08.075
I mean, she probably has
a lot of time on her hands,

11:08.077 --> 11:09.993
seeing how nobody's
getting married anymore.

11:09.995 --> 11:12.662
Me and my girlfriend, we've
been together for six years.

11:12.664 --> 11:14.331
She doesn't even care
about getting married.

11:14.333 --> 11:18.418
I get sex, she cooks dinner,
no firm commitment... boo-yah.

11:20.973 --> 11:22.005
What's your deal?

11:22.007 --> 11:23.173
You're disgusting.

11:23.175 --> 11:24.508
I'm a warehouse sweeper.

11:24.510 --> 11:25.592
What were you expecting?

11:25.594 --> 11:27.427
This guy knows nothing.

11:27.429 --> 11:29.846
The capital of Bulgaria is Sofia.

11:29.848 --> 11:31.348
All right, he knows one thing.

11:31.350 --> 11:32.816
Thank you for your time, sir.

11:32.818 --> 11:36.269
If you see anything unusual,
please give us a call.

11:38.209 --> 11:41.044
Sometimes I saw the guys
mix drugs into the flour.

11:41.045 --> 11:43.545
I said call us! Ugh.

11:43.547 --> 11:45.380
Lieutenant, I have a theory.

11:45.382 --> 11:46.715
The wedding business is bad,

11:46.717 --> 11:48.684
so Jean Naté had to
supplement her income.

11:48.686 --> 11:51.233
By distributing drugs
through her wedding cakes.

11:51.333 --> 11:53.367
I mean, think about it...
It's the perfect cover.

11:53.369 --> 11:57.037
What cop is gonna bust up the
happiest day of someone's life?

11:57.040 --> 11:58.206
I'm going in!

12:03.263 --> 12:05.964
Boo-yah!

12:05.966 --> 12:08.383
Tribeca!

12:08.385 --> 12:10.468
Tribeca!

12:10.470 --> 12:12.020
Sorry.

12:12.022 --> 12:15.523
So you need a baker to bake
the drugs into the cakes.

12:15.525 --> 12:18.443
Baker wants out? Boom... one dead baker.

12:18.445 --> 12:20.028
- So bust the wedding planner.
- We can't.

12:20.030 --> 12:21.896
She's not gonna just come out
and say she's a drug dealer.

12:21.898 --> 12:23.281
We have to catch her in the act.

12:23.283 --> 12:24.899
Well, then go undercover
as a bride and groom.

12:24.901 --> 12:27.410
Plan a wedding. Just
don't spend over $5,000.

12:27.488 --> 12:30.123
$5,000 for a wedding in Los Angeles?

12:30.123 --> 12:31.849
Sir, I don't think a
wedding is a good idea...

12:31.874 --> 12:32.840
No, it's a great idea,

12:32.842 --> 12:34.759
but we need a little
money to make it real.

12:34.761 --> 12:36.961
I'm just talking a ballroom, a band,

12:36.963 --> 12:39.764
some chicken, maybe a shave-ice station.

12:39.766 --> 12:42.100
- What the hell is a "shave ice"?
- It's like a snow cone,

12:42.102 --> 12:43.718
but the way they get
the ice is different.

12:43.720 --> 12:46.354
- How different?
- It's more snow than ice.

12:46.356 --> 12:47.972
I'm not getting a mental picture.

12:47.974 --> 12:50.892
Hoffman, Tanner! Get the hell in here!

12:53.363 --> 12:55.113
What do you guys know about shave ice?

12:55.115 --> 12:56.814
It's not crystalline, like a snow cone.

12:56.816 --> 12:59.033
It's smoother in
texture, like ice cream.

12:59.035 --> 13:01.569
No, not like a gelato.

13:01.571 --> 13:03.154
This is not a dairy product.

13:03.156 --> 13:05.540
Sir, I'd like to be
removed from this case.

13:05.542 --> 13:07.542
You know how I feel about wedding stuff

13:07.544 --> 13:08.993
after what happened to my partner.

13:08.995 --> 13:11.212
Tribeca, we all loved Sergeant Pepper.

13:11.214 --> 13:14.082
Remember how everyone around
here used to work too hard?

13:14.084 --> 13:16.467
I think it was 20 years ago today,

13:16.469 --> 13:18.586
Sergeant Pepper taught us how to play,

13:18.588 --> 13:20.254
and we're a better precinct for it.

13:20.256 --> 13:24.058
But he's gone, and
you've got a job to do.

13:25.455 --> 13:26.526
Fine.

13:27.610 --> 13:30.361
No, you're thinking of an Italian ice.

13:31.698 --> 13:33.581
How can I help you?

13:33.583 --> 13:35.916
So, we'd like to get
married as soon as possible.

13:35.918 --> 13:37.702
- We're very much in love.
- Mm.

13:40.247 --> 13:43.198
Don't I recognize you from somewhere?

13:43.200 --> 13:44.866
Hmm.

13:44.868 --> 13:47.502
Never mind. I must be mistaken.

13:47.504 --> 13:49.795
So, when were you thinking
of getting married?

13:49.795 --> 13:51.411
Would tomorrow be too soon?

13:51.413 --> 13:55.215
That might be a little
tight. What about the weekend?

13:55.806 --> 13:58.090
We love weekends.

13:59.510 --> 14:02.260
Excuse me for a minute.

14:02.929 --> 14:05.012
Jean Naté.

14:05.330 --> 14:06.337
Would you please cool it?

14:06.437 --> 14:08.103
You know this is not a real wedding.

14:08.105 --> 14:08.806
I know that.

14:08.906 --> 14:10.288
But if we don't believe
it, she won't believe it.

14:10.290 --> 14:11.740
Now, are you gonna commit
to this wedding or not?

14:11.742 --> 14:13.492
Why don't you commit to kissing my ass?

14:13.494 --> 14:14.576
Oh, that's so crass.

14:14.578 --> 14:16.745
I can't believe I'm
saving myself for you.

14:16.747 --> 14:18.163
Tomorrow?

14:18.165 --> 14:20.248
Well, how much do you need?

14:20.250 --> 14:22.584
Ooh, la la, that's a lot of drug...

14:23.316 --> 14:24.398
Cake.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.317
Drug-cake.

14:27.404 --> 14:29.788
I could probably get that
amount of drug-cake by tomorrow,

14:29.790 --> 14:31.323
but I don't have a wedding tomorrow.

14:31.325 --> 14:33.158
Or do I?

14:33.664 --> 14:35.413
Good news!

14:35.413 --> 14:37.029
We can do it tomorrow.

14:37.031 --> 14:39.498
Tomorrow?

14:44.037 --> 14:45.199
Tomorrow?

14:45.299 --> 14:48.167
That's gonna be great.

14:48.168 --> 14:50.585
Tribeca, are you in or out?

14:54.975 --> 14:57.175
Ow!

15:05.185 --> 15:07.102
The bride won't come out.

15:07.104 --> 15:08.653
Let's just do it without her.

15:08.655 --> 15:10.188
No, she's my partner.

15:11.491 --> 15:13.692
I mean, she'll be my life partner.

15:13.694 --> 15:14.776
I'll talk to her.

15:16.363 --> 15:18.246
Aah! No, no! Not... not yet! Not...

15:18.248 --> 15:19.864
Stop with the music!

15:21.535 --> 15:25.754
I'm not looking. I'm not looking.

15:25.756 --> 15:27.560
Wow. I'm looking.

15:29.259 --> 15:31.960
Oh, my god. You look beautiful.

15:35.549 --> 15:38.049
Hey, hey, hey. Come here.

15:41.355 --> 15:43.165
don't get all squishy on me.

15:43.329 --> 15:48.032
He walked into that tunnel,
and he never came out!

15:48.035 --> 15:50.232
Look, I know this has
been really tough on you,

15:50.232 --> 15:51.481
but how about this?

15:51.483 --> 15:53.566
We put two of the city's best detectives

15:53.568 --> 15:55.568
on the case to find him.

15:55.570 --> 15:57.954
And if they can't, then we will.

16:01.209 --> 16:03.410
You're an idiot. You know that?

16:04.830 --> 16:08.548
Look, this isn't a real
wedding. It's a drug bust.

16:08.550 --> 16:10.550
And if it's a ceremony
solidifying anything,

16:10.552 --> 16:12.250
it's solidifying our partnership.

16:12.450 --> 16:13.833
How's that?

16:15.703 --> 16:17.753
Sounds good to me.

16:17.755 --> 16:19.755
All right, let's do this.

16:19.757 --> 16:21.257
I have such deep feelings for you.

16:21.259 --> 16:22.625
Sorry. What was that?

16:22.627 --> 16:24.377
Nothing.

16:46.584 --> 16:49.385
I think they want us to kiss.

17:02.593 --> 17:04.593
To prove they're a real couple,

17:04.595 --> 17:07.096
the bride and groom will
now do their first dance.

17:07.098 --> 17:11.300
It's traditionally very
well-thought-out and rehearsed.

17:13.020 --> 17:14.136
Thank you.

17:15.606 --> 17:18.390
You think that knee can
handle a little Tango?

17:18.392 --> 17:19.974
You'd better believe it.

17:19.977 --> 17:21.193
Follow my lead.

17:44.502 --> 17:47.169
Aah!

17:47.171 --> 17:49.722
Oh, beautiful, beautiful.

17:49.724 --> 17:51.056
So in love.

17:51.058 --> 17:52.892
If everyone will take their seats,

17:52.894 --> 17:55.644
in a few minutes we'll
have the cake ceremony.

17:55.646 --> 17:59.098
The cake. That's our cue. Are you okay?

17:59.100 --> 18:01.267
Yeah, I'll just put some ice on it.

18:09.860 --> 18:12.027
That's it. I'm going in.

18:12.029 --> 18:13.862
I'm right behind you.

18:13.864 --> 18:15.998
Hold it right there, Naté.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.449
What is this?

18:17.451 --> 18:20.119
You're under arrest for
drug trafficking and murder.

18:20.121 --> 18:21.537
Can I see your badge?

18:21.539 --> 18:24.540
No, you can't, because
I'm wearing dance shorts.

18:24.542 --> 18:27.710
I think she said "badge."

18:27.712 --> 18:28.677
Oh.

18:28.679 --> 18:31.630
Don't worry. I have mine.

18:35.142 --> 18:36.358
Very good.

18:36.360 --> 18:38.693
But I think there's one
thing you weren't counting on.

18:38.695 --> 18:40.478
Limbo!

18:40.480 --> 18:42.063
Ooh!

18:42.065 --> 18:43.815
All right! Ha ha ha!
No, no, no, no. No, no.

18:43.817 --> 18:45.817
Yeah! Whoo! Hoo-hoo!

18:45.819 --> 18:49.571
Whoo! Going down! Okay! Go! Go!

18:49.573 --> 18:52.073
Whoo! Limbo! Limbo!

18:52.075 --> 18:54.626
Ohh!

19:36.920 --> 19:38.587
Smile, you son of a bitch.

19:40.457 --> 19:41.923
Bouquet!

20:00.527 --> 20:02.394
Oh, my god!

20:02.396 --> 20:05.230
It's mine! It's mine! Give it to me!

20:05.232 --> 20:07.399
Ah! I got it! I got it!

20:08.201 --> 20:09.985
I want it!

20:13.740 --> 20:15.240
Aah!

20:15.979 --> 20:17.812
It's the end of the line, Naté.

20:17.814 --> 20:19.653
I've seen a lot of
drug-smuggling operations,

20:20.253 --> 20:22.420
but this one takes the cake.

20:23.340 --> 20:25.506
Think you can cuff her, partner?

20:25.508 --> 20:28.309
I do, partner. I do.

20:28.311 --> 20:29.761
I do, too.
