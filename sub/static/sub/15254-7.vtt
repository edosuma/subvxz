<i>Here are a few things that</i>

00:01.748 --> 00:02.810
<i>you might need to know.</i>

00:02.811 --> 00:04.412
The Omen. A computer
virus that can erase

00:04.446 --> 00:07.115
a hundred zetabytes
of data per second.

00:07.149 --> 00:09.150
It could take down
the Internet, crash airplanes,

00:09.184 --> 00:10.518
and erase every
database in the world.

00:10.552 --> 00:13.988
In truth, Chuck, the virus
is just a piece of the plan.

00:14.006 --> 00:17.792
- What happens now?
- That's the real surprise, isn't it?

00:17.826 --> 00:20.595
There. The Omen is officially
unleashed upon the world.

Christmas cheer?
Try Christmas fear.

00:47.957 --> 00:52.360
A virus dubbed "The Omen" has
infected computers worldwide.

00:52.378 --> 00:55.630
And it has Christmas
shoppers in a panic.

00:55.664 --> 00:57.531
Are their hard drives
in danger of being erased?

00:57.549 --> 01:00.201
Or, is the virus a gag
that does nothing?

01:00.235 --> 01:02.253
Why panic? Ask yourself:

01:02.304 --> 01:04.672
what would baby Jesus do?
- And you are...?

01:04.706 --> 01:07.675
I'm Michael Tucker, assistant
manager of Burbank Buy More.

01:07.710 --> 01:11.346
I want customers to remember
the true meaning of Christmas,

01:11.380 --> 01:13.815
and get back to what you're
supposed to be doing:

01:13.849 --> 01:15.433
buying stuff.

01:15.484 --> 01:17.551
Like this iPad!
A bargain for $599.

01:17.569 --> 01:19.320
Honestly, it's overpriced.

01:19.355 --> 01:20.655
You can get all this
stuff on the Internet.

01:20.689 --> 01:23.908
See, everything is fine
here at the Buy More.

01:23.942 --> 01:24.909
Totally fine!

01:24.943 --> 01:27.362
No computer virus problems here.

01:27.396 --> 01:28.729
Dear God! Jeffrey!

01:28.747 --> 01:30.698
I need your help, buddy.
These people are animals.

01:30.733 --> 01:32.700
The virus is everywhere, and
nobody knows how to stop it!

01:32.735 --> 01:34.702
Nobody knows how to stop it!

01:34.736 --> 01:36.404
What is going on here?

01:36.422 --> 01:40.908
Authorities do not know who
is responsible for the Omen

01:40.943 --> 01:44.762
virus, but assume it is an
act of cyber-terrorism...

01:44.797 --> 01:48.049
Every prison cell in here is
connected to the mainframe.

01:48.083 --> 01:49.984
What if the Omen virus hits us?

01:50.019 --> 01:51.085
You worry too much.

01:51.103 --> 01:53.688
Take another snort
of almond-milk nog.

02:00.796 --> 02:01.796
Do you hear that?

02:19.114 --> 02:21.082
Ellie. Relax.

02:21.116 --> 02:22.417
We are so behind!

02:22.451 --> 02:24.719
We are so crazy behind,
and I can't find it!

02:24.753 --> 02:25.818
Find what?

02:25.843 --> 02:27.021
The star for the top
of the Christmas tree,

02:27.022 --> 02:28.306
the one that Dad gave me.

02:28.340 --> 02:30.658
Deep breaths, Namaste style.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.994
Devon, it's Christmas Eve,

02:33.028 --> 02:34.896
we are having a party
in six hours,

02:34.930 --> 02:37.014
we don't have a tree,
we don't have decorations...

02:37.066 --> 02:39.167
I am Eleanor Woodcomb.

02:39.201 --> 02:40.635
What are you doing?

02:40.669 --> 02:43.237
I am Eleanor Woodcomb.

02:43.272 --> 02:46.074
Saying your name aloud
helps to calm you.

02:46.108 --> 02:49.210
Reminds you you're in control
of your own actions.

02:49.244 --> 02:52.713
I am Eleanor Woodcomb.
I am Eleanor Woodcomb.

02:52.748 --> 02:54.315
Yeah, that didn't work.

02:54.349 --> 02:55.616
Okay.

02:58.787 --> 03:00.021
What are you
freaking out about?

03:00.055 --> 03:03.991
Because Christmas was
my first memory, okay?

03:04.026 --> 03:06.160
The presents, the smell
of fresh-baked cookies,

03:06.195 --> 03:08.496
and I know that Clara is a
little young, but I thought that

03:08.530 --> 03:10.798
maybe it could be her first
memory, too, and I just...

03:10.833 --> 03:13.301
I want everything
to be perfect.

03:13.335 --> 03:16.137
All right.

03:16.171 --> 03:17.838
What's going to turn
that frown upside down?

03:17.856 --> 03:20.224
A real tree, lights,

03:20.275 --> 03:23.511
fake snow, and a picture
of Clara on Santa's lap?

03:23.545 --> 03:25.813
That's a tall order, babe.

03:25.848 --> 03:27.482
I know.

03:27.516 --> 03:31.018
But... that is why I recruited
someone onto our team.

03:31.036 --> 03:33.020
Ellie.

03:33.038 --> 03:34.355
Sarah, I need an update.

03:34.373 --> 03:36.791
It's okay. Project Santa
is under control.

03:36.825 --> 03:38.025
Got the decorations
from your list,

03:38.060 --> 03:39.861
you just need to get
the tree and the snow.

03:39.895 --> 03:40.861
Thanks.

03:40.879 --> 03:42.330
Okay, bye.

03:44.700 --> 03:47.034
Hey, Sarah.
Your sister is in

03:47.069 --> 03:48.402
full-blown Christmas mode.

03:48.437 --> 03:49.737
Well, it wouldn't be Christmas

03:49.771 --> 03:52.206
with the Bartowskis without
a little bit of drama.

03:52.241 --> 03:53.341
Speaking of which...

03:53.375 --> 03:55.176
No progress on the virus?

03:55.210 --> 03:57.211
Whoever's behind this
is a ghost. Untraceable.

03:57.246 --> 03:58.479
No. There is no such thing.

03:58.514 --> 03:59.814
They just haven't
slipped up yet.

03:59.848 --> 04:01.916
And when they do? Carmichael
Industries will be there

04:01.950 --> 04:03.818
to take them down.
But for now, I promise

04:03.852 --> 04:05.253
nobody is going to
ruin our Christmas.

04:05.287 --> 04:07.555
Just everyone else's.

04:07.589 --> 04:09.190
Chuck, it's going to be okay.

04:09.224 --> 04:11.242
Look, I'm going to lock up
Castle and come home.

04:11.276 --> 04:13.094
Oh, by the way, will you

04:13.128 --> 04:16.930
tell Casey, uh... Mr. Pippers,

04:16.964 --> 04:19.666
the Preppy Polar Bear,
has arrived.

04:21.370 --> 04:23.437
Mr. Pippers? Really?

04:23.472 --> 04:26.424
Oh, man, that's like our
favorite childhood toy, right?

04:26.458 --> 04:27.608
One of, yeah.

04:27.643 --> 04:31.012
Top five. Maybe.
But still, our generation.

04:31.046 --> 04:33.681
Not really yours.
I got it on eBay.

04:33.715 --> 04:37.285
Alex's mom said she used to run
around with a little bear thing

04:37.319 --> 04:40.087
like that. It's still in
its original package.

04:40.122 --> 04:43.457
I thought it was
a good idea. Dumb, huh?

04:43.492 --> 04:45.459
No.

04:45.494 --> 04:47.094
It's actually quite touching.

04:48.564 --> 04:49.763
Like you're feeling
real human emotion.

04:49.781 --> 04:51.616
Don't you ever
say that again.

04:51.650 --> 04:53.868
And don't you breathe
a word of this to Alex.

04:53.902 --> 04:56.370
No. No. My lips are...
my lips are sealed.

04:56.405 --> 04:58.272
Christmas presents are sacred
in the Grimes family.

04:58.290 --> 04:59.774
Gentlemen.

04:59.808 --> 05:00.958
General.

05:00.993 --> 05:02.043
We have an emergency.

05:02.077 --> 05:04.579
We know who's behind this.

05:12.621 --> 05:13.788
Merry Christmas, Sarah.

05:16.124 --> 05:17.808
Miss me?

05:17.843 --> 05:19.260
Not for a second.

05:25.517 --> 05:26.651
Ah!

05:29.021 --> 05:31.739
That's no way to treat
an old boyfriend.

05:39.364 --> 05:41.549
Just give up, Walker.

05:41.583 --> 05:42.917
You're no match
for the Intersect.

What are you doing, Shaw?

You're the one behind the Omen?

07:10.997 --> 07:12.164
The plan?

07:14.500 --> 07:16.168
Surprise.

07:16.202 --> 07:17.369
Why?

07:19.672 --> 07:22.040
Why stay in jail
when I can break out,

07:22.075 --> 07:24.776
release the virus...

07:26.346 --> 07:30.115
...and take over the CIA?

07:30.149 --> 07:33.084
Oops. Gave away my plan.

07:37.273 --> 07:38.557
Sarah, thank God!

07:38.591 --> 07:40.993
Shaw broke out of prison,
where are you?

07:41.027 --> 07:42.060
Sarah?

07:42.095 --> 07:43.228
Hello, nerd.

07:44.931 --> 07:46.031
Do me a favor?

07:46.065 --> 07:48.433
Turn on the monitor.

07:54.874 --> 07:56.174
Merry Christmas!

07:56.209 --> 07:57.643
Hey, can I tell you a story?

07:57.677 --> 07:59.611
You untie Sarah right now.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.914
There's this tradition
in Germany

08:01.948 --> 08:04.950
where Santa Claus--
or Krampus, as they call him--

08:04.984 --> 08:06.885
visits all the naughty children

08:06.920 --> 08:08.587
on Christmas Eve.

08:08.621 --> 08:12.291
But instead of giving them coal,

08:12.325 --> 08:16.628
he wakes them up, and the
naughtiest of children

08:16.663 --> 08:18.764
never see Christmas Day.

08:20.466 --> 08:21.600
Let her go.

08:21.634 --> 08:23.135
Or what?

08:23.169 --> 08:25.437
No Sarah, no Intersect...

08:25.471 --> 08:27.572
You're worthless, Chuck.

08:27.607 --> 08:29.141
I've put Castle on lockdown.

08:29.175 --> 08:31.310
Do everything I say.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.977
Or she dies.

08:33.011 --> 08:34.246
Get my drift?

08:34.280 --> 08:37.115
- Why are you doing this?
- Because you put me in jail?

08:37.150 --> 08:39.284
Because of our last fight,
because you tried to kill me?

08:40.687 --> 08:42.087
So much history, Chuck.

08:42.121 --> 08:44.089
It could be anything.

08:44.123 --> 08:45.324
Fine. What do you want?

08:45.358 --> 08:46.491
The CIA base downtown.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.360
Break into
Clyde Decker's office,

08:48.394 --> 08:50.295
retrieve the Macau device,
and bring it to me.

08:50.330 --> 08:51.930
What is it?
What does it look like?

08:51.965 --> 08:54.132
Figure it out.

08:54.167 --> 08:55.767
You have three hours.

08:55.802 --> 08:57.869
Don't you hurt her.

09:00.640 --> 09:01.707
Impressed?

09:01.741 --> 09:04.476
I implicated Chuck
in a massive conspiracy,

09:04.510 --> 09:06.445
and captured his girl.

09:06.479 --> 09:08.346
All from an 8x8 cell.

09:12.318 --> 09:14.286
You...

09:14.320 --> 09:16.054
working with Clyde Decker? How?

09:16.089 --> 09:17.622
Decker was a slug.

09:17.657 --> 09:19.891
He tried to interrogate me,
and in one flash

09:19.926 --> 09:22.160
I knew all his filthy secrets.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.796
A little blackmail, and his
entire team was working for me.

09:25.999 --> 09:27.632
You know what the best part is?

09:30.003 --> 09:32.888
There's nothing that
Chuck can do to stop me.

09:34.907 --> 09:37.376
What now, Chuck?

09:37.410 --> 09:40.979
Chuck?

09:41.014 --> 09:42.981
Oh, boy.

09:43.016 --> 09:44.149
This is bad.

09:44.183 --> 09:45.984
This is really bad.
He is shutting down.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.819
Then we take care
of Shaw ourselves.

09:47.854 --> 09:49.404
Yeah, but he has
the Intersect.

09:49.439 --> 09:51.823
I mean, we're going to need
a plan, a really good plan.

09:51.858 --> 09:53.859
I've got the plan.

09:57.697 --> 10:00.999
Daniel Shaw murdered my father,
and now he has my wife.

10:01.034 --> 10:03.035
He's gonna wish he
never left that prison cell.

10:04.871 --> 10:07.339
That plan's kind of vague.
Morgan,

10:07.373 --> 10:10.008
I need you to reverse-engineer
that virus. Use the nerds.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.276
If they're focused,
they're better than

10:11.310 --> 10:12.611
any computer expert in the CIA.

10:12.645 --> 10:14.780
We need to figure out
exactly what happens

10:14.814 --> 10:15.947
when that virus activates.

10:15.982 --> 10:17.416
I'm on it.
Casey.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.017
Find alternate
routes into Castle.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.353
I need options in case I can't
get the device that Shaw wants.

10:21.387 --> 10:22.354
Whoa, whoa, hold on.

10:22.388 --> 10:23.822
You're going to
break into the CIA?

10:23.856 --> 10:25.724
Decker's office is on
level five. Omega level.

10:25.758 --> 10:28.060
You go in alone, it's suicide.

10:28.094 --> 10:31.096
Who said anything about
going in there alone?

10:32.331 --> 10:34.099
The Macau device was
stolen two months ago

10:34.133 --> 10:35.901
from a Chinese
technology company.

10:35.935 --> 10:37.636
It compresses huge
quantities of data

10:37.670 --> 10:39.538
to fit onto a single
computer hard drive.

10:39.572 --> 10:40.705
Why would Shaw want it?

10:40.740 --> 10:43.241
I have no idea.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.610
What's the best way for me
to get into the CIA?

10:45.645 --> 10:47.112
There's only one way in.

10:48.581 --> 10:50.949
With me.

10:50.983 --> 10:53.552
General, I can't tell you how
happy I am to hear you say that,

10:53.586 --> 10:55.954
but you realize you're putting
yourself on the line here.

10:55.988 --> 10:57.823
This is my team.

10:57.857 --> 11:00.759
And nobody, especially Shaw,
is going to take us down.

11:02.962 --> 11:04.963
<i>I just got off the phone</i>
<i>with Buy More Corporate.</i>

11:04.997 --> 11:06.064
They want to know everything

11:06.099 --> 11:07.666
there is to know
about this Omen virus--

11:07.700 --> 11:09.234
what happens when
it activates.

11:09.268 --> 11:11.169
In order to stop it, we
need to know its next move.

11:12.472 --> 11:14.406
Fold.

11:14.440 --> 11:15.640
I-- no, no.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.576
You guys are the only ones
that understand C++

11:17.610 --> 11:19.010
and a bunch of other
computer languages, okay?

11:19.045 --> 11:20.645
I need you to crack this thing,
I need you

11:20.663 --> 11:21.880
to do it now.

11:21.914 --> 11:23.482
- Yeah. N.I.
- What?

11:23.516 --> 11:25.316
- Not interested.
- Thank you.

11:25.334 --> 11:27.986
It's an immature response,
I know,

11:28.020 --> 11:30.188
but I, too, am
underincentivized.

11:30.223 --> 11:31.723
Until this virus is cracked,

11:31.757 --> 11:33.725
nobody's buying any crap
at the Buy More.

11:33.759 --> 11:35.260
Which means no double overtime

11:35.294 --> 11:36.795
and no Christmas bonus.

11:36.829 --> 11:37.996
True.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.632
But it seems a little
above and beyond

11:40.666 --> 11:42.267
our usual duties.

11:42.301 --> 11:43.268
Name your price.

11:43.302 --> 11:44.569
I got this.

11:45.638 --> 11:48.306
I would like a...

11:48.341 --> 11:51.443
six-inch Classic Italian
BMT from Subway. Boom.

11:51.477 --> 11:53.278
I was going to say
a trip to the Bahamas.

11:53.312 --> 11:55.030
Subway. Done.
I'll make it a footlong.

11:55.064 --> 11:57.649
Nice! Make mine
flatbread, boys!

11:57.683 --> 12:01.119
I'm going into Castle,
in through the ducts.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.821
All right. Hey, be careful.

12:05.858 --> 12:08.326
It's a war zone.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.862
Some scrooge stole Christmas
right out of the Buy More.

12:10.880 --> 12:12.363
Mike, I'm really
sorry to bother you.

12:12.381 --> 12:14.049
Maybe we should
just forget it.

12:14.083 --> 12:15.534
You kidding?

12:15.568 --> 12:17.669
Getting this angel her picture
with Santa might be

12:17.703 --> 12:20.205
the only cheer I get to spread
around here this year.

12:21.224 --> 12:23.108
Let Santa just grab his suit.

12:25.111 --> 12:26.678
Damn hell!

12:27.546 --> 12:29.681
What kind of monster steals

12:29.715 --> 12:33.318
a Santa suit on Christmas Eve,
but leaves the eyebrows?

12:35.021 --> 12:38.273
I am Eleanor Woodcomb.

12:38.324 --> 12:41.326
Babe, don't worry,
I'm calling in the big guns.

12:41.360 --> 12:44.779
Chuck, there's been a
robbery at the Buy More.

12:44.830 --> 12:46.865
Brace yourself:
the Santa suit is gone.

12:46.899 --> 12:48.533
Well, that's terrible.

12:48.567 --> 12:51.620
Sounds like someone could use
a dose of the Christmas spirit.

12:51.671 --> 12:53.505
Just promise me
that you and Sarah

12:53.539 --> 12:55.674
will make it in time
for Christmas dinner.

12:55.708 --> 12:57.742
Ellie really needs
her family around right now.

12:57.777 --> 12:58.944
Yeah, yeah, of course, buddy.

12:58.978 --> 13:01.012
We wouldn't miss it
for the world.

13:01.047 --> 13:04.382
My wife has
been kidnapped,

13:04.416 --> 13:07.085
and I'm officially
ruining Christmas

13:07.119 --> 13:08.453
for the children
of Burbank.

13:11.457 --> 13:13.792
We have a CIA Christmas party
to crash.

13:13.826 --> 13:16.561
Now let's go save our girl.

13:31.403 --> 13:33.838
Why's it getting
so cold in here?

13:35.874 --> 13:37.658
Tapped into
the internal generator,

13:37.693 --> 13:39.026
lowered the temperature.

13:39.077 --> 13:40.511
To stop the mainframe
from overheating.

13:40.546 --> 13:43.748
Once the virus activates,
the resulting data influx

13:43.782 --> 13:45.082
could fry it in seconds.

13:45.117 --> 13:46.117
You with me?

13:47.386 --> 13:49.320
No, you're not.

13:49.354 --> 13:52.790
If you were, you would've
brought a coat, silly.

13:52.824 --> 13:54.458
You're going into
hypothermic shock.

13:54.493 --> 13:56.460
Pretty soon, you'll be
in and out of consciousness

13:56.495 --> 14:00.097
until finally
your heart stops beating.

14:00.132 --> 14:02.383
Why don't you just kill me?

14:04.436 --> 14:06.220
Kill you?

14:06.271 --> 14:09.307
This is about you.

14:09.341 --> 14:11.909
Why do you think I wanted you
in Castle and I sent Chuck

14:11.944 --> 14:13.878
to the CIA?

14:13.912 --> 14:16.047
We both know that
you're the superior spy.

14:17.082 --> 14:18.916
I've missed you.

14:18.951 --> 14:19.851
You're insane.

14:19.885 --> 14:21.018
What we had was special.

14:21.053 --> 14:22.753
I know you felt it.

14:22.788 --> 14:24.589
I'm sure you've laid
in bed at night

14:24.623 --> 14:26.357
thinking about me
beside you.

14:26.375 --> 14:27.525
I'd rather be dead.

14:29.561 --> 14:30.962
Got what I needed.

14:32.097 --> 14:33.831
This is Sarah Walker,

14:33.866 --> 14:36.000
and Daniel Shaw
is in complete control of me.

14:36.034 --> 14:40.221
I don't know what your plan is,
but... it's not going to work.

14:41.773 --> 14:43.541
Shaw's so handsome and smart.

14:43.575 --> 14:45.543
I bet he reads lots of books.

14:45.577 --> 14:47.712
You think you can beat Chuck?

14:47.746 --> 14:49.546
You're not half the man
that he is.

14:49.565 --> 14:52.383
You're not half the man
that he is.

14:54.219 --> 14:55.953
This isn't about Chuck, Sarah.

14:55.988 --> 14:57.855
This really is about you.

14:57.890 --> 15:00.224
See,

15:00.242 --> 15:03.327
I'm finally going to crush
your soul...

15:03.362 --> 15:05.396
the way that you crushed mine.

15:24.416 --> 15:25.766
Mmm.

15:25.801 --> 15:29.453
12 inches of bubbly cheese,
spicy pepperoni and ham.

15:29.488 --> 15:32.490
You really should try
the Fresh Fit option.

15:32.524 --> 15:33.808
No-No offense.

15:33.859 --> 15:34.859
Thank you.

15:34.893 --> 15:36.394
What have we got so far?

15:36.428 --> 15:38.980
All right, so if this virus hits

15:39.031 --> 15:40.648
at the expected
rate and magnitude,

15:40.699 --> 15:42.133
everything electronic
will shut down--

15:42.167 --> 15:43.600
traffic lights, computers.

15:43.619 --> 15:46.621
God, can you imagine a world
without the Internet?

15:46.655 --> 15:48.472
What if it's up to us?

15:48.507 --> 15:52.009
Two Buy More employees
left to stop the Omen virus

15:52.044 --> 15:53.678
and save the world.

15:53.712 --> 15:54.946
Come on.

15:54.980 --> 15:56.681
The government has their
best people working on this.

15:56.715 --> 15:58.215
Right?

16:00.218 --> 16:02.286
♪

16:05.340 --> 16:07.141
God, I hate corporate
Christmas parties.

16:07.175 --> 16:12.129
Everyone turns into sloppy,
embarrassing messes.

16:12.147 --> 16:14.631
Well, hello, Diane.

16:14.650 --> 16:16.801
Oh, Stan, not again.

16:16.835 --> 16:19.353
How about joining me
at the punch bowl?

16:19.404 --> 16:20.871
Enough.

16:20.906 --> 16:21.939
You're embarrassing
yourself, Stan.

16:21.974 --> 16:25.159
Well, if that's gonna be

16:25.193 --> 16:27.278
your attitude.

16:29.665 --> 16:31.332
That is so weird.

16:31.366 --> 16:33.184
Los Angeles spies.

16:34.152 --> 16:35.786
Now focus.

16:35.820 --> 16:38.339
The woman by the giant Subway
sandwich is your target.

16:38.373 --> 16:39.890
Mm-hmm.

16:39.925 --> 16:40.875
Colonel Caroline Hayne.

16:40.926 --> 16:42.043
She's in charge
of internal security

16:42.094 --> 16:44.545
with electronic
access to every room

16:44.596 --> 16:46.630
in this building,
including Decker's office.

16:46.664 --> 16:48.199
So what's our next move?

16:48.233 --> 16:49.734
Seduce her, Bartowski.

16:49.768 --> 16:51.469
Steal her key card.

16:51.503 --> 16:52.836
She's a notorious tight ass,

16:52.854 --> 16:54.472
except for one night
of the year.

16:54.506 --> 16:55.573
Tonight.

16:55.607 --> 16:58.442
Six hot toddies and men
are running for cover.

16:58.477 --> 16:59.877
And you're sure I'm her type?

16:59.911 --> 17:01.812
You're drawing breath
and you're in a Santa suit.

17:04.549 --> 17:06.567
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

17:06.617 --> 17:08.352
Oh! Merry Christmas.

17:11.289 --> 17:13.723
Or Happy Hanukkah.

17:13.759 --> 17:15.041
Whichever is
applicable.

17:15.077 --> 17:16.377
You look like you

17:16.411 --> 17:19.597
want some alone time
with old Saint Nick.

17:19.631 --> 17:21.665
I want to sit on your lap.

17:25.971 --> 17:28.506
Whoo!

17:28.540 --> 17:30.775
I don't think
Mrs. Claus would approve

17:30.809 --> 17:32.743
of any "shenanigans,"
you know.

17:32.778 --> 17:36.430
Well, it's a good thing
Mrs. Claus is a no-show.

17:39.901 --> 17:41.718
Oh, that seems inappropriate!

17:52.464 --> 17:53.581
Oh.

17:53.615 --> 17:55.533
Ooh, yeah!

17:55.567 --> 17:56.867
Naughty Santa.

17:56.901 --> 17:57.968
Uh...

17:58.003 --> 17:59.620
That's just how I like it.

18:02.958 --> 18:04.575
Caroline.

18:04.609 --> 18:06.377
Diane.

18:06.411 --> 18:08.279
Mr. Claus,

18:08.313 --> 18:11.248
I will personally escort you
off the premises.

18:11.283 --> 18:12.933
Oh, what a shame!

18:12.968 --> 18:14.251
Merry Christmas!

18:14.286 --> 18:16.920
Happy Kwanzaa!

18:16.938 --> 18:19.557
Pull yourself together.

18:43.548 --> 18:45.883
Play a little cat and mouse?

18:45.917 --> 18:46.967
Fine.

18:49.004 --> 18:50.805
But I'll find you.

18:50.839 --> 18:53.524
I know you're unarmed.

18:53.558 --> 18:57.144
The armory's been on lockdown.

19:13.845 --> 19:15.980
You can't hide.

19:16.014 --> 19:18.516
I know every secret,

19:18.550 --> 19:22.553
every mission,
every mistake.

19:24.222 --> 19:26.090
Scar on your left hand--

19:26.124 --> 19:28.993
Calgary, 2004.

19:29.027 --> 19:30.794
You never tried
catching throwing stars

19:30.829 --> 19:32.630
after that, did you?

19:32.664 --> 19:35.900
I know everything, Sarah.

19:35.934 --> 19:39.069
I know everything.

19:43.608 --> 19:46.010
You're upset with me.

19:46.044 --> 19:48.045
That's obvious.

19:48.079 --> 19:49.530
But do you really think

19:49.564 --> 19:51.882
I want to spend
the holidays with you?

19:51.917 --> 19:55.186
That I wouldn't rather be
with my family?

19:55.220 --> 19:57.888
It's a trick question, Sarah.

20:00.458 --> 20:02.993
Because you shot my wife
in cold blood.

20:03.027 --> 20:06.197
You brought this all
upon yourself.

20:41.333 --> 20:44.435
Very disappointing, Casey.

20:52.277 --> 20:54.128
We have less than a minute

20:54.179 --> 20:55.930
before a team figures
we've broken in.

20:58.917 --> 21:01.268
Never took Decker
for much of an art collector.

21:09.427 --> 21:11.262
I think I found it.

21:13.097 --> 21:15.783
Colonel Hayne just
accessed Decker's office,

21:15.817 --> 21:17.117
but I'm looking at her.

21:17.152 --> 21:19.637
She's in the bullpen.

21:19.671 --> 21:21.572
We got a code five.

21:21.606 --> 21:24.108
This way,
Colonel Hayne.

21:25.126 --> 21:27.611
Our minute came and went.

21:27.629 --> 21:29.112
What are we gonna do?

21:29.130 --> 21:30.347
There's no place to hide.

21:30.382 --> 21:31.799
Pucker up, Bartowski.

21:31.833 --> 21:33.484
You're about to become a man.

21:33.518 --> 21:34.485
What, like a Bar Mitzvah?

21:34.519 --> 21:35.953
Or something that's a little...

21:35.987 --> 21:37.955
What exactly are you...

21:40.642 --> 21:42.643
Santa!

21:42.677 --> 21:46.030
Retreat immediately or I will
see you court-martialed!

21:57.075 --> 21:59.443
You know, I typically
brush my teeth before I...

21:59.477 --> 22:01.078
We never speak
of this again.

22:01.112 --> 22:02.613
Never... ever...

22:05.000 --> 22:07.685
Shaw, I've got the device.

22:07.719 --> 22:09.053
Chuck, it's me.

22:09.087 --> 22:10.387
Sarah, oh, my God.
You okay?

22:10.422 --> 22:11.588
Yeah.

22:11.623 --> 22:13.357
I escaped Shaw
and I'm hiding in Castle,

22:13.391 --> 22:16.627
...but Shaw's
still down here-- hurry!

22:16.661 --> 22:17.828
I'm on my way.

22:30.056 --> 22:31.173
I know, I know, I know.

22:31.224 --> 22:32.442
It's a madhouse.
It's a madhouse.

22:32.493 --> 22:34.327
Good thing is that Jeff
and Lester made some progress.

22:34.361 --> 22:35.828
How'd your day go?
I got the Macau Device,

22:35.863 --> 22:37.113
and Sarah's hiding out
in Castle.

22:39.232 --> 22:40.533
Sarah. Hey.
Is everything okay?

22:40.567 --> 22:41.801
Casey disarmed Shaw.

22:41.835 --> 22:43.069
He's locked up.

22:43.103 --> 22:45.138
Thank God.
I'll be there soon.

22:45.172 --> 22:46.539
Hurry up, dear.

22:50.210 --> 22:51.744
How'd that go?
Everything all right?

22:51.762 --> 22:53.045
Sarah says that Casey
took down Shaw.

22:53.080 --> 22:55.114
Yes! Nice! Way to go.

22:55.149 --> 22:56.382
She called me "dear."

22:56.416 --> 22:58.134
She never calls me dear.

22:58.185 --> 22:59.619
Shaw's using her somehow.

22:59.653 --> 23:01.086
Oh, crap.

23:01.105 --> 23:03.306
Last time he was in control,
he bought the Buy More.

23:06.527 --> 23:08.144
Morgan, we've got to get
all these people out of here.

23:08.195 --> 23:09.662
I tried, Morgan.

23:09.696 --> 23:11.631
But we haven't made
a single sale all night.

23:11.665 --> 23:12.832
I'm sorry.

23:12.866 --> 23:14.367
Don't be.
Don't be, buddy.

23:14.401 --> 23:15.468
It's okay.

23:17.137 --> 23:19.038
Attention, Buy More shoppers.

23:19.072 --> 23:20.606
Um...

23:20.641 --> 23:22.158
I know
everyone's a little scared

23:22.209 --> 23:24.443
about this
Omen virus...

23:24.478 --> 23:27.613
but, uh, you should not
be waiting in line

23:27.648 --> 23:29.348
on Christmas Eve.

23:29.383 --> 23:31.501
All right?
It's not about the gifts,

23:31.552 --> 23:35.121
it's about spending time with
your friends and your family.

23:35.155 --> 23:39.992
And-and-and-and eggnog and
cheer-- spreading lots of cheer.

23:40.027 --> 23:42.695
So, uh, as of now, uh,
the Buy More

23:42.729 --> 23:44.347
is officially closed
for the holiday.

23:44.398 --> 23:46.149
Sorry!

23:46.183 --> 23:49.301
Thank you, come again
and, uh, and shop at Buy More.

23:49.319 --> 23:51.020
Sorry! Sorry!

23:51.071 --> 23:53.206
You're gonna have to...
gonna have to, kinda...

23:55.676 --> 23:56.776
Thanks, buddy.

23:56.810 --> 23:58.311
Well, come on, son,
I'll drive you home.

23:58.345 --> 24:01.781
Your mama's cooking us a
big, fat, honey-glazed ham.

24:01.815 --> 24:03.482
Aw... You know what?

24:03.500 --> 24:04.784
I'm gonna stay here
and close up shop.

24:04.818 --> 24:07.019
Can you make sure
everyone gets out safe?

24:07.054 --> 24:09.455
All right.
Okay.

24:09.489 --> 24:11.874
Hey. What's happening?

24:11.925 --> 24:14.126
Ellie, what are you...?
What are you...?

24:14.161 --> 24:16.796
We're-We're-We're
closing down for the night.

24:16.830 --> 24:19.765
The picture with
Santa was a bust.

24:19.800 --> 24:22.301
I sent Devon and Clara home.
Mom's flight's cancelled.

24:22.336 --> 24:24.103
Sarah was supposed to
help with the decorations,

24:24.137 --> 24:25.571
and now she's not
answering her phone.

24:25.606 --> 24:26.973
Have you heard from her?

24:27.007 --> 24:28.307
Yeah, uh, sort of.

24:28.342 --> 24:30.543
She's kind of busy.

24:31.879 --> 24:33.346
Chuck, what's going on?

24:35.649 --> 24:37.867
It's Shaw.

24:37.901 --> 24:40.419
He kidnapped Sarah.

24:40.454 --> 24:43.089
Daniel Shaw, who killed Dad?

24:44.925 --> 24:47.426
Um... what can I do?

24:47.461 --> 24:50.096
I... I hate to say this--
just-just go home.

24:50.130 --> 24:51.330
No, I want to help!

24:51.365 --> 24:52.865
Ellie, please, go home, okay?

24:52.883 --> 24:55.034
I have to know that you're safe.

24:56.553 --> 24:57.770
Okay, but call me.

24:57.804 --> 24:59.222
Call me as soon as you
know something, okay?

24:59.256 --> 25:00.473
Yes. Yes. Okay.

25:01.892 --> 25:03.876
Chuck, you be careful.

25:03.911 --> 25:05.561
I love you.

25:32.422 --> 25:34.407
You sick son of a bitch!

25:34.441 --> 25:35.508
Just wanted to see

25:35.542 --> 25:37.409
if any of the old fire
was still there.

25:37.427 --> 25:40.379
No. Ice-cold.

25:42.549 --> 25:44.600
This was Mary Bartowski's,
wasn't it?

25:44.635 --> 25:48.321
I think I'll keep it.

25:48.355 --> 25:50.189
Token of our last
night together.

25:52.258 --> 25:55.027
I had no idea she was
your wife, Shaw.

25:57.364 --> 25:59.131
I had no idea who you were.

25:59.166 --> 25:59.966
I was just...

26:00.000 --> 26:01.767
I was just on an assignment.

26:02.936 --> 26:05.871
Mm. Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

26:05.906 --> 26:07.873
I was just a young agent.

26:07.908 --> 26:09.675
I was just doing my job, okay?

26:09.710 --> 26:13.346
You, of all people,
need to understand that.

26:14.982 --> 26:16.849
Really?

26:16.883 --> 26:19.969
Well, what about the pit
you dug out of my chest?

26:20.003 --> 26:22.688
Is that supposed
to fill it in?

26:22.723 --> 26:24.724
Is this going to?

26:25.926 --> 26:27.393
You're a good man, Shaw.

26:27.427 --> 26:30.129
You can be that man again.

26:30.163 --> 26:33.298
Just stop what you're
doing, please.

26:33.317 --> 26:35.467
Okay?

26:35.485 --> 26:39.005
You can let this...
you can let this all go.

26:39.039 --> 26:41.273
I know you're in pain,

26:41.308 --> 26:45.077
and you want this
to stop, but not yet.

26:45.112 --> 26:47.613
Not until you feel a pain

26:47.647 --> 26:50.116
more excruciating than
you ever imagined.

26:53.120 --> 26:57.490
Chuck is coming up with a way
to stop you as we speak.

26:57.524 --> 27:00.042
We have reason to believe
this whole entire Omen virus,

27:00.093 --> 27:01.326
end of the world,
apocalyptic thingy--

27:01.345 --> 27:02.511
it's a hoax--
it's literally a hoax.

27:02.546 --> 27:04.163
The virus is
hypothetically designed

27:04.197 --> 27:06.165
to suck information out of
a whole set of computers

27:06.183 --> 27:08.100
and move that information
to a single location.

27:08.135 --> 27:09.368
But it's not doing that.
It's absolutely not doing that.

27:09.403 --> 27:11.804
Or it's not doing
that with our computers.

27:11.838 --> 27:14.106
It looks like this virus is
targeting government computers.

27:14.141 --> 27:16.842
I think it's a real-life
conspiracy.

27:16.877 --> 27:19.779
Problem is, no one computer can
hold all that information.

27:19.813 --> 27:20.780
Right? Right?

27:20.814 --> 27:23.065
Yeah. Of course not.
Of course not...

27:23.116 --> 27:24.734
Morgan, it's not going
into a computer.

27:24.785 --> 27:26.702
Shaw is using
the Macau Device

27:26.737 --> 27:29.288
to relocate the CIA
database into his brain.

27:29.322 --> 27:30.990
He's trying to create
the Intersect 3.0.

27:31.024 --> 27:33.993
Oh, crap. With the CIA's
databases wiped clean,

27:34.027 --> 27:35.795
they'll have to rely on Shaw
for their intel.

27:35.829 --> 27:37.630
They have to make him
a spy again.

27:37.664 --> 27:40.082
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen, uh...

27:40.133 --> 27:42.718
the Buy More is closed.
You can go home.

27:42.753 --> 27:44.136
Happy holidays.
Maybe drink some water.

27:44.171 --> 27:46.472
Water can only dilute
this feeling.

27:46.506 --> 27:47.706
Plus, fish have sex in it.

27:47.724 --> 27:48.908
Jeffrey, let's go
for a run.

27:48.942 --> 27:51.260
- Great idea. Great idea.
- Great idea.

27:55.182 --> 27:56.248
All right, Chuck,

27:56.283 --> 27:58.184
tell me you got some
kind of an idea here,

27:58.218 --> 27:59.402
'cause I'm a little scared.

27:59.436 --> 28:00.403
Don't freak out.

28:00.437 --> 28:01.570
I've got an idea.

28:01.605 --> 28:04.056
- Okay.
- I just hope it works.

28:04.074 --> 28:05.891
Me, too.

28:05.926 --> 28:08.928
Seeing as how our lives
kind of depend on it.

28:08.962 --> 28:10.162
You knew that, right?

28:10.197 --> 28:11.247
Yeah.

28:35.822 --> 28:37.123
You've got the device.

28:37.157 --> 28:38.824
Now let Sarah go
and take me instead.

28:38.859 --> 28:40.960
And why would I trust you?

28:40.994 --> 28:42.294
Look at the monitor.

28:46.266 --> 28:47.233
Buy More is empty.

28:47.267 --> 28:48.868
You can come up here
and kill me.

28:48.902 --> 28:51.504
As long as Sarah's safe.

28:56.676 --> 28:59.178
Pitiful.

29:18.565 --> 29:21.500
Good, you're awake.

29:21.535 --> 29:23.636
You know what
the ultimate revenge is?

29:23.670 --> 29:26.672
Spending Christmas Eve with you.

29:26.706 --> 29:28.507
I'm gonna let you live.

29:28.542 --> 29:31.010
I want you to watch
while I kill your husband.

29:32.913 --> 29:34.180
Chuck has a plan.

29:34.214 --> 29:36.148
So do I.

29:36.183 --> 29:40.553
And I've spent the last two
years in prison, perfecting it.

29:40.587 --> 29:43.189
You killed my wife.

29:43.223 --> 29:46.025
Now you're gonna suffer,
just like I did.

29:46.059 --> 29:50.529
You're gonna spend the rest of
your life without Chuck.

30:20.183 --> 30:23.085
Hi, I'm Mr. Pippers,
the Preppy Polar Bear.

30:23.142 --> 30:26.378
You can leave a message
by pressing hard on my paw.

30:26.412 --> 30:28.246
Have fun.

30:41.560 --> 30:44.195
Alex...

30:44.230 --> 30:46.231
Dad...

30:49.235 --> 30:51.736
I just want you to know
that I'm proud of you...

30:53.506 --> 30:56.508
...and I'm sorry I haven't been
there for you all these years.

31:02.314 --> 31:05.483
...and I'm really sorry that
I'm having to tell you this

31:05.518 --> 31:09.621
recorded on an electronic bear.

31:13.125 --> 31:15.193
Electronic bear.

31:49.295 --> 31:51.529
I'm unarmed.

31:51.547 --> 31:54.048
You can shoot me now,
if that's your plan.

31:54.083 --> 31:56.668
But for some reason,
I don't think it is.

31:56.702 --> 31:59.070
No, you're absolutely right.

31:59.105 --> 32:02.574
It's very important
that I enjoy this.

32:02.608 --> 32:04.058
Really?

32:04.093 --> 32:06.711
Well, that's a
nice idea, Shaw.

32:06.729 --> 32:08.480
However, if I
remember correctly,

32:08.514 --> 32:11.182
the last time we were face
to face, I kicked your ass.

32:13.018 --> 32:15.120
I made sure that'll
never happen again.

32:15.154 --> 32:17.188
No Intersect to help you
this time, Chuck.

32:17.223 --> 32:18.923
♪

32:18.958 --> 32:20.925
I wouldn't be too sure
about that.

32:20.960 --> 32:23.862
I've been training
for a while now.

32:23.896 --> 32:26.498
Oh, really?

32:26.532 --> 32:31.536
Well, can you compete
with the Intersect 3.0?

32:31.570 --> 32:34.572
I can practically
catch a bullet in my teeth.

32:34.607 --> 32:36.374
But you did some push-ups?

32:36.408 --> 32:38.176
You hit the heavy bag?

32:39.211 --> 32:40.545
Oh, just so
you know,

32:40.579 --> 32:42.013
while you're begging
for mercy,

32:42.047 --> 32:44.182
your wife is watching.

32:44.216 --> 32:47.418
♪

33:02.151 --> 33:04.869
I've spent every waking second
in jail

33:04.904 --> 33:06.704
thinking about this moment.

33:15.514 --> 33:17.448
This time,

33:17.466 --> 33:19.717
I'm going to kill you.

33:29.828 --> 33:32.163
You seriously underestimate
the power of the Nerd Herd.

33:33.199 --> 33:35.099
The Omen virus-- you put it...

33:35.134 --> 33:36.701
Inside your head.

33:36.735 --> 33:38.770
Instead of downloading
the Intersect 3.0,

33:38.804 --> 33:39.854
you removed it.

33:39.905 --> 33:41.322
And it turns out
that's the last flash

33:41.357 --> 33:42.774
you're ever going to have.

33:45.144 --> 33:47.178
I'm a much bigger nerd
than you thought I was.

33:56.222 --> 33:57.288
Oh, geez.

34:03.996 --> 34:05.496
Hey. Hey. Hey.

34:05.531 --> 34:06.931
Wake up. Wake...

34:06.966 --> 34:09.266
Oh, my God,
you're like an ice cube.

34:23.732 --> 34:25.867
Hang in there.
I got this. I got this.

34:25.900 --> 34:27.485
Uh, I'm going to pick you up
with the chair.

34:27.518 --> 34:28.820
All right, so just
bear with me.

34:28.853 --> 34:30.487
Okay.

34:33.025 --> 34:34.708
Oh, my God. Oh, man.

34:40.266 --> 34:42.199
One, two...

34:44.803 --> 34:46.971
I'm still going
to kill you.

34:47.005 --> 34:49.139
I'd like to see you try.

34:54.880 --> 34:56.130
I've been working
on that one.

34:56.181 --> 34:57.382
That one's for Sarah.

34:57.416 --> 34:58.716
Is that all you got?

34:58.750 --> 35:00.184
I got a little bit more.

35:07.626 --> 35:09.360
All right, listen to me.
Listen to me.

35:09.395 --> 35:11.562
You're going to have to wake up.
You have to wake up because

35:11.597 --> 35:13.398
you're bolted in here and I
don't have a key for the lock.

35:18.170 --> 35:20.438
What are you...? Y-you're shot.
You're-you're bleeding.

35:20.472 --> 35:22.624
Shut up, numbnuts.
We got to get her out of here.

35:24.576 --> 35:26.377
- Get her.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:29.948 --> 35:31.449
Whoa.

35:35.654 --> 35:36.804
"Dear"?

35:36.839 --> 35:38.756
"Hurry up, dear"?

35:38.790 --> 35:40.725
Sloppy, Shaw.

35:40.759 --> 35:42.460
Won't happen again.

35:57.176 --> 35:59.243
That was for my dad.

36:01.280 --> 36:03.081
You're good, Chuck.

36:04.500 --> 36:07.318
But you're not lucky.

36:13.625 --> 36:14.959
That was for me.

36:19.031 --> 36:20.631
Nice shot, sis.

36:22.501 --> 36:24.669
But I told you to stay at home.

36:27.706 --> 36:29.440
I'm Eleanor Woodcomb.

36:29.475 --> 36:32.510
Since when do I do
what I'm told?

36:34.713 --> 36:39.450
That man took our father
away from us, Chuck.

36:39.485 --> 36:42.854
I wasn't going to let him
take anybody else.

36:45.190 --> 36:47.392
Merry Christmas, Ellie.

36:49.411 --> 36:51.412
Merry Christmas, Chuck.

36:58.964 --> 37:01.656
Authorities have confirmed,
that the Omen virus

37:01.657 --> 37:04.592
was planted by a terrorist
named Daniel Shaw.

37:04.946 --> 37:07.547
A private security team
stopped him

37:07.581 --> 37:09.316
before the virus was activated.

37:09.350 --> 37:11.718
And although they've chosen
to remain anonymous,

37:11.753 --> 37:14.187
we here at KCKH
want to say thank you

37:14.222 --> 37:18.291
and also wish our viewers
a happy holiday.

37:18.326 --> 37:21.761
And now, onto other news,
where a dog barks like a duck.

37:21.779 --> 37:23.830
All members
of Carmichael Industries

37:23.865 --> 37:26.032
have a position open to them
at the CIA.

37:26.067 --> 37:29.069
The agency would be
lucky to have you back.

37:29.103 --> 37:31.037
Well, we couldn't have
done it without you.

37:31.072 --> 37:33.440
So thanks, colleague.

37:33.474 --> 37:35.909
With that,
I'll bid you farewell

37:35.943 --> 37:37.477
and Merry Christmas.

37:40.114 --> 37:42.983
Do you have a place
to spend the holidays?

37:43.017 --> 37:44.317
You could come
to our place.

37:44.352 --> 37:45.752
Yeah, but,
Sarah, I think

37:45.787 --> 37:46.820
my Christmas party's a bust.

37:46.854 --> 37:48.088
No, no, no, no.

37:48.122 --> 37:50.657
Your Christmas party
is not a bust, sis.

37:50.691 --> 37:52.626
Don't you know
that when you roll

37:52.660 --> 37:54.127
with General
Diane Beckman,

37:54.162 --> 37:55.796
you roll in style?

37:56.764 --> 37:59.015
General...

37:59.066 --> 38:02.102
don't you think the CIA

38:02.136 --> 38:04.604
could help us throw
just a little

38:04.639 --> 38:09.176
eensy-weensy Bartowski family
Christmas party?

38:11.112 --> 38:14.614
You're talking about American
tax dollars at work.

38:16.284 --> 38:18.451
Oh, hell, let's do it.

38:18.486 --> 38:20.253

Aw.

38:34.218 --> 38:35.969
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

38:36.003 --> 38:38.188
I know that without
Mom and Dad around,

38:38.222 --> 38:39.539
it could never be

38:39.574 --> 38:41.708
a perfect Christmas,
but I hope you know

38:41.742 --> 38:43.543
that you'll always have me.

38:43.578 --> 38:45.212
I do.

38:45.246 --> 38:47.714
Felt pretty good
taking down Shaw.

38:47.748 --> 38:49.049
Mmm.

38:49.083 --> 38:51.184
I think Dad would be proud.

38:52.954 --> 38:55.121
I know he would be.

38:57.058 --> 38:59.226
I miss him.

38:59.260 --> 39:01.294
Me, too.

39:01.329 --> 39:03.096
I love you.
I love you, too.

39:03.130 --> 39:04.231
Merry Christmas.

39:06.167 --> 39:08.301
I, uh...

39:08.336 --> 39:12.172
made a recording when
things got a little grim.

39:13.224 --> 39:15.508
It's just that...

39:15.542 --> 39:18.812
it's probably better
I tell you in person.

39:21.582 --> 39:23.717
I love you.

39:23.751 --> 39:26.219
I love you, too, Dad.

39:26.254 --> 39:29.606
I know it's a...
just a little bear.

39:29.657 --> 39:31.074
It's not going to make up

39:31.108 --> 39:32.609
for all the lost
holidays, but...

39:32.660 --> 39:36.062
No, it's... it's perfect.

39:38.565 --> 39:39.866
You know, that...

39:39.900 --> 39:41.618
that Grimes kid,
he's not that bad.

39:41.669 --> 39:44.671
You should...
maybe give him another chance.

39:58.102 --> 39:59.786
It was fun, man.

Like old times,

40:01.188 --> 40:02.588
before you
got all smart.

40:02.607 --> 40:05.358
It's actually the only
Christmas Eve I remember.

40:05.393 --> 40:07.560
I'm usually drunk on
Manischewitz by now.

40:07.595 --> 40:08.962
I miss that.

40:09.981 --> 40:11.298
Thank you.

40:11.332 --> 40:13.199
For defeating
Daniel Shaw?

40:13.234 --> 40:15.268
For stopping
the Omen virus?

40:15.303 --> 40:19.605
Or was it me getting us
invited to rejoin the CIA?

40:20.625 --> 40:22.208
For saving me.

40:22.243 --> 40:23.476
Technically, Morgan saved you.

Because of all the saving
that was going on,

I wasn't able to
get you your gift

40:30.151 --> 40:33.219
in time for Christmas;
however... however...

40:37.858 --> 40:40.126
An oldie, but a goodie.

40:41.646 --> 40:43.763
I hope that this will
suffice for now.

40:45.433 --> 40:47.100
Thank you.

Smile!

Oh, now she'll
always be able

40:53.607 --> 40:54.841
to remember her
first Christmas.

40:54.875 --> 40:56.609
Yeah.

41:00.665 --> 41:02.816
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

Chuck, you should
know that, um,

41:05.536 --> 41:09.756
while I was tied up in Castle,
Shaw kissed me.

41:11.959 --> 41:14.227
Well, as long as we're
airing things out,

41:14.261 --> 41:16.196
you should know...

41:16.230 --> 41:18.631
that Beckman kissed me.

41:20.101 --> 41:21.801
Walker.

41:21.836 --> 41:23.703
A word.

41:27.675 --> 41:29.726
Uh...

41:29.777 --> 41:32.045
General, I know about the, um...

41:32.079 --> 41:34.197
with you and Chuck.

41:34.231 --> 41:36.549
We all have to make sacrifices
for the job.

41:37.752 --> 41:41.388
Shaw requested a meet with you.

41:41.422 --> 41:44.224
I suggest you
don't go.

42:10.317 --> 42:11.985
What?

42:12.019 --> 42:13.853
I'm glad you came.

I'll be locked in solitary
the rest of my life.

But one thing's
going to keep me warm at night.

Little something
I put into motion

be able to stop.
