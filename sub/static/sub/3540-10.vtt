00:02.134 --> 00:03.761
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:03.936 --> 00:06.632
For over a century,
I have lived in secret, until now.

00:06.805 --> 00:09.035
I know the risk,
but I have to know her.

00:09.241 --> 00:12.074
- She's a dead ringer for Katherine.
- Hello, brother.

00:12.277 --> 00:13.437
Damon.

00:13.612 --> 00:16.206
There's nothing about
that Logan guy I killed in here.

00:16.382 --> 00:18.282
- Covering it up.
- It's a small circle.

00:18.517 --> 00:22.419
- Founding families, a few city officials.
- I will do anything I can to help.

00:22.588 --> 00:25.455
Alaric Saltzman.
I'm your new history teacher.

00:25.624 --> 00:28.218
- That's a cool ring.
- Thanks. It was my father's.

00:28.394 --> 00:31.056
I have to leave.
Too many people have died.

00:31.230 --> 00:33.755
- I can't be a part of your life anymore.
- Don't go, Stefan.

00:33.966 --> 00:34.990
Goodbye, Elena.

00:35.167 --> 00:37.226
You know what,
I'm not gonna invite you in.

00:37.403 --> 00:39.166
- Some other time then.
- I was dumped.

00:39.405 --> 00:40.463
Yeah, well, Logan's a jerk.

00:43.342 --> 00:45.173
- Hello, Jenna.
- Logan.

00:45.411 --> 00:46.935
Aren't you gonna invite me in?

00:51.050 --> 00:52.847
Why are you here, Logan?

00:53.085 --> 00:55.679
I missed you. I was out of town.

00:55.854 --> 00:58.049
Yeah, I got that e-mail.

00:58.857 --> 01:00.290
You got an e-mail?

01:01.160 --> 01:02.559
You didn't send an e-mail?

01:06.165 --> 01:09.157
I can explain. Just invite me in
and I'll tell you everything.

01:09.334 --> 01:11.564
I'm not gonna invite you in. Forget it.

01:11.770 --> 01:14.466
Come on, Jenna, it's me.

01:15.574 --> 01:17.439
- The answer is no.
- I know you.

01:18.310 --> 01:20.938
You're always one step
from a "maybe."

01:22.147 --> 01:24.479
A tiny nudge to "yes."

01:25.918 --> 01:28.079
You just pointed out
that I have no self-control.

01:29.388 --> 01:30.480
Clever strategy.

01:48.640 --> 01:50.335
Evening.

02:10.895 --> 02:12.261
Hey.

02:12.431 --> 02:14.695
You're that guy from the news,
Logan Fell.

02:15.501 --> 02:16.900
I watch you every night.

02:17.136 --> 02:20.162
Well, I used to. I mean,
you've been missing from my TV.

02:20.339 --> 02:22.398
- I took some time off.
- I noticed.

02:23.709 --> 02:25.336
I'm Daphne.

02:26.145 --> 02:28.409
- Hey, you know something, Daphne?
- No, what?

02:41.293 --> 02:42.954
"I live in fear.

02:43.162 --> 02:44.595
It consumes me.

02:44.796 --> 02:48.562
In the early evening, when I see
the sun begin to fade, the fear comes.

02:49.434 --> 02:52.198
Because I know
that the night brings death."

03:42.821 --> 03:44.448
Jeremy's got his sketch pad out.

03:45.290 --> 03:47.451
- You're kidding.
- Nope, but don't say a word.

03:47.626 --> 03:49.457
The minute we encourage him,
he'll put it away.

03:49.661 --> 03:52.926
Psychology major. Check that.

03:56.935 --> 03:58.334
And you and Stefan?

03:59.037 --> 04:01.665
- Update?
- He knows how I feel and where I stand.

04:01.840 --> 04:04.138
And I know where he stands,
but it doesn't matter.

04:04.309 --> 04:06.436
He's leaving, moving away.

04:06.612 --> 04:08.978
- Where's he going?
- I've stopped asking questions.

04:09.147 --> 04:10.808
- The answers get scary.
- Oh.

04:11.683 --> 04:14.151
Yours leaves, mine returns.

04:14.319 --> 04:15.343
Logan?

04:15.520 --> 04:17.180
- He's back.
- Ugh.

04:17.389 --> 04:20.449
- I didn't let him pass the front door.
- I hope you slammed it in his face.

04:20.625 --> 04:23.390
- Ah, medium slam.
- Three-strike rule, Jenna.

04:23.629 --> 04:25.620
You're not even allowed
to watch the news.

04:25.797 --> 04:28.288
Exactly. No more Logan "Scum" Fell.

04:28.467 --> 04:30.697
So any idea of where you'll go?

04:30.869 --> 04:32.564
I don't know. London, maybe.

04:32.771 --> 04:35.137
- See some friends.
- You don't have any friends, Damon.

04:35.307 --> 04:37.775
You're right, Stefan. I only have you.

04:38.510 --> 04:41.377
- So where are we going?
- "We" are not going anywhere.

04:42.014 --> 04:44.847
I'm gonna live my life
as far away from you as possible.

04:45.017 --> 04:47.986
But we're a team.
We could travel the world together.

04:48.153 --> 04:49.950
We could try out
for The Amazing Race.

04:50.122 --> 04:52.317
Mm. That's funny.

04:52.491 --> 04:53.981
Seriously, where are you going?

04:54.159 --> 04:55.786
Because we're not staying
in this town.

05:02.034 --> 05:04.093
I'm here to see Damon.

05:04.269 --> 05:06.066
Uh, sure. Okay.

05:06.305 --> 05:09.706
Sheriff. What a surprise.

05:09.875 --> 05:11.843
Sorry to bother you,
but we need to talk.

05:13.545 --> 05:15.069
Come in.

05:21.953 --> 05:24.854
I hope you understand the secrecy.
Stefan doesn't know about this yet.

05:25.023 --> 05:27.014
- I'd like to keep it that way.
- Of course.

05:27.192 --> 05:30.855
- Kids are too young to be brought into this.
- So, what do you need?

05:31.029 --> 05:32.860
There's been another attack.

05:33.031 --> 05:36.194
A female victim, her throat torn out,
completely drained of blood.

05:36.368 --> 05:38.893
- It fits the pattern.
- I'm sorry. I don't understand.

05:39.071 --> 05:43.269
I thought we solved that problem
when I staked the blond one.

05:43.442 --> 05:45.433
I'm thinking she must have turned
someone.

05:45.610 --> 05:47.441
Or multiple someones, I don't know.

05:47.646 --> 05:49.443
The story is another animal attack...

05:49.614 --> 05:52.048
...but I'm not sure how long
we can keep lying to them.

05:52.250 --> 05:55.913
The Council is in an uproar.
We thought we were past this.

05:57.222 --> 05:59.213
So, uh, what do we do?

05:59.424 --> 06:01.585
You're the only one
who's taken on a vampire.

06:01.760 --> 06:04.251
We were hoping you could tell us.

06:09.401 --> 06:12.268
And then the ballet dancer
and the crunker did the salsa.

06:12.437 --> 06:13.734
I was awake for that part.

06:13.905 --> 06:16.567
Well, I don't know
when you fell asleep.

06:16.775 --> 06:19.005
Um, did you see the Celine Dion waltz
about cancer?

06:19.177 --> 06:20.974
Those always make me cry.

06:21.146 --> 06:22.670
Yeah.

06:22.881 --> 06:27.147
Then the loud judge kept screaming
and I couldn't take it so I turned it off.

06:27.452 --> 06:31.149
I sat through Family Guy,
so you owed me.

06:31.390 --> 06:33.085
Did I miss something?

06:33.291 --> 06:34.485
They've been hanging out.

06:34.659 --> 06:37.822
- Kind of weird, don't you think?
- She needs someone nice like him.

06:37.996 --> 06:40.294
As opposed to a homicidal vampire
like Damon.

06:41.032 --> 06:43.330
Yeah, how are you doing
with all that?

06:43.502 --> 06:45.129
I'm freaked out.

06:45.303 --> 06:47.931
Damon attacked me.
I could be dead right now.

06:48.106 --> 06:50.540
- But I'm also grateful.
- Hmm?

06:50.776 --> 06:54.177
- To Stefan. He saved my life.
- Mm.

06:56.181 --> 06:57.512
Have you seen him?

06:57.682 --> 07:01.709
Not since he told me he was leaving.
For all I know, he's already gone.

07:02.120 --> 07:04.054
He wouldn't leave
without saying goodbye.

07:04.222 --> 07:07.055
Yes, he would.
He thinks he's protecting me.

07:07.225 --> 07:08.487
Clean break and all that.

07:08.693 --> 07:09.955
So, what are you gonna do?

07:10.128 --> 07:13.029
What am I supposed to do?
I already begged him not to go.

07:13.198 --> 07:15.632
If I ask again, I'm being selfish.

07:15.834 --> 07:17.825
- It is what it is.
- Oh. Maybe it's for the best.

07:18.003 --> 07:19.129
What? Why?

07:19.304 --> 07:23.536
I mean, what kind of future could you
have had with him, even if he stayed?

07:24.176 --> 07:25.734
- Let me tie it tighter.
- Sorry.

07:27.746 --> 07:30.340
- Did you just...?
- No, I swear.

07:30.515 --> 07:33.006
- Ah. God.
- How's that You got it?

07:33.185 --> 07:34.812
Thank you for stopping by.

07:35.020 --> 07:37.887
- Let me know.
- Absolutely.

07:40.959 --> 07:43.519
What is wrong with you?
You killed somebody?

07:43.695 --> 07:44.992
Get off of me.

07:45.163 --> 07:47.495
A, don't touch me.

07:47.666 --> 07:50.226
B, if I had, I wouldn't have been
so obvious about it.

07:50.469 --> 07:54.098
And C,
there's another vampire in town.

07:55.106 --> 07:57.199
- That's impossible.
- Obviously not.

07:58.577 --> 08:00.044
Well, who could it be?

08:00.212 --> 08:04.239
Ah, what do we care?
We're leaving anyway, right?

08:04.416 --> 08:07.977
No, I can't leave now,
and you know that.

08:08.587 --> 08:11.055
How are we supposed
to find this person?

08:11.223 --> 08:13.885
Let the adults handle this stuff.

08:17.229 --> 08:18.287
See you later, okay?

08:18.497 --> 08:20.362
- Okay.
- Bye.

08:36.414 --> 08:37.607
Hi.

08:40.919 --> 08:43.751
We need to talk.

08:46.424 --> 08:49.086
- So, what's up with you and Forbes?
- Nothing's up.

08:49.261 --> 08:52.389
I saw you two in the hall today.
Don't even try and deny it, bro.

08:52.564 --> 08:54.327
- You're tapping that.
- No. It's not like that.

08:54.566 --> 08:56.932
Never is. Till you become we people.

09:00.038 --> 09:01.835
- "We people"?
- Yeah.

09:02.073 --> 09:03.597
"We can't make it to the party."

09:03.775 --> 09:05.072
"We'll never miss a game."

09:05.243 --> 09:06.767
"We don't like the color red."

09:07.445 --> 09:09.072
We hung out, like, twice.

09:09.848 --> 09:11.679
Like I said, "we."

09:13.184 --> 09:15.584
So you have no idea who it could be?

09:15.754 --> 09:17.449
None.

09:17.789 --> 09:20.849
But it must be somebody new,
because leaving a body like that...

09:21.059 --> 09:23.823
...they're either sloppy
or they're trying to send a message.

09:23.995 --> 09:27.590
- And you're sure it's not Damon?
- Well, I'm never sure about Damon...

09:27.766 --> 09:31.827
...but he's been trying to keep a low
profile so it doesn't make sense to me.

09:32.571 --> 09:34.596
So, what are you gonna do?

09:34.773 --> 09:36.604
Damon is tracking them right now.

09:37.976 --> 09:39.443
Look.

09:40.278 --> 09:42.303
I promised you the truth...

09:42.480 --> 09:46.007
...so I wanted to tell you.
I want you to be careful.

09:51.256 --> 09:54.657
When I saw you, I thought
you were coming to say goodbye.

09:58.597 --> 10:00.394
Not yet.

10:07.272 --> 10:10.139
- Hey, what do you think?
- Creepy.

10:10.308 --> 10:14.506
I found this old journal in Dad's stuff.
Jonathan Gilbert, from the 1800's.

10:14.713 --> 10:15.737
He's kind of a freak show.

10:15.914 --> 10:18.382
He wrote about demons
and all these people getting slaughtered...

10:18.550 --> 10:21.747
Yeah, he was a writer.
Short stories, horror stuff.

10:21.920 --> 10:23.217
Oh, he wrote fiction?

10:23.989 --> 10:26.253
Figured he was just a lunatic
or a drunk.

10:27.492 --> 10:29.392
Well, he was a Gilbert.

10:29.561 --> 10:31.620
Probably a little bit of both.

10:37.402 --> 10:40.565
- So, what do I do now?
- Just wait. I'll be there in a minute.

10:40.739 --> 10:42.707
Can you hurry? I have things to do.

10:42.907 --> 10:44.499
You can give me that.

10:46.845 --> 10:48.506
So why did you need me to do this?

10:48.680 --> 10:51.012
Because I interfere with the signal.

10:52.017 --> 10:55.714
Look, can I go now?
This has blown, like, half of my day.

10:56.955 --> 10:59.856
You do that.
Get in your car, go home.

11:00.025 --> 11:01.754
Forget I asked you to do this.

11:02.594 --> 11:05.927
- Okay. Bye now.
- Bye.

11:52.077 --> 11:56.173
I have tons of these wooden bullets,
so nothing funky.

11:56.381 --> 11:58.212
You don't wanna do this, trust me.

12:00.385 --> 12:02.410
- That's what you get.
- For what?

12:02.620 --> 12:06.317
- You made me like this.
- I killed you but I didn't turn you.

12:06.491 --> 12:08.823
See, I know what you
and your brother are.

12:08.993 --> 12:11.928
I've been watching the two of you.
I knew you'd show up here.

12:12.097 --> 12:14.930
And I'm glad you did
because I have some questions.

12:15.133 --> 12:16.998
Me first. Who turned you?

12:17.202 --> 12:18.635
How should I know?

12:18.837 --> 12:21.670
Last thing I remember
is I'm about to stake your brother...

12:21.840 --> 12:24.274
...and then you grab me. That's it.

12:24.476 --> 12:30.346
Until I wake up in the ground behind
a used-car dealership on Highway 4.

12:30.515 --> 12:32.312
Somebody buried me.

12:32.484 --> 12:35.453
It happens. Ow. Unh.

12:36.321 --> 12:39.119
- You bit me. It had to be you.
- Damn it.

12:39.324 --> 12:42.782
You have to have vampire blood
in your system when you die.

12:42.961 --> 12:44.292
I didn't do that.

12:44.462 --> 12:47.522
Some other vampire found you,
gave you their blood.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.997
- Who?
- That's what I wanna know.

12:51.169 --> 12:55.037
It's not like the welcome wagon was waiting
with a Bundt cake and a handbook.

12:55.273 --> 12:57.503
It's been a learn-as-you-go process.

12:57.675 --> 13:01.236
One minute,
I'm a small-town, on-the-rise news guy...

13:01.446 --> 13:03.880
...and next thing I know,
I can't get into my house.

13:04.048 --> 13:06.039
Because my foot won't go through the door.

13:06.284 --> 13:08.115
- You have to be invited in.
- I know.

13:08.286 --> 13:10.447
- I live alone.
- Oh, that sucks.

13:10.622 --> 13:13.352
Now, I'm at the Ramada,
watching pay-per-view all day...

13:13.525 --> 13:16.119
...eating everything in sight,
including Housekeeping.

13:16.294 --> 13:17.454
It could be worse.

13:17.629 --> 13:19.494
All I can think about is blood.

13:19.697 --> 13:22.029
And killing people.
I can't stop killing people.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.168
I keep killing. Ha, ha.

13:24.369 --> 13:26.200
And I like it.

13:26.404 --> 13:27.666
I'm conflicted.

13:27.872 --> 13:29.134
Welcome to the club.

13:31.075 --> 13:33.566
Wait a minute.
The cops only found one body.

13:33.812 --> 13:36.178
I left one. I was tired.

13:36.347 --> 13:39.316
I've been hiding the rest of the bodies.
They're right back there.

13:39.484 --> 13:42.282
- You're kidding.
- They're just piling up.

13:48.827 --> 13:50.317
Thank you, sir. Nice to see you.

13:51.362 --> 13:54.024
Let's try to make something clear

13:54.199 --> 13:56.394
So, what do we know?

13:56.568 --> 13:58.502
Nothing new to report yet.

14:01.039 --> 14:03.200
My highly reliable deputies
are all on alert.

14:03.374 --> 14:05.865
But if you feel the need
to be more proactive...

14:06.077 --> 14:08.068
...by all means,
grab a stake, and have at it.

14:08.246 --> 14:09.736
What extra precautions can we take?

14:09.914 --> 14:12.405
Right now there's nowhere safer
than a crowded public place.

14:12.617 --> 14:15.177
And for once, mayor,
we actually know where our kids are.

14:26.564 --> 14:30.261
- What do you want?
- Hey, uh, just surprised to see you here.

14:30.435 --> 14:35.031
Art usually implies culture
and culture implies... Well, not you.

14:35.573 --> 14:37.564
Go to hell.

14:41.379 --> 14:43.574
Where we stand

14:43.748 --> 14:45.716
What it means

14:47.852 --> 14:49.717
And what has come between

14:49.888 --> 14:53.153
- Still wanna be an astronaut?
- Ha, ha. I can't believe you remember that.

14:53.358 --> 14:55.849
I remember the tinfoil
that you wore on your head.

14:56.060 --> 14:57.425
I was 8.

15:01.099 --> 15:02.157
How are you doing?

15:04.269 --> 15:05.964
I've had it easier.

15:07.672 --> 15:08.730
You?

15:09.507 --> 15:12.305
I mean, I heard some things.

15:14.312 --> 15:15.973
So it's true then, you and Stefan?

15:16.447 --> 15:18.278
Yeah, it is.

15:19.150 --> 15:21.948
What about you, Matt Donovan?

15:23.755 --> 15:26.883
- I heard about Caroline.
- Uh, man, not you too.

15:27.058 --> 15:29.117
- Hey.
- We're friends.

15:30.428 --> 15:32.521
- It's not a big deal.
- No?

15:33.331 --> 15:34.958
No.

15:46.444 --> 15:48.275
Why am I so overly emotional?

15:49.013 --> 15:51.504
All I can think about
is my ex-girlfriend.

15:51.683 --> 15:53.776
I wanna be with her,
and bite her and stuff.

15:54.552 --> 15:55.951
Well, you probably love her.

15:56.154 --> 15:59.317
Anything you felt before
will be magnified now.

15:59.524 --> 16:01.856
You're gonna have to learn
how to control that.

16:02.060 --> 16:04.028
What about walking in the sun?

16:04.195 --> 16:05.526
I'm a morning person.

16:05.697 --> 16:09.463
You can walk in the sun.
Which, by the way, is pretty cool.

16:09.634 --> 16:13.035
The Council would never suspect you.
That's not in the journals.

16:13.705 --> 16:15.866
- The journals?
- Yeah, the founding fathers...

16:16.040 --> 16:19.840
...they passed down journals to
their kids. Come on, you gotta tell me.

16:20.044 --> 16:22.171
How can you walk around in the sun?

16:22.347 --> 16:25.248
- Who turned you?
- How do you walk in the sun?

16:25.950 --> 16:27.440
Who turned you?

16:27.652 --> 16:29.677
You know, I've been really nice so far.

16:29.854 --> 16:31.754
But I will kill you.

16:31.990 --> 16:33.958
Then you'll never know.

16:36.260 --> 16:39.024
- You're not answering my question.
- You first.

16:39.197 --> 16:41.324
It seems we're at
a bit of an impasse then, doesn't it?

16:41.499 --> 16:43.729
I have things to do, people to kill.

16:44.469 --> 16:46.596
I guess I'll be needing
a little head start.

16:51.909 --> 16:54.036
Ah. Damn it.

16:54.212 --> 16:57.545
I'm guessing you're not here
to plan the path for your future.

17:00.685 --> 17:02.915
You're looking out for me.

17:04.222 --> 17:05.382
I hope that's okay.

17:19.203 --> 17:23.105
You know, I wanted to be a doctor...

17:23.273 --> 17:25.571
...before everything happened.

17:25.810 --> 17:28.278
But, uh, then I couldn't because...

17:28.445 --> 17:30.277
The blood?

17:30.748 --> 17:32.443
Yeah.

17:33.084 --> 17:36.884
I've dabbled in a bunch
of different things though.

17:37.221 --> 17:39.451
Didn't love anything enough
to stick to it?

17:39.624 --> 17:42.457
No, I loved it all. I just...

17:42.627 --> 17:48.964
I had to move on before anybody could
notice that I wasn't getting any older.

17:50.902 --> 17:53.666
- How long before that would happen?
- A few years, usually.

17:54.972 --> 17:57.031
Sometimes shorter.

17:57.542 --> 17:58.941
And you always left?

17:59.143 --> 18:00.610
I didn't have a choice.

18:05.049 --> 18:08.416
So, what about...? What about you?

18:08.586 --> 18:11.020
What are your, uh, plans for the future?

18:11.189 --> 18:13.987
I don't wanna talk
about my future, Stefan.

18:14.158 --> 18:18.094
Because everything you're saying is
making it perfectly clear you're not in it.

18:19.163 --> 18:21.256
Well, it's not that
I don't wanna be in it...

18:21.432 --> 18:22.797
You can't. I get it.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.992
I heard you the first time
and the second time.

18:26.170 --> 18:28.297
And I appreciate you
looking out for me...

18:28.473 --> 18:31.374
...but, please,
if you're gonna leave, then just go.

18:35.179 --> 18:36.840
- Hide me.
- What's going on?

18:37.014 --> 18:38.504
The "Scum" Fell has landed.

18:39.484 --> 18:41.349
Logan's here?

18:41.986 --> 18:43.214
Wait, Logan Fell?

19:06.677 --> 19:08.269
Stefan, what's going on?

19:08.446 --> 19:11.108
Jenna, are you dodging me?

19:11.282 --> 19:13.250
It's a form of self-preservation.

19:13.417 --> 19:16.784
Um, Elena, why don't you and Jenna
go somewhere else.

19:18.990 --> 19:20.014
Let's go.

19:24.762 --> 19:26.525
What are you doing here?

19:26.764 --> 19:28.698
You know, your brother asked me
the same thing.

19:28.900 --> 19:32.859
In fact, why don't we just skip past
all that "who turned me" stuff...

19:33.037 --> 19:35.267
...and get the answer that I want.

19:35.439 --> 19:37.134
How can I turn into a day-walker?

19:37.308 --> 19:39.776
Damon and I
are the only two that I know of.

19:39.944 --> 19:42.174
But you're both very cagey
on the how.

19:42.346 --> 19:44.143
Which tells me that there is a way.

19:45.349 --> 19:50.651
You know, in case you hadn't noticed,
I'm quite the celebrity in this town.

19:51.189 --> 19:54.989
It would be very, very easy for me
to expose you.

19:57.662 --> 20:01.098
You wanna know
how you can walk around in the sun?

20:01.332 --> 20:02.356
I do.

20:05.369 --> 20:06.700
You can't.

20:08.606 --> 20:13.043
Don't ever threaten me again.

20:19.450 --> 20:22.010
When Logan came to the house,
what did he say?

20:22.186 --> 20:25.747
Oh. Fake flattery, stupid dimpled grin,
puppy-dog eyes.

20:25.923 --> 20:27.083
I'm serious, Jenna.

20:27.325 --> 20:30.351
- How did he act? What did he say?
- He was the usual Logan.

20:30.528 --> 20:33.554
He was charming,
a little more manic than usual.

20:33.764 --> 20:36.528
He kept trying to convince me
to let him in.

20:37.702 --> 20:39.431
What?

20:39.637 --> 20:41.935
Okay, listen to me very carefully.

20:42.106 --> 20:44.973
Do not, under any circumstances,
talk to him again.

20:45.142 --> 20:47.042
I'm serious, Jenna. Like, ever.

20:49.113 --> 20:51.638
Hey, Elena. Jenna.

20:51.882 --> 20:53.281
Hi, Mr. Saltzman.

20:53.484 --> 20:56.078
- Yeah, I was hoping to see you here.
- Career Night is the new bowling.

20:58.256 --> 21:00.121
Okay. Um, excuse me.

21:00.291 --> 21:01.781
Logan Fell is a vampire.

21:01.993 --> 21:07.397
And when I find him again,
I am gonna destroy him, limb by limb.

21:07.598 --> 21:08.758
What happened? You okay?

21:08.933 --> 21:10.798
No, I'm not okay.

21:11.002 --> 21:12.560
I was ambushed.

21:12.737 --> 21:14.671
I was shot.

21:15.740 --> 21:18.675
Now I'm vengeful.
Just gotta find him.

21:18.876 --> 21:19.968
Well, there's no need.

21:20.177 --> 21:22.236
- He's here at the school.
- You're kidding me.

21:22.413 --> 21:25.177
- Why the hell is he there?
- He's working the crowd.

21:25.816 --> 21:27.511
Well, I'll be right there.

21:29.453 --> 21:30.647
So?

21:30.821 --> 21:33.312
Anything you'd like to share?

21:33.491 --> 21:36.585
- What are you doing?
- Following my future.

21:37.128 --> 21:39.653
- There it is.
- "Broadcast journalism"?

21:39.830 --> 21:43.266
Yes. Broadcast journalism.

21:45.469 --> 21:47.198
Why are you looking at me like that?

21:48.172 --> 21:50.037
You don't even read the paper.

21:54.945 --> 21:56.003
Liz.

21:58.316 --> 21:59.647
Logan.

21:59.817 --> 22:01.512
What are you gonna do, stake me?

22:01.719 --> 22:06.213
Bury me in another shallow grave.
What would the e-mail say this time?

22:06.457 --> 22:07.924
I didn't have a choice.

22:08.125 --> 22:09.615
You bitch.

22:10.294 --> 22:11.955
I died for you.

22:12.129 --> 22:13.426
For this town.

22:13.964 --> 22:16.626
You've known me since I was 6.

22:17.301 --> 22:19.929
And you swept me under the rug
like dirt.

22:20.137 --> 22:23.072
- You knew what you were getting into.
- I was one of you.

22:23.941 --> 22:25.465
And now you're one of them.

22:31.716 --> 22:34.184
Watch your back, sheriff.

22:39.523 --> 22:41.184
Get a backup team to the school.

22:41.359 --> 22:44.089
Keep it within the circle. It's a V5.

22:44.995 --> 22:46.656
I didn't know you drew.

22:46.831 --> 22:48.731
- It's an elective.
- It's good stuff.

22:48.899 --> 22:51.197
You like graphics?
Because that's kind of my thing.

22:51.369 --> 22:53.929
Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

22:54.105 --> 22:56.573
Well, it's just something else
we have in common.

22:56.774 --> 22:58.241
And what's the other thing? Vicki?

22:58.843 --> 23:01.004
Let's hang out
because we did the same chick?

23:01.178 --> 23:04.909
Go be friends with one of the many other
guys she screwed. There's no shortage.

23:06.650 --> 23:08.709
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.

23:08.886 --> 23:10.376
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Break it up.

23:11.355 --> 23:15.348
- All right, work it out, tough guy.
- You two, follow me.

23:17.895 --> 23:21.092
Excuse me, mayor,
where are you taking them?

23:21.298 --> 23:22.424
I'm gonna talk to them.

23:22.600 --> 23:25.433
All fights should end in handshakes,
don't you think? Come on.

23:27.638 --> 23:29.606
Bonnie, where are you?
I'm ready to go.

23:29.774 --> 23:31.708
I'll be outside.

23:31.876 --> 23:35.039
Hey, damsel in distress, need a ride?

23:35.212 --> 23:38.010
Oh, my God. Logan Fell,
Channel 9, is that you?

23:38.182 --> 23:40.776
I used to babysit you, Caroline Forbes.
Don't mock me.

23:41.786 --> 23:45.085
Well, I was supposed to go home
with Bonnie but I can't find her.

23:46.157 --> 23:47.954
It's not a problem, really.

23:48.726 --> 23:50.557
- It's on my way.
- Okay.

24:03.474 --> 24:06.341
- You know, this is fate.
- And why is that?

24:06.577 --> 24:08.807
Because I'm interested
in broadcast journalism.

24:08.979 --> 24:10.742
So can I ask you a couple questions?

24:10.915 --> 24:14.043
Anything you want.
But first, buckle up.

24:14.251 --> 24:15.946
Okay.

24:27.998 --> 24:29.022
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:29.200 --> 24:31.031
Have you seen Logan Fell,
the news guy?

24:31.202 --> 24:33.432
Yeah. He just gave Caroline
a ride home.

24:35.806 --> 24:37.671
Stay here.

24:44.782 --> 24:48.047
Okay, let's get this
out of your system.

24:48.519 --> 24:50.453
Go ahead. Fight.

24:50.921 --> 24:51.979
You want us to what?

24:53.057 --> 24:55.116
I'm not gonna fight him, Dad.

24:55.326 --> 24:56.816
I don't think so, sir.

24:57.027 --> 25:01.020
You don't fight in there like pansies.

25:01.232 --> 25:05.635
You take it outside, fight your battles
like men, and move on.

25:06.871 --> 25:08.839
That's the lesson my dad taught me.

25:09.340 --> 25:12.309
So let's settle it. Fight.

25:12.510 --> 25:15.240
- Come on, Dad.
- No, it's not gonna happen.

25:16.580 --> 25:17.706
I said, fight.

25:17.882 --> 25:20.009
Whoa. What's going on out here?

25:20.518 --> 25:22.577
I'm just letting these two kids
work it out.

25:22.753 --> 25:26.484
- We're good here. Go back inside.
- I don't wanna go back inside.

25:27.391 --> 25:29.985
What I want is an answer
to my question.

25:30.160 --> 25:31.457
What's going on out here?

25:33.531 --> 25:35.726
Who do you think you're talking to?

25:36.600 --> 25:38.761
- Do I look like a student?
- No.

25:38.969 --> 25:41.335
You look like a full-grown,
alpha-male douche bag.

25:42.740 --> 25:45.106
You don't talk to me like that.

25:49.346 --> 25:50.370
You do that.

25:51.181 --> 25:54.742
Then it'll be you and me
in this parking lot, working things out.

25:55.686 --> 25:57.176
You cool with that?

25:58.756 --> 26:01.350
- You just marked yourself.
- Okay.

26:13.604 --> 26:14.798
You all right?

26:20.110 --> 26:21.202
Where are you?

26:21.378 --> 26:24.108
Your daughter has expressed
an interest in journalism.

26:24.315 --> 26:26.909
I think it's important
to foster young minds.

26:28.752 --> 26:29.878
What do you want?

26:30.087 --> 26:33.215
The satisfaction of turning your daughter
into a vampire.

26:43.467 --> 26:44.798
Payback's a bitch, isn't it?

26:47.037 --> 26:48.664
Get her out of here.

26:48.906 --> 26:51.431
Logan, what happened Logan?

26:51.642 --> 26:53.906
Sheriff, it's Damon.

26:54.111 --> 26:56.170
- Where's Caroline?
- She's okay.

26:56.347 --> 26:57.575
Uh, I'm on Elm Street.

27:07.358 --> 27:10.327
I'm gonna try this one more time.

27:13.497 --> 27:15.795
- Who turned you?
- I told you, I don't know.

27:17.301 --> 27:20.793
This tire iron here
could take your head clean off.

27:20.971 --> 27:23.804
- Is that your final answer?
- How can you side with them?

27:23.974 --> 27:27.375
I don't side with anyone.
You pissed me off, I want you dead.

27:27.878 --> 27:29.470
- Who turned you?
- I don't know.

27:29.680 --> 27:31.580
- Oh, well, then you're screwed.
- Wait!

27:31.782 --> 27:33.215
- I do know.
- You're lying.

27:33.384 --> 27:35.852
Think you're the only one
who wants in that tomb...

27:36.020 --> 27:38.079
...underneath the old church?

27:38.288 --> 27:40.017
If you are lying me, I will end you.

27:40.190 --> 27:43.717
I am not lying. There's another way
to break the spell. We can help you.

27:43.961 --> 27:45.428
Meet me at the old church.

27:46.797 --> 27:48.958
Take me down. Make it look real.
Make it look real.

27:54.038 --> 27:55.369
- Where is she?
- She's okay.

27:56.473 --> 27:58.338
My brother is taking her home.

27:58.509 --> 28:00.534
I'm sorry, sheriff.

28:01.111 --> 28:02.408
I just wasn't strong enough.

28:09.753 --> 28:10.879
All right.

28:14.725 --> 28:16.852
- Caroline?
- She's okay, I took her home.

28:17.061 --> 28:20.588
She was shaken up, but all she knows
is Logan attacked her, nothing else.

28:20.764 --> 28:22.789
- Where's Logan?
- Damon is...

28:22.966 --> 28:24.456
...dealing with him.
- As in?

28:29.606 --> 28:32.268
You saw what happened tonight,
right?

28:32.976 --> 28:38.278
I mean, you understand
why we can't be together? You see it?

28:38.449 --> 28:41.816
Yeah, I'm starting to see
a lot of things, Stefan.

28:43.620 --> 28:44.951
Come on, I'll, uh...

28:45.189 --> 28:46.213
I'll give you a ride.

28:47.725 --> 28:49.249
Uh, I can get home.

28:50.260 --> 28:51.693
I know.

28:53.597 --> 28:55.792
All right, that would be nice.

29:03.340 --> 29:04.898
Hey.

29:06.343 --> 29:08.140
What do you want?

29:08.312 --> 29:09.836
I don't know.

29:10.013 --> 29:12.345
I, uh, thought that was weird
with your dad.

29:12.516 --> 29:13.813
What he did.

29:14.351 --> 29:18.515
Is he like that all the time?
Is that what you gotta go through?

29:19.089 --> 29:20.420
Man, I get it.

29:20.624 --> 29:22.421
I get it.

29:24.461 --> 29:26.622
- What's your problem?
- Look, I don't need your pity.

29:26.797 --> 29:28.287
You don't have to be like this.

29:28.465 --> 29:30.524
- You don't.
- Just go.

29:31.101 --> 29:33.035
What is your problem, man?

29:33.237 --> 29:35.762
I don't know, okay?

29:37.608 --> 29:39.303
I don't know.

29:51.321 --> 29:55.189
What I said before,
about you leaving, it was harsh.

29:55.359 --> 29:57.190
No, you had every right.

30:01.698 --> 30:05.657
You asked me
what I want my future to be.

30:07.638 --> 30:09.196
I wanted to be a writer.

30:10.641 --> 30:13.974
My mom sort of pushed me
into that direction...

30:14.178 --> 30:16.578
...from the time I was able to read.

30:16.780 --> 30:21.183
She supported me, encouraged me,
bought me my first journal.

30:21.852 --> 30:22.978
And then she died.

30:24.822 --> 30:28.849
And I can't see myself
being a writer anymore.

30:29.026 --> 30:30.721
That was something that we shared.

30:32.095 --> 30:35.189
You think that you brought
all of this bad stuff into my life...

30:35.365 --> 30:36.832
...but my life already had it.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.365
I was buried in it.

30:38.569 --> 30:40.332
This is different.

30:40.571 --> 30:43.734
It doesn't make it any less painful.

30:47.878 --> 30:51.177
I know that it's hard to understand...

30:53.217 --> 30:55.617
...but I'm doing this for you.

31:10.734 --> 31:12.326
No.

31:13.971 --> 31:16.030
You don't get to make
that decision for me.

31:16.206 --> 31:17.901
If you walk away, it's for you.

31:18.075 --> 31:20.475
Because I know what I want.

31:22.112 --> 31:24.546
Stefan, I love you.

32:20.837 --> 32:22.464
Don't.

32:23.707 --> 32:25.299
Elena, I can't.

32:25.475 --> 32:26.635
Yes, you can.

32:28.312 --> 32:30.473
Don't hide from me.

34:44.014 --> 34:46.676
- Who are you?
- A friend of Jenna's.

34:47.884 --> 34:48.908
Jenna sent you?

34:49.485 --> 34:51.818
No, I came on my own.

34:53.023 --> 34:55.014
Ah. I get it.

34:55.992 --> 35:00.895
Well, I know you think this makes you
brave, but actually it makes you stupid.

35:01.465 --> 35:04.195
Either way, here I am.

35:05.936 --> 35:07.096
What do you want?

35:07.304 --> 35:10.171
Jenna's a good person,
and she deserves the best.

35:10.340 --> 35:12.331
I'm here to make sure she gets it.

35:12.909 --> 35:14.638
Was that supposed to be a threat?

35:15.679 --> 35:21.618
Couldn't you throw a punch
or maybe provoke me a little?

35:23.386 --> 35:25.411
I'm not a violent guy by design.

35:25.622 --> 35:28.921
- You're not a very smart one, either.
- And how is that?

35:30.994 --> 35:33.656
Because you have no idea
who you're talking to.

35:53.683 --> 35:55.082
I need a ride.

35:55.252 --> 35:56.446
Sure.

35:58.054 --> 35:59.078
Look, I like Caroline.

35:59.322 --> 36:02.382
She's got this thing, this way about her
and I like her, okay?

36:02.559 --> 36:04.959
And I'm not gonna defend it
or apologize about it.

36:05.695 --> 36:09.187
- Okay.
- So stop your little bromance bitch act.

36:10.500 --> 36:12.058
Okay.

36:33.023 --> 36:34.513
Yeah.

36:37.894 --> 36:39.794
I'll be right there.

36:44.201 --> 36:46.897
I've never been in your room before.

36:47.070 --> 36:48.560
Hmm.

36:48.738 --> 36:51.730
Well, it hasn't changed much
over the years.

36:52.642 --> 36:55.543
Do you just leave everything here
when you come and go?

36:55.745 --> 37:00.375
It's the only place
that has remained constant.

37:00.550 --> 37:02.040
This room holds every memory...

37:02.219 --> 37:05.086
...that I ever thought was important
enough to hold on to.

37:08.425 --> 37:10.791
A lot of memories.

37:11.061 --> 37:12.460
Yeah.

37:12.662 --> 37:15.028
You thirsty or anything?

37:15.632 --> 37:18.465
A little. You?

37:19.202 --> 37:21.227
- Oh.
- Heh.

37:22.038 --> 37:23.767
I'm fine.

37:23.940 --> 37:26.101
I'm gonna get you something
to drink, okay?

37:26.276 --> 37:27.903
Okay.

38:07.050 --> 38:09.780
- Hello?
- I just wanted to say thank you.

38:10.287 --> 38:12.152
I don't know how you did it.

38:12.355 --> 38:13.845
Uh, I'm not following.

38:14.090 --> 38:16.456
We found Logan's body
by the old Fell warehouse.

38:16.660 --> 38:18.321
It's been disposed of.

38:18.495 --> 38:21.293
He was hoarding victims.
Innocent victims.

38:21.464 --> 38:22.488
What?

38:22.699 --> 38:25.167
This town owes you so much.

38:25.335 --> 38:27.098
So do I.

38:36.246 --> 38:38.111
Elena?
