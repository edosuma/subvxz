16:36.256 --> 16:38.127
some questions.

16:38.258 --> 16:41.130
Yeah. Just a few.

16:41.261 --> 16:45.178
It's for the best that you know
as little as possible.

16:45.308 --> 16:47.615
You don't work for the U.N.,
do you?

16:47.745 --> 16:49.443
And neither does Dad.

16:49.573 --> 16:52.228
Well, technically speaking,

16:52.359 --> 16:55.492
our agency does...

You're a spy.

Yes, I am.

-Anna...
-No, I knew it.

17:10.464 --> 17:12.466
I did. I fucking knew it.

17:12.596 --> 17:15.382
I'm really sorry
you had to find out like this.

17:15.512 --> 17:18.602
No, Mum, are you kidding?
I'm...

17:18.733 --> 17:20.039
I'm relieved.

17:21.823 --> 17:24.826
Do you know I used
to make up these stories?

17:24.956 --> 17:26.915
That you were superheroes,

17:27.046 --> 17:29.961
which meant Dad was trying
to save the world and...

17:30.092 --> 17:32.181
[chuckles]
Mum did.

17:32.312 --> 17:33.835
But there was that...

17:33.965 --> 17:35.706
that one person
who she couldn't reach in time,

17:35.837 --> 17:37.882
and that's what she replayed
in her head when she used.

17:38.013 --> 17:39.667
Look, I know it sounds stupid.
I was eight.

17:39.797 --> 17:41.408

We're not superheroes.

Okay?

Maybe you are for putting up
with us all this time.

17:49.720 --> 17:52.984
I'm just glad I know the truth.

17:53.115 --> 17:54.551
You must remember
it's the kind of truth that,

17:54.682 --> 17:56.553
if you tell anyone,

lives are at risk.
