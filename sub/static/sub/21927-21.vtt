00:01.376 --> 00:02.867
<i>Previously, on</i> Young Sheldon...

00:03.295 --> 00:05.332
I've been corresponding
with Dr. John Sturgis

00:05.547 --> 00:06.754
at East Texas Tech.

00:06.965 --> 00:08.547
He said I could audit
his course.

00:08.759 --> 00:10.500
Connie, I would like
to see you again.

00:10.719 --> 00:12.506
Perhaps we could have
dinner sometime.

00:12.930 --> 00:14.546
Yes, we would love that.

00:15.265 --> 00:16.050
We would?

00:16.433 --> 00:18.299
If they get married,
we immediately double

00:18.519 --> 00:20.351
the number of smart people
in our family.

00:21.313 --> 00:22.679
Hello, Dr. Sturgis.

00:22.898 --> 00:23.684
Hello, Sheldon.

00:23.899 --> 00:26.516
Can you see yourself
living here? I can.

00:31.698 --> 00:34.816
Mmm. Good ratio of hot dog
chunks to spaghetti.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.743
I've been experimenting.
Glad you noticed. Kids!

00:37.955 --> 00:39.992
Wash up for dinner!

00:40.207 --> 00:41.539
Now, who on earth is that?

00:42.960 --> 00:45.293
And don't be picking out
all the chunks.

00:45.504 --> 00:46.665
Aw.

00:52.427 --> 00:53.963
Sorry I'm a little late.

00:54.179 --> 00:57.138
My pant leg
got stuck in the chain.

00:57.599 --> 00:58.464
Who are you?

00:58.934 --> 01:00.345
I'm John Sturgis.

01:01.520 --> 01:03.182
Sheldon invited me to dinner.

01:03.814 --> 01:04.849
Aha.

01:05.440 --> 01:08.274
Okay. Um, come in, I guess.

01:08.485 --> 01:09.350
Sheldon?

01:09.987 --> 01:11.023
Coming!

01:11.530 --> 01:12.737
This is for you.

01:13.365 --> 01:16.153
It's cheese and
summer sausages.

01:16.451 --> 01:17.316
Thank you.

01:17.536 --> 01:20.370
Summer sausage means it
doesn't need to be refrigerated.

01:20.914 --> 01:21.870
Is that so?

01:22.207 --> 01:22.947
It is.

01:23.417 --> 01:24.533
Okay. Sheldon?

01:25.085 --> 01:26.496
Dr. Sturgis, welcome.

01:26.837 --> 01:27.873
Thank you, Sheldon.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.125
Sheldon, you think
you might've let me know

01:30.340 --> 01:31.831
you invited company
over for dinner?

01:32.050 --> 01:34.508
I did think about it, but
I was afraid you might say no.

01:34.720 --> 01:35.881
Come see my train set.

01:36.263 --> 01:37.094
All right!

02:03.290 --> 02:04.280
Good Lord.

02:04.499 --> 02:05.990
You mean he just showed up
out of nowhere?

02:06.209 --> 02:09.293
Yep. He's out in the garage
playing trains with Sheldon.

02:10.255 --> 02:11.120
Why's your hair wet?

02:11.381 --> 02:12.292
If you must know,

02:12.507 --> 02:13.543
I was doing my water aerobics,

02:13.759 --> 02:15.250
and my swimming cap fell off.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.461
This Sturgis fella didn't
say a word to you?

02:17.679 --> 02:19.716
If he did, do you think I would
have been doing frog kicks

02:19.931 --> 02:21.763
at the YMCA?

02:22.559 --> 02:23.424
You look great.

02:27.481 --> 02:30.394
O gauge trains
are definitely the best.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.267
<i>O</i>, yes, they are.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.729
Oh, well,
what a pleasant surprise.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.572
Oh, good. You're here, too.

02:38.784 --> 02:40.116
I am.

02:40.494 --> 02:41.610
Are y'all about ready
for dinner?

02:41.995 --> 02:42.781
I am.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.203
Well, then, let's go.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.156
Meemaw, you smell like chlorine.

02:46.375 --> 02:48.742
- Why say it?
- Hmm.

02:52.464 --> 02:53.420
You weren't kidding.

02:53.924 --> 02:56.837
Spaghetti and hot dogs
is delightful.

02:57.260 --> 02:57.920
Even better

02:58.136 --> 02:59.752
since Mom perfected
the chunk ratio.

03:00.764 --> 03:02.756
So, Dr. Sturgis,
Sheldon tells us

03:02.974 --> 03:04.465
you're a guest professor
at the university.

03:04.685 --> 03:05.675
- I am.
- Hmm.

03:05.894 --> 03:07.977
Does that mean that
you're only here temporarily?

03:08.188 --> 03:09.975
Well, that's the plan for now.

03:10.774 --> 03:14.893
But I could be enticed to stay.

03:16.238 --> 03:18.230
Meemaw, I do believe
there was subtext there.

03:18.448 --> 03:19.564
Did you pick up on it?

03:19.950 --> 03:20.815
Yeah.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.070
Was I correct to infer

03:22.285 --> 03:23.150
there was subtext there?

03:23.370 --> 03:24.281
You were.

03:24.496 --> 03:25.486
Okay, we're all good.

03:27.666 --> 03:29.248
I can't believe
they're making me sit and eat

03:29.459 --> 03:30.575
at the kiddie table.

03:30.836 --> 03:32.668
- It's better here.
- How?

03:32.963 --> 03:34.875
We don't have to pray,
eat our vegetables,

03:35.090 --> 03:36.376
and we can curse.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.166
Hmm. Maybe you're right.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.342
Course I am, you ass-face.

03:42.472 --> 03:43.963
Dr. Sturgis,
do you think

03:44.182 --> 03:45.764
we're ever going
to unify gravity

03:45.976 --> 03:47.933
with the other three
fundamental forces?

03:48.895 --> 03:51.137
I have a sticky note
on my refrigerator

03:51.356 --> 03:54.064
which reminds me every day
to do just that.

03:54.276 --> 03:56.643
When did you decide to focus your research

03:56.862 --> 03:57.898
- on quantum...
- Um, Sheldon, I think

03:58.113 --> 04:00.105
you're kind of dominating
the conversation.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.899
Why don't you let your
meemaw talk to Dr. Sturgis.

04:03.869 --> 04:05.531
Oh, I'm sorry. By all means.

04:05.746 --> 04:06.577
Thank you.

04:07.414 --> 04:09.406
- Connie?
- Yes, John.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.334
Do you smell like chlorine
on purpose?

04:16.589 --> 04:18.047
You sure I can't give you
a ride home?

04:18.257 --> 04:19.999
I can throw your bike
in the back of my pickup truck.

04:20.218 --> 04:23.131
Thank you, no.
I-I enjoy the night air.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.257
Plus,

04:24.473 --> 04:25.384
hot dogs and spaghetti

04:25.599 --> 04:27.090
is a highly caloric event

04:27.309 --> 04:30.268
that demands an aerobic
effort on my part.

04:30.687 --> 04:33.100
Well, it was a pleasure
spending the evening with you.

04:33.315 --> 04:34.431
We should do it again sometime.

04:34.649 --> 04:36.015
Great. When?

04:36.234 --> 04:37.065
How about tomorrow?

04:37.277 --> 04:38.893
You know what,
we'll figure it out.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.354
Come on, let me see you
to your Schwinn.

04:42.032 --> 04:42.818
Bye.

04:43.158 --> 04:44.274
Good night.

04:45.702 --> 04:47.159
Well, that was
the most stimulating dinner

04:47.370 --> 04:48.827
I've ever had in this house.

04:49.039 --> 04:50.075
Glad you enjoyed it.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.077
That man is a true role model.

04:52.501 --> 04:54.709
Well, it's nice you finally
got a man you can look up to.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.536
Oh, believe me, I know.

05:06.723 --> 05:07.839
You gonna keep it
all bottled up,

05:08.058 --> 05:09.799
- or you want to talk about it?
- What?

05:11.061 --> 05:11.676
I'm fine.

05:11.895 --> 05:12.760
There's nothing to talk about.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.390
- You sure?
- Yeah.

05:15.273 --> 05:16.389
Sweet dreams.

05:24.366 --> 05:25.732
You know you want
to talk about it.

05:25.951 --> 05:27.067
You saw it.

05:27.285 --> 05:29.402
My own son can't even imagine me
being a role model?

05:29.621 --> 05:31.157
How am I supposed to
be okay with that?

05:31.373 --> 05:33.239
You're a role
model for Georgie.

05:33.458 --> 05:34.574
I used to be.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.997
Now he wants to grow up
and be Tony Danza.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.124
Did you forget you
have a daughter

05:39.339 --> 05:40.671
who would really benefit

05:40.882 --> 05:43.044
from having a good
man to look up to?

05:44.261 --> 05:44.967
Oh, dear Lord.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.589
Yo <i>u did</i> forget.

05:47.055 --> 05:48.512
I didn't forget. I just...

05:48.932 --> 05:50.468
I don't know how
to spend time with her.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.258
It ain't rocket
science, George.

05:52.477 --> 05:53.433
She's a little girl.

05:53.645 --> 05:54.806
Ask her what she wants to do,

05:55.021 --> 05:56.387
and then do it with her.

05:56.606 --> 05:58.689
Oh, yeah. I suppose.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.855
Trust me. She'll be thrilled
to spend some time with you.

06:02.571 --> 06:03.277
Okay.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.153
Yeah, I'll give it a try.

06:07.909 --> 06:10.617
Hey, when we do, you know,
whatever it is she likes to do,

06:10.829 --> 06:12.070
you're gonna be there, right?

06:12.581 --> 06:13.287
No.

06:15.709 --> 06:16.916
Well, this just got harder.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.086
Meemaw?

06:26.261 --> 06:27.342
Meemaw!

06:28.555 --> 06:29.341
What?

06:30.098 --> 06:31.179
I've been researching things

06:31.391 --> 06:33.053
that you and I can do
with Dr. Sturgis.

06:33.268 --> 06:34.304
There's a lecture tonight

06:34.519 --> 06:35.885
at Rice University called

06:36.104 --> 06:37.811
"What's happening
at the center of our galaxy."

06:38.023 --> 06:39.389
Let me just stop you
right there.

06:39.608 --> 06:41.816
Don't worry. I know
what's happening at the center,

06:42.027 --> 06:43.438
but I would never spoil it
for you.

06:43.987 --> 06:45.478
Look, I know you're invested

06:45.697 --> 06:47.154
in me and John
having a relationship,

06:47.365 --> 06:48.822
and I'm not saying we won't.

06:49.284 --> 06:51.901
But it ain't gonna happen
with you always underfoot.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.448
Have I been underfoot?

06:53.830 --> 06:56.322
Honey, in order for grown-ups

06:56.541 --> 06:57.952
to get to know each other,

06:58.293 --> 07:00.159
they need to have
some alone time.

07:01.212 --> 07:04.080
What if I'm around,
but I took a vow of silence?

07:04.299 --> 07:05.835
Go home and have your breakfast.

07:07.469 --> 07:08.550
And then she said for grown-ups

07:08.762 --> 07:09.843
to get to know each other,

07:10.055 --> 07:11.717
they have to have time alone.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.594
Makes sense. What else?

07:13.975 --> 07:17.594
Apparently my being underfoot
isn't conducive to romance.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.348
This is very helpful.

07:19.564 --> 07:20.680
Thank you.

07:20.899 --> 07:22.106
I'm at your service.

07:30.116 --> 07:31.607
Oh, Celeste, why do you always

07:31.826 --> 07:32.942
fall for bad boys?

07:33.787 --> 07:34.493
Hey.

07:34.704 --> 07:35.410
Hi, Dad.

07:35.622 --> 07:36.908
What you doing?

07:37.123 --> 07:38.079
Am I in trouble?

07:38.541 --> 07:41.329
No, no.
Just-just checking in on you.

07:41.544 --> 07:42.705
Why?

07:43.254 --> 07:45.291
'Cause you're my daughter
and I love you.

07:45.924 --> 07:47.210
This is getting weird.

07:47.425 --> 07:49.382
It is. I was just
thinking that, uh,

07:49.719 --> 07:50.880
you and me, you know,

07:51.096 --> 07:52.303
we don't spend much
time together.

07:52.681 --> 07:54.513
You know, we should
find something to do,

07:54.724 --> 07:55.965
just-just two of us.

07:56.184 --> 07:57.470
- Like what?
- You tell me.

07:57.686 --> 07:59.552
What-what sounds fun?

08:01.982 --> 08:03.518
I'd like to be taken to dinner.

08:03.733 --> 08:06.100
Great. Where?

08:06.611 --> 08:09.194
To the fanciest restaurant
in all of Texas.

08:10.031 --> 08:10.896
Which is...?

08:11.116 --> 08:14.075
Red Lobster,
where the surf meets the turf.

08:15.912 --> 08:16.743
You got it.

08:16.955 --> 08:17.866
Thanks, Dad.

08:18.707 --> 08:20.243
Mom, you got to
take me shopping!

08:20.458 --> 08:21.869
I need a dress!

08:26.172 --> 08:27.003
Yeah?

08:27.215 --> 08:29.298
Connie, this is John Sturgis.

08:29.509 --> 08:30.670
Well, hello, John Sturgis.

08:30.885 --> 08:31.921
How are you?

08:32.386 --> 08:34.504
I chipped a tooth
on a peach pit this morning,

08:34.722 --> 08:36.840
but otherwise, I'm okay.

08:37.058 --> 08:38.299
Good. Good to hear it.

08:38.518 --> 08:39.884
Next order of business.

08:40.102 --> 08:42.345
I would like to have dinner
with you tonight,

08:42.688 --> 08:43.679
just the two of us.

08:44.315 --> 08:47.683
Oh, well, that sounds nice.

08:47.902 --> 08:49.063
What'd you have in mind?

08:49.320 --> 08:54.156
I'd like to come to your house
and cook you a Szechuan feast.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.570
I'm sorry, a what?

08:55.785 --> 08:56.821
Szechuan.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.620
It's a style
of Chinese cooking I learned

08:59.831 --> 09:01.823
when I was traveling
through China.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.867
Well, wonderful.
I would love that.

09:05.086 --> 09:06.918
Great. Do you have a wok?

09:07.714 --> 09:08.830
I do not.

09:09.132 --> 09:10.043
Not a problem.

09:10.258 --> 09:11.374
I have a travel wok.

09:12.719 --> 09:13.630
Okay.

09:13.845 --> 09:16.883
Uh, so, uh,
what do you say about 6:00?

09:17.098 --> 09:18.134
It's a date.

09:18.349 --> 09:19.260
Terrific.

09:19.768 --> 09:23.136
Oh, and, um, let's not
mention this to Sheldon

09:23.354 --> 09:25.971
so as to keep him
from being underfoot.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.357
Have you been talking to him?

09:28.568 --> 09:30.605
I have. See you later.

09:37.869 --> 09:40.202
Do I really need to get
dressed up to go to Red Lobster?

09:40.413 --> 09:41.904
You're getting dressed up
for your daughter.

09:42.123 --> 09:44.740
And that's a new shirt,
so be sure to ask for a bib.

09:44.959 --> 09:45.824
Oh!

09:49.464 --> 09:50.625
I'm ready.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.923
You're going to
dinner wearing that?

09:53.301 --> 09:55.588
I think you mean
she looks beautiful.

09:57.013 --> 09:58.174
You look beautiful.

09:58.389 --> 09:59.800
Why thank you, George.

10:00.517 --> 10:02.099
How 'bout we stick
with "Dad" tonight?

10:02.393 --> 10:04.055
Okay, but you call me Melissa.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.646
After you, Melissa.

10:08.191 --> 10:09.181
Thanks, George.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.331
Oh, my.

10:33.550 --> 10:35.132
I know, I look like

10:35.343 --> 10:38.302
a Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtle.

10:38.513 --> 10:39.924
Well, come on in.

10:45.895 --> 10:47.682
Sheldon, come in the kitchen
for dinner.

10:47.939 --> 10:49.896
- Can I eat out here?
- Why?

10:50.275 --> 10:53.018
Dr. Sturgis is having
a dinner date with Meemaw.

10:53.236 --> 10:54.272
I don't want to miss it.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.023
Fine.

10:58.324 --> 11:01.317
<i>During that time,
I saw three cars drive by</i>

11:01.536 --> 11:03.949
<i>and a raccoon dragging
a slice of pizza.</i>

11:16.342 --> 11:17.298
Uh, table for two.

11:17.969 --> 11:18.709
No problem.

11:22.557 --> 11:23.673
Allow me.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.008
You are allowed.

11:29.355 --> 11:30.141
Thank you.

11:30.356 --> 11:31.642
Yes, thank you.

11:32.942 --> 11:33.853
If I may.

11:38.656 --> 11:40.192
So what do you think?

11:40.408 --> 11:42.775
I think we might
be underdressed.

11:50.627 --> 11:53.745
The trick to a successful
Szechuan dinner

11:53.963 --> 11:55.420
is the Szechuan pepper.

11:55.715 --> 11:56.876
Okay.

11:57.258 --> 11:58.794
Now, you may notice

11:59.010 --> 12:01.343
your lips and tongue
getting numb.

12:01.763 --> 12:03.629
Then why are we eating it?

12:03.890 --> 12:05.381
'Cause it's yummy.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.386
Sure.

12:08.144 --> 12:10.386
So, what were you doing
wandering around China?

12:10.605 --> 12:14.770
Well, when I'm not doing
research or teaching,

12:15.443 --> 12:18.277
I enjoy taking the
path less traveled.

12:18.488 --> 12:21.026
I'm guessing it's a bike path.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.449
As a matter of fact, it was.

12:23.660 --> 12:26.027
Everybody in China
rides bicycles.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.657
It's fantastic.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.989
- Did you see the Great Wall?
- I did.

12:30.500 --> 12:31.616
Interesting fact:

12:32.001 --> 12:33.833
it's filled with
the dead bodies

12:34.045 --> 12:35.331
of the people
who built it.

12:36.172 --> 12:37.288
You don't say.

12:37.507 --> 12:39.624
Hundreds of thousands of them.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.003
Here, taste.

12:45.306 --> 12:47.548
If it's just the two of us,
why can't I eat watching TV?

12:48.017 --> 12:49.758
'Cause you're having dinner
with your mother

12:49.978 --> 12:51.685
and it's a chance
for us to talk.

12:52.146 --> 12:54.229
Sheldon's having dinner and
looking out the window.

12:54.649 --> 12:55.890
Want me to have him join us?

12:56.109 --> 12:56.724
No.

12:56.943 --> 12:58.150
Then quit complaining.

13:00.571 --> 13:02.028
So what do you
want to talk about?

13:02.240 --> 13:03.731
Um, I don't know.

13:04.325 --> 13:05.111
How's school?

13:05.785 --> 13:07.572
It's school;
it's a turd fest.

13:08.913 --> 13:09.869
Charming.

13:11.165 --> 13:12.281
Are you dating anyone?

13:12.667 --> 13:14.659
Nah, nobody up to my standards.

13:15.211 --> 13:16.201
Sure.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.291
Can I ask you
a question?

13:18.506 --> 13:20.498
Course, you can
ask me anything.

13:20.717 --> 13:22.925
Were you pregnant with me
when you married Dad?

13:24.637 --> 13:27.129
Um... why would you ask that?

13:27.765 --> 13:28.551
Sheldon said so.

13:28.766 --> 13:29.722
How would Sheldon know?

13:29.934 --> 13:31.721
- He did the math.
- What math?

13:31.936 --> 13:33.723
He said the time
between my birthday

13:33.938 --> 13:35.975
and your wedding day
was six months.

13:36.274 --> 13:38.687
Um... yeah.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.189
That's because you...

13:41.863 --> 13:43.820
were born premature.

13:44.032 --> 13:45.523
I've seen my birth certificate,

13:45.908 --> 13:47.399
it said I weighed nine pounds.

13:48.119 --> 13:49.326
Yes, that's true.

13:50.371 --> 13:53.455
You were a big fat preemie.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.078
Let's talk about
something else.

13:56.544 --> 13:57.159
Why?

13:57.378 --> 13:58.835
'Cause I'd very much like to.

14:00.798 --> 14:02.414
And then Heather B
said she didn't want

14:02.633 --> 14:04.465
to play tetherball
with Heather M anymore.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.418
Wait. Th-There's two Heathers?

14:06.637 --> 14:07.468
Oh, yeah.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.670
Which one's which?

14:08.931 --> 14:09.967
Heather B
is stuck up.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.719
Heather M used
to be stuck up,

14:11.934 --> 14:13.766
but then she got
a scoliosis brace.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.469
Maybe she shouldn't
be playing tetherball.

14:16.064 --> 14:18.021
That's what Heather B said.

14:20.068 --> 14:21.104
This is delicious,

14:21.319 --> 14:24.357
but you were not kidding
about the spice.

14:24.572 --> 14:25.904
I'm about to break
a sweat here.

14:26.115 --> 14:28.198
Well, here's something

14:28.409 --> 14:29.991
you might find interesting.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.492
Spicy food is typically
found in warmer climates

14:33.706 --> 14:35.368
because it
induces sweating,

14:35.583 --> 14:37.996
which in turn,
cools people off.

14:38.252 --> 14:40.244
So what does the runny nose
do for me?

14:40.797 --> 14:43.084
It allows me to, uh,

14:43.341 --> 14:46.800
gallantly offer you
my handkerchief.

14:47.095 --> 14:48.256
You are such a gentleman.

14:48.471 --> 14:49.427
When I was younger,

14:49.639 --> 14:51.756
I read a book
on etiquette.

14:52.141 --> 14:53.382
That's how I know

14:53.601 --> 14:55.388
that if I ever have an
audience at the Vatican,

14:55.603 --> 14:58.562
I should wear evening
attire or a sack coat.

14:58.773 --> 15:01.311
I don't know
what a sack coat is,

15:01.526 --> 15:04.735
but I'm sure
you'd look handsome in it.

15:05.905 --> 15:06.986
Thank you.

15:10.493 --> 15:13.281
You know, it's a long
bike ride at night.

15:14.956 --> 15:15.912
If you want...

15:17.750 --> 15:19.082
you're welcome to stay.

15:19.377 --> 15:22.666
No, it's fine, I-I have
a headlight on my bicycle.

15:23.131 --> 15:24.793
Oh, sure, sure.

15:28.344 --> 15:29.835
Although, I hear
it might rain.

15:30.513 --> 15:33.881
No worries. I have
a pocket poncho.

15:34.725 --> 15:35.966
So you do.

15:37.854 --> 15:38.935
John.

15:40.648 --> 15:41.638
I'm inviting you

15:41.858 --> 15:44.191
to spend the night.

15:44.485 --> 15:45.521
Oh.

15:48.406 --> 15:49.647
No, thank you.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.662
Don't they make babies
that are born too soon

15:57.874 --> 15:58.864
stay in the hospital?

15:59.500 --> 16:02.914
Normally, yes, but you were born

16:03.129 --> 16:05.712
with such a great head
full of hair

16:05.923 --> 16:07.459
that they sent you home with us.

16:08.885 --> 16:11.218
That's the first thing you've
said that makes sense.

16:12.722 --> 16:14.679
I'm glad we had dinner;
this was nice.

16:15.099 --> 16:16.431
Yeah, fun stuff.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.972
Well, don't want to miss
<i>Who's The Boss.</i>

16:24.108 --> 16:26.395
Lord, forgive me for lying.

16:26.611 --> 16:28.273
I'll tell him the truth
when he's 30. Amen.

16:30.573 --> 16:31.984
Your lobster, madam.

16:32.283 --> 16:33.319
Thank you.

16:36.746 --> 16:38.362
Would you like me
to open it for her?

16:38.581 --> 16:39.867
Oh, I got it, thanks.

16:42.460 --> 16:45.043
- You all right?
- This thing's freaking me out.

16:45.546 --> 16:47.162
Here, let me help you with that.

16:48.966 --> 16:51.208
Here. Okay.

16:52.428 --> 16:54.545
The trick is not
to make eye contact.

16:54.764 --> 16:55.800
Tell him.

16:56.015 --> 16:56.880
Here.

16:57.642 --> 17:00.885
All right, now,
we just... snap her off

17:01.103 --> 17:02.890
like that... pop.

17:04.065 --> 17:05.521
Grab this guy here,

17:06.108 --> 17:07.064
and we crack the claw.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.981
And then you take out
a little meat...

17:12.240 --> 17:13.821
dunk it in some butter,

17:14.450 --> 17:15.406
and then you eat it.

17:18.287 --> 17:19.277
Holy moly.

17:19.497 --> 17:20.532
It's good, huh?

17:20.748 --> 17:21.659
Unbelievable.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.115
I'll leave you to it.

17:24.919 --> 17:26.580
No. Sit with me.

17:29.590 --> 17:30.250
Okay.

17:33.469 --> 17:36.132
When I grow up, I'm gonna
eat lobster every night.

17:36.472 --> 17:39.010
Well, hon, you better stay in
school and get a good education.

17:39.642 --> 17:41.759
I was thinking I'd
just marry a rich guy.

17:42.687 --> 17:44.178
Sure, that's a way to go.

17:45.231 --> 17:47.063
Or a guy who works
at Red Lobster.

17:47.692 --> 17:48.978
That's another way to go.

18:03.958 --> 18:06.416
You seem quiet.
Is everything okay?

18:07.336 --> 18:09.043
Are you not interested in me?

18:09.380 --> 18:11.793
Of course I am.
I'm very interested.

18:12.008 --> 18:13.294
Then how come when I...

18:13.926 --> 18:17.010
I invited you to spend
the night, I got rejected?

18:18.264 --> 18:19.550
I did do that, didn't I?

18:19.807 --> 18:21.548
Good Lord, yes.

18:22.393 --> 18:23.224
I can explain.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.597
Please do.

18:24.895 --> 18:28.434
I didn't want you
to think that I would think

18:28.649 --> 18:29.890
that you were
the sort of woman

18:30.109 --> 18:31.691
who would engage in coitus

18:31.902 --> 18:34.064
simply because I cooked you
a Szechuan dinner.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.112
It was better
before you explained.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.950
All right, let me try
a different tack.

18:43.539 --> 18:44.154
Connie.

18:44.373 --> 18:45.489
Oh, boy.

18:45.916 --> 18:47.202
Would you honor me
with an evening

18:47.418 --> 18:50.001
of intimate relations?

18:51.088 --> 18:52.795
Well, that is
a different tack.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.814
This is very promising.

19:15.196 --> 19:16.403
What's happening?

19:16.656 --> 19:19.194
Dr. Sturgis's bike
is still at Meemaw's.

19:19.533 --> 19:20.319
So?

19:20.534 --> 19:22.526
That means he probably is, too.

19:23.245 --> 19:24.861
You need to get a life.

19:25.331 --> 19:26.447
There he is.

19:34.090 --> 19:36.503
Mom, Mom, Mom.

19:36.717 --> 19:37.958
- What's wrong?
- What's going on?

19:38.177 --> 19:40.760
Dr. Sturgis and Meemaw
had their first sleepover.

19:40.971 --> 19:42.883
It's a big step in
their relationship.

19:43.140 --> 19:45.223
I'm going to go
congratulate them.

19:45.768 --> 19:47.725
Hey, put on a jacket,
it's chilly out.

19:48.104 --> 19:49.094
Will do!

19:49.313 --> 19:50.804
Or try saying he can't go.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.730
Oh, never mind,
you can't go!

19:53.401 --> 19:54.733
The last thing
I heard was jacket!

19:55.611 --> 19:56.818
Oh.
