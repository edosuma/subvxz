I'm Mr. criswell.

00:08.268 --> 00:10.487

00:12.918 --> 00:14.321

Nigga, what's your problem

00:15.712 --> 00:16.943
You're a fucking phony, Malcolm.

00:16.977 --> 00:18.774
And you're
a fucking sellout, Martin.

00:18.808 --> 00:20.173
But we're still brothers

00:20.208 --> 00:22.609
and dad still needs us
to be a family.

00:22.643 --> 00:24.479
You should know that
this aggression...

00:24.513 --> 00:25.949
This aggression?
...Will no longer

00:25.984 --> 00:28.824
be tolerated by this company.

00:28.859 --> 00:29.895
Tell me something, Marty.

00:29.929 --> 00:31.970
I'm leaving the company.

00:32.003 --> 00:33.712
When?
I don't know.

have not been kind to you.

are very confusing.

Yeah.

04:43.556 --> 04:45.888

04:45.923 --> 04:48.854
Hey, asshole, take the camera while she
sucks your dick! Hold the camera, man.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.554
Yeah, be a fucking gentleman,
take the camera.

04:50.589 --> 04:52.721
You can't see the cock
going in the fucking mouth!

04:52.755 --> 04:54.188
What's the point?

04:54.222 --> 04:56.353
It was a really old camcorder
and it was very heavy,

04:56.387 --> 04:57.653
and Lonnie wasn't the strong...

04:57.687 --> 04:59.320
Why am I even explaining that
to you?

04:59.354 --> 05:01.687
Lonnie: Ow. Did you just
swallow one of his piercings?

05:01.721 --> 05:03.554
Jeannie: God, I told you not to
get something so fucking small.

05:03.588 --> 05:05.188
I'm sorry, baby.

05:05.222 --> 05:07.386
Well, how much
of it is just this?

05:07.421 --> 05:08.553
(Jeannie coughs on video)

05:08.587 --> 05:09.686

anything, just, uh...

05:17.853 --> 05:19.119
No, it's funny, you know,

05:19.154 --> 05:20.986
Jeannie was just
showing us a sex tape.

05:21.020 --> 05:23.619
Are you kidding? You're leaving
in the middle of my sex tape?

05:23.653 --> 05:25.386
Yeah, it was great,
though, good.

05:25.420 --> 05:28.897
No, oh, baby, no, no, no, it--
ugh, it was gross honestly.

05:28.931 --> 05:29.998
I, um...

05:30.032 --> 05:31.499
I have to

05:31.533 --> 05:35.502
make up an excuse to leave.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.937

look through these disclosures

06:09.790 --> 06:13.226
for U.S. national bank, but I
keep running into a firewall.

06:13.260 --> 06:14.527
Yeah, well, it's a bank, okay?

06:14.562 --> 06:16.329
They got a lot of firewalls.

06:16.364 --> 06:18.532
Yeah, but criswell
gave us the keys

06:18.566 --> 06:21.367
to the entire candy store...

06:21.402 --> 06:25.070
I mean, everything except for
what's behind this firewall.

06:25.104 --> 06:26.070
Yeah.

06:26.104 --> 06:29.071
So...

06:29.105 --> 06:31.839
So get behind the firew...
Hey, Clyde,

06:31.873 --> 06:34.040
when we touch down, could you
please help Jeannie out with this?

06:34.075 --> 06:36.075
She's got a firewall
confusing... I need help,

06:36.109 --> 06:37.509
I'm not confused.
I'm on it.

06:37.543 --> 06:38.843

06:38.877 --> 06:41.277

06:43.714 --> 06:46.681

that may, you know, derail

06:46.715 --> 06:47.782

06:47.816 --> 06:49.282
for us to do
that job effectively,

06:49.316 --> 06:50.683
we're gonna have to...
Get behind the firewall.

06:50.717 --> 06:52.684
Get behind the firewall. Yes, I was...

06:52.718 --> 06:54.618

07:05.992 --> 07:07.292

It's, it's like...

07:07.326 --> 07:09.561
Do what Sarah and I do.

07:09.595 --> 07:12.029
It's about give and
take-- very simple ethos.

07:12.064 --> 07:13.530
All right, she gives,
I take, I give, she takes.

07:13.565 --> 07:15.132
That's all it's about.

07:15.166 --> 07:17.567

you should have,

didn't... watch my sex tape.

from I.T.?

07:45.836 --> 07:47.302
Marty:
Ooh, cinda.

07:47.336 --> 07:48.936
The one with the underbite
like the Tibetan terrier?

07:48.971 --> 07:50.738
That is correct.

07:50.773 --> 07:52.443
(Slurring): She's like
this; That is correct.

07:52.477 --> 07:53.746
Turns out cinda likes me.

07:53.780 --> 07:55.454
Who cares?

07:55.488 --> 07:58.826
Go for it, Clyde, take her
on a tour of that manscape.

07:58.861 --> 08:02.463
She likes me so much, she
gave me the firewall password.

08:02.497 --> 08:03.997
Wow.

08:04.032 --> 08:06.166
What, what?
Fuck, nice work.

08:06.201 --> 08:08.501
Well, you know, if I wasn't
dating Sarah, I could have...

08:08.536 --> 08:11.471
She gave you the
firewall password?

08:11.505 --> 08:13.606
That's true love
in Tibetan terrier.

08:13.640 --> 08:14.674
(Imitates Scooby doo):
Ri rove you.

08:14.708 --> 08:17.042
Ri rove you, roo.

08:17.077 --> 08:21.446
And we are... in.

08:21.480 --> 08:23.380
Is that home loans?

08:23.415 --> 08:24.381
Oy.

08:24.415 --> 08:26.850
Jeannie:
Sub-prime loans.

08:26.885 --> 08:28.518
Super-shitty-rate loans.

08:28.552 --> 08:29.785
Ghetto loans.

08:29.820 --> 08:31.487
(Sighs)

08:31.521 --> 08:34.222
That, boys and girls,
is fucking ghetto loans.

08:34.256 --> 08:36.291
Reverse redlining.

08:36.325 --> 08:38.159
Fucking...

08:38.193 --> 08:39.160
Doug:
Yeah,

08:39.195 --> 08:40.558
sure looks like it.

08:40.592 --> 08:42.657
So white people get
pointed in one direction

08:42.691 --> 08:44.489
where they get a
decent percentage,

08:44.523 --> 08:47.157
and then, uh, black
and brown people--

08:47.191 --> 08:49.025
well, they get sent down
the hall towards...

08:49.059 --> 08:51.193
Guess what--
they get a loan, too.

08:51.228 --> 08:53.293
Yeah. And even if they
can afford a prime rate,

08:53.328 --> 08:54.393
they're automatically
booted into a ghetto loan.

08:54.427 --> 08:55.827
Doug:
Right.

08:55.862 --> 08:58.496
Then they immediately
swap out that teaser rate

08:58.530 --> 08:59.730
for a sky-high rate.

08:59.764 --> 09:01.563
And Joe black homeowner
defaults.

09:01.597 --> 09:03.295
Marty:
Right.

09:03.330 --> 09:04.896
Wow.
Yeah.

09:04.930 --> 09:09.058
Criswell must have made a mint
writing this paper.

09:10.993 --> 09:12.961
Can I have it when you're done? Yes.

09:12.995 --> 09:15.330
<i>Brynn:
You are one smart motherfucker.</i>

09:15.364 --> 09:16.998
Gives me wood.

09:17.032 --> 09:18.566
Yeah, I'm not really
that smart.

09:18.601 --> 09:20.902
I mean, me and
my team found it.

09:20.936 --> 09:23.404
But let's be honest,

09:23.438 --> 09:25.973
a chimp could have gotten
behind that bullshit firewall.

09:26.007 --> 09:27.341
Well, now you're dipping
into hyperbole.

09:27.375 --> 09:28.742
Brynn, why don't you stop

09:28.776 --> 09:31.378
fucking around and tell
me what is going on?

09:31.412 --> 09:33.146
Jesus, Marty, figure it out.

09:33.180 --> 09:34.412
You're a big boy.

09:34.446 --> 09:37.477
You wanted us to find it.

09:37.512 --> 09:40.212
Maybe. And then when we find it,

09:40.246 --> 09:43.414
you've got my black face
to sell it to the public,

09:43.449 --> 09:45.683
and you pimp me
to your racist boss

09:45.717 --> 09:47.685
to soft-sell his betrayal.

09:47.720 --> 09:48.886
Right?

09:48.921 --> 09:49.988
You're good.

09:50.022 --> 09:51.922
But don't make this personal,

09:51.957 --> 09:54.091
Marty, because it's not.
Seriously!

09:54.125 --> 09:58.262
Hey. Anybody up for a hit
of some 24-year-old scotch?

09:58.296 --> 10:00.597
And if we hadn't found it?

10:00.631 --> 10:01.731
Do the math.

10:01.766 --> 10:03.666
It's a chilly one, huh? Boy!

10:03.700 --> 10:05.935
You'd lay the whole thing
at galweather stearn's feet.

10:05.969 --> 10:08.003
Criswell: It's chilly.
(Laughs softly)

10:08.037 --> 10:09.704
Wow. That's...

10:09.738 --> 10:11.505
Yeah, nice.

10:11.540 --> 10:13.607
Criswell...

10:13.641 --> 10:15.108
Yeah?
Let loose the hounds.

10:15.142 --> 10:16.142
What?

10:17.444 --> 10:18.710
Your house nigger's

10:18.745 --> 10:21.279
making a run for it.

10:21.313 --> 10:24.081
So we walk away-- I'm
fine with that. Oh, my God,

10:24.116 --> 10:25.850
they picked right, didn't they?

10:25.884 --> 10:28.919
(Chuckles) Mr. Marty kaan--
"go along to get along."

10:28.954 --> 10:31.455
You want a shiny,
black face to help sell

10:31.489 --> 10:32.856
your tiny little genocide?

10:32.890 --> 10:34.457
Marty fuckin' kaan,
he's your man.

10:34.491 --> 10:36.692
That's right.
And maybe while we're at it,

10:36.726 --> 10:39.461
we can help this, uh, fuckin'
prep school bag of hammers

10:39.495 --> 10:41.096
get into the governor's
mansion, yeah?

10:41.130 --> 10:43.531
Why don't we whisk his ass
right into the white house,

10:43.566 --> 10:46.434
get four to eight years of
that, that'd be fuckin' awesome.

10:46.468 --> 10:49.403
Just had to sell my soul,
help galweather stearn

10:49.438 --> 10:51.872
make a shitload of money,
'cause God forbid

10:51.906 --> 10:53.874
I hang my own balls
out there, right?

10:53.908 --> 10:56.142
Do something for myself
for a fuckin' change.

10:56.176 --> 10:59.979
Sir, you want to hear a great fuckin'
story about... Marty, Marty, Marty...

11:00.013 --> 11:01.947
What am I talking about?

11:01.982 --> 11:04.716
Sell my soul-- you can't sell
something that you only rent.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.652
Right? I mean, they
got laws against that.

11:06.686 --> 11:08.253
Like, if I rented an apartment

11:08.288 --> 11:10.689
and then I tried to sell
the fuckin' thing...

11:17.461 --> 11:20.263
(Laughs softly)

11:20.297 --> 11:22.097
I'm out.

11:23.833 --> 11:26.734
You're...?
Yeah.

11:26.769 --> 11:28.469
I'm out.

11:28.504 --> 11:30.905
I'm gonna start my own shop.

11:30.939 --> 11:32.606
Wow.

11:32.641 --> 11:35.576
Fuck it.

11:35.610 --> 11:38.679
J-just like that? A done deal? Yeah.

11:38.713 --> 11:40.414
I mean, fuck it.

11:40.448 --> 11:42.449
Right? Fuck them.

11:42.483 --> 11:44.083
I think that's good.

11:44.118 --> 11:47.186
I think... I think you
should be out on your own.

11:47.220 --> 11:48.820
Yeah.

11:50.822 --> 11:52.822
(Laughs) Yeah.

11:56.993 --> 11:58.694
Are we cool?

11:58.728 --> 12:00.195
I mean, things between us,

12:00.230 --> 12:02.698
are they okay? What
are you talking about?

12:02.732 --> 12:05.100
Why wouldn't we be
cool? I... just feel...

12:05.134 --> 12:09.337
Very unsure, and things are very
chaotic, so... listen, listen.

12:09.371 --> 12:12.940
You have the world at
your feet, Jeannie bean.

12:12.975 --> 12:16.143
Okay? You hit a bump
in the road. So what?

12:16.178 --> 12:17.645
You're right back on track.

12:17.680 --> 12:20.214
(Sighs) Look...

12:20.248 --> 12:22.549
You have a great job
at galweather,

12:22.584 --> 12:26.487
and you have a better job
waiting in the wings.

12:26.521 --> 12:28.756
If you want it.

12:30.391 --> 12:33.492
And you also have porn
to fall back on.

12:33.527 --> 12:35.394
So you're good.

12:35.429 --> 12:37.229
You watched it?

12:37.264 --> 12:40.001
I didn't say I watched
it. Did you watch it?

12:40.035 --> 12:43.008
I definitely didn't want
to watch it with the idiots.

12:44.680 --> 12:46.849
And?
And if I had watched it,

12:46.883 --> 12:51.654
I might say that you
transcended the genre.

12:51.688 --> 12:56.262
I might also have to say that
my man's dick was crazy scary.

12:56.297 --> 12:59.499
(Laughs) You think
I transcended the genre?

13:01.269 --> 13:03.507
Yeah. See, that-that's
called a misdirect. (Laughs)

13:03.542 --> 13:05.946
I think you're gonna talk
about the scary dick,

13:05.980 --> 13:09.256
and you talk about the genre.
No, I want to talk about me

13:09.290 --> 13:11.792
transcending genres...
Yes.

13:11.826 --> 13:13.693
I didn't know you
could swallow so far.

13:13.728 --> 13:14.961
Ugh.

13:14.996 --> 13:16.596
(Scoffs)

13:18.565 --> 13:21.300
Hmm.

13:21.334 --> 13:23.268
So anyway, it's, uh,

13:23.303 --> 13:25.603
it's looking like
this little incident

13:25.638 --> 13:27.138
with the ghetto loans... I really don't

13:27.172 --> 13:28.906
like that term--
it doesn't include any

13:28.940 --> 13:32.476
of the subtleties or nuances
of the mortgage business.

13:32.510 --> 13:34.979
Really? Yeah, that does suck,
because there are

13:35.014 --> 13:36.383
so many nuances.

13:36.417 --> 13:39.121
Get to it, Marty.
Okay.

13:39.155 --> 13:42.824
Uh... well, I'm sure
after the firewall of Jericho

13:42.858 --> 13:45.326
came down
on these ghett-- oh...

13:45.360 --> 13:47.161
Let's call them "the things."

13:47.195 --> 13:48.829
I'm sure you're very anxious

13:48.863 --> 13:51.131
to get the genie
back in the bottle.

13:51.165 --> 13:55.301
No, uh... sunlight is

13:55.335 --> 13:57.136
the best disinfectant.
Marty: Oh, okay.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.770
Cool.

13:58.805 --> 14:00.605
So with regards to violating
the fair housing act...

14:00.640 --> 14:02.307
Fair housing act is bullshit.

14:02.341 --> 14:04.075
Uh-huh.

14:04.109 --> 14:06.978
Well, I might have to make a
call to the justice department.

14:07.012 --> 14:09.647
Of for fuck's sake, sanctimony
does not work for you.

14:09.681 --> 14:10.848
Yeah, Marty, this is...

14:10.882 --> 14:11.849
Getting absurd.

14:11.883 --> 14:13.250
I mean, m... Marty,

14:13.284 --> 14:14.852
you're supposed
to be the kind of guy

14:14.886 --> 14:16.520
that helps a brother
out of a situation,

14:16.554 --> 14:18.288
you know?
Yeah. I-I have

14:18.323 --> 14:20.657
no impetus to help you out

14:20.691 --> 14:22.025
in this situation...

14:22.059 --> 14:24.060
Brother.

14:26.497 --> 14:28.164
Well, certainly, this bank is

14:28.198 --> 14:30.165
a serious piece of
business for galweather.

14:30.200 --> 14:31.867
Yeah, for galweather.

14:31.901 --> 14:34.368
This will cement you
as julianne hofschraeger's

14:34.403 --> 14:35.469
go-to guy.

14:35.503 --> 14:37.938
Now, see, about that...

14:37.972 --> 14:39.005
Criswell:
Marty,

14:39.040 --> 14:40.773
I will give you a glowing report

14:40.808 --> 14:43.476
like this ceo has never given.
And I appreciate

14:43.510 --> 14:46.211
the potential "glowjob,"
but I have another thought.

14:46.246 --> 14:47.779
(Clears throat)

14:47.814 --> 14:50.349
Now, Carl, when you announce
your gubernatorial run,

14:50.383 --> 14:54.786
<i>i'm sure you would love to not only
look like a guy who didn't support</i>

14:54.820 --> 14:56.287
this whole
"ghetto loans" thing,

14:56.322 --> 14:59.322
but also as someone
who took a proactive part

14:59.354 --> 15:01.852
in supporting
black-owned businesses.

15:01.886 --> 15:03.619
Yeah, but I-I-I do.
Yes, of course.

15:03.654 --> 15:05.487
No, no, no, no--

15:05.522 --> 15:07.556
I do.
Well, Carl, I mean...

15:07.590 --> 15:10.825
<i>Really supporting
black-owned businesses...</i>

15:10.860 --> 15:12.827
Like mine.

15:12.861 --> 15:16.463
(Wry laugh) But galweather
is not... not galweather.

15:16.498 --> 15:18.332
Kaan & associates.

15:18.366 --> 15:19.366
Oh!

15:20.835 --> 15:22.802
Okay.

15:22.836 --> 15:24.637
Kaan & associates...

15:25.705 --> 15:27.406
Oh, my God, this fucknut

15:27.440 --> 15:30.408
might be the leader of
the free world someday.

15:32.776 --> 15:34.807
My new consultancy,

15:34.841 --> 15:35.807
Carl.

15:35.842 --> 15:37.208
My new company.

15:37.243 --> 15:39.077
You could be

15:39.111 --> 15:40.711
my first big client.

15:40.746 --> 15:43.547
Maybe even a key investor.

15:43.582 --> 15:46.583
Mr. criswell, I think
what Marty is getting at...

15:46.618 --> 15:48.585
I know what Marty
is getting at, Ms. Reed.

15:48.620 --> 15:50.655
And I think
we might be able to find

15:50.689 --> 15:52.356
some mutually beneficial
ground here.

15:53.792 --> 15:55.493
Well, there is.

15:55.527 --> 15:58.228
(Both laugh)

15:58.263 --> 16:01.431
I knew you'd show up. Welcome.

16:01.465 --> 16:05.868
Marty, I can't tell you how much
I appreciate your support during

16:05.902 --> 16:08.037
this confusing time.
And to think

16:08.071 --> 16:10.006
that some people
might see Carl criswell

16:10.040 --> 16:12.108
as a proponent of ghetto loans,

16:12.142 --> 16:13.342
or even...

16:13.376 --> 16:14.343
A racist.

16:14.377 --> 16:15.343
Oh, my God.

16:15.377 --> 16:17.578
Can you imagine?

16:17.613 --> 16:21.014
This is going to be
such a wonderful partnership.

16:21.049 --> 16:22.782
With Marty kaan at the helm,

16:22.817 --> 16:25.284
this thing's gonna
work like a dream.

16:25.319 --> 16:27.253
Actually, criswell is
technically not accountable

16:27.287 --> 16:29.287
for the mortgage policy.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.456
Yeah. Buried deep

16:31.490 --> 16:33.891
in his contracts, there's a teeny-tiny
clause about his participation

16:33.926 --> 16:36.426
in the company
being strictly advisory.

16:36.461 --> 16:38.295
He is... not responsible

16:38.329 --> 16:40.930
in any fiduciary
or legal capacities.

16:40.965 --> 16:43.099
Marty:
Do we have a fall guy?

16:43.133 --> 16:45.701
You mean beside criswell?

16:45.735 --> 16:48.937
Executive vp Henry Hughes;
He's the paper trail.

16:48.972 --> 16:51.206
Wow.
Is he a friend of yours?

16:51.240 --> 16:53.741
No one's a friend of mine
but the client.

16:53.775 --> 16:57.143
You're like me,
but with extra mean sauce.

16:57.178 --> 17:00.079
Okay, so, uh, make sure he's
not at the press conference,

17:00.113 --> 17:04.382
but that we have a couple
unflattering images of him.

17:04.415 --> 17:05.883
(Laughs)

17:05.917 --> 17:07.751
He'll take some heat
for a few weeks,

17:07.786 --> 17:09.886
but then you guys
will just parachute him

17:09.921 --> 17:11.320
right out of there, right?

17:11.355 --> 17:13.356
Already on it.

17:17.760 --> 17:19.127
(Door closes)

17:19.162 --> 17:20.994
What?

17:21.030 --> 17:22.496
You realize what
you're about to do.

17:22.531 --> 17:23.997
What am I about to do?

17:24.031 --> 17:25.799
You have been down some.

17:25.833 --> 17:28.668
This just feels...
What am I about to do?

17:28.702 --> 17:30.103
Excuse me.

17:30.137 --> 17:32.138
I was there last night, okay?

17:32.173 --> 17:34.542
I saw how you...
Hit the ground running?

17:35.610 --> 17:37.178
Huh?

17:37.212 --> 17:40.514
One of the most competitive
sectors in the world?

17:40.548 --> 17:43.617
In a time of economic
instability?

17:43.651 --> 17:47.020
All while black?

17:48.355 --> 17:50.089
That what you meant?

17:50.124 --> 17:52.958
Wow. Yeah, I guess
that's what I meant.

17:52.993 --> 17:54.026
Yeah.

17:54.060 --> 17:56.028
That's what I thought.

18:05.736 --> 18:08.804
So, naturally, when my
friend and colleague,

18:08.839 --> 18:11.940
Marty kaan, brought these...

18:11.975 --> 18:14.109
Inconsistencies to light,

18:14.144 --> 18:16.378
we saw this as an opportunity

18:16.412 --> 18:19.681
to bring about some real change
here at U.S. national.

18:19.715 --> 18:22.950
So I'm gonna hand it over
to the real expert here,

18:22.985 --> 18:24.451
Marty kaan.

18:24.486 --> 18:26.954
Marty: Thank you, Carl.
Thank you so much.

18:26.988 --> 18:28.388
Um...

18:31.592 --> 18:34.160
"Opportunity" -- that...

18:34.195 --> 18:36.229
That's a perfect word for it.

18:36.264 --> 18:38.965
So let me speak to you
a second about opportunity,

18:38.999 --> 18:41.834
opportunity and Carl criswell.

18:41.868 --> 18:44.736
Uh... I happen to have
the great pleasure

18:44.770 --> 18:47.172
of counting myself
among Carl's friends,

18:47.206 --> 18:49.407
and let me tell you
that this is a man

18:49.441 --> 18:52.176
who is not only
a great leader and a...

18:52.210 --> 18:53.977
A brilliant ceo,

18:54.011 --> 18:56.579
but he is also someone
who has his finger

18:56.614 --> 18:58.247
squarely on the pulse

18:58.281 --> 19:00.656
of gender, economic,

19:00.690 --> 19:02.859
and racial equality.

19:07.364 --> 19:12.000
His business not only lives by
a mandate of equal opportunity,

19:12.034 --> 19:15.837
but he also puts his own money
directly where his mouth is

19:15.871 --> 19:19.240
by investing in African-American
owned businesses.

19:26.948 --> 19:28.015
This is America.

19:28.049 --> 19:30.016
Because that is America.

19:30.051 --> 19:31.886
This is what we do.

19:31.921 --> 19:33.857
That is what we do.

19:36.729 --> 19:39.697
We show who we are,
not by our...

19:45.136 --> 19:48.538
We show what our principles and
ethics are, not by our words...

19:48.573 --> 19:49.973
<i>not by our words...</i>

19:51.075 --> 19:52.875
but by our actions.

19:52.910 --> 19:55.445
<i>But by our actions.</i>

19:55.479 --> 19:59.481
Not with our rhetoric
but with our wallets.

20:02.751 --> 20:04.418
S...

20:06.521 --> 20:08.121
(Clears throat)

20:23.601 --> 20:28.339
So while Carl... criswell
was not a...

20:30.208 --> 20:31.675
an active...

20:31.709 --> 20:33.243
So while Carl criswell

20:33.277 --> 20:34.811
was not an active participant

20:34.846 --> 20:36.813
in this reverse
redlining process

20:36.848 --> 20:38.481
<i>and was...</i>

20:38.516 --> 20:41.584
Busy... uh...

20:41.618 --> 20:43.652
Busy, uh...

20:43.687 --> 20:46.421
Uh, pursuing far more...

20:46.455 --> 20:48.622
Far more noble
business pursuits...

20:49.958 --> 20:52.259
he is nevertheless, once again,

20:52.294 --> 20:54.162
going to put his mouth
where his money... his...

20:54.196 --> 20:57.331
His money where his mouth is

20:57.366 --> 20:59.167
and write down these loans...

21:00.402 --> 21:01.969
administered
by a rogue operator,

21:02.003 --> 21:03.503
who will be vigorously
prosecuted.

21:05.639 --> 21:08.274
<i>How can I say this
with confidence?</i>

21:08.308 --> 21:11.477
I can this with utmost
confidence because Carl criswell

21:11.511 --> 21:13.145
gave me his word...

21:14.747 --> 21:18.783
and as all of us can attest,
and the African-American...

21:18.817 --> 21:20.051
(Weak laugh)

21:20.085 --> 21:21.719
<i>community can attest to,</i>

21:21.754 --> 21:23.321
Carl criswell's word...
...Carl's word...

21:23.355 --> 21:25.122
is his Bond.
...ls his Bond.

21:25.157 --> 21:27.391
Criswell:
Aw.

21:27.425 --> 21:28.892
Thanks, buddy.
Thank you.

21:28.926 --> 21:30.860
(Reporters clamoring)
Thank you very much.

21:33.530 --> 21:35.630
Reporter: Are you writing down
all loans, sir?

21:40.535 --> 21:42.336
<i>Clyde:
So, he took it off the site?</i>

21:42.370 --> 21:46.472
Too many negative comments
about the penis apparently.

21:46.507 --> 21:47.874
I made one
of those negative comments.

21:47.908 --> 21:49.809
I'm having nightmares.
It was disgusting.

21:49.843 --> 21:51.177
Terrifying.
And also...

21:51.211 --> 21:52.678
Probably had something
to do with the fact

21:52.713 --> 21:55.214
that I might have been 17
at the time.

21:55.249 --> 21:56.916
(Gibbering)
Oh. That changes things.

21:56.950 --> 21:58.817
Whoops. Clyde:
So basically--

21:58.852 --> 22:00.919
just so we know--
yeah.

22:00.954 --> 22:02.921
If you hadn't shown us, we
probably never would've seen it.

22:02.955 --> 22:05.257
Apparently not, no. Correct.

22:05.291 --> 22:07.392
Apparently not. That's
not such a bad thing.

22:07.426 --> 22:09.327
I, for one,
feel closer to you, Jeannie,

22:09.361 --> 22:11.362
for having seen it. I think
we all do. Right, Marty?

22:11.396 --> 22:13.563
Marty: Yeah. Goth Jeannie. I like her.

22:13.597 --> 22:15.431
Was that anything like
when you guys had sex?

22:15.465 --> 22:17.233
How many piercings does that
cock have? Totally. Yeah.

22:17.267 --> 22:19.234
Yeah.
No.

22:19.269 --> 22:20.736
Not telling us...

22:20.770 --> 22:22.270
(Sighs)

22:31.446 --> 22:33.247
You got your money, huh?

22:33.281 --> 22:34.681
Kaan & associates.

22:34.716 --> 22:37.184
What?
You got your money.

22:37.218 --> 22:39.586
Oh. Yeah. First piece. Yeah.

22:39.621 --> 22:42.222
They... well, they say
that's the hardest. (Chuckles)

22:42.256 --> 22:44.257
They lie.

22:45.593 --> 22:47.560
Marty, I'm worried about you.

22:49.129 --> 22:51.596
You're worried about me?
Mm-hmm.

22:51.630 --> 22:53.064
Are you serious?

22:53.098 --> 22:55.132
Hey...

22:55.167 --> 22:56.634
I'm king of the fucking world,
what are you...

22:56.669 --> 22:57.702
Why are you worried about me?

22:57.736 --> 23:00.537
Don't be worried.

23:00.571 --> 23:02.706
I know you're not gonna
want to listen

23:02.740 --> 23:04.274
to anything I have
to say about this...

23:04.308 --> 23:05.575
It's not gonna stop you
from talking, I'm...

23:05.609 --> 23:06.976
You can't do pretty sure.

23:07.010 --> 23:08.143
What you did today...

23:09.645 --> 23:10.745
and walk out of there

23:10.780 --> 23:11.946
like there's nothing did it.

23:11.981 --> 23:12.947
I did it.

23:12.982 --> 23:14.482
I'm still walking.

23:14.516 --> 23:18.285
Not more than
a few times, anyway.

23:20.454 --> 23:23.122
I'm the big cat, Jeannie.

23:23.156 --> 23:25.791
I got nine lives. At least.

23:28.327 --> 23:30.328
Don't worry about it.

23:40.704 --> 23:43.639
Malcolm: See, pop, if I was
stronger, like my namesake,

23:43.673 --> 23:47.309
I would be out there
every minute of every day.

23:47.343 --> 23:49.110
I'd be
on goddamn fire with my message,

23:49.144 --> 23:52.113
instead of hanging out
in bourgie-ville with y'all.

23:52.147 --> 23:57.150
Mm. No man can be on it
every minute.

23:57.184 --> 23:59.985
Well, I hold myself to
a high standard. Mm-hmm.

24:00.019 --> 24:02.087
Jeremiah:
Even your namesake...

24:02.121 --> 24:03.755
Mm! Pop,
wasn't that vigilant.

24:03.789 --> 24:05.422
Don't do it.
Aw, pop, don't do it.

24:05.457 --> 24:08.025
Don't you... start comparing me
to the big man.

24:08.059 --> 24:09.326
Well... (Chuckles)

24:09.360 --> 24:11.527
Malcolm X shabazz, I am not.

24:11.562 --> 24:13.963
Mm-mm. I disagree)

24:13.997 --> 24:16.132
I think you're exactly
like Malcolm X.

24:16.166 --> 24:17.133
Really?
Yeah.

24:17.167 --> 24:18.434
Um...

24:18.468 --> 24:21.170
Except for charisma,

24:21.205 --> 24:24.706
having faced any
real adversity and...

24:24.741 --> 24:26.275
I'm forgetting something,
what else is in there?

24:26.309 --> 24:28.676
Oh, yeah, talent. Talent.
Marty, Marty, Marty,

24:28.711 --> 24:30.178
he wasn't even talking to you.
Stop it.

24:30.212 --> 24:31.479
Talent.
No, it's all right.

24:31.513 --> 24:32.980
It's okay, pop. It's cool.

24:33.015 --> 24:35.549
You see, squirrel just
can't believe

24:35.583 --> 24:36.850
the great and powerful oz

24:36.884 --> 24:38.518
forgot to give him
a goddamn soul.

24:38.552 --> 24:43.489
Oh... oh, so you consider
"soul" spouting pseudo-radical

24:43.523 --> 24:45.457
bullshit for six hours a day

24:45.492 --> 24:48.060
in between little sorties
raiding my wine cellar.

24:48.094 --> 24:50.228
(Coughs, laughs) You hear that?

24:50.263 --> 24:52.230
He called that shit
a wine cellar.

24:52.264 --> 24:55.133
Ain't even got a decent
Bordeaux up in this bitch.

24:55.167 --> 24:56.967
Bunch of off-brand
Oregon pinots.

24:57.002 --> 24:58.535
Negro, please.
Well, you know,

24:58.570 --> 25:00.637
I'm getting ready to make a run,
so if you want

25:00.672 --> 25:02.506
to make a list,
stuff I could pick up

25:02.541 --> 25:03.874
and then...
Shove it up my ass.

25:03.909 --> 25:05.476
Stick it right up your ass. Okay, yeah.

25:05.510 --> 25:07.711
Okay, yeah. I-I can
read you, you know that?

25:07.745 --> 25:10.547
Oh, stop it. I'm just saying,
pop. You ca... you can't...

25:10.581 --> 25:13.549
Stop it. (Stammers) He started
it. He always starts it.

25:13.584 --> 25:16.552
Jeremiah: Will you be cool?
The price is right.

25:16.586 --> 25:18.721
Malcolm: (Stammers)
You and I are drinking, man.

25:18.755 --> 25:20.923
You supposed to be on my side.

25:20.957 --> 25:23.725
(Vehicles passing, horn honking,
helicopter whirring)

25:25.895 --> 25:27.862
(Sounds stop)

25:33.633 --> 25:36.635
(Sonny Terry's
"fox chase" playing)

25:59.588 --> 26:01.756
(Train clattering)

26:05.595 --> 26:07.563
(Police siren chirps)

26:07.597 --> 26:10.965
Man (Over speaker): Stop.
Attention, jogger. Please halt.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.600

26:12.634 --> 26:15.236
(Tires screeching)

26:15.271 --> 26:17.271
(Siren chirping)

26:26.180 --> 26:28.148
("Fox chase" continues;
Officer's voice indistinct)

26:32.252 --> 26:34.219
(Distant, distorted):
Take off the hood.

26:35.355 --> 26:36.855
(Distorted):
Lose the hood!

26:41.027 --> 26:42.628
("Fox chase" fades,
car horn blares)

26:42.662 --> 26:44.563
What the fuck, man?

26:44.598 --> 26:47.100
Lose the hood, sir!

26:47.134 --> 26:50.103
What's going on, fellas?
You got any I.D.?

26:50.137 --> 26:53.573
No, I don't have any I.D. I've been
jogging, man. You don't have any I.D.?

26:53.607 --> 26:57.841
No, I don't have... I've been jogging.
Put your hands above your head.

26:57.876 --> 27:01.844
Are you fucking serious, man? Put
your hands above your head now.

27:01.879 --> 27:04.247
Such bullshit.
Interlock your fingers.

27:04.281 --> 27:06.082
They are interlocked.
Smartass.

27:06.116 --> 27:08.084
Spread your legs.

27:08.118 --> 27:10.486
("Fox chase" resumes)
You got a weapon on you, huh?

27:10.521 --> 27:11.821
Fuck you.

27:11.855 --> 27:12.855

27:29.406 --> 27:31.440
Fuck you!

27:31.475 --> 27:34.209

and whooping continue)
