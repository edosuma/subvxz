<i>You're watching Channel 36's</i>

00:02.163 --> 00:04.131
<i>"Power News Live at Five."</i>

00:04.132 --> 00:05.733
<i>We've got the most
high school sports,</i>

00:05.734 --> 00:07.101
<i>the most lottery numbers,</i>

00:07.102 --> 00:08.369
<i>and the most weather</i>

00:09.804 --> 00:12.538
<i>It's news time!</i>

00:12.574 --> 00:14.108
Good evening,
I'm Brynn DeRose.

00:14.109 --> 00:15.209
And I'm Slade Austin.

00:15.210 --> 00:16.309
Tonight on "Power News,"

00:16.311 --> 00:17.745
we reveal who Donald Trump

00:17.746 --> 00:19.380
is running against
for President.

00:19.381 --> 00:22.149
Plus, we'll show you
the winning lottery numbers.

00:22.150 --> 00:24.652
Could 67 be one of them?

00:24.653 --> 00:26.620
Two prisoners have escaped

00:26.621 --> 00:28.188
from the Coral Palms
sheriff's station

00:28.189 --> 00:30.224
in a daring daylight jailbreak.

00:30.225 --> 00:32.092
<i>The men, identified
as Gregory Stickney</i>

00:32.093 --> 00:33.327
<i>and Larry Sherbert</i>

00:33.328 --> 00:34.995
<i>were arrested after
a routine traffic stop</i>

00:34.996 --> 00:37.298
revealed a cache
of automatic weapons.

00:37.299 --> 00:39.533
Less than 12 hours later,
the men escaped

00:39.534 --> 00:42.069
by creating a disturbance
in their cell.

00:42.070 --> 00:43.270
Well, they started kissing,

00:43.271 --> 00:44.438
which I'm fine with...

00:44.439 --> 00:47.174
really, I am,
kiss whoever you want...

00:47.175 --> 00:48.943
except they were both men.

00:48.944 --> 00:51.612
Tito Amendola was also
in holding at the time

00:51.613 --> 00:53.047
and witnessed the jailbreak.

00:53.048 --> 00:56.250
I do a lot of meth.

00:56.251 --> 00:58.786
The sheriff's office is
coordinating their search

00:58.787 --> 01:00.854
with local and state police.

01:00.855 --> 01:02.323
If you're watching,
Greg and Larry,

01:02.324 --> 01:03.390
and I know you are,

01:03.391 --> 01:04.992
my men and I will not rest

01:04.992 --> 01:06.660
until we find you.

01:06.661 --> 01:07.695
That's right,

01:07.696 --> 01:09.163
we're coming for you.

01:09.164 --> 01:11.298
Strong words, and moving on,

01:11.299 --> 01:13.867
what if you were going
through a drive-thru,

01:13.868 --> 01:16.657
and a puppy dog
took your order?

01:42.097 --> 01:43.831
The cops are looking for us,

01:43.832 --> 01:45.065
and a madman wants us dead.

01:45.066 --> 01:47.534
We should be laying low
until the Nine-Nine gets here.

01:47.535 --> 01:49.336
Yeah, but we don't know
when that's gonna be,

01:49.337 --> 01:50.771
and we need food and supplies.

01:50.772 --> 01:52.806
Okay, I'll get some water.

01:52.807 --> 01:55.576
Holt, are you trying
to draw attention to us?

01:55.577 --> 01:57.111
Nobody drinks water here.

01:57.112 --> 01:58.679
Choose something blue or green.

01:58.680 --> 02:00.547
Okay, I guess
I'll go in for, uh,

02:00.548 --> 02:03.650
the Blazing Blue Rad-berry
Cooler Xtreme: Code Rad.

02:03.651 --> 02:04.752
Good choice.

02:04.753 --> 02:07.021
I should probably get
some body spray as well.

02:07.022 --> 02:09.423
What sounds better,
Liquid Moan or Turnpike?

02:09.424 --> 02:11.091
We only have $17 to our name.

02:11.092 --> 02:12.526
We can't spend five
of it on this.

02:12.527 --> 02:14.128
I know, but I'm about to see
Amy for the first time

02:14.129 --> 02:15.729
in forever, and I want
to smell like a...

02:15.730 --> 02:18.165
"hot New Jersey breeze," ugh.

02:18.166 --> 02:19.265
Good call.

02:19.300 --> 02:21.602
All right, let's get
out of here.

02:21.603 --> 02:23.536
<i>And in Coral Palms,
law enforcement</i>

02:23.571 --> 02:25.439
<i>still is searching
for a pair of fugitives</i>

02:25.440 --> 02:27.741
<i>who broke out of jail
earlier this evening.</i>

02:27.742 --> 02:29.076
<i>Greg Stickney
and Larry Sherbert</i>

02:29.077 --> 02:30.511
<i>are believed to be
unarmed but dangerous.</i>

02:30.512 --> 02:32.613
Liquid Moan, nice.

02:32.614 --> 02:35.015
I wore this to Swampsgiving
last year... cleaned up.

02:35.016 --> 02:36.183
Right on, bro.

02:36.184 --> 02:38.085
Oh, we have a promotion
on the Code Rad.

02:38.086 --> 02:39.386
- It comes with a free cigarette.
- Oh, no.

02:39.387 --> 02:40.721
That doesn't matter.
We don't need it.

02:40.722 --> 02:41.855
Well, if you don't want it,
I'll take it.

02:41.856 --> 02:43.290
No, no, no.
Don't do that... smoking is bad.

02:43.291 --> 02:44.291
You should quit smoking
right now.

02:44.292 --> 02:45.492
Hey...

02:54.602 --> 02:56.970
Ahh.

02:56.971 --> 02:58.439
We seem to be in the clear.

02:58.440 --> 02:59.706
- Are you hurt?
- Yeah.

02:59.707 --> 03:01.275
I got caught on top
of the fence.

03:01.276 --> 03:03.510
Check out my calf...
it's like Scratch City.

03:03.511 --> 03:04.745
How about you?

03:04.746 --> 03:07.581
I'm fine, except I was impaled
on a metal pipe.

03:07.582 --> 03:09.917
Oh, my God!

03:11.686 --> 03:13.647
Oh, my God!

03:15.450 --> 03:17.124
It's gonna be fine.

03:17.125 --> 03:18.826
Oh, my God!

03:18.827 --> 03:20.961
I got rifles, vests,
flash grenades...

03:20.962 --> 03:23.997
Chips, dips,
ice cream sammies...

03:23.998 --> 03:25.732
I'm pretty sure there's gonna
be snacks in Florida, Scully.

03:25.733 --> 03:27.233
Pretty sure?

03:27.268 --> 03:29.636
Do you arrest someone if you're
pretty sure they're guilty?

03:29.637 --> 03:31.472
No, Amy,
you wait till you get all the facts!

03:31.473 --> 03:34.141
Hey, okay, everyone,
let's just try to bring things

03:34.142 --> 03:35.642
we actually need
for the mission.

03:35.643 --> 03:38.912
Really?
Then what is this?

03:38.913 --> 03:41.715
Oh, it's a book of 4,000
essential photos of Nikolaj

03:41.716 --> 03:42.883
for me to show Jake.

03:42.884 --> 03:44.551
All right, bad news.

03:44.552 --> 03:45.986
I talked to
Captain Stentley again.

03:45.987 --> 03:48.088
He still won't give us
permission to go to Florida.

03:48.089 --> 03:49.823
I even brought out the big guns.

03:49.824 --> 03:51.859
Left, right, left, right,

03:51.860 --> 03:53.260
both, both, both.

03:53.261 --> 03:55.729
That's so cool!

03:55.730 --> 03:57.698
I still can't let you
go to Florida, though.

03:57.699 --> 03:59.166
Terry feels like a whore.

03:59.167 --> 04:02.002
He said if we disobey him,
there'll be tire consequences.

04:02.003 --> 04:03.737
I think he meant dire.

04:03.738 --> 04:04.938
Guy's real dumb.

04:04.939 --> 04:06.106
Who's with me?

04:06.107 --> 04:08.275
Great, Hitchcock's in.
Who else?

04:08.276 --> 04:09.643
I actually had a question.

04:09.644 --> 04:11.311
How mad would everyone be
if I just bailed?

04:11.312 --> 04:13.747
Shut up, Hitchcock.
Obviously, we're all going.

04:13.748 --> 04:16.216
What's up, squadron?

04:16.216 --> 04:18.652
I'm airplane ready,
and I'm T-minus 30

04:18.653 --> 04:19.853
from my Ambies kicking in,

04:19.853 --> 04:22.756
so let's take it
to the skies.

04:22.757 --> 04:24.358
Yeah, about that.

04:24.359 --> 04:26.994
Um, there were no tickets left.

04:26.995 --> 04:28.862
But I brought my minivan, so...

04:28.863 --> 04:30.696
Road trip!

04:34.769 --> 04:36.170
I went to a 24-hour vet

04:36.171 --> 04:37.905
and got surgical supplies.

04:37.906 --> 04:39.806
I was in and out like a ninja.

04:39.807 --> 04:41.208
Needles, needles, need...

04:41.209 --> 04:42.342
whoa!

04:45.113 --> 04:46.413
So many dogs!

04:46.414 --> 04:47.948
I'll need your assistance.

04:47.949 --> 04:50.117
You'll have to pull out the pipe
and stitch up the wound.

04:50.118 --> 04:52.152
All right.
This is gonna hurt.

04:52.153 --> 04:53.520
But I'm gonna get you
through it.

04:53.521 --> 04:56.123
Oh, God, I'm gonna throw
up into your cut.

04:56.124 --> 04:57.424
Ahhh, I saw inside of you.

04:57.425 --> 04:58.892
How are humans alive?

04:58.893 --> 05:00.894
Okay, uh, I'll do the surgery,

05:00.895 --> 05:02.963
and, uh, you just breathe, okay?

05:02.964 --> 05:04.031
We'll get you through this.

05:04.032 --> 05:06.065
Okay.

05:07.101 --> 05:08.702
Ugh, what was that sound?

05:08.703 --> 05:10.237
I did not like
that squish sound.

05:10.238 --> 05:12.506
The pipe has been removed.

05:12.507 --> 05:15.175
Now...

05:15.176 --> 05:17.344
I'm sewing myself up.

05:17.345 --> 05:19.146
Okay, this is almost over.

05:19.147 --> 05:20.614
You're doing great.

05:20.615 --> 05:21.848
Just keep talking.
Keep talking.

05:21.849 --> 05:22.849
Talking about what?

05:22.850 --> 05:25.519
Uh, tell me about Amy, hmm?

05:25.520 --> 05:26.753
You must be excited to see her.

05:26.754 --> 05:27.854
Very much, you know.

05:27.855 --> 05:29.389
Oh, God, what if it
doesn't go well?

05:29.390 --> 05:30.757
We haven't seen each other
in a while,

05:30.758 --> 05:32.226
and what if it's weird?

05:32.227 --> 05:34.161
- Uhhh!
- Keep going, keep going.

05:34.162 --> 05:36.463
You're doing so well.
Why would it be weird?

05:36.464 --> 05:37.564
I don't know.
I don't know.

05:37.565 --> 05:38.932
I mean, maybe we've grown apart.

05:38.933 --> 05:40.701
Maybe she'll be repulsed
by my frosted tips.

05:40.702 --> 05:42.803
I was gonna defrost them before
I saw her for the first time.

05:42.804 --> 05:45.672
I'm sure it will be magical
when you see her.

05:45.673 --> 05:47.007
And...

05:47.008 --> 05:48.008
guess what?

05:48.009 --> 05:49.009
- What?
- I'm done.

05:49.010 --> 05:50.978
I've sewn myself up.

05:50.979 --> 05:52.713
- Huh.
- You did great, buddy.

05:52.714 --> 05:54.281
I'm proud of you.

05:54.282 --> 05:56.383
I can't believe I did it.

05:56.384 --> 05:57.818
I'm so strong.

05:57.819 --> 05:59.653
Ooh, we're crossing
into Virginia.

05:59.654 --> 06:02.256
Virginia is not
technically a state,

06:02.257 --> 06:03.356
but a commonwealth.

06:03.391 --> 06:04.391
Oof, poor Jake.

06:04.392 --> 06:06.293
Uhh, this might be
the Ambies speaking,

06:06.294 --> 06:08.729
but this in-flight movie sucks.

06:08.730 --> 06:10.964
So, uh, you already
moved the twins

06:10.965 --> 06:12.699
onto a booster seat, huh?

06:12.700 --> 06:13.734
Aren't they a little
young for that?

06:13.735 --> 06:14.735
They're four.

06:14.736 --> 06:15.902
Nikolaj is four,

06:15.903 --> 06:17.170
but we're sticking
with the car seat

06:17.171 --> 06:19.139
as long as possible,
but you know me...

06:19.140 --> 06:20.540
I'm a "safety at all costs"
kind of dad.

06:20.541 --> 06:21.541
Mm-hmm.

06:21.542 --> 06:22.843
Sarge, I need to go
to the bathroom.

06:22.844 --> 06:24.244
We just stopped for gas.

06:24.245 --> 06:25.245
I asked you if you had to go.

06:25.246 --> 06:26.413
I didn't have to then.

06:26.414 --> 06:29.049
So does this van have
side-impact airbags?

06:29.050 --> 06:30.083
Not in the back.

06:30.084 --> 06:31.585
Oh. Interesting.

06:31.586 --> 06:32.786
No judgment here.

06:32.787 --> 06:34.221
Sarge, I have to pee now too.

06:34.222 --> 06:36.390
Seriously?
You, Diaz?

06:36.391 --> 06:38.458
Look, I'll turn off
at the next exit, okay?

06:38.459 --> 06:39.626
I have to pee really badly.

06:39.627 --> 06:40.961
Hot.

06:40.962 --> 06:42.262
- What?
- Hitchcock!

06:42.263 --> 06:43.697
- Guys, enough!
- Sarge...

06:43.698 --> 06:45.299
Yeah, I know!
You got to pee, I got it!

06:45.300 --> 06:46.800
- No, brake lights!
- Oh, crap.

06:46.801 --> 06:48.635
Everyone hang on!
There's no side-impact airbags!

06:51.873 --> 06:52.939
Did you get breakfast?

06:52.940 --> 06:55.776
I tried, but I got recognized.

06:55.777 --> 06:57.811
Do I know you from somewhere?

06:57.812 --> 07:00.013
Do you watch a lot
of pornography?

07:00.014 --> 07:02.382
'Cause I'm in most of it.

07:02.383 --> 07:04.685
Oh, boy.
What if you were followed?

07:04.686 --> 07:06.053
I don't think it's safe
to stay here.

07:06.054 --> 07:07.054
Where are we gonna go?

07:09.023 --> 07:10.557
- The cops?
- Or Figgis!

07:10.558 --> 07:11.624
Do we have any weapons?

07:11.659 --> 07:12.893
I have the pipe
we pulled out of me.

07:12.894 --> 07:15.128
I would sooner surrender
than go anywhere near

07:15.129 --> 07:16.530
your gooey body pipe.

07:16.531 --> 07:18.932
Oh, no, I'm gonna do it.

07:20.768 --> 07:22.869
- Oh!
- Jake?

07:22.870 --> 07:24.304
Amy...

07:24.305 --> 07:25.539
It's so good to see you.

07:29.579 --> 07:31.410
Thank you guys
so much for coming.

07:31.411 --> 07:32.777
I can't wait to catch up
with all of you

07:32.778 --> 07:33.777
when this is done.

07:33.779 --> 07:34.912
My dad died, and...

07:34.913 --> 07:36.547
Again, when this is done,
Hitchcock.

07:36.548 --> 07:38.082
Gina, you look like
a fresh wizard,

07:38.083 --> 07:39.250
and I love it.

07:39.251 --> 07:41.252
So we know that Figgis
is in Coral Palms,

07:41.253 --> 07:42.620
but we don't know where he is,

07:42.621 --> 07:44.522
and we don't know how many
guys he's got with him.

07:44.523 --> 07:46.991
The plan is to lure them into
the Fun Zone and ambush them.

07:46.992 --> 07:49.193
- Any questions?
- Yes, did you miss us?

07:49.194 --> 07:51.095
Did you ever
look up at the moon

07:51.096 --> 07:53.063
and wonder if I was
looking at it too?

07:53.064 --> 07:54.565
- Yes.
- Knew it.

07:54.566 --> 07:56.233
All right, once we get
to the Fun Zone,

07:56.234 --> 07:58.102
I'll fill everyone in
on the mission details.

07:58.103 --> 07:59.402
You guys come with me.

07:59.437 --> 08:00.971
Captain, you stay here and rest.

08:00.972 --> 08:02.940
What?
I don't need to rest.

08:02.941 --> 08:04.471
I'm in peak condition.

08:04.472 --> 08:05.505
All right, then stand up.

08:05.506 --> 08:06.505
Easy.

08:11.712 --> 08:12.946
I love standing up.

08:12.980 --> 08:14.046
Yeah, you're staying here.

08:14.081 --> 08:16.416
Aw, Captain,
don't worry, okay?

08:16.417 --> 08:18.751
My sleeping pills
are doing their job,

08:18.786 --> 08:21.720
and I can stay here
and take care of you, okay?

08:21.756 --> 08:23.422
Terry, I'm gonna
need your gun.

08:23.457 --> 08:24.457
That's not happening.

08:24.458 --> 08:26.026
All right, I'll use my own.

08:26.027 --> 08:27.594
Oops-a-daisy.

08:27.595 --> 08:29.595
That is adorable.
Where did you get that?

08:29.630 --> 08:31.298
Vending machine
at a rest stop.

08:31.299 --> 08:34.100
Give me that.
Just don't let Captain Holt die.

08:34.101 --> 08:36.602
And stay on your phone for
logistical support as planned.

08:36.604 --> 08:37.971
Now come on, guys,
let's get ready.

08:40.274 --> 08:43.643
Hey, we never really
got a chance to say hi.

08:43.644 --> 08:45.312
Yeah. Hi.

08:45.313 --> 08:46.713
Hi.

08:46.714 --> 08:48.481
Oh, my God, everyone,

08:48.482 --> 08:49.616
Jake and Amy are going to kiss

08:49.617 --> 08:51.250
for the first time
in six months.

08:51.285 --> 08:53.252
Let those Nicholas Sparks fly.

08:53.287 --> 08:55.689
So everyone's just
gonna watch us?

08:55.690 --> 08:57.756
Yes!
Now get to it, you lovebirds.

09:00.094 --> 09:01.461
Here we go.

09:01.462 --> 09:02.495
Come on, man.

09:02.496 --> 09:03.897
How did you get there so fast?

09:03.898 --> 09:05.966
- Love finds a way.
- Ugh.

09:05.967 --> 09:08.000
Welcome to the Fun Zone.

09:08.035 --> 09:09.869
I know the manager, and he's
agreed to shut the place down

09:09.870 --> 09:11.938
for the day, so there won't
be any civilians around.

09:11.939 --> 09:12.939
Smart.

09:12.940 --> 09:14.107
You put up all these fake signs

09:14.108 --> 09:15.475
about a major
health code violation.

09:15.476 --> 09:16.943
No, those are actually
always there...

09:16.944 --> 09:19.212
something about lead being in
the air and water and ground.

09:19.213 --> 09:20.847
Anyways, you all have
your assignments.

09:20.881 --> 09:22.282
Let's plan an ambush.

09:22.283 --> 09:24.784
Nine-Nine! NineNine!

09:24.785 --> 09:25.852
Chills, you guys.

09:25.853 --> 09:28.154
Literally, chills.

09:29.557 --> 09:30.957
Hey there, Nikolaj.

09:30.958 --> 09:31.957
It's your papa.

09:31.993 --> 09:33.293
If you're watching this,

09:33.294 --> 09:34.861
something bad has
happened to me.

09:34.862 --> 09:37.964
But I want you to know
that I love you very much.

09:37.965 --> 09:40.300
You want to stop filming
yourself and help me with

09:40.301 --> 09:41.633
these many items I'm carrying?

09:41.669 --> 09:44.270
Sorry, I was making
a video for my son.

09:44.271 --> 09:46.773
You know, in case
I never see him again.

09:46.774 --> 09:49.209
Do you not do that
for your kids?

09:49.210 --> 09:50.510
Of course I do.

09:50.511 --> 09:53.078
I make those kind of videos
all the time.

09:53.114 --> 09:56.449
You know, in fact, I was about
to do one right now.

09:56.450 --> 09:58.284
Hey... hey, girls.

09:58.285 --> 09:59.652
It's me, Daddy.

09:59.653 --> 10:02.055
If you're seeing this,
I'm dead.

10:02.056 --> 10:05.792
But I want you to know
that I love you now and forever.

10:05.793 --> 10:08.527
Okay, time for a lullaby,
sung in your native Latvian.

10:08.562 --> 10:10.696
Ligo! Ligo! Ligo!

10:10.731 --> 10:12.599
Yeah, yeah, lullaby time.
Look.

10:12.600 --> 10:15.535
<i>Go to sleep, Daddy's dead</i>

10:15.536 --> 10:19.038
<i>But his ghost's
always watching</i>

10:19.073 --> 10:20.615
What the hell are
you guys doing?

10:22.476 --> 10:24.044
Good call.
Blocking the door.

10:24.045 --> 10:25.378
Keep it up, smorty-pants.

10:25.379 --> 10:26.446
- Oh...
- Uh...

10:26.447 --> 10:28.081
Mwah.

10:28.082 --> 10:29.549
One of our classic
forehead smooches,

10:29.550 --> 10:30.549
just like I planned.

10:32.470 --> 10:33.686
- This is weird.
- Should we have sex?

10:33.687 --> 10:34.687
- What?
- Huh?

10:34.688 --> 10:35.755
Yeah.
I mean, no.

10:35.756 --> 10:36.756
No, things aren't weird,

10:36.757 --> 10:37.857
or no to the sex?

10:37.858 --> 10:39.492
- Maybe we should just...
- You're right.

10:39.493 --> 10:41.995
Just concentrate on Figgis,
and we'll figure this out later.

10:41.996 --> 10:43.897
No, I was gonna say
maybe we should talk,

10:43.898 --> 10:45.932
but yeah, it can wait
till after Figgis.

10:45.933 --> 10:46.933
Ah.

10:46.934 --> 10:48.435
We have the rest
of our lives to talk.

10:48.436 --> 10:49.869
Yeah, unless he
kills us first.

10:49.870 --> 10:51.604
What a weird joke.

10:51.605 --> 10:52.872
Regret saying that one.

10:52.873 --> 10:54.774
Wow, things are clickin'.

10:56.510 --> 10:58.144
I'm gonna go make sure

10:58.145 --> 11:00.405
there's enough balls in...
in the ball pit.

11:00.414 --> 11:01.581
Yup.

11:01.582 --> 11:04.317
Important to get on them balls.

11:04.318 --> 11:06.552
What is wrong with me?

11:06.587 --> 11:08.288
So then Trevor sends me
a text, and he's like,

11:08.289 --> 11:10.190
"At this point, I hate you."

11:10.191 --> 11:11.558
I'm like, "Oh, really?

11:11.559 --> 11:13.058
'Cause you didn't
hate me last week."

11:13.094 --> 11:14.594
Trevor sounds like a dog.

11:14.595 --> 11:17.130
Right?
God, I missed our daily dishes.

11:17.131 --> 11:18.131
Me too.

11:18.132 --> 11:19.365
I'm sorry I'm not
reciprocating

11:19.366 --> 11:20.467
with "hot goss" of my own.

11:20.468 --> 11:21.868
I'm just worried
about the Nine-Nine.

11:21.869 --> 11:23.602
Sir, they're gonna be fine.

11:23.637 --> 11:24.637
They're my squad.

11:24.638 --> 11:26.573
I should be there with them.

11:26.574 --> 11:28.842
This is killing me.

11:28.843 --> 11:31.544
Well, I'm not gonna let it.

11:31.545 --> 11:32.712
Let's go.

11:32.713 --> 11:34.080
But my wound, Gina.

11:34.081 --> 11:36.483
Sir, with your brain
and my body...

11:36.484 --> 11:38.017
and my brain...

11:38.018 --> 11:40.361
we make one unstoppable unit.

11:40.387 --> 11:42.222
Now climb aboard, sir.

11:44.458 --> 11:46.759
And let's go.

11:47.928 --> 11:48.927
Oof.

11:50.364 --> 11:52.373
All right, everybody ready?

11:52.399 --> 11:54.801
Good.
Let's set this trap.

12:02.643 --> 12:03.676
Hello.

12:03.711 --> 12:06.145
- Hello, Figgis.
- <i>Peralta.</i>

12:06.180 --> 12:08.715
Congratulations
on escaping prison.

12:08.716 --> 12:11.017
Thank you.
Congrats on sucking.

12:11.051 --> 12:12.552
You know, I'm bored.

12:12.553 --> 12:14.354
I'd love to kill you tonight.

12:14.355 --> 12:15.821
So where you hiding?

12:15.856 --> 12:17.257
Wouldn't you like you know?

12:17.258 --> 12:18.900
<i>Round one.</i>

12:18.926 --> 12:20.693
You're never gonna find me.

12:20.728 --> 12:22.262
<i>I'm invisible.</i>

12:22.263 --> 12:25.098
Mommy, I won!
I won a big pwize!

12:25.099 --> 12:26.533
<i>Downtown!</i>

12:26.534 --> 12:29.334
I'm everywhere,
and I'm nowhere.

12:29.370 --> 12:31.037
<i>And I'm coming for you.</i>

12:31.071 --> 12:33.305
Peace out, loser.

12:33.340 --> 12:37.110
He's at the Fun Zone.
Gear up.

12:37.111 --> 12:39.512
This ends tonight.

12:39.513 --> 12:40.613
Uh!

12:40.614 --> 12:42.515
- Ow!
- Oh, sorry, babe.

12:42.516 --> 12:44.272
What were you aiming for?

12:47.686 --> 12:51.155
Hey, got you a bag
of Blue Rad-berry slushie

12:51.156 --> 12:52.423
for the swelling.

12:52.424 --> 12:53.524
I would've just gotten ice,

12:53.525 --> 12:56.127
but a possum died
in the ice machine.

12:56.128 --> 12:57.595
- Cool.
- Yeah.

12:57.596 --> 12:59.196
Why do we keep
hurting each other?

12:59.231 --> 13:00.431
I don't know.

13:00.432 --> 13:01.465
Maybe I'm overthinking it.

13:01.466 --> 13:02.500
It just feels like we're not...

13:02.501 --> 13:03.634
- On the same page.
- Clicking.

13:03.635 --> 13:05.035
That was basically
the same thing.

13:05.070 --> 13:06.204
- I count that.
- Yeah.

13:06.205 --> 13:08.039
Look, I know this
isn't the right time

13:08.040 --> 13:11.074
for some big talk,
but I just...

13:11.109 --> 13:12.609
want us to be normal again.

13:12.644 --> 13:15.513
Yeah, me too.

13:15.514 --> 13:17.048
I hope you're a better
kisser than Holt.

13:17.049 --> 13:18.882
- What?
- Why did I say that?

13:18.917 --> 13:20.184
Why did you kiss Holt?

13:20.185 --> 13:21.786
I didn't. I did.

13:21.787 --> 13:23.520
We did it to get out of jail,

13:23.555 --> 13:24.722
but it didn't mean anything.

13:24.723 --> 13:26.524
Just forget I said
anything, right?

13:26.525 --> 13:29.560
Rewind.

13:29.561 --> 13:31.729
- And kiss.
- Jake...

13:31.730 --> 13:32.730
You want to know
if there was tongue.

13:32.731 --> 13:33.998
I can tell you,
decidedly there was not.

13:33.999 --> 13:36.266
No, Jake.
Figgis is here.

13:37.669 --> 13:39.436
Okay, well, good talk.
Don't die.

13:39.471 --> 13:40.471
Holt had very soft lips.

13:40.472 --> 13:41.672
Wish I hadn't said
that one either.

13:41.673 --> 13:42.673
- We should get into positions.
- Yeah, okay.

13:42.674 --> 13:44.575
Hey, kill the lights!
Figgis is here!

13:50.315 --> 13:52.616
Excuse me, ma'am,
this dolly's being used.

13:52.651 --> 13:54.051
<i>Broccoli Che visto?</i>

13:54.052 --> 13:55.820
It's being used.

13:55.821 --> 13:56.954
<i>Quanti erala Vito la Bella?</i>

13:56.955 --> 13:58.956
<i>Tutto matro lamente?</i>

13:58.957 --> 14:00.877
Just bring it back
when you're done.

14:00.893 --> 14:03.254
<i>Ah! Garbanzo marinara!</i>

14:03.262 --> 14:04.896
<i>Pizzería restaurante!</i>

14:04.897 --> 14:06.257
<i>Ahh!</i>

14:09.562 --> 14:11.868
Jackpot.
Let's do this.

14:11.904 --> 14:14.105
And how am I supposed
to get all the way up there?

14:14.106 --> 14:15.405
Gracefully.

14:15.440 --> 14:17.408
- Boost my bottom!
- I'm boosting!

14:17.409 --> 14:19.443
Boost my bottom!

14:19.444 --> 14:20.945
I'm boosting!

14:20.946 --> 14:23.214
Boost it!

14:23.215 --> 14:25.182
Ah. All right...

14:25.183 --> 14:26.784
stick shift.

14:26.785 --> 14:28.586
I can't drive stick shift.

14:28.587 --> 14:29.854
You're gonna have to drive.

14:29.855 --> 14:31.454
How? My leg doesn't work.

14:31.490 --> 14:34.158
Sir, I am a dancer.

14:34.159 --> 14:36.259
I will be your legs.

14:36.295 --> 14:37.328
Clutch in.

14:37.329 --> 14:39.329
- Okay.
- Clutch out.

14:39.364 --> 14:41.165
- Oh!
- Hoo-hoo!

14:41.166 --> 14:44.268
<i>We are the best driver
in the world!</i>

14:50.208 --> 14:51.542
Spread out and find 'em.

14:57.182 --> 15:00.150
Bogie headed to the ball pit.

15:00.185 --> 15:02.520
<i>Is that all you got?
I'll take your best shot</i>

15:02.521 --> 15:05.022
<i>I'll take your best shot,
I'll take your best shot!</i>

15:05.023 --> 15:06.357
<i>Boom <i> - <i>Here comes the.</i></i></i>

15:06.358 --> 15:08.259
<i>Boom <i> - <i>Ready or not.</i></i></i>

15:08.260 --> 15:10.694
<i>Here comes the boys
from the South</i>

15:10.729 --> 15:12.596
<i>- <i>Is that all you got? <i>
- <i>I'll take your best shot.</i></i></i></i>

15:12.597 --> 15:14.432
<i>- <i>Well, it's all right <i>
- <i>I'll take your best shot</i></i></i></i>

15:14.433 --> 15:16.067
<i>- <i>I'll take your best shot <i>
- <i>Boom.</i></i></i></i>

15:16.068 --> 15:17.535
<i>Here comes the <i> - <i>Boom.</i></i></i>

15:17.536 --> 15:20.638
<i>Ready or not,
ha ha, how you like me now?</i>

15:20.639 --> 15:22.672
Peralta...

15:22.708 --> 15:24.375
Holt.

15:24.376 --> 15:27.144
I know you're here.

15:27.145 --> 15:30.214
I'm gonna kill you.

15:30.215 --> 15:32.316
- I don't think so.
- Oh...

15:32.317 --> 15:35.386
Put down the weapon, Figgis.

15:35.387 --> 15:36.787
There you go.

15:36.788 --> 15:38.556
Oh, yes.

15:38.557 --> 15:41.759
I've been waiting for this
moment a long time.

15:41.760 --> 15:43.761
You ruined my life.

15:43.762 --> 15:45.895
I had to live in Florida
for six months!

15:45.931 --> 15:47.331
It's the worst.

15:47.332 --> 15:48.832
Have you tried
the pizza down here?

15:48.867 --> 15:50.835
Yeah, it's the most disgusting
thing I've ever tasted.

15:50.836 --> 15:53.037
It somehow burned my mouth
and is cold at the same time.

15:53.038 --> 15:54.505
But none of that changes
the fact that you're about

15:54.506 --> 15:56.040
to go to prison for
the rest of your life.

15:56.041 --> 15:57.508
Drop it, Sherbert!

15:57.509 --> 15:59.143
What? No!

15:59.144 --> 16:02.013
I've been everywhere,
and I finally spotted your minivan

16:02.014 --> 16:04.248
with the New York plates
parked around back.

16:04.249 --> 16:07.118
We already got all your friends.
So drop it.

16:07.119 --> 16:09.353
You don't understand.
I'm a detective with the NYPD.

16:09.354 --> 16:11.589
This is Jimmy Figgis;
he's wanted by the FBI.

16:11.590 --> 16:13.890
No, I'm Constantine Binvoglio,

16:13.925 --> 16:16.260
and I came here to repair
a skee ball machine

16:16.261 --> 16:18.162
on the the fritz, but suddenly
he's trying to kill me.

16:18.163 --> 16:20.998
He's lying.
"Constantine Binvoglio."

16:20.999 --> 16:22.566
It's clearly a name
he just made up.

16:22.567 --> 16:23.834
I'm very impressed.
That was pretty good.

16:23.835 --> 16:25.135
I will shoot you, Sherbert.

16:25.170 --> 16:27.605
All right, fine,
I will put down my weapon,

16:27.606 --> 16:30.207
but you have to promise me
you will not let this man go.

16:36.081 --> 16:38.682
Okay, well, we're gonna
cuff everyone,

16:38.683 --> 16:40.718
and then we're gonna
sort this all out.

16:40.719 --> 16:43.387
- Thank you.
- Yeah, thanks, Sheriff.

16:44.823 --> 16:46.357
No!

16:46.358 --> 16:48.892
Now let's me and you
take a little walk.

16:50.395 --> 16:51.461
Ooh.

16:54.508 --> 16:56.042
How do you think you're
getting out of this, Figgis?

16:56.043 --> 16:57.310
Do you even have a plan?

16:57.311 --> 16:59.612
I'm gonna hold you hostage
to get away.

16:59.613 --> 17:01.047
Then I'm gonna drive
to a gas station

17:01.048 --> 17:02.281
where I'll steal a clean car

17:02.282 --> 17:03.449
and head for the airport,

17:03.450 --> 17:05.251
where I'll buy a ticket
with my false ID,

17:05.252 --> 17:06.786
then kill you in the parking lot

17:06.787 --> 17:08.421
and disappear again.

17:08.422 --> 17:09.856
Pfft.

17:09.857 --> 17:11.356
You're scrambling.

17:13.993 --> 17:16.596
Look, I told you, we're NYPD.

17:16.597 --> 17:18.631
- Yeah, right.
- I can prove it.

17:18.632 --> 17:20.900
Look up "Brooklyn detective
attacked by birds."

17:20.901 --> 17:22.868
You'll see an article
with a photo of me.

17:22.869 --> 17:23.836
<i>Officer down.</i>

17:23.837 --> 17:25.371
<i>All available units respond.</i>

17:25.372 --> 17:27.006
I'm gonna give you a window,
and you're gonna go after Jake.

17:27.007 --> 17:29.808
My name is Detective
Rosa Diaz, NYPD.

17:29.843 --> 17:32.945
- Get back.
- I'm reaching for my badge.

17:38.270 --> 17:40.953
Keep walking.

17:40.954 --> 17:42.655
Let him go.

17:42.656 --> 17:44.490
Put that gun down, or he dies.

17:44.491 --> 17:45.691
He's not gonna shoot me.

17:45.692 --> 17:46.993
He needs me alive
to get out of here.

17:46.994 --> 17:48.461
Yeah, you willing
to take that bet?

17:48.462 --> 17:49.829
I wouldn't.

17:51.331 --> 17:53.199
Now put the gun down.

17:58.772 --> 18:00.706
Oh!

18:00.707 --> 18:02.241
You shot him!

18:02.242 --> 18:04.544
Are you okay?

18:04.545 --> 18:05.711
I'm sorry I shot you.

18:05.712 --> 18:06.813
I thought that's
what the nod meant.

18:06.814 --> 18:07.980
It was. It was awesome.

18:07.981 --> 18:09.282
It was actually just like
the end of "Speed,"

18:09.283 --> 18:10.650
which is a pretty good movie.

18:10.651 --> 18:12.084
It's not as good as "Die Hard."
"Die Hard"'s perfect.

18:12.085 --> 18:13.553
Okay, Jake, I'm gonna
go after Figgis.

18:13.554 --> 18:15.288
Yeah, I was gonna say, you
should keep going after Figgis.

18:15.289 --> 18:16.923
Same page, still.

18:16.924 --> 18:18.090
Get out of the car!

18:19.726 --> 18:22.461
Young Jeezy take the wheel!

18:25.401 --> 18:27.133
Freeze, punk!

18:27.134 --> 18:29.235
Yeah, freeze, punk!

18:29.236 --> 18:30.870
Gina, where did you
get that gun?

18:30.871 --> 18:33.139
Lost and found at
the storage facility.

18:33.140 --> 18:35.408
They have boxes of 'em.
They're everywhere.

18:39.847 --> 18:41.147
Hey, Figgis.

18:41.148 --> 18:43.482
My fiancé, Adrian Pimento,
said when I caught you,

18:43.483 --> 18:46.219
I should read you this letter.

18:46.220 --> 18:48.521
"I want to lick the skin
off your body, baby."

18:48.522 --> 18:50.456
Oh, that side's for me.

18:50.457 --> 18:53.960
"I want to rip the skin
off your body, Jimmy."

18:53.961 --> 18:55.761
We're sorry we
doubted you, sir.

18:55.762 --> 18:56.881
You really saved our butts.

18:56.897 --> 18:58.798
I can't take credit for that.

18:58.799 --> 19:00.933
Gina Linetti is the real
hero here.

19:00.934 --> 19:03.836
But isn't Gina Linetti
more of a state of mind?

19:03.837 --> 19:07.206
Like, in a way, we were all
Gina Linetti today.

19:07.207 --> 19:09.808
Gina, let's take this Gina
to the hospital.

19:13.447 --> 19:15.081
Hey, how's the sheriff?

19:15.082 --> 19:17.583
Well, he keeps yelling,
"Disability for life!"

19:17.584 --> 19:19.585
So I think he's fine.

19:19.586 --> 19:21.420
Also, Coral Palms PD
found your marshal

19:21.421 --> 19:23.289
at Figgis's hideout,
alive at well.

19:23.290 --> 19:24.590
Oh, that's great.

19:24.591 --> 19:26.092
Yeah. How are you doing?

19:26.093 --> 19:28.527
Fine... you know, just getting
bandaged up.

19:28.528 --> 19:30.763
Actually, can you
give us a second?

19:30.764 --> 19:32.765
Thanks.

19:32.766 --> 19:33.766
It hurts so bad.

19:33.767 --> 19:34.800
I just didn't want
to seem weak

19:34.801 --> 19:37.303
in front of EMT Craig.

19:37.304 --> 19:39.171
So I know this
is weird to say,

19:39.172 --> 19:40.306
because I just shot you,

19:40.307 --> 19:42.608
but it feels like we're
back in sync now.

19:42.609 --> 19:44.744
Yeah, I mean, as in sync
as I've ever been

19:44.745 --> 19:46.379
with someone who just shot me.

19:52.853 --> 19:54.153
I love you.

19:54.154 --> 19:55.922
I love you too.

19:55.923 --> 19:57.757
Hey, do you happen
to know my blood type?

19:57.758 --> 19:58.758
Yeah. B positive.

19:58.759 --> 19:59.759
Well, guessed wrong.

19:59.760 --> 20:01.570
Hey, Craig?

20:02.296 --> 20:04.096
Hey, Captain Stentley,
we're back.

20:04.097 --> 20:05.231
How was Florida?

20:05.232 --> 20:06.966
- It was fine.
- A lot of college girls.

20:06.967 --> 20:07.967
Come on, man.

20:07.968 --> 20:09.268
Now, before you say anything,

20:09.269 --> 20:11.504
I know we disobeyed
a direct order.

20:11.505 --> 20:13.406
Sergeant, relax, okay?

20:13.407 --> 20:16.509
Your friends were in trouble;
you did what you had to do.

20:16.510 --> 20:18.144
And now I got to do
what I got to do.

20:18.145 --> 20:20.446
Oh, no, a memorandum
of admonishment?

20:20.447 --> 20:22.548
Much worse... you're never
gonna see the sun again.

20:22.549 --> 20:24.817
Your families... they're gonna
forget your faces.

20:24.818 --> 20:27.520
You'll eat lunch at dinnertime
and dinner at breakfast.

20:27.521 --> 20:28.787
And you'll...

20:32.159 --> 20:33.793
Ah, what was I talking about?

20:33.794 --> 20:35.860
I totally lost my train.

20:35.896 --> 20:37.663
- You were punishing us.
- Yes, thank you.

20:37.664 --> 20:38.698
Ah!

20:38.699 --> 20:40.032
I'm transferring the whole squad

20:40.033 --> 20:41.367
to the night shift.

20:41.368 --> 20:46.505
Noooo!

20:46.506 --> 20:47.506
Yes.
