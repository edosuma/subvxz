WEBVTT

01:02.354 --> 01:06.563
So... it's dress blues,
extra starched,

01:06.567 --> 01:10.185
white gloves,
spit shine, whole nine.

01:10.237 --> 01:11.898
Knock, knock.
She opens the door.

01:11.947 --> 01:13.938
Nothing on but the radio.
Talk or Kube 93?

01:13.949 --> 01:15.564
I haven't even touched her yet,

01:15.617 --> 01:17.198
it's already Niagara Falls.

01:17.244 --> 01:18.575
Had to break some laws.

01:18.620 --> 01:19.575
Where is it?

01:19.621 --> 01:21.361
Well, at least
in a couple of months,

01:21.415 --> 01:24.122
that foot of glass between you
won't affect your chemistry.

01:24.126 --> 01:25.616
It's like drinking water.

01:25.627 --> 01:26.958
Get those nutrients you need,

01:26.962 --> 01:29.078
leave the cholesterol
in the cow.

01:29.131 --> 01:31.087
Your mom breast-feed you
until puberty or something?

01:32.217 --> 01:34.003
Hey, colostrum,
on the other hand,

01:34.052 --> 01:36.338
is filled with life-giving
nutrients and whatnot.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.170
Here I thought I was a pervert.

01:38.223 --> 01:40.339
What up, Melloy?
What do you got?

01:40.434 --> 01:41.890
A Jane Doe.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.550
Transient found her
a couple hours ago.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.014
Ripped open the garbage bag
covering her,

01:45.063 --> 01:46.724
didn't notice the smell.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.889
- The coroner's en route?
- Yup.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.729
"Yup." Seriously?
"Yup"?

01:51.778 --> 01:53.769
It's "yes, sir,”
"no, sir."

01:53.780 --> 01:57.398
I mean, seriously.
Are you an idiot? "Yup."

01:57.492 --> 01:59.778
Got a brain? "Nope."

02:59.221 --> 03:02.008
Damn.

03:02.057 --> 03:03.888
Never seen that before.

03:03.934 --> 03:06.050
Almost cut her head clean off.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.166
What the hell is wrong
with you?!

04:13.211 --> 04:14.826
You stupid, crazy bitch,
what are you doing?!

04:14.880 --> 04:16.495
I'm not doing anything.
God, Bullet.

04:16.548 --> 04:18.288
I wasn't gonna jump.
Okay?

04:18.341 --> 04:20.673
Ijust wanted to look
at the water.

04:20.927 --> 04:25.045
Come here.
Come here. Look at it.

04:25.098 --> 04:30.593
Before the boats and garbage
and people and stuff mess it up,

04:30.645 --> 04:33.227
it's so smooth and clean,
you know?

04:33.273 --> 04:35.935
Like glass.

04:35.984 --> 04:38.441
It's perfect.

04:38.487 --> 04:42.025
Ijust wanted to look at it.

04:42.073 --> 04:44.780
You crazy bitch.

04:58.215 --> 05:00.706
Cops ran us out
from under the bridge.

05:00.759 --> 05:03.876
Yeah. Douchebags kicked us
out of the park this morning.

05:03.929 --> 05:06.011
Some sort of citywide sweep.

05:06.056 --> 05:09.014
Oh, whatever. Eat me.

05:10.602 --> 05:14.345
You know
maybe we can get beds at Beacon.

05:14.439 --> 05:15.645
Whatever.

05:15.690 --> 05:18.272
I'm not sure I'm ready to accept
Jesus as my lord.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.274
Never got open beds anyways.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.936
Yeah, well, at least
they got eggs and bacon

05:22.948 --> 05:24.358
on the menu this morning.

05:24.407 --> 05:26.193
- You hungry?
- I hate bacon.

05:26.243 --> 05:29.735
Oh, dude, quit tripping.
Come on, I'm starving.

05:29.788 --> 05:32.200
Look, we'll find a place
to squat.

05:32.249 --> 05:33.989
It's still early.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.082
Let's go. Come on.

05:36.086 --> 05:38.452
Yeah.

05:38.505 --> 05:41.793
I'd estimate her age
at 16 or 17.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.458
Cause of death is multiple
sharp-force injuries

05:44.511 --> 05:46.627
across the neck region.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.968
Cut marks are visible
on the cervical vertebrae.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.723
Vaginal bruising is present.

05:52.769 --> 05:54.725
He raped her?

05:54.771 --> 05:56.352
Leave a calling card, too?

05:56.439 --> 05:58.395
No, he must have used a condom.

05:58.441 --> 05:59.601
Lovely.

05:59.651 --> 06:01.733
Just as we're leading
the pack, this.

06:01.778 --> 06:04.190
We're gonna be chasing down
hookers and hobos,

06:04.239 --> 06:07.356
rounding up the usual suspects
on pedophile mile for months.

06:07.409 --> 06:10.025
Yeah, well, we got to,
so suck it up.

06:10.078 --> 06:13.741
What if we fob her off?

06:13.790 --> 06:16.372
I'm serious.
Who's up next?

06:16.418 --> 06:18.158
It's Jablonski.

06:18.211 --> 06:21.874
Even that guy's not gonna take
some hooker dumped in Katmandu.

06:21.923 --> 06:23.879
Timbuktu.

06:23.925 --> 06:26.007
- Timbuktu.
- Whatever.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.337
We done here, doc?

06:27.429 --> 06:29.715
She fought back.

06:29.764 --> 06:32.221
Defense wounds--
broke her finger.

06:32.225 --> 06:35.058
Your Romeo used a weapon
with a serrated edge.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.096
Held her from behind,

06:36.146 --> 06:38.808
nicked her spinal cord
several times.

06:38.857 --> 06:40.643
It takes a lot of strength
to do that

06:40.692 --> 06:42.102
while the victim's fighting.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.271
He hating on working girls?

06:46.114 --> 06:48.275
Maybe just this girl?

06:48.325 --> 06:49.531
'Cause she wouldn't swallow?

06:49.576 --> 06:51.532
Wow.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.864
You speaking from experience?

06:53.914 --> 06:55.700
We'll call you
when we get a hit on the prints.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.865
And, uh, good luck on
the sergeant's exam, Holder.

06:57.918 --> 06:58.998
Thanks, doc.

06:59.002 --> 07:00.162
He hasn't passed it yet.

07:00.170 --> 07:02.001
No need to blow smoke
up his ass already.

07:02.005 --> 07:04.542
I'm telling you--
Jablonski's our man.

07:04.549 --> 07:06.881
He ain't gonna take it.
No doubt.

07:06.927 --> 07:10.511
He'll do it. He'll do it.
Just let me do the talking.

07:13.725 --> 07:15.090
Heading in.

07:25.862 --> 07:27.818
- What's that? You jack that ring, too?
- Yeah.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.650
Lyric was telling me
about this blue ring

07:29.699 --> 07:31.485
her grandmother used to have.

07:31.534 --> 07:33.490
She would always
try to steal it, but...

07:33.536 --> 07:36.118
I figure, it's blue.

07:36.164 --> 07:37.665
So, are you gonna give it
to her?

07:37.707 --> 07:39.663
I don't know.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.085
You should.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.243
You love her.
Look at you!

07:43.296 --> 07:44.251
Shut up. Shut up!

07:44.297 --> 07:45.798
No.
Twitch will kill you

07:45.840 --> 07:47.876
if he thinks you're moving in
on his woman.

07:47.926 --> 07:50.167
- She ain't his woman.
- I heard they hooked up.

07:50.220 --> 07:52.302
They're squatting together
at the hotel.

07:52.347 --> 07:55.134
You think them playing house
means jack?

07:55.183 --> 07:56.684
No, that low-rent punk
is using her!

07:56.726 --> 07:59.513
I'm gonna kick his
shitty white ass!

07:59.562 --> 08:01.518
Yeah.
He ain't all that.

08:01.564 --> 08:04.021
That boy ain't packing nothing
down them Sean Johns!

08:04.025 --> 08:05.310
So, tell her, dumbass.

08:05.318 --> 08:06.854
Tell her what?

08:06.861 --> 08:08.897
That you like her?

08:08.947 --> 08:10.278
Don't just sit with it,

08:10.323 --> 08:12.530
walking around with it
like you do.

08:12.575 --> 08:14.156
Come here. Let me see it.

08:14.202 --> 08:15.567
Why?

08:15.620 --> 08:17.576
Bullet, come on.

08:17.622 --> 08:20.614
Ready?

08:20.667 --> 08:22.908
- "Bullet, I love you."
- Here, let me get this.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.580
Oh, shut up, man.
Come on. Stand still.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.374
Sure,
I'll take the Jane Doe.

08:30.468 --> 08:33.380
Yeah?
You sure, Jablonski?

08:33.471 --> 08:35.757
You take my drug dealer
down at York Ave.

08:35.807 --> 08:37.047
The projects.

08:37.100 --> 08:41.093
The Williams job?
That's a slam dunk.

08:41.146 --> 08:43.478
If you want to hang down
in banger land.

08:43.523 --> 08:46.481
Which I, for one, do not.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.482
Done... and done.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.984
You want a soda or something?

08:50.030 --> 08:52.487
Yeah, diet, if they got it.

08:52.532 --> 08:53.738
Watching the weight.

08:53.783 --> 08:55.239
Yeah, not me.
Good on you.

08:55.243 --> 08:56.403
Let's go.

08:56.453 --> 08:58.409
You got a case file?

08:58.455 --> 09:01.367
Yeah, yeah, just got to sign off
on some of the paperwork.

09:01.416 --> 09:05.000
Uh, I'll get it back to you.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.706
Huh?

10:55.864 --> 10:56.819
Gotcha!

10:56.865 --> 10:58.105
Aah!

10:58.158 --> 11:01.116
Ah! Don't do that!

11:01.161 --> 11:02.492
Cody!

11:02.537 --> 11:03.993
What?

11:04.038 --> 11:05.289
Oh, man,
you should see your face.

11:05.331 --> 11:07.822
You're a jerk!

11:07.876 --> 11:09.958
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:10.003 --> 11:11.789
You want to get off
the island later?

11:11.838 --> 11:14.250
Get downtown,
catch a band or something?

11:15.675 --> 11:18.087
I would love to...

11:18.136 --> 11:21.469
but I'm working
the afternoon shift.

11:21.514 --> 11:24.472
Yeah?
You weren't on the roster.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.634
I know, but Ron approved it
last minute.

11:27.687 --> 11:33.148
But until then...
I'm free and clear.

11:33.151 --> 11:36.314
Hey. Whoa, whoa.
Hold up.

11:36.321 --> 11:39.688
What?

11:39.741 --> 11:42.858
L-let's just...

11:42.911 --> 11:44.572
What?

11:46.915 --> 11:49.031
Come here.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.998
Oh, my God.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.790
No!

12:01.137 --> 12:02.638
Ray Seward,

12:02.680 --> 12:04.796
this death warrant orders
your execution

12:04.849 --> 12:07.682
in 30 days' time
for the crime of murder

12:07.685 --> 12:11.849
in the first degree
of Trisha Ann Seward.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.856
You will be relocated to
the Intensive Management Unit

12:14.901 --> 12:16.562
and placed on death watch

12:16.569 --> 12:19.185
for the duration
of your incarceration.

12:19.197 --> 12:20.562
Your attorney has been provided

12:20.573 --> 12:22.905
with the same forms
and documentation.

12:22.909 --> 12:25.946
Do you understand everything
Ijust told you?

12:33.461 --> 12:35.793
Good luck, Mr. Seward.

12:56.651 --> 12:58.607
What up, Linden?

12:58.653 --> 13:00.769
I've
been running every morning.

13:00.822 --> 13:02.938
It's been great
living out here.

13:05.493 --> 13:07.575
Nice suit, by the way.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.032
You know how we do.

13:10.081 --> 13:13.573
So, what? You still--
still smoke?

13:13.626 --> 13:16.368
No. I-I gave that up
a while ago. You?

13:16.462 --> 13:18.953
No no, I'm nicotine free.
I

13:19.007 --> 13:20.838
It's been a year.

13:23.678 --> 13:25.839
We've been batting a thousand.

13:25.847 --> 13:30.841
It's me, my partner,
but 7 out of 7 solves.

13:30.893 --> 13:34.135
Been climbing the PD food
chain, politically speaking.

13:34.188 --> 13:36.270
You know? Pretty good
for a first year out.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.147
It sounds like
you're doing great.

13:38.192 --> 13:41.025
You know, it's Joaquim
shooting Rakim, whatever,

13:41.029 --> 13:44.021
but, you know,
it is what it is.

13:44.032 --> 13:47.945
Yep. It is.

13:50.997 --> 13:54.080
I'm gonna take
the sergeant exam in a month.

13:54.125 --> 13:55.114
Wow.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.705
Been hitting the books,
AM to the PM.

13:57.754 --> 13:58.914
Great.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.248
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

14:05.011 --> 14:07.878
And this is Cody.
We work together now.

14:07.889 --> 14:10.005
Well, how do you do?

14:10.016 --> 14:12.177
Hey.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.891
I was just heading out.

14:13.936 --> 14:16.268
Okay. Well,
I'll call you later.

14:16.314 --> 14:17.645
See you, Sarah.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.021
Mm-hmm.

14:24.489 --> 14:26.821
Ain't that sweet.
Linden's datin'.

14:26.824 --> 14:29.156
- I'm not dating.
- Booty-calling, then.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.692
- Dial 1-900-Linden?
- You want milk?

14:30.745 --> 14:32.861
Or are you still doing
that lacto-vegan thing?

14:32.914 --> 14:35.155
Is he one of, uh, Jack's friends?

14:35.208 --> 14:36.323
No, I-I'm not judging.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.662
I mean, that--
that's just sexy, you know?

14:38.711 --> 14:40.292
How did that play out?

14:40.338 --> 14:41.999
He come knocking on the door

14:42.006 --> 14:43.712
and-- and you open up
in your sexy lingerie?

14:43.716 --> 14:44.705
You're not funny.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.708
And he's like,
"is Jack home?"

14:46.719 --> 14:49.005
"No, no, Jack is out
playing, but..."

14:49.055 --> 14:50.170
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

14:50.223 --> 14:53.215
"...come inside and wait."

14:59.482 --> 15:01.097
So, how--
how's little man doing?

15:01.109 --> 15:04.101
I heard he's got himself
a sweet little piece.

15:04.153 --> 15:06.860
Holder.
He has a girlfriend.

15:06.864 --> 15:08.320
Hmm.

15:08.324 --> 15:11.532
You know,
we text every now and then.

15:11.536 --> 15:12.867
Keeps me in the loop.

15:12.870 --> 15:15.612
Yeah, he always liked you
for some reason.

15:15.665 --> 15:19.999
What's not to like?

15:23.214 --> 15:25.170
So, why are you here?

15:25.216 --> 15:27.332
Uh, that case you were working
on a couple of years ago--

15:27.385 --> 15:30.001
the Picasso kid
who did that drawing?

15:30.054 --> 15:32.966
Mom was a hooker,
got her head almost cut off?

15:32.974 --> 15:35.636
Caught a body this morning.

15:35.643 --> 15:38.726
Working girl,
head hanging by a thread, too.

15:38.771 --> 15:42.013
If you're looking for
a connection, there is none.

15:42.066 --> 15:44.557
We got the killer
three years ago, put him away.

15:44.610 --> 15:45.816
End of story.

15:45.862 --> 15:47.978
And now they're gonna
execute him.

15:48.030 --> 15:50.282
I'm guessing you heard.

15:50.324 --> 15:52.485
What do you want, Holder?

15:52.535 --> 15:54.116
I was thinking I'd take a look
at your old case file,

15:54.162 --> 15:55.652
just make sure
there's no connection

15:55.705 --> 15:57.991
between your crack ho and mine.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.826
Good idea. Go for it.

15:59.876 --> 16:03.039
The thing is, the storage says
the box is already checked out.

16:03.045 --> 16:04.546
And they don't know
who took it.

16:04.589 --> 16:06.580
Yeah, but they're a bunch
of idiots down there.

16:06.591 --> 16:08.206
They're always
misplacing boxes.

16:08.259 --> 16:10.625
Just keep looking for it.
You'll find it.

16:13.848 --> 16:17.682
I have to go.

16:31.949 --> 16:33.905
You tell little man
I said, you know...

16:33.951 --> 16:35.612
Mm-hmm, yep, sure.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.861
Looking good, Linden.

16:37.914 --> 16:40.530
Hey, Holder.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.995
Not every victim's worth it.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.664
You know, you start caring...

16:45.713 --> 16:49.331
you'll end up like me working
minimum wage on a ferry.

16:51.469 --> 16:53.960
Neverthought
the day would come

16:54.013 --> 16:56.129
I'd hear that from you.

17:31.008 --> 17:34.125
Moving day, Seward.

17:34.136 --> 17:35.512
You're being transported
to "C" block

17:35.513 --> 17:36.844
three miles down the road.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.675
Should we get stopped
by somebody

17:38.724 --> 17:40.510
trying to remove you
from state custody,

17:40.560 --> 17:42.846
we will shoot you first
right where you sit.

18:01.539 --> 18:05.031
Better enjoy the view.

18:05.042 --> 18:08.785
Last time you'll see it.

18:45.875 --> 18:48.787
I head up
the Intensive Management Unit,

18:48.836 --> 18:50.792
AKA "The Row."

18:50.838 --> 18:52.499
Call me "CO" or "sir."

18:54.675 --> 18:57.462
Now here's what's gonna happen.

18:57.511 --> 18:59.638
We're gonna help you move in.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.012
Don't even have to
buy us a beer.

19:02.058 --> 19:04.014
You've been issued
two sets of underwear,

19:04.060 --> 19:06.346
one pair of trousers,
three changes of shirt,

19:06.395 --> 19:09.353
a toothbrush,
and a stick of deodorant.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.229
Gentlemen.

19:15.905 --> 19:17.566
Backup towards the beanhole.

19:23.829 --> 19:26.081
Now, you got here
faster than most.

19:26.123 --> 19:28.500
My guess is you'll
leave here faster too.

19:30.628 --> 19:32.960
I want to see
the prison chaplain.

19:47.478 --> 19:49.264
Our girl Patrice don't lie.

19:49.271 --> 19:52.638
And she said that girl
had her head cut off.

19:52.983 --> 19:55.565
Oh, quit tripping.
You're so full of it.

19:58.864 --> 19:59.899
Just ignore him.

19:59.949 --> 20:01.359
You know Ricky's
just hoppin' for attention.

20:01.450 --> 20:03.156
I'm not worried about that.

20:03.202 --> 20:06.865
I got to find a place to crash.
I'm done with sleeping outside.

20:06.914 --> 20:08.870
- You got money?
- I got $20.

20:08.916 --> 20:11.123
I might pull a date,
but it won't be enough.

20:11.168 --> 20:13.079
I got to get
more Pall Malls, too.

20:13.129 --> 20:15.962
Damn, girl, I'll jack you cigs.
Don't worry about that.

20:16.006 --> 20:17.792
- Besides--
- Don't look.

20:17.842 --> 20:20.254
It's just Joe
and his rank-ass cab.

20:20.302 --> 20:21.257
What of it?

20:21.303 --> 20:23.635
I don't want Joe stopping.
God!

20:23.639 --> 20:25.800
Why?
He do something to you?

20:33.816 --> 20:38.059
Hey, what's up, man?
Give me a pack of Victories.

20:38.112 --> 20:40.273
Thanks.

20:52.877 --> 20:56.119
What's up?

20:56.172 --> 20:57.332
What's up, little man?

20:57.381 --> 21:01.841
Hey, you hear about a missing
girl from around here?

21:01.886 --> 21:04.969
If you ain't arresting me,
I don't got to talk to you.

21:05.014 --> 21:07.801
Something I should be
arresting you for?

21:07.850 --> 21:09.636
Not a thing.

21:09.685 --> 21:11.971
But unless I'm in cuffs
or in the back of your ride,

21:12.021 --> 21:13.477
I don't got to talk to you.

21:13.522 --> 21:14.637
Yeah, you already said that.

21:14.690 --> 21:15.975
Yeah, just in case you forgot.

21:16.025 --> 21:17.481
No, you're pretty, uh,
unforgettable,

21:17.526 --> 21:18.561
there, little man.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.727
And you're pretty slow,
there, five-0.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.361
I ain't a boy.

21:22.448 --> 21:23.688
Ah!

21:23.741 --> 21:25.902
I can see that.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.243
What about you, baby?

21:29.246 --> 21:31.362
Hear about a little girl
missing from around here?

21:31.415 --> 21:32.495
No.

21:32.541 --> 21:36.204
Yo, po, you're not
getting any donuts?

21:36.253 --> 21:38.915
I don't eat donuts.
Mm.

21:38.964 --> 21:40.579
As a matter of fact,

21:40.633 --> 21:42.589
I don't eat anything
that's processed.

21:42.635 --> 21:43.875
Why?

21:43.928 --> 21:46.010
'Cause you want to retain
your youthful, glowing skin?

21:46.055 --> 21:48.546
'Cause even the Taj Mahal
needs upkeep.

21:48.599 --> 21:50.760
Whatever.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.596
You just get old and nasty
'cause you get old and nasty.

21:52.645 --> 21:55.637
I mean, look at you.
Forilla.

21:58.984 --> 22:00.440
You hear about
a missing girl or what?

22:00.486 --> 22:02.772
Man, get off of my block.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.062
You heard me-- get.

22:04.114 --> 22:06.776
Bullet, no. Shut up.

22:06.826 --> 22:09.533
All right, peace out...

22:09.578 --> 22:11.034
Bullet.

22:12.706 --> 22:14.992
Yeah, you get,
Mr. Police!

22:15.042 --> 22:17.124
You come back, you're gonna get
a bullet in your greasy ass--

22:17.127 --> 22:19.994
you want to act like a man,
I will treat you like a man.

22:20.005 --> 22:21.506
Make no mistake about it,

22:21.507 --> 22:24.499
I'll swipe the floor with your
little, baby, butch, bitch ass

22:24.552 --> 22:27.089
right in front of your
little skank-ho girlfriend.

22:27.137 --> 22:30.345
You feel me?

22:35.855 --> 22:37.641
Peace out, po-po.

22:41.402 --> 22:43.188
Hey, babe.

22:43.237 --> 22:45.774
No, no, nothing's wrong.

23:01.797 --> 23:04.209
You were everything
she wanted.

23:04.258 --> 23:06.419
She knew it the minute
she met you.

23:06.468 --> 23:08.595
And she just couldn't shut up
about it, ever.

23:11.807 --> 23:14.014
Regi and Ellen,

23:18.355 --> 23:21.142
And Ijust couldn't be happier
for you two.

23:21.191 --> 23:25.150
'Cause it's so rare, that...

23:25.195 --> 23:29.234
a person who sees
who you are at your core...

23:29.283 --> 23:33.947
who sees what you're good at...

23:33.996 --> 23:37.784
what you love to do
more than anything...

23:37.833 --> 23:40.165
who you really are...

23:46.759 --> 23:50.047
I hope you're ready to spend
a lot of time on the open sea.

23:50.054 --> 23:51.590
Congratulations.

23:51.597 --> 23:53.588
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

23:53.641 --> 23:55.927
- Cheers. - Cheers.
- Cheers. - Cheers.

24:02.733 --> 24:04.519
Can I bum one, mom?

24:06.028 --> 24:07.689
Hi.

24:07.738 --> 24:09.023
You coming back in?

24:09.031 --> 24:12.740
Yeah. In a bit.

24:12.743 --> 24:14.734
Have you had a nice trip?

24:14.745 --> 24:17.908
Yeah, it's been great
seeing Nash and Dillon.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.618
You too.

24:22.503 --> 24:24.789
You gonna be okay
when I go home?

24:24.838 --> 24:27.124
I think I can handle it.

24:29.718 --> 24:33.131
Your dad said he would
meet you at the airport.

24:33.180 --> 24:36.297
And, uh, that I should check
and make sure

24:36.350 --> 24:40.263
you finished all of your English
and Algebra homework.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.644
Idid.

24:42.690 --> 24:45.523
He said you're doing awesome
in school.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.785
You ever think about
moving to Chicago?

24:57.830 --> 25:00.071
I don't really know
anybody there.

25:00.124 --> 25:03.207
Besides you and your dad.

25:03.252 --> 25:06.961
We can see each other
a lot more.

25:06.964 --> 25:10.172
Yeah, that's true.

25:10.217 --> 25:14.381
So, why are you
still here, then?

25:25.274 --> 25:27.811
We should go. We don't
want to miss your plane.

25:38.996 --> 25:40.111
He hits a puddle.

25:40.122 --> 25:42.113
He goes sliding across
the pavement,

25:42.124 --> 25:46.618
skinning his knee, his back--
it was hilarious.

25:49.506 --> 25:51.622
All out of PB and J's.

26:03.020 --> 26:04.851
I don't eat meat, bitch.

26:04.897 --> 26:07.013
Got you fries.

26:07.024 --> 26:08.309
"Why, thank you, Carl.

26:08.358 --> 26:10.690
That's so thoughtful
and considerate of you."

26:10.736 --> 26:11.942
Yeah, whatever.

26:11.945 --> 26:13.936
Hey. Jablonski...

26:13.947 --> 26:15.403
you think he's ID'd her yet?

26:15.491 --> 26:16.776
Who?

26:16.825 --> 26:18.611
Jane Doe.

26:18.660 --> 26:19.820
I mean, you think
he would have by now.

26:19.828 --> 26:21.989
I mean, you think he's
on to Missing Person at least?

26:21.997 --> 26:23.828
Damn it.

26:23.874 --> 26:26.786
UW down by 6,
less than a minute.

26:26.835 --> 26:28.951
I thought you guys
wanted to go dancing.

26:29.004 --> 26:31.996
Yeah, we need more touchdowns.

26:32.007 --> 26:34.794
Be a miracle,
since it's basketball.

26:38.013 --> 26:39.969
Not our case anymore, man.

26:40.015 --> 26:41.346
Yeah, I know.

26:41.350 --> 26:44.057
You need to be making
upward moves, not lateral ones.

26:44.103 --> 26:46.389
Homicide's either a way station
or a crypt.

26:46.438 --> 26:47.427
Look at Jablonski.

26:47.481 --> 26:48.766
I know.

26:48.816 --> 26:52.809
All right, then. Hit the books.
Quit being a bitch.

26:52.861 --> 26:54.647
Oh, I hate losing to Wazzu.

26:54.696 --> 26:57.483
Yeah.
Detective Holder.

26:57.533 --> 26:58.864
Hi, Detective.

26:58.909 --> 27:01.321
Coroner's got an ID
on the Jane Doe you brought in.

27:01.370 --> 27:05.033
When do you want to pick up
the paperwork?

27:05.040 --> 27:08.874
Uh... yeah, yeah.

27:08.919 --> 27:12.082
Mm, about an hour or two?

27:12.131 --> 27:16.090
- Fine.
- All right. I'll see you there.

27:16.135 --> 27:18.626
Caroline.

27:18.679 --> 27:21.091
Wanted to know what time
I'm finishing up here.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.631
See? That's what
I'm talking about.

27:35.028 --> 27:37.064
When was the last time
you saw your daughter?

27:37.114 --> 27:39.776
Six months ago.

27:39.825 --> 27:42.407
It started when Ashley
got involved

27:42.494 --> 27:45.736
with some kids
from her middle school.

27:45.789 --> 27:48.576
She's 14.

27:48.625 --> 27:52.994
She probably told you
she's older?

27:53.046 --> 27:55.583
Well, it's not true.

27:55.632 --> 27:58.214
There's a treatment center
in Minnesota.

27:58.260 --> 28:00.922
They've agreed to take her
as soon as she comes home.

28:00.971 --> 28:04.384
She's here...
isn't she?

28:04.433 --> 28:07.220
I'm sorry.

28:07.269 --> 28:10.636
Your daughter, her body
was found this morning.

28:10.689 --> 28:13.101
I'm gonna need you to come down
to the coroner's office...

28:13.150 --> 28:15.857
No.

28:15.861 --> 28:17.692
...identify her.

28:17.696 --> 28:21.314
No!

28:21.325 --> 28:23.987
No!

28:28.790 --> 28:31.702
Hey, mom.

28:34.755 --> 28:36.916
If it's money you want,
I don't got it.

28:36.924 --> 28:38.755
Why did you change the locks?

28:38.759 --> 28:40.750
'Cause I don't like you coming
up in here whenever you please

28:40.761 --> 28:43.218
like my house
is some damn hotel.

28:43.263 --> 28:45.720
Well, I called you earlier
like a bunch of times.

28:45.766 --> 28:46.801
Where were you?

28:46.808 --> 28:48.969
Oh. You got a phone now.

28:48.977 --> 28:50.968
It's a burner, mom.
It's like 15 bucks.

28:51.021 --> 28:54.104
Yeah, which you could be paying
towards helping me with rent.

28:54.149 --> 28:56.811
You don't even let me
stay here.

28:56.860 --> 28:57.975
You're grown.

28:58.028 --> 29:00.644
You need to learn
how to pull your own weight.

29:00.697 --> 29:02.278
I take care of myself.

29:02.324 --> 29:04.315
Then why are you here?

29:12.042 --> 29:15.000
You eat today?

29:15.003 --> 29:16.118
No.

29:16.171 --> 29:17.832
You want something hot?

29:17.881 --> 29:19.997
I got frozen patties
from Costco.

29:20.008 --> 29:21.794
Can fry them up--
it'd just take a sec.

29:21.802 --> 29:23.793
Not hungry.

29:31.520 --> 29:34.683
What are you looking at?

29:34.731 --> 29:38.189
I need lipstick and eye stuff.

29:38.235 --> 29:42.023
Number 483.
Pretty in pink.

29:42.030 --> 29:44.362
It'll look good on me,
don't you think?

29:44.408 --> 29:48.026
You got my coloring.
Sure it will.

29:48.078 --> 29:50.034
Pink's a good color for us.

29:50.080 --> 29:53.072
Yeah. It is.

29:59.381 --> 30:02.168
Mom?

30:02.217 --> 30:04.583
- Ma.
- What?

30:12.352 --> 30:14.308
You can't stay here.

30:14.354 --> 30:16.515
Maybe tomorrow or this weekend,

30:16.565 --> 30:19.853
but tonight I got stuff
going on.

30:19.901 --> 30:21.892
He's coming over, isn't he?

30:21.945 --> 30:23.355
When are you gonna learn
to watch your mouth?

30:23.405 --> 30:24.736
Show him some respect?

30:24.781 --> 30:26.362
You know, he told me what you
said about his truck.

30:26.408 --> 30:28.740
I didn't say anything
about his stupid beat-up truck.

30:28.785 --> 30:30.195
Right.

30:30.245 --> 30:32.736
You're not gonna ruin this
for me, not this time.

30:32.789 --> 30:34.199
He's good to me,
and he's good for me.

30:34.249 --> 30:35.910
Why can't you just let me
have that?

30:35.959 --> 30:37.495
Let me be happy for once.

30:37.544 --> 30:41.287
Well, I'm sorry I screwed up
your whole life by being born.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.877
Yeah, well, you did.

31:02.235 --> 31:05.398
May I sit with you?

31:05.489 --> 31:08.071
Do they ever clean
these windows?

31:08.116 --> 31:10.607
I don't think so.

31:10.660 --> 31:12.787
It makes everything
out there look murky

31:12.829 --> 31:16.788
like you're looking
through a shower glass.

31:16.833 --> 31:19.825
It's gonna be this way the whole
time I'm here, isn't it?

31:19.836 --> 31:23.078
Yeah. It is.

31:23.131 --> 31:27.249
They got two alpine larch
right there.

31:27.302 --> 31:29.634
See?

31:29.679 --> 31:32.466
I had a tree like that
out my window when I was a boy.

31:32.516 --> 31:35.633
Slept on the fold-out...

31:35.685 --> 31:37.471
TV room.

31:37.521 --> 31:40.934
The thing never had
any leaves on it.

31:43.693 --> 31:46.025
Well, it's like coming home...

31:46.029 --> 31:47.314
this place.

31:47.364 --> 31:50.902
There's just nothing to look at
except those trees.

31:52.369 --> 31:54.860
So, I don't believe in Jesus
and all that shit,

31:54.913 --> 31:56.699
so you can leave it alone.

31:56.706 --> 31:58.867
Okay...

31:58.917 --> 32:02.330
And I'm not confessing...

32:02.337 --> 32:04.328
either...

32:04.339 --> 32:09.709
absolving my sins
so that I can see my maker.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.547
I'm not here to make you do

32:11.596 --> 32:14.008
anything
you don't want to do, Ray.

32:14.057 --> 32:17.720
God isn't listening anyway.

32:17.769 --> 32:20.010
Maybe, maybe not.

32:30.907 --> 32:35.367
You people just never give up,
never give it a rest.

32:35.370 --> 32:37.361
Now, why is that?

32:37.372 --> 32:41.206
I sit with a lot of men, Ray.
Men like you.

32:41.251 --> 32:43.708
And I guess whatever relief
I can bring them,

32:43.753 --> 32:47.792
in their final days,
is why I don't give it a rest.

32:53.305 --> 32:57.093
Are you gonna be there
when they kill me?

32:57.142 --> 33:00.851
If you want me there, yes.

33:05.692 --> 33:08.274
IfI wanted...

33:08.320 --> 33:10.811
Oh, man.

33:10.864 --> 33:14.982
IfI was gonna ask
for forgiveness...

33:15.035 --> 33:17.822
how would I do it?

33:17.871 --> 33:19.827
What do you want
forgiveness for?

33:19.873 --> 33:21.113
Sta rt with that.

33:22.751 --> 33:25.163
For what I did...

33:27.255 --> 33:30.463
to my wife and...

33:32.802 --> 33:35.384
to my son.

33:35.472 --> 33:38.305
Well, then talk
about that, Ray.

33:41.144 --> 33:42.133
- Go! Go! Go!
- Get in there!

33:42.187 --> 33:43.518
No!

33:43.563 --> 33:45.724
Back off!

33:48.068 --> 33:49.228
Need a medic!

35:47.896 --> 35:52.139
The last execution
was two years ago.

35:52.192 --> 35:54.854
This is what these guys
live for,

35:54.903 --> 35:56.689
and you want to give them
more of a reason

35:56.738 --> 35:58.854
to make your life in here hell.

35:58.907 --> 36:02.149
They don't need a reason.
They never did.

36:02.202 --> 36:03.783
What do you want?

36:03.828 --> 36:05.204
I know why you passed
on your appeals.

36:05.246 --> 36:06.531
You're not gonna
drag things out.

36:06.581 --> 36:08.037
- I get it.
- No.

36:08.041 --> 36:09.156
You don't get anything,

36:09.209 --> 36:11.325
'cause you're on the other side
of this glass.

36:13.463 --> 36:16.421
So there's very little
that you get.

36:16.466 --> 36:19.754
We have one appeal left.
The Governor.

36:19.803 --> 36:23.045
You can still save your life,
or at least try to.

36:23.098 --> 36:25.134
This is our last shot.

36:25.183 --> 36:29.176
Think of your son.
Adrian's 10, right?

36:31.106 --> 36:34.018
There's still time
to be a father to him.

36:36.486 --> 36:39.273
All right, then.
You convinced me.

36:41.324 --> 36:43.701
Forget lethal injection.

36:43.702 --> 36:44.942
Make them hang me,

36:44.994 --> 36:47.030
'cause I got that right
in Washington State...

36:47.038 --> 36:51.828
to be hanged, so that way,
when they kill me,

36:51.876 --> 36:55.494
they'll hear it.

36:55.547 --> 36:59.335
Aah!

37:03.471 --> 37:05.257
We have three beds
available tonight.

37:05.306 --> 37:09.640
Three beds. Make sure
you got your tickets, kids.

37:11.104 --> 37:14.062
Hey, Lyric.

37:14.107 --> 37:16.063
You and Twitch flopping
at the hotel tonight?

37:16.109 --> 37:19.317
Nah, we got run out
'cause Animal Control came?

37:19.362 --> 37:21.023
Took all of Nisey's cats.

37:21.030 --> 37:24.193
Said the hotel
was a "health hazard."

37:24.200 --> 37:25.576
Bet the cats got worms.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.568
Got to give them a bunch
of pills to get rid of them.

37:27.579 --> 37:29.194
The worms.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.613
Bullet's gonna be
a veterinarian.

37:31.624 --> 37:33.910
- Yeah?
- Giraffe's got four stomachs.

37:33.918 --> 37:35.749
- That's nasty.
- Yeah.

37:35.754 --> 37:37.995
They have to digest their food
a bunch of times,

37:38.047 --> 37:39.548
which is why
they're always chewing.

37:39.591 --> 37:41.923
They're even-toed
ungulates.

37:43.386 --> 37:44.762
Okay.

37:51.436 --> 37:54.348
It's kind of cute
when you go off like that, B.

37:54.439 --> 37:56.725
Can I get your attention?

37:56.775 --> 37:58.015
Hey.

37:58.067 --> 37:59.898
Eyes up front.

37:59.903 --> 38:02.440
Anybody see Ashley?

38:02.489 --> 38:03.899
Unless someone has,

38:03.948 --> 38:06.610
I'm gonna have to give up her
bunk to someone else tonight.

38:21.883 --> 38:23.168
She's just stupid.

38:25.678 --> 38:28.465
Forget about her.

38:28.515 --> 38:30.631
It's gonna get stolen here.

38:30.683 --> 38:33.971
I'll keep it until
you want it back or whatever.

38:34.020 --> 38:36.682
All right, we got three
empty beds tonight.

38:36.731 --> 38:38.312
Let's find out
who are the lucky winners!

38:38.358 --> 38:40.189
It's about time.

38:40.235 --> 38:42.191
I got number 5...

38:42.237 --> 38:43.602
Right here.

38:43.613 --> 38:46.070
- ...number 22...
- 22! That's me!

38:46.074 --> 38:50.158
...and...
lucky number 13!

38:50.203 --> 38:52.489
That's me, Pastor Mike.

38:52.539 --> 38:54.279
Looks like you're in
for the night, Bullet.

38:54.332 --> 38:55.742
In the meantime,

38:55.792 --> 38:56.907
all those of you living off
the land tonight...

38:56.960 --> 38:58.075
Here. Take my ticket.

38:58.127 --> 38:59.458
...our thoughts
and our prayers are with you.

38:59.504 --> 39:00.994
Bullet, no, don't be stupid.

39:01.005 --> 39:02.711
I can stay at my mom's.

39:02.757 --> 39:05.999
She said I could
if I didn't get a bed here.

39:07.095 --> 39:10.053
Catch you later?

39:10.098 --> 39:11.929
Don't venture too far.

39:11.975 --> 39:14.762
We open at 6:00 AM tomorrow--
we got hot breakfast,

39:14.811 --> 39:18.770
hot showers, dry clothes,
you can have a nap.

39:18.815 --> 39:20.601
I hope to see you all tomorrow.

39:20.650 --> 39:22.641
God bless.

39:33.538 --> 39:36.871
What is this?

39:36.875 --> 39:39.287
Sarah?

39:39.335 --> 39:41.542
Sarah!

40:12.994 --> 40:15.235
Did she have any rings
on her fingers?

40:19.918 --> 40:21.874
Nope.
