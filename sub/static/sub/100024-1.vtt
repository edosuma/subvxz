17:23.738 --> 17:26.784
Seren, go and wait
for me outside.

17:29.744 --> 17:32.051
Don't go or speak to anyone.

17:40.885 --> 17:42.104
Wow.

17:43.453 --> 17:46.674
Why would you use that language?

17:46.717 --> 17:47.849
Doctor Woods says you're

17:47.892 --> 17:49.285
-one of her top--
-Woods-Trap.

17:50.199 --> 17:51.983
Excuse me?

17:52.027 --> 17:55.422
Do you know we can have you
removed from this school.

17:55.465 --> 17:59.078
You decided to fight during
your only Gifted class,

17:59.121 --> 18:00.427
the reason you're
in a Magnet school.

18:00.470 --> 18:01.732
I didn't hit him.

18:01.776 --> 18:03.299
[Principal] You provoked.

18:03.343 --> 18:04.257
I told him the truth.

18:04.300 --> 18:07.216
You called him a racial slur.

18:07.260 --> 18:11.786
I'm black, he wants to be,
that ain't racist.

18:11.829 --> 18:16.269
Dr. Woods-Trap says you are
interested in Hurston Prep.

18:16.312 --> 18:18.401
Is that right?

18:19.315 --> 18:21.012
I asked you a question.

18:22.362 --> 18:24.451
Yes, ma'am.

18:24.494 --> 18:27.149
If they saw the word altercation
on your school records,

18:27.193 --> 18:31.110
whether you punched or
provoked, if they saw it,

18:31.153 --> 18:33.634
they wouldn't even look
at your application.

18:34.374 --> 18:35.853
Do you understand?

18:36.506 --> 18:37.725
Yes, ma'am.

18:37.768 --> 18:39.596
Now get your mom on the phone.

18:41.772 --> 18:43.296
I can't.

18:43.339 --> 18:44.601
[Principal] Why not?

18:46.342 --> 18:48.039
The phone's off.

18:48.083 --> 18:50.129
[Principal] She doesn't
have a phone or even a cell?

18:52.305 --> 18:53.958
How long?

18:58.441 --> 19:00.574
Since the lights came back on.

19:02.358 --> 19:04.099
You don't have lights?

19:05.187 --> 19:06.319
They're back on now.

19:07.363 --> 19:08.364
When, wait.

19:11.628 --> 19:14.892
David, did you have
breakfast this morning?

19:19.419 --> 19:21.899
[students chatter]

19:30.560 --> 19:33.433
[bell rings]

19:41.615 --> 19:44.835
[pen scratches]

20:34.450 --> 20:36.191
Seren, your parents.

20:41.457 --> 20:43.111
I cannot believe you two.

20:45.461 --> 20:48.247
Wait 'til your step-daddy
hears about this.

20:53.469 --> 20:55.689
David is,
it's a Gifted class,

20:55.732 --> 20:58.300
everyone else in the class
does not look like him

20:58.344 --> 21:00.041
and it's happened before
where I have caught him

21:00.084 --> 21:01.695
making comments about
light-skin this, Rican that.

21:01.738 --> 21:02.913
That's my point.

21:02.957 --> 21:04.567
-Please.
-It seems like.

21:07.353 --> 21:09.180
In all of David's other classes,

21:09.224 --> 21:11.705
the ones that aren't Gifted,
he's surrounded by people

21:11.748 --> 21:15.535
who look like him, but in
my class it's different,

21:15.578 --> 21:16.666
he's the only one.

21:16.710 --> 21:18.364
Seren is black.

21:18.407 --> 21:21.758
The only one who looks like him.

21:23.369 --> 21:25.458
Surely you don't want
me to diagram colorism

21:25.501 --> 21:27.851
just now, Principal.

21:27.895 --> 21:31.942
He looks around and it cues
him that he's the only one

21:31.986 --> 21:35.337
and he tries to excel,
he tries to be the best,

21:35.381 --> 21:38.340
and he tries to prove that
he deserved to be there

21:38.384 --> 21:40.951
and I think this time it
just got the better of him.

21:42.518 --> 21:44.825
I'd like him to
see the counselor.

21:46.957 --> 21:48.350
Okay.

21:51.179 --> 21:52.354
Thank you.

21:52.398 --> 21:54.008
You're not the mother.

21:54.051 --> 21:56.576
He needs his mother to sign
off for him to do that.

21:56.619 --> 21:58.186
I didn't say...

21:59.492 --> 22:00.536
Okay.

22:00.580 --> 22:03.234
I have real concerns here.

22:03.278 --> 22:06.586
He just told me they didn't
have lights in the home

22:06.629 --> 22:07.674
and the phone is out of service

22:07.717 --> 22:10.372
and I'm not sure
he's even eating.

22:10.416 --> 22:14.202
I think we need to see if
the student is acting out

22:14.245 --> 22:15.464
because of home.

22:16.639 --> 22:18.554
He told you this?

22:18.598 --> 22:19.816
Uh-hum.

22:22.428 --> 22:25.169
I'll talk to Dr. Green,

22:25.213 --> 22:26.910
but I need
his mother's signature

22:26.954 --> 22:29.739
or it's in-school suspension.

A-Afternoon.

Vespers.

24:29.250 --> 24:31.426
Woods-Trap taught y'all that?

24:32.253 --> 24:33.602
What's vespers?

24:33.646 --> 24:38.868
-It's blessed by the name.
-Oh shit.

24:38.912 --> 24:42.306
Come on Jay, let me know more.

24:43.569 --> 24:46.441
Vespers comes from
Latin vesperus.

-Meaning.

let me finish?

24:55.363 --> 24:56.669

-I'm tired.
-Weary look like.

25:14.861 --> 25:17.516
How'd it go with the assignment?

25:17.559 --> 25:19.213
I'm trying to go home.

25:19.256 --> 25:20.649
Oh yeah?

I meant, temporary.

25:27.874 --> 25:30.833

25:30.877 --> 25:33.575

here to protect you.

from these projects.

you ain't got to get--

I didn't go.

25:51.941 --> 25:52.899
What?

25:52.942 --> 25:54.161
I told you to go first.

Step back!

26:26.323 --> 26:29.718
Aw, Dai, JG was just
about to get loose on him.

26:29.762 --> 26:31.546
Why you stop this shit, Dai?

26:31.590 --> 26:32.939
This your brother, Shinobi?

26:32.982 --> 26:34.331
Where yours at, you
looking out for yours?

26:34.375 --> 26:35.724
Watch you mouth, nigga.

26:35.768 --> 26:37.291
Naw, naw, naw,
don't tell him no.

26:37.334 --> 26:38.509
Keep talking shit.

26:38.553 --> 26:40.163
I should fuck your ass, nigger.

26:40.207 --> 26:41.164
[David] What?

26:41.208 --> 26:42.731
No, you heard me.

Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay,
you did, my nigga,

26:44.646 --> 26:47.649

the fuck you saying, bro.

26:47.693 --> 26:50.565
All right y'all,
shows over y'all.

26:50.609 --> 26:52.611
Disperse, get the hell on.

26:57.833 --> 27:00.662
Say, Brother Dai,
we got a situation here,

27:00.706 --> 27:03.186
think you could help me?

27:03.230 --> 27:07.669
We need a lookout for tonight,
backs without eyes.

27:07.713 --> 27:10.541
And we asked Willie Derrick
here if he'd do it.

27:10.585 --> 27:12.674
He's more than
happy to, in fact,

27:12.718 --> 27:14.110
little nigga decided
to run his mouth

27:14.154 --> 27:16.156
all over elementary
that he was lookout

27:16.199 --> 27:17.723
for the 'ville tonight.

27:17.766 --> 27:18.767
Naw, naw, Raynan,
that's not how it happened.

27:18.811 --> 27:19.986
JG was the one snitching.

27:20.029 --> 27:21.683
I oughta chop your ass again,

27:21.727 --> 27:23.642
you putting my name
of snitch, oh God.

27:23.685 --> 27:24.991
I'm saying who told then?

27:25.034 --> 27:27.341
I told your broke
ass I told [mumbles],

27:27.384 --> 27:29.125
running trap is in my blood.

27:29.169 --> 27:31.780
And this nigger right
here, he's my brother,

27:31.824 --> 27:33.739
he was fixin' to be a boss,
goes running with Sky.

27:33.782 --> 27:35.958
You got a load of
that fire man,

27:36.002 --> 27:38.961
said you was about to
be king of this, Dai.

27:39.005 --> 27:41.790
No disrespect, Raynan,
but my brother misspoke,

27:41.834 --> 27:43.183
I was about nothin'.

27:43.226 --> 27:47.230
Naw, since Willie Derrick
here just got dusted

27:47.274 --> 27:49.493
front the whole damn jacks,
we gonna need somebody else

27:49.537 --> 27:52.845
to be watch boy for us
tonight, you understand?

27:52.888 --> 27:54.673
-Man.
-Go play.

27:57.066 --> 27:59.416
You see what I'm
dealing with, Dai?

27:59.460 --> 28:02.724
We need somebody
to take his place.

28:02.768 --> 28:06.293
As you well know pay's pretty
good for late hours work,

28:06.336 --> 28:08.861

28:08.904 --> 28:10.601
Naw, he busy.

28:14.867 --> 28:18.871
I'm only asking as
a temporary thing,

28:18.914 --> 28:23.484
while I'm settin' up shop, until
we could find someone else.

28:24.746 --> 28:26.400
I got you, I'll do it.

28:26.443 --> 28:28.184

28:28.228 --> 28:30.970
You can't, not with faggot-ass
Mr. Lodger watching y'all.

28:31.013 --> 28:32.493
Nigger, what I said?

28:33.842 --> 28:35.452
It's only for
tonight though man.

28:35.496 --> 28:37.411

29:03.045 --> 29:05.221
I asked you to go home,
man, straight home.

29:05.265 --> 29:07.441
Man, Willie Derrick
was talking shit.

29:07.484 --> 29:08.877
Jonathan, what if I was late?

29:08.921 --> 29:10.836
What if you had busted his lip

29:10.879 --> 29:12.925
or even the police had come
around and caught you dustin'?

29:12.968 --> 29:14.317
Then what?

29:14.361 --> 29:16.798
Man, Raynan's got
your back though.

29:17.930 --> 29:21.498
Nigger, Raynan ain't
with nobody man.

29:21.542 --> 29:23.849
He may talk like he's
running shit for Sky,
but don't believe it JG.

29:23.892 --> 29:26.982
Hey, you gotta learn to
look people in their eyes
when they talk.

29:27.026 --> 29:29.898
Stop listening to their
mouth and look in they eyes man.

29:38.864 --> 29:40.648
Don't say nothin' about tonight.

29:45.131 --> 29:46.175

29:46.219 --> 29:47.307
Hey, Momma.

29:47.350 --> 29:48.787
Hey, baby Jay.

29:50.571 --> 29:53.617
Why you look like that?

29:53.661 --> 29:55.010
He was dirt diving
with Willie Derrick

29:55.054 --> 29:56.359
when I walked up on him.

29:57.230 --> 29:58.971
Wash up, JG.

30:03.192 --> 30:04.454
Was he fightin'?

30:05.760 --> 30:07.109
It was me fightin'.

30:08.328 --> 30:09.546
What? Who?

30:09.590 --> 30:11.505
Me and Seren, we got into it.

30:11.548 --> 30:13.507
The principal said she called.

30:13.550 --> 30:15.074

30:15.117 --> 30:16.858
No, ma'am.

30:16.902 --> 30:19.078
-You lyin' to me.
-I don't lie to you ma'am.

30:19.121 --> 30:22.429
Hmm, you just don't
tell me everything.

30:24.126 --> 30:26.172
The principal's watching me.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.958
Watching?
What does that mean?

30:31.786 --> 30:34.006
She say you gotta sign this.

30:34.049 --> 30:36.443
[JG] Ma, I got soap in my eyes.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.838
It's washing dirt that's
why it hurt, baby,

30:39.881 --> 30:41.709
just use the water.

30:52.459 --> 30:54.722
This says you need
to see the counselor.

30:56.202 --> 30:57.899
David.

31:04.210 --> 31:06.081
What she say?

31:06.952 --> 31:09.258
Why you gotta see the counselor?

31:13.045 --> 31:14.873
She's worried I'm not...

31:16.004 --> 31:18.093
getting everything I need.

31:23.055 --> 31:24.447
At home?

31:33.413 --> 31:35.110
I'm clean.

31:35.981 --> 31:37.199
Yes ma'am.

31:39.506 --> 31:40.942
I don't lie to you.

31:42.639 --> 31:43.902
I know that.

31:47.079 --> 31:49.472
Things been better, right?

31:59.047 --> 32:00.831
Why you home?

32:00.875 --> 32:03.008
I got a shift switch, so I
could come bring you some food

32:03.051 --> 32:04.531
before the next.
This for tonight,

32:04.574 --> 32:06.663

if I'm not here.

32:08.100 --> 32:10.276
So, what?
You not staying?

32:10.319 --> 32:13.105
Take that money on the
counter to Miss Elijah.

Integrity, it means something.

51:11.155 --> 51:12.330
You understand?

51:13.374 --> 51:14.941
Yes ma'am.

51:14.984 --> 51:18.162
I'm not gonna action the
in-school suspension,

51:18.205 --> 51:20.164
but I want you to see Dr. Green.

51:21.556 --> 51:24.777
He's gonna talk to you
and get an understanding

51:24.820 --> 51:26.996
of how you're doing
here at Galvin.

51:27.040 --> 51:29.825
Just a couple of sessions.

51:29.869 --> 51:33.829
He's not in today,
but next week, okay?

51:40.053 --> 51:41.794
What about Seren?

51:41.837 --> 51:44.971
Get your late pass,
get to class.

51:47.974 --> 51:50.759
[upbeat music]

51:50.803 --> 51:52.283
Integrity!

52:00.421 --> 52:01.335
Yo, SK!

52:01.379 --> 52:03.381
You taking a deuce?

52:04.991 --> 52:08.037
[dramatic music]

52:24.619 --> 52:26.534
What?

52:26.578 --> 52:28.406
You want something?

52:37.937 --> 52:40.592
[thunder crashes]

53:06.966 --> 53:08.446
[Sky] Got past me today.

53:11.100 --> 53:13.364
I ain't get a chance
to talk to you.

53:14.669 --> 53:16.410
I ain't supposed to see you.

53:17.977 --> 53:19.239
[Sky laughs]

53:19.283 --> 53:23.243
Yeah, it's cool,
little man, I'll go.

53:25.463 --> 53:28.030
I ain't supposed to
be seeing you at all,

53:28.074 --> 53:29.380
you ain't here.

53:30.468 --> 53:32.252
Kept talking about I
gotta do what I gotta do

53:32.296 --> 53:35.299
and make a choice now.

53:38.911 --> 53:40.869
What do I do now, huh?

53:40.913 --> 53:42.436
[Sky] No, you need

53:42.480 --> 53:43.959
-to calm down, Dai.
-I'm ready.

53:44.003 --> 53:45.265
All right, Dai.

53:45.309 --> 53:46.962
You need to go on and sit down.

53:47.006 --> 53:49.443
Yo, fuck you,
that dude is my friend.

53:49.487 --> 53:53.142
He told me that shit
'cause he ain't had no one.

53:53.186 --> 53:54.840
Just like I ain't go no...

53:54.883 --> 53:57.277
He told me that shit about
Ray 'cause he was scared.

53:57.321 --> 53:59.148
Hey.

53:59.192 --> 54:00.454
[Sky] That ain't
your fucking problem.

54:00.498 --> 54:01.760
-That's my boy!
-You got your own shit

54:01.803 --> 54:03.457
to deal with.

54:03.501 --> 54:05.894
Ray laying his hands
on him is my problem.

54:05.938 --> 54:08.549
His step-daddy touching
on him at night,

54:08.593 --> 54:11.770
then beating him down,
that is my fucking problem too.

54:13.162 --> 54:14.686
You know?

54:17.341 --> 54:19.908
You ain't supposed
to abandon your boy.

54:21.040 --> 54:22.781
And I did that.

54:22.824 --> 54:24.304
I did that.

54:25.740 --> 54:27.481
I got mad 'cause he was
doing better than me

54:27.525 --> 54:30.310
and whispered that shit to him.

54:30.354 --> 54:32.834
Ray teaching you something
new at night, huh?

54:34.749 --> 54:36.490
I told him that shit
like he wasn't nothing.

54:36.534 --> 54:38.187
Saying that shit in
front of the class

54:38.231 --> 54:39.928
all like it wasn't nothing.

54:39.972 --> 54:44.106
Knowing it was gonna hurt him,
knowing it's fucked up.

54:44.150 --> 54:45.934
And 'cause of you.

54:45.978 --> 54:47.327
You in my head telling
me to make a hard choice

54:47.371 --> 54:49.808
and to choose now,
but you ain't here.

54:49.851 --> 54:52.941
Just a stupid ass, fucked up
nobody that got run up on.

54:52.985 --> 54:54.943
They shot your ass, remember?

54:56.771 --> 54:59.034
You dead.

54:59.078 --> 55:01.167
I know, look I gotta go.

55:01.210 --> 55:02.908
Don't ever talk to me again.

55:02.951 --> 55:04.779
I'm not supposed
to be seeing you.

55:04.823 --> 55:06.520
You dead, Sky.

55:06.564 --> 55:09.958
"Some I love who are dead
were watchers of the moon."

55:10.002 --> 55:12.352
I can't even see you.

55:12.396 --> 55:16.400
"It shines tonight
upon their grave."

55:17.183 --> 55:18.576
You dead!

55:20.055 --> 55:22.362
They shot you, dead!

55:23.755 --> 55:25.104
Remember?

55:26.497 --> 55:27.628
Go!

55:27.672 --> 55:28.629
Go!

55:28.673 --> 55:30.370
Go!

55:30.979 --> 55:34.069
[dramatic music]

56:03.838 --> 56:06.928
[heavy breathing]

56:16.851 --> 56:19.463
[squeal echoes]

56:20.899 --> 56:24.468
First body's the hardest, Dai.

56:35.566 --> 56:41.572
