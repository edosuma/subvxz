00:09.375 --> 00:10.959
You gotta push it, Gary!

00:11.208 --> 00:13.625
Yeah, you heard him. Push it, Gary!

00:14.375 --> 00:18.208
Hey, someone's pretty studious
about their gluteus.

00:18.291 --> 00:19.834
A-plus, Gary.

00:21.208 --> 00:24.750
So, Joan, what do you think
of my new Wasabi Warrior Academy?

00:24.834 --> 00:26.917
Whoo-whee!

00:27.500 --> 00:28.542
Fancy.

00:29.750 --> 00:33.208
But I gotta be honest with you,
still smells like your old dojo.

00:33.291 --> 00:34.834
You know, cat vomit, sweat and...

00:35.166 --> 00:36.166
pickles.

00:36.959 --> 00:38.041
That's your sweater, Joan.

00:39.208 --> 00:40.291
Excuse me, Rudy.

00:40.375 --> 00:41.542
I am a lady.

00:41.625 --> 00:43.041
And I think I would know if my...

00:46.208 --> 00:47.000
Nope.

00:47.375 --> 00:48.250
Definitely your...

00:48.291 --> 00:49.792
...dojo.

00:53.291 --> 00:55.625
You see, the Warrior Academy
has something for everybody.

00:55.917 --> 00:58.750
But my favorite are these
resistance bands.

00:59.166 --> 01:01.291
They are a guaranteed way to get ripped.

01:05.208 --> 01:06.417

-

01:07.834 --> 01:10.250
Oh! Yep! Something ripped.

01:11.709 --> 01:15.542
Hey, Jerry. I just got an e-mail
from Kim at the Otai academy in Japan.

01:16.250 --> 01:17.375
What's it say?

01:25.208 --> 01:26.041
Oh.

01:26.625 --> 01:29.083
"Congratulations on opening your new dojo.

01:29.166 --> 01:30.542
Love and miss you, Kim."

01:30.625 --> 01:31.709
Aww.

01:32.959 --> 01:34.959
You know, I get Kim going to Otai.

01:35.041 --> 01:37.375
But why would Jack and Milton
sign up for summer school

01:37.458 --> 01:39.250
at the Biltmore Academy in Washington?

01:39.291 --> 01:42.083
Yeah, they're probably sitting
in some stuffy classroom right now

01:42.166 --> 01:43.834
just bored out of their skulls.

01:46.875 --> 01:48.250
Hey, Jack, what's your favorite part

01:48.333 --> 01:50.792
about working for the
government as an undercover spy?

01:50.875 --> 01:53.208
Uh, I'm gonna go with jetpacks.

01:55.375 --> 01:57.625
Whoo! Best summer ever!

02:01.500 --> 02:04.125
Jack, it happened again.
I'm gonna need a pickup.

02:53.375 --> 02:55.709
Well, gentlemen,
that was our last mission.

02:56.291 --> 02:58.041
With R.A.S.H. no longer a threat,

02:58.625 --> 02:59.792
there's no need for our team.

03:00.208 --> 03:02.792
Yeah, so I guess you and Milton
can go back to Seaford,

03:02.875 --> 03:04.125
put on your pajamas and, uh,

03:04.875 --> 03:05.917
kick stuff.

03:06.583 --> 03:07.750
Excuse me.

03:08.041 --> 03:10.625
What Jack and I do in our
pajamas is our business.

03:11.166 --> 03:12.792
We do nothing in our pajamas.

03:14.041 --> 03:16.834
As a going-away gift, I wanna present you
with these spy watches.

03:17.542 --> 03:20.709
If you push this button right here,
they become a high-powered magnet.

03:21.834 --> 03:23.583
Without an external energy source,

03:23.667 --> 03:24.792
it can't be that powerful.

03:28.542 --> 03:31.125
Oh! Yeah, no. It's pretty powerful.

03:36.041 --> 03:37.542
Where's my watch, sir?

03:37.750 --> 03:39.959
Ohh. Uh...

03:40.667 --> 03:41.834
I didn't get you watch, Shane.

03:42.458 --> 03:45.291
I got you...

03:46.875 --> 03:49.291
This pen!

03:51.333 --> 03:53.917
They get cool watches, and I just get
this dumb polar bear pen?

03:54.000 --> 03:55.375
It's not just a pen.

03:55.458 --> 03:57.834
Look what happens to the polar bear
when you turn it upside-down.

03:58.375 --> 04:00.083
Oh, nice! He's wearing a bikini.

04:01.208 --> 04:02.333
Ooh-la-la. Am I right?

04:02.417 --> 04:03.542
Yeah.

04:06.667 --> 04:08.834
Oh, yeah! It also has a laser.

04:09.333 --> 04:10.458
Forget the laser.

04:10.542 --> 04:12.375
This naughty bear is a riot.

04:15.667 --> 04:18.000
Guys, this is where we part ways.

04:19.500 --> 04:23.542
I just want to let you know that as
a military leader, I don't do emotion.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.166
It's a sign of weakness.

04:25.625 --> 04:27.291
It's best just to stay strong.

04:29.500 --> 04:30.750
It's just that...

04:43.917 --> 04:45.291
Way to stay strong, sir.

04:50.166 --> 04:53.166
I can't even tell you how good it
is to have you two back in Seaford.

04:53.542 --> 04:57.208
This place is amazing, but is there
any part of you that miss our old dojo?

04:57.291 --> 04:58.417
Boys,

04:58.500 --> 05:01.291
I want you to know that our old dojo
can never be replaced.

05:01.583 --> 05:03.834
We forged memories that
are gonna last a lifetime.

05:03.917 --> 05:05.208
I even had my first kiss there.

05:05.709 --> 05:07.959
Weren't you 27 when that place opened?

05:10.792 --> 05:13.041
Did I say first? I meant like 100th.

05:14.542 --> 05:16.125
So, how'd you get the money
for this place?

05:16.208 --> 05:18.000
I've always said you can achieve anything

05:18.083 --> 05:20.458
with hard work, discipline
and self sacrifice.

05:20.542 --> 05:21.834
So, what did you do?

05:21.917 --> 05:23.959
I went in on a lottery ticket with Phil.

05:25.166 --> 05:26.208
Okay.

05:26.291 --> 05:29.208
We need three matching animals
to win a million dollars.

05:30.750 --> 05:32.166
- Panda.
- Oh, nice.

05:33.542 --> 05:34.792
Panda!

05:37.667 --> 05:39.375
We won! It's a panda?

05:39.458 --> 05:42.166
No, it's a monkey.
But Phil loves the monkeys

05:44.417 --> 05:45.500
Oh.

05:45.917 --> 05:47.125
Look what fell out.

05:47.208 --> 05:48.291
What?

05:48.417 --> 05:50.291
That's the bolt that's
holding the safety bar in.

05:51.125 --> 05:53.166
- Oh, you mean... Oh! Uh-oh!
- Aah!

05:53.250 --> 05:55.166
- Oh, we're moving!
- Aah!

05:57.083 --> 05:59.750
The Ferris wheel company paid us a
lot of money so we wouldn't sue 'em.

06:00.208 --> 06:01.625
I used my money to open up this place,

06:01.709 --> 06:04.250
and Phil used his to open up
the business of his dreams.

06:04.875 --> 06:06.750
Hello! Welcome to Phil's Bowl and Burger.

06:06.834 --> 06:09.625
It's not food poisoning,
it's bowling fever

06:15.041 --> 06:16.166
Ugh.

06:23.625 --> 06:24.667
What's up, dude?

06:24.750 --> 06:26.417
What? Guys, you're back!

06:26.500 --> 06:28.041
- Here we are!
- Oh-ho!

06:28.125 --> 06:30.041
Wow, this place is awesome.

06:31.917 --> 06:32.834
Jerry!

06:33.208 --> 06:34.083

06:34.166 --> 06:35.291
What? Dude!

06:35.417 --> 06:37.417
No way! We missed you guys.

06:38.125 --> 06:39.792
Yo, you're not gonna believe it.

06:40.458 --> 06:41.709
I'm the new manager here.

06:43.083 --> 06:44.875
What do you know about managing
a bowling alley?

06:44.959 --> 06:46.083
Oh, a lot.

06:46.166 --> 06:48.333
In fact, I increased profit
by coming up with a way

06:48.417 --> 06:50.333
for people to play more games per hour.

06:50.583 --> 06:51.583
How'd you do that?

06:51.667 --> 06:52.792
I sped up the ball returns.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.542
That's just good managing, yo.

06:59.125 --> 07:00.166
Well.

07:00.250 --> 07:02.083
You guys enjoy yourselves.
I gotta get back to work.

07:03.583 --> 07:06.041
Hey, Jack, I just got a text
from Funderburk to call him.

07:06.125 --> 07:07.583
We just got back. Don't respond.

07:07.667 --> 07:09.458
I'm tired of teaching
him to program his DVR.

07:09.542 --> 07:11.125
To record "Dog Show Divas."

07:11.542 --> 07:12.834
He says it's an emergency.

07:27.583 --> 07:31.375
Oh, and the going on
is really going, bro-chacho.

07:31.458 --> 07:33.834
My bowling alley is the coolest

07:33.917 --> 07:36.291

08:05.000 --> 08:06.750

I'm the pinhead and this is splits Malone.

08:47.208 --> 08:48.417
Let's go.

08:52.250 --> 08:53.542
That was the mop closet.

Jack, Milton. I'm glad you made it.

09:25.583 --> 09:26.792
Shane, where's Funderburk?

09:26.875 --> 09:28.166
He was captured by R.A.S.H..

09:28.500 --> 09:30.291
There was one agent we didn't know about.

09:30.375 --> 09:32.834
Someone so secretive and so smart,

09:32.917 --> 09:35.875
he was able to fool everyone
by pretending to be one of us.

09:36.333 --> 09:37.625
A double agent.

09:38.166 --> 09:39.375
I'll bet it was Donovan.

It wasn't Donovan.

You know who it was? Kowalski!

09:42.667 --> 09:45.041
Oh, I can so see that. Classic Kowalski!

09:45.125 --> 09:46.166
It wasn't Kowalski.

09:46.250 --> 09:48.375
Got it! Judith from reception.

12:01.083 --> 12:02.250
Oh, hold up.

12:02.917 --> 12:03.959
I have to go...

12:04.417 --> 12:05.583
do some spy stuff.

12:11.417 --> 12:13.583
Once he hits that button,
there's no way to deactivate it.

12:13.667 --> 12:16.375
If we got that pen, we could
use the laser to cut the lock.

12:18.083 --> 12:19.917
We can get the pen by using
the magnet watch

12:20.000 --> 12:21.291
to bring over the metal garbage can.

12:21.375 --> 12:24.041
No, too complicated. I say we get
the pen by using the magnet watch

12:24.125 --> 12:25.500
to bring over the metal garbage can.

12:26.417 --> 12:27.709
That's what I just said.

12:27.792 --> 12:29.917
Now is not the time to be
taking credit for my ideas.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.125
Can we just do this, please?

12:34.250 --> 12:36.166
- If I aim it just right...
-

12:36.250 --> 12:37.583
- I can...
-

12:39.709 --> 12:41.291
- Good job.
- Wait, I got it.

12:41.875 --> 12:43.166
- Hurry.
- Okay.

12:44.417 --> 12:45.250
-
- Got it!

12:45.291 --> 12:46.542
Okay.

12:48.041 --> 12:49.041
-
- Ow.

12:50.291 --> 12:51.709
Do you have a metal plate in your head?

12:51.792 --> 12:52.750
No.

12:52.834 --> 12:54.375
Maybe. Why? What have you heard?

12:58.125 --> 12:59.875
<i>♪ Here we go, let's start the party ♪</i>

12:59.959 --> 13:02.000
<i>♪ Chop it up like it's karate ♪</i>

13:02.917 --> 13:06.250
If Jerry doesn't show up by two o'clock,
it's an automatic forfeit.

13:06.333 --> 13:08.250
And we get to bowl here forever.

13:10.208 --> 13:12.834
Nobody messes with the pinhead.

13:14.375 --> 13:15.542
Pinhead.

13:46.041 --> 13:48.000
- I'm surprised you showed up, Jerry.
-

13:48.166 --> 13:50.000
It's not Jerry. It's...

13:52.709 --> 13:53.875
"The Jerry."

13:55.917 --> 13:58.208
It's weird because you look a lot
like my friend Jerry.

14:00.291 --> 14:01.542
Do you think that you can beat...

14:01.834 --> 14:02.834
"The Rudy"?

14:06.041 --> 14:07.000
Ball!

14:28.125 --> 14:29.875
- Ho-ho-ho!
-

15:28.583 --> 15:30.959
He's only got one roll left.

15:31.041 --> 15:32.834
And the only way he can
win it is if he makes

15:32.917 --> 15:34.959
the impossible seven-10 split.

15:35.041 --> 15:36.709
He'll never make it!

15:38.709 --> 15:39.917
We're going to lose.

15:40.917 --> 15:42.083
My life is ruined.

15:42.333 --> 15:43.583
My business is ruined.

15:43.875 --> 15:45.291
All of my dreams are--

15:48.125 --> 15:49.709
Have faith in...

15:50.709 --> 15:51.792
The Jerry.

16:22.542 --> 16:23.709
We lost!

16:24.625 --> 16:25.625
Did we?

16:33.333 --> 16:35.250
He did it! He did it!

16:35.333 --> 16:37.000
He did it!

16:39.667 --> 16:41.583
Never doubt the Jerry.

16:42.834 --> 16:44.000
We lost, pinhead.

16:45.375 --> 16:46.291
We lost, but...

16:47.125 --> 16:48.667
We lost to a legend.

16:58.208 --> 16:59.375
See ya, pinhead.

17:09.959 --> 17:11.625
So, I said, "your beard
makes you look thinner."

17:11.709 --> 17:12.959
That seemed to cheer her right up.

17:15.709 --> 17:17.125
- Say goodbye, Jack!
-

17:19.083 --> 17:21.667
Twenty seconds after I push this
self-destruct button,

17:21.750 --> 17:23.834
you three are going to be a memory.

17:25.125 --> 17:28.083
<i>Your baked potato
will be ready in 20 seconds.</i>

17:30.291 --> 17:31.709
That's the microwave button.

17:33.208 --> 17:35.417
The self-destruct button is the brown one.

17:35.500 --> 17:36.709
Funderburk!

17:38.291 --> 17:41.041
<i>Self-destruction in 30 seconds.</i>

17:41.667 --> 17:43.667
<i>- Got it!
-</i>

17:44.375 --> 17:45.375
I got this.

18:18.041 --> 18:19.625
<i>Your baked potato is done.</i>

18:21.291 --> 18:23.500
<i>Self-destruction in 10 seconds.</i>

18:23.583 --> 18:25.208
Guys, the tunnel's the only way out.

18:35.333 --> 18:37.500
- No spud left behind!
-

18:46.166 --> 18:48.959
Hot, hot, hot!

18:49.583 --> 18:50.667
Jack, we gotta get out of here.

19:07.125 --> 19:08.500
Come on. Let's go.

19:09.333 --> 19:11.041
- Why are you saving me, Jack?
-

19:11.125 --> 19:12.500
Because it's the right thing to do.

19:12.750 --> 19:15.458
<i>Three, two... One.</i>

19:25.375 --> 19:27.166
Thanks to you, Shane and his men
have been captured.

19:27.917 --> 19:30.333
I can never repay you guys
for coming back and saving me.

19:30.375 --> 19:32.166
Aw, you don't have to repay us.

19:32.250 --> 19:33.291
We did it because we're friends.

19:33.375 --> 19:35.208
And you would have done
the same thing for us.

19:35.709 --> 19:36.917
Uh...

19:40.750 --> 19:42.750
Sure.

19:43.458 --> 19:44.542
Anyway...

19:45.208 --> 19:46.709
looks like our spy days are over.

19:50.625 --> 19:51.709
Hey, Funderburk.

19:53.792 --> 19:55.125
I saved this for you.

19:55.625 --> 19:58.000
My Angel's Kiss!

19:59.458 --> 20:01.917
Perfect timing. I gotta
go take care of some...

20:03.875 --> 20:05.125
spy stuff.

20:07.542 --> 20:09.125
-
- Hey, I'm, uh,

20:09.250 --> 20:11.000
getting pretty high up on this wall.

20:11.083 --> 20:12.125
You sure you got me?

20:12.208 --> 20:13.875
I said I got you, Rudy. Keep going.

20:13.959 --> 20:14.750
All right.

20:16.125 --> 20:17.166
I got a feeling...

20:18.291 --> 20:20.291
A feeling for ceiling!

20:21.125 --> 20:24.458
You know, Milton, I'm glad to
be back, but so much has changed.

20:24.917 --> 20:26.417
I wonder if it'll ever feel like home.

20:34.250 --> 20:35.500
You said you had me!

20:35.583 --> 20:36.583
I did have you!

20:36.667 --> 20:37.959
As long as you didn't fall.

20:38.375 --> 20:39.625
That's it!

20:39.709 --> 20:41.458
-
- Ow! Ow!

20:41.542 --> 20:43.333
Yeah, this is more like home.

20:43.417 --> 20:45.333
Aah!

20:45.625 --> 20:47.083
- Should we--
- Absolutely.

20:47.542 --> 20:48.834
Let's go bowling.

20:49.291 --> 20:50.583
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you ♪</i>

20:56.375 --> 20:58.625
I'm a pretty good bowler, huh, Jack?

20:58.709 --> 21:00.291
I almost beat you that second game.

21:00.417 --> 21:03.375
Yeah, you really found your
stride once you put the bumpers up.

21:05.917 --> 21:07.959
Ah, dude, I think I left
my spy watch in the dojo.

21:11.500 --> 21:14.458
Yo, guys, check out
this sick watch I found.

21:14.917 --> 21:16.417
Yeah, I don't know what this button does.

21:16.500 --> 21:18.333
- No, no, no, Jerry! Don't press that.
-

21:21.500 --> 21:22.709
- thumps )
-

21:24.417 --> 21:26.000
Do you have a metal plate in your head?

21:26.083 --> 21:27.709
No.

21:28.166 --> 21:29.667
Maybe. Why? What have you heard?

21:57.208 --> 21:58.125
<i>Poor soul.</i>

22:02.083 --> 22:02.917
<i>Yes!</i>
