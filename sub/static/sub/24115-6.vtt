WEBVTT

00:01.960 --> 00:03.599
This is only a casing,

00:03.760 --> 00:05.319
used to contain a Sentry.

00:05.520 --> 00:08.194
<i>Once the Sentry is out
of the shell, it seeks a host.</i>

00:10.560 --> 00:12.597
<i>Then uses that host
to gather information</i>

00:12.760 --> 00:14.274
<i>about whatever planet it's on.</i>

00:14.440 --> 00:16.320
Once it's gathered
all the information required,

00:16.520 --> 00:17.670
it uploads it to Brainiac,

00:17.840 --> 00:20.400
and leaves
the host body for dead.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.910
My mom's
not coming home, is she?

00:23.120 --> 00:24.634
No, sweetheart, she's not.

00:24.800 --> 00:26.280
Val, I'm headed your way...

00:26.440 --> 00:28.352
Tell me what you know
about Brainiac.

00:28.480 --> 00:30.312
- Who are you?
- I didn't bring you here

00:30.480 --> 00:31.596
to ask me questions.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.856
I need you to tell me
how to get us out of here.

00:36.880 --> 00:38.200
We go straight.

00:40.240 --> 00:41.833
Whoa, hey, friends, friends.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.959
This is a sacred place.
You do not belong here.

00:45.120 --> 00:46.952
Commander Zod,
it is by Rao's word

00:47.120 --> 00:48.952
that you are hereby charged
with treason.

00:49.120 --> 00:50.713
I have come
to make you an offer

00:50.880 --> 00:53.270
that could save Lyta's life.
For the cost of what?

00:53.400 --> 00:55.312
Pledge your support
for my father.

00:55.480 --> 00:58.678
What makes you think
Jayna is ready to join us

00:58.840 --> 01:01.309
and go against everything
House Zod stands for?

01:01.480 --> 01:03.119
Our plans rest
on Jayna's militarism...

01:03.280 --> 01:05.111
Oh, you think
I don't know that?

01:05.440 --> 01:07.272
Tell us where you took
that Cythonnite woman.

01:07.440 --> 01:09.909
She holds the key
to stopping Brainiac.

01:12.120 --> 01:13.120
Stay here.

01:21.280 --> 01:23.237
- Who gave you that?
- You did.

01:24.520 --> 01:25.520
I'm your son.

01:28.880 --> 01:32.510
You made me work for this
when I was just a boy.

01:33.640 --> 01:36.553
Then you put it
on me, and said,

01:37.120 --> 01:38.952
we kneel for no one.

01:39.160 --> 01:40.160
This...

01:41.440 --> 01:44.353
It can't be.
It's impossible.

01:47.600 --> 01:50.513
Don't listen to a goddamn
word this asshole says, Seg.

01:52.040 --> 01:54.350
- You know him?
- I know who he is.

01:54.520 --> 01:56.751
In my time,
we all know who he is.

01:58.240 --> 02:00.471
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

02:00.800 --> 02:02.029
General Zod.

02:02.640 --> 02:05.439
This son of a bitch
is Superman's greatest enemy.

02:05.680 --> 02:08.957
So trust me on this,
we need to kill him now.

02:29.640 --> 02:31.950
<i>Born from the void
of the universe,</i>

02:32.240 --> 02:34.072
<i>before time began,</i>

02:34.240 --> 02:38.473
Almighty Rao, who kindled
the sun and created all life,

02:38.640 --> 02:40.154
I submit to thee.

02:40.280 --> 02:43.910
What makes you think
Rao created all life?

02:44.280 --> 02:47.239
Because I have faith.

02:47.760 --> 02:49.877
My mother told me
faith's a journey

02:50.040 --> 02:54.831
that begins in hope and ends in
belief of what you can't see,

02:55.000 --> 02:56.559
but know to be true.

02:57.120 --> 02:59.510
Or it could
be considered a delusion.

02:59.960 --> 03:04.557
The sign of a species
not given to clear thought.

03:10.760 --> 03:12.160
Is this a test?

03:13.560 --> 03:14.596
Yes.

03:15.040 --> 03:17.236
Do you think my faith
isn't strong enough?

03:17.440 --> 03:18.954
What are you testing?

03:25.800 --> 03:27.280
Your worthiness.

03:27.760 --> 03:31.071
Your city's, your world's.

03:31.640 --> 03:34.633
Do you deserve eternal life?

03:35.560 --> 03:37.597
What happens
to those who aren't worthy?

03:41.080 --> 03:44.960
I think you know the opposite
of eternal life, Ona.

04:01.480 --> 04:03.836
Killing a man directly
runs the risk of witnesses.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.311
A bomb, though, that can
be attributed to anyone.

04:07.520 --> 04:10.797
Tonight, the Voice of Rao
closes the Nova Cycle festival

04:10.960 --> 04:13.270
with the Ascension Ceremony
at the Hall of Justice.

04:13.680 --> 04:16.752
It's private, so there will
be minimal collateral damage

04:16.920 --> 04:18.639
and we can rig the explosive
ahead of time.

04:19.120 --> 04:20.440
I hope you've
chosen your support

04:20.600 --> 04:22.956
among the Guilded carefully.

04:23.320 --> 04:25.915
Oh, we know who will back us
when the time comes.

04:26.320 --> 04:28.880
- What about you?
- There's only one left

04:29.080 --> 04:30.833
to complete the team.
Commander Dev-Em.

04:31.120 --> 04:33.430
He's used to working with
the Voice's security detail,

04:33.600 --> 04:35.353
and the Voice is used to him.

04:35.600 --> 04:37.353
How sure are you
that he'll commit?

04:37.960 --> 04:39.952
The Ems are
a traditional house.

04:40.120 --> 04:41.839
Dev goes through
the motions of Raoism,

04:41.960 --> 04:43.136
but it's not
where his heart lies.

04:43.160 --> 04:44.389
That's with my daughter.

04:44.560 --> 04:46.916
As for his loyalty,
that's with me.

04:47.040 --> 04:49.874
- I hope you're right.
- And I hope you're ready.

04:58.280 --> 05:00.749
Come now, you're obviously
not built for this.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.240
You're only resting
that weapon on my chest

05:03.280 --> 05:04.680
to stop your hands
from shaking.

05:05.640 --> 05:07.199
Go on, say one more word.

05:07.520 --> 05:09.432
And you'll see exactly
what I'm built for.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.160
All right, all right.
Just take it easy.

05:11.720 --> 05:14.554
- And start explaining.
- This sorry bastard

05:14.720 --> 05:17.030
has travelled
back through time to get here.

05:17.520 --> 05:20.672
I don't know how,
but it's not hard to see why.

05:21.160 --> 05:24.039
He's obviously working with
Brainiac to destroy Krypton.

05:25.080 --> 05:26.799
Why would I
destroy our world?

05:27.240 --> 05:28.515
I'm here to save Krypton.

05:29.400 --> 05:30.560
Oh, so it's
just a coincidence

05:30.680 --> 05:32.319
you're here at the
same time as Brainiac?

05:32.560 --> 05:34.438
Of course not.
History tells us this

05:34.640 --> 05:36.200
is when that creature
ripped Kandor City

05:36.360 --> 05:39.034
away from the planet and
made it part of his collection.

05:39.240 --> 05:41.038
I'm here to
prevent that tragedy.

05:41.200 --> 05:44.750
I'm confused,
you're saying that Brainiac

05:44.920 --> 05:45.920
isn't from the future?

05:46.000 --> 05:47.434
That's exactly
what I'm saying.

05:47.640 --> 05:50.439
Brainiac didn't travel through
time to launch this attack.

05:50.760 --> 05:52.160
This is what he's always done.

05:55.240 --> 05:56.240
No, that...

05:57.280 --> 05:59.158
That can't be right.

06:01.400 --> 06:03.631
It's elementary
Kryptonian history.

06:03.800 --> 06:06.190
The beginning of the end
for our civilization.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.359
Brainiac takes Kandor City,

06:08.520 --> 06:10.830
which destabilizes
Krypton's core.

06:11.640 --> 06:14.109
Causing the planet
to explode in 200 years.

06:16.920 --> 06:19.480
The planet explodes
in 200 years?

06:21.080 --> 06:23.470
That, that, that's insane.

06:24.240 --> 06:26.471
- That's insane.
- Wait.

06:27.480 --> 06:29.551
Your friend here
didn't mention that?

06:35.560 --> 06:36.960
It's true, isn't it?

06:39.120 --> 06:40.270
That's not the point.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.196
This whole time,
you knew and you said noth...

06:43.360 --> 06:44.840
Seg, you cannot
trust this man.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.320
Oh, so he's lying?

06:46.480 --> 06:47.914
But you've confirmed
he's a Zod,

06:48.080 --> 06:50.470
and he's from your time...
And if he's really your son,

06:50.680 --> 06:53.354
then I'm sorry,
but believing anything he says

06:53.520 --> 06:56.558
is a mistake.
You got to trust me on this.

06:56.840 --> 06:58.115
He's here to destroy Krypton,

06:58.280 --> 06:59.953
and make sure
Superman is never born.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.874
No Zod would ever
destroy Krypton.

07:03.480 --> 07:08.600
It's our duty to
defend our city, and our world.

07:09.160 --> 07:11.834
Our duty, and...

07:12.080 --> 07:13.833
Our proud privilege.

07:16.240 --> 07:19.233
Oh, this is some grade-A,
premium bullshit.

07:19.440 --> 07:20.476
Seg.

07:21.960 --> 07:24.475
You know you can trust me,
don't you?

07:30.040 --> 07:31.076
Well?

07:33.760 --> 07:34.989
Hey, man.

07:55.920 --> 07:56.920
Cuff them both.

07:57.120 --> 07:58.120
Come on.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.200
Seg...

08:01.480 --> 08:03.437
Oh, I think there's
some explaining to be done.

08:14.400 --> 08:15.400
All right.

08:16.320 --> 08:17.320
You first.

08:18.400 --> 08:19.880
You said you're here
to stop Brainiac,

08:19.920 --> 08:23.152
that you've studied him.
Let's hear the plan.

08:23.320 --> 08:24.520
Firstly,
you have to understand

08:24.560 --> 08:26.552
that Brainiac
is virtually immortal.

08:26.720 --> 08:28.359
Existing for
thousands of years.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.112
He possesses
the intellectual plunder

08:31.320 --> 08:33.835
of countless
advanced civilizations.

08:33.960 --> 08:34.960
He's far beyond us.

08:35.760 --> 08:39.116
And as history has proven,
Krypton's current weapons

08:39.400 --> 08:42.438
- are useless against him.
- Yet here you are.

08:42.799 --> 08:45.838
And we still haven't
heard a plan yet, General.

08:46.480 --> 08:48.199
That's because
he doesn't have one.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.151
On account of
he's full of shit.

08:51.400 --> 08:55.360
When Brainiac took Kandor,
both our families made it out.

08:55.720 --> 08:57.359
They made their way
to Kryptonopolis.

08:57.640 --> 08:58.994
In that city's
ancient archives,

08:59.160 --> 09:02.437
I learned of the location
of a hidden weapon.

09:02.640 --> 09:06.953
A pre-cataclysm instrument
of violence so powerful,

09:07.240 --> 09:09.471
it would give
even Brainiac pause.

09:09.640 --> 09:11.313
That's why
your base is down here?

09:11.880 --> 09:14.236
I've been searching
these catacombs for months.

09:14.440 --> 09:15.590
With only one clue.

09:17.120 --> 09:18.120
Inside pocket.

09:24.920 --> 09:26.513
Don't come crying to me

09:26.680 --> 09:28.376
if he's hiding some kind of
freaky ass space spider

09:28.400 --> 09:29.880
in there that
bites your hand off.

09:31.120 --> 09:32.120
Just saying.

09:40.520 --> 09:41.954
According to the archive,

09:42.120 --> 09:45.033
we find that symbol,
we find the weapon.

09:51.160 --> 09:53.629
It looks like a house sigil.

09:53.800 --> 09:56.156
It doesn't match
any house currently on Krypton.

10:00.640 --> 10:01.640
You recognize it.

10:03.120 --> 10:04.554
All you have to do
is take me there.

10:05.120 --> 10:06.918
- Seg, you can't...
- Shut up.

10:07.880 --> 10:09.234
You'll have your turn.

10:10.800 --> 10:13.634
The people who live down here,
the Cythonnites.

10:14.080 --> 10:17.471
This weapon is what they're
sworn to protect, isn't it?

10:17.640 --> 10:20.792
Yes, and they will guard it
with their lives.

10:20.960 --> 10:23.191
Because that is
how powerful it is.

10:23.360 --> 10:25.079
Which is why we need it.

10:38.160 --> 10:40.959
I received a message.
You wanted to see me?

10:41.200 --> 10:43.635
Commander Em, sit down.

10:49.120 --> 10:51.510
What I need to say to you,

10:52.320 --> 10:55.392
I say because I trust you, Dev.

10:55.600 --> 10:58.752
Thank you, Primus.
That means a lot.

11:00.240 --> 11:03.039
The Rankless Initiative.
That was shit, wasn't it.

11:04.840 --> 11:06.399
Complete shit.

11:06.840 --> 11:09.275
It only made things worse,
and Lyta didn't deserve

11:09.480 --> 11:12.951
to be made a scapegoat for the
Council's bad decisions.

11:13.120 --> 11:15.032
Over your lifetime,
would you say things

11:15.200 --> 11:17.032
have gotten better in Kandor?

11:17.400 --> 11:20.154
No, I wouldn't.

11:20.360 --> 11:22.591
But there is nothing
we can do about it.

11:22.760 --> 11:25.912
We are Sagitari.
We don't make policy.

11:27.240 --> 11:29.630
What if I told you
there are some

11:29.800 --> 11:34.317
who would like to see
a change in who makes policy?

11:34.480 --> 11:37.279
And the person
they'd want to change out?

11:43.320 --> 11:45.755
The Voice of Rao.

11:50.560 --> 11:51.994
You've committed to this?

11:55.880 --> 11:58.839
Just by my being here,

11:59.000 --> 12:00.753
being here
and not turning you in,

12:00.920 --> 12:01.956
I'm committed.

12:04.400 --> 12:05.400
Are you?

12:06.120 --> 12:09.431
You could still walk out
and call officers to arrest me.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.519
Would you let me do that?

12:11.680 --> 12:13.319
We could find out.

12:14.680 --> 12:15.796
No need.

12:16.680 --> 12:20.799
Everything I learned
about being a Sagitari

12:20.960 --> 12:22.997
was by following your lead.

12:24.200 --> 12:27.716
If you ask it of me,
I'll back you.

12:28.600 --> 12:29.636
All the way.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.037
<i>You guys can't
seriously be considering</i>

12:38.200 --> 12:40.920
giving this wackjob
a weapon of mass destruction.

12:43.920 --> 12:44.920
Seg.

12:45.760 --> 12:48.480
I'm sorry.
Really, I am.

12:49.880 --> 12:51.256
I know I should have
told you before,

12:51.280 --> 12:54.079
but what was I supposed to say?

12:54.240 --> 12:55.640
Hey, man, let's go get a drink.

12:55.760 --> 12:57.717
By the way, your world's
going to explode.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.753
Why even lay
that burden on you?

12:59.960 --> 13:01.519
Wouldn't you want to know?

13:06.400 --> 13:07.516
All right.

13:08.960 --> 13:11.156
I didn't tell you
because it was hard.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.959
It's not a conversation
anyone wants to have.

13:15.600 --> 13:17.273
Look, I don't, I don't know.

13:18.760 --> 13:20.638
Maybe Zod's lying.
Maybe...

13:22.560 --> 13:23.835
Maybe I was wrong.

13:26.640 --> 13:29.235
All I knew was
Superman's enemy was going back

13:29.400 --> 13:30.936
to change the timeline,
which means that

13:30.960 --> 13:32.599
your grandson
would never be born.

13:32.760 --> 13:35.070
So you're telling me
you didn't even hear

13:35.240 --> 13:38.438
the full story, but you
came to me, so sure of yours...

13:38.600 --> 13:40.831
I had to.
I couldn't just stand around

13:40.960 --> 13:42.416
and do nothing
if it meant no Superman.

13:42.440 --> 13:44.272
Regardless of
what you got wrong,

13:44.880 --> 13:48.078
Brainiac is still coming.
We can all agree on that.

13:48.240 --> 13:51.119
We all want to stop him,
so why don't we work together?

13:54.280 --> 13:57.990
Because,
if the warning I received

13:58.560 --> 14:01.359
wasn't about Brainiac,
it must have been about Zod.

14:01.960 --> 14:04.475
And if we're
to preserve the timeline,

14:04.800 --> 14:06.996
maybe we have to step back,
and let...

14:10.880 --> 14:12.712
Let Brainiac take Kandor.

14:20.160 --> 14:24.154
<i>In honor of the Nova Cycle,
by Rao's mercy,</i>

14:24.320 --> 14:26.880
your wrongdoing is pardoned.

14:27.480 --> 14:31.633
Go, meditate on your sins,
and perfect yourself.

14:33.680 --> 14:37.196
In honor of the Nova Cycle,
by Rao's mercy,

14:37.360 --> 14:39.636
your wrongdoing is pardoned.

14:39.840 --> 14:44.039
Go, meditate on your sins,
and perfect yourself.

14:46.320 --> 14:49.597
In honor of the Nova Cycle,
by Rao's mercy,

14:49.800 --> 14:51.917
your wrongdoing is pardoned.

14:52.080 --> 14:56.632
Go, meditate on your sins,
and perfect yourself.

14:57.040 --> 15:00.954
In honor of the Nova Cycle,
by Rao's mercy,

15:01.200 --> 15:02.714
your wrongdoing is pardoned.

15:14.600 --> 15:16.671
There must be some mistake.

15:19.040 --> 15:20.759
A late addition
to the list of pardons.

15:21.480 --> 15:24.234
- I see nothing wrong.
- But Commander.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.232
It says he's Black Zero.
He's a bomb maker.

15:26.480 --> 15:27.994
- Is something wrong?
- Excuse me,

15:28.200 --> 15:30.556
but there's been an error.
Zeroes are never pardoned.

15:30.720 --> 15:32.552
Rao's mercy is infinite.

15:33.080 --> 15:34.920
If His Eminence sees
something in this prisoner

15:35.040 --> 15:36.918
that we do not,
it is not for us to question.

15:37.120 --> 15:38.360
But shouldn't
we follow this up?

15:38.520 --> 15:39.920
- Make sure...
- Lieutenant.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.072
You're aware
that the Rankless Initiative

15:42.240 --> 15:44.152
created an ill feeling
in the city.

15:44.280 --> 15:45.856
There are those
who think the authorities

15:45.880 --> 15:47.553
are obsessed with Black Zero.

15:49.360 --> 15:50.760
This is a chance
for us to show them

15:50.880 --> 15:53.952
that Rao sees us all
as his children.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.077
Let it go, Lieutenant Ran.

15:56.760 --> 15:59.229
The politics
are above our pay grade.

16:00.200 --> 16:02.237
Commander Em,
there's a lot of animosity

16:02.400 --> 16:04.676
towards Black Zero,
understandably.

16:05.160 --> 16:06.696
Perhaps you could
accompany this prisoner

16:06.720 --> 16:08.837
safely out of the building.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.791
He's clearly insane, Seg.

16:21.640 --> 16:24.394
Come on, don't waste another
moment thinking about him.

16:24.960 --> 16:27.316
Seg, I know how
this sounds, but please.

16:28.880 --> 16:30.792
This is a key moment
in history.

16:30.960 --> 16:33.839
Things need to unfold the way
that they originally did.

16:34.040 --> 16:35.759
Okay, any changes
could set off history

16:35.920 --> 16:38.594
in some new and crazy way,
and something huge,

16:38.760 --> 16:41.275
like stopping Brainiac,

16:41.440 --> 16:43.113
that could ruin everything.

16:43.320 --> 16:46.631
By everything,
you mean my grandson.

16:46.840 --> 16:47.876
Your obsession.

16:50.520 --> 16:53.991
Tell me, how is it
that my world goes extinct,

16:54.400 --> 16:55.993
but he ends up on yours?

17:02.320 --> 17:05.472
He was sent off just before
this planet exploded.

17:07.319 --> 17:09.516
That's why he's called
the Last Son of Krypton.

17:11.720 --> 17:13.598
I don't have
all the answers here.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.116
I admit it.

17:16.760 --> 17:17.796
I guess if...

17:18.920 --> 17:20.991
If Brainiac
doesn't take Kandor,

17:21.160 --> 17:25.279
if Krypton doesn't explode,
then anything can happen.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.879
And maybe Kal-El will exist.
Maybe he won't.

17:29.800 --> 17:33.191
But what I do know is that is a
risk we cannot afford to take.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.696
One might argue
that the millions of lives

17:35.720 --> 17:36.551
on Krypton are more important

17:36.720 --> 17:38.120
than one immature survivor
on Earth.

17:38.240 --> 17:39.536
And one might argue
how many times

17:39.560 --> 17:41.870
Superman saves the universe,
if you want to count numbers.

17:42.080 --> 17:43.639
Forget the numbers!

17:44.520 --> 17:46.637
I care about my world.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.200
My friends.

17:49.120 --> 17:51.476
What's the point of any of it?

17:51.920 --> 17:54.071
Of making the world
a better place?

17:55.360 --> 17:58.558
Of having children?
Of protecting our loved ones?

17:59.120 --> 18:01.032
If it all just ends

18:01.240 --> 18:03.994
in fire and death?

18:04.520 --> 18:06.955
Everything that we are.

18:07.840 --> 18:09.513
Everything we've built.

18:10.640 --> 18:11.960
You're asking me

18:12.560 --> 18:15.632
to sacrifice all of it.

18:15.800 --> 18:17.029
For an idea.

18:18.480 --> 18:19.880
An abstraction.

18:20.640 --> 18:23.599
A future if.

18:24.760 --> 18:25.760
Seg...

18:27.600 --> 18:28.600
Please.

18:29.800 --> 18:33.635
This is the most important
moment in all of our lives.

18:35.520 --> 18:37.320
I know that I've given you
reason to doubt me,

18:37.440 --> 18:38.635
and I'm sorry.

18:40.040 --> 18:42.680
But I'm asking you
to put that aside right now.

18:45.120 --> 18:47.396
I'm asking you to trust me.

19:02.520 --> 19:04.637
- Keep both eyes on him.
- He's not to be trusted.

19:04.840 --> 19:05.840
Copy that.

19:25.720 --> 19:27.837
When we met,

19:29.040 --> 19:30.679
you said you knew my family.

19:30.840 --> 19:32.957
I counted your son
as my closest friend.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.196
It's true I disapproved
of your grandson.

19:36.800 --> 19:37.800
Why?

19:39.320 --> 19:40.896
There are immigrants
who turn their backs

19:40.920 --> 19:42.354
on their history
and their culture.

19:42.880 --> 19:45.000
Passively accept the standards
their new world offers,

19:45.200 --> 19:47.669
as though no others
could possibly exist.

19:50.040 --> 19:52.509
He let himself
be cut down to size.

19:57.240 --> 20:00.677
He was proud of it.
Proud of burying his heritage.

20:01.320 --> 20:04.791
I'm sorry, but your friend was
right about one thing at least.

20:05.040 --> 20:06.076
We were enemies.

20:06.240 --> 20:09.995
Though I take no pleasure
in that, and never have.

20:24.480 --> 20:27.552
Why is faith
important to you?

20:28.280 --> 20:30.954
It means that
everything has a purpose.

20:31.200 --> 20:32.759
That the purpose is good.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.318
That I'll see
my mother again one day.

20:35.760 --> 20:38.320
It's faith that leads us
to the Blessed Place.

20:38.640 --> 20:43.032
Is that important to you,
Little Sundrop?

20:45.320 --> 20:47.551
How did you know
my mother called me that?

20:48.160 --> 20:52.712
A few of the worthy,
the special ones,

20:52.880 --> 20:54.951
I take into myself.

20:55.120 --> 20:59.672
I take their memories,
skills, dreams.

20:59.840 --> 21:02.992
Everything that
makes them what they are.

21:03.720 --> 21:07.236
Their template lives forever

21:08.160 --> 21:09.640
in me.

21:10.080 --> 21:13.278
A template, that's a soul?

21:13.720 --> 21:16.280
Your mother is here in me.

21:16.600 --> 21:17.716
You could join her.

21:18.600 --> 21:23.880
Together forever.
Would you choose that?

21:25.840 --> 21:28.833
Sevi, why are you afraid?
What's wrong?

21:29.000 --> 21:32.038
Sevi has nothing
to be afraid of.

21:32.200 --> 21:34.715
She's answered
her questions well,

21:35.120 --> 21:38.272
and been promised eternal life.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.357
Sevi, that's wonderful,
isn't it?

21:43.160 --> 21:45.629
Yes, I'm so happy.

21:46.280 --> 21:50.479
Your choice will determine
your fate for eternity.

21:52.160 --> 21:55.153
Take time to consider it well.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.878
He's been asking questions.

22:03.200 --> 22:04.919
Wondering why
the last minute pardon

22:05.080 --> 22:07.436
for a Black Zero bomb maker.

22:07.600 --> 22:10.354
Noting that the prisoner hasn't
returned to his dwelling,

22:10.520 --> 22:13.115
or been seen in the city
since his release.

22:13.280 --> 22:15.670
Of course not,
he's in a Rankless safe house

22:15.840 --> 22:17.638
under guard, waiting
to be found and arrested

22:17.800 --> 22:20.040
for the Voice's death, and
killed while avoiding capture.

22:20.200 --> 22:22.715
What good does that do us
when one of your officers

22:22.840 --> 22:26.277
is encouraging people to
scrutinize the chain of events?

22:26.760 --> 22:30.151
He's from a prominent family.
People might listen to him.

22:30.360 --> 22:32.480
Couldn't you have replaced him
with one of our people?

22:32.640 --> 22:34.711
I already slipped Dev in.

22:34.960 --> 22:36.599
If you want
to attract suspicion,

22:36.760 --> 22:39.229
a good way to do it would be
to shift assignments around

22:39.400 --> 22:41.551
just before an assassination.

22:41.720 --> 22:43.712
Most officers wouldn't
have questioned the order.

22:43.920 --> 22:45.416
We were unlucky.
You need to silence him,

22:45.440 --> 22:47.352
quickly, before
he draws attention.

22:49.240 --> 22:51.835
Well, it's too late
to bring him on board now.

22:52.040 --> 22:53.056
And any attempt to scare him

22:53.080 --> 22:54.753
would only deepen
his suspicion further.

22:54.920 --> 22:56.256
No, there is only
one way to handle this.

22:56.280 --> 22:57.839
- I'll speak to him.
- No, don't...

22:58.000 --> 23:00.799
I do not need to be
schooled on the danger here.

23:01.760 --> 23:05.071
The lives of every Sagitari
I've recruited are in my hands,

23:05.240 --> 23:07.480
and they've put them there
because they have faith in me.

23:07.640 --> 23:09.711
If I'm committed,
they're willing to back me.

23:10.920 --> 23:13.355
What are you committed to,
except yourself?

23:13.520 --> 23:15.273
You've only ever
been out for number one.

23:15.480 --> 23:17.392
Am I supposed
to justify myself to you?

23:17.560 --> 23:19.756
Two decades ago,
you came out of nowhere,

23:20.000 --> 23:22.993
and married into House Vex,
and spent the rest of your life

23:23.120 --> 23:25.476
trying to make
the Vex name seem important.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.995
My honor,
that's my own problem.

23:29.160 --> 23:31.152
But what did
I sacrifice it for?

23:31.280 --> 23:33.636
And am I supposed
to kill a junior officer

23:33.840 --> 23:35.752
- to prop up your ego?
- My ego?

23:37.040 --> 23:38.176
You take a good look
at this city

23:38.200 --> 23:40.556
that you are
supposedly protecting, Jayna.

23:40.800 --> 23:42.359
Kandor is stagnating.

23:43.120 --> 23:45.954
We are barely surviving
on our dwindling resources.

23:46.720 --> 23:48.951
It is time
to look to the future.

23:49.120 --> 23:52.238
To look beyond, and start
to build new alliances

23:52.400 --> 23:53.959
with the eight other cities.

23:54.160 --> 23:57.312
To combine our expertise,
and develop new resources.

23:57.920 --> 24:00.389
If the other,
more illustrious houses

24:00.560 --> 24:04.634
are too hidebound
to do it, I am not.

24:04.800 --> 24:09.272
This world will only improve
when our cities work together.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.835
Under your leadership?

24:16.240 --> 24:17.515
You know, you're right.

24:18.920 --> 24:20.877
I do look out for number one.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.714
But the people
of Kandor are number two.

24:26.400 --> 24:27.993
Where do you
suppose they feature

24:28.160 --> 24:29.674
on the Voice of Rao's list?

24:31.280 --> 24:33.556
He only cares about the
glorification of his god,

24:33.760 --> 24:37.197
and he expects the people
to dedicate themselves to that.

24:37.880 --> 24:42.113
At least from me, they get
a chance at a decent life.

24:43.160 --> 24:45.231
I am a selfish bastard, Jayna.

24:45.840 --> 24:48.833
But people do things
for more than one reason.

25:03.200 --> 25:04.839
Everything all right,
Lieutenant?

25:05.840 --> 25:06.910
I don't know.

25:07.960 --> 25:09.633
The bomb maker who was freed.

25:10.200 --> 25:12.795
Why pardon someone
with such lethal expertise?

25:13.560 --> 25:15.376
I feel I should seek
an audience with the Voice.

25:15.400 --> 25:18.438
- Ask what he meant by it.
- I'd advise against that.

25:18.640 --> 25:20.552
You'd be implying the Voice
made a bad decision,

25:20.720 --> 25:22.393
and that's never a good idea,
career-wise.

25:22.560 --> 25:23.789
I get that, but...

25:25.080 --> 25:26.799
Did you know
the prisoner vanished?

25:28.000 --> 25:30.356
The whole thing feels wrong,
don't you think?

25:33.080 --> 25:34.514
You could be on to something.

25:35.080 --> 25:37.436
Let's find somewhere
to talk it over, figure it out.

25:39.560 --> 25:42.029
That's okay.
You're right.

25:42.240 --> 25:43.754
I probably should
stay out of it.

25:44.160 --> 25:45.160
It's no trouble.

25:46.320 --> 25:48.232
- I've got the time.
- No.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.599
Thank you, Commander Em.

25:51.400 --> 25:52.595
It's really okay.

25:59.920 --> 26:02.151
Oh, I hate to say this,
but I got to pee.

26:02.680 --> 26:04.160
So unless you want
to hold it for me,

26:04.320 --> 26:06.312
you're going to have
to unlock me for a moment.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.955
Real soon.

26:09.120 --> 26:11.351
I'll take the third option,
which is ignoring you.

26:30.800 --> 26:32.996
Hey, wait, wait, wait,
I've got something to tell you

26:33.160 --> 26:34.799
about the weapon
that you're guarding.

26:40.400 --> 26:42.915
The prisoner was only added
to the list at the last second.

26:43.120 --> 26:45.316
And no one can tell me
where the order came from.

26:45.680 --> 26:47.558
He was last seen
with Commander Em.

26:47.720 --> 26:49.996
Since then, he's disappeared
from the city.

26:50.200 --> 26:53.113
You were right to come to me
with this, Lieutenant Ran.

26:53.280 --> 26:54.999
I feel I should
also tell you,

26:55.200 --> 26:57.556
I've requested an audience
with the Voice of Rao.

27:06.600 --> 27:09.479
You are a fine officer.

27:15.160 --> 27:17.277
You have
your commander's praise.

28:09.760 --> 28:11.717
I have a million questions.

28:11.960 --> 28:12.960
Yes?

28:13.360 --> 28:15.216
Aren't you afraid
revealing things to your mother

28:15.240 --> 28:17.072
might mess up your timeline?

28:17.240 --> 28:19.197
A man who travels
into the past to change things

28:19.360 --> 28:21.477
is in no position to be picky.

28:21.760 --> 28:23.035
Very true.

28:25.400 --> 28:26.880
It's amazing
to see you like this.

28:27.040 --> 28:30.317
- Young?
- Happy, open.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
Smiling.

28:32.760 --> 28:35.229
What I remember most
about you was how heavy

28:35.440 --> 28:37.750
the loss of Kandor
weighed on your heart.

28:38.600 --> 28:40.512
You didn't like
to talk about it,

28:40.720 --> 28:43.030
but I learned that you were
in one of the military vessels

28:43.240 --> 28:44.879
attacking Brainiac's ship

28:45.560 --> 28:48.280
when he ripped
the city from the ground.

28:49.560 --> 28:52.029
You never forgot your failure
to defend the city.

28:52.200 --> 28:53.316
It made you bitter.

28:54.880 --> 28:57.714
I guess you're saying
I'm not a perfect mother.

28:57.920 --> 29:00.037
Maybe, but you taught me

29:00.520 --> 29:02.989
to put the defense
of this world above all else.

29:03.960 --> 29:06.156
You fashioned me into a weapon.

29:07.360 --> 29:08.714
I take pride in that.

29:21.720 --> 29:22.720
What was he telling you?

29:23.360 --> 29:25.113
Apparently, one day,
I wake up to find

29:25.360 --> 29:26.760
I've turned into my mother.

29:27.080 --> 29:29.993
Well, it seems I have
a grandson

29:30.440 --> 29:34.400
who's decisions are morally
dubious, so there's that.

29:35.160 --> 29:36.958
Can't help but worry, though.

29:40.080 --> 29:41.080
Our future?

29:42.840 --> 29:46.516
I have a son who
recognizes me as his mother,

29:46.640 --> 29:49.155
but only knows you as the
father of his best friend.

29:51.720 --> 29:53.279
I suppose I thought...

29:54.400 --> 29:56.676
Now that you're Guilded,
maybe there'd be a way.

29:57.680 --> 30:00.275
I still want to believe
we have a future.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.513
Let's stick with today.

30:11.280 --> 30:14.910
We already know
the future is confusing.

30:20.400 --> 30:22.153
Hold.

30:23.560 --> 30:25.836
- What is it?
- I heard something.

30:55.920 --> 30:57.400
Glad we're on the same side.

30:57.840 --> 30:59.991
Not bad for
a bitter old lady.

31:05.320 --> 31:06.834
The prisoner's
given up the location

31:07.000 --> 31:08.559
of his bomb-making equipment,

31:08.800 --> 31:10.120
and I've put
the finishing touches

31:10.240 --> 31:11.515
on one of his creations.

31:11.680 --> 31:14.275
Did you remove
all remote detonators?

31:14.440 --> 31:17.399
<i>Yes, there's nothing
that's traceable back to us.</i>

31:17.600 --> 31:20.195
<i>Once the timer's set,
nothing can stop it.</i>

31:20.360 --> 31:23.000
And no one can point a finger
at anyone else but Black Zero.

31:23.160 --> 31:26.437
<i>And the rogue officer
asking all the questions.</i>

31:26.600 --> 31:27.829
Has he been...

31:28.800 --> 31:29.836
dealt with?

31:31.440 --> 31:33.830
- Yes.
<i>- Good.</i>

31:35.000 --> 31:37.720
Then please feel free
to conceal your bomb

31:38.400 --> 31:40.471
in the Tribunal, Commander.

32:01.400 --> 32:03.198
Have you decided, Ona?

32:03.560 --> 32:05.870
Are you ready
to give yourself over now,

32:06.120 --> 32:07.918
and join your mother?

32:08.600 --> 32:10.398
That's not what I've chosen.

32:11.440 --> 32:13.113
I want to serve you here.

32:13.640 --> 32:15.757
You are a surprising child.

32:15.960 --> 32:17.110
I'm sorry.

32:19.120 --> 32:22.079
One gets tired
of always being right.

32:26.280 --> 32:29.796
I think I like surprises.

32:42.040 --> 32:43.269
Perhaps it's time you saw

32:43.480 --> 32:45.949
who it is you've vowed
to serve.

32:51.880 --> 32:54.111
Your Eminence, we're here
to escort you to the ceremony.

32:54.720 --> 32:56.791
There will be a slight delay.

32:56.960 --> 32:58.080
In speaking with my protÃ©gÃ©,

32:58.240 --> 33:00.197
I've realized
I need more contact

33:00.360 --> 33:01.680
with the people of Kandor.

33:01.840 --> 33:03.320
I have much to learn

33:03.480 --> 33:06.279
and to judge.

33:06.440 --> 33:08.272
I don't understand,
Your Eminence.

33:08.840 --> 33:11.116
The ceremony
must be open to the public.

33:11.320 --> 33:14.040
I want the hall packed
with citizens.

33:14.200 --> 33:16.112
Young, old, Guilded, Rankless.

33:16.280 --> 33:18.715
Turn no one away.

33:19.240 --> 33:21.197
Your Eminence,
I'm not sure we can

33:21.360 --> 33:22.999
get the people there in time.

33:23.360 --> 33:25.352
Then begin now.

33:37.320 --> 33:38.515
Thank you, Seg.

33:39.560 --> 33:43.349
If you hadn't guided me here,
I might never have found it.

33:43.480 --> 33:45.720
Well, let's just hope this
ancient weapon actually works.

34:05.240 --> 34:06.560
Where did you get those?

34:06.720 --> 34:08.837
They're military-grade
explosives.

34:10.280 --> 34:12.033
Perks of using Black Zero.

34:35.880 --> 34:38.395
Here goes.

34:58.440 --> 35:00.671
You're telling me there
will be collateral damage?

35:00.840 --> 35:03.355
I'm telling you
the room will be stuffed

35:03.480 --> 35:04.994
with collateral damage.

35:05.320 --> 35:08.040
This is no longer
a controlled situation.

35:08.200 --> 35:09.680
We have to abort.

35:10.160 --> 35:11.640
Proceed as planned.

35:11.800 --> 35:13.816
There comes a point in any coup
when it's more dangerous

35:13.840 --> 35:15.672
to back out
than to go forward.

35:16.120 --> 35:17.793
Too many people
are involved to depend on

35:17.960 --> 35:19.280
none of them
betraying the secret.

35:19.440 --> 35:21.875
- Even inadvertently...
- Let me be clear.

35:23.640 --> 35:26.917
Your opinion
means nothing to me.

35:28.320 --> 35:29.320
Primus?

35:32.520 --> 35:34.034
We can't withdraw now.

35:35.280 --> 35:37.476
We've already
paid too much, Dev.

35:47.680 --> 35:50.673
People of Kandor City.

35:51.360 --> 35:56.355
The time for holding
myself apart is over.

35:57.920 --> 35:59.115
I look forward

35:59.280 --> 36:03.399
to coming to know you
intimately.

36:03.880 --> 36:06.440
Soon, you will have

36:06.640 --> 36:09.872
no secrets from me.

36:10.040 --> 36:12.430
Bomb!
Clear the room!

36:37.200 --> 36:38.953
There has to be a way in.

36:39.320 --> 36:41.000
I know if we work together,
we can find it.

36:41.040 --> 36:43.236
I think you might be
more right than you realize.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.912
I can't believe
I didn't see it before.

36:46.240 --> 36:48.391
Doesn't that symbol
look familiar to you?

36:50.480 --> 36:54.633
It's the El and Zod sigil
superimposed on each other.

36:56.320 --> 36:58.516
I think our families
put this vault here.

36:59.360 --> 37:02.034
Raika, Raika said
that because I'm an El,

37:02.240 --> 37:04.197
I have the power
to destroy everything.

37:05.480 --> 37:07.278
And the power
to open the vault.

37:09.280 --> 37:11.192
Maybe this is
a lock of some kind.

37:15.680 --> 37:16.750
Blood of the house.

37:16.960 --> 37:19.600
Blood of the house.
Um, do you have a knife?

37:19.840 --> 37:20.840
Yeah.

37:27.760 --> 37:28.876
Okay.

37:44.080 --> 37:45.080
I don't know.

37:47.880 --> 37:50.918
An El and a Zod.

38:03.040 --> 38:05.396
I'm not used
to being in this position.

38:08.560 --> 38:09.560
No!

38:10.960 --> 38:11.960
Don't do it.

38:12.960 --> 38:16.078
That thing in there will kill
us, and everyone in Kandor.

38:16.280 --> 38:18.033
Everyone in the universe,
if it can, okay?

38:48.160 --> 38:51.392
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:51.760 --> 38:53.717
- Whoa.
- He betrayed us.

38:56.040 --> 38:58.509
Hey, just surrender.

38:58.680 --> 39:00.717
Okay, they promised
not to hurt you.

39:01.440 --> 39:04.558
That thing in there, they
told me it's called Doomsday.

39:04.760 --> 39:06.558
Okay, I know that name.

39:06.720 --> 39:09.315
It's a soulless killing machine
that can't be destroyed.

39:09.480 --> 39:10.675
Or controlled.

39:11.440 --> 39:13.591
Seg, if you
let that thing loose,

39:13.760 --> 39:16.275
it will kill everything
that it comes across.

39:16.800 --> 39:17.870
It's true.

39:19.400 --> 39:20.896
That's why we have
given over our lives

39:20.920 --> 39:23.196
to protecting the universe
from Doomsday.

39:23.360 --> 39:26.080
My people were here
when the weapon arrived.

39:26.280 --> 39:29.637
The Els and the Zods,
they thought that together,

39:29.840 --> 39:31.479
they were creating
something great.

39:32.560 --> 39:33.789
But we've seen it.

39:34.480 --> 39:38.394
We understand the unending
cloud of hatred they birthed.

39:45.160 --> 39:47.311
You do not know
the danger we are in.

39:47.840 --> 39:50.753
It doesn't matter what
may have happened in the past.

39:53.360 --> 39:55.591
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa.

39:55.760 --> 39:57.114
Our world.

39:59.040 --> 40:00.040
No!

40:07.360 --> 40:08.360
Shit!

40:15.240 --> 40:16.240
Hey.

40:16.720 --> 40:18.439
Cover me, I see a way out.

40:20.320 --> 40:21.320
Seg!

40:27.120 --> 40:28.474
Go, go, go.

40:39.520 --> 40:40.795
Go!

41:18.000 --> 41:19.514
Just have the skimmer ready.

41:20.120 --> 41:21.759
This is going to be
a hot extraction.

41:21.920 --> 41:23.593
They'll be there,
you can trust me.

41:23.760 --> 41:25.200
- I believe you.
- You understand why

41:25.240 --> 41:26.469
I had to do that, right?

41:27.000 --> 41:28.673
The timeline is
too important to risk.

41:28.880 --> 41:30.200
We're still friends, Seg.

41:30.360 --> 41:32.033
You can come with us
back to Kandor.

41:32.280 --> 41:33.960
Find your Zeta-Beam gadget
and ride it back

41:34.120 --> 41:36.191
to wherever you came from
and never come back.

41:42.200 --> 41:44.635
- Does this mean you're in?
- I'm with you.

41:44.840 --> 41:47.639
But no Doomsday.
We find another way.

41:54.480 --> 41:57.359
I have His Eminence.
We are headed to his chambers.

41:58.360 --> 42:01.876
- You do your job well.
- Thank you.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.799
If this moment
is to be my last,

42:17.960 --> 42:19.838
I trust you'll allow me

42:20.000 --> 42:22.560
to look upon it
with my own eyes.

42:33.440 --> 42:38.231
Most worthy Sagitari.
