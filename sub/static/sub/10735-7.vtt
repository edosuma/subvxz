<b>1x17 - Bros in Space</b>

00:04.983 --> 00:07.551
There it is...
Revonnah.

00:07.587 --> 00:09.387
Bet you're glad to get
home, huh, Rook?

00:09.422 --> 00:12.189
I am.
I have not participated in the

00:12.225 --> 00:15.347
harvest in some time, and it
will be good for you to dig in

00:15.383 --> 00:17.795
and get your hands dirty.
- Whatever.

00:17.830 --> 00:20.538
Being a hero is all about
working with my hands.

00:20.573 --> 00:22.802
Humungousaur ... boom.

00:22.838 --> 00:25.342
Shocksquatch ... boom.

00:25.378 --> 00:27.017
Not quite what I meant.

00:27.053 --> 00:29.051
Right. Fieldwork.
Can't wait.

00:29.086 --> 00:31.622
<i>You will love
Revonnah at harvest time.</i>

00:31.657 --> 00:33.792
<i>We have majestic, rugged terrain.</i>

you will see them.</i>

00:36.365 --> 00:39.934
<i>Revonnahganders are gentle,
peace-loving farmers.</i>

00:39.969 --> 00:42.403
<i>They will welcome you with open arms.</i>

Behold ... the fruit of
Revonnah ... Amber Ogia.

01:58.387 --> 02:01.054
Ahhhh.
- Ew!

02:01.089 --> 02:03.856
There's other stuff to eat
besides Amber... whatever, right?

02:03.891 --> 02:07.726
We have many different
recipes for it.

02:07.761 --> 02:09.294
Great.

02:12.198 --> 02:14.900
Hey.
We're pretty high up here.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.707
<i>- Rook...
- Blanko!</i>

02:21.742 --> 02:24.710
<i>- Welcome!
- Welcome home!</i>

02:24.745 --> 02:28.714
Our space-Traveling brother.
All the neighbors saw you land!

02:28.749 --> 02:30.315
Meet my sisters ...

02:30.351 --> 02:34.820
Rook Shi, Rook Shim, and the
eldest, Rook Shar.

02:34.856 --> 02:37.556
Big family.

02:38.425 --> 02:40.625
Young one!

02:40.661 --> 02:43.795
You have grown!
I would like you all to meet ...

02:43.830 --> 02:45.763
Ben 10!

02:45.799 --> 02:48.834
I cannot believe Ben 10
is right here on Revonnah!

02:48.869 --> 02:53.071
The outworld tesser-bursts are full
of all of your wondrous exploits!

02:53.106 --> 02:57.008
Don't understand that,
but it sounds great!

02:57.043 --> 03:01.413
I see you've allowed yourself to
come home for harvest, Rook Blanko.

03:01.448 --> 03:04.215
My parents ...
Rook Da and Rook Bralla.

03:04.251 --> 03:08.286
Thank you for allowing
me to stay with you.

03:08.321 --> 03:09.921
What is he doing?

03:09.956 --> 03:13.824
I believe it is called
a bow ... an Earth custom.

03:13.860 --> 03:17.894
Mm. I thought
earthlings shook hands.

03:17.930 --> 03:20.230
I don't think your dad likes me.

03:20.265 --> 03:24.067
Relax.
This is not about you.

03:26.838 --> 03:30.841
So, all of this food is
made from that stuff?

03:34.913 --> 03:39.249
Yes. The entire meal
is made of Amber Ogia.

03:39.285 --> 03:43.087
Even the table was made from the resin.

03:52.099 --> 03:55.334
What does it feel like to
transform?

03:55.369 --> 03:57.669
Sort of like a...
good stretch.

04:02.076 --> 04:04.977
If any of you have a favorite
alien, just let me know.

04:05.012 --> 04:07.747
You are eating
with a back scratcher.

04:13.220 --> 04:18.156
Oh. Forgive me, Rook Bralla,
but I saw Rook Blanko return,

04:18.192 --> 04:21.827
and I wanted to be the first t...
Oh. Hello.

04:21.863 --> 04:24.164
Rayona. You look well.

04:24.199 --> 04:27.601
Might you accompany me
to the harvest festival?

04:27.636 --> 04:31.504
I... do not know the
plans of my houseguest,

04:31.540 --> 04:34.191
but I will see you there.

04:34.192 --> 04:36.843
It looks to be a fair harvest.

04:36.878 --> 04:41.080
The harvest would be fairer if
our eldest son were around more.

04:41.116 --> 04:44.350
The muroids have been unusually
aggressive, taking more than the

04:44.386 --> 04:46.519
amount we set aside by custom.

04:46.555 --> 04:48.488
Muroids?
- The rodents.

04:48.523 --> 04:51.057
We use their droppings
to fertilize the crop.

04:51.626 --> 04:55.261
Father ...

04:55.296 --> 04:58.549
<i>Rook Blanko? Remember me?
Would you go to the ...</i>

04:58.550 --> 05:02.135
Pardon me.
We're eating dinner.

05:02.170 --> 05:06.305
Not even possible.
- Every girl in the region used

05:06.340 --> 05:09.675
to be after our brother, but
he only had eyes for Rayona.

05:09.710 --> 05:13.511
Come on. Rook?!
- You sound surprised.

05:13.547 --> 05:17.047
This guy?
Mr. Uptight McStifferson?

05:17.083 --> 05:20.250
Enough!
We exist to coax Amber Ogia from

05:20.286 --> 05:24.322
the stone and to keep the
muroids away, not to bring foolish

05:24.323 --> 05:28.358
girls to the window or
off-worlders to the supper table ...

05:28.394 --> 05:31.862
even small, weak ones like him.

05:31.898 --> 05:34.398
Dude, I'm sitting right here.

05:36.102 --> 05:37.101
I will get it.

05:40.005 --> 05:41.472
Muroids!

06:05.566 --> 06:08.667
Blanko, have you ever
seen anything like it?

06:08.702 --> 06:10.435
What?

06:10.471 --> 06:14.272
That muroid at the
window. It stood on two legs.

06:19.913 --> 06:22.114
Ben!
Do a transformation!

06:22.150 --> 06:25.318
Do them all! Please?
- Actually, I'm kind of tired...

06:25.319 --> 06:27.687
just flew across the universe.

06:27.722 --> 06:30.257
Yes. Oh, yes.

06:30.292 --> 06:32.759
I am tired, as well... Ben.

06:32.794 --> 06:34.995
Oh!
Your show is on tonight!

06:35.030 --> 06:37.565
I have a show?

06:37.600 --> 06:39.934
It is only an
outworld tesser-burst set.

06:39.969 --> 06:42.470
Rook Da says the extranet
will rot your brain.

06:43.473 --> 06:46.974
<i>Spormax to solenoid, your
alien organic technomites will</i>

06:47.010 --> 06:50.478
<i>threaten Earthville no more!
Come, Gwevin, my space chimp!</i>

06:51.748 --> 06:55.016
<i>We celebrate victory with a
blended-beverage offering.</i>

06:55.052 --> 06:58.987
Unthinkable!
Did that really happen?

06:59.022 --> 07:00.822
Not... exactly.

07:02.426 --> 07:04.292
<i>Go to sleep, young one.</i>

07:04.328 --> 07:06.728
<i>...claws will make me run now!</i>

07:06.763 --> 07:08.830
Is there another episode?

07:17.540 --> 07:22.345
Not only is Amber Ogia
our food, it also serves as fuel

07:22.380 --> 07:23.980
for our lamps, flares, vehicles...

07:25.183 --> 07:26.782
<i>We grind it into grain...</i>

07:26.817 --> 07:28.984
Can you transform into
something now?

07:29.019 --> 07:30.686
Slapstrike?
Unitaur?

07:30.721 --> 07:36.024
The ones in that show?
I, uh, left those in my other Omnitrix.

07:46.302 --> 07:49.970
This'll be a lot easier
without all that rock in the way.

07:53.142 --> 07:57.344
Ta-da!
- Yay! Yay!

08:01.950 --> 08:05.885
<i>Your Earth friend is breaking stone
that stood for a hundred lifetimes!</i>

08:05.920 --> 08:09.556
And the spilled Amber Ogia
will only attract more muroids!

08:11.726 --> 08:14.761
My bad.
- Yes.

08:21.235 --> 08:24.604
That was your girlfriend?
Yeah, right.

08:24.639 --> 08:27.607
More believable than
your Alien X stories.

08:27.642 --> 08:29.642
Hey, you've seen Alien X.

08:29.677 --> 08:32.178
Yes.
And now you have seen Rayona.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.214
It's like I don't even know you.

08:38.019 --> 08:43.056
Oh, no! Hurry!
Here they come!

08:49.064 --> 08:50.497
Ben!

08:50.532 --> 08:52.633
Gro-o-o-o-ss!

09:00.881 --> 09:01.613
Muroids!

09:15.461 --> 09:17.895
On two legs?
Attacking in daylight?

09:17.930 --> 09:18.962
Unthinkable!

09:21.900 --> 09:23.701
Be gone, rodents!

09:23.736 --> 09:26.270
Come on, Ben!
- Easy for you to say!

09:26.306 --> 09:29.975
You're not covered in rat slobber!

09:36.182 --> 09:38.850
Now we're talking!

09:46.792 --> 09:50.161
And that's how to get your hands dirty.

09:50.196 --> 09:53.096
Locust!
- Locust!

09:54.433 --> 09:56.867
That is not ...

09:58.704 --> 09:59.669
Take him down!

10:00.705 --> 10:01.538
Stop!

10:01.573 --> 10:05.042
Hey! Stop!
Hey! Good guy!

10:05.077 --> 10:07.377
Just saved your crop!

10:12.284 --> 10:15.385
These are farmers, and we
have enough pests around.

10:15.421 --> 10:18.322
I was just trying to help.

10:19.892 --> 10:21.859
I will watch him closely.

10:21.894 --> 10:25.830
Ben, I think it would be best
not to transform for a while.

10:25.865 --> 10:30.234
Yeah. Wouldn't want to
accidentally turn into eatle.

10:36.542 --> 10:39.211
A good first day's work.

10:39.246 --> 10:41.080
Look at the size of
those things.

10:41.115 --> 10:44.968
They are not that big when
you consider that they hold a year's

10:44.969 --> 10:48.822
supply of food, fuel, and material
goods for the surrounding farms.

10:53.961 --> 10:56.796
They are back!

11:08.077 --> 11:08.976
<i>Bro!</i>

11:09.011 --> 11:12.379
First they stand
on two legs, now this?

11:20.489 --> 11:23.057
I'm not sure
this is a good idea.

11:50.085 --> 11:52.053
<i>Bro! Bro! Bro! Bro!</i>

11:54.256 --> 11:58.993
Most unusual.
Muroids eat food where it lies.

11:59.028 --> 12:02.396
Yes. Much is
strange about these rodents.

12:06.536 --> 12:08.603
Yeah, you'd better run!

12:11.374 --> 12:13.525
Thank you for helping
protect the silo ...

12:13.526 --> 12:15.677
for doing it without
changing your shape.

12:15.712 --> 12:17.479
Anytime.

12:28.992 --> 12:33.929
It's harvest time. Plenty more
where that came from, right?

12:33.964 --> 12:37.966
The muroids, the harvest, the
entire Revonnahgander way has

12:38.002 --> 12:41.003
been corrupted.
My own son is destroying the

12:41.038 --> 12:45.474
balance that has existed
since history began.

12:45.509 --> 12:49.178
Perhaps Ben and I should
track the muroids to their nest.

12:49.213 --> 12:53.216
Go, then! And do not
bother coming back until you're

12:53.217 --> 12:57.519
ready to join this family
and send that outworlder home!

12:58.755 --> 13:01.789
Relax.
This is not about you.

13:05.761 --> 13:08.730
For what it's worth, I was
starting to like harvesting.

13:08.765 --> 13:11.266
Perhaps I should not
have come back.

13:11.301 --> 13:13.568
Revonnah's traditions seem to be ending.

13:13.603 --> 13:14.536
Come on.

13:14.571 --> 13:18.105
Earth has had a lot bigger
problems than giant rats in helmets.

13:18.141 --> 13:21.742
You do not have Amber Ogia.
It is the perfect material.

13:21.778 --> 13:25.012
It do taste better than it looks.

13:25.047 --> 13:29.716
Amber Ogia can feed a
space fleet, clothe it, fuel it.

13:29.751 --> 13:32.069
Any two-bit lowlife
or petty dictator might

13:32.070 --> 13:34.387
steal our Ogia and threaten the galaxy.

13:34.423 --> 13:36.523
Let's not get carried away.

13:36.559 --> 13:39.760
<i>Bro! Bro!
Bro! Bro! Bro!</i>

13:50.038 --> 13:52.440
Fistrick!

13:52.475 --> 13:55.309
Okay, so you were right about
the two-bit-lowlife thing.

13:55.345 --> 13:59.113
<i>I am your emancipaver...
the great...</i>

13:59.148 --> 14:02.282
ah, you dumb rats
only know the one word.

14:07.356 --> 14:09.423
Bros!
Bonding time!

14:22.604 --> 14:24.071
Wussup, bro?

14:27.710 --> 14:31.675
Now take your sick new
gear, get in your harvesters,

14:31.676 --> 14:35.641
and bring me every one of
those Amber Oglio berries

14:35.642 --> 14:38.284
<i>and show those hicks how it's done!</i>

14:42.223 --> 14:44.290
Right?!

14:49.931 --> 14:54.167
With enough Amber Ogia,
even Fistrick could wage a galactic war.

14:54.202 --> 14:56.736
Or sell it to someone who will.

15:20.111 --> 15:23.079
Machine harvesters will
tear the Amber Ogia away

15:23.115 --> 15:25.949
and ruin those fields forever.
- You go warn the farmers.

15:25.985 --> 15:27.885
I'll take care of Fistrick.

15:27.920 --> 15:28.786
Agreed.

15:33.159 --> 15:35.460
Hey, reject!

15:35.495 --> 15:37.295
What the...?
Ben 10?

15:37.330 --> 15:39.464
That you, bro?

15:44.537 --> 15:47.038
These boots got
super-good insulation.

15:50.943 --> 15:54.245
How did
you get to Revonnah?

15:54.281 --> 15:56.648
I know a guy.

15:56.683 --> 15:59.417
How do you know
about Amber Ogia?

15:59.453 --> 16:01.787
I know a guy who knows a guy!

16:05.758 --> 16:08.760
And the harvesters?
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

16:08.795 --> 16:11.329
Let me guess, eh?
You know a guy?

16:11.365 --> 16:14.065
Knew a guy.

16:15.868 --> 16:18.336
Past tense.

16:18.372 --> 16:20.739
Father! Mother!
Muroids!

16:20.774 --> 16:22.474
Muroids!

16:22.509 --> 16:24.942
Rook Blanko!
You were out all night.

16:24.978 --> 16:28.346
No matter.
The muroids are coming in force!

16:44.197 --> 16:46.797
This is the end of the
Revonnahgander way.

16:46.833 --> 16:48.866
What have you done?

16:56.774 --> 17:00.410
Ben and I did not bring
this threat to Revonnah.

17:07.251 --> 17:11.286
Everyone, use your
launchers! Use your scythes!

17:11.321 --> 17:13.772
Use your fists if you know how!

17:13.773 --> 17:16.224
Aim for the muroid, not the machine!

17:38.682 --> 17:42.953
<i>Techadon starbeam platform.
Totally thrashes planets good.</i>

17:42.988 --> 17:48.225
<i>And before you ask, I got it from a
different guy, and he's past tense, too.</i>

17:48.261 --> 17:50.394
You brought me
here to gloat?

17:50.430 --> 17:52.764
What are you, dense?

17:52.799 --> 17:56.668
Turns out that Aglio Olio stuff
is the perfect fuel for this thing.

17:56.703 --> 18:00.137
Soon as I'm loaded up, hundreds
of worlds are gonna have to do

18:00.172 --> 18:05.476
things the Fistrick way, and Ben
10's not gonna be around to help 'em.

18:07.947 --> 18:10.881
I'm gonna smack that
stupid grin right off you!

18:13.919 --> 18:15.618
Any minute now, eh?

18:18.322 --> 18:22.458
Where is this "Fist-trick" from?
- Um, Earth.

18:22.494 --> 18:24.393
Where you come from?

18:28.233 --> 18:32.503
I am from Revonnah!
- Then fight like a Revonnahgander!

18:42.983 --> 18:46.984
With your permission, father,
I will fight as I please.

18:54.159 --> 18:55.826
Blanko, where are they going?

18:55.862 --> 19:00.731
Wherever it is, Ben had
better be there kicking the butt.

19:02.569 --> 19:05.937
I am serious.
I am so kicking your butt.

19:05.973 --> 19:07.940
You don't got time, bro.

19:18.252 --> 19:20.786
It took me months to
train them for that.

19:20.822 --> 19:24.690
Power up the starbeam.
I want to pop a few planets.

19:26.627 --> 19:30.996
Ooh! Inhabited ...
just the way I like 'em.

19:41.341 --> 19:43.842
Come on.
Come on!

19:43.877 --> 19:45.577
There it is.

19:46.846 --> 19:49.514
Bro!

19:57.323 --> 20:01.760
You missed.
- You are gonna pay for that.

20:01.795 --> 20:04.195
Luckily, I know a guy...

20:04.231 --> 20:08.433
...who's gonna
kick your teeth in. Present tense.

20:13.138 --> 20:15.139
<i> Bro!</i>

20:29.588 --> 20:33.356
No!
Come back, you cowards!

20:35.927 --> 20:40.430
Oh! You're gonna pay
for that, too, chump!

20:46.605 --> 20:47.371
Wha...?

20:49.809 --> 20:52.142
You...
are...

20:52.177 --> 20:55.412
so...
obnoxious!

20:55.448 --> 20:57.381
<i> Bro.</i>

20:57.417 --> 21:00.985
Me and blasters
are usually a bad mix.

21:05.090 --> 21:08.927
But Ogia and blasters are even worse.

21:17.370 --> 21:19.476
The land has been kind.

21:19.540 --> 21:23.476
Despite our losses, the
harvest is plentiful.

21:23.511 --> 21:28.581
Blanko, without
tradition, you are nothing.

21:28.617 --> 21:32.552
But without you, tradition
itself could not have survived.

21:32.587 --> 21:35.154
Then tradition and I are even.

21:35.190 --> 21:37.356
Come back next harvest, son.

21:37.392 --> 21:42.561
But, please, keep your friend
very, very far from here.

21:42.596 --> 21:45.631
Of course.
- Hey, look, Rook.

21:45.666 --> 21:47.999
I'm the harvest king!

21:49.903 --> 21:53.404
More like the harvest queen.

21:56.676 --> 21:58.109
You!

22:03.395 --> 22:06.209
