00:03.859 --> 00:05.593
Okay. Now, Emma, say "daddy."

00:06.049 --> 00:07.116
Come on. You can say it.

00:07.151 --> 00:09.852
It's just "da" with a "D" on the end of it.

00:09.887 --> 00:11.087
"Dada" is also acceptable.

00:12.656 --> 00:13.823
Just keep repeating it.

00:13.857 --> 00:15.591
Kids say what they hear all day.

00:15.626 --> 00:18.361
Thats why I'm pretty sure my first words were
"I'm sorry, officer."

00:20.664 --> 00:22.632
Okay, people, she is on the move.

00:22.666 --> 00:25.234
Sondra just texted and
she's on her way down.

00:25.269 --> 00:26.469
Bro, I don't think I can break up with her,
man.

00:26.503 --> 00:28.337
She's not gonna take it well.

00:28.372 --> 00:29.372
Oh, I know.

00:29.406 --> 00:31.974
Tell her I moved, or... or died,

00:32.009 --> 00:33.976
or died on the move.

00:34.011 --> 00:35.711
Dude, calm down.

00:35.746 --> 00:36.846
Just do it like we rehearsed,

00:36.880 --> 00:39.715
where, may I say,
Danny played a spot-on Sondra.

00:39.750 --> 00:41.684
(Mimics Sondra) Oh my God,
Tucker, you're adorable!

00:41.718 --> 00:43.419
I'm adorable! We're adorable!

00:43.453 --> 00:44.420
A-dor-able!

00:47.457 --> 00:49.392
Hey, we're here for you, man.

00:49.426 --> 00:50.359
(Knocking)

00:50.394 --> 00:52.128
Go! Go! Oh, God!

00:54.064 --> 00:55.398
(Sighs)

00:55.432 --> 00:58.267
Oh my God,
I was just gonna text you when you texted me.

00:58.302 --> 01:00.002
It's like we're on the same wavelength,

01:00.037 --> 01:01.804
which is weird, 'cause we are not, at all.

01:01.838 --> 01:02.838
(Laughing nervously)

01:02.873 --> 01:03.839
Yeah, about that...

01:03.874 --> 01:04.941
Tucker, we need to talk.

01:04.974 --> 01:05.908
Hey, that's my line.

01:05.943 --> 01:06.976
It's not you, it's me.

01:07.010 --> 01:08.511
Hey, that's also my line.

01:08.545 --> 01:09.745
Tucker, can you pay attention?

01:09.780 --> 01:11.714
I am breaking up with you!

01:11.748 --> 01:14.183
Oh my God, that wasn't as hard
as I thought it was gonna be.

01:15.319 --> 01:16.586
So, see you around the building.

01:22.226 --> 01:24.026
What just happened?

01:24.061 --> 01:26.028
Wow, we did not rehearse that version.

01:27.831 --> 01:29.398
Dude, you are so lucky.

01:29.433 --> 01:32.602
You get all the benefits of breaking up,
but all the sympathy of being dumped.

01:32.636 --> 01:33.703
God, I envy you!

01:35.472 --> 01:36.706
What is wrong with me?

01:36.740 --> 01:39.609
I can't even keep somebody
that I don't want.

01:39.643 --> 01:41.577
I'm pathetic. (Mimics Sondra) Pathetic!

01:43.547 --> 01:45.548
Actually, tuck, it's more like...
(High-pitched) Pathetic!

02:05.769 --> 02:07.536
Man, I don't think this is working.

02:07.571 --> 02:10.406
My lap is wet, my boys are numb,
and I'm still depressed.

02:12.442 --> 02:13.542
Ice cream sucks.

02:14.645 --> 02:17.346
Yeah, I agree,
but Mr. Romantic comedy over here

02:17.381 --> 02:18.781
thinks we have to eat our feelings.

02:18.815 --> 02:20.816
And how'd I get stuck with Sherbert?

02:20.851 --> 02:22.652
Sherbert never fixed anything.

02:24.655 --> 02:26.789
"I'm just a girl standing in front of a boy

02:26.823 --> 02:28.724
asking him to love me."

02:30.661 --> 02:31.761
Gets me every time.

02:33.830 --> 02:36.432
I just wish I knew why
every relationship I'm in

02:36.466 --> 02:38.601
ends in complete and total failure.

02:38.635 --> 02:40.703
Maybe you're looking in all the wrong places

02:40.737 --> 02:42.471
only to realize that the perfect girl

02:42.506 --> 02:44.540
was right there, all along.

02:44.574 --> 02:46.809
Maybe she was the best friend
at your best friend's wedding?

02:47.844 --> 02:51.647
Wow, you totally got dad's genes.

02:51.682 --> 02:53.516
Actually, these are mom's.

02:56.520 --> 02:57.687
Don't worry, Tucker.

02:57.721 --> 02:59.689
Okay, you just haven't met "the one" yet.

02:59.723 --> 03:01.590
Well, you've met the crazy one,

03:01.625 --> 03:02.625
the weird one,

03:02.659 --> 03:04.593
the one-you-weren't-even-
sure-was-a-girl one.

03:06.496 --> 03:08.497
You just haven't met the one one.

03:10.400 --> 03:11.634
Yeah, I have.

03:11.668 --> 03:13.569
Olivia Jones.

03:13.603 --> 03:16.672
We went out in college,
and she loved and left me.

03:16.707 --> 03:19.342
It's kind of becoming my life story.

03:19.376 --> 03:20.443
You should make that into a movie.

03:20.477 --> 03:21.677
They already have.

03:21.712 --> 03:24.547
It's super romantic until the end...

03:24.581 --> 03:25.548
(Whispers) When she dies.

03:29.586 --> 03:32.722
"101 ways to please your man."

03:32.756 --> 03:34.824
If you need more than one,
you're doing it wrong.

03:37.561 --> 03:39.595
Oh my God, I'm so glad you're home!

03:39.629 --> 03:40.830
Well, that makes one of us.

03:42.432 --> 03:44.533
I really,
really need to talk to another woman,

03:44.568 --> 03:45.768
and none of my girlfriends are around,

03:45.802 --> 03:48.604
my mother's in Europe,
and my mom-aunt is on tour,

03:48.638 --> 03:50.573
and my sister, well, ugh, I hate her,

03:50.607 --> 03:52.775
so... here I am.

03:52.809 --> 03:55.678
Well, obviously, I'm flattered.

03:57.481 --> 04:00.449
This guy at work who was hired after I was

04:00.484 --> 04:01.517
just got promoted.

04:01.551 --> 04:04.153
This is just a theory,

04:04.187 --> 04:06.255
but is he a better lawyer than you are?

04:07.391 --> 04:08.324
No.

04:08.358 --> 04:10.059
And it's totally unfair.

04:10.093 --> 04:14.697
Because Jeremy is always taking his frat
buddies to clubs and expensive lunches

04:14.731 --> 04:16.165
with his corporate card

04:16.199 --> 04:19.635
while I slave away at the office,
and use my card for actual business!

04:19.668 --> 04:20.803
Just like, like yesterday,

04:20.837 --> 04:23.606
when I took my client, Jill, for a latte.

04:23.640 --> 04:26.475
But, do I get promoted? Oh no!

04:26.510 --> 04:28.544
Meaning no matter what I have up here,

04:28.578 --> 04:31.414
I will never have what he has down there.

04:35.252 --> 04:37.286
Great speech. Yes, and really good stuff.

04:39.222 --> 04:40.523
Listen, cupcake,

04:40.557 --> 04:44.059
why do you think they gave you a
corporate card in the first place?

04:44.094 --> 04:46.862
To get out there and drum up business!

04:46.897 --> 04:50.766
Okay, when one of those frat buddies
accidentally kills a hooker in Vegas,

04:50.801 --> 04:51.834
who do you think he's gonna call?

04:55.272 --> 04:56.338
- Housekeeping?
- No!

04:59.276 --> 05:02.478
No, his lawyer, Jeremy.

05:02.512 --> 05:06.215
If you want to get ahead,
you need to start playing by their rules.

05:07.317 --> 05:08.317
- I need to kill a hooker
- (Groans)

05:10.954 --> 05:11.954
No!

05:11.988 --> 05:14.824
No, you need to reel in the big fish!

05:14.858 --> 05:16.125
Okay, trust me.

05:16.159 --> 05:18.794
You gotta schmooze 'em and booze 'em,
or you're gonna lose 'em.

05:20.564 --> 05:22.565
I don't even know where to start!

05:22.599 --> 05:24.500
Where do I go? What do I do?

05:24.534 --> 05:25.801
Okay, first off,
just pull yourself together!

05:25.836 --> 05:27.636
Ow!

05:29.506 --> 05:31.240
But, more importantly,

05:31.274 --> 05:34.443
why don't you take me to lunch,
and we can just bounce around some ideas?

05:34.478 --> 05:37.079
I'm thinking <i>Chez Lumiere.</i>

05:37.113 --> 05:39.982
Ooh, that place is really expensive.

05:40.016 --> 05:42.318
Well, then it's a good thing
you're not paying for it.

05:42.352 --> 05:43.953
God, you're slow.

05:48.758 --> 05:50.092
Hey, Ben, guess who that is.

05:51.094 --> 05:53.729
- No idea.
- It's Tucker's ex-girlfriend Olivia.

05:53.763 --> 05:54.830
I found her online!

05:54.865 --> 05:55.798
Why'd you do that?

05:55.832 --> 05:57.433
We're getting them back together.

05:57.467 --> 05:58.501
Why would we do that?

05:58.535 --> 06:00.336
Because she's the one that got away,

06:00.370 --> 06:01.937
the love of his life!

06:01.972 --> 06:04.306
It's nearly impossible to get over someone
if you've loved them your whole life.

06:04.341 --> 06:05.441
Oh, you mean like me and Riley?

06:06.543 --> 06:08.143
Yeah, that could be what I mean.

06:08.178 --> 06:10.012
Do I get credit for helping?

06:10.046 --> 06:12.348
- Totally.
- God, Tucker's lucky to have us.

06:13.917 --> 06:15.184
Olivia, hi, I'm Ben Wheeler...

06:15.218 --> 06:16.252
- Hi.
- ...Tucker's best friend.

06:16.286 --> 06:18.220
It was my idea to bring you here today.

06:18.255 --> 06:21.724
Oh, this is so weird.
Are you sure he even wants to see me again?

06:21.758 --> 06:23.959
Well, you're hot, so I'll go with yes.

06:23.994 --> 06:28.497
And he's desperate,
so I'll also go with yes.

06:28.532 --> 06:30.499
I don't know. Tucker was sweet.

06:30.534 --> 06:32.635
He just never really had
a sense of direction,

06:32.669 --> 06:33.702
wasn't much of a go-getter.

06:33.737 --> 06:36.605
Well,
he's totally going and getting stuff now.

06:36.640 --> 06:39.408
He's a super successful
producer on a big TV show.

06:39.442 --> 06:41.243
To be honest, we both look up to him.

06:42.612 --> 06:44.380
That's figurative. He probably
hasn't grown since you've seen him.

06:48.251 --> 06:51.020
Mrs. Lobster, I'm sorry.

06:51.054 --> 06:53.889
Your husband won't be
making it home tonight.

06:53.924 --> 06:55.558
He had a late dinner.

06:55.592 --> 06:57.726
(Laughing)

06:57.761 --> 07:00.663
Here's to corporate cards.

07:00.697 --> 07:03.666
- That was butter.
- I know that now.

07:03.700 --> 07:07.303
Doesn't it feel good to be
splurging like the big boys?

07:07.337 --> 07:10.306
Well,
it's definitely easier than killing a hooker.

07:10.340 --> 07:11.540
I do feel a little guilty.

07:11.575 --> 07:14.376
Hey, I could be your client someday.

07:14.411 --> 07:18.047
Things don't pick up in the real estate
business, I could sue this place.

07:18.081 --> 07:21.050
All it takes is one hot coffee
spilled on your lap, and...

07:21.084 --> 07:22.217
Oh, damn it!

07:22.252 --> 07:23.852
I really did spill coffee!

07:25.055 --> 07:27.089
Oh, thank you.

07:27.123 --> 07:29.658
Oh my God, it's actually not that bad.

07:29.693 --> 07:30.993
Oh, that's just the tax.

07:32.562 --> 07:33.629
Perrin?

07:33.663 --> 07:35.464
Mr. Reynolds, hi! Oh my gosh, hi!

07:35.498 --> 07:38.634
I'm just finishing up,
and I will be back at the office in no time.

07:38.668 --> 07:40.402
I don't even know why I'm here.

07:40.437 --> 07:43.439
Well, don't look at me for answers,
I drank my lunch.

07:43.473 --> 07:45.541
I can see you're entertaining a client here,

07:45.575 --> 07:47.242
so take all the time you need.

07:47.277 --> 07:49.111
Although, fair warning,

07:49.145 --> 07:50.913
if it's Bob from the Thatcher case,

07:50.947 --> 07:52.114
he'll drink you under the table,

07:52.148 --> 07:54.049
and you'll end up in bed with his wife.

07:54.084 --> 07:56.852
- (Laughing)
- It's... it's not.

07:56.886 --> 07:58.954
Hey, Perrin, you play golf?

07:58.989 --> 08:01.056
Um, not really.

08:01.091 --> 08:03.792
I told the other partners
you weren't a lesbian!

08:03.827 --> 08:05.527
Hey, you keep up the good work!

08:06.930 --> 08:08.697
- Who was that?
- My boss.

08:08.732 --> 08:10.799
And he told me to keep up the good work.

08:10.834 --> 08:13.535
As in, I'm doing good work.
As in, this is working!

08:13.570 --> 08:16.338
Well, if work we must,

08:16.373 --> 08:20.342
may I suggest we continue
slaving away over pedicures?

08:20.377 --> 08:23.379
Well, it would be criminal not to.

08:25.348 --> 08:26.281
Cheers!

08:28.852 --> 08:31.086
Tucker, we got a surprise for you!

08:31.121 --> 08:33.856
Uh-huh. Yeah.

08:33.890 --> 08:37.558
Last time you two had a surprise for me,
we had to call animal control.

08:38.662 --> 08:40.496
Dude, this is even better than the ferret,

08:40.530 --> 08:42.530
and I highly doubt this
surprise will die in your wall.

08:43.633 --> 08:45.668
Tuck,
you don't need to be sad and lonely anymore!

08:45.702 --> 08:47.536
- We found Olivia!
- Olivia?

08:47.570 --> 08:49.138
Wait, my Olivia?

08:49.172 --> 08:53.042
She broke my heart, my spirit,
and my stereo system, all in one day!

08:54.310 --> 08:56.311
Okay,
maybe this isn't better than the ferret.

08:56.346 --> 08:58.180
You guys don't get it.

08:58.214 --> 09:01.150
She's not just my ex-girlfriend,
she's my ex-wife!

09:01.184 --> 09:02.651
Your ex what?

09:02.686 --> 09:06.622
Actually, that's not true.
We're still married.

09:06.656 --> 09:08.624
Hello, Tucker.

09:12.856 --> 09:14.790
What do you mean, we're still married?

09:14.824 --> 09:17.593
What do you mean, you were married?

09:17.627 --> 09:20.796
Am I the only one that feels like I
missed a crucial piece of the story?

09:20.830 --> 09:22.865
I fell in love my senior year of college.

09:22.899 --> 09:26.335
And I was about to get deported,
so Tucker offered to marry me.

09:26.369 --> 09:28.270
So she could get a green card,

09:28.304 --> 09:31.406
not run off with a bartender named
Alfredo the second she got it.

09:31.441 --> 09:34.343
Oh my God,
I love a twist. What happened next?

09:37.080 --> 09:39.314
I filed for divorce. End of story.

09:39.349 --> 09:41.083
Was it?

09:42.418 --> 09:46.155
Yeah, it turns out I actually forgot
to sign and mail those papers.

09:46.189 --> 09:49.658
God, I knew that little mistake
would pay off for me some day.

09:49.692 --> 09:51.827
Yeah, well,
those are getting mailed in today.

09:51.861 --> 09:53.729
Okay, fine. File for divorce.

09:53.763 --> 09:54.863
I'll take half of everything you have,

09:54.898 --> 09:56.865
which, according to these two dingoes,
is a lot.

09:56.900 --> 10:01.570
Now, which one of these rooms is ours?
I'd like to do a quick little inventory,

10:01.604 --> 10:04.339
because, you know, after all,
what's yours is mine,

10:04.374 --> 10:05.541
and what's mine was yours.

10:08.411 --> 10:09.511
What have you done?

10:11.247 --> 10:13.982
All right, look, I don't want to point any
fingers, but this was all Danny's idea.

10:16.219 --> 10:17.219
Thank you!

10:17.253 --> 10:19.021
Finally, I get some credit around here, man!

10:22.158 --> 10:25.761
Now this is why I became a lawyer.

10:27.664 --> 10:31.400
I always say,
if you're gonna kick out that glass ceiling,

10:31.434 --> 10:34.303
do it with bedazzled toes.

10:34.337 --> 10:35.604
(Cell phone rings)

10:35.638 --> 10:37.339
(Gasps) Oh, oh, it's my boss!

10:38.541 --> 10:41.476
Hello, Mr. Reynolds.

10:41.511 --> 10:44.213
Why am I not back in the office yet?

10:44.247 --> 10:45.447
Um...

10:45.481 --> 10:49.251
Chatty. Chatty potential client
that I am wooing right now.

10:49.285 --> 10:52.120
So much woo going on, yeah.

10:52.155 --> 10:55.023
Yeah, he's... he's big!

10:55.058 --> 10:56.992
He's a huge client.

10:57.026 --> 10:59.795
Yes, he's a swimmer...

10:59.829 --> 11:01.530
a mouthbreather...

11:01.564 --> 11:03.765
oh. Oh, he's a fish!

11:03.800 --> 11:05.734
He's a big, big fish, sir.

11:05.768 --> 11:08.303
I'm sorry, what was that?

11:08.338 --> 11:11.340
Can you hold on for one second,
Mr. Reynolds?

11:11.374 --> 11:13.408
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

11:13.443 --> 11:16.078
He wants to meet my potential
client and help me seal the deal.

11:16.112 --> 11:17.212
What am I gonna do?

11:17.247 --> 11:18.380
How should I know?

11:20.149 --> 11:21.917
This was all your idea!

11:21.951 --> 11:25.120
Why can't you just lie and
pretend that you have a client?

11:25.154 --> 11:27.823
Mrs. Wheeler, I can't just pretend...

11:27.857 --> 11:29.992
Oh my God, that's brilliant.

11:30.026 --> 11:32.928
Hello, Mr. Reynolds,
I am so sorry about that.

11:32.962 --> 11:36.498
My client was just...
Getting onto his helicopter.

11:36.532 --> 11:37.833
Yes, uh-huh.

11:37.867 --> 11:39.568
What was that?

11:39.602 --> 11:41.336
Right. Yes, sir.

11:41.371 --> 11:44.473
How about I set up that
meeting for tomorrow?

11:44.507 --> 11:47.409
Great, I will see you then.

11:47.443 --> 11:48.443
Okay, bye-bye, now.

11:48.478 --> 11:50.078
Yeah!

11:50.113 --> 11:51.213
Huh?

11:55.918 --> 11:57.085
Tucker, we're sorry,

11:57.120 --> 11:59.154
but how were we supposed to
know she was a nightmare,

11:59.188 --> 12:00.789
wrapped in a catastrophe,

12:00.823 --> 12:01.823
covered in sexy?

12:03.593 --> 12:05.527
You know what our mistake was?

12:05.561 --> 12:06.795
Telling her how awesome you were.

12:06.829 --> 12:08.730
You know how to fix this?
We tell her the truth.

12:08.765 --> 12:10.599
(Scoffs) That I'm awesome?

12:10.633 --> 12:12.267
(Scoffs) No.

12:12.302 --> 12:13.368
Follow my lead, okay?

12:13.403 --> 12:14.436
Hey, Olivia.

12:14.470 --> 12:15.437
Look, we lied to you.

12:15.471 --> 12:18.307
Tucker's actually a loser who has nothing.

12:18.341 --> 12:20.208
Yeah, you got that right.

12:20.243 --> 12:21.943
These watches are knockoffs.

12:21.978 --> 12:24.012
Yeah, look at him. He's pathetic.

12:24.047 --> 12:26.014
He sent his friends out to find him a girl.

12:26.049 --> 12:27.916
Guilty.

12:27.950 --> 12:30.052
Da.

12:30.086 --> 12:31.920
- What is that?
- Uh...

12:31.954 --> 12:34.923
That...
that is the reason Tucker has no money,

12:34.957 --> 12:37.859
because all of it goes to his daughter,
Emma.

12:37.894 --> 12:40.329
You want me to believe that's your baby?

12:40.363 --> 12:42.331
What are you saying?

12:42.365 --> 12:44.232
What? That I can't have a white baby?

12:44.267 --> 12:46.435
Now that's just racist.

12:48.204 --> 12:49.237
(Mouths)

12:49.272 --> 12:50.439
- Dada.
- Oh my God!

12:50.473 --> 12:52.174
Oh my God, you said "dada"!

12:52.208 --> 12:54.176
I can't believe you finally said it!

12:56.145 --> 12:59.948
Tucker! You must be so happy, man!

12:59.982 --> 13:01.216
I am!

13:01.250 --> 13:03.085
- So proud...
- Oh.

13:03.119 --> 13:04.820
Of my white baby.

13:06.089 --> 13:08.890
Hi, Tucker.
I feel really awful about what happened.

13:08.925 --> 13:10.826
Well, I feel surprisingly fine. Bye now.

13:10.860 --> 13:12.694
But I'm here to take you back.

13:12.729 --> 13:14.629
Give Ben back his baby, so I can hug you!

13:16.366 --> 13:17.699
- Who is she?
- I'm his wife.

13:17.734 --> 13:19.534
His what?

13:19.569 --> 13:22.571
You were cheating on your wife with me
while I was cheating on my husband with you?

13:22.605 --> 13:25.273
You are a horrible person! Horrible!

13:25.308 --> 13:26.975
He is all yours.

13:27.009 --> 13:29.911
Thanks, but I don't need
another broke loser in my life,

13:29.946 --> 13:31.980
so I guess I'll divorce him after all.

13:32.014 --> 13:33.749
Well, he owns this apartment.

13:33.783 --> 13:35.050
By law, you get half of that.

13:35.084 --> 13:36.818
It's how I got mine.

13:38.688 --> 13:41.456
Okay, new plan.

13:41.491 --> 13:42.691
I give you a divorce,

13:42.725 --> 13:43.792
and you give me this apartment.

13:46.662 --> 13:48.530
Oh, hey, is it cool if we stay?

13:48.564 --> 13:49.564
I got a kid.

13:49.599 --> 13:51.333
And I'm on the road a lot.

13:51.367 --> 13:52.501
You won't even know I'm here.

13:57.838 --> 14:00.573
Hi. I need you to be a fake
client for a real crisis.

14:00.608 --> 14:01.708
And I need you to be a real lawyer

14:01.742 --> 14:02.809
- for some fake documents.
- When?

14:02.843 --> 14:03.810
- Tomorrow.
- No good.

14:03.844 --> 14:04.811
- When do you need me?
- Tomorrow.

14:04.845 --> 14:06.746
- No good.
- You know what this means.

14:06.781 --> 14:08.348
We need the wheelers.

14:08.382 --> 14:10.250
Both: Damn it.

14:10.284 --> 14:12.352
- I'll take Ben.
- I guess I'll take Mrs. Wheeler.

14:12.386 --> 14:13.453
Rock-paper-scissors for Danny?

14:14.488 --> 14:16.156
- (Chuckles)
- Oh, fine, I'll take him.

14:21.696 --> 14:23.563
Okay, now remember,

14:23.598 --> 14:25.799
you are the rich, silent investor...

14:25.833 --> 14:27.668
emphasis on the silent.

14:27.702 --> 14:30.704
And you are the hipster,
techie genius who's an introvert.

14:30.738 --> 14:32.372
That means you don't talk either.

14:32.407 --> 14:34.307
Oh, here he is.

14:34.342 --> 14:36.243
Okay, please, please, don't embarrass me.

14:36.277 --> 14:38.278
Oh!

14:38.312 --> 14:40.414
Wow. Smooth move, Perrin.

14:40.448 --> 14:43.316
If someone slips on that,
make sure we represent them.

14:43.351 --> 14:45.986
Just what I was thinking, sir.

14:46.020 --> 14:48.689
So, these are... the guys.

14:48.723 --> 14:50.924
They are huge,
huge bigwigs in the tech world,

14:50.958 --> 14:52.626
but they're talking to a ton of other firms,

14:52.660 --> 14:54.528
so who knows if they're even
gonna want to sign with us.

14:54.562 --> 14:55.495
Hey, Perrin,

14:55.530 --> 14:56.797
unless I read your contract wrong,

14:56.831 --> 14:58.465
you don't get paid by the word,

14:58.499 --> 14:59.800
so shall we let these guys talk?

14:59.834 --> 15:01.435
Or me?

15:02.437 --> 15:04.438
Um, you guys have any questions?

15:04.472 --> 15:08.175
I did when we started,
but technologies change so quickly,

15:08.209 --> 15:09.409
they are now obsolete.

15:11.245 --> 15:13.213
Okay.

15:13.247 --> 15:16.049
Actually, Jason, I've got several questions.

15:16.084 --> 15:17.584
First of all,

15:17.618 --> 15:20.120
how many attorneys do you even have in
your intellectual properties department?

15:20.154 --> 15:21.822
And, confidentially,

15:21.856 --> 15:23.423
we're making an I.P.O.
In the next few months,

15:23.458 --> 15:26.827
so I need to be sure that your firm has
a background in securities, as well.

15:28.896 --> 15:30.330
That's a good question.

15:30.364 --> 15:33.300
Um, what would you say the
market value of your I.P.O. Is?

15:35.103 --> 15:36.203
You know what, Jason?

15:36.237 --> 15:37.337
I don't want to waste your time.

15:37.371 --> 15:39.172
We're going with Wasserman & Peterman.

15:39.207 --> 15:41.274
They just feel more... real.

15:41.309 --> 15:44.244
Oh, they're real. I totally understand.

15:44.278 --> 15:47.948
Because I prefer real clients, as well,

15:47.982 --> 15:49.816
considering you're a New York ranger.

15:49.851 --> 15:51.918
I have season tickets, okay?

15:51.953 --> 15:55.689
And you, you're the genius who
always gets my order wrong.

15:55.723 --> 15:57.624
Oh yeah, Mr. Scotch and Soda.

15:57.658 --> 16:00.494
- It's gin and tonic.
- Argh!

16:00.528 --> 16:01.695
Mr. Reynolds, I can explain.

16:01.729 --> 16:04.264
I think you should explain it to H.R.

16:04.298 --> 16:05.632
I think we're done here.

16:05.666 --> 16:07.501
Mr. Reynolds, I'm so sorry I lied.
I promise it's not what you think.

16:07.535 --> 16:08.735
Oh, really?

16:08.770 --> 16:11.471
I think you used the company
card to buy some lip gloss

16:11.506 --> 16:13.240
and maybe cocktails out with the girls,

16:13.274 --> 16:14.941
and you got caught.

16:14.976 --> 16:16.309
I knew you were a
lightweight when I met you.

16:16.344 --> 16:18.245
Whoa-oh-oh, well, you know what?

16:18.279 --> 16:21.047
I knew that you were a pompous jerk.

16:21.082 --> 16:23.917
Okay, so I took a friend to lunch...

16:23.951 --> 16:24.951
On a yacht.

16:24.986 --> 16:26.887
But, you know,
what is the difference between that

16:26.921 --> 16:28.789
and golf and Martinis with your buddies?

16:28.823 --> 16:29.956
Uh, nothing, I say.

16:29.991 --> 16:32.459
Except, perhaps, a penis!

16:32.493 --> 16:34.661
Yeah, that's right. I said it!

16:34.695 --> 16:36.530
Because all the guys at the firm do it,

16:36.564 --> 16:38.265
and all of them get applauded.

16:38.299 --> 16:40.333
No, no, no, they get promoted!

16:40.368 --> 16:41.601
Just like your darling Jeremy,

16:41.636 --> 16:44.304
who, by the way,
does the perfect impression of you

16:44.338 --> 16:46.139
looking for you car in the parking garage.

16:46.174 --> 16:48.208
"Has anyone seen my 'Porsch-uh'?"

16:48.242 --> 16:50.177
It's "Porsche," okay?

16:50.211 --> 16:51.945
But does Jeremy get fired?

16:51.979 --> 16:55.115
Oh no, because Jeremy is just perfect!

16:55.149 --> 16:58.185
Meaning he's a guy,
and you all just stick together.

16:58.219 --> 16:59.953
(Applause)

17:03.691 --> 17:04.925
And that's not for me.

17:06.694 --> 17:08.829
Um, actually,
Jeremy was fired this afternoon

17:08.863 --> 17:10.830
after we reviewed his expense report

17:10.865 --> 17:13.733
and the elevator video of him imitating me.

17:13.768 --> 17:18.438
Did I mention that I am a huge
"Porsch-uh" fan?

17:18.472 --> 17:21.208
I think we're far past the
ass-kissing phase here,

17:21.242 --> 17:22.541
but I like spunky Perrin.

17:22.577 --> 17:24.277
She should show up in the courtroom!

17:24.311 --> 17:26.378
She's the woman I want to believe I hired.

17:26.414 --> 17:28.080
Oh, you did, sir, you did.

17:28.115 --> 17:29.883
Well, the jury's still out,

17:29.917 --> 17:33.787
but make sure that woman shows
up to work on Monday morning.

17:33.821 --> 17:36.056
Oh, and Perrin, just so you know,

17:36.090 --> 17:37.757
I am now driving

17:37.792 --> 17:39.693
a "Jag-u-ar."

17:45.666 --> 17:46.600
What?

17:47.635 --> 17:49.603
- You said "penis."
- (Laughing)

17:56.477 --> 18:00.113
As Tucker's esteemed attorney,
esquire-at-law,

18:00.147 --> 18:03.950
counselor, pro Bono, <i> ipso facto,</i>

18:03.985 --> 18:06.853
we would like to settle this
thing as quickly as possible.

18:06.888 --> 18:09.089
You get the apartment.
He gets the divorce papers.

18:09.123 --> 18:10.790
Mint?

18:10.825 --> 18:12.926
Tucker,
I can't believe you're being so reasonable.

18:12.960 --> 18:15.729
You know,
I came to this country with nothing,

18:15.763 --> 18:16.997
and now I'll be a homeowner.

18:17.031 --> 18:18.798
It's the American dream.

18:18.833 --> 18:23.637
And now Tucker will be a
25-year-old divorcee who rents.

18:23.671 --> 18:25.372
It's the American reality.

18:25.406 --> 18:27.507
(Laughing)

18:29.377 --> 18:32.145
Well, Tucker,
it's been nice doing business with...

18:32.179 --> 18:33.480
You!

18:33.514 --> 18:36.383
I can't believe you were married
the whole time we were together!

18:36.417 --> 18:40.020
But now you're gonna pay for
cheating me and our country.

18:42.023 --> 18:43.990
What'chu talkin' 'bout, Sondra?

18:44.025 --> 18:47.060
Your roommates, regular and extra large,

18:47.094 --> 18:49.863
told me all about your
little green-card marriage,

18:49.897 --> 18:51.932
so I called immigration, and guess what?

18:51.966 --> 18:53.667
They're on their way over now.

18:53.701 --> 18:56.603
You are getting deported,
and you are going to prison.

18:56.637 --> 18:57.604
Prison!

18:58.806 --> 19:00.707
Wait, wait, wait,
you're getting me deported?

19:00.741 --> 19:04.311
I can't go back to my country!
I'm wanted for 16 counts of...

19:04.345 --> 19:06.346
Well, doing this kind of thing.

19:06.380 --> 19:08.181
Need a good lawyer?

19:08.215 --> 19:10.150
Oh, wait, you know what?
That's my yogurt punch card.

19:10.184 --> 19:12.419
You know what? I gotta get out of here.

19:12.453 --> 19:16.022
Look, you can have the divorce papers,
just pretend you never saw me.

19:16.057 --> 19:17.157
- Okay, deal?
- Deal.

19:17.191 --> 19:18.258
(Door slamming)

19:18.292 --> 19:19.392
What about me?

19:19.427 --> 19:20.961
I can't go to jail!

19:20.995 --> 19:22.362
You know I can't pee if someone's watching.

19:22.396 --> 19:24.130
(Mouths)

19:25.933 --> 19:27.167
Why would you do this to me?

19:27.201 --> 19:29.035
Because you're the one.

19:29.070 --> 19:31.171
I didn't actually call immigration.

19:31.205 --> 19:32.906
I was just helping you get rid of her.

19:32.940 --> 19:34.207
Wasn't I great, tickle-bear?

19:36.177 --> 19:38.244
Wait, wait, so we're back together?

19:38.279 --> 19:41.181
I know! I'm really excited, too!

19:43.217 --> 19:45.218
Oh, hey, Sondra. What happened here?

19:45.252 --> 19:49.289
Well, Olivia's gone,
and I get to keep Sondra.

19:49.323 --> 19:50.924
(Half-heartedly) Yay.

19:53.160 --> 19:54.361
Look how happy he is!

19:54.395 --> 19:57.030
He's crying!

19:59.000 --> 20:00.166
Wow!

20:00.201 --> 20:02.235
You started off in a relationship,
then you got dumped,

20:02.269 --> 20:04.204
then you got married, then you got divorced,

20:04.238 --> 20:06.272
then you got back together with Sondra!

20:06.307 --> 20:08.308
Man, you can't write this stuff!

20:10.411 --> 20:12.212
Danny, are those my jeans?

20:17.410 --> 20:18.610
Emma, what's my name?

20:18.644 --> 20:20.311
Dada.

20:20.346 --> 20:25.316
You are just the smartest, sweetest,
best baby in the whole world.

20:25.351 --> 20:26.317
I'm serious, man.

20:26.352 --> 20:30.555
I think I might get her
tested for genius... Ness.

20:30.589 --> 20:31.556
Who do you love, Emma?

20:31.590 --> 20:32.724
Dada.

20:32.758 --> 20:35.393
Oh, way to go, Emma!

20:35.428 --> 20:36.628
Dada.

20:41.568 --> 20:43.504
Hey, at least you can skip the genius test.
