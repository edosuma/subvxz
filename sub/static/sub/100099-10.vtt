00:01.262 --> 00:03.612
Previously on
Supergirl...

00:03.655 --> 00:06.528
Dark Kryptonian witches want to resurrect Reign and use her to terraform the Earth,

00:06.571 --> 00:08.225
turning it into a new Krypton.

00:08.269 --> 00:10.227
Leviathan is coming.

00:10.271 --> 00:11.533
You can go, Margot.

00:13.709 --> 00:16.320
When we restarted the universe,
our worlds combined.

00:16.364 --> 00:19.976
The DEO, CatCo,
all of National City is
on this Earth now.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.022
Lex Luthor has
the Book of Destiny.

00:22.065 --> 00:25.547
We thought destiny could use
a little rewrite.

00:25.590 --> 00:28.202
- People think
Lex is a good guy?
-He's the boss!

00:28.245 --> 00:29.681
He owns this place.

00:31.466 --> 00:34.512
We live in a world
on the cutting edge.

00:34.556 --> 00:36.514
And as mankind advances,

00:36.558 --> 00:39.082
so too does the danger
it faces.

00:39.126 --> 00:41.432
For years, we protected
America in secret.

00:41.476 --> 00:44.870
But now, we want you to know
you're in good hands.

00:50.398 --> 00:53.053
Hope, help
and compassion for all.

00:53.096 --> 00:55.185
-That's our motto here at...
-The DEO.

00:55.229 --> 00:57.274
Call us for all
your extranormal needs.

00:59.276 --> 01:02.975
Duh! Gag me with a spoon.
I don't care what
world we're on,

01:03.019 --> 01:06.457
I can't ever see a version
of myself agreeing to do
that commercial.

01:06.501 --> 01:09.765
Well, on this planet,
you and Lex were
excellent collaborators.

01:09.808 --> 01:12.724
No, stop! This is literally
my nightmare.

01:12.768 --> 01:14.204
Okay, well,
how do you think I feel?

01:14.248 --> 01:16.206
I've been totally in the dark.

01:16.250 --> 01:17.947
Thank God J'onn gave me
my memories back.

01:17.990 --> 01:19.818
Yeah, I know, I wish he could
do it for everyone.

01:19.862 --> 01:24.388
Well, according to him,
restoring the world's
collective memories

01:24.432 --> 01:27.435
would reconfigure relationships
on such a massive scale

01:27.478 --> 01:30.220
that everyone's minds
would literally be blown.

01:30.264 --> 01:31.613
Ugh, gross.

01:31.656 --> 01:35.051
Well, the DEO is
a hellmouth now,
so there's that.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.140
-Has CatCo changed?
-Still a tabloid.

01:37.184 --> 01:40.012
But everyone's on
the Lex Luthor train,
which is great.

01:40.056 --> 01:41.579
Including Andrea.

01:41.623 --> 01:43.712
He's getting some
Man of Tomorrow award,

01:43.755 --> 01:45.453
and she sent me
and William to cover it.

01:45.496 --> 01:48.760
I... uh, I can't believe
even William is drinking
the Lex Kool-Aid.

01:48.804 --> 01:51.241
Well, you gotta give him
a little break, okay.

01:51.285 --> 01:54.114
The only people that know
the truth are the ones whose
memories have been restored.

01:54.157 --> 01:56.681
So it's Brainy, Nia, Kelly...

01:56.725 --> 01:58.335
All the heroes
who helped at the Crisis,

01:58.379 --> 02:01.643
including you know who,
which just makes my blood boil.

02:01.686 --> 02:04.254
Well, the Luthors are a breed
of their own.

02:04.298 --> 02:06.343
Yeah, speaking of which,

02:07.953 --> 02:09.477
I have to talk to Lena.

02:09.520 --> 02:12.567
Look, on this Earth,
Lena and Supergirl
are partners.

02:12.610 --> 02:15.613
And as far as I'm concerned,
she's not trying to
mind control the planet.

02:15.657 --> 02:19.313
Plus, she doesn't hate you,
so maybe Lena not having
her memories

02:19.356 --> 02:20.444
is a good thing.

02:20.488 --> 02:22.185
No, no.

02:22.229 --> 02:25.841
As much  as I would
love to have a clean slate
with Lena,

02:26.972 --> 02:29.192
I owe it to her
to tell the truth.

02:29.236 --> 02:31.455
I made that mistake once,
I'm not going to do it again.

02:31.499 --> 02:33.196
- Hey, there, sleepy head.

02:34.676 --> 02:36.417
I fried a couple of eggs
for you.

02:36.460 --> 02:38.984
Methohexital hangovers
are no joke.

02:39.028 --> 02:40.029
You must be ravenous.

02:41.944 --> 02:43.075
This can't be real.

02:44.686 --> 02:45.730
You're dead.

02:46.731 --> 02:48.733
So, you remember everything?

02:48.777 --> 02:50.822
Of course I remember!
I killed you!

02:50.866 --> 02:53.173
Yes, that's right,
you killed me.

02:53.216 --> 02:56.176
But that is all in the past.

02:56.219 --> 02:58.569
-Because I'm back now,

02:58.613 --> 03:00.136
and I forgive you.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.660
What are you talking about?
What is happening?

03:02.704 --> 03:05.750
Well, it was, uh...
sort of a Crisis.

03:06.882 --> 03:10.015
It was an...
antimatter wave.

03:10.059 --> 03:11.800
-Ah, yes.
-Alex and I worked together.

03:11.843 --> 03:13.932
-Mmm-hmm.
-We built a portal...

03:13.976 --> 03:15.543
The wave still came?

03:15.586 --> 03:18.110
Yes, and billions were lost
and the multi-verse collapsed,

03:18.154 --> 03:19.503
and it was all
very interesting.

03:19.547 --> 03:24.029
What matters now
is that a very powerful person

03:24.073 --> 03:26.336
brought me back
to life to help.

03:26.380 --> 03:28.033
But I refused to do so,
unless he promised

03:28.077 --> 03:31.689
that you would
make it through okay,
and you have,

03:31.733 --> 03:33.735
with your noggin intact.

03:33.778 --> 03:36.868
You gambled the fate
of the entire multi-verse
to get your own way?

03:36.912 --> 03:38.348
It gets better.
In this new world,

03:38.392 --> 03:42.396
we work side by side
at Luthor Corp and the DEO

03:42.439 --> 03:44.049
to make the world
a better place.

03:44.093 --> 03:45.181
So I'm in hell.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.749
No, no,
you're in a new reality.

03:47.792 --> 03:51.274
To the outside world,
we're billionaire
philanthropists.

03:51.318 --> 03:52.797
It's the perfect cover.

03:52.841 --> 03:54.973
-I want nothing to do with you.
-Ah, yes, you want to

03:55.017 --> 03:57.628
fix humanity
with your project Non Nocere.

03:57.672 --> 04:01.676
And using Myriad to broadcast
the Q-waves. That was smart.

04:01.719 --> 04:05.201
But you should have known
the moment you decided to steal
from a Kryptonian,

04:05.245 --> 04:07.638
the Non Nocere was doomed.

04:07.682 --> 04:10.554
Kara Danvers will never see
things your way.

04:11.773 --> 04:13.296
She'll always work against you.

04:13.340 --> 04:15.037
Right, so you'll be
my friend now?

04:15.080 --> 04:17.082
The world is ours now, Lena.

04:19.389 --> 04:23.350
You don't need a robot
and you don't need friends.

04:23.393 --> 04:24.655
You need a partner.

04:24.699 --> 04:27.963
Imagine what
we could accomplish together.

04:30.313 --> 04:31.575
Why not give it a go?

04:31.619 --> 04:33.403
So you think
this is your world now?

04:36.493 --> 04:39.322
You were a puppet on a string
for Leviathan before.

04:39.366 --> 04:41.150
What makes this time
any different?

04:43.152 --> 04:44.675
What the hell is Leviathan?

04:52.814 --> 04:55.947
I want you to know
I'll be doubling my efforts
to calibrate my emotions

04:55.991 --> 04:57.906
with my actions.

04:57.949 --> 05:02.040
To wit, your favorite
breakfast smoothie.

05:02.084 --> 05:05.479
And despite every urge
in my corporeal being,

05:05.522 --> 05:07.872
I ordered only two.

05:07.916 --> 05:09.483
Thanks, Brainy.

05:09.526 --> 05:13.269
My good man,
I'm picking up a to-go order
for Barney Fife,

05:13.313 --> 05:14.314
-if anyone asks...
-Halt.

05:16.185 --> 05:18.405
Oh, my.

05:18.448 --> 05:20.755
What?
What is the meaning of this?

05:20.798 --> 05:23.018
-Meaning... I don't--
-Who are you?

05:23.061 --> 05:24.411
-I'm Brainiac-5.
-What?

05:24.454 --> 05:26.674
-Liar!
-You, sir,

05:26.717 --> 05:29.720
are the larcenist
and pretender. How did
you accomplish this ruse?

05:29.764 --> 05:31.809
Could it be an image inducer?

05:31.853 --> 05:34.638
-The question of pretending
is to you, sir!

05:34.682 --> 05:37.772
What are you, huh?
Martian, Durlan?

05:37.815 --> 05:39.339
Is your face made of clay?

05:39.382 --> 05:41.297
Unhand me, you charlatan!

05:41.341 --> 05:43.647
Okay, that's it. I'm taking you
into the DEO for questioning.

05:43.691 --> 05:44.953
Okay, that's rich!
Guess what,

05:44.996 --> 05:46.346
I'm taking you into the DEO
for questioning.

05:46.389 --> 05:47.521
Oh, that's rich...

05:50.872 --> 05:52.352
Citizens arrest!

06:03.101 --> 06:04.451
I've been looking for you.

06:05.539 --> 06:07.671
Here I am.

06:07.715 --> 06:11.632
So, uh, there's something
I have to tell you.

06:11.675 --> 06:13.634
I know you think
Lex is a good man,

06:13.677 --> 06:17.159
-that he's your partner--
-Save it. I already know.

06:17.202 --> 06:19.379
What exactly do you know?

06:19.422 --> 06:21.859
The Crisis, what Lex did.

06:22.599 --> 06:24.209
-What you did.
-Lex.

06:24.253 --> 06:25.776
That you took the punch.

06:25.820 --> 06:27.691
What did you think would
happen when you came here?

06:27.735 --> 06:29.606
That you'd tell me everything
in a fit of selflessness,

06:29.650 --> 06:32.653
even if it meant that I knew
how you betrayed me,

06:32.696 --> 06:35.046
and then I'd just keel over
and forgive you.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.657
Lena, I hurt you. I--

06:37.745 --> 06:38.876
I know I hurt you.

06:38.920 --> 06:41.401
And I'm never ever going
to do it again.

06:41.444 --> 06:44.055
And I know how much good
you want to do in the world.

06:44.099 --> 06:46.841
Just think of what we could do
together to help people.

06:47.624 --> 06:48.625
Funny.

06:50.061 --> 06:51.541
Lex gave me the same pitch.

06:51.585 --> 06:53.064
He asked you to help him?

06:56.590 --> 06:58.374
You're not seriously
considering it, are you?

07:00.594 --> 07:02.378
Please, just be careful.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.735
Director Danvers!

07:13.302 --> 07:15.130
What is going on?

07:15.173 --> 07:16.261
Exactly the correct question.

07:16.305 --> 07:17.480
Paradox to be sure.

07:17.524 --> 07:19.351
There must be a reasonable
explanation.

07:19.395 --> 07:21.266
And we will get one,
once you confess.

07:21.310 --> 07:24.226
Uh, I know I'm gonna regret
asking this question,

07:24.269 --> 07:26.924
but which of you
is my Brainy?

07:26.968 --> 07:28.448
How can you
seriously ask that?

07:28.491 --> 07:29.492
Well...

07:29.536 --> 07:31.146
Get an interrogation
room ready.

07:32.103 --> 07:33.540
I'm sorry,
who the hell are you?

07:33.583 --> 07:36.064
I'm Director Brainiac-5
of the DEO.

07:36.107 --> 07:38.196
I am the Director of the DEO.

07:38.240 --> 07:41.591
Why is everyone yelling!

07:41.635 --> 07:43.767
Oh, you have got
to be sprocking me!

07:45.552 --> 07:48.032
You're all in grave danger.

07:50.121 --> 07:52.167
Don't let him open...

07:52.907 --> 07:54.169
the bottle.

08:05.093 --> 08:06.747
Someone killed him?

08:06.790 --> 08:09.053
He was targeted,
which means any of the
others could be next.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.361
No,
you weren't kidding.

08:12.404 --> 08:13.754
No. Thank you.

08:15.712 --> 08:19.237
DNA doesn't lie,
so you are all Brainiac-5.

08:21.065 --> 08:24.504
This reminds me of a situation
with some crabs on Helven.

08:24.547 --> 08:26.331
Terrible experience.

08:26.375 --> 08:29.900
He seems to have been killed
by some sort
of biosynthetic virus.

08:30.814 --> 08:32.250
The Anti-Life Equation.

08:32.294 --> 08:33.337
The... sorry, what?

08:33.381 --> 08:35.471
It's a techno-organic poison.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.255
It's targeted and transmitted
through the big brain.

08:37.299 --> 08:39.039
It's really scary, man!

08:39.082 --> 08:40.563
I've never heard
of such a thing.

08:40.607 --> 08:42.260
We're supposed to believe
that you're the Brainy Prime?

08:42.304 --> 08:44.611
Well, it's true. He's ours.

08:47.657 --> 08:49.224
Well, then this can't be
our world.

08:49.267 --> 08:50.791
Which means we must have
stumbled through
some sort of...

08:50.834 --> 08:52.488
Dimensional wormhole.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.359
From our different universes.

08:54.403 --> 08:56.536
Wormhole... Universes, yeah.

08:56.579 --> 08:58.929
I'm sorry, guys,
there's a slight crisis--

08:58.973 --> 09:02.019
The only logical path forward
is to find the nexus point
of our arrival,

09:02.063 --> 09:04.544
if we're ever
to ascertain how it is
we came to be here,

09:04.587 --> 09:06.981
why our deceased
comrade warned us
we're in grave danger?

09:07.024 --> 09:09.592
What that bottle was
he urged us not to open?

09:09.636 --> 09:12.247
After which, we can
all safely return
to our respective Earths.

09:12.290 --> 09:14.249
Agreed.

09:14.292 --> 09:16.207
Yes, except you can't return
to your Earths because
the multi-verse is dead.

09:16.251 --> 09:17.382
-So.
- Brainy.

09:19.036 --> 09:22.605
Oh, uh, all right.
That is insensitive.

09:22.649 --> 09:25.347
What? The multi-verse,
it's dead?

09:25.390 --> 09:28.045
Unless there's a vibrational
frequency henceforth

09:28.089 --> 09:30.570
unknown to man, then...

09:30.613 --> 09:32.659
our universe is
the only one that's left.

09:32.702 --> 09:34.965
- Apologies
for the interruption,

09:35.009 --> 09:37.402
but would Director Danvers
and Supergirl, please report

09:37.446 --> 09:38.752
to the conference room
immediately?

09:41.450 --> 09:42.582
What do you want, Lex?

09:49.371 --> 09:51.591
-Peace.
-It's never gonna happen.

09:51.634 --> 09:53.244
Look,  I get it,

09:53.288 --> 09:56.987
feels icky, but why don't
we think about it
in another way?

09:57.031 --> 10:01.078
Why go to war
and make things messy,

10:01.122 --> 10:03.820
when we could all play
a comfortable game
of chess?

10:03.864 --> 10:06.214
You could keep an eye on me,
I could keep an eye on you,

10:06.257 --> 10:08.869
and in the meantime,
the world would have
its favorite heroes

10:08.912 --> 10:12.089
standing shoulder to shoulder
to keep threats like
the Anti-Monitor

10:12.133 --> 10:15.571
and Leviathan at bay.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.574
Say, what's happening
with those guys anyway?
Any rumblings?

10:18.618 --> 10:20.707
The Anti-Monitor is gone.

10:20.750 --> 10:23.840
And we haven't found a trace
of Leviathan since the
multi-verse collapsed. So...

10:23.884 --> 10:26.495
So the only threat
to this world is you.

10:26.538 --> 10:27.627
I'm sorry to hear that.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.371
Look, take a day
to think it over.

10:33.415 --> 10:35.722
And if you choose peace,

10:35.765 --> 10:39.639
I'll expect you by my side,
publicly, at the Man
of Tomorrow ceremony.

10:40.683 --> 10:42.467
But if you don't,

10:42.511 --> 10:45.166
I suppose we'll have
a little more apocalypse.

10:45.209 --> 10:48.778
Eighty-two percent
of customers with cell phone
plans have purchased

10:48.822 --> 10:51.302
our VR add-on.
But we can still do better.

10:51.346 --> 10:55.219
We need to get Obsidian into
every American household,

10:55.263 --> 10:57.091
and we are so close.

10:57.134 --> 10:58.962
Quite close, indeed.

10:59.006 --> 11:01.704
Wha-- what a pleasant surprise!

11:01.748 --> 11:02.836
-Hi!
-Hello!

11:03.837 --> 11:06.535
Team, this is Gemma Cooper,

11:06.578 --> 11:09.320
one of our board members
and my beloved college mentor.

11:09.364 --> 11:11.018
-That's all. Thank you.

11:12.759 --> 11:14.978
Okay, it took some
technical doing,

11:15.022 --> 11:16.632
but I believe
I've confirmed that--

11:16.676 --> 11:19.591
We are the only Brainiac-5s
that came through the wormhole,

11:19.635 --> 11:21.985
which you've now traced
to Al's Bar.

11:22.029 --> 11:24.248
Yeah, we, too, deduced that

11:24.292 --> 11:27.121
several moments ago,
but hey, Al's bar,

11:27.164 --> 11:30.167
I do love
their margarita mocktails.

11:30.211 --> 11:31.691
Perhaps we should go...

11:34.911 --> 11:36.347
Oh! No, no, no, no, no.

11:36.391 --> 11:37.827
Prime, help me
root out the virus.

11:37.871 --> 11:40.177
How? Uh, I don't...

11:41.701 --> 11:46.618
Okay. It's okay. That's okay.
I got you. Here we go.

11:49.317 --> 11:51.493
-Okay.

11:51.536 --> 11:53.538
You know, I could have
died just there.

11:53.582 --> 11:55.062
Thanks to your hesitancy.

11:55.105 --> 11:57.673
We're supposed to believe
that he's a Brainiac-5!

11:57.717 --> 12:00.676
Friends, friends, focus.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.461
The virus is transmittable
from anywhere.

12:03.505 --> 12:04.898
Any one of us could be next.

12:05.855 --> 12:08.292
You, stay here.

12:08.336 --> 12:11.252
We'll head down to Al's bar.
We'll get to the bottom
of this.

12:13.428 --> 12:15.517
-Okay.
-There he goes.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.737
Handsome. Look at him go.

12:24.613 --> 12:25.745
I'll go get Supergirl.

12:29.009 --> 12:30.750
Hey, what's going on here...

12:31.185 --> 12:32.882
Als.

12:32.926 --> 12:34.754
Everybody just showed up
out of the blue last night.

12:34.797 --> 12:36.190
Business has never been better.

12:36.233 --> 12:37.321
I had to open up the back room.

12:37.365 --> 12:39.062
Has this place
always been here?

12:39.106 --> 12:42.805
-Yup. I closed it in '79
after disco died.
-How old are you?

12:42.849 --> 12:45.460
-Shh.
-These guys brought a ton
of stuff with them, though.

12:46.678 --> 12:49.812
-You guys missing anything?
- What fun!

12:55.339 --> 12:57.472
Look, whatever caused
that wormhole

12:57.515 --> 13:00.954
didn't just drag us through,
it dragged everyone
from Al's bar

13:00.997 --> 13:03.304
in each of our universes.

13:03.347 --> 13:05.872
Oh, dear.
Are those...

13:05.915 --> 13:08.744
Don't make
any sudden movements.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.746
Those are the witches
that created Reign.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.617
And tried to terraform
our entire planet.

13:12.661 --> 13:14.794
Those aren't your witches.

13:14.837 --> 13:16.796
They come from my world.

13:16.839 --> 13:19.668
They came
to National City as tourists
and never left.

13:19.711 --> 13:21.844
I let them run a little
side hustle out of the bar.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.933
Come forth, my children.

13:23.977 --> 13:25.587
Have your fortune read.

13:25.630 --> 13:28.546
I prefer to avoid such
unreliable forecasting
mechanisms.

13:28.590 --> 13:30.505
Crystals balls! Ha-ha.

13:30.548 --> 13:33.638
A lot more real
than fool's gold.

13:33.682 --> 13:37.077
Allow me to read your stones.

13:37.120 --> 13:40.080
Please, forgive my sisters.

13:41.342 --> 13:44.780
Palm reading is the
fastest path to your fate.

13:46.129 --> 13:49.089
Five dollars, ten minutes.

13:50.220 --> 13:52.266
Hmm, no thank you.

13:52.309 --> 13:54.921
-Uh, suit yourself.
-Typical.

13:54.964 --> 13:57.488
No one on this Earth
values our gifts.

13:57.532 --> 14:00.404
Everyone in this bar
came from an Earth
that was destroyed.

14:00.448 --> 14:01.710
They're all orphans.

14:03.059 --> 14:04.582
That's terrible.

14:04.626 --> 14:06.671
No, Supergirl!

14:06.715 --> 14:09.849
The entire multi-verse
was destroyed.

14:09.892 --> 14:13.330
An accident of fate kept
us and these people alive.

14:14.070 --> 14:16.072
This isn't a tragedy.

14:16.116 --> 14:18.814
It's a, you know,
it's a miracle.

14:19.902 --> 14:22.078
Okay, we need
to divide and conquer.

14:22.122 --> 14:24.646
And please, try to blend in,

14:24.689 --> 14:26.691
because there is still
a murderer out there

14:26.735 --> 14:28.824
and both of you are
still in danger. Okay?

14:31.740 --> 14:32.784
Good.

14:42.577 --> 14:44.057
I never thought I'd
live to see the day

14:44.100 --> 14:45.362
my mother wore petal pink.

14:45.406 --> 14:46.886
Technically, you didn't.

14:46.929 --> 14:49.192
We all died. We all came back.

14:49.236 --> 14:50.411
And we both know it.

14:50.454 --> 14:52.195
Lex restored
your memories, too.

14:52.239 --> 14:54.284
He told me everything.

14:54.328 --> 14:57.940
But, evidently,
the only person he makes
deals with gods for is you.

14:59.637 --> 15:01.074
I'm glad
he told you everything.

15:02.118 --> 15:03.728
I have no one else.

15:03.772 --> 15:05.469
I hope you're
not looking for a hug.

15:06.993 --> 15:10.474
No. But it occurred to me
I could use a partner.

15:10.518 --> 15:14.261
If Lex told you everything,
then he told you my goal was
to fix people at their core.

15:15.305 --> 15:17.873
I tried to do it alone.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.745
I closed myself off,
made myself an island,
and I failed.

15:20.789 --> 15:23.748
You pushed people away
and put all your faith
in that robot.

15:25.968 --> 15:28.231
Reminds me
of little Miss Pizzly.

15:28.275 --> 15:30.059
Your teddy bear
from when you were four.

15:30.103 --> 15:31.974
Cute and useless.

15:32.018 --> 15:35.108
We both know your ideology
is of no use to me.

15:36.109 --> 15:38.067
I've got
a good thing going here.

15:38.111 --> 15:39.286
Well, in that case...

15:40.809 --> 15:42.680
Supergirl wants
to partner with me.

15:44.769 --> 15:46.075
Part of me wants to do it.

15:46.119 --> 15:50.514
You can try to only be
partners this time,

15:50.558 --> 15:52.734
but in a moment of weakness,

15:52.777 --> 15:55.302
you'll let your guard down,
you'll become friends
once more,

15:55.345 --> 15:58.783
and you'll be vulnerable
when she hurts you
all over again.

15:58.827 --> 16:02.178
And yet,
you don't want to be an island.

16:03.179 --> 16:04.224
No.

16:05.486 --> 16:06.704
I will never trust Lex again.

16:06.748 --> 16:08.402
If you choose
to partner with Lex,

16:09.490 --> 16:12.319
you won't risk your emotions,

16:12.362 --> 16:14.364
because you already know
you can never trust him.

16:16.758 --> 16:19.239
I report to Lex Luthor.

16:19.282 --> 16:22.024
This is worst-case scenario.

16:22.068 --> 16:25.462
I don't know how I'm supposed
to work for him,

16:25.506 --> 16:27.464
and yet we all know
that he's this bomb

16:27.508 --> 16:29.205
that could just blow
at any minute.

16:29.249 --> 16:31.555
So, I mean,
can I even really leave?

16:31.599 --> 16:33.993
You know, long before
I recruited you,

16:34.036 --> 16:37.909
an alien named Izzy was held
captive by her co-worker.

16:37.953 --> 16:39.694
Now, he'd found out
what she really was

16:39.737 --> 16:41.913
and couldn't control his rage.

16:41.957 --> 16:44.438
Izzy was naturally terrified.

16:44.481 --> 16:46.744
But because
her attacker was human,

16:46.788 --> 16:48.659
the DEO didn't have
jurisdiction.

16:48.703 --> 16:50.096
Things were different
back then.

16:51.140 --> 16:53.055
I felt so helpless.

16:53.969 --> 16:55.536
So what did you do?

16:55.579 --> 16:57.320
What I knew I had to do.

16:57.364 --> 16:59.322
I disobeyed orders.

16:59.366 --> 17:03.674
Ran in there and tackled
that man to the ground myself.

17:03.718 --> 17:08.243
Sometimes there's nothing to do
but listen to the truth
inside you, Alex.

17:08.288 --> 17:11.247
The honor comes in running
toward the bomb.

17:40.885 --> 17:44.759
Seven hundred
and sixty-two bottles of beer
on the wall.

17:44.802 --> 17:46.761
And they're all completely
lacking in clues.

17:47.762 --> 17:49.024
Talking to yourself.

17:50.156 --> 17:51.896
You can talk to me
instead, if you'd like.

17:51.940 --> 17:53.202
I'm you, after all.

17:53.246 --> 17:54.986
Ignored us all day,
and now you want to talk.

17:55.030 --> 17:57.119
I see you.

17:57.163 --> 18:00.209
You've been one step behind
the rest of us at every turn.

18:00.253 --> 18:01.863
What is making you different?

18:03.386 --> 18:04.953
It's not a big deal
or anything,

18:06.346 --> 18:07.434
but I do wear...

18:12.395 --> 18:13.788
Personality inhibiters.

18:13.831 --> 18:15.006
I knew it.

18:18.271 --> 18:19.837
Why would you wear those?

18:20.969 --> 18:22.927
-For protection.
-Protection?

18:22.971 --> 18:26.888
Personality inhibitors
block you from engaging
with the big brain.

18:26.931 --> 18:29.325
They stop you from accessing
your true self.

18:29.369 --> 18:31.632
Your true potential,
your true happiness.

18:33.155 --> 18:36.289
Don't you ever
feel inconsistent?

18:36.332 --> 18:38.943
Uncertain?
Unable to balance logic
and emotion?

18:38.987 --> 18:41.381
I mean, look at you,
you're not even green.

18:41.424 --> 18:44.297
Okay, sure.
And what about the anger?

18:44.340 --> 18:45.776
Hmm? The rage?

18:45.820 --> 18:48.083
I don't wear these
to protect myself!

18:48.127 --> 18:50.085
I wear them to protect
the people I love.

18:52.653 --> 18:54.611
Where I'm from, I was married.

18:54.655 --> 18:58.137
I was stronger, smarter,
better, every moment
I was with her.

19:00.313 --> 19:01.836
-You lost her?
-No.

19:03.664 --> 19:04.708
She's with me.

19:07.233 --> 19:09.148
She lives on in the big brain.

19:10.584 --> 19:12.673
Just as I will,
when my work here is finished.

19:15.502 --> 19:19.723
What I'm saying
is love is not meant
to minimize you.

19:20.637 --> 19:22.378
It makes you more.

19:22.422 --> 19:25.120
More capable.
More compassionate.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.687
And the people
who really love you,

19:29.603 --> 19:30.821
they don't want this for you.

19:34.782 --> 19:36.305
I appreciate the chat, Kor-El,

19:37.437 --> 19:39.352
but I feel very capable
as I am.

19:39.395 --> 19:40.309
Suit yourself.

19:43.007 --> 19:45.053
A hologram, this whole time.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.491
Now I see how rude that is.

19:51.929 --> 19:54.193
I always thought
my Brainy was one of a kind.

19:55.542 --> 19:58.893
I'm sorry, I'm Nia.

19:58.936 --> 20:00.808
My Brainy filled me in
on everything

20:00.851 --> 20:03.767
and I just had to see
you all for myself.

20:05.160 --> 20:07.510
I brought lunch. You hungry?

20:07.554 --> 20:10.426
No, I...  sorry.

20:11.427 --> 20:15.301
I just wanna
be alone right now.

20:15.344 --> 20:18.042
He also said something
about a bottle.

20:18.086 --> 20:20.436
A bottle.

20:29.271 --> 20:30.533
Alas...

20:32.883 --> 20:35.756
You have caught me in the act.

20:35.799 --> 20:36.974
But I'm glad.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.499
The act was

20:40.587 --> 20:42.763
emotionally exhausting.

20:45.505 --> 20:46.549
What's in the bottle?

20:46.593 --> 20:48.551
Seven billion souls
on my Earth.

20:50.161 --> 20:51.728
All here.

20:51.772 --> 20:53.426
Bottled at the source.

20:53.469 --> 20:56.385
Moments before
the antimatter wave came.

20:58.909 --> 21:00.476
No more waiting.

21:00.520 --> 21:03.958
Sweet release.

21:04.959 --> 21:06.787
You bottled your world.

21:06.830 --> 21:08.049
I saved them.

21:10.138 --> 21:13.576
Prevented genocide.

21:13.620 --> 21:17.101
Now, stuck in stasis,
is that truly life?

21:18.755 --> 21:20.409
Or is it just

21:20.453 --> 21:23.499
some hideous form
of distasteful death?

21:23.543 --> 21:25.196
Why don't we take it upstairs?

21:26.459 --> 21:28.417
We can hash out the
philosophy there.

21:28.461 --> 21:30.332
There is nothing to hash.

21:30.376 --> 21:31.594
There is only life.

21:34.336 --> 21:35.381
And death.

21:38.645 --> 21:41.300
Take the other Brainiac-5.

21:41.343 --> 21:44.651
He tried to prevent me
from opening this bottle,
so I killed him.

21:44.694 --> 21:45.695
Death!

21:47.001 --> 21:49.569
But once I find the device

21:49.612 --> 21:52.006
with which to open
this bottle,

21:54.443 --> 21:55.401
life...

22:01.842 --> 22:02.843
Brainy!

22:05.672 --> 22:06.629
Nia.

22:20.077 --> 22:21.514
No!

22:24.386 --> 22:25.256
Nia.

22:33.439 --> 22:36.529
He was piggybacking off
Brainy Prime's
personality inhibitors

22:36.572 --> 22:39.488
to confuse the big brain
and disguise
his true intentions.

22:39.532 --> 22:40.968
What were his intentions?

22:41.011 --> 22:42.361
He shrunk his entire Earth.

22:43.623 --> 22:45.233
He bottled it.

22:45.276 --> 22:47.496
The shrinking and collection
of worlds is distinctly Coluan.

22:47.540 --> 22:49.977
It's a terribly common practice
among our ancestors.

22:50.020 --> 22:53.502
But this Brainy bottled
his world to protect it?

22:53.546 --> 22:55.548
Yeah, but if he releases
his Earth,

22:55.591 --> 22:57.201
both Earths will be destroyed.

22:57.245 --> 22:58.855
But he couldn't
open the bottle.

22:58.899 --> 23:00.596
Indeed, all bottles are sealed
beneath the quantum level to--

23:00.640 --> 23:02.468
Prevent escape.

23:02.511 --> 23:06.210
Bottles can only be opened
using a device that harnesses
Argonium 44.

23:06.254 --> 23:09.300
He must have known the Argonium
Saber would be held here
at the DEO.

23:09.344 --> 23:11.520
That saber is the only one
that I am aware of
in the solar system.

23:11.564 --> 23:14.393
And I destroyed it,
so that bought us some time.

23:15.829 --> 23:16.743
Brainy.

23:19.746 --> 23:21.225
It's incredible.

23:21.269 --> 23:22.923
It's like being
on the moon.

23:24.098 --> 23:25.882
Except for the lack
of gravity.

23:25.926 --> 23:27.449
We're still figuring that out.

23:27.493 --> 23:29.016
But we're making
incredible progress.

23:32.715 --> 23:36.589
Progress isn't just Obsidian
being in every household.

23:36.632 --> 23:39.418
It's about every household
being in Obsidian.

23:40.549 --> 23:42.943
-What do you mean?
-Tell me something.

23:42.986 --> 23:44.858
If you never had to work
for your father,

23:46.250 --> 23:49.036
what would Andrea Rojas
want to be right now?

23:49.079 --> 23:50.037
An anthropologist.

23:51.908 --> 23:54.345
Oh, I love it.

23:54.389 --> 23:57.436
You can live on
a sprawling hacienda,

23:57.479 --> 23:59.786
close to your latest
Aztec dig site.

24:01.265 --> 24:02.963
-It's a pleasant dream.
-Not a dream.

24:04.094 --> 24:07.228
A reality.
In a true virtual world.

24:07.271 --> 24:10.579
When someone holds
an artifact that you found,

24:10.623 --> 24:13.539
they feel its weight
in their actual hand.

24:13.582 --> 24:16.063
Imagine a whole new world,

24:16.106 --> 24:18.631
a whole new reality for

24:18.674 --> 24:20.459
harmed and damaged people.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.463
They can live
their dream lives.

24:26.508 --> 24:29.424
And eventually,
they could stay there.

24:30.512 --> 24:31.644
Indefinitely.

24:33.341 --> 24:34.516
A collective of being.

24:36.257 --> 24:38.564
A true virtual world
will change the game.

24:38.607 --> 24:39.782
What do I always tell you?

24:40.827 --> 24:42.002
You gotta move the needle.

24:43.351 --> 24:44.352
And with this...

24:45.788 --> 24:47.747
Our share prices could double.

24:51.577 --> 24:53.927
Brainy, stop.
You don't have to...

24:57.713 --> 25:00.020
When I was eight years old,

25:01.195 --> 25:03.153
my family went on...

25:05.199 --> 25:07.114
what humans might
call a vacation.

25:07.157 --> 25:10.378
This was the first time
I had seen the snow.

25:10.421 --> 25:11.684
It was incredible.

25:13.207 --> 25:14.338
Why are you telling me this?

25:17.211 --> 25:20.214
'Cause my mother saw
how much I loved it.

25:20.257 --> 25:21.432
How badly I...

25:22.825 --> 25:24.914
I wanted to stay there
in the snow.

25:28.396 --> 25:30.833
And so, she bottled it for me.

25:32.618 --> 25:34.533
-The entire planet.
-Brainy...

25:34.576 --> 25:37.797
My father was horrified
at what she had done.

25:37.840 --> 25:38.928
He freed the planet.

25:40.234 --> 25:43.193
I was so young
and angry with him...

25:44.717 --> 25:48.547
for taking away my planet.

25:48.590 --> 25:50.592
My planet!

25:51.985 --> 25:53.595
And that anger terrified him.

25:53.639 --> 25:57.120
He feared that I, too,
could hold such
darkness within me.

25:59.906 --> 26:01.472
That I could become my mother.

26:05.041 --> 26:08.741
So he placed three
personality inhibitors on me.

26:10.960 --> 26:12.832
The same ones I wear
to this very day.

26:12.875 --> 26:14.050
Your three dots.

26:14.094 --> 26:16.270
When I wear them,
I'm not fully calibrated

26:16.313 --> 26:19.360
with the Coluan network
of minds, the big brain.

26:21.884 --> 26:23.625
If I hadn't been wearing them,

26:23.669 --> 26:27.237
that bad Brainy wouldn't
have been able to fool us.

26:27.281 --> 26:28.717
And you're afraid
to take them off?

26:28.761 --> 26:31.285
Because I might be worse.
And Nia, she...

26:33.113 --> 26:34.505
She might not care for me.

26:34.549 --> 26:36.464
Brainy, you are good
to your core.

26:36.507 --> 26:38.727
You will never be your mother.

26:38.771 --> 26:40.903
-How could you be sure?
-Because you're loved.

26:40.947 --> 26:44.385
And the people that love you
will always fight for you.

26:47.954 --> 26:49.129
Thank you, Kara.

26:51.784 --> 26:54.700
Your ability to instill hope
and comfort with
your words is...

26:55.744 --> 26:57.311
is nothing short of magic.

26:59.705 --> 27:02.229
-Magic.
- The witches
can open the bottle.

27:02.272 --> 27:03.447
He's going to Al's.

27:04.666 --> 27:06.668
We have to tell
the other Brainys.

27:06.712 --> 27:10.063
No, I, I need to do this alone.

27:12.761 --> 27:14.154
-But you should come, too.
-I'm coming.

27:29.169 --> 27:30.561
Why are you helping him?

27:30.605 --> 27:32.825
You could have
a peaceful life here.

27:32.868 --> 27:35.218
The Crisis brought us
to a strange world.

27:35.262 --> 27:38.134
If the Coluan is successful,
he will return us home.

27:38.178 --> 27:40.484
Opening that bottle
isn't worth the risk.

27:40.528 --> 27:42.922
Yes, it is.

27:42.965 --> 27:44.445
You could kill everyone.

27:44.488 --> 27:46.229
Why should this Earth live,

27:47.013 --> 27:48.710
when every other died?

27:48.754 --> 27:50.277
'Cause it's the only one
we've got left!

27:50.320 --> 27:52.192
Enough talk.

27:52.235 --> 27:55.325
It's been ages since we had
a good bar fight.

28:05.466 --> 28:06.423
Wait!

28:19.872 --> 28:21.656
We can't undo the past.

28:21.700 --> 28:22.570
Watch us.

28:39.805 --> 28:41.502
-Brainy.

28:51.686 --> 28:53.296
-Brainy.

28:53.340 --> 28:54.602
This is all my fault.

29:10.444 --> 29:12.489
Brainy, it's okay.

29:14.709 --> 29:15.884
You can take them off.

29:17.843 --> 29:21.237
But what if I turn...

29:21.281 --> 29:25.067
No matter what happens,
I love you.

30:07.631 --> 30:08.807
No, don't!

30:10.939 --> 30:12.506
I know you lost
your whole world,

30:13.507 --> 30:15.248
your friends, your home.

30:16.336 --> 30:18.077
I miss what I had, too.

30:18.120 --> 30:20.296
I know what
you're going through.

30:21.471 --> 30:23.082
How responsible you must feel.

30:23.125 --> 30:24.735
You don't know anything!

30:29.697 --> 30:32.700
But I know everything
because I'm you.

30:35.137 --> 30:36.443
I feel the darkness, too.

30:38.749 --> 30:41.622
You've made some bad choices,
but they don't have
to define you.

30:46.670 --> 30:49.848
I lost everything.

30:53.939 --> 30:55.549
It's not too late
to make a different choice.

30:58.247 --> 30:59.466
Let us help you.

31:02.382 --> 31:06.212
My friends and I,
we're pretty smart.

31:06.255 --> 31:09.737
Together, we can find a safe
place to open your bottle

31:09.780 --> 31:10.738
without hurting anyone.

31:11.957 --> 31:14.002
The suave one
is right.

31:14.046 --> 31:16.483
It is too much of a risk.

31:16.526 --> 31:18.050
But if we give these people
a chance,

31:18.093 --> 31:21.662
they may find a way
of returning us home one day.

31:21.705 --> 31:23.403
All we can do
is wait for that day.

31:24.839 --> 31:26.232
But you don't
have to wait alone,

31:27.233 --> 31:28.495
we can wait with you.

32:21.635 --> 32:25.944
Supergirl and Dreamer are
bringing the bottle to
the fortress for safekeeping.

32:25.987 --> 32:29.817
Which solves the problem
of one errant Brainiac-5.

32:31.297 --> 32:32.602
We were thinking that, too.

32:40.567 --> 32:41.872
Life projectors.

32:42.612 --> 32:44.963
Our worlds may be gone,

32:45.006 --> 32:48.140
but the big brain remains.

32:48.183 --> 32:54.885
A digital cloud where
Ms. Dox and I can relinquish
our corporeal forms

32:54.929 --> 32:57.584
and live amongst the Coluan
knowledge aggregate.

32:57.627 --> 32:59.455
-You don't have to do that.
-We want to.

32:59.499 --> 33:01.022
We may have lost our worlds,

33:01.066 --> 33:04.983
but existing inside
of the big brain
will feel like...

33:06.158 --> 33:07.333
like going home.

33:08.116 --> 33:09.030
Thank you.

33:09.944 --> 33:10.945
Both of you.

33:12.077 --> 33:13.339
For everything.

33:13.382 --> 33:15.732
Thank you, Brainiac-5,

33:15.776 --> 33:19.345
and, uh, sorry for trying
to take your smoothie.

33:38.755 --> 33:40.757
What a strange sensation.

33:40.801 --> 33:42.020
There's something
you need to know.

33:44.892 --> 33:48.809
The reason I left the two
of you to face today's
threat alone

33:48.852 --> 33:52.291
is because I've been tracking
Lex Luthor's every move.

33:52.334 --> 33:56.860
He's been calling the archive
for information on only
one thing, Leviathan.

33:56.904 --> 33:58.079
Leviathan is defeated.

33:58.123 --> 34:00.342
Leviathan is everywhere.

34:00.386 --> 34:04.042
The timeline of our worlds
is closer than any other.

34:04.085 --> 34:06.174
Events progress
on the same path.

34:06.218 --> 34:08.002
You must not make
the same mistakes I made.

34:10.351 --> 34:12.876
I fought against Lex Luthor,

34:12.920 --> 34:14.965
and it led to catastrophe
beyond imagining.

34:15.009 --> 34:17.141
It endangered the entire world.

34:17.185 --> 34:19.187
If you're gonna save
your world,

34:20.667 --> 34:23.190
you have to work
with Lex Luthor.

34:23.235 --> 34:25.150
I'll show you everything
you need to know.

34:25.193 --> 34:27.630
I'll show you everything I did
wrong in my world,
how bad things became.

34:29.719 --> 34:30.764
But Kor-El.

34:33.418 --> 34:35.899
Kor-El, you must do this alone.

34:35.943 --> 34:38.380
No one can know
that you're doing this.

34:38.424 --> 34:42.514
You must give up everyone
and everything that
you hold dear.

34:42.993 --> 34:43.994
Even Nia?

34:46.214 --> 34:47.650
Till the world has been saved.

34:48.695 --> 34:49.783
I'm sorry.

34:51.176 --> 34:52.090
Kor-El,

34:53.438 --> 34:55.092
you'll never truly be alone.

35:01.577 --> 35:03.275
-I will be with you.

35:26.472 --> 35:29.649
Aren't you supposed to be
at a ceremony or something?

35:29.692 --> 35:33.131
Success isn't worth much
if you don't have anyone
to share it with.

35:34.567 --> 35:37.265
I always wanted to share
my victories with you, sis.

35:37.309 --> 35:41.095
Even last year,
with the Kasnians,
I brought you in.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.923
Doesn't that count
for anything?

35:42.966 --> 35:46.187
One moment of thoughtfulness
to make up for
years of betrayal? No.

35:46.231 --> 35:48.320
I know you have plenty
of reasons to distrust me,

35:48.363 --> 35:49.582
but you don't know
what it's like to...

35:51.584 --> 35:53.934
die.

35:53.977 --> 35:56.632
The sickening desperation
when you see it coming for you.

35:56.676 --> 35:57.981
It made me want to lash out.

35:59.548 --> 36:00.810
It made me want to hurt you.

36:00.854 --> 36:02.464
Like I hurt you.

36:02.508 --> 36:05.902
Killed me.
But that's exactly my point.

36:05.946 --> 36:08.905
Death truly has changed me.

36:08.949 --> 36:12.692
The old me would be dreaming
of the myriad ways I could
exact my revenge on you,

36:12.735 --> 36:17.523
but the new me can see
how pathetically pedestrian
that is.

36:19.133 --> 36:21.353
I'm finally ready to be
a true partner, Lena.

36:26.358 --> 36:28.055
How am I supposed
to believe you?

36:28.925 --> 36:31.406
You were a sociopath, a liar.

36:31.450 --> 36:33.669
What you need is the truth.

36:41.982 --> 36:44.724
The Truth Seeker will prevent
me from lying.

36:48.902 --> 36:52.210
So, sis, what do you
want to know?

36:52.253 --> 36:54.124
Can you help me
achieve Non Nocere?

36:54.168 --> 36:55.996
Better and faster
than anybody else.

36:56.039 --> 36:58.303
Will you truly be
on your best behavior?
No homicides?

36:58.346 --> 37:00.218
No unnecessary homicides.

37:00.261 --> 37:02.002
This is about doing no harm.

37:02.045 --> 37:05.005
But I won't. I have everything
I want except for
your partnership.

37:05.048 --> 37:06.398
When will you turn on me?

37:06.441 --> 37:09.227
As soon as this partnership
inconveniences me.

37:09.270 --> 37:12.360
Just like you'll use
Non Nocere on me
as soon as you get the chance.

37:13.274 --> 37:15.581
Good. As long as we're clear.

37:19.498 --> 37:22.327
You don't need me.
Why do you really want
to work with me?

37:22.370 --> 37:23.284
Truthfully,

37:24.981 --> 37:26.244
I don't want to be alone.

37:36.732 --> 37:38.125
-Hey.
-Hello.

37:40.475 --> 37:41.520
How do you feel?

37:43.043 --> 37:45.001
-Uninhibited?
-Something like that.

37:45.045 --> 37:48.440
You know, I'm really glad
to see you so comfortable
in your own skin.

37:50.311 --> 37:52.270
It's all I ever
really wanted for you

37:53.445 --> 37:55.229
was to be able to be yourself.

37:58.014 --> 38:00.103
And now I am.

38:00.147 --> 38:02.715
I can feel it,
all through my body.

38:02.758 --> 38:03.890
The tips of my fingers.

38:06.675 --> 38:09.461
And now, some things
are gonna have to change, Nia.

38:09.504 --> 38:12.638
Of course. Look, Brainy,
whatever you need,

38:12.681 --> 38:13.595
we'll work it out.

38:14.770 --> 38:15.641
Together.

38:17.686 --> 38:19.209
Together... that's...

38:21.342 --> 38:22.430
That's what has to change.

38:23.562 --> 38:25.477
-What?
-I can't be with
you anymore.

38:29.655 --> 38:30.830
I don't understand.

38:36.662 --> 38:37.663
Who are you?

38:42.058 --> 38:45.061
For the first time, ever,

38:48.195 --> 38:49.239
myself.

39:04.385 --> 39:06.387
Welcome, everyone.

39:06.431 --> 39:08.389
It gives me great pleasure
to be here tonight.

39:08.433 --> 39:10.348
Hey, what are
you doing over here?

39:10.391 --> 39:12.045
I just, uh...

39:13.525 --> 39:16.658
Look, I know you're gonna
think I'm crazy,

39:16.702 --> 39:19.661
but I'm not so sure Lex Luthor
is what he says he is.

39:19.705 --> 39:22.011
-What?
- ...with the deeds
of just a few people...

39:22.055 --> 39:26.189
I thought you loved him
like everyone else.

39:26.233 --> 39:28.627
While I was still
at The Timesin London,

39:28.670 --> 39:31.064
Lex tried to buy my friend,
Russell Roger's company.

39:32.108 --> 39:35.373
Russell refused
and ended up dead.

39:37.026 --> 39:39.028
I think Lex Luthor
was behind it.

39:39.072 --> 39:40.508
Do you have
any concrete evidence?

39:40.552 --> 39:42.162
Not yet.

39:42.205 --> 39:44.077
That's why I applied
to work at CatCo,

39:44.120 --> 39:47.863
to get closer to Lena Luthor,
but then she sold the company
to Andrea,

39:47.907 --> 39:51.867
and now, I could use your help.

39:51.911 --> 39:54.392
But someone has to protect
the world from the Luthors.

39:54.435 --> 39:57.786
Not the Luthors, Lex.

39:57.830 --> 40:01.964
I know Lena. She's in just
as much danger
as everyone else.

40:02.008 --> 40:05.490
The guest of honor and I
have already accomplished
so much in the past.

40:05.533 --> 40:08.318
And I'm looking forward
to seeing what we will
achieve in the future.

40:09.581 --> 40:11.278
She was leaning towards
the Kryptonian.

40:12.453 --> 40:15.238
-You're welcome.
-You're too good to me.

40:15.282 --> 40:17.589
We were partners
when we took over
the last world...

40:17.632 --> 40:19.373
Ladies and gentlemen,
allow me to introduce...

40:19.417 --> 40:21.375
...why shouldn't we be partners
in this one, too?

40:21.419 --> 40:23.464
...my brother,
my partner,

40:23.508 --> 40:25.727
Lex Luthor,
the Man of Tomorrow.

40:35.258 --> 40:38.305
Oh, how can I help you,
Agent Dox?

40:40.133 --> 40:42.004
My friends
will work against you.

40:44.093 --> 40:46.182
You know it. I know it.

40:48.489 --> 40:50.273
But they're shortsighted.

40:50.317 --> 40:51.840
The true threat. The...

40:53.146 --> 40:56.454
The only threat that matters
is Leviathan.

40:58.717 --> 41:00.283
I'd like to help you
defeat them.

41:00.327 --> 41:01.241
Well...

41:03.112 --> 41:04.070
that's good to hear.

41:06.159 --> 41:10.772
But no information
about Leviathan exists

41:10.816 --> 41:11.904
in this new world...

41:12.905 --> 41:14.167
at this time.

41:15.473 --> 41:17.126
I need knowledge
from the future.

41:19.520 --> 41:24.264
I have reason to believe
a particular doppelganger
came through the wormhole.

41:24.307 --> 41:27.876
He's already been arrested,
but if we play our cards right,

41:29.704 --> 41:32.272
we can bring the future to us.
