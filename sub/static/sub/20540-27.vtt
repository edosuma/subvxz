00:33.100 --> 00:34.266
WELCOME, WELCOME

00:34.266 --> 00:35.800
TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:35.800 --> 00:36.433
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:36.433 --> 00:37.000
THANK YOU SO MUCH

00:37.000 --> 00:38.734
FOR JOINING US.

00:38.734 --> 00:39.967
IT HAS BEEN YET ANOTHER

00:39.967 --> 00:40.800
HECTIC WEEK, FROM WILDFIRES

00:40.800 --> 00:42.200
IN CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUING

00:42.200 --> 00:44.133
PROBLEMS IN PUERTO RICO

00:44.133 --> 00:45.033
TO MORE HORRIFYING DETAILS

00:45.033 --> 00:46.600
CONCERNING HARVEY WEINSTEIN.

00:46.600 --> 00:48.266
AND IT'S NOT JUST HIS BEHAVIOR

00:48.266 --> 00:49.433
THAT WAS TROUBLING.

00:49.433 --> 00:50.600
IT'S THE WAY THE PEOPLE AROUND

00:50.600 --> 00:52.900
HIM EXCUSED HIS BEHAVIOR.

00:52.900 --> 00:56.800
AND NOTHING'S MORE EMBLEMATIC OF

00:56.800 --> 00:57.667
THAT THAN THE STORY

00:57.667 --> 00:58.433
TOLD BY ACTRESS ANGIE EVERHART.

00:58.433 --> 00:59.233
>> SHE SAYS WHILE SHE WAS

00:59.233 --> 01:00.533
SLEEPING ON A BOAT AT THE CANNES

01:00.533 --> 01:01.400
FILM FESTIVAL, WEINSTEIN BROKE

01:01.400 --> 01:03.166
INTO HER ROOM AND MASTURBATED

01:03.166 --> 01:04.800
IN FRONT OF HER.

01:04.800 --> 01:06.367
>> I TOLD PEOPLE ON THE BOAT.

01:06.367 --> 01:07.533
I TOLD PEOPLE AT THE DINNER

01:07.533 --> 01:09.667
I WAS AT, AND EVERYONE WAS LIKE,

01:09.667 --> 01:11.400
"OH, THAT'S JUST HARVEY."

01:11.400 --> 01:13.133
>> John: WHAT THE FUCK?

01:13.133 --> 01:14.700
SO EVERYONE KNEW, AND THEY JUST

01:14.700 --> 01:16.266
WENT WITH IT?

01:16.266 --> 01:17.467
"YEAH, HARVEY'S GONNA BURST INTO

01:17.467 --> 01:18.934
YOUR ROOM AND MASTURBATE.

01:18.934 --> 01:21.100
THAT'S JUST HARVEY."

01:21.100 --> 01:22.367
HE'S LIKE A SEX-CRIMINAL VERSION

01:22.367 --> 01:25.266
OF THE KOOL-AID MAN.

01:25.266 --> 01:26.633
AND WHILE MOST NOW HAVE

01:26.633 --> 01:27.967
CONDEMNED WEINSTEIN'S BEHAVIOR,

01:27.967 --> 01:29.033
INCREDIBLY, SOME INITIALLY TRIED

01:29.033 --> 01:30.433
TO DEFEND HIM, FROM OLIVER

01:30.433 --> 01:32.400
STONE, WHOSE FIRST RESPONSE WAS,

01:32.400 --> 01:34.100
"IT'S NOT EASY WHAT HE'S GOING

01:35.867 --> 01:37.800
DONNA KARAN, WHO TOOK AN

01:37.800 --> 01:39.633
INCREDIBLE TACK.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.300
>> HOW DO WE DISPLAY OURSELVES?

01:41.300 --> 01:42.133
HOW DO WE PRESENT OURSELVES

01:42.133 --> 01:43.266
AS WOMEN?

01:43.266 --> 01:45.100
WHAT ARE WE ASKING?

01:45.100 --> 01:46.433
ARE WE ASKING FOR IT?

01:46.433 --> 01:47.433
IT'S NOT HARVEY WEINSTEIN.

01:47.433 --> 01:49.333
YOU LOOK AT EVERYTHING, ALL OVER

01:49.333 --> 01:51.934
THE WORLD TODAY AND HOW WOMEN

01:51.934 --> 01:54.333
ARE DRESSING AND WHAT THEY'RE

01:54.333 --> 01:58.767
ASKING BY JUST PRESENTING

01:58.767 --> 01:59.900
THEMSELVES THE WAY THEY DO.

01:59.900 --> 02:01.166
>> John: EXCUSE ME?

02:01.166 --> 02:02.633
ONE, THAT'S ABSOLUTELY

02:02.633 --> 02:05.600
APPALLING.

02:05.600 --> 02:06.467
AND TWO, HOW WOULD DONNA KARAN

02:06.467 --> 02:07.033
KNOW HOW WOMEN ARE DRESSING

02:07.033 --> 02:08.734
RIGHT NOW?

02:08.734 --> 02:11.734
IT'S NOT 1993.

02:11.734 --> 02:13.233
HER MOST RECENT WORK

02:13.233 --> 02:14.934
INCLUDED THIS HAT.

02:14.934 --> 02:15.867
"WELL, HOWDY THERE,

02:17.400 --> 02:18.500

02:18.500 --> 02:21.066

02:21.066 --> 02:22.166
NOW, BOTH STONE AND KARAN DID

02:22.166 --> 02:23.200
LATER APOLOGIZE FOR THEIR

02:23.200 --> 02:25.266
REMARKS, AND JUST YESTERDAY,

02:25.266 --> 02:26.367
THE MOTION PICTURE ACADEMY

02:26.367 --> 02:28.500
MADE A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT.

02:28.500 --> 02:29.200
>> THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS VOTING

02:31.867 --> 02:34.200

02:34.200 --> 02:35.233
SAYING THE ERA OF WILLFUL

02:35.233 --> 02:36.433

02:36.433 --> 02:38.467
COMPLICITY IN SEXUALLY PREDATORY

02:38.467 --> 02:40.934
BEHAVIOR AND HARASSMENT

02:40.934 --> 02:43.667
IN OUR INDUSTRY IS OVER.

02:43.667 --> 02:44.767
>> John: YES, FINALLY.

02:44.767 --> 02:45.834

02:45.834 --> 02:46.700
ITS CURRENT MEMBERS

02:46.700 --> 02:48.767
ROMAN POLANSKI, BILL COSBY

02:48.767 --> 02:50.266

02:50.266 --> 02:52.333

02:52.333 --> 02:54.166
AND KICKED HIM OUT.

02:54.166 --> 02:56.200
SO, CONGRATULATIONS, HOLLYWOOD!

02:56.200 --> 02:58.000
SEE YOU AT THE NEXT OSCARS,

02:58.000 --> 02:59.367
WHERE, AND THIS IS TRUE,

02:59.367 --> 03:00.934
CASEY AFFLECK WILL BE PRESENTING

03:00.934 --> 03:03.133
BEST ACTRESS!

03:03.133 --> 03:03.967
SO FOR NOW, LET MOVE ON

03:03.967 --> 03:05.767
TO PRESIDENT TRUMP:

03:05.767 --> 03:07.133
THE SILVER LINING FOR ANYONE

03:07.133 --> 03:10.033
WHO DIED IN 2015.

03:10.033 --> 03:12.867
HE SPENT HIS WEEK CONTINUING

03:12.867 --> 03:14.200
EFFORTS TO SABOTAGE OBAMA-ERA

03:14.200 --> 03:15.633
POLICIES, BEGINNING WITH

03:15.633 --> 03:16.500
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.

03:16.500 --> 03:17.667
FIRST, HE SIGNED AN

03:17.667 --> 03:18.467
EXECUTIVE ORDER INTENDED TO MAKE

03:18.467 --> 03:19.667
IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO BUY

03:19.667 --> 03:21.834
CHEAPER, SHITTIER HEALTH CARE

03:21.834 --> 03:23.166
PLANS, WHICH, BASED ON

03:23.166 --> 03:25.000
HIS SIGNATURE, HE DID BY PUTTING

03:25.000 --> 03:25.767
A PEN IN HIS MOUTH AND HAVING

03:25.767 --> 03:27.734
A SEIZURE.

03:27.734 --> 03:29.033
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,

03:29.033 --> 03:30.133
HE ALSO DECIDED TO ELIMINATE

03:30.133 --> 03:31.834
$7 BILLION IN SUBSIDY PAYMENTS

03:31.834 --> 03:33.367
TO INSURANCE COMPANIES,

03:33.367 --> 03:37.066
SUBSIDIES WHICH HELP OFFSET

03:37.066 --> 03:37.967
HEALTH CARE EXPENSES FOR AROUND

03:37.967 --> 03:39.367
7 MILLION AMERICANS, AND

03:39.367 --> 03:41.100
REDUCE PREMIUMS FOR MANY MORE.

03:41.100 --> 03:42.200
AND THE RESULTS OF THAT COULD BE

03:42.200 --> 03:43.100
SEVERE.

03:43.100 --> 03:43.800
>> THE NONPARTISAN CONGRESSIONAL

03:43.800 --> 03:45.400
BUDGET OFFICE HAS ESTIMATED

03:45.400 --> 03:47.166
ENDING THESE SUBSIDIES WILL

03:47.166 --> 03:49.867
PUSH UP PREMIUMS BY ABOUT 20%

03:49.867 --> 03:52.500
IN 2018 AND ACTUALLY ADD

03:52.500 --> 03:54.166
$200 BILLION TO THE DEFICIT

03:54.166 --> 03:56.433
OVER TEN YEARS.

03:56.433 --> 03:57.367
>> John: YES, TRUMP'S PLAN IS

03:57.367 --> 03:58.300
GOING TO MAKE INSURANCE MORE

03:58.300 --> 04:00.433
EXPENSIVE AND LOSE THE FEDERAL

04:00.433 --> 04:02.166
GOVERNMENT MORE MONEY.

04:02.166 --> 04:02.934
IT'S A STRATEGY YOU CAN READ

04:02.934 --> 04:04.367
ABOUT IN HIS BOOK:

04:04.367 --> 04:06.000
"THE ART OF BEING BAD AT STUFF,"

04:06.000 --> 04:07.200
PARENTHESES "INCLUDING BOOK

04:07.200 --> 04:11.133
TITLING," NO END PARENTHESES.

04:11.133 --> 04:12.633
AND EVEN MEMBERS OF HIS OWN

04:12.633 --> 04:14.200
PARTY KNOW THIS IS BAD POLITICS.

04:14.200 --> 04:15.266
WHEN HE'S RAISED THE PROSPECT

04:15.266 --> 04:16.166
OF CUTTING OFF THESE SUBSIDIES

04:16.166 --> 04:17.266
IN THE PAST, SOME HAVE MANAGED

04:17.266 --> 04:18.333
TO TALK HIM OUT OF IT.

04:18.333 --> 04:19.700
THE PROBLEM IS, REPUBLICANS

04:19.700 --> 04:21.667
ARE PLAYING CHECKERS.

04:21.667 --> 04:23.433
AND TRUMP IS PLAYING CHEX.

04:23.433 --> 04:24.567
THAT'S RIGHT.

04:24.567 --> 04:26.133
CHEX, THE GAME OF STRESS-EATING

04:26.133 --> 04:28.266
CHEX MIX BECAUSE YOU DO NOT

04:28.266 --> 04:31.767
UNDERSTAND YOUR JOB.

04:31.767 --> 04:33.633
BECAUSE THAT WAS NOT THE ONLY

04:33.633 --> 04:34.734
CASE THIS WEEK WHERE TRUMP ACTED

04:34.734 --> 04:35.800
WITHOUT SEEMING TO FULLY

04:35.800 --> 04:38.133
UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES.

04:38.133 --> 04:38.967
>> IT IS OFFICIAL.

04:38.967 --> 04:40.100
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAS SAID

04:40.100 --> 04:41.633
THAT HE WILL NO LONGER CERTIFY

04:41.633 --> 04:42.767
THAT IRAN IS COMPLYING WITH

04:42.767 --> 04:44.700
THE NUCLEAR DEAL OR THAT IT IS

04:44.700 --> 04:46.033
IN THE UNITED STATES'

04:46.033 --> 04:47.700
NATIONAL INTEREST.

04:47.700 --> 04:48.734
THIS GOES AGAINST WHAT HIS OWN

04:48.734 --> 04:49.867
NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM AND ALL

04:49.867 --> 04:51.934
THE ALLIES AND GLOBAL POWERS

04:51.934 --> 04:53.066
THAT SIGNED THE DEAL ACTUALLY

04:53.066 --> 04:54.600
BELIEVE.

04:54.600 --> 04:55.734
>> John: EXACTLY, DONALD TRUMP

04:55.734 --> 04:56.633
SEEMS TO BE PRETTY MUCH ALONE

04:56.633 --> 04:58.033
ON THIS.

04:58.033 --> 04:58.834
HIS DEFENSE SECRETARY THINKS

04:58.834 --> 05:00.800
IRAN'S IN COMPLIANCE, AS DOES

05:00.800 --> 05:02.266
HIS SECRETARY OF STATE,

05:02.266 --> 05:03.333
AND I'M PRETTY SURE THAT

05:03.333 --> 05:04.266
MNUCHIN DOES AS WELL, BUT I'M

05:04.266 --> 05:05.834
SO BLINDED BY THAT GUY'S

05:05.834 --> 05:07.400
MOVIE-STAR HANDSOMENESS

05:07.400 --> 05:08.400
THAT I CAN NO LONGER

05:08.400 --> 05:09.834
HEAR ANYTHING HE SAYS.

05:09.834 --> 05:11.700
PRIME BEEF, RIGHT?

05:11.700 --> 05:12.367
PRIME.

05:12.367 --> 05:12.900
BEEF.

05:12.900 --> 05:13.667
RIGHT?

05:13.667 --> 05:15.000
AM I RIGHT?

05:15.000 --> 05:18.800
THE GUY IS HOT.

05:18.800 --> 05:19.900
[APPLAUSE]

05:19.900 --> 05:20.867
YOU DON'T MEAN IT.

05:20.867 --> 05:21.633
NOW, THANKFULLY, TRUMP'S MOVE

05:21.633 --> 05:22.133
DOES NOT INSTANTLY KILL

05:22.133 --> 05:22.934
THE DEAL.

05:22.934 --> 05:24.100
IT'S A LITTLE COMPLICATED, BUT

05:24.100 --> 05:25.300
BASICALLY, CONGRESS PASSED A LAW

05:25.300 --> 05:26.100
WHERE THE PRESIDENT HAS TO

05:26.100 --> 05:26.734
RE-CERTIFY THE DEAL

05:26.734 --> 05:28.367
EVERY 90 DAYS.

05:28.367 --> 05:29.767
NO OTHER NATION HAS

05:29.767 --> 05:31.100
A REQUIREMENT LIKE THIS,

05:31.100 --> 05:33.900
BECAUSE IT'S STUPID.

05:33.900 --> 05:35.066
AND NOW IT GOES TO CONGRESS,

05:35.066 --> 05:36.967
WHOSE OPTIONS RANGE FROM DOING

05:36.967 --> 05:38.934
NOTHING TO RESTORING SANCTIONS,

05:38.934 --> 05:39.700
WHICH COULD BLOW THE WHOLE THING

05:39.700 --> 05:44.100
UP.

05:44.100 --> 05:44.900
THAT WOULD BE INSANE,

05:44.900 --> 05:45.867
BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY EVERYONE --

05:45.867 --> 05:46.467
INCLUDING THE AGENCY WHOSE JOB

05:46.467 --> 05:47.300
IT IS TO MONITOR THIS -- AGREES

05:47.300 --> 05:51.333
THAT IRAN IS IN COMPLIANCE.

05:51.333 --> 05:52.166
SO WHY IS TRUMP DOING IT?

05:52.166 --> 05:52.934
WELL, ON WEDNESDAY HE EXPLAINED

05:52.934 --> 05:53.900
HIS -- WHAT WE'LL CALL

05:53.900 --> 05:55.633
"THINKING."

05:55.633 --> 05:57.000
>> I THINK IT WAS ONE OF THE

05:57.000 --> 05:58.066
MOST INCOMPETENTLY DRAWN DEALS

05:58.066 --> 05:59.667
I'VE EVER SEEN.

05:59.667 --> 06:01.433
$150 BILLION GIVEN.

06:01.433 --> 06:02.200
WE GOT NOTHING.

06:02.200 --> 06:03.400
WE GOT NOTHING.

06:03.400 --> 06:04.533
THEY GOT A PATH TO NUCLEAR

06:04.533 --> 06:05.834
WEAPONS VERY QUICKLY.

06:05.834 --> 06:07.800
AND THINK OF THIS ONE.

06:07.800 --> 06:11.633
$1.7 BILLION IN CASH.

06:11.633 --> 06:13.367
THIS IS CASH OUT OF YOUR POCKET.

06:13.367 --> 06:14.800
WHAT -- YOU KNOW HOW MANY

06:14.800 --> 06:16.400
AIRPLANE LOADS THAT MUST BE?

06:16.400 --> 06:18.300
>> John: OKAY, FOR A START,

06:18.300 --> 06:19.567
STOPPING IRAN GETTING A NUCLEAR

06:19.567 --> 06:21.467
WEAPON IS NOT "GETTING NOTHING."

06:21.467 --> 06:22.633
IT LITERALLY MAKES LIFE ON EARTH

06:22.633 --> 06:24.233
SAFER.

06:24.233 --> 06:24.867
AS FOR THE MONEY, WE DIDN'T GIVE

06:24.867 --> 06:26.166
IT TO THEM.

06:26.166 --> 06:26.867
ALL OF IT WAS THEIRS TO BEGIN

06:26.867 --> 06:27.533
WITH.

06:27.533 --> 06:28.767
IT WAS JUST FROZEN UNDER

06:28.767 --> 06:30.033
SANCTIONS WE'VE NOW LIFTED OR,

06:30.033 --> 06:31.500
IN THE CASE OF THAT PLANELOAD OF

06:31.500 --> 06:33.867
CASH, IT WAS MONEY THEY PAID US

06:33.867 --> 06:36.633
FOR MILITARY EQUIPMENT IN 1979,

06:36.633 --> 06:37.200
THAT WE NEVER DELIVERED.

06:37.200 --> 06:37.934
SO HE'S WRONG.

06:37.934 --> 06:39.300
HE'S JUST WRONG.

06:39.300 --> 06:41.533
HE JUST SAID A STRING OF THINGS

06:41.533 --> 06:44.166
THAT WERE FACTUALLY INACCURATE.

06:44.166 --> 06:46.834
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS?

06:46.834 --> 06:48.333
OH, YES, WE GOT HIM!

06:48.333 --> 06:51.800
WE GOT HIM!

06:51.800 --> 06:52.433
YES!

06:52.433 --> 06:52.934
WAIT!

06:52.934 --> 06:54.033
WAIT!

06:54.033 --> 06:54.367
STOP!

06:54.367 --> 06:57.934
STOP!

06:57.934 --> 06:58.734
WE DIDN'T GET HIM.

06:58.734 --> 06:59.633
I JUST GOT A NEWS ALERT.

06:59.633 --> 07:01.467
HE'S STILL THE PRESIDENT.

07:01.467 --> 07:02.800
HE'S STILL THE PRESIDENT.

07:02.800 --> 07:03.834
WE DIDN'T GET HIM.

07:03.834 --> 07:04.367
YEAH, IT TURNS OUT

07:04.367 --> 07:06.433
NOTHING MATTERS.

07:06.433 --> 07:11.000
I'M SORRY.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.300
HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HE WAS

07:13.300 --> 07:14.700
TALKING ABOUT.

07:14.700 --> 07:15.734
SO, AS I WAS SAYING, THE IRAN

07:15.734 --> 07:16.734
DEAL NOW GOES TO CONGRESS.

07:16.734 --> 07:17.800
BUT THEY CAN'T RENEGOTIATE IT,

07:17.800 --> 07:18.934
BECAUSE THE DEAL ISN'T JUST

07:18.934 --> 07:20.200
BETWEEN THE U.S. AND IRAN.

07:20.200 --> 07:21.467
IT'S BETWEEN

07:21.467 --> 07:23.100
ALL OF THESE PARTIES,

07:23.100 --> 07:24.033
AND THEY'VE ALL BEEN PRETTY

07:24.033 --> 07:24.800
CLEAR WHERE THEY STAND.

07:24.800 --> 07:25.900
>> E.U. LEADERS ARE DEFENDING

07:25.900 --> 07:27.533
THE CURRENT AGREEMENT AND THE

07:27.533 --> 07:29.667
U.K., GERMANY AND FRANCE SAY

07:29.667 --> 07:30.767
THAT THEY ARE COMMITTED

07:30.767 --> 07:32.500
TO THE DEAL AS IS.

07:32.500 --> 07:33.467
>> John: YEAH, OF COURSE THEY

07:33.467 --> 07:35.000
DON'T WANT TO REOPEN THE DEAL.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.767
THAT'S NOT HOW DEALS WORK.

07:36.767 --> 07:38.500
IF YOU BUY A LAMP ON CRAIGSLIST

07:38.500 --> 07:40.734
FOR $40, THEN THE DEAL IS ONE

07:40.734 --> 07:42.333
PERSON GETS $40, ONE PERSON

07:42.333 --> 07:44.367
GETS A LAMP.

07:44.367 --> 07:45.567
ALSO, ONE OF YOU WILL GET

07:45.567 --> 07:47.166
MURDERED, BUT FIGURING OUT

07:47.166 --> 07:49.834
WHO GETS MURDERED AND HOW IS THE

07:49.834 --> 07:52.433
JOIE DE VIVRE OF CRAIGSLIST.

07:52.433 --> 07:53.533
AND AS IRAN'S FOREIGN MINISTER

07:53.533 --> 07:54.533
POINTS OUT, THIS DECISION MAY

07:54.533 --> 07:55.367
SEVERELY LIMIT THE ABILITY OF

07:55.367 --> 07:56.934
TRUMP, OR INDEED ANY FUTURE

07:56.934 --> 07:58.567
PRESIDENTS, TO MAKE DEALS

07:58.567 --> 08:00.166
FROM NOW ON.

08:00.166 --> 08:03.867
>> NOBODY ELSE WILL TRUST ANY

08:03.867 --> 08:07.100
U.S. ADMINISTRATION TO ENGAGE

08:07.100 --> 08:09.967
IN ANY LONG-TERM NEGOTIATION,

08:09.967 --> 08:11.400
BECAUSE THE LENGTH OF ANY

08:11.400 --> 08:14.033
COMMITMENT, THE DURATION OF ANY

08:14.033 --> 08:16.433
COMMITMENT FROM NOW ON WITH ANY

08:16.433 --> 08:17.467
U.S. ADMINISTRATION WILL BE THE

08:17.467 --> 08:18.667
REMAINDER OF THE TERM

08:18.667 --> 08:20.367
OF THAT PRESIDENT.

08:20.367 --> 08:21.433
>> John: AND THAT IS A HUGE

08:21.433 --> 08:23.166
PROBLEM.

08:23.166 --> 08:24.433
COUNTRIES NEED TO KNOW AMERICA

08:24.433 --> 08:31.333
WILL HONOR ITS AGREEMENTS

08:31.333 --> 08:32.767
IF THEY DON'T, IT'S GOING TO BE

08:32.767 --> 08:36.767
AN ISSUE NO MATTER THE NEXT

08:36.767 --> 08:37.867
PRESIDENT.

08:37.867 --> 08:40.300
NO MATTER WHO THAT PERSON IS,

08:40.300 --> 08:41.000
WHETHER IT'S PRESIDENT WARREN

08:41.000 --> 08:41.533
OR PRESIDENT KAINE OR --

08:41.533 --> 08:42.000
MORE LIKELY,

08:42.000 --> 08:42.467
PRESIDENT DONALD, JR.,

08:42.467 --> 08:43.033
FOLLOWED BY PRESIDENT ERIC,

08:43.033 --> 08:43.600
FOLLOWED BY PRESIDENT JARED

08:43.600 --> 08:46.600
AND IVANKA.

08:46.600 --> 08:47.567
THERE'S NO REASON TO EXPECT THAT

08:47.567 --> 08:50.333
WON'T HAPPEN.

08:50.333 --> 08:50.900
SO, THIS IRAN-DEAL DECISION

08:50.900 --> 08:51.400
IS EQUAL PARTS DANGEROUS

08:51.400 --> 08:52.100
AND BIZARRE.

08:52.100 --> 08:52.734
TRUMP IS ASKING CONGRESS TO FIX

08:52.734 --> 08:53.367
A DEAL THEY DON'T REALISTICALLY

08:53.367 --> 08:54.133
HAVE THE ABILITY TO FIX.

08:54.133 --> 08:54.734
FIXES, INCIDENTALLY, THAT MAY

08:54.734 --> 08:55.934
VIOLATE THE DEAL, WHICH ALREADY

08:55.934 --> 08:56.734
HAS A PROCESS FOR RESTORING

08:56.734 --> 08:57.767
SANCTIONS IF IRAN

08:57.767 --> 08:58.567
DOESN'T COMPLY, WHICH,

08:58.567 --> 09:01.633
REMEMBER, EVERYONE AGREES

09:01.633 --> 09:02.567
THAT THEY ARE.

09:02.567 --> 09:03.300
AND HE ALSO THREATENED TO

09:03.300 --> 09:04.533
PULL OUT OF THE DEAL HIMSELF,

09:04.533 --> 09:05.467
EVEN THOUGH HIS SECRETARY

09:05.467 --> 09:06.500
OF STATE HAD ALREADY SAID

09:06.500 --> 09:07.900
HE WOULDN'T, BUT WHO KNOWS IF

09:07.900 --> 09:09.166
THOSE TWO ARE EVEN SPEAKING,

09:09.166 --> 09:10.667
CONSIDERING TILLERSON APPARENTLY

09:10.667 --> 09:12.600
CALLED TRUMP A "FUCKING MORON,"

09:12.600 --> 09:13.800
AND TRUMP PUBLICLY CHALLENGED

09:13.800 --> 09:15.333
HIM TO AN I.Q. CONTEST

09:15.333 --> 09:19.000
THIS WEEK.

09:19.000 --> 09:19.967
LOOK, AS FOREIGN POLICIES GO,

09:19.967 --> 09:21.333
THIS IS INCOHERENT.

09:21.333 --> 09:22.767
YOU CAN'T CALL IT REALISM

09:22.767 --> 09:24.867
OR IDEALISM OR NEOLIBERALISM.

09:24.867 --> 09:26.033
YOU CAN BARELY CALL IT FOREIGN

09:26.033 --> 09:28.066
POLICY.

09:28.066 --> 09:29.767
THE THING IT'S CLOSEST TO IS

09:29.767 --> 09:31.500
A SCARED MONKEY IN A SUBMARINE

09:31.500 --> 09:33.533
RANDOMLY PUSHING BUTTONS.

09:33.533 --> 09:36.700
AND SURE, THAT MIGHT BE FUN

09:36.700 --> 09:37.734
TO WATCH UNTIL IT HITS YOU,

09:37.734 --> 09:39.600
"OH SHIT, WE'RE ALL ON THE

09:39.600 --> 09:42.333
SUBMARINE WITH THE MONKEY."

09:42.333 --> 09:46.967
AND NOW THIS.

09:46.967 --> 09:50.467
>> Announcer: AND NOW IT'S

09:50.467 --> 09:53.200
AUTUMN AND THAT MEANS ONLY ONE

09:53.200 --> 09:53.500
THING.

09:53.500 --> 09:56.367
>> OH, BOY.

09:56.367 --> 09:57.934
PUMPKIN SPICE LATTE.

09:57.934 --> 10:01.233
>> A WHOLE SEASON IN A CUP OF

10:01.233 --> 10:02.033
COFFEE.

10:02.033 --> 10:05.734
>> YEAH, PUMPKIN SPICE LATTE.

10:05.734 --> 10:07.867
>> IT'S OFFICIALLY PUMPKIN SPICE

10:07.867 --> 10:08.066
LATTE.

10:08.066 --> 10:09.934
>> IN SUMMER, YOU CAN'T GET IT.

10:09.934 --> 10:12.633
>> NO, YOU CAN'T.

10:12.633 --> 10:14.400
>> THE PUMPKIN SPICE LATTE.

10:14.400 --> 10:17.633
THAT SENT ME TO THE MOON.

10:17.633 --> 10:21.200
>> I AM WAITING FOR THE PUMPKIN

10:21.200 --> 10:22.433
LATTE AND TRYING TO LOSE WEIGHT

10:22.433 --> 10:25.967
SO I HAD TO STAY AWAY FROM IT.

10:25.967 --> 10:29.000
THE PUMPKIN LATTE.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.266
>> PUMPKIN SPICE LATTE!

10:31.266 --> 10:34.533
>> FORGET ABOUT THE LEAVES.

10:34.533 --> 10:36.066
AS SOON STARBUCKS HAS THAT

10:36.066 --> 10:38.233
PUMPKIN SPICE LATTE.

10:38.233 --> 10:41.233
>> AND THEY TAKE AWAY THE

10:41.233 --> 10:44.767
PUMPKIN SPICE LATTE, I CRY A

10:44.767 --> 10:48.066
>> DON'T CRY, HANDSOME ACTOR

10:48.066 --> 10:49.200
MAN.

10:49.200 --> 10:50.633
>> PUMPKIN SPICE LATTES ARE

10:50.633 --> 10:50.900
DELICIOUS.

10:50.900 --> 10:54.567
THEY SEEM WHOLESOME AND THEY ARE

10:54.567 --> 10:56.333
ONLY A AVERAGE.

10:56.333 --> 10:59.000
BUT ARE THEY RACIST?

10:59.000 --> 11:03.400
>> LOVE YOUR PUMPKIN SPICE LATTE

11:03.400 --> 11:03.734
COAT TYPE.

11:03.734 --> 11:06.667
>> I DIDN'T WANT TO GO PUMPKIN

11:06.667 --> 11:06.900
SPICE --

11:06.900 --> 11:11.900
>> IS IT X-RATED?

11:11.900 --> 11:12.967
>> WAIT.

11:12.967 --> 11:16.033
>> THE BIGGER DEAL IS THIS MAPLE

11:16.033 --> 11:16.533
PECAN LATTE.

11:16.533 --> 11:18.333
IT'S GOING TO PUSH THE PUMPKIN

11:18.333 --> 11:20.700
SPICE TO THE SIDE.

11:20.700 --> 11:25.100
>> FUCK MAPLE PECAN.

11:25.100 --> 11:28.333
PUMPKIN SPICE LATTES FOREVER!

11:28.333 --> 11:29.133
>> John: MOVING ON.

11:29.133 --> 11:30.400
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

11:30.400 --> 11:31.033
EQUIFAX, THE COMPANY WHOSE NAME

11:31.033 --> 11:31.967
SOUNDS LIKE A THEATRICAL

11:31.967 --> 11:33.133
PRODUCTION IN WHICH DANIEL

11:33.133 --> 11:33.900
RADCLIFFE PLAYS A HORSE THAT

11:33.900 --> 11:36.433
FUCKS A FAX MACHINE.

11:36.433 --> 11:37.667
EQUIFAX IS ONE OF THE

11:37.667 --> 11:38.700
BIG THREE CREDIT REPORTING

11:38.700 --> 11:40.033
AGENCIES, THE COMPANIES

11:40.033 --> 11:42.333
WHO KEEP FINANCIAL DATA ON ALL

11:42.333 --> 11:44.333
OF US, SO PEOPLE LIKE LENDERS

11:44.333 --> 11:46.100
AND LANDLORDS CAN DECIDE WHETHER

11:46.100 --> 11:46.967
OR NOT WE'RE TRUSTWORTHY.

11:46.967 --> 11:48.266
SO EQUIFAX CONTROLS SOME OF OUR

11:48.266 --> 11:49.567
MOST SENSITIVE INFORMATION,

11:49.567 --> 11:51.233
AND ABOUT A MONTH AGO,

11:51.233 --> 11:52.800
WE LEARNED THIS.

11:52.800 --> 11:54.300
>> BREAKING NEWS FROM THE CREDIT

11:54.300 --> 11:56.600
MONITORING COMPANY EQUIFAX.

11:56.600 --> 11:57.800
CYBER THIEVES MAKING OFF

11:57.800 --> 12:00.433
WITH PRIVATE INFORMATION OF 143

12:00.433 --> 12:01.734
MILLION AMERICANS, NEARLY HALF

12:01.734 --> 12:07.934
THE U.S. POPULATION.

12:07.934 --> 12:08.934
>> John: IT'S ACTUALLY WORSE.

12:08.934 --> 12:10.000
IT'S NOW ACTUALLY 145 MILLION.

12:10.000 --> 12:10.467
AND I'VE GOT GOOD NEWS

12:10.467 --> 12:10.934
AND BAD NEWS.

12:10.934 --> 12:13.066
THE GOOD NEWS IS BY PRIVATE

12:13.066 --> 12:13.700
INFORMATION,

12:13.700 --> 12:14.400
THEY DON'T MEAN YOUR GOOGLE

12:14.400 --> 12:16.200
SEARCH HISTORY.

12:16.200 --> 12:17.900
SO NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT THE TIME

12:17.900 --> 12:18.633
YOU SEARCHED FOR "WARIO PORN

12:18.633 --> 12:20.400
PARENTHESES REAL,"

12:20.400 --> 12:21.500
OR "WORLD'S RICHEST DOGS

12:21.500 --> 12:23.667
LOOKING FOR ASSISTANTS,"

12:23.667 --> 12:24.900
OR "CAN LONELINESS CAUSE

12:24.900 --> 12:27.533
THE FARTS?"

12:27.533 --> 12:29.834
THE BAD NEWS IS, THE INFORMATION

12:29.834 --> 12:31.767
THEY GOT COULD WELL BE ALL THIS.

12:31.767 --> 12:33.433
>> IT'S YOUR NAME, SOCIAL

12:33.433 --> 12:35.333
SECURITY NUMBER, BIRTH DATE,

12:35.333 --> 12:37.100
DRIVER'S LICENSE, AND ADDRESSES

12:37.100 --> 12:39.000
WHERE YOU LIVED, INFORMATION

12:39.000 --> 12:40.500
THAT IS MOSTLY PERMANENT,

12:40.500 --> 12:41.333
UNLESS YOU'RE IN FEDERAL WITNESS

12:41.333 --> 12:44.867
PROTECTION.

12:44.867 --> 12:47.367
>> John: WOW, OKAY, THAT SOUNDS

12:47.367 --> 12:48.166
BAD, BUT HERE'S A SIMPLE

12:48.166 --> 12:48.667
SOLUTION:

12:48.667 --> 12:49.367
JUST MOVE 145 MILLION PEOPLE

12:49.367 --> 12:50.300
INTO THE WITNESS PROTECTION

12:50.300 --> 12:51.233
PROGRAM.

12:51.233 --> 12:52.266
THAT MEANS JONESES?

12:52.266 --> 12:53.066
YOU'RE THE THOMPSONS.

12:53.066 --> 12:54.000
THOMPSONS?

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
YOU'RE THE CAMPBELLS.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
CAMPBELLS, YOU'RE THE MENDOZAS.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.033
MENDOZAS, YOU'RE THE JONESES.

12:59.033 --> 12:59.767
WAIT, HOLD ON.

12:59.767 --> 13:00.867
JONESES, YOU SHOULDN'T BE THERE.

13:00.867 --> 13:01.734
I MADE YOU THE THOMPSONS!

13:01.734 --> 13:02.600
NO, THOMPSONS!

13:02.600 --> 13:04.066
I MADE YOU THE CAMPBELLS!

13:04.066 --> 13:05.967
CAMPBELLS, YOU'RE THE MENDOZAS!

13:05.967 --> 13:07.533
MENDOZAS, WHY ARE YOU HERE?

13:07.533 --> 13:08.433
YOU SHOULD BE LIVING IN

13:08.433 --> 13:09.667
THE JONESES' HOUSE IN PHOENIX!

13:09.667 --> 13:10.266
OH, NO, I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID

13:10.266 --> 13:11.734
PHOENIX!

13:11.734 --> 13:15.066
OH, GOD, THE JONESES ARE DEAD!

13:15.066 --> 13:15.934
THE JONESES ARE DEAD!

13:15.934 --> 13:17.233
FORGET THE WHOLE PLAN!

13:17.233 --> 13:21.266
I WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP!

13:21.266 --> 13:23.667
I'M SORRY FOR TRYING.

13:23.667 --> 13:27.033
OH, THEY ARE DEAD!

13:27.033 --> 13:28.033
AND I KNOW THERE MIGHT BE

13:28.033 --> 13:28.934
YOUNGER PEOPLE WATCHING THIS

13:28.934 --> 13:30.433
SAYING, "WELL, WHO CARES?

13:30.433 --> 13:31.567
WE'RE THE FIRST GENERATION

13:31.567 --> 13:32.400
TO ROUTINELY SEND PICTURES OF

13:32.400 --> 13:33.533
OUR JUNK TO EACH OTHER OVER

13:33.533 --> 13:35.000
THE INTERNET.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.033
WHY SHOULD WE GIVE A SHIT

13:36.033 --> 13:36.700
ABOUT SOMEONE SEEING OUR

13:36.700 --> 13:38.300
SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS?"

13:38.300 --> 13:39.700
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW CRIMINALS

13:39.700 --> 13:41.433
CAN DO A LOT MORE WITH THAT

13:41.433 --> 13:42.433
NUMBER THAN THEY CAN

13:42.433 --> 13:44.367
WITH A PICTURE OF YOUR DICK.

13:44.367 --> 13:45.633
>> THIS INFORMATION'S GONNA BE

13:45.633 --> 13:46.467
SOLD LEFT AND RIGHT ON THE BLACK

13:46.467 --> 13:47.333
MARKET.

13:47.333 --> 13:48.667
PEOPLE ARE GONNA BE ABLE TO OPEN

13:48.667 --> 13:50.633
UP CREDIT CARDS FOR THE REST OF

13:50.633 --> 13:53.800
YOUR LIFE ONCE THEY HAVE THAT

13:53.800 --> 13:54.100
INFORMATION.

13:54.100 --> 13:54.734
>> THEY CAN GO OUT AND PURCHASE

13:54.734 --> 13:56.066
A HOME IN YOUR NAME.

13:56.066 --> 13:57.166
THEY CAN OPEN BANK ACCOUNTS,

13:57.166 --> 13:58.333
TAKE CAR LOANS.

13:58.333 --> 13:59.233
>> SOMEONE WHO HAS YOUR SOCIAL

13:59.233 --> 14:00.200
SECURITY NUMBER COULD ACTUALLY

14:00.200 --> 14:01.367
TAKE A JOB, THEY COULD FILE

14:01.367 --> 14:03.233
TAXES, AND EVEN CLAIM YOUR KIDS

14:03.233 --> 14:05.000
AS DEPENDENTS AND BE GONE WITH

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
YOUR REFUND BEFORE YOU EVER

14:06.000 --> 14:11.467
ACTUALLY FILE A TAX RETURN.

14:11.467 --> 14:12.700
>> John: NO, NO!

14:12.700 --> 14:13.367
THE TAX BENEFIT IS THE WHOLE

14:13.367 --> 14:14.333
POINT OF HAVING CHILDREN!

14:14.333 --> 14:15.266
WITHOUT THAT, ALL YOU'RE LEFT

14:15.266 --> 14:16.834
WITH IS YOUR ACTUAL CHILDREN,

14:16.834 --> 14:17.800
WHICH, YOU KNOW...

14:17.800 --> 14:19.500
UGH.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.333
THE POINT IS,

14:21.333 --> 14:22.667
THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM.

14:22.667 --> 14:23.867
AND IN ANY OTHER ERA, THIS

14:23.867 --> 14:24.800
WOULD'VE BEEN THE BIGGEST NEWS

14:24.800 --> 14:27.367
STORY FOR A MONTH, BUT NOW THAT

14:27.367 --> 14:28.500
EVERY DAY'S HEADLINE IS SIMPLY

14:28.500 --> 14:30.300
THE WORDS "EVERYTHING BATSHIT

14:30.300 --> 14:31.900
BANANAS AGAIN TODAY,"

14:31.900 --> 14:34.567
IT'S SLIPPED UNDER THE RADAR.

14:34.567 --> 14:35.467
IT IS WORTH ASKING

14:35.467 --> 14:36.834
HOW THE HELL DID THIS HAPPEN?

14:36.834 --> 14:38.033
THE SHORT ANSWER IS,

14:38.033 --> 14:39.066
"THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE HAVE DONE

14:39.066 --> 14:41.333
LITERALLY EVERYTHING WRONG."

14:41.333 --> 14:41.967
AND LET'S START WITH JUST

14:41.967 --> 14:42.567
THE WAY EQUIFAX TOLD US

14:42.567 --> 14:43.867
ABOUT THE HACK.

14:43.867 --> 14:45.633
IN EARLY SEPTEMBER,

14:45.633 --> 14:49.400
THEIR THEN CEO RICK SMITH,

14:49.400 --> 14:50.667
A MAN SO BLAND HE MAY AS WELL BE

14:50.667 --> 14:52.033
CALLED "HUMAN PERSON"

14:52.033 --> 14:54.533
OR "FRASIER RERUN," ISSUED

14:54.533 --> 14:56.266
A TAPED APOLOGY, BUT HIS REMORSE

14:56.266 --> 14:57.000
SEEMED A LITTLE LESS THAN

14:57.000 --> 14:58.500
HEARTFELT.

14:58.500 --> 14:59.734
>> ON JULY 29TH OF THIS YEAR,

14:59.734 --> 15:01.567
WE DISCOVERED THAT ATTACKERS HAD

15:01.567 --> 15:03.233
GAINED UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS

15:03.233 --> 15:05.867
TO CERTAIN EQUIFAX DATA FILES.

15:05.867 --> 15:06.900
THIS IS CLEARLY A DISAPPOINTING

15:06.900 --> 15:07.767
EVENT AND ONE THAT STRIKES AT

15:07.767 --> 15:09.734
THE HEART OF WHO WE ARE

15:09.734 --> 15:11.333
AND WHAT WE DO.

15:11.333 --> 15:12.700
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

15:12.700 --> 15:13.767
RICK SMITH IS SO ALARMINGLY

15:13.767 --> 15:15.166
MECHANICAL, YOU PROBABLY HAVE

15:15.166 --> 15:16.000
TO PUT HIM IN RICE EVERY TIME

15:16.000 --> 15:18.767
HE GETS WET.

15:18.767 --> 15:20.133
NOW, NOTABLY, HE MENTIONED THERE

15:20.133 --> 15:21.567
THAT EQUIFAX LEARNED ABOUT

15:21.567 --> 15:23.367
THE BREACH ON JULY 29TH.

15:23.367 --> 15:24.600
BUT EVEN MORE NOTABLY,

15:24.600 --> 15:26.166
THAT VIDEO WAS UPLOADED IN

15:26.166 --> 15:28.500
SEPTEMBER, WHICH IS, AND THIS IS

15:28.500 --> 15:31.200
TRUE, AFTER JULY.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.834
SO EQUIFAX KNEW ABOUT THE BREACH

15:32.834 --> 15:33.867
FOR NEARLY SIX WEEKS BEFORE

15:33.867 --> 15:35.100
TELLING THE PUBLIC.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.000
AND THEY CLAIM THEY NEEDED THAT

15:37.000 --> 15:37.900
TIME BECAUSE THEIR INVESTIGATION

15:37.900 --> 15:38.367
WAS "COMPLEX

15:38.367 --> 15:40.667
AND TIME-CONSUMING."

15:40.667 --> 15:42.166
ALTHOUGH THAT'S NOT ALL THAT

15:42.166 --> 15:43.834
HAPPENED IN THAT TIME SPAN.

15:43.834 --> 15:45.934
>> THREE EQUIFAX EXECUTIVES SOLD

15:45.934 --> 15:47.333
NEARLY $2 MILLION IN COMPANY

15:47.333 --> 15:49.467
STOCK DAYS AFTER THE DATA BREACH

15:49.467 --> 15:51.300
WAS DISCOVERED.

15:51.300 --> 15:52.700
>> John: WOW, SELLING STOCK

15:52.700 --> 15:54.667
BEFORE THE PUBLIC KNOWS THERE'S

15:54.667 --> 15:55.667
A PROBLEM IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS

15:55.667 --> 15:56.834
THAT LOOKS SUSPICIOUS, WHETHER

15:56.834 --> 15:57.800
OR NOT YOU'RE ACTUALLY DOING

15:57.800 --> 15:59.834
SOMETHING WRONG, LIKE WALKING

15:59.834 --> 16:00.867
INTO A PETTING ZOO

16:00.867 --> 16:02.900
WITH A BIB ON.

16:02.900 --> 16:04.867
WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU PLANNING

16:04.867 --> 16:07.767
ON MESSILY DEVOURING?

16:07.767 --> 16:09.033
AND EQUIFAX DEFENDED THAT,

16:09.033 --> 16:09.900
SAYING, NONE OF THE EXECUTIVES

16:09.900 --> 16:11.133
IN QUESTION, INCLUDING THEIR

16:11.133 --> 16:12.500
CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER,

16:12.500 --> 16:13.900
KNEW ABOUT THE DATA BREACH.

16:13.900 --> 16:15.400
WHICH RAISES ANOTHER QUESTION,

16:15.400 --> 16:21.834
HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?

16:21.834 --> 16:22.500
DID THEY JUST IGNORE EMAILS

16:22.500 --> 16:27.233
WITH THE SUBJECT LINE,

16:27.233 --> 16:33.700
DATA.

16:33.700 --> 16:35.300
YOU STARED BLANKLY AT ME AND

16:35.300 --> 16:36.300
SAID I'M GOING TO ORDER FROM THE

16:36.300 --> 16:38.433
SALAD PLACE."

16:38.433 --> 16:39.233
AND IF YOU'RE GETTING FRUSTRATED

16:39.233 --> 16:41.100
WITH THAT KIND OF INCOMPETENCE,

16:41.100 --> 16:41.800
PACE YOURSELF, BECAUSE THIS

16:41.800 --> 16:42.600
STORY GETS A LOT WORSE.

16:42.600 --> 16:43.300
APPARENTLY, THERE WERE MULTIPLE

16:43.300 --> 16:43.934
POINTS WHERE THIS HACK COULD'VE

16:43.934 --> 16:44.800
BEEN PREVENTED.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.166
AND ONE OF THEM IS INCREDIBLE,

16:46.166 --> 16:47.667
BECAUSE EQUIFAX WERE ALERTED BY

16:47.667 --> 16:49.300
HOMELAND SECURITY BACK IN MARCH

16:49.300 --> 16:49.834
THAT THEY NEEDED TO FIX

16:49.834 --> 16:51.166
A CRITICAL VULNERABILITY

16:51.166 --> 16:52.266
IN THEIR SOFTWARE.

16:52.266 --> 16:53.300
BUT AS LAWMAKERS DISCOVERED

16:53.300 --> 16:54.934
AT A RECENT HEARING, THAT'S NOT

16:54.934 --> 16:56.400
WHAT HAPPENED.

16:56.400 --> 16:57.667
>> THERE WAS ONE PERSON,

16:57.667 --> 16:59.533
APPARENTLY, WHO FORGOT TO TELL

16:59.533 --> 17:01.266
SOMEBODY THAT THEY HAD A PIECE

17:01.266 --> 17:02.533
OF SOFTWARE THAT NEEDED TO BE

17:02.533 --> 17:04.600
PATCHED.

17:04.600 --> 17:06.000
>> John: YEAH, IT'S NOT IDEAL

17:06.000 --> 17:06.734
THAT A COMPANY GUARDING SUCH

17:06.734 --> 17:07.967
VALUABLE INFORMATION LEAVES

17:07.967 --> 17:08.900
SOMETHING THAT IMPORTANT DOWN

17:08.900 --> 17:11.333
TO ONE PERSON.

17:11.333 --> 17:12.667
IT'S LIKE FINDING OUT

17:12.667 --> 17:14.133
CHASE BANK HAS A BIG RED BUTTON

17:14.133 --> 17:16.400
LABELED "LOSE EVERYONE'S MONEY"

17:16.400 --> 17:18.200
AND THE ONLY THING STOPPING

17:18.200 --> 17:20.333
ANYONE FROM PUSHING IT IS FRANK.

17:20.333 --> 17:25.667
AND LOOK, I LOVE FRANK,

17:25.667 --> 17:28.266
I LOVE THE GUY,

17:28.266 --> 17:29.533
BUT WHAT IF HE HAS TO PEE?

17:29.533 --> 17:30.200
AND I'D LOVE TO SAY THIS IS

17:30.200 --> 17:30.867
AN ANOMALY, BUT EQUIFAX HAS HAD

17:30.867 --> 17:31.734
MULTIPLE HEADLINE-GRABBING

17:31.734 --> 17:32.934
BREACHES OVER THE YEARS.

17:32.934 --> 17:33.500
AND THAT'S NOT EVEN COUNTING

17:33.500 --> 17:35.100
SMALLER INCIDENTS LIKE THIS.

17:35.100 --> 17:36.200
>> I CHECKED MY CREDIT REPORT

17:36.200 --> 17:37.033
THE OTHER DAY ONLINE WITH

17:37.033 --> 17:40.033
EQUIFAX.

17:40.033 --> 17:41.166
THAT WAS IT, AND NEXT THING

17:41.166 --> 17:42.834
I KNOW, I HAVE 300 PIECES

17:42.834 --> 17:44.767
OF MAIL SITTING IN MY MAILBOX.

17:44.767 --> 17:46.133
>> EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE

17:46.133 --> 17:47.700
IS ADDRESSED TO HER, BUT THEY'RE

17:47.700 --> 17:49.667
NOT HERS.

17:49.667 --> 17:50.567
INSTEAD, SHE GOT OTHER PEOPLE'S

17:50.567 --> 17:52.266
CREDIT REPORTS.

17:52.266 --> 17:54.133
NOW, NAMES, SOCIAL SECURITY

17:54.133 --> 17:56.367
NUMBERS, DATES OF BIRTH, CURRENT

17:56.367 --> 17:58.900
AND PREVIOUS ADDRESSES, BANK AND

17:58.900 --> 18:00.667
LOAN ACCOUNT NUMBERS ALL STACKED

18:00.667 --> 18:02.967
UP ON A KITCHEN TABLE

18:02.967 --> 18:07.166
IN BIDDEFORD.

18:07.166 --> 18:08.467
>> John: THAT'S NOT GREAT,

18:08.467 --> 18:10.700
AND IT REALLY SHOULD'VE SET OFF

18:10.700 --> 18:13.133
RED FLAGS AT EQUIFAX WHEN

18:13.133 --> 18:13.700
HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT CREDIT

18:13.700 --> 18:16.567
REPORTS WERE

18:16.567 --> 18:17.767
REPORTS WERE BEING MAILED TO THE

18:17.767 --> 18:18.400
SAME ADDRESS.

18:18.400 --> 18:19.233
WHAT DID YOU THINK HAPPENED?

18:19.233 --> 18:20.133
THAT EVERY SINGLE FRAGGLE

18:20.133 --> 18:21.133
CHECKED THEIR CREDIT AT ONCE

18:21.133 --> 18:22.400
DOWN AT FRAGGLE ROCK?

18:22.400 --> 18:27.233
DOWN AT FRAGGLE ROCK?

18:27.233 --> 18:28.100
VERY NICE.

18:28.100 --> 18:28.633
AND I KNOW OTHER COMPANIES

18:28.633 --> 18:29.300
HAVE HAD BREACHES, BUT NONE

18:29.300 --> 18:30.300
REMOTELY AS DAMAGING AS THIS

18:30.300 --> 18:31.533
NEW EQUIFAX ONE.

18:31.533 --> 18:32.767
BECAUSE REMEMBER, THIS ISN'T

18:32.767 --> 18:33.667
TARGET EXPOSING CUSTOMERS'

18:33.667 --> 18:35.333
CREDIT CARDS.

18:35.333 --> 18:36.166
THIS IS COMPROMISING

18:36.166 --> 18:38.667
SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS,

18:38.667 --> 18:39.934
THE THINGS THIEVES COULD USE

18:39.934 --> 18:40.967
TO OPEN NEW CREDIT CARDS

18:40.967 --> 18:41.934
IN YOUR NAME.

18:41.934 --> 18:43.166
AND IF YOUR INFORMATION WAS

18:43.166 --> 18:44.333
STOLEN WHICH, REMEMBER,

18:44.333 --> 18:46.734
IS ABOUT A 50-50 CHANCE

18:46.734 --> 18:48.934
IT COULD HAUNT YOU FOREVER.

18:48.934 --> 18:49.367
>> YOU DON'T CHANGE

18:49.367 --> 18:49.834
YOUR BIRTH DATE.

18:49.834 --> 18:50.467
YOU DON'T CHANGE YOUR SOCIAL

18:50.467 --> 18:52.700
SECURITY NUMBER.

18:52.700 --> 18:54.367
THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN JEOPARDIZED

18:54.367 --> 18:55.433
BY THIS HACK WILL HAVE TO

18:55.433 --> 18:57.700
PROTECT THEMSELVES FOR YEARS

18:57.700 --> 19:01.200
UNTIL THEY'RE DEAD.

19:01.200 --> 19:02.834
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

19:02.834 --> 19:04.066
AND THINK ABOUT IT THERE'S ONLY

19:04.066 --> 19:04.800
ONE OTHER THING THAT YOU HAVE TO

19:04.800 --> 19:05.467
CONSTANTLY PROTECT YOURSELF FROM

19:05.467 --> 19:07.900
UNTIL YOU'RE DEAD.

19:07.900 --> 19:09.600
AND THAT'S FUCKING DEATH.

19:09.600 --> 19:10.600
AND YOU'D HOPE THAT EQUIFAX

19:10.600 --> 19:11.734
WOULD DO A DECENT JOB OF

19:11.734 --> 19:13.867
MITIGATING THE DAMAGE.

19:13.867 --> 19:14.867
AFTER ALL, THEY HAD NEARLY SIX

19:14.867 --> 19:16.667
WEEKS TO WORK ON A RESPONSE.

19:16.667 --> 19:17.667
BUT INSTEAD, THEIR FUCKUPS

19:17.667 --> 19:18.433
CONTINUED.

19:18.433 --> 19:19.433
FOR INSTANCE, THEY CREATED

19:19.433 --> 19:20.467
A WEBSITE FOR CONCERNED

19:20.467 --> 19:22.533
CONSUMERS TO GO TO, BUT THEN

19:22.533 --> 19:23.834
THIS HAPPENED.

19:23.834 --> 19:25.467
>> THE SITE THAT EQUIFAX STARTED

19:25.467 --> 19:28.867
IS CALLED EquifaxSecurity2017

19:28.867 --> 19:30.734
BUT A DEVELOPER NAMED NICK

19:30.734 --> 19:32.500
SWEETING WANTED TO SHOW HOW EASY

19:32.500 --> 19:34.033
IT IS TO CREATE A SIMILAR,

19:34.033 --> 19:35.400
FAKE SITE, SO HE DID.

19:35.400 --> 19:36.734
HE CALLED IT

19:36.734 --> 19:42.433
SecurityEquifax2017.

19:42.433 --> 19:43.533
>> John: EXACTLY, SOMEONE

19:43.533 --> 19:44.367
CREATED A FAKE SITE.

19:44.367 --> 19:44.867
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING,

19:44.867 --> 19:45.333
"WHO'D BE DUMB ENOUGH

19:45.333 --> 19:45.967
TO FALL FOR THAT?"

19:45.967 --> 19:47.333
EQUIFAX, THAT'S WHO.

19:47.333 --> 19:48.066
BECAUSE THEY TWEETED LINKS

19:48.066 --> 19:49.033
TO THAT FAKE SITE

19:49.033 --> 19:53.033
AT LEAST EIGHT TIMES.

19:53.033 --> 19:54.300
DESPITE THE FACT THE SITE HAD

19:54.300 --> 19:55.867
A COUPLE OF TINY CLUES THAT IT

19:55.867 --> 19:57.500
MIGHT BE FAKE, FROM THE HEADLINE

19:57.500 --> 19:58.900
READING, "WHY DID EQUIFAX USE

19:58.900 --> 20:00.367
A DOMAIN THAT'S SO EASILY

20:01.867 --> 20:02.567
TO THE FACT THAT,

20:03.400 --> 20:04.767
"FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS,"

THIS HAPPENED.

20:15.166 --> 20:16.066
PRANKSTERS.

20:16.066 --> 20:18.000
YOU HAVE MY RESPECT.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.967
BUT DON'T WORRY, EQUIFAX HAS

20:19.967 --> 20:21.967
TIGHTENED UP THEIR OPERATION.

20:21.967 --> 20:22.934
AND TO SEE HOW WELL THEY'VE

20:22.934 --> 20:24.734
DONE, YOU CAN JUST GO TO

20:24.734 --> 20:26.600
EquifaxFraudPrevention.com.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.133
NOT BECAUSE IT'S THEIR SITE,

20:28.133 --> 20:29.567
BUT BECAUSE IT'S OUR SITE.

20:29.567 --> 20:31.300
WE BOUGHT IT TWO DAYS AGO.

20:31.300 --> 20:32.967
AND IF YOU GO THERE, YOU'LL FIND

20:32.967 --> 20:33.900
THE MESSAGE, "HOW WERE WE STILL

20:33.900 --> 20:35.200
ABLE TO DO THIS?

20:35.200 --> 20:35.867
WHY HAVEN'T YOU LEARNED

20:35.867 --> 20:41.166
ANYTHING?"

20:41.166 --> 20:42.400
BUT WAIT, THERE'S EVEN MORE.

20:42.400 --> 20:43.066
BECAUSE EQUIFAX ALSO OFFERED

20:43.066 --> 20:43.700
CONSUMERS A YEAR OF FREE CREDIT

20:43.700 --> 20:44.533
MONITORING.

20:44.533 --> 20:45.533
BUT WHEN PEOPLE TRIED TO SIGN UP

20:45.533 --> 20:46.300
FOR THE SERVICE, THEY NOTICED

20:46.300 --> 20:48.633
SOMETHING.

20:48.633 --> 20:49.934
>> GUESS WHAT, YOU LOCK INTO

20:49.934 --> 20:51.633
EQUIFAX TERMS OF SERVICE WHEN

20:51.633 --> 20:53.700
YOU SIGN UP FOR IT, WHICH MEANS

20:53.700 --> 20:56.033
THAT YOU CAN'T SUE THE COMPANY.

20:56.033 --> 20:57.467
YOU HAVE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTES

20:57.467 --> 21:02.967
IN FORCED ARBITRATION.

21:02.967 --> 21:04.400
>> John: EXACTLY, YOU'D BE

21:04.400 --> 21:05.600
GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO SUE, SO

21:05.600 --> 21:06.734
LEGALLY, YOUR BEST RECOURSE

21:06.734 --> 21:08.767
WOULD BE SHAKING YOUR FIST AT

21:08.767 --> 21:10.433
THE HEAVENS WHILE SHOUTING

21:10.433 --> 21:11.367
"EQUIFAX!"

21:11.367 --> 21:12.200
NOW, THEY'VE SINCE RESCINDED

21:12.200 --> 21:12.934
THAT CLAUSE.

21:12.934 --> 21:13.567
ALTHOUGH MANY FRUSTRATED PEOPLE

21:13.567 --> 21:14.500
ARE NOW SIGNING UP FOR

21:14.500 --> 21:16.567
THIRD-PARTY CREDIT-MONITORING

21:16.567 --> 21:17.433
SERVICES LIKE LIFELOCK, WHO'VE

21:17.433 --> 21:19.667
BEEN ADVERTISING EVERYWHERE,

21:19.667 --> 21:20.934
AND HAVE SEEN A SURGE

21:20.934 --> 21:21.567
IN BUSINESS IN THE WAKE OF

21:21.567 --> 21:22.300
THE BREACH.

21:22.300 --> 21:23.834
ALTHOUGH, IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING

21:23.834 --> 21:24.567
LIFELOCK BECAUSE YOU'RE MAD

21:24.567 --> 21:26.166
AT EQUIFAX, THERE'S SOMETHING

21:26.166 --> 21:28.200
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

21:28.200 --> 21:29.333
>> ACCORDING TO FILINGS WITH THE

21:29.333 --> 21:31.867
SEC, LIFELOCK PURCHASES CREDIT

21:31.867 --> 21:33.633
MONITORING SERVICES

21:33.633 --> 21:36.266
FROM EQUIFAX.

21:36.266 --> 21:37.500
AND THAT MEANS SOMEONE BUYS

21:37.500 --> 21:38.867
CREDIT MONITORING THROUGH

21:38.867 --> 21:41.300
LIFELOCK, LIFELOCK TURNS AROUND

21:41.300 --> 21:43.800
AND PASSES SOME OF THAT REVENUE

21:43.800 --> 21:45.533
DIRECTLY ALONG TO EQUIFAX,

21:45.533 --> 21:47.433
IS THAT RIGHT, MR. SMITH?

21:47.433 --> 21:55.300
>> THAT IS CORRECT.

21:55.300 --> 21:56.367
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

21:56.367 --> 21:56.900
SOME OF THE MONEY

21:56.900 --> 21:58.900
YOU PAY TO LIFELOCK GOES RIGHT

21:58.900 --> 22:01.367
BACK TO FUCKING EQUIFAX, WHICH

22:01.367 --> 22:02.734
COULD ONLY BE MORE INFURIATING

22:02.734 --> 22:04.633
IF YOU THEN FOUND OUT THE REST

22:04.633 --> 22:06.500
OF IT GOES TO TOYS FOR TODDS,

22:06.500 --> 22:07.734
A CHARITY THAT PURCHASES

22:07.734 --> 22:08.834
SEX TOYS FOR GROWN MEN

22:08.834 --> 22:16.266
NAMED TODD.

22:16.266 --> 22:17.700
BUY YOUR OWN SEX TOYS, TODD.

22:17.700 --> 22:18.667
AND EQUIFAX CONNECTIONS ASIDE,

22:18.667 --> 22:19.333
LIFELOCK HAS HAD REPEATED ISSUES

22:19.333 --> 22:20.333
ITSELF, INCLUDING MULTIPLE

22:20.333 --> 22:21.667
SETTLEMENTS WITH THE FTC

22:21.667 --> 22:22.500
AND A TRULY DISASTROUS

22:22.500 --> 22:24.500
AD CAMPAIGN A FEW YEARS BACK.

22:24.500 --> 22:25.800
>> I'M TODD DAVIS.

22:25.800 --> 22:27.133
AND I'M HERE TO PROVE JUST HOW

22:27.133 --> 22:29.233
SAFE YOUR IDENTITY CAN BE

22:29.233 --> 22:30.633
WITH LIFELOCK.

22:30.633 --> 22:31.667
THAT'S MY REAL SOCIAL SECURITY

22:31.667 --> 22:33.266
NUMBER.

22:33.266 --> 22:34.633
>> John: YEAH.

22:34.633 --> 22:35.967
LIFELOCK'S THEN-CEO, TODD DAVIS,

22:35.967 --> 22:36.934
ACTUALLY PUT HIS REAL SOCIAL

22:36.934 --> 22:39.400
SECURITY NUMBER,

22:39.400 --> 22:41.900
457-55-5462, ON A TRUCK

22:41.900 --> 22:42.967
AND BILLBOARDS.

22:42.967 --> 22:43.867
FOR A TIME, IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE

22:43.867 --> 22:44.734
TO ESCAPE HIS SOCIAL SECURITY

22:44.734 --> 22:46.400
NUMBER.

22:46.400 --> 22:49.967
457-55-5462.

22:49.967 --> 22:51.300
IT WAS A COCKY MOVE AND ONE THAT

22:51.300 --> 22:52.767
RESULTED IN HIM HAVING

22:52.767 --> 22:55.700
HIS IDENTITY STOLEN 13 TIMES.

22:55.700 --> 22:58.000
AND I'M GUESSING THE DEFENSE

22:58.000 --> 22:59.467
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO TOOK IT WAS,

22:59.467 --> 23:01.266
"I DIDN'T STEAL HIS IDENTITY.

23:01.266 --> 23:02.700
I LITERALLY GOT IT OFF

23:02.700 --> 23:04.800
THE BACK OF A TRUCK."

23:04.800 --> 23:06.633
SO TO PUT IT MILDLY, LIFELOCK

23:06.633 --> 23:07.567
MAY NOT BE YOUR BEST SOLUTION

23:07.567 --> 23:10.133
TO THE EQUIFAX CRISIS.

23:10.133 --> 23:11.300
SO WHAT IS?

23:11.300 --> 23:12.667
WELL, CONSUMER ADVOCATES TOLD US

23:12.667 --> 23:14.867
THE ONE BIG STEP EVERYONE SHOULD

23:14.867 --> 23:16.033
TAKE IS GO TO ALL THREE LARGE

23:16.033 --> 23:17.767
CREDIT-REPORTING COMPANIES.

23:17.767 --> 23:18.734
THAT'S EQUIFAX, EXPERIAN,

23:18.734 --> 23:19.834
AND TRANSUNION, AND FREEZE

23:19.834 --> 23:21.567
YOUR CREDIT.

23:21.567 --> 23:22.867
THAT WAY, NO ONE CAN ACCESS IT,

23:22.867 --> 23:24.200
INCLUDING YOU, UNTIL YOU

23:24.200 --> 23:25.433
UN-FREEZE IT.

23:25.433 --> 23:26.133
NOW, THE COMPANIES ALSO OFFER

23:26.133 --> 23:27.467
THEIR OWN CREDIT-PROTECTION

23:27.467 --> 23:29.166
PRODUCTS, WITH NAMES LIKE

23:29.166 --> 23:30.700
"TRUSTED ID," OR "CREDIT LOCK

23:30.700 --> 23:32.767
PLUS," BUT THEY'RE OFTEN MORE

23:32.767 --> 23:34.467
EXPENSIVE AND OFFER FEWER

23:34.467 --> 23:36.500
CONSUMER PROTECTIONS.

23:36.500 --> 23:37.300
IF YOU NEED A WAY TO REMEMBER

23:37.300 --> 23:38.266
IT, LOCKS ARE SOMETHING

23:38.266 --> 23:39.967
YOU DON'T WANT.

23:39.967 --> 23:40.967
THINK OF JUSTIN BIEBER'S

23:40.967 --> 23:42.233
DREADLOCKS.

23:42.233 --> 23:45.300
A TERRIBLE DECISION.

23:45.300 --> 23:48.166
WHEREAS FREEZES ARE GREAT.

23:48.166 --> 23:49.500
THINK OF THIS TINY PENGUIN

23:49.500 --> 23:53.934
LOSING ITS FROZEN MIND.

23:53.934 --> 24:00.133
♪ ♪

24:00.133 --> 24:00.767
SEE?

24:00.767 --> 24:01.300
SO, TO RECAP.

24:01.300 --> 24:01.700
LOCKS?

24:01.700 --> 24:02.667
YUCK.

24:02.667 --> 24:03.066
FREEZES?

24:03.066 --> 24:03.700
WHEE!

24:03.700 --> 24:05.500
NOW, HERE'S THE THING.

24:05.500 --> 24:07.066
FREEZING AND UNFREEZING

24:07.066 --> 24:08.734
YOUR CREDIT CAN COST MONEY,

24:08.734 --> 24:09.367
WHICH WILL GO BACK TO

24:09.367 --> 24:10.934
THESE COMPANIES.

24:10.934 --> 24:12.533
BECAUSE SEEMINGLY, THEY JUST

24:12.533 --> 24:14.367
CAN'T FUCKING LOSE.

24:14.367 --> 24:15.867
AND IF YOU NEED ANY MORE PROOF

24:15.867 --> 24:17.233
OF THAT, ON THE VERY SAME DAY

24:17.233 --> 24:18.400
THAT CONGRESS WAS YELLING AT

24:18.400 --> 24:19.934
EQUIFAX'S FORMER CEO, IT EMERGED

24:19.934 --> 24:21.400
THAT THE COMPANY HAD JUST BEEN

24:21.400 --> 24:23.667
AWARDED A $7 MILLION CONTRACT

24:23.667 --> 24:26.934
BY THE IRS TO PREVENT FRAUD.

24:26.934 --> 24:28.533
WHICH LED ONE SENATOR TO MAKE

24:28.533 --> 24:31.100
A PRETTY BRUTAL COMPARISON.

24:31.100 --> 24:32.967
>> YOU REALIZE TO MANY AMERICANS

24:32.967 --> 24:36.166
RIGHT NOW THAT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE

24:36.166 --> 24:38.000
GIVING LINDSAY LOHAN THE KEYS

24:38.000 --> 24:44.100
TO THE MINIBAR.

24:44.100 --> 24:46.200
>> I UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT.

24:46.200 --> 24:46.867
>> John: THAT WAS THE PAUSE

24:46.867 --> 24:47.734
OF A MAN THINKING,

24:47.734 --> 24:49.633
"DO I LET THAT PASS?

24:49.633 --> 24:50.600
DO I CORRECT HIM ON HOW

24:50.600 --> 24:52.033
TO PRONOUNCE LOHAN?

24:52.033 --> 24:53.266
OR DO I DOUBLE DOWN

24:53.266 --> 24:54.266
AND PRONOUNCE HER NAME

24:54.266 --> 24:57.300
LINGONBERRY LOHONEYBALONEY?"

24:57.300 --> 24:58.633
AND YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT IRS

24:58.633 --> 25:00.100
DEAL HAS BEEN SUSPENDED.

25:00.100 --> 25:01.133
NOT CANCELED, BY THE WAY,

25:01.133 --> 25:03.033
JUST SUSPENDED,

25:03.033 --> 25:04.300
WHICH MIGHT MAKE YOU ANGRY.

25:04.300 --> 25:05.900
THE PROBLEM IS, THAT ANGER WON'T

25:05.900 --> 25:08.633
HAVE MUCH IMPACT ON EQUIFAX.

25:08.633 --> 25:09.600
THEY MAKE MOST OF THEIR MONEY

25:09.600 --> 25:10.633
SELLING OUR DATA TO BUSINESSES

25:10.633 --> 25:11.633
LIKE BANKS.

25:11.633 --> 25:12.867
SO IN THEIR EYES, WE'RE NOT

25:12.867 --> 25:14.133
THE CONSUMER.

25:14.133 --> 25:16.166
WE'RE THE PRODUCT.

25:16.166 --> 25:17.633
TO THINK OF IT IN TERMS OF KFC,

25:17.633 --> 25:19.200
WE'RE NOT THE GUY BUYING THE

25:19.200 --> 25:20.266
TEN-PIECE BUCKETS.

25:20.266 --> 25:22.567
WE'RE THE FUCKING CHICKENS.

25:22.567 --> 25:23.867
SO FOR THE TIME BEING,

25:23.867 --> 25:24.667
BUSINESSES ARE THE ONLY ONES

25:24.667 --> 25:26.000
WHO CAN EXERT INFLUENCE HERE.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.033
AND AS ONE COLORFULLY DRESSED

25:27.033 --> 25:28.500
EXPERT POINTED OUT, THAT'S NOT

25:28.500 --> 25:30.533
GOING TO HAPPEN ANYTIME SOON.

25:30.533 --> 25:32.667
>> I HAVEN'T HEARD ANY BIG

25:32.667 --> 25:34.300
COMPANY COME OUT YET AND SAY

25:34.300 --> 25:35.233
WE'RE NOT GOING TO USE EQUIFAX

25:35.233 --> 25:36.900
ANYMORE FOR THEIR CREDIT SCORES.

25:36.900 --> 25:38.767
>> GOOD POINT.

25:38.767 --> 25:39.900
>> SO FAR, EVERYBODY'S BEEN

25:39.900 --> 25:40.467
QUIET, AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT

25:40.467 --> 25:40.967
THEY'RE WAITING TO HEAR.

25:40.967 --> 25:42.133
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.

25:42.133 --> 25:43.166
THEY SHOULD BE DONE.

25:43.166 --> 25:45.400
BUT I BET YOU BECAUSE

25:45.400 --> 25:46.967
IT'S AMERICA, THEY'LL BE OKAY.

25:46.967 --> 25:48.767
>> John: HERE'S THE THING.

25:48.767 --> 25:50.033
THAT ANGRY BUSINESS-CASUAL

25:50.033 --> 25:51.533
FARM ANIMAL ON FOX BUSINESS

25:51.533 --> 25:54.700
IS TALKING SENSE.

25:54.700 --> 25:55.934
AND THAT SENTENCE SHOWS JUST HOW

25:55.934 --> 25:57.166
BAD THINGS ARE.

25:57.166 --> 25:58.734
SO IN THE LONG TERM, THERE

25:58.734 --> 26:01.633
SHOULD CLEARLY BE A MAJOR REFORM

26:01.633 --> 26:02.200
TO THIS INDUSTRY AND HOW

26:02.200 --> 26:03.300
IT'S REGULATED.

26:03.300 --> 26:04.033
BUT THAT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME.

26:04.033 --> 26:05.000
UNTIL THEN, YOU NEED TO FREEZE

26:05.000 --> 26:06.367
YOUR CREDIT REPORTS WITH

26:06.367 --> 26:07.700
ALL THREE OF THESE COMPANIES,

26:07.700 --> 26:09.333
AND ONLY UN-FREEZE THEM WHEN YOU

26:09.333 --> 26:10.600
NEED TO APPLY FOR CREDIT.

26:10.600 --> 26:12.000
AND BECAUSE THE FREEZE OPTION

26:12.000 --> 26:13.600
CAN BE HARD TO FIND ON THEIR

26:13.600 --> 26:14.767
SITES, IF YOU GO TO OUR TWITTER

26:14.767 --> 26:15.934
FEED, WE WILL GIVE YOU THE EXACT

26:15.934 --> 26:17.433
LINKS TO DO IT.

26:17.433 --> 26:21.934
AND WHEN YOU DO, THEY'LL GIVE

26:21.934 --> 26:22.867
YOU A PIN NUMBER THAT YOU NEED

26:22.867 --> 26:24.033
TO UN-FREEZE IT, SO DON'T LOSE

26:24.033 --> 26:25.467
THAT, OR AT LEAST MAKE IT

26:25.467 --> 26:27.033
SOMETHING MEMORABLE,

26:27.033 --> 26:30.200
LIKE 457-55-5462.

26:30.200 --> 26:31.033
BUT NOT THAT.

26:31.033 --> 26:32.433
BECAUSE OF COURSE,

26:32.433 --> 26:33.333
THAT'S TODD DAVIS'S

26:33.333 --> 26:35.300
SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER.

26:35.300 --> 26:38.033
AND NOW THIS.

26:38.033 --> 26:47.433
>> Announcer: AND NOW:

26:47.433 --> 26:48.066
NEW YORK CITY MAYORAL CANDIDATE

26:48.066 --> 26:49.500

26:49.500 --> 26:52.000
>> WE BEGIN WITH OPENING

26:52.000 --> 26:53.367

26:53.367 --> 26:56.834

26:56.834 --> 27:00.200
I WAS MUGGED 500 TIMES.

27:00.200 --> 27:01.600
STABBED, SHOT AT, HOSPITALIZED.

27:01.600 --> 27:03.500
WHAT DID YOU MAKE LAST YEAR?

27:03.500 --> 27:05.233
I MADE 1.8 MILLION.

27:05.233 --> 27:07.500
IF I HAD MY HEAD IN A POTATO

27:07.500 --> 27:08.967

27:08.967 --> 27:10.166
MAN, I WOULD SAY I WOULD VOTE

27:10.166 --> 27:14.633
FOR HIM TOO.

27:14.633 --> 27:17.200
THE GUY WAS GUARDING MOOSE.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.834
>> MR. DIETL.

27:18.834 --> 27:19.734
I HAVEN'T ASKED THE QUESTION

27:19.734 --> 27:21.800

27:21.800 --> 27:24.700

27:50.266 --> 27:50.767
YOU KEEP INTERRUPTING.

27:50.767 --> 27:54.066

27:58.834 --> 28:00.834
YOU REFERRED TO YOUR ATTORNEY AS

28:00.834 --> 28:02.600
YOUR "JEWISH LAWYER" AND YOU

28:02.600 --> 28:04.000
SAID YOU KNEW YOU LOST YOUR

AFRICAN-AMERICAN JUDGE, YOU

28:08.734 --> 28:12.200
SAID, IT LOOKED LIKE BILL

>> YOU ARE WRONG, WHAT YOU JUST
