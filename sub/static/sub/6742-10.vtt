02:21.575 --> 02:22.910
What was that?

02:25.213 --> 02:26.347
A nightmare.

02:26.347 --> 02:27.781
With me in it.
How is that possible?

02:27.781 --> 02:28.882
I don't know.

02:41.094 --> 02:42.230
Frank.

02:44.865 --> 02:47.635
There was another man
kneeling near you

02:47.635 --> 02:50.571
in the film.
Did you recognize him?

02:51.805 --> 02:54.575
What? No. Why?

02:56.544 --> 02:58.446
He looked familiar to me.

02:58.446 --> 02:59.680
[door closes]

03:13.261 --> 03:15.596
Bad news. I didn't
find a way out.

03:24.272 --> 03:26.474
What is it? Something happen?

03:27.375 --> 03:29.277
Everything's fine.

03:38.085 --> 03:40.288
Okay,
so give me the film.

03:41.489 --> 03:42.656
No.

03:44.292 --> 03:45.493
No.

03:52.099 --> 03:53.967
Stop it. Stop.

04:00.508 --> 04:02.310
You Nazi fuck!

04:04.312 --> 04:05.879
Tell me it isn't true.

04:05.879 --> 04:07.481
Tell me it isn't true.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.551
Please tell me
it isn't true.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.353

04:43.250 --> 04:44.418
Helen: John?

04:49.222 --> 04:50.491
I couldn't sleep.

04:53.694 --> 04:56.697
If he simply wanted me
dead, Helen,

04:56.697 --> 04:59.367
he wouldn't need
to invite me hunting.

05:00.668 --> 05:03.270
Heydrich scares me,
John.

05:03.270 --> 05:05.706
H-He says it's for
the glory of the Reich,

05:05.706 --> 05:09.443
but he enjoys
the things that he does.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.649
Listen to me, Helen.

05:19.387 --> 05:21.655
I need you
to promise me something.

05:21.655 --> 05:22.890
Mm-hmm.

05:22.890 --> 05:26.627
If for whatever reason
I don't make it back--

05:29.430 --> 05:32.666
don't let that man
near our children.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.011

Enter.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.007
[speaking Japanese]

06:18.612 --> 06:21.281
This is our world now,
Sergeant.

06:21.281 --> 06:24.985
Part of the Empire.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.487
And it is our duty

06:26.487 --> 06:30.123
to sacrifice
whatever is necessary

06:30.123 --> 06:32.325
to protect it.

06:32.325 --> 06:33.927
Yes, sir.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.536
Karen: You don't ever
watch the films.

06:42.536 --> 06:45.506
- No exceptions.
- It doesn't matter
to us what you saw.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.841
I just saw myself being
executed by Joe Blake.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.810
And the whole city
destroyed by an A bomb.

06:49.810 --> 06:52.480
We just paid the Yakuza
10,000 yen for you,

06:52.480 --> 06:54.482
and now you're asking us
to get you out?

06:54.482 --> 06:57.117
Look, Frank's wanted
by the Kempeitai.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.321
And neither of you
thought to mention that?

07:01.321 --> 07:02.990
Will you help us
or not?

07:02.990 --> 07:04.057
[sigh]

07:13.266 --> 07:15.669
[voices on television]

07:31.585 --> 07:33.153
Major Karl MÃ¼ller
of the Reich?

07:33.153 --> 07:35.122
Kempeitai
Chief Inspector Kido.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.861
Please come in.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.005
[floor creaks]

08:52.499 --> 08:53.734
Chief Inspector.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.678
This belongs to you?

09:04.678 --> 09:06.680
Yes, Inspector.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.949
And I'm prepared
to make a full confession.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.703
[no audible dialogue]

09:44.017 --> 09:45.986
Okay.
We can get you out.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.455
But it's going to cost you.

09:48.455 --> 09:51.291
We don't have anything left.

09:53.226 --> 09:54.394
What do you want?

09:54.394 --> 09:55.729
Your help

09:55.729 --> 09:57.865
getting that film
back from Joe Blake

09:57.865 --> 09:59.199
and killing him.

10:01.534 --> 10:04.104
Help us do that, and I'm
cleared to put you
on a boat to Mexico.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.505
Killing him?
A few hours ago,

10:05.505 --> 10:07.708
I gave everything I had
to save the son of a bitch.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.376
Wait. Because of what's
on the film?

10:09.376 --> 10:10.911
Because he's a goddamn Nazi.

10:10.911 --> 10:12.545
You said he didn't deny it.

10:12.545 --> 10:13.914
He makes it
back to New York,

10:13.914 --> 10:15.749
that film and all
of our names

10:15.749 --> 10:17.951
go to Nazi
High Command.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.019
Fuck.

10:19.019 --> 10:19.987
Juliana.

10:22.555 --> 10:24.057
You're the only one
who stands a chance

10:24.057 --> 10:25.425
of getting
close enough to him

10:25.425 --> 10:27.728
to do it
and grab the film.

10:27.728 --> 10:30.030
Lemuel: You're
the only one he trusts.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.331
You want to kill him?

10:31.331 --> 10:32.833
You go right ahead,
but leave her out of it.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.201
Well, you did it before.

10:34.201 --> 10:35.836
The Nazi agent
back in Canon City.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.170
That was self-defense.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.272
You're asking me to kill
a man in cold blood,

10:39.272 --> 10:40.540
to assassinate him.

10:40.540 --> 10:41.541
Ah...

10:41.541 --> 10:43.276
No.

10:43.276 --> 10:44.577
I can't do that.

10:44.577 --> 10:45.746
I won't do that.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.047
I know.

10:47.047 --> 10:48.682
Uh...

10:54.587 --> 10:55.889
I'll do it.

10:58.926 --> 11:00.928
Fish to the lure.

11:00.928 --> 11:02.195
You get him someplace

11:02.195 --> 11:04.364
where I can get a nice
clean decent shot.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.633
I'll do the rest.

11:06.633 --> 11:08.736
Oh, my God.

11:20.480 --> 11:21.949
Go through his desk.

11:21.949 --> 11:25.185
Anything official
must be destroyed.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.798
I do not understand,
sir.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.534
I think you do, Sergeant.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.104
What is this man's crime?

11:44.104 --> 11:46.139
The shooting
of the Crown Prince.

11:46.139 --> 11:47.307
Hai.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.276
But we've been
pursuing Frank Frink.

11:49.276 --> 11:54.114
The witness said Frank never
discharged his weapon.

11:54.114 --> 11:56.784
Then why not arrest
and interrogate this man?

11:56.784 --> 12:00.387
Because that is
exactly what the Nazis
would want us to do.

12:02.956 --> 12:04.357
There'd be war.

12:04.357 --> 12:08.195
A war that currently
our Empire cannot win.

12:10.964 --> 12:15.068
Nobody must ever know
about this, Sergeant.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.603
But if Frink is gone

12:16.603 --> 12:17.871
and we cannot
report the capture

12:17.871 --> 12:19.807
of the real assassin,

12:19.807 --> 12:21.408
how can Tokyo be satisfied?

12:25.312 --> 12:27.948
Whatever sacrifice
is necessary.

12:31.351 --> 12:34.087
That is my burden alone,

12:34.087 --> 12:36.356
and I shall carry it.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.828
Yours is to remain silent

12:40.828 --> 12:43.196
and to act as my Kaishakunin.

12:44.297 --> 12:48.001
Now do you understand,
Yoshida-san?

12:50.838 --> 12:52.139
Hai.

12:53.640 --> 12:54.842
The desk.

13:35.748 --> 13:37.918
OberstgruppenfÃ¼hrer.

13:39.552 --> 13:40.888
Sieg heil.

13:40.888 --> 13:42.522
Good morning, John.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.057
This is Junge, my aid.

13:45.525 --> 13:48.728
I brought rifles
for both of us, John.

13:48.728 --> 13:51.598
Oh, thank you.
I prefer to use my own.

14:22.262 --> 14:24.597
Karen: I need you to listen
to me carefully, Juliana.

14:24.597 --> 14:28.368
He's a Nazi, so the Embassy is
the only place he can go now.

14:28.368 --> 14:31.038
Once you're inside,
ask for the visa office.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.405
It's on the eighth floor.

14:32.405 --> 14:35.208
They'll send you
to the back stairs,

14:35.208 --> 14:37.710
and that gives you
access to all levels.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.179
Somebody will tell me

14:39.179 --> 14:41.081
if you managed to contact
ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer Smith.

14:41.081 --> 14:42.515
Yes, Mr. Blake.

14:42.515 --> 14:44.985
He'll probably be in one
of the ad men offices--

14:44.985 --> 14:47.387
levels 4 to 6.

14:47.387 --> 14:50.057
We can get you in, but you
have to get him out.

14:50.057 --> 14:52.759
You'll need a story.
He'll be suspicious.

14:52.759 --> 14:54.962
I'll come up
with something.

14:58.498 --> 15:01.668
Heydrich: I felt we should
clear the air, you and I,

15:01.668 --> 15:03.303
rid ourselves of the suspicion

15:03.303 --> 15:05.205
that seems to have
developed between us.

15:05.205 --> 15:07.440
We can speak candidly here.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.643
Nobody can hear us
or reach us.

15:12.012 --> 15:14.081
I assumed that was the point.

15:14.081 --> 15:17.384
[chuckling] You are
a formidable man, John.

15:18.618 --> 15:21.688
You believe
Captain Connolly had a hand

15:21.688 --> 15:23.190
in the ambush on your car?

15:23.190 --> 15:26.726
As Captain Connolly
killed himself yesterday,

15:26.726 --> 15:28.461
sadly we can only speculate.

15:28.461 --> 15:31.631
You must at least suspect
I gave the order.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.435
It's understandable.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.870
There is, after all,
strong precedent

15:37.870 --> 15:40.207
for senior figures
removing comrades

15:40.207 --> 15:42.009
in pursuit
of the greater good.

15:42.009 --> 15:48.015
but sometimes such figures
underestimate their comrades.

15:49.282 --> 15:52.052
I would hate
to make that mistake.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.755
The world will change
forever today.

15:55.755 --> 15:58.925
It's too late for us to do
anything about that.

15:58.925 --> 16:00.660
Now it's simply a question

16:00.660 --> 16:04.531
of whether you are part of
the future or the past.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.991
This is OberfÃ¼hrer Diels.

18:11.991 --> 18:13.893
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.195
My staff booked you

18:15.195 --> 18:16.963
on the first rocket
back to New York.

18:16.963 --> 18:18.398
You leave in a few hours.

18:18.398 --> 18:20.066
Make yourself comfortable
in here until then.

18:20.066 --> 18:22.435
- I have further meetings.
- Okay. Thank you, sir.

18:27.174 --> 18:29.209
You report to
ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer Smith,

18:29.209 --> 18:30.243
do you not, Mr. Blake?

18:30.243 --> 18:31.944
Yeah, that's correct.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.246
Have you spoken to him?

18:33.246 --> 18:36.383
We're still
trying to reach him.

18:36.383 --> 18:39.252
So your mission here
was a success?

18:43.256 --> 18:45.192
I can't
really talk about that.

18:46.693 --> 18:47.827
Of course.

19:14.354 --> 19:15.822
[speaking Japanese]

19:17.056 --> 19:19.326
Chief Inspector Kido,
Trade Minister.

19:24.964 --> 19:26.766
Juliana Crain.

19:26.766 --> 19:29.402
Miss Crain is not
in the office today.

19:29.402 --> 19:31.037
I am aware of that.

19:31.037 --> 19:33.373
Nor will she be ever again.

19:33.373 --> 19:36.075
She is the girlfriend
of Frank Frink,

19:36.075 --> 19:37.844
the man wanted in connection

19:37.844 --> 19:39.779
with the shooting
of the Crown Prince.

19:44.083 --> 19:46.486
I'm sure there must be
some mistake.

19:46.486 --> 19:48.988
There have undoubtedly
been several,

19:48.988 --> 19:51.958
along with warnings unheeded.

19:51.958 --> 19:54.561
I am sorry, Trade Minister.

19:54.561 --> 19:56.896
I can do nothing
about the loss of face

19:56.896 --> 19:59.031
you will suffer
in connection with this

19:59.031 --> 20:02.535
as and when Mr. Frink
is inevitably apprehended.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.971
But this time there can
be no mitigation.

20:04.971 --> 20:05.938
This time?

20:07.640 --> 20:10.643
Did you really think
I did not know

20:10.643 --> 20:13.946
who helped the Nazi
Wegener to leave?

20:19.486 --> 20:22.188
However, I also knew
why you did so.

20:22.188 --> 20:25.124
Please, do not imagine
I remained silent

20:25.124 --> 20:28.094
for any other reason
than your own:

20:28.094 --> 20:30.563
the security of the Empire.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.865
Why are you telling me now?

20:38.271 --> 20:39.772
Because there comes a time

20:39.772 --> 20:41.408
when all men
must bear the weight

20:41.408 --> 20:44.544
of their responsibility,
Trade Minister.

20:46.813 --> 20:49.015

23:30.109 --> 23:31.978
It's going to be okay.

23:31.978 --> 23:34.814
In a few hours
we'll be free of all this.

23:34.814 --> 23:37.850
Running away isn't
the same as being free.

23:42.522 --> 23:45.892
Look, I want you
to promise me.

23:45.892 --> 23:48.294
If anything happens,
you get on that boat.

23:48.294 --> 23:49.496
Hey, don't even think that.

23:49.496 --> 23:51.498
Think about
what's on the other side.

23:51.498 --> 23:55.334
That film
shows Joe as a Nazi,

23:55.334 --> 23:57.036
and he is.

24:00.573 --> 24:02.742
I got on that bus
with Trudy's film

24:02.742 --> 24:04.911
because I thought it meant
hope for the future.

24:04.911 --> 24:07.113
But this new one means
that everything I've done

24:07.113 --> 24:10.316
and everything I've caused
has been for nothing.

24:10.316 --> 24:12.151
There is no hope.

24:13.986 --> 24:15.922
There's no future.

24:20.727 --> 24:23.530
But we have to go on.

24:25.532 --> 24:27.199
What else is there?

24:38.277 --> 24:39.746
Okay.

24:45.117 --> 24:46.553
Let's go.

26:13.439 --> 26:14.641
Ed.

26:16.843 --> 26:18.344
What are you doing in here?

26:18.344 --> 26:20.680
Uh...

26:20.680 --> 26:23.716
I, uh, I messed up
on the detailing, sir.

26:23.716 --> 26:25.051
I thought I'd melt it

26:25.051 --> 26:26.753
before production tallies
were recorded.

26:26.753 --> 26:28.655
You're too much
of a damn perfectionist.

26:32.291 --> 26:34.026
This barrel's been bored out.

26:35.127 --> 26:36.663
- Sir--
- Tell me this is not

26:36.663 --> 26:38.030
what the Kempeitai
are looking for.

29:11.550 --> 29:13.185
[speaking Japanese]

29:24.596 --> 29:26.198
Trade Minister.

29:29.969 --> 29:32.071
Your meeting,
Trade Minister.

29:37.944 --> 29:40.479
The only way...

29:40.479 --> 29:44.851
to view the truth
of life, Kotomichi...

29:47.119 --> 29:49.721
is to stand apart from it,

29:49.721 --> 29:52.258
to see...

29:56.128 --> 30:02.268
the consequence
of every thought,

30:02.268 --> 30:04.036
every action.

30:05.304 --> 30:08.340
But still...

30:08.340 --> 30:12.311
we are bound
by time and space,

30:12.311 --> 30:15.014
unable to steer
our destiny.

30:15.014 --> 30:18.117
That is why you consult
the i ching...

30:19.085 --> 30:21.253
to glimpse
what lies ahead.

30:21.253 --> 30:24.756
I'm nothing but a misguided
fool, Kotomichi.

30:24.756 --> 30:25.992
No.

30:25.992 --> 30:28.160
You are a good man.

30:30.863 --> 30:33.966
Perhaps too good
for this world.

30:37.803 --> 30:40.206
You must not lose faith,
Trade Minister.

30:40.206 --> 30:42.574
You must not
give up on meditation

30:42.574 --> 30:43.976
and not on searching.

30:43.976 --> 30:45.945
You must not--

30:47.813 --> 30:53.119
Kotomichi, what's the matter?

31:02.828 --> 31:04.931
The mine owners
and General Hata

31:04.931 --> 31:06.298
are waiting for you
in Bara.

31:11.837 --> 31:13.305
Cancel it.

31:13.305 --> 31:15.574
I'll be leaving for the day.

31:48.307 --> 31:50.542
[chatter]

33:33.212 --> 33:35.481

33:52.098 --> 33:53.665
[ring]

33:53.665 --> 33:55.734
Sir.

33:55.734 --> 33:57.269
Ambassador Reiss.

33:57.269 --> 34:00.106
No. He's not here
at the moment.

34:00.106 --> 34:02.108
Mr. Blake,
This is Major Klemm.

34:02.108 --> 34:03.775
Where the hell
have you been?

34:05.477 --> 34:07.979
Here. I've been here
like I was told.

34:07.979 --> 34:09.215
They didn't call you?

34:09.215 --> 34:10.782
No. I called
the ambassador

34:10.782 --> 34:12.418
to find out if he'd
heard from you.

34:13.852 --> 34:16.288
Listen to me
very carefully, Mr. Blake.

34:16.288 --> 34:18.690
ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer Smith
has left word.

34:18.690 --> 34:21.026
Diels reports
directly to Heydrich.

34:21.026 --> 34:24.630
You are to stay away
from Diels at all costs.

34:25.864 --> 34:27.966
OberfÃ¼hrer Diels.

34:27.966 --> 34:29.268
Please come with me.

34:31.370 --> 34:33.439
I need a team to
the Embassy immediately.

34:33.439 --> 34:34.473
Yes, sir.

34:34.473 --> 34:36.142
The car to take you
to the airport

34:36.142 --> 34:37.576
is waiting, Mr. Blake.

34:41.247 --> 34:43.282
Have you heard from
ObergruppenfÃ¼hrer Smith?

34:43.282 --> 34:45.184
Oh, yes.
He's expecting you.

34:45.184 --> 34:47.153
Please come with me.

35:03.435 --> 35:06.872
What news on Joe Blake's
mission in the Pacific States?

35:11.643 --> 35:13.512
I take it you sent him
to retrieve

35:13.512 --> 35:16.315
one of the films the FÃ¼hrer
finds so interesting.

35:16.315 --> 35:19.218
I'm sorry.
I can't discuss that.

35:19.218 --> 35:20.686
[rifle cocked]

35:23.189 --> 35:25.191
Time to talk plainly,
John.

35:42.774 --> 35:43.809
Good luck.

35:50.282 --> 35:52.518
[chatter in German]

36:00.459 --> 36:02.728
Basement level, Mr. Blake.

36:07.499 --> 36:09.335
I can't leave
by the front entrance?

36:09.335 --> 36:11.837
Your safety is of
paramount concern to us.

36:11.837 --> 36:12.804
Please.

36:14.906 --> 36:16.242
Of course.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.713
[speaking German]

36:21.713 --> 36:24.383
I'm just here for
a visa application.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.155
Visa application.

36:30.155 --> 36:31.290
Ja.

36:33.759 --> 36:34.926
You can pass.

36:34.926 --> 36:36.528
Danke schoen.

36:57.349 --> 37:00.486
All the way to
the basement, Mr. Blake.

37:24.810 --> 37:27.913
[Men speaking German]

38:14.225 --> 38:15.727
Joe.

38:20.732 --> 38:22.368
What the hell
are you doing here?

38:22.368 --> 38:23.569
How did you
get in here?

38:23.569 --> 38:25.203
You're not the only one
who can lie.

38:25.203 --> 38:27.839
Wait. Not that way.

38:38.384 --> 38:39.785
What the hell
were you doing there?

38:39.785 --> 38:42.020
You lying son of a bitch!

38:43.522 --> 38:45.624
I had to know
if it was true.

38:45.624 --> 38:47.192
Bullshit.
You came for the film.

38:47.192 --> 38:48.860
- That's all you care about.
- That is not true.

38:48.860 --> 38:50.596
- Then why?
- The Resistance sent me

38:50.596 --> 38:52.731
to lure you out
so they can kill you.

38:53.832 --> 38:55.100
And you'd do that?

38:55.100 --> 38:56.402
I've seen
who you really are.

38:56.402 --> 38:57.803
What are you talking about?

38:57.803 --> 38:59.505
We watched the film, Joe.
You're in it.

38:59.505 --> 39:01.239
You're wearing
a Nazi uniform,

39:01.239 --> 39:03.409
and you're executing people.

39:06.412 --> 39:07.913
I don't know what you've seen,

39:07.913 --> 39:10.148
but whatever it is,
it wasn't me.

39:10.148 --> 39:12.083
That's not who I am.

39:12.083 --> 39:14.152
You want to know how I know?

39:14.152 --> 39:15.921
Guess what I saw on the film
I took to Canon City.

39:15.921 --> 39:17.723
You said you never
watched the film.

39:17.723 --> 39:19.791
I didn't tell you because
you were so full of hope.

39:21.259 --> 39:23.294
You saw the Allies
winning, right?

39:23.294 --> 39:24.896
Well, mine wasn't newsreel.

39:24.896 --> 39:28.567
It was Soviet propaganda
for Josef Stalin from 1954.

39:28.567 --> 39:29.601
Stalin was executed--

39:29.601 --> 39:30.902
In '49, exactly.

39:30.902 --> 39:33.439
So whatever you saw
is no more real

39:33.439 --> 39:34.940
than Stalin coming
back from the dead.

39:34.940 --> 39:36.608
You know what is real?

39:36.608 --> 39:40.178
If I don't get this film
back to New York,

39:40.178 --> 39:42.514
I'm a dead man.

39:42.514 --> 39:44.516
And the man I report to
won't just kill me.

39:44.516 --> 39:48.454
He'll kill you, Frank,
and people you're close to.

39:50.155 --> 39:52.924
Help me, and I'll keep all
those names he doesn't know

39:52.924 --> 39:53.992
out of it.

39:56.027 --> 39:57.463
I swear to you.

40:18.650 --> 40:21.920
Does this belong to you,
Mr. McCarthy?

40:23.054 --> 40:24.089
Yes, sir.

40:24.089 --> 40:26.257
You converted it?

40:26.257 --> 40:27.292
That's right.

40:27.292 --> 40:28.994
And you tried to destroy it

40:28.994 --> 40:30.562
because...

40:30.562 --> 40:33.832
Possession of a firearm
is a very serious offense.

40:33.832 --> 40:35.701
But not as serious
as attempting

40:35.701 --> 40:37.335
to assassinate
the Crown Prince of Japan.

40:37.335 --> 40:39.104
This distinctive
weapon was described

40:39.104 --> 40:40.739
by several witnesses.

40:40.739 --> 40:43.675
We know at least two bullets
were fired from this gun.

40:43.675 --> 40:45.977
We are continuing
to pursue Mr. Frank Frink

40:45.977 --> 40:47.112
for this crime,

40:47.112 --> 40:50.582
but if you say this gun
belongs to you,

40:50.582 --> 40:52.283
that changes everything.

40:52.283 --> 40:54.653
Do you know where Frank is?

40:54.653 --> 40:58.323
That is not relevant
to the truth.

40:58.323 --> 41:01.059
The only relevant
question is

41:01.059 --> 41:05.697
did you use this gun
to shoot the Crown Prince?

41:20.612 --> 41:22.848
What is the power
of the films?

41:26.852 --> 41:29.555
Do you know why the FÃ¼hrer
prizes them so highly?

41:30.756 --> 41:32.023
You'd have to address

41:32.023 --> 41:33.725
any questions
on that subject

41:33.725 --> 41:35.594
to the FÃ¼hrer himself.

41:35.594 --> 41:38.229
The FÃ¼hrer
is a spent force, John.

41:38.229 --> 41:39.965
We both know that.

41:41.567 --> 41:43.268
I don't believe for a second

41:43.268 --> 41:45.737
that sharing the land of your
birth with the Japanese

41:45.737 --> 41:47.673
sits well with you.

41:47.673 --> 41:49.941
I'm sure the FÃ¼hrer
has his reasons.

41:51.176 --> 41:54.880
Loyalty is an overrated
virtue, John,

41:54.880 --> 41:56.882
championed by the bovine,

41:56.882 --> 42:00.986
dignified by the weak
to justify their weakness.

42:00.986 --> 42:03.354
It's certainly
not worthy of you.

42:03.354 --> 42:04.823
Neither is betrayal.

42:07.092 --> 42:08.994
Ultimately, John,

42:08.994 --> 42:10.929
we owe our hearts
and our minds

42:10.929 --> 42:13.632
not to any one man
but to an idea,

42:13.632 --> 42:16.635
and that idea
is under threat.

42:16.635 --> 42:20.105
It is up to the best of us
to step forward now

42:20.105 --> 42:23.041
as both the FÃ¼hrer
and nature demands.

42:24.042 --> 42:26.612
The strong
must overcome the weak.

42:56.307 --> 42:58.677
Very shortly now, John,

42:58.677 --> 43:00.779
the telephone
is going to ring.

43:02.447 --> 43:03.915
Who will be calling?

43:03.915 --> 43:07.686
I suspect you already
worked that out on our walk.

43:29.007 --> 43:29.975
Nein!

43:55.901 --> 44:00.305
The American Reich
is vital to our interests.

44:00.305 --> 44:01.873
I'd like you with me,

44:01.873 --> 44:03.574
and I would be
willing to hear

44:03.574 --> 44:05.110
what you would want
for yourself.

44:05.110 --> 44:07.345
However,

44:07.345 --> 44:11.282
I need to be sure
I can call on the same
level of commitment

44:11.282 --> 44:12.718
as the FÃ¼hrer.

44:28.199 --> 44:33.138
I have to hear your decision
before I receive the call.

44:38.209 --> 44:39.377
Okay.

44:39.377 --> 44:40.746
Yeah. I understand.

44:44.750 --> 44:45.851
Was that Lem?

44:45.851 --> 44:47.385
No. We got to go.

44:47.385 --> 44:49.320
At least there should be
fewer Kempeitai around.

44:49.320 --> 44:50.555
Why?

44:50.555 --> 44:52.924
They caught the guy
who shot the Crown Prince.

44:52.924 --> 44:54.760
- Who?
- I don't know.

44:54.760 --> 44:56.561
Some guy who works
in a gun factory.

44:56.561 --> 44:58.029
Come on, Frank.
We got to move.

45:00.999 --> 45:02.300
I got to make a call.

45:02.300 --> 45:04.002
No. We don't
have time for that.

45:09.574 --> 45:12.143
[line ringing]

45:12.143 --> 45:13.444
Mr. McCarthy,

45:13.444 --> 45:15.080
it's Frank.
Is Ed there?

45:15.080 --> 45:16.982
You selfish piece of shit.

45:16.982 --> 45:19.150
They'll kill him.
You know that.

45:19.150 --> 45:20.886
And all because of you.

45:24.522 --> 45:25.957
- Go without me.
- What happened?

45:25.957 --> 45:27.425
Get Juliana away.

45:59.124 --> 46:01.927
[film projector whirring]

46:31.289 --> 46:32.858
Sieg heil!

47:42.560 --> 47:44.095
Heydrich: Well, John?

47:44.095 --> 47:45.997
Rudolph will never
get a weapon

47:45.997 --> 47:47.933
close enough to FÃ¼hrer
to kill him.

47:47.933 --> 47:52.137
Our leader's paranoia
at least has one advantage.

47:53.671 --> 47:55.540
He hides weapons everywhere.

48:10.255 --> 48:12.623
I need to know one thing,
Reinhard.

48:15.426 --> 48:18.563
I need to know
you're not alone in this.

50:01.732 --> 50:03.601
[ring]

50:06.637 --> 50:07.605

50:15.646 --> 50:17.014

50:17.014 --> 50:20.085
No, John.
I am not alone in this.

50:20.951 --> 50:22.553
Now,

50:22.553 --> 50:24.555
are you with me?

50:26.091 --> 50:27.925
Reinhard.

50:27.925 --> 50:29.627
Mein FÃ¼hrer.

[hyperventilating]

50:43.641 --> 50:45.143
[gunshot]

51:38.629 --> 51:40.298
There it is.

51:42.467 --> 51:44.402
I really appreciate
you doing this.

51:44.402 --> 51:46.604
What, sending you
to Mexico?

51:48.072 --> 51:50.308
No, believing in me.

51:52.610 --> 51:54.779
Not many people
have ever done that.

51:57.014 --> 51:58.249
Come on.

52:12.563 --> 52:14.365
She did it.

52:14.365 --> 52:17.101
Do you hear me?
She fucking did it.

52:17.101 --> 52:18.703
Atta girl.

52:28.045 --> 52:29.547
They're on their way to you.

52:29.547 --> 52:31.782
She should take him through
that door any moment.

52:31.782 --> 52:33.584
Copy that.

52:45.996 --> 52:48.766
I guess it's too late
to ask you to go with me.

52:52.937 --> 52:54.905
I'm sorry, Joe.

53:04.715 --> 53:05.850
Wow.

53:12.156 --> 53:13.724
You're good.

53:15.860 --> 53:17.262
Sniper?

53:22.066 --> 53:24.435
No.

53:25.770 --> 53:27.872
Yeah, you know,
I'm sorry, too.

53:30.708 --> 53:31.709
For everything.

53:34.345 --> 53:38.783
You said once to me that I
might be a different man

53:38.783 --> 53:39.950
if I'd met you sooner.

53:39.950 --> 53:41.286
Please.

53:46.324 --> 53:47.925
Well, I am.

53:51.296 --> 53:52.563
You changed me.

53:56.634 --> 53:58.903
That's why I'm not
the guy in this film.

54:07.978 --> 54:09.747
I'm still glad I met you.

54:19.657 --> 54:20.891
Oh, God.

54:26.331 --> 54:27.932
I don't believe the film.

54:27.932 --> 54:30.401
I don't believe it.

54:33.738 --> 54:35.005
I believe you.

54:42.747 --> 54:43.748
Hey.

54:43.748 --> 54:45.182
No. No!

54:45.182 --> 54:46.351
No! Ed!

54:46.351 --> 54:48.353
Ed, no! No!

54:48.353 --> 54:50.355
I'm here!

54:52.222 --> 54:53.558
I'm here!

54:58.596 --> 55:00.365
Where the fuck are they?

55:00.365 --> 55:01.766
They should be with you.

55:19.116 --> 55:20.385
Shit.

55:20.385 --> 55:21.619
Get out there!

55:29.394 --> 55:30.961
Ah, damn it.

55:36.266 --> 55:37.735
What have you done?

55:52.717 --> 55:55.486
[Woman speaking Japanese]

55:55.486 --> 55:57.488
Hai, sensei!

57:13.531 --> 57:18.102

Get your hot dogs right here.
We got candied apples

57:37.555 --> 57:38.989

Sports announcer:
San Francisco is...

57:40.224 --> 57:41.859
One, please.

57:41.859 --> 57:44.361
All right, son, here you go.

57:44.361 --> 57:45.963
And there goes the runner.

57:45.963 --> 57:49.867
** [rock 'n roll]

57:53.170 --> 57:56.541
And the windup. Here's
the pitch on the way.

57:56.541 --> 57:58.108
That's a good fast ball.

57:58.108 --> 58:00.177
- [bat cracks ball]
- And there goes the runner!

58:00.177 --> 58:02.446
A bouncing ball. Second base
