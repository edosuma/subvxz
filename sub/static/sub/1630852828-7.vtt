NETFLIX
PRESENTS

00:14.960 --> 00:17.480
My cousin says France is torn apart.

00:18.160 --> 00:20.320
Students are burning everything.

00:20.400 --> 00:23.640
-The police are beating everyone up.
-Why did we come this way?

00:23.720 --> 00:26.120
Here. The money
from the fight and the bet.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.200
This is for the pain.

00:29.280 --> 00:31.840
Three cubes and you'll forget
your face is all messed up.

00:32.720 --> 00:34.600
Why did we come through the mountain?

00:40.080 --> 00:42.240
-What was that?
-A boar, for sure.

00:42.720 --> 00:46.040
Damn, Tó! You were always a bad driver!

00:46.120 --> 00:50.080
-Why did we come through the mountain?
-Joaquim!

00:52.760 --> 00:53.760
Joaquim!

00:55.040 --> 00:59.680
Good morning!
Hey, congratulations on that fight.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.120
I heard the Spanish were tough to beat.

01:02.200 --> 01:04.040
At fighting and making tortillas.

01:04.120 --> 01:07.120
Tó! Bastard!

01:13.960 --> 01:14.960
<i>And leave him on foot?</i>

01:15.760 --> 01:18.240
It's my cousin.
He hasn't seen his family in six years.

01:18.320 --> 01:19.600
He crossed half of Spain on foot.

01:19.680 --> 01:23.280
If he hadn't messed with the communists,
he wouldn't have to go to France, right?

01:24.360 --> 01:26.560
Damn, Tó!

01:27.120 --> 01:30.160
It's not enough
that you have two stones for fists,

01:30.240 --> 01:32.160
now you want a heart of stone as well!

01:32.240 --> 01:34.640
You have shit for brains!
What are you going to do now?

01:34.720 --> 01:35.680
-Take it easy.
-What?

01:35.760 --> 01:37.920
I can handle it. Shut up.
Give me the money.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.040
Tell your cousin.

01:39.120 --> 01:41.400
-Zé, be quiet.
-Shut up, Zé.

01:43.120 --> 01:44.280
Don't say a word.

01:46.920 --> 01:48.160
Good afternoon.

01:49.040 --> 01:52.640
Good afternoon.
We found this in the middle of the road.

01:52.720 --> 01:54.560
Maybe it'll be useful to someone.

01:54.640 --> 01:56.840
-I'll check your trunk.
-My trunk?

01:58.440 --> 02:00.480
Don't move. Don't do anything.

02:00.560 --> 02:02.880
Don't do anything! No!

02:02.960 --> 02:04.200
No!

02:04.720 --> 02:08.640
Stop!

02:11.600 --> 02:12.600
Come on!

02:16.680 --> 02:18.920
Get in, Zé! Come in!

02:19.000 --> 02:21.080
Get in, Zé! Quick!

02:22.240 --> 02:27.000
-Damn, Zé. Where's Joaquim?
-I didn't see him.

04:27.720 --> 04:33.120
I think it was the first time
that The Raia Tiger chickened out.

04:34.680 --> 04:38.360
There aren't a lot of people
that can say, like me,

04:38.440 --> 04:41.880
that it was love at first death threat.

04:43.080 --> 04:45.760
No. Eros and Thanatos, Grandpa.

04:46.600 --> 04:49.680
Ladies and gentlemen,
Marco-pedia in action. Clap your hands.

04:49.760 --> 04:53.320
-Go on.
-So Eros was love, the impulse of life.

04:53.400 --> 04:57.400
Thanatos was the impulse of death.
They were inseparable.

04:57.480 --> 05:01.560
People tend to fall in love
in dangerous situations.

05:01.640 --> 05:05.800
Adrenaline is an aphrodisiac.
So that's normal.

05:06.880 --> 05:10.320
-You give me erectile dysfunction.
-Stop that.

05:11.120 --> 05:14.440
The French call the female orgasm
<i>"la petite morte,"</i>

05:14.920 --> 05:17.160
because it is a little death.

05:17.240 --> 05:20.000
Are these appropriate conversations?

05:21.080 --> 05:23.040
It is forbidden to forbid.

05:23.800 --> 05:26.680
Down with the roofs.
The rain belongs to the people!

05:26.760 --> 05:28.440
The table!

05:28.520 --> 05:30.960
I'm leaving.
There's nothing left to learn here.

05:31.040 --> 05:34.960
Join us, comrade,
and the sun will shine on all of us.

05:35.040 --> 05:38.280
Wait, honey. I'll go with you.
I'm a little tired.

05:38.360 --> 05:41.000
Excuse me. Goodbye. See you tomorrow.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.800
I want you home by midnight.

05:47.280 --> 05:48.480
Take care.

05:50.920 --> 05:54.800
-That's for you.
-No, come on.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.880
-Drink.
-Drink up.

06:00.040 --> 06:01.440
To The Raia Tiger.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.360
Straight down the hatch!

06:10.960 --> 06:12.040
How many?

06:14.760 --> 06:16.480
Let's go. Ten euros.

07:07.440 --> 07:09.640
This isn't the first time
I've had a gun pointed at me.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.520
And it may be the last time.

07:11.600 --> 07:14.040
And you'd be a widow before our wedding.

07:26.640 --> 07:27.840
I'm Joaquim.

07:28.760 --> 07:32.600
I'm The Raia Tiger.
The cops are after me.

07:36.320 --> 07:37.160
Tiger?

07:40.160 --> 07:42.200
You look more like a fallen sparrow.

07:52.480 --> 07:57.120
You're tripping, dude.

08:26.240 --> 08:31.240
This is the reading
of Mr. Joaquim Paixão's will.

08:32.760 --> 08:35.200
To quote the testator,

08:36.920 --> 08:40.040
"No priests or churches."

08:43.600 --> 08:48.800
"I want my funeral to be held at the farm.
Everyone should have fun."

08:53.680 --> 08:56.520
-That's it?
-"Everyone should have fun"?

08:56.600 --> 08:58.800
I think Grandpa wanted an Irish funeral.

08:58.880 --> 09:01.200
-What's that?
-The Irish are very religious.

09:01.280 --> 09:05.080
It's a farewell party where the family
and friends have a few drinks.

09:05.760 --> 09:08.440
-That's funny.
-Us, Irish…

09:09.800 --> 09:12.160
-Not funny.
-Of course it is.

09:18.640 --> 09:23.040
Irish, German, Thai.

09:24.280 --> 09:25.840
It doesn't matter.

09:25.920 --> 09:29.600
Let's do what Joaquim wanted.

10:11.400 --> 10:12.680
What do you think?

10:14.120 --> 10:16.360
That's the one Dad wore at my wedding.

10:16.440 --> 10:19.160
Which one? The first,
the second, or the third?

10:30.520 --> 10:34.320
-Not this one. I'd like to keep it.
-Okay.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.640
What do you think about this one?

10:40.720 --> 10:43.720
No, Vanessa. I have an idea.

10:59.360 --> 11:03.120
Natália, this is a funeral.
Not your third wedding.

11:03.200 --> 11:04.520
This makes more sense, right?

11:04.600 --> 11:06.400
-It doesn't make any sense!
-It does!

11:06.480 --> 11:09.240
Shut up. It doesn't make sense. Nonsense!

11:09.320 --> 11:12.520
-And the shoes--
-I'll take care of it.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.640
Vanessa,

11:15.800 --> 11:18.480
for once in your life,
listen to your sister.

11:19.120 --> 11:23.160
Tell the funeral home to dress your father
in his boxing clothes.

11:24.520 --> 11:28.560
Now, if you don't mind,
I'd like to be alone.

11:34.720 --> 11:37.200
THE RAIA TIGER

12:57.520 --> 12:59.160
Your story is off.

13:02.920 --> 13:06.960
Do you know Tó Carrapato?

13:07.920 --> 13:09.520
-The smuggler?
-Right.

13:10.440 --> 13:13.280
Yes. He was married to a cousin of mine.

13:14.040 --> 13:17.880
-He was the one driving the car.
-Are you involved in politics?

13:17.960 --> 13:20.480
No, I don't care about that.

13:21.160 --> 13:23.200
So you have no beliefs.

13:27.200 --> 13:30.800
I've had ten-round fights
less brutal than this.

13:34.240 --> 13:36.080
I need to know who you are

13:36.160 --> 13:38.040
so I can decide
whether to help you or not.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.160
So sit with me.

13:44.080 --> 13:47.600
Have a drink with me,
and I'll tell you about my life.

13:49.640 --> 13:51.000
You won't go far like that.

13:54.240 --> 13:56.120
Do you think this is easy?

13:57.000 --> 14:01.880
Have you ever been covered in bruises,
trying to escape the police

14:01.960 --> 14:06.520
while trying to woo a girl
who's pointing a gun at you?

14:11.120 --> 14:12.880
Someone's coming!

15:18.320 --> 15:19.600
You're still here.

15:21.880 --> 15:25.600
If you didn't mind,
I'd stay for the funeral.

15:32.760 --> 15:35.280
Your son-in-law was a good man.

15:37.160 --> 15:40.240
-My father-in-law.
-Right.

15:50.880 --> 15:55.760
<i>Wait, I've been looking for you.</i>
<i>This is the second galaxy I visited today.</i>

15:57.080 --> 15:59.680
<i>I said it would be better</i>
<i>if you left me alone.</i>

16:00.520 --> 16:02.120
<i>My grandfather is dead.</i>

16:06.240 --> 16:07.240
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

16:26.720 --> 16:28.200
-Marco.
<i>-Wait a minute.</i>

16:28.280 --> 16:30.000
<i>My sister is nagging me.</i>

16:36.240 --> 16:38.760
-Are you there?
-Yes.

16:47.120 --> 16:48.120
Look.

16:50.960 --> 16:55.160
-Were you crying?
-No, it's the goggles.

16:58.920 --> 17:01.320
Grandpa is in the living room.
Want to see him?

17:03.680 --> 17:05.160
I can't.

17:08.640 --> 17:10.480
I need your help.

17:37.600 --> 17:41.080
<i>-Can we get together today?</i>
<i>-Are you sure?</i>

17:41.160 --> 17:44.080
<i>Yes. You have my repentant bear word.</i>

17:48.320 --> 17:49.520
<i>That's Badocha.</i>

17:49.600 --> 17:51.840
<i>Last week he bought</i>
<i>Han Solo's Millennium Falcon,</i>

17:51.920 --> 17:52.920
<i>and now this one.</i>

17:53.000 --> 17:54.880
<i>He was always an exhibitionist.</i>

18:24.520 --> 18:27.520
Faith over fear, Marco.

18:29.680 --> 18:31.640
Virilix won't let you down.

18:37.320 --> 18:39.240
You're tripping, dude.

18:41.200 --> 18:43.640
THE TIGER AND THE RAIA

18:43.720 --> 18:48.280
I don't get it.
Wasn't it The Ray Tiger?

18:48.360 --> 18:50.560
That's not a ray, that's an eel.

18:50.640 --> 18:55.440
"The Raia," space, "Tiger."

18:56.920 --> 18:59.200
"Raia." The Portuguese-Spanish border.

18:59.280 --> 19:01.280
-Easy--
-"The Border Tiger"?

19:01.360 --> 19:02.600
Yes.

19:04.640 --> 19:05.640
Angélica.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.080
I need to speak with you, sis.

20:10.480 --> 20:14.440
Did you get new breasts?
They're bigger. It's amazing.

20:14.520 --> 20:19.080
You got new breasts? Did you have to
make this day about yourself?

20:27.000 --> 20:30.600
You came from nothing
and to nothing you shall return

20:30.680 --> 20:35.360
The Voyager probes went to space in 1977.

20:35.440 --> 20:37.680
Right now,
they're beyond the solar system.

20:38.520 --> 20:41.480
They travel at a speed
of 50,000 kilometers per hour.

20:43.120 --> 20:48.160
They contain information
about life on Earth, like…

20:49.640 --> 20:54.640
pictures of animals,
greetings in different languages…

20:56.720 --> 20:59.520
compositions by Bach,

21:00.600 --> 21:05.000
the sound of those first days of passion

21:05.880 --> 21:11.200
because one of the scientists
had just started dating someone back then.

21:11.280 --> 21:18.160
So she asked him if there was any way

21:18.240 --> 21:23.000
to transform her heartbeat
into a language.

21:28.040 --> 21:32.760
I think it's beautiful
that in an infinite universe

21:33.880 --> 21:39.920
there's an insignificant species
that presents itself to the cosmos

21:41.440 --> 21:43.680
with a passionate heartbeat.

21:47.720 --> 21:53.800
I know I sometimes sound like
a Jehovah's Witness for astrophysics.

22:39.080 --> 22:41.960
It's a shame we didn't get to see
your grandfather's bats.

23:00.320 --> 23:01.960
You can come back tomorrow.

23:26.360 --> 23:30.920
In the grand scheme of things,
it's more natural for one not to exist.

23:32.520 --> 23:38.720
You know, the universe has existed
for nearly 14 billion years.

23:39.280 --> 23:43.680
<i>Homo sapiens,</i> us, less than 200,000 years.

23:44.600 --> 23:47.240
-Around that time.
-True.

23:48.440 --> 23:53.000
-Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
-Exactly.

23:54.400 --> 23:59.160
Yet, you're lucky
to even exist on a formidable planet,

24:00.040 --> 24:04.200
in a country without war,
with a woman that loves you.

24:05.760 --> 24:10.040
Brother, you won the existence lottery.

24:11.880 --> 24:16.160
You have to be grateful for this life.
It's the only one you'll ever have.

24:19.160 --> 24:22.720
Live more, complain less.

24:25.800 --> 24:30.120
Brother, wait. That was too intense.

24:31.160 --> 24:33.120
You're making me depressed.

24:33.200 --> 24:36.600
Be more responsible. You can't just
say those things out of the blue.

24:37.680 --> 24:42.120
But you're right. I'm going to
call my wife and ask her out to dinner.

24:47.440 --> 24:48.680
My condolences.

24:49.720 --> 24:52.920
-My respects.
-Thank you.

25:31.200 --> 25:35.680
Go check on our kids.
They haven't showed up yet.

25:49.080 --> 25:51.080
I've been calling you. What's up?

25:52.000 --> 25:53.840
Now you arrange funerals as well?

25:57.880 --> 25:59.080
What?

26:02.360 --> 26:07.960
I'm going outside
to get a bit of fresh air.

26:08.040 --> 26:09.760
We'll go with you, Mother.

26:09.840 --> 26:13.160
No, you stay, welcome the people.

26:14.600 --> 26:15.600
I'm okay.

26:35.080 --> 26:36.960
You have to help me.
I can't do this alone.

26:37.040 --> 26:39.280
Calm down, I'll go with you.
When my father died--

26:39.360 --> 26:40.520
Take off your clothes.

26:42.480 --> 26:43.800
This is not a good idea.

26:43.880 --> 26:47.320
Aren't you a cop?
Isn't it your job to help people?

26:47.400 --> 26:49.400
I'm here because I'm a cop?

26:49.480 --> 26:53.200
Take off your clothes. Or help me undress.

26:53.280 --> 26:54.320
Help me undress.

27:09.720 --> 27:11.440
Calm down.

27:18.120 --> 27:20.120
Wait. Calm down.

27:21.160 --> 27:22.200
Calm down.

27:41.280 --> 27:45.880
You could help me.
Am I doing something wrong?

27:48.040 --> 27:51.520
I don't know. I've never been with anyone.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.400
Don't be like that.

27:56.120 --> 28:01.440
Losing one's virginity is like
the big bang that created the universe.

28:01.520 --> 28:03.760
At first it seems frightening,

28:03.840 --> 28:06.840
but then it allows
the creation of great things.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.400
You're such a nerd.

28:12.440 --> 28:13.840
And sweet.

28:19.280 --> 28:20.840
But it's more than that.

28:32.760 --> 28:34.360
I'm asexual.

28:38.840 --> 28:40.800
But not aromantic.

28:41.440 --> 28:45.800
I know what asexual means.
But I've never heard of "aromantic."

28:45.880 --> 28:47.160
I mean…

28:50.440 --> 28:53.640
I don't feel sexual desire,

28:55.040 --> 28:58.320
but I'm into people.

28:58.400 --> 29:00.960
Physical contact is just hard.

29:01.040 --> 29:05.840
I like to… like.
I'd really like to like someone, but…

29:07.480 --> 29:13.120
At our age, liking someone
without having sex is like

29:14.440 --> 29:19.960
wanting to reach the moon
while everyone wants to reach Mars.

29:21.520 --> 29:26.680
I'm sorry, I'm not very good
with space analogies.

29:26.760 --> 29:30.360
-I don't know if you got that.
-I did. It wasn't that bad.

29:34.400 --> 29:38.040
You're the first person… I've kissed.

29:41.760 --> 29:44.560
I'm tired of feeling like this.

29:45.960 --> 29:50.520
And I feel like I have to do something
to stop feeling this way.

30:08.560 --> 30:09.640
Yes?

30:10.120 --> 30:14.000
Today is not a good day for that.

30:15.960 --> 30:17.680
Let's take it easy.

30:28.120 --> 30:29.280
May I?

30:35.200 --> 30:36.760
I bought a car dealership.

30:36.840 --> 30:38.920
I need you to take photos of it
for the website.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.800
I can't, I have a funeral to attend.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.440
Tell your wife to deal with that.

30:43.520 --> 30:47.400
Do you think I'll be working
on the day of my father-in-law's funeral?

30:47.480 --> 30:50.320
Dad, this is Filipe. That's my father.

30:50.400 --> 30:52.680
Your mom needs you at the wake.

30:53.200 --> 30:55.000
-Hello, Filipe.
-Hi. How are you?

30:56.120 --> 30:57.960
We've met before, haven't we?

30:58.040 --> 31:00.320
-This car is a mess!
-I don't know.

31:02.800 --> 31:05.280
They don't make them anymore.
Do you want to sell it?

31:05.360 --> 31:08.160
-I can find a collector.
-It's not for sale.

31:08.240 --> 31:12.800
-Really? This is just junk.
-My son and I will renovate it.

31:12.880 --> 31:14.320
We will?

31:14.400 --> 31:17.560
-A thousand euros in cash. Right now.
-It's not for sale.

31:17.640 --> 31:19.600
A thousand euros for this?
No one will buy it.

31:19.680 --> 31:22.320
Daniel, come here.

31:27.800 --> 31:29.280
Take the money.

31:29.360 --> 31:32.640
I can't. This was Joaquim's car.
I won't sell it.

31:34.360 --> 31:37.120
We need the money to pay for the funeral.

31:39.720 --> 31:44.360
If Joaquim was still alive
and you died instead,

31:44.440 --> 31:46.760
don't you think he'd do the same thing?

31:46.840 --> 31:50.920
What? Sell an old pile of junk
to pay for my funeral?

31:51.000 --> 31:52.240
No, son.

31:53.960 --> 31:58.200
Sell your cameras to pay for your funeral.

32:06.720 --> 32:07.880
Rita.

32:10.440 --> 32:11.640
Rita.

32:13.840 --> 32:16.640
My grandparents were married for 50 years.

32:20.280 --> 32:23.560
I've been married for seven and a half,
God only knows.

32:25.200 --> 32:26.880
I'm not saying it's torture.

32:28.680 --> 32:31.840
It's an adventure. An achievement.

32:34.080 --> 32:36.880
You have a very romantic vision
of weddings.

32:37.880 --> 32:39.480
If it's not for love…

32:42.000 --> 32:43.680
why are you married?

32:47.960 --> 32:50.360
I came here with the best of intentions.

32:51.320 --> 32:53.480
In fact, I came because you asked me to.

32:55.080 --> 32:56.200
I know.

32:58.560 --> 33:01.680
Thank you for the shock treatment,
my general.

33:38.240 --> 33:40.360
THE TIGER AND THE RAIA

33:40.440 --> 33:41.880
"The Tiger and the Raia"?

33:43.880 --> 33:45.040
Look there.

34:11.480 --> 34:12.680
Honey.

34:14.040 --> 34:15.280
Don't mind the kids.

34:15.360 --> 34:18.760
Each of them deals with it
in their own way.

34:22.840 --> 34:26.960
-Peculiar family.
-Aren't they all?

35:48.160 --> 35:51.880
Ecstasy. Yeah, bitch.

36:07.680 --> 36:08.600
What's that smell?

36:11.480 --> 36:12.680
Want some?

36:36.240 --> 36:38.760
Dário! Oh, my God!

36:39.600 --> 36:41.880
You're an animal!

36:45.120 --> 36:46.720
So say something.

36:49.160 --> 36:50.360
Congratulations.

36:51.640 --> 36:53.480
Vanessa, you make it sound terrible.

36:54.520 --> 36:58.080
-I'm sorry.
-For real.

36:58.160 --> 37:00.600
I'm sorry. It's not that. I'm sorry.

37:02.600 --> 37:04.680
How can I explain? I feel…

37:05.680 --> 37:10.000
Like I'm in
a tutti-frutti salad of emotions.

37:11.240 --> 37:15.960
Deaths, separations, babies.
All in the blender. Like that.

37:18.320 --> 37:22.520
Don't put my baby in a blender.
That's not good.

37:27.880 --> 37:31.000
-I'm going to be an aunt!
-Yeah!

37:35.200 --> 37:36.080
Yes?

37:36.880 --> 37:39.880
-Be quiet.
-Mommy…

37:41.480 --> 37:44.240
So good. Hot milk and honey.

37:48.000 --> 37:51.160
-Mom, you know there was no need.
-Of course there was.

37:51.240 --> 37:53.120
When Daniel dies,

37:53.200 --> 37:56.440
don't forget to give
milk and honey to your kids.

37:59.520 --> 38:02.280
And you don't have to pretend to like it.

38:02.360 --> 38:05.360
Your father covered for you.

38:05.440 --> 38:09.840
He would flush the toilet so many times

38:09.920 --> 38:12.640
after you threw the milk into it.

38:12.720 --> 38:15.240
-You knew?
-Look, sweetheart.

38:16.840 --> 38:20.240
I'm kind of old now.

38:22.240 --> 38:23.520
But I was never dumb.

38:27.880 --> 38:31.120
Mom, if you knew
that we'd throw the milk away,

38:31.200 --> 38:33.000
why did you keep bringing it?

38:33.600 --> 38:36.000
Because if not me, who else would?

38:48.760 --> 38:50.320
You're a great cook.

38:51.680 --> 38:56.200
Those pears only come around
once in a while. Yellow, like the sun.

38:56.280 --> 38:58.040
I've never eaten a pear.

38:58.600 --> 39:00.640
The ground here is not so good.

39:00.720 --> 39:02.600
A few apples, at the most. Right?

39:03.480 --> 39:04.840
You're not "pear"-y lucky.

39:08.560 --> 39:11.720
I hope you're better at boxing
than you are with puns.

39:16.920 --> 39:21.880
-Where did you learn to cook?
-Alone. I had to. I liked to.

39:22.600 --> 39:25.240
One day, I'll have a restaurant.

39:26.760 --> 39:29.800
-Around here? Not a great idea.
-Not here.

39:29.880 --> 39:32.040
I'm saving money to go to Lisbon.

39:34.800 --> 39:36.200
Do you have family?

39:36.800 --> 39:39.240
My father and my brother live in Paris.

39:40.400 --> 39:41.720
And your mother?

39:47.000 --> 39:50.320
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

39:51.400 --> 39:52.600
I'm sorry.

40:03.840 --> 40:08.760
I think it's time for you to go.

40:13.680 --> 40:17.440
-Of course.
-Wait a minute.

40:52.240 --> 40:56.040
They were my dad's. Maybe they'll fit you.

41:43.600 --> 41:47.240
<i>Those games you played with me.</i>

41:48.400 --> 41:53.040
They say that grief
makes everything blurry,

41:54.120 --> 41:57.480
lifeless and without color.

41:59.040 --> 42:00.800
To me, it's the opposite.

42:01.800 --> 42:05.320
I can't remember
the last time I was so lucid.

42:07.720 --> 42:11.800
I don't remember much anyway, right?

42:15.200 --> 42:16.280
Joaquim,

42:18.280 --> 42:20.880
my mind will get worse.

42:25.280 --> 42:26.880
What if I forget about you?

42:28.680 --> 42:30.480
What if I forget about us?

42:36.000 --> 42:38.800
What did our grandson say?

42:42.720 --> 42:46.560
Love… and death.

44:55.240 --> 44:59.640
Men don't cry, dude!

45:24.360 --> 45:26.280
<i>Not this</i>

45:27.520 --> 45:29.320
<i>I don't like it</i>

45:30.160 --> 45:31.560
It's this one here.

45:36.400 --> 45:37.680
What did I do?

45:37.760 --> 45:41.440
We have to be careful
while transporting it. I can't ruin…

45:41.520 --> 45:44.200
It's all for show.
We paint it and that's it.

45:44.280 --> 45:47.120
You put a pallet under there to lift it.

45:47.200 --> 45:52.080
This part here we might have to
disassemble so this doesn't get damaged,

45:52.160 --> 45:54.000
then we can put it back together
with some glue.

46:27.360 --> 46:28.560
I'm late.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.280
But I brought company.

46:35.120 --> 46:39.400
Tó Carrapato, give me a hug.

46:41.840 --> 46:45.440
My God, it's been so long.

46:46.560 --> 46:50.400
-Have you eaten something?
-I had a sandwich.

46:50.480 --> 46:52.720
Just that? You must be starving.

46:52.800 --> 46:55.080
Come. Today you'll eat
with the Paixão family.

47:15.720 --> 47:16.720
What time is it?

47:18.600 --> 47:19.720
7:30.

47:22.520 --> 47:26.120
-Does anyone want to have breakfast?
-7:30 p.m.

47:38.680 --> 47:40.640
Come on. Don't be sad.

47:42.040 --> 47:45.920
I'll restore this pile of junk
and sell it to one of those dumb guys

47:46.000 --> 47:48.320
who pay for anything
just because it's vintage.

47:49.440 --> 47:51.000
It is vintage.

48:00.320 --> 48:03.040
Hey, come on, man.

48:03.880 --> 48:07.840
Men don't cry, dude! Come on.
I don't like seeing you like this.

48:07.920 --> 48:11.080
Chin up, chest out, belly in.

48:11.160 --> 48:12.320
I'll call you for the photos--

48:15.640 --> 48:18.600
Never take your eyes off the Tiger, dude.

48:25.960 --> 48:27.120
Can you give me a ride?

48:30.520 --> 48:32.680
Do I know you from somewhere?

48:33.440 --> 48:34.840
Your fly is open.

48:41.320 --> 48:45.000
-Do we toast?
-Okay.

48:48.040 --> 48:50.480
-And your eyes.
-Bring it on.

48:52.480 --> 48:53.800
Do we toast?

48:53.880 --> 48:55.160
-Yes.
-Of course…

48:55.240 --> 48:57.000
Every year--

48:57.080 --> 48:58.880
-Just a little bit.
-Is that good?

48:59.440 --> 49:02.400
Every year I'd send him
one of these bottles for Christmas.

49:04.160 --> 49:07.360
Every year without fail since 1968.

49:09.360 --> 49:10.200
Let's do it.

49:10.960 --> 49:12.440
Okay then.

49:14.000 --> 49:15.160
To The Raia Tiger.

49:15.240 --> 49:17.200
-To The Raia Tiger!
-To The Raia Tiger!

49:17.280 --> 49:19.960
No more lighthouse keepers for Berlengas!

49:20.040 --> 49:23.480
-No more lighthouse keepers for Berlengas!
-No more!

49:28.120 --> 49:29.520
I told you so.

49:29.600 --> 49:31.920
Give her a pat.

49:33.080 --> 49:35.080
-I told you so.
-This is very strong.

53:52.400 --> 53:54.480
Are you sure they're the right size?

53:57.040 --> 54:02.640
-They seem a little tight.
-You're so grumpy.

54:04.200 --> 54:06.400
You were funnier when we first met.

54:20.200 --> 54:22.160
<i>Do you want to hear a funny story?</i>

54:24.760 --> 54:25.880
<i>Here it goes.</i>

54:27.400 --> 54:33.240
<i>Once upon a time, there was a sparrow</i>
<i>that fell out of his nest.</i>

54:35.520 --> 54:37.520
<i>He thought he was a tiger.</i>
