WEBVTT

00:02.969 --> 00:04.448
It's my new
interview outfit.

00:04.504 --> 00:07.007
Like, "Hey, nice to meet you.
Can't wait for the interview."

00:07.073 --> 00:10.213
Um, maybe the hat?
Yeah.

00:10.276 --> 00:11.277
Lose this?

00:11.344 --> 00:14.450
To win an election, you have to
be good and you have to be lucky.

00:14.614 --> 00:17.823
Buddy Wood hosts the number one
morning show in Indianapolis.

00:17.884 --> 00:21.331
And he wants to interview me for a
series he's doing on local elections.

00:22.122 --> 00:24.568
And last year, the five people
that he profiled, all won.

00:24.624 --> 00:26.160
This is a
huge break for us.

00:27.794 --> 00:30.775
Hey. Maybe we should put a
pause on the fashion show.

00:30.830 --> 00:32.332
We have to go over
your talking points.

00:32.399 --> 00:34.345
Keep going.
I can still hear you.

00:34.734 --> 00:37.010
Okay. Ms. Knope,
what is going to be

00:37.137 --> 00:39.413
your first major
public works project?

00:39.472 --> 00:40.917
Oh, I don't know.

00:40.974 --> 00:43.648
But I bet these pants
will work for the public.

00:44.110 --> 00:45.987
Damn.
Those pants look dope.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.083
Right? Oh, my God.
Those look great.

00:48.148 --> 00:50.628
And I bet they'd look even
better on Ben's floor.

00:50.683 --> 00:52.720
Are you hitting
on Leslie for me?

00:52.786 --> 00:54.060
Wait a second.
Just turn around?

00:54.187 --> 00:55.461
What?

00:56.689 --> 00:57.690
Oh.

00:57.957 --> 01:00.597
It says "nympho" on the butt
in silver sparkly letters.

01:00.660 --> 01:02.162
"Nympho" means
you're addicted to sex.

01:02.228 --> 01:04.605
And since it's on the butt, there's
other implications as well.

01:05.632 --> 01:07.043
So, those are
a maybe.

01:27.620 --> 01:29.827
Who was Laura Mulvey?

01:29.956 --> 01:31.299
Laura Mulvey

01:31.357 --> 01:33.496
Girl
was a guy.

01:33.693 --> 01:36.537
Right. Women's Studies.
They're all girls.

01:36.763 --> 01:39.869
Laura Mulvey was a feminist film
critic who wrote a major essay

01:39.933 --> 01:43.471
that helped shift the
orientation of film theory

01:43.536 --> 01:45.379
to the psychoanalytical
framework.

01:45.572 --> 01:46.983
Treat, please.

01:47.040 --> 01:50.214
I'm about to take my first ever
final for my women's studies class.

01:50.276 --> 01:52.017
Usually,
tests scare me.

01:52.078 --> 01:54.080
But this is
an oral exam.

01:54.781 --> 01:57.455
And if there's
one thing I know is

01:58.418 --> 02:00.523
my fantastic,
it's talk.

02:01.554 --> 02:03.500
God, I don't know.
Man, I'm so nervous.

02:03.623 --> 02:05.330
I know. I'm just going
to call the professor.

02:05.391 --> 02:06.392
And then, I'm going
to get on the phone

02:06.459 --> 02:07.938
and make some
fake barfing sounds.

02:07.994 --> 02:09.632
And then, I'm just going to bail.
So, give me my phone.

02:09.696 --> 02:13.803
No, Andrew. That's not how
grownups handle tough situations.

02:13.867 --> 02:16.404
Well, I... We face
our fears head-on.

02:16.836 --> 02:18.406
I told you. If you can't
remember what some woman did,

02:18.471 --> 02:20.712
just tear up and say,
"She changed my life."

02:21.508 --> 02:23.181
Yeah.
That's a good call.

02:23.910 --> 02:26.117
I think this is it.
But do I need a hat?

02:26.179 --> 02:28.523
Like a bowler
or an edgy scarf?

02:28.581 --> 02:31.425
No. Those endless scarves that come
out of your sleeves like a magician.

02:32.819 --> 02:34.264
Um, I think you should just
go with something basic.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.425
Just no-nonsense.

02:36.589 --> 02:38.091
Mr. Wood, hello.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.866
God, he is more
tightly wound than ever.

02:40.927 --> 02:42.998
Maybe we should see if he can
pull that rod out of his butt

02:43.062 --> 02:45.565
and we can hang some
of those outfits on it.

02:45.632 --> 02:49.307
Ann and I have the occasional
rough patch in our relationship.

02:49.369 --> 02:52.111
But right now, we're
really in a groove.

02:52.305 --> 02:54.717
We've gone 30 hours
without breaking up.

02:54.774 --> 02:57.015
Our personal best
is 47 hours.

02:57.477 --> 02:59.479
It happened when she was
out of town for two days

02:59.546 --> 03:01.651
and she forgot
we were dating.

03:01.748 --> 03:04.922
Well, let me know if anything changes.
Thank you.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.194
Interview's off.
What?

03:08.288 --> 03:10.290
What? Buddy has to fly back
to Indianapolis early.

03:10.356 --> 03:12.302
Something about
a factory explosion.

03:12.358 --> 03:14.201
Come on. Did anyone
even get hurt?

03:14.260 --> 03:15.534
Sorry.

03:15.595 --> 03:17.802
First stroke of luck
we've had and it's gone.

03:18.531 --> 03:20.306
Okay. Well, we just
have to work harder.

03:20.366 --> 03:22.243
I mean, good news is
we can call it a night

03:22.302 --> 03:24.407
and get a super early start
on our door-to-door tomorrow.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.115
Ooh, that is
great news.

03:26.172 --> 03:27.845
And you know,
we might even be able

03:27.907 --> 03:29.511
to make it back in time
for Boring Club.

03:29.576 --> 03:31.112
Do you know who the President
of Boring Club is?

03:32.078 --> 03:33.318
Me?
No.

03:33.546 --> 03:35.617
You lost the election because
your speech was too boring.

03:35.682 --> 03:37.684
Hey. Why don't we
all go get a drink?

03:37.750 --> 03:40.822
Blow off some steam. Everybody's
been working so hard.

03:40.920 --> 03:43.526
Um, well, we're in
the home stretch here,

03:43.656 --> 03:45.294
and losing that
interview didn't help.

03:45.959 --> 03:48.371
I'm going to go over some polling
numbers and turn in early.

03:48.428 --> 03:49.566
I suggest you
do the same.

03:49.629 --> 03:51.973
Hey, Leslie.
Give you a ride home?

03:52.031 --> 03:55.638
Screw it. I've got a new
outfit, my hair looks amazing,

03:55.902 --> 03:58.781
and I have a serious excess
of pre-interview adrenaline.

03:58.838 --> 03:59.839
Who's gonna
drink with me?

03:59.906 --> 04:01.408
Ooh.
Ooh!

04:02.008 --> 04:06.388
Susan Bronwell or B. Anthony was born
in Adams, Massachusetts, in 1820.

04:06.446 --> 04:09.655
And she played a pivotal role in the
institution of women's suffrage.

04:09.716 --> 04:10.922
Andy.
Treat, please.

04:11.017 --> 04:13.258
Andy. Slow down. You're
taking this class pass-fail.

04:13.886 --> 04:16.798
So, I'm just looking for a free-wheeling
discussion about, you know,

04:16.856 --> 04:18.130
what you got
from the class.

04:18.358 --> 04:20.201
Oh, okay.

04:20.560 --> 04:23.598
I would say
what I find very cool

04:23.663 --> 04:26.200
about Susan B. Anthony is

04:29.168 --> 04:33.639
how she was born in Adams,
Massachusetts in 1820.

04:34.807 --> 04:37.219
You know?
Just one man's opinion.

04:37.644 --> 04:39.521
I passed! I got a P!

04:39.579 --> 04:41.525
Congrats, babe.
Yeah.

04:41.614 --> 04:44.891
I was hoping for a P plus
but that does not exist.

04:45.385 --> 04:46.489
Right?
Right.

04:46.552 --> 04:48.293
Yes. So basically,
best grade in the class.

04:48.421 --> 04:50.196
Tied for the best grade
in the class.

04:50.523 --> 04:53.231
Ron, I am a college graduate now.
No, you're not.

04:53.326 --> 04:55.328
I'm a college
course graduate.

04:55.461 --> 04:56.804
And it's all
because of you.

04:56.929 --> 04:58.272
It's my pleasure, son.

04:58.331 --> 04:59.776
I'm really
proud of you.

04:59.832 --> 05:01.505
How about a steak?
Yeah!

05:01.567 --> 05:02.773
Well, you guys
have a good time.

05:02.835 --> 05:04.439
Professor, why don't
you come with us?

05:04.504 --> 05:05.505
Is that cool?
Sure.

05:05.571 --> 05:08.950
We'll let you pay for your own
food because of equality.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.986
I guess now that the class is over,
there's nothing wrong with it.

05:12.478 --> 05:13.684
Are you going to
wear that?

05:15.014 --> 05:18.962
Okay, I'm calling it. I have
a date with my bathtub,

05:19.352 --> 05:23.198
a glass of red wine and a
gigantic fireman named Marcus.

05:23.790 --> 05:25.827
I'm going to keep
plugging away for a bit.

05:28.494 --> 05:29.837
You don't mind
this work, do you?

05:29.929 --> 05:30.930
Uh-uh.

05:31.030 --> 05:32.407
I like it.

05:34.867 --> 05:36.540
It makes sense to me.

05:40.006 --> 05:41.007
Mmm.

05:41.207 --> 05:43.710
This was such a good idea.
Should we get another round?

05:44.744 --> 05:48.157
Um, I think we should get a more
basic, no-nonsense beverage.

05:48.214 --> 05:49.215
Hey.

05:50.116 --> 05:52.357
Maybe we should all just drink
sensible portions of milk.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.225
I love him.

05:54.287 --> 05:58.497
It's just, this campaign
has turned fun, dorky Ben

05:58.558 --> 06:01.562
into grumpy stress-ball Ben.
Hmm.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.607
It's like dealing
with a strict mother

06:04.664 --> 06:08.043
who I am confusingly
attracted to.

06:08.334 --> 06:10.211
Hmm.
Ben is like a MILF.

06:10.269 --> 06:11.942
You just need to
blow off some steam.

06:12.004 --> 06:13.483
And he should just get that.
Yeah.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.212
You're Leslie Knope.
Right. That's...

06:15.274 --> 06:17.276
No one takes this more
seriously than you do.

06:17.343 --> 06:18.617
Totally.
Tell me about it!

06:18.678 --> 06:19.713
Yes!

06:19.779 --> 06:20.849
Tequila shots?
No!

06:20.913 --> 06:22.017
Nice!

06:22.081 --> 06:23.924
To Knope 2012.

06:25.818 --> 06:26.819
Ahh.

06:26.953 --> 06:28.023
Ding-dong.

06:29.589 --> 06:31.967
Hello, Lady Knope.
I mean, Leslie Knope.

06:32.024 --> 06:33.901
Hey.
Oh. Hey, Ben.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.733
Where are you?

06:35.862 --> 06:37.569
I am in the house,
watching TV right now.

06:37.630 --> 06:39.132
I'm watching...
Murder, She Wrote.

06:39.198 --> 06:41.678
Murder, She Wrote. I'm
watching Murder, She Wrote.

06:41.734 --> 06:44.305
Amazing news. Buddy Wood's
flight was delayed.

06:44.370 --> 06:47.317
So, if we can get to the airport
right now, the interview is back on.

06:47.373 --> 06:49.011
What? Wow.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.078
What could be
wrong with that?

06:52.145 --> 06:55.285
Nothing. Anyway, here comes me.
See you at the airport.

06:55.348 --> 06:57.954
Great. I'll see you
there as soon as possible.

06:58.017 --> 06:59.121
Okay, We-

06:59.185 --> 07:00.289
The interview is back on.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.558
Whoo! Yes!

07:01.621 --> 07:04.500
I know. We are so drucky.
I mean lunky.

07:10.496 --> 07:13.033
Okay. Both the cabs
in this town are busy,

07:13.099 --> 07:15.602
but I still have
eight hours of rental time

07:15.668 --> 07:17.147
on that hot tub
limousine that I got

07:17.270 --> 07:18.772
for your campaign event
and it's on its way.

07:18.838 --> 07:20.943
That's smart.
You're smart.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.777
Diddly-diddly,
diddly-diddly, swag.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.120
You did it right!
I did it right!

07:27.780 --> 07:29.453
Thirty-three hours.

07:29.515 --> 07:32.257
Okay, look. This interview
is a big deal, you guys.

07:32.318 --> 07:34.457
This is a game changer. Okay?
I have to do well.

07:34.587 --> 07:36.897
Listen. Let's do
a practice interview.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.663
Big idea, Ann.
And see how you do.

07:38.724 --> 07:39.998
Let's go.

07:40.593 --> 07:44.507
Leslie,
in your humble opinion... What?

07:44.564 --> 07:45.838
Why are you
from Russia?

07:45.965 --> 07:47.239
I don't know.

07:48.234 --> 07:50.407
Hey, Ron is the guy
l wrote about

07:50.536 --> 07:52.743
for that paper on
positive male role models.

07:53.239 --> 07:55.685
Oh, yeah. That was one of
your most readable papers.

07:56.242 --> 07:58.848
According to Andy,
you're quite the feminist.

07:58.911 --> 08:00.982
I don't consider
myself an anything-ist,

08:01.047 --> 08:03.755
but my life has been shaped
by powerful women.

08:03.883 --> 08:08.354
My father once told my mother that
woman was made from the rib of Adam

08:08.421 --> 08:10.264
and my mom broke his jaw.

08:10.523 --> 08:11.695
My Uncle Lon
once tried to...

08:11.757 --> 08:13.236
Is that Chris?

08:13.359 --> 08:14.861
Yeah, it really
looks like him.

08:15.428 --> 08:19.399
But there's no way to know for sure.
We should ask him tomorrow.

08:20.566 --> 08:21.874
Hey.

08:22.001 --> 08:23.309
April Ludgate.

08:23.369 --> 08:25.076
Why are you here,
eating alone?

08:25.204 --> 08:29.152
I'm not. I'm surrounded by friends.
Friends I don't know yet.

08:29.442 --> 08:31.752
And I'm engrossed
in this book.

08:32.010 --> 08:35.754
It's the true story of a woman
born with no arms and no legs

08:35.847 --> 08:37.452
who attempted to swim
the English Channel.

08:37.549 --> 08:38.789
That's impossible.

08:38.851 --> 08:40.421
Oh, she drowned
immediately.

08:40.486 --> 08:41.658
It's kind of
a sad story.

08:41.953 --> 08:43.058
Cool.

08:43.722 --> 08:47.830
I'm over there with people you actually
know, if you want to come join us.

08:48.427 --> 08:49.770
Thank you.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.036
Bye, friend.
Bye.

08:57.403 --> 08:59.405
I'm sorry, Marcus. I'm
going to have to cancel our bath.

08:59.839 --> 09:02.911
Something interesting is happening.
I'm going to watch it.

09:02.975 --> 09:04.921
I don't know, Marcus. I'll hit
you up when I hit you up.

09:16.155 --> 09:18.101
Wow. I feel totally normal.
I'm ready to do this.

09:18.257 --> 09:20.931
Thank you for accommodating
us on such short notice.

09:20.993 --> 09:23.132
Hey. For Leslie Knope? Anytime.

09:23.195 --> 09:24.731
Just let me know if you need
anything else, all right?

09:24.797 --> 09:26.834
Thanks, Paul. Hey, you
got those new ID badges.

09:27.466 --> 09:28.570
They finally
upgraded us.

09:28.634 --> 09:29.635
Security swipe
and everything.

09:29.769 --> 09:30.804
Look at that.

09:30.870 --> 09:32.076
Sorry.
Yeah.

09:32.171 --> 09:33.548
Hey, thanks again
for fighting for them.

09:33.606 --> 09:35.210
Helpy to hop out.

09:35.308 --> 09:36.514
Leslie Knope.
Buddy Wood.

09:36.642 --> 09:37.882
Buddy Wood.

09:37.944 --> 09:39.787
Glad you could make it.
Glad you could make it.

09:39.879 --> 09:41.552
Thank you so
much for being here,

09:41.681 --> 09:43.354
and welcome to the
greatest city in the world.

09:45.318 --> 09:46.490
Oh, I'm sorry.
You were being serious.

09:47.053 --> 09:48.054
We're setting up
over there.

09:48.120 --> 09:51.294
Found a small piece of carpet
without a horrifying smellscape.

09:51.357 --> 09:52.961
I'll be right there.

09:53.025 --> 09:54.595
Hey, do I seem
normal to you?

09:54.660 --> 09:56.503
Like, does everything seem fine?
Yeah, yeah. You seem fine.

09:56.562 --> 09:57.563
I seem okay?
Uh-huh.

09:57.630 --> 09:59.667
I don't seem distracted
or babbly or anything?

09:59.732 --> 10:01.473
No, it's great. So,
you're going to do great.

10:01.534 --> 10:03.912
You're going to do smart.
What's that?

10:04.236 --> 10:05.715
Look who I found.
Hey.

10:05.771 --> 10:07.717
Professor Linda, this is
Chris. Chris, this is...

10:07.840 --> 10:10.446
Professor Linda, it is a
genuine pleasure to meet you.

10:10.509 --> 10:11.510
Oh.You as well.

10:11.577 --> 10:13.215
Hi, there. Would you like
to hear our specials?

10:13.279 --> 10:15.919
No need. Porterhouse,
rare, quickly.

10:15.982 --> 10:16.983
Same.

10:17.049 --> 10:20.292
I'll have the spinach salad. What
kind of dressings do you have?

10:20.453 --> 10:23.059
Oh. Linda, in case you're interested,
I brought my own dressing.

10:23.522 --> 10:24.694
You really
can't be doing that.

10:24.757 --> 10:26.259
Look, this is the last time.
I promise.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.336
It contains
extra virgin olive oil,

10:28.461 --> 10:30.338
a little bit of lemon
and a hint of turmeric.

10:30.596 --> 10:32.075
Sounds great.

10:34.800 --> 10:38.475
Pawnee, Indiana. Home to the
Sweetums Candy Corporation,

10:38.571 --> 10:41.780
nineteen toxic waste
repositories and not much else,

10:41.841 --> 10:43.718
this sleepy mini-metropolis
is the site

10:43.843 --> 10:45.720
of a fascinating
City Council race.

10:45.811 --> 10:48.417
Joining us today is one of the
candidates, Leslie Knope.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.586
Leslie,
welcome to Good Morning.

10:50.650 --> 10:51.958
It's my pleasure.

10:52.818 --> 10:54.024
Thank you for
being on my show.

10:55.421 --> 10:57.924
Leslie, we're here at the
Pawnee Municipal Airport,

10:57.990 --> 11:01.631
which, I must add,
is rather decrepit.

11:01.694 --> 11:03.833
Well, I'm glad
you mentioned it.

11:03.896 --> 11:06.376
It is in desperate
need of refurbishments,

11:06.432 --> 11:10.175
and that is why I am going to make
it a centerpiece of my platform.

11:10.236 --> 11:11.738
Okay.

11:11.871 --> 11:13.373
Take Joe Appledemas
over there.

11:13.439 --> 11:15.282
Hello.
Joe, say hi.

11:15.808 --> 11:17.719
Joe has been
working here since 1996

11:17.843 --> 11:19.789
and his salary has not
been raised a nickel.

11:19.845 --> 11:21.518
I am going to work
very hard to change...

11:21.580 --> 11:25.187
Okay. This airport seems,
to me, like a metaphor.

11:25.785 --> 11:27.196
Are you familiar
with the term?

11:27.319 --> 11:30.061
Pawnee's airport is
symbolic of the town.

11:30.156 --> 11:32.864
Out of touch.
Out of date, perhaps.

11:33.159 --> 11:36.402
Lost, insignificant
and sad.

11:37.863 --> 11:38.864
Your thoughts.

11:39.732 --> 11:42.645
Well, granted, we don't
have big city amenities.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.409
But I think we more
than make up for it

11:44.537 --> 11:46.278
with friendly faces
and hand-working hards.

11:46.338 --> 11:47.612
Hard-working hands.

11:47.673 --> 11:49.914
If you say so. I say it's sad.
Moving on.

11:51.477 --> 11:54.788
Oh, my God.
If they got together,

11:54.847 --> 11:56.793
they would make the most
beautiful super-baby.

11:57.016 --> 11:58.825
It would rule us all.

11:59.685 --> 12:02.529
But what if super baby
became too powerful?

12:02.922 --> 12:04.833
I guess we'll just have
to take that chance.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.927
Chris got dumped
by Jerry's daughter.

12:07.226 --> 12:08.728
He needs this.

12:09.395 --> 12:12.342
Plus, if they get married he'll
spend all his time with her

12:12.398 --> 12:15.345
and I might never have
to talk to him again.

12:16.135 --> 12:17.136
Hmm.

12:17.436 --> 12:20.906
Professor Linda, you
have really nice arms.

12:21.807 --> 12:22.945
Do you work out?

12:23.075 --> 12:24.247
I was going to say
the exact same thing.

12:24.310 --> 12:26.312
But I didn't want
you to think that

12:26.445 --> 12:28.447
I was objectifying
you with my male gaze.

12:28.514 --> 12:30.323
May I see?
Oh, sure.

12:30.783 --> 12:31.784
Oh, my good gracious.

12:31.851 --> 12:34.058
You have extraordinary
caput laterale.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.155
Thank you.

12:35.221 --> 12:37.531
There is nothing more important
than physical health.

12:37.656 --> 12:38.726
I agree.

12:38.791 --> 12:39.895
Kendra.
Yes.

12:39.959 --> 12:42.667
You know what? I am going to
have that third steak after all.

12:42.728 --> 12:45.538
Go ahead and put that order in now.
Please and thank you.

12:45.598 --> 12:48.044
Your campaign hit a snag of
sorts with the revelation

12:48.100 --> 12:49.977
that you and your boss,
Ben Wyatt,

12:50.102 --> 12:52.013
were having
une affaire de coeur.

12:52.071 --> 12:53.175
Affair of the heart.

12:53.239 --> 12:54.650
Well, I've discussed
that many times,

12:54.774 --> 12:56.185
and there's really
nothing more to say.

12:56.242 --> 12:58.188
I would rather
talk about the ways

12:58.310 --> 13:00.256
to solve problems
in this town.

13:00.412 --> 13:01.413
Good luck with that.

13:01.480 --> 13:02.959
But getting back to your
affair with Ben Wyatt,

13:03.015 --> 13:04.460
who's now your
campaign manager...

13:04.517 --> 13:05.860
Buddy, frankly, I don't
want to discuss that.

13:05.918 --> 13:09.456
But if you'd like, we can talk about
ways that I can improve the airport

13:09.522 --> 13:11.001
or our many
wonderful parks.

13:11.056 --> 13:13.434
I don't. I'd like to talk
about you and Ben Wyatt.

13:14.693 --> 13:15.797
Uh-oh.
I know that look.

13:15.861 --> 13:17.169
She's got the crazy eyes.

13:17.229 --> 13:19.971
Well, like I said, I don't
want to discuss it, Buddy.

13:20.032 --> 13:22.376
And frankly, I don't appreciate
your condescending tone.

13:22.434 --> 13:24.971
But you know what? I've had a
couple of drinks, so what the hell.

13:25.037 --> 13:26.482
Ben and I first...

13:26.872 --> 13:30.251
I'm sorry. Ms. Knope,
are you inebriated?

13:30.309 --> 13:34.223
What? No. Preposterous.
Are you inebriated?

13:35.047 --> 13:36.185
That was bad timing.

13:36.248 --> 13:37.852
This is a Buddy Wood first.

13:37.917 --> 13:40.625
An exclusive interview with potential
City Councilwoman Leslie Knope,

13:40.686 --> 13:42.666
who appears to be drunk
right now on camera.

13:42.721 --> 13:44.223
I am not drunk.

13:44.290 --> 13:46.668
Yes, when you have
a jumbo margarita

13:46.725 --> 13:49.069
and some flaming tequila
shots, you can get drunk.

13:49.161 --> 13:52.768
Is it this sad, pathetic town
that makes you drink this way?

13:53.799 --> 13:54.903
This interview is over.

13:55.034 --> 13:56.172
Okay. Ms. Knope.

13:57.970 --> 14:01.747
This is not because I'm drunk.
This is because of the wires.

14:02.374 --> 14:04.513
A fitting end to
a bizarre interview

14:04.577 --> 14:08.320
and a sad moment in a
depressing city with no hope,

14:08.848 --> 14:11.624
in the waning moments
of the bitter saga

14:12.351 --> 14:15.491
that has been
a contentious campaign.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.670
Come on, Buddy
You cannot air that tape.

14:19.725 --> 14:20.760
Are you kidding?

14:20.826 --> 14:23.636
This is as great for me
as it is terrible for you.

14:24.063 --> 14:27.567
The sheep that watch my show are
going to eat this up like tiramisu.

14:27.633 --> 14:28.941
Tiramisu is
an Italian dessert...

14:29.068 --> 14:30.376
I know what
tiramisu is, okay.

14:30.436 --> 14:31.540
And sheep
don't eat it.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.811
Sorry, but
tomorrow morning,

14:34.206 --> 14:38.382
this gets broadcast around
the entire Indiana-sphere.

14:42.047 --> 14:47.258
Thank you for celebrating the
most ultimate triumph of my life.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.596
I am very proud of me.

14:51.357 --> 14:52.461
And you are, too.

14:53.025 --> 14:55.631
And, Professor, I'm taking
your class again next semester

14:55.694 --> 14:57.298
and I'm going to
lock down that P plus.

14:57.363 --> 14:58.842
It's impossible.

14:59.164 --> 15:01.576
You and the women taught me
that nothing is impossible.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.079
I better be going.
I have to get up early.

15:03.135 --> 15:04.136
Goodbye.

15:04.203 --> 15:06.581
I'm teaching a morning
Zumba class for retirees.

15:09.041 --> 15:12.511
Before I do, Linda, do
you enjoy land kayaking?

15:12.578 --> 15:15.787
It's quite fun. Well, it's
more grueling than fun.

15:15.981 --> 15:17.619
But I would love
to take you.

15:17.683 --> 15:20.391
I'm really flattered, but I
just got out of a relationship,

15:20.452 --> 15:23.899
and I think I need a little more
time before I jump into anything.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.494
Of course. I understand.
I'm sorry.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.765
I appreciate your caution.
Thank you.

15:28.827 --> 15:30.170
I hope to see
you again.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.108
Goodbye, everyone.

15:32.164 --> 15:35.077
Anybody want to go to J.J.'s
for some after-dinner omelets?

15:36.769 --> 15:38.510
Or how about you and I
go back to my place?

15:38.871 --> 15:39.941
Yes.

15:43.309 --> 15:44.379
Wow!

15:45.511 --> 15:47.889
Ben, I am so sorry.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.620
Let's just focus
on the problem.

15:49.882 --> 15:52.294
Now, if we don't stop that interview
from airing in the morning,

15:52.351 --> 15:53.659
this campaign is dead.

15:53.719 --> 15:56.700
So, we have to go
to Indianapolis.

15:56.755 --> 15:57.790
And do what?

15:57.923 --> 15:58.958
I don't know, Tom.

15:59.024 --> 16:00.970
I guess we'll just set fire
to the studio or something.

16:01.026 --> 16:02.835
That's so sweet.
I've never had a boyfriend

16:02.895 --> 16:04.670
threaten to commit
arson for me before.

16:04.730 --> 16:05.902
Uh, it gets old.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.741
We still have six hours rental
time on the hot tub limo.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.906
We could take that. No one
will have to drive all night.

16:11.403 --> 16:12.473
That's actually
a good idea.

16:12.538 --> 16:16.611
Plus, it allows for the possibility
of high-speed skinny dipping.

16:18.477 --> 16:20.684
Ann, I was joking.
Come on. It was a joke.

16:20.779 --> 16:22.690
Oh, okay, that's funny.

16:23.582 --> 16:26.085
Where are we going, folks? Drive
around, hit the strip clubs?

16:26.151 --> 16:27.494
Yeah!
No.

16:27.553 --> 16:31.399
We're going to this
address in Indianapolis.

16:31.457 --> 16:33.334
Really?
Yeah.

16:33.625 --> 16:36.834
You know, no one's ever used this hot
tub limo for actual transportation.

16:36.895 --> 16:38.238
I can't take this thing
on the highway,

16:38.364 --> 16:39.741
so it will take
a few extra hours.

16:41.300 --> 16:42.745
Hey, is this a seven or a one?

16:48.607 --> 16:49.779
Jerry.

16:50.109 --> 16:51.281
Jerry.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.783
Maybe you should wrap it up.
It's 4:00 in the morning.

16:55.114 --> 16:56.923
Is it really?
Yeah.

16:57.049 --> 17:00.189
Oh, my gosh. Wow. Well,
that flew by, huh?

17:00.352 --> 17:04.198
I will just take these down to
the post office and put the...

17:07.326 --> 17:09.203
Jeez. Oh, no.

17:09.994 --> 17:13.135
I put the handout fliers
in the mailing envelopes.

17:13.232 --> 17:15.644
And I was supposed to put these
fliers in the envelopes.

17:16.502 --> 17:19.175
Oh, my God.

17:20.739 --> 17:23.151
Well, you know,
it's like I always say.

17:23.208 --> 17:25.814
It ain't government work if you
don't have to do it twice.

17:27.279 --> 17:28.656
Here we go!

17:29.915 --> 17:31.155
I'll make some coffee.

17:31.216 --> 17:32.889
Hey, you're
blocking my driveway.

17:36.422 --> 17:38.265
Leslie Knope? What are you doing?
Hi, um...

17:38.323 --> 17:40.428
Mr. Wood, I'm so sorry.

17:40.526 --> 17:43.097
Oh, my God. I can't see.
It's so bright out here.

17:43.862 --> 17:45.967
We drove here
to ask you...

17:46.265 --> 17:48.541
No, to beg you to
please destroy that tape.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.136
Yeah, I got your
50 messages.

17:50.202 --> 17:52.409
Leslie was just out with her
friends blowing off some steam.

17:52.471 --> 17:53.472
What?

17:54.006 --> 17:56.850
Please. Please. Please, please, please.
That's five pleases.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.445
As much as I
enjoy the groveling

17:58.510 --> 18:00.353
I can't destroy the tape
because I don't have it.

18:00.813 --> 18:04.522
Because your sad, tiny,
backwater airport lost my bags.

18:05.784 --> 18:06.956
Oh, really?

18:07.019 --> 18:08.760
You'd think a commuter
airport could handle

18:08.887 --> 18:10.662
the luggage of
11 people at once,

18:10.722 --> 18:12.030
but apparently not.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.661
Completely
ruined a great story.

18:13.725 --> 18:16.501
Thank God for that mitten
factory tragedy. Yeah.

18:17.729 --> 18:18.935
Okay. Great.
Okay.

18:18.997 --> 18:21.307
Then, we should... Let's... Goodbye.
We're going to go.

18:25.137 --> 18:26.377
Ah, screw it.

18:30.242 --> 18:31.744
Fun Ben lives.

18:35.747 --> 18:38.785
April, Andrew,
good morning to you both.

18:38.851 --> 18:40.455
Donuts. Go nuts.

18:43.555 --> 18:45.626
Hey. You kids need any money?
No.

18:45.691 --> 18:48.501
Go buy yourself a Walkman How
much is a Walkman nowadays?

18:48.560 --> 18:50.767
Probably more than $20.
Here's $25.

18:50.829 --> 18:52.900
Hey, guys. I just
wanted to come by

18:53.031 --> 18:55.102
and thank you for
a phenomenal evening.

18:55.267 --> 18:58.441
Yeah. Seems like we all had
a phenomenal evening.

18:58.504 --> 19:00.950
And I should probably thank you
for introducing me to Linda.

19:01.073 --> 19:04.714
I think we had a deep emotional
connection that is very worth exploring.

19:05.144 --> 19:08.614
So, I'm going to ask her out again,
once she's emotionally ready.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.921
Hey, Ron. Great red shirt.

19:12.484 --> 19:15.522
Dude, Ron, you have to
tell him what happened.

19:15.587 --> 19:17.430
Why? It's none of his business.

19:17.656 --> 19:19.727
Because he's been
super sad lately.

19:20.058 --> 19:22.197
Kind of seems like you should
at least give him a heads-up

19:22.261 --> 19:23.604
so he doesn't
get rejected again.

19:23.662 --> 19:28.168
I like to not get involved in these
matters, or any matters, of any nature.

19:28.233 --> 19:30.213
You know, Ron,
someone once told me

19:30.269 --> 19:33.682
that this is not how grownups
deal with tough situations.

19:33.906 --> 19:35.817
We face them head-on.

19:38.577 --> 19:39.681
Fine.

19:41.580 --> 19:44.561
Oh, my God, Ron. It was
you who told me that.

19:45.384 --> 19:46.863
That's crazy.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.360
There's that shirt.

19:50.422 --> 19:53.528
Look, Chris.
After the bar last night

19:56.061 --> 19:59.873
I engaged in consensual
activities with Linda.

20:01.700 --> 20:02.701
I see.

20:02.768 --> 20:04.839
I didn't plan it,
but it occurred.

20:06.004 --> 20:07.005
Now you know.

20:07.739 --> 20:09.741
Well, thank you for being
forthright and telling me.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.454
You're a good man, Ron.

20:18.850 --> 20:20.386
I'm quite lonely.

20:22.988 --> 20:24.331
They say
to win an election,

20:24.389 --> 20:26.926
you have to be good
and you have to be lucky.

20:27.859 --> 20:30.567
<i>I got pretty damn
lucky when I met Ben</i>

20:30.896 --> 20:33.502
And I'm lucky that Ann and Tom
and all my other friends

20:33.565 --> 20:35.567
volunteered
to help me out.

20:35.634 --> 20:37.636
And I'm super lucky
that that tape disappeared.

20:42.741 --> 20:45.722
I think we may have used up
all our luck tonight.

20:46.345 --> 20:48.325
Actually, not all of it.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.253
He's about to get lucky.

20:51.016 --> 20:52.256
It's on.

20:52.451 --> 20:54.453
He doesn't even
know it yet.

20:56.955 --> 20:58.832
Hey.
Hey, sweetheart.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.661
I'm not sure you're
even aware of this,

21:00.726 --> 21:03.935
but we have now gone 48 hours
without breaking up.

21:03.996 --> 21:05.373
Shattering our
previous record.

21:05.430 --> 21:06.431
That's not bad.

21:06.498 --> 21:07.499
To celebrate...

21:07.566 --> 21:10.103
Oh, please don't Whatever
this is, I don't want it.

21:10.168 --> 21:12.671
Just a little 48-hour
anniversary gift.

21:12.738 --> 21:13.842
Okay.

21:17.476 --> 21:18.978
Condoms.
48 of them.

21:19.511 --> 21:20.785
A different flavor
for each hour.

21:20.846 --> 21:23.087
Yeah. We're not dating anymore.
Okay? Get out.

21:23.148 --> 21:24.855
No. Wait. Don't punish
me I took a risk. Yeah.

21:24.916 --> 21:25.917
Yeah. Bye.
