WEBVTT

00:17.434 --> 00:20.060
ANNOUNCER: Pantora in peril!

00:20.103 --> 00:23.397
The newly elected Chairman of Pantora,
Baron Papanoida,

00:23.440 --> 00:25.941
is caught in a deadly political game.

00:26.109 --> 00:28.610
The Trade Federation
has blockaded Pantora

00:28.778 --> 00:31.447
and suspended all commerce
with the system.

00:31.573 --> 00:33.282
Isolated from the rest of the Republic,

00:33.575 --> 00:36.618
the people of Pantora are beginning
to rally against the Senate,

00:36.703 --> 00:39.288
who have seemed unsympathetic
to their plight.

00:39.414 --> 00:43.292
To make matters worse, Count Dooku
has come forward, offering aid

00:43.418 --> 00:46.378
if Pantora joins the Separatist alliance.

00:46.463 --> 00:49.798
Chairman Papanoida has dispatched
Senator Chuchi to Coruscant

00:49.924 --> 00:53.427
with the hope that she can motivate
the Senate to act in favor of Pantora

00:53.470 --> 00:56.638
before Lott Dod can legitimize
the blockade.

00:56.765 --> 01:00.142
The Trade Federation is neutral in this,

01:00.226 --> 01:02.936
but Pantora must pay its debt

01:02.979 --> 01:06.482
before we can resume commerce
with the system.

01:06.691 --> 01:07.858
That is a lie.

01:07.942 --> 01:11.361
It is well known that the Trade Federation
is aligned with the Separatists.

01:11.529 --> 01:12.738
Slanderous!

01:12.822 --> 01:16.742
We are not Separatists simply
because we do business with them.

01:16.993 --> 01:22.664
How many times must I remind you
of the Commerce Treaty of 1647?

01:22.832 --> 01:25.834
The Trade Federation is neutral.

01:26.127 --> 01:28.504
I beg the Senate to listen to our pleas.

01:28.588 --> 01:30.756
Ignore the Trade Federation's
feeble attempt

01:30.840 --> 01:32.841
to paint this as a domestic financial issue

01:32.926 --> 01:35.385
and allow us to resume trade.

01:35.720 --> 01:38.138
(ALL APPLAUDING)

01:49.442 --> 01:51.276
Wait! Senator Chuchi.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.363
I wanted to compliment you
on your speech.

01:54.447 --> 01:56.865
-Thank you, PadmÃ©.
-You are very brave.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.201
The Trade Federation doesn't frighten me.

01:59.452 --> 02:02.287
I just wanted to let you know
that there are many of us in the Senate

02:02.372 --> 02:05.165
that support you and Pantora
in these difficult times.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.001
I know the Separatists have
approached you to offer their help.

02:08.211 --> 02:09.837
Please do not take it.

02:10.171 --> 02:13.006
The Senate will force the Trade Federation
to resume trade.

02:13.341 --> 02:14.758
Don't worry, Senator.

02:14.843 --> 02:18.011
There's no way that Pantora will ever
have dealings with the Separatists.

02:18.096 --> 02:20.264
We'll always be loyal to the Republic.

02:20.473 --> 02:23.016
The Chairman of Pantora has just arrived.
I must go brief him.

02:23.518 --> 02:25.394
Please, send him my best wishes.

02:27.897 --> 02:30.440
-Chairman Papanoida.
-Senator Chuchi.

02:30.525 --> 02:33.318
You spoke well
on behalf of our people today.

02:33.403 --> 02:35.863
I only hope the Senate is truly listening.

02:36.114 --> 02:37.239
As do I, Chairman.

02:37.657 --> 02:39.867
Allow me to introduce my family.

02:39.951 --> 02:44.246
These are my daughters, Chi Eekway
and Che Amanwe, and my son, Ion.

02:44.998 --> 02:48.208
Father, Amanwe and I are going home.
Don't be too late.

02:48.376 --> 02:52.546
I won't be long. Ion and I have some issues
to discuss with the Senator first.

02:55.425 --> 02:57.801
Things are deteriorating rapidly, Senator.

02:57.969 --> 02:59.720
Ion has just brought word from Pantora

02:59.804 --> 03:02.556
that things are far worse
than we've been led to believe.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.183
The people are restless.

03:04.267 --> 03:07.102
The Trade Federation blockade is causing
far more damage and disorder

03:07.187 --> 03:09.563
-than we predicted.
-We need more time.

03:09.647 --> 03:11.732
The Senate will vote in our favor,
I'm sure of it.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.568
Count Dooku and the Separatists
are promising immediate aid

03:14.652 --> 03:16.778
and a resolution to the blockade.

03:17.071 --> 03:19.156
You're not suggesting we join them,
are you?

03:19.324 --> 03:20.699
Certainly not.

03:20.783 --> 03:25.078
I merely point out that the wheels
of democracy are moving too slowly.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.748
There are Pantorans rallying
for us to leave the Republic

03:27.832 --> 03:29.333
and join the Separatists.

03:29.584 --> 03:31.793
We cannot give up
on the Republic Senate!

03:31.878 --> 03:35.756
Chairman, you must convince the people
to remain loyal to our cause.

03:36.132 --> 03:38.217
I will do what I can, Senator.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.185
What's wrong with the lights?

03:48.770 --> 03:50.395
Did you see that?

03:50.480 --> 03:52.773
It's nothing,
just the shadows playing tricks.

03:58.363 --> 04:00.280
Don't tell me you are afraid of the dark?

04:02.033 --> 04:03.200
Chi?

04:06.579 --> 04:09.414
Chi? Stop fooling around.

04:11.334 --> 04:12.334
(CHUCKLING)

04:14.212 --> 04:18.924
My father's a powerful man.
If you hurt me or my sister, you'll be dead!

04:23.596 --> 04:26.390
Big talk. You're coming with us!

04:33.898 --> 04:34.940
Hurry! Let's go!

04:46.786 --> 04:49.788
I don't like the situation on Pantora
one bit.

04:49.872 --> 04:53.041
It reminds me far too much
of Naboo's own scarred history.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.752
Well, that blockade wasn't that bad.

04:56.087 --> 04:58.130
It's the reason I met you, after all.

04:58.339 --> 05:02.009
(LAUGHS) You certainly have a unique way
of looking at things, Ani.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.928
Senator Amidala! Master Skywalker!

05:05.013 --> 05:06.179
What is it, Ahsoka?

05:06.264 --> 05:09.224
Someone has kidnapped
Chairman Papanoida's daughters.

05:09.434 --> 05:12.769
(SIGHS) I was afraid something like this
would happen. Anakin?

05:13.062 --> 05:16.857
The Jedi can't get involved.
This is a job for the local police.

05:16.941 --> 05:19.609
I'm not so sure
local authorities can handle it.

05:19.694 --> 05:22.988
The Separatists are putting a lot
of pressure on Pantora to join them.

05:23.072 --> 05:26.408
I'm afraid this blockade may give
the Pantorans no other choice.

05:26.617 --> 05:31.580
Master, if the Jedi can't officially
get involved, let me do this on my own.

05:32.081 --> 05:34.082
Senator Chuchi is a good friend of mine.

05:34.250 --> 05:38.795
All right. With the Separatists involved,
I guess it gives you cause to investigate.

05:38.880 --> 05:42.466
Go help Senator Chuchi, but don't get
in the way of the local authorities.

05:42.550 --> 05:43.967
Aren't you going to help?

05:44.052 --> 05:48.305
I said the situation gives "you"
cause to investigate, not "us."

05:48.389 --> 05:49.681
I need to go back to the Jedi Temple

05:49.766 --> 05:53.185
and make sure the Council doesn't find out
about your little expedition.

05:53.269 --> 05:55.771
Should you really proceed
without the Council's approval?

05:56.314 --> 05:59.232
-We do it all the time, don't we, Snips?
-Yep.

05:59.442 --> 06:00.942
Well, be careful, Ahsoka.

06:01.652 --> 06:03.612
I still can't believe they let you teach.

06:05.323 --> 06:07.949
Give your father my condolences.

06:08.034 --> 06:11.661
lf you want your sisters back,
we're here to help.

06:13.623 --> 06:18.210
Father, Count Dooku has offered to help us
find Chi Eekway and Che Amanwe.

06:19.796 --> 06:23.757
Chuchi, Senator Amidala sent me to help,
if I can.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.425
Chairman Papanoida.

06:25.510 --> 06:27.302
This is my good friend Ahsoka.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.305
Good. A Jedi can always be of help.

06:30.390 --> 06:34.142
Senator Amidala thinks this may have
something to do with the Separatists.

06:34.227 --> 06:37.771
They've already made contact with us.
I don't think this is a kidnapping.

06:37.855 --> 06:39.481
I think they're holding them hostage.

06:39.565 --> 06:43.026
A not very subtle attempt
to get us to join the Separatists?

06:43.194 --> 06:45.862
If the Separatists are involved,
your daughters may be held

06:45.947 --> 06:48.657
on the Trade Federation ship
blockading your planet.

06:49.325 --> 06:52.202
That is a possibility.

06:52.286 --> 06:54.496
Why don't you and Chuchi
pay them a diplomatic visit

06:54.580 --> 06:56.415
and see what you can find out?

06:56.666 --> 07:00.168
We'll stay here
and follow the police investigation.

07:05.842 --> 07:07.342
Did you find anything?

07:07.510 --> 07:10.387
We've completed a thorough sweep
of your apartment, Chairman.

07:10.513 --> 07:11.847
No evidence of foul play.

07:12.014 --> 07:14.683
My daughters' lives are in your hands,
Inspector.

07:15.017 --> 07:17.185
You have nothing to worry about,
Your Honor.

07:17.228 --> 07:20.230
We are in complete control
of the situation.

07:26.863 --> 07:30.866
That inspector is useless!
They must have left clues somewhere.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.869
Look here. The icon of the moon goddess.

07:35.037 --> 07:37.372
It should be up on the shrine
with the others.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.545
Wait a minute! What's this?

07:44.213 --> 07:45.255
Blood?

07:45.506 --> 07:48.884
It must be what they used
to fight off their attackers.

07:48.926 --> 07:52.387
But the kidnappers didn't know
to put it back in the right place.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.140
(SCANNER VIBRATING)

07:56.559 --> 07:59.686

I need you to match this blood sample

07:59.729 --> 08:01.563
against known galactic criminals.

08:05.776 --> 08:06.860
ION: A Rodian.

08:07.528 --> 08:09.196
Says here his name's Greedo.

08:09.906 --> 08:12.407
Looks like he's based on Tatooine.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.284
Then what are we waiting for?

08:45.107 --> 08:48.443
Senator Chuchi.
To what do we owe this pleasure?

08:48.611 --> 08:50.570
I bring word from the Chairman of Pantora.

08:50.905 --> 08:54.282
The Chairman has finally decided
to agree to our terms?

08:54.575 --> 08:55.742
Not exactly.

08:55.785 --> 08:58.245
The Chairman wanted to inform you
of an impending alliance

08:58.287 --> 09:01.915
between Pantora and
the Confederacy of Independent Systems.

09:02.250 --> 09:05.961
The Chairman is planning
to join the Separatist alliance?

09:06.254 --> 09:09.172
If that were the case, would you remove
your blockade of Pantora?

09:09.423 --> 09:10.882
If that were the case,

09:10.967 --> 09:14.761
the Chairman would have to go
to the Senate and renounce the Republic.

09:14.845 --> 09:18.181
Then we could discuss
how quickly we can resume commerce.

09:18.349 --> 09:20.433
Very well. I shall contact the Chairman.

09:20.518 --> 09:23.436
We can discuss the finer details
of the terms later this evening.

09:23.604 --> 09:24.938
Agreed.

09:25.022 --> 09:29.109
Now you and your servant
may stay as our honored guests.

09:29.193 --> 09:31.570
Come this way to your rooms.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.096
Be careful, Ion.

09:58.180 --> 10:01.433
The Hutts are the only law
that matters on Tatooine.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.269
I don't scare easily.

10:40.931 --> 10:42.557
Shouldn't we talk to Jabba directly?

10:42.808 --> 10:46.895
No. Remember, we're not sure
who's behind this kidnapping yet.

10:46.979 --> 10:49.648
-Jabba could be involved.
-What if Greedo runs?

10:49.982 --> 10:54.110
We'll let Greedo know we're here.
That way, he'll come to us.

10:54.236 --> 10:56.780
-How are we going to do that?
-Follow me.

11:04.330 --> 11:07.624
Ladies! Do any of you know Greedo?

11:09.919 --> 11:11.252
Who's asking?

11:11.587 --> 11:15.340
We're asking.
We're looking to hire a bounty hunter.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.300
He's not here.

11:17.426 --> 11:20.762
But if he comes back,
I'll tell him you were asking for him.

11:24.141 --> 11:25.308
Patience.

11:25.434 --> 11:29.646
If she won't lead us to Greedo,
she'll lead Greedo to us.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.958
This is the ambassador's office.
Maybe we'll find something here.

We need to know who our supporters are.

12:02.012 --> 12:06.307
I understand your profit margins
with the Separatists can be considerable.

12:06.350 --> 12:08.184
However, I object to the kidnapping.

12:09.520 --> 12:14.524
The Chairman's children are leverage.
Besides, they're well taken care of.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.651
Yes, but why on my ship?

12:33.419 --> 12:36.004
I'm sure I heard something.

12:50.060 --> 12:53.688
All of this scheming with the Separatists
is making you paranoid.

12:54.064 --> 12:57.400
Do not worry,
the daughters are not to be harmed,

12:57.526 --> 12:59.235
at least for now.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.202

is behind the kidnapping.

13:36.148 --> 13:37.440
Pantorans.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.776
They must have found some evidence.

13:39.902 --> 13:42.737
We'll have to settle things
more permanently.

13:51.997 --> 13:55.083
-Have you done this before?
-No. But I've been practicing.

13:56.126 --> 13:59.671
The detention block is closed to visitors.
Move along.

This is the fifth area we've checked,

15:20.294 --> 15:22.503
and there's no sign
of the Chairman's daughters.

15:22.838 --> 15:26.007
Can't you sense where they are?
Isn't that something you Jedi can do?

AHSOKA: It's not something
I can just turn on or off.

15:29.261 --> 15:30.553
We'll just have to keep looking.

15:30.763 --> 15:33.765
Sir, we have intruders
in the detention area.

15:34.099 --> 15:38.686
It looks like our guests got
a little too curious for their own good.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.942
(SPEAKING HUTTESE)

15:47.446 --> 15:50.615
Chairman Papanoida,
the mighty Jabba wishes to know

15:50.699 --> 15:53.242
why you tried to kill
one of his bounty hunters.

15:53.619 --> 15:57.246
Great Jabba,
my daughters have been kidnapped.

15:57.831 --> 15:59.958
As a father yourself,
I know you understand

16:00.042 --> 16:03.252
that I will do anything
to get them back safely.

16:04.213 --> 16:06.756
I have evidence that Greedo is responsible,

16:06.840 --> 16:08.758
which means that either you are behind it

16:08.842 --> 16:11.302
or Greedo is working for someone else.

16:12.054 --> 16:16.516
Since we are friends, Jabba,
I know you would never do such a thing.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.267
No! No! He's lying!

16:18.727 --> 16:20.395
(SPEAKING HUTTESE)

16:21.063 --> 16:23.731
We found blood at the scene of the crime.

16:23.816 --> 16:28.152
If it matches Greedo's,
it will prove he is the kidnapper.

16:28.737 --> 16:30.989
(SPEAKING HUTTESE)

16:32.324 --> 16:35.034
Jabba will allow a blood sample
to be taken.

16:35.494 --> 16:37.829
Wait. Wait, no! It's all lies!

16:38.247 --> 16:40.248
(SPEAKING HUTTESE)

16:43.293 --> 16:45.503
Okay, okay! I kidnapped them!

16:45.587 --> 16:48.256
The Separatists wanted leverage
against you.

16:48.924 --> 16:50.717
Where are they, you slime?

16:50.926 --> 16:54.303
One of them is here, at Mos Eisley.
She's safe, I assure you.

16:54.763 --> 16:56.139
Take us there!

17:01.895 --> 17:03.229
Let's hope she's in this one.

17:13.157 --> 17:15.658
Senator Chuchi? How did you find me?

17:17.286 --> 17:19.704
It's a long story. Where's your sister?

17:20.039 --> 17:21.998
I don't know. We were separated.

17:34.803 --> 17:38.973
All right, sleemo, no tricks!
We're gonna go inside and find my sister.

17:39.391 --> 17:40.767
Nice and easy.

17:40.851 --> 17:43.561
You think they will just
hand her over to you?

17:43.645 --> 17:46.105
No, but I'll bet they'll hand her over to you.

18:00.746 --> 18:02.705
Go get the prisoner.

18:06.293 --> 18:07.877
Greedo, what are you doing here?

18:08.712 --> 18:13.424
There's been a change of plans.
We're going to have to move the prisoner.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.218
On whose orders?

18:19.014 --> 18:21.891
Gunray.
He contacted me at Jabba's palace.

18:22.226 --> 18:24.936
Why'd he contact you?
And who are those two?

18:27.940 --> 18:31.609
They're emissaries
of the Trade Federation.

18:31.819 --> 18:35.655
Trade Federation? They don't look
like Trade Federation to me.

18:37.074 --> 18:38.741
-Father!
-Father?

18:39.827 --> 18:41.369
They're Pantorans! Blast them!

19:26.582 --> 19:27.582
Stop them!

19:42.723 --> 19:44.390
Surrender, Separatist!

19:54.026 --> 19:55.443
What is the meaning of this?

19:55.777 --> 19:59.030
You've been holding the Chairman
of Pantora's daughter as a hostage!

19:59.364 --> 20:01.866
What?
Sib Canay, what is she talking about?

20:02.534 --> 20:04.410
I want my litigator.

20:04.703 --> 20:07.747
We are businessmen!
We deal in trade and commerce!

20:08.081 --> 20:11.417
Yes, but perhaps your business
is war profiteering.

20:11.793 --> 20:14.462
-How dare you!
-I dare

20:14.546 --> 20:16.255
because you claim
to have no involvement,

20:16.298 --> 20:19.425
and yet here stands the Chairman's
daughter on your ship,

20:19.468 --> 20:21.135
held by your administrator.

20:21.803 --> 20:23.971
I may understand your position,

20:24.640 --> 20:26.515
but I doubt the rest of the Senate will.

20:26.683 --> 20:28.809
-Blackmail!
-No,

20:28.977 --> 20:30.102
business.

20:30.187 --> 20:31.520
I could, of course, be persuaded

20:31.647 --> 20:34.815
to defend your unfortunate circumstances
to the Senate.

20:35.192 --> 20:37.985
That is, if this blockade ended.

20:39.363 --> 20:41.656
I'll see what I can do.

20:46.954 --> 20:51.707
It has come to our attention
that the ugly head of the Separatist

20:51.833 --> 20:57.672
has once again raised itself in the ranks
of our very own Trade Federation.

20:58.048 --> 21:03.010
Nute Gunray's influence extends farther
than we ever imagined.

21:03.470 --> 21:07.348
It was Sib Canay,
acting on his own accord,

21:07.391 --> 21:10.559
who kidnapped the children
of Chairman Papanoida.

21:11.144 --> 21:14.355
In good faith,
we have returned them to him.

21:14.731 --> 21:17.984
And also, as a gesture of friendship,

21:18.235 --> 21:23.489
we are removing our blockade
and reopening trade with the Pantorans.

22:03.864 --> 22:04.864
