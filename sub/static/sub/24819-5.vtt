WEBVTT

00:19.978 --> 00:21.605
Here. Open it.

00:22.981 --> 00:24.566
Marianne, I...

00:24.650 --> 00:28.529
I appreciate all the thought
that went into this, but...

00:28.612 --> 00:31.782
You're going through so much right now.
You've lost a child.

00:32.699 --> 00:36.411
Well, we didn't lose a child,
it was a failed IVF cycle, so...

00:36.495 --> 00:40.457
I think what Lisa's trying to say is that
we just need a little time.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.334
And space to move on.

00:42.417 --> 00:45.420
It's not about moving on,
it's about acceptance and closure.

00:45.504 --> 00:48.590
And, I mean, it was really expensive,
it was, like, $30,000.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.510
How... How do you know that?

00:51.593 --> 00:54.888
You're staying with me, it's all
you talk about and I read your mail.

00:54.972 --> 00:57.849
You know,
we're just not really big on rituals.

00:57.933 --> 01:00.769
That's valid,
but I have to ask you to light the wick.

01:01.436 --> 01:02.813
-Can you hold that?
-Yeah.

01:03.981 --> 01:05.148
Yep.

01:08.986 --> 01:10.779
-It's working.
-[Marianne] Okay.

01:12.364 --> 01:14.199
You guys are going to have a child.

01:14.283 --> 01:16.535
It might not be on your calendar,

01:16.618 --> 01:18.912
but it will be on the universe's calendar.

01:19.663 --> 01:21.790
I'm gonna leave you two alone now.

01:26.837 --> 01:28.422
Hey, we're gonna try again.

01:29.172 --> 01:32.259
[Lisa] It just sucks that it happened
when I didn't want it to and...

01:34.052 --> 01:36.555
and now I can't make it work
any way I try.

02:07.502 --> 02:09.796
-It's fine.
-It's fine. No, it's good.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.216
[Lisa] Shit, that tree's gonna go up.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.843
We didn't see it.

02:27.064 --> 02:28.398
[pan sizzles]

02:33.403 --> 02:34.613
The eggs are burning.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.824
Honey, the eggs are burning. It's okay.

02:46.917 --> 02:49.002
-I'm gonna go to bed.
-Okay.

02:59.596 --> 03:00.430
Whoa.

03:00.514 --> 03:01.765
Lots of hits.

03:11.233 --> 03:12.776
North Fork?

03:17.864 --> 03:19.866
They make wine on Long Island?

03:24.371 --> 03:27.040
-Washing dishes, huh?
-Yes, I am.

03:30.043 --> 03:32.462
-Can you stop staring at me?
-[1940s voice] But you're so pretty.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.423
Why are you doing a 1940s guy?

03:34.506 --> 03:36.842
I just wanted to see if you're okay.

03:36.925 --> 03:37.843
I'm fine.

03:39.678 --> 03:40.721
Wow.

03:40.804 --> 03:41.847
What's this?

03:41.930 --> 03:45.767
It's, like, a wine
from the North Fork of Long Island.

03:45.851 --> 03:48.478
Hey, you know what?
Why don't we go wine-tasting?

03:48.562 --> 03:50.272
-Wine-tasting?
-Yeah.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.441
No, I think I'd rather just stay in

03:52.524 --> 03:55.110
and watch a dumb movie and sleep.

03:55.193 --> 03:56.528
Very cool.

03:57.487 --> 04:00.532
Or... we could round up the crew

04:00.615 --> 04:02.826
and get a party bus and go check it out.

04:02.909 --> 04:04.411
-A party bus?
-Yeah!

04:04.494 --> 04:07.038
Yeah, it'll be great.
I really think we need this.

04:07.122 --> 04:11.042
I think it would be good for us and I am
positive it would make you feel better.

04:11.126 --> 04:13.086
And, plus, these Long Island wines,

04:13.170 --> 04:15.213
they say it's the new Napa Valley and...

04:15.297 --> 04:16.965
Okay, let's do it.

04:17.048 --> 04:18.467
-Really?
-Yeah.

04:18.550 --> 04:20.427
-So you're not humoring me?
-No.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.345
-It'll be fun.
-I love you, honey.

04:23.013 --> 04:24.556
[1940s voice] I'll see you, tutz.

04:24.639 --> 04:26.558
-[1940s voice] Take care, darling.
-Take care.

04:26.641 --> 04:29.352
Hit the bricks.
Get to the workplace, Rosie the Riveter.

04:29.436 --> 04:30.395
[mimics machinery]

04:30.479 --> 04:32.606
[therapist]
So, how was your conversation with Ethan?

04:36.526 --> 04:39.696
When we spoke last week,
you said you were going to end the affair.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.949
I'm ending it this weekend.
We're going on a wine-tasting trip.

04:43.033 --> 04:45.786
And why does everyone
insist on calling it an affair?

04:46.995 --> 04:49.706
-What would you call it?
-I don't believe in labels.

04:49.790 --> 04:53.543
-Would you consider yourself married?
-I'm losing my train of thought.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.962
Can you stay focused, please?

04:56.797 --> 04:59.007
Is it gonna be just the two of you
on this trip?

04:59.090 --> 05:02.511
No! Are you crazy?
The whole friend group is going.

05:02.594 --> 05:05.931
I'm worried about his reaction,
which is why I'm doing it in public.

05:06.473 --> 05:08.266
What do you mean, public?

05:08.350 --> 05:10.894
I'm gonna tell him on the party bus
and let him deal.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.566
I hope you're writing down
the word "breakthrough".

05:17.150 --> 05:18.276
I am not.

05:19.361 --> 05:22.405
[rap music plays]

05:23.365 --> 05:25.617
Oh, my God.

05:26.618 --> 05:29.830
Ladies, your chariot awaits.

05:29.913 --> 05:33.959
I'm really glad you went for
the heartbeat laser option.

05:34.543 --> 05:36.253
-It's classy.
-Real classy.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.129
No, it's dangerous.

05:44.261 --> 05:47.222
[rap music blares]

05:50.475 --> 05:51.518
[gives snort of derision]

05:54.688 --> 05:55.814
Hi!

05:55.897 --> 05:57.440
[cheering]

05:58.984 --> 06:01.486
-What is this?
-[Lisa] Party bus!

06:02.946 --> 06:05.574
Party bus! Party bus, it's a party bus!

06:13.331 --> 06:17.294
Hey, welcome, friends,
to adult spring break!

06:19.671 --> 06:22.799
I want everyone to take a gander
at the itineraries Lisa and I prepared.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.510
-Urgh! I wouldn't touch that.
-Why not?

06:25.594 --> 06:29.014
You're good.
I Purell that real heavy after every go.

06:31.141 --> 06:33.351
-Thank you, Joe.
-Why?

06:33.435 --> 06:36.313
-[Lisa] Let's not ask questions.
-What happened to the pole?

06:36.396 --> 06:38.940
So I am very excited about exploring

06:39.024 --> 06:42.902
the burgeoning local
Long Island wine scene with you guys.

06:42.986 --> 06:45.155
Some are calling it the new Napa.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.531
I never heard that.

06:47.115 --> 06:49.909
Okay. So, anyway, we are...

06:49.993 --> 06:53.413
we're gonna hit four
of the North Fork's premier vineyards.

06:53.496 --> 06:56.291
-Hear, hear! Cheers to that!
-Well, thank you, Felix.

06:56.374 --> 06:59.044
-I like your attitude, Felix.
-Yes, you're welcome.

06:59.127 --> 07:02.672
And I want everyone to know that
after a long talk with Max last night,

07:02.756 --> 07:05.675
I have decided to go ahead
and try to like you.

07:06.801 --> 07:10.221
Which was a conversation we had
in the privacy of our own home

07:10.305 --> 07:11.389
just between us.

07:11.473 --> 07:13.350
-[Felix] I'm sorry.
-[Nick] That's sweet.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.227
I want everyone to know
I am not here to judge

07:16.311 --> 07:19.481
how unhealthy or juvenile
these friendships are.

07:19.564 --> 07:22.609
I just wanna...
You know what, let's just get wasted.

07:22.692 --> 07:23.860
That is achievable!

07:23.944 --> 07:25.278
[whoops]

07:25.362 --> 07:28.531
Okay, we have to pace ourselves,
because at the fourth vineyard,

07:28.615 --> 07:31.034
after our tour,
we are going to a private dinner

07:31.117 --> 07:34.037
in one of the most pristine beaches
on the North Fork,

07:34.120 --> 07:36.331
and time that to coincide with...

07:36.414 --> 07:37.582
Ethan vomiting!

07:38.124 --> 07:39.042
[murmurs of agreement]

07:39.125 --> 07:42.003
Very good, but actually
quite the opposite. I will enjoy...

07:42.087 --> 07:43.755
Ethan swallowing vomit.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.341
[all talking over one another]

07:46.424 --> 07:47.759
One's out and one's in.

07:47.842 --> 07:49.511
Hilarious.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.262
[Max] It's short on details.

07:51.346 --> 07:53.056
[Nick] Guys, just let him talk.

07:53.139 --> 07:57.060
-Let him talk. Come on. Alright.
-You're right. Okay, hun, you got this.

07:57.686 --> 07:58.687
[Nick] Go.

07:58.770 --> 08:00.522
Dinner is going to coincide with...

08:00.605 --> 08:01.898
It still feels confusing.

08:02.774 --> 08:04.776
[all talk at once]

08:04.859 --> 08:07.445
[in goofy voice] Alright, okay.
Are you guys done yet?

08:07.529 --> 08:11.282
Is everybody done or are we still
gonna keep going with the interjections?

08:11.366 --> 08:12.367
Okay, what are we doing?

08:12.450 --> 08:13.368
[makes gargling noise]

08:13.994 --> 08:15.870
Okay, this just got weird.

08:15.954 --> 08:16.955
Continue.

08:18.289 --> 08:20.709
-Dinner is going to coincide...
-Oh, my God.

08:20.792 --> 08:22.877
...with sunset

08:22.961 --> 08:24.337
on the Peconic Bay.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.090
[noises of approval]

08:27.966 --> 08:30.719
My buddy here says
you guys are gonna be the new Napa.

08:30.802 --> 08:31.636
Napa?

08:31.720 --> 08:33.638
-Yeah.
-Wait a minute, bud.

08:33.722 --> 08:35.223
You can't compare us to Napa.

08:35.306 --> 08:37.392
They've been doing this for 400 years.

08:37.475 --> 08:41.062
We've pretty much just started
and the climate's less than ideal, pal.

08:41.146 --> 08:43.606
Got it. Sorry about that.

08:43.690 --> 08:44.983
It's alright. No worries.

08:45.817 --> 08:49.320
I'm sure it's great. You must have
a lot of people coming to taste wines.

08:49.404 --> 08:50.780
[guide] We actually do.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.949
-What are you filming?
-It's cool.

08:53.575 --> 08:55.035
When are you gonna watch it?

08:55.618 --> 08:58.371
Hey, I'm really sorry to hear the news.

08:59.039 --> 09:01.958
I was so sure it was gonna work.
In my head, it already had.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.543
I was never so optimistic.

09:03.626 --> 09:05.462
You're so young, Froshy.

09:05.545 --> 09:08.089
At my age,
it only works 35% of the time, so...

09:08.923 --> 09:12.510
Well, I'm surprised you're,
you know, out doing this.

09:12.594 --> 09:16.014
Yeah, I'm surprised, too.
Ethan thought it would be a good idea.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.516
-That makes sense.
-Yeah.

09:18.600 --> 09:21.978
Here is our sparkling Pinot Noir.
This is Springsteen's favorite.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.313
-[Ethan] Cool.
-[Nick] Awesome.

09:23.396 --> 09:26.149
[Nick] What wine is your favorite?
Which do you like to drink?

09:27.025 --> 09:28.568
I'm sober, dude.

09:28.651 --> 09:32.155
[bartender] Alright, guys, next we have
our walking red Cabernet.

09:33.156 --> 09:35.700
Great for both binge watching
and binge drinking.

09:35.784 --> 09:37.035
[Ethan] Nicely played, Jesse!

09:37.118 --> 09:39.871
This goes great with a rigatoni bolognese,

09:39.954 --> 09:42.082
a lamb chop and any type of white fish.

09:42.165 --> 09:44.626
-So basically just food.
-Pretty much, yes.

09:44.709 --> 09:46.419
-Okay.
-It's good.

09:47.045 --> 09:49.214
-To the friend group.
-[all] To the friend group!

09:49.297 --> 09:50.507
[all] Cheers!

09:50.590 --> 09:52.092
[Marianne] Yeah, new friends!

09:52.175 --> 09:53.760
New friends, yeah.

09:54.344 --> 09:55.220
Urgh!

09:55.303 --> 09:57.138
-[Max] Oh, my God.
-What happened in my mouth?

09:57.222 --> 09:59.057
-It isn't that bad.
-Are you kidding?

09:59.140 --> 10:01.184
-It's bad.
-It smells like perfume.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.852
But then it tastes like perfume.

10:03.645 --> 10:05.814
I'm getting a hint of Robitussin...

10:06.356 --> 10:08.691
with a patina of Pop Rocks.

10:08.775 --> 10:09.651
[all] Yes.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.820
I'm getting more of like a New Coke

10:11.903 --> 10:14.197
with like a Mountain Dew Red kind of...

10:14.280 --> 10:16.324
You know, it's like very sugar forward.

10:16.407 --> 10:18.493
It's like it doesn't wanna be
in your mouth.

10:18.576 --> 10:20.286
-It is fighting.
-That is great.

10:20.370 --> 10:22.455
It feels like I'm in a bubble bath

10:22.539 --> 10:25.458
and I dip my head under the water

10:25.542 --> 10:27.043
and I choked.

10:30.255 --> 10:32.006
[Sam] Yeah!

10:32.090 --> 10:33.758
[Marianne] That's good, yeah.

10:33.842 --> 10:34.968
How is everything?

10:35.051 --> 10:36.427
-[Ethan] Fantastic.
-[all] Great.

10:37.595 --> 10:41.057
So next what we're gonna pour for you
is our Red State red Merlot.

10:41.141 --> 10:44.144
-[Ethan] The Red State red Merlot!
-The owner is tight with Christie.

10:44.227 --> 10:45.061
[Ethan] Understood.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.647
This is great for both Republicans
and Democrats.

10:47.730 --> 10:49.440
-[Nick] Okay.
-[Max] Okay.

10:49.524 --> 10:53.111
[Jesse] I've begged my boss to change
the name. We're losing half the customers.

10:53.194 --> 10:55.738
-[Ethan] That's probably the reason.
-[Marianne] The name.

10:55.822 --> 10:58.116
-[Nick] Yeah, it's definitely the name.
-[Max] Oh, guys...

11:00.076 --> 11:01.035
Guys...

11:20.346 --> 11:21.848
What are you guys doing?

11:21.931 --> 11:23.850
-Slo-mo walk.
-Just doing slow motion.

11:23.933 --> 11:26.519
-Slo-mo, it's really cool.
-Blink slow.

11:31.608 --> 11:32.609
Hey, Lisa.

11:33.192 --> 11:34.861
Felix, don't worry about it, okay?

11:34.944 --> 11:36.446
No, I just wanna say...

11:37.989 --> 11:40.658
You know, there's something
a mentor of mine used to say

11:40.742 --> 11:42.201
that I always found helpful.

11:42.285 --> 11:43.953
He used to say,

11:44.037 --> 11:45.830
"It's just a bunch of cells."

11:46.664 --> 11:47.540
Oh.

11:47.624 --> 11:49.334
Okay. Yeah, thank you.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.544
It's really funny when you think about it.

11:52.462 --> 11:53.421
Yeah.

11:53.796 --> 11:54.756
Erm...

11:57.800 --> 11:58.718
Okay.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.262
-Alright. Okay.
-Okay.

12:01.346 --> 12:02.555
Thanks.

12:02.639 --> 12:05.808
And, hey, don't beat yourself up about it.

12:05.892 --> 12:08.061
Because 5% or 6% of the time

12:08.144 --> 12:10.188
you can chalk it all up to lab error.

12:11.689 --> 12:12.899
Okay.

12:16.486 --> 12:17.654
-Hey.
-Hey.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.906
-How did that go?
-Really well. Yeah.

12:19.989 --> 12:22.575
You were right,
she needed to hear from me.

12:23.159 --> 12:24.202
[Ethan] What's going on?

12:25.495 --> 12:28.581
-Felix just said the weirdest thing.
-[in nerd voice] That's a big surprise.

12:28.665 --> 12:29.999
Can you stop with the voice?

12:30.083 --> 12:32.710
Sorry. I didn't know
you were being serious. What?

12:32.794 --> 12:37.090
5% to 6% of the time
it doesn't work because of lab error.

12:37.173 --> 12:38.549
Oh, weird.

12:39.300 --> 12:43.304
Well, I guess 95% of the time it is
what we think it is - a failed IVF cycle.

12:43.388 --> 12:45.848
I know, but 5% to 6% is huge.

12:45.932 --> 12:49.435
I mean... why would he tell me that?

12:49.519 --> 12:53.564
That's like as if Marianne
out of our group just disappeared.

12:53.648 --> 12:56.109
It's more like if
a quarter of Marianne disappeared.

12:56.192 --> 12:58.945
-Are you listening?
-Of course, but I don't want you to worry.

12:59.028 --> 13:01.823
I really want us to try to focus
on moving forward.

13:02.991 --> 13:04.158
Yeah, you're right.

13:04.242 --> 13:07.537
No, I've been taking these doctors'
opinions much too seriously.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.665
We should just... you know,
lighten up and have fun.

13:10.748 --> 13:12.875
-Who cares?
-That's not what I meant.

13:12.959 --> 13:15.378
-Hey! What's up, nerds?
-Hey, buddy.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.964
Have you tried the candied walnuts.
They're sick!

13:18.047 --> 13:19.590
Hit me.

13:19.674 --> 13:21.884
Oh, seal thing!

13:22.844 --> 13:23.845
Ow!

13:24.429 --> 13:26.264
-Dude, what the hell, man?
-Sorry.

13:26.347 --> 13:27.640
You got it this time.

13:28.391 --> 13:29.976
-Yes!
-Still got it!

13:30.601 --> 13:32.687
-Still got it.
-Come on, let's get wasted!

13:32.770 --> 13:34.981
-Let's do it. Come on, bro.
-Okay.

13:35.064 --> 13:38.109
-You want more of my nuts in your face?
-No, I'm good.

13:38.192 --> 13:40.278
-Just your wife?
-Hilarious, yeah.

13:40.361 --> 13:42.071
-Bro?
-Lisa...

13:42.155 --> 13:44.991
-Your wife liked my nuts in her face.
-I got you, man.

13:49.078 --> 13:51.122
So this is the size of the baby

13:51.205 --> 13:53.291
that Ethan and I did not have.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.292
[all] Oh...

13:54.375 --> 13:56.252
I'm an expert and that's too big.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.088
-[Felix] That's... Wow!
-[Sam] Gross!

13:59.172 --> 14:00.089
[Max] You ate your baby!

14:00.173 --> 14:02.133
-[noise like a buzzer] Wrong subject!
-Okay.

14:02.216 --> 14:04.761
Hold on, watch this. Hold on.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.096
-Wow. Do it.
-Oh, no. What's going on here?

14:07.180 --> 14:08.514
Driver, put on my music.

14:08.598 --> 14:09.682
You got it!

14:10.892 --> 14:12.977
Here we go.

14:13.061 --> 14:14.771
["Tik Tok" by Kesha playing]

14:15.688 --> 14:17.148
[cheering]

14:17.231 --> 14:19.984
Oh, oh!

14:20.068 --> 14:21.569
Baby, I love you!

14:21.652 --> 14:23.696
Hold on. I'm gonna do the worm.

14:26.908 --> 14:28.326
No, hold on!

14:32.872 --> 14:34.082
He's just asleep.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.127
That's the worm!

14:38.211 --> 14:39.253
Yeah!

15:08.574 --> 15:09.575
[Max] Hey!

15:11.411 --> 15:13.496
Please tell me that's grape juice.

15:14.205 --> 15:17.667
-It's definitely grape juice.
-That's not grape juice. Hey...

15:18.709 --> 15:21.629
Oh, my God! It's not grape juice. Okay.

15:22.213 --> 15:24.257
We can't leave Joe in the van, right?

15:24.340 --> 15:26.717
It doesn't seem fair
while we're getting our drink on.

15:26.801 --> 15:28.594
-I was getting lonely.
-Yeah.

15:28.678 --> 15:32.807
Wow! Okay, well, dude, I'd say, like,
drinking and driving's uncool, you know?

15:32.890 --> 15:35.476
I got a high tolerance
because of CrossFit.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.353
Yeah. I've heard that.

15:37.437 --> 15:40.398
-I'm a doctor, and that is accurate.
-[Joe] Thank you.

15:40.481 --> 15:43.109
Hey, how is your eye?
It's looking pretty rough.

15:43.192 --> 15:44.819
-Really?
-Yeah. You want these?

15:44.902 --> 15:47.155
Okay, no problem. Here we go. Yeah.

15:50.032 --> 15:52.243
-We should get going.
-What do we want next?

15:52.326 --> 15:55.621
Because I'm buying
because the doctor's in.

15:55.705 --> 15:56.789

at sunset on the bay.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.047
Objection, your Honor.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.632
Not my itinerary.

16:06.716 --> 16:09.886
Hey!
I'm gonna do a pole dance, bitches!

16:10.428 --> 16:14.182
Who wants to get on this bus
and see that shit, huh? Here we go!

16:14.265 --> 16:15.266
Woo!

16:15.349 --> 16:16.267
Yeah!

16:18.019 --> 16:20.021
You look great, baby. Got some moves.

16:20.104 --> 16:23.024
-Thanks, sweetheart.
-Just not the moves to get me pregnant.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.823
To my infertility!

16:32.533 --> 16:34.660
That's a strange thing to cheer to.

16:34.744 --> 16:36.287
No need to say that. Not funny.

-[Ethan] Jesus!
-[Nick] Oh, she touched it!

16:46.255 --> 16:48.049
You've got hand VD!

17:04.607 --> 17:06.776
-[Lisa] This is nice.
-It's alright, come on.

17:07.985 --> 17:10.530
We party! Party!

17:10.613 --> 17:12.657
I like this one.

17:12.740 --> 17:15.701
-[Marianne] The blend is really good.
-[Nick] This is like a singe of...

17:20.414 --> 17:21.666
[Felix] Nice!

17:22.625 --> 17:25.545
Guys, I have a genius,
original, unique idea.

17:25.628 --> 17:27.630
Let's do the wave. I'll start.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.465
Yes!

17:30.508 --> 17:31.884
[Lisa] Again!

17:31.968 --> 17:34.929
Let's go!
We're gonna miss sunset on the bay!

17:35.012 --> 17:36.347
Here we go! Alright!

17:36.430 --> 17:37.265
[all groan]

17:37.348 --> 17:39.308
Come on, guys, let's go to the sunset!

17:39.392 --> 17:41.852
-Oh, my God, you broke the chair!
-What the hell?

17:41.936 --> 17:43.938
You totally just broke the chair.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.065
-I'm sorry.
-I'm hungry. Let's go eat.

17:46.148 --> 17:49.944
No, see, but sunset on the bay
has to happen at sunset.

17:50.027 --> 17:53.197
The sun's gonna set here, too,
so we'll just do sunset here.

17:53.281 --> 17:56.534
Don't be ridiculous.
We can't do that because it is not...

17:56.617 --> 17:59.662
[all] ...sunset on the bay.

18:01.289 --> 18:03.874
You guys, I'm hungry, too.
I want McDonald's.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.586
I want a Big Mac

18:06.669 --> 18:08.296
and a large fry

18:08.379 --> 18:10.256
and a McFlurry.

18:10.339 --> 18:11.465
I love that idea.

18:11.549 --> 18:14.385
[in hysterical high voice]
Nobody's going to McDonald's! Alright?

18:15.011 --> 18:16.846
It's not our plan!

18:17.471 --> 18:19.849
Our plan? It's not...

18:19.932 --> 18:23.811
It's not our plan!
Don't call it our plan.

18:24.562 --> 18:26.397
[Ethan] It is our plan.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.733
Does anybody wanna come
and see me perform

18:28.816 --> 18:30.610
in my Whitesnake cover band this weekend?

18:30.693 --> 18:32.069
-[Sam] Yes.
-We're pretty good.

18:32.153 --> 18:33.654
-[Max] I do.
-[Sam] Yes.

18:34.405 --> 18:37.950
-Where are you going?
-To McDonald's! And don't try to stop me!

18:38.034 --> 18:39.493
I'm not trying to stop you.

18:39.577 --> 18:41.787
Well, they're circling the drain.

18:41.871 --> 18:43.205
[Max] Yeah, it looks bad, right?

18:43.748 --> 18:44.790
That's not good.

18:45.499 --> 18:46.959
Lisa, come back!

18:48.711 --> 18:50.212
Come here, now! Stop!

18:50.296 --> 18:52.923
-Lisa, please!
-I'm going to McDonald's!

18:53.758 --> 18:55.051
Just come here!

18:55.593 --> 18:57.428
Come on, this is stupid!

18:58.137 --> 18:59.430
Let's go!

19:00.264 --> 19:02.892
-I see you!
-No, you don't.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.685
-Stay there.
-No, I won't.

19:04.769 --> 19:05.853
Lisa.

19:09.565 --> 19:10.941
Lisa!

19:15.821 --> 19:17.114
Lisa!

19:20.493 --> 19:21.494
Lisa!

19:23.037 --> 19:23.996
Go away!

19:25.456 --> 19:26.540
Lisa!

19:29.877 --> 19:31.545
I gotta get out of here!

19:32.129 --> 19:33.714
[yells] Let me out of here!

19:38.886 --> 19:40.346
There you are!

19:44.392 --> 19:45.976
Too many doors.

19:53.067 --> 19:55.444
[engine whirrs]

19:57.196 --> 19:58.823
Come on, Lisa!

19:59.990 --> 20:02.159
-Lisa, where are you?
-Get off! Get off!

20:02.243 --> 20:04.370
I fell asleep.

20:04.453 --> 20:06.622
Okay, hold on one second, sir. I'm sorry.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.499
-You can't be in here.
-I'm sorry.

20:08.582 --> 20:10.418
-I know.
-Can we please have a moment?

20:10.501 --> 20:13.003
-Be gone by the time I'm back.
-You got it, alright.

20:14.088 --> 20:15.381
I got it.

20:15.464 --> 20:17.842
-Are you sure you don't need help?
-I don't...

20:17.925 --> 20:20.010
Why are you running away from me?

20:20.094 --> 20:22.054
I don't wanna be here anymore.

20:22.138 --> 20:24.056
This is all for you, okay?

20:24.140 --> 20:26.642
Everybody was trying to help
and I'm trying to help.

20:26.726 --> 20:29.103
There's only one thing
that's gonna help me!

20:29.186 --> 20:30.438
Well, what is that?

20:30.521 --> 20:32.148
Having a baby!

20:32.231 --> 20:35.651
Come on, honey, that's not a fair
position, okay? Do you understand?

20:35.735 --> 20:38.863
What are we gonna do,
just be miserable until it happens?

20:38.946 --> 20:41.073
I wanted to stay home!

20:41.574 --> 20:45.244
I wanted to stay home and watch movies
and I wanted to sleep.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.622
Why can't you be in this with me?

20:48.706 --> 20:51.500
-I am in this with you!
-Why am I sad and you're not sad?

20:51.584 --> 20:53.627
I am sad, too.

20:54.295 --> 20:56.630
I don't wanna be alone in this.

20:56.714 --> 20:58.924
Honey, you're not alone in this.

21:00.009 --> 21:04.138
If we could co-have a baby,
then we would, but we can't.

21:04.555 --> 21:07.349
And apparently,
we can't co-lose one, either.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.894
I do not know what to do for you.

21:09.977 --> 21:14.732
You know, I'm having a hard time
with this conversation with these glasses.

21:14.815 --> 21:17.401
I mean, you look like Prince
and it's distracting.

21:17.485 --> 21:20.196
Okay, alright.
Well, then, is that easier for you?

21:20.821 --> 21:22.156
Oh, my God!

21:25.242 --> 21:26.118
What did...

21:27.161 --> 21:28.496
Are you okay?

21:31.791 --> 21:32.917
[Nick] Again.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.461
[all cheer]

21:37.338 --> 21:40.257
-That was amazing!
-You guys wanna see something cool?

21:40.341 --> 21:42.635
Yeah, we do. Let's see it, buddy boy.

21:45.262 --> 21:46.931
[Marianne] What am I looking at right now?

21:47.014 --> 21:48.682
That's me getting a hummer.

21:51.101 --> 21:52.728
Next round's on me.

21:57.066 --> 21:59.443
Hey! What are you drinking?

21:59.902 --> 22:02.780
Red, white, dry or sweet?

22:03.405 --> 22:05.699
Just kidding. All they have is sweet.

22:07.868 --> 22:08.953
Oh, no.

22:10.037 --> 22:11.163
Erm...

22:11.914 --> 22:15.376
I'm gonna... I'll see you
at the hotel thing tomorrow, right?

22:16.168 --> 22:19.755
I've been thinking maybe I should take
a little step back for a while.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.590
No!

22:21.674 --> 22:24.593
It just seems like
you've got your hands full right now.

22:24.677 --> 22:28.347
I mean, I do, but, you know,
I still love to...

22:29.431 --> 22:30.599
Hey...

22:36.772 --> 22:38.399
Oh, fuck you.

22:38.482 --> 22:40.776
It is like drinking a Cinnabon.

22:40.859 --> 22:43.279
Are we just drinking simple syrup?

22:43.737 --> 22:44.822
Is that what it is?

22:45.489 --> 22:47.616
You guys have a driver, right?
You're okay?

22:47.700 --> 22:49.952
We definitely have a driver.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.453
[snores]

22:52.621 --> 22:53.831
What do we do?

22:54.415 --> 22:56.875
-I'll drive. I only had white.
-Sweet.

23:11.140 --> 23:13.350
Hey. Is your eye okay?

23:14.018 --> 23:17.104
-Do you wanna stop and get some drops?
-No, it's fine.

23:17.187 --> 23:20.649
This does not have responsive steering.
Why are the back roads so busy?

23:20.733 --> 23:24.194
No, you're gonna have to get on the
highway so we can get back to the city.

23:24.278 --> 23:27.656
No, Ethan, wait!
What about sunset on the bay?

23:27.740 --> 23:30.075
Tell me we're gonna make it
to sunset on the bay.

23:30.159 --> 23:32.703
-[Max] We gotta make it.
-[Nick] Please say we're gonna make it.

23:32.786 --> 23:36.290
-It's supposed to cure cancer!
-It's supposed to put hair on your head!

23:36.373 --> 23:39.543
[Sam] Ethan, I've heard it's sweeter
than a champagne bidet.

23:39.627 --> 23:42.921
I heard that sunset on the bay
is like a three-hour orgasm.

23:43.005 --> 23:45.132
[angrily] Hey, Marianne, shut up, okay?

23:45.215 --> 23:49.094
Ethan did not have to do all of this,
he did this because he loves us!

23:49.178 --> 23:52.890
And if you're not gonna be helpful,
then you shut up, Marianne!

23:52.973 --> 23:55.517
-Shut up, Marianne! One too far!
-[Sam] Yeah, shut up!

23:55.601 --> 23:57.519
[Max] It's that time, Marianne!

23:57.603 --> 23:59.521
Marianne, will you clear that bridge?

24:01.607 --> 24:04.068
Seriously,
are you gonna clear that bridge, babe?

24:04.735 --> 24:06.779
Seriously, are you gonna clear that...

24:06.862 --> 24:08.155
-Marianne, no!
-Stop!

24:15.871 --> 24:17.081
[Marianne] Sorry.

24:17.748 --> 24:20.084
I was mad because I was singled out

24:20.167 --> 24:22.711
for something everyone else was doing.

24:22.795 --> 24:24.880
I think everyone
should've been yelled at.

24:26.840 --> 24:27.925
Shit!

24:28.550 --> 24:30.803
How does it look? What's the damage?

24:30.886 --> 24:33.847
[Nick] I don't know, the vent has been
knocked off, and the antenna,

24:33.931 --> 24:36.850
and the AC unit has gone completely,
but otherwise...

24:36.934 --> 24:39.645
Everybody... change of plans.

24:40.688 --> 24:42.356
Change of plans.

24:44.775 --> 24:46.110
[laughter]

24:46.193 --> 24:48.195
-This is so good, guys.
-So good.

24:48.278 --> 24:51.115
-This is really good.
-This is like heaven.

24:51.198 --> 24:52.157
Oh, man.

24:53.033 --> 24:54.201
Oh, my God.

24:54.284 --> 24:55.744
To sunset in the parking lot!

24:55.828 --> 24:58.497
Sunset in the parking lot!

25:00.374 --> 25:02.292
I need more food in my belly.

25:02.376 --> 25:03.836
Does anybody want anything?

25:03.919 --> 25:05.087
Large fries.

25:05.879 --> 25:07.840
Alright. I need cash. I have no money.

25:07.923 --> 25:12.052
I got nothing. I'm saving my singles
for Felix's pole-lates.

25:17.808 --> 25:20.519
Does anyone know where...
where Felix went?

25:21.270 --> 25:23.188
-Have you guys seen...
-[Nick] What?

25:26.650 --> 25:28.026
Where's Felix?

25:28.110 --> 25:31.113
-On the bus.
-[all] Yeah, he's on the bus.

25:31.697 --> 25:32.906
So who wants more fries?

25:32.990 --> 25:35.617
-Get three orders of fries.
-He's not on the bus.

25:35.701 --> 25:37.745
-He's not on the bus.
-[Lisa] Did he...

25:37.828 --> 25:40.372
No, he's not in there!
He's not on the bus!

25:40.456 --> 25:43.292
He's not there, he's not on the bus.
He's not...

25:44.501 --> 25:46.253
He's not in there!

25:46.336 --> 25:47.838
Felix!

25:47.921 --> 25:49.089
He's not...

25:49.173 --> 25:51.592
I don't see him in there
and he's not on the bus.

25:51.675 --> 25:53.469
He's not in the bus, guys!

25:53.552 --> 25:54.803
He's not on the bus!

25:55.554 --> 25:56.513
He's not on the bus!

26:04.646 --> 26:05.481
Felix!

26:07.065 --> 26:08.150
Felix!

26:08.233 --> 26:11.069
I'm so glad you're here. I'm so sorry.

26:11.153 --> 26:13.614
I'm sorry. I apologize.

26:13.697 --> 26:15.949
-You left me here.
-I know. I really...

26:16.033 --> 26:19.870
We were gone and I looked around and
I was like, "Oh, my God, where's Felix?"

26:19.953 --> 26:21.371
You didn't even text me.

26:21.455 --> 26:22.915
I tried. There was dead zones.

26:22.998 --> 26:25.876
-There was dead zones. For real.
-Why didn't you come back?

26:25.959 --> 26:28.128
I did! The second I saw, I was, like...

26:28.212 --> 26:29.421
You didn't come back.

26:29.505 --> 26:31.882
You left me here for 90 minutes!

26:31.965 --> 26:34.218
I didn't notice that one guy
was in a big bus

26:34.301 --> 26:37.638
and you didn't notice
that there was a big bus... leaving.

26:37.721 --> 26:40.307
Now you're blaming me,
you fucking asshole?

26:40.390 --> 26:41.975
I feel like the point is...

26:42.851 --> 26:44.186
The second I saw,

26:44.269 --> 26:47.147
oh, my God, Felix isn't here,
I was like, "We gotta get him,"

26:47.231 --> 26:51.276
and everyone was like, "Yeah, 100%,
let's go get Felix, absolutely."

26:51.360 --> 26:53.737
They were cool with coming to get me?
That's so nice.

26:53.821 --> 26:55.864
100%. They were really on board.

26:57.032 --> 26:58.909
I would notice if you weren't there...

26:59.493 --> 27:00.911
for 45 minutes.

27:04.164 --> 27:06.083
I think we should take some time off.

27:07.626 --> 27:09.086
Oh, no.

27:09.169 --> 27:10.087
No.

27:10.170 --> 27:13.632
You're a different person around them.
I don't know who that person is.

27:15.676 --> 27:17.553
And I don't really like that person.

27:20.180 --> 27:22.516
You guys are stuck
in some 20-year time warp.

27:23.392 --> 27:24.977
It's fucking pathetic.

27:27.521 --> 27:30.315
-Did he just say we...
-[Ethan] Nick, be quiet.

27:35.195 --> 27:36.363
Shit, they're coming.

27:43.537 --> 27:44.663
Hey, man.

28:02.306 --> 28:03.599
You okay, buddy?

28:04.892 --> 28:05.976
Not really.

28:28.123 --> 28:29.833
Someone talk to me.

28:29.917 --> 28:31.627
I'm really tired.

28:36.965 --> 28:37.966
No!

28:38.050 --> 28:38.967
No!

28:39.051 --> 28:40.677
Get off me! No!

28:40.761 --> 28:42.763
[Nick] Joe. You're sleeping.

28:58.111 --> 28:59.279
Ethan?
