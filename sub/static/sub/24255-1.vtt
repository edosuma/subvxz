00:39.106 --> 00:42.687
Most definitely,
it's just a real long road.

00:42.689 --> 00:43.904
It's a really
fucking long road.

00:43.906 --> 00:46.210
- It's really far out, isn't it?
- Yeah.

00:46.721 --> 00:48.287
It's nice though.

00:48.289 --> 00:49.503
I couldn't live down here.

00:49.505 --> 00:52.030
No way. I want to stay
in the city.

00:52.032 --> 00:53.568
Yeah.

00:53.570 --> 00:55.936
Ger's been sleeping
the whole time, has he?

00:55.938 --> 00:57.152
- Is he still asleep?
- Yeah.

00:57.154 --> 00:58.115
Leave him at it.

01:00.321 --> 01:02.754
Hopefully the
weekend will do him good.

01:03.970 --> 01:05.632
- Is this it?
- Yeah.

01:05.634 --> 01:07.391
Oh, my God,
is that a...

01:07.393 --> 01:08.447
It is.

01:09.665 --> 01:11.230
It's gorgeous.

01:11.232 --> 01:12.383
Oh, look.

01:12.385 --> 01:13.731
This is nice!

01:17.634 --> 01:19.423
Will you promise
to behave yourself?

01:19.425 --> 01:22.015
Yeah, I'll do my best.

01:22.017 --> 01:23.231
Just don't drink so much.

01:23.233 --> 01:26.272
The country is the place for mischief.
I'm a mischievous guy!

01:27.553 --> 01:29.823
I don't want to go
against my nature.

01:29.825 --> 01:31.359
There they are.

01:31.361 --> 01:32.322
Looking well.

01:36.833 --> 01:38.305
Jesus Christ, lads!

01:39.265 --> 01:40.898
What the hell
is that smell, huh?

01:41.634 --> 01:42.913
It's getting worse.

01:47.329 --> 01:49.567
- Hi!
- Hi. How are you?

01:49.569 --> 01:51.168
Lovely to see you.

01:51.170 --> 01:52.609
You missed the news so.

01:53.442 --> 01:54.336
Hello!

01:54.338 --> 01:57.662
Oh, come here, guys,
the place looks amazing!

01:57.664 --> 02:00.159
It's in the middle of nowhere,
it's so isolated.

02:00.161 --> 02:01.598
You could get up to anything.

02:01.600 --> 02:03.456
As usual the two of you
look impeccable.

02:03.458 --> 02:04.478
Thank you.

02:04.480 --> 02:06.944
But the stink is really bad.

02:06.946 --> 02:08.895
Seriously,
what is that stench?

02:08.898 --> 02:10.751
Is there a pig farm near by?

02:10.752 --> 02:12.639
It's a sinkhole.

02:12.641 --> 02:14.113
It was all over the news.

02:15.201 --> 02:16.162
What, you're not serious?

02:16.769 --> 02:18.430
Yeah.

02:18.432 --> 02:20.416
Hi, how are you?

02:20.418 --> 02:23.327
- So this is the famous holiday home.
- Yeah.

02:23.329 --> 02:24.290
It's nice.

02:25.505 --> 02:28.159
Listen, I'm sorry
to hear about Barbara.

02:28.161 --> 02:30.113
- How are you holding up?
- Yeah, well...

02:31.138 --> 02:32.099
Fine I suppose.

02:33.280 --> 02:35.873
It ran it's course.
Or so she said.

02:38.593 --> 02:40.544
Well, I'm glad
you could make it.

02:40.546 --> 02:41.823
Me too.

02:41.825 --> 02:44.479
Even if it does
stink down here.

02:44.481 --> 02:45.535
Oh, God.

02:45.537 --> 02:46.528
It's typical.

02:46.530 --> 02:49.376
The one weekend I manage
to get everybody here.

02:49.378 --> 02:50.655
You're not serious, though.

02:50.657 --> 02:52.191
It's beyond the woods.

02:52.193 --> 02:54.431
It's over by the old mines
on the mountain.

02:54.433 --> 02:55.455
We should go take a look.

02:55.457 --> 02:56.512
How far away?

02:56.514 --> 02:57.344
It's far

02:57.346 --> 02:59.966
and people
aren't allowed near it.

02:59.968 --> 03:02.528
It's burning hot, and that
smell that you're getting

03:02.530 --> 03:03.616
that's sulfur.

03:03.618 --> 03:06.945
They say coal spontaneously
combusted or something.

03:07.874 --> 03:09.570
We'll make the most of it.

03:10.721 --> 03:12.446
We'll stay indoors.

03:12.448 --> 03:13.598
Have you been up there?

03:13.600 --> 03:14.974
God no.

03:14.976 --> 03:18.432
If it stinks that bad two miles
away, it must be pungent near it.

03:18.434 --> 03:23.103
Peter the sergeant told us his crowd have
the whole place sealed off. For safety.

03:23.105 --> 03:26.880
Apparently it's actually
over 800 degrees there.

03:26.882 --> 03:28.063
Jesus.

03:28.065 --> 03:29.662
Yeah, I know.

03:29.664 --> 03:31.872
They're calling it
the gates of hell!

03:32.866 --> 03:35.200
Now I really have to go
take a look now.

03:35.202 --> 03:36.575
We should head inside.

03:36.577 --> 03:38.431
That stink is nauseating.

03:38.433 --> 03:40.256
Yeah, yeah.

03:40.258 --> 03:41.312
I'll just grab some bags.

03:41.314 --> 03:42.275
I'll give you a hand.

03:47.201 --> 03:49.858
Okay you guys are in here.

03:51.618 --> 03:53.918
Oh, wow, it's gorgeous,
thank you so much.

03:53.920 --> 03:54.782
I need a beer.

03:54.784 --> 03:57.470
Oh, well, then
I'll follow you down.

03:57.472 --> 03:58.658
Ger, you're in the box room.

04:01.377 --> 04:03.647
I know it's small.
I hope you don't mind.

04:03.649 --> 04:05.857
No. I can sleep anywhere.

04:07.586 --> 04:09.182
Come down
when you're ready, okay?

04:09.184 --> 04:10.177
Thanks.

04:22.242 --> 04:23.487
Hey man, want one?

04:23.489 --> 04:24.450
Sure, beer me.

04:34.144 --> 04:35.201
I tell you,

04:37.088 --> 04:39.646
with that stink
and the road closures

04:39.648 --> 04:41.599
we could be in the house a lot

04:41.601 --> 04:42.847
As long as there's
plenty of this,

04:42.849 --> 04:44.862
I don't really give a shit.

04:44.864 --> 04:46.559
Finally. Friday night, eh?

04:46.561 --> 04:47.746
- Friday night.
- Friday night.

04:50.176 --> 04:51.262
- Mm.
- It's nice.

04:51.264 --> 04:52.354
- Yeah, it's good.
- Strong.

05:17.089 --> 05:18.402
It's nice though. It's nice.

05:20.001 --> 05:21.472
I suppose it's better than
being outside anyway.

05:21.474 --> 05:23.166
I know.

05:23.168 --> 05:24.831
I was just thinking

05:24.833 --> 05:27.714
when was the last time we were
properly proper drinking together?

05:30.721 --> 05:32.863
At Barry's...

05:32.865 --> 05:36.254
Barry had a party
about a year ago, was it?

05:36.256 --> 05:37.728
It's not that long,
it can't be that long ago.

05:37.730 --> 05:40.542
It was a year and a half ago
or something.

05:40.544 --> 05:41.568
Down on that island?

05:41.570 --> 05:43.103
Yeah, down the island.

05:43.105 --> 05:46.271
It was his fucking stag it was!

05:46.273 --> 05:47.744
I haven't thought about
that in so long, man.

05:47.746 --> 05:51.488
- We were on those banana boats and it was during the day...
- It was crazy.

05:51.490 --> 05:54.079
...and we were drinking
because we hired a boat.

05:54.081 --> 05:56.927
All those little inflatable
things were cool as well.

05:56.929 --> 05:58.239
It didn't help being drunk

05:58.241 --> 06:01.567
and the fact it was daytime and
there were kids there as well

06:01.569 --> 06:04.991
and we were running knocking
kids left, right and center!

06:04.993 --> 06:07.135
Ah, he's terrible.
He's so innocent though.

06:07.137 --> 06:08.737
That was a good boat trip.

06:15.521 --> 06:16.670
Is someone living up there?

06:16.672 --> 06:17.696
Not anymore!

06:19.778 --> 06:21.502
There are a couple of houses
around, aren't there?

06:21.504 --> 06:24.351
Yeah, but, well, I think, we
are kinda, the closest really.

06:24.353 --> 06:25.215
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:25.217 --> 06:27.070
Because it's up
near the old mines.

06:27.072 --> 06:29.472
Yeah, it's fairly, that, like...

06:29.474 --> 06:32.414
The only people that go up
there are kids messing about.

06:32.416 --> 06:35.422
So does it open at night
or in the morning?

06:35.424 --> 06:37.342
What do you mean?
It's not an amusement park!

06:37.344 --> 06:39.072
It doesn't have opening hours!

06:40.065 --> 06:43.071
Can we go overnight?
Can we go in the morning?

06:43.073 --> 06:44.770
Did you see the peak times?

06:46.465 --> 06:47.521
That'll be the lads.

06:51.520 --> 06:53.598
Hi! Welcome!

06:53.600 --> 06:54.879
Good to see you.

06:54.881 --> 06:56.415
- You look great!
- So do you.

06:56.417 --> 06:57.855
- Hi, Marissa, nice to see you.
- Hi, how are you?

06:57.857 --> 06:59.039
I'm so sorry we're late.

06:59.041 --> 07:00.929
No, not at all,
you're grand.

07:03.201 --> 07:04.544
Will you come in
and shut the door!

07:04.546 --> 07:05.825
That stink
is getting everywhere!

07:10.881 --> 07:12.638
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:16.322 --> 07:18.366
So what's with the smell?

07:18.368 --> 07:19.391
Oh, yeah.

07:19.393 --> 07:22.846
The devil farted and blew open
the gates of hell.

07:22.848 --> 07:26.559
No, it's a sinkhole up in the mountain.
It's all sulfur.

07:26.561 --> 07:29.504
A sinkhole? Those things
really freak me out.

07:29.506 --> 07:31.839
That's one thing I hate about
the countryside.

07:31.841 --> 07:35.422
All this talk about remote
working, it's bullshit.

07:35.424 --> 07:36.798
Reception here is brutal.

07:36.800 --> 07:39.294
Stop being so rude, we're only
just in the door.

07:39.296 --> 07:41.151
I just need to check my
voicemail, I missed a call.

07:41.153 --> 07:43.230
The reception here
is really bad.

07:43.232 --> 07:45.374
It's part of the charm
of the place.

07:45.376 --> 07:48.766
It's one of the reasons
we come up here.

07:48.768 --> 07:52.671
But if you really want it, if go
down to the end of the garden,

07:52.673 --> 07:53.729
you'll get some there.

07:54.529 --> 07:55.679
I'll be back in a minute.

07:55.681 --> 07:57.600
Jeez, can't you not stay off
the thing for five minutes?

07:57.602 --> 07:58.718
We're only in the door.

07:58.720 --> 08:00.767
I'll be quick honey.
I promise, okay?

08:00.769 --> 08:02.562
Just this last thing and
then we can start drinking.

08:05.057 --> 08:08.194
He's actually never off that thing.
He's like a teenager.

08:10.786 --> 08:12.322
Do you want coffee?
Wine? Beer?

08:13.121 --> 08:15.038
Coffee. Thanks.

08:15.040 --> 08:18.912
Sorry we're late. I'm lucky I
got Ray out the door at all.

08:51.296 --> 08:52.961
I could stay here all day.

08:55.072 --> 08:56.322
It's a lovely getaway.

08:57.793 --> 08:59.136
And it smells nice in here.

08:59.138 --> 09:00.226
Yeah.

09:01.697 --> 09:03.102
That's all.
I'm a trip adviser.

09:05.825 --> 09:07.841
That smell is rank.

09:09.888 --> 09:10.849
That's better.

09:12.449 --> 09:15.326
The church missed a trick
focusing on fire and brimstone.

09:15.328 --> 09:16.607
That smell is way worse.

09:16.609 --> 09:19.199
Use the toilet after a man loaded
up on Guinness and gherkins

09:19.201 --> 09:21.182
that'll be sure to make you
change your ways.

09:21.184 --> 09:23.167
There's no need
to bring that up again.

09:23.169 --> 09:24.674
There's never a bad
time to bring that up.

09:26.241 --> 09:29.951
So I guess there's no
outdoor activities this weekend.

09:29.953 --> 09:32.513
Is your modem on by the way?
I couldn't get a connection.

09:33.024 --> 09:34.304
There's no modem.

09:34.306 --> 09:35.550
There's no internet.

09:35.552 --> 09:38.048
That's the whole point
of this place.

09:38.050 --> 09:39.425
Oh fuck, you're not serious?

09:40.225 --> 09:41.438
You said they have internet!

09:41.440 --> 09:42.622
I said I'm sure they have.

09:42.624 --> 09:45.026
I asked you to check! You
know I have to be connected!

09:45.985 --> 09:47.039
Work has been a bit...

09:47.041 --> 09:50.623
Can you not just stay off
that thing for one weekend?

09:50.625 --> 09:52.031
We're here to have fun
with our friends!

09:52.033 --> 09:55.006
I'm sure they can get by in work
without you for a couple of days!

09:55.008 --> 09:57.022
Some of us have important work
to do, you know?

09:57.024 --> 10:00.447
We don't just sit around
all day writing articles.

10:00.449 --> 10:01.985
Stop being such a cock.

10:04.704 --> 10:06.079
You are such a cock!

10:21.824 --> 10:23.810
He's looking for matches!

10:28.449 --> 10:30.270
How far away is that thing?

10:30.272 --> 10:31.998
- What thing?
- The...

10:32.000 --> 10:33.022
Oh, the hole!

10:33.024 --> 10:35.198
Um, it's about
two miles, I think.

10:35.200 --> 10:36.704
It's on the side
of the mountain.

10:37.089 --> 10:39.263
Is it dangerous?

10:39.265 --> 10:41.470
No, I don't think so.

10:41.472 --> 10:43.424
Otherwise, Pete would have
told us to get out.

10:44.832 --> 10:48.255
The chief superintendent is down
with him for the next few days

10:48.257 --> 10:51.618
helping him deal with the
press and the road blocks.

10:52.641 --> 10:54.526
Don't look so worried.

10:54.528 --> 10:56.478
It's okay.
It's not that big at all.

10:56.480 --> 10:58.782
They're just looking for
something to fill up the news.

10:58.784 --> 11:00.769
Yeah, but what about
the fumes...

11:02.049 --> 11:04.801
The fumes... No worse
than the fumes in the city.

11:05.889 --> 11:06.849
I suppose.

11:08.928 --> 11:10.400
Anyone fancy a smoke?

11:11.233 --> 11:12.831
Nice one.

11:12.833 --> 11:14.559
But we'll have
to smoke it outside.

11:14.561 --> 11:16.031
For fuck's sake!

11:16.033 --> 11:17.119
House rules.

11:17.121 --> 11:18.879
It's your fucking house!

11:18.881 --> 11:21.439
It's Marissa's father's place,
and come on,

11:21.441 --> 11:22.722
he doesn't want
smoking in here.

11:23.360 --> 11:24.321
Let's go.

11:39.649 --> 11:41.889
I might make a quick call.

11:44.769 --> 11:45.729
For fuck's sake.

11:53.984 --> 11:55.327
Aww.

11:55.329 --> 11:57.855
They're splashing him with water
constantly, and then he goes,

11:57.857 --> 12:01.791
"Mr Fungi?" And he's there
dead on the ground.

12:01.793 --> 12:05.407
Did they not have the animal rights
people coming down about that?

12:05.409 --> 12:06.846
- About fungi?
- Yeah.

12:06.848 --> 12:09.918
He was like, "Can I get
a smoke there please?"

12:09.920 --> 12:12.734
I mean, those guys, they
watch him like a hawk.

12:12.736 --> 12:15.198
This is a cartoon fungi,
it's not real fungi!

12:15.200 --> 12:16.958
Yeah, it's not, like, real.

12:16.960 --> 12:18.494
- Oh.
- What?

12:18.496 --> 12:20.609
- Real fungi was gonna...
- Yeah, yeah. Sorry, yeah.

12:21.953 --> 12:23.454
I knew that.
I knew that.

12:23.456 --> 12:25.119
I didn't know you smoked.

12:25.121 --> 12:26.399
- I don't.
- Oh.

12:26.401 --> 12:27.361
- No, I don't.
- You don't.

12:31.872 --> 12:32.894
Are you okay?

12:32.896 --> 12:34.014
Yeah, fine.

12:34.016 --> 12:35.070
Are you sure?

12:35.072 --> 12:36.095
Yeah, I'm fine.

12:36.097 --> 12:37.214
Did you have enough to eat?

12:37.216 --> 12:39.870
I did, yeah.
It was lovely, thank you.

12:39.872 --> 12:42.943
You're very welcome.
Did you like my lasagna?

12:42.945 --> 12:43.967
I loved it.

12:46.465 --> 12:48.672
Working hard in the kitchen.
Go all day flat.

12:49.664 --> 12:51.103
It was lovely.

12:51.105 --> 12:52.450
I haven't ever had one before.

12:53.344 --> 12:55.903
You're really quiet today.

12:55.905 --> 12:57.726
I'm fine. I'm just tired.

12:57.728 --> 12:59.039
Over the last few weeks,
you know?

12:59.041 --> 13:00.738
I haven't been getting
great sleep and stuff.

13:01.633 --> 13:02.783
Are you sure that's all?

13:02.785 --> 13:04.734
Yeah. That's it.

13:04.736 --> 13:06.078
What else would it be?

13:06.080 --> 13:08.318
Well, come on, I mean,
you've been through a lot.

13:08.320 --> 13:09.886
- Yeah.
- You know?

13:09.888 --> 13:11.679
It's just a bit, you know,

13:11.681 --> 13:14.750
first time being around
you all again without her.

13:14.752 --> 13:16.098
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:19.168 --> 13:21.182
Right, that's it. I can't
handle that smell anymore.

13:21.184 --> 13:22.784
It's giving me a headache.
I'm going in.

13:27.809 --> 13:29.150
Where are you going?

13:29.152 --> 13:31.745
I'm just checking
if Ray is still out here.

13:32.448 --> 13:33.409
Do you want a knife?

13:33.793 --> 13:34.752
I have one.

13:42.112 --> 13:43.073
Ray?

13:48.225 --> 13:49.185
Ray?

14:12.225 --> 14:13.790
You're so jumpy!

14:13.792 --> 14:15.007
Ray's in the house.

14:15.009 --> 14:16.033
Okay.

14:24.640 --> 14:28.254
If you're really good and you go to
heaven, does that mean the gambling...

14:28.256 --> 14:29.567
Where's the gambling
and booze?

14:29.569 --> 14:32.350
Is it in heaven
for being good?

14:32.352 --> 14:34.815
Or is it in hell
for just kind of...

14:34.817 --> 14:36.253
Well, that's where
we all are.

14:36.255 --> 14:38.270
Maybe hell
is everyone's worst nightmare.

14:38.272 --> 14:42.785
Individually. Whatever your
worst nightmare is.

14:43.680 --> 14:44.608
Then you would be...

14:44.610 --> 14:46.813
If your worst,
worst nightmare was spiders

14:46.815 --> 14:50.110
then your hell would be in a
room full of spiders forever.

14:50.112 --> 14:51.967
I'm so scared of
strippers and booze.

14:55.424 --> 14:58.270
Your last
dying thought is like,

14:58.272 --> 15:02.942
"My worst fear is I just
absolutely hate sun holidays!"

15:02.944 --> 15:06.782
That is in some short story,
that that is what hell is

15:06.784 --> 15:09.695
your worst nightmare.
That it is a personal thing.

15:09.697 --> 15:13.790
If we led a really bad life

15:13.792 --> 15:17.022
but at the very last moment...

15:17.024 --> 15:18.397
You become an organ
donor or something.

15:18.399 --> 15:20.030
Yeah, can you redeem yourself
that way?

15:22.368 --> 15:25.054
That's Pascal's wager.

15:25.056 --> 15:27.550
You can just be crap
for your whole life

15:27.552 --> 15:29.504
which I plan on kinda doing.

15:32.960 --> 15:34.622
Would it work
the other way then?

15:34.624 --> 15:37.310
If you were really good,
like, were really,

15:37.312 --> 15:39.135
um, didn't do anything bad

15:39.137 --> 15:42.558
and then at the last moment
you did something awful...

15:42.560 --> 15:43.582
Shot a baby!

15:43.584 --> 15:44.894
- Yeah.
- Oh.

15:46.816 --> 15:49.726
Would all your good stuff
then be, like, forgotten?

15:49.728 --> 15:50.753
No, I don't think so.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.430
They'd weigh it up!

15:54.432 --> 15:56.638
What's the symbol
for the judicial system?

15:56.640 --> 15:58.206
You know, the scales.

15:58.208 --> 16:01.119
Yeah, it's that with, uh,
St. Peter with...

16:06.880 --> 16:10.974
I don't know if it's the food
or the smoke or what

16:10.976 --> 16:13.086
but I am really tired.

16:13.088 --> 16:14.750
I'm going to have to go to bed.

16:14.752 --> 16:17.377
You shouldn't be smoking.
You know how you get.

16:18.753 --> 16:20.001
Why, how do I get?

16:20.608 --> 16:21.729
Like that.

16:54.303 --> 16:56.705
Do you know what would really
liven this place up?

16:57.473 --> 16:58.626
Strip poker.

17:01.153 --> 17:04.030
No way I'm getting
my kit off in front of you.

17:04.031 --> 17:06.016
It's not you I want to see
with your kit off.

17:06.593 --> 17:07.617
Oh, yeah?

17:08.289 --> 17:09.727
In your dreams.

17:09.729 --> 17:13.214
Eye's off my wife,
you pervert.

17:13.215 --> 17:15.105
Don't worry. I only have eyes
for this beauty here.

17:15.743 --> 17:17.472
Oh. Get a room. Jesus.

17:19.936 --> 17:21.374
I'm going to hit the hay.

17:21.376 --> 17:23.201
But, Ger, it's only one!

17:25.280 --> 17:26.301
I'm wrecked.

17:26.304 --> 17:28.639
I'm not used to
social drinking.

17:28.641 --> 17:31.266
You mean, you
normally drink on your own?

17:31.872 --> 17:34.366
I'm only messing!

17:34.368 --> 17:36.481
Well, I'm going to go as well.
I'm wrecked.

17:38.144 --> 17:39.391
- Night.
- Night.

17:39.393 --> 17:41.983
Ooh! Leaving together!

17:41.985 --> 17:43.071
Lucy and Gerny!

17:43.073 --> 17:44.477
Have a nice journey.

17:44.479 --> 17:47.678
We're going to get all hot and
steamy together, aren't we, Ger?

17:49.696 --> 17:51.070
Goodnight.

17:51.072 --> 17:52.479
And enjoy.
See you later.

18:01.536 --> 18:02.656
Oh, hey.

18:04.127 --> 18:07.358
Marissa told me about Barbara.

18:07.360 --> 18:11.647
I'm really sorry, I thought
you guys were great together.

18:11.649 --> 18:14.113
I don't know.
It just wasn't meant to be.

18:17.952 --> 18:21.920
Do you think we end up with the
person we're meant to end up with?

18:25.120 --> 18:26.368
I like to think so.

18:27.136 --> 18:28.097
Yeah.

18:28.575 --> 18:29.536
Me too.

18:30.529 --> 18:32.033
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

18:40.224 --> 18:41.920
For fuck's sake.

19:41.216 --> 19:43.905
And here I thought you guys came
out here to get away from it all.

19:45.152 --> 19:47.006
Should we give Pete a shout?

19:47.008 --> 19:48.286
What good would that do?

19:48.288 --> 19:50.176
They're not local squad cars.

19:52.157 --> 19:52.768
I hate that sound.

19:53.089 --> 19:54.911
Me too.

19:54.913 --> 19:56.833
Well, it wouldn't be much use
if you liked it.

19:57.952 --> 19:59.742
In all the years
we've been coming here,

19:59.744 --> 20:01.598
I don't think
I've ever heard sirens.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.681
But in all those years there's
never been a sinkhole.

20:08.449 --> 20:11.969
What is a sinkhole anyway?
It just opens up...

20:12.992 --> 20:15.101
Yeah, I think.
I don't know.

20:15.103 --> 20:17.565
The landfill or something?
Does it...

20:17.567 --> 20:21.342
There's nothing under it and no one
noticed until someone stepped on it?

20:21.344 --> 20:22.399
How deep is it?

20:22.401 --> 20:23.741
That's what I was wondering,

20:23.743 --> 20:28.158
because if it is some sort of
chemical reaction...

20:28.160 --> 20:29.533
Seeing as I'm not gonna be
able to get any work done,

20:29.535 --> 20:30.848
I might as well
do some damage.

20:31.872 --> 20:32.989
Who's joining me?

20:32.991 --> 20:34.014
That's my cue.

20:34.016 --> 20:35.038
Mine too.

20:35.040 --> 20:36.318
Jesus.

20:36.320 --> 20:38.145
Your wife goes
so you have to go as well?

20:40.063 --> 20:42.589
Don't forget, we've to do
this again tomorrow.

20:42.591 --> 20:45.661
I thought this was a party! Marissa,
will you please, please just...

20:45.663 --> 20:47.645
give your husband permission
to stay up for a few more?

20:47.647 --> 20:50.174
He can do what he likes.
He speaks for himself.

20:50.176 --> 20:51.137
I'm wrecked, man.

20:52.191 --> 20:53.535
You're a lightweight.

20:53.537 --> 20:56.095
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You haven't
been drinking as long as I have.

20:56.097 --> 20:59.134
You got to live for today.
Tomorrow might never come.

20:59.136 --> 21:01.536
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Good night, Mr. Brooks.

21:02.561 --> 21:04.545
At least you two
are still up for it.

21:11.583 --> 21:13.246
Thank you very much,
Mr. Brooks.

21:13.248 --> 21:14.273
Cheers!

21:17.281 --> 21:18.433
That's much better.

21:23.711 --> 21:25.342
Ooh.

21:25.344 --> 21:26.976
- Our little friend here.
- Nice.

22:01.280 --> 22:03.325
I think you're in
the doghouse.

22:03.327 --> 22:05.152
Nah. She's always like that.

22:05.600 --> 22:07.039
Yeah, blame her.

22:07.041 --> 22:08.799
Mmm-mmm.

22:08.801 --> 22:11.357
She likes to sit around
doing nothing.

22:11.359 --> 22:12.768
I can't do that.

23:29.152 --> 23:31.552
I think we should go up
to the stinkhole tomorrow, eh?

23:32.415 --> 23:33.695
I'm not going up there.

23:33.697 --> 23:35.549
Why not? I mean,

23:35.551 --> 23:37.405
when's the next time you're
gonna see something like this?

23:37.407 --> 23:38.430
It could be
once in a lifetime.

23:38.432 --> 23:41.217
I don't I ever need to see
something like that.

23:42.559 --> 23:44.286
Hurry up with that joint,
will you?

23:44.288 --> 23:46.301
The stink is starting
to get to me.

23:46.303 --> 23:47.710
I'm kinda getting used to it.

23:47.712 --> 23:48.705
Fuck off.

23:49.983 --> 23:51.488
No, he's right.
Kill that thing.

23:53.761 --> 23:55.871
Anyway,
I want to go to bed.

23:55.873 --> 23:58.465
All right, lads.
This is getting awkward.

23:59.808 --> 24:01.089
It doesn't have to be.

25:33.472 --> 25:34.559
Baby?

25:34.561 --> 25:35.582
Baby, wake up!

25:35.584 --> 25:36.705
Yeah.

25:37.344 --> 25:38.685
Listen,

25:38.687 --> 25:42.462
I think Ray is sleeping
with Emma and Shane.

25:43.583 --> 25:44.797
Good one.

25:44.799 --> 25:46.365
No, no, no.
I'm not joking.

25:46.367 --> 25:48.157
I saw him
going into their room.

25:48.159 --> 25:49.728
Yeah. I'm tired.

25:50.977 --> 25:53.469
Listen, I listened
at the door.

25:53.471 --> 25:54.911
They were having sex.

25:59.455 --> 26:01.277
They probably...

26:01.279 --> 26:06.045
They probably saw you and
wanted to wind you up.

26:06.047 --> 26:07.105
No, they didn't see me.

26:09.152 --> 26:11.069
Of course, they saw you.

26:11.071 --> 26:14.205
It's just like something
Shane and Emma would do.

26:14.207 --> 26:16.478
No, I'm sure
they didn't see me.

26:16.480 --> 26:17.921
They saw you.
They saw you.

26:20.704 --> 26:21.921
I'm going down again.

26:22.496 --> 26:23.614
Oh...

26:23.616 --> 26:25.501
- Don't be crazy. Come on.
- No, no, no.

26:25.503 --> 26:27.169
It's not crazy.
Okay?

26:28.128 --> 26:30.526
Emma...
She's always been wild.

26:30.528 --> 26:33.118
In college, she was always
getting up to things.

26:33.120 --> 26:36.030
We all did
crazy things in college.

26:36.032 --> 26:38.237
Yeah,
but that's normal crazy.

26:38.239 --> 26:41.661
I'm talking about, like,
getting drunk crazy,

26:41.663 --> 26:42.974
jumping into a fountain crazy.

26:42.976 --> 26:45.312
Emma pushes things.
I know her.

26:47.456 --> 26:48.797
I know her.

26:48.799 --> 26:50.621
Whoa! Come back to bed.
Come on.

26:50.623 --> 26:51.678
No. No.

26:51.680 --> 26:53.057
I'm going to make sure, okay?

26:53.951 --> 26:56.125
Look, this is ridiculous.

26:56.127 --> 26:57.757
They're just messing with you.

26:57.759 --> 26:58.974
But then I'll ask her.

26:58.976 --> 27:01.504
- Now?
- No! Not now! In the morning.

27:02.656 --> 27:04.031
I can see tomorrow's
going to be fun.

27:11.424 --> 27:12.574
Do you think she'll tell you?

27:12.576 --> 27:13.790
No.

27:13.792 --> 27:15.009
But I'll know.

30:05.311 --> 30:06.495
Is anyone out there?

30:08.767 --> 30:09.950
Jason!

30:09.952 --> 30:11.135
Are you all right?

30:12.672 --> 30:13.920
Jason, are you okay, man?

30:16.927 --> 30:18.110
Jason, you need
to come inside.

30:18.112 --> 30:20.513
It's freezing out here.
And it stinks.

30:22.752 --> 30:24.161
You must be pretty
fucking drunk, man...

31:07.999 --> 31:09.280
What did we do?

31:10.752 --> 31:12.318
You don't remember?

31:12.320 --> 31:14.432
I remember we said
never with friends.

31:16.384 --> 31:18.622
I need a coffee.
Do you want one?

31:18.624 --> 31:20.289
No, I don't want a coffee.

31:21.088 --> 31:22.080
Shit!

31:23.328 --> 31:25.790
How are we going
to face them now?

31:25.792 --> 31:27.678
The same way
we always face them.

31:27.680 --> 31:28.769
They don't know anything.

31:30.816 --> 31:32.477
What about Ray?

31:32.479 --> 31:33.920
He's not going
to say anything.

31:34.496 --> 31:36.161
Oh, fuck!

31:42.528 --> 31:45.246
Don't worry. Okay?

31:45.248 --> 31:46.913
Just forget about it.

31:49.119 --> 31:50.720
We'll pretend
it didn't happen.

32:01.631 --> 32:03.516
Oh. I'm so sorry.
Did I wake you?

32:03.518 --> 32:05.054
No. I'm...

32:05.056 --> 32:06.304
Did you see Ray?

32:06.943 --> 32:08.829
Um... No.

32:08.831 --> 32:09.917
Is he not with you?

32:09.919 --> 32:11.292
No.

32:11.294 --> 32:13.248
I don't think he came
to bed last night.

32:13.951 --> 32:15.870
- Really?
- Hmm.

32:15.872 --> 32:17.629
Well, actually
I can't be too sure.

32:17.631 --> 32:19.808
That bed is so comfy,
I slept like a corpse.

32:25.439 --> 32:27.582
I thought he might have
fallen asleep out there.

32:27.584 --> 32:28.992
Wouldn't be the first time.

32:29.632 --> 32:31.777
I mean, once he gets drunk.

32:35.231 --> 32:38.045
Jesus! That stink's gotten
way worse today.

32:38.047 --> 32:39.677
Yeah, I know.
Just shut the door.

32:39.679 --> 32:40.703
Oh!

32:41.760 --> 32:43.041
- Morning.
- Where's Ray?

32:44.991 --> 32:46.877
How would I know?

32:46.879 --> 32:47.965
He's not with you now, is he?

32:47.967 --> 32:50.720
No. Was he still up when you
went to bed last night?

32:51.423 --> 32:52.865
Yeah, he was.

32:55.103 --> 32:56.800
And you were
the last to go to bed?

32:57.215 --> 32:58.878
Uh, yep.

32:58.880 --> 33:01.182
Where the fuck is he then?

33:01.184 --> 33:03.645
I don't know. Maybe
he's outside on his phone?

33:03.647 --> 33:06.686
Believe me that's
the first place that I looked.

33:06.688 --> 33:09.565
Was he still drinking
when you went to bed?

33:09.567 --> 33:12.285
Yeah, I suppose. I mean, he
wanted to stay up, you know?

33:12.287 --> 33:13.313
You know how he is.

33:18.495 --> 33:20.097
Is your car outside?

33:30.879 --> 33:32.608
You fucking prick.

33:50.976 --> 33:51.936
What is it?

33:52.576 --> 33:53.537
Work.

33:54.464 --> 33:55.550
It's always work.

33:55.552 --> 33:57.660
He can't leave it alone
just for a couple of days.

33:57.662 --> 34:00.830
Oh, I'm so sorry, hon.
Come here.

34:00.832 --> 34:02.592
He's just a fucking prick!

34:04.991 --> 34:07.520
Well, I knew what he was like
when I married him.

34:10.688 --> 34:11.904
I hope that's full of tea.

34:12.958 --> 34:13.920
Excellent.

34:15.998 --> 34:16.960
Are you okay?

34:17.888 --> 34:18.849
Ray left.

34:22.206 --> 34:24.670
For work. Sorry.
He left for work

34:26.688 --> 34:27.742
It doesn't matter.

34:27.744 --> 34:30.525
I'm really glad that I'm here
with all of you.

34:30.527 --> 34:32.125
Ray can go do what he likes.

34:32.127 --> 34:33.822
I'm going to enjoy myself.

34:36.670 --> 34:39.199
Breakfast is here.

34:40.094 --> 34:41.405
All right!

34:41.407 --> 34:42.750
Perfect timing.

34:42.752 --> 34:44.225
I'm fucking starving.
What did you get, man?

34:46.239 --> 34:48.414
Which is the one
where Roger Moore

34:48.416 --> 34:50.045
is skiing and then he jumps off

34:50.047 --> 34:52.253
with the Union Jack parachute?

34:52.255 --> 34:53.376
Will I give you a hand?

34:54.399 --> 34:55.360
No, I'm fine.

34:58.208 --> 34:59.648
Anyone up for a walk?

35:00.254 --> 35:01.501
Are you joking?

35:01.503 --> 35:04.832
I don't want to ruin breakfast
with lungs full of stinky air.

35:06.495 --> 35:08.796
Come on.
It's not that bad.

35:08.798 --> 35:10.781
You'll get used to it.
It's lovely outside.

35:10.783 --> 35:12.796
Maybe if you're
wearing a gas mask.

35:12.798 --> 35:15.392
I think the smell has gotten
much worse today.

35:16.543 --> 35:17.503
Anyone?

35:18.367 --> 35:19.328
No way.

35:21.438 --> 35:22.399
Not me.

35:23.198 --> 35:24.544
I've too much to do.

35:27.135 --> 35:29.565
Well, I don't know how you can stay
inside all day, even with the smell.

35:29.567 --> 35:30.877
We should go for a drive!

35:30.879 --> 35:33.405
We could go down
to the sea or something!

35:33.407 --> 35:36.221
Sorry to report that
the stink is everywhere.

35:36.223 --> 35:38.301
It's even worse
down in the village.

35:38.303 --> 35:42.140
And we can't go to the sea.
The roads are closed.

35:42.142 --> 35:44.448
Well, we'll just have to make
the most of being here.

35:45.438 --> 35:46.399
Won't we?

35:54.720 --> 35:57.277
Well, I'm going
to walk off that breakfast.

35:57.279 --> 35:58.750
I'll see you lot later.

35:58.752 --> 35:59.837
- Bye.
- Enjoy.

35:59.839 --> 36:01.088
Good luck.

36:35.424 --> 36:38.653
- It's so toasty here.
- It is.

36:38.655 --> 36:41.469
Look at me, I'm all sleepy even
though I slept so well last night.

36:41.471 --> 36:42.368
- Did you?
- Really did.

36:44.479 --> 36:46.334
Did you see him when you
got up this morning?

36:46.336 --> 36:48.221
Who? Ray?

36:48.223 --> 36:49.247
- Mm.
- No.

36:50.302 --> 36:51.645
Was his car there?

36:51.647 --> 36:54.590
Um, I think so, yeah,

36:54.592 --> 36:57.020
but I was tired,
so I'm not sure.

36:57.022 --> 36:59.326
Do you think he spent
the whole night with them?

36:59.328 --> 37:01.023
Oh, come on. I don't
want to think about that.

37:02.303 --> 37:04.508
When are you
going to ask Shane?

37:04.510 --> 37:06.781
What? I'm not
asking Shane anything.

37:06.783 --> 37:08.444
You said you'd ask Emma!

37:08.446 --> 37:11.388
And anyway, I still think
they were messing with you.

37:11.390 --> 37:12.796
No, I know what they did.

37:12.798 --> 37:16.029
Well, you spent long enough
out there listening to them.

37:16.031 --> 37:17.084
I needed to be sure!

37:17.086 --> 37:20.063
And how did listening at
their door for an hour help?

37:21.023 --> 37:22.270
It wasn't an hour.

37:22.272 --> 37:23.648
It was only a few minutes.

37:26.078 --> 37:28.957
Anyway, I think
Ray is feeling guilty

37:28.959 --> 37:31.645
because he can't even
face us this morning.

37:31.647 --> 37:33.917
You saw the note.
He had work.

37:33.919 --> 37:34.876
Work.

37:34.878 --> 37:36.636
Anyway, look,
it's none of our business.

37:36.638 --> 37:38.081
None of our business!

37:40.382 --> 37:41.343
Carry on.

37:42.398 --> 37:43.840
Nothing to see here.

37:44.799 --> 37:46.301
Look, you finish up there.

37:46.303 --> 37:48.189
I'm tired.
I'm going to lie down.

37:48.191 --> 37:49.280
All right.

39:41.662 --> 39:43.359
Isn't it a bit early for that?

39:47.391 --> 39:49.664
It's never too early
for wine and cheese.

39:51.903 --> 39:52.989
- There you go.
- Thanks.

39:52.991 --> 39:54.016
Do I cut?

40:05.471 --> 40:07.231
This weekend was a big mistake.

40:07.999 --> 40:09.756
No, it wasn't.

40:09.758 --> 40:11.165
We've been planning this
for ages.

40:11.167 --> 40:12.606
Yeah.

40:12.608 --> 40:15.773
I didn't expect it
to turn out like this.

40:15.775 --> 40:19.039
Look, we're all here now so
let's just make the most of it.

40:19.615 --> 40:20.704
Yeah.

40:30.879 --> 40:32.000
Take your clothes off.

41:32.799 --> 41:34.268
You're starting early.

41:34.270 --> 41:37.213
There's not much else
to do in here.

41:37.215 --> 41:38.560
I'm sure you could
think of something.

41:39.583 --> 41:40.960
What's that supposed to mean?

41:42.175 --> 41:43.136
Um...

41:45.054 --> 41:47.007
You don't even have
a fucking TV.

41:47.775 --> 41:48.829
Marissa's parents...

41:48.831 --> 41:50.976
I know, I know. Relaxing
getaway and all that.

41:51.903 --> 41:52.991
Are you going to join me?

41:53.951 --> 41:54.911
Yeah.

41:58.687 --> 42:01.564
- He does work really hard.
- Mm-hmm.

42:01.566 --> 42:02.685
Like, he's got...

42:02.687 --> 42:06.012
He just really has
a work ethic.

42:06.014 --> 42:09.789
I just wish that he could switch
it off from time to time.

42:09.791 --> 42:11.677
Yeah, but if he's ambitious,
you know...

42:11.679 --> 42:13.021
Yeah.

42:13.023 --> 42:16.669
And it is one of the things
that I love about him.

42:16.671 --> 42:18.557
It's one of the things
I hate about him, too.

42:20.351 --> 42:23.804
He's just always
focused on work,

42:23.806 --> 42:27.069
even if, you know, we have
things planned for the evening,

42:27.071 --> 42:28.348
or just a night
in front of the telly,

42:28.350 --> 42:30.556
he'll always take
the laptop out

42:30.558 --> 42:33.277
and just finds it hard
to switch off.

42:33.279 --> 42:34.752
Have you said it to him?

42:36.255 --> 42:37.276
I think he knows.

42:37.278 --> 42:38.752
- Oh. Thank you.
- Thank you.

42:39.134 --> 42:40.508
But, um,

42:40.510 --> 42:42.045
I don't want to seem...

42:42.047 --> 42:44.445
I know work is really
important to him... Thanks.

42:44.447 --> 42:46.844
You don't want to seem
like you're nagging.

42:46.846 --> 42:48.156
Yeah, exactly.

42:48.158 --> 42:49.375
I think you should
just say it to him.

42:53.375 --> 42:54.941
You should say it
to him because...

42:54.943 --> 42:56.861
That's... Thanks. Jesus.
That's grand, thanks.

42:56.863 --> 42:58.943
Come on, Emma.
You can handle it.

43:01.920 --> 43:04.636
Maybe organize
a holiday or something.

43:04.638 --> 43:07.389
It's really hard for him
to get time off work.

43:07.391 --> 43:10.206
It always used to bother me more
than him that he's working.

43:10.208 --> 43:11.677
Mmm-hmm.

43:11.679 --> 43:13.216
- Who, Ray?
- Yeah.

43:14.335 --> 43:16.540
Just constantly...

43:16.542 --> 43:18.590
I mean,
he really does work hard.

43:18.592 --> 43:20.320
He takes it very seriously.
But he's just...

43:22.847 --> 43:24.191
Be back in two seconds.
Sorry.

43:52.671 --> 43:56.060
I'd love to just ask him just to
get away for a proper holiday.

43:56.062 --> 43:57.469
Ladies.

43:57.471 --> 44:00.348
Shh, we can't talk
about them anymore!

44:00.350 --> 44:01.596
Yeah, yeah.

44:01.598 --> 44:03.996
Say no more now.

44:03.998 --> 44:05.597
Don't worry,
I'm used to that.

44:05.599 --> 44:08.093
Really?

44:08.095 --> 44:09.855
Yeah, he's used to everyone
talking about him.

44:11.103 --> 44:12.092
Yeah, he wish.

44:12.094 --> 44:14.301
I'm just gonna go out
and make a quick call.

44:14.303 --> 44:15.519
I'll just try Ray again.

44:16.799 --> 44:18.141
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

44:18.143 --> 44:19.647
I'll just give him
another try.

45:48.767 --> 45:50.560
There'd be no silence
if there was a TV.

45:51.903 --> 45:53.596
There'd be no talking either.

45:53.598 --> 45:54.784
So much different to now, so.

45:58.303 --> 46:00.063
Look, I'll let you in
on a little secret.

46:01.311 --> 46:02.336
There is a TV.

46:02.623 --> 46:03.708
What?

46:03.710 --> 46:04.957
Marissa hid it away.

46:04.959 --> 46:07.743
The reception is bad, and it
only has the Irish channels.

46:08.350 --> 46:09.917
We could watch a movie!

46:09.919 --> 46:11.615
I have to just plug
my usb key in.

46:13.822 --> 46:15.069
I'll say it to Marissa later.

46:15.071 --> 46:16.765
Yeah.

46:16.767 --> 46:18.525
What's up with Marissa anyway?

46:18.527 --> 46:19.679
She's been acting weird
all morning.

46:20.415 --> 46:21.949
Well...

46:21.951 --> 46:23.455
Babes, I need you
in the bedroom, yeah?

46:25.790 --> 46:27.359
Right. Always in demand.

46:34.815 --> 46:36.764
<i>Hey! You've reached Ray.</i>

46:36.766 --> 46:37.949
<i>Please leave your
name and number</i>

46:37.951 --> 46:39.711
<i>and I'll call you back as
soon as possible. Thank you.</i>

46:41.694 --> 46:43.068
Will you answer your phone?

46:43.070 --> 46:44.928
You'd answer the fucking thing
if it was work!

46:50.175 --> 46:51.260
You're serious?

46:51.262 --> 46:52.508
Yes.

46:52.510 --> 46:53.531
Fuck sake.

46:53.533 --> 46:54.876
We fucked up.

46:54.878 --> 46:56.829
Who fucking leaves
messages on mirrors?

46:56.831 --> 46:59.421
We really fucked up.
What were we thinking?

46:59.423 --> 47:00.861
I'm going to talk
to them fuckers.

47:00.863 --> 47:03.037
No, no, no, you can't, because you
don't know for sure who wrote it.

47:03.039 --> 47:04.060
Yes, I do.

47:04.062 --> 47:05.021
No, you don't.

47:05.023 --> 47:06.909
Yes, she's been
acting weird all morning.

47:06.911 --> 47:08.256
It could have been Jason.

47:08.831 --> 47:09.757
I don't know.

47:09.759 --> 47:11.741
Well, yeah, because
if she knows he knows.

47:11.743 --> 47:12.704
Fuck!

47:17.247 --> 47:18.332
What are you doing?

47:18.334 --> 47:20.124
What does it
look like I'm doing?

47:20.126 --> 47:21.244
Look, we can't...

47:21.246 --> 47:23.007
We can't leave, all right?
They're our friends.

47:24.253 --> 47:27.004
We can't just run away.

47:27.006 --> 47:28.959
Come on, just get
your stuff together.

47:30.142 --> 47:31.038
Where are you going?

47:31.040 --> 47:32.895
I'm going out
for a think, all right?

47:44.798 --> 47:45.821
Jesus Christ!

47:45.823 --> 47:46.783
Dude, relax, will you?

47:53.566 --> 47:54.847
Was that you? The growling?

47:57.407 --> 47:59.229
Have you been
following me all along?

47:59.231 --> 48:00.541
Jesus.

48:00.543 --> 48:03.229
I've better things to do with
my time than follow you around.

48:03.231 --> 48:05.372
What are you doing
all the way out here, then?

48:05.374 --> 48:06.909
All the way out here?

48:06.911 --> 48:07.902
Are you all right?

48:10.974 --> 48:13.054
Just show me the way back to the
house, will you? I can't find it.

48:13.855 --> 48:15.868
Have you been smoking grass?

48:15.870 --> 48:17.439
The house is right over there.

48:22.335 --> 48:24.127
Is this where you've been
for the last few hours?

48:25.439 --> 48:26.399
Hours?

48:28.158 --> 48:31.228
Have you been eating mushrooms
or something? I mean, you know,

48:31.230 --> 48:32.540
because if you have...

48:32.542 --> 48:34.400
Have you been feeling weird
at all since you got here?

48:35.775 --> 48:37.600
Look, nothing's been normal
since we got here.

48:38.814 --> 48:40.476
I mean like, your head?

48:40.478 --> 48:41.501
Headaches?

48:41.503 --> 48:42.685
No.

48:42.687 --> 48:44.316
What are you talking about?

48:44.318 --> 48:45.851
I think there's something
in the air.

48:45.853 --> 48:47.199
You got that right.

48:48.830 --> 48:51.036
We should go back inside.

48:51.038 --> 48:52.637
Yeah, go ahead.
I'll follow you back.

48:52.639 --> 48:54.013
You should come with me.

48:54.015 --> 48:56.411
There's something wrong
out here.

48:56.413 --> 49:00.061
It's not just the smell.
There's something in the air.

49:00.063 --> 49:01.660
That's bullshit, all right?

49:01.662 --> 49:03.484
I got lost and I'm
right beside the house.

49:03.486 --> 49:04.603
If you stay out here
on your own,

49:04.605 --> 49:05.948
something's gonna
happen to you.

49:05.950 --> 49:08.636
Fuck off. Look, the house
is right fucking there!

49:08.638 --> 49:09.599
Not always.

49:15.647 --> 49:16.896
Do you hear that?

49:17.533 --> 49:18.621
What?

49:18.623 --> 49:19.776
Listen.

49:23.230 --> 49:24.733
Oh, come on...

49:28.190 --> 49:29.436
Shit.

49:42.974 --> 49:44.128
Lads, what was that?

49:46.046 --> 49:47.899
Did you see
anything out there?

49:47.901 --> 49:49.661
They said the sinkhole would
likely get bigger.

49:49.663 --> 49:51.548
You need to ring Pete.

49:51.550 --> 49:53.596
Sounds like the gates of hell
just got blown wide open.

49:53.598 --> 49:54.619
Don't say that.

49:54.621 --> 49:55.709
I think we should leave.

49:55.711 --> 49:56.828
We should definitely
stay inside.

49:56.830 --> 49:58.716
There's no need to panic.

49:58.718 --> 50:00.731
I'll ring Pete and see
what the story is, okay?

50:00.733 --> 50:01.759
Yeah.

50:13.950 --> 50:16.508
So much for rest
and the joys of nature.

50:16.510 --> 50:18.972
I've always said it. Nature is
a beast that can't be tamed.

50:18.974 --> 50:20.444
You have
never said that.

50:20.446 --> 50:21.599
I often say that.

50:22.303 --> 50:23.423
How was your walk?

50:24.414 --> 50:25.375
I got lost.

50:26.718 --> 50:28.639
He was outside the back door.

50:30.622 --> 50:33.248
I think there's something
in the air, not just the smell.

50:34.366 --> 50:35.708
Chemicals or something.

50:35.710 --> 50:36.767
Chemicals?

50:37.662 --> 50:38.718
It's all the tea.

50:39.711 --> 50:41.088
That might explain it.

50:42.367 --> 50:43.327
Explain what?

50:44.542 --> 50:45.632
I have a headache.

50:46.431 --> 50:47.486
You're hung over.

50:49.567 --> 50:50.528
Okay.

50:51.391 --> 50:53.213
Pete said to stay put.

50:53.215 --> 50:55.293
There was a gas explosion
up by the old mine.

50:55.295 --> 50:57.117
No one hurt, no damage done.

50:57.119 --> 50:59.099
That didn't sound
like no damage.

50:59.101 --> 51:01.979
Well, the reception was bad but
he did say everything is fine.

51:01.981 --> 51:03.165
I asked him about fumes

51:03.167 --> 51:05.180
and he said the environment
people have already been up there

51:05.182 --> 51:06.496
and gave it the all-clear.

51:11.454 --> 51:15.611
Look, maybe we've just been
drinking and smoking too much, huh?

51:15.613 --> 51:19.004
Let's just pull out the TV and
watch a movie for a while, yeah?

51:19.006 --> 51:20.092
Hang on.

51:20.094 --> 51:21.055
You have a TV?

51:22.142 --> 51:23.103
Yeah.

51:35.807 --> 51:37.024
Stop.

51:50.911 --> 51:51.935
Oh, shit!

51:53.502 --> 51:55.516
Just when
it was getting good!

51:55.518 --> 51:56.603
I think,
I think...

51:56.605 --> 51:58.397
It's just the trip-switch.

51:58.399 --> 52:01.373
It goes from time to time.
But God what a time to go!

52:04.318 --> 52:06.044
You want a hand?

52:06.046 --> 52:07.581
I'd love it! Nah,
I'm only messing.

52:07.583 --> 52:09.052
I've got it.
I've got it.

52:09.054 --> 52:10.015
Okay.

52:12.734 --> 52:14.172
That was
the scariest part.

52:14.174 --> 52:17.536
They taking
proper jumpers.

52:33.471 --> 52:34.783
Jesus Christ!

52:35.775 --> 52:37.055
You scared
the shit out of me!

52:40.862 --> 52:41.951
Are you all right?

52:55.231 --> 52:56.540
Do we need more beers?

52:56.542 --> 52:57.565
I mean, we...

52:57.567 --> 52:59.836
Should we get more beers
before it's too late?

52:59.838 --> 53:01.150
No, we should have plenty.

53:02.655 --> 53:04.156
We can't do anything
about it now anyway,

53:04.158 --> 53:07.100
all the drivers
have been drinking.

53:07.102 --> 53:09.277
I could call Ray.

53:09.279 --> 53:10.527
Good luck with that.

53:11.711 --> 53:12.764
I'm sure the cops around here

53:12.766 --> 53:14.459
won't mind
a little drunk driving.

53:14.461 --> 53:15.678
Don't even say that.

53:17.342 --> 53:19.837
What are we gonna do?
We don't have any beer.

53:19.839 --> 53:21.760
I'm sure
you'll think of something.

53:29.759 --> 53:30.815
Oh, I see.

53:40.702 --> 53:42.301
I know you saw us last night.

53:42.303 --> 53:46.204
But really you didn't have to go all crazy
lady shit with the fucking lipstick.

53:46.206 --> 53:47.612
What are you talking about?

53:47.614 --> 53:50.590
I'm talking about the message you
decided to leave on the mirror.

53:51.070 --> 53:52.031
Very mature.

53:52.861 --> 53:54.109
Huh.

53:54.111 --> 53:55.486
Look who's talking.

53:57.886 --> 53:59.292
I don't know what happened
last night, right?

53:59.294 --> 54:03.004
Maybe it was the smokes, or whatever
is coming out of that sinkhole.

54:03.006 --> 54:04.509
I mean, even Ger is saying
that things are going...

54:04.511 --> 54:08.827
Jesus, will you take some
responsibility for yourself for once?

54:08.829 --> 54:11.804
For once? I always take
responsibility for myself!

54:11.806 --> 54:15.519
You're always out partying,
or drinking, with men.

54:17.439 --> 54:19.995
What? Oh, my God!

54:19.997 --> 54:21.949
It's not like
you never partied.

54:21.951 --> 54:23.388
What's that supposed to mean?

54:23.390 --> 54:24.671
You know exactly
what that means.

54:32.925 --> 54:34.399
You're gonna
have to tell Lucy.

54:36.925 --> 54:39.165
And what good
could that possibly do?

54:39.167 --> 54:40.829
It's the right thing to do.

54:40.831 --> 54:42.971
Really? Because I don't
remember you saying that

54:42.973 --> 54:44.575
the last time you saw him
with another woman.

54:45.279 --> 54:47.197
I didn't know her.

54:47.199 --> 54:48.443
And what difference
does that make?

54:48.445 --> 54:49.564
Lucy is our friend!

54:49.566 --> 54:52.348
She's your friend really!
I mean, I barely know her.

54:52.350 --> 54:53.628
Yeah, she's lovely
and everything

54:53.630 --> 54:56.509
but when was the last time we
ever met up for a cup of coffee?

54:56.511 --> 54:58.812
Look, this happened
in my house, okay?

54:58.814 --> 55:00.799
You're going to have
to tell her, or I will.

55:18.205 --> 55:22.331
That's weird. I didn't think
there was any reception in here.

55:22.333 --> 55:25.856
Anyway, it's Jason. He says
he's outside with a smoke.

55:26.686 --> 55:28.414
Anyone want to...

55:29.087 --> 55:30.396
I'll pass.

55:30.398 --> 55:31.359
I'm out.

55:31.966 --> 55:33.183
Well, suit yourselves.

55:36.766 --> 55:39.227
Is it just me or are things
getting a bit weird around here?

55:39.229 --> 55:40.415
Mmm-hmm.

55:43.902 --> 55:47.037
God, you don't do things
by halves, anyway.

55:47.039 --> 55:48.991
Well, everyone
keeps telling me that.

55:50.622 --> 55:52.894
Sometimes I wish
I was a bit more like you.

55:55.389 --> 55:57.340
You know, more spontaneous.

55:57.342 --> 55:59.422
Well, it's easy. Just do
something spontaneous.

56:16.191 --> 56:17.344
Jason.

56:44.990 --> 56:47.486
What the fuck are they doing out there?
Building a fort?

56:48.670 --> 56:50.142
I'll go out,
take a look.

57:00.829 --> 57:01.790
Shane.

57:06.078 --> 57:07.358
Shane!

57:26.941 --> 57:29.052
Well, I don't know
where they are.

57:29.054 --> 57:30.619
I don't know
what they're doing.

57:30.621 --> 57:32.926
I thought I heard them
outside earlier.

57:33.725 --> 57:34.782
Okay.

57:39.550 --> 57:40.543
Oh, my God!

57:41.982 --> 57:43.356
Oh, my God.

57:43.358 --> 57:46.300
Go away! Go away.

57:46.302 --> 57:48.764
Oh, my God, he gave me
a heart attack!

57:48.766 --> 57:50.590
I'm gonna kill him.
Oh, my God.

57:51.966 --> 57:53.087
Jesus.

57:53.822 --> 57:54.940
Will you join me now?

57:54.942 --> 57:57.307
Jesus! What was
the screaming about?

57:57.309 --> 57:58.780
Just Shane acting
the maggot again.

57:58.782 --> 58:00.507
Fuck sake.
Are those two still outside?

58:00.509 --> 58:01.595
Mmm-hmm.

58:01.597 --> 58:03.419
They must have
a lot to talk about.

58:12.702 --> 58:13.855
Need a beer.

58:21.438 --> 58:23.291
Lucy, I need
to tell you something.

58:23.293 --> 58:24.379
No. I'll tell her.

58:24.381 --> 58:25.659
No, you won't.

58:25.661 --> 58:30.302
We're planning a big night out
for your birthday next month.

58:31.134 --> 58:32.094
Really?

58:33.374 --> 58:34.971
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

58:34.973 --> 58:37.084
Well, look I wasn't going
to tell you,

58:37.086 --> 58:39.195
but Emma said that we should
just in case you had plans.

58:39.197 --> 58:41.757
That's so nice!

58:41.759 --> 58:43.870
I thought you were going
to tell me something serious.

58:45.469 --> 58:47.294
This isn't a weekend
for serious things.

58:49.693 --> 58:51.102
Excuse me a second.

58:53.150 --> 58:55.387
Oh, listen, will you call
the lads back in on your way?

58:55.389 --> 58:56.703
Yeah.

58:58.237 --> 58:59.196
It'll be a good night.

58:59.198 --> 59:01.055
Yeah, I really do hope
it will be.

59:51.902 --> 59:54.524
You are snappy.

59:55.806 --> 59:58.300
Emma's such
a drama queen.

59:58.302 --> 01:00:00.540
She is on her own
in the dark.

01:00:00.542 --> 01:00:03.419
That sound freaked me out,
and I was here with you guys.

01:00:03.421 --> 01:00:04.603
We should go
and get her.

01:00:04.605 --> 01:00:05.951
Come on.

01:00:11.999 --> 01:00:13.883
- Jesus!
- We have to get out of here!

01:00:13.885 --> 01:00:15.228
What is wrong?

01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:16.732
Everything's wrong! I can't stay...
I'm not staying here.

01:00:16.734 --> 01:00:17.727
What?

01:00:18.430 --> 01:00:19.391
Fuck.

01:00:20.446 --> 01:00:21.596
What's up with her?

01:00:21.598 --> 01:00:24.124
- It has to be the sinkhole. The fumes.
- But Pete said...

01:00:24.126 --> 01:00:25.021
I don't care what Pete said!

01:00:25.023 --> 01:00:26.684
I lost it out in the woods.
Now Emma...

01:00:26.686 --> 01:00:28.508
You think there's
something in the air?

01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:31.004
I know there is. This whole
weekend hasn't been right.

01:00:31.006 --> 01:00:32.156
Maybe we should leave.

01:00:32.158 --> 01:00:34.204
Don't be stupid!
We've all been drinking.

01:00:34.206 --> 01:00:35.838
Fuck!

01:00:39.486 --> 01:00:40.860
Emma! Wait!

01:00:40.862 --> 01:00:42.652
This is fucked up.

01:00:42.654 --> 01:00:43.964
Was there anyone
in the car with her?

01:00:43.966 --> 01:00:45.403
No, I didn't see anyone.

01:00:45.405 --> 01:00:46.719
So where the hell
are the other two?

01:00:49.373 --> 01:00:50.334
The fuse box.

01:01:05.949 --> 01:01:07.228
I need to find Jason.

01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:09.499
We should call the police. Emma
was drinking vodka straight...

01:01:09.501 --> 01:01:12.348
No, no, no, no, no, no.
We're not calling the police.

01:01:12.350 --> 01:01:14.139
She could lose her license!
She could go to prison...

01:01:14.141 --> 01:01:14.973
And she might kill someone!

01:01:14.975 --> 01:01:16.383
No. We're not
calling the police.

01:01:17.374 --> 01:01:18.527
I'm calling the police.

01:01:25.693 --> 01:01:26.814
Jason!

01:01:30.494 --> 01:01:31.614
Jason!

01:01:36.317 --> 01:01:37.820
They must be
down by the well.

01:01:37.822 --> 01:01:40.124
I'm gonna get Jason then
we'll go after her.

01:01:40.126 --> 01:01:41.470
But we've been drinking.

01:01:50.013 --> 01:01:51.260
Jason!

01:02:12.029 --> 01:02:13.020
Where the hell are you?

01:02:13.022 --> 01:02:14.268
<i>...coming to the house...</i>

01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:16.475
- Ray...
- <i>Shane and Jason are with me...</i>

01:02:16.477 --> 01:02:17.563
Wait. I can't hear you.

01:02:17.565 --> 01:02:18.782
- <i>Be long...</i>
- What?

01:02:19.677 --> 01:02:21.275
Wait.

01:02:21.277 --> 01:02:22.523
- What?
- <i>Coming to get you...</i>

01:02:22.525 --> 01:02:23.806
What? Are Shane
and Jason with you?

01:02:24.830 --> 01:02:26.395
Ray?

01:02:26.397 --> 01:02:28.094
Ray, can you hear me?

01:02:28.349 --> 01:02:29.373
Ray!

01:02:29.598 --> 01:02:30.783
Shit.

01:02:31.358 --> 01:02:32.828
What was that about?

01:02:32.830 --> 01:02:35.131
I don't know.
Reception was awful.

01:02:35.133 --> 01:02:38.203
I think Ray's on his way and that
Shane and Jason are with him.

01:02:38.205 --> 01:02:39.580
How could Shane and Jason
be with him?

01:02:39.582 --> 01:02:42.427
I don't know.
We need to find Marissa.

01:02:42.429 --> 01:02:44.315
But she's down
by the well.

01:02:44.317 --> 01:02:45.948
Do you know where it is?

01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:47.100
I don't want
to go down there.

01:02:47.102 --> 01:02:49.084
She'll be back in a minute.
We should just wait here.

01:02:49.086 --> 01:02:50.238
Just show me where it is.

01:03:04.958 --> 01:03:06.013
Jason.

01:03:10.622 --> 01:03:11.774
Jason!

01:03:16.381 --> 01:03:17.883
Jason!

01:03:17.885 --> 01:03:19.037
Marissa!

01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:22.174
Marissa!

01:03:24.317 --> 01:03:25.467
I don't want
to go to the well.

01:03:25.469 --> 01:03:27.995
There are signs everywhere,
pointing all over the place.

01:03:27.997 --> 01:03:30.751
None of them lead anywhere but
round and round in circles.

01:03:31.869 --> 01:03:32.924
We shouldn't go there.

01:03:35.230 --> 01:03:36.191
What's that?

01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:40.030
That's Jason's ringtone.

01:03:40.605 --> 01:03:41.855
Come on!

01:04:21.437 --> 01:04:22.527
Jason!

01:04:26.078 --> 01:04:27.166
Jason!

01:04:30.302 --> 01:04:31.390
Jason!

01:04:33.117 --> 01:04:34.174
Jason!

01:05:19.166 --> 01:05:20.444
Oh, fuck.

01:05:20.446 --> 01:05:22.364
You fucking stabbed me.

01:05:22.366 --> 01:05:24.831
Oh, fuck! I'm so sorry!

01:05:25.278 --> 01:05:26.655
It hurts.

01:05:27.549 --> 01:05:28.698
I'll get help!

01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:30.398
Where the fuck
are you going to get help?

01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:38.175
Oh, God.

01:05:38.685 --> 01:05:40.123
Help me.

01:05:40.125 --> 01:05:41.919
I'm so sorry. I can't.

01:05:57.021 --> 01:06:01.275
Jason! Shane!

01:06:01.277 --> 01:06:03.355
Are you sure this is a good idea?
I mean, these woods...

01:06:03.357 --> 01:06:05.244
Something might have
happened to them.

01:06:05.246 --> 01:06:07.003
But didn't you say
they were with Ray?

01:06:07.005 --> 01:06:09.151
I don't know.
I couldn't hear him properly.

01:06:16.189 --> 01:06:17.917
I think it's coming
from over there.

01:06:30.942 --> 01:06:32.031
Jason.

01:06:32.797 --> 01:06:33.883
Jason!

01:06:33.885 --> 01:06:37.566
Pete? No, this is Lucy.
I'm a friend of Jason's.

01:06:40.542 --> 01:06:41.695
What? Why?

01:06:45.982 --> 01:06:48.251
He said we've gotta
get out of here right now.

01:06:48.253 --> 01:06:49.499
- Why?
- I don't know.

01:06:49.501 --> 01:06:50.686
He sounded scared.

01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:53.628
Let's go.

01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:54.907
We can't!
What about Jason?

01:06:54.909 --> 01:06:55.900
He's not here!

01:06:55.902 --> 01:06:57.663
I'm not getting lost out
in the woods again.

01:07:03.165 --> 01:07:04.127
Come on, Lucy!

01:07:16.124 --> 01:07:17.151
No no no...

01:07:19.229 --> 01:07:21.917
No. Please, no.

01:07:25.917 --> 01:07:27.164
Emma!

01:07:27.166 --> 01:07:28.542
Emma! Wait!

01:07:29.564 --> 01:07:30.750
Emma!

01:07:31.932 --> 01:07:33.341
Emma!

01:08:38.076 --> 01:08:39.898
We were never
this far from the house.

01:08:39.899 --> 01:08:41.913
I told you. There's
something in the air.

01:08:41.916 --> 01:08:43.035
Do you drive?

01:08:43.037 --> 01:08:44.059
No. You?

01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:45.631
No. But Marissa does.

01:09:48.667 --> 01:09:49.886
Ray! He's back!

01:10:41.501 --> 01:10:42.525
Ray!

01:10:42.876 --> 01:10:43.869
Ray!

01:10:48.414 --> 01:10:49.405
Ray?

01:10:51.133 --> 01:10:52.186
Ray?

01:10:55.998 --> 01:10:57.883
Ray? Are you okay?

01:10:57.885 --> 01:11:00.574
Ray? Ray's more than okay.

01:11:03.005 --> 01:11:04.510
He's fucking great!

01:11:18.429 --> 01:11:20.157
It's me! It's me!

01:11:24.798 --> 01:11:26.972
It's me. It's me.
Be cool.

01:11:26.974 --> 01:11:28.188
I saw something.

01:11:28.190 --> 01:11:29.499
I did too.

01:11:29.501 --> 01:11:30.812
We have to
get out of here.

01:11:30.814 --> 01:11:32.477
That's what I've been
saying all along.

01:11:34.684 --> 01:11:36.603
It's Ray. It's Ray.

01:11:36.605 --> 01:11:38.269
Ray! Ray!

01:11:38.589 --> 01:11:40.475
Ray! Ray!

01:11:40.477 --> 01:11:41.823
That's not Ray!

01:11:43.453 --> 01:11:46.046
Ray! Ray!

01:11:46.908 --> 01:11:47.995
I saw him!

01:11:47.997 --> 01:11:49.115
It's a fucking creature!

01:11:49.117 --> 01:11:50.463
Ray!

01:11:52.924 --> 01:11:54.014
Ray!

01:11:57.693 --> 01:12:01.659
Ray! Wait for me!
We have to get out of here!

01:12:01.661 --> 01:12:03.198
No one
is getting out of here.

01:12:18.844 --> 01:12:20.542
Ray! Where are you?

01:12:22.589 --> 01:12:23.774
I'm not here.

01:12:27.676 --> 01:12:29.563
You're scaring me!

01:12:29.565 --> 01:12:32.478
It's not a sinkhole.
It's just fun for them.

01:12:38.684 --> 01:12:39.774
- Ray!
- Stay where you are!

01:12:40.861 --> 01:12:42.522
We're all gone.

01:12:42.524 --> 01:12:43.933
All except you and Ger.

01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:50.298
If you want to live tonight, you'll
have to sacrifice your soul.

01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:52.509
It needs seven souls,
it can't go back with less.

01:12:53.469 --> 01:12:54.428
What?

01:12:54.430 --> 01:12:57.981
I can't save anyone else.
Neither can you.

01:12:59.230 --> 01:13:02.268
This is the only way.

01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:06.108
Sacrifice your soul tonight, and you'll
have the rest of your life to earn it back.

01:13:06.110 --> 01:13:08.411
But we can leave now.

01:13:08.413 --> 01:13:10.270
It's too late for me.

01:13:12.861 --> 01:13:14.238
Let me save you.

01:13:45.181 --> 01:13:47.037
Lucy. Thank God.

01:13:47.965 --> 01:13:49.182
I thought you were gone.

01:13:51.485 --> 01:13:54.364
We have to get out of here.
Come on.

01:13:54.366 --> 01:13:55.870
We have to
get out of here.

01:13:57.405 --> 01:13:58.683
We have to
go back to the house.

01:13:58.685 --> 01:14:00.254
We can't go back there.

01:14:01.182 --> 01:14:02.426
Why?

01:14:02.428 --> 01:14:03.677
Because Ray is there.

01:14:04.957 --> 01:14:07.070
Even though
he's not Ray anymore.

01:14:08.028 --> 01:14:09.373
What do you mean?

01:14:10.716 --> 01:14:11.965
He's dead.

01:14:12.892 --> 01:14:14.590
Everyone is dead.

01:14:17.117 --> 01:14:18.462
Oh. Jesus Christ.

01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:34.686
Ray said that
he's going to help us.

01:14:36.060 --> 01:14:37.979
But I thought you just said
that he was dead?

01:14:37.981 --> 01:14:40.570
No, I spoke to him.

01:14:40.572 --> 01:14:42.522
He said he's
going to buy us time.

01:14:42.524 --> 01:14:44.893
But we have
to leave now, okay?

01:15:26.173 --> 01:15:27.707
Wait a minute!

01:15:27.709 --> 01:15:29.434
Aren't we running
towards the sinkhole?

01:15:29.436 --> 01:15:30.747
We have to go this way!

01:15:30.749 --> 01:15:33.498
The sinkhole is where all these
fucking things are coming from!

01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:34.395
We have to turn back.

01:15:34.397 --> 01:15:36.414
We can't turn back.
You have to trust me.

01:15:43.485 --> 01:15:44.860
I want to go back.

01:15:44.862 --> 01:15:46.269
I want to go back.

01:16:01.245 --> 01:16:02.301
I'm sorry!

01:16:04.637 --> 01:16:06.299
What have you done?

01:16:06.301 --> 01:16:07.485
What have you done!

01:16:08.957 --> 01:16:09.979
Help!

01:16:09.981 --> 01:16:11.002
Help me!

01:17:20.064 --> 01:17:25.064
