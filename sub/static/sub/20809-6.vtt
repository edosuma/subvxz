was strong,

00:38.238 --> 00:38.970
- Previously on
"AllStars... "

00:38.973 --> 00:40.072
and then it was like someone
took the needle off the record.

00:40.073 --> 00:41.172
- Previously on
"AllStars... "

00:41.175 --> 00:42.775

we made it out!

01:46.807 --> 01:47.372
- Huh.

01:47.374 --> 01:49.091
I was taken back
a little bit.

01:49.092 --> 01:50.809
- Huh.

01:50.811 --> 01:52.378
- That's okay. Bye.

01:52.379 --> 01:53.946

01:55.049 --> 01:58.150
- Do I believe Phi Phi's
explanation

01:58.152 --> 01:59.285
for not hugging Alyssa?

01:59.286 --> 02:00.419
- Do I believe Phi Phi's
explanation

02:00.421 --> 02:01.053
No.

explanation

02:01.689 --> 02:02.138

02:02.139 --> 02:02.588
- Do I believe Phi Phi's
explanation

02:03.974 --> 02:05.357
- Do I believe Phi Phi's
explanation

02:05.359 --> 02:06.558
Obviously, I'm very excited

02:06.559 --> 02:07.758
- Do I believe Phi Phi's
explanation

02:07.761 --> 02:08.343
but it sucks
to see Phi Phi leave.

02:08.344 --> 02:08.926
- Do I believe Phi Phi's
explanation

02:08.929 --> 02:10.496
But if she had to go
in order for my girl to stay,

02:10.497 --> 02:12.064
- Do I believe Phi Phi's
explanation

02:12.066 --> 02:12.998
I'm happy with that.

- Do I believe Phi Phi's
explanation

02:13.934 --> 02:14.450

What the fuck?

02:16.186 --> 02:17.402
- Do I believe Phi Phi's
explanation

02:17.404 --> 02:19.104
We go from a top five
to a top six.

02:19.105 --> 02:20.805
- Do I believe Phi Phi's
explanation

02:20.808 --> 02:21.524
That kind of sucks.

02:21.525 --> 02:22.241
- Do I believe Phi Phi's
explanation

02:22.243 --> 02:22.892
- At this point
in the competition,

02:22.893 --> 02:23.542
- Do I believe Phi Phi's
explanation

02:23.544 --> 02:25.144
stakes are so high and
everybody's on their A game.

02:25.145 --> 02:26.745
- Do I believe Phi Phi's
explanation

02:26.747 --> 02:27.713
We all want to win.

02:27.714 --> 02:28.680

Hey, Katya.

09:54.277 --> 09:55.527
My name is Alyssa Edwards,
and this is the true secret!

09:55.529 --> 09:55.861
- Hello, mother.

09:55.862 --> 09:56.194
My name is Alyssa Edwards,
and this is the true secret!

09:56.196 --> 09:57.479
- We are excited to hear
what your product is.

09:57.480 --> 09:58.763
My name is Alyssa Edwards,
and this is the true secret!

09:58.765 --> 10:00.015
- So it's called
Katya's Crisis Control,

10:00.016 --> 10:01.266
My name is Alyssa Edwards,
and this is the true secret!

10:01.268 --> 10:02.351
and it's a refreshing
body mist,

10:02.352 --> 10:03.435
My name is Alyssa Edwards,
and this is the true secret!

10:03.437 --> 10:04.503
and it also packs
the right amount of thorazine

10:04.504 --> 10:05.570
My name is Alyssa Edwards,
and this is the true secret!

10:05.572 --> 10:08.206
to protect from anxiety,
fear, hallucinations or ghosts.

10:08.207 --> 10:10.841
My name is Alyssa Edwards,
and this is the true secret!

10:10.844 --> 10:11.359
- So you're selling...

10:11.360 --> 10:11.875
My name is Alyssa Edwards,
and this is the true secret!

10:11.878 --> 10:12.711
- I'm selling a feeling,

10:12.712 --> 10:13.545
My name is Alyssa Edwards,
and this is the true secret!

10:13.547 --> 10:14.413
a sensation of, like, um...

10:14.414 --> 10:15.280
My name is Alyssa Edwards,
and this is the true secret!

10:15.282 --> 10:16.348
- You know that's the first way
to kill a brand

10:16.349 --> 10:17.415
My name is Alyssa Edwards,
and this is the true secret!

10:17.417 --> 10:18.466
is to sell something
that doesn't have value.

10:18.467 --> 10:19.516
My name is Alyssa Edwards,
and this is the true secret!

10:19.519 --> 10:21.336
So I think you have a little bit
of branding identity crisis.

10:21.337 --> 10:23.154
My name is Alyssa Edwards,
and this is the true secret!

10:23.156 --> 10:24.222
- Okay. Well, that's
very on-brand for me.

10:24.223 --> 10:25.289
My name is Alyssa Edwards,
and this is the true secret!

10:25.292 --> 10:26.975
- I think, right now, the only
crisis here is the product.

10:26.976 --> 10:28.659
My name is Alyssa Edwards,
and this is the true secret!

10:28.662 --> 10:29.845
I want to have something that
somebody actually wants to buy.

10:29.846 --> 10:31.029
My name is Alyssa Edwards,
and this is the true secret!

10:31.031 --> 10:32.931
Just lose the bottle
and the whole idea.

10:32.932 --> 10:34.832
My name is Alyssa Edwards,
and this is the true secret!

10:34.835 --> 10:35.384
Start over.

10:35.385 --> 10:35.934
My name is Alyssa Edwards,
and this is the true secret!

10:35.936 --> 10:36.451
- Okay.
- I'm sorry.

10:36.452 --> 10:36.967
My name is Alyssa Edwards,
and this is the true secret!

10:36.970 --> 10:38.186
- Thanks, Katya.
- Thank you.

10:38.187 --> 10:39.403
My name is Alyssa Edwards,
and this is the true secret!

10:41.508 --> 10:43.375
Whoo!

10:43.377 --> 10:44.693
(all laugh)

10:44.694 --> 10:46.010
Whoo!

10:46.613 --> 10:48.046
- Hey, Tatianna.
- Hey.

10:48.048 --> 10:48.680
- What's the product?

10:48.681 --> 10:49.313
- Hey, Tatianna.
- Hey.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.716
- It's a tea set,
perfect for talking shit

10:50.717 --> 10:52.117
- Hey, Tatianna.
- Hey.

10:52.119 --> 10:54.002
or "spill tea," as we like
to say it in the biz.

10:54.003 --> 10:55.886
- Hey, Tatianna.
- Hey.

10:55.889 --> 10:56.688
- So you've got
this tea set.

10:56.689 --> 10:57.488
- Hey, Tatianna.
- Hey.

10:57.491 --> 10:58.323
How's the commercial
going to unfold?

10:58.324 --> 10:59.156
- Hey, Tatianna.
- Hey.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.125
- It's going to be
very much just me walking,

11:00.126 --> 11:01.092
- Hey, Tatianna.
- Hey.

11:01.094 --> 11:01.893
saying, hey, you like
talking shit?

11:01.894 --> 11:02.693
- Hey, Tatianna.
- Hey.

11:02.696 --> 11:04.463
You can now spill the tea
with me, Tati.

11:04.464 --> 11:06.231
- Hey, Tatianna.
- Hey.

11:06.233 --> 11:07.265
And then they'll be
cutaways of me,

11:07.266 --> 11:08.298
- Hey, Tatianna.
- Hey.

11:08.301 --> 11:09.234
like did you hear
what she did?

11:09.235 --> 11:10.168
- Hey, Tatianna.
- Hey.

11:10.170 --> 11:10.752
- I see.
- Girl.

11:10.753 --> 11:11.335
- Hey, Tatianna.
- Hey.

11:11.338 --> 11:12.120
- You basically hooked me in

11:12.121 --> 11:12.903
- Hey, Tatianna.
- Hey.

11:12.906 --> 11:14.389
by asking me if I wanted
to talk crap about somebody.

11:14.390 --> 11:15.873
- Hey, Tatianna.
- Hey.

11:15.876 --> 11:16.758
If anybody says they don't,
they're lying.

11:16.759 --> 11:17.641
- Hey, Tatianna.
- Hey.

11:17.644 --> 11:19.794
The commercial was maybe the
best presentation I've heard.

11:19.795 --> 11:21.945
- Hey, Tatianna.
- Hey.

11:21.948 --> 11:22.414
- Wow.
- Well, blam.

11:22.415 --> 11:22.881
- Hey, Tatianna.
- Hey.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.082
- Well, get back to work.
Can't wait to see it.

11:24.083 --> 11:25.282
- Hey, Tatianna.
- Hey.

11:25.285 --> 11:25.951
- Will do.
- Thank you.

11:25.952 --> 11:26.618
- Hey, Tatianna.
- Hey.

11:26.620 --> 11:27.285
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

11:27.286 --> 11:27.951
- Hey, Tatianna.
- Hey.

11:27.954 --> 11:29.104
- See you. Okay.

11:29.105 --> 11:30.255
- Hey, Tatianna.
- Hey.

11:30.257 --> 11:30.889
- All right, ladies,
gather round.

11:30.890 --> 11:31.522
- Hey, Tatianna.
- Hey.

11:31.525 --> 11:33.342
Now, in a few moments,
you'll shoot your commercials

11:33.343 --> 11:35.160
- Hey, Tatianna.
- Hey.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.962
with Michelle Visage
and Carson Kressley.

11:36.963 --> 11:38.763
- Hey, Tatianna.

11:38.765 --> 11:40.649
So good luck
and don't fuck it up.

11:40.650 --> 11:42.534
- Hey, Tatianna.
- Hey.

11:42.536 --> 11:43.568
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

11:43.569 --> 11:44.601
- Hey, Tatianna.
- Hey.

11:46.440 --> 11:47.939
- Oh, my God,
what are you gonna do?

11:47.941 --> 11:49.157
'Cause I just--I heard
that they were saying,

11:49.158 --> 11:50.374
- Oh, my God,
what are you gonna do?

11:50.377 --> 11:51.076
like, nope, start over.

11:51.077 --> 11:51.776
- Oh, my God,
what are you gonna do?

11:51.778 --> 11:52.410
- Yeah, I don't have time
to start over

11:52.411 --> 11:53.043
- Oh, my God,
what are you gonna do?

11:53.046 --> 11:53.879
and I like my idea,
so I'm just gonna do it.

11:53.880 --> 11:54.713
- Oh, my God,
what are you gonna do?

11:54.715 --> 11:56.148
- Katya's walkthrough
didn't really go that well,

11:56.149 --> 11:57.582
- Oh, my God,
what are you gonna do?

11:57.584 --> 12:00.051
and when somebody kind of shoots
the shit your entire idea,

12:00.052 --> 12:02.519
- Oh, my God,
what are you gonna do?

12:02.522 --> 12:03.088
that's a little
nerve-wracking.

12:03.089 --> 12:03.655
- Oh, my God,
what are you gonna do?

12:03.657 --> 12:05.957
- I'm not gonna panic
because I don't do that anymore.

12:05.958 --> 12:08.258
- Oh, my God,
what are you gonna do?

12:08.261 --> 12:09.544
It's gonna be okay.

12:09.545 --> 12:10.828
- Oh, my God,
what are you gonna do?

12:11.732 --> 12:12.397
- Coming up...

12:12.399 --> 12:13.398
- Want to wake up
and just be cute?

12:13.399 --> 12:14.398
- Coming up...

12:14.401 --> 12:16.184
- If you're selling an energy
drink, you gotta be energetic.

12:16.185 --> 12:17.968
- Coming up...

12:17.971 --> 12:18.420
- Okay.

12:18.421 --> 12:18.870
- Coming up...

12:18.872 --> 12:21.673
- And I might even show you some
of the best wig reveal secrets.

12:21.674 --> 12:24.475

(RuPaul laughs)

12:34.588 --> 12:35.954

12:35.956 --> 12:36.471
- So for today's
maxi challenge,

12:36.472 --> 12:36.987
- Hi, Katya.

12:36.990 --> 12:39.074
we have to pitch a product
that reflects our brand.

12:39.075 --> 12:41.159
- Hi, Katya.

12:41.161 --> 12:42.794
- You've got props,
you've got pit crew,

12:42.795 --> 12:44.428
- Hi, Katya.

12:44.431 --> 12:44.830
and you've got furniture

12:44.831 --> 12:45.230
- Hi, Katya.

12:45.232 --> 12:46.448
courtesy of our friends
at Riverworks.

12:46.449 --> 12:47.665
- Hi, Katya.

12:47.667 --> 12:48.133
- Is there a pig?

12:48.134 --> 12:48.600
- Hi, Katya.

12:48.602 --> 12:49.885
Oh, there's a turkey.
That's even better.

12:49.886 --> 12:51.169
- Hi, Katya.

12:51.171 --> 12:51.470
- (laughs)

12:51.471 --> 12:51.770
- Hi, Katya.

12:51.772 --> 12:53.005
- I'm gonna hold the turkey.
I'm in a kitchen.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.239
- Hi, Katya.

12:54.241 --> 12:55.340
- You look confused.

12:55.341 --> 12:56.440
- Hi, Katya.

12:56.443 --> 12:57.008
So you're in the kitchen.

12:57.009 --> 12:57.574
- Hi, Katya.

12:57.577 --> 12:58.326
- I'm in the kitchen.
- Okay.

12:58.327 --> 12:59.076
- Hi, Katya.

12:59.079 --> 12:59.644
And you're gonna be
standing there.

12:59.645 --> 13:00.210
- Hi, Katya.

13:00.213 --> 13:01.229
- Standing here
in the kitchen.

13:01.230 --> 13:02.246
- Hi, Katya.

13:02.249 --> 13:03.031
- What's your lines?

13:03.032 --> 13:03.814
- Hi, Katya.

13:03.817 --> 13:06.651
- Um, these days, being
a woman is really hard.

13:06.652 --> 13:09.486
- Hi, Katya.

13:09.489 --> 13:09.888
Keep going?

13:09.889 --> 13:10.288
- Hi, Katya.

13:10.290 --> 13:10.939
- Is there more?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

13:10.940 --> 13:11.589
- Hi, Katya.

13:11.591 --> 13:12.524
That's the whole commercial.

13:12.525 --> 13:13.458
- Hi, Katya.

13:13.460 --> 13:14.626
- So Detox,

13:14.627 --> 13:15.793
- Hi, Katya.

13:15.796 --> 13:16.111
- Mm-hmm.

13:16.112 --> 13:16.427
- Hi, Katya.

13:16.429 --> 13:17.412
I'm nervous going into
shooting my commercial

13:17.413 --> 13:18.396
- Hi, Katya.

13:18.398 --> 13:19.080
because I focused
a lot of my attention

13:19.081 --> 13:19.763
- Hi, Katya.

13:19.766 --> 13:21.232
on making my little
trash can come to life,

13:21.233 --> 13:22.699
- Hi, Katya.

13:22.702 --> 13:24.068
so I'm kind of winging
everything as I go.

13:24.069 --> 13:25.435
- Hi, Katya.

13:25.438 --> 13:26.488
- And action.

13:26.489 --> 13:27.539
- Hi, Katya.

13:29.009 --> 13:30.542
- (laughs) Sorry.

13:30.544 --> 13:31.927
Detox's trash-talking
trash receptacle

13:31.928 --> 13:33.311
- (laughs) Sorry.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.129
has many catch phrases.

13:34.130 --> 13:34.946
- (laughs) Sorry.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.364
I've had it.
Officially.

13:36.365 --> 13:37.781
- (laughs) Sorry.

13:37.784 --> 13:38.450
This tastes like shit.

13:38.451 --> 13:39.117
- (laughs) Sorry.

13:39.119 --> 13:40.302
- This tastes like shit
is a catch phrase?

13:40.303 --> 13:41.486
- (laughs) Sorry.

13:41.488 --> 13:42.154
- It's gonna be new ones.

13:42.155 --> 13:42.821

14:14.254 --> 14:15.554
- Why wake up

14:16.857 --> 14:19.508
when you can spring up

14:19.509 --> 14:22.160
- Alaska
Thunderfun Fashion Tape.

14:22.863 --> 14:25.396
- What you just did wasn't
really full of energy.

14:25.398 --> 14:25.780
- No.
- Okay.

14:25.781 --> 14:26.163
- What you just did wasn't
really full of energy.

14:26.166 --> 14:27.532
- If you're selling an energy
drink, you got to be energetic.

14:27.533 --> 14:28.899
- What you just did wasn't
really full of energy.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.118
- Okay.
- Oh, yes. Ooh, ooh.

14:30.119 --> 14:31.335
- What you just did wasn't
really full of energy.

14:31.338 --> 14:32.587
Oh, the phone's ringing,
the phone's ringing.

14:32.588 --> 14:33.837

19:27.800 --> 19:28.833
This week,
we challenged our queens

19:28.834 --> 19:29.867
¶ Cover girl,
put the bass in your walk ¶

19:29.869 --> 19:32.020
to create and pitch
their own AllStar merch.

19:32.021 --> 19:34.172
¶ Cover girl,
put the bass in your walk ¶

19:34.174 --> 19:37.175
And tonight on the runway,
the category is pants.

19:37.176 --> 19:40.177
¶ Cover girl,
put the bass in your walk ¶

19:40.180 --> 19:40.879
Pants, I said.

19:40.880 --> 19:41.579
¶ Cover girl,
put the bass in your walk ¶

19:41.581 --> 19:42.063
(all laugh)

19:42.064 --> 19:42.546
¶ Cover girl,
put the bass in your walk ¶

19:42.549 --> 19:43.932
Gentlemen,
start your engines,

19:43.933 --> 19:45.316
¶ Cover girl,
put the bass in your walk ¶

19:45.318 --> 19:46.935
and may the best woman win.

19:46.936 --> 19:48.553
¶ Cover girl,
put the bass in your walk ¶

19:52.058 --> 19:54.892
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

19:54.894 --> 19:55.326
- That is Wigstock.

19:55.327 --> 19:55.759
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

19:55.762 --> 19:56.778
- Oh, she's putting the ho
back in Navaho.

19:56.779 --> 19:57.795
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

19:57.797 --> 19:58.629
- This outfit represents me
and my brand

19:58.630 --> 19:59.462
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

19:59.465 --> 20:00.164
because it's always
going to be glamorous

20:00.165 --> 20:00.864
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.534
and you can see every piece
of my bootylicious self.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.202
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.204
- Now, that's what I call
a power bell-bottom.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.205
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

20:08.208 --> 20:09.090
(all laugh)

20:09.091 --> 20:09.973
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

20:09.976 --> 20:10.275
Katya.

20:10.276 --> 20:10.575
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

20:10.577 --> 20:11.643
The Russians are
taking over the runway.

20:11.644 --> 20:12.710
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.429
- I'm giving you 1980s
lesbian literary agent,

20:14.430 --> 20:16.147
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

20:16.149 --> 20:18.316
disinterested, pissed-off
Ellen Barkin fantasy.

20:18.317 --> 20:20.484
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

20:20.486 --> 20:21.152
Comrade Katya.

20:21.153 --> 20:21.819
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

20:21.821 --> 20:22.970
- To androgyny and beyond.

20:22.971 --> 20:24.120
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

20:24.123 --> 20:24.739
- Alyssa Edwards.

20:24.740 --> 20:25.356
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

20:25.358 --> 20:26.824
- She's showing
a lot of beaver.

20:26.825 --> 20:28.291
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

20:28.294 --> 20:29.060
- I'm giving you all
a rich white woman.

20:29.061 --> 20:29.827
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

20:29.829 --> 20:32.296
"Dynasty," "Dallas,"
Joan Collins, rich.

20:32.297 --> 20:34.764
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

20:34.767 --> 20:37.335
My hair is so coiffed,
I don't care if my fur's fake.

20:37.336 --> 20:39.904
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

20:39.906 --> 20:40.955
- All that tail.

20:40.956 --> 20:42.005
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

20:42.008 --> 20:42.290
Detox.

20:42.291 --> 20:42.573
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

20:42.575 --> 20:43.674
- I always wanted to know
what happened to Raggedy Ann.

20:43.675 --> 20:44.774
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

20:44.777 --> 20:45.459
- My runway look
is inspired

20:45.460 --> 20:46.142
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

20:46.145 --> 20:47.328
by a vintage
Terry Leclair look.

20:47.329 --> 20:48.512
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

20:48.514 --> 20:50.114
But it's very, like,
futuristic cruise-wear.

20:50.115 --> 20:51.715
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

20:51.718 --> 20:53.067
- Now, this is how
they wear capris in Capri.

20:53.068 --> 20:54.417
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.336
- I think
it's a clam digger.

20:55.337 --> 20:56.253
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

20:56.256 --> 20:57.939
- What the fuck
did you call me?

20:57.940 --> 20:59.623
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

20:59.626 --> 20:59.958
Alaska.

20:59.959 --> 21:00.291
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

21:00.293 --> 21:01.843
The other Miss Ross, Betsy.

21:01.844 --> 21:03.394
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

21:03.396 --> 21:03.895
- Yeah.
(all laugh)

21:03.896 --> 21:04.395
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

21:04.397 --> 21:06.097
- I feel like
a real American she-ro.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.798
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

21:07.800 --> 21:08.466
These pants are very bizarre

21:08.467 --> 21:09.133
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

21:09.135 --> 21:10.618
and I guess
that's very much my brand.

21:10.619 --> 21:12.102
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

21:12.105 --> 21:13.454
- You know, I love the fringe
benefits of a government job.

21:13.455 --> 21:14.804
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.607
- That's her lunatic fringe.
- (laughs)

21:16.608 --> 21:18.408
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

21:18.411 --> 21:19.010
Tatianna.

21:19.011 --> 21:19.610
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

21:19.612 --> 21:22.046
- Ooh, all T-Boz, all shade.

21:22.047 --> 21:24.481
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

21:24.484 --> 21:24.849
(laughs)

21:24.850 --> 21:25.215
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

21:25.218 --> 21:27.602
- I'm choosing to work it out
to my T-Boz impersonation.

21:27.603 --> 21:29.987
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

21:29.989 --> 21:32.173
So I break out the slide and
the "Waterfalls" choreography.

21:32.174 --> 21:34.358
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

21:34.360 --> 21:35.426
You know, I'm always known
as, like, the pretty,

21:35.427 --> 21:36.493
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

21:36.496 --> 21:37.612
but I can do
other things, too.

21:37.613 --> 21:38.729
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

21:38.731 --> 21:39.914
- She ain't too proud
to drag.

21:39.915 --> 21:41.098
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

21:41.100 --> 21:41.365
- Uh-uh.

21:41.366 --> 21:41.631
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.151
- Now, don't go chasing
waterfalls.

21:43.152 --> 21:44.669
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

21:44.671 --> 21:45.036
Coming up...

21:45.037 --> 21:45.402
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

21:45.405 --> 21:46.054
- You never want
to be forgetful.

21:46.055 --> 21:46.704
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

21:46.706 --> 21:47.538
- It's just so ugly.

21:47.539 --> 21:48.371
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

21:48.374 --> 21:49.557
It's a really piss-poor
prototype.

21:49.558 --> 21:50.741
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

21:50.743 --> 21:52.310
(RuPaul laughs)

21:52.311 --> 21:53.878
Up first, Roxxxy Andrews.

21:54.681 --> 21:57.048
(RuPaul laughs)

21:57.050 --> 21:57.982
- Welcome, ladies.

21:57.983 --> 21:58.915
(RuPaul laughs)

21:58.918 --> 21:59.934
Let's take a look
at your commercials.

21:59.935 --> 22:00.951
(RuPaul laughs)

22:00.953 --> 22:02.603
First up,
Foxy Roxxxy Andrews.

22:02.604 --> 22:04.254
(RuPaul laughs)

22:04.257 --> 22:04.889
- Oh.

22:04.890 --> 22:05.522
(RuPaul laughs)

22:05.525 --> 22:06.391
I'm Roxxxy Andrews,
and I'm here

22:06.392 --> 22:07.258
(RuPaul laughs)

22:07.260 --> 22:08.343
to give you what
you've all been waiting for.

22:08.344 --> 22:09.427
(RuPaul laughs)

22:09.429 --> 22:11.663
The Roxxxy Andrews Wig Tricks
Instructional DVD.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.898
(RuPaul laughs)

22:13.900 --> 22:14.849
You ever
been making whoopie

22:14.850 --> 22:15.799
(RuPaul laughs)

22:15.802 --> 22:17.335
and all of a sudden
you lose your wig?

22:17.336 --> 22:18.869
(RuPaul laughs)

22:18.871 --> 22:19.320
Or performing at the club

22:19.321 --> 22:19.770
(RuPaul laughs)

22:19.772 --> 22:21.639
and you show the audience
how much hair you really have?

22:21.640 --> 22:23.507
(RuPaul laughs)

22:23.509 --> 22:25.159
Baby, this wig
ain't going nowhere.

22:25.160 --> 22:26.810
(RuPaul laughs)

22:26.813 --> 22:29.631
I'll even show you some of
my best wig reveal secrets.

22:29.632 --> 22:32.450
(RuPaul laughs)

22:34.087 --> 22:34.819
- Yes.

22:34.821 --> 22:36.054
- If you order now,
I'm going to throw in

22:36.055 --> 22:37.288
- Yes.

22:37.290 --> 22:38.623
Roxxxy Andrews'
super tacky Wig Glue.

22:38.624 --> 22:39.957
- Yes.

22:39.959 --> 22:41.776
Now, go out there
and get your life, honey.

22:41.777 --> 22:43.594
- Yes.

22:43.596 --> 22:44.512
(applause)

22:44.513 --> 22:45.429
- Yes.

22:45.431 --> 22:45.980
- Here's the thing
with the video.

22:45.981 --> 22:46.530
- Yes.

22:46.532 --> 22:48.633
Even though the sight gag was
there with losing the hair,

22:48.634 --> 22:50.735
- Yes.

22:50.737 --> 22:51.369
it's almost like
when you see it once

22:51.370 --> 22:52.002
- Yes.

22:52.004 --> 22:52.420
and it's really funny,

22:52.421 --> 22:52.837
- Yes.

22:52.839 --> 22:53.404
then next time,
it's like, oh, okay.

22:53.405 --> 22:53.970
- Yes.

22:53.973 --> 22:55.156
That made it
a little bit forgetful,

22:55.157 --> 22:56.340
- Yes.

22:56.342 --> 22:56.941
and you never
want to be forgetful.

22:56.942 --> 22:57.541
- Yes.

22:57.543 --> 22:58.909
- You wore that kind of,
sort of beige nude under it.

22:58.910 --> 23:00.276
- Yes.

23:00.279 --> 23:01.979
It was a bit sort of
granny on her honeymoon.

23:01.980 --> 23:03.680
- Yes.

23:03.683 --> 23:05.116
But it just looked like
it needed a good boil wash.

23:05.117 --> 23:06.550
- Yes.

23:06.552 --> 23:06.867
- Okay.

23:06.868 --> 23:07.183
- Yes.

23:07.186 --> 23:08.636
- But I love this bell-bottom
look that you have going on.

23:08.637 --> 23:10.087
- Yes.

23:10.089 --> 23:11.739
I think it really accents
your womanly shape.

23:11.740 --> 23:13.390
- Yes.

23:13.393 --> 23:14.075
- All right.
Thanks, Roxxxy.

23:14.076 --> 23:14.758
- Yes.

23:14.761 --> 23:16.611
- Thank you.
- Up next, Comrade Katya.

23:16.612 --> 23:18.462
- Yes.

23:18.798 --> 23:20.431
- (Russian accent)
Riddled with anxiety?

23:20.433 --> 23:22.483
Crippled under the burden
of existential pain?

23:22.484 --> 23:24.534
- (Russian accent)
Riddled with anxiety?

23:24.537 --> 23:25.136
(groans)

23:25.137 --> 23:25.736
- (Russian accent)
Riddled with anxiety?

23:25.738 --> 23:27.104
Hello, my name
is Katya Zimuchkiva.

23:27.105 --> 23:28.471
- (Russian accent)
Riddled with anxiety?

23:28.474 --> 23:30.341
You know, these days,
being a woman is tough.

23:30.342 --> 23:32.209
- (Russian accent)
Riddled with anxiety?

23:32.211 --> 23:33.361
When I'm not struggling
with my weight

23:33.362 --> 23:34.512
- (Russian accent)
Riddled with anxiety?

23:34.514 --> 23:35.246
or worried about wrinkles,

23:35.247 --> 23:35.979
- (Russian accent)
Riddled with anxiety?

23:35.982 --> 23:36.931
I am bombarded
by a cacophony

23:36.932 --> 23:37.881
- (Russian accent)
Riddled with anxiety?

23:37.884 --> 23:38.933
of demonic voices
in my head telling me...

23:38.934 --> 23:39.983
- (Russian accent)
Riddled with anxiety?

23:39.986 --> 23:41.102
(deep voice)
you're not good enough.

23:41.103 --> 23:42.219
- (Russian accent)
Riddled with anxiety?

23:42.221 --> 23:43.938
That's why I created
Crisis Control,

23:43.939 --> 23:45.656
- (Russian accent)
Riddled with anxiety?

23:45.658 --> 23:47.024
a moisturizing body spray
that provides relief,

23:47.025 --> 23:48.391
- (Russian accent)
Riddled with anxiety?

23:48.394 --> 23:51.112
while heavy doses of thorazine
shield the psyche from pain.

23:51.113 --> 23:53.831
- (Russian accent)
Riddled with anxiety?

23:53.833 --> 23:55.800
So go ahead,
control yourself.

23:55.801 --> 23:57.768
- (Russian accent)
Riddled with anxiety?

24:01.841 --> 24:04.542
(laughter and applause)

24:04.544 --> 24:05.476
- That is ge-nee-us.

24:05.477 --> 24:06.409
(laughter and applause)

24:06.412 --> 24:06.994
Your commercial
is brilliant,

24:06.995 --> 24:07.577
(laughter and applause)

24:07.580 --> 24:08.946
just very, very funny
the whole way through.

24:08.947 --> 24:10.313
(laughter and applause)

24:10.316 --> 24:11.532
- You were really working
within your whorehouse--

24:11.533 --> 24:12.749
(laughter and applause)

24:12.752 --> 24:13.468
I mean, wheelhouse.
- (laughs)

24:13.469 --> 24:14.185
(laughter and applause)

24:14.187 --> 24:15.687
- Let's talk about
this runway look.

24:15.688 --> 24:17.188
(laughter and applause)

24:17.190 --> 24:17.672
You looked gorgeous.

24:17.673 --> 24:18.155
(laughter and applause)

24:18.157 --> 24:19.557
You really, like, were modeling
the shit out of it.

24:19.558 --> 24:20.958
(laughter and applause)

24:20.960 --> 24:22.526
- The outfit is so wrong,
it's right.

24:22.527 --> 24:24.093
(laughter and applause)

24:24.096 --> 24:24.678
- Everything you did,
your commercial,

24:24.679 --> 24:25.261
(laughter and applause)

24:25.264 --> 24:26.547
your product and your look
are on brand.

24:26.548 --> 24:27.831
(laughter and applause)

24:27.834 --> 24:28.433
- Thank you.

24:28.434 --> 24:29.033
(laughter and applause)

24:29.035 --> 24:31.219
- Up next, Alyssa Edwards.

24:31.220 --> 24:33.404
(laughter and applause)

24:34.207 --> 24:35.372
- My fellow Americans.

24:35.374 --> 24:37.258
Now, I know you've all
been dying to know my secret

24:37.259 --> 24:39.143
- My fellow Americans.

24:39.145 --> 24:42.446
and I'm here to share with you
the latest energy enhancer, DDG,

24:42.447 --> 24:45.748
- My fellow Americans.

24:45.751 --> 24:46.584
Drop Dead Gorgeous,

24:46.585 --> 24:47.418

24:47.420 --> 24:48.286
that puts the go in go-go.

24:48.287 --> 24:49.153
- My fellow Americans.

24:49.155 --> 24:50.605
So if you're looking
to refuel your life

24:50.606 --> 24:52.056

24:52.058 --> 24:53.941
and get a nice good kick
and a boost,

24:53.942 --> 24:55.825

24:56.845 --> 24:57.861
- My fellow Americans.

24:57.864 --> 24:59.964
when you can spring up
and be Drop Dead Gorgeous?

24:59.965 --> 25:02.065
- My fellow Americans.

25:02.068 --> 25:04.185
Not only am I a consumer,
I'm also the president.

25:04.186 --> 25:06.303
- My fellow Americans.

25:06.305 --> 25:07.772
(laughter and applause)

25:07.773 --> 25:09.240
- My fellow Americans.

25:09.242 --> 25:10.241
- So let's talk about
your runway look.

25:10.242 --> 25:11.241
- My fellow Americans.

25:11.244 --> 25:12.593
I love it. I think you look
like Cruella DeVille

25:12.594 --> 25:13.943
- My fellow Americans.

25:13.946 --> 25:14.779
decided to go
all the way black.

25:14.780 --> 25:15.613
- My fellow Americans.

25:15.615 --> 25:16.981
And once you go black...
- You never go back.

25:16.982 --> 25:18.348
- My fellow Americans.

25:18.351 --> 25:19.434
- The commercial.

25:19.435 --> 25:20.518
- My fellow Americans.

25:20.520 --> 25:21.452
Why were you in front
of the White House?

25:21.453 --> 25:22.385
- My fellow Americans.

25:22.388 --> 25:24.305
- For my season, I tried
to develop a perfume.

25:24.306 --> 25:26.223
- My fellow Americans.

25:26.225 --> 25:26.907
- Oh, I know. I've seen.
- Okay.

25:26.908 --> 25:27.590
- My fellow Americans.

25:27.593 --> 25:28.743
The Americans
have been asking me

25:28.744 --> 25:29.894
- My fellow Americans.

25:29.896 --> 25:30.912
for the last three years,
what is really your secret?

25:30.913 --> 25:31.929
- My fellow Americans.

25:31.931 --> 25:32.930
So I was doing
a press conference.

25:32.931 --> 25:33.930
- My fellow Americans.

25:33.933 --> 25:34.432
- I thought
it was all about

25:34.433 --> 25:34.932
- My fellow Americans.

25:34.934 --> 25:35.600
you being the president
of the company.

25:35.601 --> 25:36.267
- My fellow Americans.

25:36.269 --> 25:37.618
- Yeah, that, too.
(all laugh)

25:37.619 --> 25:38.968
- My fellow Americans.

25:38.971 --> 25:40.805
Fortunately, everyone was
laughing when it was airing,

25:40.806 --> 25:42.640
- My fellow Americans.

25:42.642 --> 25:43.458
so you got the job done.

25:43.459 --> 25:44.275
- My fellow Americans.

25:44.277 --> 25:45.093
- I love the energy drink.
I think it will sell.

25:45.094 --> 25:45.910
- My fellow Americans.

25:45.912 --> 25:47.178
I think you should've called it
Tongue Pop, though.

25:47.179 --> 25:48.445
- My fellow Americans.

25:48.447 --> 25:48.712
- Okay.

25:48.713 --> 25:48.978
- My fellow Americans.

25:48.981 --> 25:49.897
- Give me some of that
Tongue Pop, baby.

25:49.898 --> 25:50.814
- My fellow Americans.

25:50.816 --> 25:51.131
- Okay.

25:51.132 --> 25:51.447
- My fellow Americans.

25:51.450 --> 25:51.982
- I'm a marketing genius.

25:51.983 --> 25:52.515
- My fellow Americans.

25:52.518 --> 25:53.317
I marketed subversive drag

25:53.318 --> 25:54.117
- My fellow Americans.

25:54.120 --> 25:54.836
to 100 million motherfuckers
in the world.

25:54.837 --> 25:55.553
- My fellow Americans.

25:55.555 --> 25:58.139
I'm a marketing motherfucking
genius over here.

25:58.140 --> 26:00.724
- My fellow Americans.

26:00.726 --> 26:02.059
Up next, Detox.

26:02.060 --> 26:03.393

26:09.302 --> 26:11.085
here with Detox's
Talking Trash trash receptacle.

26:11.086 --> 26:12.869
- Oh, hey, there,
it's me, Detox,

26:12.872 --> 26:14.639
Hi, Detox.
Oh.

26:14.640 --> 26:16.407
- Oh, hey, there,
it's me, Detox,

26:16.409 --> 26:17.325
Detox's Trash Talking

26:17.326 --> 26:18.242
- Oh, hey, there,
it's me, Detox,

26:18.244 --> 26:20.044
has many catch phrases,
such as...

26:20.045 --> 26:21.845
- Oh, hey, there,
it's me, Detox,

26:24.951 --> 26:28.319
And new takes on

is made of 100% plastic.

26:34.876 --> 26:35.892
Detox's Trash Talking

26:35.895 --> 26:36.944
More plastic than me!

26:36.945 --> 26:37.994
Detox's Trash Talking
trash receptacle

26:37.997 --> 26:39.797
Only 35.99,

26:39.798 --> 26:41.598

26:44.853 --> 26:45.936
Detox's Trash Talking
trash receptacle

26:45.938 --> 26:47.121
It's sort of fresh.
It's continental.

26:47.122 --> 26:48.305
Detox's Trash Talking
trash receptacle

26:48.307 --> 26:49.306
It's a real kind of head turner
on the catwalk.

26:49.307 --> 26:50.306
Detox's Trash Talking
trash receptacle

26:50.309 --> 26:51.292
- I thoroughly enjoyed
the commercial.

26:51.293 --> 26:52.276
Detox's Trash Talking
trash receptacle

26:52.278 --> 26:53.728
A trashy trash can

26:53.729 --> 26:55.179
Detox's Trash Talking
trash receptacle

26:55.181 --> 26:55.796
- One of the things
that bothered me

26:55.797 --> 26:56.412
Detox's Trash Talking
trash receptacle

26:56.415 --> 26:57.014
is that you were moving
your hand there.

26:57.015 --> 26:57.614
Detox's Trash Talking
trash receptacle

26:57.617 --> 26:59.567
Then it became like
a ventriloquist type of moment,

26:59.568 --> 27:01.518
Detox's Trash Talking
trash receptacle

27:01.520 --> 27:02.303
where it wasn't
supposed to be.

27:02.304 --> 27:03.087
Detox's Trash Talking
trash receptacle

27:03.089 --> 27:03.738
- It's just so ugly.

27:03.739 --> 27:04.388
Detox's Trash Talking
trash receptacle

27:04.390 --> 27:05.439
I know
it's just a prototype,

27:05.440 --> 27:06.489
Detox's Trash Talking
trash receptacle

27:06.492 --> 27:07.391
but it's a really
piss-poor prototype.

27:07.392 --> 27:08.291
Detox's Trash Talking
trash receptacle

27:08.294 --> 27:09.343
- He didn't mean it.

27:09.344 --> 27:10.393
Detox's Trash Talking
trash receptacle

27:10.396 --> 27:11.195
- I did.

Detox's Trash Talking

27:11.998 --> 27:12.847
- All right.

27:17.919 --> 27:18.801
Detox's Trash Talking

27:19.071 --> 27:23.874
In a world of oppression,
I speak my mind.

27:23.876 --> 27:24.708
(deep voice) Anus.

27:24.709 --> 27:25.541
In a world of oppression,
I speak my mind.

27:25.544 --> 27:27.678
That's why I use Alaska
Thunderfun Fashion Tape.

27:27.679 --> 27:29.813
In a world of oppression,
I speak my mind.

27:29.815 --> 27:31.715
What makes this product
different, you might ask?

27:31.716 --> 27:33.616
In a world of oppression,
I speak my mind.

27:33.619 --> 27:35.202
That's a stupid question.

27:35.203 --> 27:36.786
In a world of oppression,
I speak my mind.

27:36.789 --> 27:37.922
It makes you beautiful.

27:37.923 --> 27:39.056
In a world of oppression,
I speak my mind.

27:39.058 --> 27:39.707
Ooh, tighter.

27:39.708 --> 27:40.357
In a world of oppression,
I speak my mind.

27:40.359 --> 27:41.425
It makes you fashionable.

27:41.426 --> 27:42.492
In a world of oppression,
I speak my mind.

27:42.495 --> 27:44.645
And it costs
lots of lots of money.

27:44.646 --> 27:46.796
In a world of oppression,
I speak my mind.

27:46.799 --> 27:48.099
(whispering) I'm so rich.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.400
In a world of oppression,
I speak my mind.

27:49.402 --> 27:51.552
Available
in three unique shades...

27:51.553 --> 27:53.703
In a world of oppression,
I speak my mind.

27:56.642 --> 28:00.411
Alaska Thunderfun

28:00.413 --> 28:02.263
Anus-thing is possible.

28:02.264 --> 28:04.114
Alaska Thunderfun

28:06.185 --> 28:06.917
- I had high hopes
for your commercial,

28:06.918 --> 28:07.650
Alaska Thunderfun
Fashion Tape.

28:07.653 --> 28:08.269
and you really
didn't disappoint.

28:08.270 --> 28:08.886
Alaska Thunderfun
Fashion Tape.

28:08.888 --> 28:10.471
It was properly funny,
really kind of captured

28:10.472 --> 28:12.055
Alaska Thunderfun
Fashion Tape.

28:12.058 --> 28:13.608
that sort of pretentious
1990s perfume ad,

28:13.609 --> 28:15.159
Alaska Thunderfun
Fashion Tape.

28:15.161 --> 28:15.676
like an old legal tease.

28:15.677 --> 28:16.192
Alaska Thunderfun
Fashion Tape.

28:16.195 --> 28:16.794
It was very, very good.

28:16.795 --> 28:17.394
Alaska Thunderfun

28:17.396 --> 28:18.229
- You had so much
to get through,

28:18.230 --> 28:19.063
Alaska Thunderfun
Fashion Tape.

28:19.065 --> 28:19.881
but you were able
to change on time.

28:19.882 --> 28:20.698
Alaska Thunderfun
Fashion Tape.

28:20.700 --> 28:21.999
- You, like, Spielberged

it's what I love to do.

28:23.935 --> 28:24.567

28:24.570 --> 28:25.753
It's, like, my passion
and it's my calling.

28:25.754 --> 28:26.937
Alaska Thunderfun

28:26.939 --> 28:28.122

28:30.859 --> 28:32.409
Alaska Thunderfun

Do you spreading rumors?

28:42.688 --> 28:43.721
Do you like
just talking shit?

28:43.722 --> 28:44.755

28:44.757 --> 28:45.539
If so, then you're in luck.

28:54.066 --> 28:54.832

- Do you like gossip?

28:58.404 --> 28:59.687
(laughs) Choices.

like coffee, cocoa or sake.

You also receive

- Do you like gossip?

29:30.202 --> 29:31.385
- On the runway, you came out
and we were gagging.

- Do you like gossip?

29:32.571 --> 29:33.404
I mean, it's really good.
- Thank you.

29:33.405 --> 29:34.238

really charming.

29:51.039 --> 29:51.755
- Do you like gossip?

29:51.757 --> 29:54.241
What you didn't do
is really feature the product.

29:54.242 --> 29:56.726
- Do you like gossip?

29:56.729 --> 29:57.128
That was a miss for me.

29:57.129 --> 29:57.528
- Do you like gossip?

29:57.530 --> 29:58.295
- I saw
what you were going for,

29:58.296 --> 29:59.061
- Do you like gossip?

29:59.064 --> 30:00.481
but I felt like maybe you
didn't get all the way there.

30:00.482 --> 30:01.899
- Do you like gossip?

30:01.901 --> 30:02.867
- Gotcha.
- Thank you, ladies.

30:02.868 --> 30:03.834
- Do you like gossip?

30:03.836 --> 30:04.502
I think we've heard enough.

30:04.503 --> 30:05.169
- Do you like gossip?

30:05.171 --> 30:07.238
I've made
some business decisions.

30:07.239 --> 30:09.306
- Do you like gossip?

30:10.309 --> 30:14.344
Alaska, Katya,
con-drag-ulations.

30:14.346 --> 30:16.146
You are the two top AllStars
of the week.

30:16.147 --> 30:17.947
Alaska, Katya,
con-drag-ulations.

30:17.950 --> 30:21.368
You've each won a custom wig
wardrobe from Weaven Steven.

30:21.369 --> 30:24.787
Alaska, Katya,
con-drag-ulations.

30:24.790 --> 30:25.072
- Oh!

30:25.073 --> 30:25.355
Alaska, Katya,
con-drag-ulations.

30:25.357 --> 30:27.658
- Plus, a limited edition
of your AllStar merch

30:27.659 --> 30:29.960
Alaska, Katya,
con-drag-ulations.

30:29.962 --> 30:32.496
will be available at
the upcoming RuPaul's Drag Con.

30:32.497 --> 30:35.031
Alaska, Katya,
con-drag-ulations.

30:35.034 --> 30:36.684
- Yes.
(applause)

30:36.685 --> 30:38.335
Alaska, Katya,
con-drag-ulations.

30:38.337 --> 30:40.654
- Alyssa Edwards, Detox,

30:40.655 --> 30:42.972
Alaska, Katya,
con-drag-ulations.

30:42.975 --> 30:44.108
you are safe.

30:44.109 --> 30:45.242
Alaska, Katya,
con-drag-ulations.

30:45.244 --> 30:48.095
That means Roxxxy Andrews
and Tatianna,

30:48.096 --> 30:50.947
Alaska, Katya,
con-drag-ulations.

30:50.950 --> 30:51.999
you're the bottom two.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.049
Alaska, Katya,
con-drag-ulations.

30:54.820 --> 30:59.723
Alaska, Katya, each of you
needs to decide

30:59.725 --> 31:01.025
which of the bottom two
you'll eliminate

31:01.026 --> 31:02.326
Alaska, Katya, each of you
needs to decide

31:02.328 --> 31:04.061
if you win the lip sync.

31:04.062 --> 31:05.795
Alaska, Katya, each of you
needs to decide

31:06.031 --> 31:09.633
So while you queens
deliberate in the workroom,

31:09.635 --> 31:11.185
the judges and I
will be skeet shooting.

31:11.186 --> 31:12.736
So while you queens
deliberate in the workroom,

31:12.738 --> 31:14.121
- I don't know
what that means.

31:14.122 --> 31:15.505
So while you queens
deliberate in the workroom,

31:15.507 --> 31:17.124
- You may leave the stage.

31:17.125 --> 31:18.742
So while you queens
deliberate in the workroom,

31:19.612 --> 31:20.377
Coming up...

31:20.379 --> 31:21.445
- Who the fuck
do I send home tonight?

31:21.446 --> 31:22.512
Coming up...

31:22.514 --> 31:23.497
Roxxxy's been in the bottom
however many times,

31:23.498 --> 31:24.481
Coming up...

31:24.483 --> 31:26.066
but Tatianna hasn't
been here the whole time.

31:26.067 --> 31:27.650
Coming up...

31:29.455 --> 31:32.022
(RuPaul laughs)

31:32.892 --> 31:35.826
(RuPaul laughs)

31:36.662 --> 31:39.029
- (sighs)

31:39.031 --> 31:39.513
This is bizarre,

31:39.514 --> 31:39.996
- (sighs)

31:39.999 --> 31:41.866
because it is the same
exact top and bottom two

31:41.867 --> 31:43.734
- (sighs)

31:43.736 --> 31:44.235
from the Snatch Game
episode.

31:44.236 --> 31:44.735
- (sighs)

31:44.737 --> 31:47.238
- We're lip synching yet again
against one another.

31:47.239 --> 31:49.740
- (sighs)

31:49.742 --> 31:50.257
- And we're in the bottom.

31:50.258 --> 31:50.773
- (sighs)

31:50.776 --> 31:51.291
- With those two
in the bottom.

31:51.292 --> 31:51.807
- (sighs)

31:51.810 --> 31:53.043
- Oh, my God. I didn't
even think about that.

31:53.044 --> 31:54.277
- (sighs)

31:54.280 --> 31:54.962
- It's déjà vu
all over again.

31:54.963 --> 31:55.645
- (sighs)

31:55.648 --> 31:56.580
Let's hope
that this doesn't go

31:56.581 --> 31:57.513
- (sighs)

31:57.516 --> 31:58.315
the way that it did
the first time around.

31:58.316 --> 31:59.115
- (sighs)

31:59.118 --> 32:01.001
- I'd like to talk one on one
with you guys if you want to.

32:01.002 --> 32:02.885
- (sighs)

32:02.888 --> 32:03.554
- Sure.
- I'll be over there.

32:03.555 --> 32:04.221
- (sighs)

32:04.223 --> 32:05.205
- Fuel.
- Actually, Detox,

32:05.206 --> 32:06.188
- (sighs)

32:06.191 --> 32:07.541
can we talk,
like, over there?

32:07.542 --> 32:08.892
- (sighs)

32:08.894 --> 32:09.526
- Sure.

32:09.527 --> 32:10.159
- (sighs)

32:13.098 --> 32:15.132
- Who the fuck
do I send home tonight?

32:15.134 --> 32:15.783
- I don't want to see
my sister go home,

32:15.784 --> 32:16.433
- Who the fuck
do I send home tonight?

32:16.435 --> 32:17.685
but out of who's left, she's
been in the bottom the most.

32:17.686 --> 32:18.936
- Who the fuck
do I send home tonight?

32:18.938 --> 32:20.271
- Roxxxy's been in the bottom
however many times,

32:20.272 --> 32:21.605
- Who the fuck
do I send home tonight?

32:21.607 --> 32:22.589
but Tatianna hasn't been here
the whole time.

32:22.590 --> 32:23.572
- Who the fuck
do I send home tonight?

32:23.575 --> 32:25.242
- She's missed two challenges
until her return.

32:25.243 --> 32:26.910
- Who the fuck
do I send home tonight?

32:26.912 --> 32:27.978
- I need to hear these hos.

32:27.979 --> 32:29.045
- Who the fuck
do I send home tonight?

32:29.048 --> 32:29.647
- So before we start,

32:29.648 --> 32:30.247
- Who the fuck
do I send home tonight?

32:30.249 --> 32:30.914
I just want to give you
a couple of moments

32:30.915 --> 32:31.580
- Who the fuck
do I send home tonight?

32:31.583 --> 32:32.983
to give me some compliments
about my outfit.

32:32.984 --> 32:34.384
- Who the fuck
do I send home tonight?

32:34.386 --> 32:35.619
- Uh, living.

32:35.620 --> 32:36.853
- Who the fuck
do I send home tonight?

32:36.855 --> 32:37.387
- (laughs)

32:37.388 --> 32:37.920
- Who the fuck
do I send home tonight?

32:37.923 --> 32:38.322
- Living out loud.

32:38.323 --> 32:38.722
- Who the fuck
do I send home tonight?

32:38.724 --> 32:39.440
- I'm so glad you did that
on the runway.

32:39.441 --> 32:40.157
- Who the fuck
do I send home tonight?

32:40.159 --> 32:40.975
- Thank you.
- How are you feeling?

32:40.976 --> 32:41.792
- Who the fuck
do I send home tonight?

32:41.794 --> 32:43.878
- I know that maybe
I tripped on this challenge,

32:43.879 --> 32:45.963
- Who the fuck
do I send home tonight?

32:45.965 --> 32:46.297
but the next one

32:46.298 --> 32:46.630
- Who the fuck
do I send home tonight?

32:46.632 --> 32:47.898
I'm going to fucking pick
that shit up and keep going.

32:47.899 --> 32:49.165
- Who the fuck
do I send home tonight?

32:49.168 --> 32:50.935
I definitely think that
I was brought back for a reason.

32:50.936 --> 32:52.703
- Who the fuck
do I send home tonight?

32:52.705 --> 32:54.054
I've been given
a second chance,

32:54.055 --> 32:55.404
- Who the fuck
do I send home tonight?

32:55.407 --> 32:56.323
and I want
to fucking be here.

32:56.324 --> 32:57.240
- Who the fuck
do I send home tonight?

32:57.242 --> 32:58.625
I really think that my
performance speaks for itself.

32:58.626 --> 33:00.009
- Who the fuck
do I send home tonight?

33:00.012 --> 33:01.745
Roxxxy's commercial was not
as entertaining as mine,

33:01.746 --> 33:03.479
- Who the fuck
do I send home tonight?

33:03.482 --> 33:04.765
and my runway look
was better.

33:04.766 --> 33:06.049
- Who the fuck
do I send home tonight?

33:06.618 --> 33:07.951
- How are you feeling,
honey?

33:07.953 --> 33:09.286
- You know what, I'm so thankful
to still be here.

33:09.287 --> 33:10.620
- How are you feeling,
honey?

33:10.622 --> 33:11.822
At the end of the day,
I don't feel like

33:11.823 --> 33:13.023
- How are you feeling,
honey?

33:13.025 --> 33:14.541
I got the harshest critiques
like usually.

33:14.542 --> 33:16.058
- How are you feeling,
honey?

33:16.061 --> 33:16.843
And I don't know
if this is my time,

33:16.844 --> 33:17.626
- How are you feeling,
honey?

33:17.629 --> 33:18.829
but God does, so we'll see
what he decides for me.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.030
- How are you feeling,
honey?

33:20.032 --> 33:23.017
And regardless of what happens,
I am so proud of you.

33:23.018 --> 33:26.003
- How are you feeling,
honey?

33:26.005 --> 33:26.670
- Thank you.

33:26.671 --> 33:27.336
- How are you feeling,
honey?

33:27.339 --> 33:28.789
Thanks for letting me
borrow this top.

33:28.790 --> 33:30.240
- How are you feeling,
honey?

33:30.242 --> 33:30.958
- You're welcome.

33:30.959 --> 33:31.675
- How are you feeling,
honey?

33:31.677 --> 33:32.593
I've fallen in the bottom
so much,

33:32.594 --> 33:33.510
- How are you feeling,
honey?

33:33.512 --> 33:34.745
my drive is a little lacking
right now.

33:34.746 --> 33:35.979
- How are you feeling,
honey?

33:35.981 --> 33:37.231
But I feel like my commercial
was better than Tatianna's,

33:37.232 --> 33:38.482
- How are you feeling,
honey?

33:38.484 --> 33:40.734
so if we're sticking true
to our plan, I should be fine.

33:40.735 --> 33:42.985
- How are you feeling,
honey?

33:42.988 --> 33:43.403
- How are you feeling?

33:43.404 --> 33:43.819
- How are you feeling,
honey?

33:43.822 --> 33:44.821
- I felt like
I had a great commercial,

33:44.822 --> 33:45.821
- How are you feeling,
honey?

33:45.824 --> 33:47.291
but what I've been giving
has landed me in the bottom,

33:47.292 --> 33:48.759
- How are you feeling,
honey?

33:48.761 --> 33:50.611
so I don't know
what else I can do, you know?

33:50.612 --> 33:52.462
- How are you feeling,
honey?

33:52.464 --> 33:53.814
If you decide me, no T.

33:53.815 --> 33:55.165
- How are you feeling,
honey?

33:55.167 --> 33:57.000
If you decide to keep me,
no T.

33:57.001 --> 33:58.834
- How are you feeling,
honey?

33:58.837 --> 34:00.087
It's up to you.
I don't care either way.

34:00.088 --> 34:01.338
- How are you feeling,
honey?

34:01.340 --> 34:02.356
I've been in the bottom
four times.

34:02.357 --> 34:03.373
- How are you feeling,
honey?

34:04.410 --> 34:06.276
- If you're not trying
to express

34:06.278 --> 34:06.977
how much
you want to stay here,

34:06.978 --> 34:07.677
- If you're not trying
to express

34:07.679 --> 34:09.012
that must mean that you're
kind of ready to hit it.

34:09.013 --> 34:10.346
- If you're not trying
to express

34:10.349 --> 34:11.765
And to that, I say hit it.

34:11.766 --> 34:13.182
- If you're not trying
to express

34:13.185 --> 34:14.034
- All right, well...

34:14.035 --> 34:14.884
- If you're not trying
to express

34:14.887 --> 34:15.486
- I love you. Mmm.
- Love you, too.

34:15.487 --> 34:16.086
- If you're not trying
to express

34:16.088 --> 34:18.288
- Based on my last experience,
Alaska didn't send Roxxxy home,

34:18.289 --> 34:20.489
- If you're not trying
to express

34:20.492 --> 34:22.476
and that's an alliance
that's very evident now.

34:22.477 --> 34:24.461
- If you're not trying
to express

34:24.463 --> 34:24.728
- Girl.

34:24.729 --> 34:24.994
- If you're not trying
to express

34:24.997 --> 34:26.547
- Although, I'm not going out
without a fight at all.

34:26.548 --> 34:28.098
- If you're not trying
to express

34:28.100 --> 34:29.233
Today was possibly
a missed opportunity,

34:29.234 --> 34:30.367
- If you're not trying
to express

34:30.369 --> 34:31.068
but this isn't deterring me
from, like,

34:31.069 --> 34:31.768
- If you're not trying
to express

34:31.770 --> 34:33.337
wanting to fucking kick ass
in this fucking competition.

34:33.338 --> 34:34.905
- If you're not trying
to express

34:34.907 --> 34:35.773
I clawed my way
back in here.

34:35.774 --> 34:36.640
- If you're not trying
to express

34:36.642 --> 34:38.208
Like, that's a huge
fucking deal.

34:38.209 --> 34:39.775
- If you're not trying
to express

34:39.778 --> 34:41.161
So, yeah, I'm not ready to go
by any means.

34:41.162 --> 34:42.545
- If you're not trying
to express

34:42.548 --> 34:44.064
I will never say, oh,
what happens happens. No.

34:44.065 --> 34:45.581
- If you're not trying
to express

34:45.584 --> 34:47.000
To you, I say keep a bitch.

34:47.001 --> 34:48.417
- If you're not trying
to express

34:50.956 --> 34:53.190
- Pull!

34:53.192 --> 34:54.241
(rooster crows)

34:54.242 --> 34:55.291
- Pull!

34:55.294 --> 34:56.110
Ooh, I got it!

34:56.111 --> 34:56.927
- Pull!

34:56.929 --> 34:58.812
(laughter and applause)

34:58.813 --> 35:00.696
- Pull!

35:00.699 --> 35:02.332
All right, all right.
Silence.

35:02.333 --> 35:03.966
- Pull!

35:03.969 --> 35:05.602
Bring back my girls.

35:05.603 --> 35:07.236
- Pull!

35:10.709 --> 35:13.410
- After talking with Tatianna
and Roxxxy in the workroom,

35:13.412 --> 35:14.711
I kind of go with my gut
with this decision,

35:14.712 --> 35:16.011
- After talking with Tatianna
and Roxxxy in the workroom,

35:16.014 --> 35:17.531
and I feel
pretty comfortable.

35:17.532 --> 35:19.049
- After talking with Tatianna
and Roxxxy in the workroom,

35:21.220 --> 35:23.753
- I still have no idea

35:23.755 --> 35:25.822
whose lipstick
I'm going to choose.

35:25.823 --> 35:27.890
- I still have no idea

35:27.893 --> 35:28.542
If I send Tatianna home,

35:28.543 --> 35:29.192
- I still have no idea

35:29.194 --> 35:30.527
then people will say
that I'm favoring Roxxxy

35:30.528 --> 35:31.861
- I still have no idea

35:31.864 --> 35:32.763
because she's my friend.

35:32.764 --> 35:33.663
- I still have no idea

35:33.665 --> 35:34.731
If I send Roxxxy home,

35:34.732 --> 35:35.798
- I still have no idea

35:35.801 --> 35:36.867
then I'll look like
kind of a bitch

35:36.868 --> 35:37.934
- I still have no idea

35:37.936 --> 35:39.853
because she lent me
this shirt that I'm wearing.

35:39.854 --> 35:41.771
- I still have no idea

35:45.410 --> 35:48.178
(RuPaul laughs)

35:49.047 --> 35:52.015
(RuPaul laughs)

35:55.454 --> 35:57.020
- Welcome back, ladies.

35:57.022 --> 35:59.006
Two top AllStars
stand before me.

35:59.007 --> 36:00.991
- Welcome back, ladies.

36:00.993 --> 36:03.160
Ladies, this is your chance
to impress me,

36:03.161 --> 36:05.328
- Welcome back, ladies.

36:05.330 --> 36:07.097
win $10,000,
and earn the power

36:07.098 --> 36:08.865
- Welcome back, ladies.

36:08.867 --> 36:11.651
to give one of
the bottom queens the chop.

36:11.652 --> 36:14.436
- Welcome back, ladies.

36:15.440 --> 36:19.643
The time has come
to lip sync

36:19.645 --> 36:21.261
(echoing) for your legacy.

36:21.262 --> 36:22.878
The time has come
to lip sync

36:22.881 --> 36:25.015
- Katya's really amazing
at lip syncing.

36:25.016 --> 36:27.150
The time has come
to lip sync

36:27.152 --> 36:28.051
I beat her once before,

36:28.052 --> 36:28.951
The time has come
to lip sync

36:28.954 --> 36:30.404
but who knows what's
gonna happen this time?

36:30.405 --> 36:31.855
The time has come
to lip sync

36:31.857 --> 36:32.389
- Good luck,

36:32.390 --> 36:32.922
The time has come
to lip sync

36:32.925 --> 36:35.175
and don't fuck it up.

36:35.176 --> 36:37.426
The time has come
to lip sync

36:37.429 --> 36:38.979
(music plays)

36:38.980 --> 36:40.530
The time has come
to lip sync

36:40.532 --> 36:42.082
- ¶ Can't stay at home,
can't stay at school ¶

37:00.568 --> 37:02.418
The time has come

37:02.421 --> 37:04.221
¶ Stone age love
and strange sounds, too ¶

37:04.222 --> 37:06.022
The time has come
to lip sync

37:06.024 --> 37:08.125
¶ Come on, baby,
let me get into you ¶

37:08.126 --> 37:10.227
The time has come
to lip sync

37:10.229 --> 37:11.662
¶ Bad nights
causing teenage blues ¶

37:11.663 --> 37:13.096
The time has come

37:13.098 --> 37:15.298

38:12.090 --> 38:15.592
(laughter and applause)

38:19.698 --> 38:23.867
- Ladies,
I've made my decision.

38:26.872 --> 38:31.708
Alaska,
you are a winner, baby.

38:31.710 --> 38:32.376
- Thank you.

38:32.377 --> 38:33.043
Alaska,
you are a winner, baby.

38:33.045 --> 38:34.178
(applause)

38:34.179 --> 38:35.312
Alaska,
you are a winner, baby.

38:35.314 --> 38:35.829
- Con-drag-ulations.

38:35.830 --> 38:36.345
Alaska,
you are a winner, baby.

38:36.348 --> 38:38.765
You've earned a cash tip
of $10,000.

38:38.766 --> 38:41.183
Alaska,
you are a winner, baby.

38:41.186 --> 38:42.719
- Second time losing
the lip sync to Alaska.

38:42.720 --> 38:44.253
Alaska,
you are a winner, baby.

38:44.256 --> 38:45.656
Ugh. It sucks.

38:45.657 --> 38:47.057
Alaska,
you are a winner, baby.

38:47.059 --> 38:48.809
- Katya, you are safe.
- Thank you.

38:48.810 --> 38:50.560
Alaska,
you are a winner, baby.

38:50.562 --> 38:51.561
- You may join
the other girls.

38:51.562 --> 38:52.561
Alaska,
you are a winner, baby.

38:55.067 --> 38:59.969
Will the bottom two
please step forward?

39:02.140 --> 39:07.110
Alaska, with great power
comes great responsibility.

39:07.112 --> 39:09.496
Which queen have you chosen
to get the chop?

39:09.497 --> 39:11.881
Alaska, with great power
comes great responsibility.

39:11.883 --> 39:13.400
- One of these queens,
week after week,

39:13.401 --> 39:14.918
Alaska, with great power
comes great responsibility.

39:14.920 --> 39:17.404
has brought a level
of prestige and beauty

39:17.405 --> 39:19.889
Alaska, with great power
comes great responsibility.

39:19.891 --> 39:21.341
and excellence
to this runway

39:21.342 --> 39:22.792
Alaska, with great power
comes great responsibility.

39:22.794 --> 39:24.160
and to the art form
of drag.

39:24.161 --> 39:25.527
Alaska, with great power
comes great responsibility.

39:25.530 --> 39:26.296
And one of these queens
is the person

39:26.297 --> 39:27.063
Alaska, with great power
comes great responsibility.

39:27.065 --> 39:28.565
who lent me this very shirt
that I'm wearing tonight.

39:28.566 --> 39:30.066
Alaska, with great power
comes great responsibility.

39:30.068 --> 39:32.469
So based on that,
I've chosen...

39:32.470 --> 39:34.871
Alaska, with great power
comes great responsibility.

39:38.343 --> 39:40.410
Tatianna.

39:43.515 --> 39:45.782
Tatianna, I think
you're stunning.

39:45.784 --> 39:46.099
- Thanks.

39:46.100 --> 39:46.415
Tatianna, I think
you're stunning.

39:46.418 --> 39:48.201
- As it is written,
so it shall be done.

39:48.202 --> 39:49.985
Tatianna, I think
you're stunning.

39:49.988 --> 39:51.855
Tatianna,
you are an AllStar.

39:51.856 --> 39:53.723
Tatianna, I think
you're stunning.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.859
Now sashay away.

39:55.860 --> 39:57.994
Tatianna, I think
you're stunning.

39:57.996 --> 39:59.129
- Thank you.

39:59.130 --> 40:00.263
Tatianna, I think
you're stunning.

40:00.265 --> 40:02.265
- Thank you.
(all laugh)

40:02.266 --> 40:04.266
Tatianna, I think
you're stunning.

40:10.308 --> 40:14.177
(laughter and applause)

40:14.880 --> 40:17.080
- Even though
I didn't get to feature

40:17.082 --> 40:17.914
everything that I wanted to,

40:17.915 --> 40:18.747
- Even though
I didn't get to feature

40:18.750 --> 40:20.183
I think I showed a lot
while I was here.

40:20.184 --> 40:21.617
- Even though
I didn't get to feature

40:21.620 --> 40:22.219
I got to introduce myself

40:22.220 --> 40:22.819
- Even though
I didn't get to feature

40:22.821 --> 40:24.287
to people who didn't know
who Tatianna was,

40:24.288 --> 40:25.754
- Even though
I didn't get to feature

40:25.757 --> 40:27.207
and I got to impress
the people

40:27.208 --> 40:28.658
- Even though
I didn't get to feature

40:28.660 --> 40:29.943
who have been my supporters
from the jump.

40:29.944 --> 40:31.227
- Even though
I didn't get to feature

40:31.229 --> 40:32.712
And that,
I'm very proud of.

40:32.713 --> 40:34.196
- Even though
I didn't get to feature

40:34.199 --> 40:35.081
Thank you.

40:35.082 --> 40:35.964
- Even though
I didn't get to feature

40:36.968 --> 40:40.603
- My fierce five,
con-drag-ulations.

40:40.605 --> 40:43.156
You're one step closer to
the Drag Race Hall of Fame.

40:43.157 --> 40:45.708
- My fierce five,
con-drag-ulations.

40:45.710 --> 40:47.093
Now, remember,
if you can't love yourself,

40:47.094 --> 40:48.477
- My fierce five,
con-drag-ulations.

40:48.480 --> 40:49.396
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

40:49.397 --> 40:50.313
- My fierce five,
con-drag-ulations.

40:50.315 --> 40:51.231
Can I get an amen
up in here?

40:51.232 --> 40:52.148
- My fierce five,
con-drag-ulations.

40:52.150 --> 40:52.549
- Amen!
- Amen!

40:52.550 --> 40:52.949
- My fierce five,
con-drag-ulations.

40:52.951 --> 40:54.284
- All right.
Now, let the music play.

40:54.285 --> 40:55.618
- My fierce five,
con-drag-ulations.

40:55.620 --> 40:56.586
- ¶ Throw you hands up ¶

40:56.587 --> 40:57.553
- My fierce five,
con-drag-ulations.

40:57.556 --> 40:58.505
¶ Time to get down ¶

40:58.506 --> 40:59.455
- My fierce five,
con-drag-ulations.

40:59.458 --> 41:01.391
¶ Time to get down,
down, down, down, down ¶

41:01.392 --> 41:03.325
- My fierce five,
con-drag-ulations.

41:03.328 --> 41:04.661
¶ Throw your hands up ¶

41:04.662 --> 41:05.995
- My fierce five,
con-drag-ulations.
