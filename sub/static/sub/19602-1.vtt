00:22.355 --> 00:24.355
Thanks.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.878
Here.

00:47.514 --> 00:49.514
Sorry.

00:56.322 --> 01:00.402
-That was quick.
-I sat next to the wrong person.

01:00.460 --> 01:05.090
-Really? Where?
-Don't look! Don't look!

01:05.197 --> 01:07.198
Careful of my jacket.

01:47.173 --> 01:49.432
Will the wedding be crowded?

01:49.442 --> 01:51.442
I don't know.

01:51.911 --> 01:55.141
I don't think
she knows anyone anymore.

01:55.248 --> 01:57.807
She's only known this guy a year.

01:57.817 --> 01:59.142
Is that short?

01:59.152 --> 02:03.147
Would you marry someone
you'd only known a year?

02:04.023 --> 02:08.283
I can't say I have a lot of hope
for the whole thing.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.985
Then why are we going then?

02:09.996 --> 02:13.590
-We're supporting her.
-I thought she wasn't speaking to you.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.600
No.

02:15.768 --> 02:19.338
I wasn't speaking to her, but I'm over it.

02:19.906 --> 02:22.116
I'm never getting married.

02:50.403 --> 02:52.996
Why aren't you wearing
your new shades?

02:53.006 --> 02:54.831
I don't think I need them right now.

02:54.841 --> 02:57.306
You begged for those glasses.

03:06.252 --> 03:08.252
You look very cool.

03:11.791 --> 03:14.171
I don't need them right now.

03:20.166 --> 03:22.206
Do they know we're here?

03:23.469 --> 03:25.469
Yes.

03:40.119 --> 03:41.211
Are you...

03:41.221 --> 03:46.115
Paul apologizes for not coming.
She's still getting the house ready.

03:46.125 --> 03:48.551
I'm sorry it was such short notice.

03:48.561 --> 03:52.555
I don't care.
Paul's frantic, but I don't give a shit.

03:52.565 --> 03:55.491
And Ingrid wants me to tell you
that she made us all bracelets.

03:55.501 --> 03:56.893
No, I said we should wait.

03:56.903 --> 04:01.731
I thought you asked me to tell them.
Anyway, I got Knicks colors.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.266
They're not Knicks colors!

04:03.276 --> 04:05.276
It's beautiful, Ingrid.

04:05.445 --> 04:08.137
-Where's your dad and Josh?
-They might come later.

04:08.147 --> 04:11.808
Josh's spring break is next week,
and then Jim teaches through Friday.

04:11.818 --> 04:14.611
Then he opens the house
in Vermont on the weekend.

04:14.621 --> 04:17.247
It means a lot to Pauline that you came.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.915
Good.

04:18.925 --> 04:22.019
Holy Jesus! Watch it, dicksack!

04:23.496 --> 04:25.496
God!

04:26.933 --> 04:28.992
If you're wondering about
the mustache...

04:29.002 --> 04:30.093
No, I wasn't.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.629
I had a full beard for a while,
and then when I shaved it

04:32.639 --> 04:36.733
I left this part for last, you know,
to see how it looked.

04:36.743 --> 04:38.534
And...

04:38.544 --> 04:40.544
It's meant to be funny.

04:51.257 --> 04:53.257
You're so handsome.

04:59.465 --> 05:02.270
I never thought I'd get you here.

05:07.607 --> 05:09.232
You're arriving in the midst of a drama.

05:09.242 --> 05:11.734
Ingrid, would you make sure
Wizard's inside?

05:11.744 --> 05:12.869
It's the Voglers.

05:12.879 --> 05:15.238
The neighbors want us
to cut down our tree.

05:15.248 --> 05:17.244
No. That's our tree.

05:17.254 --> 05:19.542
They think it's sick
and rotting their property.

05:19.552 --> 05:21.110
We're having the ceremony under it.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.712
You took the swing down.

05:22.722 --> 05:27.383
Pauline thinks this is their way
of trying to be friends.

05:27.393 --> 05:30.760
I think they resent us because we're...

05:30.863 --> 05:32.988
I don't know what we are.

05:42.408 --> 05:44.638
-This is my room.
-Okay.

05:45.144 --> 05:48.304
-Do you like showers or baths?
-Showers. What about you?

05:48.314 --> 05:49.472
I don't care.

05:49.482 --> 05:51.541
Is Malcolm what you thought he'd be?

05:51.551 --> 05:54.210
-I didn't know what to...
-The mustache is temporary.

05:54.220 --> 05:56.079
He saved it for last
when he was shaving.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.480
It's meant to be funny.

05:57.490 --> 05:59.490
-He told me.
-Yeah.

05:59.559 --> 06:01.284
I'm sorry, with so little time to prepare,

06:01.294 --> 06:04.387
we had to put you in
Malcolm's storage room.

06:04.397 --> 06:07.491
This was Becky's room. Poor Becky.

06:07.667 --> 06:11.152
Poor Becky.
Well, now it's a storage room.

06:11.237 --> 06:14.564
I've just started to feel like it's our house
and not my parents', you know.

06:14.574 --> 06:15.832
Our parents.

06:15.842 --> 06:17.633
Of course.

06:17.643 --> 06:19.802
Sorry, it might still smell like paint.

06:19.812 --> 06:21.437
I thought he was a musician.

06:21.447 --> 06:24.774
Well, music's officially a hobby.
He's painting now,

06:24.784 --> 06:27.910
and writing letters to newspapers
and magazines.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.145
He's very meticulous.

06:29.155 --> 06:32.515
He'll spend up to a week
writing a response to a music review.

06:32.525 --> 06:38.321
He's incredibly smart. Maybe too smart.
I don't know. We're doing very well.

06:38.331 --> 06:41.164
Good. I mean, you must be.

06:43.202 --> 06:47.282
I don't know where to begin.
What can I tell you?

06:48.341 --> 06:51.234
It seems I'm pregnant,
but it's really early,

06:51.244 --> 06:53.803
so I haven't told anyone.
I mean, I haven't told Malcolm or Ingrid.

06:53.813 --> 06:55.271
-Wow.
-What did you say?

06:55.281 --> 06:56.372
I said wow.

06:56.382 --> 07:00.478
Yeah. If it sticks. We'll see. I hope so.

07:01.053 --> 07:02.311
Things are good.

07:02.321 --> 07:06.082
We did a couples' seminar
two months ago or so in Maine.

07:06.092 --> 07:07.884
They give you exercises
and things to do.

07:07.894 --> 07:11.788
I know you're not convinced,
but we got engaged right afterwards.

07:11.798 --> 07:14.991
The guy who runs it, Strickland,
he wrote this really interesting book,

07:15.001 --> 07:17.059
On Loving,
which I'll lend you if you want.

07:17.069 --> 07:18.127
Okay.

07:18.137 --> 07:19.495
But only if you'll read it.

07:19.505 --> 07:21.731
Because I need it back.
I made notes in the margins.

07:21.741 --> 07:23.533
I may not get to it for a while.

07:23.543 --> 07:27.136
Well, I'm not going to lend it to you
if you're not going to read it.

07:27.146 --> 07:28.805
It's gonna be very informal, by the way.

07:28.815 --> 07:31.441
Just Mom and Becky,
Malcolm's brother,

07:31.451 --> 07:35.044
a few friends, and now you and Claude.
Nothing like the first one.

07:35.054 --> 07:36.412
Becky's coming?

07:36.422 --> 07:38.716
-Yeah.
-Could I have some...

07:38.726 --> 07:39.615
You go.

07:39.625 --> 07:39.782
You go.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.918
I was just going to say
could I have some white wine?

07:41.928 --> 07:43.928
Oh, yeah. We have...

07:46.399 --> 07:50.092
I'm really glad you changed your mind
and came.

07:50.102 --> 07:53.362
I never heard from you after I sent
the invite. I even wondered if you got it.

07:53.372 --> 07:55.164
I'm just so pleased that we're here.

07:55.174 --> 07:56.232
Did you get it?

07:56.242 --> 07:57.900
Yeah.

07:57.910 --> 07:59.368
I'm sorry you were so angry.

07:59.378 --> 08:01.737
I wasn't angry. I was disappointed.

08:01.747 --> 08:03.673
But you see,
when you say disappointed,

08:03.683 --> 08:05.808
it puts me in a crummy situation,
like I let you down.

08:05.818 --> 08:08.211
-Well, you did, in a way.
-No, I don't see it like that.

08:08.221 --> 08:09.879
Fine. I felt betrayed. Is that word okay?

08:09.889 --> 08:11.280
Again, you're making me the aggressor.

08:11.290 --> 08:13.349
You were the aggressor.

08:13.459 --> 08:15.459
Listen, let's not...

08:17.597 --> 08:20.232
I've become a really good cook.

08:24.971 --> 08:28.030
I can't believe you've still got
all of our old records.

08:28.040 --> 08:31.200
-Mom, can you hide this, please?
-Yeah, of course.

08:31.210 --> 08:33.436
Malcolm played with Ric Ocasek once.

08:33.446 --> 08:35.442
Yeah, in the late '80s.

08:35.452 --> 08:38.407
After he left The Cars. It was a solo gig.

08:38.417 --> 08:39.976
So you're kind of famous?

08:39.986 --> 08:44.614
No, no, believe me, I'm not.
I used to want to be, but no.

08:44.624 --> 08:45.715
Do you want to be famous?

08:45.725 --> 08:47.850
Claude wants to be very famous.

08:47.860 --> 08:51.954
Well, make sure you can
handle rejection. I can't.

08:51.964 --> 08:54.757
For me, expectation just
turns to disappointment.

08:54.767 --> 08:57.093
So ultimately, I'd rather not try.

08:57.103 --> 08:58.661
Claude, ignore him.

08:58.671 --> 09:01.797
It'll all go black for us
soon enough, anyway.

09:01.807 --> 09:03.566
When your mother moved to New York,

09:03.576 --> 09:05.601
she used to send me
books and records.

09:05.611 --> 09:07.803
-She sent me R.E.M.'s Murmur.
-And the Pixies.

09:07.813 --> 09:11.681
And X. She was very cool, your mother.

09:12.385 --> 09:17.400
-You only liked Top 40.
-That's true. But I love R.E.M. now.

09:17.757 --> 09:20.116
I don't really listen to music anymore.

09:20.126 --> 09:24.120
I was dating that guy Horace back then.
Do you remember him?

09:24.130 --> 09:26.088
Was that the guy
that liked to rough you up?

09:26.098 --> 09:27.990
No, that was our dad.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.360
Our dad used to strip down to
his skivvies and beat us with a belt.

09:31.370 --> 09:33.296
That man had a sexual screw loose.

09:33.306 --> 09:35.531
That's awful that stuff
that happens to kids.

09:35.541 --> 09:37.900
Malcolm was fondled
by a male babysitter.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.102
Just use that information
however you want.

09:40.112 --> 09:43.682
I'm sorry, we're with family. I figured...

09:44.917 --> 09:46.876
I think Becky got it the worst.

09:46.886 --> 09:50.286
Did she ever.
Raped by the horse trainer.

10:02.535 --> 10:06.329
Alan rolled over in bed and he looked
at me and he said, "I can't feel my face."

10:06.339 --> 10:09.098
It took three doctors before
we knew it was Bell's Palsy.

10:09.108 --> 10:11.701
They say a brush of wind can do it.

10:11.711 --> 10:13.536
Feeling is slowly coming back.

10:13.546 --> 10:16.572
We're all getting older, which is terrible.

10:16.582 --> 10:20.643
I don't care how universal it is.
I can't remember names anymore.

10:20.653 --> 10:24.580
I have that.
I blank out on certain words now, too.

10:24.590 --> 10:28.670
The other day I couldn't remember
the word for...

10:28.928 --> 10:33.356
I've forgotten it again. The stuff in wine.
What is it? Sediment. That's it.

10:33.366 --> 10:34.657
I know that. I was talking more about

10:34.667 --> 10:37.360
not remembering who was
the bassist for Mötley Crüe.

10:37.370 --> 10:40.429
Ingrid. Why don't you show Claude
and Bruce the game trunk?

10:40.439 --> 10:41.497
Okay.

10:41.507 --> 10:43.507
Mick Mars.

10:51.183 --> 10:55.093
Toby, I think you need to have
Bruce diagnosed.

10:55.221 --> 10:57.947
Margot, I don't wanna have
this conversation with you.

10:57.957 --> 11:01.050
It's vital. If you keep telling him
he's like everyone else,

11:01.060 --> 11:03.986
he's gonna wonder why he isn't.
He's suffering.

11:03.996 --> 11:07.123
He's tested very well.
He does B's in school.

11:07.133 --> 11:08.791
But that's how autism works.

11:08.801 --> 11:11.727
One part of the brain can be fine,
and then the other part is damaged.

11:11.737 --> 11:14.964
We've had him diagnosed, Margot.
Nothing was found wrong.

11:14.974 --> 11:16.974
Did you really, though?

11:17.243 --> 11:21.238
I'm not gonna have this conversation.
I'm sorry.

11:22.515 --> 11:27.530
I know this must be so difficult for you,
but you have to...

11:28.254 --> 11:29.378
What are you doing?

11:29.388 --> 11:31.080
I left you a note.

11:31.090 --> 11:33.090
Come back.

11:33.626 --> 11:36.252
Or meet me in Vermont on Saturday.

11:36.262 --> 11:39.925
No. No. The wedding is on Saturday.

11:40.032 --> 11:44.627
I'm here for that. I can't pull out.
How would that look?

11:44.637 --> 11:46.662
You haven't spoken to her in years.

11:46.672 --> 11:51.467
Well, we're speaking now.
She is my closest friend, despite it all.

11:51.477 --> 11:53.669
You were the one that kept trying
to get me to call her.

11:53.679 --> 11:56.405
Did you tell Claude what you're doing?

11:56.415 --> 11:59.441
Jim, this guy, Malcolm,

12:02.421 --> 12:07.516
he's exactly what you'd imagine,
except I think he's clinically depressed.

12:07.526 --> 12:11.606
He's not ugly.
He's just completely unattractive.

12:11.997 --> 12:13.656
He has no job.

12:13.666 --> 12:17.393
Best I can make out is
he's a letter writer. I don't know.

12:17.403 --> 12:21.993
And the house looks weird to me.
She's trying too hard.

12:22.007 --> 12:24.047
It's all kind of a mess.

12:26.078 --> 12:28.569
They took down the swing.

12:29.548 --> 12:30.639
Hello?

12:30.649 --> 12:34.510
You said you weren't 100% on this.
You said that like a week ago.

12:34.520 --> 12:35.578
Can I come up there?

12:35.588 --> 12:39.882
No. I don't want to see you.
I feel happier already having done it.

12:39.892 --> 12:43.419
Please, don't tell Claude anything,
please, until we've talked more.

12:43.429 --> 12:48.157
This is happening, and you need
to get your mind around that.

12:48.167 --> 12:51.227
-Are you asleep?
-Yes.

12:53.672 --> 12:56.300
-Will you remember this?
-Yeah.

12:59.044 --> 13:01.254
I just talked to your dad.

13:02.948 --> 13:07.028
I'm only going to tell you
if you won't remember.

13:07.153 --> 13:09.153
Okay.

13:12.825 --> 13:16.018
Everyone finds you so funny
and charming.

13:16.028 --> 13:19.003
I always get compliments about you.

13:19.965 --> 13:23.526
Are you having fun?
Is it nice to see Pauline?

13:23.536 --> 13:27.696
-Yeah, I really like her.
-Yeah, she is crazy, though.

13:27.706 --> 13:30.903
-In what way?
-She's really berserk.

13:31.443 --> 13:33.483
Maybe it's the hormones.

13:34.180 --> 13:37.306
You didn't notice anything
different about Pauline?

13:37.316 --> 13:40.342
-No.
-She's pregnant. She told me.

13:40.452 --> 13:44.880
She's keeping it a secret
from Malcolm and even Ingrid,

13:44.890 --> 13:47.440
which I think is unforgivable.

13:48.527 --> 13:51.287
Now she's gonna have to marry him.

13:51.297 --> 13:52.855
What's she planning on doing,
getting married

13:52.865 --> 13:57.126
and not drinking champagne?
Then she's just gonna be lying.

13:57.136 --> 14:00.496
I guess she's afraid she'll miscarry.
She probably will.

14:00.506 --> 14:02.631
I think on some level,
she's ambivalent about the marriage.

14:02.641 --> 14:05.446
That's why she's not telling him.

14:06.345 --> 14:08.345
Are you stoned, Mom?

14:09.715 --> 14:11.715
Maybe a little.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.518
I don't like it.

14:17.890 --> 14:20.865
My scrotum is longer than my penis.

14:24.663 --> 14:27.808
It's sweet how Claude looks up to me.

14:29.501 --> 14:32.595
Margot doesn't seem as crazy
as you made her out to be.

14:32.605 --> 14:36.665
What she did to Alan and Toby tonight
didn't seem crazy enough for you?

14:36.675 --> 14:38.701
I guess that seemed pretty crazy.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.336
Well, she cares deeply.

14:40.346 --> 14:43.105
Yeah, she's really worried about Bruce.

14:43.115 --> 14:48.725
This has nothing to do with Bruce.
She thinks everyone is autistic.

14:49.855 --> 14:50.946
What?

14:50.956 --> 14:52.581
Nothing.
You keep changing your position.

14:52.591 --> 14:54.817
I'm just trying to figure out
if I should agree with you or not.

14:54.827 --> 14:57.419
Well, can't she be both?
Care deeply and be crazy?

14:57.429 --> 14:59.755
I mean, do people have to be
all one thing?

14:59.765 --> 15:02.315
-I guess not.
-Well, okay then.

15:03.402 --> 15:06.061
It is nice she came for the wedding.

15:06.071 --> 15:08.876
She's so pretty, don't you think?

15:09.174 --> 15:12.574
-She's attractive.
-A little thin, maybe.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.786
But it is nice she came.

15:16.882 --> 15:18.882
Let's fuck.

15:50.015 --> 15:52.015
Fuck it!

15:52.251 --> 15:53.342
Claude!

15:53.352 --> 15:56.242
I knew I could be friends with him

15:56.455 --> 15:58.047
Good go.

15:58.057 --> 16:00.057
Honey, you're up.

16:08.767 --> 16:13.062
Claude, don't just whack it.
Think about it before you hit.

16:13.072 --> 16:15.072
Sorry.

16:15.941 --> 16:17.941
Good.

16:18.077 --> 16:19.134
Paul, what are you doing?

16:19.144 --> 16:20.436
I'm sending Claude's ball
into the bushes.

16:20.446 --> 16:21.503
Take the extra hit.

16:21.513 --> 16:24.273
-I don't want to do that.
-It's the smarter play.

16:24.283 --> 16:28.310
Pauline! I told you, you can't!
Your feet are too small.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.530
You took the awnings down.

16:39.965 --> 16:41.965
Yes!

16:42.401 --> 16:44.401
Okay.

16:57.616 --> 16:59.743
-Well done.
-Fuck you.

17:03.922 --> 17:05.922
Come on, Claude.

17:15.300 --> 17:18.190
Honey, you're going the wrong way.

17:18.604 --> 17:20.095
So stupid.

17:20.105 --> 17:22.403
Mom, I'm sorry. Jesus.

17:24.742 --> 17:29.078
This is why I hate games.
I hate what it does to me.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.847
Wait! We're not finished yet!

17:34.053 --> 17:36.053
Malcolm?

17:37.489 --> 17:43.099
Have you ever noticed how Pauline
sometimes can't make eye contact?

17:43.295 --> 17:46.695
How her gaze hovers
just above your head?

17:46.732 --> 17:48.590
I think I know what you mean.

17:48.600 --> 17:52.094
I always think
that I have something in my hair.

17:52.104 --> 17:57.459
It's not necessarily bad, Paul.
It's just something that you do.

17:58.877 --> 18:02.704
Claude, have you ever seen
your mother climb a tree?

18:02.714 --> 18:03.806
No.

18:03.816 --> 18:06.341
We don't have much opportunity
in Manhattan.

18:06.351 --> 18:09.144
As kids, Margot climbed everything.

18:09.154 --> 18:10.746
She could even climb that tree.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.756
Can you do it, Mom?

18:13.959 --> 18:15.959
-Maybe later.
-No, now.

18:15.994 --> 18:19.139
-Do it now, Margot.
-Show him, Margot.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.127
I told you.

20:17.716 --> 20:19.716
Shit.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.885
What's she doing now?

20:22.754 --> 20:24.754
She's stuck.

20:34.499 --> 20:36.091
You okay?

20:36.101 --> 20:38.101
I got it.

20:46.478 --> 20:48.670
You were great on the way up.

20:48.680 --> 20:52.808
-Don't patronize me, Claude.
-Come on, we're all laughing, Margot!

20:52.818 --> 20:54.276
You're laughing in a kind way.

20:54.286 --> 20:56.111
Claude is taking
too much pleasure out of it.

20:56.121 --> 20:57.846
-I am not.
-You are.

20:57.856 --> 21:01.383
You like to make fun of me,
to see me get embarrassed.

21:01.393 --> 21:03.393
It's mean.

21:05.998 --> 21:10.359
-What are you doing?
-I've got a fucking bug in my ear, okay?

21:10.369 --> 21:14.463
I thought Claude could hand out
programs. Ingrid wants to sing.

21:14.473 --> 21:16.298
Do you want to read a poem
or something?

21:16.308 --> 21:19.868
You know I don't like
to speak in front of people.

21:19.878 --> 21:23.071
I'm doing this conversation
at the bookstore in town on Friday.

21:23.081 --> 21:25.807
I totally regret having said I'd do it.

21:25.817 --> 21:28.197
You're doing a conversation?

21:28.220 --> 21:31.313
Yeah. Just talking about my work
in front of a crowd.

21:31.323 --> 21:35.913
I would have invited you,
but I thought it'd be boring.

21:36.995 --> 21:38.654
What? Say it.

21:38.664 --> 21:41.189
Nothing. It's just, I would come.
I wanna come.

21:41.199 --> 21:42.524
I get a kick out of it.

21:42.534 --> 21:47.209
Just, it's weird, you know.
So you're not here for my...

21:49.074 --> 21:52.644
It's okay. I get it.
When did they ask you?

21:53.111 --> 21:57.039
A while ago. I said no, but then
when I was coming here anyway,

21:57.049 --> 21:59.854
I guess it helps sales. And so...

22:01.687 --> 22:03.687
I see.

22:04.489 --> 22:07.889
Did I tell you Becky got her tubes tied?

22:08.427 --> 22:12.154
Why? Is she seeing someone?
She's still obese, I assume.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.689
I think it's symbolic.

22:13.699 --> 22:15.524
I bet Mom paid for it.

22:15.534 --> 22:18.360
-We should audit Mom.
-I considered it in my 20s.

22:18.370 --> 22:21.196
You know, when I was fucking everyone.
You remember?

22:21.206 --> 22:24.369
-I did my share.
-Not like me.

22:25.077 --> 22:27.077
You wanna count?

22:27.479 --> 22:30.199
No, Margot. I don't wanna count.

22:30.515 --> 22:35.105
What was it about Dad
that had us fucking so many guys?

22:35.153 --> 22:37.813
I think it was the only time
we could really feel unselfconscious

22:37.823 --> 22:39.948
and get out of our heads.

22:39.958 --> 22:41.283
I don't think it was that.

22:41.293 --> 22:43.318
I just think it was something
we were good at.

22:43.328 --> 22:45.320
Your mom thinks Bruce is gay.

22:45.330 --> 22:49.891
No, she said he had Asperger's.
It's like lesser-retarded.

22:49.901 --> 22:53.701
-I have adult A.D.D.
-You mean child A.D.D.

22:53.839 --> 22:56.498
No. For some reason
I have the adult version.

22:56.508 --> 22:57.833
Maybe I'm retarded.

22:57.843 --> 22:59.601
-Come on!
-Come on!

22:59.611 --> 23:02.239
-Hey! Be careful!
-What?

23:02.347 --> 23:04.306
Be careful how you pull on
that child's arm.

23:04.316 --> 23:05.707
You'll take it out of its socket.

23:05.717 --> 23:07.843
Don't tell us how to treat our child.

23:07.853 --> 23:10.579
I don't care how you treat your child.
Just don't hurt him.

23:10.589 --> 23:13.115
-It's a girl.
-She threw a rock at me.

23:13.125 --> 23:14.282
She's a little girl.

23:14.292 --> 23:17.919
She knew what she was doing.
There's no hitting in our family.

23:17.929 --> 23:19.888
Do you understand?

23:19.898 --> 23:21.898
Stay out of it, bitch.

23:22.167 --> 23:23.992
That was the Voglers.

23:24.002 --> 23:25.894
Jesus, Margot, what are you doing?
They already hate us.

23:25.904 --> 23:28.964
Don't you tell me what I can
and can't do. That is child abuse.

23:28.974 --> 23:30.532
Mom, she was psychotic.

23:30.542 --> 23:33.007
Stop picking on me, everyone.

23:39.151 --> 23:41.151
Oh, God.

23:47.659 --> 23:49.659
It could be anyone's.

23:51.396 --> 23:52.954
What are they gonna do to us?

23:52.964 --> 23:55.524
They're not going to do anything, honey.

23:55.534 --> 23:57.192
We have to cut down the tree.

23:57.202 --> 23:58.593
You should have seen
that woman's face.

23:58.603 --> 24:00.061
Margot completely set her off.

24:00.071 --> 24:02.330
Where are we gonna get married then?

24:02.340 --> 24:04.499
We'll get married
in the fucking driveway if we have to.

24:04.509 --> 24:06.509
Your mom started a war.

24:06.812 --> 24:08.303
We have to make sure we wear shoes,

24:08.313 --> 24:11.006
because they might
start throwing glass.

24:11.016 --> 24:15.776
-Has that happened before?
-I can't remember. I think so.

24:15.921 --> 24:19.151
No, it definitely has. Now I remember.

24:21.426 --> 24:24.553
-Where you going?
-To town. I'll be back for dinner.

24:24.563 --> 24:27.538
Come on, Margot, nobody blames you.

24:33.472 --> 24:37.892
-Is that Dick Koosman?
-Yeah. He has a house up here.

24:38.477 --> 24:41.962
-What's he doing with Mom?
-Good question.

24:46.918 --> 24:50.345
Dick and his daughter asked us over
to swim tomorrow.

24:50.355 --> 24:52.614
We didn't invite them to the wedding.

24:52.624 --> 24:53.949
You're not really friends.

24:53.959 --> 24:58.186
We're friends enough that it's awkward.
Maisy baby-sits for us all the time.

24:58.196 --> 25:00.622
He's doing the interview with me
in town on Friday.

25:00.632 --> 25:03.592
Did I tell you he and I are collaborating
on a screenplay?

25:03.602 --> 25:05.527
An adaptation of one of Dick's novels.

25:05.537 --> 25:07.929
No, I didn't even know you knew
he was up here.

25:07.939 --> 25:10.899
Is he even a good writer?
Why do people care about him?

25:10.909 --> 25:12.167
You're competitive with everyone.

25:12.177 --> 25:14.569
It doesn't even matter
if they do the same thing as you.

25:14.579 --> 25:16.404
He's competitive with Bono.

25:16.414 --> 25:18.373
It's true. I don't subscribe to the credo

25:18.383 --> 25:20.909
that there's enough room
for everyone to be successful.

25:20.919 --> 25:22.544
I think there are only
a few spots available,

25:22.554 --> 25:25.614
and people like Dick Koosman
and Bono are taking them up.

25:25.624 --> 25:27.716
Malcolm, what would ever make
you think that's something

25:27.726 --> 25:29.726
to draw right now?

25:29.995 --> 25:31.995
Sorry.

25:33.164 --> 25:36.291
I wasn't thinking about it. Sorry, Margot.

25:36.301 --> 25:37.559
You found it.

25:37.569 --> 25:39.569
-Hi!
-Hey, Maisy.

25:42.307 --> 25:44.307
Thank you, Pauline.

25:45.110 --> 25:47.110
-Hi.
-How are you?

25:47.979 --> 25:49.771
-What's up?
-I don't wanna do this.

25:49.781 --> 25:52.040
-Come on, don't be that way.
-No, I'm not being that way.

25:52.050 --> 25:54.260
I just don't feel like it.

25:54.819 --> 25:58.179
I'm gonna go back and...
I have work to do.

25:58.189 --> 25:59.848
Dick doesn't care
that you don't make any money.

25:59.858 --> 26:02.517
Is that what you... That's not why.

26:02.527 --> 26:05.987
I just hate swimming. I really hate it.
It's disgusting to me.

26:05.997 --> 26:08.156
My mistake was saying
I would do it to begin with.

26:08.166 --> 26:09.824
You have fun.

26:09.834 --> 26:11.834
Fine. We'll have fun.

26:16.374 --> 26:17.899
People always pee in the pool.

26:17.909 --> 26:19.868
I don't think Dick and Maisy pee
in their pool.

26:19.878 --> 26:22.470
I'll bet you $500 there's pee in that pool.

26:22.480 --> 26:24.573
To the end and back.
Claude, you say go.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.583
Okay. Go!

26:29.688 --> 26:31.479
-How's your dad?
-Good.

26:31.489 --> 26:34.416
He and I shared a thesis advisor
at Stanford. Did you know that?

26:34.426 --> 26:36.151
No.

26:36.161 --> 26:38.219
I was dating your mom back then.
Did you know that?

26:38.229 --> 26:40.229
No.

26:47.606 --> 26:51.542
-Pauline wins! Mom cheated.
-I did not.

26:51.643 --> 26:53.535
You didn't touch the wall, Margot.

26:53.545 --> 26:56.708
It doesn't matter. Lost anyway.

26:56.815 --> 26:58.815
It was close.

27:01.519 --> 27:04.324
Maisy, aren't you going swimming?

27:46.564 --> 27:48.564
Claude!

27:51.503 --> 27:53.503
Are you okay?

27:53.705 --> 27:55.705
I got him!

28:00.712 --> 28:02.712
It's okay, baby.

28:12.357 --> 28:16.777
-I'm sorry I laughed about the tree.
-Now we're even.

28:20.632 --> 28:23.625
-You've got a problem.
-What do you mean?

28:23.635 --> 28:24.826
I don't like the girl,

28:24.836 --> 28:26.961
and I don't like the way
Malcolm looks at her.

28:26.971 --> 28:28.196
Come on, it's sexy.

28:28.206 --> 28:30.732
No, you didn't see it.
I saw it. You've got a problem.

28:30.742 --> 28:32.742
I'm not worried.

28:33.712 --> 28:36.347
Maybe teach Claude how to swim.

28:36.381 --> 28:39.611
He won't want to do it. It's too late.

28:40.685 --> 28:44.000
-Are you supposed to be doing that?
-No.

28:45.423 --> 28:48.950
I liked your last story. Was it Harper's?
The one about Mom.

28:48.960 --> 28:51.935
I was very... I liked it very much.

28:52.597 --> 28:56.507
-It wasn't really about Mom.
-I thought it was.

28:56.634 --> 28:59.527
Anyway. Why don't you want
Claude to know how to swim?

28:59.537 --> 29:02.864
I didn't say I didn't want him to.
Why do you care?

29:02.874 --> 29:04.332
It's not in his life. We're New Yorkers.

29:04.342 --> 29:07.001
If he wants to learn when he's older,
he can.

29:07.011 --> 29:09.137
I'm curious why you're so
interested in the whole thing.

29:09.147 --> 29:13.550
I'm not. It's just as a safety thing.
Forget it.

29:15.186 --> 29:16.845
It's interesting.

29:16.855 --> 29:19.781
This is the first time
Dick has invited us over.

29:19.791 --> 29:21.182
Are you really friends?

29:21.192 --> 29:23.418
Well, we're neighbors.
We employ Maisy.

29:23.428 --> 29:26.788
I mean, I don't care.
I just think it's interesting.

29:26.798 --> 29:32.068
Are you excited about the talk?
I'd like to come, if it's okay.

29:32.137 --> 29:35.630
My friend Blair asked me, "What's it like
to have a celebrity as a sister?"

29:35.640 --> 29:37.699
I said I've got no problem with celebrity.

29:37.709 --> 29:41.102
Alice Munro spoke at Bennington
and was sort of a friend of mine.

29:41.112 --> 29:43.538
-I'm not a celebrity.
-Well, you're well-known.

29:43.548 --> 29:47.742
-To a very few people.
-Just accept the compliment.

29:47.752 --> 29:51.492
I guess I didn't realize
it was a compliment.

31:17.642 --> 31:21.976
I know a girl from a lonely street

31:22.080 --> 31:25.243
Cold as ice cream, but still as sweet

31:25.350 --> 31:28.717
Dry your eyes, Sunday girl

31:28.820 --> 31:32.847
Hey, I saw your guy with a different girl

31:32.957 --> 31:35.687
Looks like he's in another world

31:36.060 --> 31:38.858
Go on and hide, Sunday girl

31:39.597 --> 31:40.922
She can't catch up

31:40.932 --> 31:42.932
Singing?

31:45.270 --> 31:47.270
A bit.

31:47.705 --> 31:49.745
Can I make a suggestion?

31:51.175 --> 31:55.595
You should get underarm deodorant.
You kind of smell.

31:56.581 --> 31:59.641
Better I tell you than someone else.

32:02.553 --> 32:06.718
-I think you smell nice. You smell real.
-I stink.

32:07.959 --> 32:11.292
-It causes cancer.
-Underarm deodorant?

32:11.896 --> 32:16.691
It's got chemicals and other things
which are extremely harmful.

32:16.701 --> 32:19.093
I'm not gonna die
from underarm cancer.

32:19.103 --> 32:23.464
No, you'll get it somewhere else,
like your stomach or your testicles.

32:23.474 --> 32:27.384
-Testicles?
-Don't laugh. It's a serious thing.

32:28.079 --> 32:30.714
Who told you about this anyway?

32:31.783 --> 32:34.274
-Maisy?
-Yeah.

32:35.987 --> 32:39.547
I hope you're not interested in that girl.
I find her insufferable.

32:39.557 --> 32:40.782
What does that mean?

32:40.792 --> 32:43.818
It means I can't suffer her.
She's loud and stupid.

32:43.828 --> 32:46.888
And she goes on about things
of which she knows nothing about.

32:46.898 --> 32:48.623
She got into Harvard early.

32:48.633 --> 32:52.427
Stupid people get into Harvard early
all the time.

32:52.437 --> 32:55.338
-Where did you go again?
-Barnard.

32:58.843 --> 33:01.035
I just don't think
you should do anything with her.

33:01.045 --> 33:03.045
We're just friends.

33:03.414 --> 33:06.474
If you do, use a condom.

33:06.584 --> 33:07.809
Where are you going?

33:07.819 --> 33:11.049
Out with Pauline and Malcolm and Dick.

33:13.324 --> 33:15.324
Are kids coming?

33:19.897 --> 33:21.222
Who do we know is gay?

33:21.232 --> 33:23.324
How do I know
what gay people you know?

33:23.334 --> 33:27.562
-Alan and Toby.
-And Bruce. He's gay and Asperger's.

33:27.572 --> 33:32.567
-I don't know if Bruce is gay.
-He might be. It's very common.

33:32.577 --> 33:35.637
-Your mom's pregnant.
-No, she isn't.

33:35.847 --> 33:37.805
-She is.
-How do you know that, Claude?

33:37.815 --> 33:41.075
She told my mom. But you can tell.
She's hormonally weird.

33:41.085 --> 33:42.610
Holy shit, Ingrid.

33:42.620 --> 33:46.190
You're gonna have
a baby sister or brother.

33:46.858 --> 33:50.003
My mom thinks your mom is unreliable.

33:50.528 --> 33:51.753
Who cares?

33:51.763 --> 33:54.055
-Do you think your mom is fuckable?
-I don't know.

33:54.065 --> 33:57.892
I think she's hot, your mother.
I'd do her if I was gay.

33:57.902 --> 34:00.094
I might anyway,
I mean, if she came on to me.

34:00.104 --> 34:02.063
She won't.

34:02.073 --> 34:04.113
I'm not gonna do anyone.

34:05.309 --> 34:07.859
-What was that?
-This is scary.

34:40.478 --> 34:42.536
Margot used to never speak.

34:42.547 --> 34:45.206
I remember we went on a double date
in high school.

34:45.216 --> 34:47.775
And that kid Ron asked
if English was your first language.

34:47.784 --> 34:51.344
It's true. I used to think
I had some kind of brain defect.

34:51.355 --> 34:54.282
-You thought you were aphasic.
-I'm still not sure.

34:54.292 --> 34:56.884
-Jesus, Margot.
-It's very possible, Paul.

34:56.893 --> 34:59.954
It's just, your diagnoses sometimes irk
the hell out of me.

34:59.964 --> 35:02.924
-Malcolm, will you slow down?
-What?

35:02.934 --> 35:04.592
I can drive, if you like.

35:04.602 --> 35:07.462
Nah. You got the dinner.
The driving's on me.

35:07.472 --> 35:10.331
Well, I'll let you pay your half
if you slow down.

35:10.341 --> 35:13.201
Well, neither Pauline nor I
ordered dessert.

35:13.211 --> 35:15.136
Let it go, Malcolm.

35:15.146 --> 35:17.905
Margot would insist on driving,
if she knew how.

35:17.915 --> 35:20.074
My license elapsed, but I know how.

35:20.084 --> 35:24.579
It's probably for the best.
I have this theory. I think, historically,

35:24.589 --> 35:27.381
women have been held back in so many
ways that when they get power

35:27.391 --> 35:31.319
like they do behind the wheel,
they can't help but abuse it.

35:31.329 --> 35:33.588
It's akin to Hannah Arendt's
Eichmann theory about

35:33.598 --> 35:35.990
prison guards and prisoners
switching roles.

35:36.000 --> 35:39.727
-That's a charming philosophy.
-Yeah, tell that one a lot.

35:39.737 --> 35:42.530
This isn't a blanket thing.
I mean, women can be great drivers too.

35:42.540 --> 35:46.400
Said the man with the mustache
he thinks he's wearing in quotes.

35:46.410 --> 35:48.410
It's meant to be funny.

35:49.480 --> 35:52.440
Are you doing this for her benefit
or for mine?

35:52.450 --> 35:54.577
-What the fuck?
-What?

35:54.685 --> 35:59.347
No, there they go. It's okay. I thought
I lost the brakes for a second there.

35:59.357 --> 36:00.648
-Malcolm!
-What?

36:00.658 --> 36:03.218
-Watch it!
-It's fine, Margot!

36:03.561 --> 36:05.052
You're just so incompetent.

36:05.062 --> 36:09.227
Okay. Why don't you fucking
drive yourselves home?

36:13.304 --> 36:15.304
God.

36:16.541 --> 36:18.581
You should go after her.

36:28.819 --> 36:31.029
Come home with me tonight.

36:32.423 --> 36:35.984
-I've got Claude.
-Come on.

36:36.360 --> 36:40.100
I've been trying to get you
up here all year.

36:40.731 --> 36:42.731
She's pregnant.

37:00.885 --> 37:04.745
-Why are you putting that there?
-I just wanna keep it.

37:04.755 --> 37:07.415
I left a piece of skin
in a movie theater once.

37:07.425 --> 37:10.655
So it could watch movies all its life.

37:10.995 --> 37:14.055
-Are you obsessed with Maisy?
-No.

37:14.165 --> 37:17.055
You're always staring at her tits.

37:21.138 --> 37:24.623
-You have a mustache.
-My mom bleaches it.

37:29.080 --> 37:33.330
-Where are you going?
-You're starting to annoy me.

38:05.416 --> 38:07.416
What are you doing?

38:08.552 --> 38:12.632
-I didn't think you came home.
-Where would I be?

38:13.491 --> 38:16.017
Can't Josh and Dad come
to the wedding?

38:16.027 --> 38:18.917
I've been through this. Go to bed.

38:19.263 --> 38:21.263
Can I sleep in here?

38:21.332 --> 38:23.328
No, honey.

38:23.338 --> 38:25.969
We can put a pillow between us.

38:26.837 --> 38:30.204
Okay. Just for tonight.

38:57.268 --> 39:01.529
When you were a baby,
I wouldn't let anyone else hold you.

39:01.539 --> 39:04.684
I think that may have been a mistake.

39:04.775 --> 39:06.300
Why was it a secret?

39:06.310 --> 39:09.537
Because I didn't want you to get excited
before it was real.

39:09.547 --> 39:11.806
It's not really a baby yet.

39:11.816 --> 39:14.642
In two weeks
we can celebrate together, okay?

39:14.652 --> 39:16.692
Why did you tell Margot?

39:17.221 --> 39:20.621
Because she's my sister and I trust her.

39:20.691 --> 39:22.816
How do you feel about it?

39:23.027 --> 39:25.027
I don't want a sister.

39:26.197 --> 39:28.197
I'm gonna get Wizard.

39:32.837 --> 39:35.796
Margot told Claude something
I expressly told her in confidence.

39:35.806 --> 39:37.398
And he told Ingrid.

39:37.408 --> 39:40.468
I'm stunned that she put me in this
position. It's so fucking infuriating!

39:40.478 --> 39:43.137
-Well, it's one of those things...
-Don't say anything, okay?

39:43.147 --> 39:46.273
You know what?
Just be there for me silently.

39:46.283 --> 39:47.508
Okay.

39:47.518 --> 39:49.443
Why do I have to be
so careful around her,

39:49.453 --> 39:51.779
but everyone is allowed
to make fun of me?

39:51.789 --> 39:55.182
-I don't think...
-Malcolm, what did I just say?

39:55.192 --> 40:00.887
I just need you to take my side.
I don't need you to make it better.

40:02.133 --> 40:04.133
Ingrid's really upset.

40:04.602 --> 40:08.767
Fuck! I can't believe
she put me in this position.

40:09.507 --> 40:11.732
I didn't tell you before because

40:11.742 --> 40:14.668
I didn't want you to feel like
you had to marry me.

40:14.678 --> 40:19.268
I found out right before our seminar
that I'm pregnant.

40:21.252 --> 40:24.417
Well? Does that sound good to you?

40:24.427 --> 40:24.678
Well? Does that sound good to you?

40:24.688 --> 40:30.213
I'm still digesting Margot telling Claude.
What a fucking nut job.

40:30.327 --> 40:33.125
Sorry. I think I'm really happy.

40:43.574 --> 40:45.701
Ingrid! Come here, honey.

41:31.255 --> 41:33.917
-Hey.
-Hey.

41:34.358 --> 41:37.418
I'm just looking at Pauline's
incense and self-help books.

41:37.428 --> 41:38.819
I don't understand it.

41:38.829 --> 41:42.690
This junk makes her look stupid,
and she's not.

41:42.700 --> 41:45.259
I don't like to think of her this way.

41:45.269 --> 41:47.499
She is such a hypocrite.

41:47.605 --> 41:49.296
Somehow, I'm a kook
for going to therapy,

41:49.306 --> 41:53.868
yet she's got enough drugs here
to medicate an elephant.

41:53.878 --> 41:56.670
-She's always with these losers.
-Malcolm's not a loser.

41:56.680 --> 41:59.440
-Claude, think about it.
-He's cool.

41:59.450 --> 42:01.542
What makes you think he's cool?

42:01.552 --> 42:05.279
I'm more talking about her investment
in things like cults and ashrams.

42:05.289 --> 42:08.087
-She was in a cult?
-Years ago.

42:09.293 --> 42:14.221
She and Lenny also followed some guru
who was a follower of the Muktananda.

42:14.231 --> 42:17.036
He made her drink his bath water.

42:17.301 --> 42:19.693
Who knows what she's doing now.

42:19.703 --> 42:21.462
Margot? Claude?

42:21.472 --> 42:23.565
-Wizard!
-Wizard!

42:23.674 --> 42:24.732
Wizard!

42:24.742 --> 42:27.201
-How long has he been gone?
-I don't know.

42:27.211 --> 42:29.937
Ingrid brought him in last night,
but we couldn't find him this morning.

42:29.947 --> 42:31.472
-Oh, boy.
-Wizard!

42:31.482 --> 42:34.287
Did you tell Claude I'm pregnant?

42:34.451 --> 42:36.715
-I don't know.
-You did.

42:37.087 --> 42:39.313
-Well, I guess I said something.
-You did.

42:39.323 --> 42:40.948
You don't have to tell him everything.

42:40.958 --> 42:43.918
He wants to know.
If I don't tell him, he figures it out.

42:43.928 --> 42:45.352
Mom, where's Wizard?

42:45.362 --> 42:47.154
I don't know, honey.

42:47.164 --> 42:49.123
You didn't let him out
into the road or something

42:49.133 --> 42:50.691
where something could have
happened to him?

42:50.701 --> 42:54.361
Why would you think that's
something I would do? That's awful.

42:54.371 --> 43:00.406
I didn't mean on purpose. I just meant
maybe in case you knew something.

43:02.112 --> 43:05.878
-Sorry. I'm here.
-I didn't see you.

43:05.983 --> 43:07.341
I'm just writing my vows.

43:07.351 --> 43:10.244
Trying to do something appropriate,
but also funny.

43:10.254 --> 43:13.484
Not jokey, more character-based humor.

43:14.224 --> 43:16.264
You having an okay time?

43:16.327 --> 43:19.132
Yeah, besides Wizard getting out.

43:19.163 --> 43:21.631
Yeah. We'll find him.

43:22.566 --> 43:23.857
Or else, I don't know.

43:23.867 --> 43:25.092
-We won't.
-Right.

43:25.102 --> 43:27.822
Or else, he's dead or something.

43:28.105 --> 43:31.845
-It means a lot to Paul that you came.
-Yeah.

43:37.381 --> 43:40.975
That is the same toaster
we had here as kids.

43:40.985 --> 43:42.985
Paul is so weird.

43:43.821 --> 43:46.213
I hear you've heard the news.

43:46.223 --> 43:48.987
Yeah. Congratulations.

43:49.093 --> 43:54.533
Pretty cool. Hard to fully take in.
It's still a little abstract.

43:54.698 --> 43:56.290
I haven't had that thing yet
where you realize

43:56.300 --> 44:00.890
that you're not the most important
person in the world.

44:01.739 --> 44:04.374
I'm anxious for that to happen.

44:04.842 --> 44:10.237
I guess I have to thank you.
I wouldn't know yet if you hadn't arrived.

44:10.247 --> 44:11.572
You're welcome.

44:11.582 --> 44:15.909
Of course I can't help but worry I'll pass
not-so-great genes on to the kid.

44:15.919 --> 44:18.278
I mean, in my family
there's a lot of hand washing, but...

44:18.288 --> 44:21.415
I don't have it, but my brother does.

44:21.425 --> 44:24.518
-Are you working on anything now?
-Besides the thing with Dick?

44:24.528 --> 44:26.453
Oh, right. Yeah.

44:26.463 --> 44:27.621
How about you?

44:27.631 --> 44:33.394
-I'm working on some abstract...
-No one fills the ice cube trays here.

44:33.404 --> 44:35.729
-Sorry, what were you saying?
-No. It's okay.

44:35.739 --> 44:39.233
-No, what were you saying?
-It really... Nothing.

44:39.243 --> 44:41.769
-Okay.
-I was saying I'm working on some

44:41.779 --> 44:44.772
abstractions in acrylic paint,
but it's not...

44:44.782 --> 44:46.674
I'm not getting paid or anything.

44:46.684 --> 44:49.610
I don't know.
I hate that question, "What do you do?"

44:49.620 --> 44:52.350
-You asked me.
-I know, but...

44:56.093 --> 44:57.985
I think we shouldn't mention the tree.

44:57.995 --> 45:00.254
We should let them know there'll be
people and music on Saturday,

45:00.264 --> 45:01.622
and it'll be louder than usual.

45:01.632 --> 45:03.424
Yeah, and they can come over
for a glass of champagne,

45:03.434 --> 45:05.659
but you tell them.
I think they respond to you better.

45:05.669 --> 45:07.594
Well, I am ultimately one of them.

45:07.604 --> 45:09.296
You shouldn't have made me
shave the 'stache.

45:09.306 --> 45:10.397
Yeah, right.

45:10.407 --> 45:14.735
Hey. Ingrid is asking if I was ever gay.
Do you know what that's about?

45:14.745 --> 45:16.745
No.

45:22.186 --> 45:25.986
Hi. I'm Pauline. This is Malcolm.

45:26.090 --> 45:27.715
We met you before.
We're your neighbors.

45:27.725 --> 45:30.190
You gonna cut that tree down?

45:31.061 --> 45:32.653
Well, we grew up with that tree,

45:32.663 --> 45:34.722
and we're getting married
under it on Saturday.

45:34.732 --> 45:41.362
Its roots are growing into our property.
It's rotting. It's killing our plants.

45:43.073 --> 45:47.578
We had the tree doctor out
and he said it was healthy.

45:48.712 --> 45:50.904
-Would it hurt you to say anything?
-What do you want from me?

45:50.914 --> 45:52.206
You're making me do
the whole fucking thing.

45:52.216 --> 45:54.475
-You brought up the tree.
-He brought up the tree.

45:54.485 --> 45:57.745
I'm sorry. This was better thought
through back at the house.

45:57.755 --> 45:59.179
We were wondering
if you and your wife,

45:59.189 --> 46:02.549
I'm sorry, I forgot her name,
would like to come over for a glass...

46:02.559 --> 46:05.252
You should ask her.
She makes the plans.

46:05.262 --> 46:07.262
I'm gonna go in now.

46:10.667 --> 46:14.695
I feel like you didn't give me a chance
to say what I wanted to say.

46:14.705 --> 46:17.264
-I want to punch that guy in the nose.
-You've never hit anyone.

46:17.274 --> 46:18.632
-I have too!
-Who?

46:18.642 --> 46:20.334
Lots of people. You don't know them.

46:20.344 --> 46:22.302
They're not around
'cause I punched them.

46:22.312 --> 46:27.410
Don't laugh, Pauline. It's not funny.
I'll punch your sister!

46:27.420 --> 46:28.709
The threat is not out there.

46:28.719 --> 46:32.112
It's in our house.
It's sleeping in my studio.

46:32.122 --> 46:34.414
I mean, I wouldn't actually hit her.

46:34.424 --> 46:37.684
But I feel like doing it.
She's such a fucking idiot.

46:37.694 --> 46:39.453
She's not an idiot.
You might not like her.

46:39.463 --> 46:41.321
She is. She's an idiot! You're an idiot.

46:41.331 --> 46:43.524
-Jesus!
-You're both fucking morons.

46:43.534 --> 46:46.760
I am so fucking... I am trying so hard.

46:46.770 --> 46:48.395
You don't give me any credit!

46:48.405 --> 46:50.870
-What is wrong?
-I don't know.

46:51.275 --> 46:55.402
I have the emotional version
of whatever bad feng shui would be.

46:55.412 --> 46:58.305
I don't know. You tell me.
You understand this shit.

46:58.315 --> 47:02.075
-Did you drink your teas?
-Yeah, I drank my fucking teas.

47:02.085 --> 47:04.278
Really, I think when you look back
at this you're going to see

47:04.288 --> 47:07.714
I'm not acting like a crazy person.
That this is the right reaction.

47:07.724 --> 47:11.889
In proportion with what's going on,
this is right.

47:19.937 --> 47:21.937
Let's make love.

47:31.281 --> 47:33.613
-Jim.
-Hey.

47:34.518 --> 47:36.518
How are you?

47:37.588 --> 47:39.584
-Dad!
-Claude!

47:39.594 --> 47:41.590
Hey.

47:41.725 --> 47:42.983
It was a difficult decision,

47:42.993 --> 47:45.752
because Claude has so many friends
in school now.

47:45.762 --> 47:49.656
But it's expensive, and Bronx Science
is a great public school.

47:49.666 --> 47:51.391
I didn't get into Stuyvesant.

47:51.401 --> 47:55.141
-He's not a good test taker.
-I went to Stuy.

47:55.272 --> 47:57.272
-Really?
-Really.

47:57.374 --> 48:00.400
I'd rather stay at Packer,
but it's so expensive.

48:00.410 --> 48:03.737
Josh is a great test taker,
but Claude thinks more abstractly.

48:03.747 --> 48:07.062
-He's more creative. Right?
-I guess so.

48:07.384 --> 48:11.144
I saw the one-armed man,
who really has two arms, at the bodega.

48:11.154 --> 48:13.580
Really?
Did you give him confusing change?

48:13.590 --> 48:19.019
I did. I tripped him up with some nickels
and a Canadian quarter.

48:19.029 --> 48:23.789
You know what I tried the other day?
Sitting down to pee.

48:23.934 --> 48:25.974
Have you done this, Jim?

48:26.503 --> 48:28.503
No.

48:29.473 --> 48:30.797
I haven't.

48:30.807 --> 48:32.866
It was a joke, really.
I was gonna call in Pauline

48:32.876 --> 48:34.668
and say, "Guess what I'm doing here?"

48:34.678 --> 48:36.470
Sorry I didn't get to have
that experience.

48:36.480 --> 48:38.272
I was just thinking, you know,

48:38.282 --> 48:41.108
my dad used to say,
"Why stand when you can sit?"

48:41.118 --> 48:43.577
And this is a really good example
of that.

48:43.587 --> 48:45.946
I mean, it took me a long time to try,
'cause I was embarrassed.

48:45.956 --> 48:47.314
But you guys do it all the time.

48:47.324 --> 48:50.817
I never sit in a public place.
I always squat and hover.

48:50.827 --> 48:54.154
Anyway, I recommend it.
At least to try it.

48:54.164 --> 48:55.923
Jim, I'm sorry about the room.

48:55.933 --> 48:59.860
It's usually Malcolm's storage room.
So, it's kind of makeshift right now.

48:59.870 --> 49:01.870
It's fine.

49:02.839 --> 49:04.839
Margot, open your gift.

49:05.642 --> 49:08.635
I get self-conscious opening presents
in front of people.

49:08.645 --> 49:09.136
I get self-conscious opening presents
in front of people.

49:09.146 --> 49:15.011
-Anyway, this weekend is about Pauline.
-Pooh, Margot. Go on, open it.

49:26.697 --> 49:28.737
Get on with it. Come on.

49:35.906 --> 49:37.331
Those look warm.

49:37.341 --> 49:42.781
I remember last year in Vermont
you said your feet were freezing.

49:44.147 --> 49:46.147
Thank you.

49:47.117 --> 49:49.117
You're welcome.

49:51.154 --> 49:53.194
I already have slippers.

49:53.290 --> 49:56.520
That's okay. Two sets are fine, right?

49:58.261 --> 50:01.888
It makes me sad to get
a present I already have.

50:01.898 --> 50:05.891
-Why?
-Makes me feel like you don't know me.

50:10.507 --> 50:11.665
What's wrong with your ear?

50:11.675 --> 50:14.868
I asked you not to come
and you did it anyway, so blithely.

50:14.878 --> 50:17.838
We need time alone to sort this out.
You can't just run away.

50:17.848 --> 50:19.940
Okay, we're here.
I'm giving you this time.

50:19.950 --> 50:21.950
Well...

50:21.985 --> 50:25.555
Now you're putting
too much pressure on me.

50:29.893 --> 50:31.518
What is that?

50:31.528 --> 50:34.292
Keep driving. Jim, Jim. No!

50:34.398 --> 50:36.398
-I'm just seeing.
-No.

50:39.102 --> 50:41.102
Stay right there.

50:45.208 --> 50:47.574
Please help me.

50:47.677 --> 50:51.374
-Please. He got hit by a car.
-Jim.

50:52.349 --> 50:54.241
Jim.

50:54.251 --> 50:58.045
-Careful. He might bite you.
-I got him. I got him.

50:58.055 --> 51:00.055
Hurry, he's dying!

51:00.824 --> 51:02.349
He didn't do anything.

51:02.359 --> 51:05.452
Roger's an innocent.
He's an innocent creature.

51:05.462 --> 51:06.853
-Oh, God.
-Margot.

51:06.863 --> 51:08.956
I can't stand her.

51:16.807 --> 51:18.765
You paid, didn't you?

51:18.775 --> 51:23.103
She didn't have her purse with her.
It wasn't so expensive.

51:23.113 --> 51:24.604
Roger's gonna live.

51:24.614 --> 51:30.139
I don't give a fuck about Roger,
and that makes me feel like shit.

51:30.754 --> 51:33.049
You make me feel like shit.

51:34.224 --> 51:36.116
-I wouldn't have stopped.
-Of course you would have.

51:36.126 --> 51:38.126
No, I wouldn't have.

51:38.829 --> 51:43.249
-I hate myself when I'm with you.
-Margot, I'm not...

51:46.536 --> 51:48.462
I can't talk to you
when you're this fucked up.

51:48.472 --> 51:52.933
You're just like Claude in that way.
You make me feel guilty.

51:52.943 --> 51:56.003
Sometimes, I find you so despicable.

52:19.503 --> 52:21.503
What's wrong?

52:24.107 --> 52:26.107
I don't know.

52:28.545 --> 52:34.325
Before you gave me your sweater,
I don't think I realized I was cold.

52:38.455 --> 52:40.582
Take me home and go away.

52:42.692 --> 52:47.521
If it were someone else,
I'd understand it. I'd feel sympathy even.

52:47.531 --> 52:52.291
But since it's me,
I just feel bad and horribly critical.

52:52.736 --> 52:54.594
I haven't been able to tell Claude
what's happening,

52:54.604 --> 52:56.984
and I have to. I'm going to.

52:57.207 --> 53:00.367
How can I be all these people?
How can I be married to Jim

53:00.377 --> 53:03.336
and fuck Dick and want them both,
and then neither of them?

53:03.346 --> 53:07.941
I know. We're at that age where
we're becoming invisible to men.

53:07.951 --> 53:11.678
If a guy wants to fuck us,
that's very tempting.

53:11.688 --> 53:12.846
What are you saying?

53:12.856 --> 53:16.082
I'm saying if you get your sense of self
from being fuckable

53:16.092 --> 53:19.152
and that starts to wane, it's very hard.

53:19.162 --> 53:22.923
I almost had an affair, too.
But you don't have to do it.

53:22.933 --> 53:27.233
You can, I don't know,
get a manicure or something.

53:29.606 --> 53:33.233
You know, I tell people
you're my closest friend.

53:33.243 --> 53:36.007
-I really miss you.
-Me, too.

53:36.112 --> 53:38.338
But I can't help feeling
that you really came to my wedding

53:38.348 --> 53:41.274
'cause I live a mile away
from the guy you're fucking.

53:41.284 --> 53:44.477
Come on, Pauline,
you make it sound like I'm using you.

53:44.487 --> 53:46.487
Yeah.

53:47.357 --> 53:49.357
You've got a...

53:50.060 --> 53:52.270
-Did I get it?
-I think so.

53:53.897 --> 53:56.756
Pauline, what are you doing
getting married to this guy?

53:56.766 --> 53:59.960
He's not good enough for you.
He's so coarse.

53:59.970 --> 54:03.363
He's like guys we rejected
when we were 1 6.

54:03.373 --> 54:06.700
You know,
don't make a mistake like this.

54:06.710 --> 54:08.668
I'm sorry. Maybe I have no right to say it.

54:08.678 --> 54:13.098
But you know I'm truthful,
so would you rather I lie?

54:14.584 --> 54:16.209
Who should I be with then?

54:16.219 --> 54:19.449
I don't know.
Someone who's your equal.

54:20.223 --> 54:23.783
You're so smart. You're brilliant.
You're funny.

54:23.793 --> 54:27.053
You're incredibly hilarious.
Paul, you're a great teacher.

54:27.063 --> 54:30.633
You're open to things.
You're so beautiful.

54:31.034 --> 54:33.764
Hey! Hey, you! You pick that up.

54:33.870 --> 54:36.396
I will call the police.
This is our property.

54:36.406 --> 54:38.406
Creeps.

54:54.157 --> 54:55.849
Wizard!

54:55.859 --> 54:58.852
-What happened to your dad?
-He went to Vermont.

54:58.862 --> 55:00.420
He didn't want to come to the wedding?

55:00.430 --> 55:04.170
I don't think he could. I think he couldn't.

55:04.501 --> 55:07.436
-You want to see me dance?
-Okay.

55:21.685 --> 55:23.685
Wizard.

55:24.321 --> 55:26.321
You're not watching.

55:33.296 --> 55:36.526
-Where you going?
-We have to get home.

55:40.070 --> 55:43.330
-Is that your girlfriend?
-No, she's my cousin.

55:43.340 --> 55:46.173
-You a fruity?
-No.

55:46.276 --> 55:48.836
-You a fruity?
-No.

55:54.984 --> 55:56.042
He's a Vogler.

55:56.052 --> 55:59.079
-Come on. He's just a stupid boy.
-Wait. I have a rock in my shoe.

55:59.089 --> 56:00.947
Come on, Ingrid!

56:00.957 --> 56:02.957
Liar!

56:04.127 --> 56:06.127
Ingrid, get him off me!

56:07.564 --> 56:10.156
You're fucking gay. You're fucking gay.

56:10.166 --> 56:12.166
No.

56:22.011 --> 56:24.011
Hangman's ass.

56:33.423 --> 56:35.973
-Don't run so fast.
-He bit me.

56:36.059 --> 56:38.425
-Who bit you?
-A Vogler.

56:38.528 --> 56:40.528
Let me see.

56:43.366 --> 56:45.291
All right. That's it. I'm calling the police.

56:45.301 --> 56:48.528
Don't! It'll get worse.
Why did you say anything to them?

56:48.538 --> 56:50.797
What are you talking about?
This isn't my fault.

56:50.807 --> 56:54.000
That boy bit me 'cause you couldn't
keep your fat mouth shut.

56:54.010 --> 56:56.002
Claude, you're being a jerk.

56:56.012 --> 56:59.752
You shit in your shoes
and then you fuck 'em!

57:00.945 --> 57:04.090
She wrote a story about Lenny and me.

57:05.283 --> 57:07.283
Yeah. It's in here.

57:08.219 --> 57:10.711
I mean, we were talking
almost every day at this point,

57:10.721 --> 57:12.280
and there was no warning.

57:12.290 --> 57:16.450
I mean, maybe a couple of remarks
that she'd used some things of ours.

57:16.460 --> 57:19.020
And then The New Yorker comes,
we have a subscription,

57:19.030 --> 57:21.026
and there's the story.

57:21.036 --> 57:25.793
And it's things we said and did.
Stuff I told her in confidence.

57:25.803 --> 57:28.062
I think it helped end our marriage.

57:28.072 --> 57:31.803
I read it and I thought, "She hates me."

57:31.909 --> 57:33.909
She doesn't hate you.

57:34.445 --> 57:36.445
You think?

57:37.181 --> 57:40.374
Margot tried to murder me
when we were girls.

57:40.384 --> 57:42.910
She put me on a baking sheet,
sprinkled me with paprika,

57:42.920 --> 57:44.920
and put me in the oven.

57:49.360 --> 57:51.360
Jim was here.

57:51.762 --> 57:53.762
Is Jim still writing?

57:55.032 --> 57:58.347
I told him to go to Vermont without me.

57:58.803 --> 58:03.223
I'd like to see him tell a linear story
for a change.

58:03.541 --> 58:05.700
Jim never wanted to make it easy
for the reader, did he?

58:05.710 --> 58:10.215
The nicest man I ever met,
but he can't play the game.

58:10.881 --> 58:15.046
I'm not gonna be joining him.
I'm gonna stay here.

58:15.419 --> 58:17.419
We'll see.

58:18.356 --> 58:20.356
All right?

58:21.192 --> 58:23.192
Okay?

58:24.061 --> 58:26.441
I didn't ask you to do that.

58:29.967 --> 58:32.262
That guy is pointing at us.

58:33.104 --> 58:37.331
I'm very interested in your story
"Middle Children."

58:37.341 --> 58:40.538
The father is a loathsome character,

58:40.644 --> 58:44.299
yet we also feel
a strange sympathy for him.

58:45.850 --> 58:51.812
Well, I was really interested in exploring
a father/daughter relationship.

58:51.822 --> 58:57.988
While he clings to her,
desperately, he suffocates her really.

58:58.429 --> 59:04.425
He also silently resents
the responsibility of parenthood.

59:06.070 --> 59:09.663
There's this sexualized
push-pull with Daphne,

59:09.673 --> 59:13.769
-which I find...
-He craves isolation.

59:14.912 --> 59:17.104
I always saw him as someone who

59:17.114 --> 59:20.914
so over-identifies with
everyone around him

59:22.086 --> 59:25.920
that he begins to lose
all sense of himself.

59:26.590 --> 59:28.916
But you make his only recourse
to abandon his family,

59:28.926 --> 59:33.601
-including his beloved daughter.
-Yes, yes, that's true.

59:34.432 --> 59:38.392
I write historical fiction,
so I don't have to answer to this,

59:38.402 --> 59:42.329
but I wonder, for someone
who writes so nakedly about family,

59:42.339 --> 59:45.740
how autobiographical is this portrait?

59:47.711 --> 59:49.937
My father was a loving person.

59:49.947 --> 59:53.107
He had his days, of course,
but he was devoted to us as children.

59:53.117 --> 59:57.707
I would never have written this portrait,
were it true.

59:58.322 --> 01:00:04.527
But I'm interested in how the father
could be, in fact, a portrait of you.

01:00:08.499 --> 01:00:10.499
I don't...

01:00:11.669 --> 01:00:14.219
Why do you assume that it's...

01:00:15.072 --> 01:00:18.132
That, I mean, we all take from life.

01:00:22.179 --> 01:00:25.005
I had to have our refrigerator repaired
the other day

01:00:25.015 --> 01:00:27.575
at our apartment in Manhattan,

01:00:27.685 --> 01:00:32.088
and I was alone with this guy.

01:00:32.189 --> 01:00:33.981
I think he was Puerto Rican.

01:00:33.991 --> 01:00:37.483
He was sent over by Whirlpool,

01:00:37.595 --> 01:00:41.463
who I think it is, makes our fridge.

01:00:44.602 --> 01:00:47.595
Although he did say that he worked for
an independent organization,

01:00:47.605 --> 01:00:49.985
that Whirlpool subcontracts.

01:00:50.708 --> 01:00:52.748
I think he was retarded.

01:00:55.779 --> 01:00:57.779
There was...

01:00:58.382 --> 01:01:03.183
There was an anger in him,
and suddenly,

01:01:04.455 --> 01:01:07.600
suddenly I became afraid for my life.

01:01:10.394 --> 01:01:14.922
I called Jim at NYU, and I...

01:01:15.099 --> 01:01:17.224
I asked him to come home.

01:01:22.606 --> 01:01:26.431
I think it was Frigidaire
who made our fridge.

01:01:29.847 --> 01:01:34.437
I'm gonna need...
I'm gonna need to take a moment here.

01:01:44.428 --> 01:01:46.428
You're an asshole.

01:02:01.478 --> 01:02:04.939
-I need to be alone right now, okay?
-What's wrong?

01:02:04.949 --> 01:02:09.181
I don't know.
I'll tell you sometime. Go on.

01:02:09.653 --> 01:02:11.011
Are you sure?

01:02:11.021 --> 01:02:14.014
Yeah. Go with Mom. I'll see you later.

01:02:14.024 --> 01:02:16.383
-You said Mom.
-You know what I mean.

01:02:16.393 --> 01:02:18.393
Go with Pauline.

01:02:18.495 --> 01:02:22.659
Jesus, do I need to spell it out for you?

01:02:25.302 --> 01:02:27.302
Go with her.

01:02:29.173 --> 01:02:31.638
There was blood on the floor,

01:02:31.675 --> 01:02:35.903
and it was cold,
and it was snowing inside the hallway.

01:02:35.913 --> 01:02:39.840
There was all these like
weird like torture devices,

01:02:39.850 --> 01:02:44.178
and to get out of them,
you had to like torture yourself.

01:02:44.188 --> 01:02:46.046
I wasn't so scared
while it was happening.

01:02:46.056 --> 01:02:48.983
I was more scared afterwards.
It was like

01:02:48.993 --> 01:02:52.186
I was in it and I was just spectating.

01:02:52.196 --> 01:02:55.341
I didn't have to do any of the stuff.

01:02:55.733 --> 01:03:00.628
I could teach you to swim if you like.
We wouldn't have to tell your mom.

01:03:00.638 --> 01:03:03.266
I don't really want to.

01:03:04.475 --> 01:03:07.911
-I like Malcolm.
-You do? Good.

01:03:10.147 --> 01:03:12.187
I do, too. I don't know.

01:03:13.817 --> 01:03:15.943
It's hard, I think,
to find people in the world

01:03:15.953 --> 01:03:18.588
you love more than your family.

01:03:19.189 --> 01:03:22.716
You're your mom's favorite.
Do you know that?

01:03:22.726 --> 01:03:26.721
She's always liked you best,
more than Jim even.

01:03:27.297 --> 01:03:28.889
Has she talked to you yet?

01:03:28.899 --> 01:03:32.335
I don't think so. About what?

01:03:32.436 --> 01:03:34.432
You okay?

01:03:34.442 --> 01:03:37.164
It's hard to see your mom
like that, right?

01:03:37.174 --> 01:03:38.565
Get attacked like that?

01:03:38.575 --> 01:03:42.403
It was mean what he did.
I think it was really shitty.

01:03:42.413 --> 01:03:45.218
-I think Dick's an asshole.
-Yeah.

01:03:48.085 --> 01:03:50.383
You know,

01:03:50.487 --> 01:03:54.048
your mom's going through
a rough time right now.

01:03:54.058 --> 01:03:57.288
And she can be scary when she's angry.

01:03:57.995 --> 01:04:02.189
Whatever she says, like if she tells you
she's leaving your father, just know,

01:04:02.199 --> 01:04:05.004
well, she often changes her mind.

01:04:05.069 --> 01:04:09.659
And I don't want you to worry
about anything right now.

01:04:11.375 --> 01:04:13.969
-He's cutting it down.
-Good.

01:04:14.078 --> 01:04:16.870
My dad's late to pick me up.
I hope I'm not a pain.

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:19.005
You're not a pain, Maisy.

01:04:28.492 --> 01:04:31.618
I told Paul
I didn't want you guys to come.

01:04:31.628 --> 01:04:34.093
I thought it was interesting.

01:04:34.631 --> 01:04:38.025
-What did Paul say?
-I think she liked it.

01:04:38.035 --> 01:04:40.035
Yeah, right.

01:04:41.572 --> 01:04:45.008
-Did you talk about me afterwards?
-No.

01:04:46.110 --> 01:04:49.203
-I can tell you're lying.
-We didn't, Mom.

01:04:49.213 --> 01:04:51.213
I don't trust her.

01:04:53.650 --> 01:04:57.211
Pauline told me
she's very disappointed in you.

01:04:57.221 --> 01:05:00.791
-Why?
-She thinks you laze about the house.

01:05:00.858 --> 01:05:04.853
Ingrid's always offering to help
clean and cook.

01:05:05.596 --> 01:05:09.890
She made bracelets for all the guests.
Even Malcolm puts up the tent.

01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:10.157
She made bracelets for all the guests.
Even Malcolm puts up the tent.

01:05:10.167 --> 01:05:12.926
You wait until everyone else
does it for you.

01:05:12.936 --> 01:05:15.401
-That's not true.
-It is true.

01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:20.134
I wish I'd taught you better manners.

01:05:20.144 --> 01:05:23.237
I can try to make popovers,
if I can remember how.

01:05:23.247 --> 01:05:25.247
Don't bother.

01:05:30.587 --> 01:05:33.647
Why are you looking at me like that?

01:05:33.724 --> 01:05:36.699
I just see how much you've changed.

01:05:37.261 --> 01:05:41.922
Your body language.
You used to be rounder, more graceful.

01:05:41.932 --> 01:05:44.901
You're so stiff now, so blasé.

01:05:48.105 --> 01:05:50.164
I can't explain it.

01:05:54.511 --> 01:05:56.511
It's okay though.

01:06:07.457 --> 01:06:09.457
You're still handsome.

01:06:11.728 --> 01:06:14.288
Are you able to do this yourself?

01:06:14.298 --> 01:06:18.123
Pauline, do you want me
to cut it down or not?

01:06:18.168 --> 01:06:20.168
Watch the tent.

01:06:35.352 --> 01:06:37.177
I liked how it looked on Vogler.

01:06:37.187 --> 01:06:41.348
I think it's over between Margot
and Dick. He was so cruel to her today.

01:06:41.358 --> 01:06:44.151
And poor Claude had to watch it all.

01:06:44.161 --> 01:06:45.452
She should just get out of the marriage,

01:06:45.462 --> 01:06:47.754
and then she can fuck
whoever she wants, you know.

01:06:47.764 --> 01:06:49.723
And Dick Koosman...

01:06:49.733 --> 01:06:53.060
I agree.
I hate the idea of Dick fucking Margot.

01:06:53.070 --> 01:06:54.928
What does that mean?
You want to fuck Margot?

01:06:54.938 --> 01:06:56.864
Pauline, that's not what I said.

01:06:56.874 --> 01:07:00.300
I know you have a crush on her.
You already told me that.

01:07:00.310 --> 01:07:02.102
I didn't say that!

01:07:02.112 --> 01:07:05.839
I said I thought she was attractive
after you grilled me.

01:07:05.849 --> 01:07:09.576
She has no interest in me anyway,
not that it would matter if she did.

01:07:09.586 --> 01:07:12.446
Have you ever done anything like that?

01:07:12.456 --> 01:07:16.451
-What do you mean?
-Have you ever cheated on me?

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:19.859
No! Can I do this?

01:07:20.530 --> 01:07:24.791
Those e-mails that you have
with that student of mine?

01:07:24.801 --> 01:07:25.959
Did that...

01:07:25.969 --> 01:07:28.161
-I know you said it was nothing.
-It was.

01:07:28.171 --> 01:07:31.038
I just... Can you say it again?

01:07:31.141 --> 01:07:34.201
I just did. Now can I cut down the tree?

01:07:34.211 --> 01:07:36.703
-You never did anything with her?
-No.

01:07:36.713 --> 01:07:41.013
She e-mailed me
after that reading at the college,

01:07:41.318 --> 01:07:43.610
-and, you know, we were friends.
-Right.

01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:46.313
Just a regular friendship
between you and a 20-year-old girl.

01:07:46.323 --> 01:07:48.615
Pauline,
how many times do I have to say it?

01:07:48.625 --> 01:07:50.017
But why don't I believe it?

01:07:50.027 --> 01:07:52.152
Because Margot can't understand
why you're with me,

01:07:52.162 --> 01:07:55.555
and now when she's around,
you look for things.

01:07:55.565 --> 01:07:57.658
-You promise?
-I promise.

01:07:59.169 --> 01:08:01.637
Okay. I'm sorry.

01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:05.640
It's okay.

01:08:17.421 --> 01:08:20.912
-I'm gonna tell you something.
-What?

01:08:21.024 --> 01:08:24.849
-I don't want to lose you though, okay?
-What?

01:08:26.496 --> 01:08:29.386
I'm gonna tell you, just let me...

01:08:31.335 --> 01:08:32.926
Maisy.

01:08:32.935 --> 01:08:35.228
-I don't wanna know.
-We didn't really do anything.

01:08:35.238 --> 01:08:36.529
We were goofing around.

01:08:36.540 --> 01:08:39.832
I was making fun of her
'cause she dates a jock.

01:08:39.843 --> 01:08:43.636
I shouldn't have put myself
in that position, I know that.

01:08:43.647 --> 01:08:47.240
We brushed lips.
Really, it was hardly a kiss.

01:08:47.250 --> 01:08:50.055
And then we stopped. That was it.

01:08:51.455 --> 01:08:53.346
Our tongues touched.

01:08:53.357 --> 01:08:56.383
I don't wanna undersell it either.
I mean, we made out.

01:08:56.393 --> 01:08:58.759
I made out with her.

01:08:58.862 --> 01:09:02.261
I don't know why. I don't even like her.

01:09:02.799 --> 01:09:04.799
It's been a heady time.

01:09:06.569 --> 01:09:11.500
What are you thinking?
Please tell me what you're thinking.

01:09:17.381 --> 01:09:18.904
Has anyone seen Wizard?

01:09:18.915 --> 01:09:21.109
No. Where's Maisy?

01:09:28.091 --> 01:09:32.850
Hi. Sorry, I had to go.
I hope that's okay. I used yours.

01:09:36.733 --> 01:09:42.069
I love your wedding dress.
It's so unconventional and great.

01:09:58.722 --> 01:10:01.350
-Is everything okay?
-Nothing.

01:10:02.859 --> 01:10:04.951
Hey, Claude,
do you want to play croquet?

01:10:04.961 --> 01:10:06.961
Okay.

01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:18.540
There's Dick!

01:10:21.445 --> 01:10:23.170
Dad!

01:10:23.180 --> 01:10:25.180
Malcolm...

01:10:25.482 --> 01:10:28.076
-Is it almost ready?
-Almost.

01:10:59.516 --> 01:11:04.283
I didn't do anything!
I didn't do anything! No!

01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:13.052
You fucking sleazebag!

01:11:19.369 --> 01:11:23.772
Fuck off, dickhead! No! No!

01:11:25.675 --> 01:11:31.625
-I don't ever want to see you again.
-You fucking dickbag! She's lying!

01:11:35.585 --> 01:11:37.585
Oh, man!

01:11:52.602 --> 01:11:56.902
He looked everywhere
and tried to find her

01:11:57.007 --> 01:11:59.432
-Come with me to New York.
-I can't talk about it.

01:11:59.442 --> 01:12:02.302
Okay. But you can't marry him.
I mean, you have to leave.

01:12:02.312 --> 01:12:04.404
We can think about what to do
with the baby when we get to...

01:12:04.414 --> 01:12:06.706
-Margot, I can't.
-Don't turn vague. Listen to me.

01:12:06.716 --> 01:12:08.608
I want you to pack all your things
and get out of here.

01:12:08.618 --> 01:12:10.911
You can take our car
and leave it at the ferry.

01:12:10.921 --> 01:12:12.921
I can make popovers.

01:12:14.257 --> 01:12:16.623
Do you love me? Good.

01:12:16.893 --> 01:12:19.152
Don't you take this out on me.
I'm on your side.

01:12:19.162 --> 01:12:20.220
No, you're not.

01:12:20.230 --> 01:12:21.988
I kept my mouth shut
because I wanted to...

01:12:21.998 --> 01:12:25.725
No, you haven't kept your mouth shut.
No, you haven't kept your mouth shut!

01:12:25.735 --> 01:12:30.096
Okay, I told you. And I was right.
I mean, he's done an insane thing.

01:12:30.106 --> 01:12:33.300
You don't know this man.
What he did is criminal.

01:12:33.310 --> 01:12:36.200
-Margot, I can't.
-It's pedophilia.

01:12:37.814 --> 01:12:39.814
Get out.

01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:44.945
Becky and I talk about you,
about what a monster you are.

01:12:44.955 --> 01:12:47.480
Is it 'cause Mom gave me the house?

01:12:47.490 --> 01:12:51.151
We've been talking about you.
Becky can't stand you.

01:12:51.161 --> 01:12:54.154
Becky says you have
borderline personality disorder.

01:12:54.164 --> 01:12:57.357
-What are you saying?
-Can't I have anything?

01:12:57.367 --> 01:13:00.327
What was I thinking?
I can't have anything.

01:13:00.337 --> 01:13:04.899
I let you in. God damn, dude!
You're such an asshole!

01:13:06.343 --> 01:13:10.336
You hate me.
You're such a fucking asshole!

01:13:10.447 --> 01:13:13.780
Get out of my fucking house! Get out!

01:13:13.883 --> 01:13:17.043
I don't recognize you.
It's like you're channeling someone.

01:13:17.053 --> 01:13:19.053
Ingrid!

01:13:19.656 --> 01:13:20.247
Ingrid!

01:13:20.257 --> 01:13:22.182
Ingrid!

01:13:22.192 --> 01:13:24.192
Ingrid!

01:13:30.667 --> 01:13:32.667
Come on.

01:13:35.138 --> 01:13:36.229
Okay.

01:13:36.239 --> 01:13:39.979
-It wasn't gonna fall.
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:13:41.911 --> 01:13:43.911
Wizard!

01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:08.595
I thought you couldn't drive.

01:14:08.605 --> 01:14:11.598
Of course I can drive.
Why does everyone say that?

01:14:11.608 --> 01:14:13.199
I used to drive.

01:14:13.209 --> 01:14:15.635
We have to call people and cancel.

01:14:15.645 --> 01:14:17.645
Can I still sing?

01:14:20.850 --> 01:14:24.210
-You do smell.
-Well, I'm not wearing any deodorant.

01:14:24.220 --> 01:14:26.220
-Shit.
-What?

01:14:26.289 --> 01:14:30.919
I don't think... No.
We don't have any brakes.

01:14:31.928 --> 01:14:34.287
-The brakes are bad. That's right.
-What does that mean?

01:14:34.297 --> 01:14:38.258
-What do you think it means?
-I mean, what can we do?

01:14:38.268 --> 01:14:40.193
Mom!

01:14:40.203 --> 01:14:42.203
-Don't!
-Shit!

01:14:47.010 --> 01:14:49.050
I've ruined these shoes.

01:14:54.250 --> 01:14:56.142
Mom, are you okay?

01:14:56.152 --> 01:14:58.152
Don't look. Shit!

01:14:59.656 --> 01:15:02.284
-Mom, what happened?
-Nothing.

01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:05.670
Did she poop in her pants?

01:15:06.062 --> 01:15:08.988
It happens to everyone, not just babies.

01:15:08.998 --> 01:15:11.803
It'll happen to you too, someday.

01:15:15.038 --> 01:15:17.673
I left Mom and Becky a message.

01:15:17.907 --> 01:15:21.902
I don't think Mom knows
how to work the machine.

01:15:23.146 --> 01:15:24.671
I can hear it flapping.

01:15:24.681 --> 01:15:28.676
You should take care of that.
It can hatch eggs.

01:15:52.242 --> 01:15:54.437
Okay, I'm gonna tell him.

01:15:54.744 --> 01:15:57.440
No. I don't want him to...

01:15:58.314 --> 01:16:01.119
And I'll put him on the bus. Bye.

01:16:09.225 --> 01:16:13.186
Sweetie, there's a bus that leaves to
Vermont from town tomorrow morning.

01:16:13.196 --> 01:16:16.456
I just talked to your dad,
and he'll be there to pick you up.

01:16:16.466 --> 01:16:19.299
-Aren't you coming?
-No.

01:16:20.537 --> 01:16:21.961
Why not?

01:16:21.971 --> 01:16:24.998
Because I have to help out
Paul and Ingrid.

01:16:25.008 --> 01:16:28.068
Then I don't want to leave tomorrow.

01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:39.620
There's Malcolm!

01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:42.390
No, honey.

01:16:43.359 --> 01:16:46.164
I can't live in that house alone.

01:16:46.596 --> 01:16:47.821
You're gonna be fine.

01:16:47.831 --> 01:16:51.791
Maybe I could get a place in Brooklyn,
Williamsburg or something.

01:16:51.801 --> 01:16:53.426
People are living there, right?

01:16:53.436 --> 01:16:56.629
No, you don't want to live there.
It's only young people.

01:16:56.639 --> 01:16:59.614
But what do you think of that idea?

01:16:59.742 --> 01:17:01.972
Maybe. Maybe. Let's see.

01:17:02.512 --> 01:17:04.237
Listen, if you don't want
to come with me,

01:17:04.247 --> 01:17:06.773
I'm sure Mom will let you stay with her.

01:17:06.783 --> 01:17:09.075
You're already trying to pass me off
on to Mom.

01:17:09.085 --> 01:17:12.315
Don't say that. You're coming with me.

01:17:12.355 --> 01:17:13.746
You don't even know
where you're gonna live.

01:17:13.756 --> 01:17:16.616
You might have to move in
with Mom, too.

01:17:16.626 --> 01:17:18.626
What?

01:17:19.295 --> 01:17:23.205
You said you were going to tell him.
I'm sorry.

01:17:25.568 --> 01:17:27.568
What have I done?

01:17:29.539 --> 01:17:31.539
What have I done?

01:17:45.221 --> 01:17:47.712
-What?
-Nothing.

01:17:49.425 --> 01:17:52.655
Just then I felt so much love for you.

01:17:54.364 --> 01:17:56.364
Good night, Mommy.

01:18:05.141 --> 01:18:06.332
Hey!

01:18:06.342 --> 01:18:08.434
You cannot write about this.
You can't have it.

01:18:08.444 --> 01:18:10.036
That wasn't about you.

01:18:10.046 --> 01:18:11.204
You already took a part of my life,

01:18:11.214 --> 01:18:12.772
that story you wrote
about Lenny and me.

01:18:12.782 --> 01:18:14.274
-It wasn't about you.
-It ruined our marriage.

01:18:14.284 --> 01:18:15.341
Oh, God.

01:18:15.351 --> 01:18:17.391
You can't have any more.

01:18:17.487 --> 01:18:19.579
And that goes for Ingrid
and Malcolm and Wizard.

01:18:19.589 --> 01:18:21.314
We all own our own rights.
They're not for sale.

01:18:21.324 --> 01:18:23.417
Give it back. Give it.

01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:28.054
If I could read your handwriting,
I'm sure I'd be furious.

01:18:28.064 --> 01:18:33.359
But if I ever see a story that involves
a hotel room or any of this shit,

01:18:33.369 --> 01:18:36.429
I will fucking take your bowels out.

01:18:45.448 --> 01:18:49.698
You've now successfully ruined
two of my marriages.

01:18:49.786 --> 01:18:51.911
You're not wearing any underwear.

01:18:51.921 --> 01:18:55.584
It's hot. I'm pregnant. Move over. Jesus.

01:18:56.426 --> 01:18:59.793
You're not hot. Your feet are cold.

01:18:59.896 --> 01:19:03.559
Stop touching me. I am so hot.
Feel my head.

01:19:07.704 --> 01:19:09.704
You got a fever.

01:19:09.772 --> 01:19:12.599
I don't have a fever. I'm pregnant.

01:19:12.609 --> 01:19:16.179
-Are you always like this?
-Get used to it.

01:19:17.347 --> 01:19:21.975
Mom and Becky share a bed.
You and I will probably get the other.

01:19:21.985 --> 01:19:24.535
You should just go to Vermont.

01:19:25.488 --> 01:19:27.683
You know, I was thinking,

01:19:28.524 --> 01:19:32.519
if you want,
you and Ingrid could go to Vermont.

01:19:33.162 --> 01:19:35.162
Keep Claude company.

01:19:35.665 --> 01:19:37.665
Jim adores you.

01:19:39.636 --> 01:19:42.161
You don't like Malcolm
because you're not attracted to him.

01:19:42.171 --> 01:19:44.171
-Will you do it?
-No.

01:19:45.708 --> 01:19:47.748
I won't do that for you.

01:19:53.483 --> 01:19:56.203
Did you two talk about me today?

01:19:58.321 --> 01:20:00.321
What did you say?

01:20:04.193 --> 01:20:07.423
I told him you often change your mind.

01:20:27.483 --> 01:20:29.909
I'm sorry, sweetie.
There's something wrong with me.

01:20:29.919 --> 01:20:33.379
-I'm gonna call him.
-Don't do that, I'm telling you...

01:20:33.389 --> 01:20:35.915
I need some clothes and things.

01:20:35.925 --> 01:20:38.918
He should get the hell out of our house.

01:20:38.928 --> 01:20:43.348
Okay, I'll tell him to get the hell out
of our house.

01:20:51.441 --> 01:20:53.602
You left it in my room.

01:21:04.587 --> 01:21:06.953
The tent looks so lonely.

01:21:07.056 --> 01:21:08.815
There's no one to get married in it.

01:21:08.825 --> 01:21:11.630
I know, and it's totally smashed.

01:21:11.694 --> 01:21:16.155
I'm such a fucking idiot.
Please don't take me seriously.

01:21:16.165 --> 01:21:20.927
I mean, take me seriously,
but not the fucked-up parts, you know.

01:21:20.937 --> 01:21:23.997
I love you so much. Please marry me.

01:21:25.975 --> 01:21:28.367
You can't do what you did again.
Do you understand?

01:21:28.377 --> 01:21:30.303
I promise.

01:21:30.313 --> 01:21:32.313
No matter how tempting.

01:21:46.462 --> 01:21:48.953
I don't know. I don't know.

01:21:49.966 --> 01:21:54.327
I ate some of the cake.
I don't know why, but I did it.

01:21:54.337 --> 01:21:56.396
Well, how was it?

01:21:57.140 --> 01:21:58.564
Good.

01:21:58.574 --> 01:22:02.401
Not too sweet? They sometimes make
their stuff too sweet.

01:22:02.411 --> 01:22:03.870
Maybe.

01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:07.008
Maybe it was. I didn't even notice.

01:22:07.116 --> 01:22:10.608
They fucked up the cake. How sad.

01:22:11.654 --> 01:22:15.090
I miss you. I love our little baby.

01:22:15.892 --> 01:22:17.892
I miss you.

01:22:20.396 --> 01:22:24.731
I miss you, too.
Maybe we should do another seminar.

01:22:30.473 --> 01:22:33.023
I can't understand you, honey.

01:22:41.317 --> 01:22:43.867
Honey, I can't understand you.

01:22:46.088 --> 01:22:48.781
There's Nana and Aunt Becky,
and they have ice cream.

01:22:48.791 --> 01:22:50.583
They didn't get my message.

01:22:50.593 --> 01:22:52.685
I told you, she doesn't know
how to work the machine.

01:22:52.695 --> 01:22:54.735
What, you're not coming?

01:22:54.831 --> 01:22:56.789
I'm coming. I'm coming.
What did he say?

01:22:56.799 --> 01:22:58.524
-Mom!
-Nana!

01:22:58.534 --> 01:23:00.530
-What did he say?
-Nana!

01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:03.196
-Mom, hey.
-Hey, was that Margot I saw?

01:23:03.206 --> 01:23:05.932
-Don't look, keep walking.
-Why are we going this way?

01:23:05.942 --> 01:23:08.577
We have to get you to your bus.

01:23:10.246 --> 01:23:12.246
Did you do something?

01:23:12.448 --> 01:23:15.083
What do you mean, do something?

01:23:15.418 --> 01:23:17.343
I mean,
why is the wedding not happening?

01:23:17.353 --> 01:23:19.078
Is it something that you did?

01:23:19.088 --> 01:23:22.682
Pauline has transferred
all of her stuff onto me.

01:23:22.692 --> 01:23:25.327
I don't understand her anymore.

01:23:26.729 --> 01:23:30.022
Why did she pick that guy?
It's really berserk.

01:23:30.032 --> 01:23:34.282
You know, she referred to me
as her closest friend.

01:23:35.171 --> 01:23:39.031
We never see one another.
I mean, we're not close,

01:23:39.041 --> 01:23:41.081
even if we wanted to be.

01:23:48.484 --> 01:23:49.909
But was there anything real?

01:23:49.919 --> 01:23:52.812
No. How many times do I have to say it?

01:23:52.822 --> 01:23:56.052
Jesus, do you think that little of me?

01:24:00.062 --> 01:24:03.556
It's good you're going.
I wouldn't want to be around me, either.

01:24:03.566 --> 01:24:06.125
Are you gonna find
Pauline and Nana after I leave?

01:24:06.135 --> 01:24:09.365
I don't know. Maybe I'll go to church.

01:24:10.339 --> 01:24:14.600
-Are you angry at me?
-No, honey, I'm not mad at you.

01:24:14.610 --> 01:24:17.003
Everything's fine.
I'm not mad at anyone.

01:24:17.013 --> 01:24:20.172
-Can you come with me?
-No. You know that.

01:24:20.182 --> 01:24:22.475
Now we should talk about
the next few months a little bit,

01:24:22.485 --> 01:24:25.144
-and what's gonna happen.
-I don't like Vermont.

01:24:25.154 --> 01:24:26.979
Your dad is gonna be very happy
to see you,

01:24:26.989 --> 01:24:30.416
and I'm sure Josh is just
dying to hang out.

01:24:30.426 --> 01:24:32.251
Please come, Mom.

01:24:32.261 --> 01:24:34.525
Stop it, okay? Stop it.

01:24:38.267 --> 01:24:41.394
You used to need me
to watch you when you played.

01:24:41.404 --> 01:24:42.495
What do you mean?

01:24:42.505 --> 01:24:44.931
When you first started playing
with friends, you wouldn't do it,

01:24:44.941 --> 01:24:46.941
unless I was watching.

01:24:46.976 --> 01:24:49.669
You were always afraid
I was gonna go out the back door.

01:24:49.679 --> 01:24:51.570
I don't know
where you thought I would go.

01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:54.470
Our backyard didn't lead anywhere.

01:24:58.421 --> 01:25:00.546
I masturbated last night.

01:25:00.823 --> 01:25:04.150
While everyone was asleep,
I went into the bathroom and did it.

01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:07.560
You don't need to tell me that, sweetie.

01:25:09.899 --> 01:25:13.384
-You've got to go.
-How will you get home?

01:25:13.636 --> 01:25:15.127
I don't know.

01:25:15.137 --> 01:25:19.597
Maybe I'll get Dick to drive me to the...

01:25:21.877 --> 01:25:25.277
I lost the word for a second, the train.

01:25:25.681 --> 01:25:28.307
Come on.
You always don't want to leave me,

01:25:28.317 --> 01:25:31.110
and you always have a good time
once you do.

01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:37.665
-I think you like getting away from me.
-I don't. I like hanging out with you.

01:25:54.410 --> 01:25:57.300
They make your face look too wide.

01:26:00.282 --> 01:26:02.662
-See you soon.
-Bye, sweetie.

01:26:03.285 --> 01:26:04.710
Say you'll see me soon.

01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:08.087
Hey, you're acting like a baby. Go on.

01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:46.660
Wait!

01:26:48.264 --> 01:26:50.264
Wait!

01:26:50.933 --> 01:26:52.933
Wait!

01:26:55.771 --> 01:26:57.771
Wait!

01:27:08.651 --> 01:27:12.051
-Did you see me running out there?
-Yeah.

01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:19.970
That was a lot of running.

01:27:21.363 --> 01:27:23.456
I'm out of breath.
