WEBVTT

00:08.592 --> 00:10.886
How awesome
is Maya Fleishacker?

00:10.886 --> 00:12.596
She's cute, she's smart,

00:12.596 --> 00:15.224
and she's got a purple belt
in kickboxing.

00:15.224 --> 00:16.726
I have a purple belt.

00:16.726 --> 00:18.519
But you keep telling me
not to wear it.

00:18.519 --> 00:21.772
Wait.
She's finally alone.

00:21.772 --> 00:25.359
Now's my chance to talk to her.
What should I say?

00:25.359 --> 00:27.403
For someone like
Maya Fleishacker,

00:27.403 --> 00:30.322
you gotta be sophisticated...
grown-up.

00:30.322 --> 00:32.908
Ooh, ask her if she read
Fifty Shades of Grey.

00:32.908 --> 00:35.786
- What's that?
- Some book my mom really liked.

00:35.786 --> 00:37.496
She even read it in the bathtub.

00:38.164 --> 00:39.248
I'll give it a shot.

00:40.833 --> 00:42.960
What's the worst
that could happen?

00:46.213 --> 00:48.132
Hey, Maya.

00:48.132 --> 00:50.176
How about that
Fifty Shades of Grey?

00:50.176 --> 00:52.094
What?

00:52.094 --> 00:55.055
Uh...it's my favorite book.

00:55.055 --> 00:58.726
It's, um...
it's very grown-up.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.811
It's about a painter

01:00.811 --> 01:02.688
who, uh, uh...

01:02.688 --> 01:04.647
who loves the color gray,

01:04.647 --> 01:06.984
and, uh, I...
it's really sophisticated,

01:06.984 --> 01:09.195
and I read it
when I take my bath.

01:13.574 --> 01:14.950
Wait, I just...

01:21.832 --> 01:23.834
Don't worry.
One day, you'll laugh at this

01:23.834 --> 01:25.920
as hard as everyone else is.

01:27.000 --> 01:33.074

02:11.340 --> 02:13.717
Oh, hey, Terry.
How are...

02:15.177 --> 02:16.971
So...

02:16.971 --> 02:19.890
didn't we already have
the flag discussion?

02:19.890 --> 02:21.517
Oh, I thought that
was about the size,

02:21.517 --> 02:22.893
which I totally agree with.

02:22.893 --> 02:23.811
The other one
took half an hour

02:23.811 --> 02:25.396
to fold every night.

02:25.396 --> 02:26.647
Okay, I don't know whether
to yell at you

02:26.647 --> 02:28.315
- or salute.
- That's funny.

02:28.315 --> 02:30.025
You're not the first person
to say that to me.

02:30.025 --> 02:31.777
Funny, yeah.
Well, here's hoping

02:31.777 --> 02:33.279
I'm the last.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.283
Hey there, neighbor!

02:37.283 --> 02:40.119
Wanna hang out a bit and rap
with your old Uncle Terry?

02:40.119 --> 02:42.830
I got some, uh, cold hot wings
and warm iced tea.

02:42.830 --> 02:46.083
Know how to get a jigsaw blade
unstuck from a shop class wall?

02:46.083 --> 02:47.459
No, I do not.

02:47.459 --> 02:49.545
Then no, thanks,
but no, thanks.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.300
Ah, hey there, neighbor!

02:54.300 --> 02:56.844
Oh, your shirt's a little torn.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.929
Stee-rike two.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.353
Mm, sorry.

03:06.353 --> 03:09.732
These rutabaga chips are
putting up a heck of a fight.

03:11.025 --> 03:13.277
These bills are killing me.

03:13.277 --> 03:15.154
Oh, and this one is
actually threatening me.

03:15.154 --> 03:17.406
So looks like we're
changing dentists again.

03:17.406 --> 03:19.867
You're not alone in this, Beth.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.745
Everybody's having
to tighten their belt.

03:22.745 --> 03:25.372
Even George Clooney is noodling
with flying commercial.

03:28.042 --> 03:30.586
Wait, this can't be right.

03:30.586 --> 03:34.506
There's no way that Patrick
had a gym membership.

03:34.506 --> 03:35.966
Yeah, neither
of my boys were...

03:35.966 --> 03:37.968
traditional athletes.

03:37.968 --> 03:40.638
Terry was really good
at hide-and-seek,

03:40.638 --> 03:43.641
but to be fair, I-I usually
took a nap before looking.

03:46.310 --> 03:48.020
I got some rest,
and he felt

03:48.020 --> 03:49.271
like a champion hider.

03:49.271 --> 03:50.981
Win-win.

03:50.981 --> 03:53.692
Here.

03:53.692 --> 03:55.361
What?

03:55.361 --> 03:58.280
Wyatt, I just bought
this shirt for you.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.198
What happened?

03:59.198 --> 04:01.033
Who cares what happened?

04:01.033 --> 04:02.618
It's just a stupid shirt.

04:02.618 --> 04:04.161
Hey, don't talk to me
like that, young man.

04:04.161 --> 04:06.372
Great, no matter what I say,
it's gonna be wrong.

04:06.372 --> 04:08.916
So maybe I shouldn't
say anything at all.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.209
Wha...are you serious?

04:14.338 --> 04:15.464
Okay.

04:16.882 --> 04:18.050
If you want it that way...

04:21.053 --> 04:22.179
Here.

04:31.146 --> 04:32.690
What just happened?

04:32.690 --> 04:34.483
- Maybe I can help a little.
-

04:34.483 --> 04:36.443
You think I should
talk to him or...

04:36.443 --> 04:38.362
- wait until...
- Oh, oh, no.

04:38.362 --> 04:40.364
I'm not dancing through
that field of cow patties.

04:40.364 --> 04:42.992
No, I meant, uh,
maybe I could call the gym

04:42.992 --> 04:45.452
and figure out
how to get a refund.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.412
You know what?
I'll take it.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.581
Are you kidding me?

04:49.581 --> 04:51.792
Who ordered
Cage Fighting Championships

04:51.792 --> 04:53.293
on pay-per-view?

04:53.293 --> 04:55.129
Oh, those darn kids, right?

04:55.129 --> 04:56.171
You know,
I'm gonna go

04:56.171 --> 04:57.965
fix that gym thing right now.

05:01.385 --> 05:03.554
Hey, Uncle Terry.
What's up?

05:03.554 --> 05:05.055
Uh, just losing
at solitaire, which,

05:05.055 --> 05:06.515
technically, must mean
I'm also winning,

05:06.515 --> 05:08.726
'cause I'm beating myself.

05:08.726 --> 05:09.893
I was just wondering if

05:09.893 --> 05:12.396
you wanted to play
some football.

05:12.396 --> 05:14.356
What, are you kidding me?
I've been waiting here for weeks

05:14.356 --> 05:16.775
for one of you squirts to wanna
do something with old Uncle T.

05:16.775 --> 05:18.485
Yeah, well,
Liam and Wyatt don't want to,

05:18.485 --> 05:20.112
and all of my friends
are busy, so...

05:20.112 --> 05:21.822
No need to beg.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.157
I'd love to toss around
the old pigskin with you.

05:23.157 --> 05:24.450
Just let me slip out
of these flip-flops

05:24.450 --> 05:25.868
and into my sport Crocs.

05:25.868 --> 05:28.037
Uh, you...you can stay
in your flip-flops.

05:28.037 --> 05:30.873
I meant video football.

05:33.625 --> 05:36.253
uh, I'm not much
of a, uh, video gamer.

05:36.253 --> 05:39.173
Uh, the last one I played
wasMs. Pac-Manat my old job.

05:39.173 --> 05:41.759
But...wait, you had a job?

05:41.759 --> 05:44.053
Are you kidding?
I've had hundreds of them.

05:44.053 --> 05:46.055
How do you feel
about cold hot wings?

05:46.055 --> 05:48.557
I feel angry that they're
not already in my mouth.

05:52.394 --> 05:54.146
I'm having the worst day ever.

05:54.146 --> 05:56.190
I just got in a fight
with Mom...

05:56.190 --> 05:58.692
I don't have time
for your childish problems.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.110
The skateboard I'm making
doesn't look

06:00.110 --> 06:01.904
remotely skateboard-y.

06:01.904 --> 06:04.531
It kind of looks like
it might be a skateboard.

06:04.531 --> 06:05.866
Someday.

06:05.866 --> 06:06.909
Well,
someday better be Friday,

06:06.909 --> 06:08.243
or I'm getting an F in shop.

06:08.243 --> 06:10.162
Why should I even have
to do this?

06:10.162 --> 06:12.081
Working with my hands
is not my destiny.

06:12.081 --> 06:14.541
This hand is for signing checks.

06:14.541 --> 06:17.002
And this hand
is for cashing them.

06:17.002 --> 06:19.421
Okay, but seriously, about Mom.
What should I...

06:19.421 --> 06:21.590
See, Wyatt,
this is your problem.

06:21.590 --> 06:24.009
You have no empathy
for other people's feelings.

06:24.009 --> 06:25.719
It's really pretty sad.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.763
By the way,
I heard you epically flamed out

06:27.763 --> 06:29.264
at school trying
to talk to a girl.

06:29.264 --> 06:30.933
Smooth move.

06:30.933 --> 06:32.643
You heard about that?

06:32.643 --> 06:34.144
Dude, everyone has.

06:34.144 --> 06:36.980
I've already downloaded
two GIFs of it.

06:36.980 --> 06:38.857
Take a little advice
from someone older

06:38.857 --> 06:40.818
and more sophisticated than you.

06:40.818 --> 06:44.446
All girls really care about
is what's in here.

06:44.446 --> 06:45.447
My heart?

06:45.447 --> 06:47.032
No, you dork.

06:47.032 --> 06:48.617
That's where you keep
your slim-line wallet

06:48.617 --> 06:50.577
when you wear a $3,000 suit.

06:50.577 --> 06:53.622
career comes first.

06:53.622 --> 06:55.332
You have to make
at least $2 million

06:55.332 --> 06:57.334
so if you get divorced,
you're still a millionaire.

06:57.334 --> 06:58.585
Got it?

06:58.585 --> 06:59.962
Not...really.

07:03.507 --> 07:05.342
it's impossible
to communicate with women,

07:05.342 --> 07:06.760
so why bother trying?

07:30.534 --> 07:32.369
Welcome aboard,
bubblehead.

07:32.369 --> 07:35.080
That's submarine-speak
for "howdy, sailor."

07:35.080 --> 07:36.874
What's that noise?

07:36.874 --> 07:39.251
It sounds like Uncle Terry
when he tries to beatbox.

07:39.251 --> 07:41.336
That, son, would be Morse code.

07:41.336 --> 07:43.255
It's kind of like
old-fashioned texting,

07:43.255 --> 07:46.383
- only without the emojis.
- No emojis?

07:46.383 --> 07:48.218
How are you supposed
to send a smiley face?

07:49.553 --> 07:53.348
Uh, dot-dot-dot, dot, dash,
dot, dot, dash, d...

07:53.348 --> 07:55.434
well, yeah, that would really
take a long time, actually.

07:55.434 --> 07:56.894
- - I understand that

07:56.894 --> 07:59.688
about as well as I understand
talking to Maya.

07:59.688 --> 08:02.232
Ah, talking with a girl.

08:02.232 --> 08:03.942
The noblest form
of communication.

08:03.942 --> 08:06.236
Not when you have
no idea what to say.

08:06.236 --> 08:07.863
Well, communication
isn't always easy.

08:07.863 --> 08:09.489
But there's always a way.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.866
Look at us.

08:10.866 --> 08:13.076
500 feet below
the ocean's surface

08:13.076 --> 08:15.078
and we can still talk to people.

08:15.078 --> 08:17.623
- It is pretty cool.
-

08:17.623 --> 08:19.875
The enemy's approaching!
Man your station, sailor.

08:21.919 --> 08:23.003
We've gotta make our move.

08:24.588 --> 08:27.299
- - D-seven.

08:30.761 --> 08:32.136
Hit!

08:32.136 --> 08:33.554
You sank my battleship.

08:33.554 --> 08:36.350
Yes! All right.

08:36.350 --> 08:37.683
Incidentally, did you know

08:37.683 --> 08:39.144
the fist bump was invented
on submarines

08:39.144 --> 08:40.854
'cause the ceilings
are too low to high-five?

08:40.854 --> 08:43.148
That's great, Dad, but...

08:43.148 --> 08:45.817
how does that help me know
how to talk to Maya?

08:45.817 --> 08:47.778
It doesn't.
But the book does.

08:49.363 --> 08:51.698
Everything you need to know
is in that book.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.116
Take a look.

08:53.116 --> 08:55.244
Aye, aye, Captain!

08:55.244 --> 08:57.788
"Captain."
I like that.

08:57.788 --> 08:59.623
You can call me Captain.

08:59.623 --> 09:01.708
Or "my liege."

09:01.708 --> 09:04.461
Whichever comes more naturally.

09:09.549 --> 09:12.678
What?
"Sun."

09:12.678 --> 09:14.096
That's it?

09:15.347 --> 09:17.641
How is that
everything I need to know?

09:17.641 --> 09:19.935
Strikers really need...

09:19.935 --> 09:21.270
Heads up, I'm going
to the end zone!

09:21.270 --> 09:22.729
Oh, yeah?
That's what you think,

09:22.729 --> 09:24.523
'cause I'm gonna...
hang on, which...

09:24.523 --> 09:26.608
which button is the "run"

09:26.608 --> 09:28.485
And which...hang on,
which one is my guy again?

09:28.485 --> 09:29.987
You're the guy over there
running in circles

09:29.987 --> 09:31.405
next to the cheerleaders.

09:31.405 --> 09:34.408
Aw, yeah,
Video Terry's got game.

09:34.408 --> 09:36.743
Uh, excuse me, ladies,
I can't chat right now.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.036
I've gotta X, O...

09:38.036 --> 09:39.830
Touchdown!

09:41.290 --> 09:42.416
Boom!

09:42.416 --> 09:44.084
Dude, nice move!

09:44.084 --> 09:46.086
Hey, and...and second place,
not so bad either.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.672
That is a silver medal
in the Olympics.

09:48.672 --> 09:50.465
Hanging with you is so fun,
Uncle Terry.

09:50.465 --> 09:52.259
You know, what do you say
we do a rematch?

09:52.259 --> 09:55.595
Well, I can't feel my thumbs
from scoring on you so much,

09:55.595 --> 09:57.764
so maybe this time
won't be a total domination.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.891
Wait a minute...

10:04.271 --> 10:06.231
That'll help.

10:10.402 --> 10:12.279
Hey, that's
an interesting outfit.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.489
- You going to a bullfight?
- Close.

10:14.489 --> 10:16.450
I'm going flamenco
dancing tonight.

10:16.450 --> 10:19.494
when in Andalusia...

10:19.494 --> 10:21.455
No, nobody says that.

10:21.455 --> 10:23.248
Um, hey, have you talked
to Wyatt?

10:23.248 --> 10:25.459
He hasn't said
a word to me all day.

10:25.459 --> 10:27.669
Don't complain.
Terry talked to me

10:27.669 --> 10:29.171
for half an hour straight
this morning,

10:29.171 --> 10:30.922
and that was through
the bathroom door.

10:30.922 --> 10:32.299
Okay, never mind.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.301
Um, oh, what about
the gym thing?

10:34.301 --> 10:35.802
Did you get that
straightened out?

10:35.802 --> 10:37.637
Yep, went down there
and took care of everything.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.806
That crappy membership
is a thing of the past.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.308
Oh, thank God.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.810
I got us upgraded
to the premium membership

10:43.810 --> 10:47.773
with full pool
and sauna privileges.

10:47.773 --> 10:49.900
Hmm.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.943
Oh, shoot.

10:51.943 --> 10:54.696
I got up-sold, didn't I?
I...

10:54.696 --> 10:56.239
In my defense,

10:56.239 --> 10:58.033
Jean-Claude at the front desk

10:58.033 --> 11:00.952
is one silver-tongued Adonis.

11:00.952 --> 11:02.996
It was one simple thing,
Tiffany,

11:02.996 --> 11:05.290
that you volunteered
to do for me.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.876
Well, I guess we both
learned our lesson, didn't we?

11:16.927 --> 11:19.179
- Hey.
- Hey, Wyatt.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.680
How's it going, tiger?

11:20.680 --> 11:23.850
Uh, uh...good.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.978
Great, uh...
everything's...great.

11:36.571 --> 11:40.158
Tiffany...can I ask you
for some advice?

11:41.910 --> 11:43.703
Only if you want
an awesome answer.

11:43.703 --> 11:44.996
I do.

11:44.996 --> 11:46.415
There's this girl in my class

11:46.415 --> 11:49.042
that I really like, but...

11:49.042 --> 11:50.377
I don't know
what to do about it.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.379
Oh, honey.

11:52.379 --> 11:56.466
You're sweet and sensitive
and cute as a button.

11:56.466 --> 11:57.926
But I'm not gonna lie to you.

11:57.926 --> 12:00.804
If you want any shot
with the ladies,

12:00.804 --> 12:02.639
you gotta be in a rock band.

12:02.639 --> 12:05.600
Lead singer, guitarist,
drummer, it...

12:05.600 --> 12:08.103
pretty much anything
except the keyboard player.

12:08.103 --> 12:10.689
They always put
the nerd on keys.

12:10.689 --> 12:12.816
Okay.

12:12.816 --> 12:15.318
- Thanks.
- Just remember, Wyatt,

12:15.318 --> 12:18.238
you can't always
get what you want.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.407
But if you try sometimes,

12:20.407 --> 12:22.451
you just might find...

12:22.451 --> 12:24.077
you get what you need.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.001
How long do you think
it would take me

12:31.001 --> 12:32.544
to learn
a musical instrument?

12:32.544 --> 12:34.254
Tiffany said it's my only shot.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.549
Well, I've taken oboe lessons
since I was six.

12:37.549 --> 12:39.468
Can you play
any cool rock songs?

12:39.468 --> 12:42.345
I can play the tune that makes
a cobra come out of a basket.

12:42.345 --> 12:43.972
My little sister
thinks it's cool,

12:43.972 --> 12:46.558
but she also thinks
balloon unicorns are cool.

12:46.558 --> 12:48.935
She calls them "balloon-icorns."

12:48.935 --> 12:50.854
Your sister sounds kind of...

12:50.854 --> 12:53.315
Hey, what time is band practice?

12:53.315 --> 12:54.900
You know, for our band?

12:54.900 --> 12:57.569
Well...I could do any time,

12:57.569 --> 12:59.029
00.

12:59.029 --> 13:01.573
- There is no band, Sam.
- Fine.

13:01.573 --> 13:03.158
30,

13:03.158 --> 13:04.743
but you'll have
to talk to my mom.

13:07.412 --> 13:08.914
There's the offense going right,

13:08.914 --> 13:10.207
but the defense...

13:10.207 --> 13:11.708
Hey, little buddy!

13:11.708 --> 13:13.251
Game's all set
and ready to rock.

13:13.251 --> 13:14.836
I have been practicing all day

13:14.836 --> 13:17.255
and listening to Jock Jams...
so I'm pumped.

13:17.255 --> 13:18.673
No, thanks, Uncle Terry.

13:18.673 --> 13:20.467
That game's gotten
kind of boring.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.177
The new version is way better.

13:22.177 --> 13:23.845
When you sack the quarterback,

13:23.845 --> 13:25.263
you can actually
rip out his spine

13:25.263 --> 13:27.224
and dance around with it.

13:27.224 --> 13:28.767
I do like to dance.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.352
Yeah, it's pretty sweet,

13:30.352 --> 13:31.853
except it's 60 bucks.

13:31.853 --> 13:34.523
60 bucks?

13:34.523 --> 13:36.107
That's a bargain!
Where else are you gonna

13:36.107 --> 13:37.692
be able to rip out
somebody's spine

13:37.692 --> 13:39.152
and dance around with it
for that kind of money?

13:39.152 --> 13:40.862
That's exactly what I said!

13:40.862 --> 13:42.906
Okay, you know what?
The parking tickets can wait.

13:42.906 --> 13:44.449
I am buying us that game!

13:44.449 --> 13:46.034
- Awesome!
- Yeah!

13:46.034 --> 13:48.203
Okay, wait.
Ah, let's try that again.

13:48.203 --> 13:51.373
Bring it in slow.
I'm gonna practice that too.

13:56.586 --> 13:58.713
Broke a heel last night.

13:58.713 --> 14:02.384
Apparently flamenco and sangria
are bad dance partners.

14:02.384 --> 14:04.803
This whole assignment
is idiotic!

14:10.183 --> 14:12.060
Need a little help?

14:12.060 --> 14:13.770
Did Bill Gates need help
from his grandmother

14:13.770 --> 14:15.355
when he built his empire?

14:15.355 --> 14:16.648
No clue.
I'm a Mac gal.

14:16.648 --> 14:19.693
I wish Dad were here.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.486
He'd understand.

14:21.486 --> 14:24.489
I know, honey.

14:24.489 --> 14:25.574
I know.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.872
We all miss him.

14:36.126 --> 14:39.379
And where do you think
he learned to build stuff, huh?

14:39.379 --> 14:40.755
Scooch on over, John-Boy.

14:48.263 --> 14:50.599
From stilettos to kitten heels.

14:52.726 --> 14:55.520
How the heck did you...

14:55.520 --> 14:57.230
You know what?

14:57.230 --> 14:58.773
If it means that much to you
to help me,

14:58.773 --> 15:01.026
then it'd be selfish of me
not to let you.

15:01.026 --> 15:03.445
If you're asking
for my help, honey...

15:03.445 --> 15:05.363
you gotta do it the right way.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.200
Fine.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.785
Tiffany...

15:13.580 --> 15:14.873
...would you please help me?

15:14.873 --> 15:15.915
Sure.

15:17.500 --> 15:20.378
But as your buddy Bill Gates
would probably say,

15:20.378 --> 15:22.839
it's gonna cost you.

15:22.839 --> 15:26.718
And, uh...let's keep this
our secret.

15:26.718 --> 15:28.553
Last thing I need
is for people around here

15:28.553 --> 15:30.055
to know I can do stuff.

15:33.183 --> 15:35.435
Okay, let's do that.

15:35.435 --> 15:38.063
Hi, I'm here to cancel
a gym membership.

15:38.063 --> 15:40.231
You must be Jean-Claude.

15:40.231 --> 15:42.400
Yes, uh, and your name is?

15:42.400 --> 15:43.902
Don't bother, okay?

15:43.902 --> 15:45.487
Because I'm not gonna fall
for your sweet talk,

15:45.487 --> 15:48.198
and I won't be up-sold,
and I'm not gonna be tricked

15:48.198 --> 15:52.327
into any "special deals," okay?
I'm here to cancel a membership

15:52.327 --> 15:53.703
and that's it.
Got it?

15:53.703 --> 15:56.414
Yes, no problem.

15:56.414 --> 15:58.458
See, no...see, no,
no, no, no.

15:58.458 --> 16:03.755
No, no, 'cause I am not falling
for whatever...you're doing.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.008
What are you doing?

16:07.008 --> 16:09.177
Uh, the name of the membership
you want to cancel?

16:09.177 --> 16:11.054
Patrick McKenna.

16:11.054 --> 16:13.348
Okay, and don't tell me
that it's un-refundable

16:13.348 --> 16:15.100
or talk me into transferring...

16:15.100 --> 16:16.768
You're Patrick's wife.

16:16.768 --> 16:19.020
- Uh...
- I'm so sorry.

16:19.020 --> 16:21.147
He was a wonderful man.

16:21.147 --> 16:23.274
Wait, you-you knew him?

16:23.274 --> 16:25.568
So he...he was coming here?

16:25.568 --> 16:28.196
He was training here
for almost a year.

16:28.196 --> 16:30.990
It was supposed
to be a surprise.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.909
A surprise for who?

16:32.909 --> 16:34.202
For you.

16:35.787 --> 16:39.749
He wanted to be able to run
a half marathon with you.

16:39.749 --> 16:42.252
He told me how much
you loved to run and...

16:42.252 --> 16:45.630
he wanted to be a part
of something that you loved.

16:45.630 --> 16:47.716
And then he...

16:50.260 --> 16:51.469
And then he got sick.

16:53.179 --> 16:57.100
Yeah, I haven't run since then.

16:57.100 --> 17:00.687
I'll, uh...I'll cancel
his account right now.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.939
Thank you for...for being
so understanding.

17:04.858 --> 17:08.361
And I'm...you know, I'm really
sorry that I misjudged you.

17:08.361 --> 17:11.281
It is, uh...
how you say, uh...

17:11.281 --> 17:13.031
no big deal.

17:13.031 --> 17:14.909
Thank you.

17:14.909 --> 17:16.118
Okay.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.290
Dude.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.791
Why'd I let her off the hook?

17:22.791 --> 17:25.002
I'm this close to that Jet Ski.

17:32.135 --> 17:33.720
Hey, Uncle Terry.
Thanks for the new game.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.430
It is awesome!

17:35.430 --> 17:37.182
...the 40-yard line!

17:37.182 --> 17:38.975
He's not gonna get up
anytime soon.

17:38.975 --> 17:40.769
Oh, yeah.

17:41.853 --> 17:44.189
Hey, I-I kinda thought the two
of us, you know, were gonna...

17:44.189 --> 17:46.483
It even has a decapitation mode

17:46.483 --> 17:48.234
that if you hit the quarterback
hard enough,

17:48.234 --> 17:50.069
its head flies off,
and you can kick it

17:50.069 --> 17:51.196
into the stands!

17:51.196 --> 17:54.532
See?
Boom! Yeah!

17:54.532 --> 17:56.826
- There goes your head!
- That should be my head.

18:07.629 --> 18:10.465
It doesn't make any sense.

18:14.719 --> 18:16.179
Wait.

18:23.812 --> 18:26.648
"Just be yourself, son."

18:32.654 --> 18:34.280
Welcome back, submariner.

18:34.280 --> 18:35.782
I've been waiting for you.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.367
I cracked your code, Dad.

18:37.367 --> 18:40.703
But all it said was
"just be yourself."

18:40.703 --> 18:43.414
There's no way
that would ever work.

18:43.414 --> 18:45.208
Communication can be
challenging, Wyatt.

18:45.208 --> 18:46.960
Sometimes it's hard work.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.670
That's why I used
the invisible ink--

18:48.670 --> 18:50.088
to make you dig
a little deeper.

18:50.088 --> 18:52.257
But I did work hard.

18:52.257 --> 18:54.384
Now I think it's too late.

18:54.384 --> 18:57.011
I totally humiliated myself
in front of Maya

18:57.011 --> 19:00.139
because I listened to what
everyone else was saying.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.724
It's never too late, son,

19:01.724 --> 19:03.268
as long as you're honest
and you're open

19:03.268 --> 19:05.395
and you share what's
really in your heart.

19:05.395 --> 19:06.980
What if I don't know
what that is?

19:06.980 --> 19:08.982
Hey, look, I'm good,
but for the really tricky stuff,

19:08.982 --> 19:11.067
you gotta talk to the master.

19:11.067 --> 19:12.735
Down, periscope!

19:15.113 --> 19:17.282
Pretty cool, huh?
Take a look.

19:25.081 --> 19:26.541
Mom?

19:26.541 --> 19:28.626
You know anyone
with a bigger heart than hers?

19:28.626 --> 19:29.627
I sure don't.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.096
What do you think

19:40.096 --> 19:42.056
Yell "up, periscope."

19:42.056 --> 19:44.225
I'd love to, but I kind of

19:44.225 --> 19:45.977
have something
really important I have to do.

19:48.855 --> 19:51.065
Aw, what the heck?
Up, periscope!

19:52.901 --> 19:54.319
Never gets old.

20:14.505 --> 20:16.966
I'm sorry
for yelling at you, Mom.

20:16.966 --> 20:21.846
I was having a terrible day
and I took it out on you.

20:21.846 --> 20:24.599
And then I got stuck being mad,

20:24.599 --> 20:26.809
even when I didn't
wanna be anymore.

20:26.809 --> 20:28.186
Sweetheart.

20:29.812 --> 20:31.481
I'm sorry too.

20:31.481 --> 20:32.982
Okay?
It was a silly shirt.

20:32.982 --> 20:34.776
And I was caught up
in my own nonsense

20:34.776 --> 20:37.362
and I should not have
let it go on like that.

20:37.362 --> 20:39.197
So...friends again?

20:39.197 --> 20:42.033
Wyatt, we'll always be friends.

20:42.033 --> 20:43.868
Let's make a deal, okay?

20:43.868 --> 20:45.787
Next time we feel like
not talking to each other,

20:45.787 --> 20:47.205
let's...

20:47.205 --> 20:49.874
...let's definitely
talk about that.

20:49.874 --> 20:51.250
Okay.
Deal.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.465
You're going jogging?

20:57.465 --> 20:59.133
You haven't done that
in a long time.

20:59.133 --> 21:00.969
I know.
And it's gonna be great

21:00.969 --> 21:03.513
to get out there again.
It'll be good for me...

21:03.513 --> 21:05.014
in a lot of ways.

21:05.014 --> 21:07.308
Uh, cool.
Now that we're talking again

21:07.308 --> 21:08.518
and you're, like,

21:08.518 --> 21:09.686
the smartest person
that I know...

21:09.686 --> 21:10.895
Agreed, mm-hmm.

21:10.895 --> 21:12.563
...I need some advice.

21:12.563 --> 21:14.482
Okay.

21:14.482 --> 21:17.151
There's this girl...

21:17.151 --> 21:19.445
that I kind of like.

21:19.445 --> 21:20.571
Mm-hmm.

21:20.571 --> 21:22.615
And I'm still not sure

21:22.615 --> 21:24.575
what to say to her.

21:24.575 --> 21:27.996
Okay.
Um...well...

21:27.996 --> 21:31.457
I still remember the first words
your father said to me.

21:31.457 --> 21:33.042
Really?

21:33.042 --> 21:34.836
What were they?

21:34.836 --> 21:36.337
I was a freshman.

21:36.337 --> 21:39.007
And I was checking out
all the cool stuff

21:39.007 --> 21:41.134
at an engineering fair on campus

21:41.134 --> 21:45.138
when up walks this super cute
and kind of awkward fella.

21:45.138 --> 21:47.265
And he looks me in the eyes

21:47.265 --> 21:49.642
and he says,
"Hey, miss.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.310
You ever arm-wrestled a robot?"

21:53.062 --> 21:55.231
And that was it.
I was hooked.

21:55.231 --> 21:58.943
That's great, Mom, but...
I can't say that.

21:58.943 --> 22:01.696
No, of course not, silly.
That line is pure Patrick.

22:01.696 --> 22:04.615
See, you...you have
to show her pure Wyatt.

22:04.615 --> 22:06.451
And it's really not
that big of a deal.

22:06.451 --> 22:10.496
You just talk to her about
what interests you these days.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.331
Okay.

22:12.331 --> 22:13.332
Thanks, Mom.

22:14.751 --> 22:17.336
So...did you beat the robot?

22:17.336 --> 22:18.463
What do you think?

22:18.463 --> 22:20.798
Look at these guns!

22:20.798 --> 22:23.092
These will not be defeated.

22:23.092 --> 22:25.094
I'll take that as a yes.

22:29.307 --> 22:30.767
Hey, Maya.

22:30.767 --> 22:33.144
Wanna learn how to say
your name in Morse code?

22:33.144 --> 22:35.313
Uh...not really.

22:35.313 --> 22:36.856
No, no, no, it's...it's cool,

22:36.856 --> 22:38.733
'cause it's actually
pretty easy.

22:38.733 --> 22:43.863
It's just...dash-dash...
dot-dash...

22:43.863 --> 22:45.198
No, no, I have to hit it harder.

22:45.198 --> 22:48.659
Dash-dash,
dot-dash, dash...

22:48.659 --> 22:51.370
It's...it all starts with D,
so, uh, dash, dot...

22:51.370 --> 22:52.538
uh, no, no, no.
Dosh, dat...

22:52.538 --> 22:55.166
You're, like...super weird.

22:59.378 --> 23:00.880
Dot-dot-dot-dot,

23:00.880 --> 23:03.382
dot-dot.

23:03.382 --> 23:06.636
- What?
- That's Morse code for "hi."

23:06.636 --> 23:08.513
My grandpa taught me that.
He was in the navy.

23:08.513 --> 23:10.932
Oh.
My dad was the captain

23:10.932 --> 23:14.185
of a submarine... ...kind of.

23:14.185 --> 23:15.353
That's really cool, Wyatt.

23:18.523 --> 23:20.983
You...know my name?

23:20.983 --> 23:22.902
Yeah, I do.
I'm Natalie.

23:24.821 --> 23:27.281
See you around.

23:27.281 --> 23:29.075
Wow.

23:33.621 --> 23:35.414
Of course.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.083
Everyone sees me
rip my shirt off,

23:37.083 --> 23:41.003
but no one sees that.

23:48.261 --> 23:49.137
Mm.

23:49.137 --> 23:50.847
Oh, hey, hey, hey.

23:50.847 --> 23:52.390
Go easy on piggy number seven.

23:52.390 --> 23:53.724
She's more ticklish
than the rest.

23:53.724 --> 23:56.018
Just get in there
with your hands.

23:56.018 --> 23:57.687
I'm starting to think
that an F wouldn't be so bad.

24:05.069 --> 24:06.654
Hi.

24:06.654 --> 24:08.531
- Is Liam being punished?
-

24:08.531 --> 24:11.826
I'm not sure, but it's nice
to see them bonding...

24:11.826 --> 24:14.328
and buffing.
So?

24:14.328 --> 24:16.164
How'd it go with the girl?

24:16.164 --> 24:18.332
- Hmm?
- Horrible.

24:20.459 --> 24:23.004
But then pretty awesome.

24:23.004 --> 24:25.756
What?
Hold it, mister, I want details!

24:25.756 --> 24:27.675
Remember?
We agreed to talk!

24:31.012 --> 24:32.847
- - Enter.

24:36.517 --> 24:38.311
Oh.
It's you.

24:38.311 --> 24:40.563
Wanna play some football?

24:40.563 --> 24:41.689
Oh, no, thanks.

24:41.689 --> 24:43.107
I'm in a meeting.

24:43.107 --> 24:44.817
Are you sure?

24:44.817 --> 24:46.611
You said you liked
the real thing.

24:49.363 --> 24:50.656
Look...

24:50.656 --> 24:53.201
so I'm really, uh...

24:53.201 --> 24:55.286
I'm, uh...you know...

24:57.038 --> 24:58.664
Uncle Terry.

24:58.664 --> 25:00.583
I'd rather rip off
your quarterback's head

25:00.583 --> 25:02.168
than anyone else's.

25:04.337 --> 25:06.088
You're not just saying that
to make me feel better?

25:06.088 --> 25:08.090
No way.

25:08.090 --> 25:10.051
Wow.

25:10.051 --> 25:12.595
That's the sweetest apology
I ever almost got.

25:12.595 --> 25:15.348
- So you'll play

25:15.348 --> 25:17.141
Get ready to have
your head ripped off

25:17.141 --> 25:18.851
by one of my bullet spirals!

25:18.851 --> 25:20.686
Hang on.

25:20.686 --> 25:22.772
Super cold hot wing
for the road?

25:22.772 --> 25:24.690
Best uncle ever!

25:24.690 --> 25:26.192
Duh!

25:30.154 --> 25:31.948
All right, Uncle Terry,
let's see what you got.

25:31.948 --> 25:35.117
Brace yourself for the beauty,
little man.

25:35.117 --> 25:37.286
Come on, you gotta dive!

25:37.286 --> 25:39.288
You gotta dive for those.
Not gonna walk to you.

25:39.288 --> 25:40.873
Okay, that one got away
from me a little bit.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.250
- Little bit, little bit.
- Ball is probably wet

25:42.250 --> 25:44.168
or something, you know?

25:46.545 --> 25:48.756
Comin' in hot.

25:48.756 --> 25:50.549
All right, toss me another one.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.134
We'll stay out here
until you get the hang of it.

25:54.262 --> 25:56.180
Mom, looking good.

25:56.180 --> 25:57.765
Aw, thank you.
Yeah, I forgot

25:57.765 --> 25:59.934
how much running relaxes me.

25:59.934 --> 26:02.478
All right.

26:04.730 --> 26:07.733
Yep. Nothing more soothing
than a good jog.

26:07.733 --> 26:10.486
Hey, Beth.
Hey, Beth. B...

26:10.486 --> 26:13.197
All right, Dash.
Let's face the mus...

26:13.197 --> 26:14.156
Dash?

26:14.156 --> 26:15.116
Hey!

26:15.116 --> 26:16.575
Who broke my window?

26:17.305 --> 26:23.868
