00:11.930 --> 00:14.730
So, according to the statement
you gave the police,

00:14.750 --> 00:17.090
you came home from work
and she was just...

00:19.010 --> 00:20.360
Your wife, I mean.

00:21.720 --> 00:24.280
She was just there like that?

00:25.390 --> 00:26.250
Yeah.

00:29.040 --> 00:31.140
I got off at 5 : 20,

00:31.960 --> 00:33.060
drove home.

00:33.940 --> 00:35.240
Stopped for gas.

00:37.317 --> 00:39.280
It was winter, you know ? So...

00:40.412 --> 00:43.011
by the time I pulled into the driveway,
it was dark.

00:45.590 --> 00:46.944
That was the thing.

00:48.003 --> 00:50.279
I walked into the house
and the house was dark.

00:50.869 --> 00:53.063
I mean, our house, never dark.

00:54.497 --> 00:56.791
She was always turning lights on.

00:57.176 --> 00:58.971
I was always shutting 'em off.

01:02.526 --> 01:04.650
Took my eyes a minute to adjust.

01:06.436 --> 01:07.500
Even then...

01:08.967 --> 01:10.363
I was just, like...

01:12.117 --> 01:13.430
I saw a shape...

01:15.418 --> 01:16.631
on the floor.

01:17.866 --> 01:19.200
This, like, mound.

01:19.427 --> 01:21.721
I thought maybe she had rolled a rug up.

01:24.388 --> 01:26.832
And I got closer and I realized it was her.

01:27.377 --> 01:28.791
It was my wife.

01:32.627 --> 01:34.140
And I couldn't figure out

01:34.265 --> 01:35.660
what she was doing there...

01:35.825 --> 01:38.921
on the floor on her side.

01:40.835 --> 01:42.383
I said something to her,

01:43.445 --> 01:45.543
but she didn't say nothing back.

01:46.407 --> 01:47.522
Didn't move.

01:48.675 --> 01:49.522
Nothing.

01:51.738 --> 01:54.682
Then I turned the light on, 
and I saw all the blood.

01:55.755 --> 01:57.551
I was standing in it, actually.

01:59.037 --> 02:01.733
I was standing in her blood
and I didn't even know it.

02:02.037 --> 02:04.150
I'm sorry to make you...

02:04.376 --> 02:05.711
to remind you.

02:06.136 --> 02:07.132
I'm sorry.

02:07.375 --> 02:08.520
It's okay.

02:10.636 --> 02:12.150
You're nice to say that.

02:16.166 --> 02:17.962
Your skin is so white.

02:23.586 --> 02:28.200
If I took my blade and ran it from the... 
bottom of your neck to the top of your crotch,

02:29.397 --> 02:31.692
the way the blood would slowly...

02:31.906 --> 02:34.800
...seep out and cover your white skin...

02:36.998 --> 02:38.390
Be quite a sight.

02:41.858 --> 02:43.122
What's going on ?

02:44.755 --> 02:45.870
You okay ?

02:46.806 --> 02:47.000
Yeah.

02:47.005 --> 02:48.832
Bob, back to you.

02:48.838 --> 02:50.311
No. it was...

02:50.676 --> 02:52.301
just a dream, I guess.

02:53.407 --> 02:54.561
Was I in it ?

02:55.508 --> 02:56.880
Were we naked ?

02:57.407 --> 02:59.471
Answer the second question first.

02:59.685 --> 03:01.602
You sure you're okay ?

03:05.215 --> 03:07.011
I said, "I'm okay".

03:07.948 --> 03:08.980
Okay.

03:09.196 --> 03:10.572
Okay.

03:58.988 --> 04:01.282
{\a6}It was shortly after 6 yesterday evening

04:01.366 --> 04:03.940
{\a6}when her parents reported three-year-old Davina missing,

04:04.076 --> 04:06.092
{\a6}apparently abducted while on a shopping trip

04:06.158 --> 04:08.563
{\a6}with her family at the Greysmark Shopping Center.

04:08.568 --> 04:08.862
Will you change the channel?

04:08.868 --> 04:11.592
{\a6}Investigators are anxious to speak to Lloyd Isaacson,

04:11.765 --> 04:13.401
{\a6}a security guard on duty yesterday,

04:13.408 --> 04:13.912
Joe !

04:13.915 --> 04:14.631
{\a6}who apparently left his post

04:14.636 --> 04:15.530
Change the channel.

04:15.538 --> 04:15.891
{\a6}and did not clock out.

04:15.898 --> 04:17.962
The kids are watching.
My hands are full.

04:18.087 --> 04:19.652
{\a6}Calls to the Issacson residence...

04:19.654 --> 04:20.101
{\a6}...Mr. Isaacson has any prior history as a sex offender.

04:20.108 --> 04:21.401
Joe, are you deaf ?

04:21.527 --> 04:22.800
Change the channel.

04:28.837 --> 04:31.551
{\a6}...ingredients chosen to create the perfect little girls...

04:31.556 --> 04:33.232
Powerpuff Girls !

04:33.236 --> 04:36.452
{\a6}...accidentally added an extra ingredient to the concoction

04:36.817 --> 04:37.913
{\a6}Chemical X...

04:37.998 --> 04:40.143
So last night's feature attraction

04:40.175 --> 04:41.921
My Dinner with Mr. Ginsu?

04:42.157 --> 04:43.981
Do you have any idea
where this strange encounter took place ?

04:43.986 --> 04:45.953
{\a6}...using their ultra super powers,

04:46.038 --> 04:46.740
{\a6}Blossom,

04:46.775 --> 04:47.433
{\a6}Bubbles,

04:47.455 --> 04:48.861
{\a6}and Buttercup have...

04:52.777 --> 04:54.752
There was a sign
on the wall behind him.

04:56.276 --> 04:58.520
It happened near here, Phoenix.

04:58.525 --> 04:59.890
Somewhere in Phoenix.

05:56.496 --> 05:57.740
Lights,  please.

06:02.335 --> 06:04.653
This is the front door to Pablo's house.

06:06.066 --> 06:09.362
Here's the detail of where
Martinez shot the lock on the front door

06:09.487 --> 06:11.713
to gain entry and commit the homicides.

06:14.018 --> 06:17.570
Here's the bedroom where Martinez found Pablo
and began the interrogation

06:17.705 --> 06:22.433
in an effort to recover the $30,000 from a drug deal
that Pablo never gave him.

06:24.678 --> 06:27.943
Here's a slug of the mattress from the first time
he shot Pablo; the leg wound.

06:27.955 --> 06:29.751
Whoa. Back up a second.

06:29.987 --> 06:32.460
The accused fired seven shots into Pablo.

06:32.468 --> 06:35.450
How do you know which was first or second
or seventh for that matter?

06:35.456 --> 06:38.900
Even the crime lab can't tell us
which shot came first.

06:39.246 --> 06:40.600
No. You're right.

06:40.635 --> 06:42.711
It's just... a theory, I guess.

06:43.735 --> 06:44.711
A theory?

06:45.428 --> 06:47.310
Guy gets shot seven times.

06:47.427 --> 06:49.041
The leg wound's the least consequential.

06:49.057 --> 06:52.852
I guess I'm figuring he started with that 'cause he knew
it would cause a lot of pain, but wouldn't kill him.

06:52.867 --> 06:54.840
It's a good way to find out
where your money is.

06:54.857 --> 06:56.101
And then what?

06:56.265 --> 06:57.923
Pablo tells him where to find the cash,

06:57.966 --> 07:01.660
and to show his appreciation, Martinez shoots him
six more times through the heart?

07:03.737 --> 07:05.731
No. He shot him once in the leg.

07:06.317 --> 07:09.472
Then he went and shot the mother 
who was hiding in the bathroom with her baby.

07:10.018 --> 07:10.962
Really?

07:12.025 --> 07:14.032
He shoots the guy once in the leg

07:14.078 --> 07:17.613
then decides to look around and see
if there's anyone else in the house?

07:17.618 --> 07:19.011
That's your theory?

07:19.838 --> 07:20.621
No.

07:20.817 --> 07:22.171
My theory is...

07:22.346 --> 07:24.673
Martinez shoots Pablo once in the leg.

07:25.217 --> 07:26.611
The sound of the gunshot

07:26.738 --> 07:28.881
startles the baby and makes it cry.

07:33.025 --> 07:34.322
Until  that happens,

07:34.326 --> 07:37.871
it doesn't even occur to Martinez
that somebody else might be in the house.

07:48.406 --> 07:52.302
Meanwhile, the mother is trying
so hard to silence her baby,

07:52.706 --> 07:54.453
she inadvertently smothers it.

07:54.867 --> 07:57.322
By the time Martinez finds her in the bathroom,

07:57.437 --> 07:59.682
she's so consumed with remorse

07:59.976 --> 08:02.071
that she's begging him to end her life.

08:07.887 --> 08:09.483
And that's my theory.

08:10.037 --> 08:11.461
What the hell are you doing?

08:12.446 --> 08:13.662
You're an intern.

08:13.767 --> 08:17.713
Your job is to sort the crime scene photos
and talk us through them, not come up with theories.

08:17.805 --> 08:20.382
This is a district attorney's office,
not a detective agency.

08:20.437 --> 08:21.761
So you don't care what's in my head?

08:21.907 --> 08:24.393
Not if it wasn't in a law book first, no.

08:26.757 --> 08:29.651
"Which of the following might be
a prospective juror's reason...

08:29.686 --> 08:32.633
for suppressing information
that might prejudice him or her

08:32.807 --> 08:34.630
...from participating in a trial?"

08:34.748 --> 08:37.543
A: The prospective juror's actual bias with regard to..."

08:37.544 --> 08:43.193
B: The desire to avoid maligning "one's own reputation
as an objective, bias-free citizen."

08:43.477 --> 08:44.311
Wow.

08:44.748 --> 08:46.000
"B" is right.

08:48.127 --> 08:50.303
I don't think I can be a lawyer, Joe.

08:50.977 --> 08:52.470
Is this about the dreams,

08:53.402 --> 08:54.331
the voices?

08:54.540 --> 08:57.944
They give me pictures to sort,
and I know what happened between the pictures.

08:57.983 --> 09:00.049
I just know.

09:00.759 --> 09:03.253
I sit with Legal Aid cases
and they tell me their stories

09:03.257 --> 09:06.253
and I'm absolutely sure when they're lying
or telling the truth.

09:06.525 --> 09:07.852
I mean, I see it.

09:08.325 --> 09:09.821
I see the truth.

09:10.008 --> 09:10.863
I see it.

09:10.868 --> 09:13.280
It's like a freakin' television show,
and the dreams...

09:13.287 --> 09:15.330
Dreams are dreams. Everybody dreams.

09:15.457 --> 09:18.283
Does everybody see dead people
standing around their bed?

09:19.268 --> 09:21.062
I'm supposed to be an advocate.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.753
I'm supposed to be objective.

09:22.767 --> 09:24.303
I'm supposed to be normal.

09:24.818 --> 09:26.030
You are normal.

09:28.926 --> 09:30.412
I don't feel normal.

09:31.568 --> 09:35.341
Law school, it's a lot of money,
a lot of work, a lot of time.

09:36.086 --> 09:37.442
I'm past 30.

09:38.388 --> 09:40.192
Maybe it's just not meant to be.

09:40.308 --> 09:41.312
Or maybe,

09:42.228 --> 09:44.682
just maybe it's nerves.

09:45.198 --> 09:47.920
- You know, stress can make the mind...
- It's not stress.

09:48.346 --> 09:50.943
I don't know what it is,
but it's not stress.

09:51.045 --> 09:52.542
How do you know that?
You don't know that.

09:52.548 --> 09:53.592
- I do.
- No, you don't.

09:53.596 --> 09:54.092
Yeah.

09:54.095 --> 09:55.743
Who's the scientist in the house?

09:55.868 --> 09:58.053
Am I not the aerospace engineer around here?

09:58.347 --> 10:00.173
Am I not the rocket scientist in the house?

10:00.175 --> 10:01.290
I believe I am.

10:01.298 --> 10:06.073
And what I would like to do is I'd like to apply
the scientific method to this particular conundrum.

10:07.208 --> 10:09.060
What I'm proposing is simple.

10:09.405 --> 10:11.950
Let's take all these scenarios
you've told me about

10:12.726 --> 10:15.912
and let's send them
to the relevant law enforcement agency.

10:16.406 --> 10:20.852
The one you had the other night where the guy confesses
to slitting his wife up the middle?

10:21.118 --> 10:24.620
Let's just fax that to the Phoenix PD.
Let's see if it rings any bells.

10:24.898 --> 10:26.570
I don't follow you.
What's the point of that?

10:26.715 --> 10:30.323
The point is simple. I've got almost 25 of these things
in just the past two years.

10:30.685 --> 10:33.472
If you're really getting messages
from the great beyond,

10:34.567 --> 10:35.362
well,

10:35.956 --> 10:37.652
somebody's going to get back to you.

10:38.518 --> 10:40.120
But if, as I suspect,

10:41.068 --> 10:42.271
these dreams,

10:42.658 --> 10:43.771
these voices,

10:44.378 --> 10:46.472
even the dead people in our bedroom

10:46.775 --> 10:50.093
have more to do with the stress
associated with being a mother of three

10:50.095 --> 10:53.843
while trying to get into law school
and work an internship at the DA's,

10:54.435 --> 10:56.381
well, then let's stick to our plan.

10:56.798 --> 10:59.592
You should go to law school.
You should study hard.

10:59.995 --> 11:02.740
You should become a heartless,
scum-sucking attorney

11:02.938 --> 11:05.680
and buy your husband expensive foreign cars.

11:05.836 --> 11:07.650
Just seems like the right thing to do. 

11:07.695 --> 11:09.513
I  love the way you put me first.

11:24.025 --> 11:25.183
Excuse me.

11:26.855 --> 11:27.893
Excuse me.

11:28.976 --> 11:31.632
You're the intern, right?
I'm sorry, I've forgotten your name.

11:31.637 --> 11:33.033
I know it begins with an "A."

11:33.075 --> 11:34.333
Allison. Allison DuBois.

11:34.366 --> 11:36.432
Right. Listen,
the starter just went on my car,

11:36.457 --> 11:39.870
and the Chief asked me to run out to Brayenton
to interview a witness.

11:40.028 --> 11:41.122
It's  Balinda.

11:41.168 --> 11:43.860
They just took the car.
But Andrea is here.

11:43.968 --> 11:46.160
And she's offered to give me a ride.

11:46.896 --> 11:48.392
Andrea, the intern.

11:50.507 --> 11:51.981
I really appreciate this.

11:52.296 --> 11:53.912
So who are you interviewing?

11:54.646 --> 11:55.810
Some hausfrau

11:55.895 --> 12:00.213
who thinks she can see the future or the past
or whatever it is those people think they see.

12:02.727 --> 12:07.002
Remember the little girl who wandered off
from the shopping center about seven weeks ago?

12:07.098 --> 12:10.392
Well, between you and me,
the boys in law enforcement don't have a clue

12:10.716 --> 12:13.200
and the local news shows
won't talk about anything else.

12:13.208 --> 12:17.483
So now we have to listen to every
Tom, Dick or harried housewife

12:17.517 --> 12:21.061
with too much time on her hands
who thinks she can read tea leaves

12:21.158 --> 12:23.183
or tarot cards or whatever.

12:25.308 --> 12:26.502
It's the guard.

12:27.457 --> 12:28.683
The security guard.

12:28.878 --> 12:30.572
The one we've been looking for
for two months?

12:30.638 --> 12:32.203
Yeah. We think so, too.

12:33.718 --> 12:35.772
Well, don't you want to know where he is?

12:36.875 --> 12:37.952
You know?

12:38.777 --> 12:41.160
I saw him cross the border into Mexico...

12:41.976 --> 12:43.071
with the girl.

12:44.126 --> 12:45.172
"Mexico."

12:46.597 --> 12:47.591
Terrific.

12:48.745 --> 12:49.850
He sold her.

12:50.106 --> 12:51.270
Oh, Mexico?

12:51.496 --> 12:54.051
Any particular part of Mexico

12:54.236 --> 12:55.090
or just...

12:55.458 --> 12:56.352
"Mexico."

12:57.265 --> 12:59.152
I don't know. I see it, but...

12:59.938 --> 13:02.680
I know the name of the town
starts with an "F."

13:04.025 --> 13:06.633
A town in Mexico that starts with "F"?

13:08.415 --> 13:10.141
Eureka.
You've cracked the case.

13:12.876 --> 13:14.060
Oh, great.

13:14.638 --> 13:15.681
No signal.

13:15.918 --> 13:16.720
All right.

13:17.506 --> 13:19.200
I am going to step outside.

13:19.338 --> 13:23.783
Try and call my office, get a list of Mexican cities
that begin with "F."

13:24.365 --> 13:27.761
See if we can't narrow down this haystack
to something more manageable.

13:30.865 --> 13:32.771
Are you with the girl or the guard?

13:32.795 --> 13:36.193
- I mean, when you see these things, whose eyes...?
- The girl is dead.

13:36.925 --> 13:38.963
She can't read. She's only three.

13:39.955 --> 13:41.653
But she knows the letter "F."

13:43.967 --> 13:45.010
I see.

13:46.075 --> 13:48.163
You're talking to the dead girl.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.721
No wonder I can't get a signal in here.

13:53.385 --> 13:54.763
I'll be out front.

14:00.066 --> 14:01.960
She's really a very good lawyer.

14:03.145 --> 14:04.931
You want a beer, don't you?

14:05.245 --> 14:06.263
Pardon me?

14:06.607 --> 14:08.613
You don't like hearing the voices, do you?

14:09.568 --> 14:12.072
The alcohol quiets 'em down for you, I bet.

14:13.517 --> 14:14.931
How 'bout the dead?

14:15.765 --> 14:17.862
You see the dead?
They come visit you?

14:18.897 --> 14:21.071
Want you to pass on
messages to the living?

14:21.288 --> 14:23.281
I have to go. I'm Ms. Alexander's ride.

14:23.288 --> 14:25.440
Why are you at war with who you are?

14:25.945 --> 14:29.093
Ma'am,  respectfully,
I'm not at war with anybody.

14:29.825 --> 14:31.822
I'm just a girl who wants to be a lawyer,

14:31.968 --> 14:34.821
wants to do her job,
be a good wife, a good mother,

14:35.358 --> 14:36.690
be like everybody else.

14:36.716 --> 14:39.212
But you're not like everybody else
and you know that.

14:40.065 --> 14:42.761
Even among the special, you're special.

14:44.128 --> 14:46.122
They're telling me you're the best.

14:46.808 --> 14:50.853
They're telling me, they've been speaking to you
since you were a little girl.

14:51.576 --> 14:53.103
Showing you things.

14:54.948 --> 14:56.843
You know what I'm talking about.

14:57.405 --> 14:58.903
I know I have to go.

14:59.586 --> 15:00.741
I'm here.

15:01.925 --> 15:04.323
If you ever need to make sense out of it.

15:05.625 --> 15:06.790
I'm here.

15:19.895 --> 15:20.861
Sorry.

15:21.017 --> 15:23.122
Sorry. I got pizza.

15:23.376 --> 15:25.321
It's okay. We already did chicken.

15:25.495 --> 15:27.492
It's on the table if you want some.

15:27.638 --> 15:28.712
Hey, girls.

15:29.056 --> 15:30.910
You went easy on Daddy, right?

15:38.007 --> 15:38.813
Hey.

15:39.377 --> 15:40.673
Look who's here.

15:43.495 --> 15:44.543
You mad?

15:45.755 --> 15:46.613
Mm-mm.

15:47.207 --> 15:49.310
Okay, so what gives?

15:52.326 --> 15:53.960
Texas Rangers called.

15:54.126 --> 15:55.583
They read your fax.

15:56.778 --> 15:58.210
They want to see you.

16:08.245 --> 16:09.893
Sorry 'bout the bumpy ride.

16:09.997 --> 16:12.420
There's a big storm over the Gulf of Mexico.

16:13.588 --> 16:15.913
Ever been in a twin-engine prop before?

16:17.608 --> 16:19.041
Ever been to Texas?

16:20.397 --> 16:23.961
So, I'm guessing then that you've never worked with
the Texas Rangers before.

16:25.835 --> 16:27.023
Well, trust me,

16:27.295 --> 16:28.840
the fun is just beginning.

17:14.214 --> 17:15.601
Holy crap.

17:16.588 --> 17:17.910
Miss DuBois?

17:18.646 --> 17:20.883
Miss Allison DuBois?

17:21.228 --> 17:22.132
Mrs.

17:22.935 --> 17:25.751
My name's Captain Kenneth Push
of the Texas Rangers.

17:25.826 --> 17:27.961
I appreciate you coming over here today.

17:30.315 --> 17:31.712
Did you write this?

17:45.188 --> 17:46.682
My husband wrote it.

17:47.065 --> 17:49.201
I told him what to say,
but he wrote it,

17:49.317 --> 17:50.550
faxed it to you.

17:50.786 --> 17:52.280
What you describe,

17:52.628 --> 17:55.420
or what your husband describes on your behalf,

17:56.096 --> 17:58.130
bares an uncanny resemblance

17:58.177 --> 18:01.171
to an event that occurred here recently in Texas

18:03.377 --> 18:07.270
in which a 17-year-old male abducted a six-year-old male

18:08.057 --> 18:11.240
for what we believe to be
his personal sexual gratification.

18:12.726 --> 18:15.202
We presently have the 17-year-old in custody,

18:15.246 --> 18:18.582
although we have not yet recovered
the six-year-old or his remains.

18:19.037 --> 18:21.991
Because the perpetrator of this act
is still technically a minor,

18:22.045 --> 18:25.223
his name was never released to
the media or the general public.

18:25.595 --> 18:27.093
You follow me so far?

18:27.838 --> 18:29.220
I speak English,

18:29.285 --> 18:32.021
and you do a passable job yourself, so yeah.

18:34.747 --> 18:35.903
All right then.

18:37.347 --> 18:40.161
Do you mind telling me,
if nobody knew this fella's name,

18:41.046 --> 18:42.580
how it is that you mention it,

18:42.695 --> 18:46.822
three times, spelled perfectly
 in that fax of yours?

18:48.638 --> 18:50.791
I don't know. I just saw it.

18:51.145 --> 18:52.593
It was on his mail.

18:54.357 --> 18:55.791
You saw his mail?

18:55.987 --> 18:56.762
Sure.

18:59.257 --> 19:01.740
He was looking at it
when he first saw the boy.

19:05.285 --> 19:08.542
He went out to get the mail from his mailbox,
that's when he first spotted him.

19:09.218 --> 19:11.493
At least that's the way it was in my dream.

19:13.976 --> 19:15.353
In your dream?

19:22.118 --> 19:23.551
A dream, huh? 

19:24.715 --> 19:27.671
I know what's going on here, young lady. I do.

19:28.546 --> 19:30.352
You work for the defense.

19:31.015 --> 19:32.993
I don't know what you're talking about.

19:33.576 --> 19:34.921
Oh, don't you?

19:36.497 --> 19:37.982
I throw in with you,

19:38.666 --> 19:40.480
I take you into my confidence,

19:40.615 --> 19:42.693
year later we're sitting in a courtroom...

19:42.935 --> 19:44.832
the  defense puts me up on the stand.

19:45.018 --> 19:48.392
"Isn't it true, Captain Push, "that a soothsayer...

19:48.457 --> 19:48.693
"a fortune teller...

19:48.696 --> 19:49.290
Hey!

19:50.477 --> 19:54.493
"a mystical prognosticator of some kind
helped you assemble this case?"

19:54.808 --> 19:57.400
I don't know what to tell you.
I don't work for anybody.

19:57.796 --> 20:00.240
If you don't want me here,
I will happily go home.

20:00.756 --> 20:02.792
Well, I'll tell you what we're going to do.

20:04.136 --> 20:06.533
I'm going to show you eight crime scenes.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.590
Seven of them are bogus.

20:09.217 --> 20:11.003
You tell me which one's real

20:11.128 --> 20:13.562
and then maybe we'll have something to talk about.

20:16.496 --> 20:17.440
Maybe.

20:33.045 --> 20:34.792
Something happened here, all right.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.011
But I don't think it was any crime.

20:37.348 --> 20:39.010
Least not where I come from.

20:51.288 --> 20:53.230
What do you say we go up
and take a look around?

20:53.347 --> 20:55.781
What do you say we don't?
This is not the place.

21:12.915 --> 21:13.693
Nope.

21:14.048 --> 21:14.903
Yeah.

21:15.796 --> 21:16.743
11th floor.

21:21.966 --> 21:24.080
You are wasting my time.

21:35.705 --> 21:37.203
We're getting close.

21:37.498 --> 21:38.990
Get off at the next exit.

22:07.707 --> 22:09.670
You sure this is where you meant?

22:10.555 --> 22:13.130
Looks to me like the Partridge family lives here.

22:13.398 --> 22:15.530
Oh, I'm sure, and I'm sure you're sure.

22:16.065 --> 22:19.121
And besides, I always thought
those Partridges were a little strange.

22:19.646 --> 22:24.361
Didn't you sense a little something between David Cassidy
and Susan Dey, even if they were brother and sister?

22:24.607 --> 22:25.301
Hm?

22:27.437 --> 22:28.501
Excuse me.

23:00.927 --> 23:01.621
Hi.

23:01.866 --> 23:02.742
Hi.

23:03.608 --> 23:05.412
Hey, what're you listening to?

23:05.606 --> 23:07.400
It's this new band, Hanson.

23:07.475 --> 23:10.190
My older brother just got me
the CD last week.

23:11.795 --> 23:14.421
It's him you're here about, right?

23:15.908 --> 23:18.061
It's about what he did
to that little boy,

23:18.405 --> 23:19.451
isn't it?

23:23.816 --> 23:24.650
Yeah.

23:35.476 --> 23:37.990
This place belongs to the suspect's grandparents.

23:38.625 --> 23:42.341
The suspect and his sister were put here by Social Services in 1995

23:42.348 --> 23:47.141
after their parents were found guilty of neglect,
largely due to uncontrolled heroin addiction.

23:47.958 --> 23:50.112
In 1999 the sister died.

23:51.026 --> 23:53.851
Sounds to me like she had the flu,
which brought on dysentery.

23:54.257 --> 23:58.101
She kept telling everybody she was thirsty,
but obviously, nobody was paying attention.

23:58.578 --> 23:59.951
It's a sad and...

24:00.357 --> 24:01.890
stupid reason to die.

24:03.916 --> 24:04.650
Anyway,

24:04.877 --> 24:06.693
this is definitely where it happened.

24:06.967 --> 24:08.141
I'm sure of it.

24:08.546 --> 24:10.301
The sister saw everything.

24:12.116 --> 24:13.640
The dead sister?

24:15.116 --> 24:15.760
Yeah.

24:17.905 --> 24:19.781
Okay, game over.

24:19.866 --> 24:20.811
That's it.

24:20.976 --> 24:22.200
Everybody get in the vehicles.

24:22.225 --> 24:23.742
- I don't understand.
- Lady,

24:23.967 --> 24:27.213
I don't know who you are,
I don't know where you're getting your information,

24:27.647 --> 24:31.561
but obviously, somebody is feeding you
a whole lot of classified, sensitive data...

24:31.568 --> 24:34.512
- Hey, nobody's feeding me anything.
- I am a career investigator,

24:34.518 --> 24:37.272
I am a career criminologist,

24:37.946 --> 24:42.010
and I will not have some lawyer's stooge

24:42.086 --> 24:43.800
pulling some cheap carney trick

24:43.916 --> 24:46.252
make an ass out of me or the Rangers.

24:46.708 --> 24:49.152
Now, I said we are out of here.

24:50.907 --> 24:53.001
We are out of here!

24:53.157 --> 24:54.053
Hey!

24:54.697 --> 24:56.891
Don't you want to know where the body is?

25:11.125 --> 25:12.371
Right here!

25:12.607 --> 25:14.641
It's about three feet down!

25:16.468 --> 25:17.660
Hold on!

25:19.976 --> 25:22.340
Let's not get in the dirt just yet.

25:25.458 --> 25:28.810
Did we not sweep this area with the dogs?

25:28.817 --> 25:30.923
Yes, sir... about a month ago.

25:32.066 --> 25:35.802
We had a whole truckful of
first-class bloodhounds in here.

25:37.565 --> 25:39.480
They didn't smell anything.

25:40.037 --> 25:41.521
I don't know what to tell you.

25:41.626 --> 25:43.193
Maybe the body wasn't here then.

25:43.335 --> 25:44.951
Maybe he moved the body.

25:45.538 --> 25:47.203
Maybe your dogs had a cold.

25:47.907 --> 25:49.231
All I know is,

25:49.638 --> 25:51.782
the body is here now.

25:53.066 --> 25:54.720
You know that, huh?

25:55.427 --> 25:56.182
Yeah.

25:57.257 --> 25:58.921
And how do you know?

25:59.645 --> 26:00.731
You just get,

26:00.868 --> 26:02.712
what, a feeling?

26:02.858 --> 26:04.552
Like an itch or something?

26:05.556 --> 26:10.440
Or maybe you've seen a secret, unrecovered body map
somewhere that we missed.

26:11.247 --> 26:12.363
Or, hell,

26:12.615 --> 26:18.862
maybe you're online with the folks
at www. i'm buried .com!

26:19.066 --> 26:20.751
I'm talking to you!

26:20.806 --> 26:22.450
No, you're yelling at me

26:22.815 --> 26:24.440
and trying to intimidate me

26:24.566 --> 26:26.523
and attempting to ridicule me.

26:26.777 --> 26:28.773
And you really ought to calm down.

26:29.577 --> 26:33.243
We both know that your heart
can't take this kind of agitation.

26:48.006 --> 26:50.052
Let me give you something to think about.

26:51.746 --> 26:54.440
If I embrace this nonsensical hunch of yours

26:54.917 --> 26:58.413
and waste valuable public resources
by having my 30-odd men here

26:58.415 --> 27:02.633
use the better part of an afternoon
digging up this yard and we don't find a body,

27:02.895 --> 27:06.851
then I figure that makes you
an accessory after the fact...

27:07.645 --> 27:12.222
aiding and abetting a child molester
by providing us with false leads.

27:12.227 --> 27:15.582
And I figure that's good
for three years hard time.

27:17.086 --> 27:17.983
Now...

27:18.906 --> 27:21.901
you ponder that for a second,

27:22.268 --> 27:26.132
and then you tell me one more time
where you think this body is.

27:29.376 --> 27:31.232
You're standing on it.

27:45.678 --> 27:47.262
Anyway, I'm done.

27:47.945 --> 27:49.642
I want to go home now.

27:55.548 --> 27:56.330
Sir...

27:57.018 --> 28:01.010
we've got the men here, we've got the shovels...
what's the harm in doing a little digging?

28:01.057 --> 28:02.352
What's the harm?

28:02.695 --> 28:04.673
You want to know what the harm is?

28:04.916 --> 28:08.010
You wouldn't happen to have a search warrant
on you, Sergeant, would you?

28:08.107 --> 28:08.853
No, sir.

28:14.038 --> 28:16.302
Go find our friend a comfortable hotel room.

28:18.668 --> 28:20.623
Make sure she's got everything she needs.

28:23.697 --> 28:24.981
Hey, you.

28:26.187 --> 28:28.713
Tell me no other law enforcement
agencies have called.

28:28.878 --> 28:32.871
Um, just the District Attorney's Office
wondering when they might get their intern back.

28:33.197 --> 28:34.321
Oh, and, uh, your husband.

28:34.327 --> 28:34.941
Ow!

28:35.055 --> 28:37.450
who was wondering
when he might get his wife back.

28:38.908 --> 28:41.253
- Do you hear that?
- No, go ahead, I'll hold on.

28:49.097 --> 28:50.203
Mrs. DuBois.

28:50.817 --> 28:53.613
I know it's late,
but I wonder if I might show you something.

28:55.757 --> 28:57.053
Give me a minute.

29:01.698 --> 29:04.201
I got to go.
It's Captain Happy at the door.

29:04.758 --> 29:06.751
At this hour?
At your hotel room?

29:07.327 --> 29:09.781
Is there something you want to tell me?
Something I need to know?

29:10.098 --> 29:14.482
Yes. I'm leaving you for the angriest,
ugliest man on the planet.

29:14.875 --> 29:16.721
Now, go to bed. I love you.

29:23.657 --> 29:25.200
Something you want to show me?

29:38.197 --> 29:39.291
Captain Push...

29:46.528 --> 29:48.482
Went in 23 days ago.

29:49.247 --> 29:51.152
I've never been so scared.

29:52.218 --> 29:54.812
That doctor cracked me open like a walnut.

29:56.396 --> 29:59.992
Told me if I didn't calm my life down,
the next time I complained of chest pains,

29:59.997 --> 30:05.023
he wouldn't bother with a needle, thread or latex gloves,
he'd just walk me over to the autopsy room

30:05.026 --> 30:08.370
and have me pick out which drawer
I want to be kept in.

30:09.885 --> 30:12.732
Everybody I knew thought I was fishing up in Alberta.

30:14.865 --> 30:16.360
I don't know how you found out.

30:16.387 --> 30:18.282
I didn't find out; I felt it.

30:18.318 --> 30:21.610
And for what it's worth,
I feel you'll be living a long time.

30:25.288 --> 30:26.052
Oh.

30:30.167 --> 30:31.253
Thanks.

30:35.997 --> 30:37.890
Mrs. DuBois, open up!

30:40.718 --> 30:43.660
Mrs. DuBois, Texas Rangers.
Are you awake?

30:51.717 --> 30:53.063
Mrs. DuBois,

30:53.347 --> 30:56.870
I need you to pack your bags
and come with me to the airport.

30:56.915 --> 30:58.742
The eye of this storm is moving this way,

30:58.748 --> 31:01.692
and if we don't get you out now,
there may not be a runway left.

31:01.738 --> 31:03.453
But I don't understand.

31:03.676 --> 31:05.222
It's 5 : 30 in the morning.

31:05.258 --> 31:09.550
We're supposed to excavate a crime scene
in five hours, look for a body.

31:09.556 --> 31:11.430
You don't understand, Mrs. DuBois.

31:11.438 --> 31:13.560
As of now there is no body.

31:13.656 --> 31:15.351
There is no crime scene.

31:15.557 --> 31:17.412
It's all just gone.

31:17.565 --> 31:19.382
Haven't you watched the television?

31:19.466 --> 31:20.741
This storm here,

31:20.827 --> 31:22.861
it's the biggest in Texas history.

31:22.975 --> 31:25.273
This storm is Hurricane Allison.

31:51.856 --> 31:52.801
You know...

31:53.676 --> 31:57.402
there's nothing to say that when the rain stops,
it all still won't be there...

31:57.497 --> 31:59.061
the body, the evidence...

31:59.106 --> 32:00.630
When the rain finally stops

32:00.636 --> 32:04.591
there'll be nothing left for the dogs to smell.
All the top soil will have washed away.

32:05.916 --> 32:09.182
When the rain finally stops,
who knows where that little boy's body will be?

32:09.547 --> 32:10.973
Carried off by animals?

32:10.976 --> 32:12.573
Picked at?
Maybe eaten.

32:12.636 --> 32:14.333
If there's anything left at all.

32:14.366 --> 32:15.730
If anyone can find it.

32:17.538 --> 32:19.030
When the rain finally stops,

32:19.036 --> 32:20.560
the beast that did this

32:20.996 --> 32:22.752
will be released from jail.

32:22.835 --> 32:26.003
He'll be off to wherever it is that people like that go

32:26.008 --> 32:30.470
and hide and wait for the next
helpless child to suck the life out of.

32:31.378 --> 32:34.402
You know, you are not responsible
for the fact that...

32:34.408 --> 32:37.100
What in God's name am I responsible for?!

32:37.186 --> 32:37.982
Huh?

32:38.657 --> 32:41.232
I am too sensitive to practice law.

32:41.706 --> 32:44.462
But I can't do any good with all my effin' sensitivities,

32:44.465 --> 32:46.913
'cause I'm not sensitive enough to know

32:47.026 --> 32:49.522
that it's gonna freakin' rain!

32:53.916 --> 32:55.993
- Allison...
- Shut up and drive.

33:15.546 --> 33:17.472
Look, I know you're trying
to make me feel better.

33:17.477 --> 33:19.602
But I gotta tell you,
yesterday when I thought,

33:19.688 --> 33:21.160
"I know where this body is,

33:21.195 --> 33:22.793
I can help them hold this guy,

33:22.925 --> 33:24.650
I can help them get this guy,"

33:24.745 --> 33:26.793
I felt so like I was where I belong.

33:26.795 --> 33:28.081
I don't mean in Texas. But,

33:28.328 --> 33:30.050
in the field, on the line, like...

33:31.025 --> 33:32.661
this is what I'm supposed to be doing.

33:32.705 --> 33:34.781
This is why I'm here. Finally!

33:34.835 --> 33:37.120
This is why I am the way I am.

33:37.225 --> 33:39.973
And when I woke up and found that
none of it mattered...

33:40.147 --> 33:42.000
that it had all just been washed away...

33:42.166 --> 33:44.963
that God had played some cruel joke on me...

33:48.897 --> 33:49.730
What?!

33:50.158 --> 33:53.412
You're thinking I'm the most conceited,
self-involved person you've ever met.

33:53.417 --> 33:55.401
- Whoa, what? Hey, did I say...?
- You're thinking,

33:55.416 --> 33:57.112
"What kind of person

33:57.328 --> 34:01.143
"thinks God Himself would unleash a rain storm
just to screw with their head?"

34:01.418 --> 34:03.372
- Oh, that's just nuts.
- Oh, no. I'm nuts.

34:03.378 --> 34:04.670
That's what you think, isn't it?

34:04.675 --> 34:06.422
God, I never said that.

34:06.536 --> 34:07.913
I didn't say you said it.

34:08.107 --> 34:09.743
It's not what I was thinking, either.

34:09.745 --> 34:11.960
What I was thinking was, "Go read his mind...

34:12.078 --> 34:13.771
your 17-year-old pedophile..."

34:13.777 --> 34:15.273
"and leave me alone!"

34:17.885 --> 34:19.750
- That may have been in there.
- Mm-hmm.

34:23.148 --> 34:25.072
Actually, that's a brilliant idea.

34:26.877 --> 34:27.719
What is?

34:33.436 --> 34:35.522
Captain Push of the Texas Rangers, please.

34:36.107 --> 34:39.301
Excuse me, Captain, my client is due
to be released in just nine hours.

34:39.308 --> 34:43.600
If you've uncovered any new evidence that potentially
jeopardizes that, I have a right to know about it.

34:43.606 --> 34:46.552
Why don't you just relax, Counselor?

34:47.346 --> 34:49.590
Don't make me call The New York Times!

34:55.877 --> 34:56.730
Hi.

34:57.806 --> 35:00.482
Thank you for speaking with me.
My name is Allison DuBois.

35:02.887 --> 35:03.843
Okay.

35:04.677 --> 35:06.091
You're with the prison?

35:06.266 --> 35:07.362
Not really.

35:07.895 --> 35:08.641
Oh.

35:09.718 --> 35:12.010
You're a reporter?
'Cause I can't talk to reporters.

35:12.086 --> 35:12.860
No.

35:13.495 --> 35:16.941
I'm actually kind of a friend of your sister's.

35:19.985 --> 35:22.103
Ma'am, my-my sister's dead.

35:22.216 --> 35:23.313
I know that.

35:24.788 --> 35:26.480
She seems happy, by the way.

35:26.527 --> 35:27.601
I mean...

35:28.735 --> 35:31.122
she's worried about you,
'cause of what you did and all.

35:32.156 --> 35:33.601
But aside from that...

35:35.168 --> 35:37.003
She's still at the house, you know.

35:38.037 --> 35:39.720
She saw what you did.

35:40.366 --> 35:42.263
Told me where the body was.

35:45.598 --> 35:47.420
I came here hoping

35:47.685 --> 35:49.732
I would feel something from you...

35:50.248 --> 35:52.652
hear something from inside your head...

35:53.756 --> 35:54.572
but...

35:56.985 --> 35:57.911
What?

36:01.067 --> 36:02.511
You're so pretty.

36:03.475 --> 36:06.670
You look like an ad for milk or toothpaste.

36:07.558 --> 36:09.380
But when I listen to your soul,

36:10.447 --> 36:14.152
all I hear are the sounds
of small animals being tortured

36:14.708 --> 36:16.191
and children crying.

36:19.497 --> 36:21.963
You know,
you didn't walk into this room alone.

36:25.377 --> 36:26.773
I don't mean them.

36:27.287 --> 36:29.492
It's nothing you can see.

36:30.028 --> 36:31.853
But over there, standing in the corner...

36:32.265 --> 36:35.612
is the ghost of the man who molested you
after the Easter barbecue

36:35.618 --> 36:37.961
your aunt and uncle took you to
when you were eight.

36:38.848 --> 36:40.512
And standing next to him

36:40.896 --> 36:42.711
is the man who molested him

36:42.937 --> 36:45.693
at summer camp in Michigan in 1967.

36:45.778 --> 36:47.073
And that man's soul

36:47.116 --> 36:49.461
is forever haunted by the souls
of the three men

36:49.578 --> 36:53.351
who took advantage of that man
when he was a ten-year-old boy back in 1955

36:53.358 --> 36:55.171
on a school trip to Washington D.C.

36:55.226 --> 36:57.472
- I... I would like to go now!
- Wait!

36:58.027 --> 37:00.741
I'm just getting started.
The room is filled with them.

37:01.715 --> 37:03.310
It's you men I'm talking to.

37:03.348 --> 37:05.243
You men know what I'm looking for.

37:05.276 --> 37:07.331
If any of you have anything to say... anything...

37:07.588 --> 37:09.380
to help break this chain of evil...

37:10.048 --> 37:11.642
I can hear you.

37:12.406 --> 37:14.401
You just have to speak to me.

37:15.415 --> 37:17.503
Just speak to me.

37:31.236 --> 37:34.133
He told everything to the boy in the next cell?

37:34.965 --> 37:35.733
Yep.

37:36.558 --> 37:38.850
Who told you this?
Never mind.

37:39.847 --> 37:41.502
I don't want to know.

37:44.135 --> 37:45.573
All right, quiet on this block.

37:45.738 --> 37:47.133
Quiet down, back up.

37:48.575 --> 37:49.951
Quiet on this block.

37:52.248 --> 37:55.653
Raymond Vargas,
stand and approach the cell door, please.

38:11.417 --> 38:12.253
Son,

38:12.826 --> 38:16.850
I have it on pretty good authority
that the boy in the next cell and you

38:17.145 --> 38:19.031
talk some late at night.

38:20.375 --> 38:21.652
Who are you?

38:24.686 --> 38:25.990
And who's she?

38:27.238 --> 38:28.983
Your friend next door...

38:29.296 --> 38:31.711
he ever mention a six-year-old boy?

38:33.756 --> 38:35.662
Where he might have taken him?

38:35.826 --> 38:37.883
What he might have done with him?

38:38.765 --> 38:41.082
What, you mean the kid
who sleeps over here?

38:42.715 --> 38:44.251
He's a prevert.

38:45.847 --> 38:48.202
I don't talk to preverts.

38:49.356 --> 38:51.452
And preverts don't talk to me.

39:03.376 --> 39:05.210
He don't talk to "preverts."

39:11.718 --> 39:12.703
Tell him...

39:14.006 --> 39:15.571
you know about the kiss.

39:17.457 --> 39:18.441
Kiss?

39:18.905 --> 39:20.800
- What kiss?
- Just tell him.

39:21.698 --> 39:22.812
But whisper.

39:31.117 --> 39:32.182
Uh...

39:33.177 --> 39:34.273
So...

39:35.926 --> 39:37.422
you two don't speak?

39:38.336 --> 39:40.452
Man, I already told you, no.

39:42.186 --> 39:43.873
What's the deal with the hat?

39:44.388 --> 39:45.980
Today Cowboy Day?

39:58.416 --> 40:00.942
I know about the kiss.

40:03.247 --> 40:04.393
Wait a second.

40:06.177 --> 40:07.602
He told you that?

40:09.595 --> 40:11.370
The prevert told you about that?

40:13.867 --> 40:15.363
Right now, son,

40:15.847 --> 40:17.443
I'm much more interested

40:17.607 --> 40:19.173
in what he told you.

40:29.638 --> 40:31.032
Thank you, sir.

40:32.518 --> 40:34.182
You will see me in court.

40:34.316 --> 40:35.121
Bye-bye.

40:36.755 --> 40:38.862
That was the State Attorney's office.

40:39.478 --> 40:43.923
They just delivered
Raymond Vargas' sworn statement to the Judge,

40:44.208 --> 40:49.502
and he's agreed to allow us
to hold and formally charge the 17-year-old.

40:49.508 --> 40:50.700
Whoo!

40:51.908 --> 40:54.071
With three hours to spare.

40:56.518 --> 40:58.350
So, I'm curious.

40:59.065 --> 41:00.250
The kiss...

41:00.866 --> 41:03.320
you didn't mention that
before we went into Raymond's cell.

41:03.368 --> 41:04.963
Who told you about that?

41:05.718 --> 41:08.520
Was there some... ghost...

41:09.188 --> 41:12.282
some spirit there on the cell block
with us that was talking to you?

41:12.448 --> 41:13.740
Well... no.

41:14.008 --> 41:16.152
Well, how'd you find out about that kiss?

41:17.018 --> 41:18.363
I made it up.

41:21.515 --> 41:22.931
Excuse me, lady?

41:23.005 --> 41:25.101
Oh, put your bug eyes back in your head.

41:25.107 --> 41:27.163
I said I made it up.
I took a shot.

41:27.407 --> 41:32.703
I figured he'd either be so offended he'd talk,
or he'd be so embarrassed he'd talk. So, either way...

41:33.155 --> 41:36.852
This... is not good for my heart.

41:41.675 --> 41:42.770
Thank you.

41:44.048 --> 41:45.120
Really.

41:46.016 --> 41:47.160
Thank you.

41:49.465 --> 41:50.761
No. Thank you.

41:59.988 --> 42:03.082
So, anyway,
I've come to the conclusion that I am...

42:03.407 --> 42:06.322
constitutionally incapable of being an attorney.

42:08.748 --> 42:09.682
Okay.

42:11.215 --> 42:14.113
But I'm confused.
What led to this change of heart?

42:14.776 --> 42:16.670
I can't really talk about it.

42:17.328 --> 42:21.570
Suffice it to say,
I'm apparently either a little psychic or a little psycho.

42:23.537 --> 42:24.433
Oh.

42:25.066 --> 42:28.563
So, anyway, I wanted to come in
and officially resign my internship.

42:28.867 --> 42:29.760
I see.

42:30.118 --> 42:31.973
And thank you again for the opportunity.

42:33.025 --> 42:33.851
Allison.

42:35.897 --> 42:37.993
While you were gone, Martinez confessed.

42:38.166 --> 42:40.132
Seems he did shoot Pablo once in the leg.

42:40.147 --> 42:42.581
Then he said he heard a baby crying...

42:42.918 --> 42:45.290
shot the mother
who had accidentally suffocated the baby.

42:45.296 --> 42:47.513
Then he came back and shot Pablo

42:48.197 --> 42:49.471
six more times.

42:52.905 --> 42:55.181
So what does this mean?
What are you going to do now?

42:59.115 --> 43:00.591
So, he just hired you?

43:00.728 --> 43:03.023
Well it's not full time.
I'm more like a consultant.

43:03.135 --> 43:05.153
A secret consultant, and we can't really tell anybody that I work there.

43:05.155 --> 43:06.593
Cool!

43:07.116 --> 43:08.082
Yeah!

43:08.508 --> 43:10.141
He wants me to help him pick

43:10.315 --> 43:14.513
juries, interview potential witnesses and suspects,
go on lineups, things like that.

43:14.787 --> 43:17.483
They're only going to call me when they need me.
We're sort of going to play it by ear.

43:17.515 --> 43:18.563
That's awesome.

43:18.568 --> 43:20.090
- Thanks.
- Holy cow!

43:20.135 --> 43:22.112
Holy cow!

43:22.528 --> 43:25.932
Yeah. I really want you to go in
and just get him to tell you his story.

43:35.125 --> 43:37.723
They wanted you to have this.
It's his statement.

43:37.777 --> 43:40.651
- They thought you might want to take a look at it.
- Thanks.

43:49.188 --> 43:53.190
So, according to the statement you gave the police,
you came home from...

43:56.376 --> 43:58.612
work, and she was just...

44:00.747 --> 44:03.591
your wife, I mean...
she was just there like that.

44:04.996 --> 44:05.970
Yeah.

44:07.586 --> 44:09.521
I got off at 5 : 20.

44:10.178 --> 44:11.440
Drove home.

44:12.058 --> 44:13.650
Stopped for gas.

44:15.515 --> 44:17.492
It was winter, you know, so...

44:19.105 --> 44:21.443
by the time I pulled in the driveway,
it was dark.
