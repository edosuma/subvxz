00:14.416 --> 00:18.083
<i>First of all, there are some things</i>
<i>you should know before we begin.</i>

00:18.166 --> 00:22.458
<i>For instance, we are real people,</i>
<i>just like you.</i>

00:22.708 --> 00:25.208
<i>Secondly,</i>
<i>we did not write a word of this.</i>

00:25.375 --> 00:26.625
<i>To be perfectly frank, </i>

00:26.708 --> 00:29.500
<i>we would have preferred</i>
<i>all of this remain a secret.</i>

00:29.625 --> 00:31.791
<i>But we had no choice</i>
<i>in the matter.</i>

00:31.875 --> 00:35.333
<i>We just woke up one day</i>
<i>and everything changed.</i>

00:35.500 --> 00:37.875
<i>There were stories about us</i>
<i>everywhere:</i>

00:38.125 --> 00:40.666
<i>TV, newspapers, and the internet.</i>

00:40.916 --> 00:44.166
<i>And now it is our turn</i>
<i>to tell a few stories.</i>

00:44.458 --> 00:47.916
<i>Think of them as fairy tales</i>
<i>that actually happened.</i>

00:48.375 --> 00:51.750
<i>Don't worry,</i>
<i>these stories are not just about us.</i>

00:52.250 --> 00:53.791
<i>They're also about you.</i>

00:54.041 --> 00:55.833
<i>And how is that possible?</i>

00:56.166 --> 01:00.166
<i>Because all these stories</i>
<i>are about money.</i>

01:00.500 --> 01:04.041
<i>The idea of money.</i>
<i>The necessity of money.</i>

01:04.583 --> 01:07.125
<i>The secret life of money.</i>

01:07.333 --> 01:10.375
Before money,
there was only the barter system.

01:10.458 --> 01:14.500
You tried to trade what you had
or you could do for what you needed.

01:14.708 --> 01:17.166
You have bananas, but you need a cow.

01:17.541 --> 01:19.833
I have a cow, but I hate bananas.

01:19.916 --> 01:23.416
So, as you can imagine,
there was a limit to this system.

01:23.625 --> 01:27.708
Bananas turn brown over time
and cows can, you know, wander away.

01:27.791 --> 01:31.458
So an agreed-upon
medium of exchange was needed.

01:31.833 --> 01:33.916
What is a medium of exchange?

01:34.791 --> 01:38.000
-Well, it could be a... a nugget of gold.

01:38.083 --> 01:41.833
Or some other shiny rocks
that are generally found to be scarce.

01:42.333 --> 01:45.583
It could be a... a slip of paper

01:46.458 --> 01:47.708
-with words on it...
-Aah!

01:47.791 --> 01:49.875
...or pictures of powerful people.

01:50.250 --> 01:51.666
And if you read those words,

01:51.750 --> 01:55.958
you will see that they are arranged
into a promise of value.

02:00.833 --> 02:02.458
-Slips of paper...

02:02.541 --> 02:06.708
...which you cannot peel and eat,
and do not give milk

02:06.791 --> 02:09.125
are what we all agreed
to call "money."

02:09.416 --> 02:14.083
And these slips gave birth
to many other pieces of paper

02:14.166 --> 02:17.166
-with more writing on them.

02:17.250 --> 02:23.083
And some of those words,
they told the story of credit.

02:24.291 --> 02:26.666
Oh, stay with us now,
this is important.

02:27.625 --> 02:33.375
Credit is an invention that meant
you no longer needed to carry around, uh,

02:33.583 --> 02:36.375
millions of bananas on slips of paper.

02:36.458 --> 02:39.250
So, you now have something invisible,
credit,

02:39.333 --> 02:42.291
standing in for something tangible,
a cow.

02:42.375 --> 02:44.458
Credit said that even if you didn't have

02:44.625 --> 02:47.583
all the bananas you need
for what you want,

02:48.208 --> 02:50.416
you could borrow bananas

02:50.958 --> 02:52.666
from the future.

02:52.750 --> 02:57.250
So, credit is just the future tense
of the language of money.

02:59.250 --> 03:01.125
Speaking of the future...

03:01.500 --> 03:04.958
Uh, things have gotten
a little more complicated.

03:05.041 --> 03:07.500
Actually, a lot more complicated.

03:07.583 --> 03:10.833
There is more money than ever before.

03:10.916 --> 03:13.666
Our money has more names
than ever before.

03:13.750 --> 03:18.166
Commodities, loans, stocks, and bonds.

03:18.250 --> 03:21.000
Funds and funds of funds.

03:21.083 --> 03:24.666
Futures, equity,
derivatives, securitized debt,

03:24.750 --> 03:26.208
shorts and margin calls.

03:26.291 --> 03:28.000
Financial instruments.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.208
Words.

03:29.583 --> 03:31.333
-Invisible.

03:31.416 --> 03:32.583
Abstract.

03:33.708 --> 03:35.583
Very different from cows.

04:02.625 --> 04:04.416
Morning has broken.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.291
- Morning.
-Mwah!

04:06.458 --> 04:08.416
-Come on, buddy.
-What time is it?

04:08.500 --> 04:09.916
It's time.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.583
Did you remember to take all your--

04:12.666 --> 04:13.500
Yes!

04:14.041 --> 04:17.208
-You didn't even let me finish.
-I took them, I took everything.

04:18.083 --> 04:19.541
-Big fat liar.
-I'm not.

04:19.625 --> 04:21.583
You know,
they're not gonna wait for us, Joe.

04:21.666 --> 04:22.625
Okay, yeah.

04:22.708 --> 04:24.458
-So....
-I can't do the laces.

04:24.541 --> 04:27.041
-You can have this. I'll take this off.
-No, I'm all right.

04:27.125 --> 04:29.791
-I think it's gonna warm up.
-Oh, look. They haven't left yet.

04:29.875 --> 04:31.958
-No, no, we're all right.
- Oh, gosh.

04:32.041 --> 04:33.041
We're all right.

04:33.958 --> 04:35.416
If they ask about it.

04:35.500 --> 04:37.000
-They'll save a place for us.
-Yeah.

04:37.083 --> 04:38.583
-You think?
-Yeah.

04:38.750 --> 04:40.625
-There they are.
-Drop a line in.

04:40.708 --> 04:41.958
What would you catch?

04:42.333 --> 04:44.125
-Oh, here's Barb. Hi.
-Probably an old boot.

04:44.208 --> 04:47.333
-Hey. Sorry.
-The line's movin', it's okay.

04:47.416 --> 04:49.291
Tryin' to move him out is like,
you know...

04:49.375 --> 04:50.333
Yep.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.750
All right. Yeah, that's great.
I'm glad. I didn't remember.

04:55.166 --> 04:57.166
-Shall we let them go, or...
-Uh...

04:58.791 --> 04:59.791
That's it.

04:59.875 --> 05:02.958
-Careful on this thing, it gets tricky.
-Yeah, it gets a little slippery.

05:04.125 --> 05:05.583
-Okay.
-Thank you.

05:08.250 --> 05:09.208
Honey?

05:09.583 --> 05:11.291
Yeah? Oh, look, a place. Oh.

05:12.041 --> 05:13.541
-Oh, and leg room..
-Yeah.

05:13.625 --> 05:14.458
...to boot.

05:15.791 --> 05:16.625
Sweet.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.708
Good afternoon, Trenton travelers.

05:32.125 --> 05:33.250
This is Richard Paris.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.500
I'll be your captain here
on historic Lake George.

05:36.583 --> 05:42.208
We got a magnificent fall day,
so sit back and relax and enjoy the view.

05:44.166 --> 05:45.708
Posh seats, huh?

05:45.791 --> 05:46.833
-No.

05:46.916 --> 05:49.625
Hey, you know where
the word "posh" comes from?

05:49.708 --> 05:51.875
-Do you know, Barb?
-No idea, El.

05:52.166 --> 05:54.500
Oh, is this one
of your crossword puzzle things

05:54.583 --> 05:57.625
-or a fun fact off a calendar?
- Go on, tell her.

05:57.833 --> 06:00.375
The posh seats on a boat, the good seats,

06:00.583 --> 06:04.291
were called that because when cruises went
from England to Africa,

06:04.375 --> 06:07.833
if you were sitting on the port side
on the way there, you saw land.

06:07.916 --> 06:11.625
Yeah, and when you would go back,
you'd want to sit on the starboard side,

06:11.708 --> 06:14.291
so that you're not
lookin' out at nothing all day.

06:14.666 --> 06:16.958
Port Out, Starboard Home.

06:17.333 --> 06:20.541
P-O-S-H. It's... It's a... an acronym.

06:20.625 --> 06:21.458
Yeah.

06:21.958 --> 06:24.166
Boy, you guys sure know a lot of trivia.

06:24.625 --> 06:28.041
Well, you weren't just staring at nothing.

06:28.125 --> 06:32.833
I-- I mean, if you had eyes at all,
you'd be looking at something.

06:32.916 --> 06:36.458
Maybe clouds or whales, but something.

06:38.666 --> 06:39.666
Maybe.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.791
All right, comin' up
on your right-hand side

06:41.875 --> 06:43.958
just a couple meters beneath the surface

06:45.041 --> 06:47.583
is the Sunken Fleet of 1758.

06:48.500 --> 06:51.500
- Oh, that's what that is.
-British soldiers stationed on the lake

06:51.583 --> 06:54.291
sank over 260 vessels to keep them

06:54.375 --> 06:56.916
-from being captured by the French.
- Amazing it's lasted.

06:58.000 --> 06:58.958
Captain?

07:01.916 --> 07:03.833
Ah, shit, where did that come from?

07:10.416 --> 07:11.625
Whoa!

07:41.333 --> 07:44.541
Ellen and Joe went on their honeymoon
in Niagara Falls

07:44.625 --> 07:47.833
and they were on their way back there
the day we lost Joe.

07:49.000 --> 07:54.000
His dear friend Norm Sidley told me that
Joe had a ruby pendant in his pocket

07:54.083 --> 07:56.375
that he planned to give to Ellen
at the Falls,

07:56.458 --> 07:58.208
because a 40th anniversary...

07:59.875 --> 08:00.875
is ruby,

08:02.166 --> 08:03.750
a stone of uncommon beauty.

08:05.541 --> 08:07.416
And Joe Martin was just as rare.

08:09.500 --> 08:12.875
The common man has become
anything but that.

08:14.500 --> 08:17.041
Men who love their wives without stopping.

08:17.125 --> 08:19.833
Men who are there for their children
without fail.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.791
Men who pay their taxes
and shovel their neighbor's walk.

08:25.125 --> 08:28.500
Men who drive the speed limit, even
when there's nobody there to watch them.

08:28.708 --> 08:32.166
This is the 14th of 21 funerals

08:32.500 --> 08:35.166
that this tragedy has visited
upon our community.

08:37.125 --> 08:40.582
Each one sharpening the pain
of our shared loss.

08:44.250 --> 08:48.375
So... So, what happens next?
What do we do next?

08:49.250 --> 08:53.583
Well, uh, Shoreline Cruises,
like most of these outfits,

08:53.666 --> 08:56.125
they have insurance
for accidents and such.

08:56.958 --> 09:00.791
And that involves filing a claim,
which they have done with the carrier.

09:00.875 --> 09:05.250
So basically, they drowned Joe
and 20 other innocent people,

09:05.333 --> 09:07.333
and you can get insurance for that?

09:08.500 --> 09:14.250
You know, Gwen Musgrave says that she can
still feel Bucky Mecklenberg's actual hand

09:14.625 --> 09:19.125
on her leg, pullin' it, tryin' to get up
to the surface to get the air.

09:19.458 --> 09:22.875
You know, she feels it in the middle
of the night, just layin' there.

09:24.666 --> 09:27.000
Drowning man's hand on her leg. Whew.

09:27.458 --> 09:29.666
What kind of compensation is there
for that?

09:30.125 --> 09:33.916
Well, Shoreline is tellin' me that they
bought a policy from one company

09:34.000 --> 09:36.791
and then they were reinsured
through another company.

09:37.541 --> 09:42.416
But I'm expecting a settlement offer
in the mid-seven figures as a start.

09:42.666 --> 09:44.041
Here's what they're saying.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.416
-Who?
-United.

09:46.416 --> 09:49.083
I thought our insurance was
through that firm Monarch.

09:49.166 --> 09:50.208
It was. Uh--

09:50.291 --> 09:52.625
We did. Well, actually, GPOA.

09:52.958 --> 09:54.000
And what's that?

09:54.083 --> 09:57.666
Global Property Owners Association.
That's who insured this place.

09:57.750 --> 09:59.791
And they insured the boat as well.

10:00.291 --> 10:01.875
-So what's Monarch?

10:01.958 --> 10:04.083
GPOA became Monarch.

10:04.458 --> 10:07.000
But now this guy, Mr. Purser,

10:07.083 --> 10:12.250
is saying that Monarch itself is insured
by-- by a firm called, uh, United.

10:13.333 --> 10:16.583
So United takes over the policy
from Monarch.

10:18.083 --> 10:19.666
So United is gonna pay.

10:20.375 --> 10:23.291
That's the thing. We got this note saying,

10:24.333 --> 10:26.833
"The money you have already saved
on your insurance

10:26.916 --> 10:30.333
is nothing in comparison to having
an accident with one of your boats

10:30.416 --> 10:32.958
while operating them on the lake,
where they have no coverage.

10:33.750 --> 10:36.541
I strongly urge you
to reconsider the quote

10:36.625 --> 10:39.833
for marine liability and hull coverage
on your entire fleet.

10:40.041 --> 10:42.583
I realize that you know the lake
much better than we do

10:42.666 --> 10:46.666
and you have never had an accident before,
but this is our recommendation to you."

10:47.625 --> 10:50.250
No coverage? Who said that?

10:50.333 --> 10:51.666
Purser at Monarch.

10:52.041 --> 10:54.083
But I thought you said Monarch is United.

10:54.166 --> 10:55.208
Right, it is.

10:55.291 --> 10:57.916
And Monarch is saying
that our policy expired be--

10:58.791 --> 11:00.041
before the accident,

11:00.375 --> 11:02.541
so United is off the hook.

11:04.916 --> 11:06.041
Jesus.

11:07.208 --> 11:08.291
You let it lapse?

11:08.375 --> 11:11.541
-No. No, I--
-And we're gonna be exposed here?

11:11.625 --> 11:13.750
-Us personally?
-No. It's not true...

11:14.083 --> 11:14.916
Rich.

11:19.375 --> 11:20.708
You gonna answer?

11:22.916 --> 11:25.041
What area code is 518? You know?

11:25.666 --> 11:27.916
- Europe?

11:28.083 --> 11:30.708
It's not Europe.
Europe have different numbers.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.750
If you answered, you could ask.

11:34.791 --> 11:37.625
You didn't sign these, Irvin.

11:37.708 --> 11:41.083
These were supposed to be sent back
to Mossack Fonseca days ago.

11:44.625 --> 11:48.916
RDPS Trading, TEP Consulting,
Wilkinson Systems Limited.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.166
You need to be signing where it says
"Director" on all of these.

11:52.625 --> 11:55.625
I need to fax these back to Panama
by the end of the day.

11:57.041 --> 11:57.875
Irvin!

12:02.875 --> 12:05.500
That's $15 a signature, sweetie.

12:08.750 --> 12:11.708
Also, Christopher Purser
called from Houston,

12:11.791 --> 12:15.000
said there's a problem
with the Monarch-United arrangement.

12:15.083 --> 12:16.416
What kinda problem?

12:17.041 --> 12:18.500
Boat sank in New York.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.708
Twenty-one people died.
He wants to know what to do.

12:22.791 --> 12:24.625
You want me to get him on the phone?

12:33.708 --> 12:37.166
<i>Hey, this is Matthew Quirk</i>
<i>calling for Mr. Boncamper.</i>

12:37.250 --> 12:41.250
<i>Uh, my lawyer says you're the nominee</i>
<i>director for United Reinsurance.</i>

12:41.333 --> 12:44.375
<i>I filed an accident claim</i>
<i>for Shoreline Cruises</i>

12:44.458 --> 12:46.875
<i>and I need to speak with you</i>
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

12:46.958 --> 12:48.958
<i>My number is area code 518--</i>

12:49.375 --> 12:50.333
Shit.

12:50.791 --> 12:52.291
I got some bad news.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.875
A very unfortunate turn of events.

12:57.791 --> 13:01.333
Mr. Purser, who sold us the policy
down in Houston

13:01.416 --> 13:03.458
is, um... under investigation

13:03.541 --> 13:07.666
by some sort of professional
oversight organization there in Texas.

13:07.750 --> 13:09.916
He's not allowed
to sell insurance anymore.

13:10.375 --> 13:12.875
Ever. The IRS is involved.

13:12.958 --> 13:18.208
There were gyms with claims
and, uh, nursing homes with claims.

13:19.708 --> 13:21.041
We're not the only ones.

13:21.833 --> 13:24.000
Uh, they said, "Get in line."

13:28.208 --> 13:30.125
I was tryin' to save some money, Rich.

13:32.833 --> 13:36.375
And they were cheaper.
Monarch was... they were much cheaper.

13:37.166 --> 13:40.708
We were expanding the restaurant
and buying a second boat.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.583
Matty, they're gonna come
after us, aren't they?

13:46.625 --> 13:49.125
I can't sleep at night. Um...

13:50.166 --> 13:52.208
I have dreams about those people.

13:54.166 --> 13:58.083
Faces floating up in the waves,
bodies washin' up on the beach.

13:58.166 --> 13:59.166
Beach by my house.

14:03.541 --> 14:05.500
Maybe we could try to settle with 'em.

14:05.750 --> 14:08.833
Of course, we--
Of course, we want to settle.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.958
We are hat in hand here, Rich.

14:14.416 --> 14:17.958
Hat in hand, wanting to settle
with the best of intentions.

14:29.583 --> 14:31.583
-What do you think?
-Let's go!

14:31.666 --> 14:32.833
-Whoo!
-Whoa!

14:32.916 --> 14:34.625
I know! Automatic!

14:37.708 --> 14:40.291
-Sometimes I get lost. Okay...
-This way?

14:40.375 --> 14:41.875
-All the way down there.
- Whoo!

14:41.958 --> 14:43.458
There, right to the elevator.

14:43.916 --> 14:45.541
-Good boy.
-Oh, wow.

14:45.625 --> 14:47.041
-Whoa!

14:47.125 --> 14:49.875
-Waah-oooh!
-Whoo!

14:49.958 --> 14:51.833
-I'm gonna catch you!
-No, you're not!

14:51.916 --> 14:54.375
-Oh, Mom, this is so great.
-I know.

14:55.875 --> 14:57.333
Think your dad would approve?

14:58.458 --> 15:00.166
-He'd love it, Mom.
- Come on!

15:00.416 --> 15:02.000
- Oh, no!
-I think so too.

15:02.083 --> 15:04.625
Hey, kids, come here, come here. Look.

15:05.166 --> 15:07.000
-Can you see the Eiffel Tower?
-What?

15:07.083 --> 15:08.583
-Can you see it?
-Yeah.

15:08.666 --> 15:10.208
It looks like Paris, France.

15:11.083 --> 15:12.916
-Wait.
-Can you see? Kaylen, look.

15:13.500 --> 15:15.916
They light it up all night long.
It's so pretty.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.083
But here's the best, best, best part.

15:18.500 --> 15:19.958
Can you see by the palm tree?

15:20.166 --> 15:21.833
-Oh, yes, I can.
-Yeah.

15:23.458 --> 15:27.708
Years ago, there was a guy there who
could write your name on a grain of rice.

15:27.791 --> 15:30.125
-What?
-For 25 cents.

15:30.208 --> 15:31.708
-That's a bargain.
-I know.

15:31.791 --> 15:33.416
-Whoa.
-And...

15:33.791 --> 15:38.458
that corner is the corner
where I met your grandfather.

15:40.125 --> 15:41.708
-Oh.

15:42.333 --> 15:44.083
He was here for a tire convention,

15:44.166 --> 15:48.375
and I was here
'cause my girlfriend's bachelorette party.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.666
And he took me to see Diana Ross
at Caesars.

15:53.291 --> 15:55.250
How he got those tickets...

15:55.375 --> 15:58.208
Although he did tell me later
that he stole 'em

15:58.291 --> 16:00.458
-out of his boss's briefcase.

16:00.541 --> 16:02.750
-Which is bad.

16:03.291 --> 16:06.875
But he said that he knew her from Detroit.

16:07.250 --> 16:08.708
He sold her tires.

16:09.208 --> 16:12.541
This is one of the Supremes.
I don't think so.

16:13.875 --> 16:16.416
Anyway, she came out onstage and he said,

16:17.708 --> 16:22.375
"The most beautiful woman
I have ever seen in my whole life."

16:25.000 --> 16:28.000
But then he leaned over to me
and he said, "Except for you."

16:29.041 --> 16:30.250
-Aw.
-Was he kidding?

16:30.500 --> 16:32.916
Oh! "Was he kidding?"

16:35.875 --> 16:40.458
So, I was supposed to drive back
to Sacramento with Connie, but I didn't.

16:40.791 --> 16:44.083
I stayed the whole weekend,
'cause it was Labor Day weekend.

16:44.208 --> 16:48.208
And we, uh... we went to the Jerry Lewis
muscular dystrophy telethon,

16:48.291 --> 16:49.583
saw that live.

16:50.333 --> 16:53.916
We went and got mai tai
after mai tai after mai tai.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.458
What's a mai tai?

16:55.833 --> 16:58.625
Oh, that's a Hawaiian
fertility drug, honey.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.625
-Mom.

17:01.041 --> 17:04.000
Your mom was conceived
under a paper umbrella

17:04.083 --> 17:06.583
when we were $68 up at slots.

17:06.708 --> 17:09.290
Yeah!

17:09.415 --> 17:11.790
Okay, listen, kids,
why don't you put your swimsuits on?

17:11.875 --> 17:13.458
-There is a pool on the roof.
-Really?

17:13.540 --> 17:15.290
-Yeah.
-Oh, my goodness.

17:16.165 --> 17:18.500
-Pool, here I come.
-Pool, here I come.

17:19.375 --> 17:20.208
Whoo!

17:20.290 --> 17:21.833
-Mrs. Martin?
- Yeah?

17:22.333 --> 17:23.500
-Hi, Hannah!
-Hi--

17:23.583 --> 17:25.290
-This is my daughter, Melanie.
-Hi.

17:25.375 --> 17:27.000
-Did you get my message?
-And my grandkid--

17:27.083 --> 17:28.875
-What? No, what me--
-I left you a message.

17:28.958 --> 17:32.833
Oh. Well, I've been so busy with
the yard sale and the packing and the--

17:32.916 --> 17:35.125
I'm not sure my mom knows how
to check her messages.

17:35.208 --> 17:37.166
I've been stayin' with her
out in Denver, so--

17:37.250 --> 17:40.166
Hey, let me-- Kids, come here.
I want you to meet somebody.

17:40.666 --> 17:41.916
-This is...
-Hello!

17:42.000 --> 17:43.958
...Kaylen! And this is Thalia.

17:44.041 --> 17:45.291
-Hello!
-Ah.

17:45.375 --> 17:48.083
She is a great butterfly swimmer.

17:48.166 --> 17:49.125
Mwah!

17:49.208 --> 17:50.541
Olympic hopeful.

17:50.625 --> 17:51.833
Bet you got your swimsuit on

17:51.916 --> 17:53.666
-underneath that shirt, don't you?
-Yeah!

17:53.750 --> 17:55.125
Pick me up!

17:55.208 --> 17:58.208
Do you-- Do you just--
I'd like to speak to you for a minute.

17:58.291 --> 18:00.291
-If we could just....
-Oh, sure, sure.

18:00.375 --> 18:02.041
Okay, we're gonna go swimming soon.

18:02.125 --> 18:04.000
-Here, wait here.
-Mom, I wanna go swimming.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.083
-Let's play I Spy. What do you see?
- Me too.

18:06.166 --> 18:08.208
-What do you see?
- I spy something blue.

18:10.041 --> 18:11.541
This unit's been sold.

18:12.291 --> 18:13.916
-What?
-Not to you.

18:16.041 --> 18:17.708
Well, where-- Can't I-- Wh--

18:18.750 --> 18:22.208
What's the word? Counter? Counter.
Can't I even counter?

18:22.708 --> 18:25.333
They paid double the asking price.
In cash.

18:26.041 --> 18:28.708
And they bought three units
that they want to combine.

18:29.833 --> 18:31.541
So what do I-- What happens to me?

18:32.291 --> 18:35.625
Well, I have a wonderful
one-bedroom Bristol.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.958
It has Italian marble everywhere.

18:38.041 --> 18:40.625
-I don't care about marble.
-I could show you. It'd be great.

18:40.708 --> 18:43.125
No, I don't care.
I just want to look out and see Joe.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.750
-Joe?
-I want to look out and see my corner.

18:48.625 --> 18:51.583
Well, okay. I don't have anything
facing that direction,

18:51.666 --> 18:58.166
but I do have a three-bedroom Hennessey
facing north.

18:58.250 --> 18:59.416
-It's gorgeous.
-No.

18:59.500 --> 19:00.750
-I could show you that?
-No.

19:00.833 --> 19:02.541
-No, not north.
-It's really wonderful.

19:02.625 --> 19:04.375
-I could--
-Fuck north. No.

19:04.791 --> 19:07.875
I am puttin' down the settlement money
from the accident.

19:09.333 --> 19:12.041
I look out there
and I see him smilin' at me,

19:12.125 --> 19:13.500
holdin' two tickets.

19:13.583 --> 19:14.583
You see who?

19:14.666 --> 19:17.166
Two tickets to the rest of my life.

19:18.416 --> 19:23.625
I walk around Detroit, I see him reachin'
up for dead leaves in a lake.

19:26.166 --> 19:29.000
If these people,
whoever they are, if they knew...

19:29.291 --> 19:30.708
I could explain it to 'em.

19:31.041 --> 19:34.958
-There are so many places they could live.
-I can't give you their name, by law.

19:35.041 --> 19:37.375
-Maybe you could talk to their lawyer.

19:37.458 --> 19:39.500
That's right.
I could write 'em a letter.

19:39.583 --> 19:42.083
That wouldn't be
an invasion of anybody's privacy.

19:42.166 --> 19:44.958
-I can't give you their name.
-Or if I could just talk to 'em.

19:45.041 --> 19:46.541
-Why?
-Privacy.

19:47.041 --> 19:50.583
Cash. Who pays cash?

19:51.458 --> 19:52.583
Russians.

19:55.083 --> 19:57.250
Aren't we going swimming?

19:57.333 --> 19:59.541
-Aren't we going swimming?

19:59.625 --> 20:02.208
Mom, what's wrong? What did she say?

20:03.666 --> 20:05.416
-You okay, Grandma?
-Mom, what is it?

20:05.500 --> 20:07.083
-Yes, I'm fine.
-Are you sure?

20:13.000 --> 20:15.250
-Grandma, can I go to the pool?

20:15.333 --> 20:16.333
Wait a second.

20:16.416 --> 20:18.416
-Nice to see you again.

20:20.291 --> 20:23.083
You guys, you go on down.
I'll meet you in the lobby.

20:28.250 --> 20:31.458
I just saw your email
with the paperwork attached.

20:32.083 --> 20:34.291
You have worked
with offshore entities before?

20:34.416 --> 20:35.541
Of course.

20:35.916 --> 20:39.250
Yeah, we did the same thing
in New York when we bought there.

20:39.333 --> 20:41.958
-Helps us with taxes and other things.
- Oooh!

20:42.375 --> 20:44.125
-Amazing!
- Now we're cooking.

20:44.208 --> 20:47.500
- That's great, Hannah. Incredible!
- I have all three on ho--

21:15.000 --> 21:18.875
So, how does it all work,
this world of offshore companies?

21:19.083 --> 21:21.000
And how do you know if it is for you?

21:21.333 --> 21:25.583
First of all, you must ask yourself,
are you wealthy?

21:26.166 --> 21:31.333
There are just over two thousand
billionaires on planet Earth.

21:31.875 --> 21:34.791
Maybe you are one of them,
or maybe you are just a millionaire.

21:34.875 --> 21:37.500
There are 15 million of them in the world.

21:38.458 --> 21:42.333
Perhaps you are older now
and it's time to contemplate your legacy.

21:42.541 --> 21:46.291
Or maybe you are younger and
building an empire like our friends here.

21:50.166 --> 21:53.416
<i>Your ambitions lead you to a place</i>
<i>that deals with money.</i>

21:53.750 --> 21:56.958
<i>For instance, a bank. A big bank.</i>

21:57.041 --> 21:58.541
<i>Probably in Europe.</i>

21:58.625 --> 22:03.000
<i>And you find yourself sitting</i>
<i>across a desk from a wealth manager,</i>

22:03.458 --> 22:06.208
<i>a financial advisor, a banker.</i>

22:06.291 --> 22:09.583
<i>You lay out your fears.</i>
<i>Income tax, state tax,</i>

22:09.666 --> 22:12.958
<i>inheritance tax, capital gains taxes.</i>

22:13.166 --> 22:15.500
Your advisor understands your concerns

22:15.583 --> 22:17.625
and suggests you set up
an offshore company,

22:17.708 --> 22:20.125
where your assets
will be safe from scrutiny.

22:20.208 --> 22:22.250
And that's where we come in.

22:23.375 --> 22:27.791
<i>Now, we supply you with a shell company,</i>
<i>which holds your assets.</i>

22:28.041 --> 22:31.000
<i>You are not the company,</i>
<i>even if the company is you.</i>

22:31.208 --> 22:34.416
<i>Confused yet?</i>
<i>We give this entity a name.</i>

22:34.625 --> 22:35.458
<i>Uh...</i>

22:35.833 --> 22:38.250
<i>"New Century Enterprises," perhaps.</i>

22:38.750 --> 22:41.666
<i>You don't need office space.</i>
<i>You don't need employees.</i>

22:42.083 --> 22:43.625
<i>Exists on paper only.</i>

22:43.833 --> 22:47.375
<i>And what does this company make?</i>
<i>What goods or services does it supply?</i>

22:48.208 --> 22:49.250
<i>Privacy.</i>

22:49.500 --> 22:53.291
<i>It's nothing more than an email address</i>
<i>and a post-office box in a country</i>

22:53.375 --> 22:56.208
<i>where the laws are favorable</i>
<i>to your financial goals.</i>

22:56.500 --> 22:58.708
<i>And where can you find such a country?</i>

22:58.833 --> 23:01.041
<i>Usually in the middle of the ocean.</i>

23:01.541 --> 23:06.000
<i>Maybe the Seychelles</i>
<i>or Cyprus or Tortola or...</i>

23:15.791 --> 23:17.791
I know it's not what you were expecting.

23:19.125 --> 23:21.750
Well, none of this is expected.

23:22.125 --> 23:23.666
Take the money, El.

23:24.375 --> 23:25.625
Sign the release.

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
Joe took really good care of you
with his life insurance.

23:31.500 --> 23:32.833
That and the settlement...

23:33.791 --> 23:35.125
Just take a trip.

23:35.208 --> 23:36.750
-Miss some winter.

23:36.833 --> 23:39.583
Go somewhere that you always wanted.

23:43.291 --> 23:47.458
I mean, the damn insurance company
is the problem here.

23:48.625 --> 23:50.291
You know, I just don't--
I don't understand

23:50.375 --> 23:53.375
how they can just walk away
from any of this.

23:53.458 --> 23:56.708
The United Reinsurance Group of Nevis.

23:57.416 --> 24:00.166
They're the ones gettin' away with murder.

24:01.250 --> 24:03.250
Where in the world is Nevis?

24:03.500 --> 24:05.458
I don't know. Does it matter?

25:33.791 --> 25:34.958
Where's Boncamper?

25:35.041 --> 25:37.875
-Miss, you can't-- Oh, my God!
-Where is he? I want him!

25:39.916 --> 25:41.375
Where's Boncamper?

25:43.333 --> 25:44.458
Where is he?

25:53.250 --> 25:55.750
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Nevis.</i>

25:55.833 --> 25:58.541
<i>The local time is approximately 2:45 p.m.</i>

25:59.166 --> 26:02.250
<i>There is no</i>
<i>Global Property Owners Association,</i>

26:02.458 --> 26:03.916
<i>and there is no Monarch.</i>

26:04.708 --> 26:06.000
<i>Never really was.</i>

26:07.125 --> 26:08.916
How is any of this possible?

26:09.000 --> 26:13.208
Purser backdated the letter to make it
look like he sent it before the accident

26:13.291 --> 26:14.666
so he wouldn't have to pay.

26:15.208 --> 26:16.750
What about United? Um...

26:16.833 --> 26:19.583
-They said United reinsured Monarch.
-No United, either.

26:20.125 --> 26:24.583
It's just a scam that goes from Houston
to the West Indies to Panama

26:24.666 --> 26:26.375
to some bank, who knows where.

26:27.208 --> 26:31.291
Looks like an 18 US code 1343, or 49.

26:33.833 --> 26:35.833
I'm sorry, 1340-what?

26:37.125 --> 26:38.125
Fraud.

26:41.208 --> 26:43.166
All I did wrong was try and save money.

26:46.041 --> 26:48.500
I tried to buy what I needed for less.

26:48.583 --> 26:49.583
That, and I...

26:51.041 --> 26:52.541
I trusted someone in...

26:54.916 --> 26:55.833
Houston.

26:57.208 --> 26:58.708
Is there even a Boncamper?

27:01.708 --> 27:02.708
Oh, yeah.

27:03.750 --> 27:05.083
There's a Boncamper.

27:06.416 --> 27:07.791
How long this time?

27:08.458 --> 27:09.583
Not sure.

27:10.958 --> 27:13.625
Three days. Maybe five.

27:14.458 --> 27:16.083
Clients coming in from Europe.

27:16.458 --> 27:17.416
Oh.

27:17.958 --> 27:19.041
Can I go?

27:19.875 --> 27:21.708
It's not vacation, Rich.

27:23.000 --> 27:27.750
If I bring you, I end up spending all
the money I make on the damn plane ticket.

27:27.833 --> 27:30.083
Come on, Dad, we can go to the uni.

27:31.708 --> 27:34.416
You-- You think I can afford
University Miami?

27:35.000 --> 27:36.750
You go there like every month, no?

27:37.000 --> 27:38.875
Why don't we get an apartment?

27:39.041 --> 27:40.958
In-state tuition is not that much.

27:41.041 --> 27:43.000
Oh, you know about the laws, do you?

27:43.625 --> 27:44.458
Mm?

27:46.625 --> 27:47.541
I do.

27:48.541 --> 27:52.750
I know all the residency laws.
That's what accountants know.

27:52.875 --> 27:55.041
Laws and taxes and banking.

27:55.708 --> 27:56.791
What do you know, eh?

27:57.583 --> 27:58.958
Basketball shoes?

28:01.666 --> 28:03.750
He want to see the world.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.416
Learn more about what you do.

28:07.416 --> 28:09.750
Maybe he can go into business
with you one day.

28:09.916 --> 28:12.291
Let him come along
and watch you at work, Irvin.

28:12.375 --> 28:13.625
Hmph.

28:41.875 --> 28:44.875
Excuse me, sir. Sir? Can you help me?

28:45.333 --> 28:48.958
I'm lookin' for 556 Main Street.

28:49.333 --> 28:51.291
Yeah? The post office, in here.

28:51.375 --> 28:54.833
No, I'm looking
for the United Reinsurance Group,

28:55.375 --> 28:57.625
which is 556 Main Street.

28:58.833 --> 29:00.625
-Un-- United, you say?
-Yeah.

29:00.833 --> 29:02.416
-Mm-hm.
-I-- I-- I-- I think...

29:02.500 --> 29:05.000
I-- I think you must have
written down the wrong address.

29:05.083 --> 29:07.833
No, no, I looked it up.
It's United Reinsurance.

29:07.916 --> 29:12.333
They reinsure, uh, pleasure cruises
and I'm sure other things, but...

29:12.541 --> 29:16.291
I'm actually looking for a man
called Bonca-- Boncamper.

29:19.458 --> 29:20.458
I don't know him.

29:36.333 --> 29:37.541
Daddy!

29:44.625 --> 29:45.708
Mr. Boncamper?

29:47.458 --> 29:48.458
Yes.

29:48.708 --> 29:51.833
Director of
the United Reinsurance Group of Nevis?

29:58.083 --> 30:01.166
Oh, my God, watch your sisters. Excuse me!

30:02.375 --> 30:03.625
Ma'am. Excuse me, ma'am.

30:03.708 --> 30:06.625
-Can you step away?
-I am his goddamn wife. Leave me alone.

30:07.208 --> 30:09.625
-Irvin.
-Vincelle Boncamper?

30:09.708 --> 30:10.666
Edith.

30:11.166 --> 30:14.333
Who the hell is Vincelle?
You people don't even know who he is.

30:14.791 --> 30:15.791
Irvin?

30:17.916 --> 30:19.333
Yeah. Edith?

30:21.666 --> 30:23.833
Can we speak privately for a moment?

30:35.666 --> 30:39.000
This woman, this is Vincelle Boncamper.

30:39.750 --> 30:41.916
-Your husband's other wife.
-What?

30:42.250 --> 30:45.333
Mr. Boncamper has another family.
They live in Nevis.

30:46.583 --> 30:47.958
You motherfucker!

30:48.208 --> 30:51.166
Get your hands off of me! You are dead!

30:51.583 --> 30:52.750
Gimme my kids.

30:54.250 --> 30:56.458
-Let's get him out of here. Let's go.
-Dear?

31:02.791 --> 31:05.833
<i>Final boarding call</i>
<i>for American flight 1307 to Lima,</i>

31:05.916 --> 31:07.833
<i>now departing at gate J-5.</i>

31:15.833 --> 31:17.500
<i>Excuse me. Mr. Mossack?</i>

31:18.083 --> 31:19.125
Yes?

31:19.208 --> 31:21.833
Do you know the name
Malchus Irvin Boncamper?

31:22.708 --> 31:24.125
I'm not sure.

31:24.208 --> 31:25.958
Is it a real name?

31:26.583 --> 31:29.458
Yes, sir. It's a very real name.

31:30.500 --> 31:31.958
How might I know it?

31:32.041 --> 31:33.333
He's from Nevis.

31:33.958 --> 31:35.708
It's a lovely island.

31:36.333 --> 31:38.666
He was arrested
at Miami International Airport.

31:40.541 --> 31:42.291
I think he's going to go to jail.

31:43.583 --> 31:44.625
I see.

31:46.041 --> 31:50.208
Well, maybe you'll tell me how well
do we know Mr. Boncamper?

31:50.291 --> 31:53.625
He's director of 46 different
Mossack Fonseca companies.

31:54.041 --> 31:57.416
The Prague offices use him quite a bit.

31:58.416 --> 32:00.708
Well, we will want to change that.

32:01.291 --> 32:02.875
Change that now?

32:03.791 --> 32:06.791
Can't really go back in time.
He's all over the books.

32:07.416 --> 32:11.666
Well, some people believe
that time is just an illusion.

32:12.458 --> 32:15.333
That all moments are the same moment.

32:16.500 --> 32:20.958
I think it might be bad for us
to do something like that.

32:22.916 --> 32:23.875
Bad?

32:25.625 --> 32:26.791
"Bad" is...

32:27.333 --> 32:29.375
It's such a big word

32:30.291 --> 32:32.375
for being such a small word.

32:33.291 --> 32:34.583
You did-- You did what?

32:34.666 --> 32:40.041
I went to the...  Clark County
Registrar to get the name of the buyer.

32:40.125 --> 32:41.916
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.666
And I found out it's a company.

32:44.500 --> 32:47.083
New Century Enterprises of Panama.

32:47.166 --> 32:48.666
Wait, I thought you said it was Russia.

32:48.750 --> 32:50.750
-Russians with cash.
-No, that's what Hannah told me.

32:50.833 --> 32:53.208
-Hannah who?
-She's the realtor with the tight dresses.

32:53.291 --> 32:57.041
Anyway, I looked up
New Century Enterprises,

32:57.125 --> 33:00.291
and turns out it's controlled by a trust,
something called a trust.

33:00.375 --> 33:02.875
-A trust is like a fiduciary agreement--
-I know what a trust is.

33:02.958 --> 33:05.291
-A third party can-- Okay.
-I know what a trust is, I know--

33:05.375 --> 33:08.750
So the director of both New Century
and the trust...

33:08.833 --> 33:10.125
-...is a woman.

33:10.208 --> 33:12.458
A woman named Mia Beltran.

33:12.541 --> 33:15.583
Mia Bel-- Okay, is that
a name that I should know?

33:15.666 --> 33:19.208
Well, she is obviously very powerful.

33:19.291 --> 33:21.791
She is the director of numerous companies.

33:21.875 --> 33:23.375
-All her companies...

33:23.458 --> 33:26.125
...are registered
to the same law firm,

33:26.208 --> 33:27.208
in Panama.

33:27.291 --> 33:28.833
Mossack and Fonseca.

33:41.541 --> 33:43.375
Our database shows that you are

33:43.458 --> 33:46.333
the director of New Century Enterprises?

33:47.041 --> 33:48.541
I am, sir, yes.

33:48.625 --> 33:51.625
They have purchased multiple properties
in Las Vegas.

33:51.708 --> 33:54.041
I need these signed, immediately.

33:54.916 --> 33:56.666
<i> Moussaka Fusaka?</i>

33:57.375 --> 33:58.375
Oh, wait.

33:58.458 --> 34:01.375
Is that the new goalie for the Red Wings?
Canadian kid?

34:01.458 --> 34:05.875
No, no, no. No. No.
It's not a who. It's a law firm.

34:06.833 --> 34:08.791
In Panama. Okay?

34:08.875 --> 34:12.791
They even have a motto:
"The wealth management you deserve."

34:14.083 --> 34:15.708
I read that. I-- I looked it up.

34:16.166 --> 34:18.500
And our readers need
to know about them why?

34:18.583 --> 34:21.958
As far as I can see,
what they do is they set up companies.

34:22.125 --> 34:25.666
Uh, not real companies
like a hotel or a... hardware store.

34:25.750 --> 34:29.583
They-- They set up, uh, what they call
a "shell", and they sell shells.

34:30.083 --> 34:31.625
Not actual shells.

34:31.708 --> 34:33.583
I'm-- I'm sorry, you lost me. I--

34:34.208 --> 34:38.708
When there's an accident,
like the one that took Joe and Barb,

34:39.541 --> 34:41.791
there's nobody
that we can hold accountable.

34:41.875 --> 34:43.916
There's nobody that we can, uh...

34:44.000 --> 34:47.458
ask questions, and... and...
and find out what happens next, you know?

34:48.000 --> 34:49.041
It's just, uh...

34:50.208 --> 34:51.333
just empty shells.

34:51.708 --> 34:55.125
You see? It's just empty.
It's just shells.

34:55.208 --> 34:57.208
That's the story? Empty shells?

34:57.291 --> 34:59.250
Oh, no, no, the story is somebody died!

34:59.333 --> 35:02.500
And somebody's making money from it,
maybe lots of people.

35:03.833 --> 35:04.875
Right?

35:05.833 --> 35:09.916
That's why we brought it to you.
Somebody has to sound the alarm.

35:10.625 --> 35:13.583
W-- We like to focus on stories
that are closer to home.

35:14.791 --> 35:17.166
Where did you say
this company is located again?

35:19.125 --> 35:20.208
Panama.

35:20.791 --> 35:21.958
Like the hat.

35:29.416 --> 35:31.833
Jesus Christ, fix the goddamn roads. Fuck.

35:31.916 --> 35:34.666
Is it the road or bus
that has to be fixed?

35:34.750 --> 35:35.791
Both.

35:48.250 --> 35:50.208
Seems like we're not going anywhere.

35:50.750 --> 35:51.708
You can get off.

35:53.541 --> 35:54.375
Let's go.

36:24.416 --> 36:27.458
She was the director of 25,000 companies.

36:27.958 --> 36:29.958
-Mia Beltran.
- <i>Scheiße.</i>

36:30.375 --> 36:35.625
Now we need 25,000 forms
changing the director of these companies.

36:36.041 --> 36:39.000
<i>Mossack Fonseca.</i>
<i>How may I direct your call, please?</i>

36:39.458 --> 36:40.625
Oh, hello.

36:40.708 --> 36:43.083
Yes, I would like
to speak with Mr. Mossack, please.

36:43.166 --> 36:44.916
-Spanish.
<i>-Por favor.</i>

36:45.958 --> 36:49.041
No, he is in a meeting now.
Not taking calls.

36:49.416 --> 36:51.375
-He's meeting.
-Ask for the other one.

36:51.458 --> 36:54.750
Um... OK--
May I speak with Mr. Fonseca, please?

36:55.458 --> 36:59.916
He is in a meeting now too. Same meeting.
Maybe if I take a message...

37:00.625 --> 37:02.083
Uh, this is Ellen Martin.

37:02.166 --> 37:04.416
I am the widow of Joe Mart--

37:04.875 --> 37:06.875
<i>-I don't know what kind of outfit...</i>

37:06.958 --> 37:10.125
<i>...those men are running down there,</i>
<i>with all these meetings and what have you,</i>

37:10.208 --> 37:11.375
<i>-but I was--</i>
-Give me a moment.

37:11.458 --> 37:13.333
<i>Okay, you know-- Okay. Here's the message.</i>

37:13.875 --> 37:16.333
Congratulations, Elena.
You've been promoted.

37:16.416 --> 37:17.666
<i>-... pain and suffering...</i>
-What?

37:17.750 --> 37:18.708
-Mm-hm.
-<i>...they cause...</i>

37:18.791 --> 37:21.083
-Oh, my God. I am so sorry, I have to go.
<i>-...in Michigan...</i>

37:21.166 --> 37:22.083
<i>-Hello?</i>

37:22.666 --> 37:24.250
Wow.

37:25.166 --> 37:27.541
-I told you. I told you.
- What?

37:27.833 --> 37:29.375
-They hang up on you.
-Hello?

37:30.708 --> 37:32.250
-They hang up on you.

37:32.916 --> 37:34.791
Okay, let's try again.

37:37.958 --> 37:39.500
Here are some forms.

37:39.583 --> 37:42.500
You just sign on the line.
Your name. Understand?

37:43.333 --> 37:44.916
<i>No... No entiendo.</i>

37:45.000 --> 37:47.041
Sign with your name. Here. That's all.

37:47.125 --> 37:48.708
-All of them?
-Yes, all of them.

37:48.791 --> 37:50.875
But what--
I don't know what it is I'm signing.

37:50.958 --> 37:52.625
They're just some forms.

37:52.708 --> 37:53.833
Just, on each one.

37:53.916 --> 37:54.958
Oh, okay.

37:55.041 --> 37:56.625
-Thank you.
-Okay.

38:10.958 --> 38:15.666
So how did I end up here in Panama?

38:16.166 --> 38:18.875
I don't look Latin to you.

38:18.958 --> 38:22.125
Not like my... my partner, Ramón.

38:22.958 --> 38:26.125
Well, like many Germans,
my father, Erhard,

38:26.208 --> 38:29.333
moved us here after the Second World War.

38:29.916 --> 38:32.458
Er, why? Ah, you may ask.

38:33.250 --> 38:36.291
My, uh, my father taught me the...

38:37.000 --> 38:40.125
the value of, uh, privacy
from an early age.

38:41.375 --> 38:44.083
I was... I was a good student.

38:44.166 --> 38:47.750
I went to law school,
got a job working in a large firm.

38:48.333 --> 38:49.541
I excelled.

38:49.791 --> 38:52.208
But very soon,
I felt like all the other sheep,

38:52.333 --> 38:55.875
uh, every day obediently going to work

38:56.416 --> 38:58.458
and never leaving a mark.

38:59.333 --> 39:01.833
So I started, uh my own firm.

39:02.250 --> 39:06.666
And, uh, one day, I-- I--
I met a very impressive attorney

39:06.750 --> 39:11.500
who had recently left the employ
of the United Nations.

39:16.000 --> 39:20.583
because the Lord hath anointed me
to preach good tidings unto the meek.

39:21.208 --> 39:25.708
He hath sent me
to bind up the brokenhearted,

39:26.166 --> 39:29.166
to proclaim liberty to the captives,

39:29.875 --> 39:32.708
and the opening of the prison to them
that are bound.

39:33.458 --> 39:36.416
Isaiah sixty-one: one.

39:38.750 --> 39:42.791
Father Hector Gallego
said that to me when I was, ah, 16.

39:45.583 --> 39:49.750
The theology of liberation
is what the Catholics called it.

39:51.250 --> 39:52.333
The meek.

39:52.625 --> 39:54.666
They were supposed to inherit the earth.

39:56.375 --> 39:58.708
Doesn't seem it worked out that way to me.

40:00.333 --> 40:04.333
Father Gallego, up there,
was kidnapped and killed by the army

40:04.875 --> 40:06.750
for causing problems in Panama.

40:08.583 --> 40:09.583
He's gone.

40:10.750 --> 40:11.916
But the meek,

40:13.708 --> 40:14.875
they're still around.

40:21.333 --> 40:23.833
So I went to law school instead.

40:24.666 --> 40:27.750
I thought, uh, maybe the meek needed
a better lawyer.

40:28.250 --> 40:32.625
Now, in 1972,
I went to work for the United Nations.

40:32.958 --> 40:35.041
I wanted to save the world.

40:35.791 --> 40:37.083
Saving the world,

40:37.166 --> 40:40.291
as it turns out, is very hard, you know?

40:40.666 --> 40:45.708
Long hours, bad pay, and perhaps
the world does not want to be saved.

40:45.791 --> 40:48.458
Inside all of us,
there are packs of wolves,

40:48.541 --> 40:51.375
some flocks of sheep
roaming through our thoughts.

40:51.458 --> 40:54.333
We want to be fair,
and yet, we want to win.

40:54.708 --> 40:58.000
We want to be righteous,
but we want to get ahead.

40:58.083 --> 41:00.166
-Such is our struggle.

41:00.250 --> 41:02.541
Uh, at some point, you decide

41:03.291 --> 41:05.500
it might just be easier to save yourself.

41:06.250 --> 41:09.791
So, I became a lawyer for the not-so-meek.

41:10.041 --> 41:13.166
And that's about the time
I met Jürgen Mossack.

41:16.000 --> 41:19.125
From our humble beginnings,

41:19.833 --> 41:24.208
Mossack Fonseca grew to have offices
in over 50 countries,

41:25.166 --> 41:31.208
servicing over 240,000 offshore companies,

41:31.625 --> 41:33.916
foundations, and trusts.

41:34.000 --> 41:37.208
Located in places like
the British Virgin Islands,

41:37.291 --> 41:42.000
the Bahamas, Cyprus, Samoa, Nui, Nevada.

41:42.416 --> 41:47.875
Uh, places that are-- are not blessed with
natural resources or industry.

41:47.958 --> 41:50.416
So, what do all of those companies do?

41:50.500 --> 41:53.666
Most of the time, we don't even know.

41:56.541 --> 41:58.333
Excuse me. Mr. Mossack?

41:58.625 --> 41:59.500
Yes?

41:59.583 --> 42:04.291
There is a... There is a company
that we set up in Costa Rica.

42:04.666 --> 42:06.583
-Are you familiar?

42:06.750 --> 42:09.833
It owns a number of assets, real estate.

42:10.208 --> 42:11.333
Mm. And?

42:11.625 --> 42:14.416
Uh, so, yeah, the government of Costa Rica

42:14.500 --> 42:19.333
wants to take back one of the homes
for their Olympic team or...

42:19.625 --> 42:23.166
Has the, uh, beneficial owner
instructed us to do so?

42:23.333 --> 42:26.125
Yeah, the beneficial owner
is a Mexican man.

42:27.500 --> 42:29.541
They say he is in jail.

42:30.625 --> 42:31.625

Yeah, I bet Mum didn't either.

Just head into the house,

48:32.916 --> 48:34.625
-to the back yard.
-Thank you.

48:34.708 --> 48:36.916
-Thank you so much.
-All right, welcome.

48:37.541 --> 48:39.000
Straight to the back yard.

48:39.083 --> 48:40.500
I was not expecting this.

48:40.833 --> 48:42.208
Guys, you have no idea.

48:42.333 --> 48:44.541
-Right?
-Yeah, I'm just dying to meet him.

48:45.541 --> 48:47.875
-Hey, where are you going?
-I'm going back to Africa.

48:47.958 --> 48:51.208
Okay, Marcus Garvey, slow down.
You're not doing that.

48:51.291 --> 48:52.291
Yes, I am.

48:53.416 --> 48:55.666
Your mother's been looking forward to this
for a long time.

48:55.791 --> 48:56.708
Has she?

48:57.166 --> 49:00.916
How long has she been looking forward to
learning you've been banging my roommate?

49:01.541 --> 49:04.458
Her whole life, I bet.
It's like a dream come true.

49:05.916 --> 49:08.166
-I'll meet her at the airport.
-Okay, stop.

49:09.250 --> 49:10.500
Not another word.

49:20.125 --> 49:22.791
You graduate this weekend
from an American university.

49:23.791 --> 49:26.416
How many children from our country
get to come here?

49:27.291 --> 49:31.583
You take your summers in Ibiza.
And Croatia and Monaco, not in a factory.

49:32.250 --> 49:34.541
You have a $100,000 car in the driveway.

49:34.625 --> 49:36.500
You have a job waiting for you
in Cape Town,

49:36.583 --> 49:38.708
or in Paris,
or wherever you want it to be.

49:38.791 --> 49:42.458
Your life, your whole world up
until this moment,

49:42.708 --> 49:44.375
was more or less perfect.

49:45.291 --> 49:47.458
Except for the time
we had to put down your horse

49:47.541 --> 49:49.375
when it fell jumping over a steeple.

49:51.458 --> 49:53.000
This is adulthood.

49:53.875 --> 49:54.791
Welcome.

49:56.208 --> 49:58.750
It's filled with disappointments
and negotiations.

50:01.208 --> 50:02.583
I cannot change the past.

50:04.250 --> 50:07.000
But I am happy to negotiate with you
about the future.

50:08.333 --> 50:09.416
What does that mean?

50:11.416 --> 50:12.416
How much?

50:12.500 --> 50:13.750
Excuse me?

50:14.375 --> 50:16.750
How much money do you want
to go to the party

50:16.833 --> 50:18.875
and not tell your mother about Astrid?

50:18.958 --> 50:20.166
You're kidding.

50:20.333 --> 50:22.583
-Am I? How much?

50:23.500 --> 50:25.791
You go to the party,
you don't tell your mother,

50:25.875 --> 50:27.208
and I continue to see Astrid.

50:27.291 --> 50:30.000
-I'm getting her an apartment in New York.

50:30.083 --> 50:31.750
-This is so fucked up.
-No.

50:31.833 --> 50:33.458
This is how problems are solved.

50:33.833 --> 50:36.916
What's fucked up
is your inability to see that.

50:37.750 --> 50:38.750
How much?

50:42.625 --> 50:43.833
I wanna talk to a lawyer.

50:44.208 --> 50:47.666
Great. Mine's on his way over now.
We can both talk to him.

50:49.375 --> 50:52.666
First of all, congratulations, Simone.
Graduation.

50:52.750 --> 50:53.958
Fuck you, Jeff.

50:56.375 --> 51:00.500
Simone has announced today
that she wants to "ruin me".

51:00.958 --> 51:02.875
Well, as the family lawyer,

51:02.958 --> 51:04.875
I would like to see matters settled

51:04.958 --> 51:06.916
in a way
that is to everyone's satisfaction.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.291
-I know your father feels the same way.
-I do.

51:09.375 --> 51:12.166
Yeah, now, your dad has already
opened up a trust in your name,

51:12.250 --> 51:13.541
so to keep things simple,

51:14.041 --> 51:17.333
this is a further assignment of assets
to that trust.

51:17.416 --> 51:19.208
A graduation present of sorts.

51:20.000 --> 51:21.375
In addition to the party.

51:22.208 --> 51:24.208
-Does that make sense to you?

51:26.833 --> 51:27.666
Hm.

51:27.750 --> 51:29.208
Mum's plane's gonna be early.

51:30.208 --> 51:32.833
Maybe I should go and get her
and we can discuss this all together

51:32.916 --> 51:34.791
like one big, happy family.

51:35.416 --> 51:36.791
There's a company I own.

51:39.375 --> 51:41.291
Whitecloud Enterprises.

51:41.916 --> 51:43.500
I would like to give it to you.

51:44.666 --> 51:47.166
Jeff, tell her what it's worth.

51:47.583 --> 51:50.291
Whitecloud is worth
almost 20 million dollars.

51:50.666 --> 51:53.416
There's a bank account at HSBC in Geneva.

51:54.458 --> 51:57.041
Happy graduation. It's yours.

51:59.958 --> 52:01.333
Mine?

52:02.500 --> 52:04.916
There's probably a board of directors
or something.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.208
Whitecloud is controlled by bearer shares.

52:09.666 --> 52:12.083
Look, my degree is in ethnic identity.

52:12.833 --> 52:16.208
Okay.
So, bearer shares are pieces of paper

52:17.291 --> 52:19.958
that entitle the holder of that paper

52:21.208 --> 52:23.666
to complete control over the company.

52:25.500 --> 52:26.833
You would own the company.

52:27.416 --> 52:29.416
Its money is your money,

52:29.500 --> 52:32.083
as long as you hold the shares.

52:33.291 --> 52:34.958
Right now, I own it.

52:38.750 --> 52:40.541
-Now Jeff owns it.
-Thank you.

52:41.708 --> 52:43.958
If he gives it to you, you would own it.

52:44.375 --> 52:45.375
That simple?

52:48.458 --> 52:49.500
Twenty million?

52:50.125 --> 52:53.125
There's no other paperwork that has
to be done. I'll handle everything.

52:53.208 --> 52:56.416
Just don't lose them.
Put 'em someplace safe.

52:59.458 --> 53:02.875
You get them after the party.
After your mother gets back on a plane.

53:35.958 --> 53:37.208
Good trip, my star?

53:38.208 --> 53:40.666
So where's the guest of honor?
She's been texting.

53:40.875 --> 53:43.000
Really? Anything in particular?

53:43.416 --> 53:44.250
No.

53:44.708 --> 53:45.708
She's in her room.

53:46.625 --> 53:48.750
A little anxious about the day's events.

53:49.208 --> 53:52.000
I prefer the other one better.
The Versace.

53:52.375 --> 53:53.791
It brings out your eyes.

53:53.875 --> 53:55.750
This one brings out things
that make me wonder

53:55.833 --> 53:58.083
why you bothered going to university
in the first place.

53:58.791 --> 54:00.625
Look, I like this one better.

54:00.791 --> 54:03.166
I'm not sure
how your father would feel

54:03.250 --> 54:05.625
about something so revealing
on a young woman.

54:06.708 --> 54:10.416
What is Astrid planning on wearing?
She has a good sense of style, I think.

54:10.500 --> 54:12.125
I don't know what she's wearing.

54:12.208 --> 54:13.583
Is she bringing a date?

54:13.666 --> 54:15.875
The young man we met in St. Barts
over the holidays?

54:15.958 --> 54:17.375
I forget his name, the Italian boy.

54:17.458 --> 54:18.875
Look, she's not coming.

54:18.958 --> 54:20.666
<i>Oh, my God, she must hate me.</i>

54:22.666 --> 54:25.458
It was a shock to her system.
But it's been handled.

54:26.375 --> 54:30.208
I don't want you to worry about it.
I don't want you to worry about anything.

54:31.791 --> 54:33.250
<i>So we're still goin', right?</i>

54:33.333 --> 54:34.666
- Charles?

54:34.750 --> 54:36.375
May I have a word with you?

54:36.458 --> 54:38.125
I'll pick you up after the party.

54:38.583 --> 54:40.250
You're going to love New York.

54:40.625 --> 54:41.625
<i>I'll be ready.</i>

54:42.333 --> 54:43.333
Come.

54:47.291 --> 54:49.708
Do you know what happened
with Simone and Astrid?

54:50.541 --> 54:51.541
Something happened?

54:51.833 --> 54:54.083
I hear Astrid is not coming to the party.

54:54.250 --> 54:55.750
Well, you know young girls.

54:55.833 --> 54:58.333
They can always be counted on
not to be counted on.

54:58.416 --> 55:01.166
They do everything together,
thick as thieves, and now this?

55:01.250 --> 55:02.500
Have you spoken to her?

55:03.166 --> 55:06.416
Intermittently throughout the day.
Has she said anything to you?

55:07.375 --> 55:08.583
Very little to me.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.958
It's probably about a boy.
It usually is.

55:13.166 --> 55:15.000
Have you seen the yard?

55:16.000 --> 55:18.583
It's looking marvelous.

55:23.791 --> 55:24.833
<i>Astrid?</i>

55:25.833 --> 55:27.250
<i>-Uh...</i>
-It's Miranda.

55:27.333 --> 55:28.166
<i>Hi! </i>

55:28.250 --> 55:31.000
<i>I wasn't expecting to hear from you.</i>

55:31.083 --> 55:35.416
Look, I'm not sure what sort of nonsense
has gone on here, but it doesn't matter.

55:35.500 --> 55:38.333
You are part of our family,
part of Simone's life

55:38.416 --> 55:42.166
and this is a moment we are all going to
celebrate together, period.

55:42.791 --> 55:44.708
There is so much love here,

55:44.791 --> 55:48.458
regardless of whatever little injustices
we have visited upon each other,

55:48.541 --> 55:50.250
so you are expected to attend.

55:50.750 --> 55:53.333
Do not ever let a man
destroy your sisterhood.

55:54.125 --> 55:55.541
Do you have a dress to wear?

55:56.166 --> 55:57.750
<i>Uh... Uh, no.</i>

55:58.375 --> 56:00.791
Then you get yourself down
to your favorite store

56:00.875 --> 56:04.250
and buy a dress that says to the world,
"I did it."

56:05.125 --> 56:07.875
That is my graduation present to you.
I will send a car.

56:08.875 --> 56:10.041
<i>You sure it's cool?</i>

56:10.458 --> 56:14.125
It is not merely cool,
it is paramount that you attend.

56:14.458 --> 56:16.416
Just don't tell Simone you're coming,

56:16.500 --> 56:19.583
I want to give her the gift
of her best friend for graduation.

56:20.291 --> 56:22.125
You're amazing.

56:22.333 --> 56:25.125
And just so you know, I don't see this
as a permanent thing, right?

56:25.208 --> 56:26.541
It's just fun for now.

56:26.625 --> 56:29.000
Okay, wonderful. Bye-bye.

56:34.541 --> 56:36.208
Take it off, it's too much.

56:36.291 --> 56:38.416
-Coming from you.
-Coming from your father.

56:38.500 --> 56:39.708
Suck my dick.

56:40.666 --> 56:42.291
Grow up. Now.

56:43.208 --> 56:44.625
You're a very wealthy girl.

56:44.750 --> 56:46.166
Where are my bearer shares?

56:46.875 --> 56:48.125
I'm so out of here.

56:48.208 --> 56:50.333
They're in the safe in my office.

56:50.833 --> 56:52.500
After the party,

56:53.125 --> 56:54.500
once I'm in a car,

56:54.958 --> 56:56.916
I will text you the combination.

56:57.666 --> 56:59.083
And if they're not in there?

56:59.958 --> 57:01.500
Then I'm not a man of my word.

57:02.208 --> 57:07.083
And you will no doubt tell your mother,
and chaos will reign upon the land.

57:08.958 --> 57:10.916
Are you gonna tell her? Ever?

57:12.208 --> 57:13.041
No.

57:14.708 --> 57:17.458
I'm going to protect her
from what would cause her pain.

57:18.916 --> 57:21.041
Because I failed to do that the last time.

57:22.375 --> 57:23.375
What?

57:23.916 --> 57:25.666
She has her own bearer shares.

57:27.000 --> 57:28.125
She's taken care of.

57:29.083 --> 57:31.375
She could leave if she wants,
but she stays.

57:32.625 --> 57:35.000
Why do you think that is?

57:50.250 --> 57:51.291
Hello?

57:54.083 --> 57:55.083
Hello?

57:58.083 --> 57:59.083
Hello?

58:03.208 --> 58:05.250
-Are you fucking kidding me?

58:05.875 --> 58:08.666
You have the audacity
to come back into my house?

58:09.291 --> 58:11.041
-You fucking whore!

58:11.125 --> 58:13.208
What in the Lord's name
is wrong with you, girl?

58:13.291 --> 58:15.916
-She's a fucking slut!
-Is that how you were brought up?

58:16.000 --> 58:18.125
-To raise your hand against a friend?
-Tell her.

58:18.208 --> 58:20.208
-Tell her what you did!
-No matter what she has done,

58:20.291 --> 58:22.333
it cannot possibly warrant this treatment.

58:22.416 --> 58:25.041
You apologize right now, Simone,
or I am going to get your father,

58:25.125 --> 58:26.458
and he will not be so lenient.

58:26.541 --> 58:28.250
-Mum, she--
-You want your father involved?

58:28.333 --> 58:31.041
-Say it, girl. Say you're sorry.
-She doesn't have to.

58:31.375 --> 58:32.750
It's me who should apologize.

58:32.833 --> 58:33.875
Don't be silly.

58:34.083 --> 58:36.375
Over the New Year's, in St. Barts.

58:37.416 --> 58:39.666
I knew he was watchin' me
when I took my clothes off.

58:39.750 --> 58:41.625
I knew he'd follow me into the water.

58:42.166 --> 58:43.625
The-- The Italian boy?

58:44.208 --> 58:45.208
Charles.

58:45.833 --> 58:48.166
I knew when I gave him
my hotel key, he'd come.

58:49.166 --> 58:51.958
He had his foot in between my legs
under the table at dinner.

58:52.375 --> 58:55.333
I thought it would be fun, I didn't
think it would blow up the way it did.

58:55.416 --> 58:56.833
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Simone.

59:03.125 --> 59:04.083
Fuck.

59:07.083 --> 59:08.166
Fuck!

59:16.166 --> 59:18.333
Mm. These certainly are the bearer shares.

59:18.541 --> 59:21.291
-Mm? You own them, you hold them.
- Mm-hm.

59:22.416 --> 59:25.083
Uh, I was told that they're worth
20 million dollars.

59:26.333 --> 59:28.958
Well, well, uh...
looking at the bank statements

59:29.041 --> 59:30.916
you requested from our directors,

59:31.000 --> 59:32.875
Whitecloud Enterprises, uh...

59:33.416 --> 59:37.250
uh, was indeed
worth 20 million US dollars.

59:37.333 --> 59:38.208
Was?

59:38.708 --> 59:41.375
Well, as you can see for yourself, here...

59:41.458 --> 59:48.250
as of last week, they appear to be worth
a little less than $37.

59:48.625 --> 59:51.291
What?

59:55.333 --> 59:57.625
Uh... How is that possible?
It's my company.

59:57.708 --> 59:58.875
Who moved the money?

59:58.958 --> 01:00:01.583
It's true that
you hold the bearer shares

01:00:01.666 --> 01:00:04.375
for Whitecloud Enterprises
of the Seychelles, but...

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.541
Whitecloud itself
is controlled by a trust:

01:00:08.125 --> 01:00:10.083
Jetstream Trust of Cyprus.

01:00:10.458 --> 01:00:11.583
What does that mean?

01:00:11.708 --> 01:00:16.791
So, Jetstream administers to Whitecloud
along with a lot of other companies.

01:00:16.875 --> 01:00:18.625
And, um... what about these?

01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:23.833
These are Nimbus Holdings
of the Seychelles.

01:00:24.416 --> 01:00:28.625
Yeah, also controlled
and held by Jetstream Trust.

01:00:29.208 --> 01:00:33.208
Yeah, the bank says that
Nimbus is now worth,

01:00:33.625 --> 01:00:34.916
uh, $100.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.625
Again, these are recent transactions.

01:00:37.708 --> 01:00:39.708
How the hell does he get away with this?

01:00:40.166 --> 01:00:42.583
Look, where the fuck is my money?

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.291
Well, if you want more information
on your father's financial activities,

01:00:46.375 --> 01:00:49.291
I'm afraid I will have to direct you
toward his bank.

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:51.083
You have to tell us something.

01:00:51.583 --> 01:00:53.958
Actually, I'm not obliged
to tell you anything.

01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:56.958
That... That is the letter of the law.

01:00:59.541 --> 01:01:00.541
Good day.

01:01:05.208 --> 01:01:09.208
I am truly sorry for your trouble.

01:01:09.958 --> 01:01:11.625
I really, really am.

01:01:11.708 --> 01:01:14.916
The world is just men
hiding behind piles of paper.

01:01:15.125 --> 01:01:17.083
Well, fuck him.

01:01:19.625 --> 01:01:21.375
-I'm so sorry.
-Ohh.

01:01:21.458 --> 01:01:22.833
-I'm so sorry.
-Don't worry.

01:01:22.916 --> 01:01:24.166
-Thank you.
-Don't worry.-

01:01:24.666 --> 01:01:25.833
I clean it up.

01:01:28.166 --> 01:01:29.291
I clean it up.

01:01:29.875 --> 01:01:34.000
More than anything else,
our clients expect, uh, one thing from us.

01:01:34.875 --> 01:01:35.833
Privacy.

01:01:35.916 --> 01:01:38.333
Now, privacy and secrecy
are two different things.

01:01:38.416 --> 01:01:41.958
Privacy is locking the bathroom door
when you want to take a pee.

01:01:42.208 --> 01:01:44.541
Secrecy, on the other hand,
is locking the door

01:01:44.625 --> 01:01:48.791
because what you are doing in a bathroom
is not what people usually do.

01:01:49.208 --> 01:01:52.750
And sometimes,
after privacy has had a few drinks,

01:01:53.041 --> 01:01:56.166
it might decide it wants
to spend the night with secrecy

01:01:56.250 --> 01:01:58.750
just to explore the relationship.

01:01:58.958 --> 01:02:03.666
But where can they be together without
people peeking in through the curtains?

01:02:03.791 --> 01:02:05.750
Well, usually, in an offshore company.

01:02:05.833 --> 01:02:09.208
That way, someone looks in a window,
they see an empty room.

01:02:09.333 --> 01:02:13.708
And the window and the room
could be in two different places.

01:02:13.791 --> 01:02:16.166
Yeah, the window could be
in the British Virgin Islands

01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:18.250
and the room could be in, uh--

01:02:18.333 --> 01:02:20.291
China. It goes all the way to China.

01:02:21.250 --> 01:02:24.125
Mel, I found it on the Internet.
They had the whole story.

01:02:24.208 --> 01:02:26.916
Mom, I think you're spending
too much time obsessing on this.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.458
Politicians are doing it.
It's not just criminals.

01:02:29.583 --> 01:02:31.791
Bribery, corruption, money laundering.

01:02:31.875 --> 01:02:34.166
Millions and millions
and millions of dollars.

01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:38.500
And they're tryin' to hide the whole thing
through this company called Russell Prop--

01:02:39.208 --> 01:02:40.583
Yes, Russell Properties.

01:02:57.875 --> 01:03:01.541
<i>So here is another story</i>
<i>Ellen Martin wants to blame on us.</i>

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.458
<i> This man, Mister Maywood,</i>
<i>he is about to make a big mistake.</i>

01:03:07.041 --> 01:03:10.875
<i>Actually, everyone in this story</i>
<i>makes a big mistake.</i>

01:03:11.375 --> 01:03:14.041
<i>But Russell Properties</i>
<i>was not the problem here.</i>

01:03:14.125 --> 01:03:15.541
<i>The problem was greed.</i>

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.833
<i>God passed a law against greed,</i>

01:03:19.583 --> 01:03:22.333
<i>but that didn't stop people</i>
<i>from breaking it.</i>

01:03:22.583 --> 01:03:25.500
<i>And still Ellen Martin thinks</i>
<i>we are responsible</i>

01:03:25.583 --> 01:03:28.208
<i>for this man knocking on the door</i>
<i>of this hotel room.</i>

01:03:35.333 --> 01:03:38.458
I remember you prefer whiskey,
no ice, correct?

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:39.916
Indeed.

01:03:42.416 --> 01:03:46.708
I trust business has been as good
for you as it has been for us here?

01:03:47.833 --> 01:03:51.208
Last year, China became the largest
exporting country on the planet,

01:03:51.958 --> 01:03:53.125
replacing Germany.

01:03:54.833 --> 01:03:55.791
Mm.

01:03:56.208 --> 01:03:59.291
And you also became the largest
automotive market in the world.

01:04:00.250 --> 01:04:01.083
Hats off.

01:04:01.916 --> 01:04:05.875
Every year, we get buried
under more regulations.

01:04:05.958 --> 01:04:09.166
You... You get buried under more dosh.

01:04:10.416 --> 01:04:14.041
My husband is very impressed
with your understanding of the world.

01:04:14.416 --> 01:04:19.000
He says people like you are why
the British controlled China for so long.

01:04:19.083 --> 01:04:21.208
I'll take that as a compliment.

01:04:21.291 --> 01:04:24.458
Well, you should.
My husband's a brilliant man.

01:04:24.541 --> 01:04:27.333
He will likely ascend from his position
on the Politburo

01:04:27.416 --> 01:04:29.750
to become the leader
of all of China one day.

01:04:30.958 --> 01:04:35.166
Now it's time to rinse and repeat.

01:04:36.833 --> 01:04:38.666
To Russell Properties
of the Virgin Islands.

01:04:40.958 --> 01:04:42.875
What shall we call the next one, darling?

01:04:44.208 --> 01:04:46.250
You get me the money,
you can name the entity.

01:04:46.375 --> 01:04:48.583
The deal with Xu Ming was very simple.

01:04:48.666 --> 01:04:51.375
He wanted a plastics factory
here in Chongqing

01:04:51.458 --> 01:04:53.875
and was willing
to pay for the opportunity.

01:04:54.083 --> 01:04:56.041
We wanted a home on the Riviera.

01:04:56.125 --> 01:04:59.250
My husband was able to help Xu
with the factory.

01:04:59.333 --> 01:05:01.458
You were helpful with the home in France.

01:05:02.250 --> 01:05:05.541
You understand the intricacies
of such arrangements,

01:05:05.625 --> 01:05:08.125
these shell companies, as they are called.

01:05:08.208 --> 01:05:09.583
They are so very useful.

01:05:09.833 --> 01:05:13.958
For people in our position,
it can be a fatal illness,

01:05:14.083 --> 01:05:15.708
this accumulation of money.

01:05:15.916 --> 01:05:17.791
I'm nothing more than a white glove,
as you say.

01:05:17.875 --> 01:05:19.416
-Ohh...
-Yes, I am.

01:05:19.833 --> 01:05:21.791
A way to keep your hands
from getting dirty.

01:05:21.875 --> 01:05:25.541
There are many
white gloves in China now.

01:05:25.625 --> 01:05:27.666
You, Mr. Maywood...

01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:29.875
you're more than that.

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:32.708
Your initiative is inspiring.

01:05:34.666 --> 01:05:37.375
For Communists,
you seem to catch on very quickly.

01:05:44.041 --> 01:05:45.625
You never answered my question.

01:05:46.208 --> 01:05:47.750
What question is that?

01:05:49.916 --> 01:05:51.375
Are we moving ahead?

01:05:52.875 --> 01:05:57.291
Or does this bribe you took from Xu
for this damn plastics factory

01:05:58.208 --> 01:06:00.208
become common knowledge to all of China?

01:06:01.041 --> 01:06:03.583
I don't think I have a choice now, do I?

01:06:03.666 --> 01:06:05.875
You are forcing us to commit a crime.

01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:11.833
I'm surprised by the appearance
of such virtue.

01:06:14.125 --> 01:06:16.958
Did you come by that on
your last holiday to France?

01:06:19.125 --> 01:06:21.833
I'm just asking you to do again,

01:06:22.791 --> 01:06:24.083
what you did before.

01:06:26.708 --> 01:06:28.625
Two hundred million US dollars.

01:06:30.791 --> 01:06:33.333
It's not an opportunity
I can just let slide, love.

01:06:33.916 --> 01:06:38.166
Xi Jinping has made it clear that
corruption will no longer be tolerated.

01:06:38.250 --> 01:06:41.208
Are you familiar with Wang Lijun,
the chief of police?

01:06:41.291 --> 01:06:43.541
I try to know
as few policemen as possible.

01:06:44.125 --> 01:06:48.708
Let me tell you a story,
so you can fully understand my concerns.

01:06:50.916 --> 01:06:53.375
Make sure our guest has a drink
for this story.

01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:01.000
<i>You are perhaps familiar</i>

01:07:01.083 --> 01:07:03.875
<i>with the so-called spiritual practice</i>
<i>of Falun Gong.</i>

01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:07.875
<i>It was labeled as an enemy of the state</i>

01:07:07.958 --> 01:07:09.916
<i>for advocating superstition</i>

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.375
<i>and jeopardizing social stability.</i>

01:07:13.166 --> 01:07:18.041
<i>Police Chief Wang decided to help</i>
<i>rid the country of such threats.</i>

01:07:27.416 --> 01:07:31.041
<i>He became feared throughout the land</i>
<i>for the techniques he employed.</i>

01:07:41.833 --> 01:07:44.333
<i>He would say that</i>
<i>the organs were harvested</i>

01:07:44.416 --> 01:07:46.375
<i>only after the prisoners were dead.</i>

01:07:47.666 --> 01:07:50.291
<i>But the Falun Gong were expendable.</i>

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:55.416
<i>And a heart can bring</i>
<i>$180,000 on the open market,</i>

01:07:55.541 --> 01:07:57.625
<i>depending on the blood type.</i>

01:07:58.541 --> 01:08:02.500
<i>A cornea from a young person</i>
<i>is perhaps $3,000.</i>

01:08:02.958 --> 01:08:08.541
<i>A kidney can bring as much as</i>
<i>$60,000, if it is not too old.</i>

01:08:35.375 --> 01:08:38.000
Really charming story. Thanks for sharing.

01:08:39.041 --> 01:08:41.000
Maybe you should lie down for a moment.

01:08:41.125 --> 01:08:42.416
I'm all right.

01:08:44.291 --> 01:08:45.791
So, we are moving ahead?

01:08:45.875 --> 01:08:47.416
Yes, move ahead.

01:08:48.041 --> 01:08:50.791
I'll get the bank to reach out
to Mossack Fonseca in Panama

01:08:50.875 --> 01:08:52.750
and have them set up a new company.

01:08:53.041 --> 01:08:55.125
-In the Virgin Islands.
-Yes.

01:08:55.207 --> 01:08:58.375
And you will promise not to make
any more threats to expose us.

01:08:59.916 --> 01:09:01.957
Why would I expose my trusted partners?

01:09:02.541 --> 01:09:05.375
What can I get you? Aspirin? Water?

01:09:05.666 --> 01:09:06.791
Water's fine.

01:09:08.291 --> 01:09:12.332
So, if we are partners,
will you do something for me?

01:09:12.416 --> 01:09:13.250
Sure.

01:09:13.332 --> 01:09:16.375
I need to know that
there are no others who can hurt me,

01:09:16.457 --> 01:09:19.541
who can expose us,
or I'm always vulnerable.

01:09:21.291 --> 01:09:23.166
I need you to divorce your wife.

01:09:25.082 --> 01:09:29.707
I need you to do that
and prove your loyalty to me and Bo Xilai.

01:09:30.875 --> 01:09:32.125
Will you do that for me?

01:09:33.957 --> 01:09:36.041
-You're fuckin' crazy.

01:09:36.125 --> 01:09:38.082
-Divorce my wife?
-Yes.

01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:41.666
Mm-mm.

01:09:42.291 --> 01:09:44.125
No, I'm not doing that.

01:09:45.207 --> 01:09:46.957
You're just gonna have to trust me.

01:09:50.125 --> 01:09:51.375
Thank you.

01:10:00.458 --> 01:10:01.625
Ah, some more, please.

01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:07.750
I remember you love Mahjong.

01:10:08.416 --> 01:10:13.083
I was thinking we could play a friendly
game and celebrate our new arrangement.

01:10:15.541 --> 01:10:17.000
Maybe we let you sleep.

01:10:18.875 --> 01:10:20.458
-And then we can play.

01:10:22.416 --> 01:10:24.625
Oh, thank you.

01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:48.291
How much longer do we have to wait?

01:11:58.708 --> 01:11:59.708
So...

01:12:01.625 --> 01:12:02.916
What brings you here today?

01:12:04.708 --> 01:12:06.375
Just what I said on the phone.

01:12:07.375 --> 01:12:12.000
This man Maywood has taken our son hostage
at his home in London.

01:12:12.083 --> 01:12:14.375
He tried to force us
into a compromising position

01:12:14.458 --> 01:12:16.541
with various offshore schemes.

01:12:19.625 --> 01:12:21.541
And did you call the authorities?

01:12:23.541 --> 01:12:27.416
He would have spread stories
about me and Bo.

01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:28.916
I have no doubt about that.

01:12:30.125 --> 01:12:32.708
This would have made things
even worse for us.

01:12:35.166 --> 01:12:37.208
So I did what was needed.

01:12:39.208 --> 01:12:40.250
Meaning what?

01:12:45.708 --> 01:12:48.750
In the glasses he drank from,
you will find the residue of rat poison.

01:12:48.833 --> 01:12:51.291
Cyanide stops the heart.

01:12:52.458 --> 01:12:58.750
Along with other things in the room...
you'll understand everything very quickly.

01:13:04.666 --> 01:13:07.541
Everyone sleeps better at night
when corruption has been vanquished.

01:13:27.791 --> 01:13:30.333
That was Gu Kailai on November 14th.

01:13:39.375 --> 01:13:45.208
We will continue to weed out corruption
at every level, no matter how high.

01:13:45.708 --> 01:13:49.166
There is no place in government
for those who are weak

01:13:50.250 --> 01:13:54.708
in the face of temptation.

01:13:55.166 --> 01:13:59.833
On this, Xi Jinping and I agree.

01:14:01.291 --> 01:14:03.250
We must all look in the mirror

01:14:03.333 --> 01:14:06.041
and hold ourselves
to the highest standard,

01:14:10.375 --> 01:14:14.125
as history will not be kind
to those who have stolen from the people.

01:14:20.833 --> 01:14:22.000
We need to get out of here.

01:14:22.083 --> 01:14:23.041
To France.

01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:31.375
Gu Kailai,
you are being arrested for murder.

01:14:31.958 --> 01:14:33.000
Whatever I've done,

01:14:33.083 --> 01:14:35.333
I've done to defend the honor
of my country and my husband.

01:14:35.416 --> 01:14:38.375
Bo Xilai, you are under arrest

01:14:38.458 --> 01:14:42.083
for the crimes of bribery,
embezzlement, and abuse of power.

01:14:42.166 --> 01:14:44.666
What's going on?
You've got the wrong person.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.625
It's a mistake, a mistake.

01:14:48.083 --> 01:14:49.916
<i>So, how is this our fault?</i>

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.958
<i>Did we tell Bo Xilai</i>
<i>and his wife, Madame Gu,</i>

01:14:53.041 --> 01:14:55.833
<i>to accept the bribe</i>
<i>for the plastics factory?</i>

01:14:55.916 --> 01:14:56.791
<i>No.</i>

01:14:56.875 --> 01:14:59.750
<i>Did we tell Mister Maywood</i>
<i>to launder that money</i>

01:14:59.833 --> 01:15:03.250
<i>by purchasing them a mansion</i>
<i>in the south of France?</i>

01:15:03.333 --> 01:15:04.291
<i>No!</i>

01:15:04.375 --> 01:15:08.375
<i>And we most certainly did not</i>
<i>tell Mister Maywood to try and force</i>

01:15:08.458 --> 01:15:12.583
<i>Bo and Madame Gu to launder</i>
<i>still more money</i>

01:15:12.666 --> 01:15:17.000
<i>by accepting more bribes</i>
<i>and starting more entities.</i>

01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:19.958
So where did these ideas come from?

01:15:20.541 --> 01:15:23.916
Where most ideas about money come from.

01:15:24.333 --> 01:15:27.333
The United States of America.

01:15:27.583 --> 01:15:29.458
In the late-19th century,

01:15:29.541 --> 01:15:33.541
the state of Delaware realized
it could not attract business

01:15:33.625 --> 01:15:36.041
the same way New York and New Jersey do.

01:15:36.208 --> 01:15:39.791
So Delaware began writing
corporate-friendly tax laws,

01:15:39.875 --> 01:15:42.250
hoping to lure more business.

01:15:42.333 --> 01:15:43.375
And it worked.

01:15:43.458 --> 01:15:46.625
1209 North Orange Street
in Wilmington, Delaware

01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:51.000
is home to 285,000 companies

01:15:51.333 --> 01:15:54.875
and none of them are paying state taxes.

01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:59.500
The director of this movie has five.

01:16:00.041 --> 01:16:02.708
-Even-- Even our writer has one.

01:16:02.833 --> 01:16:04.875
But if Delaware could do it,

01:16:04.958 --> 01:16:07.875
why couldn't, uh,
Switzerland or Luxembourg,

01:16:07.958 --> 01:16:10.791
and, uh, Hong Kong
and the British Virgin Islands?

01:16:10.875 --> 01:16:13.500
You are probably wondering, is this legal?

01:16:14.375 --> 01:16:15.208
Hm?

01:16:16.083 --> 01:16:19.958
Yes. This is called tax avoidance.

01:16:20.291 --> 01:16:23.166
Now, tax evasion is a crime,

01:16:24.083 --> 01:16:27.583
uh, but tax avoidance,
that's what put us in business.

01:16:27.666 --> 01:16:30.625
And the line between the two,
we like to say,

01:16:30.708 --> 01:16:33.250
it's as thin as a jailhouse wall.

01:16:33.791 --> 01:16:38.875
Now, those very bad things
that have happened to Ellen....

01:16:39.458 --> 01:16:42.000
First, the sinking of the boat, uh...

01:16:42.208 --> 01:16:45.500
-then losing the... the condo in Vegas.
-Yes.

01:16:45.583 --> 01:16:48.166
It's taking a toll on her health.

01:16:48.375 --> 01:16:52.583
Her daughter says she has,
uh, lost appetite,

01:16:52.666 --> 01:16:54.583
uh, she isn't sleeping,

01:16:54.666 --> 01:16:58.291
and the anger she is feeling
is eating her up inside

01:16:58.375 --> 01:17:01.916
because the world is beyond her control.

01:17:02.458 --> 01:17:04.958
She can't afford to make
campaign contributions

01:17:05.041 --> 01:17:08.541
to politicians who could change
the laws that torment her.

01:17:09.541 --> 01:17:13.875
But instead,
she has to come here and pray.

01:17:16.125 --> 01:17:19.250
<i>Thank you, Lord, thank you.</i>
<i>Thank you for everything.</i>

01:17:20.166 --> 01:17:21.291
<i>I hate to ask this,</i>

01:17:21.375 --> 01:17:23.333
<i>but I was just wondering when exactly</i>

01:17:23.416 --> 01:17:26.000
<i>the meek will be inheriting the Earth?</i>

01:17:26.916 --> 01:17:30.416
<i>Wi-- Will that be in my lifetime</i>
<i>or in my grandkids'?</i>

01:17:31.125 --> 01:17:36.583
<i>And-- And the part about the first being</i>
<i>the last and the last shall be first,</i>

01:17:36.666 --> 01:17:38.083
<i>when does that start?</i>

01:17:38.541 --> 01:17:39.416
<i>Hm?</i>

01:17:40.125 --> 01:17:43.041
<i>And what about the rest of us</i>
<i>in the middle, you know?</i>

01:17:43.125 --> 01:17:47.833
<i>We're just falling further and further</i>
<i>and further behind.</i>

01:17:47.916 --> 01:17:49.333
<i>My mother used to say,</i>

01:17:50.250 --> 01:17:52.416
<i>"May lightning strike 'em all</i>
<i>without hitting me."</i>

01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:57.083
<i>Well, aren't you still in charge</i>
<i>of lightning? I know. I know, I know.</i>

01:17:57.166 --> 01:17:59.708
<i>I'm supposed to say,</i>
<i>"Forgive them, Father.</i>

01:17:59.791 --> 01:18:01.208
<i>They know not what they do."</i>

01:18:01.291 --> 01:18:05.875
<i>But I think they do know goddamn well</i>
<i>what they're doing, they just don't care.</i>

01:18:07.291 --> 01:18:11.125
<i>Ah, just... If just one of them</i>
<i>could say, "I'm sorry,"</i>

01:18:11.916 --> 01:18:13.833
<i>you know, and mean it.</i>

01:18:14.375 --> 01:18:16.583
<i>Or go to jail. </i>

01:18:17.208 --> 01:18:20.250
<i>Or both. Yeah. Hey, that would be nice.</i>

01:18:20.333 --> 01:18:21.833
<i>How about both?</i>

01:18:31.625 --> 01:18:33.375
Oh...

01:18:35.166 --> 01:18:36.125
Yeah?

01:19:32.833 --> 01:19:36.083
<i>A lot of it's legal,</i>
<i>but that's exactly the problem.</i>

01:19:37.125 --> 01:19:40.375
<i>It's not that they're breaking the laws,</i>
<i>it's that the laws are so poorly designed</i>

01:19:40.458 --> 01:19:43.083
<i>that they allow people,</i>
<i>if they've got enough lawyers</i>

01:19:43.166 --> 01:19:46.708
<i>and enough accountants,</i>
<i>to wiggle out of responsibilities</i>

01:19:46.791 --> 01:19:50.166
<i>that ordinary citizens</i>
<i>are having to abide by.</i>

01:19:50.250 --> 01:19:54.041
<i>We turn now to the banking bombshell</i>
<i>causing shock waves around the world,</i>

01:19:54.125 --> 01:19:56.000
<i>the so-called "Panama Papers",</i>

01:19:56.083 --> 01:19:58.583
<i>believed to be the biggest data leak</i>
<i>in history.</i>

01:19:58.666 --> 01:20:02.416
<i>Iceland's Prime Minster has stepped down</i>
<i>after being named in the papers.</i>

01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:04.166
<i>Also mentioned in the files,</i>
<i>the late father</i>

01:20:04.250 --> 01:20:05.875
<i>of British Prime Minister David Cameron.</i>

01:20:05.958 --> 01:20:08.750
<i>We just got in this breaking news</i>
<i>from Pakistan. It's an ongoing story.</i>

01:20:08.833 --> 01:20:11.458
<i>Nawaz Sharif,</i>
<i>the Prime Minister, has resigned.</i>

01:20:11.541 --> 01:20:13.958
...fish for it, or did it just appear?

01:20:14.458 --> 01:20:16.875
Uh... I got a message late one night,

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.250
um, and it was from somebody
who called himself Mr. John Doe

01:20:21.625 --> 01:20:23.916
and offered vast amounts of data.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:27.041
<i>And we said yes. So I did not fish for it.</i>

01:20:27.125 --> 01:20:28.833
<i>It just... You know, it just...</i>

01:20:30.416 --> 01:20:32.000
<i>came to us like, uh, fate.</i>

01:20:33.875 --> 01:20:38.833
<i>Uh, we are in the process</i>
<i>of an in-depth investigation</i>

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.916
<i>uh, with experts who have confirmed that,</i>
<i>unfortunately,</i>

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.750
<i>we have been subject</i>
<i>to an unauthorized, uh...</i>

01:20:46.833 --> 01:20:49.083
<i>breach in our email server.</i>

01:20:49.166 --> 01:20:52.750
We are working
with the help of outside consultants

01:20:52.833 --> 01:20:55.791
to determine the extent
to which our system was accessed

01:20:55.875 --> 01:20:58.416
-by unauthorized persons.
-Mm-hm.

01:20:59.291 --> 01:21:01.750
What do we tell our clients?

01:21:03.291 --> 01:21:04.375
Well... uh...

01:21:04.875 --> 01:21:07.458
"We... We regret again any inconvenience

01:21:07.541 --> 01:21:09.833
that this, um...
event may have caused you,

01:21:09.916 --> 01:21:14.500
and, uh, we thank you
for your continued trust and," uh...

01:21:16.916 --> 01:21:18.708
-Yeah.
-Who would have done such a thing?

01:21:19.208 --> 01:21:20.375
Who is John Doe?

01:21:20.458 --> 01:21:22.333
Who, exactly?

01:21:23.666 --> 01:21:26.916
There was a lawsuit in Nevada.

01:21:27.666 --> 01:21:30.208
We were accused of obstruction of justice,

01:21:30.291 --> 01:21:32.708
-but that was never proven.
-Never.

01:21:33.250 --> 01:21:36.833
Maybe our opponent
stole the data to punish us.

01:21:36.916 --> 01:21:39.166
Hm. Then again, maybe...

01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:43.333
maybe it was another law firm,
jealous of our success.

01:21:43.458 --> 01:21:45.666
-Hm.
-Such is the nature of all business.

01:21:45.750 --> 01:21:49.666
Or maybe it was a hacker
who found a backdoor

01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:52.916
to rob us of our reputations
and stole our future.

01:21:53.041 --> 01:21:57.291
An emissary of the meek,
not content to wait for their inheritance.

01:21:57.375 --> 01:22:01.083
Someone who labored under the naive
understanding of the world around them.

01:22:01.166 --> 01:22:05.375
Who blamed us for every, uh, pothole
and collapsing bridge,

01:22:05.458 --> 01:22:09.958
for every, uh, school without books,
for every stomach without food.

01:22:10.041 --> 01:22:12.041
So what did John Doe say about us?

01:22:13.375 --> 01:22:17.041
"More than just a cog in
the machine of 'wealth management',

01:22:17.125 --> 01:22:20.750
Mossack Fonseca
used its influence to write, to--"

01:22:20.916 --> 01:22:26.500
"To... To write and bend laws worldwide
to favor the interests of criminals!"

01:22:26.583 --> 01:22:28.541
-Now, we didn't write the laws!
-Nah.

01:22:28.625 --> 01:22:30.291
-We just wrote contracts.
-Yeah!

01:22:30.375 --> 01:22:33.291
And isn't John Doe the criminal here?
The thief of privacy?

01:22:33.375 --> 01:22:36.625
Twenty-five years of hard work
wiped out in a news cycle!

01:22:36.708 --> 01:22:37.541
Ugh.

01:22:37.625 --> 01:22:41.166
We will be closing our offices
in, uh, Wyoming,

01:22:41.250 --> 01:22:44.291
uh, Gibraltar, and, uh, Jersey.

01:22:44.625 --> 01:22:46.291
In-- In retrospect, uh...

01:22:46.416 --> 01:22:51.125
I think we... we could have
spent more on cyber-security.

01:22:51.458 --> 01:22:53.125
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.916
Fucking British Virgin Islands
want to fine us.

01:22:57.333 --> 01:23:00.458
$440,000. A fine.

01:23:00.541 --> 01:23:03.125
They should be building
a statue of us instead, you know?

01:23:03.208 --> 01:23:06.666
They would be a pile of sand with
a fucking palm tree sticking out of it

01:23:06.750 --> 01:23:07.791
if not for us!

01:23:08.041 --> 01:23:09.375
I'm sorry, I shouldn't--

01:23:10.666 --> 01:23:11.750
Uh, and Niue.

01:23:11.833 --> 01:23:13.208
- Niue.
-Niue.

01:23:13.291 --> 01:23:14.166
-Niue.
-No, uh--

01:23:14.250 --> 01:23:16.416
-Niue would be nothing without us.
-Nothing.

01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:19.166
- We put Niue on the goddamn map!
- We did.

01:23:19.250 --> 01:23:21.875
There is someone on the phone
who is asking questions

01:23:21.958 --> 01:23:24.208
about something called "Odebrecht".

01:23:35.916 --> 01:23:38.416
Who sent you? John Doe?

01:23:39.083 --> 01:23:41.166
Are you John Doe's police force?

01:23:41.250 --> 01:23:43.250
We are here
because President Varela believes

01:23:43.333 --> 01:23:45.291
you have knowledge
about Odebrecht.

01:23:45.625 --> 01:23:46.625
Odebrecht?

01:23:46.708 --> 01:23:49.958
A Brazilian construction company that
has paid out over three billion dollars

01:23:50.041 --> 01:23:51.708
in bribes to officials
all around the world

01:23:51.791 --> 01:23:55.208
in order to secure giant contracts
in more than a dozen countries.

01:23:55.333 --> 01:23:57.833
And-- And what does that have
to do with my garden?

01:24:01.166 --> 01:24:04.625
There are dozens of shell companies
your firm created for Odebrecht

01:24:04.708 --> 01:24:05.958
to launder bribes.

01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:08.791
Companies in Nevada,
in the British Virgin Islands.

01:24:08.875 --> 01:24:12.166
No, no, no, no. We sold those companies
to intermediaries.

01:24:12.250 --> 01:24:15.708
Uh... We-- We had no knowledge of
what the money was used for!

01:24:15.791 --> 01:24:16.666
Mm.

01:24:16.791 --> 01:24:18.083
Why don't I believe you?

01:24:18.208 --> 01:24:19.291
Oh, I know why.

01:24:19.375 --> 01:24:22.166
Europol says nearly 3,500 individuals

01:24:22.250 --> 01:24:24.416
with companies your firm created

01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:26.375
are connected to suspected criminals.

01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:27.458
That's why.

01:24:28.250 --> 01:24:29.250
Get him out of here.

01:24:29.333 --> 01:24:31.958
So what?
Do you want to know about Odebrecht?

01:24:32.041 --> 01:24:33.833
-That's why we're here.
-You know what? Listen.

01:24:33.916 --> 01:24:37.875
The highway most of you took to get here
this morning was built by Odebrecht.

01:24:38.583 --> 01:24:42.500
You know, they actually have a department
of their company in charge of bribes.

01:24:42.583 --> 01:24:43.958
-Is that my fault?

01:24:44.041 --> 01:24:46.375
They have paid over three billion dollars

01:24:46.458 --> 01:24:48.375
-in bribes to secure...
-No, Ramón, that's enough.

01:24:48.458 --> 01:24:50.500
...construction contracts
all over the world.

01:24:50.583 --> 01:24:53.875
And I have every reason to believe that
President Varela of Panama himself

01:24:53.958 --> 01:24:56.500
has accepted campaign contributions
from Odebrecht!

01:24:56.583 --> 01:24:58.875
-What? Do you have proof of this?
-No, Ramón--

01:24:58.958 --> 01:25:02.291
May I be struck down by lightning
if I am lying.

01:25:02.416 --> 01:25:04.166
-Who's John Doe?
-All right? No, no.

01:25:04.250 --> 01:25:07.083
President Varela has not defended Panama.

01:25:07.166 --> 01:25:10.583
We have dropped our pants
before the international community,

01:25:10.666 --> 01:25:12.750
and they are all lining up behind us now.

01:25:12.833 --> 01:25:14.291
-Enough!
-Who is Joe Doe?

01:25:14.375 --> 01:25:17.541
I don't-- I don't know who John Doe is!
Fuck John Doe!

01:25:21.208 --> 01:25:26.833
I think Ramón wishes he had not said
some of the things he said that day

01:25:26.916 --> 01:25:28.583
about our president.

01:25:30.958 --> 01:25:33.833
These are the kinds of wishes
that men have

01:25:34.750 --> 01:25:37.000
when they are sitting in jail.

01:25:38.958 --> 01:25:40.166
Father Gallego.

01:25:42.083 --> 01:25:45.708
Maybe he was a saint
and there was no room for him on Earth,

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.958
so he was, uh... moved to Heaven.

01:25:50.791 --> 01:25:53.750
Yeah, but there was plenty of room
for Jürgen and I.

01:25:54.583 --> 01:25:58.625
Room for us to keep 215,000 secrets.

01:26:00.291 --> 01:26:01.291
What?

01:26:02.041 --> 01:26:04.375
You wanna go back to bananas?

01:26:05.541 --> 01:26:07.541
-Yeah.

01:26:26.333 --> 01:26:28.083
So, if we are the losers,

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.416
then who are the winners?

01:26:33.416 --> 01:26:34.416
The meek?

01:26:35.666 --> 01:26:37.000
Children who need books?

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.625
The poor who need homes?

01:26:41.583 --> 01:26:42.625
No.

01:26:43.916 --> 01:26:45.708
The United States.

01:26:46.333 --> 01:26:49.500
The biggest tax haven in the world.

01:26:51.166 --> 01:26:52.458
Delaware.

01:26:53.583 --> 01:26:54.833
Nevada.

01:26:56.250 --> 01:26:57.416
Wyoming.

01:26:59.083 --> 01:27:01.916
How much due diligence is happening there?

01:27:03.041 --> 01:27:07.208
Yes, there is a--
a brand new tax law in America.

01:27:08.083 --> 01:27:11.750
And it does nothing to stop any of this.

01:27:13.291 --> 01:27:14.250
Huh.

01:27:16.750 --> 01:27:19.291
Is John Doe on his way there?

01:27:25.916 --> 01:27:27.000
Well, uh...

01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:29.083
We thank you, uh...

01:27:29.166 --> 01:27:32.000
for listening to our side of the story.

01:27:32.916 --> 01:27:35.125
Mossack Fonseca... uh...

01:27:36.291 --> 01:27:37.333
is no more.

01:27:37.875 --> 01:27:41.375
But there are many other firms
just like us.

01:27:41.833 --> 01:27:45.666
Yeah.
Still in business all around the world.

01:27:45.958 --> 01:27:49.125
And what does John Doe
have to say about that?

01:27:49.666 --> 01:27:50.875
Whoever that is.

01:27:51.541 --> 01:27:56.125
I do not work for any government
or intelligence agency, I never have.

01:27:57.208 --> 01:28:00.208
My viewpoint is entirely my own,

01:28:01.083 --> 01:28:04.083
as was my decision to share the documents.

01:28:04.708 --> 01:28:07.125
I call on the European Commission

01:28:07.916 --> 01:28:09.708
and the British Parliament,

01:28:10.291 --> 01:28:12.208
the United States Congress,

01:28:12.750 --> 01:28:14.458
and all nations

01:28:14.958 --> 01:28:19.333
to put an end to massive, pervasive...

01:28:19.666 --> 01:28:21.041
...corruption!

01:28:26.333 --> 01:28:28.291
In this system, our system,

01:28:29.458 --> 01:28:31.166
the slaves are unaware,

01:28:31.250 --> 01:28:34.458
both of their status and of their masters,

01:28:34.541 --> 01:28:36.541
who exist in a world apart

01:28:36.625 --> 01:28:41.583
and where the shackles are hidden
amidst reams of...

01:28:42.500 --> 01:28:43.916
unreachable legalese.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.291
It is a result of massive, pervasive
corruption of the legal profession.

01:28:48.625 --> 01:28:52.500
When it takes a whistleblower
to sound the alarm,

01:28:52.583 --> 01:28:54.666
it is cause for even greater concern.

01:28:55.708 --> 01:28:58.000
'Cause it signals that...

01:28:58.083 --> 01:29:01.958
...democracy's checks
and balances have all failed,

01:29:02.666 --> 01:29:06.125
and that severe...

01:29:08.333 --> 01:29:11.125
...instability could be just...

01:29:15.333 --> 01:29:17.250
just around the corner.

01:29:19.708 --> 01:29:22.333
So... now...

01:29:23.208 --> 01:29:24.416
is the time...

01:29:25.250 --> 01:29:26.416
for real action.

01:29:28.041 --> 01:29:30.583
It starts with asking questions.

01:29:31.375 --> 01:29:36.291
Tax evasion cannot possibly be fixed...

01:29:36.625 --> 01:29:40.000
while elected officials
are pleading for money

01:29:40.083 --> 01:29:42.375
from the very elites

01:29:43.916 --> 01:29:46.416
who have
the strongest incentives to avoid taxes...

01:29:47.291 --> 01:29:49.791
relative to any other segment
of the population.

01:29:51.208 --> 01:29:52.125
Yeah.

01:29:52.208 --> 01:29:53.083
These...

01:29:54.916 --> 01:29:57.541
political practices
have come full circle

01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.666
and are irreconcilable.

01:30:03.875 --> 01:30:05.041
Reform...

01:30:06.375 --> 01:30:12.541
of America's broken campaign
finance system cannot wait.
