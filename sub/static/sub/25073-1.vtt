01:38.037 --> 01:40.170

01:52.953 --> 01:56.386

03:27.179 --> 03:29.115

05:50.089 --> 05:53.693
Oh yeah...
Chicks are going to dig you.

06:12.077 --> 06:16.180
So what you want
to do is mix your dough thoroughly

06:16.182 --> 06:19.784
otherwise your cookies
just wont be moist.

06:19.786 --> 06:24.022
Cause no one
likes an un-moist cookie.

06:24.024 --> 06:30.464
After you are done mixing
and you have added your nuts...

07:22.781 --> 07:25.118
Stay there Roxy.

09:59.405 --> 10:07.381

Yeah. Yeah, you do that.

21:44.276 --> 21:47.980

22:57.315 --> 23:00.149

23:00.151 --> 23:03.155
Just three clicks south of
Cooper's Mill...

23:04.155 --> 23:05.589
Maxine!

23:05.591 --> 23:08.661
Shut up and do it would ya?

23:09.761 --> 23:12.264
And bring some damn
clothes while you're at it...

23:14.600 --> 23:17.734
Because I'm standing in the
middle of the road in my damn

23:17.736 --> 23:21.537
skivvies!
Maxine, that's why!

23:21.539 --> 23:25.143

23:28.046 --> 23:31.049
Geeez Louise! That lady

25:50.455 --> 25:52.458

26:06.470 --> 26:09.208

27:12.804 --> 27:15.438
SECURITY GUARD

27:19.944 --> 27:21.613

27:27.853 --> 27:29.986

27:31.456 --> 27:34.924
AHH! AHHH!

28:24.508 --> 28:26.511

28:49.066 --> 28:58.076
Is everybody OK?
I'll be right back.

28:59.111 --> 29:08.083
Is everybody OK?
I'll be right back.

30:14.686 --> 30:16.088
Son of a...

30:26.998 --> 30:29.701
K, This is case 7638.

30:49.086 --> 30:50.823
Well you've had better
days there ay buddy.

30:53.123 --> 30:56.258
K, We've got a male,
approximately 45 to 50

30:56.260 --> 30:59.528
years of age.

30:59.530 --> 31:01.767
Struck by a vehicle.

31:03.168 --> 31:06.636
A bus to be more precise and
pronounced dead at the scene

31:06.638 --> 31:09.642
by paramedics.

31:39.203 --> 31:45.174
K, there is significant blunt
force trauma to the head,

31:45.176 --> 31:48.514
the right upper thoracic,
the right mid torso...

31:53.317 --> 31:56.555
and this is consistent with
this type of vehicular accident.

32:00.325 --> 32:02.158
K...

32:02.160 --> 32:05.163
It appears the large and small
intestines are visible from...

32:06.831 --> 32:11.234
the outside of the body.

32:11.236 --> 32:12.701
And this is due to the large

32:12.703 --> 32:15.705
laceration to the
lower abdomen area.

32:15.707 --> 32:19.178
K, moving on to the
posterior examination...

32:25.816 --> 32:27.819
Jesus!!!

33:05.356 --> 33:10.328
It appears to be
some sort of... parasite.

33:11.261 --> 33:15.900
It's nothing I've ever seen or
any clue what it may be...

33:35.186 --> 33:39.658
I'm gonna try removing it
from the subjects neck.

34:02.913 --> 34:08.184
Ugh! Aagh!

34:08.186 --> 34:13.192
CORONER

39:24.167 --> 39:26.171
Get off of her!

40:18.522 --> 40:20.755
Hey!

40:20.757 --> 40:22.761
Don't you move!

40:24.227 --> 40:25.527
Put your hands in the air

40:25.529 --> 40:28.696
and lace your fingers
behind your head

40:28.698 --> 40:31.068
Do it!

42:41.665 --> 42:43.799
What was I just saying
about the universe providing?

42:43.801 --> 42:45.701
You are right
man what can I say?

42:45.703 --> 42:48.672
Tell her how much you
like blondes... love them.

42:50.741 --> 42:54.442
Who are you
supposed to be sweetheart?

42:54.444 --> 42:56.812
I don't know what look
you're going for there but ah...

42:56.814 --> 42:59.817

44:32.576 --> 44:36.377

46:47.611 --> 46:50.448
Yeah, yeah, yeah... No, shit.

48:26.544 --> 48:27.609
Ahhh!

49:23.366 --> 49:28.036

49:28.038 --> 49:30.237
Oh my God.
This is isn't happening.

49:30.239 --> 49:34.141
This isn't happening.
Okay... Okay.

49:34.143 --> 49:37.781
Calm down... breathe.

49:41.718 --> 49:43.787
What the hell's
going on in there?!

49:44.053 --> 49:47.321
Oh shit!

49:47.323 --> 49:49.324
I saw you come home
and I know you're in there.

49:49.326 --> 49:51.659

49:51.661 --> 49:55.230

49:55.232 --> 49:58.199

while you're at it!

49:58.201 --> 50:00.203
Can you hear me?!

50:02.071 --> 50:03.839
Open the damn door!

50:03.841 --> 50:07.208
Between all the noise and
your rent once again being late

50:07.210 --> 50:09.678
you're really starting to try
my patience.

50:09.680 --> 50:11.346
Not to mention piss me off!

50:11.348 --> 50:12.346
Ugh!

50:12.348 --> 50:13.348

50:14.718 --> 50:18.152
