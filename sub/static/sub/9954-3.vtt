00:01.043 --> 00:03.659
Pre vious/y on "Ha ven". ..

00:04.213 --> 00:06.875
If I go into that barn
and the hunter meteor storm hits,

00:07.008 --> 00:07.997
troubles disappear.

00:08.134 --> 00:09.874
For 27 years, they're gone.

00:10.011 --> 00:12.172
I am gonna die
before I let you go.

00:13.055 --> 00:14.556
She's trying to help this town.

00:15.433 --> 00:16.513
Audrey, stop!

00:18.603 --> 00:20.013
Go! Save her!

00:22.064 --> 00:23.645
Duke, we all thought
you were dead.

00:23.774 --> 00:26.356
This is Jennifer. She's troubled ——
connected to the barn somehow.

00:26.485 --> 00:27.941
She heard Audrey talking.

00:28.070 --> 00:30.277
By killing the person
she loves the most,

00:30.406 --> 00:32.112
she could end the troubles forever.

00:32.241 --> 00:33.617
To my little brother,
Duke Crocker.

00:33.743 --> 00:35.825
He's taken me in,
given me a home.

00:35.953 --> 00:38.569
The Guard doesn't want
another Crocker in town

00:38.706 --> 00:40.071
taking over the family business.

00:40.208 --> 00:41.994
He doesn't know anything
about that stuff.

00:42.126 --> 00:43.491
Well, how can you be so sure?

00:43.628 --> 00:45.209
He might have found
your father's journal.

00:45.338 --> 00:46.498
No. It's all hidden.

00:46.631 --> 00:49.873
Are you going to get Wade
out of Haven?

00:50.009 --> 00:51.419
You're not just a bartender.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.508
I need you to remember
who you were.

00:53.638 --> 00:55.879
It's time for you to tell me
who you think I really am.

00:56.015 --> 00:57.846
Well, I know who you are.

00:57.975 --> 01:03.060
But if I tell you,
there's no turning back.

01:33.636 --> 01:36.343
Oh, geez.

01:44.981 --> 01:47.347
Damn ancient wiring.

01:54.323 --> 01:56.029
[Thud]

02:01.414 --> 02:02.995
Can't wait to go digital.

02:07.670 --> 02:08.500
[Screams]

02:15.261 --> 02:16.376
[Knocking]

02:16.512 --> 02:17.342
Come in.

02:18.180 --> 02:19.215
Close the door behind you.

02:19.348 --> 02:20.724
We came as fast as we could.

02:20.850 --> 02:23.557
He ran a traffic light
to get us here.

02:23.686 --> 02:25.893
Slowing down on a yellow
is just a matter of taste.

02:26.022 --> 02:27.762
Not in my Montclair it isn't.

02:28.858 --> 02:31.816
Dwight, what is it?

02:31.944 --> 02:33.559
I need you two
to go to new Hampshire.

02:33.696 --> 02:35.232
One of Nathan's contacts
found a body

02:35.364 --> 02:36.865
matching Audrey's description.

02:36.991 --> 02:38.401
You intercepted Nathan's fax.

02:38.534 --> 02:39.740
It came in last last night.

02:39.869 --> 02:41.530
The body was found in a forest
six months ago.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.072
She's been on ice ever since.

02:43.205 --> 02:45.241
ID. has to be in person.

02:46.709 --> 02:47.869
We need to be sure.

02:48.002 --> 02:49.583
Before you tell Nathan.

02:49.712 --> 02:51.168
And before you tell The Guard.

02:51.297 --> 02:53.538
If that poor girl's gone,

02:53.674 --> 02:55.665
so is our only chance
to get rid of the troubles.

02:55.801 --> 02:56.881
lf Audrey Parker is dead,

02:57.011 --> 02:58.922
a lot of people
will be out for Nathan's head.

02:59.055 --> 03:01.671
And I don't know
if I can stand in their way.

03:01.807 --> 03:04.890
—Now, see here, Vince ——
—Not now.

03:05.019 --> 03:06.304
l'm trusting you two with this.

03:06.437 --> 03:09.554
Just make the |.D., either way.

03:14.070 --> 03:16.402
And guys...

03:17.281 --> 03:18.737
If it is Audrey...

03:23.746 --> 03:25.156
...bring her home.

03:29.752 --> 03:33.119
Tell me, if I'm not a bartender,
then who the hell am I?

03:33.255 --> 03:36.167
What am I?
Some kind of, like, secret agent?

03:36.300 --> 03:38.131
Is that my job in Haven?

03:38.260 --> 03:39.966
Huh? Is that what
I'm supposed to remember?

03:40.096 --> 03:42.758
It's not just remembering
who you were.

03:42.890 --> 03:45.131
You need to know where you are.

03:45.267 --> 03:47.428
Why don't you just tell me?

03:49.522 --> 03:50.762
You're not ready.

03:55.444 --> 03:56.308
Up.

03:56.445 --> 03:57.480
Move.

03:57.613 --> 03:58.568
Out!

03:59.824 --> 04:01.314
You're right.
I'm not just a bartender.

04:01.450 --> 04:03.827
I'm a bartender with a gun
who's tired of your riddles.

04:03.953 --> 04:08.162
So you have one last chance
to give me a straight answer.

04:34.316 --> 04:36.022
Did I miss anything good?

04:36.152 --> 04:37.858
What's with the pocket rocket?

04:38.571 --> 04:40.812
I'll put it in the lock box.
I'll tell you about it later.

04:42.158 --> 04:46.026
Tell me about it after | service
the cutie at the end of the bar.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.659
What's wrong, honey?
You look like you seen a ghost.

04:56.589 --> 04:59.547
Maybe I have.

05:06.849 --> 05:08.385
Start having Jennifer
walk you through

05:08.517 --> 05:11.759
everything she heard going on
in the barn before it imploded.

05:12.188 --> 05:14.224
I keep thinking Howard
must have said something

05:14.356 --> 05:16.392
that'll tell us where the barn
was sending Audrey next.

05:16.525 --> 05:18.061
You think she's gonna
remember more

05:18.194 --> 05:21.027
now that she's 100% organic
and psych—meds free?

05:21.155 --> 05:22.440
Thank you.

05:23.741 --> 05:25.322
Right now she's all we got.

05:26.035 --> 05:27.696
We got a call.

05:27.828 --> 05:31.036
—|'|| be there as soon as I can.
—Yeah.

05:37.463 --> 05:39.078
—Excuse me.
—What?

05:43.511 --> 05:45.422
You get one.

05:45.554 --> 05:47.340
Nathan, that call we got ——

05:47.473 --> 05:49.429
It's about a city worker.
He never checked in.

05:49.558 --> 05:52.265
—Supervisor found him in the sewer.
—Sleeping on the job?

05:52.394 --> 05:55.056
Dead.
Likely a trouble.

06:03.656 --> 06:05.521
Know how the victim died?

06:05.658 --> 06:08.775
ME. said the body's
completely drained of blood.

06:11.580 --> 06:13.445
Drained of blood?

06:13.582 --> 06:15.538
Was he cut?
Any puncture wounds?

06:15.668 --> 06:16.953
Not that anyone found.

06:18.254 --> 06:19.619
How is that possible?

06:19.755 --> 06:22.121
I don't think it is...
unless you believe in vampires.

06:22.258 --> 06:23.964
[Cell phone rings]

06:24.593 --> 06:26.754
[Phone beeps]
Yeah?

06:28.472 --> 06:30.178
Seriously?

06:30.307 --> 06:31.558
[Phone beeps]

06:31.684 --> 06:34.266
We've got a second drained body.

06:35.896 --> 06:40.435
[Somber folk music]

07:08.971 --> 07:11.303
I don't remember that man, Howard,
saying anything

07:11.432 --> 07:12.842
about where Audrey was going next.

07:12.975 --> 07:16.513
I do remember you, though,
desperately calling her name,

07:16.645 --> 07:18.681
like you never wanted to lose her.

07:21.817 --> 07:23.148
She was, uh...

07:24.653 --> 07:26.189
...special to me.

07:27.156 --> 07:29.488
"Was"?

07:29.617 --> 07:30.948
Do you think she's dead?

07:34.204 --> 07:36.741
I don't want her to be.

07:40.419 --> 07:41.750
Here you go.

07:41.879 --> 07:44.120
Thank you.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.842
Mm.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.552
[Caribbean accent] Remind me
of a sunset in port of Spain.

07:52.681 --> 07:54.182
Just a little thank—you
for letting me stay upstairs

07:54.308 --> 07:56.173
in Audrey's apartment.

07:56.310 --> 07:58.722
[Normal voice]
Well, she wouldn't mind.

07:58.854 --> 08:00.139
She'd like you.

08:03.651 --> 08:05.232
So, how are you feeling?

08:05.361 --> 08:07.192
Any side effects?

08:08.572 --> 08:09.903
From going off my meds?

08:10.032 --> 08:11.647
No.

08:11.784 --> 08:13.740
I actually feel pretty great.

08:13.869 --> 08:15.905
Except that you're not sleeping.

08:16.038 --> 08:17.744
How come?

08:19.625 --> 08:21.081
I don't want to narc.

08:23.128 --> 08:26.370
It's my bar.
Narc.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.256
Your brother Wade
is really enjoying

08:29.385 --> 08:31.250
his new "it's complicated"
martial status.

08:31.387 --> 08:33.969
He's turned this place
into an after—hours party shack,

08:34.098 --> 08:36.134
and it gets loud...late.

08:36.266 --> 08:37.927
Yeah, well, that's my brother.

08:38.060 --> 08:39.220
Wall Street Wade ——

08:39.353 --> 08:42.641
work hard, party hard, be annoying.

08:42.773 --> 08:44.764
He really needs to get out of here
for his own good.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.265
Well, can't you just tell him that?

08:46.402 --> 08:47.938
He's like an African honey badger.

08:48.070 --> 08:51.028
I mean, the more you try
to get rid of him, the more he just...

08:51.156 --> 08:52.441
digs in.

08:52.574 --> 08:54.610
Been watching "Animal Planet"
again, huh?

08:54.743 --> 08:55.607
Ow.

09:01.250 --> 09:02.080
[Clears throat]

09:03.836 --> 09:06.373
What? So you can watch
a lion mangle an impala,

09:06.505 --> 09:09.247
but you're scared of a little cut?

09:10.342 --> 09:12.754
No, l—l—l, uh...

09:13.721 --> 09:16.133
| just have a thing for, um...

09:17.808 --> 09:20.265
...ladies who are hurt.

09:20.394 --> 09:21.804
It breaks my heart.

09:21.937 --> 09:24.599
I'm gonna get you
a Band—Aid, okay?

09:32.531 --> 09:34.317
Hey.

09:35.117 --> 09:37.608
It looks like Jordan's
going on dead man's watch.

09:39.413 --> 09:41.324
I can talk to Vince about that.

09:41.457 --> 09:42.287
No, | get it.

09:42.416 --> 09:44.498
It doesn't make sense for me
to die on the job

09:44.626 --> 09:46.241
before we find Audrey.

09:46.378 --> 09:47.879
Make it count for something.

09:48.005 --> 09:50.462
I'm starting to like
your vampire theory.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.707
How do you know
Audrey will do it ——

09:52.843 --> 09:54.174
kill you to end the troubles?

09:54.303 --> 09:55.543
I mean, she didn't do it last time.

09:58.974 --> 10:00.680
I didn't know about it last time.

10:00.809 --> 10:03.141
I'm gonna tell her to.

10:04.146 --> 10:06.558
Body was found right here
beside that manhole cover.

10:06.690 --> 10:09.978
Maybe the killer was trying
to stuff his body down the sewer?

10:10.110 --> 10:12.522
Or the killer came
out of the sewer to get him.

10:12.654 --> 10:14.110
You think the killer
lives down there?

10:14.239 --> 10:15.194
Well, it makes sense.

10:15.324 --> 10:18.066
Two bloodless bodies
found in and around sewers.

10:18.202 --> 10:19.408
I'll have to check the maps.

10:19.536 --> 10:21.868
I think this is the same line
that runs under 4th Street.

10:21.997 --> 10:23.498
Where we found the other victim.

10:39.264 --> 10:40.344
Hair of the dog.

10:41.683 --> 10:43.548
How did you know?

10:43.685 --> 10:46.472
I hear you've been partying it up.

10:48.190 --> 10:49.726
Mm.

10:49.858 --> 10:52.474
You know, I've been thinking.

10:52.611 --> 10:54.351
You can make a lot of extra bank

10:54.488 --> 10:56.479
by keeping this place open
after hours.

10:56.615 --> 10:59.402
All right, let's get
one thing straight.

10:59.535 --> 11:02.527
This is my bar, my schedule.

11:02.663 --> 11:03.903
Well, now that I'm staying here,

11:04.039 --> 11:07.497
l was kind of thinking that,
you know, this was our bar.

11:07.626 --> 11:09.787
I did care of it for six months.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.035
Well, it isn't.

11:11.630 --> 11:14.963
Look, don't you have a job
back in New York?

11:15.092 --> 11:16.673
I thought you said
I was welcome here.

11:16.802 --> 11:19.134
Dad taught me to share.
I guess you missed the lesson.

11:19.263 --> 11:20.093
You know what, Wade?

11:20.222 --> 11:21.678
You don't want any part
of what Dad taught me.

11:21.807 --> 11:25.925
Yeah, well, at least he came home
to you at night, raised you.

11:26.061 --> 11:26.766
If you want to call it that.

11:26.895 --> 11:29.102
Don't bad—mouth a man
who's not here to defend himself.

11:29.231 --> 11:29.936
Okay, you know what?

11:30.065 --> 11:33.102
Wade, you are not gonna work out
your daddy issues

11:33.235 --> 11:35.066
by piggybacking on my life.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.402
You understand?

11:37.990 --> 11:39.605
Now, you need to go back
to New York,

11:39.741 --> 11:42.198
find a therapist
with a nice, comfy couch.

11:42.327 --> 11:44.943
Why are you in such a hurry
to have me leave Haven?

11:47.666 --> 11:49.281
Are you working on a scheme?

11:50.252 --> 11:52.288
Maybe I can help you.

11:52.421 --> 11:54.286
Divorces aren't cheap.

11:54.423 --> 11:57.256
You wouldn't be interested
in anything I'm a part of.

12:00.971 --> 12:04.338
| just think I'm used to doing
my own thing.

12:05.100 --> 12:07.182
You know, maybe ——

12:07.311 --> 12:10.644
maybe Crockers aren't supposed
to live together...

12:10.772 --> 12:12.228
like rhinos.

12:13.150 --> 12:14.185
Rhinos?

12:17.905 --> 12:19.816
I'll tell everyone to stay away
from the sewer drains,

12:19.948 --> 12:22.815
that there was a toxic spill
at the aluminum plant outside town.

12:22.951 --> 12:24.327
That's a good cover story.

12:24.453 --> 12:26.614
Once a cleaner, always a cleaner.

12:27.456 --> 12:29.492
-Chief.
—Yeah.

12:29.625 --> 12:31.115
Thanks.

12:32.127 --> 12:35.290
A map of all the sewer lines
in Haven.

12:35.839 --> 12:38.080
So we bolt down
all the manhole covers,

12:38.216 --> 12:40.207
sweep the lines
one end to the other.

12:40.344 --> 12:42.460
We'll need every cop
and city worker on it.

12:42.596 --> 12:44.507
Yeah, but whatever it is,
we'll find it.

13:08.497 --> 13:10.158
[Screams]

13:14.544 --> 13:16.705
In case he was able
to get the body of here fast

13:16.838 --> 13:18.703
because she was—exsanguinated
like the others.

13:18.840 --> 13:21.456
But it doesn't look
like they spilled a single drop.

13:21.593 --> 13:24.300
They always spill a little.
We just have to find it.

13:24.429 --> 13:28.718
From your truck, chief,
as requested.

13:31.395 --> 13:32.726
You still carry that around?

26:40.016 --> 26:42.849
—An evil sponge.
—I said shut up, Jordan!

26:49.442 --> 26:51.524
Look, we just have to find
the rest of it.

26:51.652 --> 26:53.779
[Electricity buzzing]

27:05.249 --> 27:07.865
I think it just found us.

27:22.517 --> 27:24.599
That's a lot of blood.

27:24.727 --> 27:26.513
What's it doing?

27:32.026 --> 27:34.984
Okay, everyone back away
very slowly.

27:38.032 --> 27:39.568
If we spread out, it'll get weaker.

27:44.413 --> 27:46.540
I don't think it wants any of us,
Sasquatch.

27:46.666 --> 27:48.281
I think it wants Nathan.

27:48.417 --> 27:49.793
You think the blood
is mad at Nathan?

27:49.919 --> 27:52.410
I'm not saying that he's not
a nice guy or anything,

27:52.547 --> 27:53.912
but based on what I've seen
since I've been in town,

27:54.048 --> 27:55.288
everything is mad at Nathan.

27:56.467 --> 27:59.083
Well, it's gonna keep on coming
unless we do something.

27:59.220 --> 28:00.300
[Taser clicking]

28:08.229 --> 28:10.094
Okay, I thought I'd give that a shot.

28:10.231 --> 28:11.721
You hurt it.

28:13.901 --> 28:15.311
Mike...

28:15.444 --> 28:19.938
Look, this is what
your trouble is doing.

28:22.660 --> 28:23.775
Oh, my God.

28:23.911 --> 28:25.447
That blood is mine?

28:25.580 --> 28:27.286
It's already killed four people.

28:27.415 --> 28:28.325
All to get to Nathan?

28:31.586 --> 28:33.793
It wants you? Why?

28:33.921 --> 28:35.786
Because you're angry with me?

28:35.923 --> 28:37.959
And you have every right
to want revenge, but ——

28:38.092 --> 28:39.081
No.

28:39.218 --> 28:42.802
No, look, when my wife died,
my trouble activated.

28:42.930 --> 28:44.795
Yesterday I cut myself.

28:44.932 --> 28:45.842
I thought I was being careful,

28:45.975 --> 28:48.887
but some of the blood
must have went down the drain.

28:49.020 --> 28:50.510
I don't want you dead, Nathan.

28:50.646 --> 28:52.102
—Then stop it!
—I can't.

28:52.982 --> 28:55.564
I don't know how to stop it.
I'm telling you the truth.

28:56.944 --> 28:58.809
It's on a mission to kill me.

28:58.946 --> 29:00.652
Maybe it can't stop until it does.

29:00.781 --> 29:03.238
Unless we can stop this thing,
we're about to find out.

29:07.121 --> 29:08.531
Jordan!

29:21.802 --> 29:24.339
Crocker's trouble protected him.

29:24.472 --> 29:26.679
I figured the blood
might not like my trouble either.

29:26.807 --> 29:29.514
It sure doesn't,
but not enough to stop it.

29:32.355 --> 29:33.936
Here we go again.

29:39.403 --> 29:41.018
You two from Haven P.D.?

29:41.155 --> 29:42.986
We're ready for you.

29:49.997 --> 29:51.828
Give us a moment.

29:57.505 --> 29:59.871
This was never supposed to happen.

30:00.007 --> 30:02.123
I wasn't supposed to be here
in this chair,

30:02.259 --> 30:06.719
in this suit, in this place.

30:06.847 --> 30:09.429
—We don't know that it's her.
—We don't know that it isn't.

30:09.558 --> 30:12.345
Which is why we have to go in there
and do what Dwight asked.

30:17.191 --> 30:18.431
Okay...

30:19.360 --> 30:22.523
You don't have to go.
I'll go.

30:22.655 --> 30:24.191
This is what it must have been like

30:24.323 --> 30:28.362
for Nathan watching Audrey
walk into that barn.

30:29.328 --> 30:31.569
It was an impossible decision.

30:31.706 --> 30:32.912
Oh, what I would give to make it

30:33.040 --> 30:34.746
so that there's no chance
that Audrey Parker

30:34.875 --> 30:37.412
is on the other side of that door.

It can't be morning, okay?
I just ——

30:55.104 --> 30:57.095
—| just left.
—It always feels like that.

30:57.231 --> 30:58.596
—Coffee's on in the back.
—No.

30:58.733 --> 31:01.941
l literallyjust walked out that door
and came in the other one.

31:02.069 --> 31:04.276
None of this makes any sense.

31:04.405 --> 31:06.771
Lex, if you're angling for a sick day,
take it up with the boss.

31:06.907 --> 31:08.693
But you and I both know
you took off early yesterday.

31:08.826 --> 31:10.282
Rhonda, l'm dry.

31:21.088 --> 31:22.419
What is this place?

31:26.594 --> 31:28.425
Am I...

31:31.515 --> 31:33.471
Am I dead?

31:39.940 --> 31:42.317
I can shock it again,
but I can't hold it back forever.

31:42.443 --> 31:43.728
I don't want it to hurt anyone else.

31:43.861 --> 31:45.726
Please, someone do something.

31:45.863 --> 31:47.148
It's your blood.
You do something.

31:47.281 --> 31:48.817
I don't control it.
It's like it's alive.

31:48.949 --> 31:50.814
We have to find a way to contain it.

31:50.951 --> 31:52.942
How? Where?

31:53.079 --> 31:54.865
ln Mike.

31:54.997 --> 31:56.328
I don't want to do that.

31:56.457 --> 32:00.166
No, it might kill him like the others,
make it even stronger.

32:01.962 --> 32:03.122
It didn't kill me.

32:03.714 --> 32:05.250
lt tried to, but I just absorbed it.

32:05.382 --> 32:07.338
Duke, that was a few drops.

32:07.468 --> 32:09.299
You don't know what absorbing
that much troubled blood

32:09.428 --> 32:10.087
will do to you.

32:10.221 --> 32:12.428
Yeah, maybe not,
but I do know exactly

32:12.556 --> 32:15.468
what that much troubled blood
wants to do to you.

32:40.960 --> 32:42.621
Don't touch me.

Duke, stop.

33:07.319 --> 33:08.570
What if he's dying?

33:08.696 --> 33:10.311

It might not be safe yet.

33:18.080 --> 33:20.366
Let's make sure Duke got it all.

33:27.423 --> 33:30.631
Now I know why you bolted
when I cut my finger.

33:32.761 --> 33:35.013
You didn't trust me enough
to tell me?

33:37.850 --> 33:40.216
My thing with troubled blood...

33:42.062 --> 33:44.189
lt's ugly.

33:45.774 --> 33:48.982
You looked like you were
in so much pain.

33:50.070 --> 33:51.981
That's just it.

33:53.490 --> 33:54.741
It doesn't hurt.

33:57.661 --> 33:59.743
It feels amazing...

34:00.873 --> 34:02.579
Like heroin amazing.

34:04.460 --> 34:06.325
Or at least
that's what people tell me.

34:09.381 --> 34:12.123
I saw what this thing did
to my father...

34:13.093 --> 34:14.879
...and my grandfather.

34:15.763 --> 34:18.596
Whatever family I had,
it's ripping it apart.

No...

Not yet.

34:26.148 --> 34:27.228
That's why I have to get him
out of Haven

34:27.358 --> 34:29.974
before this thing gets him killed.

in front of a stranger

34:55.636 --> 34:59.049
and fought that thing off for you?

34:59.848 --> 35:03.682

whether it was gonna kill me,

I was almost sorry.

I didn't mean to be so hard
on you earlier, Lex.

37:34.336 --> 37:36.167
It's been a long shift.

where all the hard bodies
take their clothes off.

the rest aren't real.

to let Rhonda go.

homemade mac and cheese.

Now what?

You're next.

Heard you lost one of your own today.

39:09.640 --> 39:11.847
Thank you for letting me
speak with him.

39:11.975 --> 39:14.591
Mike is one of mine.
I feel responsible.

39:14.728 --> 39:16.434
Did he know
what his blood could do?

39:16.563 --> 39:18.428
Just family stories
that if his blood spilled,

39:18.565 --> 39:20.726
it would go after
the one he hates the most.

39:21.401 --> 39:23.266
That was me.

39:23.403 --> 39:24.529
That really surprised him.

39:24.655 --> 39:27.271
He had no idea
he hated you that much.

39:27.407 --> 39:30.774
Maybe he just needed
somewhere to focus his pain.

39:30.911 --> 39:33.527
Mike lost someone he loves.

39:33.664 --> 39:36.531
But enough people have suffered.

39:41.338 --> 39:44.000
It's time to let go of old grudges.

He's made mistakes,
but he's our only chance.

39:58.188 --> 40:01.146

40:01.275 --> 40:03.687
Oh, no, you won't.

for crushing your windpipe earlier?

Well, lam.

40:19.543 --> 40:22.501
You know, I'm not a big fan
of this whole Crocker thing.

40:23.880 --> 40:25.836
But sometimes it comes in handy.

40:25.966 --> 40:30.050
Why don't we drink to a day
without the troubles?

40:31.138 --> 40:31.797
Just one.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.670
I don't think
that's too much to ask for.

40:33.807 --> 40:35.172
You don't like being a hero?

40:35.309 --> 40:39.803
If my brother is a hero,
I would like to buy him a drink.

What did Duke do?

40:43.650 --> 40:45.356

This looks like fun.

40:48.488 --> 40:50.979
l'll catch you later, Crockers.

40:52.576 --> 40:54.817
What's he talking about?

40:57.331 --> 40:58.696
Leave it alone, Wade.

40:58.832 --> 41:00.868
What, I can't celebrate
my brother's accomplishments?

41:01.001 --> 41:02.491
—Come on.
—Duke.

41:02.628 --> 41:04.289
You need to call Nathan.

41:11.762 --> 41:16.472
Nathan, I head Audrey's voice again
in my head.

41:16.600 --> 41:18.716
But it was different.

41:18.852 --> 41:20.558
This time totally different.

41:20.687 --> 41:22.393
What did you hear?

41:22.522 --> 41:26.856
She was talking about being trapped
inside a place that wasn't real.

41:26.985 --> 41:29.146
Nathan, we've been assuming
that the barn spit Audrey out

41:29.279 --> 41:31.440
at the same time it did me.

41:33.033 --> 41:34.989
What if we were wrong?

41:36.370 --> 41:38.702
What if she's still inside?

41:40.540 --> 41:44.909
The barn imploded.
I saw it.

41:45.045 --> 41:47.878
Time moves differently inside there.

41:48.006 --> 41:50.622
What was six months out here
only felt like a few seconds to me.

41:50.759 --> 41:54.547
So you think Audrey
is still in the barn,

41:54.680 --> 41:57.638
and it's still imploding?

41:57.766 --> 42:00.007
This place has many names.

42:00.143 --> 42:04.307
You know it most recently
as the barn.

42:04.439 --> 42:05.599
I prefer bar.

42:05.732 --> 42:08.109
Well, call it what you will.

42:08.235 --> 42:10.601
lt's dying.

42:10.737 --> 42:12.693
And unless we move fast,

42:12.823 --> 42:15.155
it's gonna take you with it.
