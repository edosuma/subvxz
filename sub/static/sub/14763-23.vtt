WEBVTT

00:00.917 --> 00:02.111
Iron man: Las Vegas.

00:02.158 --> 00:04.239
Everyone on your best behavior.

00:04.286 --> 00:05.404
Nice view, iron man,

00:05.451 --> 00:07.563
but I'm guessing
that's not why we're here.

00:07.610 --> 00:08.924
This is where
the security alert said

00:08.971 --> 00:10.595
Maximus would be, Hawkeye.

00:11.762 --> 00:13.035
Black widow: Maximus?

00:13.082 --> 00:15.151
Hulk: Black bolt's
brother, tech genius.

00:15.198 --> 00:16.627
Got a thing against humans.

00:16.674 --> 00:18.929
Heard the inhumans exiled him.

00:18.976 --> 00:20.156
What's he planning?

00:20.203 --> 00:21.172
Don't know, cap.

00:21.219 --> 00:23.148
Black bolt didn't
include any details.

00:23.203 --> 00:24.773
I assume the alert
came from him.

00:24.828 --> 00:28.134
It's one dude.
How hard is this gonna be?

00:36.210 --> 00:38.577
I should know by now not to ask.

00:41.182 --> 00:44.516
(People screaming)

00:47.722 --> 00:50.252
Iron man: Where did Maximus
find such pathetic goons?

00:50.518 --> 00:51.839
Falcon:
Off to the side, please.

00:51.899 --> 00:54.366
Thor: You'll be more
comfortable over there.

00:55.329 --> 00:57.829
Goons are covered.
Take the fight to Maximus.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:08.556 --> 01:11.423
Maximus: The Avengers are here.
How exciting.

01:12.246 --> 01:13.342
Move in!

01:13.389 --> 01:15.414
(Snickering)

01:21.288 --> 01:22.821
(Groaning)
(Groaning)

01:23.967 --> 01:26.827
You Avengers may have made
it past my shock troopers,

01:26.875 --> 01:28.795
but you're too late.

01:29.108 --> 01:32.241
My Terrigen Bomb will
detonate at any moment.

01:32.467 --> 01:35.131
Uh, Maximus, you know the
Terrigen mist has already been

01:35.178 --> 01:37.968
dispersed all
over the world, right?

01:38.140 --> 01:41.054
Created lots of new inhumans?

01:41.265 --> 01:44.804
In certain forms, Terrigen
can become very unstable,

01:44.960 --> 01:48.187
like the isotopic form
I'm using right now.

01:48.324 --> 01:50.992
It has the power to level the city.

01:51.187 --> 01:55.454
I don't think that's Black Bolt approved.
Gonna have to shut it down.

01:58.492 --> 02:00.867
My brother is a fool.

02:01.023 --> 02:04.851
You humans are nothing next to
the great inhuman civilization.

02:04.945 --> 02:08.088
The idea that we can
"work together" disgusts me.

02:08.134 --> 02:10.639
My scans show the bomb
is located in this building.

02:10.687 --> 02:13.405
We've got to get past
Maximus and disarm it.

02:16.971 --> 02:18.885
Maximus: Destroying one of the
great human cities will show

02:18.932 --> 02:22.971
that humans and inhumans
can never live in Harmony.

02:23.184 --> 02:26.382
Thor: This beast needs to be
taught a lesson. (Snickering)

02:26.616 --> 02:27.974
(Roaring)

02:29.918 --> 02:31.318
(Grunts)

02:35.591 --> 02:38.300
Stay on it. It's regenerating.

02:39.179 --> 02:41.010
Here's your ride home!

02:46.331 --> 02:48.698
Iron man:
You're surrounded, Maximus.

02:48.809 --> 02:50.878
Then it's time to do this.

02:50.988 --> 02:53.986
And now, the famous
lights of Las Vegas...

02:54.057 --> 02:55.481
Extinguished.

02:59.317 --> 03:01.717
Maximus is getting away.
I've got him.

03:03.921 --> 03:06.254
(Groaning)

03:08.065 --> 03:09.877
No. I... I don't.

03:10.010 --> 03:12.320
Iron man: It's fine.
We've got bigger problems.

03:12.405 --> 03:14.249
Fifty seconds to detonation.

03:14.422 --> 03:18.718
Not a lot of time. Widow,
Hawkeye, keep him busy.

03:18.914 --> 03:21.476
Hawkeye: Armed goons,
crazy robot, giant bomb...

03:21.562 --> 03:24.273
Still not the worst
weekend I've had in Vegas.

03:27.181 --> 03:28.277
(Engines whining)

03:28.479 --> 03:30.015
But it's close.

03:50.817 --> 03:54.118
Lousy robot keeps fixing itself!

04:04.530 --> 04:05.998
Enough of this foolishness!

04:06.092 --> 04:09.337
I know one place where
he will not bother us anymore.

04:10.231 --> 04:12.431
(Roaring)

04:19.678 --> 04:22.046
He is no longer earth's problem!

04:23.854 --> 04:26.858
Iron man: The circuitry is complex.
No time to disarm it.

04:27.037 --> 04:29.147
Well, how about getting
it out of here?

04:29.287 --> 04:30.811
It's hard-wired into the building.

04:30.905 --> 04:32.233
Running off the power supply.

04:32.327 --> 04:33.686
Pull it out and it could blow.

04:33.764 --> 04:35.952
But we can cut off the juice.

04:36.139 --> 04:39.334
No more power,
nothing to set off the bomb.

04:43.248 --> 04:46.122
Hulk, rip those
power cables out now.

04:46.170 --> 04:47.931
(Roaring)

04:47.978 --> 04:51.608
I don't rip. I smash! (Grunts)

04:53.803 --> 04:55.771
Iron man:
Vegas can add this to my tab.

04:58.055 --> 05:00.488
(Radar beeping)
Hmm?

05:01.342 --> 05:02.855
How's it going?

05:03.034 --> 05:04.458
Huh?

05:06.142 --> 05:08.209
(Maximus screaming)

05:09.867 --> 05:11.299
(Screaming)

05:11.936 --> 05:13.608
(Screams)

05:13.831 --> 05:16.030
You left without saying goodbye.

05:16.413 --> 05:19.207
Thor: Yes. Very rude.

05:19.897 --> 05:22.808
You stopped the bomb,
but inhumans and humans

05:22.889 --> 05:26.038
living together will
not end well for anyone.

05:26.131 --> 05:29.147
It will lead to the downfall
of our great race.

05:29.217 --> 05:32.131
(Chuckles) I'm always
up for more punching.

05:32.210 --> 05:34.288
Why don't we let
Black Bolt deal with it?

05:34.366 --> 05:37.241
<i>He isn't the one who
sent the alert. I am.</i>

05:37.405 --> 05:39.850
(Scoffs) Truman Marsh.

05:39.913 --> 05:42.796
Seems like you think everything's
your business. Jerk.

05:42.844 --> 05:45.756
<i>Only what threatens
the safety of civilians.</i>

05:45.880 --> 05:47.924
<i>Ghost nearly destroyed
Avengers Tower,</i>

05:47.972 --> 05:50.102
<i>and now Maximus
threatened a whole city.</i>

05:50.149 --> 05:52.710
<i>You Avengers have a duty
to make sure inhumans,</i>

05:52.764 --> 05:55.514
<i>old and new,
don't get out of hand.</i>

05:55.663 --> 05:57.928
Um, is that in anyone
else's contract?

05:57.991 --> 05:59.712
'Cause I don't remember that part.

05:59.759 --> 06:02.702
<i>At times like this, we all
have to do a little extra.</i>

06:02.862 --> 06:04.717
<i>Good job capturing
this criminal.</i>

06:04.803 --> 06:06.569
Don't need your
performance review.

06:06.663 --> 06:09.631
Time to get Mr. Anger
control issues to Attilan.

06:09.772 --> 06:10.779
<i>I'm coming, too.</i>

06:10.826 --> 06:13.162
After you exiled Hulk and nearly
got us killed?

06:13.210 --> 06:14.310
No, you're not.

06:14.358 --> 06:15.819
<i>Don't you dare hang up...</i>

06:15.867 --> 06:17.458
(Rocket blasting)

06:23.040 --> 06:25.803
(Girl giggling) Man 1: All right,
let's see what you got.

06:25.900 --> 06:27.522
Man 2: Did you see that?

06:28.090 --> 06:30.557
Man 3: Over here! Do it again!

06:31.125 --> 06:33.124
Look over there.

06:36.796 --> 06:41.077
Avengers, welcome
to the new Attilan.

06:41.413 --> 06:44.428
Wow, this place has
really changed, Gorgon.

06:44.514 --> 06:48.655
Since the Terrigen wave, new inhumans
have been arriving in Attilan

06:48.729 --> 06:52.491
to learn about their legacy,
and to practice their powers.

06:52.566 --> 06:55.717
Thank you for taking
care of this problem.

06:55.783 --> 06:58.600
Sorry for the chaos he caused.

06:58.696 --> 07:00.996
You don't know what you've done.

07:01.926 --> 07:03.614
(Growling)

07:03.747 --> 07:04.868
(Weak laughter)

07:04.915 --> 07:07.327
Gorgon: Take him to
the processing center.

07:07.469 --> 07:11.050
And then transfer him to
the maximum security facility.

07:11.194 --> 07:14.327
He will be dealt
with appropriately.

07:14.421 --> 07:17.459
I know you are busy,
but please, stay for a bit.

07:18.447 --> 07:19.946
(Laughing)

07:23.678 --> 07:25.030
Hawkeye: Look at all these
people who picked up

07:25.077 --> 07:27.186
and left their homes
and their lives.

07:27.342 --> 07:28.396
It's kind of amazing.

07:28.444 --> 07:30.069
A place where
you can be yourself

07:30.116 --> 07:32.389
and work on making
the most of your skills.

07:32.444 --> 07:35.397
A new home. I see the appeal.

07:35.477 --> 07:39.576
For the first time in a long
time, there is optimism here.

07:39.764 --> 07:43.194
We can see a new future
for our race.

07:43.374 --> 07:47.288
Even with all the new inhumans,
there's a sense of peace.

07:49.927 --> 07:51.546
Heads up.
(Laughs nervously)

07:51.600 --> 07:52.672
Iron man:
We appreciate the tour,

07:52.719 --> 07:54.169
but we need to talk to Black Bolt.

07:54.202 --> 07:57.232
Of course. Come with me.

07:57.819 --> 07:59.842
Think I'll keep looking around.

08:00.324 --> 08:02.248
I'll come, too.

08:03.628 --> 08:04.816
Iron man: Marsh.

08:04.905 --> 08:07.973
Marsh: Avengers. Nice of
you to make an appearance.

08:08.202 --> 08:09.866
What took you so long?

08:09.960 --> 08:11.256
Iron man: Doing some actual work,

08:11.303 --> 08:14.113
instead of just showing up
when the hard part's done.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.756
Did I say that out loud?

08:15.842 --> 08:17.889
You know you say everything out loud.

08:18.092 --> 08:20.764
Avengers, it is
always good to see you.

08:20.891 --> 08:23.366
Black Bolt and Medusa
and I were discussing

08:23.414 --> 08:26.639
how to help all these new inhumans
integrate into the world.

08:26.811 --> 08:28.866
They're adjusting well so far.

08:28.983 --> 08:31.475
Why fix something
that isn't broken?

08:31.576 --> 08:34.664
You don't think what happened
in Las Vegas was a problem?

08:34.772 --> 08:39.232
That's why the national security council
has proposed the inhuman registration act.

08:39.482 --> 08:41.506
I don't like the sound of that.

08:41.592 --> 08:43.756
Every inhuman
will be registered.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.694
They will have
their powers tracked.

08:45.742 --> 08:48.805
Those that don't comply
willingly will go to prison.

08:48.936 --> 08:51.049
Iron man: I can't believe
you're even listening to this.

08:51.096 --> 08:54.913
Your Majesty, you think he knows
better for your people than you do?

08:55.058 --> 08:59.241
Black bolt has come to accept that
everything has changed for the inhumans.

08:59.389 --> 09:01.608
There are so many of us.

09:01.741 --> 09:05.421
We can no longer isolate ourselves
from the outside world.

09:05.515 --> 09:08.796
But... we do not
like this proposal.

09:09.077 --> 09:12.569
There must be a way to compromise
for the good of our people.

09:15.012 --> 09:17.217
They seem happy, but I wonder

09:17.296 --> 09:19.897
what kind of challenges they'll
face back in the human world?

09:20.059 --> 09:23.115
They got a community now.
Makes things easier.

09:23.342 --> 09:25.358
Yeah, I can see that.

09:25.542 --> 09:27.616
Banner had
a community of scientists.

09:27.858 --> 09:29.710
Wish there had been
a community of Hulks.

09:29.758 --> 09:33.506
And I used a little of this
to save Avengers Tower.

09:34.814 --> 09:37.483
I was a newbie like
yourselves once, too.

09:37.872 --> 09:39.471
You'll get the hang of it.

09:41.803 --> 09:44.036
(Groaning, losing control)

09:45.329 --> 09:47.137
Hulk: We got this.

09:50.465 --> 09:52.144
(Stammers) Wait,
where are you going?

09:52.191 --> 09:53.804
Falcon:
How's it going, Inferno?

09:53.926 --> 09:55.965
I thought I was getting
better at controlling it.

09:56.128 --> 09:58.605
Stop and think before you act.

09:58.728 --> 10:00.750
Instincts will catch up.

10:00.891 --> 10:02.394
It's good to see you guys.

10:02.457 --> 10:04.293
The royal family's
been great and all,

10:04.371 --> 10:06.121
but they're so focused
on the new inhumans,

10:06.199 --> 10:08.207
they've left me to explore
Attilan on my own.

10:08.285 --> 10:10.426
Did you know they have
secret laboratories?

10:10.483 --> 10:12.566
Oh. And they have catacombs.

10:12.801 --> 10:15.926
You, new inhuman with
the power of fire.

10:16.059 --> 10:19.426
What do they call you
back home? Freak? Misfit?

10:19.605 --> 10:21.840
Wherever you come from,
they don't trust you.

10:21.912 --> 10:23.394
They'll hunt you down.

10:23.523 --> 10:24.871
- Ignore him.
- No!

10:25.098 --> 10:28.143
It's not true! My family
and friends, they...

10:28.191 --> 10:29.629
They know you're not like them.

10:29.707 --> 10:31.598
You'll never be normal again.

10:31.691 --> 10:33.321
Normal's overrated.

10:33.577 --> 10:35.043
(Grunting)

10:37.387 --> 10:39.427
(Voice echoing)
You're a monster.

10:40.864 --> 10:42.953
No... I'm not!

10:43.000 --> 10:46.267
(Maximus laughing)
(Inferno screaming)

10:47.236 --> 10:48.934
Hulk:
Remember what I told you!

10:48.988 --> 10:52.613
(Grunts) This is the
opposite of control.

10:53.059 --> 10:55.418
The registration disk
itself is small.

10:55.749 --> 10:57.668
Everyone will forget
they're wearing it.

10:57.774 --> 10:59.519
Sounds convenient for you.

10:59.601 --> 11:02.732
It's the same technology I developed
to track the movement of the Hulk.

11:02.842 --> 11:05.004
But even more powerful.

11:05.098 --> 11:08.551
This would make it possible
to locate any inhuman

11:08.658 --> 11:10.121
who is out of control.

11:10.301 --> 11:12.652
Or whose powers you just don't like.

11:13.096 --> 11:15.496
(Screaming)

11:17.910 --> 11:21.285
(Inferno whimpering)

11:21.362 --> 11:25.699
(Grunts) We shall not be
turned into pancakes today.

11:25.840 --> 11:28.082
But we might still be barbecued!

11:28.745 --> 11:31.245
(Screaming)

11:33.418 --> 11:35.801
Dante! What happened?
What are you doing?

11:35.928 --> 11:38.951
(Groaning) Can't stop it!

11:38.998 --> 11:40.480
(Screaming)

11:40.551 --> 11:43.535
Falcon: Sorry to bring bad
news, but Maximus escaped.

11:43.669 --> 11:45.598
And there's also this Inferno thing.

11:45.704 --> 11:47.295
(Groaning)

11:48.855 --> 11:51.957
Inferno! I know
you can handle it.

11:52.082 --> 11:53.566
I saw you!

11:53.804 --> 11:56.626
He was right. I am a monster!

11:56.801 --> 11:58.980
You're wrong!
We've seen you be a hero!

11:59.066 --> 12:02.243
(Groans) Please help!

12:04.715 --> 12:05.844
(Cries in pain)

12:05.926 --> 12:07.332
Hulk: Dante!

12:07.398 --> 12:09.207
Split up.
Find Maximus and Inferno

12:09.255 --> 12:10.668
before they do any more damage.

12:10.763 --> 12:12.949
Think I might know
where Inferno is going.

12:13.059 --> 12:17.230
I'll go on my own. Don't
want him to get freaked out.

12:17.621 --> 12:19.505
You know, that's the first time
we send the Hulk somewhere

12:19.552 --> 12:20.910
to not freak someone out.

12:21.019 --> 12:23.559
Iron man: The rest of us need
to track down Maximus.

12:23.700 --> 12:25.574
Marsh: I'm already
way ahead of you.

12:25.644 --> 12:29.735
I had a registration disk attached
to him at the processing center.

12:29.863 --> 12:31.803
He's headed toward the bridge.

12:31.902 --> 12:33.887
Still think it's a bad idea?

12:34.027 --> 12:37.480
Iron man: Listen to us for once
and get yourself out of Attilan.

12:37.605 --> 12:39.213
For your own safety.

12:40.717 --> 12:42.176
Gorgon: Halt!

12:42.246 --> 12:45.246
We have unfinished
business, Maximus.

12:45.387 --> 12:48.090
The Avengers were right
to thwart me in Las Vegas.

12:48.199 --> 12:49.269
Destroying the city

12:49.317 --> 12:51.414
would have been merely
a symbolic gesture.

12:51.462 --> 12:53.480
But my plan has evolved.

12:53.637 --> 12:56.426
And you brought me
right to the perfect target.

12:56.474 --> 12:58.504
I'm about to destroy Attilan.

12:58.582 --> 13:00.835
Why would I let you leave?

13:04.582 --> 13:06.262
You couldn't even
blow up one building.

13:06.340 --> 13:08.332
What makes you think
you can destroy a whole city?

13:08.441 --> 13:09.543
By bringing me here,

13:09.591 --> 13:12.230
you've also brought the
explosive Terrigen isotope.

13:12.293 --> 13:13.980
It only takes a small amount.

13:14.098 --> 13:17.191
Now all of Attilan
is one giant bomb.

13:17.239 --> 13:19.785
If you want to keep humans
and inhumans separate,

13:19.871 --> 13:21.363
why destroy Attilan?

13:21.518 --> 13:23.988
It's too late to
isolate ourselves again.

13:24.129 --> 13:26.750
The outsiders are already here.

13:26.832 --> 13:30.340
Better to destroy it all than to
let our society be corrupted.

13:30.418 --> 13:34.035
You know what's not too late?
Stopping your insane plan!

13:37.474 --> 13:38.754
(Chuckling)

13:38.832 --> 13:40.941
Even if he's spread
the isotope around the city,

13:41.066 --> 13:43.434
he can't make all
of Attilan go up at once!

13:43.504 --> 13:46.912
What would it take?
Basically... a lot of fuses.

13:47.098 --> 13:49.739
You're wrong. I just need one...

13:49.824 --> 13:52.512
One that moves...
That's out of control.

13:52.579 --> 13:54.301
Sound like anyone you know?

13:54.832 --> 13:55.971
Iron man: Dante.

13:56.019 --> 13:58.926
Get through the force field or
everyone on Attilan will be trapped.

13:59.097 --> 14:01.888
Let's hope Hulk's having
better luck with Inferno.

14:02.799 --> 14:04.866
Inferno?

14:06.323 --> 14:07.855
It's me!

14:09.098 --> 14:10.905
Just want to talk!

14:12.527 --> 14:13.959
(Grunts)

14:15.410 --> 14:18.551
I destroyed the palace.
It's all my fault.

14:18.684 --> 14:22.281
That was all Maximus.
No one blames you.

14:22.399 --> 14:25.492
(Sighs) My powers just feel
so much stronger here.

14:25.680 --> 14:28.766
And what Maximus said...
It's like I lost my mind!

14:28.976 --> 14:31.961
I thought I'd be safer here. Or maybe
everyone else would be safer from me.

14:32.022 --> 14:34.539
But they're not. No one is!

14:34.781 --> 14:36.594
(Flashes pop)

14:36.774 --> 14:38.469
Uh, hey, did you see that?

14:38.547 --> 14:41.250
My EMP arrows short it out
for a second.

14:41.313 --> 14:43.492
Must be interfering with
the field's frequency.

14:43.562 --> 14:45.141
I can work with that.

14:45.267 --> 14:47.767
Hawkeye: Focus your attacks
on the same spot.

14:52.495 --> 14:54.650
First things first:
Evacuate the city.

14:54.698 --> 14:56.977
Iron man: We could still
save it if we find Inferno.

14:57.086 --> 14:59.656
And where we find Inferno,
we find Hulk.

14:59.719 --> 15:01.992
Okay? All things first.
(Distant boom)

15:02.141 --> 15:03.617
(Inferno screaming)
Hulk: Help Dante!

15:03.689 --> 15:06.214
Come on! Help us!

15:08.698 --> 15:10.932
(Yelling, screaming)

15:15.672 --> 15:19.040
It's too late! We must
begin the evacuation.

15:20.641 --> 15:22.274
Medusa: (Over PA)
<i>Fellow inhumans.</i>

15:22.336 --> 15:24.425
Evacuate the city at once.

15:24.602 --> 15:28.282
(Yelling) <i>Make for the
bridge into the human towns.</i>

15:28.437 --> 15:29.617
Run!

15:29.664 --> 15:31.964
<i>You must remain calm.</i>

15:33.456 --> 15:35.256
<i>You will not be abandoned.</i>

15:35.984 --> 15:37.858
<i>Go to safety.</i>

15:40.850 --> 15:42.916
<i>Protect one another.</i>

15:46.418 --> 15:49.052
I'm sorry, Your Majesty,
but it's time to go.

15:49.702 --> 15:52.229
We cannot abandon our home.

15:52.315 --> 15:56.331
The new inhumans need your
leadership now more than ever.

16:05.369 --> 16:08.089
We can't leave Hulk
and Inferno behind. Go.

16:08.201 --> 16:09.559
I'll catch up.

16:11.924 --> 16:13.987
Iron man: Get the royal family
to the human towns.

16:14.088 --> 16:15.939
I'll stay with widow.
We'll keep looking

16:15.987 --> 16:18.145
until the last possible moment.

16:19.336 --> 16:21.069
No matter what it takes.

16:34.451 --> 16:37.667
Attilan...
It's all gone.

16:37.753 --> 16:40.409
And we've lost one of our own.

16:40.792 --> 16:44.190
Iron man, Widow, Hulk...
They're still alive in there.

16:44.278 --> 16:46.206
And they'll find Inferno.

16:46.429 --> 16:47.650
Black Widow: Hulk!

16:47.839 --> 16:49.694
Iron man:
I'm not reading any signs.

16:49.901 --> 16:51.630
This may have been a bad idea.

16:51.831 --> 16:53.431
(Cracking sound)

16:53.478 --> 16:54.657
Whoa!

16:54.704 --> 16:57.772
(Hissing)
Oh! Oh...

16:58.309 --> 16:59.598
Oh!

16:59.676 --> 17:02.332
Go! Get out of here.
It's too late!

17:02.387 --> 17:03.944
It's never too late!

17:05.238 --> 17:07.637
Get ready.
Black widow: What?

17:11.684 --> 17:14.577
What? <i>Heat-resistant and
nearly indestructible.</i>

17:14.785 --> 17:16.479
Only had the prototype
standing by,

17:16.582 --> 17:18.003
but I thought
it'd come in handy.

17:18.051 --> 17:19.699
Now we're ready to rescue.

17:20.637 --> 17:22.797
Hulk! Inferno!

17:23.586 --> 17:26.020
Black widow:
Hulk! Where are you?

17:29.606 --> 17:31.072
(Black widow grunts)

17:33.231 --> 17:35.707
- No one could survive here.
- Not here.

17:35.849 --> 17:37.083
It's no use.

17:37.145 --> 17:38.802
No, I'm not giving up.

17:38.850 --> 17:40.278
<i>There's nothing left here.</i>

17:40.388 --> 17:42.447
<i>Nowhere for anyone to hide.</i>

17:42.494 --> 17:44.997
(Whirring, beeping)

17:45.170 --> 17:47.804
<i>Hulk wouldn't want you
to sacrifice yourself.</i>

17:48.495 --> 17:49.927
You're right.

17:54.497 --> 17:57.064
(Grunts)

17:58.535 --> 17:59.935
Hold on.

18:00.270 --> 18:01.803
(Grunts)

18:04.234 --> 18:05.942
You can't save me!

18:06.036 --> 18:08.346
Hulk: An exploding city
never stopped the Hulk.

18:08.487 --> 18:09.977
(Glass shattering)

18:20.559 --> 18:22.025
(Grunts)

18:22.359 --> 18:23.708
Friend Hulk!

18:23.802 --> 18:26.153
We thought...
It's good to see you.

18:26.262 --> 18:28.403
Hulk: Job's not done yet.

18:29.869 --> 18:31.380
(Grunts)

18:38.388 --> 18:40.036
I got this.

18:40.130 --> 18:41.997
(Groaning)
Look who I found

18:42.045 --> 18:44.012
trying to blend in with the civilians.

18:44.083 --> 18:45.317
(Grunts)

18:45.849 --> 18:49.239
The destruction of Attilan
was a beautiful sight.

18:49.895 --> 18:52.442
You call yourself a king.

18:52.677 --> 18:55.130
But you have betrayed
our legacy.

18:55.334 --> 18:59.161
(Grunts) The inhuman
race used to be proud.

18:59.325 --> 19:03.169
You will forever regret the day
you allied with the humans.

19:05.502 --> 19:06.801
No!
(Grunting)

19:06.849 --> 19:09.059
(Whispering echo) Brother.

19:09.165 --> 19:10.722
(Groans)

19:13.231 --> 19:15.255
In trying to keep us apart,

19:15.427 --> 19:20.974
Maximus' actions have taken a toll
on both humans and inhumans today.

19:21.133 --> 19:24.356
In a way, he's brought us
closer together.

19:24.599 --> 19:26.278
The Avengers are at your service.

19:26.326 --> 19:27.685
We'll come up with a plan.

19:27.849 --> 19:30.247
We'll do something.

19:30.341 --> 19:32.075
We need to find
a temporary shelter

19:32.123 --> 19:33.525
until Attilan can be rebuilt.

19:33.666 --> 19:35.957
(Whirring, whooshes)

19:43.794 --> 19:46.505
I told you that
the inhumans are dangerous.

19:46.599 --> 19:48.684
What happened today
proves my point.

19:48.880 --> 19:52.161
Now everyone can see that
safety precautions are needed.

19:53.550 --> 19:57.114
I... I'm here to
turn myself in.

19:57.387 --> 19:58.849
(Growls)

19:59.411 --> 20:02.317
Even though not everyone
thinks it's a good idea.

20:02.802 --> 20:05.989
Thank you for your help.
But I have to do this.

20:07.911 --> 20:09.567
Arrest him.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.633
(Groaning)

20:14.504 --> 20:18.200
The world has changed in ways
we were not prepared for.

20:18.517 --> 20:22.067
This was not your fault.
It was Maximus'.

20:22.343 --> 20:24.498
But there are many inhumans now,

20:24.747 --> 20:27.020
and we do not know what
they are capable of.

20:27.168 --> 20:30.341
Today inhuman history
changed forever.

20:30.684 --> 20:33.651
We must do what
is best for our people

20:33.841 --> 20:35.890
and for the whole world.

20:36.903 --> 20:40.450
We will cooperate
with your registration plan.

20:40.572 --> 20:42.911
Thank you, Your Majesty.

20:43.122 --> 20:46.731
I expect the Avengers' help
enforcing registration.

20:46.966 --> 20:49.122
We'll see about that.

20:49.287 --> 20:51.763
And for those who won't
listen to their king...

20:51.934 --> 20:55.333
These are the designs for a
new maximum security prison.

20:55.512 --> 20:57.793
Refusing to be registered
will be considered

20:57.841 --> 21:00.419
a threat to the security
of the world.

21:00.856 --> 21:02.638
Iron man: This is my tech.

21:02.919 --> 21:06.687
And are those guard bots
based on my Hulkbuster armor?

21:07.324 --> 21:10.527
As one royal to another,
Your Majesty,

21:10.599 --> 21:11.965
you cannot just hand over

21:12.013 --> 21:13.525
the sovereignty of your people.

21:13.638 --> 21:18.091
My husband would like to remind
you that this is a new world.

21:20.872 --> 21:23.036
We must use new tactics.

21:23.216 --> 21:27.130
And anyone who does
not adapt is doomed.
