WEBVTT

00:01.168 --> 00:02.408
- Previously on Haven...

00:02.586 --> 00:04.417
- There's a Troubled person

00:04.588 --> 00:05.919
murdering rich people
and resurrecting them

00:06.089 --> 00:07.829
at sundown for ransom money.

00:08.008 --> 00:09.088
- Wait. You're serious?

00:09.259 --> 00:10.760
- Tommy and I got it under control.

00:10.928 --> 00:13.260
I hope you and Duke
find some answers.

00:13.722 --> 00:15.678
(screams)

00:15.849 --> 00:17.805
- I can't have your little boyfriend
screwing this up, okay?

00:17.935 --> 00:19.926
- Whatever you say.
Just let me touch him.

00:20.103 --> 00:22.230
- We would be further ahead
if you could absorb

00:22.356 --> 00:23.766
more than one death a day.

00:23.899 --> 00:26.436
- Dad said that more than
one death a day is dangerous.

00:26.568 --> 00:29.651
- So Moira was the one with the brains.
Noelle's the one with the Trouble.

00:29.780 --> 00:31.145
- Moira, we have to stop.

00:31.281 --> 00:34.148
- We're not stopping
until I get what's coming to me.

00:34.326 --> 00:36.567
- Her name is Noelle.
She's on the run with her sister Moira.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.204
- The one who brings people
back from the dead?

00:38.372 --> 00:40.954
- We found Grady.
Out at Kitchener Mill on Route 17.

00:41.083 --> 00:42.664
He's dead.
- Nathan, one of your guys

00:42.834 --> 00:44.449
was the last to see Grady alive.

00:44.586 --> 00:47.123
- Hasn't been any police activity
logged down on Route 17.

00:47.297 --> 00:49.788
- Then maybe someone's
gone rogue in your department.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.127
- Bolt gun.

00:54.596 --> 00:55.881
- Modified it myself.

00:56.765 --> 00:57.845
- You're the bolt-gun killer.

00:57.975 --> 00:59.681
(shudders)

01:01.270 --> 01:02.350
(gunshot)

01:07.192 --> 01:08.477
(gaSDS)

01:21.039 --> 01:23.075
- And by the time
I got outside, he just...

01:32.759 --> 01:36.001
- Where's the girl that brings people
back from the dead? Where's Noelle?

01:36.179 --> 01:39.671
- She's the one who shot him.
- Where is she, Tommy?!

01:39.850 --> 01:41.010
- She...

01:44.104 --> 01:46.265
- You... you were shooting at her.

01:46.565 --> 01:48.681
Why would you do that?

01:48.859 --> 01:51.316
Get an APB out on her!

01:51.486 --> 01:53.351
- There already is one.

01:58.869 --> 02:00.279
(Duke): Over here!

02:03.957 --> 02:05.822
- You did hit her.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.291
Tommy, she's the only one
that can bring Nathan back.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.999
- All right, she's still moving.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.247
That means she's still alive. Let's go.

02:13.425 --> 02:15.711
She'll head for the main road.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.514
- Where would she go?
Who would she turn to?

02:23.644 --> 02:25.555
She's hurt.
- She's a paramedic in town.

02:25.729 --> 02:27.435
- They have partners.
Who's her partner?

02:27.606 --> 02:30.643
- Oh, pfft...
- Come on, Tommy!

02:30.776 --> 02:32.061
You investigated her.
- I know, okay.

02:32.194 --> 02:34.810
Look, it's a guy,
and his name's Joseph Brentner.

02:34.946 --> 02:36.607
He's her boyfriend too.
They live together.

02:36.740 --> 02:39.322
- Okay, this is what we're gonna do.
We're gonna get Nathan to Noelle,

02:39.493 --> 02:41.779
and she's gonna do her thing.
I wanna get a cruiser to their apartment.

02:41.953 --> 02:43.739
- Wait, Audrey, maybe
we should handle this ourselves.

02:43.914 --> 02:45.950
All right? 'Cause if word
gets out that Nathan died,

02:46.083 --> 02:48.574
it could be hard to explain
if we bring him back.

02:48.752 --> 02:50.538
- When we bring him back.

02:50.712 --> 02:51.747
- Audrey...

02:53.006 --> 02:54.917
The sun sets at 7:47.

02:55.092 --> 02:57.208
- We got two and a half hours to find Noelle.

03:02.474 --> 03:04.931
- Audreyjust came back
from Colorado.

03:05.060 --> 03:08.052
If she went to Colorado,
she found out the truth about James Cogan.

03:08.188 --> 03:11.351
- Well, good. She has every right.
He was her son.

03:11.817 --> 03:15.184
- Vince, you're not thinking this through.

03:15.320 --> 03:18.483
If I found out Audrey went to Colorado,
anybody can.

03:19.825 --> 03:21.281
- Oh.

03:22.953 --> 03:26.195
If the bolt-gun killer thinks
she has some new information

03:26.331 --> 03:30.870
about the Colorado Kid--
- He'll go after her again.

03:31.002 --> 03:33.539
- We've got to get to him
before he gets to her.

03:33.672 --> 03:35.833
- How?

03:35.966 --> 03:39.629
- Well, he broke in here
looking for something.

03:39.761 --> 03:43.128
If we could figure out what that is,
why he wanted it...

03:43.265 --> 03:46.052
- We've been all through that cabinet.
Nothing's missing.

03:46.184 --> 03:48.516
- He could've broken into that
with a pen knife.

03:48.645 --> 03:51.603
Instead he uses
his unique murder weapon?

03:52.899 --> 03:55.891
What if he wanted us
to know it was him,

03:56.027 --> 03:58.359
so we'd focus only on the cabinet?

04:03.201 --> 04:06.443
- Instead of what he was really after.

04:12.711 --> 04:14.372
- He's got a full medical kit.

04:14.546 --> 04:17.083
He must be going to see Noelle.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.588
We need to follow him.

04:18.717 --> 04:21.584
Can you call the roadblocks?
Make sure that they let Brentner through?

04:25.140 --> 04:27.256
- Hey, Laverne,
update the roadblocks, all right?

04:27.392 --> 04:28.472
It's a tan sedan.

04:28.602 --> 04:33.141
The driver's name is Joseph Brentner.
He's armed, very dangerous.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.934
He's already killed a cop so shoot to--

04:35.108 --> 04:37.724
- Armed and dangerous?
Shoot to kill? Take him out?

04:37.861 --> 04:39.351
- Well, uh, uh, Laverne,
you're breaking up.

04:39.529 --> 04:41.315
Listen, just update
the damn roadblocks, all right?

04:42.908 --> 04:44.773
Yeah, take him out.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.491
Blow his head off.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.870
He killed a cop.

04:51.917 --> 04:55.956
(theme music)

05:28.411 --> 05:29.867
- Noelle?

05:33.792 --> 05:35.282
Noelle?

05:35.836 --> 05:37.542
(gun cocks)
- Police.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.631
Keep calling to her.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.840
- Noelle, are you there?

05:45.095 --> 05:46.335
- She should be here.

05:51.560 --> 05:54.267
- I'll check downstairs.
- Okay, I'll check up.

05:55.230 --> 05:57.721
Wait here with him.
- Yeah.

06:03.238 --> 06:07.106
You better pray that your girlfriend
can bring my friend back to life.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.307
- I knew I clipped you good.

06:40.483 --> 06:44.101
Hush, it's okay. I'm the police.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.235
It's okay.

06:46.364 --> 06:48.741
(yelpS)
Hush.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.152
Hush.

06:51.161 --> 06:53.948
Hush,hush.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.830
- Audrey, I know why we brought Nathan,

07:00.962 --> 07:03.339
but why are we keeping her?

07:03.506 --> 07:05.542
- We might need her.

07:05.675 --> 07:07.256
(Duke): What's the plan?

07:07.802 --> 07:10.635
- I don't know,
but we can't just sit here.

07:10.764 --> 07:12.004
There's got to be something.

07:12.098 --> 07:15.886
- Noelle's gone, so there's no way
to bring back the chief, right?

07:30.450 --> 07:33.157
- Of course, her sister.
We gotta find her.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.197
Now.
- Why?

07:35.413 --> 07:36.789
- Troubles run in families,

07:36.915 --> 07:38.997
so if Noelle can bring people
back from the dead,

07:39.167 --> 07:41.032
so can her sister.
What's her name?

07:41.086 --> 07:43.077
- Moira, but, uh, she...
she doesn't have a Trouble.

07:43.213 --> 07:44.544
That's why she was using Noelle.

07:44.673 --> 07:47.415
- Okay, well, then
we'll bring out Moira's Trouble.

07:47.550 --> 07:50.417
- You can do that?
- We can try.

07:51.388 --> 07:54.175
Okay, this is Moira's.

07:54.307 --> 07:57.515
There's a bunch of these names and addresses.
What does this mean?

07:57.727 --> 08:00.969
- She had a cleaning service.
It's like a hit list.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.728
She scratched off all the names
of the people she was extorting.

08:02.857 --> 08:05.348
- These three here,
they're marked "on vacation".

08:05.485 --> 08:07.316
This is the house
that we're in now.

08:07.445 --> 08:10.903
- That's why she came here.
She knew it'd be empty.

08:11.074 --> 08:12.905
It's a perfect place to hide.

08:13.034 --> 08:14.615
- All right, well,
my money is that Moira's

08:14.744 --> 08:16.860
at one of these other houses.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.079
We need to split up.

08:19.207 --> 08:21.072
You and Duke take his truck.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.574
Go to the Wentworth house.

08:22.711 --> 08:24.827
I'm gonna take your car,
check out the other house.

08:31.761 --> 08:33.672
- On the other side, Grady.

08:33.805 --> 08:35.215
(cellphone ringing)

08:39.060 --> 08:41.551
Audrey?
- Hey, listen, I don't have time to explain.

08:41.688 --> 08:44.771
| just need you
to babysit a guy for me.

08:44.899 --> 08:46.150
- Is everything okay?

08:47.402 --> 08:49.108
- No.
- Okay.

08:49.237 --> 08:52.104
I could use a change of scenery anyway.
Where are you?

08:52.240 --> 08:54.231
(cellphone ringing)

08:57.370 --> 08:59.952
Audrey?
- Uh... l'll text you the address.

09:09.090 --> 09:12.082
(ringing continues)

09:16.848 --> 09:17.963
Hello?

09:18.099 --> 09:19.680
- Audrey?

09:19.809 --> 09:21.345
- Jordan.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.469
- What are you doing on this phone?

09:23.605 --> 09:26.893
- ljust... I found it.
It was left in my car.

09:27.025 --> 09:28.481
Is it Nathan's?
- What's going on?

09:28.610 --> 09:30.475
I keep calling Nathan,
and he doesn't answer.

09:30.612 --> 09:32.068
Is he okay?
- I don't know.

09:32.197 --> 09:34.438
I haven't spoken to him.
I just got in.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.236
Hey, listen, I really gotta go.

09:52.258 --> 09:54.544
I'm sorry for your loss,

09:54.677 --> 09:57.054
but I need you to tell me
about Noelle's Trouble.

09:57.222 --> 09:59.838
- Moira was the one killing people.
Noelle was just bringing them back.

09:59.974 --> 10:02.010
- Tell me how Noelle's Trouble started.

10:03.394 --> 10:06.386
- Noelle and l were on a call
a few months ago.

10:06.648 --> 10:08.980
I got clipped by a drunk driver, and...

10:10.568 --> 10:11.603
I died.

10:12.570 --> 10:16.904
Noelle said seeing someone she loved dead,

10:17.033 --> 10:18.614
that's what brought on her Trouble.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.491
- So she touched you
when you were dead?

10:20.620 --> 10:22.201
- Yeah, at sunset.

10:22.330 --> 10:25.663
She took on my injury,
and then we both healed together.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.283
- That?
- Is a gunshot wound.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.122
She saved my life twice.

10:30.255 --> 10:32.120
- That's why you and Noelle
have the same scars.

10:32.257 --> 10:35.249
- This is all Moira's fault.
- Then why did she keep helping her?

10:35.385 --> 10:37.717
Why didn't she just turn her in?
- They have a crazy bond.

10:37.887 --> 10:39.263
They grew up as orphans.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.011
- What happened to their parents?

10:41.141 --> 10:44.304
- Her mom died of cancer
when she was really young,

10:44.477 --> 10:46.263
and their dad did a pretty good job
of raising them

10:46.396 --> 10:47.761
until a car accident killed him.

10:49.440 --> 10:52.523
Something happened
to those sisters that day.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.517
- What?

10:54.654 --> 10:56.940
- Noelle never told me about it.

10:57.073 --> 10:59.564
I finally took a look
at the police report,

10:59.701 --> 11:02.989
and it said that it looked like

11:03.121 --> 11:05.908
they were all ejected
from the vehicle.

11:06.040 --> 11:09.749
They found Moira and Noelle
standing in the road, just in shock.

11:10.587 --> 11:12.703
Their dad was dead.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.715
- I checked that.

11:21.848 --> 11:23.713
- I'm checking them again.

11:23.850 --> 11:25.932
- There's no keys missing.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.800
- Get that light over here.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.802
- You find something?

11:33.818 --> 11:36.230
The edge of that key's all shiny.

11:36.362 --> 11:37.568
It's new.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.904
- It's a copy, and we didn't make it.

11:41.326 --> 11:43.237
- So which key is it?

11:49.209 --> 11:50.915
Our fishing shack.

11:51.044 --> 11:54.628
- Duke, I'm at the Fenmore house now.
I'll let you know if I find anything.

12:03.681 --> 12:05.467
(door creaking)

12:09.062 --> 12:11.098
Moira?

12:23.910 --> 12:25.992
Stop!
(gunshot)

12:26.120 --> 12:27.326
Police!

12:27.455 --> 12:28.695
- Don't kill me.

12:28.831 --> 12:31.493
- Moira, I'm not gonna kill you.
Just move to the wall.

12:35.088 --> 12:39.548
- Look, all I wanted was the money.
That guy wasn't supposed to die.

12:39.717 --> 12:41.127
He was supposed to come back to life
like the others.

12:41.302 --> 12:44.510
- The guy at the cabin,
he was supposed to come back to life?

12:44.639 --> 12:48.427
- The cop got shot?
I didn't have anything to do with that.

12:48.559 --> 12:50.140
- I know you didn't.
That was Noelle.

12:50.270 --> 12:53.262
- What? My sister didn't shoot him.

12:53.398 --> 12:55.104
She ran away.

12:56.943 --> 12:58.524
- We have an eyewitness.

12:58.653 --> 13:01.144
- Listen, listen.

13:01.281 --> 13:05.945
Put me and Noelle on a bus out of town,
and I'll tell you who did it.

13:10.373 --> 13:12.409
- Who shot Nathan?

13:12.542 --> 13:14.078
(grunts)

13:15.837 --> 13:19.329
- The black cop in the hat.
I saw it all.

13:19.716 --> 13:21.001
- What?

13:21.175 --> 13:23.336
- They were outside talking at the car,

13:23.469 --> 13:27.212
and all of a sudden,
he shot your cop friend right in the chest.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.097
- You're lying.

13:30.268 --> 13:32.008
- The weird thing,

13:32.145 --> 13:34.727
it was like the white cop
didn't even feel any pain.

13:34.897 --> 13:37.434
He just kept talking after he was shot.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.562
- What did he say?

13:41.654 --> 13:43.770
- "You're the bolt-gun killer."

13:43.948 --> 13:47.691
Then the other cop shot him again.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.570
(cellphone ringing)

13:52.707 --> 13:54.572
- lt's Audrey.
What's up?

13:54.709 --> 13:56.791
- Duke, don't react
to what I'm about to say.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.375
You understand me?

13:58.504 --> 14:00.620
l have Moira here.

14:01.883 --> 14:03.544
She told me that Tommy killed Nathan.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.837
She told me that Tommy's
the bolt-gun killer.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.760
- Are you sure?

14:08.890 --> 14:12.007
- Her story makes sense,
and Tommy's been acting weird all day.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.059
- Okay.
- You keep him away.

14:15.188 --> 14:18.100
l'll trigger Moira's curse
and I'll get her to bring Nathan back,

14:18.232 --> 14:19.517
and when he's okay...
- Yeah.

14:19.650 --> 14:22.892
- We take Tommy down.
- Got it.

14:25.406 --> 14:28.489
She struck out.
That ups the odds that Moira's probably here.

14:28.659 --> 14:31.275
We should keep looking for her.
- Took her that long to say that?

14:31.412 --> 14:32.948
- Girls. She was...

14:33.122 --> 14:34.953
still talking when I hung up.

14:35.124 --> 14:36.580
- Yeah, yeah, I bet.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.370
All right, let's find Moira.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.409
- Yeah.

14:42.465 --> 14:44.171
Wait, you know,

14:44.300 --> 14:47.758
what if Moira has a gun, you know?

14:47.887 --> 14:50.720
You got like a backup piece
you can lend me?

14:50.848 --> 14:52.258
- Nah, nah, nah, nah.

14:52.392 --> 14:55.304
No can do. Regulations, you know?
You're not a cop.

14:55.436 --> 14:59.805
- Whatever.
Why don't you go look inside,

14:59.941 --> 15:02.227
and I'll keep poking around
out here.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.396
- Sounds good to me.

15:23.798 --> 15:25.459
- Where's Nathan?

15:25.591 --> 15:27.001
- How did you find me?

15:27.135 --> 15:29.717
- The phone I gave Nathan
has a locator app on it.

15:29.846 --> 15:31.802
Where is he?
- Go home.

15:31.931 --> 15:36.095
- I can tell something's wrong.
Just tell me where he is, please.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.606
(car beeping, doors unlocking)

15:45.528 --> 15:46.813
- He's been shot.

15:50.158 --> 15:51.648
- Oh, my God.

15:55.163 --> 15:57.779
Who did this?
- He'll pay.

15:58.416 --> 16:00.327
But first, I need to bring Nathan back.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.041
- You can do that?

16:02.170 --> 16:04.035
- There's a resurrection Trouble.

16:04.172 --> 16:06.003
If the person touches him
before sunset,

16:06.132 --> 16:08.248
then he'll come back
when the sun goes down.

16:08.384 --> 16:09.749
- So what are you waiting for?

16:10.678 --> 16:13.340
- The woman who has it
is right there, dead.

16:13.473 --> 16:16.306
Her sister's inside,
but her Trouble isn't active yet.

16:16.434 --> 16:17.719
We have to trigger it.

16:17.894 --> 16:21.557
- It usually takes some kind of
emotional trauma to do that.

16:22.607 --> 16:24.347
What are you gonna do?

16:27.945 --> 16:29.526
- Traumatize her.

16:32.617 --> 16:33.777
- What are you doing?

16:37.788 --> 16:38.948
- I told you.

16:39.081 --> 16:42.824
You know, this chick could be dangerous,
and since you won't give me a gun...

16:43.920 --> 16:46.206
- So you're gonna chop
her head off with a hatchet?

16:46.380 --> 16:48.962
- Better than flipping her off.

17:06.150 --> 17:07.526
What happened to regulations?

17:09.195 --> 17:11.481
- Screw regulations.

17:13.199 --> 17:14.564
- Thank you.

17:35.304 --> 17:36.885
- I'm sorry it's gotta be like this.

17:37.014 --> 17:39.266
- Like what?

17:51.487 --> 17:53.068
- She didn't make it.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.285
- Perfect.

18:00.746 --> 18:03.579
She couldn't even save herself.

18:06.627 --> 18:09.664
- Did you feel anything just now,

18:09.797 --> 18:12.880
physically, when you saw your sister?

18:18.639 --> 18:19.879
- No.

18:20.641 --> 18:22.506
Was I supposed to?

18:30.151 --> 18:32.608
- Can't tell if she even cares
that her sister's dead.

18:32.737 --> 18:35.854
Think it worked?
- I don't know.

18:35.990 --> 18:38.606
What did it feel like for you
when your Trouble started?

18:38.743 --> 18:42.235
- I had no idea until I touched someone,
and they screamed.

18:42.371 --> 18:44.362
- So Moira won't know
when it kicks in

18:44.498 --> 18:47.035
and neither will we.
- Not until sunset,

18:48.085 --> 18:50.997
and then it'll be too late
to try something else.

18:53.341 --> 18:55.206
- l have 47 minutes.

18:59.347 --> 19:01.554
There is a way to know
for sure about Moira's curse.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.724
Duke will react
if he touches her blood.

19:05.853 --> 19:08.344
- So call him.
Get him over here.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.062
- lt's dangerous.

19:10.191 --> 19:11.397
He's with Tommy.

19:12.818 --> 19:14.524
- So?

19:18.032 --> 19:20.865
- Moira's not in here.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.029
- Yeah, we need to be sure.

19:24.705 --> 19:27.913
- A lot riding on finding her.

19:28.042 --> 19:29.907
How was Colorado?

19:30.044 --> 19:31.454
- Hilly.

19:33.214 --> 19:35.751
- You guys were investigating
the Colorado Kid case, right?

19:38.969 --> 19:40.630
- Yeah, we didn't find anything.

19:41.806 --> 19:45.298
27 years leaves a trail pretty cold.

19:45.434 --> 19:47.811
- Yeah, I know the feeling.

19:47.937 --> 19:50.178
Worked a couple of cold cases
in my day.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.267
Very frustrating.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.229
But you guys didn't find anything?

19:56.612 --> 20:00.025
- You're right. She's not here.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.111
Let's go look someplace else.

20:05.079 --> 20:07.035
- You're a bad liar.

20:07.915 --> 20:09.246
(gun cocks)

20:10.543 --> 20:11.658
Ah.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.331
- You're the bolt-gun killer.

20:16.590 --> 20:18.455
Nathan figured it out.

20:19.343 --> 20:21.049
That's why you killed him.

20:21.178 --> 20:23.669
- Bolt-gun killer.

20:25.516 --> 20:27.131
I don't like that.

20:27.268 --> 20:29.384
It's too on the nose.

20:29.520 --> 20:30.805
- Why are you killing women?

20:30.938 --> 20:32.644
- It is my turn.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.766
You and Audrey,
did you find the Cogans?

20:36.902 --> 20:38.608
- Dad was dead.

20:38.779 --> 20:42.192
Mom's got Alzheimer's,
doesn't know anything about the Colorado Kid.

20:44.118 --> 20:46.325
Why are you so interested
in a drifter

20:46.454 --> 20:49.366
that died almost 30 years ago?
- Shut your mouth!

20:50.207 --> 20:53.449
Put the damn gun down.
It's not loaded.

20:55.171 --> 20:56.331
- I know.

21:20.154 --> 21:22.236
You're Troubled.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.192
(both grunting)

21:34.168 --> 21:37.160
(groaning)

21:40.174 --> 21:41.664
(groans)

21:42.635 --> 21:44.045
(yelpS)

21:48.557 --> 21:50.058
That frickin' hurt!

21:50.226 --> 21:52.057
(car engine starting)

21:52.186 --> 21:54.222
- I left my keys in my car.
(tires screeching)

21:54.355 --> 21:56.266
- We'll go after him in mine.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.522
- We can't go after him.

21:58.651 --> 22:02.644
Audrey needs your help right now
to save Nathan.

22:08.869 --> 22:10.405
- What are you doing?

22:10.538 --> 22:12.244
- You're gonna bring him back to life.

22:12.373 --> 22:13.579
- Oh, for Pete's sake.

22:13.707 --> 22:15.663
You're trying to trigger
my family's Trouble?

22:15.793 --> 22:18.751
- lt should've worked.
Most people love their sister.

22:18.879 --> 22:20.870
- Well, you don't know
what my sister did.

22:21.006 --> 22:23.497
- The night of the accident?
- What do you know about that?

22:23.634 --> 22:25.841
- I know something bad happened.
- No.

22:25.970 --> 22:29.929
Actually something didn't happen.

22:30.057 --> 22:32.218
Noelle...

22:32.393 --> 22:35.055
didn't save Dad.

22:37.690 --> 22:41.057
- She had it when the Troubles
were here last time.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.275
She was...
- Eight.

22:44.154 --> 22:46.315
Got it when my mom died.

22:47.741 --> 22:51.575
Became our new little family secret
between her, me, and Dad.

22:53.622 --> 22:55.658
She brought her hamster
back to life,

22:55.791 --> 22:58.282
even a bird found on the street.

22:58.419 --> 23:01.582
When it came to my father
lying dead in a ditch...

23:01.714 --> 23:04.626
she needed to bring him back.

23:04.758 --> 23:06.623
She wouldn't.

23:07.928 --> 23:09.759
Said she was afraid.

23:11.098 --> 23:13.965
Sat in the dirt, cried,

23:15.811 --> 23:17.802
and let him die.

23:18.981 --> 23:22.018
- She was just a kid, Moira.
- So was I.

23:33.621 --> 23:35.157
- The shack seems quiet.

23:35.289 --> 23:37.780
- When was the last time
we were out here?

23:37.917 --> 23:39.157
- Over a year ago, I think.

23:44.048 --> 23:45.754
(bird cry)

23:52.598 --> 23:55.135
- Jordan might not get Duke back
before sunset.

23:57.519 --> 23:59.555
- I'm guessing that's a problem.

24:05.861 --> 24:07.101
- Noelle's Trouble came back

24:07.237 --> 24:09.273
when she saw someone
she loved die, right?

24:11.158 --> 24:13.365
Should be the same way with you.

24:14.328 --> 24:16.740
- You gonna kill someone I love?

24:21.335 --> 24:22.916
Who?

24:24.463 --> 24:27.205
- The only person
you care about now...

24:27.341 --> 24:28.831
you.

24:33.097 --> 24:34.428
- Doesn't even make sense.

24:34.598 --> 24:37.089
- If I shoot you in the right place,
you won't die right away.

24:37.226 --> 24:38.966
It'll take a few minutes.

24:39.103 --> 24:43.187
That's plenty of time to save Nathan
when your Trouble's activated.

24:45.150 --> 24:46.651
- You're bluffing.

24:46.777 --> 24:49.689
- | only need you alive till sundown.

24:51.073 --> 24:52.188
- You're not a killer.

24:52.324 --> 24:55.657
- You have no idea what I am...

24:58.288 --> 25:00.415
and I want Nathan back.

25:02.418 --> 25:04.454
(gunshot)
(ominous music)

25:22.688 --> 25:23.973
Where's Tommy?

25:24.106 --> 25:26.313
- Tommy got away for now.

25:27.943 --> 25:29.228
- What's going on?

25:29.361 --> 25:31.101
- Trying to activate her Trouble.

25:31.739 --> 25:33.570
- Did it work?
- You tell me, Duke.

25:33.699 --> 25:34.905
Can you test her blood?

25:35.034 --> 25:36.490
Tell me if she's Troubled now?

25:38.871 --> 25:39.701
- What?

25:42.332 --> 25:44.744
(metal clattering)

25:47.629 --> 25:49.369
No, get away from me.

25:49.506 --> 25:51.337
Get away from me!

25:51.508 --> 25:52.884
Ow!

26:04.980 --> 26:06.641
- She's not Troubled.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.244
- Whose boat is that?

26:23.373 --> 26:25.113
- And where's the captain?

26:25.250 --> 26:26.956
(Tommy): Captain's right behind you.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.122
Put the guns down.

26:33.008 --> 26:34.873
Turn around slowly.

26:39.640 --> 26:41.926
Hey, hey, hey.

26:42.726 --> 26:44.136
What are you fellas doing here?

26:44.269 --> 26:45.475
- Going fishing.

26:46.355 --> 26:47.470
- With guns?

26:47.940 --> 26:51.273
- Ah, you're right, bad idea.

26:52.402 --> 26:53.653
Let's head on home.

26:53.779 --> 26:55.815
- Wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

26:55.948 --> 26:58.735
You came out here looking
for some sort of trouble.

26:58.867 --> 27:01.279
Come on, I'm a cop. What's up?

27:01.411 --> 27:02.992
-We||, uh...

27:03.122 --> 27:06.034
we thought the bolt-gun killer
was out here.

27:06.166 --> 27:07.747
(laughs)

27:07.876 --> 27:10.162
(laughter)

27:11.505 --> 27:13.245
- Seriously?

27:15.926 --> 27:18.292
Some good work, fellas.

27:19.555 --> 27:21.591
Damn good work.

27:23.725 --> 27:26.307
- You thought I was bluffing?

27:27.146 --> 27:28.306
- Yeah.

27:28.438 --> 27:30.394
- That's why it might not have worked,

27:30.524 --> 27:32.185
because you didn't believe me.

27:32.818 --> 27:35.560
So this time, I am going to shoot you.

27:37.239 --> 27:38.570
- Audrey, what are you doing?

27:38.740 --> 27:41.197
- Duke, we are running out of time,
all right?

27:41.326 --> 27:43.066
I need to do something.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.577
- Does it make you feel crazy?

27:47.666 --> 27:52.205
'Cause that's how I felt that night,
waking up in my dad's truck

27:52.337 --> 27:57.923
with my sister crying next to me
and my dad gone forever.

27:58.051 --> 28:01.714
- You woke up in a truck?
- Yeah.

28:01.847 --> 28:03.963
- But the police report said

28:04.099 --> 28:06.431
that it looked like you were ejected
from the vehicle.

28:06.560 --> 28:09.973
- l was knocked unconscious
in the truck.

28:10.105 --> 28:14.189
One of my dad's toolboxes hit me
in the back of the head.

28:22.451 --> 28:24.362
- Audrey, what are you doing?

28:24.494 --> 28:26.030
(handcuffs clinking and clanking)

28:26.205 --> 28:27.490
- Show me where.

28:45.140 --> 28:46.801
Moira, you weren't unconscious.

28:46.934 --> 28:49.926
You were dead.
- What?

28:50.062 --> 28:53.020
- Your sister, she has the same scar.

28:54.524 --> 28:56.731
She brought you back.

29:04.451 --> 29:05.691
- No.

29:09.081 --> 29:11.037
Because that would mean...

29:15.796 --> 29:18.663
that would mean
that she saved me

29:18.799 --> 29:20.835
and not our dad.

29:20.968 --> 29:23.710
- Why didn't she bring your dad back too?

29:25.430 --> 29:27.341
- Because she couldn't.

29:28.892 --> 29:30.723
Dad...

29:30.894 --> 29:34.261
always told her that

29:34.398 --> 29:37.140
if she saved two lives in one day

29:37.985 --> 29:40.021
that it might not work,

29:40.737 --> 29:42.819
could be fatal,

29:43.782 --> 29:45.864
so she could only save...

29:46.952 --> 29:48.658
one of us.

29:49.329 --> 29:53.197
- But she chose you, her sister.

29:53.333 --> 29:55.164
- Oh, my God.

29:58.922 --> 30:02.289
All these years,
I've made her life hell.

30:02.426 --> 30:03.666
(hyperventilating)

30:03.802 --> 30:06.919
All... all because...

30:07.097 --> 30:08.758
she saved my life.

30:09.182 --> 30:12.174
- Do you love your sister now, Moira?

30:12.311 --> 30:13.676
- Yes.

30:15.314 --> 30:18.602
The wrong one of us is dead.

30:24.531 --> 30:27.489
Oh, my God,
I hope I'm not too late.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.454
I'm so sorry.

30:47.262 --> 30:48.468
(crying)

30:58.690 --> 31:00.146
- Nathan...

31:00.942 --> 31:03.228
l was the one that was supposed to...

31:06.740 --> 31:09.607
l was supposed to go.

31:15.165 --> 31:16.996
I've always loved you.

31:22.047 --> 31:24.629
| always will love you.

31:32.641 --> 31:35.633
(crying)

31:48.740 --> 31:49.900
- Audrey...

31:57.707 --> 31:59.322
(groaning)

32:01.128 --> 32:03.164
(strained groaning)

32:11.930 --> 32:13.466
- Hey, Parker.

32:13.598 --> 32:15.429
(laughs)

32:16.393 --> 32:20.261
Where's the funeral?
(laughs)

32:21.148 --> 32:23.104
(sniffling)

32:29.990 --> 32:31.105
Hi.

32:31.908 --> 32:34.024
- l was so scared.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.369
- I'm okay.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.951
(gaSDS)

32:44.796 --> 32:47.003
(groans weakly)

32:47.132 --> 32:49.214
- Oh, my God, Moira.

32:50.635 --> 32:53.843
- She saved you.
- And him too?

32:53.972 --> 32:56.133
She brought two people back at once?
lt'll kill her.

32:57.559 --> 32:59.470
(moaning weakly)

33:02.147 --> 33:07.141
- You saved my life and not Dad's.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.357
Why didn't you tell me?

33:11.490 --> 33:14.482
- I didn't want you to feel guilty.

33:14.618 --> 33:16.404
- Oh, Noelle.

33:18.079 --> 33:19.660
- Should I have told you?

33:21.333 --> 33:23.073
- Things...

33:23.251 --> 33:25.458
would have been so much better...

33:26.713 --> 33:29.250
with my sister.

33:29.508 --> 33:32.295
(sniffles)

33:42.687 --> 33:45.144
- Parker, where's Tommy?

33:49.194 --> 33:53.028
I made the Grady connection
with Tommy's GPS history.

33:53.156 --> 33:54.737
There's a lot of addresses in here.

33:54.908 --> 33:56.819
It's gonna take all night
to cover them all.

33:56.952 --> 33:58.988
- Then we better get going.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.044
- Always liked this place.

34:17.180 --> 34:19.262
So many memories.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.849
Now I gotta burn it down.

34:23.979 --> 34:26.345
- What memories?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

34:26.481 --> 34:28.267
You're confused.

34:28.400 --> 34:32.313
You see, it is I who have you tied up.

34:32.445 --> 34:33.776
| ask all the questions.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.987
- We haven't answered
your questions all night,

34:36.116 --> 34:40.075
and we're not gonna start now.
(groans)

34:43.790 --> 34:46.031
I'm really gonna enjoy killing you.

34:46.167 --> 34:48.658
- I don't think so, Vince.

34:48.795 --> 34:50.035
I think it's my turn.

34:50.171 --> 34:52.002
- Oh, is it?
- Yeah.

34:52.924 --> 34:54.630
- Where's the Colorado Kid?

34:54.759 --> 34:57.922
- This is getting boring.
- Oh, boring, huh?

34:58.054 --> 34:59.715
(groaning)

35:06.730 --> 35:08.266
Tell me where the barn is.

35:12.527 --> 35:13.983
- What do you know about the barn?

35:14.112 --> 35:16.979
- I know enough to know
that I want to go there.

35:17.115 --> 35:18.400
- Good luck.

35:18.533 --> 35:21.149
Only one person
ever goes to the barn,

35:21.286 --> 35:23.948
and it comes for her.

35:25.332 --> 35:26.993
- Audrey.

35:29.252 --> 35:33.336
So why don't you tell me how it...
(car approaching)

35:56.279 --> 35:57.519
- Are you okay?

35:57.656 --> 35:59.362
- lt's Tommy. Quick!

35:59.491 --> 36:01.777
- He went that way.

36:03.703 --> 36:05.944
- Don't hit him.
Take out the engine.

36:23.765 --> 36:25.175
What did we hit?

36:25.308 --> 36:26.923
- Fuel tanks maybe.

36:31.022 --> 36:32.887
- I needed to talk to him.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.686
I needed to know what he knew.

37:00.719 --> 37:03.961
So you got everything you need?
- Yeah, everything.

37:06.725 --> 37:09.967
- When she wakes up,
she's gonna be somewhere totally new.

37:11.187 --> 37:13.564
- We both are.
It's gonna be a good thing.

37:14.649 --> 37:17.015
- You can come back
when the Troubles are over.

37:17.152 --> 37:19.234
- Thank you.

37:23.324 --> 37:26.191
(strumming ukulele)

37:32.459 --> 37:36.077
- Nathan's welcome-back-from-the-dead
party's in full swing.

37:36.212 --> 37:38.669
- What's the public reason
for the party?

37:38.798 --> 37:40.004
- Taco Tuesday.

37:40.133 --> 37:41.794
- Oh.
(chuckles)

37:42.469 --> 37:44.881
- Not thinking about skipping out, are you?

37:45.054 --> 37:46.510
- I wouldn't dream of it.

37:46.639 --> 37:48.470
I need a little more fun in my life.

37:48.600 --> 37:51.307
- Ah, I think I'm starting
to rub off on you.

37:54.856 --> 37:57.017
- About Colorado...

37:57.150 --> 37:59.266
- Yeah, it all worked out for the best.

38:00.320 --> 38:03.562
We made it home in time
to save Nathan's life.

38:04.824 --> 38:06.860
It's all good.

38:08.953 --> 38:12.195
- Ooh, awkwardness, tension.

38:12.332 --> 38:16.166
I'd ask some intrusive questions,
but I'm off duty.

38:17.378 --> 38:20.541
Okay, okay,
I'll ask some intrusive questions.

38:20.757 --> 38:22.418
- You know...

38:23.301 --> 38:25.383
I think I'm gonna
let Audrey catch you up.

38:26.471 --> 38:27.711
Tacos aren't gonna
make themselves now.

38:27.847 --> 38:30.930
(plays ukulele)

38:33.770 --> 38:35.886
- l was just fooling around, Audrey.

38:36.105 --> 38:39.063
You don't have to talk to me right now
if you don't want to.

38:39.192 --> 38:41.228
- The Colorado Kid is my son.

38:41.361 --> 38:43.522
Or Sarah's.

38:43.696 --> 38:45.402
He's not my...

38:47.826 --> 38:49.657
He's my son.

38:49.828 --> 38:51.284
- Wow.

38:52.038 --> 38:55.371
l'll clear my schedule for you.
- Don't.

38:56.209 --> 38:59.997
I'm gonna try to find him,
so I'm gonna be kind of busy.

39:00.171 --> 39:01.832
- Audrey, you only have...

39:02.006 --> 39:03.587
- A few weeks.

39:03.758 --> 39:07.626
So, like I said, I'm gonna be busy.

39:08.471 --> 39:09.756
- I'm sure you will.

39:09.931 --> 39:13.469
- Hey. You guys coming in?

39:13.601 --> 39:15.978
Apparently they're making tacos
in my honour.

39:16.145 --> 39:18.761
- Sure. We'll talk later.

39:26.155 --> 39:28.441
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:29.158 --> 39:31.285
- I never got to ask.

39:33.288 --> 39:36.030
How did it go in Colorado?

39:36.165 --> 39:38.156
- It's a long story.

39:41.170 --> 39:43.582
Did they recover Tommy's body yet?

39:43.715 --> 39:45.046
- No.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.961
With the tides, we may never.

39:50.054 --> 39:51.919
- We finally find him,

39:52.056 --> 39:54.638
and we're left with more questions
than when we started.

39:54.767 --> 39:57.053
- Did Tommy have the tattoo?

39:57.186 --> 40:00.019
The guy on the surveillance
clearly wasn't Tommy.

40:00.148 --> 40:01.854
What was his Trouble?

40:03.109 --> 40:05.225
Why was he taking parts from women?

40:05.361 --> 40:08.899
- How did he even know
about the Colorado Kid? Who was he?

40:09.032 --> 40:10.568
- We'll figure it out.

40:10.700 --> 40:12.861
- Nathan, I want to tell you

40:12.994 --> 40:15.656
everything that happened
in Colorado.

40:15.788 --> 40:19.622
- Maybe we can skip the party,
go somewhere, talk.

40:24.547 --> 40:26.538
- Now's not a good time.

40:53.743 --> 40:55.984
- The party's winding down.

40:57.455 --> 40:59.286
- Are you okay?

40:59.415 --> 41:01.952
- All things taken together, no.

41:02.085 --> 41:04.417
(chuckles)

41:05.922 --> 41:09.210
Ever since you returned to Haven,

41:09.342 --> 41:11.754
I've helped to deceive you.

41:11.886 --> 41:15.629
I had good intentions... to protect you,

41:15.765 --> 41:18.177
to help you survive this chaos...

41:18.726 --> 41:20.887
But that doesn't make it right.

41:22.689 --> 41:24.896
l'm truly sorry, Audrey.

41:25.525 --> 41:28.358
I wanted to say that to you
before you...

41:29.862 --> 41:31.398
before you go.

41:38.413 --> 41:39.744
- Tell me about Sarah.

41:42.834 --> 41:44.950
- She was tough, independent...

41:46.629 --> 41:49.006
You know, you always come back
with a different name,

41:49.132 --> 41:52.340
but underneath,
you're always somehow the same.

41:52.468 --> 41:56.006
- I know that Sarah
was the Colorado Kid's mother.

41:58.099 --> 42:00.090
Who was the father?

42:00.268 --> 42:03.476
- Sarah never told anyone
who the father was.

42:03.604 --> 42:05.765
(shimmering tone, eerie music)

42:13.239 --> 42:14.604
- Is everything okay?

42:14.824 --> 42:18.237
- Everything is just
how it's supposed to be.

42:18.369 --> 42:21.031
Let's join the party, shall we?

42:58.242 --> 43:01.075
Subtitling: CNST, Montreal
