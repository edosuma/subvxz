18:25.200 --> 18:27.166
[Crashing]

18:28.066 --> 18:29.466
Ooh!

18:37.066 --> 18:38.233
Ouch.

18:39.300 --> 18:42.433
Attract, repel--
I'm shutting this baby down.

18:42.466 --> 18:48.300
Computer: Your program does
not allow the magnetic field
to be terminated manually.

18:48.333 --> 18:50.416
You must use the remote control.

18:50.450 --> 18:53.266
The remote control?

18:53.416 --> 18:57.333
But I don't even
know where it is!

19:02.250 --> 19:04.283
Ok. Hand it over.

19:05.333 --> 19:06.450
How do you do that?

19:06.483 --> 19:08.166
Well, you see, Dee Dee,

19:08.200 --> 19:11.450
once again, I have
exercised my genius
scientific abilities

19:11.483 --> 19:17.200
by successfully
creating a magnetic field
to keep<i>you</i><i>me.</i>

19:17.233 --> 19:22.000
But it seems that
I have made one
slight miscalculation.

19:22.033 --> 19:23.383
And without
the added weight
of my chair,

19:23.416 --> 19:27.433
you weigh more than
me, enabling you
to move me about,

19:27.466 --> 19:30.133
at your own free
will, of course.

19:30.166 --> 19:33.183
[Claps]
Neat!
[Crash]

19:36.433 --> 19:39.416
Now give me
that remote!

19:57.400 --> 20:00.450
Ooo, ow, ooo, ow,
eee, ow, ooo, ow, ooo!

20:03.233 --> 20:07.133
Dee Dee, stop it
this instant!

20:09.200 --> 20:11.100
Dee Dee!

20:19.366 --> 20:22.266
Dee Dee!
Stop it right now!

20:25.266 --> 20:27.233
Dee Dee?

20:29.266 --> 20:32.133
[Laughing]

20:33.250 --> 20:36.100
Dee Dee! Stop!

20:36.416 --> 20:39.100
Dee Dee! Stop!

20:42.016 --> 20:44.283
Aah, shut up.
[Smack]

20:44.316 --> 20:45.416
[Crash]

20:45.450 --> 20:48.483
Why, you! You are
in for it now!

20:49.016 --> 20:52.200
[Both yelling at once]

20:58.250 --> 21:01.183
Quie-e-e-e-t!

21:03.383 --> 21:06.216
Now, I want you
both to make up.

21:06.250 --> 21:07.433
Ok!

21:08.466 --> 21:10.166
Hmm!

21:13.200 --> 21:17.366
Dexter! I said
make up<i>now!</i>

21:20.200 --> 21:22.016
Oh! Oh!

21:22.050 --> 21:23.283
[Laughs]

21:23.316 --> 21:30.016
Eh, sorry about that.
Now, that's more like it.

21:30.050 --> 21:32.450
Waah ha ha!
