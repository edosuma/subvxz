WEBVTT

00:02.602 --> 00:04.105
Are we ready?

00:04.138 --> 00:05.806
Yes.

00:05.839 --> 00:08.176
Please
state your name.

00:08.209 --> 00:10.511
- My name is Rachel
Marie Moreno.

00:10.544 --> 00:12.380
What
is your occupation?

00:12.413 --> 00:16.350
- I am a criminal behavior
analyst and field agent.

00:16.384 --> 00:17.185
Can you
state for the camera

00:17.218 --> 00:19.353
how long you've been
with the agency?

00:19.387 --> 00:20.188
- Seven years.

00:20.221 --> 00:21.622
And for the camera,

00:21.655 --> 00:22.723
your education.

00:22.756 --> 00:25.426
- Yale, criminal psychology.

00:25.459 --> 00:28.129
You
were successful in many
investigations?

00:28.162 --> 00:31.499
- As successful as you
can be in this field, yes.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.067
Gavin Demy,

00:33.101 --> 00:35.069
he was the other
founder of the project.

00:35.103 --> 00:36.404
What was his field of study?

00:36.437 --> 00:38.206
- Psychopharmacology.

00:38.239 --> 00:42.576
He was the lead researcher on
a joint venture with the DEA,

00:42.610 --> 00:44.612
where they studied
the side-effects

00:44.645 --> 00:47.148
of various psychotropic
and hallucinogenic

00:47.181 --> 00:49.817
drugs that were
found in the streets.

01:04.798 --> 01:06.400
He
helped develop the drug

01:06.434 --> 01:07.868
used during the proposed trials.

01:07.901 --> 01:08.869
- Yes.

01:08.902 --> 01:12.673
What was
the nature of his death?

01:20.181 --> 01:21.615
- Give me everything.

01:21.649 --> 01:23.684
What can
I do for you, man?

01:26.487 --> 01:28.589
- Give me the fucking money!

01:29.790 --> 01:31.225
- Okay.

01:31.259 --> 01:34.695
- Put the money in
the fucking bag, man!

01:39.467 --> 01:40.701
What're you looking at?

01:40.734 --> 01:43.771
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.552
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:58.586 --> 01:59.653
Put the gun down.

01:59.687 --> 02:00.821
- Back the fuck up, man!

02:00.854 --> 02:02.590
- I'm not moving.

02:02.623 --> 02:05.159
I'm not moving.
What do you need?

02:05.193 --> 02:06.460
- Hurry the fuck
up with my money!

02:06.494 --> 02:08.196
What the fuck is
taking you so long?!

02:08.229 --> 02:09.229
Put the money in
the fucking bag!

02:09.263 --> 02:10.264
- Hey, it's all right.

02:10.298 --> 02:10.931
It's all right, hey.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.300
Look at me.

02:12.333 --> 02:14.235
He's getting the money

02:14.268 --> 02:15.836
and you can walk out
of here, all right?

02:15.869 --> 02:17.171
- Take it.

02:17.205 --> 02:18.572
- Stay with me.

02:18.606 --> 02:19.273
Just breathe.

03:13.327 --> 03:13.994
Given
both of your positions

03:14.027 --> 03:15.529
as government agents,

03:15.563 --> 03:17.331
given the nature
of this project,

03:17.365 --> 03:18.632
did you ever believe
it was related?

03:18.666 --> 03:19.933
- I'd like to move on, please,

03:19.967 --> 03:22.236
to more relevant topics.

03:31.279 --> 03:32.413
You
understand that in doing this

03:32.446 --> 03:34.782
you will wave curtain rights
given the level of secrecy

03:34.815 --> 03:36.984
something like this
needs to be kept in?

03:37.017 --> 03:38.786
Yeah, I do.

03:38.819 --> 03:39.920
You
understand that in doing this

03:39.953 --> 03:43.257
you will be in direct
violation of human rights laws,

03:43.291 --> 03:45.959
among other
unethical activities?

03:45.993 --> 03:47.928
I do.

03:47.961 --> 03:50.264
Equally,
we support this project.

03:50.298 --> 03:51.432
The potential
financial implications

03:51.465 --> 03:53.967
as well as the human lives
that will benefit from this

03:54.001 --> 03:56.304
we believe outweighs the
moral and ethical dilemmas

03:56.337 --> 03:57.938
it brings up.

03:57.971 --> 03:59.273
You understand that?

03:59.307 --> 04:01.041
- I do. Thank you, sir.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.310
- Thank you.

04:02.343 --> 04:03.311
Camera off.

04:20.894 --> 04:21.728
- Hi.

04:22.630 --> 04:23.297
- Oh.

04:23.331 --> 04:24.365
Yeah.

04:32.005 --> 04:33.407
- You can leave
your bag with me.

04:33.441 --> 04:35.309
It'll be waiting in your room.

04:35.343 --> 04:36.009
- Okay.

04:44.452 --> 04:46.654
- Aaron, good to see you.

04:47.388 --> 04:49.089
Good to see you.

04:51.091 --> 04:53.394
Well, let's show you around.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.329
So,

04:55.363 --> 04:57.731
the bunks are down this way

04:57.765 --> 05:01.435
and the holding cells
are down this way.

05:01.469 --> 05:04.071
Oh, have you had a
chance to meet Jason?

05:05.439 --> 05:07.007
- Yeah, he's...

05:07.040 --> 05:10.878
Well, I actually don't
really know who he is.

05:10.911 --> 05:13.113
He kinda showed up with
this team yesterday.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.883
I think that "they" hired him.

05:23.957 --> 05:25.426
- I imagine they will be.

05:25.459 --> 05:26.760
Is everything ready?

05:26.794 --> 05:27.895
- Yeah, yeah.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.363
The holding cells
for the inmates--

05:29.397 --> 05:30.964
- Test subjects.

05:30.998 --> 05:35.035
We really need you to refer
to them as test subjects.

05:35.068 --> 05:35.903
- Yeah.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.070
Test subjects.

05:42.410 --> 05:43.043
Look,

05:43.076 --> 05:44.412
this is beyond...

05:46.113 --> 05:48.416
Well, it's a huge deal.

05:49.783 --> 05:53.921
I know that because I worked
under Gavin for years.

05:57.057 --> 06:00.861
Look, I know the depth of you
relationship with him, I do.

06:00.894 --> 06:03.030
But it's only been a year.

06:04.798 --> 06:08.936
I just need you to know what
a big deal this truly is.

06:09.937 --> 06:13.707
- It's odd to me that you
would think that I don't.

06:13.741 --> 06:15.809
Show me the control room.

06:15.843 --> 06:16.910
- So this is great.

06:16.944 --> 06:18.879
I worked really hard on this.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.814
This is the monitoring station.

06:20.848 --> 06:22.783
From here we can observe
the test subjects,

06:22.816 --> 06:24.051
keep track of their vitals.

06:24.084 --> 06:26.153
Anything that's basically
going on with them.

06:26.186 --> 06:27.521
- Okay, great.

06:28.589 --> 06:30.157
- Oh, the report log.

06:32.826 --> 06:35.095
So, it's basically
a daily log, right?

06:35.128 --> 06:38.098
You sign in, you send a message,
it goes directly to them.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.099
Anything.

06:39.132 --> 06:41.101
Alerts, concerns,

06:41.134 --> 06:44.171
anything that has to do with
the inmates or test subjects.

06:45.205 --> 06:46.440
You know, your blog.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.209
Moving right along.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.044
So they did say they
want you to leave

06:51.078 --> 06:52.145
a brief message for them,

06:52.179 --> 06:54.448
which I can help you with.

06:54.482 --> 06:57.184
They did say they want you
to do it on your own though.

06:57.217 --> 07:00.488
- Well, they've probably
had enough of you by now.

07:00.521 --> 07:01.889
- A joke, I like it.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.857
- Don't get used to it.

07:03.891 --> 07:04.758
- Never.

07:06.159 --> 07:07.194
Enjoy.

07:11.499 --> 07:12.099
- Hi.

07:12.132 --> 07:15.135
My name is Rachel Moreno.

07:15.168 --> 07:16.837
It is...

07:16.870 --> 07:17.571
2:01 PM.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.609
Central standard.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.777
The date is April 2nd

07:23.811 --> 07:26.847
and we are at an
undisclosed location.

07:26.880 --> 07:30.083
This is the first trial
run of the project,

07:30.117 --> 07:32.620
comprised of several elements.

07:32.653 --> 07:35.055
In our holding area
for the test subjects

07:35.088 --> 07:38.158
we have the basics
for human survival.

07:38.191 --> 07:40.794
There will be meal
drops once daily

07:40.828 --> 07:42.896
and will consist of the
essential food groups

07:42.930 --> 07:45.065
needed to sustain the subjects.

07:45.098 --> 07:46.199
There are no surprises.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.569
It will be the
same meal every day

07:48.602 --> 07:50.904
for the duration of the trials.

07:50.938 --> 07:53.641
The test itself will extend
over a two month period.

07:53.674 --> 07:56.610
The main part, the most
important part of all of this,

07:56.644 --> 07:59.012
is the drug, codenamed Vex.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.983
An untested trial run.

08:03.016 --> 08:06.086
This pill was
manufactured by Gavin Demy

08:06.119 --> 08:08.589
after years of development.

08:08.622 --> 08:11.158
He and I, we created the Vex-555

08:12.560 --> 08:14.928
for the use in these trials.

08:14.962 --> 08:18.298
The drug itself id a
psychotropic psychoactive drug

08:18.331 --> 08:21.201
that within our
theoretical research

08:21.234 --> 08:25.939
will be used to show us a
person's most extreme emotion.

08:25.973 --> 08:27.307
What we hop to prove is that if

08:27.340 --> 08:29.877
we can isolate a
person's tendency

08:29.910 --> 08:32.044
towards certain
emotional triggers,

08:32.078 --> 08:34.081
their most common emotion,

08:34.114 --> 08:36.650
we can filter out
the emotion response

08:36.683 --> 08:39.852
that causes people
to act violently.

08:40.721 --> 08:43.190
This pill theoretically
will separate their emotions

08:43.222 --> 08:45.158
into categories.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.995
Joy, sadness, anger, et cetera.

08:49.930 --> 08:53.333
Each subject chosen for
this project is a variable.

08:53.366 --> 08:56.103
Their individual violent
nature and crimes

08:56.136 --> 08:58.606
are varied for trial purposes.

08:58.639 --> 09:02.209
All lifers with different
backgrounds and circumstances

09:02.242 --> 09:03.877
and each have a story.

09:03.911 --> 09:05.278
They each have a crime.

09:05.312 --> 09:08.716
And they all have an
emotional response.

09:08.749 --> 09:13.086
The violent response
that caused their crimes.

09:14.922 --> 09:15.823
In the future,

09:15.856 --> 09:18.258
we can find these
warning signs early on

09:18.291 --> 09:22.262
and stop these terrible
things from happening

09:23.163 --> 09:24.998
before they happen.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.102
That's the goal of these trials

09:29.136 --> 09:29.837
in theory.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.707
We have a handpicked team by me

09:33.741 --> 09:36.209
who will be assisting
with the trials.

09:38.345 --> 09:39.379
Uh.

09:39.412 --> 09:42.082
My name is Dr. Aaron Graybor.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.217
Recent grad...

09:44.251 --> 09:46.153
Well, that's not true.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.658
Let's try this again.

09:50.691 --> 09:51.625
What do they say in the movies?

09:51.659 --> 09:52.292
Take two?

09:52.325 --> 09:53.160
Something like that.

09:54.662 --> 09:56.964
My name is Dr. Aaron Graybor.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.632
I'm a graduate of Berkeley.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.634
Started at the bureau
a few years ago,

10:00.668 --> 10:03.236
where I met Miss Moreno, Rachel.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.238
Well, that's what I call her.

10:05.973 --> 10:07.174
That's what everybody calls her,

10:07.207 --> 10:09.176
but you know what I mean.

10:09.209 --> 10:10.377
She's great.

10:10.410 --> 10:14.047
Anyway, I'm the lead
pharmaceutical tech.

10:14.081 --> 10:15.382
I administer the Vex-555,

10:15.415 --> 10:18.318
maintain any protocols
that need to be maintained,

10:18.351 --> 10:20.220
monitor the test subjects.

10:20.253 --> 10:22.690
You know, lead tech basically.

10:23.991 --> 10:25.125
Real excited to be a
part of this project.

10:25.158 --> 10:26.727
Real excited.

10:26.760 --> 10:27.728
Hell of a cook too, man.

10:27.761 --> 10:31.699
I can just, you know,
stir fry, whatever man.

10:31.732 --> 10:32.365
Anyway,

10:33.100 --> 10:34.167
I'm just real happy to be here.

10:34.201 --> 10:35.135
Thanks a lot, guys.

10:35.168 --> 10:37.170
We'll be in touch. Thanks.

10:41.809 --> 10:43.243
- I'm Dr. Beverly Gale.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.078
I'm the lead physician
on the project.

10:45.112 --> 10:47.180
I'll be monitoring the
vitals and general health

10:47.214 --> 10:49.249
of the test subjects.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.051
I'm really excited.

10:51.084 --> 10:54.021
This is a very big
opportunity for me.

10:54.054 --> 10:57.057
And, of course, the
rest of the world.

10:57.090 --> 10:58.225
Yeah.

10:58.258 --> 11:00.728
A very big opportunity.

11:00.761 --> 11:01.661
- Maggie Richards.

11:01.695 --> 11:04.097
Junior behavioral
analyst for the bureau.

11:04.131 --> 11:06.033
I graduated from Yale as well

11:06.066 --> 11:09.837
and I am just very honored to
be working under Miss Moreno.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.438
Someone with her passion?

11:11.471 --> 11:13.173
It's inspiring.

11:13.206 --> 11:15.242
I hope to be like that one day.

11:15.275 --> 11:16.143
Like her.

11:17.277 --> 11:19.479
I'll be handling the day-to-day
operations of the trial

11:19.512 --> 11:21.248
and assisting Miss
Moreno in anything

11:21.281 --> 11:23.116
she or the trial may need.

11:23.150 --> 11:24.317
Thank you.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.253
- In addition to the pill,

11:26.286 --> 11:29.256
the test subjects will
undergo 8 hours a day

11:29.289 --> 11:30.257
in complete darkness.

11:30.290 --> 11:33.794
It's our hope that this
will allow them to be

11:33.827 --> 11:35.796
alone with their thoughts

11:35.829 --> 11:40.000
and allow the Vex to
truly organize their

11:40.033 --> 11:42.069
emotions properly.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.271
What else is there?

11:46.273 --> 11:47.140
That's it.

11:48.275 --> 11:51.078
That's it for our
first broadcast.

11:51.111 --> 11:52.179
It's time to begin.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.313
No more talking.

11:54.514 --> 11:55.849
Rachel?

11:55.883 --> 11:56.884
Sorry to bug you.

11:56.917 --> 11:59.252
The test subjects are here.

12:15.335 --> 12:18.471
- Any sudden movements
and you will be shot.

12:18.505 --> 12:21.241
On your feet! Out of the van!

12:57.610 --> 12:59.179
- These are the subjects.

12:59.212 --> 13:00.480
Each has been assigned a letter

13:00.513 --> 13:02.916
for chart and
observational purposes.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.584
You can refer to them by name.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.287
The letter is preferred,
given the circumstances.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.555
- I agree.

13:08.588 --> 13:12.860
Let's really try to keep it to
letter references only, guys.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.294
- Here we go.

13:14.327 --> 13:15.362
Subject G.

13:15.395 --> 13:16.830
Brad Lancaster.

13:16.864 --> 13:17.664
Three live sentences.

13:17.697 --> 13:19.499
Convicted child
murderer and rapist.

13:19.532 --> 13:21.835
He was known as the
"Carnival Killer,"

13:21.869 --> 13:23.203
responsible for
the rape and deaths

13:23.236 --> 13:26.239
of four children under
six a few years back.

13:26.273 --> 13:27.841
Subject I.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.242
Christian Allen Keys.

13:29.276 --> 13:30.243
Life.

13:30.277 --> 13:32.445
Tied up a man to a fence
and burned him alive.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.314
In spite of the
overwhelming evidence,

13:34.347 --> 13:36.249
Christian has maintained
his innocence.

13:36.283 --> 13:37.317
He even pleaded innocent

13:37.350 --> 13:39.186
despite his lawyers
advising him to plead guilty

13:39.219 --> 13:41.354
for a possible reduced sentence.

13:41.388 --> 13:42.622
Subject A.

13:42.655 --> 13:43.523
Evan Wright.

13:43.556 --> 13:44.491
Life.

13:44.524 --> 13:46.326
He murdered a man he
found having an affair

13:46.359 --> 13:47.494
with his then wife.

13:47.527 --> 13:50.597
He beat him to death with
a shovel in the front yard.

13:50.630 --> 13:51.798
Community was completely shocked

13:51.831 --> 13:54.868
due to his involvement with
the church and town council.

13:54.902 --> 13:56.569
He claims to have blacked out.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.305
Has no recollection of it.

13:58.338 --> 14:01.641
Believes he was possessed
by Satan apparently.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.210
Subject C.

14:03.243 --> 14:03.977
Melissa Lee.

14:04.011 --> 14:05.345
22. Life.

14:05.378 --> 14:08.248
For the murder of
her baby brothers.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.417
She drowned them in
the downstairs bathtub.

14:10.450 --> 14:13.186
She was 19 at the time.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.421
She never even apologized.

14:14.454 --> 14:17.324
Showed no remorse, even now.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.191
Subject E.

14:18.225 --> 14:19.192
Nikolai.

14:19.226 --> 14:20.260
That's it.

14:20.293 --> 14:22.295
No last name. Two
life sentences.

14:22.329 --> 14:23.496
Ukrainian descent.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.298
Speaks no English.

14:25.332 --> 14:27.234
In first appearance, as far
as the world is concerned,

14:27.267 --> 14:29.302
was six years ago, when he
turned up in a neighborhood

14:29.336 --> 14:31.304
in Boise and murdered
an entire family

14:31.338 --> 14:33.240
only to make his way to
the next row of houses

14:33.273 --> 14:34.407
and kill anyone home.

14:34.441 --> 14:35.909
No motive, nothing.

14:35.943 --> 14:39.212
He's a high but necessary risk.

14:39.246 --> 14:40.680
So he's gonna be chained up

14:40.713 --> 14:43.583
for the duration
of the experiments.

14:43.616 --> 14:44.918
And here's the odd one out.

14:44.952 --> 14:45.986
Megan Salois.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.487
As you know, Megan
volunteered to be our control

14:47.520 --> 14:48.488
for the trials

14:48.521 --> 14:51.324
to see how it affects
non-violent individuals.

14:51.358 --> 14:54.561
She very bravely has created
a criminal background story

14:54.594 --> 14:57.330
as to fit in and we'll
be monitoring her closely

14:57.364 --> 14:58.932
while she's inside.

14:58.966 --> 15:00.500
- Now that you know a
little bit about their past,

15:00.533 --> 15:03.036
I would like to concentrate
on their future.

15:03.070 --> 15:05.305
There will be no
contact with them.

15:05.338 --> 15:06.606
Outside of Aaron and the guards,

15:06.639 --> 15:08.976
who will be
administering Vex-555,

15:09.009 --> 15:10.944
nobody will be in
contact with them

15:10.978 --> 15:12.445
unless absolutely necessary

15:12.479 --> 15:15.082
and even then, we question it.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.317
You've all bee asked to
turn in your cellphones.

15:17.350 --> 15:21.454
There will be no contact with
anyone outside this building.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.356
There's a hard line
that's been set up

15:23.390 --> 15:24.357
in case of emergencies.

15:24.391 --> 15:26.093
Outside of that,

15:26.526 --> 15:28.195
no contact.

15:28.228 --> 15:29.929
Do I make myself clear?

15:30.563 --> 15:31.398
Yes.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.032
Understood.

15:32.065 --> 15:33.100
- Absolutely. Absolutely.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.667
So let's go ahead and get
a few of those samples

15:34.701 --> 15:36.069
and a couple of the other...

15:43.776 --> 15:45.078
Wait a second. Wait a second.

15:45.112 --> 15:46.379
Rachel, she's
throwing the signal.

15:46.413 --> 15:48.048
- Hold on, she's
just freaking out.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.016
Maybe we should
get her out of there.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.550
- No, just wait.

15:50.583 --> 15:51.985
- No, no wait.

15:52.019 --> 15:53.453
No. No.

15:53.486 --> 15:54.387
Please don't.

15:54.421 --> 15:55.088
- Move it!

15:55.122 --> 15:56.523
- Please don't!

15:56.556 --> 15:57.390
Rachel!

15:57.424 --> 15:58.558
- I said wait!

15:59.759 --> 16:00.994
- Damn it, I'm pulling her out.

16:01.028 --> 16:04.664
- If you pull her we're gonna
have to wait for another one.

16:04.697 --> 16:06.366
- Jason.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.635
Pull subject K now.

16:08.668 --> 16:09.736
- Roger that.

16:12.572 --> 16:13.406
- It's okay.

16:13.440 --> 16:14.541
Megan, it's okay.

16:14.574 --> 16:15.408
It's fine.

16:15.442 --> 16:16.309
Don't worry about it.

16:16.343 --> 16:17.344
Don't worry about it.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.046
You don't have to do it.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.348
- I'm so sorry, Rachel.

16:21.381 --> 16:22.415
I can't.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.022
- It's okay.

16:34.761 --> 16:37.630
We're sending in
somebody to pick her up.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.168
- We don't.

16:41.201 --> 16:42.802
They said to continue
as scheduled.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.738
Adjust the experiment as needed.

16:45.772 --> 16:46.806
Look, it can still work.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.176
We have procedures drawn
up for this very scenario.

16:49.209 --> 16:51.411
I mean, nothing is perfect.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.580
- This was supposed to be.

16:55.082 --> 16:58.085
Call me when you
administer the Vex.

17:44.697 --> 17:45.532
All right.

17:46.866 --> 17:47.834
Uh, okay.

17:47.867 --> 17:49.769
So this is the medication.

17:49.802 --> 17:51.138
Just go ahead.

17:54.707 --> 17:55.575
Check.

17:57.244 --> 17:59.146
Great. Great. Great.

18:03.550 --> 18:04.517
Same drill.

18:08.521 --> 18:10.190
All right with that?

18:10.223 --> 18:11.424
There you go.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.129
That a boy.

18:16.163 --> 18:18.431
Awesome. Great. Thank you.

18:19.499 --> 18:20.200
Okay.

18:27.174 --> 18:28.808
All right. All right.

18:33.613 --> 18:34.481
Yeah.

18:39.286 --> 18:40.153
Okay.

18:45.758 --> 18:46.626
So.

18:52.232 --> 18:53.700
Check.

18:53.733 --> 18:54.601
Thank you.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.171
Okay.

18:58.205 --> 18:58.871
So, right.

19:01.308 --> 19:02.175
Last one.

19:24.231 --> 19:24.864
Check.

19:24.897 --> 19:25.732
Okay.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.667
Thanks. Thanks.

19:27.700 --> 19:28.568
Come on.

19:31.904 --> 19:32.805
Okay.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.907
So the doors behind
me, gonna be sealed,

19:34.941 --> 19:36.276
duration of the trial.

19:36.309 --> 19:38.945
You do have facilities, toilet,

19:40.547 --> 19:42.215
toothbrushes, things like that.

19:42.249 --> 19:44.584
Anyway, you're being
watch 24 hours a day,

19:44.617 --> 19:46.619
so let's just play nice,
let's get through this,

19:46.653 --> 19:48.555
make it easy as possible.

19:48.588 --> 19:49.722
Lights out at 10PM.

19:49.756 --> 19:50.657
Lights up at 6AM.

19:50.690 --> 19:54.227
Meals will be served
just prior to that.

19:55.295 --> 19:56.629
You know,

19:56.663 --> 19:57.797
enjoy your stay.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.234
Anyway.

20:01.268 --> 20:01.934
Okay.

20:11.844 --> 20:13.880
Would you please
follow me to your bunk?

20:13.913 --> 20:16.616
- I can walk there by myself.

20:16.649 --> 20:17.917
- We're instructed
to assist all staff

20:17.950 --> 20:19.786
to their rooms the first night.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.788
After that we stay outside.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.956
- I was told we'd
have full security.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.658
- We're here to assist
with the delivery

20:25.692 --> 20:26.959
in securing the subjects.

20:26.993 --> 20:27.794
We're here to make sure

20:27.827 --> 20:30.597
all staff are secure
the first night.

20:30.630 --> 20:31.664
That's it.

20:31.698 --> 20:36.002
No interference unless
dire circumstances arise.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.837
- Okay then.

20:37.870 --> 20:38.871
Escort away.

21:27.019 --> 21:28.054
- Okay.

21:29.756 --> 21:30.890
Let's do this.

23:23.135 --> 23:23.870
- No.

23:24.971 --> 23:27.406
Somethings I just don't touch.

23:40.787 --> 23:41.488
All right.

23:44.491 --> 23:46.125
- You can come over here.

23:46.158 --> 23:47.026
Join us.

23:49.829 --> 23:51.030
- No thank you.

23:54.901 --> 23:55.768
Manners.

23:57.003 --> 23:58.037
"No thank you."

24:02.041 --> 24:03.843
Very well.

24:03.876 --> 24:06.012
I'm gonna steal your bread.

24:06.045 --> 24:07.213
Mine looks funny.

24:10.517 --> 24:11.584
- Took his bread.

24:11.618 --> 24:12.218
- No.

24:12.251 --> 24:15.054
I mean, to wind up here.

24:15.087 --> 24:16.889
Why were you in prison?

24:16.923 --> 24:18.858
- And you really
care about that?

24:18.891 --> 24:21.260
- I'm interested in
all of God's creations.

24:21.293 --> 24:22.495
- Oh boy,

24:22.529 --> 24:23.930
a religious man.

24:25.197 --> 24:28.234
Hold on to your
pews there, padre.

24:28.267 --> 24:31.137
Ever heard of the
Carnival Killer?

24:34.574 --> 24:35.241
- Yeah.

24:36.676 --> 24:37.910
It was.

24:37.944 --> 24:40.079
- You're a child molester.

24:41.047 --> 24:43.883
- The label they gave me.

24:43.916 --> 24:48.054
- What label would you
give yourself then?

24:48.087 --> 24:48.788
- Spoon.

24:49.956 --> 24:52.124
Butter my bread with a spoon.

24:55.194 --> 24:58.064
I guess I'd label myself human.

24:58.097 --> 24:59.866
Like the rest of you.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.672
You like jazz?

25:05.705 --> 25:07.173
- Um.

25:07.206 --> 25:08.240
No, not really.

25:10.710 --> 25:11.578
- I do.

25:12.612 --> 25:13.613
I really do.

25:16.115 --> 25:19.151
I guess that's what
makes us different.

25:22.622 --> 25:23.289
Now,

25:25.124 --> 25:28.127
that's why I'm
here in this spot.

25:29.128 --> 25:30.129
Same as you.

25:33.633 --> 25:36.168
I wasn't very popular in prison.

25:37.203 --> 25:40.640
For reasons beyond my reasoning.

25:40.673 --> 25:41.941
So yeah,

25:41.974 --> 25:44.043
private prison facility?

25:44.076 --> 25:46.312
In trade for whatever this is.

25:49.248 --> 25:50.116
Yeah.

25:51.250 --> 25:52.184
Felt right.

25:54.353 --> 25:55.221
Felt good.

26:06.766 --> 26:07.700
- Hey, hey.

26:10.302 --> 26:13.005
So what're they doing?

26:13.039 --> 26:13.906
- Talking.

26:20.079 --> 26:21.213
- A few hours.

26:22.314 --> 26:24.116
Can you take notes?

26:25.017 --> 26:26.118
They're talking.

26:26.152 --> 26:27.620
There's no reaction yet.

26:27.654 --> 26:29.956
- Then take notes on that.

26:31.323 --> 26:32.625
I'll be back.

26:40.366 --> 26:42.001
You're the lady.

26:47.006 --> 26:47.707
All right.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.221
- Fuck off.

27:06.225 --> 27:08.094
Fucked off. Came back.

27:09.762 --> 27:10.629
Seriously.

27:11.430 --> 27:12.398
What'd you do?

27:14.466 --> 27:18.337
She doesn't
have to share it with us.

27:19.839 --> 27:21.373
- By all means, friend.

27:21.407 --> 27:23.810
Share your origin.

27:23.843 --> 27:25.411
You're so worried about mine.

27:25.444 --> 27:27.747
- I'm not interested
in sharing mine either.

27:27.780 --> 27:28.647
Thank you.

27:32.719 --> 27:34.687
- Don't think I don't
know who you are.

27:34.721 --> 27:35.387
Torch.

27:38.024 --> 27:39.358
I know who you are.

27:42.194 --> 27:43.730
I killed
my wife's lover.

27:44.663 --> 27:48.000
I did and
I'm not proud of it.

27:49.268 --> 27:51.804
- Act of protection in my book.

27:51.838 --> 27:52.739
Definitely.

27:54.273 --> 27:56.208
He's fucking your wife.

27:58.144 --> 28:00.412
- Don't refer to it as that.

28:01.380 --> 28:02.248
- Okay.

28:04.450 --> 28:07.019
So he's plugging your wife.

28:07.887 --> 28:09.388
You what

28:09.421 --> 28:10.456
You find him?

28:12.258 --> 28:14.260
- I had trouble with it.

28:17.296 --> 28:18.765
- Whatever, guy.

28:19.766 --> 28:21.801
The mic's passed back to you.

28:21.834 --> 28:25.137
- Fuck off and die,
you piece of shit.

28:28.440 --> 28:29.275
- Hey.

28:30.910 --> 28:32.444
Have that file on C?

28:42.088 --> 28:43.322
- A few days in.

28:43.355 --> 28:44.223
It's slow.

28:45.324 --> 28:46.325
As expected.

28:47.559 --> 28:50.129
No reactions or
side effects yet.

28:50.162 --> 28:52.164
They aren't interacting much.

28:52.198 --> 28:55.201
Subject A and G,
being the most vocal.

28:59.238 --> 29:01.841
Morale amongst
the staff is good.

29:01.874 --> 29:03.810
I can tell they're anxious.

29:03.843 --> 29:04.844
Maybe bored.

29:05.812 --> 29:08.114
I've been busy. Very busy.

29:10.482 --> 29:12.852
That's all for now.

29:43.315 --> 29:44.383
Anything yet?

29:45.384 --> 29:46.886
- Nothing at all.

29:50.957 --> 29:52.424
- This one.

29:52.458 --> 29:53.960
Never interacts with anybody.

29:53.993 --> 29:54.961
Ever.

29:54.994 --> 29:57.864
- I'm just glad he's not
tearing anyone apart.

29:57.897 --> 29:59.165
- Well that's what
the fail safe's for

29:59.198 --> 30:01.233
if we need a fail safe,

30:01.267 --> 30:03.135
but it's been fine so far.

30:03.169 --> 30:04.236
It's been great, actually.

30:04.270 --> 30:06.338
A little boring but productive.

30:06.372 --> 30:07.239
- So far.

30:14.981 --> 30:16.248
- He'd be proud.

30:24.256 --> 30:25.291
- Sure.

30:32.899 --> 30:35.434
You know
what he did, right?

30:35.467 --> 30:37.369
- No, I don't.

30:37.403 --> 30:39.238
- Burned a man.

30:39.271 --> 30:42.308
Tied him to a fence and "phew."

30:42.341 --> 30:43.275
Burned him.

30:45.211 --> 30:47.646
Pretty ruthless shit, huh?

30:47.679 --> 30:48.380
Then,

30:49.515 --> 30:51.984
boy barks that he didn't do it.

30:52.018 --> 30:53.485
Can you believe that?

30:53.519 --> 30:55.888
- I'm sure he has his reasons.

30:55.922 --> 30:58.390
- Yeah, he probably didn't want
to go to jail, motherfucker.

30:58.424 --> 30:59.591
Shit.

30:59.625 --> 31:03.229
- I think we just need to
keep quiet about his business.

31:03.262 --> 31:03.762
Okay?

31:10.937 --> 31:11.603
- No.

31:13.039 --> 31:14.640
- You're Jesus Christ.

31:17.309 --> 31:18.577
Why are you asking?

31:18.610 --> 31:20.312
- I am bored.

31:20.346 --> 31:22.248
I need to talk.

31:22.281 --> 31:25.985
- I'm just a believer
with a particular faith.

31:27.286 --> 31:28.520
- Cool.

31:30.256 --> 31:31.323
- No.

31:31.357 --> 31:32.524
- Oh well,

31:32.558 --> 31:35.494
that's not a bad
thing necessarily.

31:36.728 --> 31:37.596
Spiritual?

31:38.597 --> 31:41.067
- Had my palm read once.

31:41.100 --> 31:44.070
I thought the whole
thing was fucking stupid.

31:44.103 --> 31:48.574
My niece used to tell me
about her horoscope stuff

31:48.607 --> 31:50.442
before I wasn't
allowed to see her

31:50.476 --> 31:52.378
or be near her anymore.

31:53.312 --> 31:54.580
But no, fuck no.

31:56.115 --> 31:58.284
I'm not of a God type.

31:59.285 --> 32:00.086
- Again,

32:00.119 --> 32:01.253
that's fair.

32:04.690 --> 32:06.325
- Even if I was,

32:07.293 --> 32:08.660
only one God now.

32:09.695 --> 32:10.662
Who's that?

32:15.667 --> 32:17.269
- Always watching.

32:19.305 --> 32:21.007
Keeping us in line.

32:39.691 --> 32:41.693
- Everything looks good.

32:43.562 --> 32:45.064
Good night, Rach.

33:25.504 --> 33:27.139
So they
were whispering?

33:27.173 --> 33:29.675
- It was like sleep talking.

33:29.708 --> 33:31.543
- Yeah, I used to
do that all the time

33:31.577 --> 33:33.412
when I was writing
thesis papers, actually.

33:33.445 --> 33:35.114
- No, they were all doing it.

33:35.147 --> 33:37.449
I mean, it was
like a side effect

33:37.483 --> 33:39.017
or maybe a stage.

33:40.586 --> 33:42.088
It wasn't paranoia.

33:43.122 --> 33:45.524
It was like a mix of emotions.

33:49.161 --> 33:53.132
- Well maybe things are
starting to pick up, you know?

34:28.634 --> 34:29.501
- Sure.

34:40.246 --> 34:42.681
- You just stay to yourself.

34:43.649 --> 34:47.518
- I'm not trying to
make any friends.

34:47.553 --> 34:50.188
- I hear you believe
you're innocent.

34:50.222 --> 34:51.489
- I am innocent.

34:52.690 --> 34:55.694
So you believe you
don't belong in the trials.

34:55.726 --> 34:58.564
- I didn't belong in prison.

34:58.597 --> 35:01.433
If I never went there
I wouldn't be here.

35:05.171 --> 35:06.538
- Please.

35:06.572 --> 35:07.773
Leave me alone.

36:21.280 --> 36:21.913
What's going on?

36:21.947 --> 36:24.216
I got the alert.

36:26.885 --> 36:28.920
How long have they been
standing like that?

36:28.954 --> 36:30.889
- I came in, flicked
on the lights

36:30.922 --> 36:32.624
and they were just like this.

36:32.658 --> 36:33.725
20, 25 minutes.

36:33.759 --> 36:34.893
How're their vitals?

36:34.926 --> 36:36.662
- Everything's fine.

37:17.303 --> 37:21.407
It's like they've been
reduced to basic functions.

37:28.380 --> 37:31.049
Why isn't
Nikolai responding the same?

37:31.082 --> 37:36.054
- I don't, Rachel, maybe he's
further along than the rest.

37:36.087 --> 37:40.258
- Two weeks in and I think
we have our first results.

37:41.460 --> 37:43.629
The subjects seem to
be going in and out

37:43.662 --> 37:45.997
of almost a walking coma.

37:46.031 --> 37:50.035
Basic motor functions
and physiological

37:50.068 --> 37:53.939
All of their cognitive
functions seem to be absent.

37:53.972 --> 37:57.609
If what I think is happening
is actually happening,

37:57.643 --> 38:01.447
this maybe the phase where
emotions are being categorized.

38:01.480 --> 38:02.948
Hopefully.

38:02.981 --> 38:05.917
Subject E is having
an adverse reaction.

38:05.951 --> 38:07.919
Perhaps to Vex-555.

38:07.953 --> 38:09.855
He's shrieking

38:09.888 --> 38:11.990
a very high-pitched wail.

38:12.991 --> 38:14.860
We believe he is hallucinating

38:14.893 --> 38:16.795
or maybe he's at another level,

38:16.828 --> 38:19.331
as Dr. Graybor
pointed out to me.

38:19.365 --> 38:20.699
Despite the uncertainty,

38:20.732 --> 38:22.868
we are very, very excited

38:22.901 --> 38:26.104
at the prospects that
something is happening.

38:26.137 --> 38:29.908
The rest of the subjects
just emotionless.

38:44.690 --> 38:46.091
Have you guys
looked at these charts?

38:46.124 --> 38:47.926
The sleep patterns are way up.

38:48.827 --> 38:49.695
- Yeah.

38:51.863 --> 38:54.866
- It happens twice
to both of them?

38:54.900 --> 38:56.968
- Yeah, brain
activity spikes twice

38:57.002 --> 38:58.837
over the course of the
night and then goes dormant,

38:58.870 --> 38:59.905
except for subject E.

38:59.938 --> 39:01.807
He's been having a much
faster response to the Vex

39:01.840 --> 39:03.942
and I don't know why yet.

39:11.917 --> 39:13.051
This is Dr. Graybor.

39:13.084 --> 39:15.020
No, you're talking
to Dr. Graybor.

39:15.053 --> 39:17.355
Yes, Aaron, what's going on?

39:18.156 --> 39:19.057
Wait, wait, slow down,

39:19.090 --> 39:20.926
what's going on?

39:25.731 --> 39:26.698
Two knocks and my name.

39:26.732 --> 39:29.034
Yeah, yeah, I'm coming!

39:29.067 --> 39:29.935
- Aaron!

39:33.071 --> 39:34.473
Aaron, talk to me.

39:34.506 --> 39:35.140
- Rachel.

39:36.041 --> 39:37.709
- It's nothing.

39:38.444 --> 39:39.077
Open up!

39:39.110 --> 39:39.945
- Talk to me.

39:39.978 --> 39:40.946
- Rachel, enough!

39:40.979 --> 39:42.748
Open the door now!

39:56.795 --> 39:57.295
Aaron?

39:59.465 --> 40:00.265
What the hell is that?

40:00.298 --> 40:01.967
You can't just pull
them like that.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.435
- Not my place to explain.

40:06.004 --> 40:08.740
- Please step back, Miss Moreno.

40:14.112 --> 40:16.114
What did he say to you?

40:16.147 --> 40:17.015
Hey!

40:22.020 --> 40:23.989
- My mom was in some
kind of accident.

40:24.022 --> 40:26.458
I don't know, she's in
the hospital, Rachel.

40:26.492 --> 40:27.225
I'm done, okay?

40:27.258 --> 40:28.994
I'm leaving.

40:29.027 --> 40:29.828
- You can't leave.

40:29.861 --> 40:32.998
You know they won't
let you leave.

40:33.031 --> 40:34.800
- It's an emergency.

40:34.833 --> 40:36.134
- You're lucky they
let you talk to her.

40:36.167 --> 40:38.036
- I didn't talk to her.

40:38.069 --> 40:41.607
I spoke to some agent
who spoke to a local PD.

40:41.640 --> 40:44.543
She doesn't even
know that I know.

40:44.576 --> 40:45.577
- You can't.

40:46.845 --> 40:48.480
You can't leave.

40:48.514 --> 40:49.180
Not now.

40:51.149 --> 40:53.785
I'm sorry about your mother.

40:55.020 --> 40:56.855
Unpack your bags.

40:56.888 --> 40:59.190
Take all the time that you need.

40:59.224 --> 41:01.092
But you can not leave!

41:08.066 --> 41:10.001
Nothing good to report.

41:12.103 --> 41:13.004
Nothing good.

42:17.135 --> 42:18.003
Aaron!

42:19.270 --> 42:20.138
Hello!

42:22.040 --> 42:23.041
Aaron!

42:23.074 --> 42:24.309
- I got it.

42:24.342 --> 42:26.111
Subject E is having a reaction

42:26.144 --> 42:27.012
much faster than
the rest of them

42:27.045 --> 42:29.981
because his level of
crime warrants it.

42:30.015 --> 42:32.150
I wrote it down. I got it.

42:35.186 --> 42:37.222
- Yeah, I agree, Rachel.

42:37.255 --> 42:39.424
That's why I wrote it down.

42:43.294 --> 42:44.262
- Week three.

42:44.295 --> 42:45.230
Week three.

42:46.297 --> 42:50.001
The subjects are complaining
of skin irritation,

42:50.035 --> 42:53.138
though nothing visible is seen.

42:53.171 --> 42:55.340
It could be another
hallucinogenic reaction,

42:55.373 --> 42:58.009
but either way, we're
making progress.

42:58.043 --> 43:00.145
We're making great progress.

43:01.780 --> 43:05.016
I believe these are stages
instead of side effects.

43:05.050 --> 43:06.752
I do believe

43:06.785 --> 43:09.120
that this could be the
mind truly separating

43:09.154 --> 43:12.223
and categorizing each emotion.

43:12.257 --> 43:17.162
Each stage representing the
separation of mind and body.

43:17.195 --> 43:19.164
The scratching, the screaming,

43:19.197 --> 43:21.332
the almost catatonic stage.

43:21.366 --> 43:24.636
It's doing its job
one step at a time.

44:15.787 --> 44:18.023
- I suppose it's working.

44:19.190 --> 44:20.058
- Sure.

44:23.128 --> 44:24.395
Is the itching bad?

44:25.363 --> 44:26.264
- I'm fine.

44:28.399 --> 44:30.702
You don't look much worse.

44:30.736 --> 44:32.103
- You're lucky.

44:34.339 --> 44:37.175
I just want you to know

44:37.208 --> 44:38.710
that I believe you

44:38.744 --> 44:41.212
when you say you're innocent.

44:44.182 --> 44:45.851
- Ah.

44:45.884 --> 44:47.018
I was curious

44:47.052 --> 44:51.256
if I was out walking down
the street when you saw me,

44:54.525 --> 44:57.195
would you think that I could be

44:58.363 --> 44:59.230
what I am?

45:01.532 --> 45:03.034
- You did what you did.

45:03.068 --> 45:04.836
You're here.

45:04.870 --> 45:06.437
So that's all I know.

45:13.779 --> 45:15.046
- End of month

45:15.080 --> 45:17.883
and we've had fantastic
results so far.

45:17.916 --> 45:20.752
We're still waiting on the
reveal of what're now calling

45:20.786 --> 45:22.187
the final emotion.

45:22.220 --> 45:25.523
Which will represent the
culmination of these trials.

45:25.556 --> 45:28.393
When we boil it
down as a side note,

45:28.426 --> 45:31.296
an interesting note
about subject I.

45:31.329 --> 45:34.132
He seems to maintain
an innocence.

45:34.165 --> 45:35.901
He's displaying
less dramatic scopes

45:35.934 --> 45:37.903
of the stages so far,

45:37.936 --> 45:41.106
so I plan to keep
special tabs on him.

46:47.538 --> 46:48.606
- Hey.

46:48.639 --> 46:49.975
Hi,
sorry to bother you.

46:51.176 --> 46:52.210
- They're here.

46:52.944 --> 46:54.279
- They.

46:55.446 --> 46:58.516
- Yeah, they're outside Jason
will take you out there.

46:58.549 --> 47:00.151
- Okay, thank you.

47:05.290 --> 47:06.457
Hello, Miss Moreno.

47:06.491 --> 47:07.492
- Hello.

47:07.525 --> 47:08.894
How are you?

47:08.927 --> 47:09.861
- Good.

47:12.330 --> 47:13.865
Are you not
getting my reports?

47:13.899 --> 47:15.000
- We are.

47:15.033 --> 47:17.502
We just
wanted to check in personally.

47:17.535 --> 47:20.271
Alert you to some changes.

47:21.439 --> 47:23.341
Ah, okay, what changes exactly?

47:23.374 --> 47:24.876
- We'll be asking
Jason and his team

47:24.910 --> 47:27.278
to now be allowed inside
for security purposes.

47:27.312 --> 47:28.880
They don't need to be.

47:28.914 --> 47:29.948
Everything is fine.

47:29.981 --> 47:32.017
- Due to some of the
reports you've been sending,

47:32.050 --> 47:33.584
our assessments have
concluded that the subjects

47:33.618 --> 47:35.586
are becoming more
volatile and unstable.

47:35.620 --> 47:37.488
- They are not volatile.

47:37.522 --> 47:38.990
They're not...

47:39.024 --> 47:41.292
This is just a stage, sir.

47:41.326 --> 47:42.994
No one's been hurt.

47:43.028 --> 47:44.229
- We know that,

47:44.262 --> 47:45.997
but if you want to continue

47:46.031 --> 47:47.298
Jason and his team will be there

47:47.332 --> 47:49.600
to monitor the project
from the inside.

47:49.634 --> 47:51.036
Will not be a bother.

47:51.069 --> 47:53.004
Just supervising
any possible threat.

47:53.038 --> 47:55.040
They won't see any data.

47:55.073 --> 47:57.642
- This isn't a
request, Miss Moreno.

47:57.675 --> 47:59.444
It's what will happen.

47:59.477 --> 48:00.411
Understood?

48:02.280 --> 48:02.981
- Yes.

48:20.331 --> 48:23.334
- It feels like we
have babysitters.

48:29.540 --> 48:31.376
Can we speak about Aaron?

48:33.011 --> 48:37.082
- I don't know, doesn't
he seem distant to you?

48:37.115 --> 48:38.483
- No.

48:38.516 --> 48:39.150
I don't know, why?

48:39.184 --> 48:40.518
Did he say something to you?

48:40.551 --> 48:43.989
- No, it just I had
to redo his charts.

48:45.056 --> 48:47.092
I know telling isn't
very professional,

48:47.125 --> 48:48.626
but I just wanted you to know.

48:48.659 --> 48:51.096
- No, thank you for telling me.

48:51.129 --> 48:53.564
It's not tattling if it's
gonna benefit the project.

48:53.598 --> 48:55.033
I'm gonna talk to him.

48:55.066 --> 48:56.434
- Okay, thanks.

48:59.670 --> 49:01.973
Maybe, I was thinking,

49:02.007 --> 49:02.940
if you wanted me to,

49:02.974 --> 49:04.509
I could take the reins
on some of his work,

49:04.542 --> 49:06.111
that way you and I can
work closer together

49:06.144 --> 49:08.513
and he can have a
smaller workload.

49:08.546 --> 49:12.483
There's probably a lot
on his mind, I'm sure.

49:12.517 --> 49:13.518
- We'll see.

49:16.387 --> 49:17.989
Have you seen Dr. Graybor?

49:18.023 --> 49:19.024
- Nope.

49:19.057 --> 49:22.027
- He's supposed to
be doing rounds.

49:23.128 --> 49:24.529
- I don't see him.

49:28.366 --> 49:29.067
- Nope.

49:32.037 --> 49:33.704
What were you before here?

49:33.738 --> 49:35.040
Before this job.

49:36.107 --> 49:38.043
- I can't talk about that.

49:38.076 --> 49:42.013
Even if I wanted
to, I wouldn't know.

49:42.047 --> 49:43.414
I told you,

49:43.448 --> 49:46.017
we are paid to guard.

49:46.051 --> 49:50.021
- You've never been curious
about the places you've guarded?

49:51.056 --> 49:52.423
- I'm not paid to be.

49:52.457 --> 49:54.025
- Good.

49:54.059 --> 49:56.394
I like your dedication.

49:56.427 --> 49:58.429
I hope that on your next job

49:58.463 --> 50:02.600
you will be just as professional
as you've been here.

50:03.668 --> 50:06.037
I put a lot into this.

50:06.071 --> 50:10.375
Variables are variables and
now you've become one of them.

50:11.376 --> 50:13.044
For what it's worth,

50:13.078 --> 50:15.046
and I mean this with respect,

50:15.080 --> 50:17.582
you should be back outside.

50:17.615 --> 50:19.084
We don't need you.

50:23.088 --> 50:24.089
- No.

50:49.114 --> 50:50.615
- Mr. Graybor.

50:50.648 --> 50:52.417
What're you doing?

50:52.450 --> 50:53.551
- Um.

50:54.819 --> 50:56.154
I was exercising.

50:56.187 --> 50:57.488
I do aerobics.

50:58.823 --> 51:00.158
- The hall should be kept clear

51:00.191 --> 51:02.093
if you're not on active hours.

51:02.127 --> 51:02.793
- Right, I understand that.

51:02.827 --> 51:03.728
I just was gonna--

51:03.761 --> 51:07.532
- Please return to
your bunk, Mr. Graybor.

51:08.666 --> 51:09.534
- Okay.

51:52.177 --> 51:55.813
- Jason said he found
you doing aerobics.

51:55.846 --> 51:58.149
- And why would
he tell you that?

51:58.183 --> 51:59.750
- He has to report it to me.

51:59.784 --> 52:00.885
It's my project.

52:02.653 --> 52:03.588
- Yeah.

52:03.621 --> 52:05.156
That's fantastic.

52:05.190 --> 52:05.856
That's great.

52:13.298 --> 52:16.634
- They seem to be in a
permanent state of delirium.

52:16.667 --> 52:18.569
No spacial awareness.

52:18.603 --> 52:20.805
No clear motivation
for their actions.

52:20.838 --> 52:22.507
Wouldn't you agree?

52:28.213 --> 52:29.847
- Whatever, Rachel.

53:54.399 --> 53:55.333
- Week six.

53:57.368 --> 53:59.304
Subjects are catatonic.

54:02.740 --> 54:03.741
Basic needs.

54:04.975 --> 54:06.977
This room feels smaller,

54:08.979 --> 54:10.781
tighter, every day.

54:16.421 --> 54:18.956
Results are still positive.

54:18.989 --> 54:20.825
Affects are being displayed,

54:20.858 --> 54:21.926
so that's good.

54:23.728 --> 54:24.729
That's good.

54:28.966 --> 54:31.869
I believe they'll
remain in this condition

54:31.902 --> 54:35.906
until the final emotion is
ready to present itself.

54:35.940 --> 54:38.976
But for now it's
just basic needs.

55:05.903 --> 55:07.738
Hey.

55:07.772 --> 55:09.840
You should come in.

55:09.874 --> 55:11.676
- No, I shouldn't.

55:11.709 --> 55:13.711
- I'm not really asking.

59:24.294 --> 59:27.197
- Okay, I'm clocking out.

59:27.231 --> 59:29.299
Keep an eye on subject E.

59:30.167 --> 59:33.137
He's had a lot of
movement today.

59:35.339 --> 59:36.206
- Yep.

59:37.642 --> 59:40.144
- And take notes, please.

59:40.177 --> 59:41.178
- I'm aware.

01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:05.970
Hey.

01:00:07.672 --> 01:00:09.406
Shit, I think he's bleeding.

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:11.041
What is he doing?

01:00:11.075 --> 01:00:12.376
- He's got a slightly
elevated heart rate,

01:00:12.409 --> 01:00:14.311
but it's nothing alarming.

01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:16.180
- No, we gotta go in
there and check on him.

01:00:16.213 --> 01:00:17.081
- No, we don't go in there

01:00:17.114 --> 01:00:19.049
unless dire
circumstances warrant it.

01:00:19.083 --> 01:00:20.350
- Beverly, the guy
is puking blood.

01:00:20.384 --> 01:00:22.119
- We don't go in there
until it's necessary.

01:00:24.021 --> 01:00:26.957
Get out of the
way! I'm going in!

01:00:28.292 --> 01:00:29.159
Open it.

01:00:31.028 --> 01:00:32.329
- You know I've
got authorization.

01:00:32.362 --> 01:00:35.065
We need to get in there.

01:00:35.099 --> 01:00:36.033
Move! Let's go!

01:00:36.066 --> 01:00:37.735
Open it up!

01:01:08.866 --> 01:01:11.068
Can you hear what he's saying?

01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:22.379
Shoot him!

01:02:07.257 --> 01:02:09.293
I could
take over his duties.

01:02:09.326 --> 01:02:10.761
- It's fine.

01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:13.163
That's a lot to take on.

01:02:13.197 --> 01:02:14.298
- No, it's fine.

01:02:14.331 --> 01:02:15.800
Please, no questions.

01:02:15.833 --> 01:02:16.500
- Fine.

01:02:18.235 --> 01:02:19.870
I just want to
thank you for the--

01:02:19.904 --> 01:02:20.871
- Go.

01:02:20.905 --> 01:02:21.839
- Okay,

01:02:21.872 --> 01:02:23.073
Of course.

01:02:30.214 --> 01:02:32.282
- So I want to apologize.

01:02:35.185 --> 01:02:37.922
- I was just trying to
protect Dr. Graybor.

01:02:37.955 --> 01:02:39.756
- No, not about that.

01:02:41.291 --> 01:02:44.761
I acted inappropriately
the other night.

01:02:46.363 --> 01:02:47.231
- Oh.

01:02:48.899 --> 01:02:49.766
Okay.

01:02:50.567 --> 01:02:51.435
- Okay.

01:02:52.502 --> 01:02:54.438
I'm glad we understand.

01:02:55.572 --> 01:02:58.876
So I've got some new protocols.

01:02:58.909 --> 01:03:01.445
Nobody goes in there without me.

01:03:03.347 --> 01:03:06.316
No other level of
clearance is allowed.

01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:07.952
Are we clear?

01:03:07.985 --> 01:03:09.153
- Very.

01:03:09.186 --> 01:03:09.887
- Good.

01:05:01.565 --> 01:05:03.968
- We are approaching week eight.

01:05:04.001 --> 01:05:05.469
Do or die.

01:05:05.502 --> 01:05:09.239
I'm working extended hours
in Dr. Graybor's absence.

01:05:09.273 --> 01:05:11.942
Though his actions
were beyond protocol,

01:05:11.976 --> 01:05:13.543
I needed his help.

01:05:14.511 --> 01:05:18.482
The subjects are not responding
at all at this point.

01:05:18.515 --> 01:05:20.951
Barely even eating.

01:05:20.985 --> 01:05:22.652
If they continue this,

01:05:22.686 --> 01:05:24.721
we will have to
cease all trials.

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:27.691
They need to display,
even a little bit,

01:05:27.724 --> 01:05:29.493
that they are still there.

01:05:29.526 --> 01:05:31.395
I need something soon.

01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:17.367
- No!

01:07:17.401 --> 01:07:19.803
No, it' mine you piece of shit!

01:07:19.836 --> 01:07:21.805
You piece of shit! You fuck up!

01:07:21.838 --> 01:07:23.507
No, it's mine!

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:26.710
Is she talking
to another subject?

01:07:26.743 --> 01:07:27.611
- No.

01:07:27.644 --> 01:07:29.746
They're all out cold.

01:07:29.779 --> 01:07:31.715
This is something else.

01:07:31.748 --> 01:07:33.683
- I just wanna get out.

01:07:33.717 --> 01:07:35.119
- She's reconciled.

01:07:35.152 --> 01:07:37.387
She's showing the
emotions that pushed her

01:07:37.421 --> 01:07:39.423
to murder her baby sister.

01:07:39.456 --> 01:07:40.657
Envy, jealousy.

01:07:41.791 --> 01:07:42.759
This is it!

01:07:42.792 --> 01:07:43.860
This is it!

01:07:43.893 --> 01:07:45.095
This is good!

01:07:45.129 --> 01:07:45.829
This is good!

01:07:47.531 --> 01:07:49.499
No, she's mine!

01:07:49.533 --> 01:07:52.402
- We have our
first breakthrough.

01:07:52.436 --> 01:07:55.105
So I'm requesting another week.

01:07:55.139 --> 01:07:56.773
An extension

01:07:56.806 --> 01:07:58.775
through this video.

01:07:58.808 --> 01:08:01.778
We have had our first
subject response

01:08:01.811 --> 01:08:02.746
that we're looking for.

01:08:02.779 --> 01:08:06.583
Subject C is showing
very promising results.

01:08:07.817 --> 01:08:11.521
Cheers!
Cheers!

01:08:11.555 --> 01:08:12.789
- Congratulations to us.

01:08:12.822 --> 01:08:14.124
- Mhmm.

01:08:14.158 --> 01:08:15.759
- Feels good.

01:08:15.792 --> 01:08:16.826
- Feels amazing.

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:19.496
Feels great
to be getting out of here,

01:08:19.529 --> 01:08:20.197
to be honest.

01:08:21.698 --> 01:08:22.866
Too bad Aaron
couldn't be here, huh?

01:08:22.899 --> 01:08:24.533
I hope
he gets better soon

01:08:24.568 --> 01:08:26.603
because that was a little crazy.

01:08:26.636 --> 01:08:28.205
We should take
a trip to the hospital.

01:08:28.238 --> 01:08:29.473
We should.
Right?

01:08:29.506 --> 01:08:30.174
Yeah.

01:08:30.207 --> 01:08:30.874
We're leaving here,

01:08:30.907 --> 01:08:32.276
what, the day after tomorrow?

01:08:32.309 --> 01:08:34.178
I think so.

01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:38.782
- Get the van ready to go.

01:08:38.814 --> 01:08:40.116
- Yes, sir.

01:08:51.828 --> 01:08:53.263
Rachel!

01:09:19.555 --> 01:09:20.657
- We need to pull the fail safe.

01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:21.558
- No! Don't!

01:09:21.591 --> 01:09:22.259
Just wait a minute.

01:09:22.292 --> 01:09:23.193
- Rachel.

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:33.636
If you touch that you will no
longer have a future with me

01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:35.538
in any capacity!

01:09:35.572 --> 01:09:36.906
Do you hear me?

01:09:49.319 --> 01:09:50.754
Rachel, we
need to stop this now!

01:09:50.787 --> 01:09:53.557
- They need to pay
for what they've done!

01:09:57.594 --> 01:09:58.595
- I'm sorry.

01:11:15.071 --> 01:11:19.676
Yes, there's been an incident
and we need to abort.

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:24.748
They're gone.

01:11:31.888 --> 01:11:33.723
Okay, they're on the way.

01:11:33.757 --> 01:11:34.624
He's gonna stay put.

01:11:34.658 --> 01:11:36.326
- I don't know if
that's a good idea.

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:36.993
I think--

01:12:46.430 --> 01:12:47.096
Please.

01:12:47.130 --> 01:12:47.897
- Don't come near me.

01:12:47.931 --> 01:12:48.865
Let
me out of here.

01:12:48.898 --> 01:12:50.500
- Don't move!

01:12:50.534 --> 01:12:51.968
- I didn't do it!

01:12:52.001 --> 01:12:53.837
I didn't kill anyone!

01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:55.972
- Back up! I'm
telling you, back up!

01:12:56.005 --> 01:12:57.040
Why
won't you believe me?

01:12:57.073 --> 01:12:57.907
- Back up!

01:12:57.941 --> 01:12:58.942
- I'm innocent!

01:12:58.975 --> 01:13:00.410
I'm fucking innocent!

01:15:11.007 --> 01:15:13.977
Please
roll the cameras.

01:15:17.981 --> 01:15:19.148
We are
here approximately 12 days

01:15:19.182 --> 01:15:24.220
after the incident that occurred
during Vex-555 trial run.

01:15:24.253 --> 01:15:28.592
Is there
anything you would like to add?

01:15:29.258 --> 01:15:32.929
We have very high hopes
for this Miss Moreno.

01:15:32.962 --> 01:15:35.599
Very high hopes.

01:15:35.632 --> 01:15:39.903
You
understand what happens now?

01:15:39.936 --> 01:15:41.971
Shortly
before the incident occurred,

01:15:42.005 --> 01:15:44.908
you believed you
were on to something.

01:15:44.941 --> 01:15:47.143
Do you still feel that way?
