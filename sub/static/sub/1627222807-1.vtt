00:51.415 --> 00:54.779
-

01:02.525 --> 01:03.590
Ree?

01:05.132 --> 01:06.494
Ree?

01:07.596 --> 01:08.760
Wake up, baby.

01:14.537 --> 01:16.273
They wanna hear you sing.

01:19.146 --> 01:19.771
You wanna sing?

01:20.708 --> 01:21.641
Yes, please.

01:22.545 --> 01:23.742
All right.

01:35.459 --> 01:37.756
Clarence,
Ella's looking for you.

01:38.693 --> 01:40.165
Wait here, Ree.

01:40.200 --> 01:42.299
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

01:42.334 --> 01:43.465
They butchered
my essay.

01:43.500 --> 01:44.433
Took all the politics out.

01:44.468 --> 01:45.797
Can you believe that?

01:45.832 --> 01:48.272
Communism is absolutely
for the Negro.

01:48.307 --> 01:49.834
How else are we gonna have
everything we ever wanted?

01:49.869 --> 01:51.143
Now, how does
a man with one eye

01:51.178 --> 01:52.144
play like he has four hands?

01:53.312 --> 01:54.608
You been practicing?

01:54.643 --> 01:56.247
Yes, Mr. Tatum.

01:56.282 --> 01:57.809
She could hit
three octaves easy.

01:57.844 --> 02:00.680
You know, you the finest
looking cat here, right?

02:00.715 --> 02:02.550
Nigga, I know that.

02:02.585 --> 02:03.815
What else you got?

02:08.261 --> 02:09.821
Hey, Ree.

02:09.856 --> 02:11.328
Hey, Uncle Sam.

02:11.363 --> 02:13.363
No more segregated
clubs for me.

02:13.398 --> 02:14.826
I'm not walking through
no one's kitchen

02:14.861 --> 02:16.861
to get to the stage.

02:16.896 --> 02:20.337
I said to them,
"I'm so happy to be
performing in England,

02:20.372 --> 02:21.569
but just remember

02:21.604 --> 02:23.241
there's only one Heaven,
one Earth,

02:23.276 --> 02:24.836
and one queen.

02:24.871 --> 02:26.904
Me. Dinah Washington."

02:28.743 --> 02:30.710
"That Elizabeth on y'alls
throne is an imposter."

02:30.745 --> 02:32.745
-You didn't.
-Oh, yes, I did.

02:32.780 --> 02:35.352
-And I made 'em bow before me.
-

02:35.387 --> 02:37.420
Well, look out, y'all.

02:38.225 --> 02:39.686
The entertainer is here.

02:40.227 --> 02:41.622
Hi.

02:41.657 --> 02:43.360
He said he wanted
a race novel.

02:43.395 --> 02:45.791
Sure, he desegregated
the army.

02:45.826 --> 02:47.298
But he didn't do
a damn thing after that.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.861
-Hi, Aunt Ella. Uncle Duke.
-Hey.

02:49.896 --> 02:51.599
You ready, Ree?
Come on.

02:57.772 --> 03:00.377
Everyone.

03:00.412 --> 03:02.643
Everyone.

03:02.678 --> 03:05.877
For those of you visiting
my home for the first time,

03:06.814 --> 03:10.552
this is my daughter, Aretha.

03:10.587 --> 03:13.291
She'd like to sing
a little something for you.

03:13.326 --> 03:14.457
What would you
like to sing, Ree?

03:15.988 --> 03:17.922
How old is she?

03:17.957 --> 03:19.693
She's 10,

03:19.728 --> 03:21.926
but her voice's
going on 30, honey.

03:21.961 --> 03:24.566
Aretha would
like to perform

03:24.601 --> 03:26.634
My Baby Likes to Bebop.

03:26.933 --> 03:28.471
Damn!

03:28.506 --> 03:29.934
I was gonna record that
on my next album.

03:31.674 --> 03:33.278
Can we do a duet?

03:43.422 --> 03:46.654
'Cause my baby likes to bebop

03:55.830 --> 03:56.829
Sing, baby!

04:08.711 --> 04:12.416
Do a dance and a flip-flop

04:12.451 --> 04:15.320
Like the hepcats do

04:15.355 --> 04:18.553
"My baby likes to bebop"

04:43.548 --> 04:45.042
Back to bed with you.

04:56.495 --> 04:59.859
Go marching in

04:59.894 --> 05:02.664
Those white folks don't know
what to do with her.

05:02.699 --> 05:04.369
Sock it to 'em, Clara!

05:04.404 --> 05:05.535
Yeah, Grandma!

05:05.570 --> 05:08.406
Sock it to 'em!
Sock it to 'em!

05:16.911 --> 05:17.844
Momma's here!

05:22.719 --> 05:23.883
Momma!
-

05:26.052 --> 05:29.020
God! Babe,
I missed you so much.

05:29.957 --> 05:31.396
Hi! Momma!

05:33.092 --> 05:34.498
Mommy!

05:35.963 --> 05:37.336
My babies!

05:37.998 --> 05:39.866
My precious!

05:50.846 --> 05:52.384
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

05:52.419 --> 05:53.649
-Let's go!
- Bye, Grandma!

05:53.684 --> 05:54.815
Come on, baby!

05:54.850 --> 05:55.849
Let's go in the car!

05:59.855 --> 06:03.956
That way

06:03.991 --> 06:07.663
In the morning sun

06:07.698 --> 06:11.898
The night is new

06:34.021 --> 06:35.559
Sing another one, Momma!

06:35.594 --> 06:37.759
Oh, Ree,
that's the third song now.

06:37.794 --> 06:39.629
Please?

06:39.664 --> 06:40.960
No, I want to talk.

06:40.995 --> 06:42.797
Please?
-Oh, God.

06:43.503 --> 06:44.898
Oh, all right.

06:45.868 --> 06:48.440
What if I sing-talk, hmm?

07:03.820 --> 07:04.918
We praising
the Lord, Momma!

07:06.658 --> 07:08.086
-

07:08.121 --> 07:09.220
-

07:09.256 --> 07:10.990
-

07:21.541 --> 07:23.871
You still singing
at the Saturday night parties?

07:23.906 --> 07:25.037
Yeah.

07:25.072 --> 07:26.907
Mmm. Don't say "yeah".

07:26.942 --> 07:29.811
"Yeah" is common. Say "yes".

07:29.846 --> 07:30.944
Yes.

07:31.584 --> 07:32.946
You enjoy it?

07:32.981 --> 07:34.783
-Yeah. Yes.
-Uh-uh.

07:36.248 --> 07:39.018
Look at me, Ree.

07:39.053 --> 07:41.691
If you ever don't
want to sing, don't.

07:41.726 --> 07:42.890
I love singing.

07:42.925 --> 07:44.595
No, I know. I know.

07:46.830 --> 07:49.633
Your daddy doesn't
own your voice, Ree.

07:49.668 --> 07:51.998
Nobody does but God.

07:53.067 --> 07:55.870
And you don't ever
have to fear any man.

07:57.236 --> 07:58.741
You understand?

08:01.075 --> 08:03.548
You are so worthy, Ree.

08:03.583 --> 08:05.880
Don't you ever let anybody
tell you otherwise.

08:06.817 --> 08:08.047
Yes, Momma.

08:12.724 --> 08:14.086
Oh, Ree, don't cry.

08:14.121 --> 08:15.923
Come on, I'll see you
for your birthday.

08:15.958 --> 08:17.056
Three weeks is a long time.

08:17.091 --> 08:19.861
I know, but I am
always with you.

08:19.896 --> 08:21.500
Even when I'm not there.

08:21.865 --> 08:23.029
Okay?

08:28.839 --> 08:30.036
Go.

08:42.985 --> 08:45.557
Ree, get back here!

08:48.056 --> 08:49.121
Ree!

08:52.258 --> 08:53.092
Goodbye!

08:57.670 --> 08:59.065
Bye, Momma!

09:03.973 --> 09:05.104
We're marching
Marching up to Zion

09:08.747 --> 09:09.680
Ree?

09:10.078 --> 09:11.110
Ree?

09:13.081 --> 09:15.312
I'm the oldest. I should be
in the front of the line.

09:15.347 --> 09:16.115
Hush.

09:18.955 --> 09:20.823
We have nothing
to fear, church.

09:22.288 --> 09:25.762
'Cause what is the white man
compared to God?

09:29.229 --> 09:32.164
What is any law, any injustice

09:32.199 --> 09:34.870
compared to the power
of our Lord?

09:38.370 --> 09:42.845
'Cause He will deliver us
from the den like Daniel.

09:44.178 --> 09:47.311
And Daniel went
into that lion's den.

09:48.248 --> 09:51.689
Daniel went into
that lion's den.

09:51.724 --> 09:53.889
-Yes, Jesus!
-Not yelling,

09:53.924 --> 09:55.693
nor fussing.

09:55.728 --> 09:56.892
Not crying!

09:56.927 --> 09:58.894
-Not complaining!
-No!

09:58.929 --> 10:00.324
Praising the Lord!

10:00.359 --> 10:02.832
-Yeah!
-'Cause he knew

10:02.867 --> 10:04.636
the Lord was with him.

10:04.671 --> 10:07.199
He feared no man!

10:07.234 --> 10:09.036
Can you hear me, church?

10:09.071 --> 10:10.774
I wish somebody
would pray with me

10:10.809 --> 10:12.776
-'cause He will!
-He will!

10:12.811 --> 10:14.239
He will!
-He will!

10:14.274 --> 10:17.374
He will shut the jaws
of segregation,

10:17.409 --> 10:19.178
and any man, person,

10:19.213 --> 10:21.686
or institution that would dare

10:21.721 --> 10:23.655
stand against us.

10:23.690 --> 10:26.350
He took us from slavery,

10:26.385 --> 10:29.727
he took us from
the valley of reconstruction.

10:29.762 --> 10:31.729
- Freedom!

10:31.764 --> 10:33.390
-Freedom!
- Freedom!

10:33.425 --> 10:34.831
Freedom!

10:34.866 --> 10:36.195
-Freedom!
- Freedom!

10:36.230 --> 10:38.967
Freedom now!
Praise Him! Praise Him!

10:39.002 --> 10:41.772
-Preach, Daddy, preach!
- Hallelujah.

10:50.717 --> 10:52.750
Hey? Ree?

10:52.785 --> 10:54.818
Ree!

10:54.853 --> 10:56.721
How come
you're not singing tonight?

10:57.724 --> 10:59.317
Daddy didn't ask me to.

11:00.892 --> 11:02.793
What's your doll's name?

11:06.392 --> 11:07.963
Dee.

11:07.998 --> 11:10.669
Mmm. That's a pretty name.

11:13.036 --> 11:15.036
You're pretty, too.

11:15.071 --> 11:16.433
What's your boyfriend's name?

11:16.468 --> 11:18.941
I don't have
a boyfriend.

11:19.878 --> 11:21.845
I can be your boyfriend.

11:21.880 --> 11:23.209
Would you like that?

11:24.410 --> 11:26.212
We'll have fun.

11:58.378 --> 11:59.982
Come on, Ree!

12:01.920 --> 12:03.150
I don't want to.

12:03.185 --> 12:04.789
Ree, I will beat your behind.

12:10.258 --> 12:11.961
What are you doing?

12:11.996 --> 12:13.424
I don't care if you beat me.

12:13.459 --> 12:15.228
I don't want my hair done.

12:15.263 --> 12:17.032
Don't you wanna look pretty
for church tomorrow?

12:17.067 --> 12:18.902
No!

12:18.937 --> 12:20.266
Y'all wait in the living room.

12:21.203 --> 12:23.170
Come on.

12:23.205 --> 12:24.435
Don't sweat out all my work.

12:24.470 --> 12:26.140
That's gotta last you
all week!

12:28.540 --> 12:30.012
Sit down.

12:35.382 --> 12:37.151
You wanna tell me
what's wrong?

12:39.353 --> 12:40.418
Ree-Ree?

12:47.130 --> 12:49.933
I know you don't
wanna tell me,

12:49.968 --> 12:53.101
but you can always
tell the Lord, Ree.

12:53.136 --> 12:55.301
He loves you, no matter what.

13:28.534 --> 13:31.304
You're supposed
to be in bed, Ree.

13:31.339 --> 13:35.913
my every burden

13:35.948 --> 13:37.079
Come, come and join me
for a while.

13:46.926 --> 13:51.489
Whoa, yes

13:53.031 --> 13:54.360
What if I wasn't here?

13:58.036 --> 14:00.531
What do you mean by that?

14:03.173 --> 14:06.306
-I don't know.
-

14:11.984 --> 14:13.478
Hello?

14:13.513 --> 14:14.985
See how nicely
their voices are blending?

14:16.087 --> 14:18.120
They let Sam
take the proper lead.

14:19.618 --> 14:24.291
Too many members of our choir
try to stand out

14:24.326 --> 14:25.457
instead of supporting
the soloist.

14:25.492 --> 14:26.458
Clarence?

14:28.363 --> 14:30.066
Come to the phone.

14:32.103 --> 14:34.466
-Play this next.
-Okay.

14:37.009 --> 14:38.305
Right back.

14:43.279 --> 14:45.510
Barbara's dead.
- How?

14:45.545 --> 14:47.479
Heart attack.

14:52.090 --> 14:54.453
I'll tell them
in the morning, Mama.

14:54.488 --> 14:57.324
No. No, you cannot
wait till tomorrow

14:57.359 --> 15:00.327
to tell them
their momma is dead.

15:00.362 --> 15:01.559
-

15:06.104 --> 15:07.367
No. No.

15:09.008 --> 15:10.073
Ree?

15:34.297 --> 15:35.494
Ree?

15:46.672 --> 15:48.342
I'm sorry, baby.

15:50.280 --> 15:52.511
Let's go inside.

16:14.073 --> 16:19.439
dear Ree-Ree

16:25.711 --> 16:27.513
Come on now, Ree.

16:31.189 --> 16:33.024
She just miss her momma.

16:33.059 --> 16:34.355
They all missin' her,

16:34.786 --> 16:37.193
but how long
she gonna keep silent?

16:37.228 --> 16:38.623
Goin' on three weeks.
She gotta...

16:38.658 --> 16:41.527
She just needs a little time.
That's all.

16:41.727 --> 16:43.067
Ree?

16:44.466 --> 16:48.732
Miss Clara made you
this beautiful cake,

16:48.767 --> 16:50.668
and Reverend James
came especially for you.

16:51.374 --> 16:53.209
What do you say, Ree?

16:56.610 --> 16:58.049
Do you say, "Thank you"?

16:59.481 --> 17:00.579
-Do you say something?
-

17:02.286 --> 17:03.714
Make a wish, Ree.

17:07.621 --> 17:08.587
I can't do this.

17:11.426 --> 17:14.395
Come on.
- Momma. Momma.

17:14.430 --> 17:15.560
Come on, baby. It's all right.

17:15.596 --> 17:16.561
-Momma. Momma.
-It's all right.

17:16.597 --> 17:18.564
-Come on, baby.
-Momma.

17:18.598 --> 17:22.469
-

17:29.775 --> 17:31.544
Why are you hiding over there?

17:31.579 --> 17:33.645
Come on over here
and get your lesson.

17:34.681 --> 17:36.681
You know this one.

17:37.816 --> 17:40.355
Tell you what,
I'll be the choir

17:40.390 --> 17:41.719
and you play the lead.

17:45.428 --> 17:46.823
Three, four...

17:58.804 --> 18:01.541
Ree is helping me
with my arrangement.

18:01.576 --> 18:02.740
I see.

18:03.875 --> 18:05.776
Has she spoken to you?

18:05.811 --> 18:08.614
that far

18:12.422 --> 18:16.589
Do you think you can
stay silent forever, Ree? Hmm?

18:21.695 --> 18:22.760
Look at me.

18:26.832 --> 18:29.536
We must honor the gifts
that God has given us, Ree.

18:31.177 --> 18:34.772
You will be singing
in church tomorrow.

18:36.908 --> 18:39.381
James, can you prepare her?

18:40.417 --> 18:42.318
Yes, sir.

18:42.353 --> 18:43.583
Thank you.

19:07.543 --> 19:09.807
Don't let nothin' come between
you and your music, Ree.

19:13.384 --> 19:15.681
Music will save your life.

19:21.623 --> 19:23.656
God holds our hand.

19:23.691 --> 19:24.723
Yeah!
-Through Him,

19:24.758 --> 19:27.198
we can do anything!

19:27.233 --> 19:28.595
He's a catcher!

19:28.630 --> 19:30.663
A dream catcher!

19:30.698 --> 19:32.335
Amen!

19:32.370 --> 19:33.501
Amen.
- Amen.

19:35.439 --> 19:37.241
And now,

19:37.276 --> 19:40.640
my daughter Aretha
will bless us with song.

21:03.021 --> 21:08.497
-
guilty stains

21:11.062 --> 21:17.341
Lose all their
guilty stains
-

21:17.376 --> 21:20.608
-

21:40.564 --> 21:42.795
-

21:42.830 --> 21:44.599
-

21:51.839 --> 21:53.839
-

21:57.812 --> 22:02.980
running through the flood?

22:17.997 --> 22:20.503
I wonder,
do you feel all right?

22:20.538 --> 22:21.834
Yes!

22:21.869 --> 22:22.967
I said,
do you feel all right?

22:23.002 --> 22:24.507
Yes!

22:25.543 --> 22:27.004
Amen.

22:28.678 --> 22:31.646
I'm ecstatic to be able
to report to you

22:31.681 --> 22:34.979
that the day before yesterday,
we filled up the jail.

22:36.785 --> 22:39.115
We have already won a victory
here in Birmingham.

22:39.150 --> 22:40.391
Amen!

22:41.625 --> 22:43.526
Due, in no small part,

22:43.561 --> 22:46.089
to the valiant work
of our leader.

22:46.124 --> 22:48.960
A man whom I feel
honored to call my friend.

22:50.502 --> 22:54.867
The Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

22:54.902 --> 22:58.409
All right! Yes, sir!
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

23:03.845 --> 23:05.548
Come on! Somebody!

23:13.492 --> 23:15.888
Some people

23:15.923 --> 23:18.891
think that we are crazy

23:18.926 --> 23:20.893
for taking on this fight.

23:20.928 --> 23:22.466
Yes!

23:22.501 --> 23:25.832
But the forces against us
are strong,

23:25.867 --> 23:28.967
and they are determined
to stop us.

23:29.002 --> 23:33.103
But we are just
as determined to go on!

23:35.778 --> 23:37.943
Non-violently,

23:38.880 --> 23:41.111
with love.

23:41.146 --> 23:44.455
As long as it takes
to win our freedom.

23:44.490 --> 23:45.588
Yes!

23:46.791 --> 23:49.856
And Jesus is here with us
every single step of the way.

23:52.025 --> 23:53.464
Amen!

23:53.499 --> 23:54.432
Yes, sir!

23:56.029 --> 23:57.600
Uncle Martin...

23:57.635 --> 24:01.131
Now don't call me
Uncle Martin anymore.

24:01.166 --> 24:02.638
You make me feel old,
that's the problem.

24:02.673 --> 24:03.870
I want to march.

24:04.906 --> 24:06.609
Don't look at me
like I'm still a child.

24:06.644 --> 24:07.775
I'm not afraid.

24:07.810 --> 24:09.480
-Oh, you're not?
-No.

24:09.515 --> 24:10.910
Well, damn.

24:10.945 --> 24:12.912
Then you need to be
leadin' this movement

24:12.947 --> 24:15.013
and teaching me how to not be

24:15.048 --> 24:17.180
terrified of these
crazy white folks.

24:17.215 --> 24:19.490
Martin...
-

24:19.987 --> 24:22.053
Why do you want to march?

24:22.088 --> 24:25.023
After all this time
traveling with you,

24:25.058 --> 24:26.662
after all the horror
we've seen,

24:26.697 --> 24:27.993
what kind of question is that?

24:30.932 --> 24:32.965
Are you runnin'
from your daddy?

24:33.000 --> 24:34.065
No.

24:36.069 --> 24:39.675
So, you tell him
you wanna march?

24:39.710 --> 24:41.512
I don't have to.

24:41.547 --> 24:43.976
It's my decision.
I'm a grown woman, remember?

24:44.011 --> 24:48.651
Oh, so, you ready
to orphan your kids now, hmm?

24:48.686 --> 24:50.851
-Are you?
-No.

24:50.886 --> 24:51.852
But you're doing it anyway.

24:51.887 --> 24:54.184
Because I have to.

24:54.219 --> 24:55.955
-And I don't?
-Ree...

24:55.990 --> 24:57.957
Singing for the movement

24:57.992 --> 25:00.663
and sending people
into battle with a song

25:00.698 --> 25:02.797
is not enough anymore.

25:02.832 --> 25:03.963
I need to be with them.

25:04.966 --> 25:06.031
You have a good talk?

25:07.298 --> 25:08.704
Yes.

25:14.305 --> 25:16.041
It was a good talk.

25:16.879 --> 25:18.879
Brother, come on.

25:18.914 --> 25:20.980
She's restless, I can tell.

25:21.015 --> 25:23.180
I... I... I don't know
if it's restless.

25:24.249 --> 25:26.821
She just wants to do more.

25:26.856 --> 25:28.086
What kind of more?

25:39.165 --> 25:40.098
I'll be there in a minute.

25:43.609 --> 25:44.839
Momma!

25:44.874 --> 25:47.710
Clarence! Eddie!

25:47.745 --> 25:50.680
-Momma! Momma! Momma!
-My babies! My babies!

25:53.014 --> 25:54.717
-Are you all right, baby?
-

25:54.752 --> 25:57.918
Clarence, you go in your room
and wait for me.

25:57.953 --> 25:59.755
Come here. It's all right,
baby, it's all right.

25:59.790 --> 26:01.020
Come on. Come on.

26:01.055 --> 26:03.187
It's all right.
It's all right.

26:03.222 --> 26:05.860
Every time I come
back, they want me less.

26:05.895 --> 26:07.158
That's not true.

26:07.193 --> 26:09.732
They talk about you
all the time.

26:09.767 --> 26:12.064
Every night, I show 'em
where you are on the map.

26:12.671 --> 26:14.132
One cookie.

26:18.941 --> 26:20.006
Fix your face now.

26:20.712 --> 26:22.206
This party is for y'all.

26:22.241 --> 26:23.944
-How are you, Mama?
-God is good.

26:23.979 --> 26:25.143
All the time.

26:26.652 --> 26:28.212
Let's eat. I'm starving.

26:29.347 --> 26:31.248
-

26:32.790 --> 26:34.086
So, where y'all headed?

26:34.121 --> 26:37.155
We go to Tennessee,
then to Georgia,

26:37.190 --> 26:40.290
then to North Carolina,
and then back to Alabama,
I think.

26:40.325 --> 26:42.831
Damn. Martin's tour's busier
than Daddy's.

26:42.866 --> 26:46.637
Erma, sometimes we hit
two states in one day.

26:46.672 --> 26:50.333
What was that story about
Aunt Mahalia not paying you?

26:50.368 --> 26:53.908
She said I would receive
my reward in Heaven.

26:58.211 --> 26:59.342
Oh.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.148
No, Ree. Uh-uh.

27:13.831 --> 27:15.226
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

27:15.261 --> 27:16.865
-Smokey...
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.

27:16.900 --> 27:18.328
He's got some news, Ree.

27:18.363 --> 27:20.099
I heard
you're cuttin' a record.

27:20.134 --> 27:22.101
Yeah, with Berry
over at Motown.

27:22.136 --> 27:23.905
They got some
sweet sounds, Ree.

27:23.940 --> 27:25.434
They're signing a bunch of
folks in the neighborhood.

27:25.469 --> 27:27.942
Listen, we are trying
to put Detroit on the map.

27:27.977 --> 27:29.240
You gotta be a part of it.

27:29.275 --> 27:31.682
-I would love that.
-Yeah?

27:31.717 --> 27:33.145
Cecil, let me talk
to Daddy about it.

27:33.180 --> 27:34.817
Don't bring it up until I say.

27:34.852 --> 27:36.819
You know what?
Let's let Berry talk to him.

27:36.854 --> 27:38.249
Better yet, his sister.

27:38.284 --> 27:40.691
She can talk ice
out of the devil's mouth.

27:42.057 --> 27:43.320
What are you drinking?

27:44.125 --> 27:45.663
Iced tea.

27:47.128 --> 27:50.261
Just iced tea?

27:52.199 --> 27:55.200
-With a little bourbon.
-

27:56.742 --> 27:58.973
Yeah, you look
like a bourbon girl.

28:01.274 --> 28:02.845
How long are you in town for?

28:02.880 --> 28:04.011
A week.

28:04.046 --> 28:05.749
Then I return to Tennessee.

28:05.784 --> 28:07.377
Well, then,
I won't waste any time.

28:07.412 --> 28:08.917
Mm.

28:08.952 --> 28:11.722
-I'd like to take you out.
-Hmm.

28:11.757 --> 28:13.350
I'd like you to take me out.

28:13.891 --> 28:15.220
How about tonight?

28:16.487 --> 28:18.157
Ree!

28:18.192 --> 28:19.895
Come and help me
set this table.

28:21.833 --> 28:24.867
Yes, to tonight.

28:24.902 --> 28:27.232
-Okay.
-Excuse me a moment.

28:37.046 --> 28:39.211
Reverend.

28:39.246 --> 28:42.016
I put up with you coming
to my house all these years

28:42.051 --> 28:44.414
'cause you were friends
with my friends.

28:44.449 --> 28:46.416
But I don't want you
around here anymore.

28:46.451 --> 28:48.385
May I give you some counsel,
Reverend?

28:49.828 --> 28:52.191
Ephesians 6:4 says, "Fathers,

28:52.226 --> 28:54.424
do not exasperate
your children.

28:54.459 --> 28:56.228
Instead, bring them up
in the training

28:56.263 --> 28:58.329
and the instruction
of the Lord."

28:58.364 --> 29:00.067
Lord, give me strength.

29:00.102 --> 29:01.464
Are you serious?

29:01.499 --> 29:04.434
You may wanna loosen
your grip on Aretha.

29:04.469 --> 29:06.007
You know, every minister's
daughter I've ever known...

29:06.042 --> 29:07.404
Nigga, you don't
wanna mess with me...

29:08.341 --> 29:09.406
or mine.

29:30.836 --> 29:32.297
I got this.

29:33.102 --> 29:34.431
I got it.

29:42.914 --> 29:44.342
-

29:44.377 --> 29:45.816
Whoo!
-

29:45.851 --> 29:47.114
Whoo!

29:48.854 --> 29:50.953
I love to party

29:52.253 --> 29:54.286
I want you by my side

29:54.321 --> 29:55.452
Take that off.

29:59.931 --> 30:02.558
-Everyone! everyone!
-

30:02.593 --> 30:05.462
Please, please, gather around.

30:07.906 --> 30:09.807
Aretha, will you join me,
please?

30:15.144 --> 30:17.848
This party is not just, uh,

30:17.883 --> 30:19.311
a homecoming.

30:19.346 --> 30:22.413
It's also an announcement.

30:22.448 --> 30:26.417
God is moving us
on to our next chapter.

30:29.290 --> 30:31.455
I've been talking to a number
of record producers

30:31.490 --> 30:32.995
about Aretha.

30:33.030 --> 30:34.898
There were many

30:34.933 --> 30:36.361
who were interested
in working with her.

30:39.432 --> 30:41.531
Tell them what it is, Ree.

30:41.566 --> 30:42.400
Ah...

30:44.910 --> 30:46.404
A plane ticket
to New York City.

30:52.082 --> 30:53.510
Congratulations, Ree.

30:55.580 --> 30:57.415
Thank you.

31:01.355 --> 31:02.860
This is it.

31:04.325 --> 31:05.863
Wow.

31:07.625 --> 31:09.559
Excuse me?

31:09.594 --> 31:11.561
I have a meeting
with a John Hammond

31:11.596 --> 31:12.936
of Columbia Records.

31:12.971 --> 31:14.498
Sign in, please.

31:22.343 --> 31:23.914
You ready?

31:25.346 --> 31:27.049
-I'm ready.

31:33.486 --> 31:38.192
I've always seen Aretha
as more than a gospel singer.

31:38.227 --> 31:41.261
Well, clearly from her demo,
she's so much more.

31:43.001 --> 31:44.429
Stand up, Ree.

31:45.630 --> 31:47.564
Turn around.

31:49.238 --> 31:52.074
There can sometimes be
a lack of effortlessness

31:52.109 --> 31:53.603
of the kind you find

31:53.638 --> 31:57.277
in a Lena Horne
or a Dorothy Dandridge.

31:57.312 --> 32:00.610
But what Aretha lacks
in formal education,

32:00.645 --> 32:03.547
she more than makes up for
in experience.

32:03.582 --> 32:07.958
She has performed before every
type of crowd imaginable,

32:07.993 --> 32:11.456
from small churches
to audiences of thousands.

32:12.492 --> 32:13.491
You can sit down now, Ree.

32:20.401 --> 32:24.139
I... I'm curious.

32:25.703 --> 32:28.506
Who are your favorite artists?

32:28.541 --> 32:30.145
Dinah Washington.

32:30.741 --> 32:32.312
Ella Fitzgerald.

32:32.347 --> 32:33.951
-Hmm.
- Sam Cooke.

32:34.415 --> 32:35.480
All family friends.

32:36.549 --> 32:38.714
Sam would very much
like Aretha

32:38.749 --> 32:40.617
to sign with RCA.

32:41.290 --> 32:43.488
Well, we can't have that.

32:45.360 --> 32:47.525
Welcome

32:47.560 --> 32:49.098
to Columbia Records.

32:57.768 --> 32:59.141
Prove yourself

33:00.639 --> 33:02.540
as a jazz artist, and
everything else will follow.

33:02.575 --> 33:04.047
I understand.

33:04.082 --> 33:05.378
Wonderful.

33:15.456 --> 33:17.423
Are you ready, Aretha?

33:17.458 --> 33:19.557
-Yes, Mr. Hammond.
-Wonderful.

33:19.592 --> 33:21.196
The conductor
will point at you

33:21.231 --> 33:22.593
when he's ready
for you to begin.

33:36.213 --> 33:40.578
accentuate the positive

33:44.551 --> 33:48.058
to the affirmative

33:48.093 --> 33:49.389
with mister in-between

33:49.424 --> 33:50.456
She sounds wonderful,
doesn't she?

33:50.491 --> 33:51.721
She does.

33:51.756 --> 33:53.789
Like a black Judy Garland.

33:53.824 --> 33:55.593
up to the maximum

33:55.628 --> 33:59.234
down to the minimum

33:59.269 --> 34:02.666
pandemonium

34:02.701 --> 34:06.505
upon the scene

34:06.540 --> 34:08.243
Ladies and gentlemen,

34:08.277 --> 34:10.080
the Village Vanguard
is proud to present

34:10.114 --> 34:11.576
Miss Aretha Franklin,

34:11.610 --> 34:14.083
debuting her latest record,
Unforgettable.

34:21.554 --> 34:24.127
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

34:24.161 --> 34:26.591
We hope you enjoy
the show tonight.

34:27.396 --> 34:29.561
I see an old family friend.

34:29.596 --> 34:32.101
Dinah Washington
is in the audience.

34:39.440 --> 34:40.835
I'd like to sing a song

34:40.871 --> 34:44.641
in honor of her great artistry
and talent.

35:08.239 --> 35:09.799
Bitch!

35:09.834 --> 35:11.636
Don't you ever sing
the Queen's songs

35:11.671 --> 35:12.769
when the Queen
is in front of you!

35:22.352 --> 35:24.484
What the hell
were you thinking?

35:24.849 --> 35:26.288
I'm sorry.

35:26.323 --> 35:27.487
You wanna take me on?

35:27.522 --> 35:29.357
-No.
- Liar.

35:29.392 --> 35:30.886
You wouldn't be here if you
wasn't trying to replace me

35:30.921 --> 35:32.789
and every other bitch
out here singin'.

35:34.529 --> 35:35.891
How many albums have you had?

35:35.926 --> 35:36.859
Four.

35:38.335 --> 35:39.796
And no hits.

35:48.477 --> 35:50.510
You out here,
but I can see you

35:50.545 --> 35:52.512
still that little girl
in your daddy's living room.

35:52.547 --> 35:54.778
You're singin' everything
and anything.

35:54.813 --> 35:57.385
Shoop Shoop one day,
Skylark the next,

35:57.420 --> 35:59.717
and then some
Billie Holiday blues.

35:59.752 --> 36:01.290
Girl, you're all
over the place.

36:01.886 --> 36:02.819
What do you wanna sing?

36:03.954 --> 36:05.294
I don't know.

36:08.365 --> 36:09.727
You don't know?

36:09.762 --> 36:12.796
I want hits. I just want hits.

36:12.831 --> 36:14.732
Girl, you need to let go
of that "up with the race"

36:14.767 --> 36:17.405
Booker T. Washington
proper Negro shit.

36:17.440 --> 36:18.901
That's not you.

36:18.936 --> 36:20.606
Your daddy likes to pretend
that's who he is,

36:20.641 --> 36:22.608
but that's not
who he is either.

36:22.643 --> 36:25.215
Child, y'all church folks

36:25.250 --> 36:27.943
are some of the nastiest
people out here.

36:27.978 --> 36:30.517
Ray Charles told me
that the best sex he ever had

36:30.552 --> 36:32.222
was when he was singin'
on the gospel circuit.

36:33.819 --> 36:37.755
Honey, find the songs
that suit you. That move you.

36:37.790 --> 36:41.198
Until you do that,
you ain't goin' nowhere.

36:44.929 --> 36:46.533
Put some teabags on that.

36:47.668 --> 36:48.865
Take the puffiness down.

36:54.312 --> 36:55.542
How's Big Mama?

36:57.348 --> 36:58.611
She's all right.

36:58.976 --> 36:59.876
The kids?

37:01.550 --> 37:03.385
They're good.

37:03.420 --> 37:05.486
Child, you ever gonna tell us
who their daddy is?

37:36.849 --> 37:38.684
Ree-Ree?

37:38.719 --> 37:39.883
You wanna tell me
what's wrong?

37:39.918 --> 37:40.917
I can't.

38:12.489 --> 38:13.752
No answer.

38:14.524 --> 38:15.622
Call her again.

38:20.761 --> 38:21.660
Hmm.

38:23.093 --> 38:25.335
I didn't know you were
comin' in today, Daddy.

38:25.370 --> 38:26.798
You are 68 minutes late.

38:26.833 --> 38:29.999
Mr. Hammond
asked me to come in.

38:30.034 --> 38:33.904
You've been skipping
interviews and gigs.

38:34.940 --> 38:37.611
The demon is back.

38:37.646 --> 38:40.878
Ree has a tendency
to indulge her pain.

38:40.913 --> 38:43.078
Can we talk about this
somewhere else?

38:43.113 --> 38:45.047
John. John.

38:45.082 --> 38:48.556
It's important that you
understand that this behavior

38:48.591 --> 38:53.055
is not a reflection
of her upbringing or her race.

38:53.090 --> 38:54.760
Well, I've worked
with Bessie Smith

38:54.795 --> 38:55.959
and Billie Holiday.

38:55.994 --> 38:58.368
Aretha is a saint
in comparison.

38:58.403 --> 39:00.502
She wasn't raised in
a whorehouse like them.

39:00.537 --> 39:02.801
She was raised
in a proper home

39:02.836 --> 39:04.935
with every convenience
and luxury.

39:06.939 --> 39:10.776
But still, a darkness
would descend on her.

39:10.811 --> 39:12.415
I called it the demon.

39:12.450 --> 39:15.847
She'd lock herself away,
wouldn't speak, move,

39:15.882 --> 39:17.816
just wallow
in whatever imaginary...

39:18.489 --> 39:19.554
I...

39:22.119 --> 39:24.724
You told me before
we came out here

39:24.759 --> 39:25.659
that you had it under control.

39:25.694 --> 39:27.023
I have control.

39:29.159 --> 39:32.402
You keep complaining
that you don't have any hits.

39:32.437 --> 39:34.932
This is why
you don't have any hits.

39:34.967 --> 39:36.032
Acting like a trifling...

39:39.708 --> 39:40.971
Apologize to Mr. Hammond.

39:41.006 --> 39:43.072
No, there's no need
to apologize.

39:43.107 --> 39:45.844
That is not why
I don't have hits.

39:45.879 --> 39:47.043
You don't pick
good songs for me.

39:55.152 --> 39:57.592
Sorry for being late,
Mr. Hammond.

39:59.992 --> 40:01.596
It won't happen again.

40:03.193 --> 40:05.061
I'm ready to record
when you are.

40:05.800 --> 40:06.997
Hmm.

40:10.739 --> 40:13.443
Please excuse me while
I go to the ladies' room.

40:29.021 --> 40:31.593
So, you gonna come
with us this weekend?

40:31.628 --> 40:32.759
I have a gig.

40:32.794 --> 40:34.464
We can go after your gig.

40:35.192 --> 40:37.060
You work too hard.

40:37.095 --> 40:39.436
-Not according to my daddy.
-

40:40.670 --> 40:42.736
Well, you need some fun.

40:42.771 --> 40:43.968
Come with us.

40:52.044 --> 40:54.077
Can you introduce me
to his friend?

40:54.783 --> 40:56.046
I don't know him.

41:09.534 --> 41:11.193
-

41:21.810 --> 41:24.008
-

41:36.088 --> 41:38.726
You were supposed
to take me out in Detroit.

41:38.761 --> 41:40.090
Yes, one of my singers

41:40.125 --> 41:41.795
ran into a little trouble
out of town,

41:41.830 --> 41:44.193
so I had to take care of it.

41:44.228 --> 41:46.195
I think my father
said something to you

41:46.230 --> 41:48.835
-to make you reconsider.
-Oh.

41:48.870 --> 41:52.267
That's a nice little fable
you got goin' on in your head.

41:53.974 --> 41:55.105
I know what you do.

41:57.747 --> 41:59.241
It doesn't bother me.

42:00.783 --> 42:04.147
I know it doesn't bother you.

42:04.182 --> 42:07.084
You're rebelling against
your daddy.

42:07.119 --> 42:08.250
I don't mind.

42:09.253 --> 42:12.188
Listen, you wanna
use me for my body,

42:12.861 --> 42:14.861
you can use me, baby.

42:14.896 --> 42:17.226
You can wring me dry.

42:17.261 --> 42:20.031
You and me,
we've been through it.

42:21.001 --> 42:23.298
So we can skip all the flowers

42:23.333 --> 42:25.168
and the promises,
and the love bullshit,

42:25.203 --> 42:27.005
and just have some fun.

42:27.040 --> 42:28.842
I like fun.

42:28.877 --> 42:30.206
And we'll have plenty of it.

42:34.311 --> 42:36.014
I want one thing from you.

42:37.281 --> 42:38.115
What?

42:39.349 --> 42:41.019
To hear you sing.

42:41.054 --> 42:42.856
Just for me.

42:42.891 --> 42:45.023
What will I get in return?

42:45.828 --> 42:48.224
The best night of your life.

43:17.794 --> 43:18.925
Taxi!

43:36.010 --> 43:38.978
I want you to think about me
when you sing tomorrow.

43:39.013 --> 43:40.914
You're not coming home
with me?

43:41.411 --> 43:43.246
No.

43:43.281 --> 43:45.248
What about the best night
of my life?

43:45.283 --> 43:47.151
I didn't say
it would be tonight.

43:57.966 --> 44:02.001
enchanted boy

44:02.036 --> 44:08.073
Very far

44:30.999 --> 44:35.331
He passed my way

44:37.434 --> 44:38.939
I'm sorry.

44:40.008 --> 44:41.337
I'm sorry.

44:44.947 --> 44:46.848
Would you like
to take a break, Aretha?

44:47.345 --> 44:48.982
No.

44:49.017 --> 44:50.247
I'll get it right this time.

44:51.217 --> 44:52.414
Take 12.

45:11.237 --> 45:15.404
enchanted boy

45:15.439 --> 45:21.212
Very far

45:44.468 --> 45:48.470
he passed my way

45:48.505 --> 45:51.913
of many things

46:20.537 --> 46:22.438
You have all my records.

46:25.047 --> 46:26.409
You like them?

46:26.444 --> 46:27.443
I bought them.

46:29.986 --> 46:31.381
Which one you like best?

46:33.253 --> 46:34.384
They've all got something.

46:36.124 --> 46:37.827
Is this one your favorite?

46:40.128 --> 46:41.193
Hmm?

46:44.528 --> 46:45.934
Or this?

46:48.906 --> 46:50.268
What are you doing?

46:50.303 --> 46:51.874
Or this one?

46:51.909 --> 46:54.107
Went to 64 on the charts.

46:56.144 --> 46:58.012
You didn't even open this one.

47:00.445 --> 47:01.378
You don't like them?

47:02.282 --> 47:03.446
I didn't say that.

47:03.481 --> 47:04.986
Then say it.

47:05.021 --> 47:06.416
I won't be upset.

47:06.957 --> 47:08.990
No one does.

47:09.025 --> 47:11.861
First, I've listened
to all your albums.

47:12.589 --> 47:15.161
Including this one.

47:15.966 --> 47:17.427
More than once.

47:19.068 --> 47:22.135
Secondly, I love music.

47:22.170 --> 47:24.467
I take it seriously.

47:24.502 --> 47:27.305
I managed my first artist
when I was 15.

47:27.340 --> 47:31.045
Thirdly, what you
experienced yesterday,

47:31.080 --> 47:33.575
17 takes on one song?

47:33.610 --> 47:36.314
That happens to me
every time I hear you sing.

47:37.251 --> 47:39.416
My brain gets all...

47:40.584 --> 47:42.419
muddled.

47:42.454 --> 47:46.896
Well, first,

47:46.931 --> 47:50.526
my apologies for putting
you through so much pain.

47:53.102 --> 47:56.169
-And secondly...
-Mm-hmm.

47:56.204 --> 47:59.172
...you should have never told
me about your Achilles' heel.

48:00.340 --> 48:02.175
On our first date.

48:11.384 --> 48:13.318
Oh, damn it.

48:13.353 --> 48:16.288
-

48:20.624 --> 48:24.230
-Keep singing.
-

48:24.265 --> 48:25.968
I didn't think you were
comin' home for two weeks.

48:26.003 --> 48:27.464
-I miss my babies.
-

48:27.499 --> 48:28.971
And y'all.

48:31.041 --> 48:32.205
Who's that plate for?

48:33.274 --> 48:34.471
Ted.

48:34.506 --> 48:37.980
Oh, sweet Jesus,
are you serious?

48:38.015 --> 48:39.278
-What are you thinking?
-Please help me with Daddy.

48:39.313 --> 48:40.312
-No...
-Help me.

48:41.018 --> 48:42.182
Good Sunday, everybody.

48:48.322 --> 48:50.960
What the hell is this?

48:50.995 --> 48:52.522
You didn't tell them
I was coming?

48:52.557 --> 48:53.996
I don't know what you think
you're doing here

48:54.031 --> 48:55.096
and I don't care.

48:55.131 --> 48:57.263
Just leave. Now.

48:57.298 --> 48:58.627
Aretha asked me to come

48:58.662 --> 49:00.431
and Aretha
can ask me to leave.

49:01.731 --> 49:04.270
-I want him to stay.
-This is my house.

49:04.305 --> 49:05.634
Since when do
you get to tell me

49:05.669 --> 49:07.504
who gets to be in my house,
Ree, huh?

49:07.539 --> 49:09.506
I want you to get to know him.

49:09.541 --> 49:10.672
He's not what you think.

49:10.707 --> 49:11.706
Are you pregnant again?

49:11.741 --> 49:13.213
No!

49:14.348 --> 49:16.381
We just wanna be together.

49:18.055 --> 49:19.549
I love your daughter,
Reverend.

49:21.685 --> 49:24.026
And I think she loves me.

49:24.061 --> 49:25.390
I do.

49:25.425 --> 49:27.062
-No! No!
- Oh, my Lord!

49:27.097 --> 49:28.163
Ree...
- Clarence! No!

49:28.198 --> 49:30.197
Didn't I tell you
not to mess with me or mine?

49:30.232 --> 49:31.099
-Didn't I tell you?
-Clarence!

49:31.134 --> 49:32.463
Son, don't you let this man

49:32.498 --> 49:34.366
put your church
and your soul in jeopardy.

49:45.709 --> 49:46.983
Reverend,

49:48.316 --> 49:49.546
we have to figure this out.

49:49.581 --> 49:51.614
I'm not going anywhere.

49:51.649 --> 49:53.715
You can't see
through this hustler?

49:53.750 --> 49:56.751
-You're the greatest hustler
I ever seen.
-

49:56.786 --> 49:59.688
Every night, she picks herself
apart because of you.

49:59.723 --> 50:03.065
She thinks it's her hair,
her body, her voice.

50:03.100 --> 50:05.166
She worries about failing you,
but it's your failure.

50:05.201 --> 50:07.069
Get out! Just...

50:07.104 --> 50:09.434
Daddy, I know
how busy you are.

50:09.469 --> 50:11.634
You have so much
going on all the time.

50:11.669 --> 50:13.570
Running a church,
the speakin' engagements,

50:13.605 --> 50:16.441
managing Carolyn.

50:16.476 --> 50:18.641
I know about your contract
at Horizon Records.

50:18.676 --> 50:20.478
I was gonna tell you.

50:20.513 --> 50:22.249
When?
When the damn album came out?

50:22.284 --> 50:24.218
Nobody can tell you anything,
Ree. You're so jealous.

50:24.253 --> 50:25.714
Jealous? Of you two?

50:25.749 --> 50:27.188
You think you better than us?

50:27.223 --> 50:28.486
That's exactly

50:28.521 --> 50:29.454
-what she's saying.
- No!

50:29.489 --> 50:31.555
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet!

50:32.756 --> 50:35.361
You are not
leaving this family

50:35.396 --> 50:37.297
for that piece of trash.

50:39.103 --> 50:41.301
I need a change.

50:42.403 --> 50:44.601
I wanna sing what I wanna sing

50:44.636 --> 50:47.505
and I wanna dress
like I want to dress.

50:48.277 --> 50:49.606
And I want Ted to manage me.

50:51.313 --> 50:54.149
He's not worth the shit
at the bottom of my shoe.

50:54.184 --> 50:56.349
So that means that you think
I'm worth less than that.

50:56.384 --> 50:57.680
After all we've been through.

50:57.715 --> 50:59.187
After all that
I've done for you.

51:04.392 --> 51:06.656
I have to do this, Daddy.

51:12.136 --> 51:15.599
You are going to beg me
to take you back.

51:18.835 --> 51:20.637
But I won't.

51:21.310 --> 51:22.639
I won't.

51:42.826 --> 51:45.662
I'm gonna say goodbye
to my children.

51:45.697 --> 51:47.829
-Okay.
-And then we'll go.

51:47.864 --> 51:48.830
Okay.

52:03.583 --> 52:04.846
Y'all not gonna fix me a plate?

52:30.280 --> 52:32.577
with that gun in your hand?

52:36.220 --> 52:37.912
You keep beating up
these club owners,

52:37.947 --> 52:40.288
there won't be any clubs
left for me to sing at.

52:41.357 --> 52:43.621
No one disrespects us.

52:43.656 --> 52:45.524
I just don't know
what else to do...

52:46.362 --> 52:48.560
after nine albums.

52:51.367 --> 52:52.729
Yes, this is Ted White.

52:52.764 --> 52:55.402
I'm calling to speak
to Mr. Whitfield.

52:55.437 --> 52:57.734
Well, I'd like to speak to him
about Aretha Franklin.

53:01.245 --> 53:04.246
-Mommy can't cook either.
-It's sticky!

53:06.910 --> 53:08.811
I'm gonna be honest with ya.

53:08.846 --> 53:11.847
Your version of Skylark
is one of my favorite songs.

53:12.553 --> 53:13.882
Thank you, Mr. Wexler.

53:13.917 --> 53:15.620
Oh, please, call me Jerry.

53:15.655 --> 53:17.391
You know what Etta James said
when she heard it?

53:17.426 --> 53:19.426
She said you pissed
all over that song,

53:19.461 --> 53:22.495
and she would never sing it
again in her entire life.

53:22.530 --> 53:24.497
You ruined that song
for Etta James.

53:24.532 --> 53:25.894
That is how good it was.

53:25.929 --> 53:27.632
And I'm not
bullshittin' ya, okay?

53:27.667 --> 53:28.566
A lot of these guys out here

53:28.602 --> 53:29.898
will say anything
to get in your drawers,

53:29.933 --> 53:31.537
but that's not me.

53:31.572 --> 53:33.671
I'm sorry.
All right, I'm crude.

53:33.706 --> 53:36.377
And you're a church girl,
and I should watch my mouth.

53:36.412 --> 53:37.642
I'm sorry.

53:38.612 --> 53:40.777
You do talk, don't ya?
Not just sing?

53:43.683 --> 53:45.320
You are
the sweetest thing, Aretha.

53:46.488 --> 53:48.554
I'd like you to call me
Miss Franklin.

53:48.589 --> 53:51.656
Okay, Miss Franklin.

53:51.691 --> 53:53.427
What songs would
you like to sing?

53:53.462 --> 53:55.264
I want hits.

53:55.299 --> 53:56.727
We're done
with standards.

53:56.762 --> 53:58.795
We want original songs
made for Aretha only.

53:58.830 --> 54:01.666
Great! We are speaking
the same language, my man.

54:01.701 --> 54:02.832
One of the songwriters
I represent

54:02.867 --> 54:04.537
wrote a good song for Aretha,

54:04.572 --> 54:06.407
I Never Loved A Man.

54:06.442 --> 54:08.475
Terrific. I've got the perfect
place to record it.

54:08.510 --> 54:09.839
I'm working with
this little studio

54:09.874 --> 54:11.544
down in Alabama and...

54:11.579 --> 54:13.447
Aretha's only recorded
in New York.

54:13.482 --> 54:15.548
Yeah, I know that, but I think
that's part of the problem.

54:15.583 --> 54:17.385
It's overproduced,
it's a little too polished.

54:17.420 --> 54:18.386
I mean, these boys
down there...

54:18.421 --> 54:20.014
"Boys"?

54:20.049 --> 54:21.686
Don't be offended, all right?

54:21.721 --> 54:23.985
I say boys because
they're young like Aretha,

54:24.020 --> 54:26.625
like Miss Franklin,
not because they're Negroes.

54:26.660 --> 54:28.022
These guys are
the best musicians

54:28.057 --> 54:29.727
I have ever
worked with in my life,

54:29.762 --> 54:31.564
and that's saying something.

54:31.599 --> 54:32.862
I've been doing this
a long time.

54:32.897 --> 54:34.567
They don't need
to read charts.

54:34.602 --> 54:36.899
They just feel their way
through the music.

54:36.934 --> 54:38.967
It's really something.
How does that sound to you?

54:40.410 --> 54:41.772
Sounds good.

54:41.807 --> 54:44.874
And I'm not controlling
like Hammond, okay?

54:44.909 --> 54:46.480
I'm gonna give you
plenty of space

54:46.515 --> 54:47.877
to do your thing, all right?

54:47.912 --> 54:50.319
This is your show,
Miss Franklin.

54:50.354 --> 54:51.518
Your record.

54:51.553 --> 54:52.717
Okay?

55:36.862 --> 55:38.499
This is it?

55:38.534 --> 55:41.403
What did all the glamor
at Columbia get me?

55:41.438 --> 55:42.932
Do you know who
you're messing with?

55:42.967 --> 55:44.604
"Do I know who I'm..."
Do you know who you're messing

55:44.639 --> 55:45.770
-with, buddy?
-You tryin' to screw me over,

55:45.805 --> 55:46.969
-Rick?
-You in my town now, buddy!

55:47.004 --> 55:47.640
This is my place!

55:47.675 --> 55:48.839
It's my record!

55:48.874 --> 55:50.676
Everything you see here
is mine!

55:50.711 --> 55:52.007
This is my record!

55:56.849 --> 55:58.849
Miss Franklin, Ted,

55:58.884 --> 56:00.917
-welcome.
-Jerry.

56:00.952 --> 56:02.424
Nice to see you. Hello.

56:03.559 --> 56:04.789
I'm Rick Hall.

56:08.894 --> 56:10.960
You don't have any Negro
musicians in this town?

56:11.468 --> 56:12.863
Uh...

56:12.898 --> 56:14.403
-We were just discussing that.
-Not today.

56:14.438 --> 56:15.932
Not today?

56:15.967 --> 56:19.672
There was
a miscommunication, Ted.

56:19.707 --> 56:21.971
Negroes only allowed to pick
cotton in these parts, huh?

56:28.111 --> 56:30.980
Percy Sledge had
that same look on his face

56:31.015 --> 56:32.146
when he first come in here.

56:32.984 --> 56:34.720
And then he heard 'em play

56:34.755 --> 56:38.020
and he was very satisfied
with his record.

56:38.055 --> 56:39.857
I think you will be, too.

56:39.892 --> 56:41.430
-Drink?
-We don't have time

56:41.465 --> 56:42.794
for this right now.

56:46.998 --> 56:48.404
Where can I get
a jacket like that?

56:49.000 --> 56:50.571
You'd have to come to Harlem.

56:51.871 --> 56:53.134
Always wanted to go to Harlem.

56:53.169 --> 56:54.641
Yeah.

57:03.014 --> 57:06.851
You're a no good
heartbreaker

57:06.886 --> 57:08.457
Who's this singin'?

57:08.492 --> 57:09.557
The songwriter.

57:12.628 --> 57:13.693
Sings like a writer.

57:15.224 --> 57:17.026
Rick,
you want drums on this?

57:17.061 --> 57:18.962
Or you just wanna
keep it boring?

57:18.997 --> 57:20.634
I don't know, Roger. You know
any good drummers around here?

57:20.669 --> 57:22.603
Don't, actually.

57:22.638 --> 57:24.231
It's just slow.

57:24.266 --> 57:25.870
-It's just a little slow.
- Little slow, yeah.

57:25.905 --> 57:27.641
All right! Come on, guys!

57:27.676 --> 57:29.643
Hang with me on this.
This is a good song!

57:29.678 --> 57:31.007
It's a great song.

57:31.042 --> 57:32.811
It is what it is.

57:41.921 --> 57:43.921
All right. Let's see
what we can make of it.

57:43.956 --> 57:45.155
Hey, Spooner.

57:45.191 --> 57:47.056
You wanna keep that shuffle
on there or straighten it out?

57:47.696 --> 57:49.091
Let's straighten it out.

57:49.929 --> 57:50.994
Straighten it out.

57:51.667 --> 57:52.534
Straightening out.

57:57.805 --> 57:59.068
Put some fatback on it.

57:59.103 --> 58:01.037
Yeah, like a King Curtis deal?

58:01.072 --> 58:03.644
Yeah...
-

58:09.685 --> 58:11.080
Hey, man, that's groovy.

58:12.985 --> 58:15.249
All right, let's go with that.

58:15.284 --> 58:17.185
-Yeah.
-

58:21.092 --> 58:25.160
heartbreaker

58:26.163 --> 58:30.099
and you're a cheat

58:37.581 --> 58:39.240
do these things...

58:39.275 --> 58:40.978
Okay, let's hold up.

58:41.013 --> 58:42.980
Hold up. It sounds like,

58:43.015 --> 58:45.015
uh, Sunday morning
service in there.

58:45.050 --> 58:46.555
Yeah, I was just about to say,

58:46.590 --> 58:47.853
it's a little
too churchy, guys.

58:47.888 --> 58:49.316
I liked it.

58:49.351 --> 58:51.791
Let's find a different pocket,
all right?

58:52.893 --> 58:54.222
Something with more swing.

58:54.895 --> 58:56.125
Speed it up.

58:56.160 --> 58:57.632
Yeah.

58:57.667 --> 58:59.931
No, don't speed it up.
Follow me.

59:25.354 --> 59:28.124
if I could

59:29.633 --> 59:31.226
Stop. Stop.

59:33.098 --> 59:35.197
It's too busy.

59:35.232 --> 59:36.770
Let the song do the work.

59:36.805 --> 59:37.936
Yeah, stop showing off, guys.

59:37.971 --> 59:39.135
Yeah, boys, if you're trying

59:39.170 --> 59:41.038
to impress me,
it's not working.

59:41.073 --> 59:42.875
Yeah, and more importantly,
it's startin' to piss me off.

59:42.910 --> 59:43.942
Maybe we should do
something closer

59:43.977 --> 59:45.075
to the original arrangement.

59:45.110 --> 59:46.879
Nah.
-No, it's done.

59:49.114 --> 59:50.311
You kept
steppin' on me.

59:50.346 --> 59:51.785
You were
all over the neck.

59:51.820 --> 59:52.753
I couldn't tell
what you were doing.

59:52.788 --> 59:53.886
I'm all over the neck?

59:53.921 --> 59:54.953
Find your lane, Jimmy.

59:54.988 --> 59:56.218
Look who's talkin'.

59:56.253 --> 59:57.857
They could hear
your crash in Texas.

59:57.892 --> 59:59.386
Well, my horn
arrangement's killer.

59:59.421 --> 01:00:00.959
Y'all let me know
when you're ready to hear it.

01:00:00.994 --> 01:00:01.793
You gonna
save the song, Jack?

01:00:01.828 --> 01:00:03.126
As I have on many
an occasion, okay.

01:00:03.161 --> 01:00:03.797
Okay.

01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:06.294
Good job, Jack.
- How about that.

01:00:20.244 --> 01:00:22.651
Spooner's got it!
Spooner's got it!

01:00:22.686 --> 01:00:23.784
Yeah, he does.

01:00:31.255 --> 01:00:34.157
good heartbreaker

01:00:35.699 --> 01:00:38.326
you're a cheat

01:00:43.432 --> 01:00:46.774
these things to me

01:00:58.183 --> 01:00:59.985
-Go on, baby.

01:01:10.734 --> 01:01:14.329
I ain't

01:01:20.271 --> 01:01:24.680
I love you, yeah

01:01:31.315 --> 01:01:33.821
run out of fools

01:01:38.927 --> 01:01:41.026
that you'll never lose

01:01:41.061 --> 01:01:42.291
That is rocking.

01:01:42.326 --> 01:01:44.326
Yeah, it sounds pretty good.

01:01:44.361 --> 01:01:46.262
-I can do better.
-

01:01:46.297 --> 01:01:49.034
It's like the perfect mixture
of gospel, blues...

01:01:49.069 --> 01:01:50.233
And sex.

01:01:51.336 --> 01:01:53.874
Baby, that's some of the best
singin' and playin'

01:01:53.909 --> 01:01:54.776
I've ever heard.

01:01:56.307 --> 01:01:58.340
I want to overdub some
backgrounds on the chorus.

01:01:58.375 --> 01:02:00.276
You know, I was
just thinkin' about that.

01:02:00.311 --> 01:02:01.882
We can bring in
some local talent...

01:02:01.917 --> 01:02:03.312
No, I want to do it.

01:02:03.347 --> 01:02:04.819
Okay, even better.
Save me some money.

01:02:05.184 --> 01:02:06.249
Jerry.

01:02:07.450 --> 01:02:08.757
Let me talk to you
for a moment.

01:02:08.792 --> 01:02:09.384
Okay, okay.

01:02:11.388 --> 01:02:13.157
Had a rocking thing on it.

01:02:13.192 --> 01:02:15.797
Yeah, it did.
-It was rocking.

01:02:15.832 --> 01:02:18.932
The way that I,
I love you

01:02:18.967 --> 01:02:20.967
I wasn't lookin' at nobody.
I was trying to do my work.

01:02:21.002 --> 01:02:23.332
He was looking at you.

01:02:23.367 --> 01:02:25.301
Thought he was gonna get him
some nigga tail.

01:02:25.336 --> 01:02:26.841
Pack the bags.

01:02:26.876 --> 01:02:28.172
It sounded good.

01:02:28.207 --> 01:02:29.371
Real good.

01:02:29.406 --> 01:02:30.944
It was really comin' together,

01:02:30.979 --> 01:02:33.045
and you had to show
your ignorant ass.

01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:34.849
I oughta leave you here

01:02:34.884 --> 01:02:36.818
and let those crackers
have a go at you.

01:02:38.888 --> 01:02:41.119
This was the best
I ever sounded.

01:02:41.154 --> 01:02:42.351
Couldn't you hear that?

01:02:44.421 --> 01:02:46.520
We'll finish this in New York.

01:02:46.555 --> 01:02:48.060
With my musicians.

01:02:48.095 --> 01:02:50.458
Your musicians ain't shit.

01:02:50.493 --> 01:02:52.460
You're not about
to mess this up for me.

01:02:52.495 --> 01:02:53.868
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

01:02:53.903 --> 01:02:54.869
I've waited
too long for this.

01:02:54.904 --> 01:02:56.068
Where the...

01:02:56.103 --> 01:02:57.201
Like hell you are.

01:02:58.304 --> 01:02:59.533
You don't know who you're
fucking with! Come here!

01:03:01.339 --> 01:03:03.240
-Ted, it's Rick Hall. Open up.
-

01:03:07.884 --> 01:03:09.510
This cracker here.

01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:13.349
Evenin'.

01:03:13.384 --> 01:03:14.515
May I come inside?

01:03:14.550 --> 01:03:15.351
No.

01:03:17.058 --> 01:03:19.256
I thought we should talk.

01:03:20.424 --> 01:03:22.996
I got nothin' to say
to your hillbilly ass.

01:03:23.031 --> 01:03:26.901
I wish you wouldn't
call me names.

01:03:26.936 --> 01:03:28.265
Do I call you names?

01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:31.367
And what would you
like to call me, whitey?

01:03:35.142 --> 01:03:37.912
I come here to make peace.

01:03:37.947 --> 01:03:41.047
No, I don't wanna make peace
with you, cracker.

01:03:44.184 --> 01:03:47.383
I come here
to tell you that I fired

01:03:47.418 --> 01:03:49.121
that horn player
who was troublin' you.

01:03:49.156 --> 01:03:51.486
And how'd it feel to take
orders from a nigger?

01:03:55.327 --> 01:03:57.327
You know,

01:03:57.362 --> 01:03:59.835
I don't hate you
'cause you're a...

01:04:01.564 --> 01:04:03.432
a Negro.

01:04:03.467 --> 01:04:07.073
I hate you 'cause
you're a giant asshole.

01:04:07.108 --> 01:04:08.943
Don't you ever step foot

01:04:08.978 --> 01:04:12.144
near my studio again,
all right?

01:04:12.179 --> 01:04:13.442
Miss Franklin,
you are welcome at any...

01:04:13.477 --> 01:04:15.213
Don't you talk
to my wife, cracker!

01:04:15.248 --> 01:04:17.017
Now, you keep pushin' me...

01:04:17.052 --> 01:04:18.414
Yeah, what you gonna do,
redneck?

01:04:18.449 --> 01:04:20.284
-And you keep pushin' me...
-Peckerwood!

01:04:20.319 --> 01:04:22.418
Now, you gonna "redneck" me
one more time,

01:04:22.453 --> 01:04:25.421
and you gonna "whitey" me
one more time,

01:04:25.456 --> 01:04:27.489
-and I'm gonna "nigger" you!
-

01:04:27.524 --> 01:04:29.029
Bitch,
call me a nigger again.

01:04:32.265 --> 01:04:33.902
Call me
a bitch again, huh.

01:04:33.937 --> 01:04:37.169
-You stupid! Ass! Bitch!
-

01:04:37.204 --> 01:04:39.270
-

01:05:09.005 --> 01:05:11.203
You hungry?

01:05:11.238 --> 01:05:12.501
I'm all right.

01:05:20.676 --> 01:05:22.544
Come on now, baby.

01:05:22.579 --> 01:05:24.480
Come on, come on.
Come to Grandma. Come on.

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:31.586
Ree is home!

01:05:38.430 --> 01:05:39.627
That bastard.

01:05:39.662 --> 01:05:41.068
I'm gonna kill him.

01:05:55.216 --> 01:05:56.347
You here for long?

01:05:58.054 --> 01:06:00.087
I'm not sure.

01:06:01.156 --> 01:06:02.221
Hmm.

01:06:08.196 --> 01:06:11.164
when I come home

01:06:13.036 --> 01:06:14.266
-

01:06:17.172 --> 01:06:18.600
Did Aretha Franklin call?

01:06:18.635 --> 01:06:20.008
No.
-No?

01:06:20.043 --> 01:06:21.141
Get it, Momma!

01:06:24.608 --> 01:06:26.542
Call Ted White.

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:30.986
when I come home

01:06:32.253 --> 01:06:33.714
Do that thing, Momma!

01:06:33.749 --> 01:06:35.716
Just start callin' everybody
on that list.

01:06:35.751 --> 01:06:37.487
Give me
more mashed potato.

01:06:41.196 --> 01:06:43.163
-

01:06:44.397 --> 01:06:45.726
Come on,
Mama Franklin!

01:06:45.761 --> 01:06:47.464
-Now, let's see you dance!
-

01:06:47.499 --> 01:06:49.631
- All right! Oop.

01:06:49.666 --> 01:06:52.766
when I come home

01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:57.738
Hello?

01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:01.709
She isn't here.

01:07:02.745 --> 01:07:04.679
And if you touch her
again, I'll...

01:07:06.617 --> 01:07:07.682
Go to hell.

01:07:11.094 --> 01:07:12.225
Okay.

01:07:14.163 --> 01:07:18.198
Respect when I get home

01:07:21.104 --> 01:07:23.203
-Mind if I sing with y'all?
-Me too!

01:07:27.110 --> 01:07:30.177
That's what I need

01:07:33.776 --> 01:07:36.348
Your momma cut her
first record at that store.

01:07:36.383 --> 01:07:37.349
Jesus Be A Fence.

01:07:38.517 --> 01:07:41.353
Folks lined up
around the block to buy it.

01:07:41.388 --> 01:07:43.652
They lined up to buy
your records, too.

01:07:43.687 --> 01:07:45.225
Ha. I'm about
to tell 'em that story now.

01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:47.260
-Momma...
-

01:07:47.295 --> 01:07:49.229
-Ain't that...
-Don't say "ain't."

01:07:51.299 --> 01:07:52.727
But ain't that you singing?

01:07:57.536 --> 01:07:59.437
They... They released that?

01:07:59.472 --> 01:08:00.636
if I could

01:08:00.671 --> 01:08:01.703
All right!

01:08:01.738 --> 01:08:03.342
-

01:08:06.677 --> 01:08:08.578
It's a hit!

01:08:08.613 --> 01:08:10.778
Ree, it sounds wonderful.

01:08:11.616 --> 01:08:13.517
Don't you think so, baby?

01:08:14.487 --> 01:08:16.256
It's amazing, Ree.

01:08:16.291 --> 01:08:18.390
That's my sister!
-It's amazing.

01:08:18.425 --> 01:08:20.656
That's your momma
singing! That's amazing!

01:08:23.694 --> 01:08:24.759
That's your
momma singing!

01:08:29.304 --> 01:08:30.435
Hello?

01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:32.140
Mr. Wexler,

01:08:32.175 --> 01:08:33.702
I'm ready to record.

01:08:33.737 --> 01:08:34.703
Oh.

01:08:35.178 --> 01:08:36.606
Thank God.

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:39.411
I want to record with
the Muscle Shoals band.

01:08:39.446 --> 01:08:41.215
Those boys have soul.

01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:43.712
Yes, they do. They do.

01:08:43.747 --> 01:08:46.417
And I want to provide
the backup singers.

01:08:50.424 --> 01:08:52.523
-

01:08:52.558 --> 01:08:55.691
-

01:09:01.336 --> 01:09:04.270
it's a man's world

01:09:06.209 --> 01:09:09.210
by me

01:09:11.676 --> 01:09:15.183
we're together, baby

01:09:19.651 --> 01:09:23.587
'Cause if you
want a do-right
-

01:09:23.622 --> 01:09:26.359
-

01:09:40.738 --> 01:09:44.344
-
my brother

01:09:52.453 --> 01:09:54.618
Sorry.

01:09:54.653 --> 01:09:56.653
You can't treat me like that.

01:10:00.395 --> 01:10:01.526
I know.

01:10:07.798 --> 01:10:09.633
I got demons too, Ree.

01:10:12.407 --> 01:10:13.637
Can you help me fight mine

01:10:13.672 --> 01:10:15.342
the way I help you
fight yours?

01:10:16.939 --> 01:10:18.477
Please.

01:10:20.415 --> 01:10:21.810
I'm so sorry.

01:10:28.687 --> 01:10:30.621
I will help you, baby.

01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:35.527
I love you so much.

01:10:36.332 --> 01:10:37.892
I love you, too.

01:10:41.304 --> 01:10:46.406
all right with me

01:10:46.441 --> 01:10:49.904
every once in a while

01:10:59.619 --> 01:11:01.421
Ree, we've been talkin'.

01:11:01.456 --> 01:11:03.555
How's Clara doin'?

01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:04.952
-She's fine.
-She's good.

01:11:04.987 --> 01:11:06.822
Is Daddy ever
gonna marry Clara?

01:11:09.497 --> 01:11:10.859
I'm surprised
she's stayed this long.

01:11:10.894 --> 01:11:13.730
Why would she leave?
They're church royalty.

01:11:16.999 --> 01:11:19.670
The same reason
they all leave.

01:11:20.409 --> 01:11:22.343
Same reason Momma left.

01:11:23.643 --> 01:11:25.544
The same reason
you need to leave Ted.

01:11:27.614 --> 01:11:30.384
Ted is nothing like Daddy.

01:11:30.419 --> 01:11:31.616
The way you two go at it?

01:11:31.651 --> 01:11:33.453
Just like Momma and Daddy.

01:11:33.488 --> 01:11:34.982
Momma and Daddy didn't fight.

01:11:38.955 --> 01:11:40.625
Wait...

01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:42.429
You're not joking?

01:11:43.498 --> 01:11:45.762
-Joking about what?
-You don't remember?

01:11:45.797 --> 01:11:48.369
Even I remember,
and I was just three or four.

01:11:48.404 --> 01:11:50.030
Remember what?

01:11:50.065 --> 01:11:51.801
Aretha,

01:11:51.836 --> 01:11:54.034
we used to climb up
on the roof

01:11:54.069 --> 01:11:57.444
and sing as loud as we could
to drown them out.

01:11:58.447 --> 01:12:00.612
How could you forget?

01:12:00.647 --> 01:12:02.449
I still have nightmares
about it.

01:12:04.915 --> 01:12:07.718
Well, I was glad
when Momma finally left.

01:12:33.075 --> 01:12:34.910
Why did you leave?

01:12:36.452 --> 01:12:37.616
You don't remember?

01:12:37.948 --> 01:12:39.420
Remember what?

01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:42.885
Nothing.

01:13:06.482 --> 01:13:07.646
What are you doing?

01:13:08.143 --> 01:13:09.384
Get Erma.

01:13:11.454 --> 01:13:12.816
Sure thing.

01:13:43.145 --> 01:13:48.016
For

01:13:52.022 --> 01:13:53.153
Give me...

01:14:09.039 --> 01:14:10.742
One more time.

01:14:14.044 --> 01:14:15.043
Go a third below, Carolyn.

01:14:16.618 --> 01:14:17.683
Yeah.

01:14:18.818 --> 01:14:19.883
Yes.

01:14:21.051 --> 01:14:22.215
Yeah.

01:14:26.529 --> 01:14:28.188
-

01:14:28.223 --> 01:14:30.091
-

01:14:30.126 --> 01:14:32.060
-

01:14:33.195 --> 01:14:34.568
Oh, Big Mama...

01:14:34.603 --> 01:14:35.734
What the hell?

01:14:36.704 --> 01:14:37.934
It's almost 3:00 a.m.

01:14:39.069 --> 01:14:40.838
We're writin' a hit song.

01:14:40.873 --> 01:14:42.070
It's Otis Redding's song.

01:14:43.843 --> 01:14:46.173
-Just a little bit.
-

01:14:53.556 --> 01:14:54.918
Oh, God.

01:14:54.953 --> 01:14:56.656
You really like it?

01:14:56.691 --> 01:14:57.921
-It's wonderful, Ree.
-It's great.

01:14:58.594 --> 01:14:59.824
You're sure?

01:14:59.859 --> 01:15:01.793
Don't do that.

01:15:01.828 --> 01:15:02.761
Y'all tell me

01:15:02.796 --> 01:15:04.191
-if you don't really like it.
-I like it.

01:15:04.765 --> 01:15:05.962
-I love it.
-We love it, Ree.

01:15:05.997 --> 01:15:07.733
Ree-Ree.

01:15:07.768 --> 01:15:09.933
-Re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re.
-

01:15:09.968 --> 01:15:11.605
-Ree.
-

01:15:14.236 --> 01:15:16.841
-

01:15:19.109 --> 01:15:22.847
Re-re-re-re

01:15:22.882 --> 01:15:24.277
That's really good.

01:15:24.312 --> 01:15:25.949
Just a little bit

01:15:25.984 --> 01:15:27.049
Yeah!

01:15:27.722 --> 01:15:29.216
What a line!

01:15:31.154 --> 01:15:33.627
what it means to me

01:15:39.602 --> 01:15:43.032
All right.
- Here we go. Yeah.

01:15:43.067 --> 01:15:44.968
I need a Harlem bassline,
Tommy.

01:15:45.003 --> 01:15:46.838
-Not Alabama.
-

01:15:46.873 --> 01:15:48.642
Well, I ain't been
to Harlem yet.

01:15:48.677 --> 01:15:50.237
But let's funk it up.

01:15:52.681 --> 01:15:54.978
That's nice.

01:15:55.013 --> 01:15:56.815
-

01:15:58.621 --> 01:16:00.819
That is groovy!

01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:05.087
Come on in, Spooner.
What ya got?

01:16:07.223 --> 01:16:09.190
-Yeah!

01:16:09.225 --> 01:16:10.796
I'm gonna keep it simple.

01:16:10.831 --> 01:16:13.128
Like you always do.

01:16:13.163 --> 01:16:14.932
All right.
- That's groovy.

01:16:14.967 --> 01:16:17.132
I dig that.
-Oh, it's her song now.

01:16:17.805 --> 01:16:19.871
-Otis who?
-

01:16:19.906 --> 01:16:21.873
- Solo? Okay.

01:16:31.819 --> 01:16:33.885
All right!

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:36.118
-

01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:56.171
Baby, I got it

01:16:56.206 --> 01:16:59.845
You know I got it?

01:17:02.014 --> 01:17:04.212
when you come home

01:17:04.247 --> 01:17:06.148
-

01:17:06.183 --> 01:17:07.952
-

01:17:07.987 --> 01:17:11.956
Just a little bit

01:17:11.991 --> 01:17:15.960
while you gone

01:17:15.995 --> 01:17:20.096
'cause I don't wanna

01:17:22.034 --> 01:17:23.935
when you come home

01:17:23.970 --> 01:17:25.871
-

01:17:25.906 --> 01:17:27.741
-

01:17:27.776 --> 01:17:29.204
-

01:17:31.340 --> 01:17:34.374
all of my money

01:17:34.409 --> 01:17:39.687
in return, honey

01:17:39.722 --> 01:17:43.691
when you get home

01:17:45.926 --> 01:17:47.827
When you get home

01:17:47.862 --> 01:17:49.257
-

01:17:52.130 --> 01:17:54.328
-

01:18:09.752 --> 01:18:11.983
-

01:18:12.018 --> 01:18:14.887
So is my money

01:18:16.923 --> 01:18:18.385
to do for me

01:18:20.763 --> 01:18:23.731
Bring it to me

01:18:25.493 --> 01:18:27.163
-

01:18:27.198 --> 01:18:31.167
Find out what it means to me

01:18:31.202 --> 01:18:35.138
Take care, TCB

01:18:35.173 --> 01:18:37.404
sock it to me, sock it to me

01:18:37.439 --> 01:18:39.879
sock it to me, sock it to me

01:18:45.150 --> 01:18:46.952
-

01:18:46.987 --> 01:18:48.723

01:18:57.833 --> 01:19:02.033
Aretha! Aretha! Aretha!

01:19:04.103 --> 01:19:08.039
Aretha! Aretha! Aretha!

01:19:08.074 --> 01:19:10.206
Aretha! Aretha!

01:19:13.948 --> 01:19:17.477
-

01:19:17.512 --> 01:19:21.085
to run you away

01:19:23.023 --> 01:19:25.320
-Smokey!
-

01:19:25.355 --> 01:19:27.927
Nobody is talking
about Motown anymore.

01:19:27.962 --> 01:19:30.930
All they want to talk about
is Aretha Franklin.

01:19:31.295 --> 01:19:32.965
You did it, Ree.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.527
-I did it.
-Yes, you did.

01:19:36.201 --> 01:19:38.806
what I'm gonna do

01:19:44.847 --> 01:19:46.077
What did you wish for?

01:19:46.508 --> 01:19:47.947
More hits.

01:19:50.545 --> 01:19:53.953
Aretha Franklin,
you are the Queen of Soul.

01:19:57.992 --> 01:20:00.058
Why'd you have to do it?

01:20:00.093 --> 01:20:02.896
-

01:20:02.931 --> 01:20:05.492
What is soul music?

01:20:05.527 --> 01:20:06.966
The musician having
the biggest influence

01:20:07.001 --> 01:20:07.967
on this genre

01:20:09.234 --> 01:20:10.530
is Grammy-winning soul singer,
Aretha Franklin.

01:20:13.139 --> 01:20:14.875
From a young age,

01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:18.241
I saw Aretha possess
extraordinary talent.

01:20:18.276 --> 01:20:21.211
Ted is my husband, manager,
and favorite critic.

01:20:21.609 --> 01:20:23.378
Hello, Ted.

01:20:23.413 --> 01:20:25.512
Right now, gospel is
the main influence

01:20:25.547 --> 01:20:27.580
on contemporary
rhythm and blues,

01:20:27.615 --> 01:20:30.583
and that's due to Aretha.
Others have mixed

01:20:30.618 --> 01:20:33.861
gospel and so-called
secular music before her,

01:20:33.896 --> 01:20:35.423
but Aretha puts
a unique spin on it

01:20:35.458 --> 01:20:37.865
that people can relate to.

01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:40.329
It's always great
when families sing together

01:20:40.364 --> 01:20:43.134
because there's a language
between siblings

01:20:43.169 --> 01:20:46.874
that you can't recreate
with just hired hands.

01:20:46.909 --> 01:20:51.142
Ain't No Way is a song
written by Carolyn for Aretha,

01:20:51.177 --> 01:20:54.442
and something Aretha
can relate to because,

01:20:54.477 --> 01:20:57.016
I think, they know
each other so well.

01:20:57.051 --> 01:20:59.414
Show me how the melody
goes in the verse.

01:21:14.662 --> 01:21:16.035
That's it.

01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:17.432
Let me try.

01:21:45.495 --> 01:21:49.464
all you need

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:55.976
give all of me

01:22:11.290 --> 01:22:15.589
it was planned

01:22:18.726 --> 01:22:21.034
-

01:22:25.667 --> 01:22:29.207
all the things I can

01:22:45.159 --> 01:22:47.995
Yeah

01:23:20.788 --> 01:23:25.527
someone you're not

01:23:35.077 --> 01:23:38.276
for what he got?

01:23:40.511 --> 01:23:45.613
like you say

01:23:48.387 --> 01:23:52.752
Please, please

01:23:52.787 --> 01:23:57.394
that I need you?

01:24:19.781 --> 01:24:21.781
So it fades right here?

01:24:21.816 --> 01:24:23.783
You genius you.

01:24:27.162 --> 01:24:29.228
You really feelin' this one,
aren't you, Ree?

01:24:29.263 --> 01:24:31.362
-I love it.
-

01:24:32.530 --> 01:24:33.727
I can tell.

01:24:34.664 --> 01:24:38.567
See, so, she's just
being completely honest

01:24:39.537 --> 01:24:41.669
in a song about
what she feels

01:24:41.704 --> 01:24:43.770
at any given moment.

01:24:43.805 --> 01:24:45.409
And that's why
the audience relates to her.

01:24:46.610 --> 01:24:49.578
I'm still trying
to figure out who I am.

01:24:49.613 --> 01:24:51.547
I'm not sure yet,

01:24:51.582 --> 01:24:53.615
but I'm trying
to find the answer.

01:25:02.428 --> 01:25:07.266
Now, I am here
to honor Aretha.

01:25:08.566 --> 01:25:12.205
Or Ree, as I like
to call her...

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:15.505
...for her tireless work
for the Civil Rights Movement.

01:25:16.607 --> 01:25:18.409
Every time

01:25:18.444 --> 01:25:22.545
I ask Aretha to sing
at a fundraiser,

01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:25.548
church event, or a conference,

01:25:25.583 --> 01:25:26.681
she shows up.

01:25:28.487 --> 01:25:31.818
No matter where she is
or what she's doing,

01:25:31.853 --> 01:25:34.689
-she always answers the call.
-

01:25:34.724 --> 01:25:38.363
And I am honored
to present Aretha

01:25:38.398 --> 01:25:41.465
with this proclamation today.

01:25:46.769 --> 01:25:50.309
And I wish that every day

01:25:50.344 --> 01:25:52.674
was Aretha Franklin Day!

01:25:53.743 --> 01:25:56.249
We love you, Aretha!

01:25:56.284 --> 01:25:57.316
After all of that,

01:25:58.419 --> 01:26:00.352
there's really only one thing
left to say, right?

01:26:13.235 --> 01:26:17.171
on the mornin' rain

01:26:19.274 --> 01:26:23.441
so uninspired

01:26:24.807 --> 01:26:27.544
-

01:26:31.814 --> 01:26:35.222
so tired

01:26:44.299 --> 01:26:47.861
to my peace of mind

01:26:51.933 --> 01:26:54.736
-

01:27:04.847 --> 01:27:08.255
what you've done to me

01:27:10.952 --> 01:27:15.328
so good inside

01:27:23.404 --> 01:27:27.769
You make me feel so alive

01:27:33.645 --> 01:27:36.283
Excuse me, Miss Franklin.

01:27:36.318 --> 01:27:37.317
I'm so sorry to bother you,

01:27:37.353 --> 01:27:38.813
-but I just have to tell you.
-It's all right.

01:27:38.848 --> 01:27:39.747
When you sing,

01:27:41.081 --> 01:27:42.949
I feel like you are
talking about my life.

01:27:42.984 --> 01:27:45.985
It helps me,
because it is hard out here.

01:27:46.020 --> 01:27:47.954
But I feel like
you understand,

01:27:47.989 --> 01:27:50.660
and, well, I just
have to thank you.

01:27:51.729 --> 01:27:53.267
Stay strong.

01:27:54.732 --> 01:27:56.303
Okay.

01:27:56.338 --> 01:27:58.437
Yes, thank you.
Thank you very much.

01:27:58.472 --> 01:27:59.605
We have to go now.

01:28:03.477 --> 01:28:06.940
I'm flying to Atlanta tomorrow
to do a benefit for SNCC.

01:28:10.484 --> 01:28:11.945
Cancel it.

01:28:13.421 --> 01:28:15.751
I have some meetings
and interviews lined up.

01:28:16.083 --> 01:28:17.522
No.

01:28:17.557 --> 01:28:19.887
Daddy and Martin
asked me to do it.

01:28:19.922 --> 01:28:21.823
-I'm going.
-

01:28:38.512 --> 01:28:39.676
Aretha!

01:28:39.711 --> 01:28:41.381
Jerry.

01:28:41.416 --> 01:28:42.745
Oh, I love
when you call me Jerry.

01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:43.878
It means you're not mad at me.

01:28:43.913 --> 01:28:45.011
Hello, Ted.

01:28:45.046 --> 01:28:46.518
Jerry.

01:28:46.553 --> 01:28:48.047
Come on in.

01:28:48.082 --> 01:28:50.753
Everyone wants you,
Miss Franklin.

01:28:50.788 --> 01:28:53.426
We've got interest in France,
England, Germany...

01:28:53.461 --> 01:28:54.823
All right, we don't
have to name every country.

01:28:54.858 --> 01:28:56.660
All of Europe.

01:28:56.695 --> 01:28:58.090
The entire continent wants you

01:28:58.125 --> 01:28:59.696
and I think we should
schedule something.

01:28:59.731 --> 01:29:00.928
We should schedule a tour

01:29:00.963 --> 01:29:02.534
that coincides
with the new album.

01:29:02.569 --> 01:29:04.063
We could do that
or we could send her out now

01:29:04.098 --> 01:29:05.669
to create an appetite
for the new record.

01:29:05.704 --> 01:29:07.066
I think that's best.

01:29:07.101 --> 01:29:08.573
I have six venues
ready to clear this...

01:29:08.608 --> 01:29:09.376
And who are you,

01:29:10.412 --> 01:29:12.005
brother?

01:29:13.976 --> 01:29:17.417
Ken Cunningham.
I'm the tour manager.

01:29:18.585 --> 01:29:20.585
Tour manager?

01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:21.520
So, you already
booked the tour?

01:29:21.555 --> 01:29:22.917
It's not booked.

01:29:22.952 --> 01:29:24.754
No, he said
the venues was ready.

01:29:24.789 --> 01:29:26.151
That's right. They were
available if we want 'em.

01:29:26.186 --> 01:29:27.856
You have to gauge
interest early for it.

01:29:27.891 --> 01:29:29.429
-I know how a tour works.
- Okay.

01:29:29.464 --> 01:29:31.563
-No.
-No what?

01:29:31.598 --> 01:29:33.059
No European tour dates.

01:29:33.094 --> 01:29:34.093
Why not?

01:29:34.128 --> 01:29:35.864
Because

01:29:35.899 --> 01:29:37.668
we have some TV dates
we'd like to schedule first.

01:29:37.703 --> 01:29:39.538
Oh, yeah? With whom?

01:29:39.573 --> 01:29:43.410
Carol Burnett, Andy Williams.
Mike Douglas.

01:29:43.445 --> 01:29:45.071
All right. So, those shows
will be there

01:29:45.106 --> 01:29:46.105
when she gets back.

01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:47.678
We have a chance here

01:29:47.713 --> 01:29:49.878
to expand her reach
around the world.

01:29:49.913 --> 01:29:52.078
To make her
a global superstar.

01:29:52.113 --> 01:29:55.114
Do you know what
a rare opportunity that is?

01:29:55.149 --> 01:29:56.885
We're considering
some movie offers as well.

01:29:56.920 --> 01:29:58.117
Movies?

01:29:58.152 --> 01:29:59.954
Aretha. You wanna do movies?

01:30:01.188 --> 01:30:02.594
I think I could.

01:30:02.629 --> 01:30:04.431
Of course you could.

01:30:04.466 --> 01:30:06.059
You could do
any damn thing you want.

01:30:07.997 --> 01:30:09.832
You thought you could
just bring us in here,

01:30:09.867 --> 01:30:11.735
tell us where to go,
what to do,

01:30:11.770 --> 01:30:13.099
and send us on our way?

01:30:13.134 --> 01:30:14.540
You should know by now, Jerry,

01:30:14.575 --> 01:30:16.476
that is not the way
I do business.

01:30:16.511 --> 01:30:19.875
Ken, how much money
could Aretha make on the tour?

01:30:19.910 --> 01:30:21.074
Quarter of a million.

01:30:22.913 --> 01:30:24.814
Carol Burnett
payin' that?

01:30:25.553 --> 01:30:28.488
Movies payin' that?

01:30:28.523 --> 01:30:31.854
We'll consider it.
With the right band.

01:30:31.889 --> 01:30:33.757
All right.

01:30:33.792 --> 01:30:35.759
Well, the Muscle Shoals guys
have started their own label.

01:30:35.794 --> 01:30:37.530
King Curtis is ready to go.

01:30:37.565 --> 01:30:39.499
-Curtis is rockin'.
- He's perfect for you.

01:30:39.534 --> 01:30:41.996
Curtis is good, but I've got
some people lined up.

01:30:42.031 --> 01:30:43.129
Really? Five minutes ago,

01:30:43.164 --> 01:30:44.537
you didn't wanna
go on this tour.

01:30:44.572 --> 01:30:45.769
Now, you've got
people lined up?

01:30:46.233 --> 01:30:47.870
Check the tone, Jerry.

01:30:47.905 --> 01:30:50.004
Just take it easy, Ted.

01:30:50.039 --> 01:30:54.074
I'm sorry.
Forgive me for my tone.

01:30:54.109 --> 01:30:56.483
What musicians
do you have lined up, Ted?

01:30:57.046 --> 01:30:59.145
George Davidson.

01:30:59.180 --> 01:31:01.752
Miller Brisker.
Russell Conway.

01:31:01.787 --> 01:31:04.755
All right. You can't have
the premier singer of our time

01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:07.527
touring Europe with a ragtag
bunch of amateurs

01:31:07.562 --> 01:31:10.222
suitable for backing
some third-rate blues singer

01:31:10.257 --> 01:31:12.191
in a bucket of blood
in Loserville, Louisiana.

01:31:12.226 --> 01:31:14.897
I want to use Ted's musicians,
Mr. Wexler.

01:31:14.932 --> 01:31:16.701
"Mr. Wexler"?

01:31:16.736 --> 01:31:19.506
Oh, God. Aretha, please.

01:31:19.541 --> 01:31:20.340
Can we move on

01:31:21.576 --> 01:31:22.806
to the next item
on the agenda, please?

01:31:28.242 --> 01:31:31.012
Whatever you say,
Miss Franklin.

01:31:35.117 --> 01:31:36.919
So, they do
this funny thing in Amsterdam

01:31:36.954 --> 01:31:38.492
when they really
love a performer.

01:31:39.088 --> 01:31:41.055
They pelt them with flowers.

01:31:41.090 --> 01:31:42.727
Pardon me.

01:31:42.762 --> 01:31:44.025
I warned them not
to get too crazy with it,

01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:45.290
but you might
get hit with a few.

01:31:45.325 --> 01:31:46.830
After the show, please.
After the show.

01:31:46.865 --> 01:31:47.798
Right through this door.

01:31:49.703 --> 01:31:51.571
Watch your step.

01:31:51.606 --> 01:31:53.001
-

01:32:15.058 --> 01:32:17.058
in your chain

01:32:22.131 --> 01:32:24.131
but your fool

01:32:33.681 --> 01:32:36.913
-

01:32:50.225 --> 01:32:53.732
you strength

01:32:56.638 --> 01:32:59.606
to leave you alone

01:32:59.641 --> 01:33:01.608
Fix this
or I'll have your job.

01:33:01.643 --> 01:33:03.940
My father said,
"Come on home"

01:33:03.975 --> 01:33:07.273
"Take it easy"

01:33:07.308 --> 01:33:09.649
-

01:33:15.052 --> 01:33:16.920
Aretha! Aretha!

01:33:20.959 --> 01:33:23.762
Can you comment on the recent
Time magazine cover story?

01:33:24.391 --> 01:33:26.160
Oh, I haven't read it yet,

01:33:26.195 --> 01:33:28.030
but it is a great honor
to grace the cover

01:33:28.065 --> 01:33:29.900
of such
a prestigious magazine.

01:33:32.674 --> 01:33:34.905
This Time article
says that your husband

01:33:34.940 --> 01:33:36.709
beat you in a hotel lobby.

01:33:36.744 --> 01:33:37.303
Excuse me?

01:33:43.410 --> 01:33:45.047
Is this true?

01:33:45.082 --> 01:33:47.049
No more questions!
Let's go!

01:33:47.084 --> 01:33:48.952
-Move.

01:33:52.386 --> 01:33:53.693
It's a lie!

01:33:54.828 --> 01:33:56.795
It's a dirty lie!

01:33:56.830 --> 01:33:58.159
Get off! Come here!

01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:02.834
No, that's too low.
I want $10 million.

01:34:08.743 --> 01:34:11.040
They're gonna be sorry
they wrote this shit.

01:34:11.779 --> 01:34:13.042
And you know, your daddy,

01:34:13.077 --> 01:34:15.209
he doesn't come across
too well either.

01:34:15.244 --> 01:34:16.815
He may wanna sue 'em
his damn self.

01:34:16.850 --> 01:34:18.179
How are you gonna prove
that you didn't hit me?

01:34:20.018 --> 01:34:22.183
You did and everyone saw it!

01:34:24.187 --> 01:34:26.990
Another man would
have killed you by now.

01:34:27.025 --> 01:34:28.728
Crazy way you act.

01:34:30.996 --> 01:34:32.259
Get out of my way.

01:34:32.294 --> 01:34:33.964
What are you gonna do, huh?
What are you gonna do?

01:34:33.999 --> 01:34:34.899
I mean it.

01:34:36.771 --> 01:34:38.133
You would still be singing

01:34:38.168 --> 01:34:39.673
some Al Jolson shit
if it wasn't for me.

01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:42.676
-I wrote half your hits.
-

01:34:44.009 --> 01:34:45.437
Are you laughing at me?

01:34:45.472 --> 01:34:47.208
You know damn well
you didn't write one word.

01:34:47.914 --> 01:34:49.782
One note of anything.

01:34:49.817 --> 01:34:51.278
I just let you put
your name on it

01:34:51.313 --> 01:34:52.851
to keep you
from throwing a fit.

01:34:52.886 --> 01:34:54.919
I Never Loved A Man
came from me.

01:34:54.954 --> 01:34:56.723
My songwriter!

01:34:56.758 --> 01:34:59.726
That song wasn't anything
until I rearranged it.

01:34:59.761 --> 01:35:02.388
And I sang the hell out of it
because it was about you.

01:35:02.423 --> 01:35:05.424
You're a lying, no good,

01:35:05.459 --> 01:35:08.801
just useless, psychopath.

01:35:08.836 --> 01:35:10.968
-No!

01:35:15.810 --> 01:35:17.304
I'm done with you.

01:35:19.473 --> 01:35:22.210
Yeah, you've said that before.

01:35:22.245 --> 01:35:23.915
You wait until
your demons come back!

01:35:25.314 --> 01:35:27.116
After livin' with you,

01:35:28.218 --> 01:35:30.053
I'm ready for 'em.

01:36:02.219 --> 01:36:05.121
This song goes out

01:36:05.156 --> 01:36:09.290
to anyone who has
ever felt mistreated.

01:36:11.965 --> 01:36:13.833
Two, three, four.

01:36:13.868 --> 01:36:15.934
-

01:36:21.106 --> 01:36:22.974
-

01:36:23.009 --> 01:36:25.141
you're trying to do to me

01:36:25.176 --> 01:36:26.945
-

01:36:26.980 --> 01:36:29.409
Let yourself be free

01:36:29.444 --> 01:36:31.147
let's go back

01:36:31.182 --> 01:36:33.347
way back when

01:36:34.988 --> 01:36:36.251
too much more than 10

01:36:38.321 --> 01:36:41.157
I ain't no doctor with degree

01:36:41.192 --> 01:36:43.489
too much high IQ

01:36:43.524 --> 01:36:45.326
you're doing to me

01:36:45.361 --> 01:36:47.229
-

01:36:47.264 --> 01:36:49.099
you're trying to do to me

01:36:49.134 --> 01:36:50.870
-

01:36:50.905 --> 01:36:52.938
let yourself be free

01:36:52.973 --> 01:36:55.303
-

01:36:55.338 --> 01:36:57.272
-

01:37:19.065 --> 01:37:22.561
You, think about it

01:37:22.596 --> 01:37:24.299
you could ask

01:37:24.334 --> 01:37:25.366
with I won't

01:37:27.205 --> 01:37:28.974
but I'm not

01:37:29.009 --> 01:37:30.602
doing things I don't

01:37:30.637 --> 01:37:32.505
-

01:37:32.540 --> 01:37:34.276
you're trying to do to me

01:37:34.311 --> 01:37:36.047
-

01:37:36.082 --> 01:37:37.917
let yourself be free

01:37:37.952 --> 01:37:40.117
-

01:37:40.152 --> 01:37:42.449
-

01:37:42.484 --> 01:37:46.585
There ain't nothing we can do

01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:48.554
Think about it right now

01:37:50.261 --> 01:37:52.195
-

01:37:58.467 --> 01:38:00.401
-

01:38:49.287 --> 01:38:50.451
Thank you.

01:39:16.281 --> 01:39:18.578
I have some trash
I need taken downstairs.

01:39:19.284 --> 01:39:22.120
Right now, please.

01:39:42.175 --> 01:39:43.636
Just come over.

01:39:45.607 --> 01:39:47.310
I know.

01:39:49.578 --> 01:39:51.380
I don't care.

01:39:53.450 --> 01:39:54.647
Just...

01:39:55.749 --> 01:39:57.419
be with me.

01:40:33.391 --> 01:40:35.292
You sure
that ain't too much, Ree?

01:40:35.327 --> 01:40:38.493
Listen, you're about
to have the meal of your life.

01:40:38.528 --> 01:40:39.758
She put
her foot in there. Smell it.

01:40:39.793 --> 01:40:41.595
Yes, I did,
yes, I did.

01:40:41.630 --> 01:40:43.201
-She put somethin' in there.
-Put her foot in, she did.

01:40:43.236 --> 01:40:44.565
I don't know.
That smells funny.

01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:45.833
-Darlin', get outta there.

01:40:45.868 --> 01:40:47.370
-You want me to get that, Ree?
- Yes, answer. Get...

01:40:47.405 --> 01:40:48.173
Get outta here!

01:40:50.309 --> 01:40:50.802
All right, put it back.

01:40:50.837 --> 01:40:51.704
Hello?

01:40:52.575 --> 01:40:54.773
And that's me.

01:40:54.808 --> 01:40:57.743
This will bring Big Mama
to her knees, honey.

01:40:57.778 --> 01:40:59.118
You goin' to Hell
for that.

01:40:59.153 --> 01:40:59.745
Hey.

01:41:01.254 --> 01:41:02.649
She knows.

01:41:04.191 --> 01:41:05.586
No, no, no.

01:41:07.557 --> 01:41:09.326
-No, no, no.
- What's wrong?

01:41:10.692 --> 01:41:11.592
What's wrong?

01:41:16.698 --> 01:41:17.598
Hello?

01:41:18.568 --> 01:41:20.205
What is it?

01:41:21.538 --> 01:41:22.603
What?

01:41:25.839 --> 01:41:27.740
-What?
-It's Martin.

01:41:28.545 --> 01:41:30.281
They...

01:41:30.316 --> 01:41:32.778
Oh, God.
- They shot him.

01:41:32.813 --> 01:41:35.154
Oh, God.

01:41:35.189 --> 01:41:38.388
I wanna
say it one more time

01:43:41.546 --> 01:43:43.942
He kept telling me

01:43:43.977 --> 01:43:45.746
that they were gonna get him.

01:43:47.585 --> 01:43:52.258
But I said, "Martin, the Lord
has more for you to do.

01:43:52.854 --> 01:43:55.360
You're gonna be all right."

01:43:57.463 --> 01:43:58.660
But he knew.

01:43:59.762 --> 01:44:01.498
He knew.

01:44:02.765 --> 01:44:05.337
Other ministers
were jealous of him,

01:44:06.307 --> 01:44:07.900
-but I never was.
-Mm.

01:44:08.507 --> 01:44:10.474
He was my friend.

01:44:11.576 --> 01:44:13.609
-I ministered him...
-Yeah.

01:44:13.644 --> 01:44:14.775
...advised him.

01:44:15.613 --> 01:44:16.975
Prayed with him.

01:44:18.319 --> 01:44:20.781
-Yes, you did.
-More time than I can count.

01:44:23.588 --> 01:44:25.324
I loved him, Ree.

01:44:25.359 --> 01:44:26.919
He loved you.

01:44:31.596 --> 01:44:33.794
Who's gonna lead us now?

01:44:35.732 --> 01:44:37.864
They don't listen
to me anymore.

01:44:37.899 --> 01:44:40.834
You still have
the biggest church in Detroit.

01:44:42.002 --> 01:44:43.804
I still know
how to get 'em goin'.

01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:45.839
-Yes, you do.
-I do.

01:44:45.874 --> 01:44:47.709
Can I join you?

01:44:47.744 --> 01:44:50.316
No. I just wanna talk to Ree.
Can I do that?

01:44:50.351 --> 01:44:51.845
-Can I just talk to Ree?
-Of course you can.

01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:53.352
-Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.
-Of course you can.

01:44:54.487 --> 01:44:57.323
Um, I'll be right there
when you need me.

01:44:59.657 --> 01:45:01.426
They need leadership, Ree.

01:45:03.562 --> 01:45:05.056
You should see
the way these fools

01:45:05.091 --> 01:45:08.631
are steppin' over
Martin's body to be in charge.

01:45:08.666 --> 01:45:10.666
I don't want no part of that.

01:45:11.900 --> 01:45:15.902
And these young
revolutionaries out here,

01:45:15.937 --> 01:45:17.475
they don't want
no part of what we built.

01:45:18.775 --> 01:45:21.479
They want to free our people.

01:45:21.514 --> 01:45:23.481
They all talk.

01:45:23.516 --> 01:45:25.846
Not all of them.
I like Angela Davis.

01:45:27.817 --> 01:45:30.389
She don't care
about public opinion

01:45:30.424 --> 01:45:32.017
and she's not afraid
to speak up

01:45:32.052 --> 01:45:34.525
to those pigs or anyone else.

01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:37.825
-Pigs?
-Yes, pigs.

01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:39.398
You saw what they did to us
during the rebellion.

01:45:39.433 --> 01:45:40.597
Riots.

01:45:41.534 --> 01:45:43.666
Why shouldn't we fight back?

01:45:43.701 --> 01:45:46.438
And start a full-on war?
You think we can win that?

01:45:46.473 --> 01:45:47.901
We're tired of gettin'
our heads kicked in.

01:45:47.936 --> 01:45:51.443
Non-violence
got us our civil rights

01:45:51.478 --> 01:45:53.544
and our right to vote.

01:45:53.579 --> 01:45:54.974
At what price? Our souls?

01:45:55.009 --> 01:45:56.349
Our dignity?

01:45:57.110 --> 01:45:58.384
Hmm.

01:46:01.620 --> 01:46:03.356
I've been thinking.

01:46:05.756 --> 01:46:07.690
We should hit the road again.

01:46:10.123 --> 01:46:11.661
Why not?

01:46:11.696 --> 01:46:13.531
A northern tour.

01:46:13.566 --> 01:46:16.600
Me preachin' and you singin'.

01:46:16.635 --> 01:46:17.568
Mm-mmm.

01:46:19.506 --> 01:46:22.936
Just think on it.

01:46:22.971 --> 01:46:24.608
You don't gotta
decide tonight.

01:46:24.643 --> 01:46:25.906
I'm not doing that, Daddy.

01:46:27.580 --> 01:46:29.613
I know you got
your very busy tourin'

01:46:29.648 --> 01:46:30.944
and recordin' schedule.

01:46:30.979 --> 01:46:32.451
This won't interfere
with that.

01:46:32.486 --> 01:46:34.046
-I won't interfere with that.
-No.

01:46:35.654 --> 01:46:38.589
I'm done with that.

01:46:38.624 --> 01:46:40.591
I can't go back
to headlining with you.

01:46:46.995 --> 01:46:49.798
You're not walkin'
in the spirit anymore.

01:46:51.604 --> 01:46:54.132
That is not true.

01:46:54.167 --> 01:46:57.102
You're drinking
and you're whoring around.

01:46:57.137 --> 01:46:58.609
Same as you!

01:46:58.644 --> 01:47:00.446
You not too old for me
to knock you on your ass!

01:47:00.481 --> 01:47:01.942
-You know that, right?
-Is everything all right?

01:47:01.977 --> 01:47:04.450
Just mind your own business!
I'm talkin' to...

01:47:04.485 --> 01:47:05.781
Don't talk to her like that.

01:47:05.816 --> 01:47:08.047
Have you lost your mind, huh?

01:47:08.082 --> 01:47:09.983
Maybe.

01:47:10.018 --> 01:47:11.952
Maybe I found it.

01:47:15.221 --> 01:47:16.726
Come on, let's get you to bed.

01:47:16.761 --> 01:47:18.464
Just...

01:47:18.499 --> 01:47:20.092
Just don't.

01:47:31.776 --> 01:47:34.612
-I heard your conversation.
-Mm...

01:47:34.647 --> 01:47:36.108
I'm not sorry.

01:47:36.143 --> 01:47:38.044
No, no, you ain't got nothin'
to be sorry for.

01:47:39.718 --> 01:47:41.652
Just do your thing, Ree.

01:47:42.589 --> 01:47:47.152
And you do it
as big and as loud

01:47:47.187 --> 01:47:48.989
and as long as you can.

01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:23.254
la, la, la, la,

01:48:23.289 --> 01:48:27.797
la, la, la, la

01:48:27.832 --> 01:48:33.099
at Spanish Harlem

01:48:33.134 --> 01:48:36.069
Please, just listen
to it again, okay?

01:48:36.104 --> 01:48:38.203
I have a great feeling
about this song,

01:48:38.238 --> 01:48:40.205
and The Beatles
are getting restless.

01:48:40.240 --> 01:48:42.614
They said if you
don't do it, they will.

01:48:42.649 --> 01:48:44.616
The song is Catholic, Jerry.

01:48:44.651 --> 01:48:46.211
I'm a Baptist.

01:48:46.246 --> 01:48:48.048
That's... That's crazy.

01:48:48.083 --> 01:48:49.313
-You thought that's gonna...
-They caught Angela Davis.

01:48:49.348 --> 01:48:51.084
-What?
- That can't be right.

01:48:51.119 --> 01:48:52.954
No, no, no, no.

01:48:52.989 --> 01:48:55.561
Angela Davis,
a young Black militant

01:48:55.596 --> 01:48:57.222
who has been hunted
for nearly two months

01:48:57.257 --> 01:48:58.894
on murder
and kidnapping charges,

01:49:00.667 --> 01:49:02.700
was arrested yesterday at a
hotel in midtown Manhattan

01:49:02.735 --> 01:49:05.230
by agents of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

01:49:05.265 --> 01:49:07.573
-

01:49:07.608 --> 01:49:09.971
Angela Davis
must go free.

01:49:10.006 --> 01:49:12.743
Black people will be free.

01:49:12.778 --> 01:49:15.042
My daddy says
I don't know what I'm doing.

01:49:15.077 --> 01:49:17.176
I respect him, of course,

01:49:17.211 --> 01:49:20.146
but I have to stick
by my beliefs.

01:49:20.181 --> 01:49:24.557
You have to disturb the peace
when you can't get no peace.

01:49:30.829 --> 01:49:32.796
What the hell
is this tour schedule?

01:49:32.831 --> 01:49:34.930
-Half the damn dates are gone!
-All right, all right,

01:49:34.965 --> 01:49:36.635
we were just about to have
a talk with you about this.

01:49:36.670 --> 01:49:37.999
We?

01:49:38.034 --> 01:49:39.572
We're not having
a family barbecue?

01:49:40.674 --> 01:49:42.003
This is one of these
Ken hippie talks?

01:49:42.038 --> 01:49:43.675
I told you this wasn't
gonna work.

01:49:43.710 --> 01:49:44.775
Just breathe.

01:49:44.810 --> 01:49:46.007
Put the damn dates back.

01:49:46.042 --> 01:49:46.942
Don't do it, Cecil.
Listen, Ree...

01:49:46.977 --> 01:49:48.009
You work for me, Cecil.

01:49:48.044 --> 01:49:49.373
You overbook.

01:49:49.408 --> 01:49:51.177
You don't show up
for half the dates,

01:49:51.212 --> 01:49:52.277
then I have to
deal with the fallout.

01:49:52.312 --> 01:49:53.817
It's your damn job!

01:49:53.852 --> 01:49:54.917
We're trying to help you.

01:49:54.952 --> 01:49:56.721
Aretha, you need to slow down.

01:49:56.756 --> 01:49:58.624
You stop for five minutes,
they forget all about you.

01:49:58.659 --> 01:49:59.757
That's ridiculous.

01:50:00.860 --> 01:50:02.287
How would you know, Erma?
You barely have one hit.

01:50:02.322 --> 01:50:03.959
Ree,
you haven't slept in months.

01:50:03.994 --> 01:50:05.862
And you look like it.

01:50:05.897 --> 01:50:07.765
You don't want me to tell you
what you look like, Carolyn.

01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:09.063
Well, next time
you have a breakdown,

01:50:10.099 --> 01:50:11.296
don't call us, all right?

01:50:14.334 --> 01:50:15.608
I won't.

01:50:16.677 --> 01:50:18.204
Come on,
let's go outside. Come on.

01:50:18.239 --> 01:50:20.712
And don't call me
when you need a gig,

01:50:20.747 --> 01:50:25.112
or you want me to write liner
notes in your jive-ass album,

01:50:25.147 --> 01:50:27.378
or introduce you
to some producers,

01:50:27.413 --> 01:50:31.085
or just borrow some cash
that your ass never pay back.

01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:33.318
If I don't work,
y'all don't eat.

01:50:34.387 --> 01:50:36.255
Right.

01:50:36.290 --> 01:50:37.927
Put the damn dates
back, Cecil.

01:50:40.261 --> 01:50:45.363
Three venues in three states
in three days.

01:50:45.398 --> 01:50:48.201
-Happy now?
-Yes, I am.

01:50:48.236 --> 01:50:50.676
And don't ever pull that
bullshit with me again.

01:50:50.711 --> 01:50:52.172
I know how to run
my damn business.

01:50:53.043 --> 01:50:55.340
You asked me.

01:50:55.375 --> 01:50:56.880
Y'all just wanna
take my crown.

01:50:56.915 --> 01:50:59.080
-Oh, God.
-Please.

01:50:59.115 --> 01:51:02.215
Ree, think about our son.
This isn't good for him.

01:51:02.250 --> 01:51:04.085
Don't tell me
I'm a bad mother.

01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:05.691
-Here comes the paranoia.
- I never said that!

01:51:05.726 --> 01:51:07.891
Olga, bring Miss Franklin
a fruit juice.

01:51:07.926 --> 01:51:09.321
Don't you dare.

01:51:11.127 --> 01:51:13.996
What you staring at?
Go get my lunch.

01:51:14.031 --> 01:51:15.195
Yes, ma'am.

01:51:17.265 --> 01:51:19.133
Tell me y'all
don't want what I got.

01:51:19.168 --> 01:51:20.871
All right, forget it!

01:51:20.906 --> 01:51:22.334
I can't talk to you
when that demon takes hold.

01:51:24.008 --> 01:51:25.876
You don't know
what I go through.

01:51:25.911 --> 01:51:27.911
Y'all don't know
what I've been through!

01:51:27.946 --> 01:51:29.011
We love you, Ree.

01:51:29.046 --> 01:51:31.013
Why can't you see that, Ree?

01:51:31.048 --> 01:51:33.114
Get the hell out of my house.

01:51:33.149 --> 01:51:34.852
No, don't move. We're going
to deal with this, Ree.

01:51:34.887 --> 01:51:36.084
Out!

01:51:37.417 --> 01:51:38.691
Out!

01:51:40.321 --> 01:51:41.353
Out!

01:51:45.029 --> 01:51:46.292
-Come on, baby, please.
-Mm-mm.

01:51:49.165 --> 01:51:52.166
Ree, listen to me.
They're here to help you.

01:51:52.201 --> 01:51:54.366
- Please.

01:51:57.943 --> 01:51:59.404
It's your family.

01:51:59.439 --> 01:52:02.275
Teddy! Calf! Come help
your momma sing now.

01:52:07.788 --> 01:52:11.218
and Black

01:52:11.253 --> 01:52:15.123
precious thing

01:52:16.324 --> 01:52:19.765
Young,
gifted, and Black

01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:23.967
precious thing

01:52:24.002 --> 01:52:25.001
Say it again.

01:52:26.235 --> 01:52:28.972
and Black

01:52:29.007 --> 01:52:33.911
to what I mean

01:52:33.946 --> 01:52:37.277
gifted, and Black

01:52:41.217 --> 01:52:44.416
I'm gonna take the kids
back to Detroit with me.

01:52:45.958 --> 01:52:47.925
I think that's best.

01:52:53.295 --> 01:52:54.866
What are you thinking
right now?

01:52:54.901 --> 01:52:56.296
Just things.

01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:03.336
What things?

01:53:03.371 --> 01:53:05.976
Private things.

01:53:06.011 --> 01:53:08.440
After all this time, you're
still keepin' stuff from me?

01:53:10.543 --> 01:53:12.312
You don't keep stuff from me?

01:53:12.512 --> 01:53:13.445
No.

01:53:14.888 --> 01:53:16.085
You should.

01:53:16.120 --> 01:53:18.186
Why? I trust you.

01:53:19.057 --> 01:53:20.320
Don't you trust me?

01:53:21.125 --> 01:53:23.488
Sometimes.

01:53:23.523 --> 01:53:25.325
What do I have to do
to make it all the time?

01:53:25.899 --> 01:53:27.459
Just let me be.

01:53:36.877 --> 01:53:38.338
I know what to do.

01:53:46.084 --> 01:53:47.215
Mmm.

01:53:49.219 --> 01:53:51.186
Be here with me.

01:53:51.221 --> 01:53:53.386
Just let your mind go quiet
for a moment.

01:53:53.421 --> 01:53:55.861
That would be easy
if you stopped talking.

01:54:03.431 --> 01:54:04.496
What's wrong?

01:54:04.905 --> 01:54:06.036
Nothing.

01:54:07.974 --> 01:54:09.303
I have to make some calls.

01:54:09.338 --> 01:54:10.942
You don't have
to call anyone, Ree.

01:54:10.977 --> 01:54:12.273
You don't know
what I have to do.

01:54:12.308 --> 01:54:13.505
Don't go to that dark place.

01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:16.376
Come here.

01:54:18.314 --> 01:54:19.544
Come here.

01:54:25.057 --> 01:54:26.892
Tell me what's wrong, baby.

01:54:33.065 --> 01:54:34.295
You're shaking.

01:54:34.330 --> 01:54:36.066
You act so tough.

01:54:36.101 --> 01:54:38.068
I can see that little
scared girl in you.

01:54:38.103 --> 01:54:39.905
Shit!

01:54:39.940 --> 01:54:42.006
-I'm sorry.

01:54:42.503 --> 01:54:44.206
I'm so sorry.

01:54:48.113 --> 01:54:49.310
It's all right.

01:54:49.345 --> 01:54:50.278
Shit!

01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:02.059
She can't do it, Cecil.

01:55:02.094 --> 01:55:03.555
Put her on the phone.

01:55:05.493 --> 01:55:07.625
She's asleep right now.
Her migraine.

01:55:07.660 --> 01:55:10.001
Man, who do you think
you're bullshittin'?

01:55:10.036 --> 01:55:12.531
Tell Ree she's gonna
get sued again.

01:55:16.504 --> 01:55:18.042
One of us
needs to go check on her.

01:55:18.077 --> 01:55:19.538
Well, it's your job
to keep an eye on her.

01:55:19.573 --> 01:55:20.506
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:55:20.541 --> 01:55:22.640
the Queen of Soul,

01:55:22.675 --> 01:55:25.610
Miss Aretha Franklin!

01:55:25.645 --> 01:55:27.414
- Ree!

01:55:27.449 --> 01:55:29.614
Hey, let us help you.

01:55:29.649 --> 01:55:30.450
Please.

01:55:42.662 --> 01:55:44.101
-

01:55:51.308 --> 01:55:55.112
for you

01:56:02.583 --> 01:56:04.286
-

01:56:11.295 --> 01:56:13.999
to wear now

01:56:15.728 --> 01:56:18.135
-

01:56:18.170 --> 01:56:21.336
You'll stay in my heart

01:56:23.076 --> 01:56:26.275
We never will part

01:56:28.114 --> 01:56:30.081
-

01:56:30.116 --> 01:56:33.480
To live without you

01:56:33.515 --> 01:56:37.319
Only bring
heartbreak for me

01:56:46.462 --> 01:56:48.297
-

01:57:04.678 --> 01:57:06.744
-Ree? Ree?

01:57:06.779 --> 01:57:09.252
Ree? Ree? Can you hear me?

01:57:09.287 --> 01:57:10.748
-Don't move.
- Don't... Don't move.

01:57:10.783 --> 01:57:12.585
-Your arm?
- Someone get a medic!

01:57:12.620 --> 01:57:14.125
Come here, baby,
come here.

01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:15.720
Roll over. Roll over.

01:57:15.755 --> 01:57:17.293
Easy, easy, easy.
-Stay back!

01:57:18.164 --> 01:57:19.526
I got you, I got you.

01:57:19.561 --> 01:57:21.660
Back, please.
Get back, please.

01:57:21.695 --> 01:57:23.233
-Keep back, please!

01:57:23.268 --> 01:57:25.070
Is she okay?

01:57:25.105 --> 01:57:26.170
It's gonna be all right, Ree.

01:57:27.305 --> 01:57:29.239
I can't do this anymore.

01:57:34.642 --> 01:57:35.707
Mm.

01:58:27.563 --> 01:58:28.760
Please...

01:58:29.829 --> 01:58:31.301
Please...

02:00:15.968 --> 02:00:21.279
-

02:00:53.610 --> 02:00:55.643
Our Father...

02:00:59.583 --> 02:01:01.550
-Which art in Heaven...

02:01:04.324 --> 02:01:06.918
Hallowed be Thy name.

02:01:08.526 --> 02:01:10.592
Thy kingdom come.

02:02:22.600 --> 02:02:24.864
You always did know
how to make an entrance.

02:02:28.540 --> 02:02:29.605
James.

02:02:39.485 --> 02:02:40.748
All right.

02:02:42.554 --> 02:02:45.423
Okay. You come and sit.

02:02:45.458 --> 02:02:46.820
Come on.

02:03:00.506 --> 02:03:02.539
What y'all wanna sing?

02:03:02.574 --> 02:03:03.771
And...

02:03:06.479 --> 02:03:09.810
An all-gospel record
has a very limited audience.

02:03:09.845 --> 02:03:11.944
-I don't care.
-You do care.

02:03:11.979 --> 02:03:14.485
You sat in that office
with me six years ago,

02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:15.849
and you said
you wanted to make hits,

02:03:15.884 --> 02:03:17.114
and I think you still do.

02:03:17.149 --> 02:03:19.490
I'm making this album, Jerry.

02:03:19.525 --> 02:03:21.591
All right, can you just
hear me out, please?

02:03:21.626 --> 02:03:23.087
I'm making this album,

02:03:23.122 --> 02:03:26.057
or I'll never make an album
with you again.

02:03:27.764 --> 02:03:30.468
All I wanna do
is drink now, Jerry.

02:03:30.503 --> 02:03:32.437
Well, let me get you
into a program.

02:03:32.472 --> 02:03:34.967
I'm in a program,
but I need the church.

02:03:35.002 --> 02:03:36.441
I need the spirit.

02:03:36.476 --> 02:03:37.508
It has always
gotten me through,

02:03:37.543 --> 02:03:38.608
and it will get me
through again.

02:03:40.810 --> 02:03:42.975
Okay. Well, can we just...

02:03:43.010 --> 02:03:44.779
I... I mean,
just think about this...

02:03:44.814 --> 02:03:47.617
This album is not for me
or for you or anybody else.

02:03:47.652 --> 02:03:49.454
This album is for God.

02:03:49.489 --> 02:03:52.655
And you can't jive God, Jerry,
so stop trying.

02:03:52.690 --> 02:03:54.019
- Oh.

02:03:54.054 --> 02:03:57.825
I'm not trying to jive you
or Jesus, okay?

02:03:59.895 --> 02:04:01.598
It's the gospel record.

02:04:03.503 --> 02:04:06.834
It's 1972, for Christ's sake.
Sorry. I...

02:04:07.507 --> 02:04:08.572
Hey,

02:04:09.905 --> 02:04:12.477
how about we make
a documentary film

02:04:12.512 --> 02:04:13.511
to go along with the record?

02:04:13.546 --> 02:04:14.908
Why?

02:04:14.943 --> 02:04:17.746
So, the international fans,
the hippies,

02:04:17.781 --> 02:04:20.551
the atheists like me
can see you in your element

02:04:20.586 --> 02:04:22.784
and understand the music
that made you.

02:04:22.819 --> 02:04:25.017
You mean for white people?

02:04:25.052 --> 02:04:26.590
Well, I...

02:04:27.692 --> 02:04:28.988
All right. Yes.

02:04:31.223 --> 02:04:32.794
That's a great idea.

02:04:34.127 --> 02:04:36.061
Okay. Well, good.
So, you're not gonna leave me?

02:04:36.800 --> 02:04:38.503
We're not done yet.

02:04:38.538 --> 02:04:41.770
Oh, boy. What?

02:04:41.805 --> 02:04:44.003
I want to produce
the album, too.

02:04:45.105 --> 02:04:46.005
Oh.

02:04:50.275 --> 02:04:53.078
All right. Okay. Okay.

02:05:02.628 --> 02:05:04.529
Hold! Hold!

02:05:04.564 --> 02:05:06.795
You have to do something
with the longer notes.

02:05:06.830 --> 02:05:09.259
You're not giving yourself
anywhere to go.

02:05:09.294 --> 02:05:12.064
Start straight, then hit
the vibrato halfway through.

02:05:12.099 --> 02:05:13.164
Tension
and release, y'all.

02:05:14.233 --> 02:05:17.069
Yes, and this song
is a lot more, uh, deliberate.

02:05:17.104 --> 02:05:18.675
-Mm.
- Yeah?

02:05:19.843 --> 02:05:21.073
Take it from
where we left off.

02:05:21.746 --> 02:05:23.174
"In the stillness."

02:05:33.626 --> 02:05:35.692
Yeah, that's it.

02:05:51.677 --> 02:05:55.712
-

02:05:55.747 --> 02:05:58.847
-

02:05:58.882 --> 02:06:01.586
-

02:06:01.621 --> 02:06:02.752
Thank you!

02:06:06.285 --> 02:06:10.595
-

02:06:34.313 --> 02:06:39.118
Sweet precious memories

02:07:04.343 --> 02:07:07.883
Oh, Lord

02:07:16.091 --> 02:07:18.960
Okay, all right,
we're gonna take a ten.

02:07:18.995 --> 02:07:21.226
Let's take ten. Let's, uh...

02:07:30.776 --> 02:07:32.204
Are you all right?

02:07:32.239 --> 02:07:35.273
I can't make a fool
out of myself.

02:07:35.308 --> 02:07:37.242
There's gonna be
a film crew here.

02:07:39.983 --> 02:07:42.687
And if I break down
like I did right now,

02:07:42.722 --> 02:07:44.282
they gonna think
I lost my mind.

02:07:44.317 --> 02:07:45.822
Ree...

02:07:47.991 --> 02:07:51.091
Ree, the spirit is the spirit.

02:07:51.126 --> 02:07:52.862
It moves when it moves.

02:07:52.897 --> 02:07:55.194
What you want us to do?
Behave like Episcopalians?

02:07:57.770 --> 02:07:59.198
Now what's really
bothering you?

02:08:01.807 --> 02:08:03.675
You told me once

02:08:05.140 --> 02:08:08.141
that music would save my life.

02:08:09.408 --> 02:08:10.682
I did.

02:08:11.146 --> 02:08:12.981
What if it doesn't?

02:08:14.149 --> 02:08:16.248
The demon is strong.

02:08:16.283 --> 02:08:18.756
Ain't no demon
hauntin' you, Ree.

02:08:18.791 --> 02:08:20.021
There never was.

02:08:21.224 --> 02:08:24.696
Just the pain you've been
runnin' from your whole life.

02:08:26.766 --> 02:08:29.096
But you gotta let it go, Ree.

02:08:30.902 --> 02:08:32.869
Give it to God.

02:08:35.038 --> 02:08:36.103
It wasn't your fault.

02:08:39.042 --> 02:08:40.976
And He knows that.

02:08:44.377 --> 02:08:47.312
I don't know about tomorrow

02:08:47.347 --> 02:08:51.250
or the concert or the album
or the documentary.

02:08:52.319 --> 02:08:54.858
You in church right now.

02:08:55.960 --> 02:08:57.795
You're safe.

02:08:59.062 --> 02:09:00.963
So, Ree,

02:09:01.801 --> 02:09:03.735
let's have church.

02:09:53.149 --> 02:09:54.214
Daddy.

02:09:57.120 --> 02:09:58.218
It's good to see you.

02:10:00.288 --> 02:10:03.421
We were in California, and

02:10:03.456 --> 02:10:05.456
we heard that you were
singing gospel, and...

02:10:07.526 --> 02:10:09.295
Clara dragged me here.

02:10:09.330 --> 02:10:11.836
Clara can't make
you do anything.

02:10:11.871 --> 02:10:13.365
She's got pretty feisty
since you last saw her.

02:10:14.566 --> 02:10:16.368
Glad you came.

02:10:16.403 --> 02:10:18.040
That surprises me,

02:10:18.075 --> 02:10:20.471
'cause we haven't been
getting on as of late.

02:10:22.178 --> 02:10:24.849
You told me I wasn't
walking in the spirit.

02:10:24.884 --> 02:10:25.817
I was angry.

02:10:26.545 --> 02:10:28.380
You were with God.

02:10:28.415 --> 02:10:29.986
You have always been with God.

02:10:31.418 --> 02:10:33.858
He was with me.

02:10:33.893 --> 02:10:36.355
I tried to run from Him,
but He brought me back.

02:10:36.896 --> 02:10:38.126
Like Jonah.

02:10:39.195 --> 02:10:40.425
Like Jonah.

02:10:44.035 --> 02:10:46.365
You taught me every song
I'm singing today.

02:10:51.075 --> 02:10:52.140
I did my best.

02:10:54.914 --> 02:10:57.541
But you have exceeded
all of my expectations, Ree.

02:10:59.116 --> 02:11:02.018
I'm about to bust wide open,

02:11:02.053 --> 02:11:05.021
and you're just
getting started.

02:11:05.056 --> 02:11:09.157
I can't imagine
what you're gonna do next.

02:11:10.963 --> 02:11:12.424
Because you can
do anything, Ree.

02:11:17.200 --> 02:11:19.167
First, give an honor to God

02:11:19.202 --> 02:11:21.499
who's the head
of all our lives.

02:11:21.534 --> 02:11:24.238
-Yes. Amen.
-

02:11:24.273 --> 02:11:26.944
I'm sure you all have
noticed the cameras by now.

02:11:28.211 --> 02:11:31.212
Don't get distracted by it.

02:11:31.247 --> 02:11:32.642
We here to have church, right?

02:11:32.677 --> 02:11:35.513
Amen.
- All right.

02:11:35.548 --> 02:11:39.484
This is the first
religious recordin'

02:11:39.519 --> 02:11:43.455
by our First Lady of Soul.

02:11:43.490 --> 02:11:47.195
Give a warm round of applause
for Miss Aretha Franklin.

02:12:23.398 --> 02:12:24.595
We love you.

02:13:20.620 --> 02:13:27.658
-

02:13:56.491 --> 02:14:00.460
The sound

02:15:30.849 --> 02:15:33.256
- Amen. Amen.

02:16:13.529 --> 02:16:17.894
of the storm

02:16:34.648 --> 02:16:41.456
It was grace

02:17:00.807 --> 02:17:04.413
Safe

02:18:12.384 --> 02:18:18.388
on the morning rain

02:18:18.423 --> 02:18:23.690
so uninspired

02:18:26.023 --> 02:18:31.995
to face another day

02:18:32.030 --> 02:18:37.572
so tired

02:18:39.037 --> 02:18:45.646
life was so unkind

02:18:45.681 --> 02:18:50.915
to my piece of mind

02:18:50.950 --> 02:18:58.758
You make me feel

02:18:58.793 --> 02:19:04.896
like a natural woman

02:19:08.803 --> 02:19:14.609
was in the lost and found

02:19:15.941 --> 02:19:19.911
came along to claim it

02:19:23.114 --> 02:19:28.920
just what was wrong with me

02:19:28.955 --> 02:19:33.594
helped me name it

02:19:36.434 --> 02:19:42.802
of what I'm living for

02:19:42.837 --> 02:19:48.676
I don't need to do more

02:19:48.711 --> 02:19:55.617
You make me feel

02:19:55.652 --> 02:20:02.624
like a natural woman

02:20:05.761 --> 02:20:09.092
Oh, baby
What you done to me

02:20:12.064 --> 02:20:19.476
so, so, so good inside

02:20:19.511 --> 02:20:23.711
-

02:20:23.746 --> 02:20:29.585
that makes me feel so alive

02:20:32.755 --> 02:20:36.460
-

02:20:36.495 --> 02:20:39.925
-

02:20:39.960 --> 02:20:43.599
-

02:20:43.634 --> 02:20:47.196
-

02:20:49.805 --> 02:20:52.674
-

02:20:52.709 --> 02:20:55.545
-

02:20:59.980 --> 02:21:03.080
-

02:21:03.115 --> 02:21:06.215
-

02:21:06.250 --> 02:21:08.756
-

02:21:11.827 --> 02:21:16.192
-

02:21:16.227 --> 02:21:18.161
-

02:21:18.196 --> 02:21:21.637
-

02:21:40.757 --> 02:21:43.021
-

02:22:07.718 --> 02:22:13.249
Too long

02:23:08.647 --> 02:23:13.012
Sing my way

02:23:32.132 --> 02:23:36.200
But unheard

02:23:45.112 --> 02:23:49.345
they won't let you fly

02:24:07.233 --> 02:24:09.937
in your hands
