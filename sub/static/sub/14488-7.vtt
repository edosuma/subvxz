it's actually my fault

might be on time

Very well. Cubert,
fetch my drinking teeth.

you leave a nude

Does it have to be nude?

to do that again.

The other place had
a lot of good things, too!

12:33.670 --> 12:35.587
Did you even see
that mountain of skulls?

12:35.672 --> 12:36.964
Why, you!

12:38.049 --> 12:39.508
Oh, no, you didn't.

12:40.468 --> 12:41.468
(ALL GRUNTING)

12:42.220 --> 12:45.639
Stop! Somewhere, sometime,
Leela is waiting for me.

12:45.723 --> 12:48.350
We need to keep looking
for a backwards time machine.

12:48.435 --> 12:49.476
Fry's right.

12:49.561 --> 12:52.729
Yes.
We have to work together,
not have this fight,

12:52.814 --> 12:54.481
which I was
definitely winning.

12:56.693 --> 12:58.277
FARNSWORTH:
The year one billion.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.320
I've got a feeling
this could be exactly

13:00.405 --> 13:03.031
the point in time
we've been looking for!

13:04.576 --> 13:05.617
Nope.

13:08.705 --> 13:11.623
In fact,
all life is extinct.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.460
So let's keep going forward.

13:14.544 --> 13:17.629
It's no use.
Earth is dead.

13:17.714 --> 13:20.716
This is the end
of all things.

13:36.900 --> 13:39.234
The Cavern on the Green.

13:44.032 --> 13:45.949
I made it, Leela.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.452
Sorry I'm
a billion years late.

13:49.078 --> 13:50.204
(GASPS)

14:02.217 --> 14:05.344
You'll get your
alimony check, Cubert.
Now get lost!

14:05.428 --> 14:08.514
Chill out.
I'm just here to see Amy.

14:08.598 --> 14:12.935
Move it, boy toy.
Granny's taking you
to Atlantic City.

14:16.272 --> 14:18.857
I don't know why
you ever married
that pig-nosed punk.

14:18.942 --> 14:21.860
I don't know, either.
I'm married to the job now.

14:21.945 --> 14:25.239
I used to think
there was someone
for me, but... Ow!

14:26.282 --> 14:30.744
How odd. It's one of those old
record-your-own-message
birthday cards.

14:30.828 --> 14:32.037
(TUNE PLAYING)

14:32.121 --> 14:33.455
Happy birthday, Leela!

14:33.540 --> 14:35.374
I'm really sorry
I'm gonna be one minute late,

14:35.458 --> 14:37.876
'cause we're testing
the professor's dumb
time machine...

14:37.961 --> 14:41.588
But, you know,
happy birthday and all, and,

14:42.298 --> 14:45.634
I love you.
(SCREAMS) My card!

14:49.472 --> 14:54.226
My whole life
I've been mad at him,
and it wasn't his fault.

15:37.937 --> 15:42.691
(LEELA READING)

15:52.660 --> 15:55.412
You know, all in all,
I had a good life.

15:55.496 --> 15:57.289
What do you say
the three of us grab
a six-pack

15:57.373 --> 15:58.957
and watch
the universe end?

15:59.042 --> 16:00.125
Hear! Hear!

16:00.209 --> 16:02.336
That's basically
what I do every day.

16:05.548 --> 16:07.716
To the end of the universe!

16:21.481 --> 16:24.691
So long, Earth.
Thanks for the air
and whatnot.

16:32.408 --> 16:33.659
Whoa!
Whoa!

16:34.452 --> 16:37.162
Hey, what was the
purpose of life anyway?

16:37.246 --> 16:41.500
Who knows?
Probably some hogwash
about the human spirit.

16:41.584 --> 16:42.709
Sounds about right.

16:46.089 --> 16:48.048
FARNSWORTH: The stars
are receding.

16:48.299 --> 16:50.967
Oh, the vast emptiness!

16:52.095 --> 16:54.554
Yeah, yeah,
I can take a hint.

16:59.435 --> 17:02.771
The last proton
should be decaying
about now.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.271
Bye, last proton.

17:04.523 --> 17:09.277
And, here we are.
The end of the universe.

17:17.161 --> 17:19.663
Well, now what?
You guys want to talk?

17:19.747 --> 17:20.789
No, thanks.

17:23.792 --> 17:25.042
Did anyone else see that?

17:25.127 --> 17:26.294
Unbelievable!

17:26.378 --> 17:28.630
It's a second big bang!

17:34.595 --> 17:37.597
My God, is it possible?

17:37.682 --> 17:39.766
It must be possible.
It's happening.

17:39.851 --> 17:41.560
By the way,
what's happening?

17:41.644 --> 17:46.231
It appears this universe
is exactly identical
to the old one.

17:46.315 --> 17:49.860
If so, we just need
to keep going forward
in time

17:49.944 --> 17:51.653
to the point when we left!

17:56.492 --> 17:58.326
The Earth is born!

18:04.834 --> 18:07.878
Ladies and gentlemen,
the moon!

18:08.337 --> 18:10.839
Look. The first fish
to crawl up on land.

18:12.216 --> 18:14.259
It was coming right at us!
You saw it.

18:14.385 --> 18:16.511
I'm gonna grab
another beer.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.681
Fry, Fry,
you're missing
the dinosaurs!

18:19.766 --> 18:22.392
It's okay.
They're not going anywhere.

18:23.019 --> 18:24.186
Where'd they go?

18:32.361 --> 18:33.695
Now, what's going on there?

18:33.780 --> 18:34.821
History.

18:34.906 --> 18:37.449
Hang on.
I just want to
make one stop.

18:40.328 --> 18:41.620
(CROWD SHOUTING)

18:42.163 --> 18:44.873
(SHOUTING IN GERMAN)

19:03.226 --> 19:05.268
FARNSWORTH: Easy, easy.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.646
Taking her in
for a landing.

19:07.730 --> 19:10.941
One year to go.
Six months.

19:11.025 --> 19:12.400
I'm almost there, Leela.

19:12.485 --> 19:15.821
One month,
two weeks, one hour,

19:16.280 --> 19:20.200
30 seconds, and here we...

19:20.284 --> 19:21.660
Whoa!

19:22.161 --> 19:24.287
Stop!
Give me the keys, Magoo!

19:28.584 --> 19:30.627
We'll have to
bring her around again.

19:41.931 --> 19:44.850
Just slow it down.
I'll shoot Hitler
out the window.

19:46.269 --> 19:49.396
Darn! I hit Eleanor
Roosevelt by mistake.

19:49.772 --> 19:52.732
Okay,
nearing our era again.

19:53.109 --> 19:56.945
Here we go.
Careful this time.

19:57.488 --> 19:58.947
Careful.

19:59.115 --> 20:02.742
We're going to test it
by going forward
in time one minute.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.202
Get in.

20:04.287 --> 20:06.288
Okay. Hurry.
Let's get it over with.

20:08.291 --> 20:09.291
Uh-oh.

20:09.375 --> 20:13.086
This new universe
is about 10 feet lower
than our old one.

20:16.465 --> 20:19.926
Pow! We took care of
the time travel paradox.

20:20.011 --> 20:21.469
All right!
Hooray!

20:22.221 --> 20:24.306
Uh-oh. I'm late for
dinner with Leela.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.227
Welcome to
Cavern on the Green.

20:29.312 --> 20:32.355
May I offer you
some meat loaf
while you wait?

20:32.440 --> 20:33.732
Sorry I'm late!

20:33.816 --> 20:35.525
Actually, you're on time.

20:35.943 --> 20:36.985
Really?

20:37.069 --> 20:40.488
I have to admit,
I was afraid you
wouldn't make it.

20:40.573 --> 20:43.742
That was the old Fry.
He's dead now.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.203
Happy birthday, Leela.

20:47.330 --> 20:50.081
I got you a card,
but I guess I
kind of lost it.

20:50.166 --> 20:52.751
That's okay.
I don't really like cards.

20:52.835 --> 20:55.545
What I'll remember is
our time together.
