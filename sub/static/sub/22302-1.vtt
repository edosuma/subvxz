00:15.473 --> 00:19.477
[Grant Achatz] <i>Early on in Alinea,</i>
<i>we had this realization that...</i>

00:20.353 --> 00:25.483
<i>there's other disciplines</i>
<i>that we can draw on for inspiration.</i>

00:28.820 --> 00:34.159
<i>We would go to art galleries and you would</i>
<i>see these giant-scale pieces of art.</i>

00:34.242 --> 00:38.246
<i>And I would always say,</i>
<i>"Why can't we plate on that?"</i>

00:40.665 --> 00:43.460
<i>It frustrated me that, as chefs,</i>

00:43.543 --> 00:49.132
<i>we were limited to scale that was</i>
<i>determined by plate manufacturers.</i>

00:51.134 --> 00:55.388
<i>Why not a tablecloth...</i>
<i>that we can eat off of?</i>

00:59.392 --> 01:02.270
<i>Why do you have to eat</i>
<i>with a fork or a spoon?</i>

01:02.395 --> 01:05.065
<i>And why does it have to be served</i>
<i>on a plate or in a bowl?</i>

01:05.148 --> 01:07.233
<i>Why can't we come up with something new?</i>

01:16.743 --> 01:21.206
<i>Every element of the restaurant</i>
<i>we try to break down and go,</i>

01:21.289 --> 01:25.418
<i>"Is this the best way it could exist,</i>
<i>or is there a better version?"</i>

01:31.299 --> 01:32.509
<i>Rules?</i>
[scoffs]

01:32.592 --> 01:35.094
There are no rules.
Do whatever you want.

01:40.391 --> 01:42.352
[opening theme playing]

03:05.393 --> 03:07.103
[air hissing]

03:09.647 --> 03:11.232
[Francis Lam]
<i>So when I was in culinary school,</i>

03:11.316 --> 03:13.526
<i>Grant was named one of</i> Food & Wine's
<i>Best New Chefs,</i>

03:13.610 --> 03:16.779
<i>and my chef instructor was like,</i>
<i>"This is bullshit."</i>

03:16.863 --> 03:19.824
He was so incensed by the description
of one of Grant's dishes

03:19.908 --> 03:24.537
where you pour boiling water into rosemary
to get the rosemary scent while you eat.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.915
And he's like, "That's the most
pretentious thing I ever heard.

03:26.998 --> 03:29.626
If you want rosemary,
you put it in the damn dish."

03:29.709 --> 03:32.712
And you know, fast-forward
however many years later, I'm at Alinea,

03:32.795 --> 03:35.590
and you put a dish on a pillow,

03:35.673 --> 03:37.550
and there's a scent coming out
of the pillow,

03:37.634 --> 03:38.968
and every time you cut into the dish,

03:39.052 --> 03:40.220
and there's a little puff of the scent.

03:40.303 --> 03:44.390
And I'm like,
"This is magic. This is magic."

03:52.857 --> 03:55.026
[Francis] <i>I really can't think</i>
<i>of another restaurant where,</i>

03:55.109 --> 03:57.695
<i>when I tell people</i>
<i>about the experience of it,</i>

03:57.779 --> 04:00.865
<i>I don't even wanna tell them</i>
<i>how you get into the place.</i>

04:01.950 --> 04:06.162
<i>Because even the experience</i>
<i>of walking into Alinea</i>

04:06.246 --> 04:09.540
<i>is disorienting and weird</i>

04:09.624 --> 04:11.751
and kind of uncomfortable,
but kinda magical.

04:13.544 --> 04:18.091
<i>You open the door and it looks</i>
<i>like a hallway that goes on for 100 feet.</i>

04:18.174 --> 04:20.343
<i>And maybe eight steps into it,</i>

04:20.426 --> 04:22.679
<i>a door to the side of the hallway</i>
<i>just opens.</i>

04:22.762 --> 04:24.430
<i>You're like,</i>
<i>"Wait, where was the rest of the hallway?"</i>

04:24.514 --> 04:26.808
And you look,
and it's an optical illusion.

04:26.891 --> 04:30.228
But in retrospect,
it's also this thing where you realize...

04:30.311 --> 04:33.273
they're totally gonna mess with you.
[laughing]

04:33.356 --> 04:35.483
They're totally gonna screw
with your brain.

04:35.566 --> 04:40.530
And for ever-how-long you're there,
you really don't know what's gonna happen.

04:58.423 --> 05:01.426
The questions that Grant asks himself
are so unlike

05:01.509 --> 05:04.429
the questions that any other chef
that I know have asked themself.

05:04.512 --> 05:08.266
<i>He's asking himself questions</i>
<i>like, "Can I make that float?"</i>

05:08.349 --> 05:11.144
<i>Or, "Can I make that invisible?"</i>

05:11.227 --> 05:14.397
<i>Or, "Can I hide this food</i>
<i>in front of the guests?"</i>

05:15.648 --> 05:19.319
<i>For Grant, creativity means</i>
<i>doing something that's impossible,</i>

05:19.402 --> 05:21.404
and has never been done and is new.

05:26.492 --> 05:29.996
<i>I think really what they did</i>
<i>when they built Alinea</i>

05:30.079 --> 05:32.915
<i>was start from the very bottom</i>
<i>and think about...</i>

05:32.999 --> 05:36.502
"What is every element of a restaurant
guest experience?

05:36.586 --> 05:38.671
And how can we change it?"

05:48.389 --> 05:50.183
<i>What they've done is</i>

05:50.266 --> 05:53.227
<i>make something that looks and feels</i>
<i>enough like a restaurant</i>

05:53.311 --> 05:55.897
<i>for you to think</i>
<i>that what you're doing is having dinner,</i>

05:55.980 --> 05:58.149
<i>when in reality,</i>
<i>you're having an experience</i>

05:58.232 --> 06:02.528
<i>that you can decide is dinner or theater,</i>

06:02.612 --> 06:06.699
or performance or therapy,
or, you know... [laughs]

06:06.783 --> 06:10.620
whatever the hell you walk away
from feeling and thinking about it.

06:10.703 --> 06:11.704
[indistinct chatter]

06:11.788 --> 06:14.791
[man] But I need centerpiece runners,
12 by 23.

06:14.874 --> 06:17.001
-You ready for these corn?
-[man] Yes, Chef.

06:17.085 --> 06:18.544
Okay, where's my runner?

06:18.628 --> 06:21.756
Walking the centerpieces now, Chef.
I'll get you corn runner, Chef.

06:22.840 --> 06:27.303
[Grant] <i>The leading chefs in the world</i>
<i>know that they can make delicious food.</i>

06:28.346 --> 06:31.099
<i>So, we have to take it a step further.</i>

06:32.266 --> 06:35.728
<i>At Alinea, we're actually trying</i>
<i>to curate an experience.</i>

06:41.651 --> 06:46.239
I want the guest
to have a sense of wonderment.

06:46.322 --> 06:47.490
"What's gonna happen next?"

06:47.573 --> 06:48.866
[air hissing]

06:48.950 --> 06:52.453
<i>They shouldn't go,</i>
<i>"I know what this is gonna be like."</i>

06:52.537 --> 06:54.914
<i>They should expect the unexpected.</i>

07:01.587 --> 07:05.550
<i>There's always been a bit</i>
<i>of a misconception, I feel, that...</i>

07:05.633 --> 07:10.930
we are growing things
in test tubes and petri dishes.

07:11.889 --> 07:15.893
<i>Actually, we're sourcing</i>
<i>as responsible chefs.</i>

07:15.977 --> 07:19.564
<i>And so, we're starting</i>
<i>with a fantastic product,</i>

07:19.647 --> 07:22.733
and then we're twisting it along the way.

07:24.068 --> 07:27.989
<i>We throw out those challenges,</i>
<i>where we go,</i>

07:28.072 --> 07:33.077
"We've got this beautiful thing.
How can you uphold this integrity,

07:33.161 --> 07:39.208
but make it look like something...
nobody's ever seen before?"

07:44.172 --> 07:45.965
<i>We can cut it different ways,</i>

07:46.048 --> 07:48.634
<i>we can pur√©e it, we can foam it.</i>

07:49.802 --> 07:52.597
Or, we can make it look like
something else.

07:55.683 --> 07:58.394
<i>And so the idea was...</i>

07:58.478 --> 08:03.065
What if something looks like a strawberry
but it actually is a tomato?

08:04.984 --> 08:09.238
<i>And have something that looks like</i>
<i>a tomato, but it tastes like a strawberry.</i>

08:10.573 --> 08:13.367
<i>Is it a tomato?</i>
<i>Is it a strawberry?</i>

08:13.451 --> 08:15.328
It's kind of a mind game.

08:23.544 --> 08:26.047
<i>I can give you a slice of bread</i>
<i>and a tomato,</i>

08:26.130 --> 08:28.466
<i>and you could eat it and go,</i>
<i>"Wow, it's delicious."</i>

08:28.549 --> 08:31.802
<i>And you can have</i>
<i>the tomato/strawberry course</i>

08:31.886 --> 08:34.138
<i>with pumpernickel crumb, and you can go...</i>

08:34.222 --> 08:36.933
-[waiter] Order in, two.
<i>-..."Wow, that's delicious, and...</i>

08:37.016 --> 08:39.101
[chuckles] that's really cool."

08:39.185 --> 08:41.938
That's what we have to do, right?

08:42.021 --> 08:44.065
Otherwise, I just give you
a slice of bread and a tomato,

08:44.148 --> 08:47.818
and you go,
"Why am I paying $500 for this?"

08:47.902 --> 08:49.153
[chuckles] Right?

08:53.241 --> 08:54.325
So this is a bread--

08:54.408 --> 08:57.411
French fries for you, garlic aioli,

08:57.495 --> 09:00.248
-then two of the regulars...
-[boy] Me?

09:02.750 --> 09:04.877
-What did you get?
-[boy] The hamburger.

09:05.878 --> 09:07.505
[Grant] <i>I was four and a half</i>

09:07.588 --> 09:10.424
<i>when my mother and father</i>
<i>got their first diner.</i>

09:11.467 --> 09:15.388
<i>I spent more time in a diner</i>
<i>than I did in my actual house.</i>

09:15.471 --> 09:17.306
What do you want?

09:17.390 --> 09:19.684
[Grant] <i>Uncle Norm worked</i>
<i>at the diner as a cook.</i>

09:19.767 --> 09:21.269
<i>And he was the bully uncle.</i>

09:21.352 --> 09:24.480
You never knew
when he was trying to pull a prank

09:24.564 --> 09:26.065
or he was being sincere.

09:27.692 --> 09:30.069
<i>So, we had these pickles.</i>

09:30.152 --> 09:32.029
<i>He would grab a bundle of French fries</i>

09:32.113 --> 09:34.282
<i>and wrap the pickle</i>
<i>around the French fries,</i>

09:34.365 --> 09:35.908
<i>and he would pop one in his mouth.</i>

09:35.992 --> 09:37.702
<i>And I happened to see him.</i>

09:37.785 --> 09:39.120
<i>In my head, I'm going,</i>

09:39.203 --> 09:42.081
"He's doing it so that I do it,
so that he can laugh at me,"

09:42.164 --> 09:43.791
is basically what I was thinking.

09:45.126 --> 09:47.211
<i>I go, "All right. Let me try it."</i>

09:47.295 --> 09:50.256
<i>Reluctantly, I took a little bite,</i>

09:50.339 --> 09:52.258
<i>and it was delicious.</i>
<i>And I go,</i>

09:52.341 --> 09:58.180
"That sounds terrible. It sounds gross.
Why does it... why does it taste good?"

09:58.264 --> 10:01.392
He went through the steps of explaining
why it worked.

10:01.475 --> 10:04.937
You have starch, you have fat,
you have acid, you have salt.

10:05.021 --> 10:08.774
Everything balances. And at that moment,
I fell in love with cooking.

10:13.404 --> 10:17.450
<i>And it wasn't about physical cooking.</i>

10:17.533 --> 10:21.495
For me it was about curiosity,
it was about toying with things.

10:23.623 --> 10:27.752
<i>When I was probably 16,</i>
<i>I would garnish a Western omelet</i>

10:27.835 --> 10:31.714
<i>with an orange twist</i>
<i>and a sprig of parsley or something.</i>

10:31.797 --> 10:36.135
And my dad would be like,
"You're wasting your time.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.680
Food just needs to be hot and fast."

10:40.931 --> 10:44.685
<i>There was never</i>
<i>any elements of expression,</i>

10:44.769 --> 10:48.064
<i>or storytelling or art...</i>

10:48.147 --> 10:51.400
To my father,
it was nothing more than a paycheck.

10:53.069 --> 10:58.699
<i>I thought there has to be something</i>
<i>more than Western omelets and hamburgers.</i>

11:06.749 --> 11:09.585
[Grant] <i>Well, I wonder</i>
<i>if you were able to trick people.</i>

11:09.669 --> 11:11.587
[man] Right.
[Grant] It'd be cool if there was

11:11.671 --> 11:13.339
a silhouette of...

11:13.422 --> 11:15.549
-an orange slice under there.
-[man] Yeah.

11:15.633 --> 11:19.970
And it was dropped in front of somebody,
and they would look through that

11:20.054 --> 11:22.014
and say, "Oh, well,
there's an orange under here."

11:22.098 --> 11:24.642
And then you would lift it and...

11:24.725 --> 11:26.602
it wasn't an orange.
It was something else.

11:26.685 --> 11:28.354
[man] That would be interesting,
if we can have

11:28.437 --> 11:31.607
the food actually play off
of the pattern in the piece.

11:31.690 --> 11:34.402
Then we can basically build
a pattern that

11:34.485 --> 11:38.239
you wouldn't necessarily read as anything
other than a decoration.

11:38.322 --> 11:41.409
That could be really neat. Yeah.

11:41.492 --> 11:46.122
[Grant] <i>It's a fun dynamic to be able</i>
<i>to surprise people with food.</i>

11:46.205 --> 11:47.873
<i>That's always the thing for us.</i>

11:47.957 --> 11:50.668
At every turn,
there's, like, a little twist.

11:51.836 --> 11:56.048
<i>For this current course, it started tiny.</i>

11:56.132 --> 11:59.260
<i>It was the idea of a centerpiece</i>

11:59.343 --> 12:03.431
that's evocative
and produces conversation,

12:03.514 --> 12:06.642
<i>and then, ultimately,</i>
<i>it becomes part of the meal.</i>

12:07.685 --> 12:12.565
Now you have something
that is both beautiful and functional.

12:13.315 --> 12:15.734
<i>So then we take that idea and we just go,</i>

12:15.818 --> 12:18.779
<i>"How many times can we do that</i>
<i>in the course of the meal?"</i>

12:20.656 --> 12:24.452
<i>We took all the tools out of the belt</i>
<i>and we used them all.</i>

12:24.535 --> 12:26.454
[indistinct chatter]

12:47.683 --> 12:52.021
[Grant] <i>You have what appears to be</i>
<i>just a pile of wood on fire.</i>

12:52.104 --> 12:54.607
<i>There's a sense of intrigue</i>
<i>and mystery there</i>

12:54.690 --> 12:57.026
because you don't really know
why the fire is there.

12:57.109 --> 12:59.737
<i>Then we trick you into thinking</i>

12:59.820 --> 13:03.365
<i>the fire is there so that you can take</i>
<i>the pine branches off</i>

13:03.449 --> 13:06.744
<i>with the unagi and the plum</i>
<i>and warm it up.</i>

13:08.871 --> 13:11.207
<i>And then at one point,</i>
<i>as you're eating your way through</i>

13:11.290 --> 13:13.375
<i>all of these other components,</i>

13:13.459 --> 13:17.171
<i>the captain will come over to the table,</i>
<i>remove the fire...</i>

13:18.214 --> 13:20.257
<i>pull apart the fire.</i>

13:21.258 --> 13:23.511
<i>In the middle, you have</i>

13:23.594 --> 13:27.056
<i>a piece of chicken thigh</i>
<i>that's been wrapped in kombu...</i>

13:27.139 --> 13:29.642
roasting in that fire, hidden.

13:32.311 --> 13:36.565
<i>They go, "You're actually cooking</i>
<i>in front of us. We didn't even know it."</i>

13:39.443 --> 13:45.950
<i>And now they have basically</i>
<i>eight courses within a half hour</i>

13:46.033 --> 13:49.036
<i>that are all somehow weaved together.</i>

13:51.080 --> 13:55.584
<i>The thing that's important for me</i>
<i>is the guest has...</i>

13:56.961 --> 13:58.837
the a-ha moment,

13:58.921 --> 14:02.508
where they feel
that they've "discovered" something.

14:04.468 --> 14:08.430
<i>It's like being a kid and opening</i>
<i>the present at Christmas.</i>

14:10.391 --> 14:15.312
<i>Until you lift that lid and peer inside,</i>
<i>you don't really know what's in there.</i>

14:16.981 --> 14:20.359
<i>And then there's the reveal.</i>
<i>And then there's the reward.</i>

14:24.321 --> 14:25.698
It's a magic show.

14:35.040 --> 14:38.627
Thank you. Thank you.
Good night. Thank you.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.172
[Grant] <i>I remember,</i>
<i>when I was at culinary school,</i>

14:42.256 --> 14:45.342
<i>I was just ripping through cookbooks.</i>

14:45.426 --> 14:49.054
And Charlie Trotter's first book
had just come out.

14:50.014 --> 14:53.642
<i>He was taking food to a new place.</i>

14:54.518 --> 14:57.021
That's ultimately what drew me there.

14:58.022 --> 15:03.360
<i>I was diner and culinary school educated.</i>

15:03.444 --> 15:05.696
<i>So, I can cook a mean breakfast.</i>

15:05.779 --> 15:08.699
<i>But I was young and green, and...</i>

15:09.241 --> 15:11.118
I didn't know what fine dining was.

15:12.828 --> 15:15.331
<i>I walked in the kitchen.</i>

15:15.414 --> 15:18.918
<i>It was nothing like I'd ever experienced.</i>

15:19.001 --> 15:22.254
It was... cutthroat.

15:22.922 --> 15:28.302
<i>The cooks would sabotage you.</i>
<i>They wanted to see you fail.</i>

15:28.385 --> 15:30.387
[laughs] <i>There was no teamwork.</i>

15:30.471 --> 15:33.974
And at the pinnacle of this,
at the head of the totem pole,

15:34.058 --> 15:35.809
stands Charlie Trotter.

15:38.479 --> 15:41.315
<i>He was a master manipulator.</i>

15:42.399 --> 15:45.569
He could get inside your head
and make you move like a little puppet,

15:45.653 --> 15:46.862
however he wanted.

15:49.239 --> 15:50.783
<i>Just the idea of</i>

15:50.866 --> 15:53.994
<i>the connection that you have</i>
<i>when you cook for somebody.</i>

15:54.703 --> 15:56.956
<i>There was none of that.</i>
<i>It felt sterile.</i>

15:57.039 --> 15:59.083
<i>It felt stripped away.</i>

16:01.043 --> 16:05.923
It made me question
everything about... cooking.

16:08.676 --> 16:11.095
<i>Maybe I made the wrong decision.</i>

16:13.263 --> 16:15.683
<i>Maybe I'm not good at this.</i>

16:18.686 --> 16:21.897
<i>I told him I needed to leave.</i>

16:21.981 --> 16:25.776
He tells me how, if I leave,

16:25.859 --> 16:30.948
there'll be no record of me
ever working at the restaurant.

16:31.031 --> 16:33.367
I won't amount to anything.

16:35.452 --> 16:40.958
<i>I leave Trotter's defeated,</i>
<i>questioning everything.</i>

16:58.684 --> 17:01.603
I mean, literally, look at this.

17:02.646 --> 17:04.982
-This one's super cool.
-Want me to get more from your house?

17:05.065 --> 17:07.359
-I mean, look at how, just, cool that is.
-That's badass.

17:07.443 --> 17:09.862
-Yeah, yeah. Totally. Totally.
-It looks like a pencil.

17:09.945 --> 17:11.155
-Okay.
-And smell it.

17:11.238 --> 17:12.781
-It's, like...
-Yeah, it's just like--

17:12.865 --> 17:14.992
-...crazy. Yeah.
-Yeah. Awesome.

17:15.075 --> 17:18.787
[Grant] <i>For me, aroma's always</i>
<i>been incredibly important,</i>

17:18.871 --> 17:20.748
<i>in terms of my memory.</i>

17:20.831 --> 17:22.458
<i>That scent of roasted turkey...</i>

17:22.541 --> 17:24.543
[snaps fingers]
<i>immediately transports me back</i>

17:24.626 --> 17:29.006
<i>to when I was ten years old</i>
<i>on Thanksgiving Day surrounded by family.</i>

17:29.089 --> 17:30.799
That's a powerful thing.

17:30.883 --> 17:34.428
If you can capture that,
if you can harness that

17:34.511 --> 17:37.931
to make a...
a great dining experience...

17:38.015 --> 17:40.517
I think it's compelling.

17:43.437 --> 17:49.026
<i>I started thinking about involving smells</i>
<i>into the experience.</i>

17:50.110 --> 17:53.697
How do we insert
seasoning food with aroma?

17:54.239 --> 17:55.991
[Grant] Simon?
[Simon] Yes, Chef?

17:56.075 --> 17:58.243
[Grant] How are the pillows?
[Simon] Pillows are good, Chef.

17:58.327 --> 17:59.620
Ready to go.

17:59.703 --> 18:03.290
[Grant] <i>I had a friend</i>
<i>come back from Amsterdam,</i>

18:03.373 --> 18:07.586
and showed me, uh, a vaporizer.

18:13.217 --> 18:17.930
<i>We started filling the chamber with</i>
<i>all kinds of these really strong aromas,</i>

18:18.013 --> 18:24.186
<i>and we were able to take that aroma,</i>
<i>encapsulate it in a pillow,</i>

18:24.311 --> 18:28.107
<i>and have that flavor a dish at the table.</i>

18:37.074 --> 18:41.245
[Francis] <i>In a restaurant where you are</i>
<i>working in the emotional realm</i>

18:41.328 --> 18:43.288
<i>as much as you're working</i>
<i>in the sensory realm,</i>

18:43.372 --> 18:47.084
<i>scent is gonna be the bridge</i>
<i>between the two that's most direct.</i>

18:48.043 --> 18:51.255
Everyone has that moment
where they smell that first perfume

18:51.338 --> 18:53.632
or that first cologne
that your, like, first date wore.

18:53.715 --> 18:55.467
And you remember it
[snaps fingers] instantly.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.052
It doesn't matter where you are,
how old you are.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.178
You remember it instantly.

18:59.429 --> 19:00.514
<i>When they play with aroma,</i>

19:00.597 --> 19:05.936
<i>they turn a meal</i>
<i>into a truly emotional experience.</i>

19:08.814 --> 19:14.111
We treat the emotional component
of cooking food

19:14.194 --> 19:16.238
as a seasoning.

19:16.780 --> 19:20.242
You add salt, you add sugar,
you add vinegar...

19:20.325 --> 19:22.119
you add nostalgia.

19:25.664 --> 19:30.252
<i>If you're able to move people,</i>
<i>we're moving on to something else.</i>

19:30.335 --> 19:34.798
<i>It's not just about food. It's not just</i>
<i>about a restaurant or eating dinner.</i>

19:35.799 --> 19:38.010
<i>It's about something more.</i>

19:54.026 --> 19:56.486
[Grant] <i>After leaving Trotter's,</i>

19:56.570 --> 19:59.865
<i>I was paging through</i>
<i>a</i> Wine Spectator <i>magazine.</i>

19:59.948 --> 20:02.326
<i>And way in the back,</i>
<i>there was a little paragraph</i>

20:02.409 --> 20:04.077
<i>about this new restaurant</i>

20:04.161 --> 20:07.247
that had just opened in Yountville
called The French Laundry.

20:09.458 --> 20:12.753
<i>I read it and I said,</i>
<i>"You know, I wanna work there."</i>

20:13.837 --> 20:16.006
<i>I go out there, walk in the front door</i>

20:16.089 --> 20:21.094
and the first person I see
is some lanky guy mopping the floor,

20:21.178 --> 20:24.306
so I literally ask if the chef's in.

20:24.389 --> 20:26.183
And he said...

20:27.100 --> 20:28.310
"I'm Thomas."

20:30.312 --> 20:33.941
<i>It was such a departure coming</i>
<i>from Charlie's, management style,</i>

20:34.024 --> 20:38.153
to some guy that was the only one
in the kitchen, mopping the floor.

20:39.404 --> 20:42.950
<i>I started October 28th, 1996.</i>

20:43.033 --> 20:47.287
Thomas had won James Beard
Best Chef: California that year.

20:47.371 --> 20:49.998
The next year he won
Best Chef: United States.

20:51.750 --> 20:55.754
<i>It felt like I was rubbing shoulders</i>
<i>with the master.</i>

20:58.173 --> 21:00.050
<i>I wanted to be Thomas Keller.</i>

21:01.343 --> 21:05.722
<i>And I was super dedicated</i>
<i>to learning how to cook like him.</i>

21:07.599 --> 21:09.768
<i>Everything is analyzed.</i>

21:10.727 --> 21:13.897
<i>Is it perfect?</i>
<i>If it's not, how can we make it perfect?</i>

21:15.565 --> 21:21.029
<i>I just became passionate</i>
<i>about the pursuit of perfection.</i>

21:22.572 --> 21:26.535
<i>After being there for a while,</i>
<i>I felt like I could think like him.</i>

21:27.869 --> 21:31.957
<i>So, I come up with this caviar</i>
<i>and cantaloupe melon dish.</i>

21:34.751 --> 21:37.004
<i>I remember putting it in front of him.</i>

21:37.087 --> 21:40.882
<i>He tasted it, smiled, and said,</i>
<i>"That's really good."</i>

21:40.966 --> 21:45.220
For a young cook, that puts
your confidence at a level that's just--

21:45.304 --> 21:46.930
You're invincible at that point.

21:48.181 --> 21:51.435
<i>And then he said,</i>
<i>"You know what's gonna happen.</i>

21:51.518 --> 21:52.978
<i>We put this dish on the menu...</i>

21:53.103 --> 21:57.316
this is now a Thomas Keller dish
and you'll never be able to do it again.

21:57.399 --> 21:58.734
Are you okay with that?"

21:59.693 --> 22:03.405
[chuckles] Very arrogantly...

22:03.488 --> 22:05.490
I laughed, and I said...

22:05.574 --> 22:08.660
"Plenty more ideas where that came from.
Let's put it on the menu."

22:23.800 --> 22:28.263
Is there a way to expand,
instead of scale, time?

22:28.346 --> 22:31.516
We've never explored time really, right?

22:33.226 --> 22:34.603
Did I lose you?

22:34.728 --> 22:37.064
-That's some Stephen Hawking shit.
-[all laugh]

22:37.147 --> 22:41.651
Let's say we take one component
from all courses

22:41.735 --> 22:46.114
that we then use to make
the final dessert.

22:46.198 --> 22:49.534
All of the flavors
that you just experienced in the meal...

22:49.618 --> 22:52.662
would be represented in the final course.

22:52.746 --> 22:55.916
It'd just require an entire...
You'd have to plan the entire menu.

22:56.875 --> 22:58.919
[Mike Bagale]
We would literally start all over.

23:01.088 --> 23:03.924
[Grant] <i>Mike and I have this conversation</i>
<i>where I go,</i>

23:04.007 --> 23:06.802
<i>"Doing the same thing over and over again</i>
<i>feels boring to me."</i>

23:06.885 --> 23:11.098
And then he'll say, "Well, if you look
at the reservation sheet...

23:12.432 --> 23:14.643
none of the guests
that are coming in tonight

23:14.726 --> 23:17.479
have ever been to this restaurant before.

23:17.562 --> 23:19.773
So for them it's all new."

23:19.856 --> 23:23.485
And I go, "But, yeah, but...
what about us?"

23:31.910 --> 23:33.912
[Mike] <i>Every night,</i>
<i>we'll look at our menu.</i>

23:33.995 --> 23:35.872
<i>It's like, "Oh, we've been doing this</i>
<i>for three months.</i>

23:35.956 --> 23:37.457
<i>It's time for that to go."</i>

23:37.541 --> 23:39.459
And sometimes the process
just starts from that,

23:39.543 --> 23:41.002
on a night we just look at the menu.

23:41.086 --> 23:44.798
Absolutely crazy thought process,
but it's completely necessary.

23:54.057 --> 23:55.183
[Grant] <i>What is important?</i>

23:56.268 --> 24:00.021
<i>Is it... a signature dish?</i>

24:00.647 --> 24:04.860
<i>No, it's about having</i>
<i>a restaurant with philosophy,</i>

24:04.943 --> 24:09.114
<i>where the creativity is the priority.</i>

24:10.866 --> 24:15.370
<i>We could have created</i>
<i>a greatest hits menu...</i>

24:16.288 --> 24:18.999
but, I think, if we do that,

24:19.082 --> 24:24.671
we fall into that trap of...
almost counter-creativity.

24:32.137 --> 24:34.723
<i>I don't think Wednesday night,</i>

24:34.806 --> 24:37.392
<i>we're gonna put out the best meal</i>
<i>that we've ever put out.</i>

24:38.768 --> 24:42.480
<i>But I think it's important</i>
<i>to recognize the fact that...</i>

24:43.064 --> 24:44.983
<i>we're putting out different meals.</i>

24:45.066 --> 24:46.610
[inaudible]

24:48.028 --> 24:53.575
To me, the evolution of the experience
is almost more important.

24:56.119 --> 24:57.954
[bees buzzing]

24:59.664 --> 25:04.961
[Grant] <i>Thomas Keller was certainly</i>
<i>pushing boundaries and avant-garde.</i>

25:05.045 --> 25:08.006
But I was always wanting to go
a little bit further.

25:08.089 --> 25:10.842
And he recognized that and encouraged it.

25:12.552 --> 25:16.306
<i>He arranged for me to go work</i>
<i>at El Bulli for a week.</i>

25:18.016 --> 25:19.684
<i>When I walked into El Bulli,</i>

25:19.768 --> 25:23.647
the first thing Ferran did was
put me in the dining room...

25:23.730 --> 25:24.981
and fed me a meal.

25:27.275 --> 25:32.656
<i>There was translucent risotto</i>
<i>that looked like glass.</i>

25:33.615 --> 25:37.994
<i>There was a latex glove</i>
<i>that waved at you as you left.</i>

25:38.078 --> 25:40.914
<i>It felt like I was on Mars.</i>

25:40.997 --> 25:45.919
Ferran was like, "This is not only
meant to satisfy you here.

25:46.002 --> 25:48.088
It's meant to stimulate you here."

25:48.171 --> 25:50.966
And when I came back
to The French Laundry, I was just...

25:51.049 --> 25:55.387
super excited to go down
my own path of exploration.

25:55.470 --> 25:57.472
[machinery whirring]

25:59.766 --> 26:05.897
<i>I was rolling agnolotti,</i>
<i>and I pick up a leg of duck confit.</i>

26:05.981 --> 26:10.944
<i>The gelatin from the cooking liquid</i>
<i>starts melting in my hand.</i>

26:11.903 --> 26:15.532
I realize this solid
is turning into a liquid

26:15.615 --> 26:17.492
because of my body temperature.

26:20.537 --> 26:24.291
<i>In my head, I'm going,</i>
<i>"I need to get that really cold</i>

26:24.374 --> 26:28.211
<i>so that I can manipulate it</i>
<i>into pasta."</i>

26:29.087 --> 26:31.840
The solid becomes a liquid
inside the pasta,

26:31.923 --> 26:33.925
and now we got something
completely different.

26:38.722 --> 26:42.851
<i>I made it, put it on my cutting board,</i>
<i>and took a spoon and crushed it.</i>

26:42.934 --> 26:45.895
And the duck liquid
just came spreading out.

26:45.979 --> 26:47.105
It exploded.

26:47.981 --> 26:50.150
<i>And what is explosive flavor?</i>

26:50.233 --> 26:53.862
<i>And it just became obvious</i>
<i>that it had to be truffle.</i>

26:56.948 --> 27:00.493
And I started thinking,
"What more can come of this?"

27:04.873 --> 27:07.584
<i>What if this was</i>
<i>the nature of your cuisine...</i>

27:08.585 --> 27:14.716
were these interesting plays
on surprise and texture and aroma?

27:16.259 --> 27:18.261
<i>One of the cooks saw me create it,</i>

27:18.345 --> 27:21.806
and he came up to me and said,
"Thomas won't let you serve that."

27:24.976 --> 27:29.689
<i>It became pretty clear to me that</i>
<i>I needed to define how I wanted to cook.</i>

27:31.608 --> 27:34.027
<i>In order for me to do that...</i>

27:34.110 --> 27:37.947
<i>I had to leave The French Laundry.</i>

27:39.157 --> 27:43.161
<i>I had to leave</i>
<i>those confines of the rules.</i>

27:58.551 --> 28:02.472
<i>Trio was my first job</i>
<i>where I was in charge.</i>

28:03.473 --> 28:06.851
<i>That's where</i>
<i>I really started to hit a stride,</i>

28:06.935 --> 28:08.395
<i>and that's where I met Nick.</i>

28:09.437 --> 28:12.065
[Nick Kokonas] <i>My wife and I</i>
<i>went to dinner at Trio.</i>

28:12.148 --> 28:14.109
<i>This was in suburban Chicago.</i>

28:14.192 --> 28:19.030
And all of a sudden, there was
this, like, amazing, beautiful, elegant

28:19.114 --> 28:22.325
and, importantly, delicious food
coming out of the kitchen.

28:23.284 --> 28:25.370
<i>And I said to this waiter,</i>
<i>"What's going on?"</i>

28:25.453 --> 28:27.122
<i>He said, "We got this kid</i>
<i>from The French Laundry,</i>

28:27.205 --> 28:29.165
<i>and he's blowing our minds."</i>

28:29.249 --> 28:31.459
It was just the best restaurant
in the world at the time,

28:31.543 --> 28:32.669
and nobody knew it.

28:33.503 --> 28:38.174
[Grant] <i>I went out there one evening</i>
<i>and said, "How was everything?"</i>

28:38.258 --> 28:42.887
He looked at me and he goes, "If you ever
want to open a restaurant of your own...

28:42.971 --> 28:44.472
I would like to help you."

28:46.057 --> 28:48.852
<i>At Trio, I came into</i>
<i>a preexisting restaurant</i>

28:48.935 --> 28:51.020
<i>that had these limitations.</i>

28:51.938 --> 28:55.650
With this opportunity,
I could establish my style.

28:56.985 --> 28:58.945
[Nick] <i>Four days later,</i>
<i>at 5:30 in the morning,</i>

28:59.028 --> 29:00.613
<i>I got an email from Grant that said,</i>

29:00.697 --> 29:03.158
<i>"If you're serious,</i>
<i>I'd like to talk to you about this."</i>

29:03.241 --> 29:04.909
I woke my wife up and said,

29:04.993 --> 29:06.870
"We're gonna build
a restaurant with Grant."

29:06.953 --> 29:09.664
[man] Let's go! Break it down.
[all] Yeah!

29:12.584 --> 29:16.713
[Grant] <i>I was fixated</i>
<i>on finding a symbol</i>

29:16.796 --> 29:19.048
<i>that we could make a logo out of.</i>

29:21.176 --> 29:24.429
<i>There was this late-night</i>
<i>googling session,</i>

29:24.512 --> 29:29.851
and found the...
the alinea symbol...

29:30.602 --> 29:33.480
<i>and then looked at the definition.</i>

29:33.563 --> 29:36.232
<i>It was this perfect meaning.</i>

29:36.900 --> 29:38.568
The beginning of a new train of thought.

29:54.834 --> 29:56.753
<i>The whole philosophy</i>
<i>of the restaurant</i>

29:56.836 --> 29:59.506
<i>is going to be, "This is new...</i>

29:59.589 --> 30:03.176
and then it's new again.
And it's new again. And it's new again."

30:03.259 --> 30:05.929
[man] Here, let's plug the anti-griddle
in over here, okay?

30:06.012 --> 30:07.847
[Nick] <i>To me, it was like,</i>

30:07.931 --> 30:11.184
<i>"Hey, this will be</i>
<i>an interesting interlude for a year.</i>

30:11.267 --> 30:13.478
<i>I will help this really amazing guy</i>

30:13.561 --> 30:15.897
achieve one of his goals,
which is always a great thing."

30:15.980 --> 30:19.859
But it became evident to me that it was
more important than I thought it was.

30:26.491 --> 30:29.285
<i>He had genuinely believed from the time</i>
<i>he was, like, 12 years old</i>

30:29.369 --> 30:31.746
<i>this is what he was building up to be.</i>

30:33.498 --> 30:36.459
[Grant] <i>We gather the staff, and I say,</i>

30:36.543 --> 30:39.671
<i>"Everybody just needs</i>
<i>to believe the fact...</i>

30:39.754 --> 30:43.550
that we're about to open
the best restaurant...

30:43.633 --> 30:44.843
in the country.

30:45.927 --> 30:49.889
And anything less will be a failure."

30:53.142 --> 30:55.144
<i>A week later, we opened.</i>

30:55.228 --> 30:59.941
First night, we got the most important
food critics in the country...

31:00.024 --> 31:01.234
in the dining room.

31:01.317 --> 31:02.944
On night one.

31:05.947 --> 31:08.324
[Nick] <i>We got three pages in</i>
<i>the</i> New York Times

31:08.408 --> 31:09.701
<i>two days after we opened.</i>

31:09.784 --> 31:12.412
<i>I'm getting calls from everybody</i>
<i>I know in the country.</i> [chuckles]

31:12.495 --> 31:14.455
<i>"Congratulations."</i>

31:14.539 --> 31:17.625
[Grant] <i>The most important</i>
<i>food critic in the world</i>

31:17.709 --> 31:20.253
<i>called me and said,</i>

31:20.336 --> 31:24.549
<i>"We've selected you for the number one</i>
<i>restaurant in the country."</i>

31:29.762 --> 31:35.935
<i>It was an explosion of work</i>
<i>and excitement and creativity.</i>

31:37.186 --> 31:39.606
Everything's just moving
in the right direction.

31:43.109 --> 31:47.780
<i>I had this overwhelming</i>
<i>sense of gratification</i>

31:47.864 --> 31:54.037
<i>because this dream</i>
<i>that was out there since I was ten</i>

31:54.120 --> 31:55.997
<i>had been accomplished.</i>

32:14.515 --> 32:20.396
<i>When I was at Trio, I was noticing</i>
<i>a little white dot on my tongue.</i>

32:21.856 --> 32:26.861
<i>If I had something really acidic</i>
<i>or if I drank hot coffee,</i>

32:26.945 --> 32:28.905
<i>it was painful.</i>

32:28.988 --> 32:32.325
<i>I went to the dentist and they said,</i>

32:32.408 --> 32:36.204
"You're 28 years old,
you work 18 hours a day,

32:36.287 --> 32:39.916
you're stressed,
you're career-driven.

32:39.999 --> 32:41.876
You're biting your tongue."

32:43.753 --> 32:46.714
<i>During the period</i>
<i>where Nick and I are building Alinea,</i>

32:46.798 --> 32:48.758
<i>it continued to be a problem.</i>

32:49.634 --> 32:53.638
<i>I couldn't eat. I couldn't drink.</i>
<i>I could barely talk.</i>

32:53.721 --> 32:58.142
But during this whole time I'm going,
"I'm creating my dream right now."

32:58.226 --> 33:01.104
And so, it just got pushed away...

33:02.772 --> 33:05.942
<i>until the point where it got so bad...</i>

33:06.025 --> 33:09.028
<i>that you just couldn't ignore it anymore.</i>

33:11.072 --> 33:13.157
He looked like a heroin addict
or something like that.

33:13.241 --> 33:15.034
His hair had just started to get thin,

33:15.118 --> 33:17.370
and he just...
he looked like a drug addict.

33:17.453 --> 33:19.539
And this is a guy
who never did a drug in his life.

33:19.622 --> 33:21.499
And I was like,
"Dude, you're wearing yourself down."

33:21.582 --> 33:24.419
He's like, "No, it's this tongue thing.
I can't eat well...

33:24.502 --> 33:25.503
and all that. And I've got..."

33:25.586 --> 33:28.339
[stammers] He took gum,
and he was putting it over it.

33:28.423 --> 33:30.883
And I literally pulled him
into our polishing room,

33:30.967 --> 33:32.593
like... [chuckling] "Show me your tongue,"

33:32.677 --> 33:35.013
which, you know, sounds...
And he was like, "No!

33:35.096 --> 33:37.223
Dude, why am I showing you my tongue?"
You know?

33:37.306 --> 33:38.599
I was like, "Let me see your tongue."

33:38.683 --> 33:41.728
He showed it to me and I was like,
"Jesus Christ, like...

33:41.811 --> 33:43.062
You gotta go to a doctor.

33:43.146 --> 33:45.148
Skip the dentist.
Go to an oral surgeon."

33:47.442 --> 33:51.571
[Grant] <i>I go to the oral surgeon</i>
<i>and got a biopsy.</i>

33:51.654 --> 33:55.992
<i>Two days later, the secretary</i>
<i>at the office called me and said,</i>

33:56.075 --> 34:00.288
<i>"Mr. Achatz, we would really</i>
<i>like for you to come in.</i>

34:00.371 --> 34:02.081
<i>We have your results."</i>

34:03.124 --> 34:05.251
And I'm like, "Just tell me.

34:06.169 --> 34:08.546
Like, we're on the phone.
Just tell me what's going on."

34:09.839 --> 34:11.299
They wouldn't tell me.

34:15.928 --> 34:19.223
<i>We go in.</i>
<i>Nick is in the room with me.</i>

34:20.099 --> 34:22.143
<i>The guy says,</i>

34:22.226 --> 34:26.856
"I'm sorry to say that
you have stage IV-B cancer."

34:27.523 --> 34:32.403
And in my head I'm like, "All right.
So there's like, ten stages, right?

34:33.696 --> 34:35.573
<i>How serious is this?"</i>

34:38.076 --> 34:41.537
<i>And he goes, "We're gonna need</i>
<i>to remove three-quarters of your tongue,</i>

34:41.621 --> 34:46.417
all of your left mandible
and both sides of your neck.

34:48.336 --> 34:51.923
<i>And there's a 70% chance</i>
<i>that you're still gonna die."</i>

34:54.926 --> 34:57.845
<i>I looked him in the eye and said,</i>

34:57.929 --> 35:00.848
<i>"Are there any other options?"</i>

35:00.932 --> 35:03.726
<i>And he said, "In my opinion, no."</i>

35:14.529 --> 35:17.657
<i>It's one thing to go,</i>
<i>"Oh, I wonder how I'm gonna die."</i>

35:17.740 --> 35:20.910
<i>It's another thing to be told,</i>
<i>"You're gonna die."</i>

35:23.579 --> 35:26.332
<i>I felt bad for other people.</i>

35:26.415 --> 35:28.167
<i>I felt bad for my kids...</i>

35:29.961 --> 35:32.588
<i>not to have their dad.</i>

35:35.675 --> 35:38.302
[Nick] <i>I could see</i>
<i>that he was shutting down.</i>

35:38.386 --> 35:41.389
<i>I was like, "Okay, let's get out of here."</i>

35:41.472 --> 35:44.183
<i>And so we went across the street,</i>
<i>got a pitcher of margaritas,</i>

35:44.267 --> 35:45.518
<i>and we just got drunk.</i>

35:49.063 --> 35:53.401
[Grant] <i>We sat there,</i>
<i>and he's like, "What are you gonna do?"</i>

35:55.027 --> 35:56.487
<i>And I go...</i>

35:56.571 --> 35:58.865
"I'm just gonna die."

36:03.828 --> 36:07.540
[Nick] <i>He definitely did not want to exist</i>

36:07.623 --> 36:12.837
<i>without the ability to do what he viewed</i>
<i>as his core personal identity.</i>

36:15.673 --> 36:21.053
<i>He wanted my approval to not have</i>
<i>this dismembering surgery.</i>

36:21.137 --> 36:26.225
<i>He was gonna choose to die</i>
<i>as gracefully as he possibly could.</i>

36:27.476 --> 36:29.520
That's not a good place to get to.

36:45.953 --> 36:48.289
[Nick] <i>We realized that</i>
<i>it was gonna get out to the press,</i>

36:48.372 --> 36:51.542
<i>and so, I said to him,</i>
<i>"Let's draft something."</i>

36:51.626 --> 36:53.377
[train bell ringing]

36:53.461 --> 36:57.215
<i>I drafted it.</i>
<i>He had no interest in even reading it.</i>

36:57.298 --> 37:00.509
<i>He's like, "I'll be dead in three months.</i>
<i>What difference does it make?"</i>

37:00.593 --> 37:04.013
By putting that in the paper, though,
it's public knowledge.

37:04.096 --> 37:08.517
And now, the University of Chicago
is trying desperately to get a hold of me.

37:08.601 --> 37:11.938
And they get my home phone number,
and they call and they say,

37:12.021 --> 37:14.065
"Get him in here.

37:14.148 --> 37:15.274
We can help."

37:16.901 --> 37:20.029
[Grant] <i>They look me over,</i>
<i>they do an exam.</i>

37:20.112 --> 37:24.909
They confirm what everybody else said
in terms of the diagnosis, right?

37:24.992 --> 37:27.662
They're like,
"Yes, you have stage IV cancer."

37:27.745 --> 37:30.873
And then they go, "However...

37:32.500 --> 37:35.878
we think we can do this without surgery.

37:37.088 --> 37:44.011
And we think that you'll have
about a 70% survival rate."

37:45.805 --> 37:50.935
So, it was basically the inverted
version of what everyone else is saying.

37:50.977 --> 37:54.272
And they just went... [whistles]
Like that.

37:57.233 --> 38:00.820
<i>It was an experimental clinical trial.</i>

38:00.903 --> 38:02.989
<i>They were thinking differently,</i>

38:03.072 --> 38:05.992
<i>pulling apart the model,</i>
<i>putting it back together.</i>

38:07.285 --> 38:09.412
<i>I said, "Where do I sign?"</i>

38:09.495 --> 38:14.250
<i>And they whip out the paper</i>
<i>and away we go.</i>

38:17.295 --> 38:19.797
[Nick] <i>In two days, we went from</i>

38:19.880 --> 38:24.844
<i>accepting the fact</i>
<i>that he was gonna choose to die to...</i>

38:24.927 --> 38:27.096
<i>he's going for chemo.</i>

38:37.106 --> 38:41.944
[Grant] <i>It was 12 weeks of chemotherapy.</i>

38:44.238 --> 38:48.117
<i>I would get there at 5:30 in the morning,</i>
<i>take the chemotherapy.</i>

38:48.701 --> 38:51.746
<i>Then I would come back</i>
<i>to the restaurant, prep,</i>

38:51.829 --> 38:54.373
<i>go back down there for my second round...</i>

38:55.291 --> 38:58.085
<i>and then make my way up here for service.</i>

38:59.462 --> 39:01.839
<i>Physically, I was in pretty rough shape.</i>

39:03.924 --> 39:10.139
They radiated me
from the tip of my nose to my collarbone.

39:10.848 --> 39:13.726
It basically gave me a super bad sunburn.

39:15.519 --> 39:17.855
<i>And then that skin died.</i>

39:17.938 --> 39:19.857
<i>And then it shed.</i>

39:19.940 --> 39:24.945
So, literally, everything
just kind of got stripped away,

39:25.029 --> 39:26.989
including my taste buds.

39:29.158 --> 39:32.244
[Dave] <i>When Achatz</i>
<i>first went into treatment,</i>

39:32.328 --> 39:34.538
<i>he didn't believe</i>
<i>he was gonna lose his taste.</i>

39:35.581 --> 39:36.832
There were days
we were tasting stuff out,

39:36.916 --> 39:39.251
and all of a sudden he'd say,
"This needs way more salt."

39:39.335 --> 39:42.088
We'd all look at him and he'd be like,
"This has enough salt, doesn't it?"

39:42.171 --> 39:43.297
We'd be like, "Yes, Chef."

39:46.926 --> 39:49.220
[Grant] <i>I realized that I...</i>

39:49.804 --> 39:50.888
I couldn't taste.

39:55.226 --> 40:01.148
<i>All the charting and scans were showing</i>
<i>tumor size reduction.</i>

40:02.566 --> 40:08.739
But, the doctors couldn't tell me
with any certainty...

40:08.823 --> 40:10.825
that I would ever be able to taste again.

40:12.743 --> 40:16.997
<i>How can you be a chef?</i>
<i>How can you cook...</i>

40:17.081 --> 40:19.250
<i>and not be able to taste?</i>

40:20.751 --> 40:21.877
[Dave] <i>He was lost.</i>

40:22.962 --> 40:26.465
<i>The one thing that he did, he couldn't do.</i>

40:26.549 --> 40:29.260
<i>That was it.</i>
<i>That was his entire life there.</i>

40:36.892 --> 40:41.021
[Grant] <i>Everybody was fearful</i>
<i>that the restaurant would get really slow.</i>

40:42.857 --> 40:47.736
<i>I felt like I had to prove</i>
<i>that I was still in the game.</i>

40:49.363 --> 40:51.866
<i>I feel like the determination kicked in.</i>

40:51.949 --> 40:55.661
We need to keep showing people
that we're still innovating.

40:59.665 --> 41:04.211
[Dave] <i>He would sketch a dish on paper</i>
<i>and take a photo of it and send it to us.</i>

41:04.295 --> 41:07.381
<i>He'll be like, "Burnt bread pur√©e.</i>
<i>Make sure it's burnt.</i>

41:07.465 --> 41:10.634
<i>Season it with this acid,</i>
<i>but not too acidic."</i>

41:10.718 --> 41:12.219
<i>We'd go back and forth</i>
<i>on the scale of, like,</i>

41:12.303 --> 41:16.015
<i>"If a pickle's a five and bread's a one,</i>
<i>how acidic do you want it?"</i>

41:16.098 --> 41:19.435
<i>That, I found, was really</i>
<i>the best way to understand</i>

41:19.518 --> 41:21.395
what things should taste like.

41:24.356 --> 41:27.026
[Grant] <i>There was a light bulb</i>
<i>that went off and said...</i>

41:27.151 --> 41:29.778
<i>"For the first time ever,</i>
<i>I think I can be a chef</i>

41:29.862 --> 41:32.114
<i>without being able to taste.</i>

41:32.198 --> 41:35.534
Because it's up here.

41:35.618 --> 41:36.994
It's not here."

41:38.621 --> 41:40.164
[Dave] <i>This is gonna kind of sound weird,</i>

41:40.247 --> 41:43.667
<i>but I honestly think him being sick</i>
<i>taught him how to be a chef.</i>

41:44.752 --> 41:46.378
<i>Before, it was always he had to do it,</i>

41:46.462 --> 41:48.631
<i>and he would plate the dish</i>
<i>for the first week or two weeks</i>

41:48.714 --> 41:50.966
<i>before anyone was allowed to plate it.</i>

41:51.050 --> 41:54.261
Now he's creating food
without ever touching it.

41:55.262 --> 41:57.473
We can figure out something better.

41:57.556 --> 42:01.644
[Grant] <i>I realized that,</i>
<i>to make a world-class restaurant,</i>

42:01.727 --> 42:02.895
<i>you can't do it yourself.</i>

42:02.978 --> 42:06.148
<i>You have to take the voice</i>
<i>of all these people.</i>

42:07.441 --> 42:09.818
<i>So I said, "We need to engender this.</i>

42:09.902 --> 42:12.988
We shouldn't box it in.
We should blow it out."

42:13.864 --> 42:16.033
[indistinct chatter]

42:20.829 --> 42:25.125
<i>I remember sitting at the table</i>
<i>with the chefs, and I go,</i>

42:25.209 --> 42:29.922
<i>"Back in 2002,</i>
<i>I had this idea where we inflated</i>

42:30.005 --> 42:31.882
<i>a piece of cheese.</i>

42:31.966 --> 42:34.009
But what if this was floating?

42:34.093 --> 42:37.513
We should try to come up
with food that floats."

42:37.596 --> 42:40.849
And Mike just said, "I'll do that."

42:40.933 --> 42:44.228
And everybody else just went quiet
because they knew, like,

42:44.311 --> 42:49.316
"Wow, that's...
You're basically asking the impossible."

42:51.735 --> 42:55.197
[Mike] <i>In my opinion, the best medium</i>
<i>to make things float would be sugar.</i>

42:55.281 --> 42:59.243
<i>So I started playing around with sugar.</i>
<i>Different sugars, different ratios,</i>

42:59.326 --> 43:01.537
<i>and started to come up with something that</i>

43:01.620 --> 43:04.790
was semi-reasonable,
but didn't have any structure.

43:06.625 --> 43:08.043
<i>I could inflate sugar,</i>

43:08.127 --> 43:11.088
<i>but I couldn't actually get</i>
<i>beautiful shapes or anything.</i>

43:11.171 --> 43:13.215
They're actually
pretty horrific-looking shapes.

43:15.801 --> 43:18.429
<i>The key to it was making the sugar stable.</i>

43:21.557 --> 43:24.018
<i>Once we had just a combination of sugars,</i>

43:24.101 --> 43:26.812
<i>with some stabilizer,</i>
<i>at the right temperature,</i>

43:26.895 --> 43:29.690
it started to take shape across
the kitchen and it wasn't falling apart.

43:37.698 --> 43:41.243
<i>When we pulled the first balloon</i>
<i>and sat it down...</i>

43:41.327 --> 43:44.204
<i>we were like,</i>
<i>"Okay, this is a monumental achievement."</i>

43:46.790 --> 43:49.668
[Grant] <i>I said to Mike,</i>
<i>"As soon as that goes on the menu,</i>

43:49.752 --> 43:52.171
<i>that's an Alinea dish forever.</i>

43:52.254 --> 43:54.048
Are you okay with that?"

43:56.133 --> 43:57.343
[Mike] <i>I was like,</i>

43:57.426 --> 43:59.553
"This would be really cool
if I had created this for myself."

43:59.637 --> 44:00.679
[chuckles] Like, if I...

44:00.763 --> 44:03.599
Or maybe I shoulda held on
to this one for my own repertoire later.

44:04.683 --> 44:07.144
<i>But this is an Alinea dish now.</i>

44:12.274 --> 44:16.945
[Grant] <i>All chefs want to be known</i>
<i>for using a knife.</i>

44:17.029 --> 44:21.158
Cutting, creating, saut√©ing...
doing all of that.

44:23.452 --> 44:25.913
<i>But maybe that's not</i>
<i>the most important thing.</i>

44:25.996 --> 44:32.294
<i>Maybe the most important thing is</i>
<i>taking that idea, that little nugget...</i>

44:32.378 --> 44:34.713
<i>and handing it to someone else.</i>

44:34.797 --> 44:36.465
<i>And then next thing you know...</i>

44:37.007 --> 44:38.759
somebody's holding a balloon.

44:47.309 --> 44:50.479
[man] ...and two Graffiti.
That's ten now.

44:50.562 --> 44:54.274
Three deuces and a four-top by ten more...
One's an OL veg.

44:55.275 --> 44:59.446
[Grant] <i>I remember coming out</i>
<i>of the anesthesia after the surgery,</i>

44:59.530 --> 45:01.323
<i>where they took the biopsy.</i>

45:02.324 --> 45:05.035
<i>Dr. Blair said, "You're clean."</i>

45:06.870 --> 45:08.580
<i>I was cancer-free.</i>

45:13.043 --> 45:17.548
<i>A few weeks later, I wake up,</i>
<i>dumped a bunch of sugar in my coffee...</i>

45:17.631 --> 45:19.174
took a swig...

45:20.217 --> 45:24.680
and thought to myself, "God, it's sweet!

45:24.763 --> 45:26.432
It's really sweet."

45:26.515 --> 45:29.309
And then I put the cup down...

45:29.435 --> 45:32.771
kind of looked at it,
took another drink and was like...

45:33.730 --> 45:36.817
"Wow, I can taste sugar now.

45:36.900 --> 45:38.360
It's coming back."

45:43.282 --> 45:47.161
<i>A month later, I'm grabbing</i>
<i>three finger pinches of salt</i>

45:47.244 --> 45:49.496
<i>and just throwing 'em on my tongue...</i>

45:50.539 --> 45:52.708
and then I could taste salt.

45:55.002 --> 45:58.797
<i>It started to come back in waves.</i>

46:01.133 --> 46:03.260
<i>But the interesting thing was...</i>

46:04.678 --> 46:07.806
<i>when everything started</i>
<i>colliding together.</i>

46:16.607 --> 46:18.775
<i>When we're born,</i>

46:18.859 --> 46:22.571
<i>we have a very limited ability</i>
<i>to perceive flavor.</i>

46:24.448 --> 46:28.535
<i>And as you get older,</i>
<i>you're able to discern more.</i>

46:29.620 --> 46:33.540
<i>But you're so young, you're not</i>
<i>able to have that flavor memory.</i>

46:33.624 --> 46:36.627
<i>And you're not intelligent enough,</i>
<i>at that point,</i>

46:36.710 --> 46:41.423
<i>to figure out how</i>
<i>all of those things work in synergy.</i>

46:42.174 --> 46:45.886
I got to experience that as a 33-year-old.

46:47.971 --> 46:49.765
<i>To me, it was revelatory.</i>

46:49.848 --> 46:55.103
To me, it was like...
my whole world just changed, as a chef.

46:57.189 --> 47:00.901
<i>I was on fire with...</i>

47:01.026 --> 47:05.364
<i>an amount of energy</i>
<i>that I think I've never had before...</i>

47:06.031 --> 47:10.619
<i>because I got a second chance</i>
<i>and I didn't want to screw it up.</i>

48:25.527 --> 48:30.032
[Grant] <i>After I got better,</i>
<i>I was concerned that people were gonna</i>

48:30.115 --> 48:33.619
only know who I was because I had this...

48:33.702 --> 48:35.954
ironic health scare.

48:37.623 --> 48:41.209
<i>I was labeled,</i>
<i>"The chef that couldn't taste."</i>

48:42.836 --> 48:47.257
<i>But now we have the opportunity</i>
<i>to make a very solid break</i>

48:47.341 --> 48:48.925
<i>and start again.</i>

49:04.441 --> 49:09.279
[Nick] <i>There's a need</i>
<i>to feel alive in anybody.</i>

49:09.363 --> 49:11.406
<i>And the way that it works</i>
<i>for Grant is that,</i>

49:11.490 --> 49:15.369
<i>he works at something, works at something,</i>
<i>works at something, creates it...</i>

49:15.452 --> 49:19.998
<i>He goes, "Oh, now I need to go</i>
<i>do something radically different."</i>

49:20.082 --> 49:22.084
<i>And new is</i>

49:22.167 --> 49:27.297
a way of feeling like
he's propelling himself forward.

49:30.759 --> 49:34.429
Imagine if you have
a wall covered with canvas

49:34.513 --> 49:37.307
and we threw sauces on it.

49:37.391 --> 49:38.809
And then they came up

49:38.892 --> 49:42.854
and scrape the sauces off
with their spoon, right?

49:42.938 --> 49:44.940
We wouldn't do that.

49:45.023 --> 49:48.276
But is there a way
to think about it like that?

49:48.360 --> 49:50.404
[Dave] <i>There have been times</i>
<i>where we've literally looked at him</i>

49:50.487 --> 49:52.280
<i>and he's been like,</i>
<i>"You know what? Scrap all those dishes.</i>

49:52.364 --> 49:54.032
<i>Just get rid of them all."</i>
<i>And you're like,</i>

49:54.116 --> 49:56.910
"This is good. What are you...
Why are we getting rid of this?"

49:57.744 --> 50:00.664
<i>With him, there's always the hunt</i>
<i>for, like, "What's the cooler plate?</i>

50:00.747 --> 50:02.541
<i>What's the better plate up?</i>
<i>What's the better ingredient?</i>

50:02.624 --> 50:04.543
<i>Where's the better place to go?</i>

50:04.626 --> 50:06.128
What's the better thing to do?"

50:07.462 --> 50:08.797
[Grant] What if you went like this?

50:09.506 --> 50:10.716
Get the smoke going

50:10.799 --> 50:13.385
and then pour the cocktail base
and it would just...

50:13.468 --> 50:16.555
-That... that should be the new decanter.
-Exactly.

50:16.638 --> 50:19.057
-That should be the new decanter.
-Seriously. Right.

50:19.141 --> 50:22.269
[Francis] <i>We talk about creativity</i>
<i>and we talk about innovation.</i>

50:22.352 --> 50:24.438
<i>That's at the core of what Grant does.</i>

50:24.521 --> 50:27.274
We wanna lionize him
and romanticize him for that.

50:27.357 --> 50:29.025
But you can't be creative
and you can't be innovative

50:29.109 --> 50:30.277
without being risky.

50:31.194 --> 50:36.158
<i>That's the thing that's also</i>
<i>so interesting and so dangerous.</i>

50:36.241 --> 50:40.495
<i>Because now they've done so much</i>
<i>for ten years on.</i>

50:40.579 --> 50:45.083
<i>What can you keep doing that's new,</i>
<i>that people will still like?</i>

50:45.167 --> 50:49.004
<i>And will you destroy yourself</i>
<i>or destroy your reputation,</i>

50:49.087 --> 50:53.133
<i>or destroy the restaurant as a business...</i>

50:53.216 --> 50:55.761
<i>in the pursuit of doing something new?</i>

50:57.304 --> 51:01.183
How are you gonna know?
How are you gonna know if it's gonna work?

51:03.226 --> 51:06.730
[Grant] The whole idea
with this layout is to...

51:06.813 --> 51:10.609
make this a room that is like a chameleon.

51:10.734 --> 51:12.569
I mean, this is what
we've all been talking about.

51:13.945 --> 51:18.158
We're closing
the restaurant in January to renovate,

51:18.241 --> 51:20.202
and, obviously, use that downtime

51:20.285 --> 51:23.413
to learn and create new techniques
and a new style of serving.

51:24.581 --> 51:29.878
[Grant] <i>We're ripping apart a restaurant</i>
<i>that is working incredibly well.</i>

51:30.712 --> 51:33.215
<i>It's the busiest it's ever been.</i>

51:33.298 --> 51:36.259
<i>Why fix something that's not broken?</i>

51:36.343 --> 51:42.224
<i>Well, because if we're wholeheartedly</i>
<i>gonna uphold that philosophy</i>

51:42.307 --> 51:45.143
<i>that we started ten years ago...</i>

51:45.227 --> 51:48.271
<i>"The beginning of</i>
<i>a new train of thought..."</i>

51:49.606 --> 51:52.776
<i>I feel like that's our obligation.</i>

51:55.362 --> 51:58.615
<i>We have to just make it a clean slate.</i>

52:01.451 --> 52:03.411
<i>Now, we're asking ourselves...</i>

52:04.913 --> 52:09.417
<i>"Can we eliminate what we've been doing</i>
<i>for the last ten years...</i>

52:11.086 --> 52:13.213
and start over?"

52:13.296 --> 52:16.049
And, uh... the answer is, "Yeah."
