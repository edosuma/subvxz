WEBVTT

00:01.601 --> 00:02.703
SHORE: Previously
on The Practice...

00:02.735 --> 00:04.571
I'd love to submit your name
to the governor's counsel.

00:04.605 --> 00:06.507
To be a superior court judge?

00:06.540 --> 00:08.675
Oh, you're acting like
I don't have the right to leave,

00:08.709 --> 00:09.576
like I owe you--
I never said--

00:09.610 --> 00:10.744
I have the right.

00:12.546 --> 00:15.081
I've always wanted
to hang my own shingle.

00:15.115 --> 00:15.949
When would you do this?

00:15.982 --> 00:17.483
It needs to be now.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.319
I talked to my friend
at the bureau.

00:19.352 --> 00:20.486
Your ass wasn't bugged.

00:20.521 --> 00:21.922
What did you expect
that they were gonna--

00:21.955 --> 00:23.924
I think it's possible
she flipped you, Manny.

00:23.957 --> 00:24.825
Gigi?

00:24.858 --> 00:26.827
BERLUTI: I know you love Manny.

00:26.860 --> 00:30.096
But you got to tell me
how you were coerced.

00:30.130 --> 00:31.998
PAPONI: This is Lenny Pescatore.

00:32.031 --> 00:34.134
How can I help you?
I'm a neighborhood lawyer, too.

00:34.167 --> 00:35.268
Only problem...

00:36.369 --> 00:39.005
I'm the neighborhood lawyer.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.775
SHORE: I thought
you were absolutely...

00:41.808 --> 00:43.977
sensational up
on that bar.

00:49.215 --> 00:50.984
Well, that was surprising.

00:51.017 --> 00:53.086
I kissed you.

00:53.119 --> 00:54.821
It was totally inappropriate.

00:54.855 --> 00:57.658
I have this way
of making women feel...

00:59.025 --> 01:01.134
wonderful, but...

01:02.669 --> 01:04.037
less than, in the end.

01:04.069 --> 01:05.906
Maybe you haven't met
the right girl.

01:05.939 --> 01:07.473
Perhaps.

01:07.508 --> 01:09.242
I think you like me.

01:09.275 --> 01:11.144
Shh.

01:13.179 --> 01:14.881
HEEP: Alan, hold up. Yo.

01:14.915 --> 01:16.216
Did you just say, "Yo"?

01:16.249 --> 01:17.383
I'm very upset.

01:17.417 --> 01:19.019
I thought we had a kind of,

01:19.052 --> 01:20.854
you know, thing going.

01:20.887 --> 01:21.922
A thing?

01:21.955 --> 01:23.824
Yes, a thing--we kissed.
that's a--

01:23.857 --> 01:24.758
You kissed.

01:24.791 --> 01:26.760
And you received,
and we danced.

01:26.793 --> 01:27.961
You grabbed my ass.

01:27.994 --> 01:30.631
You saluted my quest
to be myself--

01:30.664 --> 01:32.999
that, at least, adds up
to a potential thing

01:33.033 --> 01:34.501
that needs to be dealt with.

01:34.535 --> 01:35.936
SHORE:
Sally, when I told you

01:35.969 --> 01:37.704
I was attracted
to professional women,

01:37.738 --> 01:40.040
I truly meant...

01:40.073 --> 01:41.542
professional women.

01:42.408 --> 01:43.677
I'm not accepting that.

01:45.211 --> 01:46.547
You're not accepting it.

01:47.581 --> 01:48.849
You like me.

01:48.882 --> 01:51.017
I can always tell
when a man has feelings for me.

01:51.051 --> 01:53.319
I don't care how much you try
to kid yourself.

01:53.353 --> 01:54.521
You're not fooling me.

02:04.771 --> 02:05.939
CRANE: Tara...

02:05.972 --> 02:06.907
Denny Crane.

02:06.940 --> 02:08.174
I am ahead of you there.

02:08.208 --> 02:10.175
Wonderful news,
I had breakfast this morning.

02:10.210 --> 02:12.646
You must be
beside yourself.

02:12.679 --> 02:14.748
Oh, no, that's not the news.

02:14.781 --> 02:16.382
Had breakfast this morning

02:16.416 --> 02:19.519
with general counsel
of perhaps one of the leading

02:19.553 --> 02:21.121
car manufacturers
of this country,

02:21.154 --> 02:22.255
know who that is?

02:22.288 --> 02:23.423
America?

02:23.456 --> 02:26.092
We're taking over
their SUV cases,

02:26.126 --> 02:27.561
which is beyond huge.

02:28.161 --> 02:29.262
I want Hannah, Alan,

02:29.295 --> 02:31.898
you, of course,
in my office at 1400 hours.

02:31.932 --> 02:32.933
Aye, aye.

02:32.966 --> 02:34.801
Denny Crane.

02:41.474 --> 02:45.245
(music playing)

03:20.053 --> 03:21.955
I'm not gonna tell you
your business, Jimmy,

03:21.988 --> 03:23.890
because I know
that's not my place,

03:23.924 --> 03:25.726
but you got to stand up
to this guy.

03:25.759 --> 03:26.527
I did.

03:26.560 --> 03:27.928
No, you didn't.

03:27.961 --> 03:29.029
Manny did.

03:29.062 --> 03:30.230
You didn't do anything.

03:30.263 --> 03:32.232
And what should I
have done, Suzy?

03:32.265 --> 03:34.901
PAPONI: Again, not my place,

03:34.935 --> 03:36.803
but this is the street.

03:36.837 --> 03:40.040
It's not some fancy
Beacon Hill Office.

03:40.073 --> 03:41.174
I asked around.

03:41.207 --> 03:43.309
That fat slob
has bullied every lawyer

03:43.343 --> 03:44.210
that's tried to come in here,

03:44.244 --> 03:46.179
and he intimidates clients, too.

03:46.913 --> 03:48.048
I talked to my mother.

03:48.081 --> 03:49.550
She says he's a coward.

03:50.216 --> 03:51.518
COLEY: Excuse me, Jimmy?

03:53.253 --> 03:55.088
Excuse me.

03:55.121 --> 03:56.990
Look, I've been playing
this interrogation thing

03:57.023 --> 03:58.358
over and over
in my head, Jimmy,

03:58.391 --> 04:00.026
and, well...

04:00.060 --> 04:02.268
I think maybe
the police did coerce me.

04:02.302 --> 04:04.571
I mean, what I said
wasn't totally voluntary.

04:06.840 --> 04:07.841
Okay.

04:07.874 --> 04:09.409
How so?

04:09.442 --> 04:10.711
Well...

04:10.744 --> 04:11.845
they attached these tiny,

04:11.878 --> 04:14.280
little electrode thingies
to my privates,

04:14.314 --> 04:15.816
and they would zap me

04:15.849 --> 04:17.183
if they didn't like
my answers.

04:17.216 --> 04:19.351
It made me react
all involuntary.

04:19.385 --> 04:20.521
I...

04:23.557 --> 04:25.058
What?

04:25.091 --> 04:27.127
Manny told you to say this.

04:27.160 --> 04:28.128
COLEY: He said they torture,

04:28.161 --> 04:29.195
that they're doing
this kind of thing

04:29.229 --> 04:30.931
in the Guatemala bay area.

04:30.964 --> 04:32.265
Guantanamo Bay.

04:33.432 --> 04:34.433
Gigi...

04:34.467 --> 04:36.803
I am not going to lie.

04:36.836 --> 04:39.405
If the day comes
I decide to lie,

04:39.438 --> 04:42.809
it won't be with one of Manny's
ridiculous concoctions.

04:42.843 --> 04:44.077
I love him, Jimmy,

04:44.110 --> 04:45.979
and, well,
he won't take me back,

04:46.012 --> 04:48.014
and if you can get this thing
to go away,

04:48.048 --> 04:51.051
well, then, maybe I can get him
to forgive me.

04:55.856 --> 04:57.958
STADLER: I just think
you should have counsel.

04:57.991 --> 04:59.325
YOUNG: The commission wants
to hear from me,

04:59.359 --> 05:00.466
not my attorney.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.202
Plus, you can advise me
if I need help.

05:02.235 --> 05:04.370
No, I cannot.
I'm on the nominating committee.

05:04.404 --> 05:05.906
It would be total--
YOUNG: Uh...

05:05.939 --> 05:07.473
advise me now, then.

05:08.474 --> 05:10.376
All right.

05:10.410 --> 05:12.278
It could get very political.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.147
The main thing for you
is to impress them

05:14.180 --> 05:16.449
with the idea
that you will uphold the law.

05:16.482 --> 05:17.884
As a defense attorney,

05:17.918 --> 05:19.319
you could be viewed as being

05:19.352 --> 05:21.354
potentially soft on crime.

05:21.387 --> 05:24.124
You do not want
to be viewed that way.

05:25.358 --> 05:26.660
I could come with you.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.995
STADLER: I think
that would be very wise.

05:29.663 --> 05:30.931
Also...

05:30.964 --> 05:32.465
the death penalty...

05:33.166 --> 05:33.967
What about it?

05:34.000 --> 05:34.768
STADLER: If it comes up--

05:34.801 --> 05:36.136
and it may,

05:36.169 --> 05:37.504
you'll have to finesse this.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.673
Romney is looking
to impose it.

05:39.706 --> 05:40.607
And what?

05:40.641 --> 05:42.275
I'm required
to agree with that?

05:42.308 --> 05:43.043
STADLER: No.

05:43.076 --> 05:44.144
You simply say

05:44.177 --> 05:46.079
that you're bound
to uphold the law,

05:46.112 --> 05:48.014
that, as a judge,
you will uphold the law,

05:48.048 --> 05:48.915
and get out.

05:50.416 --> 05:52.218
This is critical, Eugene.

05:52.252 --> 05:55.656
Is finesse
in your arsenal?

06:00.133 --> 06:01.001
CRANE: The first thing
we need to do

06:01.034 --> 06:02.869
is develop a strategy.

06:02.903 --> 06:04.905
These vehicles still roll.

06:04.938 --> 06:08.775
It's a growth industry,
and I want to capture it.

06:08.809 --> 06:10.711
We need a strategy.
Hannah...

06:10.744 --> 06:13.013
I'd like you to come up
with an overall--

06:13.547 --> 06:14.615
what's the word?

06:14.648 --> 06:15.549
Strategy?

06:15.582 --> 06:16.517
Exactly.

06:17.317 --> 06:19.185
Alan, turns out...

06:19.219 --> 06:22.222
our first case comes up
for trial in June.

06:23.289 --> 06:24.691
your former colleague
is handling it,

06:25.592 --> 06:27.828
that big-boned woman
from your old firm,

06:27.861 --> 06:29.029
the one that scares me.

06:29.062 --> 06:30.163
Ellenor Frutt.

06:30.196 --> 06:31.097
CRANE: Mmm.

06:31.131 --> 06:32.566
Our client...

06:32.599 --> 06:34.134
will no doubt be evaluating us

06:34.167 --> 06:35.468
in this first case.

06:35.502 --> 06:36.803
I'd like you to take it,

06:36.837 --> 06:38.572
since--
SHORE: I'm afraid I can't.

06:39.873 --> 06:40.774
Why not?

06:40.807 --> 06:41.775
Ellenor's a friend.

06:41.808 --> 06:43.610
I'm not trying cases
against her.

06:43.644 --> 06:45.111
CRANE: Son...

06:45.145 --> 06:46.880
success is never so sweet

06:46.913 --> 06:48.849
as when we can crush a friend
in the process.

06:48.882 --> 06:50.016
Just the same.

06:51.151 --> 06:52.753
Hannah...

06:52.786 --> 06:53.954
you don't have friends,
do you?

06:54.387 --> 06:56.122
None.
Excellent.

06:56.156 --> 06:57.958
Tara, see that Hannah gets
what she needs.

06:57.991 --> 07:00.366
I believe that covers it.
Anything else?

07:00.400 --> 07:01.735
Your name.

07:01.768 --> 07:03.403
Oh, yes.

07:05.438 --> 07:06.406
Denny Crane.

07:08.241 --> 07:09.375
Dismissed.

07:11.411 --> 07:12.345
BERLUTI: Manny...

07:12.378 --> 07:13.213
QUINN: I can't go flipping

07:13.246 --> 07:14.615
Charlie Andretti, Jimmy.

07:14.648 --> 07:16.049
I mean, we need to come up
with a solution

07:16.082 --> 07:17.417
that allows me
to go on living.

07:17.450 --> 07:20.320
I will not be saying
the Feds attached electrodes

07:20.353 --> 07:22.122
to your girlfriend's genitalia.

07:22.155 --> 07:23.423
Now, stop being an idiot!

07:25.892 --> 07:26.660
I'm sorry.

07:26.693 --> 07:27.828
I didn't mean that.

07:27.861 --> 07:29.763
You know I got labeling issues.

07:30.463 --> 07:31.532
I'm sorry.

07:32.833 --> 07:35.502
She wants you back,
you know, Gigi.

07:35.536 --> 07:36.637
Ohh.

07:36.670 --> 07:38.204
Manny, sometimes,

07:38.238 --> 07:41.708
the toughest thing in the world
to do is forgive.

07:41.742 --> 07:44.477
And sometimes,
the more you love somebody,

07:44.511 --> 07:45.646
the harder it is.

07:45.679 --> 07:47.413
What are you? "Dear Abby" now?

07:50.450 --> 07:51.417
BERLUTI: Spinny...

07:52.185 --> 07:53.486
what happened to your head?

07:53.520 --> 07:54.788
Ten guesses.

07:55.556 --> 07:57.157
The fish?
SPINNY: Not personally,

07:57.190 --> 07:59.225
but his name did come up
between kicks.

08:01.067 --> 08:02.268
I got to fire you, Jimmy.

08:02.302 --> 08:04.805
Spinny, I will talk to him.

08:04.838 --> 08:06.072
He's got me by the cogliones.

08:06.106 --> 08:08.308
I'm in to him (indistinct)
for $2,500 plus juice.

08:08.341 --> 08:09.676
He's juicing you?

08:09.710 --> 08:10.944
A point and a half.

08:11.512 --> 08:13.046
Does he do this with everybody?

08:13.079 --> 08:14.480
Hey, if I borrowed
from a loan shark,

08:14.515 --> 08:16.650
I'd be paying
five points a week,

08:16.683 --> 08:18.351
that's, of course,
if I was to pay him.

08:20.220 --> 08:21.454
Suzy...

08:21.487 --> 08:23.557
cancel this afternoon's
appointments.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.826
What appointments?
People just walk in here.

08:29.229 --> 08:31.064
WARTON: Do you see yourself
bringing any particular

08:31.097 --> 08:33.332
judicial philosophy
to the bench?

08:33.366 --> 08:34.967
YOUNG: I would like
to see the courts

08:35.001 --> 08:36.336
and specifically, judges,

08:36.369 --> 08:37.837
show respect for the law.

08:37.871 --> 08:39.873
Do you think
that's currently a problem?

08:39.905 --> 08:40.874
YOUNG: A big one.

08:40.907 --> 08:42.308
We've got overcrowded dockets,

08:42.342 --> 08:43.744
and more and more judges

08:43.777 --> 08:45.812
are becoming slaves
to expediency.

08:45.846 --> 08:47.047
More and more,
the constitution

08:47.080 --> 08:48.882
is being molded
and manipulated

08:48.915 --> 08:51.752
to fit a judge's political
or moral point of view.

08:52.919 --> 08:54.287
It has to stop.

08:54.320 --> 08:56.122
HALBERRY: I can see
your firm has handled

08:56.156 --> 08:58.391
several capital cases
out of state,

08:58.424 --> 09:02.002
each time taking a position
against the death penalty.

09:04.137 --> 09:05.639
We're a defense firm.

09:05.672 --> 09:08.875
Our clients tend
to disfavor being executed.

09:10.043 --> 09:11.377
Fair enough,

09:11.411 --> 09:14.014
but as a judge, would you impose
the death penalty,

09:14.047 --> 09:16.517
should it ever become law
in this state?

09:17.183 --> 09:18.118
No.

09:18.151 --> 09:19.553
HALBERRY: Why not?

09:19.586 --> 09:21.087
YOUNG:
One, I consider human life

09:21.121 --> 09:22.823
to be intrinsically sacred,

09:22.856 --> 09:24.891
and I do not believe
the state should engage

09:24.925 --> 09:27.928
in the systemized
taking of human life.

09:27.961 --> 09:28.962
Two...

09:28.995 --> 09:31.097
our judicial system
is flawed.

09:31.131 --> 09:34.467
We wrongly convict
over 10,000 people a year,

09:34.500 --> 09:37.170
some of whom
are sentenced to die.

09:37.203 --> 09:40.206
Now, you can always release
an exonerated man from prison,

09:40.240 --> 09:41.608
but bringing him back from death

09:41.642 --> 09:43.143
has proven to be trickier.

09:43.176 --> 09:45.646
DNA has already cleared 100 men,

09:45.679 --> 09:47.280
many on death row.

09:47.313 --> 09:50.050
Clearly, something
isn't working.

09:50.083 --> 09:52.252
WARTON: And what would you say,
Mr. Young,

09:52.285 --> 09:53.820
to the mother
whose five-year-old daughter

09:53.854 --> 09:56.289
has been raped and murdered?

09:59.660 --> 10:00.801
I would say,

10:00.834 --> 10:02.435
if it were my daughter,

10:02.468 --> 10:05.739
I'd like to kill
whoever did it myself.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.774
And if I ever came
face-to-face with the guy,

10:07.808 --> 10:09.342
I couldn't guarantee
any of you

10:09.375 --> 10:11.011
that I wouldn't kill him.

10:11.645 --> 10:12.846
But if I did...

10:12.879 --> 10:14.915
it would be wrong,

10:14.948 --> 10:16.683
and for the state
to kill reflectively,

10:16.717 --> 10:18.752
absent emotion, on ceremony

10:18.785 --> 10:20.286
it is not right.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.454
And if I might add

10:21.487 --> 10:23.724
one of the biggest problems
we have today

10:23.757 --> 10:25.626
our children are being raised
in a culture

10:25.659 --> 10:27.994
that not only condones revenge,

10:28.028 --> 10:29.930
but, perhaps, even celebrates it

10:29.963 --> 10:32.098
as a societal good.

10:33.700 --> 10:34.968
It's wrong.

10:52.385 --> 10:54.387
I don't understand, Eugene.

10:54.420 --> 10:56.422
Do you not want
to be confirmed?

10:56.456 --> 10:57.991
I want to be confirmed
for who I am,

10:58.024 --> 11:00.333
not who they want me to be.
FRUTT: Come on.

11:00.366 --> 11:02.669
You can't possibly be
so pigheaded that you--

11:02.703 --> 11:03.737
What did you say?

11:03.770 --> 11:05.371
Eugene...

11:05.405 --> 11:08.975
can we please have
an honest conversation here?

11:09.009 --> 11:11.411
Do you want
this judgeship or not?

11:15.448 --> 11:16.482
(sighs)

11:18.151 --> 11:19.485
I want it desperately.

11:20.587 --> 11:22.022
Then why behave--

11:23.890 --> 11:25.592
I truly don't get it.

11:26.927 --> 11:28.829
My brother went to jail
for a crime he didn't do

11:28.862 --> 11:30.631
you know this.

11:30.664 --> 11:31.632
He died in prison.

11:31.665 --> 11:32.899
And...

11:34.668 --> 11:36.737
Well, and, since that day,
I made a vow...

11:37.771 --> 11:40.106
the best way
to fix the justice system

11:40.140 --> 11:42.909
is up there, on the bench,
and...

11:42.943 --> 11:45.278
I think the reason
I want it so bad, Ellenor,

11:45.311 --> 11:48.749
is because it's the same thing
that makes me so angry,

11:48.782 --> 11:50.450
when I think of what happened
to my brother, and--

11:50.483 --> 11:51.985
FRUTT: Then get there, Eugene.

11:52.018 --> 11:53.920
Get there for your brother.

11:55.856 --> 11:56.957
(knocks on door)

11:58.291 --> 11:59.459
ROSE: Hello.

11:59.492 --> 12:01.668
Uh, I'm looking
for Ellenor Frutt.

12:01.702 --> 12:03.069
I'm Ellenor Frutt.

12:05.005 --> 12:06.006
Hi.

12:06.039 --> 12:07.173
I'm Hannah Rose.

12:07.207 --> 12:09.009
We just took over
the Lansing Motors case.

12:09.042 --> 12:10.977
We now represent
the defendant.

12:11.011 --> 12:12.012
Oh.

12:12.045 --> 12:13.714
I'm from Crane,
Pool, &amp; Schmidt,

12:13.747 --> 12:16.382
where Alan Shore works.

12:16.416 --> 12:18.051
And, well, I know
things ended badly

12:18.084 --> 12:20.654
between Alan and this firm,

12:20.687 --> 12:21.888
and I thought
to avoid getting off

12:21.922 --> 12:23.056
on an acrimonious foot,

12:23.089 --> 12:26.259
I'd just come by
and introduce myself.

12:26.292 --> 12:28.762
Actually,
Alan and I remain friends.

12:28.795 --> 12:30.697
Oh, well,
that's a relief to know.

12:30.731 --> 12:32.999
I am not a huge fan
of contention.

12:33.033 --> 12:35.736
And you chose a career
in litigation.

12:35.769 --> 12:39.072
I look at it more
as dispute resolution.

12:39.105 --> 12:40.273
Anyway, toward that end,

12:40.306 --> 12:41.508
I was reviewing your motion

12:41.542 --> 12:43.176
to compel production
of documents.

12:43.209 --> 12:45.612
I believe prior counsel
was a little withholding,

12:45.646 --> 12:46.947
as you suspected,

12:46.980 --> 12:49.482
and I intend to have
all documents delivered

12:49.516 --> 12:50.851
by the close of business.

12:54.154 --> 12:54.855
Thank you.

12:56.356 --> 12:58.491
Anyway,
it was nice to meet you.

13:03.804 --> 13:05.171
(door opens)

13:10.977 --> 13:12.646
She seemed nice.

13:15.348 --> 13:16.249
Alan...

13:16.282 --> 13:18.151
yo, again.

13:19.052 --> 13:20.020
Tonight's lousy for me.

13:20.053 --> 13:22.422
Hannah assigned me some research
on the SUV case,

13:22.455 --> 13:24.357
so we'll have to make it
tomorrow night.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.294
Make what tomorrow night?

13:28.328 --> 13:30.330
Our dinner.

13:30.363 --> 13:31.832
Didn't I tell you
we were having dinner?

13:32.533 --> 13:34.300
No, Sally,
you forgot to mention that.

13:35.001 --> 13:36.670
Well, now you know.

13:40.206 --> 13:41.808
Wait a second.

13:41.842 --> 13:42.876
Yo!

13:45.779 --> 13:46.580
I swear,

13:46.613 --> 13:48.815
I had nothing to do with that.

13:49.883 --> 13:51.151
WILSON: Go to dinner
with her, Alan.

13:52.485 --> 13:54.855
Uh, I thought you wanted me
to ask you to dinner.

13:54.888 --> 13:56.690
Perhaps I do,

13:56.723 --> 13:58.291
but I'm speaking
in your interests now,

13:58.324 --> 13:59.425
and your interests

13:59.459 --> 14:00.867
seem to lie with her.

14:00.901 --> 14:03.003
Don't be ridiculous.
She's a child.

14:03.036 --> 14:04.237
It would be a violation
of my parole

14:04.270 --> 14:05.572
to have dinner with her.

14:05.606 --> 14:08.174
You see,
here's what you need to know

14:08.208 --> 14:09.843
is that you like her

14:09.876 --> 14:12.178
and you don't like yourself.

14:12.212 --> 14:15.081
With her,
you get to remake yourself...

14:16.950 --> 14:18.418
at least somewhat.

14:21.254 --> 14:23.156
I thought you wanted me
to ask you to dinner.

14:34.400 --> 14:36.169
EILEEN: All right,
I'll give him the message.

14:37.738 --> 14:38.905
Is he in there?

14:38.939 --> 14:40.040
He's with a client.

14:40.073 --> 14:41.341
BERLUTI: Tell him Jimmy Berluti
is out here,

14:41.374 --> 14:42.843
and he's very angry.

14:42.876 --> 14:44.878
I know who you are.

14:44.911 --> 14:46.346
PESCATORE: Go on.

14:46.379 --> 14:47.714
I'll call you
if I hear anything.

14:47.748 --> 14:49.082
MAN: Thanks, Len.

14:50.116 --> 14:51.017
You got an appointment?

14:51.051 --> 14:52.586
I just saw Spinny.

14:52.619 --> 14:53.587
Good for you.

14:53.620 --> 14:55.556
Who's next?
Mr. Terranova.

14:55.589 --> 14:57.724
BERLUTI: He's got seven stitches
above his eye.

14:57.758 --> 15:00.901
Some people
shouldn't drink and walk.

15:00.934 --> 15:02.302
Come on in, Mr. Terranova.

15:02.335 --> 15:03.737
BERLUTI: What kind
of a lawyer are you?

15:03.770 --> 15:05.271
You're supposed
to be helping people, not--

15:05.305 --> 15:06.406
Look...

15:06.439 --> 15:07.908
I'd like to hear you
pontificate,

15:07.941 --> 15:09.242
but, as you can see,

15:09.275 --> 15:12.012
I've got clients
to take care of.

15:12.045 --> 15:13.179
Do they know
that you charge interest

15:13.213 --> 15:15.048
on what they can't pay up front?

15:17.851 --> 15:18.685
Here.

15:18.719 --> 15:20.621
Whatever he's charging you,

15:20.654 --> 15:22.455
I'll do it for half.

15:22.488 --> 15:23.223
Rocco!

15:23.256 --> 15:24.958
BERLUTI: No juice.

15:24.991 --> 15:27.193
PESCATORE: Okay, everybody out.

15:27.227 --> 15:28.128
Come back in an hour.

15:28.161 --> 15:28.962
WOMAN: Why?

15:28.995 --> 15:30.096
Vermin infestation.

15:30.130 --> 15:32.032
Come on, let's go, andiamo.

15:32.065 --> 15:33.867
What about my appointment?

15:33.900 --> 15:35.068
We plead no contest.

15:35.101 --> 15:37.103
You pay the fine and me,
it all goes away.

15:40.874 --> 15:41.908
What are you doing?

15:41.942 --> 15:43.610
Eileen, wait in the office.

15:43.644 --> 15:45.411
Lenny...
Now!

15:45.445 --> 15:46.747
And close the door.

15:46.780 --> 15:48.048
BERLUTI: Raise a finger,

15:48.081 --> 15:49.516
and I'll have you
before the BBO

15:49.550 --> 15:51.151
before you can light
your next cigar.

15:51.184 --> 15:52.318
We'll see
how much speech you got

15:52.352 --> 15:53.319
when your jaw is wired.

15:54.888 --> 15:56.590
BERLUTI:
Wait, just wait a second.

15:56.623 --> 15:57.991
I want to be perfectly clear

15:58.024 --> 15:59.459
as to what's
about to happen here.

15:59.492 --> 16:00.634
You haven't been away
from the neighborhood

16:00.667 --> 16:01.568
that long, Jimmy.

16:01.602 --> 16:02.936
You know
what's about to happen.

16:02.969 --> 16:04.805
Get him.
Ohh!

16:04.838 --> 16:06.106
PESCATORE:
You're a dead man, Jimmy!

16:06.139 --> 16:07.207
You're dead!

16:07.240 --> 16:09.543
You don't know
who messed with!

16:10.944 --> 16:12.312
RICHMOND:
Now, where I'm troubled

16:12.345 --> 16:13.680
in your own firm,

16:13.714 --> 16:16.817
if I'm to believe statements
made by you under oath,

16:17.383 --> 16:21.087
you had an attorney who engaged
in egregiously unethical,

16:21.121 --> 16:23.289
if not criminal, conduct.

16:23.323 --> 16:25.592
I assume you're referring
to Alan Shore.

16:26.527 --> 16:28.361
Concealing evidence,

16:28.394 --> 16:30.130
blackmail, extortion,

16:30.163 --> 16:31.598
assuming false identities,

16:31.632 --> 16:33.634
suborning perjury.

16:33.667 --> 16:36.002
We certainly
did not authorize Mr. Shore

16:36.036 --> 16:37.771
to commit these infractions.

16:37.804 --> 16:40.774
But you let it go on?
YOUNG: No.

16:40.807 --> 16:41.708
No.

16:41.742 --> 16:42.843
We fired him.

16:42.876 --> 16:45.145
After several months
of this behavior,

16:45.178 --> 16:47.648
after profiting
from this conduct,

16:47.681 --> 16:49.783
profit in the amount
of $9 million.

16:49.816 --> 16:52.152
Now, that's dirty money,
Mr. Young.

16:52.185 --> 16:53.754
We attempted to sanction
Mr. Shore's behavior

16:53.787 --> 16:54.721
many times, and--

16:54.755 --> 16:55.789
But you let it go on,

16:55.822 --> 16:57.558
and only after you got rich

16:57.591 --> 16:59.292
from this unethical behavior,

16:59.325 --> 17:02.002
only then did you attempt
to shut it down.

17:02.035 --> 17:03.036
That is totally false!

17:03.069 --> 17:04.905
And maybe this would be
a good time to point out

17:04.938 --> 17:06.406
that, if I were
to become a judge,

17:06.439 --> 17:08.909
my style would be
to hear evidence

17:08.942 --> 17:10.977
before I started
making conclusions,

17:11.512 --> 17:13.847
especially the unfounded kind.

17:17.349 --> 17:18.984
You seem to have a temper.

17:25.224 --> 17:26.560
It's over, Ellenor.

17:27.728 --> 17:29.329
FRUTT: Not necessarily,

17:29.362 --> 17:31.264
especially with that
positive attitude.

17:31.297 --> 17:34.334
YOUNG: The idea that
they want me for a judge

17:34.367 --> 17:36.302
with everything
that's going on at our firm.

17:38.004 --> 17:39.673
Your personal reputation has--

17:39.706 --> 17:41.174
Look, don't handle me, please.

17:41.207 --> 17:42.543
If this is about your brother

17:42.576 --> 17:44.511
and vindicating
an injustice done to him,

17:44.545 --> 17:46.212
then rise up with your best
in that room.

17:46.246 --> 17:47.213
You haven't done that yet.

17:47.247 --> 17:49.382
Whatever I say is self-serving.

17:50.951 --> 17:52.118
Let's forget it.

17:58.725 --> 18:01.201
What in God's name...

18:02.836 --> 18:03.837
(thumping)

18:05.639 --> 18:08.241
Document production
on the SUV case,

18:08.274 --> 18:10.243
and this isn't all.

18:10.276 --> 18:11.377
Storage is full, too.

18:17.250 --> 18:18.619
BERLUTI:
What was I supposed to do?

18:18.652 --> 18:20.687
There was two of them,
one of me.

18:20.721 --> 18:22.388
Plus, they were bigger.

18:22.422 --> 18:23.657
It's just pepper spray.

18:23.690 --> 18:25.125
I mean, it's kind
of feminine, Jimmy.

18:25.158 --> 18:25.892
Hey,

18:25.926 --> 18:27.493
I got news for you,

18:27.528 --> 18:30.063
I got to be alive to keep
your fat ass out of prison.

18:30.096 --> 18:31.264
You think about that?

18:32.733 --> 18:33.600
What now?

18:33.634 --> 18:34.467
Well, I know it's fat.

18:34.500 --> 18:35.435
You don't got to say it.

18:35.468 --> 18:37.003
You don't got to label it.

18:37.037 --> 18:39.139
For God's sakes, I can't--

18:41.441 --> 18:42.375
Oh, no!

18:43.376 --> 18:44.344
My car!

18:47.914 --> 18:49.315
ROCCO: Shame.

18:49.349 --> 18:50.784
Bet you could use
a good lawyer.

18:50.817 --> 18:52.953
Oh, right,
you are a lawyer.

18:52.986 --> 18:53.787
BERLUTI: Did you do this?!

18:53.820 --> 18:55.288
I didn't do nothing.

18:55.321 --> 18:56.757
I was just walking
with my marshmallows,

18:56.790 --> 18:59.526
seen the fire, thought there
was a roast going on.

18:59.560 --> 19:00.701
(laughing)

19:00.734 --> 19:02.836
But, you know,
if I was gonna do something,

19:02.869 --> 19:05.539
it would be because
somebody had something coming.

19:05.572 --> 19:07.941
What goes around,
comes around.

19:07.974 --> 19:10.577
That's, like,
an old Latin saying, isn't it?

19:10.611 --> 19:12.212
I bet you know Latin.

19:12.245 --> 19:14.080
"Res ipsa"

19:14.114 --> 19:15.516
that's lawyer lingo.

19:15.549 --> 19:16.650
Ugh! ohh!

19:18.084 --> 19:20.286
"Vinny, Viddi, Vickie"

19:20.320 --> 19:22.388
that's serious Latin.

19:22.422 --> 19:23.624
Manny!

19:23.657 --> 19:25.158
It was an accident.

19:39.706 --> 19:41.441
WILSON: Ellenor, hey.

19:41.474 --> 19:43.109
Do you know where
I can find Hannah Rose?

19:43.143 --> 19:45.045
Yeah, her office
is just over...

19:45.078 --> 19:46.880
there.

19:46.913 --> 19:48.181
"How are you doing, Tara?

19:48.214 --> 19:51.084
You look just smashing
in your uniform, Tara."

19:51.117 --> 19:52.318
(sighs)

19:53.486 --> 19:57.791
You sent me about 400,000 pages
of documents.

19:57.824 --> 19:59.159
Oh.

19:59.192 --> 20:01.602
I thought it better to give you
too much than too little.

20:01.635 --> 20:03.003
Did you, now?

20:03.036 --> 20:05.138
The trial starts in June.

20:05.171 --> 20:06.540
It would take me 6 months

20:06.573 --> 20:07.674
with a staff of 20

20:07.708 --> 20:09.142
to go through all those boxes.

20:09.175 --> 20:10.644
I believe the request went

20:10.677 --> 20:12.679
to any and all documents
pertaining to design,

20:12.713 --> 20:15.381
as well as documents
discovered in previous lawsuits.

20:15.415 --> 20:16.449
My client has been sued

20:16.482 --> 20:18.284
tens of thousands of times,
Ellenor.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.453
We produce millions
of documents.

20:20.486 --> 20:23.223
I know all
about your client's tactics,

20:23.256 --> 20:26.893
tactics judges in prior trials
have labeled "Reprehensible,"

20:26.927 --> 20:28.461
"Disgusting."

20:28.494 --> 20:30.531
Yes, and I'm trying
to turn over a new leaf

20:30.564 --> 20:32.332
that's why
I'm giving you everything.

20:32.365 --> 20:35.569
You're hiding evidence
in a mountain of papers,

20:35.602 --> 20:36.770
knowing full well

20:36.803 --> 20:38.004
it would be next to impossible

20:38.038 --> 20:39.640
for me to find what I need.

20:39.673 --> 20:42.208
I'm shocked you could make
such an accusation.

20:42.242 --> 20:44.010
This is a blatant abuse

20:44.044 --> 20:45.345
of the discovery process,

20:45.378 --> 20:46.680
and I'm going to the judge.

20:46.713 --> 20:49.182
I certainly hope
you don't do that, Ellenor,

20:49.215 --> 20:50.383
but if you do,

20:50.416 --> 20:53.019
I might be forced to share
a concern of mine.

20:54.788 --> 20:56.189
Which is...

20:56.222 --> 20:58.191
Your firm is understaffed
and ill-equipped

20:58.224 --> 21:00.934
to handle major product
liability litigation.

21:00.967 --> 21:02.669
The fact that
our document production

21:02.703 --> 21:04.104
has so crippled you
is a testament

21:04.137 --> 21:05.806
to your limitations.

21:05.839 --> 21:07.473
I think you should refer
your client

21:07.508 --> 21:08.842
to a larger firm,

21:08.875 --> 21:10.443
and my conscience
might compel me

21:10.476 --> 21:12.378
to share my concern
with the judge.

21:13.714 --> 21:14.748
I suppose,

21:14.781 --> 21:16.750
if we were to settle this now,

21:16.783 --> 21:18.919
we could avoid
all this unpleasantness.

21:20.521 --> 21:23.924
We'll offer you $210,000 today

21:23.957 --> 21:25.559
no admission of liability.

21:26.793 --> 21:29.029
$210,000.

21:30.330 --> 21:32.633
Three people died.

21:32.666 --> 21:36.436
I bet you could use
that money, Ellenor...

21:36.469 --> 21:37.571
money you might not see

21:37.604 --> 21:38.839
if the client
is properly advised

21:38.872 --> 21:40.473
to retain other counsel.

21:41.174 --> 21:42.475
This is disgusting.

21:42.509 --> 21:43.844
That's harsh.

21:45.078 --> 21:47.881
My firm is quite capable
of prosecuting this case.

21:47.914 --> 21:49.750
Excellent.

21:49.783 --> 21:52.619
You will be sure to pass on
my concern to your client,

21:52.653 --> 21:54.020
just the same?

22:00.026 --> 22:02.268
Right on the head?!

22:02.302 --> 22:04.505
He regained consciousness.
He'll be fine.

22:04.538 --> 22:06.540
Jimmy, things are getting
out of control here.

22:06.573 --> 22:08.609
You got to do something

22:08.642 --> 22:09.976
not that it's my place
to tell you that.

22:10.010 --> 22:11.111
(door opens)

22:14.480 --> 22:15.148
Suzy...

22:27.127 --> 22:28.829
First...

22:28.862 --> 22:31.064
whatever our differences,

22:31.097 --> 22:32.999
for somebody
from my neighborhood,

22:33.033 --> 22:35.335
your neighborhood,
to use pepper spray

22:35.368 --> 22:36.837
I would sooner
you whack me, Jimmy,

22:36.870 --> 22:39.573
than to shame
our people that way.

22:39.606 --> 22:41.908
Second, you knocked unconscious

22:41.942 --> 22:43.544
a man very dear to me,

22:43.577 --> 22:44.711
best man at my wedding.

22:44.745 --> 22:46.513
He set my car on fire.

22:46.547 --> 22:48.148
You're talking about property.

22:48.181 --> 22:50.250
Rocco is a human being.

22:50.283 --> 22:52.152
Now I got to bash your head.

22:52.185 --> 22:54.855
BERLUTI: Lenny, you and I
grew up on the same block.

22:54.888 --> 22:56.690
I've seen you
on the baseball field.

22:56.723 --> 22:58.291
You swing a bat like my mother.

22:58.324 --> 23:00.026
Oh, is that what you think?

23:01.502 --> 23:04.237
PAPONI: I think you two
need to have a sit-down...

23:04.270 --> 23:05.606
with Raymond.

23:07.107 --> 23:09.009
Raymond Freschetti?

23:09.042 --> 23:10.677
PAPONI: His neighborhood,

23:11.111 --> 23:12.513
he settles the beefs.

23:13.914 --> 23:15.516
I think that's a good idea.

23:16.316 --> 23:17.718
Wonder what Raymond's
gonna think

23:17.751 --> 23:19.786
of you juicing clients.

23:21.555 --> 23:22.523
Jimmy...

23:22.556 --> 23:24.224
I come in here seeking peace.

23:24.257 --> 23:25.592
Yeah...

23:25.626 --> 23:27.528
I see the olive branch
in your hand.

23:30.864 --> 23:33.333
Let's you and I have a sit-down,

23:33.366 --> 23:35.101
private...

23:35.135 --> 23:36.537
see if we can work it out.

23:38.505 --> 23:39.773
Tomorrow...

23:39.806 --> 23:41.407
here.

23:41.441 --> 23:42.543
2:00.

23:52.653 --> 23:54.855
You handled that very well.

24:00.060 --> 24:01.968
RICHMOND: The background checks
more than once

24:02.002 --> 24:05.539
referred to a strategy of yours
known as plan "B."

24:05.572 --> 24:07.307
What is plan "B," Mr. Young?

24:07.340 --> 24:08.675
It's an offensive strategy

24:08.709 --> 24:09.910
where we try to implicate

24:09.943 --> 24:12.012
another suspect in a crime.

24:12.045 --> 24:14.480
A suspect you have
a good-faith belief

24:14.515 --> 24:15.916
committed the crime?

24:15.949 --> 24:17.250
No.

24:18.552 --> 24:20.453
So, it's a strategy designed

24:20.486 --> 24:22.288
purposely to mislead the jury,

24:22.322 --> 24:24.157
to steer them away
from the truth?

24:24.190 --> 24:26.893
It's an adversarial process,
Mr. Richmond.

24:26.927 --> 24:29.596
The state must prove guilt
beyond all reasonable doubt.

24:29.630 --> 24:32.465
The defense attorney tries
to create reasonable doubt,

24:32.498 --> 24:35.368
doing so zealously
within the bounds of the law.

24:35.401 --> 24:37.971
Plan "B"
is within the bounds.

24:38.004 --> 24:39.673
RICHMOND: Barely.

24:39.706 --> 24:41.241
Anything more than barely

24:41.274 --> 24:42.976
would be less than zealous.

24:43.009 --> 24:45.612
You've tried to convince juries
that somebody else did it.

24:45.646 --> 24:47.413
Somebody you know
to be innocent?

24:48.081 --> 24:50.083
It may strike you
as morally unethical,

24:50.116 --> 24:51.351
and I might agree,

24:51.384 --> 24:52.786
but legal ethics
require that we--

24:52.819 --> 24:54.220
HALBERRY: That's a distinction
without a difference.

24:54.254 --> 24:57.123
YOUNG: No, it's a distinction
with a big difference,

24:57.157 --> 24:58.324
and if you don't get that--

24:58.358 --> 25:00.466
To knowingly accuse
innocent people

25:00.500 --> 25:02.869
even prosecutors don't do that.

25:02.903 --> 25:04.270
You have to understand

25:04.304 --> 25:06.006
how this commission
could have questions

25:06.039 --> 25:07.574
about your character.

25:07.608 --> 25:09.643
DONNELL: Excuse me.
May I be heard?

25:11.578 --> 25:13.079
My name is Bobby Donnell,

25:13.113 --> 25:14.515
and I used to work
with this man.

25:14.548 --> 25:15.516
RICHMOND:
Well, thank you, sir,

25:15.549 --> 25:17.551
but we're not taking
testimony today.

25:17.584 --> 25:19.052
Testimony?

25:19.085 --> 25:20.821
You make it sound
like a trial.

25:21.922 --> 25:23.423
Is somebody on trial here?

25:24.424 --> 25:25.225
Actually, I just thought

25:25.258 --> 25:27.393
we could all use a good laugh.

25:27.427 --> 25:29.495
Talking about
Eugene Young's character--

25:29.530 --> 25:30.731
it's actually a little funny.

25:30.764 --> 25:32.165
You find it funny?

25:32.733 --> 25:35.669
We got a president lying
to us about weapons

25:35.702 --> 25:37.504
so he could start a war.

25:37.938 --> 25:39.873
The president before that
lied under oath

25:39.906 --> 25:42.709
about sex he was having
in the oval office.

25:42.743 --> 25:44.978
We have a supreme court justice
going duck hunting

25:45.011 --> 25:46.079
with the vice president

25:46.112 --> 25:47.748
while presiding over a case

25:47.781 --> 25:50.250
involving the vice president.

25:50.283 --> 25:51.518
Our biggest pop star

25:51.552 --> 25:53.520
is an alleged pedophile.

25:54.621 --> 25:56.222
Some of our athletes
are up on murder

25:56.256 --> 25:57.290
and rape charges,

25:57.323 --> 25:59.259
while the author
of "The Book of Virtues"

25:59.292 --> 26:02.769
gambles millions of dollars
in Vegas.

26:04.437 --> 26:07.073
And you're making character
an issue?

26:07.107 --> 26:08.742
I hate to shock you,
Mr. Donnell,

26:08.775 --> 26:10.410
but it still counts.

26:10.443 --> 26:12.746
Well, if so, you sure as hell
picked the wrong man

26:12.779 --> 26:14.648
to make an example of.

26:14.681 --> 26:16.950
This is a man
who could go to a big firm

26:16.983 --> 26:20.053
and command a salary
upwards of a million dollars.

26:20.086 --> 26:22.322
He works for a fraction
of that. Why?

26:22.355 --> 26:25.291
Because he sees the erosion
of civil rights,

26:25.325 --> 26:27.761
and he fights to stop it.

26:27.794 --> 26:30.531
He sees high courts
forsaking the constitution,

26:30.564 --> 26:32.365
and he rails against it.

26:32.398 --> 26:34.234
He sees an attorney general

26:34.267 --> 26:36.202
rounding up suspects
like poker chips.

26:36.236 --> 26:38.104
HALBERRY: We do not need
a speech about--

26:38.138 --> 26:39.873
DONNELL: You need the speech.

26:41.107 --> 26:42.576
The reason the justice system

26:42.609 --> 26:44.678
is so unfair in this country

26:44.711 --> 26:46.479
Is because the benches
are stacked

26:46.513 --> 26:48.248
with former prosecutors.

26:48.281 --> 26:51.084
We need to see
your character here.

26:51.117 --> 26:52.152
How about you confirm a man

26:52.185 --> 26:53.954
who cares more
about civil liberties

26:53.987 --> 26:55.722
than throwing bodies in prison?

26:58.491 --> 27:01.434
Eugene Young hasn't forgotten
why he went to law school.

27:03.436 --> 27:06.406
Eugene Young
clings to the ideology

27:06.439 --> 27:07.908
that a defendant,

27:07.941 --> 27:10.443
every defendant,

27:10.476 --> 27:12.813
is entitled to a fair trial.

27:13.346 --> 27:14.615
Now, you want to cast him off

27:14.648 --> 27:15.949
because you don't like
his politics

27:15.982 --> 27:18.719
or his views
on the death penalty, fine.

27:20.921 --> 27:23.089
But don't you dare

27:23.123 --> 27:25.225
cite as a pretext...

27:26.927 --> 27:28.394
his character.

27:29.630 --> 27:32.633
(music playing)

27:45.846 --> 27:47.113
Denny Crane.

27:47.147 --> 27:49.149
Sally Heep.
How's it hanging?

27:50.283 --> 27:51.552
How's what hanging?

27:52.185 --> 27:54.287
It's just an expression.

27:54.320 --> 27:55.188
Sally Heep.

27:57.457 --> 27:58.692
Sally...

28:00.200 --> 28:01.535
Make up your mind
about tonight?

28:02.769 --> 28:05.038
Sally, you look like a hooker.

28:05.071 --> 28:06.873
Now, if you were a hooker,
we might have a future,

28:06.907 --> 28:07.874
but...

28:07.908 --> 28:09.676
you're intelligent.

28:09.710 --> 28:11.578
you have self-respect.

28:11.612 --> 28:13.146
You're even sweet.

28:14.347 --> 28:15.882
Those are deal-breakers.

28:15.916 --> 28:17.884
HEEP: Yeah.
Okay, fine.

28:20.286 --> 28:22.255
But while you continue
to mull it over,

28:22.288 --> 28:23.489
just keep in mind

28:23.524 --> 28:26.059
that 25-year-olds
don't just snap back physically.

28:26.092 --> 28:27.794
Emotionally,
we recover fast, too,

28:27.828 --> 28:29.863
which means,
by this time tomorrow,

28:29.896 --> 28:31.297
I'll have moved on.

28:33.867 --> 28:35.201
You got a window, Al.

28:37.037 --> 28:39.706
Just because girls
in your age bracket wait around,

28:39.740 --> 28:41.374
don't be thinking I will.

28:54.120 --> 28:56.089
First, you got to apologize.

28:56.122 --> 28:57.357
I got to apologize?

28:57.390 --> 28:59.760
Yes. Manny Quinn was acting
under the scope

28:59.793 --> 29:01.201
of you and him being friends

29:01.234 --> 29:03.269
when he whacked Rocco
unconscious with the shovel.

29:03.303 --> 29:04.971
You torched my car.

29:05.005 --> 29:05.706
You pepper-sprayed me!

29:05.739 --> 29:07.273
After you mugged Spinny!

29:07.307 --> 29:08.474
Which is what
I'm gonna do to you!

29:08.509 --> 29:09.576
PAPONI: Hey, hey, hey, hey!

29:09.610 --> 29:11.512
We got clients out here.

29:11.545 --> 29:12.613
You guys either work it out

29:12.646 --> 29:14.247
or take it outside.

29:14.280 --> 29:16.249
Or to Raymond.

29:20.220 --> 29:21.487
(exhales slowly)

29:29.730 --> 29:32.899
You can't be juicing
your clients.

29:32.933 --> 29:34.935
That's how you'll get
whacked for real.

29:34.968 --> 29:37.638
Raymond finds out
you're loan-sharking

29:37.671 --> 29:39.339
that's their business, Lenny.

29:39.372 --> 29:40.907
You should know better.

29:41.908 --> 29:43.510
I'm under a lot of pressure.

29:44.545 --> 29:46.580
My wife wants a house
in Florida.

29:46.613 --> 29:48.114
Business has been tight.

29:48.148 --> 29:50.784
To be losing some of it to you

29:50.817 --> 29:52.619
can't you go someplace else?

29:53.687 --> 29:55.956
This has always been my dream...

29:55.989 --> 29:58.091
to come back here.

29:58.124 --> 30:00.701
This isn't an arbitrary thing
for me, Lenny.

30:00.734 --> 30:03.136
This is where I grew up.

30:04.270 --> 30:05.672
(sighs)

30:07.941 --> 30:10.777
Maybe we should form
kind of a partnership.

30:11.845 --> 30:13.213
Me and you?

30:13.246 --> 30:14.681
Yeah, I got connections.

30:14.715 --> 30:15.782
I could help you.
You could help me,

30:15.816 --> 30:18.118
get me some more
of the high-end stuff,

30:18.151 --> 30:19.753
instead of competing
with each other.

30:19.786 --> 30:21.187
Lenny...

30:21.221 --> 30:22.989
I'm an honest lawyer.

30:23.023 --> 30:24.024
Totally?

30:25.191 --> 30:28.261
Can't you just be honest
most of the time?

30:28.294 --> 30:29.796
Me and you...

30:29.830 --> 30:31.532
as partners...

30:31.565 --> 30:32.699
come on.

30:37.804 --> 30:40.774
I represent Charlie Andretti,

30:42.042 --> 30:44.144
Manny's supplier.

30:44.177 --> 30:45.579
I can sort of slip the Feds

30:45.612 --> 30:47.213
some information they could use

30:47.247 --> 30:49.249
to put him away
in exchange

30:49.282 --> 30:51.585
for dropping the case
against Manny.

30:52.953 --> 30:55.155
You'd turn in your own client?

30:55.188 --> 30:57.157
I only do it when I can be sure

30:57.190 --> 30:58.825
it don't get found out.

31:00.233 --> 31:01.501
Look...

31:01.535 --> 31:04.070
I'm certainly not gonna go
into a business

31:04.104 --> 31:05.772
with a corrupt attorney.

31:06.940 --> 31:08.274
Suppose I change.

31:08.975 --> 31:10.877
My wife wants me
to improve myself.

31:10.911 --> 31:12.713
I was hoping
maybe you could be, uh,

31:12.746 --> 31:14.280
a good influence.

31:16.817 --> 31:18.819
I can get Manny off.

31:18.852 --> 31:20.320
Come on, Jimmy.

31:20.353 --> 31:21.622
I got street creds.

31:21.655 --> 31:23.724
You got integrity.

31:23.757 --> 31:26.560
How about, you know,

31:26.593 --> 31:28.194
a trial basis?

31:32.566 --> 31:34.400
DONNELL: You want to go
to court, Milton, fine,

31:34.434 --> 31:35.468
but don't be waving
that flag

31:35.501 --> 31:36.837
like it's some big threat.

31:36.870 --> 31:38.905
I'm in court every day.

31:38.939 --> 31:39.773
You're not.

31:39.806 --> 31:41.374
I like court.
You don't.

31:41.407 --> 31:43.677
I'm comfortable in court.
You are not.

31:43.710 --> 31:45.779
So I want you
to hang up the phone,

31:45.812 --> 31:47.247
call me again,

31:47.280 --> 31:48.815
and be honest.

31:48.849 --> 31:50.784
Tell me you want to settle,

31:50.817 --> 31:52.819
because you don't want
to go to court.

31:53.554 --> 31:55.989
Goodbye, Milt.
Hope to hear from you.

31:57.524 --> 31:59.325
You look like
you're having fun.

32:00.333 --> 32:01.401
Hey.

32:01.434 --> 32:02.368
Hey, how did you
even know about--

32:02.402 --> 32:03.570
DONNELL:
Ellenor called me.

32:03.604 --> 32:06.707
I figured I'd save your ass
like old times.

32:06.740 --> 32:08.441
Now, I remember
a lot of ass-saving,

32:08.474 --> 32:10.511
but I think you might have
things mixed up a bit.

32:11.512 --> 32:13.146
Any word?

32:13.179 --> 32:14.414
Not yet, you know.

32:14.447 --> 32:15.582
I don't have my hopes up.

32:16.249 --> 32:17.651
That isn't true, Eugene.

32:17.684 --> 32:19.986
Your hopes have been up
on this for many years.

32:21.421 --> 32:22.689
Yeah.

32:22.723 --> 32:25.692
Look, I've been meaning
to call you about, uh,

32:25.726 --> 32:26.860
when you gave me the firm,

32:26.893 --> 32:28.294
I know you expected--

32:30.664 --> 32:32.733
being a judge is something
I've always wanted.

32:33.433 --> 32:34.935
Eugene, I know that.

32:34.968 --> 32:36.469
I feel like...

32:38.038 --> 32:39.673
if I ever get this...

32:42.308 --> 32:43.910
I'd be walking out
on something

32:43.944 --> 32:45.378
you left in my charge.

32:45.411 --> 32:46.312
DONNELL: Now it's you

32:46.346 --> 32:48.214
mixing things up.

32:48.248 --> 32:49.750
I walked...

32:49.783 --> 32:51.017
remember?

32:52.118 --> 32:53.419
I just wish
I'd done a better job

32:53.453 --> 32:55.188
running the firm.
DONNELL: Don't even go there.

32:55.221 --> 32:57.290
You led that firm
the same way

32:57.323 --> 32:59.225
you've always served it,

32:59.259 --> 32:59.993
with honor.

33:01.702 --> 33:03.904
(cellphone rings)

33:03.937 --> 33:05.071
One second.

33:07.741 --> 33:08.875
Eugene Young.

33:11.578 --> 33:12.478
Yeah.

33:14.214 --> 33:15.215
Yeah.

33:16.583 --> 33:18.318
Okay. Thank you.

33:21.722 --> 33:23.056
I got it.

33:24.424 --> 33:25.258
Got what?

33:25.291 --> 33:26.326
The judge thing--they--

33:26.359 --> 33:28.529
the council confirmed me.

33:28.562 --> 33:29.596
I got it.

33:30.163 --> 33:31.031
Eugene, that's--

33:31.064 --> 33:32.265
Look, look, look, look, it's--

33:32.298 --> 33:33.066
it's no big deal.

33:33.099 --> 33:34.167
It's...

33:35.401 --> 33:36.570
I got it!

33:36.603 --> 33:38.404
(laughing)

33:41.307 --> 33:44.310
(music playing)

33:54.287 --> 33:55.656
Denny Crane.

33:55.689 --> 33:56.690
Good for you.

33:57.758 --> 34:00.133
That woman scares me.

34:00.166 --> 34:01.501
It's titillating.

34:05.171 --> 34:06.472
For the record,

34:06.507 --> 34:08.274
your offer is rejected.

34:09.409 --> 34:11.077
I'm disappointed.

34:11.110 --> 34:12.913
I'll bet.

34:12.946 --> 34:14.014
Rather than steer my client

34:14.047 --> 34:16.583
toward accepting
an unsatisfying offer,

34:16.617 --> 34:19.152
I steered her toward
the firm Fine and Ambrogne,

34:19.185 --> 34:20.219
which specializes

34:20.253 --> 34:23.489
in design defect
product liability.

34:23.524 --> 34:26.860
I've also filed
with the judge and the bar

34:26.893 --> 34:28.094
a complaint concerning

34:28.128 --> 34:31.397
your client's dishonest
stonewalling tactics.

34:31.431 --> 34:33.498
And on a personal level,

34:33.534 --> 34:35.335
it's one thing for a corporation

34:35.368 --> 34:37.971
to engage
in systemic discovery abuse,

34:38.004 --> 34:40.139
but for an attorney...

34:40.172 --> 34:41.842
these are real people.

34:41.875 --> 34:43.543
This is real suffering,

34:43.577 --> 34:45.478
injured by your client's
vehicles,

34:45.512 --> 34:46.478
and for you...

34:51.818 --> 34:52.985
never mind.

34:54.454 --> 34:56.857
I've already filed
my notice of withdrawal.

34:56.889 --> 34:58.258
And as I said...

34:58.291 --> 35:00.534
the offer it's rejected.

35:02.368 --> 35:03.403
Ellenor...

35:07.741 --> 35:09.610
I know you've
defended criminals,

35:09.643 --> 35:12.312
people you have no sympathy for.

35:12.345 --> 35:13.780
in civil cases,

35:13.814 --> 35:16.382
defendants are entitled
to representation, as well.

35:16.416 --> 35:17.851
It's not the same,

35:17.884 --> 35:18.985
and you know it.

35:20.220 --> 35:21.855
Yeah, I suppose I do...

35:23.356 --> 35:24.991
which is why
I'm feeling particularly bad

35:25.025 --> 35:26.627
about myself.

35:26.660 --> 35:29.329
I think I need to go shopping,

35:29.362 --> 35:30.597
and not just
for something little--

35:30.631 --> 35:32.398
I am so ashamed,

35:32.432 --> 35:34.234
I'm gonna buy a car,

35:34.267 --> 35:36.102
something really, really...

35:36.136 --> 35:38.304
redemptive.

35:38.338 --> 35:39.873
Would you like to come with me?

35:39.906 --> 35:41.808
Because I'd like that

35:41.842 --> 35:43.610
watching you...

35:43.644 --> 35:47.013
watch me buy a $100,000 car.

35:51.351 --> 35:53.053
Can you excuse me a second?

35:56.523 --> 35:57.691
(sighs)

36:04.304 --> 36:05.471
Hmm.

36:12.045 --> 36:13.747
Oh, gee.

36:13.780 --> 36:14.948
Now I need to shop.

36:31.331 --> 36:33.366
Oh. What happened
to your date?

36:33.399 --> 36:35.235
There isn't going
to be a date,

36:35.268 --> 36:37.470
and I'd appreciate you
not counseling me

36:37.504 --> 36:39.706
towards statutory crimes.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.709
Alan, do you want to end up
an old--

36:42.743 --> 36:44.444
Why are you
so invested in this?

36:44.477 --> 36:45.712
Tell me that.

36:45.746 --> 36:47.648
Well, I suppose
that when I see you alone,

36:47.681 --> 36:50.016
I worry about the company
you're keeping.

36:51.952 --> 36:53.386
Let me tell you something

36:53.419 --> 36:55.288
the most lonely I've ever been

36:55.321 --> 36:56.757
has been in a relationship.

36:56.790 --> 36:58.191
I'm happiest alone.

36:58.224 --> 36:59.760
The conversation's better--

36:59.793 --> 37:02.068
certainly, the sex
is, albeit, heavy-handed.

37:02.101 --> 37:03.803
Oh, that's a funny bit...

37:04.904 --> 37:06.439
an entertaining one, too.

37:06.472 --> 37:07.774
But as bits go,

37:09.075 --> 37:10.877
it's a bit.

37:11.911 --> 37:13.046
Tara...

37:14.914 --> 37:17.416
I have indulged
your pop psychoanalysis

37:17.450 --> 37:20.921
with good humor
for some time now,

37:20.954 --> 37:22.856
but to set
the record straight,

37:23.957 --> 37:25.358
you do not know me--

37:25.391 --> 37:26.593
not even...

37:26.627 --> 37:28.394
as bits go...

37:28.428 --> 37:29.763
a bit.

37:31.331 --> 37:32.933
I know that you're afraid
to let yourself

37:32.966 --> 37:34.134
feel for people.

37:34.167 --> 37:35.101
SHORE: I'm quite capable
of letting myself feel...

37:35.135 --> 37:36.402
WILSON:
I know that you're afraid

37:36.436 --> 37:37.403
to look at yourself
through other people's eyes--

37:37.437 --> 37:38.271
SHORE:
Especially disenchantment

37:38.304 --> 37:39.973
that one comes up easily.

37:40.006 --> 37:42.976
And there you go,
turning it into a word game.

37:43.009 --> 37:44.277
It's you playing games,

37:44.310 --> 37:46.547
telling me I can't feel
that's quite an indictment--

37:46.580 --> 37:47.681
WILSON: Then prove me wrong
with evidence

37:47.714 --> 37:50.283
the last time you felt
for a woman in any relationship.

37:50.316 --> 37:51.518
I feel for you!

37:56.189 --> 37:58.424
That doesn't mean I'd...

38:00.867 --> 38:01.968
ever...

38:10.544 --> 38:12.278
I have feelings for you.

38:16.282 --> 38:18.318
(music playing)

38:18.351 --> 38:20.186
(exhales sharply)

38:25.458 --> 38:27.027
Now, I'd appreciate it.

38:36.436 --> 38:39.540
Contrary to the rumors,
I do practice law here,

38:39.573 --> 38:41.407
and I have a lot
of work to do.

38:43.944 --> 38:46.112
Would you excuse me, Tara?

38:53.453 --> 38:54.721
Alan...

38:54.755 --> 38:57.190
Would you excuse me, Tara?

38:57.223 --> 39:00.233
(music playing)

40:15.549 --> 40:16.817
(sighs)

40:34.234 --> 40:35.435
(gavel bangs)

40:37.871 --> 40:40.874
(music playing)

41:13.346 --> 41:16.349
(music playing)

41:37.804 --> 41:39.005
WOMAN: Stinker!

41:40.941 --> 41:43.844
(music playing)
