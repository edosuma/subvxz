00:00.431 --> 00:02.833
â™ªâ™ª

00:08.479 --> 00:11.842
I'm here, I'm here.

00:11.842 --> 00:13.784
Bob, you're late again.

00:13.784 --> 00:15.716
It's not my fault
I overslept.

00:15.716 --> 00:17.218
It's Bree's.

00:17.218 --> 00:19.290
What?! How is it
my fault?

00:19.290 --> 00:21.692
You keep showin' up
in my dreams.

00:27.828 --> 00:30.461
What's up with youse?
Someone ask you to prom?

00:30.461 --> 00:32.833
No.

00:32.833 --> 00:35.366
But thanks for opening up
old wounds.

00:36.637 --> 00:39.840
After countless hours
of research and development,

00:39.840 --> 00:42.012
Douglas and I have
finally perfected

00:42.012 --> 00:46.377
the most amazing
bionic operating
system upgrade ever.

00:46.377 --> 00:49.220
I woke up for this?

00:49.220 --> 00:51.782
This upgrade is gonna be
like going from

00:51.782 --> 00:54.285
motor scooters
to jet engines.

00:54.285 --> 00:56.987
It'll make all of your abilities
ten times more powerful.

00:56.987 --> 00:59.130
An upgrade, huh?

00:59.130 --> 01:02.363
Well, I'm not sure you can
make my leg any more powerful,

01:02.363 --> 01:04.394
but go ahead;
give it a go.

01:04.394 --> 01:05.966
Ha!

01:07.037 --> 01:09.370
Sorry, Leo,
the upgrade only works

01:09.370 --> 01:11.742
on people with
bionic chips.

01:11.742 --> 01:14.675
Be grateful you have
a bionic arm and a bionic leg.

01:14.675 --> 01:16.377
That's all you're getting.

01:16.377 --> 01:18.849
At least until
your next horrific accident.

01:18.849 --> 01:20.411
( fake laughter )

01:24.355 --> 01:27.188
Mr. Davenport, are you sure
that this new upgrade is safe?

01:27.188 --> 01:29.760
I mean, some of
our students haven't
even mastered their bionics

01:29.760 --> 01:31.222
at the current level.

01:31.222 --> 01:33.524
Yeah, Mr. Davenport,
I know you wanna give us

01:33.524 --> 01:35.526
like, the coolest
thing ever,

01:35.526 --> 01:37.528
( whining )
but do you have to?

01:37.528 --> 01:38.869
Don't worry.

01:38.869 --> 01:41.071
I built in a skill app
that allows the students

01:41.071 --> 01:43.934
to master their amped-up
abilities instantly.

01:43.934 --> 01:47.278
Bottom line, this upgrade
is the best thing

01:47.278 --> 01:49.940
that Donnie and I have
ever created together.

01:49.940 --> 01:52.183
- I am so proud of you.
- No, I'm proud of you.

01:52.183 --> 01:53.744
BOTH: I'm proud of you.

01:53.744 --> 01:56.347
Hey, hey.

01:56.347 --> 01:58.349
You know what'll
make us all proud?

01:58.349 --> 02:01.822
If you two go back
to hating each other.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.194
Stop, Bree.

02:03.194 --> 02:05.956
You're embarrassing
yourself.

02:05.956 --> 02:09.029
Oh, sweet girl,
you don't have to beg.

02:09.029 --> 02:10.431
I'll allow you
to kiss me.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.165
Okay, I'll wake him up.

02:14.165 --> 02:16.006
Nope. I got this.

02:20.811 --> 02:24.144
Hm. They actually make
a cute couple.

02:26.977 --> 02:29.750
The world's first
 bionic superhumans.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.252
They're stronger than us.

02:31.252 --> 02:33.954
Faster.
 Smarter.

02:33.954 --> 02:36.757
The next generation
 of the human race is...

02:36.757 --> 02:38.789
living on a bionic island.

03:15.666 --> 03:17.668
How's it going
with the upgrade?

03:17.668 --> 03:19.700
I'll let you
be the judge.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.873
Go ahead, Jenny.
Show him how powerful
you are now.

03:27.177 --> 03:28.909
Wow!

03:28.909 --> 03:30.411
That is powerful.

03:30.411 --> 03:33.043
You just made
an old man jump.

03:33.043 --> 03:35.486
Well, that's the last
of the students.

03:35.486 --> 03:37.518
Oh, great. I'll do
Adam, Bree and Chase.

03:37.518 --> 03:40.090
Yeah, you do that,

03:40.090 --> 03:41.892
and the guy who
really needs the upgrade

03:41.892 --> 03:43.494
will just stand
right over here

03:43.494 --> 03:45.496
wishing he was
actually part of the family.

03:45.496 --> 03:47.157
Don't worry, Leo.

03:47.157 --> 03:50.100
I'm working on something
very special just for you.

03:50.100 --> 03:52.703
Really?

03:52.703 --> 03:54.505
How would you like to be
the proud owner

03:54.505 --> 03:58.168
of the world's first
bionic nostril?

04:00.571 --> 04:02.473
Bionic nostril?

04:02.473 --> 04:04.775
You can't be serious.

04:04.775 --> 04:06.977
I'm considering it;
we'll talk.

04:08.779 --> 04:11.452
Okay, Adam,
we'll do you first.

04:15.055 --> 04:17.156
That's weird.
The upgrade's not taking.

04:17.156 --> 04:19.829
It's probably
searching for his brain.

04:19.829 --> 04:22.062
Bree, let's try you.

04:26.937 --> 04:28.739
Chase.

04:30.901 --> 04:32.403
I don't get it.

04:32.403 --> 04:34.745
Why isn't the upgrade
working on any of them?

04:34.745 --> 04:38.479
Probably because
their bionics are
first generation.

04:38.479 --> 04:41.211
We built the upgrade
for the students'
infrastructure.

04:41.211 --> 04:44.214
It must not be compatible
with their older systems.

04:44.214 --> 04:46.587
There has to be some
way you can adapt it.

04:46.587 --> 04:49.059
I can probably
work something out,

04:49.059 --> 04:51.422
but given how old
your bionic architecture is,

04:51.422 --> 04:54.224
I'll never be able
to match the power
the students have.

04:55.426 --> 04:57.568
Who's old now?

04:58.899 --> 05:01.472
So let me
get this straight.

05:01.472 --> 05:03.634
They all just became
more powerful,

05:03.634 --> 05:05.506
and we're stuck
like this forever?

05:05.506 --> 05:08.879
Oh, my, that certainly
is a shame.

05:10.881 --> 05:13.814
If all the students
are more advanced
than we are,

05:13.814 --> 05:16.717
then that means that
Adam, Bree and I are...

05:16.717 --> 05:19.650
obsolete.

05:26.657 --> 05:28.959
Here we go.

05:30.461 --> 05:33.233
Douglas Davenport.

05:33.233 --> 05:35.836
Officer Nichols.
( chuckles )

05:35.836 --> 05:38.639
I haven't seen you
since I scaled that wall.

05:39.870 --> 05:41.642
This your son?

05:41.642 --> 05:43.944
Maybe. Can you tell me
what he did first,

05:43.944 --> 05:45.616
and then I'll let you know?

05:45.616 --> 05:48.118
He's been running
all over town

05:48.118 --> 05:50.621
shooting fire
from his eyes.

05:50.621 --> 05:53.554
Yeah, I've never seen him
before in my life.

05:56.026 --> 05:58.328
He should be going to
juvenile detention,

05:58.328 --> 06:00.561
but that's the last place
I want a punk with bionics,

06:00.561 --> 06:02.893
so I'm giving him
another chance,

06:02.893 --> 06:06.296
as long as you promise
to keep him under control.

06:06.296 --> 06:08.368
Thank you, officer.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.442
I can promise you
this won't happen again.

06:11.442 --> 06:14.945
Good. 'Cause I
don't want to come
back here again.

06:14.945 --> 06:17.277
You machine people
freak me out.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.082
What were you thinking
letting him leave this academy

06:22.082 --> 06:23.854
with his bionics
activated?

06:23.854 --> 06:25.185
He promised me
he wouldn't use 'em

06:25.185 --> 06:27.688
unless it was
completely necessary.

06:27.688 --> 06:29.690
Come on, you can't
give me bionics

06:29.690 --> 06:31.061
and expect me
not to use 'em.

06:31.061 --> 06:33.293
He has a point.
When I first got my...

06:33.293 --> 06:34.425
Quiet, Leo.

06:34.425 --> 06:35.866
All righty then.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.600
Do your adopted parents
know that you've been

06:39.600 --> 06:41.401
causing trouble
with your bionics?

06:41.401 --> 06:44.935
No. They don't get
this whole bionic thing.

06:44.935 --> 06:47.207
That's why I asked
the officer to bring me here.

06:49.279 --> 06:51.081
What are you gonna
do here, Douglas?

06:51.081 --> 06:53.243
This is your first chance
to really step up

06:53.243 --> 06:54.915
in this kid's life
and be a dad.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.687
You're right.

06:56.687 --> 06:58.418
Daniel...

07:00.350 --> 07:02.192
Meet your new dad.

07:02.192 --> 07:04.024
Douglas.

07:05.125 --> 07:07.427
Fine.

07:07.427 --> 07:12.132
Look, since I can't
trust you to be responsible

07:12.132 --> 07:13.764
with your bionics,

07:13.764 --> 07:14.805
I guess we'll just
have to teach you

07:14.805 --> 07:16.767
how to be responsible.

07:16.767 --> 07:18.939
As long as
your parents approve,

07:18.939 --> 07:22.142
I'm enrolling you in
the Davenport Bionic Academy.

07:22.142 --> 07:24.144
Really? Awesome.

07:24.144 --> 07:27.578
And, since Leo
has been doing

07:27.578 --> 07:31.151
such a great job as
the academy's newest mentor,

07:31.151 --> 07:32.753
I think it's only fitting

07:32.753 --> 07:34.585
that he train
our newest student.

07:34.585 --> 07:35.956
Thanks, Douglas.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.257
No problem, buddy.

07:37.257 --> 07:39.429
See, this way,
if it doesn't work out,

07:39.429 --> 07:41.361
we can all blame you.

07:45.496 --> 07:47.367
We've dedicated
our entire lives

07:47.367 --> 07:48.599
to being bionic heroes.

07:48.599 --> 07:51.141
Now, we don't even matter.

07:51.141 --> 07:53.173
Yeah. When you
think about it,

07:53.173 --> 07:55.275
it's like we've been
training our own replacements.

07:55.275 --> 07:57.578
Guys, what's with
the doom and gloom?

07:57.578 --> 07:59.750
I'm actually okay with it.

07:59.750 --> 08:01.812
In fact, I've been checking out
some retirement communities,

08:01.812 --> 08:03.253
and they're awesome.
Look.

08:03.253 --> 08:05.315
This one has railings
on the toilets.

08:06.857 --> 08:09.489
Retirement?
No way. I'm a teenager.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.422
I haven't even got
my driver's license yet.

08:12.422 --> 08:14.424
Oh, don't worry,
you won't need it.

08:14.424 --> 08:17.828
Most of these old folks'
homes don't even let you drive.

08:17.828 --> 08:19.830
But get this.

08:19.830 --> 08:21.401
There's a van that'll
take you to the market

08:21.401 --> 08:23.674
twice a week.

08:23.674 --> 08:26.036
We're not retiring.

08:26.036 --> 08:28.508
I'm gonna figure out a way
to give us an upgrade.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.240
And not only that.

08:30.240 --> 08:31.642
I'm gonna make sure
it's even better

08:31.642 --> 08:33.313
than everyone else's.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.414
After all, I am
the smartest man in the world.

08:35.414 --> 08:37.147
Not anymore,
you has-been.

08:38.217 --> 08:40.490
Whoa!

08:40.490 --> 08:43.323
This place comes
with people

08:43.323 --> 08:46.857
who will change
your pants.

08:46.857 --> 08:48.829
Now that's easy living.

08:53.433 --> 08:56.667
Okay, Daniel, since you
have bionic ability replication,

08:56.667 --> 08:59.209
we'll start you off by touching
one of these students,

08:59.209 --> 09:01.271
so that you can
take on their ability.

09:01.271 --> 09:02.412
Okay.

09:02.412 --> 09:04.144
Wait a minute.

09:04.144 --> 09:05.946
This kid can just touch me,
and he'll be able to do

09:05.946 --> 09:07.948
- everything I can do?
- That's right.

09:07.948 --> 09:09.780
Well, here's
my class schedule,

09:09.780 --> 09:11.381
my chores, have at it.

09:11.381 --> 09:13.553
I'm gonna go sleep
until I'm 20.

09:15.085 --> 09:18.328
- Bob!
- It was worth a shot.

09:20.661 --> 09:23.393
Okay, Daniel,
go ahead.

09:26.496 --> 09:29.469
Great. Now you have
his bionic thunderclap.

09:29.469 --> 09:30.641
Cool.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.148
Not so hard.

09:38.148 --> 09:39.950
Sorry.

09:44.314 --> 09:47.658
Well, I can see
this is going well.

09:49.720 --> 09:51.892
Daniel, you have
to focus.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.593
I am focusing.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.495
But how am I supposed
to master my abilities

09:55.495 --> 09:57.267
when I get a new one
every five minutes?

09:57.267 --> 09:59.129
He does have a point.

09:59.129 --> 10:02.072
Yeah. Too bad you can't
upgrade him like everyone else.

10:02.072 --> 10:04.304
Then a skill app would
bring him up to speed instantly.

10:04.304 --> 10:06.076
I can give him
the upgrade,

10:06.076 --> 10:08.308
but I'm not gonna.

10:08.308 --> 10:11.411
Not till he shows me
he can be responsible
with his bionics.

10:11.411 --> 10:13.213
- But, Dad...
- End of discussion.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.115
Now get back
to your training.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.618
I gotta be honest,
Douglas.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.420
This whole "you being
a dad" thing

10:20.420 --> 10:21.551
is a little weird.

10:21.551 --> 10:24.224
I know.
It's freakin' me out.

10:26.056 --> 10:29.259
Okay, Daniel.
Touch Bob's arm.

10:29.259 --> 10:31.061
But be careful.

10:31.061 --> 10:32.602
I'm a fragile flower.

10:35.565 --> 10:39.239
Great. Now let's see
how you do with super strength.

10:39.239 --> 10:40.410
Okay.

10:43.443 --> 10:45.575
- Bob!
- I know.

10:45.575 --> 10:47.647
I can throw him much farther.
Let me try again.

10:51.281 --> 10:54.384
Got it. If I reconfigure
the operator precedence,

10:54.384 --> 10:56.286
that should fix
the upgrade.

10:57.557 --> 11:00.160
( computer beeping )

11:00.160 --> 11:01.461
You stupid hunk of junk!

11:01.461 --> 11:03.493
You're useless!

11:03.493 --> 11:06.296
Useless! Useless!

11:09.499 --> 11:11.001
Do you mind?

11:11.001 --> 11:13.804
This is a private moment
between a man and his computer.

11:15.545 --> 11:17.277
Chase, have you seen
my students?

11:17.277 --> 11:19.780
- Nope.
- Huh.

11:19.780 --> 11:22.452
We were supposed to
start training an hour ago.

11:22.452 --> 11:24.454
Today's lesson
is very important.

11:24.454 --> 11:26.717
It's called "You're not
better than me."

11:31.962 --> 11:33.964
Hey, has anybody
seen Bob?

11:35.165 --> 11:36.827
Leo said he was training
a little while ago,

11:36.827 --> 11:38.468
but hasn't seen him since.

11:38.468 --> 11:40.300
Now that I'm retiring,
I need to know

11:40.300 --> 11:42.172
if he can play golf
with me on Thursdays.

11:43.974 --> 11:45.976
Wait, no. First,
my students are missing,

11:45.976 --> 11:47.677
and now Bob?

11:47.677 --> 11:49.479
Something weird
is going on.

11:49.479 --> 11:50.640
I'm gonna go look
for everyone.

11:52.642 --> 11:55.946
Speaking of weird,
why are you wearing that?

11:55.946 --> 11:58.388
The hat?
'Cause I'm a golfer.

11:58.388 --> 12:00.490
The kilt.

12:00.490 --> 12:03.854
Oh. Because somebody
changing my pants

12:03.854 --> 12:05.355
is easy living.

12:05.355 --> 12:08.458
This is what I call
breezy living.

12:08.458 --> 12:11.061
Ugh!

12:13.263 --> 12:15.265
Come on, Daniel.

12:15.265 --> 12:16.736
Make your force
field bigger.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.869
- I'm trying.
- Concentrate.

12:18.869 --> 12:20.710
It's kinda hard
to concentrate

12:20.710 --> 12:23.573
when you keep yelling
"Concentrate." Ah!

12:23.573 --> 12:26.446
You know, this would be
a whole lot easier

12:26.446 --> 12:28.018
if you just
gave me that upgrade.

12:28.018 --> 12:30.420
No. You heard your dad.

12:30.420 --> 12:33.183
He wants you to master your
bionics the old-fashioned way.

12:33.183 --> 12:35.025
Okay.

12:35.025 --> 12:37.027
But if my training's
not going well,

12:37.027 --> 12:39.459
doesn't that say more about
you as a mentor

12:39.459 --> 12:40.891
than me as a student?

12:40.891 --> 12:42.762
Oh, please, Danny boy.

12:44.734 --> 12:47.137
I invented that trick.

12:47.137 --> 12:49.399
You play on a person's
insecurities and get
what you want.

12:49.399 --> 12:51.601
It's not going
to work on me.

12:51.601 --> 12:53.443
You're right.

12:53.443 --> 12:56.346
I guess I'm just not ready
to be a bionic student.

12:58.348 --> 13:02.582
Kinda like you're not ready
to be a bionic mentor.

13:06.256 --> 13:08.919
All right, Daniel,
let's see how this
upgrade works.

13:14.594 --> 13:16.526
Well, that proves it.

13:16.526 --> 13:18.698
I am a great mentor.

13:18.698 --> 13:21.501
Hey, if you thought
that was cool,
watch this.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.675
How did you do that?

13:25.675 --> 13:27.337
I didn't.

13:27.337 --> 13:29.339
Then how did they all
just disappear?

13:29.339 --> 13:31.311
I don't know.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.413
But if anyone asks,
I'm blaming it on you.

13:36.917 --> 13:39.249
Mr. Davenport,
we have a problem.

13:39.249 --> 13:40.921
I can't find
my students anywhere.

13:40.921 --> 13:43.493
Are you sure they're not just
avoiding your training session?

13:43.493 --> 13:45.595
I mean, I've sat
through your class.

13:45.595 --> 13:47.257
We all think you could
use a little pizzazz.

13:48.929 --> 13:51.801
Big D., all the students
in the training area

13:51.801 --> 13:52.963
- just vanished.
- What?

13:52.963 --> 13:54.634
Bob's gone, too.

13:54.634 --> 13:56.836
And I can't
lose my Bob.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.808
We have an 8:00 a.m.
tee time.

14:00.270 --> 14:01.972
All right,
everybody calm down.

14:01.972 --> 14:03.573
There has to be
a logical explanation.

14:05.745 --> 14:07.417
Or not.

14:10.320 --> 14:12.382
Daniel!

14:12.382 --> 14:13.753
Everybody's gone.

14:13.753 --> 14:15.555
What are we
gonna do?

14:15.555 --> 14:17.087
What do you mean, we?

14:17.087 --> 14:18.989
I'm retired.

14:26.536 --> 14:28.698
I double-checked
the whole academy.

14:28.698 --> 14:30.000
All the students
are gone.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.501
The new upgrade must've
caused a glitch

14:31.501 --> 14:33.173
that made them
geo-leap away.

14:33.173 --> 14:35.575
Daniel disappeared,
and we didn't give
him the upgrade.

14:35.575 --> 14:38.348
Technically,
that is correct.

14:38.348 --> 14:40.080
You did not
give him the upgrade.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.551
Leo!

14:41.551 --> 14:44.084
That kid was impossible
to train.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.655
And trust me,
I happen to know

14:45.655 --> 14:47.757
a thing or two about
slow learners.

14:47.757 --> 14:50.991
I specifically told you
not to give him that upgrade.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.662
Don't blame me.

14:52.662 --> 14:54.664
You built the software
that made everyone disappear.

14:54.664 --> 14:56.326
For the record,

14:56.326 --> 14:58.498
Donnie had just as much
to do with this as I did.

14:58.498 --> 14:59.769
If not more.
A lot more.

14:59.769 --> 15:01.831
In fact, this whole thing
was his idea.

15:01.831 --> 15:03.803
- It was not!
- Was too.

15:03.803 --> 15:06.076
- No, it wasn't.
- ( both talking at once )

15:06.076 --> 15:08.608
Stop arguing.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.610
We have to find them.

15:10.610 --> 15:14.444
Although with them gone,
we are top dog again.

15:14.444 --> 15:16.716
Do something!

15:16.716 --> 15:18.818
Okay. I'll pull up
their GPS locators,

15:18.818 --> 15:20.490
and find out
where they are.

15:22.622 --> 15:24.995
Nothing's coming up.
Their signals must have
been deactivated.

15:24.995 --> 15:28.058
Great. So now our brother
and the entire student body
are missing,

15:28.058 --> 15:30.660
and we have no idea
where they are.

15:30.660 --> 15:32.562
They could be anywhere
in the world.

15:36.766 --> 15:38.408
Where are we?

15:38.408 --> 15:40.740
In a dark room
with metal walls.

15:40.740 --> 15:43.243
I can see that, Bob.

15:43.243 --> 15:45.545
Then why'd you ask?

15:46.616 --> 15:49.379
Wait. Maybe this is
another dream.

15:49.379 --> 15:52.382
If I squint,
with your moppy hair,

15:52.382 --> 15:54.624
you could easily
pass for Bree.

15:57.227 --> 16:00.330
It's okay, everyone.
I'm gonna get you outta here.

16:01.661 --> 16:04.634
Daniel, they don't
even know you.

16:04.634 --> 16:07.537
Let me give the pep talk.

16:07.537 --> 16:11.041
Ignore what he said, guys.
We're hosed.

16:12.302 --> 16:13.973
We gotta do something.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.806
Bob, use your super strength
to try to break us out.

16:16.806 --> 16:18.678
Okay.

16:32.662 --> 16:34.964
Well, I'm a man
of my word.

16:34.964 --> 16:36.996
We're hosed.

16:38.668 --> 16:40.470
Ooh, I know.

16:40.470 --> 16:42.202
What if I replicate
your strength, and we
try together?

16:42.202 --> 16:45.635
Aw, that's cute when
you get all feisty.

16:48.478 --> 16:51.611
I'm afraid your bionics
 are useless here.

16:51.611 --> 16:54.544
These walls block
 your pathetic little chips.

16:54.544 --> 16:55.885
Who are you?

16:55.885 --> 16:57.887
I'm the woman
 who's going to take out

16:57.887 --> 17:00.120
all bionic superhumans
 and replace them

17:00.120 --> 17:02.292
with my android technology.

17:02.292 --> 17:03.893
But you can call me
 Giselle.

17:03.893 --> 17:05.555
Oh, thanks.

17:05.555 --> 17:07.696
I never would've
remembered that first part.

17:08.858 --> 17:10.859
How'd we get here?

17:10.859 --> 17:14.204
I was finally able to hack in
 to your chips remotely

17:14.204 --> 17:16.406
and geo-leap you here.

17:16.406 --> 17:20.210
Wait. Where are
 Adam, Bree and Chase?

17:20.210 --> 17:22.112
Probably still at
the academy.

17:22.112 --> 17:24.174
See, there was this whole thing
about how our bionics

17:24.174 --> 17:25.845
are newer than theirs,

17:25.845 --> 17:27.577
and they couldn't
get the upgrade,

17:27.577 --> 17:28.918
and boy, were they upset.
Chase was like--

17:28.918 --> 17:30.780
Stop talking.

17:32.382 --> 17:34.284
What are you gonna
do with us?

17:34.284 --> 17:36.786
I'm gonna destroy you.

17:36.786 --> 17:39.959
But first,
 I'm gonna use you as bait.

17:42.892 --> 17:45.095
Bob, we have to get
everyone out of here.

17:45.095 --> 17:46.696
How?

17:46.696 --> 17:48.738
Don't worry.
I have an idea.

17:51.771 --> 17:54.204
I have tried
every way possible

17:54.204 --> 17:56.946
to remotely reactivate
their GPS locators,

17:56.946 --> 17:58.378
and nothing
is working.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.780
Then we'll have to find them
the old-fashioned way.

18:00.780 --> 18:03.583
Chase, map out an urban
search and rescue.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.855
We'll go mile by mile,
state by state if we have to.

18:05.855 --> 18:09.189
Mr. Davenport,
what if we're too late?

18:09.189 --> 18:10.820
That glitch could've
geo-leaped them anywhere.

18:10.820 --> 18:12.922
They could be at
the bottom of the ocean

18:12.922 --> 18:15.265
or inside
an active volcano.

18:15.265 --> 18:16.966
They may already be gone.

18:16.966 --> 18:19.169
We're not giving up.

18:20.430 --> 18:21.931
Hello?

18:21.931 --> 18:23.433
Daniel, where are you?

18:23.433 --> 18:25.475
Listen, I don't have
 much time.

18:25.475 --> 18:28.007
The lady hacked into our chips
 and geo-leaped us here.

18:28.007 --> 18:29.679
She had us trapped,
 but I busted out.

18:29.679 --> 18:31.110
Place looks familiar.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.612
That's Giselle's lab.

18:32.612 --> 18:35.415
Hey, what do you
 think you're doing?

18:35.415 --> 18:37.687
How did you escape?

18:38.988 --> 18:40.420
Dad, hurry!

18:41.921 --> 18:44.023
Say good-bye
 to your son, Douglas.

18:46.025 --> 18:47.597
Everybody suit up.

18:56.266 --> 18:58.107
Adam, Bree, Chase and I
will go this way.

18:58.107 --> 18:59.839
Douglas, you and Leo
take the other side.

19:00.810 --> 19:05.014
- Guys!
- Daniel, you're okay.

19:05.014 --> 19:06.176
Where are the students?

19:06.176 --> 19:07.417
Hiding in the other room.

19:07.417 --> 19:09.579
Come on.

19:12.922 --> 19:15.325
Wow! Man.

19:15.325 --> 19:18.888
This place is fancy.

19:18.888 --> 19:21.661
Don't worry.
I have the name
of her decorator.

19:21.661 --> 19:22.832
- Really?
- No!

19:23.993 --> 19:25.365
Where are they?

19:26.996 --> 19:28.498
The doors are locking.

19:28.498 --> 19:30.370
What's going on?

19:37.076 --> 19:39.309
Well, well, well.

19:39.309 --> 19:43.483
So nice to see
the family all together.

19:43.483 --> 19:46.256
Giselle, you got
five seconds to tell me

19:46.256 --> 19:48.988
where the rest of the kids are
before I blast you.

19:48.988 --> 19:51.491
One thousand one.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.022
One thousand two.

19:53.022 --> 19:55.194
One thousand three,
one thousand four.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.867
( gasps )
There they are.

20:00.900 --> 20:03.072
How is Daniel in there
and out here?

20:03.072 --> 20:06.005
This is just like
the last time we were here
with the two Chases.

20:06.005 --> 20:07.837
This lady
and her magic tricks.

20:07.837 --> 20:09.409
She gets me
every time.

20:10.910 --> 20:12.542
It's a trap.

20:14.083 --> 20:16.145
That's not my son.

20:16.145 --> 20:18.147
That's where
you're wrong.

20:18.147 --> 20:22.652
I am your son,
just not the one you think.

20:29.999 --> 20:32.332
Marcus?

20:32.332 --> 20:34.504
Good to see ya...

20:34.504 --> 20:36.666
Dad.

20:47.817 --> 20:49.719
How's your plan
coming along?

20:49.719 --> 20:51.080
I'm trying to calm
them down with small talk,

20:51.080 --> 20:53.152
but every time I ask
where they grew up,

20:53.152 --> 20:54.824
they all say
"I don't know,
I don't remember."

20:54.824 --> 20:57.026
Where did you
grow up, Bob?

20:57.026 --> 20:58.988
I don't know.
I don't remember.

21:01.090 --> 21:03.262
There. When I touch
these two wires together,

21:03.262 --> 21:05.295
the force of the charge
should be enough

21:05.295 --> 21:06.966
to blast a hole
in the wall.

21:06.966 --> 21:09.168
Sounds good.
You sure it'll work?

21:09.168 --> 21:10.900
- Nope.
- I like those odds.

21:15.104 --> 21:17.877
Daniel! Are you okay?

21:17.877 --> 21:20.980
Talk to me.
What do you see?

21:20.980 --> 21:23.713
I see an open field.

21:23.713 --> 21:26.456
Blue skies.

21:26.456 --> 21:28.558
( gasps )
He's outside.

21:28.558 --> 21:30.890
He escaped.

21:30.890 --> 21:33.062
He's a genius.
