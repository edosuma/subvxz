Good choice.
Hey.

30:10.142 --> 30:11.848
You're back.

30:13.187 --> 30:15.894
Did you find what
you were looking for?

30:17.108 --> 30:19.599
My resignation.

30:19.694 --> 30:22.982

No.

30:33.290 --> 30:35.281
I know what I have
to do now.

30:48.639 --> 30:52.928
You must pray for guidance.
This is your path.

You must help her.

No.

32:03.547 --> 32:05.538
So...

32:08.052 --> 32:09.588
You can fly?
Yeah.

I can't believe
this is happening.
Yeah.

32:21.690 --> 32:24.682

something.

Costa Verde is gone.

this tremendous loss

with my friend here.

33:42.730 --> 33:46.518
Two hundred thousand

in Costa Verde.

This whole world. It doesn't
have to be like this, Claire.

34:09.673 --> 34:11.288
You don't
have to be like this.

I'd like a moment
with my brother alone.

34:31.320 --> 34:33.732
Is this the President
or my father speaking?

34:33.822 --> 34:34.811
Both.

34:50.130 --> 34:52.997
I know what
you're doing.
I've seen it.

34:53.342 --> 34:55.674
The world splitting in half.

34:57.346 --> 34:59.883
I'm not ignorant.
I've seen the paintings.

34:59.974 --> 35:02.056
I've heard the dreams.
I know what's going on.

35:05.688 --> 35:10.899
You're strong, Pete.
But one man cannot
save the world.

35:11.026 --> 35:12.857
lt's everybody's
responsibility.

35:12.945 --> 35:15.277
Everybody with abilities.

35:15.364 --> 35:19.482
Yeah, an army
with abilities.

35:21.704 --> 35:26.915
Congress has agreed to
full proliferation because
of Costa Verde.

35:27.001 --> 35:28.207
Because of you.

35:31.380 --> 35:34.622
Now, I know you think
people can't be trusted.

35:34.717 --> 35:37.049
That we're all greedy
and power-hungry.

35:38.345 --> 35:41.837
But we were created
in God's image, Pete.

35:41.932 --> 35:44.389
There's a goodness to man.

Pete.

You don't trust me.

35:51.734 --> 35:54.271
You've been manipulated
before by Linderman.

35:54.403 --> 35:55.813
You were going to
blow up New York City.

35:55.904 --> 35:57.690

this totem supposed
to look like anyway?

about this formula?

lead to disaster.
