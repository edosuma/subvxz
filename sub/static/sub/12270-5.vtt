00:00.080 --> 00:05.120
-Previously, on The Evermoor Chronicles.
-Something has come out of the ring.

00:05.320 --> 00:09.680
The Supreme Everine
will lose her power to another.

00:09.880 --> 00:11.200
-No!
-Who are they?

00:11.400 --> 00:13.920
The Founders. The first Everines.

00:14.040 --> 00:18.680
The moment I take
the Supreme Powers for myself

00:18.880 --> 00:23.320
and rule Evermoor!

00:25.360 --> 00:28.960
# I left my friends for my new life

00:29.080 --> 00:32.080
# How will I know it's gonna be all right?

00:32.280 --> 00:37.680
# I got to take control
And write my destiny

00:38.960 --> 00:41.480
# The future's still untold

00:41.600 --> 00:44.320
# Nobody else can see

00:44.480 --> 00:50.120
# If this will be for Evermoor #

00:53.480 --> 00:55.880
(STONE GRINDING THEN THUD SOUND)

00:57.520 --> 01:00.480
This was here the whole time?

01:00.600 --> 01:05.480
So the good news is I found the symbol
that can turn Cameron and his mom back.

01:05.640 --> 01:08.360
This is wonderful! Tara, you’ve done it!

01:08.480 --> 01:12.280
-Everything’s going to be okay.
-I gave my powers away.

01:12.440 --> 01:15.440
I didn’t trust myself
and gave my powers

01:15.560 --> 01:18.280
to someone whose plan
was to steal them.

01:18.440 --> 01:20.040
But who?

01:23.120 --> 01:28.120
(FOOTSTEPS)

01:30.400 --> 01:31.680
(METAL CLANKING)

01:33.320 --> 01:37.960
# Weave tomorrow today my sisters

01:38.080 --> 01:43.200
# Deeds undone words unsaid

01:43.400 --> 01:47.880
# As the eye that guides the needle

01:48.000 --> 01:50.440
# the hand that cuts the thread #

01:50.560 --> 01:54.400
Is that Everine McCoy?

01:54.520 --> 01:56.640
But she’s...

01:56.840 --> 01:59.280
She’s--
Dead.

01:59.440 --> 02:03.680
But you’ve broken every sacred vow
of the Everines.

02:03.880 --> 02:05.440
(GIGGLES)

02:05.560 --> 02:09.280
For what, Aunt Bridget?
Agatha?

02:09.440 --> 02:12.280
Your Circle took her away from me.

02:12.440 --> 02:17.360
My big sister Agatha was everything
I wanted to be, Tara.

02:17.480 --> 02:21.160
When I was a little girl,
before I was Chosen,

02:21.360 --> 02:25.440
the tapestry predicted Agatha
would be lost on the moors.

02:25.560 --> 02:27.960
Did they warn her? No.

02:29.120 --> 02:32.480
They let her walk
right down that bog path,

02:32.640 --> 02:34.520
and they never said a word!

02:34.680 --> 02:39.440
It is Circle law not to disclose
all predictions. It is Fate.

02:40.920 --> 02:47.160
Well, I had a promise to keep to Agatha.
That one day I would put things right.

02:47.360 --> 02:50.560
-No matter how long it took.
-Put things right?

02:50.760 --> 02:54.360
You can’t bring her back.
You know that better than anyone.

02:54.480 --> 02:58.000
No. But with these powers,
I can create a new Evermoor.

02:58.160 --> 03:02.000
The tapestry will fix lives,
not ruin them.

03:02.120 --> 03:03.920
What is this, Aunt Bridget?

03:04.040 --> 03:07.480
It’s not finished yet.
But when it is, rest assured,

03:07.600 --> 03:11.440
Evermoor will be changed forever!

03:11.560 --> 03:13.960
(LIGHTNING THEN ELECTRICITY SOUND)

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
What’s happening to your hands?

03:17.120 --> 03:22.000
She is not Fated.
Her body cannot contain the Supreme magic.

03:22.120 --> 03:23.600
(CLANKING)

03:23.800 --> 03:27.280
Tara we should leave,
it’s not safe to stay.

03:27.440 --> 03:28.520
(WIND BLOWING)

03:28.680 --> 03:31.000
(THEN CLANKING THEN SUSPENSE)

03:31.120 --> 03:34.800
-Aunt Bridget, it’s not too late--
-Get out!

03:49.440 --> 03:52.000
Hey, America.

03:52.120 --> 03:55.360
I wanted to talk to you
about Ludo’s birthday.

03:55.480 --> 03:57.160
Ludo’s having a birthday?

03:57.360 --> 03:59.400
Why haven’t I heard about it?

04:00.400 --> 04:03.320
Because it’s a surprise birthday.

04:03.480 --> 04:06.160
He’s having a surprise party
after school.

04:06.360 --> 04:08.440
It’s fancy dress. His mum’s idea.

04:08.560 --> 04:10.320
-What’s the theme?
-Babies.

04:10.480 --> 04:13.000
-What?
-Ludo loves babies.

04:13.160 --> 04:16.000
Who’s known him longer.
What’s his middle name?

04:16.160 --> 04:17.840
Ahem. I don’t know.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.200
Shelby. Now, don’t disappoint him.

04:20.400 --> 04:23.600
Oh, and it’s top secret, okay?
No blurting.

04:23.800 --> 04:25.280
Got it.

04:32.160 --> 04:34.120
-Where’s Cameron?
-Huh?

04:34.320 --> 04:36.480
He’s not in school today.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.800
He’s probably sick.

04:38.960 --> 04:40.000
(SNIFF)

04:40.160 --> 04:44.160
Either Meatballs are on the menu
for lunch today, or you’re lying.

04:44.360 --> 04:47.560
Why is Seb walking
like his whole world, and hair,

04:47.760 --> 04:49.520
have been turned upside down?

04:53.840 --> 04:56.040
I must check if he’s all right.

04:56.200 --> 04:59.480
Hmm, meatballs equals lies.

05:04.680 --> 05:09.000
I turned Cameron into a tree, Bella.
And I can’t turn him back.

05:09.120 --> 05:11.400
-I gave Bridget my powers--
-Bridget?

05:11.520 --> 05:14.520
-Aunt Bridget? Dead Aunt Bridget--
-Shhh!

05:14.680 --> 05:16.120
We’ve been hanging out.

05:16.320 --> 05:21.120
She’s been secretly helping me
with my powers until she tricked me.

05:21.320 --> 05:25.440
Oh, Tara, I can smell your regret.
And it does not smell pleasant.

05:26.440 --> 05:27.560
Now look at us.

05:27.760 --> 05:31.520
I have no powers.
You have magic nostrils...

05:33.680 --> 05:35.360
What?

05:35.480 --> 05:36.840
The rip.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.160
Remember Cotton? She came out
because she was once predicted.

05:41.360 --> 05:42.480
Well, so was I.

05:42.640 --> 05:45.520
Our arrival was predicted
on the tapestry.

05:45.680 --> 05:51.000
That means there’s a version of me
in there. With my Supreme powers.

05:51.160 --> 05:55.440
If we pull that Tara out,
we can use her to restore everything.

05:55.560 --> 05:59.880
Tara, I can barely deal with one of you.
(TWINKLING)

06:00.960 --> 06:05.320
Jake’s having a birthday?
Why haven’t I heard about it?

06:05.480 --> 06:09.080
Oh, it’s a surprise party.
It’s fancy dress. His mom’s idea.

06:09.280 --> 06:11.000
-What’s the theme?
-Mermaids.

06:11.160 --> 06:12.320
Awesome.

06:14.520 --> 06:18.000
Do we just reach in,
like when you deliver a baby calf?

06:19.400 --> 06:21.520
See, this is why I wanted Sorsha.

06:21.680 --> 06:24.000
Thanks to Seb I got you.

06:24.120 --> 06:27.040
We got Cotton Lively out
by talking about her.

06:27.200 --> 06:29.800
When I went to get you,
I said your name.

06:29.960 --> 06:33.920
When the Circle make a prediction,
they ask a question, right?

06:34.040 --> 06:36.640
As the weaver sews,
the Circle concentrate.

06:36.840 --> 06:39.920
All we do is concentrate on your name.

06:40.040 --> 06:42.480
Okay, concentrate, Circle.

06:45.160 --> 06:46.960
(BLOWING)

06:47.080 --> 06:51.080
Oh, tapestry, great tapestry,
please can you send us--

06:51.280 --> 06:54.480
Tallulah Brinkworth encyclopedia, anyone?

06:54.600 --> 06:58.880
Tara, have you seen it?
It’s missing from my desk. Ah!

07:00.400 --> 07:02.960
Needed a little inspiration, huh?
Uh-huh.

07:03.080 --> 07:06.840
I forgot what
her Uncle Bosworth's name is,

07:07.000 --> 07:11.000
can you believe that?
Oh, there it is. Well, I did write it.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.080
(VANISHING SOUND)

07:16.600 --> 07:19.800
What temple of haberdashery is this?

07:19.960 --> 07:21.160
That’s not me.

07:22.640 --> 07:27.560
-Oh! That’s Tallulah Brinkworth!
-Tallulah Brinkworth’s in there too?

07:27.760 --> 07:31.320
Mom’s books were once predicted
on the tapestry.

07:31.480 --> 07:33.840
I’m looking for Captain Easterly,

07:34.000 --> 07:36.480
have you seen him? It’s very important.

07:36.600 --> 07:39.120
He has information about the codex.

07:39.320 --> 07:43.440
And some unfinished business.

07:43.560 --> 07:46.640
I’m sorry, terribly rude of me.

07:46.840 --> 07:48.360
Brinkworth’s the name!

07:48.480 --> 07:51.360
-Hello!
-Hello!

07:54.520 --> 07:57.400
Tara, she looks just like you.

07:57.520 --> 08:01.120
My mom based her on me.
Some Circle you are.

08:01.320 --> 08:07.040
-Me? I’m not the one who blurted her name.
-Now we have to get her back in...

08:07.200 --> 08:09.000
Uh-oh.

08:17.840 --> 08:19.200
Split up!

08:26.040 --> 08:27.360
Howdy!

08:27.560 --> 08:31.000
I’m looking for Captain Easterly.
Have you seen him?

08:32.000 --> 08:36.560
Been peeking at my latest chapter?
You know we are not supposed to do that.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.560
(CLANKING)

08:44.720 --> 08:47.280
Tallulah, come back
to the tapestry room.

08:47.440 --> 08:52.120
I must find Captain Easterly.
Captain Easterly doesn’t exist.

08:52.280 --> 08:55.240
-Baba Yaga sent you to lie to me.
-Baba-what-now?

08:55.400 --> 09:00.400
She obviously didn’t talk about my gift
for the art of distraction. Look!

09:01.520 --> 09:03.240
Oh, mother of pearls. Wait!

09:03.400 --> 09:05.000
(LAUGHING)

09:08.080 --> 09:12.000
-Did you just change?
-Uh, yeah.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.280
I can take you to Captain Easterly!

09:15.440 --> 09:19.520
I know where he is. We need to hurry.
Baby Yoga's on your tail.

09:19.680 --> 09:21.320
-Baba Yaga?
-Right.

09:26.880 --> 09:29.520
-That is weird.
-No, it’s not.

09:30.520 --> 09:33.560
No more reading my books
before they’re finished.

09:33.720 --> 09:38.120
You can find out what happens
with Captain Easterly, when it’s finished.

09:40.760 --> 09:42.600
"When it’s finished."

09:47.600 --> 09:50.040
I’m a rational person, Sorsha.
All this--

09:50.200 --> 09:54.840
There’s a rational word for this
and that word is bizarro.

09:55.000 --> 10:01.840
Well, if you can’t be bizarro,
then I shall be rational.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.440
From now on,
I’ll be a regular outside world girl.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.880
(CLANKING THEN BELL RINGS)
I promise.

10:11.760 --> 10:12.760
(DOOR BANG)

10:13.760 --> 10:15.440
Tara.

10:15.640 --> 10:19.960
Now, why do people keep calling me that?
Are you an agent of Baba Yaga?

10:20.080 --> 10:22.080
She’s not an agent of Baba Yaga.

10:22.240 --> 10:23.880
Something went wrong.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.640
-Wrong with what?
-Nothing.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.800
-Tara?
-Where have you been?

10:28.960 --> 10:31.680
Avoiding. You know
she speaks five languages?

10:31.840 --> 10:34.880
I think your mum
is trying to make a better you.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.160
Is that Captain Easterly?

10:38.320 --> 10:39.800
Yes.

10:39.960 --> 10:41.640
Ask him if he remembers me.

10:41.800 --> 10:44.640
No, don’t. I want to see his face.

10:44.800 --> 10:46.320
Tara, do something quick.

10:46.520 --> 10:50.960
Bella, Tallulah is the Tallulah
from the book mom is writing right now.

10:51.080 --> 10:52.720
Yeah, so?

10:52.880 --> 10:54.920
Tell me if she does anything.

10:55.040 --> 10:59.360

(BARKING)

11:03.960 --> 11:05.560
What did you do?

11:05.720 --> 11:09.520
Tallulah’s fictional,
so she's controlled by my mom’s laptop.

11:09.680 --> 11:12.880
We have to rewrite Tallulah
with the Supreme powers.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.000
She can stop Bridget, restore Cameron,
and put everything back.

11:17.160 --> 11:20.240
It's foolproof! There.
Are her fingers lighting up?

11:21.320 --> 11:23.520
(GROANS WHIMSICALLY)
Yeah-huh.

11:23.680 --> 11:26.280
We have ourselves a Supreme Tallulah!

11:26.440 --> 11:29.000
Now don’t let her out of your sight.

11:29.120 --> 11:32.280
Take her to Captain Easterly.
I’ve got just the guy.

11:32.440 --> 11:35.920
He’ll be waiting for you
in the snoot cage on the green.

This is Captain Easterly?

11:59.040 --> 12:01.040
Apparently.

12:02.160 --> 12:03.440
You look different.

12:03.640 --> 12:07.040
We only met for a moment,
but it felt like a day.

12:07.200 --> 12:10.920
I’m a little disappointed too.
I expected him to be taller.

12:11.920 --> 12:13.800
I remember, when we parted,

12:13.960 --> 12:17.680
you stopped and turned
as if you were about to say something.

12:17.840 --> 12:21.000
-What were you about to say?
-Um...

You're a Scorpio, of course.

12:39.240 --> 12:40.960

Well? Did she buy it?

13:21.680 --> 13:25.440
You convince Tallulah to follow you
and sew my powers back.

13:25.640 --> 13:28.400
I stop Bridget
and then we bring Cameron back.

really? That’s not Evermoorian.

-A dinglehorn.

13:56.680 --> 13:58.960
You mean apart from right now? No.

14:03.800 --> 14:06.960
I don’t understand.
Tallulah found Captain Easterly.

14:07.080 --> 14:10.920
-Why'd she leave?
-She found her hero living in a bird cage.

Don’t know if you’ve heard of me.
I am a sacred snoot.

You’re kind of mean.

No.

14:26.320 --> 14:27.720
Oh, thank you.

14:27.880 --> 14:31.160
Yeah, they were all over my desk.
(CHUCKLES)

14:33.080 --> 14:36.080
Oh, no. Bridget.

14:38.280 --> 14:40.960
Think I can’t break out of here,
Baba Yaga?

14:41.080 --> 14:43.320
I know a lot about escapology.

14:45.160 --> 14:48.560
"You know nothing about escapology."

14:51.000 --> 14:54.120
I know literally nothing about escapology.

(METAL CLANKING)
You are, however, a master embroiderer.

14:59.280 --> 15:03.240
And I need that more than anything.

15:10.800 --> 15:11.800
Her hands.

15:11.960 --> 15:16.320
-Bridget wants to finish what she started.
-There’ll be no stopping her.

15:16.520 --> 15:20.760
-We put Tallulah back in the tapestry?
-(SIGHS) Amateur. You can’t.

15:23.000 --> 15:27.080
Just go. Really. It’s okay.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.440
Cotton Lively.
I’m guessing you’ve got a tapestry leaker.

15:37.640 --> 15:42.280
Cotton came out of the tapestry too.
You got rid of her by completing her,

15:42.440 --> 15:45.200
giving her what she wants.
If for Tallulah,

15:45.360 --> 15:48.920
she’ll disappear like Cotton.
Bridget will be powerless.

15:49.040 --> 15:52.000
-Obvious when put like that.
-Oh, wait. Bridget?

15:52.120 --> 15:55.120
Long story.
So how do we complete Tallulah?

15:59.840 --> 16:02.880
You find out how Tallulah’s story ends.

16:08.360 --> 16:12.800
Mom, hi. I know I’m not supposed to know
before it’s finished,

16:12.960 --> 16:16.800
but, can you tell me
how this Tallulah book ends? Please?

16:19.240 --> 16:21.000
With a kiss.

16:21.120 --> 16:23.880
Really? Who?

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
Captain Easterly.

16:26.160 --> 16:27.760
Oh...

16:27.920 --> 16:32.280
Captain Easterly, of course.
Tallulah gets a kiss before I do?

16:32.440 --> 16:36.200
-Yes, yes she does.
-You really are writing a better me.

(MAGICAL CASTING SOUND)

17:20.240 --> 17:22.640
A new tapestry.

17:22.800 --> 17:27.320
And everything will become perfect!

17:35.720 --> 17:39.040
My Evermoor!

17:44.240 --> 17:46.720
Why doesn't it work?

17:46.880 --> 17:49.400
It requires a touch from the demigod,

17:49.600 --> 17:53.000
like the original tapestry did
a thousand years ago.

17:53.120 --> 17:55.280
(MAGICAL SOUND)

17:55.440 --> 17:58.720
We will tell you
where to find such a being,

17:58.880 --> 18:02.760
but first you have to do something for us.

18:02.920 --> 18:05.080
You will give us your essence.

18:06.200 --> 18:08.160
We will deliver you a demigod,

18:08.320 --> 18:12.240
and in exchange,
you will bring us back to life.

18:12.400 --> 18:17.240
Only then can your essence
be returned to you.

18:18.920 --> 18:22.800
Baba Yaga. I should warn you,
this deal sounds a little shaky.

18:26.520 --> 18:28.640
(WIND SOUND)

18:33.400 --> 18:37.680
Now tell me.
Tell me where I will find a demigod.

18:37.840 --> 18:42.880
The demigod that
ignited the original tapestry has a son,

18:43.000 --> 18:45.400
and that boy's name is Otto.

18:46.920 --> 18:49.520
He is the demigod you seek.

I just got used to the tree thing.

19:04.400 --> 19:07.000
Captain Easterly! I knew you’d come.

19:07.160 --> 19:12.120
You kiss her.
She disappears. We stop Bridget.

19:12.280 --> 19:14.800
Take one for the team, Otto.
(PATS)

19:16.760 --> 19:18.120
Tallulah...

19:20.120 --> 19:24.400
What was it you were going to say
that day you walked away?

19:24.600 --> 19:26.360
I was going to say...

19:27.960 --> 19:30.200
I hope I see you again.

20:45.120 --> 20:49.160
Why does the life she’s replacing
sound so horrible?

20:49.320 --> 20:51.560
Got your new Evermoor.

20:51.720 --> 20:54.720

three Fated villagers to inhabit.
