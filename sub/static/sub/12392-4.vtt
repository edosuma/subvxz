WEBVTT

00:10.440 --> 00:12.476
DON'T SAY A WORD.

00:19.620 --> 00:20.712
FERGULOUS.

00:20.750 --> 00:22.581
SHAWN,
I SAID NO WORDS.

00:22.620 --> 00:24.315
OH, I SEE
HOW IT WORKS.

00:24.350 --> 00:26.113
TWO WEEKS AGO, WE'RE PLAYING
SCRABBLE, IT'S NOT A WORD.

00:26.160 --> 00:29.459
NOW SUDDENLY IT IS A WORD
BECAUSE IT'S CONVENIENT FOR YOU.

00:29.490 --> 00:31.583
OH, BUDDY.

00:31.630 --> 00:35.122
DUDE, YOU'VE GOT SOME PEAT MOSS
JAMMED BEHIND YOUR EAR.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.060
IT COULD BE INFESTED
WITH MITES.

00:37.100 --> 00:38.567
MITES?

00:39.800 --> 00:41.836
I LOST A $200 SHOE.

00:41.870 --> 00:43.428
YOUR DAD ALMOST GOT
HIS SKULL FRACTURED.

00:43.470 --> 00:44.664
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO GOT US INTO THIS.

00:44.710 --> 00:46.371
AND ABSOLUTELY NOTHING
HAPPENED TO YOU.

00:46.410 --> 00:47.570
WOULD YOU TWO STOP IT?

00:47.610 --> 00:50.477
I'VE BEEN ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THIS TABLE A THOUSAND TIMES.

00:50.510 --> 00:52.444
YOU TELL THEM
ONLY WHAT THEY NEED TO KNOW.

00:52.480 --> 00:53.777
WHAT DO WE SAY
ABOUT UNCLE JACK?

00:53.820 --> 00:55.447
HE'S NOT HERE,
IS HE, SHAWN?

00:55.480 --> 00:57.311
WHY DON'T WE TAKE CARE
OF OURSELVES?

00:57.350 --> 00:59.557
WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.
WE DIDN'T BREAK ANY LAWS.

01:02.660 --> 01:04.525
OH, NO.

01:04.560 --> 01:06.448
OH, NO, WHAT--
WHAT'D YOU DO, SHAWN?

01:06.500 --> 01:08.149
NOTHING.

01:08.200 --> 01:10.498
IT'S JUST THAT LAWS
KEEP CHANGING.

01:10.530 --> 01:12.395
IT'S GETTING VERY CHALLENGING
TO KEEP UP WITH THEM ALL.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.793
DID YOU KNOW,
FOR INSTANCE,

01:13.840 --> 01:17.503
THAT IT IS NOW ILLEGAL
TO GIVE A PERM TO POSSUM? WHA--

01:17.540 --> 01:20.737
SHAWN, DID YOU
OR DID YOU NOT BREAK ANY LAWS?

01:20.780 --> 01:23.601
WE IMPERSONATED PRIESTS.

01:23.650 --> 01:25.504
WHA--
WHAT?
WE WERE PROFESSORS.

01:25.550 --> 01:26.642
WE WERE PRIESTS, SHAWN.

01:26.680 --> 01:28.318
[door opens]

01:28.350 --> 01:30.341
(Vick)
YOU GENTLEMEN HAVE A LOT
OF EXPLAINING TO DO.

01:30.390 --> 01:31.482
AND YOU CAN BET YOUR ASS

01:31.520 --> 01:32.452
I'M GONNA GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

01:32.490 --> 01:34.515
DON'T I GET A PHONE CALL
OR SO'NDTHING?

01:34.560 --> 01:36.448
FINE. HOW ABOUT A TEXT MESSAGE?
I'LL BE QUICK.

01:36.490 --> 01:38.219
I JUST NEED TO RESPOND,
"OMG, LOL."

01:38.260 --> 01:39.818
HERE'S A QUESTION.

01:39.860 --> 01:41.521
HOW DO YOU MAKE
THE FACE THAT'S WINKING

01:41.560 --> 01:43.198
WITH THE TONGUE
COMING OUT ONE SIDE?

01:43.230 --> 01:44.561
(Vick)
MR. SPENCER, NOW,

01:44.600 --> 01:45.567
BY MY ESTIMATION,
YOU MAY BE IN

01:45.600 --> 01:47.295
SOME SERIOUS TROUBLE HERE.

01:47.340 --> 01:48.568
SO I AM ONLY GOING
TO ASK YOU THIS ONCE.

01:50.540 --> 01:51.837
WHERE'S THE GOLD?

01:53.710 --> 01:55.530
IT'S NOT QUITE
AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

01:55.580 --> 01:57.502
RIGHT, IF WE WERE TO REALLY
ANSWER THAT QUESTION,

01:57.550 --> 01:59.438
WE'D HAVE TO GO BACK
QUITE A WHILE.

01:59.480 --> 02:01.471
HOW LONG?

02:01.520 --> 02:03.317
ABOUT 20 YEARS.

02:05.420 --> 02:10.187
AS THE RAIN THUNDERED DOWN
FROM THE DARK NIGHT SKY

02:10.230 --> 02:13.722
AND 30-FOOT WAVES
CRASHED OVER HIS SHIP,

02:13.760 --> 02:18.459
THE GREAT PIRATE BOUCHARD
STOOD ON HIS BOW...

02:19.940 --> 02:21.464
POINTED...

02:21.500 --> 02:23.900
AT THE CALIFORNIA COAST,
AND YELLED,

02:23.940 --> 02:27.876
[French accent]
"WE SHALL TAKE THIS LAND
AS OURS, MEN!"

02:27.910 --> 02:30.470
[cheering]

02:30.510 --> 02:31.875
YOUR DAD'S AWESOME.

02:31.910 --> 02:33.343
SEE, KIDS...
I KNOW.

02:33.380 --> 02:34.870
I'M SO GLAD
MY DAD DIDN'T COME.

02:34.920 --> 02:36.410
I MEAN,
I DON'T EVEN KNOW

02:36.450 --> 02:39.578
WHAT A MANAGER OF DEBT
CONSOLIDATION DOES, ANYWAYS.

02:39.620 --> 02:41.451
EXCEPT DRINK.

02:41.490 --> 02:42.957
RUMOR HAS IT THAT

02:42.990 --> 02:46.494
BOUCHARD WAS OBSESSED

02:46.530 --> 02:51.490
WITH SEARCHING
FOR SPANISH GOLD.

02:51.530 --> 02:54.567
THEY ALSO SAY
HE MAY HAVE HAD SYPHILIS

02:54.600 --> 02:56.363
AND WENT CRAZY

02:56.410 --> 02:58.230
SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING
THAT NEVER EXISTED.

02:59.710 --> 03:01.837
BUT I SAY...

03:01.880 --> 03:06.510
THE GOLD DID EXIST!

03:06.550 --> 03:07.539
[kids gasping]

03:09.420 --> 03:10.842
OKAY, MY DAD
HAS TO GO NOW.

03:10.890 --> 03:13.552
THANKS, DAD.
SEE YOU LATER. BYE.

03:16.890 --> 03:19.393
WH--WH--WHAT THE HECK'S
GOING ON HERE?

03:19.430 --> 03:21.853
OFFICER, WE'RE JUST
IN THE MIDDLE OF A CLASS.

03:21.900 --> 03:23.561
IS THERE A PROBLEM
WITH SOMETHING?

03:23.600 --> 03:25.488
(Henry)
YES, THERE IS A PROBLEM.

03:25.530 --> 03:27.236
THAT'S NOT SHAWN'S DAD,

03:27.270 --> 03:29.534
'CAUSE I'M
SHAWN SPENCER'S FATHER.

03:29.570 --> 03:30.901
YOU'RE NOT SHAWN'S DAD?

03:30.940 --> 03:33.408
UH, WELL, UH, YOU KNOW
[chuckles] TECHNICALLY.

03:33.440 --> 03:35.579
UH, TECHNICALLY,
THAT IS MY BROTHER JACK,

03:35.610 --> 03:37.305
WHO TECHNICALLY DIDN'T TELL ME
HE WAS COMING TO TOWN

03:37.350 --> 03:39.841
AND OBVIOUSLY COOKED UP
THIS RUSE WITH SHAWN

03:39.880 --> 03:41.814
TO FOOL HIS NEW TEACHER.

03:43.620 --> 03:44.644
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
I DON'T KNOW.

03:44.690 --> 03:48.410
I JUST THOUGHT IT'D BE COOLER
IF UNCLE JACK SPOKE.

03:48.460 --> 03:51.588
LOOK, CLASS, I'M SORRY
TO BREAK THIS TO YOU, BUT...

03:51.630 --> 03:53.598
HE'S NOT A REAL
TREASURE HUNTER, AND THIS...

03:55.530 --> 03:56.599
IS NOT REAL GOLD.

03:56.630 --> 03:58.495
(class)
AWW...

03:58.530 --> 03:59.758
KIDS, MY BIG BROTHER HENRY

03:59.800 --> 04:01.791
IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

04:01.840 --> 04:04.729
THIS IS NOT REAL GOLD.

04:05.640 --> 04:08.837
BUT IT IS REAL CHOCOLATE!

04:08.880 --> 04:10.438
[cheering]

04:10.480 --> 04:11.970
[laughter]

04:12.010 --> 04:14.649
(Lassiter)
WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO
WITH THE GOLD?

04:14.680 --> 04:16.819
RELAX, LASSIDOPHILUS,
WE'RE GETTING THERE.

04:16.850 --> 04:18.317
LAST NIGHT...

04:18.350 --> 04:19.988
WHAT CAN I SAY?
THE MOVIE DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

04:20.020 --> 04:21.749
OF COURSE IT DIDN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE TO YOU.

04:21.790 --> 04:23.826
YOU CAME IN 20 MINUTES LATE,
FELL ASLEEP FOR AN HOUR,

04:23.860 --> 04:25.555
THEN WOKE UP
AND ASKED ME WHAT HAPPENED.

04:25.590 --> 04:26.818
YOU ALWAYS DO THIS.
WHAT CAN I SAY?

04:26.860 --> 04:28.350
THE MOVIE THEATER'S
TOO DAMN DARK.

04:28.400 --> 04:29.321
IT MAKES ME SLEEPY.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.691
SO BASICALLY I PAID $10
FOR YOU TO TAKE A NAP.

04:31.730 --> 04:32.992
BASICALLY, I PAID--

04:36.470 --> 04:37.630
DAD, SOMEONE'S
IN THE HOUSE.

04:39.910 --> 04:41.707
OH, MY GOD.
LET'S CALL THE COPS.

04:41.740 --> 04:43.207
WE SHOULD CALL THE COPS.

04:47.080 --> 04:48.843
YOU KEEP A STUN GUN
IN THE BIRDHOUSE?

04:48.880 --> 04:51.019
WHAT'S UNDER
THE GARDEN GNOME, AN M-80?

04:53.120 --> 04:55.884
YOU WANT ME TO POKE YOU
IN THE EYES ON THE ROOF?

05:01.060 --> 05:02.869
WE'RE CALLING
THE COPS, RIGHT?

05:02.900 --> 05:04.697
[sighs]

05:05.630 --> 05:07.598
WHY AREN'T WE CALLING
THE COPS?

05:30.630 --> 05:31.881
DAD, WAIT.

05:31.930 --> 05:33.329
STOP!

05:35.130 --> 05:36.427
UNCLE JACK!

05:36.470 --> 05:37.926
I KNEW IT WAS YOU

05:37.970 --> 05:39.665
AS SOON AS I SAW THE PENNY.

05:39.700 --> 05:43.067
HA HA HA! THE KID!
SHAWN, MY BOY.

05:43.110 --> 05:45.533
HEY. AND BY THE WAY,
THAT'S A '59 PENNY.

05:45.570 --> 05:47.606
IT'S THE FIRST YEAR THEY USED
THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL ON IT.

05:47.640 --> 05:49.779
I WANT YOU TO KEEP IT.
THANKS, MAN.

05:49.810 --> 05:51.778
AAAH!

05:51.810 --> 05:52.845
JACK?

05:52.880 --> 05:53.869
DUDE. A HOSE, REALLY?

05:53.920 --> 05:54.909
WHAT WERE YOU GONNA DO,
GIVE HIM A HIGH COLONIC?

05:54.950 --> 05:57.145
SHUT UP, SHAWN.
NO, NO, NO, NO.
I GET IT.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.511
YOU BUST IN HERE,
YOU BLIND HIM WITH WATER,

05:59.560 --> 06:00.959
AND THEN YOU MAKE
YOUR MOVE, BABY.

06:00.990 --> 06:02.423
COME HERE, YOU!

06:02.460 --> 06:03.927
OH, BOY.

06:03.960 --> 06:04.858
IT SEEMS LIKE ONLY YESTERDAY

06:04.890 --> 06:06.755
I WAS BRINGING YOU KIDS
TO THE TRACK,

06:06.800 --> 06:07.994
AND WE WERE BETTING
THE PONIES.

06:08.030 --> 06:10.021
I WAS THE ONLY 8-YEAR-OLD KID
WHO KNEW WHAT A TRIFECT A MEANT.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.128
YEAH.

06:11.170 --> 06:12.569
UNCLE JACK,
I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOU

06:12.600 --> 06:13.760
SINCE YOU SENT THAT E-MAIL

06:13.800 --> 06:15.768
FROM PRINCE ALBERT'S BOAT
IN THE MALDIVES.

06:15.800 --> 06:16.698
YEAH, WELL, I HAD TO SIGN

06:16.740 --> 06:18.537
A CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT
THERE, GUYS.

06:18.570 --> 06:19.901
CAN'T REALLY TALK ABOUT IT.

06:19.940 --> 06:22.033
OOH! BY THE WAY,
I GOT PRESENTS FOR EVERYBODY.

06:22.080 --> 06:23.570
HEY, HEY, HEY!

06:25.480 --> 06:29.746
I GOT THESE WHEN I WAS
EXCAVATING NEAR MACHU PICCHU.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.485
WHOA.
DUG THEM UP MYSELF.

06:34.490 --> 06:36.082
[both growling]

06:36.120 --> 06:37.451
(Henry)
IT'S BEEN THREE YEARS, JACK.

06:37.490 --> 06:38.525
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE

06:38.560 --> 06:40.050
BESIDES BREAKING INTO
MY HOUSE?

06:40.100 --> 06:41.920
BREAKING IN.
YOU GAVE ME A KEY, HENRY.

06:41.960 --> 06:43.166
I DIDN'T GIVE YOU A KEY.

06:43.200 --> 06:44.599
I DON'T GIVE ANYONE KEYS,
NOT EVEN SHAWN.

06:44.630 --> 06:46.029
(Shawn)
OH, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

06:46.070 --> 06:47.935
I ACTUALLY MADE A COPY
A WHILE BACK.

06:47.970 --> 06:49.858
IT WAS WHEN I WAS HOOKED
ON WOW WOW WUBBZY ON NOGGIN.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.036
I DIDN'T HAVE CABLE.

06:51.070 --> 06:52.606
OH, I ALSO STOLE YOUR
TOILET PAPER

06:52.640 --> 06:54.733
FOR ABOUT A YEAR,
AND A HUGE BOX OF SPORKS.

06:54.780 --> 06:56.031
OH...

06:56.080 --> 06:59.140
I GUESS YOU ARE WONDERING
WHY I CAME BACK.

07:01.920 --> 07:05.947
I WANT YOU TO HELP ME FIND
BOUCHARD'S TREASURE.

07:05.990 --> 07:07.810
(Henry)
COME ON.
NOT THAT AGAIN, JACK.

07:07.860 --> 07:09.179
I HATE TO BREAK IT TO YOU,
LITTLE BROTHER,

07:09.220 --> 07:12.553
BUT BOUCHARD'S TREASURE
DOES NOT, HAS NOT,

07:12.600 --> 07:14.591
AND WILL NOT EVER EXIST.

07:14.630 --> 07:15.995
IT'S A PIPE DREAM.

07:16.030 --> 07:18.624
DON'T LISTEN TO HIM, UNCLE JACK.
HE'S A DREAM KILLER.

07:18.670 --> 07:20.729
AH, I UNDERSTAND
HIS FRUSTRATION.

07:20.770 --> 07:23.034
ALL THOSE YEARS SPENT
LISTENING TO ME DRONE ON

07:23.070 --> 07:24.901
ABOUT THE WHOLE
"TREASURE" THING

07:24.940 --> 07:26.828
WITHOUT EVEN A SEMBLANCE
OF PROOF.

07:26.880 --> 07:27.972
I GET IT.

07:29.080 --> 07:31.742
ONE THING
CONFUSES ME, THOUGH.

07:31.780 --> 07:33.714
IF IT IS JUST A FIGMENT

07:33.750 --> 07:35.968
OF MY IMAGINATION...

07:38.250 --> 07:40.889
WHERE'D I GET THIS?

07:43.760 --> 07:47.696
[The Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

07:47.730 --> 07:49.220
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

07:49.260 --> 07:51.125
* THAT I'M NOT TELLING
THE TRUTH *

07:51.170 --> 07:52.694
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

07:52.740 --> 07:54.139
* THEY JUST DON'T HAVE
ANY PROOF *

07:54.170 --> 07:55.660
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

07:55.700 --> 07:57.702
* LEARN HOW TO BEND

07:57.740 --> 07:59.264
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS

07:59.310 --> 08:01.870
* TEND TO PSYCH YOU OUT
IN THE END *

08:01.910 --> 08:12.218
* I KNOW YOU KNOW *

08:12.250 --> 08:15.083
WHY DO I FEEL
LIKE HE CAN SEE US?

08:20.130 --> 08:23.122
NO, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
HE CAN'T SEE OR HEAR A THING.

08:28.770 --> 08:30.067
THAT'S JUST WEIRD.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.202
SO, WHAT, WE'RE JUST
GONNA LET THIS GUY

08:31.240 --> 08:32.935
LISTEN IN ON EVERYTHING?

08:32.980 --> 08:35.198
(Vick)
IT'S OUT OF OUR HANDS,
DETECTIVE.

08:35.240 --> 08:37.879
NOW JUST GET IN THERE
AND GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

08:37.910 --> 08:39.070
YOU GOT IT.

08:42.650 --> 08:44.914
WHEN ARE WE GONNA FIND OUT
THE DEAL WITH SUIT GUY IN THERE?

08:46.250 --> 08:48.013
LET'S JUST GET

08:48.060 --> 08:49.118
BACK TO THE STORY.

08:52.360 --> 08:56.023
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOUR UNCLE JACK
ACTUALLY HAD A TREASURE MAP.

08:56.060 --> 08:57.061
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU ACTUALLY PRETENDED

08:57.100 --> 08:58.089
YOUR UNCLE WAS YOUR DAD.

08:58.130 --> 08:59.290
I WANTED GUS' DAD
TO DO IT,

08:59.330 --> 09:00.638
BUT THERE WAS A GENEALOGY ISSUE

09:00.670 --> 09:01.694
I JUST COULDN'T RESOLVE.

09:01.740 --> 09:02.866
WHAT ELSE CAN YOU TELL US

09:02.910 --> 09:04.036
ABOUT THE BOUCHARD GUY?

09:04.070 --> 09:05.799
WE COULD ONLY REMEMBER
BITS AND PIECES

09:05.840 --> 09:07.831
OF THE BOUCHARD MYTH,
BUT JACK

09:07.880 --> 09:08.869
FILLED US IN ON THE REST.

09:08.910 --> 09:11.208
(Jack)
NOVEMBER, 1818.

09:11.250 --> 09:14.344
BOUCHARD SAILED UP AND DOWN
THE CALIFORNIA COAST,

09:14.380 --> 09:18.339
SEARCHING DESPERATELY
FOR THE MYTHICAL SPANISH GOLD.

09:18.390 --> 09:21.052
HE RAVAGED AND LOOTED
THE MISSION IN MONTEREY,

09:21.090 --> 09:23.229
WAS REPELLED
AT SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO,

09:23.260 --> 09:25.649
AND FINALLY MADE LAND HERE,
AT SANTA BARBARA,

09:25.690 --> 09:28.158
WHERE HE DID BATTLE
WITH A SMALL SPANISH GARRISON

09:28.200 --> 09:30.327
AND THE CHUMASH INDIANS.

09:30.370 --> 09:33.066
YEAH, I REMEMBER READING
ABOUT THAT.

09:33.100 --> 09:34.237
THEY SAY HE MADE OFF
WITH MILLIONS

09:34.270 --> 09:35.259
IN SPANISH GOLD COINS,

09:35.300 --> 09:37.666
BUT HIS BOAT SUNK OFF THE COAST
NORTH OF HERE.

09:37.710 --> 09:40.178
HE DISAPPEARED, AND YEARS LATER
HE SHOWED UP IN ARGENTINA.

09:40.210 --> 09:42.178
SUPERIOR RETENTION
OF HISTORIC DETAIL, GUS.

09:42.210 --> 09:47.079
BOUCHARD WAS ALSO FOND
OF HIDING CLUES

09:47.120 --> 09:48.917
TO THE TREASURE'S WHEREABOUTS
IN THE MAP.

09:48.950 --> 09:50.087
AND I STUMBLED UPON THIS ONE

09:50.120 --> 09:51.747
WHILE RESEARCHING HIM
IN ARGENTINA.

09:51.790 --> 09:53.155
(Henry)
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

09:53.190 --> 09:55.112
FIRST YOU SAY YOU'RE
IN MACHU PICCHU IN PERU,

09:55.160 --> 09:56.718
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
NOW YOU'RE IN ARGENTINA.

09:56.760 --> 09:58.751
SO WHICH ONE IS IT?

09:58.790 --> 10:00.223
DAD, HE'S NOT A SUSPECT.
[Henry Chuckles]

10:00.260 --> 10:02.057
HE'S SUSPECT,
ALL RIGHT.

10:02.100 --> 10:03.192
FORGET HIM.
FORGET HIM, OKAY?

10:03.230 --> 10:05.027
MY BIG BROTHER'S ALWAYS BEEN

10:05.070 --> 10:06.196
JUST A LITTLE CYNICAL.

10:06.230 --> 10:07.936
AND THAT'S WHAT I LOVE
ABOUT HIM.

10:07.970 --> 10:10.302
YOU STILL HAVEN'T ANSWERED
MY QUESTION.

10:12.040 --> 10:13.871
WHAT ABOUT IT, BOYS?

10:13.910 --> 10:16.037
WANT TO BE
TREASURE HUNTERS?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

10:16.080 --> 10:18.105
THAT'S LIKE ASKING ME
IF I WANT MY OWN JET PACK

10:18.150 --> 10:20.414
OR IF I'VE EVER WANTED
TO BE A KOALA BEAR.

10:20.450 --> 10:23.112
OKAY, I THINK HE MEANS,
YES, YOU CAN COUNT HIM IN.

10:23.150 --> 10:24.117
AND ME TOO.

10:24.150 --> 10:25.242
[laughs]

10:25.290 --> 10:27.178
SUPERB. MM.

10:27.220 --> 10:30.280
YOU KNOW,
I'VE BEEN, UH, READING A LOT

10:30.330 --> 10:32.059
ABOUT THAT DETECTIVE STUFF
YOU DO,

10:32.090 --> 10:33.421
AND IT SEEMS TO ME
THAT HAVING A PSYCHIC

10:33.460 --> 10:34.290
MIGHT BE A REAL ASSET.

10:34.330 --> 10:36.059
WHO KNEW I HAD ONE
IN MY OWN FAMILY?

10:36.100 --> 10:38.967
WELL, UNCLE JACK, I...

10:39.000 --> 10:40.433
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M NOT REALLY--

10:40.470 --> 10:42.700
I WOULDN'T NECESSARILY
SAY PSYCHIC.

10:42.740 --> 10:45.300
OH, HEY, HEY, HEY.
STOP THAT RIGHT NOW.

10:45.340 --> 10:46.364
DON'T YOU DO THAT
TO YOURSELF, YOUNG MAN.

10:46.410 --> 10:49.277
DO NOT SELL YOURSELF SHORT.

10:49.310 --> 10:50.174
DO NOT FEEL EMBARRASSED

10:50.210 --> 10:51.973
JUST 'CAUSE
YOU'RE A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

10:52.010 --> 10:53.910
DIDN'T I ALWAYS TELL YOU
YOU'D BE GREAT? DIDN'T I?

10:55.250 --> 10:56.410
YEAH, YOU DID.

10:56.450 --> 10:59.180
OKAY, NOW, HERE'S THE PLAN.

10:59.220 --> 11:01.154
EVERYTHING WE FIND,
WE SPLIT 50/50.

11:01.190 --> 11:04.785
THAT'S AFTER WE DONATE
MOST OF IT TO A MUSEUM, RIGHT?

11:04.830 --> 11:07.458
WE ARE SO
GONNA DO THAT, GUS.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.853
RIGHT.

11:08.900 --> 11:10.868
YOU AND I--
WE'RE REALLY, UP HERE,

11:10.900 --> 11:12.026
IN SYNCH.

11:12.070 --> 11:13.799
OKAY, SO THE FIRST THING
WE NEED TO DO IS...

11:13.840 --> 11:15.364
GET MATCHING FEDORAS?

11:15.400 --> 11:17.061
"GET MATCHING FEDORAS?"

11:17.110 --> 11:19.032
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO WANTED
THE FEDORAS, NOT ME.

11:19.070 --> 11:21.277
STOP CHANGING THE STORY.
MY MISTAKE.

11:21.310 --> 11:23.346
HE WANTED THE YELLOW GAUCHOS.
I SAID NO TO THAT.

11:23.380 --> 11:24.904
WOULD YOU PLEASE PUT ME IN A
SEPARATE ROOM FROM THESE IDIOTS?

11:24.950 --> 11:26.474
I WILL TELL YOU EVERYTHING.

11:26.510 --> 11:28.319
JUST CONTINUE.

11:28.350 --> 11:29.112
(Shawn)
JACK HAD TOLD US TO MEET HIM

11:29.150 --> 11:30.082
AT THE FRONT STEPS
OF THE MISSION,

11:30.120 --> 11:32.759
BECAUSE THAT WAS THE FIRST STEP
ON THE MAP.

11:32.790 --> 11:34.815
GUS AND I COULD BARELY CONTAIN
OUR EXCITEMENT.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.384
[thump]

11:36.420 --> 11:38.456
I CONTAINED MINE
A LITTLE BETTER.

11:41.760 --> 11:43.364
OKAY, JUST FOLLOW
MY LEAD.

11:43.400 --> 11:45.698
SAY YES
TO EVERYTHING.

11:49.870 --> 11:51.804
OH, WELCOME, WELCOME--
I'M KAREN RAVEN,

11:51.840 --> 11:53.273
HEAD OF THE SANTA BARBARA
HISTORICAL SOCIETY.

11:53.310 --> 11:55.232
WE ARE DELIGHTED TO HAVE

11:55.280 --> 11:57.840
SUCH A DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR
AS YOURSELF VISITING US.

11:57.880 --> 11:59.142
(Jack)
AH, GRACIAS, GRACIAS.

11:59.180 --> 12:00.477
[mumbling in faux Spanish]

12:00.520 --> 12:02.249
[Spanish accent]
I AM ABNER ESPINOZA,

12:02.280 --> 12:04.214
AND TH ESE
ARE MY COMPATRIOTS,

12:04.250 --> 12:08.516
ERNESTO AGAPITO
GARCES CON Y A DE ABELAR

12:08.560 --> 12:12.428
AND JUAN PRIESTLY.

12:12.460 --> 12:14.052
OH, NOW I SEE WHERE YOU GOT
THE PRIEST THING.

12:14.100 --> 12:15.089
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

12:15.130 --> 12:16.199
NOTHING.
NOTHING.

12:18.400 --> 12:19.219
WELL, WELCOME.

12:19.270 --> 12:21.761
PLEASE, COME THIS WAY.

12:25.170 --> 12:27.172
NOW, AS YOU KNOW,

12:27.210 --> 12:29.303
MOST OF OUR PRIZED
COLLECTION PIECES ARE KEPT

12:29.340 --> 12:30.443
AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC,
BUT, WELL,

12:30.480 --> 12:32.038
WE'RE HAPPY
TO OPEN OUR DOORS

12:32.080 --> 12:34.310
FOR VISITING DIGNITARIES
SUCH AS YOURSELVES.

12:34.350 --> 12:36.318
(both)
YES.

12:36.350 --> 12:37.886
OKAY, THEN.

12:37.920 --> 12:41.048
UM, TAKE AS MUCH TIME
AS YOU NEED.

12:41.090 --> 12:43.058
AND, UH, BILL HERE

12:43.090 --> 12:44.352
WILL BE WAITING
JUST OUTSIDE.

12:46.960 --> 12:48.359
ALL RIGHT, BOYS,
WE GOT ABOUT 10 MINUTES

12:48.400 --> 12:50.391
BEFORE THE REAL ESPINOZA
SHOWS UP.

12:50.430 --> 12:52.421
THERE'S A REAL ESPINOZA?

12:52.470 --> 12:55.837
WELL, TECHNICALLY SPEAKING,
WE USED TO BE PARTNERS.

12:55.870 --> 12:58.839
HE'S A GREAT GUY,
BUT WE HAD A LITTLE FALLING OUT

12:58.870 --> 13:00.303
WHEN I HAD A SMALL DALLIANCE
WITH HIS WIFE...

13:00.340 --> 13:03.275
AND HIS SISTER...
AND HIS HOUSEKEEPER DEBBIE.

13:03.310 --> 13:05.244
UNCLE JACK,
WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON HERE?

13:05.280 --> 13:10.308
MY RESEARCH HAS TOLD ME
THERE ARE CLUES

13:10.350 --> 13:13.285
ABOUT THE TREASURE'S WHEREABOUTS
HIDDEN SOMEWHERE IN THIS ROOM.

13:13.320 --> 13:16.448
AND IT ALL HAS TO DO
WITH THE NUMBER 152.

13:16.490 --> 13:18.481
WHY DON'T
WE JUST USE THE MAP?

13:20.430 --> 13:22.819
WELL, TECHNICALLY,
THERE'S, UH...

13:22.870 --> 13:24.121
SOMETHING
I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU

13:24.170 --> 13:26.525
ABOUT THE WHOLE MAP.

13:29.470 --> 13:32.200
UNCLE JACK, THIS IS A PRETTY
BIG THING TO LEAVE OUT.

13:32.240 --> 13:34.174
YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW.
IT'S A LONG STORY--

13:34.210 --> 13:37.509
A ONE-LEGGED WOMAN,
BOTTLE OF CUTTY SARK.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.973
THE POINT IS THAT
THE MISSING PART OF THE MAP

13:40.020 --> 13:42.477
IS THE FIRST STEP
OF THE HUNT.

13:42.520 --> 13:45.489
NOW, COME ON, KID,
USE THAT PSYCHIC GIFT YOU GOT.

13:45.520 --> 13:48.057
COME ON.

14:01.440 --> 14:02.532
OH, BOY.

14:02.570 --> 14:05.403
I-I-I'M SEEING LETTERS
SWARMING.

14:05.440 --> 14:06.930
TH EY'RE--
THEY'RE ZINGING.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.208
TH EY'RE--TH EY'RE--
THEY'RE FORMING--

14:08.240 --> 14:09.377
THEY'RE FORMING WORDS.

14:09.410 --> 14:10.502
THEY'RE FORMING WORDS--
"COULEUR."

14:10.550 --> 14:12.438
C-COULEUR.

14:12.480 --> 14:13.219
COULEUR.
COULEUR.

14:13.250 --> 14:14.547
WHAT IS THAT?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

14:14.580 --> 14:16.411
COULEUR.

14:16.450 --> 14:19.442
FRENCH, COLOR...

14:19.490 --> 14:20.457
PAINT!
PAINTING!

14:20.490 --> 14:23.129
THAT'S IT. COME ON, LET'S GO.
HURRY UP, MORE.

14:23.160 --> 14:25.253
THERE'S PAINTINGS
OVER THERE.

14:35.670 --> 14:38.935
WHOA, WHOA, WAIT.
GO BACK. GO BACK.

14:45.010 --> 14:46.238
HELLO, BOUCHARD.

14:46.280 --> 14:48.441
LET ME SEE THE MAP.

14:50.520 --> 14:53.114
WHERE DID YOU HIDE
THAT CLUE,

14:53.160 --> 14:55.412
YOU OLD SYPHILITIC SEA DOG?

15:05.230 --> 15:07.266
I KNOW
WHERE THE MAP STARTS.

15:10.510 --> 15:13.536
AND I KNOW
WHERE THE FIRST CLUE IS.

15:25.120 --> 15:27.054
WAIT. THE MAP
WAS ACTUALLY REAL?

15:27.090 --> 15:29.217
OH, YEAH.
WE COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

15:29.260 --> 15:30.557
THE LIGHTHOUSE
WAS THE FIRST CLUE.

15:30.590 --> 15:31.727
WHAT HAPPENED FROM THERE?

15:31.760 --> 15:33.227
WE DIDN'T MAKE IT
TO THE SECOND CLUE.

15:33.260 --> 15:34.557
WHY NOT?

15:34.600 --> 15:36.124
BECAUSE WE WEREN'T
THE ONLY ONES

15:36.160 --> 15:37.525
WHO FOUND THE LIGHTHOUSE.

15:42.300 --> 15:47.579
[gunshots]

15:47.610 --> 15:51.671
[whispering in Spanish]

15:51.710 --> 15:53.041
ALL RIGHT, SPENCER,
TELL THE CHIEF

15:53.080 --> 15:54.570
WHAT YOU JUST TOLD US.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.440
OKAY, CHIEF, HERE IT GOES.

15:56.480 --> 15:57.617
WE'RE SO HUNGRY.

15:57.650 --> 16:00.448
I CAN'T GET
THE BURRITO PLACE

16:00.490 --> 16:01.457
ON COTA STREET
OUT OF MY MIND.

16:01.490 --> 16:02.514
THEY'RE OPEN LATE.

16:02.560 --> 16:03.720
GUS, CHILDREN'S BURRITO,
NO SAUCE.

16:03.760 --> 16:05.682
DAD, I KNOW YOU'RE A FAN
OF THE CARNE ASADA.

16:05.730 --> 16:08.699
ALL RIGHT, MR. SPENCER,
LET ME BE FRANK.

16:08.730 --> 16:10.425
AS LONG AS I CAN BE DEAN
AND GUS CAN BE SAMMY.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.494
WHY DO I HAVE
TO BE SAMMY?

16:11.530 --> 16:12.497
FINE. HE'S SAMMY.

16:12.530 --> 16:13.792
THAT MAKES YOU JOEY BISHOP.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.728
IS THAT WHAT YOU REALLY WANT?
YOU WANT TO BE JOEY BISHOP?

16:15.770 --> 16:16.930
SHAWN.
I'M SORRY, JULES.

16:16.970 --> 16:19.063
HOW OFTEN DOES SOMEONE SET YOU
UP WITH "LET ME BE FRANK"?

16:19.110 --> 16:21.533
SHAWN!

16:21.580 --> 16:24.048
DON'T FORGET THAT YOU ARE
IN A LOT OF TROUBLE HERE.

16:24.080 --> 16:25.342
AND I AM PROBABLY
THE ONLY PERSON

16:25.380 --> 16:28.474
IN THIS ROOM WHO CARES
TO SEE YOU GET OUT OF IT.

16:28.520 --> 16:31.444
NOW, IT'S 2:30 IN THE MORNING.
WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR HOURS.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.117
ENOUGH WITH THE JOKES,
STOP DELAYING,

16:33.160 --> 16:34.559
AND TELL US
WHAT WE WANT TO HEAR!

16:38.660 --> 16:40.252
MY GOD.
THAT WAS SO HOT.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.291
SPENCER, TELL THE CHIEF
WHAT YOU TOLD US ABOUT THE GUYS

16:42.330 --> 16:44.389
WHO CHASED YOU AWAY FROM
THE LIGHTHOUSE WITH THE GUNS.

16:44.430 --> 16:47.092
(Gus)
NOT JUST CHASING US,
THEY FOUND US...

16:47.140 --> 16:48.459
HIDING IN A CABIN.

16:48.500 --> 16:49.467
WHO WERE THEY?

16:49.500 --> 16:51.468
(Henry)
JACK'S PARTNERS.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.375
'CAUSE THE ONE THING
THAT YOU COULD COUNT ON

16:53.410 --> 16:56.038
WITH MY BROTHER JACKIE,

16:56.080 --> 16:58.742
HE ALWAYS HAD PARTNERS.

17:00.720 --> 17:04.042
JACK, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

17:04.090 --> 17:05.489
MARK, CALM DOWN, WILL YA?

17:05.520 --> 17:07.385
IT'S ALL PART
OF THE PLAN.

17:07.420 --> 17:08.580
WAIT A SECOND.
YOU GUYS KNOW EACH OTHER?

17:08.620 --> 17:11.418
OH, YEAH.
WE WERE PARTNERS.

17:11.460 --> 17:12.722
I THOUGHT
WE WERE PARTNERS.

17:12.760 --> 17:14.694
OH, TECHNICALLY,
YOU'RE ALL MY PARTNERS.

17:14.730 --> 17:16.721
WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU
GUYS WENT TO PARTNER COLLEGE,

17:16.760 --> 17:17.692
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE

17:17.730 --> 17:18.719
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO SHOOT
AT YOUR PARTNERS.

17:18.770 --> 17:21.295
(Mark)
YEAH? SHOULD PARTNERS
DO THIS?

17:22.740 --> 17:24.708
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T USE
THE WORD "PARTNERS" ANYMORE.

17:24.740 --> 17:25.707
IT SEEMS
TO MAKE HIM MAD.

17:25.740 --> 17:28.129
MM. MM, MARK.

17:28.180 --> 17:29.238
[spits]

17:29.280 --> 17:31.703
KITTEN, LISTEN.

17:31.750 --> 17:34.241
THIS IS
MY NEPHEW SHAWN, OKAY?

17:34.280 --> 17:36.714
HE'S PSYCHIC,
FOR REAL.

17:36.750 --> 17:39.139
WORKS WITH THE COPS SOMETIMES,
FULLY LEGITIMATE--FULLY.

17:39.190 --> 17:40.714
I ONLY BROUGHT HIM AROUND
TO HELP WITH THE HUNT.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.648
AND I WAS JUST GONNA PAY HIM
A SMALL FINDER'S FEE, THAT'S IT.

17:42.690 --> 17:45.158
FINDER'S FEE?
IS THAT LIKE 50%?

17:45.190 --> 17:47.420
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

17:47.460 --> 17:48.791
NO. NOT BUYING IT.

17:48.830 --> 17:50.695
YOU WERE GONNA
SELL US OUT.

17:50.730 --> 17:53.164
WHOA! PSYCHIC THINGS
ARE HAPPENING TO ME!

17:53.200 --> 17:55.395
OH! RUNNING
DOWN MY LEGS.

17:55.440 --> 17:56.737
OH! OH!

17:56.770 --> 17:58.431
OH! OH!

17:58.470 --> 17:59.459
WELCOME, WELCOME.

17:59.510 --> 18:00.704
I'M KAREN RAVEN,

18:00.740 --> 18:03.800
HEAD OF THE SANTA BARBARA
HISTORICAL SOCIETY.

18:06.810 --> 18:07.640
YOU...

18:07.680 --> 18:09.614
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THE PREGNANCY.

18:09.650 --> 18:11.789
YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S
GONNA BE JUST FINE.

18:11.820 --> 18:13.253
[exhales sharply]

18:13.290 --> 18:15.656
HMM, HMM, HMM?
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

18:15.690 --> 18:17.226
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST LET US GO?

18:17.260 --> 18:18.659
WE'LL ALL
FIND THE TREASURE.

18:18.690 --> 18:21.124
WE'LL BE STINKING,
FILTHY RICH,

18:21.160 --> 18:22.422
AND LIVE FABULOUS LIVES.

18:22.460 --> 18:24.792
NO.
GIVE US THE MAP.

18:24.830 --> 18:26.661
WE DON'T HAVE THE MAP.

18:26.700 --> 18:27.667
REALLY?

18:27.700 --> 18:29.691
THAT'S TOO BAD.

18:29.740 --> 18:31.731
OKAY, IT'S
IN THE BACKPACK.

18:33.710 --> 18:35.302
THAN KS.

18:35.340 --> 18:37.604
[both whispering angrily]

18:41.580 --> 18:44.117
IT'S IN--IT'S IN
THE SIDE POUCH. SSH!

18:46.790 --> 18:48.280
HEY, GUS,

18:48.320 --> 18:51.778
SHOULD WE TELL MARK
THAT THERE'S A TEAR IN THE MAP?

18:55.800 --> 18:57.791
SON OF A BITCH, JACK!

18:57.830 --> 18:58.922
(Lassiter)
HOLD IT.

18:58.970 --> 19:01.234
SO YOU JUST GAVE THEM THE MAP
AND TOLD THEM EVERYTHING?

19:01.270 --> 19:03.636
NO, NOT EVERYTHING.

19:03.670 --> 19:04.807
OKAY, EVERYTHING.

19:04.840 --> 19:06.603
SO THE FOUND
THE TREASURE?

19:06.640 --> 19:08.779
NOT EXACTLY.

19:16.450 --> 19:20.386
(Shawn)
OKAY, I MAY HAVE
PSYCHICALLY LED THEM

19:20.420 --> 19:21.853
DOWN THE WRONG PATH.

19:21.890 --> 19:24.256
THE SPIRIT WORLD IS JUST ONE
OF LIFE'S LITTLE MYSTERIES,

19:24.290 --> 19:26.758
LIKE WHY THE OXYGEN NETWORK
AIRS GOODFELLAS,

19:26.790 --> 19:28.655
OR WHY FOOLS FALL IN LOVE.

19:28.700 --> 19:29.689
OW!

19:29.730 --> 19:30.765
OH, HERE YOU GO,
MR. GUSTER.

19:30.800 --> 19:33.394
THIS IS ALL THEY HAD
IN LOST-AND-FOUND IN YOUR SIZE.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.863
AN UGG BOOT?
I CAN'T WEAR AN UGG BOOT WITH--

19:36.940 --> 19:39.761
IT'LL BE DOPE
WITH MY ONE PUMA.

19:39.810 --> 19:40.799
NOW, MR. SPENCER.

19:40.840 --> 19:42.603
YES.
YES.

19:42.640 --> 19:43.868
OH, I MEANT THE OLDER--

19:43.910 --> 19:45.377
SORRY, NOT OLD,
LESS...

19:45.410 --> 19:47.617
HAN DSOME.
LESS HAIR?

19:47.650 --> 19:48.742
LESS FRIENDS
ON FACEBOOK?

19:48.780 --> 19:49.849
LESS NOSE.
OH!

19:49.880 --> 19:51.086
HENRY.

19:51.120 --> 19:53.714
DID YOU FILL OUT A BURGLARY
REPORT ON YOUR HOUSE YESTERDAY?

19:53.760 --> 19:56.354
I DID.
BUT NOTHING WAS TAKEN.

19:56.390 --> 19:58.620
OH. AND YET WHY DO I FEEL
THIS SOMEHOW PLAYS

19:58.660 --> 20:00.218
INTO THIS WHOLE MESS,
DOESN'T IT?

20:00.260 --> 20:02.751
I WAS THE ONE
WHO PICKED THEM UP.

20:02.800 --> 20:04.267
(Lassiter)
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

20:04.300 --> 20:06.291
HOW DID YOUR DAD KNOW
WHERE TO FIND YOU

20:06.330 --> 20:08.730
IF THAT MARK GUY TOOK
ALL YOUR CELL PHONES?

20:08.770 --> 20:10.965
THAT IS
A GOOD QUESTION.

20:13.510 --> 20:14.932
I HAVE TO PEE.

20:14.980 --> 20:16.675
NO. NO WAY, SHAWN.

20:16.710 --> 20:17.677
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

20:17.710 --> 20:18.699
HOLD IT LIKE A MAN.

20:18.750 --> 20:21.275
I'LL GET
A URINARY TRACT INFECTION.
LIKE A MAN.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.481
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU CAN LINK
YOUR LEGS UNDERNEATH YOUR CHAIRS

20:23.520 --> 20:25.488
AND FORM A WHEEL
AND ROLL TO THE BATHROOM.

20:25.520 --> 20:27.659
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO PROJECT
HOW THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

20:27.690 --> 20:29.248
I'M NOT ROLLING
ANYWHERE.

20:29.290 --> 20:30.951
I DON'T KNOW WHY I LISTEN
TO EITHER ONE OF YOU.

20:30.990 --> 20:32.321
NO ONE IS GONNA FIND US.

20:32.360 --> 20:33.850
WE'RE PROBABLY
GONNA DIE OUT HERE.

20:35.860 --> 20:36.792
GUS?
WHAT?

20:36.830 --> 20:39.560
WHAT IS THAT
ON YOUR LEG?

20:39.600 --> 20:40.532
NOTHING.

20:40.570 --> 20:43.903
DUDE, YOU ARE STRAPPED
WITH ANOTHER CELL PHONE?

20:43.940 --> 20:45.032
JUST CALL HENRY.
COME ON.

20:45.070 --> 20:46.401
NO, NO, WE'RE NOT
CALLING ANYONE.

20:46.440 --> 20:47.873
THAT IS MY WORK PHONE,
FOR WORK.

20:47.910 --> 20:49.377
THIS IS WORK.

20:49.410 --> 20:50.900
MY BOSS IS WATCHING
EVERYTHING I DO, SHAWN.

20:50.950 --> 20:52.042
PLUS, YOU ALREADY USED UP
HALF MY MINUTES

20:52.080 --> 20:53.775
WAITING ON HOLD
FOR CONCERT TICKETS.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.879
THAT WAS TONY! TONI! TONE! AND
WET WET WET PLAYING TOGETHER.

20:55.920 --> 20:58.741
YOU KNOW I CAN'T RESIST THAT.
THE SYMMETRY ALONE--

20:58.790 --> 21:01.759
ALL RIGHT, GUS,
THIS IS OUR ONLY CHOICE, MAN.

21:01.790 --> 21:03.929
[scoffs]
FINE.

21:03.960 --> 21:04.881
SHAWN, REACH DOWN
AND GET IT.

21:04.930 --> 21:07.398
ME? I'M NOT GONNA
REACH DOWN AND--YOU GET IT.

21:07.430 --> 21:08.556
WITH WHAT HAND?

21:08.600 --> 21:11.421
FINE.
I'LL DO IT.

21:11.470 --> 21:12.789
HOLD STILL.

21:12.830 --> 21:16.061
[both grunting]

21:16.100 --> 21:17.465
AH!

21:18.970 --> 21:19.902
STOP IT.

21:19.940 --> 21:21.077
YOU'RE WOBBLING!

21:21.110 --> 21:22.372
HOLD ON, NOW.

21:22.410 --> 21:24.947
AAH!
AAH!

21:26.650 --> 21:27.947
[grunts]

21:29.980 --> 21:31.447
HEY.
STOP FLEXING.

21:31.490 --> 21:32.616
OW!

21:32.650 --> 21:33.810
OH.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.349
[grunts]

21:37.390 --> 21:38.425
AH.

21:38.460 --> 21:40.087
[beeps, ringing]

21:40.130 --> 21:41.620
[muffled]

21:41.660 --> 21:43.867
WHA--
No, WAIT, IT'S RINGING.

21:43.900 --> 21:47.028
[man on phone]
FU'S PALACE.
WANT TO PLACE ORDER?

21:47.070 --> 21:48.992
YOU MUST HAVE DIALED
THE WRONG NUMBER.

21:49.040 --> 21:52.032
HI. WE'RE STUCK OUT IN A CABIN
ON TUNNEL ROAD.

21:52.070 --> 21:53.378
CAN YOU SEND HELP?

21:53.410 --> 21:54.729
FOR PICKUP OR DELIVERY?

21:54.780 --> 21:57.032
THIS IS JACK SPENCER,
AND I'M WILLING TO OFFER YOU

21:57.080 --> 21:59.548
A 50/ 50 SPLIT
ON PIRATE TREASURE.

21:59.580 --> 22:01.411
HANG UP, SHAWN.
HOLD ON.

22:01.450 --> 22:03.714
WHILE HE'S ON THE LINE,
YOU GUYS WANT ANYTHING?

22:03.750 --> 22:05.047
WILL YOU DIAL IT AGAIN?

22:05.090 --> 22:06.580
AND THIS TIME TRY TO DIAL
THE RIGHT NUMBER.

22:06.620 --> 22:07.518
LOOK, MAN, I'M DIALING

22:07.560 --> 22:09.710
WITH A 10-YEAR-OLD ERASERMATE
IN MY MOUTH.

22:09.760 --> 22:12.024
IT'S NOT
AN EXACT SCIENCE.

22:14.600 --> 22:16.056
[cell phone dialing]

22:16.100 --> 22:18.022
[ringing]

22:18.070 --> 22:20.026
[Henry on phone]
YOU'VE REACHED HENRY SPENCER.

22:20.070 --> 22:22.061
LEAVE YOUR NAME AND NUMBER.

22:22.100 --> 22:24.068
BUT SPEAK SLOWLY,
BECAUSE PEOPLE TALK

22:24.110 --> 22:27.568
TOO FAST ON THESE THINGS,
AND I CAN NEVER UNDERSTAND IT.

22:27.610 --> 22:29.077
HEY, DAD,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

22:29.110 --> 22:32.045
UH, I GOT GOOD NEWS--
GREAT NEWS--

22:32.080 --> 22:33.570
THE ELECTRIC WRENCH
YOU'VE BEEN WANTING

22:33.620 --> 22:35.770
IS IN STOCK
AT HOME DEPOT.

22:35.820 --> 22:37.742
UH, WHAT ELSE?

22:37.790 --> 22:39.587
THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE.
OH, I KNOW.

22:39.620 --> 22:42.111
IF YOU'RE NOT TOO BUSY,
GUS, JACK, AND I

22:42.160 --> 22:43.980
ARE TIED UP IN A CABIN

22:44.030 --> 22:45.952
ABOUT 100 YARDS OFF
TUNNEL ROAD,

22:45.990 --> 22:47.526
RIGHT BY WHERE WE HAD

22:47.560 --> 22:48.720
THE PULLED PORK SANDWICHES
THAT ONE TIME.

22:48.760 --> 22:49.954
SHAWN.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.059
(Lassiter)
SPENCER, ARE YOU GONNA ANSWER
MY QUESTION OR NOT?

22:52.100 --> 22:54.466
HOW DID YOUR DAD KNOW
WHERE TO FIND YOU?

22:54.500 --> 22:55.489
WITH SOME PEOPLE,

22:55.540 --> 22:57.508
I CAN COMMUNICATE
THROUGH PSYCHIC WAVELENGTHS.

22:57.540 --> 22:59.838
MY FATHER IS ONE OF THEM.
VAL KILMER IS ANOTHER.

22:59.870 --> 23:01.576
(Juliet)
HERE'S SOMETHING
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

23:01.610 --> 23:03.669
JACK'S PARTNER
WANTED THE MAP, RIGHT?

23:03.710 --> 23:06.008
SO WHY WOULD THEY TRASH
YOUR DAD'S HOUSE?

23:06.050 --> 23:08.109
THEY KNOW JACK WOULDN'T LET
THE MAP OUT OF HIS SIGHT.

23:08.150 --> 23:10.687
MARK AND HIS MEN,
THEY WEREN'T LOOKING FOR A MAP.

23:10.720 --> 23:13.553
SO WHAT WERE
THEY LOOKING FOR?

23:17.730 --> 23:20.699
YOU KNOW
YOU'RE MY BOY, SHAWN.

23:20.730 --> 23:23.995
WHY'D YOU HAVE TO GO
AND GIVE MARK THE MAP?

23:24.030 --> 23:25.861
BECAUSE I DON'T NEED IT.

23:25.900 --> 23:26.867
UNCLE JACK, TRUST ME.

23:26.900 --> 23:28.993
I CAN RE-CREATE THE MAP
PSYCHICALLY IN MY HEAD.

23:29.040 --> 23:30.701
HEY, HEY, HEY!

23:30.740 --> 23:32.537
SPARE ME, KID, OKAY?

23:32.570 --> 23:35.038
YOU CAN'T SNOW
THE SNOWMAN.

23:35.080 --> 23:38.072
WE WERE SO CLOSE.

23:45.150 --> 23:46.981
(man)
STOP!

23:49.860 --> 23:52.624
WHOA!
I FEEL JITTERY!

23:52.660 --> 23:54.127
IT STARTS WITH BEANS.

23:54.160 --> 23:56.651
GUS LIKES IT IN THE MORNING.
NOW HE HAS GAS.

23:56.700 --> 23:57.962
SOMETHING HAVING TO DO
WITH COFFEE?

23:58.000 --> 23:59.922
YES! COFFEE!

23:59.970 --> 24:02.894
COFFEE, COFFEE,
COFFEE, COFFEE TABLE!

24:02.940 --> 24:05.465
COFFEE TABLE.

24:05.510 --> 24:07.637
MARK AND HIS GOONS WEREN'T
LOOKING FOR THE MAP, WERE THEY?

24:07.680 --> 24:09.978
NO, NO. THEY WERE LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING ELSE.

24:10.010 --> 24:11.944
A DIFFERENT PIECE
OF THE PUZZLE.

24:11.980 --> 24:15.814
SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T WANT
CONNECTED TO THE MAP AT ALL.

24:15.850 --> 24:19.809
[gasps, exhales deeply]

24:19.850 --> 24:22.489
[chuckles]
THAT IS DOWNRIGHT SCARY!

24:22.520 --> 24:24.488
MAYBE YOU REALLY DO HAVE
A GIFT, KID.

24:24.530 --> 24:26.122
MY BAD
FOR DOUBTING IT.

24:26.160 --> 24:29.152
NOW, THIS KEY
IS ALSO FROM BOUCHARD'S STUFF

24:29.200 --> 24:30.667
I FOUND IN ARGENTINA.

24:30.700 --> 24:33.669
IT WAS USELESS
WITHOUT THAT MAP,

24:33.700 --> 24:36.134
BUT IF SHAWN CAN ACTUALLY
RE-CREATE THAT MAP,

24:36.170 --> 24:39.765
THAT PLUS THIS KEY
MEANS WE ARE BACK ON TRACK!

24:39.810 --> 24:41.004
OW!

24:41.040 --> 24:42.678
WHOA!

24:44.080 --> 24:47.049
GUYS, I GOT TO HIT
THE HEAD.

24:47.080 --> 24:51.210
BUT WHEN I COME BACK,
WE ARE FINDING US A TREASURE!

24:52.950 --> 24:53.917
[exhales deeply]

24:53.960 --> 24:55.587
HOPE HE BOUGHT THAT.

24:55.620 --> 24:56.609
WITH JACK,
YOU NEVER KNOW.

24:56.660 --> 24:58.924
YEAH. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
BUT IF THAT KEY IS REAL--

24:58.960 --> 25:00.188
(Henry)
SHAWN, COME ON,
TAKE A LOOK AROUND.

25:00.230 --> 25:02.050
HAVEN'T YOU HAD ENOUGH?

25:02.100 --> 25:04.125
THESE GUYS,
THEY DESTROYED MY LIVING ROOM.

25:04.170 --> 25:04.898
MARK AND HIS GOONS
AREN'T GONNA STOP.

25:04.930 --> 25:06.227
WE GOT TO GET
BACK OUT THERE, DAD.

25:06.270 --> 25:08.898
NO!
NO, SHAWN! NO!

25:08.940 --> 25:10.191
JUST COME WITH US.
COME WITH US.

25:10.240 --> 25:11.798
WHY DO YOU NEED ME?

25:11.840 --> 25:13.933
IT'S NOT THAT WE NEED YOU.
WE WANT YOU.

25:13.980 --> 25:15.902
PLUS, WE NEED YOU.

25:15.940 --> 25:17.134
WE NEED YOUR TRUCK

25:17.180 --> 25:18.807
BECAUSE MY CAR IS STILL
AT THE LIGHTHOUSE,

25:18.850 --> 25:20.044
AND MARK HAS THE KEY.

25:20.080 --> 25:21.172
THERE YOU GO.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

25:21.220 --> 25:23.541
SORRY.
COUNT ME OUT.

25:23.590 --> 25:25.114
SHOCKER.

25:28.660 --> 25:29.718
HEH, HEH, HEH.

25:29.760 --> 25:31.853
OKAY, GUYS, READY?
GOOD.

25:31.890 --> 25:32.788
ALL WE GOT TO DO NOW
IS BORROW A CAR.

25:32.830 --> 25:35.128
NOW, TECHNICALLY,
THE TERM IS HOT-WIRING.

25:35.160 --> 25:37.253
HOWEVER...
I'M IN, BUT I DRIVE.

25:37.300 --> 25:39.222
I'M THE ONE WHO DECIDES
IF AND WHEN

25:39.270 --> 25:40.259
WE GO TO THE POLICE.

25:40.300 --> 25:42.165
I DON'T WANT ANY MORE SURPRISES.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

25:42.200 --> 25:43.838
YES, DAD!

25:43.870 --> 25:45.861
BIG BRO, I KNEW
YOU'D COME AROUND.

25:45.910 --> 25:46.865
[chuckles]

25:46.910 --> 25:48.229
OKAY, PSYCHIC...

25:48.280 --> 25:50.578
WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP?

25:59.890 --> 26:02.211
[sniffing]

26:02.260 --> 26:05.184
[gasping]

26:05.230 --> 26:06.322
(Henry and Gus)
SHAWN!

26:08.930 --> 26:10.898
THE KEY
WILL GUIDE US NOW.

26:13.270 --> 26:14.339
[laughs]
I LOVE THIS.

26:14.370 --> 26:17.931
50/50 SPLIT
BETWEEN ME AND YOU GUYS!

26:19.410 --> 26:20.900
[engine turns over]

26:20.940 --> 26:23.079
(Henry)
NO MORE SURPRISES,
RIGHT, JACK?

26:23.110 --> 26:24.941
(Jack)
OF COURSE.

26:29.080 --> 26:43.222
YA LOS TENEMOS.

26:43.260 --> 26:44.295
TELL ME THIS, SHAWN--

26:44.330 --> 26:46.321
HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO FIND
CLUES FROM A BELL TOWER

26:46.370 --> 26:47.860
THAT HASN'T BEEN AROUND
FOR OVER 100 YEARS?

26:47.900 --> 26:49.333
THE PRESIDIO WAS HUGE--IT
WOULD'VE TAKEN UP

26:49.370 --> 26:50.337
SEVERAL BLOCKS.

26:50.370 --> 26:51.803
SO WHAT SHOULD WE DO NOW?

26:51.840 --> 26:53.899
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
WE CAN DO.

26:53.940 --> 26:55.339
GO BACK IN TIME.

27:17.300 --> 27:20.121
THE BELL TOWER
IS CALLING ME!

27:31.310 --> 27:33.676
SHAWN!
COME ON.

27:40.350 --> 27:42.318
SHAWN, WAIT UP!

27:42.360 --> 27:43.884
SHAWN!

27:45.360 --> 27:46.782
[bang]
OH!

27:52.400 --> 27:53.219
THIS IS IT.

27:53.270 --> 27:56.330
THIS IS WHERE
THE BELL TOWER STOOD.

27:56.370 --> 27:57.462
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

27:57.500 --> 27:59.365
LET'S BUY SOME MUFFLERS.

27:59.410 --> 28:01.207
HE DOESN'T EVEN OWN A CAR.

28:01.240 --> 28:03.777
I BET YOU I END UP
PAYING FOR THIS.

28:11.090 --> 28:12.216
YOU ALL RIGHT?

28:12.250 --> 28:14.059
YEAH.
YEAH, I'LL SURVIVE.

28:14.090 --> 28:15.387
WHAT ARE WE DOING
UP HERE, SHAWN?

28:15.420 --> 28:16.887
I'M NOT SURE YET.

28:16.920 --> 28:18.820
THAT'S PART OF THE FUN,
ISN'T IT?

28:18.860 --> 28:20.896
[clears throat]
WE ARE GOOD TO GO.

28:20.930 --> 28:23.228
THE MANAGER SAID WE CAN TAKE
AS MUCH TIME AS WE NEED.

28:23.260 --> 28:25.364
ALVIN, GOOD GUY.
FILIPINO.

28:25.400 --> 28:26.890
THEY LOVE ME.

28:26.930 --> 28:29.091
AND JACK OFFERED HIM
50% OF THE TREASURE.

28:29.140 --> 28:31.404
I ALSO GAVE HIM
AN '82 PENNY.

28:31.440 --> 28:33.431
IT WAS THE FIRST YEAR THEY USED
ZINC INSTEAD OF COPPER.

28:33.470 --> 28:35.802
OKAY, WHAT IS THE DEAL
WITH YOU AND ALL THESE PENNIES?

28:35.840 --> 28:37.478
(Juliet)
YEAH, I DON'T GET THAT EITHER.

28:37.510 --> 28:39.842
SO JACK COLLECT S THEM
AND THEN LEAVES THEM PLACES?

28:39.880 --> 28:41.814
WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?
JACK WAS ALWAYS
INTERESTED IN HISTORY.

28:41.850 --> 28:45.183
COLLECTING PENNIES WAS HIS WAY
OF BEING A PART OF IT.

28:45.220 --> 28:46.847
(Shawn)
BUT LEAVING THE PENNIES

28:46.890 --> 28:47.982
WAS HIS OWN
PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY.

28:48.020 --> 28:49.510
SEE, UNCLE JACK
ALWAYS SAID...

28:49.560 --> 28:51.448
I LEAVE THE PENNY
BECAUSE IT'S GOOD LUCK,

28:51.490 --> 28:54.891
AND LORD KNOWS THE WORLD
COULD USE MORE GOOD LUCK.

28:54.930 --> 28:56.522
ARE YOU FOR REAL?

28:56.560 --> 28:57.527
(Henry)
ALL RIGHT, SHAWN,
WHAT ARE WE DOING UP HERE?

28:57.560 --> 28:59.994
YOU THINK THAT WHEN BOUCHARD
CAPTURED THE FORT,

29:00.030 --> 29:01.190
HE STOOD UP HERE
ON THE BELL TOWER,

29:01.240 --> 29:02.491
GAZING OUT
INTO THE BIG BLUE OCEAN,

29:02.540 --> 29:04.462
LOOKING FOR A PLACE
TO HIDE THE TREASURE?

29:04.510 --> 29:07.229
(Shawn)
IF I WERE A FRENCH PIRATE

29:07.270 --> 29:09.431
WITH A BAD TEMPER AND AT LEAST
ONE VENEREAL DISEASE,

29:09.480 --> 29:11.368
WHERE WOULD I BE LOOKING?

29:11.410 --> 29:13.207
[sighs]

29:25.560 --> 29:26.481
THAT'S IT.

29:26.530 --> 29:28.293
THAT'S IT, RIGHT THERE.

29:28.330 --> 29:30.753
WE'RE SO CLOSE!
LET'S GO!

29:35.400 --> 29:36.537
HEY!

29:37.570 --> 29:39.037
HOW DID HE FIND US?

29:39.070 --> 29:40.503
HE'S GOT THE MAP.
HE MUST'VE FIGURED IT OUT.

29:40.540 --> 29:41.529
COME ON,
LET'S GO!

30:00.090 --> 30:01.421
[grunts]

30:01.460 --> 30:02.597
[squelchin
AAH! g]

30:02.630 --> 30:03.892
[grunting]

30:03.930 --> 30:05.397
SHAWN!

30:05.430 --> 30:06.795
SHAWN!

30:13.440 --> 30:15.431
I CAN'T LEAVE
MY PUMA, SHAWN.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.300
AAH'
(Shawn)
AAH!

30:24.450 --> 30:26.418
I GOT IT.

30:26.450 --> 30:29.817
THIS IS IT.
THIS IS THE BLUFF ON THE MAP.

30:38.030 --> 30:39.361
UNCLE JACK!

30:43.570 --> 30:46.038
I KNOW THIS PROBABLY ISN'T
THE RIGHT TIME TO SAY THIS,

30:46.070 --> 30:49.130
BUT, DUDE,
I THINK WE'RE GONNA GET

30:49.180 --> 30:57.474
TO RIDE IN A HELICOPTER.

30:57.520 --> 30:58.987
YOU'RE OBLIGATED
TO LET ME SPEAK WITH THEM.

30:59.020 --> 31:00.009
I'M NOT OBLIGATED
TO MAKE--.

31:00.050 --> 31:01.119
CHIEF, PERHAPS YOU SHOULD
SEE THIS ONE MORE TIME.

31:01.160 --> 31:03.219
NO, I DON'T NEED TO SEE
THE LETTER ONE MORE TIME.

31:03.260 --> 31:05.478
(Shawn)
JULES, LASSIE,
WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE?

31:05.530 --> 31:07.020
WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH THAT GUY?

31:07.060 --> 31:08.095
HE DIDN'T SAY A WORD TO US
WHEN HE BROUGHT US IN.

31:08.130 --> 31:10.223
HIS NAME
IS ANDRES CANDELARIA.

31:10.260 --> 31:11.420
HE WORKS
FOR THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT.

31:11.470 --> 31:12.960
APPARENTLY HE'S PART

31:13.000 --> 31:14.490
OF SOME INTERGOVERNMENTAL
TASK FORCE

31:14.540 --> 31:16.189
ON STOLEN ANTIQUITIES.

31:16.240 --> 31:17.559
[clears throat]

31:21.380 --> 31:22.130
HELLO, MR. SPENCER.

31:22.180 --> 31:24.148
I BELIEVE YOU KNOW
WHY YOU'RE HERE.

31:24.180 --> 31:25.670
AND I BELIEVE YOU KNOW
I KNOW WHY I'M HERE.

31:25.710 --> 31:28.213
NOW, WHY AM I HERE?

31:28.250 --> 31:29.114
TO HELP US FIND THE TREASURE

31:29.150 --> 31:30.640
THAT RIGHTLY BELONGS
TO MY GOVERNMENT.

31:30.680 --> 31:32.181
BUT WE DIDN'T FIND
ANYTHING.

31:32.220 --> 31:34.188
SI. AND MY MEN HAVE BEEN
SEARCHING THE BLUFFS

31:34.220 --> 31:35.653
ALL NIGHT AS WELL
WITH NO LUCK.

31:43.260 --> 31:46.969
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU STOPPED US
ONE STEP SHORT.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.888
YOUR TREASURE'S NOT
IN THE BLUFFS, CHE.

31:50.040 --> 31:51.462
AY-YI -YI !

31:51.510 --> 31:54.377
THE SPIRITS ARE GUIDING
MY MAN PAW!

31:54.410 --> 31:57.072
IT'S LIKE--IT'S LIKE
THAT MOVIE IDLE HANDS,

31:57.110 --> 31:58.179
EXCEPT WITH NO NUDITY,

31:58.210 --> 32:01.611
WHICH MEANS I MUST BE COMPLETELY
UNWATCHABLE RIGHT NOW.

32:01.650 --> 32:03.538
DO EITHER OF THESE WORDS
MEAN ANYTHING TO ANYONE?

32:03.580 --> 32:05.343
IT COULD BE THE CLUE
WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

32:05.390 --> 32:06.209
CUEVA IS SPANISH
FOR "CAVE."

32:06.250 --> 32:08.218
(Juliet)
COULEUR COULD BE FRENCH.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.216
I THINK IT MEANS "PAINT."

32:10.260 --> 32:12.251
I SPENT A SEMESTER IN PARIS,

32:12.290 --> 32:14.554
GOT SALMONELLA POISONING,
AND LOST 20 POUNDS.

32:14.600 --> 32:15.999
BEST NIGHT EVER.

32:16.030 --> 32:17.657
PAINTED CAVES--
THAT'S IT!

32:17.700 --> 32:18.667
BOUCHARD WAS FRENCH,

32:18.700 --> 32:20.691
BUT HE WAS FASCINATED
WITH THE CHUMASH INDIANS.

32:20.730 --> 32:23.392
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
CHUMASH INDIANS?

32:23.440 --> 32:24.634
WELL, THEY USED TO PAINT CAVES
ALL OVER THE AREA.

32:24.670 --> 32:27.366
WE USED TO ROUST PUNKS IN THERE
FROM DRINKING ALL THE TIME.

32:27.410 --> 32:29.332
"ROUST PUNKS"?

32:29.380 --> 32:30.529
THANK YOU,
JACK LORD.

32:30.580 --> 32:32.309
WE WILL NOW LEAD YOU
TO THE TREASURE.

32:32.350 --> 32:34.045
[marker thuds]
I KNOW THE CAVE.

32:34.080 --> 32:36.116
VERY WELL.
LET'S GO.

32:36.150 --> 32:38.118
STOP.
YOU ARE NOT DOING THIS.

32:38.150 --> 32:40.243
THE ONLY REASON I BROUGHT THESE
MEN HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE

32:40.290 --> 32:41.416
WAS BECAUSE SPENCER
WOULD NOT TALK WITH US

32:41.460 --> 32:42.609
UNLESS HE WAS
IN THE STATION.

32:42.660 --> 32:44.287
OKAY, LOOK, I SAID
WE WOULD COOPERATE WITH YOU,

32:44.330 --> 32:45.752
BUT THEY ARE EMPLOYEES
OF THE SBPD,

32:45.790 --> 32:47.382
AND THEY'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE
WITHOUT MY DETECT IVES.

32:47.430 --> 32:49.728
CHIEF, WE HAVE BEEN
THROUGH THIS, NO?

32:49.760 --> 32:51.398
THIS IS FROM YOUR
TREASURY DEPARTMENT,

32:51.430 --> 32:52.761
GIVING ME FULL POWER
TO CALL THE SHOTS.

32:52.800 --> 32:54.165
NOW, I THANK YOU
FOR YOUR HELP,

32:54.200 --> 32:56.430
BUT IT WILL NO LONGER
BE NEEDED.

32:56.470 --> 32:58.165
VAMOS.

33:02.310 --> 33:04.073
[sighs]

33:04.110 --> 33:05.338
SORRY.

33:13.190 --> 33:15.181
[grunting]

33:20.390 --> 33:22.620
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE ACTUALLY
DIGGING FOR BURIED TREASURE.

33:22.660 --> 33:24.366
I KNOW, DUDE--AND YOU'RE GETTING
YOUR PANTS TOTALLY DIRTY,

33:24.400 --> 33:25.526
AND YOU DON'T EVEN CARE.

33:25.570 --> 33:27.322
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

33:27.370 --> 33:28.359
KEEP DIGGING!

33:28.400 --> 33:30.368
[thud]

33:42.420 --> 33:43.318
H.B.

33:43.350 --> 33:45.238
THAT COULD BE
FOR HIPPOLYTE DE BOUCHARD.

33:45.290 --> 33:47.246
OR HARRY BELAFONTE.

33:47.290 --> 33:49.053
NO.
NO, THAT DOES--
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

33:49.090 --> 33:51.354
JUST GET IT OUT!

33:51.390 --> 33:53.085
[both grunting]

33:53.130 --> 33:54.427
[exhales sharply]

33:56.600 --> 33:58.090
[grunts]

33:59.230 --> 34:00.527
(Gus)
OH, MY GOD.

34:00.570 --> 34:02.834
IT'S REAL.

34:02.870 --> 34:04.360
SI.

34:04.410 --> 34:06.708
[coins jingling]

34:06.740 --> 34:08.276
WELL DONE.

34:08.310 --> 34:10.073
BUEN TRABAJO.

34:10.110 --> 34:12.408
YOU SHOULD KNOW
THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT OWES YOU

34:12.450 --> 34:13.747
A GREAT DEBT
OF GRATITUDE.

34:13.780 --> 34:15.213
NOW...

34:15.250 --> 34:16.512
COULD I PLEASE HAVE
THE COINS?

34:19.350 --> 34:22.080
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
BEFORE WE DO THAT...

34:22.120 --> 34:23.451
I SHOULD TELL YOU,

34:23.490 --> 34:26.379
I KNOW THREE THINGS
THAT YOU PROBABLY DON'T KNOW.

34:26.430 --> 34:28.159
UNO...

34:28.200 --> 34:31.192
THE SECRET OF NIMH
AND THE SECRET OF MY SUCCESS...

34:31.230 --> 34:32.299
SAME SECRET.

34:32.330 --> 34:33.399
DOS...

34:33.430 --> 34:34.533
I KNOW THAT YOU

34:34.570 --> 34:36.561
DON'T WORK
FOR THE SPANISH GOVERNMENT.

34:36.600 --> 34:38.704
[laughs]
AND TRES...

34:38.740 --> 34:41.208
TH ESE CAVES ARE ACTUALLY
QUITE SLIPPERY.

34:44.480 --> 34:45.208
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

34:45.250 --> 34:47.571
GRAB THAT, GRAB THAT!
RIGHT THERE!

34:50.850 --> 34:51.839
[shouts in Spanish]

34:51.890 --> 34:53.243
[grunts]

34:58.430 --> 34:59.727
[grunting]

35:01.560 --> 35:03.699
WHAT IS GOING ON?
WHY ARE WE RUNNING?

35:03.730 --> 35:05.766
WHY DID WE LEAVE
THE CAVES?

35:13.570 --> 35:15.276
HEY!

35:19.280 --> 35:20.577
UGH!

35:28.360 --> 35:30.817
SHAWN! SHAWN!

35:30.860 --> 35:32.487
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR OTHER PUMA?

35:32.530 --> 35:34.498
YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!
I LOST ANOTHER SHOE?

35:34.530 --> 35:35.656
COME ON.

35:38.530 --> 35:39.519
THIS WAY!

35:42.800 --> 35:44.631
VAMONOS!

35:56.520 --> 35:57.873
JACK!
JACK!

35:57.920 --> 35:59.808
YES!

35:59.850 --> 36:01.659
HEY, GUYS.
I TOLD YOU I'D COME BACK.

36:01.690 --> 36:03.351
I'VE BEEN TRACKING YOU
THE WHOLE TIME.

36:03.390 --> 36:04.755
DO YOU, UH--DO YOU HAVE
THE TREASURE?

36:04.790 --> 36:05.859
THIS IS IT.

36:05.890 --> 36:07.653
AAH! HA!

36:07.690 --> 36:08.918
I ALWAYS BELIEVED IN YOU, KID!

36:08.960 --> 36:10.791
I ALWAYS KNEW
YOU WERE SPECIAL!

36:10.830 --> 36:12.388
[shouting in distance]

36:12.430 --> 36:13.829
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU CAN'T COME IN HERE.

36:13.870 --> 36:15.497
WE GOTTA SPLIT UP
FOR SAFETY.

36:15.540 --> 36:16.666
NOW, LISTEN,

36:16.700 --> 36:18.509
THEY'RE NOT GONNA HURT YOU
IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE GOLD.

36:18.540 --> 36:20.531
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
WHAT?

36:20.570 --> 36:22.276
COME ON, LET'S HAVE IT.

36:25.680 --> 36:27.341
REMEMBER THE PLACE ON FOOTHILL
WHERE I USED TO TAKE YOU

36:27.380 --> 36:28.745
WHEN YOU WERE A KID,
GET YOU BURGERS AND SHAKES?

36:28.780 --> 36:30.213
YEAH, IT'S RED ROBIN.
IT'S STILL THERE.

36:30.250 --> 36:32.548
THAT'S THE ONE.
I'LL MEET YOU THERE IN AN HOUR.

36:32.590 --> 36:33.887
[starts car]

36:33.920 --> 36:35.456
I'LL BE THERE.

36:39.630 --> 36:41.928
YEE-HA!

36:45.970 --> 36:47.597
(Mark)
DAMN IT! YOU GAVE HIM THE GOLD,
DIDN'T YOU?

36:47.630 --> 36:49.598
HEY, THAT'S MY GOLD!

36:49.640 --> 36:50.891
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

36:50.940 --> 36:51.929
IF THERE WERE DOVES
FLYING AROUND,

36:51.970 --> 36:53.301
WE'D BE
IN A JOHN WOO MOVIE.

36:53.340 --> 36:54.602
(Mark)
SON OF A BITCH!

36:54.640 --> 36:55.709
I'M GOING
TO KILL JACK!

36:55.740 --> 36:57.002
WHAT?
YOU KNOW JACK?

36:57.040 --> 36:58.007
HE WAS MY PARTNER.

36:58.040 --> 36:59.473
HE WAS MY PARTNER.

36:59.510 --> 37:01.649
UH, TECHNICALLY,
IRON GIANT GUY,

37:01.680 --> 37:02.669
HE WAS ALL
OF OUR PARTNERS.

37:02.720 --> 37:05.609
AND THE GUY WHO ANSWERS
THE PHONE AT FU'S PALACE.

37:05.650 --> 37:06.787
(Gus)
AND THE GUY
AT THE MUFFLER SHOP.

37:06.820 --> 37:07.912
GOOD CATCH, GUS.

37:07.950 --> 37:09.588
LOOK, FELLAS, WE'RE JUST
GONNA ROLL ON OUT

37:09.620 --> 37:11.019
IF THAT'S COOL,
LET YOU SETTLE

37:11.060 --> 37:12.357
YOUR BUSINESS HERE.

37:12.390 --> 37:13.618
NOT SO FAST.

37:13.660 --> 37:14.729
WHY DON'T WE JUST TAKE
THE NEPHEW HERE

37:14.760 --> 37:17.490
AND RANSOM HIS ASS
FOR THE GOLD?

37:17.530 --> 37:18.519
WE HAVE
NO OTHER CHOICE.

37:18.570 --> 37:21.334
NO, NO, NO, NO. NO.
YOU--YOU ALWAYS HAVE A CHOICE.

37:21.370 --> 37:22.735
YOU COULD RANSOM
GUS'S ASS.

37:22.770 --> 37:23.691
YOU COULD SWIRL IT UP.

37:23.740 --> 37:26.709
YOU COULD RANSOM HALF MY ASS
AND HALF HIS ASS.

37:29.340 --> 37:30.876
[sirens blaring]

37:34.920 --> 37:36.012
DROP IT!

37:36.050 --> 37:37.369
HANDS IN THE AIR!

37:40.690 --> 37:43.557
[chatter over police radio]

37:50.800 --> 37:52.495
SHAWN, YOU KNOW
I DON'T CURSE VERY OFTEN.

37:52.530 --> 37:54.066
SO WHEN I DO,
YOU KNOW I MEAN IT.

37:54.100 --> 37:55.067
WHAT THE HELL
JUST HAPPENED?

37:55.100 --> 37:58.069
I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T A BIG FAN
OF THE WRAP-UP.

37:58.100 --> 38:00.432
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU.

38:00.470 --> 38:01.300
SO, BACK AT THE STATION,

38:01.340 --> 38:03.479
I REALIZE ANDRES' ACCENT
ISN'T SPANISH.

38:03.510 --> 38:04.977
IT'S ARGENTINEAN.

38:05.010 --> 38:06.807
AND THAT'S WHERE UNCLE JACK
JUST GOT BACK FROM,

38:06.850 --> 38:08.772
SO I FIGURE HE'S ONE
OF JACK'S PARTNERS.

38:08.820 --> 38:10.549
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

38:10.580 --> 38:12.616
YOU WORKED AT THAT WINERY
IN ARGENTINA FOR A YEAR.

38:12.650 --> 38:13.639
I KEPT THE POSTCARDS.

38:13.690 --> 38:14.714
YOU DID?

38:14.760 --> 38:16.648
I USE 'EM
AS BEER COASTERS.

38:16.690 --> 38:18.658
OKAY, SHAWN, WH--

38:18.690 --> 38:20.829
SO THAT'S WHY
I CALLED ANDRES CHE,

38:20.860 --> 38:22.122
TO SEE IF HE'D REACT,
WHICH HE DID,

38:22.160 --> 38:25.561
BECAUSE IN ARGENTINA, CHE
IS SLANG FOR "BUDDY" OR "PAL,"

38:25.600 --> 38:27.420
SORT OF LIKE I CALL YOU
"BLACK STAR"

38:27.470 --> 38:28.630
OR "HOME SKILLET"
OR "BIG BABY BURTON."

38:28.670 --> 38:30.797
DON'T EVER CALL ME

38:30.840 --> 38:32.398
BUT WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ANYBODY?

38:32.440 --> 38:33.202

39:14.980 --> 39:16.049

BUT IT'S GOOD.

39:47.680 --> 39:48.442

39:48.480 --> 39:50.778
THAT IS THE BEST SHAKE
ON THE PLANET.

39:50.820 --> 39:53.687
ONE PART ICE CREAM,
TWO PARTS AWESOME.

39:53.720 --> 39:56.712
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME
SINCE YOU CALLED ME FOR A RIDE.

39:58.160 --> 39:59.479
YEAH, WELL,
GUS GOT TIRED

39:59.530 --> 40:00.952

HE'LL ALWAYS COME BACK.

40:05.570 --> 40:06.662
YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST
TO GET DUPED.

40:06.700 --> 40:08.122

WON'T BE THE LAST.

40:08.170 --> 40:09.637
WELCOME TO THE CLUB, KID.

40:09.670 --> 40:12.639

OWE YOU AN APOLOGY.

40:12.670 --> 40:14.137
I CAN SEE NOW
WHERE UNCLE JACK

40:14.170 --> 40:15.933
MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN
THE BEST ROLE MODEL.

40:15.980 --> 40:18.744
YEAH, MAYBE NOT.

40:18.780 --> 40:20.202
WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY ANYTHING
WHEN I WAS A KID?

40:20.250 --> 40:21.774
BECAUSE I ALWAYS
WANTED YOU

40:21.820 --> 40:24.846
TO HAVE THE--THE FUN UNCLE
IN YOUR LIFE.

40:24.890 --> 40:26.744
I WAS ONLY HARD ON YOU
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT

40:26.790 --> 40:27.745
YOUR LIFE
TO TURN OUT

40:27.790 --> 40:29.155
LIKE THE FUN UNCLE.

40:29.190 --> 40:32.057
WELL, IT DIDN'T...

40:32.090 --> 40:33.557
NOT TOTALLY.

40:35.760 --> 40:37.227
HERE YOU GO.

40:37.260 --> 40:38.796

40:41.770 --> 40:43.237

THE PENNY THING?

40:43.270 --> 40:44.908
YOUR GRANDPA
TAUGHT ME THAT,

40:44.940 --> 40:46.168
AND THEN I TAUGHT IT TO JACK

40:46.210 --> 40:48.235
WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

40:48.270 --> 40:50.500
HE JUST TOOK IT
TO ANOTHER WHOLE LEVEL.

40:50.540 --> 40:53.247
YEAH, HE, UH,
HE SEEMS TO DO THAT A LOT.

40:53.280 --> 40:54.611
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE

40:54.650 --> 40:55.912
THAT HE GOT AWAY
WITH THE GOLD.

40:55.950 --> 40:57.918
I--YOU GOT TO THINK
THAT SOMEDAY

40:57.950 --> 41:00.214
ALL THIS STUFF IS GONNA
CATCH UP WITH HIM, HUH?

41:00.250 --> 41:02.616
YEAH.

41:02.660 --> 41:04.753
AND THAT DAY
MIGHT JUST BE TODAY.

ABOUT THIS?

41:13.130 --> 41:14.734

41:22.580 --> 41:25.003
I KNEW HE WAS GONNA SHOW UP
IN THE CAR.

41:25.050 --> 41:27.507
I MADE THE SWITCH WHEN WE WERE
RUNNING THROUGH THE FOREST.

41:29.050 --> 41:31.109
SO WHAT DOES JACK HAVE?

41:36.220 --> 41:39.724
