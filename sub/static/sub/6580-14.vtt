00:15.840 --> 00:18.013
How long have you been awake?

00:18.796 --> 00:20.277
Ethan?

00:20.279 --> 00:21.889
Since 1:00.

00:22.764 --> 00:25.231
Well, I didn't leave a
toothbrush and eyeliner

00:25.256 --> 00:26.234
in your medicine cabinet

00:26.259 --> 00:28.860
so I could sleep in
your bed without you.

00:30.793 --> 00:33.101
I've been in therapy.

00:35.049 --> 00:39.036
Not just Dr. Charles, but the
group he sent me to at the V.A.

00:39.804 --> 00:41.321
Thought I'd be further along.

00:41.346 --> 00:43.693
Thought I'd at least be sleeping.

00:45.971 --> 00:48.323
Beginning to think it's a waste of time.

00:48.743 --> 00:50.972
Ethan, you know...

00:51.325 --> 00:55.994
PTSD... there's no quick
fix. It's a process.

01:04.522 --> 01:06.289
Come back to bed.

01:15.469 --> 01:17.651
Gotta go for a run.

01:23.712 --> 01:25.145
[sighs]

01:25.170 --> 01:28.193
This is not my first rodeo.
I-I've been through this before.

01:28.218 --> 01:31.209
You sit there deciding who
gets to see the doctor next.

01:31.234 --> 01:34.014
And the answer is me. I'm next.

01:34.039 --> 01:36.342
Mr. Coleman, there are
people in front of you.

01:36.367 --> 01:39.356
My heart is beating inside my head.

01:39.381 --> 01:41.887
Find a magazine and
please wait your turn.

01:41.912 --> 01:43.312
We've been through this.

01:43.337 --> 01:45.054
Tell me something.

01:45.079 --> 01:48.313
Leah, where's your heart?

01:48.420 --> 01:51.738
In your chest, right
there, behind your bra?

01:51.880 --> 01:55.404
- You step back now.
- Not mine.

01:55.429 --> 01:56.857
No, mine's floated up my neck

01:56.882 --> 01:58.475
and it's beating inside my skull.

01:58.500 --> 01:59.889
It's just... it's
beating inside my skull

01:59.914 --> 02:00.898
and it's driving me crazy.

02:00.923 --> 02:02.344
Please, man!

02:02.602 --> 02:03.657
- Hey!
- I need to see a doctor!

02:03.682 --> 02:05.375
- Hey, sir!
- Excuse me!

02:05.400 --> 02:06.861
- Security!
- Sir...

02:06.886 --> 02:09.101
April, get security. Sir...

02:09.126 --> 02:10.461
I need a doctor!

02:10.487 --> 02:12.254
[panting]

02:12.279 --> 02:13.745
Can someone please help me?

02:13.770 --> 02:14.835
[grunts]

02:14.860 --> 02:17.131
- Dr. Choi!
- Whoa, whoa.

02:17.156 --> 02:19.833
Sir, look at me. Wait, wait, wait.

02:20.042 --> 02:22.309
We need to get you back
into the waiting room.

02:22.334 --> 02:23.468
I could have lied;

02:23.493 --> 02:24.633
I could have said that
I had chest pains.

02:24.658 --> 02:26.068
You would have had to see
me then, but I'm not a liar.

02:26.093 --> 02:27.369
Okay, okay.

02:27.394 --> 02:29.007
Sir, why don't you just come with me?

02:29.328 --> 02:30.795
Come with me.

02:30.820 --> 02:33.140
- It's okay.
- Someone's gotta make it stop.

02:33.165 --> 02:34.650
- Okay.
- It's gotta stop.

02:34.675 --> 02:36.408
We will get to you as soon as we can.

02:36.433 --> 02:37.671
No!

02:37.696 --> 02:39.952
[shouting]

02:39.977 --> 02:43.328
[screaming]

02:44.314 --> 02:46.274
Will somebody see me now?

02:46.299 --> 02:48.247
[sobbing]

02:48.272 --> 02:49.505
Page Dr. Charles.

02:49.530 --> 02:51.647
Got you.

02:56.414 --> 03:00.614
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

03:01.399 --> 03:03.333
I'm not crazy! I'm not!

03:03.358 --> 03:05.889
Mr. Colman, I'm Dr. Choi.
We need you to stay calm.

03:05.914 --> 03:08.436
Didn't help... It's...
it's still pounding!

03:08.461 --> 03:10.717
He says his heart is
pounding inside of his head.

03:10.742 --> 03:12.594
Mr. Coleman, I need to examine your ear.

03:12.619 --> 03:14.524
I don't care about the ear! [screaming]

03:14.549 --> 03:15.922
Let's get him something for the pain.

03:15.947 --> 03:18.000
- 5 of morphine IV, please.
- Got it.

03:18.225 --> 03:21.725
Mr. Coleman, I'm Dr.
Charles, psychiatrist.

03:21.750 --> 03:23.193
Just because I'm a vet

03:23.218 --> 03:25.225
does not mean that I am a mental case.

03:25.250 --> 03:27.123
You did walk in here and
stab yourself in the head.

03:27.148 --> 03:29.500
Because no one...  No one would help me.

03:29.525 --> 03:31.694
Well, look, I-I just need
to do a little evaluation,

03:31.719 --> 03:33.421
ask you a couple questions;
that be all right?

03:33.446 --> 03:36.915
I'm not crazy. I'm not a drug addict.

03:36.940 --> 03:38.764
You're wearing six shirts?

03:38.789 --> 03:40.982
Yeah, but just one pair of pants.

03:41.007 --> 03:43.048
Why's that? Isn't it obvious?

03:43.073 --> 03:45.607
To... to muffle the sound of my heart.

03:45.632 --> 03:47.172
Does it help?

03:47.197 --> 03:49.440
Nothing... nothing helps!

03:49.465 --> 03:52.425
[panting] Please... somebody...

03:52.584 --> 03:54.484
[panting]

03:59.085 --> 04:01.397
Good morning. I'm Dr. Manning.

04:01.422 --> 04:03.945
- I bet you're Bo.
- And I'm Griffin.

04:04.080 --> 04:05.746
Well, hello, Griffin. Nice to meet you.

04:05.771 --> 04:07.304
Did you see that man?

04:07.329 --> 04:08.882
He stuck a pencil in his ear.

04:08.907 --> 04:11.156
Yes, it was very bad, wasn't it?

04:11.181 --> 04:13.292
- Yeah.
- Sorry you had to see that.

04:13.538 --> 04:15.545
The boys were playing in the driveway

04:15.570 --> 04:17.184
waiting for the school bus.

04:17.208 --> 04:19.414
I see you fell off your hoverboard.

04:19.500 --> 04:21.168
I see a lot of hoverboarders in here,

04:21.192 --> 04:22.926
if that's even a word.

04:22.944 --> 04:25.031
Yeah, he hit a patch of gravel.

04:25.056 --> 04:26.522
I tried to keep it cold.

04:26.547 --> 04:28.213
Let me know if this hurts.

04:28.238 --> 04:30.396
[groaning]

04:30.421 --> 04:33.171
I see there's no abrasions on the palm.

04:33.196 --> 04:36.364
It... it feels like it's sleeping.

04:36.391 --> 04:38.060
Hmm.

04:38.937 --> 04:40.603
You know what I think?

04:40.628 --> 04:43.269
I think this is a very broken wrist.

04:43.345 --> 04:44.711
I do too.

04:44.987 --> 04:46.420
It made a bad noise.

04:46.445 --> 04:48.476
Griffin, honey, please.

04:48.501 --> 04:50.568
Did you hurt your hand
as well, Mrs. Taylor?

04:50.593 --> 04:52.585
No, no, no. Kitchen accident.

04:52.610 --> 04:54.610
Burnt myself. It's fine.

04:56.190 --> 04:58.457
Well, I'd like to get
an X-Ray of Bo's wrist.

04:58.714 --> 05:00.647
You know what, I'd prefer you didn't.

05:00.672 --> 05:03.023
I don't want to expose him
to unnecessary radiation.

05:03.048 --> 05:06.483
It's just a minute radiation
exposure and it is necessary.

05:06.508 --> 05:09.066
A surgeon needs to go in there
and reposition the bones.

05:09.091 --> 05:10.858
But if they're already operating,

05:10.883 --> 05:12.421
why do you need a X-Ray?

05:12.446 --> 05:15.171
An X-Ray will tell the surgeon
exactly what needs to be done.

05:15.196 --> 05:17.063
But I do need your permission.

05:17.088 --> 05:20.765
[sighs] Okay, it's fine.

05:22.849 --> 05:25.917
All right, well, someone will
be in to take you up to X-Ray.

05:25.942 --> 05:27.375
Thanks.

05:28.966 --> 05:31.333
[groaning and stammering]

05:31.358 --> 05:33.714
- Fresh balloons every day.
- Yeah, I know.

05:33.739 --> 05:36.039
His room is starting to
look like a party store.

05:36.064 --> 05:37.086
[chuckles]

05:37.111 --> 05:39.643
I appreciate you checking
in on him the way you do.

05:39.668 --> 05:41.783
Oh, please. Eric's my guy.

05:41.808 --> 05:43.334
Tell him I'll be up during my break.

05:43.359 --> 05:44.835
All right.

05:44.860 --> 05:47.196
Your ride's here.

05:47.633 --> 05:51.523
Hold that, hold it please. Thank you.

05:53.488 --> 05:55.903
[laughs]

05:56.281 --> 05:58.694
Honey, the only thing that's worse

05:58.719 --> 06:01.341
than dating a patient
is dating an athlete.

06:01.399 --> 06:03.165
Well, his son is the patient,

06:03.190 --> 06:05.182
and he's retired.

06:05.446 --> 06:08.404
Don't get me wrong. I love athletes.

06:08.429 --> 06:11.875
But in my experience, they're
little kids in men's bodies.

06:11.900 --> 06:13.934
Bad long-term bets.

06:17.838 --> 06:21.858
Ventricular septal defect repair.

06:21.883 --> 06:23.958
Lots of people born with
holes in their hearts.

06:24.385 --> 06:26.553
Procedure's a mainstay
in the CT repertoire.

06:26.578 --> 06:28.320
Good one to get under your
belt. You mind my talking?

06:28.345 --> 06:29.250
No.

06:29.275 --> 06:31.603
Straightforward, high success rate.

06:31.750 --> 06:33.765
Mostly kids, sometimes a newborn,

06:33.790 --> 06:38.103
in which case, stay focused on
the simplicity of the procedure.

06:38.795 --> 06:41.763
Try not to be distracted by the fact

06:41.788 --> 06:43.691
that an infant's heart

06:43.989 --> 06:47.665
is smaller than a strawberry.

06:48.027 --> 06:49.794
Can take you out of the moment.

06:49.835 --> 06:51.474
Right.

06:52.203 --> 06:54.617
So far so good.

07:09.087 --> 07:10.819
You punctured the tympanic membrane

07:10.844 --> 07:12.528
and went into the middle ear.

07:12.553 --> 07:15.068
We can do the repair. It's
called a tympanoplasty.

07:15.093 --> 07:17.471
Just listen to my heart.

07:26.537 --> 07:28.654
It's loud, right?

07:31.131 --> 07:32.662
Sounds normal to me.

07:32.687 --> 07:33.791
[scoffs]

07:33.934 --> 07:35.215
That can't be!

07:35.240 --> 07:37.307
You know, Mr. Coleman,

07:37.404 --> 07:39.295
I'm a vet too.

07:39.716 --> 07:41.883
I know something about PTSD.

07:41.908 --> 07:44.280
It's not that.

07:45.164 --> 07:48.671
I-I saw combat, but I-I was okay.

07:48.696 --> 07:50.914
What happened?

07:52.360 --> 07:54.514
My convoy hit an IED.

07:54.539 --> 07:57.950
I took a back full of
shrapnel. That was it.

07:57.975 --> 07:59.898
Mind if I take a look?

08:10.538 --> 08:12.483
Looks like it was serious. I'm sorry.

08:12.508 --> 08:14.616
I was out of the hospital
in a couple weeks.

08:14.641 --> 08:16.400
That was three years ago.

08:16.425 --> 08:17.967
I was doing fine.

08:17.992 --> 08:19.482
This thing with my head and my heart,

08:19.507 --> 08:20.984
that started just six months ago.

08:21.009 --> 08:22.693
I wish I could tell you

08:22.718 --> 08:25.047
there's a physical
reason for the problem.

08:25.072 --> 08:27.283
[groaning]

08:28.669 --> 08:31.060
I can't see one.

08:34.273 --> 08:36.124
Morning.

08:37.412 --> 08:38.878
Hey.

08:38.903 --> 08:41.339
I heard Mr. Baker dropped the lawsuit.

08:41.706 --> 08:44.028
Yeah.

08:44.726 --> 08:47.225
That must be a relief.

08:47.547 --> 08:51.868
Not exactly the happy ending, but yeah.

09:02.774 --> 09:05.208
Reese, are you chewing gum?

09:05.233 --> 09:06.515
Oh, it's sugarless.

09:06.540 --> 09:08.444
Well, that's not the
point. It's unprofessional.

09:08.469 --> 09:10.703
Spit it out before you
go see another patient.

09:16.979 --> 09:18.679
Dr. Reese.

09:18.704 --> 09:20.820
Not quite. Hey, Joey.

09:20.898 --> 09:24.873
To congratulate you for
getting your Pathology Match.

09:29.484 --> 09:31.713
Oh, it's beautiful.

09:31.870 --> 09:35.501
Can you read it?
Bubonic plague bacillus.

09:35.900 --> 09:37.232
That's amazing.

09:37.257 --> 09:40.176
It's from the Royal London
Hospital; it's 1893.

09:40.201 --> 09:41.534
Wow.

09:41.562 --> 09:43.102
Do you like it?

09:43.127 --> 09:45.027
I love it.

09:45.331 --> 09:47.998
Joey, I am so sorry.
I have to steal her.

09:48.023 --> 09:49.513
Dr. Halstead in 4.

09:49.538 --> 09:51.171
Thank you.

09:52.629 --> 09:54.587
Reese.

09:55.176 --> 09:57.468
Spit out your gum.

10:01.897 --> 10:03.663
- Any pain?
- Nope.

10:03.688 --> 10:04.821
Dr. Halstead?

10:04.992 --> 10:07.259
Mr. Kellogg, this is Ms. Reese,

10:07.284 --> 10:09.451
fourth year med student,
soon to be doctor.

10:09.476 --> 10:10.608
Congratulations.

10:10.633 --> 10:12.328
Grab a hammer, will you?

10:12.425 --> 10:15.812
Mr. Kellogg is a gymnastics teacher.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.716
I fell.

10:17.741 --> 10:19.526
Honestly, I'm...  I'm not hurt actually.

10:19.551 --> 10:21.317
It just... it happened
on school property,

10:21.342 --> 10:23.577
so I gotta get a doctor's note.

10:23.602 --> 10:24.949
Pupils look good.

10:24.974 --> 10:26.203
Ms. Reese is gonna check your reflexes,

10:26.228 --> 10:28.328
then we'll get you out of here, okay?

10:34.720 --> 10:36.953
[exhales]

10:37.356 --> 10:40.409
- You okay?
- Yeah, fine.

10:51.196 --> 10:54.289
[distorted] You okay?

10:58.242 --> 10:59.820
- Oh...
- Reese!

10:59.845 --> 11:01.851
Oh, whoa!

11:04.435 --> 11:07.269
So it's pretty clear what bones
in the wrist are affected.

11:07.294 --> 11:09.773
But what I'm actually
curious about is this.

11:10.125 --> 11:14.070
This is a previous fracture...
One that's already healed.

11:14.130 --> 11:15.329
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:15.354 --> 11:17.603
I don't remember seeing
it in Bo's history.

11:17.790 --> 11:20.789
Hey, sorry. Got here as soon as I could.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.280
How's Bo? His wrist got broken, Daddy.

11:23.305 --> 11:25.616
I'm afraid your son's
gonna need surgery.

11:25.641 --> 11:28.340
Oh, God, you hurt yourself
pretty good, huh, big guy?

11:28.365 --> 11:30.834
Dr. Manning was just
showing me Bo's X-Ray.

11:30.859 --> 11:35.064
Appears that he's broken his arm
before and we didn't realize it.

11:35.090 --> 11:36.623
Oh.

11:36.683 --> 11:38.056
Well, that must have been from last year

11:38.081 --> 11:39.487
when he fell down the stairs.

11:39.512 --> 11:42.222
He hardly complained; we
just thought it was a sprain.

11:42.247 --> 11:43.713
Remember that?

11:43.738 --> 11:45.199
Mm-hmm.

11:45.275 --> 11:48.242
Poor Bo. Bo's hand is cold.

11:48.267 --> 11:49.833
Griffin, don't touch
your brother's hand.

11:49.858 --> 11:51.302
- Aaron...
- Sorry, I just...

11:51.327 --> 11:52.666
I don't want him making it worse.

11:52.691 --> 11:54.362
It is cold.

11:55.050 --> 11:57.905
The capillary refill's delayed.
Wait, what does that mean?

11:57.930 --> 11:59.923
He's losing circulation.
Not enough blood flow.

11:59.948 --> 12:01.114
April, call the OR.

12:01.139 --> 12:02.313
Tell them we're on our way up right now.

12:02.338 --> 12:05.305
- Got it. Christy.
- Excuse me.

12:18.547 --> 12:21.287
- I'm so embarrassed.
- Don't be.

12:21.312 --> 12:22.516
You fainted.

12:22.541 --> 12:24.560
Yeah, right on top of that
poor gymnastics teacher.

12:24.585 --> 12:25.742
Did he say anything?

12:25.767 --> 12:28.619
Only that he was very
impressed with your dismount.

12:30.713 --> 12:32.584
Reese, your EKG and BP are normal,

12:32.609 --> 12:33.781
so I think what we're looking at...

12:33.806 --> 12:36.039
Is a vasovagal syncope, right?

12:36.064 --> 12:37.164
Probably.

12:37.189 --> 12:38.933
Just gotta figure out
what the trigger is.

12:38.958 --> 12:41.078
- Okay.
- You know, maybe blood sugar.

12:41.102 --> 12:42.869
- Let's get you some orange juice.
- Yeah.

12:42.894 --> 12:44.193
Thanks, Mel.

12:46.280 --> 12:50.224
Well, I'm no Dr. Charles, but
is everything okay with you?

12:50.249 --> 12:52.286
Everything's great.

12:53.210 --> 12:55.629
The... oh, the tuba
player living above me?

12:55.654 --> 12:56.767
He finally moved out.

12:56.792 --> 12:59.198
And of course, I just
got my Pathology match.

12:59.222 --> 13:02.093
And, oh...  Look.

13:02.770 --> 13:06.968
Joey gave me the bubonic plague.

13:07.221 --> 13:08.693
Wow.

13:08.720 --> 13:10.219
He must really like you.

13:10.244 --> 13:11.814
He does. [sighs]

13:11.839 --> 13:15.015
And he's very excited about
me going into pathology.

13:15.040 --> 13:16.539
We're both excited.

13:16.711 --> 13:19.272
You know, Dr. Halstead,
I'm sure this was nothing.

13:19.366 --> 13:20.832
Probably.

13:20.857 --> 13:22.709
But just to be safe, let's order a CBC

13:22.734 --> 13:24.209
and we'll take it from there, all right?

13:24.234 --> 13:25.633
Okay.

13:32.746 --> 13:36.181
All right. The patch is done.

13:36.206 --> 13:38.738
And the heart's closed up.

13:39.609 --> 13:41.576
Okay, then. Moment of truth.

13:41.601 --> 13:43.859
Give warm blood cardioplegia
to restart the heart.

13:43.884 --> 13:46.935
- Yes Doctor.
- I'll need sutures for the chest.

13:48.793 --> 13:51.021
She's in third degree
complete heart block.

13:51.046 --> 13:52.538
I can see that, Marty.

13:52.563 --> 13:54.262
What do you want me to do?

13:54.287 --> 13:57.780
- Dr. Rhodes?
- Relax. Hold on the pump.

13:57.805 --> 14:01.215
One of the patch sutures must've
bagged the conducting system.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.507
- Mm-hmm.
- Suture cutters.

14:06.782 --> 14:09.652
That one. Here.

14:13.765 --> 14:15.398
Normal sinus rhythm.

14:15.446 --> 14:18.136
Good call.

14:18.955 --> 14:20.649
Because of the edema in the boy's hand,

14:20.674 --> 14:22.172
I'd say he broke his wrist

14:22.197 --> 14:24.939
at least 24 hours ago, if not longer.

14:25.228 --> 14:27.353
Also, she said he hit a patch of gravel.

14:27.378 --> 14:29.345
You'd expect there to be
abrasions on his hand,

14:29.370 --> 14:30.539
but there are none.

14:30.564 --> 14:32.548
Combine that with the
previous fracture...

14:32.573 --> 14:34.773
You suspect abuse?

14:34.843 --> 14:36.306
I don't know. Maybe.

14:36.331 --> 14:38.565
- Where's the boy now?
- In surgery.

14:38.580 --> 14:41.125
Dr. Reyes feels confident
he'll be able to save his hand.

14:41.150 --> 14:42.884
- Thank goodness for that.
- Yeah.

14:42.909 --> 14:45.776
And you said there's an
older brother as well?

14:45.788 --> 14:46.887
Griffin. He's ten.

14:46.912 --> 14:49.312
Well, if there's a possibility of abuse,

14:49.337 --> 14:50.968
we have to protect those children.

14:50.993 --> 14:53.928
I just... I don't want
to rush to judgment.

14:53.953 --> 14:56.477
I feel like my radar
has been off lately.

14:56.502 --> 14:58.390
You're referring to
the shaken baby case?

14:58.415 --> 15:00.883
We put that woman through
hell, and she was blameless.

15:00.908 --> 15:03.275
Well, before we call DCFS,

15:03.300 --> 15:05.524
let's get a second opinion.

15:06.107 --> 15:08.570
I know we're supposed to keep
our emotions out of the OR

15:08.595 --> 15:10.453
but every time we get
one of those newborns,

15:10.478 --> 15:12.938
I'm just a wreck, even when
it turns out all right.

15:12.963 --> 15:15.385
Amazing how you keep your cool.

15:15.599 --> 15:17.853
He's an ace, Dr. Downey.

15:17.878 --> 15:20.183
Yes, he is.

15:21.896 --> 15:24.495
- Nice work in there.
- Thank you.

15:24.654 --> 15:27.121
Where you going?

15:27.217 --> 15:29.220
I gotta get back down to the ED.

15:29.245 --> 15:31.343
And miss the best part?

15:31.368 --> 15:34.853
Telling the family their
baby's gonna be just fine.

15:35.783 --> 15:38.110
The honor is yours, Dr. Rhodes.

15:44.043 --> 15:46.171
Mr. Coleman'll be ready to
transfer in the morning.

15:46.196 --> 15:49.055
Good, I've got him set up
with psychiatry first thing.

15:49.080 --> 15:50.400
Hopefully the right meds and therapy

15:50.425 --> 15:52.225
will help get this under control.

15:52.250 --> 15:53.783
Good luck with that.

15:55.424 --> 15:57.570
Mr. Coleman, this is Dr. Glass.

15:57.595 --> 15:59.415
She'll be supervising
your care at the V.A.

15:59.440 --> 16:01.123
Oh, fantastic.

16:01.148 --> 16:02.659
Nice to meet you.

16:02.684 --> 16:04.400
I heard the surgery was a success.

16:04.425 --> 16:05.958
No, it wasn't.

16:05.983 --> 16:07.812
I still hear the beating.

16:07.837 --> 16:11.181
Auditory hallucinations are complicated.

16:11.259 --> 16:14.336
It's not an hallucination.

16:15.864 --> 16:18.632
Whatever it is, we want
to help figure that out.

16:18.800 --> 16:22.446
Now Dr. Charles has contacted
a psychiatrist at the V.A.

16:22.471 --> 16:24.672
Should follow up this afternoon.

16:24.706 --> 16:27.390
It's useless talking to you people.

16:27.415 --> 16:31.046
Dr. Choi, would you like to weight in?

16:34.087 --> 16:38.055
It's possible Mr. Coleman is right.

16:39.302 --> 16:41.603
I think we should get a chest CT.

16:46.294 --> 16:47.844
What's the brother's name again?

16:47.869 --> 16:49.524
Griffin. Wait... wait a second.

16:49.549 --> 16:51.236
I already challenged them on the injury.

16:51.261 --> 16:53.428
Now I walk in with a psychiatrist?

16:55.136 --> 16:56.502
So who're you gonna be?

16:56.527 --> 16:58.927
Still me. Just, uh...

16:58.952 --> 17:00.681
not advertising.

17:00.706 --> 17:02.172
Okay.

17:04.969 --> 17:07.698
- Hi.
- Dr. Manning, how's Bo?

17:07.723 --> 17:09.141
Are they still operating on him?

17:09.165 --> 17:11.614
Last we heard, he's doing very well.

17:11.638 --> 17:13.739
- You must be Griffin.
- Yes, sir.

17:13.804 --> 17:15.212
I'm Dr. Charles. Nice to meet you.

17:15.237 --> 17:16.487
Nice to meet you too.

17:16.512 --> 17:18.584
As soon as Bo moves up to
the ICU, I'll let you know.

17:18.608 --> 17:20.442
When he comes home, I'm
gonna take care of him.

17:20.467 --> 17:21.150
Griffin.

17:21.175 --> 17:23.410
Ms. Taylor, Dr. Manning told
me that you burned your hand.

17:23.435 --> 17:25.723
Would you like us to redress
that while you're here?

17:25.749 --> 17:28.861
No, no, no, it's... it's
fine. It's practically healed.

17:28.886 --> 17:31.053
[giggles] Mommy's clumsy.

17:31.078 --> 17:32.798
Is there a reason you're here, Doctor?

17:33.244 --> 17:35.499
Well, waiting for a child
to come out of surgery,

17:35.524 --> 17:37.624
that's a stressful time
for... for any family,

17:37.649 --> 17:39.216
and we like to make ourselves available

17:39.241 --> 17:42.014
for questions, concerns.

17:42.039 --> 17:43.752
I thought you just said
the surgery was going well.

17:43.777 --> 17:44.854
It is.

17:44.917 --> 17:46.817
So why would we need to talk to anyone?

17:46.842 --> 17:48.074
Aaron, please.

17:48.099 --> 17:49.499
Look, can't you see what this is?

17:49.524 --> 17:51.663
This phony concern for your hand?

17:51.688 --> 17:53.400
Is Daddy in trouble again, Mommy?

17:53.425 --> 17:56.459
- No... no, honey.
- Doctor, let's step outside.

17:56.484 --> 17:59.082
- Can I come with you?
- You stay here, Griffin.

18:01.168 --> 18:03.614
I'm not stupid. I've
been waiting for this.

18:03.639 --> 18:05.005
You think I abuse my family?

18:05.030 --> 18:07.404
We do have a-a couple of questions.

18:07.429 --> 18:09.881
I didn't touch my boy or my wife,

18:09.906 --> 18:11.556
and if you think I did, that's fine.

18:11.581 --> 18:13.414
You call family services,
call the police,

18:13.439 --> 18:14.923
have 'em give me a lie detector test.

18:14.948 --> 18:16.515
I don't care.

18:16.540 --> 18:19.075
Now if you'll excuse me.

18:21.579 --> 18:22.900
What do you think?

18:22.925 --> 18:25.835
I don't know. I mean,
something's off, right?

18:25.860 --> 18:27.759
I think so.

18:27.953 --> 18:29.837
Let's call his bluff.

18:35.955 --> 18:37.718
Hey, Reese. How you feelin'?

18:37.743 --> 18:38.676
Fine.

18:38.701 --> 18:39.874
Haven't seen a swoon like that

18:39.899 --> 18:41.590
since I took my niece
to see Justin Bieber.

18:41.615 --> 18:42.914
And she just...  Oh!

18:42.939 --> 18:44.337
I'm fine. It was nothing.

18:44.362 --> 18:46.795
[chuckles] Glad to hear it.

18:47.604 --> 18:48.803
Hey, is everything okay?

18:48.828 --> 18:51.095
Why do people keep asking me that? Yes.

18:51.120 --> 18:53.414
Dr. Halstead ordered
a full panel on you.

18:53.439 --> 18:54.538
Did something happen?

18:54.563 --> 18:56.617
How is that any of your business, Joey?

18:56.642 --> 18:57.939
I thought you were supposed
to be running the labs,

18:57.964 --> 18:59.464
not interrogating patients.

18:59.489 --> 19:01.255
Sorry. I was just concerned about you.

19:01.280 --> 19:02.946
It's just unprofessional, Joey.

19:02.971 --> 19:06.092
There is a protocol in the
ED. It's not like pathology.

19:06.310 --> 19:08.169
Okay.

19:08.702 --> 19:10.264
Well, here. Um...

19:10.500 --> 19:12.961
Everything came back normal.

19:13.103 --> 19:14.898
See?

19:15.842 --> 19:17.875
Well, don't give it me.

19:17.900 --> 19:19.867
Give it to Dr. Halstead.

19:22.399 --> 19:24.776
Okay.

19:26.582 --> 19:29.349
Mr. Coleman, the CT scan
we took of your chest

19:29.374 --> 19:32.400
showed a lot of scar tissue
from your shrapnel wounds.

19:32.441 --> 19:33.840
So?

19:33.865 --> 19:37.375
It's not affecting your health
or your heart functions.

19:37.400 --> 19:40.217
But this scar tissue has
created a malformation

19:40.242 --> 19:42.643
which acts like an echo chamber.

19:43.199 --> 19:46.296
It amplifies the sound
waves of your heart.

19:46.899 --> 19:50.434
I could see it affecting a
dish of Jell-O on your tray.

19:51.211 --> 19:53.490
So I was right.

19:53.970 --> 19:55.344
It is physical.

19:55.369 --> 19:58.770
Yes, the vibration carries
up to your inner ear.

19:58.939 --> 20:02.807
You really are hearing your
heart pounding in your head.

20:03.017 --> 20:06.380
God. Finally.

20:06.405 --> 20:10.657
So what are you gonna
do to make it stop?

20:14.031 --> 20:16.298
I'm afraid there's nothing we can do.

20:16.323 --> 20:19.491
Come on, an... an operation maybe?

20:19.516 --> 20:21.384
There's too much scar tissue,

20:21.495 --> 20:23.080
and it's too close to the heart.

20:23.105 --> 20:25.296
An operation just isn't feasible.

20:26.744 --> 20:28.577
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

20:28.602 --> 20:32.767
You gotta do something.
This is driving me crazy.

20:32.792 --> 20:34.517
Listen to me.

20:34.818 --> 20:37.501
We'll talk to Ear, Nose, and Throat.

20:37.921 --> 20:39.087
See if there are any options.

20:39.112 --> 20:40.806
Please, please, do that. [sobbing]

20:40.831 --> 20:43.626
Please. [grunting]

20:43.651 --> 20:47.454
[panting]

20:56.110 --> 20:59.500
I've spoken to the Department
of Child and Family Services.

20:59.525 --> 21:00.791
They'll be here in an hour.

21:00.816 --> 21:02.282
Thank you.

21:20.695 --> 21:23.791
Dr. Rhodes, trauma one incoming.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.235
Talk to me.

21:25.260 --> 21:27.828
18-year-old female hit a
guard rail, flipped her car.

21:27.853 --> 21:30.609
Open left tib/fib, BP 90/75.

21:30.634 --> 21:33.400
- Rotate.
- Heart rate 130, GCS 10.

21:33.425 --> 21:34.861
All right, she's gonna need ortho.

21:34.886 --> 21:36.610
Call X-Ray. Alert the OR.

21:36.635 --> 21:37.801
Got it.

21:37.826 --> 21:40.876
- One, two, three.
- Transfer.

21:40.901 --> 21:42.761
It's okay, sweetie.

21:42.915 --> 21:44.496
- Let go of the purse; it's okay.
- Give her the purse.

21:44.521 --> 21:45.494
- Let go.
- It's okay.

21:45.519 --> 21:46.781
You can give her the purse, okay?

21:46.806 --> 21:48.139
You can give her the purse, okay.

21:48.164 --> 21:49.875
Hey, I'm Dr. Rhodes, okay?

21:49.900 --> 21:51.289
Maggie, see if you can find me a name.

21:51.314 --> 21:52.197
Looking for it now.

21:52.222 --> 21:54.192
Dr. Rhodes. Skyler.

21:54.217 --> 21:55.460
Hey, Skyler, listen to me.

21:55.485 --> 21:57.525
You were in a car accident,
and you broke your leg,

21:57.550 --> 21:59.267
but we're gonna take care of you, okay?

21:59.292 --> 22:00.859
Hey, see if you can find her family.

22:00.884 --> 22:02.367
Got you. Sweetie, I have your purse.

22:02.392 --> 22:04.212
Thank you. [crying] Thank you.

22:04.237 --> 22:05.769
BP's crashing.

22:05.794 --> 22:07.955
- Pulse ox is 78.
- She's lost consciousness.

22:07.980 --> 22:10.347
Give me 100 of Sux, 20 of Etomidate.

22:10.372 --> 22:12.345
- Need a hand?
- Yep, throw in a tube.

22:12.370 --> 22:13.936
- On it.
- Tube and scope ready, Doc.

22:13.961 --> 22:16.394
- Hang a Mag and KRider.
- Got it.

22:16.863 --> 22:19.140
She's bleeding from somewhere.

22:19.165 --> 22:21.782
Get the level one
transfuser, trigger the MTP.

22:21.807 --> 22:25.022
I need the FAST scan and a chest X-Ray.

22:25.047 --> 22:26.855
- On it.
- Move it here.

22:26.881 --> 22:29.065
Blood is on its way.

22:29.089 --> 22:30.575
I'm in.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.566
All right, there's no
free fluid in her belly.

22:32.592 --> 22:34.492
Get the X-Ray in here.

22:34.672 --> 22:36.056
Dr. Rhodes, take over.

22:36.081 --> 22:37.704
- Got it.
- Increase O2 to max.

22:37.729 --> 22:39.237
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

22:39.262 --> 22:41.569
- Get her on the board.
- Coming in.

22:41.594 --> 22:44.401
- X-Ray, clear.
- Clear!

22:45.488 --> 22:46.921
Her left side is whited-out,

22:46.946 --> 22:48.679
and her mediastinum's
shifted to the right.

22:48.704 --> 22:51.197
Tension haemothorax. Chest
tube tray now. 36 French.

22:51.222 --> 22:52.489
Got it.

22:52.514 --> 22:54.513
- Gown.
- Here you go.

22:54.805 --> 22:56.671
- Hand me the trauma shears.
- Here you go.

22:56.696 --> 22:58.834
Airway clear.

22:58.957 --> 23:02.126
- Dr. Halstead.
- Thank you.

23:02.495 --> 23:04.496
Get the pleur vac.

23:04.844 --> 23:07.893
- Set up for suction.
- All right.

23:07.918 --> 23:09.853
Coming through.

23:13.640 --> 23:15.006
I've got it now. Suction's prepped.

23:15.031 --> 23:17.607
- Stand by.
- We need more sponges.

23:17.632 --> 23:18.818
- Yes, doctor.
- More four by fours.

23:18.843 --> 23:20.407
She tore something major in there.

23:20.625 --> 23:22.325
Transfuser's here.

23:22.350 --> 23:24.283
Hook it up... start with
the blood and the plasma.

23:24.308 --> 23:25.505
- Got it.
- Starting now.

23:25.530 --> 23:27.478
All right, we need some
more lab sponge in here.

23:27.503 --> 23:30.651
- We're going up to the OR now.
- Yep.

24:09.131 --> 24:11.771
Hi, Dr. Charles.

24:11.796 --> 24:15.232
Hey, Griffin. Where're
your... your parents?

24:15.257 --> 24:17.585
Dad went to get some pop. Mom
had to go to the bathroom.

24:17.610 --> 24:18.945
Oh.

24:19.233 --> 24:20.466
What'd you find?

24:20.491 --> 24:21.572
Nothing.

24:21.597 --> 24:24.052
I thought I saw you pick something up.

24:24.077 --> 24:26.284
Oh. A button.

24:26.309 --> 24:29.029
It's that lady's. Oh,
the one who got hurt.

24:29.054 --> 24:30.411
Uh-huh.

24:30.436 --> 24:32.039
Yeah.

24:32.246 --> 24:34.638
What you gonna do with it?

24:34.753 --> 24:38.438
Give it to the nurse, so
the lady can get it back.

24:38.463 --> 24:40.123
I'm not in trouble, am I?

24:40.148 --> 24:42.183
No.

24:42.208 --> 24:43.640
But you know what, let's...

24:43.665 --> 24:46.999
Let's find Mom and Dad.
It's kind of a scary place.

24:47.024 --> 24:49.199
I'm not scared.

24:49.912 --> 24:52.207
No?

24:53.094 --> 24:55.303
I want to be a doctor.

24:56.597 --> 24:58.196
Really?

24:58.221 --> 24:59.757
Why's that?

24:59.782 --> 25:01.687
The knives.

25:01.712 --> 25:03.928
What?

25:04.416 --> 25:06.516
To help people.

25:06.785 --> 25:09.119
There you are, honey.

25:09.405 --> 25:11.286
I told you to stay put.

25:11.311 --> 25:14.887
- I got bored.
- Okay, come on, let's go.

25:23.306 --> 25:25.608
- Rib spreader.
- Yes, Doctor.

25:27.771 --> 25:29.437
Dr. Rhodes.

25:29.462 --> 25:31.849
Blunt force trauma, massive
left-sided bleeding.

25:31.874 --> 25:34.311
4 PRBC's and 4 plasma given.

25:34.336 --> 25:35.935
Had a hard time getting her under,

25:35.960 --> 25:37.852
but there's no time left.

25:37.877 --> 25:39.410
So here we go.

25:39.435 --> 25:41.339
Long metz and Debakeys to me.

25:41.364 --> 25:43.515
I'll get the lung out of the way.

25:49.736 --> 25:53.067
She's moving. Marty?

25:53.092 --> 25:55.372
I've given her plenty of Roc,
but it's not circulating.

25:55.397 --> 25:56.596
I can't relax her.

25:56.621 --> 25:59.067
I'm opening the pericardium.

26:04.277 --> 26:05.987
Damn it.

26:06.012 --> 26:09.116
Right atrium's torn clear off the cava.

26:09.763 --> 26:12.979
Give me a Satinsky.
Gotta try to clamp it.

26:13.079 --> 26:15.107
[gasping]

26:20.439 --> 26:24.579
[monitor flatlining]

26:32.451 --> 26:34.897
She's gone.

26:36.589 --> 26:38.865
Dr. Rhodes?

26:44.636 --> 26:48.749
Time of death: 14:21.

27:00.280 --> 27:03.275
Just spoke to my guys at the V.A.

27:03.873 --> 27:06.240
There's nothing they
can do for Mr. Coleman.

27:06.265 --> 27:07.689
How 'bout you?

27:07.714 --> 27:10.347
Our ENTs said the same thing.

27:10.890 --> 27:14.707
So how do we keep this guy from
shooting himself in the head?

27:15.327 --> 27:19.505
The thing is, his condition
has a physical cause.

27:19.530 --> 27:22.698
It's not some complex
psychological issue.

27:23.255 --> 27:27.138
It's a matter of Mr. Coleman
learning how to cope with it.

27:27.830 --> 27:29.430
That's a tall order.

27:29.744 --> 27:31.412
I know.

27:31.778 --> 27:35.059
But it's a problem he can
see, you know what I mean?

27:35.996 --> 27:40.443
In a way, isn't it easier to
deal with things you can see?

27:42.642 --> 27:44.653
Yeah.

27:48.307 --> 27:50.358
Yeah.

27:53.381 --> 27:55.540
So, it's not the father?

27:55.565 --> 27:56.747
In my opinion, no.

27:56.772 --> 27:59.723
I think the father...
Very possibly both parents

27:59.748 --> 28:00.805
are protecting Griffin.

28:00.830 --> 28:02.884
A sociopath, really?

28:02.909 --> 28:05.034
He's just a little boy; he's only ten.

28:05.059 --> 28:07.452
Sociopathic traits are identifiable

28:07.477 --> 28:09.405
in very young children, infants even.

28:09.468 --> 28:10.922
Couldn't the picking up of the button

28:10.947 --> 28:12.680
just be a normal curiosity?

28:12.705 --> 28:16.384
Most children when confronted
with such a horrific event

28:16.409 --> 28:19.016
would be repelled. They'd
be frightened, upset.

28:19.041 --> 28:20.585
He was drawn to it.

28:20.865 --> 28:22.831
And then to... to focus on an object

28:22.856 --> 28:25.764
instead of the person who had
been so terribly injured...

28:25.789 --> 28:28.528
I think that Griffin's
a danger to that boy...

28:28.781 --> 28:30.327
The whole family.

28:30.352 --> 28:32.780
I mean, the burn on the mother's arm?

28:32.805 --> 28:33.863
What... what's that about?

28:33.888 --> 28:35.540
Okay, so what can we do?

28:35.565 --> 28:37.133
Very little.

28:37.158 --> 28:40.850
We inform DCFS of Dr. Charles's opinion.

28:40.875 --> 28:44.287
If they deem Griffin a threat
to his brother and his parents,

28:44.312 --> 28:46.992
they'll recommend removing
him from the house.

28:47.017 --> 28:50.052
But it's only a recommendation.

28:50.077 --> 28:52.195
They can't force the issue.

28:52.220 --> 28:54.687
The parents have to take that step.

29:01.429 --> 29:03.224
Her pericardium was filled with blood.

29:03.249 --> 29:05.177
She was bleeding to death
inside of her chest.

29:05.202 --> 29:06.933
That's why the anesthesia
wasn't working.

29:06.958 --> 29:08.833
It wasn't circulating.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.947
I better go notify the family.

29:10.972 --> 29:12.849
I'll do that.

29:13.055 --> 29:15.366
You should get back to the ED.

29:16.707 --> 29:18.560
Okay.

29:25.866 --> 29:27.824
Reese, you okay?

29:27.849 --> 29:29.774
Uh-uh.

29:32.060 --> 29:34.139
It happen again?

29:34.937 --> 29:36.910
Vertigo.

29:37.132 --> 29:39.432
Maybe something <i> is</i> going on.

29:39.542 --> 29:41.537
We should run some more tests.

29:43.204 --> 29:47.217
[sighs] No. I know what it is.

29:50.710 --> 29:52.910
Pathology.

30:01.241 --> 30:03.185
What... what is...  What are we doing?

30:03.210 --> 30:04.335
What is all this?

30:04.360 --> 30:07.052
There's something we'd like to show you.

30:11.338 --> 30:13.644
There.

30:13.731 --> 30:16.465
We wanted you to meet
your brother-in-arms.

30:16.669 --> 30:18.864
- Brother-in-arms?
- Yes.

30:19.311 --> 30:20.962
Your heart.

30:20.987 --> 30:23.821
Do you see how hard your
heart is fighting for you?

30:23.846 --> 30:26.014
Fighting to keep you alive.

30:28.172 --> 30:31.364
Mr. Coleman, we can't make you
the person you were before.

30:31.600 --> 30:34.519
And dealing with this is
going to be a long process.

30:35.104 --> 30:37.404
But it would help if you
could begin to think about

30:37.429 --> 30:39.457
that pounding in your
head in a different way.

30:39.482 --> 30:41.791
More like a reminder.

30:43.428 --> 30:46.967
A reassuring, comforting sound...

30:46.992 --> 30:49.318
That your heart is there for you.

31:03.671 --> 31:07.002
[crying]

31:11.371 --> 31:15.825
Wow! You don't have to do this.

31:15.850 --> 31:16.849
I'm happy to.

31:16.874 --> 31:18.106
What are you gonna make me?

31:18.140 --> 31:19.100
A rocket ship.

31:19.125 --> 31:20.792
Ooh, I can't wait.

31:20.817 --> 31:21.997
Thanks.

31:22.022 --> 31:24.141
I'll see you tonight.

31:24.984 --> 31:27.701
Mr. and Mrs. Taylor?

31:27.826 --> 31:29.974
I understand Bo's surgery went well.

31:29.999 --> 31:31.122
Have you been up to see him?

31:31.147 --> 31:33.200
Yes. He was still asleep, though.

31:33.225 --> 31:36.926
Listen, we owe you both
something of an apology.

31:36.951 --> 31:39.233
We were wrong about your situation.

31:39.258 --> 31:40.982
Could we step into the consultation room

31:41.007 --> 31:42.171
so that I can explain?

31:42.196 --> 31:43.738
What about Griffin?

31:43.763 --> 31:45.696
You can watch him from in there.

31:45.721 --> 31:47.433
All right.

31:47.801 --> 31:50.192
Griffin, honey, you stay
here. We'll be right back.

31:50.217 --> 31:51.784
Okay.

32:05.835 --> 32:09.970
Mr. Taylor, I don't believe
that you are an abuser.

32:11.755 --> 32:14.292
But I do think that you
are covering up for one.

32:14.317 --> 32:15.850
Your son, Griffin.

32:15.875 --> 32:19.224
[scoffs] That's ridiculous.

32:19.249 --> 32:21.291
We're concerned for Bo's safety.

32:21.316 --> 32:22.889
And yours, frankly.

32:22.914 --> 32:25.163
We're talking about a little boy here.

32:25.188 --> 32:26.569
Who has been exhibiting

32:26.594 --> 32:29.228
some very serious anti-social behavior.

32:29.326 --> 32:32.044
Look, you just met our son.
You can judge him like that?

32:32.069 --> 32:33.905
I would love to be wrong about this.

32:33.930 --> 32:36.597
And you should have Griffin
thoroughly evaluated.

32:36.622 --> 32:38.975
But if indeed we're talking
about psychopathy here...

32:39.000 --> 32:40.810
Psych...  Psychopathy.

32:40.835 --> 32:42.115
He's still young.

32:42.140 --> 32:43.850
His brain is still developing.

32:43.875 --> 32:45.802
There are very real things we can do

32:45.827 --> 32:47.034
to intervene and help him.

32:47.066 --> 32:48.694
Behavioral therapy has shown...

32:48.720 --> 32:50.598
No, no, we're not listening
to any more of this.

32:50.623 --> 32:52.557
- Nedra.
- I recommend you do.

32:52.675 --> 32:54.273
Because if you don't,

32:54.298 --> 32:57.179
ultimately, Griffin may have
to be removed from your home.

32:57.204 --> 32:58.658
- No.
- Let's go.

32:58.683 --> 33:02.070
Wait...  Where's Griffin?

33:11.984 --> 33:13.678
[electronic alarm beeping]

33:13.703 --> 33:16.804
[whimpering]

33:17.561 --> 33:21.658
- Griffin!
- Griffin!

33:23.336 --> 33:25.644
Griffin?

33:27.702 --> 33:30.547
- What did you do?
- Nothing!

33:31.236 --> 33:32.935
Blood pressure spiking. Heart's racing.

33:32.960 --> 33:34.882
- Get away from your brother.
- I didn't do anything!

33:34.907 --> 33:36.857
[sobbing] Oh, my God,
sweetie, it's okay.

33:36.882 --> 33:39.092
Mommy's here. Mommy's
here. Mommy's here.

33:39.117 --> 33:40.650
Heart rate, BP's coming down.

33:40.675 --> 33:42.175
What's happening to Bo?

33:42.203 --> 33:44.508
He's terrified.

33:44.799 --> 33:47.608
Fear response is an involuntary reflex.

33:47.633 --> 33:49.686
Even though he's heavily medicated,

33:49.711 --> 33:51.593
he's aware he's in danger.

33:51.618 --> 33:54.483
[sobbing] Sweet boy.

33:56.356 --> 33:58.835
My poor boy.

33:59.387 --> 34:00.849
Mrs. Taylor...

34:00.874 --> 34:03.237
[crying]

34:03.262 --> 34:05.874
Mrs. Taylor, you know
you have a problem.

34:05.899 --> 34:08.543
Please let us help your family.

34:20.960 --> 34:23.466
I've been looking for you.

34:23.839 --> 34:26.393
Why, so you can yell at me some more?

34:26.418 --> 34:28.913
No. I wanted to say I'm sorry.

34:28.938 --> 34:30.905
And to ask you something.

34:30.929 --> 34:33.397
Okay.

34:33.422 --> 34:36.051
First, I really do
love the plague slide.

34:36.076 --> 34:38.793
It was very thoughtful.

34:39.360 --> 34:40.842
But...

34:40.867 --> 34:42.735
[exhales forcefully]

34:42.761 --> 34:45.648
Will you still like me if
I don't go into pathology?

34:46.297 --> 34:48.474
You're not going into pathology?

34:48.498 --> 34:50.592
I want to be in the ED.

34:50.618 --> 34:53.585
I actually like treating patients.

34:53.983 --> 34:55.815
Okay.

34:55.841 --> 34:57.618
Really? Okay?

34:57.643 --> 35:01.811
Reese, you gotta get over yourself.

35:03.005 --> 35:05.097
I know I do.

35:05.122 --> 35:08.092
You're so sweet. Thanks.

35:22.718 --> 35:27.482
DCFS recommended that Griffin
be separated from the family.

35:27.507 --> 35:29.502
- Good.
- No.

35:29.527 --> 35:31.794
The Taylors aren't going to do it.

35:31.819 --> 35:33.285
What?

35:33.310 --> 35:35.400
I don't understand. They saw.

35:35.425 --> 35:38.117
"Heart will not accept
what the eye can see."

35:38.230 --> 35:40.764
Willful blindness, right?

35:41.222 --> 35:44.045
I'm afraid this is not gonna end well.

35:45.028 --> 35:47.902
I wish we could have
done more, Dr. Manning.

35:47.927 --> 35:50.227
Yeah.

35:51.839 --> 35:54.013
Hey!

35:54.038 --> 35:56.333
Bet it felt good to
get out of that room.

35:56.358 --> 35:57.413
Uh-huh.

35:57.438 --> 36:00.429
Is that the amazing
rocket ship you made?

36:00.454 --> 36:02.171
Gotta get you to bed.

36:02.196 --> 36:03.997
Will you come say good night?

36:04.022 --> 36:05.420
You know I will.

36:05.445 --> 36:08.545
April, I've been thinking
about what you said,

36:08.570 --> 36:10.912
the transference stuff.

36:10.936 --> 36:12.921
I see you're a great nurse,

36:12.946 --> 36:14.912
but that's not why I
want to go out with you.

36:14.937 --> 36:16.237
Okay?

36:16.262 --> 36:17.901
Okay.

36:24.320 --> 36:27.725
You're wrong about him. He's a good guy

36:29.152 --> 36:31.100
Let's hope.

36:34.993 --> 36:37.280
Good night, Christy.

36:38.720 --> 36:41.121
- Ms. Goodwin.
- Ms. Reese?

36:41.146 --> 36:44.466
I was wondering, is there any
way that I can undo my match?

36:44.491 --> 36:45.702
Come again?

36:45.952 --> 36:48.352
Undo my match in pathology.

36:48.377 --> 36:50.658
Matches are binding.

36:50.955 --> 36:54.088
I understand, but I thought if
you were to say something...

36:54.113 --> 36:57.202
Ms. Reese, it's a legal contract.

36:57.750 --> 36:59.383
Good night.

36:59.408 --> 37:00.674
Good night.

37:03.769 --> 37:06.077
[exhales]

37:06.507 --> 37:08.116
Good night, Dr. Manning.

37:08.141 --> 37:10.118
Good night.

37:27.444 --> 37:29.222
Mrs. Taylor.

37:29.247 --> 37:30.796
Sorry. I'm going up to see Bo.

37:30.821 --> 37:33.394
I heard about your decision.

37:34.151 --> 37:37.318
It's a phase. He'll grow out of it.

37:37.343 --> 37:40.166
You have to protect Bo.

37:42.045 --> 37:44.682
Do you have children?

37:44.936 --> 37:47.233
A son.

37:48.630 --> 37:51.374
And...

37:51.700 --> 37:54.464
what would you do?

37:55.355 --> 37:57.967
Would you send him away?

38:05.426 --> 38:07.559
Hey.

38:07.584 --> 38:09.786
Tough loss today.

38:10.290 --> 38:12.056
Yeah.

38:12.081 --> 38:13.614
Sorry.

38:13.639 --> 38:15.499
Thanks.

38:15.524 --> 38:18.024
Buy you a drink?

38:18.732 --> 38:20.599
Uh...

38:20.624 --> 38:22.401
Yeah, sure.

38:22.426 --> 38:24.159
Great. Meet you at Molly's?

38:24.184 --> 38:25.951
See you there.

38:28.786 --> 38:32.028
You got group at V.A. tomorrow?

38:32.053 --> 38:34.356
Yeah.

38:37.478 --> 38:39.733
You gonna go?

38:43.754 --> 38:46.451
Remember Mr. Coleman.

38:47.739 --> 38:51.085
You, Dr. Choi, have to fight

38:51.110 --> 38:53.777
as hard for yourself as your heart does.

38:55.165 --> 38:57.521
I'll go.

38:57.897 --> 38:59.905
Good.

39:17.882 --> 39:21.534
[sobbing] She's gone.

39:21.559 --> 39:25.189
My baby's gone.

39:25.214 --> 39:28.991
I want her back. [wailing]

39:48.434 --> 39:51.936
[exhales shakily]

39:55.221 --> 39:58.256
[crying]

40:28.601 --> 40:31.092
Okay, if you say so.

40:31.116 --> 40:32.586
What?

40:32.611 --> 40:34.478
- Thank you.
- Appreciate it.

40:34.503 --> 40:35.786
I better go.

40:35.812 --> 40:38.591
Afraid he'll wake up
and I won't be there.

40:38.616 --> 40:39.660
Sure.

40:39.685 --> 40:41.335
God.

40:41.360 --> 40:45.097
Sorry. Not much of a first date.

40:47.819 --> 40:50.577
Mm. It was perfect.

40:50.602 --> 40:54.060
Hey, two beautiful, unescorted ladies.

40:54.085 --> 40:56.638
You're not stepping
out on Bert, are you?

40:56.663 --> 40:58.692
No, he's taking a night course.

40:58.717 --> 41:01.199
Hindi. Three times a week.

41:01.224 --> 41:03.512
- Ooh, okay.
- Yeah.

41:04.407 --> 41:06.741
Bert's not still on
that travel kick, is he?

41:06.813 --> 41:09.527
More than ever.

41:09.657 --> 41:11.772
Huh.

41:17.928 --> 41:20.627
- Hey, Will.
- Hey, Herrmann.

41:20.652 --> 41:24.689
- You seen Connor?
- Nah, not tonight.

41:25.208 --> 41:27.638
Hey.
