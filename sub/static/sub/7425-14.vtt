00:00.774 --> 00:02.502
<i>Previously on</i>
Beauty & the Beast...

00:02.503 --> 00:04.507
You okay, buddy? Who's he?

00:04.508 --> 00:06.209
Uh, I don't know.
A prisoner.

00:09.913 --> 00:12.273
Honestly, it helps more to know
that we stopped these heists

00:12.282 --> 00:14.049
and we got Barnes.

00:14.084 --> 00:16.352
Apparently the ID on that
kidnapper is Frank Darnell.

00:16.386 --> 00:17.953
This guy was just a front man

00:17.988 --> 00:19.688
for whoever
Tony Barnes really is.

00:19.723 --> 00:20.723
Where's the guy
in the cell?

00:20.757 --> 00:22.424
Dana.
Oh, my God, Sam.

00:22.458 --> 00:23.926
<i>We found bone chips.</i>

00:23.960 --> 00:26.461
Darnell has been burning bodies
underneath Sam's cell.

00:26.496 --> 00:27.930
<i>And when I asked him about it,</i>

00:27.964 --> 00:29.197
he denied knowing anything.

00:29.232 --> 00:30.633
Let him think
that his plan is working.

00:30.667 --> 00:32.134
Con the con man.

00:32.168 --> 00:34.048
This con is to make us think
you're the bad guy.

00:34.070 --> 00:35.770
I think we need to let
this thing go off.

00:35.804 --> 00:37.305
If I die,
then the bad guy is gone.

00:37.340 --> 00:39.608
Case closed. He'll think
that you guys will stop

00:39.642 --> 00:41.309
<i>investigating</i>
<i>and he won't have to kill you.</i>

00:43.613 --> 00:44.712
Catherine,
what are you doing here?

00:44.747 --> 00:45.913

Oh.

01:22.116 --> 01:23.384
Where's Gabe?

01:23.418 --> 01:24.818
I came alone.

01:24.852 --> 01:26.053
I wanted to talk.

01:26.087 --> 01:28.055
Okay. About?

01:28.089 --> 01:28.854
About us.

01:28.879 --> 01:30.603
I didn't think

01:59.152 --> 02:00.552
Wow.

02:00.587 --> 02:01.921
And Gabe reacted how,
exactly?

02:01.955 --> 02:03.522
He just smiled.

02:03.556 --> 02:05.091
Smiled as in

02:05.125 --> 02:06.491
he just let it go,

02:06.526 --> 02:08.193
or smiled as in he
wanted to kill you

02:08.228 --> 02:09.661
right then and there?
I think it was the former,

02:09.696 --> 02:11.163
but it could've been the latter.

02:11.198 --> 02:13.132
Wait, it didn't happen during...

02:13.166 --> 02:14.466
No! No.

02:14.500 --> 02:15.834
It happened at dinner,
thank God.

02:15.868 --> 02:18.370
After a few too many margaritas,
obviously.

02:18.404 --> 02:21.440
Gabe is very understanding.
Mm.

02:21.474 --> 02:22.841
I, on the
other hand,

02:22.875 --> 02:24.109
would've gotten
on the next plane

02:24.143 --> 02:25.444
and flown
straight home.

02:25.478 --> 02:27.045
But I'm not the
forgiving type.

02:27.079 --> 02:28.313
Probably why
I'm still single.

02:28.348 --> 02:29.548
Tess, it was an
innocent mistake.

02:29.582 --> 02:31.049
Habit.

02:31.083 --> 02:32.784
And it's not like it
was supposed to be

02:32.818 --> 02:33.952
a romantic
getaway anyway.

02:33.986 --> 02:35.887
What? It wasn't.

02:35.921 --> 02:38.223
We had to make Sam think
that Gabe was really dead,

02:38.257 --> 02:39.557
we took off, that's all.

02:39.591 --> 02:40.792
To Cancun.

02:40.826 --> 02:42.227
You stayed in
a luxury resort,

02:42.261 --> 02:43.494
you got
massages,

02:43.528 --> 02:44.562
you made love...
Okay.

02:44.596 --> 02:45.897
Fine.

02:45.931 --> 02:47.865
It was a little romantic,
all right?

02:47.899 --> 02:50.468
And clearly I still have
issues with Vincent.

02:50.502 --> 02:51.835
Clearly.

02:51.870 --> 02:53.170
It's just hard to let it go

02:53.204 --> 02:54.405
after everything
we've been through.

02:54.439 --> 02:56.006
All the more reason why I need

02:56.040 --> 02:57.241
to stay away from him
for a while.

02:57.276 --> 02:58.133
Gabe?

02:58.134 --> 02:59.101
Vincent.

02:59.135 --> 03:00.602
I need some space,

03:00.636 --> 03:02.104
see if there's actually
a future with Gabe.

03:02.138 --> 03:03.938
Out of sight,
out of mind, right?

03:03.973 --> 03:05.206
Yeah, well, that's
easier said than done

03:05.240 --> 03:06.641
with all of us
trying to bust Sam.

03:06.675 --> 03:08.109
And, of course,
with Gabe dead...

03:10.646 --> 03:14.115
Gabriel Lowan
was a man of peace,

03:14.149 --> 03:15.717
a man who stood up to evil

03:15.751 --> 03:17.318
and faced it head-on.

03:17.352 --> 03:20.488
A man of strength,
a man of courage.

03:20.522 --> 03:22.289
Unafraid and unwilling...
Good thing he doesn't know

03:22.324 --> 03:23.724
about the beast part.
Shh.

03:23.758 --> 03:25.893
What?
We are at a funeral.

03:25.927 --> 03:27.628
Gabe's not really
dead, remember?

03:27.662 --> 03:29.897
Yeah, well, Sam needs
to think that he is.

03:29.931 --> 03:31.365
Yea, though I walk

03:31.400 --> 03:33.200
through the valley of
the shadow of death,

03:33.235 --> 03:34.201
for thou art with me.

03:34.236 --> 03:35.503
Act a little sad,
will you?

03:35.537 --> 03:36.904
The only thing
I'm sad about

03:36.938 --> 03:38.705
is that I froze my
butt off to get here.

03:38.740 --> 03:40.240
Clearly, I'm not
the only one.

03:40.274 --> 03:42.643
Yeah, I think Gabe
expected a better turnout.

03:42.677 --> 03:43.844
Let's not tell him.

03:45.947 --> 03:46.980
Hi.

03:47.015 --> 03:48.682
Hi.
Excuse me.

03:48.716 --> 03:51.151
...thou hast anointed
my head with oil...

03:51.185 --> 03:52.552
Sorry.

03:52.586 --> 03:54.320
Surely, thy loving-kindness

03:54.355 --> 03:56.222
shall follow me all the days...

03:56.257 --> 03:57.524
How's
it going?

03:57.558 --> 03:59.359
Act sad, you're
at a funeral.

04:00.461 --> 04:03.063
But he's not
really dead.

04:05.332 --> 04:07.833
Be strong...

04:07.868 --> 04:09.401
You know, I'm sorry
I'm late,

04:09.436 --> 04:11.637
but I, uh,
I overslept.

04:11.672 --> 04:13.973
Rough night?

04:15.208 --> 04:16.776
Yeah, yeah,
you could say that.

04:16.810 --> 04:18.142
Yeah.

04:19.512 --> 04:21.581
You know, you were right,
Sam is here.

04:21.615 --> 04:24.416
Yeah, well, we knew
he thought Dana was dead.

04:24.451 --> 04:26.452
But I figured he'd want to make
sure that Gabe was dead,

04:26.486 --> 04:29.088
before he continued
with whatever his plan is.

04:29.122 --> 04:31.790
And hopefully we can track down
this Tony Barnes...

04:31.824 --> 04:33.892
Yeah, we can all move
on with our lives.

04:35.562 --> 04:37.929
So, how was
Mexico?

04:39.165 --> 04:40.532
<i>Caliente.</i>

04:47.974 --> 04:49.207
Detective Chandler.

04:49.241 --> 04:51.710
I just wanted to
offer my condolences.

04:51.744 --> 04:53.344
Despite
what he did,

04:53.378 --> 04:54.846
I am truly sorry
for your loss.

04:54.880 --> 04:57.015
Thank you.

04:57.049 --> 04:58.410
How are you holding
up, Mr. Landon?

04:58.417 --> 04:59.950
I don't know.

04:59.985 --> 05:05.189
Can't believe
Dana's really... gone.

05:05.224 --> 05:06.390
I...

05:06.425 --> 05:08.126
I just got her back, too.

05:08.160 --> 05:10.561
Well, I'm sure she's
in a better place.

05:10.596 --> 05:12.563
Any luck
finding the man

05:12.598 --> 05:13.797
responsible
for this?

05:13.832 --> 05:15.733
- Tony Barnes?
- No, sorry.

05:15.767 --> 05:17.234
No leads at all.

05:17.268 --> 05:19.136
The guy really knows
how to cover his tracks.

05:19.170 --> 05:21.238
Well...

05:21.272 --> 05:22.940
I guess we'll
just have

05:22.974 --> 05:25.109
to somehow find
a way to move on.

05:26.444 --> 05:28.211
Good luck.

05:28.246 --> 05:29.579
You, too.

05:29.614 --> 05:31.881
Don't lose him.

05:31.915 --> 05:34.917
Not a chance.

05:34.952 --> 05:36.753
I can't believe you're
just walking away.

05:36.787 --> 05:38.087
Oh, come on.

05:38.122 --> 05:39.822
I'm not about to
tell her how I feel

05:39.857 --> 05:41.090
at her boyfriend's
funeral.

05:41.125 --> 05:42.659
He's not
really dead.

05:42.693 --> 05:45.895
Whoa, okay, that's
beside the point, okay?

05:45.929 --> 05:49.632
You know it's not just
about wanting her.

05:49.667 --> 05:51.267
It's... it's more
than that, you know?

05:51.301 --> 05:52.835
Even if she
wasn't with Gabe,

05:52.870 --> 05:54.671
I'd still have to find
a way to prove to her

05:54.705 --> 05:56.272
that I would
never choose...

05:56.306 --> 05:58.007
beast again.

05:58.042 --> 06:00.476
But you are a beast,
at least partly.

06:00.510 --> 06:01.978
You can't change that.

06:02.012 --> 06:04.413
No, but I can at least

06:04.447 --> 06:07.516
somehow show her that
I can control it better.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.018
How are you going to do that?

06:10.053 --> 06:11.353
Go beast cold turkey?

06:11.388 --> 06:13.489
That's a really
good idea.

06:18.628 --> 06:20.563
Coming!

06:25.301 --> 06:27.202
Hey.
Hey.

06:27.236 --> 06:29.537
So... how was
my funeral?

06:29.572 --> 06:31.039
Touching.
You would've loved it.

06:31.074 --> 06:32.340
Yeah?
Lots of people?

06:32.374 --> 06:33.675
You know...

06:33.710 --> 06:35.243
we only threw it together
pretty last minute,

06:35.277 --> 06:36.611
it was really cold
outside, so...

06:36.645 --> 06:39.113
So <i>not</i> a lot of people.

06:39.147 --> 06:40.381
No, there
were people.

06:40.416 --> 06:41.616
There.

06:41.650 --> 06:43.084
How many?

06:43.118 --> 06:45.853
Okay, Gabe, first of all,

06:45.887 --> 06:47.355
you didn't actually die,

06:47.389 --> 06:48.590
so there's that.

06:48.624 --> 06:49.857
And secondly,

06:49.891 --> 06:51.125
we didn't give people
much notice,

06:51.159 --> 06:52.427
so they just...
they sent flowers.

06:52.461 --> 06:53.894
They sent a lot of flowers.

06:53.929 --> 06:55.295
I sent the flowers.

06:55.330 --> 06:56.931
Oh.

06:56.965 --> 06:59.200
Well, they were
beautiful.

06:59.234 --> 07:00.935
You are a lousy liar.

07:00.969 --> 07:04.004
But thanks for
caring enough to try.

07:04.039 --> 07:05.372
Did Sam show up, at least?

07:05.406 --> 07:07.441
Yes.
And I think he bought it, too.

07:07.475 --> 07:09.110
Tess is trailing him
as we speak.

07:09.144 --> 07:11.345
Good. 'Cause I am going
stir-crazy in here.

07:11.379 --> 07:13.680
The sooner we find
something concrete

07:13.715 --> 07:14.948
to nail Sam with,

07:14.982 --> 07:16.483
the sooner I can
be reborn... again.

07:16.517 --> 07:17.718
Any luck finding Tony Barnes?

07:17.752 --> 07:18.985
No, but get this...

07:19.019 --> 07:20.320
We don't know
much about him,

07:20.355 --> 07:21.688
except that he amassed
a huge fortune

07:21.723 --> 07:23.022
in Manhattan real estate.

07:23.057 --> 07:24.491
But he liquidated his estate

07:24.525 --> 07:25.726
right after Sam went missing.

07:25.760 --> 07:26.761
So?

07:26.786 --> 07:29.002
So, he's like a modern day
Howard Hughes.

07:29.529 --> 07:31.131
Nobody's seen Barnes since.

07:31.165 --> 07:33.085
Yet he's still buying things...
expensive things.

07:36.875 --> 07:38.404
Hey, Tess,
where are you?

07:38.405 --> 07:39.939
St. Benjamin's Hospital.

07:39.974 --> 07:41.841
Sam's visiting a patient here.

07:41.876 --> 07:43.809
Who?

07:43.843 --> 07:45.210
Someone in intensive care,

07:45.245 --> 07:47.280
the quarantine ward.

07:50.049 --> 07:51.284
Sam's leaving.
I gotta go.

07:51.318 --> 07:52.278
Okay. You stay with him,

07:52.298 --> 07:54.178
I'll figure out who's was
visiting him, and why.

07:54.287 --> 07:55.719
Quarantine?
What does that mean?

07:55.744 --> 07:56.689
I don't know,

07:56.690 --> 07:58.391
but I'm going to go to
the hospital and find out.

07:58.425 --> 08:00.159
Well, y-you
can't go alone.

08:00.193 --> 08:02.694
Why? Sam's already left.
He'll never see me.

08:02.728 --> 08:04.096
Yeah, but you don't know
who you're gonna find there.

08:04.130 --> 08:05.931
For all we know,
it could be Barnes.

08:05.965 --> 08:07.199
Okay, but I can
handle myself.

08:07.233 --> 08:08.801
Sam tried to blow us all up.

08:08.835 --> 08:10.468
He will do anything
to save his ass,

08:10.503 --> 08:11.970
including killing you.

08:12.005 --> 08:13.238
At least take Vincent.

08:13.273 --> 08:15.240
Vincent?
Yes, Vincent.

08:15.275 --> 08:16.775
He will protect you
if anything goes wrong.

08:16.809 --> 08:18.042
Plus, he knows that
hospital inside-out.

08:18.076 --> 08:19.744
Didn't he do his
residency there?

08:21.980 --> 08:24.749
Look, he is in our lives,
and he is not going anywhere.

08:24.784 --> 08:26.951
So unless you tell me
I have something to worry about,

08:26.985 --> 08:29.220
I won't.

08:38.663 --> 08:41.164
I gotta admit, I was a little
surprised that you called.

08:41.200 --> 08:42.633
It was
Gabe's idea.

08:42.667 --> 08:43.967
Really?
Yeah.

08:44.001 --> 08:45.402
All he cares about
is nailing Sam...

08:45.403 --> 08:46.938
which is all I
care about, too.

08:46.972 --> 08:48.306
Copy that.

08:48.340 --> 08:49.973
Look, don't go through
Admitting, okay?

08:50.007 --> 08:51.375
Too much red tape.

08:51.409 --> 08:53.210
Just flash your badge
at an E.R. nurse,

08:53.244 --> 08:55.111
and they'll let you through.
They're used to cops.

08:55.146 --> 08:56.547
Must feel like
old times here.

08:56.581 --> 08:59.049
Actually, it feels like
a whole lifetime ago.

08:59.083 --> 09:00.984
This one's stable,
but we got more inbound.

09:01.018 --> 09:02.252
Hey, guys, let's go.

09:04.589 --> 09:06.189
Unbelievable.

09:06.224 --> 09:07.423
What's the matter?
Unbelievable.

09:07.458 --> 09:08.691
Hey, buddy,
you okay?

09:08.726 --> 09:10.227
My stomach hurts.

09:10.261 --> 09:12.395
Okay, show me where.
Around here.

09:12.429 --> 09:14.130
Okay, just take
a deep breath in.

09:14.165 --> 09:15.565
Here?

09:15.599 --> 09:17.267
Okay, okay.

09:17.301 --> 09:18.634
You're gonna be fine,
hang in there, okay?

09:18.669 --> 09:20.203
What are you doing?

09:20.238 --> 09:21.905
He's not stable at all.

09:24.608 --> 09:26.208
Hey, orderly,
come here.

09:26.243 --> 09:27.610
Get this kid to the O.R.,
stat, okay?

09:27.644 --> 09:29.111
Here.

09:30.013 --> 09:31.514
Thanks, Doc.
Yeah, quickly.

09:36.587 --> 09:37.787
What?

09:37.821 --> 09:40.789
It's nice seeing the old you.

09:42.328 --> 09:46.328

09:54.719 --> 09:55.694
Hey, how's that
kid doing?

09:55.695 --> 09:56.931
The one with the
internal bleeding?

09:56.932 --> 09:57.846
Oh, right, sorry.

09:57.847 --> 09:59.887
Yeah, he had a burst spleen,
caught it just in time.

10:01.461 --> 10:03.562
Good call, Doc.

10:07.634 --> 10:10.103
Bad news, I couldn't get
into quarantine.

10:10.137 --> 10:12.071
You okay?

10:12.106 --> 10:13.806
Yeah, actually,
I am. Uh...

10:13.841 --> 10:15.074
Sorry, what were
you saying?

10:15.109 --> 10:16.308
Okay, so I got
the nurse

10:16.343 --> 10:17.576
to give me the
patient's name,

10:17.611 --> 10:18.851
Jacob Sutter,
but not much else.

10:18.878 --> 10:20.312
She said CDC's
taking over the case,

10:20.347 --> 10:21.787
that they're putting
him in lockdown.

10:21.814 --> 10:24.082
CDC is?
Well, what disease?

10:24.117 --> 10:26.151
They don't know.
Designer drug, maybe,

10:26.185 --> 10:27.519
but none of the
symptoms match

10:27.554 --> 10:29.121
anything they've
ever seen before.

10:29.155 --> 10:30.856
High fever, memory loss,
psychotic rage.

10:30.890 --> 10:32.157
Okay, wait, wait,
wait, slow down.

10:32.191 --> 10:33.658
What does this got
to do with Sam?

10:33.692 --> 10:36.261
I don't know, but I'll bet it
has something to do with

10:36.295 --> 10:38.296
the fact that he's the second
patient named Jacob Sutter

10:38.330 --> 10:40.932
to have been afflicted.
Two days ago, a man--

10:40.967 --> 10:42.801
same name, same age--
was admitted

10:42.835 --> 10:45.603
to Hudson University Hospital,
similar symptoms, but he died.

10:45.638 --> 10:46.872
He died?

10:48.207 --> 10:50.675
So, what, you think
Sam is injecting them

10:50.709 --> 10:52.042
with the serum that JT made?

10:52.077 --> 10:53.344
Well, if he is,

10:53.379 --> 10:54.979
why people with the same name?

10:55.013 --> 10:57.373
And why isn't it working? Why
haven't they turn into beasts?

10:58.717 --> 11:00.184
Vincent Keller.

11:00.218 --> 11:02.186
I can't tell you how happy I was

11:02.220 --> 11:03.854
when I found out
you were still alive.

11:03.889 --> 11:06.290
It's good to see you, Doctor.
You, too.

11:06.324 --> 11:08.458
Doctor, this is Catherine,
Catherine, Dr. Markus.

11:08.493 --> 11:11.528
He was the attending here
when I was a resident.

11:11.562 --> 11:12.863
Oh, it's nice to meet you.

11:12.898 --> 11:14.131
You, too.

11:14.166 --> 11:15.966
So, what brings you here?

11:16.001 --> 11:17.802
You looking to get back
into it, I hope?

11:17.836 --> 11:20.771
Your boyfriend was one
of the most gifted doctors

11:20.806 --> 11:23.139
I had the great
pleasure of mentoring.

11:23.174 --> 11:25.909
Oh, uh, no, no, we're not,
we're not together.

11:25.943 --> 11:28.044
We're just friends.

11:28.078 --> 11:30.280
Oh, well, I'm sorry I assumed.

11:32.116 --> 11:33.817
And I am late for rounds.

11:33.851 --> 11:35.218
So, you, don't be a stranger.

11:35.252 --> 11:37.020
Let's catch up.
Absolutely.

11:37.054 --> 11:38.054
Catherine.

11:39.756 --> 11:42.458
Wow. You know,

11:42.492 --> 11:44.393
this actually
used to be my life.

11:44.428 --> 11:46.623
Why didn't you ask him
to get us into quarantine?

11:46.648 --> 11:47.964
On what grounds?

11:47.965 --> 11:49.565
He's not gonna
risk getting in trouble

11:49.599 --> 11:51.634
with the CDC
just to try and sneak us in.

11:51.668 --> 11:53.636
Okay, well, you have
to find out another way

11:53.670 --> 11:56.405
'cause we have to figure out how
Sam's connected to all this

11:56.440 --> 11:58.974
before the other
Jacob Sutter dies.

11:59.008 --> 12:02.144
<i>I knew Jacob Sutter's name</i>
<i>sounded familiar.</i>

12:02.178 --> 12:03.979
You knew him from the orphanage?

12:04.013 --> 12:06.415
Yeah, although I don't know
if he was one of the kids

12:06.450 --> 12:07.483
Muirfield experimented on

12:07.517 --> 12:09.418
before your mom got us
all out of there.

12:09.453 --> 12:11.821
So, you think that Sam is going
around trying

12:11.855 --> 12:13.416
to find that Jacob Sutter,
specifically?

12:13.422 --> 12:15.423
Maybe. It makes sense.
After all,

12:15.458 --> 12:18.593
he knew about the orphanage.
That's how he tried to frame me.

12:18.627 --> 12:20.229
Though,
he obviously doesn't know

12:20.263 --> 12:21.663
which Jacob he's looking for.

12:21.697 --> 12:24.266
Okay, so he's going around
injecting every Jacob Sutter

12:24.300 --> 12:25.934
he can find until
he finds the right one?

12:25.969 --> 12:27.569
One that he can turn
into a beast.

12:27.603 --> 12:28.737
A beast?

12:28.771 --> 12:30.338
Why else would he have forced JT

12:30.373 --> 12:31.840
to make the serum?

12:31.874 --> 12:33.715
And if Sam's injected two other
people already,

12:33.743 --> 12:35.076
what else could he want?

12:35.110 --> 12:36.411
But why does he need to have
somebody

12:36.445 --> 12:37.725
from the orphanage specifically?

12:37.747 --> 12:39.046
Why can't he just inject
anybody?

12:39.081 --> 12:40.515
I don't know.

12:40.549 --> 12:42.617
Obviously, Muirfield had
their selection process.

12:42.651 --> 12:44.118
We were all handpicked,

12:44.152 --> 12:46.187
but I don't know why.

12:46.221 --> 12:47.688
I know somebody who might.

12:59.200 --> 13:01.173
Excuse me, Jacob Sutter?

13:02.169 --> 13:03.670
Yeah?

13:03.705 --> 13:06.540
Sam Landon, Local 127.
The union sent me down.

13:06.574 --> 13:08.711
I guess there's been
a couple grievances.

13:08.712 --> 13:10.017
Got a minute?

13:10.720 --> 13:11.950
Sure.

13:24.619 --> 13:26.987
Doctor.

13:48.987 --> 13:50.320
How's he doing in there?

13:50.321 --> 13:51.455
Worse.

13:51.489 --> 13:53.457
You one of Jacob's doctors?

13:53.491 --> 13:55.859
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

13:55.893 --> 13:57.327
Can you help him?

13:57.361 --> 14:00.430
Ma'am, we are doing everything
we can, believe me.

14:01.863 --> 14:04.195
Do you have any idea how
this may have happened to him?

14:04.501 --> 14:06.069
No, I don't.

14:06.103 --> 14:08.904
He just... went
to meet somebody,

14:08.939 --> 14:11.274
then they found him on
the streets later all crazy like.

14:11.308 --> 14:13.776
He's confused, raged.

14:13.810 --> 14:16.579
He doesn't even know who I am
or who the kids are!

14:16.613 --> 14:18.213
Look, I know
this is very frightening,

14:18.247 --> 14:20.415
but he is in very good hands,
okay? The best.

14:20.450 --> 14:22.585
You know, why don't you go for a walk?
Get some fresh air.

14:22.619 --> 14:24.920
Let us take care of him here
so you can be ready

14:24.955 --> 14:26.889
to take care of him
when he gets back home, okay?

14:26.923 --> 14:28.891
Bless you, Doctor...?

14:28.925 --> 14:30.292
Keller.

14:30.326 --> 14:32.094
Dr. Keller.

14:50.513 --> 14:53.781
<i>What do you mean someone's</i>
<i>trying to make a beast?!</i>

14:53.816 --> 14:55.082
Do you mind keeping
your voice down?

14:55.117 --> 14:56.450
I'd rather not get
locked up, too.

14:56.485 --> 14:58.786
I'm sorry.
The last thing I ever want

14:58.821 --> 15:01.389
to do is hurt you.
You know that.

15:01.423 --> 15:03.857
Okay, I'm not here for us, Dad.

15:03.892 --> 15:06.427
I'm here because you know
everything that Muirfield did.

15:07.929 --> 15:10.364
I'm in here...

15:10.399 --> 15:11.665
I took the bullet

15:11.699 --> 15:13.367
so you could be free
of beasts.

15:13.402 --> 15:15.269
I'm not interested...

15:15.303 --> 15:17.571
No, you are in there
because you deserve to be!

15:17.605 --> 15:19.106
Because you helped create
Muirfield.

15:19.141 --> 15:21.408
And then you took the
law into your own hands

15:21.442 --> 15:23.544
and you hurt innocent people.

15:24.879 --> 15:26.947
Including you.

15:26.981 --> 15:31.351
Okay. Do you or do you not know
how they selected people

15:31.385 --> 15:32.920
to be experimented on?

15:32.954 --> 15:36.389
That was your mom's job,
she was the scientist.

15:36.424 --> 15:39.292
Apparently,
there's a certain gene

15:39.326 --> 15:42.395
that a small percentage
of the population had...

15:42.430 --> 15:44.364
have.

15:44.398 --> 15:47.534
It makes them predisposed
to becoming beasts.

15:47.568 --> 15:50.437
That's how they chose the kids
for the orphanage.

15:50.471 --> 15:51.971
They all had that gene.

15:52.005 --> 15:53.906
Yeah. Except, not all of them
got the serum.

15:53.941 --> 15:55.575
Because as soon as your mom
found out

15:55.609 --> 15:57.289
what Muirfield
was really up to, she helped

15:57.310 --> 15:59.111
the rest of those kids escape.
Right, like Gabe.

15:59.145 --> 16:00.947
Except he was already injected.

16:00.981 --> 16:03.382
Which is why he became... one.

16:03.416 --> 16:05.952
And now Sam's trying
to create another one.

16:05.986 --> 16:09.021
Okay, so what happens
if somebody gets injected

16:09.056 --> 16:10.622
but they don't have the gene?

16:10.656 --> 16:12.357
It overwhelms
the nervous system.

16:12.392 --> 16:14.659
They'll die.

16:16.596 --> 16:18.530
Is that what's happening
out there?

16:18.565 --> 16:20.399
Not for long if I can help it.

16:20.433 --> 16:21.900
Hold on. Wait.

16:21.934 --> 16:24.035
Listen, Catherine, you've got
to stop this, finish this

16:24.070 --> 16:26.337
once and for all, or you're
never gonna have a life,

16:26.371 --> 16:27.405
this Vincent, everything.

16:27.439 --> 16:29.140
What are you talking about?

16:29.174 --> 16:30.909
Because if you don't,
it will consume you

16:30.943 --> 16:33.712
the way it consumed me
and your great aunt...

16:33.746 --> 16:35.680
That is crazy.

16:35.715 --> 16:39.250
No, it's not! I tried to save you
from it, to spare you,

16:39.284 --> 16:40.551
but I can't now.

16:40.586 --> 16:42.386
You gotta do it on your own.

16:42.421 --> 16:46.157
You gotta kill the beasts
before they kill you.

16:46.191 --> 16:47.492
Especially Vincent.

16:47.526 --> 16:48.792
Okay, guard!

16:48.827 --> 16:50.461
Wait! Listen,
don't let him fool you.

16:50.496 --> 16:53.598
He is not gonna get better.
They only get worse,

16:53.632 --> 16:55.133
and only you can stop him!

17:03.908 --> 17:06.309
Sam went up
with some construction worker,

17:06.344 --> 17:08.310
but no one came out.
Where'd he go?

17:08.346 --> 17:11.015
I don't know, but I thought
I'd stay here and call you.

17:11.049 --> 17:12.516
You think he found
another Jacob Sutter?

17:12.550 --> 17:13.717
God, I hope not.

17:16.287 --> 17:17.654
You okay?

17:17.688 --> 17:19.388
You mean other
than the fact

17:19.423 --> 17:21.723
that my father says
I have to kill Vincent?

17:21.759 --> 17:23.560
What?
Never mind. It's stupid.

17:36.239 --> 17:37.740
Sir, are you okay?

17:57.629 --> 18:00.096
Sorry, I'm almost done.

18:01.965 --> 18:03.755
You know, you're lucky
it wasn't worse.

18:03.756 --> 18:06.056
I didn't know what to do.
I couldn't just shoot him.

18:06.091 --> 18:09.860
Ah. I'm just upset because
I'm stuck in here hiding

18:09.895 --> 18:11.228
while you're out
there fighting beasts.

18:11.263 --> 18:12.863
We didn't know
that was Sam's plan

18:12.898 --> 18:15.296
when we came up with the idea
to make him think you're dead.

18:15.297 --> 18:16.964
Yeah, but I should have
figured it out.

18:16.999 --> 18:19.366
I mean, getting JT
to make the serum,

18:19.401 --> 18:21.368
experimenting on Muirfield
orphans to figure out how

18:21.403 --> 18:22.803
to turn one into a beast?

18:22.838 --> 18:24.204
Well, he finally found one.

18:24.239 --> 18:26.974
The question is, what does Sam
want a beast for? I mean,

18:27.009 --> 18:28.776
after all, he's gone
to a lot of trouble

18:28.810 --> 18:30.210
to make one.
It took him years.

18:30.245 --> 18:31.646
We might find the answer to that

18:31.680 --> 18:33.947
if we can find
the elusive Mr. Barnes.

18:33.981 --> 18:37.951
I've been trying to follow his
money trail, which is extensive.

18:37.985 --> 18:40.387
I mean, this guy bought
lab equipment, cars,

18:40.422 --> 18:42.923
stayed at luxury hotels,
but no actual sign of Barnes.

18:42.957 --> 18:45.159
I've never seen
anything like it,

18:45.193 --> 18:46.626
especially in this
day and age.

18:46.661 --> 18:47.894
He's obviously doing
everything he can

18:47.929 --> 18:48.929
to conceal his identity.

18:48.963 --> 18:50.830
Which brings us back to Sam.

18:50.865 --> 18:52.298
We have to find him,
stop him

18:52.332 --> 18:55.401
from doing whatever
it is he's about to do.

18:55.436 --> 18:57.370
I thought Tess was looking for Sam?
She is,

18:57.404 --> 18:59.739
but it'll be faster
to track his new beast to him.

18:59.774 --> 19:01.575
You mean, have Vincent
track his beast.

19:01.609 --> 19:03.810
I'm coming with you.
Gabe, you can't.

19:03.844 --> 19:05.045
The hell I can't.

19:05.079 --> 19:06.712
I'm not risking you
getting hurt again.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.514
No, you have the gene,
you're predisposed, which means

19:08.549 --> 19:10.749
this isn't just about Sam
figuring out you're still alive.

19:10.784 --> 19:12.851
It's about him turning
you back into a beast.

19:12.886 --> 19:15.721
You really want
to risk that?

19:29.535 --> 19:32.437
You know, it's one thing
to be an actual doctor

19:32.472 --> 19:34.406
and take patient's blood,
it's another thing to pretend

19:34.440 --> 19:35.908
to be one and steal it.

19:35.942 --> 19:38.077
I believe, in New York,
that's called a felony.

19:38.111 --> 19:39.411
Yeah, and so is
murder, okay?

19:39.445 --> 19:40.878
So keep looking
for an antidote.

19:40.913 --> 19:43.515
We gotta figure out a way
to save this guy's life.

19:43.549 --> 19:45.383
And considering how fast
the other Jacob died,

19:45.418 --> 19:47.119
I don't think
I got much time left.

19:47.153 --> 19:50.122
"I"? I mean, you're taking this
awfully personally.

19:50.156 --> 19:52.056
I mean, it's not like
it's your fault.

19:52.091 --> 19:54.926
Yeah, well, it's not about that,
okay? It's just...

19:54.960 --> 19:56.594
I don't know, you know?

19:56.629 --> 19:59.396
Remembering what I used to do,
being an actual doctor

19:59.431 --> 20:01.799
and remembering
what that felt like, you know?

20:01.834 --> 20:04.194
Maybe your human side's coming
back faster than you thought.

20:05.437 --> 20:07.972
Anyway, this Jacob's definitely
been injected

20:08.007 --> 20:10.441
with the serum I made.
I recognize the markers.

20:10.475 --> 20:13.310
Okay, so why is it not
turning him into a beast?

20:13.345 --> 20:15.112
Why-Why is it killing him
instead?

20:15.147 --> 20:18.048
I don't know, but an antidote
might work precisely

20:18.082 --> 20:19.316
because he's not a beast.

20:19.351 --> 20:21.885
Although I have
no idea why he's not.

20:21.919 --> 20:23.920
It's because
he's not predisposed.

20:23.955 --> 20:26.290
Unlike you obviously were,
and Gabe.

20:26.324 --> 20:27.791
That's what Sam's
been searching for,

20:27.825 --> 20:29.459
others who are
predisposed.

20:29.493 --> 20:31.561
He finally found
the Jacob Sutter he wanted.

20:31.595 --> 20:33.329
Wait-- you mean,
he's made a beast?

20:33.364 --> 20:35.666
Are you sure?
Yeah, I'm positive.

20:35.700 --> 20:38.969
What, did he attack you?
Let me take a look.

20:39.003 --> 20:40.236
No, it's okay. I'm okay.

20:40.271 --> 20:42.072
The point is
he got away,

20:42.106 --> 20:45.775
and you are the only person
who can track him to Sam.

20:45.809 --> 20:48.110
Is that a problem?

20:48.145 --> 20:51.147
No. No, not at all.

20:51.182 --> 20:52.515
We're trying to
figure out how

20:52.550 --> 20:53.816
to save this other
Jacob Sutter.

20:53.850 --> 20:55.851
You know, the one who's actually
in a hospital.

20:55.886 --> 20:57.687
Leave that to the real doctors.

20:57.721 --> 21:00.089
Vincent, Sam has a beast.

21:00.123 --> 21:02.591
And whatever he wants
him for, it's bad.

21:02.625 --> 21:03.926
And it will undoubtedly
cost people lives,

21:03.960 --> 21:05.194
and you're the only one

21:05.228 --> 21:06.595
who can stop him.

21:06.629 --> 21:08.197
Okay, okay, yeah,
I'll do it, okay.

21:08.231 --> 21:10.900
So much for beast cold turkey.

21:12.535 --> 21:15.304
Just find the antidote, okay?

21:17.407 --> 21:19.174
It's hard to be Doctor Jekyll

21:19.209 --> 21:20.909
when everybody keeps wanting
Mr. Hyde.

21:27.817 --> 21:30.631
Hello! Can anyone
hear me?!

21:31.887 --> 21:33.354
Oh, thank God.

21:33.388 --> 21:36.758
Hey, can you get me
out of here, please?

21:36.792 --> 21:39.960
You don't remember, do you?

21:39.994 --> 21:41.368
Anything?

21:41.479 --> 21:43.348
A little something extra
I put in the serum.

21:44.399 --> 21:46.133
Now, unfortunately,
you attacked a woman

21:46.167 --> 21:49.437
whose boyfriend undoubtedly will
come looking for revenge.

21:49.471 --> 21:51.439
Unfortunate,
because it delays

21:51.473 --> 21:53.708
what I really need you for.

21:53.742 --> 21:55.542
However, bright side?

21:55.576 --> 21:57.711
We'll see
if you can handle him.

21:57.746 --> 22:00.114
I don't know who you are
or what you did to me,

22:00.148 --> 22:03.050
but you can't make me do
anything I don't want to do.

22:03.084 --> 22:06.180
Trust me, you won't have
a choice. When Vincent attacks,

22:06.181 --> 22:08.756
your animal...
beastly instincts

22:08.757 --> 22:11.291
will take over and
you'll fight back.

22:11.325 --> 22:14.827
And, considering
how potent the serum is,

22:14.862 --> 22:17.864
hopefully, you'll kick his ass.

22:17.898 --> 22:20.066
Come on!

23:00.339 --> 23:01.506
Jacob?

23:01.540 --> 23:03.741
Jacob, listen
to me, man.

23:03.776 --> 23:06.978
I'm not here to hurt you, okay?
I'm here to help.

23:08.881 --> 23:10.849
Jacob, wait.

23:10.883 --> 23:13.852
Don't let this thing take over
you, man, okay?

23:13.886 --> 23:17.755
I know what you're going
through, trust me.

23:17.790 --> 23:20.491
But I promise you,
you can fight this.

23:20.526 --> 23:22.393
Easy.

23:23.729 --> 23:25.296
Easy.

24:09.340 --> 24:11.374
Did you finish him off?

24:17.014 --> 24:18.248
Let's go.

24:28.143 --> 24:29.359
Detective Vargas.

24:29.360 --> 24:31.328
Hey, it's me.
Any leads on Sam?

24:31.362 --> 24:33.230
No, nothing.
The guy's super slippery.

24:33.264 --> 24:34.564
Any word from Vincent?

24:34.598 --> 24:35.732
No, not yet.

24:35.766 --> 24:37.033
You worried?

24:37.068 --> 24:40.970
Just let me know
when you find Sam.

24:45.676 --> 24:47.109
How's that antidote
coming along?

24:47.143 --> 24:48.644
Where you been?
I was getting worried.

24:48.679 --> 24:50.613
Did you find Sam's Jacob?

24:50.647 --> 24:52.448
Yeah, yeah, I found him.

24:52.483 --> 24:54.316
So, what happened?
Did you stop him?

24:54.351 --> 24:55.784
Where is he?

24:55.818 --> 24:57.887
Uh, he-he got away.

24:57.921 --> 24:59.889
He got away? How?

24:59.923 --> 25:01.390
How? I don't know how, man.

25:01.424 --> 25:04.059
He was a hell of a lot stronger
than I thought he'd be.

25:04.094 --> 25:05.627
Whatever you put
in that damn serum.

25:05.661 --> 25:09.398
Tori's blood. Still, you should've
easily been able

25:09.432 --> 25:11.633
to stop him, so what
really happened?

25:11.667 --> 25:12.834
I hesitated.

25:12.869 --> 25:15.136
I tried talking to him,
helping him out,

25:15.170 --> 25:17.305
and he caught me off guard.

25:17.339 --> 25:21.309
Bad time to try and get in touch
with your human side. Hey, look,

25:21.612 --> 25:24.015
forget it, shake it off.

25:24.016 --> 25:25.517
Even Rocky lost
to Clubber Lang

25:25.552 --> 25:27.118
the first time
they fought.

25:27.778 --> 25:31.882
Next time you'll be ready and
you'll take him down, bam!

25:32.024 --> 25:33.992
I don't think so.

25:34.026 --> 25:35.327
Why not?
Why not?

25:35.361 --> 25:37.495
Because I can't keep
juggling this line

25:37.529 --> 25:39.164
between beast and man.

25:39.198 --> 25:40.866
It's just,
it's too confusing.

25:40.900 --> 25:42.767
Come on. I gotta choose one
or the other.

25:42.801 --> 25:44.836
Especially if I ever hope
to get Catherine back.

25:44.871 --> 25:46.704
But you can't just quit.

25:46.739 --> 25:49.006
Yeah, I can.
Who says I can't, man?

25:49.040 --> 25:51.509
I want my life back,
my old life back.

25:51.543 --> 25:52.677
But Sam's got a beast,

25:52.711 --> 25:54.245
and you're only one
who can stop him.

25:54.279 --> 25:55.847
By how, by killing the guy?
Come on.

25:55.881 --> 25:58.883
Jacob isn't just beast, okay,
he's human, too, you know?

25:58.917 --> 26:01.085
That sounds more like Cat
talking than you.

26:01.119 --> 26:02.686
Well, that is
a good thing.

26:02.720 --> 26:04.721
Because it means I'm on
the right track, right?

26:04.756 --> 26:06.891
The more human I feel,
the more human I am.

26:06.925 --> 26:08.259
The less beast, the better.

26:10.996 --> 26:13.697
So is this it?

26:13.731 --> 26:16.533
Um, yeah, but I have no idea
if it'll actually work.

26:16.567 --> 26:18.068
It doesn't matter.

26:18.103 --> 26:21.070
I'd rather try saving one Jacob
than killing another.

26:21.105 --> 26:22.873
Thanks, buddy.

26:22.907 --> 26:25.709
<i>You know, it's all right</i>
<i>to worry about him.</i>

26:25.743 --> 26:29.546
Worry about who?

26:29.580 --> 26:31.715
Okay, yeah, I'm worried.

26:31.749 --> 26:34.451
Don't you think we should've
heard from Vincent by now?

26:34.485 --> 26:36.052
I think if we really want
to make this work,

26:36.086 --> 26:37.387
we have to be honest
with each other.

26:37.421 --> 26:39.588
About everything,
including Vincent.

26:39.623 --> 26:42.058
Cat, I don't expect you to
suddenly stop caring about him.

26:42.092 --> 26:44.160
You have history
together, we all do.

26:44.194 --> 26:45.895
But you can't
just keep avoiding it.

26:45.930 --> 26:47.730
I know. You're right. I'm sorry.

26:47.764 --> 26:49.232
Are you all right?

26:49.266 --> 26:51.467
'Cause ever since you came back
from visiting your father,

26:51.501 --> 26:53.502
you have been a little quiet.

26:53.537 --> 26:55.504
Did he say something
to bother you?

26:55.539 --> 26:57.172
Doesn't he always?

26:59.776 --> 27:01.343
It's JT.

27:01.377 --> 27:02.545
Where's Vincent?

27:13.189 --> 27:15.324
What the hell are
you doing in here?

27:15.358 --> 27:17.326
What is that?
Doctor...

27:17.360 --> 27:19.227
Vincent, what are you doing?
Dr. Markus, let me explain.

27:19.262 --> 27:22.230
Mrs. Sutter said a Dr. Keller
told her to go home.

27:22.265 --> 27:23.865
I'm just trying to help,
Dr. Markus.

27:23.899 --> 27:25.066
What is this?

27:25.100 --> 27:27.769
Please, Dr. Markus,
there's no time left.

27:27.803 --> 27:29.170
You're not even wearing a mask!

27:29.204 --> 27:30.872
I don't need a mask.
Just let me explain.

27:30.906 --> 27:32.340
I'm calling security.

27:32.374 --> 27:34.241
Do, and he will die.

27:34.276 --> 27:36.444
There is no time left, okay?
Please put down the phone.

27:36.479 --> 27:37.946
Please, Dr. Markus,
I cannot tell you

27:37.980 --> 27:40.414
why I know what I do,
but you know me,

27:40.449 --> 27:41.615
Dr. Markus, okay?

27:41.649 --> 27:43.717
You know that when I was
working for you,

27:43.751 --> 27:45.453
all I ever cared about
was doing

27:45.487 --> 27:47.020
absolutely everything I could

27:47.054 --> 27:48.622
to help the patient,
to save lives.

27:48.656 --> 27:51.224
Come on.
His labored breathing,

27:51.258 --> 27:54.294
his pulse is thready,
he's dying and he's dying fast.

27:54.328 --> 27:55.629
And this hospital can do nothing

27:55.663 --> 27:57.798
more for him.
You know that.

27:57.832 --> 28:00.166
This is his only chance, Doctor.
Please.

28:10.511 --> 28:13.613
This better work,
or it's both our asses.

28:15.483 --> 28:16.649
Thank you.

28:26.527 --> 28:28.027
What do you mean,
Vincent quit?

28:28.061 --> 28:29.662
How else are we
gonna stop Sam?

28:29.696 --> 28:31.531
I don't know, but apparently
he's more concerned

28:31.565 --> 28:33.499
about the innocent Jacob
than the beast one.

28:33.534 --> 28:34.850
Okay, how is that possible?
What's he thinking?

28:34.875 --> 28:35.701
Honestly,

28:35.702 --> 28:38.504
I think he's thinking about you.
Sorry?

28:38.538 --> 28:40.572
Look, I'm probably breaking
the bro code here,

28:40.606 --> 28:44.343
but since we're talking
about life and death,

28:44.377 --> 28:45.744
Vincent's trying to go straight.

28:46.879 --> 28:48.347
Beast straight.

28:48.381 --> 28:50.182
Why?
To win you over,

28:50.216 --> 28:51.450
to get you back.

28:51.484 --> 28:54.118
By proving he's more man
than beast.

28:54.153 --> 28:55.820
JT, that is crazy.
Is it?

28:55.855 --> 28:58.089
Isn't that why you two broke up
in the first place,

28:58.123 --> 28:59.257
because it was the reverse?

28:59.291 --> 29:01.426
Yes, but I'm with Gabe now.

29:01.460 --> 29:03.428
But only because Vincent went
beast. Look, I don't want

29:03.462 --> 29:05.496
to get in the middle of this,
but all I'm saying

29:05.531 --> 29:09.000
is with Vincent trying
to show you he's made a mistake,

29:09.035 --> 29:10.768
who knows?

29:10.802 --> 29:12.836
Maybe destiny will prevail.

29:12.871 --> 29:14.439
Yeah, if I don't kill him first.

29:15.674 --> 29:17.775
Never mind.

29:19.144 --> 29:21.045
Hi.
Hey, I think

29:21.080 --> 29:24.348
I might've found something.

29:24.383 --> 29:26.617
both. Cat, I think
they might be the same person.

29:26.651 --> 29:27.885
Think about it.

29:27.919 --> 29:30.287
Both Barnes and Sam went missing
on the same day

29:30.321 --> 29:31.455
six years ago, right?

29:31.489 --> 29:32.856
And up until Dana found Sam,

29:32.891 --> 29:34.357
she thought that Barnes
had killed him.

29:34.392 --> 29:37.194
But now that Sam's still alive,
Barnes is nowhere to be found.

29:37.228 --> 29:40.197
You think that Sam killed Barnes
instead and took his identity?

29:40.231 --> 29:41.465
Maybe.

29:41.499 --> 29:42.865
It's the only thing
that makes sense.

29:42.900 --> 29:46.636
Plus, I found a loft that Barnes
used years ago on the West Side.

29:46.670 --> 29:48.338
And there's never been
a title change,

29:48.372 --> 29:50.507
but somebody's still making
the payments, and in his name.

29:50.541 --> 29:52.142
Okay, so the whole reason
we were following Sam

29:52.176 --> 29:53.843
is in the hopes
that he would lead us to Barnes,

29:53.877 --> 29:55.212
but if they're one
in the same person...

29:55.246 --> 29:57.046
Then we need
to grab him, stop him.

29:57.081 --> 29:58.482
We may even know where
to look for him.

29:58.516 --> 30:00.549
Okay, the only problem
is that Vincent's gone MIA.

30:00.584 --> 30:02.418
What do you mean?
Long story,

30:02.452 --> 30:04.420
but the short of it is
we're on our own,

30:04.454 --> 30:06.322
and we have no way
to stop Sam's beast.

30:06.356 --> 30:07.757
Well, maybe I can.

30:07.791 --> 30:10.226
Gabe, we've already talked
about this.

30:10.260 --> 30:11.761
I'm not talking
about fighting Jacob,

30:11.795 --> 30:13.156
I'm talking about
appealing to him.

30:13.163 --> 30:15.197
Look, we're both from
the same orphanage, right?

30:15.232 --> 30:16.999
That means we know
each other, okay?

30:17.033 --> 30:18.400
I know what he's been through,
what he's going through.

30:18.435 --> 30:19.735
He's not gonna hurt me.

30:19.769 --> 30:21.670
But Sam will
if he catches you.

30:21.704 --> 30:24.706
You are just
as predisposed as...

30:24.741 --> 30:26.509
He won't catch me.
I'll be careful.

30:26.543 --> 30:28.010
Look, Catherine, I am done

30:28.044 --> 30:29.311
sitting on the sidelines.

30:29.346 --> 30:30.846
This is too important.
Gabe, wait.

30:30.880 --> 30:33.649
If I can save Jacob,
then we can finally nail Sam.

30:35.184 --> 30:37.552
What's going on?

30:37.586 --> 30:40.789
What's going on is that
everything's falling apart.

30:42.258 --> 30:43.391
Time for a Hail Mary.

30:52.801 --> 30:54.269
Hmm?

30:55.003 --> 30:56.504
Who is this?

30:56.539 --> 30:58.239
Not your dead wife if that's
what you're wondering.

30:58.274 --> 30:59.907
And by the way,
she's not really dead.

30:59.941 --> 31:01.008
Detective Chandler.

31:01.043 --> 31:02.443
I'm done playing games, Sam.

31:02.478 --> 31:04.345
We're onto you.
We know you killed Tony Barnes

31:04.380 --> 31:05.946
just like you thought
you killed your wife.

31:05.981 --> 31:07.281
I don't understand.
Dana's alive?

31:07.315 --> 31:08.615
You're not the only one

31:08.650 --> 31:10.450
who knows how to play dead.

31:10.485 --> 31:11.585
I don't believe you.

31:11.619 --> 31:12.853
How else do you think
I got her phone?

31:12.888 --> 31:14.789
Do yourself a favor, Sam,

31:14.823 --> 31:16.090
turn yourself in
before it's too late.

31:16.124 --> 31:17.223
It's already too late.

31:17.248 --> 31:19.459
For 6 years, I've been trying
to get revenge for my son.

31:19.528 --> 31:20.728
I'm not going to stop now.

31:21.362 --> 31:23.297
So that's what this is about,
your son?

31:23.331 --> 31:24.764
Isn't that enough?

31:24.799 --> 31:26.500
It won't bring him back.

31:26.534 --> 31:29.603
At least the people who did this
to him will finally pay.

31:29.637 --> 31:31.037
Well, you'll never
get away with it.

31:32.674 --> 31:34.741
Lowan?

31:38.913 --> 31:40.073
What was that? What happened?

31:40.081 --> 31:41.047
Looks like my wife's

31:41.082 --> 31:42.048
not the only one still alive.

31:42.083 --> 31:43.850
No!

31:43.884 --> 31:44.951
Gabe!

31:44.985 --> 31:46.252
Gabe!

31:53.149 --> 31:55.182
He's going to make it.

32:02.958 --> 32:04.892
Okay, talk to me.

32:04.926 --> 32:08.228
I think Mr. Sutter
is going to make it, Vincent.

32:08.263 --> 32:10.264
I don't know how,
or why,

32:10.298 --> 32:12.866
but... he's definitely
improving.

32:12.900 --> 32:14.968
Thank God.

32:15.002 --> 32:17.437
CDC's going to want to
open an investigation.

32:17.472 --> 32:20.707
They will need to know
how he survived

32:20.741 --> 32:22.309
and what this hospital did,

32:22.343 --> 32:24.578
exactly.

32:24.612 --> 32:26.780
And what are you going to say?

32:26.814 --> 32:30.216
Well...

32:30.250 --> 32:32.218
wouldn't be the first
unexplained medical miracle

32:32.252 --> 32:34.154
we've ever seen, right?

32:36.157 --> 32:37.390
No.

32:37.424 --> 32:38.624
Thank you.

32:38.659 --> 32:40.727
Look, Dr. Markus,

32:40.761 --> 32:42.595
I'm sorry I got
you involved.

32:42.629 --> 32:45.498
Involved in what?

32:45.532 --> 32:48.067
You saved a man's life, Vincent.

32:48.101 --> 32:50.836
That's all
that matters...

32:50.870 --> 32:53.306
especially to you,
I'm gathering.

32:53.340 --> 32:57.343
I don't know if you're trying
to make amends for something...

32:59.913 --> 33:02.280
...but that's the way to do it.

33:08.521 --> 33:10.823
Vincent.

33:10.857 --> 33:12.424
What are you doing here?

33:12.458 --> 33:14.659
Sam has Gabe.
How?

33:14.694 --> 33:16.695
He went after Beast-Jacob,
hoping to...

33:16.729 --> 33:19.163
Look, the point is
with Gabe being predisposed...

33:19.198 --> 33:21.733
Sam can turn Gabe
back into a beast.

33:21.767 --> 33:22.734
Exactly.

33:22.768 --> 33:23.935
Listen,
JT told me

33:23.969 --> 33:25.537
about what you're
trying to do.

33:25.571 --> 33:28.172
How you're trying
to redeem yourself for me.

33:28.207 --> 33:29.774
That guy's got a big mouth.

33:29.808 --> 33:30.775
And I
appreciate that,

33:30.809 --> 33:32.444
I really do,

33:32.478 --> 33:34.078
and I know that it isn't fair
for me to ask you

33:34.113 --> 33:35.512
to do this,
but if you don't help Gabe...

33:35.547 --> 33:37.215
Where is he? Come on.

33:42.721 --> 33:44.622
You gotta believe me,

33:44.656 --> 33:47.358
I never wanted it
to come to this.

33:47.392 --> 33:48.793
I'm not a madman,

33:48.827 --> 33:50.594
- I just want...
- Justice?

33:50.629 --> 33:52.162
I can get you justice,

33:52.196 --> 33:53.597
for your son,
for everything that's happened.

33:53.632 --> 33:54.665
No, you can't.

33:54.699 --> 33:56.533
No one can.

33:56.568 --> 33:58.535
The people who took
my son's life...

33:58.570 --> 34:00.137
they're too powerful.

34:00.171 --> 34:01.472
This is the only way.

34:01.506 --> 34:02.706
Who?

34:02.741 --> 34:03.974
Who are you talking about?

34:04.008 --> 34:05.342
Let me help you.

34:05.377 --> 34:07.210
You're going to.
By keeping your friends

34:07.245 --> 34:08.710
away from me while
Jacob helps me

34:08.746 --> 34:10.179
finish what
I started.

34:10.214 --> 34:12.181
The good news,
for what it's worth...

34:12.215 --> 34:14.349
you won't remember
what you're about to become,

34:14.384 --> 34:15.550
what you're
about to do.

34:15.585 --> 34:16.786
Please, don't do
this to me.

34:22.159 --> 34:23.859
I'm begging you, okay?
I don't want to...

34:23.893 --> 34:25.333
I don't want to become
a beast again,

34:25.360 --> 34:26.561
I don't want to
go back there.

34:26.596 --> 34:27.562
I know.

34:31.233 --> 34:33.302
No, please.

34:33.335 --> 34:34.670
I'm sorry.

34:34.704 --> 34:36.638
Forgive me.

34:48.851 --> 34:51.786
Jacob!
Inject him!

34:57.592 --> 34:58.626
Get Sam! Hurry!

35:09.504 --> 35:12.139
Catherine!

35:30.791 --> 35:31.791
Vincent.

35:33.294 --> 35:35.261
Vincent!

35:56.649 --> 35:58.150
Are you okay?

36:04.594 --> 36:06.060
Still no sign of Sam, huh?

36:06.095 --> 36:07.329
No, he got
away again.

36:07.363 --> 36:08.562
Can you
sense him?

36:08.597 --> 36:09.897
No.

36:09.932 --> 36:12.233
He's a hard man
to track, you know?

36:12.267 --> 36:14.401
Don't worry,
we'll find him.

36:14.436 --> 36:16.570
Yeah, before or after

36:16.605 --> 36:17.905
he completes his
revenge mission?

36:17.940 --> 36:19.420
Well, at least he
doesn't have a beast

36:19.441 --> 36:21.408
to help him
out any more.

36:21.443 --> 36:23.577
Come on, you had
no choice, okay?

36:23.612 --> 36:25.579
You had to shoot him
to save Gabe.

36:25.614 --> 36:27.148
Yeah.

36:27.182 --> 36:28.949
That's not what's bothering me.

36:28.983 --> 36:31.752
I didn't even hesitate,
I just pulled the trigger.

36:31.786 --> 36:34.321
Well, it's not like you haven't
shot a beast before, all right?

36:34.356 --> 36:36.157
Yeah, but it's
the first time

36:36.191 --> 36:37.491
that it didn't
even cross my mind

36:37.526 --> 36:38.847
that I was shooting
a person, too.

36:40.228 --> 36:41.561
What?

36:41.595 --> 36:43.396
For the first time, yesterday,

36:43.430 --> 36:46.166
I hesitated, too.

36:46.200 --> 36:47.901
I got my ass kicked,

36:47.935 --> 36:49.936
but I... I couldn't stop
thinking about

36:49.971 --> 36:51.171
Jacob,
the person.

36:51.205 --> 36:52.505
I don't know, I guess

36:52.540 --> 36:54.107
it's a fine balance
to work out, huh?

36:54.142 --> 36:56.076
At least you're still trying.

36:56.110 --> 36:58.077
Well, I'm glad
you're still noticing.

37:00.714 --> 37:01.781
Hey.

37:01.815 --> 37:02.848
Hey, are you okay?

37:02.883 --> 37:04.417
Still human...

37:04.451 --> 37:05.618
thanks to you.

37:07.154 --> 37:08.354
Guess I should've
stayed dead

37:08.389 --> 37:09.355
a little
longer, huh?

37:09.390 --> 37:12.992
No, no, not... not at all.

37:13.026 --> 37:15.194
Everything seemed
to work out just fine.

37:15.228 --> 37:16.696
Except for Sam.

37:16.730 --> 37:19.498
We gotta find him before
he finds another beast.

37:26.807 --> 37:28.440
Can I help you?

37:28.474 --> 37:30.209
Xavier Wright?

37:30.243 --> 37:31.710
Yeah.

37:31.744 --> 37:33.178
From the orphanage?

37:34.314 --> 37:35.647
Do I know you?

37:55.234 --> 37:56.601
You want to talk about it?

37:58.503 --> 38:00.471
It's just you hardly said
a word the whole ride home.

38:00.505 --> 38:03.474
I guess I just feel bad,
that's all.

38:03.508 --> 38:05.909
About?

38:07.190 --> 38:09.747
It's nothing, really. I'm okay.
Hey,

38:09.748 --> 38:12.348
I thought we decided that we were
gonna be honest with each other.

38:15.655 --> 38:19.516
I...  I feel really
bad about what I did to Jacob.

38:19.625 --> 38:22.092
And about asking Vincent
to help.

38:22.127 --> 38:23.927
You didn't have much
of a choice.

38:23.962 --> 38:25.763
I know.

38:25.797 --> 38:28.498
I know, but he's been trying
so hard to redeem himself,

38:28.532 --> 38:31.401
to... become more of a man.

38:31.435 --> 38:33.904
But he's not a man, Catherine.
He's a beast.

38:35.539 --> 38:38.141
You don't really believe that.

38:38.175 --> 38:40.577
Look, do you want to know
what I believe?

38:40.611 --> 38:42.579
I believe that your relationship
with Vincent

38:42.613 --> 38:44.147
is getting in the way of ours.

38:44.181 --> 38:46.082
No, that's not true.
No?

38:46.116 --> 38:47.651
You sure about that? Be honest.

38:47.685 --> 38:49.886
Okay, so what do you want me
to do about it?

38:49.920 --> 38:51.688
Cut him out
of my life completely?

38:51.722 --> 38:55.691
Look, I'm the one who said
that we have to accept the fact

38:55.725 --> 38:57.894
that Vincent is in your life,
in our lives.

38:57.928 --> 39:00.529
But it doesn't mean I like it,
because I don't.

39:00.563 --> 39:02.493
It feels like there are three
of us in this relationship,

39:02.518 --> 39:03.599
and, sooner or later,

39:03.600 --> 39:05.501
that is gonna have
to be resolved, Catherine.

39:05.535 --> 39:07.503
Vincent has to go.

39:32.661 --> 39:33.895
We have to talk.

39:33.930 --> 39:35.563
Come on in.

39:35.597 --> 39:37.232
We have
to stop seeing each other.

39:37.266 --> 39:39.301
What?
Not...

39:39.335 --> 39:43.738
romantically, um, because
we're not romantic anymore.

39:43.772 --> 39:45.072
Um...
Okay.

39:45.106 --> 39:46.808
It's also confusing,

39:46.842 --> 39:50.445
and it's just so hard
with you still being in my life.

39:50.479 --> 39:52.380
It's not fair to me,
it's not fair to Gabe.

39:52.414 --> 39:54.114
Gabe?

39:54.149 --> 39:55.450
Okay.

39:55.484 --> 39:57.785
You know what I
think about that?

39:57.820 --> 39:59.419
I think...

39:59.454 --> 40:01.621
screw Gabe.

40:01.656 --> 40:03.030
Sorry?
Catherine, come on.

40:03.055 --> 40:05.466
We both know that you're not
supposed to be with Gabe, okay?

40:05.467 --> 40:06.843
You are supposed
to be with me.

40:06.844 --> 40:07.827
Come on. Please, no.
I'm leaving.

40:07.828 --> 40:09.795
Vincent, we tried to be together, okay?
We did everything we could

40:09.830 --> 40:11.597
and it didn't work
and it's not ever going to work.

40:11.631 --> 40:13.099
We're just not meant to be.

40:13.133 --> 40:15.068
Okay, this is your father
talking, not you.

40:15.102 --> 40:16.635
Let me go.
No. Come on.

40:16.670 --> 40:18.238
Let me go.
No, come on. I love you.

40:34.880 --> 40:36.080
You okay?
