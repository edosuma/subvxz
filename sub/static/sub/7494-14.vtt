00:01.135 --> 00:02.670
Narrator: Last time
on Make It Pop

00:02.703 --> 00:04.038
You can be my
assistant director.

00:04.072 --> 00:08.976
Sun Hi: The bands all I've got
and PopularGirl15's trashing it.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.278
Sun Hi: Whats with him?

00:10.311 --> 00:11.345
Jodi: I don't notice him because
I pay no attention to him

00:11.379 --> 00:13.547
It's Jared, he said, I
need to see you.

00:13.581 --> 00:16.350
It could be the most pivotal
moment of my life, oh.

00:16.384 --> 00:17.485
Jodi: Corki.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.753
You can't just go running like
a puppy to a pork chop

00:19.787 --> 00:21.555
every time a boy
calls for you.

00:21.589 --> 00:23.157
I don't know
much about boys,

00:23.191 --> 00:26.960
but from what I
understand they can be...

00:26.994 --> 00:28.529
What's that word for
when your feelings

00:28.562 --> 00:29.997
keep changing
back and forth?

00:30.030 --> 00:30.598
Fickle?

00:30.631 --> 00:31.165
No, no, no, no.

00:31.199 --> 00:32.166
That's a fried pickle.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.168
Just because Jared was
into you at Homecoming,

00:34.202 --> 00:35.903
doesn't mean he still is.

00:35.936 --> 00:37.971
Boys have short emotional
attention spans.

00:38.005 --> 00:39.240
Medical fact.

00:39.273 --> 00:40.908
We don't want you to get your
hopes up and then be crushed.

00:40.941 --> 00:43.511
You guys are acting as if I'm
expecting a marriage proposal!

00:43.544 --> 00:45.713
Maybe it's because you keep
walking around like this.

00:45.746 --> 00:52.019
Dun dun du da, dun dun du da,
dun dun duh da da duh da dah.

00:52.052 --> 00:54.422
Corki: I do not.

00:54.455 --> 00:56.790
I'll be fine.

00:59.093 --> 01:01.429
Do you really think
she's gonna be fine?

01:01.462 --> 01:02.430
Could go either way.

01:02.463 --> 01:04.098
But now on to
my new plan.

01:04.132 --> 01:07.935
I've been calling them
fiendish plots, but go on.

01:07.968 --> 01:13.107
Mr. Stark didn't cast me because
of a tiny "issue" with Valerie.

01:13.141 --> 01:15.509
So, now I'm going to
vlog my feelings

01:15.543 --> 01:17.145
until he sees the
error of his ways.

01:17.178 --> 01:18.412
Thoughts?

01:18.446 --> 01:20.914
Sounds like a great plan with
no possible way of going wrong.

01:20.948 --> 01:23.117
I know sarcasm
when I hear it.

01:23.151 --> 01:25.018
I'm doing it anyway.

01:29.723 --> 01:30.158
Corki!

01:30.191 --> 01:30.824
You came.

01:30.858 --> 01:33.161
Of course I
did, Jared.

01:33.194 --> 01:34.962
I need to ask you a question...

01:34.995 --> 01:36.664
Of course you
do, Jared.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.232
This isn't
easy for me.

01:38.266 --> 01:39.633
Of course it
isn't, Jared.

01:39.667 --> 01:40.301
Will you...

01:40.334 --> 01:41.535
Of course I
will, Jared!

01:41.569 --> 01:42.536
Help me with
Valerie?

01:42.570 --> 01:43.771
Of course I
do Jared--

01:43.804 --> 01:46.240
Wait. What!?

01:46.274 --> 01:47.141
She can't act.

01:47.175 --> 01:48.242
She can't sing.

01:48.276 --> 01:50.611
She can't focus on anything
but my perfect smile,

01:50.644 --> 01:55.916
square jaw, and
astonishing chin.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.084
Corki?

01:57.117 --> 01:58.519
Sorry.

01:58.552 --> 01:59.587
You were saying?

01:59.620 --> 02:01.922
She's going to ruin the
play and I need your help.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.225
I have an awkward
history with Valerie.

02:04.258 --> 02:05.025
So do I.

02:05.058 --> 02:06.494
We dated briefly.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.496
Star football player
and cheerleader,

02:08.529 --> 02:09.863
a tale older than time.

02:09.897 --> 02:11.265
Why do you
want my help?

02:11.299 --> 02:14.502
You're the smartest
person I know.

02:14.535 --> 02:15.636
Well...

02:15.669 --> 02:16.470
I'm not sure...

02:16.504 --> 02:18.506
I knew you couldn't
say no to me.

02:18.539 --> 02:20.908
There is one other
thing I have to tell you.

02:20.941 --> 02:22.576
Yes?

02:22.610 --> 02:30.751
I love yoga and I'm going
to be late for class.

02:30.784 --> 02:33.787
So I'll see you later.

02:33.821 --> 02:35.055
What?

02:37.658 --> 02:41.028
* Make it pop, woo, woo *

02:41.061 --> 02:44.832
* Make it pop, woo woo

02:44.865 --> 02:46.133
* I can't wait, no

02:46.166 --> 02:50.738
* I can't wait no, I can't
wait, no I can't wait *

02:50.771 --> 02:52.139
* So make it pop

02:52.172 --> 02:54.542

02:54.575 --> 02:57.678
* Wait till we drop,
Oh ya, we're ready to go *

02:57.711 --> 03:00.814
* Ain't gonna stop, when

03:00.848 --> 03:03.617
* We make it, you make

03:03.651 --> 03:06.153
* M-m-m-m-m-m-

03:08.088 --> 03:09.156

03:09.189 --> 03:13.026
Give it up for XOIQ!!!

03:13.060 --> 03:14.828
(cheering)

03:14.862 --> 03:17.565
* Get it right or
do it all again *

03:17.598 --> 03:20.968
* This time round I'll be
better than I used to be *

03:21.001 --> 03:23.036
* I wanna see if
I'm ready *

03:23.070 --> 03:26.607

03:26.640 --> 03:29.343

Up too late at night *

03:29.377 --> 03:34.715
* Havin too much fun
Hangin out with everyone *

03:34.748 --> 03:38.586
* S'what happens when
you're being young *

03:38.619 --> 03:41.689
* Life is but a test
I ain't failing it *

03:41.722 --> 03:46.994
* Only just begun, so tell
me what you would've done *

03:47.027 --> 03:50.598
* When the clock is
beating like a drum *

(cheering)

05:47.214 --> 05:49.383
(crowd gasps)

05:52.252 --> 05:57.324
(cheering)

05:57.958 --> 05:59.493
Jodi, are you okay?

05:59.527 --> 06:00.894
Yeah, sorry.

06:00.928 --> 06:01.695
I just wasn't watching.

06:01.729 --> 06:03.330
Because you were
looking at Caleb.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.398
What?

06:04.432 --> 06:05.733
Pft.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.067
No.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.837
Caleb who?

06:09.870 --> 06:14.808
And Caleb, you seem to be
acting peppier than usual.

06:14.842 --> 06:15.976
No.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.878
I'm acting like I always do,

06:17.911 --> 06:21.849
Slightly hyper and
fairly confused.

06:21.882 --> 06:25.052
Anyway, I should
get changed.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.319
Yeah, me too.

06:26.353 --> 06:30.090
I mean not change,
just I have got to go.

06:30.958 --> 06:33.961
Later...

06:33.994 --> 06:35.362
What was that
all about?

06:35.395 --> 06:37.898
They've both been
acting strange lately.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.332
How'd it go with Jared?

06:39.366 --> 06:40.367
Great...

06:40.400 --> 06:42.970
Yeah, really good...

06:43.003 --> 06:44.438
it went fine.

06:44.472 --> 06:46.306
An unmitigated disaster.

06:46.339 --> 06:48.809
Thanks for asking!

06:48.842 --> 06:49.977
Boys.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.178
We don't even need
them anymore.

06:51.211 --> 06:55.248
The invention of the selfie
has rendered them obsolete.

06:55.282 --> 06:59.286
(camera clicks)

07:00.253 --> 07:02.422
Ms. Hurley: In an effort to
ensure everyone maintains

07:02.456 --> 07:04.925
the mandated 3.0
grade point average,

07:04.958 --> 07:08.962
we administer periodic
grade summaries

07:08.996 --> 07:10.330
here at MacKendrick
Prep.

07:10.363 --> 07:11.799
Good work.

07:11.832 --> 07:14.835
Congratulations, Miss Chang.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.570
4.6?

07:16.604 --> 07:18.105
How is that even possible?

07:18.138 --> 07:20.007
Bonus questions.

07:20.040 --> 07:23.477
You did more work
than you had to?

07:23.511 --> 07:25.879
Ms. Hurley: Sun Hi...

07:25.913 --> 07:30.383
2.999 rounded up to three.

07:30.417 --> 07:34.187
Math... you've found
me a loophole!

07:34.221 --> 07:37.390
For those of you who have
dipped below the requisite GPA

07:37.424 --> 07:39.993
will be assigned a Senior
Study Advisor to help you.

07:40.027 --> 07:43.196
Job one at MacKendrick Prep
is to make sure you leave

07:43.230 --> 07:46.233
with more knowledge
than you arrived with.

07:46.266 --> 07:48.435
Okay Jodi, I'm going to
lower my voice here

07:48.468 --> 07:50.437
so as to not draw
attention to you.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.840
That just drew everybody's
attention to me.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.608
I'm afraid you got a 2.5.

07:54.642 --> 07:55.776
Now, everybody heard that.

07:55.809 --> 07:59.079
The good news is, I assigned
you a great study advisor.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.180
You're gonna love her.

08:00.213 --> 08:04.351
And don't worry, this
will stay our little secret.

08:07.454 --> 08:10.991
*

08:11.024 --> 08:12.425
You ready to go?

08:12.459 --> 08:14.327
I thought you'd never ask!

08:14.361 --> 08:15.428
But where?

08:15.462 --> 08:19.933
Ooh, remember when we
went to San Sebastian Pizza?

08:19.967 --> 08:22.536
Best first date ever.

08:22.570 --> 08:24.572
I meant, are you
ready to rehearse.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.006
Oh.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.274
That.

08:27.307 --> 08:28.408
Sure.

08:28.441 --> 08:30.544
I guess we can get
pizza afterwards.

08:30.578 --> 08:33.380
Okay, repeat after
me: The lips, the teeth,

08:33.413 --> 08:36.950
the tip of the tongue, the lips,
the teeth, the tip of the--

08:36.984 --> 08:38.451
Is this a kissing warm-up?

08:38.485 --> 08:39.419
It's a vocal exercise!

08:39.452 --> 08:41.421
A time-honored way of
promoting crisp and

08:41.454 --> 08:43.156
frontal consonant
placement!

08:43.190 --> 08:44.324
Uh huh.

08:44.357 --> 08:47.394
Look, if we're not going out
can we pick this up later?

08:47.427 --> 08:48.428
We just started!

08:48.461 --> 08:51.098
Believe me Jared, I
want to be here with you.

08:51.131 --> 08:53.300
But I have to go help
some kids study

08:53.333 --> 08:54.902
to show how
compassionate I am.

08:54.935 --> 08:57.004
It looks good on
college applications.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.505
Bye!

09:02.309 --> 09:09.983
*

09:10.017 --> 09:12.219
You can have him
now, but I'll be back.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.521
I want to say something
really, really witty...

09:14.554 --> 09:16.523
But I'm going to take
the higher road

09:16.556 --> 09:18.258
and spare you my
comeback...

09:18.291 --> 09:21.361
since I haven't
really thought of one.

09:21.394 --> 09:26.634
Okay.

09:26.667 --> 09:29.036
She has no
commitment to the play.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.503
Why did she
even audition?

09:30.537 --> 09:32.940
I think she wanted
to get close to me.

09:32.973 --> 09:34.675
That's weird.

09:34.708 --> 09:37.144
Well since you're here,
do you wanna run lines?

09:37.177 --> 09:39.246
I'd love to.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.448
Alright are you familiar
with vocal exercises?

09:41.481 --> 09:43.183
Who isn't?

09:43.216 --> 09:48.421
Red leather, yellow leather,
red leather, yellow leather...

09:48.455 --> 09:51.291
Despite one tiny,
little prank,

09:51.324 --> 09:54.227
that just so happened to
be hilarious

09:54.261 --> 10:00.100
the school's musical will now
be denied my awesomeness.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.301
Hey, kid!

10:01.334 --> 10:03.370
How do you feel about the
musical taking place without the

10:03.403 --> 10:07.107
best singer on campus?

10:07.140 --> 10:08.608
Speechless.

10:08.642 --> 10:12.112
My thoughts exactly.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.213
Mr. Stark!

10:13.246 --> 10:15.649
Can I talk to you about
your decision to punish me?

10:15.683 --> 10:17.250
Are you having
second thoughts yet?

10:17.284 --> 10:20.487
I told you, Sun Hi,
actions have consequences.

10:20.520 --> 10:23.423
I get that, but this particular
consequence may or may not

10:23.456 --> 10:25.058
change the
course of history!

10:25.092 --> 10:27.094
I'm leaning
towards "may not."

10:27.127 --> 10:31.098
Aren't you afraid to
deny the world my talent?

10:31.131 --> 10:33.066
I'm leaning towards
ah not really.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.334
Have you heard
Valerie sing?

10:34.367 --> 10:35.135
Of course not.

10:35.168 --> 10:37.470
Only dogs hear
notes that shrill!

10:37.504 --> 10:38.739
Leave me alone.

10:38.772 --> 10:40.674
Think of all
those poor dogs.

10:40.708 --> 10:42.642
Listening to sour notes.

10:42.676 --> 10:44.211
The dogs, Mr. Stark.

10:44.244 --> 10:45.746
Show some
compassion.

10:55.188 --> 10:56.589
Can't Corki be my
student advisor?

10:56.623 --> 10:58.391
She knows I'm a
visual learner.

10:58.425 --> 11:00.560
And I learn better while
reading fashion magazines.

11:00.593 --> 11:03.764
It's called the Senior Study
Advisor Program, Miss Mapa.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.032
You need a senior.

11:05.065 --> 11:06.533
Corki is a freshman.

11:06.566 --> 11:09.202
The MacKendrick Handbook is very
specific about these things.

11:09.236 --> 11:12.205
Ah, here's your
study advisor now.

11:12.239 --> 11:13.106
You?

11:13.140 --> 11:13.841
You?

11:13.874 --> 11:15.342
Look at you two
getting along.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.244
Fun!

11:22.615 --> 11:24.718
It's for college.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.320
*

11:27.354 --> 11:29.256
So you ready to get started?

11:29.289 --> 11:30.623
What can you teach me?

11:30.657 --> 11:31.624
The 3 R's?

11:31.658 --> 11:34.527
Rudeness, Ruining
and ARguing?

11:34.561 --> 11:37.197
I have nothing to
learn from you.

11:37.230 --> 11:38.631
Not according to
your grades.

11:38.665 --> 11:41.401
Says here you have some pretty
embarrassing scores.

11:41.434 --> 11:42.502
Hey, that's private.

11:42.535 --> 11:43.603
Don't worry.

11:43.636 --> 11:46.807
I swore everyone I
told to secrecy.

11:46.840 --> 11:51.444
Now, read chapters three
through nine in this book.

11:51.478 --> 11:53.446
How many weeks do
I get to finish?

11:53.480 --> 11:55.849
You have one seventh
of a week to finish it.

11:55.883 --> 11:58.318
I think even you
can do that math.

11:58.351 --> 11:59.519
Now lets make
this quick,

11:59.552 --> 12:03.123
my future fiancé is waiting
to take me on a pizza date.

12:03.156 --> 12:04.524
I thought you
were gluten-free.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.259
Only when it's cool.

12:07.828 --> 12:12.265
Mr. Stark, as
assistant director,

12:12.299 --> 12:14.167
I'm very protective
of this cast

12:14.201 --> 12:16.203
and would never throw
anybody under the bus.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.405
What's your issue, Jared?

12:18.438 --> 12:20.373
Valerie needs to be
fired immediately.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.108
Okay, what?

12:21.141 --> 12:22.776
She's not taking
this seriously.

12:22.810 --> 12:25.612
No one said
this would be easy.

12:25.645 --> 12:27.580
She's probably
just insecure.

12:27.614 --> 12:29.249
Most actors are.

12:29.282 --> 12:32.319
Luckily we're
not like that.

12:32.352 --> 12:33.887
What are you
staring at?

12:33.921 --> 12:37.690
Do I have something
on my face?

12:44.231 --> 12:45.665
Looks like I'm
stuck with her.

12:45.698 --> 12:46.633
Not necessarily.

12:46.666 --> 12:48.601
I was combing through
the Student Handbook

12:48.635 --> 12:50.838
and I found this...

12:50.871 --> 12:53.206
"Although supervised
by faculty,

12:53.240 --> 12:54.641
creative control of
theatrical productions

12:54.674 --> 12:56.643
must ultimately lie
with the students.

12:56.676 --> 12:58.511
Therefore any student
assistant director

12:58.545 --> 13:01.348
shall have the power to
make creative decisions."

13:01.381 --> 13:02.749
That's fantastic!

13:02.782 --> 13:03.750
What does it mean?

13:03.783 --> 13:04.818
You can replace Valerie!

13:04.852 --> 13:07.587
You have the power and
Mr. Stark can't stop you.

13:07.620 --> 13:11.658
Corki, I knew
you'd come through!

13:13.326 --> 13:16.196
About that moment that
we had at the dance...

13:16.229 --> 13:18.231
We had a great time.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.834
But it's good to be able to
work closely like this

13:20.868 --> 13:25.172
without any romantic
stuff getting in the way.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.507
Totally.

13:30.677 --> 13:32.880
One minute he seems
to like me, the next,

13:32.913 --> 13:35.248
he acts like we're
just friends.

13:35.282 --> 13:36.516
Boys.

13:36.549 --> 13:38.385
Fried pickles for sure.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.287
Right, Jodi?

13:40.320 --> 13:42.322
Helloooo, Jodi.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.524
You've had your nose
in that book all day.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.259
Valerie is making
me power-learn!

13:46.293 --> 13:48.896
I have to read like a
hundred chapters in one day!

13:48.929 --> 13:50.130
Luckyyyyyyy!

13:50.163 --> 13:52.832
But why should I work so hard
on something I'll never use?

13:56.636 --> 13:59.506
* Where are my girls at
Where are my boys *

13:59.539 --> 14:02.542
* Cause we wanna, make
some, make some noise *

14:02.575 --> 14:04.945

what the neighbors say *

14:04.978 --> 14:07.747

14:14.587 --> 14:17.424
* Everybody knows That
it could get crazy *

14:17.457 --> 14:20.293
* What, you know we
Shake it up, real good *

14:20.327 --> 14:23.563
* We'll move it like, oh
we'll move it right, oh *

14:23.596 --> 14:26.299
* We'll move like
you've never seen before *

14:26.333 --> 14:30.971
* Believe, we leave,
you searching our name *

14:31.004 --> 14:35.608
* Don't you know we're
with you til' the end *

14:35.642 --> 14:41.581
* So don't even pretend
That you don't wanna ride *

14:41.614 --> 14:42.983
* All together,
All together *

14:43.016 --> 14:45.852
* We're making moves so
baby come follow *

14:45.885 --> 14:48.855
* Where we go there's

* Oh oh oh, we're gonna do
it like, oh oh oh, hey *

15:03.536 --> 15:05.705

15:08.942 --> 15:12.345

15:46.646 --> 15:49.582
* We're making moves

* Oh oh oh, we're gonna do
it like, oh oh oh, Hey *

15:59.926 --> 16:01.528
I'm going to ace that test.

16:01.561 --> 16:02.562
Atta girl!

16:02.595 --> 16:04.464
Good grades are important.

16:04.497 --> 16:05.332
What?

16:05.365 --> 16:06.466
They help keep
adults off your back.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.868
That's, like, the most
important thing in the world.

16:08.901 --> 16:10.770
It'll also help
if you plan on

16:10.803 --> 16:12.572
getting into a design
school some day.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.274
I hate it when you
guys are reasonable.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.476
If it makes you feel any better,
the time you spend with Valerie

16:16.509 --> 16:17.944
is giving me more
time alone with Jared.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.146
It does.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.048
Whenever I feel like giving
Valerie a piece of my mind,

16:21.081 --> 16:22.782
I'll just think about
how I'm doing you a solid.

16:22.815 --> 16:23.583
Heyyy!

16:23.616 --> 16:25.918
Look at that a new
study method.

16:25.952 --> 16:30.790
You're making
progress already.

16:30.823 --> 16:31.791
Sun Hi:
Mr. Stark,

16:31.824 --> 16:32.459
Mr. Stark!

16:32.492 --> 16:33.960
Hold up.

16:33.993 --> 16:34.961
Mr. Stark.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.064
Care to comment on the
rumors that your Dorothy

16:37.097 --> 16:39.099
can only sing notes
that Toto can hear?

16:39.132 --> 16:42.402
Art is pain, Sun Hi.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.104
Sometimes painful
to the artist.

16:44.137 --> 16:46.439
Sometimes painful
for the audience.

16:46.473 --> 16:47.006
Really?

16:47.040 --> 16:47.907
Not in my experience.

16:47.940 --> 16:49.709
Have you noticed a
dip in ticket sales

16:49.742 --> 16:51.111
since deciding
not to cast me?

16:51.144 --> 16:52.445
Leave me alone!

16:52.479 --> 16:53.880
We're not close
to done yet!

16:59.852 --> 17:00.887
What else you got?

17:00.920 --> 17:02.722
You did not read
all of that.

17:02.755 --> 17:03.856
Come at me, bro!

17:03.890 --> 17:04.857
Quiz me!

17:04.891 --> 17:05.858
Yeah, I'm serious now.

17:05.892 --> 17:07.127
All right.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.096
Then you can move on to learning
the characteristics of minerals

17:09.129 --> 17:11.631
and describing the process
by which they're formed.

17:11.664 --> 17:12.332
Wait.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.433
You're supposed
to help me.

17:13.466 --> 17:14.467
Not just assign
busywork.

17:14.501 --> 17:15.668
I am helping you.

17:15.702 --> 17:18.471
But I also have an issue with
a certain friend of yours

17:18.505 --> 17:20.940
who keeps interfering
with my personal life, so.

17:20.973 --> 17:23.143
No one is leaving this
room until I know

17:23.176 --> 17:27.680
everything I
need to know.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.782
Fine.

17:32.152 --> 17:34.554
Sun Hi, have
you seen Jodi?

17:34.587 --> 17:35.355
Nope.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.889
I'm on the hunt
for someone else.

17:36.923 --> 17:38.158
How come?

17:38.191 --> 17:39.559
No reason.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.894
I mean I don't even
know why I asked.

17:41.928 --> 17:44.764
It's not like I'm not looking
for her or anything.

17:44.797 --> 17:47.100
I mean, Jodi who?

17:54.741 --> 17:56.476
Hey!

17:56.509 --> 17:59.879
Have you two been
studying all night?

17:59.912 --> 18:02.949
Maybe it's time
you took a break.

18:02.982 --> 18:05.017
There are people
not looking for you.

18:05.051 --> 18:05.918
Had to study.

18:05.952 --> 18:07.854
The test is today.

18:07.887 --> 18:08.921
Good luck with it.

18:08.955 --> 18:09.789
Mr. Stark!

18:09.822 --> 18:10.357
Aaaaah!

18:10.390 --> 18:11.924
Sun Hi, not a good time.

18:11.958 --> 18:13.160
I'm late for a meeting.

18:13.193 --> 18:16.563
I wanted you to know that my
vlog is finished and uploaded.

18:16.596 --> 18:17.063
Look!

18:17.096 --> 18:18.331
Oh, good for you.

18:18.365 --> 18:21.201
Now, we just have to wait for
my public support to pour in.

18:21.234 --> 18:22.001
Hold on.

18:22.034 --> 18:22.669
People aren't
talking about me.

18:22.702 --> 18:24.003
They're talking
about you.

18:24.036 --> 18:24.804
They love you.

18:24.837 --> 18:26.206
And they love your
catch phrase--

18:26.239 --> 18:27.006
Leave me alone!

18:27.039 --> 18:34.481
Yeah, that's the one.

18:34.514 --> 18:35.482
I've been out-webbed.

18:37.584 --> 18:40.220
Mr. Stark: I can't believe
that's an official rule.

18:40.253 --> 18:42.922
I knew I should've
read the whole handbook.

18:42.955 --> 18:43.890
So Valerie's demoted.

18:43.923 --> 18:46.659
I just hope you have a
plan to replace her.

18:46.693 --> 18:50.663
I mean big decisions like
this make me very uncomfortable.

18:50.697 --> 18:54.000
It's why I've lived with
my mother for so long.

18:54.033 --> 18:57.970
I do have a plan:
Corki Chang.

18:58.004 --> 18:59.105
The Cowardly Lion?

18:59.138 --> 19:02.209
I've been rehearsing with
her lately, she's amazing.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.911
She deserves a
much bigger role.

19:04.944 --> 19:06.646
Much bigger.

19:06.679 --> 19:08.548
I hope you know
what you're doing.

19:10.082 --> 19:11.684
Is it time for
rehearsal yet?

19:11.718 --> 19:12.785
Am I late?

19:12.819 --> 19:15.855
What day is it?

19:15.888 --> 19:17.857
Hi Jared.

19:17.890 --> 19:20.260
Your decision,
you tell her.

19:20.293 --> 19:22.695
I'm sorry I missed
rehearsal, Jared.

19:22.729 --> 19:24.130
But I'm ready
to work now.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.198
I promise.

19:25.232 --> 19:27.099
Valerie, we need
to talk...

19:27.133 --> 19:28.968
Okay!

19:29.836 --> 19:32.739
Valerie: Ahhhhhhh!!!

19:38.811 --> 19:40.247
Valerie?

19:40.280 --> 19:42.215
Are you okay?

19:42.249 --> 19:44.050
I got demoted
from the play.

19:44.083 --> 19:45.051
Really?

19:45.084 --> 19:48.154
Rejection is an entirely
new experience for me.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.756
I think I hate it.

19:49.789 --> 19:52.792
In more upbeat news, I
crushed my science test.

19:52.825 --> 19:54.060
It'll bring up my GPA.

19:54.093 --> 19:55.061
How'd that happen?

19:55.094 --> 19:56.829
I was well tutored.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.998
Oh.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.701
Well I guess that
is good news.

20:01.734 --> 20:02.902
To be honest,

20:02.935 --> 20:05.972
You're a passionate and
dedicated student...

20:06.005 --> 20:07.240
and I'm...

20:07.274 --> 20:09.276
I'm... very proud
of you, Jodi.

20:16.148 --> 20:17.116
Sun Hi: That's
different.

20:17.149 --> 20:18.718
Jodi: She's had
a rough day.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.119
Let's just leave
it at that.

20:20.152 --> 20:21.921
You think we were
wrong about her?

20:21.954 --> 20:23.756
Valerie: Out of my
way, you freshman!

20:23.790 --> 20:24.123
Nope.

20:24.156 --> 20:24.557
Guess not.

20:24.591 --> 20:25.592
Not even close.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.261
I've got a whole new vision
I'm going to pitch to Stark.

20:28.295 --> 20:29.662
I think you're
my mouse.

20:29.696 --> 20:30.863
Do you mean muse?

20:30.897 --> 20:32.299
No I think it's
pronounced "mouse."

20:32.332 --> 20:34.734
Like when you hear a
squeaking and you go,

20:34.767 --> 20:35.735
"What's that?
What's that?"

20:35.768 --> 20:38.305
and then you see your
mouse and you go eek!

20:38.338 --> 20:40.307
And then you get
a great idea!

20:40.340 --> 20:41.608
Uh.

20:41.641 --> 20:43.209
Sure.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.645
Like a EurEEKah
moment.

20:45.678 --> 20:48.147
Go on.

20:48.180 --> 20:49.616
Listen up everybody!

20:49.649 --> 20:52.619
I know you've all been
working very hard,

20:52.652 --> 20:55.855
but from here on out you're
gonna take a backseat to Corki.

20:55.888 --> 20:57.357
Oh, that's not
necessary--

20:57.390 --> 20:59.759
She's the real star.

20:59.792 --> 21:02.929
The rest of us are
just negative space.

21:02.962 --> 21:04.964
Jared, you really
don't have to do this--

21:04.997 --> 21:05.898
Of course I do.

21:05.932 --> 21:08.301
I've seen what you're
capable of, Corki.

21:08.335 --> 21:10.903
The rest of these people
pale in comparison.

21:10.937 --> 21:13.239
It's like you're the big
dipper and they're like...

21:13.272 --> 21:16.309
What's that smaller,
lesser star formation?

21:16.343 --> 21:18.077
The little dipper?

21:18.110 --> 21:19.111
It doesn't matter.

21:19.145 --> 21:20.780
You're the star!

21:20.813 --> 21:23.215
Not so loud...

21:23.249 --> 21:26.152
Oh, let them leave.

21:26.185 --> 21:27.420
We don't need them.

21:27.454 --> 21:30.323
We have each other...

21:30.357 --> 21:32.659
*
