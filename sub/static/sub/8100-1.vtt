02:25.228 --> 02:28.649
(Man reciting)

03:16.905 --> 03:20.325
(Speaking French)

03:20.450 --> 03:22.285
(Speaking French)

03:22.411 --> 03:24.663
- Want a hot dog?
- No, thanks.

03:24.788 --> 03:27.582
Just ketchup, please.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.128
Thanks.

03:31.253 --> 03:32.879
Listen, I've got an errand to run.

03:34.005 --> 03:35.465
(Chuckles)

03:36.007 --> 03:38.635
Kind of skimpy on the ketchup.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.680
Duncan, I've got to do this alone.

03:41.805 --> 03:43.306
What?
Wait, wait, wait.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.810
You called me in Paris,
and you said we have to meet.

03:47.269 --> 03:50.188
Now suddenly you've
got an errand to run?

03:50.313 --> 03:52.524
What's going on?

03:52.649 --> 03:54.526
I don't know.

03:54.651 --> 03:56.153
It's...

03:57.446 --> 03:59.448
...nothing.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.199
You OK?

04:02.617 --> 04:05.787
Yeah. I'm OK.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.414
Really.

04:07.539 --> 04:10.834
I know you better
than that, Connor.

04:10.959 --> 04:12.919
Haven't seen you like this.

04:14.421 --> 04:17.298
People change, Duncan.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.593
You'll learn that.

04:19.718 --> 04:21.261
Fine.

04:21.386 --> 04:23.555
You can tell me
all about it tonight.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.308
8:00 at the bar.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.852
And you're buying.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.562
Right.

04:30.687 --> 04:33.023
8:00, and I'm buying.

04:33.148 --> 04:34.483
Mm-hmm.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.196
You sure you
gonna be all right, Connor?

04:39.321 --> 04:41.823
Of course. Duncan...

04:46.286 --> 04:47.621
...watch your back.

05:11.228 --> 05:13.396
(Bell ringing)

05:15.148 --> 05:16.691
Connor?

05:19.194 --> 05:20.529
Connor?

05:49.641 --> 05:51.560
(Voices on TV)

06:02.696 --> 06:04.114
(Connor on TV) 'OK.'

06:06.491 --> 06:07.659
(Girl on TV) 'What is it, Connor?'

06:07.784 --> 06:08.785
(Connor) 'Open it.'

06:08.910 --> 06:10.203
(Girl) 'Oh, a ballerina.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.456
'Wow. She's beautiful.

06:13.582 --> 06:15.333
'Thank you.'

06:15.458 --> 06:17.210
'Mmm, my angel.'

06:17.335 --> 06:19.337
(Music playing)

06:22.966 --> 06:24.801
(Connor) 'Oh, my God,
I'm so proud of you.'

06:24.926 --> 06:25.927
'I love you, Connor.'

06:26.052 --> 06:27.220
'I love you, my Rachel.

06:27.345 --> 06:28.763
'Oh, God,
I'm proud of you.'

06:28.889 --> 06:29.973
(Rachel) 'Thank you.'

06:30.098 --> 06:32.100
(Telephone rings)

06:40.483 --> 06:44.863
(Telephone continues ringing)

06:53.413 --> 06:58.460
(Telephone continues ringing)

06:58.585 --> 06:59.794
(Beeping)

06:59.920 --> 07:00.712
Hello?

07:00.837 --> 07:01.963
(Beeping)

07:08.678 --> 07:10.513
Rachel!

07:16.353 --> 07:18.271
(Connor) 'Rachel.

07:18.396 --> 07:20.440
'My beloved Rachel.

07:24.611 --> 07:27.405
'How long has it been
since she died?

07:27.530 --> 07:31.451
'A year?
A century? More?

07:31.576 --> 07:33.453
'My mind keeps slipping,

07:33.578 --> 07:36.831
'but some things I know.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.834
'I am Connor MacLeod
of the Clan MacLeod,

07:39.960 --> 07:44.881
'and once,
a very long time ago,

07:45.006 --> 07:47.384
'I was a Highlander.

07:59.562 --> 08:01.147
'Born of this land,

08:01.272 --> 08:04.359
'and like this land, immortal.'

08:13.785 --> 08:14.661
(Dogs barking)

08:14.786 --> 08:16.204
(Man) Witch!

08:16.329 --> 08:19.165
You brought
this plague on us.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.626
You damned us all,
Connor MacLeod.

08:21.751 --> 08:23.128
You sold your soul!

08:24.295 --> 08:26.464
(Man) You're a witch!
You child of Satan!

08:26.589 --> 08:30.260
They drove you from your home,
cut you off from your own people.

08:30.385 --> 08:32.178
What else do they want?

08:32.303 --> 08:33.513
Someone to blame.

08:33.638 --> 08:35.472
Your mother will burn!

08:35.597 --> 08:36.975
Connor.

08:37.100 --> 08:40.437
Your mother will burn!
Rot in hell!

08:40.562 --> 08:42.313
Get in the house.

08:43.188 --> 08:44.858
(Connor) Get off my land!

08:44.983 --> 08:46.568
Leave us in peace!

08:46.693 --> 08:48.194
Get off my land!

08:53.783 --> 08:55.160
(Heather) Connor, please.

08:55.285 --> 08:57.328
You're not going back to Glenfinnan.

08:57.454 --> 08:59.372
I have no choice.

08:59.497 --> 09:01.166
Connor, please.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.585
They can't hurt me,
and they know it,

09:03.710 --> 09:06.379
but they can still
hurt the ones I love.

09:07.297 --> 09:08.798
I'm afraid.

09:10.216 --> 09:12.218
I love you, Heather.

09:12.343 --> 09:14.220
More than anything in this world.

09:14.345 --> 09:16.431
Do you believe me?

09:16.556 --> 09:17.599
Yes.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.392
Then don't be afraid.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.811
Nothing can keep me from you.

09:25.815 --> 09:27.734
(Horse whinnies)

09:27.859 --> 09:28.943
Nothing.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.072
(Horse neighs)

10:20.954 --> 10:22.872
Connor.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.417
I thought you might be
the water horse...

10:26.543 --> 10:30.255
come to take me on his back
and drown me in the loch.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.723
No one comes
to take care of you?

10:40.849 --> 10:42.267
(Mother) Not in years.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.269
They think I bedevil
their children

10:44.394 --> 10:47.730
because my own was banished.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.818
I'm sorry.

10:51.943 --> 10:53.403
I'm so sorry.

10:55.780 --> 11:00.493
Tiny mites
and soured dispositions.

11:02.620 --> 11:05.957
I've no need of them, Connor,
any of them.

11:11.171 --> 11:14.174
Then it's settled.
You're coming with me.

11:19.262 --> 11:20.847
(Wind blows)

11:20.972 --> 11:21.973
Aah!

11:22.098 --> 11:23.558
Connor!

11:23.683 --> 11:25.226
Connor, what is it?

11:25.351 --> 11:26.769
I'm not sure.

11:26.895 --> 11:28.188
It happened once before.

11:28.313 --> 11:29.397
Aah!

11:29.522 --> 11:31.774
Aah! Connor!

11:36.279 --> 11:40.783
(Priest) In the name of the Holy See
and the rule of law...

11:40.909 --> 11:41.910
Jacob?

11:42.035 --> 11:46.372
...you are hereby charged,
Connor MacLeod, with heresy

11:46.497 --> 11:49.375
and the practise of black magic.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.086
We were friends, remember, Jacob?

11:52.212 --> 11:53.796
I stood at your ordination.

11:53.922 --> 11:55.256
I vouched for you.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.091
You shouldn't have
come back, Connor.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.551
(Priest) Take him.

11:59.928 --> 12:01.012
Aah!

12:02.722 --> 12:04.599
(Priest speaking indistinctly)

12:08.937 --> 12:15.401
(Priest) The ties of blood
cannot be severed by word or deed.

12:21.658 --> 12:22.617
(Gasps)

12:22.742 --> 12:24.118
(Connor) Mother.

12:24.244 --> 12:28.373
(Jacob) Due to the infinite compassion

12:29.457 --> 12:33.169
you are entitled
to one final opportunity

12:33.294 --> 12:35.129
to renounce all that is unholy,

12:35.255 --> 12:39.676
and declare Connor MacLeod
not of your loins.

12:41.302 --> 12:43.096
How say you,
Caiolin MacLeod?

12:45.473 --> 12:47.850
If your God

12:47.976 --> 12:52.063
should persecute me
into the next world,

12:52.188 --> 12:54.941
then I shall simply have
to find myself another.

12:55.066 --> 12:56.150
(Gasps)

12:56.276 --> 12:57.610
(Crowd muttering)

12:57.735 --> 12:58.987
(Woman) Burn her!

12:59.112 --> 13:01.990
No! No! No!

13:03.157 --> 13:05.702
(Jacob) He is your son.

13:05.827 --> 13:07.787
I am silent for you.

13:10.999 --> 13:13.293
(Connor grunting)

13:15.503 --> 13:16.879
(Man) Black powder.

13:17.005 --> 13:18.423
It will ease your suffering.

13:22.677 --> 13:24.304
(Connor) Mother!

13:28.099 --> 13:30.184
No!

13:32.687 --> 13:34.314
No!

13:39.319 --> 13:40.611
(Grunting)

13:47.493 --> 13:49.412
(Caiolin weeping)

13:51.622 --> 13:53.333
(Screaming)

14:01.758 --> 14:03.551
(Grunts)

14:03.676 --> 14:05.970
(Man) You're next, you demon!

14:15.313 --> 14:16.606
Aah!

14:18.483 --> 14:19.692
(Growling)

14:26.240 --> 14:27.658
(Horse neighs)

14:38.252 --> 14:39.545
Aah!

14:41.964 --> 14:44.175
My water horse.

15:02.485 --> 15:04.278
Uh!

15:07.740 --> 15:09.784
(Man) The Devil's come back to life!

15:18.793 --> 15:20.920
(Priest) Let her be, Connor.

15:22.046 --> 15:23.548
Aah!

15:27.468 --> 15:28.678
Father?

15:29.554 --> 15:30.721
(Jacob) Father?

15:32.348 --> 15:34.100
Please.

15:34.225 --> 15:35.893
Do not leave me.

15:37.103 --> 15:38.729
Father.

15:50.908 --> 15:51.993
Aah!

15:52.118 --> 15:53.828
(Jacob grunts)

15:59.208 --> 16:00.626
Connor...

16:40.416 --> 16:45.463
(Connor) 'My endless days
are filled with memories of the past

16:45.588 --> 16:49.175
'and the death of my mother
by Jacob Kell.'

17:09.111 --> 17:11.531
(Engine revs)

17:25.086 --> 17:28.464
(Man) Boy, you people are
extremely difficult to find.

17:28.589 --> 17:30.091
We like it that way.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.686
Go ahead, man.
Take your pick.

17:43.521 --> 17:44.730
Uh!

17:53.072 --> 17:54.156
Uh!

17:56.450 --> 17:57.952
Aah!

18:07.420 --> 18:09.171
(Engine revs)

18:31.068 --> 18:32.528
(Gun cocks)

18:35.823 --> 18:37.158
(Fires gun)

19:00.806 --> 19:02.933
Aah.

19:08.439 --> 19:10.858
Take their heads.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.485
They might be Immortals.

19:12.610 --> 19:14.111
Yes, they might be.

19:29.418 --> 19:31.128
Aah!

19:41.514 --> 19:42.973
Don't be long.

19:43.099 --> 19:44.600
(Coughs)

19:59.907 --> 20:01.992
The Sanctuary.

20:02.952 --> 20:04.829
So it's true.

20:13.254 --> 20:17.007
What sacrifices
they have made of you,

20:17.133 --> 20:20.845
warehoused like
rotting pieces of meat.

20:26.308 --> 20:30.688
Tell me,
is this the better way?

20:30.813 --> 20:35.317
(Kell) I'm sure you've had
time to reflect upon it.

20:36.527 --> 20:38.904
What you need to understand

20:39.029 --> 20:41.782
is that I don't care
about the game.

20:42.616 --> 20:44.368
I don't care about the rules.

20:44.493 --> 20:48.581
I don't even care about
these pathetic souls

20:48.706 --> 20:53.169
you keep locked away
as a barrier to the prize.

20:53.753 --> 20:57.715
Which one is Connor MacLeod?

21:08.434 --> 21:10.811
(Whistling)

21:21.906 --> 21:23.407
(Grunts)

21:28.329 --> 21:29.955
(Strained breathing)

22:01.654 --> 22:03.155
Well, what do we do now?

22:03.906 --> 22:05.616
What we always do.

22:05.741 --> 22:07.743
We're Watchers, not cops.

22:07.868 --> 22:10.037
(Man) We'll find another volunteer.

22:13.541 --> 22:15.459
(Bell tolling)

22:20.381 --> 22:23.133
(Telephone rings)

22:29.431 --> 22:32.101
(Telephone continues ringing)

22:44.113 --> 22:46.740
(Ring continues)

22:54.665 --> 22:58.586
(Woman) 'Whatever you fear
about Connor MacLeod,

22:58.711 --> 23:00.337
'fear the worst.'

23:02.381 --> 23:03.549
Who is this?

23:03.674 --> 23:05.050
A friend.

23:06.594 --> 23:08.429
'Don't bother looking for me, Duncan.'

23:10.431 --> 23:12.850
(Dial tone)

23:19.148 --> 23:20.983
He's on the move.

23:30.534 --> 23:33.787
Duncan MacLeod
of the Clan MacLeod.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.248
Hello, Methos.

23:36.373 --> 23:39.835
What brings you
to my humble abode?

23:39.960 --> 23:41.211
Need your help.

23:42.212 --> 23:43.422
Why me?

23:43.547 --> 23:45.382
(Duncan) You've been around
for 5,000 years.

23:46.759 --> 23:50.095
I want the benefit of your experience.

23:50.220 --> 23:53.349
And I thought it was a social call.

23:54.850 --> 23:56.560
You ever had nightmares?

23:57.102 --> 23:58.354
What kind of nightmares?

23:59.063 --> 24:00.981
Bloody images

24:01.106 --> 24:03.233
powerful enough to even
break your meditation.

24:04.443 --> 24:07.446
We live violent lives, MacLeod.

24:07.571 --> 24:09.156
Some of that's
bound to stay with us.

24:10.616 --> 24:13.786
These ones came 10 years to the day
that Connor MacLeod disappeared.

24:15.371 --> 24:17.122
Connor had good reason to go.

24:17.247 --> 24:19.500
He told me how much
Rachel meant to him.

24:19.625 --> 24:23.045
There was more to it than that.
I was with him that day.

24:23.170 --> 24:25.005
The day Rachel was killed?

24:25.130 --> 24:27.132
Something wasn't right.

24:27.257 --> 24:28.759
'Connor, you OK?'

24:28.884 --> 24:32.763
'Yeah. I'm OK.
Really.'

24:32.888 --> 24:35.307
'I know you better
than that, Connor.

24:35.432 --> 24:38.686
'I've never seen you like this.'

24:38.811 --> 24:41.772
'People change, Duncan.

24:41.897 --> 24:43.482
'You'll learn that.'

24:45.609 --> 24:47.695
I need to know
if he's still alive, Methos.

24:49.279 --> 24:51.407
You know a little
about Buddhist monks.

24:51.532 --> 24:53.575
Some of them come
to cherish life so much

24:53.701 --> 24:57.705
that to step on an insect
or harm a blade of grass

24:57.830 --> 24:59.707
becomes a violation
of their creed,

24:59.832 --> 25:04.086
so they place themselves under
an extreme form of protective custody...

25:05.004 --> 25:06.338
A Sanctuary of sorts.

25:07.673 --> 25:10.426
Well, for an Immortal
who comes to abhor the bloodshed,

25:10.551 --> 25:12.302
there's a similar solution...

25:12.428 --> 25:14.888
A way to be removed
from the game forever.

25:15.014 --> 25:17.558
The price is unimaginably high,

25:17.683 --> 25:23.605
but you are, for all practical purposes,
protected from the violence within you.

25:23.731 --> 25:25.816
And it's called The Sanctuary.

25:26.358 --> 25:27.776
Connor would never do that.

25:27.901 --> 25:31.155
Are you sure? It's been around
since before you were born.

25:31.905 --> 25:33.449
At least until last night.

25:33.574 --> 25:35.284
What happened last night?

25:36.493 --> 25:38.162
It was annihilated.

25:54.219 --> 25:56.930
(Connor) 'Hey, Duncan,
what's the matter?'

25:57.056 --> 25:59.266
(Duncan) 'The British
destroyed the clans, Connor.

26:00.184 --> 26:01.351
'Scotland's finished.'

26:01.477 --> 26:04.188
(Connor) 'Scotland will always
be Scotland, '

26:04.313 --> 26:06.190
and someday you'll go back.

26:06.315 --> 26:07.816
You can bet on it.

26:07.941 --> 26:10.069
- How much?
- Aw, come on.

26:10.194 --> 26:12.863
Does everything have
to be a wager with you?

26:12.988 --> 26:14.865
Well, you're the one
that keeps telling me

26:14.990 --> 26:17.159
our lives are nothing
but a boundless game.

26:17.284 --> 26:19.119
(Chuckles)

26:19.661 --> 26:21.497
(Duncan) Good morning, gentlemen.

26:21.622 --> 26:23.165
What seems to be
the problem here?

26:23.290 --> 26:25.959
(Man) They refuses to pay her toll, sir.

26:26.085 --> 26:27.920
(Duncan) Really? How dare they?

26:28.045 --> 26:29.296
These men are rogues.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.673
(Faith) These men are
liars and scoundrels, sir.

26:31.799 --> 26:34.635
They've done nothing but prey upon us
three years running,

26:34.760 --> 26:36.678
right at this very spot.

26:36.804 --> 26:39.098
And by whose authority
do you act?

26:39.223 --> 26:41.391
By Deed of the King.

26:43.060 --> 26:45.312
(Connor)
There is a little 'X' down here.

26:46.021 --> 26:48.440
Does the King always
sign his name with an 'X'?

26:48.565 --> 26:49.942
Excuse me. Sorry.

26:50.067 --> 26:51.568
I think these gentlemen
should be paid.

26:51.693 --> 26:53.153
That deed is a fake.

26:53.278 --> 26:54.530
That's a matter of opinion.

26:54.655 --> 26:56.698
You, sir,
are no better than they.

26:57.157 --> 26:59.201
That is also a matter of opinion.

26:59.326 --> 27:00.869
Here you go.

27:02.496 --> 27:03.497
Ladies.

27:04.331 --> 27:05.374
It's gold!

27:05.499 --> 27:07.584
Why not... It's gold.

27:07.709 --> 27:08.836
(First man laughs)

27:08.961 --> 27:10.337
Hey, wait a minute.
They took my money!

27:10.462 --> 27:11.797
Oh, it's here.

27:11.922 --> 27:13.340
They took my money!

27:13.465 --> 27:14.675
(Man) Let's go get 'em!

27:15.259 --> 27:16.260
Shall we?

27:16.385 --> 27:17.594
(Yelling)

27:17.719 --> 27:18.929
Aye.

27:20.597 --> 27:22.266
(Man) Ah!

27:25.144 --> 27:26.478
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

27:35.571 --> 27:36.655
Heh heh.

27:36.780 --> 27:38.949
(Connor) Not bad.
Uh-oh.

27:40.701 --> 27:41.785
Mmm.

27:43.287 --> 27:45.497
All right boys, time to go.
Let's go!

27:46.206 --> 27:47.875
Come on!

27:48.959 --> 27:50.878
(Duncan) Oh. Cuckoo.

27:51.003 --> 27:53.547
Oh, looks heavy, huh?

27:53.672 --> 27:55.090
(Duncan) Looks like
you lost your edge, lad.

27:55.215 --> 27:56.300
(Connor) Really heavy.

27:56.425 --> 27:58.760
- Or could he be lass?
- Could be.

27:58.886 --> 28:00.554
Could be.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.264
(Groaning)

28:03.307 --> 28:04.433
Hyah!

28:05.934 --> 28:07.352
(Driver) Come on!

28:07.477 --> 28:09.646
Hyah! Hyah!

28:11.565 --> 28:13.066
Hyah!

30:03.677 --> 30:04.803
(Bombs exploding)

30:04.928 --> 30:06.847
(Duncan) 'Corporal Duncan MacLeod,
sir.

30:07.639 --> 30:10.309
'I've come to pick up
the wounded.'

30:38.920 --> 30:40.881
(Indistinct chatter)

30:47.512 --> 30:48.930
You've improved greatly.

30:49.056 --> 30:51.141
Ah, you really think so?

30:55.520 --> 30:57.356
No.

30:57.481 --> 30:58.940
I'm just being gracious.

30:59.066 --> 31:00.650
Hmm.

31:01.777 --> 31:03.487
Now, remember.

31:03.612 --> 31:07.866
You are only immortal as long
as you can keep your head

31:07.991 --> 31:09.242
on your shoulders.

31:12.829 --> 31:14.247
Argh!

31:14.373 --> 31:19.628
Duncan, what you give up
to your adversary in defeat...

31:19.753 --> 31:20.837
...is everything.

31:21.505 --> 31:25.967
I know. And at that point,
I'm very, very dead. Come on!

31:26.093 --> 31:29.596
Not just dead, Duncan.
Empty!

31:32.349 --> 31:34.559
Aye, Connor, I know.
It's called the Quickening.

31:34.684 --> 31:36.812
Our strength and knowledge,
our life essence,

31:36.937 --> 31:40.065
flows into the victor, feeds him,
and makes him stronger, yes?

31:40.649 --> 31:43.318
It's what drives the other Immortals
to kill us,

31:43.443 --> 31:46.613
and what forces us to be smarter,
better than the rest.

31:46.738 --> 31:48.824
(Groans) I understand.

31:49.866 --> 31:51.159
Oh.

31:54.162 --> 31:55.747
You do?

31:56.373 --> 31:57.791
Oh.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.418
(Connor) Good.

32:00.419 --> 32:02.254
(Groans) I slipped.

32:02.379 --> 32:04.673
Listen, soon you
and I will have to part.

32:05.799 --> 32:08.969
There is one more thing
I want to give to you.

32:10.470 --> 32:11.513
(Grunts)

32:11.638 --> 32:12.806
<i>Va via. Va via!</i>

32:12.931 --> 32:15.267
(Laughing) Oh, aye!

32:15.392 --> 32:18.478
Oh, aye.
This is much more to my liking.

32:18.603 --> 32:19.980
Good.

32:20.105 --> 32:21.606
Bah!

32:23.525 --> 32:24.776
Attack me.

32:26.445 --> 32:27.904
But you've got your back to me.

32:29.197 --> 32:31.950
It's not always
about strength, Duncan.

32:32.075 --> 32:33.452
Attack me!

32:39.708 --> 32:41.168
Aah!

32:41.293 --> 32:43.920
It's about manipulation of the mind...

32:47.841 --> 32:49.301
...as well as the body.

32:49.426 --> 32:52.137
Aye, but now I'm in control.

32:52.929 --> 32:54.473
Are you?

32:58.310 --> 32:59.811
(Grunts)

33:01.730 --> 33:04.900
Remember well, my friend.

33:05.025 --> 33:08.403
Properly executed,
this move is unstoppable.

33:09.988 --> 33:13.074
Properly executed,
we'll now have this talk again.

33:26.630 --> 33:28.840
(Wind blows)

33:36.640 --> 33:38.308
Who are you?

33:38.433 --> 33:41.102
A friend or a lover.

33:41.686 --> 33:43.188
Or a wife.

33:43.313 --> 33:45.357
- Kate?
- Atta boy.

33:46.149 --> 33:48.318
Except I'm Faith now.

33:49.402 --> 33:51.863
Part of the makeover.

33:51.988 --> 33:53.240
What are you doing here?

33:54.366 --> 33:56.117
Remember our wedding day,
Duncan?

33:57.118 --> 33:59.120
I do.

33:59.246 --> 34:01.831
(Sighs) The way we danced.

34:01.957 --> 34:03.291
(Scottish music playing)

34:03.416 --> 34:05.168
I felt like we were flying.

34:13.927 --> 34:17.597
Of course, we did come down,
didn't we?

34:20.934 --> 34:22.476
Crashing.

34:24.938 --> 34:26.438
(Motorcycle engines revving)

34:26.565 --> 34:27.774
Oh, shit.

34:37.784 --> 34:42.581
(Man) It's time to show
our Immortal brother a thing or two.

34:52.632 --> 34:54.426
Somebody order a club sandwich?

34:54.551 --> 34:56.928
He's funny.
Nice outfit, too.

34:57.053 --> 34:59.764
Faith, I told you
I look like a fuckin' orange!

34:59.889 --> 35:02.350
I'm not dressing you black, Bob.
Trust me.

35:02.475 --> 35:04.477
- Who are they?
- Friends.

35:06.229 --> 35:08.023
What, it's a team sport now?

35:08.148 --> 35:09.441
What, you didn't know?

35:09.566 --> 35:11.192
It's a whole new ball game.

35:13.320 --> 35:14.654
Aah!

35:33.548 --> 35:34.799
Hey!

35:35.717 --> 35:37.302
Nice bat.

35:49.314 --> 35:50.398
Argh!

35:50.523 --> 35:51.775
Told you I was gonna cut you.

36:02.077 --> 36:04.079
(Growling)

36:10.502 --> 36:12.420
Let my man Jin Ke
deal with him.

36:15.048 --> 36:17.217
Jin Ke...

36:17.342 --> 36:19.094
...who served
with the Emperor Chin.

36:19.844 --> 36:21.429
The same man.

36:21.554 --> 36:23.515
Some people say
you're a man of honour.

36:23.640 --> 36:25.600
What do you know about honour?

36:27.477 --> 36:29.020
Oh, great.

36:30.605 --> 36:31.648
Yah!

37:15.859 --> 37:18.403
Honour's not in a weapon.

37:18.528 --> 37:19.863
It's in the man.

37:48.016 --> 37:49.601
(Kell) Enough!

37:53.188 --> 37:55.398
Boys, boys.

37:56.566 --> 37:58.151
(Kell) I do apologise.

37:58.735 --> 38:00.695
When it comes to discipline,

38:00.820 --> 38:04.741
the first hundred years
are the hardest.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.245
Oh!

38:10.663 --> 38:12.499
Oh!

38:13.917 --> 38:15.752
Guess I'm not much
of a swords guy.

38:15.877 --> 38:20.381
I thought I told you to stop.

38:21.382 --> 38:24.552
Yeah, well, I stopped.

38:24.677 --> 38:25.720
Tell me, Carlos.

38:25.845 --> 38:28.264
How much is your life worth?

38:28.389 --> 38:30.809
Don't start this bullshit, man.

38:30.934 --> 38:33.561
(Kell) 'Cause the only way
to win your freedom

38:33.686 --> 38:35.313
is to kill me.

38:35.438 --> 38:37.982
- You're crazy.
- Am I?

38:38.107 --> 38:39.567
Then go ahead.

38:39.692 --> 38:42.529
Stop the madness.

38:42.654 --> 38:44.197
(Tyres squealing)

38:44.322 --> 38:47.492
Can you live with the fear?

38:47.617 --> 38:50.411
Can you live
with the weakness?

38:53.039 --> 38:55.208
(Saw buzzes)

38:55.333 --> 38:57.001
Weakness, Carlos.

39:01.756 --> 39:03.424
I call this

39:03.550 --> 39:06.135
decap with a twist...

39:06.261 --> 39:07.595
No sugar.

39:50.305 --> 39:52.765
(Gasping)

39:55.184 --> 39:57.186
- Watchers?
- Huh?

40:00.023 --> 40:01.858
Watchers observe Immortals.

40:01.983 --> 40:03.860
They're not supposed to interfere.

40:03.985 --> 40:06.654
Unfortunately, our role
has changed somewhat.

40:06.779 --> 40:08.197
Why?

40:08.323 --> 40:10.033
Because the rules have been broken.

40:10.158 --> 40:14.412
One of your kind has gone renegade.

40:17.040 --> 40:19.459
In doing so, he's gained
himself a sizable advantage.

40:19.584 --> 40:21.920
One that'll be
impossible to overcome.

40:22.045 --> 40:23.504
Nobody's unbeatable.

40:23.630 --> 40:26.633
Oh, yes, Duncan.
He is.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.429
Unbeatable.

40:36.017 --> 40:37.435
No.

40:38.686 --> 40:40.647
(Grunting)

40:46.194 --> 40:47.487
Ah.

40:47.612 --> 40:48.696
(Grunts)

40:48.821 --> 40:51.240
Sorry about that.

40:51.366 --> 40:53.952
There must always
be two of your kind.

40:54.077 --> 40:57.413
As long as there are two,
and you're kept from fighting,

40:57.538 --> 40:59.415
then the prize is safe.

40:59.540 --> 41:02.168
The Sanctuary must not fail again.

41:02.293 --> 41:03.628
You're insane.

41:03.753 --> 41:06.130
(Duncan) Get yourself another volunteer.

41:06.255 --> 41:10.259
We had a number of volunteers!

41:10.385 --> 41:13.805
Sadly, that's no longer the case.

41:13.930 --> 41:16.516
You'll be warehoused, hidden away.

41:16.641 --> 41:18.142
Go to hell.

41:18.601 --> 41:20.436
Don't worry.

41:20.561 --> 41:23.564
(Distorted) The drugs
will kick in momentarily.

41:28.861 --> 41:32.782
(Heavy breathing)

41:35.994 --> 41:38.538
(Woman screaming)

41:42.750 --> 41:44.168
(Gasps)

41:46.295 --> 41:48.881
(Horse neighing)

41:49.007 --> 41:50.883
(Swords clanging)

41:51.759 --> 41:54.178
(Gasps)

42:01.894 --> 42:03.730
(Connor) Get up.

42:04.856 --> 42:06.733
Get up!

42:13.740 --> 42:16.534
You have better things to do
than lie there on your ass.

42:17.744 --> 42:19.287
Who are you?

42:19.412 --> 42:23.458
Someone who knows more about you
than you know about yourself.

42:23.583 --> 42:25.460
Are you a demon?

42:25.585 --> 42:30.089
(Laughing) I've been called that
and worse.

42:31.632 --> 42:33.760
I'm Connor MacLeod
of the Clan MacLeod.

42:33.885 --> 42:35.595
Connor MacLeod?

42:36.637 --> 42:40.933
And like you, my friend,
I have a hard time dying.

42:49.817 --> 42:52.403
(Metal tools rattling)

42:57.200 --> 42:58.242
Dawson?

42:59.619 --> 43:00.995
You look like shit.

43:01.120 --> 43:02.205
Thanks.

43:02.872 --> 43:03.873
How long have I...

43:03.998 --> 43:05.708
We'll talk about it later.
We gotta get outta here.

43:05.833 --> 43:08.377
Come on, can you walk?

43:08.503 --> 43:09.796
Yeah.

43:09.921 --> 43:11.130
Uh.

43:27.772 --> 43:30.733
(Duncan) Go. Go!
What are you doing here?

43:30.858 --> 43:32.318
(Methos) Keeping tabs on you.

43:32.902 --> 43:34.070
(Duncan) Yeah?

43:34.195 --> 43:38.324
Well, someone should keep tabs
on that psychotic asshole back there.

43:38.449 --> 43:39.992
Didn't you get it back in London?

43:40.118 --> 43:42.370
(Methos)
These guys don't play by the rules.

43:42.495 --> 43:44.163
You don't know what
you're up against, Mac.

43:44.288 --> 43:45.540
So people keep telling me.

43:45.665 --> 43:46.999
Stop the car.

43:47.125 --> 43:49.418
I managed to liberate
that from their lost and found.

43:50.253 --> 43:51.337
There's blood on it.

43:51.462 --> 43:53.339
I didn't say it was easy.

43:54.423 --> 43:56.300
- Pull over.
- (Methos) What?

43:56.425 --> 43:57.802
Pull over.

43:57.927 --> 44:00.555
(Dawson) MacLeod, tell me something.

44:00.680 --> 44:01.681
Mac, hear him out!

44:02.306 --> 44:04.267
Mac! Will you tell me something?

44:04.392 --> 44:06.978
Now, how many Quickenings
have you had?

44:09.397 --> 44:10.898
How many heads have you taken?

44:11.023 --> 44:13.526
I don't keep score.

44:13.651 --> 44:15.236
Well, we do.

44:22.743 --> 44:24.996
(Computer) 'MacLeod, Connor.'

44:25.121 --> 44:26.455
What's that?

44:26.581 --> 44:28.166
The Watchers' version of a résumé.

44:28.291 --> 44:31.711
'262 confirmed Immortal kills.'

44:32.587 --> 44:35.715
It's a bit like handicapping horses,
but it's part of the gig, all right?

44:35.840 --> 44:37.842
'MacLeod, Duncan.

44:37.967 --> 44:41.470
'174 confirmed Immortal kills.

44:41.596 --> 44:44.557
'174 confirmed Immortal kills.'

44:44.682 --> 44:46.350
Sound about right?

44:46.475 --> 44:48.644
So, what's your point?

44:48.769 --> 44:51.355
(Sighs) Here's the gentleman
you met in Connor's loft.

44:52.440 --> 44:58.696
'Kell, Jacob.
661 confirmed Immortal kills.

44:58.821 --> 45:02.617
'661 confirmed Immortal kills.'

45:02.742 --> 45:05.203
Welcome to your worst nightmare.

45:05.328 --> 45:07.538
Sanctuary wasn't shit, pal.

45:07.663 --> 45:10.249
This guy is way out of your league.

45:16.005 --> 45:18.591
I want to see
Connor MacLeod's body.

45:18.716 --> 45:20.134
Why?

45:20.259 --> 45:22.803
Something doesn't make sense.

45:22.929 --> 45:24.847
What are you saying?

45:24.972 --> 45:28.351
I think he's saying
he wants to see the body.

45:28.476 --> 45:30.019
Well, it's gonna be a rough I. D.

45:30.144 --> 45:32.647
They're all missing their heads!

45:44.158 --> 45:47.203
(♪ Harmonica)

46:13.229 --> 46:15.273
We gave 'em
a Christian burial, MacLeod.

46:15.398 --> 46:18.359
It was decent, you know.
Said all the right words.

46:18.484 --> 46:20.945
Can't begin to tell you
how reassuring that is.

46:21.070 --> 46:23.155
(Dawson) With all these
unexplained corpses,

46:23.281 --> 46:26.409
well, we had to take it
off the beaten track.

46:26.534 --> 46:28.369
End of the road, Joe.

46:30.579 --> 46:31.580
Thanks.

46:33.624 --> 46:36.210
You watch your ass, MacLeod.

46:36.335 --> 46:38.796
It's not my ass
I'm worried about.

46:42.258 --> 46:44.844
Did I happen to mention
about all this coming to a bad end?

46:45.845 --> 46:48.848
No, Methos.
I don't believe you did.

46:54.645 --> 46:56.147
You were gonna stay and dig.

46:56.272 --> 46:58.899
Dig? Oh, yeah!

46:59.025 --> 47:00.901
(Car door closes)

47:17.543 --> 47:19.378
(Thunder)

47:23.924 --> 47:27.428
(Duncan) 'I need to know
if he's still alive, Professor.

47:27.553 --> 47:30.598
'I want to see
Connor MacLeod's body.'

47:31.390 --> 47:35.311
(Methos) 'One of your kind
has gone renegade.'

47:40.274 --> 47:42.860
(Connor) 'People change, Duncan.

47:42.985 --> 47:44.820
'You'll learn that.'

47:48.824 --> 47:50.701
(Wind blows)

48:04.382 --> 48:06.092
(Connor speaking native language)

48:11.680 --> 48:12.848
No.

48:20.689 --> 48:22.233
What are you doing here?

48:23.776 --> 48:26.404
You walked out
on your life, Connor.

48:26.529 --> 48:27.571
Why?

48:30.658 --> 48:32.326
I had my reasons.

48:32.952 --> 48:34.036
Reasons?

48:37.039 --> 48:39.625
Every life I touch ends...

48:40.668 --> 48:44.046
...brutally and for no reason.

48:45.256 --> 48:48.175
It's a curse that's followed me
for centuries.

48:48.300 --> 48:49.718
(Chuckles)

48:49.844 --> 48:53.597
I can't outrun it,
and I can't outlive it.

48:55.683 --> 48:58.018
Rachel's death made you
the last soul on this planet

48:58.144 --> 48:59.478
that means a damn to me.

49:00.479 --> 49:02.314
I thought there was a way out.

49:02.440 --> 49:03.482
The Sanctuary?

49:05.151 --> 49:06.277
Yes.

49:08.988 --> 49:10.531
The Sanctuary.

49:11.740 --> 49:12.992
So, how did you escape?

49:14.785 --> 49:16.287
I didn't escape.

49:18.330 --> 49:19.457
I was let go.

49:23.127 --> 49:25.296
I couldn't see the slaughter...

49:26.130 --> 49:27.381
...only heard it...

49:28.674 --> 49:29.758
...and felt it.

49:32.136 --> 49:33.804
(Wind blows)

49:57.244 --> 49:59.205
(People yell)

50:02.458 --> 50:03.876
Jacob Kell.

50:15.304 --> 50:16.889
So, here we are.

50:17.431 --> 50:19.141
Both Immortal.

50:19.934 --> 50:23.687
Missed the signs,
didn't we?

50:23.812 --> 50:27.358
But we were both
so new at the game.

50:27.483 --> 50:29.485
(Thunder)

50:30.361 --> 50:31.779
(Duncan) Connor.

50:33.113 --> 50:36.325
What a glorious sight.

50:38.160 --> 50:40.496
Just look, Connor.

50:42.164 --> 50:45.668
Look back at the endless
travesties of your life,

50:45.793 --> 50:49.964
and you'll see me, always there
waiting in the shadows.

50:50.673 --> 50:53.551
When friends and lovers
are wiped from your sight...

50:54.593 --> 50:55.678
...I'm there.

50:56.428 --> 51:00.599
When those you cherish
die abruptly and for no reason

51:00.724 --> 51:02.726
I'm there for you.

51:03.852 --> 51:07.898
And when your cellmates
in their so-called Sanctuary

51:08.023 --> 51:11.151
are left twitching
like headless chickens...

51:12.570 --> 51:13.612
Guess who?

51:18.534 --> 51:19.785
(Duncan) Connor.

51:19.910 --> 51:22.204
(Connor) Stay out of it, Duncan.

51:27.042 --> 51:30.337
Would you kill
an unarmed man again, Connor?

51:31.463 --> 51:32.548
Oh!

51:33.299 --> 51:35.426
You didn't know, Duncan?

51:37.303 --> 51:39.346
Because you didn't tell him.

51:39.471 --> 51:43.976
Would that finally put the agony
in your soul to rest?

51:44.893 --> 51:46.812
Then go ahead.

51:46.937 --> 51:50.691
Send me home.

51:50.816 --> 51:52.276
What's stopping you?

51:52.901 --> 51:54.403
Honour?

51:54.862 --> 51:56.614
Guilt?

51:56.739 --> 52:00.409
The nagging sense that maybe you,
more than I, deserve to die?

52:01.702 --> 52:03.579
Or somewhere along the way

52:03.704 --> 52:06.624
did you just lose your nerve?

52:07.458 --> 52:08.709
It's holy ground, Connor.

52:08.834 --> 52:10.711
Hmm.

52:10.836 --> 52:12.379
Yes.

52:12.504 --> 52:15.257
Take your shot.

52:16.300 --> 52:17.885
What better chance than now?

52:18.927 --> 52:20.095
Do it.

52:20.888 --> 52:24.308
Do it for your sweet mother.

52:25.142 --> 52:26.393
'Aah!'

52:27.936 --> 52:30.314
Or the sweet little war orphan

52:30.439 --> 52:33.400
Rachel Ellenstein...

52:37.404 --> 52:38.781
...who, if I'm not mistaken,

52:38.906 --> 52:41.492
you raised
as your own daughter.

52:41.617 --> 52:43.702
Tell me, do they even begin

52:43.827 --> 52:46.163
to equal for the murder
of a man of God

52:46.288 --> 52:48.415
who raised me as his own son?

52:48.540 --> 52:50.793
'Aah!'

52:52.544 --> 52:53.921
Slow...

52:54.046 --> 52:55.798
...close...

52:56.674 --> 52:58.842
Feels good, doesn't it?

52:59.593 --> 53:01.428
But look at you.

53:02.179 --> 53:05.182
Even now, you're afraid,

53:05.307 --> 53:07.059
afraid you'll lose.

53:07.184 --> 53:09.061
That's your true fear, isn't it?

53:09.186 --> 53:11.730
The thought of giving up
your essence to me,

53:11.855 --> 53:15.567
making me
even stronger by it.

53:17.444 --> 53:19.279
What's wrong?

53:19.405 --> 53:22.908
Don't you want
to be inside me?

53:49.101 --> 53:52.146
I want you to think back
to this moment, Connor!

53:58.527 --> 54:00.571
In the endless nights ahead!

54:00.696 --> 54:02.197
(Connor) Aah!

54:15.294 --> 54:17.212
And know...

54:17.713 --> 54:20.716
...that every time
you close your eyes

54:20.841 --> 54:25.304
from now to eternity,
I'll be there!

54:26.930 --> 54:30.517
Ripping apart the ones
you care about most!

54:30.642 --> 54:32.019
Aah!

54:40.694 --> 54:44.448
It's never over,
Connor MacLeod.

54:44.573 --> 54:47.326
Living is what matters.

54:47.451 --> 54:51.538
And you will live with this.
Count on it.

54:52.247 --> 54:55.918
One far-off day, you and I
will be the only two remaining.

54:56.043 --> 54:57.878
You will look back on this

54:58.003 --> 55:01.673
and know you had
one chance to stop me.

55:01.799 --> 55:02.966
You failed.

55:03.550 --> 55:04.968
But until that day,

55:05.093 --> 55:07.888
I will take my vengeance
on those you love.

55:09.431 --> 55:13.393
Your living has been my prize.

55:14.269 --> 55:15.771
For old times' sake.

55:17.606 --> 55:19.525
(Jacob) 'He is your son.'

55:22.110 --> 55:24.863
You, on the other hand...

55:29.159 --> 55:32.579
...are on borrowed time.

55:32.704 --> 55:33.956
Call you.

55:39.503 --> 55:41.255
Is what he said true?

55:45.133 --> 55:46.134
Is it?

55:47.135 --> 55:51.473
Believe only what your heart
and conscience tell you.

55:52.391 --> 55:56.270
Connor, with time,
anything can be forgiven.

55:56.395 --> 55:58.230
You taught me that.

56:03.485 --> 56:05.070
Did I?

56:20.669 --> 56:23.589
(Clapping, laughing,
music playing)

56:34.057 --> 56:36.018
Oh, look at Dave. Dave!

56:36.143 --> 56:37.561
(Kate) Behave yourself, Duncan!

56:37.686 --> 56:39.479
(Man) No more talking!

56:39.605 --> 56:43.483
May all your hardships fade away.

56:43.609 --> 56:45.819
(Man) Till night becomes morn,

56:45.944 --> 56:49.072
let love remain
to guide your way.

56:49.197 --> 56:51.033
Till the day we are reborn.

56:52.534 --> 56:54.161
Till the day we are reborn.

56:54.286 --> 56:55.579
Kiss her, won't you?

56:55.704 --> 56:58.123
(Cheering and clapping)

57:04.504 --> 57:05.589
(Duncan) Connor?

57:09.343 --> 57:10.969
(Laughing)
I thought you'd never get here.

57:11.094 --> 57:12.596
Connor!

57:16.308 --> 57:19.353
(Connor) You know
Kate is like us, Immortal.

57:19.478 --> 57:21.813
Aye. I sensed something
the day we met,

57:21.939 --> 57:23.357
but I wasn't sure.

57:23.482 --> 57:25.317
Well, now you know.

57:26.526 --> 57:31.907
And you know as well as I do
that her immortality

57:32.032 --> 57:35.452
can only be triggered
by the shock of a violent death.

57:36.370 --> 57:38.330
Yes, I do.

57:38.455 --> 57:40.958
And without such a death,
she will simply grow old and die.

57:41.083 --> 57:42.793
Yes, I know, Connor.

57:42.918 --> 57:45.295
Is that what you came
to tell me on my wedding day?

57:45.420 --> 57:47.965
Come on.
Drink up, man.

57:48.090 --> 57:50.842
(Sets down mug) No.

57:51.510 --> 57:52.761
I was wondering.

57:55.430 --> 57:57.307
Does she know?

57:59.309 --> 58:00.394
Why?

58:06.942 --> 58:09.778
Many years
after I was married...

58:11.363 --> 58:12.864
...one night...

58:14.157 --> 58:17.411
...I found Heather
in front of the house.

58:17.536 --> 58:21.248
She had a knife in one hand
and her hair in the other.

58:21.373 --> 58:24.960
When I asked her why she
had done such a thing to herself,

58:25.085 --> 58:27.587
she said it was
the one part of her

58:27.713 --> 58:29.756
that would never age.

58:29.881 --> 58:31.717
It would forever
remain the same

58:31.842 --> 58:34.803
as when I first
fell in love with her.

58:36.013 --> 58:38.724
That's how she wanted me
to remember her.

58:39.474 --> 58:41.518
Why are you telling me this?

58:41.643 --> 58:45.856
Because I once loved a woman
more than life itself...

58:49.776 --> 58:51.737
...and I watched her die.

58:53.363 --> 58:56.533
Unlike me, you have a choice.

59:13.008 --> 59:15.260
What would you have me tell her?

59:15.385 --> 59:18.764
I'd tell her nothing.
She wouldn't believe you anyway.

59:18.889 --> 59:20.307
Then I can do nothing.

59:20.432 --> 59:23.602
She's in the flower of her youth.

59:23.727 --> 59:26.438
Enjoy the moment,
and let it pass.

59:26.563 --> 59:27.981
And if it were you in my place?

59:28.106 --> 59:29.983
I was in your place!

59:32.069 --> 59:34.613
But I thank God
I never had the choice.

59:34.738 --> 59:36.865
I love Kate,

59:36.990 --> 59:39.993
and I will hold on to her
as long as I can.

59:40.118 --> 59:42.120
And that is all I can do!

59:46.541 --> 59:49.127
(Duncan) 'Forever, my love.'

59:50.545 --> 59:52.297
'Until the day we are reborn.'

59:53.757 --> 59:55.342
'Until the day we are reborn.'

01:00:41.221 --> 01:00:43.306
(Wind blows)

01:00:51.690 --> 01:00:54.860
- You haven't lost your touch.
- What do you want?

01:00:54.985 --> 01:00:57.070
- To talk.
- Oh, that's a first.

01:00:57.195 --> 01:00:58.989
I've tried to talk to you
a thousand times...

01:00:59.114 --> 01:01:00.448
Get to the point.

01:01:00.574 --> 01:01:03.160
- I was wrong.
- Oh, no, no.

01:01:03.285 --> 01:01:04.786
Stealing is wrong.

01:01:04.911 --> 01:01:06.913
Lying is wrong.
Killing's wrong.

01:01:07.038 --> 01:01:08.957
What you did
goes well beyond wrong.

01:01:09.082 --> 01:01:12.085
Fine. I deserve that,

01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:13.795
but I want a chance
to make it right.

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.797
You want to make it right?

01:01:15.922 --> 01:01:18.800
Then give me back the ability
to have children,

01:01:18.925 --> 01:01:21.178
to grow old
with the man I love.

01:01:21.303 --> 01:01:23.555
How about anything that
resembles a normal life?

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.849
And you took it all
away from me.

01:01:25.974 --> 01:01:27.726
Those things I can't give you.

01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:30.270
Oh, something else
you forgot to tell me.

01:01:31.646 --> 01:01:32.731
Goodbye, Duncan.

01:01:32.856 --> 01:01:37.527
Kell can't give you those things, either,
so tell me, Kate, why him?

01:01:38.612 --> 01:01:42.657
Because I've never known anybody
with such a capacity for hate

01:01:42.782 --> 01:01:44.117
except me.

01:01:44.242 --> 01:01:47.412
That's what's kept you
going all these years?

01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:49.039
Hmm?

01:01:51.082 --> 01:01:52.584
Fine.

01:01:54.252 --> 01:01:55.587
Go home, Faith.

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:59.925
Take care of what's important.

01:02:31.706 --> 01:02:33.959
(Wind blows)

01:03:05.824 --> 01:03:08.660
(Thunderclap)

01:03:22.757 --> 01:03:25.093
You were with him.

01:03:27.512 --> 01:03:29.806
A woman is a temple

01:03:29.931 --> 01:03:32.600
built on a sewer.

01:03:33.393 --> 01:03:35.687
(Thunder rumbling)

01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:39.274
Remember what you were
when I first found you.

01:03:41.026 --> 01:03:43.028
A whore.

01:03:44.779 --> 01:03:46.781
Now, look at you.

01:03:47.782 --> 01:03:49.909
A liberated whore.

01:03:50.035 --> 01:03:51.369
Fuck you.

01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:55.081
Oh, we'll get to that, blossom.

01:03:55.206 --> 01:04:00.920
But in the interim, be grateful
I don't take your pretty little face off.

01:04:02.088 --> 01:04:04.758
Hurts, doesn't it...

01:04:06.134 --> 01:04:09.262
...that there is something
you actually can't have?

01:04:10.764 --> 01:04:16.019
Hmm. I can have
anything I want.

01:04:17.687 --> 01:04:19.606
Except me.

01:04:20.315 --> 01:04:22.150
(Sighs)

01:04:22.859 --> 01:04:25.779
I've already had you.

01:04:28.073 --> 01:04:30.742
(Thunder crashing)

01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:32.535
(Softly) Not really.

01:04:36.915 --> 01:04:38.917
Close enough.

01:05:03.858 --> 01:05:06.277
(Door opening)

01:05:27.882 --> 01:05:32.429
(Woman vocalizing)

01:05:35.723 --> 01:05:41.479
(♪ Woman singing)

01:06:57.096 --> 01:06:58.932
Forever.

01:07:34.133 --> 01:07:36.886
May love remain
to guide our way

01:07:37.011 --> 01:07:38.763
till the day we are reborn.

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:46.020
Forgive me.

01:07:47.981 --> 01:07:50.483
(Screams)

01:08:04.247 --> 01:08:05.498
I'm sorry.

01:08:07.333 --> 01:08:09.252
You had no right.

01:08:26.728 --> 01:08:27.729
(Wind blows)

01:08:27.854 --> 01:08:28.854
(Gasps)

01:08:28.979 --> 01:08:30.814
(Thunder)

01:08:32.649 --> 01:08:33.776
(Duncan) Kate?

01:08:33.901 --> 01:08:36.696
No. Don't be frightened.
You're Immortal, we both are.

01:08:36.821 --> 01:08:38.823
Aah!

01:08:41.242 --> 01:08:43.077
I did it for you...

01:08:43.786 --> 01:08:45.287
...for us.

01:08:45.412 --> 01:08:47.790
- Aah!
- Kate.

01:08:47.915 --> 01:08:51.794
- Oh, no!
- Oh, my God! What have I done?

01:08:51.919 --> 01:08:53.421
Kate!

01:08:53.546 --> 01:08:55.798
(Faith) 'You wanted this.'

01:08:55.923 --> 01:08:58.551
You forced it on me.

01:08:59.344 --> 01:09:01.261
I never asked for eternity.

01:09:01.386 --> 01:09:02.889
(Crying)

01:09:03.014 --> 01:09:05.892
(Duncan) 'I never wanted us to be apart.'

01:09:10.063 --> 01:09:12.732
- Would you have really understood?
- Which part?

01:09:12.857 --> 01:09:16.277
The endless, numbing
sameness of it all?

01:09:16.402 --> 01:09:18.613
Or never bothering
to love someone

01:09:19.529 --> 01:09:23.326
because whole lifetimes tick by so fast
they don't even count any more?

01:09:23.451 --> 01:09:25.578
(Opens door)

01:09:26.078 --> 01:09:27.497
Then why did you come?

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:31.709
To see if I could feel again...

01:09:32.542 --> 01:09:34.212
...anything.

01:09:34.962 --> 01:09:36.798
(Door closes)

01:09:46.557 --> 01:09:48.559
(Elevator bell dings)

01:09:52.647 --> 01:09:54.649
You're missing the point, Kate.

01:09:54.774 --> 01:09:57.110
The difference
between Connor and I

01:09:57.235 --> 01:09:58.903
is that as long
as you're still alive,

01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:01.531
there's a chance that one day
I might be forgiven.

01:10:02.407 --> 01:10:03.616
It may take years...

01:10:04.951 --> 01:10:06.703
...centuries, even.

01:10:07.829 --> 01:10:09.789
But at least I can carry
that hope inside me.

01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:13.209
That's one blessing
of immortality...

01:10:15.253 --> 01:10:17.255
...there's always tomorrow.

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:20.133
Even for us.

01:10:26.848 --> 01:10:28.766
(Bell tolling)

01:10:38.693 --> 01:10:41.112
What are you doing, Jin?

01:10:42.071 --> 01:10:43.448
Just thinking.

01:10:45.032 --> 01:10:48.369
(Jin) Men, for the most part,
can mend their ways

01:10:48.494 --> 01:10:51.205
only after they have made
a mistake.

01:10:53.124 --> 01:10:54.459
One day soon,

01:10:55.501 --> 01:11:00.840
we will all serve very little purpose
to Kell, except dead.

01:11:16.522 --> 01:11:17.899
(Kell) A toast.

01:11:20.193 --> 01:11:22.195
I see tonight...

01:11:23.362 --> 01:11:26.199
...as a celebration of the spirit.

01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:29.494
To all of you

01:11:29.619 --> 01:11:33.915
who continue to stand by me
even those who might waver

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:35.875
at times...

01:11:37.168 --> 01:11:40.546
You are my flock.

01:11:42.006 --> 01:11:42.882
You

01:11:43.466 --> 01:11:45.510
nourish my soul.

01:11:49.222 --> 01:11:53.267
You are all a part
of a great journey,

01:11:53.768 --> 01:11:56.604
a 400-year quest...

01:11:58.314 --> 01:12:00.149
...for justice.

01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:05.613
(Kell) And here, my friends,

01:12:05.738 --> 01:12:09.283
is the instrument of that justice.

01:12:10.827 --> 01:12:14.497
The giver and taker
of creation...

01:12:17.166 --> 01:12:19.710
...baptised in blood.

01:12:22.755 --> 01:12:27.343
It is the living
that matters after all.

01:12:32.265 --> 01:12:34.433
It sings like an angel.

01:12:35.893 --> 01:12:37.520
Just listen.

01:12:40.273 --> 01:12:41.858
(Faith gasps)

01:12:46.112 --> 01:12:46.988
(Jin) Uh!

01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:55.162
(Man) Uh!

01:13:03.296 --> 01:13:04.797
(Carlos) Uh!

01:13:04.922 --> 01:13:06.340
(Gasps)

01:13:18.102 --> 01:13:20.104
Till the day we are reborn.

01:13:21.314 --> 01:13:22.648
(Faith gasps)

01:13:31.574 --> 01:13:32.825
Uh!

01:13:40.791 --> 01:13:42.126
Aah!

01:13:43.544 --> 01:13:45.463
Aah!

01:14:01.646 --> 01:14:03.898
(Wind blows)

01:14:17.286 --> 01:14:18.579
Kell.

01:14:20.039 --> 01:14:21.248
Jacob Kell.

01:14:30.091 --> 01:14:31.926
Connor?

01:14:41.602 --> 01:14:43.813
(Sighs)

01:14:43.938 --> 01:14:47.316
We've lived many lives,
you and I.

01:14:47.441 --> 01:14:52.822
We've seen things that most people
could never understand.

01:14:52.947 --> 01:14:55.700
But now what do you see?

01:14:55.825 --> 01:14:58.536
I see someone who would
never kill an unarmed man.

01:15:00.121 --> 01:15:04.500
I also see someone
who has lost hope.

01:15:04.625 --> 01:15:07.336
Life brings hope and pain...

01:15:09.714 --> 01:15:12.425
...but revenge
never brings redemption.

01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:15.553
The path and choice are ours.

01:15:22.643 --> 01:15:24.228
Connor, what the hell's going on?

01:15:25.062 --> 01:15:26.564
I have chosen mine.

01:15:26.689 --> 01:15:27.732
Aah!

01:15:27.857 --> 01:15:29.275
What are you doing?

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:32.570
Kell's too strong,
and he's getting stronger.

01:15:32.695 --> 01:15:35.156
Neither one of us can beat him alone.

01:15:37.116 --> 01:15:38.242
Are you out of your mind?

01:15:40.411 --> 01:15:43.289
If we let him win,
it could mean the end.

01:15:49.170 --> 01:15:50.880
Connor, no!

01:15:53.424 --> 01:15:57.219
Kell is going to kill you, Duncan,
just to torment me,

01:15:57.344 --> 01:16:00.097
and there is nothing
you can do about it, nothing!

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:02.058
I don't believe that, Connor.
Neither should you.

01:16:02.183 --> 01:16:04.852
Alone, neither one of us
can beat him.

01:16:04.977 --> 01:16:06.187
Together, we can.

01:16:06.312 --> 01:16:08.522
You know the rules.

01:16:08.647 --> 01:16:10.649
Only one Immortal
can challenge another.

01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:13.110
And only one will.

01:16:14.111 --> 01:16:15.196
This isn't the answer.

01:16:15.988 --> 01:16:17.198
Listen to me.

01:16:17.323 --> 01:16:18.741
In the end,

01:16:18.866 --> 01:16:23.162
there can be only one,
and that has to be you.

01:16:25.581 --> 01:16:27.083
No.

01:16:27.875 --> 01:16:29.126
We can beat him together.

01:16:29.251 --> 01:16:31.712
Then we are in agreement.

01:16:42.807 --> 01:16:44.809
Enough, Connor!

01:16:44.934 --> 01:16:49.021
I won't fight you.
I will never fight you, Connor.

01:16:49.522 --> 01:16:51.565
Then you die!

01:17:18.050 --> 01:17:20.511
No!
You're not doing this, Connor.

01:17:21.554 --> 01:17:23.931
Oh, yes, we're doing this.

01:17:24.056 --> 01:17:29.145
Every day, every breath we took
was for this end.

01:17:32.565 --> 01:17:35.901
Look inside
and tell me I'm wrong.

01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:57.423
Aah!

01:17:59.383 --> 01:18:01.594
Aah! Aah!

01:18:06.932 --> 01:18:08.934
Do it!

01:18:12.271 --> 01:18:14.273
I can't.

01:18:16.984 --> 01:18:19.153
Remember how
you first found me?

01:18:19.278 --> 01:18:23.616
Sitting in that bloody bog,
scared out of my mind?

01:18:23.741 --> 01:18:26.952
You taught me how to live, Connor.
You taught me why we live.

01:18:28.078 --> 01:18:30.539
Have you forgotten all of that?

01:18:32.458 --> 01:18:33.959
No.

01:18:36.545 --> 01:18:40.049
Our bonds are all
that hold us in this world.

01:18:42.092 --> 01:18:44.094
Don't break this one.

01:18:48.682 --> 01:18:52.603
Please, Connor.
I'm begging you.

01:18:56.357 --> 01:18:58.359
It's too late.

01:19:05.199 --> 01:19:07.660
This has to be done.

01:19:07.785 --> 01:19:09.203
Aah!

01:19:12.248 --> 01:19:13.624
No, Connor!
Not like this!

01:19:13.749 --> 01:19:15.125
Come on, stop!

01:19:15.251 --> 01:19:17.836
- Connor, stop!
- Duncan!

01:19:22.424 --> 01:19:25.094
One of us has to die now,
old friend.

01:19:27.054 --> 01:19:28.555
No.

01:19:30.933 --> 01:19:32.726
And you know it.

01:19:34.812 --> 01:19:36.313
No.

01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:41.610
Goodbye, Duncan...

01:19:42.695 --> 01:19:44.863
...my true brother.

01:19:47.533 --> 01:19:49.785
I love you, Connor.

01:19:59.044 --> 01:20:00.754
Aah!

01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:04.842
No!

01:20:13.767 --> 01:20:15.394
Aah!

01:21:03.484 --> 01:21:06.028
(Screaming)

01:22:30.529 --> 01:22:34.116
(Hands clapping)

01:22:40.914 --> 01:22:42.416
Duncan.

01:22:43.208 --> 01:22:45.210
Well done.

01:22:49.214 --> 01:22:52.676
I ever thought
you had him in you.

01:22:54.678 --> 01:22:58.348
What does it feel like
to kill a brother?

01:22:59.266 --> 01:23:02.853
Feels good,
doesn't it?

01:23:03.979 --> 01:23:06.356
You'll never know, will you?

01:23:08.734 --> 01:23:12.154
Now you'll never have
Connor MacLeod's head.

01:23:13.363 --> 01:23:16.283
Are you going to run?

01:23:16.408 --> 01:23:19.244
Are you going to hide?

01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:23.373
Run?

01:23:23.499 --> 01:23:25.876
(Grunts)

01:23:26.001 --> 01:23:28.212
Brother, come on!

01:23:28.337 --> 01:23:30.547
Aah!

01:23:30.672 --> 01:23:32.007
(Grunts)

01:23:32.132 --> 01:23:34.384
Aah!

01:23:38.096 --> 01:23:41.350
(Both screaming)

01:24:06.542 --> 01:24:08.669
How bad do you want it,
Duncan?

01:24:11.672 --> 01:24:13.090
You'll pay!

01:24:38.156 --> 01:24:40.284
Aah!

01:24:58.135 --> 01:25:00.220
(Screams)

01:25:11.398 --> 01:25:12.608
Duncan!

01:26:33.271 --> 01:26:35.107
(Grunts)

01:26:35.232 --> 01:26:38.902
OK, Kell. Come on.
Let's do this.

01:26:44.866 --> 01:26:46.284
(Camera winding)

01:26:50.038 --> 01:26:51.581
Just watch.

01:27:15.439 --> 01:27:18.108
Merry Christmas.

01:27:39.713 --> 01:27:41.590
A valiant effort, Duncan.

01:27:42.591 --> 01:27:44.551
Too bad.

01:27:44.676 --> 01:27:46.970
And this is just the beginning.

01:27:47.095 --> 01:27:52.225
You see, when you absorbed
Connor's spirit, you inherited his curse.

01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:55.645
Revenge is so sweet.

01:27:55.771 --> 01:27:58.398
I wonder who we'll start with?

01:28:04.404 --> 01:28:05.947
Oh, Kate.

01:28:07.199 --> 01:28:08.950
(Thunder)

01:28:09.075 --> 01:28:10.243
(Whispering) 'Forever.'

01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:13.705
Oh, God.

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:16.124
Kell!

01:28:18.084 --> 01:28:20.378
Jacob Kell!

01:28:22.672 --> 01:28:27.344
Revenge will never
bring you redemption,

01:28:27.469 --> 01:28:30.055
so I'm going to do it for you.

01:28:31.389 --> 01:28:33.141
Aah!

01:28:35.936 --> 01:28:37.938
Is that all you've got?

01:28:46.988 --> 01:28:50.450
(Kell) Duncan, I'd thought
I'd be home for dinner an hour ago,

01:28:50.575 --> 01:28:52.494
but this is very impressive.

01:28:54.246 --> 01:28:57.666
Come on.
What are you waiting for?

01:28:57.791 --> 01:28:59.543
I'd be delighted.
Yah!

01:29:12.013 --> 01:29:15.308
Impressive... isn't it?

01:29:15.433 --> 01:29:16.935
Uh!

01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:17.978
Duncan!

01:29:18.103 --> 01:29:20.188
(Drops sword)

01:29:23.984 --> 01:29:26.653
You see at last your fate!

01:29:27.571 --> 01:29:30.699
Yes!
Because this game is done!

01:29:34.744 --> 01:29:36.413
Uh!

01:29:39.165 --> 01:29:40.876
Well, look on the bright side.

01:29:41.001 --> 01:29:43.336
At least
you went down swinging.

01:29:43.461 --> 01:29:44.963
(Connor's voice) 'Jacob Kell.

01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:49.593

01:30:05.817 --> 01:30:07.944
...there can be only one.

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:21.374
(Connor's voice) 'And you're not it.'

01:30:23.293 --> 01:30:24.794
Call ya.

01:30:46.524 --> 01:30:48.526
No!

01:30:50.487 --> 01:30:52.405
(Screaming)

01:30:54.741 --> 01:30:56.409

my friend.
