01:26.360 --> 01:28.377
<i> What a bunch of nonsense. </ i></i>

01:28.378 --> 01:30.656
- Mimi.
- Patrick.

01:30.657 --> 01:32.088
That's all I need, Mimi.

01:32.089 --> 01:34.110
New beginning
new opportunities.

01:34.145 --> 01:36.489
I know, for both.

01:38.246 --> 01:40.211
Come on, we'll be late.

01:42.188 --> 01:46.181
A Patrick was offered a
business opportunity in Ireland.

01:46.182 --> 01:48.664
Nightclubs,
two in Belfast, one in Lisburn.

01:48.665 --> 01:50.822
I have always rejected
that offer, because ...

01:50.823 --> 01:52.569
... This means relocating.

01:52.570 --> 01:56.762
- We want to continue life apart.
- This divorce is not required.

01:58.024 --> 02:02.032
As you see,
This wedding certificate is false.

02:03.675 --> 02:05.254
What?

02:05.255 --> 02:07.603
<i> not what is written
on paper. </ i></i>

02:07.604 --> 02:10.984
But we signed in the church,
with Father Jim.

02:10.985 --> 02:12.794
There's the rub.

02:12.795 --> 02:15.233
<i> Come here, stupid bastard! </ i></i>

02:19.306 --> 02:22.236
"Jim's father was not a Father?

02:22.237 --> 02:25.004
- According to Interpol, no.
- And that means ...

02:25.005 --> 02:29.534
You can not be divorced,

02:30.361 --> 02:32.883
because they were never married.

02:32.884 --> 02:34.909
What?

02:35.342 --> 02:38.201
Carl <i> call me as soon
as you can. </ i></i>

02:40.017 --> 02:43.486
Why did you get, Stella takes
nap and we are backward.

02:43.487 --> 02:44.996
- Where?
- The book club.

02:44.997 --> 02:47.325
Damn.
How late?

02:47.326 --> 02:50.539
Willy Wonka is on TV
at 5, she loves it.

02:50.540 --> 02:55.928
And if you behave yourself, you can return
unless you buy something as a gift.

02:55.929 --> 03:00.644
Just give me a few pounds
I have not smoked in nearly three hours.

03:01.316 --> 03:04.145
- Tell him you're not a milk cow.
- Do not mess.

03:04.146 --> 03:05.527
I order up
let dry!

03:05.528 --> 03:08.025
I bet she has
money saved.

03:08.026 --> 03:10.908
I will not steal from my mother
to feed your addiction.

03:10.909 --> 03:14.285
so we can see how you
improved without your drugs.

03:16.438 --> 03:18.381
<i> Stella is sleeping. </ i></i>

03:21.395 --> 03:25.118
In the eyes of God I'm not
more than a vile whore!

03:25.119 --> 03:27.191
What about Mandy and Fergal?

03:27.192 --> 03:29.932
They have access denied
at the gates of heaven!

03:29.933 --> 03:33.791
They were trapped in purgatory
forever! Whose fault is it?

03:33.792 --> 03:36.409
The idiot who put on a cassock
and posed as a priest.

03:36.410 --> 03:38.254
Wrong answer.

03:38.255 --> 03:40.193
It's your fault!

03:40.194 --> 03:41.525
What?

03:42.216 --> 03:45.687
Even clean up
my own ass with this.

03:49.742 --> 03:51.429
Get out!

03:52.405 --> 03:54.534
Where did you get <i> Father Jim </ i></i>

03:54.535 --> 03:56.807
<i> can not remember
was a friend of the clan, </ i></i>

03:56.808 --> 03:58.841
<i> was in a hurry,
you made me hurry. </ i></i>

03:58.842 --> 04:03.049
Because <i> wanted to walk down the aisle
in my third trimester. So I did. </ I></i>

04:05.411 --> 04:07.387
<i> You did it on purpose. </ i></i>

04:07.388 --> 04:09.172
Are you kidding?
How are supposed to know?

04:09.173 --> 04:11.700
Now it all makes sense

04:11.701 --> 04:14.925
I thought it was cheating
to get married,

04:14.926 --> 04:18.937
so you took any fraud,
just to shut me up.

04:18.938 --> 04:22.100
And the children ...
all are bastards ...

04:22.101 --> 04:24.043
Please tell me something I do not know.

04:26.745 --> 04:29.314
<i> - We must re-marry.
- What? </ I></i>

04:29.315 --> 04:31.752
- We must re-marry.
- No, no.

04:31.753 --> 04:33.746
You wanted this divorce,

04:33.747 --> 04:37.180
and because of you, we were
married first.

04:41.876 --> 04:46.311
Now we will do as intended,
for the sake of children,

04:46.312 --> 04:49.396
one must know this,

04:49.397 --> 04:52.187
so far everyone
the divorce became final,

04:52.188 --> 04:55.741
and we are happy as worms.

04:56.278 --> 05:01.109
- See you tonight to fix it.
- Speaking of being friendly.

05:03.000 --> 05:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here

05:10.267 --> 05:12.012
- Hello everyone!
- Hi, Dad!

05:12.441 --> 05:16.079
I'm on top of the world, son!
It's official, I am a free man.

05:16.816 --> 05:20.709
But the most important ...
I am a free woman.

05:22.646 --> 05:24.646
Are you okay?

05:24.647 --> 05:27.520
I was just thinking.

05:27.521 --> 05:31.425
- Is not as if they separate?
- It is no separation

05:31.426 --> 05:34.593
is that now we are all orphans.

06:07.182 --> 06:08.510
Damn!

06:08.511 --> 06:11.495
- Are you okay?
- I've never felt better.

06:11.496 --> 06:13.679
I even got
an appointment with someone.

06:13.680 --> 06:16.583
How nice! Can you tell
Who's the lucky?

06:16.584 --> 06:19.605
I met him last week
the food section of Tosca.

06:19.606 --> 06:22.692
- And how is it?
- Damn beautiful.

06:22.693 --> 06:27.114
- What is your name?
- Jack Beam.

06:41.102 --> 06:43.149
I do not think <i> ...!</ i></i>

06:43.150 --> 06:44.929
<i> Really!
That's what he said </ i></i>

06:55.404 --> 06:59.119
It is understandable that you feel
bad for your parents you know?

06:59.120 --> 07:01.897
They used to go every Sunday.

07:01.898 --> 07:04.517
He was never in the week,
Sunday was the only day that was.

07:05.079 --> 07:07.812
Although only read one book,
did not matter,

07:07.813 --> 07:10.214
while we were
everyone at the table.

07:10.891 --> 07:12.682
My favorite moment of the week.

07:12.683 --> 07:14.496
Some people
were never yours.

07:14.497 --> 07:17.424
That's life,
is what families do.

07:17.425 --> 07:19.990
What good it that way,
if the family is going to collapse?

07:19.991 --> 07:21.343
You can not say that.

07:21.860 --> 07:23.034
Yes I can.

07:23.035 --> 07:25.615
Why look for partner
if everything is going to go to hell?

07:25.616 --> 07:28.630
I'll spare you the problem,
I'll stay single.

07:36.786 --> 07:38.689
- Come, let's go.
- What?

07:38.690 --> 07:40.584
Do not argue, just arréglate.

08:01.419 --> 08:05.471
<i> Do not worry, your brother again
soon. Dad did not take, darling. </ I></i>

08:42.403 --> 08:45.356
- Come to midnight or you will be punished.
- Much cleavage?

08:45.357 --> 08:48.395
Are you kidding!
You can never have too much cleavage.

08:49.811 --> 08:52.098
I beg to differ.

08:52.099 --> 08:53.898
See you later.

08:57.406 --> 09:01.555
Shane, come on in the house
Dad, boys night.

09:11.214 --> 09:12.717
But ... What the hell?

09:19.101 --> 09:20.682
For you Dad.

09:20.683 --> 09:23.827
Celebrate everything Dad!

09:25.081 --> 09:26.595
INCOMING CALL ...
MIMI

09:30.273 --> 09:31.374
Salud!

09:37.091 --> 09:39.297
What the hell are we celebrating?

09:52.999 --> 09:55.433
- Rosalita?
- No.

09:55.434 --> 09:57.414
Okay,
agree, I know.

09:57.415 --> 10:00.972
The wig, before you say it,
my hair is dead.

10:00.973 --> 10:03.305
But I prefer to use
the word "short."

10:03.306 --> 10:04.799
I'm not Rosalita.

10:04.800 --> 10:09.259
I removed a few years off. He feared that
telling the truth, not coming.

10:11.060 --> 10:13.372
I added a few inches
my height.

10:13.692 --> 10:16.321
What do you think?
Enough good for Tom Cruise?

10:16.322 --> 10:17.721
Excuse me?

10:17.722 --> 10:19.512
I!
Herbert!

10:19.513 --> 10:21.738
I'm not Rosalita,

10:21.739 --> 10:24.892
and never be Rosalita,
Do you understand that?

10:24.893 --> 10:30.747
Now, do me a favor, you piece of garbage,
go, although I prefer the phrase ...

10:30.748 --> 10:32.082
Get out of here!

10:58.871 --> 11:01.573
"Herbert?
Rosalita!

11:03.298 --> 11:07.017
Nice to meet Rosalita,
but I am not Herbert.

11:07.018 --> 11:11.469
But you can be, do not tell me
I also abandoned.

11:11.470 --> 11:14.300
- Something like that.
- Let me buy you a drink.

11:15.469 --> 11:17.799
Are you gay?

11:19.424 --> 11:20.402
Married?

11:22.592 --> 11:25.675
- I should know.
- Actually ... no.

11:25.676 --> 11:27.210
Ever.

11:28.633 --> 11:30.432
IDIOT!

11:30.433 --> 11:32.925
So ...
What is the problem?

11:34.815 --> 11:38.696
None, sweet, usually it's just that
'm the one who pays for the drinks.

11:41.197 --> 11:43.530
- What would you like?
- Lemon Vodka, please.

11:43.531 --> 11:45.306
- Double?
- Why not?

12:01.810 --> 12:03.366
<i> I'll take care of this ...</ i></i>

12:04.310 --> 12:08.005
<i> Sorry, remind me of someone
I saw ten seconds, </ i></i>

12:08.006 --> 12:10.742
<i> was about to tell you
not come here very often. </ i></i>

12:13.071 --> 12:15.435
I see you prefer <i>
a humorous angle. </ i></i>

12:15.436 --> 12:19.533
<i> If this bar was a market
meat, you'd be first. </ i></i>

12:19.852 --> 12:21.533
<i> That's no fun. </ i></i>

12:24.205 --> 12:26.438
<i> In fact, someone told me that once. </ i></i>

12:26.439 --> 12:30.296
<i> - Really?
- For my life, a complete idiot. </ I></i>

12:33.104 --> 12:34.702
<i> I'm Gary. </ i></i>

12:40.851 --> 12:42.483
<i> Pasa. </ i></i>

12:44.962 --> 12:47.995
There is beer in the fridge.
Help yourself.

12:58.493 --> 13:00.163
<i> I made it myself. </ i></i>

13:00.164 --> 13:03.594
- What?
- This place, I did it myself.

13:05.322 --> 13:06.778
Lindo.

13:11.765 --> 13:15.117
- I am an architect.
- Yes?

13:15.118 --> 13:17.256
What are you?

13:17.257 --> 13:19.778
- I have my own company.
- What are you doing?

13:19.779 --> 13:22.625
Credit Control,
gaining in the market,

13:22.626 --> 13:25.133
big rewards
after loans

13:25.134 --> 13:28.151
Can be a bit ruthless,
but I love it.

13:28.152 --> 13:31.724
- I can see it.
- They said it badly in my life

13:32.260 --> 13:34.481
but I showed them
they were wrong.

13:35.244 --> 13:36.166
That's ...

13:36.167 --> 13:38.306
Go away damn <i> </ i></i>

13:40.087 --> 13:41.194
Bitch <i> ...</ i></i>

13:42.525 --> 13:44.260
A man with ambition.

13:47.642 --> 13:50.776
- What do you like?
- Just to start ...

13:50.777 --> 13:54.497
something casual, some positions,
I prefer the 69 ...

13:54.498 --> 13:57.376
I do not usually like
penetration in the first date

13:57.377 --> 14:00.843
unless anal
with bellows. If it seems.

14:00.844 --> 14:02.538
He talked about music.

14:12.145 --> 14:13.854
Hello, Frank!

14:14.325 --> 14:15.513
"Toast?

14:17.637 --> 14:19.043
Yes ..

14:21.588 --> 14:23.488
If you do not mind ...

14:23.489 --> 14:26.719
No hassle ...

14:32.742 --> 14:35.523
I think not, darling!

14:36.734 --> 14:40.199
No hassle ...

14:50.492 --> 14:53.043
- How dare you?
- Damn old!

14:53.044 --> 14:56.917
Do you think Libby would give you another chance
if I knew you stole my savings?

14:56.918 --> 15:00.554
And what about you?
Your benefits last for 10 years.

15:01.770 --> 15:03.069
Return it!

15:04.435 --> 15:07.856
"You're never satisfied, woman?
You're a cad.

15:07.857 --> 15:11.680
You'd be screwed if not for me
would be in the street homeless.

15:12.444 --> 15:14.647
That does not entitle you
to take my money.

15:14.648 --> 15:19.615
Of course, otherwise
would you spend your money in nursing homes.

15:19.616 --> 15:24.178
I am your financier ...

15:24.179 --> 15:27.918
so all the money is mine.

15:27.919 --> 15:29.642
Do you understand?

15:39.593 --> 15:42.559
This is your idea
revenge right?

15:42.560 --> 15:45.817
Do not be reached to ruin
our first marriage,

15:45.818 --> 15:48.066
but they also want
fuck this one.

15:48.067 --> 15:50.115
Am I distracted?

15:52.085 --> 15:56.669
Father Tony, a priest legitimate
is testing his church

15:56.670 --> 15:59.209
and told us
maybe we could help.

16:00.241 --> 16:03.812
If you want to fix things
meet me there at noon.

16:06.317 --> 16:08.343
Come on, move!

16:10.761 --> 16:13.464
Mimi ... Rosalita.
Rosalita ... Mimi.

16:15.111 --> 16:17.785
Do not be late,
Leaving the dog at home.

16:23.847 --> 16:25.552
I will be frank with you,

16:25.553 --> 16:27.657
I can not.

16:27.658 --> 16:29.879
It goes against what I represent,
Mimi. You know.

16:29.880 --> 16:32.751
God does not care.
Would you mind?

16:32.752 --> 16:36.145
I understand what it means for you
but my blessing

16:36.146 --> 16:38.078
will not undo the fact that
their children are illegitimate.

16:38.079 --> 16:40.149
With respect father, did not come
to give us a sermon.

16:40.150 --> 16:42.821
- Shut up! "
- It's supposed to be religious,

16:42.822 --> 16:46.086
an ambassador of goodwill?
go hoax.

16:46.087 --> 16:49.913
- You can not say in church hoax.
- I can say that I can think of.

16:49.914 --> 16:52.437
Help would not hurt, does it?

16:54.726 --> 16:58.630
Let the point, right?
We know everything about you.

16:58.631 --> 17:01.944
- Obvio!
- May you curse the people,

17:01.945 --> 17:04.483
does not mean
you can curse God.

17:04.484 --> 17:07.546
- Not so, amigo.
- Who do you call a friend?

17:07.547 --> 17:10.193
- I'm not afraid.
- It's because he is afraid of God ...

17:10.194 --> 17:11.976
Paddy!

17:14.172 --> 17:17.986
And to think that someone would dress well
to mount a mockery, hypocrisy.

17:17.987 --> 17:19.874
Not your fault!

17:23.432 --> 17:25.425
Must go.

17:27.048 --> 17:28.320
Now!

17:30.165 --> 17:32.344
I had to abort when
I had the opportunity

17:32.345 --> 17:35.038
are not made to be a father.

17:36.043 --> 17:39.838
Sorry Jesus, was not seriously
what I said abortion,

17:39.839 --> 17:42.462
would have 100 sons.

17:42.463 --> 17:44.700
Say ten Hail Mary.

17:59.643 --> 18:01.895
Can not you stay for breakfast
hot lips?

18:01.896 --> 18:03.815
Any reason?

18:04.689 --> 18:06.723
I like you.

18:09.089 --> 18:11.687
Me too I like you,
if you want to know.

18:13.403 --> 18:16.167
You could at least leave your number.

18:16.168 --> 18:19.827
"To be reviewing the phone
and wondering why I did not call?

18:19.828 --> 18:22.107
That's not my style.

18:25.451 --> 18:29.373
You call me, then.
Later.

18:32.230 --> 18:36.101
Let's go for a drink.
Nothing hard.

18:52.757 --> 18:55.619
Sorry for being late.
I was with a pretty girl.

18:55.620 --> 18:57.363
Than good.
What is your name?

18:57.364 --> 19:02.418
Right. The Raylies, my friends
say they have problems.

19:02.419 --> 19:07.625
New people are stuck in their way,
we will pay for delete.

19:09.451 --> 19:11.183
What?

19:11.184 --> 19:13.134
We already know.

19:13.135 --> 19:14.382
We're on it.

19:14.383 --> 19:16.451
It was for mom
wants to make sure ...

19:16.452 --> 19:18.451
handle your business part
from now on.

19:18.452 --> 19:20.583
What about my contacts?

19:20.584 --> 19:22.606
But you will go, right?

19:24.955 --> 19:27.687
- Anything else?
- Not at the moment.

19:28.261 --> 19:30.973
Well, we go.

19:47.778 --> 19:51.922
<i> Hello, wanted to know, if you were still
interested in that drink, </ i></i>

19:51.923 --> 19:55.320
<i> you know, just a drink, nothing more,
you decide, I am willing. </ i></i>

19:56.914 --> 19:59.052
But listen, if you're busy
there is no rush.

19:59.053 --> 20:02.094
I have also plans
you know how ...

20:04.650 --> 20:08.233
like going to the doctor,
not have herpes or something

20:08.234 --> 20:11.765
is routine checkup every six months ...

20:26.778 --> 20:30.008
These bells are
everything seem real.

20:30.009 --> 20:33.327
That is all that was our
marriage, a fiction.

20:35.769 --> 20:37.930
Was it real for us.

20:42.495 --> 20:47.358
Tell him you have two days, when not
then, he's going to get ugly.

20:47.961 --> 20:49.568
Well ...

20:55.705 --> 20:58.293
I told you
I wanted out on Wednesday.

20:58.294 --> 21:00.302
Did you do the funny or what?

21:02.330 --> 21:04.901
Since when did architects
make hamburgers?

21:04.902 --> 21:08.873
Have you ever loved me or you married
me because it was "right"?

21:08.874 --> 21:12.565
- Of course I loved you.
- Why Ireland?

21:12.566 --> 21:14.722
- Business.
- Or pleasure?

21:15.035 --> 21:18.155
You were at home sluts
when he was not right?

21:18.156 --> 21:22.000
I just wanted to impress ...
Perhaps this is your credit control?

21:23.426 --> 21:27.629
- Actually, yes.
- Let's be honest,

21:27.630 --> 21:30.634
I do not receive payment
until next week.

21:31.452 --> 21:34.362
So he used me
with all your lies.

21:34.363 --> 21:36.334
Arlene is the damn right?

21:36.335 --> 21:38.557
"Arlene?
"The premium Arlene?

21:38.558 --> 21:40.734
Were spending a long time
on business trips,

21:40.735 --> 21:43.145
you were not for the birth
none of our children.

21:43.146 --> 21:45.692
So you could have a second family.

21:45.693 --> 21:47.547
You lost your mind, woman.

21:47.548 --> 21:49.221
Now you know everything.

21:49.623 --> 21:51.668
I have no more secrets.

21:51.669 --> 21:53.544
<i> Micky </ i></i>

21:55.897 --> 21:59.376
If my brother's bastard
finds out, will kill you.

21:59.858 --> 22:02.113
Can not tell
you know me?

22:02.767 --> 22:05.152
- But ...
- It's a secret!

22:07.292 --> 22:10.165
So I'm not the only
with a secret.

22:14.736 --> 22:18.297
<i> I gave him 48 hours
should come out quite right. </ i></i>

22:27.355 --> 22:29.897
You better find
a priest marry us,

22:29.898 --> 22:32.086
to divorce,

22:32.087 --> 22:35.830
because if I have to be me
which he sought,

22:35.831 --> 22:39.968
I will grind you to a pulp
prior to take you to Ireland.

22:50.402 --> 22:52.837
I did not think you would see.

22:54.505 --> 22:56.193
Look, panic ...

22:56.194 --> 22:59.920
A box of chocolates or flowers
had not been too bad.

23:03.265 --> 23:06.172
Why do not you tell me,
Mr Maguire?

23:07.410 --> 23:09.261
Does that matter?

23:09.262 --> 23:11.271
No.

23:11.647 --> 23:13.251
For nothing.

23:15.747 --> 23:18.932
- Then do not care what the ...
- What? Is this ...?

23:20.776 --> 23:23.547
Can I have another
later, if you like.

23:25.741 --> 23:27.681
"We remain engaged?

23:27.682 --> 23:32.233
Sure, I'm sleeping
with Paddy Maguire.

23:41.885 --> 23:46.014
Just promise me
you will keep this ...

23:46.015 --> 23:48.968
... Under the water, right?

23:55.147 --> 23:57.413
- Paddy?
- Yes?

23:59.085 --> 24:02.591
When you return my brother
I will be homeless.

24:03.427 --> 24:06.480
He asked if I could
stay with you.

24:09.718 --> 24:12.466
I know that we
little time together.

24:12.467 --> 24:14.760
But it need not be very formal.

24:16.246 --> 24:19.756
Just think I'll stay
on the couch.

24:19.757 --> 24:22.114
But you'll be in my bed?

24:22.115 --> 24:24.489
Yes!
What do you think?

24:25.546 --> 24:29.167
- I thought we just had fun.
- Yes, right?

24:31.364 --> 24:34.460
- Yes ..
- So ...

24:34.461 --> 24:38.967
... Let me stay at your house,
then, to keep it that way ...

24:40.318 --> 24:42.913
Why change?

24:47.415 --> 24:50.250
I'm sleeping <i>
Paddy Maguire with ...</ i></i>

25:03.757 --> 25:05.505
Why the long face?

25:06.565 --> 25:08.671
Not much ...

25:09.331 --> 25:14.924
Only I feel it is too late
to fix things.

25:14.925 --> 25:18.191
Son, I tell you, never too late
to fix things.

25:19.451 --> 25:21.734
And you and Mom?

25:23.357 --> 25:26.723
I know what I did was wrong and I live
sorry, but what I can do?

25:27.203 --> 25:30.039
Do me harm?
What would that do?

25:30.040 --> 25:33.468
I have a life to live.
And I have to work it.

25:36.569 --> 25:38.211
"And you regret?

25:38.817 --> 25:40.581
What mom?

25:42.446 --> 25:44.421
That I'll never
be sorry, son.

25:57.985 --> 26:00.462
Where is the damn fire?

26:00.463 --> 26:03.348
- Civil registration has a space.
- When?

26:03.349 --> 26:04.860
Today at 4:00.

26:07.650 --> 26:08.646
He was helping me.

26:08.647 --> 26:09.987
<i> - Listen!
- Well, well! </ I></i>

26:09.988 --> 26:12.570
What exactly <i>
what can I do? </ i></i>

26:13.051 --> 26:15.953
- I'll be there when you arrive at the altar.
- It will be the godfather.

26:15.954 --> 26:17.686
I will be the maid of honor.

26:18.537 --> 26:21.573
Well, you better start
to do this crap.

26:22.187 --> 26:24.146
Get ready to go.

26:25.412 --> 26:27.880
"Civil registry?

26:28.159 --> 26:30.798
I did my best
with so little time.

26:32.800 --> 26:35.065
But we are religious.

26:35.979 --> 26:38.811
<i> Patrick, please!
Patrick </ i></i>

26:41.408 --> 26:44.023
We do it or not.
It's your decision.

26:45.124 --> 26:50.296
<i> I know what I earn with this.
It believed that my faith suspended. </ I></i>

26:50.297 --> 26:53.801
I acobardaré <i>.
We'll get married, </ i></i>

26:53.802 --> 26:59.784
<i> today at 4:00.
Like it or not, and you'll understand. </ I></i>

27:23.856 --> 27:26.859
- Excuse me!
- I do not do so.

27:26.860 --> 27:28.393
What?

27:28.394 --> 27:30.691
Would you mind ...?

27:34.602 --> 27:36.086
So?

27:44.845 --> 27:46.240
Tonny Barton.

27:46.241 --> 27:47.822
Remember?

27:48.572 --> 27:51.723
I knew from
you were a brat.

27:51.724 --> 27:55.343
He was given four months of life,
poor bastard.

27:55.344 --> 27:59.281
Wine, I associated with your account

27:59.282 --> 28:01.531
as he is concerned,
still alive.

28:01.532 --> 28:06.972
The system did not help when
your father left me and left us alone

28:08.429 --> 28:10.740
I do this for you and me.

28:10.741 --> 28:14.539
Who do you think was paying
your medication all these years?

28:15.676 --> 28:19.021
It's my revenge.
You understand that?

28:20.029 --> 28:23.563
Frank did not make it worse.
He deserved it.

28:25.415 --> 28:27.282
What did I do to save you.

28:27.283 --> 28:30.624
- What?
- From the gossip!

28:30.802 --> 28:33.812
When you gonna realize
he is the man I love?

28:33.813 --> 28:38.724
You love your family.
Even you, stop complaining.

28:40.518 --> 28:43.165
Liam, your father was arrested.

28:43.166 --> 28:45.937
I know. Carl told me. "
See ya.

28:49.987 --> 28:52.987
I need money to pay
his bond, mother. Where?

28:52.988 --> 28:55.408
Where is the money?

28:56.432 --> 28:58.687
Over my dead body!

29:01.499 --> 29:04.052
She just does not want
me to be happy.

29:04.053 --> 29:07.266
Siempre! I do not know what
what happens.

29:07.267 --> 29:09.775
Well, we could put
in a nursing home.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.063
You know, or euthanasia.

29:13.363 --> 29:17.213
When you pay my bail me out,
that is what you will.

29:19.337 --> 29:22.277
- We can not make bail.
- What?

29:23.403 --> 29:27.177
No! I'll put in prison
if you can not pay!

29:27.178 --> 29:30.773
I can not be prison!
Do not know how that is!

29:32.788 --> 29:37.653
Well, look, your mother has money
hidden somewhere.

29:37.654 --> 29:39.621
Find it.
Just get me out of here.

29:39.622 --> 29:43.143
I'll see what I can do but can
need a little time.

29:44.887 --> 29:47.914
Time! Mine is running out!
You know what?

29:47.915 --> 29:52.290
Transferred to a dangerous internal
my cell before his trial.

29:52.291 --> 29:56.798
Bugler called or Burger, or something,

29:56.799 --> 29:59.340
their last five companions
cell ...

29:59.341 --> 30:03.059
if not leaving here,
I will be number 6.

30:08.168 --> 30:11.538
Crisis. Mom is home today.
I heard her say that.

30:11.539 --> 30:14.056
- What?
- Who?

30:14.057 --> 30:18.163
- With the new type.
- Is the supermarket? Jack Beam.

30:18.629 --> 30:20.589
It's only been out a couple of days.

30:20.590 --> 30:22.321
I do not even have known.

30:22.322 --> 30:24.409
- Are you playing?
- It's out of spite.

30:24.410 --> 30:26.946
- What did Dad?
- Well, it was not very pleased.

30:26.947 --> 30:29.806
It's not really your problem,
are now divorced.

30:29.807 --> 30:32.745
- What is and can still lose.
- What makes you think so?

30:32.746 --> 30:35.706
Apart from the fact that he never
you left your mother's breast.

30:37.945 --> 30:39.860
Something he said, in fact.

30:40.217 --> 30:44.142
He got all sensitive
and blurred her eyes,

30:44.143 --> 30:47.313
We have to stop,
for both mom and dad.

30:47.314 --> 30:49.471
Must commit
their own mistakes, Mickey.

30:49.472 --> 30:52.404
- It's been a week, Karen.
- This means that mom gets married again

30:52.405 --> 30:54.745
after a week
is more than a simple error.

30:54.746 --> 30:56.863
Who is this guy?
Where do you live?

31:10.122 --> 31:11.321
Beautiful?

31:21.883 --> 31:22.903
Ready?

31:33.031 --> 31:34.287
Is this the last?

31:35.396 --> 31:36.710
That's right.

31:39.382 --> 31:42.232
- Damn, did not pass the page.
- Damn!

31:42.233 --> 31:43.913
Damn!

31:43.914 --> 31:46.654
We only have one option.
Go!

31:48.895 --> 31:52.993
Love ... is patient.
Love is kind and not jealous.

31:52.994 --> 31:55.964
Love is not presumptuous
or arrogant.

31:55.965 --> 31:59.190
- Did you choose this fool?
- Damn ...

32:01.661 --> 32:06.439
<i> Love enjoys no injustice.
Love rejoices with the truth. </ I></i>

32:12.548 --> 32:15.312
<i> Love endures all things. </ i></i>

32:15.313 --> 32:19.388
Love is not provoked,
does not take into account a wrong suffered ...

32:19.389 --> 32:21.142
<i> Wait!
No! </ I></i>

32:22.362 --> 32:24.181
- Mom?
- Dad?

32:24.881 --> 32:26.880
Look, I'm sorry
not what you ...

32:30.945 --> 32:34.121
I love his mother.
I could not let go.

32:34.122 --> 32:35.632
We ...

32:36.702 --> 32:38.575
both tasks
big mistakes, but ...

32:38.576 --> 32:42.967
I think I speak for everyone,
When I say "thanks."

32:46.240 --> 32:49.889
This is a happy time
of my life, our lives.

32:51.510 --> 32:53.268
I love you, Mimi.

32:56.118 --> 32:57.470
Sorry.

32:58.092 --> 33:00.551
Now declare
husband and wife.

33:21.293 --> 33:24.711
Do you think that because Frank is not here
things will return to be like before?

33:25.161 --> 33:26.754
It will not happen!

33:55.670 --> 33:57.826
I can go ...
Thanks!

35:03.369 --> 35:07.645
I know my son and I know when
is distracted by something.

35:07.646 --> 35:10.475
Why not invite
to come to tea?

35:12.157 --> 35:14.759
By God, Mickey,
is not vegetarian, do you?

35:14.760 --> 35:16.619
No. ..

35:16.620 --> 35:19.877
- Have you told her you love her?
- No. ..

35:19.878 --> 35:24.624
- Then it's time to do so.
- Ruins everything by telling lies.

35:24.625 --> 35:27.122
Does she believe?

35:27.719 --> 35:31.557
If you want the relationship to work,
tell the truth.

35:31.558 --> 35:34.632
Is the only basis
for a solid future.

35:34.633 --> 35:37.373
She must love you
for who you are.

35:41.931 --> 35:44.814
<i> Hey everyone!
I think probably ...</ i></i>

35:44.815 --> 35:47.867
... It is time for the happy couple

35:47.868 --> 35:50.042
Yes! They can share
his old room back!

36:09.249 --> 36:12.682
<i> - My ass hurts.
- Do not ruin the moment. </ I></i>

36:13.051 --> 36:15.862
- Are we going to leave soon for this?
- Do not know.

36:15.863 --> 36:20.305
- You should have told the truth.
- What? True ... children.

36:20.306 --> 36:22.435
We discovered that our marriage <i>
was not true, </ i></i>

36:22.436 --> 36:24.573
<i> get married again
for you to be legitimized. </ i></i>

36:24.574 --> 36:26.494
<i> know that I was with that girl. </ i></i>

36:26.495 --> 36:29.733
Nothing has changed ...
I still want a divorce.

36:30.198 --> 36:31.343
Agreed.

36:31.344 --> 36:33.834
<i> Like, I'll go tomorrow. </ i></i>

36:45.149 --> 36:47.664
<i> You will not believe this.
Just called. </ I></i>

36:47.665 --> 36:50.217
Remember that type <i>
the burger stand </ i></i>

36:50.218 --> 36:53.984
<i> has told people
Paddy Maguire goes to bed with. </ i></i>

36:56.321 --> 36:57.958
<i> Fucking asshole! </ i></i>

37:06.060 --> 37:09.657
- How could you betray me?
- I had no choice.

37:09.658 --> 37:11.218
Just tell me where is the money ...

37:11.219 --> 37:14.406
... And pay your deposit.
It's that simple.

37:14.407 --> 37:16.979
Over my dead body.

37:19.833 --> 37:23.637
At the base ...
my dresser.

37:26.333 --> 37:27.739
"Libby?

37:28.231 --> 37:29.901
Libby!

37:43.867 --> 37:45.557
By God!

37:47.209 --> 37:49.184
Our sacred stone.

37:52.449 --> 37:55.662
Take that in your pocket
for two years, you know?

37:59.056 --> 38:01.448
I have something to confess.

38:01.449 --> 38:04.523
Not the coast.

38:05.233 --> 38:07.624
A Shane is stuck
true in the nose,

38:07.625 --> 38:09.741
while you were
Travel in Belfast.

38:10.303 --> 38:12.241
To not know ...

38:13.048 --> 38:16.865
I asked Jamie to get us
another stone getting back.

38:18.460 --> 38:22.015
So I walked loading
this in my pocket for anything.

38:24.626 --> 38:26.944
Do not let this wash,
Remember?

38:26.945 --> 38:28.430
By God ...

38:28.431 --> 38:32.257
My tears ...
wanted to save my tears.

38:32.258 --> 38:34.048
The day Lennon was shot.

38:34.049 --> 38:35.987
No tube nothing to do with Lennon.

38:37.562 --> 38:40.738
Our Jamie said his first
word that day ... "Mom."

38:40.739 --> 38:42.584
His first word was Daddy.

38:46.175 --> 38:48.640
The first word
Mandy was Dad.

38:53.037 --> 38:54.671
<i> - Thanks friend.
- See ya. </ I></i>

38:58.320 --> 39:00.624
Do you feel good going to bed
with the head of Chatsworth?

39:01.410 --> 39:04.829
He is noted for all!
I said I keep a secret!

39:06.983 --> 39:08.186
Paddy, listen ...

39:09.923 --> 39:11.863
I'm not Paddy Maguire!
Yes?

39:11.864 --> 39:14.393
- What?
- I'm tired of lies!

39:14.394 --> 39:17.161
Mine, yours,
those of everyone else!

39:17.162 --> 39:19.398
Not worth it!

39:20.329 --> 39:22.188
Want to know the truth?

39:22.189 --> 39:25.480
I'm a fool with slippers
tale!

39:25.481 --> 39:27.150
I was under the toenails!

39:27.151 --> 39:29.122
I like the pervert!
No!

39:29.123 --> 39:32.584
Amo, so pervert!

39:32.585 --> 39:35.515
And had a dog
me the suck!

39:37.051 --> 39:39.745
So you want to go out?

39:39.746 --> 39:41.617
Are not you Paddy?

39:41.618 --> 39:43.343
I am not.

39:45.989 --> 39:49.964
Remove this car for
midnight or skinning you!

40:16.937 --> 40:18.866
What is it?

40:20.770 --> 40:22.852
All these are hers.

40:30.217 --> 40:32.618
We did well.

40:32.953 --> 40:35.794
- I know love.
- Must be this ...

40:36.824 --> 40:39.766
- We were one big family.
- We are ...

40:39.767 --> 40:42.042
... A great family.

40:48.608 --> 40:51.612
Sorry, I could not do
it work.

40:53.505 --> 40:55.564
- Keep it Paddy.
- No. ..

40:58.656 --> 41:00.141
Keep it ...

41:01.702 --> 41:04.430
I remember like it was before ...

41:04.431 --> 41:07.190
life we had.

41:19.284 --> 41:23.829
You're a good father
in here you're a good man.

41:43.573 --> 41:46.021
What the hell are you doing?

41:47.752 --> 41:50.757
- What do you think we doing?
- Making a mistake.

41:51.639 --> 41:55.248
I know that their marriage
is a farce, I heard,

41:55.249 --> 41:58.210
on divorce in Ireland.

41:58.211 --> 42:00.301
Do not try to deny it.

42:00.919 --> 42:05.306
Mom, you told me the basics
a strong relationship is the truth.

42:07.531 --> 42:11.286
Is it because it is love
or because it is easy?

42:20.719 --> 42:22.718
Just do the right thing.

42:22.719 --> 42:25.915
Not by us
or by someone else ...

42:25.916 --> 42:28.035
... For you.

42:37.039 --> 42:39.540
We'll love you no matter
what happens.

42:50.569 --> 42:53.497
You know, you should not
be so lonely.

42:53.498 --> 42:55.957
to be honest ...

42:55.958 --> 42:59.552
would not take it that way
to kill children.

43:02.079 --> 43:05.229
In what regards
this member into law.

43:08.844 --> 43:11.917
I'm just kidding with you!
Go! Go!

43:11.918 --> 43:13.621
Your turn!

43:21.654 --> 43:23.736
You were in
for a while,

43:23.737 --> 43:27.232
and need to leave ...
to despejarte.

43:27.233 --> 43:30.229
Croker Like I love you Libby!

43:49.088 --> 43:52.501
Do not worry about them, are
accustomed to disappear.

43:52.502 --> 43:55.004
