00:00.039 --> 00:01.380
Previously on Switched at Birth... 

00:01.381 --> 00:03.340
There have been rumors that Mr. Reycraft

00:03.374 --> 00:05.108
is having an inappropriate relationship

00:05.143 --> 00:06.810
with one of the employees.

00:06.845 --> 00:07.878
Are you gonna lose your job?

00:07.912 --> 00:08.912
I already quit.

00:08.947 --> 00:09.880
Why would you quit?

00:09.914 --> 00:11.832
I want him more than I want the job!

00:11.883 --> 00:12.916
- I care about you.
- That means...

00:12.951 --> 00:15.018
"I don't love you back."

00:15.053 --> 00:16.887
What are you doing here?

00:16.921 --> 00:18.589
Travis, are you sleeping here?

00:19.891 --> 00:20.858
We have been cutting you slack

00:20.892 --> 00:22.559
ever since we found out about the switch!

00:22.627 --> 00:24.728
- And we're done.
- Yeah, I got it.

00:25.797 --> 00:27.397
I can't believe you came out

00:27.432 --> 00:28.632
all this way just to find me.

00:28.633 --> 00:32.302
... 

00:32.403 --> 00:35.072
Have you reached a verdict
in each of these two cases?

00:35.106 --> 00:36.139
We find in favor of the plaintiffs,

00:36.174 --> 00:38.242
John Kennish and Kathryn Kennish...

00:38.276 --> 00:40.043
in the amount of $1.

00:40.078 --> 00:41.311
In the matter of Angelo Sorrento

00:41.346 --> 00:42.980
versus children's hospital

00:43.014 --> 00:45.949
of Kansas City, we find in
favor of the plaintiff...

00:45.984 --> 00:47.150
in the amount of five million dollars.

00:48.152 --> 00:49.753
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:49.787 --> 00:50.721
Hi.

00:50.755 --> 00:52.155
I'm looking for Angelo Sorrento.

00:54.759 --> 00:55.726
Do you know where he is?

01:01.906 --> 01:03.840
Well well well!

01:03.874 --> 01:05.659
Hmm, good morning.

01:05.693 --> 01:06.743
- Good morning.
- Mm-hmm.

01:06.777 --> 01:07.877
You know, I gotta admit,

01:07.912 --> 01:10.013
I saw that your bed was
made, and I thought maybe...

01:10.047 --> 01:11.815
I never slept in it, and you
were going to catch me trying

01:11.849 --> 01:12.849
to sneak back in?

01:12.883 --> 01:14.851
- Kinda.
- That was the old Bay Kennish.

01:14.885 --> 01:15.919
The new Bay Kennish

01:15.953 --> 01:17.687
woke up at 6:45 A.M.,

01:17.722 --> 01:19.823
made you a pot of freshly-brewed coffee,

01:19.857 --> 01:22.509
ran out and picked up some
salted caramel sticky buns...

01:22.543 --> 01:23.510
 ... From La Crèmerie.

01:23.544 --> 01:26.563
And just finished 48 pages
of "Eyes on the prize."

01:26.597 --> 01:28.565
That's what I'm talking about.

01:28.599 --> 01:31.184
Mm-hmm, I like this new Bay Kennish.

01:31.218 --> 01:32.535
I may not make valedictorian...

01:32.570 --> 01:34.271
- Never say never.
- ... But I'm determined

01:34.305 --> 01:36.389
not to be in the bottom 10 either.

01:42.046 --> 01:43.179
Hey.

01:43.213 --> 01:45.198
You're up already?

01:45.232 --> 01:49.019
Six miles, 100 sit-ups and 10 push-ups.

01:49.086 --> 01:50.820
Are we in training for something?

01:50.855 --> 01:51.788
No.

01:51.822 --> 01:53.189
I'm just trying to get in shape.

01:55.159 --> 01:56.926
Are you waiting to hear back from someone?

02:11.409 --> 02:12.442
Dude!

02:12.476 --> 02:13.560
This is awesome.

02:13.611 --> 02:14.544
Completely restored.

02:14.578 --> 02:15.712
No kidding.

02:15.746 --> 02:18.247
At this rate, he'll blow
through it in six months.

02:18.265 --> 02:20.483
Looks like the check just cleared.

02:20.551 --> 02:22.218
You like it?

02:22.236 --> 02:24.120
It is so pretty!

02:24.155 --> 02:25.422
I love old cars.

02:25.456 --> 02:27.057
But you're not painting this one, no.

02:27.091 --> 02:28.108
Could I please take it for a spin?

02:28.142 --> 02:29.425
- Absolutely.
- Not!

02:29.443 --> 02:31.461
Remember the car we used to have?

02:31.495 --> 02:34.297
1979 silver convertible Bug.

02:34.332 --> 02:36.199
I think we paid 600 for it.

02:36.233 --> 02:37.267
We've come a long way.

02:38.269 --> 02:39.202
- John?
- Yeah?

02:39.236 --> 02:41.004
Catch.

02:41.038 --> 02:42.772
Open the trunk. Check it out.

02:42.807 --> 02:43.807
Oh, no, I don't need to...

02:43.841 --> 02:44.841
No, really. Go ahead.

02:44.875 --> 02:46.092
Okay.

02:47.812 --> 02:48.728
Whoa!

02:48.779 --> 02:49.879
What's all this?!

02:51.048 --> 02:52.015
Adrianna.

02:53.984 --> 02:55.885
- And this is for you.
- What?

02:55.920 --> 02:57.620
This is for you.

02:58.589 --> 03:00.390
Oh, my God! Is this real?

03:00.424 --> 03:01.358
- Totally real.
- It's a letter

03:01.392 --> 03:03.443
from Frida Kahlo to Diego.

03:03.494 --> 03:04.577
What?! Let me see that.

03:04.612 --> 03:05.662
No, you're not serious.

03:05.696 --> 03:06.730
Three hours of studio time.

03:06.764 --> 03:08.598
I hope it's enough.

03:08.632 --> 03:10.433
Dude, this guy recorded the Flaming Lips!

03:10.451 --> 03:11.534
This is amazing!

03:11.602 --> 03:13.236
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

03:13.270 --> 03:14.537
- No, I can't accept...
- Please.

03:14.572 --> 03:17.223
With all the hospitality
in letting me stay here.

03:17.258 --> 03:19.275
Thank you so much. And this is...

03:19.309 --> 03:21.111
- for you.
- A cappuccino maker.

03:21.145 --> 03:23.263
I have been dying to get one of these!

03:23.297 --> 03:25.181
- You mentioned that once.
- Oh! Thank you!

03:25.216 --> 03:28.151
- I'm glad you like it.
- Um, did you get Daphne anything?

03:29.220 --> 03:30.320
- Oh, no.
- No no no no, it's okay.

03:30.354 --> 03:32.055
I don't... I don't need anything.

03:33.791 --> 03:35.759
Actually...

03:35.793 --> 03:38.895
I got a little something for you.

03:38.929 --> 03:39.896
Come on!

03:40.965 --> 03:42.549
That looks like a food truck!

03:42.600 --> 03:43.800
Ta-da!

03:43.834 --> 03:45.835
- It is a food truck!
- You got my daughter

03:45.870 --> 03:47.637
- a food truck?
- She can take it on the weekend.

03:47.671 --> 03:49.506
She can take it after school.

03:49.540 --> 03:51.441
She can cook whatever she wants.

03:51.475 --> 03:52.775
- Vegetarian food...
-Whoa whoa whoa! Hold on one second!

03:52.793 --> 03:54.711
- She's in high school.
- I got this, I got...

03:54.745 --> 03:56.346
She won't have to deal with bosses

03:56.380 --> 03:57.480
or... or kitchen politics.

03:57.515 --> 04:00.250
- Uh, this is pretty rocking.
- Yee-haw!

04:03.354 --> 04:05.021
What do you think?

04:05.055 --> 04:06.356
It's...

04:06.390 --> 04:09.025
How is she supposed to drive this thing?

04:09.059 --> 04:10.960
- She will learn.
- Angelo, I know

04:10.995 --> 04:12.829
- that you meant well...
- Trust me.

04:12.863 --> 04:14.764
This is what she needs.

04:14.799 --> 04:16.766
Hello, sir. May I take your order?

04:16.801 --> 04:18.735
Uh, we gotta take this thing to Buckner.

04:18.769 --> 04:20.786
And I could help! I can help!

04:23.774 --> 04:25.608
I'm just not sure...

04:25.643 --> 04:26.743
Keep it for one week, okay?

04:26.777 --> 04:27.877
Just one week.

04:27.912 --> 04:29.412
Promise me.

04:30.815 --> 04:32.315
Sure.

04:32.349 --> 04:33.516
You're gonna love it!

04:34.751 --> 04:36.519
Look at you.

04:36.554 --> 04:38.538
All you need is a red
suit and a sleigh, huh?

04:38.572 --> 04:39.522
Yup! 

04:39.557 --> 04:41.191
Merry Christmas.

04:45.262 --> 04:46.229
Wow!

04:46.263 --> 04:48.148
Uh, yeah!

04:48.199 --> 04:51.034
What should we ask for next? A pony?

04:51.068 --> 04:53.036
Okay, so is he...

04:53.070 --> 04:54.220
richer than your parents?

04:54.271 --> 04:56.706
Or is it all sort of at the same level?

04:56.740 --> 04:58.875
Yeah, it's definitely not the same.

04:58.909 --> 05:01.844
And there are levels of richness.

05:01.862 --> 05:04.781
And rich people love to compare themselves

05:04.815 --> 05:07.484
to extra-rich people and claim poverty.

05:08.486 --> 05:11.421
He just looks so natural being rich.

05:11.455 --> 05:13.523
Doesn't he? Like it... it just fits him.

05:13.557 --> 05:15.558
Not like me or my mom.

05:15.593 --> 05:18.628
Do you think she's regretting
not taking the money?

05:18.662 --> 05:20.263
No way.

05:20.297 --> 05:22.265
Do you actually see my mom

05:22.299 --> 05:24.267
living off of Angelo's millions?

05:24.301 --> 05:26.102
She would cut off her right arm

05:26.136 --> 05:28.204
before she'd be some kept woman.

05:28.239 --> 05:30.874
First he punches out your boyfriend,

05:30.908 --> 05:33.076
then he just gives you a food truck.

05:33.110 --> 05:34.878
He definitely swings big.

05:34.912 --> 05:36.713
Well, I appreciate all the effort,

05:36.747 --> 05:38.848
but I am not driving around town

05:38.883 --> 05:41.551
selling corn dogs.

05:41.585 --> 05:42.685
You know, I don't think Merkie

05:42.720 --> 05:44.587
and Ivan Ronan have even spoken

05:44.622 --> 05:45.889
10 words to us over the years.

05:45.923 --> 05:47.524
Why would they invite us to golf?

05:47.558 --> 05:48.591
They must want something.

05:48.626 --> 05:49.692
When are we getting rid of that food truck?

05:49.727 --> 05:51.294
Next week?

05:51.328 --> 05:53.328
Oh! She's on the board of
that spinal cord charity.

05:53.330 --> 05:54.497
That must be it.

05:54.532 --> 05:56.366
I can't believe how you fawned
over that coffee machine.

05:56.400 --> 05:57.500
Yeah, well you say that,

05:57.535 --> 06:00.069
but then * try this. *

06:00.104 --> 06:02.071
And then you encourage her
to actually use the truck?

06:02.106 --> 06:03.206
The dumbest gift in the world?

06:03.240 --> 06:05.808
I was just trying to be supportive.

06:05.843 --> 06:07.243
She's been so down lately.

06:07.278 --> 06:08.211
How about that car?

06:08.245 --> 06:10.013
Is that a cliché?

06:10.047 --> 06:12.615
Win a bunch of money, buy a sports car.

06:12.650 --> 06:13.917
Do you want me to put
the clubs in your Porsche?

06:13.951 --> 06:15.952
I earned my money.

06:15.986 --> 06:18.488
He's just never been able
to give her a present.

06:18.522 --> 06:20.423
He was just trying to...

06:20.457 --> 06:22.392
He's showing us up, Kathryn,
that's what he's doing.

06:22.426 --> 06:24.360
He rubbing our face in
the dollar... excuse me.

06:24.395 --> 06:26.663
The 66 cents that we actually won.

06:28.465 --> 06:29.632
Hi.

06:29.667 --> 06:31.234
Hi.

06:31.268 --> 06:32.535
- Hi.
- Bye.

06:32.570 --> 06:34.304
- Bye.
- Have a nice day.

06:34.338 --> 06:35.538
Yeah, have a...

Uh, hey hey. Hey, uh...

07:12.309 --> 07:14.877
Me need...

07:14.912 --> 07:16.012
find, uh, the... the...

07:16.046 --> 07:17.113
what do you call it?

07:17.147 --> 07:18.114
It's the place, uh...

07:18.148 --> 07:19.065
the office... 

07:19.116 --> 07:21.718
The place where you sign up for classes.

07:29.593 --> 07:31.594
Okay, I gotta go over there somewhere.

07:31.629 --> 07:33.363
Eh, it's okay. You can come with me.

07:33.397 --> 07:34.330
Okay.

07:34.365 --> 07:35.298
Great, you talk.

07:35.332 --> 07:36.466
Uh, you're in the pilot program too?

07:36.500 --> 07:38.668
No no no, I'm deaf. But oral.

07:38.702 --> 07:40.203
- Come on.
- Okay.

07:45.342 --> 07:46.342
I'm Teo.

07:46.377 --> 07:47.476
Daphne.

07:49.312 --> 07:50.380
So when do I get the "thank you"?

07:50.414 --> 07:52.015
For what?

07:52.049 --> 07:54.067
Uh, for being switched at birth.

07:54.101 --> 07:58.204
I lead a life of confusion and turmoil,

07:58.238 --> 08:01.124
and you get a private studio session

08:01.158 --> 08:02.125
with The Flaming Lips.

08:02.159 --> 08:03.209
Okay, it's not The Flaming Lips;

08:03.260 --> 08:04.861
it's their producer.

08:04.895 --> 08:06.179
But thank you.

08:06.230 --> 08:09.132
Actually, it's not so bad for me.

08:13.937 --> 08:15.154
So what's your angle these days?

08:15.205 --> 08:17.156
All nose to the grindstone.

08:17.207 --> 08:18.927
I guess it's kinda like
when all else fails,

08:18.942 --> 08:20.043
read the directions.

08:20.077 --> 08:22.962
When all else fails, try to make it work.

08:22.997 --> 08:24.297
Wow, after 11 years,

08:24.331 --> 08:27.000
you finally decided to
stop fighting it here.

08:27.051 --> 08:28.251
Congratulations.

08:28.285 --> 08:29.335
Excuse me? Hello?

08:29.386 --> 08:31.254
You're not allowed to park here.

08:31.288 --> 08:32.337
Mario, what's... what do you mean?

08:32.389 --> 08:34.307
It's us... Toby and Bay.

08:34.341 --> 08:35.991
But I was told the car
can't be here anymore.

08:36.025 --> 08:37.010
As long as it's painted like that.

08:40.297 --> 08:41.931
What's wrong with how it's painted?

08:41.965 --> 08:43.982
Some kind of anti-graffiti mandate.

08:44.018 --> 08:45.968
Doesn't fit the Buckner image.

08:45.986 --> 08:50.940
So 16-year-olds driving
$60,000 cars is fine,

08:50.974 --> 08:53.309
but a couple of sea
creatures are offensive?

08:53.327 --> 08:55.161
Just move it.

08:57.031 --> 08:58.281
Park it around back please.

09:04.621 --> 09:06.111
You're building a house here?

09:06.424 --> 09:08.991
- On a golf course?
- Yeah.

09:09.026 --> 09:10.960
Isn't this John and Kathryn golf course?

09:10.994 --> 09:12.962
Really?

09:12.996 --> 09:14.230
I had no idea.

09:17.167 --> 09:20.136
And we are building here, not just me.

09:20.170 --> 09:21.304
Any style you want...

09:21.338 --> 09:23.072
modern, victorian... 

09:23.107 --> 09:24.871
Angelo, I'm not leaving Daphne, 

09:24.308 --> 09:26.275
and she's not leaving the Kennishes.

09:26.310 --> 09:28.277
And a year and a half from
now when she leaves the house?

09:28.312 --> 09:29.946
Come on, dream a little!

09:29.980 --> 09:32.949
We can have a pool. We
can have a tennis court.

09:32.983 --> 09:34.743
We can make a space for
your mom if you want.

09:36.186 --> 09:38.321
Okay. But, Gina,

09:38.355 --> 09:40.323
- this is your money.
- No, it's not.

09:40.357 --> 09:43.092
We're married! Your name
is on the deed to the land.

09:43.127 --> 09:45.228
That is for immigration reasons only.

09:47.931 --> 09:49.065
This is crazy.

09:49.099 --> 09:51.217
Here you are, stressing, juggling bills.

09:51.251 --> 09:52.251
I'm doing fine!

09:52.302 --> 09:54.937
If the switch hadn't happened,

09:54.972 --> 09:56.939
we would still be together.

09:56.974 --> 10:00.209
All these things... car, house...

10:00.244 --> 10:03.012
they don't make up for the time we lost.

10:03.046 --> 10:05.348
But if we get back together,

10:05.382 --> 10:07.383
and enjoy them together...

10:09.386 --> 10:11.988
then the money is doing something good.

10:14.191 --> 10:15.925
I did always want a greenhouse.

10:17.194 --> 10:20.763
Then I will build the
finest greenhouse in Kansas.

10:29.640 --> 10:31.707
I was just coming into
your homeroom to find you.

10:31.742 --> 10:33.643
Mr. Reynolds wants to see you.

10:33.677 --> 10:34.777
But I moved it already.

10:34.812 --> 10:36.712
He's expecting you.

10:47.407 --> 10:49.242
This is Teo Hanahan.

10:49.293 --> 10:52.028
He's here for the pilot program.

10:52.062 --> 10:53.929
He was wandering around lost.

10:53.947 --> 10:54.964
She'll take care of you.

10:54.998 --> 10:55.998
Thanks.

11:29.233 --> 11:30.199
Hi! Sorry.

11:30.234 --> 11:31.200
I moved it, everything's okay.

11:31.234 --> 11:33.069
Hi, Mr. Feldman.

11:33.103 --> 11:34.871
Bay. Sit down.

11:34.905 --> 11:36.772
We wanna talk to you.

11:42.713 --> 11:43.946
Is everything okay?

11:43.981 --> 11:46.616
You got a 94 on your French exam.

11:46.650 --> 11:48.451
I did?!

11:48.485 --> 11:49.752
That's high for you, isn't it?

11:49.786 --> 11:51.454
Uh, I... I guess.

11:51.488 --> 11:54.223
But I've been studying
really hard, obviously.

11:54.258 --> 11:57.059
The thing is Bonnie Saterfield got a 97.

11:57.094 --> 12:01.163
- Okay.
- Which is actually not that unusual.

12:01.198 --> 12:02.265
Uh-huh.

12:02.299 --> 12:03.332
And Mr. Feldman has made me aware

12:03.367 --> 12:05.301
that she was sitting

12:05.335 --> 12:07.103
right in front of you.

12:09.706 --> 12:11.941
You think I cheated?

12:11.975 --> 12:14.744
We're just trying to
figure out what's what here.

12:14.778 --> 12:16.545
I... I didn't cheat.

12:16.580 --> 12:17.713
My biological father is French,

12:17.748 --> 12:20.449
which Monsieur Feldman knows.

12:20.484 --> 12:21.684
We have a student honor board

12:21.718 --> 12:23.753
as, of course, you know.

12:23.787 --> 12:26.689
You've been encouraging me
to study more all semester,

12:26.723 --> 12:29.458
and when I do, you wanna put
me in front of an honor board?

12:29.493 --> 12:31.227
The honor board is made up of your peers.

12:31.261 --> 12:33.095
You'll be treated fairly.

12:34.214 --> 12:35.197
Thank you.

12:37.100 --> 12:38.234
If I was being treated fairly,

12:38.268 --> 12:40.069
I wouldn't have to go in
front of an honor board.

12:47.706 --> 12:49.691
I was so impressed with your book.

12:49.725 --> 12:51.492
Well, thank you.

12:51.510 --> 12:53.260
And your testimony

12:53.279 --> 12:54.595
in that case against the hospital?

12:54.613 --> 12:56.297
You kept your cool.

12:56.332 --> 12:58.549
But you were so articulate
and powerful in damning them.

12:58.601 --> 13:00.134
Oh, I don't know.

13:00.168 --> 13:02.186
It didn't seem to convince the jury.

13:02.237 --> 13:04.238
Oh, those things can be funny.

13:04.272 --> 13:06.124
Ivan's done enough of those cases to know

13:06.175 --> 13:08.376
you can't always tell which
way the wind's gonna blow.

13:08.410 --> 13:11.145
You've handled this whole thing
with such grace under fire.

13:11.180 --> 13:12.246
We've all been talking about it.

13:12.281 --> 13:14.916
Really?

13:14.950 --> 13:16.050
That's nice.

13:20.189 --> 13:21.122
Nice shot.

13:21.156 --> 13:22.857
I don't know.

13:22.891 --> 13:24.892
It must have been some
kind of chronic depression.

13:24.927 --> 13:26.594
Who are you talking about, honey?

13:26.629 --> 13:27.662
Frank Slade.

13:27.696 --> 13:28.713
Oh, that's so sad.

13:28.764 --> 13:29.831
We didn't even know he was sick.

13:29.865 --> 13:31.566
Neither did we.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.735
You must be scrambling to
find someone to fill his seat.

13:33.769 --> 13:36.270
Funny you should say that.

13:36.305 --> 13:38.339
You're gonna have a
special election, right?

13:38.374 --> 13:39.390
Three months from now.

13:39.425 --> 13:42.377
People seem pretty rocked by his death.

13:42.411 --> 13:44.278
We need somebody...

13:44.313 --> 13:46.881
that everybody's familiar with, you know?

13:46.915 --> 13:48.082
Like a brand.

13:48.117 --> 13:49.150
Instant name recognition,

13:49.184 --> 13:51.019
warmth, likability.

13:52.187 --> 13:53.721
What do you think of Nick Miner?

13:55.691 --> 13:57.892
I mean, I know you played with him
a couple years back, back in the day.

13:58.046 --> 14:00.748
I talk to Nick from time to time.

14:00.783 --> 14:03.551
Shauna's in my book club.

14:03.585 --> 14:05.486
Would you feel comfortable
reaching out to him?

14:05.521 --> 14:07.388
Encouraging him to step up for us?

14:07.422 --> 14:09.624
I talk to him all the
time, but he only knows me

14:09.658 --> 14:11.526
as the local party representative.

14:11.560 --> 14:12.593
Absolutely.

14:12.628 --> 14:14.629
Sure. Yeah. Happy to help.

14:21.150 --> 14:25.740
... 

14:25.741 --> 14:29.001
... 

14:29.002 --> 14:30.121
... 

14:39.160 --> 14:40.922
... 

14:43.152 --> 14:45.157
... 

14:45.158 --> 14:50.998
... 

14:51.913 --> 14:56.216
... 

15:00.200 --> 15:02.518
... 

15:02.519 --> 15:04.878
... 

15:08.068 --> 15:11.375
... 

15:17.170 --> 15:19.950
... 

15:19.951 --> 15:21.757
... 

15:21.758 --> 15:26.129
... 

15:27.855 --> 15:31.590
... 

15:32.241 --> 15:35.014
... 

15:37.301 --> 15:38.476
... 

15:40.942 --> 15:44.377
... 

15:44.378 --> 15:46.925
... 

15:50.893 --> 15:53.628
All right, bye.

15:53.662 --> 15:55.463
Nick Miner...

15:55.497 --> 15:56.830
That guy's as dumb as a box of rocks.

15:56.848 --> 15:58.633
Ah, you know what? I'm sorry.

15:58.667 --> 16:00.601
- That's insulting to rocks.
- Honestly.

16:00.636 --> 16:02.403
I think I'm more qualified

16:02.421 --> 16:03.737
to run for State Senate than he is.

16:03.755 --> 16:05.423
No kidding.

16:05.474 --> 16:06.607
You know, it's funny.

16:06.642 --> 16:08.643
When Merkie was going
on and on about my book

16:08.677 --> 16:09.710
and my testimony,

16:09.745 --> 16:12.513
I kinda thought that maybe she was...

16:15.250 --> 16:17.385
uh, anyway, um...

16:17.419 --> 16:19.604
So what are you gonna do? Are you
gonna be a good Republican soldier?

16:19.655 --> 16:22.156
'Cause Ivan's not a bad
guy to have on our side.

16:22.190 --> 16:23.491
Yeah, I know. I'll convince Nick to run.

16:23.525 --> 16:25.543
But you know what? I ain't votin' for him.

16:29.431 --> 16:31.332
I wasn't even gonna tell you!

16:31.366 --> 16:34.035
I was just gonna deal with this myself
until I read your testimony in the paper

16:34.069 --> 16:36.003
about being cheated
out of raising your kid!

16:36.038 --> 16:36.727
So crazy me,

16:36.728 --> 16:39.177
I thought maybe you wanted to know
that you had another one out there.

16:40.809 --> 16:42.576
Sorry.

16:42.611 --> 16:45.546
Um, I just wanted to come and say thank you

16:45.580 --> 16:47.682
again for the producer.

16:47.716 --> 16:49.617
This is a bad time,

16:49.651 --> 16:50.818
so, uh, I'm gonna go.

16:50.852 --> 16:52.653
No no.

16:52.688 --> 16:54.755
Stay.

16:54.790 --> 16:56.691
We're done here.

16:56.725 --> 16:58.659
I'll go.

17:07.487 --> 17:08.676
We met on a plane back to Italy

17:08.678 --> 17:10.645
and then we bumped into a
each other in a cafe in Rome.

17:10.680 --> 17:12.646
Honestly, I don't even need the details.

17:12.682 --> 17:15.617
Adrianna had just called the
cops on me for God's sake!

17:15.651 --> 17:17.551
I didn't even know if I'd
ever get back to this country.

17:17.586 --> 17:19.320
I'm so above my pay grade here.

17:19.355 --> 17:21.556
I really am the worst possible
person to be talking to.

17:21.589 --> 17:23.558
She shows up at the courthouse

17:23.592 --> 17:25.492
the day I win five million dollars,

17:25.528 --> 17:28.163
claiming to have my baby
after one night together?!

17:28.196 --> 17:30.031
I mean, what would you have thought?

17:30.066 --> 17:33.001
Uh, a situation I haven't even
been close to encountering.

17:33.035 --> 17:34.069
So I ask her to...

17:34.103 --> 17:35.103
to take a D.N.A. test.

17:35.137 --> 17:36.738
Does that make me a bad guy?

17:36.772 --> 17:38.740
I guess not.

17:38.774 --> 17:40.975
One time... one time...

17:41.010 --> 17:42.911
How could this happen?

17:42.945 --> 17:43.945
Now of all times.

17:43.979 --> 17:45.513
What does she want?

17:45.548 --> 17:46.648
I don't know.

17:46.682 --> 17:49.517
I don't think she knows.

17:49.552 --> 17:51.553
But is she gonna, like,
tell people or anything?

17:51.587 --> 17:52.654
I don't know.

17:52.688 --> 17:54.489
I don't know anything
except that I'm screwed.

17:54.490 --> 17:56.358
Just give me some time.

17:56.392 --> 17:59.494
I need to try to deal with this.

17:59.528 --> 18:01.062
Okay?

18:00.997 --> 18:02.197
Can you keep it to yourself?

18:05.835 --> 18:06.868
Son of a bitch.

18:06.902 --> 18:09.738
After all the money we pay them?

18:09.772 --> 18:11.039
And all the money I've raised for them?

18:11.073 --> 18:12.607
You know what? I always hated

18:12.642 --> 18:13.842
that Monsieur Feldman.

18:13.876 --> 18:15.677
It's actually pronounced... Feldman.

18:15.711 --> 18:18.546
Who's on this honor board anyway, huh?

18:18.581 --> 18:20.615
A bunch of brown nosers
passing judgment on their peers.

18:20.650 --> 18:23.401
How are they supposed to
decide if you cheated or not?

18:23.452 --> 18:24.552
Yeah.

18:24.587 --> 18:25.720
I have to present a case,

18:25.755 --> 18:27.522
Monsieur Feldman has to present a case.

18:27.556 --> 18:28.657
And then the board votes.

18:28.691 --> 18:30.525
And then they decide if you're suspended?

18:30.559 --> 18:32.527
Or expelled.

18:32.561 --> 18:33.495
- What?!
- What?!

18:33.529 --> 18:36.231
They can't expel you for a test
you didn't cheat on! That's crazy!

18:36.265 --> 18:40.001
Because crazy and unfair
things never happen to me?

18:40.036 --> 18:41.236
I am calling that Ned Reynolds again.

18:41.270 --> 18:42.203
Mom.

18:42.238 --> 18:44.005
Don't. There's no point.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.974
I have an idea.

18:46.008 --> 18:48.576
I asked Angelo to come to the honor board.

18:48.611 --> 18:49.711
What's Angelo gonna do?

18:49.745 --> 18:50.705
Give everybody presents?

18:50.713 --> 18:52.480
He's gonna speak in French

18:52.515 --> 18:54.582
and prove that he's real,

18:54.617 --> 18:56.551
and that's why I improved so much.

18:56.585 --> 18:59.254
Well, that's a great idea.

18:59.288 --> 19:01.539
I am so proud of you!

19:01.590 --> 19:04.175
- You're gonna do fine.
- Sweetie, I'm not so sure

19:04.226 --> 19:07.362
it's a great idea to have Angelo as
your backup in front of an honor board.

19:07.396 --> 19:09.397
Are you kidding me?

19:09.432 --> 19:11.366
Angelo and a jury? He'll
probably walk out of there

19:11.400 --> 19:13.234
with another million bucks.

19:13.269 --> 19:14.869
Good point.

19:18.908 --> 19:21.710
Hey, can you give me a hand?

19:21.744 --> 19:23.745
Oh, yeah. Sure.

19:25.881 --> 19:27.549
Thank you. Whoo.

19:27.583 --> 19:28.616
It's for Angelo's condo.

19:28.651 --> 19:29.968
I have to keep a bunch of things there

19:30.002 --> 19:31.586
in case immigration stops by.

19:31.620 --> 19:32.821
Uh-huh.

19:32.855 --> 19:35.523
I actually wanted to talk to
you about something else too.

19:35.558 --> 19:37.442
Oh, yeah?

19:37.476 --> 19:39.461
Um...

19:39.495 --> 19:43.331
Angelo's asked me to help
design this house he's building.

19:43.366 --> 19:46.434
He wants a music room, and I was
looking into soundproof walls.

19:46.469 --> 19:48.470
Wait. You're moving in with Angelo?

19:48.504 --> 19:51.373
Uh... not today.

19:51.407 --> 19:53.942
But, um, down the line.

19:53.976 --> 19:56.344
I mean, I don't really see

19:56.379 --> 19:58.113
what would be stopping me.

19:58.147 --> 20:00.014
I'm certainly not gonna camp
out in your parents' backyard

20:00.049 --> 20:01.009
for the rest of my life.

20:01.016 --> 20:02.016
Right.

20:02.051 --> 20:04.085
- I hear that.
- And, um,

20:04.120 --> 20:06.020
I've kinda felt guilty that
they've even had to deal

20:06.055 --> 20:09.758
with Angelo and all the drama.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.760
But, you know, it sorta feels
like all that's finally behind us.

20:11.794 --> 20:13.595
And maybe we can all get
a fresh start, you know?

20:13.629 --> 20:16.331
Yeah, well, I'll send you that info

20:16.365 --> 20:17.399
on the soundproofing walls.

20:17.433 --> 20:19.384
Oh, okay. Thanks!

20:20.386 --> 20:22.537
Okay.

20:56.639 --> 20:57.705
Hey.

20:57.740 --> 20:59.441
Hey.

21:02.344 --> 21:03.278
How are you?

21:03.312 --> 21:05.246
I'm okay.

21:06.515 --> 21:09.150
I saw your review in the "Penny."

21:09.185 --> 21:11.920
"The blue corn muffins are
like little clouds of heaven."

21:11.954 --> 21:12.987
Not bad.

21:15.157 --> 21:16.090
Yeah, thanks.

21:16.125 --> 21:19.093
You still doing the
almond butter with those?

21:21.897 --> 21:23.832
Look, I... I wanted to, uh... 

21:23.866 --> 21:25.667
talk to you about what you asked...

21:25.701 --> 21:27.802
about putting me as a reference.

21:29.839 --> 21:31.606
Is that a problem?

21:31.640 --> 21:33.408
Kind of.

21:34.477 --> 21:38.413
Yeah. Uh, look, I'm...

21:38.447 --> 21:40.982
I'm on probation...

21:41.016 --> 21:42.283
after the whole thing,

21:42.318 --> 21:44.319
and... 

21:44.353 --> 21:46.254
plus, this is... this is a small town,

21:46.288 --> 21:49.891
and a lot of chefs know
what happened between us.

21:49.925 --> 21:53.094
So when they call and ask why you left...

21:54.730 --> 21:57.665
I'm gonna have to be honest.

21:57.700 --> 21:59.667
And I... I don't think
that's helping anyone.

22:01.604 --> 22:03.738
Right.

22:03.772 --> 22:07.308
But it's... it's your call.

22:07.343 --> 22:08.464
I'll do whatever you prefer.

22:08.477 --> 22:10.378
You can put me down,

22:10.412 --> 22:12.347
you don't have to put me down.

22:12.381 --> 22:15.083
It's fine.

22:15.117 --> 22:18.019
But whatever you decide...

22:18.053 --> 22:19.988
you don't have to text me...

22:21.223 --> 22:23.157
every time that you do.

22:26.195 --> 22:28.796
You and me, we...

22:28.831 --> 22:30.732
we can't be friends.

22:37.306 --> 22:38.573
Got it.

22:40.242 --> 22:41.543
I'm sorry.

22:46.115 --> 22:47.382
Again.

23:06.936 --> 23:11.746
... 

23:11.747 --> 23:13.941
... 

23:13.942 --> 23:14.942
... 

23:16.481 --> 23:19.746
... 

23:19.747 --> 23:22.477
... 

23:22.478 --> 23:25.573
... 

23:27.000 --> 23:29.330
... 

23:33.011 --> 23:35.477
... 

23:53.474 --> 23:54.474
Hi.

23:54.492 --> 23:55.742
Hey. It talks.

23:55.776 --> 23:57.544
Can you believe that?

23:57.578 --> 23:59.212
Who needs a talking telescope?

23:59.247 --> 24:00.213
Here's the thing:

24:00.247 --> 24:01.448
the book's done,

24:01.482 --> 24:03.233
I recorded the audio version last week...

24:03.284 --> 24:04.484
Which is very cool, by the way.

24:04.518 --> 24:06.119
Thanks.

24:06.153 --> 24:07.187
I've been trying to figure out

24:07.221 --> 24:08.288
what's next for me.

24:09.357 --> 24:11.258
I've been fundraising for years...

24:11.292 --> 24:13.059
pretty successfully, I think.

24:13.094 --> 24:14.227
Very successfully.

24:14.262 --> 24:16.329
And I have a name in
this town, thanks to you

24:16.364 --> 24:17.297
and my book.

24:17.331 --> 24:19.132
I know a ton of people.

24:19.166 --> 24:21.935
And I actually think I'm...

24:21.969 --> 24:23.003
sort of... 

24:23.037 --> 24:24.804
a brand.

24:27.842 --> 24:30.677
You wanna run for Frank Slade's seat?

24:30.711 --> 24:31.811
Think about it.

24:31.846 --> 24:33.813
If I had been in office when they cut

24:33.848 --> 24:35.482
the basketball program at Carlton,

24:35.516 --> 24:36.650
maybe I could have done something.

24:36.684 --> 24:38.618
And there are environmental issues

24:38.653 --> 24:40.320
I'm passionate about.

24:40.354 --> 24:42.589
And all those things I raise money for,

24:42.607 --> 24:45.258
I might actually be able
to follow through on.

24:45.293 --> 24:47.294
Wow, this is not what I expected.

24:47.328 --> 24:48.995
Well, vets run all the time

24:49.030 --> 24:50.430
with no experience other than that.

24:50.431 --> 24:54.301
And did you know that
46 women have succeeded

24:54.335 --> 24:56.936
their late husbands in congress?

24:56.971 --> 24:58.872
Plus, three more that succeeded them,

24:58.906 --> 24:59.906
but didn't follow directly...

24:59.940 --> 25:01.708
I see we've done some research.

25:01.742 --> 25:03.743
I think this is it, John.

25:03.778 --> 25:06.746
I think this is my next step.

25:07.848 --> 25:09.716
Run for office?

25:09.750 --> 25:11.584
I know this family has been through a lot,

25:11.619 --> 25:13.687
but I sort of think
that that's a good thing.

25:13.721 --> 25:16.673
I mean, we've been vetted
backwards and forwards by lawyers,

25:16.724 --> 25:19.559
we're used to being in the public eye

25:19.593 --> 25:22.529
and we don't have to bet the
whole farm on my campaign.

25:22.563 --> 25:23.530
Hold on, hold on.

25:23.564 --> 25:25.298
If you do this, we do this.

25:25.333 --> 25:27.367
We will support you in every way,

25:27.401 --> 25:30.103
whatever that means.

25:30.137 --> 25:32.138
So you see it? You kinda see it now?

25:32.173 --> 25:34.274
Well, I'm starting to.

25:36.110 --> 25:37.277
Okay, so,

25:37.311 --> 25:38.945
I'll go back to Ivan

25:38.979 --> 25:41.014
and I'll tell him that I'm
not supporting Nick Miner,

25:41.048 --> 25:42.849
and I'm throwing your
hat in the ring instead.

25:42.883 --> 25:44.784
Actually, don't do that.

25:44.819 --> 25:45.885
I'll talk to him.

25:57.932 --> 25:58.865
Hey.

25:58.899 --> 26:00.667
Hey!

26:00.701 --> 26:01.701
Glad you're here actually.

26:01.736 --> 26:04.471
Tell me, is this relatively even?

26:05.673 --> 26:06.706
Yeah, looks good.

26:08.609 --> 26:11.089
Shouldn't you be preparing for
your honor board thing tomorrow?

26:12.246 --> 26:13.607
What's to prepare? I didn't cheat.

26:13.614 --> 26:15.515
I'm gonna tell them that.

26:15.549 --> 26:18.385
Do you know how hard this
must have been to find?

26:18.419 --> 26:20.987
An actual handwritten letter of hers?

26:21.021 --> 26:23.256
I've looked online. They
don't even sell these anymore.

26:23.290 --> 26:25.859
Most of them are in museums.

26:25.893 --> 26:27.293
Are you sure it's real?

26:27.328 --> 26:29.996
Of course it's real. He said it was real.

26:30.965 --> 26:33.066
Are you sure everything he says is true?

26:33.100 --> 26:34.968
You taking lessons now from dad?

26:35.002 --> 26:36.002
How to dump on Angelo.

26:39.039 --> 26:40.640
I found out something.

26:40.674 --> 26:42.525
Whatever, Toby.

26:42.560 --> 26:43.643
I probably shouldn't say anything, but...

26:43.677 --> 26:45.678
I feel like I need to tell you.

26:47.782 --> 26:49.449
Okay, he's my family.

26:49.483 --> 26:51.184
And you don't have to like him,

26:51.218 --> 26:53.219
but I won't have you talking
crap about him either.

26:54.488 --> 26:57.123
Bay, he got some chick pregnant.

27:00.094 --> 27:02.996
African-American and gorgeous?

27:03.030 --> 27:04.898
You know?

27:05.966 --> 27:06.966
Yeah.

27:07.001 --> 27:09.769
She was at the trial.

27:09.804 --> 27:12.739
He said she was a reporter
from "People" magazine

27:12.773 --> 27:14.707
and that she was looking for a statement.

27:14.742 --> 27:16.109
It made sense at the time.
A lot of people were calling

27:16.143 --> 27:17.977
and asking for statements.

27:19.847 --> 27:21.881
Do you think Regina and Daphne know?

27:21.916 --> 27:24.484
I think you and I are
the only people who know.

27:26.654 --> 27:27.587
It sucks.

27:27.621 --> 27:29.255
I'm sorry.

27:37.251 --> 27:38.491
This is a great school.

27:40.888 --> 27:41.855
Buckner.

27:41.889 --> 27:43.323
You are so lucky to go here.

27:45.259 --> 27:46.926
Sure am.

27:49.764 --> 27:51.765
You know what that means, right?

27:53.033 --> 27:54.868
"In unity, happiness."

27:54.902 --> 27:57.604
Very true. I agree.

28:00.741 --> 28:03.510
So that "People" magazine article,

28:03.544 --> 28:05.445
I never saw that.

28:05.479 --> 28:07.380
Did it ever come out?

28:11.152 --> 28:12.385
You can come in now.

28:12.403 --> 28:15.188
Uh, I don't know. I will find out.

28:15.222 --> 28:16.322
Come on.

28:20.177 --> 28:22.061
We... we go for walks.

28:22.079 --> 28:23.863
We, uh, watch movies.

28:23.897 --> 28:25.799
All in pure français.

28:25.833 --> 28:28.201
You see, Bay doesn't only learn from books.

28:28.235 --> 28:30.903
She needs to do, not just study.

28:30.921 --> 28:34.057
We're the same like that.

28:34.108 --> 28:37.627
Actually, we're the same in a lot of ways.

28:40.915 --> 28:42.582
You have one more minute.

28:42.616 --> 28:44.684
Is there anything else you'd like to add?

28:44.718 --> 28:46.820
Yes, on a personal note,

28:46.854 --> 28:48.655
I know my daughter.

28:48.689 --> 28:51.591
She's not a liar or a cheater.

28:51.625 --> 28:54.427
If she says something is true...

28:54.462 --> 28:56.429
it's true.

28:57.465 --> 28:58.431
Thank you.

29:01.402 --> 29:02.552
I think it went well.

29:02.603 --> 29:04.137
Mm-hmm.

29:04.171 --> 29:05.171
You're welcome.

29:05.189 --> 29:06.372
Thank you.

29:06.407 --> 29:08.408
Bay, what's going on?

29:12.213 --> 29:14.481
You told me she was a reporter.

29:14.515 --> 29:17.083
You looked me in the eye and you... 

29:17.117 --> 29:18.418
lied to me.

29:18.452 --> 29:21.120
Is that who you are? A liar and
a cheater? How could you do that...

29:21.155 --> 29:23.990
Hold on a second! Regina and
I were not married back then.

29:24.024 --> 29:26.059
But you were with her.

29:26.093 --> 29:27.727
And how could you be so careless?

29:27.761 --> 29:29.028
They hammer into our
heads to use protection,

29:29.063 --> 29:31.798
and my own father doesn't...
on a one night stand?!

29:31.832 --> 29:33.616
I am not talking about this with you, okay?

29:33.667 --> 29:34.734
You really don't have a choice.

29:34.752 --> 29:36.603
Because she exists now,

29:36.637 --> 29:37.737
and we all have to deal with it.

29:37.771 --> 29:39.839
No. This is my problem.

29:39.874 --> 29:41.474
And I'm taking care of it.

29:41.509 --> 29:42.709
What does that mean?

29:42.743 --> 29:44.711
I will give her whatever she wants

29:44.745 --> 29:46.479
to help raise...

29:46.514 --> 29:47.514
The baby.

29:49.149 --> 29:51.417
I don't think she wants
anything to do with me.

29:51.452 --> 29:55.288
So don't worry. Nothing
will change with us.

29:55.322 --> 29:57.323
Nothing will change?

29:57.358 --> 30:00.293
No. That's right.

30:00.361 --> 30:03.796
This is such déjà vu, you have no idea.

30:03.831 --> 30:05.911
Bay, don't walk away from
me when I'm talking to you.

30:05.916 --> 30:07.733
You're just gonna walk out on another kid.

30:07.751 --> 30:09.903
This is not the same!

30:09.937 --> 30:12.071
It is to the kid!

30:12.106 --> 30:13.940
You're gonna leave her or him

30:13.974 --> 30:15.742
to... to never know her father

30:15.776 --> 30:16.976
or the truth about who she is.

30:19.713 --> 30:21.747
Don't you see that?

30:23.651 --> 30:25.251
You're repeating history.

30:25.286 --> 30:27.253
It is the same thing all over again.

30:37.700 --> 30:42.246
... 

30:42.247 --> 30:47.378
... 

30:49.854 --> 30:54.169
... 

30:57.859 --> 31:00.141
... 

31:00.142 --> 31:04.878
... 

31:04.879 --> 31:09.967
... 

31:21.320 --> 31:22.320
Hey.

31:22.354 --> 31:24.389
- Hi.
- How'd it go?

31:24.423 --> 31:26.057
Depends.

31:26.091 --> 31:28.226
Well, did he agree with
you that Kennish is a brand?

31:28.260 --> 31:29.260
Oh, yeah. He agreed.

31:29.295 --> 31:30.895
Fantastic.

31:30.930 --> 31:32.163
He just thinks

31:32.197 --> 31:34.933
a different Kennish should run.

31:34.967 --> 31:36.834
Oh, no...

31:36.869 --> 31:38.536
Oh, yeah.

31:38.571 --> 31:40.838
He pointed out that you have
five successful businesses

31:40.856 --> 31:43.508
that show that you know
how to manage money.

31:43.542 --> 31:45.743
Plus, name recognition, of course.

31:45.778 --> 31:48.646
And voting for you reminds people of

31:48.681 --> 31:50.715
rooting for you and the Royals.

31:50.749 --> 31:52.250
Yeah, you know what? I'm
gonna give him a call.

31:52.284 --> 31:53.401
No no, please.

31:53.435 --> 31:55.253
Don't. You're not gonna say anything to him

31:55.287 --> 31:56.387
that I didn't already say.

31:56.422 --> 31:57.522
He wasn't convinced.

31:59.224 --> 32:00.491
It'd just make me feel bad

32:00.526 --> 32:02.460
being rejected twice in one day. 

32:05.164 --> 32:07.298
Okay.

32:07.333 --> 32:10.018
Okay. Onward, right?

32:10.052 --> 32:11.069
I'll find something else

32:11.103 --> 32:14.138
important and interesting to do,

32:14.173 --> 32:16.774
and all will be well...

32:16.809 --> 32:18.910
and good. 

32:18.944 --> 32:19.911
See you at home.

32:22.548 --> 32:23.848
A phony and a liar!

32:23.882 --> 32:25.667
Just handing out all these gifts,

32:25.701 --> 32:27.752
acting like it is no big deal!

32:28.963 --> 32:33.102
... 

32:33.525 --> 32:34.559
I wish that he hadn't.

32:34.593 --> 32:36.461
Actually, I wish that I hadn't even

32:36.495 --> 32:37.662
done the honor board. You know what?

32:37.680 --> 32:39.330
I should have said, "if that's what you

32:39.348 --> 32:40.748
think of me, then I'll just leave."

32:43.438 --> 32:47.404
... 

32:47.473 --> 32:49.140
I don't even care! 

32:49.174 --> 32:51.109
I hate that place so much.

32:51.143 --> 32:53.094
I hate the stupid uniforms

32:53.145 --> 32:55.380
and I hate the stupid school mottos.

32:55.414 --> 32:58.950
And I hate these stupid assemblies

32:58.984 --> 33:00.885
where we all get together

33:00.919 --> 33:03.187
and we act like these mini versions

33:03.222 --> 33:05.990
of our rich parents. And I was not even

33:06.025 --> 33:07.225
supposed to go there!

33:07.259 --> 33:09.844
You know that, right? If
I hadn't been switched,

33:09.878 --> 33:12.196
then I never would've even gone to Buckner!

33:17.766 --> 33:19.193
... 

33:20.272 --> 33:23.454
... 

33:23.455 --> 33:24.648
... 

33:24.649 --> 33:27.986
... 

33:30.666 --> 33:31.716
Okay.

33:42.594 --> 33:45.163
I wish that you went to Buckner,

33:45.197 --> 33:47.999
then at least I'd have you.

33:50.428 --> 33:52.023
... 

33:52.024 --> 33:56.844
... 

33:56.942 --> 33:59.177
Yeah. I know.

34:34.668 --> 34:36.156
... 

34:36.157 --> 34:38.473
... 

34:39.018 --> 34:40.752
... 

34:40.753 --> 34:43.579
... 

34:45.090 --> 34:46.485
... 

34:46.487 --> 34:49.541
... 

34:50.800 --> 34:52.360
... 

34:53.070 --> 34:56.295
... 

34:57.485 --> 34:59.404
... 

35:00.294 --> 35:02.324
... 

35:03.527 --> 35:04.835
... 

35:07.629 --> 35:11.281
... 

35:12.535 --> 35:14.586
... 

35:14.587 --> 35:17.690
... 

35:18.956 --> 35:22.653
... 

35:24.732 --> 35:27.400
... 

35:27.401 --> 35:30.927
... 

35:30.928 --> 35:32.074
... 

35:32.075 --> 35:35.821
... 

35:35.822 --> 35:37.060
... 

35:37.061 --> 35:42.496
... 

35:44.060 --> 35:47.556
... 

35:49.028 --> 35:52.618
... 

35:52.619 --> 35:56.732
... 

35:57.860 --> 36:00.176
... 

36:01.547 --> 36:02.914
... 

36:02.915 --> 36:05.407
... 

36:05.408 --> 36:07.470
... 

36:07.471 --> 36:11.627
... 

36:14.836 --> 36:16.600
... 

36:16.601 --> 36:19.378
... 

36:26.402 --> 36:29.251
... 

36:29.252 --> 36:33.347
... 

36:35.115 --> 36:38.133
... 

36:38.134 --> 36:40.273
... 

36:41.153 --> 36:42.509
... 

36:57.223 --> 36:58.256
I don't wanna run for office

36:58.290 --> 37:00.391
and I have a full-time job.

37:00.426 --> 37:04.295
When was the last time you were
excited about going to work?

37:04.330 --> 37:06.364
I remember what you were like
when you were playing baseball

37:06.398 --> 37:08.233
and when you started the business...

37:08.267 --> 37:10.802
you were exhilarated every day!

37:10.836 --> 37:12.670
The businesses are my responsibility,

37:12.705 --> 37:13.872
whether they light my fire or not.

37:13.906 --> 37:14.973
Honey,

37:15.007 --> 37:17.742
those car washes
practically run themselves.

37:17.776 --> 37:18.776
Now that's not necessarily true...

37:18.811 --> 37:19.878
And if they don't,

37:19.912 --> 37:21.813
you can find people who will step up.

37:24.850 --> 37:27.752
You know, watching you with
the book this summer, I admit

37:27.786 --> 37:29.721
I realized I didn't have the same passion

37:29.755 --> 37:31.356
for what I do,

37:31.390 --> 37:32.590
but running for office is not...

37:32.625 --> 37:34.492
You're always yelling at the newspaper.

37:34.527 --> 37:37.095
You could finally do something about it

37:37.129 --> 37:40.098
and stop yelling. And I'll help you.

37:40.132 --> 37:41.332
I'll get experience,

37:41.367 --> 37:44.969
find out if this is what I really wanna do.

37:45.004 --> 37:46.271
And maybe next time, I'll run.

37:46.305 --> 37:48.806
We could do a Bill and Hillary kinda thing.

37:48.841 --> 37:50.775
Bite your tongue.

37:52.077 --> 37:54.846
I'm serious.

37:54.880 --> 37:57.815
I can see that.

37:57.850 --> 37:59.751
John, you're a leader.

37:59.785 --> 38:02.453
You deserve a third act.

38:02.488 --> 38:03.588
We both do.

38:08.727 --> 38:10.261
Think about it.

38:41.021 --> 38:42.522
... 

38:45.084 --> 38:47.960
... 

38:50.870 --> 38:53.524
... 

38:53.525 --> 38:55.710

38:55.711 --> 38:59.204

38:59.205 --> 39:02.138

39:06.791 --> 39:08.155

39:09.038 --> 39:11.489

...

40:53.459 --> 40:56.489
... 

41:00.966 --> 41:02.900
- Hey.
- Hi!

41:02.935 --> 41:03.935
Ho-ho!

41:03.969 --> 41:05.153
What is going on?

41:05.187 --> 41:06.904
We're celebrating.

41:06.939 --> 41:08.990
I've decided to keep the truck!

41:09.041 --> 41:11.075
Wait, you're... you're keeping it?

41:11.076 --> 41:16.498
... 

41:17.066 --> 41:18.949
Yeah! 

41:18.967 --> 41:22.854
You guys are on some
sort of crazy sugar high.

41:22.888 --> 41:24.522
Isn't it funny that

41:24.556 --> 41:26.858
everyone thought Angelo
was nuts for giving me this?

41:26.892 --> 41:29.494
Yeah, 'cause is nuts.

41:29.528 --> 41:31.712
Yeah, well, here's to
being switched at birth,

41:31.764 --> 41:33.631
and getting a food truck

41:33.665 --> 41:34.865
to compensate for the damages.

41:37.736 --> 41:39.570
- Yeah.
- Wow!

41:39.605 --> 41:43.407
You are in a really good mood.

41:43.442 --> 41:44.509
Which is good for me,

41:44.543 --> 41:47.545
because I actually wanna talk to you...

41:47.579 --> 41:49.647
about something.

41:49.681 --> 41:50.681
What's going on?

41:50.682 --> 41:51.682
... 

41:51.917 --> 41:53.518
No no no, don't.

41:53.552 --> 41:54.619
What is it?

41:54.653 --> 41:57.789
Uh...

41:57.823 --> 42:00.725
how weird would it be for you

42:00.759 --> 42:05.429
if I went to... Carlton?

42:06.598 --> 42:07.598
Are you serious?

42:11.280 --> 42:13.964
... 

42:14.473 --> 42:15.573
No, you dodo.

42:15.607 --> 42:18.676
There's this pilot
program for hearing kids.

42:18.710 --> 42:20.411
Emmett told me about it.

42:20.445 --> 42:21.579
Oh, my God. She's serious.

42:21.613 --> 42:23.648
Well, I figure that me going to Carlton

42:23.682 --> 42:26.784
makes more sense than me going to Buckner.

42:26.785 --> 42:28.886
... 

42:28.887 --> 42:30.621
No. No! I do not.

42:30.656 --> 42:31.789
Actually, I think

42:31.824 --> 42:33.691
that this could be a great idea.

Can't wait for more "Switched at Birth"?

42:45.751 --> 42:47.485
My hearing daughter at a deaf school?

42:47.503 --> 42:50.422
You're just minutes away
from an exclusive first look

42:50.456 --> 42:52.540
at next weeks all-new "Switched at Birth."

42:52.591 --> 42:55.293
You and me, we have everything.

42:55.328 --> 42:57.529
And yet you still threw it all away.

42:57.563 --> 43:00.498
And now the winter premiere of "Bunheads,"

43:00.533 --> 43:02.500
only on ABC Family.
