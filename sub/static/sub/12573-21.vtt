WEBVTT

00:01.309 --> 00:03.144
I thought you liked my stew.

00:03.311 --> 00:06.580
I don't like beets.

00:08.984 --> 00:11.452
That's why I put all
yours in your father's bowl.

00:13.321 --> 00:14.655
Now go wash your hands.

00:18.693 --> 00:20.795
Jennsen, you have to run.

00:20.862 --> 00:22.229
The D'Harans are here.

00:22.297 --> 00:24.231
They're raiding peoples' homes
looking for you

00:24.299 --> 00:25.332
and the Boxes of Orden.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.101
How did--?
- Hurry, they're on their way.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:41.383 --> 00:42.683
Take this.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.585
It's an Alkalis Stone.

00:46.021 --> 00:48.290
Crack it between your teeth
to release the poison.

00:48.491 --> 00:50.091
It'll be over in ten heartbeats.

00:50.558 --> 00:52.007
You want me
to kill myself?

00:52.794 --> 00:55.229
It's a better fate than what
the D'Harans will do to you

00:55.297 --> 00:57.298
if they catch you.

00:57.365 --> 00:59.066
Now run. Quick.
Out the back.

00:59.134 --> 01:00.501
Now, go.

01:02.470 --> 01:04.538
Open the door!

01:10.045 --> 01:13.047
Is she going to be all right?

01:20.488 --> 01:21.689
Where is she?

01:23.158 --> 01:25.492
Please...

01:25.560 --> 01:26.760
...leave my family alone.

01:26.828 --> 01:29.763
We haven't done anything.

01:31.600 --> 01:33.400
Find her.

01:53.788 --> 01:55.022
Mm.

01:55.090 --> 01:56.724
Commander!

01:56.791 --> 01:58.559
Tracks, sir.

01:58.627 --> 02:01.128
She couldn't
have gotten far.

02:07.636 --> 02:09.402
This way!

02:36.731 --> 02:38.299
Where are the boxes?

02:38.366 --> 02:40.501
I don't have any boxes.

02:48.576 --> 02:51.712
"Like wind over
a field of grass,

02:51.780 --> 02:54.415
"all blades bend to Orden.

02:54.482 --> 02:58.986
"For the one who wields
the magic bends the will of all

02:59.054 --> 03:01.055
to the will of one."

03:04.059 --> 03:06.627
Didn't mean to frighten you,
my boy.

03:09.664 --> 03:11.165
You've been at it all night.

03:11.232 --> 03:12.700
Perhaps you should get
some sleep.

03:12.767 --> 03:15.669
According to this,
the only way to defeat Rahl

03:15.737 --> 03:17.571
is to put all three
Boxes of Orden together

03:17.639 --> 03:20.074
at the next full moon.

03:20.141 --> 03:22.242
But the last time
I put the boxes together,

03:22.310 --> 03:24.178
the power turned me
into a monster.

03:24.245 --> 03:26.680
If Jennsen hadn't separated
the boxes,

03:26.748 --> 03:29.216
I'd probably have razed
every village in D'Hara by now.

03:31.119 --> 03:33.787
The power of Orden
possessed you.

03:33.855 --> 03:36.457
Now you must learn to possess
the power of Orden.

03:36.524 --> 03:37.891
How?

03:37.959 --> 03:40.694
Keep reading.

03:43.331 --> 03:46.066
"Orden is a voracious wolf,

03:46.134 --> 03:49.603
"its strength rivaled only
by its insatiable appetite.

03:49.671 --> 03:53.474
Only one power can touch
the beast's heart and tame it."

03:55.210 --> 03:58.278
What kind of magic could tame
the power of Orden?

03:58.346 --> 04:01.715
Somehow make it safe to use?

04:01.783 --> 04:03.350
I've never heard of a magic

04:03.418 --> 04:05.519
stronger than
the power of Orden.

04:05.587 --> 04:07.855
You once said,
of all the magic in the world,

04:07.922 --> 04:09.456
there is none
more powerful than love.

04:09.524 --> 04:12.192
That's an old expression.

04:12.260 --> 04:14.595
As old as
<i>The Book of Counted Shadows?</i>

04:16.331 --> 04:17.664
What are you thinking?

04:17.732 --> 04:20.100
That the one force that can
touch the beast's heart

04:20.168 --> 04:23.303
and tame it, is love.

04:24.639 --> 04:26.373
The touch of love.

04:33.481 --> 04:35.182
Confession.

04:36.651 --> 04:39.353
I have to be Confessed.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.656
Of course.

04:42.724 --> 04:46.326
A Confessor's touch could temper
the power of Orden

04:46.394 --> 04:48.328
so you wouldn't
turn into a tyrant.

04:48.396 --> 04:51.331
And likewise, Orden would temper
the power of love,

04:51.399 --> 04:53.834
so you wouldn't become
a mindless slave.

04:55.470 --> 04:59.840
You would be left with the
ability to command Darken Rahl.

05:01.476 --> 05:02.876
We'd better tell Kahlan.

05:02.944 --> 05:05.245
No, Zedd, wait, wait.

05:05.313 --> 05:07.915
For as long as I've known her,

05:07.982 --> 05:10.584
the one thing she's been
most afraid of is hurting me.

05:10.652 --> 05:12.820
We only have one
of the boxes.

05:12.887 --> 05:15.589
Until we get the other two
from Jennsen,

05:15.657 --> 05:17.091
there's no point
in telling Kahlan.

05:20.095 --> 05:23.030
Let her sleep.

05:31.306 --> 05:33.340
Here we are.

05:35.410 --> 05:37.010
For my sister.

05:57.098 --> 05:59.133
Hello?

06:02.103 --> 06:03.904
Hm.

06:03.972 --> 06:05.973
Hello?

06:07.976 --> 06:09.009
Jennsen?

06:11.980 --> 06:13.480
Sean!
It's me, Richard.

06:14.983 --> 06:16.850
What? What are you doing?
No, Kahlan, don't!

06:19.120 --> 06:21.155
He's a friend.

06:21.222 --> 06:22.289
At least he used to be.

06:22.357 --> 06:23.690
I'm sorry.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.559
I never thought I could hurt
the Seeker.

06:25.627 --> 06:27.461
Sean,
tell us what's going on.

06:27.529 --> 06:30.864
Darken Rahl found out we were
hiding Jennsen.

06:30.932 --> 06:35.269
To punish us, he unleashed
a magical plague on our village.

06:36.971 --> 06:39.206
Marilee died yesterday.

06:39.274 --> 06:41.942
And now my little girl
is sick.

06:43.711 --> 06:45.812
Rahl will only give us the cure

06:45.880 --> 06:47.614
in exchange
for the Seeker's head.

06:51.452 --> 06:54.688
Where's Jennsen?
- The D'Harans came.

06:54.756 --> 06:57.057
She escaped into the woods
with the boxes

06:57.125 --> 06:58.792
just before
they kicked in my door.

06:58.860 --> 07:00.460
We have to find her.

07:00.528 --> 07:03.163
There's something else
you should know.

07:03.231 --> 07:05.132
I gave her an Alkalis Stone.

07:05.200 --> 07:07.201
In case
she was captured.

07:07.268 --> 07:08.869
I don't know if
she's dead or alive,

07:08.937 --> 07:12.272
but we're in terrible trouble.

07:12.340 --> 07:15.509
People are suffering
like I have never seen.

07:20.682 --> 07:22.816
The healthy banished
all of the sick here.

07:24.219 --> 07:25.519
They're afraid.

07:25.587 --> 07:28.855
Every day, more are herded
into the encampment.

07:32.627 --> 07:34.494
What is this scourge?

07:34.562 --> 07:35.896
We don't know.

07:35.964 --> 07:37.898
People have started calling it
the Fire Fever,

07:37.966 --> 07:40.267
because it spreads
like wildfire.

07:40.335 --> 07:42.069
Careful
not to touch anyone.

07:42.136 --> 07:44.438
If you do, the fire will leap
from their blood into yours.

07:49.777 --> 07:52.412
The hot blood creates
these welts.

07:52.480 --> 07:55.415
Once the welts appear, the
person doesn't have much time.

07:57.252 --> 08:01.955
You have no idea what it is like
to see your child suffer

08:02.023 --> 08:06.360
and not be able to comfort her
even with a simple touch.

08:07.895 --> 08:09.229
Is there anything you can do
for her?

08:13.134 --> 08:14.635
Yes, there is.

08:14.702 --> 08:16.303
And a few others,

08:16.371 --> 08:19.573
but it will require me to draw
the illness out of their bodies

08:19.641 --> 08:21.141
and take it into my own.

08:21.209 --> 08:24.678
I'll need time to rest and purge
the illness from my own blood

08:24.746 --> 08:26.313
every time I heal someone.

08:26.381 --> 08:28.515
If I take on too much,

08:28.583 --> 08:30.851
or don't have enough time
to heal myself,

08:30.918 --> 08:34.321
I'll fall to the plague
the same as everyone else.

08:34.389 --> 08:37.791
But I'll do what I can.

08:37.859 --> 08:40.193
We have to find Jennsen
and get the boxes.

08:40.260 --> 08:42.095
If I can put them
all together,

08:42.163 --> 08:43.864
I can force Rahl
to give us the cure.

08:43.931 --> 08:46.733
Richard, we don't even know
if Jennsen's still alive.

08:48.436 --> 08:50.270
<i>It's a wonder she's not dead.</i>

08:52.373 --> 08:54.341
The worst is over.

08:56.577 --> 08:59.846
Alert me
the moment she wakes.

09:01.582 --> 09:04.017
This girl stole the boxes
from my palace

09:04.085 --> 09:06.019
and is the only one
who knows where they are.

09:06.087 --> 09:11.425
So unless she tells me
where she's hidden them,

09:11.492 --> 09:14.094
the worst is not yet over

09:14.162 --> 09:16.029
for her.

09:20.137 --> 09:21.504
My Lord, she's awake.

09:21.572 --> 09:24.674
But there's a problem.

09:24.742 --> 09:26.976
She doesn't seem to remember
anything.

09:27.044 --> 09:28.711
How convenient.

09:28.779 --> 09:31.081
My Lord, if I may.

09:31.148 --> 09:32.749
I believe she's telling
the truth.

09:32.817 --> 09:35.351
Your men were overzealous
with her.

09:35.419 --> 09:37.787
They beat her viciously.

09:37.855 --> 09:39.956
I've seen people who have
suffered blows like this

09:40.024 --> 09:42.592
to the head, and often
their senses are dulled.

09:42.660 --> 09:46.896
It's not surprising
she's lost her memories.

09:50.401 --> 09:51.701
Who are you?

09:51.769 --> 09:53.636
You don't remember me?

09:53.704 --> 09:55.105
No.

09:55.172 --> 09:59.175
I don't even know where I am
or how I got here.

10:01.846 --> 10:04.047
It's all right.

10:04.115 --> 10:07.083
You're safe now.

10:07.151 --> 10:09.185
I'm a friend.

10:09.253 --> 10:11.121
And this is my home.

10:11.188 --> 10:13.123
Should I know you? I'm sorry.

10:14.959 --> 10:19.496
No, please don't apologize.

10:19.563 --> 10:21.898
It's not your fault.

10:21.966 --> 10:25.101
And I promise I will
tell you everything.

10:25.169 --> 10:28.705
But perhaps it's a blessing
that you don't remember

10:28.772 --> 10:30.907
the terrible things
your brother did to you.

10:30.975 --> 10:32.809
My brother?

10:32.877 --> 10:37.413
People call him the Seeker.

10:39.416 --> 10:41.284
If you had managed
to chop my head off,

10:41.352 --> 10:42.752
where would you have taken it?

10:42.820 --> 10:45.388
There's a D'Haran garrison
only a day's journey away.

10:45.456 --> 10:48.124
If I Confess whoever's
in charge of this garrison,

10:48.192 --> 10:50.760
we might find out what happened
to Jennsen and the boxes.

10:50.828 --> 10:52.195
We might even be able
to get the cure.

10:52.263 --> 10:53.596
What do you mean?

10:53.664 --> 10:57.167
If Rahl created this plague,
then maybe he has a way

10:57.234 --> 10:58.735
to protect his own men
from it.

10:58.802 --> 11:01.871
I'll stay here
and do what I can to help

11:01.939 --> 11:05.041
while you two
go to the garrison.

11:06.777 --> 11:08.811
How are we gonna get
close enough to Confess him?

11:08.879 --> 11:11.381
They want the Seeker's head?

11:13.150 --> 11:14.350
Let's give it to them.

11:21.425 --> 11:23.693
I have the head of the Seeker!

11:25.496 --> 11:27.330
I will give it only
to the commander.

11:27.398 --> 11:31.201
Tell him to bring the cure for
the fever to Sorcerer's Bluff,

11:31.268 --> 11:33.303
alone,

11:33.370 --> 11:36.839
and I will exchange
the head for the cure.

11:57.895 --> 11:59.062
My son is next.

11:59.129 --> 12:02.065
And then their loved ones.

12:02.132 --> 12:04.367
I'm sorry,
but I need to rest now.

12:04.435 --> 12:06.402
I can only cure a few
at a time

12:06.470 --> 12:09.072
or the sickness
will overtake me, and--

12:09.139 --> 12:10.873
And I won't be able
to cure anyone.

12:10.941 --> 12:13.276
Once you've rested,
you'll heal my son.

12:13.344 --> 12:15.878
The village baker is next.

12:15.946 --> 12:18.414
You'll heal the baker
over my dying child?

12:18.482 --> 12:21.517
The baker will bake the bread
necessary to feed everyone

12:21.585 --> 12:23.119
and give them strength.

12:23.187 --> 12:25.121
I'm sorry,

12:25.189 --> 12:29.459
but these are the difficult
decisions I must make.

12:29.526 --> 12:31.628
And who are you to decide
who lives and who dies?

12:31.695 --> 12:33.463
The Almighty Creator?

12:33.530 --> 12:38.668
I am Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander.

12:38.736 --> 12:41.237
Wizard of the First Order.

12:41.305 --> 12:44.807
And you will wait your turn.

12:48.445 --> 12:53.116
And then your brother
put all three boxes together.

12:53.183 --> 12:55.852
And he used the power
to make the Mother Confessor

12:55.919 --> 12:58.755
beat a poor, defenseless,

12:58.822 --> 13:00.890
unarmed woman.

13:03.661 --> 13:05.328
<i>Kill her.</i>

13:07.431 --> 13:09.198
<i>Slowly.</i>

13:16.273 --> 13:18.574
Do you remember any of this?

13:18.642 --> 13:21.177
A little.

13:21.245 --> 13:23.046
Do we have to keep talking
about this?

13:23.113 --> 13:24.480
It's all so ugly.

13:24.548 --> 13:27.617
I understand.
You need to rest.

13:27.685 --> 13:29.385
I promise we won't go on
much longer.

13:29.453 --> 13:31.054
But you need to know
the truth.

13:34.658 --> 13:36.893
There were few survivors.

13:36.960 --> 13:38.928
My men who did come back

13:38.996 --> 13:41.264
told me the Seeker forced them
to collect their weapons

13:41.332 --> 13:44.600
and fight each other
to the death.

13:49.206 --> 13:51.240
It must have been so horrible.

13:52.810 --> 13:54.210
All that death.

13:56.146 --> 13:57.680
And all of them.

13:57.748 --> 14:02.452
Fathers, sons,

14:02.519 --> 14:04.987
brothers.

14:05.055 --> 14:06.723
But you...

14:06.790 --> 14:09.892
You are pristinely ungifted.

14:09.960 --> 14:11.828
Magic doesn't affect you.

14:11.895 --> 14:14.831
You were the one person
the Seeker could not control.

14:14.898 --> 14:17.333
And you saw your brother
for the monster that he is,

14:17.401 --> 14:20.403
and you bravely
pulled the boxes apart.

14:21.839 --> 14:23.139
<i>Don't touch the boxes.</i>

14:24.775 --> 14:26.909
<i>Magic doesn't work on me.</i>

14:26.977 --> 14:29.779
<i>Not even the magic of Orden.</i>

14:29.847 --> 14:32.248
<i>No!</i>

14:35.152 --> 14:38.621
And once you pulled them apart,
you ran away with two.

14:38.689 --> 14:41.624
But you must have
hidden them somewhere.

14:41.692 --> 14:44.160
But then the Seeker
came after you.

14:44.228 --> 14:47.063
And, unfortunately,
he found you before I did.

14:47.131 --> 14:48.698
<i>Where are the boxes?</i>

14:48.766 --> 14:51.067
<i>I don't have any boxes.</i>

14:54.972 --> 14:56.939
It wasn't the Seeker who hit me.

14:58.375 --> 15:00.643
He has many followers.

15:00.711 --> 15:03.346
He must've sent men after you.

15:03.414 --> 15:06.082
I can't believe
my own brother would do that.

15:08.252 --> 15:12.488
Do you remember
where you hid the boxes?

15:12.556 --> 15:14.457
Please, stop.

15:14.525 --> 15:16.325
I don't wanna think about it anymore.

15:18.695 --> 15:20.797
There, there. Shh.

15:20.864 --> 15:22.231
It's all right. You're safe now.

15:22.299 --> 15:24.500
Shh.

15:24.568 --> 15:27.236
I promise the Seeker
will never hurt you again.

15:27.304 --> 15:28.671
Shh.

16:08.512 --> 16:10.446
Kahlan, no!

16:10.514 --> 16:12.348
What's wrong?
- His neck.

16:12.416 --> 16:13.783
He has the Fire Fever.

16:13.851 --> 16:15.785
If you touch him,
you'll die.

16:20.684 --> 16:22.251
<i>One of my men</i>
<i>found him abandoned.</i>

16:22.319 --> 16:24.354
I thought he could use
a friend.

16:24.421 --> 16:27.357
Oh, he's adorable.

16:27.424 --> 16:29.258
Thank you.

16:29.326 --> 16:30.493
Oh.

16:37.001 --> 16:40.136
Baby, it's okay.

16:40.204 --> 16:43.506
I wondered if any of your
memories have returned.

16:43.574 --> 16:46.109
They're all so horrible.

16:46.176 --> 16:48.011
Maybe it's better
not to remember.

16:48.078 --> 16:49.846
Hey.

16:52.916 --> 16:54.550
I understand.

17:01.959 --> 17:04.327
What are they doing
with that D'Haran scum?

17:08.098 --> 17:10.700
What's going on here?
Stay back.

17:12.136 --> 17:15.371
I suggest you show the
Mother Confessor some courtesy.

17:15.439 --> 17:17.906
Are you all right, Zedd?

17:17.974 --> 17:20.309
A bit of rest
would do me well.

17:20.377 --> 17:22.811
What have we here?

17:22.880 --> 17:24.781
It seems Rahl neglected
to protect his own men

17:24.848 --> 17:26.582
when he sent them
to spread the sickness.

17:26.650 --> 17:29.352
The commander here
has the Fire Fever.

17:29.420 --> 17:32.755
If we deliver the Seeker's head
to Lord Rahl,

17:32.823 --> 17:34.190
we can all be cured.

17:36.293 --> 17:39.962
Can you heal him so Kahlan
can Confess him?

17:40.030 --> 17:41.531
He's the one who infected us!

17:41.598 --> 17:43.466
How dare you heal that butcher
before my son.

17:43.534 --> 17:46.469
This man might have
important information.

17:46.537 --> 17:48.404
We need him to tell us
what happened to Jennsen,

17:48.472 --> 17:49.739
the Seeker's sister.

17:49.807 --> 17:51.474
What makes her more important
than us?

17:51.542 --> 17:54.544
If we find her, we might be able
to get the cure from Rahl.

17:54.611 --> 17:56.212
But we've been waiting.

17:56.280 --> 17:58.915
You said my boy was next.

17:58.982 --> 18:03.586
I'm sorry,
but circumstances have changed.

18:03.654 --> 18:06.422
You'll have to wait
a while longer.

18:36.253 --> 18:38.554
Are you all right?

18:38.622 --> 18:43.092
Richard Cypher and his Confessor
ambushed one of my garrisons.

18:43.160 --> 18:46.195
I've just had to tell
another mother

18:46.263 --> 18:48.931
that her son has died
at the hands of the Seeker.

18:50.934 --> 18:53.770
I'm sorry.

18:53.837 --> 18:56.839
I can't believe my own brother
could be so cruel.

18:56.907 --> 18:59.542
I know exactly how you feel.

19:01.311 --> 19:03.112
He's my brother too.

19:08.852 --> 19:11.320
I didn't know
how to tell you this, Jennsen,

19:11.388 --> 19:16.025
but you, Richard and I...

19:17.494 --> 19:19.462
...share the same father.

19:22.199 --> 19:25.201
His name was Panis Rahl.

19:25.269 --> 19:29.772
There was a time when peace
and freedom prospered in D'Hara.

19:29.840 --> 19:33.609
But our father conquered
one kingdom after the other,

19:33.677 --> 19:36.913
swallowing them all up
for himself.

19:36.980 --> 19:39.115
He was a cruel

19:39.183 --> 19:42.552
and bloodthirsty tyrant.

19:42.619 --> 19:46.122
He did unspeakable things
to the people,

19:46.190 --> 19:49.826
and even his own family.

19:53.964 --> 19:56.599
I've never told this
to anyone before.

19:58.802 --> 20:00.369
Our father once boasted
to me,

20:00.437 --> 20:02.205
when I was barely as tall
as his sword,

20:02.272 --> 20:04.674
that he'd been given
a prophecy.

20:04.741 --> 20:07.577
One day he would sire
a bastard son

20:07.644 --> 20:09.679
who would rise to be the Seeker.

20:09.746 --> 20:11.414
And that Seeker would kill me.

20:11.481 --> 20:15.651
And even after he'd learned
of this prophecy,

20:15.719 --> 20:19.222
he still continued
to take countless women.

20:19.289 --> 20:21.257
My mother?

20:25.062 --> 20:28.064
From what I know of your mother,

20:28.131 --> 20:30.833
she was good,
and she was kind.

20:30.901 --> 20:33.603
She kept you safe
from our father.

20:37.140 --> 20:38.841
I was not so lucky.

20:44.781 --> 20:47.683
When I was older
and stronger,

20:47.751 --> 20:51.320
I stood up to our father,

20:51.388 --> 20:53.489
and I killed him.

20:53.557 --> 20:57.026
I reached out to Richard,
hoping that a brotherly love

20:57.094 --> 20:58.694
could avert the prophecy.

20:58.762 --> 21:00.296
But only then did I realize

21:00.364 --> 21:03.099
that he had inherited
our father's cruelty.

21:03.166 --> 21:05.768
But...

21:05.836 --> 21:08.371
...like so many villains,

21:08.438 --> 21:11.908
he believes he's a hero.

21:14.678 --> 21:16.812
But if he gets hold
of those boxes,

21:16.880 --> 21:18.681
he will do terrible things
to this world.

21:18.749 --> 21:21.417
Far worse than our father
was ever capable of.

21:21.485 --> 21:23.519
We have to stop him.

21:26.623 --> 21:28.524
How?

21:28.592 --> 21:32.795
If I could remember
where I hid the boxes,

21:32.863 --> 21:35.264
you could get to them first.

21:40.837 --> 21:43.306
Safe to Confess him now.

21:55.919 --> 21:57.586
Command me, Confessor.

21:57.654 --> 22:00.723
You were ordered to capture
a young girl.

22:00.791 --> 22:02.158
Jennsen.

22:02.225 --> 22:04.493
Where is she?
- I don't know.

22:04.561 --> 22:07.296
We captured her, but
Rahl's general took her away.

22:07.364 --> 22:09.665
Why?
- One of my men beat her

22:09.733 --> 22:12.134
because she wouldn't tell us
where the boxes were.

22:12.202 --> 22:14.570
I believe General Egremont
thought Rahl

22:14.638 --> 22:16.472
could get the information
out of her.

22:16.540 --> 22:19.041
Stay here and help Zedd.

22:22.145 --> 22:25.281
You're taking me to where
my sister was captured.

22:29.186 --> 22:31.854
Now, you must have hidden
the boxes somewhere safe.

22:31.922 --> 22:34.490
But you had to flee.

22:34.558 --> 22:38.194
Someone must've told you
the Seeker was coming after you.

22:41.264 --> 22:44.667
<i>Jennsen, you have to run.</i>

22:44.735 --> 22:46.635
The farmer who was hiding me
told me to run.

22:49.573 --> 22:51.307
Yes.

22:51.375 --> 22:52.808
You had to run.

22:54.978 --> 22:58.014
But you wouldn't have left
the boxes behind.

23:00.517 --> 23:03.085
No.

23:03.153 --> 23:05.488
I took them with me.

23:09.860 --> 23:12.528
You must have been so afraid,

23:12.596 --> 23:14.964
knowing what they would do
to you if they caught you.

23:17.267 --> 23:20.469
<i>It's a better fate</i>
<i>than if they catch you.</i>

23:20.537 --> 23:22.638
The farmer gave me
an Alkalis Stone.

23:28.378 --> 23:30.312
I tried to swallow the stone...

23:31.715 --> 23:34.784
but someone knocked me
to the ground, and I lost it.

23:42.692 --> 23:45.261
This is the exact spot
where she was captured?

23:47.297 --> 23:50.533
<i>It must have been</i>
<i>one of the Seeker's men.</i>

23:50.600 --> 23:51.967
But try to remember
what happened

23:52.035 --> 23:53.736
before you were knocked down.

23:55.939 --> 23:58.240
What did you do
with the boxes?

24:03.613 --> 24:05.347
She came through here.

24:05.415 --> 24:07.450
But she didn't have the boxes
when she was caught,

24:07.517 --> 24:09.585
so she must have hidden them
somewhere between here

24:09.653 --> 24:11.754
and the cottage.

24:11.822 --> 24:14.390
Where are they, Jennsen?

24:14.458 --> 24:15.825
<i>What did you do with them?</i>

24:15.892 --> 24:18.160
They were going to catch me.

24:18.228 --> 24:19.628
Yes, they were going
to catch you.

24:19.696 --> 24:21.864
You didn't have much time.
You had to hurry, Jennsen.

24:21.932 --> 24:24.333
But you had to get rid
of the boxes.

24:25.802 --> 24:26.869
<i>Where did you hide them?</i>

24:30.006 --> 24:32.108
I threw them in the lake.

24:35.112 --> 24:36.545
Alert the nearest garrison.

24:36.613 --> 24:38.647
Send a quad to the lake now.
- My Lord.

24:47.924 --> 24:50.359
You threw them in the lake,
didn't you?

24:55.132 --> 24:56.999
Keep this safe.

26:30.457 --> 26:33.225
Please, Wizard, don't leave us.

26:33.293 --> 26:36.361
Stay back.
I need rest.

26:36.429 --> 26:40.199
Please, stay back. Back.
Back, please.

26:40.266 --> 26:41.967
Get away from him.

26:42.035 --> 26:43.101
No, no.

26:43.169 --> 26:44.703
Save my baby!

26:47.273 --> 26:49.041
Help us.
Help me.

26:49.108 --> 26:50.609
How could you let this happen?

26:50.677 --> 26:53.145
You're hurting him!

26:57.150 --> 26:59.718
You let my son die, Wizard!

26:59.786 --> 27:02.020
No! Stop!

27:04.424 --> 27:06.825
Get back. Get away.

27:19.739 --> 27:22.508
Mistress, I've made you ill.

27:22.575 --> 27:24.510
Push the crowd back.

27:24.577 --> 27:28.313
Get away from her. Get back!

27:28.381 --> 27:30.849
We should all be ashamed.

27:30.917 --> 27:33.619
Look at what we've done
to the Confessor.

27:35.889 --> 27:37.723
Lord Rahl,

27:37.790 --> 27:39.791
the quad has failed.

27:39.859 --> 27:43.795
The Seeker has the boxes.

27:55.608 --> 27:58.210
Lord Rahl, the Seeker
has <i>The Book of Counted Shadows</i>

27:58.278 --> 27:59.945
and all three Boxes of Orden.

28:00.013 --> 28:02.881
He'll be coming for you.
You must leave this place.

28:02.949 --> 28:05.951
And where shall we go, Egremont?

28:06.019 --> 28:07.753
Where could we possibly run to

28:07.820 --> 28:09.888
that the Seeker could not
find us?

28:09.956 --> 28:11.790
He now has the power

28:11.858 --> 28:14.092
to turn my own armies
against me.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.828
And he's coming for me.

28:18.898 --> 28:23.402
Ah, there's only one thing left
that I can do.

28:27.640 --> 28:30.709
I'm sorry, Jennsen,

28:30.777 --> 28:32.678
something terrible has happened.

28:34.213 --> 28:38.383
Richard succeeded in getting
the boxes before I could.

28:40.954 --> 28:42.287
We have to run.

28:42.355 --> 28:44.756
A plague has broken out

28:44.824 --> 28:47.759
in the countryside.

28:47.827 --> 28:51.763
I can't run.
I can't abandon my people.

28:51.831 --> 28:53.665
They're dying.

28:53.733 --> 28:56.335
Somehow
I have to help them.

28:56.402 --> 28:57.936
How?

28:58.004 --> 28:59.671
My sorcerers have a cure.

28:59.739 --> 29:02.541
But now that Richard
has all the boxes,

29:02.609 --> 29:04.610
I can't go near him.

29:04.677 --> 29:06.878
No one can.

29:08.481 --> 29:09.815
Except you.

29:12.118 --> 29:14.920
Dear sister,

29:14.988 --> 29:17.322
you are the one person

29:17.390 --> 29:19.891
who can bring the cure
to these people.

29:19.959 --> 29:22.828
You're the only one
who won't be affected

29:22.895 --> 29:25.831
by magical plague
or the power of Orden.

29:25.898 --> 29:29.201
But you said the Seeker
has been hunting me for months.

29:29.268 --> 29:31.336
His men almost killed me.

29:31.404 --> 29:34.272
How could I go back to him now?

29:34.340 --> 29:37.309
Maybe if you went to him

29:37.377 --> 29:40.879
and you told him
what he wants to hear.

29:40.947 --> 29:43.815
That he's a great hero
and he was right about me.

29:43.883 --> 29:46.385
You tell him that I captured you
and I tortured you,

29:46.452 --> 29:48.487
but you would not tell me
where the boxes were.

29:48.554 --> 29:51.857
Tell him that you stole
the cure from me,

29:51.924 --> 29:55.193
and you finally escaped
and then you ran back to him.

29:55.261 --> 29:58.096
But I took the boxes from him.

29:58.164 --> 29:59.731
From everything you've told me,

29:59.799 --> 30:01.633
it doesn't sound like
he'd forgive me for that.

30:04.003 --> 30:06.004
Jennsen, I know our brother.

30:06.072 --> 30:10.142
As long as you pretend to be
on his side and not mine,

30:10.209 --> 30:11.677
he won't hurt you.

30:11.744 --> 30:14.613
All you need to remember is

30:14.681 --> 30:18.116
that he simply wants
to be loved.

30:18.184 --> 30:22.788
Tell him whatever lies
about me you have to.

30:22.855 --> 30:24.356
You tell him that I know
he has the boxes

30:24.424 --> 30:25.824
and I am coming for them.

30:25.892 --> 30:27.793
And I'll place a magical
tracer cloud on them

30:27.860 --> 30:29.394
to make it more convincing.

30:29.462 --> 30:32.564
Then, when you have his trust
and he turns his back on you,

30:32.632 --> 30:34.633
you bring the boxes
back to me.

30:40.440 --> 30:43.208
I know what you're thinking.

30:43.276 --> 30:46.378
What if I'm not telling
the truth?

30:46.446 --> 30:47.713
You've lost your memories.

30:47.780 --> 30:49.247
How would you know
if I was lying or not?

30:49.315 --> 30:50.916
How can you be sure of anything?

30:52.418 --> 30:55.153
What if this were just...

30:55.221 --> 30:57.189
...some sort of ploy?

31:01.227 --> 31:04.896
Jennsen,

31:04.964 --> 31:08.734
if I were the cruel tyrant

31:08.801 --> 31:11.103
that Richard paints me as,

31:11.170 --> 31:13.705
why would
I want to save people?

31:15.742 --> 31:17.142
I don't know.

31:18.878 --> 31:22.547
I would give anything
not to have to ask this of you,

31:22.615 --> 31:26.118
but my people are dying.

31:30.890 --> 31:33.291
So if you take my fastest horse
and ride through the night,

31:33.359 --> 31:35.861
you can make it to where
the people are suffering.

31:35.928 --> 31:37.963
And when you give the cure
to the ailing

31:38.030 --> 31:40.132
and you see that it works,
you will know which brother

31:40.199 --> 31:42.300
truly cares for the people.

31:45.071 --> 31:49.040
And you will know
which brother to side with.

31:54.514 --> 31:56.648
I have the boxes.

32:07.193 --> 32:08.593
My mistress is dying.

32:24.657 --> 32:28.327
She confessed a sick man
to save me.

32:28.394 --> 32:30.796
How long until you recover?

32:30.863 --> 32:34.633
I was already weakened
before the mob overcame me.

32:34.701 --> 32:37.869
The Fire Fever
has me now, Richard.

32:37.937 --> 32:40.405
I'm not going to recover.

32:42.675 --> 32:44.643
Zedd, I'm not going to let
either of you die.

32:55.288 --> 32:57.389
I'm going to force Rahl
to give me the cure.

32:57.457 --> 32:59.491
How?

32:59.559 --> 33:02.260
I'm going to put
the Boxes of Orden together.

33:04.163 --> 33:08.700
Kahlan is too weak
to Confess you.

33:08.768 --> 33:11.636
You've seen what the boxes
can do to you.

33:11.704 --> 33:15.107
You have to find
another Confessor,

33:15.174 --> 33:16.608
go on without us.

33:16.676 --> 33:17.976
No.

33:18.044 --> 33:19.511
You two will have to go on
without me.

33:26.552 --> 33:28.920
I'm going to find Rahl.

33:28.988 --> 33:30.956
Then I'll swallow
the Alkalis Stone

33:31.024 --> 33:32.924
just before
I put the boxes together.

33:32.992 --> 33:36.028
And with the power of Orden,
I'll command Rahl

33:36.095 --> 33:38.530
to send the cure
back to the valley,

33:38.598 --> 33:41.033
and then I'll kill him.

33:41.100 --> 33:44.202
And before I can turn
into a tyrant,

33:44.270 --> 33:46.872
the Alkalis Stone will kill me.

33:46.939 --> 33:48.006
Richard, th--

33:48.074 --> 33:50.475
There must be another way.

33:50.543 --> 33:53.111
It's the only way.

33:53.179 --> 33:57.015
He'll be dead and I'll be dead,

33:57.083 --> 33:58.683
and everyone else will live.

34:01.754 --> 34:02.888
Dear boy...

34:07.994 --> 34:11.797
The prophecy says the Seeker
will defeat Rahl.

34:11.864 --> 34:13.899
It doesn't say he will live
to be a wise old man

34:13.966 --> 34:16.168
like his grandfather.

34:29.047 --> 34:31.016
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.

34:31.083 --> 34:33.150
Jennsen.

34:44.030 --> 34:45.330
I can't believe it's you.

34:45.398 --> 34:47.498
Where have you been?

34:47.567 --> 34:48.833
Are you all right?

34:48.900 --> 34:50.802
I was captured by Rahl.

34:50.870 --> 34:52.103
He tortured me,

34:52.170 --> 34:55.474
but I wouldn't tell him
where I hid the boxes.

34:55.541 --> 34:59.244
You were right about him.

34:59.312 --> 35:01.513
Before I escaped,

35:01.581 --> 35:03.281
I stole the cure
for the plague.

35:05.118 --> 35:07.853
We don't have much time,
Richard.

35:07.920 --> 35:11.289
Rahl knows
you have all the boxes.

35:11.357 --> 35:14.693
Look. The tracer cloud

35:14.760 --> 35:16.528
is leading his men here
right now.

35:18.164 --> 35:20.665
If I hold the boxes,

35:20.733 --> 35:22.868
the cloud can't track them.

35:30.409 --> 35:32.444
Zedd and Kahlan are sick.

35:32.512 --> 35:33.678
I have to give them
the cure.

35:59.238 --> 36:02.174
Their welts are disappearing.
It's working.

36:04.177 --> 36:06.678
Jennsen?

36:12.151 --> 36:13.818
Jennsen!

36:13.886 --> 36:15.253
Jennsen!

36:19.585 --> 36:22.054
Jennsen.

36:22.121 --> 36:24.122
Jennsen.

36:26.526 --> 36:28.060
No! Help!

36:28.127 --> 36:29.995
He has me!
I'm over here!

36:30.063 --> 36:31.229
Hey, hey. Shh.

36:31.297 --> 36:33.999
Jennsen.
What are you doing? Stop.

36:34.067 --> 36:36.268
Stop. Stop.

36:38.271 --> 36:42.507
I'm gonna take my hand away,
but you can't scream, okay?

36:42.575 --> 36:44.209
Please, don't hurt me.

36:44.277 --> 36:46.845
Hurt you?

36:46.913 --> 36:49.448
I'd never hurt you.

36:49.515 --> 36:50.682
Why would you say that?

36:53.352 --> 36:55.087
Where were you going
with the boxes?

36:56.823 --> 36:59.791
I'm taking them back
to Lord Rahl, where they belong.

37:01.394 --> 37:03.562
If you take them back to Rahl,
we're all dead.

37:03.629 --> 37:06.098
He told me you'd say that.

37:10.403 --> 37:12.237
Whatever he told you,
it's a lie.

37:16.275 --> 37:18.176
Did you put
the Boxes of Orden together

37:18.244 --> 37:19.778
and force people
to kill each other?

37:24.917 --> 37:26.284
Let me go.

37:32.291 --> 37:34.426
What's happened to you?

37:34.494 --> 37:38.930
Lord Rahl took care of me
after your men almost killed me.

37:38.998 --> 37:40.532
My men?

37:40.600 --> 37:42.033
They beat me so badly,

37:42.101 --> 37:43.635
I couldn't even remember
my own name.

37:46.906 --> 37:48.206
Jennsen, don't you see?

37:48.274 --> 37:50.542
Rahl's filled your head
with lies.

37:50.610 --> 37:54.446
I'm not the villain.

37:54.514 --> 37:57.015
He said you'd say that too.

38:04.257 --> 38:05.791
Jennsen, look at my eyes.

38:08.861 --> 38:10.562
Do you remember
how we first met?

38:10.630 --> 38:15.000
I rescued you and our mother.
Do you remember that?

38:16.335 --> 38:17.836
No! Defend the box.

38:17.904 --> 38:21.173
Our mother was captured
by a Mord-Sith

38:21.240 --> 38:22.874
sent by Darken Rahl.

38:24.577 --> 38:26.478
<i>Stop!</i>

38:26.546 --> 38:29.548
We tried to save her,
together.

38:29.615 --> 38:31.616
Yes, Jennsen,

38:31.684 --> 38:33.652
<i>I did use</i>
<i>the power of Orden.</i>

38:33.719 --> 38:35.720
<i>Richard, no!</i>

38:35.788 --> 38:38.089
<i>But everything I did--</i>
<i>- Kill them all!</i>

38:39.759 --> 38:41.393
<i>--I did to save our mother.</i>

38:41.460 --> 38:42.994
<i>Stop!</i>

38:43.062 --> 38:45.130
<i>If that is your wish, My Lord.</i>

38:46.666 --> 38:48.433
<i>Take us to our mother.</i>

38:48.501 --> 38:49.668
<i>Yes, My Lord.</i>

38:52.038 --> 38:54.906
If Darken Rahl gets this box,
we'd all be his slaves.

38:54.974 --> 38:58.243
<i>I don't even know you.</i>
<i>Why should I listen to you?</i>

38:58.311 --> 39:00.111
Because he's the Seeker.

39:00.179 --> 39:02.214
I am your grandfather.

39:02.281 --> 39:04.683
<i>That woman Denna is
torturing is your mother too.</i>

39:06.252 --> 39:08.854
It wasn't you.
It was the power of Orden.

39:08.921 --> 39:11.323
What'd I do?
I know this isn't you.

39:11.390 --> 39:14.526
<i>The way of the Seeker</i>
<i>is not vengeance.</i>

39:14.594 --> 39:17.562
<i>We'll come see you again.</i>
<i>And be together, as a family.</i>

39:17.630 --> 39:20.398
When you smile,
right around the eyes

39:20.466 --> 39:23.301
you look
just like our mother.

39:33.079 --> 39:35.847
I remember...

39:35.915 --> 39:38.116
...everything.

39:46.325 --> 39:49.261
Richard.

40:30.703 --> 40:32.804
My Lord,

40:32.872 --> 40:34.539
you've received
another report.

40:34.607 --> 40:37.242
The pristinely ungifted one

40:37.310 --> 40:39.978
has sided with the Seeker
once more.

40:40.046 --> 40:42.347
He has the boxes.

40:49.956 --> 40:51.623
Pull back my armies
before he has a chance

40:51.691 --> 40:53.892
to turn them against me.

40:53.960 --> 40:56.895
And, Egremont,

40:56.963 --> 41:00.432
have Mistress Cara gather
her sisters of the Agiel.

41:00.499 --> 41:04.436
My Lord, perhaps you could
negotiate a truce

41:04.503 --> 41:05.637
with the Seeker.

41:07.940 --> 41:11.476
It's far too late for that.

41:11.544 --> 41:13.511
Jennsen.

41:16.315 --> 41:17.782
We missed you.

41:17.850 --> 41:19.351
Where were you?

41:20.353 --> 41:21.820
What?

41:21.887 --> 41:23.421
I took a bolt in that shoulder.

41:26.058 --> 41:28.326
Oh, I can heal a little...

41:28.394 --> 41:30.128
...pinprick like that
in no time.

41:30.196 --> 41:31.663
Pinprick?

41:31.731 --> 41:34.232
Did I mention I had to rip
the bolt out of my own shoulder?

41:34.300 --> 41:37.002
What do you want me to do?
Conjure you some sort of award?

41:40.606 --> 41:43.708
Kahlan still needs a little time
to regain her strength,

41:43.776 --> 41:46.111
but she's asking for you.

42:05.765 --> 42:08.867
I thought
I was going to lose you.

42:13.839 --> 42:15.840
Did you get the boxes?

42:15.908 --> 42:17.976
Yes.

42:20.413 --> 42:22.814
Then it's almost over.

42:26.585 --> 42:28.453
There is one more thing.

42:33.926 --> 42:35.460
What is it, Richard?

42:39.532 --> 42:42.901
You have to Confess me.

42:46.238 --> 42:48.807
