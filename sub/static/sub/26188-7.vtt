DOORBELL RINGS

00:44.100 --> 00:45.184
When?

00:45.184 --> 00:47.296
Yesterday.

00:47.296 --> 00:50.240
Police have been and gone.

00:50.240 --> 00:53.696
What was taken?

00:53.696 --> 01:04.192
Not sure.

01:04.192 --> 01:07.328
And that.

01:07.328 --> 01:09.120
It's still here.

01:09.120 --> 01:21.664
But not where I left it.

01:21.664 --> 01:23.776
MARK VINER:I keep telling you,

01:23.776 --> 01:27.424
you don't have
the appropriate legal authority.

01:27.424 --> 01:30.432

01:30.432 --> 01:37.472
I was a driver for a lawyer once,
named Blake Gaines.

01:37.472 --> 01:39.264
Does that help?

01:39.264 --> 01:42.016
Only if you want him
to represent you in court.

01:42.016 --> 01:43.360
He is dead.

01:43.360 --> 01:47.328
WHEEZES

01:47.328 --> 01:50.144
You are dying, old man?

01:50.144 --> 01:53.408
Does it look as if I am?

01:53.408 --> 01:58.272
No.

01:58.272 --> 02:01.472
You are dead...

02:01.472 --> 02:02.880
...already.

Turns out it is not so safe.

04:10.816 --> 04:12.736
Snap.

04:12.736 --> 04:14.592
Where?
Kate's house.

04:14.592 --> 04:16.000
The office.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.600
What did they get?

04:17.600 --> 04:22.784
A hard drive,
with a copy of your tape on it.

04:22.784 --> 04:25.920
Where's the original?

04:25.920 --> 04:27.136
With Frank.

04:27.136 --> 04:31.360
Safe?Says so.

04:31.360 --> 04:34.432
Mark Viner?

04:34.432 --> 04:37.380
Eve used to work for him?

04:37.380 --> 04:39.744
Burned to death.

04:39.744 --> 04:40.832
Accident?

04:40.832 --> 04:42.624
They say.

04:42.624 --> 04:45.312
He had oxygen tanks.

04:45.312 --> 04:47.744
But...I don't know, Alice.

04:47.744 --> 04:50.944
Something tells me,
if you're going to make this speech,

04:50.944 --> 05:08.224
you'd better hurry up and make it.

05:08.224 --> 05:10.464
DAVID RUNIHURA:Your mother's file.

05:10.464 --> 05:13.088
We are managing to locate
everything we need,

05:13.088 --> 05:16.352
except for one article.

05:16.352 --> 05:45.024
This.

05:45.024 --> 05:49.632
That is the number for a file
we cannot find.

05:49.632 --> 06:07.232
When you return to London,
might you perhaps take another look?

06:07.232 --> 06:10.112
KATE: Two days before my mother
left for The Hague,

06:10.112 --> 06:12.608
she came here

06:12.608 --> 06:15.872
and took something
out of that Ganimana file.

06:15.872 --> 06:18.112
Hmmm.

06:18.112 --> 06:24.192
Whatever it is, that's what Runihura
wants me to find.

06:24.192 --> 06:25.536
What is it?

06:25.536 --> 06:48.960
Where is it?

06:48.960 --> 07:02.144
CAMERA MICROPHONE CRACKLING

07:02.144 --> 07:05.792
Why is everyone always wearing black
     around here these days?

07:05.792 --> 07:07.968
Mark Viner's funeral.

07:07.968 --> 07:09.696
Oh.

07:09.696 --> 07:12.384
It went OK?

07:12.384 --> 07:14.560
I think I'm getting used to them.

07:14.560 --> 07:15.776
Mm.

07:15.776 --> 07:17.632
Oh, I got you a new set of these.

07:17.632 --> 07:24.352
Right.

07:24.352 --> 07:29.984
What are you looking for?

07:29.984 --> 07:32.544
Two days before she left
for The Hague,

07:32.544 --> 07:36.576
my mother visited Mark Viner
and took out some kind of document.

07:36.576 --> 07:38.496
The night before she went,

07:38.496 --> 07:40.992
the thing that ignited that massive
row between us

07:40.992 --> 07:44.896
was when she found me
looking at the Nyamoya file -

07:44.896 --> 07:46.688
this file -

07:46.688 --> 07:49.440
on her desk.

07:49.440 --> 07:53.920
And a couple of days after that,
she was dead.

07:53.920 --> 07:56.288
That's what I'm looking for.

07:56.288 --> 07:59.296
That document.

07:59.296 --> 08:01.664
And it turns out...

08:01.664 --> 08:04.864
..so is David Runihura.

08:04.864 --> 08:06.720
And where's Captain Congo?

08:06.720 --> 08:08.580
Don't say that.

08:08.580 --> 08:10.048
Sorry.

08:10.048 --> 08:14.016
I didn't know you thought that
much...Just don't call him that.

08:14.016 --> 08:15.744
OK.

08:15.744 --> 08:18.560
So, where is he?

08:18.560 --> 08:20.352
I don't know!

08:20.352 --> 08:22.912
I thought he worked for you.
He does,

08:22.912 --> 08:25.920
but not on a punch card.
Well, he's not with Kate!

08:25.920 --> 08:30.336
Well, he must be onto something.

08:30.336 --> 08:31.620
Do you trust him?

08:31.620 --> 08:33.984
Michael.

08:33.984 --> 08:36.672
I'm the only family he's got.

08:36.672 --> 08:39.872
He may go his own way,
but he'll always come home.

08:39.872 --> 08:41.472
Why do you ask?

08:41.472 --> 08:45.184
Well, it's just that these days
everyone seems so full of surprises.

08:45.184 --> 08:47.872
Even you.

08:47.872 --> 08:55.808
PHONE RINGS

08:55.808 --> 08:57.152
Are you OK?

08:57.152 --> 09:02.340

pork and beans I'm going to scream.

09:02.340 --> 09:03.616
HE LAUGHS

09:03.616 --> 09:07.072
OK.
You know that recipe I gave you?

09:07.072 --> 09:09.120
I can't wait to have it again.

09:09.120 --> 09:10.592
You can.

09:10.592 --> 09:11.872
Soon as you get home.

09:11.872 --> 09:13.280
Great.

09:13.280 --> 09:16.800
Do not lose it.
It is the only one I have.

09:16.800 --> 09:19.040
Understood.

09:19.040 --> 09:22.304
And then there is the one that you
are going to cook up for yourself.

09:22.304 --> 09:24.544
How is it going?

09:24.544 --> 09:26.784
(SIGHS)Complicated.

09:26.784 --> 09:31.392
But I get it right, it is going to
earn me a Michelin star.

09:31.392 --> 09:33.312
Rich tastes!

09:33.312 --> 09:35.744
Oh, baby.

09:35.744 --> 09:43.232
That's me.

NEWSREADER:Rwanda today finally
delivered its indictment to the UK
government

10:38.912 --> 10:42.176
requesting the immediate extradition
      of Patrice Ganimana,

10:42.176 --> 10:45.312
accused participant
in the Rwandan genocide.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.872
Because of the indictment's
precise details,

10:47.872 --> 10:50.880
the Rwandan government are confident
 the UK will have little choice

10:50.880 --> 10:54.720
but to fall in line with Canada
and other European countries

10:54.720 --> 10:57.728
who have recently granted
similar extradition requests.

10:57.728 --> 10:59.072
Mr Zand.

10:59.072 --> 11:01.824
We have now had the opportunity
to study, in detail,

11:01.824 --> 11:06.688
the indictment presented by the CPS
on behalf of the government of
Rwanda

11:06.688 --> 11:12.832
alleging my client's participation
in the Rwandan genocide of 1994.

11:12.832 --> 11:16.352
And I am now in a position to state,
         categorically,

11:16.352 --> 11:20.192
that my client, Patrice Ganimana,
has no case to answer,

11:20.192 --> 11:22.560
due to the simple and absolute truth

11:22.560 --> 11:24.864
that he was not in Rwanda
at the time

11:24.864 --> 11:32.608
that these accusations
are alleged to have taken place.

11:32.608 --> 11:35.552
But I'm not even going to lose
consciousness.

11:35.552 --> 11:38.048
I'm not aware of the exact
nature of your procedure.

11:38.048 --> 11:41.888
It's an ultrasound, darling, for
my left ovary - it says so right
there.

11:41.888 --> 11:43.488
I still need a next of kin.

11:43.488 --> 11:45.216
I don't have a next of kin.

11:45.216 --> 11:47.136
Husband, children?

11:47.136 --> 11:48.992
PHONE RINGS
Parents? Sibling?

11:48.992 --> 11:50.784
Now you're just making me sad.

11:50.784 --> 11:53.856
Michael, would you please be my next
of kin, so Nurse Ratched here

11:53.856 --> 11:57.184
can check off her box?
Turn on CN56.

11:57.184 --> 11:58.592
Give me the remote.

11:58.592 --> 12:00.512
Excuse me?

12:00.512 --> 12:04.032
Sweetheart, you can't spend your
whole life watching Catching Kelce.

12:04.032 --> 12:06.272
The remote!

12:06.272 --> 12:07.744
Today!

12:07.744 --> 12:19.456
Thank you.

12:19.456 --> 12:21.504
REPORTER:Having made
the sensational claim,

12:21.504 --> 12:25.024
Mr Ganimana's barrister then offered
  to submit supporting evidence

12:25.024 --> 12:27.904
including witness statements
claiming that

12:27.904 --> 12:31.552
his client had fled Rwanda
in July 1992

12:31.552 --> 12:34.880
and taken refuge in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo,

12:34.880 --> 12:40.128
then known as Zaire, some two years
before the Rwandan genocide.

12:40.128 --> 12:43.776
If correct, this could prove a huge
and embarrassing stumble,

12:43.776 --> 12:45.504
not only for the government of
Rwanda

12:45.504 --> 12:48.512
but for the Crown Prosecution
Service here in the UK

12:48.512 --> 12:53.440
and for the progress of
international justice worldwide,

12:53.440 --> 12:55.616
because if the case is thrown out,

12:55.616 --> 12:59.072
all charges against Patrice Ganimana
        will be dropped.

12:59.072 --> 13:00.480
Shhhhit.
Andrew McCulloch,

13:00.480 --> 13:07.392
Westminster Magistrates' Court,
London.

13:07.392 --> 13:09.824
Got him!
MICHAEL:What?

13:09.824 --> 13:11.680
I gotta go. I got a scan.

13:11.680 --> 13:13.856
A what?
A procedure.

13:13.856 --> 13:17.120
Jesus. Is everyone in my world ill?

13:17.120 --> 13:20.064
Yeah, well, call it a symptom
of collective guilt.

13:20.064 --> 13:22.816
I thought you didn't believe in
that.Well, now I do.

13:22.816 --> 13:27.744
And now I have the cure.

13:27.744 --> 13:29.792
What's going on?!

13:29.792 --> 13:32.608
He was clearly there!

13:32.608 --> 13:35.424
Look!

13:35.424 --> 13:41.952
Look!

13:41.952 --> 13:46.176
Look!

13:46.176 --> 13:49.504
It'll all depend on the credibility
of the witnesses...

13:49.504 --> 13:50.720
Take your pick!

13:50.720 --> 13:57.760
..for the defence, who are willing
to testify he wasn't in Rwanda.

13:57.760 --> 14:00.832
Who?

14:00.832 --> 14:03.648
But they must have some mighty big
rabbit in their hat

14:03.648 --> 14:06.400
or they wouldn't try this trick.

14:06.400 --> 14:11.904
So we need a rebuttal witness
to state he was there.

14:11.904 --> 14:15.232
Yeah, we do.

14:15.232 --> 14:18.496
One so reliable,
they couldn't possibly dismiss.

14:18.496 --> 14:20.544
Then isn't it lucky you've got me?

14:20.544 --> 14:21.632
MICHAEL:You?

14:21.632 --> 14:24.192
There's good news
and there's bad news.

14:24.192 --> 14:26.688
First, the good news.

14:26.688 --> 14:28.864
The little shit has slipped up

14:28.864 --> 14:31.104
and I'm the one to rub
it in his face.

14:31.104 --> 14:32.448
How?

14:32.448 --> 14:35.968
The indictments range from
1992 to 1994.

14:35.968 --> 14:39.616
And his lawyer says that he had
already left the country by then.

14:39.616 --> 14:42.048
Well, unlucky for him,

14:42.048 --> 14:43.456
I hadn't.

14:43.456 --> 14:47.552
Because that's when I met him -
and I've got the evidence to prove
it.

14:47.552 --> 14:52.864
So whoever they think they've got
to say that he wasn't there, we've
got

14:52.864 --> 14:56.256
the Assistant Secretary,
Bureau of African Affairs,

14:56.256 --> 15:00.928
US State Department to say that he
was.

15:00.928 --> 15:02.976
I'd say that's a Top Trump,
wouldn't you?!

15:02.976 --> 15:05.024
I didn't know you cared.

15:05.024 --> 15:08.416
I only care about
things I can do something about.

15:08.416 --> 15:10.272
And now I can do something about
this.

15:10.272 --> 15:11.424
Huh!

15:11.424 --> 15:13.344
That's the good news.

15:13.344 --> 15:15.136
And the bad news?

15:15.136 --> 15:16.544
There's a clock on this.

15:16.544 --> 15:18.016
Yes, there is.

15:18.016 --> 15:20.256
No, I mean on me.

15:20.256 --> 15:26.336
Gotten me a complex ovarian cyst
that measures 12 centimetres across.

15:26.336 --> 15:29.792
Kinda like that asteroid
they sent Bruce Willis to deal with.

15:29.792 --> 15:33.632
Maybe that's what I ought to do -
get him in there, blow the fucker
up.

15:33.632 --> 15:36.704
(LAUGHS)That's a thought.
Anyway,

15:36.704 --> 15:40.096
they've gotta go in, abdominally.

15:40.096 --> 15:41.760
Sorry to hear that.

15:41.760 --> 15:44.768
And, like, tomorrow, really.

15:44.768 --> 15:46.496
Right.

15:46.496 --> 15:49.056
Well, what do you want to do?

15:49.056 --> 15:51.232
Well, I've put them off.

15:51.232 --> 15:54.304
I want you to arrange
for me to give a sworn statement

15:54.304 --> 15:56.032
via video-link to the police.

15:56.032 --> 15:58.016
Well, we could wait till after.

15:58.016 --> 16:00.448
You're not getting me, are you,
Mikey?

16:00.448 --> 16:03.072
What?
This is it.

16:03.072 --> 16:05.376
This is what we've been waiting for.

16:05.376 --> 16:07.872
I'm about to say out
loud, under oath,

16:07.872 --> 16:10.944
what no-one has been able to say
for over 20 years.

16:10.944 --> 16:14.784
Not me, not Eve,
not Alice, not you. None of us.

16:14.784 --> 16:16.576
But now we can.

16:16.576 --> 16:20.928
And all because Patrice Ganimana
just made a spectacular fuck-up.

16:20.928 --> 16:22.400
Who'd have thought it?

16:22.400 --> 16:24.960
So tell Alice to pack her bags
pronto.

16:24.960 --> 16:30.912
She's going home!

16:30.912 --> 16:34.944
MAN:You don't need me to tell you
that almost every electronic device

16:34.944 --> 16:39.424
you touch, watch or travel in
has a tantalum capacitor within it.

16:39.424 --> 16:43.328
You don't need me to tell you
that the coltan in this region

16:43.328 --> 16:44.544
is second to none.

16:44.544 --> 16:48.000
You don't need me to tell you
that since the implementation of

16:48.000 --> 16:51.968
the Dodd-Frank Act, the supply line
between our mines,
into this country,

16:51.968 --> 16:55.488
to the world beyond,
are certified conflict-free.

16:55.488 --> 16:57.216
Guaranteed.

16:57.216 --> 17:01.312
And you don't need me to tell you
what that's done for this region.

17:01.312 --> 17:06.048
But you do need me to tell you this.

17:06.048 --> 17:08.224
It's not making us rich.

17:08.224 --> 17:11.616
It's making other people rich.

17:11.616 --> 17:15.456
People in Germany,
Kazakhstan, China.

17:15.456 --> 17:20.256
People who buy our ore
at rock-bottom prices,

17:20.256 --> 17:25.504
refine it, and sell it on
at double the profit.

17:25.504 --> 17:27.424
Until now.

17:27.424 --> 17:29.792
Because in 18 months' time,

17:29.792 --> 17:34.464
the first tantalum refinery
will be up and running here.

17:34.464 --> 17:37.344
And 18 months after that, another.

17:37.344 --> 17:39.136
And then another.

17:39.136 --> 17:41.824
Until the time comes,
and I believe it will,

17:41.824 --> 17:47.584
when this country becomes the
leading tantalum powder exporter in
the world,

17:47.584 --> 17:52.384
widening your profits by
hundreds of millions of dollars,

17:52.384 --> 17:56.672
whilst bringing about an equally
dramatic reduction in your trade
deficit.

17:56.672 --> 17:59.424
This is your economy.

17:59.424 --> 18:01.728
Your future.

18:01.728 --> 18:05.184
And moment by moment, day by day,

18:05.184 --> 18:07.552
year by year,

18:07.552 --> 18:10.752
you are taking control of it.

18:10.752 --> 18:13.312
We're proud to be along for the
ride.

18:13.312 --> 18:22.272
Thank you.

18:22.272 --> 18:39.104
CHEERING

18:39.104 --> 18:42.752
Of course, he will be making a few
million out of it too...

18:42.752 --> 18:46.784
LAUGHTER

18:46.784 --> 18:50.496
You know, recently we had a report
written about our judiciary.

18:50.496 --> 18:53.056
It says we need assistance.

18:53.056 --> 18:56.448
Apparently, we do not pay
our defence counsels enough.

18:56.448 --> 18:59.200
Maybe this...

18:59.200 --> 19:01.120
..will help.

19:01.120 --> 19:03.040
Actually, I'm serious.

19:03.040 --> 19:05.344
I think it will.

19:05.344 --> 19:07.904
And I have got no problem with that.

19:07.904 --> 19:14.432
I have got no problem with anything
that stops us being subservient to
anyone.

19:14.432 --> 19:17.952
Because we don't need to be.

19:17.952 --> 19:21.540
Recently, our friend Alice Munezero

19:21.540 --> 19:23.584
defeated the French in their own
court,

19:23.584 --> 19:28.384
and she was poisoned for it
by someone, or some country.

19:28.384 --> 19:30.112
You know who I'm talking about.

19:30.112 --> 19:32.224
AUDIENCE AGREES
Mmm.

19:32.224 --> 19:36.192
And at this moment also
there is a bad African in the UK

19:36.192 --> 19:39.008
trying to worm his way out of his
destiny.

19:39.008 --> 19:40.544
He won't.

19:40.544 --> 19:42.912
He will be sent here, I know it.

19:42.912 --> 19:45.344
Because what we are doing here...

19:45.344 --> 19:47.008
..with that line...

19:47.008 --> 19:49.184
..we are doing there,

19:49.184 --> 19:52.256
with our law.

19:52.256 --> 19:55.456
And we are doing it right.

19:55.456 --> 19:57.060
So don't worry about it.

19:57.060 --> 19:58.720
Leave it to me.

19:58.720 --> 20:02.816
We're going to be fine.

20:02.816 --> 20:16.832
CHEERING

20:16.832 --> 20:24.704
TRANSLATED FROM KINYARWANDA

20:24.704 --> 20:28.160
What if she uses the opportunity?
To do what?

20:28.160 --> 20:29.824
To speak against you.

20:29.824 --> 20:36.672
And why would she do that?

20:36.672 --> 20:39.744
FOOTSTEPS

20:39.744 --> 20:42.432
DAVID:We have been watching her.

20:42.432 --> 20:44.032
BIBI: And what have you seen?

20:44.032 --> 20:48.576
DAVID:Mmm, not sure, but until we
are, I don't think she should speak.

20:48.576 --> 20:51.584
BIBI: I don't care.
DAVID:Because she's your sister?

20:51.584 --> 20:53.376
BIBI: She's not my sister.

20:53.376 --> 21:01.248
DAVID:Close.

21:01.248 --> 21:03.616
And do you think that might make
you...

21:03.616 --> 21:04.640
What?

21:04.640 --> 21:05.984
Blind.

21:05.984 --> 21:07.776
Because why?

21:07.776 --> 21:09.376
If you care for someone...

21:09.376 --> 21:14.304
It makes you blind?

21:14.304 --> 21:19.808
There was a time you loved me.

21:19.808 --> 21:24.032
Did that make you blind?

21:24.032 --> 21:26.656
I want only what is best for the
country.

21:26.656 --> 21:28.512
For the country?

21:28.512 --> 21:32.160
Or for me?

21:32.160 --> 21:34.980
You are the country.

21:34.980 --> 21:37.856
Ah.

21:37.856 --> 21:41.952
Then you really don't see me.

21:41.952 --> 21:46.816
FOOTSTEPS RECEDING

21:46.816 --> 21:54.304
BARKED ORDER

21:54.304 --> 21:56.480
Let Alice speak.

21:56.480 --> 22:07.424
She wants the world to see her.

22:07.424 --> 22:08.896
They've agreed.

22:08.896 --> 22:10.816
The MPS will interview her.

22:10.816 --> 22:12.992
Eunice will go to a police station
in Washington

22:12.992 --> 22:16.384
and they'll do it via video-link.
When?

22:16.384 --> 22:18.496
4pm tomorrow, GMT.

22:18.496 --> 22:21.952
About the same time you land.

22:21.952 --> 22:24.576
No backing out, then.

22:24.576 --> 22:29.568
You want to?

22:29.568 --> 22:33.152
Just...

22:33.152 --> 22:37.376
..been so long.

22:37.376 --> 22:40.576
You don't have to do it.

22:40.576 --> 22:52.096
I am the only one who can.

22:52.096 --> 22:54.528
You will be there for me, Mikey?

22:54.528 --> 22:55.620
Every step.

22:55.620 --> 22:57.024
And you will call Frank?

22:57.024 --> 23:00.420
He's on standby, he knows.

23:00.420 --> 23:02.144
I have to have it.

23:02.144 --> 23:05.024
You will. He'll be there.

23:05.024 --> 23:07.264
It'll be fine.

23:27.104 --> 23:29.792
TRANSLATED FROM KINYARWANDA

23:29.792 --> 24:31.744
I am not going out
until my husband arrives.

24:31.744 --> 24:38.016
CAMERA WHIRS

24:38.016 --> 24:40.256
Mrs Clayton, can you hear me?

24:40.256 --> 24:42.180
Yes.
And can you see me?

24:42.180 --> 24:43.328
I can.

24:43.328 --> 24:45.952
You are about to make
a sworn witness statement

24:45.952 --> 24:47.872
with regard to the matter of

24:47.872 --> 24:50.432
the government of Rwanda
versus Patrice Ganimana.

24:50.432 --> 24:52.416
Is that correct?
It is.

24:52.416 --> 24:55.744
For the record,
if you could just identify yourself.

24:55.744 --> 24:58.816
In public life, I'm Assistant
Secretary,

24:58.816 --> 25:02.400
Bureau of African Affairs,
US State Department.

25:02.400 --> 25:04.448
But today, I'm appearing before you

25:04.448 --> 25:08.032
entirely in the capacity
as a private citizen.

25:08.032 --> 25:11.424
Between 1987 and 1998

25:11.424 --> 25:15.780
I worked as a field officer for
the John Hopkinson Refugee Relief
Fund.

25:15.780 --> 25:19.552
I was first posted in Rwanda in 1990

25:19.552 --> 25:23.584
at the beginning of the civil war
between the then Hutu government

25:23.584 --> 25:27.616
and the returning Tutsi-led RPF.

25:27.616 --> 25:31.584
During this period,
government forces and other militia

25:31.584 --> 25:35.424
began rounding up Tutsi communities
-

25:35.424 --> 25:37.216
some to be massacred,

25:37.216 --> 25:41.824
others held in parks and stadiums
in the most harrowing conditions.

25:41.824 --> 25:45.152
On February 15th 1993,

25:45.152 --> 25:48.544
as I was trying to coordinate the
delivery of relief aid,

25:48.544 --> 25:51.360
I personally met with
Patrice Ganimana

25:51.360 --> 25:55.200
when he and a large number
of FAR government soldiers

25:55.200 --> 25:57.440
arrived to block our supplies.

25:57.440 --> 25:59.296
He did not let us pass

25:59.296 --> 26:03.968
and soldiers under his direct
command had us forcibly
removed from the area.

26:03.968 --> 26:07.040
And we understand
you have corroborating material.

26:07.040 --> 26:11.776
I do.

26:11.776 --> 26:16.320
This is the arrest sheet made out at
the police station to which we were
taken,

26:16.320 --> 26:20.096
which clearly cites Patrice Ganimana
as the commanding officer.

26:20.096 --> 26:23.296
I offer this information
in direct rebuttal

26:23.296 --> 26:25.536
to the statement
made by Ganimana's lawyer

26:25.536 --> 26:28.928
that he had already fled the country
by this point.

26:28.928 --> 26:30.784
He had not.

26:30.784 --> 26:33.344
He was present, he was involved,

26:33.344 --> 26:35.648
and I am a witness to that fact.

26:35.648 --> 26:38.656
We'll need that sheet copied
and certified.

26:38.656 --> 26:40.128
Of course.

26:40.128 --> 26:42.752
But there's something else
I'd like to say.

26:42.752 --> 26:48.000
That was not the last time
I saw Patrice Ganimana.

26:48.000 --> 27:02.720
I've a prepared statement
which I'll read, if I may.

27:02.720 --> 27:07.968
The genocide of '94, it has no
comparison.

27:07.968 --> 27:11.232
800,000 Tutsis, at least,

27:11.232 --> 27:13.216
murdered within 100 days.

27:13.216 --> 27:20.448
The most intensive ethnic slaughter
in modern history.

27:20.448 --> 27:23.776
The RPF ended that genocide,
no doubt.

27:23.776 --> 27:27.552
And no doubt either,
they did not cause it.

27:27.552 --> 27:31.776
It was coordinated by a desperate
group within the Hutu government

27:31.776 --> 27:34.528
who drove themselves and their
country insane

27:34.528 --> 27:36.704
by their own propaganda.

27:36.704 --> 27:38.944
Propaganda that spread like a virus.

27:38.944 --> 27:42.976
A virus of fear so evil,
those that caught it

27:42.976 --> 27:45.920
stopped seeing human beings as
people at all

27:45.920 --> 27:47.712
but as insects -

27:47.712 --> 27:50.592
insects that needed to be
eradicated,

27:50.592 --> 27:52.384
systematically,

27:52.384 --> 27:54.624
in 100 days,

27:54.624 --> 27:57.696
until it was stopped.

27:57.696 --> 28:01.152
But for millions of people,
millions of Hutus,

28:01.152 --> 28:05.632
the fear they'd already been
infected with - that didn't go away.

28:05.632 --> 28:08.256
Something else took its place.

28:08.256 --> 28:10.112
The fear of retribution.

28:10.112 --> 28:13.888
And no matter how hard
the RPF tried to reassure them,

28:13.888 --> 28:21.440
they still ran out of Rwanda
into Zaire.

28:21.440 --> 28:25.216
I know this because that's where
I saw Patrice Ganimana

28:25.216 --> 28:29.504
for the second time, in early 1997.

28:29.504 --> 28:31.872
In a refugee camp in Zaire.

28:31.872 --> 28:36.420
No longer just a major,
now he was the leader of his group.

28:36.420 --> 28:38.720
Still fanning the hatred,

28:38.720 --> 28:40.960
blowing on the embers,

28:40.960 --> 28:42.944
trying to ignite it all again.

28:42.944 --> 28:45.312
Looking to go back to Rwanda,

28:45.312 --> 28:49.600
to finish what they'd started.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.712
But then they arrived.

28:51.712 --> 28:55.296
A new army.

28:55.296 --> 28:58.752
There'd been ethnic tension in the
region for years.

28:58.752 --> 29:00.224
The government of Zaire

29:00.224 --> 29:04.384
had been waging a campaign
against ethnic Tutsis.

29:04.384 --> 29:09.312
The arrival of the Hutu refugees
exacerbated the tension

29:09.312 --> 29:14.688
until, in 1996,
an ethnic Tutsi army was formed,

29:14.688 --> 29:18.720
with the intent of both
toppling the Zairian government

29:18.720 --> 29:23.840
and ridding the region
of the Hutu refugee camps.

29:23.840 --> 29:28.384
By '97, the RPF
sent its own military leaders

29:28.384 --> 29:30.880
into the ranks of this new Tutsi
army

29:30.880 --> 29:36.832
to help coordinate the dismantling
of these final camps.

29:36.832 --> 29:40.224
And it's true,
in the camps I attended,

29:40.224 --> 29:44.192
Ganimana and his people were there.

29:44.192 --> 29:49.248
But I contend they were using
these refugees as human shields.

29:49.248 --> 29:52.704
Of an estimated 50,000 people,

29:52.704 --> 29:54.944
9,000 were children,

29:54.944 --> 29:57.696
many more were women,

29:57.696 --> 30:01.664
and almost all were catastrophically
ill.

30:01.664 --> 30:04.864
They couldn't have gone anywhere
if they'd wanted.

30:04.864 --> 30:11.840
Then one day in April, all Western
aid workers were ordered to leave.

30:11.840 --> 30:14.592
We were taken to a cordon
about a mile away,

30:14.592 --> 30:16.640
out of sight of the camps.

30:16.640 --> 30:18.304
A few workers,

30:18.304 --> 30:26.820
including a colleague of mine,
Edward Holt, remained until
the very last.

30:26.820 --> 30:30.272
So I cannot say I saw it.

30:30.272 --> 30:33.280
I cannot say I saw anything.

30:33.280 --> 30:36.544
What I can say is that
four days later,

30:36.544 --> 30:40.192
when we were finally allowed to
return to the camp,

30:40.192 --> 30:45.060
it was completely empty -
and I mean completely.

30:45.060 --> 30:49.536
Not a single vestige to indicate
that less than a week before,

30:49.536 --> 30:52.736
some 50,000 people
had been living there.

30:52.736 --> 30:57.024
Women, children, babies.

30:57.024 --> 30:59.904
Many too ill to move.

30:59.904 --> 31:02.592
It was as if they never existed.

31:02.592 --> 31:07.072
And I never saw any of them again,
ever.

31:07.072 --> 31:08.864
Except for one.

31:08.864 --> 31:12.256
Someone my colleague Ed Holt

31:12.256 --> 31:14.752
took with him on his last airlift
out.

31:14.752 --> 31:16.992
A little girl.

31:16.992 --> 31:28.192
A Hutu child.

31:28.192 --> 31:31.584
Are you coming in?

31:31.584 --> 31:43.744
Any reason why I shouldn't?

31:43.744 --> 31:47.456
MICHAEL:Ed flew with you to Kigali,
     where Eve was waiting.

31:47.456 --> 31:50.272
He handed you to her
and went straight back -

31:50.272 --> 31:52.064
the rotors didn't stop.

31:52.064 --> 31:54.816
They didn't even say goodbye.

31:54.816 --> 31:56.352
Eve took you to hospital.

31:56.352 --> 32:00.064
You almost died.

32:00.064 --> 32:02.432
Many times.

32:02.432 --> 32:05.056
I think you would've, without her.

32:05.056 --> 32:06.720
I went to see Alice.

32:06.720 --> 32:09.856
She knew that Eve and I
had been building a case

32:09.856 --> 32:12.032
against Ganimana for the ICTR.

32:12.032 --> 32:14.464
When he was located in that camp,

32:14.464 --> 32:17.280
we expected her to coordinate his
arrest.

32:17.280 --> 32:21.312
But because of her position
in military intelligence,

32:21.312 --> 32:24.960
she already knew
what was really happening out there.

32:24.960 --> 32:29.376
The RPF was a very disciplined
outfit - they still are.

32:29.376 --> 32:32.704
They take a hell of a lot of pride
in that. I know Alice did.

32:32.704 --> 32:34.432
Geneva Convention and all that.

32:34.432 --> 32:39.424
Anyway, when she found out
what was really happening out there,

32:39.424 --> 32:41.984
she thought it bust all that down.

32:41.984 --> 32:44.736
So she put a wiretap
on the military airwaves

32:44.736 --> 32:47.360
to record the chatter between units.

32:47.360 --> 32:49.216
Why?

32:49.216 --> 32:52.740
To prove they knew
what was really going on.

32:52.740 --> 32:54.660
And when your mother heard it,

32:54.660 --> 32:56.832
she wanted to take the recordings
to the ICTR

32:56.832 --> 32:59.072
and use it to prosecute
the new government -

32:59.072 --> 33:03.296
for you, for your family, for Ed,

33:03.296 --> 33:06.048
for justice.

33:06.048 --> 33:10.528
Except everyone knew
it wouldn't be allowed.

33:10.528 --> 33:12.320
It couldn't be.

33:12.320 --> 33:16.224
Not by the US, the UK, the UN.

33:16.224 --> 33:18.592
Not even by me.

33:18.592 --> 33:26.592
What was happening out there,
to you, your family, how many
others...

33:26.592 --> 33:29.216
..as terrible as it was,
on the scale of things,

33:29.216 --> 33:32.672
it couldn't match what had already
happened. There's no possible
equivalence.

33:32.672 --> 33:37.408
And that's what we were there
to prosecute.

33:37.408 --> 33:42.784
The genocide of almost a million
people.

33:42.784 --> 33:44.512
How could we possibly, Kate,

33:44.512 --> 33:46.880
possibly bring an investigation

33:46.880 --> 33:51.360
against the very people
who had just brought it to a close?

33:51.360 --> 33:52.768
We couldn't.

33:52.768 --> 33:55.584
Nobody wanted to listen.

33:55.584 --> 33:57.824
They didn't even want to know.

33:57.824 --> 34:01.088
So we agreed we had to shut it all
down.

34:01.088 --> 34:03.520
There was no other choice.

34:03.520 --> 34:06.464
And to protect you,
we gave you a story

34:06.464 --> 34:09.472
around which we knew
everyone would want to help.

34:09.472 --> 34:11.264
And they did.

34:11.264 --> 34:13.056
It got you out.

34:13.056 --> 34:14.528
It got you here.

34:14.528 --> 34:17.152
(CHANTING:Alice! Alice!Alice!)

34:17.152 --> 34:18.368
Whe...?

34:18.368 --> 34:21.056
Where is it?

34:21.056 --> 34:24.320
This recording, I presume
that's what everyone's looking for.

34:24.320 --> 34:33.856
(CROWD CHANTING:Alice! Alice!
Alice!)

34:33.856 --> 34:42.496
CHEERING

34:42.496 --> 34:45.952
Your mother must've kept it
at Mark Viner's and taken it out

34:45.952 --> 34:48.576
right before she went to The Hague.

34:48.576 --> 34:53.312
And then afterwards, I...
You?

34:53.312 --> 34:55.744
You had it all along.

34:55.744 --> 35:01.888
..gave it to Alice, who has it now.

35:01.888 --> 35:04.512
Why?

35:04.512 --> 35:07.136
Because we also made a promise,
Kate,

35:07.136 --> 35:13.216
Eve, Eunice, Alice and I...

35:13.216 --> 35:18.272
..that no matter how long we had to
wait, one day we'd come back to it.

35:18.272 --> 35:20.128
Reopen the case.

35:20.128 --> 35:21.920
Tell the truth...

35:21.920 --> 35:24.096
..to the world,

35:24.096 --> 35:25.824
to you.

35:25.824 --> 35:27.488
And...

35:27.488 --> 35:30.688
..when Nyamoya was arrested,

35:30.688 --> 35:32.864
we thought the time had come.

35:32.864 --> 35:37.664
And then after Alice
was released in France...

35:37.664 --> 35:41.248
But we were wrong.

35:41.248 --> 35:44.512
It's today, Kate.

35:44.512 --> 35:45.540
ALICE:It...

35:45.540 --> 35:47.968
..is now!

35:47.968 --> 35:55.264
Because if we do not publicly
recognise each and every fragment of
           our past...

35:55.264 --> 35:59.168
..our story will never be complete.

35:59.168 --> 36:01.536
If we are to be truly united,

36:01.536 --> 36:04.608
truly reconciled as a country,
as a city,

36:04.608 --> 36:07.168
in our villages, our streets,

36:07.168 --> 36:11.904
to our neighbours, to ourselves...

36:11.904 --> 36:17.600
..our story has to be complete.

36:17.600 --> 36:22.464
ALICE:During my trial in France,
I met a brilliant young advocate.

36:22.464 --> 36:26.752
Her name is Kate Ashby.

36:26.752 --> 36:28.740
This is not her birth name.

36:28.740 --> 36:31.232
She was born here.

36:31.232 --> 36:35.968
And recently, having helped release
me from an entirely fabricated
prosecution,

36:35.968 --> 36:40.384
she has returned here to help us
in the extradition

36:40.384 --> 36:45.376
of yet another evil participant
in the genocide.

36:45.376 --> 36:46.980
To be sent here.

36:46.980 --> 36:49.344
To face justice here.

36:49.344 --> 36:54.016
Where it matters most.

36:54.016 --> 36:55.744
Here.

36:55.744 --> 37:01.184
And all that young woman wants
to see revealed is the truth.

37:01.184 --> 37:02.976
For us.

37:02.976 --> 37:06.496
So how can it be that,

37:06.496 --> 37:10.016
even though she does this,

37:10.016 --> 37:16.416
we cannot allow her
to know the truth about herself?

37:16.416 --> 37:20.192
But with the penal code
and constitution of our country

37:20.192 --> 37:22.176
as it now stands,

37:22.176 --> 37:24.420
I cannot tell you the truth

37:24.420 --> 37:26.656
without running the risk of arrest.

37:26.656 --> 37:28.704
Here. Now.

37:28.704 --> 37:31.008
Where it matters most.

37:31.008 --> 37:33.312
I cannot.

37:33.312 --> 37:38.048
Because to do so would be
to stand accused of sectarianism,

37:38.048 --> 37:42.016
divisionism,
even inciting insurrection.

37:42.016 --> 37:44.832
So I'm not going to tell you.

37:44.832 --> 37:50.464
I am going to let others do it for
me.

37:50.464 --> 37:55.904
TAKES A SHAKY BREATH

37:55.904 --> 38:03.008
In here is a recording
made in April 1997...

38:03.008 --> 38:08.896
..in Zaire, outside
a Rwandan Hutu refugee camp,

38:08.896 --> 38:11.136
near Kisangani,

38:11.136 --> 38:15.232
between an unnamed Congolese officer

38:15.232 --> 38:21.440
and his superior, a Commander Simon.

38:21.440 --> 38:24.000
I know exactly who this man is.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.780
I fought alongside him
during the liberation.

38:27.780 --> 38:29.568
He was a Rwandan.

38:29.568 --> 38:33.088
He was a national hero.

38:33.088 --> 38:34.500
And his name

38:34.500 --> 38:38.592
was Simon Nyamoya.

38:38.592 --> 38:40.576
In this recording,

38:40.576 --> 38:45.696
when Simon instructs the officer not
to let any Westerners back into the
camp

38:45.696 --> 38:50.624
until it has been completely
dismantled...

38:50.624 --> 38:53.056
(ALICE CONTINUES)Please.

38:53.056 --> 38:56.512
I ask you.

38:56.512 --> 39:00.096
Please.

39:00.096 --> 39:04.064
Consider exactly what the word

39:04.064 --> 39:06.560
"dismantled" meant

39:06.560 --> 39:14.304
to 50,000 cholera-stricken
refugees...

39:14.304 --> 39:32.608
..9,000 of whom...were just
children.

39:32.608 --> 39:46.624
PRESSES PLAY

39:46.624 --> 39:49.952
SILENCE

39:49.952 --> 40:44.100
PRESSES PLAY AGAIN

40:44.100 --> 41:29.024
AIR BUBBLES

41:29.024 --> 41:38.820
AIR BUBBLES

41:38.820 --> 41:47.904
SPLASHING

41:47.904 --> 41:56.288
Oh!Guhh...

41:56.288 --> 42:03.456
GRAVEL CRUNCHES

42:03.456 --> 42:09.408
Are you all right?

42:09.408 --> 42:11.072
That's a...

42:11.072 --> 42:13.696
That's a...

42:13.696 --> 42:18.944
That's a big story.
Oh, yes, it is.

42:18.944 --> 42:20.992
Must have been hard to hold on to.

42:20.992 --> 42:25.664
Oh, yes, it was.

42:25.664 --> 42:29.760
I wish you'd just told it to me.

42:29.760 --> 42:36.608
I did.

42:36.608 --> 42:39.040
No.

42:39.040 --> 42:52.672
You didn't.

42:52.672 --> 42:56.192
Yeah, I have a hard stop today,
folks, so, er,

42:56.192 --> 42:58.304
apologies, but I have to
wrap this up shortly.

42:58.304 --> 43:00.992
So, er...yeah, Matt.

43:00.992 --> 43:05.344
MATT:Comment on the arrest of Alice
Munezero on her arrival in Rwanda.

43:05.344 --> 43:07.904
Obviously we're very concerned.

43:07.904 --> 43:17.056
TRANSLATED FROM FRENCH

43:17.056 --> 43:19.232
We believe she's under house arrest

43:19.232 --> 43:22.560
pending a specific charge
of inciting insurrection.

43:22.560 --> 43:26.016
But I think it's vital to remember
the cataclysmic events

43:26.016 --> 43:29.280
suffered by that country
in the not-too-distant past...

43:29.280 --> 43:31.904
..and the remarkable progress it's
made

43:31.904 --> 43:34.720
over the almost quarter of a century
             since.

43:34.720 --> 43:38.752
It is a, er, beacon of stability
not only within its borders,

43:38.752 --> 43:40.672
economically and socially,

43:40.672 --> 43:44.064
but in a region that is otherwise
prone to, er,

43:44.064 --> 43:45.280
severe convulsions.

43:45.280 --> 43:49.376
But this comes at too great a cost!

43:49.376 --> 43:54.368
A cost it seems the international
community is all too willing to
ignore.

43:54.368 --> 43:58.592
But it is very clear to us
that the Rwandan government

43:58.592 --> 44:01.344
is using its own poorly defined laws

44:01.344 --> 44:05.056
not to protect its nation from
divisionism and hate crime

44:05.056 --> 44:11.584
but to ensure that no-one, not even
one of their very own heroes,

44:11.584 --> 44:14.016
can ever call them to account.

44:14.016 --> 44:16.768
However, given her inability at this
              point

44:16.768 --> 44:20.416
to substantiate on the specific
nature of her allegations,

44:20.416 --> 44:24.704
we are simply unable to gauge
the strength or weakness of her case

44:24.704 --> 44:30.272
and therefore the justification or
not of any action taken against her.

44:30.272 --> 44:34.240
REPORTER:But could Alice Munezero's
  arrest have a negative impact

44:34.240 --> 44:37.504
on the extradition proceedings
against Patrice Ganimana?

44:37.504 --> 44:41.152
We're saying we need to
keep a very close eye on things.

44:41.152 --> 44:43.584
A very close eye.

44:43.584 --> 44:46.656
LIFT BELL DINGS

44:46.656 --> 44:50.112
Spare a minute?

44:50.112 --> 44:52.544
DAVID:Just so as we're clear,

44:52.544 --> 44:54.720
we went to the US in '96.

44:54.720 --> 44:58.112
And the UN, and the UK.

44:58.112 --> 45:00.420
And we told them
that if they weren't going to

45:00.420 --> 45:02.528
do something about those camps,
we would.

45:02.528 --> 45:04.704
And what did they do, your people?

45:04.704 --> 45:06.496
Nothing. So we had to,

45:06.496 --> 45:10.784
like they knew we would.

45:10.784 --> 45:12.640
Is that a confession, David?

45:12.640 --> 45:15.264
For the blind eyes of
the international community,

45:15.264 --> 45:18.080
that is a fact. And it's no secret.

45:18.080 --> 45:20.832
So am I going to be allowed
to represent her?

45:20.832 --> 45:24.032
You don't have to ask my permission,
            Michael.

45:24.032 --> 45:28.064
It's enshrined within our law -
she can choose whoever she wants.

45:28.064 --> 45:31.200
She's chosen me.
Congratulations.

45:31.200 --> 45:33.952
Immune from prosecution
for representing her views?

45:33.952 --> 45:36.900
Also enshrined in law.

45:36.900 --> 45:38.820
Wasn't always.

45:38.820 --> 45:47.968
Is now.

45:47.968 --> 45:51.232
Runihura.

45:51.232 --> 45:56.096
My country is surrounded by tinder
so dry even a hot fart would set it
off,

45:56.096 --> 46:00.384
and all you and your playboy friends
  want to do is strike a match.

46:00.384 --> 46:02.820
She's not trying to divide your
country.

46:02.820 --> 46:05.120
We are all one nation now,

46:05.120 --> 46:08.704
and anyone who tries to pull us
apart is dividing our country.

46:08.704 --> 46:11.520
She's trying to unify it, and you
know it.

46:11.520 --> 46:13.696
How kind of you to inform me
of my thoughts.

46:13.696 --> 46:20.480
Please.

46:20.480 --> 46:22.528
The French were right.

46:22.528 --> 46:24.768
You're only using those laws

46:24.768 --> 46:26.944
to make sure that no-one can ever
hold you to account.

46:26.944 --> 46:28.608
Even her.

46:28.608 --> 46:34.496
The way you see it, any criticism of
 your government is divisionist.

46:34.496 --> 46:37.952
This isn't about reconciliation,
it's about power.

46:37.952 --> 46:39.744
And your need to keep it.

46:39.744 --> 46:43.712
And did you ever consider that
maybe my country wants us to?

46:43.712 --> 46:47.424
They don't care that some Tutsi girl

46:47.424 --> 46:50.112
who turned out to be a Hutu
has tried to help us out.

46:50.112 --> 46:53.056
They don't want to look back at any
of it.

46:53.056 --> 46:57.152
We are all Rwandans now
and we just look forward.

46:57.152 --> 47:00.032
1.5 million people lifted out of
poverty,

47:00.032 --> 47:01.504
7% growth per annum,

47:01.504 --> 47:05.664
3% unemployment,
health, education, communication.

47:05.664 --> 47:08.224
What happens when all those
economic figures head south?

47:08.224 --> 47:09.568
They're going to care then.

47:09.568 --> 47:11.744
Not about some Western-backed egoist

47:11.744 --> 47:14.432
who is just using the whole issue
as an excuse.

47:14.432 --> 47:15.780
For what?

47:15.780 --> 47:20.384
To destroy what she knows
she can never have.

47:20.384 --> 47:21.472
Which is?

47:21.472 --> 47:25.504
Love, Michael.

47:25.504 --> 47:26.848
Love!

47:26.848 --> 47:32.096
(LAUGHS)What?

47:32.096 --> 47:33.632
What?

47:33.632 --> 47:36.064
You think this is all about justice?

47:36.064 --> 47:39.776
It's so much more basic than that.

47:39.776 --> 47:42.976
May I tell you a story?
Is that really a question?

47:42.976 --> 47:45.024
You are right.

47:45.024 --> 47:48.420
So, there was this little bird,

47:48.420 --> 47:52.260
a drongo chick, a forest bird.

47:52.260 --> 47:55.200
And one day,
suddenly, into her nest,

47:55.200 --> 47:59.232
a new chick arrived - a cuckoo.

47:59.232 --> 48:04.480
You understand what happens
to the drongo.

48:04.480 --> 48:07.296
But she will not die.

48:07.296 --> 48:10.560
The hunger for revenge
will keep her strong.

48:10.560 --> 48:13.248
And she will search the forest floor
          far and wide

48:13.248 --> 48:15.360
until she finds what it is
she's looking for.

48:15.360 --> 48:20.096
A caterpillar. The most poisonous
caterpillar in all the world.

48:20.096 --> 48:23.104
And then, having placed it tenderly
in her beak,

48:23.104 --> 48:27.456
she will claw her way back up that
tree, back into that nest,

48:27.456 --> 48:29.504
where finally, triumphantly,

48:29.504 --> 48:32.580
she will feed this deadly grub
to her foundling sister

48:32.580 --> 48:39.424
so that then, once more, it will be
our little drongo who is loved as
she was.

48:39.424 --> 48:42.496
As she deserves to be again.

48:42.496 --> 48:44.672
Now...

48:44.672 --> 48:47.680
..who do you suppose is who
in my little story?

48:47.680 --> 48:50.820
I think I can guess.

48:50.820 --> 48:53.440
Yes.

48:53.440 --> 48:55.040
There is no tape, Michael.

48:55.040 --> 48:56.192
I saw it.

48:56.192 --> 48:58.112
But did you listen to it?

48:58.112 --> 48:59.712
It's in Kinyarwanda.

48:59.712 --> 49:02.340
You speak Kinyarwanda?

49:02.340 --> 49:04.832
Even if you could,
how do you know it wasn't a fake?

49:04.832 --> 49:07.648
Because I trust the person
who recorded it.

49:07.648 --> 49:11.296
You trust the little drongo?

49:11.296 --> 49:12.768
We also have a witness.

49:12.768 --> 49:16.928
Do you? Or is that just something
else you want to believe?

49:16.928 --> 49:18.400
No.

49:18.400 --> 49:20.064
Why not?

49:20.064 --> 49:21.664
Because I'd know it.

49:21.664 --> 49:25.568
Because you would sense it?

49:25.568 --> 49:31.200
Michael Ennis, the man who can
smell the truth like a pig finds
truffles.

49:31.200 --> 49:35.936
And yet there was something else
in my story, something you missed.

49:35.936 --> 49:38.112
Yeah?Mmm.

49:38.112 --> 49:41.440
You.

49:41.440 --> 49:43.424
I'm not in your story.

49:43.424 --> 49:46.048
But you were.

49:46.048 --> 49:48.800
You are the little caterpillar,
Michael.

49:48.800 --> 49:53.856
The most poisonous caterpillar
in all the world.

49:53.856 --> 49:56.100
Yeah? Well, you better watch out.

49:56.100 --> 49:58.272
Why?

49:58.272 --> 50:01.088
You are the one who ends up getting
eaten.

50:01.088 --> 50:11.904
LAUGHING

50:11.904 --> 50:14.464
MICHAEL:Eunice.
You're not going to believe this.

50:14.464 --> 50:16.448
I don't have cancer!

50:16.448 --> 50:18.240
That's great, Eunice!

50:18.240 --> 50:21.376
Big fucker, but they just whipped it
      out laparoscopically.

50:21.376 --> 50:22.592
Hot dog!

50:22.592 --> 50:25.664
Kinda like sucking Donald Trump's
head out of a keyhole.

50:25.664 --> 50:26.944
LAUGHTER

50:26.944 --> 50:28.224
So, where are we?

50:28.224 --> 50:31.552
Well, effectively,
they're both under house arrest

50:31.552 --> 50:36.032
and I'm just waiting for my
application to the Rwandan Bar
Association.

50:36.032 --> 50:37.440
And Kate?

50:37.440 --> 50:39.040
Uh-huh.
But she knows?

50:39.040 --> 50:40.192
Yeah.

50:40.192 --> 50:42.944
All right. We're right where we
should be.

50:42.944 --> 50:44.224
Not quite.

50:44.224 --> 50:46.976
How so?

50:46.976 --> 50:48.384
Are you sitting down?

50:48.384 --> 50:50.112
I'm bouncing off the walls here,
baby.

50:50.112 --> 50:56.896
Sit down.

50:56.896 --> 50:58.624
We should have made more copies.

50:58.624 --> 51:00.864
We agreed not to.

51:00.864 --> 51:04.832
No, we agreed to Alice telling us
not to.

51:04.832 --> 51:06.112
You think David had a point?

51:06.112 --> 51:08.100
No. It doesn't matter.

51:08.100 --> 51:09.440
We've still got me.

51:09.440 --> 51:12.960
Uh...now things are different.

51:12.960 --> 51:15.200
How?

51:15.200 --> 51:19.296
Well, you didn't actually
hear the conversation.

51:19.296 --> 51:21.984
But I did.

51:21.984 --> 51:24.160
What?I did hear it.

51:24.160 --> 51:27.168
It was translated for me
right then and there.

51:27.168 --> 51:31.584
Obviously because we were pushing
to get back in the camp.

51:31.584 --> 51:34.912
Did you, Eunice?

51:34.912 --> 51:37.472
Did you really?

51:37.472 --> 51:39.840
Sure I did.

51:39.840 --> 51:42.400
And there's no way they can blow
that out of court.

51:42.400 --> 51:43.872
EXHALES

51:43.872 --> 51:45.728
That's the other thing.

51:45.728 --> 51:47.840
What?
Kate was right.

51:47.840 --> 51:50.592
There's a problem with the defence
funding over there.

51:50.592 --> 51:53.472
Oh, my God, Mikey,
you're going pro bono on this.

51:53.472 --> 51:56.032
No, for the investigative team.

51:56.032 --> 52:00.192
It seems there's just about enough
for gas to get us to the border

52:00.192 --> 52:02.752
and then we're on our own.
Well, that's not such a problem.

52:02.752 --> 52:04.160
And why is that?

52:04.160 --> 52:06.912
I represent the State Department,
Michael.

52:06.912 --> 52:10.112
We've got a pretty big tool box
at our disposal, believe me.

52:10.112 --> 52:13.380
Well, you're gonna need a team
in the DRC ASAP.

52:13.380 --> 52:14.912
We need those grave sites, Eunice.

52:14.912 --> 52:16.320
And we're gonna get it.

52:16.320 --> 52:30.912
I got a new lease on life, baby,
and I'm gonna use it!

52:30.912 --> 52:33.984
Hey, Eunice.

52:33.984 --> 52:36.224
Can I speak with him?

52:36.224 --> 52:38.144
Double bogey on the ninth.

52:38.144 --> 52:41.984
It's pretty ugly.
I need to speak to him.

52:41.984 --> 52:45.632
You really think?

52:45.632 --> 52:47.296
You can't stand me down.

52:47.296 --> 52:50.048
Extended leave of absence, come on.

52:50.048 --> 52:52.544
At least this way you get to keep
your health insurance.

52:52.544 --> 52:54.464
But not my job.
Er, no.

52:54.464 --> 52:57.728
No, that's going to someone else
now.

52:57.728 --> 53:00.160
Because I did my civic duty?
You think maybe

53:00.160 --> 53:02.336
it's because of your diet?
What?

53:02.336 --> 53:04.064
You got hypoxia or something?

53:04.064 --> 53:07.456
Maybe you should have spent a little
bit more time with your feet in the
air.

53:07.456 --> 53:09.376
I had to give evidence.

53:09.376 --> 53:11.040
You should have cleared it with us
first.

53:11.040 --> 53:13.472
There was no time.
Oh, you should have made some.

53:13.472 --> 53:15.136
I appeared as a private citizen.

53:15.136 --> 53:17.888
Not when you are in public office,
you don't.

53:17.888 --> 53:22.112
Ever.

53:22.112 --> 53:24.608
You gotta let that team go
into the DRC.

53:24.608 --> 53:27.424
Yeah, no, actually,
that was the final straw.

53:27.424 --> 53:32.352
Now, we don't get to use the
department as our own private army.

53:32.352 --> 53:37.600
Jesus, Eunice,
you're not Pablo fucking Escobar!

53:37.600 --> 53:40.736
It was...

53:40.736 --> 53:43.620
It was a bad thing.

53:43.620 --> 53:45.152
I know.

53:45.152 --> 53:46.176
I saw it.

53:46.176 --> 53:48.416
Funny you never thought
to mention it before.

53:48.416 --> 53:50.720
No-one did. No-one could.

53:50.720 --> 53:52.192
Isn't that the point?

53:52.192 --> 53:53.600
So why now?

53:53.600 --> 53:55.712
I was called to give evidence.
I gave it.

53:55.712 --> 53:58.528
But weirdly, at exactly the same
time

53:58.528 --> 54:01.984
as this Alice Munezero
says the same thing.

54:01.984 --> 54:03.780
You tip her off, Eunice?

54:03.780 --> 54:08.896
Or have you always been working
together?

54:08.896 --> 54:10.304
Yeah.

54:10.304 --> 54:12.992
Yeah, if I were you,
I'd take the Fifth on that as well.

54:12.992 --> 54:14.784
She deserves our help.

54:14.784 --> 54:17.472
Regime change?
How's that working out for us?

54:17.472 --> 54:19.072
That's not what she wants.

54:19.072 --> 54:22.080
Inciting insurrection,
divisionism, sectarianism.

54:22.080 --> 54:27.136
It doesn't feel like she's looking
for an extension on Sunday trading.

54:27.136 --> 54:31.040
And why has she been charged, Scott?
              Hmm?

54:31.040 --> 54:34.688
At all? Just because she spoke the
truth?

54:34.688 --> 54:43.392
And this from a government that gets
almost 30% of its expenditure from
us?

54:43.392 --> 54:47.488
Well, what does she want?

54:47.488 --> 54:49.728
The removal of two articles
from the penal code

54:49.728 --> 54:53.700
and the tightening of the
Constitution on Hate Crime, so her
government

54:53.700 --> 54:55.360
can no longer use them as tools for

54:55.360 --> 55:00.608
the reduction of political space
and accountability.

55:00.608 --> 55:02.340
Snappy slogan.

55:02.340 --> 55:06.944
It's just law, Scott,
just a change in the law.

55:06.944 --> 55:09.184
That's it, that's all she wants.

55:09.184 --> 55:12.192
Everything else stays the same.
Mundanzi, the lot.

55:12.192 --> 55:18.144
Jesus, Eunice,
what the fuck were you thinking?

55:18.144 --> 55:22.624
Well, I hope he's birdied the tenth.

55:22.624 --> 55:24.352
I'll find those graves.

55:24.352 --> 55:26.656
Sure you will.

55:26.656 --> 55:46.048
You'll need a shovel.

55:46.048 --> 55:48.608
What are we gonna do about Eunice
Clayton and her mass graves?

55:48.608 --> 55:51.296
Bit "Mighty Whitey", wouldn't you
say?

55:51.296 --> 55:53.728
Except she's black.
Except she's not African.

55:53.728 --> 55:56.544
We've got a president who makes up
names for African countries.

55:56.544 --> 55:59.104
Jane.

55:59.104 --> 56:03.072
How many people, you think,
could pick out the DRC on a map?

56:03.072 --> 56:06.336
Or Rwanda? Precisely?

56:06.336 --> 56:07.936
It doesn't mean we shouldn't find
out.

56:07.936 --> 56:09.536
It does if no-one cares.

56:09.536 --> 56:11.648
We peddle stuff no-one cares about,

56:11.648 --> 56:14.208
when we try and peddle
stuff they should, no-one will.

56:14.208 --> 56:16.640
How many problems
we got out there already?

56:16.640 --> 56:21.120
Syria, Korea, Israel,
Ukraine, Yemen.

56:21.120 --> 56:23.168
How many we got sitting in our own
den?

56:23.168 --> 56:25.600
Crime, inequality, political
corruption?

56:25.600 --> 56:28.672
Stuff our people really do
need to know about right now.

56:28.672 --> 56:31.296
We're talking about mass graves.
We certainly would be,

56:31.296 --> 56:34.048
if she had found them in Minnesota.

56:34.048 --> 56:36.096
No.

56:36.096 --> 56:38.784
Krupke, we got troubles of our own.

56:38.784 --> 57:02.340
That one they're going to have
to fix for themselves.
