Yes, this is Russ.

Yes.

Y-you... you... you think

00:52.715 --> 00:54.514
Yeah, uh, I-I would have to fly.

00:56.585 --> 00:58.552
Yeah.

01:01.357 --> 01:02.989
Yeah.

01:06.095 --> 01:09.563
Okay, yeah, I'll let you know.

01:19.108 --> 01:20.607
<i> Good morning.</i>

01:20.642 --> 01:22.609
<i>I'm meteorologist Stu Haines

01:29.184 --> 01:32.886
<i> You can feel the

01:36.925 --> 01:39.393
<i>Welcome to Modesto Airport.</i>

01:39.428 --> 01:41.395
<i>Please do not leave baggage unattended</i>

01:41.430 --> 01:46.233
<i>for the safety of yourself

01:46.268 --> 01:50.203
Mr. Skokie. Chuck Palmer, Modesto P.D.

01:53.842 --> 01:56.143
It's the last room over here.

02:01.950 --> 02:03.183
Mr. Skokie,

02:03.218 --> 02:05.185
someone inside the room is
going to pull the blind back.

02:05.220 --> 02:07.521
You're going to see a
table with a body on it.

02:07.556 --> 02:10.190
I need you to tell me if the
body you see is your son.

02:10.225 --> 02:12.526
Let me know when you're ready.

02:14.430 --> 02:16.062
Mr. Skokie.

02:16.098 --> 02:17.397
Mm.

02:20.235 --> 02:21.868
Go ahead.

02:33.148 --> 02:35.949
That's Matt. That's him.

02:38.153 --> 02:40.120
Why don't we, uh, go sit down somewhere...

02:40.155 --> 02:42.956
Can I, um...

02:42.991 --> 02:45.826
Is there
a bathroom I could use?

02:58.574 --> 03:03.043
We took a call from one
of your son's neighbors.

03:03.078 --> 03:04.711
Officers responded to your son's home,

03:04.746 --> 03:07.380
where they found two victims.

03:07.416 --> 03:10.884
Gwen? Is Gwen dead?

03:10.919 --> 03:14.554
Gwen's at the hospital.
She's in critical condition.

03:14.590 --> 03:18.458
I have to be honest, Mr. Skokie.
It doesn't look very hopeful.

03:18.494 --> 03:20.293
We're still investigating what happened,

03:20.329 --> 03:21.962
but we haven't been able to locate a wallet,

03:21.997 --> 03:24.464
credit cards, I.D. for
your son at the scene.

03:24.500 --> 03:26.299
It's possible the motivation was robbery,

03:26.335 --> 03:29.636
but we're not ruling anything out.

03:29.671 --> 03:31.805
Mr. Skokie, I can't go into specifics,

03:31.840 --> 03:34.140
but your son's wife...

03:34.176 --> 03:36.510
There are indications she
was sexually assaulted.

03:36.545 --> 03:38.211
Oh, God.

03:38.247 --> 03:40.714
Now, we
have a few leads that we're following.

03:40.749 --> 03:42.716
- Oh, God.
- We have a very strong description

03:42.751 --> 03:44.551
of a vehicle of interest
that was in the vicinity

03:44.586 --> 03:45.886
during the shooting.

03:45.921 --> 03:48.054
The driver we're looking for
is a young hispanic male.

03:48.090 --> 03:49.222
Is Gwen all right?

03:49.258 --> 03:50.724
Is she gonna... Is she gonna be all right?

03:50.759 --> 03:51.992
She's in critical condition, Mr. Skokie.

03:52.027 --> 03:53.260
I'd like to... I think I
would like to see her...

03:53.295 --> 03:55.262
- I honestly don't know right now.
- And go where she is.

03:55.297 --> 03:57.097
We want to catch the person who did this,

03:57.132 --> 03:59.432
and if there's anything
you can do to help us...

03:59.468 --> 04:02.936
Did your son ever mention anyone
that he had any problems with,

04:02.971 --> 04:03.970
anyone who might...

04:04.006 --> 04:06.473
No. Matt, he... I-I don't... h-he's not...

04:06.508 --> 04:09.476
When was the last time that
you talked to him, Mr. Skokie?

04:09.511 --> 04:11.478
Sunday.

04:11.513 --> 04:14.314
W-we talked every...

04:19.154 --> 04:21.788
That's when it happened, isn't it?

04:34.336 --> 04:37.637
Have you called his mother yet?

04:37.673 --> 04:40.473
No, sir. We had your number.

04:40.509 --> 04:43.810
We contacted you for a positive I.D.

04:43.845 --> 04:46.146
Would you like to call his mother?

04:49.618 --> 04:53.753
Would you like to call her, Mr. Skokie?

04:55.791 --> 04:57.257
- This it for you?
- That's it.

05:02.431 --> 05:05.599
Yeah, these are sick, man.
Trying to get me a pair.

05:05.634 --> 05:07.767
Yeah.

05:07.803 --> 05:11.071
It's gonna be $235.35.

05:21.183 --> 05:23.483
All right, Mr. Skokie. You enjoy those.

05:51.013 --> 05:53.713

05:53.749 --> 05:55.615
Hey, um, see you
at school, all right?

05:59.888 --> 06:01.655
Why do you have to be so rude?

06:01.690 --> 06:02.822
Jenny, you know you're not supposed to have

06:02.858 --> 06:03.857
anyone over during the week.

06:03.892 --> 06:05.458
- We were doing homework.
- Homework?

06:05.494 --> 06:06.893
- Yes.
- Really? No books?

06:06.928 --> 06:08.194
- We finished.
- Oh, you finished.

- You got boys coming over.
- It's not a mess! I was doing my nails!

06:13.335 --> 06:15.902
Jenny, if you can't follow the rules,

06:15.937 --> 06:17.037
then I guess you don't get to go

How was your day?

06:35.524 --> 06:36.489
Good.

06:42.030 --> 06:44.664
So, the, uh... the starter came in.

06:44.700 --> 06:47.333
Come by the garage
tomorrow. We'll put it in.

06:47.369 --> 06:49.002
Okay.

06:52.808 --> 06:54.941
So, you know this boy from school?

06:56.478 --> 06:58.778
Mm, not really.

06:58.814 --> 07:02.115
Well, does he get in trouble a lot?

07:02.150 --> 07:04.117
I don't know him.

07:06.021 --> 07:09.155
What were they doing?

07:09.191 --> 07:11.825
Homework. And then you came in.

07:11.860 --> 07:13.827
That's it.

07:17.899 --> 07:20.700
I'm gonna watch TV.

07:38.787 --> 07:41.087
I couldn't hardly recognize him.

07:41.123 --> 07:43.590
The detective said that the... t-the gun

07:43.625 --> 07:44.958
must have been right in
the front of his face.

07:44.993 --> 07:47.460
Well, what are the police doing?

07:47.496 --> 07:50.797
Well, they... they... they
have a description of a car.

07:50.832 --> 07:52.766
A... when was Matt killed, Sunday?

07:52.801 --> 07:55.902
It's Tuesday. All they have
is a description of a car?

07:55.937 --> 07:57.237
And, uh, they said that,
uh, they think it might be

07:57.272 --> 07:59.072
an hispanic kid.

07:59.107 --> 08:00.073
Some illegal?

08:00.108 --> 08:03.743
I... just "hispanic."

08:03.779 --> 08:05.411
Why did they call you?

08:05.447 --> 08:07.580
And, uh... and they said that they...

08:07.616 --> 08:11.417
They think that maybe G-Gwen was raped.

08:11.453 --> 08:13.920
I don't understand why they called you.

08:13.955 --> 08:15.155
I'm his father.

08:15.190 --> 08:17.657
No, I-I don't understand
why they called you <i> first.</i>

08:17.692 --> 08:18.925
You know, they just, uh...

08:18.960 --> 08:21.194
T-they found my number, and they called me.

08:21.229 --> 08:22.428
What about Mark?

08:22.464 --> 08:25.265
Yeah, I wanted to, uh,
you know, talk to you first.

Oh. You haven't called
Mark yet? Oh, my God, Russ.

08:27.302 --> 08:28.601

take seeing her like that.

12:26.169 --> 12:30.071
But I just prayed, "God..."

12:30.106 --> 12:31.973
Hi, sweetheart.

12:32.008 --> 12:33.474
"...give me strength to
walk into that room."

12:33.509 --> 12:34.475
It's mommy and daddy.

12:34.510 --> 12:36.277
"That's your baby girl..."

12:36.312 --> 12:38.312
We need to discuss your daughter
having been sexually assaulted.

12:38.348 --> 12:40.314
"...And she needs you."

12:43.186 --> 12:47.321
Her hand was so warm.

12:47.357 --> 12:48.656
There's still life in her.

12:48.691 --> 12:49.991
She's gonna survive. She's
gonna get through this.

12:50.026 --> 12:52.693
I know there's still life in her.

12:55.131 --> 12:59.934
There is a reporter who would
like to do a story on us.

12:59.969 --> 13:02.269
I think it's very important
for people to know

13:02.305 --> 13:05.239
who our children were and
what happened to them.

13:05.274 --> 13:06.907
And we have to keep what happened present.

13:06.943 --> 13:09.143
That's just... that's... that's a reality.

13:09.178 --> 13:13.347
If we don't keep talking about it,

13:13.383 --> 13:16.884
in a week o-or two, people
will have moved on.

13:21.491 --> 13:24.125
That's not something we're comfortable with.

13:24.160 --> 13:27.294
All you have to do is talk about her.

13:29.665 --> 13:31.298
Eve...

13:31.334 --> 13:33.467
Just say what you said
about holding her hand.

13:33.503 --> 13:34.668
I see no reason

13:34.704 --> 13:38.339
to talk to people about our
daughter being violated.

13:38.374 --> 13:40.975
None.

13:41.010 --> 13:44.478
I'm trying to help.

13:46.149 --> 13:48.115
Roll me up.

13:48.151 --> 13:50.785
Turn it off. Turn it off.

13:52.488 --> 13:54.622
All right, go ahead and close it up.

13:56.659 --> 13:58.793
Tomorrow, I need you to take this out

13:58.828 --> 14:00.127
and blow out the soot, okay?

14:00.163 --> 14:02.963
Okay.

14:02.999 --> 14:05.633
You should let Jenny go to
the party this weekend.

14:05.668 --> 14:07.968
If she wants to go to parties,
she need to follow the rules.

14:08.004 --> 14:10.304
Yeah, but you always freak
out about everything.

14:10.339 --> 14:11.806
I freak out?

14:11.841 --> 14:13.474
<i>Mijo,</i> I walked through the door,

14:13.509 --> 14:15.476
and she's sitting on the sofa with some boy.

14:15.511 --> 14:18.979
And don't tell me they're doing homework.

14:19.015 --> 14:20.648
You know, I know you don't believe this...

14:20.683 --> 14:24.151
I know you don't... but I
used to be a teenager, too.

14:24.187 --> 14:25.319
I know how you think.

14:27.857 --> 14:30.658
You know, <i>mijo,</i> one day...

14:30.693 --> 14:32.993
One day, you're gonna have
a little girl of your own.

14:33.029 --> 14:34.995
And trust me... You're
gonna be the same way.

14:35.031 --> 14:37.665
No, 'cause when I have my kids,

14:37.700 --> 14:40.367
I'm not gonna freak out
about everything all the time.

14:40.403 --> 14:43.704
- Miguel.
- Hey. What's up, man?

14:45.241 --> 14:48.709
Hey, tell your boss the
next time he sends me a car

14:48.744 --> 14:50.111
not to send it with chunts.

14:50.146 --> 14:52.413
I don't want gang tattoos around here.

14:52.448 --> 14:53.747
You kidding me, man? Those aren't gang tats.

14:53.783 --> 14:55.749
I don't want that around my business.

14:55.785 --> 14:57.351
You want to know what?

14:57.386 --> 14:59.854
You know that?

14:59.889 --> 15:01.689
Just tell him.

15:03.259 --> 15:06.060

17:00.876 --> 17:02.676
I'm... I'm not gonna remember him like that.

17:02.712 --> 17:04.678
Remember him how you have to.

17:04.714 --> 17:06.680
I'm not...

17:06.715 --> 17:09.349
I'm not gonna be one of those...

17:09.385 --> 17:12.353
"Sit and look through scrapbooks crying."

17:12.387 --> 17:15.021
Now is when Matt needs me,

17:15.057 --> 17:16.857
and I have always been there for you two

17:16.892 --> 17:18.025
when you needed me.

17:18.060 --> 17:19.526
How's dad taking it?

17:19.561 --> 17:21.862
And the police are doing nothing.

17:21.896 --> 17:23.530
What do you mean, nothing?

17:23.566 --> 17:25.866
Oh, Russ said they're...

17:25.901 --> 17:28.702
looking for some Mexican.

17:30.239 --> 17:32.873
I just, uh... I really need you here.

17:32.908 --> 17:35.042
I need you to get here, Mark.

17:35.077 --> 17:36.710
I'll fly back as soon as I can.

17:36.746 --> 17:38.712
I need somebody else here.

17:38.748 --> 17:40.714
Okay, mom. I love you.

17:40.750 --> 17:44.418
Oh, honey, I love you, too.

18:14.772 --> 18:16.405
This your car?

18:16.440 --> 18:17.739
It's my dad... Well, his garage...

18:17.775 --> 18:19.574
Can I get your license and registration?

18:19.610 --> 18:21.243
I don't have registration,

18:21.278 --> 18:22.577
but my dad told me to take this for...

18:22.613 --> 18:25.414
- Is this your current address?
- Yes, sir.

18:25.449 --> 18:26.915
Copy that description.

18:26.951 --> 18:29.251
All right, stay in your car, please.

18:56.180 --> 18:59.147
- Tony Gutiérrez?
- Yes, sir?

18:59.183 --> 19:00.849
I have some other officers that
would like to speak with you.

19:00.884 --> 19:02.484
Can I get you to come down and talk to them?

19:02.519 --> 19:03.371
Go where?

19:03.371 --> 19:04.959
They would like you to come down
to the P.D. and speak with them.

19:05.456 --> 19:07.556
- What for?
- They just want to ask you a few questions.

19:07.591 --> 19:08.790
You can leave your car here.

19:08.826 --> 19:09.992
That officer will take care of it.

19:10.027 --> 19:12.561
Can I get you to step out of your car, sir?

19:14.431 --> 19:16.565
Sir?

19:21.839 --> 19:23.138
Tony?

19:23.173 --> 19:24.973
I'm Chuck Palmer with the
Modesto Police Department.

19:25.009 --> 19:26.074
This is John Sanderson.

19:26.110 --> 19:27.509
He works with me.

19:27.544 --> 19:29.511
Tony, I want you to know your
father's already been contacted,

19:29.546 --> 19:31.179
and he's on his way down here.

19:31.215 --> 19:32.481
While we're waiting,

19:32.516 --> 19:34.816
I was hoping we could ask
you a couple questions.

19:34.852 --> 19:36.985
There's a few things we were
hoping you could help us with.

19:37.021 --> 19:38.820
What things?

19:38.856 --> 19:40.655
Is it okay if we ask you a few questions?

19:40.691 --> 19:42.157
Yes, sir.

19:42.192 --> 19:44.159
Okay, good.

19:44.194 --> 19:47.329
So, the car you were driving
when the police pulled you over,

19:47.364 --> 19:49.664
that's in possession of
your father's garage?

19:49.700 --> 19:52.501
Well, me and my dad, we work on it.

19:52.536 --> 19:54.336
It's just a hobby.

19:54.371 --> 19:57.839
But it's not currently
registered for street-legal use?

19:57.875 --> 20:00.509
I mean, I was just supposed
to blow out the soot.

20:00.544 --> 20:02.511
I know I'm not supposed
to be on the road with it.

20:02.546 --> 20:04.513
- Are you and your fa...
- Am I in trouble?

20:04.548 --> 20:05.847
Besides the two of you,

20:05.883 --> 20:08.850
- does anyone else have access to the vehicle?
- No.

20:08.886 --> 20:11.019
Nobody over the last few days?

20:11.055 --> 20:14.356
- No.
- What about Sunday night?

20:14.391 --> 20:16.858
Nobody drove it Sunday.

20:16.894 --> 20:18.860
What did you do Sunday night?

20:18.896 --> 20:20.862
I was at home.

20:20.898 --> 20:23.031
Did you watch football? Was it a good game?

20:23.067 --> 20:25.033
Did you watch it with your family?

20:25.069 --> 20:27.702
It's just my sister and my dad.

20:27.738 --> 20:28.770
That's it.

20:28.806 --> 20:30.772
So, you watched the game with them.

20:30.808 --> 20:31.807
I was in the garage,

20:31.842 --> 20:33.542
so I didn't get to watch the game.

20:33.577 --> 20:35.310
You were at the garage?

20:35.345 --> 20:37.312
Okay, from when to when?

20:37.347 --> 20:38.480
I'm not sure.

20:38.515 --> 20:41.016

I don't care. I don't care.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.133

- I don't care.

22:38.168 --> 22:40.802
Listen.

22:40.837 --> 22:45.307
Whatever I got to do... I'll handle it.

22:47.644 --> 22:48.777
Okay?

22:48.812 --> 22:53.448
I'm not letting you do that.

22:53.483 --> 22:55.617
All right?

22:55.652 --> 22:59.120
It's not real to me yet.

22:59.156 --> 23:01.323
The phone rings. I expect it to be Matt.

23:01.358 --> 23:03.158
It's people giving me condolences,

23:03.193 --> 23:05.660
but I can't take them.

23:06.997 --> 23:10.298
He's not... it doesn't...
feel like he's gone, so I...

23:10.334 --> 23:12.200
I don't know how to take
other people's grief?

23:12.236 --> 23:15.337
Mr. Skokie, when you got
the call from the police,

23:15.372 --> 23:17.172
what was your first reaction?

23:17.207 --> 23:19.674
Well, they weren't even sure it was him.

23:19.710 --> 23:22.510
Uh, so, I had to, uh, fly out.

23:22.546 --> 23:25.513
So I was just... I was hopeful, you know?

23:25.549 --> 23:29.851
The whole... whole trip over,
I was... it was a mistake.

23:29.886 --> 23:32.988
You know, I kept telling
myself that it was, um...

23:33.023 --> 23:35.991
The things I was able to
find out about your son...

23:36.026 --> 23:37.492
It seems like he was a
really good young man.

23:37.527 --> 23:40.161
Yeah.  Oh, yeah.

23:40.197 --> 23:42.030
He was in the military. Is that right?

23:42.065 --> 23:43.898
Yeah, he... yes, h-he
enlisted right after 9/11.

23:43.934 --> 23:45.900
He wanted to do his service.

23:45.936 --> 23:51.072
He was in Iraq, and h-he did
what was right for people.

23:51.108 --> 23:52.907
Married a beautiful young girl...

23:52.943 --> 23:54.242
Married his sweetheart.

23:54.278 --> 23:56.745
She was a beauty queen,
right? She was literally...

23:56.780 --> 23:59.748
Y... Gwen, uh, was Miss...
She was the runner-up

23:59.783 --> 24:02.584
for Miss, uh, Modesto six or seven years ago

24:02.619 --> 24:05.086
after Matt's service, right
when they moved out here.

24:05.122 --> 24:06.421
Perfect couple.

24:06.456 --> 24:09.257
He cared.

24:09.293 --> 24:12.427
And he was happy.

24:12.462 --> 24:15.363
Never mind that he did not
have it easy growing up.

24:15.399 --> 24:18.300
- You and your husband are separated?
- We're divorced.

24:18.335 --> 24:21.303
Me and the boys did not have a lot of money.

24:21.338 --> 24:22.704
We didn't have any money.

24:22.739 --> 24:27.542
It was hard for me to provide,
but Matt, his brother...

24:27.577 --> 24:30.545
Um, Matt's brother, Mark,
he's in the military, too.

24:30.580 --> 24:34.049
H-he's serving right now.

24:34.084 --> 24:38.320
They both grew up knowing that
they had to be responsible.

24:38.355 --> 24:42.324
A-and for s-something like
this to happen to Matt...

24:42.359 --> 24:43.992
What are the police telling you?

24:44.027 --> 24:47.062
Nothing. And they're not
doing much of anything.

24:47.097 --> 24:48.730
I know the one person they're looking for

24:48.765 --> 24:51.232
is an illegal... or something.

24:51.268 --> 24:53.401
It just f-figures...

24:53.437 --> 24:55.904
M-my son goes off to
another country to fight,

24:55.939 --> 24:57.906
then he comes home to America,

24:57.941 --> 25:00.742
and he gets killed by
somebody from another country.

25:00.777 --> 25:02.577
<i> I love you.</i>

25:02.612 --> 25:05.914
You don't have to
say things like that.

25:05.949 --> 25:09.084
You know... you didn't have
to tell him we're divorced

25:09.119 --> 25:11.119
or that you didn't have money
when the boys were young.

25:11.154 --> 25:12.287
Say something that wasn't true?

25:12.322 --> 25:13.621
It's not what you say, Barb.

25:13.657 --> 25:15.623
It's how you say things. It's just...

25:15.659 --> 25:17.959
I really don't care.

25:17.994 --> 25:19.961
You say it with happiness.

25:19.996 --> 25:22.464
I am proud that I was able to
take care of my children...

25:22.499 --> 25:23.539
<i>Our</i> children.

25:23.539 --> 25:24.931
That I was able to take care
of them when you <i> couldn't...</i>

25:24.931 --> 25:26.801
- <i>Our</i> children.
- Or when you <i> wouldn't.</i>

25:26.837 --> 25:30.138
I'm trying to get people to
find out who killed our son.

25:30.173 --> 25:32.640
And you sit there, and you...

25:32.676 --> 25:33.975
You worry about you. Stop the car.

25:34.010 --> 25:36.644
- I what? What are you...
- Stop the car. I'm getting out.

25:36.680 --> 25:39.147
I'm gonna get out of the damn
car unless... Stop the car.

25:39.182 --> 25:40.315
Stop it!

25:45.021 --> 25:47.822
- Stop the car.
- Barb.

25:47.858 --> 25:50.658
Don't you walk away from me.
That was 20 years ago.

25:50.694 --> 25:52.827
- I am not that same person.
- I am not here for you.

25:52.863 --> 25:54.996
Listen, I admit I had some problems.

25:55.031 --> 25:56.664
"Problems"?

25:56.700 --> 25:59.000
S-s-say what you did! Say what you did!

25:59.035 --> 26:00.502
Say what you did!

26:00.537 --> 26:02.170
You gambled away everything we had.

26:02.205 --> 26:04.172
Then you went and stole so
you could gamble some more.

26:04.207 --> 26:05.507
Yeah, it was... You were off in Vegas...

26:05.542 --> 26:07.242
- It was... It was an illness, Barb.
- Or Reno...

26:07.277 --> 26:08.343
- It was an illness. It was an addiction...
- Throwing away all our money.

26:08.378 --> 26:09.511
- And I got myself help.
- We had nothing.

26:09.546 --> 26:10.678
- And now I am recovered!
- We had nothing,

26:10.714 --> 26:12.847
raising those boys by
myself in public housing.

26:12.883 --> 26:14.682
Do you have any idea
what that was like? Huh?

26:14.718 --> 26:17.018
A-a white mother
and her two white kids...

26:17.053 --> 26:18.608
Do you know what those people did to us

26:18.608 --> 26:19.855
- day after day?
- Barb. Barb.

26:19.855 --> 26:21.856
- Do you know how those people treated my boys?
- Barb.

26:21.892 --> 26:25.527
- I am here trying to do what I can for Matt!
- Yeah.

26:25.562 --> 26:29.030
And your feelings are hurt
over what I say to a reporter?

26:29.065 --> 26:33.034
- Barb, Barb, come on.
- Stop saying my name!!

26:33.069 --> 26:35.203
Now is easy to be a father, Russ,

26:35.238 --> 26:39.207
when all you have to do is stand
in front of people and be sad.

26:39.242 --> 26:42.710
You think... you think this is easy for me?

26:42.746 --> 26:45.380
Do you have any idea how hard it was for me

26:45.415 --> 26:47.382
to earn back the love and
the trust of our boys...

26:47.417 --> 26:49.384
<i>Our</i> boys! Now get in!

26:49.419 --> 26:52.887
It must have been so hard.

26:52.923 --> 26:55.557
Just stay out of my way!

26:58.195 --> 27:01.496
Or walk if you want.

27:01.531 --> 27:04.999
Honest to God, I don't care.

27:42.321 --> 27:44.354
Got Mr. Gutiérrez.

27:44.390 --> 27:45.989
Mr. Gutiérrez. Chuck Palmer.

27:46.025 --> 27:49.326
Have a seat, please.

27:49.361 --> 27:52.162
Mr. Gutiérrez, we appreciate you coming in.

27:52.198 --> 27:53.664
Now, your son is not under arrest.

27:53.699 --> 27:55.199
Tony agreed to come in and speak with us,

27:55.234 --> 27:57.201
and he agreed to answer some questions

27:57.236 --> 27:58.802
outside of your presence, okay?

27:58.838 --> 28:00.037
Yes. All right.

28:00.072 --> 28:01.705
Now, there are a few more
questions that we have.

28:01.741 --> 28:04.041
Can we get you to help
answer a few questions for us?

28:04.076 --> 28:06.977
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

28:07.012 --> 28:09.513
Now, your son was stopped driving this car.

28:09.548 --> 28:12.015
Is that car in the possession
of your garage?

28:12.051 --> 28:15.185
I tell him to drive it around
the block when he has to,

28:15.221 --> 28:17.187
but he knows he's not supposed
to be on the street with that.

28:17.223 --> 28:19.690
And do you recall personally
operating that vehicle

28:19.725 --> 28:22.526
- outside of your property this past Sunday?
- Sunday? No.

28:22.561 --> 28:24.695
Would anyone else have
had access to the vehicle?

28:24.730 --> 28:26.196
We have the keys... Nobody else.

28:26.232 --> 28:27.564
Well, Mr. Gutiérrez,

28:27.600 --> 28:30.734
your son told us that he wasn't
at home on Sunday night.

28:30.770 --> 28:32.669
Do you recall if Tony was home with you?

28:32.705 --> 28:33.904
No, he wasn't at home.

28:33.939 --> 28:35.739
Mr. Gutiérrez, do you
know where your son was?

28:35.775 --> 28:37.908
Well, he told me he was working on the car.

28:37.943 --> 28:39.743
Tony, were you working on the car,

28:39.779 --> 28:42.980
or were you out riding around in it?

28:45.084 --> 28:47.718
Tony was telling us that
it's just you at home.

28:47.753 --> 28:49.386
- Is that right?
- Yes.

28:49.421 --> 28:51.188
My wife and I, we recently separated,

28:51.223 --> 28:52.356
so I know how hard it is...

28:52.391 --> 28:54.825
No, no, it's, uh, different. We didn't...

28:54.860 --> 28:59.329
My wife, Roberta, had a heart... thing.

28:59.365 --> 29:01.565
I'm very sorry about that.

29:01.600 --> 29:05.702
Mr. Gutiérrez, we need your
son to tell us what's going on.

29:05.738 --> 29:08.205
If he tells us what happened,
if he tells us the truth,

29:08.240 --> 29:09.540
then that's that.

29:09.575 --> 29:13.010
But if he lies to us, that's
going to be a problem.

29:13.045 --> 29:14.778
- <i>Papi, yo no he hecho nada.</i>
- Unh-unh. Not like that.

29:14.814 --> 29:16.613
If you have something to say, you say it.

29:16.649 --> 29:17.881
Are you lying to them?

29:17.917 --> 29:19.516
- Are you lying?
- No.

29:19.552 --> 29:21.051
- So that wasn't our car?
- I don't know.

29:21.086 --> 29:22.553
- Everything he's saying... That wasn't our car?
- <i>Ino hice nada!</i>

29:22.588 --> 29:24.254
Stop it! Stop lying! Do
you want to go to jail?

29:24.290 --> 29:27.090
- Huh? Do you want to be another cholo in jail?
- I want to go home.

29:27.126 --> 29:28.315
Then tell the truth.

29:28.315 --> 29:29.600
- Tell them what happened.
- I don't know.

29:29.600 --> 29:31.528
- What did you do?
- Nothing! You never let us do nothing!

29:31.564 --> 29:32.930
- I just wanted to make some money for myself!
- You're gonna blame me?

29:32.965 --> 29:34.565
Antonio, was that our car?!

29:38.470 --> 29:40.704
Yes.

29:46.178 --> 29:48.912
We... we always told
him... him and his sister...

29:48.948 --> 29:51.582
We always told them, "stay away from gangs.

29:51.617 --> 29:53.750
Stay away from drugs."

29:53.786 --> 29:55.018
Roberta and I,

29:55.054 --> 29:57.621
we came to this country the
right way... the right way.

29:57.656 --> 30:00.290
And we always told him,
"do things the right way."

30:00.326 --> 30:02.392
Yes, sir.

30:02.428 --> 30:05.729
So, he'll tell you whatever.

30:05.764 --> 30:10.267
Whatever it is, he's gonna tell you.

30:14.673 --> 30:16.607
What?

30:16.642 --> 30:17.941
Hey, it's Carter.

30:17.977 --> 30:19.109
Uh...

30:19.144 --> 30:22.446
You don't remember?

30:22.481 --> 30:25.282
Sean brought us around,
me and my girl aubry.

30:25.317 --> 30:26.650
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Where's she at?

30:26.685 --> 30:30.487
She wants to come party some.
Later, though. Not now.

30:30.522 --> 30:32.155
She's not feeling it right now, you know,

30:32.191 --> 30:33.257
- needs a little helping out.
- Nah, man, I got nothing.

30:33.292 --> 30:35.325
Hey, listen. Hey, oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:35.361 --> 30:36.660
I, loo... I-I-, uh...

30:36.695 --> 30:39.496
Look, I-I don't want nothing
for nothing, all right?

30:39.531 --> 30:42.833
All right? I just, uh... I
want to buy a little now.

30:42.868 --> 30:45.836
Then... then Aubry wants to
come back and get serious.

30:45.871 --> 30:47.537
Yeah?

30:47.573 --> 30:48.572
You want something to eat?

30:48.607 --> 30:49.907
I got some Chinese in the kitchen.

30:49.942 --> 30:51.742
Nah, man. Just...
Just want to do business.

30:51.777 --> 30:54.444
- That's all.
- Yeah, yeah. Just hang out a sec.

30:54.480 --> 30:57.014
All right. I'll be right here.

31:29.014 --> 31:30.647
This is all I got right now.

31:30.683 --> 31:32.883
That's cool.

31:32.918 --> 31:35.886
And, uh, Aubry, she's gonna come by later?

31:35.921 --> 31:38.889
Yeah, you know... If she's feeling it.

31:38.924 --> 31:42.726
Cool. All right. It's gonna be $40.

31:42.761 --> 31:44.561
I'm gonna bring Aubry back.

31:44.596 --> 31:46.563
Yeah, she wants to party with you.

31:46.598 --> 31:49.666
Yeah, yeah. It's still $40, man.

31:51.704 --> 31:53.036
Man, why you come over
here wasting my time, man?

31:53.072 --> 31:55.505
Go. Come back when you got
the money, man, all right?

31:55.541 --> 31:57.708
Just...

31:57.743 --> 32:00.377
Damn, man.

32:00.412 --> 32:01.778
Seriously?

32:05.084 --> 32:07.284
Look, man...

32:07.319 --> 32:09.252
Just give it to me, okay?

32:09.288 --> 32:13.090
Man, please, don't. Please, don't do...

32:18.797 --> 32:21.031
Bitch! Give it... to... me!

32:21.066 --> 32:23.367
You... white... bitch! Give it!

32:30.776 --> 32:33.577
- I got something for us.
- What?

32:33.612 --> 32:36.346
I told you I was gonna do it, right?

32:37.616 --> 32:38.615
Hmm?

32:38.650 --> 32:39.649
Mm-hmm.

32:45.824 --> 32:48.458
I want to show you something.
You know what I got?

32:48.494 --> 32:50.761
Open it up.

32:52.431 --> 32:55.999
We could put it up with your the collection.

33:08.113 --> 33:09.579
Adam was the first one.

33:09.615 --> 33:11.915
Adam is...?

33:11.950 --> 33:13.917
He's this kid at school.

33:13.952 --> 33:15.419
I was showing him the car one day,

33:15.454 --> 33:18.155
and... he starts going off.

33:18.190 --> 33:22.159
"That's bad. That's sick.
I want to drive that."

33:22.194 --> 33:25.328
And, you know, I told him,
"no, you can't drive it."

33:25.364 --> 33:27.164
But then he pulls out $20.

33:27.199 --> 33:30.000
I mean, $20 just to take it out riding?

33:30.035 --> 33:31.068
I'm cool with that.

33:31.103 --> 33:32.302
I mean, a week later,

33:32.337 --> 33:34.638
a couple weeks later,
h-he comes back around.

33:34.673 --> 33:37.007
Another 20 bucks just to take it out riding.

33:37.042 --> 33:39.009
So it just got to be a thing.

33:39.044 --> 33:41.178
I mean, he had friends and
stuff, so I just started...

33:41.213 --> 33:43.280
You were renting our car?

33:43.315 --> 33:46.817
Let's... talk about Sunday night.

33:48.487 --> 33:49.953
Adam,

33:49.988 --> 33:53.790
he knows this guy that's
looking for a car for the night.

33:53.826 --> 33:56.493
And he's wanting to front me $50.

33:56.528 --> 33:58.795
- I mean, $50.
- W-what do you need that you don't have?

33:58.831 --> 34:00.730
I want to know about this other guy.

34:02.835 --> 34:07.137
He shows up.

34:07.172 --> 34:09.672
He's for real. You know what I'm saying?

34:09.708 --> 34:10.907
He was in a gang?

34:10.943 --> 34:14.411
H-he was scary.

34:14.446 --> 34:15.579
That's all I know.

34:15.614 --> 34:18.748
I mean, he gave me the money.

34:18.784 --> 34:21.083
He took the car.

34:21.120 --> 34:24.087
I thought he was gonna
steal it, but he came back.

34:24.123 --> 34:25.455
I mean, after that,

34:25.491 --> 34:29.359
he started texting me
sometimes... looking for a car.

34:29.393 --> 34:32.395
Every time, it was $50.

34:32.431 --> 34:36.233
You have the phone were texting him from?

34:36.268 --> 34:38.068
I erased them.

34:38.103 --> 34:39.703
I still need the phone.

34:47.579 --> 34:49.545
Could you wait here, please?

34:51.917 --> 34:54.551
The computer should
be back up in a minute.

34:54.585 --> 34:58.054
Uh, you mind, uh, just
waiting for a little bit more?

34:58.090 --> 34:59.556
That's fine.

35:11.770 --> 35:15.071
Hey, um, I'm gonna use my phone real quick.

35:15.107 --> 35:16.239
All right.

35:29.087 --> 35:30.887
That's him!

35:45.912 --> 35:46.669
No, I didn't tell you.

35:46.669 --> 35:48.746
I had to go to my kid's
open house last night.

35:48.905 --> 35:50.787
Get some suction in here,
please. No, no, it was, like,

35:50.787 --> 35:53.137
hours of us sitting on those
little stools, you know?

35:57.462 --> 35:59.975
Hector. You hear me?

36:03.363 --> 36:04.641
Let me tell you where we are.

36:04.641 --> 36:05.880
We've got a witness who can put a car

36:05.880 --> 36:07.287
on the scene of a homicide,

36:07.287 --> 36:09.312
and we've got somebody
who can put you in that car.

36:09.499 --> 36:11.864
We've got credit card and
I.D. belonging to the vic

36:11.864 --> 36:12.942
in your possession.

36:12.942 --> 36:14.690
- I didn't kill nobody.
- Who did?

36:16.920 --> 36:19.023
Why they got to shoot me?

36:19.073 --> 36:20.468
Who did?

36:27.624 --> 36:31.618
We're pulling your jacket.
What are we gonna find?

36:31.911 --> 36:34.223
Robbery, assault?

36:34.382 --> 36:37.098
- I don't do nothing violent.
- Then there's no problem.

36:38.319 --> 36:39.744
What's this car thing about?

36:39.744 --> 36:42.457
I just needed wheels, needed to be mobile.

36:42.457 --> 36:44.735
What for? Do some hustling, deal some drugs?

36:46.210 --> 36:48.169
Look, Hector, it's on somebody else,

36:49.365 --> 36:50.861
or it's on you.

36:56.813 --> 36:58.659
There's this black dude.

36:59.360 --> 37:01.558
Him and his girl are a couple of meth heads.

37:01.558 --> 37:04.103
He's a regular cust. He's
always looking to buy.

37:04.103 --> 37:06.257
He comes to me Sunday. I get him some.

37:06.257 --> 37:09.081
He starts rolling. He
wants more, but he's broke.

37:09.081 --> 37:11.025
And I tell this fool I
can't do nothing for him.

37:11.025 --> 37:13.805
And he starts getting puffed up, hyped up,

37:13.805 --> 37:15.264
talking about how he's owed,

37:15.264 --> 37:17.476
how he needs to settle up a score.

37:17.652 --> 37:20.016
Says there's this white guy that owes him.

37:20.641 --> 37:22.818
He tells me he can get me paid after.

37:22.861 --> 37:23.914
After what?

37:23.914 --> 37:26.002
After... that don't matter to me.

37:26.002 --> 37:27.635
So, I don't know nothing about it.

37:27.635 --> 37:29.885
All I had to do was run him over to Slauson.

37:29.885 --> 37:32.054
Tell me... Why they got to shoot me?!

37:32.852 --> 37:34.563
What address?

37:35.162 --> 37:37.406
I ain't going anywhere with no meth head.

37:38.118 --> 37:40.120
I take him over to the
mini-mall and hang out.

37:40.120 --> 37:42.103
He goes off. Dude comes back.

37:42.103 --> 37:44.333
Cash, cards... I don't know how he got it.

37:45.439 --> 37:47.132
I didn't ask.

37:48.778 --> 37:50.602
You know how to find this guy?

37:52.992 --> 37:54.962
You know why you shot me?

37:56.613 --> 37:59.180
'Cause you don't give a damn about me.

38:01.984 --> 38:05.085
Yeah. I know where he's at.

And why did you
erase those texts, huh?

38:40.874 --> 38:42.445
The one's from your phone?

38:42.445 --> 38:44.011
'Cause you knew you were
doing something wrong.

38:44.011 --> 38:44.674
You knew it.

38:44.674 --> 38:46.688
No, I always erase my texts.

38:46.885 --> 38:48.675
I know you go through my phone.

38:48.675 --> 38:51.882
I'm your father. I want to know
what's going on in your life.

38:51.882 --> 38:53.811
- You treat us like babies.
- You don't tell me what's going on.

38:53.811 --> 38:54.449
You're always checking up on us!

38:54.449 --> 38:56.283
- You never tell me anything.
- Tony.

38:56.283 --> 38:57.761
Could I get you to stand up for me, please?

38:57.761 --> 38:58.481
Why?

38:58.481 --> 39:00.024
Stand up and put your
hands behind your back.

39:00.024 --> 39:01.461
W-w-what's going on?

39:01.947 --> 39:04.305
- You're under arrest for murder.
- I didn't kill nobody.

39:04.305 --> 39:05.034
You have the right to remain silent.

39:05.034 --> 39:07.032
W-what? No. No. No, no. He was driving.

39:07.085 --> 39:08.285
- I didn't kill anybody.
- No, he was driving the car!

39:08.285 --> 39:09.873
- That's all he was doing!
- You never said the words!

39:09.873 --> 39:12.487
- <i>Papi!</i>
- He just took the car!

39:12.487 --> 39:13.984
Anything you say may be used as
evidence against you in a court of law.

39:13.984 --> 39:15.296
- I didn't kill... <i> Papi!</i>
- No, no, no, no. No!

39:15.296 --> 39:19.104
Aah! Help me!

39:21.132 --> 39:22.578
Help me!

39:31.236 --> 39:31.809
Hi, Aubry.

39:31.809 --> 39:34.108
My name is Tanea, and I'm gonna
be taking care of you today.

39:34.550 --> 39:36.290
You look like you're pretty beat up.

39:36.478 --> 39:39.274
Can you tell me how this happened to you?

39:40.392 --> 39:42.891
Okay, I'm gonna feel your
nose and around the front part

39:42.891 --> 39:44.765
of your face next, okay?

39:44.765 --> 39:46.851
Again, any tenderness?

39:46.851 --> 39:48.366
You could talk to us.

39:48.366 --> 39:49.881
- You doing okay?
- You can help us.

39:49.881 --> 39:50.836
Does that hurt at all?

39:50.836 --> 39:52.303
Did he do that to you?

39:52.303 --> 39:53.383
I'm gonna feel your neck now.

39:54.266 --> 39:56.162
You don't have to protect him anymore.

39:56.610 --> 39:59.551
You got to start thinking
about yourself, not him.

39:59.551 --> 40:00.322
Any tenderness through here?

40:00.946 --> 40:03.036
Got some pretty
mean scratches here.

40:03.036 --> 40:04.768
We have four suspects in custody...

40:04.768 --> 40:07.680
Two who facilitated and one
who we believe is the shooter.

40:07.832 --> 40:10.066
We're going to be transferring
them to the jail for booking.

40:10.066 --> 40:11.855
Did he say why h-he did it?

40:11.855 --> 40:13.343
- He won't talk.
- But he did it?

40:13.594 --> 40:14.863
Well, a gun was recovered,

40:14.863 --> 40:16.461
so we're confident we can make the case.

40:16.461 --> 40:18.886
I read where, uh, with the
appeals and everything,

40:18.930 --> 40:21.881
it can take 12 years maybe
to execute somebody.

40:21.881 --> 40:22.919
Is that true?

40:22.919 --> 40:25.584
We have a long way to go
before we even get there.

40:25.784 --> 40:27.309
I want to see him.

40:31.315 --> 40:32.979
I want to see him.

40:41.286 --> 40:42.380
Chuck.

40:42.380 --> 40:44.259
Chris Thompson just brought this in.

40:45.303 --> 40:46.767
You need to go talk to her.

40:46.813 --> 40:49.777
You handle her. I got to
get Skokie to talk to Chris.

41:31.965 --> 41:33.696
Mr. Skokie, this is Chris Thompson,

41:33.696 --> 41:34.907
one of our investigators.

41:34.907 --> 41:35.758
She has a couple of things

41:35.758 --> 41:37.105
she'd like to ask you, if that's okay.

41:37.105 --> 41:38.244
Okay.

41:38.536 --> 41:39.781
Mr. Skokie,

41:39.781 --> 41:41.272
you had a good relationship with your son.

41:41.272 --> 41:42.842
You talked to him regularly.

41:42.842 --> 41:46.042
Did he ever discuss aspects
of his lifestyle with you,

41:46.042 --> 41:48.499
or did you ever feel like he
wasn't forthcoming with you,

41:48.499 --> 41:50.451
that he was hiding something from you?

41:50.451 --> 41:52.550
N-no. No, Matt never hid anything with me.

41:52.608 --> 41:54.378
We talked all the time. We talked about...

41:54.442 --> 41:56.215
We talked about his job, and, uh, you know,

41:56.215 --> 41:57.713
I know he was happy with Gwen.

41:57.713 --> 42:00.608
Did you ever get the sense
that he was involved in drugs?

42:00.608 --> 42:03.079
No. No, no. No, no, no, no.

42:03.127 --> 42:05.534
I... I would know if he were on drugs.

42:06.589 --> 42:07.457
Mr. Skokie...

42:07.457 --> 42:09.721
I mean, you know,
t-that's... That's just not...

42:09.721 --> 42:10.824
I would know.

42:10.881 --> 42:13.376
I would know if my son was having problems.

42:13.376 --> 42:15.178
We don't know that your son

42:15.178 --> 42:16.431
was having personal problems with drugs.

42:16.431 --> 42:18.031
- What was found...
- In our search of his property,

42:18.031 --> 42:20.633
we recovered a large quantity
of crystallized methamphetamine

42:20.633 --> 42:21.882
and cannabis.

42:21.882 --> 42:23.464
The amount and the way it was packaged

42:23.464 --> 42:25.350
and the fact that it was securely hidden

42:25.350 --> 42:28.314
indicates that it was
not all for his own use.

42:31.416 --> 42:33.091
Do you understand what I'm saying?

42:34.659 --> 42:37.264
M-m-Matt... Matt and I were close.

42:38.031 --> 42:39.870
I mean, I w... I would
know something like that.

42:41.624 --> 42:43.531
M-Matt would have... would have told me.

42:43.531 --> 42:46.767
Would your son have told
you if he was a drug dealer?
