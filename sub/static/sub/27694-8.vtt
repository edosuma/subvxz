01:38.307 --> 01:40.720
<i>"What will become of you and me</i>

01:42.311 --> 01:44.849
<i>"besides the photo and the memory?</i>

01:46.398 --> 01:50.187
<i>"This is the school in which we learn</i>

01:50.277 --> 01:54.191

01:55.949 --> 01:58.862

01:59.995 --> 02:05.207
<i>"What am I now that I was then,
which I shall suffer and act again?</i>

02:07.419 --> 02:10.627
"The children shouting

02:11.465 --> 02:14.128
"This is the school
in which they learn.

02:15.218 --> 02:18.211
"What am I now that I was then?

02:18.639 --> 02:21.347
"May memory restore again and again

02:21.642 --> 02:24.305
"the smallest color
of the smallest day.

02:24.770 --> 02:28.229
"Time is the school in which we learn,

02:28.940 --> 02:30.852
"time is the fire in which we burn."

02:48.043 --> 02:49.250
Touring backroads?

02:52.381 --> 02:53.997
I've seen them all.

02:56.843 --> 02:58.630
Wanted privacy.

03:00.472 --> 03:03.590
My hope being
that we could resolve this situation,

03:03.975 --> 03:06.388
just the two of us.

03:08.063 --> 03:10.555
What situation is that?

03:11.650 --> 03:13.016
Don't do that.

03:14.528 --> 03:17.316
You got in the car.
You know what this is about.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.429
You were Army, correct?

03:48.854 --> 03:49.935
Recon.

03:51.273 --> 03:52.684
Saw combat?

03:54.776 --> 03:56.267
Many times.

03:59.114 --> 04:01.197
I was 7th Infantry.

04:02.117 --> 04:03.278
Korea.

04:04.035 --> 04:05.196
Chosin.

04:06.329 --> 04:10.118
We took all the casualties,
so the Marines could turn tail.

04:11.209 --> 04:12.871
Thirty below zero.

04:14.171 --> 04:16.504
Lost about 5,000 men.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.236
I wouldn't imagine
a man like you

04:20.260 --> 04:22.752
meets with a man like me
to trade war stories.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.172
We're both soldiers.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.679
You understand triage.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.895
My man Harris James.

04:35.942 --> 04:38.059
I wanna know what happened to him.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.229
Something happen to him?

04:43.325 --> 04:45.783
Spoke a couple days ago
up at your offices.

04:47.329 --> 04:50.447
Don't start off by lying to me,
Mr. Hays.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.910
The last time I saw him,
all we did was talk.

04:55.003 --> 04:57.290
What did you talk about?

04:59.216 --> 05:00.548
Julie Purcell.

05:02.260 --> 05:06.595
That's the girl who went missing,
been in the news again recent.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.557
What did he say about her?

05:11.478 --> 05:14.516
Can't talk details,
since it's ongoing.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.853
But you think Harris
had something to do with this girl?

05:18.318 --> 05:19.934
Yes, sir, I believe he did.

05:21.112 --> 05:22.819
Him and some others.

05:25.242 --> 05:28.201
And you got no idea
where he might be?

05:31.665 --> 05:35.659
Might be he took off.
We got him worried.

05:35.752 --> 05:38.210
Cameras all around corporate.

05:38.755 --> 05:41.873
Access roads to the plants,
everywhere.

05:42.133 --> 05:44.716
Video of Harris's car
pulling out of the gate,

05:45.178 --> 05:47.841
followed a minute later
by your cruiser.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.719
Just had to follow up
with some questions.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.470
Man's a hell of a talker.

05:55.772 --> 05:59.516
I give you chance after chance
to speak plainly to me,

05:59.609 --> 06:02.443
and you keep throwing shit in my face.

06:02.988 --> 06:04.149
You know, sir,

06:05.782 --> 06:08.195
I always respected you
and your family.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.242
Family.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.580
That's what it's...

06:21.464 --> 06:23.046
We only had the one.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.293
Then Ellen got sick.

06:30.682 --> 06:32.890
Now our child's gone, too.

06:40.942 --> 06:43.434
Something you want
to get off your chest, sir?

06:45.989 --> 06:47.321
Nobody's gonna hear it but us.

06:53.121 --> 06:54.407
Mr. Hoyt,

06:55.957 --> 06:58.415
you wanna tell me about Julie Purcell?

06:59.794 --> 07:02.002
I don't know about Julie Purcell.

07:02.839 --> 07:05.081
I'm in the fucking dark.

07:07.010 --> 07:08.376
And, well...

07:09.054 --> 07:12.513
I guess Harris
didn't talk enough after all.

07:14.351 --> 07:16.092
We know about the kids' uncle.

07:17.562 --> 07:19.895
Phone calls from the mother, Lucy.

07:21.274 --> 07:25.359
Harris going to Vegas,
same time she OD'ed.

07:25.820 --> 07:27.231
What I know,

07:27.781 --> 07:30.774
Harris's work beeper, newest thing,

07:31.618 --> 07:35.658
has a little computer chip
keyed to our corporate system.

07:36.206 --> 07:38.493
Includes a GPS signal.

07:39.376 --> 07:40.708
And I have exact coordinates

07:40.794 --> 07:44.788
where Harris last was
before it went dead.

07:46.675 --> 07:48.541
Now, you being the law,

07:49.344 --> 07:51.461
and me an interested party,

07:52.806 --> 07:55.139
should the two of us
go out to those woods,

07:55.225 --> 07:57.342
see if we can't find Harris James?

07:57.727 --> 07:59.844
And can you tell me, Mr. Hays,

08:00.730 --> 08:03.973
are we gonna need fucking shovels?

08:04.359 --> 08:07.067
You wanna swap confessions?

08:07.612 --> 08:10.195
Just what is it you think I did?

08:11.116 --> 08:14.780
That's why you bringing me here?
So you could see how much I know?

08:17.414 --> 08:20.031
Word is your investigation ended.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.492
So, we're done now.

08:22.585 --> 08:24.668
They can do what they want
with the investigation.

08:24.754 --> 08:26.620
That's not gonna stop me from looking.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.581
You heard that hotline call.

08:28.675 --> 08:31.008
Sounds like
she doesn't wanna be found.

08:32.095 --> 08:35.212
Maybe, Mr. Hays, best thing
you could do for that young woman

08:36.390 --> 08:38.678
is leave her in peace.

08:38.852 --> 08:42.061
Hard walking away knowing
people mean to do her harm.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.263
Well,

08:44.274 --> 08:47.767
if the police ain't looking for her,
and you're not,

08:48.653 --> 08:51.020
can't imagine anybody else'd be.

08:51.114 --> 08:55.449
In fact,
I can practically guarantee it.

08:56.327 --> 08:57.613
Otherwise,

08:58.663 --> 09:00.950
could be you're giving
these people you mention

09:01.041 --> 09:03.203
reason to find her.

09:03.793 --> 09:07.207
See, you don't drop it,

09:09.257 --> 09:12.216
there's others can't either.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.629
What happened?

09:17.515 --> 09:19.472
Just tell me what happened!

09:19.559 --> 09:21.721
I don't know what happened.

09:21.811 --> 09:24.178
Do I look like a man
with fucking answers?

09:25.648 --> 09:27.514
Maybe one day I'll come see you.

09:29.527 --> 09:32.065
Try having this talk again.

09:32.781 --> 09:35.398
That you hoping
to get your balls back?

09:36.576 --> 09:39.819
Or truly wanting me
to regard you as a threat?

09:41.081 --> 09:43.414
Think about what that'd mean
to your family,

09:44.375 --> 09:46.662
you being a murderer and all.

09:46.961 --> 09:49.669
Think about what
it'd mean for that girl.

09:51.174 --> 09:55.168
Mr. Hays, do you want me
to feel threatened?

10:05.855 --> 10:08.472
I'll let you find your own way back.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.701
No way Harris would've run off.

10:21.204 --> 10:22.740
He loved his family.

10:23.540 --> 10:25.327
He was a wonderful father.

10:26.584 --> 10:28.496
I'm sorry about that.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.753
Wondering if maybe
you could speak toward

10:31.840 --> 10:33.797
an old associate of your husband's?

10:34.092 --> 10:36.675
Was a black man with one eye.

10:37.762 --> 10:40.675
You ever see your husband
with someone like that?

10:40.765 --> 10:42.176
Know who it might be?

10:45.353 --> 10:46.764
Why are you asking?

10:48.022 --> 10:51.641
We're trying to find a person
in connection with something else.

10:52.360 --> 10:56.195
Description come up a few times,
we can't get a name.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.823
You sure you never saw
a man like that?

11:05.790 --> 11:08.032
A man like that came by the house

11:09.085 --> 11:11.247
few weeks after Harris disappeared.

11:12.172 --> 11:16.257
I don't like to think about it.
I was upset at the time.

11:17.427 --> 11:22.263
He had one white eye and a scar.
He said he knew Harris.

11:22.557 --> 11:24.048
He upset me.

11:24.517 --> 11:25.928
Did he want something?

11:26.019 --> 11:29.057
He asked did I know
if Harris had found the girl.

11:30.481 --> 11:34.896
I thought maybe he meant
Harris hadn't been faithful to me.

11:35.445 --> 11:37.778
- I ran him off.
- Tell you his name?

11:38.156 --> 11:40.990
He introduced himself
as Junius something.

11:41.701 --> 11:44.489
He upset me. I made him leave.

11:46.998 --> 11:48.364
Junius.

11:50.627 --> 11:53.335
You wanna bet that's Mr. June?

11:54.923 --> 11:57.757
Making his name Junius Watts, maybe?

11:59.594 --> 12:01.005
Worth a try.

12:01.638 --> 12:04.051
I checked with a gal
from state records

12:04.140 --> 12:05.722
about the Hoyt place.

12:06.601 --> 12:08.934
Been held in trust by the estate.

12:10.313 --> 12:11.520
Nobody's living there.

12:14.192 --> 12:15.524
So?

12:16.027 --> 12:18.519
The old maid the other day?

12:19.906 --> 12:22.614
She talked about
some area they couldn't go.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.201
I wanna look at it.

12:27.956 --> 12:29.367
Well...

12:31.084 --> 12:34.122
I guess
you're lead detective now, Lieutenant.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.250
Goddamn right I am.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.591
You couldn't help yourself,
could you?

12:47.225 --> 12:48.306
Sir?

12:49.310 --> 12:52.519
"Purcell Investigation
Brought to False Conclusion.

12:52.897 --> 12:55.731
"Sources Say Case Far from Solved."

12:57.944 --> 13:02.814
And what sources, Detective Hays,
could this headline be alluding to?

13:04.659 --> 13:05.659
I didn't know...

13:05.743 --> 13:08.326
We're looking at suing
your little girlfriend.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.579
I haven't read the papers.

13:14.085 --> 13:16.668
"An anonymous source
in the investigation

13:16.754 --> 13:18.666
"insists that there are
a number of clues

13:18.756 --> 13:20.463
"and suspicious facts

13:20.550 --> 13:24.009

in favor of a hasty conviction

13:24.095 --> 13:25.927
"of the West Finger shooter."

13:26.431 --> 13:29.549
Your man here, he suggested
you got taken advantage.

13:30.143 --> 13:33.602
Like you're too pussy-struck
to have known what she was doing.

13:33.688 --> 13:36.476
We think you owe the department
your own op-ed.

13:36.566 --> 13:40.856
You're gonna write a statement
explaining that fragments of hearsay

13:40.945 --> 13:42.561
were used without your consent,

13:42.947 --> 13:44.609
the facts were misrepresented,

13:44.699 --> 13:48.409
that the woman who wrote this
did so without your cooperation.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.336
I'm not much of a writer.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.914
Well, we'll write it for you.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.215
All you gotta do is sign.

14:05.094 --> 14:08.462
- Purple, think about it...
- Say "thank you," Wayne.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.350
Just make it right, man.

14:17.565 --> 14:20.182
You got carried away.
Walk it back now.

14:22.320 --> 14:23.902
If I don't?

14:24.739 --> 14:27.356
D Company needs
a new public information officer.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.612
Administration.

14:30.161 --> 14:33.825
You'll never work
another Major Crimes investigation.

14:34.040 --> 14:37.499
Or you could just quit.

14:52.809 --> 14:55.051
You are one lucky mother.

14:57.730 --> 15:01.519
You know how hard I had to work,
get them to give you another shot?

15:01.609 --> 15:04.022
- Appreciate it.
- Yeah.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.691
Hey, listen to me.

15:08.074 --> 15:11.442
You don't ever do any kind of shit
like this to me again.

15:11.994 --> 15:15.203
I can't figure what you were thinking.

15:19.460 --> 15:20.460
Hey.

15:22.088 --> 15:23.329
What the hell are you doing?

15:24.048 --> 15:25.789
You heard them. I'm done.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.169
What?

15:27.927 --> 15:30.544
I get them to give you a pass,
and you're quittin'?

15:31.097 --> 15:34.090
- Oh, I'm not quitting.
- You can't.

15:34.517 --> 15:37.635
This is pride, Wayne,
and it's fucking you up.

15:38.020 --> 15:41.479
Take a breath, count to 10,
and sign their goddamn paper.

15:42.400 --> 15:43.811
No.

15:43.901 --> 15:45.358
Public Information?

15:46.612 --> 15:49.980
You hate the public.
You're a detective.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.107
You don't do shit like this.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.632
Anything anybody
might've said about you...

15:54.745 --> 15:57.533
- What'd they say about me?
- That you're a professional.

15:58.541 --> 16:01.625
I mean, they used to say that.

16:07.425 --> 16:10.042
Got away from me, man.
I was pissed off.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.799
Didn't really think it through.

16:14.348 --> 16:16.089
It's not like me, you're right.

16:16.184 --> 16:18.551
Okay. All right, there we go.

16:18.644 --> 16:22.103
I mean, you just sign their statement,
and let's you and me move on.

16:23.524 --> 16:26.483
Except then, I'd be burning her.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.436
Calling her a liar.

16:30.198 --> 16:31.780
She didn't really do nothing wrong.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.157
She didn't lie,

16:35.244 --> 16:37.031
and I'm not saying she did.

16:38.039 --> 16:41.953
So what? This is your job. Our job.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.371
You're my partner.

16:45.963 --> 16:48.046
That's it?
You're just gonna go be a typist?

16:48.633 --> 16:50.670
Probably a lot less bullshit.

16:52.261 --> 16:55.629
Couple years, maybe it all blows over.

16:56.224 --> 16:57.681
I can outlast them.

16:58.768 --> 17:00.100
What about us?

17:01.437 --> 17:02.894
What you talking about?

17:05.148 --> 17:07.357
Grab a beer, go to a game.

17:07.859 --> 17:11.069
Not like we're not
gonna see each other, man.

18:16.304 --> 18:17.966
Suppose somebody catches us?

18:19.140 --> 18:21.757
We're old and confused.

20:29.478 --> 20:30.889
This is where they kept her.

20:32.606 --> 20:35.098
This is where she ran away from.

20:50.291 --> 20:51.827
Twenty-five years,

20:53.294 --> 20:54.535
and we just...

20:59.175 --> 21:00.175
All this...

21:02.845 --> 21:04.837
All this goddamn time.

21:09.393 --> 21:10.679
What the hell have I...

21:12.480 --> 21:15.018
What the hell were you doing?

21:25.701 --> 21:27.613
Thought it was the right thing.

21:29.079 --> 21:30.445
I had a family.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.616
Now, that must be nice.

22:24.468 --> 22:27.302
I find you burning your clothes
in the middle of the night.

22:28.264 --> 22:31.302
This morning you disappear
after a phone call.

22:32.726 --> 22:36.891
If you've got somebody else,
I can take it, just say so.

22:37.189 --> 22:39.556
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

22:41.819 --> 22:44.152
It's the case.

22:44.738 --> 22:46.775
It was only ever the case.

22:48.742 --> 22:50.108
And it's over now.

22:50.202 --> 22:52.489
What part of the case

22:52.580 --> 22:56.574
made you burn your suit
at 3:00 in the morning?

22:59.003 --> 23:00.619
The bad part.

23:05.259 --> 23:07.501
Can I get you a drink?

23:07.887 --> 23:10.049
I'd prefer a straight answer.

23:11.140 --> 23:12.847
I know what you'd prefer.

23:13.767 --> 23:16.851
But supposing that answer
would be dangerous to you?

23:17.271 --> 23:21.481
I'll take a hard truth
over a nice lie any day.

23:26.697 --> 23:28.563
We never really established this,

23:29.658 --> 23:31.069
'cause when we met,

23:33.203 --> 23:34.694
I told you too much.

23:35.998 --> 23:38.581
And then for a long time,
I wasn't really a cop.

23:38.667 --> 23:41.125
But there are aspects of my job,

23:42.588 --> 23:45.456
things I've seen, things I know,

23:46.216 --> 23:47.548
it's not for sharing.

23:48.385 --> 23:49.385
And this

23:51.013 --> 23:53.005
wouldn't do anything but cause harm.

23:55.517 --> 23:58.760
Maybe it's not for you to decide
what's harmful or not for me.

23:58.854 --> 24:00.061
Except I already did.

24:00.147 --> 24:02.480
It's something
we should decide together.

24:02.566 --> 24:03.773
No, we shouldn't.

24:05.736 --> 24:07.602
And that is my whole point.

24:10.824 --> 24:12.531
I might have a problem with that,

24:12.618 --> 24:15.531
because this morning you said
you'd tell me everything.

24:15.746 --> 24:17.237
That was a mistake.

24:20.709 --> 24:22.496
And I just realized now

24:23.712 --> 24:25.624
that I want your approval,

24:25.714 --> 24:28.752
and sometimes I do the wrong thing
because it's what you want.

24:33.430 --> 24:36.173
I'd like to stop that going forward.

24:36.350 --> 24:38.182
Are we going forward?

24:41.188 --> 24:44.852
How do we
with this big secret between us?

24:49.446 --> 24:51.859
Maybe that's what
we're really talking about.

24:53.325 --> 24:56.033
There's always been
this big secret between us.

24:57.121 --> 24:59.864
And it's that you and me,

25:01.166 --> 25:04.876
who we are together,
this marriage, our children,

25:06.714 --> 25:10.754
it's all tied up

25:11.844 --> 25:14.712
in a dead boy and a missing girl.

25:23.272 --> 25:25.104
I'll take that drink now.

25:47.212 --> 25:48.794
Bud and a shot of Jack.

26:03.562 --> 26:06.726
- You got a problem, little man?
- No. No.

26:07.149 --> 26:09.391
No, sir. No problem here.

26:09.693 --> 26:12.356
Then put your fucking eyes
somewhere else.

26:17.868 --> 26:19.154
What it is,

26:20.204 --> 26:21.945
I'm just a fan of romance.

26:22.873 --> 26:24.455
May I ask you a question?

26:25.375 --> 26:27.788
She look like that
before you rode across country?

26:29.797 --> 26:32.585
What the fuck did you say,
you little midget?

26:32.674 --> 26:34.791
See, I always wondered,

26:34.885 --> 26:37.377
all these butt-faced
human pieces of garbage

26:37.471 --> 26:39.053
out there walking the Earth,

26:40.140 --> 26:41.347
who's making them?

26:41.809 --> 26:44.392
I mean, what kind
of Frankenstein monsters

26:44.478 --> 26:45.685
are out there copulating

26:45.771 --> 26:48.559
to create all these hunks-of-shit
people in the world?

26:49.650 --> 26:51.357
Then I come in this bar,

26:51.902 --> 26:53.985
and here's you two,
giving me the answer

26:54.071 --> 26:57.235
I've been looking for
my whole fucking life.

27:05.833 --> 27:07.449
You done bucking, cowboy?

27:07.876 --> 27:09.333
Thank God it was you hit me,

27:09.419 --> 27:11.911
instead of that woolly mammoth
you're fucking.

27:39.283 --> 27:42.651
Last night, listening just now,

27:44.413 --> 27:48.828
I've wondered,
maybe we don't really know each other.

27:51.503 --> 27:52.789
Because you're right,

27:52.880 --> 27:56.749
what you said about us
and the Purcell kids.

27:59.219 --> 28:01.336
We never really talked about it
in that way.

28:01.430 --> 28:03.012
What it meant for us.

28:05.267 --> 28:07.429
But it's 10 years later.

28:10.022 --> 28:13.561
You write the story,
you get past the start,

28:15.402 --> 28:18.645
it's important to know
how you want it to end.

28:20.490 --> 28:22.482
You were pregnant yesterday,

28:23.327 --> 28:25.569
and now Henry's nine.

28:27.247 --> 28:29.955
I blink, he'll be out the house.

28:32.211 --> 28:35.204
If we get there, I don't wanna wonder
how it all happened.

28:36.381 --> 28:40.591
I don't think one date night a month
is gonna get us where we need to be.

28:40.677 --> 28:44.637
I'm writing this sequel,
you're on Major Crimes.

28:49.770 --> 28:51.636
They tanked the case again.

28:53.190 --> 28:54.977
Same as '80.

28:57.986 --> 28:59.477
I ought to quit.

29:00.030 --> 29:02.522
I've thought you should quit
for 10 years.

29:03.242 --> 29:05.279
- Why?
- "Why?"

29:05.369 --> 29:07.907
Why wouldn't I want you to quit?

29:09.331 --> 29:11.744
I don't think you realize this, Wayne,

29:12.167 --> 29:15.001
you could've been good
at just about anything.

29:15.837 --> 29:19.501
But what you think you are,
it made you stuck.

29:23.262 --> 29:25.094
I never went to college.

29:26.014 --> 29:27.471
Or California.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.011
I listened to my ma.

29:30.811 --> 29:33.224
I was in the Army, then PD.

29:37.192 --> 29:41.983
Maybe I got too good
at doing what I was told.

29:43.865 --> 29:47.529
I always think about why
you said you joined the Army.

29:47.995 --> 29:50.237
Didn't have money for school,
or no job...

29:50.330 --> 29:51.821
No, you told me,

29:53.667 --> 29:58.332
you said you figured that if you died,

30:01.174 --> 30:02.610
that your mom would be rich,

30:02.634 --> 30:04.796
because the government
would give her $10,000,

30:04.886 --> 30:07.754
and that's why you ended up joining.

30:12.185 --> 30:13.185
Uh...

30:16.982 --> 30:18.063
I think we both...

30:19.818 --> 30:22.856
We want something,
we get real single-minded.

30:24.573 --> 30:26.610
This new thing,

30:26.700 --> 30:28.817
that's not why you write.

30:31.079 --> 30:33.537
It's all the work I've done,
I don't wanna see it wasted...

30:33.623 --> 30:35.831
But it's not you.

30:36.960 --> 30:39.498
You wanna write your real book,
write it.

30:40.464 --> 30:41.830
It'll be great.

30:43.383 --> 30:45.545
I probably won't read it,
but it'll be beautiful.

30:49.014 --> 30:50.596
And I think that...

30:53.101 --> 30:55.434
I think maybe I should quit.

30:56.813 --> 30:58.145
You should, too.

30:59.524 --> 31:01.766
I walk away, you walk away.

31:05.113 --> 31:08.197
And let's put this thing down.
It's not ours.

31:09.618 --> 31:14.158
And like you said,
we're past the beginning.

31:15.165 --> 31:16.952
You could really quit?

31:17.042 --> 31:18.624
We'll both, together.

31:19.503 --> 31:23.588
You go and write the books
you wanna write, and I'm gonna...

31:26.510 --> 31:27.750
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

31:30.138 --> 31:32.050
But the smartest person I know

31:32.724 --> 31:35.512
told me I'd be good
at almost anything.

32:12.764 --> 32:14.221
Get outta here.

32:37.622 --> 32:38.783
What...

32:51.303 --> 32:52.794
Come here, buddy.

33:12.407 --> 33:15.241
<i>Old gal I knew still works at the DMV</i>

33:15.327 --> 33:17.660
<i>helped us out with an address.</i>

33:18.330 --> 33:19.571
<i>Junius Watts.</i>

34:19.431 --> 34:22.049
Here, chick, chick, chick.

34:22.393 --> 34:24.476
Might be less crazy than I thought.

34:25.897 --> 34:27.603
Don't get carried away.

34:28.149 --> 34:29.764
Here, chick, chick, chick.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.143
Here, chick, chick.

35:00.348 --> 35:01.509
Hmm.

35:03.435 --> 35:06.519
I been waiting on you all.

35:08.898 --> 35:10.935
Since the night you saw my car.

35:13.194 --> 35:15.277
Probably shouldn't'a drove off,

35:16.489 --> 35:19.232
but you had that baseball bat.

35:28.209 --> 35:29.666
Y'all here to kill me?

35:30.003 --> 35:31.619
Walk back in the house.

35:41.348 --> 35:42.634
This is you.

35:42.724 --> 35:44.841
Usually if PD or state
want a statement,

35:44.934 --> 35:46.470
they'll just drop it by.

35:46.561 --> 35:49.929
If we get an information request,
then we'll just connect it to you.

35:50.857 --> 35:52.098
You all set, hon?

35:53.443 --> 35:54.684
Yes, ma'am. Thank you.

36:26.976 --> 36:29.593
I worked with Mr. Hoyt
on his first chicken farm.

36:30.438 --> 36:32.225
Been there since he started.

36:33.525 --> 36:36.814
Lost the eye in a line accident,
one of the hooks.

36:37.237 --> 36:40.901
That ain't the part of your history
we interested in.

36:42.075 --> 36:43.611
I was saying.

36:45.245 --> 36:46.861
After he expands,

36:47.205 --> 36:49.242
he moves me to his place,

36:49.999 --> 36:52.537
I start managing
his household for him.

36:52.794 --> 36:56.037
Him and Miss Ellen, they had Isabel.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.207
Miss Ellen got sick.

37:00.760 --> 37:03.173
I helped him
raise his daughter.

37:03.972 --> 37:06.806
Isabel. She was a delight.

37:08.727 --> 37:11.765
She go to university
and meets a young man,

37:11.896 --> 37:14.058
and they have
a little baby girl. Mary.

37:15.108 --> 37:18.476
They was happy. Mr. Hoyt, he happy.

37:20.071 --> 37:23.439
Then there was the accident.

37:23.783 --> 37:26.776
Her husband and her daughter
skidded off a mountain

37:26.870 --> 37:29.613
on their way to meet her
at Bull Shoals.

37:30.248 --> 37:33.741
She gets very, very sad.
Worse than sad.

37:34.544 --> 37:36.752
Won't talk, won't leave the house.

37:37.589 --> 37:40.332
Has to take medicine. Lithium.

37:41.760 --> 37:45.754
This little girl I helped raise
was so sad she can't talk.

37:47.265 --> 37:50.258
Mr. Hoyt, he can't stand
seeing her this way,

37:50.602 --> 37:53.390
so he starts traveling again.

37:53.855 --> 37:57.690
Then one night, she snuck off from me.

37:57.984 --> 38:00.772
Took her car and smashed it all up.

38:01.321 --> 38:05.656
This patrolman, Harris James,
he help us keep it quiet.

38:06.618 --> 38:09.201
And for the first time
in almost three years,

38:09.287 --> 38:10.698
something stirs her.

38:11.372 --> 38:13.614
Employee picnic, '79.

38:13.833 --> 38:17.201
<i>She sees this family there
with this little girl, and...</i>

38:18.463 --> 38:19.544
- Mary!
<i>- ...she runs out</i>

38:19.672 --> 38:20.788
<i>and tries to grab her.</i>

38:21.257 --> 38:22.668
Hmm.

38:22.759 --> 38:26.719
Miss Isabel, she keep talking
about that girl she saw.

38:27.305 --> 38:29.217
Saying she's just like Mary.

38:29.474 --> 38:31.591
Says she wanna see her again.

38:32.060 --> 38:36.646
So, I take the mother Lucy aside,
back when she worked on the line,

38:36.731 --> 38:39.474
and I talked to her
about maybe letting Miss Isabel

38:39.567 --> 38:40.899
play with her daughter a bit.

38:41.611 --> 38:42.977
She was good with that?

38:43.071 --> 38:46.155
Well, she say okay,
but she want money.

38:46.783 --> 38:48.945
And she wanted
the little girl's brother along,

38:49.035 --> 38:50.492
keep an eye on her.

38:51.162 --> 38:52.573
And that was okay.

38:53.081 --> 38:57.041
Well, for a little while we meet them,
a little spot in the woods,

38:57.836 --> 38:59.748
and we just played.

38:59.838 --> 39:03.752
And Miss Isabel,
she get back to being her old self.

39:04.092 --> 39:05.674
Except what?

39:06.386 --> 39:08.548
Well, we had an idea.

39:09.138 --> 39:10.925
Miss Isabel wanna adopt the girl.

39:11.391 --> 39:13.348
She have a better life, we thought,

39:14.435 --> 39:17.269
and, well, the father, we'd just
have to figure something out,

39:20.441 --> 39:23.934
but Miss Isabel, she confused.

39:24.112 --> 39:27.446
<i>She'd stopped taking her medicine,
I didn't know.</i>

39:27.615 --> 39:30.403
<i>She'd been calling the girl "Mary"
since we arrive.</i>

39:30.493 --> 39:34.112
<i>I heard it. I oughta knowed
something was too wrong.</i>

39:34.664 --> 39:37.372
Well, we's playing hide-and-seek,

39:37.584 --> 39:39.416
<i>- and Will was off looking for us.</i>
- Will!

39:39.794 --> 39:40.830
Julie!

39:41.212 --> 39:43.044
<i>I guess Miss Isabel
had other plans.</i>

39:43.131 --> 39:44.542
We have to go home.

39:44.841 --> 39:46.332
No. Mary...

39:52.682 --> 39:55.390
<i>I told the girl
her brother okay.</i>

39:55.476 --> 39:57.889
<i>He just bump his head, that's all,</i>

39:58.187 --> 39:59.849
<i>and he'd wake up soon.</i>

40:01.441 --> 40:03.728
But she said we can't leave him there.

40:04.110 --> 40:05.601
And she can't calm down.

40:06.905 --> 40:09.272
<i>So, I brought him up to the cave.</i>

40:14.203 --> 40:17.196
<i>It was just...
Just a bad accident.</i>

40:17.916 --> 40:21.500
<i>Mr. Hoyt, he don't know none of this,
'cause he on safari.</i>

40:22.462 --> 40:27.207
So, I call the man Harris James,
he help us out before.

40:27.675 --> 40:30.088
<i>When that Woodard man went crazy,</i>

40:30.178 --> 40:34.513
<i>Harris brought that boy's backpack
up to his place, and the girl's shirt.</i>

40:37.602 --> 40:39.093
What about the mother?

40:39.854 --> 40:40.935
Lucy.

40:41.856 --> 40:43.313
Harris talked to her.

40:43.942 --> 40:46.150
<i>Explained things, the accident.</i>

40:46.736 --> 40:48.477
<i>Offered her a lot of money.</i>

40:49.072 --> 40:51.610
<i>Showed her the best thing
was for her to take it</i>

40:51.699 --> 40:55.693
<i>and let Miss Isabel have Julie,
just like we talked about.</i>

40:55.995 --> 40:58.658
<i>Only, itjust happened this way.</i>

41:01.501 --> 41:03.788
<i>The little one, Julie.</i>

41:03.878 --> 41:06.837
<i>Time we get home,
she calm with everything, no trouble.</i>

41:07.882 --> 41:09.965
<i>She happy to be there.</i>

41:10.259 --> 41:12.876
<i>I mean, we seen the girl is happy.
She is.</i>

41:13.096 --> 41:14.096
How's the castle?

41:14.180 --> 41:17.173
<i>And for a time, it was working.
Couple of years.</i>

41:17.266 --> 41:18.266
Good.

41:18.351 --> 41:20.764
<i>The little one,
she thinks she's Isabel's daughter,</i>

41:20.853 --> 41:23.516
<i>'cause Isabel's
been telling her stories.</i>

41:24.607 --> 41:27.896
<i>I'm just trying to take care of them
best I can.</i>

41:28.569 --> 41:32.358
I swear, the little one was happy.
I thought she was happy.

41:34.158 --> 41:37.026
<i>I didn't realize till later
what'd been going on.</i>

41:39.789 --> 41:43.373
She'd been feeding that little girl
lithium since she was 10.

41:44.043 --> 41:45.955
That was why the girl
didn't have no problems

41:46.045 --> 41:47.957
once we left Devil's Den.

41:48.047 --> 41:49.538
Must've started then.

41:49.674 --> 41:52.838
That's why she wasn't sure
about her own history.

41:53.344 --> 41:55.427
She'd been drugged half her life.

41:56.139 --> 41:59.257
Told some fucked-up fairy tale
by this woman.

42:00.435 --> 42:03.428
And Miss Isabel
was getting sicker and sicker.

42:04.272 --> 42:06.639
The girl is getting
more and more confused.

42:06.858 --> 42:08.770
Then she growed up.
She wants to leave.

42:08.860 --> 42:12.570
She asks questions,
her memories, her brother.

42:12.655 --> 42:14.112
I wanna help her.

42:14.615 --> 42:16.231
You helped her run away.

42:17.160 --> 42:18.160
Yeah.

42:19.662 --> 42:24.748
<i>I make sure that the door is unlocked
and Miss Isabel was in her bath.</i>

42:25.334 --> 42:29.123
<i>And I gave her a map
how to get to a place I had nearby.</i>

42:33.468 --> 42:34.675
<i>But she never showed.</i>

42:36.179 --> 42:40.549
And I was looking for her ever since,
trying to save what I could.

42:40.850 --> 42:46.096
That's real heroic of you,
you cyclops motherfucker.

42:46.647 --> 42:48.809
What happened to Isabel?

42:50.359 --> 42:52.021
After the girl run off,

42:54.322 --> 42:55.904
she had another break.

42:57.408 --> 42:59.741
She put on her wedding dress,

43:01.037 --> 43:03.245
she took all her pills,

43:04.624 --> 43:09.415
she go to sleep and never wakes up.

43:11.005 --> 43:13.088
Did you ever find her?

43:17.261 --> 43:19.048
'97.

43:19.889 --> 43:23.473
<i>I'd been passing
Julie's picture around for 10 years.</i>

43:24.560 --> 43:27.928
<i>This runaway girl
tells me about this shelter</i>

43:28.022 --> 43:30.139
<i>nuns in Fort Smith run.</i>

43:31.400 --> 43:34.564
<i>The girl says she saw Julie
working there at the convent,</i>

43:35.530 --> 43:39.399
<i>and they say her name is Mary,
which I knew it must be her.</i>

43:39.617 --> 43:41.028
Mary July.

43:41.744 --> 43:43.610
"Like summertime," she said.

43:45.164 --> 43:46.951
She didn't have any ID.

43:50.044 --> 43:52.502
She stayed for three-and-a-half years.

43:52.964 --> 43:56.503
First getting help,
then helping others.

43:58.553 --> 44:01.387
She'd been in bad shape
when she arrived.

44:01.639 --> 44:04.677
She had what's known
as disassociation issues.

44:06.477 --> 44:08.639
I believe she found a home here.

44:09.689 --> 44:15.060
But her time outside,
things she'd done...

44:17.155 --> 44:20.944
She had HIV, it turned out.

44:25.872 --> 44:29.115
We took care of her in the infirmary
when she got sick.

44:30.585 --> 44:32.577
A few months, she was gone.

44:37.592 --> 44:39.049
I was too late.

44:43.306 --> 44:45.343
Something she'd done
out there on her own

44:45.433 --> 44:46.890
got her real sick.

44:49.854 --> 44:52.938
And I told her,
I told her that I would meet her.

44:53.191 --> 44:54.807
I drew her a map.

44:59.113 --> 45:00.604
But she wasn't there.

45:03.534 --> 45:05.742
It's always too late.

45:07.830 --> 45:09.116
Whatever we do.

45:10.666 --> 45:13.454
That's why I's sitting
outside your house.

45:15.254 --> 45:20.295
I was just trying to get up the nerve,
trying to tell you what happened.

45:22.470 --> 45:26.384
So, you can kill me or take me in.

45:28.434 --> 45:30.050
I want it.

45:39.570 --> 45:41.937
I don't wanna live with this no more.

45:46.035 --> 45:47.401
Take me in.

45:50.748 --> 45:53.536
We don't have the authority.

46:01.968 --> 46:03.755
You don't wanna live with it,

46:06.555 --> 46:08.387
fucking don't.

46:11.602 --> 46:12.968
Hey!

46:13.271 --> 46:14.978
Y'all come back here!

46:15.356 --> 46:17.143
Y'all punish me!

46:19.568 --> 46:21.184
I need y'all to punish me!

46:24.282 --> 46:25.693
<i>Y'all punish me!</i>

46:28.202 --> 46:30.410
Your name was Julie Purcell.

46:31.706 --> 46:34.915
I'm sorry
I didn't do a better job for you.

46:36.168 --> 46:38.535
I'm real, real sorry for that, miss.

46:41.132 --> 46:42.873
Failure was mine.

46:44.135 --> 46:46.092
You deserved better than this.

46:49.890 --> 46:51.301
Better than me.

47:10.536 --> 47:11.536
Oh!

47:12.288 --> 47:15.122
- Sorry, mister.
- There you are.

47:15.958 --> 47:18.917
All right, that's enough
running around, Lucy.

47:19.587 --> 47:21.704
Why don't you go ahead
and jump in the truck.

47:21.797 --> 47:22.878
Okay.

47:24.175 --> 47:25.175
I'm sorry about that.

47:25.259 --> 47:27.922
- She likes to run around.
- No problem.

47:29.221 --> 47:31.087
You been taking care
of the place long?

47:31.182 --> 47:33.674
Oh, yeah. My dad started the business,

47:33.768 --> 47:36.385
and he used to
do the convent for free.

47:36.479 --> 47:38.516
I kept doing the same.

47:38.773 --> 47:40.264
That's nice of you.

47:41.734 --> 47:42.850
Y'all have a good day.

47:44.153 --> 47:46.520
Thank you, sir. You, too.

47:47.406 --> 47:49.614
All right, Lucy,
let's get your seat belt on.

48:05.633 --> 48:06.919
That's enough.

48:09.095 --> 48:10.711
I'll get the rest tomorrow.

48:11.722 --> 48:12.722
Yeah.

48:19.271 --> 48:22.810
I ought to throw it out now,
but it's all hers.

48:26.987 --> 48:29.104
Maybe we'll write a book about it.

48:30.366 --> 48:33.700
Have to keep starting over.

48:35.287 --> 48:37.370
We got an ending, I guess.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.081
But I don't...

48:42.461 --> 48:43.461
Hmm.

48:45.881 --> 48:48.624
Do you feel like any kinda closure?

48:49.135 --> 48:50.467
I don't.

48:52.805 --> 48:54.046
Me neither.

48:57.685 --> 48:59.267
Talking to your boy.

49:00.312 --> 49:02.770
I's been wanting
to get closer to town,

49:03.816 --> 49:05.352
and we were thinking...

49:07.945 --> 49:11.985
How'd you feel, me crashing here
with you a few nights a week?

49:16.370 --> 49:17.736
I guess so.

49:19.999 --> 49:23.083
I keep a neat house, though.
Just saying.

49:23.169 --> 49:25.912
I'll keep the dogs out back.

49:29.133 --> 49:30.374
Hey.

49:31.427 --> 49:33.635
Your little girl's
coming here tomorrow.

49:33.721 --> 49:36.384
Oh. That's right. I remember.

49:41.353 --> 49:43.686
Henry mentioned
you're all having dinner.

49:44.064 --> 49:45.475
Invited me over.

49:46.066 --> 49:48.604
Good. You should come.

49:48.986 --> 49:50.227
Okay.

49:53.741 --> 49:55.983
You be all right tonight, buddy?

49:58.037 --> 50:01.030
I'm good, brother. I'm good.

50:01.457 --> 50:02.573
Okay.

50:59.974 --> 51:01.556
Hi.

51:04.353 --> 51:07.471
Hey. Tell me what we're doing.

51:07.815 --> 51:09.602
You're not talking to me,

51:10.109 --> 51:11.771
don't return my calls.

51:12.236 --> 51:13.898
We're playing games now?

51:13.988 --> 51:16.071
I don't play.

51:21.620 --> 51:23.327
Is this about what I wrote?

51:25.583 --> 51:28.747
You read it. You encouraged me.

51:30.462 --> 51:32.795
What's going on with you?
What happened?

51:38.053 --> 51:39.885
Wait right here a minute.

52:04.121 --> 52:05.578
There's all your stuff.

52:08.626 --> 52:11.994
That's how you say "I don't think
we should see each other anymore"?

52:12.087 --> 52:13.919
What the hell is wrong with you?

52:14.256 --> 52:17.294
You don't like how I am,
get out of my house.

52:20.262 --> 52:22.879
All right, give it to me then.

52:22.973 --> 52:26.887
I want a clear picture
of who I've been spending time with.

52:27.353 --> 52:29.936
Clear picture is,
I don't wanna see you anymore.

52:32.274 --> 52:33.981
And I'm not the asshole here.

52:35.194 --> 52:36.776
You're the asshole.

52:38.155 --> 52:39.396
Me?

52:40.282 --> 52:42.114
- How?
- You used me.

52:42.534 --> 52:45.618
Fucking around with me so you could
hear what the police are doing,

52:45.704 --> 52:47.286
like you're better than me. Right?

52:47.915 --> 52:49.247
When I landed back in the States,

52:49.625 --> 52:52.288
some high yellow bitch like you
called me a baby killer.

52:54.588 --> 52:57.831
- I'm sorry that happened...
- Shit, you're whiter than my partner.

52:58.592 --> 52:59.708
Former partner.

52:59.885 --> 53:01.877
What's the matter with you?
What happened?

53:01.970 --> 53:03.586
I'm fucked's what happened!

53:04.223 --> 53:07.591
Twelve years on the job,
and I'm a fucking secretary now.

53:09.103 --> 53:11.937
So, you got in trouble.
What did they...

53:12.022 --> 53:13.513
Is that why you're doing this?

53:14.274 --> 53:17.563
I'm trying to pull my head out my ass,
regards to you. You...

53:17.820 --> 53:20.528
I don't know.
Maybe you didn't mean it all the way,

53:20.614 --> 53:23.527
maybe it just happened,
but you was working me.

53:23.617 --> 53:26.405
Always asking questions,
always talking about the case.

53:26.495 --> 53:28.223
That's not what I did.
You know that's not what I did.

53:28.247 --> 53:29.783
No, I don't!

53:31.834 --> 53:34.076
But I just about decided

53:35.087 --> 53:38.751
that you don't know what you're
really up to most of the time, do you?

53:40.134 --> 53:44.003
Being a good-looking woman
like you are, I mean.

53:44.346 --> 53:47.089
People don't really expect you
to take responsibility.

53:47.182 --> 53:48.969
You're just like a pretty bird,

53:49.059 --> 53:51.176
flying around,
shitting on people's heads.

53:51.270 --> 53:52.932
I don't need one of them.

53:53.439 --> 53:56.603
I was doing real good without
no head-shitting birds in here.

53:56.692 --> 53:58.228
You're a mean drunk.

53:59.695 --> 54:02.688
But it's good to see
how weak you really are.

54:04.533 --> 54:06.775
You've got a badge and a gun,

54:07.119 --> 54:11.204
couple of other things
that you learned from watching movies.

54:13.709 --> 54:15.701
But there's nothing here.

54:17.087 --> 54:18.087
Hmm.

54:21.341 --> 54:23.173
They wanted me to burn you down.

54:23.677 --> 54:26.044
Sign a statement
saying you were lying.

54:26.138 --> 54:30.257
That you took pieces of what you heard
and made up all that shit you wrote.

54:31.769 --> 54:33.226
You should.

54:34.480 --> 54:39.350
I don't want you in trouble.
I don't want anything from you, ever.

54:41.153 --> 54:42.985
Go ahead, sign their statement.

54:44.072 --> 54:46.234
I'm gonna be fine.

54:50.204 --> 54:51.661
I don't need the rest.

54:57.419 --> 54:58.819
I don't want this shit in my house!

55:55.894 --> 55:58.181
<i>Among the children
who knew her,</i>

55:58.730 --> 56:00.562
<i>a 10-year-old named Mike Ardoin</i>

56:00.649 --> 56:03.642
<i>seemed to take Julie's
disappearance hardest.</i>

56:04.152 --> 56:06.565
<i>I knew Mike
to be a shy, artistic boy,</i>

56:07.239 --> 56:11.108
<i>and he often played with Julie,
or at least sought out her company.</i>

56:11.994 --> 56:14.987
<i>His father ran a small
lawn servicing business,</i>

56:15.497 --> 56:16.954
<i>and when he spoke about Julie,</i>

56:17.040 --> 56:19.748
<i>the boy's lip trembled
and his eyes flooded.</i>

56:20.335 --> 56:23.328
<i>My attempts at comfort
were completely insufficient,</i>

56:23.589 --> 56:26.206
<i>but I tried to let him
talk about his feelings.</i>

56:26.550 --> 56:28.086
<i>He started crying.</i>

56:28.385 --> 56:32.174
<i>He said he always thought
he'd marry Julie when he grew up.</i>

56:45.611 --> 56:47.227
<i>"Tell me a story.</i>

56:50.532 --> 56:54.572
<i>"Make it a story of great distances
and starlight."</i>

56:54.953 --> 56:57.161
No. Please.

56:58.749 --> 56:59.865
Please.

57:00.959 --> 57:04.293
What if the ending
isn't really the ending at all?

57:15.891 --> 57:19.510
What if Julie did find a life
at that convent?

57:20.062 --> 57:21.974
Friendship, love.

57:22.522 --> 57:25.481
And what if that little boy
who loved her so much,

57:25.943 --> 57:29.152
that little boy whose daddy,
and later himself,

57:29.321 --> 57:31.688
took care of the yard at that convent?

57:33.283 --> 57:35.115
<i>What if he recognized her?</i>

57:36.119 --> 57:39.032
"'If you knew time as well as I do, '
said the Hatter,

57:39.498 --> 57:41.581
"'you wouldn't
talk about wasting it."'

57:42.668 --> 57:44.375
<i>What if he knew her</i>

57:45.629 --> 57:48.087
<i>even if she didn't know herself?</i>

57:53.095 --> 57:56.008
And what if those nuns
who cared about her,

57:56.848 --> 58:00.012
those women who knew
she'd had a hard life,

58:00.435 --> 58:03.143
they knew bad people
were looking for her.

58:03.772 --> 58:06.059
What if they wanted to protect her?

58:10.988 --> 58:12.320
Protect her how?

58:13.782 --> 58:15.273
The only way they could.

58:16.827 --> 58:18.568
<i>By telling a story.</i>

58:26.128 --> 58:27.369
And...

58:28.839 --> 58:30.080
And then...

58:30.882 --> 58:31.882
Oh!

58:32.676 --> 58:34.258
Sorry, mister.

58:34.886 --> 58:38.379
The little girl, that was her.

58:41.518 --> 58:44.135
Oh, my God.

58:45.355 --> 58:47.267
What if there's another story?

58:48.358 --> 58:51.317
What if something went unbroken?

58:54.698 --> 58:57.862
All this life, all this loss,

58:58.118 --> 59:02.453
what if it was really one long story
that just kept going and going

59:02.622 --> 59:04.909
until it healed itself?

59:06.168 --> 59:08.706
Wouldn't that be
a story worth telling?

59:10.005 --> 59:12.964
Wouldn't that be
a story worth hearing?

59:37.741 --> 59:38.902
<i>Information.</i>

59:39.201 --> 59:41.534
I need an address
for Northwest Arkansas.

59:43.955 --> 59:45.617
Mike Ardoin.

59:46.958 --> 59:48.244
That's, um...

59:51.088 --> 59:57.176
A-R-D-O-I-N.

59:57.552 --> 59:59.384
Ardoin Landscaping.

59:59.596 --> 01:00:01.212
<i>Just a moment.</i>

01:01:36.985 --> 01:01:39.523
<i>Pop, what's up?
I was about to come get you.</i>

01:01:44.409 --> 01:01:45.490
Henry,

01:01:48.788 --> 01:01:50.245
think I'm lost.

01:01:50.332 --> 01:01:52.494
<i>What do you mean? You on foot?</i>

01:01:55.754 --> 01:01:57.370
I'm in my car.

01:01:58.965 --> 01:02:01.298
I don't know where I am.
I don't recognize it.

01:02:02.344 --> 01:02:05.633
<i>Dad, Becca came in,
you were coming here for dinner.</i>

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:07.509
And I'm telling you,
I don't know where I am!

01:02:07.766 --> 01:02:09.803
Hey, hey, hey,
it's gonna be all right, Pop.

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:12.135
We'll come and get you.
Just take a beat.

01:02:14.439 --> 01:02:16.399
Is there someone around
you can ask where you are?

01:02:17.025 --> 01:02:18.857
<i>You see anybody around?</i>

01:02:28.745 --> 01:02:30.156
Mom.

01:02:36.628 --> 01:02:38.335
I'm sorry to bother you, miss.

01:02:43.051 --> 01:02:44.792
I have this, um...

01:02:47.305 --> 01:02:50.218
I'm sorry, I'm lost.

01:02:52.769 --> 01:02:54.761
Can you just tell me where I'm at?

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:59.815
Oh, of course. You're in Greenland.
This is Allegra Lane.

01:03:06.032 --> 01:03:08.319
Allegra Lane, in Greenland.

01:03:10.578 --> 01:03:14.413
House is 1208.

01:03:15.166 --> 01:03:17.123
Greenland?
What are you doing out there?

01:03:17.836 --> 01:03:19.122
I don't know. I...

01:03:20.714 --> 01:03:24.082
I was... I don't know.

01:03:24.342 --> 01:03:26.425
All right, it's okay.
Stay at your car, Dad.

01:03:26.511 --> 01:03:27.911
We're coming to get you, all right?

01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:29.671
<i>Keep your phone handy.</i>

01:03:29.848 --> 01:03:30.964
Okay.

01:03:31.933 --> 01:03:33.390
Thank you, son.

01:03:34.769 --> 01:03:35.850
Yeah...

01:03:36.938 --> 01:03:38.304
My son's coming to get me.

01:03:42.986 --> 01:03:46.104
I have this condition.
I forget things, and...

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:50.900
Thank you. Thanks for your help.

01:03:51.786 --> 01:03:54.119
Glad I was out here to help.

01:03:56.875 --> 01:04:00.289
Would you like some water or anything
while you wait for your son?

01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:07.504
Actually, if it truly
wouldn't be any trouble,

01:04:07.594 --> 01:04:10.382
I'd be grateful for some water.
Throat's dry.

01:04:12.015 --> 01:04:13.881
Lucy, will you get this man
some water, please?

01:04:13.975 --> 01:04:15.261
Yes, ma'am.

01:04:26.946 --> 01:04:28.278
Beautiful day, isn't it?

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:29.939
Yeah.

01:04:30.784 --> 01:04:31.945
Sure is.

01:04:36.247 --> 01:04:39.115
- Oh. Thank you, miss.
- You're welcome.

01:04:57.727 --> 01:05:01.971
Well, I'll let you get back to it.

01:05:04.359 --> 01:05:05.725
Thank you much.

01:05:06.111 --> 01:05:07.602
You're welcome, sir.

01:05:40.937 --> 01:05:42.144
Hey.

01:05:45.859 --> 01:05:47.316
- I'm sorry.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:05:48.528 --> 01:05:49.894
It's okay.

01:05:56.369 --> 01:05:57.701
Dad?

01:05:59.873 --> 01:06:01.205
Hey, Dad.

01:06:01.499 --> 01:06:02.499
Hey.

01:06:14.012 --> 01:06:15.628
It's different than I remember.

01:06:17.348 --> 01:06:19.510
I'm surprised. It feels different.

01:06:22.937 --> 01:06:24.644
Maybe you could stay longer.

01:06:26.149 --> 01:06:27.640
Maybe.

01:06:34.282 --> 01:06:35.944
Did I lose you?

01:06:38.036 --> 01:06:40.244
No. No, Dad.

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:41.821
How could you?

01:06:41.915 --> 01:06:42.996
I don't know.

01:06:44.375 --> 01:06:47.209
Seems like I'm losing
the hour and the day.

01:06:51.841 --> 01:06:53.423
I sure missed you.

01:06:56.221 --> 01:06:57.712
I miss you, too, Dad.

01:06:59.265 --> 01:07:01.097
I miss you right now.

01:07:04.521 --> 01:07:07.138
I haven't... I haven't really...

01:07:08.733 --> 01:07:10.019
I don't...

01:07:22.747 --> 01:07:24.204
Had this in my pocket.

01:07:25.124 --> 01:07:26.410
I don't know...

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:28.460
Dad,

01:07:30.129 --> 01:07:31.495
it's nothing.

01:07:33.299 --> 01:07:35.040
Go play with your grandkids, Pop.

01:07:44.936 --> 01:07:46.768
Sam, throw Pop-Pop the ball.

01:07:47.146 --> 01:07:48.387
Wait. Okay.

01:07:59.659 --> 01:08:01.275
Oh! He did!

01:08:01.369 --> 01:08:02.905
It's what you call
a slow break.

01:08:02.996 --> 01:08:04.862
Uh-oh.

01:08:05.999 --> 01:08:07.786
- What?
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

01:08:34.027 --> 01:08:35.234
You doing all right?

01:08:35.319 --> 01:08:37.357
Yeah, yeah, man, how are you?

01:08:37.822 --> 01:08:39.233
Still upright, baby.

01:08:40.992 --> 01:08:41.992
Real glad to see you.

01:08:42.827 --> 01:08:44.613
Glad to see you, too, pal.

01:08:45.246 --> 01:08:48.705
Mr. West, this is my wife, Heather.

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:50.657
- Hello.
- Welcome.

01:08:53.546 --> 01:08:55.127
Thank you, ma'am.

01:09:12.689 --> 01:09:13.930
Come on, hurry up!

01:09:14.024 --> 01:09:15.060
Come on!

01:09:17.111 --> 01:09:20.604
Hurry up! You better hurry up!

01:09:36.589 --> 01:09:37.709
Hey.

01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:53.470
Thank you.

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:09.161
This what you settled on
doing with yourself?

01:10:13.710 --> 01:10:16.953
I don't recall you mentioning time
in the armed forces.

01:10:19.716 --> 01:10:22.709
I don't let people talk to me
the way you did.

01:10:23.177 --> 01:10:25.840
A few women, no men at all.

01:10:28.266 --> 01:10:30.883
- Okay.
- I want you to understand that.

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:37.644
You don't strike me
as tolerant of that sort of behavior.

01:10:37.734 --> 01:10:38.734
No.

01:10:40.486 --> 01:10:42.694
That was the point, wasn't it?

01:10:48.619 --> 01:10:52.329
But I'm trying to remember that
a few weeks ago your friend was shot

01:10:52.415 --> 01:10:53.997
and you almost died.

01:11:03.342 --> 01:11:05.208
You want a do-over?

01:11:09.766 --> 01:11:12.304
I guess I wanna know if you meant it.

01:11:12.935 --> 01:11:14.767
If you meant what you said.

01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:21.483
I wanna know if you want us to stop.
That's all.

01:11:25.948 --> 01:11:27.564
I don't know.

01:11:29.494 --> 01:11:31.406
Wayne, what do you want?

01:11:32.497 --> 01:11:35.865
You wanna yell at me again?
You want me to yell at you?

01:11:39.003 --> 01:11:40.369
No.

01:11:43.216 --> 01:11:45.333
I'm sorry for what I said to you.

01:11:47.303 --> 01:11:49.340
I haven't been myself.

01:11:53.935 --> 01:11:55.597
You want me to leave?

01:12:01.818 --> 01:12:03.184
You want me to stay?

01:12:05.696 --> 01:12:06.812
I don't know.

01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:09.902
You're gonna have to decide.

01:12:12.119 --> 01:12:13.235
I...

01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:18.661
I'm not myself.

01:12:19.043 --> 01:12:21.251
I don't know. I don't like this.

01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:26.047
But I want...

01:12:29.136 --> 01:12:31.799
I think I wanna marry you.

01:12:34.016 --> 01:12:36.349
I didn't think that'd happen for me.

01:12:38.354 --> 01:12:42.564
I didn't let myself...
I didn't expect this.

01:12:44.235 --> 01:12:45.942
You.

01:12:51.909 --> 01:12:54.367
How would you make that happen?

01:12:56.831 --> 01:12:59.323
Guess I...

01:12:59.417 --> 01:13:00.897
Guess I should sober up, for a start.

01:13:01.836 --> 01:13:03.418
For a start, yeah.

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:12.927
I mean it.

01:13:16.058 --> 01:13:18.516
Then let's get you home.

01:13:24.984 --> 01:13:27.476
You can think about
how you're gonna propose.

01:13:31.824 --> 01:13:34.441
I can think about if I'm gonna accept.

01:13:39.123 --> 01:13:40.330
I'll do it.

01:13:41.709 --> 01:13:44.452
Get on my knees,
with a ring and everything.

01:13:46.964 --> 01:13:49.832
I ain't messing with you.
I don't play.

01:13:51.677 --> 01:13:53.418
No, I know you don't.
