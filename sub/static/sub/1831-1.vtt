00:19.340 --> 00:23.744
<i>The League of Nations thinks it can declare
an Arctic Free Zone, and problem solved.</i>

00:23.745 --> 00:25.328
<i>Well, it's been 4 years,</i>

00:25.329 --> 00:27.441
<i>and the big 5 are still
scratching and clawing</i>

00:27.442 --> 00:29.762
<i>for control of Arctic resource development,</i>

00:29.763 --> 00:32.473
<i>especially since China bought
its way into the argument.</i>

00:32.473 --> 00:35.096
<i>Anyone think last week's
ramming of a Danish frigate</i>

00:35.097 --> 00:37.340
<i>by a Russian nuke sub was an accident?</i>

00:37.341 --> 00:40.357
<i>No one's getting the last gas and
oil on the planet without a fight.</i>

00:40.358 --> 00:42.208
<i>Violence is bound to escalate,</i>

00:42.209 --> 00:46.037
<i>and as usual, Canada's Natural
Heritage Land is stuck in the middle.</i>

00:46.038 --> 00:49.427
<i>What we need is a League of Nations
here on the ground.</i>

00:49.428 --> 00:50.485
Off.

01:07.052 --> 01:08.713
<i>Now that the ice is gone,</i>

01:08.714 --> 01:11.150
<i>everyone wants a piece of the Arctic.</i>

01:11.765 --> 01:14.894
<i>Oil, gas, minerals, water.</i>

01:15.117 --> 01:17.935
<i>Everyone fighting for
their piece of the action.</i>

01:19.860 --> 01:23.617
<i>That's okay. I don't mind.
It's good for business.</i>

01:23.618 --> 01:27.091
<i>See, what really matters
is who got here first.</i>

01:28.526 --> 01:31.663
<i>And that would be me.</i>

01:33.994 --> 01:35.436
Would you listen to me, please, Vic?

01:35.437 --> 01:37.469
It's your place. You're the boss! So be it!

01:37.470 --> 01:38.949
Bettina, I just rent the space!

01:38.950 --> 01:42.264
This is your hotel, your bar. You
make these rules, so enforce them!

01:42.318 --> 01:45.721
Who else am I supposed to go to? We're
at the end of the freaking world here!

01:45.728 --> 01:48.543
You didn't get paid, too
bad. But I'm not your pimp.

01:49.152 --> 01:51.057
Fine! But I'm not the one who made the rule

01:51.058 --> 01:53.470
about not taking off rubbers in the ZipGrav!

01:54.770 --> 01:56.724
- He did
what?!! - Mm-hmm.

01:56.984 --> 01:59.373
- That goddamn little Brit!
- I told him Vic's gonna be mad.

01:59.374 --> 02:01.291
- I'm gonna kill him!
- He doesn't listen!

02:02.676 --> 02:04.634
There's a sign on the door
in 12 different languages!

02:04.635 --> 02:07.869
You're gonna make him pay, right? You eat
half a sandwich, you pay for whole thing.

02:07.870 --> 02:10.812
I told him Vic was gonna be mad,
but Clive, he doesn't listen to nobody.

02:10.812 --> 02:14.037
You want to run your business
in my place, fine, I don't complain.

02:14.038 --> 02:16.146
What are you talking about?
All you do is complain!

02:16.147 --> 02:18.373
- What? No, I don't!
- Yes, you do.

02:18.514 --> 02:20.838
- Where the hell is it?
- Look in your jacket.

02:20.839 --> 02:24.144
I'm only asking you to take part
of the responsibility for once.

02:24.145 --> 02:27.141
You bring these nut jobs in here,
I end up having to throw them out!

02:27.142 --> 02:29.148
I shouldn't have to clean up
after your clients, Bettina!

02:29.149 --> 02:30.088
Excuse me?

02:30.089 --> 02:32.042
You charge lots of money
for this anti-gravity,

02:32.043 --> 02:34.117
and I'm the one who brings
you all the business!

02:34.151 --> 02:35.820
You make all this money because I'm here.

02:35.821 --> 02:37.525
I should charge you for all
the customers I bring in!

02:37.526 --> 02:40.272
- What? You should charge me?
- That's right! I pay for my room!

02:40.273 --> 02:42.391
- Upkeep is for you!
- No no no no, you bring your clients

02:42.392 --> 02:44.897
in the ZipGrav. The responsibility's yours.

02:44.898 --> 02:46.716
That's why you brought the ZipGrav up here.

02:46.717 --> 02:49.048
It's for seasonal affective therapy!

02:49.049 --> 02:50.772
Oh, please! You installed a porno program,

02:50.773 --> 02:52.986
of course they wanna go in
there! It's not my fault!

02:52.987 --> 02:55.586
Look, there he is!

02:55.587 --> 02:59.251
You dirty little midget! Come on! Come...

03:03.267 --> 03:04.934
- Vic, whatever she told you.
- I warned you about this.

03:04.935 --> 03:07.373
- It's not my fault.
- See what happens to cheaters?

03:07.374 --> 03:12.047
You signed a contract before going in.
No spillage of fluids in the ZipGrav.

03:12.239 --> 03:14.539
- No spillage.
- That's right!

03:14.578 --> 03:16.322
- You're gonna clean it up.
- I'll clean it up.

03:16.357 --> 03:18.084
- And pay Bettina.
- And pay.

03:18.085 --> 03:19.347
Full price.

03:19.348 --> 03:20.594
You busy?

03:22.137 --> 03:23.284
Do I look busy?

03:23.285 --> 03:25.389
I'm not breathing...

03:25.424 --> 03:27.208
I got something to show you.

03:37.359 --> 03:40.446
So what's my surprise?
Caribou meat doubled in price?

03:40.447 --> 03:42.546
Found this on Natural Heritage Land.

03:47.301 --> 03:51.101
Looks kinda picked over. How'd he die?

03:51.102 --> 03:54.895
- Old age?
- Thank you, Doctor.

03:56.488 --> 03:57.886
You know who he is?

03:57.894 --> 04:00.562
Not from around here. No I.D.

04:03.320 --> 04:06.410
- Anybody see you bring him in?
- I knew you'd wanna keep this quiet.

04:06.811 --> 04:08.172
Yeah, you think?

04:09.675 --> 04:11.205
Let's get him inside.

04:20.903 --> 04:22.464
He kind of smells.

04:24.974 --> 04:26.378
I'll turn down the heat.

04:27.916 --> 04:30.041
Such a long term solution?

04:30.652 --> 04:33.379
No. I need to figure out who he is.

04:33.414 --> 04:35.427
What you need is an air freshener.

04:44.557 --> 04:46.624
- Hey, Vic, listen,you...
- You! Out of my bar!

04:46.625 --> 04:48.497
- No, you should definitely..
- You're banned.

04:48.498 --> 04:52.415
Don't ban me. Come on, please? I
cleaned everything up like you asked.

04:52.416 --> 04:53.739
It won't happen again.

04:53.740 --> 04:54.819
Out!

04:55.190 --> 04:57.141
I need the ZipGrav.

04:57.361 --> 04:59.664
I suffer from seasonal affective disorder.

05:00.045 --> 05:03.768
It's party of my addiction
transfer program. It's my lifeline.

05:03.975 --> 05:06.327
OK. OK.

05:06.428 --> 05:10.532
It's only that I came to tell you, as a
friend mind you, that you're needed outside.

05:10.944 --> 05:13.383
- Why?
- International incident at your front door.

05:13.384 --> 05:15.627
Guns, possible loss of life.

05:15.919 --> 05:18.600
- Seriously?
- You're gonna need your Customs jacket.

05:31.937 --> 05:34.342
Ms. Freemont, the dump
is International Free Zone...

05:34.343 --> 05:36.197
That cub wasn't at the dump.

05:36.627 --> 05:38.664
I've watched this cub
since he was 3 weeks old.

05:38.665 --> 05:40.609
He has a tracking chip I put on him myself.

05:40.610 --> 05:42.326
Hey, hey, what's going on?

05:42.327 --> 05:43.270
Vic, tell her.

05:43.271 --> 05:47.325
My men wouldn't go on Natural Heritage
land. They shot a bear at the dump.

05:47.326 --> 05:48.267
It's allowed.

05:48.268 --> 05:50.690
I've tracked this cub for the last 7 months.

05:50.691 --> 05:54.763
He was on his home range, and suddenly he's
moving at 60km an hour headed for the bar?

05:54.764 --> 05:56.625
You better put that down before you get hurt.

05:56.626 --> 05:58.491
Everyone should put everything down.

05:58.492 --> 06:02.269
You vodka retards killed this
bear on Natural Heritage Land.

06:02.270 --> 06:04.102
Clear violation of international Arctic

06:04.103 --> 06:06.093
- Vic, the woman is hysterical.
- protocol.

06:06.094 --> 06:08.106
What's the legality, Mr. Carboneau?

06:09.134 --> 06:13.450
At what point am I allowed to detain a
Russian criminal fleeing Canadian justice?

06:13.451 --> 06:16.659
Detain meaning dropping him with
80 grams of phenyl-bop-halo.

06:16.660 --> 06:17.713
OK.

06:18.507 --> 06:22.334
I can understand there was an unfortunate
accident where foreign visitors,

06:22.335 --> 06:24.427
maybe unaware of Natural
Heritage Land boundaries...

06:24.428 --> 06:26.233
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

06:26.293 --> 06:27.464
However,

06:27.465 --> 06:30.819
since the bear is clearly in
Canadian protectorate jurisdiction,

06:30.820 --> 06:32.173
I'll have to impound the bear.

06:32.174 --> 06:34.206
The fucking bear is ours!

06:38.199 --> 06:40.042
You're welcome to appeal, of course...

06:40.043 --> 06:43.208
But then I'll have to file a
section 17 Endangered Species Ap

06:43.209 --> 06:46.421
which can delay other Customs activities.

06:47.668 --> 06:48.695
They'll leave the bear.

06:48.696 --> 06:50.288
Yeah, I thought so.

06:52.016 --> 06:53.219
That's it?

06:53.402 --> 06:56.939
That's the penalty for killing
an endangered species? Vic!

07:07.153 --> 07:10.039
Really? You had to do that?

07:10.342 --> 07:11.533
Hey!

07:16.413 --> 07:19.705
You hurt my crew, you hurt me.

07:25.430 --> 07:27.144
Keep your crew in line.

07:27.407 --> 07:31.541
They don't like to be told how to
behave in International territory.

07:31.542 --> 07:35.144
Especially by a washed-up
cage fighter and barkeep.

07:35.872 --> 07:38.331
Customs officer.

07:39.858 --> 07:41.066
Anyway,

07:41.067 --> 07:43.824
International "opportunity"
zone but Canadian protectorate.

07:43.825 --> 07:46.987
Temporarily. Until the
Security Council rules.

07:47.132 --> 07:49.291
Well, who knows what the future holds, right?

07:49.292 --> 07:54.586
In the meantime, it's my signature that
you need to take anything in or out.

07:54.587 --> 07:57.846
I'm the rock this little venture rests on.

07:58.696 --> 07:59.908
So the bears

07:59.909 --> 08:03.575
get left alone, okay?

08:03.692 --> 08:06.194
Let's not be threatening and ridiculous.

08:07.626 --> 08:11.213
If I wanted to, I could shoot
everyone here and fly away.

08:14.112 --> 08:15.629
And leave all this?

08:15.984 --> 08:18.129
That'd be a terrible waste, wouldn't it?

08:24.442 --> 08:26.623
Yes. Yes, it would.

08:42.804 --> 08:44.160
You're welcome, by the way.

08:44.563 --> 08:46.063
I don't need help from you.

08:46.610 --> 08:48.685
No, you were doing great.

08:48.686 --> 08:52.724
Armed stand off, Russian boot on your
throat... You were what? In charge?

08:52.947 --> 08:54.326
You set a precedent!

08:54.327 --> 08:57.827
Now anyone can shoot an endangered animal
on protected land without consequences.

08:57.828 --> 08:59.331
At least I did something about it.

08:59.332 --> 09:00.950
Bit of an overreaction, don't you think?

09:00.951 --> 09:03.232
The Russian I shot gets to wake up tomorrow.

09:03.233 --> 09:04.837
My cub doesn't.

09:11.127 --> 09:12.610
What're you gonna do with him?

09:12.749 --> 09:15.236
Put him back so his mother
won't keep searching for him.

09:15.237 --> 09:18.252
I'll document the birds and animals
that feed on the carcass and

09:18.253 --> 09:19.938
then put the bones in storage.

09:24.446 --> 09:26.640
That hide's worth something in Moscow.

09:27.402 --> 09:28.966
They might come back for it.

09:29.088 --> 09:30.592
Yeah, I hope they do.

09:53.087 --> 09:54.244
<i>What is that?</i>

09:54.849 --> 09:57.919
Don't do that! Don't
override my "off" like that.

09:57.920 --> 10:00.974
<i>You don't answer your phone if I
don't. And I repeat, what is that?</i>

10:02.937 --> 10:04.794
It's a drunk. He needs to sleep it off.

10:04.795 --> 10:07.328
<i>I'm glad your alcohol poisoning
business is thriving, Vic,</i>

10:07.329 --> 10:09.926
<i>but can you explain to me how it's
possible that there's a shooting</i>

10:09.927 --> 10:13.446
<i>on the main street of Borealis -
overseen by you and I get the information</i>

10:13.447 --> 10:16.082
<i>from the Russian consulate?!
What do we pay you for?</i>

10:16.083 --> 10:18.363
Yeah, I was gonna call you about that.

10:18.364 --> 10:20.124
Too late. I called you.

10:21.641 --> 10:23.427
First up. Your "shooting"

10:23.428 --> 10:26.156
was a trank dart. There is no real harm done.

10:26.157 --> 10:28.920
<i>You're there to prevent
confrontations with the internationals!</i>

10:28.921 --> 10:33.153
The hothead nut job has
been put here by you guys!

10:34.027 --> 10:36.529
<i>Alison Freemont places herself, Vic.</i>

10:36.530 --> 10:39.624
<i>She's an internationally respected
biologist with a blog-cast that's seen</i>

10:39.625 --> 10:43.635
<i>in virtually every country in the world.
We can't stop her from saying what she says!</i>

10:43.636 --> 10:44.973
Fine then.

10:48.654 --> 10:51.665
<i>But we can try to control her activities,</i>

10:51.666 --> 10:53.818
<i>which is another of the jobs
you're not currently doing.</i>

10:53.819 --> 10:56.396
Control her how exactly?

10:56.397 --> 10:58.546
She shot a Russian in the ass!

10:58.547 --> 11:02.853
You want peaceful resource exploitation?
Find a way to get rid of her.

11:02.989 --> 11:06.567
<i>The government of Canada is not in
the getting rid of people business.</i>

11:06.632 --> 11:09.207
You should be, everyone else is.

11:13.929 --> 11:15.383
I hate this thing.

11:16.259 --> 11:17.641
Fucking hell.

11:50.233 --> 11:53.519
If you're a geologist, you're dead meat.

11:53.520 --> 11:58.013
Hey, you scared the crap out of me!
I thought I was alone out here.

11:58.014 --> 11:59.291
Is that so?

11:59.615 --> 12:03.642
To answer your question, I'm not a
geologist, OK? I'm an archaeologist.

12:03.643 --> 12:06.757
Really. You're American and
you're on National Heritage Land.

12:07.483 --> 12:09.293
I'm not inclined to believe you.

12:09.833 --> 12:13.513
Really. I care what you think because...?

12:16.200 --> 12:20.850
Look, the name's Dan Reardon. I'm a post
doc from Berkeley. I can show you my I.D.

12:21.333 --> 12:22.712
Keep walking.

12:24.392 --> 12:26.503
Look, I'm up here on a
research grant to look for

12:26.504 --> 12:29.371
remains of early 18th
century Russian habitations.

12:32.633 --> 12:33.780
Christ.

12:42.032 --> 12:43.992
S'posed to be ready yesterday!

12:43.993 --> 12:46.275
I pay extra for fast fucking turnaround!

12:46.276 --> 12:48.982
I had to fabricate a part. It takes longer.

12:48.983 --> 12:51.255
I could order new part from Beijing faster!

12:51.428 --> 12:52.719
Bring it over by boat!

12:52.720 --> 12:54.744
Hey, Roger,
since you're here, you got a minute?

12:54.745 --> 12:56.233
I dunno, Taq, do I got a minute?

12:56.234 --> 12:58.140
Do I got an hour? Twelve hour?

12:58.245 --> 13:00.885
Look, I need a doctor, and you're the
closest thing for a thousand miles.

13:00.886 --> 13:02.215
What? You got the clap?

13:02.216 --> 13:05.195
No. I got a situation, and I need discretion.

13:05.358 --> 13:07.289
Discretion will cost you.

13:07.548 --> 13:10.083
Everything costs me. Come on.

13:10.406 --> 13:11.782
What, you're coming too?

13:12.870 --> 13:14.432
Course you are.

13:15.495 --> 13:16.821
What do you think?

13:17.565 --> 13:20.051
Hmm, ruptured aorta,

13:21.871 --> 13:23.497
fractured skull,

13:23.498 --> 13:25.227
internal bleeding...

13:25.599 --> 13:27.706
Yeah, this one falls from a high place.

13:27.707 --> 13:29.399
He was on a plateau.

13:29.751 --> 13:32.091
You ever heard of aeronautics?

13:32.381 --> 13:35.026
Transportation device that go up in the air?

13:35.132 --> 13:36.683
You think he was dead
before he hit the ground?

13:36.684 --> 13:39.032
How am I supposed to know
this? I am psychic suddenly?

13:39.033 --> 13:41.376
I don't know, I was just asking.

13:41.814 --> 13:45.854
I finished my level 5 first aid.
I don't do autopsy.

13:47.919 --> 13:49.094
Here.

13:51.796 --> 13:53.452
What is this here?

13:56.395 --> 14:00.127
Who carries a 6-inch spike
in his long underwear?

14:10.779 --> 14:11.749
Now what?

14:13.199 --> 14:14.447
Try bending him.

14:14.646 --> 14:17.267
This is your plan? Really? Wait
till someone orders the special?

14:17.268 --> 14:19.392
Somebody airstreamed
this putz, whoever he is,

14:19.393 --> 14:21.717
which means someone's happy and
someone else is probably pissed.

14:21.718 --> 14:24.570
Till we know who's who,
and what it is they want...

14:24.571 --> 14:26.367
Well. What have we here?

14:30.339 --> 14:31.717
So many questions.

14:31.718 --> 14:34.473
Ramindar, you've been stationed here what,
six, seven months?

14:34.474 --> 14:36.244
Seven months and four days.

14:36.302 --> 14:38.519
I came with the first drill rigs 4 years ago.

14:39.610 --> 14:41.700
And I can tell you that accidents happen.

14:41.701 --> 14:43.015
Accidents.

14:43.394 --> 14:45.043
Misadventures,

14:45.044 --> 14:46.962
roughhousing gone wrong,
the occasional malicious

14:46.963 --> 14:48.753
score settling. It's part
of the charm of the place.

14:48.754 --> 14:51.696
Goes with last scraps for
oil and gas feeding frenzy.

14:51.697 --> 14:55.298
There you go. A self cleansing system
that's best left to do its good work.

14:55.299 --> 14:57.537
We're talking potential murder here.

14:57.772 --> 14:59.168
No! You think?

14:59.169 --> 15:00.899
- No.
- No way!

15:00.997 --> 15:03.981
People getting beaten to death
on Canadian soil provokes my mandate.

15:03.982 --> 15:06.552
Beaten to death?
We don't know that, do we?

15:06.553 --> 15:07.934
No, not really, no.

15:07.935 --> 15:10.724
- Look, a corpse found in the Free Zone
- Taq didn't find him in the Free Zone.

15:10.725 --> 15:13.440
Taq found him on Natural Heritage
Land, just Canadian territory.

15:13.441 --> 15:16.516
Well, Taq is a little shaky on the
exact location of the boundaries.

15:16.517 --> 15:18.352
As an indigenous Inuit
person I believe he can...

15:18.353 --> 15:20.380
Half Inuit. Only half.

15:20.381 --> 15:22.926
His father was an Irish mix from
Kentville or some such place.

15:22.927 --> 15:25.810
People with a notoriously
poor sense of direction.

15:25.825 --> 15:27.965
- Sorry, Taq. No offence.
- None taken.

15:27.966 --> 15:30.720
All I'm saying is the corpse
could've been found in the Free Zone.

15:30.721 --> 15:32.721
Yeah, yeah. It could've been.

15:32.722 --> 15:35.857
Look, the last thing the
government want is public perception

15:35.858 --> 15:38.979
that there are murderers
on the loose in Borealis.

15:38.992 --> 15:40.427
Guy's pretty battered.

15:41.613 --> 15:43.745
Wasn't that your previous occupation?

15:45.489 --> 15:46.953
Battering people?

15:46.977 --> 15:48.401
You can't be serious.

15:59.578 --> 16:01.030
Who is the deceased?

16:02.319 --> 16:03.954
Either one may answer.

16:05.156 --> 16:07.823
- Don't know. No I.D.
- Don't know. No I.D.

16:08.350 --> 16:09.945
Did either of you kill him?

16:09.950 --> 16:11.865
Not to the best of our knowledge.

16:13.004 --> 16:14.208
Mr. Quinn, do you agree?

16:14.209 --> 16:15.483
Not to the best of our knowledge.

16:15.484 --> 16:19.202
No. Do you agree with Mr. Carboneau
that neither of you killed him?

16:19.548 --> 16:22.756
Are you sure you don't want to
separate us so there's no collusion?

16:22.757 --> 16:25.409
- I believe I can recognize collusion.
- OK.

16:25.805 --> 16:28.169
For God's sake, Private,
that's a human being!

16:28.170 --> 16:29.345
Be careful.

16:29.982 --> 16:32.195
- Sure thing, boss.
- Lieutenant.

16:33.419 --> 16:35.385
Why were you trying to hide a corpse?

16:35.386 --> 16:38.028
We weren't.
We're just trying to keep it cold, lieutenant.

16:38.029 --> 16:39.633
That's what I was gonna say.

16:40.020 --> 16:42.392
- Is that collusion?
- I dunno, is it?

16:43.523 --> 16:45.120
May seem funny now,

16:45.659 --> 16:48.168
but when it's read back
to you in a courtroom...

16:55.004 --> 16:56.633
Oh. Bad news?

16:56.951 --> 17:00.696
Seems a senior government bureaucrat
has decided I should not be detaining you.

17:00.697 --> 17:02.879
- Oh, good then.
- Wow, look at the time.

17:02.880 --> 17:06.281
It's not over, Vic. I intend
to pursue my investigation.

17:06.281 --> 17:09.914
- Excellent. I'd like my spike back.
- If it's anyone's property,

17:09.915 --> 17:13.422
it's John Doe's. I'll keep it on his behalf.

17:27.390 --> 17:31.686
OK, there's some, you know, personal
information on there that's not really,

17:36.542 --> 17:37.920
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

17:37.923 --> 17:40.013
That's a single malt from
my own stock. You can't...

17:40.014 --> 17:41.588
Sit.

17:47.944 --> 17:49.683
This is a bad place to camp.

17:49.684 --> 17:51.762
I've pitched tents all over the world.

17:51.763 --> 17:54.791
I have bear repellent. Good camp habits.

17:55.270 --> 17:59.358
Try using bear repellent while Samantha's
licking out the inside of your skull.

18:00.982 --> 18:04.580
Twelve-year-old polar bear who just
lost her cub to some Russian rig-pigs.

18:07.404 --> 18:09.110
You won't even see her coming.

18:27.121 --> 18:30.046
- You can set up in the yard tonight.
- Outside?

18:30.119 --> 18:33.172
You're not getting my bed.
Tomorrow I'll take you to town.

18:33.173 --> 18:35.644
- What about the bear?
- I got a hi-freq grid.

18:35.645 --> 18:37.657
You're safe inside 100 meters.

18:41.447 --> 18:43.162
I recognize that from your blog.

18:44.959 --> 18:47.276
Free-Mountain Blog, exposing
corporate malfeasance,

18:47.277 --> 18:49.574
political ineptitude, media complicity.

18:49.641 --> 18:51.552
Required viewing for my students.

18:52.098 --> 18:53.917
You have students?

18:54.129 --> 18:55.881
Post doc comes with teaching requirements.

18:55.882 --> 18:58.732
And yes, many of my grad
students are older than me.

18:58.932 --> 19:02.803
Anyways, I'm a big fan.
Proud to sleep in your dirt.

19:05.081 --> 19:06.520
Can I offer you a drink later?

19:06.902 --> 19:09.023
It's really good scotch.

19:09.093 --> 19:11.448
I'm not concerned about
the quality of your scotch.

19:12.737 --> 19:14.670
I'm more concerned with who paid for it.

19:24.776 --> 19:26.025
You ever work?

19:26.398 --> 19:28.677
Yes, I work all the time.

19:29.703 --> 19:32.592
Vikings gave me 2 days off, but
it's not worth going anywhere.

19:33.854 --> 19:36.429
So, what happened to your addiction transfer?

19:36.689 --> 19:37.985
Hog all the weightlessness?

19:37.986 --> 19:42.183
It's not going so great.
I've got 2 addictions. Cheers.

19:42.705 --> 19:44.586
You patch things up with Bettina?

19:44.957 --> 19:46.539
She's still pissed off.

19:46.849 --> 19:48.110
I'm working on it.

19:48.111 --> 19:50.645
Hey, you uh...

19:51.404 --> 19:53.701
- You know this guy?
- He's looking poorly.

19:53.702 --> 19:55.618
- Viking?
- Not one I know.

19:56.240 --> 19:57.868
Can you find out for me?

19:57.879 --> 19:59.780
Free hour of ZipGrav in it for you.

19:59.781 --> 20:03.167
And I know it's not your strong suit,
but if you could be discreet?

20:03.168 --> 20:04.445
I'm your man!

20:04.446 --> 20:05.816
God.

20:15.766 --> 20:17.067
Alison?

20:22.494 --> 20:23.555
That her?

20:23.556 --> 20:24.706
Samantha?

20:26.033 --> 20:29.292
Look, can I come in? That
sounds a little unnerving.

20:30.511 --> 20:31.759
Close the door.

20:43.429 --> 20:46.625
- Who do you work for, Dan?
- I told you. USC at Berkeley.

20:48.340 --> 20:50.316
I turn off that barrier in the night

20:50.317 --> 20:53.130
and you're all hers. So
who's funding your research?

20:53.131 --> 20:55.116
Polar Expetroleum? Motron?

20:55.117 --> 20:56.983
Or maybe the Chinese are
recruiting abroad now.

20:56.984 --> 20:58.916
OK, it's true.

20:58.917 --> 21:01.289
Polar Ex is a significant
contributor to my university,

21:01.290 --> 21:03.862
but the work is still legitimately academic.

21:03.863 --> 21:06.864
So what do you do when you find
evidence of early Russian habitation?

21:06.865 --> 21:08.807
Bury it? Destroy it?

21:08.808 --> 21:11.686
Look, I can't do my work without funding.

21:11.884 --> 21:13.741
Polar Ex pays the bills.

21:15.781 --> 21:17.206
You know, just my luck the...

21:17.533 --> 21:20.775
the best possible result of
my best-funded project ever

21:21.790 --> 21:23.475
will be to find nothing.

21:24.802 --> 21:27.553
That's the first thing that you've
said that sounds like the truth.

21:30.477 --> 21:32.447
Well, welcome to Borealis.

21:33.831 --> 21:35.609
I came here to study wildlife.

21:35.610 --> 21:38.305
Instead I'm presiding
over the disappearance of

21:39.177 --> 21:41.036
one species after another.

21:46.077 --> 21:48.223
Don't make me go back out there.

21:48.852 --> 21:52.658
Ok, look, I will not move from my
office box, I promise you that, OK?

22:16.430 --> 22:19.019
<i>Carboneau's hanging in there,
but Murdock's younger and faster.</i>

22:19.020 --> 22:20.684
<i>There is some serious dark streak in that man</i>

22:20.685 --> 22:22.703
<i>and you do not want to
let him use those legs.</i>

22:22.704 --> 22:24.991
<i>Carboneau better get him
to the floor if he can.</i>

22:27.940 --> 22:31.261
<i>Ooh! Murdock catches Carboneau
with the knee and he goes down.</i>

22:31.262 --> 22:33.498
<i>He's hurt. He's hurt.</i>

22:33.499 --> 22:36.549
<i>Murdock follows up with a
devastating kick to the head!</i>

22:36.550 --> 22:41.177
<i>This is over. Carboneau's not mov...
Oh my god, he's not moving.</i>

22:46.886 --> 22:47.956
<i>Murdock follows up with a devastating
kick to the head! This is over.</i>

23:01.437 --> 23:02.512
Good morning.

23:03.496 --> 23:05.434
You feel like
making time-and-a-half?

23:06.837 --> 23:08.571
Let me finish my pancakes.

23:08.861 --> 23:11.031
Not me. Wasyl.

23:14.171 --> 23:15.902
Time and a half and you're paying?

23:16.962 --> 23:18.569
Why? You wanna watch?

23:20.146 --> 23:21.813
Here's what I need you to do.

23:26.225 --> 23:27.442
Vic! Vic

23:28.627 --> 23:30.172
What are you getting me into?

23:30.173 --> 23:31.855
I told you to be discreet, didn't I?

23:31.856 --> 23:34.653
It turns out Road kill's
a Norwegian archaeologist.

23:34.654 --> 23:39.310
Thorvald Sigurdsson. You didn't
mention he was tossed from a bird.

23:39.370 --> 23:41.082
Yeah. Slipped my mind.

23:41.083 --> 23:42.991
The Vikings don't even know yet.

23:43.266 --> 23:44.488
So what happened?

23:45.745 --> 23:46.808
Come here.

23:47.917 --> 23:50.362
The Norwegians have got their
own little history dig going on.

23:50.363 --> 23:53.786
Hoping to prove up claims to get
a bigger share of the gas pool.

23:53.787 --> 23:57.798
Thorvald's last seen heading to the
Russian dig site, and not seen alive again.

23:57.799 --> 24:00.848
- They don't report him missing?
- They think he's still out there...

24:00.864 --> 24:04.887
digging, I guess. They won't be
cool to hear the Russkies capped him.

24:05.266 --> 24:07.382
Russians? You sure about that?

24:07.383 --> 24:09.419
I know the pilot of the
bird that dropped him.

24:09.420 --> 24:11.740
Now everyone knows I've been asking around.

24:12.254 --> 24:13.988
The Vikings are gonna think
I had something to do with it,

24:13.989 --> 24:15.505
the Russians are gonna
think I ratted them out--

24:15.506 --> 24:16.742
Calm down, all right?

24:16.743 --> 24:19.440
I don't like this. I'm not asking
no more questions for you.

24:19.441 --> 24:22.204
It's gonna be fine. Relax.

24:22.659 --> 24:26.148
- An hour of ZipGrav coming to ya.
- And a fucking drink.

24:27.462 --> 24:28.847
And a drink.

24:35.679 --> 24:38.065
I need to go to the Russian
sector dig site. Wanna come?

24:38.066 --> 24:39.289
No.

24:42.017 --> 24:44.994
I could use a back up. I think Alexi
might still be pissed at me.

24:44.995 --> 24:48.098
For breaking his nose
in 3 places? I can't imagine why.

24:48.581 --> 24:51.288
- Please?
- I'm not in the bodyguard business.

24:51.296 --> 24:54.294
A favour then, to be repaid
at some point in the future.

24:54.295 --> 24:56.040
If you have one.

25:01.013 --> 25:04.899
I, uh... I had this weird dream last night.

25:05.654 --> 25:07.586
I'm wandering through the tundra,

25:08.240 --> 25:10.015
passing all these Inuit.

25:10.408 --> 25:12.634
But it was like it was some other time.

25:12.635 --> 25:14.992
Sealskin clothes and stuff.

25:15.047 --> 25:17.513
And no one'll look at me.

25:18.584 --> 25:21.445
They'll talk to me, but it's
like they're looking at my chest.

25:23.283 --> 25:24.795
You had the dream.

25:26.353 --> 25:27.509
What dream?

25:27.781 --> 25:29.613
The man with no head dream.

25:31.298 --> 25:33.239
Old story that people tell.

25:33.832 --> 25:36.535
About a thousand years ago they
found a man, European of some kind,

25:36.536 --> 25:39.021
wandering around the
stone house without a head.

25:39.222 --> 25:42.811
We ask him, what are you
looking for? But he can't answer.

25:44.905 --> 25:46.357
He has no head.

25:46.851 --> 25:48.213
So they leave him there.

25:48.214 --> 25:49.799
Place became known as...

25:53.938 --> 25:55.860
"House of the Man with No Head."

25:59.528 --> 26:01.880
You make up this shit just
to screw with me, don't you?

26:04.168 --> 26:05.323
Let's go.

26:10.626 --> 26:14.122
I was hoping to speak to you about
a recently discovered dead body.

26:14.396 --> 26:16.060
Foul play suspected.

26:16.061 --> 26:17.371
Suspected by who?

26:18.420 --> 26:19.583
By me.

26:20.337 --> 26:22.019
You're investigating a murder?

26:23.385 --> 26:24.652
Who found the body?

26:24.826 --> 26:27.327
- Carboneau.
- Vic?

26:27.328 --> 26:29.798
No, I don't think so. Taq maybe.

26:31.937 --> 26:35.757
Well, perhaps I could stop by your research
station as part of my investigation.

26:36.599 --> 26:38.022
I, uh...

26:38.023 --> 26:39.920
I often watch your blog

26:39.921 --> 26:42.517
and I think we have a lot in common.

26:44.913 --> 26:47.242
Extra room, so I'll move to town for a while.

26:47.243 --> 26:49.251
I should get my gear out of your vehicle.

26:49.407 --> 26:53.010
Dan, have you met Lieutenant Ramindar Singh?

27:22.973 --> 27:24.800
Where are you going, customs man?

27:24.827 --> 27:25.669
Are you lost?

27:25.670 --> 27:29.039
Hey, I like what you've done
with your nose. Very nice.

27:29.040 --> 27:31.371
- No, no, no.
- You're not in Canada anymore.

27:31.372 --> 27:34.829
Vic here is our first tourist.
We want him to come back.

27:34.830 --> 27:38.050
A tour. That sounds delightful.

27:38.056 --> 27:39.267
May I?

27:41.651 --> 27:47.157
For nearly 300 years, this lay undetected.
A Russian explorer presumed lost at sea.

27:47.639 --> 27:49.543
We have most of his remains.

27:49.699 --> 27:50.873
Most?

27:51.383 --> 27:52.865
All but the head.

27:56.412 --> 27:59.681
It will almost certainly settle our
national sovereignty claim in this area.

28:00.555 --> 28:04.177
You've ever heard of a Thorvald Sigurdsson?
Norwegian archaeologist?

28:04.178 --> 28:06.374
He fell outta one of your
choppers the other day.

28:07.434 --> 28:10.071
I'm sorry the Norwegian decided to jump.

28:10.176 --> 28:12.795
This climate affects some more than others.

28:12.796 --> 28:15.828
The pilot would confirm
that suicide, I suppose.

28:15.829 --> 28:17.523
If he were still with us, yes.

28:17.524 --> 28:19.941
He went back to Vladivostok yesterday.

28:20.865 --> 28:23.278
And your interest in this is what?

28:23.279 --> 28:26.008
Almost none. I would
just like to be reassured

28:26.009 --> 28:29.054
that this isn't gonna blossom
into some kind of turf war.

28:29.055 --> 28:30.679
Bad for everyone.

28:30.901 --> 28:33.359
No, certainly a dead issue from my perspective.

28:33.360 --> 28:36.505
So your headless fella here,
you sure he's Russian?

28:36.506 --> 28:39.033
Oh yes. Vladimir Constantinov.

28:39.068 --> 28:42.893
He claimed this territory for
the Russian empire in 1741.

28:42.938 --> 28:44.893
This is what brought Mr. Sigurdsson here.

28:44.894 --> 28:47.307
He believed that Constantinov
had retraced the steps

28:47.308 --> 28:49.363
of some Norwegians from previous centuries

28:49.364 --> 28:51.422
who had claimed the territory for themselves.

28:51.423 --> 28:54.473
But based on ironworks we've found,

28:54.474 --> 28:59.908
the Vikings Constantinov followed
were actually Russians from Novgorod.

28:59.909 --> 29:02.331
So either way, it's a Russian site.

29:02.332 --> 29:04.700
Maybe that's why Sigurdsson was so depressed.

29:04.902 --> 29:07.320
I wonder how your Russian lost his head.

29:08.057 --> 29:10.569
No doubt from asking too many questions.

29:23.114 --> 29:24.277
Any luck?

29:24.424 --> 29:26.562
If I had, I wouldn't be sat here, would I?

29:26.957 --> 29:28.542
Well, could be worse.

29:28.543 --> 29:31.356
You could be dumped out of a
helicopter on Heritage Land.

29:32.212 --> 29:33.728
How are they taking it?

29:33.729 --> 29:34.598
Who?

29:34.798 --> 29:37.608
- His mates.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

29:38.277 --> 29:40.493
There's no point trying to keep it a secret.

29:43.492 --> 29:45.626
The goofs at the army base know,

29:45.627 --> 29:48.105
so it's only a matter of
time till everyone finds out.

29:48.106 --> 29:51.527
The Vikings don't know yet, and they're
not gonna hear it from me, all right?

29:51.661 --> 29:54.635
I'm putting it out there
on my blog, so you're safe.

29:58.962 --> 30:00.469
Well, I shouldn't, but...

30:03.893 --> 30:05.547
Oh Christ, that's good.

30:05.581 --> 30:08.121
Research funded single malt.

30:15.562 --> 30:18.623
<i>As predicted, Borealis is
incrementally disintegrating</i>

30:18.624 --> 30:21.469
<i>into a lawless nest of thugs, rogues,</i>

30:21.470 --> 30:23.154
<i>and now maybe murderers.</i>

30:23.155 --> 30:26.980
<i>Norwegian scientist Thorvald Sigurdsson

30:27.013 --> 30:29.222

30:29.223 --> 30:31.853

30:31.854 --> 30:34.901
<i>- You gotta be kidding me.

30:34.902 --> 30:37.602

30:38.078 --> 30:42.143

30:42.144 --> 30:44.529
<i>for Canada's slender sovereignty claims,</i>

30:44.932 --> 30:47.086

31:02.548 --> 31:06.257
- Your spike. Just the usual.
- No problems?

31:07.134 --> 31:08.616
Vikings aren't going to like that.

31:08.617 --> 31:10.509
Yeah, I don't like it much myself.

31:11.780 --> 31:16.466
- Murdering Russians!
- No! Sven! No. Don't do it, buddy!

31:17.763 --> 31:20.368
Easy, easy. Come on, stop it.

31:20.369 --> 31:23.114
Stop struggling. Stop.

31:24.206 --> 31:26.172
You guys might wanna get the hell outta here.

31:26.233 --> 31:28.217
Finish your drinks and
get the fuck outta here!

31:28.218 --> 31:30.351
Now! Stop, come on.

31:30.352 --> 31:32.790
Come on. Easy, buddy. Stop struggling.

31:32.791 --> 31:34.175
Stop it.

31:35.331 --> 31:37.720
You good? You good?

31:38.075 --> 31:40.446
OK, buddy, come on. Come on.

31:41.417 --> 31:43.226
Someone's going to kill them.

31:43.444 --> 31:45.154
Maybe not me. But

31:45.996 --> 31:47.076
someone.

31:54.915 --> 31:56.059
Hey!

31:57.661 --> 31:58.785
Hey!

32:02.144 --> 32:04.435
You got any clue what you've done?

32:04.484 --> 32:08.022
Oh, don't act like you're trying
to preserve the peace in Borealis.

32:08.023 --> 32:11.668
- Piece of the action, more likely.
- You just started a war!

32:11.669 --> 32:13.509
Good. With any luck,

32:13.510 --> 32:17.474
the League of Nations will show up, stop
the drilling, and send you idiots home.

32:19.328 --> 32:20.894
You gotta be kidding me.

32:21.012 --> 32:22.461
Look, are you nuts?

32:22.462 --> 32:24.451
You don't go after the Russians alone!

32:24.452 --> 32:27.353
You have pissed off some dangerous people!
Do you not get this?

32:27.354 --> 32:31.384
Oh, I get it. I just happen to think
you're all equally dangerous and oblivious.

32:31.385 --> 32:32.592
Listen to me.

32:34.124 --> 32:36.663
These people answer to no one, okay?

32:36.664 --> 32:39.517
They don't care that you're famous
and loved by millions, all right?

32:39.518 --> 32:43.246
They will kill you in your sleep
and not ever think about it again.

32:44.392 --> 32:47.267
Anton intends to take over Borealis.
You wanna fight him, fine.

32:47.268 --> 32:48.309
Fight him smart.

32:48.310 --> 32:50.840
Nothing I said on my
blog was untrue. Nothing.

32:50.936 --> 32:53.769
I'm not saying it was untrue.
I'm saying it was indiscreet.

32:54.210 --> 32:57.842
Now we have a huge problem,
and you're right in the middle of it.

32:58.323 --> 33:00.388
Wake the hell up, OK!

33:18.920 --> 33:20.952
- Everyone's mad at me.
- Really?

33:21.199 --> 33:22.542
I wonder why.

33:23.550 --> 33:25.727
You spewed everything you
know to Alison Freemont,

33:25.728 --> 33:29.530
the one person who's most likely to
tell ten billion people worldwide.

33:29.561 --> 33:31.182
Stuff you were supposed to keep quiet for me!

33:31.183 --> 33:32.659
She already knew!

33:33.446 --> 33:34.832
Most of it anyway.

33:35.682 --> 33:38.809
The Vikings are mad,
the Russians are mad, you're mad...

33:39.120 --> 33:41.647
I can't go back to the
rigs till things calm down.

33:42.479 --> 33:43.695
I need a room.

33:43.784 --> 33:44.817
Please.

33:45.207 --> 33:46.262
You got me into this.

33:46.263 --> 33:47.891
You owe me that much.

33:49.370 --> 33:50.495
Give me 7.

33:52.380 --> 33:54.532
The Danes kinda trashed it, but it's empty.

33:54.768 --> 33:56.092
You're a good man, Vic.

33:57.156 --> 33:58.588
I won't forget this.

34:13.279 --> 34:14.746
That from the Russian dig?

34:15.429 --> 34:16.556
What's it to you?

34:19.350 --> 34:20.929
If you wanna know where it came from,

34:21.181 --> 34:23.110
foundry marks might tell you more.

34:24.034 --> 34:26.717
I have a bit of background
in this kind of thing.

34:26.902 --> 34:27.949
Really.

34:29.481 --> 34:31.830
I know you don't like coming
to town. Not that I blame you.

34:31.831 --> 34:34.516
Not the sort of community I'd hoped
to find when I was posted here.

34:34.516 --> 34:37.877
It's not a community, Ramindar,
it's a human refuse pile.

34:37.878 --> 34:39.292
What exactly can I do for you?

34:39.293 --> 34:42.724
Your rather public accusation
of criminal activity in Borealis

34:42.725 --> 34:46.293
leads me to believe that you know more
about the situation than you are sharing.

34:46.293 --> 34:48.521
- And...?
- And I think you should tell me

34:48.522 --> 34:51.315
what you know about the
murder of Thorvald Sigurdsson.

34:51.650 --> 34:53.358
I have been doing some investigating myself.

34:53.359 --> 34:55.574
In fact, I want you to look at something.

35:04.131 --> 35:07.231
You want me to look at
your stapler? No, I gotta go.

35:07.232 --> 35:09.047
Not my...

35:09.048 --> 35:12.050
Wait! I actually did have
a piece of evidence. I..

35:13.312 --> 35:14.468
Wasyl!

35:17.325 --> 35:19.494
Okay. Here's the match I was looking for.

35:19.519 --> 35:22.357
It was forged in the Holmgard ironworks,
now the Russian city of Novgorod,

35:22.358 --> 35:24.261
between 1000 and 1100 AD.

35:24.262 --> 35:26.135
So it really is a Russian spike.

35:26.824 --> 35:30.016
Amazing.
- Yes and no. Holmgard was a Viking town,

35:30.017 --> 35:33.182
settled on land that in later times
was absorbed by the Russian empire.

35:33.183 --> 35:36.384
Not made by people of, shall
we say, Russian descent.

35:37.196 --> 35:38.433
So how did it get here?

35:39.210 --> 35:41.396
It wasn't nailed in a Russian ship.

35:41.397 --> 35:43.077
It came in somebody's pocket.

35:44.840 --> 35:48.649
Last month, there was a robbery in a museum
in Oslo where Thorvald Sigurdsson worked.

35:50.790 --> 35:52.646
So you can prove that it's stolen.

35:53.380 --> 35:54.315
No.

35:54.316 --> 35:57.936
No, it'd be pretty tough, I mean, it
takes a lot of these things to make a ship.

35:58.517 --> 36:01.605
Once it's documented in the
archaeological site, it's legitimate.

36:01.606 --> 36:03.496
Ok, how many spikes were stolen?

36:03.766 --> 36:04.935
Six.

36:05.219 --> 36:08.817
Vic! Vic, you have to come
right away! Come, please!

36:08.818 --> 36:09.856
What?

36:28.820 --> 36:31.875
- Which one next?
- Anti immune RNA blocker. Yellow. Yellow!

36:33.220 --> 36:34.760
Have you ever seen this work?

36:34.761 --> 36:37.976
The nano beavers crave disruption in the
tissue. If he can be revived, they'll do it.

36:37.977 --> 36:40.796
- He was dead Ok.
- Hold that.

36:46.124 --> 36:47.844
- Put that there.
- He's breathing.

36:50.118 --> 36:52.280
Whoever did this thought it'd be
cute to snuff him in the ZipGrav,

36:52.281 --> 36:54.050
but it actually kept him from bleeding out.

36:56.561 --> 36:59.147
His brain might be shot,
but I guess we'll find out.

36:59.148 --> 37:00.691
It was the Russians did this.

37:00.692 --> 37:02.957
Alexi and Nicolai. I saw
them hanging around here.

37:03.547 --> 37:04.883
Keep the pressure on.

37:09.390 --> 37:10.647
We need to talk.

37:12.038 --> 37:14.949
I find myself needing to
remind my foreign guests

37:14.950 --> 37:18.143
of our little Canadian
sovereignty issue. Remember?

37:26.449 --> 37:29.091
I also really don't appreciate

37:29.092 --> 37:31.991
finding my friends
semi murdered on my premises.

37:36.342 --> 37:39.400
Clive violated the terms of his agreement.

37:39.995 --> 37:44.700
Sensitive information is of little value
if it's shared indiscriminately.

37:44.701 --> 37:47.102
- And Sigurdsson?
- He got greedy.

37:47.103 --> 37:49.273
Used the threat of "going
public" as his leverage.

37:49.274 --> 37:51.103
Mistaking this as public.

37:51.238 --> 37:53.510
You keep mistaking this as Russian.

37:53.650 --> 37:57.360
Please, Vic. I know you like to
think of this as Canadian territory,

37:57.361 --> 38:00.233
but I'm not paid to
embrace others' delusions.

38:00.234 --> 38:02.970
You have a reputation for
adapting to new circumstances.

38:02.971 --> 38:04.762
Feel free to start anytime.

38:05.172 --> 38:05.970
And if I don't?

38:05.971 --> 38:09.259
You end up like Clive. I'm sorry to be blunt,

38:09.260 --> 38:11.163
but this is the world we live in.

38:11.768 --> 38:13.269
You and I can work together,

38:13.270 --> 38:15.450
or you can leave.

38:15.451 --> 38:17.226
These are your options.

38:17.227 --> 38:19.947
No. No,

38:20.633 --> 38:22.424
I'm not going anywhere.

38:23.287 --> 38:25.738
This is my place. I built it.

38:25.739 --> 38:27.246
I own it. It's mine.

38:27.247 --> 38:30.497
And you are here because I allow you to stay.

38:30.498 --> 38:31.786
Understood?

38:32.690 --> 38:34.892
Now where's your other boy? Hm?

38:35.548 --> 38:37.813
The one who helped slit my friend's throat.

38:38.140 --> 38:39.859
I don't think I'll tell you.

38:40.879 --> 38:42.788
You know what, it's okay.

38:43.298 --> 38:45.745
I'll wait. Sooner or later,

38:45.746 --> 38:47.881
everybody comes to Vic's.

39:21.868 --> 39:23.608
Russians. Shit.

39:38.081 --> 39:39.888
I don't know why I care about him so much.

39:39.889 --> 39:41.630
He's just trouble all the time.

39:41.709 --> 39:43.737
I never saw anybody dead come back.

39:44.461 --> 39:45.939
How did you learn to do that?

39:47.105 --> 39:48.639
I had a good cutman.

39:49.408 --> 39:51.761
He gave me his kit when he left the business.

39:51.762 --> 39:53.978
Showed me how to use the nano-beavers.

39:57.216 --> 39:58.538
Did you ever kill a man

39:58.539 --> 40:00.668
when you were a famous fighter in Montreal?

40:02.575 --> 40:03.651
No.

40:05.446 --> 40:06.894
Did someone kill you?

40:07.909 --> 40:09.773
And you came back? Like Clive?

40:13.875 --> 40:16.833
Sometimes I see your hand
and it shakes a little.

40:17.674 --> 40:20.101
Yeah, well, there you go.

40:20.575 --> 40:22.073
Let me know if he wakes up.

40:22.560 --> 40:24.053
Why do you stay in this shit hole?

40:24.054 --> 40:27.491
You have the money to get out. You have
the citizenship to go where you want.

40:28.847 --> 40:30.220
Why do you stay here?

40:42.189 --> 40:43.966
I'm not sure what to do with this.

40:48.957 --> 40:51.669
Nicolai. He went back for the cub.

40:51.820 --> 40:54.083
- You did this?
- Don't be an idiot.

40:55.834 --> 40:59.172
- Where's his head?
- Found some skull fragments, bits of hair,

40:59.173 --> 41:00.680
but I didn't try to pick them all up.

41:00.681 --> 41:03.104
I'm guessing Samantha, you know...

41:03.105 --> 41:04.436
helped herself.

41:05.161 --> 41:06.224
Well.

41:06.225 --> 41:08.379
We could put him in the freezer, I guess.

41:12.590 --> 41:16.426
So, did I dream I was the headless Russian,
or was I the one without the head?

41:17.977 --> 41:20.096
Beats me. Your dream.

41:23.622 --> 41:24.756
Voilà!

41:26.117 --> 41:27.285
Nice.

41:27.946 --> 41:29.986
My mom was a soapstone carver.

41:31.546 --> 41:34.469
Is that so? I did not know that.

41:39.273 --> 41:40.599
Hey!

42:24.264 --> 42:26.622
- Good morning.
- Morning.

42:28.245 --> 42:31.485
There was an explosion
last night at the dig site.

42:31.865 --> 42:34.736
Really? You know, those
little compressed heaters

42:34.737 --> 42:36.606
are great unless they leak.

42:36.876 --> 42:38.846
The solar ones are much
safer, don't you think, Taq?

42:38.847 --> 42:40.941
Yeah. Not as warm, though.

42:40.942 --> 42:43.759
- True.
- You know, we inspected the debris

42:43.760 --> 42:47.755
very carefully, but for some reason the
only thing we could not find evidence of

42:47.756 --> 42:51.021
were the ship's nails we discovered.

42:51.128 --> 42:53.426
You'd think a fragment of
one of them would remain.

42:53.427 --> 42:54.809
You'd think.

42:55.434 --> 42:58.731
Well, I'm almost certain
they'll turn up somewhere.

42:58.915 --> 43:00.255
We can only hope.

43:00.293 --> 43:03.106
Oh, I don't know if you've
heard. The League of Nations

43:03.107 --> 43:05.825
has appointed a liaison officer to Borealis.

43:05.826 --> 43:07.560
Svetlana Virchou.

43:07.608 --> 43:09.009
New neighbours. Good.

43:09.010 --> 43:10.947
Yeah, I wondered when
they were gonna move in.

43:11.321 --> 43:14.764
I suppose all the recent commotion
has attracted the League's attention

43:14.765 --> 43:16.466
and they saw the need to put

43:16.467 --> 43:19.497
an international authority
figure here on the ground.

43:19.852 --> 43:21.386
Russian, by chance?

43:21.756 --> 43:23.013
I don't know.

43:23.909 --> 43:25.267
You'll have to ask her.

43:40.144 --> 43:41.692
This man should be dead.

43:42.844 --> 43:43.914
He was.

43:43.915 --> 43:47.227
You glued this sucker hooligan
back together for what reason?

43:47.228 --> 43:49.084
He was bleeding on my floor.

43:49.773 --> 43:54.182
What Anton causes to be dead, you
bring back to life at your own peril.

43:55.181 --> 43:57.286
He going to walk and talk again or what?

43:57.445 --> 44:00.273
If you're lucky, he will finish dying.

44:01.408 --> 44:03.490
If he lives, he could be a human turnip.

44:03.491 --> 44:05.369
Thank God you're not a real doctor.

44:06.035 --> 44:09.404
I'll spend my fee at your bar.
Tell Darion to start a new chit.

44:13.880 --> 44:16.954
No, I can't use Xanadu, it's a proper noun.

44:16.955 --> 44:19.202
- Taq, what are you doing?
- I'm playing Scrabble.

44:19.203 --> 44:21.137
Hey, do you know a word that starts with X?

44:27.377 --> 44:29.685
Well, this should be interesting.

44:38.996 --> 44:41.278
Vic Carboneau. Customs official.

44:41.433 --> 44:42.676
I also own this place.

44:42.677 --> 44:44.184
Svetlana Virchou,

44:44.185 --> 44:46.392
Special Envoy from the League of Nations.

44:46.393 --> 44:49.644
- I know. Can I get you a drink?
- Not at ten a.m.

44:49.645 --> 44:52.467
It's the Arctic. Day and night
aren't the same thing here.

44:53.517 --> 44:55.457
I wanted to introduce myself because I know

44:55.458 --> 44:58.026
what an influential figure
you are, here in Borealis.

44:58.027 --> 44:59.704
- Really.
- Customs official,

44:59.705 --> 45:02.101
air-strip owner, hotelier, supplier of goods

45:02.102 --> 45:03.535
to the international interests.

45:03.536 --> 45:05.619
- Here you go, Vic.
- Only legal ones, of course.

45:05.620 --> 45:06.760
Of course.

45:06.978 --> 45:11.012
I know, for example, you provide a setting
for lonely young rig workers... to meet...

45:11.482 --> 45:12.971
Shall we say new friends?

45:12.972 --> 45:15.394
- I'm sentimental that way...
- You sell them refreshments,

45:15.395 --> 45:17.169
introduce them to games of chance...

45:17.170 --> 45:19.062
Anything to make their
time here more pleasant.

45:19.063 --> 45:22.154
You wouldn't think it, but
you and I have a lot in common.

45:22.456 --> 45:23.897
- Do tell.
- You need harmony

45:23.898 --> 45:26.994
in the community and a balance
of political power to keep your

45:26.995 --> 45:30.525
philanthropic enterprises
functioning. And so do I.

45:30.526 --> 45:33.052
Exploiting the Earth's
last major oil and gas field

45:33.053 --> 45:36.002
is a competitive business. It
can lead to political tension.

45:36.003 --> 45:38.326
- I hate political tension.
- We all do.

45:39.643 --> 45:41.538
You may find this hard to
believe, but certain people

45:41.539 --> 45:43.897
have tried to get me to
leave my useful work here.

45:43.999 --> 45:45.349
- Shocking!
- I know.

45:45.350 --> 45:48.359
Luckily, I am not easily moved.

45:48.360 --> 45:52.682
Lucky for everyone. Yes, I think we'll
turn out to be great friends, you and I.

45:52.683 --> 45:53.912
I do hope so.

45:53.913 --> 45:57.020
In the meantime, let me know if there's
anything you need for your new quarters.

45:57.021 --> 45:59.317
Furnishings, restocked bar,

45:59.318 --> 46:02.771
small white envelopes with...
whatever you like.

46:03.136 --> 46:07.153
That won't be necessary.
I've come with all the necessities of life.

46:10.613 --> 46:11.882
What did she want?

46:12.022 --> 46:14.132
Nothing. She wants to be friends.

46:14.223 --> 46:16.042
Why would she want to be friends with you?

46:16.237 --> 46:18.242
Why would anyone want to be
friends with you, for that matter?

46:18.243 --> 46:19.370
Exactly.

46:20.108 --> 46:22.876
- What's the story here?
- Stuff came in for the Danes.

46:23.687 --> 46:24.956
Let's see what we got.

46:24.957 --> 46:29.358
Mudcat parts, mother boards,
frak shots, canned herring.

46:29.433 --> 46:31.148
Five cases of Aquavit.

46:31.568 --> 46:34.306
Four. Four cases of Aquavit.

46:34.456 --> 46:36.408
Four cases of Aquavit.

46:50.479 --> 46:51.733
What the hell are you doing?

46:52.454 --> 46:53.357
Ah, Bettina.

46:53.358 --> 46:54.727
I said, what are you doing?.

46:54.728 --> 46:56.611
My man here lost his scan key..

46:56.612 --> 46:59.123
If you touch Clive again,
somebody finishes you!

46:59.124 --> 47:00.935
Why are you telling me my business?

47:00.936 --> 47:03.357
Do I tell you yours? Do I say...

47:03.358 --> 47:06.649
A Chinese likes it this way,
a Norwegian like that?

47:07.107 --> 47:08.349
No, I don't.

47:08.477 --> 47:11.190
If Vic catches you here,
you are dead men, both of you!

47:11.191 --> 47:13.329
Watch someone doesn't boil you in a pot.

47:13.330 --> 47:14.677
What's going on here?

47:15.154 --> 47:17.290
I caught them try to break in.
They're going after Clive again.

47:17.291 --> 47:19.364
This bitch is hysterical.

47:20.368 --> 47:21.911
Watch your mouth.

47:22.271 --> 47:25.537
You don't touch Anton. I don't
care if the whore is your wife.

47:27.448 --> 47:29.777
Stop! Stop! Wasyl,
what the hell are you doing?

47:29.778 --> 47:31.744
They were going to attack
Clive, Bettina caught them.

47:31.745 --> 47:32.956
Going to?

47:32.957 --> 47:34.811
Your private here is a mind reader?

47:34.812 --> 47:35.835
Wasyl?

47:35.836 --> 47:37.552
They were disrespecting Bettina.

47:37.553 --> 47:38.904
So you punched him?

47:39.723 --> 47:41.835
Please, I'm sorry. I apologize
for my private's behavior--

47:41.836 --> 47:43.192
That is not good enough.

47:43.193 --> 47:45.042
- Now he's all offended...
- Shut up.

47:45.043 --> 47:46.862
Private Demchuk's
actions are inexcusable and--

47:46.863 --> 47:50.423
He sucker punched me! I'm launching a
formal complaint with the League of Nations.

47:50.424 --> 47:52.717
I was assaulted by a drunk Canadian soldier.

47:52.718 --> 47:53.880
I want satisfaction.

47:53.881 --> 47:55.395
You deserved it, you little twat.

47:55.396 --> 47:57.002
Private! Be quiet!

47:59.358 --> 48:01.826
You fight me fair, that's something else.

48:01.827 --> 48:02.810
Anytime.

48:02.811 --> 48:04.601
You have every right to
launch an official complaint,

48:04.602 --> 48:08.022
but I would ask that in everyone's interest,
you please accept an apology...

48:08.023 --> 48:10.452
I'm not apologizing to you. No way!
He should be apologizing to Bettina.

48:10.453 --> 48:14.189
Gentlemen, if the issue is
that the punch wasn't fair,

48:14.420 --> 48:16.169
then make it a fair fight.

48:16.476 --> 48:18.981
You bet.
I'll fight this little garden gnome anytime.

48:18.982 --> 48:20.589
No, no.

48:21.429 --> 48:23.630
I can't take responsibility
if your man gets injured.

48:23.631 --> 48:26.444
We'll make them sign off. Cage fight.

48:26.445 --> 48:29.443
It'll good for the town, people
like a little distraction...

48:29.444 --> 48:31.084
No. He's a soldier in my command.

48:31.085 --> 48:32.454
If he injures a civilian...

48:32.541 --> 48:35.408
It's either this or the L.O.N.

48:45.405 --> 48:47.321
Looks like you need lubricant.

48:49.903 --> 48:51.692
I've got aquavit.

48:51.707 --> 48:54.706
There are a dozen ways to tell me
you're coming. Don't just show up.

48:55.017 --> 48:59.183
- I'm old fashioned.
- No, you're not. You're strategic.

49:00.631 --> 49:01.751
Drink?

49:01.752 --> 49:04.279
Oh, another gift to customs?

49:05.344 --> 49:08.929
Sometimes, I don't understand
my own popularity. You got glasses?

49:13.702 --> 49:17.599
So, you met the new Special
Liaison from the League of Nations?

49:17.600 --> 49:19.580
Yeah, we've met.

49:19.581 --> 49:21.837
It's going to be a bright
new day for some of us.

49:21.838 --> 49:26.241
She follows my blog, she's
sensitive to environmental issues.

49:26.242 --> 49:30.253
You didn't fail to notice those heavily
armed lugs in red berets, did you?

49:30.633 --> 49:33.231
No more commercial incursion
into Natural Heritage Lands,

49:33.232 --> 49:36.076
no more drunk hunters shooting the place up.

49:36.577 --> 49:37.240
And you trust her?

49:37.241 --> 49:40.950
More than the idiot crowd of slobbering
greed heads I'm usually surrounded by.

49:41.897 --> 49:45.596
Actually, you're surrounded by marmots,
that aren't even indigenous.

49:47.278 --> 49:49.726
All right, you've made a
new friend, good for you.

49:49.727 --> 49:51.559
And not so good for you.

49:53.720 --> 49:55.050
Thanks for the drink,

49:55.257 --> 49:57.017
or maybe I should thank the Danes.

49:57.475 --> 49:58.927
Now, I've got work to do.

50:02.123 --> 50:02.934
I was...

50:02.935 --> 50:04.606
Zip it up on your way out.

50:04.729 --> 50:06.778
Yeah, okay.

50:22.281 --> 50:25.153
I brought you some food.
You need to eat something.

50:25.839 --> 50:27.926
Okay, some porridge.

50:28.325 --> 50:29.738
Not too hot.

50:29.861 --> 50:31.080
Come.

50:32.247 --> 50:34.996
Here, come on. Please.

50:37.148 --> 50:38.339
Chew.

50:38.428 --> 50:39.547
Good.

50:44.617 --> 50:48.528
You're so lucky. Not many men
come back from being dead as you.

50:48.529 --> 50:49.855
Stay.

50:53.928 --> 50:56.345
I told Vic you were going to be okay.

51:03.122 --> 51:04.958
Here, come on.

51:09.923 --> 51:11.762
Okay, so what were you thinking?

51:12.630 --> 51:15.119
Drunk on duty, undisciplined, slovenly.

51:15.120 --> 51:17.201
You're making us look like idiots.

51:17.371 --> 51:18.884
Lieutenant Singh?

51:23.971 --> 51:28.988
I am the de facto authority here but, of course,
with the international free zone definition

51:28.989 --> 51:30.848
phrased as loosely as it is...

51:30.849 --> 51:33.002
I see the position you're in, yes.

51:33.003 --> 51:35.207
I can investigate, but not arrest,

51:35.208 --> 51:37.419
inquire, but not prosecute.

51:38.617 --> 51:39.795
It's maddening.

51:39.796 --> 51:42.894
Someone with your obvious
talents... it's a waste.

51:42.895 --> 51:45.902
Do you know what our biggest problem is here?

51:46.655 --> 51:48.462
Vic Carboneau.

51:48.957 --> 51:51.287
He has some kind of government protection,

51:51.333 --> 51:53.527
otherwise I would have
had him arrested long ago.

51:53.528 --> 51:56.048
Whatever goes wrong in Borealis,
he's usually at the root of it.

51:56.049 --> 51:56.818
In what way?

51:56.819 --> 52:01.444
Graft, corruption, illegal
activities of all kinds.

52:01.598 --> 52:05.947
The Russians believe he stole some artifacts
from their archeological site recently,

52:06.059 --> 52:09.194
some ships' nails.

52:09.205 --> 52:10.675
The list goes on and on...

52:10.676 --> 52:15.627
A League of Nations presence in Borealis
can be a terrific resource for you, Ramindar.

52:16.018 --> 52:19.293
We have common goals,
order and public safety.

52:19.942 --> 52:21.427
If we work as a team,

52:21.562 --> 52:25.422
I see no reason why a posting like this
couldn't turn into a career win for you.

52:27.559 --> 52:29.647
- More tea?
- Please.

52:29.648 --> 52:33.364
Svetlana Virchou is clean.
No affiliations, no skeletons in the closet...

52:33.365 --> 52:36.869
Swiss or Austrian possibly... raised
in Argentina by diplomat parents.

52:36.870 --> 52:39.145
I rolled out the welcome carpet,
there was no uptake.

52:39.146 --> 52:41.253
Someone else has to be paying her.

52:41.296 --> 52:43.625
You've got a dark and suspicious
turn of mind, Vic.

52:43.626 --> 52:44.894
I learned it from you, ma'am.

52:44.895 --> 52:46.319
Maybe she's actually what she says she is.

52:46.320 --> 52:50.439
No, no. Everybody comes to Borealis to make
money, everybody! And I got no problem with that.

52:50.440 --> 52:53.041
I just wanna how she plans to do it
and how much it's going to cost me.

52:53.042 --> 52:54.745
This is not about your hobbies or side deals.

52:54.746 --> 52:58.827
L.O.N. presence in Borealis represents a
serious threat to our Arctic sovereignty.

52:59.435 --> 53:03.271
Look, can't you just make an official complaint
and have her replaced with someone you own?

53:03.272 --> 53:05.680
You're all we have up there,
so try not to get killed

53:05.681 --> 53:07.909
or arrested or otherwise
incapacitated, alright?

53:07.910 --> 53:09.722
Volkov is pushing the L.O.N. hard.

53:09.723 --> 53:11.243
If the Russians get the ruling they want,

53:11.244 --> 53:14.053
they'll have a stranglehold
on the world's oil supply.

53:14.646 --> 53:15.888
What is that sound?

53:16.621 --> 53:17.699
I don't know.

53:27.767 --> 53:29.552
What the fuck is going on?

53:30.420 --> 53:31.419
What is he on?

53:31.420 --> 53:33.263
I don't know, but I'm not gonna ask him.

53:33.264 --> 53:35.441
You are a true humanitarian, Taq.

53:35.442 --> 53:37.832
- He'll hurt himself!
- Somebody better do something.

53:37.833 --> 53:40.906
Come on, buddy. It's all right,
it's Vic! Hey! Hey! Hey!

53:44.880 --> 53:47.172
- I could use some help, here.
- I think you're doing great.

53:47.173 --> 53:49.122
What are you on? You're breaking my shit!

53:49.123 --> 53:51.095
Fuck that! Come on!

53:52.729 --> 53:54.227
Come on! Come on!

53:55.745 --> 53:58.741
Come on! That's right.

53:58.742 --> 54:00.431
What are you, nailed down or something?

54:00.432 --> 54:01.854
What's going on here?

54:04.732 --> 54:05.824
Nothing.

54:09.859 --> 54:14.313
Bataar is normally a pretty happy drunk,
especially on pay day.

54:15.968 --> 54:17.762
Any idea what's actually in his system?

54:17.763 --> 54:22.596
Blood reads clean. I don't know. Maybe...

54:22.597 --> 54:24.659
Maybe the ghost-meth-pogo.

54:25.080 --> 54:27.177
I've heard about "meth -pogo".
What's with the "ghost"?

54:27.178 --> 54:31.391
Ghost, it masks itself in the
blood for the first couple days.

54:31.392 --> 54:34.711
You can only find it
in trace elements after the full metabolism.

54:34.712 --> 54:36.973
This is how the rig-pigs beat the screen.

54:39.407 --> 54:41.307
Is he gonna be any calmer when he wakes up?

54:42.134 --> 54:45.477
- Depends on how much he took.
- I'll be outside.

55:05.505 --> 55:08.542
Ghost -meth is an
internationally banned substance.

55:09.164 --> 55:12.418
Its presence here should be very troubling
to you in your capacity as customs officer.

55:12.419 --> 55:14.763
It is. Deeply.

55:15.381 --> 55:16.995
I would hate to find out he got it from you.

55:16.996 --> 55:18.757
I would hate for you to find that out too.

55:19.517 --> 55:22.015
You have a quick temper, Mr. Carboneau.

55:22.446 --> 55:25.174
I found it useful in my previous occupation.

55:25.417 --> 55:27.636
But those days are over. Aren't they?

55:37.265 --> 55:38.904
I think she likes you.

55:41.641 --> 55:44.419
How should I set the odds?
Bunch of guys want in on this.

55:44.420 --> 55:45.479
What're you talking about?

55:45.480 --> 55:47.631
Wasyl against the new Russian in the cage.

55:47.632 --> 55:51.050
Five to one is generous...
Wasyl is a heavy favourite.

55:51.110 --> 55:53.620
Wasyl? Why the hell doesn't
anybody tell me anything around here?

55:53.621 --> 55:54.896
What new Russian?

55:55.749 --> 55:57.476
Sergei something or another.

55:59.922 --> 56:01.175
Sergei?

56:08.190 --> 56:09.383
Hello, Anton.

56:11.069 --> 56:14.004
You're new here, right? I'm Vic Carboneau.

56:14.030 --> 56:15.402
I own this place.

56:16.437 --> 56:18.148
Care to join us, Vic?

56:18.430 --> 56:20.272
There's a new drug in town, Anton.

56:20.273 --> 56:21.520
Really?

56:21.521 --> 56:26.041
And because Sergei here is new, he may
not know the rules about drugs in Borealis.

56:28.317 --> 56:33.036
We love them. Recreational whatever,
booze of all kinds, it's all good fun.

56:33.037 --> 56:35.742
I don't even take a piece of the action,
I just collect a small tax

56:35.743 --> 56:37.791
for the government of Canada, that's it.

56:38.493 --> 56:39.581
Except

56:40.153 --> 56:43.753
for drugs that cause people to go
berserk on themselves or others.

56:43.754 --> 56:45.717
That's a non starter around here.

56:46.258 --> 56:48.875
Like the fucking crap the Mongolian took.

56:48.876 --> 56:50.370
We don't take that.

56:51.294 --> 56:52.852
Drugs like this are...

56:52.989 --> 56:55.265
a destabilizing influence.

56:55.392 --> 56:58.269
The new L.O.N. presence might be signaling

56:58.270 --> 57:02.128
a certain lack of confidence
in customs enforcement.

57:02.592 --> 57:05.251
Could be a whole new set
of rules on the horizon.

57:05.976 --> 57:08.849
L.O.N. can have any rules they want.
I still have mine.

57:09.237 --> 57:12.330
I understand you're getting
in the cage with Wasyl.

57:12.556 --> 57:14.413
He sucker punched me.

57:14.773 --> 57:17.675
We'll see how tough he is in a fair fight.

57:17.676 --> 57:20.090
I dunno, a grain fed prairie farm boy?

57:20.091 --> 57:22.858
Dumb as a sack of hammers but fucking tough.

57:22.953 --> 57:26.104
I have been in one or two
farms in my life as well.

57:37.159 --> 57:38.750
What, are you living here now?

57:38.877 --> 57:41.047
Clive seems to do better when I'm around.

57:41.291 --> 57:42.933
All right.

57:42.934 --> 57:44.764
Notining wrong with his appetite.

57:45.328 --> 57:48.391
Well, I have to feed him,
but yeah, he's eating good.

57:48.476 --> 57:50.177
His hands work better now.

57:50.504 --> 57:52.189
He likes to put them here,

57:52.520 --> 57:53.936
like this.

57:56.827 --> 57:58.320
You sure he's not conscious?

57:59.432 --> 58:02.312
Well, he's sort of half here
and half not, I don't know.

58:03.092 --> 58:04.741
Do you think he'll ever be right again?

58:04.830 --> 58:06.325
Too soon to know.

58:07.576 --> 58:09.078
Listen, do you think it's weird

58:09.079 --> 58:11.787
Anton and Sergei tried to get in the back way?

58:12.313 --> 58:14.672
And just then, Wasyl shows up?

58:15.170 --> 58:17.574
Wasyl follows me like a puppy.
You know that.

58:18.202 --> 58:21.807
Yeah, everyone knows that. Even Anton.

58:21.808 --> 58:24.436
They're looking for you everywhere.
The Mongolian "awaked".

58:24.437 --> 58:26.514
Oh, shit! Bataar!

58:36.637 --> 58:38.010
Hey, buddy.

58:38.581 --> 58:40.195
Can you tell me what you took?

58:40.970 --> 58:42.120
Needle?

58:42.749 --> 58:43.796
Pill?

58:44.963 --> 58:47.821
Pill. Okay. What color was it?

58:50.688 --> 58:52.637
Blue? Like his pants?

58:54.759 --> 58:55.943
Purple?

58:56.895 --> 58:59.657
Purple. Purple.

58:59.798 --> 59:02.433
A purple pill. Okay.

59:06.055 --> 59:09.341
Can you take him back to the Chinese sector
and see if you can keep him home for awhile?

59:09.342 --> 59:12.217
I'll do my best. I'm going to need some help.

59:20.906 --> 59:24.382
Hello, Vic. So, just a review:
you have a Chinese rig worker...

59:24.383 --> 59:27.128
- Mongolian.
- High on a banned recreational drug...

59:27.129 --> 59:28.717
- Which he did not get from me.
- ...but which he was enjoying

59:28.718 --> 59:31.798
in your ZipGrav. I won't
even get into the book-making,

59:31.799 --> 59:33.852
the pilfering of goods
held in trust by customs.

59:33.853 --> 59:35.908
The Danes complained to
me about missing Aquavit.

59:35.909 --> 59:37.676
- I thought you weren't going to get into it.
- You think nothing can happen

59:37.677 --> 59:39.514
to you, but you're wrong.
Borealis is about to change

59:39.515 --> 59:41.298
for the better and that
is not good news for you.

59:41.299 --> 59:42.534
Let me guess,

59:42.535 --> 59:45.069
Svetlana Virchou is about to
become your new best friend, right?

59:45.070 --> 59:48.302
If the L.O.N. puts its security muscle
behind the Canadian authority on the ground...

59:48.303 --> 59:49.926
- Meaning you.
- whatever protection

59:49.927 --> 59:53.149
you've been getting from Ottawa
is going to melt away like the last iceberg.

59:53.150 --> 59:54.743
Are you really this stupid?

59:54.744 --> 59:57.728
You actually think L.O.N. wants
to protect Canadian sovereignty?

59:57.729 --> 01:00:00.847
L.O.N. is about order and good
government and so am I.

01:00:00.848 --> 01:00:04.524
L.O.N. is about taking control of a place
and selling it off to the highest bidder.

01:00:04.525 --> 01:00:07.711
Suez, Panama, Borneo, Madagascar,

01:00:07.712 --> 01:00:08.868
Nepal...

01:00:08.961 --> 01:00:13.239
In case you haven't noticed, we are sitting
on the last oil and gas reserve on the planet.

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:15.254
You think they don't want a piece of that?

01:00:15.287 --> 01:00:18.123
You're about to become
Svetlana Virchou's valet.

01:00:18.124 --> 01:00:20.386
You heard it here first, friend.

01:00:27.007 --> 01:00:28.556
I brought you something.

01:00:30.459 --> 01:00:33.001
I used to have a cat who brought
me presents like that.

01:00:33.532 --> 01:00:35.374
Yellow breasted meadow lark.

01:00:36.772 --> 01:00:38.757
Given the plumage, I'm guessing it's a male.

01:00:40.541 --> 01:00:41.679
Yeah.

01:00:41.738 --> 01:00:44.698
Never documented this far north.
That's crazy.

01:00:45.509 --> 01:00:48.223
You know, the ancient Romans believed
that flights of birds were a portent.

01:00:49.049 --> 01:00:51.811
- Of what?
- That's the question isn't it?

01:00:52.707 --> 01:00:55.479
I have tea or Aquavit.

01:00:56.107 --> 01:00:59.074
- Tea please.
- Come on.

01:01:05.338 --> 01:01:08.290
You seem more interested
in biology than archeology.

01:01:09.294 --> 01:01:12.004
Yeah. I guess I don't
really draw a rigid line.

01:01:13.026 --> 01:01:15.302
I'm up here looking for
human-specific sites, but

01:01:15.303 --> 01:01:17.637
it's all environment, the living and the dead.

01:01:17.888 --> 01:01:20.500
Even the oil's transformed
vegetation and dinosaurs.

01:01:21.437 --> 01:01:23.759
And yet you never seem to find anything.

01:01:24.874 --> 01:01:27.680
True. I guess I'm not very good.

01:01:27.681 --> 01:01:30.429
Really, it's just an excuse
to wander around and camp out.

01:01:30.907 --> 01:01:33.543
Anyways, I do find some things.

01:01:36.810 --> 01:01:40.452
Like this Arctic fox den. It's
hidden along the Sirmlik Ridge.

01:01:40.943 --> 01:01:42.271
Oh my God...

01:01:42.881 --> 01:01:44.423
Don't show this to anyone in town.

01:01:44.424 --> 01:01:45.575
No, of course not.

01:01:45.576 --> 01:01:47.690
You never know with some of those idiots.

01:01:47.693 --> 01:01:51.548
Maybe with the L.O.N. around, we can finally
start keeping animals like this alive.

01:01:53.236 --> 01:01:55.923
Hoshi, I need some help.
I'm trying to run a guy:

01:01:55.924 --> 01:02:00.114
Russian; Sergei Krutinulov;
born 2011, Volgograd.

01:02:00.115 --> 01:02:02.616
Supposedly graduated as
a mechanical engineer, but

01:02:02.617 --> 01:02:06.051
based on his facial scars, unless he's
beating himself daily with a slide rule,

01:02:06.052 --> 01:02:08.009
there ain't no way he's an engineer.

01:02:08.010 --> 01:02:09.522
I'm going to send you the link.

01:02:10.341 --> 01:02:11.859
At your convenience.

01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:15.374
Please. Your most humble servant... Victor.

01:02:23.862 --> 01:02:24.970
Let me guess:

01:02:24.971 --> 01:02:27.696
Ms. Virchou requests the
pleasure of my company.

01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:35.496
You have got some really nice stuff in here.

01:02:35.501 --> 01:02:38.026
- Thank you.
- I really like these chairs.

01:02:38.818 --> 01:02:43.688
Nice! Lightweight, shiny, stackable...

01:02:43.697 --> 01:02:45.442
Would look great in my bar.

01:02:45.611 --> 01:02:47.712
So, bad news, Vic:

01:02:48.674 --> 01:02:51.214
I've been alerted that
certain archeological material,

01:02:51.215 --> 01:02:55.272
specifically thousand-year-old ship spikes,
were recently stolen from a Russian dig site.

01:02:55.273 --> 01:02:56.346
No!

01:02:56.385 --> 01:02:59.383
I've been told they may have
been confiscated by customs.

01:03:01.646 --> 01:03:05.291
I was told you were second runner
up in Miss Teen Geneva 2029.

01:03:06.077 --> 01:03:08.432
Well, maybe we were both misinformed.

01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:11.135
Did Anton tell you I took those spikes?

01:03:11.136 --> 01:03:12.651
I'm not big on blaming.

01:03:12.791 --> 01:03:16.562
If the Russians get their property back, there'll
be no reason to pursue the matter further.

01:03:16.962 --> 01:03:18.474
If the Russians get their property back,

01:03:18.475 --> 01:03:21.109
they'll use it to consolidate their
sovereignty claim on the whole territory.

01:03:21.110 --> 01:03:23.728
I don't care if they want to build
a new ship and sail it back to Russia...

01:03:23.729 --> 01:03:25.692
not really the point, is it?

01:03:26.212 --> 01:03:30.030
I have to say, I am struggling to
understand the point as it relates to you.

01:03:30.031 --> 01:03:33.656
- Good works and harmony, Vic.
- Good works and harmony...

01:03:45.601 --> 01:03:47.034
Don't do it.

01:03:47.103 --> 01:03:48.773
Bataar, don't do it!

01:03:49.301 --> 01:03:50.397
Bataar!

01:04:27.963 --> 01:04:29.476
Can you send the body back to the family?

01:04:29.477 --> 01:04:30.623
No.

01:04:30.813 --> 01:04:33.272
I'll take him out to the dump for the bears.

01:04:34.802 --> 01:04:36.750
Don't give me that fucking look.

01:04:36.803 --> 01:04:39.010
It's called the casting out ceremony.

01:04:39.011 --> 01:04:43.519
The Mongols, they believe their last virtuous
act is to give their body to the animals.

01:04:43.923 --> 01:04:45.714
You people don't know anything.

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:48.558
- You should've kept him at home.
- You try and keep him at home!

01:04:48.790 --> 01:04:50.608
Mongols, they do what they want.

01:04:51.159 --> 01:04:52.907
Look, he got the side-effects, okay?

01:04:52.908 --> 01:04:56.266
That's why he came back here, to get
the son of a bitch who gave it to him.

01:04:56.267 --> 01:04:57.696
Bad choice.

01:04:57.797 --> 01:04:59.753
- You see it?
- One kick.

01:04:59.754 --> 01:05:01.952
Bullet to the brain would have been slower.

01:05:06.457 --> 01:05:08.015
Pace is a dead man.

01:05:12.588 --> 01:05:13.734
Profile's cooked up.

01:05:13.735 --> 01:05:17.864
Sergei Krutinulov was kicked off the
Russian army's special forces in 2038.

01:05:17.865 --> 01:05:20.951
He went in the fight circuit in
South-East Asia under the name Ivan Fiorin.

01:05:20.952 --> 01:05:23.384
Found a new career in
corporate special assignments.

01:05:23.385 --> 01:05:24.533
What kind of assignments?

01:05:24.534 --> 01:05:26.469
The kind where someone ends
up dead somewhere in the world.

01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:28.053
What's he doing in Borealis?

01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:30.244
He didn't come for Bataar.

01:05:30.245 --> 01:05:31.738
Or Wasyl, I'm guessing.

01:05:31.739 --> 01:05:35.799
The more your town appears out of control,
the better case the L.O.N. has to take over.

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:37.941
The Russians have to
believe that's good for them.

01:05:38.016 --> 01:05:39.228
This is about the spikes.

01:05:39.229 --> 01:05:43.316
They killed a Norwegian and now a Mongolian
for those spikes. They won't stop now.

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:44.597
Be careful!

01:05:46.872 --> 01:05:48.765
You wanna be the big dog around here?

01:05:48.766 --> 01:05:52.056
Arrest the Russian! He killed an unarmed
Mongolian in the middle of the street!

01:05:52.057 --> 01:05:53.120
In self defense.

01:05:53.121 --> 01:05:54.389
Who do you think brought in the ghost meth?

01:05:54.390 --> 01:05:56.310
- You.
- Raminder, why the hell

01:05:56.311 --> 01:05:59.511
would I bring that shit into my bar? You
think I want people chewing on my furniture,

01:05:59.512 --> 01:06:02.467
- clawing holes in my walls?
- So why would anyone sell it?

01:06:02.621 --> 01:06:05.371
To make us all look bad, so the dragon lady

01:06:05.372 --> 01:06:07.899
can swoop in and pretend to
fix it all after we're gone.

01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:11.562
- You're paranoid.
- Oh, for fuck's sakes. Wasyl!

01:06:11.794 --> 01:06:14.088
Listen to me: Sergei killed Bataar

01:06:14.089 --> 01:06:17.891
with a single blow in a fraction of a second.
Is that how you want to die, huh?

01:06:17.892 --> 01:06:20.359
Pulling up your jock strap
as you step into the ring?

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:23.178
Someone's got to show these Russians
whose country they're screwing with.

01:06:23.179 --> 01:06:27.403
If we just roll over, what's the point?
Why even put the uniform on?

01:06:27.404 --> 01:06:30.962
There's brave and
there's just plain stupid.

01:06:30.963 --> 01:06:32.740
Which one are you going to be, Wasyl?

01:06:32.741 --> 01:06:34.820
I'm not chickening out.

01:06:34.821 --> 01:06:37.878
Then you're going to die.
You know that, right?

01:06:37.879 --> 01:06:39.653
Look, I'm not backing down.

01:06:39.964 --> 01:06:41.963
We're doing enough of
that around here already.

01:06:42.496 --> 01:06:44.132
It's not why I signed up.

01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:59.630
What happened here?

01:06:59.827 --> 01:07:02.600
- Bear broke into it last night.
- In the middle of town?

01:07:02.601 --> 01:07:06.390
Yep. You might want to keep that in mind next
time you're strolling around after dark.

01:07:06.939 --> 01:07:10.332
Such magnificent creatures.
It's criminal they're reduced to this.

01:07:10.890 --> 01:07:13.948
Stealing my expensive and
hard earned meat supply?

01:07:13.949 --> 01:07:15.167
Yes. Criminal.

01:07:15.168 --> 01:07:17.719
Even the wildlife gets a piece
of the action in Borealis.

01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:19.909
Any idea how cynical you sound, Vic?

01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:21.028
Some.

01:07:21.984 --> 01:07:25.275
I got no problem with people
protecting their turf. I get it.

01:07:25.613 --> 01:07:27.997
I just don't understand what
it is you're trying to protect.

01:07:27.998 --> 01:07:29.794
- The peace.
- Really?

01:07:29.858 --> 01:07:32.270
- Then arrest Sergei.
- It was self-defense.

01:07:32.271 --> 01:07:35.830
No. Not for Bataar, for Wasyl. For the
crime that's about to be committed.

01:07:35.831 --> 01:07:38.516
Two men who sign waivers
willingly step into a cage.

01:07:38.517 --> 01:07:41.127
You know something about this.
It's not my place to stop it.

01:07:41.128 --> 01:07:45.230
Fine. Then do it to stop the ghost meth.
Sergei's the one who brought it in.

01:07:45.231 --> 01:07:47.872
Neither one of us can prove
that and even if we could,

01:07:47.881 --> 01:07:51.042
once I start down the road of arresting
people for bringing in drugs...

01:07:51.043 --> 01:07:54.217
you see how this ends badly
for me and probably you too?

01:07:54.246 --> 01:07:55.330
Excellent point.

01:07:55.331 --> 01:07:57.848
Stolen Russian artifacts on the other hand...

01:07:58.747 --> 01:08:01.571
I don't know why you like Anton's
money better than you like mine.

01:08:01.572 --> 01:08:03.664
You see the world as black and white.

01:08:03.665 --> 01:08:05.299
Grey and darker grey.

01:08:05.414 --> 01:08:08.271
Life is a multicolored fabric, Vic.

01:08:08.272 --> 01:08:10.862
Don't assume I hold only
one viewpoint at a time.

01:08:10.999 --> 01:08:12.995
Vic, they're tearing up your place!

01:08:13.002 --> 01:08:14.762
- Who is?
- Her guys!

01:08:15.336 --> 01:08:17.656
You don't make it easy to
stay friends with you, lady.

01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:32.743
You hit me with that and you'll miss
your buddy's funeral, I'm not kidding.

01:08:32.743 --> 01:08:34.515
You up on territorial homeowners' rights?

01:08:34.517 --> 01:08:37.174
I'm allowed to kill anything that
comes unwelcome through that door.

01:08:37.175 --> 01:08:39.294
There are two ways to
leave this room, you pick.

01:08:56.890 --> 01:09:00.871
Okay. I'm glad everyone is having
a nice time, screwing in my hotel,

01:09:00.872 --> 01:09:03.805
eating my food, drinking my booze.

01:09:03.805 --> 01:09:05.716
But the free ride is over.

01:09:05.716 --> 01:09:07.912
Yeah, I'm starting to feel
a little bit better, Vic.

01:09:07.913 --> 01:09:08.912
No shit.

01:09:08.913 --> 01:09:11.975
Bettina was just helping me
relearn certain sensations.

01:09:12.282 --> 01:09:15.743
- I think he's almost back to normal.
- Why is that my business?

01:09:15.743 --> 01:09:17.401
Why is it your business, for that matter?

01:09:17.402 --> 01:09:20.207
Why shouldn't I help him?
He's got a second chance to live,

01:09:20.209 --> 01:09:21.604
who wouldn't want that?

01:09:22.599 --> 01:09:25.774
You're alive enough to do this,
you're alive enough to get a job

01:09:25.776 --> 01:09:27.368
and pay your way.

01:09:40.755 --> 01:09:42.059
Call off your man.

01:09:42.736 --> 01:09:44.669
And what have you done for me lately?

01:09:45.402 --> 01:09:48.130
Call him off or you and I are
going to have a very big problem.

01:09:48.131 --> 01:09:50.804
You and I, we already have a problem.

01:09:51.019 --> 01:09:54.042
You stole archeological materials
that are very important to me.

01:09:54.042 --> 01:09:56.395
- I don't have your spikes.
- Spare me.

01:09:56.396 --> 01:10:00.050
We are grown men, are we
not? We can speak plainly.

01:10:00.791 --> 01:10:02.625
I know who Sergei is.

01:10:03.606 --> 01:10:08.187
Then you know the loudmouth Canadian soldier
will surely die if he sets foot in that cage.

01:10:08.188 --> 01:10:11.110
Bring me my spikes, maybe he lives.

01:10:12.518 --> 01:10:13.982
These are my terms.

01:10:14.108 --> 01:10:18.282
- You shouldn't count on my affection
for that half wit Canadian soldier...

01:10:20.969 --> 01:10:22.852
Whatever you say, Vic.

01:10:26.431 --> 01:10:29.462
So you're just gonna let Sergei kill Wasyl?

01:10:29.531 --> 01:10:31.169
Why is this my problem?

01:10:31.402 --> 01:10:33.696
I came up here to make some money
and get the hell back down south...

01:10:33.697 --> 01:10:36.771
It's not my job to look after all
these half-wits and invalids, alright?

01:10:36.772 --> 01:10:38.829
That's how I felt when you arrived.

01:10:40.056 --> 01:10:41.497
I've got a business to run.

01:10:41.498 --> 01:10:43.740
Shipping manifests to forge,
I don't have time for this.

01:10:43.741 --> 01:10:46.158
Yes, you're a busy, busy man, I know.

01:10:47.893 --> 01:10:50.450
You think Anton would pull
Sergei off if he got the spikes?

01:10:50.583 --> 01:10:51.749
That's what he says.

01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:53.792
Doesn't really matter if
the Russians run the place.

01:10:53.793 --> 01:10:56.983
Just another set of white guys. You
all kind of look alike, you know that?

01:10:56.984 --> 01:10:58.066
Thanks.

01:10:58.597 --> 01:11:00.428
You could cut a deal with Anton.

01:11:00.506 --> 01:11:03.823
They think they can come in here and take
something I built with my own two hands.

01:11:03.824 --> 01:11:05.391
And my two hands.

01:11:05.439 --> 01:11:07.498
- Okay.
- And somewhere in there there were Sikh hands.

01:11:07.499 --> 01:11:08.816
The point is,

01:11:08.817 --> 01:11:12.577
Borealis is mine. At least, this
part of it, and I'm not giving it up.

01:11:13.315 --> 01:11:15.809
Plus, he's using Wasyl to get to me.

01:11:16.568 --> 01:11:17.820
I hate that.

01:11:18.331 --> 01:11:20.131
Good thing that's not working.

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:34.531
Clive.

01:11:37.862 --> 01:11:38.974
Clive?

01:11:44.029 --> 01:11:45.112
Hey.

01:11:45.478 --> 01:11:47.788
Okay. It's okay.

01:11:50.533 --> 01:11:53.697
I was just walking and then...

01:11:55.462 --> 01:11:57.002
I don't know how to describe it...

01:11:57.003 --> 01:11:59.284
It was like my brain exploding.

01:11:59.599 --> 01:12:02.986
Tiny pieces of me flying up
and spreading out until I'm so thin...

01:12:02.987 --> 01:12:05.578
Like I'm not here anymore,
like I'm just...

01:12:05.639 --> 01:12:07.033
gone.

01:12:07.883 --> 01:12:09.373
Do you know what I mean?

01:12:10.177 --> 01:12:11.498
- Yeah.
- And then suddenly,

01:12:11.499 --> 01:12:13.630
I'm back here and there's
this huge weight on me,

01:12:13.631 --> 01:12:16.364
and I'm trying to keep myself together,
to stop myself from flying apart again

01:12:16.365 --> 01:12:18.217
but it feels impossible...

01:12:18.392 --> 01:12:19.899
Seems like when you die,

01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:21.956
not all of you gets to come back.

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:25.080
Who made that rule?

01:12:26.055 --> 01:12:27.623
I got nowhere to go, Vic.

01:12:27.624 --> 01:12:30.622
The rigs won't take me; the
Russians still want me dead.

01:12:30.623 --> 01:12:33.246
Meanwhile, I'm walking around
like I'm half here with the rest

01:12:33.247 --> 01:12:36.496
of me following behind like
a cloud of fucking mosquitoes.

01:12:38.234 --> 01:12:40.774
I'm not so sure death was a bad thing, man.

01:13:21.567 --> 01:13:23.559
You touch me and I'll stamp
that beret down your throat.

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:25.518
It's all right. It's all right.

01:13:25.596 --> 01:13:27.058
Come inside, please.

01:13:28.228 --> 01:13:31.185
Arctic fox, killed on natural heritage land.

01:13:31.186 --> 01:13:33.842
There are only six breeding
pairs in Scandinavia,

01:13:33.843 --> 01:13:35.793
maybe only thirty in North America.

01:13:35.794 --> 01:13:37.049
Who did this?

01:13:40.886 --> 01:13:42.312
I don't read Cyrillic.

01:13:44.212 --> 01:13:45.511
But maybe you do.

01:13:46.517 --> 01:13:49.671
Why would Russians shoot a fox
and leave a valuable pelt behind?

01:13:49.672 --> 01:13:51.775
It's a message for me. A threat,

01:13:51.983 --> 01:13:53.963
because I outed them on my blog.

01:13:55.190 --> 01:13:57.741
You said things are going to be different.
So what are you going to do about this?

01:13:57.742 --> 01:14:01.853
A shell casing is not conclusive proof,
but whoever did this will be aggressively,

01:14:01.854 --> 01:14:03.638
Chatted with?

01:14:03.931 --> 01:14:06.711
The next foreign poacher I see
will be going home in a bag.

01:14:06.712 --> 01:14:08.361
Alison, I need more time.

01:14:08.362 --> 01:14:10.213
You're just adding to the noise.

01:14:24.634 --> 01:14:27.131
- Dan, give me that.
- No.

01:14:27.566 --> 01:14:29.805
I'm not going to let that little
Russian kill somebody else.

01:14:29.806 --> 01:14:31.856
Don't interfere in this, Dan. I'm warning you.

01:14:31.996 --> 01:14:33.819
I know what happened, okay?

01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:36.314
I saw the pictures you posted.
But you can't do this alone.

01:14:36.315 --> 01:14:38.059
Who else is going to stop them?

01:14:38.599 --> 01:14:40.560
You? Those idiots at the army base?

01:14:40.561 --> 01:14:43.098
I don't know, but it's
not going to happen like this.

01:14:43.099 --> 01:14:44.203
Not today.

01:14:44.699 --> 01:14:46.607
Come on.
Let's go for a walk.

01:14:54.388 --> 01:14:57.042
- Alison's taking it pretty hard.
- I don't blame her.

01:14:57.215 --> 01:14:59.174
She'll be next if she doesn't
leave this alone.

01:14:59.175 --> 01:15:02.078
Need to have a rocket while fighting
the new Russian these days.

01:15:02.374 --> 01:15:04.806
They must be pretty confident
over their territorial claim.

01:15:04.807 --> 01:15:08.009
They control the last oil, then
the last water, then the last food.

01:15:08.010 --> 01:15:09.951
It's gonna get ugly for the rest of us.

01:15:10.833 --> 01:15:12.657
If a person had some archeological items

01:15:12.658 --> 01:15:15.686
that needed to find their way
back to the original owners,

01:15:15.687 --> 01:15:18.203
a particular museum in Norway...

01:15:18.453 --> 01:15:19.574
Yes.

01:15:20.573 --> 01:15:22.869
How would that person guarantee delivery?

01:15:23.282 --> 01:15:24.963
That person would give them to me.

01:15:24.964 --> 01:15:26.979
Is that a theoretical
question or a practical one?

01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:28.115
Not sure yet.

01:15:38.328 --> 01:15:40.955
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Vic.

01:15:41.192 --> 01:15:43.680
Listen, I've been studying your last fight,

01:15:43.754 --> 01:15:45.621
and I figured out where you made your mistake.

01:15:45.622 --> 01:15:47.844
Is that so? Good for you.

01:15:48.101 --> 01:15:50.369
- How do you feel?
- I'm ready.

01:15:50.370 --> 01:15:52.169
- Are you?
- Yeah.

01:15:53.246 --> 01:15:55.719
He's tougher than what I first thought, but

01:15:56.369 --> 01:15:58.136
I can handle myself too.

01:15:58.370 --> 01:16:00.580
You think I'm afraid of him. I'm not.

01:16:00.581 --> 01:16:01.944
I know.

01:16:02.702 --> 01:16:05.178
So what was my mistake?

01:16:07.403 --> 01:16:09.962
Well, when you went for the takedown...

01:16:10.241 --> 01:16:11.785
Please, show me.

01:16:12.672 --> 01:16:15.445
You went for a double when you
should've just went for a single.

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:17.318
Sorry.

01:16:21.141 --> 01:16:22.176
Sit up and sit still.

01:16:22.177 --> 01:16:25.211
- It's dislocated.
- Sit up and sit still.

01:16:25.212 --> 01:16:28.393
Trust me. Bite this. Bite, bite.

01:16:28.394 --> 01:16:31.229
I'm gonna count to three, okay? One...

01:16:37.998 --> 01:16:41.015
You're gonna want a bunch of
analgesics and some anti inflams.

01:16:41.016 --> 01:16:43.903
There's going to be ligament damage
but you should be okay in 4 to 6 weeks.

01:16:43.904 --> 01:16:45.081
At least you're alive.

01:16:45.653 --> 01:16:46.988
What about the fight?

01:16:46.989 --> 01:16:49.468
- It's off.
- Damn it.

01:16:54.468 --> 01:16:56.716
Wasyl's out. I'm in.

01:16:59.136 --> 01:17:01.224
And this solves my problem, how?

01:17:01.225 --> 01:17:02.638
Who said I'm solving your problem?

01:17:02.639 --> 01:17:04.298
Wasyl's injured, he can't fight.

01:17:04.672 --> 01:17:05.861
I'm his second.

01:17:08.415 --> 01:17:11.113
You haven't been in the
cage in a long time, Vic.

01:17:11.114 --> 01:17:12.973
Last time didn't end well...

01:17:13.261 --> 01:17:16.043
A lot of punishment to
the head over the years.

01:17:16.686 --> 01:17:18.814
My understanding is it wouldn't take much...

01:17:18.815 --> 01:17:21.062
To what? Kill me again?

01:17:22.935 --> 01:17:24.186
I guess we'll find out.

01:17:25.137 --> 01:17:26.827
You're a businessman, like me.

01:17:26.828 --> 01:17:30.782
Why should you die over this
small thing, these old spikes?

01:17:31.552 --> 01:17:33.125
Let's negotiate.

01:17:35.124 --> 01:17:36.555
You have nothing I want.

01:17:43.088 --> 01:17:45.643
Just make sure he doesn't
get any head shots in.

01:17:46.191 --> 01:17:47.905
I'll write a note to myself.

01:17:49.503 --> 01:17:53.463
I'm just curious, given that he's younger,

01:17:53.464 --> 01:17:55.947
stronger, faster

01:17:55.948 --> 01:17:58.054
and possibly more skilled than you

01:17:58.285 --> 01:18:00.681
what makes you think you're
going to survive this fight?

01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:06.237
If you get killed, it'll be a great
inconvenience to me personally.

01:18:08.603 --> 01:18:10.403
Yeah, well...

01:18:10.723 --> 01:18:12.141
if I don't make it,

01:18:12.930 --> 01:18:14.291
feel free to shoot him.

01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:32.406
What do you want?

01:18:33.147 --> 01:18:35.045
If all the good men get killed around here,

01:18:35.046 --> 01:18:38.042
only the bad idiots are left.
What's going to happen to me?

01:18:38.664 --> 01:18:40.381
Another vote of confidence.

01:18:41.412 --> 01:18:43.112
You should be in bed, you have to sleep.

01:18:43.113 --> 01:18:46.187
Come. Come on, Vic!

01:18:54.983 --> 01:18:57.940
- No, no.
- No, it's not for sex, you dumbass.

01:18:57.954 --> 01:19:00.630
It's because I'm nervous
and I don't like to be alone.

01:19:08.631 --> 01:19:10.086
No sex.

01:19:10.693 --> 01:19:11.976
Just sleep.

01:19:20.479 --> 01:19:24.176
I saw you once, back in Montreal.

01:19:26.419 --> 01:19:28.567
This guy took me to one of your fights.

01:19:29.784 --> 01:19:32.032
We had good seats, he was a high roller.

01:19:33.390 --> 01:19:36.263
And I had these beautiful
white boots back then,

01:19:37.243 --> 01:19:41.553
and when I went home, I was
taking them off and I noticed...

01:19:42.175 --> 01:19:44.712
...these little spots of blood on them.

01:19:47.726 --> 01:19:49.324
So I threw them out.

01:20:26.100 --> 01:20:27.178
Go ahead.

01:20:33.059 --> 01:20:34.215
Can I talk to him?

01:20:38.010 --> 01:20:40.889
Listen, I just wanted to come
by and wish you good luck today.

01:20:40.890 --> 01:20:42.373
If there's anything I can do...

01:20:42.374 --> 01:20:43.623
Like what?

01:20:44.354 --> 01:20:45.921
Whatever...

01:20:46.197 --> 01:20:48.159
that package you wanted delivered.

01:20:48.913 --> 01:20:50.441
We'll talk after the fight.

01:20:53.557 --> 01:20:57.300
Sure, okay, it's just that...

01:20:57.301 --> 01:20:58.618
What?

01:20:59.351 --> 01:21:01.168
I might be dead after the fight?

01:21:01.343 --> 01:21:04.665
No, well... but if something happens, then...

01:21:04.666 --> 01:21:06.130
Get out.

01:21:10.444 --> 01:21:11.478
Okay.

01:21:16.209 --> 01:21:17.273
Is it time?

01:21:45.602 --> 01:21:47.440
I want to put on the record at this point

01:21:47.441 --> 01:21:51.522
that Mr. Krutinulov has agreed to withdraw
his complaint against private Demchuck

01:21:51.523 --> 01:21:55.285
and agrees not to press charges,
providing the missing items are returned

01:21:55.286 --> 01:21:57.425
to the Russian archeological site.

01:21:58.342 --> 01:22:01.044
Mr. Carboneau, do you understand
what's being offered here?

01:22:01.578 --> 01:22:02.775
Yes.

01:22:02.776 --> 01:22:06.845
And you choose of your own free will
to compete in this cage fight as a second

01:22:06.848 --> 01:22:09.436
for the injured Canadian
soldier Wasyl Demchuk?

01:22:09.437 --> 01:22:10.698
Yes.

01:22:20.351 --> 01:22:21.836
Mr. Krutinulov.

01:22:29.853 --> 01:22:32.136
You can do it, Vic. Kill this idiot!

01:22:32.619 --> 01:22:34.064
Go for his head.

01:22:41.692 --> 01:22:42.946
Get him, Vic.

01:23:14.602 --> 01:23:16.412
Come on, Vic! Pound him!

01:23:33.164 --> 01:23:34.927
Come on, Vic! Get him!

01:24:18.114 --> 01:24:19.919
Come on, Vic! Come on!

01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:42.174
Come on, Vic! Get him!

01:25:20.070 --> 01:25:21.215
Vic!

01:25:23.701 --> 01:25:26.159
It doesn't end like this.

01:25:33.928 --> 01:25:36.314
Come on, Vic! Come on, Vic!

01:25:46.587 --> 01:25:50.179
Vic! Vic! Vic! Vic! Vic! Vic!

01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:52.036
Vic! Vic!

01:26:13.642 --> 01:26:17.152
Vic! Vic! Vic! Vic! Vic! Vic!

01:26:17.153 --> 01:26:19.967
Vic! Vic! Vic! Vic! Vic!

01:26:19.968 --> 01:26:22.910
Vic! Vic! Vic! Vic! Vic! Vic!

01:26:22.911 --> 01:26:24.641
Vic! Watch out!

01:26:46.665 --> 01:26:47.983
Open the gate.

01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:15.887
You're never going to get those spikes.
