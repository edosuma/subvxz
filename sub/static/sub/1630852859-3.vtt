00:01.724 --> 00:02.620
Where you going?

00:02.655 --> 00:04.172
<i>Previously on</i>
I Am Shauna Rae.

00:04.206 --> 00:07.275
Every time I leave
the house my parents
do ask me questions.

00:07.310 --> 00:11.965
My mom is probably the worst.
I'm like the child that never
grew up in her eyes.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.965
When I tell my parents
that I'm moving out,

00:14.000 --> 00:15.655
I don't think
it'll go over well.

00:15.689 --> 00:18.413
How's your, what is it?
Dating apps?

00:18.448 --> 00:20.034
Oh, I gave up on those.

00:20.068 --> 00:22.551
Shauna's dating life
has been a show.

00:22.586 --> 00:24.517
Have you ever tried
matchmaking?

00:24.551 --> 00:28.724
I'm a relationship person
so I would say I'm looking for
a long term connection.

00:28.758 --> 00:32.103
<i>I'm gonna ask</i> <i>
a bunch of questions</i> <i>
about your past.</i>

00:32.137 --> 00:34.000
It is scary
to put myself out there.

00:34.034 --> 00:37.931
But if I don't do that
I don't think I can ever find
a relationship.

00:37.965 --> 00:42.103
<i>I'm not going to set you up</i> <i>
with anyone that I</i> <i>
don't personally like.</i>

00:42.137 --> 00:45.241
I haven't met
those kind of guys
she describing.

00:45.275 --> 00:48.379
We'll see. I mean,
I hope they're out there
like she says they are.

00:59.137 --> 01:00.000
Shirts.

01:02.206 --> 01:03.689
Out of the closet.

01:03.724 --> 01:05.379
- They're gonna eat my closet.
Yeah.

01:05.413 --> 01:08.862
My sister's helped me set up
an online dating profile
a while ago.

01:08.896 --> 01:11.000
But I realized online dating
wasn't for me,

01:11.034 --> 01:14.000
so my mom suggested
that I give matchmaking
a shot.

01:14.034 --> 01:15.206
Okay, where you going?

01:17.172 --> 01:18.482
Bowling.

01:18.517 --> 01:20.034
After talking
with the matchmaker

01:20.068 --> 01:21.793
she found some great
date options,

01:21.827 --> 01:23.206
so I'm meeting
one of them tonight.

01:24.206 --> 01:25.172
No.
Yes.

01:25.206 --> 01:26.034
No.

01:26.689 --> 01:28.793
No. No.

01:29.655 --> 01:30.931
No.

01:30.965 --> 01:32.275
This is
taking a while.

01:33.586 --> 01:36.172
I have never been
on a blind date.

01:36.206 --> 01:40.793
<i>I have a bunch of worries</i> <i>
going into a blind date.</i>

01:40.827 --> 01:43.724
<i>Because I worry about</i> <i>
my dates reaction to my size.</i>

01:43.758 --> 01:47.241
Because a lot of people
don't understand
how short 3'10'' is.

01:47.275 --> 01:50.206
A lot of people are like,
"Oh, well, you're like
right up to my shoulder."

01:50.241 --> 01:51.965
I'm like,
"No. I'm up to your groin."

01:52.000 --> 01:54.068
Like, that's the scary part.

01:54.103 --> 01:57.379
<i>Because you're not only gonna</i> <i>
see the reaction</i> <i>
to your height.</i>

01:57.413 --> 02:01.000
You're gonna see the reaction
to other people reacting
to your height, too.

02:01.034 --> 02:01.862
Boots?

02:03.137 --> 02:04.241
No.

02:04.275 --> 02:06.103
Why is nothing I pick
good enough?

02:08.068 --> 02:10.689
- I like those ones.
- You're gonna
make me wear these!

02:10.724 --> 02:12.241
Just to take them off to bowl.

02:13.965 --> 02:16.517
As I'm getting ready
I am anxious.

02:16.551 --> 02:20.241
It's just weird with my family
being super,
super involved in it.

02:20.689 --> 02:22.172
Matchmaker box.

02:22.206 --> 02:24.034
- Oh, yay.
- You gotta do it.

02:24.862 --> 02:26.034
Sure.

02:26.068 --> 02:29.551
Gabby the matchmaker
sent me a first date package.

02:29.586 --> 02:34.103
Which is just a couple items
to help you feel ease
on the first date.

02:34.137 --> 02:37.241
This is,

02:37.275 --> 02:39.000
The scent.
- The scent.

02:39.034 --> 02:40.586
The pumpkin lavender.

02:40.620 --> 02:43.275
Scientifically best scent
for attraction.

02:43.310 --> 02:46.206
- Scientifically?
- Yes, scientifically.
Let's smell this.

02:46.241 --> 02:50.068
There were five items
in the box that Gabby gave me,
one was a book.

02:50.103 --> 02:54.827
It's about spirituality
and finding, like, mental love
and all this stuff.

02:54.862 --> 02:57.586
And then one was

02:57.620 --> 03:00.793
the most attractive scent
in the world,

03:00.827 --> 03:03.482
which is a mixture of pumpkin
and lavender.

03:04.586 --> 03:06.137
It's not that great.

03:06.172 --> 03:08.448
I don't know
if I want to wear it
cause of the pumpkin.

03:12.379 --> 03:14.344
- Pull more out.

03:14.379 --> 03:16.034
Fine, I'm just putting it
on my wrist.

03:16.068 --> 03:18.413
Cause he's not gonna touch
anything more than my hand.

03:19.862 --> 03:21.482
I don't think
that's what that's for.

03:21.517 --> 03:24.413
I would not consider
pumpkin to be

03:25.137 --> 03:27.310
uh, an arousing scent.

03:27.344 --> 03:29.000
Sounds like you were set up
to fail.

03:29.655 --> 03:32.000
Goodness. She made you stinky.

03:33.344 --> 03:35.310
Spray this on
and you'll never get a guy.

03:36.551 --> 03:40.310
Oh, my God! It's so strong!

03:40.344 --> 03:41.586
What?
Does it smell like new book?

03:41.620 --> 03:44.310
- No, my wrist.
- Oh, yeah, I was like...

03:44.344 --> 03:45.827
All I can smell.

03:45.862 --> 03:49.965
I smell like
a pumpkin spice latte.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.482
It is very uncomfortable
having my sister

03:52.517 --> 03:54.551
and my stepdad
drive me to a date.

03:54.586 --> 03:56.586
- You ready?
- No.

03:56.620 --> 03:58.586
- You got this.
- Totally.

03:58.620 --> 04:01.310
It is one of the reasons
that I want to start driving,

04:01.344 --> 04:03.379
<i>just so they</i> <i>
don't have to come along.</i>

04:03.413 --> 04:05.896
<i>And that way</i> <i>
I don't have to deal</i> <i>
with their nagging</i>

04:05.931 --> 04:07.689
<i>Or their making fun of me.</i>

04:07.724 --> 04:10.034
<i>Or even the fact</i> <i>
that they could stalk</i> <i>
the date.</i>

04:10.068 --> 04:13.689
But, at the end of the day,
I know it's out of love.

04:13.724 --> 04:15.896
And it is comforting.

04:15.931 --> 04:18.241
<i>-But I need to</i> <i>
learn how to drive.</i>
- Here we go.

04:20.068 --> 04:23.275
<i>I don't think</i> <i>
if Shauna could drive</i> <i>
we would tag along.</i>

04:23.310 --> 04:26.517
I'd be very tempted
to find out where she's going
and maybe like,

04:26.551 --> 04:28.517
Oh, I'm eating here too. Oh!

04:28.551 --> 04:30.379
What a surprise.

04:39.517 --> 04:43.000
But, you know that we're
not going home, we'll be...

04:45.413 --> 04:48.758
I was talking to Shauna.

04:48.793 --> 04:50.517
Do you know this guy's name
at least?

04:50.551 --> 04:54.482
I know nothing
but he lives in Yonkers
and doesn't have a car.

04:54.517 --> 04:58.827
With Shauna specifically
it's really difficult for me

04:58.862 --> 05:01.931
to let go of a lot of things.

05:01.965 --> 05:06.068
<i>And that might be</i> <i>
a hinderance for her.</i>

05:06.103 --> 05:10.931
Because I'm not willing to,
or ready, to let go.

05:10.965 --> 05:15.310
With such things as
her probably driving a car.

05:16.172 --> 05:17.689
Or her moving out.

05:17.724 --> 05:19.758
Dating.

05:19.793 --> 05:23.724
Um, all those moments
that she should have already
experienced.

05:24.827 --> 05:27.103
I'm still holding back on.

05:27.965 --> 05:29.275
So, yeah.

05:44.482 --> 05:46.896
You wanna give
the guy another strike?

05:48.137 --> 05:49.448
What happened? What?

05:49.482 --> 05:50.862
He cancelled.

05:50.896 --> 05:52.482
- Are you me?
- Yeah.

05:54.275 --> 05:57.827
While on my way
to the first date
the guy got cold feet.

05:57.862 --> 06:00.137
And the matchmaker
had to text me
that he cancelled.

06:01.206 --> 06:02.448
What a

06:03.344 --> 06:04.862
Ah!

06:04.896 --> 06:07.103
- Now what?
- Does he give a reason?

06:08.793 --> 06:11.758
<i>I was relieved</i> <i>
when he cancelled.</i>

06:11.793 --> 06:14.517
Him not having a car,

06:14.551 --> 06:18.103
not willing to come out to me,

06:18.137 --> 06:20.034
and me having to go
all the way out there,

06:20.068 --> 06:21.310
and then him cancelling.

06:21.344 --> 06:24.103
Just kinda showed
all of these characteristics

06:24.137 --> 06:26.275
that I don't want in a person
in my life.

06:27.241 --> 06:29.172
Wanna just go bowling anyhow?

06:29.206 --> 06:30.862
Rylee, you wanna go bowling?

06:33.068 --> 06:36.000
So I guess we're going bowling
cause Rylee likes bowling.

06:36.034 --> 06:39.137
Yeah, let's just do it.
Let's have some fun.

06:39.172 --> 06:40.344
- Okay.
- All right.

06:41.137 --> 06:42.206
So we're
going bowling.

06:45.517 --> 06:46.655
<i>When something</i> <i>
like that happens</i>

06:46.689 --> 06:49.034
<i>I think the best thing to do</i> <i>
is try to</i>

06:49.068 --> 06:51.655
<i>make the best</i> <i>
of a bad situation.</i>

06:51.689 --> 06:55.206
Once the guy backed out
we kind of were

06:55.241 --> 06:57.724
<i>like, you know, screw it</i> <i>
let just go bowling anyhow.</i>

06:58.551 --> 07:00.448
You know, screw him.
Three here.

07:03.586 --> 07:05.068
- Thirteen?
- Yeah, kids.

07:05.103 --> 07:07.551
My shoe size is a kids 13.

07:07.586 --> 07:10.965
I think it translates
to an adult two.

07:11.000 --> 07:17.068
<i>It's extremely complicated
finding shoes that fit my size
and my age.</i>

07:17.103 --> 07:20.034
Most children shoes
have some kind of

07:20.068 --> 07:21.724
cartoon character
on them somehow.

07:21.758 --> 07:24.827
<i>And if I'm perceiving my shoes</i> <i>
as looking like childish</i>

07:24.862 --> 07:26.551
then other people
are gonna perceive that.

07:26.586 --> 07:29.103
And then they're gonna
view me as a child in general.

07:29.137 --> 07:32.689
So, I probably overthink
the shoe thing
a little too much.

07:36.931 --> 07:38.344
That one's fine

07:39.620 --> 07:40.862
That's fine.

07:40.896 --> 07:43.862
<i>They do have kids</i> <i>
bowling balls.</i>

07:43.896 --> 07:46.034
But I don't want to
take those balls away

07:46.068 --> 07:50.034
from the kids
that actually need them
because they wanna bowl,

07:50.068 --> 07:51.965
'cause I don't care
about bowling.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.517
But, at the same time,
I need at least
one 5 pound ball.

07:55.551 --> 07:58.379
Because 6 pounds
can get too heavy.

07:58.413 --> 08:01.413
And 7 pounds
is just not gonna happen.

08:02.172 --> 08:04.517
All right, go ahead.

08:04.551 --> 08:07.000
We're all gonna suck.
It's gonna be great.

08:09.241 --> 08:11.655
Oh!
Gutter, gutter,
gutter, gutter, gutter.

08:12.724 --> 08:14.241
Three and four.

08:14.275 --> 08:16.931
Growing up I was not athletic.

08:16.965 --> 08:18.620
I didn't play any sports.

08:18.655 --> 08:22.862
<i>I did cheerleading,</i> <i>
I went horseback riding</i> <i>
via Girls Scouts.</i>

08:22.896 --> 08:25.344
<i>But when it comes to, like,</i> <i>
actual sport sports</i>

08:26.034 --> 08:27.310
They're not my cup of tea.

08:27.344 --> 08:29.310
<i>I've always been thin</i> <i>
and frail.</i>

08:29.344 --> 08:33.241
And I don't think my body
would've done well in sports
either way.

08:33.275 --> 08:37.482
- Gutter ball! Gutter ball!
- Happy?

08:37.517 --> 08:39.482
I did it. Just for you.

08:39.517 --> 08:40.827
Looking good, Rylee.

08:41.931 --> 08:43.137
Oh, Rylee!

08:44.103 --> 08:46.793
Look, look.

08:46.827 --> 08:50.931
You're probably
the best bowler even though
you think you suck.

08:55.586 --> 08:56.413
Gutter!

09:08.068 --> 09:09.206
Oh, that wasn't bad.

09:11.413 --> 09:13.724
My final score was a 39.

09:13.758 --> 09:15.551
Mine was a 61.

09:15.586 --> 09:17.379
And I was a 64.

09:17.413 --> 09:20.000
- Yeah, I lost by three points.
- Almost your age.

09:22.275 --> 09:23.896
I wonder
if there's a league
we could join?

09:24.827 --> 09:26.586
The worst league.

09:26.620 --> 09:29.724
- So can I take off
these very slippery shoes?
- Yes.

09:29.758 --> 09:34.586
I think we had fun, I mean,
I think we made the best
out of the situation.

09:34.620 --> 09:37.551
<i>Even though</i> <i>
it was supposed to be a date,</i>

09:37.586 --> 09:40.241
I probably enjoyed it better
this way,

09:40.275 --> 09:42.689
with my family
than I would have
with a complete stranger.

09:44.034 --> 09:47.034
<i>I'm still open</i> <i>
to the matchmaking situation,</i>

09:47.068 --> 09:49.724
it really depends on
if the second guy cancels.

09:49.758 --> 09:52.068
If I get another date
and he cancels,

09:52.103 --> 09:55.241
then I'm probably just gonna
throw all the matchmaking
out the window.

09:58.275 --> 09:59.655
- Are you excited?
- No.

09:59.689 --> 10:02.896
- Rude.
- Tara's making a quick trip
to Long Island

10:02.931 --> 10:05.344
so we can go
bridesmaid dress shopping.

10:05.379 --> 10:07.517
So this is
definitely going to be very,
very big.

10:07.551 --> 10:09.172
The boobs are too big.

10:10.862 --> 10:13.137
Shauna, everything is too big.

10:13.172 --> 10:16.241
- Not just the boobs.
- It's a mess. Nothing fits me.

10:28.034 --> 10:29.551
So what we
here for today?

10:29.586 --> 10:31.000
- Them.
- Them.

10:31.034 --> 10:32.620
Them, my bridesmaids.

10:32.655 --> 10:34.344
All right, very good,
very good.

10:34.379 --> 10:36.758
Tara's making a quick trip
to Long Island

10:36.793 --> 10:38.931
so we can go
bridesmaid dress shopping.

10:38.965 --> 10:43.137
<i>Given the fact that I can't do</i> <i>
online shopping really</i> <i>
because of my size</i>

10:43.172 --> 10:45.931
we're actually going to go
to a bridesmaid shop,

10:45.965 --> 10:49.793
to see what the dresses
look like on me and to see
if they can be altered.

10:49.827 --> 10:52.172
Do you have a color
that you're interested in?

10:52.206 --> 10:56.793
- So my plan for them
is to have blue dresses.
- Okay.

10:56.827 --> 11:00.000
- But I want them to have--
A degradation.

11:00.034 --> 11:04.172
A different color,
so it fades into white.

11:04.206 --> 11:07.655
This is Jesse
and he is my fiance.

11:07.689 --> 11:10.862
Jesse and I met while working
at a restaurant together.

11:10.896 --> 11:13.896
When I proposed to Tara,
we went to a park.

11:13.931 --> 11:17.862
We had a nice little trip
back home to Pittsburgh.

11:17.896 --> 11:21.068
Um, around the 4th of July,
which is one of her
favorite holidays.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.344
And I got down on one knee.

11:25.068 --> 11:26.758
- Just as awkward
as you're saying it.
- Showed her the ring.

11:26.793 --> 11:29.000
Just as awkward
as I'm saying it right now.

11:29.034 --> 11:30.862
<i>And she said yes.</i>

11:30.896 --> 11:31.931
<i>She didn't even</i> <i>
have to think about it.</i>

11:33.275 --> 11:35.379
Do we have ideas
of what you guys
are looking for?

11:35.413 --> 11:36.724
That's all you.

11:36.758 --> 11:40.689
No, I don't have anything.
I just had the colors in mind.

11:40.724 --> 11:42.413
And everything's
free-for-all.

11:42.448 --> 11:44.241
Do you want all of them
in the same dress?

11:45.172 --> 11:46.896
Or do you prefer
different dresses?

11:46.931 --> 11:48.344
That's a good question.

11:48.379 --> 11:51.241
It is
a very good question.

11:51.275 --> 11:55.482
As long as they're happy
with the dress that they're in
I don't care honestly.

11:55.517 --> 11:56.827
I don't have a preference.

11:56.862 --> 12:01.310
It's super hard
to find something
that all these girls like.

12:01.344 --> 12:03.586
<i>And are able to agree upon.</i>

12:03.620 --> 12:07.931
All of them are going in
with no opinions.

12:07.965 --> 12:09.655
But they all have opinions.

12:09.689 --> 12:11.379
And they're gonna show up
really quick.

12:11.413 --> 12:15.448
I would pick a few things
and just, you know,
try some stuff on.

12:15.482 --> 12:17.586
And let's see how it goes.

12:17.620 --> 12:20.206
First we're gonna
enjoy some refreshments.
What'd you think about that?

12:24.551 --> 12:26.275
Mom!

12:26.310 --> 12:29.482
My impression of Shauna
was that I didn't think
she was a child.

12:29.517 --> 12:31.448
Looking at her, yes,
she's little.

12:31.482 --> 12:33.586
Um, but I did not think
she was a child,

12:33.620 --> 12:37.137
I thought she was an adult
just smaller than us.

12:37.172 --> 12:39.034
She had a tattoo on her back.

12:39.068 --> 12:40.862
You know, so,
and her nails were done,

12:40.896 --> 12:43.379
all up, so I thought
that she was older.

12:43.413 --> 12:45.724
That's perfect Rylee.

12:46.241 --> 12:47.793
You get grape juice.

12:47.827 --> 12:49.586
That's her favorite.

12:50.310 --> 12:51.655
- Are you excited?
- No.

12:53.413 --> 12:54.241
Rude.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.275
No offence.

12:57.310 --> 13:01.724
I'm not exactly excited to go
bridesmaid dress shopping
with Tara.

13:01.758 --> 13:05.103
One, it might not be
very successful
with my height.

13:05.137 --> 13:07.103
But two, Tara and I
fight a lot.

13:07.137 --> 13:09.000
So, doing things with Tara

13:09.793 --> 13:11.689
makes me a little wishy-washy.

13:11.724 --> 13:14.448
- You're not excited for her?
- Sure.

13:15.172 --> 13:16.827
Sure.

13:16.862 --> 13:22.448
When I met Tara and Shauna
their relationship
was much more amenable.

13:22.482 --> 13:24.275
<i>They were very close.</i>

13:24.310 --> 13:26.689
<i>Um, but as they got older</i>

13:26.724 --> 13:30.551
<i>and especially after Tara</i> <i>
left high school.</i>

13:31.517 --> 13:34.827
it became very,
a lot more adversarial.

13:34.862 --> 13:39.620
And I think again
it's that Shauna
being jealous that

13:39.655 --> 13:41.034
Tara's living the life that

13:41.793 --> 13:43.448
she should be living also.

13:44.344 --> 13:46.206
Because of your height

13:46.655 --> 13:48.034
we could go,

13:48.068 --> 13:50.172
I have another manufacturer
that makes junior bridesmaids,

13:50.206 --> 13:52.206
that we could possible pick
from there.

13:52.241 --> 13:54.620
So, definitely find you
something to try on.

13:54.655 --> 13:56.965
Always extremely
intimidating shopping

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
in an area that you know
nothing's gonna fit, one.

13:59.034 --> 14:00.896
But two, just shopping
in general because,

14:02.379 --> 14:04.931
it's a mess,
nothing fits me in general.

14:04.965 --> 14:06.862
Okay, this one fits,
not at all.

14:08.413 --> 14:10.448
So this is
definitely going to be very,
very big.

14:10.482 --> 14:12.034
The boobs are too big.

14:13.758 --> 14:15.896
Shauna, everything is too big.

14:15.931 --> 14:17.448
It's not just the boobs.

14:18.586 --> 14:21.068
The boobs feel like
a breastplate.

14:21.103 --> 14:23.413
- All right,
let it go for one second.
- Some armor.

14:24.206 --> 14:25.758
<i>I like dresses.</i>

14:25.793 --> 14:28.758
I think, like,
adult style dresses

14:28.793 --> 14:31.275
you don't ever see them
in children sizes, one.

14:31.310 --> 14:33.758
But two, I've never actually
seen them on my body.

14:34.724 --> 14:36.931
So it's just
an uncomfortable feeling.

14:37.344 --> 14:38.172
You good?

14:39.275 --> 14:41.379
All right, step up.

14:41.413 --> 14:44.275
Hold on, honey. Let's fix ya.
Okay, hold on,
take your arm out of here.

14:44.310 --> 14:47.275
That actually does not look
as bad as I thought it was
going to.

14:47.310 --> 14:50.517
I feel like this is slipping
underneath though.

14:50.551 --> 14:52.586
Shauna was using
the hanger straps.

14:52.620 --> 14:55.862
Well, because it keeps
the other part up.

14:55.896 --> 14:58.517
<i>The junior size dress</i> <i>
at the bridesmaid shop</i>

14:58.551 --> 15:00.689
<i>was supposed to</i> <i>
kinda fit my body.</i>

15:01.275 --> 15:02.206
It still didn't.

15:02.241 --> 15:05.275
I still didn't have
the boob area for it.

15:05.310 --> 15:07.137
You can see all of this.

15:07.172 --> 15:09.413
- I'll fix that for you.

15:09.448 --> 15:11.000
You sure?
That's all of your boobs.

15:11.034 --> 15:12.448
All right, let's see.

15:12.482 --> 15:14.275
<i>I started sewing</i> <i>
my own stuff</i>

15:15.034 --> 15:16.827
I think when I was 16.

15:16.862 --> 15:20.137
Because I wanted to actually
have clothes of my own.

15:20.172 --> 15:24.068
<i>But finding clothing</i> <i>
in the adult section</i>

15:24.103 --> 15:26.586
<i>and actually making it work</i> <i>
to my size</i>

15:26.620 --> 15:29.000
when it's already made,
taking it apart,

15:29.034 --> 15:30.793
ruins the fabric.

15:30.827 --> 15:32.655
And you should just
start it from scratch.

15:32.689 --> 15:35.586
I think it depends
on what's in the store.

15:35.620 --> 15:39.103
<i>And then I decide</i> <i>
by looking at it,</i> <i>
if I like it,</i>

15:39.137 --> 15:41.793
whether I can alter it or not.
And if I can't I leave it.

15:41.827 --> 15:43.172
I like
that style dress.

15:43.206 --> 15:44.827
- This looks pretty.
Yeah,
it's very pretty.

15:44.862 --> 15:47.344
- What do you think?
- Yeah, is it comfortable?

15:47.379 --> 15:49.241
I really don't care
what I look like.

15:49.275 --> 15:51.517
You don't care
what you look like?
- No, not really.

15:51.551 --> 15:54.000
I need
some kind of feedback

15:54.034 --> 15:56.655
- That's what Mom's here for.
- I think that would
look good on Rylee.

15:56.689 --> 15:59.241
- Ah, hi.
Hi.

15:59.275 --> 16:01.034
I don't like that style dress.

16:02.724 --> 16:05.000
I don't care if you like it.

16:05.034 --> 16:07.206
- What do we think
of the color?
- The color's good.

16:07.241 --> 16:09.551
Okay.
<i>She's a tomboy.</i>

16:09.586 --> 16:13.137
She will not wear a dress
if she does not have to.

16:13.172 --> 16:15.241
- Who would?
- Me.

16:16.068 --> 16:16.931
I look pretty.

16:20.034 --> 16:21.413
They will not be
in the wedding.

16:21.448 --> 16:23.896
I was like,
do I have to step?
- That will not happen.

16:24.896 --> 16:26.620
Hey, I can't wear
my combat boots?

16:26.655 --> 16:28.206
There will be no combat boots.

16:28.241 --> 16:29.758
It will be on the invitation.

16:29.793 --> 16:33.137
- Will you even see them?
- Yes, she has a slit!

16:35.862 --> 16:38.344
There will be no combat boots
allowed at this wedding.

16:39.068 --> 16:39.965
Bye-bye.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.517
That dress is a winner.

16:41.551 --> 16:45.517
- Do you, honestly?
- It's fine.
It's long, but it's fine.

16:45.551 --> 16:47.448
Well, I know,
but is it comfortable?

16:47.482 --> 16:48.379
This is the

16:49.724 --> 16:51.310
- Same one?
- Same one.

16:51.344 --> 16:52.965
Just in a bigger size.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.379
I'd like to see Rylee in that.

16:54.413 --> 16:56.517
Rylee can you actually
try this one on, honey.

16:56.551 --> 16:59.758
All right honey, there ya go.
You're welcome.
Yell if you need help, okay.

17:01.586 --> 17:04.724
They unzipped her,
I don't know if that would
have been necessary.

17:06.344 --> 17:08.586
So, I had some champagne.

17:09.689 --> 17:11.793
- A little bit.
- A lot of champagne.

17:11.827 --> 17:13.758
No, you think
you had a little bit.

17:13.793 --> 17:17.965
Because you were
taking everybody else's
before yours

17:18.000 --> 17:20.137
and then they were
just refilling it.

17:20.172 --> 17:24.793
Well when somebody's refilling
you just don't know how much
you've actually had.

17:24.827 --> 17:27.103
And, you know, it was there.

17:27.137 --> 17:28.793
It was there.

17:28.827 --> 17:30.379
- And you were drinking it.
- I drank it.

17:33.931 --> 17:35.448
Oh! Ew!

17:35.482 --> 17:38.482
TMI, I am your daughter still.

17:39.068 --> 17:40.448
Holy cow.

17:40.482 --> 17:42.068
- I forgot
who I was talking to.
- Yeah.

17:42.103 --> 17:43.482
Yeah, I'm not a friend.

17:44.965 --> 17:46.620
Phone a friend.

17:46.655 --> 17:49.310
I think you've had at least
five now.

17:50.103 --> 17:51.310
I don't know about that.

17:51.344 --> 17:52.586
So, I think two.

17:53.827 --> 17:56.241
- Two is spicy.
- Two is spicy.
And then four is

17:56.793 --> 17:57.793
spicy.

17:59.689 --> 18:02.172
So have we come
to an agreement
with this dress?

18:02.206 --> 18:03.206
It's your wedding.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.137
All of a sudden.

18:05.172 --> 18:07.379
I'm comfortable. I'm fine.

18:07.413 --> 18:09.655
- If you want it, this is fine.
- Slit and pockets.

18:09.689 --> 18:10.724
Slit and pockets.

18:10.758 --> 18:12.758
At the end
of bridesmaid shopping

18:12.793 --> 18:14.620
Tara decided
that every bridesmaid

18:14.655 --> 18:18.034
was gonna have a different
shade of blue for their dress.

18:18.068 --> 18:23.275
And, Rylee and I convinced her
to get pockets and a slit.

18:23.310 --> 18:24.517
Can I wear my combat boots?

18:24.551 --> 18:25.689
No.

18:26.068 --> 18:27.517
Sorry.

18:27.551 --> 18:31.758
Definitely glad
we got to check the bridesmaid
dresses off the list.

18:31.793 --> 18:34.034
Cause that is one thing.

18:34.068 --> 18:36.655
I think that was a big thing.

18:36.689 --> 18:38.000
Yeah, it's a big thing.

18:38.034 --> 18:40.137
- Thank you.
- Should we cheers?

18:42.206 --> 18:44.206
- Cool, I got you.
- Thanks.

18:45.206 --> 18:48.000
Rylee won
the title of maid of honor.

18:48.724 --> 18:50.724
Um, there wasn't a fight.

18:57.241 --> 19:00.344
I'm gonna change the wording.
It's my privilege.

19:02.793 --> 19:05.068
I just have to
let you know
there is an age requirement.

19:05.103 --> 19:06.689
Thirteen with an adult.

19:06.724 --> 19:08.620
Mark and I
were going to go to a gym.

19:08.655 --> 19:11.758
Her being this size,
is it going to be an issue?

19:11.793 --> 19:14.068
And then you have the people
that just stare at you,

19:14.103 --> 19:16.896
<i>"Oh, my God!</i> <i>
She's so cute!</i> <i>
Look at her do that!"</i>

19:16.931 --> 19:17.793
I don't want that.

19:27.620 --> 19:28.758
Hi, guys.

19:28.793 --> 19:29.827
Hi.
- How are ya?

19:29.862 --> 19:31.620
- Good, how are you?
- Good, thank you.

19:31.655 --> 19:32.689
What can I help you
with today?

19:32.724 --> 19:35.310
- We're--
- He needs to lose weight.

19:35.344 --> 19:38.241
Yeah, we just wanted
to check out the gym,
see what's going on.

19:38.275 --> 19:41.586
<i>So, Mark and I</i> <i>
both want to change</i> <i>
our bodies.</i>

19:41.620 --> 19:44.758
So we're going to go to a gym
and work out together.

19:44.793 --> 19:46.000
They're gonna see
if they can stretch her.

19:48.551 --> 19:49.965
They're gonna
give you hair, too.

19:51.517 --> 19:52.896
All right, so you guys
looking to sign up?

19:52.931 --> 19:54.344
Yeah, I think so, yeah.

19:54.379 --> 19:56.482
I just have to let you know
there is an age requirement.

19:56.517 --> 19:59.655
- Thirteen with an adult
and 14--
- I'm 22.

19:59.689 --> 20:01.724
I don't have my ID
but I can get my phone

20:01.758 --> 20:03.655
and show you
my excelsior pass.

20:03.689 --> 20:05.517
- Um, that's okay.
- Okay.

20:05.551 --> 20:07.275
We just need to have you
fill out this iPad, please.

20:07.310 --> 20:09.448
So I can get you guys started
with a trainer.

20:09.482 --> 20:10.862
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah, that's all you.

20:11.965 --> 20:14.034
<i>When Shauna</i> <i>
and her Dad walked in,</i>

20:14.068 --> 20:18.482
I thought she was probably
about seven, eight years old.

20:18.517 --> 20:20.965
I was really shocked
to hear that she was 22.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.758
<i>I've never seen</i> <i>
anybody like Shauna come into</i> <i>
the gym and work out.</i>

20:24.793 --> 20:26.586
Today was the first time.

20:26.620 --> 20:30.620
<i>Any gym you go to</i> <i>
has usually</i> <i>
an age requirement.</i>

20:30.655 --> 20:32.965
And I've experienced it
multiple times,

20:33.000 --> 20:35.137
it's one of the reasons
I don't go to gyms.

20:35.172 --> 20:38.827
<i>And to prove my age
sometimes I just open my mouth</i>

20:38.862 --> 20:40.241
and that'll get them
to go away.

20:40.275 --> 20:42.827
I've had to show someone
I had a tattoo once.

20:42.862 --> 20:46.724
<i>I've had people</i> <i>
ask me for my ID,</i> <i>
it's annoying, yes.</i>

20:46.758 --> 20:48.241
<i>And I try to get through it.</i>

20:48.275 --> 20:52.172
It's a weird situation,
it makes me uncomfortable
from the beginning.

20:52.206 --> 20:54.344
<i>Because I'm not</i> <i>
the only person</i> <i>
with a disability</i>

20:54.379 --> 20:55.931
<i>that goes to a gym.</i>

20:55.965 --> 20:59.655
And I hate to say it, but,
if someone in a wheelchair
or something walked in

20:59.689 --> 21:01.172
you would not question them.

21:01.206 --> 21:04.793
And just because I look
the way I look,
you question it.

21:04.827 --> 21:06.586
And that bothers me.

21:06.620 --> 21:08.413
I need to know
all of the health issues.

21:08.448 --> 21:10.655
You know,
is there anything right now

21:10.689 --> 21:13.172
which completely can stop you
from exercise?

21:13.206 --> 21:16.034
Is a doctor telling you
that you can't exercise
for any specific reason?

21:16.068 --> 21:18.137
No, they tell me
I need to exercise.

21:18.172 --> 21:20.724
There we go.
That's why we're here, right.

21:20.758 --> 21:22.724
So that I can definitely
help you with.

21:22.758 --> 21:27.689
Mark is the only reason
I have decided to actually
go through with

21:27.724 --> 21:30.034
actually looking at a gym
or anything.

21:30.068 --> 21:32.344
Because I can work
on my health at home.

21:32.379 --> 21:35.344
I know I have that ability.
He does not.

21:35.379 --> 21:37.896
He needs someone to push him.

21:37.931 --> 21:40.724
So, that person
is a trainer at a gym.

21:40.758 --> 21:42.758
So we're doing
weight loss.
- Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah.

21:42.793 --> 21:47.586
Yeah, I mean, I think
right now, the main goal
would be to fit

21:47.620 --> 21:50.241
into clothes that I wasn't
willing to throw out

21:50.275 --> 21:52.172
because I thought
this was gonna be temporary.

21:52.206 --> 21:55.310
- Yeah.
- And it became more permanent
than I expected it.

21:55.344 --> 21:58.551
- That's okay.
- Yeah, if I can fit those,

21:58.586 --> 22:01.931
- then I know I'm making
some progress.
- Absolutely.

22:01.965 --> 22:04.068
<i>I was a long distance</i> <i>
runner all throughout</i> <i>
high school.</i>

22:04.103 --> 22:07.068
And when I graduated
high school, I weighed
135 pounds.

22:07.103 --> 22:12.655
<i>But right around 2001,</i> <i>
after Patty and I met,</i> <i>
I gained, like, 30 pounds.</i>

22:12.689 --> 22:14.965
Eh, it just starts
creeping up on you,

22:15.000 --> 22:18.551
but my weight really
started taking off

22:18.586 --> 22:22.103
<i>when I had diverticulitis</i> <i>
surgery eight years ago.</i>

22:22.137 --> 22:25.931
<i>And then, two years later,</i> <i>
I had an obstructed</i> <i>
hernia surgery,</i>

22:25.965 --> 22:29.620
so kind of just get
into a sedentary lifestyle

22:29.655 --> 22:31.586
and it just kind of, uh,
becomes a habit.

22:31.620 --> 22:33.448
I gained about 100 pounds.

22:33.482 --> 22:35.620
<i>I look at Mark</i> <i>
and my relationship</i>

22:35.655 --> 22:39.931
almost kind of like a child
who is taking care
of the elderly parent now.

22:39.965 --> 22:42.103
He took care of me
when I went through
my chemo

22:42.137 --> 22:47.793
and my whole cancer trip,
like, it's not, like I owe it
to him.

22:47.827 --> 22:51.275
I'm... I'm giving it
back to him.

22:51.310 --> 22:56.310
Because I almost lost my life
and he wasn't there for that,

22:56.344 --> 23:00.620
but he helped me
have the life I can have now.

23:00.655 --> 23:05.448
There's so many things
in my life and Tara's life
and Rylee's life

23:05.482 --> 23:09.758
that he hasn't seen
and if he continues eating
the way he does,

23:09.793 --> 23:10.827
he won't see them.

23:10.862 --> 23:13.896
Her being this size,
is that gonna be an issue?

23:13.931 --> 23:18.655
There are machines
that tend to be a little bit
bigger for specific people.

23:18.689 --> 23:22.448
Women, in general, honestly,
I don't put us
on too many machines

23:22.482 --> 23:25.034
- because, um, I'm 5 foot.

23:25.068 --> 23:26.344
And I don't fit
on a lot of them.

23:26.379 --> 23:30.137
Specifically, for me,
I like to use, you know,
weight training,

23:30.172 --> 23:32.241
resistance training,
just throughout the floor.

23:32.275 --> 23:34.448
<i>There were</i> <i>
e a couple of things</i> <i>
that she was questioning</i>

23:34.482 --> 23:36.000
<i>that I might not</i> <i>
be able to do.</i>

23:36.034 --> 23:39.931
But most of the things
she said are,
in some way, accommodable.

23:39.965 --> 23:43.655
So hearing that
for the first time was nice.

23:43.689 --> 23:48.517
So do we feel like we're up
to a little bit of exercise
right now?

23:48.551 --> 23:50.793
- It's on you.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

23:50.827 --> 23:51.724
- Sure.
- All right. Good.

23:53.379 --> 23:56.034
First thing I wanna do
with you guys are box squats.

23:56.068 --> 23:59.137
Feet are about shoulder width,
if not a little bit
further apart.

23:59.172 --> 24:02.103
Sit back, core nice and tight,
you're gonna tap the box.

24:02.137 --> 24:06.586
After you tap the box,
you're gonna come directly up,
pushing through those heels.

24:07.689 --> 24:09.000
Good. One.

24:11.137 --> 24:12.551
Two. Pretty good form. Good.

24:13.068 --> 24:15.448
Three. Good. Four.

24:15.482 --> 24:18.689
<i>I don't like gyms</i> <i>
because they're judgmental.</i>

24:18.724 --> 24:21.448
They always say no judgment,
but the minute
I walk in, they're,

24:21.482 --> 24:23.551
"Oh, are you above 13?"

24:23.586 --> 24:26.793
No, like, does that matter?
Of course, I'm an adult.

24:26.827 --> 24:30.241
<i>And then you have the people</i> <i>
who just stare at you</i> <i>
and stare at you.</i>

24:30.275 --> 24:33.586
<i>And even, like, if we go</i> <i>
to the gym, I bet you</i> <i>
we'll get comments be like,</i>

24:33.620 --> 24:37.517
"Oh, my gosh. She's so cute.
Look at her do that."
I don't want that.

24:37.551 --> 24:39.413
Okay, six
on each leg.

24:39.448 --> 24:41.896
Inhale, exhale, bicep curl.
Good.

24:41.931 --> 24:44.793
Back down. Good.
Switch. Exhale.

24:45.965 --> 24:49.620
Good, that's one. Awesome.
Good. One.

24:49.655 --> 24:51.344
Remember, all the way up,
exhale down.

24:51.379 --> 24:53.758
- Two. Good.

24:53.793 --> 24:55.517
Three, four,

24:56.068 --> 24:58.448
five, six, seven,

24:59.241 --> 25:02.965
eight, nine, 10,
final 10 here.

25:04.827 --> 25:06.310
No.

25:07.034 --> 25:08.000
<i>No, I mean--</i>

25:08.034 --> 25:09.965
<i>You don't want</i> <i>
any big juice heads?</i>

25:10.000 --> 25:12.586
No, I'm not attracted
to gym nuts, like...

25:13.965 --> 25:15.896
I don't like all the noises
they make.

25:17.586 --> 25:19.172
That one guy was funny.

25:23.103 --> 25:24.896
He's trying to pass a stone.

25:27.379 --> 25:30.344
I'm still waiting
on the matchmaker to match me
with the second guy

25:30.379 --> 25:31.931
I'm supposed to go
on a date with.

25:31.965 --> 25:37.137
<i>I don't have an issue</i> <i>
with being set up</i> <i>
on a blind date with a jock.</i>

25:37.172 --> 25:39.517
Like a football player
or a baseball player,

25:39.551 --> 25:41.827
I mean, football I hate,
I hate football.

25:41.862 --> 25:44.896
So there's
no common ground.

25:44.931 --> 25:47.448
- Killed it. Killed it.
- Thank you.

25:47.482 --> 25:48.586
Way to work.

25:49.448 --> 25:51.413
We did it. Awesome job there.

25:51.448 --> 25:52.758
Take a sec, obviously.

25:52.793 --> 25:54.517
Walk your heartrate off.

25:54.551 --> 25:56.172
- They kicked butt.

25:56.206 --> 25:59.931
They came in here a little bit
nervous, um, just like most
people are.

25:59.965 --> 26:04.379
<i>And really just to see them</i> <i>
laugh and, you know, finish</i> <i>
their workout,</i>

26:04.413 --> 26:07.344
they did awesome
and I was very, very happy
with it.

26:07.379 --> 26:09.827
- You guys did an awesome job,
I'm so, so proud of you.
- Thanks.

26:09.862 --> 26:11.689
- Thank you.
- Very, very happy with that.

26:11.724 --> 26:14.172
- Dad did really awesome,
so did you.
- Thank you.

26:14.206 --> 26:15.310
Right?

26:15.344 --> 26:16.896
<i>It was really good.</i> <i>
I think for both of us.</i>

26:16.931 --> 26:18.896
<i>I'm actually pleased</i> <i>
with what I was able to do.</i>

26:18.931 --> 26:21.689
I wanted to push myself,
she pushed me even further.

26:21.724 --> 26:23.551
This one pushed me
even further.

26:23.586 --> 26:26.689
And, you know, I actually
am hoping that we come
back together.

26:26.724 --> 26:28.620
<i>I actually enjoyed us</i> <i>
doing this together.</i>

26:28.655 --> 26:30.310
Okay.

26:30.344 --> 26:32.379
I'll come back with you
if that's what I have to do.

26:38.586 --> 26:39.965
What do you know
about this dude?

26:40.000 --> 26:41.034
You don't know what he does?

26:41.068 --> 26:43.379
I'm going
on a second blind date.

26:43.413 --> 26:45.586
- Good luck.
Shut up.

26:45.620 --> 26:49.206
The only thing I know
about this guy is his name.

26:49.241 --> 26:52.034
I'm being very open-minded,
but at the same time,

26:52.068 --> 26:54.241
if it goes bad,
I have a weapon.

27:03.758 --> 27:05.862
Come on.
Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop,
bop, bop, bop.

27:09.586 --> 27:13.206
- We are a very
animal-friendly house.
- Yes.

27:13.241 --> 27:15.206
We all really like animals.

27:15.241 --> 27:17.310
Sahara, play nice.

27:17.344 --> 27:22.965
We have five dogs.
We have Nova, Koda,
Sahara, Chica and Una.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.068
This is Nova.

27:25.862 --> 27:27.068
<i>Nova is the oldest.</i>

27:27.103 --> 27:31.068
And she has
a vindictive personality.

27:31.103 --> 27:33.310
<i>This one is Sahara.</i>

27:33.344 --> 27:35.206
<i>She's just very protective.</i>

27:35.241 --> 27:37.000
<i>This is Koda.</i>

27:37.034 --> 27:39.724
Nova was first and Nova
was rough with Patty
and the girls.

27:39.758 --> 27:41.586
So I was like, "Ah,
we need another dog."

27:41.620 --> 27:43.413
<i>Then I came home</i> <i>
with two dogs.</i>

27:43.448 --> 27:45.068
<i>Koda and Sahara.</i>

27:45.103 --> 27:49.000
And then during the pandemic,
the quarantine part of it,

27:49.862 --> 27:52.482
- Nova and Koda...
- Got together.

27:52.517 --> 27:54.758
<i>So we kept</i> <i>
two babies.</i>

27:54.793 --> 27:57.275
And I think
it was the dumbest decision,
but I love them to death.

27:57.310 --> 27:58.172
Five dogs.

27:58.689 --> 27:59.620
And that's five.

27:59.655 --> 28:02.448
Una, patience.

28:02.482 --> 28:05.241
<i>We're gonna take</i> <i>
the dogs to a beach dog park</i>

28:05.275 --> 28:07.758
but we're just gonna take
Nova and the babies.

28:07.793 --> 28:11.793
<i>I'm only 50 pounds.</i> <i>
They're like 60, 75 pounds.</i>

28:11.827 --> 28:15.551
If all of them come at me
at once, I may go down.

28:15.586 --> 28:16.965
She has something in her ear.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.275
Does she?
- Yeah.

28:18.310 --> 28:20.000
It's, like, slobber
or something,

28:20.034 --> 28:22.551
but I don't want her to get
another ear infection.

28:22.586 --> 28:27.620
- Shauna and Rylee both aspire
to work in the animal field.
- With animals.

28:27.655 --> 28:28.896
Yeah, with animals.

28:28.931 --> 28:31.448
Shauna wanted to be a vet.

28:31.482 --> 28:33.724
And Rylee just wants
to train them.

28:33.758 --> 28:36.068
Okay, okay.
Slow. Slow.

28:36.103 --> 28:37.862
She thinks she can train dogs.

28:44.241 --> 28:45.310
Come on. Hey.

28:46.172 --> 28:48.310
Good girl, Chica.

28:48.344 --> 28:49.793
- Yes.
Stay.

28:49.827 --> 28:52.068
Oh, oh, oh!
You just smashed Una.

28:52.103 --> 28:53.275
Nope.
She's fine.

29:02.310 --> 29:04.344
All right, well I guess
we gotta get...

29:04.379 --> 29:06.793
- You good?
- Yup, we gotta get
these guys out.

29:06.827 --> 29:07.724
All right. Stay.

29:09.344 --> 29:11.724
We'll just try to get 'em out.
Watch out,
right behind you, Rylee!

29:11.758 --> 29:14.620
See, this is why--
All right, grab her...
Okay. I got her.

29:16.206 --> 29:17.551
All right.
And I got her.

29:19.551 --> 29:20.448
Shauna.

29:22.241 --> 29:23.724
Rylee, why do you need
to switch?

29:24.758 --> 29:28.310
The dogs are big
and they're so smart

29:28.344 --> 29:30.275
and they know how
to get out of their harnesses.

29:30.310 --> 29:31.724
<i>Yeah, so if they see</i> <i>
something,</i>

29:31.758 --> 29:34.551
like, if Sahara
sees a deer and she wants
that deer,

29:34.586 --> 29:35.758
- she will get out.
- Book it.

29:35.793 --> 29:36.655
What's this?

29:38.068 --> 29:40.482
- What's this?
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

29:40.517 --> 29:42.655
You have it.
Go, go, go.

29:45.724 --> 29:47.206
- Una!

29:48.000 --> 29:49.344
Well, that's cold.

29:49.379 --> 29:53.000
- Nope.
I don't wanna go
that far in, Un.

29:53.034 --> 29:55.827
I've wanted to be a vet
since I was, like, four.

29:55.862 --> 29:57.862
<i>It's always been</i> <i>
one of my goals,</i>

29:57.896 --> 30:00.379
<i>still wanna go to college,</i> <i>
still wanna go</i> <i>
to vet school.</i>

30:00.413 --> 30:05.896
The thing that stopped me
the most is I've wanted
to work, like, a specialized

30:05.931 --> 30:10.724
- kind of variety, like zoology
or like farm animals.
- Farm animals.

30:10.758 --> 30:14.724
And for that, you kind of
do need to be on the larger
size of the human scale

30:14.758 --> 30:18.344
because the birthing process
for horses or cows,

30:18.379 --> 30:22.137
it usually takes two
to three large sized people

30:22.172 --> 30:24.827
and for me, it'd be like...

30:25.689 --> 30:26.965
I'm half a human.

30:28.517 --> 30:30.965
Shaun, do you wanna
walk down here or you wanna
stay on the beach?

30:31.000 --> 30:32.482
We can do whatever.

30:32.517 --> 30:35.034
<i>I think the smaller</i> <i>
girl, probably about eight</i> <i>
years old,</i>

30:35.068 --> 30:37.724
<i>had a little bit more</i> <i>
of a hard time, the dog</i> <i>
was pulling her a little bit.</i>

30:42.310 --> 30:43.689
Yeah.

30:44.793 --> 30:45.965
- Wow.
- Wow.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.034
I mean, I wasn't really
looking that close,

30:48.068 --> 30:53.344
but yeah, that would,
uh, that would be, uh, yeah,
that would be eye opening.

30:58.172 --> 31:01.344
I think in order
to be completely independent,

31:01.379 --> 31:04.034
I need to drive,
I need my own job.

31:04.068 --> 31:06.241
I can be a vet
that has my own assistant,

31:06.275 --> 31:10.275
but it's hard for me
to not wanna do it myself.

31:10.310 --> 31:12.551
I've always thought, like,
I can do it myself

31:12.586 --> 31:14.482
'cause I always thought
I was gonna be taller,

31:14.517 --> 31:17.965
so I never really imagined
working with larger animals
in the body I'm in.

31:18.000 --> 31:20.896
So I'm going to see
if I can find a farm
with large animals,

31:20.931 --> 31:22.758
so I can get some experience.

31:22.793 --> 31:24.689
Una, why are you growling
at them?

31:24.724 --> 31:26.379
- They're bigger than you.
Una.

31:35.103 --> 31:37.551
<i>So today, I am going</i> <i>
on a second blind date</i>

31:37.586 --> 31:40.448
<i>that was set up</i> <i>
by Gabby the matchmaker.</i>

31:40.482 --> 31:44.724
My first blind date,
um, I don't know if they got
cold feet or whatever,

31:44.758 --> 31:46.931
but they cancelled,
so it didn't happen.

31:50.137 --> 31:51.896
Scooby-Doo.

31:51.931 --> 31:56.068
<i>As I'm getting ready,</i> <i>
I do try not to think</i> <i>
about what I'm about to do.</i>

31:56.103 --> 31:59.793
<i>Just because I have</i> <i>
really bad anxiety sometimes</i> <i>
and I don't wanna</i>

31:59.827 --> 32:01.482
<i>cause myself</i> <i>
to have a panic attack.</i>

32:01.517 --> 32:04.965
Because if I get cancelled
again, I'm done.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.931
Yeah, I mean,
what do you know
about this dude?

32:06.965 --> 32:08.551
I know
his name is Abraham.

32:08.586 --> 32:11.310
But you don't know
anything else about him, like,
you don't know what he does?

32:11.344 --> 32:12.620
- No.
- Does he do...

32:12.655 --> 32:17.000
I believe that the matchmaker
let my date know
about my size

32:17.034 --> 32:19.206
and about what caused my size.

32:19.241 --> 32:23.758
I knew one of their names,
so they definitely went in
with more information.

32:23.793 --> 32:24.655
That's not fair.

32:31.310 --> 32:33.620
<i>We're going</i> <i>
to axe throwing.</i>

32:33.655 --> 32:35.413
Oh, that's it.

32:35.448 --> 32:37.482
<i>I'm trying to go</i> <i>
into it with an open heart</i>

32:37.517 --> 32:40.965
and I'm being very
open-minded,
but at the same time,

32:41.000 --> 32:43.172
if it goes bad,
I have a weapon.

32:45.551 --> 32:47.655
- Get out.
Shut up.

32:47.689 --> 32:49.413
- Good luck.
Shut up.

32:58.517 --> 33:01.413
The only thing I know
about this guy is his name.

33:03.206 --> 33:06.172
<i>I have no other information.</i>

33:06.206 --> 33:09.379
So, um, right now,
I'm very nervous.

33:19.827 --> 33:22.620
Gabby the matchmaker
has set me up
on a second blind date

33:22.655 --> 33:25.620
and this afternoon
I'm going to meet him.

33:25.655 --> 33:30.344
<i>I wanted them</i> <i>
to be blind dates, um,</i> <i>
specifically on my end</i>

33:30.379 --> 33:34.655
because there's a lot
of judgment in people's faces
when they first see me.

33:34.689 --> 33:38.103
So having it blind,
having him not know
what I look like,

33:38.137 --> 33:42.482
changes it,
it makes it a little
more real.

33:52.241 --> 33:53.827
- Hi, I'm Shauna.
- Hi, Shauna.

33:53.862 --> 33:55.482
- How you doing? Abraham.
- Good, how are you?

33:55.517 --> 33:57.896
- Nice to meet you.
- You don't look
like an Abraham.

33:57.931 --> 33:59.068
What do I look like?

33:59.103 --> 34:00.586
I don't know,
but not an Abraham.

34:00.620 --> 34:04.034
- Well, give me a hug.
- A hug? You want a hug?

34:04.068 --> 34:05.103
- Yes.
- Oh, you're tall.

34:05.137 --> 34:08.655
I don't like hugs.
I hate hugs.

34:08.689 --> 34:10.724
No one knows how to hug
a short person.

34:10.758 --> 34:14.655
I legit despise
when people try to hug me.

34:14.689 --> 34:16.551
I'm very thankful
to be here right now.

34:16.586 --> 34:22.000
I mean, he dealt with it
the best way he could
and respect to him for that.

34:22.034 --> 34:23.862
Still don't like hugs.

34:23.896 --> 34:26.000
Yeah, come on.
- Can I sit? Okay.

34:26.034 --> 34:28.517
Honestly, I was a little
surprised and I was, like,

34:28.551 --> 34:31.689
all right, let me just,
you know, keep
myself contained

34:31.724 --> 34:36.448
'cause I thought that I was,
you know, being punked
or something at first.

34:36.482 --> 34:38.344
<i>I did get a little background.</i>

34:38.379 --> 34:41.344
I was told that she had,
like, a form of cancer

34:41.379 --> 34:45.620
and that it may have, like,
affected her growth a little.

34:45.655 --> 34:47.482
I tried not to hear
too much more,

34:47.517 --> 34:50.862
I just want to come into this
with no expectations
and just have a good time.

34:54.034 --> 34:57.517
He was a good looking guy,
he was nice, um...

34:59.517 --> 35:02.862
But, yeah, my first impression
was he's tall.

35:02.896 --> 35:06.068
You came into this
knowing things about me.

35:06.103 --> 35:08.551
- I'm completely blind, so.
- Yes, yes.

35:08.586 --> 35:10.068
You owe me two things.

35:10.103 --> 35:15.103
So, one thing about me is,
like, picking this one
location, I noticed

35:15.137 --> 35:17.034
- that this was a high school
right here.
- Mmm-hmm.

35:17.068 --> 35:20.379
That I actually played,
like, I played
against this high school.

35:20.413 --> 35:22.241
- Oh, you've played
against them.
- In football.

35:22.275 --> 35:24.724
So when I noticed this
over here... That's one thing
I wanna let you know

35:24.758 --> 35:27.068
- is that I played football.
- Yeah, you're a football
player.

35:27.103 --> 35:31.034
I didn't care that Abraham
was an ex-football player.

35:31.068 --> 35:32.275
I don't care for football.

35:32.310 --> 35:34.517
<i>He didn't come off</i> <i>
as a juice head.</i>

35:34.551 --> 35:37.517
<i>He came off very spiritual,</i> <i>
which was a good thing</i> <i>
for him</i>

35:37.551 --> 35:40.551
<i>because if he came off</i> <i>
as a juice head,</i>

35:40.586 --> 35:42.896
I don't know how long
I would've lasted.

35:42.931 --> 35:44.931
Is it an issue
that I'm from Pittsburg?

35:44.965 --> 35:46.620
- And I'm a Steelers fan?
- No, no, no, no, no.

35:46.655 --> 35:49.896
- Okay. In sports teams?
- I have no emotions
involved no more.

35:49.931 --> 35:52.275
Yeah, like, the Giants
have broke my heart.

35:52.310 --> 35:53.689
Oh, so you were a Giants fan.

35:53.724 --> 35:56.758
- Yes, and, uh--
- Well, you picked
the wrong team.

35:56.793 --> 35:58.517
Well...

35:58.551 --> 36:00.931
<i>I will say that I was</i> <i>
standoff-ish towards Abraham</i> <i>
in the beginning.</i>

36:00.965 --> 36:04.310
And that's just
because my trust issues
are through the roof.

36:04.344 --> 36:06.655
My walls are,
like, 100-feet tall

36:06.689 --> 36:08.655
because I've been used a lot.

36:08.689 --> 36:11.137
And I've been used
for dumb reasons.

36:11.172 --> 36:18.000
And... he's still in that area
of is he using me
or is he not?

36:18.034 --> 36:22.827
- That's a lot of pizza.
- Yes, I actually am probably
gonna have one or two slices.

36:22.862 --> 36:24.517
I don't know if you were

36:24.551 --> 36:26.448
- a pizza person.
- I mean, I can have one.

36:26.482 --> 36:29.275
- Yes, I'll probably enjoy
them with you.
- I might even eat two.

36:29.310 --> 36:31.827
- Yeah, so let's see.
- My stomach's small.

36:31.862 --> 36:35.793
<i>It was very considerate</i> <i>
of Abraham to bring a variety</i>

36:35.827 --> 36:39.344
of pizza 'cause he didn't know
what I liked, but I think
he should've known

36:39.379 --> 36:43.586
my eating habits before that
'cause they were all covered
in stuff

36:43.620 --> 36:45.586
that I really
couldn't eat.

36:45.620 --> 36:47.413
- I don't eat meat.
- Okay, okay, good.

36:47.448 --> 36:50.068
- I haven't eaten meat in...
Since I was 16.
- Okay, I understand.

36:50.103 --> 36:51.689
I go through
my phases where...

36:53.000 --> 36:56.793
I'm in and out of eating
certain meats as well.

36:56.827 --> 36:58.241
- Wow, this is a lot of meat.

36:59.310 --> 37:01.137
Well, we got some salads
over here.

37:01.172 --> 37:03.517
- So...
- I'm okay,
I don't need to eat.

37:03.551 --> 37:05.000
- You don't?
- No.

37:05.034 --> 37:07.655
We decided to not eat
and then we started
throwing axes.

37:07.689 --> 37:09.206
- Let's get this going.
- Okay.

37:09.241 --> 37:11.241
Yes, let's get it.
Yeah.

37:13.103 --> 37:15.068
How you doing, guys?
- Good, how are you?
I'm Shauna.

37:15.103 --> 37:17.172
- Tony. Pleasure to meet you.
- I'm Abraham.

37:17.206 --> 37:19.103
Abraham. How you doing?
Pleasure to meet you guys.

37:19.137 --> 37:21.482
All right, so I'm gonna tell
you guys a couple of things,

37:21.517 --> 37:23.517
- gonna keep you guys safe
while you here, okay?
- Okay.

37:23.551 --> 37:25.586
So there's only
gonna be one of you

37:25.620 --> 37:27.172
coming into the cage
at a time, okay?

37:27.206 --> 37:28.862
When you're done throwing,
you're gonna go ahead

37:28.896 --> 37:30.517
and you're gonna put the axe
down just like this.

37:30.551 --> 37:32.034
Never put it to the side.

37:32.068 --> 37:33.551
Otherwise, you walk by,
hit it with your hip,

37:33.586 --> 37:34.689
axe falls,
hits you on the toe.

37:34.724 --> 37:36.620
You won't forget the day
you came here to throw an axe.

37:37.931 --> 37:40.517
<i>I think axe throwing</i> <i>
was intimidating at first.</i>

37:40.551 --> 37:44.206
Um, just because there's
so much that goes into it

37:44.241 --> 37:45.862
<i>that you don't even</i> <i>
think about.</i>

37:45.896 --> 37:47.448
The bottom
or towards the middle?

37:47.482 --> 37:50.724
So at the bottom,
you're gonna put your right
hand first on the axe, okay?

37:50.758 --> 37:51.758
But...

37:54.034 --> 37:56.137
I was pretty good at it.

37:56.172 --> 37:57.827
Keep your eyes
on that target at all times.

37:59.379 --> 38:00.655
There you go!

38:00.689 --> 38:02.586
Are you serious?
Bullseye!

38:02.620 --> 38:04.724
Was I set up here?

38:04.758 --> 38:06.310
- No.

38:06.344 --> 38:07.793
That's a bullseye
right there.

38:07.827 --> 38:08.965
This is my first time
doing this.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.275
What, that was awesome.

38:10.310 --> 38:12.448
- You were chosen for this.
Very good.

38:12.482 --> 38:14.068
<i>Honestly,</i> <i>
I was a little surprised.</i>

38:14.103 --> 38:16.310
Her first throw was, like,
a bullseye.

38:16.344 --> 38:18.275
So she say that she didn't
do this, but I don't know,

38:18.310 --> 38:19.896
I'm gonna have
to look into this.

38:19.931 --> 38:21.655
I think that she might've
been doing this before.

38:25.344 --> 38:27.448
That's a good try.
Grab that axe.

38:27.482 --> 38:29.482
Don't judge me, please.

38:29.517 --> 38:32.413
<i>Abraham sucked</i> <i>
at the beginning, like,</i> <i>
I don't even think</i>

38:32.448 --> 38:34.103
<i>he got one</i> <i>
during the practice throw.</i>

38:34.137 --> 38:35.586
Oh.

38:35.620 --> 38:37.620
I'm gonna get it.
I'm telling you,
right in the middle.

38:38.620 --> 38:40.310
But he started doing better.

38:41.620 --> 38:42.793
There you go.
Yes.

38:44.034 --> 38:46.034
All right.
So this is what
we're gonna do.

38:46.068 --> 38:48.448
The first game
we're gonna play is called 21.

38:48.482 --> 38:50.655
<i>So we played</i> <i>
a game called 21.</i>

38:50.689 --> 38:54.724
Basically, you throw the axe
and each ring is a different
point system

38:54.758 --> 38:57.241
and you have
to add up to 21 exactly.

38:57.275 --> 38:58.965
Yeah, I mean,
that was difficult.

39:03.241 --> 39:04.448
Yes.

39:07.137 --> 39:08.724
- Oh, my goodness.

39:11.896 --> 39:13.517
That's a 4.

39:13.551 --> 39:15.103
- Oh.
That's a 3.

39:18.482 --> 39:21.827
- If Abraham couldn't take
my talking,

39:21.862 --> 39:25.137
then there is no reason
for us to continue
seeing each other

39:25.172 --> 39:28.655
or even talking
because I'm an

39:28.689 --> 39:30.586
- You're a bad loser.

39:30.620 --> 39:32.000
And if he can, that's great.

39:32.034 --> 39:33.034
We'll keep going.

39:34.172 --> 39:35.965
Oh, man.
- It's a 6.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.000
That's a bullseye.

39:38.517 --> 39:40.862
That was
way too loose.

39:40.896 --> 39:45.103
<i>So I didn't try to lose,</i> <i>
but I definitely got lazy.</i>

39:46.655 --> 39:47.724
One.

39:49.482 --> 39:52.586
Yeah, you gotten,
like, all the good stuff,
you know.

39:52.620 --> 39:55.965
<i>I think as the date</i> <i>
went on, that we were talking</i> <i>
more like friends.</i>

39:56.379 --> 39:57.827
Let the guy win.

39:57.862 --> 40:00.068
I think I did...

40:00.103 --> 40:02.931
I think my talking
helped me open up
a little bit.

40:02.965 --> 40:04.482
So close.

40:05.034 --> 40:06.000
I'm coming for you.

40:06.896 --> 40:08.724
It was just us talking
and getting along

40:08.758 --> 40:12.206
and, you know, just having
common interests
with certain things, you know,

40:12.241 --> 40:14.517
<i>that's always a good thing</i> <i>
with dates.</i>

40:14.551 --> 40:17.379
Bullseye.
- I can end this right now.

40:20.068 --> 40:21.620
Oh, look at you.

40:21.655 --> 40:24.551
- Would you like to draw
your line as the winner?
Yes.

40:24.586 --> 40:29.000
I'm fine losing and, honestly,
I'm not gonna lie,

40:29.034 --> 40:31.931
I think he needed to win
more than me that day.

40:31.965 --> 40:33.000
That was awesome.

40:33.034 --> 40:33.965
I had fun.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.517
Yes, I did too, you know.

40:36.551 --> 40:38.689
I appreciate you giving
me a chance to come back.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.965
That was
an awesome game, though.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.793
This was a great time.

40:46.827 --> 40:50.000
- Thank you.
- I guess, like, you know...

40:53.103 --> 40:57.275
Next time, right? We should
do this again, not axe
throwing again though 'cause--

40:57.310 --> 40:59.448
- Yeah, we can hang out again.
- Yes, that would be awesome.

40:59.482 --> 41:02.413
Give me some...
Give me some love,
that's awesome.

41:02.448 --> 41:03.413
You smell nice.

41:03.448 --> 41:04.586
Thank you, thank you.

41:04.620 --> 41:06.344
- I try to, you know...

41:06.379 --> 41:07.793
...make sure
that's a good thing,
you know,

41:07.827 --> 41:10.724
I don't wanna be
the opposite of that.

41:10.758 --> 41:15.034
<i>I think he likes me</i> <i>
somewhat, at least,</i> <i>
on a friendship level.</i>

41:15.068 --> 41:17.896
He did try to initiate
another time to hang out

41:17.931 --> 41:21.931
and that is actually
really encouraging because
I don't get that at all.

41:21.965 --> 41:23.689
<i>It was definitely</i> <i>
a great experience.</i>

41:23.724 --> 41:25.551
<i>I would love to see Shauna</i> <i>
again, it would be awesome.</i>

41:26.068 --> 41:27.034
It would be awesome.

41:27.068 --> 41:28.034
It was fun.

41:28.068 --> 41:30.103
I got to throw an axe,
he was really nice.

41:32.310 --> 41:35.000
But overall,
it went very well.

41:35.034 --> 41:37.172
You've always
lived in New York?

41:37.206 --> 41:41.000
I have kind of kept in touch
with Abraham.

41:41.034 --> 41:43.931
We haven't made any plans
to see each other.

41:43.965 --> 41:47.896
<i>I think something</i> <i>
could develop,</i> <i>
but we'll see.</i>

41:49.275 --> 41:51.275
<i>Next time</i> <i>
on</i> I Am Shauna Rae.

41:51.310 --> 41:52.965
<i>We're going</i> <i>
to an equine center.</i>

41:53.000 --> 41:56.310
We're gonna head into the barn
and go do some hands-on
with the horses.

41:56.344 --> 42:01.724
I am looking to see if I can
do things with larger animals
and if that is possible.

42:01.758 --> 42:03.586
See,
this is a tall person thing.

42:03.620 --> 42:05.413
We're gonna go ride.

42:05.448 --> 42:07.103
I'm terrified.

42:07.137 --> 42:10.137
Hershey is accustomed
to having taller humans
ride him.

42:10.172 --> 42:11.862
I'm getting nervous.

42:12.482 --> 42:14.103
Hello.

42:14.137 --> 42:17.827
<i>Since I've started dating</i> <i>
again, I've decided to go</i> <i>
to a gynecologist</i>

42:17.862 --> 42:20.103
to check on my reproductive
and fertility health.

42:20.137 --> 42:24.758
Some types of chemotherapy
can affect things
like ovaries.

42:24.793 --> 42:28.482
I've been told I can't do
a lot of things
my entire life.

42:28.517 --> 42:30.758
So being told I can't do
another thing

42:30.793 --> 42:33.000
might make me a little angry.
