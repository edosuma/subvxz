Jillian Welles has arrived.

one big Sparksy app.

01:06.959 --> 01:09.309
Something special.

01:09.386 --> 01:11.236
Something that we can build
for our children

01:11.313 --> 01:12.796
so they can hand it down
to their children.

01:12.798 --> 01:14.022
This is our home.

CROWD: No!
GEORGE: That's right.

01:19.396 --> 01:21.896
This can be a space where
everyone in the community

01:21.974 --> 01:25.492
can come together, share.

01:25.569 --> 01:28.328
Where you can learn to
cook a fiesta

01:28.405 --> 01:32.149

02:11.038 --> 02:14.282
Miss Welles, when Councilmen
Beauman first ran,

02:14.360 --> 02:15.950
didn't he say that housing
and development

02:16.028 --> 02:17.285
were the path to the future?

02:17.363 --> 02:18.620
JILLIAN: I don't recall him ever
saying that, Juan,

02:18.697 --> 02:20.030
but I will look into it for you.

02:20.032 --> 02:21.882
Excuse me, Lorraine!

02:21.958 --> 02:23.367
Love the hat.

02:23.369 --> 02:24.959
You have such an amazing
sense of style.

Good to see you, excuse me.

George on board,

02:38.050 --> 02:39.307
I am finally starting
to believe that

02:39.385 --> 02:41.551
the City Oasis Project
is gonna happen.

02:41.553 --> 02:43.478
JILLIAN: Well it is our number
one priority.

02:43.555 --> 02:45.313
THERESA: Oh, I almost forgot
to tell you.

02:45.391 --> 02:47.833
The other day, I came across the
most adorable photo of you

02:47.910 --> 02:50.151
from when you first started
to volunteer here.

02:50.229 --> 02:51.986
You couldn't have been
more than 20.

02:52.064 --> 02:53.321
JILLIAN: Theresa.
THERESA: And look at you now.

02:53.399 --> 02:54.064
And that article.

02:54.066 --> 02:55.340
You're like a celebrity.

02:55.417 --> 02:59.403
JILLIAN: Oh, stop, you're the
celebrity around here.

02:59.405 --> 03:01.254
I'm so sorry, George is
late for a meeting.

03:01.331 --> 03:02.830
I will see you soon.
THERESA: Mhmm.

03:02.908 --> 03:04.241
JILLIAN: Love you.

03:04.243 --> 03:04.832
THERESA: See you at the
breakfast.

03:04.910 --> 03:05.851
JILLIAN: Bye.

03:05.928 --> 03:07.335
JUAN: Councilman, I need
your comment on.

03:07.413 --> 03:09.763
JILLIAN: Great to see you, Juan,
great to see everyone.

03:09.839 --> 03:11.506
Thank you for a lovely day,
George, we've gotta go.

03:11.583 --> 03:11.765
REPORTERS: There they are.

03:14.086 --> 03:15.343
Councilman, answer the
big question!

03:15.421 --> 03:16.586
Is it true, are you running
for mayor?

03:16.588 --> 03:19.773
JILLIAN: Absolutely no decision
has been made.

03:19.849 --> 03:20.682
Anything you've heard
is purely rumor.

03:20.759 --> 03:22.183
REPORTER: Oh, come on.

03:22.261 --> 03:23.610
JILLIAN: Honestly, guys, there's
no tea to be spilled here.

03:23.687 --> 03:25.871
George's soul focus remains his
role as city councilman.

03:27.449 --> 03:30.375
I'll be signing the lease on the
new campaign headquarters

03:30.452 --> 03:31.210
as soon as you leave
for Connecticut.

the article end?

03:41.113 --> 03:42.629
JILLIAN: Really great.

03:42.706 --> 03:45.282
Lots of comments and engagement
and likes.

03:45.284 --> 03:47.008

GEORGE: Excellent.

03:56.311 --> 03:57.477
GEORGE: Theresa did great
with this.

03:57.554 --> 04:00.722
Love the big stack of pancakes
but come on,

04:00.799 --> 04:01.573
no syrup?

04:01.650 --> 04:02.966
JILLIAN: They do look kinda dry.

04:02.968 --> 04:05.059
(Laughing)

04:05.137 --> 04:05.727
GEORGE: Wait.

04:05.804 --> 04:08.488
JILLIAN: What is it?

04:08.565 --> 04:09.748
GEORGE: Bill Festerman's
arranging a golf weekend

04:09.825 --> 04:12.142
to introduce me to some big
potential donors.

04:12.144 --> 04:13.493
JILLIAN: That's fantastic, so?

04:13.570 --> 04:15.479
GEORGE: It is.

04:15.481 --> 04:17.314
But it's the weekend of
the 15th.

04:17.315 --> 04:17.923
JILLIAN: George, they are
counting on you.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.406
You're their headliner.

04:19.485 --> 04:21.593
GEORGE: I know, I didn't realize
it was the same weekend.

04:21.670 --> 04:24.337
JILLIAN: This is why you have to
confirm everything with me

04:24.414 --> 04:26.080
before you commit to it.

04:26.158 --> 04:27.766
GEORGE: I know, you're right.

04:27.843 --> 04:29.659
I feel awful.

04:29.661 --> 04:31.603
But there will be other events

04:31.680 --> 04:34.164
and we discussed this once we
announce on Christmas.

04:34.166 --> 04:34.773
Our focus has to be on
the campaign.

04:36.168 --> 04:37.334
It's already been set up.

04:37.336 --> 04:38.535
JILLIAN: This has already been
set up too.

04:38.537 --> 04:41.855
GEORGE: Yes, but we will need
those donors.

04:41.931 --> 04:42.522
JILLIAN: George.

04:44.676 --> 04:45.450
I will handle it.
GEORGE: That's my girl.

04:51.683 --> 04:53.016
THERESA: What's up, sweetie?

04:53.018 --> 04:54.793
JILLIAN: Theresa, hi, I am in
the car with George

04:54.870 --> 05:00.448
and we just realized there is
a major scheduling conflict.

05:00.526 --> 05:02.801
He now has a leadership
conference on the 15th.

05:03.953 --> 05:04.461
THERESA: Oh, well.

05:05.380 --> 05:06.638
Well, what time does he leave?

05:06.715 --> 05:09.382
Maybe he can just rally the
troops at breakfast.

05:09.459 --> 05:11.217
JILLIAN: I don't think that's
gonna work, Theresa.

05:11.294 --> 05:14.128
He actually flies out the
evening before.

05:14.206 --> 05:15.372
I'm so sorry.

05:15.374 --> 05:17.298
THERESA: Jillian, don't,
I trust you.

05:17.376 --> 05:20.101
I know you would never cancel
unless you absolutely had to.

05:21.713 --> 05:22.604
Merry Christmas.

05:26.051 --> 05:27.400
(Mysterious Music)

05:28.737 --> 05:29.644
JILLIAN: It's done.

05:29.721 --> 05:30.904
GEORGE: Thank you.

05:30.980 --> 05:32.980
JILLIAN: Hold my hand, kiss it.

05:33.058 --> 05:33.615
GEORGE: You're the best.

05:35.060 --> 05:36.335
Merry Christmas.

05:36.411 --> 05:37.160
JILLIAN: Indeed.

05:39.731 --> 05:40.488
GEORGE: I'm a terrible
boyfriend.

05:40.566 --> 05:41.748
JILLIAN: Yeah.

05:41.825 --> 05:42.415
GEORGE: I ate all of your
sashimi when you went

05:42.492 --> 05:43.750
to the ladies room.

05:43.827 --> 05:45.668
JILLIAN: Oh, please, I wasn't
even really hungry.

05:48.998 --> 05:50.349
GEORGE: I wish I could wait.

05:50.425 --> 05:52.242
Then we could go together but
I gotta make it in time

05:52.244 --> 05:53.685
for that symphony fundraiser
meeting.

05:53.762 --> 05:55.169
JILLIAN: It's okay.

05:55.247 --> 05:57.247
I can send you a copy
of the lease

05:57.249 --> 05:59.249
and pack for the weekend

05:59.251 --> 06:01.935
and then, just a few hours.

06:02.011 --> 06:04.437
(Laughing)

06:04.514 --> 06:05.364
GEORGE: This is gonna
be perfect.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.090
A chance for us to sort out

06:07.092 --> 06:09.759
before he campaign storm hits.

06:09.761 --> 06:11.111
I can't believe we're really
doing it.

06:11.187 --> 06:12.687
JILLIAN: Announcing your run for
mayor of New York City

06:12.764 --> 06:14.264
on Christmas Day!

06:14.266 --> 06:18.118
GEORGE: And I cannot wait to
introduce you to my family.

06:18.194 --> 06:19.828
They're going to love you
because you're perfect.

06:20.939 --> 06:22.606
JILLIAN: Well lucky for me,

06:22.608 --> 06:26.051
parents are kind of
my strong suit.

06:26.128 --> 06:27.460
I'm sure I'm gonna love
them too.

06:27.537 --> 06:29.112
They made you, honey.

06:29.114 --> 06:31.214
GEORGE: I love you.
JILLIAN: I love you too.

06:35.287 --> 06:38.563
JILLIAN: Ketchup, mustard,
old pickles.

06:38.640 --> 06:40.899
I can't believe we don't have
any food in here.

06:40.976 --> 06:42.809
I'm starving

06:42.886 --> 06:45.404
and I'm really nervous about
meeting George's parents.

06:45.480 --> 06:47.647
ZOE: "According to Miss Welles,

06:47.724 --> 06:49.074
"she remembered seeing
Mr. Beauman

06:49.151 --> 06:50.650
"speak at city council meetings

06:50.727 --> 06:51.526
"and being quite impressed
by him."

06:53.155 --> 06:55.138
Yeah, try obsessed.

06:55.140 --> 06:56.731
"According to Beauman,

06:56.808 --> 06:57.732
"he met Miss Welles when he
first considered

06:57.809 --> 06:59.418
"running for higher office

06:59.494 --> 07:01.828
"and she came on board
the exploratory committee.

07:01.905 --> 07:04.256

07:04.332 --> 07:05.907
"The second Jillian walked
through the door,

07:05.984 --> 07:08.593
"I knew she had something
special."

07:08.670 --> 07:10.003
Yeah, you got something
special all right.

07:10.079 --> 07:12.489
JILLIAN: Okay.
ZOE: Look at us.

07:12.491 --> 07:14.157
Just a couple of gals from
humble beginnings.

07:14.159 --> 07:15.592
JILLIAN: Who knew, right?

07:21.424 --> 07:22.274
ZOE: Oh, man.

07:22.350 --> 07:25.835
Political power couple.

07:25.837 --> 07:27.428
In love and basically living
together.

07:27.506 --> 07:29.022
Which reminds me.

07:29.098 --> 07:32.600
This is all the mail that came
while you've been shacking up.

07:32.678 --> 07:34.602
Put your name on it
and everything.

07:34.680 --> 07:36.346
JILLIAN: Thank you very much.

07:36.348 --> 07:37.438
Another thing.

07:37.516 --> 07:38.698
Ah.

07:38.775 --> 07:40.366
You kinda have to keep that
whole detail of us

07:40.443 --> 07:41.776
living together under wraps

07:41.853 --> 07:45.130
because George's parents
are very, very conservative.

07:45.207 --> 07:45.622
ZOE: Okay, that's weird.

07:46.950 --> 07:50.117
JILLIAN: Something I also
haven't told you.

07:50.195 --> 07:51.027
ZOE: Oh my God, what?

07:51.029 --> 07:54.214
You're pregnant?
JILLIAN: No.

07:54.290 --> 07:56.716
Two top political consulting
firms

07:56.793 --> 07:58.051
have reached out to me.

07:58.127 --> 08:00.628
I had to play coy with them
about George running

08:00.706 --> 08:04.816
but they pretty much said that
if everything goes well,

08:04.893 --> 08:06.634
I can pretty much write
my own ticket.

08:06.712 --> 08:09.303
ZOE: Oh my God, Jillian,
that's huge!

08:09.381 --> 08:09.988
JILLIAN: We gotta toast to that.
ZOE: Oh, we do.

08:15.570 --> 08:17.996
JILLIAN: To the perfect weekend.

08:22.244 --> 08:25.337
(Phone Ringing)

08:25.413 --> 08:26.579
ZOE: Oh, look, it's the other
half

08:26.656 --> 08:27.580
of the political power couple.

08:30.919 --> 08:31.918
JILLIAN: Hi, hon.

08:31.995 --> 08:34.160
GEORGE: Hey, sweetie,
we're all set.

08:34.239 --> 08:34.904
Everything's in place for
the symphony.

08:34.905 --> 08:36.072
Festerman's locked in.

08:36.073 --> 08:38.258
You'll finally get to meet
his wife, Irene.

08:38.333 --> 08:40.167
And my family,

08:40.245 --> 08:42.354
well, they're dying to
get you up here.

08:42.429 --> 08:44.080
Let's just say, that article
was a big hit.

08:44.082 --> 08:45.265
JILLIAN: Well thanks for sending
the car.

08:45.341 --> 08:46.340
I'll be there in no time.

08:46.418 --> 08:47.692
GEORGE: You're the best.

08:47.769 --> 08:49.085
I mean that.

08:49.087 --> 08:50.028
Oh and I almost forgot.

08:50.105 --> 08:51.512
You're basically a hero
around here.

08:51.590 --> 08:54.274
Thanks for picking up that Poppy
Dot for my little niece.

08:54.350 --> 08:57.594
My sister says she can't stop
talking about it.

08:57.596 --> 08:58.595
JILLIAN: I'm sorry, what?

08:58.597 --> 08:59.979
GEORGE: The Poppy Dot.

09:00.057 --> 09:01.948
For Megan.

09:02.025 --> 09:03.858
Remember, I told her if she
got her grades up

09:03.935 --> 09:04.768
I'd get it for her for
Christmas?

09:04.770 --> 09:05.769
You said you'd take care of it.

09:05.771 --> 09:08.288
JILLIAN: Ummm...

09:08.364 --> 09:10.215
GEORGE: Please tell me you
didn't forget it.

09:10.292 --> 09:11.383
We were counting on you.

09:11.459 --> 09:12.942
JILLIAN: No, no, no,
I didn't forget.

09:12.944 --> 09:14.719
GEORGE: Megan worked her butt
off to get straight A's

09:14.796 --> 09:15.612
and we already told her she
was getting it.

09:15.614 --> 09:16.963
She went absolutely nuts.

09:17.040 --> 09:20.041
JILLIAN: I didn't forget,
it was, you know, the wifi.

09:20.118 --> 09:21.117
It was like.

09:21.119 --> 09:22.118
(Stammering)

09:22.120 --> 09:23.303
JILLIAN: You know?

09:23.379 --> 09:24.304
GEORGE: Thank God.

09:24.380 --> 09:25.212
You scared me.

09:25.290 --> 09:26.380
I thought you--

09:26.458 --> 09:27.732
JILLIAN: Oh hey, here it is
right here.

09:27.809 --> 09:29.892
ZOE: Why are you waving my
vintage underwear around?

09:31.387 --> 09:32.812
Hi, George.

09:32.889 --> 09:34.221
JILLIAN: I have it.

09:34.299 --> 09:35.465
No worries.

09:35.467 --> 09:36.149
GEORGE: You never forget.

09:36.225 --> 09:37.242
You're my ace.

09:37.319 --> 09:39.077
You always have my back.

09:39.154 --> 09:39.911
All right, I'll see you soon.

09:39.988 --> 09:41.413
I love you.

09:41.489 --> 09:41.638
JILLIAN: Okay, love you too,
bye.

09:55.153 --> 09:55.710
JILLIAN: Crap.

09:59.491 --> 10:00.840
ZOE: What is wrong with you?

10:00.917 --> 10:03.843
JILLIAN: I know, I'm stuck and
I just lied to George.

10:03.920 --> 10:06.104
Now I gotta go find some thing
called a Poppy Dot.

10:06.181 --> 10:08.422
I can't believe I forgot.

10:08.500 --> 10:09.999
Between the campaign
and the holidays

10:10.001 --> 10:10.942
and trying to meet these
parents.

10:11.019 --> 10:12.593
I just blanked.

10:12.671 --> 10:15.021
ANNOUNCER: Spice up your holiday
with the hottest new tech toy!

10:15.098 --> 10:16.673
KIDS: The Poppy Dot!

10:16.675 --> 10:18.099
ANNOUNCER: Explore a world
of fun.

10:18.176 --> 10:19.117
Just tell the Poppy Dot what
you want to do.

10:19.194 --> 10:20.193
KIDS: Tell me a story.

10:20.269 --> 10:21.727
ANNOUNCER: Or Poppy Dot
can suggest

10:21.805 --> 10:24.772
all sorts of fun activities.
POPPY DOT: Let's make a video!

10:24.850 --> 10:27.942
ANNOUNCER: Use the app for
custom colors and navigation.

10:28.019 --> 10:28.852
Poppy Dot will be your
best friend!

10:28.854 --> 10:30.186
ZOE: Those things creep me out.

10:30.188 --> 10:33.373
It's like an Alexa, a Home Pod
and a strobe light

10:33.449 --> 10:34.782
had a three-way and then somehow
had a baby.

10:34.860 --> 10:37.360
JILLIAN: Well it looks like now
I'll be stopping off

10:37.362 --> 10:38.528
to get a Poppy Dot.

10:38.530 --> 10:40.213
ZOE: Hello, I don't think so.

10:40.289 --> 10:42.289
Poppy Dot went It-Toy status.

10:42.367 --> 10:44.976
They're sold out everywhere.
JILLIAN: This?

10:45.053 --> 10:46.052
POPPY DOT: Poppy Dot loves
everybody!

10:47.205 --> 10:49.038
ZOE: Sold out, sold out!

10:49.040 --> 10:50.482
JILLIAN: Why won't they pick up!

10:50.558 --> 10:52.542
ZOE: Can't you just call George
back and tell him the truth?

10:52.544 --> 10:54.653
JILLIAN: No, I can't!

10:54.729 --> 10:56.562
It just dawned on me that this
whole Dot thing

10:56.639 --> 10:58.064
is a really big deal to Megan.

10:58.141 --> 10:59.399
I mean, this is the only present

10:59.475 --> 11:00.808
that she even really asked for

11:00.886 --> 11:01.660
and I told George
I already had it

11:01.736 --> 11:03.161
and I even used a visual.

11:03.238 --> 11:05.738
This is the first impression
I'm making on these people,

11:05.815 --> 11:06.981
I cannot tell them
I forgot about it

11:07.058 --> 11:08.983
and then lies about it,
are you kidding me?!

11:09.060 --> 11:11.728
ZOE: Wait, it says Colossal Toys
has one left still.

11:11.730 --> 11:12.395
JILLIAN: Okay!
ZOE: Let's go!

11:12.397 --> 11:12.912
JILLIAN: Go!

11:14.566 --> 11:15.748
SANTA: Merry Christmas!

11:15.825 --> 11:16.841
JILLIAN: Sorry, I already gave
at the office!

11:18.920 --> 11:21.571
(Suspenseful Music)

11:21.573 --> 11:22.739
JILLIAN: Poppy Dots, Poppy Dots!

11:22.741 --> 11:23.798
ZOE: Thirsty for Poppy Dots!

11:29.915 --> 11:31.264
(Sighing)

11:31.340 --> 11:32.348
JILLIAN: Thank God, we did it.

11:34.920 --> 11:36.010
JILLIAN: Hey,
what're you doing?

11:36.087 --> 11:36.978
That was mine.

11:38.440 --> 11:40.014
You don't understand.

11:40.091 --> 11:41.758
I have to have that, okay,
I was right here.

11:41.760 --> 11:44.369
GIRL: Maybe you should be like
Elsa from "Frozen"

11:44.446 --> 11:44.986
and let it go.

11:49.859 --> 11:51.492
ZOE: You just got owned by
a 10 year old.

11:53.529 --> 11:54.546
JILLIAN: I need that dot.

12:00.779 --> 12:01.553
ZOE: So what're you gonna do?

12:01.629 --> 12:03.129
JILLIAN: I don't know.

12:03.206 --> 12:06.616
Maybe go see if you can bribe a
store manager or something.

12:06.618 --> 12:07.617
Maybe somebody put one on hold.

12:07.619 --> 12:08.468
ZOE: Okay.

12:18.964 --> 12:20.387
JILLIAN: Oh, hi.

12:20.465 --> 12:21.889
Again.

12:21.967 --> 12:23.241
Remember me?

12:23.318 --> 12:26.727
GIRL: Our encounter is forever
etched into my brain.

12:26.805 --> 12:27.579
JILLIAN: Oh, good.

12:27.655 --> 12:29.155
Well,

12:29.232 --> 12:31.916
I know you might not be allowed
to take money from strangers

12:31.993 --> 12:33.309
but since you remember
me so well,

12:33.311 --> 12:35.645
maybe you can take some
money from me.

12:35.647 --> 12:37.738
Whatever money app you prefer.

12:37.816 --> 12:38.873
I'm willing to go pretty
high here.

12:42.912 --> 12:43.762
That's a real no, huh?

12:45.414 --> 12:46.380
Well.

12:48.417 --> 12:49.416
That's fine.

12:49.494 --> 12:50.259
That's okay.

12:52.998 --> 12:53.596
To think, it's all because
of that

12:55.183 --> 12:56.057
cute little puppy.

13:00.021 --> 13:01.929
GIRL: What puppy?
JILLIAN: Oh, wow.

13:02.007 --> 13:03.931
I mean, the box design is great.

13:04.009 --> 13:06.359
Just so harmonious with
the coloring

13:06.435 --> 13:07.952
and the way the font just pops,
you know?

13:08.029 --> 13:10.346
It's like "Pop-Pee-Dot, yes!"

13:10.348 --> 13:12.682
You know, just marketing
extravaganza.

13:12.684 --> 13:14.350
In a five by five box.

13:14.352 --> 13:15.627
So beautiful.

13:15.703 --> 13:16.628
GIRL: What about the puppy?

13:16.704 --> 13:17.078
JILLIAN: Oh, I'm sorry.

13:18.706 --> 13:19.539
You didn't hear all that?

13:19.615 --> 13:21.115
All the commotion.

13:21.192 --> 13:22.116
The little girl racing around
the store,

13:22.193 --> 13:22.783
looking for her lost puppy?

13:22.861 --> 13:24.527
It was terrible.

13:24.529 --> 13:28.047
Here I was, you know, with the
Poppy Dot in my hand

13:28.124 --> 13:29.974
and I was at the register
about to pay,

13:30.051 --> 13:30.633
but then who do I see

13:32.370 --> 13:33.961
in the dinosaur aisle.

13:34.039 --> 13:38.983
Cute fur ball of joy just trying
to survive on his own.

13:39.060 --> 13:42.395
I put down the Dot, you know,
and I ran to get him.

13:43.306 --> 13:44.638
I put my name on the box,

13:44.716 --> 13:48.234
figuring I could come back for
it later, you know?

13:48.311 --> 13:49.476
That's my name right there.

13:49.554 --> 13:50.152
It said, "Jillian."

13:51.480 --> 13:52.822
I'm Jillian.

13:54.242 --> 13:56.576
(Sighing)

13:56.652 --> 13:58.670
GIRL: Oh, your name is on it.

13:58.746 --> 14:00.563
You did save that puppy.

14:00.565 --> 14:03.082
JILLIAN: Yes.

14:03.159 --> 14:04.417
GIRL: You should have it.

14:04.493 --> 14:05.510
JILLIAN: Really?

14:07.906 --> 14:08.838
GIRL: Merry Christmas.

14:10.592 --> 14:11.132
JILLIAN: Merry Christmas.

14:15.914 --> 14:17.096

14:17.173 --> 14:18.014

14:19.584 --> 14:20.358
Were you?

14:23.012 --> 14:25.187
SANTA: Did you lie to that
little girl

14:27.108 --> 14:27.866
to get the last Poppy Dot?

14:29.611 --> 14:31.277
JILLIAN: I don't even think this
is the last one.

14:31.354 --> 14:33.096
They have a bunch more
on back order.

14:33.098 --> 14:36.357
So, I mean,

14:36.434 --> 14:37.876
you know.

14:37.952 --> 14:39.711
Technically, this isn't any of
your business anyway.

14:39.787 --> 14:42.105
You know, you give out your
gifts, I give out mine.

14:42.107 --> 14:42.330
What's the big deal?

14:43.775 --> 14:46.125
You should put your own name
on the naughty list.

14:46.202 --> 14:48.461
You don't even know me to judge
me the way you judge me.

14:48.537 --> 14:49.612
That's not even fair.

14:49.614 --> 14:52.056

14:55.453 --> 14:56.969
SANTA: You're right.

at all anymore.

GEORGE: You made it.

16:21.206 --> 16:22.480
GEORGE: And Blake, he wanted
to be here

16:22.557 --> 16:23.815
but he was too busy at
the hardware store

16:23.891 --> 16:26.375
making the house look like
it's on the Vegas strip.

16:26.377 --> 16:28.211
Nobody wants to rein him
in on that.

GEORGE: Well, it's tacky, Dad.

16:29.881 --> 16:30.655
GRANDMA: Now I hope
you're hungry.

16:30.732 --> 16:32.381
I made something special
for you.

It's an old family recipe that
I make every year.

16:36.721 --> 16:38.054
Has George told you about it?

16:38.056 --> 16:39.813

called it

16:46.231 --> 16:47.005
when they warned me about it
on the telephone.

Grandma, she's kidding,
she's just kidding, right?

17:05.083 --> 17:07.525
JILLIAN: George said that the
dog almost died last year.

17:07.602 --> 17:09.527
He had to get his stomach pumped

17:09.604 --> 17:11.436
with some kind of
a black charcoal.

17:11.513 --> 17:13.513
The vet visit was $800 dollars
plus meds.

17:13.590 --> 17:16.034
I think they boarded him this
year just to save his life.

17:49.885 --> 17:51.460
This is our home.

JILLIAN: It's lovely.
MOTHER: Thank you.

17:52.647 --> 17:54.146
Oh, I have to show you this.

17:54.223 --> 17:58.317
I just picked this up last week
at a charity auction

17:58.394 --> 17:59.969
for the Audubon Society.

17:59.971 --> 18:03.155
What do you think?
JILLIAN: It's bad.

18:03.232 --> 18:04.824
Ah, what I mean is,

18:06.144 --> 18:07.418
it's really bad, like it should
be named,

18:18.489 --> 18:20.264

to your room?

very much.

JILLIAN: Mrs. Beauman.
MOTHER: Yes?

18:27.165 --> 18:29.682
JILLIAN: I don't know what is
happening with me.

18:29.758 --> 18:33.594
But I do know that I would like
to impress you very much

18:33.671 --> 18:35.855
and normally I'm quite good
at that.

18:35.931 --> 18:41.177
I did have a few tequila shots
with my friend before I came.

18:41.179 --> 18:44.271
Maybe that, coupled with
my nerves,

18:44.349 --> 18:45.865
is the cause of all this.

18:45.941 --> 18:47.032
MOTHER: That's all right, dear.

18:47.109 --> 18:48.517
Between you and I,

18:48.519 --> 18:51.687
I may have had a few cocktails
at the auction, myself.

18:51.689 --> 18:53.205
(Chuckling)

18:53.282 --> 18:54.039
MOTHER: Just up here.

18:55.860 --> 18:56.950
Oh, that's Lacey.

18:57.028 --> 18:58.136
JILLIAN: Pretty.

18:58.212 --> 18:58.803
And there's George.

18:58.880 --> 18:59.879
Hot.

18:59.955 --> 19:02.289
And my baby, Blake.

19:02.367 --> 19:04.308
Isn't he adorable?
JILLIAN: Huge head.

19:04.385 --> 19:05.426
MOTHER: Trust me, dear,
I remember.

19:09.540 --> 19:11.816
We have you and George
in separate bedrooms.

19:11.893 --> 19:13.376
That's just the way we do things
around here

19:13.378 --> 19:14.485
for those who are unwed.

19:14.562 --> 19:16.320
I hope you don't mind.

19:16.397 --> 19:17.471
Do you?

19:17.548 --> 19:18.714
JILLIAN: No.

19:18.716 --> 19:21.492
I spends seven nights
a week with George.

19:21.569 --> 19:22.735
He's a total blanket hogger.

19:22.811 --> 19:24.553
I'm actually looking forward
to the break.

19:24.555 --> 19:25.613
Not to mention the snoring.

19:28.226 --> 19:28.657
MOTHER: Seven nights a week.

19:30.077 --> 19:33.337
So basically, you--

19:33.414 --> 19:34.172
JILLIAN: We're basically living
together.

19:34.248 --> 19:36.065
Cohabiting, syncopating.

19:36.067 --> 19:36.790
Whatever you wanna call it.

19:37.902 --> 19:38.843
Good talk, bye.

19:43.257 --> 19:45.424
Dammit, what is happening to me?

19:45.501 --> 19:47.301
(Huffing)

19:51.432 --> 19:52.306
POPPY DOT: Liar, liar,
pants on fire.

19:53.918 --> 19:54.692
Yes, you, Jillian.

19:57.088 --> 19:59.146
(Mysterious Music)

20:11.936 --> 20:14.061
(Sighing)

20:14.138 --> 20:14.453
JILLIAN: Poppy Dot,

20:15.940 --> 20:18.441
what did you just say?

20:18.443 --> 20:19.775
POPPY DOT: Merry Christmas.

20:19.777 --> 20:21.052
I'm your personal Poppy Dot.

20:21.128 --> 20:22.611
Want to play a game?

20:22.613 --> 20:24.204
(Laughing)

20:24.282 --> 20:25.872
(Sighing)

20:25.950 --> 20:27.967
JILLIAN: Oh my goodness.

20:28.043 --> 20:29.134
POPPY DOT: Let's count
how many times

20:29.211 --> 20:30.803
Jillian has lied today.

20:30.879 --> 20:32.379
(Jillian Screams)

20:32.457 --> 20:35.124
POPPY DOT: Two, three, four,

20:35.126 --> 20:36.475
five, six.
(Knocking)

20:36.552 --> 20:37.735
MOTHER: Jillian?
POPPY DOT: Seven.

20:37.812 --> 20:39.570
JILLIAN: Shut up, Poppy Dot!

20:39.647 --> 20:40.629
MOTHER: Jillian,
are you all right?

20:40.631 --> 20:43.315
JILLIAN: Uh, no.

20:43.392 --> 20:43.983
MOTHER: Do you want me
to come in?

20:44.059 --> 20:45.818
JILLIAN: God, no!

20:45.894 --> 20:48.079
I mean,

20:48.155 --> 20:52.232
the toy I bought for Megan talks

20:52.310 --> 20:54.977
and it just scared me,
that's all.

20:54.979 --> 20:56.479
MOTHER: Well, that was
quite a scream.

20:56.481 --> 20:56.921
JILLIAN: Yeah, that's me.

20:56.998 --> 20:58.330
I'm a screamer.

20:58.407 --> 20:59.740
Thank God I'm not sleeping in
a room with George.

20:59.817 --> 21:02.909
(Gasping)

21:02.987 --> 21:07.156
MOTHER: Well, as long
as you're all right.

21:07.158 --> 21:08.340
Okay.

21:19.003 --> 21:21.337
(Christmas Music)

21:21.339 --> 21:27.118
(Phone Jingling)

21:27.194 --> 21:29.178
ZOE: Hold on one sec,
Jill, okay?

21:29.180 --> 21:31.322
JILLIAN: Help me!

21:31.398 --> 21:32.197
ZOE: Jillian, are you all right?

21:32.274 --> 21:33.682
JILLIAN: No.

21:33.684 --> 21:37.628
Something is happening to me and
I don't know what it is.

21:37.705 --> 21:40.689
I think I've been cursed
by Santa.

21:40.691 --> 21:41.966
ZOE: Okay, I don't think that's
what Santa does.

21:42.043 --> 21:46.119
Maybe you're confusing Santa
with Satan.

21:46.197 --> 21:48.030
JILLIAN: I know how to spell,
okay?

21:48.032 --> 21:49.381
I lied to the little girl
in the store

21:49.458 --> 21:52.626
and when Santa asked me if
I lied, I lied to him too

21:52.703 --> 21:55.629
and now the Poppy Dot
is taunting me!

21:55.706 --> 21:57.798
ZOE: Right,
Santa made your tech turn.

21:57.875 --> 21:59.800
JILLIAN: I don't know, okay?

21:59.877 --> 22:02.545
I just know I remember the way
he was looking at me

22:02.547 --> 22:03.729
with those disapproving eyes,
okay?

22:05.232 --> 22:06.565
Something has happened.

22:06.642 --> 22:08.475
Suddenly I can't lie.

22:08.553 --> 22:09.885
ZOE: That's hysterical.

22:09.887 --> 22:10.719
You work in politics.

22:10.721 --> 22:12.555
JILLIAN: That's very funny.

22:12.557 --> 22:13.831
Look, I've been here
five minutes

22:13.908 --> 22:17.335
and already I've insulted
George's mom's painting,

22:17.411 --> 22:18.836
I told her her son had
a big head.

22:18.913 --> 22:20.563
You don't even wanna know,
the worst of all,

22:20.565 --> 22:21.505
as soon as I got here
I was like--

22:21.582 --> 22:22.989
(Knocking)

22:23.067 --> 22:24.233
GRANDMA: Jillian, it's Grandma.

22:24.235 --> 22:26.068
JILLIAN: No, no.

22:26.070 --> 22:27.011
GRANDMA: I'd like to talk
to you.

22:27.088 --> 22:28.995
JILLIAN: It's George's
grandmother.

22:29.073 --> 22:30.014
ZOE: So what?

22:30.091 --> 22:31.164
What's wrong with that?

22:31.242 --> 22:33.242
(Knocking)
GRANDMA: Are you in there?

22:33.244 --> 22:34.167
JILLIAN: She's got me cornered.

22:34.245 --> 22:35.019
I can't lie.

22:36.581 --> 22:37.471
I'll call you back!

22:43.512 --> 22:47.022
(Groaning)
(Grandma Mumbling)

22:49.760 --> 22:50.275
GRANDMA: Yoo-hoo?

23:02.456 --> 23:03.881
GRANDMA: Jillian, I'm coming
in here.

23:03.958 --> 23:04.623
Okay now.

23:12.133 --> 23:13.632
JILLIAN: Oh my God.

23:23.385 --> 23:24.351
GRANDMA: I coulda sworn
she was in here.

23:26.147 --> 23:28.689
(Comedic Music)

23:35.806 --> 23:36.580
BLAKE: Hi.
(Screaming)

23:38.567 --> 23:40.584
BLAKE: I'm Blake,
George's brother.

23:44.148 --> 23:47.499
JILLIAN: I literally thought
that you were an ax murderer.

23:49.578 --> 23:50.761
Hi, I'm Jillian,
I'm George's--

23:50.838 --> 23:53.338
BLAKE: Yeah, I know,
I kinda figured.

23:53.415 --> 23:54.156
You wanna tell me what that
was all about?

23:54.158 --> 23:55.048
JILLIAN: Honestly, no.

23:56.585 --> 23:57.751
BLAKE: I think you
kinda have to.

23:57.828 --> 23:58.936
I just busted you climbing
out of a window

23:59.013 --> 24:00.604
and being super weird, so.

24:00.681 --> 24:02.589
JILLIAN: I was trying to get
away from your grandmother.

24:02.667 --> 24:05.668
It's a long story but she wanted
to ask me some questions

24:05.670 --> 24:07.186
and I didn't want to hurt
her feelings.

24:07.262 --> 24:09.095
BLAKE: So you climbed down
a trellis.

24:09.173 --> 24:10.781
JILLIAN: Mhmm.

24:10.858 --> 24:12.616
BLAKE: Okay.
JILLIAN: What're you doing?

24:12.693 --> 24:15.027
BLAKE: I have a lot of stuff to
take care of, okay?

24:15.103 --> 24:15.619
JILLIAN: Rude.

24:17.272 --> 24:18.347
BLAKE: Look, obviously
something's going on

24:18.349 --> 24:19.515
but don't look me in the
eye and tell me

24:19.517 --> 24:22.293
that a political consultant
from New York

24:22.369 --> 24:24.311
can't talk her way around
my grandmother.

24:24.388 --> 24:25.187
JILLIAN: It's true.

24:25.189 --> 24:25.946
BLAKE: No, come on.

24:26.023 --> 24:27.523
An 80 year old civilian?

24:27.525 --> 24:29.115
I feel like someone like you
could handle that in her sleep.

24:29.193 --> 24:30.634
JILLIAN: Someone like me?

24:30.711 --> 24:33.529
BLAKE: Yeah, you know, someone
who basically lies for a living.

24:33.531 --> 24:35.306
JILLIAN: Oh, excuse me.

24:35.382 --> 24:38.625
How dare you just take what
I do and distill it down

24:38.703 --> 24:39.960
to the most simplistic
definition.

24:40.037 --> 24:42.554
I worked hard to get where
I am, okay?

24:42.631 --> 24:44.056
Politics is a very complex
world.

24:44.132 --> 24:46.208
It's a game of strategy.

24:46.210 --> 24:47.042
What I do is very important.

24:47.044 --> 24:48.210
BLAKE: Mhmm.

24:48.212 --> 24:49.653
And what exactly is it that
you do again?

24:51.232 --> 24:53.732
JILLIAN: I tell people exactly
what they need to hear

24:53.809 --> 24:54.608
so that your brother can
get elected.

24:58.389 --> 24:59.112
BLAKE: Bingo.

25:01.892 --> 25:02.783
(Groaning)

25:07.898 --> 25:10.156
JILLIAN: George warned me you
were difficult.

25:10.234 --> 25:11.842
BLAKE: Well by "difficult," he
means I disagree with him

25:11.919 --> 25:13.902
on most personal, social
and political issues

25:13.904 --> 25:15.179
and it makes him crazy,
then yeah.

25:15.256 --> 25:16.347
I guess I'm difficult.

25:16.423 --> 25:18.090
JILLIAN: All right,

25:18.166 --> 25:20.759
I admit I should be able to spin
some white lie

25:20.836 --> 25:23.687
and just handle your grandma
but the truth is,

25:23.764 --> 25:24.855
your grandmother's very sweet,
okay,

25:24.932 --> 25:27.507
and I don't wanna hurt
her feelings.

25:27.585 --> 25:29.101
GEORGE: Oh, great,
I see you met Jillian.

25:29.177 --> 25:29.851
BLAKE: I have, indeed.

25:31.438 --> 25:34.848
FATHER: Well, may I say you are
even more beautiful in person

25:34.925 --> 25:35.699
than you appear on this cover.

25:35.776 --> 25:37.109
JILLIAN: Thank you.

25:37.185 --> 25:39.203
FATHER: You really do make a
strong looking couple.

25:39.280 --> 25:40.538
When I consulted with
Governor Walsh,

25:40.614 --> 25:43.023
he agreed you're gonna play
on all demographics.

25:43.100 --> 25:46.602
You're clean cut, you're serious
but you're not stodgy.

25:46.604 --> 25:48.270
There's no stodgy, you're young.

25:48.272 --> 25:49.029
You're aspirational.

25:49.106 --> 25:51.106
(Chuckling)

25:51.108 --> 25:52.550
FATHER: And what about this
handsome, young guy, huh?

25:52.626 --> 25:56.202
He looks pretty darn good on
this cover as well, doesn't he?

25:56.280 --> 25:57.129
And where do you think he got
that from?

25:59.374 --> 26:01.116
JILLIAN: It's obvious that it
comes from you, Mr. Beauman.

26:01.118 --> 26:03.394
(Laughing)

26:03.470 --> 26:05.804
JILLIAN: The 24 thousand dollars
in veneers didn't hurt though.

26:05.881 --> 26:07.306
FATHER: 24 thousand in veneers?

26:07.382 --> 26:08.548
BLAKE: 24 thousand?

26:08.626 --> 26:09.382
FATHER: Really?

26:09.460 --> 26:10.568
Open up.

26:10.644 --> 26:12.570
Let me see.

26:12.646 --> 26:13.812
JILLIAN: A little Botox between
the brows.

26:13.889 --> 26:15.573
FATHER: Oh, a little Botox too.

26:15.649 --> 26:17.074
GEORGE: Stop it, what're
you doing?

26:17.151 --> 26:18.224
GEORGE: Stop.
GRANDMA: There you are, Jillian.

26:18.302 --> 26:20.485
I was just looking for you.

26:20.562 --> 26:22.395
I wanted to have a little chat
with you.

26:22.473 --> 26:25.808
I need to get to the bottom
of a few things.

26:25.810 --> 26:28.401
GEORGE: Gram, I told you she was
just kidding.

26:28.479 --> 26:29.645
BLAKE: Yeah, come on, Grandma.

26:29.647 --> 26:30.254
Don't pounce on the poor girl.

26:30.331 --> 26:31.814
She's our guest.

26:31.816 --> 26:33.482
She just got here.

26:33.484 --> 26:33.832
GRANDMA: I'm heading home.

26:37.154 --> 26:38.170
FATHER: Mother.

26:38.246 --> 26:38.745
She was just joking.

26:38.823 --> 26:40.005
GEORGE: Grandma.

26:46.497 --> 26:49.773
Jillian, Jillian, Jillian.

26:49.850 --> 26:51.016
What is happening with you?

26:51.093 --> 26:53.277
You haven't been yourself since
you got here.

26:53.354 --> 26:55.095
I mean, toxic stew?

26:55.172 --> 26:56.004
My veneers, the Botox?

26:56.006 --> 26:58.190
What's next?

26:58.266 --> 26:59.191
JILLIAN: I kinda told your mom

26:59.267 --> 27:01.601
we're practically living
together.

27:01.679 --> 27:03.287
GEORGE: What?
Jillian!

27:03.364 --> 27:04.847
Wait, how'd she take that?

27:04.849 --> 27:07.440
JILLIAN: I don't know because
I kinda slammed the door

27:07.518 --> 27:09.785
in her face as she was
taking it all in.

27:11.446 --> 27:13.113
Look, okay, I'm sorry.

27:13.190 --> 27:14.706
I did not mean for all this
stuff to happen.

27:14.783 --> 27:17.951
GEORGE: It is like you have
short circuited or something.

27:18.028 --> 27:18.527
What is it?

27:18.529 --> 27:19.637
Is it nerves?

27:19.713 --> 27:22.547
JILLIAN: I wish I could blame
this on nerves

27:22.624 --> 27:23.866
but I think it's the Poppy Dot.

27:23.868 --> 27:25.217
GEORGE: Stress, it's stress.

27:25.293 --> 27:26.702
JILLIAN: Again, I wish I could
say yes to that

27:26.704 --> 27:29.813
and just end this conversation
but it is the Poppy Dot.

27:29.890 --> 27:32.040
GEORGE: Why wouldn't you tell me
what's going on with you?

27:32.042 --> 27:33.208
JILLIAN: I am telling you
what's going on

27:33.210 --> 27:34.559
but you're not listening to me

27:34.636 --> 27:36.895
and I know it sounds crazy and
you're very judgmental.

27:36.972 --> 27:38.046
GEORGE: Whoa, wait.

27:38.048 --> 27:38.989
Thanks a lot.

27:39.066 --> 27:39.648
I am not.

27:42.144 --> 27:43.643
Maybe I'm a little judgmental,
but still.

27:43.721 --> 27:47.556
Sweetheart, I won't judge you.

27:47.558 --> 27:49.166
I just need to know what's
going on with you.

27:49.243 --> 27:51.560
JILLIAN: I don't know

27:51.562 --> 27:55.247
but I think it's a curse.

27:55.323 --> 27:56.489
GEORGE: You're blaming this on
your period?

27:56.567 --> 27:58.066
JILLIAN: No, George, like an
actual curse.

27:58.068 --> 27:59.418
GEORGE: Uuuhhh.

27:59.494 --> 28:00.660
JILLIAN: Okay, the truth is,

28:00.738 --> 28:02.254
when you asked me about
the Poppy Dot earlier,

28:02.330 --> 28:03.663
I didn't have it.

28:03.741 --> 28:06.091
I forgot to get it so I went
racing all over the city

28:06.168 --> 28:08.577
trying to find one and when
I found the last one,

28:08.579 --> 28:10.187
I had to tell a big
lie to get it

28:10.264 --> 28:12.931
and then I had to lie to just
cover up the big lie.

28:13.008 --> 28:14.750
GEORGE: Jillian.

28:14.752 --> 28:16.084
JILLIAN: What?

28:16.086 --> 28:18.362
GEORGE: Look, I know some lies

28:18.439 --> 28:20.255
in the political realm,
that's okay.

28:20.257 --> 28:22.682
But lying to me, that's a breach
of our trust.

28:22.760 --> 28:25.369
JILLIAN: I know but I didn't
want to disappoint Megan or you.

28:26.188 --> 28:27.446
Okay?

28:27.522 --> 28:29.355
GEORGE: All right, all right,
I understand that.

28:29.433 --> 28:31.691
But, I mean, you only told
a few lies.

28:31.769 --> 28:33.193
Why did you get so thrown off?

28:33.270 --> 28:35.604
JILLIAN: Well, because the
person that I lied to the last

28:35.606 --> 28:40.366
was Santa and I believe that he
has it out for me now

28:40.444 --> 28:41.626
because he--
GEORGE: Okay, Santa?

28:41.703 --> 28:42.277
JILLIAN: You know,
ever since then.

28:42.279 --> 28:43.628
GEORGE: Jillian.

28:43.705 --> 28:44.722
JILLIAN: Okay, look,
I'll show you.

28:44.798 --> 28:48.300
Poppy Dot, tell me what
you think of me.

28:48.376 --> 28:49.134
POPPY DOT: Poppy Dot
loves everyone!

28:49.211 --> 28:49.801
Wanna play?

28:49.878 --> 28:51.970
We can make a video.

28:52.047 --> 28:53.680
(Groaning)

28:55.476 --> 29:00.812
POPPY DOT: Feliz Navidad is
Spanish for Merry Christmas!

29:00.889 --> 29:02.072
JILLIAN: It was really
just saying

29:02.149 --> 29:03.741
very disturbing things earlier.

29:03.817 --> 29:04.908
If you would've heard it.

29:04.985 --> 29:06.226
I mean, it's gonna do it.

29:06.303 --> 29:07.411
GEORGE: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:07.488 --> 29:08.895
Put it down, put it down.

29:08.973 --> 29:11.582
Okay, you are stressed out.

29:11.658 --> 29:13.141
I know you don't wanna believe
that but you are.

29:13.143 --> 29:16.754
I think you put a little too
much pressure on yourself,

29:16.830 --> 29:18.422
all right, to make a good
impression here.

29:18.499 --> 29:20.983
And, plus, with the looming
announcement,

29:20.985 --> 29:22.651
I think it was just a little
too much.

29:22.653 --> 29:23.668
And then, once you forgot
the Poppy Dot,

29:23.745 --> 29:25.654
it just threw you over the edge.

29:25.656 --> 29:26.671
You know?

29:26.748 --> 29:28.932
JILLIAN: It just--
GEORGE: It's okay.

29:29.009 --> 29:30.325
It's okay, everyone has
a bad day, right?

29:30.327 --> 29:31.676
So, you sit.

29:31.753 --> 29:32.427
Let's get you up there.

29:34.331 --> 29:35.847
All right?

29:35.924 --> 29:36.774
I'm gonna seal you in here.

29:36.850 --> 29:38.275
You're gonna get some rest.

29:38.352 --> 29:42.112
Tomorrow, you're gonna wake up
old Jillian Welles again.

29:42.189 --> 29:43.096
All right?
JILLIAN: Okay.

29:43.173 --> 29:45.690
GEORGE: Forget all about this.

29:45.767 --> 29:47.100
All right, sweetheart.

29:47.177 --> 29:49.102
JILLIAN: I love you, Georgie.

29:49.179 --> 29:50.070

sweetie.

JILLIAN: Yes, it is.

30:22.304 --> 30:22.978

30:24.064 --> 30:26.806
JILLIAN: You think so?

30:26.884 --> 30:28.400
Well, you keep it then.

30:29.978 --> 30:30.886
I don't want it.

30:30.888 --> 30:32.162
It just talks and talks.

30:32.239 --> 30:32.996
It's getting on my nerves!

30:39.821 --> 30:41.997
BLAKE: I feel like you could've
just turned it off.

30:44.568 --> 30:46.659

30:46.737 --> 30:47.845
It's three letters.

MOTHER: CPR.

30:50.574 --> 30:52.741

31:12.930 --> 31:15.780
Jillian is very pretty.
FATHER: Very pretty.

31:15.857 --> 31:17.207
MOTHER: She's very pretty.

31:17.284 --> 31:19.618
FATHER: But this is the girl you
call your "ace?"

31:19.694 --> 31:21.269
The one who always has
your back?

31:21.271 --> 31:23.939
GEORGE: Look, I know she didn't
get off to the best start, here.

31:23.941 --> 31:25.457
MOTHER: Oh, dear.

31:25.533 --> 31:27.885
The Titanic got off to
a better start.

31:27.961 --> 31:30.629
And while I am not crazy
about the idea

31:30.705 --> 31:32.297
of the two of you living
together,

31:32.374 --> 31:33.557
I don't live in the Dark Ages.

31:33.634 --> 31:35.467
I can handle it.

31:35.543 --> 31:36.727
I just didn't want to find out
the way I did.

31:36.803 --> 31:37.786
GEORGE: Mom, that's on me.

31:37.788 --> 31:40.138
I asked her not to say anything.

31:40.215 --> 31:41.881
FATHER: Loose-lips
and jittery.

31:41.959 --> 31:44.459
This is not the girl you
described to me, son.

31:44.461 --> 31:47.387
Georgie, are you sure this
is who you want

31:47.464 --> 31:49.740
sitting beside you when you
announce your campaign?

31:49.816 --> 31:52.075
GEORGE: Of course it is.

31:52.152 --> 31:54.077
She helped me get to this step,
didn't she?

31:54.154 --> 31:58.406
I plan on taking some other
steps with her as well.

31:59.401 --> 32:00.809
MOTHER: A wedding?

32:00.811 --> 32:04.087
GEORGE: Mom, now let's just keep
that on the down low.

32:04.164 --> 32:05.163
Let's not get ahead of
ourselves.

32:05.240 --> 32:06.481
MOTHER: Oh no, I won't.
GEORGE: Mom.

32:06.483 --> 32:10.485
MOTHER: Oh, promise.
GEORGE: And Dad, relax.

32:10.487 --> 32:12.154
Please, just trust me,
all right?

32:12.156 --> 32:14.656
The woman you met tonight is
not the real Jillian.

32:14.658 --> 32:17.492
Tomorrow she'll be back
to herself

32:17.494 --> 32:18.677
and you'll get to meet the
Jillian that I know

32:18.753 --> 32:20.762
and I promise you,
you will love her.

32:23.834 --> 32:25.517
Now, goodnight.

32:25.593 --> 32:26.610
FATHER: Goodnight.
MOTHER: Goodnight, dear.

32:26.687 --> 32:28.170

I'm gonna screw something up.

is gonna be ruined.

just in your head?

help me get to the bottom

of this and get rid of this

helped you get your first job

at the Brow Hut when you moved
to New York, hmmm?

kit back from your psycho ex?

Who is the only person who
believed you

36:25.208 --> 36:27.284
when we were seven and you
told our teacher

36:27.286 --> 36:28.894

it was like the Gucci version.

to that, right?

ZOE: What, like Santa channeled
through another Santa?

36:55.480 --> 36:57.071
JILLIAN: Look, I don't know,
okay?

36:57.149 --> 36:59.090
Maybe cheap Santa have an
in with Gucci Santa.

36:59.167 --> 37:00.574
I don't know, just get to
the bottom of it

37:00.652 --> 37:03.762
and find one of them and
tell them, "Message received.

37:03.838 --> 37:05.989
"Les are bad, I get it!"

37:05.991 --> 37:06.914
ZOE: Oh my God, is this really
happening?

37:06.992 --> 37:07.933
JILLIAN: Yes!

37:09.995 --> 37:11.603
(Sighing)

37:11.680 --> 37:12.553
ZOE: All right.

37:15.834 --> 37:17.275
If you become First Lady
of New York,

37:17.352 --> 37:18.426
you so better remember this.

37:18.503 --> 37:19.836
JILLIAN: If we don't figure out

37:19.838 --> 37:22.447
how to get this curse removed
before the symphony,

37:22.524 --> 37:24.115
you won't have to worry about
any of that!

37:27.846 --> 37:29.028
Bye.
ZOE: Bye.

37:40.450 --> 37:42.467
(Upbeat Music)

37:54.539 --> 37:55.647
GEORGE: There you are.

37:55.724 --> 37:56.723
Come on.

37:59.227 --> 38:00.560
Oh, Jillian, this is my sister,
Lacey,

38:00.636 --> 38:01.969
and, of course, Megan.

38:02.047 --> 38:04.047
JILLIAN: Hi, so nice to meet
you, you look pretty.

38:04.049 --> 38:06.658
MEGAN: I know.

38:06.735 --> 38:09.552
LACEY: Oh, she means thank you.
(Chuckling)

38:09.554 --> 38:11.571
LACEY: But guess what present is
all she can talk about.

38:11.647 --> 38:13.723
MEGAN: The Poppy Dot, don't you
just love it?

38:13.725 --> 38:16.242
JILLIAN: Yes, I mean everybody
just, no, I don't like it.

38:16.319 --> 38:17.669
I actually think it's annoying

38:17.746 --> 38:19.746
but it is really fun for
other people.

38:21.233 --> 38:22.248
LACEY: Okay.

38:24.252 --> 38:27.170
Odd response but it's so
nice to meet you.

38:28.590 --> 38:32.091
GEORGE: And, Jillian, this is
Lacey's husband, Ed.

38:32.168 --> 38:34.093
JILLIAN: Hi,
nice to meet you.

38:34.170 --> 38:35.412
I've heard great things
about you.

38:35.414 --> 38:36.688
ED: Oh yeah, like what?

38:36.765 --> 38:38.023
JILLIAN: Oh, that you're a
really nice guy.

38:38.099 --> 38:41.351
Mid-level achiever but you make
a great margarita.

38:43.605 --> 38:44.437
MOTHER: Breakfast.

38:44.514 --> 38:45.864
JILLIAN: Breakfast.

38:45.940 --> 38:46.364
GEORGE: Breakfast.

38:48.427 --> 38:49.092
Ed, I love your margaritas.

38:49.094 --> 38:50.927
They're the best.

38:50.929 --> 38:51.986
ED: Thanks, man.
GEORGE: Yeah.

38:55.617 --> 38:57.267
JILLIAN: I feel so bad
I overslept.

38:57.269 --> 38:59.210
Everyone's already dressed.

38:59.287 --> 39:01.287
BLAKE: Hey, not everyone.

39:01.364 --> 39:02.789
MOTHER: Good morning, dear.
BLAKE: Morning.

39:02.865 --> 39:04.698
GEORGE: Blake's not joining us
for the symphony, are you?

39:04.776 --> 39:06.885
BLAKE: Oh, George's implication
is that I don't like

39:06.961 --> 39:10.871
the symphony but I do, I just
had a previous commitment.

39:10.949 --> 39:12.615
MOTHER: Well, after tomorrow,
you two lovebirds

39:12.617 --> 39:13.558
are gonna be busy on
the campaign.

39:13.635 --> 39:16.469
I hope you were able to
get your rest.

39:16.546 --> 39:17.620
Jillian, was your room
all right?

39:17.622 --> 39:19.380
JILLIAN: Oh yes.

39:19.458 --> 39:20.565
I love getting away
from the city

39:20.642 --> 39:24.235
and this house has such
a nice, warm energy.

39:24.312 --> 39:25.962
Other than that owl painting,

39:25.964 --> 39:27.021
I really enjoyed being in
my room, thanks.

39:28.983 --> 39:29.982
GEORGE: Yeah, it's nice.

39:30.059 --> 39:31.725
It's opposite than our
aesthetic.

39:31.803 --> 39:32.744
We're minimalists.

39:32.821 --> 39:34.137
Right?

39:34.139 --> 39:35.138
JILLIAN: One of us is.

39:35.140 --> 39:36.581
GEORGE: What're you talking
about?

39:36.658 --> 39:38.917
First date, we went to that art
show, you said you loved it

39:38.993 --> 39:40.493
and you love my apartment.

39:40.570 --> 39:43.313
First time she saw it, she said
she wouldn't change a thing.

39:43.315 --> 39:44.147
She thought my taste was great.

39:44.149 --> 39:45.256
Isn't that right?

39:45.333 --> 39:46.374
JILLIAN: I lied.

39:49.579 --> 39:51.988
GEORGE: You lied?

39:51.990 --> 39:53.156
JILLIAN: I appreciate a
minimalist aesthetic,

39:53.158 --> 39:54.173
just not as much as you do

39:54.250 --> 39:55.992
and not for a home.

39:55.994 --> 39:58.603
Also, I don't think that throw
pillows are a crime.

39:58.680 --> 39:59.604
And that art show, ugh.

40:10.842 --> 40:11.524
JILLIAN: This is embarrassing.

40:13.011 --> 40:18.030
Have you ever met someone that
you liked so much

40:18.107 --> 40:20.291
that you laughed at
all of their jokes

40:20.368 --> 40:21.684
even when they weren't funny

40:21.686 --> 40:23.277
and you liked everything
that they liked

40:23.355 --> 40:25.204
and you did everything
that they did

40:25.281 --> 40:25.964
like it was the best thing ever?

40:27.375 --> 40:31.452
Well, that's kind of what
happened here.

40:31.530 --> 40:33.787
I knew who George was
when I met him.

40:33.865 --> 40:35.473
I followed his work as
a councilman

40:35.550 --> 40:36.799
and I really admired it.

40:38.461 --> 40:42.296
But little by little, I found
myself lying about things

40:42.374 --> 40:43.139
so that he would like me.

40:44.376 --> 40:45.650
I'm sorry.

40:45.727 --> 40:47.935
That's what happened, I lied.

40:55.720 --> 40:57.162
BLAKE: Sophomore year I fell for
a theater major,

40:57.238 --> 40:59.071
her name was Fiona Allen.

40:59.148 --> 41:01.908
I wasn't really into theater
but she was,

41:01.984 --> 41:05.895
so I lied and I told her
I was into theater.

41:05.897 --> 41:08.322
And then I changed my major
to Theater Arts.

41:08.400 --> 41:09.340
LACEY: Oh my God, you?

41:09.417 --> 41:10.900
Are you serious?

41:10.902 --> 41:13.753
BLAKE: Oh yeah, I would've warn
a unitard for this girl.

41:13.829 --> 41:15.087
LACEY: No.
BLAKE: It's young love.

41:15.164 --> 41:20.518
FATHER: What, he's an actor now?
MOTHER: No, dear.

41:20.595 --> 41:23.596
Bob took me to golf and then
the horse races

41:23.673 --> 41:24.747
for our first date.

41:24.749 --> 41:27.192
I hate golf and I hate
the horse races.

41:27.268 --> 41:30.102
FATHER: And I love golf and
I love the horse races.

41:30.179 --> 41:34.348
MOTHER: But I liked him so
I lied and I told him

41:34.426 --> 41:35.775
that it was the best day ever.

41:35.851 --> 41:36.943
FATHER: It was a very expensive
date.

41:37.019 --> 41:38.519
MOTHER: Oh, stop it.

41:38.597 --> 41:40.020
FATHER: Unbelievable.
MOTHER: Stop it.

41:40.098 --> 41:43.783
ED: Well, I think what you did,
Jillian, was pretty human.

41:46.438 --> 41:48.195
GEORGE: Yeah, I mean,
how could I be mad?

41:48.273 --> 41:51.865
You just did it because you fell
so hard for me, right?

41:51.943 --> 41:53.334
I think it's pretty flattering,
actually.

41:55.964 --> 41:58.205
MOTHER: George, dear.

41:58.283 --> 41:58.723
GEORGE: What?

42:01.953 --> 42:02.969
Oh.

42:04.956 --> 42:05.638
Does anyone want the
last pancake?

42:07.216 --> 42:08.224
JILLIAN: I do.

42:10.386 --> 42:11.736
GEORGE: You do?

42:11.813 --> 42:12.687
JILLIAN: I would like it
very much.

42:15.300 --> 42:16.574
GEORGE: Okay.

42:17.969 --> 42:20.637
You don't usually have
an appetite like this.

42:20.639 --> 42:21.988
Something different?

42:22.064 --> 42:24.898
JILLIAN: Oh, I do, I do have
an appetite

42:24.976 --> 42:26.084
but just not in front of you.

42:26.160 --> 42:26.751
LACEY: Why's that?

42:28.313 --> 42:30.237
JILLIAN: George likes us to look
really good in pictures,

42:30.315 --> 42:31.238
you know?

42:31.316 --> 42:32.649
The camera adds 10 pounds.

42:32.651 --> 42:34.074
We're in the limelight.

42:34.152 --> 42:36.094
MOTHER: George.
FATHER: Georgie, come on.

42:36.170 --> 42:37.987
GEORGE: Dad.

42:37.989 --> 42:38.379
BLAKE: I like a thick woman.

42:39.824 --> 42:42.267
JILLIAN: Normally I wouldn't do
anything like this.

42:42.343 --> 42:46.663
Take the last pancake or the
last anything for that matter.

42:46.665 --> 42:47.605
Too worried what people would
think of me

42:47.682 --> 42:49.089
as though I'm not allowed
to eat.

42:49.167 --> 42:51.834
You know, I'm not allowed to say
that I'm still hungry

42:51.836 --> 42:54.170
when I am, in fact,
still hungry.

42:54.172 --> 42:56.689
I'm very hungry.

42:56.766 --> 42:57.949
George ate all my sashimi
at lunch yesterday

42:58.026 --> 42:58.858
and I woke up today feeling
totally famished.

42:58.934 --> 43:01.694
MOTHER: George.
LACEY: Wow.

43:01.771 --> 43:02.603
GEORGE: She said she wasn't
hungry.

43:02.681 --> 43:04.180
JILLIAN: I lied.

43:04.182 --> 43:05.623
FATHER: There's a whole tray
of bacon.

43:05.700 --> 43:07.107
Eat the bacon, give her
the bacon.

43:07.185 --> 43:07.867
Give the sausage.

43:07.943 --> 43:09.276
ED: Just pass these down.

43:09.354 --> 43:11.129
Poor girl's hungry, come on.
FATHER: Take my juice.

43:11.205 --> 43:13.131
GEORGE: Dad, she doesn't want
your juice.

43:13.207 --> 43:14.373
JILLIAN: I want the juice,
George.

43:14.450 --> 43:15.282
FATHER: Give her the juice.

43:15.360 --> 43:16.301
GEORGE: Here, here's the juice.

43:19.364 --> 43:21.714
JILLIAN: This is amazingly
liberating

43:21.791 --> 43:23.141
to eat this much in front
of people,

43:23.217 --> 43:24.642
people I just met.

43:27.539 --> 43:29.055
ED: There you go.

43:29.131 --> 43:29.805
LACEY: Okay, well,

43:31.710 --> 43:34.727
I mean, since Jillian's being
so honest

43:34.804 --> 43:37.488
and with the campaign about
to start.

43:39.384 --> 43:41.718
Ed and I just thought it would
be a great time

43:41.720 --> 43:42.652
to get something off our chests.

43:45.815 --> 43:47.165
Okay.

43:47.241 --> 43:49.575
Remember when we eloped?

43:49.652 --> 43:50.651
MOTHER: I'll never forget it.

43:50.729 --> 43:51.911
LACEY: Okay.

43:51.987 --> 43:54.731
ED: Well, the truth is.

43:54.733 --> 43:55.665
LACEY: We aren't actually
married.

43:57.902 --> 43:58.676
MOTHER: What?
FATHER: What's that? Sorry.

43:58.753 --> 44:00.327
GEORGE: What, you're not
married?

44:00.405 --> 44:01.070
LACEY: We found out I was
pregnant with Megan

44:01.072 --> 44:02.572
when we were on vacation

44:02.574 --> 44:07.593
and we came back and we just
told everyone that we eloped.

44:07.670 --> 44:08.928
Yeah.

44:10.915 --> 44:11.931
ED: Surprise.

44:14.602 --> 44:16.361
MOTHER: Ed.

44:16.437 --> 44:16.936
BLAKE: This is where I exit.

44:18.773 --> 44:19.605
MOTHER: Did he know about this?

44:19.682 --> 44:21.532
Did you know about this?

44:21.609 --> 44:22.942
Where are you going?

44:23.018 --> 44:26.704
ED: George, since you wanted us
to campaign with you.

44:26.781 --> 44:27.688
If you were going to be
introducing me

44:27.766 --> 44:29.022
as Lacey's husband,

44:29.100 --> 44:31.267
technically that's not true, so.

44:31.269 --> 44:32.952
LACEY: No.
GEORGE: Right.

44:33.028 --> 44:35.438
Well we'll just have to run
focus numbers on this.

44:35.473 --> 44:36.105
JILLIAN: Okay.

44:36.107 --> 44:37.197
Okay.

44:37.275 --> 44:40.218
LACEY: We just thought you
should know.

44:40.294 --> 44:43.054
JILLIAN: I should probably go
and get ready.

44:43.131 --> 44:44.113
This was really great.

44:44.115 --> 44:45.448
Lovely.

44:45.450 --> 44:46.173
Biscuits were delicious.

44:48.119 --> 44:52.230
I'm just gonna get ready
for the symphony.

44:52.306 --> 44:54.957
You know, you guys are
all dressed up

44:54.959 --> 44:56.125
and you too, you're dressed
up too.

44:56.127 --> 44:57.643
You know, let me take
out the trash.

44:57.720 --> 44:59.219
Excuse me.

44:59.297 --> 45:00.738
(Laughing)

45:03.802 --> 45:05.735
(Groaning)

45:09.157 --> 45:10.239
JILLIAN: Oh, wow.

45:15.814 --> 45:16.754
BLAKE: You know, I really can't
figure you out.

45:16.831 --> 45:18.089
JILLIAN: Oh, God, here we go
again.

45:18.166 --> 45:20.817
Let me guess, you have some
thoughts to share now.

45:20.819 --> 45:22.318
BLAKE: Just when I'm positive
there's something

45:22.320 --> 45:23.761
janky about you,
you change it up.

45:25.824 --> 45:27.765
I don't get it, what is it,

45:27.842 --> 45:29.826
some kind of truth cleanse
before the campaign starts?

45:29.828 --> 45:31.936
JILLIAN: No, I just find
myself,

45:32.013 --> 45:33.429
hopefully temporarily unable
to lie.

45:36.017 --> 45:37.942
BLAKE: All right then, for my
peace of mind,

45:38.019 --> 45:40.093
is there anything shady
about you?

45:40.171 --> 45:42.171
Anything that might hurt
my brother?

45:42.173 --> 45:43.764
JILLIAN: Well,

45:43.842 --> 45:45.450
this isn't shady about me

45:45.526 --> 45:49.937
but I have done some research
into Bill Festerman,

45:50.014 --> 45:51.789
the guy who wants to
back George.

45:51.866 --> 45:53.866
I found a few things.

45:53.943 --> 45:54.959
BLAKE: Like what?

45:55.036 --> 45:56.035
JILLIAN: Cheating, fraud.

45:56.111 --> 45:57.536
Nothing that could bring
George down.

45:57.613 --> 45:59.112
I mean, he's not attached to any
of Festerman's businesses

45:59.190 --> 46:03.042
but, all-in-all, Festerman is
not a good guy

46:03.118 --> 46:03.968
and I haven't told George
any of this.

46:06.364 --> 46:09.866
It's easier that way and it's
better for the campaign.

46:09.868 --> 46:13.552
George needs Festerman and he's
gonna open the way

46:13.629 --> 46:14.929
to other big donors.

46:17.633 --> 46:18.316
BLAKE: I appreciate the candor.

46:22.046 --> 46:22.937
And you should know,

46:25.216 --> 46:26.640
even though I disagree with
George on a lot of things,

46:26.718 --> 46:27.808
I still love him.

46:27.886 --> 46:29.827
I don't think he's a bad guy
or anything.

46:29.904 --> 46:32.889
He's just always liked
the spotlight

46:32.891 --> 46:34.832
a little bit more than I have.

46:34.909 --> 46:37.335
And his head can turn
too easily,

46:37.411 --> 46:40.004
so I just wanna make sure that
he's surrounding himself

46:40.081 --> 46:41.914
with the right kind of people.

46:41.991 --> 46:42.840
JILLIAN: I am the right kind
of people.

JILLIAN: Will we?

46:47.162 --> 46:50.330
You know, George and I both
wanna change things.

46:50.408 --> 46:52.408
And we're doing something

46:52.410 --> 46:53.743
which is more than can be
said about you.

46:53.745 --> 46:55.928
I mean, George put together
a whole charity event

46:56.005 --> 46:59.006
at the symphony which you can't
even be bothered to attend.

46:59.083 --> 47:02.585

the judgmental Beauman.

47:04.422 --> 47:06.030
JILLIAN: What do you know?

You're just some guy with
a tech device,

Christmas lights.

It is the day before Christmas
in New York.

Can't you find another Santa?

GEORGE: Love those earrings.

Jillian is.

to the Poppy Dot

49:15.553 --> 49:18.888

that she knows it was wrong

49:18.890 --> 49:19.905

49:19.982 --> 49:21.815

loud and clear.

One rendition of "Jingle Bell

JILLIAN: Well,

58:39.591 --> 58:40.465
How'd you start this
whole thing?

58:42.502 --> 58:45.245
BLAKE: I was at the grocery
store just buying beer

58:45.247 --> 58:46.671
for a friend's party one night

58:46.749 --> 58:47.681
and there was this couple
behind me.

58:49.342 --> 58:51.860
And they had just gotten
off work

58:51.937 --> 58:52.644
and they were both just
whipped out.

58:54.773 --> 58:57.015
She's asking him about his back

58:57.092 --> 58:59.034
and he's asking her about their
bank account.

59:01.613 --> 59:03.205
Christmas was right around
the corner

59:03.282 --> 59:05.207
and they were talking about
how they didn't

59:05.284 --> 59:06.783
have enough money to buy
presents for their kids.

59:09.362 --> 59:11.713
It was kinda hard to hear,
you know?

59:11.790 --> 59:14.866
And I wanted to do something
or say something

59:14.943 --> 59:15.625
or help somehow

59:17.871 --> 59:21.965
but it was awkward,
so I just let it pass.

59:22.042 --> 59:23.633
JILLIAN: I mean, what can
you do?

59:23.710 --> 59:24.217
BLAKE: Right.

59:26.212 --> 59:28.955
So later that night, the party
ends up here

59:28.957 --> 59:30.899
and it's talent night
and I lose a bet

59:32.719 --> 59:35.645
and find myself up on stage

59:35.722 --> 59:38.298
trying desperately to remember
any of the lyrics

59:38.300 --> 59:40.984
to any Michael Jackson song,

59:41.061 --> 59:42.736
wishing I could be anywhere else

59:44.640 --> 59:45.581
and I look up

59:47.901 --> 59:49.901
and way in the back is
that same dad

59:49.978 --> 59:50.869
from the grocery store with
the bad back

59:52.815 --> 59:54.756
and he's busing tables.

59:54.833 --> 59:55.424
JILLIAN: No.

59:56.910 --> 01:00:01.822
BLAKE: I'm on stage and there's
a group of people here

01:00:01.824 --> 01:00:03.006
and I have a microphone
in my hand

01:00:03.083 --> 01:00:04.766
and if that's not a sign,
then what is?

01:00:08.588 --> 01:00:10.272
There was just this moment,
and for once, I took it.

01:00:12.425 --> 01:00:13.442
I pitched this

01:00:16.521 --> 01:00:17.437
and it became a thing.

01:00:18.841 --> 01:00:22.359
JILLIAN: How does George not
know about all this?

01:00:22.435 --> 01:00:24.953
BLAKE: He does, sort of.

01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:27.605
I think he just thinks about it
as a bunch of drunk people

01:00:27.683 --> 01:00:30.775
hanging out with a donation jar

01:00:30.853 --> 01:00:32.869
sitting on the bar counter,
you know?

01:00:32.946 --> 01:00:34.445
JILLIAN: But it's so much more
than that.

01:00:34.523 --> 01:00:35.780
You should share
it with him.

01:00:35.858 --> 01:00:38.800
BLAKE: Yeah, well, I'm honestly
kinda happy

01:00:38.877 --> 01:00:41.378
that it's off his radar.

01:00:41.454 --> 01:00:42.804
The last thing that I would
want is for George

01:00:42.881 --> 01:00:44.030
to swoop in, roll up his sleeves
and turn it into

01:00:44.032 --> 01:00:46.290
some kind of photo op,
you know?

01:00:46.368 --> 01:00:46.808
Just kinda kill it for me.

01:00:49.796 --> 01:00:50.887
We just roll differently.

01:00:52.207 --> 01:00:53.598

of a Christmas curse

01:03:18.186 --> 01:03:20.796
that made you have to be
honest all the time?

01:03:20.872 --> 01:03:22.964
Like imagine the family dinner,
you know?

01:03:23.041 --> 01:03:24.874
You're just like, "Hey, how's
cousin Carol?

01:03:24.951 --> 01:03:25.783
"She's in jail, pass
the cheese."

01:03:25.861 --> 01:03:27.210

sickly in the corner

just to see how much you care,
you know what I mean?

01:03:41.209 --> 01:03:44.060
It's like, "Why are you
on oxygen?"

01:03:44.137 --> 01:03:45.728
You know what I mean?

01:03:45.805 --> 01:03:46.896
JILLIAN: It's Christmas.

01:03:46.973 --> 01:03:48.156
Like it's winter time.

01:03:48.233 --> 01:03:50.659
You should be in a hospital
if it's that bad,

01:03:50.735 --> 01:03:51.551
but it's not that bad.

01:03:51.553 --> 01:03:52.310

01:03:52.387 --> 01:03:53.662

JILLIAN: My boyfriend's mom
has this weird bird fetish

01:03:59.411 --> 01:04:02.062
that has gone unchecked
for years.

01:04:02.064 --> 01:04:04.506
Like, everything in the house
has some kind of a bird on it.

01:04:04.583 --> 01:04:08.418
You know, you're sleeping on the
goose down comforter,

01:04:08.494 --> 01:04:10.086
surrounded by angry birds.

01:04:10.163 --> 01:04:13.664
It's like she's never heard
of Hitchcock at all.

01:04:13.742 --> 01:04:15.742
This is not scary at all.

01:04:15.744 --> 01:04:17.835
I went down to get some
breakfast in the kitchen.

01:04:17.913 --> 01:04:19.337
It was like, "bacaw!"

01:04:19.414 --> 01:04:23.600
Suddenly I'm in a weird diorama
of "The Land Before Time."

01:04:23.676 --> 01:04:26.528
(Laughing)

01:04:26.605 --> 01:04:30.106
JILLIAN: We're all under so much
pressure during the holidays

01:04:31.927 --> 01:04:34.352
to put on airs, you know?

01:04:34.429 --> 01:04:36.930
To try to be someone that
we think

01:04:36.932 --> 01:04:39.875
families want us to be somehow.

01:04:39.951 --> 01:04:41.376
Then there are people like
Blake, over here.

01:04:41.453 --> 01:04:44.379
Blake, he doesn't put on
airs or deodorant.

01:04:44.456 --> 01:04:45.605
(Laughing)

01:04:45.607 --> 01:04:47.048
JILLIAN: Smell you later.

01:04:49.202 --> 01:04:51.535
But, I mean, he's a good guy.

01:04:51.613 --> 01:04:53.204
I will tell you, when I first
met Blake,

01:04:53.281 --> 01:04:55.206
I thought he was an ax murderer.

01:04:55.283 --> 01:04:58.635
I mean, he's standing there,
he's hold a rusty ax.

01:04:58.711 --> 01:04:59.953
He's wearing these goggles.

01:04:59.955 --> 01:05:01.229
And you know he has that
predatory stare he does.

01:05:01.306 --> 01:05:04.566
Like he's silently judging you,
you know what I mean?

01:05:04.643 --> 01:05:06.050
(Laughing)

01:05:06.128 --> 01:05:08.186
JILLIAN: He's trying to price
your organs.

01:05:09.555 --> 01:05:11.555
No, seriously, this guy,

01:05:11.633 --> 01:05:15.744
he's got one of those soft,
chewy centers, you know?

01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:18.304
Those people have the
tough exterior

01:05:18.306 --> 01:05:20.731
but once you get behind
the hockey mask

01:05:20.809 --> 01:05:22.400
there's a really nice
guy in there.

01:05:22.477 --> 01:05:25.495
The kind of guy who sees
a family struggling

01:05:25.571 --> 01:05:27.830
and builds a whole world
out of it.

01:05:27.907 --> 01:05:30.241
That brings people together

01:05:30.318 --> 01:05:32.335
and delivers Christmas presents
to everyone.

01:05:32.412 --> 01:05:34.578
He's like a real life
Santa Claus.

01:05:34.656 --> 01:05:36.080
(Applauding)

01:05:36.158 --> 01:05:38.099
JILLIAN: All right, so let's
give it up for Blake,

01:05:38.176 --> 01:05:40.751
the ax murderer with
a heart of gold

01:05:40.829 --> 01:05:42.771
and the unidentifiable finger
prints,

01:05:42.847 --> 01:05:44.497
the guy who put us all together.

01:05:44.499 --> 01:05:46.274
(Cheering)

01:05:46.351 --> 01:05:49.169
JILLIAN: I love you, my name
is Jillian, that's my time.

01:05:49.171 --> 01:05:50.111
Goodnight.

01:05:50.188 --> 01:05:51.095
BLAKE: Yeah!

01:05:51.173 --> 01:05:53.064
(Applauding)

01:05:56.178 --> 01:05:57.360
HOST: What do we think, people?

01:05:57.437 --> 01:05:58.678
Did she top Garrett?

01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:01.456
(Cheering)

01:06:01.533 --> 01:06:02.348
HOST: Come on people,
what do you say?

01:06:02.350 --> 01:06:03.291
Who's slaying it?

01:06:03.368 --> 01:06:04.517
Garrett

01:06:04.519 --> 01:06:05.627
or Jillian?

01:06:05.704 --> 01:06:06.610
CROWD: Jillian!

01:06:06.688 --> 01:06:08.705
Jillian!

01:06:08.781 --> 01:06:09.706
CROWD: Jillian!

01:06:09.782 --> 01:06:11.282
Jillian!

01:06:11.359 --> 01:06:12.467
Jillian!

01:06:12.544 --> 01:06:14.135
Jillian!

01:06:14.212 --> 01:06:15.136
Jillian!

01:06:16.865 --> 01:06:18.139
(Cheering)

01:06:18.216 --> 01:06:21.701
HOST: That's right, this year's
coveted talent trophy

01:06:21.703 --> 01:06:23.720
goes to the lady in red,
it's Jillian!

01:06:23.796 --> 01:06:26.889
(Cheering)

01:06:26.966 --> 01:06:27.965
JILLIAN: Thank you so much!

01:06:28.043 --> 01:06:30.143
(Applauding)

01:06:33.548 --> 01:06:37.717
BLAKE: Wow, that was amazing,
how'd it feel up there?

01:06:37.719 --> 01:06:39.828
JILLIAN: So good.

01:06:39.904 --> 01:06:42.388
I just love this big trophy.

01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:43.665
BLAKE: Hey, you earned it,
congrats.

01:06:43.742 --> 01:06:45.667
JILLIAN: Thank you.

01:06:45.744 --> 01:06:49.487
You know who would not have been
thrilled by all this?

01:06:49.564 --> 01:06:50.821
George.
BLAKE: Ah.

01:06:50.899 --> 01:06:54.342
JILLIAN: He's projecting and
protecting the image

01:06:54.419 --> 01:06:55.677
all the time.
BLAKE: It's a great image.

01:06:57.072 --> 01:06:58.013
Keep it.

01:06:59.741 --> 01:07:00.673
Where did you learn how
to do that?

01:07:02.093 --> 01:07:04.335
JILLIAN: True story.

01:07:04.412 --> 01:07:08.857
I grew up in a town not much
bigger than this

01:07:08.933 --> 01:07:10.674
and those families we
helped today,

01:07:10.752 --> 01:07:12.418
that was me.

01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:16.256
My mom was a single mom pretty
much in the same predicament

01:07:16.258 --> 01:07:18.366
as that couple that
you overheard

01:07:18.443 --> 01:07:19.484
at the grocery store that day.

01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:23.038
My mom, she struggled a lot.

01:07:23.114 --> 01:07:25.098
She worked really, really hard

01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:28.434
and I felt pretty helpless
as a kid

01:07:28.436 --> 01:07:29.285
but there was one thing
that I could do.

01:07:30.789 --> 01:07:32.272
I could make her laugh.

01:07:32.274 --> 01:07:37.218
And when she laughed, I mean,
her face just lit up

01:07:37.295 --> 01:07:39.170
and all the stress just
melted away.

01:07:41.707 --> 01:07:42.548
It was the best thing
in the world.

01:07:45.136 --> 01:07:47.620
I bet it was.

01:07:47.622 --> 01:07:49.880
And then, for fun, me and
my best friend, Zoe,

01:07:49.958 --> 01:07:52.308
we used to do these ridiculous
comedy bits

01:07:52.385 --> 01:07:53.459
at the community center.

01:07:53.461 --> 01:07:55.795
BLAKE: Ah, okay.

01:07:55.797 --> 01:07:57.405
JILLIAN: Every week they had
a talent show

01:07:57.482 --> 01:07:59.632
or a contest or something

01:07:59.634 --> 01:08:01.692
and we practically lived
at that place.

01:08:03.471 --> 01:08:06.306
When I was 16, my mom
met someone

01:08:06.308 --> 01:08:09.918
and he was nice and he
had money,

01:08:09.994 --> 01:08:11.494
so suddenly I was in
private school

01:08:14.482 --> 01:08:17.741
and humor was not gonna help
me there.

01:08:17.819 --> 01:08:19.577
It was about image and status

01:08:19.654 --> 01:08:20.545
and poise.

01:08:22.657 --> 01:08:25.491
I just had to fit in with
everybody.

01:08:25.493 --> 01:08:28.937
So, little by little, I folded
up shop on who I was before

01:08:29.013 --> 01:08:32.273
and the next thing you know,
I didn't feel funny anymore.

01:08:36.504 --> 01:08:39.447
BLAKE: Well, I can tell you that
you definitely still got it.

01:08:39.524 --> 01:08:40.782
(Laughing)

01:08:40.859 --> 01:08:42.450
BLAKE: Honestly, that's
impressive just being able

01:08:42.527 --> 01:08:45.694
to bust out a performance like
that out of nowhere.

01:08:45.770 --> 01:08:47.196
JILLIAN: It's crazy but I mean,

01:08:47.273 --> 01:08:47.938
when you're out there it
just goes on

01:08:48.015 --> 01:08:49.273
like a switch, you know?

01:08:49.350 --> 01:08:52.702
BLAKE: Yeah, that's a really
good skill to have.

01:08:52.778 --> 01:08:53.627
JILLIAN: I guess so.

01:08:53.705 --> 01:08:54.203
I mean, in a way,

01:08:56.691 --> 01:08:59.524
when I met George he
was pretty much

01:08:59.527 --> 01:09:01.285
already well known in
the political sphere,

01:09:01.363 --> 01:09:03.621
so it's been helpful because
I feel like

01:09:03.698 --> 01:09:09.702
I've had to be on
the entire time.

01:09:09.703 --> 01:09:11.795
BLAKE: That's no way to live
your life.

01:09:11.872 --> 01:09:14.765
And George, I worry about him.

01:09:18.546 --> 01:09:21.397
You know, when he makes his
announcement tomorrow

01:09:21.474 --> 01:09:25.234
about his campaign with the
former mayor endorsing him

01:09:25.310 --> 01:09:26.277
and this Festerman guy
backing him,

01:09:29.482 --> 01:09:30.823
I mean, there's no coming
back from that.

01:09:32.318 --> 01:09:33.743
For either of you.

01:09:34.895 --> 01:09:37.330
(Dramatic Music)

01:09:39.751 --> 01:09:40.416
JILLIAN: George!

01:09:40.493 --> 01:09:42.993
Oh my God, the symphony!

01:09:43.071 --> 01:09:44.495
I told him I was gonna be
back to meet him!

01:09:44.572 --> 01:09:45.296
We gotta go!
We gotta go, right now!

01:09:52.764 --> 01:09:55.857
JILLIAN: Wow.
BLAKE: Looks like they're back.

01:09:55.934 --> 01:09:56.691
And then some.

01:09:58.844 --> 01:09:59.694
Why don't you go inside,
I'll park.

01:10:04.926 --> 01:10:06.201
JILLIAN: Thanks, Blake.

01:10:06.277 --> 01:10:07.360
This day was pretty great.

01:10:09.188 --> 01:10:10.205
I felt like myself.

01:10:19.365 --> 01:10:22.458
(Chuckling)

01:10:22.535 --> 01:10:24.877
(People Chattering)

01:10:27.966 --> 01:10:30.558
GEORGE: There you are,
I was getting worried.

01:10:30.635 --> 01:10:32.727
Are you feeling better?

01:10:32.804 --> 01:10:33.886
JILLIAN: I was a second ago.

01:10:37.625 --> 01:10:38.958
Mister and Misses Festerman
are here.

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:41.310
(Pleasant Music)

01:10:43.465 --> 01:10:45.222
(Somber Music)

01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:46.682
GEORGE: Yeah.

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:48.910
The Festermans were so upset
they didn't get to see you

01:10:48.987 --> 01:10:52.062
that I figured why not invite
everyone from the symphony

01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:56.309
and our neighbors back to
the house for a little party.

01:10:56.311 --> 01:10:59.403
JILLIAN: This is so unexpected.

01:10:59.481 --> 01:11:00.738
(Clearing Throat)

01:11:00.815 --> 01:11:02.906
GEORGE: Oh and I believe you
know Juan Gutierrez.

01:11:02.984 --> 01:11:04.908
I thought you could give him
a little scoop.

01:11:04.986 --> 01:11:06.486
JILLIAN: Hello, again.

01:11:06.488 --> 01:11:09.097
JUAN: You never did get back to
me on clarifying that quote.

01:11:09.173 --> 01:11:11.766
JILLIAN: That's because I was
sidestepping you, Juan.

01:11:11.843 --> 01:11:13.493
(Chuckling)

01:11:13.495 --> 01:11:14.269
BILL: Jillian!

01:11:18.166 --> 01:11:19.832
JILLIAN: I have to go to my room
right now.

01:11:19.834 --> 01:11:20.683
GEORGE: Uh.

01:11:22.504 --> 01:11:24.595
Well, when you gotta go,
you gotta go, huh?

01:11:24.672 --> 01:11:27.173
Come on, let's go have a drink.

01:11:27.175 --> 01:11:28.766
JILLIAN: Come on, pick up,
pick up!

01:11:28.843 --> 01:11:30.343
Pick up!

01:11:30.345 --> 01:11:31.527
ZOE: Jillian, what happened?

01:11:31.604 --> 01:11:33.012
Did you got to the symphony?
JILLIAN: No.

01:11:33.014 --> 01:11:34.572
I went to some charity thing and
won a trophy at a bar.

01:11:35.683 --> 01:11:36.958
ZOE: That's cool.

01:11:37.035 --> 01:11:39.368
JILLIAN: Then George went and
brought the Festermans

01:11:39.445 --> 01:11:41.871
back from the symphony along
with a reporter.

01:11:41.947 --> 01:11:43.523
ZOE: Not cool.

01:11:43.525 --> 01:11:45.708
JILLIAN: I can't lie,
I can't spin.

01:11:45.785 --> 01:11:46.784
What am I gonna do?

01:11:46.861 --> 01:11:49.529
(Knocking)

01:11:49.531 --> 01:11:51.973
GEORGE: Jillian, the Festermans
are waiting for you downstairs

01:11:52.050 --> 01:11:53.957
and so is Mr. Gutierrez.

01:11:54.035 --> 01:11:54.867
I don't understand what's going
on with you.

01:11:54.869 --> 01:11:56.126
It's like you've checked out.

01:11:56.204 --> 01:11:59.055
This is crunch time for us,
for the campaign.

01:11:59.131 --> 01:12:00.315
Are you coming down?

01:12:05.213 --> 01:12:06.562
JILLIAN: Damn it.

01:12:06.639 --> 01:12:08.397
I am getting way too
good at this.

01:12:08.474 --> 01:12:09.732
ZOE: Stop jumping out of houses.

01:12:09.809 --> 01:12:12.318
JILLIAN: It's just one house
over and over again.

01:12:13.721 --> 01:12:16.146
(Sighing)

01:12:16.224 --> 01:12:17.665
JILLIAN: I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

01:12:17.742 --> 01:12:19.408
I cannot go back in there.

01:12:19.485 --> 01:12:20.726
ED: Hey.
(Gasping)

01:12:20.728 --> 01:12:21.786
ED: What're you doing out here
without a coat?

01:12:24.899 --> 01:12:27.157
Oh, Megan left her bear
in the car.

01:12:27.235 --> 01:12:28.843
Come on, it's cold as,

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:32.996
it's cold.
JILLIAN: Uh huh.

01:12:33.074 --> 01:12:34.574
Wish me luck.

01:12:34.576 --> 01:12:35.332
ED: What was that?
JILLIAN: Huh?

01:12:35.410 --> 01:12:36.467
Oh, burr.
(Chuckling)

01:12:41.249 --> 01:12:43.849
ED: Hey, found Megan's bear
and Jillian.

01:12:46.921 --> 01:12:47.862
JUAN: Great, you're back.

01:12:49.424 --> 01:12:51.757
Miss Welles, I really need
clarification--

01:12:51.759 --> 01:12:53.183
GEORGE: There you are.

01:12:53.261 --> 01:12:55.778
JILLIAN: George, please come
outside with me right now.

01:12:55.855 --> 01:12:56.704
I've gotta tell you something.

01:12:56.781 --> 01:12:59.448
BILL: There you are, finally.

01:12:59.525 --> 01:13:01.650
Irene was beginning to think
we made you up.

01:13:01.728 --> 01:13:05.195
You're one hard lady to pin
down, Jillian.

01:13:05.273 --> 01:13:06.381
So, why so illusive?

01:13:08.868 --> 01:13:09.867
JILLIAN: I've got a file on you

01:13:09.944 --> 01:13:13.796
that I've been keeping
from George.

01:13:13.873 --> 01:13:16.715
BILL: Is there something you'd
like to ask me, young lady?

01:13:19.470 --> 01:13:20.061
JILLIAN: Yes.

01:13:21.547 --> 01:13:23.305
What is the first favor you're
gonna ask of George

01:13:23.382 --> 01:13:24.807
when he gets elected?

01:13:24.884 --> 01:13:28.218
I mean, between the lawsuits
and the girlfriends, sorry,

01:13:28.296 --> 01:13:29.629
you're not exactly the
greatest guy.

01:13:29.631 --> 01:13:32.632
I mean, five years ago, you beat
out a charter school

01:13:32.634 --> 01:13:35.818
to get that city owned barge
for your restaurant

01:13:35.895 --> 01:13:37.987
and you promised 10 scholarships
a year as a stipulation.

01:13:38.063 --> 01:13:40.397
I checked.

01:13:40.475 --> 01:13:41.657
You've never given one single
scholarship.

01:13:48.741 --> 01:13:50.758
I knew all of this and I didn't
say anything

01:13:50.835 --> 01:13:54.487
because I wanted it all so much.

01:13:54.489 --> 01:13:56.322
The big backer, the access
to other donors,

01:13:56.324 --> 01:13:59.508
the campaign, the job
opportunities, it brought you.

01:14:02.254 --> 01:14:04.254
I told myself it was
just politics.

01:14:04.332 --> 01:14:05.606
I tried to justify it.

01:14:07.259 --> 01:14:10.503
I just thought that if you
got elected

01:14:10.505 --> 01:14:11.946
we could do so much good.

01:14:12.023 --> 01:14:13.522
GEORGE: Jillian.

01:14:13.599 --> 01:14:14.523
JILLIAN: I ruined everything.

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:16.192
This whole weekend.

01:14:16.268 --> 01:14:17.860
The campaign.

01:14:17.937 --> 01:14:19.028
I'm so sorry.

01:14:19.104 --> 01:14:19.737
GEORGE: No, Jillian.

01:14:21.683 --> 01:14:22.682
Jillian!

01:14:22.684 --> 01:14:23.574
JILLIAN: I'm sorry.

01:15:26.430 --> 01:15:27.137
SANTA: Rough night?

01:15:31.085 --> 01:15:32.843
JILLIAN: I had it all right
at my fingertips.

01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:34.862
The guy, the campaign,

01:15:34.939 --> 01:15:35.771
the job interest.

01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:40.317
Now I feel like I've just
blown everything.

01:15:42.855 --> 01:15:45.264
For the record, I am sorry
I lied to the little girl.

01:15:45.266 --> 01:15:46.599
SANTA: Bethany?

01:15:46.601 --> 01:15:47.950
Don't worry about her.

01:15:48.027 --> 01:15:51.695
You wouldn't believe some of the
doozies that one told.

01:15:51.773 --> 01:15:55.291
The truth is, she didn't even
want the Poppy Dot.

01:15:55.367 --> 01:15:57.718
She just thought she did.

01:15:57.795 --> 01:15:59.536
Poppy Dot became an "it toy."

01:15:59.614 --> 01:16:01.447
The one everyone has to have.

01:16:01.449 --> 01:16:05.968
So, naturally, she thought
that's what she wanted to.

01:16:06.045 --> 01:16:07.845
She thought it would make
her happy.

01:16:09.457 --> 01:16:10.848
Happens all the time.

01:16:12.143 --> 01:16:13.309
To people of all ages.

01:16:20.802 --> 01:16:23.727
JILLIAN: Until all this
happened,

01:16:23.805 --> 01:16:24.737
I had no idea how much
I was lying to people.

01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:29.174
I thought it was just part of
the job, you know?

01:16:29.176 --> 01:16:30.418
A little spin here,
a little spin there.

01:16:32.647 --> 01:16:34.589
Saying I didn't recall when
I clearly did.

01:16:34.665 --> 01:16:36.040
Flipping the script, you know?

01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:41.879
Then, one day, spinning
just spun into lying.

01:16:44.325 --> 01:16:46.325
Thinking it was okay
to get funded

01:16:46.327 --> 01:16:47.384
by somebody like Festerman.

01:16:49.421 --> 01:16:52.014
SANTA: There are big lies
and small lies,

01:16:52.091 --> 01:16:53.757
white lies.

01:16:53.835 --> 01:16:56.935
But it's the lies we tell
ourselves that do the most harm.

01:16:58.673 --> 01:17:01.023
The ones about who we
really are,

01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:01.949
what will make us happy.

01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:07.437
Well,

01:17:07.515 --> 01:17:09.448
I've got a long night in
front of me.

01:17:12.854 --> 01:17:15.371
Merry Christmas, Jillian.

01:17:15.447 --> 01:17:16.297

01:17:25.124 --> 01:17:26.548
And if you're interested.

01:17:26.625 --> 01:17:27.642
All is not lost.

01:17:29.871 --> 01:17:32.037
All your possibilities are
still open.

01:17:32.039 --> 01:17:33.389
JILLIAN: I doubt that.

01:17:33.465 --> 01:17:37.376
Nobody's gonna believe what
happened except for Zoe.

01:17:37.378 --> 01:17:38.602
And we all know I can't lie.

you'd like.

JILLIAN: Quick,

01:18:02.904 --> 01:18:04.753
ask me what snow is made of.

01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:06.588
ZOE: What's snow made of?

01:18:06.665 --> 01:18:07.406
JILLIAN: Cheese and avocados.

But a lot of good it's gonna
do me now.

ZOE: Girl, check your
Quixxi Gram.

01:18:14.582 --> 01:18:15.748
JILLIAN: For what?

01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:16.807

is blowing up.

Is that the right term?

ringing either.

01:19:03.647 --> 01:19:04.563
It's also blowing up.

You went running out here so
fast, I wasn't mad at you.

01:19:20.648 --> 01:19:21.246
I was just surprised.

01:19:22.650 --> 01:19:25.834
And you were just doing
your job, right?

01:19:28.172 --> 01:19:30.506

time I rethought my job.

GEORGE: Well, after you exposed
Festerman for who he really was,

01:19:39.925 --> 01:19:40.891
I decided to take a gamble.

JILLIAN: You can't buy that kind
of publicity, George.

01:19:46.190 --> 01:19:47.114
You're gonna make a great mayor.

the right moment to ask you

01:19:59.186 --> 01:20:00.461
since you got here.

01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:07.693
JILLIAN: Have you noticed that
in the short time

01:20:07.695 --> 01:20:09.619
that we've been away here,

01:20:09.697 --> 01:20:11.713
when we haven't had to be on,

01:20:11.790 --> 01:20:14.049
that we really are very
different people.

01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:17.719
In a way, I feel like
you haven't

01:20:17.796 --> 01:20:19.930
gotten to meet the real me yet.

01:20:23.044 --> 01:20:26.045

gotten back in touch

01:20:30.734 --> 01:20:32.159
when I started out,

01:20:32.236 --> 01:20:38.057
what I wanted to do was be
involved and make a difference.

01:20:38.059 --> 01:20:38.949
Somehow, I lost sight of that.

01:20:41.987 --> 01:20:44.004
I don't wanna spend my life
consulting for other people.

01:20:44.081 --> 01:20:48.917
And I don't think I'm ready
to be a wife either.

01:20:51.163 --> 01:20:54.849
I need to just stand on
my own for a bit

01:20:54.925 --> 01:20:56.758
