You should know that
opportunities like that

24:09.849 --> 24:13.317
are rare for women
in this department.
(CHUCKLES)

24:14.053 --> 24:15.352
What?

24:16.622 --> 24:18.022
When I told my father I got

24:18.024 --> 24:19.723
into the police academy,
he said

24:19.725 --> 24:20.624
"That's great news.

24:20.626 --> 24:24.428
"I love you, I'm proud of you,
and you shouldn't do it."

24:24.931 --> 24:26.897
Because there
was a man out there

24:26.899 --> 24:30.100
who couldn't feed his family
because I took his spot.

24:30.102 --> 24:32.269
Opportunities like that
don't come often

24:32.271 --> 24:35.306
for a woman
in this department? (CHUCKLES)

24:35.308 --> 24:36.907
You don't say.

24:38.344 --> 24:40.411
I can get you
back undercover.

24:41.214 --> 24:42.880
You'd like that?

24:43.416 --> 24:44.982
I would.

24:45.751 --> 24:47.017
Now you're
probably worried

24:47.019 --> 24:49.386
that I'm gonna ask
for something in exchange

24:49.388 --> 24:51.288
that might make
you uncomfortable.

24:51.290 --> 24:56.393
Like maybe a date or a trip
to the evidence locker alone.

24:56.395 --> 25:00.231
After working with Sam Hodiak,
I can only imagine.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.166
You're one of the
good ones, Tully.

25:02.168 --> 25:05.035
Now, it's not fair the way
that you've been treated here.

25:05.037 --> 25:06.036
And I can fix it.

25:06.038 --> 25:10.107
But you have
to help me fix my problem.

25:18.851 --> 25:21.485
BRIAN: <i> You sneak out </i>
<i> with the dirty laundry?</i>

25:22.121 --> 25:23.787
ROY: I made a deal.

25:23.789 --> 25:25.222
Didn't figure you
a snitch.

25:25.224 --> 25:26.924
You know,
I always knew

25:26.926 --> 25:29.326
there was something
squirrelly about you, Bri,

25:29.328 --> 25:33.264
but Charmain? (SCOFFS)
She surprised me.

25:33.266 --> 25:35.032
Charmain just did
what I told her.

25:35.034 --> 25:36.800
Call her and let's ask.

25:36.802 --> 25:38.536
How'd you find me?

25:38.838 --> 25:40.971
See, him being a snitch,
that makes sense.

25:40.973 --> 25:42.673
Call Charmain,
get her down here.

25:42.675 --> 25:44.842
We can hash all this out.

25:45.745 --> 25:47.077
If you knew
where Charmain was,

25:47.079 --> 25:48.646
you wouldn't be here.

25:49.048 --> 25:51.115
If you think it'll take
more than a minute for

25:51.117 --> 25:52.316
the cops to put together

25:52.318 --> 25:56.020
you getting out
and me taking a bullet after

25:56.389 --> 25:57.621
I put you away.
I don't know.

25:57.623 --> 25:59.690
This looks like
a drug deal gone wrong to me,

25:59.692 --> 26:01.392
but what do I know?
You're the cop.

26:01.394 --> 26:02.893
(DOOR OPENS)

(WHIMPERS)

26:10.570 --> 26:14.338
Charmain.
Call for you.
Thank you.

26:18.144 --> 26:18.842
Hello? Tully.

26:18.844 --> 26:22.112
BRIAN: <i> Charmain, I need</i>
<i> your help with something.</i>

26:22.114 --> 26:23.581
<i> What's wrong?</i>

26:23.683 --> 26:25.115
Nothing, I just need you to

26:25.117 --> 26:27.618
stop by the house
as soon as possible.

26:28.054 --> 26:29.920
I'll explain
when you get here.

26:39.298 --> 26:40.297
Can I help you?
Yes.

26:40.299 --> 26:44.368
My, uh, son was taken
by police officers.

26:44.370 --> 26:48.172
His name is
Valentine Michael Manson.

26:51.310 --> 26:53.611
(SIGHS) Yes. Your son was

26:53.613 --> 26:56.380
taken because
he appeared malnourished.

26:56.616 --> 26:58.649
He wasn't wearing
warm clothing.

26:58.651 --> 27:00.517
He didn't have
a secure source of food.

27:00.519 --> 27:04.054
So, now what's gonna happen
is a social worker...

27:04.056 --> 27:06.090
Excuse me.
I am so sorry to interrupt,

27:06.092 --> 27:08.325
but there's, uh, there's been
a misunderstanding.

27:08.327 --> 27:11.395
You see, Mary, here,
is my secretary, and, I, uh...

27:11.397 --> 27:15.265
I have a strong interest in
the well-being of the child.

27:16.335 --> 27:19.370
These are plane tickets
to Wisconsin

27:19.372 --> 27:23.240
where she and the boy will be
living with his grandparents.

27:26.746 --> 27:28.646
I think I see Jesus.

27:29.415 --> 27:31.248
Charmain's on her way.

27:31.784 --> 27:34.485
Let Kristin take
Vickery to get help.

27:41.961 --> 27:44.194
You know about
the wheel of karma?

27:44.330 --> 27:46.530
Something
Charlie told me about.

27:46.799 --> 27:49.233
The wheel turns
and turns and some days,

27:49.235 --> 27:51.869
it just sends you up
to that bright starlight,

27:52.371 --> 27:56.040
and then the next,
it crushes you.

27:56.142 --> 27:59.343
(GASPS) No.
We have a daughter.

27:59.345 --> 28:01.779
She's never done
anything to anybody.

28:02.014 --> 28:04.548
She has got
no bad karma coming.

28:05.051 --> 28:06.684
Your husband does.

28:09.622 --> 28:11.121
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

28:13.926 --> 28:15.693
Let her in.

28:16.729 --> 28:18.262
Is Brian here?

28:27.740 --> 28:29.173
Hey, sugar clam.

28:37.149 --> 28:39.049
SAM: Thank you
for coming in, Mrs. Rodreick.

28:39.051 --> 28:42.653
If there's any chance you
recognize him from the camp,

28:42.655 --> 28:44.121
it would help us
in pinning down

28:44.123 --> 28:46.156
a motive for your
husband's murder.

28:46.158 --> 28:48.125
Anything I can do
to help.

28:50.496 --> 28:52.863
I've never
seen him before.

28:53.332 --> 28:55.566
Are you sure?
You want to take another look?

28:55.568 --> 28:57.000
It was a long time ago.

28:57.002 --> 28:58.569
I hoped I'd remember
the faces,

28:58.571 --> 29:00.137
but I don't. I'm sorry.

29:04.777 --> 29:07.611
Lyon's Jap killer case,
which I told you to drop,

29:07.613 --> 29:09.947
did you call
this widow in?
I did.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.685
Don't let them go.

29:15.387 --> 29:16.887
Tell me about Esther.

29:18.424 --> 29:20.691
I don't know
any Esther.

29:21.927 --> 29:25.629
You knew her
at Manzanar in 1945.

29:26.298 --> 29:28.298
You knew her
very well.

29:31.070 --> 29:32.669
Esther...

29:34.173 --> 29:36.206
Was the wife
of a guard.

29:37.276 --> 29:38.642
She volunteered to be

29:38.644 --> 29:41.445
a teacher at the school
where I worked.

29:42.281 --> 29:44.982
SAM: You and Esther
became intimate.

29:45.851 --> 29:49.319
But her husband didn't know
until after the war,

29:49.321 --> 29:52.489
when his son
was born half-Japanese.

29:54.727 --> 29:55.659
She has a son?

29:55.661 --> 29:57.895
And a very angry husband.

30:07.373 --> 30:09.173
(CRYING)
I didn't want to hurt him.

30:09.175 --> 30:12.442
SAM: No, but he wanted
to hurt you.

30:12.645 --> 30:16.013
The man who humiliated him
and disappeared.

30:18.984 --> 30:20.617
I have a son.

30:21.887 --> 30:23.754
ART: Wow, Sam.

30:25.291 --> 30:29.493
It's justifiable homicide.
Catch-and-release.

30:31.096 --> 30:31.595
Okay.

30:31.597 --> 30:34.565
I'm, uh, gonna go take
credit for this.

30:42.041 --> 30:46.043
This uniform,
it's a nice fit.

30:47.546 --> 30:49.012
Although...

30:49.381 --> 30:51.648
I think I liked
your old look better.

30:52.151 --> 30:53.217
So it's standard operating

30:53.219 --> 30:55.586

people undercover now?

30:55.588 --> 30:57.821
Or were you
breaking new ground?

30:58.023 --> 30:59.623
Maybe I loved you.

31:04.430 --> 31:07.497
Or maybe controlling my gag
reflex was part of the job.

31:07.499 --> 31:10.734
ROY: (CHUCKLES)
I know that ain't true.

31:11.670 --> 31:14.104
No one was meant
to get hurt, Roy.

31:16.208 --> 31:17.140
They did, though.

31:17.142 --> 31:20.310
If you kill us, you won't be
able to cut a deal to get off.

31:20.312 --> 31:22.779
You'll get the
death penalty for sure.

I apologize. I didn't have

you've thought maybe
if I'm a good girl,

38:04.383 --> 38:06.116
you'll gift me your job

to tell the truth
to Internal Affairs.

38:22.668 --> 38:24.901
You know,
sometimes I wonder,

38:24.903 --> 38:27.137
did I create the monster

38:27.139 --> 38:30.140
or did I just drag it
back from the swamp?

38:55.267 --> 38:57.200

happened to you.

38:57.202 --> 38:58.468
Sure you were.

38:58.470 --> 39:00.003

decaying corpse.

39:02.541 --> 39:05.475
Spare me the bull.

out of his carapace

39:13.418 --> 39:15.485
