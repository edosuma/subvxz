TO YOU. WE HAVE--

00:04.550 --> 00:07.610
- AMBER, I'M EXTREMELY
DISAPPOINTED RIGHT NOW.

00:07.660 --> 00:09.139
- THERE'S A QUESTION
I GOT TO ASK YOU.

00:09.180 --> 00:10.135
- OKAY.

00:10.180 --> 00:12.512
- ARE YOU CHANGING YOUR MIND
ABOUT THE BABY?

00:12.560 --> 00:13.549
- NO.

00:13.590 --> 00:15.171
- EVERY TIME I GO
LOOK AT A HOUSE,

00:15.220 --> 00:17.245
OKAY,
I IMAGINE YOU IN IT.

00:17.290 --> 00:19.110
YOU, ME, JABBAR.

00:19.150 --> 00:22.278
- I WANT TO MOVE IN
WITH HIM.

00:22.330 --> 00:25.083
THE HOUSE IS ACTUALLY RIGHT UP
THE STREET FROM THAT GREAT PARK

00:25.120 --> 00:29.056
WITH...YOU KNOW--
- SO YOU ALREADY FOUND A HOUSE.

00:29.090 --> 00:30.261
- SO EXCITING!

00:30.300 --> 00:31.528
[laughs]
- OKAY.

00:31.580 --> 00:33.059
KEEP GOING STRAIGHT,
KEEP GOING STRAIGHT.

00:33.100 --> 00:34.544
- OKAY.

00:34.580 --> 00:35.569
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
NOW WE CAN JUST--

00:35.620 --> 00:37.474
A LITTLE BIT TO THE RIGHT.
- UH-HUH, UH-HUH.

00:37.520 --> 00:38.612
- ALL RIGHT, I GOT YOU.

00:38.650 --> 00:40.402
THERE'S A LITTLE TIGHT
SQUEEZE HERE.

00:40.450 --> 00:41.792
- UH-HUH.
- TO THE LEFT, LEFI', LEFI'.

00:41.830 --> 00:42.797

00:47.660 --> 00:50.311
- WHOA.
- I KNOW, RIGHT?

00:50.360 --> 00:52.146
- YOU--YOU JUST PUT
THIS ALL TOGETHER?

00:52.190 --> 00:53.145
- YEAH.

00:53.190 --> 00:55.875
- YEAH, STEP INSIDE.
- WOW.

00:55.910 --> 00:56.899
- OKAY.
- I LIKE THIS.

00:56.950 --> 01:00.113
- YEAH, NOW, IT'S GOT
THESE DUAL DOORS, RIGHT?

01:00.160 --> 01:00.808
FOR CROSS-VENTILATION.
- OKAY, MM-HMM.

01:00.850 --> 01:02.397
- KEEPS IT COOL.

01:02.440 --> 01:05.125
- SO I OPEN UP
THE BACK DOOR,

01:05.160 --> 01:09.711
AND ON THE PORCH WAS A BOX
THAT I'D NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

01:09.750 --> 01:15.131
AND I OPENED UP THE BOX,
AND THERE WAS THIS NOTE,

01:15.170 --> 01:18.298
AND I READ THE NOTE,

01:18.350 --> 01:20.625
AND IT SAID...

01:20.660 --> 01:21.797
[yelling]
"WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO ME?"

01:21.840 --> 01:23.216
-_ AAH!
[glggling]

01:23.250 --> 01:25.354
YOU SUCK.
- WHAT?

01:25.390 --> 01:27.449
- YOU CAN'T TELL THAT STORY
AT YOUR SON'S CAMPING TRIP.

01:27.500 --> 01:28.489
- WHY?

01:28.530 --> 01:29.906
- BECAUSE THEY'RE
SEVEN YEARS OLD!

01:29.950 --> 01:31.156
- IT'S "G" RATED.
THERE'S NOT EVEN ANY SWEARING.

01:31.190 --> 01:32.396
- NO.

01:32.430 --> 01:34.876
- SO ARE YOU GONNA BE PUTI'ING
THIS TENT UP BY YOURSELF,

01:34.920 --> 01:37.844
OR YOU THINK CROSBY
KNOWS HOW TO DO THAT?

01:37.890 --> 01:39.391
- YOU KNOW YOU DON'T
HAVE TO WORRY.

01:39.440 --> 01:41.226
THERE'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

01:41.270 --> 01:43.500
- I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT YOU SPENDING

01:43.550 --> 01:46.849
THE NIGHT IN A TENT
WITH YOUR EX.

01:46.890 --> 01:49.927
WHY WOULD I BE WORRIED?
- [laughs]

01:49.970 --> 01:52.347
WELL, I'LL BE FINE.
- OKAY.

01:52.380 --> 01:55.827
I LOVE YOU.
- I LOVE YOU TOO.

01:57.420 --> 01:59.149
- PLEASE DON'T
BREAK MY TENT.

01:59.180 --> 02:00.829
DON'T DO IT.
- I'M NOT GONNA BREAK

02:00.870 --> 02:03.145
YOUR STUPID TENT, OKAY?
- OKAY.

02:05.570 --> 02:09.779
- YOU KNOW WHERE YOU SHOULD BE,
SARAH BRAVERMAN?

02:09.810 --> 02:11.459
UH, I THINK YOU SHOULD BE
IN NEW YORK CITY.

02:11.510 --> 02:12.818
- MM.

02:12.850 --> 02:16.160
- I THINK
YOU SHOULD MOVE

02:16.200 --> 02:19.886
TO NEW YORK CITY
WITH ME.

02:23.350 --> 02:24.749
- WHAT?

02:24.790 --> 02:27.930
- YEP.
YOU HEARD ME.

02:31.630 --> 02:34.451
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD
MOVE TO NEW YORK,

02:34.490 --> 02:36.697
AND YOU WORK
ON YOUR PLAYS.

02:36.740 --> 02:38.560
THAT'S WHERE
ALL THE THEATER IS,

02:38.600 --> 02:39.874
AND I THINK IT WOULD BE
GOOD FOR YOU,

02:39.910 --> 02:43.778
AND--
AND WE COULD JUST DO IT.

02:43.810 --> 02:47.769
- BUT WE'RE PLANNING
TO HAVE A BABY.

02:47.820 --> 02:49.435
- YES, WE ARE, AND THEY ALLOW
BABIES IN NEW YORK NOW.

02:49.470 --> 02:50.880
- NO, THEY DON'T.
- YEAH, THEY DO.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.547
I THINK IT PASSED
IN THE LAST ELECTION.

02:52.580 --> 02:55.925
- OH? WHAT ABOUT
THE CHILDREN THAT I HAVE?

02:55.960 --> 02:57.689
- THOSE CHILDREN?

02:57.720 --> 03:00.757
WELL, I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT
EVERYTHING.

03:00.800 --> 03:04.509
WE WAIT UNTIL DREW GRADUATES,
AND WE TAKE THAT TIME

03:04.560 --> 03:08.690
TO PLAN FOR IT,
AND I GET A SABBATICAL.

03:08.740 --> 03:10.287
THAT'S WHAT WE DO.

03:10.320 --> 03:13.904
- WE JUST...
MOVE TO NEW YORK CITY?

03:13.950 --> 03:16.942
- WE JUST MOVE
TO NEW YORK CITY.

03:22.020 --> 03:23.954

- AMBER, WH--WHY?
YOU LOVED IT THERE.

07:57.820 --> 07:59.845

08:49.320 --> 08:51.720
ABOUT CAMPING.
THAT HAIR DOESN'T CAMP.

08:51.770 --> 08:53.317
- YES, THIS HAIR DOES, OKAY?
- OH, REALLY?

08:53.360 --> 08:55.248
- I WAS A GIRL SCOUT,
AND WE WENT CAMPING.

08:55.290 --> 08:57.178
- OH, YOU WENT CAMPING?
- YEAH, WE DID.

08:57.220 --> 08:59.256
- WHERE AT, SUPER 8?
- [sighs]

08:59.290 --> 09:01.178
- WAIT, UM,
THERE'S ONLY ONE PILLOW.

09:01.230 --> 09:03.255
- YEAH, THAT'S BECAUSE
I'M NOT SLEEPING OVER.

09:03.300 --> 09:05.256
I'M GONNA COME BACK.

09:05.300 --> 09:07.643
- YOU'RE NOT SLEEPING
IN THE TENT WITH US?

09:07.680 --> 09:09.739
- NO, I WAS JUST GONNA GO,
HANG OUT FOR A LITTLE BIT,

09:09.790 --> 09:12.122
AND COME BACK, YOU KNOW,
JUST SPEND THE EVENING THERE.

09:12.170 --> 09:14.638
- OH, OKAY.
I THOUGHT--ALL RIGHT.

09:14.690 --> 09:17.579
- YEAH, I JUST FIGURED THAT,
YOU KNOW, THE TWO OF YOU--

09:17.620 --> 09:18.826
- OKAY.
- YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T REALLY

09:18.860 --> 09:20.134
NEED ME THERE.
- YEAH, WELL, IT'LL BE GREAT.

09:20.180 --> 09:21.340
YOU WANT TO HELP ME
CARRY SOME OF THIS STUFF?

09:21.380 --> 09:23.587
- YEAH.

09:23.630 --> 09:24.858
- WELL, I'LL CARRY
THE LIGHT STUFF.

09:24.900 --> 09:26.003
MAYBE GRAB THE SKILLETS
AND STUFF?

09:26.040 --> 09:27.598
- [laughs]

09:27.630 --> 09:29.211
[door opens]

09:29.250 --> 09:31.389
- YEAH, YEAH?
NO.

09:31.430 --> 09:33.739
OH, YES!
- [chuckles]

09:33.780 --> 09:35.702
- YES, IS THAT CHERRY?
- IT'S CHERRY.

09:35.740 --> 09:37.913
- YAY! THANK YOU, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

09:37.950 --> 09:39.087
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
- [growls]

09:39.130 --> 09:41.985
- I STOLE THIS OFF OF
THE NURSES' CART FOR YOU, SO--

09:42.020 --> 09:43.157
- [laughing] YOU?
- YEAH, HUSH.

09:43.200 --> 09:44.918
- CHERRY. THANK YOU, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

09:44.960 --> 09:47.747
MMM.

09:47.790 --> 09:49.929
[sighs]
- [laughs]

09:49.960 --> 09:51.200
- THIS IS AMAZING.

09:51.240 --> 09:52.343
WHY DON'T THEY LET YOU EAT
DURING LABOR?

09:52.380 --> 09:54.826
I FEEL SO WEAK.
- I KNOW.

09:54.870 --> 09:56.064
IT'S IN CASE THERE'S,
YOU KNOW,

09:56.110 --> 09:58.726
ANY REASON
FOR AN EMERGENCY SURGERY.

09:58.770 --> 10:01.341
YOU DON'T WANT TO CHOKE
DURING ANESTHESIA.

10:01.390 --> 10:04.109
OKAY...
YOU ARE GONNA BE FINE.

10:04.150 --> 10:06.971
THIS BABY'S GONNA COME OUT
THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY.

10:07.020 --> 10:08.214
EAT YOUR ICEE.

10:08.260 --> 10:10.285
- YEAH, ENJOY THE ICEE.
- COME ON.

10:10.330 --> 10:13.117
- GONNA GO IN EMERGENCY SURGERY.
JUST ENJOY YOUR ICEE.

10:13.160 --> 10:15.048
- JOEL STOLE, LIKE,
TEN OF THOSE FOR ME

10:15.090 --> 10:16.079
WHEN I WAS HAVING SYDNEY.

10:16.130 --> 10:17.336
- REALLY?
- MM-HMM.

10:17.370 --> 10:19.782
- [laughing] JOEL?
- MM-HMM.

10:19.820 --> 10:22.641
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

10:22.690 --> 10:25.067
- JOEL SEEMS LIKE HE'D BE, LIKE,
A REALLY GOOD GUY TO HAVE

10:25.100 --> 10:26.681
IN THIS SITUATION.

10:26.720 --> 10:30.304
- HE WAS AMAZING.
HE WAS.

10:30.350 --> 10:31.442
- WAS IT JUST YOU GUYS?

10:31.490 --> 10:34.835
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
MY CRAZY FAMILY?

10:34.870 --> 10:37.077
IT WAS LIKE A REVOLVING DOOR
IN HERE.

10:37.110 --> 10:38.145
- [chuckles]
- SERIOUSLY.

10:38.180 --> 10:39.420
AT ONE POINT,
I SWEAR, THERE WERE

10:39.460 --> 10:41.109
A DOZEN PEOPLE IN HERE,

10:41.150 --> 10:43.141
AND EVERYONE JUST THINKS
THAT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE FINE

10:43.190 --> 10:45.658
WITH HAVING MY KNEES
POINTED AT OPPOSITE CONTINENTS,

10:45.710 --> 10:49.259
WITH ALL OF THEM
AND JUST THE SHEET.

10:49.300 --> 10:50.460
- EW.
[laughs]

10:50.510 --> 10:52.956
- BUT THAT'S THE BRAVERMANS,
YOU KNOW?

10:52.990 --> 10:55.959
TRY AND KEEP 'EM OUT.

10:59.310 --> 11:03.269
WHAT'S UP?

11:03.310 --> 11:07.349
- I NEVER EVEN TOLD MY MOM
AND MY SISTER I WAS PREGNANT.

11:10.840 --> 11:13.832
I JUST--

11:17.090 --> 11:18.182
SINCE I WASN'T
KEEPING IT,

11:18.220 --> 11:22.054
I DIDN'T THINK
THERE WAS A POINT.

11:26.850 --> 11:28.818
- I'M SORRY.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.060
- OKAY.

11:32.100 --> 11:35.137
IT'S TIME. WE'RE GONNA MOVE YOU
INTO THE DELIVERY ROOM NOW.

11:35.170 --> 11:37.035
- NO.

11:37.070 --> 11:39.061
- YOU'LL BE FINE. IT'S OKAY.
- NO, I'M NOT READY.

11:39.110 --> 11:40.759
I'M NOT READY.
PLEASE, NO.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.176
PLEASE, CAN I JUST STAY HERE?
- ZOE, HEY, HEY, IT'S OKAY.

11:42.210 --> 11:45.213
- I DON'T WANT TO GO.
I DON'T WANT TO GO.

11:45.250 --> 11:47.309
- WELL, AMBER QUIT.
WHAT HAPPENED?

11:47.360 --> 11:51.114
- SHE--
OKAY, UM...

11:51.150 --> 11:53.118
SHE TOLD YOU SHE QUIT?

11:53.160 --> 11:54.912
- OH, WAS SHE FIRED?
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

11:54.950 --> 11:56.918
1--
NO, SHE WASN'T FIRED.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.190
- WHAT HAPPENED?

11:58.230 --> 12:00.016
- CAN YOU CLOSE THE DOOR?
- OH, SORRY, YEAH.

12:00.060 --> 12:02.335
- UM...

12:04.030 --> 12:05.543
- OH, GOSH. WHAT IS IT?
- OKAY.

12:05.580 --> 12:07.957
THIS IS GONNA BE VERY AWKWARD
TO SAY TO YOU.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.413
AMBER, UM--AMBER AND BOB
WERE ABOUT TO HAVE AN AFFAIR.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.002
BOB LITTLE,
HER BOSS.

12:18.910 --> 12:20.764
- NO, HE'S NOT MARRIED.
- OH.

12:20.800 --> 12:22.836
WHEN YOU SAID, "AFFAIR,"
I THOUGHT--

12:22.880 --> 12:24.142
- YEAH, THEY WERE ON A...
- THAT'S NOT--

12:24.190 --> 12:25.942
THEY WERE JUST ABOUT TO--
- BUSINESS TRIP.

12:25.980 --> 12:27.493
THEY WERE ON THE VERGE.
THEY WERE ON A BUSINESS TRIP...

12:27.530 --> 12:28.940
- OH, GOD.
- UP IN SACRAMENTO.

12:28.980 --> 12:29.844
- YEAH.

12:29.880 --> 12:32.326
- AND I WENT UP THERE
BECAUSE HADDIE

12:32.370 --> 12:33.917
HAD TIPPED ME OFF WITH
SOME INFORMATION.

12:33.960 --> 12:35.769
- WAIT.
- SO I WENT UP THERE, JUST--

12:35.820 --> 12:38.095
I KNOW, I KNOW, AND I WENT IN...
- NO, NO, I'M SORRY, WAIT.

12:38.130 --> 12:41.099
- AND I SAW THEM HALF-UNDRESSED,
SO I TOOK HER HOME...

12:41.130 --> 12:42.165
- WAIT, BECAUSE--
- AND NOW SHE WON'T

12:42.200 --> 12:43.963
COME BACK TO WORK,
AND I'M DEVASTATED FOR HER.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.868
- I'M SORRY.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.174
- I'M S--

12:49.210 --> 12:51.098
- SO THEY LIKE EACH OTHER?
- I DON'T--NO.

12:51.140 --> 12:52.937
SARAH,
I WENT THERE TO STOP IT.

12:52.970 --> 12:54.005
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A CAMPAIGN,

12:54.040 --> 12:55.041
AND I'M TRYING
TO PROTECT AMBER.

12:55.080 --> 12:55.899
- SO THE CAMPAIGN
IS IN TROUBLE

12:55.940 --> 12:58.420
IF HE GOES ON A DATE
WITH SOMEBODY?

12:58.460 --> 13:00.109
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
- YOU SHOULDN'T DATE YOUR BOSS.

13:00.150 --> 13:01.139
- SHE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG
AT WORK.

13:01.190 --> 13:02.976
- IT'S ALL INTERTWINED.
IT'S ALL INTERMINGLED.

13:03.020 --> 13:04.112
- NO, NO, IT'S NOT.
IT'S NOT.

13:04.160 --> 13:05.604
- SARAH, HE'S 28 YEARS OLD--
- IF SHE'S GONNA LEARN

13:05.640 --> 13:07.153
THAT IT'S NOT RIGHT
TO DATE YOUR BOSS,

13:07.200 --> 13:08.428
SHE'S GONNA LEARN IT
ON HER OWN.

13:08.470 --> 13:10.119
- I DIDN'T WANT HER
TO MAKE A MISTAKE, OKAY?

13:10.160 --> 13:11.479
- I DON'T WANT HER
TO MAKE A MISTAKE, EITHER.

13:11.510 --> 13:13.091
I'M HER MOTHER.
- PLEASE KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.

13:13.130 --> 13:14.119
- SHE'S GOT TO MAKE
HER OWN MISTAKES, DOESN'T SHE?

13:14.170 --> 13:15.330
- LOWER YOUR VOICE,
PLEASE.

13:15.380 --> 13:17.063
- I'M SORRY.
- YOU SHOULD PROBABLY LEAVE.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.965
I THINK WHAT YOU MEANT TO SAY
WAS, "THANK YOU SO MUCH

13:19.000 --> 13:20.035
FOR LOOKING OUT
FOR MY DAUGHTER,"

13:20.070 --> 13:21.992
BECAUSE IF IT WERE HADDIE,
I WOULD HOPE TO GOD

13:22.040 --> 13:23.519
YOU'D DO THE SAME THING
FOR ME, OKAY?

13:23.560 --> 13:26.108
I'M AT WORK RIGHT NOW.

13:26.150 --> 13:27.526
- WET WIPES.

13:27.560 --> 13:31.974
GOTTA HAVE WET WIPES
ON A CAMPING TRIP

13:32.010 --> 13:32.977
- HEY.
- HEY.

13:33.010 --> 13:34.489
- COULD WE TALK?
- UH, YEAH.

13:34.530 --> 13:35.599
I'M LEAVING IN A SECOND,
BUT WHAT IS IT?

13:35.640 --> 13:39.292
- YEAH. UH, I JUST
WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT OFFER.

13:39.330 --> 13:42.959
- YEAH, THAT WAS CRAZY, HUH?
- YEAH, THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY.

13:42.990 --> 13:47.541
- YEAH, LOT OF MONEY.

13:47.580 --> 13:49.195
AND WHAT?

13:49.240 --> 13:52.061
- AND I FULLY UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO SELL.

13:52.100 --> 13:55.376
BUT I FEEL LIKE WE
AT LEAST NEED TO DISCUSS IT.

13:55.420 --> 13:57.479
- UH, THERE'S NOTHING
TO DISCUSS.

13:57.520 --> 13:59.203
- WELL, THAT'S NOT
ENTIRELY THE CASE.

13:59.250 --> 14:01.343
THERE IS SOMETHING TO DISCUSS
BECAUSE I'M A PARTNER,

14:01.390 --> 14:02.596
AND I WANT TO DISCUSS IT.
- OKAY.

14:02.630 --> 14:05.144
WELL,
I DON'T WANT TO DISCUSS IT.

14:05.180 --> 14:07.216
- CROSBY. HEY!
- WHAT?

14:07.260 --> 14:09.399
- WELL, THAT IS NOT COOL.

14:09.430 --> 14:11.182
- OH, THAT'S NOT COOL?
- UH-UH.

14:11.220 --> 14:13.427
- WHAT IS COOL, ADAM?
PUTTING A PRICE TAG ON MY DREAM?

14:13.470 --> 14:15.438
- OH, COME ON, YOU CAN'T JUST
THROW YOUR "DREAM" OUT THERE.

14:17.920 --> 14:18.989
AND I WOULD LIKE
TO DISCUSS THIS.

14:19.030 --> 14:20.258
- WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT? YOU WANT TO SELL?

14:20.300 --> 14:22.882
YOU WANT TO SELL A PLACE WE
JUST BUILT WITH OUR OWN HANDS?

14:22.930 --> 14:24.989
- I MIGHT.
- IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN!

14:25.030 --> 14:26.440
OKAY?
THIS DISCUSSION'S OVER.

14:26.480 --> 14:28.687
- ALL RIGHT, WOW.
WELL, THIS IS VERY MATURE.

14:28.720 --> 14:30.449
- MATURITY HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS, OKAY?

14:30.490 --> 14:33.516
YOU KNOW HOW STUPID IT WOULD BE
IF WE SOLD RIGHT NOW?

14:33.560 --> 14:35.175
I MEAN, WHY DO YOU THINK
THEY WANT TO BUY IT?

14:35.210 --> 14:37.417
BECAUSE WE'RE DOING GREAT
AND THEY'RE AFRAID OF US.

14:37.460 --> 14:39.178
- IT'S NOT STUPID,
AND THEY'RE NOT AFRAID OF US,

14:39.220 --> 14:40.448
CROSBY, ALL RIGHT?
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

14:40.500 --> 14:42.559
HOW DIFFICULT IT WOULD BE FOR US
TO CLEAR A $1 MILLION HERE?

14:42.600 --> 14:44.181
DO YOU?
- I DON'T CARE ABOUT $1 MILLION.

14:44.220 --> 14:45.289
OKAY?
- OH, YOU DON'T?

14:45.330 --> 14:47.048
- I LOVE THIS PLACE.
I THOUGHT YOU LOVED IT TOO.

14:47.090 --> 14:49.183
I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA
WORK HERE UNTIL WE WERE DONE!

14:49.230 --> 14:52.199
- I LOVE IT HERE TOO, CROSBY,
BUT I HAVE FINANCIAL PROBLEMS

14:52.230 --> 14:54.152
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SOLVE,
AND YOU KNOW THIS.

14:54.200 --> 14:55.679
ALL RIGHT?
I'VE PUT MY FAMILY THROUGH HELL,

14:55.720 --> 14:58.029
I BURNED THROUGH OUR SAVINGS
PUTTING THIS PLACE TOGETHER,

14:58.060 --> 15:00.028
AND NOW YOU'RE TRYING
TO UNILATERALLY DECIDE

15:00.070 --> 15:01.025
WHAT WE'RE DOING, AND IT'S
NOT GONNA GO DOWN THAT WAY.

15:01.070 --> 15:03.959
- I'M NOT SELLING.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.310
- JUST STAY HERE AND TRY TO HAVE
A TALK WITH ME ABOUT IT!

15:07.350 --> 15:09.170
THANKS A LOT.

15:15.500 --> 15:16.353
- ON THREE!
THREE, TWO.

15:16.390 --> 15:19.279
[grunts] BOOM!
- UH.

15:19.330 --> 15:21.707
- NOW, THAT'S A TENT.
COME ON, RIGHT?

15:21.740 --> 15:23.082
HUH?

15:23.120 --> 15:25.509
- WHY IS IT LOPSIDED?
IT'S LOPSIDED.

15:25.540 --> 15:27.269
- HUH.

15:27.300 --> 15:29.336
MAYBE I'M MISSING A POLE
OR SOMETHING.

15:29.370 --> 15:32.123
- OH, MISSING--
I THOUGHT YOU HAD ALL THE POLES.

15:32.170 --> 15:33.398
- OH, YEAH.
- YEAH.

15:33.440 --> 15:35.305
YOU--IT'S VERY FUNNY, HUH?
- YES, YES, YES.

15:35.340 --> 15:37.092
I THINK IT'S VERY FUNNY.
- THE POLE POLICE.

15:37.140 --> 15:38.619
- [laughs]
- I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

15:38.660 --> 15:42.414
I'LL JUST TIGHTEN SOME STUFF.
- [sighs]

15:42.450 --> 15:48.173
UM, WHAT ABOUT THE TAPE?
WHAT HAPPENS IF IT RAINS?

15:48.220 --> 15:49.357
- IT'S DUCT TAPE.

15:49.390 --> 15:51.119
IT'S NOT GONNA
GO THROUGH DUCT TAPE.

15:51.150 --> 15:53.254
- REALLY?
- YES, THIS IS MAGIC TAPE.

15:53.290 --> 15:55.349
- I MEAN,
I CAN JUST GET JOE'S TENT.

15:55.400 --> 15:56.981
IT'S IN THE BACK OF MY CAR.
IT'S BRAND-NEW.

15:57.020 --> 15:59.397
- LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO SLEEP
IN ANOTHER MAN'S TENT.

15:59.440 --> 16:02.432
IT'S WEIRD.

16:05.340 --> 16:07.433
- HOW'S EVERYTHING BEEN
AT THE LUNCHEONETTE?

16:07.480 --> 16:09.789
- OH, IT'S GREAT, EXCEPT
FOR ADAM WANTS TO SELL IT.

16:09.830 --> 16:11.092
- WHAT?
WHY?

16:11.140 --> 16:13.415
- WE GOT AN OFFER
FOR $1 MILLION.

16:13.450 --> 16:15.441
- $1 MILLION?
THAT'S AMAZING.

16:15.490 --> 16:18.129
- WHAT, DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD SELL IT TOO?

16:18.180 --> 16:20.171
- NO.

16:20.220 --> 16:22.006
I KNOW HOW MUCH THAT PLACE
MEANS TO YOU,

16:22.050 --> 16:24.075
AND YOU CAN'T PUT A PRICE
ON SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

16:24.120 --> 16:25.428
IT'S LIKE YOUR HOME.

16:25.460 --> 16:29.738
I DON'T THINK
YOU SHOULD EVER SELL IT.

16:29.780 --> 16:32.089
- THANK YOU.

16:32.120 --> 16:35.157
[phone rings]

16:35.200 --> 16:36.360

I GOT TO CHASE YOU DOWN

16:42.690 --> 16:44.408

UH, YEAH, WELL, LISTEN.

16:44.450 --> 16:46.270
WE REALLY APPRECIATED
THAT OFFER,

16:46.310 --> 16:48.301
BUT IT STILL LOOKS LIKE
WE'RE NOT GONNA SELL.

16:48.350 --> 16:50.068
SO...
- "LOOKS LIKE"?

16:50.110 --> 16:52.317
- LISTEN, I'M NOT GONNA--
I'M NOT GONNA LIE TO YOU.

16:52.350 --> 16:58.038
WE, UH--WE TALKED ABOUT IT,
AND MY BROTHER'S JUST--

16:58.080 --> 17:01.766
HE'S VERY ADAMANT.
HE DOES NOT WANT TO SELL.

17:01.810 --> 17:04.563
- BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU MIGHT.

17:04.600 --> 17:06.181
- I WAS THINKING
ABOUT IT,

17:06.230 --> 17:08.369
HONESTLY, BUT THAT'S
BESIDE THE POINT.

17:08.400 --> 17:11.392
THE POINT IS...
IT IS NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

17:11.440 --> 17:12.748
- LISTEN, WHY DON'T YOU COME
MEET ME FOR A DRINK TONIGHT?

17:12.790 --> 17:14.337
I'LL BE BACK AT DALTON'S
AROUND 9:00.

17:14.370 --> 17:17.089
- I CAN'T DO THAT.
CROSBY'S NOT AVAILABLE TONIGHT.

17:17.130 --> 17:19.542
- SO JUST COME BY YOURSELF.

17:19.590 --> 17:21.342
- I CAN'T DO THAT.
THAT'S NOT HOW I DO BUSINESS.

17:21.380 --> 17:22.654
HE'S MY BUSINESS PARTNER.
HE'S MY BROTHER.

17:22.690 --> 17:24.271
I WON'T DO THAT TO HIM.

17:24.310 --> 17:27.552
- OH, JEEZ, BRAVERMAN, COME ON.
YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD GUY.

17:27.590 --> 17:30.070
CALM DOWN.
WE'RE IN THE SAME BUSINESS.

17:30.110 --> 17:32.214
WE'RE GONNA GO OUT,
HAVE A DRINK.

17:32.250 --> 17:34.525
EVERYBODY'S PANTS
ARE GONNA STAY ON, RELAX.

17:34.570 --> 17:36.458
- [laughs]
ALL RIGHT.

17:36.500 --> 17:38.354
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, I CAN DO THIS.

17:38.400 --> 17:40.493
I'LL SEE YOU
AT DALTON'S AT 9:00, RIGHT?

17:40.540 --> 17:42.462
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL SEE YOU THERE.

17:42.500 --> 17:43.467
ALL RIGHT, BYE.

17:43.510 --> 17:44.602
[phone keypad beeps]

17:47.410 --> 17:49.435
- [groaning]
- BREATHE. BREATHE. BREATHE.

17:49.480 --> 17:51.573
ZOE, BREATHE.

17:51.620 --> 17:55.306
IT'S GONNA END, OKAY?
I PROMISE.

17:55.350 --> 17:57.853
- OH!
[breathing heavily]

17:57.900 --> 18:01.449
OW! OW.
- KEEP BREATHING, OKAY?

18:01.490 --> 18:04.414
JUST--ALL RIGHT.
OKAY.

18:04.460 --> 18:06.212
- YOU DIDN'T SAY
IT WAS GONNA HURT LIKE THIS,

18:06.250 --> 18:07.456
AND YOU SHOULD HAVE
TOLD ME.

18:07.500 --> 18:09.695
- THERE'S REALLY NOTHING
TO COMPARE IT TO.

18:09.740 --> 18:12.322
I'M SORRY--
- HOW ABOUT "HELL ON EARTH"?

18:12.360 --> 18:14.419
HOW ABOUT THAT?
- OKAY.

18:14.470 --> 18:16.563
- [sobs]

18:16.610 --> 18:18.191
[whispering]
I'M GONNA DIE.

18:18.230 --> 18:20.152
IT'S GONNA KILL ME,
AND I'M GONNA DIE.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.782
- ZOE.
- I'M GONNA DIE.

18:22.820 --> 18:24.333
- LISTEN TO ME,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DIE.

18:24.370 --> 18:26.190
- I CAN'T DO THIS.

18:26.240 --> 18:27.514
- YOU CAN DO THIS.

18:27.550 --> 18:30.678
I KNOW YOU,
AND I PROMISE,

18:30.730 --> 18:35.178
IT'S NOT GONNA KILL YOU,
OKAY?

18:35.210 --> 18:38.555
YOU'RE REALLY BRAVE.

18:38.600 --> 18:42.593
[choked up]
YOU'RE SO BRAVE.

18:48.330 --> 18:50.491
- [sighs]

18:50.540 --> 18:52.883
I LOVE YOU.

18:58.510 --> 19:01.638
- ME TOO, SWEETIE.

19:01.690 --> 19:04.682
- [cries]

19:13.250 --> 19:15.866
- HI.
- HEY.

19:15.910 --> 19:17.354
- MAY I COME IN?
- YEAH.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.381
- YEAH?
- COME ON IN.

19:19.430 --> 19:22.285
HOW YOU DOING?
- ALL RIGHT. HOW ARE YOU DOING?

19:22.330 --> 19:24.878
- JUST WHIPPING UP A NEW DISH.
- OH, YEAH?

19:24.920 --> 19:26.501
- CHICKEN PAPRIKASH.

19:26.540 --> 19:27.507
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF THAT'S HOW YOU SAY IT

19:27.540 --> 19:30.646
BUT A LITTLE EXPERIMENT,
I GUESS.

19:30.680 --> 19:32.671
HOW'S IT GOING?
- LISTEN, I'M SORRY.

19:32.720 --> 19:33.812
- I AM SO SORRY.
- I KNOW, I'M REALLY SORRY.

19:33.860 --> 19:35.122
- I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
THAT HAPPENED.

19:35.170 --> 19:36.091
- IT WAS JUST INSANE, THERE WAS
NO REASON FOR IT TO GO THERE.

19:38.310 --> 19:39.470
- SARAH, I OVERREACT ED.
- NO, IT WAS...

19:39.520 --> 19:41.272
- I DID.
- WONDERFUL WHAT YOU DID.

19:41.310 --> 19:42.413
IT WAS HEROIC AND BRAVE...
- I SHOULD NEVER

19:42.450 --> 19:43.485
HAVE DRIVEN THERE
TO SACRAMENTO.

19:43.520 --> 19:44.748
- AND I WAS THANKFUL,
ACTUALLY,

19:44.800 --> 19:46.893
BUT, YOU KNOW, I'VE HAD THIS
WORRY LATELY ABOUT THE KIDS...

19:46.940 --> 19:48.976
- I'VE BEEN SICK TO MY STOMACH,
YOU KNOW?

19:49.010 --> 19:51.934
- BECAUSE I'M THINKING OF MAYBE
MOVING TO NEW YORK.

19:51.980 --> 19:54.426
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
I JUST--

19:54.460 --> 19:55.973
HAVE A SEAT, FIRST OF ALL,
AND BACK IT UP.

19:56.020 --> 19:57.738
YOU'RE GONNA MOVE TO NEW YORK.
- NO, I DON'T KNOW.

19:57.780 --> 19:59.566
- WHEN ARE YOU GONNA MOVE
TO NEW YORK?

19:59.610 --> 20:02.636
- WELL, MARK AND I WERE TALKING
ABOUT THIS FANTASY,

20:02.680 --> 20:04.022
YOU KNOW, OF GOING TO NEW YORK
AFTER DREW GRADUATES

20:04.060 --> 20:05.095
AND HOPEFULLY GOES
TO COLLEGE.

20:05.130 --> 20:08.338
AND I COULD WRITE,
AND I KNOW A PRODUCER THERE,

20:08.370 --> 20:09.928
AND MARK'S ALWAYS WANTED
TO TEACH THERE.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.063
AND SO IT'S ON MY MIND,

20:11.100 --> 20:13.512
AND ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT IS,
"ARE THE KIDS OKAY?

20:13.550 --> 20:15.689
ARE THEY GOING
TO BE OKAY?"

20:15.730 --> 20:17.413
- SARAH, GO TO NEW YORK.

20:17.450 --> 20:20.271
WRITE PLAYS, LIVE TOGETHER,
LIVE IN A BROWNSTONE,

20:20.320 --> 20:21.389
AND THE KIDS
ARE GONNA BE FINE.

20:21.420 --> 20:22.648
AMBER WILL LOOK UP
TO YOU

20:22.700 --> 20:24.452
AND THINK IT'S
THE GREATEST THING IN THE WORLD.

20:24.490 --> 20:26.310
AND SHE'LL HAVE
THE UTMOST RESPECT FOR YOU.

20:26.360 --> 20:27.668
AND DREW--
WELL, DREW--

20:27.700 --> 20:29.019
WHO KNOWS WHAT HE'S THINKING
HALF THE TIME?

20:29.050 --> 20:30.392
BUT I THINK
YOU SHOULD DO IT.

20:30.430 --> 20:33.490
JUST BE HAPPY, OKAY?
YOU DESERVE IT.

20:33.540 --> 20:35.531
GO TO NEW YORK.

20:35.570 --> 20:38.016
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

20:38.060 --> 20:40.813
- YEAH.

20:40.860 --> 20:43.431
- WOW.

20:43.480 --> 20:45.687
- CROSBY, I DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU THINK THAT MARSHMALLOW'S

20:45.720 --> 20:47.824
GONNA GET HOT
THAT FAR AWAY FROM THE FLAME.

20:47.860 --> 20:50.374
- YOU KNOW, YOU WORRY ABOUT
YOUR OWN MARSHMALLOW, ALL RIGHT?

20:50.420 --> 20:52.342
I GOT THE SUPREME TECHNIQUE
RIGHT HERE.

20:52.380 --> 20:53.961
IF YOU GET IT AS CLOSE
AS YOURS IS, IT'S GONNA BURN.

20:54.010 --> 20:57.832
- YEAH, BUT A LITTLE BURN
ON THE OUTSIDE IS GOOD.

20:57.870 --> 21:00.282
SO THE INSIDE--
GET IT NICE AND SOFT.

21:00.320 --> 21:01.355
- WHAT DO YOU--
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

21:01.390 --> 21:02.379
YOU THINK--
WHO'S DOING THIS RIGHT?

21:02.430 --> 21:03.397
- ME AND YOU.
- YOU?

21:03.430 --> 21:04.874
- AND YOU.

21:04.910 --> 21:06.047
- YEAH, HE'S THE ONE WHO TOOK
CAMPING CLASSES, HE KNOWS.

21:06.090 --> 21:08.490
- I KNOW HOW TO CAMP.
I WAS A GIRL SCOUT, REMEMBER?

21:08.540 --> 21:09.746
- OH, REALLY?
- YEAH, I KNOW

21:09.780 --> 21:10.633
HOW TO ROAST MARSHMALLOWS.
- THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT.

21:10.680 --> 21:12.466
- I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.
- IT'S ON FIRE!

21:12.510 --> 21:15.673
- FIRE, FIRE!
- BLOW IT OUT.

21:15.720 --> 21:18.029
LOOK AT THAT THING.
- OH, IT LOOKS NASTY.

21:18.060 --> 21:19.925
- I MEANT TO DO THAT.
- [laughing] YEAH.

21:19.960 --> 21:21.404
OH, YOU'RE GONNA EAT THAT NOW?
- I AM.

21:21.450 --> 21:22.303
- OH, REALLY?
I WANT TO SEE THIS.

21:22.350 --> 21:23.578
- MM-HMM, MM-HMM.
- OH, HERE WE GO.

21:23.620 --> 21:24.609
- AAH!
- WHAT?

21:24.660 --> 21:26.935
- OW!
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

21:26.970 --> 21:28.790
OH, GOD, DID YOU JUST
BURN YOUR HAND?

21:28.830 --> 21:30.343
LET ME SEE, LET ME SEE.
- [groans]

21:30.390 --> 21:32.415
- OOH.
- OH, YOU REALLY DID IT, HUH?

21:32.460 --> 21:34.382
YEAH, THAT'S, LIKE,
A FIRST-DEGREE BURN.

21:34.430 --> 21:35.977
MAYBE SECOND-DEGREE BURN.

21:36.010 --> 21:37.898
- THERE'S FIRST AID
IN MY TEACHER'S CAR.

21:37.950 --> 21:39.110
- OH, NO,
WE'RE NOT GONNA USE THAT.

21:39.150 --> 21:40.390
WE GOT
A BRAVERMAN FIRST-AID KIT.

21:40.430 --> 21:42.466
LET'S GO.
I'LL FIX YOU UP.

21:42.500 --> 21:43.603
- STAY HERE.
- YEAH, YEAH.

21:43.640 --> 21:44.675
DON'T GO OUT IN THE WOODS
OR ANYTHING.

21:44.710 --> 21:46.018
THERE'S GRIZZLY BEARS
OUT THERE.

21:46.060 --> 21:48.369
- THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

21:49.440 --> 21:51.089
OKAY.

21:54.410 --> 21:56.378
MM-HMM, MM-HMM.

21:56.410 --> 21:58.651
GIVE ME
A LITTLE SPACE HERE.

21:58.690 --> 22:01.511
OH, YEAH.
THERE WE GO.

22:01.560 --> 22:03.346
YOU GOT TO RESPECT
THIS KIT.

22:03.390 --> 22:05.654
THAT'S THE BRAVERMAN KIT.
- [laughs]

22:05.700 --> 22:07.452
- OOH,

22:09.910 --> 22:12.902
OH, SORRY, SORRY, SORRY.

UH-HUH.

22:17.430 --> 22:19.500

TAPING A HOCKEY STICK.

22:19.540 --> 22:20.814

OKAY, THERE'S THAT.

22:31.550 --> 22:33.131
HOLD ON.
HOLD, HOLD, HOLD.

22:33.170 --> 22:37.413
MAKE THIS LOOK
LESS WONKY.

22:38.800 --> 22:41.360
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
YOU DON'T LIKE IT?

22:43.180 --> 22:45.876
- NO, IT'S GOOD.

22:45.910 --> 22:49.494
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

22:49.540 --> 22:52.532
- I GOT TO TELL JABBAR
ABOUT MOVING IN WITH JOE.

22:52.570 --> 22:55.573
I-I HAVEN'T YET.

22:58.580 --> 23:00.571
- DO YOU THINK HE DOESN'T WANT
TO MOVE IN THERE?

23:00.620 --> 23:03.441
- I JUST THINK IT'S GONNA BE
DIFFERENT FOR HIM.

23:03.480 --> 23:07.064
IT'S A BIG CHANGE,
YOU KNOW?

23:07.100 --> 23:08.488
NOW IT'S ALL OFFICIAL.

23:08.520 --> 23:11.512
YOU KNOW?

23:12.970 --> 23:15.768
HE'S A GOOD GUY.

23:21.190 --> 23:24.944
- HE'S A LUCKY GUY.

23:24.980 --> 23:27.119
THAT'S FOR SURE.

23:27.160 --> 23:28.604
I'M GONNA
CHECK ON THE BOY.

24:06.300 --> 24:10.122
- THANKS.
SORRY IT'S MESSY RIGHT NOW.

24:10.170 --> 24:11.125
- IT'S OKAY.

24:11.170 --> 24:13.684
I TRIED TO CALL A LOT,

24:13.720 --> 24:16.280
AND I EMAILED YOU
A FEW TIMES.

24:16.310 --> 24:19.894
AMBER, I, UM--

24:19.940 --> 24:21.658
I'M REALLY SORRY

24:21.700 --> 24:23.793
FOR HOW EVERYTHING HAPPENED
IN SACRAMENTO.

24:23.840 --> 24:24.864
I REALLY AM.

24:24.910 --> 24:26.480
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO EM BARRASS YOU,

24:26.530 --> 24:28.839
AND I'M SORRY
THAT I MADE A SCENE,

24:28.880 --> 24:30.529
BUT I'M NOT SORRY
ABOUT WHY I DID IT.

24:30.570 --> 24:34.290
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU'RE OKAY.

24:34.330 --> 24:35.297
[sighs]

24:35.330 --> 24:38.015
- NO, I--

24:38.060 --> 24:43.669
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND.
TO BE HONEST, I--

24:43.720 --> 24:46.507
I GET WHY YOU DID
WHAT YOU DID.

24:46.550 --> 24:50.850
I JUST FEEL CONFUSED
ABOUT...

24:50.900 --> 24:52.549
WHAT TO DO
AND WHERE I--

24:52.590 --> 24:54.137
- I JUST DON'T WANT
TO SEE YOU GIVE UP.

24:54.180 --> 24:57.764
I WANT YOU
TO COME BACK TO WORK.

24:57.800 --> 24:58.767
- [sighs]

24:58.800 --> 25:00.244
- AMBER,
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,

25:00.290 --> 25:04.875
I MADE SOME REALLY
STUPID DECISIONS THAT I REGRET.

25:04.910 --> 25:08.255
I KNOW THAT I'M YOUR AUNT,
BUT I UNDERSTAND.

25:08.290 --> 25:11.225
I DO,

A LITTLE, BRAVERMAN!

26:08.220 --> 26:10.040
[laughter]

26:10.080 --> 26:11.217
- SHH!
WE'RE GONNA GET KICKED OUT

26:11.250 --> 26:13.115
OF THE CLASS CAMP TRIP.

26:13.150 --> 26:14.185

- ALL RIGHT, BUDDY,

26:14.220 --> 26:15.289
LET'S GET SOME SHUT-EYE.
- ALL RIGHT.

26:15.330 --> 26:16.592
- WHAT DO YOU SAY?

26:16.640 --> 26:17.629
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO
ON THE TRAIL.

26:17.670 --> 26:21.049
- AND IT IS TIME
FOR ME TO GO.

26:21.090 --> 26:23.081
- WHY DO YOU HAVE TO GO,
MOM?

26:23.130 --> 26:25.781
- HONEY, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.
YOU KNOW WHY I HAVE TO GO.

26:25.820 --> 26:27.299
- I KNOW
WE TALKED ABOUT IT,

26:27.340 --> 26:29.331
BUT I REALLY DON'T
UNDERSTAND IT.

26:29.380 --> 26:32.099

WE'RE TAKING ON WATER.
GET UP, GET UP, GET UP, GET UP.

38:21.020 --> 38:22.669
- OOH.
GET UP, GET UP, GET UP.

38:22.710 --> 38:23.870
- WATER?
- YEAH.

38:23.920 --> 38:25.319
GET UP, GET UP,
GET UP, GET UP.

38:25.370 --> 38:28.771
OH, MY GOD, IT'S POURING.
- WHAT?

38:28.820 --> 38:31.926
- IT'S POURING!
- GET UP, GET UP.

38:31.960 --> 38:34.121
- [laughs]
- OH!

38:34.170 --> 38:35.751
I THOUGHT IT WASN'T
SUPPOSED TO RAIN!

38:35.790 --> 38:36.859
- YEAH, WELL, IT'S--
- [screams]

38:36.900 --> 38:38.652
- PULL EVERYTHING UP.
- GET INSIDE. GET INSIDE.

38:38.690 --> 38:40.794
- YEAH.
I'LL TAKE DOWN THE STAKES.

38:40.830 --> 38:45.836
- THOSE PEOPLE
WERE OVERJOYED

38:45.870 --> 38:48.555
THEY TOOK
TO THEIR BOATS

38:48.600 --> 38:50.488
- HEY.
- HI.

38:50.530 --> 38:51.758
- SORRY,
I DIDN'T MEAN TO WAKE YOU UP.

38:51.810 --> 38:55.564
- IS EVERY'||_'||i|ING OKAY?

38:55.600 --> 38:58.114
- IS IT A BAD TIME?
- NO.

38:58.160 --> 38:59.559
WHAT'S GOING ON?

38:59.610 --> 39:01.817
- I THOUGHT IT
LESS LIKE A LAKE

39:01.850 --> 39:06.640
AND MORE LIKE A MOAT

39:12.000 --> 39:14.798
THE RHYTHM
OF MY FOOTSTEPS

39:14.830 --> 39:18.789
CROSSING FLATLANDS
TO YOUR DOOR

39:18.830 --> 39:21.628
HAVE BEEN SILENCED

39:21.660 --> 39:27.075
FOREVERMORE

39:27.120 --> 39:30.738
AND THE DISTANCE
IS QUITE SIMPLY

39:30.780 --> 39:34.705
MUCH TOO FAR
FOR ME TO ROW

39:34.750 --> 39:37.435
- [choked up]
I JUST DON'T--

39:37.470 --> 39:39.028
I JUST DON'T REALLY WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

39:39.060 --> 39:42.405
- OKAY.

39:44.790 --> 39:47.827
- I JUST WANTED
TO SEE MY MOM, YOU KNOW?

39:53.180 --> 39:58.698
[sighs]

39:58.740 --> 40:02.528
I MISSED YOU.

40:02.570 --> 40:04.595
- I MISSED YOU.

40:04.640 --> 40:06.676
MISSED YOU.

40:06.710 --> 40:07.699
- [sighs]

40:07.750 --> 40:13.529

40:15.170 --> 40:17.570
- WHOO!

40:17.620 --> 40:18.826
- BYE, DADDY.
THAT WAS SO MUCH FUN.

40:18.860 --> 40:19.758
- I LOVE YOU,
BUDDY.

40:19.790 --> 40:23.749
GET IN BEFORE YOUR UNDERWEAR
GETS WET.

40:23.800 --> 40:26.485
HEY, THANKS FOR COMING.

40:26.520 --> 40:27.657

40:27.700 --> 40:30.658
- OKAY,
AND, UM, YOU KNOW,

40:30.700 --> 40:32.622
JOE IS A REALLY GREAT GUY,

40:32.670 --> 40:34.763
AND YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY
ABOUT TELLING JABBAR.

40:34.810 --> 40:36.698
HE'S GONNA BE FINE.
- OKAY.

40:36.740 --> 40:37.707
- OKAY.

40:37.740 --> 40:42.495
- THANKS.
- YEAH. ALL RIGHT.

40:42.540 --> 40:43.746
[thunder booms]

40:43.780 --> 40:48.023
- [panting]

40:49.680 --> 40:51.648
OKAY.

40:59.760 --> 41:05.972
- I NEED YOU
SO MUCH CLOSER

41:07.110 --> 41:12.946
I NEED YOU
SO MUCH CLOSER

41:14.780 --> 41:17.749
I NEED YOU
SO MUCH CLOSER

41:17.780 --> 41:20.055
WAIT. STAY HERE.

41:20.090 --> 41:21.819
I FORGOT TO TELL
YOUR DAD SOMETHING.

41:21.850 --> 41:22.839
WAIT!

41:22.890 --> 41:26.951
- I NEED YOU
SO MUCH CLOSER

41:29.790 --> 41:31.098
- WHAT?
- I LOVE YOU.

41:31.140 --> 41:33.279
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED YOU.
I NEVER STOPPED LOVING YOU.

41:33.310 --> 41:35.961
AND--AND I DON'T WANT TO LIVE
WITH ANYBODY ELSE.

41:36.010 --> 41:38.069
AND I KNOW THAT WE ARGUE
ALL THE TIME, AND WE FIGHT.

41:38.110 --> 41:40.032
AND--AND I'M BOSSY
AND CONTROLLING AND YOU'RE--

41:40.080 --> 41:41.763
WELL, YOU'RE YOU,
BUT...

41:41.800 --> 41:44.689
[sighs]

41:44.740 --> 41:48.665
I LOVE OUR FAMILY,
AND I WANT TO BE WITH YOU.

41:48.710 --> 41:51.941
CROSBY BRAVERMAN,

41:51.990 --> 41:54.322
I WANT TO BE
YOUR WIFE.

41:54.370 --> 41:57.123
WILL YOU STILL
MARRY ME?

41:57.160 --> 41:58.809
- YES, I WILL MARRY YOU.

41:58.860 --> 41:59.815
- YOU WILL?

41:59.860 --> 42:03.205
