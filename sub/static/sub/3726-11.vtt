WEBVTT

00:01.860 --> 00:05.227
(female narrator)
For six seasons,
the mysterious A has hunted

00:05.330 --> 00:08.538
haunted, and taunted
the pretty little liars.

00:08.640 --> 00:10.130
"I'm still here, bitches."

00:10.240 --> 00:12.572
(all)
"And I know everything. A."

00:12.680 --> 00:15.001
After years of living
in terror..

00:15.110 --> 00:16.008
Somebody help me!

00:16.110 --> 00:17.077
...they finally discover

00:17.180 --> 00:18.147
the true identity

00:18.250 --> 00:20.138
of their tormentor.

00:20.250 --> 00:22.741
Cece Drake was A.

00:22.850 --> 00:24.545
Game over.

00:24.650 --> 00:27.517
The liars have moved on
and started new lives.

00:27.620 --> 00:29.520
(Troian)
I mean, a lot has happened,
good, bad, and ugly.

00:29.630 --> 00:32.019
(female narrator)
But after five years of peace

00:32.130 --> 00:33.119
the pretty little liars

00:33.230 --> 00:34.219
must return to Rosewood

00:34.330 --> 00:36.719
and face a new more
Sinister threat.

00:36.830 --> 00:38.161
He's coming for you.

00:38.270 --> 00:40.192
We came back here for you, Ali.
So move it!

00:40.300 --> 00:41.631
* Calling my name

00:41.740 --> 00:43.367
* Is a twisted game

00:43.470 --> 00:45.802
In this special episode,
you'll learn the secrets

00:45.910 --> 00:49.107
of the new season direct
from the creator and writers

00:49.210 --> 00:50.507
of "Pretty Little Liars."

00:50.610 --> 00:53.374
I think Emily comes back
with the bigger secret.

00:53.480 --> 00:55.311
The cast reveals
what has changed.

00:55.420 --> 00:57.149
He inherits a grip of money.

00:57.250 --> 00:59.753
While she was in Europe,
she met her fiance.

00:59.860 --> 01:02.181
* I want you to give me

01:02.290 --> 01:04.485
* All of you

01:04.590 --> 01:06.296
Plus, you'll go
behind the scenes

01:06.400 --> 01:08.391
to reveal the liars'
all new looks.

01:08.500 --> 01:11.389
I decided to do the opposite of
what they were in high school.

01:11.500 --> 01:14.196
Discover some of Rosewood's
biggest changes.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.307
(female narrator)
Find out how the moms think

01:18.410 --> 01:20.571
they escape
from that locked basement .

01:20.680 --> 01:21.669
[all gasping]

01:21.780 --> 01:23.441
And experience two exclusive

01:23.550 --> 01:26.348
never-before-seen
"Pretty Little Liars" moments.

01:26.450 --> 01:27.610
All right here on

01:27.720 --> 01:28.744
"Pretty Little Liars.

01:28.850 --> 01:31.341
Five Years Forward."

01:35.190 --> 01:36.350
Hi, I'm Marlene King.

01:36.460 --> 01:38.087
I'm the_ creator
and executive producer

01:38.190 --> 01:39.350
of "Pretty Little Liars."

01:39.460 --> 01:41.291
And I'm sitting here
in Spencer's barn

01:41.400 --> 01:45.291
which is really the place where
our story started six years ago.

01:45.400 --> 01:48.392
And I'm with
the amazing pretty little liars.

01:48.500 --> 01:52.504
When we made this time jump,
we literally wrapped one episode

01:52.610 --> 01:55.704
one day, made the time jump
the very next day.

01:55.810 --> 01:58.404
I think that actually, like,
was the biggest challenge.

01:58.510 --> 02:01.115
It's like we knew
what was coming up.

02:01.220 --> 02:03.484
So we, I think
we're all very excited.

02:03.590 --> 02:05.581
I mean, when we got the news,
we were all so excited.

02:05.690 --> 02:08.284
Up until this point, like,
we've been with the story.

02:08.390 --> 02:09.687
When you-you write something,
it's like, "Oh, yes."

02:09.790 --> 02:12.258
This is, we're kind of acting
it out real time.

02:12.360 --> 02:14.658
And now with this jump, we have
this sort of thing, like

02:14.760 --> 02:17.866
filling in all we have
not experienced

02:17.970 --> 02:19.892
with somebody, and this is
what sort of very strange

02:20.000 --> 02:21.490
about all the situation
is that

02:21.600 --> 02:23.807
is that we have known these
characters for so long

02:23.910 --> 02:27.129
and then now it's, like,
oh, we sort of catch up again.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.299
Um, you know,
reintroduced to something

02:29.410 --> 02:31.674
we've kind of helped to craft.

02:31.780 --> 02:33.418
Our wardrobe was very different.

02:33.520 --> 02:35.476
We got to change our hair,
which, you know

02:35.580 --> 02:37.514
when you change, when you
physically change yourself

02:37.620 --> 02:41.283
it sort of helps you to fit into
the character a little bit more.

02:41.390 --> 02:42.550
'Cause you're ultimately
still who you were.

02:42.660 --> 02:44.548
You're just a little older
and wiser and..

02:44.660 --> 02:46.821
(Oliver)
What are some thoughts
you might have

02:46.930 --> 02:49.694
about this upcoming season
jumping five years?

02:49.800 --> 02:53.338
Well, it's-it's great to be able
to see Aria as a grown-up

02:53.440 --> 02:56.603
and how our whole family dynamic
changes a bit.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.803
And then, of course,
everyone wants to know

02:58.910 --> 03:00.537
does she actually end up
with Ezra

03:00.640 --> 03:03.347
which I really
wanna know myself.

03:03.450 --> 03:04.769
I think Hanna's gonna
have a lot figured out.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.916
And she's gonna look like
she's got it all together.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.784
But I think she's still prone to
making some of the same mistakes

03:09.890 --> 03:13.883
and, and, uh, you know, Ashley
is gonna need to figure out

03:13.990 --> 03:15.548
how much_ advice
she can give her

03:15.660 --> 03:18.185
and how much Hanna's gonna be
willing to take.

03:18.290 --> 03:19.894
(Marlene)
'50, Ash, what can
you tell us about'

03:20.000 --> 03:22.594
'what Hanna's been doing
for the last five years?‘

03:22.700 --> 03:25.828
In the prom episode, Caleb talks
about going to New York.

03:25.930 --> 03:27.739
Who's moving to New York?

03:27.840 --> 03:29.467
We are.

03:29.570 --> 03:31.333
If that's still your dream.

03:32.540 --> 03:33.905
Yes, we move to New York.

03:34.010 --> 03:35.204
Caleb did not go to college

03:35.310 --> 03:36.800
'cause he doesn't need to.

03:36.910 --> 03:37.899
He's that smart.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.079
They moved to New York together

03:39.180 --> 03:42.479
and he continued his journey on,
like, in the tech world.

03:42.590 --> 03:45.912
I'm officially
an information risk analyst.

03:46.020 --> 03:46.952
What's that?

03:47.060 --> 03:48.413
I keep the hackers out.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.624
Meanwhile, Hanna was going
to school for fashion.

03:50.730 --> 03:54.291
She goes to college
for fashion at F.I.T.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.766
And they live in Tribeca.

03:56.870 --> 03:59.737
And, uh, this is like
so what I would wanna do

03:59.840 --> 04:00.795
like, in my real life.

04:01.700 --> 04:02.462
Um, so I'm really excited
about that.

04:03.410 --> 04:03.933
We got to see your apartment
in New York.

04:04.640 --> 04:05.368
- Yes.
- 'Tell us about that.‘

04:06.070 --> 04:07.628
That was a tiny, tiny apartment.

04:07.740 --> 04:08.809
It was a shoebox.

04:08.910 --> 04:10.901
It probably costs $3000 a month.

04:11.010 --> 04:12.773
Uh, that's-that's
how New York is.

04:12.880 --> 04:14.017
Um, but it was cool.

04:14.120 --> 04:15.246
It was actually like a good mix

04:15.350 --> 04:16.715
of, like, Caleb and Hanna style.

04:16.820 --> 04:20.256
I mean, she kinda took over
the-the decoration mostly, but..

04:20.360 --> 04:22.521
- Wall that you could decorate..
- Yeah.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.382
I think I there was just like
a computer in there

04:24.490 --> 04:25.980
and that was all I got,
but still..

04:26.090 --> 04:27.523
But, yeah, she just
studied fashion

04:27.630 --> 04:29.769
she became an intern
for Zac Posen.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.019
She went to Europe

04:31.130 --> 04:35.396
um, and worked for him
and met her current boss

04:35.500 --> 04:39.266
Claudia Greco, who's like
the Anna Wintour of fashion.

04:39.380 --> 04:40.699
Um, and she becomes
her assistant.

04:40.810 --> 04:43.938
It was interesting to go from,
you know, the end of 6A

04:44.050 --> 04:45.802
and we're at the prom

04:45.910 --> 04:47.810
and it's like this little bit
romantic moment

04:47.920 --> 04:49.808
and then when
we come back in 63

04:49.920 --> 04:52.957
Hanna and Caleb are not
in the same exact place.

04:54.060 --> 04:54.981
Things really didn't quite

04:55.090 --> 04:56.455
work out with her and Caleb.

04:56.560 --> 04:57.754
She was always gone.

04:57.860 --> 04:59.555
A lot of travelling,
and she didn't

04:59.660 --> 05:01.628
really make time for her
relationship with him.

05:01.730 --> 05:03.493
It was strange a little bit.

05:03.600 --> 05:06.569
Jump from super romantic
to having anxiety

05:06.670 --> 05:08.558
just to see this girl
who's been

05:08.670 --> 05:10.331
my girlfriend for six years,
you know whatI mean.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.431
But, yeah, she comes back
and she's engaged.

05:12.540 --> 05:14.405
Let me see this?

05:14.510 --> 05:15.670
It looked bigger
when you posted it.

05:15.780 --> 05:20.410
While she was in Europe,
she met her fiance.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.010
That was like the saddest part
I've ever had

05:22.120 --> 05:23.815
that I was away from Caleb.

05:23.920 --> 05:27.879
Spencer went off to Georgetown,
and I think really finally got

05:27.990 --> 05:32.086
to actually focus on academics,
uhm, for like the first time

05:32.190 --> 05:35.751
'cause she was always dealing
with, like, A and that mystery

05:35.860 --> 05:38.567
and all this kind of,
like, issuing her homework

05:38.670 --> 05:39.830
to be in the woods.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.589
You know,
it's kind of snooping around.

05:41.700 --> 05:44.567
Spencer and I just...went
out of sync.

05:44.670 --> 05:47.730
She and Toby really fell apart
'cause he was staying

05:47.840 --> 05:49.569
in Rosewood, he was still
on the police force.

05:49.680 --> 05:51.079
Every chance that he can,
he can go

05:51.180 --> 05:53.671
he visits her, but, you know,
he still has his life back

05:53.780 --> 05:55.668
in Rosewood,
he's still a police ofﬁcer.

05:55.780 --> 05:57.748
And they just really grew apart.

05:57.850 --> 05:59.989
She was finally getting to do
something that she wanted to do

06:00.090 --> 06:03.457
and be in a major city
and be involved in politics

06:03.560 --> 06:04.879
and her career, and I think

06:04.990 --> 06:07.857
he was still very, very much
involved in a small town.

06:07.960 --> 06:10.997
(Keegan)
I like this town,
but everywhere she went

06:11.100 --> 06:13.432
it was, like, she saw something
that she wanted to forget.

06:13.540 --> 06:16.759
You've got to take a romance
that's been working

06:16.870 --> 06:20.909
for six years and kind of watch
the moment when it all crumbles.

06:21.010 --> 06:23.001
Now she's graduated Georgetown

06:23.110 --> 06:25.044
and she's working
on Capitol Hill.

06:25.150 --> 06:27.778
- You work for a lobbyist.
- No! We're not lobbyist.

06:27.880 --> 06:29.882
We work with grassroots
political organizations

06:29.990 --> 06:31.582
to advance progressive
legislation.

06:31.690 --> 06:32.952
You're a lobbyist.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.711
I don't think she's probably
a glorified coffee gopher

06:35.820 --> 06:37.879
uh, but she has high
political aspirations.

06:37.990 --> 06:41.721
He inherits a grip of money.
And I say a lot of money.

06:41.830 --> 06:44.390
Um, from.. We finally
find out from the house

06:44.500 --> 06:45.865
that was blown up.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.667
[all screaming]

06:50.910 --> 06:52.798
- He finally.. By A.
- By A. By A.

06:52.910 --> 06:54.798
He inherits all this money
and he buys three acres

06:54.910 --> 06:58.744
outside of Rosewood to, uh,
start building his dream home.

06:58.850 --> 07:00.670
And, uh, you know,
he's working on the force

07:00.780 --> 07:04.546
and he, by accident walks
into in a robbery.

07:04.650 --> 07:07.619
And he apprehends the suspect

07:07.720 --> 07:09.984
turns out the person
that he saves

07:10.090 --> 07:12.593
uh, is this girl
named Yvonne Phillips

07:12.700 --> 07:14.622
uh, who ends up being
a very important person

07:14.730 --> 07:16.459
uh, in the story
and in his life.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.162
Who do you think
has changed the most

07:18.270 --> 07:20.431
during our five-year time jump?

07:20.540 --> 07:23.464
I know that the easy one is
to say Ezra's changed the most

07:23.570 --> 07:25.060
but I feel like..

07:25.170 --> 07:27.707
I know, I know it's..
but here's the thing..

07:29.110 --> 07:31.101
You know, you're a writer,
so you never know, like

07:31.210 --> 07:34.646
you're-you're into this, like,
world of darkness.

07:34.750 --> 07:36.843
Yeah, my life's meaning,
all that stuff..

07:36.950 --> 07:40.989
I think Ca-Caleb has-has changed
the most because it's, like we..

07:41.090 --> 07:42.955
I mean, all over the
whole course of the show

07:43.060 --> 07:45.528
I mean, we come to somebody
who's, who's really

07:45.630 --> 07:47.518
you know, come up
from a really bad situation

07:47.630 --> 07:49.996
and got into this amazing kind
of lifestyle.

07:50.100 --> 07:53.092
And then our characters
over this time jump

07:53.200 --> 07:54.633
we go fishing every..

07:54.740 --> 07:56.799
We go fishing.
We're, like, best, best friends.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.866
Yeah, we had a real bromance.

07:58.970 --> 08:00.733
- Like best friends.
- 'Yeah.‘

08:02.280 --> 08:03.872
Wow, you're bringing
that flip-flops, Em?

08:03.980 --> 08:05.641
It's Malibu.

08:05.750 --> 08:06.671
(Shay)
I think for Emily it was about

08:06.780 --> 08:08.077
going as far as she could.

08:08.180 --> 08:10.614
Kind of an, I think California
to her has always

08:10.720 --> 08:12.483
held a special place
in her heart.

08:12.590 --> 08:13.955
So she moves to the west coast

08:14.060 --> 08:16.585
and she goes
to school there for a bit.

08:16.690 --> 08:19.124
And then she drops out
because after finding out

08:19.230 --> 08:21.619
that her father passed away
in the army

08:21.730 --> 08:23.095
it was too much for her.

08:23.200 --> 08:24.497
(Emily)
When my dad died, I just

08:24.600 --> 08:26.192
couldn't see a point to it.

08:26.300 --> 08:28.768
- To college?
- Anything.

08:28.870 --> 08:30.963
(Shay)
As much as as it was tough
with her father passing

08:31.070 --> 08:34.039
I think it was good
for Emily to be in California

08:34.140 --> 08:36.779
so she starts bartending
in California.

08:36.880 --> 08:39.769
But in the school and then
her mom being back in Rosewood.

08:39.880 --> 08:42.041
It was like a happy-sad thing to
have to come back to Rosewood.

08:42.150 --> 08:44.983
I think Emily comes back
with the bigger secret.

08:45.090 --> 08:49.083
Uh, I think that-that
you three create secrets

08:49.190 --> 08:51.658
n our first episode,
back really

08:51.760 --> 08:54.797
but Emily comes back with the
secret which we won't spoil

08:54.900 --> 08:57.767
that she is keeping
from her friends and..

08:57.870 --> 09:00.134
'Yeah, I think Emily comes back
with the biggest baggage too.'

09:00.240 --> 09:01.696
I think she is the most damaged

09:01.800 --> 09:05.031
by, four years without,
without A.

09:05.140 --> 09:06.061
Yeah.

09:06.170 --> 09:07.603
Coming up, our first new

09:07.710 --> 09:09.007
"Pretty Little Liars" moment

09:09.110 --> 09:11.146
that you haven't seen
anywhere else.

09:11.250 --> 09:12.615
Time for you to see your sister.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.574
And later, the cast details

09:14.680 --> 09:16.147
an all new threat to Rosewood.

09:16.250 --> 09:20.209
Paranoia, blackmail,
it's a life-threating situation.

09:20.320 --> 09:24.154
When "Pretty Little Liars,
Five Years Forward" continues.

09:25.730 --> 09:28.654
Cece...please don't do this.

09:30.970 --> 09:32.164
[gaSPSI

09:32.270 --> 09:33.294
Darcy tweeted

09:33.400 --> 09:35.937
"Of course Spencer can defuse
a bomb."

09:36.040 --> 09:36.961
Dammit.

09:38.840 --> 09:39.932
* It's a perfect day for.. *

09:40.040 --> 09:41.837
Andthentherewasone tweeted

09:41.940 --> 09:44.841
"Emily didn't have a Plan B
after swimming, huh?

09:44.950 --> 09:48.716
And Lauren tweeted, "Emily is
going to Pepperdine in Malibu"

09:48.820 --> 09:50.242
which is in California.

09:50.350 --> 09:53.057
Where is Paige?
In California.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.957
A mark.

09:55.060 --> 09:57.722
You're about to see something
no one else has seen.

09:57.830 --> 09:59.058
Footage of an event
that happened

09:59.160 --> 10:01.856
in Rosewood, Pennsylvania
after the last time

10:01.960 --> 10:03.689
you saw the
"Pretty Little Liars"

10:03.800 --> 10:05.324
and before
you'll see them again.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.864
A lot can happen in five years.

10:09.070 --> 10:11.129
[instrumental music]

10:17.880 --> 10:19.745
For more than a decade,
Charlotte has been told

10:19.850 --> 10:21.044
she was a bad person.

10:21.150 --> 10:22.242
I mean, if that's all
a person hears

10:22.350 --> 10:23.817
she begins to believe it.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.080
It's gonna take years
to reverse

10:25.190 --> 10:26.748
that kind of damage.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.919
How could my dad have
done this to her?

10:29.020 --> 10:30.180
'Your father has to live
with himself.‘

10:30.290 --> 10:31.985
'That's his punishment.‘

10:32.090 --> 10:34.888
It's time for you
to see your sister.

10:43.910 --> 10:45.935
[instrumental music]

11:05.090 --> 11:07.820
Do you think
Alison has forgiven Charlotte

11:07.930 --> 11:10.763
for all the torture?

11:10.870 --> 11:11.825
I think she's trying.

11:11.930 --> 11:13.295
I think there's a few things

11:13.400 --> 11:16.369
that are harder than others.

11:16.470 --> 11:18.734
It feels like
Alison and Charlotte

11:18.840 --> 11:20.933
are probably healing together.

11:21.040 --> 11:23.873
It's really neat to see, um..

11:23.980 --> 11:28.019
...Alison, um, in a new light
really connecting with Charlotte

11:28.120 --> 11:29.940
and trusting her
and working with her

11:30.050 --> 11:31.813
you know, through these years.

11:31.920 --> 11:35.117
But also Charlotte, uh,
has this great doctor.

11:35.220 --> 11:36.949
- 'Yes, she does.‘
- She does.

11:37.060 --> 11:38.948
And you end up meeting him.

11:39.060 --> 11:40.027
Dr. Rollins.

11:40.900 --> 11:42.219
I think it's really fun
for the fans

11:42.330 --> 11:44.298
to _see this
new relationship bloom

11:44.400 --> 11:47.233
_because a_lot _
of Alison's relationships

11:47.340 --> 11:51.060
have been interesting and kind
of dysfunctional a little bit

11:51.170 --> 11:52.933
and he just,
he treats her really well.

11:53.040 --> 11:54.803
It needs to be a little bit
more of a secret

11:54.910 --> 11:56.775
because of the nature
of their relationship

11:56.880 --> 11:58.848
because he is a doctor.

11:58.950 --> 12:01.077
So I think that's also kind
of how easy it is for Alison

12:01.180 --> 12:02.841
to kind of slip into

12:02.950 --> 12:05.339
you know,
the same old secrets and lies.

12:05.450 --> 12:07.179
(Marlene)
'Lucy, can you tell us,
like, a little bit'

12:07.290 --> 12:09.952
about what Aria has been doing
since we last saw her.

12:10.060 --> 12:11.425
You know, in the five years,
I think she's in a good spot.

12:11.530 --> 12:14.829
She's in a new relationship,
she's fallen in love again.

12:14.930 --> 12:16.227
Um, you know, I wanna believe
that she really

12:16.330 --> 12:18.059
loves this guy Liam,
who she works with.

12:18.170 --> 12:21.139
And she goes to Georgia,
and then, um,

12:21.240 --> 12:22.389
for a while, you know

12:23.540 --> 12:24.837
if you keep up with Aria,
you know, she's very creative.

12:25.910 --> 12:25.932
And she has always
loved photography.

12:26.640 --> 12:27.834
So she's majoring in photography

12:27.940 --> 12:29.407
finds a love of writing

12:29.510 --> 12:30.772
um, transfers to Boston--

12:30.880 --> 12:32.279
Which was her original love.

12:32.380 --> 12:33.972
She has always loved reading.
She has always loved writing.

12:34.080 --> 12:36.241
I think that's why her and Ezra
had such a, you know

12:36.350 --> 12:38.147
obviously they're very attracted
to each other

12:38.250 --> 12:41.287
but they had an intellectual,
um, attraction as well.

12:41.390 --> 12:43.153
So, anyway, she goes to Boston

12:43.260 --> 12:45.421
um, changes her major
to writing

12:45.530 --> 12:46.758
uh, finds a love
of publishing.

12:46.860 --> 12:50.296
And so when we catch up with
her, she works for a publisher.

12:50.400 --> 12:53.062
And that sort of, in a
time jump, how her and Ezra

12:53.170 --> 12:56.196
get reconnected is more,
not in a romantic way

12:56.300 --> 12:59.201
but they actually start
working together.

12:59.940 --> 13:01.271
[screaming]

13:01.380 --> 13:04.941
I think Aria is in denial
about a lot of things.

13:05.050 --> 13:08.770
Maybe still in, you know, denial
that she's fully over this.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.317
I think if this happens
to someone

13:12.420 --> 13:13.978
the-the things that these girls
have been through

13:14.090 --> 13:15.955
I don't think _
you ever get over it.

13:16.060 --> 13:18.551
Ever. I mean, you can pretend,
you can get a new job

13:18.660 --> 13:20.298
a new boyfriend,
new friends, whatever.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.288
Move to a different city,
but I think that

13:22.400 --> 13:23.469
it becomes who you are.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.162
I think that those years

13:25.270 --> 13:26.225
molded who they are.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.394
And I think, yeah,
it's horrible, it's terrible

13:29.440 --> 13:31.067
but I think these
are four very strong girls.

13:31.170 --> 13:33.536
And I think that what happened
gave them strength

13:33.640 --> 13:35.335
that a lot of people their age
probably don't have.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.307
- Take off your mask. Now!
- Take it off!

13:38.410 --> 13:41.049
Aria probably hides
behind her work a little bit.

13:41.150 --> 13:42.310
Hides behind a relationship.

13:42.420 --> 13:44.081
If you look,
Aria has dated lot of guys.

13:44.190 --> 13:45.339
She has never been by herself.

13:45.450 --> 13:46.883
I think that says something

13:46.990 --> 13:47.911
maybe a little.

13:48.020 --> 13:49.487
She, you know, finds comfort

13:49.590 --> 13:50.989
in being with someone.

13:51.090 --> 13:52.421
And I think it will always
haunt her.

13:52.530 --> 13:53.952
I-I think so.

13:54.600 --> 13:57.091
Ezra. .

13:57.200 --> 13:59.395
...I don't want you
to come with me to LA.

14:00.300 --> 14:01.938
What?

14:02.040 --> 14:05.305
When I go there to somewhere
for my internship..

14:06.610 --> 14:08.271
I need to go alone.

14:08.380 --> 14:10.974
Last we saw Ez-ria

14:11.080 --> 14:13.116
'uh, you guys were also
at the prom.‘

14:13.220 --> 14:14.471
'Uh, and you were talking about'

14:14.580 --> 14:16.514
sort of going
your separate ways.

14:16.620 --> 14:17.609
They were really good friends.

14:17.720 --> 14:19.142
You know, I think that they knew

14:19.250 --> 14:23.220
that they needed to go
and experience...life

14:23.330 --> 14:25.389
and that meant
sort of being apart.

14:26.660 --> 14:28.855
Yeah.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.996
Change could be good
for both of us.

14:31.970 --> 14:33.289
Yeah.

14:34.340 --> 14:36.399
Ezra has had an eventful
five years.

14:36.500 --> 14:40.209
Like most people hopefully
don't experience what he has.

14:40.310 --> 14:42.403
I think coming back
after the time jump

14:42.510 --> 14:45.377
'Ezra comes back with the most
emotional baggage'

14:45.480 --> 14:47.948
and is the most damaged
by the incidents

14:48.050 --> 14:49.119
of the last five years.

14:49.220 --> 14:52.018
So basically
he has found a love.

14:52.120 --> 14:55.317
Ezra has followed,
um, the character Nicole

14:55.420 --> 14:58.218
down to, uh,
South America to sort of view

14:58.330 --> 15:00.548
Habitat for Humanity
and other sort of

15:00.660 --> 15:02.525
service saving the world
type things.

15:02.630 --> 15:04.427
This is sort of his dreams.
This is his callings.

15:04.530 --> 15:06.122
This is what he wants to do.

15:06.230 --> 15:08.960
Um, and that is sort of..

15:09.070 --> 15:10.162
...taken away from him

15:10.270 --> 15:12.659
very, uh, quickly and

15:12.770 --> 15:15.307
um-m-m-m, violently.

15:15.410 --> 15:17.401
So he comes back to Rosewood,
back to this place where he..

15:17.510 --> 15:19.501
I think, he really,
in his mind, is like

15:19.610 --> 15:21.373
I'm not coming back here.

15:21.480 --> 15:24.643
Now, he's back and just
completely rudderless.

15:24.750 --> 15:28.015
Completely has no sense
of who he is

15:28.120 --> 15:29.553
and what he is supposed
to do with his life.

15:29.660 --> 15:34.029
And, uh, he falls down
a really deep well, uh

15:34.130 --> 15:36.598
into, uh, a sea of alcohol

15:36.700 --> 15:38.588
if we continue on this metaphor.

15:38.700 --> 15:41.498
This is a really
dark, emotional place

15:41.600 --> 15:42.999
that we find him
and broken.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.031
- He's broken.
- Yeah.

15:44.140 --> 15:45.164
In several episodes

15:45.270 --> 15:46.237
I have like bruised knuckles

15:46.340 --> 15:48.228
and it's all sort of things that

15:48.340 --> 15:50.945
are very, like, new to Ezra.

15:51.050 --> 15:52.472
So, it's-it's really a lot
of fun to play.

15:52.580 --> 15:54.070
(female narrator)
When "Pretty Little Liars

15:54.180 --> 15:55.716
Five Years Forward" continues.

15:55.820 --> 15:58.516
The cast reveals what brought
them back to Rosewood

15:58.620 --> 16:00.110
after five years away.

16:00.220 --> 16:01.687
All of you in one place
at one time.

16:01.790 --> 16:03.519
When's the last time
that happened in Rosewood?

16:03.630 --> 16:04.949
(female narrator)
And the crew gives a new look

16:05.060 --> 16:07.096
to some old familiar places.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.225
The Radley Sanitarium
is now a hotel.

16:09.330 --> 16:10.297
Seriously, you would never know

16:10.400 --> 16:11.594
that this used to be
a nut house.

16:11.700 --> 16:13.338
(female narrator)
When we return.

16:19.110 --> 16:21.101
While Katie noted,
"Guess in Rosewood

16:21.210 --> 16:22.507
you need to be ready
for anything."

16:22.610 --> 16:24.009
[grunts]

16:25.780 --> 16:27.247
Danica tweeted, "Well, at least

16:27.350 --> 16:29.409
we don't have to wait
for 5 years."

16:29.520 --> 16:30.487
[chuckles]

16:30.590 --> 16:32.649
A camera mark.

16:32.750 --> 16:35.150
Oh, ah. I did it, guys.

16:38.490 --> 16:42.699
I will bring you home,
Charlotte. I promise.

16:42.800 --> 16:45.121
(Sasha)
Charlotte has been
getting better

16:45.230 --> 16:47.198
She's remarkably changed
and I think

16:47.300 --> 16:49.734
her mindset is totally different
and 1-1 think she is

16:49.840 --> 16:52.138
remorseful for what
has happened..

16:52.240 --> 16:54.708
I thought I'd let you
know in person.

16:54.810 --> 16:56.277
The judge set a date
for the hearing?

16:56.380 --> 16:58.268
- Yes.
- Oh, thank you.

16:58.380 --> 17:00.541
(Troian)
Alison reaches out and asks for

17:00.650 --> 17:02.447
her best friends
to come back

17:02.550 --> 17:05.087
and really help her to
establish a family again.

17:05.190 --> 17:08.114
At the hearing tomorrow
the judge will decide

17:08.220 --> 17:10.188
if she should be released.

17:10.290 --> 17:13.453
'And they want to hear
from people who were involved.‘

17:13.560 --> 17:15.619
- Victim statements.
- Statements of support.

17:15.730 --> 17:19.166
Statements that...she isn't
a threat to anybody.

17:19.270 --> 17:21.431
That you guys are not afraid
of her anymore.

17:22.570 --> 17:24.731
The girls, I think,
don't wanna do it.

17:24.840 --> 17:27.070
They.. But they feel an
allegiance to their friend

17:28.510 --> 17:30.444
and so they kind
of come back to this

17:30.550 --> 17:32.347
place that they all
chose to leave..

17:32.450 --> 17:35.248
All of you in one place
at one time.

17:35.350 --> 17:37.443
When's the last time
that happened in Rosewood?

17:38.720 --> 17:40.085
Long time.

17:40.190 --> 17:41.487
When you jump five years ahead

17:41.590 --> 17:44.718
this is a great impact
on the design of the show.

17:44.830 --> 17:46.718
And you three are very important

17:46.830 --> 17:48.627
obviously, to the design
of the show.

17:48.730 --> 17:50.288
What informed the changes

17:50.400 --> 17:52.061
you made in this five-year jump?

17:52.170 --> 17:53.569
What was the process
of coming up

17:53.670 --> 17:56.195
with a new look
for each of the PLLs?

17:56.300 --> 17:58.200
The jump was, gosh,
what a great opportunity

17:58.310 --> 18:00.676
to make some changes
from going from teenager

18:00.780 --> 18:02.372
to adult looks with the actors.

18:03.680 --> 18:04.374
But it's never something
that I come up with alone

18:05.750 --> 18:06.500
it's always a team effort,
which I love about the show.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.078
So, Cameron, tell us
how this big five-year leap

18:09.180 --> 18:10.340
has impacted costumes?

18:10.450 --> 18:12.088
So, I came on at the leap.

18:12.190 --> 18:14.658
So, which was a really good time
to have a new costume designer.

18:14.760 --> 18:18.184
And I started by watching a lot
of "Pretty Little Liars."

18:18.290 --> 18:19.723
Because, you know,
their old looks

18:19.830 --> 18:20.751
do inform their new looks

18:20.860 --> 18:22.088
so there's certainly a huge

18:22.200 --> 18:23.167
change with all the girls

18:23.270 --> 18:25.488
but we'll still see essence

18:25.600 --> 18:27.636
of their high school
selves, for sure.

18:27.740 --> 18:30.436
Like, Cindy was saying Shay
had moved to California

18:30.540 --> 18:31.632
so there's definitely
a beachier vibe

18:31.740 --> 18:33.207
with her this season.

18:33.310 --> 18:34.504
And Aria, she's always been

18:34.610 --> 18:36.407
so colorful and mixing patterns

18:36.510 --> 18:37.477
that, I don't think that would

18:37.580 --> 18:39.104
magically go away in five years

18:39.210 --> 18:40.711
so we've kept on doing that.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.776
For me, it was a lot of, uh..

18:42.880 --> 18:44.814
Are they gonna have short hair,
long hair, different colors?

18:44.920 --> 18:46.239
They like changing it.

18:46.350 --> 18:48.181
The girls like
being different a lot

18:48.290 --> 18:49.382
I've found over the years.

18:49.490 --> 18:50.821
I definitely,
I think, wanted to see

18:50.930 --> 18:53.194
a more adult version of them.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.255
Because they've been
in high school

18:54.360 --> 18:56.828
for...six years now maybe.

18:56.930 --> 18:58.227
I don't know.
It's a long time.

18:58.330 --> 18:59.524
Fourteen actually,
but who's counting.

18:59.630 --> 19:00.699
Who's counting?

19:00.800 --> 19:02.563
For me the jump was, um..

19:02.670 --> 19:04.501
It had a lot to do
with their wardrobe

19:04.610 --> 19:07.135
and with their _career choices
in life.

19:07.240 --> 19:09.800
I decided to change
everyone's looks.

19:09.910 --> 19:12.276
Like do the opposite of what
they were in high school.

19:12.380 --> 19:14.769
So, uh, for Ashley
and for, uh, Lucy

19:14.880 --> 19:17.815
I made them with less makeup,
more sophisticated.

19:17.920 --> 19:19.615
For Shay, I made her
little bit darker.

19:19.720 --> 19:21.813
She's from California
at this point

19:21.920 --> 19:23.421
and so she has that

19:23.530 --> 19:26.351
west coast look
and for Tr0ian

19:26.460 --> 19:28.223
I chose little bit more
sophisticated

19:28.330 --> 19:29.752
and more of a classic look.

19:29.860 --> 19:32.363
You'll see the difference
d-definitely in every character.

19:32.470 --> 19:34.358
Every character
has a little bit of a change

19:34.470 --> 19:35.698
and a little bit of their mark.

19:35.800 --> 19:38.564
Has this five-year jump
affected the actors?

19:38.670 --> 19:41.377
Well, I think that they are
really happy playing

19:41.480 --> 19:43.505
the age that's closest
to who they are.

19:43.610 --> 19:45.749
I think they're happy with the
clothes that they're wearing

19:45.850 --> 19:48.546
and they feel comfortable
with the-the

19:48.650 --> 19:50.447
the makeup and the hair
that we've chosen

19:50.550 --> 19:52.279
for them
on this five-year jump.

19:52.390 --> 19:53.857
This is something that I think
they've been waiting for.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.450
- 50.. And they're excited.
- They're looking forward to..

19:55.560 --> 19:57.187
They're excited about
this whole entire jump.

19:57.290 --> 19:58.257
- 'We're all excited.‘
- Yeah.

19:58.360 --> 20:00.726
What was the
PLL's reactions, uh,

20:00.830 --> 20:01.956
the girls, when they saw

20:02.060 --> 20:04.620
what you had in mind
and what was their input?

20:04.730 --> 20:07.460
I mean, what did they.. what did
they offer and what do they say

20:07.570 --> 20:08.662
was important to them
when they were

20:08.770 --> 20:10.431
talking about this
five-year leap?

20:10.540 --> 20:12.462
Troian probably had
a little bit more of an opinion

20:12.570 --> 20:15.437
because we thought that her
character would go a little bit

20:15.540 --> 20:17.701
like more on
a casual weekend look

20:17.810 --> 20:21.246
but she is staying basically
more on a business side.

20:21.350 --> 20:24.217
And, um, so I thought that I'd
be able to give her little bit

20:24.320 --> 20:25.719
more of what her personality
truly is.

20:25.820 --> 20:28.288
She's more,
you know, smolq eyes.

20:28.390 --> 20:30.585
I thought I'd give her the most,
to tell you the truth.

20:30.690 --> 20:32.851
Just because for.. during
the years in high school

20:32.960 --> 20:34.291
she wore the least of makeup.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.753
I think the biggest note I got

20:35.860 --> 20:37.464
from all the girls was like

20:37.570 --> 20:38.889
less jewelry,
smaller jewelry.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.696
That's what they really wanted.
Smaller accessories.

20:41.800 --> 20:42.937
Why is that?

20:43.040 --> 20:44.405
Probably like,
big earrings hurt.

20:44.510 --> 20:45.863
You know? Probably..
I don't know.

20:45.970 --> 20:47.631
I think they were just..
Yeah, I just think they were..

20:47.740 --> 20:50.277
After six year, like touching
your shoulder. It's like.

20:50.380 --> 20:52.598
Oh, that's not my hair.
It's my ear lobe.

20:52.710 --> 20:55.611
[intense music]

20:57.790 --> 21:01.351
I am really excited today
to be here with Mike Suby

21:01.460 --> 21:02.813
the composer of
"Pretty Little Liars."

21:02.920 --> 21:04.581
The man whose music keeps you
on the edge of your seat

21:04.690 --> 21:06.829
every week and, uh,
pulls at your heart strings.

21:08.852 --> 21:08.960
Welcome, Mike, and tank you
for slitting witlin us.”

21:08.960 --> 21:09.927
Thanks for having me.

21:10.030 --> 21:11.395
Looking at the five-year

21:11.500 --> 21:12.797
time jump that we're taking

21:12.900 --> 21:15.539
are you setting
a new tone with score?

21:15.640 --> 21:16.698
Are there any
challenges musically?

21:16.800 --> 21:18.563
Are you adding
any new instruments?

21:18.670 --> 21:21.969
In episodic television,
long-form episodic television

21:22.080 --> 21:25.777
uh, we're constantly writing
new themes, finding new palates

21:25.880 --> 21:28.474
'developing characters,
character relationships.‘

21:28.580 --> 21:31.344
So it's something
we're doing every week

21:31.450 --> 21:32.940
and over time anyways.

21:33.050 --> 21:36.315
[instrumental music]

21:38.830 --> 21:41.025
This is a special situation

21:41.130 --> 21:42.825
but it's really
an extension of that.

21:42.930 --> 21:44.022
Of that constantly
evolving score.

21:44.130 --> 21:45.666
- It-it.. Yeah. I mean..
- Okay.

21:45.770 --> 21:48.568
So what I did for the ﬁve-year
jump, I incorporated

21:48.670 --> 21:50.558
some new elements to the score.

21:50.670 --> 21:51.830
Something new
for the viewer to say

21:51.940 --> 21:53.737
"Okay, this sounds
a bit different."

21:53.840 --> 21:56.331
[indistinct chattering]

21:56.440 --> 21:57.907
Well, I just
messaged her today..

21:59.280 --> 22:00.577
The girls are older, they've
had their life experience

22:01.680 --> 22:02.578
and something to reflect
that they have

22:03.650 --> 22:04.480
a little bit more
under their belt.

22:05.520 --> 22:06.316
_A_little more
sophisticated language.

22:06.890 --> 22:08.551
[indistinct chattering]

22:11.860 --> 22:13.555
(female narrator)
Coming up, the cast reveals

22:13.660 --> 22:15.719
the biggest changes
in the upcoming season.

22:15.830 --> 22:17.969
There's a lot more skin.
I feel like..

22:18.070 --> 22:19.822
I feel like I had to show
a lot more skin.

22:19.930 --> 22:22.433
And see just where
the five-year leap takes them.

22:22.540 --> 22:24.098
It was scripted
as a heart-shaped bed.

22:24.210 --> 22:27.839
When "Pretty Little Liars,
Five Years Forward" returns.

22:29.980 --> 22:33.006
* Sometimes you make it
impossible.. **

22:33.110 --> 22:34.646
- Guess who?
- Oh, my gosh.

22:35.880 --> 22:36.869
Emily tweeted, "I feel like
a part of my life

22:37.890 --> 22:38.618
"has been finally
been answered.

22:39.750 --> 22:40.956
I can't wait
for the new season of PLL."

22:41.060 --> 22:42.948
- Hi!
- Oh, hi.

22:43.060 --> 22:44.482
[indistinct chatter]

22:47.560 --> 22:48.595
[gasping]
What just happened!

22:48.700 --> 22:50.395
Robert tweeted, "Did anyone get

22:50.500 --> 22:51.728
"the moms out of the basement?

22:51.830 --> 22:53.058
"I'm really worried for them.

22:53.170 --> 22:54.899
I think they ran out of wine."

22:55.000 --> 22:57.867
Okay, well, we lived off
some of, uh, Mr. Delaurentis'

22:57.970 --> 22:59.039
Scotch for a while..

23:00.140 --> 23:02.370
Then after that, after that,
he came down to do laundry

23:02.480 --> 23:03.879
and he found us.
That's-that's my theory.

23:03.980 --> 23:05.845
Wait a minute. Do your think
Peter Hastings

23:05.950 --> 23:07.770
washes his own shorts?

23:07.880 --> 23:10.678
You know, no, it couldn't have
been more than a day.

23:10.790 --> 23:13.509
I'm hoping that Officer Toby,
like, rode in

23:13.620 --> 23:14.655
'and saved us all.'

23:14.760 --> 23:16.512
I think the girls probably

23:16.620 --> 23:17.826
finally figured out
that we were gone.

23:17.930 --> 23:20.148
I think it may've been,
like, months later.

23:20.260 --> 23:21.818
But I think they finally
realized..

23:21.930 --> 23:23.591
- 'Months later?‘
- 'Months later.'

23:23.700 --> 23:24.997
Have you've seen my mom?

23:25.100 --> 23:26.567
Hi. I'm Bryan Holdman.

23:26.670 --> 23:28.729
Co-Executive Producer
of "Pretty Little Liars."

23:28.840 --> 23:31.638
And I'm here to interview, uh,
some guys from our art, set-tech

23:31.740 --> 23:33.708
and props departments.

23:33.810 --> 23:36.028
Uh, Chris?

23:36.140 --> 23:37.641
W-what are you doing?

23:42.080 --> 23:43.616
Hi, Bryan. I'm, uh..

23:43.720 --> 23:45.540
I'm having a little trouble
letting go of "A."

23:45.650 --> 23:48.483
The layers we built together

23:48.590 --> 23:49.659
all those layers.

23:49.760 --> 23:52.786
And the dolls, so many dolls.

23:52.890 --> 23:57.122
Chris, I think we all would
agree that "A" was an important

23:57.230 --> 23:59.824
part of the show but,
um, we've moved on.

24:01.570 --> 24:02.696
You're right.

24:02.800 --> 24:04.199
There's a whole new brand
of terror

24:04.310 --> 24:05.902
and torment coming to town
and these

24:06.010 --> 24:08.638
Pretty Little Liars
do not see it coming.

24:08.740 --> 24:10.844
- No.
- 'Time to embrace the future.‘

24:10.950 --> 24:12.941
And on that note,
1-1 have something

24:13.050 --> 24:14.779
I wanna share with you and..

24:14.880 --> 24:16.677
I have to admit
I'm pretty excited about it.

24:16.780 --> 24:18.179
Actually, Chris.
Uh, you know, uh..

24:18.290 --> 24:19.643
They have to see this.

24:19.750 --> 24:21.012
Don't.. Ple.. Don't do that.

24:21.120 --> 24:25.750
I give you the future face
of terror in Rosewood.

24:25.860 --> 24:27.725
[beeping]

24:29.030 --> 24:31.863
So guys, in five years' time,
a lot can change in Rosewood.

24:31.970 --> 24:35.736
And, you know, some of our old
familiar sets have gone away.

24:35.840 --> 24:37.808
Well, if you didn't know
what this place was

24:37.910 --> 24:39.707
you'd never know
what this place was.

24:39.810 --> 24:42.734
One set, with a sort of five
years later facelift

24:42.840 --> 24:44.501
which we're sitting in,
it's the Radley Sanitarium

24:44.610 --> 24:46.475
and now it is a hotel.

24:46.580 --> 24:48.013
- It is.
- It's a boutique hotel.

24:48.120 --> 24:51.749
Are there actual physical parts
of this set that were

24:51.850 --> 24:54.614
part of the Radley of old
that people have seen before?

24:54.720 --> 24:58.622
There are a few of the
arched doorways that were

24:58.730 --> 25:00.789
in the underground
Radley tunnels.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.720
Starts with the art director
and the set designer

25:02.830 --> 25:05.697
drawing it and then goes
to construction and paint

25:05.800 --> 25:07.734
and labor and plasters

25:07.840 --> 25:10.263
and grips to bring it all
and put it all together.

25:10.370 --> 25:12.133
- That's a lot of hands.
- It's a cast of thousands.

25:12.240 --> 25:14.572
It's a cast of thousands to make
it all look real and..

25:14.680 --> 25:16.602
Like it's-like it's just
a boutique hotel.

25:16.710 --> 25:18.905
Yeah, exactly.

25:19.010 --> 25:20.500
(Marlene)
'We're here in Spencer' barn'

25:20.620 --> 25:21.917
'and it's made
such a transformation'

25:22.020 --> 25:23.908
from _the barn we saw
in the pilot.

25:24.020 --> 25:26.045
I think what people don't know
and it's so fun

25:26.150 --> 25:27.981
and it probably never occurs
to people that

25:28.090 --> 25:30.854
'Spencer's barn was already
redone in the pilot.‘

25:30.960 --> 25:32.587
[thuderclap]

25:32.690 --> 25:33.952
The first thing is
"Previously," right?

25:34.060 --> 25:35.755
And then we jump
to modern times

25:35.860 --> 25:37.054
and the barn was redone

25:37.160 --> 25:39.526
but we've never seen
the inside of the barn

25:39.630 --> 25:41.530
redone until this season.

25:41.640 --> 25:44.200
Cause we just redid it
for-for our-our time jump.

25:44.310 --> 25:46.301
_ I love that set. I think
it's one my favorite new sets

25:46.410 --> 25:47.536
that we have.
It's so cozy.

25:47.640 --> 25:48.607
- Yeah.
- I love it.

25:48.710 --> 25:51.178
So, should we say
who's living in Spencer's barn?

25:51.280 --> 25:54.078
- I'm living in my barn.
- Finally. Six years later.

25:54.180 --> 25:56.273
And also, it was kind of
like a crossover from the books

25:56.380 --> 25:58.940
'cause Spencer wanted to be
an interior designer'

25:59.050 --> 26:01.257
And so the feel like
the whole thing was that

26:01.360 --> 26:03.726
she got to redesign the barn

26:03.830 --> 26:05.252
but then Melissa
got to live there.

26:05.360 --> 26:07.692
It is very cool to kinda
have a homecoming

26:07.800 --> 26:09.256
after the time jump
and, like, Spencer finally

26:09.360 --> 26:13.023
gets to live in the space
that she designed for herself

26:13.130 --> 26:16.167
um, while she's helping her mom
run for a seat in the senate.

26:16.270 --> 26:19.262
After five years' time,
a lot can change in Rosewood

26:19.370 --> 26:20.678
and that meant
that some of our

26:20.780 --> 26:22.031
long-standing sets
had to go away.

26:22.140 --> 26:23.801
They were taken down
overnight.

26:23.910 --> 26:25.207
Um, and in their place

26:25.310 --> 26:27.915
we immediately started
building the new sets.

26:28.020 --> 26:29.817
So the next morning,
actors would come in

26:29.920 --> 26:32.889
and a place that had been
their bedroom for six years

26:32.990 --> 26:34.287
- was just gone.
- Just gone.

26:34.390 --> 26:36.813
Did any of the actors
have a chance to say goodbye

26:36.920 --> 26:39.627
to their, you know,
bedrooms of five-six years?

26:39.730 --> 26:40.924
No, I don't think they did.

26:41.030 --> 26:43.021
I think they arrived
the next morning

26:43.130 --> 26:44.791
and the sets were gone,
and we were down

26:44.900 --> 26:46.822
to sheets of linoleum
on the floor

26:46.930 --> 26:48.295
and sets were history.

26:48.400 --> 26:49.765
Wow. Just an empty space.

26:49.870 --> 26:51.337
I think several of them
were quite shocked

26:52.710 --> 26:55.008
that they walked to the stage
and saw the vacant hole

26:55.110 --> 26:56.873
where their homes
once lived.

26:56.980 --> 26:58.174
You know, week to week,
on our show

26:58.280 --> 27:00.714
the liars are always following
mystery or romance

27:00.820 --> 27:01.912
to some new location.

27:02.020 --> 27:04.944
What we refer_ to in-house
as our swmg sets.

27:05.050 --> 27:07.985
Um, are there any fun,
crazy swing sets

27:08.090 --> 27:09.318
that you guys had

27:09.420 --> 27:11.684
a challenge or a pleasure
creating in 63?

27:11.790 --> 27:14.691
Oh, yes. I won't discuss
what the scene was.

27:14.800 --> 27:17.189
Uh, but it was great fun
because it was scripted

27:17.300 --> 27:18.790
as a heart-shaped bed.

27:18.900 --> 27:20.959
It was a bit of a, um..

27:21.070 --> 27:22.662
...scavenger hunt
to find the pieces

27:22.770 --> 27:23.907
and create the visual.

27:24.010 --> 27:25.363
And wandering
through the prop house

27:25.470 --> 27:28.030
I found a round bed

27:28.140 --> 27:31.109
a light-up heart
and a gold lame heart

27:31.210 --> 27:33.201
in the prop house
in three separate places

27:33.310 --> 27:36.211
and married them together
and created a heart-shaped bed.

27:36.320 --> 27:37.639
Then from there,
I just went,

27:37.750 --> 27:39.980
"How over the top
can I make this?"

27:40.090 --> 27:41.352
[laughing]

27:41.460 --> 27:42.711
It was great fun to do.

27:42.820 --> 27:43.787
- Very over the top.
- Great fun.

27:43.890 --> 27:45.084
Perfectly over the top.

27:45.190 --> 27:46.327
And how about you?

27:46.430 --> 27:48.022
My favorite was probably
the studio.

27:48.130 --> 27:50.223
We did it in the back lot
in an empty space

27:50.330 --> 27:52.127
and just brought in
a few walls.

27:52.230 --> 27:54.664
So you just have something
for the eye to focus to

27:54.770 --> 27:57.238
and a few pieces of set dressing
and some carpet.

27:57.340 --> 28:00.332
You never notice the big,
black empty void that it was in

28:00.440 --> 28:04.274
and it worked perfectly with
just a few pieces brought in.

28:04.380 --> 28:06.769
I won't give any spoilers
but what is also great

28:06.880 --> 28:07.972
_ about that set is
it gives us a glimpse

28:08.080 --> 28:11.846
into the work life of one of the
pretty little liars, uh..

28:11.950 --> 28:14.350
...five years later,
which I think is exciting too.

28:14.460 --> 28:16.109
(female narrator)
Coming up,
the pretty little liars

28:16.220 --> 28:17.926
take us back
to the beginning.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.258
That's the scene
that sort of started it all

28:19.360 --> 28:21.225
- when we have that moment.
- Gotcha!

28:21.330 --> 28:22.695
[all screaming]

28:22.800 --> 28:24.222
And later, our second exclusive

28:24.330 --> 28:27.094
never before seen
"Pretty Little Liars" moment.

28:27.200 --> 28:29.430
And I thought you were done
lurking in the shadows.

28:29.540 --> 28:30.962
When we return.

28:33.240 --> 28:34.901
Are we to say that
we're not afraid of her?

28:35.010 --> 28:36.375
Is that the truth?

28:36.480 --> 28:37.378
That we're not afraid?

28:37.480 --> 28:38.970
Pll4eve tweeted"

28:39.080 --> 28:41.014
"Th_e liars are still
looking for answers

28:41.120 --> 28:43.247
"so they're doing
what they're really good at..

28:43.350 --> 28:45.386
...snooping."

28:45.490 --> 28:47.378
"A" camera marker
and marking.

28:47.490 --> 28:48.809
'Nice!‘

28:51.390 --> 28:53.858
Jana tweeted, "Hanna has
always been my favorite liar."

28:53.960 --> 28:55.325
"Now she gets to travel
the world

28:55.430 --> 28:56.829
and works in fashion."

28:56.930 --> 28:58.488
Hashtag mydream.

28:58.600 --> 29:00.067
"A" camera mark.

29:01.300 --> 29:03.029
"How luclq am I
to have something

29:03.140 --> 29:05.768
that makes saying goodbye
so hard."

29:05.870 --> 29:07.269
What brilliant scholar
said that?

29:07.370 --> 29:08.337
Winnie the Pooh.

29:08.440 --> 29:09.976
[chuckling]

29:10.080 --> 29:11.843
(Marlene)
'Last we saw was our-our
lovely goodbye scene'

29:11.950 --> 29:13.406
'in front of Alison's house
which..'

29:13.510 --> 29:14.545
Oh, that scene
was so beautiful, yeah.

29:14.650 --> 29:17.175
Let's talk about that.
What did that goodbye feel like?

29:17.280 --> 29:19.987
I found myself actually getting
emotional, like, for real.

29:20.090 --> 29:21.455
Not, like, acting
'cause it was just like..

29:21.560 --> 29:22.686
it was SUCh a sweet scene.

29:22.790 --> 29:25.429
Yeah, I think all the girls,
although it was like, really sad

29:25.530 --> 29:27.896
to leave one another,
we were kinda ready to be like

29:28.000 --> 29:29.820
okay, there's a next chapter
of our life, you know?

29:29.930 --> 29:31.227
It was sad,
but it was also exciting.

29:33.270 --> 29:36.990
that really, I'm sure, I mean,
it's bittersweet a little bit.

29:37.100 --> 29:39.762
It was saying goodbye
to your teenage selves.

29:39.870 --> 29:41.804
Yeah, um, it was,
it was, uh..

29:41.910 --> 29:44.003
(Marlene)
'And to "A." It was goodbye
to the "A" story.‘

29:44.110 --> 29:46.442
- Goodbye.
- You gonna be okay?

29:46.550 --> 29:48.040
Yeah.

29:48.150 --> 29:50.880
I spent my whole life dreaming
about get away from here.

29:50.990 --> 29:52.981
But right now, this is
the only place I wanna be.

29:53.090 --> 29:55.979
It was definitely
kind of the funny

29:56.090 --> 29:59.059
thing that we had to, like,
I think it was the next day

29:59.160 --> 30:01.958
continue shooting,
and so it was that kinda thing

30:02.060 --> 30:03.960
where you were like, okay,
so go into the emotion

30:04.070 --> 30:06.197
of what it would really
be like to say goodbye.

30:06.300 --> 30:09.098
Like, and-and so we did it
and then afterwards, it was like

30:09.200 --> 30:11.009
"That was beautiful.
Okay, here's your call time

30:11.110 --> 30:12.998
for tomorrow," and we were
just like, "Oh, wait a minute."

30:13.110 --> 30:16.477
But I think also for me,
for Spencer especially

30:16.580 --> 30:19.048
saying goodbye to Ali

30:19.150 --> 30:20.947
and, like,
what that relationship was

30:21.050 --> 30:22.938
and for some reason,
it felt like

30:23.050 --> 30:24.586
I was gonna
take these girls with me

30:24.690 --> 30:26.510
wherever I went as Spencer.

30:26.620 --> 30:28.815
There was something about
leaving Alison behind

30:28.920 --> 30:30.182
in that front yard

30:31.390 --> 30:32.948
that was saying goodbye
to Spencer's childhood.

30:34.030 --> 30:34.450
I decided it was
such a sweet moment

30:35.660 --> 30:38.094
and you really saw the five
girls back where we started.

30:38.200 --> 30:39.963
I was curious since
we're here in Spencer's barn

30:40.070 --> 30:41.389
and it's made
such a transformation

30:41.500 --> 30:43.263
from _the barn we saw
in the pilot.

30:43.370 --> 30:46.237
How does it feel to think
about where you are now

30:46.340 --> 30:47.978
in the barn versus
where you were

30:48.080 --> 30:49.502
when we shot the pilot
in Vancouver?

30:49.610 --> 30:51.168
Gotcha!

30:51.280 --> 30:52.838
[all screaming]

30:52.950 --> 30:54.872
(Spencer)
'That's so not funny, Alison.‘

30:54.980 --> 30:57.119
I thought it was hilarious.

30:57.220 --> 30:59.415
First of all, it's like
five degrees in Vancouver

30:59.520 --> 31:00.509
when we were filming this.

31:00.620 --> 31:02.258
We were all like huddled
in a corner

31:02.360 --> 31:03.418
all, like, snuggled-up.

31:04.390 --> 31:05.584
It was freezing cold.
We were all in, like

31:05.690 --> 31:07.487
down jackets
and, it was a really..

31:07.590 --> 31:09.524
cra.. I mean,
that was an all-night shoot.

31:09.630 --> 31:10.927
Friends share secrets.

31:11.030 --> 31:12.588
That's what keeps us close.

31:14.070 --> 31:14.092
(Aria)
That's the scene_
that sort of started it all

31:15.200 --> 31:16.428
when we all wake up,
we're discombobulated.

31:17.840 --> 31:19.398
Spencer's gone, I wake up
and then we have that moment.

31:19.510 --> 31:23.105
- Where is Ali and Spencer?
- We don't know.

31:23.210 --> 31:26.008
And then I remember
being so cold

31:26.110 --> 31:27.975
and because I was outside
of the barn

31:28.080 --> 31:30.310
and they, I was walking in,
and I was back lit

31:30.420 --> 31:32.149
so they just kept on
telling me, they were like

31:32.250 --> 31:33.979
first of all, we can see your
shoulders are up like this

31:34.090 --> 31:35.409
'cause I was wearing,
like, nothing.

31:35.520 --> 31:37.215
- And your skin is purple.
- And your skin is blue.

31:37.320 --> 31:39.550
So, uh, they were like, so
you have to relax your shoulders

31:39.660 --> 31:41.992
and when you come forward,
because you're being back lit

31:42.100 --> 31:44.921
um...don't breathe
because we can see

31:45.030 --> 31:46.167
the air,
we can see your breath.

31:46.270 --> 31:48.033
And it was supposed to be
Labor Day weekend.

31:48.140 --> 31:49.892
- That was like, hot.
- It was supposed to be summer.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.103
I do you remember you having
to put ice cubes

31:51.210 --> 31:52.268
in your mouth, right?

31:52.370 --> 31:54.201
- Oh, yeah.
- Wait, why? Why?

31:54.310 --> 31:55.538
Because it would cool down
her breath.

31:55.640 --> 31:56.572
To cool down my temperature.

31:56.680 --> 31:57.908
'So you don't see the breath.‘

31:58.010 --> 31:59.147
So you wouldn't see
the breath.

31:59.250 --> 32:00.547
So I_remember
you eating ice cubes..

32:00.650 --> 32:01.571
What do you mean
she's gone?

32:01.680 --> 32:03.443
I've looked everywhere for her.

32:05.620 --> 32:07.178
Think I heard a scream.

32:07.290 --> 32:09.349
(Troian)
'I also remember, like,
waiting for you guys'

32:09.460 --> 32:11.257
'to get set in the barn
and just standing out'

32:11.360 --> 32:14.193
in, like, the coldest
dark night

32:14.300 --> 32:17.098
and just being like,
"I'm so warm, I'm so warm"

32:17.200 --> 32:18.360
and it wasn't working
at all.

32:18.470 --> 32:21.098
And then_ I remember
we got into the van

32:21.200 --> 32:23.134
and-and you pulled up
your phone, and you were like

32:23.240 --> 32:25.936
"I have an idea
for the theme show's song."

32:26.040 --> 32:27.200
- 'Yes.‘
- I remember this.

32:27.310 --> 32:29.130
And you were there
and we listened to it

32:29.240 --> 32:31.208
and we were like, "Mar,
you have to hear this show.."

32:31.310 --> 32:32.948
...and it was our theme song.

32:33.050 --> 32:35.075
You couldn't, like, commit to
it. You were like, yeah, I guess

32:35.180 --> 32:36.716
I'll just ask if it can be,
but I remember, like,

32:36.820 --> 32:38.344
you were playing it
off of your phone

32:38.450 --> 32:40.338
You were like, "Please,
it'd be so cool if this was.."

32:40.450 --> 32:42.179
It was, yeah, I mean,
people think that song

32:42.290 --> 32:43.382
was written for the show.

32:43.490 --> 32:44.229
Yeah, it's so perfect.

32:44.330 --> 32:46.059
But truthfully,
Ashley found it

32:46.160 --> 32:47.320
in the dark of night.

32:47.430 --> 32:48.397
You're welcome.

32:48.500 --> 32:49.956
[indistinct chatter]

32:50.060 --> 32:52.062
I remember pigtunia
for some reason.

32:52.170 --> 32:54.035
She's always been
beside you.

32:54.140 --> 32:55.630
Scary pigtunia.

32:55.740 --> 32:57.537
...you on the floor,
Ashley and I using the excuse

32:57.640 --> 32:58.959
that we would be cuddled
on the couch together

32:59.070 --> 33:00.503
just to, like, stay warm.

33:00.610 --> 33:02.976
You were like, "We'll be on
the couch, under the blanket."

33:03.080 --> 33:04.240
That was probably
the beginning of Butter Benzo.

33:04.350 --> 33:05.601
Yeah, that was probably
the beginning.

33:05.710 --> 33:07.541
And then I remember having to,
like, sneak-drink.

33:07.650 --> 33:09.641
We were sneak-drinking
in that barn and now..

33:09.750 --> 33:10.717
Yeah, from the red solo cups.

33:10.820 --> 33:12.242
[indistinct chatter]

33:13.490 --> 33:15.651
You were having a little
wine and cheese party.

33:15.760 --> 33:17.352
[chuckles]
Yeah. Yeah.

33:17.460 --> 33:21.294
It's just weird to think that,
like, I mean, I was 19..

33:21.400 --> 33:23.129
...back then and you too.

33:23.230 --> 33:24.993
- Yeah, we were babes.
- Oh, you were 20.

33:25.100 --> 33:28.194
But it was just, it's just so
weird that we've actually, like

33:28.300 --> 33:29.699
most of my 205 have been
on this show

33:29.800 --> 33:31.165
and, like,
now being in this

33:31.270 --> 33:33.363
like, six years later,
it's so crazy.

33:33.470 --> 33:35.108
It's been_
such an experience.

33:35.210 --> 33:37.508
We all kinda started
when we were kids, you know?

33:37.610 --> 33:38.747
For some of us,
this is our first job.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.272
For me, I'll speak for myself.

33:40.380 --> 33:42.416
It was my first job,
literally right out of college.

33:42.520 --> 33:45.114
It's been such a
sort of transformative

33:45.220 --> 33:47.415
and wonderful experience
and as much as, you know

33:47.520 --> 33:49.681
there can be long hours,
and especially for, like

33:49.790 --> 33:51.758
the-the four leading ladies.

33:51.860 --> 33:53.555
Like, they-they're here
a lot.

33:53.660 --> 33:55.548
And that can be pretty...
pretty grueling.

33:55.660 --> 33:58.367
But I think I will_ be
very, very sad when it's done.

33:58.470 --> 34:00.358
You know, one the great
privileges of being able

34:00.470 --> 34:02.734
'to work on a series
that's long-running'

34:02.840 --> 34:04.569
and especially
with young people.

34:04.670 --> 34:07.161
You're watching young people
evolve, their talents evolve.

34:07.270 --> 34:09.079
You're watching them grow up
in front of the camera

34:09.180 --> 34:10.807
and of course,
behind the scenes.

34:10.910 --> 34:12.639
Well, the funny thing is
with Lucy, I mean

34:12.750 --> 34:15.639
she was uber-professional
from, like, day one.

34:15.750 --> 34:18.583
I mean, she just is. I mean,
she doesn't make a mistake.

34:18.690 --> 34:19.918
She's kind to everybody

34:20.020 --> 34:22.386
and she's just, she's really
good at what she does.

34:22.490 --> 34:25.050
How will you go with
working with Ashley Benson?

34:25.160 --> 34:27.219
Well, Ashley started

34:27.330 --> 34:29.195
at I think the age of 19
or something

34:29.300 --> 34:30.449
I mean, she was young.

34:30.560 --> 34:32.266
But all of us,
the whole crew

34:32.370 --> 34:33.689
and everybody, you know,
we've been her family

34:33.800 --> 34:35.597
for those years
and we've all gotten

34:35.700 --> 34:38.737
to see her grow through
those years, and it's great.

34:38.840 --> 34:40.137
How about Troian?

34:40.240 --> 34:41.468
Well, she was born 80.

34:41.580 --> 34:42.672
'Yeah. True.'

34:43.680 --> 34:44.669
- 'She's an old soul.‘
- 'She's an old soul.‘

34:45.680 --> 34:47.671
'And she's just gotten lovelier
with each year.'

34:47.780 --> 34:50.476
And Sasha, we've watched Sasha
grow up in the set..

34:50.580 --> 34:53.583
She's definitely.. Gosh, she was
so young when she started..

34:53.690 --> 34:56.113
But still, I mean

34:56.220 --> 34:57.858
crazily mature
for her age

34:57.960 --> 34:59.689
- Also an_ old soul.
- P0ised.

34:59.790 --> 35:03.351
And Shay, you know, has been
so special to this cast.

35:03.460 --> 35:06.588
And Emily's character
has been since day one

35:06.700 --> 35:08.691
you know, much of the heart
of the show..

35:08.800 --> 35:12.804
She's just beautiful
and has such grace and

35:12.910 --> 35:15.777
uh, sweet, sweet heart,
sweet spirit.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.768
And a lot of followers.

35:17.880 --> 35:18.778
A lot of followers.

35:18.880 --> 35:20.745
A lot of Instagram followers.

35:22.320 --> 35:23.241
(female narrator)
Coming up,
see a confrontation that you

35:23.980 --> 35:25.117
haven't see anywhere else.

35:25.990 --> 35:27.241
They're the ultimate frenemies,
I think.

35:27.350 --> 35:29.284
And then, discover the new more

35:29.390 --> 35:31.688
sinister threat
to the people of Rosewood.

35:31.790 --> 35:32.779
This isn't happening.

35:32.890 --> 35:34.619
When we continue.

35:34.730 --> 35:37.790
* Somebody misses you
when you're away.. *

35:37.900 --> 35:39.720
Betty Who tweeted "So excited

35:39.830 --> 35:42.264
"my music is on the "Pretty
Little Liars" special.

35:42.370 --> 35:44.338
"Such a fan of PLL,
and I can't wait

35:44.440 --> 35:46.601
for the new season in January."

35:47.870 --> 35:50.338
* Oh somebody loves you *

35:51.810 --> 35:53.277
PrettyKisses_A said

35:53.380 --> 35:55.245
"I love all the Liars new looks

35:55.350 --> 35:57.272
"but Spencer's new look
is my favorite.

35:57.380 --> 35:59.143
Those bangs!"

35:59.250 --> 36:00.410
[indistinct]

36:01.760 --> 36:03.648
And now, a brand new scene

36:03.760 --> 36:06.479
from the middle of our
five-year time jump.

36:06.590 --> 36:09.252
You won't see this
anywhere else.

36:12.570 --> 36:15.494
Oscar Wilde once said
"That life imitates art

36:15.600 --> 36:17.830
more than art imitates life."

36:17.940 --> 36:19.567
Now to me..

36:21.410 --> 36:23.435
...to me, that means

36:23.540 --> 36:26.668
that life and art
can become so blurry

36:26.780 --> 36:29.169
that it's hard to tell
the difference between the two.

36:29.280 --> 36:30.747
[bell rings]

36:30.850 --> 36:33.717
Alright, well, think about this
over the weekend

36:33.820 --> 36:35.708
because there will be
an essay on it, okay?

36:40.330 --> 36:43.424
[dramatic music]

36:47.730 --> 36:49.732
Mona.

36:49.840 --> 36:52.331
I thought you were done
lurking in the shadows.

36:52.440 --> 36:54.476
Alison DeLaurentis.

36:54.580 --> 36:57.333
Never thought you'd be the one
to stick around Rosewood.

36:57.440 --> 36:59.408
After you ran me out of town
with a pitchfork

36:59.510 --> 37:01.205
I actually came to like
this place.

37:01.320 --> 37:02.673
And a teacher even.

37:02.780 --> 37:05.419
Considering my limited
high school experience

37:05.520 --> 37:06.919
I'd have to say I missed it.

37:07.020 --> 37:09.853
Well, I'm in town for my let

37:09.960 --> 37:12.485
and I thought we could go out
for a drink and celebrate.

37:15.030 --> 37:16.895
What about
your college friends?

37:17.000 --> 37:18.991
Well, they threw me
a party at, uh, Duke

37:19.100 --> 37:21.364
but it wasn't the same.

37:21.470 --> 37:23.688
Come on, don't you have
five minutes for some nostalgia

37:23.800 --> 37:26.234
and a little _
buttercream frosting?

37:28.610 --> 37:29.577
'Kay.

37:31.550 --> 37:32.903
Have you talked to the girls?

37:33.010 --> 37:35.240
I actually invited them back
for a little reunion

37:35.350 --> 37:36.510
but en vain.

37:36.620 --> 37:39.282
I spoke to Aria
on her birthday.

37:39.390 --> 37:40.641
She's been writing a lot.

37:40.750 --> 37:43.389
She's been reading
her short stories

37:43.490 --> 37:45.424
at open mic night
on Harvard Square.

37:45.530 --> 37:48.522
Did you see Spencer's pic of
the White House rose garden?

37:50.730 --> 37:52.869
the first lady if she could
replace the rose bushes

37:52.970 --> 37:54.528
for something more
eco friendly.

37:54.640 --> 37:56.767
Hanna and _I went to Miami
on spring break..

37:56.870 --> 37:59.634
...and we crashed a party
at Matt Damon's house.

37:59.740 --> 38:00.934
Crazy.

38:01.040 --> 38:02.405
Uh, any word from Em?

38:02.510 --> 38:03.670
The last time I talked to her

38:03.780 --> 38:06.544
she was on her way
up to Stanford to visit Paige.

38:06.650 --> 38:08.447
I think they've been
seeing each other.

38:08.550 --> 38:09.972
Are they together?

38:10.080 --> 38:12.412
You know, Ali, considering
everything we've been through

38:12.520 --> 38:14.681
I never thought
I'd make it to 21.

38:16.960 --> 38:18.825
You're not here to celebrate.

38:20.430 --> 38:21.795
You're here about her.

38:21.900 --> 38:22.958
[intense music]

38:23.060 --> 38:24.925
You applied for a summer job
at Well-Be.

38:25.030 --> 38:27.294
And as Charlotte's warden,
no less.

38:31.170 --> 38:34.708
And Mina Davis...how creative?

38:34.810 --> 38:36.971
Isn't that
your mother's maiden name?

38:37.080 --> 38:39.844
Dr. Rollins didn't recognize
your name on the application

38:39.950 --> 38:41.747
but saw you leave.

38:41.850 --> 38:44.444
Ah, you looked familiar.

38:44.550 --> 38:46.586
You botched your application.

38:46.690 --> 38:48.749
I tried to visit
Charlotte legit the first time

38:48.860 --> 38:50.555
and the hospital
wouldn't let me in.

38:50.660 --> 38:53.458
You needed to put on
scrubs for a visit?

38:53.560 --> 38:54.959
I didn't expect to get
much out of her

38:55.060 --> 38:56.493
from one rendezvous.

38:56.600 --> 38:58.056
Figured it might take a few.

38:58.160 --> 39:00.060
What do you want?

39:00.170 --> 39:02.331
I saw you've been posting
on social.

39:02.440 --> 39:03.634
Seems like
she's getting better.

39:04.140 --> 39:05.334
She is.

39:05.440 --> 39:06.407
Should Charlotte ever get

39:06.510 --> 39:07.659
cell phone privileges

39:07.770 --> 39:09.977
what's she gonna post?
About us.

39:10.080 --> 39:13.846
I've spent every day with her
for the last four years.

39:14.820 --> 39:15.946
She's changed.

39:16.980 --> 39:18.516
I'm about to start
a career in the public eye.

39:18.620 --> 39:20.815
I need to know her intentions.

39:20.920 --> 39:21.909
[music continues]

39:22.020 --> 39:24.784
Her intentions
are to get well.

39:24.890 --> 39:28.394
She was a master
at playing the game.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.491
Even better than me.

39:30.600 --> 39:33.489
You may trust her,
but I don't think I ever could.

39:34.470 --> 39:36.028
When can I see her?

39:36.140 --> 39:37.630
When she gets out.

39:38.470 --> 39:40.358
And I know she will.

39:40.470 --> 39:42.574
Charlotte's been working
very hard.

39:54.490 --> 39:57.118
[sighs]
Hi, it's me.

39:57.220 --> 39:59.154
Mona was here.

39:59.260 --> 40:01.524
She wanted to talk
about Charlotte.

40:04.970 --> 40:06.164
She wants to see Charlotte.

40:06.270 --> 40:07.669
She wants to see Charlotte

40:07.770 --> 40:11.661
and obviously,
Alison isn't really liking that.

40:11.770 --> 40:13.965
You've become very protective
of Charlotte which is

40:14.070 --> 40:15.071
it's-it's a beautiful thing.

40:15.180 --> 40:16.738
anditths"
I think the whole

40:18.010 --> 40:20.501
DeLaurentis story and-and seeing
how these sisters have survived

40:20.610 --> 40:21.679
along with your brother.

40:21.780 --> 40:23.668
to me is just like
such a great..

40:23.780 --> 40:25.680
That's how I think
you and Charlotte are alike.

40:25.790 --> 40:27.439
You're-you're both survivors.

40:27.550 --> 40:29.450
Success story, in a way.

40:29.560 --> 40:31.687
Alison brings you guys back

40:31.790 --> 40:34.429
because she-she needs
your help with Charlotte

40:34.530 --> 40:36.418
but an event occurs that-that

40:36.530 --> 40:38.498
forces you guys to stay

40:38.600 --> 40:40.989
in Rosewood
and out of that event

40:41.100 --> 40:43.159
a new big bad is born.

40:43.270 --> 40:44.191
The big bad.

40:44.300 --> 40:45.437
We can't tell you
what happens

40:45.540 --> 40:46.507
when we get back to Rosewood.

40:46.610 --> 40:51.104
However, the girls begin
to again receive messages.

40:51.210 --> 40:53.144
They know
it's not from Charlotte.

40:53.250 --> 40:55.741
Um, and this time,
it feels very different.

40:55.850 --> 40:57.579
It is not just
a manipulation game.

40:57.680 --> 40:59.648
There's something that's
very, very dark and twisted.

40:59.750 --> 41:01.809
This time, it's no longer about

41:01.920 --> 41:05.083
"I'm gonna expose
some secret that you have"

41:05.190 --> 41:06.225
or I'm gonna, you know

41:08.090 --> 41:09.591
the Orchid Scholarship.

41:09.700 --> 41:11.793
You know what I mean?
It's paran0ia, blackmail.

41:11.900 --> 41:14.460
It's a
life-threatening situation..

41:14.570 --> 41:15.594
He's coming for you.

41:15.700 --> 41:17.099
[suspenseful music]

41:17.200 --> 41:19.031
- We have to go.
- Now, Alison!

41:19.140 --> 41:21.836
We came_ back here_
for you, Ali, so move it.

41:21.940 --> 41:23.976
[panﬁng]
It's too late.
He's already here.

41:24.080 --> 41:26.901
(Marlene)
Because it's life or death,
so quickly, you guys

41:27.010 --> 41:27.806
fight back right away.

41:28.580 --> 41:29.171
You're not victims. You're..

41:30.320 --> 41:30.877
You're, like, on top
of this right away.

41:31.690 --> 41:32.509
And I think
that's a big difference

41:33.390 --> 41:34.140
between moving forward
and the past.

41:34.890 --> 41:36.152
I'm just not
really good at this.

41:36.260 --> 41:37.989
Mm, I've got a lot of practice.

41:38.090 --> 41:41.651
* Breaking back into
the high school hallways.. *

41:41.760 --> 41:43.591
What words come to mind when you

41:43.700 --> 41:45.520
describe Season 6 be?

41:45.630 --> 41:47.769
* These are the glory days..

41:47.870 --> 41:50.031
- Classy, juicy..
- Deceptive.

41:50.140 --> 41:51.539
- Edgier.
- Spoolq.

41:51.640 --> 41:52.937
Do you still have nightmares?

41:53.040 --> 41:54.029
You're asking us to lie.

41:54.140 --> 41:55.209
It shouldn't cost you your life.

41:55.310 --> 41:57.505
- Dangerous.
- Sadder and badder.

41:57.610 --> 41:59.043
- Sexier. _
- There's a lot more skin.

41:59.150 --> 42:00.674
- I feel like--
- There's a lot more skin.

42:00.780 --> 42:01.872
I feel like I had to show
a lot more skin.

42:01.980 --> 42:04.983
* These are the glory days..

42:05.090 --> 42:07.046
Six B is going
to be scary as hell.

42:07.150 --> 42:09.914
And unlike anything
that you've ever seen before.

42:10.020 --> 42:12.682
The fans are just gonna
fall in love with it.
