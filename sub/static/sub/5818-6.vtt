DAMON: Previously on
The Vampire Diaries...

00:03.520 --> 00:04.806
What was the deal with you and Stefan?

00:05.000 --> 00:07.002
I was the first love of Stefan's life.

00:07.240 --> 00:08.366
Stefan, meet Julian.

00:08.560 --> 00:11.370
Julian was the man
you are not supposed to fall for.

00:11.560 --> 00:14.530
Does Stefan Salvatore know
that you're pregnant with his child?

00:15.240 --> 00:17.368
- What?
- I wanted to tell you in person.

00:18.480 --> 00:20.448
Julian made sure
there was nothing to tell.

00:22.080 --> 00:25.004
- Please don't tell anyone.
- I won't. I promise.

00:25.200 --> 00:27.680
RIC: The Phoenix Stone
brings people back from the dead.

00:28.520 --> 00:31.091
BONNIE: We made a mistake.
Jo was never in that stone.

00:31.280 --> 00:33.282
I put someone else in her body.

00:33.480 --> 00:35.244
- You're not my wife.
- I don't think I am.

00:35.440 --> 00:37.169
RIC: And we'll figure this out together.

00:37.360 --> 00:39.681
DAMON: Burning that bastard's body
would've been too good for Lily.

00:39.880 --> 00:41.689
I wanna give her that man

00:41.880 --> 00:43.564
that she's missed for 100 years.
And then...

00:43.760 --> 00:45.842
I want to rip his head off
right in front of her.

00:46.040 --> 00:48.884
VALERIE: Julian is the devil.
I can't let Lily bring him back.

00:49.080 --> 00:53.005
And if she does,
I will kill Julian myself.

00:59.680 --> 01:02.604
DAMON: So tell me,
what thoughts go through a man's mind

01:02.840 --> 01:04.126
before he decides,

01:04.680 --> 01:06.409
"I think I'll take
the ones with the roosters?"

01:06.600 --> 01:09.968
- I didn't pick those out.
- Hang on... Glitter.

01:10.160 --> 01:12.606
Yeah. Well, it goes with the territory.
What the hell do you want, Damon?

01:12.840 --> 01:14.808
When was the last time
you talked to your fiancÃ©e?

01:15.000 --> 01:18.721
I see word travels fast.
She texted earlier today, why?

01:18.920 --> 01:20.285
What time was it? And what'd she say?

01:22.760 --> 01:24.364
12:18. "Do we need bread?"

01:24.600 --> 01:25.840
Well, she's not answering her phone now.

01:26.040 --> 01:28.122
Yeah, well, she doesn't like
to answer the phone before broadcast.

01:28.320 --> 01:29.401
I don't care. Get her on the horn.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.648
Stefan's being hunted again
and it's only a matter of time

01:31.840 --> 01:34.491
before Caroline's the bait
that's used to lure him out.

01:36.040 --> 01:37.371
- CAROLINE: (ON TV) We apologize...
- Move.

01:37.520 --> 01:39.648
...for the interruption
to your current program.

01:39.840 --> 01:43.811
My name is Caroline,
I am a segment producer for KQBC News.

01:44.040 --> 01:45.769
Please listen carefully.

01:46.040 --> 01:49.328
I have an urgent message
for Stefan Salvatore.

01:50.520 --> 01:52.170
Oh, well. I guess the old ball and chain

01:52.360 --> 01:54.886
won't make it home for dinner after all,
will she?

02:01.520 --> 02:02.601
(STEFAN CLEARS TH ROAT)

02:02.800 --> 02:04.643
Hold the gun. Here you go.

02:04.840 --> 02:06.080
Now, the first thing you wanna do...

02:06.920 --> 02:09.844
(SPITS) Bite the paper off the cartridge,
like this.

02:10.840 --> 02:12.171
Hand me that ramrod.

02:13.480 --> 02:15.881
There you go. Now I want you to do it.

02:16.080 --> 02:18.128
Push it all the way down.

02:18.640 --> 02:19.721
Perfect.

02:19.920 --> 02:21.081
How far away can it shoot?

02:21.320 --> 02:24.290
Well, you see that, uh...

02:24.880 --> 02:26.928
See that tree over there
with the bark falling off?

02:27.560 --> 02:28.800
No.

02:29.040 --> 02:30.280
Pretty far then, huh?

02:30.480 --> 02:32.403
- Can I shoot it?
- I don't know.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.924
- Think you're old enough?
- I'm 11.

02:35.240 --> 02:36.844
I was 12 when I shot my first gun.

02:37.040 --> 02:38.326
Dad, I can do it.

02:38.720 --> 02:41.007
- You think so?
- Yeah.

02:43.040 --> 02:44.804
All right. Okay.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.002
Let's go find ourselves a deer. Come on.

02:54.680 --> 02:57.809
So the trick is,
never take your eye off the target.

02:59.360 --> 03:01.010
Got that?

03:01.840 --> 03:04.207
Jacob?

03:06.560 --> 03:08.005
Jacob?

03:11.120 --> 03:12.360
Jacob!

03:13.200 --> 03:14.440
Jacob!

03:14.880 --> 03:17.406
Jacob!
Jacob!

03:17.600 --> 03:18.601
(GASPS)

03:18.840 --> 03:21.844
- Hey, it's just me.
- Hey.

03:22.040 --> 03:23.849
- Who's Jacob?
- Who?

03:24.040 --> 03:26.042
Jacob. You were yelling his name.

03:26.280 --> 03:27.486
Oh. Um...

03:27.720 --> 03:29.324
Must've been a bad dream.

03:29.560 --> 03:32.530
Hmm. Probably 'cause you're
sleeping on the couch, silly.

03:32.720 --> 03:33.767
What are you doing down here?

03:33.960 --> 03:36.042
That would be my fault.

03:36.720 --> 03:39.644
I, I just wanted to let you know
I used the last of the shampoo.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.361
Valerie, I didn't know
that you were staying here.

03:42.560 --> 03:46.406
Stayed. Past tense. Um, just one night.

03:46.840 --> 03:48.205
(CLEARS TH ROAT)

03:48.600 --> 03:51.080
- I should go put some clothes on.
- Yeah. You do that.

03:51.480 --> 03:53.164
- All right.
- Okay.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.131
- Explain.
- Okay.

03:55.760 --> 03:57.922
Lily wants to raise Julian from the dead.

03:58.120 --> 04:00.885
Valerie tried to scorch his body
before she can get her hands on him.

04:01.080 --> 04:02.923
And that did not work out so well.

04:03.120 --> 04:05.168
Not following how that's our problem.

04:05.360 --> 04:09.445
Okay. If and when Lily welcomes Julian
back into his body,

04:09.680 --> 04:12.365
he will find out what Valerie did
and he'll come after her.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.082
Yeah, just not connecting those dots.
(CHUCKLES)

04:16.279 --> 04:20.444
Well, then maybe, you can just trust me
that I know what I'm doing. (CHUCKLES)

04:20.839 --> 04:22.079
(SIGHS)

04:24.480 --> 04:26.562
So, what you're saying is

04:26.760 --> 04:28.444
Valerie needs to disappear.

04:28.680 --> 04:32.526
New name, new job,
a country in a separate hemisphere.

04:32.720 --> 04:33.846
No. No.

04:34.080 --> 04:35.445
What? You just said that she's in danger.

04:35.640 --> 04:39.326
I mean, if I need to drive her
to the airport myself,

04:39.520 --> 04:41.329
-you know, I will do that.
- Mmm-hmm.

04:41.520 --> 04:43.807
Unless you have a problem with that.

04:44.360 --> 04:48.684
You know, l...
I really like this form of manipulation.

(CAROLINE GIGGLES)

(VALERIE CLEARS THROAT)

04:58.640 --> 05:00.961
Whatever we're doing,
we should do it fast.

05:01.320 --> 05:02.890
The Phoenix Stone turns people mad

05:03.080 --> 05:05.367
and Julian's soul's been in it
for over 100 years.

05:05.560 --> 05:09.326
So, anywhere he is,
I need to be as far away as possible.

05:09.560 --> 05:10.800
(GRUNTING)

05:11.840 --> 05:14.161
See, Beau, fencing's got a flow.

05:15.600 --> 05:18.888
Like a conversation. I speak. You listen.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.004
I speak some more.

05:23.160 --> 05:25.481
You've improved. Well done, friend.

05:35.560 --> 05:38.450
Gentlemen, the backyard's not big enough?

05:40.360 --> 05:42.966
Beau insisted. Didn't you, friend?
(CHUCKLES)

05:44.920 --> 05:46.331
Take it outside, please.

05:46.520 --> 05:49.364
Well, you heard
this ridiculously attractive woman.

05:51.200 --> 05:53.680
You are suspiciously cheery.

05:54.200 --> 05:55.804
Are you sure
you shouldn't still be in bed?

05:56.040 --> 05:57.769
My love, I need to be on my feet again.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.207
I've spent the last 100 years on my back.

06:01.000 --> 06:05.562
So unless you can make an offer
that I cannot refuse...

06:11.920 --> 06:13.160
Okay.

06:14.040 --> 06:17.567
Tempting. (CHUCKLES)
But I have another idea.

06:17.760 --> 06:19.683
I don't like it already.

06:19.920 --> 06:21.160

That name is not be uttered in this house.

06:26.560 --> 06:29.609
I am referring to my sons.

06:31.040 --> 06:32.883
Your sons are alive?

06:34.280 --> 06:37.090
Okay. (CHUCKLES)
I have some catching up to do.

07:17.120 --> 07:19.691
Remember when we used an ancient relic
to raise your wife from the dead

07:19.880 --> 07:21.769
and ended up imbuing her
with someone else's soul?

07:22.000 --> 07:23.365
Why are you calling me?

07:23.560 --> 07:25.210
(CHUCKLES) 'Cause I'm at Scull Bar,

07:25.400 --> 07:27.641
where Faux-Jo is currently holding
her laptop like it's a book.

07:27.880 --> 07:29.609
You promised me
you would help her figure out who she was

07:29.840 --> 07:31.080
before she did anything crazy.

07:31.280 --> 07:33.931
Yeah, and every time I look into her eyes
I see my murdered wife.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.804
So, I'm taking a break.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.606
I know this is probably impossible
for you.

We have no idea
what's gonna happen to her.

07:40.800 --> 07:42.245
We can't just leave her unattended.

- Well, just keep an eye on her then.
- I can't.

07:44.400 --> 07:45.481
I have to go to Mystic Falls.

is having some peace party mixer

So get here, now.

07:53.480 --> 07:56.848
Preferably before someone asks Jo
to perform surgery. Okay?

08:06.840 --> 08:08.888
Ha! Going no-tie?
I'm going no-tie.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.764
Notjust no-tie. No going.

08:10.960 --> 08:12.769
You saw her invite.
Julian's back. You're going.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.804
To watch Lily bat her eyes
at her zombie douche-brain boy-toy?

08:16.000 --> 08:19.163
Thanks, but I'd rather stay home
and stub my toe repeatedly.

08:19.360 --> 08:22.648
You do realize that zombie douche-brain
boy-toy is living in your house,

08:22.840 --> 08:25.650
bathing in your tub,
eating your Froot Loops?

08:25.840 --> 08:28.571
Oh, I know. I also know
that he's the love of Mom's life.

08:28.760 --> 08:31.650
Morn, who convinced Kai
to link Elena's life with Bonnie's

08:31.840 --> 08:34.446

for the next six-plus decades.

- Julian makes her happy, Stefan.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.404
More time they spend together,
the happier she gets,

08:38.600 --> 08:41.729
the more tragic it'll be in six months
when I hand deliver his heart to her.

Six months?

Let her start planning their entire
eternity and then squish. He's dead.

is way too traceable.

like I'm a wounded bird,

09:47.760 --> 09:50.730
like I'm some sort of victim, but I'm not.

09:50.920 --> 09:53.400
Once Stefan kills Julian,
he can't hurt anyone else.

this whole mess behind me.

You know, the whole reason

10:04.440 --> 10:06.169
Stefan must've told you.

He promised me he wouldn't tell anyone,

10:09.920 --> 10:12.651
but I didn't know that that included you.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.962
Well, his loyalty certainly is attractive,
isn't it?

10:15.160 --> 10:17.288
Okay. I'm sorry. What didn't he tell me?

10:17.480 --> 10:19.562
Never mind. As you were saying,

Matilda Pettigrew from Liverpool.
Hmm. It's good. I like it.

10:26.280 --> 10:29.363
So, you just line up
those matching pieces of candy...

10:29.600 --> 10:32.080
Like so. There you go! You got it.

10:32.280 --> 10:34.601
It took Mary Louise a month
to pass the first level.

And this is meant to be, like, fun, right?

10:37.480 --> 10:41.246
Oh, yeah! Give it another five minutes.
You'll be full-on addicted.

10:41.440 --> 10:44.330
I think this era suits you, Nora.

She doesn't want
another Valerie on her hands.

No, you certainly are not.

11:06.160 --> 11:07.685
Perhaps I could talk to Lily?

11:07.880 --> 11:10.804
See if I can't convince her
to loosen her reins a little?

11:11.000 --> 11:12.206
You would do that?

11:12.440 --> 11:13.851
Of course.

11:14.360 --> 11:17.091
There you are. The guests are arriving.

11:17.320 --> 11:18.367
Help me greet them.

11:18.560 --> 11:20.289
You're greeting them dressed like that?

11:21.320 --> 11:24.608
- What's wrong with it?
- Absolutely nothing, Mary Louise.

11:24.880 --> 11:26.848
You look stunning as always.

11:36.520 --> 11:39.649
Am I allowed in or does your
cleaning lady need to invite me?

11:39.880 --> 11:43.282
We had her sign the house over to us.
She was too expensive.

11:43.480 --> 11:45.289
- Come in.
- Thank you.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.365
Compliments of the Lockwood cellar.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.409
Oh, thank you.

11:51.360 --> 11:53.283
Ooh. Where did all these people come from?

11:53.520 --> 11:57.206
Neighboring towns. We promised them
a night of drink and conversation.

11:57.440 --> 11:59.124
Oh. So you compelled them.

12:00.080 --> 12:01.650
I wanted to show you
what peace looks like.

12:01.840 --> 12:04.810
My family is civilized.
None of these people are in danger.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.367
What, no tie?

12:07.560 --> 12:08.686
What're you doing here?

12:08.880 --> 12:10.211
I missed my stash.

12:10.400 --> 12:13.244
Boys, why don't you go mingle.
I'll put this away.

12:15.720 --> 12:19.406
-(GRUNTS)
- Tell me that you are here to help me.

12:19.720 --> 12:22.610
You know how you wanted to,
uh, redecorate.

12:22.840 --> 12:24.080
STEFAN: Mmm-hmm.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.729
- Can't let you do that.
- Why the hell not?

12:26.920 --> 12:29.161
Because Lilyjust
rearranged the furniture.

12:29.360 --> 12:30.725
And she needs a little time to live in it.

12:30.920 --> 12:32.888
You know, fall in love with the whole
feng shui of it all.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.809
Yeah. Let me guess. For six months.

12:35.240 --> 12:38.562
Okay, I give up. What am I missing here?
Why do you care so much?

12:38.760 --> 12:41.809
Let's just say that the furniture
Lily recently purchased

12:42.000 --> 12:45.243
is psychotic and needs to be disposed
of immediately.

12:45.600 --> 12:48.444
Gentlemen, welcome.

12:48.960 --> 12:51.611
- Hmm. I'm Julian.
- I'm Damon.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.086
Lily told me all about you.

12:53.280 --> 12:58.605
Of course, you were only a boy back then
and now, you're, well, you.

12:58.840 --> 13:00.569
Stefan, how long has it been?

13:00.800 --> 13:03.804
I don't know. I must've lost track
after I stopped thinking about you.

13:04.040 --> 13:07.328

You must be dreadfully sober.

13:07.520 --> 13:11.127

something to drink, will you?

13:16.960 --> 13:18.928
Deputy Donovan, welcome.

13:19.120 --> 13:20.724
It's Matt. We lost all formalities

13:20.920 --> 13:23.207
when you and your girlfriend
nearly drained me of all my blood.

13:24.240 --> 13:28.802
Okay, look, the whole point of this
shindig is to start over. So...

13:29.000 --> 13:32.243
Got a better idea. Why don't you convince
your family to leave Mystic Falls?

13:32.440 --> 13:33.601
And Why would I do that?

13:33.800 --> 13:38.567
Why would a group of vampires hang around
an abandoned town with nothing to eat?

13:38.960 --> 13:40.291
MARY: What are we talking about?

13:40.480 --> 13:42.084
Apparently Matt is sick of us.

13:42.280 --> 13:45.409
I just want my town back,
preferably before anyone else dies.

13:45.880 --> 13:49.521
Look around. Look at all these people.
They're still alive, aren't they?

13:49.760 --> 13:51.171
At least till the dessert course.

13:52.560 --> 13:53.800
You're making it worse.

13:55.160 --> 13:57.481
Come on, let's go meet people.

14:06.840 --> 14:10.003
Oh. Did whatever animal they're serving
for dinner get a plus one?

14:10.240 --> 14:12.083
Hilarious. I was invited.

14:12.280 --> 14:13.805
Scoping the competition?

14:14.040 --> 14:16.202
There's no competition to scope.

you're my date.

14:23.800 --> 14:25.325
Sorry?

14:26.760 --> 14:28.922
Lorenzo, I'm so glad you came.

14:30.400 --> 14:31.731
Wouldn't miss it.

14:34.600 --> 14:37.490
Bonnie, I know we've had a rocky past.

14:37.680 --> 14:39.330
But I hope this means
you're willing to start fresh.

14:39.560 --> 14:41.688
You're the reason
I'm never gonna see my best friend again,

14:41.880 --> 14:43.962
so I hope you're joking.

14:52.720 --> 14:54.563
Hmm. Nice break.

14:54.760 --> 14:57.081
Well, it is my pool table after all.

14:58.160 --> 15:00.083
Ah. Damon, come play with us.

15:00.280 --> 15:04.285
Oh, I would, but I have an irrational fear
of pool tables.

15:04.480 --> 15:07.324
It's not irrational fear of losing?

15:08.040 --> 15:09.201
Wait. Has he never...

15:09.400 --> 15:10.925
Have you never heard the story

15:11.120 --> 15:14.044
about the guy that tries to kill
the vampire during a game of pool?

15:14.600 --> 15:18.650
(CHUCKLES) Well, considering
my body's been in stasis for a century,

15:18.840 --> 15:19.921
why don't you enlighten me?

15:20.120 --> 15:22.566
Well, there's this guy,

15:22.760 --> 15:25.604
he's about Stefan's build,
maybe a wee bit bigger,

15:25.800 --> 15:27.643
a little more chiseled,
less height on the hair--

15:27.840 --> 15:29.080
Get on with the story.

15:29.440 --> 15:31.727
Right.
So this vampire that he wants to kill

15:31.920 --> 15:34.400
is at least 300 years older than him.

15:34.600 --> 15:39.083
And anyone and everyone with half a brain
knew he was being an idiot,

15:39.280 --> 15:42.682
but he had this inexplicable obsession.

15:43.960 --> 15:46.008
So he bets the vampire on a game of pool.

15:46.200 --> 15:49.283
And just as the vamp
is setting up for his last shot...

15:55.200 --> 15:56.531
- And?
- Never got a chance.

15:56.920 --> 15:58.365
- Oh.
- DAMON: Yeah.

15:58.600 --> 16:01.285
Another vampire comes out of nowhere
and stops him.

16:01.520 --> 16:03.807
Like I said, he was being an idiot.

16:04.120 --> 16:08.091

I have a form of retrograde amnesia.

might have affected my head a bit.

of course, but, um...

18:42.280 --> 18:45.124
There is a little something
that would bring me great relief.

18:46.400 --> 18:48.767
Our dearly departed Oscar
had something of mine,

18:48.960 --> 18:50.769
but it wasn't on him when he died

18:50.960 --> 18:54.646
so I thought,
perhaps it was in his automobile.

18:54.920 --> 18:58.322
Could you, maybe,
figure out where it was sent?

and then he lost the plot. Jo is a human.

all you have done is tried to strip me
of my happiness.
