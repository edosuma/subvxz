I love my idea.

09:53.810 --> 09:55.116
I'll write up
some talking points.

09:55.159 --> 09:56.030
BLAKE: Ma'am, we just
received word from FBI.

09:56.073 --> 09:57.684
They have unlocked the messages

09:57.727 --> 09:59.686
between Starowolski
and Nathan Cleminger.

09:59.729 --> 10:00.861
We'll get
the full report momentarily.

10:00.904 --> 10:02.776
Right now, they're saying
they have enough

10:02.819 --> 10:04.255
to charge Starowolski
with conspiracy.

10:04.299 --> 10:07.258
Good. Okay, so we've got Demko
the evidence he needed.

10:07.302 --> 10:09.347
I still want to go to the EUMATT: Not taking any chances?

10:09.391 --> 10:11.785
Well, if we can't get
Starowolski to talk,

10:11.828 --> 10:13.438
the next step is violating

10:13.482 --> 10:15.049
Nathan Cleminger's
constitutional rights.

10:15.092 --> 10:18.443
So, no, I don't want
to take any chances.

10:18.487 --> 10:19.836
There's nothing violent

10:19.880 --> 10:22.883
about standing up
to defend your culture.

10:22.926 --> 10:25.668
INTERROGATOR: Who specifically
is threatening white culture?

10:25.712 --> 10:26.800
NATHAN:
The whole system.

10:26.843 --> 10:28.889
So the U.S. government?

10:28.932 --> 10:33.763
NATHAN: Anyone spouting
this liberal fantasy about

10:33.807 --> 10:35.722
diversity and multiculturalism.

10:35.765 --> 10:37.201
[knock on door,
door opens]

10:37.245 --> 10:38.507
HENRY:
Hi, Russell.

10:38.550 --> 10:40.814
So, FBI counterterrorism
did the interrogation

10:40.857 --> 10:43.077
on Nathan Cleminger, right?Yeah. Why?

10:43.120 --> 10:44.208
Well, they tipped it.

10:44.252 --> 10:46.254
He didn't say anything
about targeting

10:46.297 --> 10:48.082
the federal government
until they introduced it.

10:48.125 --> 10:51.607
His group launched
an RPG at the White House.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.305
Seems safe to assume they're
targeting the U.S. government.

10:54.349 --> 10:57.526
Or an administration
he sees as betraying

10:57.569 --> 10:59.223
our founding principles.

10:59.267 --> 11:01.399
Now I don't know if he
sees himself as a patriot

11:01.443 --> 11:03.532
trying to save the foundation
of our government,

11:03.575 --> 11:05.882
or an anarchist
trying to destroy it.

11:05.926 --> 11:09.799
I got nothing
to tell you. Sorry.

11:09.843 --> 11:12.802
What if you questioned
the kid yourself?

11:15.762 --> 11:19.156
We're not gonna need
press archives, right?

11:19.200 --> 11:22.246
I don't know.

11:22.290 --> 11:23.987
Maybe just this year's.

11:24.031 --> 11:27.730
Thanks.
You okay?

11:27.774 --> 11:29.645
Yeah.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.603
I should be asking you.

11:31.647 --> 11:33.388
How are you doing?Oh, you know.

11:33.431 --> 11:34.998
Just slap some drywall up,

11:35.042 --> 11:36.913
paint a nice coat
of denial on everything.

11:36.957 --> 11:38.872
Good to go.

11:38.915 --> 11:42.136
The one time I manage to
steal a few vacation days.

11:42.179 --> 11:45.530
Just be glad that
you weren't here.

11:45.574 --> 11:47.968
Seriously.

11:50.013 --> 11:52.015
[power saw grinding nearby]

11:53.800 --> 11:55.932
You know what,
I think, uh...

11:55.976 --> 11:57.804
I think we both need
to get out of here.

11:57.847 --> 11:59.283
Boba tea run?

11:59.327 --> 12:01.982
I need to finish up.

12:02.025 --> 12:04.114
Well, can I at least
get you something?

12:04.158 --> 12:06.334
Maybe a double espresso.

12:06.377 --> 12:08.640
Yes.

12:08.684 --> 12:09.859
[whispers]:
Hooah.

12:09.903 --> 12:12.470
Given the evidence
of tactical and financial

12:12.514 --> 12:17.214
support clearly provided
to the Aryan Popular Force,

12:17.258 --> 12:20.174
I hope you'll now agree
to surrender

12:20.217 --> 12:22.219
Alek Starowolski
for questioning.

12:22.263 --> 12:25.657
DEMKO: It's, uh,
very disturbing evidence,

12:25.701 --> 12:27.181
and once charges have
been filed,

12:27.224 --> 12:28.922
I will pass on the request
for consideration.

12:28.965 --> 12:31.489
It's an informal questioning,
Mr. President.

12:31.533 --> 12:33.230
I'm afraid we must
follow protocol.

12:33.274 --> 12:34.231
It's a sensitive matter.

12:34.275 --> 12:36.277
You know what's sensitive?

12:36.320 --> 12:40.716
Your member of Parliament using
his own shipping company

12:40.760 --> 12:45.025
to send an RPG that was used
to hit the White House.

12:45.068 --> 12:46.504
There is mention of this.

12:46.548 --> 12:49.856
If we had proof that these
materials were received...

12:49.899 --> 12:51.945
I want you to consider
your next words carefully,

12:51.988 --> 12:53.903
because right now, your country
is at a crossroads.

12:53.947 --> 12:57.385
Will you or will you not
recognize

12:57.428 --> 12:59.517
the collusion
of your own citizen

12:59.561 --> 13:00.518
with an attack

13:00.562 --> 13:01.998
on the United States?

13:02.042 --> 13:04.435
It is, in fact, your country
that is at a crossroads,

13:04.479 --> 13:05.785
Madam Secretary.

13:05.828 --> 13:07.351
If you and the EU

13:07.395 --> 13:11.007
force me to surrender
Alek Starowolski,

13:11.051 --> 13:12.879
it will no longer be me
talking to you

13:12.922 --> 13:14.837
as the leader of Poland.

13:14.881 --> 13:17.579
And believe me, you will not
like my replacement.

13:17.622 --> 13:19.146
Do you understand?

13:19.189 --> 13:21.496
I'm begging you to...

13:21.539 --> 13:23.977
to proceed carefully.

13:24.020 --> 13:28.068
Tell me what you mean
by "proceed carefully."

13:28.111 --> 13:30.722
What President Demko
was asking for--

13:30.766 --> 13:33.290
and he was pretty persuasive--

13:33.334 --> 13:35.336
is enough time to build
a coalition

13:35.379 --> 13:37.425
of the more centrist
members of his parliament

13:37.468 --> 13:39.906
before handing over
Starowolski.

13:39.949 --> 13:43.648
Now, he also agreed to
freeze Starowolski's assets

13:43.692 --> 13:47.435
and give us full access
to his financial records

13:47.478 --> 13:49.524
for investigation.

13:51.134 --> 13:54.834
Thank you, Elizabeth.
You've done what you could.

13:54.877 --> 13:57.619
Ephraim, send word to FBI.

13:57.662 --> 14:00.317
It's time to deploy a team and
bring this guy in ourselves.

14:00.361 --> 14:02.842
Wait, Mr. President,
I strongly advise

14:02.885 --> 14:06.976
against violating the
sovereignty of a NATO ally.

14:07.020 --> 14:08.935
Given the volatility of the
political landscape in...

14:08.978 --> 14:12.025
The American people are
waiting for another attack.

14:12.068 --> 14:14.679
They deserve justice
and security,

14:14.723 --> 14:16.551
and they shouldn't have to
wait around for a NATO ally

14:16.594 --> 14:17.552
to give it to them.

14:17.595 --> 14:19.249
Understood.

14:19.293 --> 14:23.384
But Demko fears Starowolski's
surrender could... unleash chaos

14:23.427 --> 14:26.822
and topple his government.

14:26.866 --> 14:29.738
And if Poland falls, NATO
may not be far behind.

14:33.133 --> 14:37.050
Ephraim, wheels up
in 24 hours.

14:37.093 --> 14:40.096
If Demko thinks his head
is on the line,

14:40.140 --> 14:43.143
he'll push harder
to find a way out.Yes, sir.

14:44.971 --> 14:45.972
Thank you, sir.

14:51.978 --> 14:53.893
These Starowolski banking
records are killing me.

14:53.936 --> 14:55.895
How far are you?

14:55.938 --> 14:58.462
Stuck in 2004.

14:58.506 --> 15:01.944
Is it me,
or are they just burying us

15:01.988 --> 15:03.641
in too much information?

15:03.685 --> 15:06.514
I asked forensics accounting
for a summary, and basically,

15:06.557 --> 15:09.865
nobody can figure out
where his money is.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.346
He had plenty in 2004.

15:12.389 --> 15:14.217
Oh, no, here,
just take mine.

15:14.261 --> 15:17.568
I'm switching
to baby carrots.

15:17.612 --> 15:21.790
You know they're not
actual baby carrots.

15:21.833 --> 15:26.708
So Starowolski was in debt
for the past five years?

15:26.751 --> 15:28.188
Yeah, the whole time
he was living like

15:28.231 --> 15:30.625
he was in a rap video.

15:30.668 --> 15:33.410
What about the shipping company
that he used to send the RPG?

15:33.454 --> 15:34.542
Where are the files
on that?

15:34.585 --> 15:36.283
I asked forensics
to track it.

15:36.326 --> 15:37.588
How much time before
they launch the raid?

15:37.632 --> 15:40.722
About 20 hours by now.

15:40.765 --> 15:42.550
What do you mean
they're not baby carrots?

15:42.593 --> 15:45.031
They cut them into shape.

15:45.074 --> 15:46.815
Well, how does everybody
not know that?

15:46.858 --> 15:48.556
There you are.
Henry just called.

15:48.599 --> 15:51.211
Stevie's in the emergency room
at St. Lucius.

15:51.254 --> 15:53.691
What? Oh, my God.
What happened?He doesn't know.

15:53.735 --> 15:55.128
He's on his way there,
but your car is ready.

15:55.171 --> 15:56.999
I'll keep looking
at the shipping company.

15:57.043 --> 15:58.435
Okay, thank you, Doctor.

15:58.479 --> 16:00.176
Yes, I will.
Yeah. Bye.

16:00.220 --> 16:02.396
She's fine, she's fine.What happened?

16:02.439 --> 16:03.919
She just--
She got dehydrated

16:03.963 --> 16:05.921
and passed out while she was
out getting boba.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.444
She just whacked her elbow.Can we see her?

16:07.488 --> 16:08.576
She's sleeping; they want
to keep her overnight.

16:08.619 --> 16:10.491
But she's gonna be fine.

16:10.534 --> 16:11.883
Why was she the one
out getting boba?

16:11.927 --> 16:13.320
I didn't know
she even liked boba.

16:13.363 --> 16:15.670
It's like drinking
and chewing at the same time.

16:15.713 --> 16:17.106
Yeah.

16:17.150 --> 16:20.066
Anyway, that was
Dr. Delgado.

16:20.109 --> 16:23.286
He was surprised that
she was even at work.

16:23.330 --> 16:24.287
Oh.

16:24.331 --> 16:28.030
Okay, I may--

16:28.074 --> 16:31.947
I-I-I'm gonna have
to go back in a minute.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.644
We're trying everything
we can think of

16:33.688 --> 16:36.125
to get Poland to
hand over their guy

16:36.169 --> 16:38.823
before FBI goes in
and grabs him.

16:38.867 --> 16:41.522
Well, it would help
if that APF kid

16:41.565 --> 16:43.698
they have in detention
would talk.

16:43.741 --> 16:45.004
Yeah, that would help.

16:45.047 --> 16:47.745
Russell even asked
if I would be willing

16:47.789 --> 16:48.964
to question the kid myself.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.314
What?

16:51.358 --> 16:52.663
They want an ethics report
on whether or not

16:52.707 --> 16:54.143
they can hold him
as an enemy combatant.

16:54.187 --> 16:57.929
Oh, God, they are all-in
on that strategy.

16:57.973 --> 16:59.496
Well, you're not
considering it, are you?

16:59.540 --> 17:03.152
Well, I have experience
with the Christian militia.

17:03.196 --> 17:05.676
You also have a daughter
who's in the hospital

17:05.720 --> 17:07.722
because of him.
Look,

17:07.765 --> 17:11.508
we don't know that he was
directly involved in the attack.

17:11.552 --> 17:13.945
We don't know where they are,
how many they are,

17:13.989 --> 17:15.382
what they're planning...

17:15.425 --> 17:19.560
And we have an entire team
looking into it, so...

17:19.603 --> 17:21.083
[cell phone ringing]

17:21.127 --> 17:24.086
Oh, wait, I got to,
I got to take this.

17:25.740 --> 17:27.655
Yeah, Jay?

17:29.135 --> 17:31.267
Oh, that is huge.

17:31.311 --> 17:32.268
Um, I'm--

17:32.312 --> 17:33.530
No, no, she's fine.

17:33.574 --> 17:35.619
She was just
a little dehydrated.

17:35.663 --> 17:37.926
Okay, I'm on my way.

17:40.624 --> 17:43.323
They've had a breakthrough.

17:43.366 --> 17:45.716
I've-I...
Of course.

17:45.760 --> 17:46.848
Go.
Bye.

17:55.204 --> 17:59.295
So the whole time Starowolski's
been out there railing

17:59.339 --> 18:03.299
against the great Russia threat
to Polish independence,

18:03.343 --> 18:05.693
he's been on
the Russian payroll?

18:05.736 --> 18:07.173
Pretty much.

18:07.216 --> 18:08.696
Russia does know how
to play a deep game.

18:08.739 --> 18:12.700
ELIZABETH: The Russian part,
that doesn't surprise me.

18:15.181 --> 18:18.358
Alek Starowolski,
leader of a metal band,

18:18.401 --> 18:19.794
rises to Parliament.

18:19.837 --> 18:24.233
An ego like that, letting
himself be bought out?

18:24.277 --> 18:26.583
That's surprising.Especially knowing
the whole time

18:26.627 --> 18:29.717
this could bring a mob
to his door if it ever got out.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.284
This was taken
at a far-right rally

18:31.327 --> 18:34.025
in Warsaw this spring.

18:34.069 --> 18:35.810
Nazi imagery is
restricted in Poland,

18:35.853 --> 18:38.334
so this is what
they're using instead.

18:38.378 --> 18:40.728
ELIZABETH:
A U.S. Confederate flag?

18:40.771 --> 18:42.382
My God.

18:43.644 --> 18:47.691
What if this is Russia
using our own history

18:47.735 --> 18:50.172
to drum up some kind
of global conspiracy

18:50.216 --> 18:51.826
of far-right lunacy against us?

18:51.869 --> 18:54.176
Okay, but there's
nothing here to suggest

18:54.220 --> 18:56.222
Russia knowingly funded
the attack on the White House.

18:56.265 --> 18:58.267
There's nothing to say
they didn't.

18:58.311 --> 19:00.704
Jay's right.
If Russia's masterminding

19:00.748 --> 19:03.794
this whole thing,
then this brush fire with Poland

19:03.838 --> 19:06.145
just became a...
a raging forest fire.

19:06.188 --> 19:10.149
Unless the Russian connection
gives us a way to contain it.

19:10.192 --> 19:13.152
Mr. President, our intelligence
has connected

19:13.195 --> 19:16.633
revenue streams in Alek
Starowolski's financial records

19:16.677 --> 19:20.246
to a Russian source,
Yevgeny Uslovsky.

19:20.289 --> 19:23.727
Streams? You mean connections.
What connections?

19:23.771 --> 19:26.817
A range of business dealings,
personal investments...

19:26.861 --> 19:29.037
It's quite extensive.

19:29.080 --> 19:30.647
And it's been going on
for some time.

19:30.691 --> 19:32.258
ELIZABETH:
We'll send you the full report.

19:35.652 --> 19:37.567
ELIZABETH:
While this is obviously
upsetting,

19:37.611 --> 19:42.311
it may also provide you
a way out of your predicament.

19:42.355 --> 19:45.749
You now have the means
to expose Alek Starowolski

19:45.793 --> 19:46.924
as a secret operative,

19:46.968 --> 19:50.928
and hand him over to us
without any risk

19:50.972 --> 19:52.843
of provoking his supporters.

19:52.887 --> 19:55.759
And in the meantime,
solidify your own position.

19:55.803 --> 19:58.458
With your cooperation,
Mr. President,

19:58.501 --> 20:00.547
we'd like to send in
a hostage rescue team

20:00.590 --> 20:04.551
to render Starowolski
to our borders, in, say...

20:04.594 --> 20:06.814
There's a tactical air base
in Lask, two hours at the most.

20:06.857 --> 20:10.383
Two hours.
Would that suit you, Jozef?

20:10.426 --> 20:11.906
I will reach out
to the prime minister.

20:11.949 --> 20:14.865
I think he would agree
it's best if we coordinate

20:14.909 --> 20:18.782
the-the rendition with Agencja
Bezpieczenstwa Wewnetrznego.

20:18.826 --> 20:20.784
That should be acceptable.

20:20.828 --> 20:22.395
DEMKO:
But I must insist

20:22.438 --> 20:25.789
we follow a strict blackout
on Starowolski's affiliations

20:25.833 --> 20:28.357
until after he is in custody.

20:28.401 --> 20:30.141
Of course.

20:30.185 --> 20:31.534
Send me the report,
I will follow up.

20:31.578 --> 20:34.233
Uh... thank you.

20:36.147 --> 20:37.279
DAISY: That didn't
seem like a guy

20:37.323 --> 20:38.759
who drew a "get out
of jail free" card.

20:38.802 --> 20:40.282
MATT: I don't get it.
Why don't we just

20:40.326 --> 20:41.936
expose this guy
as a Russian stooge?

20:41.979 --> 20:43.198
I mean, isn't that
the whole point?

20:43.242 --> 20:45.722
Too chaotic.

20:45.766 --> 20:49.204
Demko's afraid Russia will
somehow turn this around on him.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.424
Which brings up
the next question.

20:51.467 --> 20:54.209
How do we confront Russia
about their role in this?

20:54.253 --> 20:55.863
[sighs]

20:55.906 --> 20:58.779
Carefully.

20:58.822 --> 21:01.303
Reach out to Foreign Minister
Avdonin tomorrow.

21:01.347 --> 21:02.739
Okay?
Okay.

21:02.783 --> 21:04.263
Thank you, everyone.MATT: Thank you, ma'am.

21:08.571 --> 21:10.269
TEAM LEADER:
Approaching location.

21:10.312 --> 21:12.575
We're keeping this under
the radar, right, Commander?

21:12.619 --> 21:13.794
Get that hallway
locked down.

21:13.837 --> 21:17.276
TEAM LEADER:
Gaining entry.

21:19.365 --> 21:21.802
Package is located.

21:23.978 --> 21:25.936
No pulse.

21:28.591 --> 21:30.550
Who knew we were coming?

21:30.593 --> 21:32.639
Russia.

21:44.738 --> 21:47.654
Okay. Thank you.Thank you.

21:47.697 --> 21:49.177
Okay, so, can you stay
for a minute?

21:49.220 --> 21:50.961
I'll make you breakfast.

21:51.005 --> 21:53.573
No, I can't.Wait, Stevie, did you not listen
to what the doctor said?

21:53.616 --> 21:54.835
Come on, I made you,
I made you sleep

21:54.878 --> 21:56.880
in a hospital waiting room.

21:56.924 --> 21:59.274
It is only fair.JACE: I would not say
no to pancakes.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.668
Are you okay?I'm fine.

22:01.711 --> 22:04.061
You guys waited up?Why is everyone making
such a big deal?

22:04.105 --> 22:07.064
'Cause you collapsed
in the street.A boba place, to be clear.

22:07.108 --> 22:08.892
Okay, come on, you guys.
Everything is okay.

22:08.936 --> 22:10.894
Go and sleep in your
beds, would you?Yeah, let's go.

22:10.938 --> 22:12.896
Come on, go.We all need some... come on.

22:12.940 --> 22:14.289
Pancakes later.I'm collecting on that.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.899
You, too. Bed, Stevie.Come on, Stevie.

22:15.943 --> 22:17.510
What? You are forgetting
that I just slept,

22:17.553 --> 22:19.903
like, nine hours straight.

22:19.947 --> 22:22.950
Well, then settle in here
and binge something boring.

22:22.993 --> 22:24.908
Russell's
panda cam or...
[chuckles]

22:24.952 --> 22:25.909
Where is she going?

22:25.953 --> 22:28.216
I am making tea.Going that way.

22:28.259 --> 22:29.565
You guys are the ones
who actually need sleep.

22:29.609 --> 22:30.784
Oh, she's right.

22:30.827 --> 22:32.960
Aren't you on, like,
your second all-nighter?

22:33.003 --> 22:35.832
[groans] This is dangerous.

22:35.876 --> 22:38.835
Come.
No, I-I can't.

22:38.879 --> 22:40.446
I got to go to the FBI.

22:40.489 --> 22:43.057
You're gonna do
the interrogation on no sleep?

22:43.100 --> 22:45.929
Neo-Nazis wait for no man.

22:45.973 --> 22:49.585
Remember, it's not your job
to crack this kid.

22:49.629 --> 22:52.719
You just figure out if it's

22:52.762 --> 22:56.026
okay to deny him
his constitutional right

22:56.070 --> 22:59.378
to due process.

22:59.421 --> 23:01.945
And then I'm just gonna
head back in a second.

23:01.989 --> 23:04.426
Just gonna...[door opens]

23:10.214 --> 23:12.869
Oh, God!

23:12.913 --> 23:13.957
What time is it?

23:14.001 --> 23:15.176
It's, like, almost 9:00.

23:15.219 --> 23:18.092
You barely slept an hour.

23:18.135 --> 23:19.789
Okay.

23:19.833 --> 23:22.749
Well, I guess I'm
gonna get back at it.

23:22.792 --> 23:25.012
I'm gonna...

23:25.055 --> 23:27.536
You know, you spent
the morning, uh, berating me

23:27.580 --> 23:30.800
for pushing myself too hard.
Just pointing that out.

23:32.802 --> 23:37.981
Well, I didn't nearly rupture
my artery last week, so...Hmm.

23:41.637 --> 23:44.379
Why did you tell us
that Dr. Delgado said

23:44.423 --> 23:45.815
you could go back to work?

23:48.818 --> 23:51.081
He didn't not say it.

23:51.125 --> 23:53.344
I don't know.

23:53.388 --> 23:55.259
I just felt like
I had to do something.

23:57.305 --> 23:58.828
Well, that went well.

23:58.872 --> 24:01.788
[chuckles]

24:01.831 --> 24:05.661
The last thing that I said
to June before the attack

24:05.705 --> 24:10.274
was that my generation
was going to be more

24:10.318 --> 24:13.234
than just servants
to powerful men.

24:13.277 --> 24:15.541
Yeah.

24:15.584 --> 24:17.499
Super bad.

24:17.543 --> 24:18.979
And then her memorial
is all about

24:19.022 --> 24:20.546
how powerful
she really was,

24:20.589 --> 24:24.941
and how she got all this stuff
done behind the scenes and...

24:24.985 --> 24:27.770
I just... I missed it.

24:27.814 --> 24:30.033
Totally missed it.

24:30.077 --> 24:33.863
Well, I think for a lot of
women in her generation...

24:36.866 --> 24:39.129
...all they could do is
work behind the scenes.

24:39.173 --> 24:42.002
Yeah. I'm still
an idiot, though.

24:42.045 --> 24:45.788
So, this was basically
the self-loathing tour?

24:45.832 --> 24:48.008
Yeah.

24:48.051 --> 24:49.792
And then I just
ended up making myself

24:49.836 --> 24:50.837
more of a burden to everyone.

24:50.880 --> 24:52.360
Would you stop it?

24:52.403 --> 24:55.537
You are not a burden

24:55.581 --> 24:57.670
because you need to
be taken care of.

24:57.713 --> 25:01.238
You're a burden because
you still live at home.

25:01.282 --> 25:02.283
[soft chuckle]

25:03.980 --> 25:07.375
If you want to make things
better for the next generation,

25:07.418 --> 25:10.465
then get rid of this whole myth
that we are supposed to be

25:10.509 --> 25:13.860
invisible and self-effacing.

25:13.903 --> 25:15.470
I don't want to be invisible.

25:15.514 --> 25:19.300
I just want to be worthy of
the people who came before me.

25:19.343 --> 25:22.346
I mean, June, the last thing
that she thought

25:22.390 --> 25:26.786
was that I was this
selfish, entitled baby.

25:26.829 --> 25:28.875
And she was right.

25:28.918 --> 25:32.705
Or she was probably thinking
you're young and driven,

25:32.748 --> 25:35.272
just like she
was at your age.

25:35.316 --> 25:39.146
Or...

25:39.189 --> 25:40.887
more likely,

25:40.930 --> 25:43.933
she was thinking about
what she wanted for dinner.

25:43.977 --> 25:47.110
So you're saying that
I'm still being self-absorbed?

25:47.154 --> 25:52.289
You managed to find another way
to beat yourself up in there.

25:52.333 --> 25:55.641
Impressive.

25:55.684 --> 25:58.426
Think you can stay here
without ending up in the ER?

25:58.469 --> 26:01.995
Yeah. [sighs]

26:02.038 --> 26:04.084
You sure you don't want in
on this panda cam?

26:04.127 --> 26:07.435
I wish I could.

26:11.874 --> 26:14.311
[lock buzzes, latch clicks]

26:14.355 --> 26:16.487
Hi, Nathan.[door shuts]

26:16.531 --> 26:17.706
I'm Henry McCord.

26:17.750 --> 26:18.925
I'm gonna be asking
you a few questions.

26:18.968 --> 26:20.274
Here's some coffee.

26:20.317 --> 26:22.058
When do I get a lawyer?

26:22.102 --> 26:25.932
Well, that's why I'm here,
to advise on your case.

26:25.975 --> 26:29.239
It would be helpful if I could
hear your side of the story.

26:29.283 --> 26:31.981
Or I can not say anything.

26:32.025 --> 26:34.027
That's certainly
within your rights.

26:34.070 --> 26:36.943
Uh... oh, you're 22. You got
a birthday coming up.

26:36.986 --> 26:38.161
Sure that'll be fun.

26:38.205 --> 26:39.685
What do you like to
do on your birthday?

26:39.728 --> 26:40.990
Not much. I don't drink.

26:41.034 --> 26:42.383
Friends drink?

26:42.426 --> 26:44.080
We grew up in the church.
We're all pretty straight.

26:44.124 --> 26:46.126
Oh, yeah. I saw your
dad's a preacher.

26:46.169 --> 26:47.388
Yeah. Step-dad.

26:47.431 --> 26:48.781
What does he think
of you working

26:48.824 --> 26:52.088
with the Aryan
Popular Force?

26:52.132 --> 26:54.221
I don't want
to answer that.

26:57.659 --> 27:00.096
I want to know
about the first time

27:00.140 --> 27:01.532
you made contact
with the APF.

27:01.576 --> 27:03.534
Can you talk about that?

27:03.578 --> 27:07.060
No.

27:07.103 --> 27:10.846
All right. Well, Nathan,
uh, if I walk out of here

27:10.890 --> 27:12.239
without a better
understanding of your story

27:12.282 --> 27:14.023
than what's in this file,

27:14.067 --> 27:16.330
things will start to go
differently for you.

27:16.373 --> 27:17.984
It won't be good.

27:18.027 --> 27:20.464
I'm here to help.

27:24.686 --> 27:26.166
I was coming out of the library.

27:26.209 --> 27:30.170
I had some new games and, um...

27:30.213 --> 27:33.042
these guys basically, uh,

27:33.086 --> 27:34.957
tackled me and beat the crap
out of me.

27:35.001 --> 27:36.872
How come?

27:36.916 --> 27:41.660
Uh, they thought
I looked gay, which I'm not.

27:41.703 --> 27:44.445
Hmm. Okay. What else?

27:44.488 --> 27:48.667
There was this one guy--
not gonna say his name--

27:48.710 --> 27:52.627
he took my games and said that's
how they made me compliant.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.411
And he asked if
I could handle the truth.

27:54.455 --> 27:56.239
What truth?

27:56.283 --> 27:58.894
How popular culture keeps
the warrior class down.

27:58.938 --> 28:02.681
Are you part of
the warrior class?

28:02.724 --> 28:04.117
Of course. So are you.

28:04.160 --> 28:06.032
We're the soldiers of Odin.

28:06.075 --> 28:08.382
Nordic warriors.
It's in our blood.

28:08.425 --> 28:11.341
What's in our blood?

28:11.385 --> 28:14.344
The will to build
empires, man.

28:14.388 --> 28:16.695
I mean, this language
we're speaking, this, uh,

28:16.738 --> 28:17.913
this building
that we're sitting in,

28:17.957 --> 28:20.220
this entire country,

28:20.263 --> 28:22.048
every-every major achievement
of the Western world,

28:22.091 --> 28:24.877
we built it. It's ours.

28:24.920 --> 28:26.617
So, North America, Europe...

28:26.661 --> 28:28.054
Everywhere that's
technologically advanced.

28:28.097 --> 28:29.533
All the good countries.

28:29.577 --> 28:30.970
Oh, what about Asia?

28:31.013 --> 28:33.276
IQ tests are higher for people
of European descent.

28:33.320 --> 28:35.757
That's just a fact, man.

28:35.801 --> 28:37.367
I know the liberals
want to pretend

28:37.411 --> 28:39.761
like we're all one happy family,
but it's not true.

28:39.805 --> 28:40.893
Some people are smarter.

28:40.936 --> 28:42.546
That's why
we're the ruling class.

28:42.590 --> 28:45.071
If white America
is the ruling class,

28:45.114 --> 28:47.551
then why attack
the White House?

28:47.595 --> 28:49.379
I wasn't a part of that.

28:49.423 --> 28:54.036
What did the Aryan Popular
Force hope to achieve?

28:54.080 --> 28:56.343
Ultimately, RaHoWa,
racial holy war.

28:56.386 --> 28:58.301
That's the great cleanse.

28:58.345 --> 29:00.956
I probably won't be
around for that.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.305
All we're trying to do now

29:02.349 --> 29:05.918
is just stand up for our people,
our culture.

29:05.961 --> 29:07.658
You feel that your culture
is threatened?

29:07.702 --> 29:08.877
Every day.

29:08.921 --> 29:11.097
Every minute.
Multiculturalism

29:11.140 --> 29:14.274
is a travesty
whose entire aim

29:14.317 --> 29:20.019
is to eradicate my culture,
my people, my history.

29:20.062 --> 29:24.153
And we'll rise up against
any-any person or institution

29:24.197 --> 29:25.415
that threatens our dominion.

29:25.459 --> 29:27.330
Including the U.S. government?

29:27.374 --> 29:29.898
If it fails to protect our
security and our borders, yeah.

29:29.942 --> 29:32.596
That's in the Declaration
of Independence, man.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.337
It's the duty of people
to rise up.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.733
So, would you call yourself
a revolutionary?

29:38.777 --> 29:40.779
Your word, not mine.

29:40.822 --> 29:43.912
Okay. I want to talk
about Alek Starowolski.

29:43.956 --> 29:45.522
I don't have anything
to say on that subject.

29:45.566 --> 29:47.698
Was he an important ally?

29:47.742 --> 29:49.744
[sighs]

29:53.226 --> 29:55.881
So, that's it?

29:55.924 --> 29:57.317
You don't want
me to help you?

29:57.360 --> 30:01.147
Hmm. What about,
what about Toby?

30:01.190 --> 30:03.802
What is he gonna think when he
finds out that his big brother

30:03.845 --> 30:05.194
is responsible for the
deaths of three people?

30:05.238 --> 30:06.543
I wasn't part
of that action.

30:06.587 --> 30:10.809
[scoffs] That's not what
the press is gonna say.

30:10.852 --> 30:14.595
You think you can
manipulate me like that?

30:14.638 --> 30:17.990
You're a discredit to your race.

30:18.033 --> 30:20.122
Okay. [clears throat]

30:20.166 --> 30:21.297
You know what? I could,

30:21.341 --> 30:23.386
I could refute every
point you just made.

30:23.430 --> 30:27.695
I could talk about how
agriculture, our first cities,

30:27.738 --> 30:29.175
all come from Mesopotamia
in the Middle East,

30:29.218 --> 30:31.090
centuries before Europe
was civilized,

30:31.133 --> 30:33.483
about how they gave
us symbolic language,

30:33.527 --> 30:36.269
like your swastika tattoo,

30:36.312 --> 30:37.923
which, by the way,
is backwards.

30:37.966 --> 30:40.403
I could talk about the IQ stuff
that you read on the Internet,

30:40.447 --> 30:42.797
which is biased nonsense

30:42.841 --> 30:45.017
and has been proven wrong
many, many times.

30:45.060 --> 30:46.279
But you know what?
I'm not gonna do that.

30:46.322 --> 30:49.195
Instead, I'm-I'm gonna
read you something.

30:49.238 --> 30:53.286
"After opening its borders
to the West in 1853,

30:53.329 --> 30:56.028
"Japanese woodblock prints
exerted a key influence

30:56.071 --> 30:59.031
"on the works of
French Impressionism,

30:59.074 --> 31:02.034
"seen in van Gogh's
rich and joyful color,

31:02.077 --> 31:05.211
"Cézanne's stark composition
and Monet's contemplative

31:05.254 --> 31:08.692
celebration of nature."

31:08.736 --> 31:10.303
That's from your world history
class, 11th grade,

31:10.346 --> 31:12.348
Ms. Pierce.

31:12.392 --> 31:14.220
She said it was off topic.

31:14.263 --> 31:15.656
She's short-sighted.

31:15.699 --> 31:18.006
This is insightful and
skillfully reasoned.

31:18.050 --> 31:21.227
You have a passionate
and subtle mind, Nathan,

31:21.270 --> 31:24.273
and you've surrendered to
a group that sees you as some

31:24.317 --> 31:27.102
IT guy they can exploit
for hacking and web design?

31:34.283 --> 31:35.676
I don't know.

31:35.719 --> 31:39.767
I-I think you could be
a great teacher.

31:39.810 --> 31:42.291
I see that in you.

31:49.733 --> 31:51.257
I know who you are.

31:51.300 --> 31:53.041
I wish your wife
had been there

31:53.085 --> 31:55.914
so we could've painted the walls
with her blood.

31:59.352 --> 32:02.355
Violent protests after the death
of a prominent member

32:02.398 --> 32:05.010
of Poland's far right party,
Alek Starowolski.

32:05.053 --> 32:07.447
Starowolski was found
hanging in his hotel room,

32:07.490 --> 32:09.144
but uncorroborated
reports

32:09.188 --> 32:12.669
are calling his death an
assassination orchestrated by

32:12.713 --> 32:14.628
the United States
government in collusion

32:14.671 --> 32:16.499
with Poland's President Demko.

32:16.543 --> 32:17.805
In case there
was any doubt

32:17.848 --> 32:19.807
Russia staged
Starowolski's suicide.

32:19.850 --> 32:21.504
Yeah, classic
Russian move.

32:21.548 --> 32:23.158
Blame your opponents
for your own dirty deeds.

32:23.202 --> 32:24.768
Why does that always work?

32:24.812 --> 32:28.294
This is exactly what
Demko said would happen.

32:28.337 --> 32:30.383
You think he knew Russia
was gonna silence the guy

32:30.426 --> 32:31.427
before we could talk to him?

32:31.471 --> 32:32.646
Or ordered it himself?

32:32.689 --> 32:34.169
ELIZABETH:
I don't know,

32:34.213 --> 32:36.432
but we need to stabilize
things first.

32:36.476 --> 32:40.349
We'll worry about Russia
and who, what, when later.

32:40.393 --> 32:42.699
What are
you thinking?

32:42.743 --> 32:46.660
A personal visit to show
our unwavering support

32:46.703 --> 32:48.270
for President Demko.

32:48.314 --> 32:49.706
MATT: If Poland
is rioting

32:49.750 --> 32:51.534
because they think the U.S.
is secretly attacking

32:51.578 --> 32:52.622
members of their government,

32:52.666 --> 32:55.321
how does going there
help us, exactly?

32:55.364 --> 32:58.106
ELIZABETH: It shows we're
not scared, for one thing.

32:58.150 --> 33:02.545
And it shows that
we stand together.

33:02.589 --> 33:04.373
And it reminds them

33:04.417 --> 33:06.506
what NATO is for,

33:06.549 --> 33:08.595
to keep them safe
from Russian aggression,

33:08.638 --> 33:11.337
which all Poles
can agree on.

33:11.380 --> 33:15.645
So the fringe might
hate us right now,

33:15.689 --> 33:17.647
but they know they need us.

33:17.691 --> 33:19.432
But why not just tell
the far right

33:19.475 --> 33:20.824
they've been backing
a Russian stooge?

33:20.868 --> 33:23.436
'Cause I need to save that card
for another stop.

33:23.479 --> 33:25.003
Will you get me
the Secretary of Defense?

33:25.046 --> 33:26.917
Do we want Kat
on this?

33:26.961 --> 33:31.226
No, she should stay working
on the humanitarian aid packages

33:31.270 --> 33:34.273
at the U.N.
Daisy and I got this one.

33:34.316 --> 33:35.883
Cleminger
clearly stated

33:35.926 --> 33:39.582
the Aryan Popular Force targeted
the United States government.

33:39.626 --> 33:41.802
He said they targeted
any institution

33:41.845 --> 33:43.586
that they felt threatened
the white race.

33:43.630 --> 33:45.066
Are we gonna ignore

33:45.110 --> 33:47.982
that the kid all but confessed
to a role in the attack?

33:48.026 --> 33:49.201
That's debatable.

33:49.244 --> 33:50.376
Well, where's
Justice on this?

33:50.419 --> 33:52.421
We are in uncharted
territory here.

33:52.465 --> 33:55.294
And that is why we need
to get Congress on board.

33:55.337 --> 34:00.081
Technically, the 2001 AUMF
and the 2012 NDAA

34:00.125 --> 34:02.518
lays the legal groundwork
for U.S. citizens

34:02.562 --> 34:04.651
connected to terrorism,
but only in a foreign territory.

34:04.694 --> 34:06.827
EPHRAIM: That was when
the war was foreign.

34:06.870 --> 34:09.395
This time the terrorists
are on our soil.

34:09.438 --> 34:10.874
Henry?

34:10.918 --> 34:12.398
I have got no dispute
that Nathan Cleminger

34:12.441 --> 34:14.226
is a domestic
terrorist.

34:14.269 --> 34:15.705
He's got
the ideology,

34:15.749 --> 34:18.404
he's been fully indoctrinated,
and clearly he's willing

34:18.447 --> 34:20.406
to take violent action
for his beliefs,

34:20.449 --> 34:22.495
but the question is,
did he collaborate

34:22.538 --> 34:25.150
with foreign enemies to attack
the U.S. government?

34:25.193 --> 34:26.368
That is not clear.

34:26.412 --> 34:27.413
Seemed pretty clear to me.

34:27.456 --> 34:28.892
HENRY:
Except he believes

34:28.936 --> 34:32.635
that he's fulfilling the mandate
of our founding fathers,

34:32.679 --> 34:34.159
as twisted as that
logic might be.

34:34.202 --> 34:36.552
We're equivocating over
what this kid believes?

34:36.596 --> 34:39.381
You asked me to make
an ethical recommendation.

34:39.425 --> 34:42.558
Not only am I trying to weigh
the ideology of a neo-Nazi,

34:42.602 --> 34:45.692
I'm also considering
how traumatized we all are

34:45.735 --> 34:47.737
by this attack.

34:47.781 --> 34:49.565
Is it right to exploit

34:49.609 --> 34:51.959
our hunger for justice
to ask Congress

34:52.002 --> 34:53.874
to warp the protections
granted our citizens

34:53.917 --> 34:55.441
by the Constitution?

34:55.484 --> 34:57.443
This is a new war
we're fighting.

34:57.486 --> 34:59.009
It may need new rules.

34:59.053 --> 35:01.229
If we want
to win this war,

35:01.273 --> 35:03.666
we need to remember why
we're fighting it.

35:03.710 --> 35:08.236
These guys think they're
on the side of the Constitution?

35:08.280 --> 35:10.369
Then let them feel

35:10.412 --> 35:11.718
its full weight
and vigor.

35:11.761 --> 35:14.329
Our founding
fathers knew

35:14.373 --> 35:18.159
what people were capable of when
they created the justice system.

35:18.203 --> 35:20.292
I think we should
trust it to do its job

35:20.335 --> 35:22.555
as it always has.

35:27.690 --> 35:30.302
Thank you, everyone.

35:30.345 --> 35:33.696
I'm going to sleep on this.

35:35.437 --> 35:37.700
I, uh...

35:37.744 --> 35:40.268
I appreciate
your input.

35:40.312 --> 35:41.704
NOLAN: Of course,
Mr. President.

35:41.748 --> 35:43.141
Mr. President.
WARE:
Yes, Mr. President.

35:54.630 --> 35:56.110
ELIZABETH:
It is in honor

35:56.154 --> 35:59.113
of our two nations' historic
and longstanding friendship

35:59.157 --> 36:00.288
that the United States

36:00.332 --> 36:02.899
seeks to open
a new chapter

36:02.943 --> 36:06.294
in our partnership
for global stability.

36:06.338 --> 36:09.297
This new, state-of-the-art
military base

36:09.341 --> 36:11.560
will serve all our NATO partners

36:11.604 --> 36:15.390
by securing your eastern border
for generations to come.

36:15.434 --> 36:19.568
President Demko is to be
commended for his commitment

36:19.612 --> 36:23.398
to peace on behalf
of his people and ours.

36:23.442 --> 36:25.661
Thank you.Thank you, Madam Secretary.

36:28.664 --> 36:30.449
Madam Secretary,
what was your role

36:30.492 --> 36:32.712
in the death
of Alek Starowolski?

36:32.755 --> 36:34.670
No questions
at this time, thank you.

36:34.714 --> 36:36.498
Elizabeth, I can't
thank you enough.

36:36.542 --> 36:39.284
You can start by acting
like our ally.

36:39.327 --> 36:41.503
These are
volatile times.

36:41.547 --> 36:43.157
The United States knows that
better than anyone.

36:43.201 --> 36:44.593
The only difference is,

36:44.637 --> 36:46.813
we didn't let the fox
into the henhouse.

36:46.856 --> 36:49.250
If you are in this fight
with us, we're gonna need

36:49.294 --> 36:51.426
to see you get
your house in order

36:51.470 --> 36:53.994
or the military base isn't the
only thing that goes away, okay?

36:54.037 --> 36:56.779
Thank you.

37:02.916 --> 37:05.745
Well played, ma'am.

37:05.788 --> 37:07.834
Yeah. One more stop.

37:11.098 --> 37:12.926
Russell.

37:12.969 --> 37:14.710
Is Elizabeth here?

37:14.754 --> 37:17.713
No, Russell, she's making
a stop in Berlin.

37:17.757 --> 37:20.803
Is everything
all right?

37:20.847 --> 37:23.066
Right.

37:23.110 --> 37:24.981
You can let her know
Dalton pulled out

37:25.025 --> 37:27.941
of the enemy combatant strategy.

37:27.984 --> 37:30.987
Nathan Cleminger is being
charged and a whole phalanx

37:31.031 --> 37:34.164
of lawyers are already
clamoring to take his case.

37:34.208 --> 37:37.690
Too historic
to pass up, I guess.

37:37.733 --> 37:39.779
Yeah.

37:39.822 --> 37:43.957
Congratulations on your powers
of persuasion.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.741
If I didn't think
so highly of you,

37:45.785 --> 37:48.309
I would say that you showed up
here to lay this on me.

37:48.353 --> 37:49.658
Don't ever think
too highly of me.

37:49.702 --> 37:51.312
Do you really think

37:51.356 --> 37:54.881
that I was protecting that kid
after what he said to my face?

37:56.883 --> 38:00.321
O-Oh. But then...

38:00.365 --> 38:02.584
That's why you wanted me
in there, isn't it?

38:02.628 --> 38:04.804
Because you thought
I would be a sure vote.

38:04.847 --> 38:06.588
Of course I wanted
that kid to hang.

38:06.632 --> 38:07.981
I want him in a dark hole

38:08.024 --> 38:09.504
till we get every piece
of information

38:09.548 --> 38:11.898
he's got running around
in his fevered brain. Don't you?

38:11.941 --> 38:15.293
I did the job I was asked.

38:15.336 --> 38:17.860
Yeah, well...

38:17.904 --> 38:22.343
you're a better man than I am.

38:22.387 --> 38:25.128
Speaking of which,

38:25.172 --> 38:28.175
Dalton wants to offer you a
position as his ethics advisor.

38:28.218 --> 38:30.177
Don't ask me
what it means.

38:30.220 --> 38:34.834
He's creating it
for you.

38:34.877 --> 38:37.053
Why don't you come in
and have a drink?

38:42.232 --> 38:45.845
Wouldn't help.
Oh, it might
help to talk.

38:52.373 --> 38:56.029
Should've let June
and Stevie stay home,

38:56.072 --> 38:58.074
all of them.

38:58.118 --> 39:00.903
It was their summer vacation,
for God's sake.

39:04.385 --> 39:06.431
We're gonna stop them.

39:08.998 --> 39:11.436
Not soon enough.

39:11.479 --> 39:14.874
Anyway...

39:14.917 --> 39:17.790
On with the
noble fight.

39:17.833 --> 39:20.662
I'll see you in
the White House.

39:28.888 --> 39:32.239
It's good to see you
in the sunshine,

39:32.282 --> 39:33.936
Madam Secretary.

39:33.980 --> 39:34.981
Pretty, isn't it?

39:35.024 --> 39:37.766
Mm.

39:37.810 --> 39:41.770
Almost as if democracy
weren't under siege.

39:41.814 --> 39:43.555
Your recent
difficulties

39:43.598 --> 39:47.472
have soured
your usual optimism.

39:47.515 --> 39:50.431
I wonder how much you know
about our recent difficulties,

39:50.475 --> 39:52.868
particularly in Poland.

39:52.912 --> 39:57.917
I sense we're not here
to share an ice cream.

39:57.960 --> 40:02.704
What are our Slavic brothers
up to now?

40:02.748 --> 40:04.880
I'm not playing games,
Konstantin.

40:04.924 --> 40:07.796
We know that Russia
was providing financial support

40:07.840 --> 40:09.972
to Starowolski.

40:10.016 --> 40:11.626
We have proof,

40:11.670 --> 40:14.803
and if we were to expose that
to the Polish people,

40:14.847 --> 40:18.328
it could cause both countries
a great deal of trouble.

40:18.372 --> 40:21.419
So tell your bot farm
or whoever it is

40:21.462 --> 40:25.466
that's churning out these rumors
that the U.S. somehow ordered

40:25.510 --> 40:29.992
Starowolski's assassination
to knock it off.

40:30.036 --> 40:33.518
I would suggest,

40:33.561 --> 40:36.999
Elizabeth,
that you tread carefully

40:37.043 --> 40:39.654
before making an accusation

40:39.698 --> 40:42.135
about Russia being involved

40:42.178 --> 40:46.574
in a political assassination
without evidence.

40:51.231 --> 40:54.626
That line in
the path there,

40:54.669 --> 40:57.846
that's where the
Berlin Wall once stood.

40:57.890 --> 40:59.021
They had this
big celebration

40:59.065 --> 41:00.545
on the 20th anniversary

41:00.588 --> 41:02.416
of the wall coming down,
did you see it?

41:02.460 --> 41:05.854
They-they
set up these

41:05.898 --> 41:09.641
huge dominoes

41:09.684 --> 41:13.340
along the path, right to
the Brandenburg Gate,

41:13.383 --> 41:15.864
then they knocked
them all down.

41:15.908 --> 41:18.258
Just like

41:18.301 --> 41:21.043
the fragile network of empires

41:21.087 --> 41:24.090
that fell in the 20th century,

41:24.133 --> 41:27.006
one after the other.

41:27.049 --> 41:29.922
A chilling metaphor.

41:29.965 --> 41:32.098
What is your point?

41:34.404 --> 41:38.234
I can't prove that Russia
ordered the assassination

41:38.278 --> 41:40.498
of a Polish nationalist

41:40.541 --> 41:42.978
or that they
tried to frame

41:43.022 --> 41:45.851
the U.S.
for doing it,

41:45.894 --> 41:48.549
but it's pretty clear
that someone in your government

41:48.593 --> 41:50.769
wants to be in the chaos game.

41:50.812 --> 41:54.033
And these forces
they're unleashing,

41:54.076 --> 41:57.384
the hatred and fear,

41:57.427 --> 41:59.952
no one gets
to control them.

41:59.995 --> 42:04.565
The dominoes won't stop
at your shores, Konstantin.

42:04.609 --> 42:07.916
To think,
only a few months ago,

42:07.960 --> 42:09.918
we were working together

42:09.962 --> 42:14.880
to end the threat
of nuclear war.

42:14.923 --> 42:17.578
And I hope
we can collaborate again,

42:17.622 --> 42:20.146
but until then,
here's my message:

42:20.189 --> 42:23.062
No reckless attack
on our democracy

42:23.105 --> 42:26.848
will ever shake America's
commitment to her core values.

42:26.892 --> 42:29.068
And any country
that tries

42:29.111 --> 42:33.855
will face dire consequences
so much worse

42:33.899 --> 42:37.032
than one lucky RPG hit.

42:40.427 --> 42:46.999
