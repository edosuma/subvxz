WEBVTT

00:35.245 --> 00:36.815
Perfect day for a game.

00:48.359 --> 00:49.594
You can't move there.

00:55.232 --> 00:56.833
Now we have to restart.

01:41.515 --> 01:43.448
I can't find focus.

01:43.450 --> 01:45.584
Does this have a macro setting?

01:45.586 --> 01:47.652
It defaults to it if you're
close enough, I think.

01:47.654 --> 01:49.120
Sorry Tonya, you were saying?
I couldn't be any closer.

01:49.122 --> 01:50.423
No, just putting my acting
career,

01:50.425 --> 01:53.593
well everything, to look after.

01:53.595 --> 01:54.727
How's your shot?
It's a nightmare.

01:54.729 --> 01:56.496
I actually went through a
similar thing with my mom.

01:56.498 --> 01:57.797
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:57.799 --> 01:59.097
Your shot?

01:59.099 --> 02:00.031
Uh, it's fine.

02:00.033 --> 02:02.100
It's just, it's a squared-off
two-shot.

02:02.102 --> 02:05.303
But you're kinda like close and
interrogating him.

02:05.305 --> 02:06.104
Okay.

02:06.941 --> 02:07.874
How are the levels?

02:07.876 --> 02:10.375
Don't worry about me, it's just
for James.

02:10.377 --> 02:11.477
I don't know.

02:11.479 --> 02:12.679
James, can you say
something for us

02:12.681 --> 02:14.182
in your normal speaking voice?

02:15.384 --> 02:16.215
Daddy?

02:16.217 --> 02:17.451
Is that GoPro on?

02:17.453 --> 02:18.519
I need...

02:18.521 --> 02:20.587
We need that for the two-shot so
I can cut between.

02:20.589 --> 02:21.957
We need that master.

02:24.827 --> 02:26.660
You guys should know something.

02:26.662 --> 02:29.963
My husband, Jeff, isn't quite as
open-minded

02:29.965 --> 02:32.098
about what we're doing here.

02:32.100 --> 02:33.834
He knows it's my decision and my
dad's decision,

02:33.836 --> 02:36.370
but if you could just try and
keep it just on us,

02:36.372 --> 02:37.805
- me and my dad.
- No, that's fine.

02:37.807 --> 02:38.940
He'll sign a release though
right?

02:38.942 --> 02:41.611
Yeah, he just doesn't want to be
in it.

02:47.216 --> 02:48.485
Tonya!

02:49.953 --> 02:51.051
They're still here.

02:51.053 --> 02:51.886
Yeah.

02:51.888 --> 02:52.787
And my dad is still alive.

02:52.789 --> 02:53.988
Thank you very much for asking.

02:53.990 --> 02:55.590
Then why aren't you in there
with him instead of out here

02:55.592 --> 02:56.758
flirting with this fucker?
Jeff what are you doing?

02:56.760 --> 02:58.026
I think you're getting the wrong
impression.

02:58.028 --> 02:59.529
Fucking asshole!

03:08.104 --> 03:10.041
Where are my glasses?

03:10.975 --> 03:13.143
Pretty sure you had your
contacts in.

03:15.980 --> 03:16.879
No, no, no.

03:16.881 --> 03:17.880
I wanna go back to that shot.

03:17.882 --> 03:19.481
Stop thinking about it.

03:19.483 --> 03:20.649
It's time to talk to Ted.

03:20.651 --> 03:22.352
We gotta sell him on this
footage.

03:23.219 --> 03:24.523
I have an idea for that.

03:25.924 --> 03:27.023
Ted.

03:27.025 --> 03:29.325
Guys, what the hell do you think
you're doing?

03:29.327 --> 03:30.660
You'll never get his release.

03:30.662 --> 03:32.361
Your footage is unusable.

03:32.363 --> 03:34.598
I had them right here.

03:34.600 --> 03:35.667
Okay, but...

03:36.735 --> 03:39.134
Let us go back and smooth things
over.

03:39.136 --> 03:41.938
I mean, that guy James is gonna
clock out any second now.

03:41.940 --> 03:42.939
Yeah, that's the other thing.

03:42.941 --> 03:44.674
Think of your audience.

03:44.676 --> 03:46.543
You can't just show a bunch of
random people dying.

03:46.545 --> 03:48.280
We are thinking of the audience.

03:49.381 --> 03:51.649
There's this professor who
developed this thing

03:51.651 --> 03:53.551
called the God Helmet.

03:53.553 --> 03:56.954
And it's supposedly this rig
that you wear.

03:56.956 --> 03:59.624
You go into this room, and they
use magnetism

03:59.626 --> 04:02.526
to kind of induce a God-like
experience,

04:02.528 --> 04:05.496
or a near-death experience, and
it's totally safe.

04:05.498 --> 04:06.864
Supposedly.

04:06.866 --> 04:08.532
I think for this documentary

04:08.534 --> 04:11.736
we can go for more of a
universal approach

04:11.738 --> 04:14.906
of how we think of our own
mortality or existence.

04:14.908 --> 04:17.843
Death is just a part of that.

04:17.845 --> 04:20.680
You're not worried about your
brain getting magnetized?

04:21.749 --> 04:23.314
It's gotta be safe.

04:23.316 --> 04:26.418
Safe enough if they're using it
at a university.

04:26.420 --> 04:29.121
Okay, show me what you can find.

04:29.123 --> 04:30.055
All right.

04:35.361 --> 04:37.295
Get some B-roll at the
university

04:37.297 --> 04:40.466
while we still got the weather.

04:40.468 --> 04:42.602
Let's get it tomorrow.

04:42.604 --> 04:44.470
I wanna get in that God Helmet.

04:44.472 --> 04:46.839
Yeah, but if it rains tomorrow,
which it says it might,

04:46.841 --> 04:48.743
then we can't get the shots that
we need.

04:50.478 --> 04:54.881
Like just for each set up, do a
static, a tilt down,

04:54.883 --> 04:56.314
- and a pan over.
- Yeah.

04:56.316 --> 04:57.349
It's fine.

04:57.351 --> 04:58.185
I got it.

05:00.456 --> 05:01.755
Establishing shots in the rain

05:01.757 --> 05:04.960
might serve us better anyway,
thematically.

05:06.361 --> 05:07.362
Devil's advocate.

05:10.566 --> 05:12.833
Clouds of uncertainty.

05:12.835 --> 05:14.768
My mom didn't know what the fuck
was going on at the end

05:14.770 --> 05:17.705
but she was still scared
shitless.

05:17.707 --> 05:19.372
What's a bright and
sunny day at school

05:19.374 --> 05:21.207
have to do with any of that?

05:21.209 --> 05:23.012
But not everyone sees it that
way.

05:24.047 --> 05:24.848
Think about it.

05:26.650 --> 05:27.882
If you believe in immortality

05:27.884 --> 05:29.753
then death is an exciting
prospect.

05:35.425 --> 05:37.459
By the way, you're shooting.

05:37.461 --> 05:39.861
I'm test driving the God Helmet.

05:39.863 --> 05:41.730
Okay, let's see here.

05:41.732 --> 05:42.566
There.

05:43.567 --> 05:44.501
Yup, check.

06:06.457 --> 06:10.291
Okay, Mike, do you feel
comfortable enough to start?

06:10.293 --> 06:11.129
Yeah.

06:12.164 --> 06:12.998
Sure.

06:31.183 --> 06:33.284
Is that light staying on?

06:37.590 --> 06:40.323
You shouldn't be seeing any kind
of a light yet.

06:40.325 --> 06:41.995
Eric, we cleared the...

06:43.663 --> 06:45.297
the gear from the hospice,
right?

06:47.233 --> 06:48.067
Was it...

06:50.570 --> 06:51.571
My glasses, right?

06:54.207 --> 06:55.241
Did I forget my...

06:57.143 --> 06:58.476
No, I got it.

06:58.478 --> 06:59.311
Okay.

07:00.181 --> 07:01.079
Yeah, I'm good.

07:01.081 --> 07:02.281
I'm good.

07:02.283 --> 07:05.150
Mike, I'm not gonna be able to
increase the current here

07:05.152 --> 07:07.986
until we get you straightened
out a bit.

07:07.988 --> 07:09.355
Are you feeling okay?

07:10.891 --> 07:12.524
Is he on something?

07:12.526 --> 07:13.494
It's okay.

07:15.129 --> 07:15.963
I'm fine.

07:17.097 --> 07:17.930
Eric gets it.

07:17.932 --> 07:20.000
I was just, the darkness,
you...

07:21.435 --> 07:22.937
start to think about...

07:25.006 --> 07:27.540
the girl at the Hospice.

07:27.542 --> 07:29.209
Tonya?

07:29.211 --> 07:30.245
I think was her name?

07:33.014 --> 07:34.314
I'm fine.

07:44.092 --> 07:45.392
Don't worry about Tonya.

07:46.360 --> 07:47.429
It's okay to forget.

07:48.431 --> 07:50.533
Just try to focus
on the here...

07:51.901 --> 07:52.735
and now.

07:54.369 --> 07:58.305
Even here and now
there's like...

07:58.307 --> 08:00.207
me...

08:00.209 --> 08:01.644
and you...

08:03.045 --> 08:04.578
her...

08:04.580 --> 08:08.549
I think her name was Tonya, and
her dad was there.

08:08.551 --> 08:10.184
And...

08:10.186 --> 08:13.154
Okay.

08:13.156 --> 08:14.456
I'm pretty sure it was her.

08:16.059 --> 08:18.426
Listen to my voice.

08:18.428 --> 08:21.796
Her name was Tonya, but you
don't need to remember her now.

08:21.798 --> 08:23.798
Let yourself forget.

08:23.800 --> 08:25.302
It's her.

08:43.321 --> 08:45.121
They need more blood-work.

08:45.123 --> 08:46.357
Can I book it for Monday?

08:58.703 --> 09:01.573
Colonizing another planet is
supposed to be hard.

09:13.252 --> 09:14.518
Why don't I go down to the lab

09:14.520 --> 09:16.055
and see how our boys are doing?

09:30.503 --> 09:32.603
I thought we agreed I'd see some
progress today.

09:32.605 --> 09:34.806
We were just about to stop his
program.

09:34.808 --> 09:36.507
So that's nine days wasted.

09:36.509 --> 09:37.342
What was the program?

09:37.344 --> 09:38.776
It was the atrium module.

09:38.778 --> 09:41.179
Playing chess, checkers,
birdwatching...

09:41.181 --> 09:42.113
For nine days?

09:42.115 --> 09:43.049
No variation?

09:44.050 --> 09:45.016
Did he kill himself?

09:45.018 --> 09:46.617
No, he just hit a barrier.

09:46.619 --> 09:49.355
His brain was running
beautifully, everything gelled,

09:49.357 --> 09:52.391
then bam, everything stopped
integrating for him.

09:52.393 --> 09:54.059
Now we gotta pull him out.

09:54.061 --> 09:54.927
Do it then.

09:54.929 --> 09:55.761
Let me talk to him.

09:55.763 --> 09:56.628
Sir...

09:56.630 --> 09:58.163
Miss, I don't think we can do
that.

09:58.165 --> 09:59.598
- He won't be in any state-
- If you're getting anywhere

09:59.600 --> 10:02.601
at all, he should be able to
transition easily.

10:02.603 --> 10:04.705
We're not sending vegetables to
the stars.

10:05.539 --> 10:06.473
Pull him out now.

10:06.475 --> 10:08.674
Set up the interview room so I
can watch.

10:08.676 --> 10:09.842
I'll give you 10 minutes.

10:09.844 --> 10:10.945
And get a fucking bib.

11:06.103 --> 11:07.237
Lieutenant Duncan?

11:09.373 --> 11:10.207
Uh-huh.

11:14.011 --> 11:15.610
My face still feels...

11:15.612 --> 11:16.678
That's normal.

11:16.680 --> 11:18.180
And you said that last time.

11:18.182 --> 11:19.083
Do you remember?

11:21.285 --> 11:22.119
What's your name?

11:26.257 --> 11:29.528
Lieutenant Chris Duncan...

11:30.529 --> 11:31.360
retired.

11:31.362 --> 11:33.164
No, you were discharged.

11:41.574 --> 11:44.142
You do realize your team is the
bottleneck?

11:45.578 --> 11:48.914
Your progress has been
intolerable.

11:50.450 --> 11:53.350
I have a chess board, but we can
also play checkers.

11:53.352 --> 11:54.651
It's reversible.

11:54.653 --> 11:56.122
Which would you like to play?

11:57.756 --> 11:58.592
Um...

12:00.460 --> 12:02.226
Which did we play last time?

12:02.228 --> 12:03.062
Chess.

12:04.864 --> 12:05.831
Okay.

12:08.667 --> 12:09.503
Checkers.

12:15.108 --> 12:16.374
Holy shit!

12:16.376 --> 12:18.309
Were gonna lose him!

12:31.158 --> 12:31.992
Mike?

12:33.628 --> 12:35.362
You've gone radio silent on me
man.

12:39.066 --> 12:39.899
Is this...

12:39.901 --> 12:40.735
Is this still it?

12:43.137 --> 12:44.372
You okay buddy?

12:46.807 --> 12:47.775
Yeah, I just...

12:49.944 --> 12:50.778
Okay.

12:56.083 --> 12:58.284
Put my hands up in the field of
vision.

12:58.286 --> 12:59.285
I can't see them.

12:59.287 --> 13:00.789
That kinda ruins the illusion.

13:04.460 --> 13:05.294
Turn.

13:07.696 --> 13:12.232
You should be able to toggle
on/off on the motion sensor.

13:12.234 --> 13:13.835
I wanted to keep going that way.

13:17.239 --> 13:19.409
Resolution could be a little
better.

13:21.977 --> 13:23.844
So, nerd shit aside,

13:23.846 --> 13:26.182
what does this have to do with
the documentary?

13:27.984 --> 13:31.052
The doc isn't about death, it's
about life.

13:31.054 --> 13:32.720
Human experience.

13:33.957 --> 13:36.726
VR is a bridge to whole new
worlds of potential experience.

13:38.094 --> 13:39.996
This one needs better software
though.

13:42.666 --> 13:44.065
Okay, let me try.

13:45.802 --> 13:46.637
In a minute.

14:03.521 --> 14:04.522
What the...

14:08.359 --> 14:10.127
Whatcha got?

14:11.830 --> 14:13.064
It's me.

14:14.467 --> 14:16.065
How can it...

14:16.067 --> 14:17.369
This is impossible.

14:18.571 --> 14:19.802
We would have known if someone
was doing

14:19.804 --> 14:21.574
a goddamn 360 capture.

14:22.575 --> 14:24.142
Someone's coming down the hall.

14:27.912 --> 14:28.913
You're here.

14:30.348 --> 14:31.914
But someone's missing.

14:34.319 --> 14:35.388
Where is she?

14:42.128 --> 14:43.129
Holy shit.

14:56.876 --> 14:59.714
It looks a little forced, like,
the staging of it.

15:01.848 --> 15:03.449
We need a break.

15:03.451 --> 15:04.916
I need to get drunk.

15:04.918 --> 15:07.689
No, we've gotta get at least to
the end of this scene.

15:10.257 --> 15:12.192
You look like you're
hallucinating.

15:15.596 --> 15:17.397
I'm not hallucinating.

15:20.601 --> 15:22.202
I just feel like I'm in a dream.

15:23.672 --> 15:26.809
You gotta pull back and let
things percolate a bit.

15:29.578 --> 15:31.010
Yeah, but...

15:31.012 --> 15:32.413
when we uh...

15:33.348 --> 15:34.616
go in the hole...

15:38.454 --> 15:39.455
the um...

15:42.223 --> 15:44.123
Yeah, I don't know what I'm
talking about.

16:07.484 --> 16:09.983
It actually felt like I was in
the scenes,

16:09.985 --> 16:14.055
like, experiencing everything
from the camera's perspective,

16:14.057 --> 16:17.125
except I was in the scenes.

16:17.127 --> 16:18.393
Pretty sickening feeling

16:18.395 --> 16:21.530
kinda losing the forest for the
trees, you know?

16:21.532 --> 16:23.030
But it works.

16:23.032 --> 16:26.267
It's postmodern, but the
audience knows

16:26.269 --> 16:28.169
they're being toyed with.

16:28.171 --> 16:32.841
It's artificial, but we're still
with the main characters

16:32.843 --> 16:34.909
because they also are being
toyed with.

16:34.911 --> 16:36.882
Turn it off for the night.

16:45.289 --> 16:47.426
Think any of 'em read a book in
the last year?

16:48.427 --> 16:49.258
You get the first round.

16:49.260 --> 16:51.061
I gotta say hi to someone.

21:09.098 --> 21:09.932
Begin.

21:17.073 --> 21:19.540
No crystallization, glucose
level high,

21:19.542 --> 21:22.676
and they've been staying high
after reanimation.

21:22.678 --> 21:25.080
So it's still, what, just the
damn gamma waves?

21:25.082 --> 21:26.815
That's the main problem, give or
take.

21:26.817 --> 21:28.518
They just don't want to
integrate.

21:29.453 --> 21:32.352
Ensign Walker here is coming out
of program Zenith.

21:32.354 --> 21:34.024
12-to-one time dilation.

21:35.992 --> 21:37.594
Let's hear what he has to say.

21:45.535 --> 21:48.037
Beta function surprisingly good.

21:48.039 --> 21:49.270
Gammas?

21:51.976 --> 21:53.678
Neil, do you know where you are?

21:57.081 --> 21:59.884
How many times have I...
Answer the question please.

22:01.853 --> 22:03.121
Yes.

22:04.421 --> 22:05.721
What year is it?

22:05.723 --> 22:07.388
It's the same year you went
under.

22:07.390 --> 22:08.993
What year do you think it is?

22:12.030 --> 22:13.997
3,000?

22:13.999 --> 22:15.832
4,000?

22:15.834 --> 22:18.070
A.D.?

22:20.271 --> 22:21.104
What?

22:21.106 --> 22:22.338
What...

22:22.340 --> 22:23.242
What's your name?

22:24.209 --> 22:25.043
Neil.

22:26.078 --> 22:27.477
Why wouldn't I know my name?

22:27.479 --> 22:28.747
I know my own name.

22:33.351 --> 22:35.387
Strong impulse at 36 Hz.

22:36.421 --> 22:39.959
Hey, I know it's disorienting,
but it's gonna be okay.

22:41.661 --> 22:42.562
Oh shit.

23:01.115 --> 23:02.748
Gammas still...

23:02.750 --> 23:04.616
This makes no sense.

23:04.618 --> 23:06.185
He's catatonic.

23:06.187 --> 23:07.121
No shit!

23:08.556 --> 23:10.958
Wake up all the subjects and
send them home.

23:11.992 --> 23:13.194
We're changing tacks.

23:15.596 --> 23:16.497
Fuck off.

24:05.281 --> 24:06.115
Ow!

24:09.452 --> 24:10.286
Hey.

24:13.422 --> 24:14.289
Wow!

24:14.291 --> 24:15.557
Good morning to you too.

24:15.559 --> 24:16.392
Who...

24:18.095 --> 24:19.393
What are you doing here?

24:19.395 --> 24:20.695
What am I...

24:20.697 --> 24:21.531
What?

24:23.767 --> 24:24.601
There's a gap.

24:26.970 --> 24:27.804
You.

24:30.707 --> 24:31.875
No, I can't explain it.

24:44.455 --> 24:45.288
Hello?

24:45.290 --> 24:46.491
What happened last night?

24:47.558 --> 24:48.658
What do you mean?

24:48.660 --> 24:50.293
There's like a girl in my bed.

24:50.295 --> 24:51.227
Hello?

24:51.229 --> 24:53.464
Holy shit, I am a miracle
worker.

24:54.399 --> 24:56.532
Wait, did you fucking drug me?

24:56.534 --> 24:58.200
Is she a hooker?

24:58.202 --> 24:59.571
Man, take it easy.

25:01.440 --> 25:02.341
The club.

25:09.982 --> 25:11.348
You know her, I saw you.

25:11.350 --> 25:13.383
Are you talking to someone?

25:13.385 --> 25:14.451
The club.

25:14.453 --> 25:17.220
Yeah, well, I talked to a lot of
ladies last night.

25:17.222 --> 25:18.455
Wait, is she still there?

25:18.457 --> 25:19.323
Yes!

25:19.325 --> 25:21.825
Hey, I'm embarrassed too, you
know.

25:21.827 --> 25:24.062
Hang on, you locked yourself in
the bathroom

25:24.064 --> 25:24.963
to call your friend about...

25:24.965 --> 25:26.130
How do you know I'm in the
bathroom?

25:26.132 --> 25:27.031
Are you just going to hide in
there

25:27.033 --> 25:28.032
until I leave?

25:28.034 --> 25:29.834
I haven't decided yet!

25:29.836 --> 25:31.269
What the fuck is going on?

25:31.271 --> 25:33.237
Let me save you the trouble and
leave now.

25:33.239 --> 25:34.374
Nice to meet you, Mike!

25:35.675 --> 25:38.609
First things first, go make her
some eggs,

25:38.611 --> 25:39.679
bare fucking minimum.

25:40.880 --> 25:43.283
Call me later if you're still
pissed about getting laid.

25:53.627 --> 25:54.461
Wait.

25:54.463 --> 25:55.828
I didn't get your name.

25:55.830 --> 25:56.864
Don't worry about it.

25:58.399 --> 25:59.798
Stop.

25:59.800 --> 26:01.902
Please, tell me your name.

26:07.308 --> 26:08.374
Sophie.

26:08.376 --> 26:09.210
Sophie.

26:12.014 --> 26:14.881
No, sorry, I still don't
remember.

26:14.883 --> 26:17.884
Look, I don't do one night
stands either.

26:17.886 --> 26:19.519
Neither do I.

26:19.521 --> 26:22.055
So, let me at yeast cook you
some eggs

26:22.057 --> 26:24.126
so it's a night and a morning.

26:32.601 --> 26:33.433
Thanks.

26:33.435 --> 26:34.735
Sorry.

26:34.737 --> 26:36.172
I mean, yeah, you're welcome.

26:46.315 --> 26:47.283
Um...

26:48.317 --> 26:50.753
So, what's your movie about?

26:54.557 --> 26:55.890
Or was that just a pick-up line?

26:55.892 --> 26:57.226
Oh, movie.

26:58.127 --> 26:59.227
It's a documentary.

26:59.229 --> 27:00.128
Well, part narrative.

27:00.130 --> 27:03.398
It's about what happens after
you die.

27:03.400 --> 27:04.500
Like after it...

27:04.502 --> 27:06.070
What happens after it happens.

27:08.138 --> 27:08.970
Mm-hm.

27:08.972 --> 27:10.038
Sounds a little pretentious

27:10.040 --> 27:12.009
now that you've made me say it
out loud, though.

27:13.977 --> 27:14.978
Well...

27:16.113 --> 27:20.082
I don't know about you, but I
could use some coffee.

27:20.084 --> 27:21.049
God yes.

28:36.964 --> 28:38.898
Where's our first stop?

28:38.900 --> 28:39.867
Caledon.

28:45.206 --> 28:47.408
Where are we ultimately headed
to, though?

28:49.611 --> 28:53.145
What's that, a metaphor or
something?

28:53.147 --> 28:54.313
You're the one driving the
trailer.

28:54.315 --> 28:56.115
How do you not know
where we're going?

28:56.117 --> 28:58.286
Yeah, yeah, there's is a nice
way to answer that, too.

29:08.230 --> 29:09.499
You're married?

29:12.968 --> 29:16.036
I just hate it when single
chicks wear fake wedding rings

29:16.038 --> 29:18.539
'cause they're constantly having
to ward off

29:18.541 --> 29:20.543
all these guys that are hitting
on them.

29:21.376 --> 29:22.277
Is that it?

29:23.480 --> 29:24.946
Uh...

29:24.948 --> 29:27.949
I wear my wedding ring because
we're married.

29:27.951 --> 29:29.651
That's what people do.

29:29.653 --> 29:31.786
Just 'cause you're too cool to
wear yours

29:31.788 --> 29:33.856
doesn't mean I'm gonna stop
wearing mine.

29:35.124 --> 29:36.257
What the fuck are you talking
about?

29:36.259 --> 29:37.360
Never mind.

29:41.798 --> 29:42.633
We're married.

29:45.268 --> 29:47.604
- Yeah, you said that.
- Yeah, and?

29:47.606 --> 29:48.471
Are you fucking nuts?

29:48.473 --> 29:49.306
We just met.

29:50.274 --> 29:51.139
Wait, do you go around telling

29:51.141 --> 29:52.810
all your girlfriends that we're
married?

29:54.411 --> 29:55.879
You're not joking, are you?

29:57.881 --> 29:58.914
Okay, look, pull over.

29:58.916 --> 29:59.982
This can't be safe.

29:59.984 --> 30:01.183
Pull over, what can't be safe?

30:01.185 --> 30:02.417
You're just trying to make me

30:02.419 --> 30:03.486
- fucking feel crazy right now!
- Mike, please can you just

30:03.488 --> 30:04.319
pull over?

30:04.321 --> 30:05.389
I don't want you driving.

30:06.290 --> 30:07.424
How do you know Eric?

30:10.094 --> 30:11.629
Mike.

30:11.631 --> 30:13.597
I think you're having one of
those episodes,

30:13.599 --> 30:15.699
or like, one of those attacks.

30:15.701 --> 30:16.533
Attacks?

30:16.535 --> 30:17.333
You're literally the person

30:17.335 --> 30:18.234
who just said that we're
married!

30:18.236 --> 30:19.070
Because we are!

30:21.139 --> 30:21.973
We are.

30:24.242 --> 30:25.343
Ask anyone we know.

30:26.878 --> 30:27.812
I just...

30:29.214 --> 30:31.283
I don't think you should be
driving.

30:32.450 --> 30:33.751
Okay, I can drive for a bit.

30:33.753 --> 30:35.587
You can lay down in the back.

30:35.589 --> 30:38.856
Or we can pull over and call it
a day.

30:38.858 --> 30:39.758
Anything you want.

30:39.760 --> 30:41.660
I just...

30:51.304 --> 30:52.303
Babe, what are you doing?

30:52.305 --> 30:53.705
You need to leave me alone.

30:53.707 --> 30:55.339
But we're in the middle of
nowhere!

30:55.341 --> 30:56.173
No, stop!

30:56.175 --> 30:57.841
I'm not having an episode, okay?

30:57.843 --> 30:58.977
This is something else.

30:58.979 --> 31:01.446
I don't remember how I got here!

31:01.448 --> 31:02.914
I remember seeing
you at the club,

31:02.916 --> 31:05.450
the next morning, breakfast,
eggs.

31:05.452 --> 31:06.552
And then just all these, like,

31:06.554 --> 31:09.187
these flashes of all these
memories together.

31:09.189 --> 31:11.323
A montage you'd see in a movie,
okay?

31:11.325 --> 31:13.224
And I get that it adds up to us,

31:13.226 --> 31:16.629
and that I care for you, but
we're not fucking married!

31:16.631 --> 31:17.463
Okay?

31:17.465 --> 31:18.731
Where's all the stuff in
between?

31:18.733 --> 31:19.799
Our engagement?

31:19.801 --> 31:20.633
The arguments?

31:20.635 --> 31:22.769
All the stuff that makes it
connect?

31:22.771 --> 31:24.270
Okay?

31:24.272 --> 31:25.237
- Just come back...
- No, look.

31:25.239 --> 31:27.440
You can either stay here or go
back there,

31:27.442 --> 31:29.175
but don't fucking follow me!

31:29.177 --> 31:32.978
I know that you and all this is
a distraction,

31:32.980 --> 31:34.213
and I know the difference now.

31:34.215 --> 31:35.381
Mike, can you please just...

31:35.383 --> 31:36.415
What?

31:36.417 --> 31:39.118
You're gonna tell me that it's
all in my head?

31:39.120 --> 31:40.587
That everything's fine?

31:40.589 --> 31:42.489
I know the difference!

33:01.406 --> 33:02.540
You cheated.

33:02.542 --> 33:03.908
Somehow.

33:03.910 --> 33:05.008
Only in part.

33:05.010 --> 33:05.845
Screen.

33:07.446 --> 33:08.779
Mike, playback.

33:08.781 --> 33:10.048
Start to zero-five.

33:11.818 --> 33:12.984
Yes, playback.

33:14.854 --> 33:16.085
You guys controlled your avatars

33:16.087 --> 33:18.823
in a two-dimensional, top-down
view.

33:18.825 --> 33:20.724
But I was playing in three
dimensions.

33:20.726 --> 33:22.794
Mike, render 3D.

33:22.796 --> 33:24.130
Yes, render.

33:25.599 --> 33:26.432
Continue.

33:27.568 --> 33:28.401
Side view.

33:29.470 --> 33:31.470
Introducing one set of
restricted representations

33:31.472 --> 33:33.605
meant I could save time
programming graphics

33:33.607 --> 33:35.642
and control code for the third
axis.

33:40.079 --> 33:43.314
We were playing three
dimensions, you just assumed two.

33:43.316 --> 33:45.115
I sold you the illusion of
complete freedom

33:45.117 --> 33:47.522
knowing you guys would act like
flatlands.

33:48.422 --> 33:50.790
I've already talked up Bridges
to Infinity 3.

33:50.792 --> 33:54.125
It has to be a complete paradigm
shift in gaming.

33:54.127 --> 33:56.394
And the key to the architecture

33:56.396 --> 33:58.029
will be to exploit the
difference

33:58.031 --> 34:00.900
between the the interface and
the representation.

34:00.902 --> 34:02.367
It can't be fake.

34:02.369 --> 34:03.836
It's gotta be real life.

34:06.608 --> 34:07.740
Who knows I'm up here?

34:07.742 --> 34:08.574
No one.

34:08.576 --> 34:10.309
Nothing to do with me.

34:10.311 --> 34:11.143
Okay, fine.

34:11.145 --> 34:12.311
That's enough for today.

34:12.313 --> 34:13.581
Screen, sleep away.

34:18.219 --> 34:20.319
Hi, are you Mike?

34:20.321 --> 34:21.621
This is a private island.

34:21.623 --> 34:22.455
Yes, I know.

34:22.456 --> 34:23.291
Can we talk?

34:25.426 --> 34:26.960
Um, outside.

34:27.795 --> 34:29.161
I work with the Fuller
Corporation.

34:29.163 --> 34:32.130
I'd like to discuss an
interesting opportunity.

34:45.214 --> 34:46.781
Calm down!

34:46.783 --> 34:47.650
One second.

35:09.406 --> 35:10.240
Shh.

36:13.474 --> 36:14.473
Hey man.

36:14.475 --> 36:15.907
Eric, I need a favor.

36:23.017 --> 36:24.650
What happened?

36:24.652 --> 36:25.484
I don't know.

36:25.486 --> 36:26.685
Lost reception.

36:26.687 --> 36:27.519
You feeling all right?

36:27.521 --> 36:29.320
You sound a little weird.

36:29.322 --> 36:31.455
Something's up with my brain.

36:31.457 --> 36:32.291
Maybe...

36:35.597 --> 36:36.731
Everything seems foggy.

36:38.298 --> 36:40.099
I think I'm having some sort of
episode,

36:40.101 --> 36:41.870
but I don't have episodes.

36:43.270 --> 36:44.169
Right?

36:47.142 --> 36:47.974
Still there?

36:47.976 --> 36:48.808
Yeah.

36:48.810 --> 36:49.642
Hey, where are you?

36:49.644 --> 36:52.346
Looks like Askin and Wyandotte.

36:57.217 --> 36:58.554
I'm just parked up here.

37:00.856 --> 37:03.425
So we're driving along,
everything's fine.

37:04.292 --> 37:07.094
Then I notice she's got this
fucking wedding ring on.

37:07.096 --> 37:09.598
She says we're married with a
total straight face.

37:11.232 --> 37:13.801
It's like everywhere I look,
it's fucking cardboard cutouts.

37:16.271 --> 37:20.375
I mean, sometimes things do go
wrong upstairs, chemically.

37:22.012 --> 37:24.447
I'm not saying you're crazy or
anything, but...

37:25.782 --> 37:27.347
Mike, this is not the first time

37:27.349 --> 37:28.752
we've had this conversation.

37:30.587 --> 37:31.788
How many times?

37:32.789 --> 37:34.124
Three, four?

37:35.492 --> 37:38.258
Your doctor said it wasn't a
stroke, it was just an episode.

37:38.260 --> 37:40.528
Last time you just kinda...

37:40.530 --> 37:41.363
reset.

37:45.434 --> 37:46.571
She is your wife.

37:51.209 --> 37:52.375
It'll come back to you.

37:54.679 --> 37:56.114
She deserves an explanation.

37:58.216 --> 38:01.052
And a bit of hope things'll go
back to normal.

38:02.285 --> 38:03.121
Fine.

38:15.667 --> 38:16.668
I'm sorry.

38:17.669 --> 38:19.069
It's okay.

38:19.071 --> 38:20.302
It's not your fault.

38:20.304 --> 38:21.238
I know that.

38:21.240 --> 38:22.072
It is.

38:22.074 --> 38:22.908
I...

38:24.910 --> 38:27.045
I got confused and I took it out
on you.

38:29.681 --> 38:33.817
How 'bout a swim?

38:33.819 --> 38:35.655
The water's real nice.

39:46.596 --> 39:48.965
Now very slowly come back to the
room.

39:49.999 --> 39:51.399
Feel the chair beneath you.

39:53.903 --> 39:55.302
What just happened?

39:55.304 --> 39:57.671
We just successfully hypnotized
you.

39:57.673 --> 39:58.507
On camera.

39:59.675 --> 40:00.608
No.

40:00.610 --> 40:02.176
Yeah, you were recalling details

40:02.178 --> 40:04.111
like they happened yesterday.

40:04.113 --> 40:05.181
No, no, no.

40:07.817 --> 40:08.949
That's bullshit.

40:08.951 --> 40:10.187
That's not what happened.

40:11.154 --> 40:11.987
Yeah.

40:11.989 --> 40:12.856
We got it on camera.

40:16.326 --> 40:18.829
Imagine yourself in a Hawaiian
breeze.

40:25.802 --> 40:27.604
Why don't I remember this?

40:28.739 --> 40:30.807
That's usually how hypnotism
works.

40:32.175 --> 40:34.076
It might feel like deja vu.

40:39.617 --> 40:42.752
That's usually how hypnotism
works.

40:42.754 --> 40:44.654
It might feel like deja vu.

40:44.656 --> 40:46.589
What the fuck?

40:46.591 --> 40:47.424
Fuck.

41:17.256 --> 41:18.989
This is very generous, but...

41:18.991 --> 41:20.891
It's not about the money.

41:20.893 --> 41:22.360
Of course.

41:22.362 --> 41:23.763
Mr. Fuller understands that.

41:24.631 --> 41:28.068
But you are here, so something
does motivate you.

41:29.269 --> 41:30.902
Let me ask you this:

41:30.904 --> 41:33.073
do you think Mr. Fuller is in it
for the money?

41:35.976 --> 41:39.110
Life after death isn't just a
dream.

41:39.112 --> 41:39.946
It's real.

41:41.614 --> 41:43.014
Legacy.

41:43.016 --> 41:46.418
It's about making a real
difference within our lifetimes.

41:46.420 --> 41:47.788
While we still draw breath.

41:48.856 --> 41:49.757
We need your help.

41:52.793 --> 41:54.829
We've already announced our
launch dates.

41:56.464 --> 41:57.865
What did you have in mind?

41:59.800 --> 42:01.400
We've been following your work
for some time,

42:01.402 --> 42:03.237
and we're impressed.

42:05.506 --> 42:06.705
Oh.

42:06.707 --> 42:07.539
Thanks.

42:07.541 --> 42:08.741
I...

42:08.743 --> 42:10.278
was pretty sure nobody noticed.

42:11.947 --> 42:13.513
A low profile is a smart idea

42:13.515 --> 42:14.950
for a man in your situation.

42:18.387 --> 42:20.989
Don't worry, I have no ethical
stake in this at all.

42:22.257 --> 42:23.458
Neither does Mr. Fuller.

42:24.993 --> 42:26.760
But some friends of his at the
DEA

42:26.762 --> 42:29.462
say they're about a month away
from making their case,

42:29.464 --> 42:31.865
and your picture is hanging up
on a cork board

42:31.867 --> 42:34.404
surrounded by a bunch of
unfriendly Mexicans.

42:35.705 --> 42:38.939
Mr. Fuller wants you to know
that he understands.

42:38.941 --> 42:42.678
Someone you loved was dying of a
terrible, painful disease.

42:44.247 --> 42:45.248
You saw a way.

42:46.416 --> 42:47.250
A way to help.

42:48.485 --> 42:49.752
What choice did you have?

42:50.953 --> 42:52.086
You shouldn't have to live in
the shadow

42:52.088 --> 42:54.655
of that decision for the rest of
your life.

42:54.657 --> 42:56.225
Especially now that she's gone.

43:00.064 --> 43:01.565
How would you like a real lab?

43:02.866 --> 43:04.868
One you wouldn't have to clean
yourself.

43:11.408 --> 43:13.077
No, no, no, I don't think so.

43:17.549 --> 43:18.382
You cheated.

43:20.651 --> 43:22.819
You hacked in and raised the
Zed-axis.

43:22.821 --> 43:23.886
It's not cheating.

43:23.888 --> 43:24.923
It's a workaround.

43:26.124 --> 43:27.323
How is that fun for you?

43:27.325 --> 43:29.027
I get to see behind the curtain.

43:30.529 --> 43:32.795
Organic chemistry, U of T.

43:32.797 --> 43:34.263
You were the hot shot in the
front row,

43:34.265 --> 43:36.833
but you dropped just before
Christmas.

43:36.835 --> 43:38.334
How do you remember that?

43:38.336 --> 43:39.437
We're ready for you.

43:50.249 --> 43:51.715
So far, we've had success

43:51.717 --> 43:54.451
building on a 10-to-one
solution, glycine to GABA.

43:54.453 --> 43:55.886
But our results beyond eight
days

43:55.888 --> 43:58.322
of suspension have been...

43:58.324 --> 43:59.158
embarrassing.

44:00.159 --> 44:01.293
Have you tried-

44:04.630 --> 44:06.498
You can't wasp your formulas

44:06.500 --> 44:07.631
without shutting down the
program.

44:07.633 --> 44:10.101
We're not changing our formulas
on the fly.

44:10.103 --> 44:10.969
One at a time.

44:10.971 --> 44:12.971
Cleaner data and safer trials.

44:12.973 --> 44:14.241
That's a waste of time.

44:15.142 --> 44:17.108
If I could swap his formula now,

44:17.110 --> 44:19.878
I could have his gammas on track
in an hour.

44:19.880 --> 44:21.679
You have got too much cortical
inhibition

44:21.681 --> 44:23.448
going on in this mix.

44:23.450 --> 44:26.751
How long could that brain state
be sustained chemically?

44:26.753 --> 44:31.189
You synthesize as needed, so,
just shy of forever?

44:31.191 --> 44:33.324
As long as you can maintain the
homeostatic functions.

44:33.326 --> 44:35.127
Our formulas were good on paper;

44:35.129 --> 44:37.163
it was just the psychological
side effects of...

44:37.165 --> 44:38.766
Psychology is brain chemistry.

44:40.067 --> 44:41.302
We need to get to work.

44:45.273 --> 44:48.307
Checkers, chess.

44:48.309 --> 44:49.576
I think this one's Pong?

44:49.578 --> 44:52.278
No wonder they can't maintain
engagement.

44:52.280 --> 44:54.315
Yeah, literally bore
them to death.

44:55.216 --> 44:57.049
The point is to keep their
brains engaged

44:57.051 --> 44:58.185
for an indefinite
amount of time,

44:58.187 --> 45:01.188
not flex one muscle over and
over again for decades.

45:01.190 --> 45:02.490
This approach basically
guarantees

45:02.492 --> 45:04.592
that they're insane by time they
show up.

45:04.594 --> 45:07.928
Okay, any given night, your
dreams are essentially

45:07.930 --> 45:12.935
more or less memories of the
days events just replaying,

45:13.302 --> 45:15.068
but with other memories

45:15.070 --> 45:18.573
and more imaginative variations
mixed in, right?

45:18.575 --> 45:21.677
So that's essentially what we
need, but goal-oriented,

45:21.679 --> 45:23.645
so they're not just treading
water.

45:23.647 --> 45:24.480
Yeah.

45:25.549 --> 45:28.716
And you can't recycle the same
content forever.

45:28.718 --> 45:31.687
These guys are supposed to sleep
for who knows how long,

45:31.689 --> 45:33.387
and then show up on an alien
planet and get to work.

45:33.389 --> 45:35.022
They'll need to be sharp.

45:35.024 --> 45:36.324
If you can give me open-ended
programs,

45:36.326 --> 45:37.892
I can maintain the chemistry,

45:37.894 --> 45:40.361
provided your spread the
stimulation across the whole brain.

45:40.363 --> 45:42.631
Feeding checkers into an idle
brain is one thing,

45:42.633 --> 45:45.968
But to create something that
would last indefinitely

45:45.970 --> 45:47.869
is a whole other animal.

45:47.871 --> 45:48.870
That's fine, though.

45:48.872 --> 45:50.739
With these resources I can pipe
them in there.

45:50.741 --> 45:52.741
We just have to focus on
generating content.

45:52.743 --> 45:53.576
Okay, you don't get it, though.

45:53.578 --> 45:55.310
It would have to be something

45:55.312 --> 45:58.180
magnitudes more complex than any
cutting-edge

45:58.182 --> 45:59.483
video game or VR.

46:01.118 --> 46:02.652
Not only does the
brain have to be fooled

46:02.654 --> 46:04.587
by the sights and
sounds of the program,

46:04.589 --> 46:06.489
but it needs the
freedom to try out

46:06.491 --> 46:09.091
new patterns and
combinations at will.

46:09.093 --> 46:11.761
There can't be any buildings you
just cannot enter

46:11.763 --> 46:13.997
or only two types of restaurant.

46:13.999 --> 46:16.600
The program would need to be a
multi-verse of complexity

46:16.602 --> 46:18.835
where anything and everything
could happen.

46:18.837 --> 46:21.437
Then you might get all those
brainwaves firing

46:21.439 --> 46:24.541
like a waking brain for that
long.

46:24.543 --> 46:27.645
Could take years to write
something like that from scratch.

46:27.647 --> 46:29.347
We don't have that kind of time.

46:30.650 --> 46:32.048
Right.

46:32.050 --> 46:33.151
I remember you.

46:34.220 --> 46:35.720
What?

46:35.722 --> 46:37.589
There was this virtual reality
program

46:37.591 --> 46:41.058
that would let criminals serve
out virtual sentences.

46:41.060 --> 46:42.594
It would seem like 10 years
subjectively,

46:42.596 --> 46:44.228
but it took place in a matter of
weeks

46:44.230 --> 46:46.196
at a fraction of the
incarceration costs.

46:46.198 --> 46:47.565
It was huge.

46:47.567 --> 46:50.067
They built prison worlds for the
convicts to occupy.

46:50.069 --> 46:51.636
But lobbyists got it shut down

46:51.638 --> 46:54.004
'cause nobody wants to see their
daughter's murderer

46:54.006 --> 46:56.641
walking free, even if he's a
changed man.

46:56.643 --> 46:58.276
But with this type of cryo-sleep

46:58.278 --> 47:01.179
we can flip the subjective time
dilation.

47:01.181 --> 47:04.051
What seems like weeks is
actually years of clock-time.

47:04.985 --> 47:06.786
If I can steal some of the
architecture

47:06.788 --> 47:09.321
and maybe even
parts of the raw program,

47:09.323 --> 47:10.991
it could be a solid work around.

47:12.527 --> 47:14.459
So they're in jail subjectively
for years,

47:14.461 --> 47:17.496
then when they come out, it's
weeks later?

47:17.498 --> 47:19.364
Seems evil to compress that much
pain

47:19.366 --> 47:21.001
into such a short amount of
time.

47:23.505 --> 47:26.138
You gotta wonder what it'd be
like to be stuck in there.

47:37.985 --> 47:40.319
Did you hear anything I just
said?

47:40.321 --> 47:42.221
No, probably not.

47:42.223 --> 47:43.724
Man, what is up with you lately?

47:43.726 --> 47:45.459
I want to test something out

47:45.461 --> 47:48.895
I'm already pretty, yeah, pretty
confidant about.

47:48.897 --> 47:50.765
What are you testing?

47:50.767 --> 47:51.699
There's gotta be some
things

47:51.701 --> 47:54.134
that it just can't compute.

47:54.136 --> 47:57.170
There's cracks all around us, we
just gloss over them.

47:57.172 --> 47:58.438
I am not following you at all.

47:58.440 --> 47:59.875
I don't give a fuck.

48:12.088 --> 48:14.355
Hey, I'll drive for a bit.

48:14.357 --> 48:16.257
Think you've been working a
little too hard.

48:16.259 --> 48:18.025
You need some time away, man.

48:18.027 --> 48:18.863
Shh.

48:21.866 --> 48:22.700
Shh.

48:25.001 --> 48:25.836
Listen.

48:27.838 --> 48:28.739
Can you hear that?

48:32.510 --> 48:33.309
Shh.

48:35.346 --> 48:36.180
Just listen.

48:38.282 --> 48:39.116
Here it comes.

49:11.183 --> 49:13.485
Where is that coming from?

49:16.488 --> 49:17.989
Where's the train?

49:19.024 --> 49:20.858
There is no train.

49:20.860 --> 49:23.360
There aren't any trains around
for miles.

49:23.362 --> 49:24.462
That's my point.

49:24.464 --> 49:27.465
Wait, where are you going?

49:27.467 --> 49:28.602
I'm leaving you here.

49:30.704 --> 49:31.538
Wait, what?

49:32.506 --> 49:34.038
Hey, hey, hey.

49:34.040 --> 49:34.873
Wait.

49:34.875 --> 49:35.975
You got all my stuff in there!

49:37.511 --> 49:38.512
Where are you going?

49:49.524 --> 49:50.556
I think a good starting point
might be

49:50.558 --> 49:54.059
some of these prisoner
recreation programs.

49:54.061 --> 49:56.328
Prisoners had the option of
doing art,

49:56.330 --> 49:58.296
music, photography, creative
writing.

49:58.298 --> 50:01.235
The modules actually look pretty
complex and task-oriented.

50:02.637 --> 50:05.003
So if you strip away the
prisoner reward point

50:05.005 --> 50:09.543
bullshit thing and just sink 'em
into...

50:09.545 --> 50:11.143
programs where they're forced to
be creative,

50:11.145 --> 50:14.480
maybe we can get the brain
generating its own content.

50:14.482 --> 50:16.550
Their subconscious will be able
to basically dream up

50:16.552 --> 50:19.688
whatever it wants, within the
confines of the program.

50:22.858 --> 50:23.959
What about filmmaking?

50:25.093 --> 50:26.125
I mean, it basically combines

50:26.127 --> 50:28.463
all those artistic elements you
just mentioned.

50:30.666 --> 50:32.866
Yeah, have the user
work on a film.

50:32.868 --> 50:34.602
You just keep on dropping in new
tasks,

50:34.604 --> 50:37.972
pushing back the end-goal back
til it's time to wake up.

50:37.974 --> 50:39.874
Limitless possibilities.

50:39.876 --> 50:42.577
Huge waste of full brain
activity.

50:42.579 --> 50:43.479
That is perfect.

50:45.015 --> 50:46.315
And half my idea.

50:58.295 --> 50:59.997
How did you hear about this
study?

51:02.499 --> 51:03.734
How do you mean, sir?

51:05.101 --> 51:08.938
Like, how did you hear we were
looking for test subjects?

51:08.940 --> 51:10.875
I was ordered to
report here sir.

51:11.809 --> 51:13.274
Ordered by who?

51:13.276 --> 51:15.111
By my commanding officer, sir.

51:18.883 --> 51:20.448
You want to use my program.

51:20.450 --> 51:22.018
I know the copyright reverted
back to you

51:22.020 --> 51:24.186
when the prison program folded.

51:24.188 --> 51:25.791
We want to build upon your work.

51:26.758 --> 51:27.593
Buy it flat out.

51:29.928 --> 51:31.595
How do you plan to avoid neural
degeneration

51:31.597 --> 51:32.496
for over a decade?

51:33.665 --> 51:36.666
Well we all have our trade
secrets now, don't we?

51:36.668 --> 51:37.968
To be honest, it wouldn't be
difficult

51:37.970 --> 51:41.136
to reverse engineer your program
and avoid your copyright,

51:41.138 --> 51:44.373
but it would be much cleaner if
I just buy it outright.

51:44.375 --> 51:45.977
Give me a number.

51:45.979 --> 51:46.813
I want it.

51:47.947 --> 51:48.781
You want it?

51:50.516 --> 51:51.381
Or do you want it?

51:51.383 --> 51:52.550
Everything I've said comes from-

51:52.552 --> 51:53.786
What is it, Mr. Fuller?

51:57.122 --> 51:58.223
I want it.

52:01.426 --> 52:02.827
You'll need a good neurochemist

52:02.829 --> 52:04.095
and one hell of a programmer.

52:04.097 --> 52:05.295
Think you can do it?

52:05.297 --> 52:06.532
Of course we do.

52:16.142 --> 52:17.310
Be my guest.

52:21.782 --> 52:22.616
Well...

52:23.550 --> 52:24.818
I guess I dream about...

52:25.719 --> 52:27.087
what everyone dreams about.

52:28.354 --> 52:29.255
Things, I guess.

52:30.624 --> 52:31.790
Okay, be specific.

52:31.792 --> 52:34.062
What do you and everyone else
dream about?

52:35.030 --> 52:35.864
Jeez.

52:36.965 --> 52:38.099
Stuff, I guess.

52:39.500 --> 52:40.334
Okay.

52:41.435 --> 52:43.270
Like what specifically?

52:44.973 --> 52:46.306
Normal things.

52:47.575 --> 52:48.407
Normal stuff.

52:48.409 --> 52:49.876
So, the same different stuff?

52:49.878 --> 52:52.111
That's the normal stuff.

52:52.113 --> 52:53.278
Exactly.

52:53.280 --> 52:54.346
Okay.

52:54.348 --> 52:55.848
Well, thanks.

52:55.850 --> 52:56.818
We'll be in touch.

52:59.789 --> 53:00.623
Thanks.

53:16.105 --> 53:17.439
My other guy is on break.

53:18.941 --> 53:20.710
But I can get you started.

53:21.678 --> 53:22.679
Please, have a seat.

53:27.184 --> 53:28.616
Thanks.

53:28.618 --> 53:30.217
Have we met?

53:30.219 --> 53:31.387
Hm?

53:33.557 --> 53:35.255
No, that's deja vu.

53:35.257 --> 53:38.292
Sorry, if you can just start
filling that out.

53:38.294 --> 53:39.226
Yeah.

53:39.228 --> 53:40.729
Could you tell me a little about

53:40.731 --> 53:43.767
what I'm signing up for before I
sign up?

53:44.868 --> 53:46.170
It's a computer program.

53:47.304 --> 53:49.205
Well it's like a series of
computer programs,

53:49.207 --> 53:51.175
and we're gonna do stuff to you.

53:52.275 --> 53:53.310
Like, we're gonna...

53:55.445 --> 53:56.681
It's non-invasive.

53:57.749 --> 53:58.748
So this is one of those things

53:58.750 --> 54:00.583
where you program me to kill the
president.

54:00.585 --> 54:01.418
Uh, no.

54:02.820 --> 54:03.654
It's...

54:04.589 --> 54:06.321
We just need you to be ignorant.

54:06.323 --> 54:08.591
Like, we need ignorant people.

54:08.593 --> 54:11.460
Not dumb people, like not you
have to be dumb.

54:11.462 --> 54:13.262
Just, we need the subjects to be
ignorant.

54:13.264 --> 54:16.600
If you, okay, so say you knew
exactly how the program worked

54:16.602 --> 54:18.969
then it might not work on you
the same way.

54:18.971 --> 54:21.104
You'd be cognizant of everything
around you

54:21.106 --> 54:22.706
and it would, the program would
shut down.

54:22.708 --> 54:24.273
I was joking.

54:24.275 --> 54:25.878
Sorry, I got a lot on my mind.

54:27.445 --> 54:30.747
I think your partner does the
interviews for a reason.

54:30.749 --> 54:31.917
What reason?

54:33.987 --> 54:36.988
You don't seem like you have a
lot of experience,

54:36.990 --> 54:38.925
you know, talking to people.

54:40.260 --> 54:41.793
How's that?

54:41.795 --> 54:43.196
Well I have good news for you.

54:44.097 --> 54:45.364
I sold my program to Ray.

54:50.136 --> 54:51.669
I knew I was here
because of my program,

54:51.671 --> 54:54.572
but I didn't know if he was
serious.

54:54.574 --> 54:55.407
Then I saw you.

54:56.475 --> 54:57.743
Me?

54:57.745 --> 55:01.015
Yeah, we haven't met, but I know
who you are.

55:02.382 --> 55:03.816
And you wouldn't be here if you
didn't think

55:03.818 --> 55:06.086
there was some potential for
something great.

55:06.987 --> 55:08.622
His plan is too ambitious.

55:09.990 --> 55:11.123
I would have walked myself,

55:11.125 --> 55:13.025
and then I remembered your
program.

55:14.528 --> 55:15.763
Your code was...

55:16.797 --> 55:18.999
You must have been so young when
you wrote that.

55:20.601 --> 55:23.004
It almost sounds like you're
warming up to me.

55:25.841 --> 55:27.506
Your program is one of the most
beautiful things

55:27.508 --> 55:28.342
I've ever seen.

55:29.678 --> 55:31.544
Why do they even make french
fries anymore,

55:31.546 --> 55:33.014
if onion rings exist?

55:35.050 --> 55:37.217
Your commander volunteer you
too?

55:37.219 --> 55:38.385
Yes and no.

55:39.588 --> 55:41.256
We actually have everyone we
need.

55:42.423 --> 55:44.425
Well, thanks anyway.

56:02.945 --> 56:05.746
Whoa, watch out!

56:05.748 --> 56:06.582
Fuck!

56:07.683 --> 56:08.782
Where am I?!

56:08.784 --> 56:09.718
It's okay, man.

56:09.720 --> 56:10.585
It's cool.

56:10.587 --> 56:12.455
What did you see right before
the end?

56:13.657 --> 56:14.457
It was a...

56:15.759 --> 56:16.660
a light...

56:17.794 --> 56:18.629
was falling.

56:20.731 --> 56:21.830
Again, the program kicked him
out

56:21.832 --> 56:23.899
right before he died, like a
dream.

56:23.901 --> 56:25.233
'Cause it's not in the
programing.

56:25.235 --> 56:26.270
It's a kill screen.

56:27.938 --> 56:28.772
You can go.

56:29.740 --> 56:30.572
You're fine.

56:30.574 --> 56:32.009
Your stuff's in the change room.

56:38.716 --> 56:40.850
So, can you just write in
something then?

56:40.852 --> 56:43.085
Just jump 'em into a new scene?

56:43.087 --> 56:45.021
I could write something in that,
like,

56:45.023 --> 56:47.990
if you die in a module, then you
wake up at

56:47.992 --> 56:49.926
breakfast table, 900 hours, but
we can't.

56:49.928 --> 56:50.826
We need...

56:50.828 --> 56:51.894
That would ruin the illusion.

56:51.896 --> 56:55.298
We need normal waking brain
function, okay?

56:55.300 --> 56:58.702
Not video games, 'cause if you
get crushed by a light,

56:58.704 --> 57:01.605
you don't wake up with fuckin'
orange juice!

57:06.345 --> 57:07.179
Okay.

57:08.446 --> 57:10.314
So your consciousness is running
along

57:10.316 --> 57:12.349
trying to stitch together a
logical sequence,

57:12.351 --> 57:13.750
and we want to keep that
illusion intact,

57:13.752 --> 57:14.651
but what if we could, like,

57:14.653 --> 57:17.421
wipe the slate clean during the
reload?

57:17.423 --> 57:20.390
Reintroduce a hint of
Partridge's cortical suppression,

57:20.392 --> 57:23.227
use some sort of volatile
chemical mediator for memories.

57:23.229 --> 57:25.999
After the reload, when the
person dies or whatever,

57:26.933 --> 57:30.068
you just flush the memories, the
person wakes up

57:30.070 --> 57:31.836
and they just start drinking OJ

57:31.838 --> 57:33.438
because it's right there in
front of them.

57:33.440 --> 57:37.041
What about residual effects from
previous brain states?

57:37.043 --> 57:38.543
Yeah.

57:38.545 --> 57:39.610
The amygdala's flooded,

57:39.612 --> 57:42.780
adrenaline's obviously spiked or
whatever, but...

57:42.782 --> 57:44.883
with a suppressed PFC you might
not even question it.

57:44.885 --> 57:46.484
But if we're suppressing the
PFC,

57:46.486 --> 57:49.054
then we're not getting normal,
waking brain states!

57:51.559 --> 57:54.026
I'm talking about subtle
suppression.

57:54.028 --> 57:55.194
And you only flush the memories

57:55.196 --> 57:57.429
when you absolutely have to
hot-swap the program.

57:57.431 --> 57:59.800
And ultimately, filmmaking isn't
usually fatal.

58:02.003 --> 58:03.869
Every now and then, like in real
life,

58:03.871 --> 58:06.972
they're gonna break routine, and
that involves risk.

58:06.974 --> 58:10.276
And it's not just a
low-probability hypothetical;

58:10.278 --> 58:12.045
it's inevitable, considering how
long

58:12.047 --> 58:13.546
they'll be in the program.

58:13.548 --> 58:15.215
Wipe their memories every once
in a while

58:15.217 --> 58:17.552
and they're bound to notice.

58:29.898 --> 58:31.698
And when a subject notices
discontinuities,

58:31.700 --> 58:34.802
we run the risk that they'll
start noticing the program.

58:34.804 --> 58:37.605
And when that happens, we'll
need to intervene.

58:37.607 --> 58:38.608
Drastically.

59:05.537 --> 59:06.368
Chemically we're in great shape

59:06.370 --> 59:09.137
but we may have underestimated

59:09.139 --> 59:11.275
how complex the
program has to be.

59:12.309 --> 59:14.242
Any frayed edges and it'll fail.

59:14.244 --> 59:16.645
I need every loose end
seamlessly tucked back

59:16.647 --> 59:19.381
into the program before we move
on to human trials.

59:19.383 --> 59:21.951
I want our next trial
to be the last.

59:21.953 --> 59:22.785
How much time?

59:22.787 --> 59:23.686
Not long.

59:23.688 --> 59:24.557
We don't know.

59:25.757 --> 59:27.790
The last report was so
optimistic.

59:27.792 --> 59:29.459
Yeah, we still are optimistic.

59:29.461 --> 59:30.293
But...

59:43.308 --> 59:45.676
Maybe you two should split up,

59:45.678 --> 59:46.544
work separately for a few days.

59:46.546 --> 59:48.979
You're in each others'
heads too much.

59:48.981 --> 59:50.714
Meanwhile, if there's anything
you guys need from me,

59:50.716 --> 59:52.416
I want you to let me know.

59:52.418 --> 59:53.350
Thanks, we will.

59:53.352 --> 59:54.518
All right.

59:54.520 --> 59:56.922
And I know I don't need to
mention our timeline.

01:00:06.365 --> 01:00:07.898
I'm a bit concerned that you
didn't want Mike

01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:11.402
to hear whatever it is you're
about to say.

01:00:11.404 --> 01:00:12.405
Mike is...

01:00:13.373 --> 01:00:15.541
Mike a genius, no doubt.

01:00:15.543 --> 01:00:16.741
Whatever.

01:00:16.743 --> 01:00:21.513
Okay, but he's a perfectionist,
and it's holding us back.

01:00:21.515 --> 01:00:22.981
He wants the program to be

01:00:22.983 --> 01:00:25.250
the perfect recreation of real
life,

01:00:25.252 --> 01:00:27.785
so that you can't experience
anything in the program

01:00:27.787 --> 01:00:30.488
that you wouldn't normally feel
while you're awake.

01:00:30.490 --> 01:00:31.890
Of course.

01:00:31.892 --> 01:00:33.125
It sounds like it makes sense,
right?

01:00:33.127 --> 01:00:37.129
But we never have all the data
in our environment.

01:00:37.131 --> 01:00:38.030
We don't need it.

01:00:38.032 --> 01:00:39.635
Consciousness fills in the gaps.

01:00:40.468 --> 01:00:41.601
The program doesn't have to be
perfect,

01:00:41.603 --> 01:00:44.336
it just has to avoid drawing
attention to itself.

01:00:44.338 --> 01:00:45.639
I know how to do it, okay?

01:00:45.641 --> 01:00:47.306
But Mike is in his head,

01:00:47.308 --> 01:00:49.143
he's too distracted to hear me.

01:00:50.444 --> 01:00:52.747
This sounds like something you
two should agree on.

01:00:53.582 --> 01:00:55.114
Yeah, I know.

01:00:55.116 --> 01:00:56.983
But Mike won't move forward
until he thinks

01:00:56.985 --> 01:00:58.687
the program is absolutely
perfect.

01:00:59.556 --> 01:01:02.524
And look, I need this to work.

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:04.559
Okay?

01:01:04.561 --> 01:01:06.059
He doesn't.

01:01:06.061 --> 01:01:07.761
Let me be blunt.

01:01:07.763 --> 01:01:09.896
We trust Mike's track record and
his judgment

01:01:09.898 --> 01:01:11.668
far more than a former drug
cook.

01:01:13.268 --> 01:01:15.135
That's why I've been hesitant.

01:01:15.137 --> 01:01:17.070
But I'm ready for more testing.

01:01:17.072 --> 01:01:18.271
Now.

01:01:18.273 --> 01:01:20.775
I'm confident that I can
stabilize the interface

01:01:20.777 --> 01:01:21.776
and move the project forward.

01:01:21.778 --> 01:01:24.212
I don't want to waste any more
of your time.

01:01:24.214 --> 01:01:25.880
It's your call.

01:01:25.882 --> 01:01:27.815
I can either sit on my hands and
wait for Mike

01:01:27.817 --> 01:01:29.651
to try and find his inspiration,

01:01:29.653 --> 01:01:33.589
or I can take a couple subjects
on my own

01:01:33.591 --> 01:01:34.991
and get back to work.

01:01:42.999 --> 01:01:44.766
Mike can't even suspect.

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:55.279
I asked Ray how
your trials were going.

01:01:56.914 --> 01:01:58.615
But he wouldn't tell me
anything.

01:01:58.617 --> 01:02:00.717
Gave me attitude for even
asking, like,

01:02:00.719 --> 01:02:01.950
"Take the money and shut up."

01:02:01.952 --> 01:02:04.786
We're cautious for good reason.

01:02:04.788 --> 01:02:07.559
But you have people inside
experiencing things, right?

01:02:09.127 --> 01:02:11.394
Why would I tell you more than
Ray?

01:02:11.396 --> 01:02:13.296
Because...

01:02:13.298 --> 01:02:14.232
you get it.

01:02:15.267 --> 01:02:17.834
What I wanted when I designed
the program.

01:02:17.836 --> 01:02:19.969
You know what it could do,

01:02:19.971 --> 01:02:22.007
what it could mean, and not just
for Ray.

01:02:24.644 --> 01:02:25.542
It's troubling.

01:02:25.544 --> 01:02:28.545
I like talking to you, but I
shouldn't.

01:02:28.547 --> 01:02:30.146
It's distracting.

01:02:30.148 --> 01:02:31.483
I have to do work.

01:02:33.152 --> 01:02:34.787
You gotta take a break some
time.

01:02:35.656 --> 01:02:36.721
Do I?

01:02:36.723 --> 01:02:37.921
Mm-hm.

01:02:37.923 --> 01:02:40.257
Yeah, you can't be on all the
time.

01:02:40.259 --> 01:02:41.327
You gotta...

01:02:42.194 --> 01:02:43.462
let some noise in.

01:02:45.965 --> 01:02:46.799
It's inspiring.

01:02:49.135 --> 01:02:53.971
I don't think I'm built that
way.

01:02:53.973 --> 01:02:54.807
What?

01:03:01.582 --> 01:03:02.550
I bet you are.

01:03:12.694 --> 01:03:15.160
For years, all I ever wanted

01:03:15.162 --> 01:03:16.930
was to see my program working.

01:03:19.567 --> 01:03:22.636
Then it was all over.

01:03:22.638 --> 01:03:23.871
Just like that.

01:03:26.107 --> 01:03:27.942
And I felt like I could die.

01:03:33.848 --> 01:03:37.352
Things were better for a while
after that.

01:03:39.287 --> 01:03:41.055
Not worrying about it all the
time.

01:03:47.764 --> 01:03:49.064
But when Ray called me...

01:03:51.668 --> 01:03:52.868
I felt it again.

01:03:55.504 --> 01:03:56.539
I need to see it.

01:03:58.775 --> 01:04:00.440
I want you to succeed.

01:04:22.666 --> 01:04:25.333
Eric thinks he can solve all our
transition problems

01:04:25.335 --> 01:04:29.339
by just wiping the memories of
the previous module.

01:04:31.508 --> 01:04:33.208
He can do that?

01:04:33.210 --> 01:04:34.076
More or less.

01:04:34.078 --> 01:04:36.713
But no way it's a longterm
solution.

01:04:36.715 --> 01:04:38.149
Memories connect to too much.

01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:43.454
Anything could trigger a memory
that would ruin continuity.

01:04:47.124 --> 01:04:48.392
Things bleed over.

01:04:54.265 --> 01:04:55.099
Well...

01:04:57.603 --> 01:05:00.738
as a fail-safe, it might give
you enough of a buffer

01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:03.175
to put off serious cognitive
dissonance.

01:05:11.918 --> 01:05:15.588
When you make Ray's deadline,
when you're finished,

01:05:17.623 --> 01:05:20.892
I want you to show me how you
did it.

01:05:20.894 --> 01:05:22.128
I need to know.

01:05:24.731 --> 01:05:26.132
When it's over.

01:05:33.941 --> 01:05:35.508
Get back to work.

01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:44.985
Hello?

01:05:58.265 --> 01:06:01.168
So, uh, where's your partner?

01:06:03.504 --> 01:06:05.938
Hopefully getting some sleep.

01:06:05.940 --> 01:06:08.909
He needed a couple days off to
shake off the zombie-brain.

01:06:08.911 --> 01:06:10.445
You can get comfortable there.

01:06:14.583 --> 01:06:15.684
Is it safe?

01:06:17.452 --> 01:06:18.353
Yeah, it's safe.

01:06:22.758 --> 01:06:23.592
Comfortable?

01:06:25.159 --> 01:06:25.995
Sort of.

01:06:27.428 --> 01:06:28.996
Feels weird.

01:06:28.998 --> 01:06:31.266
Something about wires sticking
out of me.

01:06:32.535 --> 01:06:35.538
Yeah that was the one thing that
really pissed off my mom.

01:06:37.540 --> 01:06:40.274
Chemo, confusion, that was all
fine,

01:06:40.276 --> 01:06:42.712
but man, she hated shit sticking
out of her skin.

01:06:45.347 --> 01:06:46.181
It's funny...

01:06:52.221 --> 01:06:53.988
Sorry, I've been up for a while.

01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:54.791
Just...

01:06:56.091 --> 01:06:57.993
try and relax.

01:06:57.995 --> 01:06:59.095
Breathe naturally.

01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:18.581
Okay, Sophie, you should start
to feel

01:07:18.583 --> 01:07:21.216
nice and heavy and sleepy.

01:07:21.218 --> 01:07:23.589
I'd like you to count backwards
from 10 for me.

01:07:26.024 --> 01:07:26.858
10...

01:07:28.492 --> 01:07:29.327
nine...

01:07:30.963 --> 01:07:31.797
six...

01:07:42.373 --> 01:07:43.642
Took the idea from you.

01:07:44.978 --> 01:07:45.878
Six walled.

01:07:46.813 --> 01:07:48.012
So it doesn't bode well for us

01:07:48.014 --> 01:07:50.781
that you figured out it was a
program.

01:07:50.783 --> 01:07:53.416
None of our other tests subjects
figured it out.

01:07:53.418 --> 01:07:54.419
You a lucid dreamer?

01:07:57.824 --> 01:07:59.590
How long have I been under?

01:07:59.592 --> 01:08:01.092
Not long.

01:08:01.094 --> 01:08:02.793
Not long enough.

01:08:02.795 --> 01:08:04.795
And now I find myself wasting
time down here

01:08:04.797 --> 01:08:05.930
trying to make you forget.

01:08:05.932 --> 01:08:06.897
It would really be better for
everyone

01:08:06.899 --> 01:08:08.501
if you just roll with it.

01:08:10.804 --> 01:08:12.169
Why cut me out?

01:08:12.171 --> 01:08:12.971
Cut you out?

01:08:12.973 --> 01:08:14.505
No, I need you.

01:08:14.507 --> 01:08:16.076
But in here for the time being.

01:08:17.044 --> 01:08:19.645
Well, whatever you're doing,
it's not working.

01:08:19.647 --> 01:08:21.312
My memories from the previous
modules

01:08:21.314 --> 01:08:22.279
are starting to bleed over.

01:08:22.281 --> 01:08:23.282
Yeah, I know.

01:08:24.585 --> 01:08:25.417
Annoying.

01:08:26.687 --> 01:08:29.654
But I noticed you don't start
remembering right away.

01:08:29.657 --> 01:08:32.625
You start from scratch every
time.

01:08:32.627 --> 01:08:35.359
So that means I can keep
shifting you around to buy time.

01:08:35.362 --> 01:08:36.698
But it is a fucking hassle.

01:08:38.399 --> 01:08:39.296
Why then?

01:08:39.299 --> 01:08:41.667
Why do you need me out of the
way?

01:08:41.670 --> 01:08:42.502
No.

01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:45.638
No, I don't think I will tell
you.

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:48.107
I don't want you to take it
personally.

01:08:48.109 --> 01:08:49.508
Just trust me.

01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:50.344
It's Sophie.

01:08:51.712 --> 01:08:52.544
Fuck!

01:08:52.546 --> 01:08:53.345
What's going on?

01:09:01.823 --> 01:09:02.658
Come on!

01:09:03.491 --> 01:09:04.660
Mike, come on!

01:09:05.995 --> 01:09:06.827
Open the door, open the door!

01:09:06.828 --> 01:09:07.661
Come on, come on!

01:09:07.662 --> 01:09:09.897
Open, it, open it!

01:09:09.899 --> 01:09:11.067
Open the door!

01:10:57.278 --> 01:10:58.610
Why would you do it?

01:10:58.612 --> 01:10:59.713
I don't...

01:11:02.315 --> 01:11:03.150
Why?

01:11:04.051 --> 01:11:05.152
I don't...

01:11:06.253 --> 01:11:07.886
I don't remember.

01:11:10.124 --> 01:11:11.424
That makes no sense.

01:11:17.164 --> 01:11:17.998
Hey.

01:11:19.133 --> 01:11:20.166
Hey.

01:11:20.168 --> 01:11:21.466
Wake up.

01:11:21.468 --> 01:11:22.902
What?

01:11:22.904 --> 01:11:24.704
Wake up.

01:11:26.675 --> 01:11:28.509
Welcome back.

01:11:30.679 --> 01:11:32.011
It's okay.

01:11:32.013 --> 01:11:33.980
Ease back into it.

01:11:33.982 --> 01:11:38.954
You'll be disoriented for a
while, but that's okay.

01:11:39.187 --> 01:11:40.220
What?

01:11:40.222 --> 01:11:41.353
You had a pretty big shock
there.

01:11:41.355 --> 01:11:43.792
It'll take a little while to
regulate your brain.

01:11:47.563 --> 01:11:48.396
No.

01:11:49.732 --> 01:11:51.232
No?

01:11:51.234 --> 01:11:52.800
No.

01:11:52.802 --> 01:11:54.301
Wait...

01:12:01.811 --> 01:12:06.816
Well, that fucked up.

01:12:38.515 --> 01:12:40.548
Congratulations.

01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:42.752
You can rearrange the program
faster from the inside

01:12:42.754 --> 01:12:44.053
than I can from the outside.

01:12:44.055 --> 01:12:46.188
But it's still my program,

01:12:46.190 --> 01:12:48.456
so wherever you go,
I'm in control.

01:12:48.458 --> 01:12:49.827
I can put you where I want.

01:12:50.929 --> 01:12:53.495
Even if you figure out it's a
program immediately,

01:12:53.497 --> 01:12:54.966
I've got the bird's eye view.

01:12:56.534 --> 01:12:57.535
Then come find me.

01:13:22.562 --> 01:13:23.428
Yeah.

01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:26.199
Hey, you're not answering your
cell.

01:13:28.534 --> 01:13:29.367
Hey!

01:13:29.369 --> 01:13:30.467
What's up?

01:13:30.469 --> 01:13:32.770
Couldn't sleep, and I think I
had a breakthrough.

01:13:32.772 --> 01:13:35.707
Wanted to say it out loud before
I forget.

01:13:35.709 --> 01:13:38.076
So, basically we've been
inputting positive data

01:13:38.078 --> 01:13:40.510
into a blank interface, the
subject,

01:13:40.512 --> 01:13:42.213
which would make sense for a
computer,

01:13:42.215 --> 01:13:44.650
but a human can't sit tight and
wait for the next program

01:13:44.652 --> 01:13:47.653
to run during the gaps, like a
computer can.

01:13:47.655 --> 01:13:49.121
That's why our subjects are
washing out

01:13:49.123 --> 01:13:50.291
during the transitions.

01:13:51.392 --> 01:13:52.791
But what if, before we run
anything,

01:13:52.793 --> 01:13:55.561
we lay down a control track,
like a field of noise

01:13:55.563 --> 01:13:57.596
that constantly runs,
essentially filling in

01:13:57.598 --> 01:14:00.265
any possible gaps that would
come up,

01:14:00.267 --> 01:14:01.499
so when the transitions happen,

01:14:01.501 --> 01:14:04.803
the brain is still receiving
some sort of chaotic signal,

01:14:04.805 --> 01:14:07.272
thus staying active, trying to
sort it out,

01:14:07.274 --> 01:14:09.543
while it waits for the next
program to start.

01:14:10.679 --> 01:14:11.911
It's like in a proper dream
state;

01:14:11.913 --> 01:14:14.381
the mind accepts the next weird
logic of reality

01:14:14.383 --> 01:14:16.249
because it doesn't have empty
time to stop

01:14:16.251 --> 01:14:19.154
and contemplate the previous
weirdness that just happened.

01:14:20.956 --> 01:14:21.788
Yeah.

01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:22.622
Yeah, that sounds great.

01:14:22.624 --> 01:14:23.555
We can try it in the morning.

01:14:23.557 --> 01:14:25.592
No, I'm awake now, I'm heading
over.

01:14:25.594 --> 01:14:26.527
No, it can wait.

01:14:27.496 --> 01:14:28.330
Fuck.

01:14:33.069 --> 01:14:34.235
Shit!

01:14:45.148 --> 01:14:47.014
What the fuck were you thinking?

01:14:47.016 --> 01:14:48.115
Ray signed off on it.

01:14:48.117 --> 01:14:49.050
I don't care!

01:14:49.052 --> 01:14:50.584
You don't test something so
incomplete...

01:14:50.586 --> 01:14:52.353
Look at her, she's comatose!

01:14:52.355 --> 01:14:53.821
It's the same damn program!

01:14:53.823 --> 01:14:55.589
I tweaked one little thing to
mask the memories,

01:14:55.591 --> 01:14:56.925
and none of the other volunteers
went unresponsive.

01:14:56.927 --> 01:14:58.429
She wasn't even a volunteer!

01:15:00.230 --> 01:15:03.498
This is why you don't fuck with
things you don't understand.

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:04.366
Fucking amateur.

01:15:04.368 --> 01:15:05.200
Hey!

01:15:05.202 --> 01:15:06.768
We're on a deadline!

01:15:06.770 --> 01:15:09.004
Okay, I'm not set like you.

01:15:09.006 --> 01:15:12.374
If this doesn't work out for me
I go to prison, at best!

01:15:12.376 --> 01:15:14.645
So I saw a way to jump forward
and I took it.

01:15:17.848 --> 01:15:20.216
How is she not a volunteer?

01:15:20.218 --> 01:15:22.520
Get out of here and let me fix
this.

01:15:24.155 --> 01:15:25.488
We can fix it together.

01:15:25.490 --> 01:15:27.924
I'm not letting you anywhere
near her.

01:15:27.926 --> 01:15:30.126
And now I've got to go to Ray
with this?

01:15:30.128 --> 01:15:32.195
You're off the program.

01:15:32.197 --> 01:15:34.197
Get the fuck outta my lab!

01:15:34.199 --> 01:15:35.431
That's not an option.

01:15:35.433 --> 01:15:37.702
You don't have any say, not any
more.

01:16:00.926 --> 01:16:02.361
I need more time.

01:16:10.337 --> 01:16:11.171
Time.

01:16:13.173 --> 01:16:15.075
Okay, where did you go?

01:16:30.056 --> 01:16:33.595
Scoured every line of code and
came up blank.

01:16:35.229 --> 01:16:38.065
And then I thought about your
warrior game, and it clicked.

01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:40.134
A new axis.

01:16:41.202 --> 01:16:44.071
Imaginary time, or whatever this
is supposed to be.

01:16:45.273 --> 01:16:48.376
That's crafty, but I still found
you.

01:16:50.077 --> 01:16:51.877
Hiding isn't doing anybody any
good.

01:16:51.879 --> 01:16:54.413
It's just costing me valuable
time.

01:16:54.415 --> 01:16:56.183
Then tell me what you want.

01:16:56.185 --> 01:16:58.018
Why are you doing this?

01:16:58.020 --> 01:16:59.755
It's not as sinister you think.

01:17:02.291 --> 01:17:05.091
Sophie's under the same program
you're under.

01:17:05.093 --> 01:17:06.726
But for some reason, she keeps
shutting down

01:17:06.728 --> 01:17:08.096
every module I throw at her.

01:17:09.666 --> 01:17:11.031
Why am I under?

01:17:11.033 --> 01:17:12.334
Because you overreacted.

01:17:14.069 --> 01:17:16.336
You wanted me off the project.

01:17:16.338 --> 01:17:17.871
I needed time to fix things.

01:17:17.873 --> 01:17:19.576
And I can't be off this project.

01:17:24.047 --> 01:17:25.048
It's fixable.

01:17:26.216 --> 01:17:27.448
The program is good.

01:17:27.450 --> 01:17:28.883
It's just not good on her.

01:17:28.885 --> 01:17:29.717
I don't know why.

01:17:29.719 --> 01:17:31.452
She's got something off...

01:17:31.454 --> 01:17:33.187
chemically, I'm not sure what.

01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:34.524
Haven't figured it out yet.

01:17:36.492 --> 01:17:38.261
Patch her into this program
then.

01:17:39.762 --> 01:17:42.633
Look, you can't pull her out
manually, then neither can I.

01:17:43.601 --> 01:17:45.836
But I can control this world,
this program.

01:17:46.971 --> 01:17:48.005
Patch her into me.

01:17:48.973 --> 01:17:50.207
I can make her feel safe.

01:17:51.141 --> 01:17:54.076
I can ease her back up through
each transition,

01:17:54.078 --> 01:17:56.778
one at a time, all the way to
the top.

01:17:56.780 --> 01:18:00.749
Look, I either wake her up, or
make her feel safe

01:18:00.751 --> 01:18:04.253
long enough so that her brain's
firing on all cylinders

01:18:04.255 --> 01:18:06.321
so you can lay down a new
control track.

01:18:06.323 --> 01:18:07.826
But it's still your program.

01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:10.728
She wouldn't even be a player in
your...

01:18:10.730 --> 01:18:13.429
She wouldn't even be a
sub-routine in your code.

01:18:13.431 --> 01:18:14.700
She'd just be a virus.

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:17.800
There's no way to predict the
kind of bleeding

01:18:17.802 --> 01:18:20.303
that would occur between the two
worlds.

01:18:20.305 --> 01:18:21.739
Look, you came to me.

01:18:21.741 --> 01:18:23.676
Even after all you did, you came
to me.

01:18:25.043 --> 01:18:26.579
You don't have a better option.

01:19:00.748 --> 01:19:02.380
How do you feel?

01:19:02.382 --> 01:19:03.982
Let's rock.

01:19:03.984 --> 01:19:05.984
Just make her comfortable,

01:19:05.986 --> 01:19:07.986
so she doesn't turtle every time
something new happens.

01:19:07.988 --> 01:19:11.056
Every time she panics, I have to
alter the program.

01:19:11.058 --> 01:19:12.824
Once you get her into a comfort
zone, try and show her

01:19:12.826 --> 01:19:15.560
how she can manipulate the
program from the inside.

01:19:15.562 --> 01:19:16.463
Like you're doing.

01:19:17.632 --> 01:19:19.364
Where are you gonna start her
from?

01:19:19.366 --> 01:19:21.400
I was thinking of starting her
at your place.

01:19:21.402 --> 01:19:22.234
Where you guys first...

01:19:22.236 --> 01:19:23.436
No, no.

01:19:23.438 --> 01:19:24.773
Start her at my lake house.

01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:27.607
I don't know about that.

01:19:27.609 --> 01:19:29.442
You sort of jerry-rigged it from
the inside,

01:19:29.444 --> 01:19:32.345
so I have no way of knowing how
stable it is.

01:19:32.347 --> 01:19:33.546
It's stable.

01:19:33.548 --> 01:19:35.749
I'd rather have her at an
environment that I can control.

01:19:35.751 --> 01:19:37.483
And her comfort level is
already fucked

01:19:37.485 --> 01:19:39.185
so it's a moot variable.

01:19:39.187 --> 01:19:40.419
Fine.

01:19:40.421 --> 01:19:41.255
You ready?

01:19:42.156 --> 01:19:42.990
Yeah.

01:21:57.866 --> 01:21:58.700
Sophie!

01:22:18.419 --> 01:22:22.858
Sophie.

01:22:26.962 --> 01:22:27.796
It's Mike.

01:22:53.957 --> 01:22:55.057
It's just me.

01:23:09.172 --> 01:23:10.507
Mike!

01:23:14.578 --> 01:23:17.378
I know you're scared.

01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:18.714
But it's okay.

01:23:18.716 --> 01:23:20.719
Where are we?

01:23:25.389 --> 01:23:29.293
Things are too unpredictable, so
let me help.

01:23:30.127 --> 01:23:31.462
Mike.

01:23:32.965 --> 01:23:34.066
Where are we?

01:23:36.167 --> 01:23:37.268
Where are we?

01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:49.548
How can I get to you?

01:23:57.222 --> 01:23:59.224
You're somewhere safe.

01:24:14.540 --> 01:24:16.173
Shh.

01:24:16.175 --> 01:24:17.011
It's okay.

01:24:20.781 --> 01:24:22.513
No, I'm here.

01:24:22.515 --> 01:24:23.381
I'm here now.

01:24:23.383 --> 01:24:24.217
Okay?

01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:27.551
It's okay.

01:24:27.553 --> 01:24:30.554
I'm going to get us out of here.

01:24:30.556 --> 01:24:32.961
I just need you to stay calm.

01:24:35.997 --> 01:24:38.530
I need you to tell me the last
thing you remember

01:24:38.532 --> 01:24:42.200
before everything went crazy on
you.

01:24:42.202 --> 01:24:43.638
Eric called me.

01:24:45.506 --> 01:24:46.340
He...

01:24:49.044 --> 01:24:51.913
He must have found the form I
half filled out.

01:24:54.983 --> 01:24:57.385
I was trying to give you my
number.

01:24:58.854 --> 01:25:01.254
So you went to meet him.

01:25:01.256 --> 01:25:03.092
He was so confident.

01:25:04.627 --> 01:25:06.327
You were already in human
trials.

01:25:07.930 --> 01:25:08.931
I had to know.

01:25:13.803 --> 01:25:15.137
Shh, shh, shh.

01:25:18.674 --> 01:25:19.776
He dropped something!

01:25:21.044 --> 01:25:22.244
When I was on the table.

01:25:23.146 --> 01:25:23.978
Dropped something?

01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:25.146
Some vials.

01:25:25.148 --> 01:25:27.751
It's the last thing I remember.

01:25:28.885 --> 01:25:30.486
After that it's...

01:25:32.622 --> 01:25:33.988
It's all just...

01:25:33.990 --> 01:25:34.825
flashes.

01:25:36.026 --> 01:25:36.860
Oh God!

01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:44.501
It felt like...

01:25:47.171 --> 01:25:48.973
like I was falling out of the
world.

01:25:51.609 --> 01:25:52.744
Like I was dying.

01:25:55.012 --> 01:25:56.013
I tried so hard to hold on with
everything I had.

01:26:00.151 --> 01:26:01.549
You did good.

01:26:01.551 --> 01:26:02.651
Okay?

01:26:02.653 --> 01:26:04.519
You did good.

01:26:04.521 --> 01:26:07.760
But I need you to listen to me
closely.

01:26:09.695 --> 01:26:11.930
We're still in the program.

01:26:13.531 --> 01:26:14.365
No.

01:26:15.533 --> 01:26:16.367
I can't!

01:26:18.269 --> 01:26:19.535
No!

01:26:19.537 --> 01:26:21.504
Listen, listen!

01:26:21.506 --> 01:26:23.108
I'm in control now.

01:26:24.275 --> 01:26:26.109
Okay?

01:26:26.111 --> 01:26:29.179
How do I know what's real?

01:26:29.181 --> 01:26:32.952
The next time you wake up, it
will be real.

01:26:34.988 --> 01:26:36.455
And I'll be there.

01:26:38.457 --> 01:26:43.094
Now I just need you to hang on.

01:26:43.096 --> 01:26:44.028
No!

01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:44.864
No!

01:26:58.746 --> 01:27:00.578
This is it.

01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:01.581
You made it.

01:27:03.516 --> 01:27:04.350
See?

01:27:05.619 --> 01:27:06.452
It's real.

01:27:08.388 --> 01:27:09.389
Thank you.

01:27:42.190 --> 01:27:44.093
Sure you have the right one this
time?

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:46.796
She needs a stabilizer.

01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:53.336
Get it now?

01:27:57.439 --> 01:27:58.908
How long have I been under?

01:27:59.876 --> 01:28:01.474
I figured the best way to keep
you busy

01:28:01.476 --> 01:28:04.111
was to let you think you were in
control.

01:28:04.113 --> 01:28:05.948
But just barely.

01:28:06.983 --> 01:28:08.817
From what point though?

01:28:08.819 --> 01:28:10.384
Oh, I was never under.

01:28:10.386 --> 01:28:13.554
You've been tricking and
resetting a program of me,

01:28:13.556 --> 01:28:15.891
a digital me who thinks he's
making a film,

01:28:15.893 --> 01:28:18.727
and forgetting things,
and trapped.

01:28:18.729 --> 01:28:21.698
You've been playing in my
sandbox while I fix your mistake.

01:28:23.967 --> 01:28:24.866
She's okay.

01:28:24.868 --> 01:28:26.103
I just pulled her out.

01:28:27.403 --> 01:28:28.471
So what now?

01:28:30.340 --> 01:28:31.676
Why am I still under?

01:28:52.596 --> 01:28:53.530
I'm okay.

01:28:55.466 --> 01:28:56.268
Good.

01:29:01.407 --> 01:29:03.106
We'll call you back.

01:29:03.108 --> 01:29:04.608
It's done.

01:29:04.610 --> 01:29:05.945
Minus a few tweaks.

01:29:11.283 --> 01:29:12.382
Sophie?

01:29:12.384 --> 01:29:15.752
Human error, on Eric's part.

01:29:15.754 --> 01:29:17.955
He got sloppy.

01:29:17.957 --> 01:29:18.924
Overworked maybe.

01:29:27.033 --> 01:29:29.903
She's been through a lot, but
she'll be fine.

01:29:31.537 --> 01:29:33.638
What about longterm forecasts?

01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:35.440
Eric just passed day 10.

01:29:35.442 --> 01:29:37.208
All the extrapolations look
perfect.

01:29:37.210 --> 01:29:39.509
He had to brainstorm, keep the
fake Mike busy,

01:29:39.511 --> 01:29:41.813
introduce new realities every
time

01:29:41.815 --> 01:29:43.315
my digital self caught on.

01:29:43.317 --> 01:29:44.683
Our people are going to look
over your data

01:29:44.685 --> 01:29:46.618
in the next four hours.

01:29:46.620 --> 01:29:47.455
Be available.

01:29:49.323 --> 01:29:50.756
Look, I don't know what you have
on Eric,

01:29:50.758 --> 01:29:52.791
and you probably want to send
him up river,

01:29:52.793 --> 01:29:55.629
but I still have some use for
him.

01:29:58.432 --> 01:29:59.667
You're going, aren't you?

01:30:01.002 --> 01:30:02.603
You're making the trip yourself.

01:30:03.503 --> 01:30:05.572
I wouldn't miss it for the
world.

01:30:06.607 --> 01:30:09.543
Guess that'll probably mean a
bit of a promotion for you.

01:30:11.545 --> 01:30:12.513
Get back to work.

01:30:31.968 --> 01:30:33.803
Sophie's fine, if you're
wondering.

01:30:36.773 --> 01:30:38.205
Thank you.

01:30:38.207 --> 01:30:39.340
It was a clumsy mistake.

01:30:39.342 --> 01:30:41.742
You injected her
with the wrong vial.

01:30:41.744 --> 01:30:43.177
The wrong vial?

01:30:43.179 --> 01:30:44.378
We're up and running here,

01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:48.449
just a few bugs to work out,
some high-stress scenarios.

01:30:48.451 --> 01:30:50.718
Gotta lock those down.

01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:52.787
Okay.

01:30:52.789 --> 01:30:53.687
Unhook me.

01:30:53.689 --> 01:30:55.359
Just lay back down.

01:31:38.403 --> 01:31:39.237
Mom?
