00:02.400 --> 00:03.594
Why are people surprised...

00:05.120 --> 00:07.395
...when someone
gets hit with a golf ball?

00:07.560 --> 00:09.312
Have you watched
the tournaments on TV?

00:09.480 --> 00:12.358
You got 600 people
crowding around a hole that big...

00:12.520 --> 00:14.397
...and no one believes it
when a Titleist...

00:14.560 --> 00:16.312
...bounces off someone's coconut.

00:16.480 --> 00:19.995
You know, you throw a rock into
a crowd, that's considered terrorism.

00:20.160 --> 00:24.438
But if you have a nice follow-through,
you know, that's golf.

00:24.880 --> 00:26.996
I'm always impressed
with the golf cameraman...

00:27.160 --> 00:30.948
...whose job it is to follow the golf ball
when it's in the sky.

00:31.120 --> 00:34.237
It's a little white ball doing 100 miles
an hour on a white background.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.595
"l got it. I lost it. I got it. I lost it."

00:36.760 --> 00:39.320
Why bother? Aim the camera
at the sky. Aim it at the ground.

00:39.480 --> 00:41.391
Take a ball out of your pocket.
Throw it down.

00:41.560 --> 00:43.755
Who's gonna know
where the hell it came from?

00:48.000 --> 00:49.752
How did you lock your keys
in your car?

00:49.920 --> 00:51.512
How? Because I'm an idiot.

00:52.960 --> 00:54.996
-Why didn't you get a locksmith?
-I was going to.

00:55.160 --> 00:58.709
Then I found out the Auto Club has
free locksmith service, so I signed up.

00:58.880 --> 01:01.440
Just waiting
for the membership to kick in.

01:02.880 --> 01:05.678
How long has your car been sitting
in the Yankee parking lot?

01:06.040 --> 01:08.429
I don't know. About three days.

01:11.400 --> 01:12.958
Hello, boys.

01:13.560 --> 01:15.869
-You're not playing golf?
-Yes, indeed.

01:16.040 --> 01:18.873
Calendar says winter,
but the gods of spring are out.

01:19.040 --> 01:21.873
-And the course is open?
-No, no.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.390
I sneak in with Stan the Caddy.
We go through the caddies' entrance.

01:26.560 --> 01:28.312
-No kidding.
-I'll tell you something else.

01:28.480 --> 01:32.075
Stan's advice has transformed
my game. He's never wrong.

01:32.240 --> 01:36.518
He thinks eventually I'll have a shot
at making it big on the Senior Tour.

01:36.680 --> 01:37.999
Oh, that's my dream, Jerry.

01:38.160 --> 01:42.119
-Really, you're getting that good?
-Oh, I'm the real deal.

01:43.920 --> 01:47.037
Yeah, here, Stan. In here.
There he is.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.760
Jerry, George, this is Stan the Caddy.

01:49.920 --> 01:51.319
-How you doing?
-Hi.

01:51.480 --> 01:52.469
Nice to meet you.

01:52.640 --> 01:54.312
-Ready to hit the links?
-You betcha.

01:56.520 --> 01:59.273
-What are those, cotton pants?
-Yeah, yeah.

01:59.440 --> 02:00.634
What, is it too cold out?

02:01.640 --> 02:04.029
Here's what you do.
You bring a lightweight jacket.

02:04.200 --> 02:07.112
That way, the sun comes out,
you play the jacket off the sweater.

02:07.280 --> 02:10.157
Oh, that makes sense.
That's a good call, Stan.

02:10.320 --> 02:11.753
All right. We'll see you later.

02:11.920 --> 02:13.911
-Yeah, we'll see you.
-See you.

02:15.800 --> 02:17.916
-Stan the Caddy.
-Stan the Caddy.

02:19.840 --> 02:20.989
Elaine?

02:22.640 --> 02:23.959
Hi.

02:24.120 --> 02:27.749
Oh, great. It's the braless wonder.

02:27.920 --> 02:29.592
Who does she think she's kidding?

02:29.760 --> 02:32.274
Look at her,
she's totally out of control.

02:32.440 --> 02:35.113
I was thinking, "That woman
looks like Elaine Benes."

02:35.280 --> 02:37.748
Yeah. What have you been up to?

02:37.920 --> 02:40.559
-Just been hanging out.
-I see.

02:40.720 --> 02:42.950
Listen, I'm having a birthday party
tomorrow evening.

02:43.120 --> 02:45.588
-I'd love it if you came by.
-Oh, tomorrow.

02:45.760 --> 02:47.398
-I don't know if I can.
-No?

02:47.560 --> 02:52.395
-No, I'm just really, really busy.
-Oh, that's too bad.

02:52.560 --> 02:54.471
Well, I hope you can
get me a gift anyway.

03:00.360 --> 03:02.237
-George.
-Mr. Wilhelm.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.434
I'm sorry to interrupt you,
but Mr. Steinbrenner and l...

03:05.600 --> 03:08.637
...want you to know we appreciate
all the hours you've been putting in.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.836
Oh, and confidentially...

03:11.000 --> 03:14.675
...Sozonkel, assistant to the general
manager, hasn't been working out...

03:14.840 --> 03:17.149
...and the boss thinks
you're the man for the job.

03:17.320 --> 03:19.754
So keep it under your hat.

03:24.760 --> 03:27.672
Assistant to the general manager!
Do you know what that means?

03:27.840 --> 03:30.070
He could be asking my advice
on trades.

03:30.240 --> 03:32.470
Trades, Jerry. I'm a heartbeat away.

03:33.600 --> 03:36.068
That's a hell of an organization
they're running up there.

03:36.920 --> 03:40.230
I can't understand why they haven't
won a pennant in 15 years.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.834
And it is all because of that car.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.833
See, Steinbrenner is, like,
the first guy in at the crack of dawn.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.594
He sees my car.
He figures I'm the first guy in.

03:48.760 --> 03:51.558
Then the last person to leave
is Wilhelm.

03:51.720 --> 03:54.473
He sees my car. He figures
I'm burning the midnight oil.

03:54.640 --> 03:57.438
Between the two of them, they
think I'm working an 18-hour day.

03:59.280 --> 04:02.795
Locking your keys in your car is
the best career move you ever made.

04:03.520 --> 04:05.238
-Hey.
-Hey. How you doing?

04:05.400 --> 04:07.755
-Better now.
-Yeah? What happened?

04:07.920 --> 04:10.514
-You know Sue Ellen Mischke?
-Sue Ellen Mischke?

04:10.680 --> 04:12.671
Yeah, the woman I grew up with
in Maryland.

04:12.840 --> 04:15.070
-She moved here last year.
-Sounds familiar.

04:15.240 --> 04:17.800
The heiress to the
Oh Henry! candy-bar fortune?

04:17.959 --> 04:20.428
-You mentioned her.
-Yes. I ran into her today.

04:20.800 --> 04:25.430
This woman has never, not once ever,
as long as I have known her...

04:25.600 --> 04:27.318
...worn a bra.

04:27.480 --> 04:30.040
-That is shameless.
-Well, she's disgusting. She's a pig.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.430
-There's no reason. That's wrong.
-The woman's a pig.

04:32.600 --> 04:34.556
-It's rude.
-All right. There's no point.

04:34.720 --> 04:37.632
-Come on. Come on. We're sorry.
-We're only kidding.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.109
You don't understand.
See, she hasn't changed at all.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.874
She stole my boyfriend
when I was in high school.

04:43.040 --> 04:45.679
I was at this party, and I was
dating this really cute guy.

04:45.840 --> 04:47.512
His name was
Tom Cosley, by the way.

04:47.680 --> 04:50.478
And she goes walking by
in this little floozy outfit...

04:50.640 --> 04:52.710
...and he follows her
right out the door.

04:54.040 --> 04:56.156
She's your Lex Luthor.

04:56.800 --> 05:01.237
Her birthday's coming up, see?
So I decided to get her a little present.

05:01.400 --> 05:03.960
-What are you gonna get her?
-A very traditional...

05:04.120 --> 05:06.111
...a very supportive...

05:06.280 --> 05:07.998
...brassiere.

05:08.720 --> 05:12.554
-There's nothing subtle about that.
-No, no, she might just think it's a gift.

05:12.720 --> 05:15.439
Have I ever bought you
a jockstrap as a gift?

05:18.520 --> 05:20.158
Hey.

05:20.800 --> 05:23.268
What are you doing here?
Aren't you supposed to be at work?

05:23.440 --> 05:25.749
I'm thinking of leaving town
with Susan for a few days.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.273
Her parents rebuilt the cabin.

05:28.760 --> 05:30.273
So you're just taking off from work?

05:30.440 --> 05:33.591
Yeah, well, they won't know.
I got the car there.

05:34.440 --> 05:37.591
Is this a good idea, with you being
on the verge of this big promotion?

05:37.760 --> 05:41.230
My presence in that office
can only hurt my chances.

05:43.520 --> 05:46.034
Sue Ellen Mischke to see you.

05:46.200 --> 05:48.475
Sue Ellen Mischke?

05:49.000 --> 05:51.195
All right. Send her in.

05:53.160 --> 05:54.991
Hi, Elaine.

05:55.200 --> 05:56.918
Hello.

05:57.080 --> 05:58.308
I was in the neighbourhood...

05:58.480 --> 06:01.552
...so I thought I'd stop in
and thank you for your lovely gift.

06:02.360 --> 06:06.239
Oh, you're welcome.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.231
Is anything wrong?

06:08.560 --> 06:11.074
Well, Sue Ellen, it's....

06:11.240 --> 06:13.515
It's not a top.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.033
It's a bra.

06:15.600 --> 06:16.874
Oh, I know.

06:17.040 --> 06:19.110
Thanks again.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.989
This is the life, isn't it, huh, kid?

06:25.160 --> 06:28.072
-You wanna check out a swap meet?
-Yeah, maybe.

06:28.240 --> 06:30.435
-Where'd you get that?
-lt was on the windshield...

06:30.600 --> 06:33.068
...when we came out
of that rest stop.

06:37.880 --> 06:39.632
-Hello.
-Hey, hey, it's George.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.438
-I need a favour.
-What's going on?

06:41.600 --> 06:44.353
I just remembered. There's a
restaurant near Yankee stadium...

06:44.520 --> 06:46.670
-...that puts fliers on all the cars.
-Yeah, so?

06:46.840 --> 06:50.515
This is what you gotta do. Go to the
parking lot, take the fliers off my car.

06:50.680 --> 06:53.319
Last time you had me throwing
bread up three floors to you.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.072
Now you want me
to go to the Bronx...

06:55.240 --> 06:57.549
...take fliers off your car.
Where does it end?

06:57.720 --> 07:01.872
All right, fine. I'll drive the three hours
each way and take them off myself.

07:02.040 --> 07:04.156
All right. I'll do it.

07:04.680 --> 07:06.193
-Hey, what are you up to?
-Nothing.

07:06.360 --> 07:08.794
You wanna go to the Bronx
and see if there's fliers...

07:08.960 --> 07:10.552
-...on George's car?
-Sure.

07:12.560 --> 07:15.279
-I could have said just about anything.
-Yeah.

07:23.680 --> 07:26.831
Oh, man, look at this mess.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.991
You know what will happen
if they see this?

07:29.160 --> 07:30.388
What are we gonna do?

07:30.560 --> 07:32.869
-I don't know.
-Well, we gotta get it washed.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.355
Oh, the keys are locked inside.

07:38.600 --> 07:40.318
Wait a second.

07:40.480 --> 07:44.155
-What are you gonna do?
-I'll just snag the lock with this.

07:44.560 --> 07:46.596
There we go.

07:47.360 --> 07:49.715
This is quite a life I lead here.

07:53.480 --> 07:56.392
-George has to be happy about this.
-Yeah, yeah.

07:57.120 --> 07:59.429
Oh, my God, Kramer,
is that woman just wearing a bra?

07:59.920 --> 08:01.797
Oh, mama.

08:03.280 --> 08:04.679
Kramer!

08:10.880 --> 08:12.552
My God, are you okay?

08:12.720 --> 08:14.790
I got a cut on my head
and I banged my shoulder.

08:14.960 --> 08:18.475
I guess I have to bring his car back up
to the stadium. If it can make it.

08:18.640 --> 08:21.200
-So how did this happen?
-He was staring at some woman.

08:21.360 --> 08:23.828
Well, I couldn't help it.
You saw what she was wearing.

08:24.680 --> 08:26.557
-What woman?
-There was a beautiful woman...

08:26.720 --> 08:28.631
...walking down the street
wearing just a bra.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.950
I can't get that image
out of my mind.

08:32.320 --> 08:34.754
-Oh, my God.
-What?

08:34.919 --> 08:37.912
-Was it a tall woman in a black blazer?
-Yeah.

08:39.640 --> 08:42.154
-That's Sue Ellen Mischke.
-Sue Ellen Mischke?

08:42.320 --> 08:46.359
That's the bra I gave her.
She's wearing it as a top.

08:47.040 --> 08:50.157
A woman is walking around in broad
daylight with nothing but a bra on.

08:50.320 --> 08:52.959
She's a menace to society.

08:53.520 --> 08:55.875
Hey, you know, my arm really hurts.

08:56.320 --> 08:58.390
I wonder if it's gonna affect
my golf swing.

09:02.920 --> 09:04.876
I got your message.
How's the shoulder?

09:05.040 --> 09:08.510
-It's my left arm. I can't swing it.
-Oh, no, not the left arm!

09:08.680 --> 09:10.557
What happens if I can't play
like I was?

09:10.720 --> 09:13.029
What about the tour
and all my dreams?

09:14.480 --> 09:15.799
I got it!

09:15.960 --> 09:17.518
Let's sue her.

09:17.680 --> 09:20.240
-Sue her?
-Yeah, she's loaded.

09:20.400 --> 09:22.675
She's the heiress to the
Oh Henry! candy-bar fortune.

09:22.840 --> 09:25.195
I can't. I learned my lesson
from that coffee company.

09:25.360 --> 09:26.998
Kramer, listen to me.

09:27.160 --> 09:29.594
Listen. This is
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

09:29.760 --> 09:31.113
Your dreams have been shattered.

09:31.280 --> 09:33.271
Somebody's gotta be
held accountable.

09:33.440 --> 09:36.796
Come on. We'll take her
for every penny she's got.

09:38.760 --> 09:40.830
What do you think, Stan?

09:41.640 --> 09:43.995
Let's go for the green.

09:44.520 --> 09:46.272
You know a good lawyer?

09:48.080 --> 09:49.354
So you're driving in the car.

09:49.520 --> 09:52.114
You're with your friend,
minding your own business.

09:52.280 --> 09:54.032
-Then what happened?
-We saw this woman...

09:54.200 --> 09:56.270
...and she was wearing a bra
with no top.

09:56.440 --> 09:58.396
No top? She didn't have a top on?

09:58.560 --> 10:01.916
Yeah, so I got distracted
and I crashed the car.

10:02.080 --> 10:03.559
How would you describe
this woman?

10:03.720 --> 10:05.278
Would you say she was attractive?

10:05.760 --> 10:08.149
-Oh, yeah.
-So we got an attractive woman...

10:08.320 --> 10:11.198
...wearing a bra, no top,
walking around in broad daylight.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.952
She's flouting society's conventions.

10:13.120 --> 10:15.509
-She was flouting.
-That's totally inappropriate.

10:15.680 --> 10:19.195
It's lewd, lascivious, salacious,
outrageous.

10:19.360 --> 10:20.679
It was outrageous.

10:20.840 --> 10:23.513
And she's the heir to
the Oh Henry! candy-bar fortune.

10:24.120 --> 10:26.031
Could you repeat that?

10:26.200 --> 10:29.112
I said, she's the heir to
the Oh Henry! candy-bar fortune.

10:29.280 --> 10:30.952
Oh Henry!?

10:31.320 --> 10:33.356
That's one of our
top-selling candy bars.

10:33.520 --> 10:35.909
It's got chocolate, peanuts, nougat.

10:36.080 --> 10:38.958
It's delicious, scrumptious,
outstanding.

10:39.120 --> 10:41.350
-Have you been to a doctor?
-No.

10:41.520 --> 10:45.593
Suzy, call Dr. Bison.
Set up an appointment for Mr. Kramer.

10:45.760 --> 10:47.955
Tell him it's for me.

10:48.640 --> 10:51.029
So, what do you think, Jackie?
I mean, we got a case?

10:51.520 --> 10:52.953
Like taking candy from a baby.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.152
I think I got it. How about this?

11:00.320 --> 11:02.390
We trade Jim Leyritz
and Bernie Williams...

11:02.560 --> 11:04.391
...for Barry Bonds.
What do you think?

11:04.560 --> 11:06.755
Then I have Griffey and
Bonds in the same outfield.

11:06.920 --> 11:08.319
Now you got a team.

11:08.480 --> 11:11.392
I don't know, George.
I'm still worried about this car thing.

11:11.560 --> 11:14.393
-Would you stop worrying?
-Well, what about the fliers?

11:14.560 --> 11:19.350
Jerry took the fliers off the car.
I got the whole thing covered.

11:43.040 --> 11:44.553
Come in.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.399
-Wilhelm.
-Mr. Steinbrenner...

11:46.560 --> 11:48.790
...I am very concerned about
George Costanza.

11:48.960 --> 11:51.520
-How about a "good morning"?
-Yes, sir. Good morning, sir.

11:51.680 --> 11:52.669
Good morning, Wilhelm.

11:52.840 --> 11:56.355
Anyway, his car is in the parking lot,
the front end is bashed in...

11:56.520 --> 11:59.239
...and there's blood in the car,
and we can't find him anywhere.

11:59.400 --> 12:02.312
Obviously, he was in some sort of
a terrible car accident...

12:02.480 --> 12:05.597
...and trouper that he is,
he tried to make it into work, sir.

12:05.760 --> 12:07.830
Wilhelm, listen to me.
I want the stadium scoured.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.558
He could be bleeding in the bullpen.

12:09.720 --> 12:12.314
Everyone on alert.
Check hospitals, clinics, shelters.

12:12.480 --> 12:14.198
-We've gotta find that kid.
-Yes, sir.

12:14.360 --> 12:15.918
-We must find George.
-Yes, sir.

12:16.080 --> 12:18.071
-Find him, Wilhelm.
-Yes, sir.

12:25.440 --> 12:27.829
Excuse me. Do you know
the gentleman across the hall?

12:29.600 --> 12:31.033
Yes. Yes, I do.

12:31.520 --> 12:33.272
Do you know if he'll
be back anytime soon?

12:33.840 --> 12:36.115
No, I don't.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.675
Is there something
I can help you with?

12:38.840 --> 12:41.115
No, I really just needed
to speak with him.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.830
Well, you can wait for him in here
if you like.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.909
Well, maybe I will.

12:48.080 --> 12:50.310
-lf you don't mind.
-No, no, not at all.

12:50.480 --> 12:52.391
-Thanks.
-I'm Jerry Seinfeld.

12:54.920 --> 12:57.992
What is with these people?
All day long. Come in. Come in.

13:01.200 --> 13:03.509
Mr. Steinbrenner, you know,
we've searched everywhere.

13:03.680 --> 13:05.033
There's no sign of him.

13:05.200 --> 13:08.476
Not even anyone who
remotely fits his description, sir.

13:08.640 --> 13:10.198
Oh, my God.

13:10.360 --> 13:12.351
-Do you know what this means?
-What, sir?

13:12.520 --> 13:15.159
He's dead. Costanza's dead.

13:15.320 --> 13:18.073
-No, no, sir. You see--
-As quickly as he came, he's gone.

13:18.240 --> 13:20.435
The poor little guy.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.830
Easy, Big Stein, get it together.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.228
-Okay, Wilhelm.
-Yes, sir.

13:24.400 --> 13:27.358
Find out where his parents live.
I'm gonna personally notify them.

13:27.520 --> 13:30.671
And line up some candidates
to fill that assistant position.

13:30.840 --> 13:32.398
-Yes, sir.
-We can't grieve forever.

13:32.560 --> 13:33.834
Gotta get back to business.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.275
-Back to business, Wilhelm.
-Yes, sir.

13:38.880 --> 13:41.155
Well, buddy, he's taking the case.

13:41.320 --> 13:45.199
Jackie Chiles is right on it.
Right on it. He's all over it.

13:45.800 --> 13:48.473
-Oh, really?
-Why? What's wrong? Come on.

13:48.640 --> 13:51.359
I don't know. So the woman was
walking around in a bra.

13:51.520 --> 13:53.954
I mean, it's no big deal.
You're still driving.

13:54.120 --> 13:56.190
You should have been
watching the road.

13:56.360 --> 13:58.430
Well, your attitude
has certainly changed.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.113
I don't think it's changed.

14:00.280 --> 14:01.872
Listen, I'm gonna need you
to testify.

14:02.040 --> 14:04.793
-I don't know if I can.
-Jerry, you gotta testify.

14:04.960 --> 14:06.393
-Kramer, I don't think l--
-Listen.

14:06.560 --> 14:10.792
This is a million dollars we're talking
about, Jerry. This is the big league.

14:10.960 --> 14:15.795
-I need you on my team, Jerry.
-Well, I'm not sure how I feel about it.

14:17.080 --> 14:19.389
All right, what's gotten into you?
What's happened?

14:20.440 --> 14:22.715
Nothing's happened.

14:28.600 --> 14:29.999
What's this?

14:30.160 --> 14:34.039
-No, wait a second. Wait a second.
-Oh, I see. Yes.

14:34.200 --> 14:37.112
Little Miss Candy Bar
paid a visit, didn't she?

14:37.280 --> 14:40.716
-Kramer, it is not what you think.
-I know what I think.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.519
I think you're gaga over this dame.

14:43.680 --> 14:45.910
She's twisted you around
her little finger...

14:46.080 --> 14:48.992
...and now you're willing to sell
me and Elaine...

14:49.160 --> 14:51.833
...and whoever else you have to
right down the river.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.399
And what about you?

14:53.560 --> 14:56.279
Trying to bilk an innocent bystander
out of a family fortune...

14:56.440 --> 14:59.830
...built on sweat and toil manufacturing
quality Oh Henry! candy bars...

15:00.000 --> 15:02.878
-...for honest, hardworking Americans.
-You're just out for sex!

15:03.040 --> 15:04.268
You're just out for money!

15:12.520 --> 15:14.556
-Mrs. Costanza?
-Yes.

15:14.720 --> 15:15.994
My name is George Steinbrenner.

15:16.160 --> 15:19.197
I'm afraid I have some very sad news
about your son.

15:20.480 --> 15:24.951
I can't believe it. He was so young.
How could this have happened?

15:25.120 --> 15:26.519
He'd been logging heavy hours.

15:26.680 --> 15:29.831
First one in, last one to leave.
The kid was a human dynamo.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.719
Are you sure you're talking
about George?

15:32.880 --> 15:34.313
You are Mr. and Mrs. Costanza?

15:34.800 --> 15:37.268
What the hell did you
trade Jay Buhner for?

15:37.440 --> 15:40.955
He had 30 home runs
and over 100 RBls last year.

15:41.120 --> 15:42.872
He's got a rocket for an arm.

15:43.040 --> 15:45.554
You don't know what the hell
you're doing!

15:45.720 --> 15:47.870
Buhner was a good prospect.
No question about it.

15:48.040 --> 15:49.996
But my baseball people
loved Ken Phelps' bat.

15:50.160 --> 15:51.593
They kept saying, "Ken Phelps."

15:52.000 --> 15:53.718
I'm not here. Leave a message.

15:53.880 --> 15:55.313
Jerry, it's Frank Costanza.

15:55.520 --> 15:59.115
Mr. Steinbrenner's here.
George is dead. Call me back.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.677
-Hello?
-Hey, it's George.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.398
-Where have you been?
-What?

16:08.560 --> 16:10.551
I just got a bizarre message
from your father.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.950
Steinbrenner's at your house.
They think you're dead.

16:13.120 --> 16:15.509
-Dead?
-And we had an accident with the car.

16:15.680 --> 16:17.716
It's a little crumpled.

16:17.880 --> 16:19.711
-My car's a little crumpled?
-Yeah, yeah.

16:19.880 --> 16:22.394
I didn't know what to do,
so I put it back at the stadium.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.119
Wait a second. Wait a second.

16:24.280 --> 16:28.193
They saw the car and the blood, that's
why Steinbrenner thinks you're dead.

16:28.360 --> 16:31.511
I gotta head back right away.
I gotta figure something out here.

16:31.680 --> 16:34.638
-You gotta call your parents.
-I can't. Steinbrenner might be there.

16:34.800 --> 16:37.268
Aren't you gonna tell your parents
you're still alive?

16:37.440 --> 16:38.475
They could use the break.

16:43.960 --> 16:46.235
Elaine, do you see this?

16:47.280 --> 16:49.111
Do you see what I'm holding
in my hands?

16:49.480 --> 16:51.038
Yeah, it's a bra.

16:51.800 --> 16:55.713
I saw a woman in our hallway
wearing one of these as a top.

16:55.880 --> 16:57.472
What exquisite beauty.

16:57.640 --> 16:59.676
I ran down the hallway
to talk to her...

16:59.840 --> 17:03.150
...but the elevator door closed.
It was not to be.

17:03.320 --> 17:05.390
Perhaps our paths
will cross again someday.

17:06.520 --> 17:07.873
What is this all about?

17:08.040 --> 17:11.510
I want to market this item as
a new direction in women's fashion.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.990
We're gonna sell this as a top.

17:14.160 --> 17:16.992
Here's the angle. Zelda Fitzgerald...

17:17.160 --> 17:18.354
...somebody of the '20s...

17:18.520 --> 17:22.354
...wearing this at wild parties,
driving all the men crazy.

17:22.760 --> 17:25.035
Have it on my desk
by the end of the week.

17:29.520 --> 17:31.192
Come in. Come in.

17:32.080 --> 17:33.274
Mr. Steinbrenner.

17:35.360 --> 17:36.588
Is it you?

17:37.240 --> 17:39.390
Yeah, it's me, sir.

17:39.560 --> 17:41.835
It's been a harrowing few days.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.629
After the car accident,
I crawled into a ditch.

17:45.800 --> 17:47.438
I managed to survive...

17:47.600 --> 17:52.151
...on grubs and puddle water until a
kindly old gentleman picked me up.

17:52.320 --> 17:55.039
Grubs, huh? Gotta admit,
I never tasted one of those.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.838
Anyway, as I was lying
in the puddle...

17:57.000 --> 17:59.912
...I think I may have found a way
for us to get Bonds and Griffey...

18:00.080 --> 18:01.672
...and we wouldn't
give up that much.

18:01.840 --> 18:05.116
Don't tell it to me. Tell it to the
new assistant to the general manager.

18:05.280 --> 18:06.679
I didn't get the job?

18:06.840 --> 18:09.957
You were dead. We couldn't sit on
our hands. We had to make a move.

18:10.160 --> 18:11.878
But you still have your old job.

18:12.040 --> 18:14.156
Of course we'll have to
dock the time you missed.

18:14.320 --> 18:15.594
We're running a ball club.

18:15.760 --> 18:19.196
If I give special treatment to you,
everyone will want it. Next, it's chaos.

18:19.360 --> 18:22.557
And I can tell you this; Chaos does
not work for the New York Yankees.

18:22.720 --> 18:24.756
Not as long
as I'm running the show!

18:26.240 --> 18:29.198
So it was the meeting on the street
that prompted you to buy the bra.

18:29.360 --> 18:32.079
-Would you say that was correct?
-Yes.

18:32.240 --> 18:33.912
Yes. That's correct.

18:37.160 --> 18:39.549
And you have also brought with you
another bra...

18:40.520 --> 18:44.798
...exactly like the one that she
so flagrantly exhibited herself in?

18:45.440 --> 18:46.873
Yes, that's correct.

18:47.040 --> 18:49.270
What was your golf score
the last round you played...

18:49.440 --> 18:52.000
-...before your shoulder was injured?
-Three under par.

18:53.160 --> 18:55.037
Three under par.

18:56.320 --> 18:58.390
That's what the professionals shoot,
isn't it?

18:58.560 --> 19:00.198
Well, if they're lucky.

19:04.040 --> 19:05.268
Would you tell this jury...

19:05.440 --> 19:08.750
...exactly what you saw at the corner
of 83rd Street and Columbus?

19:12.160 --> 19:14.230
I don't remember.

19:16.640 --> 19:19.279
Did you or did you not see
the defendant wearing the bra?

19:19.600 --> 19:20.999
I don't know. Maybe.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.594
Mr. Seinfeld, I might remind you
that you are under oath.

19:23.760 --> 19:25.193
Now, I ask you again.

19:25.360 --> 19:28.158
Did you or did you not
see this woman wearing a bra?

19:32.000 --> 19:34.389
All right, I saw her. I saw her.

19:35.680 --> 19:39.468
And she was beautiful in that bra.
I'm crazy about her.

19:39.640 --> 19:42.677
I love her whole free-swinging,
freewheeling attitude.

19:42.840 --> 19:44.159
This court will come to order.

19:44.320 --> 19:47.596
-No further questions, Your Honour.
-You may step down.

19:47.760 --> 19:49.751
Well, Kramer,
I think we got this wrapped up.

19:49.920 --> 19:51.478
Yeah, yeah.

19:51.640 --> 19:53.437
What's your read, Stan?

19:53.600 --> 19:56.160
You're close. You're on the green.

19:56.320 --> 19:59.039
You just have to go for the cup.

19:59.200 --> 20:01.589
-What do you mean?
-Have her try on the bra.

20:01.760 --> 20:04.069
-See if it fits.
-No, no, no, no.

20:04.240 --> 20:06.674
Do it, Jackie. Stan's the man.

20:06.840 --> 20:09.513
-Stan? Who the hell is Stan?
-He's my caddy.

20:09.680 --> 20:12.353
Your caddy? This is a big mistake.

20:14.200 --> 20:15.758
Your Honour...

20:15.920 --> 20:20.038
...we request at this time
that Miss Mischke try on the bra.

20:21.960 --> 20:24.155
This court will come to order.

20:24.320 --> 20:26.390
Go ahead, Miss Mischke, try it on.

20:41.560 --> 20:44.836
It doesn't fit. I can't put it on.

20:45.440 --> 20:49.035
You damn fools! Look at that.
We got nothing now. Nothing.

20:49.200 --> 20:52.033
I've been practicing law for 25 years,
you're listening to a caddy.

20:52.200 --> 20:53.679
This is a public humiliation.

20:53.840 --> 20:56.479
You can't let the defendant
control the key piece of evidence.

20:56.640 --> 21:00.076
Plus, she's trying it on over a leotard.
Of course it won't fit over a leotard.

21:00.240 --> 21:04.597
A bra's gotta fit right up against
a person's skin. Like a glove!

21:13.760 --> 21:16.320
Hey, Elaine. How about some lunch?

21:17.360 --> 21:19.191
No, I don't think so.

21:19.360 --> 21:22.557
Great job on the Gatsby Swing Top.
It's a winner.

21:22.720 --> 21:24.278
Yeah. Yeah, thanks.

21:24.440 --> 21:26.510
Sure you don't wanna go?
We have reservations.

21:26.680 --> 21:29.114
Oh, I don't think you'll have
any trouble getting a table.

21:29.920 --> 21:32.150
-Ciao.
-Bye-bye.
