00:29.160 --> 00:31.830
'To the young,
it seems no door is closed

00:31.880 --> 00:34.990
'and as though all hearts are open,

00:35.040 --> 00:36.480
'everything is possible...

00:37.640 --> 00:39.080
'..and love comes so easily.'

00:47.920 --> 00:49.550
Oh, hello. Hello.

00:49.600 --> 00:51.200
Hello.

00:55.720 --> 00:57.110
'I loved my work

00:57.160 --> 00:59.440
'and the freedom
that it brought me.

01:00.480 --> 01:01.870
'I loved the teeming streets,

01:01.920 --> 01:04.550
'the families I encountered.

01:04.599 --> 01:06.350
'I loved it all,

01:06.400 --> 01:09.000
'and I thought the joy
would last for ever.'

01:16.120 --> 01:17.710
What's this?

01:17.760 --> 01:20.910
My attempt at making the Children's
Dental Education Programme

01:20.960 --> 01:22.480
a little more fun.

01:24.440 --> 01:25.950
Would you mind finishing it later?

01:26.000 --> 01:27.750
Nurse Miller's still
with Kitty Chubb

01:27.800 --> 01:29.830
and she's run out of pethidine.

01:29.880 --> 01:31.240
Is there no-one else who can go?

01:32.280 --> 01:35.310
You're next on call,
and it's been a long labour.

01:35.360 --> 01:37.710
I think Nurse Miller
would value some support.

01:37.760 --> 01:38.960
Of course.

01:46.120 --> 01:48.680
I shall see you at the Clinic.

01:50.440 --> 01:51.480
What's that?

01:52.400 --> 01:55.150
The nightdress I was making.

01:55.200 --> 01:58.640
With every stitch, I could see
the baby's face more clearly.

02:00.080 --> 02:03.190
But now the nightdress
will never be needed,

02:03.240 --> 02:04.830
and the face won't go away.

02:04.880 --> 02:09.229
Put it in the drawer, Shelagh.
Put it away out of sight.

02:09.280 --> 02:10.630
I tried that.

02:10.680 --> 02:13.030
This isn't the end of the world.

02:13.080 --> 02:17.160
It's just the end of a road.
We'll find a way ahead.

02:18.320 --> 02:20.880
I'm looking for it. I really am.

02:47.960 --> 02:50.630
I can't keep doing this!

02:50.680 --> 02:52.310
Sshh! You're nearly there, Kitty.

02:52.360 --> 02:54.270
And remember,
every one of these pushes,

02:54.320 --> 02:56.750
you're that bit nearer
to meeting your baby.

02:56.800 --> 02:59.590
Pethidine? Special delivery!

02:59.640 --> 03:02.110
Bless you, Sister,
but we don't need it now!

03:02.160 --> 03:06.470
Baby decided he was in a hurry after
all, and Kitty's coping really well.

03:06.520 --> 03:10.470
No, I'm not! Oh, poor thing...
I need Frankie.

03:10.520 --> 03:12.550
I think I saw Mr Chubb
in the kitchen.

03:12.600 --> 03:15.360
Mr Chubb is called Victor.
Frankie...he's in there.

03:16.600 --> 03:17.920
Top drawer.

03:22.640 --> 03:24.310
That's him!

03:28.600 --> 03:30.520
Big, strong, brave push!

03:32.000 --> 03:33.790
We're nearly there, Kitty.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.670
I'll go and organise some hot water.

03:35.720 --> 03:38.390
Actually, Sister, if could just
pass me that warm towel...

03:50.440 --> 03:51.760
Now pant for me, Kitty.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.150
Good.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.280
Well done.

03:57.360 --> 04:00.200
Now, one more big push.

04:10.720 --> 04:13.600
Oh, what a beautiful baby boy!

04:14.920 --> 04:18.910
Is he mine? Is he really mine?

04:18.959 --> 04:20.630
Oh, yes.

04:20.680 --> 04:23.630
You must think me a right daft 'un,
asking for my teddy.

04:23.680 --> 04:27.000
Not at all. If it helps you,
that's what matters.

04:28.960 --> 04:30.440
Congratulations.

04:51.880 --> 04:55.840
He's yours now, little one.
I'm not a kid any more.

05:07.320 --> 05:10.310
Excuse me? How much longer, please?
What's the name?

05:10.360 --> 05:13.990
Moss. Leah Moss.
I've been here over an hour.

05:14.040 --> 05:17.270
I do apologise, Mrs Moss,
we've been busier than usual today,

05:17.320 --> 05:19.640
but you are after this lady.
Thank you.

05:21.680 --> 05:23.190
Sorry for the long wait.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.670
Could've done without it today,
to be honest.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.710
Don't suppose you've got
a spare hour to lend me?

05:27.760 --> 05:31.230
If only.
You are looking a little tired.

05:31.280 --> 05:32.470
You getting enough rest?

05:32.520 --> 05:33.960
You sound like my mother.

05:36.320 --> 05:39.750
Your ankles are very swollen.
Are they troubling you?

05:39.800 --> 05:42.110
Apart from turning me
into an elephant, no.

05:42.160 --> 05:43.950
Any headaches? Heartburn?

05:44.000 --> 05:46.670
Nothing. I'm sorry,
but I really need to go now.

05:46.720 --> 05:49.960
I just need to check your urine.
It'll only take a minute.

05:51.720 --> 05:53.950
Sister, there isn't
an ashtray in my cubicle.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.800
I'll fetch one right away, doctor.

05:57.120 --> 05:59.510
I do think Kitty will make
a wonderful mother.

05:59.560 --> 06:02.390
She was so distressed
when she was in labour!

06:02.440 --> 06:06.960
Oh, it's deliveries like Kitty's
that make me glad I'm a midwife.

06:07.960 --> 06:10.030
It's as though
I've found my true purpose.

06:10.080 --> 06:13.350
I felt like that when I was
called to the religious life.

06:13.400 --> 06:17.350
Sister, do you enjoy
the medical side of things?

06:17.400 --> 06:20.470
Of course! I started off as
a teacher in the village school,

06:20.520 --> 06:23.030
but that's what you do
when you join this Order,

06:23.080 --> 06:25.110
you train as a nurse,
and then as a midwife,

06:25.160 --> 06:27.630
and all the while
you're studying to take your vows.

06:27.680 --> 06:32.080
It's quite a tall order.
Yes. I've learned a lot.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.360
Oh, I just don't seem to feel
the same...

06:38.680 --> 06:40.680
..joy that others do.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.630
Perhaps stop trying quite so hard

06:44.680 --> 06:47.390
and instead just...feel,

06:47.440 --> 06:51.280
feel the mother's pain,
the mother's joy.

06:52.480 --> 06:53.920
The happiness is catching.

07:02.280 --> 07:03.400
Mrs Moss?

07:38.520 --> 07:39.950
Mama, I'm sorry to be so long,

07:40.000 --> 07:42.880
I was waiting and waiting
for the Kranknshvester.

07:44.680 --> 07:45.840
Mama?

07:48.200 --> 07:49.280
Mama?

07:51.600 --> 07:53.080
Not again?

07:57.080 --> 07:59.320
No, not yet.

08:00.440 --> 08:02.360
We'll wait till it passes.

08:08.480 --> 08:13.150
A free spirit, a suffragette,
a nobler heroine!

08:13.200 --> 08:14.350
That's all well and good,

08:14.400 --> 08:17.070
but it doesn't mean Miss Scarlett
is innocent of murder!

08:17.120 --> 08:19.670
Murder in Nonnatus House?

08:19.720 --> 08:23.480
An enthralling board game, in which
we are required to play detective.

08:24.680 --> 08:25.910
Cluedo.

08:25.960 --> 08:27.120
Sshh!

08:29.000 --> 08:30.560
J'accuse...

08:32.559 --> 08:35.190
..Colonel Mustard,

08:35.240 --> 08:36.710
for one should never trust

08:36.760 --> 08:39.159
a yellow-bellied,
colonial imperialist...

08:40.200 --> 08:42.990
..in the Billiard Room -

08:43.039 --> 08:47.200
billiards is such
a foolish pastime - with...

08:48.360 --> 08:51.790
..a revolver -
the weapon of cowards.

08:51.840 --> 08:56.110
It's about collecting clues,
not divine inspiration!

08:56.160 --> 08:57.950
Well? Am I correct?

08:58.000 --> 08:59.040
Oh-h!

09:01.840 --> 09:02.880
Yes!

09:04.360 --> 09:06.230
Do you wish to join us, Sister?

09:06.280 --> 09:09.830
I must confess, I find this game
singularly invigorating!

09:09.880 --> 09:12.030
It would be more so,
if you followed the rules!

09:12.080 --> 09:16.350
Perhaps another time. I have some
correspondence to take care of.

09:16.400 --> 09:19.710
I only agreed to join you in this
nonsense on condition you help me

09:19.760 --> 09:23.280
with the rest of the donations, so
I suggest we go and do that instead.

09:24.640 --> 09:25.710
I see.

09:25.760 --> 09:27.430
What?

09:27.480 --> 09:30.070
You do not take defeat very well,

09:30.120 --> 09:34.070
so it's best we abandon
all hope of a rematch.

09:34.120 --> 09:38.150
I am indubitably the superior player

09:38.200 --> 09:42.750
and I would not wish
to vanquish you a second time.

09:42.800 --> 09:47.280
Well, if you'll pardon me,
I'll leave the experts to it.

09:52.760 --> 09:56.070
♪ Oh, I do like to stroll along
the prom-prom-prom

09:56.120 --> 09:59.910
♪ Where the brass band plays
tiddly-om-pom-pom..."

09:59.960 --> 10:03.070
If you're hoping for a duet,
I'm afraid I'm far too tired.

10:03.120 --> 10:06.590
I don't want a duet,
I want an answer to a question.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.950
And I'm rather hoping
that answer might be yes.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.630
Well, it depends on the question.

10:10.680 --> 10:13.670
I don't suppose you'd like to come
with me to Brighton this weekend -

10:13.720 --> 10:15.870
all perfectly respectable.

10:15.920 --> 10:17.590
A chap at work had
a hotel reservation

10:17.640 --> 10:19.150
and he can't go now so...

10:19.200 --> 10:23.230
Jenny, have you seen my dratted
tennis racket anywhere?

10:23.280 --> 10:25.950
If Sister Evangelina's borrowed it
to chase mice again...

10:26.000 --> 10:27.680
I'll be up in a minute.

10:31.400 --> 10:33.830
Do say yes.
It would be nice, for once,

10:33.880 --> 10:36.110
not to have to compete
with every nurse and mother

10:36.160 --> 10:37.920
in the East End for your attention.

10:39.400 --> 10:42.320
It is my weekend off.
Is that a yes, then?

10:44.160 --> 10:47.840
Well, I do like to
be beside the seaside.

11:00.400 --> 11:01.910
Cynthia!

11:01.960 --> 11:03.750
Say you'll come shopping
with me tomorrow.

11:03.800 --> 11:06.270
There's a dress I've been
dying for an excuse to buy,

11:06.320 --> 11:08.840
and Alec's invited me
somewhere quite exciting! Has he?

11:10.520 --> 11:12.630
Penny for them? Sorry.

11:12.680 --> 11:15.710
It's just that I've had such an odd
conversation with Sister Winifred.

11:15.760 --> 11:18.590
What about? I noticed something
wasn't right

11:18.640 --> 11:20.870
when Kitty Chubb gave birth
this morning.

11:20.920 --> 11:23.840
She just looked terribly uneasy.

11:25.360 --> 11:26.950
And when we were talking it over,

11:27.000 --> 11:30.400
she seemed to be saying that she
found midwifery quite hard.

11:31.600 --> 11:33.950
Perhaps we need to give her
more support. Yes.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.550
We were all beginners once.

11:35.600 --> 11:38.560
Gosh, who would've thought
we'd end up the old hands?

11:39.600 --> 11:42.800
Now, tell me all about this dress.

11:58.760 --> 12:00.200
Where's my sweetheart?

12:03.360 --> 12:06.270
Got you some little treats
from the shop,

12:06.320 --> 12:08.430
schmaltz herring,
er, pickled cucumbers -

12:08.480 --> 12:12.520
I know you've been craving them,
little bit of cream cheese... Why?

12:18.560 --> 12:21.350
Benny Koffman
stopped by the delicatessen,

12:21.400 --> 12:23.270
turns out his manager's
moving to Israel

12:23.320 --> 12:25.190
and he's looking for a new one,

12:25.240 --> 12:26.590
wants to know if I fancy it.

12:26.640 --> 12:28.790
Benny Koffman's
shop's in Golders Green?

12:28.840 --> 12:31.760
There's a flat above it,
and a garden for the little 'un.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.840
This is our chance to get out
the East End.

12:41.200 --> 12:43.270
It's, er, it's going to be a no,
isn't it?

12:43.320 --> 12:45.830
What about my mother?
Take her to a doctor, Leah.

12:45.880 --> 12:48.590
No doctors, Charlie.
I won't even discuss it.

12:48.640 --> 12:51.110
It's 12 years
since she left this flat!

12:51.160 --> 12:53.870
Do you think that doesn't make me
feel as trapped as she is?

12:53.920 --> 12:56.950
Do you think
I want to be stuck here,

12:57.000 --> 12:59.960
imprisoned in this house of ghosts?

13:02.200 --> 13:04.150
Talk to her, Leah.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.600
Talk to her.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.110
My dear!

13:11.160 --> 13:13.710
Sister Monica Joan let me in.

13:13.760 --> 13:16.880
I wanted to give you something,
for the charity box.

13:25.920 --> 13:26.960
Hello?

13:32.280 --> 13:33.400
Midwives calling.

13:35.600 --> 13:40.200
Come in, come in.
Don't stand on the doorstep!

13:42.440 --> 13:47.910
I'm so ashamed, we've not so much as
a crumb in the house to offer you.

13:47.960 --> 13:51.590
We're not here to eat, Mrs Rubin.
We've come to see your daughter.

13:51.640 --> 13:53.320
She's in the bedroom.

13:58.840 --> 14:02.000
Hello. I'm Nurse Miller...
What on earth are you doing?

14:03.240 --> 14:04.280
Let me help you.

14:08.640 --> 14:12.030
Sister Winifred was
bringing your delivery pack,

14:12.080 --> 14:14.310
so thought I'd tag along.

14:14.360 --> 14:17.350
Nurse Lee told me you left
the clinic in rather a hurry.

14:17.400 --> 14:19.310
I'm sorry. Don't worry.

14:19.360 --> 14:20.990
Your urine test was clear,

14:21.040 --> 14:24.870
but we do need you to help us
keep on top of routine checks.

14:24.920 --> 14:27.070
It's important for you
and for your baby.

14:27.120 --> 14:28.830
I had to come home.

14:28.880 --> 14:31.710
My mother doesn't like
being left alone for too long.

14:31.760 --> 14:32.990
We can come to you here.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.230
Apart from anything else,
it will give us

14:35.280 --> 14:38.320
a chance to make sure
you're not doing any heavy lifting.

14:40.040 --> 14:42.040
Just going to take
your blood pressure.

14:44.560 --> 14:48.360
When Dr Turner and I married,
I was so sure what my life would be.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.880
Just as sure as I was
when I took my vows.

14:53.120 --> 14:56.560
But now...
I don't feel sure of anything.

14:57.680 --> 14:59.470
I can't picture the future at all.

14:59.520 --> 15:02.920
In the past year, your life has
changed unrecognisably.

15:04.360 --> 15:07.510
It's understandable that you
looked for certainties.

15:07.560 --> 15:08.840
Perhaps I was greedy!

15:10.000 --> 15:12.710
I was given so much,
and I wanted more.

15:12.760 --> 15:16.470
Do not even begin to think of your
childlessness as a punishment.

15:16.520 --> 15:17.870
I will not allow it.

15:17.920 --> 15:18.960
Thank you.

15:22.200 --> 15:24.910
I need something to occupy my mind.

15:24.960 --> 15:27.430
I'm not used to having so much time.

15:27.480 --> 15:29.870
You have so many gifts, Shelagh.

15:29.920 --> 15:31.550
Oh, I don't know about that.

15:31.600 --> 15:34.750
You have energy and compassion
and intelligence

15:34.800 --> 15:37.270
and a voice I have seldom
heard matched.

15:37.320 --> 15:39.870
I only sing in church now.

15:39.920 --> 15:42.000
Have you thought of joining a choir?

15:43.080 --> 15:46.030
Poplar Choral Society
have a wonderful repertoire.

15:46.080 --> 15:48.190
I thought I heard their director
had retired?

15:48.240 --> 15:51.920
Yes, but the choir itself
is still going strong.

15:53.560 --> 15:55.760
I don't doubt they'd welcome you
with open arms.

15:58.120 --> 16:00.440
So, you are a nun?

16:01.560 --> 16:02.710
Yes.

16:02.760 --> 16:04.270
And a midwife?

16:04.320 --> 16:06.430
That's right.

16:06.480 --> 16:09.790
It is truly a wonderful thing,
what you do,

16:09.840 --> 16:14.950
bringing life into the world,
seeing everything made new.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.950
Everything's coming along nicely,

16:18.000 --> 16:21.830
but I've ticked Leah off -
she's been trying to do too much.

16:21.880 --> 16:24.830
That's my fault.
I make work for her.

16:24.880 --> 16:26.310
I'm sure that's not true.

16:26.360 --> 16:27.640
She has attacks.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.430
Attacks?

16:30.480 --> 16:31.870
Dizzy spells.

16:31.920 --> 16:34.430
It's gornisht - nothing.

16:34.480 --> 16:35.590
It's not nothing!

16:35.640 --> 16:38.350
What if you have a dizzy spell
when you're out and about?

16:38.400 --> 16:40.510
You may fall and hurt yourself.

16:40.560 --> 16:43.350
I don't go outside,
so that will not happen.

16:43.400 --> 16:44.640
You don't go outside?

16:46.080 --> 16:48.550
Sometimes I do
and sometimes I don't.

16:48.600 --> 16:52.710
The attacks, they come and they go.

16:52.760 --> 16:55.630
We can arrange for a doctor
to drop by and see you.

16:55.680 --> 16:59.790
There's no need for a doctor.
She just needs peace and quiet.

16:59.840 --> 17:02.960
And peace and quiet, I get at home.

17:06.800 --> 17:11.190
Apparently the restaurant serves the
best moules marinieres in England,

17:11.240 --> 17:13.670
and I've just remembered
you don't like shellfish.

17:13.720 --> 17:17.150
Well, if it's a seafood restaurant,
there'll be Dover sole.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.470
I'll have to throw you out
in a minute.

17:19.520 --> 17:21.950
I'll be up all hours packing.
I haven't even started.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.150
Sshh! Not so loud.

17:25.200 --> 17:28.990
There's something extremely urgent
we must attend to first.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.360
What if one of the nuns walks past?

17:33.000 --> 17:38.560
♪ I was made for you

17:41.280 --> 17:43.270
♪ Nature...

17:43.320 --> 17:46.230
I never used to think I could dance.

17:46.280 --> 17:49.200
When I dance with you,
it feels as if we're in a film.

17:50.840 --> 17:52.160
Like Debbie Reynolds.

17:53.800 --> 17:55.440
Does that make me Gene Kelly?

17:56.880 --> 17:58.360
I rather think it does.

18:11.640 --> 18:14.590
I say! What do you think?

18:14.640 --> 18:18.070
I think how wicked you are
to be spending two whole nights

18:18.120 --> 18:19.390
in a hotel with a man.

18:19.440 --> 18:21.350
Surely you don't think...

18:21.400 --> 18:24.030
Alec will have organised two rooms!

18:24.080 --> 18:25.750
Oh, I'm teasing, silly.

18:25.800 --> 18:28.270
I'm sure it will all
be perfectly proper.

18:28.320 --> 18:31.310
Though I think that's
what he's organised.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.670
He didn't exactly say.

18:32.720 --> 18:36.550
Oh, it's going to be lovely,
strolling, hand in hand,

18:36.600 --> 18:37.960
along the pier.

18:39.040 --> 18:41.070
But you are a modern girl
in many ways,

18:41.120 --> 18:43.350
he might have made assumptions.

18:43.400 --> 18:44.710
Men will be men.

18:44.760 --> 18:47.350
Not Alec, surely!

18:47.400 --> 18:48.550
Course not.

18:48.600 --> 18:51.110
In which case, you'd better have
such a marvellous time

18:51.160 --> 18:53.440
that you make us all positively
green with envy.

18:55.480 --> 18:57.310
Hello.

18:57.360 --> 18:58.630
Ah, hello!

18:58.680 --> 19:01.750
Do take a seat,
Mr Jesmond will be with you shortly.

19:01.800 --> 19:04.790
You can take in the luxurious
ambience while you wait.

19:04.840 --> 19:06.310
D'you know when he'll be back?

19:06.360 --> 19:08.150
Well, he said
he was going to the bank

19:08.200 --> 19:11.510
to withdraw the wherewithal
for your little treat...in Brighton.

19:11.560 --> 19:12.550
I see.

19:12.600 --> 19:14.190
It's a shame
I had to cancel my plans,

19:14.240 --> 19:17.670
I've had some memorable weekends
in that hotel.

19:17.720 --> 19:20.630
Still, you two are clearly
going to make the most of it.

19:20.680 --> 19:21.710
What's he been saying?

19:21.760 --> 19:25.390
Oh, not much. But then,
he doesn't need to say much.

19:25.440 --> 19:27.670
We understand each other.

19:27.720 --> 19:30.030
Jenny! What a lovely surprise!

19:30.080 --> 19:32.790
Didn't think I'd be seeing you
until this evening.

19:32.840 --> 19:33.910
What have you told him?

19:33.960 --> 19:36.390
Just that I was looking forward
to taking you away.

19:36.440 --> 19:38.950
I was under the impression
you'd booked two separate rooms!

19:39.000 --> 19:41.310
He clearly isn't!
Jenny, you're making assumptions.

19:41.360 --> 19:42.950
No, Alec, you are.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.520
Enjoy your moules marinieres!

19:50.440 --> 19:52.390
That's perfect!

19:52.440 --> 19:55.510
You just need to take it easy now
these last few days.

19:55.560 --> 19:59.990
Don't worry, Sister,
I do all the housework today.

20:00.040 --> 20:05.590
Not only is it our Shabbas soon,
it is also the festival of Shavous.

20:05.640 --> 20:07.110
I've heard of Shavous.

20:07.160 --> 20:09.870
Isn't it the Feast of Weeks,
the day you read the Book of Ruth?

20:09.920 --> 20:13.590
And the day I make cheesecake!

20:13.640 --> 20:16.270
A recipe from the heim.

20:16.320 --> 20:18.030
You want to try a bit?

20:18.080 --> 20:21.710
Oh, I've got to get back in time
for evening prayer.

20:21.760 --> 20:24.030
I do love the story of Ruth.

20:24.080 --> 20:26.110
"Whither thou goest I will go

20:26.160 --> 20:28.350
"and where thou lodgest,
I will lodge."

20:28.400 --> 20:29.670
Leah...

20:29.720 --> 20:30.960
Oh, my goodness.

20:32.400 --> 20:33.880
Sit in the chair, Leah.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.910
Sorry.

20:37.960 --> 20:39.630
Don't lift her or she'll vomit!

20:39.680 --> 20:41.230
I'm sending for the doctor, Leah.

20:41.280 --> 20:42.510
I'm sending for the doctor,

20:42.560 --> 20:45.160
if not for your mother's sake,
then for your baby's.

20:47.560 --> 20:50.990
I don't want to go to choir
practice! It will all be old women.

20:51.040 --> 20:55.550
No, it won't. It's a choral society,
all sorts of people join.

20:55.600 --> 20:58.870
I like piano and violin,
I don't like singing.

20:58.920 --> 21:00.270
Good evening, PC Noakes.

21:00.320 --> 21:03.070
Evening, Mrs Turner.
How are you, Timothy?

21:03.120 --> 21:04.710
Rather hoping I might get arrested,

21:04.760 --> 21:06.910
so I don't have to go
to choir practice.

21:06.960 --> 21:09.550
We're joining
the Poplar Choral Society tonight.

21:09.600 --> 21:13.430
Timothy's vexed because
he's missing The Lone Ranger.

21:13.480 --> 21:17.310
Me too. Mind you, I've always
fancied singing in a choir.

21:17.360 --> 21:18.550
You could go instead of me.

21:18.600 --> 21:21.150
Well, I'd be quite tempted,
but, er, I'm on duty.

21:21.200 --> 21:22.590
You enjoy yourselves.

21:22.640 --> 21:24.480
We'll be sure to do just that.

21:30.720 --> 21:32.670
I think we've come
on the wrong night.

21:32.720 --> 21:35.230
Mrs Turner and Timothy?

21:35.280 --> 21:36.750
Mr Delaney?

21:36.800 --> 21:38.830
Welcome, welcome. Both of you.

21:38.880 --> 21:41.430
This all looks very...cosy.

21:41.480 --> 21:45.270
Since you telephoned, we've lost
three more members and our pianist.

21:45.320 --> 21:47.190
So this is it, I'm sorry to say.

21:47.240 --> 21:50.350
Five voices isn't so bad.

21:50.400 --> 21:52.750
And Timothy plays the piano,
don't you?

21:52.800 --> 21:53.990
Yes, but I can't sing.

21:54.040 --> 21:55.950
Oh, as a matter of fact,
we were about to head to

21:56.000 --> 21:57.590
the Coach and Horses.

21:57.640 --> 21:59.110
You can come, if you like?

21:59.160 --> 22:01.790
The nipper can sit on the steps
and we'll send out a cream soda.

22:01.840 --> 22:02.990
All right!

22:03.040 --> 22:05.710
You're very kind. But no, thank you.

22:05.760 --> 22:08.960
Come on, ladies!
All good things come to an end.

22:16.640 --> 22:19.320
Coach and Horses is
only round the corner. No!

22:30.200 --> 22:32.750
Baby seems completely unperturbed.

22:32.800 --> 22:34.910
What about my mother?

22:34.960 --> 22:37.470
The sedative I've given her
will help.

22:37.520 --> 22:40.880
Not least because it means
I can ask you some questions.

22:42.360 --> 22:45.030
Aside from dizziness,
nausea and hearing loss,

22:45.080 --> 22:47.590
does your mother
have any other symptoms?

22:47.640 --> 22:50.070
She hasn't set foot outside
this flat for 12 years.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.430
12 years?

22:51.480 --> 22:53.150
Please don't take her away.

22:53.200 --> 22:56.230
I know she's lost her mind,
but I can look after her.

22:56.280 --> 22:58.640
What makes you think
she's lost her mind?

23:00.320 --> 23:02.390
During the war,

23:02.440 --> 23:05.240
Mama and I were in a Nazi ghetto.

23:06.440 --> 23:09.230
A miracle happened and we escaped.

23:09.280 --> 23:11.920
We lived in a cellar
till it was safe.

23:13.120 --> 23:17.160
When we returned home, our family,
our friends were...

23:18.320 --> 23:20.670
..gone.

23:20.720 --> 23:24.270
Soon after, we move to London
and these attacks start.

23:24.320 --> 23:26.270
You see now?

23:26.320 --> 23:30.480
Mrs Moss, I am not going
to take your mother anywhere.

23:31.800 --> 23:35.320
You've lost enough,
she's lost enough.

23:36.480 --> 23:39.150
But we do need to get to
the bottom of what ails her.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.550
I told you.
It's her mind that ails her.

23:41.600 --> 23:43.510
Not necessarily.

23:43.560 --> 23:47.270
It's possible we may be looking at
a form of vertigo,

23:47.320 --> 23:49.350
something called Meniere's disease.

23:49.400 --> 23:51.110
It's a problem with the inner ear.

23:51.160 --> 23:52.790
The ear? Yes.

23:52.840 --> 23:55.550
And there are medications
we can try.

23:55.600 --> 23:56.950
Really?

23:57.000 --> 24:01.070
A fear of leaving home is quite
common with Meniere's sufferers.

24:01.120 --> 24:03.030
It may be that everything's related.

24:03.080 --> 24:07.230
So, if you treat her ear,
she'll be able to go outside?

24:07.280 --> 24:10.150
There is every reason for optimism.

24:10.200 --> 24:13.510
After 12 years.
I can hardly believe it.

24:13.560 --> 24:15.670
Thank you both.

24:15.720 --> 24:17.670
Thank you.

24:17.720 --> 24:20.790
You've no business talking to
her about our weekend plans, Clive.

24:20.840 --> 24:23.870
Look, sorry old thing, but
she lured me into a conversation.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.430
She was checking up on you.

24:25.480 --> 24:27.630
I don't care if she was.
I've got nothing to hide.

24:27.680 --> 24:30.150
Look, why don't you come out
on the town with me instead?

24:30.200 --> 24:31.710
I'll find you a nice new girl.

24:31.760 --> 24:34.270
That Nurse Jenny Lee
is far too proper.

24:34.320 --> 24:37.310
And do you know something? That's
exactly what I like about her!

24:37.360 --> 24:39.070
It was a joke!

24:40.720 --> 24:42.430
Aaargh!

24:42.480 --> 24:43.600
Alec!

24:50.480 --> 24:52.150
Police! Police! Police!

24:52.200 --> 24:54.990
There's been
an accident, quick!

24:55.040 --> 24:56.720
He's over here.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.230
The staircase just gave way.

25:00.280 --> 25:01.430
Oh, no...

25:01.480 --> 25:03.390
Is he...

25:03.440 --> 25:05.110
Is he dead?

25:05.160 --> 25:06.710
No.

25:06.760 --> 25:09.400
Alec? Alec!

25:10.560 --> 25:13.990
I'll stay with him,
you call an ambulance.

25:14.040 --> 25:15.510
But fetch the doctor first!

25:15.560 --> 25:17.750
I just saw his car parked
halfway up James Street.

25:17.800 --> 25:20.600
It's a green Austin.
Knock on doors if you have to!

25:21.600 --> 25:24.240
Alec? Alec?

25:30.000 --> 25:32.190
Here. It's Alec Jesmond.

25:32.240 --> 25:34.470
No...

25:34.520 --> 25:37.150
He's breathing, but spark out.

25:37.200 --> 25:38.960
Has been since I arrived.

25:47.600 --> 25:49.520
Main problem looks like his leg.

25:53.840 --> 25:55.440
He fell from up there.

26:05.880 --> 26:07.070
Nasty.

26:07.120 --> 26:11.190
The femur's shattered. And I
don't like the look of this foot.

26:11.240 --> 26:13.520
We're going to have
to get his shoe off.

26:15.800 --> 26:18.270
It's all right, mate. It's all right.
Aaargh!

26:18.320 --> 26:21.070
You've come a bit of a cropper.
The doctor's here.

26:21.120 --> 26:22.430
Aargh!

26:22.480 --> 26:25.790
Sorry, sorry. Just try
and stay as still as you can.

26:25.840 --> 26:28.760
Everything's all right, mate.
The ambulance is on its way.

26:35.200 --> 26:37.870
No blood supply.

26:37.920 --> 26:39.950
The whole limb is at risk.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.120
Now, do as I tell you
and we might save his leg.

27:01.280 --> 27:02.790
Any more pads?

27:02.840 --> 27:04.710
There's a couple of rolled bandages.

27:04.760 --> 27:06.000
Thank you.

27:12.120 --> 27:15.320
I need your tie too,
to fix the splint. And yours.

27:19.600 --> 27:21.950
You go outside and wait
to flag down the ambulance.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.040
Yes, sir.

27:25.360 --> 27:27.000
Aaargh!

27:29.280 --> 27:31.390
My leg... Alec, don't move.

27:31.440 --> 27:34.030
In a moment, I can give you
something to help with the pain,

27:34.080 --> 27:37.030
but I just need you
to stay completely still.

27:37.080 --> 27:38.830
Where's his ambulance?

27:38.880 --> 27:40.550
That's the man.

27:40.600 --> 27:42.270
It's going to be OK, mate.

27:42.320 --> 27:44.310
Is it?

27:44.360 --> 27:45.750
Yeah, it better be.

27:45.800 --> 27:48.990
I don't fancy giving any bad news
to that girlfriend of yours.

27:49.040 --> 27:50.790
No, you don't. No.

27:54.640 --> 27:57.950
A problem with my ear?

27:58.000 --> 27:59.830
And it can be mended?

27:59.880 --> 28:03.790
The doctor believes so.
It means you can leave the house.

28:03.840 --> 28:06.230
It means you don't need
to be scared any more.

28:06.280 --> 28:08.270
And the timing couldn't be better.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.310
What do you mean?

28:10.360 --> 28:13.350
You know we always talk of
moving to North West London?

28:13.400 --> 28:15.950
Well, Benny Koffman
has asked Charlie to be

28:16.000 --> 28:17.310
the manager of his shop.

28:17.360 --> 28:18.950
In Golders Green!

28:19.000 --> 28:21.760
And there's a flat too,
with room for all of us.

28:23.040 --> 28:24.480
I see.

28:26.520 --> 28:30.670
So much news you give me,
all in one evening.

28:30.720 --> 28:33.200
We need to let Benny know
by Sunday, Mama.

28:34.600 --> 28:36.360
And today is Shabbas.

28:39.280 --> 28:42.600
On Sunday, we start packing.

29:05.480 --> 29:07.200
Steady on the way, gentlemen.

29:09.200 --> 29:11.230
How can I have been so naive?

29:11.280 --> 29:13.590
Are you quite certain
that Alec's intentions

29:13.640 --> 29:15.510
aren't of the honourable kind?

29:15.560 --> 29:17.590
You said yourself, men will be men.

29:17.640 --> 29:19.270
You said Alec wasn't like that.

29:19.320 --> 29:21.800
And nothing you've told me
now suggests otherwise.

29:23.280 --> 29:26.190
I wish you could have heard
this chap. He was nauseating.

29:26.240 --> 29:28.670
But Alec isn't, though.

29:28.720 --> 29:31.830
Perhaps you should discuss it
with him now you've calmed down.

29:31.880 --> 29:33.390
There's still time to go.

29:34.760 --> 29:36.070
Cynthia?

29:36.120 --> 29:38.030
We've had a call.

29:38.080 --> 29:39.800
There's been an accident.

29:46.560 --> 29:47.870
How is he?

29:47.920 --> 29:49.390
He's out of theatre.

29:49.440 --> 29:51.470
He's broken his right femur,

29:51.520 --> 29:54.000
left arm and several ribs.

29:55.400 --> 29:56.680
What about his foot?

29:57.920 --> 29:59.320
They couldn't save it.

30:00.640 --> 30:04.510
His ankle was so shattered, he would
never have walked on it again.

30:04.560 --> 30:06.430
They said he would have
lost the whole leg

30:06.480 --> 30:08.280
if it hadn't been for Doctor Turner.

30:15.320 --> 30:17.270
What makes
you think that?

30:17.320 --> 30:20.190
I don't know. If it's a boy...

30:30.080 --> 30:31.710
Visiting hours are over.

30:31.760 --> 30:33.280
Mr Jesmond needs to rest.

30:59.280 --> 31:01.070
Oh, Nurse Lee.

31:01.120 --> 31:02.630
How are you?

31:02.680 --> 31:06.470
Only, I heard what happened
to your gentleman friend...

31:08.320 --> 31:10.200
You poor kid, come here.

31:12.320 --> 31:14.590
Have you slept or
had anything to eat?

31:14.640 --> 31:16.190
I haven't been able to do either.

31:16.240 --> 31:18.230
Well, I can't do anything
about the sleeping,

31:18.280 --> 31:20.830
save knocking you over
the head with a mallet.

31:20.880 --> 31:23.230
But I can give you something
to keep your strength up.

31:23.280 --> 31:24.670
So, go on.

31:24.720 --> 31:27.150
Oh, no, Fred, I couldn't.
You made that for yourself.

31:27.200 --> 31:30.110
No, it's all right.
I shouldn't really, anyway.

31:30.160 --> 31:32.880
I mean, me guts been
giving me jip... Thank you.

31:38.440 --> 31:40.750
Mmm. Mmm.

31:40.800 --> 31:44.270
Maybe I should wait until
after I get the tests?

31:44.320 --> 31:46.950
You'll have to leave
the flat to get the tests.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.950
What if I have an attack?

31:49.000 --> 31:50.350
You do want to go out?

31:50.400 --> 31:53.310
Would I be doing this,
would I be struggling like this,

31:53.360 --> 31:54.630
if I didn't want to?!

31:54.680 --> 31:57.680
Try, Mama. Please try.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.550
Don't worry.

32:16.600 --> 32:19.030
We'll try again.

32:19.080 --> 32:23.960
Yes, thank you,
you've been very helpful. Goodbye.

32:28.400 --> 32:32.790
The vascular surgeon
saved Alec Jesmond's leg,

32:32.840 --> 32:34.120
but not his foot.

32:35.480 --> 32:39.590
What age is he? 25, 26?

32:39.640 --> 32:42.310
He'll live another 50 years,
Patrick.

32:42.360 --> 32:44.080
You played your part in that.

32:45.520 --> 32:46.670
Do you want one?

32:46.720 --> 32:48.110
I always want one.

32:48.160 --> 32:50.120
But you don't always ask.

33:00.960 --> 33:03.430
Patrick, I'm going
to take on that choir.

33:03.480 --> 33:05.470
Revive it, get it back on its feet.

33:05.520 --> 33:06.950
Well, that's a bold move.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.150
I'm a bold girl.

33:09.200 --> 33:10.720
Sometimes.

33:15.320 --> 33:18.150
We tried three times and she
can't even stand on the doorstep,

33:18.200 --> 33:19.790
let alone on the street.

33:19.840 --> 33:21.110
Why not?

33:21.160 --> 33:23.110
Perhaps she needs more time.

33:23.160 --> 33:26.150
How much more? Another 12 years?

33:26.200 --> 33:28.670
The mind is
a very complicated thing.

33:28.720 --> 33:31.550
I've already told Benny
I'm taking the job!

33:31.600 --> 33:34.000
Well, now you can tell him
that you're not!

33:35.560 --> 33:38.350
So...

33:38.400 --> 33:39.760
no foot.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
Better no foot than no you.

33:53.760 --> 33:55.560
What am I going to do?

33:59.760 --> 34:02.760
We are going to do perfectly well.

34:08.679 --> 34:10.989
Who here brushes their teeth?
- Me!

34:11.040 --> 34:13.270
Are you going to show me?

34:13.320 --> 34:15.350
Ah, now brushing across is fun,

34:15.400 --> 34:17.030
I'll grant you,
but it won't do the job.

34:17.080 --> 34:19.389
You see, if you wanted to clean
between your fingers,

34:19.440 --> 34:22.670
you wouldn't brush across them
like this, would you?

34:22.719 --> 34:25.110
Up and down! You'd go up and down!

34:25.159 --> 34:27.190
That's it, you already know...

34:28.719 --> 34:31.310
Would you like to come through?

34:31.360 --> 34:34.230
♪ With little forget-me-nots
placed here and there

34:34.280 --> 34:40.230
♪ When I had it on
I walked on the air. ♪

34:42.520 --> 34:43.949
That was lovely.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.630
We've been singing since school.

34:45.679 --> 34:48.389
We fancied ourselves
as the new Chordettes.

34:48.440 --> 34:49.949
Only look at us now.

34:50.000 --> 34:53.469
All mums, just a few weeks
between our babies.

34:53.520 --> 34:55.310
You've got beautiful voices.

34:55.360 --> 34:56.989
Miss all that singing.

34:57.040 --> 35:00.310
Ladies, I might have
just the thing for you.

35:00.360 --> 35:02.510
How would you like to join my choir?

35:02.560 --> 35:04.910
We'll be practising
one evening a week.

35:04.960 --> 35:07.560
Love to, Mrs Turner.
But we've got little ones.

35:08.880 --> 35:11.470
I'm sure you'll be able to bring
them along to rehearsals.

35:11.520 --> 35:13.550
Kitty? You shouldn't be here,

35:13.600 --> 35:15.990
you know you're still
entitled to home visits.

35:16.040 --> 35:17.630
I got bored of home visits.

35:17.680 --> 35:19.310
Anyway, I wanted to show him off.

35:19.360 --> 35:22.430
Aww, he's still got his teddy.

35:22.480 --> 35:25.350
Oh, we don't go nowhere
without Frankie!

35:25.400 --> 35:28.190
Don't forget to tell your family
and friends about the choir.

35:28.240 --> 35:29.270
A choir?

35:29.320 --> 35:32.790
I'm taking over
the Poplar Choral Society.

35:32.840 --> 35:36.710
Numbers had dwindled and it would
be such a shame if it died out.

35:36.760 --> 35:39.230
Goodness. Have you ever
run a choir before?

35:39.280 --> 35:40.670
I haven't.

35:40.720 --> 35:43.110
But no-one else has
taken up the reins.

35:43.160 --> 35:45.880
Sometimes we have to take
matters into our own hands.

35:52.520 --> 35:54.000
Mrs Rubin...

35:55.880 --> 35:57.470
Mrs Rubin, when I was 12,

35:57.520 --> 35:59.750
there was a horse that lived
on the farm next door.

35:59.800 --> 36:03.790
He'd been a fine racer, but then
was kept in the stables so long

36:03.840 --> 36:06.030
he wouldn't come outdoors any more.

36:06.080 --> 36:09.510
So the farmer tried
a tiny bit at a time...

36:09.560 --> 36:13.470
You think I'm an alte kliatshe
and don't know what you're doing?!

36:13.520 --> 36:17.110
Coming into my house
and calling me a horse!

36:17.160 --> 36:21.310
Yes, all right, it was a silly idea.

36:21.360 --> 36:25.110
But I cannot sit back

36:25.160 --> 36:28.110
and watch your family
fall to pieces after

36:28.160 --> 36:30.080
everything you've been through.

36:33.320 --> 36:35.160
What about this story?

36:36.760 --> 36:38.550
It's about a heroine

36:38.600 --> 36:41.790
called Tzirale Rubin,

36:41.840 --> 36:45.350
who fought and beat
the most evil humans in history.

36:45.400 --> 36:47.430
Who saved her daughter's life.

36:47.480 --> 36:50.670
And left her family and
friends behind?

36:50.720 --> 36:52.150
Some heroine!

36:52.200 --> 36:53.520
Listen to me!

36:54.840 --> 36:58.710
You are a warrior, Mrs Rubin.

36:58.760 --> 37:01.440
You can fight this!

37:03.960 --> 37:05.520
Take my arm.

37:06.960 --> 37:08.480
Take it.

37:13.600 --> 37:15.440
That's right.

37:25.080 --> 37:26.230
No.

37:26.280 --> 37:27.720
No, please!

37:31.800 --> 37:35.230
Everyone tells you that
the love in films isn't real.

37:35.280 --> 37:39.950
But I know what you and I have
is better than in any film.

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
When I thought I might lose you...

37:44.400 --> 37:47.030
When you get out of here,
we're going straight to Brighton.

37:47.080 --> 37:48.990
Then Paris.

37:49.040 --> 37:51.720
Where Gene Kelly
and Debbie Reynolds belong.

37:54.960 --> 37:58.710
Won't be able to do
much dancing, of course.

37:58.760 --> 38:00.520
We'll be dancing in here.

38:02.240 --> 38:03.680
Even now?

38:04.800 --> 38:06.710
Yes.

38:06.760 --> 38:08.390
How do I look?

38:08.440 --> 38:11.110
Pretty suave?

38:11.160 --> 38:12.680
The suavest.

38:18.040 --> 38:19.840
My beautiful Jenny.

38:27.600 --> 38:31.750
So, do you think I'll be able
to get 50% off shoes from now on?

38:31.800 --> 38:33.000
Absolutely.

38:35.560 --> 38:37.200
I'll see you tomorrow.

38:43.960 --> 38:46.510
I've signed up several
new members so far,

38:46.560 --> 38:48.310
but we still need more.

38:48.360 --> 38:51.630
We rehearse at
the Community Centre every Friday.

38:51.680 --> 38:53.310
Everybody's welcome.

38:53.360 --> 38:55.750
I wish I could come.
I'm busy with Girls' Brigade.

38:55.800 --> 38:57.920
I think it's a wonderful enterprise.

38:59.600 --> 39:01.670
How's Alec?

39:01.720 --> 39:05.390
He's got a long road ahead of him
and he knows it.

39:05.440 --> 39:08.350
But he's being so brave.
I couldn't be prouder.

39:12.400 --> 39:15.510
What's this? Poplar Choral Society?

39:15.560 --> 39:18.630
I'm in the process of reviving it.
Well, you can count me in.

39:18.680 --> 39:20.710
And Alec too,
once he's out of hospital.

39:20.760 --> 39:22.390
Wonderful! Thank you.

39:22.440 --> 39:24.830
That was Mr Moss, Leah's husband.

39:24.880 --> 39:28.840
Leah thinks she's gone into labour
and I'm next on call.

39:31.120 --> 39:34.230
Well, if you wait while I change
into my uniform, I'll come with you.

39:34.280 --> 39:37.270
Don't you want to rest?
No. I want to work.

39:37.320 --> 39:40.190
I need to get back to normal now,
for Alec's sake.

39:40.240 --> 39:42.230
Oh. Good for you.

39:43.400 --> 39:46.150
Good girl, Leah!
Good girl. That's it.

39:47.640 --> 39:49.640
You're doing really well.

39:51.280 --> 39:53.160
Just going to listen to baby.

39:57.680 --> 40:00.510
Baby's heartbeat's
a little slower than I'd like.

40:00.560 --> 40:02.840
Nurse Lee. I must talk with you.

40:05.200 --> 40:07.070
Your friend, Mr Jesmond.

40:07.120 --> 40:08.790
He is gravely sick.

40:08.840 --> 40:11.670
But I saw him less than an hour ago.
What's happened?

40:11.720 --> 40:15.880
The Sister on the phone said you
should go now to the hospital.

40:17.440 --> 40:19.640
I'm sorry. But...

40:23.000 --> 40:24.790
Are they sending someone else?

40:26.920 --> 40:28.840
They...they didn't say so.

40:49.640 --> 40:51.430
Sister?

40:51.480 --> 40:52.920
Is everything all right?

40:55.760 --> 40:58.320
Mrs Rubin, I need you.

41:01.520 --> 41:04.720
We're going to welcome
a new life into this world.

41:05.880 --> 41:08.550
Into a family filled with love.

41:08.600 --> 41:10.510
And I need you to do
exactly as I tell you.

41:10.560 --> 41:11.830
Do you understand?

41:11.880 --> 41:13.190
Tell me what to do.

41:13.240 --> 41:14.800
Sit here.

41:20.640 --> 41:23.790
Leah, you're fully dilated now.

41:23.840 --> 41:25.910
The baby's heartbeat
is a little slow,

41:25.960 --> 41:27.550
so I want this baby out quickly.

41:27.600 --> 41:30.560
Now, push for me as hard as you can.

41:43.640 --> 41:44.910
The head's coming!

41:44.960 --> 41:47.030
I need you to pant for me.

41:47.080 --> 41:48.750
Good girl.

41:48.800 --> 41:50.310
There's the head.

41:50.360 --> 41:52.080
I can see the head!

41:53.240 --> 41:56.720
Now, I need you to give me
one more big push!

41:59.960 --> 42:02.470
That's wonderful, Leah.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.440
There we go!

42:09.600 --> 42:11.000
You've a little girl.

42:13.080 --> 42:14.830
You're a bubbe.

42:14.880 --> 42:16.350
Just going to cut the cord.

42:23.240 --> 42:25.720
Oh, I think I'm more
exhausted than you are!

42:27.800 --> 42:29.910
There we go.

42:29.960 --> 42:31.440
Oh, baby!

42:34.240 --> 42:35.840
She's beautiful.

42:39.160 --> 42:40.920
Oh, you're a darling.

42:45.840 --> 42:47.640
Congratulations!

42:51.560 --> 42:54.160
Hello. I'm your mummy.

42:55.520 --> 42:58.510
She looks like you.

42:58.560 --> 42:59.880
She looks like Tateh.

43:06.280 --> 43:10.270
We'll stay, here in the flat,
altogether.

43:23.480 --> 43:25.040
Sister?

43:26.480 --> 43:28.960
I'm sorry, Mr Jesmond
has just passed away.

43:31.840 --> 43:32.990
No. You're wrong.

43:33.040 --> 43:34.990
I was with him just
an hour ago and he was fine.

43:35.040 --> 43:38.550
I'm afraid there was a further...
You're wrong.
..complication with his fracture.

43:38.600 --> 43:42.280
The doctors suspect it was
an embolism that killed him.
I'm so sorry.

Jenny.

47:04.680 --> 47:06.040
I need to go to work.

47:07.160 --> 47:09.030
Please.

47:09.080 --> 47:11.190
You've been bereaved.

47:11.240 --> 47:14.830
I won't hear of any return to work
until after Alec's funeral.

47:14.880 --> 47:17.870
His parents won't
even be able to be there.

47:17.920 --> 47:20.790
They're stationed in Ceylon,
his father's at sea.

47:20.840 --> 47:23.030
No work for you today.

47:23.080 --> 47:25.990
You must rest and join us
in chapel if you wish to.

47:26.040 --> 47:27.510
Chapel?

47:27.560 --> 47:29.950
I just don't see where God
fits into any of this.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.480
God isn't in the event, Jenny.

47:33.760 --> 47:35.840
He is in the response to the event.

47:37.080 --> 47:40.870
In the love that is shown
and the care that is given.

47:40.920 --> 47:43.350
I wish I could argue with you.

47:43.400 --> 47:45.920
I wish I could think
of anything at all.

47:47.840 --> 47:50.550
Would you consider taking
compassionate leave?

47:50.600 --> 47:53.440
You could be our guest,
at the Mother House in Chichester.

47:54.560 --> 47:56.030
I...

47:56.080 --> 47:57.870
I might.

47:57.920 --> 48:00.680
You don't have to give
an answer now.

48:05.720 --> 48:09.470
Patrick. Would you look at
this manuscript for me?

48:09.520 --> 48:11.110
I haven't read music for years.

48:11.160 --> 48:13.110
You help Timothy with his piano.

48:13.160 --> 48:15.430
I've had to fiddle
with the tenor part,

48:15.480 --> 48:17.510
because I'm not sure
how many men will turn up.

48:17.560 --> 48:18.990
Turn up when?

48:19.040 --> 48:20.910
At choir practice. Tonight.

48:20.960 --> 48:23.590
I've said we'll sing
at Alec's funeral

48:23.640 --> 48:27.070
and I've absolutely no idea
how I'm going to pull it off.

48:27.120 --> 48:30.030
My love,
I can't rewrite choral music

48:30.080 --> 48:32.430
any more than I can fly to the moon.

48:32.480 --> 48:34.590
You could do your best.
I'm doing my best.

48:34.640 --> 48:36.630
If doing my best
made any difference,

48:36.680 --> 48:38.710
the choir wouldn't be
singing at a funeral.

48:38.760 --> 48:41.480
You are not to blame
for Alec's death.

48:43.000 --> 48:46.150
You did everything
you could for him.

48:46.200 --> 48:47.510
But somewhere else

48:47.560 --> 48:50.070
a decision was made that
no amount of prayer will change.

48:50.120 --> 48:52.280
And you have to accept that.

48:54.840 --> 48:56.640
That's what I can't bear.

48:58.120 --> 48:59.720
I know how that feels.

49:02.040 --> 49:04.040
I know you do.

49:07.360 --> 49:10.630
Baby's a beauty, that's for sure.

49:10.680 --> 49:14.030
They named her yesterday
at the synagogue.

49:14.080 --> 49:16.400
Elizabeth Malke.

49:30.440 --> 49:31.960
Mrs Rubin?

49:51.560 --> 49:52.760
Leah?

49:53.920 --> 49:55.080
Mama!

49:56.360 --> 50:00.590
What you want to bring the baby out
in that thin shmatte?

50:00.640 --> 50:02.440
She'll catch pneumonia!

51:00.880 --> 51:03.150
Is it all right if we bring
the prams in, Mrs Turner?

51:03.200 --> 51:05.550
Of course.
It's so good of you to come.

51:05.600 --> 51:07.830
We read about that
young man in the paper.

51:07.880 --> 51:10.270
It said his mother couldn't
make it to his funeral.

51:10.320 --> 51:11.550
Said she lives abroad.

51:11.600 --> 51:13.110
Yes. In Ceylon.

51:13.160 --> 51:14.750
Well, we're all mums now.

51:14.800 --> 51:16.230
We're doing this for her.

51:16.280 --> 51:17.680
Thank you.

51:19.040 --> 51:20.990
I'll go to the kitchen
and put the urn on.

51:21.040 --> 51:22.680
I knew it'd be a good turn-out.

51:25.440 --> 51:27.830
You came. We both wanted to.

51:27.880 --> 51:31.430
But Camilla's had to send apologies,
Freddie's teething.

51:31.480 --> 51:32.790
How's Jenny?

51:32.840 --> 51:34.510
Not too good, I'm afraid.

51:34.560 --> 51:36.990
I'm desperate to think of
a wise or profound word to help,

51:37.040 --> 51:39.950
but all I can feel is utter fury
and that's no help at all.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.910
Well, sometimes there's
nothing you can say.

51:41.960 --> 51:43.670
But there's always
something you can do.

51:43.720 --> 51:45.120
That's why we came tonight.

51:46.360 --> 51:48.830
Can everyone come
and take a seat, please,

51:48.880 --> 51:52.230
so we can go through the music
part by part first?

51:52.280 --> 51:54.630
We've chosen Mozart.

51:54.680 --> 51:58.870
Timothy, if you could play
the introduction for us, please.

52:04.320 --> 52:07.110
Jenny, are you sure about this?

52:07.160 --> 52:11.080
It's such a beautiful dress,
and you wanted it so much.

52:13.080 --> 52:15.390
I bought it for a weekend
that's never going to happen,

52:15.440 --> 52:17.870
with somebody I'm never
going to see again.

52:17.920 --> 52:19.870
I'm sure the shop will
exchange it for me.

52:19.920 --> 52:22.350
You don't have to wear black
to the funeral, Jenny.

52:22.400 --> 52:25.640
Cynthia, this is a dress
I was never meant to have.

52:26.960 --> 52:28.880
And I need you to help me.

52:30.560 --> 52:32.280
I'm right by your side.

52:36.680 --> 52:39.190
Just the person I was coming to see.

52:39.240 --> 52:40.470
Hello.

52:40.520 --> 52:42.520
I heard about your loss.

52:43.840 --> 52:45.470
We wish you long life.

52:45.520 --> 52:46.720
Thank you.

52:50.480 --> 52:52.230
She's beautiful.

52:52.280 --> 52:54.110
Thank you.

52:54.160 --> 52:56.110
Ah. So...

52:56.160 --> 52:57.870
You're out!

52:57.920 --> 53:01.270
You know, this bit of London
doesn't smell so good.

53:01.320 --> 53:02.390
Mama!

53:02.440 --> 53:06.510
In Golders Green,
I think it will be better.

53:06.560 --> 53:08.030
You're moving?

53:08.080 --> 53:10.560
Next week. All of us.

53:11.560 --> 53:14.750
Now, you'll think I'm a meshugenah,

53:14.800 --> 53:18.990
but I have a thing about goodbyes.

53:19.040 --> 53:23.150
I didn't get the chance
with so many of my own.

53:23.200 --> 53:25.960
Now I like to make sure
it's done proper.

53:27.880 --> 53:31.320
So, I say goodbye.

53:34.960 --> 53:37.310
I didn't get the chance, Mrs Rubin.

53:37.360 --> 53:38.950
Mama. You've said enough.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.750
You come along and leave
Nurse Lee in peace.

53:41.800 --> 53:44.560
What peace can she know now?

53:46.720 --> 53:50.190
You will feel better
than this, bubelah.

53:50.240 --> 53:53.400
Maybe not yet. But you will.

53:55.160 --> 53:56.590
Will I?

53:56.640 --> 53:58.590
Yes.

53:58.640 --> 54:04.120
You just keep living
until you're alive again.

54:09.640 --> 54:14.030
We cannot deny that
Alec Jesmond's death is tragic,

54:14.080 --> 54:16.910
especially at so young an age.

54:16.960 --> 54:20.190
We are all in need of God

54:20.240 --> 54:23.840
and His love is needed more
than ever at a time like this.

56:30.200 --> 56:31.800
from the Mother House.

56:37.200 --> 56:39.630
We've had a call from Joy Higgins
in Orient Buildings.

56:39.680 --> 56:41.390
Looks like baby's on the way.

56:41.440 --> 56:43.870
I should go! I'm first on call.

56:43.920 --> 56:46.710
You stay and wave Nurse Lee off.
I'll see to this one.

56:46.760 --> 56:49.080
You sure? Never more so.

56:51.560 --> 56:53.720
May you find peace, my dear.

57:06.320 --> 57:10.510
Say I'm weary, say I'm sad

57:10.560 --> 57:15.230
Say that health
and wealth have missed me

57:15.280 --> 57:21.270
Say I'm growing old, but add

57:21.320 --> 57:23.320
Jenny kissed me.

57:40.400 --> 57:42.910
'The doors of Nonnatus House

Help! Help!

58:03.920 --> 58:05.310
I've got a day off tomorrow.

58:05.360 --> 58:07.110
I thought we could
snuggle up on the sofa

58:07.160 --> 58:08.600
and listen to Take It From Here.

58:09.720 --> 58:12.270
I'm Patience Mount,
but people call me Patsy.

58:12.320 --> 58:16.270
I'd like my daughter examined.
I reckon she's in the family way.

58:16.320 --> 58:17.470
Surely not.

58:17.520 --> 58:19.070
I hate the word Mongol.

58:19.120 --> 58:21.560
