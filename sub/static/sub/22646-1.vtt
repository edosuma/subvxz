00:43.226 --> 00:44.226
Machi!

00:47.130 --> 00:48.530
Big brother...

00:57.007 --> 00:58.774
A rice ball.

01:03.613 --> 01:04.947
Machi

01:05.548 --> 01:08.917
that's a horse turd.
Put it down.

01:41.318 --> 01:42.718
Big brother!

01:53.129 --> 01:54.129
It's like

01:54.531 --> 01:57.766
you're staring at your own sin.

01:59.336 --> 02:01.070
Was it your fault?

02:03.506 --> 02:05.674
You're on a wanted poster.

02:07.644 --> 02:11.013
A constable
who killed his own master,

02:11.247 --> 02:13.349
a bannerman to the shogun.

02:14.684 --> 02:20.255
And six other constables
who happened to be there.

02:20.657 --> 02:22.725
<i>You're ferocious.</i>

02:23.026 --> 02:24.193
Husband!

02:25.062 --> 02:26.528
<i>Unfortunately...</i>

02:27.630 --> 02:29.965
<i>The sixth man was her husband.</i>

02:31.769 --> 02:37.206
I wanted to cut open my stomach
like a samurai should...

02:38.141 --> 02:43.445
But if I did that, she'd be left
to die in the dirt.

02:48.651 --> 02:49.918
It's hell.

02:51.688 --> 02:52.955
It's easier...

02:53.790 --> 02:58.460
When someone else decides life
or death for you.

03:00.697 --> 03:01.930
Me...

03:03.333 --> 03:06.502
I've been alive for 800 years.

03:09.305 --> 03:11.006
I understand

03:11.207 --> 03:13.075
how you feel.

03:21.918 --> 03:23.185
Machi?

03:28.691 --> 03:30.058
Machi, wait!

03:47.243 --> 03:49.445
I've found you at last...

03:50.780 --> 03:51.880
Manji.

03:53.149 --> 03:54.483
Big brother!

03:56.586 --> 04:00.155
I'm hishiyasu shido. I lead...

04:00.157 --> 04:03.459
No one's asked your name.

04:05.962 --> 04:07.563
Let machi go...

04:09.199 --> 04:11.767
And I'll let you go.

04:13.303 --> 04:14.970
Oh, you will?

04:15.772 --> 04:18.072
Gee, thanks!

04:18.641 --> 04:21.108
Like I'm going to let you go

04:22.445 --> 04:24.947
with a reward on your head?

04:26.483 --> 04:28.650
So drop your swords.

04:42.999 --> 04:45.667
Let her go.

04:46.936 --> 04:49.705
Let the poor girl go.

04:59.382 --> 05:00.716
Big brother...

05:08.424 --> 05:10.092
I let her go.

05:12.095 --> 05:14.029
She's dead, though.

05:27.076 --> 05:30.112
I'll kill all of you!

05:37.253 --> 05:38.954
Come and get me!

06:35.011 --> 06:36.478
Not bad!

06:36.480 --> 06:38.146
Put me down.

06:38.148 --> 06:39.581
Put me down.

06:39.583 --> 06:41.049
Go get him.

07:57.560 --> 08:00.128
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

08:58.621 --> 09:02.257
Time for you
to go find your sister.

09:12.435 --> 09:14.469
You bastard!

10:09.358 --> 10:10.458
Machi!

10:14.330 --> 10:15.530
I'm sorry!

10:26.409 --> 10:27.909
Crone...

10:29.712 --> 10:32.514
Take one of these swords...

10:33.783 --> 10:35.617
And kill me with it.

10:37.653 --> 10:39.855
Machi's dead.

10:44.327 --> 10:46.328
Life has no meaning now.

10:47.797 --> 10:50.632
After you've killed
all these men?

10:51.367 --> 10:53.969
How very self-centered.

10:54.570 --> 10:57.873
Just do it, will you!

11:03.012 --> 11:04.012
Ow!

11:04.213 --> 11:07.182
What are you doing, damn it?

11:07.483 --> 11:10.752
I said just stab me
and get it over with.

11:10.953 --> 11:14.389
My name is yaobikuni.

11:16.492 --> 11:23.565
And these are sacred bloodworms
born of the holy lama.

11:24.834 --> 11:28.637
They will live inside you.

11:45.087 --> 11:51.259
Blade of the immortal

11:52.762 --> 11:55.630
50 years later

12:17.186 --> 12:18.119
<i>rin?</i>

12:18.121 --> 12:23.325
I do wish you'd take more
interest in cooking and sewing.

12:23.993 --> 12:27.195
Our mutenichi-ryu school
licenses only one a generation.

12:27.730 --> 12:28.997
If I want to be that one,

12:28.999 --> 12:31.633
I can't miss even a day
of training.

12:42.445 --> 12:43.712
Rin!

12:44.246 --> 12:47.148
Can't you be more ladylike
when you eat?

12:48.818 --> 12:51.386
I'm going as slow as I can.

12:51.887 --> 12:54.656
Where did I go wrong?

12:55.791 --> 12:57.959
I'd hoped
you would grow up graceful,

12:58.094 --> 13:01.429
ready to partake of all the joys
of womanhood.

13:05.034 --> 13:07.602
Just write me off as a failure.

13:08.471 --> 13:09.771
Seconds.

13:48.811 --> 13:50.645
Who the hell are you?

13:54.050 --> 13:55.784
The itto-ryu.

13:57.386 --> 13:59.421
We care nothing for schools
or styles,

13:59.955 --> 14:01.589
and we use any kind of weapon.

14:01.824 --> 14:05.360
Our only aim is to win.

14:07.730 --> 14:12.867
So you're the ones
wrecking dojos all over edo?

14:13.736 --> 14:17.839
We will destroy all the schools
and unite them in one.

14:21.410 --> 14:22.510
Master asano...

14:24.246 --> 14:28.316
You will either join with us,
or be destroyed.

14:30.719 --> 14:32.187
Which will it be?

14:32.521 --> 14:33.621
Nonsense!

14:35.091 --> 14:37.125
Are you out of your mind?

14:38.227 --> 14:41.596
Just so you know,
we've killed all your disciples.

14:44.033 --> 14:45.834
You're the only one left.

14:47.403 --> 14:48.536
What?

14:49.505 --> 14:52.841
We believe
in fighting one against one.

14:54.844 --> 14:56.244
If you wish...

15:00.015 --> 15:02.584
I will stand against you.

15:34.750 --> 15:35.917
Lightweight.

15:57.673 --> 15:58.873
Master anotsu...

15:59.975 --> 16:01.543
What about those two?

16:03.012 --> 16:04.379
Do as you like.

16:05.848 --> 16:07.649
Don't touch the girl, though.

16:08.751 --> 16:11.886
Sporting
with children is vulgar.

16:41.116 --> 16:42.317
No!

16:42.952 --> 16:43.985
Mother!

16:46.555 --> 16:47.755
Close your eyes.

16:48.691 --> 16:50.792
Block your ears.

16:52.528 --> 16:57.131
What happens now
will drive you mad.

17:57.059 --> 17:58.526
Girl...

18:00.362 --> 18:03.298
Who is it that sleeps there?

18:06.335 --> 18:07.402
My father.

18:07.536 --> 18:09.837
Why isn't your mother here?

18:12.374 --> 18:14.642
The day my father was killed...

18:16.612 --> 18:18.346
She disappeared.

18:21.817 --> 18:23.151
Ah!

18:23.686 --> 18:27.488
And what do you intend
to do now, girl?

18:28.724 --> 18:30.391
Find my mother...

18:31.360 --> 18:33.194
<i>And kill those men.</i>

18:35.998 --> 18:37.332
Leave me alone!

18:37.633 --> 18:40.401
That's why I train every day.

18:42.104 --> 18:43.404
Girl...

18:45.174 --> 18:47.108
Hire a bodyguard.

18:49.278 --> 18:54.982
There is a man somewhere
in edo who will never die.

18:56.085 --> 18:58.986
Find that man.

19:43.365 --> 19:45.733
Would he be in a place like that?

19:56.645 --> 19:58.579
Man

20:05.921 --> 20:07.155
are you manji?

20:17.166 --> 20:18.499
Machi!

20:36.618 --> 20:39.487
Please! I saw you use a sword.

20:40.389 --> 20:42.590
Help me avenge my father.

20:45.227 --> 20:47.161
Who told you about me?

20:48.931 --> 20:53.201
An old lady named yaobikuni.
She said you will never die.

20:53.203 --> 20:55.369
She'll say anything.

20:55.371 --> 21:00.174
I don't know where to find
the itto-ryu

21:01.143 --> 21:03.244
but they attack other dojos,

21:03.246 --> 21:05.146
so they're sure
to reveal themselves.

21:06.215 --> 21:07.181
Please!

21:07.183 --> 21:11.752
Go home before it gets dark.
There are bandits around here.

21:12.321 --> 21:13.454
I'll pay you...

21:13.456 --> 21:15.223
It's not about money.

21:17.960 --> 21:23.030
If I kill just because you ask,
I'm nothing but a murderer.

21:25.367 --> 21:29.871
How do I decide who to kill?

21:38.480 --> 21:39.947
The itto-ryu...

21:41.984 --> 21:45.753
Killed my father,
and took my mother away.

21:48.724 --> 21:49.757
So...

21:51.326 --> 21:54.562
In your mind this 'anotsu'
is evil...

21:55.898 --> 21:57.798
And you're good?

22:00.235 --> 22:02.136
Uh?

22:02.738 --> 22:05.239
How convenient!

22:07.075 --> 22:08.142
Think.

22:09.711 --> 22:13.548
If they're master swordsmen...

22:14.616 --> 22:16.884
They won't kill without reason.

22:21.757 --> 22:23.324
This isn't about logic!

22:24.493 --> 22:26.260
Or good or evil!

22:26.762 --> 22:28.896
I want you to kill them!

22:34.469 --> 22:40.708
I'm desolate.
There were so many of them...

22:48.250 --> 22:49.650
So...

22:52.354 --> 22:54.956
Would you give anything?

23:07.936 --> 23:09.604
Then show me.

23:14.476 --> 23:15.977
If you're that desolate..

23:17.079 --> 23:20.381
Then show me
how determined you are.

23:26.421 --> 23:28.656
But...

23:29.458 --> 23:30.791
What's wrong?

23:34.196 --> 23:35.630
So it's all talk?

24:11.533 --> 24:13.167
Don't get me wrong.

24:14.403 --> 24:15.903
You're just a kid.

24:35.891 --> 24:37.024
Wait!

24:38.827 --> 24:41.162
There are bandits, I said.

24:43.432 --> 24:46.701
I'm not doing anything.
I'll walk you back to town.

24:49.304 --> 24:50.805
It's been a while.

24:52.307 --> 24:55.209
Maybe on the way I'll find
someone to practice on.

25:12.861 --> 25:17.832
"Like sand, like long black hair..."

25:18.767 --> 25:22.503
Like the brief flutter
of a butterfly o'er the sea...

25:23.238 --> 25:27.842
Weeping in desolation,
I look at the sky.

25:28.877 --> 25:35.950
All I am now,
homesick and dreaming.

25:36.752 --> 25:39.987
"Kuroi sabato."

25:40.689 --> 25:42.690
You've been leaving me
love letters

25:42.692 --> 25:45.793
every month for two years now.

25:46.561 --> 25:48.395
You're driving me crazy.

25:48.997 --> 25:51.532
Ever since that night...

25:52.734 --> 25:57.304
When you trembled,
weeping in my arms...

25:59.975 --> 26:02.409
I have burned with love for you.

26:04.346 --> 26:10.084
With these hands I will kill you
and make you forever mine.

26:11.319 --> 26:13.420
For me, this is...

26:14.422 --> 26:16.557
Love at its ultimate.

26:18.794 --> 26:19.894
What's that?

26:19.896 --> 26:24.965
A lock of the hair
of lady toki, your mother.

26:26.701 --> 26:28.769
The sport of my companions

26:28.771 --> 26:32.573
left her wretched
in the extreme,

26:33.475 --> 26:35.810
so I took the Liberty.

26:36.778 --> 26:37.945
Rin?

26:41.183 --> 26:42.249
Rin?

26:49.457 --> 26:51.091
I'm here.

27:00.302 --> 27:01.836
I'll kill you.

27:04.706 --> 27:06.140
Kuroi sabato!

27:07.876 --> 27:12.012
If I have to fall into hell
to do it, I will kill you!

27:23.258 --> 27:27.528
Doesn't that send shivers
down the spine!

27:29.130 --> 27:32.666
Against a girl young enough
to be your daughter?

27:33.001 --> 27:34.535
Keep out of it.

27:35.804 --> 27:38.505
This is our magic moment.

27:54.155 --> 27:57.157
Don't you walk away from me!

28:10.772 --> 28:13.274
Where is anotsu kagehisa?

28:15.310 --> 28:17.011
Tell me or you die.

28:32.394 --> 28:33.594
Manji!

28:37.132 --> 28:38.666
You were careless.

28:40.201 --> 28:43.737
I've trained myself
to twist my shoulders

28:43.739 --> 28:45.406
all the way around.

28:56.785 --> 28:59.620
So let's have
no more foolishness.

29:08.263 --> 29:11.398
Get your dirty hands off her!

29:29.484 --> 29:30.651
What are you?

29:31.286 --> 29:32.987
A monster?

29:54.142 --> 29:58.445
You're lucky. You can die.

30:02.617 --> 30:05.285
Manji! You healed up!

30:05.620 --> 30:06.787
Bloodworms.

30:09.157 --> 30:11.558
That old cow put them in me.

30:14.496 --> 30:16.497
They keep me alive.

30:20.568 --> 30:25.239
I find it
pretty disgusting myself.

30:52.267 --> 30:54.168
This isn't the time to cry.

30:56.805 --> 30:59.239
If you want revenge...

31:00.642 --> 31:03.077
You need to beat these.

31:06.347 --> 31:09.650
Tomorrow you start training.
All right?

31:12.554 --> 31:13.754
Yes.

31:38.113 --> 31:40.314
But if you want a shoulder
to cry on,

31:41.549 --> 31:43.150
borrow mine for a bit.

32:19.354 --> 32:22.856
Why is the man who leads
the itto-ryu...

32:23.958 --> 32:29.930
Hiding out away from town
like this?

32:32.033 --> 32:34.701
I went to
great pains to find you.

32:35.970 --> 32:39.239
I'm told many men seek my head.

32:41.142 --> 32:42.543
Master anotsu...

32:44.412 --> 32:47.848
Why have you brought
the itto-ryu to this?

32:50.285 --> 32:52.119
In a time of peace,

32:52.820 --> 32:54.788
fencing schools are only a way
of making a living.

32:57.125 --> 33:00.227
I believe that
only those dedicated

33:01.262 --> 33:02.930
to making themselves powerful...

33:03.831 --> 33:06.333
Deserve the name "swordsman".

33:08.903 --> 33:10.737
I wish to break down...

33:11.906 --> 33:14.508
The barriers between schools.

33:16.377 --> 33:17.911
I see.

33:19.714 --> 33:23.550
My judgment seems
to have been correct.

33:27.188 --> 33:30.657
As it happens, master anotsu...

33:32.994 --> 33:35.862
We wish to start
a fencing school

33:35.864 --> 33:40.267
for officials of the shogunate.

33:43.071 --> 33:49.743
We would very much like you and
the swordsmen of the itto-ryu...

33:50.979 --> 33:55.582
To serve as instructors
in this academy.

34:00.855 --> 34:02.823
On certain conditions.

34:04.259 --> 34:05.926
"Conditions?"

34:07.862 --> 34:11.297
That the academy
will be named "itto-ryu"...

34:12.132 --> 34:17.371
And that I am appointed head
of the academy.

34:20.541 --> 34:23.043
If I were not sure
of my abilities...

34:25.146 --> 34:27.047
I would not ask this.

34:29.550 --> 34:34.353
I will ask
the council of elders...

34:36.257 --> 34:37.658
For their opinion.

34:39.159 --> 34:41.594
I ask for time to do this.

34:55.476 --> 34:58.345
Is master anotsu here?

34:59.113 --> 35:00.380
Yes.

35:01.316 --> 35:02.816
<i>Sabato's dead.</i>

35:03.351 --> 35:04.951
<i>Who killed him?</i>

35:05.620 --> 35:08.388
He was around asano's a lot.

35:09.457 --> 35:13.460
Surely not asano's daughter?

35:15.063 --> 35:20.734
He was one of our ten best men.

35:21.969 --> 35:24.938
That girl could never take him.

35:25.239 --> 35:28.041
This is an important time for us.

35:30.211 --> 35:34.648
Tell everyone
to keep their wits about them.

35:38.086 --> 35:39.786
These, please.

35:40.588 --> 35:43.357
Very interesting!

35:43.825 --> 35:46.493
In 50 years
of sharpening swords,

35:46.728 --> 35:51.365
I've never had any that smelled
of innards like these do.

35:51.866 --> 35:55.702
Most samurai don't use
their swords that much.

36:00.842 --> 36:03.910
<i>Anyway, it'll cost two ryo.</i>

36:04.212 --> 36:07.481
- I'll need three days.
- Thank you.

36:21.462 --> 36:23.163
<i>You know swords?</i>

36:23.965 --> 36:26.566
That one's famous.

36:32.573 --> 36:34.941
Grinder! Is it ready yet?

36:35.710 --> 36:38.145
I'll be right with you.

36:47.688 --> 36:51.258
You did quite a job
getting it this sharp.

36:51.559 --> 36:53.193
Thank you.

36:57.098 --> 36:59.533
Come back anytime.

37:14.315 --> 37:16.516
What's all the rush?

37:19.720 --> 37:23.757
I found a man
with my father's sword!

37:27.862 --> 37:29.196
Where is he?

37:30.598 --> 37:32.699
Near sensoji temple.

37:43.110 --> 37:44.878
You stay here.

38:00.862 --> 38:03.997
Are you the one
who killed sabato?

38:07.902 --> 38:09.169
What if I am?

38:10.505 --> 38:11.938
Who hired you?

38:12.206 --> 38:13.907
Asano's girl?

38:14.342 --> 38:15.909
Who cares?

38:16.711 --> 38:19.145
You're going to die, too.

38:20.948 --> 38:22.616
Blow it out your ass.

38:34.795 --> 38:36.162
Lesson one.

38:37.198 --> 38:41.735
"Eighty per cent of victory
is blocking your opponent."

38:48.309 --> 38:49.910
That could hurt.

39:11.432 --> 39:13.934
I was born around here.

39:15.269 --> 39:16.703
When I was a kid,

39:16.705 --> 39:20.574
I found a friend drowned
in a patch of quicksand.

39:22.276 --> 39:24.444
Right where you're standing now.

39:28.115 --> 39:29.649
Lesson two.

39:31.385 --> 39:35.288
"Know the land, conquer all."

39:43.197 --> 39:44.798
To continue,

39:45.266 --> 39:47.267
I was a peasant's son.

39:49.804 --> 39:53.974
One day we were kicking
a ball around.

39:55.242 --> 39:58.178
A lord's procession came along.

39:59.547 --> 40:01.648
She kicked the ball
the wrong way,

40:01.849 --> 40:05.151
and it startled
his lordship's horse.

40:06.587 --> 40:09.956
They cut her right in two.

40:13.995 --> 40:15.095
But,

40:15.529 --> 40:18.665
there's nothing
a peasant can say.

40:21.335 --> 40:23.637
It's not fair, is it?

40:28.442 --> 40:31.277
You were a samurai.
You're my enemy.

40:33.648 --> 40:36.049
So is the girl who hired you.

40:45.726 --> 40:49.362
Now I'm going to kill her, too.

40:55.436 --> 40:57.037
Think so?

41:36.777 --> 41:38.378
I'm afraid...

41:39.480 --> 41:42.982
You're not the only hero
of a sad story.

42:04.438 --> 42:06.072
By the way, spiky...

42:08.142 --> 42:09.809
What's your name?

42:14.048 --> 42:18.785
Magatsu taito.

42:30.598 --> 42:32.766
- Manji!
- Ow!

42:32.768 --> 42:34.534
Don't touch me!

42:36.270 --> 42:38.371
The wounds haven't closed.

42:40.374 --> 42:41.541
Sorry.

42:46.213 --> 42:47.280
Here.

42:55.489 --> 42:56.890
Sorry.

42:58.292 --> 42:59.959
I got blood on it.

43:11.840 --> 43:17.210
Thank you for bringing back
my father's sword.

43:24.518 --> 43:26.152
Machi...

43:28.756 --> 43:30.857
Don't look at me like that.

43:34.495 --> 43:35.995
Machi?

43:39.200 --> 43:40.366
My sister.

43:44.505 --> 43:47.106
She died years ago.

43:51.245 --> 43:53.012
I look like her?

43:55.916 --> 43:59.085
That's why you looked so shocked
when you first saw me.

44:09.563 --> 44:12.165
No matter how bad the memory...

44:14.602 --> 44:20.940
Sometimes just remembering
it gives you incredible power.

44:25.679 --> 44:30.917
That's how
I won again this time.

44:35.689 --> 44:39.659
So treasure that sword
as a memento...

44:41.595 --> 44:43.162
Of your father.

44:46.734 --> 44:50.003
- Brother's stupid!
- What did you say?

44:50.704 --> 44:52.372
I won't say it again.

44:56.877 --> 45:00.013
I look like her, don't I?

45:05.719 --> 45:08.288
It's not fair that only I cry.

45:09.423 --> 45:12.725
You've got things
to cry about, too.

45:12.727 --> 45:15.028
Me cry? Forget that.

45:15.596 --> 45:18.064
I'm not some stupid kid.

45:18.999 --> 45:20.400
And anyway...

45:21.568 --> 45:23.469
She didn't call me that.

45:24.738 --> 45:26.940
It wasn't "brother".

45:27.875 --> 45:30.176
She said "big brother".

45:32.780 --> 45:34.247
Big brother...

45:39.420 --> 45:42.055
- Big brother!
- Shut up!

45:44.758 --> 45:46.592
Big brother, manji!

46:00.174 --> 46:02.742
Magatsu? We're coming in.

46:10.451 --> 46:14.988
Asano's daughter hired
this incredible bodyguard.

46:16.390 --> 46:18.257
An immortal warrior.

46:20.794 --> 46:22.228
"Immortal"?

46:26.000 --> 46:27.900
Stab him through the heart,

46:28.435 --> 46:31.304
and some weird worms
close the wound.

46:33.874 --> 46:35.575
He's not human.

46:36.744 --> 46:38.177
He's a monster.

46:48.389 --> 46:51.657
I'm hungry.
Let's have some dumplings.

46:52.926 --> 46:54.427
Manji.

46:56.263 --> 46:57.363
What?

47:01.802 --> 47:05.571
Don't you have any money?

47:06.273 --> 47:10.777
Say so, then.
I'll have tea instead of sake.

47:11.545 --> 47:13.246
Sorry, manji.

47:14.014 --> 47:15.782
I need the privy.

47:17.818 --> 47:18.951
One tea.

47:24.224 --> 47:27.160
Mmm.

47:27.828 --> 47:30.463
She's looked everywhere.

47:38.772 --> 47:43.409
That's something very
interesting you're looking at.

47:44.445 --> 47:49.182
You're standing in the light,
monk.

47:49.850 --> 47:56.155
Each of those circles marks
a well-known edo dojo.

47:56.457 --> 47:59.125
All of them recently forced
to submit

47:59.127 --> 48:03.029
to a certain school of fencing.

48:03.997 --> 48:09.001
For a monk you're well-informed
on the affairs of this world.

48:09.203 --> 48:11.938
I know even more than that.

48:11.940 --> 48:15.608
The whereabouts of the man
you two seek.

48:16.810 --> 48:18.778
Anotsu kagehisa.

48:19.446 --> 48:25.184
Depending on your answer,
I might tell you where he is.

48:25.953 --> 48:28.354
You said, "you two".

48:29.356 --> 48:32.225
How did you know I wasn't alone?

48:33.694 --> 48:36.362
So you are manji.

48:42.369 --> 48:46.906
Shizuma eiku,
swordsman of the itto-ryu.

48:50.511 --> 48:55.381
So manji...
How about joining up with me?

48:55.983 --> 48:58.784
What are you talking about?

48:58.952 --> 49:01.154
We rub out anotsu.

49:04.858 --> 49:06.792
Don't get me wrong.

49:07.294 --> 49:10.263
I bear him no grudge.

49:10.597 --> 49:11.764
Far from it.

49:12.199 --> 49:15.468
I have great respect
for his strength of purpose.

49:15.669 --> 49:19.372
And courage and skill
far beyond his years.

49:19.973 --> 49:24.477
A man gifted enough to do that
would still only be human.

49:24.611 --> 49:27.980
He could die
with his goal unreached.

49:28.182 --> 49:32.885
But with you, that would not be
a matter of concern.

49:34.688 --> 49:37.957
Did a guy called magatsu
tell you about me?

49:38.692 --> 49:43.963
Neither you, nor I
could take anotsu ourselves.

49:44.164 --> 49:48.334
- But together...
- I'll let you live.

49:49.002 --> 49:50.536
Now get lost.

49:51.371 --> 49:53.339
Is that your answer?

49:53.974 --> 49:56.542
A gut feeling tells me...

49:58.378 --> 50:01.414
Not to hook up with you.

50:04.651 --> 50:09.822
And I thought we'd have
a meeting of minds.

50:38.952 --> 50:41.420
Manji? Are you all right?

50:42.155 --> 50:43.856
Just a scratch.

50:46.627 --> 50:48.361
Itto-ryu?

50:49.096 --> 50:50.463
Yeah.

50:52.399 --> 50:54.867
Sorry about this.

51:22.929 --> 51:24.630
I'll say it again.

51:25.732 --> 51:30.870
You and I should understand
each other better.

51:32.139 --> 51:34.640
She got to you, too?

51:43.684 --> 51:49.088
Long before I had anything to do
with the itto-ryu.

51:50.190 --> 51:51.691
How long?

51:52.359 --> 51:54.560
Two hundred years or so.

51:55.028 --> 51:56.429
Two hundred?

51:57.698 --> 52:01.701
I've seen whole ages
come and go.

52:02.569 --> 52:09.442
I've had five wives,
and more than that in friends.

52:13.013 --> 52:15.448
All dead, while I remain.

52:22.923 --> 52:25.458
Death is merciless.

52:26.660 --> 52:27.793
But...

52:29.129 --> 52:33.766
Never dying is far worse.

52:38.205 --> 52:41.907
I will ignore the answer
you just gave me.

52:43.210 --> 52:45.111
Think it over.

52:48.949 --> 52:50.049
Manji?

52:52.085 --> 52:53.486
You're bleeding.

52:59.926 --> 53:01.160
Are you okay?

53:02.162 --> 53:04.029
Ah.

53:13.473 --> 53:15.641
- Manji!
- Look away!

53:16.910 --> 53:18.778
That bastard!

53:20.347 --> 53:22.715
<i>He had something</i>

53:23.283 --> 53:24.984
on his sword.

53:26.720 --> 53:30.489
It's weakened the bloodworms.

53:30.757 --> 53:32.391
You're bleeding!

53:32.393 --> 53:34.927
- I'll get a doctor.
- That won't help!

53:35.295 --> 53:38.564
- But you'll die!
- No, rin!

53:38.765 --> 53:40.099
Stay here!

53:51.711 --> 53:54.447
<i>Why do you need him that much?</i>

53:55.515 --> 54:02.221
What I need
is a man just like me.

54:04.758 --> 54:06.091
Or perhaps...

54:10.163 --> 54:12.965
You'd like to qualify?

54:45.098 --> 54:46.432
Lick it.

54:47.033 --> 54:50.803
If two people
bring new wounds together,

54:51.171 --> 54:56.075
their blood will mingle,
and the worms will migrate.

55:00.313 --> 55:01.680
Go on.

55:20.133 --> 55:21.934
I wish it were true.

55:22.068 --> 55:28.908
If it were that easy,
I'd never have lost anyone.

55:56.303 --> 55:57.870
Manji.

55:59.306 --> 56:04.977
Lay one finger on rin,
and I'll cut you in pieces.

56:06.479 --> 56:09.782
Then I'll wipe out the itto-ryu
root and branch.

56:14.321 --> 56:15.588
Step outside.

56:15.855 --> 56:19.692
Is that your final answer?

56:20.493 --> 56:23.729
It's a perfect moon
for last rites.

57:48.882 --> 57:53.752
Dying's hard, isn't it?

58:19.846 --> 58:22.247
The only thing
I share with you...

58:28.354 --> 58:30.789
Is this pain.

58:37.163 --> 58:40.966
If I can't win you over,
there's no help for it.

58:41.534 --> 58:45.904
I knew you put something
on your sword.

58:46.339 --> 58:48.240
Bloodworm poison.

58:48.808 --> 58:52.544
I found it when I was wandering
in Tibet.

58:55.548 --> 58:58.417
It weakens the bloodworms.

58:58.818 --> 59:00.953
Enough of it...

59:02.722 --> 59:05.924
Can even kill us.

59:13.533 --> 59:16.034
So we could die?

59:21.341 --> 59:22.841
Manji!

59:34.187 --> 59:35.554
But I can't.

59:57.877 --> 01:00:00.546
Rot, you old bastard!

01:00:21.167 --> 01:00:22.301
I guess...

01:00:23.469 --> 01:00:27.139
The worms don't love me anymore.

01:00:30.977 --> 01:00:34.146
Why did you stay silent
and let me cut into you?

01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:40.018
You could have dodged.

01:00:44.490 --> 01:00:47.059
You know why.

01:00:49.128 --> 01:00:50.395
I'm tired...

01:00:57.036 --> 01:00:59.271
Of being alive.

01:02:14.614 --> 01:02:19.184
The council of elders has agreed

01:02:19.519 --> 01:02:22.020
to your conditions.

01:02:24.290 --> 01:02:27.392
<i>Your dearest wish
is about to come true.</i>

01:02:28.194 --> 01:02:32.497
Abayama, I will pay a visit
to mt takao.

01:02:33.466 --> 01:02:34.666
Mt takao?

01:02:43.977 --> 01:02:48.447
"Ibane kensui,
head of the shinkeito-ryu"?

01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:51.683
The shinkeito-ryu used to serve

01:02:51.918 --> 01:02:56.288
as official instructors
to the shoguns.

01:02:57.123 --> 01:02:58.824
Its leader wishes his name added

01:02:58.826 --> 01:03:02.194
to the list
of itto-ryu comrades.

01:03:05.031 --> 01:03:07.232
Is this true?

01:03:09.068 --> 01:03:14.039
Apparently he is ill,
with little time left to live.

01:03:15.742 --> 01:03:17.275
He believes...

01:03:18.244 --> 01:03:19.945
His task is to foster
true warriors

01:03:19.947 --> 01:03:22.180
able to fight
in the upheavals...

01:03:23.149 --> 01:03:25.350
Coming to this land.

01:03:27.153 --> 01:03:32.357
The itto-ryu is the only school
able to carry out that task.

01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:39.097
That is what master kensui says
in his letter.

01:03:41.968 --> 01:03:43.435
I see.

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:52.611
And now all the other schools
will have to follow our lead.

01:03:56.049 --> 01:03:58.350
In name and by deed,

01:03:59.352 --> 01:04:01.486
the itto-ryu will be supreme
in all edo!

01:04:03.489 --> 01:04:06.124
Master anotsu!
We've been hit again.

01:04:07.193 --> 01:04:09.828
Tamazaki, bando, and shimizu.

01:04:11.731 --> 01:04:13.365
Three in one night?

01:04:13.367 --> 01:04:16.368
Probably that "hundred killer".

01:04:16.936 --> 01:04:18.270
Abayama,

01:04:18.272 --> 01:04:20.839
tell everyone to stay
as close together as possible.

01:04:21.374 --> 01:04:24.509
But we can't just do nothing...

01:04:25.044 --> 01:04:26.378
I'll call in help.

01:05:30.943 --> 01:05:33.445
They still won't heal!

01:05:35.481 --> 01:05:36.882
Manji!

01:05:37.984 --> 01:05:40.552
Your wounds
haven't closed up yet!

01:05:41.687 --> 01:05:44.489
Sake's the best medicine.

01:05:47.226 --> 01:05:53.365
The bloodworms get drunk
and have a good time.

01:06:09.116 --> 01:06:10.649
There's the money.

01:06:39.579 --> 01:06:40.946
Hey, brother...

01:06:44.383 --> 01:06:46.618
Got some time for me?

01:06:49.255 --> 01:06:51.523
No, thanks. I've been sick.

01:06:53.025 --> 01:06:55.527
Just for a little while.

01:06:56.529 --> 01:06:58.563
Come with me.

01:07:05.905 --> 01:07:07.872
Rin, go on back home.

01:07:08.808 --> 01:07:09.774
Huh?

01:07:12.078 --> 01:07:14.512
What does he see
in that old hag?

01:07:22.688 --> 01:07:24.823
No one can see us here.

01:07:26.892 --> 01:07:28.593
Let's have some fun.

01:07:41.007 --> 01:07:48.413
Forgive this late introduction.
My name is otonotachibana makie.

01:07:49.215 --> 01:07:50.682
I am pledged

01:07:51.384 --> 01:07:54.953
as a warrior to anotsu kagehisa,
leader of the itto-ryu.

01:07:56.455 --> 01:07:59.824
You stand in his way.
I am here...

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:03.361
To remove you.

01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:06.698
So I see.

01:08:07.533 --> 01:08:09.634
In this past seven days,

01:08:09.769 --> 01:08:14.039
13 itto-ryu men
have been slaughtered.

01:08:15.441 --> 01:08:17.942
That number deserves death.

01:08:18.711 --> 01:08:19.844
Thirteen?

01:08:21.212 --> 01:08:23.381
There must be some mistake.

01:08:24.116 --> 01:08:25.517
I've only...

01:08:35.661 --> 01:08:38.796
I haven't finished talking yet.

01:09:23.209 --> 01:09:25.109
That could hurt!

01:10:46.158 --> 01:10:49.127
Where did that bitch go?

01:12:38.537 --> 01:12:40.138
What's wrong?

01:12:42.908 --> 01:12:46.344
Hurry up and get it over with.

01:12:47.513 --> 01:12:50.348
What's the problem
all of a sudden?

01:13:08.635 --> 01:13:10.835
When I fight I forget...

01:13:11.971 --> 01:13:16.641
But then I come to myself,
and what I've done terrifies me.

01:13:18.777 --> 01:13:21.045
What are you talking about?

01:13:25.184 --> 01:13:29.220
My skill with the sword
brings only grief!

01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:35.293
But kagehisa won't let me
lay it down.

01:13:36.795 --> 01:13:42.033
He needs me
to make his dreams come true.

01:13:42.401 --> 01:13:43.735
But...

01:13:45.471 --> 01:13:50.308
When I wonder if what he wants
is the right thing or not...

01:13:52.277 --> 01:13:54.312
I lose all will to fight.

01:13:54.314 --> 01:13:55.880
Manji!

01:13:58.951 --> 01:14:00.518
Out of the way!

01:14:00.719 --> 01:14:02.887
Wait until I tell you.

01:14:05.157 --> 01:14:08.893
You're rin?

01:14:11.597 --> 01:14:13.231
Tell me...

01:14:16.035 --> 01:14:22.440
How many have died now
in your quest for revenge?

01:14:26.945 --> 01:14:30.014
Aren't you scared
by what you've done?

01:14:31.450 --> 01:14:33.951
I swore on my father's grave...

01:14:36.255 --> 01:14:38.256
I'd avenge him!

01:14:40.592 --> 01:14:42.160
I'd commit...

01:14:43.829 --> 01:14:46.230
Any manner of foul deeds!

01:14:49.968 --> 01:14:51.169
Of course...

01:14:52.471 --> 01:14:55.440
I don't think killing is right.

01:14:57.142 --> 01:15:01.312
But do right and wrong matter

01:15:01.714 --> 01:15:04.315
when it's for people you love?

01:15:08.087 --> 01:15:09.754
Manji's the same.

01:15:11.757 --> 01:15:14.292
He's killed lots of people.

01:15:16.562 --> 01:15:17.929
But...

01:15:19.031 --> 01:15:22.333
Right now he's risking his life
for me!

01:15:25.237 --> 01:15:27.071
I can't let him die.

01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:30.308
I just can't!

01:15:51.563 --> 01:15:53.998
I can't kill a child like you.

01:16:06.712 --> 01:16:08.246
Please...

01:16:10.315 --> 01:16:12.483
Look after her.

01:16:31.570 --> 01:16:33.771
The healing's still slow.

01:16:33.906 --> 01:16:35.573
Don't worry your head.

01:16:36.508 --> 01:16:37.909
More important...

01:16:40.245 --> 01:16:42.280
What am I to you?

01:16:45.250 --> 01:16:50.855
I can't have you risking
your life for a bodyguard.

01:16:52.291 --> 01:16:55.226
But if I hadn't...

01:16:55.228 --> 01:16:59.597
I wanted to get her off guard
and attack her then.

01:17:05.838 --> 01:17:10.608
Do that again and I quit.

01:17:25.490 --> 01:17:27.491
I couldn't kill him.

01:17:31.396 --> 01:17:33.130
I am not fit...

01:17:34.733 --> 01:17:37.034
To stand at your side.

01:18:29.321 --> 01:18:30.588
Manji?

01:18:35.661 --> 01:18:39.463
Breakfast's ready.
Go wash your face.

01:18:49.107 --> 01:18:51.142
I've got something to do.

01:18:53.312 --> 01:18:55.112
Train alone today.

01:18:58.750 --> 01:19:00.117
Okay.

01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:29.480
Machi...

01:19:34.486 --> 01:19:38.255
It looks like
I might be joining you soon.

01:19:47.432 --> 01:19:49.000
Or not.

01:20:13.091 --> 01:20:16.160
<i>Anotsu kagehisa!
Why is he here?</i>

01:20:35.947 --> 01:20:37.581
Anotsu kagehisa!

01:20:39.918 --> 01:20:41.185
Now you die!

01:20:49.561 --> 01:20:51.195
Do you want to die?

01:20:59.738 --> 01:21:01.105
Huh?

01:21:15.954 --> 01:21:19.557
Are you asano's girl?

01:21:21.126 --> 01:21:23.227
Where's your bodyguard?

01:21:24.863 --> 01:21:27.098
Kill me if you want.

01:21:33.371 --> 01:21:35.473
This was my grandfather's axe.

01:21:37.742 --> 01:21:41.378
Your great-grandfather
expelled him from his school...

01:21:44.816 --> 01:21:47.384
For using a foreign weapon.

01:21:49.721 --> 01:21:51.555
I killed your father...

01:21:53.525 --> 01:21:55.726
To avenge him.

01:21:56.962 --> 01:21:58.195
What do you mean?

01:21:58.363 --> 01:22:00.898
Our grandfathers were competing

01:22:01.166 --> 01:22:04.435
to be licensed
by the mutenichi-ryu.

01:22:07.105 --> 01:22:08.372
One night...

01:22:09.274 --> 01:22:14.512
A gang of bandits attacked them
and your great-grandfather.

01:22:15.380 --> 01:22:20.518
Your grandfather killed four,
and mine killed nine.

01:22:23.688 --> 01:22:25.055
But then...

01:22:25.223 --> 01:22:26.423
<i>Why?</i>

01:22:27.092 --> 01:22:29.827
My skill exceeds your son's!

01:22:29.829 --> 01:22:32.530
Why do you do this?

01:22:32.864 --> 01:22:35.166
It is not our style.

01:22:37.135 --> 01:22:38.435
Anotsu...

01:22:40.005 --> 01:22:43.307
Your style
is not even swordsmanship.

01:22:44.609 --> 01:22:46.210
But why now?

01:22:49.281 --> 01:22:52.316
Because takayuki is your son?

01:22:53.285 --> 01:22:55.386
You never intended

01:22:55.587 --> 01:22:58.956
to Grant license
to an outsider like me?

01:22:58.958 --> 01:22:59.990
Silence!

01:23:00.292 --> 01:23:02.459
Axes are for barbarians!

01:23:02.661 --> 01:23:03.894
Not for us!

01:23:03.896 --> 01:23:07.598
I only used that to defend you!

01:23:08.633 --> 01:23:10.601
Get your hands off me!

01:23:11.903 --> 01:23:13.938
Master! I...

01:23:15.073 --> 01:23:17.608
I defended you, damn it!

01:23:19.844 --> 01:23:20.878
And so...

01:23:22.113 --> 01:23:24.682
He came to a miserable end.

01:23:27.586 --> 01:23:29.420
No one cared.

01:23:34.259 --> 01:23:36.327
Why don't you kill me?

01:23:38.930 --> 01:23:41.532
You train in order to better me,

01:23:42.434 --> 01:23:44.868
but not
in the mutenichi-ryu style.

01:23:48.974 --> 01:23:50.374
You are...

01:23:52.110 --> 01:23:54.545
A heretic, just like me.

01:23:55.113 --> 01:23:56.447
That's crazy!

01:23:59.851 --> 01:24:01.719
I'm not like you!

01:24:04.756 --> 01:24:06.991
Are you so very different?

01:24:18.169 --> 01:24:19.870
What's wrong?

01:24:25.210 --> 01:24:26.677
Nothing.

01:24:33.918 --> 01:24:35.686
With lord habaki?

01:24:35.954 --> 01:24:38.822
He wants to hold a banquet

01:24:39.090 --> 01:24:41.292
for all the itto-ryu
instructors.

01:24:42.961 --> 01:24:47.898
I'm afraid I've promised to go
to the ibane dojo at mt takao.

01:24:48.433 --> 01:24:50.834
Could you attend the banquet?

01:24:51.269 --> 01:24:55.105
I don't mind,
but who's going with you?

01:24:55.940 --> 01:25:01.312
Anyone after your head
could ambush you along the way.

01:25:02.314 --> 01:25:04.448
I've thought about that.

01:25:55.967 --> 01:25:57.101
What?

01:25:59.471 --> 01:26:01.071
He's itto-ryu.

01:26:10.882 --> 01:26:12.049
So...

01:26:13.451 --> 01:26:15.552
I've been smelling something.

01:26:15.554 --> 01:26:18.422
I thought it's shit stuck
to my ass.

01:26:18.556 --> 01:26:21.525
I thought I might take your head.

01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:26.196
So you're the
hundred killer, huh?

01:26:26.531 --> 01:26:30.901
Then I'll take payback
for my comrades.

01:26:45.717 --> 01:26:48.152
Not much class to that act.

01:26:52.424 --> 01:26:58.228
You've been going by my name,
and now I'm famous.

01:26:58.563 --> 01:27:02.032
So you're manji...

01:27:02.167 --> 01:27:03.700
Who are you?

01:27:04.436 --> 01:27:06.703
Shira, of the mugai-ryu.

01:27:07.906 --> 01:27:12.209
This is giichi,
and that's hyakurin.

01:27:12.977 --> 01:27:14.845
The others aren't here.

01:27:15.113 --> 01:27:17.581
If we all stay hidden,

01:27:18.049 --> 01:27:22.219
the itto-ryu won't know
they have two enemies.

01:27:23.121 --> 01:27:27.724
Would you join these reprobates
to bring down anotsu?

01:27:29.928 --> 01:27:32.496
You really are naive.

01:27:32.630 --> 01:27:34.598
So it's a deal.

01:27:35.767 --> 01:27:36.767
Here.

01:27:36.935 --> 01:27:38.135
Read this.

01:27:49.747 --> 01:27:52.015
He's going to mt takao in drag?

01:27:53.485 --> 01:27:55.152
Who wrote this?

01:27:55.587 --> 01:27:59.623
<i>We've infiltrated
someone into the itto-ryu.</i>

01:27:59.625 --> 01:28:01.692
You've got a spy.

01:28:02.093 --> 01:28:05.195
We'll split up
and watch the roads.

01:28:05.897 --> 01:28:08.031
Shira and manji,
take the koshu road.

01:28:09.267 --> 01:28:11.768
We'll take the oyama road.

01:28:15.340 --> 01:28:16.907
It's not poisoned.

01:28:34.492 --> 01:28:36.793
You have very good sake.

01:28:45.169 --> 01:28:46.136
Manji!

01:28:46.404 --> 01:28:47.838
He's here.

01:28:48.907 --> 01:28:52.543
That looks like an axe
in that carrying-cloth.

01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:56.947
Shira,

01:28:57.482 --> 01:28:59.249
are you sure?

01:28:59.251 --> 01:29:00.651
Of what?

01:29:01.152 --> 01:29:02.619
It's too good to be true.

01:29:02.787 --> 01:29:05.255
I'll go check her out.

01:29:05.490 --> 01:29:06.723
Hey...

01:29:08.326 --> 01:29:09.593
You!

01:29:20.438 --> 01:29:24.074
How could you do that?
My face is my fortune!

01:29:25.376 --> 01:29:25.676
A woman...

01:29:29.714 --> 01:29:34.318
What do you think you're doing,
playing stupid games!

01:29:43.127 --> 01:29:44.928
I get it!

01:29:45.263 --> 01:29:50.867
They got your spy to cooperate
and lure us out.

01:29:51.069 --> 01:29:53.804
Don't stand around
admiring them.

01:29:54.939 --> 01:29:58.141
<i>These nobodies
only bring three ryo.</i>

01:29:58.409 --> 01:30:01.979
The one we're after is worth 30!

01:30:42.020 --> 01:30:42.986
No!

01:30:53.631 --> 01:30:55.365
Have mercy!

01:30:56.901 --> 01:30:58.035
No.

01:31:00.438 --> 01:31:03.407
Shira! She's not itto-ryu!

01:31:03.409 --> 01:31:05.442
She's just hired!

01:31:05.444 --> 01:31:06.677
Shut up!

01:31:11.816 --> 01:31:17.721
If there's one thing I hate,
it's a kid giving me orders!

01:31:19.057 --> 01:31:22.726
Open your yap again
and I'll kill you!

01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:30.834
Hold it!

01:31:42.413 --> 01:31:44.047
You're just like...

01:31:47.085 --> 01:31:49.252
The ones I hate!

01:31:51.556 --> 01:31:53.356
Is that all?

01:31:56.094 --> 01:31:58.128
Then shut up.

01:31:59.330 --> 01:32:04.234
I'm trying to have fun.

01:32:30.128 --> 01:32:31.828
What the hell?

01:32:33.397 --> 01:32:36.967
Aw, damn! Looks like I hit you.

01:32:37.735 --> 01:32:39.102
Sorry about that.

01:32:39.804 --> 01:32:41.238
I didn't mean it.

01:32:42.673 --> 01:32:44.374
Manji...

01:32:45.376 --> 01:32:46.977
You bastard!

01:33:11.869 --> 01:33:16.406
What kind of idiot would
pick a fight with a lunatic?

01:33:18.142 --> 01:33:21.278
It's like
asking him to kill you.

01:33:23.514 --> 01:33:24.548
Yeah...

01:33:27.618 --> 01:33:30.020
I thought I was dead.

01:33:32.089 --> 01:33:35.192
- If I was like you...
- Just so you know...

01:33:36.394 --> 01:33:39.563
I didn't get like this
because I wanted to.

01:33:49.574 --> 01:33:51.074
Long ago...

01:33:53.177 --> 01:33:58.048
I killed an official on
the orders of my superior.

01:34:01.652 --> 01:34:02.919
I was told

01:34:03.487 --> 01:34:07.190
he was fattening his wallet
by oppressing the common people.

01:34:12.296 --> 01:34:13.430
But...

01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:19.169
That was a bald-faced lie.

01:34:22.673 --> 01:34:24.641
The man I killed...

01:34:26.077 --> 01:34:30.881
Was about to inform
on my superior for corruption.

01:34:34.352 --> 01:34:37.120
So I killed my superior.

01:34:38.689 --> 01:34:41.091
And his bodyguards.

01:34:43.561 --> 01:34:44.628
But...

01:34:46.831 --> 01:34:48.665
One of them...

01:34:51.502 --> 01:34:53.370
Was machi's husband.

01:34:55.373 --> 01:34:56.406
Huh?

01:35:03.848 --> 01:35:07.784
She went mad with grief.

01:35:11.989 --> 01:35:18.395
<i>I took her and ran,
killing whoever came after us.</i>

01:35:20.998 --> 01:35:25.402
Then some damn bounty hunter
killed machi.

01:35:26.737 --> 01:35:29.472
I figured then I could die, too.

01:35:32.143 --> 01:35:34.177
But that yaobikuni,
whoever she is,

01:35:34.179 --> 01:35:36.713
made me like I am now.

01:35:55.766 --> 01:35:58.435
Look at all these wounds.

01:36:02.073 --> 01:36:04.541
I can't even hold a sword right.

01:36:22.893 --> 01:36:24.027
Fourteen..

01:36:24.029 --> 01:36:25.395
Here you are.

01:36:25.397 --> 01:36:26.429
Fifteen.

01:36:27.798 --> 01:36:29.299
Thank you.

01:37:03.534 --> 01:37:05.068
What do you want?

01:37:06.904 --> 01:37:08.605
Where's shira?

01:37:11.108 --> 01:37:14.344
Our agreement is canceled.

01:37:15.646 --> 01:37:17.047
Why?

01:37:17.181 --> 01:37:21.885
You're just after the itto-ryu
for the money.

01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:28.358
<i>One point five ryo for a nobody,
30 ryo for anotsu.</i>

01:37:30.928 --> 01:37:33.329
You had really good sake

01:37:33.964 --> 01:37:35.732
and a nice place.

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.368
That's government-supplied.

01:37:39.670 --> 01:37:42.105
You're living high on the hog.

01:37:44.475 --> 01:37:49.779
It's not just for money.
We're under death sentences.

01:37:50.214 --> 01:37:53.016
We do as they say, or we die.

01:37:53.150 --> 01:37:55.518
Spare me the excuses.

01:37:56.487 --> 01:38:02.592
The shogunate is never going
to team up with the itto-ryu.

01:38:04.728 --> 01:38:07.464
They want to smash it, right?

01:38:09.366 --> 01:38:13.136
They're going to finish off
the itto-ryu by themselves.

01:38:15.239 --> 01:38:20.143
It'll all fizzle out
without rin getting revenge.

01:38:22.446 --> 01:38:26.182
So, why are you still in it?

01:38:26.184 --> 01:38:28.418
That doesn't concern you.

01:38:32.456 --> 01:38:33.756
Rin?

01:38:34.558 --> 01:38:36.292
I brought you this.

01:38:39.497 --> 01:38:41.164
At least say...

01:38:51.108 --> 01:38:52.575
<i>Dear manji...</i>

01:38:54.078 --> 01:38:56.346
<i>Forgive me
for leaving like this.</i>

01:38:58.415 --> 01:39:01.784
<i>From here on,
I will do this alone.</i>

01:39:04.155 --> 01:39:05.522
You damn fool!

01:39:05.689 --> 01:39:09.092
<i>I know I do not have
the strength</i>

01:39:09.226 --> 01:39:12.228
<i>to defeat anotsu kagehisa.</i>

01:39:13.597 --> 01:39:14.731
<i>However...</i>

01:39:14.733 --> 01:39:19.269
<i>I cannot take advantage of you
any longer.</i>

01:39:22.139 --> 01:39:26.876
<i>Isn't death
what you really want?</i>

01:39:29.113 --> 01:39:31.581
<i>Did you become my bodyguard</i>

01:39:31.749 --> 01:39:35.852
<i>in the hope
that if you fought the itto-ryu.</i>

01:39:36.020 --> 01:39:38.454
<i>One of them might kill you?</i>

01:39:41.926 --> 01:39:43.226
<i>But...</i>

01:39:44.695 --> 01:39:47.463
<i>I don't want to lose you.</i>

01:39:48.766 --> 01:39:50.633
<i>I don't want you dead.</i>

01:39:52.736 --> 01:39:54.604
<i>Realizing that...</i>

01:39:55.639 --> 01:40:00.276
<i>I have decided
I cannot be with you anymore.</i>

01:40:03.314 --> 01:40:06.816
<i>I don't know
why you have been made immortal.</i>

01:40:07.351 --> 01:40:11.821
<i>But because of that,
I have been saved.</i>

01:40:13.457 --> 01:40:17.126
<i>There are those, like me,</i>

01:40:17.628 --> 01:40:21.264
<i>who weep
at their own helplessness...</i>

01:40:22.533 --> 01:40:26.669
<i>Or who have lost
those they loved.</i>

01:40:29.106 --> 01:40:35.545
<i>Use your immortality
to stand with them.</i>

01:40:38.616 --> 01:40:39.849
<i>Manji...</i>

01:40:41.885 --> 01:40:43.820
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:40:46.557 --> 01:40:47.890
<i>Goodbye.</i>

01:41:02.906 --> 01:41:04.807
<i>How do you do?</i>
803/
01:41:05,709 --> 01:41:10,546
I am anotsu kagehisa,
head of the itto-ryu.

01:41:20.658 --> 01:41:24.961
Ibane kensui,
head of the shinkeito-ryu.

01:41:25.629 --> 01:41:29.732
I gladly accept your request...

01:41:32.002 --> 01:41:33.803
To join us.

01:41:42.079 --> 01:41:43.813
I'm very sorry...

01:41:47.618 --> 01:41:50.520
But please forget that request.

01:41:54.758 --> 01:41:57.660
- I am truly sorry.
- Why?

01:42:02.966 --> 01:42:04.801
Won't you tell me?

01:42:26.590 --> 01:42:29.592
You got too proud,
anotsu kagehisa!

01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:34.731
You are declared a public enemy.
Your itto-ryu ends here!

01:42:36.867 --> 01:42:38.568
You tricked me...

01:42:40.671 --> 01:42:42.705
Lord habaki!

01:43:12.069 --> 01:43:14.270
Do you suppose

01:43:14.272 --> 01:43:16.572
master anotsu
has arrived at takao?

01:43:17.241 --> 01:43:23.913
He should be exchanging toasts
with master ibane by now.

01:43:25.816 --> 01:43:31.587
His spirit and energy
are truly awe-inspiring.

01:43:51.041 --> 01:43:52.742
Manji!

01:43:53.110 --> 01:43:54.944
Now I know...

01:43:55.712 --> 01:44:01.617
How to make you pay
for my hand and my hair!

01:44:25.075 --> 01:44:28.044
Habaki! Damn you!

01:44:39.923 --> 01:44:41.691
Anotsu kagehisa!

01:44:45.729 --> 01:44:48.631
I don't have time for you now.

01:44:48.932 --> 01:44:50.500
Then draw and fight!

01:44:50.634 --> 01:44:53.102
Run, or you'll get mixed up in this.

01:44:53.670 --> 01:44:55.538
- Huh?
- There he is!

01:44:56.507 --> 01:44:59.242
The itto-ryu has been outlawed.

01:45:08.218 --> 01:45:09.252
Hold it!

01:45:39.383 --> 01:45:41.050
Are you itto-ryu?

01:45:43.020 --> 01:45:43.986
Two?

01:45:48.625 --> 01:45:50.860
We thought
you might come this way.

01:45:51.028 --> 01:45:55.631
I'm in a hurry.
Get out of my way.

01:46:01.371 --> 01:46:02.338
Hey...

01:46:03.507 --> 01:46:06.909
Don't you guys believe
in fighting one on one?

01:46:07.044 --> 01:46:08.311
Smart-ass!

01:46:19.456 --> 01:46:20.923
Kill him!

01:46:21.058 --> 01:46:22.658
Don't give me orders.

01:46:33.136 --> 01:46:34.670
Bastards!

01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:39.942
You're nobodies right to the
marrow of your bones.

01:46:40.444 --> 01:46:41.944
Thanks for that.

01:46:43.948 --> 01:46:45.114
Damn you!

01:47:22.753 --> 01:47:25.254
Come on, you damn worms!

01:47:26.123 --> 01:47:27.723
Get to work!

01:47:28.458 --> 01:47:29.725
Come on!

01:47:46.076 --> 01:47:47.410
Manji...

01:47:48.545 --> 01:47:50.846
Why do you fight to live?

01:47:57.954 --> 01:48:04.994
Do nothing,
and your wish will be granted.

01:48:06.730 --> 01:48:10.700
You can end your immortal life.

01:48:10.702 --> 01:48:13.903
Shut up, you old cow!
Get out of here!

01:48:14.938 --> 01:48:16.272
So,

01:48:16.673 --> 01:48:21.477
that girl's life
is more important, is it?

01:48:24.448 --> 01:48:26.682
You poor man!

01:48:27.150 --> 01:48:29.852
You can't let go
of your humanity,

01:48:29.854 --> 01:48:33.289
and must wander in infinity...

01:48:33.291 --> 01:48:35.458
Shut up, I said!

01:48:37.594 --> 01:48:38.961
Come on!

01:48:57.314 --> 01:48:59.048
That was close.

01:49:02.886 --> 01:49:04.754
Wait for me, rin.

01:49:23.473 --> 01:49:28.077
Damn this thing!

01:50:00.544 --> 01:50:03.145
The itto-ryu is destroyed.

01:50:05.115 --> 01:50:10.152
If you are their leader,
choose a death that befits you!

01:50:12.823 --> 01:50:16.125
My comrades may all be dead...

01:50:17.994 --> 01:50:21.297
But my ambition
is alive and well!

01:50:36.513 --> 01:50:37.580
Wait!

01:50:42.853 --> 01:50:45.521
You call yourselves samurai?

01:50:46.156 --> 01:50:50.459
He's only one man.
And there's all of you!

01:50:53.730 --> 01:50:56.999
Even killing
should be done right!

01:50:58.935 --> 01:51:01.937
And you, too, anotsu!

01:51:03.139 --> 01:51:06.141
As if you can do
everything alone!

01:51:07.644 --> 01:51:09.478
Who do you think you are?

01:51:16.853 --> 01:51:18.454
That girl...

01:51:18.622 --> 01:51:20.122
Silence her.

01:51:42.512 --> 01:51:43.913
Manji!

01:51:56.226 --> 01:51:57.493
Out of the way.

01:52:09.072 --> 01:52:11.740
You get everything wrong,

01:52:12.475 --> 01:52:16.111
then you run off worried
about your bodyguard.

01:52:17.447 --> 01:52:18.981
I'm not dying...

01:52:21.451 --> 01:52:23.652
Till you get revenge.

01:52:27.891 --> 01:52:29.258
Rin...

01:52:30.327 --> 01:52:33.729
Is that anotsu kagehisa
standing behind you?

01:52:38.068 --> 01:52:41.437
Why protect the guy
you want revenge on?

01:52:45.075 --> 01:52:48.143
I'm not protecting him!
It's just that...

01:52:48.278 --> 01:52:52.047
You're a pain in the ass.
So who do I kill, then?

01:53:07.731 --> 01:53:09.231
Whoever...

01:53:11.735 --> 01:53:14.003
Is trying to kill me.

01:53:24.381 --> 01:53:25.781
Fine with me.

01:53:26.916 --> 01:53:31.653
Itto-ryu or government,
I couldn't care less.

01:53:32.589 --> 01:53:35.357
Anyone who goes after you.

01:53:35.892 --> 01:53:36.959
Kill them!

01:53:37.127 --> 01:53:39.561
Him and the girl!

01:53:55.879 --> 01:53:57.179
Rin!

01:56:01.371 --> 01:56:02.371
Manji!

01:56:17.587 --> 01:56:18.654
Run!

01:58:25.982 --> 01:58:27.316
Makie.

01:58:53.142 --> 01:58:55.577
Do you want to fight or not?

01:59:08.191 --> 01:59:09.391
Manji!

01:59:16.332 --> 01:59:17.532
Ow!

01:59:19.569 --> 01:59:21.770
You're still lousy at that!

01:59:22.705 --> 01:59:23.672
Sorry!

01:59:43.192 --> 01:59:44.693
Upstairs!

02:00:09.719 --> 02:00:10.786
Rin!

02:00:28.304 --> 02:00:29.671
Stay by me!

02:00:40.917 --> 02:00:42.818
Shira!

02:00:45.621 --> 02:00:47.889
Can't you even die right?

02:01:04.707 --> 02:01:05.841
Rin!

02:01:13.349 --> 02:01:15.116
You bastard!

02:01:21.657 --> 02:01:23.592
Move!

02:01:43.813 --> 02:01:45.881
Out of the way!

02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:51.753
Rin!

02:02:18.881 --> 02:02:20.248
Gunpowder...

02:03:15.471 --> 02:03:21.376
Anotsu kagehisa, you poor fool.

02:03:22.545 --> 02:03:25.180
Did you think the shogun

02:03:25.615 --> 02:03:28.316
would let a man like you
instruct his warriors?

02:03:50.406 --> 02:03:51.473
Shira!

02:03:51.475 --> 02:03:52.741
Hey!

02:03:53.609 --> 02:03:55.377
Stop right there.

02:04:09.158 --> 02:04:11.092
You gave me

02:04:15.297 --> 02:04:17.866
a great idea.

02:04:22.471 --> 02:04:23.772
Don't!

02:04:32.314 --> 02:04:34.182
Drop your weapons.

02:04:36.218 --> 02:04:37.719
<i>Manji...</i>

02:04:38.554 --> 02:04:41.022
Drop your swords.

02:04:44.360 --> 02:04:46.194
Not again.

02:05:01.510 --> 02:05:03.878
All of them.

02:05:11.587 --> 02:05:13.088
Drop 'em.

02:05:21.431 --> 02:05:22.697
Idiot!

02:05:23.032 --> 02:05:26.801
Now watch while this kid dies.

02:05:33.209 --> 02:05:35.910
Missed me.

02:05:36.545 --> 02:05:38.780
You'll be sorry!

02:05:43.385 --> 02:05:45.220
Manji!

02:05:52.695 --> 02:05:54.095
Hey...

02:05:58.134 --> 02:05:59.200
Come on.

02:06:07.409 --> 02:06:08.543
Shira...

02:06:09.779 --> 02:06:14.048
I can still kill you unarmed.

02:06:38.474 --> 02:06:40.041
Shira...

02:06:41.076 --> 02:06:42.410
You lose.

02:06:42.578 --> 02:06:44.045
Screw that.

02:06:45.614 --> 02:06:47.649
Even if I fall...

02:06:48.651 --> 02:06:54.522
I swear I'll crawl back up
and take your head someday!

02:06:58.828 --> 02:07:00.895
So you wait!

02:07:01.597 --> 02:07:03.464
Come on! Do it!

02:07:55.851 --> 02:07:57.385
Hundred killer...

02:07:58.921 --> 02:08:01.589
Thanks to you, I'm still alive.

02:08:09.832 --> 02:08:12.467
Thank her, too.

02:08:31.287 --> 02:08:32.687
I leave.

02:08:40.830 --> 02:08:43.464
Spoken like a true villain.

02:08:45.567 --> 02:08:47.335
But you know...

02:08:53.842 --> 02:08:57.211
I never want to see you
walk away again...

02:08:58.981 --> 02:09:00.648
Anotsu kagehisa.

02:09:12.995 --> 02:09:14.495
I see.

02:09:17.533 --> 02:09:19.634
So I should kill you now...

02:09:23.138 --> 02:09:25.673
And avoid trouble later?

02:09:36.986 --> 02:09:39.020
Keep back, rin.

02:13:14.836 --> 02:13:16.404
Hear me.

02:13:18.473 --> 02:13:24.278
Whether it takes years,
or decades...

02:13:27.216 --> 02:13:34.388
And whether it's from me
or my children when I'm dead...

02:13:35.924 --> 02:13:38.893
Fear of the warrior's sword...

02:13:39.995 --> 02:13:41.996
Will revive in this land.

02:13:58.080 --> 02:13:59.480
Anotsu kagehisa!

02:14:15.130 --> 02:14:16.464
Manji!

02:14:18.934 --> 02:14:20.034
Rin...

02:14:34.983 --> 02:14:39.954
Hundred killer, I'll be waiting.

02:14:42.858 --> 02:14:44.959
Don't be long.

02:14:46.128 --> 02:14:47.828
Sorry...

02:14:49.398 --> 02:14:56.570
But I can't go before she does.

02:15:34.209 --> 02:15:35.509
Manji?

02:15:37.813 --> 02:15:39.013
Manji!

02:15:39.948 --> 02:15:41.582
Manji!

02:15:42.751 --> 02:15:44.452
Manji!

02:16:11.046 --> 02:16:13.114
You lied to me!

02:16:13.415 --> 02:16:16.083
You said you wouldn't die!

02:16:17.119 --> 02:16:20.154
You wouldn't die before me!

02:16:23.125 --> 02:16:24.692
You liar!

02:16:37.004 --> 02:16:40.941
Forgive me, brother.

02:16:47.582 --> 02:16:51.919
That's 'big brother', stupid!
