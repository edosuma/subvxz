WEBVTT

00:30.245 --> 00:32.311
I don't know if you can hear me.

00:35.150 --> 00:38.451
I got to admit,
you freaked me out before.

00:38.453 --> 00:41.354
I didn't understand you, but...

00:41.356 --> 00:43.723
I get it now.

00:46.027 --> 00:48.294
Come on, man, talk to me.

00:48.296 --> 00:51.364
I know everything about you.

00:51.366 --> 00:53.966
I'm a fan.

00:53.968 --> 00:55.301
Your name

00:55.303 --> 00:57.870
is James Patrick March.

00:57.872 --> 01:01.407
You were born October 30, 1895.

01:02.610 --> 01:04.277
You're a Scorpio,

01:04.279 --> 01:07.847
which explains a lot.

01:09.551 --> 01:12.452
You're the greatest
serial killer who's ever lived.

01:16.658 --> 01:19.392
How do you know all this?

01:20.362 --> 01:22.295
I Googled you.

01:22.297 --> 01:24.564
That sounds obscene.

01:24.566 --> 01:26.466
You were right, man.

01:26.468 --> 01:28.034
Killing

01:28.036 --> 01:29.902
is awesome.

01:36.244 --> 01:38.411
High-five!

01:38.413 --> 01:41.013
Good. You've found your calling.

01:41.015 --> 01:43.483
Then you can appreciate
what I've built here.

01:43.485 --> 01:45.518
Secret rooms, hinged walls,

01:45.520 --> 01:48.921
acid pits, asphyxiation chambers.

01:48.923 --> 01:52.425
Are you familiar with my Black Closet?

02:07.842 --> 02:10.509
Yes.

02:13.348 --> 02:14.847
There are places in my murder palace

02:14.849 --> 02:18.117
that have sat in cold neglect
for far too long.

02:20.522 --> 02:22.455
You can put them to good use, old boy.

02:22.457 --> 02:23.523
I'm listening.

02:23.525 --> 02:26.692
Good.

02:26.694 --> 02:28.961
- Now...
- My God, look at this.

02:31.533 --> 02:33.065
The whole floor needs to be torn out.

02:33.067 --> 02:35.535
This space is perfect for my atelier.

02:35.537 --> 02:37.370
It's gonna be sensational.

02:37.372 --> 02:38.838
And wait until you see this room.

02:40.475 --> 02:42.408
What are you doing here?

02:42.410 --> 02:44.877
Visiting a friend.

02:44.879 --> 02:47.647
I was told that nobody lives
on this floor.

02:47.649 --> 02:50.149
You're a squatter.

02:50.151 --> 02:51.584
Tristan, you clean up pretty well.

02:51.586 --> 02:53.319
I barely recognized you.

02:53.321 --> 02:54.520
Thank you, Claudia.

03:00.495 --> 03:03.062
What happened to your cut?

03:06.768 --> 03:08.134
Get your paws off.

03:08.136 --> 03:09.435
I'm not here to be a deposit

03:09.437 --> 03:10.570
in your spank bank.

03:12.340 --> 03:13.473
Owned, Dad.

03:15.143 --> 03:16.809
Get out.

03:16.811 --> 03:19.812
I'll call the cops if I
see you in my hotel again.

03:21.916 --> 03:23.850
Models.

03:27.422 --> 03:28.988
Tear this floor out?

03:28.990 --> 03:31.524
Where will I launder the linens?

03:31.526 --> 03:34.594
He can't be allowed
to touch a single room.

03:34.596 --> 03:37.196
Don't worry, dude.

03:38.132 --> 03:41.200
I got this.

04:41.000 --> 04:45.000
# American Horror Story 5x03 #
Mommy
Original Air Date on October 21, 2015

04:52.507 --> 04:54.707
It's hard to believe now,

04:54.709 --> 04:57.076
but raising kids was never
a part of my hopes and dreams.

04:57.078 --> 05:00.846
My friends with babies
only made me more resistant.

05:00.848 --> 05:02.548
Their lives seemed

05:02.550 --> 05:04.550
kind of dreary, to be honest.

05:04.552 --> 05:07.620
I wanted to save kids,
other people's kids.

05:07.622 --> 05:10.590
If I'm honest?

05:10.592 --> 05:12.892
Being the best pediatrician possible

05:12.894 --> 05:15.628
was my only real dream.

05:19.100 --> 05:21.367
Okay.

05:21.369 --> 05:23.269
We're going to get you to the hospital

05:23.271 --> 05:25.571
and put you on a big fat IV

05:25.573 --> 05:27.473
of antibiotics.

05:27.475 --> 05:28.541
Okay?

05:28.543 --> 05:30.710
We just need his slippers and his coat.

05:30.712 --> 05:31.811
Wait, wait, wait, hospital?

05:31.813 --> 05:33.746
This kind of pneumonia,

05:33.748 --> 05:36.649
the one we associate with,
the measles, is something

05:36.651 --> 05:37.717
we like to treat,

05:37.719 --> 05:40.653
aggressively.

05:40.655 --> 05:42.622
I don't understand why
you didn't you call me

05:42.624 --> 05:44.724
the second his fever went over a 103.

05:44.726 --> 05:46.959
I... I guess I felt ashamed
after our last conversation.

05:46.961 --> 05:49.328
You made me feel pretty terrible.

05:51.065 --> 05:53.966
Please just tell me
he's gonna be all right.

05:53.968 --> 05:56.902
I hope so. Upstairs.

06:02.176 --> 06:06.412
By the way, I'm not unaware
of the obvious cliché here--

06:06.414 --> 06:09.949
I wanted to save kids
because I felt I needed saving.

06:09.951 --> 06:13.319
But in my case the cliché is dead on.

06:13.321 --> 06:15.855
Suffice it to say,
mine was not a happy childhood.

06:30.705 --> 06:32.772
Then Holden showed up.

06:34.809 --> 06:36.709
It was a tectonic shift

06:36.711 --> 06:39.712
where everything I thought
I knew about myself

06:39.714 --> 06:41.714
got rearranged.

06:41.716 --> 06:45.451
It was like I finally
fell in love for real.

06:45.453 --> 06:49.155
All the cracks and
missing pieces came together.

06:49.157 --> 06:51.557
I felt whole.

06:51.559 --> 06:53.859
I'd found my soul mate.

06:58.232 --> 07:00.800
I couldn't stop smelling his head.

07:00.802 --> 07:03.836
It made me feel drowsy and giddy,

07:03.838 --> 07:05.971
like we were in the middle
of a lavender field

07:05.973 --> 07:08.174
in the south of France.

07:08.176 --> 07:09.842
The smell was real.

07:09.844 --> 07:12.244
He truly smelled like fresh lavender.

07:12.246 --> 07:14.980
It was and always will be
my drug of choice.

07:17.752 --> 07:20.820
I even wondered if I truly loved John,

07:20.822 --> 07:22.855
because my feelings for him

07:22.857 --> 07:25.257
were never as powerful
as my feelings for Holden.

07:25.259 --> 07:27.493
And I've always felt guilty

07:27.495 --> 07:30.196
because I never quite bonded
like that with Scarlett

07:30.198 --> 07:32.164
when she was a baby.

07:32.166 --> 07:34.500
It was a special kind of love.

07:34.502 --> 07:37.303
Maybe a once in a lifetime thing.

07:38.940 --> 07:40.740
And then he disappeared.

07:40.742 --> 07:42.007
Holden!

07:42.009 --> 07:44.176
Holden?

07:44.178 --> 07:46.245
Holden!

07:46.247 --> 07:48.280
Holden!

07:54.522 --> 07:57.757
At first, every time you hear the phone,

07:57.759 --> 08:00.059
you think they've found him.

08:01.796 --> 08:04.697
Your heart pounds.

08:04.699 --> 08:06.699
Hello?

08:06.701 --> 08:09.802
Then after a month or so,

08:09.804 --> 08:12.872
the phone is just the phone.

08:12.874 --> 08:14.540
You do whatever

08:14.542 --> 08:16.709
you need to do to soldier on,

08:16.711 --> 08:19.111
because, you tell yourself,

08:19.113 --> 08:21.213
time is on your side.

08:23.718 --> 08:26.719
And then a year has gone by,
and you understand

08:26.721 --> 08:30.456
that the next year
will not be much different.

08:30.458 --> 08:32.558
This feeling will never go away...

08:33.995 --> 08:35.828
...'cause there is no getting over it,

08:35.830 --> 08:37.696
there is no getting to the other side.

08:52.346 --> 08:54.747
I do carry on.

08:54.749 --> 08:57.583
Mostly for Scarlett.

08:57.585 --> 09:00.820
But there are many days
when I don't really know why.

09:00.822 --> 09:03.923
Some days are bearable.

09:03.925 --> 09:06.492
Today is very hard.

09:06.494 --> 09:08.861
Alex?

09:08.863 --> 09:10.663
You with us?

09:10.665 --> 09:13.399
We haven't heard a lot from you, Alex.

09:17.038 --> 09:20.773
I don't know what to say.

09:20.775 --> 09:22.808
I'm afraid the truth

09:22.810 --> 09:25.945
about how I'm feeling
wouldn't be very helpful.

09:25.947 --> 09:29.048
This is the right place
for you to speak your truth.

09:29.050 --> 09:31.951
And the right time.

09:32.887 --> 09:35.855
Honestly, I'm angry.

09:36.991 --> 09:39.792
I mean, I don't understand, Scarlett.

09:41.996 --> 09:45.865
It's like you're trying to hurt me.

09:47.969 --> 09:50.569
Us.

09:50.571 --> 09:54.139
I don't have the sense that
Scarlett holds any ill will.

09:54.141 --> 09:56.542
Her stories strike me as being

09:56.544 --> 09:58.577
more about wanting to
alleviate your pain,

09:58.579 --> 10:01.013
wanting the family whole again.

10:01.015 --> 10:02.181
You're both wrong.

10:02.183 --> 10:04.216
It's not about my mother or the family.

10:04.218 --> 10:06.318
It's what happened.

10:06.320 --> 10:10.089
Scarlett, tell us the story

10:10.091 --> 10:12.024
exactly how you remember it.

10:12.026 --> 10:12.958
Tell us everything.

10:19.233 --> 10:22.368
Well, there's a room where
they all play Nintendo

10:22.370 --> 10:25.571
and there are these big glass
things full of jelly beans.

10:25.573 --> 10:27.840
That sounds like a fun place.

10:27.842 --> 10:30.009
And he sleeps in the bottom

10:30.011 --> 10:32.011
of a glass coffin

10:32.013 --> 10:34.880
in the bottom of an empty swimming pool.

10:34.882 --> 10:36.882
That's when I first saw him.

10:36.884 --> 10:38.884
He was just waking up.

10:38.886 --> 10:42.788
And when you first saw him...

10:42.790 --> 10:44.924
and what did he say exactly?

10:44.926 --> 10:46.558
Does he talk about us?

10:46.560 --> 10:47.927
No, he was different.

10:47.929 --> 10:51.764
He didn't have normal feelings.

10:51.766 --> 10:53.966
And he smelled like

10:53.968 --> 10:55.901
lavender.

10:55.903 --> 10:57.903
You know,

10:57.905 --> 10:59.705
like those candles we have at home.

11:01.876 --> 11:03.876
Yes, dear.

11:03.878 --> 11:06.145
Yes, the change of scenery
was good for Will.

11:06.147 --> 11:08.047
He was getting too stale in New York.

11:08.049 --> 11:09.281
Yes, Jess.

11:09.283 --> 11:10.983
I'm losing you.

11:10.985 --> 11:12.785
Can you hear me?

11:12.787 --> 11:14.386
Claudia, Claudia... Yes.

11:14.388 --> 11:16.288
We need to get Mario Testino
out here to do a shoot.

11:16.290 --> 11:18.924
Did you hear that? Jess?

11:18.926 --> 11:20.526
Darn.

12:12.113 --> 12:13.879
No!

12:17.685 --> 12:19.218
No! No!

12:22.857 --> 12:24.656
Help me! No!

12:45.146 --> 12:47.980
I got the guys checking
on Islamic terrorist groups

12:47.982 --> 12:50.516
active in the area.

12:50.518 --> 12:53.185
You know, this could be another

12:53.187 --> 12:55.788
Charlie Hebdo thing.

13:00.061 --> 13:02.628
This is a gossip site.

13:23.717 --> 13:26.652
He stopped their tongues from wagging.

13:28.222 --> 13:31.690
Thou shalt not bear false witness.

13:40.434 --> 13:43.869
These people trafficked in lies.

13:43.871 --> 13:46.205
They broke the commandment.

13:48.209 --> 13:50.209
Have ballistics run a check
on the casings at the scene

13:50.211 --> 13:52.211
with casings from previous murders.

13:52.213 --> 13:53.378
All of the cases?

13:53.380 --> 13:54.813
Yeah, all of them.

13:54.815 --> 13:56.048
Gotcha.

13:56.050 --> 13:57.616
There may be a previous
commandment murder

13:57.618 --> 13:59.051
that we missed. We'll cross-reference.

13:59.053 --> 14:00.319
I'm not sure, but I think...

14:01.455 --> 14:04.156
Help me.

14:04.158 --> 14:05.424
Help me.

14:26.480 --> 14:28.280
Boo!

14:29.250 --> 14:31.483
How the hell did you get in here?

14:31.485 --> 14:33.785
I picked the lock.

14:33.787 --> 14:35.621
When I was first starting out modeling,

14:35.623 --> 14:38.624
I made extra scratch as a thief.

14:38.626 --> 14:41.093
I'm not the waiting tables type.

14:41.095 --> 14:43.295
I did six months for
breaking and entering.

14:43.297 --> 14:45.364
Did you know that?

14:45.366 --> 14:47.833
Look, I'm sorry about the show.

14:47.835 --> 14:51.503
I'm clean now, I swear.

14:51.505 --> 14:55.374
You and I used to get along
great when I was clean.

14:55.376 --> 14:57.743
You thought I was hilarious.

15:00.814 --> 15:02.447
Every beautiful young thing

15:02.449 --> 15:04.516
is hilarious.

15:04.518 --> 15:07.119
And then you get old
and you don't understand

15:07.121 --> 15:11.390
why everyone isn't still
laughing at your jokes.

15:12.893 --> 15:16.361
How did they fix that scar?

15:17.831 --> 15:20.332
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.

15:28.976 --> 15:30.342
What are those?

15:30.344 --> 15:33.245
They're the original plans
for the hotel.

15:33.247 --> 15:35.314
Well, they're the ones that
are registered with the city,

15:35.316 --> 15:36.915
but they're not
the plans for this hotel.

15:36.917 --> 15:38.550
How do you know?

15:43.190 --> 15:45.691
Well, for one thing,
there's that hallway on three

15:45.693 --> 15:48.360
with no doors that goes nowhere.

15:48.362 --> 15:50.929
And,

15:50.931 --> 15:53.165
according to these plans,

15:53.167 --> 15:55.701
there's rooms off of them
and access to the stairwell.

15:55.703 --> 15:57.202
So I think somebody
submitted these plans

15:57.204 --> 15:58.737
to get through inspection,

15:58.739 --> 16:01.106
but then just built how they wanted to.

16:01.108 --> 16:02.874
Man, you smell good.

16:02.876 --> 16:05.110
You know that's actually the worst part

16:05.112 --> 16:06.678
about being in jail?

16:06.680 --> 16:07.913
It's not the food

16:07.915 --> 16:10.682
or being locked up like a dog.

16:10.684 --> 16:12.951
It's the smell.

16:12.953 --> 16:16.755
Everyone smells like shit.

16:16.757 --> 16:20.926
Doesn't stop you from doing
stuff, though, you know?

16:20.928 --> 16:24.096
Man has needs, right?

16:26.267 --> 16:27.299
What is this?

16:27.301 --> 16:28.967
What is happening?

16:28.969 --> 16:31.436
What are you doing?

16:55.629 --> 16:57.629
Stay.

16:57.631 --> 16:59.331
Stay...

17:02.503 --> 17:05.270
Another time.

17:05.271 --> 17:08.240
What...

17:10.944 --> 17:12.611
Looking at an O.D. here?

17:12.613 --> 17:14.246
You'd think so,

17:14.248 --> 17:15.814
but everything's telling me withdrawals.

17:15.816 --> 17:16.948
I don't think this man's had

17:16.950 --> 17:18.083
a needle in him in a few days.

17:18.085 --> 17:19.084
At least.

17:19.086 --> 17:20.519
The blood? Not his.

17:22.323 --> 17:23.655
Let's get him sedated.

17:23.656 --> 17:25.190
No! Please! I'm sorry!

17:25.192 --> 17:27.626
I didn't mean it! Wait! Wait! Wait!

17:27.627 --> 17:29.795
Please. I'm sorry.
Wait, why are you sorry?

17:29.797 --> 17:32.030
Detective. I didn't mean to kill her.

17:32.032 --> 17:33.165
Wait, wait, who-who did you kill?

17:33.167 --> 17:34.466
I thought it was the other one.

17:34.468 --> 17:36.835
The junkie whore. Sally? Sally?

17:36.837 --> 17:38.670
She did this to me.

17:38.672 --> 17:39.871
She lied to me.

17:39.873 --> 17:41.306
She said that I'd be free.

17:41.308 --> 17:42.607
Okay, got to go.

17:42.609 --> 17:44.209
Got to go!

17:46.447 --> 17:48.213
We're losing him.

18:23.350 --> 18:24.916
I hear she checked out.

18:28.522 --> 18:30.222
Who did?

18:30.224 --> 18:32.891
That shit-don't-stink fashion editor.

18:32.893 --> 18:36.495
Guess this place wasn't up
to her standards.

18:36.497 --> 18:38.497
Not everyone can appreciate it here.

18:38.499 --> 18:42.067
All this lovely darkness.

18:42.069 --> 18:44.603
You know what I mean.

18:44.605 --> 18:46.071
No.

18:46.073 --> 18:47.706
I really don't.

18:47.708 --> 18:49.741
Why don't you tell me about your friend?

18:49.743 --> 18:51.042
Which one?

18:51.044 --> 18:52.344
The one at St. Vincent's.

18:52.346 --> 18:54.179
Junkie, covered in blood, not his.

18:54.181 --> 18:56.281
Well, junkies.

18:56.283 --> 18:58.683
You can't believe a word they say.

19:03.457 --> 19:06.191
Who was he?

19:07.728 --> 19:10.695
How the hell should I know?

19:14.301 --> 19:18.136
Why are you wasting
your time on junkies?

19:18.138 --> 19:20.939
We only hurt ourselves.

19:24.311 --> 19:27.512
It's not like breaking
one of the Ten Commandments.

19:28.782 --> 19:30.382
What did you say?

19:30.384 --> 19:33.285
What?

19:33.287 --> 19:35.954
Didn't you go to Sunday school?

19:35.956 --> 19:37.589
How about "Thou shalt not kill"?

19:39.560 --> 19:41.993
Well, that commandment
is always translated wrong.

19:41.995 --> 19:44.996
It should be
"Thou shalt not commit murder."

19:44.998 --> 19:48.333
Killing can be a righteous act.

19:50.404 --> 19:52.237
You've been in my room.

19:52.239 --> 19:54.673
No.

19:54.675 --> 19:57.175
But if that's an invitation...

19:57.177 --> 19:59.511
How about this for an invitation?

19:59.513 --> 20:03.148
You're under arrest.

20:03.150 --> 20:06.351
Goody.

20:09.823 --> 20:11.957
I know you sent me that text.

20:11.959 --> 20:13.925
I don't know how deeply you're involved,

20:13.927 --> 20:15.627
or if you're working with someone,

20:15.629 --> 20:17.963
or maybe just starved for attention.

20:17.965 --> 20:21.466
I am starving.

20:21.468 --> 20:24.536
You're starving, too.

20:24.538 --> 20:27.105
I can taste it on you.

20:38.385 --> 20:41.653
Come on, Detective,

20:41.655 --> 20:44.856
show me right from wrong.

20:57.571 --> 21:00.272
Let me help you.

21:02.309 --> 21:04.609
I wish you could.

21:17.524 --> 21:18.990
You'll see.

21:18.992 --> 21:21.059
You and I...

21:21.061 --> 21:23.562
we're meant to be.

21:36.843 --> 21:39.678
Dono.

21:39.680 --> 21:41.746
I've been waiting for you.

21:43.250 --> 21:46.051
Look, you need any, help packing?

21:46.053 --> 21:48.853
I, um, I printed out some Craigslist ads

21:48.855 --> 21:49.888
for apartments for us.

21:49.890 --> 21:51.690
Some nice two-bedrooms.

21:51.692 --> 21:54.225
And this one... this is...

21:54.227 --> 21:56.628
Get this, this is the
building in Santa Monica

21:56.630 --> 21:58.630
where they captured Whitey Bulger.

21:58.632 --> 22:00.565
Just look at it-- it's glamorous, right?

22:00.567 --> 22:04.536
I will live with the addicts
in shitter's alley

22:04.538 --> 22:07.072
in a box in MacArthur Park,

22:07.074 --> 22:10.575
covered in the piss and shit
of this horror of a city

22:10.577 --> 22:12.377
before I even consider

22:12.379 --> 22:14.145
living under the same roof as you again.

22:14.147 --> 22:17.749
You're a drama queen.

22:17.751 --> 22:19.050
Baby, this is our chance.

22:19.052 --> 22:21.653
This is what we've been waiting for.

22:21.655 --> 22:22.654
Listen...

22:22.656 --> 22:24.656
Don't touch me.

22:24.658 --> 22:26.124
She never loved you.

22:26.126 --> 22:27.659
She was just using you.

22:27.661 --> 22:29.928
I knew that cold snake would get bored.

22:29.930 --> 22:31.463
Not because of you.

22:31.465 --> 22:33.264
You know, because that's
just how snakes are.

22:35.068 --> 22:38.470
You really have no idea how
much I hate you, do you?

22:38.472 --> 22:41.506
And I get that you never wanted to take

22:41.508 --> 22:44.075
any authentic interest
in me or my needs,

22:44.077 --> 22:46.611
but I have worked so hard
over the past few years

22:46.613 --> 22:48.680
to get you to notice
how much I despise you.

22:49.650 --> 22:50.649
Now, you hold on a minute.

22:50.651 --> 22:52.684
I gave my life to you.

22:52.686 --> 22:56.755
You have no clue how hard
it was for me to raise you

22:56.757 --> 22:58.657
and the sacrifices that I made.
Name one,

22:58.659 --> 23:01.793
one that didn't serve your
perverted view of yourself.

23:01.795 --> 23:02.661
Your father.

23:05.532 --> 23:07.532
You think it was an easy
choice, kicking him out?

23:07.534 --> 23:10.168
Becoming a single mother at that time?

23:10.170 --> 23:12.804
Nobody did that, but I did,

23:12.806 --> 23:15.373
because he was nowhere near
man enough to raise you.

23:15.375 --> 23:17.442
My father was the best thing in my life.

23:17.444 --> 23:19.711
I once hid out
in the trunk of his Buick,

23:19.713 --> 23:21.212
and he made it all the way
to Bakersfield

23:21.214 --> 23:22.947
before he noticed and took me back home.

23:24.317 --> 23:25.984
Imagine that.

23:25.986 --> 23:29.354
He didn't even know his own son
was in the trunk of his car.

23:29.356 --> 23:31.456
The guy was an asshole; he was a moron.

23:31.458 --> 23:33.658
Do you know, when you kicked him out,

23:33.660 --> 23:35.660
he sat me down and asked me to promise

23:35.662 --> 23:38.329
that when I was old enough
I would run away?

23:39.332 --> 23:40.799
I had a plan.

23:40.801 --> 23:41.866
She had a plan.

23:46.339 --> 23:48.339
I went to an AA meeting once,

23:48.341 --> 23:50.341
and after I stood up
and shared about you,

23:50.343 --> 23:53.344
people came up to me, hardcore addicts,

23:53.346 --> 23:57.682
and they were like,
"Wow, man, no wonder you use."

23:57.684 --> 23:59.751
Every choice you made

23:59.753 --> 24:01.986
was a disaster.

24:01.988 --> 24:03.688
Dad...

24:03.690 --> 24:06.391
that insane vegetarian cult.

24:06.393 --> 24:08.426
The "Breatharaians" were cutting-edge.

24:08.428 --> 24:10.228
They were using food as medicine.

24:10.230 --> 24:13.665
I had so much fiber in my diet,
I shit my pants at school.

24:13.667 --> 24:16.668
Fine, you make a list

24:16.670 --> 24:19.437
of all the ways I have failed you.

24:19.439 --> 24:20.872
And you know what I say to your list?

24:20.874 --> 24:22.874
Shit on it.

24:22.876 --> 24:25.677
Because my list beats yours.

24:25.679 --> 24:29.714
Item one, I gave you life.

24:29.716 --> 24:32.784
Item two, I saved your life.

24:32.786 --> 24:34.619
I wanted to die!

24:34.621 --> 24:37.622
Coke, crack, heroin--
none of them could do it,

24:37.624 --> 24:39.958
so I decided death was my
only way away from you.

24:39.960 --> 24:41.292
I chose it.

24:41.294 --> 24:44.295
You hated me like that?

24:44.297 --> 24:47.098
And you let me stay here
looking after you?

24:47.100 --> 24:51.903
A real mother would have
let her son die in peace.

24:51.905 --> 24:54.205
She would have buried me.

24:54.207 --> 24:55.707
And grieved.

24:55.709 --> 25:01.112
What mother wouldn't have
wanted her son to live?

25:01.114 --> 25:05.216
Wouldn't have done everything
possible to save him?

25:05.218 --> 25:07.719
You didn't bring me back for me.

25:07.721 --> 25:10.522
You brought me back for you.

25:11.925 --> 25:13.224
I'm leaving here.

25:13.226 --> 25:14.793
Tonight.

25:16.997 --> 25:19.063
But...

25:20.333 --> 25:23.935
...what am I supposed to do?

25:23.937 --> 25:27.138
I don't know who I am
if I'm not your mother.

25:33.914 --> 25:37.949
Honestly, if that is really true,

25:37.951 --> 25:39.083
you should kill yourself.

25:40.854 --> 25:42.921
You should do it even if it isn't.

26:05.111 --> 26:08.780
? Listen to the girl ?

26:08.782 --> 26:12.150
? As she takes on half the world ?

26:12.152 --> 26:16.855
? Moving up and so alive ?

26:16.857 --> 26:21.492
? In her honey-dripping... ?

26:21.494 --> 26:25.296
? Eating up the scum ?

26:25.298 --> 26:28.399
? It's the hardest thing for ?

26:28.401 --> 26:29.968
? Me to do ?

26:47.554 --> 26:49.821
Are you having some car trouble?

26:53.994 --> 26:56.394
Picked a pretty shitty place for it.

26:56.396 --> 26:59.497
? Just like honey... ?

27:01.201 --> 27:02.800
These streets can be dangerous.

27:40.073 --> 27:42.707
? Simple death ?

27:42.709 --> 27:44.409
? Feels infinite ?

27:44.411 --> 27:45.910
I didn't mean to just show up like this.

27:45.912 --> 27:47.211
I tried calling.

27:47.213 --> 27:48.913
I kept getting your voice mail.

27:48.915 --> 27:50.982
Yeah, the service in here
is pretty much shit.

27:54.788 --> 27:56.054
Scotch.

27:56.056 --> 27:58.523
Soda pop.

27:59.292 --> 28:01.726
? Dangerous religion ?

28:02.963 --> 28:05.663
? All we have left to learn... ?

28:05.665 --> 28:07.265
Am I interrupting something?

28:07.267 --> 28:08.433
You're fidgety.

28:08.435 --> 28:10.435
No.

28:10.437 --> 28:13.071
I'm just... I'm just a little
preoccupied with a case.

28:13.073 --> 28:14.505
You look terrible.

28:14.507 --> 28:16.007
When's the last time you slept?

28:16.009 --> 28:18.076
I'm fine, Alex.

28:20.246 --> 28:22.013
Maybe you should get a real drink.

28:22.015 --> 28:23.581
I mean, it's obvious you need one.

28:26.086 --> 28:27.852
Why would you say that to me?

28:27.854 --> 28:30.088
You're not in AA-- you don't
have a drinking problem.

28:30.090 --> 28:32.824
You need to give up this
obsession with control.

28:32.826 --> 28:34.525
I need to stay sharp.

28:34.527 --> 28:36.761
Well, you might need one in a minute.

28:36.763 --> 28:38.563
Why?

28:46.639 --> 28:48.639
What is this?

28:48.641 --> 28:50.274
I don't expect you to
sign them right away.

28:50.276 --> 28:52.844
I know you were gonna
want to look them over.

28:54.114 --> 28:56.114
No.

28:56.116 --> 28:57.648
Alex, not now.

28:57.650 --> 28:59.150
John, we have to.

28:59.152 --> 29:01.052
For each other, for our daughter.

29:01.054 --> 29:04.155
I think this is why Scarlett
is telling these wild stories,

29:04.157 --> 29:05.390
'cause we haven't moved on.

29:07.060 --> 29:08.860
I mean, a divorce?

29:08.862 --> 29:11.362
I don't want a divorce,
I-I never did-- I-I love you.

29:11.364 --> 29:12.864
And I love you, too.

29:12.866 --> 29:14.365
But it's not enough, not anymore.

29:14.367 --> 29:16.367
I know it's been rough with me
out of the house, but...

29:16.369 --> 29:18.069
It hasn't been rough.

29:18.071 --> 29:20.671
It hasn't been rough at all--
in fact, it's been great.

29:20.673 --> 29:23.074
I didn't think that I
could do it, but I can.

29:23.076 --> 29:25.076
I don't think you should come back.

29:25.078 --> 29:27.078
It'll just make things
harder for everyone,

29:27.080 --> 29:29.080
because, in the end, this
is what we need to do.

29:29.082 --> 29:31.582
Please.

29:31.584 --> 29:34.085
Please, please don't
tear this family apart.

29:34.087 --> 29:36.054
I'm not the one tearing
our family apart.

29:36.056 --> 29:38.990
Someone else did that
when they stole our son.

29:41.995 --> 29:43.995
John.

29:47.167 --> 29:48.399
John.

29:48.401 --> 29:50.468
Stay. Stay.

29:53.339 --> 29:55.206
Something's wrong with me.

29:55.208 --> 29:58.509
I-I think I'm going crazy.

29:58.511 --> 30:01.779
I feel like I'm seeing things.

30:03.016 --> 30:05.083
Let's get you back to your room, okay?

30:11.024 --> 30:13.024
I'm so sorry.

30:13.026 --> 30:15.793
That's clumsy of me.

30:15.795 --> 30:17.595
You never need to apologize

30:17.597 --> 30:20.064
for pouring a glass of Chateau Margaux.

30:20.066 --> 30:21.933
I was afraid you'd think
this was too much.

30:21.935 --> 30:23.201
You mean the dress?

30:23.203 --> 30:25.736
The night out on the town?

30:25.738 --> 30:27.572
This nightcap?

30:27.574 --> 30:30.074
You know I'm gay. I'm not stupid.

30:30.076 --> 30:33.077
We're destined
for something much more...

30:33.079 --> 30:35.847
intimate.

30:45.458 --> 30:50.061
What if I told you...
Will Drake had to die?

30:57.103 --> 30:59.303
Then you know the truth.

31:01.908 --> 31:03.741
The well is dry.

31:07.113 --> 31:11.115
Just yesterday I drew a pair
of Bermudas in cannabis print.

31:11.117 --> 31:13.851
So much for the West Coast influence.

31:16.823 --> 31:19.357
I happen to think you're a genius.

31:19.359 --> 31:22.660
But you've been comfortable
for far too long.

31:22.662 --> 31:25.196
You need to burn...

31:25.198 --> 31:27.498
so you can rise from the ashes.

31:29.002 --> 31:31.068
Kill Will.

31:35.275 --> 31:38.309
You're giving me dangerous thoughts.

31:38.311 --> 31:41.646
All great ideas are deadly.

31:41.648 --> 31:43.614
I feel the same way with you right now

31:43.616 --> 31:45.950
as I did when I kissed my first man.

31:49.322 --> 31:51.155
How many times have you been
with a woman?

31:51.157 --> 31:52.123
A few.

31:52.125 --> 31:54.091
But they all ended...

31:55.295 --> 31:57.128
...unfulfilled.

31:57.130 --> 31:59.463
No danger in that tonight.

32:07.640 --> 32:10.241
What is this shit?

32:10.243 --> 32:14.178
Where did you get the balls
to eat out of my dish, man?

32:14.180 --> 32:15.980
I'll call you later.

32:15.982 --> 32:18.249
By the way,

32:18.251 --> 32:20.218
you're hard.

32:39.272 --> 32:42.373
So that's it.

32:42.375 --> 32:44.375
It's just over between us?

32:44.377 --> 32:45.576
Don't be such a child.

32:45.578 --> 32:47.178
What am I suppose to think?

32:47.180 --> 32:49.347
I mean, I don't even get it.
All he has is money.

32:49.349 --> 32:51.716
Then you do get it.

32:51.718 --> 32:53.451
What? You're rich.

32:54.387 --> 32:56.354
I used to be.

33:01.527 --> 33:03.527
And then I met Bernie.

33:03.529 --> 33:05.796
Madoff was very good

33:05.798 --> 33:08.532
at separating people from their money,

33:08.534 --> 33:10.234
because he'd make you beg

33:10.236 --> 33:11.969
to give it to him.

33:11.971 --> 33:13.537
All my rich friends got richer,

33:13.539 --> 33:16.607
20% return every year.

33:16.609 --> 33:19.210
But he wouldn't take mine,
not until he could get it all.

33:19.212 --> 33:21.245
The stocks,

33:21.247 --> 33:23.314
the bonds,

33:23.316 --> 33:24.582
the hotel.

33:24.584 --> 33:27.251
Bernie went to prison,

33:27.253 --> 33:29.120
and I lost everything.

33:29.122 --> 33:31.689
So that's why you didn't
want me to kill Drake?

33:34.761 --> 33:37.962
Will Drake can't die

33:37.964 --> 33:42.400
until after I marry him

33:42.402 --> 33:45.903
and take every goddamn penny.

33:59.185 --> 34:01.319
Jesus Christ.

34:01.321 --> 34:03.354
It's no wonder you're in such a state,

34:03.356 --> 34:05.890
sleeping five feet away from all this.

34:07.093 --> 34:09.427
I don't do much sleeping anymore.

34:09.429 --> 34:11.262
Which is why you're gonna take these.

34:11.264 --> 34:13.664
Drink them down.

34:15.467 --> 34:17.101
You don't have a fever.

34:17.103 --> 34:18.768
You just need some rest.

34:18.771 --> 34:21.005
A few hours sleep,
and everything will be clearer.

34:21.007 --> 34:23.373
Okay?

34:39.058 --> 34:41.891
I'm so sorry, Alex.

34:41.893 --> 34:45.496
I'm sorry I couldn't keep
our family together.

34:45.498 --> 34:47.398
I'm sorry...

34:47.400 --> 34:50.201
I couldn't bring
your boy back home to you.

34:53.072 --> 34:55.672
I know.

34:55.675 --> 34:57.908
It's not your fault.

34:57.910 --> 35:00.044
I know how much you loved him.

35:00.046 --> 35:01.712
More than me,

35:01.714 --> 35:03.514
more than Scarlett.

35:03.516 --> 35:05.049
John.

35:05.051 --> 35:06.584
It's okay.

35:06.586 --> 35:09.019
I never minded.

35:09.021 --> 35:11.389
That's how I love you.

35:32.178 --> 35:34.945
Let's have another baby.

35:34.947 --> 35:37.415
Jesus.

35:38.351 --> 35:40.384
What am I doing?

35:40.386 --> 35:42.119
We still love each other.

35:44.457 --> 35:47.458
The divorce papers are here.

35:47.460 --> 35:50.494
If you have any questions,
just call the lawyer.

36:25.765 --> 36:28.165
Is this hell?

36:28.167 --> 36:29.900
No.

36:29.902 --> 36:31.469
If this were hell, I'd be the one

36:31.471 --> 36:35.005
in that awful Zara knockoff
that you're wearing.

37:12.144 --> 37:14.879
Holden?

37:16.148 --> 37:17.715
Hi, Mommy.

37:45.378 --> 37:47.811
Get the lead out, will you?

37:47.813 --> 37:49.513
I'm terrified of needles.

37:49.515 --> 37:52.182
I just want this over with.

37:52.184 --> 37:53.484
First, you need to tell me

37:53.486 --> 37:55.586
why I should be doing you this kindness,

37:55.588 --> 37:58.389
when I could just push you
right out that window,

37:58.391 --> 37:59.690
even things up.

37:59.692 --> 38:00.858
Come on.

38:00.860 --> 38:03.394
You're not gonna torment me now.

38:03.396 --> 38:04.995
I think it would be good for you

38:04.997 --> 38:06.597
to talk about why you want to die.

38:06.599 --> 38:08.232
G...

38:08.234 --> 38:10.734
Entertain me with your self-loathing.

38:13.039 --> 38:15.773
It's not about why die.

38:15.775 --> 38:17.841
It's about

38:17.843 --> 38:19.610
why continue to live.

38:23.015 --> 38:25.616
I can't think of a single reason.

38:27.053 --> 38:29.553
I guess I'm just not lovable.

38:29.555 --> 38:30.921
Now, what's to say.

38:30.923 --> 38:34.592
My own son hates me.

38:36.228 --> 38:37.695
He always has.

38:37.697 --> 38:42.700
You know, I see people
laughing and smiling

38:42.702 --> 38:45.536
and I cannot for the life of me

38:45.538 --> 38:48.072
understand why.

38:48.074 --> 38:50.608
I just don't get the joke anymore.

38:53.579 --> 38:55.546
I am the joke.

39:10.463 --> 39:11.729
Hang on.

39:12.665 --> 39:14.732
We are going total bye-bye,

39:14.734 --> 39:16.567
right?

39:16.569 --> 39:18.502
You swear

39:18.504 --> 39:20.838
you don't have
any unfinished business here?

39:20.840 --> 39:23.741
Because I am stuck
in this place, thanks to you,

39:23.743 --> 39:26.910
so I want to be one 100% sure
that when I do this,

39:26.912 --> 39:31.215
I am done with your miserable old ass.

39:32.785 --> 39:34.585
In other words,

39:34.587 --> 39:38.288
don't haunt my hallways, bitch.

39:38.290 --> 39:40.791
I want nothing more

39:40.793 --> 39:44.294
than the dark silence of death itself.

39:44.296 --> 39:46.697
Well, you've come to the right girl.

40:13.659 --> 40:14.792
How many junkies

40:14.794 --> 40:16.860
did you feed on, Donovan?

40:21.801 --> 40:23.567
You're no good to anyone

40:23.569 --> 40:25.636
in this condition,
so I'm gonna clean you up,

40:25.638 --> 40:26.837
get that poison

40:26.839 --> 40:28.806
out of your blood.

40:28.808 --> 40:30.741
And then we'll see

40:30.743 --> 40:33.544
if you can be of any use to me.

40:33.546 --> 40:34.912
Who the hell are you?

40:34.914 --> 40:37.381
Now, that's the wrong question.

40:37.383 --> 40:39.850
What you should be asking is

40:39.852 --> 40:43.087
who was I?

40:45.424 --> 40:48.225
Somebody order room service?

40:48.227 --> 40:50.461
I was the queen of them all.

40:51.263 --> 40:54.231
No, we ordered hookers.

40:57.436 --> 40:58.836
Get on your knees.

40:59.872 --> 41:02.506
Yeah.

41:15.287 --> 41:18.856
I don't get on my knees for no man.

41:18.858 --> 41:19.690
Cut!

41:19.692 --> 41:20.758
Whoo.

41:20.760 --> 41:22.025
Okay, guys.

41:22.027 --> 41:23.293
That looked good.

41:25.798 --> 41:27.197
I had come to Hollywood

41:27.199 --> 41:29.399
with barely a high school education

41:29.401 --> 41:31.301
and no prospects.

41:31.303 --> 41:34.705
It wasn't long before I was a star.

41:37.109 --> 41:38.742
My pictures grossed ten,

41:38.744 --> 41:41.478
15 times what they cost to produce.

41:41.480 --> 41:43.814
Somebody was making money.

41:43.816 --> 41:45.783
It just wasn't me.

41:45.785 --> 41:49.319
They call what we did B-movies.

41:49.321 --> 41:51.288
I wanted more.

41:51.290 --> 41:53.924
A chance, Mr. Samuels.

41:53.926 --> 41:56.326
That's all I'm asking.

41:56.328 --> 41:59.630
Before you cast Jane Fonda,

41:59.632 --> 42:01.231
just let me read.

42:01.233 --> 42:03.901
The role of Sally Hyde
is going to require...

42:03.903 --> 42:05.736
A white woman.

42:05.738 --> 42:07.371
A serious actress.

42:08.574 --> 42:11.308
I'm very serious.

42:13.245 --> 42:15.078
I'll tell you what.

42:15.080 --> 42:16.747
I've taken a room at the hotel.

42:16.749 --> 42:18.582
Why don't you come up for a drink,

42:18.584 --> 42:19.850
and we can talk more about it.

42:19.852 --> 42:21.819
Ramona Royale.

42:21.821 --> 42:24.454
What an honor.

42:24.456 --> 42:27.858
I've seen all your pictures.

42:27.860 --> 42:30.160
You should go.

42:33.032 --> 42:34.932
Now.

42:39.338 --> 42:42.172
What did you just do?

42:42.174 --> 42:44.608
Saved you from making

42:44.610 --> 42:46.610
a humiliating mistake.

42:46.612 --> 42:48.946
All she'd done

42:48.948 --> 42:52.883
was look at that producer,
and he'd turn tail and run.

42:52.885 --> 42:55.519
Now she was looking at me.

42:55.521 --> 42:57.855
But I didn't feel like running.

42:59.792 --> 43:01.058
She was this rarified,

43:01.060 --> 43:02.893
timeless creature.

43:02.895 --> 43:04.127
She knew everything

43:04.129 --> 43:08.198
about art, literature, fashion.

43:08.200 --> 43:10.968
This was the world I wanted to live in,

43:10.970 --> 43:13.804
and she promised I could--

43:13.806 --> 43:15.205
forever.

43:37.396 --> 43:40.964
It was glorious.

43:42.935 --> 43:44.601
She taught me I could be a lady

43:44.603 --> 43:46.837
and badass.

43:46.839 --> 43:49.439
There was nothing I couldn't be...

43:59.952 --> 44:04.054
...except hers forever.

44:09.762 --> 44:12.262
Prophet Moses was in the vanguard

44:12.264 --> 44:14.965
of those early, heady days,

44:14.967 --> 44:18.035
back when Tupac and Biggie
were making some noise.

44:18.037 --> 44:20.137
But he hadn't broken through yet.

44:20.139 --> 44:21.972
Which is why the record company

44:21.974 --> 44:25.375
put him up at the Cortez
and not the Four Seasons.

44:25.377 --> 44:27.811
Mo was a poet.

44:27.813 --> 44:30.380
And he was, without exception,

44:30.382 --> 44:33.283
the most beautiful man

44:33.285 --> 44:35.285
I had ever seen.

44:35.287 --> 44:36.787
I always thought

44:36.789 --> 44:39.156
she was the great love of my life.

44:39.158 --> 44:40.824
I was wrong.

44:40.826 --> 44:43.260
It was Mo.

44:50.936 --> 44:54.805
And I aimed to be with him forever.

45:11.523 --> 45:13.991
You ready, baby?

45:13.993 --> 45:16.093
I'm ready.

45:44.790 --> 45:47.991
It's sad.

45:47.993 --> 45:49.426
He could have had a future.

45:50.662 --> 45:51.862
Who the hell are you?

45:51.864 --> 45:52.963
Mo, Mo!

45:52.965 --> 45:54.131
No, don't.

45:54.133 --> 45:57.067
She must have really loved you.

46:02.374 --> 46:04.741
What she couldn't have,

46:04.743 --> 46:07.744
was one of her creations

46:07.746 --> 46:09.146
creating something else.

46:09.148 --> 46:12.382
There can only be one queen.

46:12.384 --> 46:15.485
She took away from me

46:15.487 --> 46:17.154
the only thing

46:17.156 --> 46:20.057
that I ever really cared about.

46:20.059 --> 46:24.094
And I plan to do the same thing to her.

46:24.096 --> 46:26.530
You think by killing me

46:26.532 --> 46:28.065
you'll get your revenge?

46:28.067 --> 46:30.167
Not you, fool.

46:31.003 --> 46:33.570
Those babies she made.

46:33.572 --> 46:37.340
But I need access.

46:39.111 --> 46:41.511
Someone on the inside.

46:41.513 --> 46:44.381
And that someone

46:44.383 --> 46:46.450
is gonna be you.

46:49.354 --> 46:52.289
She dumped me last Tuesday.

47:03.936 --> 47:06.136
You can go.

47:37.903 --> 47:39.469
I thought you'd left us

47:39.471 --> 47:41.238
for good.

47:45.911 --> 47:47.978
It's a pretty humbling feeling

47:47.980 --> 47:50.080
when you realize you have nowhere to go.

47:50.082 --> 47:52.149
And what's out there for me?

47:52.151 --> 47:54.117
I've got no money,

47:54.119 --> 47:56.987
no friends I can crash with.

47:56.989 --> 48:01.825
Pretty hard to explain away
a 20-year gap in my résumé.

48:01.827 --> 48:03.860
And I've got a floppy
appendage between my legs

48:03.862 --> 48:06.663
which keeps me from
wearing pencil skirts.

48:06.665 --> 48:09.699
We all have our flaws, kitten.

48:13.672 --> 48:16.206
I thought you were an actor.

48:16.208 --> 48:18.108
You don't have to have a résumé

48:18.110 --> 48:21.444
to be beautiful
or talent to be an actor.

48:21.446 --> 48:23.446
Just ask Laurence Harvey.

48:23.448 --> 48:24.848
I'm not an actor.

48:24.850 --> 48:26.283
Four years of auditioning

48:26.285 --> 48:27.884
and I booked one

48:27.886 --> 48:30.520
under five on The Colbys.

48:32.124 --> 48:33.623
Here's some moonshine for you.

48:33.625 --> 48:34.724
I did get to work
with Charlton Heston, though--

48:34.726 --> 48:36.126
not everyone can say that.

48:36.128 --> 48:38.695
I don't even have a room at this hotel.

48:38.697 --> 48:41.631
I have got nothing.

48:41.633 --> 48:42.899
No one.

48:42.901 --> 48:44.467
For eternity.

48:44.469 --> 48:46.870
No pity party in my bar!

48:46.872 --> 48:49.239
Especially when the guest of honor

48:49.241 --> 48:51.241
can't see that he's the luckiest man

48:51.243 --> 48:52.409
who ever checked into the Hotel Cortez.

48:52.411 --> 48:55.879
You think you've tasted humility

48:55.881 --> 48:57.214
out there on the streets?

48:57.216 --> 48:58.715
You ain't tasted shit, young man.

48:58.717 --> 48:59.983
I know,

48:59.985 --> 49:02.419
because I have.

49:04.890 --> 49:06.756
You should be ashamed of yourself

49:06.758 --> 49:09.159
for abusing your mother. I abused her?

49:09.161 --> 49:13.663
I do not deny that that woman
is horrible. Horrible.

49:13.665 --> 49:16.366
But in the next hundred years of living,

49:16.368 --> 49:19.069
you may find someone
who treats you better,

49:19.071 --> 49:20.937
who screws you better,

49:20.939 --> 49:23.573
who makes you laugh more than cry.

49:23.575 --> 49:25.742
You'll never find anyone

49:25.744 --> 49:29.079
who loves you as much as she does.

49:44.296 --> 49:46.696
I'm not dead.

49:46.698 --> 49:48.365
Jesus.

49:48.367 --> 49:49.966
You're unbelievable.

49:49.968 --> 49:52.636
I gave you enough to kill
an entire marching band.

49:59.778 --> 50:02.479
Plan B.

50:06.585 --> 50:08.318
Jesus, Iris.

50:25.337 --> 50:27.304
Shouldn't be long now.

51:01.373 --> 51:03.440
Ma?

51:07.379 --> 51:09.179
Ma?

51:09.181 --> 51:11.281
Shit.

51:11.283 --> 51:13.983
Ma, it's Dono.

51:13.985 --> 51:15.885
Ma!

51:15.887 --> 51:17.687
She's resting.

51:17.689 --> 51:20.290
Come back later.
I need to talk with her.

51:20.292 --> 51:22.459
You leave her alone.

51:22.461 --> 51:24.294
She's finally at peace.

51:24.296 --> 51:26.463
No, Ma, no, no.

51:26.465 --> 51:27.497
What did you do?

51:27.499 --> 51:28.398
I didn't do anything.

51:28.400 --> 51:30.400
Nothing she didn't ask me to do.

51:30.402 --> 51:31.501
No, no.

51:31.503 --> 51:33.403
No.

51:33.405 --> 51:35.205
She...

51:35.207 --> 51:36.406
She can't be dead.

51:36.408 --> 51:37.841
She's all I've got.

51:37.843 --> 51:39.709
Come on, man.

51:39.711 --> 51:42.412
You told her you wanted her dead.

51:42.414 --> 51:45.915
You bitch.

51:48.387 --> 51:50.487
What are you doing?

51:51.423 --> 51:52.522
No, don't do that.

51:56.228 --> 51:58.428
Come back, Ma.

51:58.430 --> 52:00.864
Come back to me, Mommy.

52:00.866 --> 52:03.233
Come back to me.

52:05.404 --> 52:09.272
There you go, there you go.

52:09.274 --> 52:11.608
Yeah. Yeah.

52:11.610 --> 52:15.512
Now there's some twisted poetic justice.
