05:26.816 --> 05:29.220
And if you didn't have
such a nice ass.

05:31.888 --> 05:33.588
Where is that little

05:33.590 --> 05:36.490
peachy ass of mine?
[giggling]

05:36.492 --> 05:39.394
Little juicy, peachy ass.
[giggling]

05:39.396 --> 05:42.800
It's like a little alien

She came for two days before...

08:03.973 --> 08:06.240
Anyway...
Stan, Dimitri, my associates.

08:06.242 --> 08:07.475
Hi.

08:07.477 --> 08:08.545
- Hi.
- Hi...

08:14.283 --> 08:16.149
I'll leave you guys to it.

08:16.151 --> 08:18.054

09:54.284 --> 09:56.517
As soon as I can,
I'll fly far away.

09:56.519 --> 09:57.654
Tell me where.

09:58.088 --> 10:01.188
I'll book my plane
ticket right now.

10:01.190 --> 10:02.325

10:09.598 --> 10:12.667
Everything goes faster.

10:12.669 --> 10:15.572
And... you can be noticed in no time.
[phone vibrating]

10:24.580 --> 10:26.550
And be noticed as what?

10:27.717 --> 10:29.119
I don't know.

10:30.285 --> 10:32.356
Just to be noticed?

10:33.790 --> 10:36.260
You'd have to be blind
not to notice you.

10:45.702 --> 10:47.804
- Fuck. Leave it.
- What is it?

10:49.905 --> 10:51.141
Peyote.

10:52.574 --> 10:55.743
A local, highly powerful
hallucinogenic. This shit

10:55.745 --> 10:57.512
could flatten a football team.

10:57.514 --> 10:58.515
It's for me!

11:00.150 --> 11:02.716
- For tonight!
- Hey.

11:02.718 --> 11:06.155
This, plus weapons, is a guaranteed
accident, you fucking morons.

11:07.924 --> 11:11.192
A few years ago, a Polish guy
got so high on this shit,

11:11.194 --> 11:14.461
he sawed his own leg off
without feeling a damn thing.

11:14.463 --> 11:16.764
He died without a drop
of blood in his body.

11:16.766 --> 11:18.798
[whistles]

11:18.800 --> 11:21.504
Here you go, beautiful. Could you
go and hide it somewhere safe?

11:45.727 --> 11:49.532
[dance music]

11:52.401 --> 11:54.237
Uh-oh, here comes trouble.

12:01.276 --> 12:03.379
[catcalls]

12:07.916 --> 12:09.752
[catcalls]

12:10.953 --> 12:12.655
Oh, yeah!

12:22.732 --> 12:25.434
No, no no no. No.

13:03.839 --> 13:04.907
Wow.

14:28.724 --> 14:29.792
[door closing]

14:36.531 --> 14:38.834
Hey! There she is.

14:41.904 --> 14:43.974
Oopsie, hang on a sec.

14:47.843 --> 14:49.478
There we go.

14:51.079 --> 14:52.348
[dragging]

15:04.394 --> 15:08.028
Oh. Richard went to give our
passports to the gamekeeper.

15:08.030 --> 15:09.833
It'll take him all morning.

15:11.467 --> 15:12.501
Oh.

15:13.835 --> 15:16.637
And Dimitri
is nursing a hangover.

15:16.639 --> 15:19.810
Which will also take all morning.
[awkward laugh]

15:22.044 --> 15:23.380
So.

15:24.447 --> 15:25.849
It's just the two of us.

15:37.794 --> 15:39.596
[tense music]

16:11.928 --> 16:14.628
- I'm gonna start packing.
- Oh.

16:14.630 --> 16:16.066
If I want to be
ready on time.

16:30.780 --> 16:33.717
[dramatic music]

16:56.738 --> 16:59.539
Oh, sorry,
I didn't mean to scare you.

16:59.541 --> 17:02.144
Oh, no, it's OK, you
just surprised me, that's all.

17:05.615 --> 17:08.652
Hey, this is a nice bedroom.

17:11.988 --> 17:13.022
Yes, it is.

17:14.089 --> 17:15.657
[nervous chuckle]

17:16.559 --> 17:20.059
You know, it really is a shame

17:20.060 --> 17:24.067
we didn't have more time to get
to know each other better.

17:29.070 --> 17:30.674
Call me when you can.

17:32.675 --> 17:33.809
We could do...

17:35.578 --> 17:36.913
a thing or two...

17:37.980 --> 17:38.982
together.

17:43.552 --> 17:46.522
I don't know
if I'll have time with work.

17:46.722 --> 17:49.593
Oh, work.
[laughs]

17:49.959 --> 17:53.730
[clears throat] So now
you're a fucking politician.

17:53.930 --> 17:55.131
[short laugh]

18:02.637 --> 18:04.941
What is it
you don't like about me?

18:10.146 --> 18:11.711
No, nothing.

18:11.713 --> 18:13.849
I just want to know, so...

18:14.951 --> 18:16.520
tell me.

18:16.719 --> 18:19.088
What is it
you don't like about me?

18:26.896 --> 18:30.567
You're... You're not
my type, that's all.

18:31.166 --> 18:32.202
Oh.

18:34.069 --> 18:35.972
Why am I not your type?

18:44.046 --> 18:45.248
You're...

18:51.052 --> 18:52.222
you're too small.

18:53.955 --> 18:54.925
Oh.

18:56.157 --> 18:57.758
I like taller guys,
that's all.

18:57.760 --> 18:59.729
There we go! [laughter]

19:05.867 --> 19:06.970
[sighs]

19:11.640 --> 19:14.810
And I haven't changed height
since yesterday, have I?

19:22.885 --> 19:26.987
I asked you a simple question.

19:26.989 --> 19:30.124
Even for your tiny
little oyster brain,

19:30.126 --> 19:32.095
it shouldn't be
too difficult to understand.

19:32.994 --> 19:34.330
So, I'll ask you again.

19:36.065 --> 19:38.201
Did my height

19:39.734 --> 19:40.837
change

19:42.137 --> 19:43.706
since yesterday?

19:46.876 --> 19:48.345
No.

19:49.211 --> 19:52.048
And yet,
you seemed to like me yesterday.

19:53.115 --> 19:55.182
No, but I...

19:55.184 --> 19:58.117
Yeah, yeah, yeah. When we were
dancing together last night,

19:58.119 --> 20:00.788
everything was very clear.

20:00.790 --> 20:04.090
You came onto me
like a pussy in heat,

20:04.092 --> 20:06.960
rubbing yourself against me,

20:06.962 --> 20:08.632
turning me on.

20:09.932 --> 20:11.464
And now, suddenly,

20:11.466 --> 20:13.369
I'm not your type?

20:14.470 --> 20:16.903
Like that, boom.

20:16.905 --> 20:20.173
During the night,
I've become too small for you.

20:20.175 --> 20:21.243
[slam]

20:23.145 --> 20:25.248
Yesterday,
you were dying for it.

20:28.084 --> 20:30.220
And now you're apparently...

20:31.453 --> 20:33.053
Stop.

20:33.055 --> 20:34.821
Richard will
be back anytime soon.

20:34.823 --> 20:37.793
[mocking] Oh, Richard.

20:38.927 --> 20:40.129
[grunt]

20:42.263 --> 20:44.131
[creaking]

20:44.133 --> 20:46.736

[loud engines on TV]

22:22.964 --> 22:24.934
[slamming]

23:19.555 --> 23:20.824
Hey.

23:22.892 --> 23:24.460
Call the helicopter.

23:25.527 --> 23:27.160
Call the helicopter.
I want to go home.

23:27.162 --> 23:30.396
Hey, calm down,
calm down.

23:30.398 --> 23:32.999
I'll take care
of everything, OK?

23:33.001 --> 23:34.103
Don't worry.

23:42.944 --> 23:44.580
[door slams]

24:04.066 --> 24:06.035
How long did I sleep for?

24:08.103 --> 24:10.206
- Has the helicopter arrived yet?
- Shh...

24:12.675 --> 24:16.111
Everything's OK.
I fixed everything.

24:18.414 --> 24:21.117
I made a few phone calls
to find you a job.

24:22.384 --> 24:23.519
In Canada.

24:26.454 --> 24:28.457
It's practically Los Angeles.

24:33.127 --> 24:35.394
That's the amount I transferred
to an account for you,

24:35.396 --> 24:37.200
you can use it
as you please.

24:39.534 --> 24:42.437
Jen, this is the possibility
to change your life,

24:43.405 --> 24:44.604
to fulfill your dreams.

24:44.606 --> 24:46.309
I want to go home right now.

24:49.011 --> 24:51.211
Call that fucking helicopter.

24:51.213 --> 24:53.646
Baby, baby, baby...
Don't act like a child.

24:53.648 --> 24:55.749
You know that's not possible.

24:55.751 --> 24:58.021
If you love me,
think about me.

24:59.154 --> 25:01.454
OK, they fucked up big time,

25:01.456 --> 25:04.193
but you're so damn beautiful,
it's hard to resist you.

25:05.424 --> 25:07.193
Come on. Jen,
they'll come and apologize

25:07.195 --> 25:08.494
and we'll forget
about the whole thing.

25:08.496 --> 25:10.262
You call
the goddamn helicopter!

25:10.264 --> 25:12.434
Or I'll call your wife
and tell her everything!

25:16.137 --> 25:17.770
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

25:17.772 --> 25:19.141
You little whore.

25:20.776 --> 25:22.275
You dare threaten me or
fuck things up in my life?

25:22.277 --> 25:23.442
Don't you ever talk
about my wife.

25:23.444 --> 25:25.615
Don't you ever say her name.

25:28.149 --> 25:29.251
[crying]

25:45.634 --> 25:47.703
[dramatic music]

26:35.751 --> 26:37.453
Hey, stop! Stop! Stop!

26:38.252 --> 26:39.554
Jen, look at me.

26:40.789 --> 26:42.588
I'm sorry about the slap.

26:42.590 --> 26:45.592
I didn't mean to hurt you.
It's just... stress.

26:45.594 --> 26:47.130
I lashed out
without thinking.

26:48.629 --> 26:50.232
Give me your phone.

26:51.532 --> 26:52.867
Give me the fucking phone!

26:55.736 --> 26:58.273
I'm calling the chopper, I don't
want to hear another word about it.

26:59.707 --> 27:01.309
What a fucking mess.

27:03.479 --> 27:06.480
Hey Roberto, it's Richard.
How are you?

27:06.482 --> 27:10.282
I'm very good, thank you. Listen,
we planned a pick-up at 2:30pm.

27:10.284 --> 27:13.119
Yeah. And I would like
to make it earlier.

27:13.121 --> 27:14.556
Yeah, as soon as possible.

27:15.757 --> 27:17.093
Perfect.

27:17.893 --> 27:19.362
OK, thanks.

27:21.363 --> 27:23.699
He'll be there in 30 minutes.

27:25.901 --> 27:27.170
OK?
