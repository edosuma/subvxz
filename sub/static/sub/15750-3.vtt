00:59.852 --> 01:02.980
(plants rustling)

01:47.483 --> 01:49.402
(man hawking newspapers)

01:49.569 --> 01:50.570
Read all about it!

01:50.736 --> 01:52.989
My brother says he wants
to join the Cavalry.

01:53.156 --> 01:54.991
JESSIE: Their uniforms
are ever so smart.

01:55.158 --> 01:56.576
You'd look nice in one, Franco.

01:56.742 --> 01:59.203
You won't catch me
getting on a horse.

01:59.370 --> 02:00.580
What's wrong
with using your legs?

02:00.746 --> 02:02.123
Nothing, if they
look like yours.

02:02.290 --> 02:03.416
Ah…

02:03.583 --> 02:04.750
I've been looking
for you.

02:04.917 --> 02:05.918
Come on.

02:06.085 --> 02:07.920
We need to do the menus
for next week.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.464
Sorry, I forgot.

02:09.630 --> 02:10.965
You could help me out
a bit more, Franco.

02:11.132 --> 02:12.258
I'm busy enough as it is.

02:12.425 --> 02:13.885
This Empire Exhibition's
the last thing I need.

02:14.051 --> 02:16.554
Not very patriotic of you,
Mr. Colleano.

02:16.721 --> 02:18.890
But of course you're Italian,
so why should you care?

02:22.226 --> 02:23.352
Don't take any notice of her.

02:23.519 --> 02:25.897
She's not the first one
to say it.

02:31.444 --> 02:33.613
Has any post arrived for me,
Miss Plunkett?

02:33.779 --> 02:35.865
I'm expecting
a parcel.

02:36.032 --> 02:38.993
Nothing for you
in the first post, Mr. Crabb.

02:40.328 --> 02:43.080
Have you seen Mr. Grove yet
this morning?

02:43.247 --> 02:44.832
Does anyone ever see
Mr. Grove?

02:44.999 --> 02:45.625
(door opens)

02:47.460 --> 02:48.711
MAN: Good morning, Mr.
Selfridge.

02:48.878 --> 02:49.962
Good morning.

02:52.256 --> 02:54.050
Can I ask, Mr. Selfridge,
what did Mr. Ridley want?

02:54.217 --> 02:55.301
Our financial position
is strong.

02:55.468 --> 02:57.178
According to Mr. Ridley,

02:57.345 --> 02:59.138
if there is a war,
nobody will shop.

02:59.305 --> 03:01.349
I disagree and told him so.

03:02.642 --> 03:04.727
How are preparations
for next week going?

03:04.894 --> 03:06.354
We've taken out
a great deal of advertising.

03:06.521 --> 03:07.438
That's good.

03:07.605 --> 03:10.066
Empire Week needs to run
like clockwork.

03:10.233 --> 03:12.193
I presume Mr. Grove
knows that?

03:14.111 --> 03:17.156
I'm sure Mr. Grove is aware
of the situation, chief.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.243
He's not even here, is he?

03:24.372 --> 03:26.541
What's wrong
with this man?

04:04.662 --> 04:06.622
What is it?

04:06.789 --> 04:08.874
Do you think, sir,

04:09.041 --> 04:12.545
we're going to fight
the Germans?

04:12.712 --> 04:15.548
Is that
what you think?

04:18.551 --> 04:21.512
Why should I tell you if I did?

04:35.776 --> 04:38.821
All she wants is
a little reassurance.

04:38.988 --> 04:41.907
I know.

04:42.074 --> 04:45.161
So why not give it to her?

04:47.163 --> 04:49.582
Because it's much more amusing
not to.

04:54.003 --> 04:55.880
Where are you going?

04:56.047 --> 04:57.465
Out.

04:57.632 --> 04:58.633
Where to?

04:58.799 --> 04:59.884
Anywhere.

05:00.051 --> 05:01.844
Away from you.

05:02.011 --> 05:03.095
(chuckles)

05:15.358 --> 05:16.901
(sighs)

05:28.579 --> 05:29.705
(whistling)

05:29.872 --> 05:33.000
(talking quietly)

05:35.252 --> 05:38.005
What have you
got there?

05:43.052 --> 05:44.303
Those are pretty racy!

05:44.470 --> 05:45.763
Wouldn't mind
a bit of that, eh?

05:45.930 --> 05:47.807
None of us would.

05:47.973 --> 05:50.184
What's going on?

05:50.351 --> 05:53.062
Uh… nothing.

06:00.695 --> 06:01.862
AGNES:
Then around the store

06:02.029 --> 06:03.989
there will be several themed
Empire displays.

06:04.156 --> 06:05.282
Fine.

06:05.449 --> 06:06.659
I've set one up
as an example

06:06.826 --> 06:08.911
so that you can see
what I'm trying to achieve.

06:09.078 --> 06:12.039
In Fashion,
We're representing the Raj,

06:12.206 --> 06:14.333
SO…

06:17.920 --> 06:19.630
Good morning,
Mr. Selfridge.

06:19.797 --> 06:21.298
Mr. Thackeray.

06:21.465 --> 06:22.591
Where's my display?

06:22.758 --> 06:25.052
I spent half the night
putting it up.

06:25.219 --> 06:26.679
Your display?

06:26.846 --> 06:30.349
Oh, my dear Miss Towler,
I had no idea.

06:30.516 --> 06:31.600
But I told you…

06:31.767 --> 06:33.060
When I arrived
this morning,

06:33.227 --> 06:35.896
there was this drab little motif
at the center of my department.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.190
I thought I should get rid of it
before the customers arrived.

06:38.357 --> 06:39.108
It wasn't finished.

06:39.275 --> 06:40.276
But I could always
put it back.

06:40.443 --> 06:41.360
It's a bit late
for that.

06:41.527 --> 06:42.778
I suggest this stay

06:42.945 --> 06:45.114
and we find another place
for the Raj,

06:45.281 --> 06:47.366
the Palm Court perhaps?

06:47.533 --> 06:50.661
I'm sure that Mr. Colleano
will oblige.

07:01.130 --> 07:02.631
VICTOR:
I'm not having the rifle.

07:02.798 --> 07:04.508
It'll scare my customers away.

07:04.675 --> 07:07.386
If the tiger hasn't already
given them a heart attack.

07:07.553 --> 07:09.013
These displays
are still in progress.

07:09.180 --> 07:11.223
I'm sure Miss Towler
can adapt them.

07:12.600 --> 07:13.684
Of course I can.

07:15.686 --> 07:17.480
Shall we go downstairs,
Mr. Selfridge?

07:29.074 --> 07:30.159
You're late.

07:31.827 --> 07:34.413
I got caught in a peace rally
at the end of Oxford Street.

07:34.580 --> 07:36.040
It was utter chaos.

07:36.207 --> 07:37.166
Good morning,
Mr. Selfridge!

07:37.333 --> 07:38.292
Good morning,
Miss Hawkins.

07:38.459 --> 07:40.586
AGNES: Many of our
beauty products

07:40.753 --> 07:42.129
are influenced
by the Orient,

07:42.296 --> 07:44.757
so there'll be a display
of Chinese parasols and fans

07:44.924 --> 07:46.091
behind the counter.

07:46.258 --> 07:47.343
Colorful, I hope,

07:47.510 --> 07:48.844
so they attract the eye?

07:49.011 --> 07:50.095
Very colorful,
Miss Hawkins.

07:50.262 --> 07:51.597
Nobody will miss you.

07:51.764 --> 07:53.808
How about Accessories?

07:53.974 --> 07:56.268
Ah, Miss Mardle!

07:56.435 --> 07:57.812
You've come back to us.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.063
Indeed I have,
Mr. Selfridge.

07:59.230 --> 08:00.064
Good morning.

08:00.231 --> 08:01.065
Morning.

08:03.567 --> 08:05.694
Your brother?

08:05.861 --> 08:07.738
Well, we buried him
last week in Geneva.

08:07.905 --> 08:08.864
I am so sorry.

08:09.031 --> 08:09.865
Thank you.

08:11.867 --> 08:13.744
What have you planned
for Accessories, Miss Towler?

08:16.497 --> 08:18.958
I haven't worked it out yet.

08:19.124 --> 08:20.584
But we must have
something.

08:20.751 --> 08:22.002
Beauty is getting
a whole display,

08:22.169 --> 08:23.629
<i>as Miss Hawkins
has informed me-- twice.</i>

08:23.796 --> 08:25.464
GROVE:
And you have less than a week.

08:25.631 --> 08:27.466
It is a bank holiday
on Monday.

08:27.633 --> 08:30.678
A huge amount can be achieved
in a small amount of time,

08:30.845 --> 08:32.763
and I'm sure that
Miss Towler is aware

08:32.929 --> 08:34.557
of how important
this Empire week is.

08:34.722 --> 08:35.558
I am, Mr. Selfridge.

08:35.724 --> 08:37.058
Very good.

08:37.226 --> 08:38.309
Carry on.

08:39.770 --> 08:42.606
My office now, Mr. Grove.

08:49.113 --> 08:52.324
I'm not going to beat
about the bush, Mr. Grove.

08:52.491 --> 08:55.452
I'm disappointed in you.

08:55.619 --> 08:57.621
You're late all the time,
office is a mess,

08:57.788 --> 09:00.249
you're not on top
of Personnel.

09:00.416 --> 09:03.127
That is an unfounded
accusation.

09:03.294 --> 09:04.503
All right, then,

09:04.670 --> 09:06.213
the basics:

09:06.380 --> 09:08.716
how many male staff
do we employ?

09:08.883 --> 09:10.342
Eight hundred and fifty.

09:10.509 --> 09:13.429
Nine hundred
and forty-nine.

09:13.596 --> 09:15.723
Female employees?

09:15.890 --> 09:18.142
I do have this information,
Mr. Selfridge,

09:18.309 --> 09:19.727
just not at my fingertips.

09:19.894 --> 09:24.815
You have to know your people,
otherwise you can't manage them.

09:24.982 --> 09:28.027
This is your
final warning.

09:28.193 --> 09:29.361
Up your game or you're out.

09:33.324 --> 09:34.867
Good evening, sir.

09:35.034 --> 09:37.036
Good evening, Fraser.

09:37.202 --> 09:38.829
Is Mrs. Selfridge in?

09:38.996 --> 09:41.916
I'm afraid not, sir.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.792
(sighs)

09:43.959 --> 09:46.003
But you have a visitor,
Mr. Selfridge.

09:46.170 --> 09:48.380
He's waiting
in the courtyard.

10:03.187 --> 10:05.522
You wouldn't believe
how glad I am to see you.

10:06.899 --> 10:10.069
I just came because
Mrs. Selfridge was kind

10:10.235 --> 10:11.612
and visited me.

10:11.779 --> 10:14.114
I was rude to her.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.491
I wanted to apologize.

10:15.658 --> 10:16.575
She's not here.

10:16.742 --> 10:17.952
Stay for dinner.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.495
Oh, no, thank you.

10:19.662 --> 10:21.330
I have a whole humidor
filled with cigars

10:21.497 --> 10:23.540
that were just delivered.

10:23.707 --> 10:25.960
Someone's got to smoke them
with me.

10:27.419 --> 10:28.587
The same old Harry.

10:30.214 --> 10:32.549
I'm not so sure about that.

10:36.345 --> 10:38.472
Oh, no.

10:41.892 --> 10:43.811
I shouldn't have
let you go.

10:43.978 --> 10:45.396
You couldn't have
stopped me.

10:45.562 --> 10:47.398
No, but it was
the way I did it.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.024
I don't know
what I was thinking.

10:49.191 --> 10:51.902
I lost the greatest
creative director around

10:52.069 --> 10:53.612
and my best friend,

10:53.779 --> 10:56.532
neither of which
have been replaceable.

10:59.910 --> 11:01.370
Is this an apology

11:01.537 --> 11:04.456
from the great
Mr. Selfridge himself?

11:04.623 --> 11:06.375
What am I supposed to do, beg?

11:08.002 --> 11:09.795
I'd like to see that
very much.

11:09.962 --> 11:11.839
(laughing)

11:12.006 --> 11:13.465
Old friend.

11:13.632 --> 11:14.717
Come back to the store.

11:14.883 --> 11:16.010
No.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.636
No, absolutely not.

11:17.803 --> 11:19.930
Why not?

11:20.097 --> 11:21.849
I don't need
your charity, Harry.

11:22.016 --> 11:23.350
It's me who needs you.

11:23.517 --> 11:26.437
The store's a mess, Henri.

11:26.603 --> 11:29.314
My heads of department,
they're bickering,

11:29.481 --> 11:31.275
I'm about to sack
my head of Personnel…

11:31.442 --> 11:33.235
Mr. Grove?

11:33.402 --> 11:34.778
I don't want to.

11:34.945 --> 11:37.281
But if he doesn't pull together,
I'm going to have to.

11:39.616 --> 11:42.536
Well, I am sorry that you have
problems at the store,

11:42.703 --> 11:43.996
but it makes no difference.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.253
Then there's Miss Towler.

11:52.713 --> 11:53.797
Agnes Towler?

11:53.964 --> 11:55.049
Yes.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.425
How is she?

11:56.592 --> 11:58.302
(sighs)

11:58.469 --> 11:59.970
She's the Head
of Display now.

12:00.137 --> 12:02.473
I sent her to Paris
to train under Lafayette.

12:02.639 --> 12:03.932
Yeah?

12:04.099 --> 12:06.185
She's under
a lot of pressure.

12:06.351 --> 12:07.644
We have our Empire week
celebration

12:07.811 --> 12:10.773
and she's struggling.

12:12.441 --> 12:13.942
Come and help her out.

12:14.109 --> 12:16.195
Come on, Henri.

12:16.361 --> 12:17.946
What do you say?

12:38.300 --> 12:39.802
Morning.

12:41.553 --> 12:43.847
Good morning.

12:45.891 --> 12:46.767
Good evening out?

12:46.934 --> 12:48.185
Yes, it was.

12:48.352 --> 12:49.603
Very.

12:49.770 --> 12:52.272
You missed Henri.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.566
He came to visit last night.

12:54.733 --> 12:55.609
Henri was here?

12:55.776 --> 12:56.860
He was coming
to see you.

12:57.027 --> 12:58.654
He wanted to apologize.

12:58.821 --> 13:01.615
He doesn't have anything
to apologize for.

13:03.742 --> 13:06.120
Thank you for finding him, Rose.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.455
He wouldn't have come here
if it hadn't been for you.

13:08.622 --> 13:11.834
Well, that is not
what you thought before.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.211
I was wrong,
and I'm sorry.

13:14.378 --> 13:15.129
Yes, you were.

13:19.591 --> 13:21.260
I'm going to work.

13:26.765 --> 13:28.851
Gordon?

13:29.017 --> 13:31.228
Are you all right?

13:31.395 --> 13:33.856
I hate the fact that you and Pa
aren't getting along.

13:34.022 --> 13:35.941
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to fight in front of you.

13:36.108 --> 13:37.442
He's trying so hard with you.

13:49.246 --> 13:50.330
Where did you get these?

13:57.588 --> 13:59.256
Gordon…
(door slams)

14:02.342 --> 14:03.635
Thank you so much
for coming.

14:03.802 --> 14:06.638
We can't be late for work.

14:06.805 --> 14:09.474
It's only I feel
I need a man's opinion,

14:09.641 --> 14:11.768
and I don't know
who to turn to.

14:11.935 --> 14:14.438
What's this all about?

14:42.633 --> 14:44.885
My brother spent
most of his life abroad.

14:45.052 --> 14:46.845
He never married.

14:47.012 --> 14:52.059
And he left the house
and the contents to you?

14:52.226 --> 14:55.395
It's such a responsibility.

15:01.360 --> 15:03.612
It's a gold mine!

15:03.779 --> 15:05.155
I can't sell
any of it, Roger.

15:05.322 --> 15:06.615
It was his.

15:06.782 --> 15:08.033
It wouldn't feel right.

15:08.200 --> 15:09.576
How many bedrooms are there?

15:09.743 --> 15:11.161
Six.

15:11.328 --> 15:14.623
Well, live here.

15:14.790 --> 15:18.168
Take paying guests.

15:18.335 --> 15:20.963
They'd keep you company
and provide a regular income.

15:21.129 --> 15:25.717
Actually, he left me
an income as well.

15:27.636 --> 15:30.931
You're a woman
of independent means.

15:31.098 --> 15:32.849
It's a great deal to take in.

15:33.016 --> 15:35.060
If I may say so,

15:35.227 --> 15:37.437
it couldn't have happened
to a better person.

15:47.406 --> 15:49.825
Lady Loxley.

15:49.992 --> 15:52.119
BANKER: It's a while since
we've seen you at the bank,

15:52.286 --> 15:53.453
Lady Loxley.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.080
MAE:
Yes, indeed.

16:23.317 --> 16:25.193
(bell rings)

16:34.786 --> 16:37.497
Under no circumstances must
Loxley ever know about this.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.791
I'll make sure of it,
Lady Loxley.

16:41.335 --> 16:42.502
Thank you.

16:43.962 --> 16:45.505
Yes, you may put it away now.

17:04.775 --> 17:06.526
You're Jeremy,
aren't you?

17:06.693 --> 17:08.278
That's right.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.946
I know your father.

17:11.114 --> 17:12.866
I can call you Jeremy,
can't I?

17:13.032 --> 17:15.577
Of course.

17:15.743 --> 17:18.997
Have there been any rumors
around the bank

17:19.164 --> 17:20.415
about my husband?

17:22.250 --> 17:24.086
I couldn't say.

17:24.252 --> 17:29.091
You see, I fear Loxley
has money troubles.

17:29.257 --> 17:32.594
He's so solicitous,
he doesn't want to worry me.

17:32.761 --> 17:35.472
But I'm his wife;
I need to share his burdens.

17:35.639 --> 17:38.225
Is it true?

17:41.186 --> 17:42.729
I did hear my father
talking about it

17:42.896 --> 17:43.980
with my grandfather.

17:44.147 --> 17:46.358
And?

17:48.151 --> 17:49.528
Gambling debts, apparently.

17:49.694 --> 17:52.531
People have asked him
to honor them

17:52.697 --> 17:54.866
because of the uncertain times.

17:55.033 --> 17:56.159
Well, of course.

17:56.326 --> 17:59.663
How bad is it?

18:04.126 --> 18:06.628
My father said Lord Loxley's
all washed up.

18:24.229 --> 18:26.148
PLUNKETT: I said you were
taking no appointments.

18:26.314 --> 18:29.901
And I said Mr. Selfridge
would make an exception for me.

18:36.533 --> 18:37.451
What is it, Lord Loxley?

18:37.617 --> 18:38.827
I am rather busy.

18:38.994 --> 18:40.662
Planning your Empire
celebration?

18:40.829 --> 18:43.582
You've got to ask if there's
anything to celebrate.

18:43.748 --> 18:46.501
We've sucked up
to filthy types in Europe

18:46.668 --> 18:48.170
in order to protect
our foreign interests.

18:48.336 --> 18:50.338
Look at the result.

18:50.505 --> 18:52.883
I haven't got time
to talk politics.

18:53.049 --> 18:55.635
How about politicians, then?

18:55.802 --> 18:59.389
Winston Churchill would like
to open your Empire week.

18:59.556 --> 19:02.184
I saw him last night
at the House.

19:02.350 --> 19:03.810
He likes the fact
that you're

19:03.977 --> 19:05.353
keeping the public happy,
Selfridge.

19:05.520 --> 19:08.315
I suggested to him
that he show up and do his bit.

19:08.482 --> 19:10.525
That's kind of you.

19:10.692 --> 19:12.569
I'll arrange it, then.

19:12.736 --> 19:14.613
Thank you.

19:14.779 --> 19:18.241
Oh, and you know I'm on the
Military Procurement Committee.

19:18.408 --> 19:19.868
No, I didn't.

19:20.035 --> 19:21.119
I need a list

19:21.286 --> 19:22.871
of British leather
manufacturers.

19:23.038 --> 19:26.249
We're in short supply
of military boots.

19:26.416 --> 19:27.834
Getting ready, I'm afraid.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.252
Any thoughts?

19:29.419 --> 19:31.922
I know pretty much every leather
manufacturer in Britain.

19:32.088 --> 19:34.174
Get me some names
as soon as possible.

19:34.341 --> 19:36.218
I'll let the committee know
you've done your bit.

19:53.777 --> 19:55.320
MARDLE: These drawers
are a disgrace.

19:55.487 --> 19:56.863
I go away and everything
falls to pieces.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.950
Where have you been,
Miss Mardle?

20:00.116 --> 20:00.784
Somewhere nice, I hope?

20:00.951 --> 20:03.328
Mr. Leclair!

20:03.495 --> 20:05.372
How wonderful to see you!

20:05.539 --> 20:07.123
You too, looking so well.

20:09.668 --> 20:11.086
Pearls suit you.

20:11.253 --> 20:12.337
Oh!

20:12.504 --> 20:14.297
Uh, they're new.

20:14.464 --> 20:16.925
But then, you always did
notice everything.

20:17.092 --> 20:19.344
Where can I find Miss Towler?

20:23.098 --> 20:24.391
Mr. Grove?

20:32.983 --> 20:37.153
I presume you know that
unless I pull myself together,

20:37.320 --> 20:38.822
I'm out on my ear.

20:38.989 --> 20:40.657
The chief doesn't want that.

20:40.824 --> 20:42.367
None of us do.

20:43.994 --> 20:45.870
I've taken the liberty.

20:46.037 --> 20:47.414
I hope you don't mind.

20:47.581 --> 20:50.834
I ordered these manuals
from America.

20:51.001 --> 20:52.210
Mr. Selfridge
is always talking

20:52.377 --> 20:54.838
about keeping abreast
of innovation.

20:55.005 --> 20:57.716
They contain some rather
interesting ideas.

21:00.427 --> 21:02.095
You sent off for these?

21:02.262 --> 21:03.513
Yes.

21:05.974 --> 21:08.018
To America?

21:10.270 --> 21:12.564
For me?

21:14.149 --> 21:16.067
You'll get through this,
Mr. Grove, I know you will.

21:16.234 --> 21:20.280
Rise to the challenge
like the splendid chap you are.

21:25.577 --> 21:26.703
Good luck.

21:31.916 --> 21:34.669
As you pointed out so clearly
in front of Mr. Selfridge,

21:34.836 --> 21:37.339
the tiger display isn't
going to work in here,

21:37.505 --> 21:38.923
so I'm going to try
something simple

21:39.090 --> 21:42.010
but still Indian in feel:
silk cloths on the tables

21:42.177 --> 21:44.554
and bird cages
out on the terrace.

21:44.721 --> 21:46.598
With live birds
screeching at us all day?

21:46.765 --> 21:48.058
Thanks very much.

21:48.224 --> 21:50.268
What's the matter
with you?

21:50.435 --> 21:52.479
Why are you being
so difficult?

21:52.646 --> 21:54.439
All this?

21:56.024 --> 21:57.984
Some people have got
real problems.

22:01.321 --> 22:02.822
(sighs)

22:05.992 --> 22:07.619
(sighs)

22:10.246 --> 22:11.956
That was a bit harsh.

22:12.123 --> 22:14.125
She's just trying
to do her job.

22:14.292 --> 22:16.211
You're right.

22:16.378 --> 22:18.254
I don't know why
I'm taking it out on her.

22:20.382 --> 22:21.758
I do.

22:23.426 --> 22:26.096
I just wish I could
be normal around her.

22:26.262 --> 22:28.181
Go on, find her.

22:28.348 --> 22:29.432
Say sorry.

22:38.108 --> 22:39.192
Henri?

23:18.273 --> 23:19.357
Agnes?

23:20.900 --> 23:23.069
I've been looking for you
everywhere.

23:23.236 --> 23:25.447
(laughing)

23:25.613 --> 23:27.532
Henri!

23:39.419 --> 23:40.503
Miss Towler,

23:40.670 --> 23:42.672
all grown up.

23:44.799 --> 23:47.093
Why are you here,
Henri?

23:47.260 --> 23:49.471
Why aren't you in America?

23:49.637 --> 23:51.514
What about Valerie?

23:51.681 --> 23:55.101
I thought you were
going out there to be with her?

23:57.437 --> 23:59.439
It did not work out.

23:59.606 --> 24:01.983
I'm sorry.

24:04.569 --> 24:07.155
But the job with
the advertising agency,

24:07.322 --> 24:08.907
that must have been
exciting.

24:09.073 --> 24:11.534
Yes, it was certainly that.

24:14.537 --> 24:15.622
But I want to talk about you.

24:15.789 --> 24:16.873
Head of Display?

24:17.040 --> 24:18.458
It's wonderful.

24:18.625 --> 24:23.546
The problem is
I'm not very good at it.

24:23.713 --> 24:26.216
I don't believe that.

24:26.382 --> 24:28.760
We've got this exhibition
opening next week,

24:28.927 --> 24:31.387
and it's just not right.

24:33.223 --> 24:34.474
Maybe I could help?

24:35.975 --> 24:38.311
Mr. Selfridge has asked me
to come back

24:38.478 --> 24:41.147
just for the Empire
Exhibition.

24:41.314 --> 24:43.066
But if you don't want me to,
I won't.

24:43.233 --> 24:46.778
Henri, please come back.

24:46.945 --> 24:48.738
I need you.

24:48.905 --> 24:50.073
More than anything.

24:57.247 --> 24:58.414
You've been avoiding me.

24:58.581 --> 24:59.666
I haven't.

25:01.417 --> 25:03.670
I'm not angry
about the pictures.

25:06.047 --> 25:09.801
I just want to say that
what they represent…

25:09.968 --> 25:12.387
Well, it's not everything.

25:12.554 --> 25:14.305
Relations between
men and women

25:14.472 --> 25:20.228
should be about love, Gordon,
not just physical intimacy.

25:20.395 --> 25:23.189
Surely they should be
about both.

25:23.356 --> 25:25.108
Isn't that the point
of marriage?

25:25.275 --> 25:26.359
Excuse me?

25:26.526 --> 25:27.819
Since you and Pa
stopped sharing a bedroom,

25:27.986 --> 25:30.071
neither of you
have been happy.

25:30.238 --> 25:32.198
That is not true.

25:32.365 --> 25:34.826
And I wasn't thinking about
your father and myself when…

25:34.993 --> 25:36.119
Maybe you should.

25:36.286 --> 25:37.662
You're making him
miserable.

25:37.829 --> 25:40.206
Over the years, he's made me
fairly miserable too!

25:40.373 --> 25:42.125
Why did you come back
from America at all?

25:42.292 --> 25:44.002
You should either
stay out there

25:44.168 --> 25:46.296
or be here and try
to make it up with him.

25:46.462 --> 25:48.047
Gordon, it's very complicated.

25:48.214 --> 25:49.090
Do you still love him?

25:52.427 --> 25:53.970
Yes, I do.

25:54.137 --> 25:55.972
Then I don't see
why it's complicated.

26:04.105 --> 26:05.732
(Gio speaking Italian)

26:07.692 --> 26:09.444
This is it for us.

26:09.611 --> 26:11.154
Finished.

26:11.321 --> 26:12.864
If there's a war,

26:13.031 --> 26:15.033
you think anyone
will want to eat our food?

26:15.199 --> 26:18.119
More like they put us
in front of a firing squad.

26:18.286 --> 26:19.370
It's not our fault.

26:19.537 --> 26:20.413
VICTOR: You've been here
30 years, Uncle Gio.

26:20.580 --> 26:22.415
Me and Franco
were born here.

26:22.582 --> 26:25.043
I'm as English
as the next man.

26:25.209 --> 26:26.836
In war, everything will change.

26:29.172 --> 26:30.715
(sobbing)

26:30.882 --> 26:32.258
Gabriella?

26:35.428 --> 26:37.430
Now look what
you've gone and done.

26:42.810 --> 26:44.729
(sobbing)

26:53.863 --> 26:56.407
Don't take
any notice of him.

26:56.574 --> 26:58.660
He always thinks
the worst.

26:58.826 --> 26:59.911
He's right.

27:00.078 --> 27:01.663
They will come for me.

27:01.829 --> 27:03.331
Hey…

27:03.498 --> 27:05.333
No one's going
to come for you.

27:05.500 --> 27:06.626
Oh, Victor…

27:06.793 --> 27:09.921
If there is a war,
will you look after me?

27:10.088 --> 27:12.131
Of course I will.

27:28.231 --> 27:31.693
I was not sure
you liked me, but now…

27:40.660 --> 27:42.745
I don't think we've met
since that crazy tango night.

27:44.872 --> 27:47.083
Yes, well,
I've been indisposed.

27:49.085 --> 27:50.336
Are you better now?

27:51.421 --> 27:52.630
Yes, I am.

27:54.632 --> 27:57.301
But I do have
a favor to ask.

27:57.468 --> 28:00.263
I need a reliable locksmith
to come to the house,

28:00.430 --> 28:02.015
and I was hoping you could
organize a Selfridge man.

28:02.181 --> 28:03.349
Of course.

28:03.516 --> 28:06.519
This evening,
while the Lords is in session.

28:06.686 --> 28:08.312
Loxley, he hates disturbances,

28:08.479 --> 28:10.606
so it's best to do the work
when he's not there.

28:10.773 --> 28:13.317
I will arrange it,
it's no trouble.

28:13.484 --> 28:15.236
Thank you.

28:15.403 --> 28:19.073
How is it, having Lord Loxley
back in London?

28:19.240 --> 28:23.036
We're like ships
that pass in the night.

28:23.202 --> 28:27.331
I was just wondering,

28:27.498 --> 28:29.751
are you having
any financial problems?

28:29.917 --> 28:31.544
He closed your account,

28:31.711 --> 28:34.589
and I haven't seen you
in the shop in weeks.

28:34.756 --> 28:38.509
Loxley hates to part
with his money, that's all.

28:38.676 --> 28:40.470
So when he's in town,
I have to behave.

28:40.636 --> 28:42.930
Nothing more than that?

28:43.097 --> 28:44.265
No, nothing more than that.

28:45.892 --> 28:48.311
He's asked me for a list
of leather manufacturers

28:48.478 --> 28:49.520
for military boots,

28:49.687 --> 28:51.981
and I'd prefer
to take that information

28:52.148 --> 28:55.902
to the Procurement
Committee myself.

28:56.069 --> 28:57.945
But they won't open their doors
to you, Harry.

28:58.112 --> 29:01.324
In a crisis, the establishment
stick together.

29:01.491 --> 29:03.284
Can I trust Lord Loxley?

29:05.703 --> 29:08.247
You can trust Loxley.

29:08.414 --> 29:10.416
I promise you.

29:10.583 --> 29:11.876
That's all I need to know.

29:12.043 --> 29:14.170
You tell him that
I'll run up a list for him

29:14.337 --> 29:15.671
in the next couple of days.

29:23.387 --> 29:24.514
Good day, Miss Hawkins.

29:26.724 --> 29:28.643
Come to see Mr. Selfridge,
Mr. Edwards?

29:28.810 --> 29:30.269
No, I've come
to see you.

29:30.436 --> 29:31.979
I'd like to take you out.

29:32.146 --> 29:34.065
We tried that, remember?

29:34.232 --> 29:35.316
It wasn't a success.

29:35.483 --> 29:36.567
I was a fool.

29:36.734 --> 29:38.277
Give me another chance.

29:42.657 --> 29:44.033
Maybe.

29:44.200 --> 29:45.493
Just as long as it's
somewhere nice.

29:45.660 --> 29:47.203
Excellent.

29:47.370 --> 29:49.622
The bank holiday's
set to be fine.

29:49.789 --> 29:52.250
I'll meet you outside Green Park
underground station at 11:00.

29:54.377 --> 29:55.711
Till then.

29:59.465 --> 30:01.008
HENRI: You know what
you've forgotten?

30:01.175 --> 30:02.760
The heart of the empire.

30:02.927 --> 30:04.637
It can't be…

30:04.804 --> 30:07.765
Great Britain.

30:07.932 --> 30:09.934
Oh, of course.

30:10.101 --> 30:12.270
Now you say it,
it's seems so obvious.

30:12.436 --> 30:13.563
As they enter,

30:13.729 --> 30:15.022
the customer would see
the British ﬂag.

30:15.189 --> 30:17.275
AGNES: Maybe a
statue of Britannia?

30:17.441 --> 30:19.360
Excellent!

30:20.862 --> 30:22.321
Miss Hawkins.

30:22.488 --> 30:24.282
Mr. Leclair.

30:24.448 --> 30:25.158
Will there be a band?

30:25.324 --> 30:26.284
Yes.

30:26.450 --> 30:28.661
They must play
British music.

30:28.828 --> 30:29.912
Mr. Leclair.

30:30.079 --> 30:32.039
Oh, Mr. Colleano.

30:33.249 --> 30:34.375
You're back.

30:34.542 --> 30:36.002
I'm just here to help

30:36.169 --> 30:38.921
with the Empire
celebration.

30:39.088 --> 30:40.173
Very good.

30:42.008 --> 30:44.468
And what about Accessories,
Mr. Leclair, Miss Towler?

30:44.635 --> 30:47.305
Well, this is the heart
of the store,

30:47.471 --> 30:49.182
so with your permission,
Miss Mardle,

30:49.348 --> 30:51.267
the Britannia
will stand right here.

30:51.434 --> 30:53.352
Wonderful.

30:58.065 --> 31:00.860
Who is that gentleman,
Mr. Colleano?

31:02.236 --> 31:03.779
Henri Leclair.

31:03.946 --> 31:06.157
Oh.

31:06.324 --> 31:08.159
So that's Leclair.

31:08.326 --> 31:10.453
I didn't imagine
he'd look like that.

31:10.620 --> 31:12.830
What do you mean?

31:12.997 --> 31:14.498
He's rather shabby.

31:16.459 --> 31:18.336
Well, he can't just swan back
into the store

31:18.502 --> 31:20.796
and expect his job back.

31:20.963 --> 31:23.216
Looks like he just has.

31:36.812 --> 31:38.689
(doorknob jamming)

31:39.690 --> 31:40.775
Mae?

31:43.569 --> 31:44.946
Let me in.

31:48.449 --> 31:52.703
I've been vouching for you
around town, Loxley.

31:52.870 --> 31:55.373
But if you ever
come near me again,

31:55.539 --> 31:59.835
I'll tell the whole world
you're a bankrupt.

32:00.002 --> 32:02.171
Do you hear me?

32:02.338 --> 32:06.676
I'll scream it
from the rooftops.

32:06.842 --> 32:07.927
Understand?

32:35.705 --> 32:37.665
What time is it?

32:37.832 --> 32:39.250
It's 9:00.

32:39.417 --> 32:40.251
9:00?

32:40.418 --> 32:42.044
Why aren't you at work?

32:42.211 --> 32:43.838
It's a bank holiday,
remember?

32:44.005 --> 32:44.922
Oh.

32:45.089 --> 32:46.173
Of course.

32:48.551 --> 32:49.427
Thank you.

32:49.593 --> 32:51.137
We need to talk.

32:53.222 --> 32:56.309
The news from Europe is
getting worse.

32:56.475 --> 33:00.980
The French have mobilized troops
along the German border.

33:01.147 --> 33:02.565
I was thinking…

33:02.732 --> 33:06.527
Perhaps you should
go back to America.

33:06.694 --> 33:08.654
What?

33:08.821 --> 33:10.239
What's the point
of you staying?

33:10.406 --> 33:12.283
You could be in danger,
and I don't want that.

33:12.450 --> 33:13.784
I will not run away
like a coward!

33:13.951 --> 33:16.495
Is that how you want people
to think of me?

33:16.662 --> 33:18.456
Of course not.

33:18.622 --> 33:21.792
I'm just trying to do
what's best for everyone.

33:24.086 --> 33:25.171
I'm sorry.

33:25.338 --> 33:26.964
I know I'm being difficult

33:27.131 --> 33:30.801
and you're just trying
to make things right between us.

33:30.968 --> 33:33.512
I don't know
how to get your trust back

33:33.679 --> 33:35.639
except to keep on trying.

33:35.806 --> 33:40.728
I don't know what's going
to happen if there's a war.

33:40.895 --> 33:45.191
I have the store to think about,
and my staff.

33:46.692 --> 33:49.362
Then let me help you.

33:49.528 --> 33:53.491
I can't leave now,
not when you need me.

33:53.657 --> 33:58.412
I won't let you stay
if it's about duty.

33:58.579 --> 34:00.873
It's not just about duty.

34:01.040 --> 34:02.875
Really?

34:06.379 --> 34:07.463
Really.

34:11.425 --> 34:13.719
Stay, then.

34:13.886 --> 34:17.556
And I promise,
I swear by everything,

34:17.723 --> 34:20.976
I won't let you down.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.271
Thank you.

34:24.438 --> 34:25.648
But right now…

34:27.565 --> 34:30.235
I want to spend the day
with my wife.

34:30.402 --> 34:33.072
We have a lot
to catch up on.

34:35.157 --> 34:36.574
So that was how
I got started:

34:36.742 --> 34:38.077
sweeping the floor
of the post room

34:38.244 --> 34:39.328
<i>of the Irish Times.</i>

34:39.495 --> 34:40.871
Imagine.

34:41.038 --> 34:45.083
Mr. Frank Edwards,
a broom pusher!

34:45.251 --> 34:46.418
A bit less
of the "Mister" then.

34:46.585 --> 34:47.585
You'd have thought my name was
"You there!"

34:47.753 --> 34:49.088
Oh, poor you.

34:49.255 --> 34:50.339
Bullied, were you?

34:50.505 --> 34:51.465
Terribly.

34:51.632 --> 34:53.509
How about you?

34:53.676 --> 34:56.344
How did you get started?

34:56.512 --> 34:59.598
My dad had a stall
at Borough market.

34:59.765 --> 35:02.309
Now I know why you can sell
anything to anyone.

35:04.186 --> 35:05.855
We're not so unalike,
you and me.

35:06.021 --> 35:09.066
Except I'm on the way up

35:09.233 --> 35:12.903
and you are holding on
by your fingertips.

35:13.070 --> 35:15.656
It's true, I need a scoop.

35:15.823 --> 35:17.992
Is that why you're always
hanging round Mr. Selfridge?

35:18.159 --> 35:20.494
He's good COPY-

35:20.661 --> 35:22.413
Well, don't expect me
to tip you off.

35:22.580 --> 35:23.831
Loyal, are you?

35:23.998 --> 35:25.082
Yes.

35:29.170 --> 35:30.796
Although I wish
he'd sent me to Paris.

35:30.963 --> 35:32.756
Oh, London's not so bad.

35:32.923 --> 35:35.176
Dining alfresco
in the sunshine.

35:36.802 --> 35:38.929
Another glass?

35:39.096 --> 35:41.682
Well, I suppose
it is a holiday.

35:44.477 --> 35:46.061
There we are.

35:47.980 --> 35:49.607
Your good health.

36:10.044 --> 36:11.086
Right.

36:18.469 --> 36:20.513
(yawning and sighing)

36:52.044 --> 36:53.128
Thank you.

36:53.295 --> 36:54.547
You have done a good job.

36:54.713 --> 36:55.798
Good evening.

37:00.928 --> 37:03.681
That I think is enough
for tonight.

37:06.308 --> 37:08.185
Now…

37:08.352 --> 37:11.564
I couldn't have done this
without you, so…

37:11.730 --> 37:13.732
What is it?

37:23.576 --> 37:26.078
I can't accept this.

37:26.245 --> 37:29.206
Well, you used to give me
presents all the time,

37:29.373 --> 37:32.001
so now it's my turn.

37:51.812 --> 37:53.188
Good morning, sir.

38:25.888 --> 38:27.389
Congratulations.

38:39.693 --> 38:41.070
This is truly incredible,
Miss Towler!

38:41.236 --> 38:42.321
Well done.

38:42.488 --> 38:45.115
Thank you.

38:45.282 --> 38:47.034
And Henri,

38:47.201 --> 38:49.161
it's wonderful
to have you back.

38:59.838 --> 39:01.799
Is Mr. Grove late again?

39:01.965 --> 39:03.175
I didn't see him
on the floor.

39:03.342 --> 39:04.802
He's in his office,
Mr. Selfridge.

39:04.968 --> 39:07.930
He's hardly left the building
for the last four days.

39:08.097 --> 39:09.682
You might want to…

39:16.480 --> 39:17.606
Come in.

39:17.773 --> 39:19.274
(door opens)

39:21.402 --> 39:23.153
Good morning,
Mr. Selfridge.

39:26.865 --> 39:31.370
This is quite a transformation,
Mr. Grove.

39:31.537 --> 39:33.288
Well, I've put some
new systems in place.

39:35.833 --> 39:37.042
Would you be
interested

39:37.209 --> 39:38.711
if I were
to show them to you?

39:38.877 --> 39:40.504
Go on.

39:40.671 --> 39:41.880
Right.

39:45.217 --> 39:46.593
Every member of staff
is now catalogued

39:46.760 --> 39:47.845
in this filing system.

39:50.931 --> 39:52.683
Each one has a card

39:52.850 --> 39:54.727
which I will keep
regularly updated.

39:57.229 --> 39:58.897
On it will be a record
of their past employment,

39:59.064 --> 40:00.941
their present position

40:01.108 --> 40:04.653
and any other pertinent
biographical facts.

40:06.655 --> 40:09.032
Efficiency and order.

40:09.199 --> 40:11.493
Exactly what we need.

40:14.163 --> 40:17.374
I've also begun an analysis
on staff age.

40:17.541 --> 40:18.751
It's highlighted
something.

40:23.046 --> 40:25.466
80% of our male staff

40:25.632 --> 40:27.718
are eligible
to join the Army.

40:34.600 --> 40:36.810
I'll keep this.

40:36.977 --> 40:38.896
Well done, Mr. Grove.

40:39.062 --> 40:40.564
Carry on the good work.

40:53.452 --> 40:55.954
(musicians tuning)

41:05.297 --> 41:07.090
It's lovely to meet you.

41:09.843 --> 41:11.345
Anything to say for the papers,
Mrs. Selfridge?

41:11.512 --> 41:13.180
Only that I'm very proud
of my husband.

41:13.347 --> 41:14.515
This is a wonderful
exhibition

41:14.681 --> 41:16.141
and I'm very much
looking forward

41:16.308 --> 41:17.601
to meeting Mr. Churchill.

41:17.768 --> 41:19.019
Harry!

41:21.355 --> 41:22.439
You made it.

41:22.606 --> 41:24.650
I wouldn't have missed this
for anything.

41:24.817 --> 41:27.444
And how wonderful to see you
in the store again, Henri.

41:27.611 --> 41:29.238
I behaved very badly
towards you.

41:29.404 --> 41:30.739
Am I forgiven?

41:30.906 --> 41:32.115
Of course you are.

41:34.034 --> 41:35.118
Excuse me.

41:36.578 --> 41:39.039
Harry, this is very
patriotic.

41:39.206 --> 41:42.167
You've captured the mood
of the nation, as you always do.

41:42.334 --> 41:43.418
Thank you so much.

41:45.087 --> 41:46.964
Lord Loxley, can I speak
to you for a moment?

41:49.550 --> 41:53.262
These are leather manufacturers
from all over Britain.

41:53.428 --> 41:55.556
I've listed them
in order of preference.

41:55.722 --> 41:57.140
These companies
are first rate.

41:57.307 --> 41:58.475
These, you stay clear of.

41:58.642 --> 42:00.769
These are shoddy
and not to be trusted.

42:00.936 --> 42:02.271
Thank you, Selfridge.

42:02.437 --> 42:05.524
This is just what I needed.

42:05.691 --> 42:07.776
Let me know
how you get on with it.

42:07.943 --> 42:09.027
Will do.

42:18.453 --> 42:21.164
REPORTER: What's happening, Mr.
Crabb?

42:21.331 --> 42:22.624
Any news?

42:33.051 --> 42:35.304
Are we going to be here
all day, Mr. Selfridge?

42:38.640 --> 42:40.392
Any idea what's happening?

42:47.649 --> 42:49.526
Mr. Churchill
will be here soon.

42:49.693 --> 42:51.987
(elevator bell rings)

43:03.624 --> 43:05.709
(whispering)

43:24.144 --> 43:25.228
(clears throat)

43:26.897 --> 43:28.732
Ladies and gentlemen,

43:28.899 --> 43:31.944
Mr. Churchill
won't be coming in today.

43:32.110 --> 43:35.822
(staff sighs
with disappointment)

43:35.989 --> 43:39.952
Germany has declared war
on France and invaded Belgium.

43:40.118 --> 43:41.203
(staff murmuring)

43:59.429 --> 44:01.807
The great
British Empire…

44:01.974 --> 44:06.061
This map will not look the same,
I think, for much longer.

44:06.228 --> 44:07.980
You may be right.

44:10.023 --> 44:11.650
Come on.

44:11.817 --> 44:13.276
Time for a drink.

44:23.078 --> 44:25.163
Mr. Selfridge.

44:25.330 --> 44:26.415
Mr. Leclair, welcome.

44:26.581 --> 44:27.666
Thank you.

44:28.875 --> 44:31.336
SELFRIDGE:
Miss Day,

44:31.503 --> 44:33.130
I hear Rose has been
talking to you

44:33.296 --> 44:34.423
about going
into business.

44:35.674 --> 44:37.175
Oh, the club.

44:37.342 --> 44:40.345
No, I couldn't take
Rose's money.

44:40.512 --> 44:41.847
I appreciate that.

44:42.014 --> 44:45.809
You're not at all
as I expected, Miss Day.

44:45.976 --> 44:47.728
I'm not sure
whether to take that

44:47.894 --> 44:49.146
as a compliment or not.

44:49.312 --> 44:50.564
Well, you should--
it was meant as one.

44:50.731 --> 44:51.815
We should start again.

44:51.982 --> 44:54.192
As friends.

44:54.359 --> 44:56.486
That's a lovely idea.

45:04.536 --> 45:06.329
To my Creative Director.

45:06.496 --> 45:09.082
No, Harry, it can't be
like it was before.

45:09.249 --> 45:10.375
Why not?

45:10.542 --> 45:11.960
I'll give you an overview
of the whole store.

45:12.127 --> 45:13.378
We can work together
like we used to.

45:13.545 --> 45:16.339
I said I would just stay
for the exhibition.

45:16.506 --> 45:18.258
I have other business
to settle in London.

45:18.425 --> 45:20.302
SELFRIDGE:
Like what?

45:20.469 --> 45:21.595
Trust me.

45:21.762 --> 45:23.263
It wouldn't be good
for you or me if I stayed.

45:23.430 --> 45:24.598
