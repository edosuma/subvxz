00:01.001 --> 00:03.304
(MUSIC PLAYING)

00:03.371 --> 00:05.639
I'm just saying, every time
you order a beet salad,

00:05.706 --> 00:06.874
you don't have to ask
the waiter,

00:06.940 --> 00:09.277
"Excuse me.
Are these beets by Dre?"

00:09.343 --> 00:10.678
I know I don't have to,

00:10.744 --> 00:13.514
but a good comedian
goes the extra mile.

00:13.581 --> 00:15.849
Listen.
What?

00:15.916 --> 00:18.252
This is what 3:00
sounds like.

00:18.319 --> 00:19.553
So peaceful.

00:19.620 --> 00:24.392
So, half day,
house to ourselves.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.294
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

00:26.360 --> 00:29.230
We are gonna nap
so hard right now.

00:29.297 --> 00:31.332
(BOTH LAUGH)
I call little spoon.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.334
You don't have to call it
anymore. It's assumed.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.971
Ah!
This place is a mess.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.273
Does your dad have
to leave his socks

00:39.340 --> 00:41.041
hanging on the couch?

00:41.109 --> 00:43.177
Enough of your rules,
Allison.

00:43.244 --> 00:45.246
He can't leave his socks
on the couch.

00:45.313 --> 00:47.748
He can't nap in our bed.

00:47.815 --> 00:50.184
Has there been any talk
of an end to his "visit"?

00:50.251 --> 00:52.086
I thought you were in
a good place with my dad.

00:52.153 --> 00:54.088
Don't get me wrong.
I, I love him,

00:54.155 --> 00:55.489
and he saved Thanksgiving,

00:55.556 --> 00:58.126
but just because you're in
a good place with lasagna

00:58.192 --> 00:59.993
doesn't mean you want
to eat it every night.

01:00.994 --> 01:02.496
Well, not your lasagna.

01:04.165 --> 01:06.066
Oh, come on!
His shoes?

01:06.134 --> 01:08.236
What's with him?

01:08.302 --> 01:12.706
(SCOFFS) You're one to talk,
leaving your bra lying around.

01:14.475 --> 01:16.110
That's not my bra.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.412
Oh, hey.

01:18.479 --> 01:20.314
You two are supposed to be
at work.

01:20.381 --> 01:22.950
Hey, where'd...
Oh, hello.

01:25.052 --> 01:27.488
Uh, this is Linda.

01:27.555 --> 01:30.524
Linda, Ken, Allison.

01:30.591 --> 01:33.093
Uh, hi.
It's nice to meet you.
(STAMMERS)

01:33.161 --> 01:35.363
Nope. I'm a hugger.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.298
Oh.
(CHUCKLES)

01:38.966 --> 01:41.435
I got a pretty solid lead
on that bra mystery.

01:42.903 --> 01:44.572

01:50.110 --> 01:51.145
(DOOR CLOSES)

01:53.314 --> 01:55.316
(SINGSONG VOICE)
Busted.

01:56.950 --> 02:00.221
Dad, um,
can we talk about this?

02:00.288 --> 02:01.955
You know,
I'm just gonna...

02:02.022 --> 02:05.426
You... I need to...
No... No excuse.

02:05.493 --> 02:08.028
Sorry. I didn't think
anybody was home.

02:08.095 --> 02:10.764
Next time,
we'll hang out at Linda's.

02:10.831 --> 02:14.302
Is she that Realtor
you were with at
The Cheesecake Factory?

02:14.368 --> 02:15.603
Yeah.
She's my girlfriend.

02:15.669 --> 02:17.538
Girlfriend? Since when?

02:17.605 --> 02:20.007
Uh, five weeks ago,
closed on condo,

02:20.073 --> 02:23.311
three weeks ago,
closed on Linda.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.413
Great. I'm glad you're
getting out there, but, uh...

02:25.479 --> 02:26.980
Look, all I'm saying
is just, you know,

02:27.047 --> 02:29.283
show some consideration.
That's all.

02:29.350 --> 02:32.386
Okay, I got it, Dad.

02:32.453 --> 02:34.855
Yeah. Oh, clever,
'cause you're my dad.

02:34.922 --> 02:36.657
(CHUCKLES)

02:36.724 --> 02:39.327
But what do you say
we shut down the sex grotto?

02:39.393 --> 02:42.095
Or you can stay
out of my business.

02:42.162 --> 02:46.934
Whoa, Dad, I'm not trying
to upset you, but, um... Okay.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.003
If you're gonna go there,
uh, you're in my house,

02:50.070 --> 02:52.440
so, actually,
it is my business.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.475
Oh. Is that how it is?

02:54.542 --> 02:57.245
Oh, I didn't...
that you were still... I...

02:59.513 --> 03:00.748
(MUSIC PLAYING)

03:08.155 --> 03:10.090
I'm telling you, Allison,
something's off with my dad.

03:10.157 --> 03:12.793
Oh. I know what you mean.
He hasn't been
himself lately.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.763
But that doesn't make it okay
that we walk into the house

03:15.829 --> 03:17.265
and find him
in the middle of...

03:18.966 --> 03:20.434
Go ahead.
In the middle of what?

03:20.501 --> 03:23.604
Uh... (CLEARS THROAT)
...entertaining
a lady friend.

03:23.671 --> 03:25.072
BOTH: Ooh!

03:25.138 --> 03:28.008
You got to back
this story up.

03:28.075 --> 03:29.743
No, actually,
I was talking to Ken.

03:29.810 --> 03:31.345
Yeah, guys,
this is kind of personal.

03:31.412 --> 03:33.247
I'll fill you in
over lunch.

03:34.382 --> 03:36.083
(CELLPHONE DINGS)

03:36.149 --> 03:37.385
(GASPS) Oh, my God.

03:37.451 --> 03:38.919
Molly wants to hang out
tomorrow.

03:38.986 --> 03:40.721
She never does that
anymore.

03:40.788 --> 03:42.990
(GASPS)
I know what this is.

03:43.056 --> 03:46.560
She needs her Mama Bear.
Ah. Classic cub call.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.829
Well, I know you
like being needed.

03:48.896 --> 03:49.897
I mean,
that's why you married me.

03:49.963 --> 03:51.198
(CHUCKLES)

03:51.265 --> 03:53.401
You know what?
I'm gonna make
this special.

03:53.467 --> 03:54.602
We're gonna have
a spa day.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.637
(GASPS) Ooh!
Who's gonna have a spa day?

03:56.704 --> 03:58.939
Oh, just me and Mo...
Just, uh...
Just Allison and Molly. Yeah.

03:59.006 --> 04:01.174
But fun. Which spa?

04:01.241 --> 04:02.876
I don't know.
Burke Williams.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.912
Ooh.
What are you gonna get?
A facial, a massage?

04:04.978 --> 04:06.314
Maybe a little manicure?

04:06.380 --> 04:08.782
Hey, you do dishes
for a family of five

04:08.849 --> 04:10.851
and try and keep
a top coat on for more
than three days, okay?

04:10.918 --> 04:13.921
You are so right.
That's on us for sure.

04:13.987 --> 04:16.189
She does not do dishes
for a family of five.

04:16.256 --> 04:20.227
Please. They order in
like every night.

04:20.294 --> 04:24.332
Hey, any chance "Papa Bear"
gets in on that spa action?

04:24.398 --> 04:25.733
You can't.
You're taking Dave

04:25.799 --> 04:27.335
to the Glendale Jazz Festival,
remember?

04:27.401 --> 04:29.036
DR. KEN: Ah, right.

04:29.102 --> 04:33.006
Jazz. Rock 'n' roll's
comatose little brother.

04:33.073 --> 04:35.576
Hey, Ken, I couldn't help
but overhear

04:35.643 --> 04:37.511
that you're, uh, going
to the Glendale Jazz Festival.

04:37.578 --> 04:38.812
Yeah.

04:38.879 --> 04:41.682
Ah, well, slap my knee
and call me Kathy. Me, too.

04:41.749 --> 04:44.885
"Kathy"?

04:44.952 --> 04:46.387
You actually like jazz?

04:46.454 --> 04:48.789
Oh, yeah. Jazz and I
have a lot in common...

04:48.856 --> 04:52.125
aimless,
more loved
in another era,

04:52.192 --> 04:55.128
best enjoyed by drunk people
in New Orleans.

04:55.195 --> 04:56.364
Well, I'll see you
at the concert.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.432
(SCATTING)

04:59.500 --> 05:00.501
(MUSIC PLAYING)

05:03.604 --> 05:06.640
So, what is it
you wanted
to talk about?

05:06.707 --> 05:09.343
Nothing.
I just wanted to hang out.

05:09.410 --> 05:11.745
Come on.
It's Mama Bear.

05:11.812 --> 05:15.082
We're in the safe cave.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.418
Well, I'm a little unnerved
by whatever that was.

05:18.719 --> 05:19.953
Okay.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.089
Well, if anything comes up,
just let me know.

05:22.155 --> 05:25.125
This is our day,
just you and me.

05:25.192 --> 05:28.061
(GIGGLES)

05:28.128 --> 05:30.831
Hey, ladies.
Where's the party?

05:32.299 --> 05:35.302
What are you guys
doing here?

05:35.369 --> 05:37.170
Okay, okay, so, you mentioned
a spa day yesterday.
Mm-hmm.

05:37.237 --> 05:39.172
And you know that thing where
somebody says, "Banana,"

05:39.239 --> 05:40.974
and then somebody else says,
"Banana," and you just...

05:41.041 --> 05:43.711
you think to yourself,
"Oh, my God, I want a banana"?

05:43.777 --> 05:44.812
Well, that happened.

05:46.213 --> 05:48.215
He's drunk.
We both are, but just...

05:48.281 --> 05:49.950
No, just a little bit.
Just, like, brunch drunk.

Whoo! Whoo!

06:00.528 --> 06:02.563
All right, Dave,
let's go, buddy.

06:02.630 --> 06:04.698
(MUSIC RESUMES)

06:06.233 --> 06:08.769
Each one of these guys
gets a solo?

06:08.836 --> 06:10.938
I've got to be back at work
next week.

06:11.004 --> 06:14.074
Dad, I feel like jazz
might not be your thing.

06:14.141 --> 06:15.242
What? No.

06:15.308 --> 06:17.210
(CHUCKLING)
Who needs structure?

06:17.277 --> 06:20.914
Run free, music! Run free!

06:20.981 --> 06:23.350
If you want to go,
maybe Pat can take me home.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.152
Oh, no, I couldn't do that.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.353
I wouldn't mind,

06:26.420 --> 06:28.355
'cause you're kind of
harshing our jazz buzz

06:28.422 --> 06:30.323
with your downer vibes.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.825
I don't know.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.594
I feel like
I should stick around.

06:33.661 --> 06:35.763
Oh, even the bass
gets a solo?

06:35.829 --> 06:37.164
Have fun, guys.

06:48.876 --> 06:50.177
So...

06:51.712 --> 06:53.747
Being a kid...

06:53.814 --> 06:55.516
How's that going?

06:55.583 --> 06:57.417
We can just listen
to the music.

06:57.485 --> 06:58.786
Excellent.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.388
(MUSIC PLAYING)

07:05.659 --> 07:06.960
Dad, what are you doing?

07:07.027 --> 07:08.696
Moving out.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.631
Linda and I decided
to live together.

07:10.698 --> 07:12.700
After three weeks?

07:12.766 --> 07:14.034
What do you even know
about this woman?

07:14.101 --> 07:15.503
I don't know.

07:15.569 --> 07:19.773
She's pretty.
Oh, and she likes mermaids.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.409
Okay, so, you're moving in
with someone you barely know?

07:22.476 --> 07:25.679
I know she said she'd
love to have me,
unlike some people.

07:25.746 --> 07:26.880
What?

07:26.947 --> 07:29.416
You said the other day,
"This is my house."

07:29.483 --> 07:30.518
You're right.

07:30.584 --> 07:31.619
You and Allison
don't want me.

07:31.685 --> 07:32.720
I'm a burden.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.422
Okay, calm down, Dad.
That's not true.

07:35.489 --> 07:37.758
Oh, yeah?
I heard you talking about me.

07:37.825 --> 07:39.059
"When is he gonna leave?"

07:39.893 --> 07:40.894
Huh?

07:40.961 --> 07:43.597
Son, I get it.

07:43.664 --> 07:45.365
I'm not the easiest guy
to have around.

07:45.432 --> 07:47.935
I butt in, have card games
without asking.

07:48.001 --> 07:50.070
I get on
everybody's nerves.

07:50.137 --> 07:53.607
You'll be happier
without me.

07:53.674 --> 07:56.544
This isn't like you, Dad.
What's wrong?

07:56.610 --> 07:58.879
Nothing's wrong.
What's wrong with you?

08:00.581 --> 08:04.217
Look, we... (SIGHS)
We do want you here.

08:04.284 --> 08:06.486
It's just a boundary issue.
That's all.

08:06.554 --> 08:08.556
No boundary issues
if I'm not here.

08:08.622 --> 08:09.857
Problem solved.

08:13.026 --> 08:15.095
But Dad,
can I just say one thing?

08:15.162 --> 08:18.465
What?
You packed our remote.

08:18.532 --> 08:20.568
I know. It's universal.
Linda's is broken.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.335
I don't pack randomly.

all eager,

too, and I also adopted.

My son's with his grandma
right now,

09:07.581 --> 09:08.716

you were wondering,

"What's Megan doing alone
at a jazz festival

09:10.851 --> 09:12.886
"talking to a cute guy
and his son?"

09:14.588 --> 09:16.924
Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

I assumed that
you were adopted
and you were his father.

I thought
we were in the same boat.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.033
Well, ahoy...

09:26.099 --> 09:29.970
...is my nautical way
of saying he is
definitely my son.

Ah.
May I have a word
with you, Dad?

09:36.209 --> 09:37.244
Sure.

09:37.310 --> 09:40.447
Uh, well, uh,
permission to go ashore?

09:40.513 --> 09:42.215
Uh, granted.

What?

09:49.089 --> 09:50.357
What was that?

09:50.423 --> 09:51.925
What? Look, I panicked,
all right?

09:51.992 --> 09:53.861
I thought it would
make her like me,

09:53.927 --> 09:55.996
and I think I like her,
so could you just play along?

09:56.063 --> 09:58.565
(SIGHS) Fine.
I'll be your wing-boy.

09:58.632 --> 09:59.733
Ah, great.

09:59.800 --> 10:03.336
Ooh.
(LAUGHS) Grr!

10:03.403 --> 10:05.305
But please,
no more noogies.

10:05.372 --> 10:06.840
Don't talk back
to your dad.

10:07.540 --> 10:08.541
(MUSIC PLAYING)

10:10.010 --> 10:12.412
Would you like
a callous remover?
I'm good.

10:12.479 --> 10:16.116
No. She needs it.
Sand them, Vivian.

10:20.087 --> 10:22.189
Well, another
boundary trampled.

10:22.255 --> 10:25.425
Remind me to invite them
to my next mammogram.

10:25.492 --> 10:27.260
I thought you liked
Clark and Damona.

10:27.327 --> 10:28.461
That's not the point.

10:28.528 --> 10:30.430
At work, anytime
something personal comes up,

10:30.497 --> 10:31.699
it's like
we're on a talk show...

10:31.765 --> 10:33.834
and not even a one-on-one,
like with Ellen.

10:33.901 --> 10:35.836
They're a frickin' panel.

10:35.903 --> 10:37.404
Well,
think of it this way...

10:37.470 --> 10:39.472
you're new, and
they're trying to show
you they like you.

10:39.539 --> 10:42.075
It's like when a cat
brings you a dead mouse,

10:42.142 --> 10:43.343
except instead of
a dead mouse,

10:43.410 --> 10:44.878
it's unsolicited advice
about your feet.

10:44.945 --> 10:47.214
Although,
he wasn't wrong.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.384
But if you accept
the dead mouse

10:51.451 --> 10:52.753
instead of always
putting up walls,

10:52.820 --> 10:54.387
they'll know
you like them, too.

10:56.589 --> 10:57.991
You're pretty insightful.

10:58.058 --> 10:59.993
I am my mother's daughter.

11:00.060 --> 11:01.729
So what else you got?

11:01.795 --> 11:03.363
I'm in the zone.
Hit me.

11:03.430 --> 11:06.066
No, no, no, no.
We're here to relax.

11:06.700 --> 11:07.701
Okay.

11:09.569 --> 11:10.738
(BOTH SIGH)

11:10.804 --> 11:12.740
Okay, since I moved
to the HMO,

11:12.806 --> 11:15.442
I feel like I'm stuck
in this giant bureaucracy.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.910
Instead of spending
more time with patients,

11:16.977 --> 11:19.512
I have to go to meetings,
constant meetings.

11:19.579 --> 11:20.948
Need a vacation day?
Meeting.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.182
Out of toilet paper?
Meeting.

11:22.249 --> 11:24.251
Need to schedule a meeting?
Meeting.

11:24.317 --> 11:27.287
I had to be in early Monday
for a meeting meeting!

11:27.354 --> 11:29.356
And on top of that...
(LAUGHS)

11:29.422 --> 11:32.492
Yo, we just took another
couple's couples massage.

11:32.559 --> 11:35.595
Yeah, so, if anyone asks,
we're the Del Toros.

11:35.662 --> 11:36.897
(MUSIC PLAYING)

11:39.232 --> 11:41.668
Hey, Allison,
I didn't want to bother you,

11:41.735 --> 11:44.404
but Clark and Damona aren't
available for some reason.

11:44.471 --> 11:47.174
Anyway, my dad and I
got into a thing

11:47.240 --> 11:49.843
and it escalated
and he moved out

11:49.910 --> 11:53.713
and went to live with that...
that Realtor.

11:55.248 --> 11:56.850
I don't know
what his deal is.

11:56.917 --> 11:59.019
Even worse,
he made off with our remote.

11:59.086 --> 12:02.255
Yeah. I tried to
distract myself
by watching TV,

12:02.322 --> 12:04.691
but I had to get up like five
times to change the channel,

12:04.758 --> 12:07.327
and... and my hammies
are on fire.

12:07.394 --> 12:08.528
I don't know what to do.

12:10.397 --> 12:11.965
Wait. I do know
what to do.

12:12.032 --> 12:13.633
I got to get him back.

12:13.700 --> 12:15.168
I also got try to get
my remote back, too,

12:15.235 --> 12:16.503
but no promises.
Got to pick my battles.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.238
Oh, and we're out of yogurt.
Love you. Bye.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.611
(JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)

12:26.179 --> 12:28.748
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

12:28.816 --> 12:30.183
That was something.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.853
Wow. Well, it was great
getting to know you.

12:32.920 --> 12:36.423
Oh, hey, uh, why
don't we stick around,
order some dinner?

12:36.489 --> 12:37.958
Oh, I'd love to.

12:38.025 --> 12:39.392
You sure
you guys don't have plans?

12:39.459 --> 12:42.295
No, no, no.
Um, Dave's game got canceled.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.131
Did it ever.

12:44.197 --> 12:45.532
Great. I'd love to.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.667
Let me just check in
with my son first.
(CHUCKLES)

12:47.734 --> 12:49.402
That sounds like something
I'd do.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.471
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

12:52.272 --> 12:54.041
Oh, boy.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.475
Seriously? Dinner?

12:55.542 --> 12:56.810
Oh, come on, Dave.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.846
It's not every day
that a pretty woman
at a jazz festival

12:58.912 --> 13:01.581
likes me for having
an adopted Asian child.

13:01.648 --> 13:03.884
But how are we gonna
pull this off?

13:03.951 --> 13:07.187
It'll be just like jazz.
We improvise.

13:07.254 --> 13:09.589
And then at a certain point,
you're gonna go home, and...

13:09.656 --> 13:11.091
And I'm gonna do my solo.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.662
Fine, but I just have to text
my dad to make sure it's okay.

13:15.728 --> 13:18.231
All right.
Remind him I'm his boss.

13:19.867 --> 13:22.702
(SIGHS) Hey.
Hey. (CHUCKLES)

13:22.769 --> 13:23.803
So, Dave,
your game got canceled.

13:23.871 --> 13:24.905
What sport
are you playing?

13:24.972 --> 13:26.874
Uh, Little League.
Mm-hmm.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.341
Oh, Jesse plays
Little League, too,

13:28.408 --> 13:30.577
but, you know,
during baseball season.

13:32.279 --> 13:33.947
Yeah, well,
he meant Little League...

13:34.014 --> 13:35.682
Fencing.
...fencing!

13:35.748 --> 13:37.650
There's a fencing league?

13:37.717 --> 13:40.820
It's little.
Yeah.
Thus, little league.

13:42.655 --> 13:43.656
Am I right?

13:43.723 --> 13:45.092
(CHUCKLES)

13:47.995 --> 13:50.931
The parking is ridiculous,
the elevators are slow...

13:50.998 --> 13:53.166
thank you...
and in the cafeteria,

13:53.233 --> 13:54.834
they write "tacos"
with an apostrophe

13:54.902 --> 13:58.605
like there's someone named
Taco and something
belongs to him.

14:00.073 --> 14:01.841
It's okay, Mom.
I get it.

14:01.909 --> 14:04.411
All but one of those things
seem really hard.

14:04.477 --> 14:06.379
I guess I'm just wondering

14:06.446 --> 14:08.681
if joining the HMO
was the right move.

14:08.748 --> 14:11.151
Are you kidding?
It was definitely
the right thing.

14:11.218 --> 14:12.285
Really?

14:12.352 --> 14:13.586
Yeah. When you were
in private practice,

14:13.653 --> 14:15.788
we never got to see you.
You were always on call.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.992
Now, when you're off,
you're off, like today,

14:19.059 --> 14:20.327
and we get to spend it
together.

14:20.393 --> 14:23.730
I'm going to college soon,
and I'll miss this.

14:23.796 --> 14:26.099
Oh, honey.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.835
My little cub
has become a mama bear.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.337
(CHUCKLES)

14:30.403 --> 14:31.804
Mm.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.241
I can't find my slipper.

14:37.344 --> 14:38.878
What's happening here?

14:38.946 --> 14:40.981
Oh, we're not...

14:41.048 --> 14:42.515
You know what, Clark?

14:42.582 --> 14:44.684
My amazing daughter
was helping me realize

14:44.751 --> 14:46.119
that, by moving to the HMO,

14:46.186 --> 14:48.588
she and I can spend more
quality time together.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.257
Yeah, I feel like
that's something

14:50.323 --> 14:51.925
you guys should keep
between you.

14:54.127 --> 14:55.162
We have a situation.
What?

14:55.228 --> 14:56.896
The actual Del Toros
showed up.

14:56.964 --> 14:59.632
(GASPS)
Girls, bye.

14:59.699 --> 15:01.368
(MUSIC PLAYING)

15:01.434 --> 15:02.835
(LAUGHS)

15:10.843 --> 15:12.912
Ken.

15:12.980 --> 15:13.981
What are you doing here?

15:14.047 --> 15:15.915
I need to talk to you.

15:15.983 --> 15:17.350
Are you alone?

15:17.417 --> 15:21.254
Yeah, Linda's showing a house
in Tarzana, priced to sell.

15:21.321 --> 15:23.156
Should be multiple offers.

15:31.331 --> 15:32.432
Damn.

15:32.499 --> 15:35.168
She really does
like mermaids.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.239
Look, I'm sorry
we hurt your feelings.

15:39.306 --> 15:40.307
That's on us.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.642
We weren't trying
to push you away.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.477
I mean, you're a big part
of our lives.

15:44.544 --> 15:47.147
You helped Dave
adjust to middle school.

15:47.214 --> 15:48.982
You were a hero
on Thanksgiving.

15:49.049 --> 15:51.118
And you're Molly and Dave's
favorite grandparent.

15:51.184 --> 15:52.519
You're by no means
a burden.

15:52.585 --> 15:56.389
So, please...come back?

16:01.828 --> 16:03.596
I don't know.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.737
You've been
really sensitive

16:10.803 --> 16:13.040
and irritable
and all over the place.

16:13.106 --> 16:14.141
What's going on?

16:18.645 --> 16:22.449
I'm in my 70s,
living in my
son's guest room.

16:22.515 --> 16:26.153
It's not where I thought
I'd be at this
point in my life.

16:26.219 --> 16:31.558
I'm independent guy,
not some feeble old man.

16:33.060 --> 16:34.761
I know what this is.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.664
I've seen it before
in some of my patients.

16:37.730 --> 16:41.268
You're having what's called
a later-life crisis.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.403
Crisis?
No. I don't have crisis.

16:43.470 --> 16:47.607
No. It's just a term.
It's common
as people get older.

16:47.674 --> 16:50.810
You're a little lost,
lonely.

16:50.877 --> 16:52.612
You're feeling the loss
of your marriage.

16:54.914 --> 16:58.218
I know things weren't perfect
with your mother,

16:58.285 --> 17:03.590
but at least with her...
I knew who I was.

17:05.658 --> 17:08.128
I don't like
feeling this way.

17:08.195 --> 17:09.429
It's not fun.

17:09.496 --> 17:13.233
I know, but
you're gonna get through it,

17:13.300 --> 17:15.435
and you'll find yourself
again.

17:15.502 --> 17:20.607
And in the meanwhile,
why not do it with us...

17:20.673 --> 17:23.876
and, most importantly,
with me?

17:23.943 --> 17:26.579
What about you guys
complaining about me?

17:26.646 --> 17:29.082
Hey, if people
who got complained about

17:29.149 --> 17:31.918
weren't allowed in
the house, I'd be the
first one on the curb.

17:32.985 --> 17:35.988
(BOTH LAUGH)

17:37.957 --> 17:38.958
Let's go home.

17:39.025 --> 17:40.693
Yes, sir.

17:41.761 --> 17:43.796
Besides, this place
is terrible.

17:43.863 --> 17:46.499
Mermaids everywhere,
but no Wi-Fi.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.535
I ain't got time for that.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.603
And Linda's gonna be okay
with you leaving?

17:50.670 --> 17:52.872
Yeah.
I play hard to get.

17:52.939 --> 17:55.475
Makes her crazy.

17:55.542 --> 17:57.076
Uh, crazier.

17:57.144 --> 17:59.146
(LAUGHS)

18:00.480 --> 18:02.482
Oh, let me.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.726
Thanks.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.962
So, how old was Dave
when he came to live with you?

18:16.028 --> 18:17.297
Uh, four.
One.

18:18.831 --> 18:20.032
4 and 1.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.334
Which is 5.

18:21.401 --> 18:23.403
Yeah. 5 months.
He was 5... 5 months.

18:24.904 --> 18:26.373
Ah, shrimp, son?

18:26.439 --> 18:27.874
I really shouldn't,

18:27.940 --> 18:30.310
you know,
because I'm deathly allergic.

18:30.377 --> 18:31.878
Ah, it's just a little one.
Come on.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.380
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Are you kidding me?

18:33.446 --> 18:34.714
What?

18:34.781 --> 18:36.249
I'm sorry, but right now
you are acting

18:36.316 --> 18:38.651
like a terrible parent,
and for me,
that is a red flag.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.220
Oh.

18:40.287 --> 18:43.089
Well, good news...
he's not my kid.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.493
See?
I'm not a bad parent.

18:46.559 --> 18:48.495
I'm just a bad liar.

18:48.561 --> 18:52.131
Ugh. Why do I keep meeting
these creeps?

18:52.199 --> 18:55.202
First I'm infertile,
and now this?

18:55.268 --> 18:56.836
Being Megan is the worst.

18:56.903 --> 19:00.072
Aw, Megan, come on.
Oh, creep!

19:00.139 --> 19:02.409
Megan... Uh...

19:02.475 --> 19:04.744
Ohh.

19:05.345 --> 19:06.646
(BOTH SIGH)

19:06.713 --> 19:09.682
Well, I think we both knew
how that song was gonna end.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.050
(GROANS)

19:11.117 --> 19:13.620
You don't have to pretend
to have an adopted Asian son

19:13.686 --> 19:15.455
to get people to like you.

19:15.522 --> 19:17.424
Thanks, Dave.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.892
No one's ever said that
to me before.

19:21.528 --> 19:25.365
I guess I just want to be
in a relationship, you know?

19:25.432 --> 19:28.167
Sometimes I even think
about having kids.

19:28.235 --> 19:32.372
But after today's
cluster-munch...

19:32.439 --> 19:36.376
Well, you're responsible
enough that my dad
trusted you me.

19:36.909 --> 19:38.010
True.

19:38.077 --> 19:39.879
And while you don't have
all the qualities

19:39.946 --> 19:41.914
I've come to associate
with a father,

19:41.981 --> 19:44.517
like petulance
and unchecked narcissism...

19:46.219 --> 19:48.421
...I think
you'd be a great dad.

19:48.488 --> 19:51.190
Well, thanks, Dave.
Thanks a lot.

19:51.258 --> 19:52.625
Yeah, maybe you're right.

19:52.692 --> 19:54.827
Maybe there is hope for me
as a parent yet.

19:54.894 --> 19:55.928
(CHUCKLES)

19:55.995 --> 19:57.029
Oh, shrimp?

19:57.096 --> 19:58.465
Oh, right, not your thing.

19:58.531 --> 19:59.932
Right, right.

20:02.535 --> 20:03.670
Can you turn it down?

20:03.736 --> 20:04.737
Oh, sure.

20:07.940 --> 20:09.942
(BUTTON CLICKING)

20:15.181 --> 20:16.349
You just
made it brighter.

20:16.416 --> 20:17.884
Oh, damn it.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.688
Looking for this?

20:21.754 --> 20:24.190
(DOOR CLOSES)

20:24.257 --> 20:27.627
I, uh, stopped off
and got you new batteries.

20:27.694 --> 20:29.562
Thanks.

20:29.629 --> 20:31.898
No. Thank you.

20:34.634 --> 20:35.935
(SIGHS)

20:37.570 --> 20:38.971
You know what?

20:39.038 --> 20:40.907
It's the right thing
that he's back here.

20:40.973 --> 20:42.575
Sure you're okay
with this?

20:42.642 --> 20:45.278
Yeah, I'm fine,
'cause today I realized

20:45.345 --> 20:48.848
it feels pretty great when
your kid wants to be with you.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.149
And I'm never
gonna be the one

20:50.216 --> 20:51.818
to take that feeling
away from your dad.

20:51.884 --> 20:54.521
Aww, thanks.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.756
It's been a weird day.

20:56.823 --> 20:58.525
I was there for my dad.

20:58.591 --> 20:59.792
Molly was there for you.

20:59.859 --> 21:02.161
I guess sometimes
the universe shifts,

21:02.228 --> 21:04.331
and our roles flow
in reverse, you know?

21:04.397 --> 21:06.333
Okay, that's enough
hippie tea for you.

21:09.035 --> 21:10.737
Hey, daddios.

21:10.803 --> 21:13.172
Dave! How was
the jazz festival?

21:13.239 --> 21:15.875
Great, then odd,
then fun.

21:15.942 --> 21:17.710
Dave, do you think
when I'm old,

21:17.777 --> 21:19.145
you'd want me
to come live with you?

21:19.211 --> 21:21.848
Of course, Dad.
But don't say anything to Pat.

21:21.914 --> 21:23.316
I made the same promise
to him.

21:24.751 --> 21:25.818
'Night.

21:25.885 --> 21:27.219
