He overcame
incredible obstacles

01:12.460 --> 01:13.920
to become
the fastest,

01:13.920 --> 01:15.540
most beloved
racing dog

01:15.540 --> 01:17.080
of all time.

01:17.080 --> 01:19.920
Go-Go, the fastest dog
in the world,

01:19.920 --> 01:21.960
next on Dog-ography.

01:21.960 --> 01:24.170
I dig Go-Go.

01:24.170 --> 01:26.000
-I love Go-Go.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
I worship Go-Go.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.540
Announcer:
See Go-Go,

01:29.540 --> 01:31.170
the fastest dog in the world,

01:31.170 --> 01:33.120
running daily at De Vil Downs!

01:35.080 --> 01:36.790
All:
We gotta go-go.

02:09.330 --> 02:13.210
We wanna bet $3.37
on Go-Go.

02:13.210 --> 02:16.170
-To win.
-Out of my way!

02:16.170 --> 02:18.460
One million on Go-Go...

02:18.460 --> 02:20.750
-to win.

02:25.120 --> 02:26.540
Announcer on P.A.:
Ladies and gentlemen,

02:26.540 --> 02:29.830
please stand for Go-Go,
the fastest, greatest,

02:29.830 --> 02:32.920
most fearless dog
in the world.

02:32.920 --> 02:35.790
We're gonna win.
We're gonna win!

02:37.620 --> 02:40.040
Oh, oh!

02:42.000 --> 02:43.380
I better win.

02:48.540 --> 02:50.830
-Yay, Go-Go!
-Go, Go-Go!

02:50.830 --> 02:54.000
-He's brave.
-He's fearless.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
-He can do anything!

02:56.000 --> 02:57.880
He's just a dog.

02:57.880 --> 03:00.000
He's not just a dog.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.420
Go-Go's my hero.

03:09.920 --> 03:10.920
Oops!

03:33.420 --> 03:35.380
Announcer:
Go-Go loses the race!

03:38.540 --> 03:42.210
-No, no!
-Wretched dog!

03:42.210 --> 03:44.290
-You can't lose.

03:44.290 --> 03:46.040
You're my hero.

03:46.040 --> 03:48.040
Cruella:
Wait! Come back!

03:48.040 --> 03:51.210
Don't leave just because
the canine lost!

03:51.210 --> 03:55.750
Please, stay and gamble away
your hard-earned money.

03:55.750 --> 03:58.330
I'll give you Go-Go hats,
Go-Go T-shirts,

03:58.330 --> 04:00.000
Go

04:01.460 --> 04:04.170
Oh...

04:04.170 --> 04:08.380
So this is what
it feels like to lose money.

04:16.830 --> 04:18.670
What are we supposed to do?

04:18.670 --> 04:21.960
What are we supposed
to say to our loser hero?

04:21.960 --> 04:23.580
You'll think of something.

04:23.580 --> 04:25.250
Uh, hey, Go-Go.

04:25.250 --> 04:27.960
How's it go

04:27.960 --> 04:32.170
Not so good.
My career-- it's over!

04:32.170 --> 04:33.790
Remember, Go-Go,

04:33.790 --> 04:35.920
if you keep your face
to the sunshine,

04:35.920 --> 04:39.960
uh... be sure
to wear sunglasses.

04:41.620 --> 04:44.670
Besides, you only
lost one race.

04:44.670 --> 04:47.790
Yeah, it's not like they're
gonna tear the place down.

04:47.790 --> 04:50.830
What are you waiting for?
Tear the place down!

04:52.750 --> 04:54.170
Both:
Wait!

04:58.210 --> 05:00.290
Tear down the track?

05:00.290 --> 05:02.670
But you can't tear it down!

05:02.670 --> 05:04.380
It's our livelihood!

05:04.380 --> 05:05.420
Yeah, it's where

05:05.420 --> 05:07.080
we lose all our money.

05:07.080 --> 05:10.290
Don't tell me
about losing.

05:10.290 --> 05:12.580
First Ho-Ho loses the race,

05:12.580 --> 05:14.790
then I lose
a million-dollar wager!

05:14.790 --> 05:19.750
And now I'm losing
more money on defective
racetrack bunnies!

05:19.750 --> 05:21.880
I hate losing money!

05:21.880 --> 05:23.830
Memo to myself:
Give up gambling.

05:23.830 --> 05:26.710
It's wrong,
especially if you lose money.

05:26.710 --> 05:28.500
Just give us
one more chance...

05:28.500 --> 05:31.290
-To win our money back...
-Or lose it again.

05:32.580 --> 05:35.540
One more race this afternoon,
and that is it!

05:37.460 --> 05:40.580
Without the racetrack,
I'll be out on the streets.

05:42.920 --> 05:45.210
What am I gonna do?

05:45.210 --> 05:47.880
You're gonna win the race
this afternoon,
that's what.

05:47.880 --> 05:50.830
Cruella would never tear down
the track while you're winning.

05:50.830 --> 05:52.920
She'd lose money.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.830
And she hates losing money!

05:55.830 --> 05:58.830
I want to race,
but I can't--

05:58.830 --> 06:02.420
I can't do it.
My head, the bunny!

06:02.420 --> 06:06.290
I'm afraid. I'm afraid!

06:07.540 --> 06:09.000
Okay, now what do we do?

06:09.000 --> 06:12.380
Here's a wingy idea:
Why don't we help him?

06:12.380 --> 06:14.500
Us

06:14.500 --> 06:16.710
We're just regular puppies!

06:16.710 --> 06:20.710
He's Go-Go,
the canine hero
for all time.

06:20.710 --> 06:24.710
And with our help,
he'll never be afraid
of bunnies again!

06:26.040 --> 06:28.040
Now remember, everyone,

06:28.040 --> 06:30.790
in group therapy,
we are not here to judge.

06:30.790 --> 06:33.250
We are here to help.

06:33.250 --> 06:36.330
Okay! Which loony's
going first?

06:39.670 --> 06:42.710
-Hi, my name's Fetch.
-All: Hi, Fetch!

06:42.710 --> 06:45.750
I'm afraid of sticks.

06:45.750 --> 06:47.670
We're here for you, Fetch.

06:49.790 --> 06:50.920
Next.

06:52.040 --> 06:54.880
-Hi. My name's Kelly.
-All: Hi, Kelly.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.750
I'm afraid of sheep!

06:59.620 --> 07:01.080
That's rough, man.

07:03.920 --> 07:06.960
Hi, my name's Go-Go.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.750
-All: Hi, Go-Go!
-I'm afraid of...

07:11.790 --> 07:14.500
-bunnies.

07:21.080 --> 07:25.210
Now, just relax, Go-Go,
and tell me what you see.

07:27.330 --> 07:30.120
Uh, the post-nuclear holocaust.

07:32.420 --> 07:35.080
The horror of war
in this century.

07:37.670 --> 07:40.620
Bunny!

07:42.500 --> 07:44.830
Ugh! This is hopeless.

07:47.080 --> 07:49.420
I am just a little bunny,

07:49.420 --> 07:51.670
and I would not hurt anyone.

07:54.790 --> 07:57.830
I am just
a little bunny, and...

08:00.580 --> 08:04.670
I am just a...

08:07.960 --> 08:10.830
I need more bunnies.
Give me bunnies!

08:10.830 --> 08:13.290
Bunnies!

08:17.750 --> 08:21.750
I think Rolly has
his own bunny issues right now.

08:22.580 --> 08:27.080
Okay, this is what
we call "role reversal."

08:27.080 --> 08:30.710
You are now
the racetrack b-b-b-bunny.

08:30.710 --> 08:32.710
How do you feel?

08:36.830 --> 08:39.960
Look at me!
I'm just a cute little bunny,

08:39.960 --> 08:42.620
but you're afraid of me,
aren't you?

He's cured. Ugh!

09:01.460 --> 09:03.330
Let's get
this race over with

09:03.330 --> 09:05.210
so I can tear
the place down!

09:05.210 --> 09:09.620
But, Miss De Vil, sir,
don't you want to place
a bet on the last race?

09:09.620 --> 09:11.750
I have given up gambling.

09:11.750 --> 09:14.500
And now I want to help those
that will pay me money

09:14.500 --> 09:15.670
to do the same.

09:15.670 --> 09:19.080

One dollar on Co-Co to win.

09:31.080 --> 09:35.620
Hey, Jasper, since Cruella's
gonna lose a dollar anyway,

Oh no! I gotta help Go-Go!

Wait a minute!
It looks like Go-Go,

10:37.500 --> 10:39.620
the fastest dog in the world,

10:39.620 --> 10:42.330

10:52.500 --> 10:55.580
Go-Go, you're my hero.

10:55.580 --> 10:59.170
You make
a pretty good hero
yourself, kid.

10:59.170 --> 11:00.880
I won, I won, I won!

11:00.880 --> 11:04.960

Hey, hey, stop! Whoa!

Uh-oh.

13:01.080 --> 13:04.330
Hey, not so fast, Cadpig.

13:04.330 --> 13:07.500
You know the rule:
Stay away from my computer.

13:07.500 --> 13:11.210
That jingle was
my first paying job
in three weeks.

13:11.210 --> 13:14.290
And you! What do you
have to say for yourself?

13:14.290 --> 13:17.120
-No, no, don't even
try it, partner.

13:17.120 --> 13:18.880
I know all your tricks.

13:18.880 --> 13:22.330
Oh, Lucky, you know
I can't stay mad at you.

13:22.330 --> 13:23.790
You're my favorite.

13:23.790 --> 13:27.380
Gee, it's enough to make you
want to toss your kibble.

13:36.250 --> 13:37.710
Time to farm my land.

13:37.710 --> 13:39.830
Hey, Pete Peterson here,
of Grutely's Pet Shop,

13:39.830 --> 13:43.420
and I am looking
for the bone-diggingest dog
in the tri-county area.

13:43.420 --> 13:46.330
It's my annual
bow-wow Bone-a-thon!

13:46.330 --> 13:49.790
And winner takes home
this Man's Best Friend trophy,

13:49.790 --> 13:52.750
as well as 25% discount
on flea collars.

13:52.750 --> 13:54.330
Offer limited
to one dog per human.

13:54.330 --> 13:56.080
Thousands
of restrictions apply,

13:56.080 --> 13:59.080
prohibited where void
and other legal mumbo jumbo
and all.

13:59.080 --> 14:02.120
Oh! I hope Roger picks me!

14:02.120 --> 14:05.000
That trophy matches
my inner glow.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.460
Who cares about the trophy?

14:06.460 --> 14:09.500
I just want to bring honor
to Dearly Farm.

14:09.500 --> 14:12.290
Roger isn't picking
a chicken, Spot.

14:12.290 --> 14:15.330
He's gonna choose a dog
with a nose for bones,

14:15.330 --> 14:17.620
like me.

14:17.620 --> 14:19.540
Dream on, guys.

14:19.540 --> 14:21.920
Roger has
only one favorite,

14:21.920 --> 14:23.960
and we know who that is.

14:23.960 --> 14:26.500
Cadpig:
Oh, forgive me,
Chosen One!

14:26.500 --> 14:29.750
And if it weren't
for my total commitment
to world peace,

14:29.750 --> 14:31.540
-I'd kick your sorry little...

14:31.540 --> 14:35.830
-Gotta start practicing
for the contest.

14:35.830 --> 14:38.040
Gotta dig,
gotta pump up,

14:38.040 --> 14:40.080
and gotta feel the burn!

14:40.080 --> 14:41.670
You guys coming?

14:41.670 --> 14:45.210
Nah. I've got,
shall we say, connections.

14:45.210 --> 14:46.960
No pain, no gain.

14:52.120 --> 14:54.210
Hiccup Hole, here we come!

14:54.210 --> 14:56.250
Yippee.

15:01.120 --> 15:03.420
Hey, look!

15:06.620 --> 15:10.330
I think I got whiplash.

15:12.880 --> 15:15.250
Lucky, my boy,
I've been looking for ya.

15:15.250 --> 15:18.290
This is it.
He's gonna ask me.

15:18.290 --> 15:21.170
Bow-wow Bone-a-thon,
here I come.

15:21.170 --> 15:25.000
Hey, Lucky, how'd you like to go
with me to the Bone-- whoa!

15:25.000 --> 15:26.540
Oh! Look out!

15:27.670 --> 15:33.120
Whoa! How do
you stop this thing?

15:39.540 --> 15:43.830
Wow. Who's dug
all these amazing holes?

15:43.830 --> 15:47.330
Uh-oh, Lucky, looks like
you got some competition.

15:47.330 --> 15:51.250
Okay, so there's
somebody else out there
digging holes

15:51.250 --> 15:54.170
Hey, Roger,
wanna see me do a trick?

15:54.170 --> 15:55.830
Oof!

16:28.670 --> 16:31.210
Tripod. Shoulda known.

16:31.210 --> 16:33.670
Man, he's good.

16:33.670 --> 16:36.540
It's like he's one
with the dirt.

16:44.420 --> 16:48.080
Okay, he wants a hole?
I'll give him holes.

16:51.460 --> 16:53.710
Hey, boy.
All these holes prove to me

16:53.710 --> 16:57.500
I just found
the bone-diggingest dog
in the tri-county area.

16:57.500 --> 16:59.580
What say we head
to the contest, huh?

17:00.580 --> 17:03.790
Hey, no pain, no gain,
right, Lucky?

17:13.040 --> 17:16.000
Roger's choosing
Tripod over me?

17:16.000 --> 17:17.710
We gotta get him
to a doctor.

17:17.710 --> 17:21.750
Maybe he's a clone.
His body's been snatched
in an alien invasion.

17:21.750 --> 17:25.000
Well, it looks like
their ship is taking off.

17:26.250 --> 17:27.960
I can't believe it.

17:27.960 --> 17:29.420
That's harsh, man.

17:29.420 --> 17:31.750
Why didn't Roger
pick me?

17:31.750 --> 17:34.120
Spot: Hmm, let me
take a stab at this.

17:34.120 --> 17:37.080
'Cause Tripod practiced.
'Cause he worked hard.

17:37.080 --> 17:40.000
-'Cause he's better.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.920
I never even tried.

17:41.920 --> 17:45.830
Ah! I think
we've identified
the problem.

17:45.830 --> 17:49.040
I'm sure this is just
one big misunderstanding.

17:49.040 --> 17:52.080
You watch. Any minute now,
Roger will climb up here

17:52.080 --> 17:54.500
-and tell me
it was all a big joke.

17:54.500 --> 17:58.420
Good luck, Tripod!
Do us proud!

17:58.420 --> 18:00.620
If Tripod wins this contest,

18:00.620 --> 18:02.830
Roger's gonna have
a new favorite!

18:02.830 --> 18:05.250
No! No!

18:07.120 --> 18:08.210
Whoa!

18:12.330 --> 18:16.120
Those other dogs
will just be scratching

18:16.120 --> 18:17.750
the surface
next to you, buddy.

18:17.750 --> 18:21.000
You are a champ!
A champ!

18:22.250 --> 18:24.000
-Roger: Oh boy.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.290
Rain. Hope they
don't cancel the contest.

18:27.460 --> 18:31.790
-25% off each flea collar.

18:31.790 --> 18:33.540
At $3.99 a piece,

18:33.540 --> 18:36.120
that's about one-fourth
off four dollars.

18:36.120 --> 18:38.960
I'll save a dollar
on each collar.

18:38.960 --> 18:41.670
For 101 puppies,
I'd save $101.

18:41.670 --> 18:44.170
Cool! My wipers
look like Lucky.

18:44.170 --> 18:45.380
Hey!

18:49.540 --> 18:51.380
-Roger: Whoa!

18:56.210 --> 18:59.000
I can almost reach--

19:01.080 --> 19:03.080
Ho-ho!

19:08.250 --> 19:12.580
I can't reach-- oh! Oh!

19:16.460 --> 19:18.670
Oh, no! Oh, no, no!

19:23.750 --> 19:26.710
Oh, that was close.

19:26.710 --> 19:28.790
Tripod, you saved us.

19:28.790 --> 19:30.830
Yeah, my hero.

19:30.830 --> 19:32.290
Hey!

19:35.460 --> 19:37.250
Well, the good news is
it stopped raining.

19:37.250 --> 19:39.540
Bad news is
we'll never make it in time.

19:40.960 --> 19:43.880
I've got an idea.
We can try digging out.

19:50.120 --> 19:53.830
Guess the super scooper
ain't that super duper.

19:56.040 --> 19:59.040
Hey, Lucky.
Quit being a pain
and help me out here.

19:59.040 --> 20:02.670
Maybe wood or branches
slid under the wheels
would help.

20:03.830 --> 20:05.080
Oh well.

20:05.080 --> 20:08.750
Guess you won't be taking
my place with Roger after all.

20:08.750 --> 20:12.170
What are you talking about?
I just want a chance
at that contest.

20:13.830 --> 20:16.500
But now I'll never know
if I could've won.

20:16.500 --> 20:19.620
Of course you would've won.
You win everything.

20:19.620 --> 20:22.580
Nobody works harder than you.

20:22.580 --> 20:24.380
Lotta good that does me now.

20:24.380 --> 20:28.290
It's not my place
with Roger you were after.

20:28.290 --> 20:29.960
It was winning the contest.

20:29.960 --> 20:32.880
Oh man,
I've been so selfish.

20:32.880 --> 20:34.960
-Get a grip!

20:34.960 --> 20:37.750
I said get a grip!
Let's start digging!

20:43.290 --> 20:44.830
Stay clear, you guys.

20:48.960 --> 20:50.540
-Hey!
-Hey!

20:51.790 --> 20:54.790
Well, we tried.
Thanks for helping, Lucky.

20:54.790 --> 20:57.620
We're not out yet!
Come on!

21:00.250 --> 21:02.580
That's a good look for you.

21:02.580 --> 21:05.500
Be careful, Lucky.
You don't wanna break a nail.

21:09.790 --> 21:11.960
Come on, you two!
We gotta get to Grutely!

21:21.250 --> 21:23.960
-Man: Yeah, come on, Buldzer!

21:23.960 --> 21:25.580
Show 'em who's boss, buddy!

21:26.920 --> 21:30.080
Come on, Buldzer!
Way to go, buddy!

21:30.080 --> 21:32.000
Way to go!
Keep going!

21:37.040 --> 21:38.750
Looks like
Tripod is tired.

21:43.670 --> 21:44.960
Do us proud, buddy!

21:44.960 --> 21:45.960
Five seconds...

21:47.040 --> 21:49.790
four... three...

21:51.330 --> 21:53.460
-two...
-Lucky: Come on, Tripod!

21:53.460 --> 21:54.830
...one!

21:54.830 --> 21:59.080
He won! He won!
We all won!

22:00.620 --> 22:02.830
Sorry I was such a jerk.

22:02.830 --> 22:05.580
Well, I couldn't have
done it without you

22:05.580 --> 22:07.120
helping us out of the mud.

22:07.120 --> 22:09.170
Collars for everybody!
