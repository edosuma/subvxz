WEBVTT

00:06.700 --> 00:08.812
Ah! The library.

00:08.900 --> 00:11.818
I love the smell of
thinkin' in the morning.

00:18.053 --> 00:20.085
<i>The Myth
of the Shadow Realm.</i>

00:20.788 --> 00:23.167
"Myth." Ha!
Nice try, book.

00:23.255 --> 00:25.065
But I will not be deterred
in my quest.

00:25.153 --> 00:26.613
I can't be.

00:31.600 --> 00:34.170
Library day. Again.

00:34.799 --> 00:36.212
Wave hello to Ralph.

00:36.331 --> 00:38.444
Morning, Ralph!
It's me, Webby!

00:41.600 --> 00:43.013
Swipe your
library card,

00:43.100 --> 00:45.513
realize you're
swiping it backwards,

00:45.749 --> 00:47.911
and head to the supernatural
reference section

00:47.999 --> 00:49.741
to annoy the librarian
on duty.

00:50.045 --> 00:52.749
Hi! I'm Webby, and I need
your help with some books.

00:54.772 --> 00:57.715
Mrs. Quackfaster?
What are you doing here?

00:57.803 --> 01:00.911
Working a second job to
pay for a retirement condo

01:00.999 --> 01:04.163
in Birdbados!

01:05.912 --> 01:08.723
Well, I'm just doing some
casual research on shadow magic.

01:08.811 --> 01:11.637
Not trying to bring my best friend
back from its depths or anything.

01:11.725 --> 01:13.866
You are a bizarre one.

01:14.428 --> 01:17.607
Anyway, I'm looking for
<i>Spirits of the Shadow Realm.</i>

01:18.690 --> 01:20.014
Give it up, Pink.

01:20.102 --> 01:22.530
You've messed with enough magic
for one lifetime.

01:22.618 --> 01:23.699
I'll be fine.

01:23.810 --> 01:26.513
In the shadow realm.
Forever.

01:26.733 --> 01:29.332
I cannot lend you
this book.

01:29.420 --> 01:32.004
Because it holds dark
and forbidden secrets?

01:32.092 --> 01:35.631
No, because another odd little
girl already checked it out.

01:36.724 --> 01:38.303
Hi! I'm Web...

01:44.850 --> 01:45.856
Yes?

01:45.944 --> 01:47.957
I see you have
<i>Spirits of the Shadow Realm.</i>

01:48.045 --> 01:51.467
The book's written in ancient
Syriac, so it may be a bit advanced.

01:59.217 --> 02:02.483
Conversational?
Is there any other kind?

02:07.480 --> 02:08.690
Nerds.

02:10.491 --> 02:12.773
- Violet Sabrewing.
- Webby.

02:13.147 --> 02:15.692
Webbigail Vanderquack?
Of McDuck Manor?

02:15.780 --> 02:18.809
Trusted companion in many of
Scrooge McDuck's adventures?

02:18.897 --> 02:20.965
Oh, gee. Uh, yeah, no.

02:21.053 --> 02:23.301
I mean, I...
I'm more of a faithful ward.

02:23.389 --> 02:25.895
All right, enough with the love fest.
Just grab the book and...

02:25.983 --> 02:28.809
You must have a fascinating
perspective on the supernatural.

02:28.897 --> 02:31.893
I've...
had a few experiences.

02:32.202 --> 02:34.563
- Have you?
- Hold up, Pink.

02:34.650 --> 02:37.309
If you need this book to
further your own exploration,

02:37.397 --> 02:38.844
I'm happy to review
it with you.

02:38.932 --> 02:41.022
Uh, sorry. She's got
a library day routine.

02:41.147 --> 02:42.393
Webby, let's roll.

02:42.670 --> 02:44.707
- Okay!
- You're home at 5:00.

02:44.795 --> 02:47.067
I'll bring my bedclothes,
should our research extend

02:47.155 --> 02:49.114
longer than anticipated
and I have to stay the night.

02:49.201 --> 02:51.284
- Good day.
- Um, okay!

02:51.371 --> 02:54.387
- See you tonight!
- Oh, no. A sleepover.

02:54.475 --> 02:56.661
Oh, boy!
A sleepover!

02:56.749 --> 02:57.983
Shh, shh, shh!

03:41.341 --> 03:44.271
Mmm, Bin-ventory Day.

03:44.359 --> 03:46.940
Mr. McDuck and the boys
are cataloguing treasure

03:47.028 --> 03:48.570
at the office all evening.

03:48.712 --> 03:51.140
Just a nice, quiet...

03:51.251 --> 03:54.123
Granny! I have a friend coming
over for a sleepover tonight!

03:54.211 --> 03:56.982
She speaks Old Norse!
I can't wait!

03:57.070 --> 03:59.937
Webbigail,
that's splendid news.

04:00.025 --> 04:02.003
Good for you for getting
back on the friendship horse.

04:02.090 --> 04:02.934
Thanks, Gran.

04:03.022 --> 04:06.142
This is a big step,
given your past sleepovers.

04:06.230 --> 04:09.011
Well...
- That money-bin incident with the mystical shark,

04:09.099 --> 04:11.147
the vicious unicorn battle
in the other bin...

04:11.235 --> 04:13.928
- You knew about that?
- But look at you now,

04:14.016 --> 04:16.908
giving the sleepover
the old college try.

04:17.043 --> 04:19.252
You're right.
Every sleepover I ever had

04:19.339 --> 04:21.928
ended in some kind of
supernatural disaster.

04:22.017 --> 04:23.843
Yes!
I mean, sure,

04:23.931 --> 04:26.267
I was the cause of most
of those disasters, but...

04:26.355 --> 04:29.541
And they all led to me losing
Lena to the Shadow Realm.

04:29.629 --> 04:31.346
- Yes, but...
- I can't put another friend

04:31.433 --> 04:32.679
in mystical peril!

04:32.767 --> 04:34.411
There's only
one thing to do...

04:34.513 --> 04:36.279
- Cancel the sleepover.
- Make this the most normal

04:36.366 --> 04:37.469
sleepover ever!

04:37.557 --> 04:38.939
No!

04:39.027 --> 04:41.621
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, just, uh, you know,

04:41.709 --> 04:44.319
normal kid stuff,
like, uh, uh, games!

04:44.407 --> 04:47.240
Yeah! And, I don't know, pie!
Pie! Is that normal? Oh!

04:47.328 --> 04:49.895
- Oh, I gotta hide my stuff!
- Webby, dear.

04:49.983 --> 04:51.756
Gotta-Gotta hide
anything that's mystical

04:51.844 --> 04:53.756
or cursed
or screams "adventure."

04:59.342 --> 05:00.672
Whoa!

05:02.779 --> 05:04.192
I know
you're anxious,

05:04.280 --> 05:06.047
but the best way to make
a good impression

05:06.135 --> 05:07.485
is to be yourself.

05:07.573 --> 05:09.616
I've never been
anyone but myself,

05:09.763 --> 05:12.336
barring that summer undercover
in Parrotguay.

05:12.502 --> 05:15.415
Granny, I'm not like you.
I need friends.

05:15.503 --> 05:18.637
What?
I have... friends.

05:18.796 --> 05:20.024
Yeah,

05:20.111 --> 05:21.890
I'm sure you do!
I gotta go!

05:21.978 --> 05:24.249
Name one person
I don't get along with!

05:24.337 --> 05:25.366
Hey, Mrs. B.

05:25.454 --> 05:27.943
I just finished fixing that
gate I broke on the way in.

05:28.031 --> 05:31.194
Just a heads-up... I'm probably
gonna break it on the way out too.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.197
Launchpad, if you're
not busy this evening,

05:37.285 --> 05:38.335
sup with me?

05:38.423 --> 05:39.966
Uh, 'sup with you?

05:40.054 --> 05:41.900
I guess you're British
or something?

05:42.026 --> 05:43.608
Hmm.

05:44.249 --> 05:45.983
No, I mean supper.

05:46.071 --> 05:47.701
Would you like
to have dinner?

05:47.789 --> 05:49.520
Oh, yeah.
Every single day.

05:49.608 --> 05:52.149
Ooh, maybe I'll make myself
taquitos tonight! -

05:54.000 --> 06:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:04.649 --> 06:06.171
Ah! Perfect.

06:06.259 --> 06:07.912
Nothing weird here.

06:08.816 --> 06:10.986
Duckworth,
could you get that?

06:11.366 --> 06:13.385
Wait. Ghost butler!

06:23.897 --> 06:25.406
Sorry, Duckworth!

06:27.855 --> 06:28.981
Whew!

06:29.213 --> 06:32.169
Big house.
I... run everywhere.

06:32.257 --> 06:33.967
Violet, hello!

06:37.985 --> 06:39.228
I brought pie.

06:39.418 --> 06:43.230
A pie! How normal!
Come in!

06:43.632 --> 06:46.089
Pie? I'm not buying
what this chick's selling.

07:01.672 --> 07:04.085
Oh, if you're having
trouble with the utensils,

07:04.173 --> 07:05.789
I'm more than happy
to help.

07:06.728 --> 07:09.624
Oh, no.
I got this, Mrs. B.

07:13.566 --> 07:15.733
Mmm! Whoa-oa!

07:15.827 --> 07:17.154
Oh!

07:18.408 --> 07:19.709
Huh?

07:20.119 --> 07:22.319
Hmm. Yeah.

07:44.817 --> 07:47.240
And this is my room.

07:56.025 --> 07:58.228
Clean. Spartan.
I like it.

07:58.363 --> 07:59.610
Now to business.

08:00.755 --> 08:02.622
I was just going
to dip my toe

08:02.710 --> 08:04.861
into the thrilling world
of Tulpas.

08:04.949 --> 08:06.212
Tulpas?

08:07.485 --> 08:09.510
Tulpas are
manifestations

08:09.598 --> 08:10.908
of powerful emotions...

08:10.996 --> 08:13.119
Hatred, jealousy,
greed.

08:13.279 --> 08:16.692
They live in a dark realm
adjacent to our reality.

08:16.882 --> 08:18.875
It's the closest thing
I've found in my research

08:18.963 --> 08:20.586
to explain
what happened the night

08:20.674 --> 08:23.087
the shadows attacked
Duckburg, and...

08:23.188 --> 08:24.891
Who likes Baggle?

08:24.987 --> 08:26.059
Everyone.

08:26.153 --> 08:29.291
But I thought I was here
to review the book with you.

08:29.386 --> 08:32.755
Oh, we have plenty of time for that.
It's a sleepover!

08:32.874 --> 08:34.195
So, uh, let's start with some

08:34.283 --> 08:36.331
icebreakers to get
to know each other!

08:36.419 --> 08:37.912
Okay.
I'll go first.

08:38.015 --> 08:40.323
What do you know
about Magica DeSpell

08:40.419 --> 08:41.995
and the Shadow War?

08:42.140 --> 08:45.309
Aha! She just said
the "M" word!

08:45.397 --> 08:48.621
- Makeovers!
- What? No! Magica.

08:48.709 --> 08:50.696
For a girl clearly versed
in the supernatural,

08:50.784 --> 08:52.332
you are oddly
nervous about it.

08:52.419 --> 08:54.702
But I'm not nervous
about sparkles!

08:54.789 --> 08:56.042
Normal night!

08:56.289 --> 08:58.450
Why is this brainiac

08:58.538 --> 09:01.438
using Webby to learn
about Aunt Magica?

09:03.430 --> 09:05.997
Wait.
Is that my amulet?

09:06.829 --> 09:08.238
Webby!

09:15.999 --> 09:17.252
If Violet has my amulet,

09:17.340 --> 09:19.205
she may be trying to
channel Magica's powers.

09:19.293 --> 09:21.286
I have to warn Webby
before it's...

09:25.269 --> 09:28.246
- Too late!
- I look amazing!

09:31.712 --> 09:34.133
I love wearing makeup!

09:34.546 --> 09:37.129
The splayed dermis
is a nice touch.

09:38.335 --> 09:40.948
This was fun.
Moving on.

09:41.185 --> 09:44.509
Aw, but you look exactly
like the demon Rakshasa!

09:44.717 --> 09:47.290
Hmm. The fangs
seem off-kilter.

09:47.378 --> 09:49.784
Oh, he has one crooked fang
from a poker brawl.

09:49.872 --> 09:52.152
- I have proof...
- You do? Where?

09:52.240 --> 09:53.685
Definitely not the attic.

09:53.773 --> 09:55.835
Do not share
your secrets!

09:58.558 --> 10:00.419
Wait!

10:00.507 --> 10:01.947
This is exactly what
she wants you to do,

10:02.034 --> 10:04.821
because that's exactly
what I would have done!

10:11.106 --> 10:14.052
"To Webby...
Stay gold! Rakky."

10:14.935 --> 10:16.332
That fang is
indeed crooked.

10:16.492 --> 10:18.653
Is all this stuff
weirding you out?

10:18.741 --> 10:21.537
On the contrary.
This is all fascinating.

10:21.823 --> 10:24.000
And I'm detecting
a strong

10:24.088 --> 10:27.257
ectoplasmic aura
coming from...

10:28.449 --> 10:31.773
Is this some form
of friendship bracelet?

10:32.248 --> 10:34.115
That is not yours!

10:35.465 --> 10:38.589
Ah, that's nothing.
Let's play a game instead.

10:45.801 --> 10:49.411
Using ancient Demogorgan runes
to contact shadow spirits?

10:49.577 --> 10:52.117
- Baggle?
- Rune Baggle?

10:53.097 --> 10:54.180
Deal.

10:54.445 --> 10:57.209
Contact spirits, huh?

11:06.911 --> 11:08.684
Aah! Whoa.

11:25.375 --> 11:27.644
Just do it already!
Go ahead and fire me!

11:27.732 --> 11:30.582
What? uh, I'm not
going to fire you.

11:30.669 --> 11:34.286
Well, then why are you being so
nice to me and buttering me up?

11:34.374 --> 11:36.962
I'm trying to establish
a bond of friendship.

11:37.050 --> 11:38.917
Surely we share
some interests.

11:39.005 --> 11:40.295
Politics?

11:41.419 --> 11:42.834
Sports? Cricket!

11:42.922 --> 11:45.169
I'm not really
a bug guy, per se.

11:46.158 --> 11:48.633
You're a pilot.
What are your thoughts on

11:48.721 --> 11:51.255
ramjet propulsion engines
versus turboprops?

11:51.919 --> 11:53.790
Mm. Yes.

11:53.878 --> 11:57.791
The propellers, they put the plane...
in the sky.

11:57.879 --> 11:59.242
Uh-huh.

11:59.329 --> 12:00.727
Uh, fine.

12:00.815 --> 12:03.181
I suppose we'll just never
have anything in common.

12:03.564 --> 12:07.009
- Where'd you get that Darkwing book?
- Beg your pardon? Oh.

12:07.097 --> 12:09.624
That is the Scarlet
Pimperbill, a masked man

12:09.712 --> 12:12.318
who stalks the city at night
to protect people from harm.

12:12.406 --> 12:13.884
Just like
Darkwing Duck.

12:13.972 --> 12:16.251
Uh, I don't know
what that is.

12:16.504 --> 12:20.037
What? Lady... heh!
Hold on to your cape.

12:20.479 --> 12:24.284
This night's about
to get dangerous.

12:28.741 --> 12:32.399
I'm awakening the vibrations
of the Shadow Spirits.

12:43.701 --> 12:47.133
Shadows of the dark realm,
find favor with my call.

12:47.443 --> 12:48.577
Forget what I said,
Webby.

12:48.696 --> 12:51.271
This girl doesn't know squat
about the Shadow Realm.

12:51.359 --> 12:55.602
Make your presence known,
great spirits one and all.

12:57.063 --> 12:59.128
What? Oh, no.

13:01.976 --> 13:05.080
I touched that?
I touched that!

13:05.211 --> 13:08.377
How did I touch that?
Oh, she's good.

13:11.633 --> 13:13.404
Ah, that could've
been anything...

13:13.492 --> 13:15.607
The wind
or the house settling.

13:18.350 --> 13:20.080
Or shadow spirits!

13:23.028 --> 13:26.351
- Communication from the other realm.
- What does it say?

13:26.476 --> 13:28.208
It's Elder Futhark.

13:28.446 --> 13:30.966
"Thunder trots."
A reference to

13:31.054 --> 13:34.523
the four horsemen
of the apocalypse, perhaps?

13:34.611 --> 13:37.899
Oh! I also see
"rodent truths."

13:37.986 --> 13:40.222
Ooh, what secrets
are the mice hiding?

13:40.310 --> 13:43.519
- It says, "Don't trust her."
- Ugh! Nerds!

13:43.606 --> 13:45.776
We need more clarity.

14:04.588 --> 14:05.613
What the...

14:05.701 --> 14:07.914
Oh, no.
I gotta stop her!

14:08.002 --> 14:09.655
Uh, think, think,
think, think.

14:09.743 --> 14:12.446
How else can a spirit communicate
with the land of the living?

14:12.816 --> 14:15.232
Ugh! How cliche.

14:21.132 --> 14:23.688
Webby,
don't trust her!

14:23.776 --> 14:25.639
She's summoning
evil spirits!

14:26.644 --> 14:29.357
We've summoned
an evil spirit!

14:29.445 --> 14:33.480
Evil spirit?
Right, you can't hear me.

14:35.366 --> 14:38.519
Why do all my slumber parties
end in supernatural vengeance?

14:47.606 --> 14:49.229
Webby!

14:49.363 --> 14:50.485
Lena?

14:51.269 --> 14:52.686
Violet?

14:59.116 --> 15:00.980
Where did you get that?

15:02.007 --> 15:06.079
Slumber party's over.
Start talking. Now!

15:06.371 --> 15:07.757
I'm gonna need
some answers,

15:07.845 --> 15:10.894
or I'm gonna knock you into
the Shadow Realm the hard way.

15:13.532 --> 15:15.558
I found it on the beach.

15:15.866 --> 15:17.965
All my life,
I've been rational,

15:18.132 --> 15:20.698
<i>never giving things like magic
a second thought.</i>

15:20.849 --> 15:22.898
<i>But when the Shadow War
happened,</i>

15:22.986 --> 15:25.020
<i>it jolted something in me,</i>

15:25.156 --> 15:26.814
opened my eyes.

15:30.519 --> 15:35.094
<i>There's a world beyond
textbooks and rational truths,</i>

15:36.954 --> 15:39.877
<i>one I'm compelled
to know more about.</i>

15:43.276 --> 15:46.781
Have you ever felt like you
were living a sheltered life,

15:46.869 --> 15:51.182
but there was something
incredible just out of reach?

15:53.986 --> 15:55.673
They're gone.

15:55.950 --> 15:57.968
You aren't buying this,
are you?

15:58.190 --> 16:00.994
- Uh...
- Ugh, you're totally buying it.

16:01.082 --> 16:02.671
You shouldn't mess
with that amulet.

16:02.759 --> 16:05.738
I've already lost one friend
to the Shadow Realm.

16:07.696 --> 16:09.949
Hmm. Lena, yes?

16:10.036 --> 16:12.276
What if I could
bring her back?

16:12.364 --> 16:14.183
- What? - What?
- If Lena was banished

16:14.271 --> 16:17.456
back into the Shadow Realm,
as you say, then perhaps

16:17.544 --> 16:20.459
using Magica's amulet,
we might be able to

16:20.547 --> 16:23.940
harness those powers
and pull Lena back home.

16:24.115 --> 16:25.877
This is dangerous,
Pink.

16:28.151 --> 16:31.503
Let's crack open the Shadow
Realm and get my friend back.

16:46.350 --> 16:49.879
<i>Suck gas, you perfidiously
possessed plantain!</i>

16:54.331 --> 16:56.290
Well, look at us two.

16:56.378 --> 16:59.835
Couple of work buddies sharing...
Don't go in there, D.W.!

17:00.047 --> 17:03.306
So Quackerjack summoned Paddywhack
from the Jack-in-the-box

17:03.402 --> 17:06.373
so Paddywhack could possess
Quackerjack's doll,

17:06.548 --> 17:09.185
Mr. Banana Brain,
who is attacking Darkwing.

17:09.272 --> 17:11.441
Yeah, the mythology
is pretty dense.

17:11.529 --> 17:14.079
Yes, this is
certainly dense.

17:14.167 --> 17:17.148
I hear you. Let's watch the third
episode again to clear it up.

17:17.236 --> 17:19.648
We are, after all,
bonding.

17:19.824 --> 17:22.108
Well, I hope the girls
are having a good time.

17:30.917 --> 17:34.109
Webby, she's using you!
I should know!

17:34.196 --> 17:35.817
Quit now, before...

17:42.445 --> 17:43.914
What?

17:48.730 --> 17:53.193
No. Not her. Not again!

17:55.872 --> 17:58.224
Conjure your forces now.

17:58.351 --> 18:01.036
Rise and speak to me!

18:01.196 --> 18:03.117
Webby, it's a trap!

18:08.820 --> 18:10.638
Uh... hi?

18:11.654 --> 18:12.938
Lena!

18:13.180 --> 18:15.102
I hate to break up
this heartwarming reunion,

18:15.190 --> 18:16.978
but these Tulpas
are edging closer.

18:17.327 --> 18:19.512
Where are my manners?
Lena, this is...

18:19.600 --> 18:21.386
Oh, I know
who she is!

18:21.474 --> 18:23.333
A spy! A thief!

18:23.421 --> 18:25.694
A second-rate
knockoff of me!

18:25.829 --> 18:28.924
Get away from Webby.
She's mine!

18:39.906 --> 18:41.202
This is your fault!

18:41.290 --> 18:43.818
If you hadn't meddled with magic,
Webby would still be safe!

18:43.906 --> 18:46.333
The Tulpas are manifestations
of great desire.

18:46.421 --> 18:48.566
Like your desire
for magical power.

18:48.654 --> 18:51.227
Or your desire not to be
forgotten by Webbigail.

18:51.315 --> 18:53.102
Newton's apple,
you are dense!

18:53.190 --> 18:55.471
You'll note the Tulpas
have taken your form.

18:59.817 --> 19:02.820
They are manifestations
of your own jealousy,

19:02.908 --> 19:05.379
trying to keep Webbigail
with you in the Shadow Realm!

19:05.467 --> 19:06.950
Ugh! Maybe.

19:07.038 --> 19:08.319
Look, We have
nothing in common,

19:08.406 --> 19:10.065
but we do both seem
to care about...

19:10.153 --> 19:12.399
- Help!
- Webby! - Webby!

19:17.940 --> 19:20.849
That was a surprisingly
suspenseful twist.

19:21.086 --> 19:23.468
- Put the next tape in.
- No can do.

19:23.556 --> 19:25.978
The show was canceled
before the finale.

19:26.066 --> 19:28.124
But-But what happens next?

19:28.212 --> 19:30.053
They can't just
end the show like that!

19:30.141 --> 19:31.801
I have to know
what happens!

19:31.889 --> 19:34.805
Uh, I have a few theories,

19:34.893 --> 19:36.819
which I've put
into a fan script.

19:36.906 --> 19:39.913
See, with the help of his new best
friend and pilot, Launchpad, Darkwing...

19:40.001 --> 19:43.393
We must film this.

19:43.481 --> 19:45.282
Whoo-hoo!

19:46.595 --> 19:48.820
If she goes out that door,
we may lose her forever.

19:48.908 --> 19:51.479
Not on my watch.
Come on, nerd.

19:51.919 --> 19:53.930
Let's make magic.

19:54.049 --> 19:56.454
With the hand
of my friend's friend,

19:56.542 --> 19:58.899
we bring bitter jealousy
to an end.

19:59.172 --> 20:01.580
With the hand of
my friend's friend,

20:01.668 --> 20:03.981
We bring bitter jealousy
to an end.

20:04.107 --> 20:06.319
With the hand
of my friend's friend,

20:06.406 --> 20:09.074
we bring bitter jealousy
to an end.

20:09.177 --> 20:11.583
With the hand
of my friend's friend,

20:11.671 --> 20:14.308
we bring bitter jealousy
to an end.

20:16.460 --> 20:17.750
Huh?

20:46.825 --> 20:48.797
I'm back?

20:48.900 --> 20:51.831
You certainly look
like you're back.

20:54.842 --> 20:56.439
You're back!

20:58.443 --> 21:00.872
Hey, Webby, you have any more
of those smoke bombs?

21:00.960 --> 21:04.019
Hurry, Launchpad, let's get this shot
before the boys are back and ruin our fun.

21:04.106 --> 21:06.450
Suck gas, evildoers!

21:06.775 --> 21:08.468
Never mind.
We found some.

21:08.556 --> 21:11.193
Oh, hey, Lena.
Whee!

21:13.180 --> 21:15.603
You've been with me
this whole time?

21:15.691 --> 21:18.852
Well, I wanted to make sure nothing
bad happened to you, or whatever.

21:18.940 --> 21:21.475
That is the sweetest,
non-creepiest thing

21:21.563 --> 21:23.357
anyone's ever said to me.

21:23.445 --> 21:26.358
I've got my old best friend,
I've got my new best friend,

21:26.446 --> 21:27.632
I've got pie!

21:27.720 --> 21:31.603
Oh, this is easily the most
successful sleepover I've ever had.

21:31.804 --> 21:35.127
Yes, it was very
educational.

21:35.350 --> 21:38.382
A shame you didn't listen
to your friend earlier.

21:38.470 --> 21:41.633
Now I will use
that knowledge to seek

21:41.721 --> 21:44.714
grim vengeance
upon you all!

21:52.511 --> 21:53.739
I can joke too.

21:53.827 --> 21:56.125
You were right.
She totally bought it.

21:56.570 --> 21:57.735
Good one, Vi.

21:57.823 --> 21:59.826
Best friends!
