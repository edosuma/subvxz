05:06.702 --> 05:08.976
Shall I tell you something?

05:15.340 --> 05:17.807
Time ruins everything.

05:34.696 --> 05:37.289
I just made that up.

05:40.214 --> 05:42.569
What happened to you?

05:48.292 --> 05:50.726
I will tell you.

05:55.371 --> 05:58.043
I spent some time in prison
because...

06:03.289 --> 06:05.961
because I had sex with my daughter.

06:06.368 --> 06:09.519
The western syndrome.

06:22.365 --> 06:24.924
I think about it all the time.

06:32.242 --> 06:36.519
It was everything I had left,
I had nothing else.

06:36.841 --> 06:39.116
I never had anything.

06:49.278 --> 06:51.394
It was cute.

06:55.477 --> 06:57.831
Easy now.

07:00.396 --> 07:04.513
We`re all... mefisto`s.

07:04.715 --> 07:06.670
I want to bring you some fun.

07:06.874 --> 07:11.071
Guys who fool around a bit and
then hear it`s something bad.

07:11.473 --> 07:13.668
That it`s dramatic.

07:14.593 --> 07:18.505
But you can`t forget the joy
and the happiness.

07:19.192 --> 07:21.182
There are no...

07:23.111 --> 07:26.307
There are no crimes,
only actions.

07:37.107 --> 07:39.905
I have to start over.

07:40.747 --> 07:44.022
I have to quit, I have to live.

07:45.146 --> 07:48.342
Keep on fighting, staying alive.

07:48.545 --> 07:51.263
I understand you completely.
Do you have something to drink?

07:51.824 --> 07:53.894
No, I don´t have anything to drink.

07:54.104 --> 07:58.539
I have no penny.
Oh what...

07:59.262 --> 08:03.174
What´s that noise outside?

08:03.381 --> 08:05.941
Nothing.

08:07.700 --> 08:09.372
The assholes from downstairs.

08:09.580 --> 08:13.618
They give their usual show
in the Rectum.

08:13.819 --> 08:16.537
Right.
- Rectum!

08:19.658 --> 08:21.534
What kind of crime?
- With blood.

08:21.737 --> 08:25.331
Blood? Does someone have
her period or something?

08:25.616 --> 08:27.652
May I wait here for a while?

08:27.856 --> 08:31.052
They still owe me money.
What happened?

08:31.255 --> 08:33.529
I told you those bastards
wouldn`t pay.

08:33.734 --> 08:35.246
Step aside please.

08:35.453 --> 08:39.809
Morad, check out that guys
fucked up face.

08:40.013 --> 08:42.128
Is your leg fucked up, pal?

08:42.412 --> 08:44.368
Your ass too, I hope.

08:44.572 --> 08:48.450
Like Alex. I hope you bleed a lot.
And that you`re in a lot of pain.

08:48.651 --> 08:50.959
His asshole must have
bled a lot.

08:51.170 --> 08:53.286
Fucker. Fag.

08:53.490 --> 08:57.641
Because of those two guys
the fuckers got us.

08:57.849 --> 08:59.839
They will be happy in the street.

09:00.048 --> 09:02.767
But I want my money.

09:02.968 --> 09:06.516
Why are we still standing here?
We`ll get our money or go.

09:06.727 --> 09:09.957
Fucking fags.
There are gays all over here.

09:10.166 --> 09:12.599
It`s god damn impossible,
they are everywhere.

09:33.801 --> 09:35.711
Clear the path.

09:36.560 --> 09:39.790
Get rid of that asshole.

09:39.999 --> 09:42.990
And cuff him.

09:43.198 --> 09:45.109
They will fuck him in the
ass in prison.

09:45.318 --> 09:48.115
I`m waiting for my money.
- Move it.

09:48.317 --> 09:52.832
I hope you`ll be miserable in jail
and that they fuck you in the ass.

09:53.116 --> 09:56.551
Fucking history and philosophy
teacher.

09:56.755 --> 10:00.270
Fuscking moron.
- All philosophers are fags.

10:00.674 --> 10:02.585
I hope they get you hard.

10:02.794 --> 10:05.546
To the station.
- In prison there are no condoms.

10:05.753 --> 10:08.267
You`ll get aids straigh away, fag.

15:01.925 --> 15:03.643
What are you doing?
- I`m looking for The Tapeworm.

15:03.845 --> 15:06.597
You have to pay.
- I`m already paying.

15:06.804 --> 15:08.237
Go ahead.

15:10.803 --> 15:13.555
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?

15:14.802 --> 15:17.555
We`ll find him,
we`ll find him.

15:18.681 --> 15:22.229
You`re not human anymore. Even animals
don`t revenge themselves, Marcus.

15:22.440 --> 15:23.714
It`s going totally wrong.

15:23.920 --> 15:25.478
Leave me alone.
- You won`t survive.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.988
It`s none of your business.
- It smells like shit here.

15:28.199 --> 15:29.871
Quit it, Marcus.

15:30.079 --> 15:33.070
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?
- No.

15:34.558 --> 15:39.028
Marcus, come back!
I won`t save you.

15:40.276 --> 15:42.710
Marcus, stop it now.

15:45.995 --> 15:48.508
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?
- No.

16:03.191 --> 16:04.943
Pierre!

16:05.271 --> 16:07.500
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?

16:12.309 --> 16:14.947
Do you know The Tapeworm?

16:23.746 --> 16:25.737
The Tapeworm?

16:29.545 --> 16:31.137
Pierre!

16:40.423 --> 16:42.982
It goes on downstairs.
We`re going once.

16:43.182 --> 16:47.220
We`re going down once.
Come on, one time. Help me, Pierre.

16:48.901 --> 16:52.017
Do you know The Tapeworm?

16:52.220 --> 16:54.175
Why are you smiling?

17:03.337 --> 17:06.806
The Tapeworm...
Do you know The Tapeworm? No?

17:07.016 --> 17:09.246
let me go! Don`t you know him?

17:14.815 --> 17:16.566
Do you know The Tapeworm?
- Do you want to suck my cock?

17:16.773 --> 17:19.242
No.
Do you know where The Tapeworm is?

17:20.453 --> 17:22.489
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?

17:22.693 --> 17:24.842
Do you want to suck my dick?

17:25.051 --> 17:28.361
Come back. You want to fuck?

17:29.251 --> 17:33.004
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?
He`s here often.

17:33.210 --> 17:35.440
Maybe upstairs.

17:38.849 --> 17:42.318
The Tapeworm...
Are you The Tapeworm?

17:46.487 --> 17:49.206
Let me go.
Do you know The Tapeworm?

17:52.366 --> 17:55.880
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?
He`s here often. - Doesn`t ring a bell.

17:56.085 --> 17:58.474
Do you work here often?
- Yes, but it doesn`t ring a bell.

17:58.685 --> 18:02.563
Don`t you know him either?
- Search. You won`t find him far from here.

18:28.238 --> 18:30.751
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?

18:33.756 --> 18:36.429
The Tapeworm? No.

18:44.954 --> 18:48.423
Do you know a guy named The Tapeworm?

18:49.793 --> 18:53.148
Do you know The Tapeworm?
- I have him in my stomach.

18:59.271 --> 19:02.182
Do you know The Tapeworm?

19:06.869 --> 19:09.826
You there. Do you know The Tapeworm?

19:10.028 --> 19:12.667
Yes, he`s my pal.
- You know him?

19:12.867 --> 19:16.496
He`s my friend, I said.
- Where is he?

19:16.707 --> 19:19.095
Take me to him.
- He`s fucking a fag.

19:19.306 --> 19:22.934
Forget The Tapeworm. Fist me.
- Don`t touch me.

19:23.145 --> 19:26.853
Come on fist me.
- Keep your hands off me.

19:27.064 --> 19:30.260
Shut up. Take me to him.
- Fist me.

19:30.463 --> 19:32.374
Fist me then!
- Take me to him.

19:32.583 --> 19:34.414
Fist me! What kind of guy are you?

19:34.622 --> 19:36.692
Keep quiet! I`m not a fag.

19:36.902 --> 19:40.530
Where is he? Come on.
- I`ll take you to The Tapeworm.

19:40.741 --> 19:43.971
Take me to him!
- Two hands up your ass!

19:44.340 --> 19:46.900
Stop it.

19:47.100 --> 19:49.488
Are you sure you want
to see The Tapeworm?

19:49.699 --> 19:52.974
Fist me, that`s much better.

19:57.337 --> 20:00.965
Are you sure you want to see
him? Fisting me is much better.

20:02.336 --> 20:06.123
I like you.
You make me think about someone else.

20:06.335 --> 20:11.010
Take me to him, I said.
Take it easy.

20:11.214 --> 20:13.807
Take me to him. Where is he?

20:14.013 --> 20:17.244
Give me a drink.
- Give him a drink.

20:17.453 --> 20:19.807
Drink! Where is he?

20:20.012 --> 20:22.082
One Pepsi.
- Where is he?

20:22.291 --> 20:26.886
The Tapeworm? In your ass.
The Tapeworm is in your ass. You know?

20:41.647 --> 20:45.559
You want my fist against your yaw,
fucking fag?

20:45.766 --> 20:48.518
Where is he? I know him.

20:48.725 --> 20:51.523
I know him. Bring me to him.

20:51.725 --> 20:54.955
Damned parachutist.
- Take me to him.

20:55.164 --> 20:59.122
You should fuck their brains out.
Show them you`re a hero.

20:59.723 --> 21:02.953
Dammit, is that what you want?
Take me to him.

21:03.162 --> 21:05.880
Take me to him!
- I confess!

21:06.081 --> 21:08.151
Take me to him!
- I confess!

21:08.361 --> 21:11.033
Take me to him!
- I confess, dammit!

21:12.560 --> 21:16.029
Go on! Go on!
Where is he?

21:17.359 --> 21:20.953
Hurry up dammit!
- The Tapeworm is dangerous.

21:22.958 --> 21:25.869
Are you sure you want to see
The Tapeworm?

21:28.436 --> 21:31.587
Hit me one more time.

21:31.796 --> 21:33.592
Where is he?
- There he is.

21:33.795 --> 21:35.513
Fuck off.

21:36.714 --> 21:39.274
What`s happening?
- Who`s The Tapeworm here?

21:39.474 --> 21:42.943
Are you The Tapeworm?
I asked you something.

21:44.393 --> 21:46.462
Who`s The Tapeworm?

21:46.672 --> 21:49.424
Who`s The Tapeworm?

21:51.151 --> 21:54.381
Who`s The Tapeworm?
I asked you something. Gone with that.

21:54.590 --> 21:56.421
Who`s The Tapeworm?
You know him?

21:56.630 --> 21:58.426
Who`s The Tapeworm?

21:58.629 --> 22:01.587
Who?
- What do you want from The Tapeworm?

22:01.789 --> 22:05.258
I´m looking for him.
Are you The Tapeworm perhaps?

22:05.468 --> 22:07.344
Are you him?

22:18.865 --> 22:22.823
Come on, fuck him! Fuck him!

22:36.501 --> 22:38.411
Stop it!

22:40.260 --> 22:41.977
Fucking fag!

22:59.735 --> 23:01.851
Fucking fag!

23:10.333 --> 23:12.368
Stop it!

23:35.207 --> 23:38.721
Nice work. Good.

25:00.787 --> 25:02.300
Fucking slit-eye.

25:02.507 --> 25:06.101
Quit your insanity.
- We`re getting near.

25:06.306 --> 25:08.342
Stop it.
- Wait, I`m asking.

25:08.546 --> 25:10.979
Well, I`m waiting.

25:18.103 --> 25:20.936
Where`s the Rectum?
- Which Rectum?

25:21.143 --> 25:24.896
A fag bar.
- Do you need one?

25:25.102 --> 25:26.535
Is it a whore bar?

25:26.742 --> 25:29.460
Do you want my cock up your rectum?

25:29.661 --> 25:32.618
Don´t you know The Rectum?
- I only know this here.

25:32.820 --> 25:34.412
Aren`t you a fag?

25:34.620 --> 25:36.769
Where`s The Rectum?

25:37.819 --> 25:39.968
What are you doing?

25:56.735 --> 25:59.168
What are you doing?
- Who are you going to hit now?

25:59.374 --> 26:02.171
Come on.
- Yes, I have nothing else to do.

26:03.813 --> 26:05.769
Do you know a place that...

26:06.212 --> 26:09.249
The Rectum, do you know it?

26:12.771 --> 26:15.238
The Rectum, a gay bar.
You know it?

26:15.450 --> 26:17.725
That way, I think.
- There?

26:17.930 --> 26:20.807
It`s over there! Come on!

26:22.169 --> 26:25.638
What are you doing? Come on!

26:26.728 --> 26:29.036
We`re close!

26:31.407 --> 26:34.478
Are you coming?

26:35.606 --> 26:38.073
Come on!
- Stop it!

26:40.884 --> 26:43.239
Are you being pussy too now?

26:43.444 --> 26:47.152
You`re crazy!
- We´re going to The rectum! Come on!

26:51.482 --> 26:53.393
Hurry up.

27:05.599 --> 27:07.190
Drive!

27:07.398 --> 27:10.117
Who`s followinf you?
- Drive, I said!

27:10.318 --> 27:12.387
Are the whore`s after you?

27:12.597 --> 27:14.189
You`re not even telling where to,

27:14.397 --> 27:18.389
We`re going to The Rectum!
- The Rectum! That`s clear.

27:18.596 --> 27:20.870
Everyone knows where The rectum is.

27:21.075 --> 27:23.987
Could you show the way, please?

27:24.194 --> 27:25.866
It`s a gay bar.

27:26.074 --> 27:29.952
If you took care of Alex with that much
energy, nothing would have happened.

27:30.153 --> 27:34.304
Picture that with your little
brain, moron.

27:34.512 --> 27:36.901
With your damned inhibitions!

27:37.351 --> 27:39.819
Are you done preaching?
The Rectum is a gay bar.

27:40.031 --> 27:42.225
Could you point it
out on a map?

27:42.430 --> 27:45.103
It`s a fag bar.
Do you know what that is?

27:45.310 --> 27:49.018
Are you gay?
- No! I`m looking for a gay bar.

27:49.229 --> 27:51.298
Don`t you know some bars?

27:51.508 --> 27:54.897
A lot.
- Well, take us to a gay bar.

27:55.107 --> 27:58.463
You are gay.
- No! And now shut up.

27:58.667 --> 28:01.578
Be quiet now and
leave me alone.

28:01.786 --> 28:04.140
Sorry, sir.
- Take us to The Rectum.

28:04.345 --> 28:08.496
Take it easy, marcus.
I`m going crazy here.

28:08.704 --> 28:10.456
I don`t know a Rectum.

28:10.664 --> 28:12.972
Don`t you have a phone?
Cal then!

28:13.183 --> 28:15.458
Don`t you have
slit-eye friends?

28:15.663 --> 28:18.096
Don`t insult me
or I will beat you up.

28:18.302 --> 28:19.655
Bring me to The Rectum.

28:19.862 --> 28:23.820
I will beat him up too, sir.
Don`t take it ill of him.

28:24.021 --> 28:26.215
He`s crazy. It`s a moron.
- Doesn`t matter.

28:26.420 --> 28:29.616
Okay, take it easy. Easy.

28:29.819 --> 28:32.538
One bar with guys.
- Guys?

28:32.739 --> 28:37.095
Try to get your brain working,
fucking asshole.

28:37.298 --> 28:39.970
Take me to The Rectum.
- Get out now.

28:40.177 --> 28:42.327
Shut up and get out.

28:42.536 --> 28:45.573
Just try to get me
out, fucker.

28:45.776 --> 28:48.084
Get out, please.
I am fed up with it.

28:48.295 --> 28:52.003
Alex would be ashamed.
- Get out now. Hurry.

28:52.214 --> 28:55.365
Take it easy, we`re getting out.

28:55.573 --> 28:58.133
get out, I said! Get out!

28:59.453 --> 29:02.171
What do you want
with that pepperspray?

29:02.372 --> 29:05.966
Filthy asshole!
- Get out!

29:06.171 --> 29:10.641
Stop it! Get out, please.
I am fed up with it.

29:10.850 --> 29:13.158
How much do I owe you?

29:13.369 --> 29:17.407
Stop it, Marcus!
Fucking stop it!

29:26.526 --> 29:28.482
Fuck off!

29:28.846 --> 29:30.563
Fuck off! Go on!
- My taxi!

29:30.765 --> 29:34.360
You`re crazy! Stupid fucker!

29:34.565 --> 29:35.997
Drop dead, filthy Chinese.

29:36.204 --> 29:40.162
You`re insane!
- We`re going to The Rectum.

29:52.440 --> 29:54.908
Stop it now with
your stupid revenge.

29:55.120 --> 29:58.031
We`ll pay, we´ll pay.
- Only whore´s are here.

29:58.239 --> 30:00.389
It`s the whore street.
They don´t know anything else.

30:00.599 --> 30:04.557
That´s not your business.
- Stop it! Why, not my business?

30:04.758 --> 30:08.147
Stop it! What, did you want to hit me?

30:08.357 --> 30:12.474
Don´t stay here.
We will give you money.

30:12.676 --> 30:13.994
We´re going to Alex
in the hospital.

30:14.195 --> 30:16.789
Which girl do you know?

30:16.995 --> 30:21.067
What do you want to do?
Being more stupid than...

30:21.274 --> 30:22.991
You don´t know who it was.

30:23.193 --> 30:24.831
Don´t you want to know?

30:25.033 --> 30:29.708
Nobody knows who it is.
And you´re not helping Alex with that.

30:29.912 --> 30:32.584
I will give you money.
- Well, who do you know?

30:32.791 --> 30:36.339
It´s a bit further.
- What will you get with anger?

30:36.550 --> 30:39.269
What kind of crazy
revenge is this?

30:39.470 --> 30:42.188
Come to Alex
in the hospital.

30:42.389 --> 30:46.461
You want to hit me? Is that it?
What´s wrong with you dammit?

30:46.668 --> 30:49.943
Then go to the hospital.

30:50.147 --> 30:54.185
You know those two?
- Ask those whores.

30:54.386 --> 30:55.865
What´s his name?
- Guillermo Nuñez.

30:56.066 --> 30:58.533
Do you know Guillermo Nuñez?

30:59.305 --> 31:00.533
What?

31:01.185 --> 31:03.175
What does she say?
- Ask the other one.

31:03.384 --> 31:06.659
Donna, I know her.
I meant her.

31:09.183 --> 31:12.811
We deliver better work
than the cops.

31:13.022 --> 31:15.296
Drunkards with a gun.
Zuipschuiten met 'n pistool.

31:15.501 --> 31:17.173
The police, they are morons.
De politie, dat zijn eikels.

31:17.381 --> 31:19.211
What do you know, teacher?

31:19.420 --> 31:22.457
The human stupidity,
that´s what I know. In a mass.

31:22.660 --> 31:25.617
Which one is it?
- There.

31:25.819 --> 31:27.298
She?
- Donna!

31:27.499 --> 31:30.012
Stop it!
- I didn´t do anything!

31:30.218 --> 31:32.970
Do you know Guillermo Nuñez?
- No.

31:33.177 --> 31:34.610
you don´t know Guillermo Nuñez?

31:34.817 --> 31:36.613
He´s my friend.
- You don´t know him?

31:36.816 --> 31:38.886
Nobody knows Guillermo Nuñez.

31:39.096 --> 31:41.211
Who is it? Tell me.

31:42.975 --> 31:45.204
What does she say? Concha?
The blonde?

31:45.414 --> 31:47.450
Thank you, Donna.

31:50.133 --> 31:53.648
Concha, are you Concha?

31:53.853 --> 31:55.729
Do you know Guillermo Nuñez?

31:55.932 --> 31:57.570
Do you know Guillermo Nuñez?

31:57.772 --> 32:00.331
Keep your hands off her.
Leave her alone.

32:00.531 --> 32:02.123
We won´t do her anything.

32:02.331 --> 32:04.400
Marcus, she didn´t do anything.

32:04.610 --> 32:07.442
Who do you think we are?
- Fuck off.

32:14.688 --> 32:17.759
Are you crazy, Marcus?

32:18.167 --> 32:20.316
Answer me!
It´s about a rape.

32:20.526 --> 32:22.164
Please!
- Rape, you hear?

32:22.366 --> 32:24.925
Marcus, please!
- Rape!

32:25.125 --> 32:28.197
Are you totally?
- Easy now.

32:28.405 --> 32:31.441
Leave her alone
or I won´t pay.

32:33.563 --> 32:37.192
Take it easy. Stop it, stop it.

32:39.282 --> 32:41.557
Let go!
- I will push!

32:41.761 --> 32:45.993
Come on, dammit. Alex...
- Tell him to stop,

32:46.200 --> 32:48.953
Stop it now, Marcus. Please.

32:49.160 --> 32:52.151
Are you crazy?
You´re fucking insane!

32:52.359 --> 32:55.236
Do you know Guillermo Nuñez?
Tell me.

32:56.798 --> 32:58.914
Who is Guillermo Nuñez?

32:59.117 --> 33:01.870
Who is Jo? I don´t know a Jo.
- I am Guillemo.

33:03.437 --> 33:05.825
lk ben Guillermo.

33:06.036 --> 33:08.549
You have become a transvestite,
great.

33:08.755 --> 33:12.269
I will pay you now.
- That will tell she was there.

33:12.474 --> 33:15.147
No.
- Did you see it?

33:15.354 --> 33:17.662
Pick up! Go on.

33:17.873 --> 33:20.307
Stop it, Marcus.
- What did you see?

33:20.513 --> 33:24.346
Cut out her eye.
- Come on, stab!

33:24.552 --> 33:26.906
Fuck off, you.
- Tell me.

33:29.031 --> 33:30.986
It´s The Tapeworm. I know him.

33:31.190 --> 33:32.589
The Tapeworm is a pimp.

33:32.790 --> 33:35.223
Where can we find him?

33:35.429 --> 33:38.068
Where? I will rebuild
your transvestite face.

33:38.268 --> 33:41.021
Where is he?
- Where can I find him?

33:42.627 --> 33:44.663
What´s the name of that club?
- Rectum.

33:44.867 --> 33:47.744
A Tapeworm in The Rectum?
Are you playing me?

33:47.946 --> 33:51.143
It´s a nightclub
for gays.

34:01.143 --> 34:03.418
There´s a taxi!

34:03.903 --> 34:05.574
Taxi!

34:23.418 --> 34:25.454
Did you use alcohol?

34:25.938 --> 34:28.292
No. No drugs either?

34:29.737 --> 34:31.454
No drugs?

34:31.656 --> 34:34.295
But according to your
so-called colleague...

34:34.496 --> 34:37.726
you used drugs regulary.

34:38.014 --> 34:40.891
He can say whatever he wants.
- Is it true or not?

34:41.094 --> 34:43.085
I didn´t use anything.

34:43.293 --> 34:45.090
And the victim?

34:45.293 --> 34:48.967
I don´t know.
- No? Didn´t you live together?

34:50.452 --> 34:52.407
Did you live together?

34:53.331 --> 34:55.242
Don´t you want to answer?

34:56.011 --> 34:58.604
You don´t make it easy for us.

35:00.490 --> 35:03.686
Did you leave before
or after the victim?

35:05.568 --> 35:08.958
Pull yourself together.
- After, after.

35:09.168 --> 35:11.840
After? how much after?
- 15 minutes.

35:12.047 --> 35:14.241
Now that´s an answer.

35:14.966 --> 35:16.479
15 minutes.

35:16.686 --> 35:19.995
And when did Mr. Marcus
go outside?

35:21.125 --> 35:23.274
He came in the alley with me.

35:23.484 --> 35:25.554
He came in the alley with you.

35:25.764 --> 35:28.038
Did he leave sometime
earlier in the evening?

35:28.443 --> 35:30.957
I don´t know.
- You don´t know?

35:32.762 --> 35:34.559
Did you notice
something special?

35:34.762 --> 35:38.390
Were there people
around the victim?

35:38.601 --> 35:42.229
Did she talk to certain people?
Did she have a fight with someone?

35:42.440 --> 35:45.829
No? With you maybe?

35:47.359 --> 35:49.474
With Mr. Marcus?

35:49.878 --> 35:53.313
And didn´t you have
a fight with Marcus?

35:55.237 --> 35:57.796
You didn´t have a
fight with Mr. Marcus?

36:00.156 --> 36:04.512
I will need a phone number
where I can reach you.

36:05.435 --> 36:07.265
I´m listening

36:07.554 --> 36:12.547
01 ... 44... 76... 12... 26.

36:12.753 --> 36:16.381
Good. Is that your private number?

36:17.392 --> 36:20.110
Is it your private number?

36:20.311 --> 36:22.108
Give him back his papers.

36:22.311 --> 36:23.709
Take your papers back.

36:23.910 --> 36:25.059
Take your papers.

36:25.270 --> 36:28.625
I will contact you when
I need you. You may go.

36:28.869 --> 36:32.861
Go ahead, it´s allright.
You may go.

36:55.783 --> 36:58.774
Good evening.
Are you allright?

37:02.302 --> 37:06.419
The woman who was attacked...
is she someone you know?

37:09.180 --> 37:12.091
You don´t feel very good, huh?
It´s tough.

37:12.539 --> 37:16.497
You always think it only happens
to other people, but if it happens to you,

37:16.698 --> 37:18.450
you are helplessly lost.

37:20.657 --> 37:22.932
Are you counting on the cops?

37:23.337 --> 37:27.534
What do you think the police
will do? Nothing, and you know that.

37:28.895 --> 37:31.614
Will they find the perpetrator?

37:31.815 --> 37:33.611
Will they put him in jail?

37:33.814 --> 37:36.886
Will they give him food and clothes?
Will they wash him?

37:37.094 --> 37:38.890
Will they give him a doctor?

37:39.093 --> 37:41.970
Your girlfriend didn´t
get a doctor.

37:42.292 --> 37:43.566
Who are you?

37:43.772 --> 37:46.444
Who I am?
As a matter of fact...

37:46.651 --> 37:48.721
I could become your best friend.

37:49.251 --> 37:51.810
I can help you find the perpetrator.

37:52.890 --> 37:56.438
You look honest.
Nicely dressed.

37:56.649 --> 37:58.799
Obviously you have money.

37:59.169 --> 38:03.320
If you have some money, we could
help you get revenge.

38:03.887 --> 38:07.721
The perpetrator spilled blood.
Blood shouts for revenge.

38:08.366 --> 38:10.675
Revenge is a human right.

38:11.526 --> 38:13.561
Laïd, come over.

38:14.045 --> 38:17.161
You understand it right away.
Explain who we are.

38:17.364 --> 38:19.195
This here is our neighbourhood.

38:19.404 --> 38:23.191
We find everyone, faster than
the morons over there.

38:23.403 --> 38:25.200
Exactly.
- Listen to him.

38:25.402 --> 38:29.952
Not very long ago someone
was raped here.

38:30.761 --> 38:33.229
We have found the perpetrator.

38:33.521 --> 38:36.671
We made him clear not to
do it again.

38:38.360 --> 38:40.270
Do you want revenge or not?

38:40.479 --> 38:43.197
Or do you want him to go to prison?

38:44.238 --> 38:45.466
You hesitate?
- Do you know him?

38:45.678 --> 38:49.716
Ofcourse. We found a hand bag
with identity.

38:50.357 --> 38:53.189
The name was Guillermo Nuñez.

38:53.396 --> 38:56.432
Are you in?
Pay and we deliver him.

38:56.635 --> 39:00.513
You shouldn´t hesitate.
You´re hurting yourself.

39:00.714 --> 39:04.024
What´s wrong? You´re shivering.

39:04.234 --> 39:08.385
This is only for men.
Don´t be a pussy. Okay?

39:08.633 --> 39:11.783
Are you in or not?
Man yourself.

39:11.992 --> 39:13.549
Take me with you.
- Are you in?

39:13.751 --> 39:16.709
We´ll leave the cops for what they are.
- Come.

39:21.150 --> 39:23.026
Go home then.
- You don´t realize your luck.

39:23.229 --> 39:25.823
Shall I...
- You´re ruining it with Alex.

39:26.029 --> 39:27.984
I´ll give you money for a taxi.

39:28.188 --> 39:30.860
You´re ruining the party
the whole evening.

39:32.907 --> 39:35.704
What´s happening?
- A whore got raped.

39:35.906 --> 39:37.737
You won´t get through
- We want a taxi.

39:37.946 --> 39:39.742
No, gentlemen.
- We only want a taxi.

39:39.945 --> 39:41.617
No, gentlemen.
- Don´t act so stupid.

39:41.825 --> 39:44.019
Something happened,
the street is blocked.

39:45.104 --> 39:46.742
Alex!

39:52.502 --> 39:54.140
Wait!

39:57.061 --> 40:00.053
Alex! What happened?

40:00.261 --> 40:03.411
Sir, take it easy.
- What happened?

40:03.620 --> 40:07.771
She has been raped and is in a coma now.
Sir, please.

40:07.979 --> 40:10.856
Let us do our work, sir.

40:14.897 --> 40:18.094
Sir, take it easy.
Just let us do our work.

40:18.297 --> 40:21.447
Take him away.
- Sir, please.

40:21.656 --> 40:24.886
We can´t work like that.
- Take him away.

40:29.454 --> 40:31.489
Who are you, sir?

40:34.813 --> 40:38.566
Is she your wife?
- Do you know that man?

40:39.212 --> 40:41.850
I will have to ask you some questions.
Who are you?

40:42.051 --> 40:44.485
She´s my wife.
- Do you know that man?

40:44.970 --> 40:47.438
Sir, please.
- She is my wife.

40:47.650 --> 40:49.799
Keep him on a distance.

41:32.879 --> 41:36.554
It´s dangerous.
Please go around the tunnel.

41:36.758 --> 41:38.714
Thank you.

42:49.982 --> 42:52.415
Here! Filthy bitch.

42:59.659 --> 43:03.936
Filthy bitch, you´re dead.
Hold on, you.

43:05.538 --> 43:08.006
Wait!

43:09.657 --> 43:12.171
Wait!
- Leave me alone.

43:12.377 --> 43:14.128
Wait, I said.

43:17.695 --> 43:21.085
Would you just shut up?
I won´t do you anything.

43:21.694 --> 43:24.003
Shut your fucking mouth.

43:25.374 --> 43:28.092
You want to taste this?

43:29.293 --> 43:31.362
Will you shut up now?

43:37.051 --> 43:40.201
Fucking bitch.

43:42.090 --> 43:44.922
Shall I give you a pretty smile?

43:45.409 --> 43:48.206
Fucking whore.

43:48.488 --> 43:52.560
Does that excite you?
Tell me.

43:53.487 --> 43:55.045
Does it make you horney?

44:00.485 --> 44:02.760
Well, well.

44:05.924 --> 44:08.916
You are pretty hot.

44:11.283 --> 44:13.921
Please...
- Shut up.

44:14.162 --> 44:17.234
Leave me alone
- Shut up, I said.

44:17.801 --> 44:19.154
Lift up your skirt.

44:19.361 --> 44:21.591
Leave me alone.
- Lift up your skirt.

44:21.801 --> 44:23.711
Shut up.

44:26.359 --> 44:29.237
Dammit.
- Leave me alone, please.

44:31.958 --> 44:33.914
Please.

44:38.077 --> 44:41.352
Go sit on your knees.
On your knees!

44:42.596 --> 44:46.508
On your knees! I´m going
to fuck you . On your knees!

44:47.995 --> 44:49.507
And now lie down.

44:57.192 --> 44:58.705
Lie down.

45:00.272 --> 45:01.943
Shut up.

45:06.110 --> 45:09.341
Well, well.

45:09.550 --> 45:11.983
You have a nice ass.

45:12.189 --> 45:14.907
I´m going to fuck you, whore.

45:20.107 --> 45:23.985
Who pays for your clothes?
Your guy?

45:24.186 --> 45:27.098
What an asshole that he lets
you walk around like this outside.

45:27.305 --> 45:29.261
You little whore.

45:32.944 --> 45:36.379
Shut up!
Shut up or I´ll kill you.

45:36.583 --> 45:39.336
Understand?
Shut up or I´ll kill you.

45:43.382 --> 45:44.939
Dammit!

45:49.820 --> 45:53.892
Open your legs! Open your legs!
Open your legs, dammit!

45:59.578 --> 46:02.728
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up!

46:02.937 --> 46:07.134
Lay still... Don´t move.
I´m going to fuck you in your ass.

46:07.336 --> 46:09.167
I will fuck your ass untill it bleeds!

46:09.376 --> 46:12.447
I will fuck your ass like
you have never fucked.

46:12.655 --> 46:17.205
You little whore.
Don´t move.

46:17.934 --> 46:21.403
You´ve been fucked
in your ass before, huh?

46:21.613 --> 46:25.810
Does your guy do it in your ass?
Do you like it?

46:29.851 --> 46:31.569
Dammit.

46:32.251 --> 46:34.923
Don´t move, dammit!

46:36.010 --> 46:38.807
Lay still, don´t move.

46:39.369 --> 46:42.519
Don´t move, don´t move.

46:45.248 --> 46:47.602
Don´t move, dammit!

47:02.444 --> 47:04.354
Dammit!

47:04.563 --> 47:07.759
You have a nice tight ass.

47:07.962 --> 47:10.999
I will fuck your ass untill it bleeds!

47:11.202 --> 47:15.752
If you dare to shit,
you die. Understand?

47:24.798 --> 47:27.517
Fucking bitch.

47:50.832 --> 47:54.029
You have such a tight ass.

47:54.232 --> 47:57.701
A nice fag ass.

47:58.151 --> 48:00.710
Usually I don´t like that.

48:00.910 --> 48:04.379
Bitch. But this time...

48:15.147 --> 48:18.741
Will you shut up already?

48:33.023 --> 48:36.378
Whore! in your ass!

48:36.782 --> 48:39.853
You´ve never been fucked in
your ass like this, huh?

48:43.500 --> 48:47.333
Dammit, is that blood or cum?

48:47.539 --> 48:50.656
Your ass is getting bigger, huh?
Are you bleeding?

48:52.218 --> 48:54.129
Dammit.

49:02.696 --> 49:05.528
Oh yeah, nice.

49:09.294 --> 49:12.286
Damn, that´s nice.

49:15.053 --> 49:17.283
Tell your daddy it´s nice.

49:17.892 --> 49:20.008
Tell daddy it´s nice.

49:20.212 --> 49:22.486
Say daddy to me.
Say daddy.

49:22.691 --> 49:26.047
Say daddy, bitch!

50:03.162 --> 50:05.118
Shut up!

50:49.671 --> 50:51.309
Dammit.

51:24.823 --> 51:28.701
Dammit.... God damnit

51:31.782 --> 51:33.578
Good.

51:56.056 --> 51:57.967
That was nice.

52:15.732 --> 52:17.722
Where are you going, bitch?

52:19.051 --> 52:20.688
Where are you going?

52:22.530 --> 52:24.521
Where are you going like that?

52:31.888 --> 52:35.197
Did you think I was
done with you?

52:36.607 --> 52:39.404
Little whore.
Look at me.

52:41.086 --> 52:43.041
Look at me when
I´m talking to you.

52:43.885 --> 52:45.523
Look at me, dammit.

52:45.725 --> 52:48.397
Filthy bitch, look at me.

52:51.323 --> 52:55.202
Little whore. Fucking bitch.

52:55.402 --> 52:56.630
Come here!

52:58.602 --> 53:01.957
Ugly bitch!
Bitch!

53:04.960 --> 53:07.269
You think you can do anything, huh?

53:07.480 --> 53:10.551
You think you can do anything
because you're beautiful, huh?

53:11.639 --> 53:15.551
Dirty cunt! Dirty...
Come here!

53:16.398 --> 53:19.912
I'm gonna hit your face real hard!

53:20.117 --> 53:22.391
I'm not finished with you!

53:22.596 --> 53:25.554
Come here! Here! Here!

53:27.595 --> 53:30.950
Fucking bitch! Here!

53:33.434 --> 53:36.823
Are you happy now? Or do you want
some more?

53:37.033 --> 53:40.581
Want some? Fucking whore!
Please!

53:40.792 --> 53:42.942
Little cunt, that you are!
Over here!

53:43.151 --> 53:45.711
This is for your rotten face!

53:54.589 --> 53:59.025
Now I'm all finished with you.
Fucking cunt.

54:07.306 --> 54:09.341
What do you want to say to me?

54:09.545 --> 54:12.503
You do not care about my
sexuality.

54:12.705 --> 54:16.492
But you engage me in it.
-You never talk about yours.

54:16.704 --> 54:18.375
Because there is nothing to tell.

54:18.583 --> 54:20.733
What is it then?
-There is always something.

54:20.943 --> 54:23.297
What are you doing with your dick?

54:23.502 --> 54:25.936
Don't bitch about it.
-Are you gonna keep it to wanking?

54:26.142 --> 54:29.975
Don't be like that. I think about
Alex and you, and that's painful.

54:30.181 --> 54:32.978
You are alone for 3 years now.
-So what?

54:33.180 --> 54:34.898
What do you do?

54:35.100 --> 54:39.490
You are sent by God,
because my pal Pierre...

54:39.698 --> 54:41.290
has a problem.
-What about it?

54:41.498 --> 54:45.536
We must find a way to losen

54:45.737 --> 54:48.012
Pierre a bit up.

54:48.217 --> 54:51.811
I want to take care of that.
-You see...but how?

54:52.016 --> 54:55.371
You are with two
and I'm not alone either.

54:55.575 --> 54:57.929
In the toilets.
-Now shut up.

54:58.134 --> 55:00.409
That's where it happens all the time.
-Alex is alone.

55:00.614 --> 55:02.683
Come on.
-Go, Pierre.

55:02.893 --> 55:06.965
You are saying that I bitch about
your sexuality, and what about you?

55:11.171 --> 55:14.049
Are you afraid?
-Pierre is very nice.

55:14.251 --> 55:17.959
Forget it. I know how it goes.
We make fun,

55:18.170 --> 55:19.568
we get completly stoned...

55:19.769 --> 55:23.727
but I did that 15 years, 30 years ago.

55:24.008 --> 55:26.078
Hello.
-Don't do that.

55:26.288 --> 55:29.563
Stop it, Marcus.
Leave me alone.

55:29.767 --> 55:33.645
You can't do that to Alex.
Leave Fatima alone.

55:33.846 --> 55:36.200
Fatima, come on.

55:36.405 --> 55:39.875
Don't do it. You are going to regret
if you sober up.

55:40.085 --> 55:43.360
Forget about it. Come on.
Go with me.

55:43.564 --> 55:46.361
He's very nice.
First a present.

55:46.563 --> 55:50.077
Don't do that shit.
Leave it.

55:50.282 --> 55:52.318
Stop it, Pierre.

55:52.522 --> 55:54.910
Stop it. Don't do it.

55:55.121 --> 55:57.476
You are a pain in the ass.

56:13.997 --> 56:15.793
And, girls?

56:16.556 --> 56:17.909
Delicious.

56:18.116 --> 56:19.833
I got to go see Pierre

56:20.035 --> 56:22.674
who only loves rats and
may not be left alone.

56:22.875 --> 56:23.864
Are you coming back?

56:24.074 --> 56:25.905
Soon?
-Yeah. Thanks, girls.

56:26.114 --> 56:28.422
Are you going to leave us alone?

56:44.910 --> 56:47.184
This is Pierre
and he needs your love.

56:47.389 --> 56:50.266
Alex is dancing all alone.
Don't be an moron.

56:50.468 --> 56:53.938
Give him some pleasure, ladies.
-Piss off.

56:54.148 --> 56:57.935
You are saying that I bitch about
your sexuality and what do you do?

57:04.985 --> 57:09.421
I know. Come on, Marcus.
I really hate it when you act like that.

57:09.624 --> 57:13.502
If you are not doing it for me,
then do it for her.

57:13.703 --> 57:15.375
No, Marcus stays here.

57:15.583 --> 57:20.178
Come on. Don't be such an idiot.

57:21.101 --> 57:24.889
Alex has to dance all by himself.
Come on.

57:25.100 --> 57:26.374
Leave him.

57:26.580 --> 57:29.491
Here I am!
-Come on.

57:29.699 --> 57:33.737
Marcus, you are fantastic.
-It's rotten, Marcus.

57:33.938 --> 57:35.496
That's life, mate.

57:35.698 --> 57:38.894
Then it didn't have any sense
to bring her along.

57:43.856 --> 57:46.495
Why did you bring her if you
are doing it that way?

57:46.695 --> 57:49.163
Why are you doing it that way?
Come on, have a drink.

57:49.375 --> 57:51.763
You are in need of a glass of water

57:52.414 --> 57:53.893
You don't have to act like that.

57:54.094 --> 57:56.653
You take her with you and...
-Look at the ladies.

57:56.853 --> 57:59.969
You can be a dickhead
without being with her too.

58:00.172 --> 58:02.049
Stay with her.

58:02.252 --> 58:04.321
You need to have some fun.
-Do you call this fun?

58:04.531 --> 58:07.523
Yes, this is fun.
You are just like a priest.

58:07.731 --> 58:09.880
I feel like a nanny.
-Our little priest.

58:10.090 --> 58:13.445
I go with a teenager loaded
with drugs.

58:13.649 --> 58:16.117
Have some water. Come on.

58:16.329 --> 58:18.762
Have a drink.

58:18.968 --> 58:21.640
Here, drink the water. From the sink.

58:21.847 --> 58:24.805
Give me a shot of water from the sink.

58:25.007 --> 58:27.998
There was a queue at the john.
I couldn't piss.

58:28.206 --> 58:32.323
Stop it, Marcus.
-I opened the tap.

58:32.525 --> 58:35.561
Leave it.
-Come on, quit it.

58:35.764 --> 58:39.073
Quit it, Pierre.
Before you fuck up everything.

58:39.283 --> 58:41.353
Come on.
-You are not funny.

58:41.563 --> 58:45.157
It's not funny like that.
They'll see you.

58:45.362 --> 58:47.080
You are even more fierce then an animal.

58:47.282 --> 58:49.078
You are not funny.

59:20.874 --> 59:23.751
Did you come for that, dickhead?
-What, dickhead?

59:23.953 --> 59:26.750
I came to watch them dance,
therefore I'm a dickhead.

59:26.952 --> 59:29.341
Don't be like that, Marcus. Really.

59:29.552 --> 59:31.746
Look how beautiful she is.
Look how she dances.

59:31.951 --> 59:36.865
Look how gorgeous. Brunette,
blonde, brunette, blonde.

59:37.070 --> 59:40.425
Behave like an adult.
-We'll fuck'em all.

59:40.629 --> 59:43.189
Found your girlfriends?
-So?

59:43.389 --> 59:44.946
Hello.
- What's your name?

59:45.148 --> 59:47.104
Joanna. Is that you?
- Vincent.

59:47.308 --> 59:49.616
Hello, Vincent.
- No, my name is Marcus.

59:49.827 --> 59:51.055
And you?
- Aurèle.

59:51.267 --> 59:54.781
Aurèle? This is Alex.

59:55.746 --> 59:58.782
No, that's Alex.
- I know.

59:58.985 --> 01:00:02.021
I'm Marcus.
Marcus.

01:00:06.023 --> 01:00:09.220
Come on.
-I've had it with that cunt.

01:00:09.423 --> 01:00:12.619
Don't be so annoying.
-He brings misfortune.

01:00:12.822 --> 01:00:15.540
I give him some pussy.
He doesn't want them.

01:00:15.741 --> 01:00:17.140
I give him coke, he doesn't like it.

01:00:17.341 --> 01:00:20.218
I present him a glass, he says no.
Such a bore.

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:22.850
You picked a weird one as lean
as a lath, Alex.

01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:25.732
No, I rather watch you.

01:00:25.939 --> 01:00:28.293
I bear heavy secrets.
-Dance with me.

01:00:28.498 --> 01:00:31.092
Let me have a look at you.
You didn't use to dance.

01:00:31.298 --> 01:00:35.210
There is the hairy monkey.
Stop it, Marcus.

01:00:35.417 --> 01:00:37.532
Do something.
What has he swallowed?

01:00:37.736 --> 01:00:40.125
Stop it.

01:00:40.456 --> 01:00:42.571
In the past you never danced.
-I dance with you.

01:00:42.775 --> 01:00:46.403
You dance to forget, huh?
Your Marcus is out of his mind.

01:00:46.614 --> 01:00:49.889
What are you doing?
You didn't use to dance like that.

01:00:50.093 --> 01:00:52.687
In the past you didn't dance that way.

01:00:54.572 --> 01:00:57.803
Let yourself go.
-I'm completly relaxed.

01:00:58.012 --> 01:01:01.799
Dance with me.
-You scare me. You're never like this.

01:01:02.011 --> 01:01:04.808
I never saw you like this.
There you have got him again.

01:01:05.010 --> 01:01:08.001
Do I scare you?
-Funny, huh?

01:01:09.769 --> 01:01:13.078
Do you think that's funny?
I can do it too.

01:01:13.288 --> 01:01:16.836
Please. Dance with me.

01:01:17.047 --> 01:01:19.277
I'm with you. I look at you.

01:01:19.487 --> 01:01:23.195
You are in great shape.
Remember? Be careful.

01:01:24.325 --> 01:01:26.714
You are playing a dangerous game,
Alex.

01:01:27.205 --> 01:01:31.277
Marcus has a lot of fun.
-Come with me.

01:02:08.995 --> 01:02:12.145
Very nice to see you.
-The pleasure is all mine. How are you?

01:02:12.354 --> 01:02:14.151
I'm going to say hi to a few mates.

01:02:14.354 --> 01:02:16.947
Everything okay?
Sorry.

01:02:18.153 --> 01:02:19.711
Everything okay?

01:02:20.712 --> 01:02:22.145
How about you?

01:02:26.631 --> 01:02:28.940
And?
-And, does it grow?

01:02:29.151 --> 01:02:31.459
He never knows when to quit.

01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:34.183
I'm happy. You look hot.

01:02:34.389 --> 01:02:36.949
Quit it.

01:02:37.149 --> 01:02:39.662
I really enjoy it to see you

01:02:40.388 --> 01:02:43.140
I'm completly wasted from the dancing.

01:02:43.347 --> 01:02:45.622
I've also danced alot.
-Everything okay?

01:02:45.827 --> 01:02:49.535
I'm happy.
I'm in a very special period.

01:02:49.746 --> 01:02:52.657
I'll tell you about it.
I'm here with a guy.

01:02:52.865 --> 01:02:55.583
Pierre?
- No.

01:02:55.784 --> 01:02:59.379
I'm with Marcus.

01:03:00.223 --> 01:03:05.091
I think he's completely insane.
-Yeah, it looks like it.

01:03:05.302 --> 01:03:08.135
I want to have dinner with you
one evening.

01:03:08.342 --> 01:03:10.377
Thank you.
-Then I'll tell you all.

01:03:10.581 --> 01:03:12.219
She must tell me everything.

01:03:12.421 --> 01:03:15.014
What does she have to tell?
-I don't know.

01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:17.890
Are you alright?
-Yeah, of course.

01:03:19.259 --> 01:03:21.977
Okay. Will you call me?
-Promised.

01:03:22.178 --> 01:03:23.327
Well...

01:03:24.098 --> 01:03:26.372
See you later.

01:03:36.935 --> 01:03:39.448
Stop it.
- What?

01:03:43.493 --> 01:03:45.449
What did you take?

01:03:46.733 --> 01:03:49.485
Nothing. Nothing at all.

01:03:49.692 --> 01:03:53.923
I'm sober as water.
My name is Jean-François.

01:03:57.210 --> 01:04:00.327
Did you see your eyes?
-What's wrong with them?

01:04:00.530 --> 01:04:01.962
You don't control your mouth.

01:04:02.169 --> 01:04:04.922
You don't control your breasts.

01:04:06.088 --> 01:04:08.727
Quit it, I want to rest.
-I've been looking for you for a while.

01:04:08.928 --> 01:04:10.519
I was dancing.

01:04:10.727 --> 01:04:13.480
Why do you have to swallow pills
to make fun?

01:04:13.687 --> 01:04:17.838
I don't know. It's fun.
-You are no longer 15.

01:04:22.285 --> 01:04:25.242
Sometimes you can be very sweet...

01:04:25.444 --> 01:04:28.640
and soft, and at other moments
you can be a real moron.

01:04:28.843 --> 01:04:32.118
Quit it, Alex.
-I want to go home.

01:04:32.322 --> 01:04:36.030
I want to go home, I want some rest.

01:04:36.241 --> 01:04:39.472
I'll bring you home.
-You look like a ghost.

01:04:39.681 --> 01:04:42.513
Stop it, you are annoying me.
-Wait, I'll bring you home.

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:44.311
Don't touch me.

01:04:51.558 --> 01:04:52.990
Come on!

01:04:59.396 --> 01:05:02.432
I'll bring you home, I told you!

01:05:02.635 --> 01:05:04.830
Alex, goddammit!

01:05:37.267 --> 01:05:39.178
I'm leaving.
- Where are you going?

01:05:39.387 --> 01:05:41.741
I'm tired.
- But you're only here for an hour.

01:05:41.946 --> 01:05:44.255
I want to go home.
-A minute ago, you were still dancing.

01:05:44.466 --> 01:05:47.138
What's wrong?
-He's completely stoned.

01:05:47.345 --> 01:05:48.744
I know.
-Take care of him.

01:05:48.945 --> 01:05:51.583
He doesn't need me, you do.
-No I don't.

01:05:51.784 --> 01:05:54.058
Don't worry.
I'll call you tomorrow.

01:05:54.263 --> 01:05:57.061
No. I came for you.
To see you.

01:05:57.263 --> 01:06:01.175
It has been months. I have to make
up something to see you.

01:06:01.382 --> 01:06:04.293
To see you dance.
-Don't torture yourself like that.

01:06:04.501 --> 01:06:06.332
I don't.
I can take it.

01:06:06.541 --> 01:06:08.849
It's from esthetical pleasure.

01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:12.449
From nostalgia to see you again.
Don't go away.

01:06:12.659 --> 01:06:14.411
I'll call you tomorrow. Promised.

01:06:14.619 --> 01:06:16.336
Why?
-You are a darling.

01:06:16.538 --> 01:06:20.928
No, I'm not a darling. It's
uncareful to leave you alone.

01:06:27.136 --> 01:06:30.491
I'm reading a very good book.
-How long?

01:06:30.695 --> 01:06:32.969
Months.
-How many pages? 43?

01:06:33.174 --> 01:06:35.768
It's really good.

01:06:35.974 --> 01:06:38.043
After the index it's with each page...

01:06:38.253 --> 01:06:40.608
What's it about?
-Well, it says...

01:06:40.813 --> 01:06:43.531
The book?
-The book says...

01:06:44.572 --> 01:06:49.884
It seems to be that the future is completely
decided already. Everything is fixed.

01:06:50.650 --> 01:06:53.847
And the proof is the prophetic dreams.

01:06:54.050 --> 01:06:57.644
Beautiful. That gets us asleep
at least.

01:06:57.849 --> 01:07:01.761
Who knows what we are going to dream.
-You should write...

01:07:01.968 --> 01:07:04.845
Sometimes I dream that I'm asleep.
My only dream.

01:07:05.047 --> 01:07:06.799
Come on.
-Then you get relaxed.

01:07:07.007 --> 01:07:09.566
Very suspenseful.
-Direction Louis Blanc.

01:07:09.766 --> 01:07:13.804
Isn't that our stop?
-No, the next one.

01:07:14.605 --> 01:07:17.880
You have to sleep.
Do you sleep 2 hours?

01:07:18.084 --> 01:07:22.474
How many times did collapse,
after hours of work.

01:07:22.683 --> 01:07:24.639
Was it good? Tell me.

01:07:24.843 --> 01:07:26.798
You can't do it either, huh?
Terrible, huh?

01:07:27.002 --> 01:07:29.436
What will make you come?

01:07:29.641 --> 01:07:32.360
Stop it.
Why do you say something like that?

01:07:32.561 --> 01:07:34.755
It's your own fault, if you go out
with your ex boy-friends

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.439
You can't make her come, huh?

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:39.631
We'll explain it to you one time.
-No, seriously.

01:07:39.839 --> 01:07:42.478
What?
-Does he really make you come?

01:07:42.678 --> 01:07:45.988
I don't say...
-You don't have to say anything.

01:07:46.198 --> 01:07:50.190
Quit it. He with his monkey face.
Tell me.

01:07:50.397 --> 01:07:52.227
Come on.

01:07:52.436 --> 01:07:56.064
Don't be like that.
"Yes, we come."

01:07:56.275 --> 01:08:00.187
You see how you are now, Pierre?
You want to explain everything.

01:08:00.394 --> 01:08:04.023
Do you come or not?
I haven't been able to for years.

01:08:04.234 --> 01:08:06.189
Don't excite yourself.
Everything is fine.

01:08:06.393 --> 01:08:08.906
That's why you're in the back
and I'm up front.

01:08:10.592 --> 01:08:14.266
No, seriously. There is nobody.
-Stop it.

01:08:14.471 --> 01:08:17.304
Did he do something nice
or not?

01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:19.580
You don't talk about that stuff.

01:08:19.790 --> 01:08:21.745
Shall we do them then?
In turns.

01:08:21.948 --> 01:08:24.827
That way we'll see if it works on them.
-It's complicated.

01:08:25.029 --> 01:08:27.417
Did it work or not?
You held against me that...

01:08:27.627 --> 01:08:30.062
I've been thinking for a long time...
I had results.

01:08:30.466 --> 01:08:32.537
Excellent results, since...

01:08:32.747 --> 01:08:35.499
Can he do it?
-We're not talking about sex.

01:08:35.706 --> 01:08:39.095
Why not?
-You can talk about everything...

01:08:39.305 --> 01:08:41.738
We can talk about sex,
just not with you.

01:08:41.944 --> 01:08:45.653
He wants to explain everything.

01:08:45.863 --> 01:08:48.821
Like sex. Sex is an act, you
don't talk about it.

01:08:49.023 --> 01:08:51.935
But you can say how it is?

01:08:52.142 --> 01:08:54.814
Did you enjoy a bit,
yes or no?

01:08:55.022 --> 01:08:57.455
It's a vulgar question.
For me it was finished.

01:08:57.661 --> 01:09:00.857
Why do you say that?
- I had to, from my cardiologist.

01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:05.609
He said I would die from it.
"Her orgasm or your heart," she said.

01:09:05.819 --> 01:09:07.969
Seriously.
- Stop it now.

01:09:08.179 --> 01:09:12.011
there, a metro.
And it's blue with colors.

01:09:12.218 --> 01:09:13.776
Did you achieve something or not?

01:09:14.417 --> 01:09:16.169
Pierre!
- No, seriously.

01:09:16.377 --> 01:09:17.969
We will explain everything.

01:09:18.176 --> 01:09:20.246
Liar.

01:09:20.456 --> 01:09:22.810
Liars have a big nose,
you have big ears.

01:09:23.015 --> 01:09:26.609
Do I have a big nose?
- No, big ears. Your nose is nothing.

01:09:26.814 --> 01:09:28.930
By the way, with the wind... look.

01:09:30.214 --> 01:09:33.488
What an airflow.

01:09:35.252 --> 01:09:38.801
Ladies and gentlemen,
a couple that cums.

01:09:47.609 --> 01:09:49.167
One time...

01:09:49.729 --> 01:09:52.118
One time she screamed.
- In four years, very good.

01:09:52.328 --> 01:09:54.922
Because she bumped into
the pedestal.

01:09:55.128 --> 01:09:57.244
Why are you acting like that?

01:09:57.447 --> 01:09:59.358
The only tangible proof
of an orgasm.

01:09:59.567 --> 01:10:02.034
And I believed in it.
I thought: Finally.

01:10:02.246 --> 01:10:04.202
She cried. And it was bleeding.

01:10:04.406 --> 01:10:08.080
You know what people say?

01:10:08.285 --> 01:10:10.718
There are no women
who can't come,

01:10:10.924 --> 01:10:14.234
only men who can't fuck.

01:10:16.283 --> 01:10:18.592
And that's it.
-Why are you hurting yourself?

01:10:18.803 --> 01:10:22.192
I am not. Tell me the truth and
I swill accept it.

01:10:22.402 --> 01:10:25.040
I was too cerebral to
make her cum.

01:10:25.241 --> 01:10:29.597
Then she follows a diet of banana's
and testosteron, and it's done.

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:32.677
You are trite.
- Seriously.

01:10:32.879 --> 01:10:36.349
Do you do it for a banana diet?
Bravo.

01:10:36.558 --> 01:10:41.028
Look at that couple going to a party
who don't share their bed secrets.

01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:43.626
You have to be able to be tender.
- And you were so progressive.

01:10:43.837 --> 01:10:47.385
I'll write it down, you never know
if I find the one.

01:10:47.596 --> 01:10:51.270
It has been long that..
A knot, thank you.

01:10:51.475 --> 01:10:53.750
No, I kept it for you.

01:10:53.954 --> 01:10:57.663
How are those things called again?
Go on, tell me.

01:10:59.353 --> 01:11:02.345
A tender gesture.
- No, for you it's hopeless.

01:11:02.553 --> 01:11:05.350
You won't succeed anymore.
- Tell me.

01:11:05.552 --> 01:11:07.746
You take care of your rats.
You can still do that.

01:11:07.951 --> 01:11:10.340
I can't make them cum.
That's illegal.

01:11:10.551 --> 01:11:13.348
I'm going crazy
or I'll rape children.

01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:16.347
How do you do it?
- Don't make jokes about that.

01:11:16.549 --> 01:11:19.017
Alex, what was the problem?
- What do you think?

01:11:19.229 --> 01:11:22.698
His onomatopoeia?
His skin? His smell?

01:11:22.908 --> 01:11:24.863
Or was it the tarzan yell?

01:11:25.067 --> 01:11:27.820
Unimaginable.

01:11:29.066 --> 01:11:31.899
You're saying I'm too intellectual.
Now I'm asking for something simple.

01:11:32.106 --> 01:11:34.665
She gives a stroke,
she goes like...

01:11:35.105 --> 01:11:38.141
Maybe you can sing at the same time.

01:11:38.344 --> 01:11:40.539
What's that to me?

01:11:40.744 --> 01:11:43.257
Am I annoying?
- No.

01:11:43.463 --> 01:11:46.818
I am annoying. Sorry.
Sir, madam.

01:11:47.182 --> 01:11:48.456
Excuse me.

01:11:48.662 --> 01:11:49.890
Madam is coming.

01:11:50.102 --> 01:11:52.569
Madam is coming,
but keeps it to herself.

01:11:52.781 --> 01:11:55.897
How far are you with Sylvie?
- Like with the others.

01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:58.534
After a few hours
of extreme effort...

01:11:59.379 --> 01:12:02.894
Sylvie doesn't interest me.
- You know what your problem is?

01:12:03.099 --> 01:12:06.215
You act like it's a big achievement.
-What?

01:12:06.418 --> 01:12:08.487
To you it's a achievement.
-What?

01:12:08.697 --> 01:12:12.530
Sex. You do it, but you´re not
participating.

01:12:13.456 --> 01:12:16.891
What do you tell me now?
-It's true.

01:12:17.095 --> 01:12:20.804
The details of your private life
is none of my interests.

01:12:21.014 --> 01:12:24.450
Excuse us, your honor.
-He started.

01:12:24.654 --> 01:12:28.532
Later at the party you can continue
your discussion in the toilets.

01:12:28.733 --> 01:12:31.121
Unbelievable.

01:12:31.332 --> 01:12:35.370
What did you do more that I
couldn't do?

01:12:35.571 --> 01:12:37.687
You are too old for that stuff.

01:12:37.891 --> 01:12:41.280
I'm 2 years older than you are.
-A little bit more.

01:12:42.010 --> 01:12:44.523
Mister starts cavilling.

01:12:44.729 --> 01:12:47.401
You think too much about
the pleasure of the other.

01:12:47.608 --> 01:12:49.803
You have to let yourself go lose.
-You are an altruist.

01:12:50.008 --> 01:12:54.205
Get relaxed and think about yourself.
-That's selfish.

01:12:54.407 --> 01:12:58.115
It's better like this.
Otherwise you get blocked.

01:12:58.326 --> 01:13:00.964
You think too much about the
pleasure of others.

01:13:01.165 --> 01:13:04.634
You get blocked because you
are not focusing on yourself.

01:13:04.844 --> 01:13:08.553
In the end the pleasure of the woman,

01:13:08.763 --> 01:13:10.958
is the pleasure of a man.

01:13:11.163 --> 01:13:14.996
If I feel that the man isn't
enjoying ...

01:13:15.202 --> 01:13:18.511
his own pleasure...
-Wait a moment.

01:13:18.721 --> 01:13:22.474
If I feel that the man doesn't go
up in his own pleasure...

01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:24.318
You are not enjoying it because
I don't enjoy it?

01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:28.910
No, I get blocked.
-What a bad thing to hear afterwards.

01:13:29.119 --> 01:13:32.872
After all these years...
-I couldn't do it. No.

01:13:33.078 --> 01:13:35.466
All this effort I took to
temper myself...

01:13:35.677 --> 01:13:38.271
for hours.
I have been sweating from it.

01:13:38.477 --> 01:13:42.105
Let me explain.
-And it was wrong? It had to be fast.

01:13:42.316 --> 01:13:45.227
And you came two hours later,
while I was in the shower or asleep.

01:13:45.435 --> 01:13:47.585
This is really fucked.

01:13:47.795 --> 01:13:50.786
No, it's not like that.
-You push me too...

01:13:50.994 --> 01:13:54.542
I wanted...
-He fucks and she comes hours later.

01:13:54.753 --> 01:13:57.471
You can't explain.
-It's not rational.

01:13:57.672 --> 01:14:00.709
Your problem is that you
want an explanation for everything.

01:14:00.912 --> 01:14:02.708
But sometimes there is no explanation.

01:14:02.911 --> 01:14:07.540
It's like that talking for centuries.
Sometimes you just have to fuck.

01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:10.583
And afterwards everything is solved.
I don't know why.

01:14:10.789 --> 01:14:12.620
The bodies talk.
-Don't I have to talk?

01:14:12.829 --> 01:14:15.900
I talked during fucking.
Remember?

01:14:16.108 --> 01:14:19.895
But the bodies.
-And everything I said got you excited.

01:14:20.107 --> 01:14:22.177
It was just a chat.

01:14:22.387 --> 01:14:24.422
But it interested you.

01:14:24.626 --> 01:14:27.537
It was never a real extacy,
but once or twice ...

01:14:27.745 --> 01:14:30.623
Say it. He isn't listening anyway.
-More often.

01:14:30.825 --> 01:14:33.941
Really? More often, mate! More often!

01:14:34.144 --> 01:14:35.623
Mate!...more often.

01:14:35.823 --> 01:14:38.178
You always talk like an intellectual.
-Me?

01:14:38.383 --> 01:14:42.170
But after all it's always terra terra.
It's about sex.

01:14:42.382 --> 01:14:44.611
That's good, isn't it?
-But you say he's an animal.

01:14:44.821 --> 01:14:46.459
It's an essential need.

01:14:46.661 --> 01:14:48.253
He doesn't possess the language.

01:14:48.461 --> 01:14:51.338
"I fuck, I eat, I Marcus"

01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:53.132
But I diverse.

01:14:53.339 --> 01:14:55.614
I many trouble,
because I not speak the language very well.

01:14:55.819 --> 01:14:57.888
The language.
-Come on now, "Language".

01:14:58.098 --> 01:15:00.771
Are we there?
-I stay so I can wank myself off.

01:15:00.978 --> 01:15:02.456
Well ok.

01:15:04.737 --> 01:15:06.215
What a bullshit.

01:15:06.416 --> 01:15:09.533
More often.
That's not bad at all.

01:15:50.006 --> 01:15:51.962
Hello, Alexandra.

01:15:54.485 --> 01:15:56.203
Pierre here. I've got car trouble.

01:15:56.405 --> 01:15:58.474
I´ll come and get you with the metro.

01:15:59.084 --> 01:16:01.882
In 20 to 30 minutes.

01:16:27.878 --> 01:16:29.708
I had a dream.

01:16:42.354 --> 01:16:44.185
It was weird.

01:16:59.950 --> 01:17:02.783
I don't have any feeling in my arm.

01:17:10.828 --> 01:17:13.182
I walked through a tunnel.

01:17:15.587 --> 01:17:17.383
A tunnel...

01:17:18.586 --> 01:17:20.338
completely red...

01:17:22.145 --> 01:17:23.737
And afterwards...

01:17:24.505 --> 01:17:28.053
The tunnel broke in 2 pieces.

01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:46.217
I think...

01:17:48.579 --> 01:17:50.774
it's because of my menstruation.

01:17:55.418 --> 01:17:58.534
Are you over time.
Remember?

01:18:05.575 --> 01:18:07.611
A lot?

01:18:12.294 --> 01:18:14.887
No, just a few days.

01:18:15.493 --> 01:18:17.370
We'll see.

01:18:50.805 --> 01:18:52.999
We had a long sleep.

01:18:54.044 --> 01:18:56.876
We have to get up.
I have to buy a new bottle.

01:18:57.083 --> 01:18:59.961
for the party tonight.
Pierre...

01:19:00.203 --> 01:19:02.716
I have to be kind to him.

01:19:02.922 --> 01:19:06.118
because in the end I stole
his wife.

01:19:07.921 --> 01:19:09.240
What?

01:19:09.441 --> 01:19:12.318
And I have to be too...
-No...

01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:15.352
You didn't steal anything from anyone,
honey.

01:19:16.359 --> 01:19:19.668
I'm ...
I'm not a thing.

01:19:19.878 --> 01:19:22.346
You have not stolen anything
from anyone.

01:19:22.558 --> 01:19:25.071
I have done it.
I have decided everything.

01:19:25.277 --> 01:19:27.551
It's always the wife that decides.

01:19:31.276 --> 01:19:32.754
Really.

01:19:38.434 --> 01:19:40.072
But then again...

01:19:40.273 --> 01:19:43.390
It's true that you decide.
By the way...

01:19:44.433 --> 01:19:47.822
What do you get for me? Do you give
me parties with your ex?

01:19:48.032 --> 01:19:50.591
He may be a friend.

01:19:50.791 --> 01:19:52.509
But he is crazy about you.
He likes you.

01:19:52.711 --> 01:19:56.066
Whatever, you will pay.
-I won't pay shit.

01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:58.464
You decide and you pay for it.
-No, stop it.

01:19:58.669 --> 01:20:01.547
No, wait. I'm not awake yet.

01:20:02.868 --> 01:20:04.824
You'll pay for this.

01:20:05.028 --> 01:20:07.541
If you hurt me, you'll pay.

01:20:07.747 --> 01:20:09.624
You will pay.

01:20:09.827 --> 01:20:13.023
The revenge of the elephant.
-Stop it!

01:20:13.226 --> 01:20:15.659
Who kills children!

01:20:26.783 --> 01:20:28.579
Stop it.

01:20:29.182 --> 01:20:31.935
You know I don't like that.

01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:41.413
Then I will revenge myself too.

01:20:42.979 --> 01:20:44.651
With a kiss.

01:20:49.817 --> 01:20:52.570
You crushed me.
-That's not true.

01:20:52.817 --> 01:20:54.886
Wait, you...
-No.

01:20:55.096 --> 01:20:57.371
Did I hurt you?
You're exaggerating.

01:20:57.576 --> 01:21:01.090
You crushed my balls.
Dammit, Alex.

01:21:01.295 --> 01:21:04.525
That can't be.
Did I hurt you?

01:21:05.174 --> 01:21:06.812
You're a pig.

01:21:07.014 --> 01:21:09.049
You're a dirty pig.

01:21:09.253 --> 01:21:13.006
Then I will go away. I'll make
sone coffee. That will teach you.

01:21:14.372 --> 01:21:16.043
Stop it.

01:21:16.251 --> 01:21:18.811
Quit it.

01:21:20.330 --> 01:21:22.969
I'll make some coffee.
-Make some coffee?

01:21:23.490 --> 01:21:27.368
You know...
You should buy some booze.

01:21:31.128 --> 01:21:32.527
Go on.

01:21:33.088 --> 01:21:35.043
Okay.

01:21:40.126 --> 01:21:42.923
Take a look,
I have something here that hurts.

01:21:44.405 --> 01:21:46.759
No, really, I have something here.

01:21:50.284 --> 01:21:52.080
Will you play some music?

01:22:14.198 --> 01:22:15.870
No.

01:22:18.877 --> 01:22:20.356
Alex...
- What?

01:22:20.557 --> 01:22:23.992
I think I...
feel like fucking you in the ass.

01:22:24.196 --> 01:22:27.710
No! I thought you were
going to say something romantic.

01:22:27.915 --> 01:22:31.429
It is romantic.
- Oh? No, you know...

01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:34.848
I love you.

01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:36.936
I love you too.

01:23:58.854 --> 01:24:01.049
And what if I were pregnant?

01:24:08.132 --> 01:24:10.122
That wouldn't be so bad.

01:24:15.090 --> 01:24:16.808
Yes, please.

01:24:19.529 --> 01:24:20.962
Take a shower.

01:24:35.126 --> 01:24:36.319
Hey, well...

01:24:39.805 --> 01:24:41.203
I'm going to buy a bottle.

01:24:42.644 --> 01:24:44.600
You have money?

01:24:44.843 --> 01:24:46.913
Come on, stop it.
- What?

01:24:47.243 --> 01:24:49.392
Do you ever have money?

01:24:49.602 --> 01:24:52.560
Alright. Do you have some?

01:24:53.841 --> 01:24:55.718
I'll get some from your purse.

01:25:52.308 --> 01:25:53.980
See you later.

01:26:45.456 --> 01:26:48.174
PREGNANCY TEST

01:33:28.803 --> 01:33:33.830
TIME RUINS EVERYTHING
