16:47.423 --> 16:50.415
Sorry my locator spell

Was that a clever play on words?
Wonderful wit and sparkling theatrics.

some heavy artillery under that tie...

-All in a day's work, I guess.
-Wait.

17:42.686 --> 17:44.301
With powers like yours...

17:44.480 --> 17:47.517

Jealous women worry.

The company that published
Warrior Angel...

27:09.336 --> 27:11.827
...stole the idea
from a friend of Zatanna's father.

In order to exact
some Old World retribution...
