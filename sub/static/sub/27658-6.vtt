Do you know what's been going on?

HE SIGHS

01:37.048 --> 01:39.067
Usually, when you solve a case,

01:39.068 --> 01:42.044
you get a genuine sense of
closure, you know?

01:44.016 --> 01:46.176
And you're not feeling that
with the Tiana Palmer case?

She's what? Where is she?

02:10.003 --> 02:12.079
I should've stayed outside.

02:12.080 --> 02:14.015
Waited for you.

No, no, no, no, that's OK, Sarge.

02:15.072 --> 02:18.047
Just tell me where you are,
and we'll be straight there.

02:18.048 --> 02:19.064
I don't know.

02:20.072 --> 02:22.083
Followed Patrice. North.

02:22.084 --> 02:24.088
Can you describe where you
are at all?

02:37.092 --> 02:39.091
Did she say where she is?

02:39.092 --> 02:42.031
Yeah, she said that she followed
Patrice somewhere north.

02:42.032 --> 02:44.035
She said it was empty.

02:44.036 --> 02:45.196
There's a map in the Jeep.OK.

02:46.096 --> 02:50.015
JACK: Florence's voicemail said she
overheard Patrice on the phone

02:50.016 --> 02:52.055
arranging to meet someone,
so she followed him.

02:52.056 --> 02:54.075
JP: Well, this is the only place
north of Belle Mer.

02:54.076 --> 02:56.024
It's an old boat yard.

RUBY: Look, there's Patrice's car.

03:05.092 --> 03:09.096
You two take the back. But be
careful, whoever did this
might still be in there.

03:16.080 --> 03:18.036
She said an empty room.

03:19.052 --> 03:20.068
Florence!

03:24.060 --> 03:26.079
Oh, no! Florence?

03:26.080 --> 03:29.015
Can you hear me?

03:29.016 --> 03:31.003
JP!
JP: Sir?

03:31.004 --> 03:33.051
Tell me if you can hear what
I'm saying, Florence.

03:33.052 --> 03:36.083
WHISPERS: Sir...
You're going to be all right.

03:36.084 --> 03:37.999
OK.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.071
DISTANT SIRENS Oh!

03:40.072 --> 03:43.083
Just stay awake now, Florence.
You're going to be fine.

03:43.084 --> 03:45.011
JP!

03:45.012 --> 03:47.007
Did you see who did this to
you, Florence?

03:47.008 --> 03:49.063
No.OK, don't worry, just stay
with me.

03:49.064 --> 03:52.011
Stay still. I've got you,
Florence.

03:52.012 --> 03:53.087
You're going to be OK.

03:53.088 --> 03:55.084
Just through here.
This way, JP!

04:00.008 --> 04:03.035
It looks like a single bullet wound
to the stomach. She's conscious.

04:03.036 --> 04:05.012
How is she, sir?

04:06.008 --> 04:08.084
I don't know, JP. She's alive.

04:16.016 --> 04:18.031
Sir, I think you need to see
something.

04:18.031 --> 04:21.060
It'll have to wait, JP.
Sir, it can't wait!

04:25.016 --> 04:26.096
Oh, God, no, Patrice!

05:04.016 --> 05:07.072
There's bruising to his left temple,
so whoever did this hit him.

05:09.088 --> 05:13.019
Do you think this is connected
to the Tiana Palmer case?

05:13.020 --> 05:14.087
I do, sir, yes.

05:14.088 --> 05:18.019
Harrison Green was arrested
just over an hour ago.

05:18.020 --> 05:20.051
Even though he admitted he did it,

05:20.052 --> 05:22.075
Patrice here was convinced
Harrison was innocent.

05:22.076 --> 05:25.035
Harrison is not a killer.
I've known him all my life.

05:25.036 --> 05:27.095
Florence overheard Patrice on the
phone to someone...

05:27.096 --> 05:29.019
talking about Harrison.

05:29.020 --> 05:30.999
Then we need to talk.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.027
And he arranged to meet whoever
it was here.

05:33.028 --> 05:35.039
Yeah, I know it. 20 minutes.

05:35.040 --> 05:37.071
DS Cassell followed him, and...

05:37.072 --> 05:39.016
The rest you know.

05:40.060 --> 05:41.064
HE SIGHS

05:42.072 --> 05:43.076
Sir...

05:44.076 --> 05:47.027
I checked the last dialled number
on Patrice's phone,

05:47.028 --> 05:50.007
made an hour ago. The call Florence
heard.Mm.

05:50.008 --> 05:53.039
It's a landline for the villa
on Rosalie Island.

05:53.040 --> 05:55.055
Ewan Boyd's place?

05:55.056 --> 05:57.019
Who's Ewan Boyd?

05:57.020 --> 06:02.055
Ewan Boyd owns a lucrative financial
investment company.

06:02.056 --> 06:05.075
A millionaire many times over.

06:05.076 --> 06:07.083
And he lives on this Rosalie
Island?

06:07.084 --> 06:10.079
He divides his time
between New York, London

06:10.080 --> 06:14.067
and, erm, his Caribbean bolthole,
as I believe he calls it.

06:14.068 --> 06:16.055
Is he there at the moment?

06:16.056 --> 06:18.052
I heard mention he's back.

06:19.068 --> 06:23.044
Anyone else live there? He usually
arrives with some sort of entourage.

06:28.028 --> 06:30.028
There's something in that bag.

06:43.008 --> 06:44.035
Strange.

06:44.036 --> 06:45.055
A cushion?

06:45.056 --> 06:48.020
Yeah. Pretty good fabric, too.

06:49.032 --> 06:52.003
Why would someone put a
lovely-looking cushion in a bag,

06:52.004 --> 06:54.035
then throw into the sea?

06:54.036 --> 06:57.008
Because perhaps
they didn't want it any more?

07:02.052 --> 07:04.043
JP: Captain says we'll be
at Rosalie Island

07:04.044 --> 07:05.084
in ten minutes, Inspector.

07:20.048 --> 07:21.079
Which way to the house?

07:21.080 --> 07:22.088
I'll show you.

07:35.040 --> 07:38.031
It seems we have company.

07:38.032 --> 07:39.072
I'll deal with it.

07:45.052 --> 07:47.023
Afternoon.

07:47.024 --> 07:48.067
I'm Frances Compton.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.003
How can I be of help?

07:50.004 --> 07:52.043
Detective Inspector Jack Mooney.

07:52.044 --> 07:55.059
We'd like to speak to everyone
currently residing at that house

07:55.060 --> 07:59.067
about an incident that occurred on
Saint Marie this afternoon.

07:59.068 --> 08:01.048
Please, come this way.

08:03.068 --> 08:05.007
Ewan Boyd.

08:05.008 --> 08:07.023
Welcome to Rosalie Island,
Inspector.

08:07.024 --> 08:09.091
Well, I appreciate you finding
the time to talk to us, Mr Boyd.

08:09.092 --> 08:11.020
No, Ewan, please.

08:12.032 --> 08:14.095
What's this all about, then?
It's the police, Martin.

08:14.096 --> 08:17.075
They're here to talk to us about
a murder on Saint Marie.

08:17.076 --> 08:20.031
Christ. This is going to
be fun, then.

08:20.032 --> 08:22.087
This is Martin Stow, Inspector.

08:22.088 --> 08:24.059
He heads up my legal team.

08:24.060 --> 08:27.019
Yes, excuse the clobber,

08:27.020 --> 08:29.035
but you catch me
on one of the rare occasions

08:29.036 --> 08:31.060
when I managed to make it
into the gym.

08:32.068 --> 08:37.095
Three days ago, a young woman by the
name of Tiana Palmer was murdered,

08:37.096 --> 08:40.087
we believe by her boyfriend,
Harrison Green.

08:40.087 --> 08:43.023
Either of those two names
mean anything to you?

08:43.024 --> 08:46.011
We... know Harrison.

08:46.012 --> 08:49.023
We use his water-taxi to get to and
from the mainland.

08:49.024 --> 08:50.051
And you all used it?

08:50.052 --> 08:53.087
Well, Frances and Ewan
probably more than me, but...

08:53.088 --> 08:57.019
Are you sure it was him? He seemed
like a very pleasant kid.

08:57.020 --> 08:59.027
Well, he's just confessed to it.

08:59.028 --> 09:02.035
But since then, there's been another
murder. Bloody hell!

09:02.036 --> 09:06.008
And just to be clear, none of you
have come across Tiana Palmer?

09:10.000 --> 09:11.028
No.

09:12.088 --> 09:14.024
No, I don't know her.

09:15.068 --> 09:18.023
Never met the girl.
Pretty, though.

09:18.024 --> 09:22.067
I'm sorry, what does any of this
have to do with us?

09:22.068 --> 09:24.079
After Harrison was arrested,
his best friend,

09:24.080 --> 09:26.027
a man called Patrice Campbell,

09:26.028 --> 09:27.091
phoned this villa here.

09:27.092 --> 09:31.007
Patrice spoke to whoever it
was who answered the phone

09:31.008 --> 09:33.083
and arranged to meet them on Saint
Marie to talk about Harrison.

09:33.084 --> 09:36.019
My DS followed Patrice to that
meeting,

09:36.020 --> 09:37.100
and both of them were shot.

09:38.080 --> 09:40.076
And the call to this villa
was made at...

09:41.084 --> 09:43.071
..1.30 this afternoon.

09:43.072 --> 09:45.003
And lasted for...

09:45.004 --> 09:46.059
Oh.

09:46.060 --> 09:48.028
Two minutes, three seconds.

09:50.004 --> 09:53.035
So it follows that one of you
answered the phone.

09:53.036 --> 09:55.083
One of you spoke to Patrice
Campbell.

09:55.084 --> 09:57.047
Well, I know I didn't.

09:57.048 --> 10:00.019
I did hear the phone ring,
but I was busy working...

10:00.020 --> 10:02.043
PHONE RINGS
..so I... I didn't pick it up.

10:02.044 --> 10:05.019
I assumed someone else answered.

10:05.020 --> 10:06.044
PHONE RINGS

10:09.036 --> 10:11.015
I was taking a... siesta after
lunch...

10:11.016 --> 10:14.091
PHONE RINGS
..so all too happy to
let it ring out.

10:14.092 --> 10:18.015
So you're saying there was no-one
else here, on the island,

10:18.016 --> 10:22.004
yet none of you answered the call
made by Patrice Campbell?

10:23.052 --> 10:27.011
And tell me, does anyone here own a
gun?

10:27.012 --> 10:28.047
Sorry, who do you think we are?

10:28.048 --> 10:31.027
It's OK, Martin. The Inspector's
just doing his job.

10:31.028 --> 10:34.055
No. No, Inspector, none of us
owns a gun.

10:34.056 --> 10:39.059
Right, and did anyone here leave the
island in the last two hours?

10:39.060 --> 10:41.011
Uh-uh.

10:41.012 --> 10:42.055
Out of curiosity,

10:42.056 --> 10:45.059
if you did need to get over to the
mainland, do you have the means?

10:45.060 --> 10:50.011
Well, we have a small tender, but
it's being serviced on Saint Marie.

10:50.012 --> 10:52.059
Although, the previous owners
left a little skiff behind,

10:52.060 --> 10:53.095
but that had a hole in it, right?

10:53.096 --> 10:56.031
Chucked it out, few years back.

10:56.032 --> 10:58.063
So there you go, Inspector.

10:58.064 --> 11:01.055
We don't have a gun and we don't
have a ruddy boat,

11:01.056 --> 11:03.063
so it can't be one of us that
did it.

11:03.064 --> 11:06.028
I hope that clears things up
for you.

11:07.096 --> 11:11.007
I want you to search this
place, high up and low down.

11:11.008 --> 11:13.031
See if you can find a gun,
or any evidence of one.

11:13.032 --> 11:14.059
BOTH: Yes, sir.

11:14.060 --> 11:17.096
Let's see if they were telling the
truth about not having a boat.

11:47.032 --> 11:48.043
Sir?

11:48.044 --> 11:50.023
Any news?

11:50.024 --> 11:51.087
Well, we searched the house.

11:51.088 --> 11:54.047
There's no sign of a gun or
any bullets,

11:54.048 --> 11:56.003
or even paperwork for a weapon.

11:56.004 --> 11:58.031
And what about you, sir?
Did you find their boat?

11:58.032 --> 11:59.052
No, Ruby, I didn't.

12:00.064 --> 12:03.019
Went around the whole
perimeter of this island,

12:03.020 --> 12:04.083
no watercraft to be seen anywhere.

12:04.084 --> 12:06.004
RUBY: Oh!

12:09.012 --> 12:12.016
Mind you, I think this is where they
used to keep their skiff.

12:13.040 --> 12:16.048
Couple of oars there
and some fuel canisters.

12:19.048 --> 12:21.063
But no actual boat.

12:21.064 --> 12:25.051
So maybe it wasn't one of
them that did it.

12:25.052 --> 12:28.020
But who did Patrice speak to at the
villa if it wasn't one of them?

12:29.096 --> 12:31.032
Hang on!

12:35.072 --> 12:37.007
Cushions.

12:37.008 --> 12:38.027
Cushions?

12:38.028 --> 12:40.007
Cushions.

12:40.008 --> 12:41.096
Like peas in a pod.

12:43.024 --> 12:44.071
The one from Rosalie Island

12:44.072 --> 12:47.047
is an exact match for the one I
found floating not a hair's breadth

12:47.048 --> 12:49.032
from where Patrice was murdered.

12:51.048 --> 12:55.027
All three of them deny coming over
to meet Patrice.

12:55.028 --> 12:58.047
But if one of their cushions
made it over to Saint Marie,

12:58.048 --> 13:01.071
then that means
someone must've brought it.

13:01.072 --> 13:03.080
I mean, it didn't travel here by
itself, did it?

13:05.084 --> 13:09.075
But why would a killer bring a
cushion to commit murder?

13:09.076 --> 13:12.055
And how? They didn't have a boat.

13:12.056 --> 13:14.091
I mean, it was 20 minutes
between Patrice making a call

13:14.092 --> 13:16.003
and him being shot,

13:16.004 --> 13:19.023
so they couldn't have swum it
in that time.

13:19.024 --> 13:23.019
So how did our murderer get
to Saint Marie and back again?

13:23.020 --> 13:25.080
PHONE RINGS

13:28.092 --> 13:31.060
Commissioner. How's Florence?

13:35.096 --> 13:37.079
Well, that is fantastic news, sir.

13:37.080 --> 13:40.008
Thank you, sir.
Thanks for letting us know.

13:41.096 --> 13:45.071
She's out of surgery. They managed
to remove the bullet successfully

13:45.072 --> 13:47.152
and see no reason why she can't make
a full recovery.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.095
Well, it's late.

13:53.096 --> 13:55.071
We should try and get some sleep.

13:55.072 --> 13:57.083
In the morning, I will pay a visit
to Harrison Green

13:57.084 --> 14:00.028
and see what he has to say
about what happened to Patrice.

14:02.032 --> 14:04.063
Thank you. Both of you.

14:04.064 --> 14:06.095
That was a tough hand we
were dealt today,

14:06.096 --> 14:11.051
but you stayed focused, kept going
and you acted with integrity.

14:11.052 --> 14:14.083
You can be very proud of
yourselves. Thank you, sir.

14:14.084 --> 14:15.092
Thank you.

14:34.060 --> 14:37.023
You really put the wind up us
for a while there,

14:37.024 --> 14:39.000
Detective Sergeant Cassell.

14:42.080 --> 14:44.024
Don't ever do that to me again.

14:50.092 --> 14:52.059
SHE GROANS

14:52.060 --> 14:54.020
There she is.

14:55.068 --> 14:56.084
You OK?

14:57.088 --> 14:58.092
You're in hospital.

15:00.024 --> 15:01.144
You took a bullet, remember?

15:02.084 --> 15:05.024
But the doctors say
you've nothing to worry about.

15:07.084 --> 15:09.024
Patrice...

15:10.092 --> 15:13.052
..is he OK?

15:19.008 --> 15:21.023
Florence, I'm so sorry.

15:21.024 --> 15:24.007
There's no easy way to say
this...

15:24.008 --> 15:26.012
FLORENCE SOBS No!

15:27.080 --> 15:31.024
Oh, my goodness, no!

15:43.016 --> 15:46.075
We all know there was a gun
kept here in this office,

15:46.076 --> 15:48.043
but now it's gone,

15:48.044 --> 15:51.052
and a man has been shot
dead, so who the hell took it?

15:59.056 --> 16:02.047
HARRISON: No!
OFFICER: Steady!

16:02.048 --> 16:07.035
No. You all right, sir?
No way, not Patrice.

16:07.036 --> 16:09.031
Sorry, Harrison.

16:09.032 --> 16:12.075
I don't understand.
Who did this? Why?!

16:12.076 --> 16:15.043
This is what I'm trying
to tell you. Whoever it is did it

16:15.044 --> 16:17.999
because Patrice wanted to speak to
them about you,

16:18.000 --> 16:20.087
about you not killing Tiana.

16:20.088 --> 16:21.096
But I did.

16:23.052 --> 16:25.075
I told you. It was me.

16:25.076 --> 16:27.084
No-one else. I stabbed her!

16:34.080 --> 16:37.067
And there was no-one else
involved? No!

16:37.068 --> 16:39.079
And what about the people
on Rosalie Island?

16:39.080 --> 16:41.003
Is there something you're not

16:41.004 --> 16:44.024
telling me about your relationship
with them? No.

16:46.004 --> 16:48.031
They've been good to me.

16:48.032 --> 16:51.079
Given me a lot of work over
the years, and friendly with it.

16:51.080 --> 16:53.083
Friendly?
In what way friendly?

16:53.084 --> 16:56.011
Just chatting with me on my
boat.

16:56.012 --> 16:57.032
No more.

17:00.080 --> 17:01.084
Inspector...

17:05.096 --> 17:07.063
What I did to Tiana...

17:07.064 --> 17:09.022
..I did it on my own.

17:09.023 --> 17:10.088
Because I had to.

17:12.028 --> 17:14.003
I was bursting with pain.

17:16.031 --> 17:18.031
And I did it to make it stop.

17:23.051 --> 17:26.042
COMMISSIONER: You met with Harrison
this morning. What did he say?

17:26.044 --> 17:30.027
Well, he insists that he acted
alone when he stabbed Tiana.

17:30.028 --> 17:34.059
And he says the only connection
he has to the residents of Rosalie
Island

17:34.060 --> 17:37.031
is their use of his water-taxi
the last few years.

17:37.032 --> 17:41.007
But, sir, if Patrice met
someone from Rosalie Island

17:41.008 --> 17:43.031
to talk to them about what Harrison
had done,

17:43.032 --> 17:45.067
and then the same person
ended up killing him,

17:45.068 --> 17:48.059
I mean, surely Patrice was
onto something, right?

17:48.060 --> 17:49.999
Correct.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.059
Somebody was trying to
silence Patrice.

17:52.060 --> 17:56.051
Which means there's more
to Tiana Palmer's murder

17:56.052 --> 17:58.067
than we first thought.

17:58.068 --> 18:01.064
And it all links back
to Rosalie Island.

18:03.080 --> 18:06.003
Our job is to find out
what that connection is.

18:06.004 --> 18:09.039
RUBY: So, Ewan Boyd. Originally from
Edinburgh, in Scotland.

18:09.040 --> 18:12.023
At the age of 27, he set up an
investment company.

18:12.024 --> 18:15.071
His current net worth is - get
this - 33 million.

18:15.072 --> 18:19.071
I mean... 33 million?! Ah!

18:19.072 --> 18:21.003
Frances Compton.

18:21.004 --> 18:24.007
Joined Ewan's company in
the early '90s

18:24.008 --> 18:26.023
as in-house psychiatrist
and motivator.

18:26.024 --> 18:29.035
Her official title now
is Company Vice President.

18:29.036 --> 18:32.083
In-house psychiatrist and
motivator.

18:32.084 --> 18:34.063
How does that work?

18:34.064 --> 18:37.027
It's not uncommon
in high-finance companies.

18:37.028 --> 18:39.047
It's all about keeping
employees' focused.

18:39.048 --> 18:43.027
You know, getting rid of negative
thoughts so they can perform at
their best.

18:43.028 --> 18:46.035
And earning their CEOs as much money
as is possible, I assume.

18:46.036 --> 18:47.999
And finally, Martin Stow.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.075
Boyd's legal executive. Works at a
corporate firm in New York City

18:51.076 --> 18:54.031
and was a partner by the age of 30,

18:54.032 --> 18:56.043
but left not long after to work
in-house for Boyd.

18:56.044 --> 18:59.019
Right. They all claim
they were on Rosalie Island

18:59.020 --> 19:01.095
at the time of the shooting,
so how did they do it?

19:01.096 --> 19:05.003
We searched that island high up and
low down, there was no boat there.

19:05.004 --> 19:06.091
And I checked the harbours
this morning,

19:06.092 --> 19:10.043
and no-one hired a boat for them or
went to pick anyone up.

19:10.044 --> 19:14.035
So where do you intend to start?

19:14.036 --> 19:15.044
Well...

19:16.076 --> 19:20.047
..so far, there is no hint in the
Tiana Palmer investigation

19:20.048 --> 19:22.040
of a link to Rosalie Island.

19:23.080 --> 19:26.087
But maybe we haven't come across one

19:26.088 --> 19:29.076
because we weren't looking for one.

19:34.060 --> 19:36.999
Tiana's phone and her laptop.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.075
We need to recover deleted
files and web history.

19:39.076 --> 19:42.055
You know, stuff Tiana didn't want
people to find.

19:42.056 --> 19:46.083
My cousin Roscoe is an absolute
genius when it comes to computers.

19:46.084 --> 19:48.095
Right, Commissioner Patterson?

19:48.096 --> 19:53.027
Roscoe is annoyingly proficient
when it comes to technology.

19:53.028 --> 19:55.060
OK, I'll be back.

19:56.068 --> 19:58.067
Right, give Roscoe a bell.

19:58.068 --> 19:59.071
Sure thing.

19:59.072 --> 20:02.075
JP, how are you getting on with the
suspects' phone records?

20:02.076 --> 20:04.024
Ah, yes.

20:05.080 --> 20:09.999
So we have lots of calls made to New
York and to London,

20:10.000 --> 20:11.059
and a fair few made to Harrison.

20:11.060 --> 20:14.035
I assume when they needed
transport to the mainland.

20:14.036 --> 20:16.051
Apart from that, there's only one
other phone call

20:16.052 --> 20:19.055
made to a Saint Marie
number in the last month. Who to?

20:19.056 --> 20:21.043
To a luxury gift shop in Port
Royal,

20:21.044 --> 20:23.071
and it came from Ewan
Boyd's phone number.

20:23.072 --> 20:26.015
Well, it's not much to go on,
but if we're looking for a link

20:26.016 --> 20:29.023
between Rosalie Island and Tiana
Palmer, we've got to start
somewhere.

20:29.024 --> 20:31.011
Yep.OK.

20:31.012 --> 20:32.032
OK...

20:34.024 --> 20:39.023
So this is what Ewan Boyd ordered
just over three weeks ago.

20:39.024 --> 20:42.079
And get this - he even asked for an
inscription to be made.

20:42.080 --> 20:44.023
"For Tiana from E".

20:44.024 --> 20:46.019
And a kiss?

20:46.020 --> 20:48.003
So Ewan did know her.

20:48.004 --> 20:49.031
It appears so, sir.

20:49.032 --> 20:51.095
And had feelings for her, too,
I think it's fair to surmise.

20:51.096 --> 20:54.051
The thing is, the shop delivered
it to Tiana a week ago,

20:54.052 --> 20:56.019
and she returned it back the
same day.

20:56.020 --> 20:57.067
She didn't even ask
for a refund,

20:57.068 --> 20:59.068
just said she couldn't accept
it.

21:07.068 --> 21:12.019
So let's start again,
how did you and Tiana meet?

21:12.020 --> 21:14.092
Well, she came to a party
here, on the beach...

21:16.028 --> 21:17.063
An open-house thing.

21:17.064 --> 21:20.003
A few locals from Belle Mer came
over. Tiana was one of them.

21:20.004 --> 21:22.007
And what? You just got chatting?

21:22.008 --> 21:25.023
Well, that's how it works for me,
Inspector, meeting women.

21:25.024 --> 21:27.007
Do you have a different approach?

21:27.008 --> 21:28.059
HE LAUGHS Er, no.

21:28.060 --> 21:31.039
Not sure I have an approach at all,
to be honest with you, Ewan.

21:31.040 --> 21:35.075
But then, I was never one for
chatting up girls half my age.

21:35.076 --> 21:37.032
HE LAUGHS DRYLY

21:38.028 --> 21:41.015
Did Tiana ever mention
she had a boyfriend?

21:41.016 --> 21:42.059
Briefly.

21:42.060 --> 21:45.023
That's why she was out drinking, she
said, letting off steam.

21:45.024 --> 21:47.043
Seemed like they were going
through a rough patch.

21:47.044 --> 21:50.015
And after the first night
that you met,

21:50.016 --> 21:51.091
how many times did you see
her after that?

21:51.092 --> 21:54.019
She came to a couple of other
parties.

21:54.020 --> 21:55.075
It was early days.

21:55.076 --> 21:58.084
And yet you were already sending her
expensive jewellery.

21:59.092 --> 22:04.019
I just wanted her to know
that I was interested, that's all.

22:04.020 --> 22:06.051
Except, she wasn't.

22:06.052 --> 22:08.063
Miss Palmer...

22:08.064 --> 22:10.083
..returned the jewellery.

22:10.084 --> 22:13.007
So I believe. And you were angry
about that?

22:13.008 --> 22:14.064
Disappointed, no more.

22:17.008 --> 22:19.056
Is there something the matter,
Inspector?

22:20.096 --> 22:24.003
It's all a bit convenient,
don't you think? What is?

22:24.004 --> 22:26.067
A young woman who rejects you

22:26.068 --> 22:28.035
is killed a few days later

22:28.036 --> 22:30.087
and her boyfriend arrested.

22:30.088 --> 22:32.071
Convinced her boyfriend
is innocent,

22:32.072 --> 22:35.007
a friend of his phones this
villa here

22:35.008 --> 22:37.091
to see if he can get at the
truth of the matter.

22:37.092 --> 22:40.008
And what happens?
He winds up dead himself.

22:41.036 --> 22:44.039
Now do you see the picture
I'm painting for you, Ewan?

22:44.040 --> 22:45.048
How it looks to us?

22:47.064 --> 22:48.068
PHONE RINGS

22:50.088 --> 22:52.087
It's Ruby, I'd better take it.

22:52.088 --> 22:54.036
Excuse me a moment.

22:56.080 --> 22:57.084
Ruby...

22:59.048 --> 23:01.015
I need a glass of water.

23:01.016 --> 23:02.028
That's fine, Mr Boyd.

23:03.028 --> 23:05.083
I wasn't asking your permission.

23:05.084 --> 23:10.039
And you say this was in Tiana's
deleted internet history? Yes, sir.

23:10.040 --> 23:14.003
I took her laptop to Roscoe, and
he's managed to recover everything

23:14.004 --> 23:15.091
she got rid of in the last month.

23:15.092 --> 23:17.019
Good man, Roscoe.

23:17.020 --> 23:20.095
Absolutely. And he's also forwarded
you a link to her e-mails,

23:20.096 --> 23:24.035
and it should be waiting for you in
JP's inbox.Great. Thanks, Ruby.

23:24.036 --> 23:26.036
Ah, thank you, sir. Bye!

23:32.044 --> 23:34.012
OK, I've got them, sir.

23:36.056 --> 23:38.083
"I understand your desire
to get to know Mr Boyd better.

23:38.084 --> 23:41.035
"But maybe some time apart
might be more advisable.

23:41.036 --> 23:43.035
"Some breathing space, perhaps."

23:43.036 --> 23:45.068
And they're all
from Frances Compton.

23:46.072 --> 23:48.047
So that's another one of
our suspects

23:48.048 --> 23:50.047
who lied about the fact
they did know Tiana.

23:50.048 --> 23:52.031
Mm-hm.

23:52.032 --> 23:54.079
Well, you need to understand,

23:54.080 --> 23:58.084
Tiana wasn't the first pretty young
thing Ewan showed an interest in.

24:00.044 --> 24:04.008
He likes to let his hair down
every now and then, as a release.

24:05.044 --> 24:07.019
Ewan's infatuations
never last long,

24:07.020 --> 24:11.023
and the kind of girls he attracts
can be a little hard to shake off.

24:11.024 --> 24:12.087
It's his money, you see,

24:12.088 --> 24:15.063
makes them rather... clingy.

24:15.064 --> 24:19.011
And so you, what? You make sure they
get the message it's over?

24:19.012 --> 24:23.031
I'm more adept than Ewan
at sugar-coating the pill.

24:23.032 --> 24:26.060
It's always been a skill of mine -
managing people's expectations...

24:27.064 --> 24:31.055
..helping them... come around
to my way of thinking.

24:31.056 --> 24:34.023
But from what I know of Tiana,

24:34.024 --> 24:36.095
I struggle to believe that she'd
be after Ewan

24:36.096 --> 24:39.071
because of his money.
Yeah, I sensed she was different.

24:39.072 --> 24:41.047
She wanted more from their
relationship,

24:41.048 --> 24:42.999
and I didn't want
her getting hurt.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.051
Which is why she returned the
jewellery Mr Boyd sent her.

24:45.052 --> 24:47.044
She must've got the hint from
the e-mails.

24:48.064 --> 24:50.003
I assume so.

24:50.004 --> 24:52.063
And what about you, Frances?

24:52.064 --> 24:54.083
What are your own feelings
for Mr Boyd?

24:54.084 --> 24:56.031
SHE CHUCKLES Sorry?

24:56.032 --> 24:59.067
Well, you've been working
with him for 30 years now.

24:59.068 --> 25:01.039
You work together.

25:01.040 --> 25:02.063
You live together.

25:02.064 --> 25:04.047
You even holiday together,

25:04.048 --> 25:06.028
judging by the photos
I saw up in his office.

25:09.096 --> 25:12.067
We're very close.
I'd be lying if I said otherwise.

25:12.068 --> 25:14.043
And what if someone
threatened that?

25:14.044 --> 25:16.055
Not because they were after
his money,

25:16.056 --> 25:18.043
but because they genuinely
cared about him.

25:18.044 --> 25:21.051
How would you feel about that?
I'd be delighted for him!

25:21.052 --> 25:23.079
But in the 30 years I've spent
with Ewan,

25:23.080 --> 25:26.031
I've never once seen him stay
in a relationship

25:26.032 --> 25:27.079
for more than a month or so.

25:27.080 --> 25:30.092
It's, erm... Well, it's just not
what he wants from life.

25:33.076 --> 25:36.024
Thank you for your time.
Pleasure.

25:43.080 --> 25:46.035
Is it me, or do you get the
impression

25:46.036 --> 25:48.999
it's really Frances who's pulling
all the strings round here,

25:49.000 --> 25:50.011
not Ewan?

25:50.012 --> 25:51.044
Hm.

25:53.028 --> 25:55.043
I wonder who MF is?

25:55.044 --> 25:58.012
One of Ewan Boyd's many
dalliances, I imagine.

26:09.016 --> 26:11.040
PHONE RINGS

26:13.076 --> 26:16.087
Ah, sir, you're back. I've got quite
a few things to update you on.

26:16.088 --> 26:18.027
That's great, Ruby, just one sec.

26:18.028 --> 26:20.063
Catherine! How are you?

26:20.064 --> 26:22.051
I've just been to visit Florence.

26:22.052 --> 26:25.095
Is she OK? The doctors are happy,
but...

26:25.096 --> 26:28.019
..in herself, not good.

26:28.020 --> 26:32.011
She just wants to be with you,
trying to find Patrice's killer.

26:32.012 --> 26:34.075
Maybe you could drop by this
evening.

26:34.076 --> 26:37.067
Let her know how you're
getting on with the case?

26:37.068 --> 26:39.024
OK, thanks, Catherine.

26:49.084 --> 26:51.023
Yeah, we got engaged.

26:51.024 --> 26:52.060
Wow!

27:01.064 --> 27:02.095
Hey, there.

27:02.096 --> 27:05.027
Brought some visitors for you.

27:05.028 --> 27:06.056
If you're up to it.

27:07.092 --> 27:09.051
It's good to see you, Sarge.

27:09.052 --> 27:11.000
It's really good to see you.

27:13.072 --> 27:16.079
Yeah, well, I've looked bloody
everywhere.

27:16.080 --> 27:20.063
Listen, if by some miracle
it turns up at your place,

27:20.064 --> 27:22.080
you let me know straight
away, yeah?

27:28.004 --> 27:31.007
If it's one of the three
suspects on Rosalie Island,

27:31.008 --> 27:34.031
there must be some way they
were able to travel across

27:34.032 --> 27:35.083
to Saint Marie and back.

27:35.084 --> 27:40.003
They've no boat. No-one we know of
chartered them one.

27:40.004 --> 27:44.003
And as for swimming it, well, that's
too far in the time they had.

27:44.004 --> 27:47.083
That said, why was one of their
cushions at the crime scene?

27:47.084 --> 27:50.011
You definitely didn't catch
a glimpse

27:50.012 --> 27:52.036
of whoever it was
pulled the trigger?

27:54.024 --> 27:55.039
I saw...

27:55.040 --> 27:59.011
..movement in the shadows,
and I heard a gunshot.

27:59.012 --> 28:01.071
GUNSHOT Agh!

28:01.072 --> 28:03.051
No.

28:03.052 --> 28:04.064
That was it.

28:07.016 --> 28:10.003
Ruby, you said you had
something from the lab?

28:10.004 --> 28:13.083
Um, yes, they managed to connect...

28:13.084 --> 28:16.095
the gun to a previous crime.

28:16.096 --> 28:19.071
It was an armed robbery
about a year ago.

28:19.072 --> 28:23.059
JP, are you aware of anyone who
might fence a dodgy weapon?

28:23.060 --> 28:25.027
Um...

28:25.028 --> 28:28.055
Well, the only guy I know that deals
with illegal weapons

28:28.056 --> 28:31.044
is a man called Darrius
Brookes. Oof!

28:32.044 --> 28:33.055
You know him?

28:33.056 --> 28:36.083
Well, not personally, but I've heard
Uncle Selwyn mention him.

28:36.084 --> 28:39.067
Not a fan of Darrius
is Uncle Selly.

28:39.068 --> 28:41.012
They have history.

28:43.016 --> 28:45.020
Well, that's where we go next.

28:46.096 --> 28:48.004
But in the morning.

28:50.068 --> 28:52.008
Oh.Yeah.

28:53.072 --> 28:55.071
Hang in there, Sarge.

28:55.072 --> 28:59.008
Yeah, hang in there, Sarge.

29:13.076 --> 29:15.003
HE SIGHS

29:15.004 --> 29:17.000
Sorry, I... should've...

29:19.012 --> 29:21.076
We're supposed to be getting
married tomorrow.

29:25.016 --> 29:28.012
I don't think
I know how to deal with this...

29:37.012 --> 29:39.095
Well, the thing that
helped me was...

29:39.096 --> 29:41.096
..to think if Kathleen had the
choice...

29:43.012 --> 29:44.732
..what would she want me
to do with my life?

29:47.000 --> 29:48.600
And the answer always came
back the same.

29:50.040 --> 29:52.036
She'd want me to try and be
happy again.

29:53.044 --> 29:54.075
Somehow.

29:54.076 --> 29:55.096
Someday.

29:59.068 --> 30:02.063
If you're feeling
like there's no point to it all...

30:02.064 --> 30:06.000
..just look at the ring on your
finger, who it represents...

30:07.036 --> 30:08.596
..and think, what would he
want for you?

30:17.032 --> 30:18.068
Try and get some sleep.

30:31.064 --> 30:33.072
A friendly sort, then, is our
Darrius?

30:34.092 --> 30:36.072
DOG BARKS

30:38.068 --> 30:39.072
Mr Brookes.

30:41.012 --> 30:43.036
Detective Inspector Jack Mooney.

30:45.040 --> 30:49.044
OK, well, that didn't play out
quite as I'd hoped.

30:56.008 --> 30:57.024
Darrius!

30:59.028 --> 31:01.084
Come back here now.

31:08.064 --> 31:11.080
We need to have a little chat.

31:21.096 --> 31:23.063
So, how long
have they been in there now?

31:23.064 --> 31:26.060
Three minutes since the last time
you asked me, Ruby.

31:27.092 --> 31:29.035
Which is what?

31:29.036 --> 31:30.071
30 minutes.

31:30.072 --> 31:32.043
They have been in there half
an hour.

31:32.044 --> 31:33.091
OK?

31:33.092 --> 31:35.028
Thank you, JP.

31:38.076 --> 31:40.035
So how did it go, sir?

31:40.036 --> 31:42.015
Well, the Commissioner
played a blinder.

31:42.016 --> 31:44.027
Darrius sang like the
proverbial canary.

31:44.028 --> 31:45.095
Him and I have, erm, history.

31:45.096 --> 31:47.011
Told you.

31:47.012 --> 31:50.055
What did he say? A week ago, he was
approached by one of the residents

31:50.056 --> 31:53.003
from Rosalie Island and sold
them a gun.

31:53.004 --> 31:56.020
So who did Darrius sell the
gun to?

31:57.032 --> 31:59.003
I don't know who this Darrius
fellow is,

31:59.004 --> 32:03.079
and... I don't know why, but he's
making the whole thing up.

32:03.080 --> 32:06.067
He is? Right.

32:06.068 --> 32:09.051
So you're saying that you and
he have never met or even spoken?

32:09.052 --> 32:10.087
Never.

32:10.088 --> 32:12.060
This is Mr Brookes' mobile phone.

32:14.008 --> 32:15.368
There was a call received on it...

32:17.000 --> 32:20.023
..yesterday at 6.29.

32:20.024 --> 32:24.003
Now, I'm going to phone the incoming
number right now.

32:24.004 --> 32:25.064
Let's see what happens.

32:27.064 --> 32:30.008
PHONE RINGS

32:34.048 --> 32:38.015
Right, I'm not saying another word.
Fine. JP, Ruby, arrest him.

32:38.016 --> 32:39.095
Yep.
No, you're not doing this.

32:39.096 --> 32:42.055
Martin Stow, I am arresting
you on suspicion of murder.

32:42.056 --> 32:44.035
I haven't murdered anyone,
for God's sake!

32:44.036 --> 32:46.091
You don't have to say anything...
Ewan! Ewan! Get in here now!

32:46.092 --> 32:48.999
..but anything you do say
may be given in evidence

32:49.000 --> 32:51.011
against you in a court of law.
What is happening?

32:51.012 --> 32:54.092
They know about the gun, Ewan.
They know about the bloody gun.

32:56.012 --> 32:59.000
Would someone care to tell
me what the hell is going on?

33:03.028 --> 33:05.004
In private, please.

33:07.096 --> 33:10.024
The... the truth of the matter
is...

33:12.000 --> 33:14.004
..I'm ill, Inspector.

33:15.024 --> 33:17.999
A brain tumour. I was receiving
treatment back in New York,

33:18.000 --> 33:19.400
but it wasn't really working, so...

33:22.056 --> 33:24.047
Well, if you're forced
to face your final days,

33:24.048 --> 33:26.052
you might as well do it
somewhere sunny, eh?

33:28.056 --> 33:30.003
I'm sorry, Ewan.

33:30.004 --> 33:32.007
Have they said...?

33:32.008 --> 33:34.068
A year, give or take.

33:36.016 --> 33:38.055
That's why Martin is over here,

33:38.056 --> 33:40.031
sorting my affairs.

33:40.032 --> 33:42.055
It's a complicated process.

33:42.056 --> 33:45.059
Boards of directors
and trustees to consider.

33:45.060 --> 33:50.052
And making sure I honour the most
loyal of my friends and associates.

33:53.052 --> 33:54.091
The thing is...

33:54.092 --> 33:56.063
..the gun was mine.

33:56.064 --> 33:59.016
I asked Martin to get it for me.

34:00.040 --> 34:03.008
And why did you need a gun?

34:04.040 --> 34:06.083
Well, I've lived my entire life
on my own terms.

34:06.084 --> 34:08.023
Always have.

34:08.024 --> 34:09.067
In every way.

34:09.068 --> 34:11.012
When I finally go...

34:12.012 --> 34:14.011
..I want to be in control
of where it happens,

34:14.012 --> 34:16.091
how it happens
and when it happens.

34:16.092 --> 34:20.998
But when I specifically asked if
anyone on Rosalie Island had a gun,

34:21.000 --> 34:23.020
you were all lying to me
when you said you didn't.

34:24.040 --> 34:25.094
When you left the island that night,

34:25.096 --> 34:28.059
we assumed you hadn't found
the gun because I'd hidden it.

34:28.060 --> 34:30.071
When I went to look for it,
it had gone.

34:30.072 --> 34:32.003
When you asked us two days ago

34:32.004 --> 34:35.014
if anyone else was on the island on
the afternoon of the shooting,

34:35.016 --> 34:38.071
we said no. And at the time, that's
what we thought.

34:38.072 --> 34:40.091
But, in light of everything,

34:40.092 --> 34:44.067
we now think someone did get
onto Rosalie Island.

34:44.068 --> 34:46.043
They found the gun,

34:46.043 --> 34:49.071
they took it, and they used it to
commit murder.

34:49.072 --> 34:51.056
Because I can promise you...

34:53.000 --> 34:54.440
..it was none of us here
that did it.

35:02.056 --> 35:04.096
Maybe Ewan Boyd was right...

35:06.028 --> 35:09.035
..and it wasn't one of them
who killed Patrice.

35:09.036 --> 35:10.087
But then, why phone Rosalie Island?

35:10.088 --> 35:14.023
He must have wanted to speak to one
of the people living there.

35:14.024 --> 35:18.003
And it can't be a coincidence
that this cushion was found

35:18.004 --> 35:21.007
only steps away
from where Patrice was killed.

35:21.008 --> 35:23.047
Which brings us back to the other
question

35:23.048 --> 35:26.035
that we still haven't
answered. How did they do it?

35:26.036 --> 35:28.027
There's no boat on Rosalie
Island,

35:28.028 --> 35:29.999
no-one went to pick them up,

35:30.000 --> 35:32.011
and it's too far to swim
in 20 minutes.

35:32.012 --> 35:35.092
So how did they get to the mainland,
commit murder and back again?

35:39.048 --> 35:41.003
My dad used to say,

35:41.004 --> 35:43.031
when he was stuck on a case,

35:43.032 --> 35:44.083
"If you've stopped moving forward,

35:44.084 --> 35:47.020
"then the best thing
to do is to go back."

35:53.064 --> 35:55.024
I'm going back to Belle Mer.

36:09.076 --> 36:11.000
Just the one, please.

36:29.024 --> 36:30.096
You don't understand.

36:31.096 --> 36:33.071
You don't understand.

36:33.072 --> 36:35.059
Welcome to Rosalie Island,
Inspector.

36:35.060 --> 36:37.003
You don't understand.

36:37.004 --> 36:39.051
We're very close.
I loved her.

36:39.052 --> 36:41.071
I'm arresting you on suspicion
of murder.

36:41.072 --> 36:43.067
FLORENCE: Sir? Sir?

36:43.068 --> 36:45.071
Sir?

36:45.072 --> 36:47.095
Florence!

36:47.096 --> 36:50.007
You've been discharged?

36:50.008 --> 36:51.288
I didn't know where to go, so...

36:54.028 --> 36:55.052
So you came here.

36:57.004 --> 36:58.063
Sir.

36:58.064 --> 37:00.012
You're leaking.

37:01.064 --> 37:03.071
Oh, yes, so I am.

37:03.072 --> 37:04.084
Must be a crack in it.

37:07.064 --> 37:08.075
Here.

37:08.076 --> 37:10.024
Thank you.

37:11.032 --> 37:13.071
I'm afraid I haven't managed to
catch the person

37:13.072 --> 37:15.027
who did this to you. I'm sorry.

37:15.028 --> 37:17.096
It's OK. I know you will.

37:28.072 --> 37:31.015
I never thought of that!

37:31.016 --> 37:33.015
That's why it was there,

37:33.016 --> 37:35.063
like this tissue is here.

37:35.064 --> 37:39.031
Well, then, that would make
sense of it. Yes, absolute sense,

37:39.032 --> 37:40.068
now that I think of it.

37:42.064 --> 37:44.032
And if I'm right about this...

37:46.032 --> 37:49.059
Well, then, that's why you'd bring
a cushion along to a murder!

37:49.060 --> 37:52.063
Although the previous owners
left a little skiff behind,

37:52.064 --> 37:54.067
but it had a hole in it, right?

37:54.068 --> 37:56.043
Chucked it out, few years back.

37:56.044 --> 37:59.060
Why would someone put a
lovely-looking cushion in a bag?

38:01.032 --> 38:04.071
We searched that island high up and
low down, there was no boat there.

38:04.072 --> 38:06.064
Which way to the house?
I'll show you.

38:08.088 --> 38:12.027
Well, isn't that the darnedest
thing? You know what happened?

38:12.028 --> 38:14.048
Well, I need to get back to the
station.

38:16.060 --> 38:18.031
JP, I need you to arrange a
dive team,

38:18.032 --> 38:21.031
and get them over to that stretch of
water near the crime scene.

38:21.032 --> 38:23.059
Sarge? What are they
looking for, sir?

38:23.060 --> 38:25.035
I'm OK.
A boat, JP.

38:25.036 --> 38:26.095
A lit... A little boat.

38:26.096 --> 38:29.008
I'm on my way.

38:34.072 --> 38:38.000
Ah, yes! Here we go.

38:39.068 --> 38:40.083
What are those?

38:40.084 --> 38:42.063
The e-mails Tiana wrote.

38:42.064 --> 38:44.031
The answer has to be
in them somewhere.

38:44.032 --> 38:46.072
HE MUMBLES

38:49.068 --> 38:52.068
What was this really all about?

38:59.072 --> 39:01.012
Magnifying glass!

39:09.056 --> 39:11.008
My goodness!

39:13.004 --> 39:14.055
Who's this?

39:14.056 --> 39:15.087
Tiana Palmer's birth mother.

39:15.088 --> 39:18.035
"I understand your desire
to get to know Mr Boyd better.

39:18.036 --> 39:20.059
"But maybe some time apart
might be more advisable."

39:20.060 --> 39:22.039
If you're forced to face your
final days,

39:22.040 --> 39:24.055
you might as well do it
somewhere sunny, eh?

39:24.056 --> 39:27.031
At last! At last it makes
some flaming sense.

39:27.032 --> 39:29.027
Ruby, grab the crime scene kit.

39:29.028 --> 39:32.068
I need you to do
some fingerprint dusting. Yes, sir.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.063
We're going to Rosalie Island?

39:35.064 --> 39:38.075
Oh, Florence, I...

39:38.076 --> 39:40.027
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

39:40.028 --> 39:41.075
I mean, you don't want to have to...

39:41.076 --> 39:43.063
No.

39:43.064 --> 39:45.087
I want to know who did this to me.

39:45.088 --> 39:47.012
To Patrice.

39:57.060 --> 40:01.019
Three days ago,

40:01.020 --> 40:03.047
after Harrison Green was arrested,

40:03.048 --> 40:07.071
at 1.30 in the afternoon, Patrice
Campbell phoned this villa.

40:07.072 --> 40:09.035
Now, why did he call here?

40:09.036 --> 40:12.059
Well, I think he was confused
and frustrated.

40:12.060 --> 40:16.051
His best friend, in his mind, had
been wrongfully arrested for murder.

40:16.052 --> 40:20.055
And having heard that a top lawyer
was visiting Rosalie Island,

40:20.056 --> 40:22.095
he called here
to try and enlist your help.

40:22.096 --> 40:25.088
But it wasn't Martin
who answered the phone.

40:27.060 --> 40:31.039
It was Frances. Sorry?
What?! That's ridiculous!

40:31.040 --> 40:33.052
PHONE RINGS

40:34.080 --> 40:37.007
JACK: Patrice...
Hello?

40:37.008 --> 40:40.031
Then we need to talk... voiced his
belief that Harrison was innocent,

40:40.032 --> 40:41.075
and you started to worry.

40:41.076 --> 40:43.023
To contain the situation

40:43.024 --> 40:46.023
and make sure Patrice didn't
speak to anyone else,

40:46.024 --> 40:48.087
you needed to meet him in person,
as quickly as possible.

40:48.088 --> 40:52.048
Which brings us to the part
of this case that made no sense.

40:53.052 --> 40:57.023
How did you manage to make
it all the way to Saint Marie

40:57.024 --> 41:00.023
and back again without any means
of transport?

41:00.024 --> 41:02.035
Well, as it turns out,

41:02.036 --> 41:06.003
there was a way for Frances to
return here after the shooting -

41:06.004 --> 41:10.047
on the same boat that we
travelled to Rosalie Island on.

41:10.048 --> 41:13.031
Not a particularly big boat,
but there was a little area

41:13.032 --> 41:17.023
where you could remain hidden,
unnoticed, under a tarpaulin.

41:17.024 --> 41:21.079
I have just had Officer Patterson
dust that area for prints,

41:21.080 --> 41:25.095
and you'll never guess what she
found. Prints belonging to...

41:25.096 --> 41:27.087
..Frances Compton,

41:27.088 --> 41:32.040
found on the tarpaulin
and on the fuel canisters.

41:35.056 --> 41:37.063
So we know how you got back here,

41:37.064 --> 41:40.071
but how did you make it over to
Saint Marie in the first place?

41:40.072 --> 41:43.023
You told us yourself the only
boat on Rosalie Island

41:43.024 --> 41:46.003
had been chucked out a
few years ago.

41:46.004 --> 41:47.164
But that was an outright lie.

41:49.052 --> 41:52.035
While Ewan was right about
the boat having a hole in it,

41:52.036 --> 41:56.011
I think you still kept it in the
shed down near the beach.

41:56.012 --> 41:57.048
What?

42:02.092 --> 42:06.032
I found this near
where Patrice was shot.

42:08.080 --> 42:11.095
You've some experience with
boats, I believe, Frances?

42:11.096 --> 42:15.007
We both have. We've been on
countless sailing holidays.

42:15.008 --> 42:18.011
Well, I just checked with our
boatman, Barney, on the way over.

42:18.012 --> 42:21.027
And apparently,
if your vessel's gaining water,

42:21.028 --> 42:23.059
the first thing you need is
something waterproof

42:23.060 --> 42:27.091
to plug the hole. But also something
that will expand outwards

42:27.092 --> 42:31.056
to keep the plug in place. Like
a cushion in a plastic bag.

42:39.012 --> 42:40.084
Now, let's be clear.

42:42.044 --> 42:44.039
I don't think you went
to Saint Marie

42:44.040 --> 42:46.055
with the intention
of killing Patrice.

42:46.056 --> 42:48.095
But you were worried that he was
onto you in some way.

42:48.096 --> 42:51.083
And so, as insurance,
you took the gun.

42:51.084 --> 42:54.047
I have no idea what was said
between you that afternoon,

42:54.048 --> 42:57.039
but one thing I do know.
When his fiancee,

42:57.040 --> 43:00.079
an officer in the Saint Marie police
force, turned up,

43:00.080 --> 43:03.043
that's when things started to
change.

43:03.044 --> 43:05.015
And you panicked.

43:05.016 --> 43:07.999
If Patrice spoke to Florence

43:08.000 --> 43:10.015
and the police started to look
into what had gone on,

43:10.016 --> 43:13.003
well, then your involvement
in Tiana Palmer's murder

43:13.004 --> 43:14.096
would be exposed.
Patrice?

43:20.036 --> 43:22.035
And that's why you had to
silence Patrice.

43:22.036 --> 43:23.079
And you hit him.

43:23.080 --> 43:26.059
Which explains the bruising on his
head. You knocked him out.

43:26.060 --> 43:27.088
METALLIC CLANG

43:29.052 --> 43:31.031
JACK: But DS Cassell was
still a threat.

43:31.032 --> 43:33.087
FLORENCE: Look, whatever it is, I
can help, OK?

43:33.088 --> 43:36.047
If she saw you and Patrice's
unconscious body,

43:36.048 --> 43:39.007
well, then your secret
would still come out.

43:39.008 --> 43:41.023
Do you know something
about Harrison?

43:41.024 --> 43:44.060
And you decided you had no
choice but to act.

43:55.044 --> 43:57.048
Unknown to you, she wasn't dead.

43:58.084 --> 44:03.003
She was able to call us and
alert us as to where she was.

44:03.004 --> 44:07.023
But with Patrice as good as a
witness to you committing murder...

44:07.024 --> 44:08.075
Florence...

44:08.076 --> 44:10.020
..you had to shoot him, too.

44:11.052 --> 44:13.004
In his case, killing him.

44:21.012 --> 44:24.000
PHONE RINGS

44:26.004 --> 44:28.084
JP, I'm putting you on
speakerphone.

44:30.060 --> 44:32.003
They've found it, sir.

44:32.004 --> 44:35.027
A small skiff
about ten feet out.

44:35.028 --> 44:38.020
And there's a name painted
on it. "Rosalie".

44:43.000 --> 44:45.079
Forced to adjust your plan,
you realised you couldn't go back

44:45.080 --> 44:48.027
to Rosalie Island on your skiff
or you might be seen.

44:48.028 --> 44:49.071
So you decided to get rid of it.

44:49.072 --> 44:52.015
You pulled out the plug
you'd made earlier

44:52.016 --> 44:54.035
and you let the boat sink out
of sight.

44:54.036 --> 44:57.039
As for the gun, well, I assume,
as we never found it,

44:57.040 --> 44:58.087
you just lobbed it into the sea.

44:58.088 --> 45:01.031
And then you stayed out of
sight yourself.

45:01.032 --> 45:03.071
Waiting. Biding your time.

45:03.072 --> 45:07.043
Until our boat arrived.

45:07.044 --> 45:10.035
You were trapped,
with no way of getting back.

45:10.036 --> 45:13.015
So as soon as the boat
was left unattended,

45:13.016 --> 45:16.016
you seized your opportunity
and you went on board.

45:20.068 --> 45:25.011
You found a place to hide, a place
so risky you knew we'd never suspect

45:25.012 --> 45:28.011
that all along Patrice's killer
was right there next to us,

45:28.012 --> 45:31.079
on the same boat we were
using to get to Rosalie Island.

45:31.080 --> 45:33.064
And when we arrived here,
you snuck away.

45:36.084 --> 45:38.032
We had no idea you were there.

45:44.028 --> 45:47.023
I'm sure you knew a quicker way back
to the house than we did.

45:47.024 --> 45:50.003
So, when you appeared at the
house,

45:50.004 --> 45:52.015
as if you'd been there all
afternoon,

45:52.016 --> 45:53.095
well, nobody was any the wiser.

45:53.096 --> 45:55.044
I'll deal with it.

45:59.036 --> 46:02.040
But why? Why... why did any
of this happen?

46:07.028 --> 46:10.027
This is Tiana's birth mother.

46:10.028 --> 46:12.023
She was adopted, Tiana,

46:12.024 --> 46:14.092
and she was raised over
there, in Belle Mer.

46:16.092 --> 46:21.003
She was left with this photo as her
only connection to her real mum,

46:21.004 --> 46:22.059
who she's never known.

46:22.060 --> 46:25.056
Do you recognise her, Ewan?

46:28.004 --> 46:31.031
This was years ago, right?

46:31.032 --> 46:34.011
23 years ago, to be precise.

46:34.012 --> 46:38.003
Marie Forrest. Or MF, as you carved
into the wood

46:38.004 --> 46:39.059
on your arbour down there.

46:39.060 --> 46:40.076
I wonder who MF is?

46:43.004 --> 46:45.039
We had fun. She stayed here for a
couple of months.

46:45.040 --> 46:46.059
I liked her.

46:46.060 --> 46:49.051
But it didn't come to
anything. Not for you, maybe.

46:49.052 --> 46:51.027
But for Marie, it did.

46:51.028 --> 46:53.999
She had a daughter. Your daughter.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.004
Tiana.

46:58.096 --> 47:01.027
And when Tiana came here
that first night,

47:01.028 --> 47:03.088
she had no idea that you
were her dad.

47:07.012 --> 47:09.072
Welcome to Rosalie Island.
I'm Ewan.

47:12.020 --> 47:14.008
But there was something she
saw here.

47:17.092 --> 47:19.060
Now, that's when she first
realised.

47:23.048 --> 47:26.004
Summer of 1996,
the time she was conceived.

47:27.024 --> 47:30.003
And if, like us, she also saw the
carving, well,

47:30.004 --> 47:32.011
I imagine she put two and
two together.

47:32.012 --> 47:34.027
Is that what happened, Frances?

47:34.028 --> 47:36.060
I tried to put her off the scent,
but she knew.

47:37.072 --> 47:40.071
She just knew. She said she could
feel it when she met him -

47:40.072 --> 47:42.048
Ewan was her father.

47:43.080 --> 47:46.047
And she wanted a DNA test.

47:46.048 --> 47:49.003
And I knew what the result
was going be,

47:49.004 --> 47:51.087
and it was all going to come
out sooner or later.

47:51.088 --> 47:53.091
So you decided she needed to die?

47:53.092 --> 47:56.063
Why, why, why did she need
to die?

47:56.064 --> 48:00.059
You said to me the other day,
Ewan, in your will,

48:00.060 --> 48:03.072
you wanted your most loyal friends
and your colleagues to be rewarded.

48:05.064 --> 48:09.028
Now, would I be right in thinking
that Frances does particularly well?

48:11.000 --> 48:12.031
Yeah.

48:12.032 --> 48:14.024
I've left her half my estate...

48:16.000 --> 48:19.007
..and a controlling
share of the business.

48:19.008 --> 48:21.075
If you found out you had a
daughter, well, then,

48:21.076 --> 48:25.011
no doubt, you would want to provide
for that daughter after you'd gone.

48:25.012 --> 48:28.087
It would be her that would inherit
the lion's share of the estate,

48:28.088 --> 48:29.096
your business...

48:31.044 --> 48:34.063
And that's why Tiana had to die.

48:34.064 --> 48:38.059
I don't understand. Why would this
Harrison bloke

48:38.060 --> 48:40.056
kill Tiana for Frances?

48:42.040 --> 48:46.031
Because he didn't know
he was doing it for her.

48:46.032 --> 48:48.999
Patrice had grown up with Harrison.

48:49.000 --> 48:53.040
They were best friends. And he swore
Harrison was gentle.

48:54.072 --> 48:56.059
He didn't have it in him to kill.

48:56.060 --> 48:59.007
PATRICE: He's good.
He's kind, gentle.

48:59.008 --> 49:01.051
You can't seriously
think he killed Tiana.

49:01.052 --> 49:02.095
So how come he became this man

49:02.096 --> 49:05.047
who was so angry with Tiana
that he had to kill her?

49:05.048 --> 49:07.088
I was bursting with pain.

49:09.080 --> 49:11.056
I needed to make it stop.

49:12.096 --> 49:17.059
Well, because, on their frequent
trips to and from Saint Marie,

49:17.060 --> 49:20.071
Frances had started to poison
Harrison's thoughts.

49:20.072 --> 49:24.051
Harrison was in a vulnerable
state. He... he was under pressure.

49:24.052 --> 49:27.003
His business was struggling.
He had debts.

49:27.004 --> 49:29.087
And his girlfriend was having doubts
about their relationship.

49:29.088 --> 49:33.075
He was ripe, in other words, for
Frances to drip-feed into his head

49:33.076 --> 49:37.095
how unbearable his hurt would be at
losing the love of his life.

49:37.096 --> 49:41.075
You're very good at getting
people to do what you want,
aren't you, Frances?

49:41.076 --> 49:43.079
I mean, it's your job,
let's be honest here.

49:43.080 --> 49:47.999
It's always been a skill of mine -
managing people's expectations,

49:48.000 --> 49:52.059
helping them... come around
to my way of thinking.

49:52.060 --> 49:56.011
And that's what you did
with Harrison Green.

49:56.012 --> 49:57.083
You cleverly, subtly,

49:57.084 --> 50:03.003
wantonly worked him up into thinking
the only way out of this situation

50:03.004 --> 50:05.007
was to commit murder.

50:05.008 --> 50:08.052
You... you twisted his mind
against Tiana.

50:09.068 --> 50:11.043
Gaslighting is one word for it.

50:11.044 --> 50:15.087
Manipulating someone into
questioning their own sanity.

50:15.088 --> 50:20.003
And to this day, Harrison doesn't
know what you did.

50:20.004 --> 50:23.068
But we know. You brainwashed him
into killing Tiana.

50:25.024 --> 50:29.040
And then you murdered
Patrice to cover it up.

50:31.020 --> 50:33.079
Because of you,
a mother and a father

50:33.080 --> 50:35.063
have lost their only daughter,

50:35.064 --> 50:37.019
and a young woman

50:37.020 --> 50:40.012
has lost the man she wanted to spend
the rest of her life with.

50:45.032 --> 50:48.023
Ruby, you can make the arrest.
Yes, sir.

50:48.024 --> 50:49.032
No.

50:50.084 --> 50:52.051
I will.

50:52.052 --> 50:53.060
Yes, Sarge.

51:07.068 --> 51:09.032
Frances Compton...

51:10.072 --> 51:12.016
FRANCES CLEARS THROAT

51:15.032 --> 51:16.092
I'm arresting you...

51:17.096 --> 51:20.032
..for the murder
of Patrice Campbell.

52:01.052 --> 52:04.095
You handled yourself with real
dignity back there, Florence.

52:04.096 --> 52:06.096
Thank you, sir.

52:13.016 --> 52:15.016
I've been thinking about what
you said.

52:16.048 --> 52:18.056
How you dealt with losing
your wife, and...

52:20.004 --> 52:21.036
..I realised...

52:24.004 --> 52:25.079
..you came here.

52:25.080 --> 52:28.076
You left everything behind
and you made a new start.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.036
Well, yes, I...

52:34.052 --> 52:36.020
..I guess I did.

52:37.060 --> 52:39.024
Wasn't planned, though.

52:40.056 --> 52:41.064
Just happened.

52:45.044 --> 52:47.087
Well, I think that's what I need
to do, too.

52:47.088 --> 52:49.056
For a while, at least.

52:52.016 --> 52:54.011
Go away?

52:54.012 --> 52:56.012
Saint Marie is a small island,
and...

52:57.040 --> 52:59.043
..I don't think there's
anywhere here

52:59.044 --> 53:01.096
that doesn't have a memory
of Patrice in it.

53:03.060 --> 53:06.011
So maybe if I... go
somewhere else,

53:06.012 --> 53:08.079
I can just pretend I'm
someone else.

53:08.080 --> 53:11.043
Oh, now, please don't do that.

53:11.044 --> 53:13.084
You're pretty perfect
as you are.

53:16.076 --> 53:19.096
I have some family on Martinique, so
I think I'm going to stay with them.

53:21.040 --> 53:22.072
After that...

53:24.024 --> 53:25.044
..who knows where?

53:29.000 --> 53:33.016
And if I'm sad, maybe I can just
call you, and you can make me laugh.

53:39.056 --> 53:40.068
It's a deal.

53:46.032 --> 53:47.088
I'll miss you.

53:49.096 --> 53:51.064
The feeling's entirely mutual.

54:09.028 --> 54:11.067
JP: It won't be the same
without you, Sarge.

54:11.068 --> 54:13.083
RUBY: Thank you so much,
DS Cassell.

54:13.084 --> 54:15.072
FLORENCE: Thank you.

54:17.060 --> 54:21.008
Well, I guess, erm, this
is it, then.

54:23.096 --> 54:25.083
Well, I'll just go
and put your bags in the boot.

54:25.084 --> 54:27.092
Yeah. I'll give you a hand,
sir.Yeah.

54:33.020 --> 54:37.067
You know, I really don't want you to
leave, Sarge.

54:37.068 --> 54:41.032
But... you'll come back and
visit, right? Of course.

54:42.040 --> 54:44.071
Martinique is not so far.

54:44.072 --> 54:46.027
We could all come visit you.

54:46.028 --> 54:48.059
I'd like that.

54:48.060 --> 54:51.051
I'm sorry we're losing you
in these circumstances,

54:51.052 --> 54:54.019
but I understand your decision.

54:54.020 --> 54:57.027
Just know how grateful I am
personally

54:57.028 --> 54:59.064
for everything you've done
for this island.

55:01.072 --> 55:04.016
Well, you're just so uptight,
Uncle Selly.

55:12.052 --> 55:15.032
Go on, give her some
goodbye love.

55:35.068 --> 55:36.088
You OK, sir?

55:38.000 --> 55:39.024
Yeah.

55:40.036 --> 55:42.091
Well, your carriage awaits.

55:42.092 --> 55:44.048
Can't believe I'm going.

55:50.028 --> 55:53.007
You look after yourself, Sarge,

55:53.008 --> 55:55.999
and if there's anything you
need, just call us.

55:56.000 --> 55:57.012
I will.

56:03.076 --> 56:05.999
Well, I never said it before,

56:06.000 --> 56:07.095
so I'm just going to go ahead
and say it.

56:07.096 --> 56:10.051
Thank you, Detective Sergeant
Florence Cassell.

56:10.052 --> 56:12.051
What for?

56:12.052 --> 56:16.004
For being my friend from the moment
I set foot on this island.

56:19.028 --> 56:21.056
Goodbye, sir.

56:23.000 --> 56:26.040
Jack, please. For the love of God,
call me Jack.

56:32.068 --> 56:34.052
Take care.

56:36.004 --> 56:37.012
Goodbye, Jack.

56:40.016 --> 56:43.068
Bye, Sarge. See you later, Sarge.
We're going to miss you.

56:58.056 --> 57:00.999
And if you're feeling
like there's no point to it all,

57:01.000 --> 57:04.007
just look at the ring on your
finger,

57:04.008 --> 57:06.007
who it represents,

57:06.008 --> 57:08.064
and think, what would he
want for you?

57:20.044 --> 57:22.079
Got a new song to add
to tonight's playlist.

57:22.080 --> 57:24.011
Whatever you say.

57:24.012 --> 57:26.055
All right, everybody,
Dezzie Dixon here.

57:26.056 --> 57:29.027
GUNSHOT Oh, Lord...

57:29.028 --> 57:31.075
They think it's MY fault
that Florence got shot?

57:31.076 --> 57:34.031
They're sending someone
over from Internal Affairs.

57:34.032 --> 57:37.035
I am Detective Sergeant Madeleine
Dumas, Internal Affairs.

57:37.036 --> 57:39.083
I'm sure you and your team
are extremely professional.

57:39.084 --> 57:42.039
Welcome to Saint Marie. I think
you're going to have to start

57:42.040 --> 57:43.080
looking for a replacement.
