WEBVTT

00:03.155 --> 00:05.611
- Vinnie!
- Oh, look, it's my agent!

00:05.645 --> 00:08.391
Let's go reintroduce you
to the world.

00:08.425 --> 00:10.071
<i>Yeah.</i>

00:10.105 --> 00:13.123
I just think it's time for me
to make something of myself.

00:13.157 --> 00:14.599
Now you want
to branch out on your own?

00:14.634 --> 00:16.979
Happy Birthday!

00:18.587 --> 00:22.245
Have you ever considered
making a move to a bigger company?

00:22.279 --> 00:24.356
Maybe we could do
some good for each other.

00:24.390 --> 00:27.307
What's going on, Ari?

00:27.341 --> 00:28.885
They're gonna push
"Ferarri" 12 weeks.

00:28.919 --> 00:31.097
So what am I gonna do
for the next three months?

00:31.131 --> 00:32.603
Whatever you want, bro.

00:35.121 --> 00:37.697
Yeah!

00:37.736 --> 00:39.012
- Can I take you to lunch?
- Yeah.

00:39.146 --> 00:40.885
All I can think about now
is how sweet it would be

00:40.919 --> 00:44.072
to ram Tony Soprano's
daughter from behind.

00:44.106 --> 00:46.516
- I'm gonna torture you.
- I am so screwed.

00:46.550 --> 00:49.431
I want a promotion.
The time has come.

00:49.465 --> 00:51.274
I want to know
if this is gonna happen.

00:51.308 --> 00:54.088
I will not be
strong-armed, Lloyd.

00:54.122 --> 00:56.531
- You just were, Ari Gold.
- What do you want?

00:56.565 --> 00:59.144
I want to know if you want
to make a deal. Yes or no?

00:59.179 --> 01:02.191
This deal will make me the
head of the largest agency

01:02.225 --> 01:04.233
in the entire
entertainment business.

01:04.268 --> 01:06.242
Return to the king!

01:06.276 --> 01:08.351
Ari! Jesus Christ!

01:08.385 --> 01:11.397
- Eric, stop!
- I swear to God I'll marry you.

01:11.432 --> 01:13.172
And this time it'll be forever.

01:13.207 --> 01:15.011
I made this decision to leave.

01:15.045 --> 01:17.119
They want to develop
something for me to star in.

01:17.153 --> 01:19.127
It's supposed
to say "agent. "

01:19.161 --> 01:21.271
- Oh my God.
- Get off.

01:21.306 --> 01:23.043
Everybody wants to be
their own man, I guess.

01:23.077 --> 01:25.554
I believe!

03:14.490 --> 03:17.157
All right, good deal.
I'll have a girl there.

03:17.192 --> 03:21.160
You want Rachel? Yeah, Rachel
will be there, I guarantee it.

03:21.195 --> 03:23.762
Thanks.
You are wanted.

03:23.797 --> 03:25.397
- Why wouldn't I be?
- Go.

03:25.431 --> 03:27.432
- Going.
- Abby, don't hate me. You're going to Reseda.

03:27.466 --> 03:29.934
- I love Reseda.
- Sarah, I need you on the phone.

03:29.968 --> 03:32.636
<i>- What?! Where's the guy that does that?
- I fired him.</i>

03:32.670 --> 03:34.804
- He stole Vince's MTV award.
- Oh.

03:34.839 --> 03:37.274
- I'll replace him. Just do it for me today?
- Sure.

03:37.308 --> 03:39.376
- And where the hell is Alex?
- I don't know.

03:39.411 --> 03:41.879
- I'm here, I'm here!
- You're late.

03:41.913 --> 03:43.547
You're late again.

03:43.581 --> 03:46.983
L. A. is so confusing.

03:47.017 --> 03:48.817
You have a nav system.

03:48.852 --> 03:51.353
You rely too much on those,
Turtle, your brain turns to mush.

03:51.387 --> 03:52.853
You can't even find
your way home.

03:52.888 --> 03:54.689
Looks like you can't even
find your shirt.

03:54.723 --> 03:56.390
Turtle, it's okay.
She can wear mine.

03:56.424 --> 03:58.759
<i>- Yeah?
- Yeah yeah.</i>

03:58.793 --> 04:01.327
See? We're all good.
Just turn around.

04:02.562 --> 04:05.630
<i>- And don't peek, Turtle.
- I'm not peeking.</i>

04:06.799 --> 04:08.766
- Okay, where am I going?
- L. A. X.

04:08.800 --> 04:11.368
- But first you take me by Vince's set.
- Hey!

04:20.612 --> 04:23.147
<i>She taste like midnight</i>

04:23.181 --> 04:25.015
<i>she taste like wine</i>

04:26.117 --> 04:28.218

04:28.253 --> 04:30.320

04:30.354 --> 04:33.222

04:33.257 --> 04:34.957
<i>- all down her spine
- All right, send him.</i>

04:34.991 --> 04:36.859
- Ed, go!
- Send him, send him.

04:36.893 --> 04:38.994
Oh, is this where they
light him on fire?

04:39.028 --> 04:40.628
- Yup.
- Nice.

04:40.663 --> 04:43.130
<i>Gonna spread you
like butter</i>

04:43.165 --> 04:45.799
<i>gimme all of bread</i>

<i>- get into my bed...
- Jesus.</i>

04:51.805 --> 04:54.373
Don't worry, Turtle.
I'm fine.

04:54.407 --> 04:56.275
<i>Director: Cut!</i>

04:56.309 --> 04:59.744
<i>- Uh...
ro resets!</i>

05:01.614 --> 05:04.049
- What's his problem?
- Who knows?

05:04.083 --> 05:06.584
<i>- It looked good to me.
- Crewman: All right, get her, boys.</i>

05:06.619 --> 05:08.853
<i>Time to reload.</i>

05:10.455 --> 05:13.190
<i>- Hey.
- Yo yo! What's up?</i>

05:13.224 --> 05:15.792
- How're you doing?
- Good. You wanted to see me?

05:15.826 --> 05:17.727
Yeah yeah, you remember
Chuckie the producer, right?

05:17.761 --> 05:19.428
How are you doing?
Good to see you.

05:19.462 --> 05:21.963
- Everything all right?
- Yeah yeah. Chuck?

05:21.998 --> 05:24.297
Vince, check yourself out.

05:25.233 --> 05:28.067
<i>- Oh wow, awesome.
- Right?</i>

05:28.102 --> 05:30.403
Now watch this.

05:30.437 --> 05:32.838
<i>- Vince: Oh, not so good.
- Terrible!</i>

05:32.873 --> 05:36.374
- Guess we can't use that.
- No, we can't.

05:36.408 --> 05:38.575
So do we get
another double or...?

05:38.610 --> 05:40.644
We can get another double,
but it'll still be shit.

05:40.678 --> 05:43.079
<i>Not gonna look like you.</i>

05:43.113 --> 05:44.813
So what, you wanna
light me on fire?

05:44.848 --> 05:48.016
<i>- De Niro would do it.
- Look, this is an important movie for me.</i>

05:48.051 --> 05:49.784
Yeah, for me also.

05:49.819 --> 05:52.253
I don't want to bullshit the audience.
They're very smart.

05:52.288 --> 05:53.955
<i>So you do want
to light me on fire?</i>

05:53.989 --> 05:56.090
I don't want to light you on fire.
This scene's fine.

05:56.124 --> 05:59.359
The wide shot looks great.
But we do have a big chase scene coming up.

05:59.393 --> 06:02.861
And I want you to do the stunt.
Not the stuntman.

06:02.895 --> 06:04.896
You... driving that car.

06:04.930 --> 06:06.530
I want the audience
to look at you and go,

06:06.565 --> 06:08.698
"God damn, that motherfucker
is a badass. "

06:08.733 --> 06:11.968
Because if they don't, because if it looks
fake, the movie's gonna suck, Vince.

06:12.002 --> 06:14.470
And you're gonna wind up
coming off like...

06:14.504 --> 06:15.871
- Like a pussy.
- ... Like a pussy.

06:15.905 --> 06:18.206
<i>You don't want to look
like a pussy, do you?</i>

06:19.309 --> 06:21.176
This is really good.

06:21.210 --> 06:24.446
And everybody knows Johnny Drama
likes a good piece of meat.

06:24.480 --> 06:26.948
Hey, don't get fresh.
Vince, you want a burger?

06:26.982 --> 06:29.718
No, thank you. But, Turtle, see
if you can get E on the phone.

06:29.752 --> 06:31.519
Everything all right?

06:31.553 --> 06:33.221
Call me.

06:34.623 --> 06:36.456
Why didn't you just say no?

06:36.490 --> 06:38.591
<i>He was so passionate
I didn't know how to.</i>

06:38.626 --> 06:41.227
He basically said the movie
will suck if I don't do it.

06:41.261 --> 06:43.829
That's ridiculous.
I mean, he should have brought that up

06:43.863 --> 06:46.231
<i>in preproduction, or when
they were making your deal.</i>

06:46.265 --> 06:49.000
For him to try and pressure you
into doing it now is just stupid.

06:49.035 --> 06:52.937
You know, I did the fall down the
steps myself in "My so-called life. "

06:52.971 --> 06:56.339
- It was very liberating.
- And your brain hasn't worked right since.

06:56.373 --> 06:58.641
All right, E, I told Nick
I'd do it, so what now?

06:58.675 --> 07:00.309
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

07:00.343 --> 07:03.078
You better! Because if something
happens to Vince, we're all fucked.

07:03.112 --> 07:05.679
Actually only Drama is, since
he's the only one unemployed.

07:05.713 --> 07:09.315
My time is coming, driver.
In fact, I'm gonna see Yagoda today

07:09.350 --> 07:11.651
<i>to see what show the network's
ready to put me in.</i>

07:11.685 --> 07:12.919
- You coming with?
- No.

07:12.953 --> 07:14.554
<i>- Turtle.
- Why not?</i>

07:14.588 --> 07:15.955
Go with him.
He's nervous.

07:15.989 --> 07:18.690
- Fine.
- Let me go too so I can take care of this.

07:18.724 --> 07:20.391
Staff meeting is in 10 minutes.

07:20.425 --> 07:23.160
But, E, don't make me look
like I'm not a team player.

07:23.194 --> 07:25.028
<i>Don't worry, you won't.
I gotta go.</i>

07:25.063 --> 07:27.898
<i>Hey, Jennie, will you get Ari for me, please?</i>

07:27.932 --> 07:30.333
Jessica Simpson wants
to come in for some T. L. C.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.068
Says she's not
feeling the love.

07:32.102 --> 07:34.136
I think she's been down
since her dog got eaten.

07:34.170 --> 07:36.304
That was like
eight months ago, right?

07:36.338 --> 07:38.505
- So show her the love.
- She wants you.

07:38.539 --> 07:40.573
And so does Ryan Reynolds.
He says he thinks

07:40.607 --> 07:42.974
you're not speaking to him because
you no longer show up for poker.

07:43.009 --> 07:44.509
Okay, stop stop stop stop!

07:44.543 --> 07:47.512
Raj, go buy Jessica
a new cockapoo.

07:47.546 --> 07:51.083
And, Steph, tell Ryan the reason
I don't have time to play poker

07:51.117 --> 07:54.785
is because I spend my life
in here being bored to death

07:54.820 --> 07:56.720
by you people, all right?

07:56.754 --> 08:00.191
This is now the biggest
agency in the world.

08:00.226 --> 08:01.692
And I'm the head of it.

08:01.727 --> 08:03.827
<i>Which makes me the bigger
agent in the world.</i>

08:03.862 --> 08:06.830
Now can anyone tell me
why I chose

08:06.864 --> 08:09.665
to be the biggest agent
in the world?

08:11.168 --> 08:13.569
It's so I can stop being
a fucking agent!

08:13.603 --> 08:15.603
So don't tell me
to show the love.

08:15.638 --> 08:17.538
That's what I pay
you people for.

08:17.572 --> 08:21.141
All right, so somebody
give me something big.

08:21.175 --> 08:22.976
Anybody, please.

08:24.912 --> 08:27.046
<i>Jesus Christ,
you all suck.</i>

08:27.080 --> 08:29.348
If I didn't have a five-year lease
on this place, I'd shut it down

08:29.382 --> 08:31.817
and work out
of a cardboard box by myself.

08:31.851 --> 08:34.852
I just read the N. F. L.
Is getting ready to resell the TV rights.

08:34.886 --> 08:37.386
- I think they could use you.
- Everyone could use me.

08:37.422 --> 08:38.956
Who are you?
Jake Steinberg.

08:38.990 --> 08:40.924
- I used to be on your desk.
- What happened?

08:40.957 --> 08:42.759
- You threw me off.
- You're back on.

08:42.793 --> 08:44.794
- Throw the guy off who's on there now.
- Seriously?

08:44.828 --> 08:46.528
<i>- Mm-hmm. That's him.
- Ari!</i>

08:46.563 --> 08:49.164
Eric Murphy's on the phone
for you, says it's urgent.

08:49.198 --> 08:52.100
Somebody find out why we're
not selling the N. F. L. Rights.

08:52.134 --> 08:53.867
<i>- They do it internally.
- They shouldn't,</i>

08:53.902 --> 08:56.170
so somebody get me a meeting.

08:56.204 --> 08:58.905
E! Long time no hear.
You married yet?

08:58.939 --> 09:01.039
October, Ari.
I assume you'll be there.

09:01.074 --> 09:03.741
Listen, can I keep the little
groom from the top of the cake

09:03.775 --> 09:06.176
just in case Sloan never lets
you out of the house again?

09:06.210 --> 09:09.012
<i>I can carry you around in my
pocket like I always dreamed of.</i>

09:09.046 --> 09:11.381
I n shove it up your ass too.
I bet you'd love that.

09:11.415 --> 09:15.051
Feisty, E. Are your impending
nuptials making you tense?

09:15.085 --> 09:17.152
No, not at all.
I actually feel great about it.

09:17.187 --> 09:18.920
That's natural.
It'll pass.

09:18.955 --> 09:21.590
Oh, come on, Ari. You're the
perfect picture of marital bliss.

09:21.624 --> 09:23.626
Like a hostage
with a machete to his neck,

09:23.660 --> 09:25.694
you have to put
on a good face for the camera.

09:25.728 --> 09:27.528
<i>- You're all talk.
- Yeah, maybe.</i>

09:27.563 --> 09:29.463
<i>- What's up?
- Nick Cassavetes.</i>

09:29.497 --> 09:31.065
<i>What about him?</i>

09:31.099 --> 09:32.899
He wants Vince to do
his own stunt.

09:32.934 --> 09:35.269
He comes from a family
of method actors.

09:35.304 --> 09:38.005
They'll eat glass if it's in the script.
Tell him no.

09:38.039 --> 09:40.273
<i>He already said
he would do it.</i>

09:40.308 --> 09:42.275
He wants to do it?

09:43.544 --> 09:45.345
- He wants to be a team player.
- Jesus Christ.

09:45.379 --> 09:48.914
<i>- You represent the guy.
- I represent everyone now, Eric.</i>

09:48.948 --> 09:51.883
- Can you take care of this or not?
- I can do anything.

09:51.917 --> 09:54.785
<i>- Will you take care of this?
- Fine, all right.</i>

09:56.788 --> 09:58.789
Try Nick Cassavetes.

09:58.823 --> 10:01.925
And did anyone get a meeting
with the goddamned N. F. L. yet?

10:03.861 --> 10:06.328
- Hey, Phil, how are ya?
- I'm good.

10:06.363 --> 10:08.964
I'm good, John.
How are you?

10:08.965 --> 10:10.765
A little anxious, to be honest,

10:10.800 --> 10:12.767
since you wanted
to see me face to face.

10:12.801 --> 10:15.736
Let's smoke up, John.

10:15.771 --> 10:19.106
- Smoke up? In here?
- Yeah yeah, eh, fuck it.

10:19.140 --> 10:22.275
You're anxious.
It's medicinal.

10:22.309 --> 10:25.611
Smoke up and you'll be
anxious no more.

10:26.680 --> 10:28.347
Okay.

10:28.381 --> 10:30.682
So is this a celebratory
smoke, Phil?

10:30.716 --> 10:33.317
Afraid not, John.

10:34.319 --> 10:36.219
Really?

10:38.922 --> 10:41.991
- Have a drink, John.
- Phil, I don't need a drink. I need a job.

10:42.025 --> 10:44.893
- Drink drink, come on.
- You must have something for me.

10:44.927 --> 10:46.761
Afraid not.

10:46.795 --> 10:49.730
I don't understand.
You have three shows you're ready to make.

10:49.764 --> 10:51.731
I'm ready to produce them.

10:51.765 --> 10:53.599
The network's not ready
to make them.

10:53.634 --> 10:55.635
None of them?

10:55.669 --> 10:58.737
Well, you know.
Sit down, sit down, come on.

10:58.771 --> 11:01.073
But "The fall guy" remake
could be awesome!

11:01.107 --> 11:03.508
We get Minka Kelly
for the Heather Thomas part...

11:03.542 --> 11:05.143
It's not gonna happen.

11:08.413 --> 11:11.882
Jesus.
So now what?

11:11.916 --> 11:14.918
Well, you got eight weeks
left on your deal.

11:14.952 --> 11:17.987
We have to find something
before it runs out.

11:18.021 --> 11:19.622
Find it where?

11:19.656 --> 11:21.957
I'm reading everything
that I can get my hands on.

11:21.992 --> 11:24.726
- But you gotta do your part.
- What can I do?

11:24.761 --> 11:26.628
Talk to your agent.

11:26.662 --> 11:30.198
You put on a full-court press
and do it fast.

11:35.036 --> 11:37.204
Alex, you go to the airport
at least twice a week.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.039
I don't understand
how you can get lost.

11:39.073 --> 11:42.142
There was traffic on the freeway so I got
off and tried to take the side streets.

11:42.176 --> 11:45.111
<i>And then this creepy looking
cholo started following me</i>

11:45.146 --> 11:47.046
<i>and he freaked me out
so I turned off.</i>

11:47.081 --> 11:49.281
Not every guy that drives
by you is following you.

11:49.315 --> 11:51.182
<i>He didn't just
drive by me, Turtle.</i>

11:51.216 --> 11:55.185
He rolled his window down and said,
"hey, baby, pull over. Let's fuck. "

11:56.420 --> 11:58.154
<i>- Where are you now?
- I don't know.</i>

11:58.188 --> 12:01.490
Oh... oh, wait! I see a sign.
I got it, I got it.

12:01.524 --> 12:03.291
<i>- We're all good.
- Okay, good.</i>

12:03.326 --> 12:06.394
<i>Oh come on, let me in, you cocksucker!</i>

12:06.428 --> 12:09.363
- I gotta focus, Turtle. Bye.
- Bye.

12:09.398 --> 12:13.366
- How'd it go?
- I got eight weeks till I'm homeless.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.602
- What's your problem?
- Nothing.

12:15.636 --> 12:18.238
- That Alex driver again?
- Yeah.

12:18.272 --> 12:20.539
- You gotta get rid of her.
- Yeah.

12:20.574 --> 12:22.741
- Yeah what?
- Yeah, I gotta get rid of her.

12:22.776 --> 12:25.442
This is your business, Turtle.
Stop thinking with your dick.

12:25.477 --> 12:27.610
Worry about your own
business, all right?

12:27.645 --> 12:30.947
Oh, I am. And wait till
you see how I handle it.

12:34.951 --> 12:37.552
You were supposed to meet me
at the school, Ari.

12:37.587 --> 12:40.655
I know, baby, but I got something
that I can't get out of.

12:40.689 --> 12:42.790
What am I gonna tell
your son's teacher?

12:42.825 --> 12:45.192
Tell her that I got something
that I can't get out of.

12:45.227 --> 12:48.662
I thought you said at this new agency
there'd always be someone to cover for you.

12:48.696 --> 12:50.464
<i>Even with a million-man army</i>

12:50.498 --> 12:52.632
<i>sometimes you gotta do
the grunt work yourself.</i>

12:52.667 --> 12:55.635
Saddam Hussein had to hang a
few without assistance, no?

12:55.669 --> 12:57.569
I like it when we do
these things together.

12:57.604 --> 12:59.838
Tell the school
that when they schedule

12:59.872 --> 13:02.274
a parent-teacher conference
for 2:30 on a weekday

13:02.308 --> 13:05.110
that's just their way of saying
"we don't care about daddy. "

13:05.144 --> 13:07.912
If I get her to change it
to tomorrow, will you be there?

13:07.946 --> 13:09.878
With bells on.
Kisses, baby.

13:09.912 --> 13:11.646
Goodbye.

13:11.680 --> 13:15.616
<i>Man: You gotta hit this thing somewhere
between a 30° and a 50° angle.</i>

13:15.650 --> 13:18.285
Anything more, anything less
and you got problems.

13:18.320 --> 13:20.420
What kind of problems?

13:20.454 --> 13:23.122
Big problems, you understand?

13:24.023 --> 13:25.356
<i>- Ari!
- Vinnie!</i>

13:25.390 --> 13:27.458
- Would you excuse me for a moment?
- Yeah yeah.

13:27.493 --> 13:30.361
Ari, I'm so happy to see you.
They got me looking at models over here.

13:30.395 --> 13:33.830
Not to worry. I'm going to take care of
what your little man couldn't, all right?

13:33.864 --> 13:35.998
- This gonna be a huge problem?
- No, not at all.

13:35.999 --> 13:38.133
Listen, don't worry.
Where's Nick?

13:38.168 --> 13:40.035
- He's over by his trailer.
- All right.

13:40.069 --> 13:41.836
Ari, don't make me look bad.

13:41.871 --> 13:44.071
Have I ever?

13:44.106 --> 13:46.440
<i>You know, I'd like
to meet you, baby...</i>

13:46.474 --> 13:49.376
- I bet 2,000.
- Fuck you. I'm all in.

13:49.410 --> 13:52.345
<i>That's where
she wants to go...</i>

13:55.248 --> 13:57.516
Oh God.
Deal me out.

13:57.550 --> 13:59.384
- Hello, Ari.
- What, no call back?

13:59.418 --> 14:02.487
I know, I know.
Look, Vince wants to do the stunt.

14:02.521 --> 14:03.888
I don't want him to.

14:03.923 --> 14:06.291
Well, you're my agent also
and that's what I want.

14:06.325 --> 14:07.959
Nick, it's not gonna happen.
I'm shutting it down.

14:07.993 --> 14:09.427
- You are?
- That's right.

14:09.461 --> 14:11.395
- And how are you doing that?
- By telling you not to do it.

14:11.429 --> 14:14.598
You'd better be careful, Ari.
I'm not fucking Chad McQueen.

14:14.632 --> 14:17.734
I can't believe that the studio's
not concerned about this thing.

14:17.768 --> 14:20.169
How are they even insuring it?

14:20.203 --> 14:23.438
They don't know?
Are you out of your fucking mind?

14:23.472 --> 14:25.373
Listen, Ari,
you tell the studio

14:25.407 --> 14:27.975
and I'll break your fucking head.
How about that?

14:28.009 --> 14:30.010
- Have a nice day.
- All right.

14:31.680 --> 14:34.048
I mean it, Ari.

14:34.082 --> 14:36.350
<i>- How is everything?
- Excellent.</i>

14:36.384 --> 14:38.585
- Great as always, Stefan.
- Thank you.

14:38.619 --> 14:40.587
I don't want to go
back to work.

14:40.621 --> 14:43.855
Can't we just fantasize
about Greece over dessert?

14:43.890 --> 14:46.591
- I'd love to, but I have to go back to work.
- I know you do.

14:46.625 --> 14:49.227
Thanks for taking the time
out of your busy day for me.

14:49.261 --> 14:51.896
Every chance I get.

14:51.931 --> 14:53.998
It's Ari.
Hello.

14:54.032 --> 14:56.133
Call the studio.
Tell them that you're concerned

14:56.167 --> 14:58.335
that Nick will kill your client.
All will be well.

14:58.369 --> 15:01.337
But make sure that it doesn't
come from me or I will kill you.

15:01.372 --> 15:03.372
You know, Ari, for the most
powerful agent in the world,

15:03.406 --> 15:05.207
sometimes you're a real pussy.

15:05.241 --> 15:07.208
I will read every single script

15:07.243 --> 15:09.909
that comes through this door, Johnny Drama.
That is a promise!

15:09.944 --> 15:12.111
Hundreds of scripts must
come through here every day.

15:12.145 --> 15:15.013
I'm like Evelyn Wood.
I just speed-read right through them.

15:15.048 --> 15:17.515
Yet we haven't found one
that the studio will make.

15:17.549 --> 15:19.050
You're not blaming that on me?

15:19.084 --> 15:21.918
This is my livelihood, Lloyd,
and my dream.

15:21.953 --> 15:23.686
You don't think I know that?

15:23.721 --> 15:25.988
You're just one man, Lloyd.

15:26.023 --> 15:28.257
- I need a team.
- A team?

15:28.291 --> 15:30.726
Team Drama.

15:30.760 --> 15:33.862
It's Alex again.
I'm sorry, I've got to take this.

15:33.896 --> 15:36.697
- What happened now?
- Johnny.

15:36.732 --> 15:38.966
What's really going on here?

15:39.000 --> 15:42.301
I got eight weeks to get a show,
so I want a team assigned to me,

15:42.336 --> 15:45.537
a team whose sole purpose is to
focus on finding me this show.

15:45.571 --> 15:47.039
I don't have
the manpower for that.

15:47.073 --> 15:49.075
I thought this was the biggest
agency in the world.

15:49.109 --> 15:50.777
I'm not authorized
to provide that.

15:50.811 --> 15:53.045
Then I need to speak
to the man that is.

15:53.080 --> 15:55.714
Alex lost the car. I gotta go to the airport.
You wanna give me a ride?

15:55.749 --> 15:58.817
- No, I'm meeting Ari.
- Later.

15:58.851 --> 16:00.952
- But get rid of her!
- Johnny!

16:00.986 --> 16:03.888
- Ari's not here.
- Who's that then?

16:03.922 --> 16:05.956
Hey, Ari, could I have a word?

16:05.991 --> 16:07.724
- With who?
- With you.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.526
Uh, you have an Agent.

16:09.560 --> 16:12.796
- He's not delivering me what I need.
- No? What do you need?

16:12.831 --> 16:14.831
He wants a team, Ari.

16:14.866 --> 16:16.133
- You want a team?
- Yeah.

16:16.167 --> 16:18.601
You mean like how
Brad Pitt has a team?

16:18.635 --> 16:20.636
Well, yeah. If I get
the right show on the air,

16:20.670 --> 16:22.738
I can be worth as much
as Brad Pitt.

16:22.772 --> 16:24.306
Look at Kiefer.

16:24.340 --> 16:27.242
Ari, you know how hard I
worked to get to this point

16:27.277 --> 16:29.478
and I'm right there.
I just need you to care. Please.

16:29.512 --> 16:32.513
I do care, Drama, that's why
I'm still standing here.

16:32.548 --> 16:34.582
- You do not need a team.
- A greenlit show

16:34.616 --> 16:36.717
with me as the lead,
it'll change my life.

16:36.751 --> 16:39.019
Why doesn't he have
a greenlit show, Lloyd?

16:39.053 --> 16:40.987
The network hasn't found
a script they like yet.

16:41.021 --> 16:43.722
They haven't found a script they like or they
haven't found a script they like for him?

16:43.757 --> 16:45.924
<i>- Well...
- Drama: What does that mean?</i>

16:48.060 --> 16:51.228
It means they're still making shows, right?
They're not out of business.

16:51.263 --> 16:54.331
- So are you giving it to him straight?
- Giving me what straight?

16:57.501 --> 16:59.635
Maybe they don't want to
make a show with you, Drama.

16:59.669 --> 17:01.369
They gave me a holding deal.

17:01.404 --> 17:04.872
The guy who grills my hot dog at
Carney's had a holding deal in 1978.

17:04.906 --> 17:07.643
Phil says we just need a script.
You think he's lying?

17:07.676 --> 17:10.445
I don't know who Phil is,
but I think he might be, yeah.

17:11.915 --> 17:15.282
- Lloyd, what's the truth?
- Don't go crazy, Johnny.

17:15.317 --> 17:18.017
- What?
- They're making "The fall guy. "

17:19.553 --> 17:22.355
You're kidding me.
Phil told me they weren't making that show.

17:22.390 --> 17:24.391
I'm so sorry, Drama,
but they are.

17:24.425 --> 17:27.193
- Just maybe not with you.
- With who then?

17:27.228 --> 17:29.395
Dean Cain.

17:30.297 --> 17:32.865
Dean Cain, Jesus Christ.

17:32.900 --> 17:36.202
Look, just let the deal run out, all right?
Something will come along.

17:36.236 --> 17:39.806
- Don't worry out it.
- I want my own show, Ari. They promised me that.

17:39.840 --> 17:43.075
I don't think even I can
make that happen, Drama.

17:44.311 --> 17:46.279
I'm sorry.

17:50.549 --> 17:53.283
Wow. I mean, you really
think Ari told the studio?

17:53.317 --> 17:57.052
- Fucking piece of shit.
- I just can't believe he'd go against both of us.

17:57.087 --> 17:59.821
What a shock, huh?
It looks good, Mikey. Thank you.

17:59.856 --> 18:02.590
Well, I guess we'll
go back to using a double.

18:02.625 --> 18:05.560
Vince, you're a big boy.
You want to do the stunt, you do it.

18:05.594 --> 18:07.428
- You got all the power.
- I don't know.

18:07.463 --> 18:10.097
Come on, the studio wants you
for three movies right now.

18:10.132 --> 18:12.533
You do what you want.
You just gotta put your foot down.

18:12.568 --> 18:15.870
- Yeah, except...
- When Sean Penn wanted to do "She's so lovely" with me,

18:15.904 --> 18:18.405
he wanted to jump through
a plate-glass fucking window.

18:18.440 --> 18:20.941
Not with fucking fake glass.
Real fucking glass.

18:20.975 --> 18:22.743
You think the studio
wanted him to do it?

18:22.777 --> 18:25.178
You think the insurance
companies weren't going crazy?

18:25.213 --> 18:27.348
Sean basically had to quit
the film to get what he wanted.

18:27.382 --> 18:29.216
- And you know what?
- He did it?

18:29.250 --> 18:31.451
He did it.
Goddamn right.

18:31.485 --> 18:33.620
Sean's no bitch.

18:33.654 --> 18:37.991
- Does anything look vaguely familiar?
- Mmm, not really.

18:38.025 --> 18:40.559
- How far did you walk to get to the stairs?
- I took the elevator.

18:40.593 --> 18:42.426
- How many floors down?
- I don't remember!

18:42.460 --> 18:44.660
- Stop grilling me.
- Turtle, give her a break.

18:44.694 --> 18:46.860
I don't understand
how anyone could lose a car.

18:46.895 --> 18:49.394
I'm sorry, Turtle.
It's not like I'm an idiot.

18:49.428 --> 18:52.430
- I just have a ton on my mind.
- Turtle: Don't cry.

18:52.464 --> 18:54.565
- Well, you're yelling at me.
- I'm not yelling.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.300
<i>Stop stop stop, there it is.
There it is.</i>

18:56.334 --> 18:58.934
- All right, you're going to Santa Monica, okay?
- Yes, sir.

19:02.670 --> 19:06.372
- I'm really sorry.
- For the third time today, Alex.

19:06.407 --> 19:09.743
It's just my parents
are getting divorced, okay?

19:09.777 --> 19:12.779
Oh, I'm really sorry.

19:12.813 --> 19:15.181
No, no, I'm sorry.

19:15.215 --> 19:18.383
It's not an excuse,
but I've been distracted.

19:18.417 --> 19:20.551
And I haven't told
anyone till you,

19:20.585 --> 19:23.352
because honestly, I still
can't even believe it.

19:23.387 --> 19:26.188
I mean, I know divorce
is common and all,

19:26.222 --> 19:28.522
but my father was like
the perfect dad, you know?

19:28.557 --> 19:30.591
Only it
turns out that he wasn't.

19:30.625 --> 19:31.725
Hey, come on, don't cry.

19:31.760 --> 19:33.827
Come on, don't cry.
Come here.

19:34.729 --> 19:36.729
It's gonna be okay.

19:39.433 --> 19:41.700
All right?

19:44.904 --> 19:46.838
- What the hell are you doing?
- Nothing.

19:46.873 --> 19:49.740
I don't know.
I just thought we had a moment.

19:49.774 --> 19:51.608
What moment?
I tell you my parents

19:51.642 --> 19:53.610
are getting divorced
and you try to kiss me.

19:53.644 --> 19:56.979
Yes, I'm really sorry.
I totally misread the situation.

19:57.013 --> 19:59.681
- I thought we had a vibe.
- Let's just stop.

19:59.716 --> 20:01.750
Let's just get out of here.

20:10.324 --> 20:13.692
I, um, I think I shouldn't
work for you anymore.

20:13.727 --> 20:16.061
Come on, Alex,
don't quit because of me.

20:16.095 --> 20:18.863
It's a really good job and
you're really good at it.

20:18.898 --> 20:20.965
I'm not really.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.868
I know you wish you could
have fired me lots of times.

20:23.902 --> 20:25.702
But now I know why you didn't.

20:25.736 --> 20:27.970
- It's not like that.
- Oh no?

20:28.005 --> 20:30.039
What is it like?

20:35.211 --> 20:37.312
Take it easy, John.

20:37.346 --> 20:39.447
Why didn't you just tell me they
didn't want to make a show with me?

20:39.481 --> 20:42.283
- Because they do want to make a show with you.
- I mean, Jesus Christ.

20:42.317 --> 20:44.218
They gave me a deal,
a couple bucks

20:44.252 --> 20:45.919
to keep me off the market
and then nothing.

20:45.953 --> 20:47.887
This is all because they're
making "The fall guy"?

20:47.921 --> 20:50.122
<i>- You told me they weren't making it.
- No, I did not.</i>

20:50.156 --> 20:52.824
- I said it wasn't happening with you.
- Why not?

20:52.858 --> 20:54.625
They want someone...

20:54.660 --> 20:56.360
Prettier.

20:56.394 --> 20:58.829
Dean Cain is prettier than me?

21:01.432 --> 21:02.732
Hello?

21:02.766 --> 21:04.901
You're specific, John,
and that's a good thing.

21:04.935 --> 21:07.236
It means when we find the right
thing, it'll be special.

21:07.270 --> 21:09.838
<i>- And it will pop.
- My team doesn't think so.</i>

21:09.872 --> 21:12.607
My team doesn't think the network's
ever going to make a show with me.

21:12.641 --> 21:16.043
They're fucking agents, John!
They don't believe in extra work.

21:16.078 --> 21:20.080
You just keep pushing.
You just keep believing in yourself.

21:20.115 --> 21:21.748
I do.

21:25.152 --> 21:26.752
Fucking Ari.

21:26.787 --> 21:28.721
It doesn't matter if Sean Penn
does his own stunts, Vince.

21:28.755 --> 21:30.189
It doesn't mean
that you should.

21:30.223 --> 21:31.757
Tom Cruise in
"Knight and day" also.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.925
I've wasted too much of
my day on this already.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.727
First you want out,
then you want in.

21:35.761 --> 21:38.495
Which is it? I got dinner with the wife.
She's gonna cut my balls off.

21:38.529 --> 21:40.596
I hate Ari, bro!

21:43.465 --> 21:45.065
Oh hey, Ari.

21:45.100 --> 21:46.967
Hey, dickhead.
What's the beef?

21:47.001 --> 21:48.768
No beef.

21:48.802 --> 21:51.973
I just wish you would put as much effort
into my career as you do your own.

21:52.007 --> 21:53.975
That sounds reasonable.

21:54.009 --> 21:55.576
<i>- Be nice, Ari.
- I will be.</i>

21:55.610 --> 21:57.510
But right now I'm worried
about you.

21:57.545 --> 21:59.278
Why, what's wrong with Vince?
You all right?

21:59.312 --> 22:01.947
- He's thinking about doing the stunt.
- Come on.

22:01.981 --> 22:05.216
- What?!
- Nothing. I just don't see it.

22:05.250 --> 22:07.383
You know Will Smith did all
his own stunts on "Hancock"?

22:07.418 --> 22:09.385
Will's an athlete, bro.
I bowled with him.

22:09.419 --> 22:12.120
Jesus Christ, what are we doing?
I got dinner.

22:12.154 --> 22:13.221
<i>- Yo.
Yo.</i>

22:13.255 --> 22:14.855
Yo, did you fire
that broad yet?

22:14.889 --> 22:17.556
- No, actually she quit.
- Really?

22:17.590 --> 22:19.424
Impressive.
How'd you pull that off?

22:19.459 --> 22:22.226
- It doesn't matter. I don't want to talk about it.
- Awww, he's sad.

22:22.260 --> 22:25.095
- He totally likes her.
- Who gives a shit?

22:25.129 --> 22:27.530
- Vinnie, what are we doing?
- Turtle,

22:27.564 --> 22:29.898
I think I'm going
to do the stunt myself.

22:31.533 --> 22:33.466
- Come on.
- Wow.

22:33.501 --> 22:35.668
You all think I'm such a pussy.

22:35.703 --> 22:40.039
All right, I'm gonna call the
studio and tell them I'm doing it.

22:40.074 --> 22:42.176
Vince, you're gonna do
the stunt for what?

22:42.210 --> 22:43.612
So these guys don't
think you're a pussy?

22:43.647 --> 22:45.816
No, I'm gonna do it
so I stop feeling like one.

22:52.958 --> 22:54.858
- Full loads?
- Yeah.

22:54.893 --> 22:56.828
Good.
Good good.

22:56.862 --> 23:00.700
This is not a rehearsal!
We got one shot at this.

23:00.735 --> 23:04.003
- I'm sorry, baby.
- I changed this to today for you.

23:04.038 --> 23:05.672
- I'm gonna make it up to you.
- How?!

23:05.706 --> 23:07.441
<i>I'm gonna take you away
for the weekend.</i>

23:07.475 --> 23:09.408
<i>I'll get a plane.
We'll go to Cabo.</i>

23:09.443 --> 23:12.410
We'll stay at Meldman's.
I'm gonna get you a nice lobster from Edith's.

23:12.444 --> 23:14.145
<i>- Really?
- No, not really.</i>

23:14.179 --> 23:17.080
<i>I got the company retreat this weekend.
I totally forgot.</i>

23:17.114 --> 23:19.182
Hello?
Hello?

23:19.216 --> 23:21.618
You all right?
- My hand's shaking a little,

23:21.652 --> 23:24.254
but I'll be okay.
What's the worst that could happen?

23:24.289 --> 23:26.456
Vic Morrow got his head
chopped off by a helicopter.

23:26.491 --> 23:28.692
- Brandon Lee got shot with squibs.
Idiots.

23:28.726 --> 23:30.460
<i>- Good talk.
- Nick: You nervous?</i>

23:30.495 --> 23:31.728
No.

23:31.763 --> 23:33.297
Well, a little.

23:33.331 --> 23:35.866
All right. I'm operating the
camera, so we're in this together.

23:35.901 --> 23:38.836
- What do you mean?
- I'm gonna be in there with you, brother.

23:39.771 --> 23:41.872
Not too late to call it off.

23:41.906 --> 23:44.373
Are you kidding me?
That'd be humiliating.

23:44.408 --> 23:47.509
The guy's got "Extra" and "Entertainment
tonight" here just to see this.

23:47.543 --> 23:49.677
- And he's doing the stunt with me.
- Relly?

23:49.711 --> 23:51.912
Yeah, it'll be fine.

23:53.581 --> 23:55.782
"E. T."'s here?

23:55.816 --> 23:57.951
Hey, scumbag, you see
the trades today?

23:57.985 --> 24:00.386
<i>- Ari: Not yet.
- Check toward the back.</i>

24:00.421 --> 24:02.922
You guys should check it out.
It concerns you too.

24:07.160 --> 24:09.994
Where'd you get that?

24:10.028 --> 24:11.962
Google images.
Payback's a bitch, Ari.

24:11.997 --> 24:14.899
Back when you were on the sauce,
you would have tried to fuck it!

24:14.933 --> 24:17.201
<i>- You ready?
- Yeah, we're ready.</i>

24:17.235 --> 24:19.036
- What do we got?
- Vehicle's ready.

24:19.070 --> 24:20.637
Vincent's got it down cold.

24:20.672 --> 24:23.540
All we gotta do is get you in,
get a camera on you,

24:23.574 --> 24:25.809
roll it, take a shot at it.

24:25.843 --> 24:28.245
- Piece of cake, right?
- Yep.

24:29.681 --> 24:31.748
Let us pray.

24:33.950 --> 24:36.950
Remember, Vince, the worst thing
you could do is hesitate.

24:36.984 --> 24:39.548
- Get on this bad boy and go.
- Got it.

24:39.582 --> 24:42.149
The accelerator is your friend.
Trust your steering.

24:42.183 --> 24:44.917
- As soon as you land the jump...
- cut to the right and brake.

24:44.952 --> 24:47.753
That's right. I'll be
communicating with you by walkie.

24:47.788 --> 24:49.621
All right.

24:49.656 --> 24:51.723
- I'm ready.
- Nick, you okay?

24:51.758 --> 24:53.258
- Let's do it.
- Ready!

24:54.827 --> 24:57.262
- Do this!
- Okay, action!

24:57.296 --> 25:00.198
<i>Camera.</i>

25:05.837 --> 25:08.739
<i>Vince: It won't brake.
It won't brake!</i>

25:08.773 --> 25:10.207
All: Oh shit!

25:10.241 --> 25:12.575
<i>Get that fire out!</i>

25:12.610 --> 25:14.677
<i>Fire team 2, go go go!</i>

25:14.712 --> 25:17.045
<i>Hey, guys, get in there!</i>

25:20.581 --> 25:23.048
Hold on.
Just let them put out the fire.

25:23.083 --> 25:25.818
<i>Just hold on, guys. Just wait a second.
Let them do their jobs.</i>

25:25.852 --> 25:28.253
Turtle:
Okay okay.

25:33.325 --> 25:35.226
- All right, he's out.
- Oh God.

25:36.894 --> 25:38.762
- You okay, bro?
- Yeah.

25:38.796 --> 25:40.963
I don't know, I...
I think so.

25:40.998 --> 25:42.698
- Does anything hurt?
- No.

25:42.733 --> 25:44.667
Ari: I saw my life
flash before my eyes.

25:44.702 --> 25:47.270
I didn't. I just saw ma.
She was really pissed.

25:48.172 --> 25:49.805
- You all right...
- Guys!

25:49.839 --> 25:52.507
- I think I'm okay.
- Drama: You could have internal bleeding.

25:52.542 --> 25:54.209
He actually looks okay.
His vitals are fine.

25:54.243 --> 25:56.911
I'm actually okay too,
if anybody gives a shit.

25:56.945 --> 25:59.147
<i>- I don't give a shit.
- Vince: Nick!</i>

25:59.181 --> 26:01.315
I'm sorry. I screwed it up.

26:01.349 --> 26:03.417
You all right?

26:03.451 --> 26:05.819
I gotta tell you,
that shit looked sick.

26:06.854 --> 26:08.654
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

26:12.525 --> 26:15.126
'Cause if you're not sure,
I'm ready to go again.

26:16.228 --> 26:17.995
Seriously.
