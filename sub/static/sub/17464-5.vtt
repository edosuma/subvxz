says regarding the store,

- I'm still going up to see Daniel.
- I'd like to go with you.

00:21.390 --> 00:23.029
Do you think I should just do it?

00:23.030 --> 00:24.898

- Leave.

Would you mind not attending
to your personal...

01:16.589 --> 01:17.832
Oh.

01:17.833 --> 01:19.014
I'm sorry, Dan.

01:19.967 --> 01:21.937
Thought you were already asleep.

01:23.470 --> 01:26.508
O-Or if I am a-asleep.

not do that in my presence.

I-I'm not trying to
start anything, Manny.

01:57.656 --> 01:59.664

02:01.658 --> 02:04.054
It's just not appropriate, you know?

02:05.175 --> 02:07.155

02:42.419 --> 02:45.234
I found this in the attic...
Daniel's old stuff.

02:45.235 --> 02:47.465
Thought maybe you might like
some of it in Nashville.

02:47.466 --> 02:50.502
You know, since he's not
coming back here ever.

02:50.503 --> 02:52.238
That is so thoughtful of you, Jared,

02:52.239 --> 02:54.874
but I don't think Daniel really
wants these things anymore.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.029
How do you know?

02:56.732 --> 03:01.847
Well, Daniel actually threw
all of that stuff away.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.281
A while back.

03:03.282 --> 03:04.818
Threw it away? Then how did it...

03:07.186 --> 03:08.954
Did you pull all of his
things out of the trash

03:08.955 --> 03:10.049
after he put them there?

03:10.967 --> 03:12.323
Well, yes.

03:13.025 --> 03:14.100
Yes, I did.

03:15.253 --> 03:16.470
That's weird, Mom.

03:16.930 --> 03:17.949
Isn't that weird?

03:19.332 --> 03:21.066
I'm not getting involved.

03:22.858 --> 03:25.637
He was a little... unstable at the time,

03:25.638 --> 03:28.139
and I was afraid he might
regret his decision.

03:28.140 --> 03:29.509
Did he?

03:31.578 --> 03:33.948
Maybe I'll broach it when I'm there.

04:32.538 --> 04:34.507
It's a lot, all right.

04:34.508 --> 04:37.175
I mean, Mr. Childers said it.

04:37.176 --> 04:40.078
We could relocate 'cross town somewhere

04:40.079 --> 04:41.761
and be able to bank what's left over.

04:41.762 --> 04:43.382
He did say that.

04:43.383 --> 04:44.886
That's not true?

04:46.826 --> 04:48.487
Theoretically, we could relocate

04:48.488 --> 04:50.022
if we found a building suitable

04:50.023 --> 04:51.762
that actually had people driving by it.

04:51.763 --> 04:53.459
Look, they just want what we got,

04:53.460 --> 04:54.560
and they want to make their offer

04:54.561 --> 04:55.827
as tempting as all get-out.

04:56.141 --> 04:57.877
Mission accomplished.

05:00.525 --> 05:02.892
But there's nothing about the offer

05:02.893 --> 05:05.829
that says we have to open up
again in Paulie, does it?

05:05.830 --> 05:08.416
There's nothing in the contract,
if that's what you mean.

05:19.001 --> 05:20.301
Or where?

05:20.302 --> 05:21.403
I have no idea.

05:21.404 --> 05:22.870
I just think it's kind of nice

05:22.871 --> 05:24.907
to consider what doesn't have to be.

05:27.075 --> 05:30.245
I mean, do we even want to run

05:30.246 --> 05:32.079
Do you?

05:32.080 --> 05:35.716
Did you ever want to run a tire
store in the first place, Ted?

05:35.717 --> 05:38.450
Why does it matter if I ever wanted to?

05:39.821 --> 05:41.161
Because I don't know.

05:42.642 --> 05:44.910
And I've always been afraid to ask.

05:46.413 --> 05:49.236

honest, the answer is...

05:50.815 --> 05:52.105
probably not.

06:10.018 --> 06:12.091
if I'm being totally honest?

06:13.684 --> 06:15.356
Sure. Always.

06:16.451 --> 06:18.294
I think we should sell.

06:20.862 --> 06:22.398

06:35.049 --> 06:36.487
Okay.

06:37.663 --> 06:39.848
What if my response was...

06:39.849 --> 06:41.183
"I don't want to sell.

06:41.184 --> 06:43.562
I don't want to sell the
damn store, Janet."

06:43.563 --> 06:44.824

what would you do?"
