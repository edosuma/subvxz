00:08.642 --> 00:10.444
Someone had
a good night.

00:10.478 --> 00:13.147
Do you think
all of these people
have had sex?

00:13.181 --> 00:15.049
And if so,
shouldn't they
be more happy?

00:15.083 --> 00:16.817
Maybe their experiences

00:16.850 --> 00:18.819
weren't as recent
as yours.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.488
I think about sex
with everyone.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.923
But mostly with Carly.

00:22.956 --> 00:25.226
She and I
are very compatible.

00:25.259 --> 00:27.528
That's great, Shaun,
but H.R. might not approve.

00:27.561 --> 00:29.163
About me
thinking of sex?

00:29.197 --> 00:31.699
No, about saying you're
thinking about sex.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.634
(CHUCKLES)
And stop it.

00:33.667 --> 00:36.470
Smiling while talking
to a dying man is not cool.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.339
Dr. Blaize recommended
we speak to you

00:38.372 --> 00:39.473
about a permanent port.

00:39.507 --> 00:41.875
It would simplify
your chemo sessions.

00:41.909 --> 00:43.844
No more hunting
for a vein every time.

00:46.847 --> 00:48.682
Anything to help
with the nausea?

00:49.583 --> 00:51.051
It's a normal
side effect.

00:53.687 --> 00:56.557
Anything you can do
for the exhaustion?

00:58.726 --> 00:59.827
Anything...

01:00.861 --> 01:02.763
So that my muscles
don't ache?

01:09.103 --> 01:11.839
But you can keep me
from being stuck
by a needle.

01:14.142 --> 01:15.209
They're just trying
to help.

01:15.243 --> 01:16.344

All the doctors
are trying to help.

01:24.652 --> 01:25.786
I'm sorry.

01:26.554 --> 01:27.555
Thank you.

01:29.022 --> 01:30.624
But I-I don't need the port.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.467
And I don't need
any more chemo.

01:41.335 --> 01:42.903
Of course you do.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.672
It's going to give you
more time.

You have clusters of them.

gave me a year.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.963
Mass General, two years.

02:09.997 --> 02:11.999
So, what, you figured
I'd give you three?

02:12.800 --> 02:14.635
Some new treatment?

02:14.668 --> 02:17.037
You know the treatment,
Caroline... A lobectomy.

02:17.070 --> 02:19.673
I love the way surgeons
blithely suggest

02:19.707 --> 02:21.409
cutting through
my cerebral cortex

02:21.442 --> 02:23.344
to remove part of my brain.
Hmm.

02:23.377 --> 02:26.814
Why not just
take an egg slicer
to my ability to paint?

02:26.847 --> 02:30.351
Yes, it will likely lead
to a curtailment

02:30.384 --> 02:32.353
of your ability
to be creative,

02:32.386 --> 02:35.356

your other faculties
will remain intact.

Surgery, chemo,

02:52.005 --> 02:55.676
My greatest fear
wasn't at the edges
of the spectrum.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.010
It wasn't life or death.

02:57.044 --> 02:58.479
My greatest fear

02:58.512 --> 03:00.448
was survival
as something lesser.

03:00.481 --> 03:01.682
Then you know.

03:01.715 --> 03:03.717
And then I had
a revelation of sorts.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.519
Who I am,
how I think of myself

03:05.553 --> 03:08.656
isn't defined by
my skill as a surgeon.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.292
Uh, I'm seeing
you as a courtesy.

03:11.325 --> 03:12.493
I don't do this anymore.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.362
And guess what?
I'm fine.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.231
I'm happier.

30 more years

at dawn and dusk.

not to wake you.

12:13.533 --> 12:14.567
Appreciate it.

12:14.601 --> 12:15.735
I've brought you

12:15.769 --> 12:17.971
a jelly doughnut
and coffee...
Thank you.

12:18.005 --> 12:19.840
...to celebrate
last night's breakthrough.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.274
What breakthrough
was that?

12:23.210 --> 12:24.211
Last night.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.615
You had a parade.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.886
During lunch.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.755
You made a lot of noise.

12:35.789 --> 12:37.825
One fairly loud noise...
A moan.

12:38.525 --> 12:39.759
Oh.

Right, right.

12:44.397 --> 12:46.099
You had your elbow
on my hair.

last night,

12:53.406 --> 12:55.042

a medical glitch.

13:18.431 --> 13:20.400

Your sister's here. Bye.

You're in time

I didn't know where
you were staying,

13:24.838 --> 13:27.374
if you'd left town,
if you'd gone home.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.642
I finally got your
new housekeeper
on the phone

13:29.676 --> 13:31.111
and convinced her
I was your daughter.

that you're dying?

13:44.291 --> 13:45.825
No.

I'm having
a good arthritis day.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.396
Why shouldn't
I feel happy?

inherit anything from me.

13:57.204 --> 13:59.472
I thought Mom ditched
the medical police.

13:59.506 --> 14:02.709
Right, the bad guys trying
to keep her alive.

14:02.742 --> 14:04.277
We've all tried to get her
to change her mind,

what she's like.

trying to figure out a way
to convince Mom...

14:14.654 --> 14:16.823
Did it occur to either of you
to mention any of this

14:16.856 --> 14:18.858
to the only doctor
in the family?

14:18.892 --> 14:20.460
Plenty of doctors
already involved.

14:21.661 --> 14:23.796
And you barely
consider yourself
part of this family.

You exclude me,

your parents were

Something else?

She loves Outlander.

What if this wasn't caused
by the Cav Mals?

16:11.371 --> 16:13.006
First the bleeding,
then the seizure...

16:13.040 --> 16:14.241
Pretty typical progression.

16:14.274 --> 16:18.278
It's also possible
the bleeding
caused the seizure.

16:20.347 --> 16:24.351
Microbleeds can cause gliosis,
and that can cause a seizure.

16:24.384 --> 16:26.319
And if the seizure
was caused by gliosis,

Dr. Glassman,

are you sure
of this location?

The recent infections

your immune system

an aggressive cancer.

36:43.669 --> 36:45.036
What makes
a cancer aggressive

36:45.070 --> 36:47.873
is its ability to evade
the immune system.
