12:54.440 --> 12:57.409
Although I don't really fit
into much these days,

12:57.510 --> 12:59.535
what with the baby on the way.

12:59.678 --> 13:01.441
You're pregnant?

13:02.081 --> 13:03.480
You just thought I got fat?

13:03.582 --> 13:05.846
No.

13:05.951 --> 13:07.418
Okay, yeah.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.784
But I didn't want to say anything.

13:09.889 --> 13:11.379
We're due in the winter.

13:11.490 --> 13:14.288
Oh, Marnie, I'm so happy for you.
That is so great.

[Cell phone rings]

13:17.663 --> 13:19.324
I got to go. I got...

13:19.431 --> 13:20.762
I'm so sorry. It's Scott.

13:20.866 --> 13:23.096
Wow. The rumors are true.

13:23.202 --> 13:24.965
You two finally got together.

13:25.070 --> 13:29.006
Yeah, I'II...
I'll get back to you on that.

[Cows low]

13:38.751 --> 13:40.742
Get them in the water.
Here we go.

13:58.270 --> 14:02.070
Ah, you know, I think this could be
just a bit above my skill level.

14:02.174 --> 14:04.506
No, the water's only gonna
come up to his knees.

14:04.610 --> 14:05.542
You'll be fine.

14:05.644 --> 14:08.477
No. I've been behind a desk
for years in Calgary.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.242
Why don't I just walk him across?

14:10.349 --> 14:12.283
Why don't you
just give me your leg?

14:12.384 --> 14:14.079
Excuse me?

14:14.186 --> 14:15.551
Your leg.

My leg?

14:16.989 --> 14:19.583
- Give me your leg.
- Okay.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.216
- Put it in my stirrup.
- Yeah.

14:21.327 --> 14:22.919
- Give me your hand.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:23.028 --> 14:24.461
And up.

14:24.563 --> 14:25.552
Ah! Woo!

14:25.664 --> 14:27.825
- There you go.
- Okay.

14:27.933 --> 14:28.957
Just like that.

14:29.101 --> 14:30.329
- Ah!
- Hang on tight.

14:30.436 --> 14:32.063
Something tells me
you've done this before.

14:32.171 --> 14:32.967
Once or twice.

14:39.745 --> 14:42.680
- Hang on tight.
- Okay.

Your dad's a legend on the circuit.

on your horse?

14:59.698 --> 15:02.667
Man, this cattle-drive thing
was just getting good.

15:03.836 --> 15:05.326
Be careful.

Hey, your friend back there...

15:19.251 --> 15:22.345
You just never know
when to quit, do you?

Whoa, whoa whoa, easy.

15:37.069 --> 15:38.798
What, is she afraid of water?

15:38.904 --> 15:41.930
No, it's more like she doesn't know
which way is which.

15:42.041 --> 15:44.874
Come on, girl. Let's go.

15:45.411 --> 15:47.003
Seems okay now.

Yeah, it's all good.

16:01.427 --> 16:02.621
How was she on the trail?

16:02.728 --> 16:03.660
Pretty clumsy.

Figured I was
doing something wrong.

Tell that to my osteopath.

16:47.172 --> 16:48.161
Oh, please.

16:48.307 --> 16:50.571
You've been carping
about that neck of yours for years.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.837
Well, at least I can turn my head.

16:52.945 --> 16:54.173
Which is more
than I can say for you.

16:54.279 --> 16:56.076
Maybe next time you should watch
where you're going.

you don't want to take a break?

gonna miss all this.

Now, you make that sound tempting.

I was fielding offers.

Not really much of a story.

20:54.519 --> 20:55.952
Yeah, bending over backwards

20:56.054 --> 20:58.249
is what the hospitality industry
is all about.

the whole weekend

would never happen in Toronto.

to make this easy, Amy.

This is crazy.
We have to get rid of them, Lou.

23:09.087 --> 23:11.851
I tried to get rid of them, Scott,
but they're bloggers.

23:11.957 --> 23:15.120
A bad rep in the blogosphere
could be a death sentence.

23:15.293 --> 23:16.885
Yeah, well, they're drinking
my champagne.

23:16.995 --> 23:18.223
That is the least of my worries.

23:18.330 --> 23:19.194
What am I gonna do

23:19.297 --> 23:21.288
when they're finished
drinking your champagne?

23:21.400 --> 23:23.300

I have nothing to feed them.

And as for the authentic
Western experience,

23:26.805 --> 23:27.703
what am I gonna do?

23:27.806 --> 23:29.330
Have them muck out the barn?

23:38.049 --> 23:39.346
- That's right.
- Remember that?

23:39.451 --> 23:41.646
I remember that. That is.

23:42.721 --> 23:45.451
Who's up for some branding
and castrating?

23:46.558 --> 23:48.116
That might be
almost too authentic.

23:48.293 --> 23:50.420
But we're willing to try anything.

No. But we both love seafood.

You've got to help me.

What's the problem?

24:11.850 --> 24:13.181
Well, there's gonna be music.

24:13.285 --> 24:16.812
And once the music starts,
Jake's gonna ask me to dance.

24:19.958 --> 24:23.394
So you're gonna avoid the issue
instead of telling him the truth?

24:23.495 --> 24:25.122
Worked for you.

24:28.333 --> 24:33.293
I mean, why haven't you told Amy
the truth why you really left?

24:33.405 --> 24:34.531
It's complicated.

24:34.639 --> 24:36.436
Of course, another huge
complicated issue

24:36.541 --> 24:38.099
that no one can possibly
ever talk about.

24:38.210 --> 24:40.508
Okay. Maybe I didn't handle things
as well as I could have.

24:40.612 --> 24:44.412
Well, you have the rest of your life
to deal with that, right?

25:08.540 --> 25:10.667
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, not so much next week.

25:10.775 --> 25:13.005
More like right now.

25:13.111 --> 25:14.635
Listen, I don't care what you make.

25:14.746 --> 25:16.441
But if it could be
authentic Western cuisine,

25:16.548 --> 25:18.846
that would be a huge bonus.

25:18.950 --> 25:20.884
Mmm-hmm.

25:23.054 --> 25:26.717
Hey, I hear you got yourself
a blind horse.

25:26.825 --> 25:27.985
Yeah.

25:28.093 --> 25:29.651
Figured it out
when Ty had some trouble

25:29.761 --> 25:31.023
getting across the river.

25:32.697 --> 25:34.187
Sort of like your friend.

25:34.332 --> 25:36.163
Oh, Ray's daughter?

25:36.268 --> 25:38.168
Callie?

25:38.670 --> 25:40.228
She fired me.

25:40.338 --> 25:42.101
Really?

25:42.207 --> 25:43.970
Hm. You were let go.

25:44.075 --> 25:48.535
See, from where I was, it looked like
she was holding on pretty tight.

25:49.981 --> 25:51.573
Yeah.

25:51.683 --> 25:55.813
Honey, you know,
we've never really talked about...

25:57.289 --> 26:01.692
It's been a... Like, for me...

26:02.193 --> 26:03.558
I just... I like her.

26:04.729 --> 26:06.287
Even though she fired you?

26:06.498 --> 26:08.966
Well, especially 'cause she fired me.

26:09.067 --> 26:14.027
I mean, the last person you want
to go dating is your boss, right?

26:14.506 --> 26:17.373
I guess.

26:18.009 --> 26:20.477
What, you came here
to ask me if it's okay?

26:22.147 --> 26:23.705
Well, it's as new to me
as it is to you,

26:23.815 --> 26:24.804
and I just met the woman.

26:24.916 --> 26:28.443
So, I don't think we need
to get all worked up about it.

26:31.623 --> 26:33.488
Would it be okay?

26:34.259 --> 26:36.591
[Laughs]

26:38.563 --> 26:39.552
Whatever.

26:40.966 --> 26:45.198
This is already way too much
information for me.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.603
Well, that was certainly
an eye-opener.

26:51.710 --> 26:53.268
Oh, hey. Thanks to Scott,

26:53.378 --> 26:56.279
we know that prairie oysters
ain't from the sea.

26:56.381 --> 26:57.507
That's great.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.447
How 'bout you guys take
a breather over by the fire?

26:59.551 --> 27:00.916
And dinner will be ready
any minute.

27:01.019 --> 27:01.508
Okay.

27:02.087 --> 27:03.645
Dinner?
What are you talking about?

27:03.755 --> 27:05.552
Just make them a sandwich
and send them to bed.

27:05.657 --> 27:06.988
Where do you want me
to set up, Lou?

27:07.092 --> 27:08.821
Oh, just right there.

27:08.927 --> 27:10.019
What are you waiting for, Scott?

27:10.128 --> 27:11.686
There's hors d'oeuvres
rotting in the truck.

27:11.863 --> 27:14.798
And that mud pie's
not gonna walk here on its own.

27:29.614 --> 27:32.048
Listen.
I'm sorry, but we need to talk.

27:32.217 --> 27:33.616
I need to talk.

27:33.718 --> 27:35.652
There's problems.
A million problems.

27:35.754 --> 27:37.984
Like I'm Aries.
You're Pisces.

27:38.823 --> 27:41.348
You're not a big talker.
I'm a talkaholic.

27:41.526 --> 27:44.290
You're a little bit country.
I'm a little bit rock 'r roll.

27:46.531 --> 27:47.520
You're too short.

27:48.299 --> 27:50.426
I'll grow.

27:53.905 --> 27:54.837
Want to dance?

27:54.939 --> 27:57.499
After you.

27:59.144 --> 28:01.942
Well, I got to say,
I'm surprised you're still here,

28:02.047 --> 28:05.016
given your opinion
on ranching and cowboys.

28:05.116 --> 28:08.347
I said I wasrt interested in cows.
I didn't say anything about cowboys.

28:08.453 --> 28:09.977
Well, what about
unemployed cowboys?

28:10.088 --> 28:11.578
It's not a problem.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.624
So, you're about to make a killing
in real estate.

28:13.725 --> 28:15.659
Arert you worried that one
of those unemployed cowboys

28:15.760 --> 28:16.954
might take advantage of you?

28:17.062 --> 28:19.087
That's exactly what I was hoping for.

28:21.566 --> 28:23.158
Um...

28:23.268 --> 28:28.399
Well, then, I guess the next thing
I should do is ask you to dance.

28:28.506 --> 28:30.906
But my daughter's over there,
and she's got issues.

28:32.343 --> 28:34.208
Okay, I've never danced
in a trailer before,

28:34.312 --> 28:35.301
but I'll give it a whirl.

28:50.929 --> 28:52.260
You want to turn in early?

28:52.363 --> 28:56.299
What are you getting at, Lisa?
You think I can't stay up past 9:00?

28:56.401 --> 28:58.164
No. I didn't say that.

28:58.269 --> 28:59.031
Well, maybe not.

28:59.137 --> 29:01.867
But you have been treating me
like a relic of the Old West

29:01.973 --> 29:04.066
ever since you bought me
that ridiculous saddle.

29:04.175 --> 29:06.735
Jack, that's what I do.

29:06.845 --> 29:09.177
I fuss. I worry.

29:09.314 --> 29:10.508
I buy inappropriate gifts.

29:10.615 --> 29:12.674
That's just what I do
with someone I love.

29:16.154 --> 29:17.451
Someone you...?

29:17.555 --> 29:19.284
Well, you're never gonna say it.

29:19.390 --> 29:21.187
But that's not gonna stop me.
I'm gonna tell you how I...

29:42.046 --> 29:44.310
- Mmm.
- Wow.

29:44.482 --> 29:46.040
Mmm.

29:47.318 --> 29:48.307
That was delicious.

29:49.354 --> 29:51.345
Best mud pie I've ever eaten.

29:51.456 --> 29:53.151
Can I offer you another slice?

29:53.258 --> 29:53.815
Well...

29:53.925 --> 29:56.291
Uh, we have a lot of blogging to do,
don't we, honey?

29:56.394 --> 29:58.362
High-speed? Out here?
You got to be kidding.

29:58.463 --> 30:00.658
That's what it said on the website.
Free Wi-Fi?

30:00.799 --> 30:03.768
I have dial-up in my office.

30:03.935 --> 30:05.368
See you guys at breakfast?

30:05.503 --> 30:07.403
Mmm, <i>huevos rancheros.</i>

30:07.505 --> 30:09.735
<i>Hasta la vista.</i>

30:16.281 --> 30:17.213
So, you two...

30:18.316 --> 30:20.045
Long-term relationship?

30:41.773 --> 30:43.934
Jack's got some pretty sweet moves.

30:46.544 --> 30:50.002
Yeah. That little slide thing he does
is cute.

30:51.850 --> 30:54.512
He's a pretty awesome guy.

30:54.619 --> 30:57.213
That night in Calgary,
he really saved my butt.

31:11.736 --> 31:15.672
Okay. You want to know
about my dad?

31:22.080 --> 31:25.675
For pretty much my whole life,
he's been in and out of prison.

31:25.783 --> 31:30.117
When I was a kid,
we used to go and visit him.

31:30.688 --> 31:33.452
He used to teach me
all this neat stuff.

31:37.695 --> 31:40.357
I thought he was a magician.

31:40.465 --> 31:44.868
He was pretty good
at making stuff disappear.

31:44.969 --> 31:48.302
Cards. Money.

31:48.473 --> 31:50.270
Himself...

31:50.375 --> 31:53.435
...when the money was gone.

31:53.578 --> 31:58.481
So, if you knew all this,
then why did you go see him?

31:59.484 --> 32:01.384
I don't know.

32:01.486 --> 32:03.420
I...

32:03.521 --> 32:04.715
Maybe it was because of you.

32:04.822 --> 32:06.756
Because of me?

32:06.891 --> 32:09.689
What you said
about second chances.

32:09.794 --> 32:12.319
There was a guy in Vancouver,
my dad said,

32:12.430 --> 32:15.661
that had offered him a job, and...

32:15.767 --> 32:18.031
I wanted to believe him.

32:18.136 --> 32:19.603
But there was no job.

32:19.737 --> 32:22.968
He used my money
to get into a hard-core poker game.

32:23.074 --> 32:26.669
So, then, why did you stick around?

32:26.778 --> 32:29.906
He's my dad, Amy.

32:31.683 --> 32:33.913
I couldn't just leave him there.
So, we came back to Calgary.

32:34.018 --> 32:36.077
- I got a job working construction.
- You were in Calgary?

32:36.187 --> 32:38.314
Ty, Calgary's an hour away.

32:38.489 --> 32:39.888
I know. I should have called you.

32:39.991 --> 32:43.290
I should have told you
what was going on, but...

32:46.264 --> 32:49.563
Amy, I didn't want to lie.

32:50.435 --> 32:54.838
There was only one thing
that I ever wanted to say to you.

32:56.007 --> 32:58.703
But I wasrt sure
you still wanted to hear it.

33:05.049 --> 33:07.415
I should go check on the cows.
It's my shift.

33:07.518 --> 33:08.246
Ty.

33:18.663 --> 33:21.131
[Laughs]

33:25.403 --> 33:26.734
I would love to stay
and talk some more,

33:26.838 --> 33:28.806
but I've really got to spend
some time with Jerry.

33:28.906 --> 33:30.168
With our crazy schedules,

33:30.274 --> 33:32.242
it's a miracle we even managed
to get pregnant.

33:32.343 --> 33:34.243
Well, it's about to get a lot crazier.

33:34.345 --> 33:36.711
Because next week
we actually open for business.

33:36.814 --> 33:40.011
Well, no worries.
I'll always be here for you.

33:40.118 --> 33:41.210
Thanks.

33:41.319 --> 33:43.685
All right. See you.

33:44.355 --> 33:47.085
Come here. Finally.

33:47.191 --> 33:49.682
I thought she'd never leave.

33:50.995 --> 33:52.826
What are you doing?

33:52.930 --> 33:54.921
Well, I guess I'll be going, too.

33:55.033 --> 33:58.002
What? We've been waiting all day
for this.

33:58.102 --> 34:00.036
Well, I got to get up pretty early.

34:00.138 --> 34:03.107
And to be honest,
I don't know what the point is.

34:03.207 --> 34:04.970
You don't, do you?

34:05.076 --> 34:07.271
I think you do.

34:07.378 --> 34:08.538
You know what I mean.

34:08.646 --> 34:11.614
Once you get your dude ranch going,
we might as well just call it in.

34:11.716 --> 34:13.684
That could be fun.

34:13.784 --> 34:15.116
I'm not joking, Lou.

34:17.288 --> 34:20.155
I'm always your second priority.
I always come second.

34:20.257 --> 34:21.782
That is not true.

34:22.793 --> 34:25.388
Two total strangers show up
and you just drop everything?

34:25.496 --> 34:26.895
What was I supposed to do?

34:26.998 --> 34:27.793
Kick them out.

34:27.899 --> 34:29.389
Yeah, my first clients?

34:29.534 --> 34:30.523
Lou, you don't get it.

34:30.635 --> 34:31.431
I didn't sign up to be

34:31.536 --> 34:34.130
the traditional native guide
for your hotel.

34:34.438 --> 34:37.567
Is that what this is about?
You know that was a one-time thing.

34:37.708 --> 34:39.300
Today was a one-time thing.

34:39.409 --> 34:40.900
How is that my fault?

34:41.045 --> 34:42.978
Our one chance
to spend some time together.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.379
You couldn't even take
a single lousy day off.

34:52.356 --> 34:53.618
I don't know about this, Lou.

34:53.724 --> 34:56.123
What don't you know about?

34:56.793 --> 34:58.853
I love you.

34:58.963 --> 35:01.523
But we got to do something,
or this is all gonna fall apart.

35:02.266 --> 35:05.497
I love you, too.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.970
Maybe we should take a break.

35:09.073 --> 35:11.871
Maybe we should get married.

35:13.611 --> 35:14.873
Married?

35:18.649 --> 35:20.674
[Cows low]

35:24.122 --> 35:26.056
You're late.
What have you been doing?

35:27.859 --> 35:29.349
Not much.

35:32.163 --> 35:34.757
You know, I think I'll go see
what Amy's doing,

35:35.066 --> 35:37.899
'cause I'm betting not much either.

35:38.002 --> 35:39.492
'Cause if it would have been me
back there with her...

35:39.670 --> 35:41.968
Hey, forget it, okay?

35:42.473 --> 35:44.407
Well, I wouldn't have left her
in the lurch

35:44.509 --> 35:46.136
to come water a bunch of cows.

35:46.711 --> 35:48.008
I'm warning you, man.

35:48.112 --> 35:52.378
And more than likely,
she'd be begging me to stay.

Stop!

Oh, my God!

36:46.804 --> 36:49.204
All right, all right, everybody.
Just keep it down.

36:49.307 --> 36:51.207
Keep it down.
Don't get them running.

36:51.309 --> 36:53.869
Let's push them back to the pen.
Nice and easy here.

why I hate ranching.

That's got to be pretty well it.

I don't get it.
How did the cows get out?

38:23.968 --> 38:27.699
Exactly what I was wondering.

38:27.805 --> 38:31.707
- It was the gate. It just swung open.
- One of the panels came loose.

38:34.445 --> 38:35.503
What happened to you?

38:35.613 --> 38:39.413
I got kicked by a cow.

38:39.517 --> 38:41.246
Oh.

38:41.352 --> 38:44.321
That same high-kicking cow
tear your shirt?

38:46.324 --> 38:48.189
No, it was one of them
damn longhorns.

38:48.626 --> 38:50.491
I nearly got gored.

Yeah, well, word to the wise, boys,
not that either of you qualify,

38:55.199 --> 38:57.326

a peaceful sleep

39:01.372 --> 39:02.703
You get my drift?

39:02.807 --> 39:05.935
You want us to stay out here?

39:06.210 --> 39:09.111
Well, there still might be
some stragglers coming in, yeah.

39:09.213 --> 39:10.737
All night?

39:10.848 --> 39:14.011
Well, I don't mean all day.

39:14.118 --> 39:16.348
Figure the two of you
are full of enough bull

39:16.454 --> 39:19.048
you can keep yourselves
entertained until morning.

39:33.571 --> 39:35.835
No, I am not flipping out, Marnie.

39:35.940 --> 39:38.909
I am flipping eggs.
I am flipping tortillas.

39:39.009 --> 39:40.840
I'm flipping them onto plates.

39:40.945 --> 39:44.176
But I'm not flipping out.

39:44.281 --> 39:47.307
Cilantro?
But I don't have any cilantro!

39:47.418 --> 39:51.081
Well, what kind of substitution?

39:51.188 --> 39:52.815
Italian parsley?

39:52.923 --> 39:54.652
<i>Huevos rancheros</i>...
isn't that Mexican?

39:54.759 --> 39:57.887
What does Italian parsley
have to do with anything?

39:57.995 --> 40:01.192
Anyway, it doesn't matter
because I don't have any.

40:01.298 --> 40:03.163
Something green?

40:03.267 --> 40:07.101
Now, that I can handle.

40:07.538 --> 40:10.234
Has to be edible?
Why didn't you say so?

40:10.341 --> 40:12.275
Why does this have to be
so complicated?

40:12.376 --> 40:14.844
Why can't I just open a can,
open a jar,

40:14.945 --> 40:19.678
put it on some corn tortillas
and call it a day?

40:23.220 --> 40:26.348
Actually, it doesn't look that bad.

40:26.457 --> 40:28.049
Tastes pretty good, too.

40:28.159 --> 40:30.218
Turns out I didn't miss
the cilantro after all.

40:30.327 --> 40:32.625
Thanks, Marnie. Bye.

40:38.569 --> 40:41.037
- So you're sure about this?
- Yeah.

40:41.138 --> 40:43.231
It's a big decision.

40:43.340 --> 40:45.365
I'm good with it.
No strings attached.

40:47.912 --> 40:48.970
Hey.

40:50.948 --> 40:52.882
You're forgetting something.

40:53.684 --> 40:54.582
What's that?

40:54.685 --> 40:57.848
Well, I don't have your number.

40:58.122 --> 40:58.850
Ah.

40:58.956 --> 40:59.980
Sure.

41:02.927 --> 41:05.760
Let's keep in touch.

41:20.978 --> 41:25.677
Hey, it's Tim.
Just keeping in touch.

41:34.058 --> 41:37.027
So, how was the cattle drive?

41:37.127 --> 41:38.059
It was okay.

41:38.162 --> 41:39.561
Just okay?

41:39.663 --> 41:41.255
It was great.

41:41.999 --> 41:45.594
It was the best damn cattle drive
in the history of the entire world.

41:45.703 --> 41:49.662
You would have hated it.
Stampedes. Fist fights.

41:49.773 --> 41:51.707
Ty got kicked in the face by a cow.

41:51.809 --> 41:55.609
And don't even get me started
on the toilets.

41:59.283 --> 42:01.183
Hey, Lou!
Are those the horses?

42:01.285 --> 42:02.912
Is it time for the trail ride?

42:03.020 --> 42:06.080
I'm so excited! I can't wait!

42:06.190 --> 42:07.179
Lou?

42:07.291 --> 42:08.588
My first guests.

42:08.692 --> 42:11.422
They just showed up.
A week early.

42:11.529 --> 42:12.496
Hey there, cowboy.

42:12.596 --> 42:14.120
What about your weekend
with Scott?

42:14.231 --> 42:15.630
You knew?

42:15.733 --> 42:17.598
Hard to miss.

42:17.701 --> 42:22.195
It didn't quite work out
according to plan.

42:24.575 --> 42:27.976
So who's ready to ride the range?

42:28.979 --> 42:30.378
This will be great for my blog.

42:30.581 --> 42:32.412
- Let's hit the trail!
- Yee-haw!

42:32.516 --> 42:35.815
You know, Callie,
about last night, I...

42:35.920 --> 42:39.879
It wasrt exactly something
I was looking for, but...

42:39.990 --> 42:42.652
It was nice.

42:42.960 --> 42:44.325
It was a nice surprise.

42:44.428 --> 42:46.419
Yeah, but people are gonna talk.

42:46.530 --> 42:48.657
Yeah, no.
It looks really bad.

42:48.766 --> 42:50.097
Gonna say I was using you.

42:50.234 --> 42:52.168
And were you?

42:52.269 --> 42:54.066
Well, if you get to know me better,

42:54.171 --> 42:56.139
you probably won't have to ask
that question.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.105
Yeah?
And whers that going to start?

43:02.746 --> 43:05.647
I think it just did.

43:09.353 --> 43:10.786
You sure about this?

43:10.888 --> 43:12.913
I am sure.

43:13.023 --> 43:14.820
You're right. I don't know
what I was thinking.

43:14.925 --> 43:16.051
It's a ridiculous saddle.

43:16.160 --> 43:18.185
It's got all the bells and whistles.

43:18.295 --> 43:23.164
One thing you don't need
is more bells and whistles.

43:24.802 --> 43:26.201
Hey. Hey, Jack.

43:26.737 --> 43:28.466
Yeah...

43:28.572 --> 43:30.938
Jack, I got to thank you
for introducing me to Callie.

43:31.041 --> 43:31.837
My pleasure.

43:31.942 --> 43:34.467
Yeah, it must have been something
you said about those longhorns,

43:34.578 --> 43:37.376
because, well, I just couldn't stand
to see them left behind.

43:38.115 --> 43:40.015
You bought Ray's longhorns?

43:40.184 --> 43:43.051
I bought the longhorns. Yeah.

43:43.687 --> 43:46.747
And Callie sold me
the whole damn outfit.

43:46.857 --> 43:48.484
601 acres.

43:51.662 --> 43:53.857
I got to tell the girls.

43:54.264 --> 43:56.664
Well.
