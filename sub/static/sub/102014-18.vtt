00:03.754 --> 00:06.298
Here you go, Betty.
And these are on the house.

00:06.298 --> 00:07.758
Thank you, Fangs.

00:08.926 --> 00:10.844
Thank you, guys,
for rallying.

00:10.844 --> 00:11.845
Of course.

00:13.305 --> 00:14.431
How are you holding up, B?

00:16.892 --> 00:18.977
As good as I can be,
I guess.

00:18.977 --> 00:20.270
How are the twins doing?

00:21.980 --> 00:25.692
[sighs] They're okay,
surprisingly.

00:25.692 --> 00:29.863
Cheryl volunteered
to take them for a few days.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.991
They have been asking
about their mom, though.

00:32.991 --> 00:37.913
And I told them that
she's somewhere beautiful
and close by.

00:37.913 --> 00:40.249
We hung up a hummingbird feeder
in the rose garden,

00:40.249 --> 00:42.417
and they wait for their mommy
to come visit it.

00:42.417 --> 00:43.543
That's beautiful, Cheryl.

00:46.713 --> 00:47.965
How's your mom?

00:47.965 --> 00:50.425
She's not good, Jug.

00:50.425 --> 00:52.552
She won't leave
the house.

00:52.552 --> 00:57.557
She's listening
to this Next to Normal
cast album on repeat.

00:57.557 --> 00:59.434
What's Next to Normal?

00:59.434 --> 01:02.938
It's a Broadway musical
that she took Polly and I
to see

01:04.314 --> 01:07.734
one year
for Mother's Day in the city.

01:08.568 --> 01:09.987
What's it about?

01:09.987 --> 01:11.488
This family.
[exhales sharply]

01:13.657 --> 01:17.286
To be honest, watching it,
I felt like

01:17.286 --> 01:21.123
it could have been [sniffles]
about us. [chuckles]

01:23.208 --> 01:29.965
The mom, she wants
this normal, perfect family,

01:29.965 --> 01:32.676
[sniffles]
but she's lying to herself.

01:34.386 --> 01:36.847
She and her husband
don't love each other anymore.

01:38.974 --> 01:40.642
She fights
with her daughter a lot,

01:40.642 --> 01:46.106
and one of her kids
is... dead.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.233
Jeez, Betty.

01:48.233 --> 01:49.985
It's actually
a really beautiful show.

01:52.446 --> 01:56.575
And we had the best day.

01:56.575 --> 01:59.119
Just the three of us
walking around New York.

02:01.413 --> 02:04.750
So your mom is just listening
to this album?

02:04.750 --> 02:06.251
Over and over again.

we're just on standby

for whatever they need.

In the meantime, Archie,
I've been thinking.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.757
Those seven years
we lost after graduation,

04:19.426 --> 04:22.971
-I don't want to lose any more.
-Yeah. Me neither.

04:22.971 --> 04:28.143
So, what do you think
about us moving in together?

04:30.812 --> 04:32.606
Wow. Seriously?

04:32.606 --> 04:34.983
I think
it's an amazing idea.

04:34.983 --> 04:37.819
Honestly, I'm surprised
that you're okay with living
with roommates.

04:37.819 --> 04:41.615
Oh, I just assumed
we'd live here
at the Pembrooke.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.533
Long-term, my house
has a little more room.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.827
-We'd be able
to grow into it.

All right, yeah.
Let's give it a go, lover.

04:54.794 --> 04:56.922
[Toni] Waldo,
what's going on?

04:56.922 --> 05:00.634
We have a bit of a situation
with one of our students,
Britta Beach.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.093
Oh, no.
Is she okay?

05:02.093 --> 05:04.387
Oh, she's fine.

05:04.387 --> 05:07.098
But our janitor, Mr. Poppins,
found her in a closet
under the stairwell.

05:07.098 --> 05:08.600
Seems she's been living there.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.061
Well, sadly,
I can guess why.

05:11.061 --> 05:13.021
-Where is she now?
-In the cafeteria.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.856
Getting a hot breakfast.

05:14.856 --> 05:16.942
-Can you help?
-Of course.

05:16.942 --> 05:18.485
And I think I know
who to call.

05:18.485 --> 05:21.112
Britta, this is
a friend of mine, Ms. Weiss.

05:21.112 --> 05:23.990
She's a social worker
just like me.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.825
Do you want to tell us
what's been going on?

05:31.998 --> 05:36.086
My parents
basically kicked me out.

05:36.086 --> 05:39.839
They blamed me
getting kidnapped
by those crazy brothers

05:39.839 --> 05:42.092
on my deviant gay lifestyle.

05:42.092 --> 05:46.179
Britta, there's nothing
deviant about you
or your identity.

05:46.179 --> 05:49.766
Matter of fact,
you're perfect,
and we support you.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.893
I have a full house
of foster kids,

05:51.893 --> 05:54.604

at least for a few nights.

to come with me?
