00:53.685 --> 00:57.148
During the
human wars many people died,

00:57.150 --> 01:00.583
if it was the Ukranians creating
a virus to wipe out Russia

01:00.585 --> 01:03.649
or the U.S. Setting off
nuclear weapons to Iraq

01:03.651 --> 01:04.784
very few humans survived.

01:06.183 --> 01:09.214
After the wars, governments
fell and civilians took over,

01:09.216 --> 01:10.748
creating their own leaders.

01:10.750 --> 01:13.515
Only 10 countries remained
and divided up the world.

01:13.517 --> 01:16.481
Those countries were
collectively known as sectors.

01:16.483 --> 01:18.214
The U.S. Sector grew
to be the biggest

01:18.216 --> 01:19.750
and most powerful of them all.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.413
But humans are not the only
ones who walk this planet.

01:23.415 --> 01:26.147
Deviants are also living
throughout the sectors,

01:26.149 --> 01:28.014
hidden and trying to stay alive.

01:28.016 --> 01:30.246
I am one of them and
like many others I fight

01:30.248 --> 01:33.414
against those who want to rid
the planet of the gifted ones.

01:42.648 --> 01:45.211
It began with the civil
battles where humans

01:45.213 --> 01:47.813
would control our
powers with UV charges.

01:49.015 --> 01:52.244
Each year humans capture
and torture Deviants.

01:52.246 --> 01:54.012
They then force them to
fight and kill each other

01:54.014 --> 01:56.111
to find their vanquisher.

01:56.113 --> 01:57.944
The one that would
represent their Sector

01:57.946 --> 02:01.578
at the main tournament
Dominion's Battle.

03:31.906 --> 03:34.869
Dominion's Battle,
an event created

03:34.871 --> 03:36.170
by madman Dominion Harvey.

03:37.104 --> 03:39.601
He runs and operates
The Immortal Wars,

03:39.603 --> 03:42.202
a television show aired
to the entire world.

03:42.204 --> 03:44.669
This fight is held by the
U.S. and it has become

03:44.671 --> 03:47.801
the world's biggest
entertainment corporation.

03:47.803 --> 03:49.436
Humans wait all
year for this day.

03:58.269 --> 04:01.800
These are dark days and
the darkest of them all

04:01.802 --> 04:04.535
is when the world will
watch us fight to the death.

04:18.100 --> 04:19.368
That's not the one.

05:15.295 --> 05:17.161
Bag her up, let's take her.

05:38.660 --> 05:39.493
Hey.

05:46.192 --> 05:48.360
You are a vanquisher?

07:11.452 --> 07:13.951
Can you make sure the
guards have these things

07:13.953 --> 07:14.719
fully charged at all times.

07:17.151 --> 07:19.418
I still don't know
why we use these things.

07:20.684 --> 07:22.349
What are you, brain dead?

07:22.351 --> 07:25.315
These UV rays are the only
thing keeping your ass alive.

07:25.317 --> 07:27.916
Without these we'd
lose all control.

07:27.918 --> 07:29.618
Little obsessive,
don't you think?

07:32.284 --> 07:34.683
Did you develop a
soft spot for the skags?

07:36.517 --> 07:39.617
You're old, Costa,
and you're weak.

07:41.083 --> 07:42.381
Maybe that's why you've
been making all those

07:42.383 --> 07:43.750
little mistakes in the field.

07:44.949 --> 07:47.080
Like I said, that
was out of my control.

07:47.082 --> 07:49.315
Yeah, but it was still
your team though, wasn't it?

07:50.681 --> 07:55.146
I can't wait to see what Dominion
has to say about all this.

07:55.148 --> 07:57.448
Considering you're number
one on his shit list now.

08:00.314 --> 08:06.112
Sir, they're asking for you.

08:06.114 --> 08:06.781
Have fun.

10:08.871 --> 10:10.535
Move.

10:10.537 --> 10:11.535
What is this place?

10:11.537 --> 10:13.602
Well it looks like
a jail, doesn't it?

10:13.604 --> 10:15.234
Now move, skag.

10:15.236 --> 10:18.434
No, you've got
to tell me what's...

10:22.636 --> 10:23.669
You wanna try again?

10:24.603 --> 10:25.703
This is your home now.

10:26.969 --> 10:28.568
You better get real comfy, skag.

10:45.600 --> 10:46.434
Sir.

10:47.501 --> 10:48.565
What is it?

10:48.567 --> 10:50.100
You requested my presence.

10:56.398 --> 10:58.465
Sir, I apologize for my mistake.

11:01.633 --> 11:02.630
Would you like a drink?

11:02.632 --> 11:03.763
No, I'm fine thank you.

11:03.765 --> 11:06.230
So what happened today?

11:06.232 --> 11:08.395
It was a small
mistake, my guys they...

11:08.397 --> 11:10.531
Ah ah, get one thing straight.

11:11.665 --> 11:12.332
These are my guys.

11:13.532 --> 11:16.395
They didn't secure the Deviant
correctly and it escaped.

11:16.397 --> 11:18.963
So a group of highly
trained guards made a mistake

11:18.965 --> 11:21.862
that gave my Deviant
the chance to escape.

11:21.864 --> 11:24.062
A mistake that
risked everything.

11:24.064 --> 11:27.096
My Sector, my network my show.

11:27.996 --> 11:29.962
Sir I apologize.

11:29.964 --> 11:32.794
Son, how long have you
been fighting for us?

11:32.796 --> 11:34.694
Since I was valid.

11:34.696 --> 11:35.462
Which is?

11:36.330 --> 11:37.163
Six years.

11:38.163 --> 11:39.729
You know mistakes
can never happen.

11:41.062 --> 11:43.026
There's no time for them.

11:43.028 --> 11:46.127
Yes sir and I promise it
will never happen again.

11:47.595 --> 11:50.028
It will never happen again.

11:51.495 --> 11:57.492
Guards, can you please
take the trash out.

11:57.494 --> 11:58.792
What trash?

12:19.025 --> 12:20.059
Did you hear?

12:20.825 --> 12:22.923
Costa expired this morning.

12:22.925 --> 12:23.692
How?

12:25.058 --> 12:28.690
They said he shot
himself right in the head.

12:28.692 --> 12:29.957
That's bullshit.

12:29.959 --> 12:31.658
They got him for
what his team did.

12:32.724 --> 12:34.188
You serious?

12:34.190 --> 12:36.691
Yeah, you think there's
time for mistakes?

12:37.958 --> 12:42.655
No but hey that just give
us a chance to move up.

12:42.657 --> 12:43.591
I'm okay with that.

12:45.356 --> 12:46.156
Right.

12:53.490 --> 12:56.720
Hey you think the
game's gonna be as brutal

12:56.722 --> 12:57.988
this year as last year?

12:59.455 --> 13:02.154
They can all kill each
other for all I care.

13:03.221 --> 13:04.555
As long as they're
not on our streets.

13:33.752 --> 13:35.152
What's wrong with you?

13:37.519 --> 13:39.751
How did a girl like
you make it this far?

13:40.952 --> 13:45.049
It's not my choice to
be here, they forced me.

13:45.051 --> 13:46.051
We all were.

13:49.718 --> 13:52.648
So tell me your story.

13:52.650 --> 13:53.584
How'd you end up here?

13:54.918 --> 13:58.983
There is no story, I
wasn't supposed to be here.

14:00.116 --> 14:01.717
I'm tired of fighting.

14:03.049 --> 14:07.983
But I will do what I
have to do to survive.

14:09.149 --> 14:12.082
I just want to be free and
live the life I have left.

14:15.114 --> 14:16.148
Yeah me too.

14:19.883 --> 14:21.746
L talk to me.

14:21.748 --> 14:22.979
We're good.

14:22.981 --> 14:24.179
How good?

14:24.181 --> 14:25.880
We're broadcasting
to all Sectors.

14:25.882 --> 14:28.178
Russia, Africa, Mexico
each one's ready for us.

14:28.180 --> 14:29.412
That's why I love you.

14:29.414 --> 14:32.113
Now time to greet
our special guests.

14:54.378 --> 14:57.612
What will you do when
we're in front of the world?

15:01.111 --> 15:02.709
I won't fight you.

15:02.711 --> 15:07.511
When the time comes I will
fight you and I will win.

15:09.377 --> 15:11.177
You think you
can beat Nyx Moros?

15:12.177 --> 15:14.276
You ask as if it's
going to be hard.

15:16.243 --> 15:18.908
She is a monster, a murderer.

15:18.910 --> 15:21.443
She killed her own brother
for this sick game.

15:22.777 --> 15:24.710
The god of Deserts and storms.

15:34.776 --> 15:36.907
I told you, you can't win.

15:36.909 --> 15:38.274
I'm stronger than you.

15:44.474 --> 15:48.673
No you're wrong.

15:48.675 --> 15:49.675
I'm stronger.

15:56.406 --> 15:57.972
But I couldn't
hurt my own family.

16:07.506 --> 16:11.169
You see that's the
difference between you and I.

16:11.171 --> 16:15.638
When we were forced
into this, this game,

16:16.939 --> 16:20.902
I put to side the fact
that you were my brother,

16:20.904 --> 16:25.338
and I made you my enemy.

16:36.304 --> 16:40.069
This is the end,
you ready to die?

16:41.036 --> 16:43.369
We both know this
isn't the end of me.

16:49.870 --> 16:52.335
Give them what they want.

17:14.165 --> 17:17.631
Seth was one of the strongest
deviants known to man.

17:17.633 --> 17:20.597
Nothing will stop her
from killing anyone

17:20.598 --> 17:23.464
who gets in her way.

17:23.465 --> 17:24.332
Maybe this will.

17:27.531 --> 17:29.063
This place is
surrounded by UV lines.

17:29.065 --> 17:31.732
We can't use any of our
powers, they control it all.

17:33.531 --> 17:35.031
So tell me about yourself.

17:35.932 --> 17:38.094
We are going to be
here for a while,

17:38.096 --> 17:41.465
might as well know a little
bit about my next victim.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.630
I'm just messing around.

17:47.831 --> 17:51.996
Well, I was seven when
my family found out.

17:53.864 --> 17:55.595
Found out what?

17:55.597 --> 17:56.861
What I am.

17:56.863 --> 18:02.626
They grew hatred towards me,
so I ran away and started over.

18:02.628 --> 18:05.362
I then began to fight for
those who needed help.

18:07.062 --> 18:12.261
But then when I found out
what I was capable of I got...

18:25.060 --> 18:26.092
You okay?

18:29.194 --> 18:31.058
So what's your name?

18:31.060 --> 18:33.726
Olive, Olive Summerlin.

18:35.927 --> 18:38.225
No, I meant what
do they call you?

18:40.525 --> 18:41.626
What do they call you?

18:42.927 --> 18:45.192
Oh uh, Trikalypse.

18:47.659 --> 18:48.492
Cool.

18:49.891 --> 18:50.955
You?

18:50.957 --> 18:52.124
Iro.

18:53.859 --> 18:54.692
Cool.

19:55.885 --> 19:57.117
How about something to eat?

19:57.119 --> 19:59.983
How about something to eat?

19:59.985 --> 20:01.152
Maybe, skag.

20:02.718 --> 20:04.685
I said maybe, skag.

20:10.018 --> 20:15.083
Maybe you oughta come
into this cell, huh?

20:16.083 --> 20:17.117
You know what?

20:18.083 --> 20:20.247
That sounds like a good idea.

20:20.249 --> 20:21.114
Really?

20:21.116 --> 20:22.315
- Come on.
- You know what they say.

20:22.317 --> 20:23.948
Once you go black,
they never come back.

20:23.950 --> 20:24.916
Maybe next time princess.

20:24.918 --> 20:26.683
I want something to eat!

20:28.082 --> 20:29.082
What does that do?

20:30.249 --> 20:36.281
It scans the body, it records
strength, power, health.

20:36.283 --> 20:38.449
It's how they know who to pair
us up with for each fight.

20:43.649 --> 20:45.214
How do you know all this?

20:47.015 --> 20:49.113
I knew I would
be here some day.

20:49.115 --> 20:50.314
I looked into everything.

20:52.448 --> 20:58.178
I did my research
and prepared myself.

20:58.180 --> 20:58.947
Step forward skag.

21:00.247 --> 21:02.178
She thought that
you were me, huh?

21:02.180 --> 21:03.478
Step forward
for evaluation!

21:03.480 --> 21:07.077
Hey I'm sorry, I
didn't hear you there.

21:07.079 --> 21:09.012
You can try to keep us in here,

21:09.978 --> 21:12.413
but it ain't gonna
work, you know why?

21:13.346 --> 21:15.544
There's a revolution
coming, brother.

21:15.546 --> 21:19.243
I'm gonna make sure your
black ass dies first.

21:19.245 --> 21:20.142
I'd love to see that.

21:20.144 --> 21:22.009
You will see that.

21:22.011 --> 21:23.342
See if you can
get your power off

21:23.344 --> 21:25.579
before I put two hollow
points between your eyes.

21:41.343 --> 21:46.543
Gentlemen, for years the
world has been divided.

21:47.810 --> 21:49.643
Rich and poor, strong and weak.

21:51.109 --> 21:54.309
And the question is which
category do you fall into?

21:55.543 --> 21:59.406
As we witnessed, the
last year of the feathers

21:59.408 --> 22:03.206
the Phoenix rose to be the
Victor and as we all know

22:03.208 --> 22:05.941
this is the age of the snake.

22:07.375 --> 22:12.574
Every 365 days we work hard
and prepare for today's events.

22:14.207 --> 22:18.071
The day our people come together
and watch how we're making

22:18.073 --> 22:19.274
the world a better place.

22:20.573 --> 22:24.671
Now it's time to reveal
which serpent will represent

22:24.673 --> 22:25.936
your sector at the table.

22:25.938 --> 22:28.373
France we'll begin with you.

24:33.695 --> 24:35.328
and expel electricity.

24:36.429 --> 24:41.394
Iro, Mexico, ability to
manipulate and control fire.

24:43.261 --> 24:47.058
Dekay, India, skilled assassin,

24:47.060 --> 24:51.758
ability of breath and touch
generating the dark force.

24:51.760 --> 24:53.226
Very interesting.

24:54.360 --> 24:59.858
Trikalypse, United States,
telekinesis, superstrength

24:59.860 --> 25:01.992
and durability, telepathy,

25:02.859 --> 25:05.492
ability to absorb powers
with body contact.

25:09.058 --> 25:11.626
I take it we have all
selected our battle grounds?

25:20.690 --> 25:22.823
The time for entry is now,

25:22.825 --> 25:26.056
please proceed to
cell block four.

26:17.686 --> 26:19.019
They say she's a god.

26:22.018 --> 26:24.153
They say Nyx Moros
is an Egyptian god.

26:25.352 --> 26:28.485
How else do you think she
was able to kill Seth?

27:07.947 --> 27:08.981
Looks good.

27:12.014 --> 27:13.713
I take it this
is for the show.

27:13.715 --> 27:14.947
We are the stars.

27:29.080 --> 27:30.680
So what happens next?

27:31.979 --> 27:34.344
Well now that they
have scanned us.

27:34.346 --> 27:36.844
They are going to ranks
us one through 10.

27:36.846 --> 27:39.212
That will then determine
who we fight first.

27:40.246 --> 27:42.446
Then what happens after that?

27:43.944 --> 27:46.777
Right now we are all going to
be visited by 10 individuals.

27:46.779 --> 27:48.345
The ones who brought us here.

27:49.245 --> 27:51.445
Then they will
register us for entry.

27:52.612 --> 27:53.978
Then it begins.

27:54.911 --> 27:57.842
We will be hit by the
shrill three times.

27:57.844 --> 27:59.377
We will be to weak to stand.

28:00.511 --> 28:04.709
And then we'll be announced
to the world of who we are

28:04.711 --> 28:06.511
and what we can do.

28:09.176 --> 28:14.375
Then the final 24 hours of
our lives begin to count down.

29:05.805 --> 29:09.536
Get me the hell out of here!

29:09.538 --> 29:13.435
Haven't you noticed
you're surrounded by steel?

29:13.437 --> 29:15.968
You could have escaped
by now if you wanted to.

29:15.970 --> 29:18.604
But no, here you are caged.

29:20.804 --> 29:22.168
Why is that?

29:22.170 --> 29:26.200
Nowhere to go,
nothing to return to.

29:26.202 --> 29:29.501
Let's get something
perfectly straight right now.

29:29.503 --> 29:31.069
This is your life now.

29:31.870 --> 29:33.734
You have nowhere else to go.

29:33.736 --> 29:37.100
This is not my life, this
was a diversion, a distraction.

29:37.102 --> 29:39.566
All I have to do
now is just sit back

29:39.568 --> 29:41.301
and watch it crumble around you.

29:44.368 --> 29:46.166
Better yet, I'll listen to
the distraction carry on.

29:46.168 --> 29:49.601
I am done fighting for you.

29:50.501 --> 29:51.334
Game over!

29:52.200 --> 29:54.000
You've clearly lost your mind.

30:12.633 --> 30:13.599
Dominion didn't come.

30:15.931 --> 30:17.830
You're registered
automatically.

30:17.832 --> 30:19.930
You actually think
he'll come down here?

30:39.730 --> 30:41.663
What are they
going to do to him?

30:43.095 --> 30:45.496
They're taking him
down to cell block one.

30:54.562 --> 30:55.894
What's in cell block one?

31:02.161 --> 31:05.459
Cell block one is no
cell block its more like

31:05.461 --> 31:07.158
the sewers chambers.

31:07.160 --> 31:09.225
A dark hall that
not even a speck

31:09.227 --> 31:10.594
of sunlight will ever shine.

31:12.027 --> 31:14.525
Its said that Dominion throws
any deviant that does not obey

31:14.527 --> 31:19.224
his laws and for those who
cannot take captivity well.

31:19.226 --> 31:23.290
They are only fed medications
that slowly kill them.

31:23.292 --> 31:25.824
They say some of
them are also used

31:25.826 --> 31:27.626
for genetic experimentations.

32:04.690 --> 32:05.922
Leo.

32:10.689 --> 32:11.522
Who is he?

32:12.422 --> 32:13.321
Our replacement.

32:14.322 --> 32:16.053
He replaces us if any one of us

32:16.055 --> 32:17.655
does not make it
to registration.

32:18.856 --> 32:20.654
Think of it as him
being on standby.

32:22.354 --> 32:25.286
They announced him months
before the civil battles.

32:39.186 --> 32:40.520
And we are locked in.

32:41.919 --> 32:43.619
We are locked and ready to go.

32:48.918 --> 32:52.052
Gentlemen, it
is now show time.

32:53.853 --> 32:55.984
May the strongest win.

33:07.083 --> 33:08.584
Okay we are in, In 5 4...

33:17.016 --> 33:18.980
Hello citizens of the world.

33:18.982 --> 33:20.547
It Is that time
of the age again.

33:20.549 --> 33:23.147
The time all our hard
work and dedication

33:23.149 --> 33:25.646
will be put to the test.

33:25.648 --> 33:28.346
In years past we have witnessed
some heartfelt moments.

33:28.348 --> 33:30.880
- Hey it's starting, come on.
- We have watched some of

33:30.882 --> 33:32.346
the greatest succeed
and some fail.

33:32.348 --> 33:35.382
But this year it will
be one for the books.

33:36.648 --> 33:40.080
In my hand I have the list
of the Immortal Wars VQ's.

33:41.482 --> 33:44.445
Now I don't know about you,
but I am beyond excited

33:44.447 --> 33:45.947
for this year's selections.

33:47.180 --> 33:51.877
I've even heard that this year
one of the strongest Deviants

33:51.879 --> 33:53.246
ever recorded in history.

33:54.848 --> 33:55.912
Now let us begin.

33:59.046 --> 34:03.045
First up we have The Charge
with a rank of a five.

34:04.412 --> 34:07.479
Next we have Atmo
ranked at a six.

34:08.878 --> 34:11.344
England's Leo ranked
with a number seven.

34:12.909 --> 34:17.007
Karly and The Tank ranked
together at a seven.

34:17.010 --> 34:19.875
Sin is also a seven.

34:19.877 --> 34:22.743
Iro ranked at an eight.

34:22.745 --> 34:25.475
Aiolos with a rank of an eight.

34:25.476 --> 34:28.608
Blackout ranked at an eight.

34:28.610 --> 34:31.409
Dekay ranked at a nine.

34:32.610 --> 34:37.942
And finally last but not least,
Trikalypse ranked at a 10.

34:46.641 --> 34:48.306
Now I know this has never
happened before in the ages

34:48.309 --> 34:51.141
of the Immortal Wars, but
this is history in the making.

34:52.375 --> 34:57.905
So on behalf of the city of
Lambent, let the battles begin.

34:57.907 --> 34:59.039
My moneys on the US.

34:59.041 --> 35:00.806
No India's got it,
she looks ruthless.

35:00.808 --> 35:03.906
$100 down for the US
make it the third round.

35:06.807 --> 35:08.841
This years going
to a good year, huh?

35:08.906 --> 35:10.073
Yes it is.

35:14.406 --> 35:16.339
Wait she was right.

35:17.172 --> 35:19.370
Weakest versus strongest.

35:19.372 --> 35:22.771
Eliminate the weak
so the strong have to

35:22.773 --> 35:24.139
fight against each other.

35:25.205 --> 35:26.638
It will make for a great show.

35:28.438 --> 35:30.570
How do you know all this?

35:30.572 --> 35:32.435
Like I said I did my research.

35:32.437 --> 35:34.902
Research gives you
only so much information,

35:34.904 --> 35:36.038
you know everything.

35:44.536 --> 35:47.471
When you said that you
knew you would be here,

35:48.637 --> 35:52.936
you actually meant you wanted
to be here, am I right?

35:58.068 --> 36:02.235
You're right, I
chose to be here.

36:10.701 --> 36:13.232
My mother was killed
five years ago

36:13.234 --> 36:15.067
at the 10th age Immortal Wars.

36:17.934 --> 36:20.200
She didn't make it
past the second round.

36:22.933 --> 36:24.864
She was in contact
with my father

36:24.866 --> 36:26.433
through one of
Dominion's slaves.

36:27.767 --> 36:31.863
But Dominion found
out and had her killed

36:31.865 --> 36:33.965
as well as my father soon after.

36:36.998 --> 36:38.998
But not before he
told me everything.

36:43.864 --> 36:45.262
That's why I'm here.

36:45.264 --> 36:47.995
Dominion will pay
for what he has done

36:47.997 --> 36:49.962
and nothing's gonna stop me.

36:49.964 --> 36:52.029
That's not the
job for one person.

36:52.031 --> 36:55.994
It's bigger than you, it's
bigger than both of us.

36:55.996 --> 36:57.994
It's not one man that
needs to be stopped,

36:57.996 --> 36:59.230
it's the whole government.

37:00.263 --> 37:02.564
We've been forced to
forget what peace is.

37:04.430 --> 37:05.497
Then what do we do?

37:09.096 --> 37:13.462
We play, we fight,
and we survive.

37:15.096 --> 37:16.862
But we don't entertain.

37:38.860 --> 37:39.893
Five man.

37:47.892 --> 37:50.858
Oy, what makes you
so special huh?

37:55.559 --> 37:58.958
How about you come in
here and I can show you.

38:02.558 --> 38:05.425
I mean it, let me show you.

38:09.257 --> 38:12.556
Tempting, however
let's bring our romance

38:12.558 --> 38:13.457
to the battlefield.

38:24.656 --> 38:29.223
Hi, what's your name?

38:41.189 --> 38:45.621
I'm Karly, this is The Tank.

40:00.015 --> 40:01.079
How is our leading lady doing?

40:01.081 --> 40:04.813
Well since you
asked quite excited.

40:04.815 --> 40:07.178
I was able to get a
glimpse of the top 10.

40:07.180 --> 40:09.279
I hope you weren't
disappointed.

40:09.281 --> 40:14.246
No, so when I win the
final round what happens?

40:16.946 --> 40:19.344
You will receive your awards.

40:19.346 --> 40:20.112
Which are?

40:20.878 --> 40:22.979
Power, freedom.

40:24.380 --> 40:26.279
Then lets get
this thing started.

40:30.678 --> 40:32.242
Well citizens it is time.

40:32.244 --> 40:34.344
Please stop what you
are doing and join us

40:34.346 --> 40:37.042
in this new age of
the Immortal Wars.

40:37.044 --> 40:39.142
Our representatives
have been matched

40:39.144 --> 40:41.578
and first up we have
Leo Versus Black.

40:43.077 --> 40:44.542
Now this will Germany's
strongest fighter

40:44.544 --> 40:45.941
since about two years ago.

40:45.943 --> 40:48.209
They have had some rough times.

40:48.211 --> 40:50.974
England, on the other
hand, has dominated.

40:50.976 --> 40:54.408
However, they have had to
remove their primary fighter

40:54.410 --> 40:55.940
due to medical reasons.

40:55.942 --> 40:59.675
Leo has been selected
to fill those shoes.

40:59.677 --> 41:01.209
Okay lets bring up the lights.

41:04.042 --> 41:06.074
Environment bring up the sound.

41:06.076 --> 41:08.673
Easy, easy, easy, nice and slow.

41:08.675 --> 41:11.276
And, go.

41:33.006 --> 41:35.406
So are you ready?

41:37.640 --> 41:42.073
Are you?

41:44.672 --> 41:46.272
A great way to start the show.

41:48.339 --> 41:50.470
Good one.

42:05.237 --> 42:06.169
How was that?

42:06.171 --> 42:09.070
You shouldn't have done that.

42:50.366 --> 42:52.400
Now that's the
way to start a show!

43:01.398 --> 43:02.697
Who will be next?

43:02.699 --> 43:03.899
Stay tuned after
this quick break.

43:25.929 --> 43:28.729
Tank I don't want to die.

43:28.731 --> 43:29.497
This is wrong.

43:30.896 --> 43:32.161
How do we even have a
chance against each other

43:32.163 --> 43:34.862
if they make us so
weak before each fight.

43:35.797 --> 43:37.060
Before each fight
they're going to

43:37.062 --> 43:38.928
inject us with UV Charges.

43:40.128 --> 43:44.360
It's a small dose but enough
to spike up our energy,

43:44.362 --> 43:45.395
powers, strength.

43:46.861 --> 43:49.925
The next couple of fights
are going to go by fast.

43:49.927 --> 43:51.693
They're gonna save
the strongest for last

43:51.695 --> 43:54.925
and get rid of the weak first.

43:54.927 --> 43:58.227
Then it will be us
against each other.

44:04.694 --> 44:06.060
Who's next?

44:08.360 --> 44:09.891
The kid.

47:40.442 --> 47:42.974
They say you're a nine, huh?

47:46.775 --> 47:48.937
I've seen better.

47:48.939 --> 47:50.206
Watch this.

47:53.074 --> 47:54.772
You really need
to be working more

47:54.774 --> 47:56.906
on your fighting skills.

48:03.640 --> 48:05.571
Like that?

48:05.573 --> 48:09.439
Yeah, like that.

48:58.669 --> 48:59.568
Watch this.

49:00.701 --> 49:04.534
Is this what you
wanted to see, huh?

49:05.634 --> 49:08.867
Is this what you wanted to see?

49:48.563 --> 49:51.563
Tighter Tank, squeeze tighter.

50:11.763 --> 50:12.794
Please don't make me do this.

50:13.994 --> 50:17.126
For being a 10 you're
really are not that strong.

50:17.128 --> 50:17.960
Please.

50:21.361 --> 50:23.760
I don't want to fight her!

50:23.762 --> 50:26.327
But I will for freedom.

50:34.394 --> 50:35.227
And so will I.

50:41.493 --> 50:42.325
Yikes.

50:43.225 --> 50:44.392
She got him.

51:22.589 --> 51:23.789
I'm sorry.

51:49.553 --> 51:50.353
Tank!

51:53.720 --> 51:56.284
Tank, get up.

51:56.286 --> 51:57.386
Please get up.

52:34.915 --> 52:35.948
Well that was a
very rough round.

52:37.749 --> 52:39.782
But that is what
this game is about.

52:40.882 --> 52:44.115
The display of
strength and power.

52:46.315 --> 52:49.878
I gotta say did you all
see that coming from Iro?

52:49.880 --> 52:51.779
It's like she couldn't
take the beating anymore

52:51.781 --> 52:53.315
and just snapped!

52:54.813 --> 52:58.178
Well now is the time
to get more drinks,

52:58.180 --> 53:00.278
serve yourself up
with some more grub,

53:00.280 --> 53:02.411
pay for your losses and
collect on your winnings,

53:02.413 --> 53:05.579
because we have the
quarter finals coming

53:05.581 --> 53:07.011
right after these messages.

53:07.013 --> 53:10.146
We will be right back with
some more Immortal Wars.

54:26.506 --> 54:28.704
I killed her kids.

54:28.706 --> 54:29.473
I Killed three children.

54:53.237 --> 54:54.069
Make me live.

54:55.802 --> 54:56.837
Yes sir.

54:59.237 --> 55:00.069
You're in.

55:05.801 --> 55:08.934
Hello representatives
this is Dominion Harvey.

55:08.936 --> 55:11.234
I wanted to congratulate
you all for making it

55:11.236 --> 55:11.901
to the next round.

55:12.835 --> 55:15.002
And take the time
to share something.

55:15.968 --> 55:18.867
The one thing we all
have in common is death,

55:19.834 --> 55:21.835
the only difference
is how it happens.

55:22.935 --> 55:25.468
Your lives are not yours
anymore, they belong to me.

55:27.234 --> 55:32.331
Do what you were born
to do fight, kill, die

55:32.333 --> 55:34.900
and your passing
will be one of honor.

55:36.933 --> 55:40.164
Now, If you withstand my
wishes, I promise you agony

55:40.166 --> 55:42.898
in the lights that you never
could envision conceivable.

55:44.466 --> 55:45.299
Thank you.

55:50.798 --> 55:52.532
What do we do
now, he's on to us?

55:57.598 --> 55:59.165
We continue to play his game.

56:06.530 --> 56:11.729
Gentlemen that was a pretty
entertaining round wasn't it?

56:11.731 --> 56:13.097
Russia what happened?

56:14.397 --> 56:15.497
I was rooting for you.

56:17.663 --> 56:19.760
I thought I made
it clear to you all

56:19.762 --> 56:22.094
you had to have entered
your strongest fighter.

56:22.096 --> 56:23.227
All I see here is a group
of scared creatures,

56:23.229 --> 56:24.827
Lets see if the
final five can make

56:24.829 --> 56:26.827
the next round more superior.

56:26.829 --> 56:31.961
If not there will be some
extreme changes to come.

56:33.562 --> 56:34.395
Are you with me?

56:36.262 --> 56:37.095
Good.

57:17.225 --> 57:19.922
How many times have
I told you not to do that?

57:19.924 --> 57:23.157
Just play like
normal kids, okay?

57:40.690 --> 57:42.522
What are they doing?

57:44.656 --> 57:45.489
I don't know.

57:48.555 --> 57:50.288
2, 3, it's even now.

57:50.954 --> 57:52.122
What do you mean?

57:53.022 --> 57:55.152
Well, now that
they took Blackout,

57:55.154 --> 57:57.353
there's an even
number of fighters.

57:57.355 --> 57:58.986
You're right.

57:58.988 --> 58:00.153
What are they up to?

58:04.054 --> 58:08.285
So, how's everything looking?

58:08.287 --> 58:11.051
We did have some interference
from an unknown signal

58:11.053 --> 58:15.718
but I took care of it,
other than that we are good.

58:15.720 --> 58:18.017
All perished deviants
have been transferred

58:18.019 --> 58:19.783
to cell block two
and we're just about

58:19.785 --> 58:21.484
ready for the quarter finals.

58:21.486 --> 58:22.783
Great.

58:22.785 --> 58:24.916
What environments
do we have left?

58:24.918 --> 58:30.051
Let's see, Death
Lands, Forest of Ice,

58:31.385 --> 58:32.918
and the streets of Lambent.

58:39.017 --> 58:40.517
This round should be good.

58:49.849 --> 58:52.615
What if they make
us fight each other?

58:52.617 --> 58:54.114
They won't.

58:54.116 --> 58:56.348
They're going to put
me against Dekay.

58:56.350 --> 58:57.183
We are both the strongest.

58:58.383 --> 59:02.280
He's a business man, he'll
put us together last.

59:02.282 --> 59:05.448
He knows we're friends,
it'll make good TV.

59:08.148 --> 59:11.249
And when that time
comes we strike.

59:37.246 --> 59:39.279
Okay, you've got this.

59:42.211 --> 59:44.079
You got this, Olive.

59:57.411 --> 59:58.944
No, me, take me!

01:00:00.143 --> 01:00:01.408
I'm fighting her!

01:00:04.410 --> 01:00:05.177
Iro!

01:00:06.376 --> 01:00:07.374
Take me!

01:00:07.376 --> 01:00:08.343
Olive.

01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:18.903
This is all out
of our control.

01:01:23.302 --> 01:01:25.401
I can't fight.

01:01:25.403 --> 01:01:26.170
You're going to have to.

01:01:27.136 --> 01:01:29.733
No don't make
me give them that.

01:01:29.735 --> 01:01:31.236
I won't fight you!

01:01:32.935 --> 01:01:34.367
You think I want to die?

01:01:34.369 --> 01:01:35.301
Huh?

01:01:37.069 --> 01:01:39.701
I don't stand a
chance against you!

01:01:39.703 --> 01:01:41.299
I am walking into my own grave

01:01:41.301 --> 01:01:43.435
when I go into that
battle ground with you!

01:03:25.226 --> 01:03:26.059
Nice shots.

01:03:32.892 --> 01:03:37.425
Nice try, now it's my turn.

01:04:11.655 --> 01:04:13.553
You're a tough one aren't you?

01:04:13.555 --> 01:04:14.388
You have no idea.

01:04:23.187 --> 01:04:26.054
You actually thought you
could beat me, didn't you?

01:04:33.654 --> 01:04:35.886
Tell me, how were you
going to defeat Nyx

01:04:36.986 --> 01:04:38.420
if even I am to much for you?

01:04:41.485 --> 01:04:43.152
I never wanted Nyx.

01:05:00.418 --> 01:05:01.451
Tell me.

01:05:03.518 --> 01:05:05.450
If not Nyx, then who?

01:05:07.317 --> 01:05:08.315
Dominion.

01:05:08.317 --> 01:05:12.217
But if you get in my
way I'll kill you too.

01:05:20.049 --> 01:05:21.050
That's it.

01:05:59.546 --> 01:06:01.046
Taste your power.

01:07:33.471 --> 01:07:35.834
What did you do to her?

01:07:35.836 --> 01:07:37.103
What we are here for?

01:07:38.270 --> 01:07:39.438
Crazy bitch.

01:08:01.335 --> 01:08:05.500
What I did I did to
be free and now I'm

01:08:05.502 --> 01:08:06.834
just one steps ahead of you.

01:08:08.202 --> 01:08:11.234
I suggest you do
the same, survive.

01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:17.899
Because I can't wait to
have the chance to kill you.

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:29.930
Now that is what
I'm talking about!

01:08:29.933 --> 01:08:31.697
That was amazing.

01:08:31.698 --> 01:08:35.064
Dekay has no remorse
she's a killer.

01:08:36.365 --> 01:08:37.696
I want to fight her.

01:08:37.698 --> 01:08:40.131
Well, well now we still
have two more fights.

01:09:06.564 --> 01:09:07.397
You make sure you
win this one got it?

01:09:28.461 --> 01:09:29.826
I'm not fighting you.

01:09:31.662 --> 01:09:32.894
Oh really?

01:09:33.528 --> 01:09:34.361
Is that right?

01:09:35.426 --> 01:09:39.292
You know they won't let
you just walk out of here.

01:09:39.294 --> 01:09:40.194
You have to fight.

01:09:42.326 --> 01:09:43.158
I will not.

01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:46.756
Did you hear that?

01:09:46.759 --> 01:09:47.926
I will not fight anymore!

01:09:51.292 --> 01:09:52.225
Did she just do that?

01:09:54.325 --> 01:09:55.992
Take care of this.

01:10:07.823 --> 01:10:11.155
I told you I don't
want to fight any more.

01:10:11.157 --> 01:10:12.357
There you go.

01:10:41.388 --> 01:10:42.221
Why are you smiling?

01:10:42.921 --> 01:10:44.787
Please, don't do this.

01:10:45.488 --> 01:10:48.188
Win, you have to survive.

01:10:49.188 --> 01:10:50.553
Make Dominion pay.

01:10:50.555 --> 01:10:52.186
Please.

01:10:52.188 --> 01:10:52.920
You got this.

01:11:19.118 --> 01:11:21.051
You're forcing me to do this.

01:11:22.518 --> 01:11:23.350
Do it.

01:11:53.415 --> 01:11:54.315
What is she doing?

01:12:26.812 --> 01:12:28.079
Cut it, cut it now.

01:12:31.912 --> 01:12:34.810
It looks like she checked
if he was still alive.

01:12:39.678 --> 01:12:41.509
Is what she did not allowed?

01:12:41.511 --> 01:12:44.708
What she did made us look bad.

01:12:44.710 --> 01:12:48.841
What she did shows the world
she is good and she cares.

01:12:48.843 --> 01:12:51.209
The purpose of these
games are to show

01:12:51.211 --> 01:12:54.575
that you are all to blame for
what happened to this planet

01:12:54.577 --> 01:12:56.310
and that you are all the enemy.

01:13:06.975 --> 01:13:08.775
That last round
was pretty good.

01:13:09.742 --> 01:13:11.874
A bit sad at times,
but overall good.

01:13:13.074 --> 01:13:15.139
I bet Harvey has
a boot up his ass.

01:13:15.141 --> 01:13:16.042
What do you mean.

01:13:17.642 --> 01:13:19.540
What that girl Trikalypse did.

01:13:19.542 --> 01:13:21.739
I don't think he's
happy about that.

01:13:21.741 --> 01:13:23.274
She really made him look bad.

01:13:27.107 --> 01:13:30.671
Thank you.

01:13:30.673 --> 01:13:32.838
Wait, hold on, is this correct?

01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:34.107
Those are the orders.

01:13:38.106 --> 01:13:38.939
What is it?

01:13:45.906 --> 01:13:48.370
Can you bring up the
sound from the last fight?

01:13:48.372 --> 01:13:49.138
Yes sir.

01:13:50.338 --> 01:13:52.768
What exactly are
you looking for?

01:13:52.770 --> 01:13:53.836
They were talking
through out the fight.

01:13:53.838 --> 01:13:55.105
I want to know what was said.

01:13:56.804 --> 01:13:57.905
Okay here it is.

01:14:00.837 --> 01:14:06.435
Win, you have to
survive, make Dominion pay.

01:14:06.437 --> 01:14:07.668
Please.

01:14:07.670 --> 01:14:08.437
You got this.

01:14:14.370 --> 01:14:15.802
Make me pay, huh?

01:14:48.966 --> 01:14:50.699
Don't worry, I won't hurt you.

01:14:57.433 --> 01:14:58.367
I know you won't.

01:15:47.295 --> 01:15:49.195
Well, well, well look at us.

01:15:50.228 --> 01:15:51.360
The last two standing.

01:15:51.362 --> 01:15:53.225
Dekay don't talk.

01:15:53.227 --> 01:15:56.626
Come on, after all
we've been through

01:15:56.628 --> 01:15:59.094
I am glad it is just us left.

01:16:04.926 --> 01:16:06.226
This should be good.

01:16:07.692 --> 01:16:09.291
This is exciting.

01:16:09.293 --> 01:16:10.789
And why is that?

01:16:10.791 --> 01:16:13.924
Because the entire world
is going to watch me win

01:16:13.926 --> 01:16:17.223
and witness the
death of Trikalypse.

01:16:17.225 --> 01:16:18.292
Why?

01:16:19.758 --> 01:16:20.956
Why are you doing this?

01:16:20.958 --> 01:16:21.990
Why are you giving them a show?

01:16:21.992 --> 01:16:24.190
- We are all the same.
- No.

01:16:24.192 --> 01:16:26.058
I am something more.

01:16:27.025 --> 01:16:30.655
I am something bigger
and more powerful.

01:16:30.657 --> 01:16:32.191
Let me show you.

01:17:12.287 --> 01:17:13.719
I almost had you.

01:17:13.721 --> 01:17:16.285
Your poor little Iro
didn't have it so easy.

01:17:16.287 --> 01:17:17.519
Stop this.

01:17:17.521 --> 01:17:18.318
You're giving them
what they want.

01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:19.285
Isn't that the point?

01:17:19.287 --> 01:17:20.220
To give them a show.

01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:24.518
It's not going to
happen, stop trying.

01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:27.552
Oh bitch, you haven't
even seen me try.

01:17:44.252 --> 01:17:46.882
Can't you see the world
needs some one like me.

01:17:46.884 --> 01:17:48.084
Someone who can win.

01:17:58.716 --> 01:18:00.780
Attention fighters,
there has been a change

01:18:00.782 --> 01:18:02.047
to your orders.

01:18:02.049 --> 01:18:04.814
Three fighters
must battle it out

01:18:04.816 --> 01:18:08.849
for the last available spot.

01:18:18.315 --> 01:18:21.913
Here we go.

01:18:21.915 --> 01:18:25.513
Our viewers are jumping
up by the thousands sir.

01:18:25.515 --> 01:18:26.814
Excellent.

01:18:28.213 --> 01:18:29.279
He's here to kill us.

01:18:29.281 --> 01:18:30.678
No shit.

01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:32.248
No this is different.

01:18:34.313 --> 01:18:38.113
They did something to
him, he's a puppet.

01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:43.113
Once he's dead, we will
finish what we started.

01:19:31.276 --> 01:19:32.840
They're controlling you!

01:19:32.842 --> 01:19:34.042
You can fight this.

01:19:39.708 --> 01:19:42.372
Just kill me.

01:19:42.374 --> 01:19:47.341
I'm sorry.

01:19:48.474 --> 01:19:49.407
Bro, did that
really just happen?

01:19:56.673 --> 01:19:58.271
Yeah.

01:19:58.273 --> 01:20:00.173
That was awesome.

01:20:28.137 --> 01:20:31.568
Can't you see, its
not how strong you are,

01:20:31.570 --> 01:20:36.303
it's about how you
use your power.

01:20:59.034 --> 01:21:01.401
There I win!

01:21:02.734 --> 01:21:06.300
Nyx Moros where are you?

01:21:23.298 --> 01:21:24.799
This is my show.

01:21:54.196 --> 01:21:55.094
What's going on here?

01:21:55.096 --> 01:21:57.330
Geeze, sir, I uh...

01:22:00.462 --> 01:22:01.296
Did she win?

01:22:04.262 --> 01:22:05.893
Yeah, yeah she did.

01:22:05.895 --> 01:22:08.062
I've been rooting for
her the whole time.

01:22:09.329 --> 01:22:10.392
You watch this?

01:22:10.394 --> 01:22:11.794
Yeah, who doesn't?

01:22:13.361 --> 01:22:14.395
Send me in.

01:22:18.027 --> 01:22:19.760
Prepare for the final battle.

01:22:20.827 --> 01:22:23.791
Oh and can you have a
round of those drinks

01:22:23.793 --> 01:22:26.059
for our guests in the
executive chamber?

01:22:26.061 --> 01:22:26.827
Yes sir.

01:22:27.595 --> 01:22:28.893
Thank you.

01:22:34.559 --> 01:22:35.758
Come on, what is this?

01:24:24.016 --> 01:24:27.050
Awe She did put
up a good fight.

01:24:38.849 --> 01:24:40.714
That's it push it.

01:24:42.548 --> 01:24:44.216
Give it all you got.

01:24:45.715 --> 01:24:47.914
I'm going to kill you.

01:26:28.638 --> 01:26:29.672
Jankins?

01:26:30.705 --> 01:26:33.703
What the hell are you doing?

01:26:33.705 --> 01:26:35.735
It's sad that
you don't see it.

01:26:35.737 --> 01:26:38.937
That power you have pointing
at me this very second.

01:26:38.939 --> 01:26:42.802
