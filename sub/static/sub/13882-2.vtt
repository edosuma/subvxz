01:03.760 --> 01:07.355
This is an SOS distress call
from the mining ship "Red Dwarf",

01:07.440 --> 01:10.477
The crew are dead, killed by a radiation leak,

01:10.560 --> 01:12.516
The only survivors were; Dave Lister,

01:12.600 --> 01:15.194
who was in suspended animation
during the disaster,

01:15.280 --> 01:18.113
and his pregnant cat,
who was safely sealed in the hold,

01:18.200 --> 01:20.395
Revived three million years later,

01:20.480 --> 01:24.075
his only companions
are a life form who evolved from his cat

01:24.160 --> 01:26.674
and Arnold Rimmer - a hologram
simulation of one of the dead crew,

01:29.400 --> 01:33.029
I am Holly, the ship's computer,
with an IQ of 6,000-

01:33.120 --> 01:35.873
the same IQ as 6,000 PE teachers,

01:37.800 --> 01:41.759
# I n a crater, on a ast'roid
excavati ng for a mine,

01:41.840 --> 01:46.391
# Lived an old plutonium miner,
and his daughter Clementine #

01:46.800 --> 01:51.351
- Lister. RD 52169.
- Yeth? Can I help you?

01:52.080 --> 01:54.196
- You've got a lisp.
- Yeth, I know,

01:54.440 --> 01:58.638
The malfunction has been reported,
Thorry for the inconvenienth,

01:58.720 --> 02:02.269
Give me a bacon sandwich
with French mustard and black coffee.

02:05.200 --> 02:07.998
Your vocabulary unit's not working either.

02:08.080 --> 02:12.835
Thith altho hath been reported,
Thorry for the inconvenienth,

02:12.920 --> 02:16.959
- Can you just try a black coffee?
- I'll certainly try,

02:21.600 --> 02:23.875
- That's a bucket.
- Thorry,

02:24.240 --> 02:26.800
# Do, do, do, da da... # Morning, Lister.

02:26.880 --> 02:30.759
How's life, you pregnant
baboon-bellied space beatnik?

02:30.840 --> 02:33.274
What's the plan for today, then?

02:33.360 --> 02:35.794
Slobbing in the morning,
then slobbing in the afternoon,

02:35.880 --> 02:38.758
then a snooze before the main evening slob?

02:38.840 --> 02:41.479
You're a disgrace to the species.

02:44.840 --> 02:46.990
Good morning, Rimmer.

02:48.280 --> 02:53.593
Clock stop! 6.47.
Not a bad little time for the mile.

02:54.080 --> 02:56.913
Pity I was only doing the 300 metres.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.232
I had that conversation with Lister.
Knock... 4 minutes off for that.

03:01.320 --> 03:05.552
Plus a little rest, so I wouldn't
looked shagged out as I passed him.

03:05.640 --> 03:09.315
So, knock that off
and... I've broken the world record, well done.

03:09.400 --> 03:12.073
I'm fitter than I thought.
Holly, give me a clean uniform.

03:12.160 --> 03:16.392
- 9,47 am, Arnold,
- No, a clean uniform, you idiot.

03:16.560 --> 03:19.597
- I'm rather busy at the moment,
- Now!

03:23.520 --> 03:28.310
And give me a crewcut.
I'm beginning to look like a Hell's Angel.

03:28.840 --> 03:32.196
We're going to hit light speed in 24 hours,

03:32.280 --> 03:34.840
I have to navigate a ship the size of a city

03:34.920 --> 03:38.674
through speeds never
experienced in the human sphere,

03:38.840 --> 03:43.391
I'm not a combination of the Speaking
Clock, Moss Bros and Teasy-Weasy,

03:43.920 --> 03:46.388
Holly, a hologram I may be.

03:46.480 --> 03:49.756
But I'm sti ll the highest ranking
technician aboard this ship.

03:49.840 --> 03:52.070
If I say do something, you do it.

03:52.160 --> 03:55.357
Understand? You stupid, jumped-up filofax.

03:55.440 --> 03:57.715
- I'm a what?
- You heard.

03:58.080 --> 04:02.073
- Just get on with it. Very short.
- OK, Arnold,

04:05.000 --> 04:07.594
- Have you done it, Hol?
- Yes,

04:07.680 --> 04:10.877
- A crewcut, and it's very short?
- Yes, Arnold,

04:10.960 --> 04:14.270
As my father always said, shiny clean boots

04:14.360 --> 04:17.670
and a spanking short haircut,
and you can cope with anything.

04:17.760 --> 04:21.435
He said that just before all that
unfortunate suicide business.

04:26.720 --> 04:30.269
Ah, now that's me with Jim Bexley Speed.

04:30.360 --> 04:33.238
He played for the London Jets
Zero Gravity Football Team.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.550
He was roof attack.

04:35.720 --> 04:39.553
He was really, really, really,
really thrilled to meet me.

04:40.560 --> 04:43.472
- Who's that guy?
- That's me grandmother.

04:43.560 --> 04:46.472
She brought me up. She was a great old lady.

04:46.640 --> 04:50.713
She got me expelled from school
because she nutted the headmaster.

04:50.960 --> 04:53.030
Wow. That's nice.

04:53.120 --> 04:55.395
It's just a Jupiter rise. Everyone takes that shot.

04:57.480 --> 04:59.869
Who is that?

04:59.960 --> 05:02.076
That's me Dad. It's me only photo.

05:02.160 --> 05:05.232
He's your father? No wonder you're so ugly.

05:05.400 --> 05:08.836
- No, that's his dog, Hannah.
- Dawwg? What's a dawwg?

05:08.920 --> 05:11.354
- It's just a pet.
- Ugleeeeee!

05:11.520 --> 05:16.071
You go get your stuff and let me pack mine.
Will you do that?

05:16.280 --> 05:21.673
This... dog. Better not be around here
or I may have to chase him.

05:21.840 --> 05:24.673
Oh, yeah. Do you know how big they are?

05:24.760 --> 05:29.436
They're about 18 feet long
with teeth as big as your leg.

05:29.600 --> 05:32.478
Oh, yes, well, I may have to chase him anyway.

05:32.560 --> 05:34.312
Aaaaaw!

05:36.880 --> 05:40.589
Oh, Lennon! Look what's happened to McCartney.

05:55.800 --> 05:57.836
So, mechanical engineering!

05:59.080 --> 06:01.548
Hey! Perfection!

06:01.640 --> 06:03.870
And they said you was a waste of money.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.229
- What's he looking at?
- Who?

06:16.320 --> 06:18.709
That idiotic cat.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.356
- What have you done to your hair?
- Holly did it.

06:25.440 --> 06:27.829
- Why?
- I ordered him to.

06:27.920 --> 06:31.037
- It looks ridiculous.
- It may look ridiculous to you,

06:31.120 --> 06:33.873
but I like it like this. I feel like a man.

06:35.080 --> 06:37.958
Yeah. And you'll probably
get one, looking like that.

06:38.800 --> 06:43.237
Short hair gives a man
a sense of dignity, a sense of discipline.

06:43.320 --> 06:46.392
- Have you seen it?
- I don't need to see it.

06:46.480 --> 06:48.391
I didn't get it to look good.

06:48.480 --> 06:52.029
This is a haircut for action,
not poncing around in.

06:52.120 --> 06:55.908
Maybe a bit severe. A bit too Green Beret.

06:58.240 --> 07:04.031
But you are how you look, and I look...
like a complete and total tit!

07:06.560 --> 07:08.391
Holly! Holly!

07:08.560 --> 07:11.950
This is a recording, Holly is busy at the moment,

07:12.120 --> 07:15.715
Leave a message after the bleep
and he'll get back to you,

07:15.880 --> 07:17.598
Bleep,

07:17.760 --> 07:21.435
Holly, this is Rimmer. Remember me? Rimmer.

07:21.520 --> 07:25.718
Arnold Rimmer. The poor goit
you made look like Helen Shapiro.

07:25.800 --> 07:28.758
I'll see you toast in the fires of Hell for this.

07:28.920 --> 07:31.309
Did someone say they wanted toast?

07:31.400 --> 07:33.709
No, shut up.

07:33.800 --> 07:37.349
- What are you doing?
- I'm going into stasis. Holly tell you?

07:37.440 --> 07:39.158
Stasis? What for?

07:39.240 --> 07:41.356
While we go through light speed.

07:41.440 --> 07:44.557
I thought I may as well stay
till we get back to Earth.

07:44.720 --> 07:46.995
Earth? That's three million years away.

07:47.080 --> 07:49.913
You can't leave me that long - I'll go peculiar.

07:52.680 --> 07:56.036
Holly, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.

07:56.120 --> 07:58.236
Can I please have my own hair back?

07:58.320 --> 08:02.996
- Pretty please, with sugar on?
- I'll think about it, Arnold,

08:05.160 --> 08:08.232
Holly's supposed to have told you.
I thought you didn't mind.

08:08.320 --> 08:10.914
Mind? Mind? Why should I mind?

08:11.000 --> 08:14.470
3,000 millennia alone,
while you're in suspended animation?

08:14.560 --> 08:17.950
I'll do that crossword book -
that should kill a couple of centuries.

08:18.120 --> 08:20.156
Holly'll switch you off till we come out.

08:20.240 --> 08:24.472
Switch me on, switch me off,
like a battery-powered sex aid.

08:24.720 --> 08:27.188
- Don't give me this.
- Give you what?

08:27.280 --> 08:29.874
I'm dead, or haven't you noticed?

08:30.040 --> 08:32.270
I know you're dead. Don't whinge on.

08:32.440 --> 08:34.270
Sorry to be a bore.

08:34.440 --> 08:37.636
You're everything you were when you were alive.

08:37.720 --> 08:40.438
Same personality, same everything.

08:40.600 --> 08:43.159
Apart from the detail that I'm a stiffy.

08:44.200 --> 08:47.272
Death isn't the handicap it was in the olden days.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.510
It doesn't screw your career like it used to.

08:49.680 --> 08:52.399
But if you had two people coming for a job

08:52.480 --> 08:54.914
and one was dead, which would you pick?

08:55.520 --> 08:58.557
Well, depends on which was best qualified.

08:58.720 --> 09:02.076
Bullpats. When did you last
see a dead newsreader?

09:03.240 --> 09:05.959
Channel 27 had a hologram reading the news.

09:06.120 --> 09:09.954
Oh... groovy, funky Channel 27.

09:10.040 --> 09:13.715
Big smegging deal. You livies hate us deadies.

09:13.920 --> 09:17.674
If I'm going back to Earth,
I have to go into stasis.

09:17.760 --> 09:21.355
It's gonna take 4,000 years just to turn around.

09:21.440 --> 09:24.637
You can't do a three-point turn
this close to light speed.

09:25.080 --> 09:28.550
Really? Read that in the Ladybird
Book of Astronavigation?

09:28.720 --> 09:31.109
It happens to be true.

09:31.280 --> 09:35.478
I know. I've taken
the astronavigation exam nine times.

09:35.560 --> 09:37.630
Ten, counting the time I had my spasm.

09:37.840 --> 09:41.833
You'll only be turned off till we get back to Earth.

09:41.920 --> 09:44.480
Where you won't need me,
so I won't get switched back on.

09:44.680 --> 09:49.276
They may cure you. They may have
made advances while we were away.

09:49.440 --> 09:53.194
I expect they cured death
the instant we left Earth.

09:53.280 --> 09:56.352
I expect doctors' surgeries
are packed with the dead.

09:56.440 --> 09:59.432
"Mrs Johnstone, take one
of these three times a day,

09:59.520 --> 10:02.717
"you'll soon be living again.
Carole, next corpse, please. "

10:03.360 --> 10:06.557
- They might.
- Yes, if the Earth hasn't blown up.

10:06.720 --> 10:08.711
Or the ants haven't taken over.

10:08.880 --> 10:13.590
Well, you'll be in your element.
You'll get a decent job at last.

10:13.760 --> 10:16.149
- Yeah, yeah.
- You'll run for government.

10:16.240 --> 10:19.789
- Yeah, yeah.
- You'll even make it as a male model.

10:22.600 --> 10:23.999
Git.

10:34.760 --> 10:38.070
# To Ganymede and Titan

10:41.200 --> 10:44.510
# Yes, sir, I've been around.

10:44.600 --> 10:49.549
# But there ain't no place
in the whole of... space

10:49.640 --> 10:53.519
# Like that good ol' toddlin' town...

10:53.680 --> 10:55.989
# Oh, oohh...

10:56.080 --> 10:58.275
# Lunar City... #

11:10.960 --> 11:13.554
# Lunar City 7... #

11:13.720 --> 11:15.711
You can't sing, you know,

11:16.080 --> 11:20.119
- You can, can you?
- As a toaster, I'm tone deaf, am I?

11:20.200 --> 11:22.270
Go on, then.

11:22.360 --> 11:24.510
Welcome to the Starlight Ballroom...

11:24.600 --> 11:29.037
# Fly me to the moon and let me... #

11:29.920 --> 11:31.831
# Lunar City 7... #

11:41.160 --> 11:45.870
- What was that?!
- Er, 11, 14 ship time, Dave,

11:45.960 --> 11:48.474
No, Holly, what was that flash?

11:48.560 --> 11:51.438
We've broken the light barrier 22 hours early,

11:51.520 --> 11:53.590
Is everyone all right?

11:53.680 --> 11:55.989
I can't do it, I can't cope,

11:56.080 --> 11:58.230
Me bottle's gone,

11:59.040 --> 12:01.918
Holly, is everyone all right?

12:02.200 --> 12:05.476
No, I'm not, I thought
I could navigate at light speed

12:05.560 --> 12:07.915
but I can't wrap me head round it,

12:08.480 --> 12:10.948
Gordon Bennet, that was a close one!

12:11.240 --> 12:14.949
What's the problem? You've an IQ of 6,000!

12:15.200 --> 12:18.033
We're travelling faster than the speed of light,

12:18.120 --> 12:21.157
By the time we see something,
we've already passed through it,

12:21.240 --> 12:24.630
Even with an IQ of 6,000,
it's still brown trousers time,

12:26.480 --> 12:28.277
Can I help?

12:28.440 --> 12:31.238
It's all right, I'm getting the hang of it now,

12:31.320 --> 12:34.232
Left a bit... straighten her up, I better go,

12:36.760 --> 12:40.230
# To Ganymede and Titan,
Yes, sir, I've... #

12:43.160 --> 12:45.276
Rimmer! Rimmer!

12:57.920 --> 13:01.708
# To Ganymede and Titan,
Yes, sir, I've been... #

13:02.880 --> 13:05.348
Rimmer!

13:05.760 --> 13:07.716
What? What is it?

13:08.160 --> 13:11.072
Do you see anything really weird in that mirror?

13:13.360 --> 13:15.396
Yes. You, you ugly goit.

13:15.480 --> 13:19.359
- No. It was really odd.
- What was?

13:19.440 --> 13:22.113
Nothing. Forget it, doesn't matter.

13:22.200 --> 13:25.317
- What doesn't matter?
- Nothing, forget it.

13:26.600 --> 13:29.068
Have you been at the marijuana gin?

13:29.160 --> 13:31.151
Forget it. It doesn't matter.

13:31.240 --> 13:33.879
Fine. If you have more problems with nothing

13:33.960 --> 13:36.872
and things that don't matter,
just scream my name hysterically,

13:36.960 --> 13:39.349
and I'll come pelting down the corridor!

13:45.200 --> 13:47.794
# This little kitty went to space...

13:47.880 --> 13:50.678
# This little kitty stayed at home

13:50.760 --> 13:52.990
# Ooohh, aaaahh, tcheee...

13:53.080 --> 13:56.231
- # My clothes are... #
- What are you doing?

13:56.320 --> 13:58.356
What you said, dude.

13:58.440 --> 14:02.672
I said take a few essentials
that you couldn't bear to leave.

14:02.760 --> 14:04.876
Right. These are all I'm taking.

14:04.960 --> 14:09.397
These and the other ten racks.
Travel light, move fast.

14:09.480 --> 14:11.835
You can't take it all. There's no room.

14:12.280 --> 14:16.114
OK. I'll leave... this.

14:16.800 --> 14:18.995
I'll just have to do without it.

14:20.480 --> 14:23.358
- You can take two suits, that's it.
- Two suits?

14:23.440 --> 14:25.431
- Then I'm staying.
- You can't stay.

14:25.520 --> 14:28.796
- When I come out, you'll be dead.
- Two suits IS dead.

14:29.640 --> 14:33.315
If I cut off my leg and leave it behind,
can I take three?

14:34.680 --> 14:36.671
Going into stasis in 10 minutes,
meet you in the sleeping quarters.

14:39.280 --> 14:42.078
- Rimmer, I've been thinking.
- What?

14:42.160 --> 14:45.357
- About going into stasis.
- How did I do what?

14:48.800 --> 14:51.075
What do you mean, "How did I do what?"

14:51.160 --> 14:54.232
- Lister, don't be a gimboid.
- I'm not being a gimboid.

14:58.320 --> 15:00.993
I've been in the library, thinking. I've decided...

15:01.080 --> 15:03.196
Shut up.

15:03.720 --> 15:06.837
As I was saying
before I was so rudely interrupted,

15:06.920 --> 15:10.833
I've decided when you go into stasis
I want to be left behind.

15:10.920 --> 15:13.388
On your own, for the rest of your life?

15:13.480 --> 15:15.550
- What things?
- Eh?

15:16.640 --> 15:19.108
- I said, what?
- What's going on?

15:19.880 --> 15:22.269
- You are space crazy.
- I'M space crazy?!

15:22.360 --> 15:25.750
You're the one who's... space crazy.

15:25.840 --> 15:28.991
It probably is déja-vu. It sounds like it.

15:36.000 --> 15:40.710
Aaaagh! Rimmer, I've just seen you
walk out of that door.

15:40.800 --> 15:43.268
- What?
- How did you do that?

15:43.440 --> 15:46.876
- How did I do what?
- You just walked out of that door.

15:46.960 --> 15:48.951
Lister, don't be a gimboid.

15:49.040 --> 15:53.591
I swear, as you walked out
that door, you came in this one.

15:54.280 --> 15:56.271
I've been in the library, and I've decided...

15:56.360 --> 15:58.510
- I'm telling you...
- Shut up.

15:58.600 --> 16:01.239
As I was saying
before I was so rudely interrupted,

16:01.320 --> 16:04.676
when you go into stasis
I want to be left behind.

16:04.760 --> 16:07.274
You just came in and said exactly that.

16:07.360 --> 16:09.191
- What?
- You said that.

16:09.280 --> 16:11.350
- What?
- And that. You said that.

16:11.440 --> 16:14.318
- You are space crazy.
- And then you said...

16:14.400 --> 16:16.277
"It probably is déja-vu. "

16:16.360 --> 16:19.079
It probably is déja-vu. It sounds like it.

16:20.160 --> 16:22.720
Go on, then: shake your head and walk out.

16:27.480 --> 16:29.869
Rimmer, listen. Will you just listen?

16:29.960 --> 16:32.155
My tooth! I think I lost my tooth!

16:32.240 --> 16:34.435
Cat, wait. Rimmer, listen.

16:34.640 --> 16:37.757
I'm gonna eat the little fishies.

16:37.840 --> 16:40.479
I'm gonna... oh-oh... ah-ha!

16:40.560 --> 16:44.553
I was just making sure your fish were OK.
I wasn't going to eat them.

16:45.400 --> 16:49.075
- He just walked past us.
- Must be the light speed.

16:49.160 --> 16:51.720
- Holly, what's going on?
- It's light speed, I bet.

16:51.800 --> 16:54.234
- Is your name Holly?
- "Is your name Holly"

16:54.320 --> 16:56.356
Holly, what is going on?

16:56.520 --> 17:01.196
I'm a 10th generation Al hologramic computer,
I'm not your mum,

17:01.280 --> 17:03.635
Yes, fantastic.

17:03.800 --> 17:05.869
Do you want a hand with your homework,

17:05.960 --> 17:08.997
or me to sew little nametags in your PE kit?

17:09.640 --> 17:15.192
Holly, watch my li ps. What is hap- pen- ing?

17:15.280 --> 17:17.349
With the mirror, the cat, everything...

17:17.520 --> 17:21.308
You're seeing future echoes, Didn't I explain?

17:21.520 --> 17:23.714
What are future echoes?

17:23.800 --> 17:26.678
- How simple do you want this?
- So Lister can understand it.

17:26.839 --> 17:29.593
Ohh, Oh, dear,

17:29.760 --> 17:31.751
Difficult, I know.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.991
We're travelling faster than L,S, Right?

17:34.080 --> 17:36.071
- What's L.S.?
- Light Speed,

17:36.160 --> 17:37.798
- Smartarse.

17:37.960 --> 17:42.192
It's catching up with things you're to do
before you've done them,

17:42.280 --> 17:45.431
- We're seeing bits of the future?
- Yes,

17:45.520 --> 17:48.592
Told you it was light speed.
You should've asked me.

17:48.680 --> 17:52.195
- Can they see us?
- Of course not, Use your loaf,

17:52.360 --> 17:56.797
Wait. So the Cat's gonna break
his tooth some time in the future?

17:56.880 --> 17:59.155
I didn't think you wanted it THIS simple,

17:59.320 --> 18:01.629
Ain't nobody gonna break my tooth.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.836
How long is this going to last?

18:03.920 --> 18:07.469
Till the reverse thrust takes effect
and we drop below light speed,

18:07.560 --> 18:10.950
- What's that photograph?
- Me and Frankenstein, isn't it?

18:11.040 --> 18:16.114
- No. The one with the babies.
- Babies? I've never seen it before.

18:16.320 --> 18:19.153
Holly, is this what you call a future echo?

18:19.680 --> 18:22.797
Yes, of course it is! Bozo,

18:24.120 --> 18:28.079
Two babies. How did I get two babies?

18:32.000 --> 18:35.834
# Ganymede and Titan,
Yes, sir, I've been around

18:35.920 --> 18:37.797
# But there ain't no place
in the whole of space #

18:37.880 --> 18:39.996
What's this, guys?

18:40.760 --> 18:45.038
"Don't go into stasis.
Please don't leave us with Rimmer. "

18:46.120 --> 18:48.680
I'm sorry, guys, I've got to. We need you.

18:48.880 --> 18:51.394
There's nothing for me here.
I want to go back to Earth.

18:51.480 --> 18:55.598
Don't do that. I don't care what it's like.
It must be better than this.

18:55.680 --> 19:00.515
The dolphins may be in charge
of people in a human being-atarium.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.591
I just want to find out.

19:02.680 --> 19:05.558
What was that?!

19:18.240 --> 19:21.312
- What was that?
- Brace yourself for a shock.

19:21.400 --> 19:23.391
- I just saw you die.
- What?

19:23.480 --> 19:25.471
I did warn you to brace yourself.

19:25.720 --> 19:28.757
- You didn't give me a chance.
- I gave you ample bracing time.

19:28.840 --> 19:30.990
You didn't... you didn't even pause.

19:31.160 --> 19:33.913
I'm sorry. I've just had a rather nasty experience.

19:34.040 --> 19:39.114
I've just seen someone I know
die in the most hideous way!

19:40.000 --> 19:43.037
- Yeah, me!
- You were fiddling with a navicomp...

19:43.120 --> 19:45.554
I don't wanna know. I don't wanna know.

19:45.720 --> 19:49.110
- You don't want to know?
- No! Was it quick?

19:49.560 --> 19:52.552
Well, I wouldn't say it was super-fast.

19:52.640 --> 19:56.679
Not if you count the thrashing around
and agonised squealing.

19:56.760 --> 20:01.197
- You're loving this, aren't you?
- What a horrible thing to say.

20:01.360 --> 20:03.430
- It was definitely me?
- Oh, yes.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.830
I don't wanna know.

20:05.920 --> 20:07.956
- How old did I look?
- How old are you now?

20:08.120 --> 20:11.590
- 25. How old did I look?
- Mid-twenties.

20:11.680 --> 20:15.719
Smeg! I'm not ready.
I'm not smegging ready!

20:15.880 --> 20:17.518
You did seem surprised.

20:18.840 --> 20:21.229
Did you actually see me face?

20:21.400 --> 20:23.789
You were wearing a hat, but it was you.

20:23.960 --> 20:26.918
I won't wear a hat and it can't happen. Can it?

20:27.040 --> 20:30.077
- I can live without a hat.
- Lister, it has happened.

20:30.160 --> 20:32.993
You can't change it any more
than change what you had for breakfast.

20:33.160 --> 20:36.948
It hasn't happened. It has will
have going to have happened,

20:37.040 --> 20:41.397
happened but it hasn't actually
happened, happened yet, actually.

20:41.600 --> 20:45.673
Poppycock. It will be happened,
it shall be going to be happening,

20:45.760 --> 20:49.594
it will be wasn't, could -
will have been taken place in the future.

20:49.680 --> 20:52.911
Simple as that. You bucket's been kicked, baby.

20:53.920 --> 20:58.038
- Says you.
- Says me and Albert Einstein.

20:58.120 --> 21:00.475
Albo and I agree on this one -

21:00.560 --> 21:02.471
the Theory of Relativity.

21:02.640 --> 21:04.631
All right. OK. OK.

21:05.120 --> 21:09.557
Right. The Cat broke his tooth
in a future echo, right?

21:09.640 --> 21:12.279
- If I can stop him...
- Can't be done.

21:12.360 --> 21:15.079
- I can stop me from dying.
- Can't be done.

21:15.160 --> 21:17.151
How would a cat break his tooth?

21:17.240 --> 21:22.758
By eating something... hard.

21:24.200 --> 21:27.237
My robot goldfish! Eating my robot goldfish.

21:27.320 --> 21:30.357
- Holly, where's the Cat?
- Going into your sleeping quarters,

21:30.440 --> 21:32.431
Oh, Smegging Hell!

21:34.360 --> 21:37.557
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm back. Feeling good.

21:38.840 --> 21:40.990
How am I looking?

21:43.960 --> 21:46.110
Go-oo-od.

21:46.200 --> 21:49.033
I wish I was someone else, then I could kiss me.

21:49.600 --> 21:52.751
I think I'll investigate... these!

21:53.840 --> 21:57.037
No. I just ate. Well, one little fishy...

21:57.120 --> 22:00.351
# Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna eat you,
little fishy...

22:00.440 --> 22:03.477
# I'm gonna eat you, little fishy #

22:03.560 --> 22:06.393
Oh-eeh-oh...

22:06.480 --> 22:09.074
Yeah, I got you!

22:09.160 --> 22:11.151
I'm gonna... errgh.

22:13.480 --> 22:16.517
I got the fish, I'm not gonna die.
I'm not gonna die.

22:16.600 --> 22:18.795
Crazy monkey! You creased my suit.

22:18.880 --> 22:23.556
My tooth! My tooth! I think I've lost my tooth.

22:27.480 --> 22:31.792
Lister, allow me to be the first
to offer my commiserations.

22:33.960 --> 22:36.554
You're really loving this, aren't ya?

22:36.880 --> 22:40.111
"Death isn't the handicap
it used to be in the olden days"!

22:40.200 --> 22:43.272
"It doesn't screw your career up
in the way it used to"!

22:43.360 --> 22:46.432
Right. There's always some good
in every situation.

22:46.520 --> 22:51.514
Absolutely. You are about to do
the largest splits in your life.

22:51.800 --> 22:54.792
- I get blown up, then?
- Bits of you do.

22:56.040 --> 23:00.318
It's not fair. There's loads of things
I've never done.

23:00.920 --> 23:03.832
Like... I've never had a prawn vindaloo.

23:04.480 --> 23:07.438
And I've never read... a book.

23:08.440 --> 23:10.670
And I wanted to have a family.

23:10.760 --> 23:15.072
And loads of practise on the things
you've to do to get a family.

23:16.480 --> 23:21.395
Holly, I'd like to send
an internal memo. Black border.

23:21.480 --> 23:24.153
Begins: "To Dave Lister,

23:24.240 --> 23:26.834
"condolences on your passing away. "

23:26.920 --> 23:30.629
What's that poem? "Now, weary traveller,

23:30.720 --> 23:35.316
"rest your head, for just like me,
you're utterly dead. "

23:36.280 --> 23:40.353
Emergency, Emergency,
There's an emergency going on,

23:40.520 --> 23:43.751
- What is it, Hol?
- There's an emergency, Dave,

23:43.840 --> 23:47.594
The navicomp's overheating,
I need your help in the Drive Room,

23:47.680 --> 23:51.468
- Oooh-ooh-ooh.
- Come in 169, your time is up.

23:51.880 --> 23:55.589
- OK. What was I wearing?
- That jacket and red Tee shirt.

23:58.120 --> 24:02.636
You said yourself I can't stop it.
Let's get it over with.

24:02.720 --> 24:04.836
Lister, what's that for?

24:05.040 --> 24:07.873
I'm going out as I came in,
screaming and kicking.

24:07.960 --> 24:10.155
You can't whack Death on the head.

24:10.800 --> 24:13.712
If he comes near me,
I'm gonna rip his nipples off.

24:27.480 --> 24:30.597
It can't cope with the influx
of data at light speed, Dave,

24:30.680 --> 24:33.194
Hook it up to the drive computer for me?

24:49.160 --> 24:51.879
Six...

24:51.960 --> 24:54.110
Five...

24:57.280 --> 24:59.316
Four...

24:59.720 --> 25:01.711
Three...

25:04.800 --> 25:06.791
Two...

25:07.080 --> 25:10.789
Aaaaaaaaaah! One...

25:12.760 --> 25:15.752
I did it! I'm not going to die.

25:15.840 --> 25:19.389
- Aaaaaaaaaah!
- Aaaaaaaah. Dog attack.

25:26.720 --> 25:29.314
- Why are you so chirpy.
- I'm alive.

25:29.400 --> 25:31.709
For how long? It may happen tomorrow.

25:31.800 --> 25:34.997
- Maybe it won't happen at all.
- I saw it. I'm sure it was you.

25:38.640 --> 25:42.758
Hello, Dave. This is me. I mean you.

25:42.840 --> 25:48.153
I mean, I am you. This is you aged 171, Dave.

25:48.240 --> 25:52.153
I know you're there,
because when I was your age,

25:52.240 --> 25:56.597
I saw me at my age telling you
what I'm about to tell you,

25:57.400 --> 26:00.710
and you've got to tell you,
when you get to be me.

26:01.240 --> 26:04.471
- I'm glad you've got your marbles.
- Shhhhh!

26:04.640 --> 26:07.279
I've got to tell you about Bexley.

26:07.480 --> 26:10.790
- Who's Bexley?
- I wanted to call my second son "Bexley",

26:10.880 --> 26:13.474
- after Jim Bexley Speed.
- Your second son?

26:13.560 --> 26:16.677
- What about your first son?
- Jim! After Jim Bexley Speed.

26:16.840 --> 26:20.469
It wasn't you Rimmer saw
in the Drive Room, it was Bexley.

26:20.640 --> 26:22.596
Rimmer, you saw me son die!

26:23.080 --> 26:26.356
Never mind this tott! What about me, old man?

26:26.440 --> 26:29.557
What happens to me? Do I become an officer?

26:29.640 --> 26:31.949
I'm to have two sons! Fantastic.

26:32.040 --> 26:34.315
- But one dies.
- Everybody dies.

26:34.400 --> 26:38.552
You're born, you die. The middle bit
is "life", and that's still to come.

26:38.720 --> 26:41.473
Get your camera. You haven't much time.

26:41.640 --> 26:44.871
Get your camera
and run to the medical unit. Run!

26:46.560 --> 26:48.755
What about me? What happens?

26:48.880 --> 26:51.314
He can't hear us, he's from the future.

26:51.400 --> 26:54.392
Ah, if I ask you now, you can remember it,

26:54.480 --> 26:56.675
and when you're him, and you can tell me.

26:56.760 --> 26:58.398
Boss thinking!

26:59.240 --> 27:02.312
Rimmer, you wanted to know
what happened to you.

27:02.400 --> 27:07.269
- Come closer, come closer still.
- Yes. Yes.

27:07.360 --> 27:10.193
- Heh, heh, heh.
- You goit.

27:10.600 --> 27:15.390
No, you goit. I'm surrounded by goits.
Holly, you're a goit.

27:15.560 --> 27:17.551
- I'm a what?
- You heard!

27:17.720 --> 27:21.554
What's happening, Hol?
Are we going to see my funeral?

27:21.640 --> 27:26.395
The faster we go, the more into the future
the future echoes are,

27:26.480 --> 27:28.994
And now, since we've started to slow down,

27:29.080 --> 27:32.117
the future echoes are nearer to the present,
Clear?

27:32.200 --> 27:34.555
- No.
- Tough,

27:38.280 --> 27:42.432
Wait a mi nute. I don't understand
how you're supposed to get two sons,

27:42.520 --> 27:45.318
- without a woman on the ship.
- Neither do I.

27:45.400 --> 27:47.675
It'll be a laugh finding out.

27:49.080 --> 27:51.992
I can't see you, but I know you can see me.

27:52.080 --> 27:54.116
I'd like you to meet your two sons.

27:54.200 --> 27:58.512
This is Jim and this is Bexley.
Stop crying and say "cheese", boys.

28:02.160 --> 28:06.597
# It's cold outside
There's no kind of atmosphere.

28:06.680 --> 28:09.797
# I'm all alone, more or less

28:09.880 --> 28:12.872
