00:01.610 --> 00:03.525
-Previously onThis Is Us...
-SOPHIE: My ex-husband,

00:03.568 --> 00:05.309
who I haven't seen in 12 years,

00:05.353 --> 00:07.442
shows up at my doorstep
unannounced.

00:07.485 --> 00:10.097
What are you doing,lurking outside of my apartment?

00:10.140 --> 00:11.924
Can we go get a coffee?

00:11.968 --> 00:13.274
I'm engaged.

00:13.317 --> 00:14.275
YOUNG KEVIN:
I was supposed

00:14.318 --> 00:15.232
to end up in the Super Bowl,

00:15.276 --> 00:16.668
not watch it like you guys.

00:16.712 --> 00:18.279
What's your point, Kevin?

00:18.322 --> 00:19.976
I'm gonna go to Sophie's.

00:20.020 --> 00:23.501
-Best Pearson Super Bowl ever.
-REBECCA: Oh, my God!

00:23.545 --> 00:25.634
-JACK: I'm going downstairs.
-REBECCA: No, no, no, Jack,
Kevin's not here.

00:25.677 --> 00:27.940
He's not here.  He was with Sophie last night.

00:27.984 --> 00:30.682
KEVIN:
Man, it has been a day,
I'm telling you.

00:30.726 --> 00:32.336
Probably my fault, though.
You know, I mean,

00:32.380 --> 00:34.208
I keep putting myself in these
obviously terrible situations

00:34.251 --> 00:36.253
because I'm so desperate
to have this crazy

00:36.297 --> 00:38.212
love story
like what my parents had.

00:38.255 --> 00:40.431
But maybe it's just not
in the cards for me.

00:40.475 --> 00:42.346
Here.

00:42.390 --> 00:43.782
You take that.
I got to concentrate.

00:47.699 --> 00:50.311
I can't sleep.

00:53.705 --> 00:55.490
You can't sleep, huh?

00:55.533 --> 00:58.014
What's wrong, bud,
why can't you sleep?

00:59.276 --> 01:02.192
-I miss my sheep.
-Your sheep?

01:02.236 --> 01:03.976
Oh.

01:04.020 --> 01:06.501
You mean, like, the mobile
that hangs above your crib?

01:06.544 --> 01:08.764
Those sheep?

01:08.807 --> 01:11.767
Bud, I-I don't know
what Mommy did with those,

01:11.810 --> 01:16.598
and Mommy's not awake right now,so, um, hey.

01:16.641 --> 01:19.035
What noise does-does
a sheep make?

01:20.080 --> 01:22.256
-Bah.
-Bah?

01:22.299 --> 01:25.215
Come on, you can do better
than that.

01:25.259 --> 01:27.478
-How about, how about
if we try calling the sheep?

01:27.522 --> 01:28.479
Maybe they'll come to us, huh?

01:34.181 --> 01:37.184
Well, kiddo, if the sheep
aren't gonna come to us,

01:37.227 --> 01:39.360
maybe we got to go find them.

01:39.403 --> 01:41.753
Yeah.

01:41.797 --> 01:43.799
♪ I started out in search of♪

01:45.844 --> 01:47.846
♪ Ordinary things♪

01:50.414 --> 01:53.678
♪ I started telling the story♪

01:54.766 --> 01:57.291
♪ Without knowing the end.♪

02:00.424 --> 02:02.165
-Hey, uh...

02:03.558 --> 02:05.647
Hey, Kevin, you ready?
You in it?

02:05.690 --> 02:08.389
-Uh...
-You're not in it. What's up?

02:08.432 --> 02:11.740
Well, it's-it's-- look,it's this new ending, you know.

02:11.783 --> 02:14.177
Um, I don't want to step
on your toes, obviously.

02:14.221 --> 02:16.353
Oh-- look, this is
my dance space, all right?

02:16.397 --> 02:19.269
Cool-ass endings--
your dance space.

02:20.923 --> 02:23.055
It's Dirty Dancing.
I thought you'd be a fan of...

02:23.099 --> 02:24.056
-Oh, right, yeah.
-Remember?

02:24.100 --> 02:27.408
Wow, anyway, um,
look, I just, I just feel

02:27.451 --> 02:31.238
like there was real resolutionwith the scene we already shot.

02:32.369 --> 02:34.328
Oh, God. What am I doing?

02:34.371 --> 02:36.286
You're right.I shouldn't be questioning you.

02:36.330 --> 02:38.680
Obviously. Um, I'm sorry.
I had a hell of a day, man.

02:38.723 --> 02:41.422
And I'm... I'm sorry.

02:41.465 --> 02:43.337
Want to talk about it?

02:43.380 --> 02:45.121
Can I? So I go
on this date, right?

02:45.165 --> 02:47.471
It's amazing,
it's extraordinary.

02:47.515 --> 02:48.603
Anyway, it turns out
I'm her hall pass. Right?

02:48.646 --> 02:50.561
Kevin, you know what,
we're kinda on the clock here,

02:50.605 --> 02:53.434
and I'm getting the gist that
the date didn't go very well,

02:53.477 --> 02:55.000
so let me just get to the part

02:55.044 --> 02:56.611
where I build you
back up again, okay?

02:56.654 --> 02:59.831
-Yeah.
-All right, walk with me.

02:59.875 --> 03:02.921
Now, look, I can't fix
your love life,

03:02.965 --> 03:06.447
but I can help you understandmy philosophy on movie endings.

03:06.490 --> 03:07.883
KEVIN:
Okay.

03:09.885 --> 03:12.235
Hey, should I bring him
his phone?

03:12.279 --> 03:15.020
-Some Sophie keeps calling.
-I don't know.

03:15.064 --> 03:16.413
Can you get me another battery
for this, please?

03:16.457 --> 03:18.502
Uh, yeah, sure.

03:21.549 --> 03:24.291
-I don't know. That's...
-Trust me, Kevin.

03:24.334 --> 03:26.293
This is the ending
everyone wants.

03:26.336 --> 03:28.469
And they still
won't see it coming.

03:28.512 --> 03:30.819
-Huh.
-Um, Mr. Pearson, sir?

03:30.862 --> 03:32.255
-Yeah.
-Your phone keeps ringing.

03:32.299 --> 03:34.039
-Oh.
-She says it's important.

03:34.083 --> 03:35.824
-I didn't want to interrupt.
-NIGHT: Take it.

03:35.867 --> 03:37.391
-You sure?
-Definitely.

03:37.434 --> 03:39.784
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

03:44.789 --> 03:46.400
Hey. Soph, you okay?

03:46.443 --> 03:48.271
Everything all right?

03:48.315 --> 03:51.796
SOPHIE :
She's gone, Kev. My mom.

03:52.884 --> 03:54.451
What?

03:54.495 --> 03:56.714
She died yesterday.

03:59.587 --> 04:00.283
CLAIRE:
Kevin.

04:00.327 --> 04:02.720
-Hey, Claire.
-Hey.

04:02.764 --> 04:05.549
Thought you'd be watching
the Super Bowl with your dad.

04:05.593 --> 04:08.160
-No, we had a pretty bad fight.-Oh.

04:08.204 --> 04:09.510
Plus, I'm not really feeling
like watching the game

04:09.553 --> 04:10.772
-right now.
-Right.

04:10.815 --> 04:13.731
You still moping over that leg?

04:13.775 --> 04:15.777
Cheer up, kid.

04:15.820 --> 04:18.780
Football isn't
the be-all end-all.

04:18.823 --> 04:20.999
There are better things
ahead for you.

04:21.043 --> 04:24.133
I just know it. You hear me?

04:25.352 --> 04:26.744
-Hey.

04:26.788 --> 04:28.485
Where you guys headed?

04:28.529 --> 04:30.095
-Party in the woods.
-Yeah.

04:30.139 --> 04:31.314
Sounds good.

04:31.358 --> 04:33.142
-All right. See you later, Mom.-All right.
-Bye.

04:33.185 --> 04:34.317
Bye.

04:37.581 --> 04:39.931
Soph, I'm so sorry.

04:39.975 --> 04:42.456
It's weird
that I called, right?

04:42.499 --> 04:45.546
No. No, of course not.

04:45.589 --> 04:49.027
Grant-- you know, that's
my fiancé's name, Grant--

04:49.071 --> 04:52.596
he's, he's been really great  with all the logistical stuff,

04:52.640 --> 04:57.775
but, you know, both
his parents are s-still...

04:57.819 --> 05:00.604
Soph? Hey, okay, Soph,
I got one for you.

05:00.648 --> 05:01.779
I got one for you. You ready?

05:06.523 --> 05:08.482
Ready.

05:08.525 --> 05:14.009
He starts
a cider-brewing company

05:14.052 --> 05:16.446
and he calls it
"How do you like them apples?"

05:23.975 --> 05:26.369
Well done, Kevin. Thank you.

05:26.413 --> 05:28.371
Yeah.

05:29.459 --> 05:31.418
I should go.

05:31.461 --> 05:33.550
Hey, Soph?

05:34.595 --> 05:36.640
I'm really sorry.

05:38.903 --> 05:41.515
She was a force of nature.

05:41.558 --> 05:44.431
Yeah, she was.

05:44.474 --> 05:46.476
Thanks.

06:05.452 --> 06:07.802
SOPHIE:Kev, come on. We have to go in.

06:07.845 --> 06:10.326
-It's gonna be so annoying.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.632
It's your mom's
birthday weekend.

06:11.675 --> 06:13.329
And we haven't been homesince our weird wedding dinner.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.678
We're never here.

06:14.722 --> 06:15.592
She's gonna have
a million questions

06:15.636 --> 06:17.246
about my acting career.

06:17.289 --> 06:18.508
She's probably got
my headshot hung up

06:18.552 --> 06:19.770
like they do at the cleaners.

06:19.814 --> 06:23.644
Come on. It's her son's
first TV appearance.

06:23.687 --> 06:25.428
Let the woman revel.

06:25.472 --> 06:29.998
Come on. Please, I don't--I don't even know what I did...

06:30.041 --> 06:33.436
-"Ugh"? That's a nice hello.

06:33.480 --> 06:34.437
Hold on.

06:36.091 --> 06:37.353
Hey, Ma?

06:39.094 --> 06:41.923
Hi, guys.
You guys got here early.

06:41.966 --> 06:43.707
-Hi. What a surprise.

06:45.317 --> 06:46.797
-REBECCA: Hey, sweetheart.
-KEVIN: Hi.

06:46.841 --> 06:49.800
-What's Kate's problem?

06:49.844 --> 06:51.280
She's on the phone with Marc.

06:51.323 --> 06:52.673
-Hey, guys.
-Oh, she's still dating

06:52.716 --> 06:54.544
-that greaseball?
-REBECCA: I wasn't expecting

06:54.588 --> 06:57.025
-you guys until tomorrow.
-My class got canceled,

06:57.068 --> 06:59.070
so we just decided
to come early.

06:59.114 --> 07:01.029
-So happy birthday.
-Aw. Thank you.

07:01.072 --> 07:03.466
What's with the shrine
to Randall's holey underwear?

07:03.510 --> 07:05.250
See? I've been
telling him all morning

07:05.294 --> 07:07.862
-that he needs new undies.
-Please stop saying "undies."

07:07.905 --> 07:09.864
I got to go to class.

07:09.907 --> 07:11.256
I-I'll see you
for your birthday dinner.

07:11.300 --> 07:12.910
REBECCA:
Wait-- what were
you saying before,

07:12.954 --> 07:14.042
about the weird dreams?

07:14.085 --> 07:15.739
RANDALL:
Just midterm stress.

07:15.783 --> 07:18.481
Don't worry about it.

07:18.525 --> 07:20.483
Stop touching my underwear, Kev.

07:20.527 --> 07:21.963
Your undies, you mean?

07:23.312 --> 07:25.053
REBECCA:
You guys, I'm so sorry.

07:25.096 --> 07:28.273
I actually have to finish
getting ready to go to work.

07:28.317 --> 07:32.539
Uh, well, at least
tell me what you thought.

07:32.582 --> 07:33.627
About what?

07:33.670 --> 07:35.933
I was on Days of Our Lives.

07:35.977 --> 07:37.631
What?

07:37.674 --> 07:40.547
No, sweetheart,
you told me your line got cut.

07:40.590 --> 07:42.766
I mean, yeah, but my face
was still in it.

07:42.810 --> 07:45.552
Oh, honey.
Wha...?

07:45.595 --> 07:47.554
It's fine.
They made me look really pale

07:47.597 --> 07:49.164
'cause my character
had leukemia.

07:49.207 --> 07:51.514
Well, are there gonna
be any reruns?

07:51.558 --> 07:53.081
Doubt it.

07:53.124 --> 07:56.563
Kev, I'm so sorry. I didn't...

07:56.606 --> 07:58.956
You know what?
I do have to go to work,

07:59.000 --> 08:01.524
but promise me you'll tell me
everything about it tonight?

08:01.568 --> 08:03.221
Yeah, of course.

08:03.265 --> 08:04.832
Okay.

08:09.967 --> 08:13.014
-Anyone home at your house?

08:15.277 --> 08:17.671
-Hello.
-Oh...

08:17.714 --> 08:20.021
There's my beautiful daughter.

08:20.064 --> 08:21.588
-Hey.
-Hi.

08:21.631 --> 08:24.721
And there he is,
my beautiful superstar

08:24.765 --> 08:26.984
-son-in-law.
-Oh, my God.

08:27.028 --> 08:28.246
Oh!

08:28.290 --> 08:30.248
I saw you on Days.

08:30.292 --> 08:32.555
So convincing I could've cried.

08:32.599 --> 08:35.776
And still movie star handsome
under all that yellow makeup.

08:35.819 --> 08:37.778
Well, you know,
they cut my line.

08:37.821 --> 08:40.694
So? You go back
and get one next time.

08:40.737 --> 08:42.347
Yeah.

08:42.391 --> 08:44.567
Hey. Give me your eyes.

08:44.611 --> 08:48.005
-Never settle.
-Never will.

08:48.049 --> 08:49.180
-Okay.
-Okay.

08:49.224 --> 08:50.791
I'm so proud of you.

08:54.838 --> 08:56.753
DRIVER:
LAX. Terminal 4?

08:57.972 --> 09:00.670
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

10:03.733 --> 10:06.127
-This party sucks.

10:07.737 --> 10:08.695
-Movies?
-Movies.

10:08.738 --> 10:10.740
- And doughnuts.

10:10.784 --> 10:12.307
-Yes.

10:12.350 --> 10:13.874
I love you so much.

10:14.918 --> 10:17.660
I love you so much.

10:30.934 --> 10:34.764
-RANDALL: You're up?
-Why are your texts so formal?

10:34.808 --> 10:35.722
Whatever.

10:35.765 --> 10:37.462
Did I catch you on set?

10:37.506 --> 10:39.682
No. Uh, I finished
my reshoot last night.

10:39.726 --> 10:41.379
I'm actually not in L.A.

10:41.423 --> 10:43.904
-Oh. Well, where are you?
-Home.

10:43.947 --> 10:45.688
Or, well, what used
to be home, anyway.

10:45.732 --> 10:47.342
I'm in Pittsburgh.

10:47.385 --> 10:50.824
Doing something totally stupid.

10:50.867 --> 10:54.262
Or I don't-- Maybe not.
Maybe it's so crazy

10:54.305 --> 10:56.525
that it's actually sane.

10:56.568 --> 10:58.701
I'm going to a funeral.

10:58.745 --> 11:00.747
-Whose?

11:00.790 --> 11:02.705
Sophie's mom died.

11:02.749 --> 11:05.839
Oh, damn. You good?

11:05.882 --> 11:07.841
Who knows?

11:07.884 --> 11:09.930
What about you?

11:09.973 --> 11:12.715
Someone broke into our house
last night.

11:12.759 --> 11:14.543
What? Is everyone okay?

11:14.586 --> 11:16.501
Yeah. Everybody's fine.

11:16.545 --> 11:17.764
Please don't tell Mom...

11:45.879 --> 11:49.012
CLAIRE:
Okay, I've got Fresca,
I've got Prosecco.

11:49.056 --> 11:51.841
It's Fresecco time, my darlings.

11:53.190 --> 11:59.022
I would like to propose
an illegal toast

11:59.066 --> 12:00.850
to the future star.

12:00.894 --> 12:02.896
Thank you.

12:02.939 --> 12:04.767
Cheers.

12:04.811 --> 12:07.988
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

12:08.031 --> 12:09.772
Mmm.

12:09.816 --> 12:12.775
And speaking of stars...

12:14.037 --> 12:16.170
Mom, what did you do?

12:16.213 --> 12:21.479
I got two words for you:
aurora borealis.

12:23.307 --> 12:26.397
You and I are gonna see
the northern lights.

12:26.441 --> 12:29.661
-Mom, did you fix the pipes?

12:29.705 --> 12:31.663
What? Pipes shmipes.

12:31.707 --> 12:34.014
We're finally going, baby.

12:34.057 --> 12:37.582
It took two years
to save that money, Mom.

12:37.626 --> 12:39.584
-It's...
-You always do this.

12:39.628 --> 12:43.414
Wait, hey. Soph,
where are you going?

12:43.458 --> 12:45.939
- I need some air.
-Babe?

12:47.984 --> 12:50.030
Well,

12:50.073 --> 12:53.903
at least we made it half an hourbefore fighting this time.

12:55.078 --> 12:58.038
I was hoping we could have
a minute alone anyway.

12:58.081 --> 13:00.605
Um...

13:00.649 --> 13:02.216
I have to ask you something.

13:02.259 --> 13:04.827
-Spill it.
-Well, um,

13:04.871 --> 13:07.917
obviously, I couldn't
give Sophie her dream wedding,

13:07.961 --> 13:10.180
but I'm hoping
I can give her the ring

13:10.224 --> 13:11.529
that she's always wanted.

13:11.573 --> 13:14.837
Her grandmother's emerald ring?

13:14.881 --> 13:16.970
She said that you were
saving it for her.

13:20.451 --> 13:22.410
PASTOR:
And now we'll hear a few words

13:22.453 --> 13:25.935
from Claire's daughter Sophie.

13:39.949 --> 13:43.213
My mother was, um,

13:43.257 --> 13:45.215
impossible.

13:48.044 --> 13:53.136
I know I'm not supposed to say
that at her funeral, but...

13:53.180 --> 13:54.659
she was.

13:54.703 --> 13:58.925
She couldn't sit still,
in any sense of the phrase.

14:00.970 --> 14:04.931
Even when she was
diagnosed with MS,

14:04.974 --> 14:08.978
she refused... to stop moving.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.417
She never settled.

14:14.723 --> 14:17.073
When I finally got

14:17.117 --> 14:20.381
my, um, my dream apartment
in Brooklyn,

14:20.424 --> 14:24.472
she came to visit
and tour the neighborhood.

14:24.515 --> 14:28.476
And, um, we found
this coffee shop.

14:28.519 --> 14:32.132
It was a real hole
in the wall, but...

14:32.175 --> 14:34.917
it became our spot.

14:34.961 --> 14:39.966
Every time she visited and evenwhen she couldn't fly anymore,

14:40.009 --> 14:41.968
I would always bring her
fresh beans from there

14:42.011 --> 14:44.231
every time I came home.

14:46.755 --> 14:51.238
I was there when I found out
that she had died.

14:53.240 --> 14:55.851
I was being rude
to this poor clerk

14:55.895 --> 14:58.941
over how they were
out of their house blend.

14:58.985 --> 15:00.551
You know, I mean,
how do you run out

15:00.595 --> 15:03.293
of your house blend, right?
It was like...

15:03.337 --> 15:08.385
I was just grumpy
from the night shift and...

15:11.911 --> 15:15.436
What I wouldn't give
to go back to that moment.

15:18.134 --> 15:20.136
That moment before...

15:22.138 --> 15:25.794
...when she was still alive andmy biggest concern was coffee.

15:25.837 --> 15:28.623
Sorry.

15:42.158 --> 15:44.465
Looking back, I guess
I could have just settled

15:44.508 --> 15:45.770
for the French roast.

15:48.686 --> 15:52.603
And now I can never go back
to that coffee shop

15:52.647 --> 15:55.389
ever again.

15:55.432 --> 16:00.655
That place where my mom and I
had some of our best talks.

16:00.698 --> 16:03.658
Our best laughs.

16:03.701 --> 16:06.182
Some really phenomenal fights.

16:10.491 --> 16:14.103
'Cause that's the place that
I found out that she was gone.

16:17.324 --> 16:19.108
PASTOR:
Please join us
at Claire's house

16:19.152 --> 16:21.937
at 2:00 p.m.
for a reception in her honor.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.940
All family and friends
are welcome.

16:59.148 --> 17:01.933
Well, we checked
all the closets,

17:01.977 --> 17:04.719
and I don't, I don't know
where it is.

17:04.762 --> 17:06.329
But don't you worry.

17:06.373 --> 17:08.331
It's all gonna be okay.
Let's, uh,

17:08.375 --> 17:09.854
let's call reinforcements, okay?

17:09.898 --> 17:12.031
Come on.

17:13.380 --> 17:14.642
Bec.

17:14.685 --> 17:19.081
Sorry to have to wake you up
to ask, but...

17:20.778 --> 17:22.345
Hmm?

17:23.520 --> 17:26.654
You are the most beautiful
sick lady

17:26.697 --> 17:28.656
-I have ever seen.

17:28.699 --> 17:31.224
And you had to wake me up
to tell me that?

17:31.267 --> 17:33.313
Actually, no, um,

17:33.356 --> 17:36.533
the mobile that was
over Kevin's crib.

17:36.577 --> 17:38.318
Do you know where it is?

17:38.361 --> 17:41.147
Oh, no, that's gone, Jack.

17:41.190 --> 17:45.151
We gave all the, the crib stuffto the Goodwill.

17:45.194 --> 17:47.240
-Mm-hmm.
-: Damn it.

17:47.283 --> 17:49.807
Daddy?

18:03.299 --> 18:05.693
How about Good Will Hunting?

18:05.736 --> 18:07.129
SOPHIE:
Yeah.

18:07.173 --> 18:08.957
I've heard good things.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.178
You got a little, uh,face on your crumbs right there.

18:12.221 --> 18:13.179
-Let me get it for you.
-Yeah?

18:13.222 --> 18:14.745
Mm-hmm.

18:31.806 --> 18:35.331
CLAIRE:
So you want my mother's ring
to give to Soph?

18:36.376 --> 18:39.422
That ring has a story.

18:39.466 --> 18:44.427
Now, don't spread this around,
but my parents fell in love

18:44.471 --> 18:46.995
while they were both
going through divorces,

18:47.038 --> 18:50.085
which was not common
in that day.

18:50.129 --> 18:55.569
Before they could get married,my father was drafted to Korea.

18:55.612 --> 19:00.095
Now, he tried to give my motherthat ring before he left,

19:00.139 --> 19:03.185
but she refused it.

19:03.229 --> 19:07.755
She said,
wait till you get back.

19:07.798 --> 19:12.542
So he took the ring with him,
and whenever he felt hopeless,

19:12.586 --> 19:14.544
he looked at it

19:14.588 --> 19:18.461
and he found the determination
to make it through.

19:18.505 --> 19:20.333
When he came back,
they got married.

19:20.376 --> 19:23.205
-50 years.
-Wow.

19:23.249 --> 19:24.206
Yeah.

19:25.381 --> 19:28.689
Kev, you're gonna have
huge success,

19:28.732 --> 19:32.083
and that's gonna take you
lots of places.

19:34.434 --> 19:37.654
Is-is that a yes?

19:38.742 --> 19:42.224
I love you, kiddo.

19:42.268 --> 19:44.487
But I can't give you that ring.

19:44.531 --> 19:47.273
Not yet.

19:47.316 --> 19:52.234
Your marriage is too new,
and you're too young.

19:52.278 --> 19:55.759
You got to earn it, baby doll.

20:21.655 --> 20:24.701
-Hey.
-Hi.

20:26.312 --> 20:28.662
I would ask how you're doing,
but I...

20:28.705 --> 20:30.272
Yeah, no, I, uh...

20:31.317 --> 20:34.972
I can't believe you came.

20:35.016 --> 20:37.323
How could I not come?

20:40.108 --> 20:42.066
Are you, um, are you

20:42.110 --> 20:45.113
headed back right now? I'm sureyou got so much going on.

20:45.156 --> 20:46.767
What-what if I-I told you
I was thinking

20:46.810 --> 20:48.986
about maybe coming
to the reception?

20:49.030 --> 20:51.728
What would you say?

20:51.772 --> 20:55.602
I would say, uh, "Oh..."

20:57.560 --> 20:59.432
"Okay, that-- Good."

20:59.475 --> 21:01.477
Good.

21:03.436 --> 21:05.394
'Cause I'm standing
on the front lawn right now.

21:05.438 --> 21:09.355
Soph, I'm looking at you,
and I-I'm...

21:11.139 --> 21:13.141
I brought you these doughnuts
from that place

21:13.184 --> 21:14.708
that you like so much,
you know, the...

21:14.751 --> 21:17.363
I mean, I had two of them
on the way over here,

21:17.406 --> 21:19.452
I'm not gonna lie to you,but I-I saved the powdered ones

21:19.495 --> 21:21.018
'cause I remember
how much you love those.

21:23.630 --> 21:26.850
Wasn't sure if I should come in.

21:28.722 --> 21:31.551
No, that's probably
not a good idea.

21:45.869 --> 21:47.306
Get me out of here?

21:48.655 --> 21:50.352
Yeah. Yeah, come on.

21:58.621 --> 22:00.667
-Thanks for this.
-Yeah, of course.

22:02.495 --> 22:06.020
Is there anywhere
you want to go, or...?

22:06.063 --> 22:08.327
No.

22:10.633 --> 22:12.635
I don't know.

22:12.679 --> 22:14.376
Okay.

22:20.600 --> 22:23.124
You do what's in your heart,
son, you'll be fine.

22:28.782 --> 22:30.610
-MAN: Aw!

22:30.653 --> 22:32.786
Oh, come on, it was almost over.

22:32.829 --> 22:34.570
-What?
-Boo!

22:34.614 --> 22:36.572
Bel Air Dollar Theater patrons,

22:36.616 --> 22:39.532
we are currently experiencing
technical difficulties.

22:39.575 --> 22:41.534
We apologize
for the inconvenience.

22:41.577 --> 22:45.015
Please take this time
to help yourself

22:45.059 --> 22:48.410
to anything at the concession
stand, free of charge.

22:48.454 --> 22:50.934
-Let's eat.

23:00.291 --> 23:02.424
KEVIN:
That your grandmother's ring?

23:02.468 --> 23:04.818
Um, no.

23:08.125 --> 23:10.911
It's a nice ring, pretty.
He's...

23:10.954 --> 23:12.956
Grant's got great taste.

23:17.613 --> 23:19.702
He never really got to know her.

23:21.922 --> 23:25.708
I mean, they met a few times,
but...

23:25.752 --> 23:27.449
she was so sick.

23:29.843 --> 23:33.107
It's crazy I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life

23:33.150 --> 23:35.370
with someone who never
really knew her.

23:40.723 --> 23:43.857
You know, at the funeral today,I was about to lose it.

23:45.162 --> 23:46.773
I know.

23:51.168 --> 23:55.521
I found you there and...

23:55.564 --> 23:58.785
I locked in on you.

24:04.921 --> 24:07.924
Grief is a tricky thing,
you know?

24:07.968 --> 24:11.406
You... you just can't prepare

24:11.450 --> 24:15.149
for how it's gonna
make you feel or...

24:15.192 --> 24:17.281
how you'll handle it.

24:17.325 --> 24:18.544
Sometimes you just
got to grab onto...

24:18.587 --> 24:22.896
whatever's around you just to...

24:24.593 --> 24:26.595
...survive.

24:31.252 --> 24:32.383
Plus, we have a history

24:32.427 --> 24:34.516
of getting each other
through funerals.

24:38.389 --> 24:39.913
Okay, I've got one.
You ready?

24:42.785 --> 24:44.961
If you got one, I'm ready.

24:45.005 --> 24:47.747
He decides he has to get away,

24:47.790 --> 24:49.618
as far away as he can,

24:49.662 --> 24:52.578
so he becomes an ice fisherman

24:52.621 --> 24:54.928
-in Alaska.
-Oh, yes.

24:54.971 --> 24:58.366
And he never talks
to another human being again.

24:58.409 --> 25:00.934
Wow. Wow.

25:00.977 --> 25:04.241
Well done. That's good.

25:09.072 --> 25:11.771
Soph, can I take you somewhere?

25:13.642 --> 25:15.644
Okay.

25:33.662 --> 25:36.099
Here we are.

25:39.015 --> 25:40.234
You remember this place?

25:40.277 --> 25:42.410
Of course I do.

25:43.846 --> 25:46.501
How could I forget?

25:49.722 --> 25:51.724
Yeah, for the longest time,
I tried to.

25:53.987 --> 25:55.858
-SOPHIE: Oh! Sorry.
-Ooh.

25:57.773 --> 25:59.470
-Ah.
-Ugh.

25:59.514 --> 26:01.298
I swear...

26:01.342 --> 26:03.039
-You know, I...

26:03.083 --> 26:04.824
I'm gonna be sick, yeah.

26:04.867 --> 26:07.740
Maybe we should've waited
till they fixed the projector.

26:07.783 --> 26:10.656
-Nah.
-What do you mean, "nah"?

26:10.699 --> 26:12.832
-Now we'll never know
how it ended.
-Yeah, but,

26:12.875 --> 26:15.835
until it blacked out, wasn't it,like, the perfect movie?

26:15.878 --> 26:17.227
I mean, the real ending

26:17.271 --> 26:19.447
could never have been
good enough.

26:19.490 --> 26:22.493
This way, we can imagine
the perfect ending

26:22.537 --> 26:25.540
to the perfect movie
for the rest of our lives.

26:25.584 --> 26:28.499
Hmm, I don't know, I still wouldhave liked to have seen it.

26:28.543 --> 26:30.501
-Okay.

26:31.546 --> 26:33.853
I got an ending for you. Ready?

26:33.896 --> 26:36.333
Ready.

26:36.377 --> 26:39.772
Will realizes that he's in lovewith the best friend,

26:39.815 --> 26:41.817
the tall guy,
and they run away together.

26:41.861 --> 26:43.689
The whole thing
was a gay love story.

26:43.732 --> 26:45.516
-What?

26:49.085 --> 26:51.958
Let's never watch
the real ending.

26:54.047 --> 26:55.657
Never.

27:03.360 --> 27:07.060
-Brrr.
-You cold? Lets go inside.

27:10.846 --> 27:12.108
M'lady.

27:15.503 --> 27:16.635
Your chariot awaits.

27:22.945 --> 27:25.165
ADULT KEVIN:
I never thought
I could come back here.

27:29.517 --> 27:30.953
My childhood

27:30.997 --> 27:32.563
ended right here.

27:38.831 --> 27:42.922
For the longest time,
this whole... place,

27:42.965 --> 27:45.272
this whole town,

27:45.315 --> 27:48.710
all I ever wanted to do
was just...

27:48.754 --> 27:50.799
run away from it.

27:54.629 --> 27:56.936
Then a little time passed.

27:58.807 --> 28:00.983
And I started to remember
the good parts about it,

28:01.027 --> 28:04.900
like, uh, how we used
to come out here and...

28:04.944 --> 28:06.380
make each other laugh.

28:07.598 --> 28:10.645
How you were always
such a messy eater.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.778
- What?
-I mean, literally, like,
sometimes, I swear to God,

28:12.821 --> 28:14.562
you were, like, actively tryingto avoid your mouth.

28:14.605 --> 28:16.869
-Oh, come on.
-I'm serious.

28:16.912 --> 28:18.087
Look at, look at you--
exhibit "A."

28:18.131 --> 28:19.785
What? I-- oh, I'm so sorry

28:19.828 --> 28:21.874
we can't all eat
like a delicate little bird.

28:21.917 --> 28:22.701
-Okay.

28:30.839 --> 28:33.799
This place still makes me sad.

28:37.150 --> 28:39.630
But I'm not afraid
of it anymore.

28:44.853 --> 28:46.812
You're gonna be able to go backto that coffee shop,

28:46.855 --> 28:49.597
Soph, you will.

29:00.086 --> 29:01.914
Yeah, anything.

29:03.176 --> 29:05.178
Did you ever watch
the end of the movie?

29:09.008 --> 29:11.575
-Did you?
-No. No, never.

29:11.619 --> 29:13.403
I never did. Did you?

29:13.447 --> 29:15.405
No, me either.

32:54.624 --> 32:57.410
I was this close
to settling for Fanta,

32:57.453 --> 33:00.587
but I knew
you wouldn't approve,

33:00.630 --> 33:03.068
and, uh...

33:03.111 --> 33:05.461
we don't settle.

33:08.508 --> 33:11.859
I'm, uh, I'm just sticking
to Fresca these days,

33:11.902 --> 33:14.122
so I hope you don't mind.

33:23.566 --> 33:26.221
Well, Claire, I did it.

33:27.483 --> 33:29.529
I made it.

33:29.572 --> 33:33.620
I got a show,
I did a couple of movies.

33:33.663 --> 33:37.406
I became a star.

33:37.450 --> 33:39.321
Just like you knew I would.

33:41.236 --> 33:44.500
I didn't know I would,
but you did. You knew I would.

33:47.155 --> 33:49.505
Man, I really messed things up
with Sophie, though.

33:52.378 --> 33:54.336
A couple times, actually.

33:56.556 --> 33:59.341
And I have a feeling that, uh,

33:59.385 --> 34:02.910
you knew I would do that, too.

34:04.607 --> 34:08.220
You know, the sad part about itis, I'm actually ready now.

34:08.263 --> 34:10.744
I'm, I'm sober.

34:10.787 --> 34:14.052
And I am steady.

34:15.140 --> 34:17.359
I never earned that ring.

34:20.971 --> 34:24.279
God, I wish I had
another crack at it.

34:30.416 --> 34:33.201
It's too late.

34:33.245 --> 34:36.030
Enough of that. Anyway...

34:37.379 --> 34:39.338
This is for you, okay?

34:39.381 --> 34:41.514
And, uh...

34:41.557 --> 34:45.300
Oh. I almost forgot this.

34:55.745 --> 34:57.182
There you go.

35:02.404 --> 35:04.363
Goodbye, Claire.

35:23.251 --> 35:26.036
I'm not doing that.

35:26.080 --> 35:28.082
That's super weird.

35:35.872 --> 35:37.570
KATE :
Leave a message for Kate.

35:37.613 --> 35:41.574
Hey, Kate, uh, I'm about readyto hop on a flight back to L.A.

35:41.617 --> 35:43.663
It's been a tough
couple of days.

35:43.706 --> 35:46.970
Um... I was thinking,
when I land,

35:47.014 --> 35:49.364
you mind if I just come over
and see Jack?

35:49.408 --> 35:52.411
You know what? I...
I'm just coming over, okay?

36:01.420 --> 36:02.899
Oh, great.

36:02.943 --> 36:06.033
This is exactly
what I need right now.

36:06.076 --> 36:08.078
I'm just here to see Jack.

36:08.122 --> 36:09.341
Well, he's not here.

36:09.384 --> 36:11.604
Kate and Jack went to a retreat,Toby's at work.

36:11.647 --> 36:13.258
I'm just here to walk Audio.

36:13.301 --> 36:15.260
Oh. Hmm.

36:15.303 --> 36:17.523
Okay.

36:19.742 --> 36:22.441
I was gonna make tea
if you want some.

36:23.485 --> 36:26.488
Sure. Yeah, no,
that, that sounds great.

36:26.532 --> 36:28.229
Thank you.

36:34.540 --> 36:37.456
Hey.

36:37.499 --> 36:38.718
Are you okay?

36:38.761 --> 36:42.156
Oh, yeah. I am fabulous.

36:42.200 --> 36:45.072
The fifth guy in a row
just broke up with me

36:45.115 --> 36:47.901
because he just can't see us
having a future together,

36:47.944 --> 36:51.687
and I spent the day picking up
my best friend's dog's poop.

36:51.731 --> 36:54.516
So, that's my life at 33.

36:56.344 --> 36:58.825
I have never been
broken up with before.

36:58.868 --> 37:02.045
Why would you even say that
to me right now?

37:02.089 --> 37:03.525
No, I s-- That's...

37:03.569 --> 37:05.310
Yes, that-that sounded
completely insensitive.

37:05.353 --> 37:08.878
What I was getting at,
you know, was, um,

37:08.922 --> 37:11.446
I don't get dumpedbecause I'm always the first one

37:11.490 --> 37:13.492
to cut and run.

37:13.535 --> 37:17.496
When things get, you know,
complicated or, uh,

37:17.539 --> 37:20.716
God forbid, too deep.

37:20.760 --> 37:23.719
Recommendation?

37:23.763 --> 37:26.461
From a-a movie star
bathed in privilege?

37:26.505 --> 37:29.638
Why not?

37:29.682 --> 37:31.336
I don't think you should look
at yourself as the person

37:31.379 --> 37:34.513
who always gets left.

37:34.556 --> 37:36.297
You should look
at yourself as the person

37:36.341 --> 37:39.431
who's willing to stay and fight.

37:39.474 --> 37:42.129
It's a good thing.

37:43.173 --> 37:45.611
I wish I had more of that in me.

37:49.354 --> 37:51.573
JACK:
Sorry, but your mobile
is gone, bud.

37:51.617 --> 37:54.489
I miss my sheep.

37:54.533 --> 37:58.014
Yeah, I know,
but the sheep are gone, Kev.

37:59.364 --> 38:03.411
Look, sometimes we lose things.

38:03.455 --> 38:05.326
Things that we love.

38:05.370 --> 38:08.590
And it makes us feel sad.

38:08.634 --> 38:11.506
Really sad.

38:14.292 --> 38:16.555
And I know right now
it feels like

38:16.598 --> 38:18.252
the worst thing in the world.

38:19.993 --> 38:22.474
But I promise you,

38:22.517 --> 38:26.391
you're gonna find
something else to love.

38:38.054 --> 38:39.578
Like, I'll bet...

38:40.883 --> 38:44.365
