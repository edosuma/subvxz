Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:03.462 --> 00:04.672
May I present to you...

00:04.839 --> 00:06.924
Melinda May, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:07.216 --> 00:08.884
Send the Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.
to the surface.

00:09.051 --> 00:10.511
That's where they send people
to die.

00:10.678 --> 00:13.305
There's one last thing I need you to do.

00:16.851 --> 00:18.728
Flint!

00:19.020 --> 00:20.896
I was just kidnapped by a crazy woman.

00:21.063 --> 00:24.066
- Don't worry. She's with me.
- If I find you're keeping things from me,

00:24.233 --> 00:26.110
there will be consequences.

00:28.446 --> 00:30.698
What is this about your brother
coming for the Destroyer?

00:30.865 --> 00:33.075
I'm only here because of Father's orders.

00:42.626 --> 00:44.670
I'm never leaving you again.

01:02.897 --> 01:04.522
Find me some clothes.

01:05.066 --> 01:06.901
- What's the plan, Fitz?
- Uh...

01:07.902 --> 01:11.322
I have a ship.
We get there, then comes the plan.

01:16.077 --> 01:19.121
- Hey, how's your head?
- I'll tell you when the ringing stops.

01:19.789 --> 01:23.626
By the way,
"Fight to the death"? Really?

01:24.335 --> 01:26.796
Yeah, well, I had to make
a splashy entrance.

01:27.004 --> 01:28.964
Well, you could have jumped
in the octagon yourself,

01:29.131 --> 01:31.592
- then.
- No. Wouldn't be fair. I do push-ups now.

01:32.093 --> 01:33.594
Double digits, so...

01:34.637 --> 01:37.848
You have no idea, how good it is
to see you. You're here,

01:38.099 --> 01:41.143
- with a spaceship. Seems impossible.
- Nothing is impossible anymore.

01:41.310 --> 01:42.812
- Full story later.
- Yeah, there will be pints.

01:42.978 --> 01:44.522
There will be gin.

01:44.605 --> 01:45.439
Whoa!

01:45.564 --> 01:47.399
- Oh, my God!
- Whoa!

01:47.566 --> 01:49.193
Her implant.
They must be messing with it.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.529
- Well, what... what... what do we do?
- Just get it out.

01:57.743 --> 02:00.287
Okay. Hey, hey, hey.
Jemma. Jemma.

02:00.871 --> 02:02.456
This is gonna hurt.

02:03.207 --> 02:06.502
Hey!

02:22.685 --> 02:25.229
I've got it. I've got it.

02:32.027 --> 02:34.363
We gotta go!

02:35.322 --> 02:36.323
Come on.

02:45.207 --> 02:47.168
There's the ship.
Just got to get past...

02:51.255 --> 02:53.674
- Don't tell me that was...
- Our way out.

03:18.908 --> 03:21.577
- Is it noticeable?
- It should be.

03:23.662 --> 03:26.040
Scars are badges of honour for the victor.

03:26.999 --> 03:30.502
As expected, your priorities
are misplaced.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.463
What news of the Destroyer?

03:33.672 --> 03:37.051
She has no power, no ship,
and nowhere to run.

03:37.968 --> 03:42.014
- Have patience, dear brother.
- Patience is a feeble cover for inaction.

03:43.307 --> 03:44.308
Double the guard.

03:44.475 --> 03:48.479
- Have them sweep floor by floor...
- While your expertise is appreciated,

03:49.021 --> 03:51.023
I have the matter under control.

03:52.233 --> 03:55.361
There's a system in place,
and it has served me well.

03:55.903 --> 04:00.908
Sinara will end this inconvenience.
As you saw by her display in the Crater,

04:01.075 --> 04:03.702
she is the most capable warrior
in my employ.

04:04.328 --> 04:09.375
Your best has proven inadequate.
You remember my man, Maston-Dar, here?

04:09.541 --> 04:11.418
He'll make quick work of this.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.718
- A Terran weapon.
- Of course.

04:21.887 --> 04:24.181
Bring any human weaponry you possess.

04:25.140 --> 04:28.143
Maston finds it unfair hunting primitives
with anything

04:28.352 --> 04:30.437
but their own primitive armaments.

04:46.412 --> 04:48.831
Show them how we spill blood.
And, uh...

04:49.790 --> 04:51.083
find the girl in the process.

05:03.262 --> 05:05.597
This is the price
of hiding Inhumans.

05:06.557 --> 05:10.144
Continue to keep your mouths shut,
and you'll end up dead, too.

05:10.769 --> 05:13.439
This is bigger than a renewal.
It's a direct threat.

05:13.605 --> 05:15.190
These people will give us up
in a heartbeat

05:15.357 --> 05:16.942
if it'll save their own lives.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.862
These Kree may be cruel,
but they're not stupid.

05:20.029 --> 05:23.198
It's only a matter of time till this trail
of bodies leads them right to us.

05:23.365 --> 05:24.867
It's time for us to make a move.

05:40.591 --> 05:43.886
Finally.
There's work to be done.

05:47.389 --> 05:49.933
Faulnak loves to play general.
Let him.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.894
I need him to be satiated.

05:52.519 --> 05:56.190
He's the gatekeeper to my father,
to our freedom.

05:58.817 --> 05:59.818
"Our"?

06:00.986 --> 06:02.029
Don't be dramatic.

06:03.614 --> 06:06.283
He gives the orders now, no?

06:08.786 --> 06:11.163
I see. You're resentful
because I allowed him

06:11.330 --> 06:14.249
to throw you in the Crater.
Well, look at you. No worse for wear.

06:14.416 --> 06:16.168
You held your own against
the Destroyer of Worlds,

06:16.335 --> 06:17.586
as I knew you would.

06:17.878 --> 06:21.256
Your strength has never let me down.

06:22.674 --> 06:25.427
And now I ask for you to lend it to me
once again.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.555
We're so close, Sinara...

06:29.515 --> 06:35.104
to freedom from this place.
Restore to glory together.

06:38.774 --> 06:42.903
- You're begging. It's repulsive.
- I'm imploring you to think.

06:45.656 --> 06:47.032
To use reason.

06:48.117 --> 06:53.205
I must appease my brother,
and I cannot allow him to steal my reward.

06:54.957 --> 06:58.127
I will keep him entertained.
We'll let his man chase her tail...

06:59.795 --> 07:02.714
while you figure out what's in her head.

07:08.637 --> 07:10.055
Where will she go?

07:34.455 --> 07:36.290
So, the last time I saw Yo-Yo
and the others,

07:36.457 --> 07:39.418
they were at a salvage yard
on one of the upper floors.

07:39.877 --> 07:42.504
- How you feeling, Jemma?
- Oh, somewhere between motion-sick

07:42.671 --> 07:44.173
and...

07:47.050 --> 07:49.386
That's not helping.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.439
Damn it.

08:01.732 --> 08:02.774
Wait.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.528
Fitz, give me a boost.

08:10.616 --> 08:12.493
I'm just happy
not to be standing still.

08:12.659 --> 08:15.746
- Feels good to be on the run.
- Together.

09:22.771 --> 09:23.897
Hello!

09:29.111 --> 09:33.031
That is the third Vrellnexian
I have eliminated in pursuit of you!

09:34.116 --> 09:37.536
Not to toot my own horn,
as you would say.

09:37.995 --> 09:40.163
I would never say that.

09:41.456 --> 09:44.501
- Who the hell are you?
- My name is Enoch.

09:45.836 --> 09:47.087
Fitz sent me.

09:48.171 --> 09:49.256
Fitz?

09:52.259 --> 09:56.471
- How are you not eaten by those things?
- They have no interest in me,

09:56.722 --> 09:59.641
as I have no tender insides for them
to extract.

10:00.892 --> 10:03.061
I thought Fitz was done building robots.

10:04.396 --> 10:05.647
I am not a robot.

10:07.357 --> 10:11.987
I am a sentient Chronicom
from the constellation you know as Cygnus.

10:12.988 --> 10:14.323
I am here to aid you...

10:15.407 --> 10:18.160
you who will save humanity...

10:19.036 --> 10:22.122
Melinda May, Jemma Simmons...

10:22.664 --> 10:24.082
Phillip J. Coulson.

10:25.751 --> 10:29.921
- Say that name again?
- Phillip J. Coulson.

10:31.506 --> 10:32.549
You're the son of a bitch

10:32.716 --> 10:35.719
from that diner who got us
into this whole mess! You...

10:35.927 --> 10:39.056
I am here to get you out
of this whole mess.

10:40.641 --> 10:44.019
It would appear I got here just in time.

10:45.896 --> 10:47.230
I'm managing.

10:48.815 --> 10:52.110
Have you properly diagnosed the extent
of your injuries?

10:54.279 --> 10:56.448
Bilateral tear of the quadriceps.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.410
By all accounts,
you should not be standing.

11:01.119 --> 11:02.454
Are you a doctor?

11:03.121 --> 11:04.164
No.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.291
I'm a fighter.

11:07.125 --> 11:08.251
Still?

11:10.921 --> 11:16.134
It may be time for a career change.

11:17.010 --> 11:21.640
There's a gravity storm approaching.

11:21.932 --> 11:23.308
They're moving away.

11:23.558 --> 11:26.853
Are they afraid of gravity storms?
Or you?

11:27.312 --> 11:30.107
The Vrellnexians ride the gravity storms,
but...

11:31.983 --> 11:33.610
I don't think it's me.

11:37.114 --> 11:39.574
I think they're afraid of something else.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.172
No! No!

12:04.141 --> 12:05.142
Halt.

12:14.818 --> 12:18.238
- The Destroyer, where is she?
- I... I don't know. I haven't... I...

12:21.867 --> 12:26.538
- No!
- Try again. The Destroyer, where is she?

12:38.508 --> 12:42.721
- They're killing people, innocent people.
- In their hunt for me.

12:43.597 --> 12:44.973
We're not gonna let anything happen
to you.

12:45.140 --> 12:49.102
That's right. We need to make a move
on those blue bloods.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.605
Not with Daisy and Simmons
still captive.

12:52.355 --> 12:53.982
- We need to get out of the Lighthouse.
- Tess...

12:54.149 --> 12:56.568
So, instead of rescue them,
we abandon them?

12:57.068 --> 12:59.529
We don't have a choice right now.
They would do the same thing.

12:59.696 --> 13:02.491
I agree. We regroup and come back
for them more prepared.

13:02.657 --> 13:04.159
- Where's Tess?
- Where can we even go?

13:04.326 --> 13:06.036
Not a lot of hiding places in space.

13:06.203 --> 13:09.498
To the point at the end
of this giant question mark, the surface.

13:09.664 --> 13:10.957
Where is Tess?

13:20.133 --> 13:21.760
Did something happen? Is she...

13:26.973 --> 13:28.141
I'm sorry.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.784
It's okay. I got this.

13:52.833 --> 13:56.336
You were always more interested
in the power behind a weapon.

13:58.588 --> 14:00.131
The ability to kill.

14:03.635 --> 14:05.720
The craftsmanship was what caught my eye.

14:06.304 --> 14:09.599
Once again, misplaced priorities.

14:10.892 --> 14:14.980
These particular tools from Earth seem
a nice cross-section

14:15.146 --> 14:16.481
of our areas of interest.

14:17.440 --> 14:18.984
Firearms are fine...

14:19.818 --> 14:22.445
for those who need the safety of distance.

14:27.325 --> 14:28.660
I prefer a blade.

14:29.661 --> 14:33.164
Feel the warm blood on my hands
as the life drains

14:33.331 --> 14:35.000
from my adversary's body.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.919
Spoken like a true child of our father.

14:38.086 --> 14:42.507
Maybe if you'd bothered to sound more
like him, you'd be less of a disgrace!

14:47.262 --> 14:48.513
A disgrace...

14:52.142 --> 14:55.812
who, with no prior training,
was placed in charge of his own fleet.

14:55.979 --> 14:59.107
A disgrace who fought as you did
against our enemies.

14:59.274 --> 15:02.861
You lost a strategic outpost and thousands
of warriors' lives in the process.

15:03.028 --> 15:05.947
- I was put in an impossible situation.
- Excuses.

15:06.114 --> 15:08.533
I was cornered, outmanned and overrun.

15:09.701 --> 15:13.163
Two of my trusted generals dead
at my feet, enemies closing in.

15:18.752 --> 15:22.047
- And so, you ran.
- What option did I have?

15:22.213 --> 15:24.841
Glory! Drink the Odium.

15:25.050 --> 15:29.012
Fight and die like any
of the Kasius family name would have...

15:29.971 --> 15:32.599
rather than fleeing
with your low-born subordinate.

15:33.058 --> 15:34.100
I wondered...

15:34.893 --> 15:37.312
is it her beauty that you admire...

15:38.188 --> 15:41.524
- or her ability to kill?
- Sinara defended me.

15:42.400 --> 15:45.445
- She cut down my would-be attackers...
- And you were both exiled

15:45.612 --> 15:48.114
- for abandoning your posts!
- She saved my life!

15:51.576 --> 15:54.371
She's been by my side ever since.
You call me weak.

15:54.996 --> 15:57.207
My strength comes from surrounding
myself...

15:58.458 --> 16:00.543
- with loyalty.
- More platitudes.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.588
The only thing that runs deeper
than the river of blood

16:03.755 --> 16:07.550
from your fallen soldiers is the shame
you bring on our family.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.388
You're like this planet, brother.

16:13.098 --> 16:18.937
Once full of promise and father's hopes
to be moulded into something magnificent.

16:21.147 --> 16:22.148
And now...

16:22.941 --> 16:28.446
just a broken speck of dust confined
to the darkest edge of the galaxy.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.867
I'm eager for my man to find
the Destroyer...

16:34.494 --> 16:36.788
so I can take leave of both.

17:04.607 --> 17:06.233
These pipes are hot.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.862
Wonder if that means
this is the spa floor.

17:09.029 --> 17:13.157
Ah, spa sounds great. I'd kill
for a hot shower and a comfy bed.

17:14.951 --> 17:16.118
This one's cold.

17:16.703 --> 17:18.663
There's a lot of power running
into here.

17:19.247 --> 17:23.251
Tracking signs of airborne contaminants,
mould, harmful chemicals, carbon monoxide.

17:23.417 --> 17:24.752
An air-filtration system.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.797
This must be the hub
for life-support systems.

17:28.048 --> 17:29.507
Well, of course there'd be one.

17:29.674 --> 17:32.802
This station is essentially
a giant vivarium for humans.

17:42.020 --> 17:45.231
Well, I think I know how they're creating
the artificial gravity for the station.

17:45.607 --> 17:47.692
- That can't be.
- What is it?

17:48.068 --> 17:50.320
Unless I'm mistaken, and I hope I am,
that's...

17:50.487 --> 17:51.821
Gravitonium.

17:55.992 --> 17:58.495
- Fitz!
- Submit willingly or entertain me.

17:58.661 --> 18:00.663
These are your options.

18:16.805 --> 18:18.389
Get back!

18:41.121 --> 18:44.624
Okay.
Okay. Sit down.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.209
Okay.

18:46.668 --> 18:48.670
Careful.

18:56.219 --> 18:57.637
Hey.

18:58.429 --> 19:00.431
Good thing
I'm wearing a helmet.

19:02.684 --> 19:05.145
You. You come to collect the bounty?

19:05.311 --> 19:07.856
- No, I came to save your ass.
- I should kill you right now.

19:08.022 --> 19:10.024
- Who the hell is this guy?
- He works for Kasius.

19:10.191 --> 19:13.027
I don't work for... I mean,
sometimes I do, technically,

19:13.194 --> 19:15.822
but right now, I'm Team S.H.I.E.L.D.,
all right?

19:16.114 --> 19:17.740
It's convenient, you showing up
right now.

19:17.907 --> 19:20.618
"Convenient"? No, it's mind-blowing
that I managed to escape my room

19:20.785 --> 19:23.621
after Coulson welded the door shut.
I had to crack a window.

19:23.788 --> 19:26.166
A lot of my personal valuables
are now floating around space,

19:26.249 --> 19:27.834
- thanks very much, everybody.
- So, this story's supposed

19:27.917 --> 19:29.794
to make me feel better?
That Coulson locked you up?

19:29.961 --> 19:31.212
Working out our differences, all right?

19:31.379 --> 19:33.298
- I don't have time to get into this...
- Can we discuss this after

19:33.464 --> 19:36.843
- we're out of the line of fire?
- Yes, thank you... this guy.

19:37.010 --> 19:39.262
Now please follow me.
We go up the service shafts.

19:39.429 --> 19:41.181
- It'll lead us right onto the trawler.
- No, no, no, no.

19:41.347 --> 19:43.975
This is the guy that sold me to Kasius.

19:44.475 --> 19:48.354
- Oh. Kill him. He's a snake.
- I'm gonna cut his throat open.

19:48.563 --> 19:50.440
- Sorry.
- I'm a pragmatist, all right?

19:50.607 --> 19:51.691
Just lis... just listen.

19:51.858 --> 19:54.944
I told you that I would lead you
to your friend. There she is.

19:55.570 --> 19:57.322
And I stopped you from doing
something drastic

19:57.488 --> 20:00.116
that would have gotten people
killed in the process.

20:01.242 --> 20:03.578
- Though you don't look great.
- Thank you.

20:03.995 --> 20:07.165
And now you just happen
to stumble upon us?

20:07.332 --> 20:09.083
All the channels are buzzing
with the news of your escape.

20:09.250 --> 20:11.544
I just had to follow
the dead bodies. It led me right to you.

20:11.711 --> 20:14.756
We are out of time!

20:16.090 --> 20:17.842
How do we know you're not gonna lead us
into another trap?

20:19.719 --> 20:20.720
You don't.

20:41.699 --> 20:42.951
Hey.

20:46.663 --> 20:48.831
- Look, I know Tess...
- You didn't know Tess.

20:51.542 --> 20:52.627
You're right.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.588
You don't know nothing about me, either.

20:58.508 --> 21:01.094
Well, you're not the first person
to tell me that.

21:07.350 --> 21:10.186
I'm not here to tell you anything
you don't already know.

21:11.312 --> 21:12.397
I'm just...

21:13.940 --> 21:17.110
Well, I'm just here... if you need me.

21:21.739 --> 21:23.157
It's not fair.

21:24.993 --> 21:26.077
Yeah.

21:26.995 --> 21:28.037
Well...

21:32.709 --> 21:33.918
...it never is.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.799
I lost people too, and...

21:41.968 --> 21:43.511
it doesn't ever get easier.

21:45.346 --> 21:48.599
Thought you weren't gonna tell me
something I didn't already know.

21:52.562 --> 21:55.523
Maybe I should just turn myself in,
stop more people from dying.

21:55.690 --> 21:59.068
No. You have a gift now.

21:59.485 --> 22:03.281
- You can help people, protect them.
- "Protect them." I couldn't protect Tess.

22:04.657 --> 22:07.785
Couldn't protect my parents. What happens
if I can't protect you, either?

22:11.331 --> 22:12.874
Stay put. I got you.

22:22.216 --> 22:24.802
- I thought they'd be here.
- Daisy?

22:27.638 --> 22:29.432
How did you escape?

22:29.599 --> 22:30.850
Clumsily. Hey.

22:33.895 --> 22:35.438
- Fitz!
- Turbo!

22:36.022 --> 22:37.690
Man, it's good to see you!

22:38.149 --> 22:40.068
How the hell did you get in the future?

22:40.234 --> 22:42.695
- Uh, the long way.
- He needs medical attention.

22:42.862 --> 22:45.490
- Story time can wait.
- Well, not when those stories include

22:45.656 --> 22:46.949
time travel.

22:50.703 --> 22:54.791
This guy? The hell you doing here?
And how'd you get out of your cage?

22:54.957 --> 22:58.002
Well, I let myself out,
but thanks very much for your concern.

22:59.087 --> 23:02.048
- Well, the gang's all here except May.
- Except May.

23:02.924 --> 23:04.550
She was taken to the surface?

23:05.676 --> 23:06.677
Yeah.

23:07.095 --> 23:08.471
- That's a good thing.
- Is it?

23:08.638 --> 23:11.432
- We need alcohol for his wound.
- I'll see if Flint can find something.

23:11.599 --> 23:12.683
Get out of here.

23:15.603 --> 23:16.646
Flint, can...

23:19.023 --> 23:20.149
Oh, no.

23:33.246 --> 23:36.749
You. You know the whereabouts
of the escaped Inhuman?

23:42.797 --> 23:44.799
Yeah. I do.

23:48.594 --> 23:50.388
Too many people have died.

23:51.514 --> 23:54.100
- Good people.
- You were offered the highest honour

23:54.267 --> 24:01.232
a human could hope for, to join Kasius
below and see others rewarded in kind.

24:01.691 --> 24:04.360
Now, they'll get nothing.

24:20.209 --> 24:24.088
But good you turned yourself in.

24:26.716 --> 24:29.886
I won't let any more innocent lives
be lost.

24:30.887 --> 24:32.346
Not for me.

24:59.957 --> 25:01.375
That was for Tess.

25:10.468 --> 25:12.553
- I'll alert command.
- No.

25:13.179 --> 25:14.472
But he's the Inhuman.

25:16.265 --> 25:17.391
He's bait.

25:29.946 --> 25:32.657
- What are his powers again?
- He can move rocks with his mind.

25:32.949 --> 25:34.909
- How is he in a fight?
- Undisciplined,

25:35.076 --> 25:36.327
but I'm guessing not incompetent.

25:36.536 --> 25:39.497
He's in over his head on this one, though.
We all might be, but...

25:39.705 --> 25:42.750
- it never stopped us before.
- They don't know I have this.

25:54.637 --> 25:55.805
Don't hurt the kid.

25:57.139 --> 25:58.849
I'm the one you want.

26:01.227 --> 26:02.436
On your knees.

26:05.398 --> 26:07.608
Just take me. Let him go.

26:09.193 --> 26:10.486
I'll take you both.

26:19.870 --> 26:22.623
Rocks, huh? That's cool. Come on.

26:26.919 --> 26:28.421
Let's go, let's go!

26:42.518 --> 26:44.812
Scrappy. Let's put an end to this.

26:54.822 --> 26:57.283
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.625
- Everyone here?
- Yeah. We're all accounted for.

27:05.791 --> 27:08.753
- Well, most of me, anyway.
- Mr and Mrs Boba Fett

27:08.919 --> 27:10.880
- will be here any minute.
- So, what do we do now?

27:11.047 --> 27:13.758
- We escape via the trawler.
- Escape to where?

27:14.925 --> 27:19.555
The surface. All signs have been pointing
us there. The Kree won't follow us there,

27:19.722 --> 27:21.599
and you don't have to follow us there,
either.

27:21.766 --> 27:24.769
Hey, man, I already told you
that I'm in, to go out with you.

27:25.269 --> 27:27.271
No one's getting out of here
if they catch us first.

27:33.277 --> 27:36.280
Less arguing, more figuring out
what the hell we're gonna do.

27:49.001 --> 27:52.213
That ought to buy us some time.

28:05.685 --> 28:06.686
Or not.

28:12.108 --> 28:14.819
- I thought I told you not to go out there.
- You told me to use my powers

28:14.985 --> 28:16.987
- to protect people.
- This isn't your problem to fix.

28:17.154 --> 28:19.073
- It is my problem! They're after me!
- And me.

28:19.156 --> 28:20.908
- And me.
- I don't think they're gonna be picky

28:20.991 --> 28:23.619
about who they kill.

28:26.414 --> 28:27.832
Well, we can't leave
with this place surrounded.

28:27.915 --> 28:30.751
Come on. A room full of secret agents,
scientists, and superheroes.

28:30.918 --> 28:33.212
- Someone give me something.
- We stand our ground and fight.

28:33.421 --> 28:36.006
Yeah, with what? Rocks and rubbish?

28:36.841 --> 28:37.842
I can fight with rocks.

28:37.925 --> 28:39.343
How else do you propose
to get out of here?

28:39.427 --> 28:42.263
- We don't go out. We go up.
- There's no elevators here.

28:43.764 --> 28:46.058
Then we make our own elevator with this.

28:48.185 --> 28:50.646
- A belt buckle?
- It's an anti-gravity device.

28:52.898 --> 28:55.234
This chute leads directly to the drop bay
under the trawler.

28:55.401 --> 28:56.861
We can get to the airlock from there.

28:57.403 --> 28:59.071
We use the device to create
a gravity well.

28:59.238 --> 29:00.823
Will it work?

29:00.990 --> 29:02.450
- Yeah, it'll work.
- It's our best option

29:02.616 --> 29:03.951
- at this point.
- I'll go first. I'll show you

29:04.034 --> 29:05.494
how it works. And then I'll drop
the puck down,

29:05.661 --> 29:08.330
- the next person can come up.
- No, no, no.

29:08.497 --> 29:10.708
Not a chance. I'm not gonna
let you use us as bait

29:10.875 --> 29:13.961
while you make your grand escape.
Fitz, Simmons, you're up.

29:15.129 --> 29:16.297
You're last.

29:19.967 --> 29:21.635
You're slow.

29:30.186 --> 29:32.313
- Once more unto the breach.
<i>- Allons-y.</i>

29:46.160 --> 29:48.412
All right, Yo-Yo, you're up next.
Let's keep it moving.

30:08.390 --> 30:10.434
Stand back. I'll handle them.

30:47.471 --> 30:50.558
- I'm the last one. You satisfied?
- You sure they can't follow us?

30:50.724 --> 30:52.852
No, they can definitely follow us.
It's gonna take them a while.

30:53.018 --> 30:55.187
All right. So, you ready
to take this thing out?

30:57.815 --> 30:59.608
- What, me? I'm not a pilot.
- What?

31:00.109 --> 31:03.487
- You don't know how to fly this thing?
- I never said I did.

31:06.115 --> 31:09.159
Okay. What about you, Flint?
Wasn't Virgil giving you flying lessons?

31:09.493 --> 31:13.831
Well, yeah. And I'm not bad, but, uh...
I'm not leaving with you guys.

31:14.832 --> 31:16.709
What do you mean you're not leaving
with us? You have to.

31:16.876 --> 31:18.085
This whole station will kill you on sight.

31:18.252 --> 31:21.297
Look, you told me to use my powers
to protect people, right?

31:22.214 --> 31:25.634
They're in this mess because of me.
I can't just abandon them.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.721
I'm gonna figure out a way
to get them out of it.

31:33.100 --> 31:34.268
Okay.

31:36.103 --> 31:38.731
Well, I guess we're gonna have to come up
with a plan, then, don't we?

31:41.191 --> 31:43.611
- "We"?
- Yeah, we. Remember what I told you?

31:44.486 --> 31:47.156
- I'm here if you need me. I got you.
- Me too.

31:47.990 --> 31:51.243
Wait. Mack. What about never splitting up?

31:51.619 --> 31:53.913
Yeah, I know, sir, but I'm not leaving him
behind.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.540
Look. We'll handle things here.
You get to the surface and figure out

31:56.624 --> 31:58.250
what the hell all this is about.

31:59.501 --> 32:02.129
- Be safe.
- I'll see you soon.

32:09.386 --> 32:12.181
Oh. Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

32:12.806 --> 32:15.643
Okay, if you guys really are gonna go
fight a bunch of alien warriors,

32:15.809 --> 32:18.103
then you might be interested to know that,
in the past,

32:18.270 --> 32:21.065
I hid a crate of S.H.I.E.L.D. tech
in a wall on the base.

32:21.231 --> 32:23.067
Oh, that's what I'm talking about.
Thanks, Turbo.

32:23.233 --> 32:24.652
- Where?
- Level three.

32:26.195 --> 32:27.279
You got to be kidding me!

32:27.446 --> 32:30.449
You mean the level infested with aliens
that suck your blood?

32:32.284 --> 32:33.369
Well, how was I sup...

32:33.994 --> 32:36.121
I feel like I'm not getting
enough credit here.

32:36.288 --> 32:38.457
I have travelled through time and space
to find you.

32:38.624 --> 32:41.543
I think we're moving past
that bit a little bit too quickly.

32:41.710 --> 32:45.297
Tu... Turbo, Turbo,
we wouldn't expect anything less.

32:45.714 --> 32:46.757
Thank you.

32:48.801 --> 32:49.802
Good luck.

32:56.058 --> 33:00.187
So, taking off is easy enough,
docking is the hard part,

33:00.354 --> 33:03.816
and landing, that's impossible on account
of these ships weren't built

33:03.983 --> 33:06.944
- with landing gear.
- So, you have no idea what you're doing.

33:08.028 --> 33:10.072
I got a flying car.
How different can it be?

33:10.239 --> 33:12.950
Great.

33:16.036 --> 33:18.747
Hold on.

33:33.554 --> 33:37.516
How troublesome it is searching for rats
in a sewer.

33:38.726 --> 33:42.021
So many places to scurry away
and hide.

33:49.278 --> 33:50.529
Sinara.

33:51.530 --> 33:52.865
What news do you bring?

33:57.244 --> 33:58.454
Out with it, girl.

34:01.999 --> 34:05.544
- They have escaped.
- Escaped?

34:06.962 --> 34:08.005
To where?

34:09.297 --> 34:10.340
Friends.

34:11.175 --> 34:14.219
- On the surface.
- Impossible.

34:14.719 --> 34:17.056
So, the Destroyer of Worlds
has escaped,

34:17.306 --> 34:21.476
willingly makes for your land of exile
where apparently others have survived.

34:21.893 --> 34:25.856
Your incompetence
is almost admirably astounding.

34:26.023 --> 34:27.940
- There must be some...
- Ready a ship for Maston-Dar.

34:28.108 --> 34:30.652
If humans can survive the perils
of this planet,

34:30.819 --> 34:32.612
it will be just fine for him to pursue.

34:33.655 --> 34:34.656
Maston is dead.

34:36.408 --> 34:37.409
By whose hand?

34:38.786 --> 34:40.079
My own.

35:04.770 --> 35:06.188
Sinara.

35:07.106 --> 35:10.776
Holding your own
against the Destroyer of Worlds,

35:10.943 --> 35:13.278
felling my own best warrior.

35:15.614 --> 35:18.659
It seems, I underestimated you

35:19.493 --> 35:23.413
and your desire to climb higher
in the ranks...

35:24.123 --> 35:26.250
within which I now have an opening.

35:26.917 --> 35:30.045
My brother confines you
to his dungeon,

35:30.212 --> 35:32.381
denying you the right to shine.

35:33.340 --> 35:37.427
On my side,
you will shine more radiant

35:37.761 --> 35:39.680
than the stars we will conquer.

35:44.309 --> 35:46.478
A warrior such as yourself...

35:48.230 --> 35:50.983
deserves a leader worthy of your talents.

35:52.442 --> 35:56.780
I will show you things Kasius could never.

36:11.420 --> 36:14.840
Sinara is not some object to be taken.

36:25.309 --> 36:27.102
The truth, brother?

36:28.312 --> 36:31.481
We both know father sent me
on a suicide mission.

36:32.816 --> 36:35.277
Two of my generals were dead
at my feet, yes...

36:35.986 --> 36:37.696
because Sinara killed them.

36:38.864 --> 36:41.700
They were preventing me
from fleeing the battlefield.

36:43.493 --> 36:49.416
You see, Sinara said, and I agree,
that the battlefield is not my place.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.252
I'm not built for it.

36:54.254 --> 36:55.923
With the bloodshed left to her,

36:56.924 --> 36:59.009
I can focus on greater things...

37:00.594 --> 37:01.762
and have...

37:02.554 --> 37:05.891
I wasted so much time...

37:06.642 --> 37:09.102
on my knees, seeking your approval.

37:10.896 --> 37:11.939
No more.

37:12.105 --> 37:15.234
You play god over a dead rock.

37:16.109 --> 37:19.196
But you're just a coward who hides...

37:19.571 --> 37:22.824
then stabs his enemies in the back.

37:23.242 --> 37:24.618
And in the front.

37:39.883 --> 37:41.551
A life spent.

37:44.513 --> 37:46.139
A life earned.

38:01.697 --> 38:06.660
Think how warmly father will greet us
when we avenge my brother's death

38:06.827 --> 38:08.745
and bring him the Destroyer of Worlds.

38:12.374 --> 38:16.628
Everything we've ever wanted
will soon come to bear.

38:27.431 --> 38:30.392
- I'm never leaving your side again.
- Yeah, I feel the same way.

38:30.559 --> 38:33.520
- That's why I asked you to marry me.
- I a... Mm.

38:34.229 --> 38:35.522
Doesn't matter.

38:36.189 --> 38:37.316
I don't know about you,

38:37.482 --> 38:39.526
but I could really use a drink
right about now.

38:40.402 --> 38:42.237
I'm just happy for some alone time.

38:44.656 --> 38:46.700
Okay! So not exactly
like a flying car!

38:46.867 --> 38:48.577
We are so stupid!

38:48.744 --> 38:50.454
So much for smooth sailing.

38:50.620 --> 38:51.663
Hang on!

39:14.853 --> 39:17.189
Welcome back, Agent May.

39:17.898 --> 39:19.900
You hit your head quite hard.

39:24.613 --> 39:25.906
Where are we?

39:33.747 --> 39:34.831
The <i>Zephyr.</i>

39:36.666 --> 39:37.667
How?

39:38.335 --> 39:39.336
What is going on?

39:39.753 --> 39:44.758
They grabbed us just in time.
Anchored us against the gravity storm.

39:45.509 --> 39:46.593
Who?

40:07.614 --> 40:11.243
I have waited such a long time
to see you again.
