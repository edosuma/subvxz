[sighs]

00:15.820 --> 00:16.940
[groans softly]

00:50.580 --> 00:52.380
- [Brooke] Hey!
- Hey.

00:52.460 --> 00:54.540
Everything okay, Daniel?
You look stressed.

00:54.620 --> 00:58.140
Yeah, I'm just, uh... I've been thinking
about that Whitney game, you know?

00:58.220 --> 01:01.220
You look pale.
Maybe you should take it easy.

01:03.140 --> 01:04.900
See? Told you I was okay.

01:08.100 --> 01:10.100
[theme music playing]

01:39.660 --> 01:41.140
So, uh, what are you reading?

01:41.860 --> 01:44.740
Surf reports. Four-foot swells tomorrow.

01:44.820 --> 01:45.820
Oh, you surf?

01:47.820 --> 01:50.020
Obviously.
[clears throat] You do.

01:50.100 --> 01:53.460
- So, where are you from, Jackie?
- Everywhere. I bounced around a lot.

01:54.140 --> 01:55.140
Cool.

01:56.060 --> 01:59.620
Hey, I don't mean to be nosy,
but why were you in handcuffs at the exam?

02:04.180 --> 02:05.420
To protect Leo.

02:06.180 --> 02:08.940
I mean, did you hear how loud
he was playing his guitar?

02:09.020 --> 02:10.020
[Leo] Ha-ha.

02:12.260 --> 02:14.220
[Hayley] Even I would've strangled him.

02:19.260 --> 02:21.380
What? My notebook.

02:21.460 --> 02:23.860
How did this happen?
It was soaking wet. I threw it away.

02:23.940 --> 02:25.980
Well, I just remembered
I have a lot of homework to do.

02:33.580 --> 02:34.820
That was weird.

02:36.380 --> 02:37.380
Hey, Alex.

02:47.220 --> 02:48.780
I told you he needs some space.

02:58.740 --> 02:59.740
[Diggs] Eric...

03:00.740 --> 03:01.780
how's Carter holding up?

03:02.500 --> 03:05.020
You know him. He's a tough guy.
He'll get through this.

03:05.820 --> 03:08.860
Check this out.
Here's more information on Bill.

03:08.940 --> 03:11.500
- The missing park ranger?
- Yeah. We got a new lead.

03:11.580 --> 03:13.540
The GPS tracker chip on his Taser

03:13.620 --> 03:15.620
has been emitting a weak signal
near the Greenhouse,

03:15.700 --> 03:16.980
and I want you to check it out.

03:17.540 --> 03:19.340
Carter's kids just got accepted
into that school.

03:19.420 --> 03:21.780
Well, there you go. All the more reason
for you to handle this.

03:22.340 --> 03:23.460
All right, Chief.

03:23.540 --> 03:25.940
And find that Taser
before one of the kids does.

03:28.140 --> 03:31.860
I understand you have a job to do,
but how long is this search gonna take?

03:31.940 --> 03:33.740
We don't know.
It's a two-mile search radius.

03:33.820 --> 03:35.660
We'll be discreet,
but we have to be thorough.

03:35.740 --> 03:36.620
The longer you're here...

03:36.700 --> 03:39.380
Look, the GPS signal's been emitting
all week from the same spot.

03:39.460 --> 03:42.820
It means the ranger's Taser
was either lost or thrown out.

03:47.380 --> 03:49.900
- [choking] My diaphragm.
- I don't care about your diaphragm.

03:50.020 --> 03:51.420
I wanna know why you stole my sketchbook.

03:51.500 --> 03:53.180
What was going on
in that tiny little head of yours?

03:53.260 --> 03:55.980
- It's not tiny. It's proportional...
- Answer the question!

03:56.060 --> 03:58.100
I didn't steal it.
I borrowed it to fix it.

03:58.700 --> 03:59.780
Do you wanna see how?

04:01.260 --> 04:04.980
- [gasps and coughs]
- Show me, Einstein.

04:08.340 --> 04:10.100
I scanned the images from your sketchbook

04:10.180 --> 04:12.980
onto this multi-core,
i9 processor computer,

04:13.060 --> 04:15.500
and then I hooked up the 3-D printer
and made an exact replica.

04:15.580 --> 04:18.459
I even crumpled up the pages
to make it more realistic.

04:18.540 --> 04:20.579
So if I run out of money,
you can print me out some bills.

04:21.459 --> 04:22.820
- Uh...
- I'm kidding.

04:22.900 --> 04:25.260
- Show me my files.
- [exhales] Yeah.

04:25.340 --> 04:26.700
- Uh...
- [typing]

04:26.780 --> 04:30.220
Right there, where it says "Jackie."
Yeah, yeah, right there.

04:30.300 --> 04:31.500
Mmm-hmm.

04:32.180 --> 04:34.140
No, wait... No, no, no, no...

04:34.220 --> 04:35.100
No, no, no, no!

04:35.180 --> 04:37.300
You should click "no,"
because otherwise it's gonna...

04:39.020 --> 04:40.300
Thanks for the tour.

04:41.340 --> 04:42.700
I'm impressed.

04:44.340 --> 04:45.420
[door closes]

04:47.660 --> 04:48.860
Hey, what's up, man?

04:51.740 --> 04:52.740
Hey.

04:54.540 --> 04:55.580
You okay?

04:56.460 --> 04:58.180
- Yeah.
- Wait, wait, wait.

04:58.260 --> 04:59.540
Come one. Get up.
I wanna show you something.

04:59.620 --> 05:00.860
What?

05:00.940 --> 05:02.940
It's something especially for people
in your condition.

05:03.020 --> 05:05.260
- My condition?
- Yeah, your sad condition.

05:05.980 --> 05:08.500
[scoffs] You're a real downer, Woods.
Nobody ever told you that?

05:09.580 --> 05:10.580
Come on.

05:20.860 --> 05:21.980
[sighs]

05:22.820 --> 05:24.300
[exhales heavily]

05:26.340 --> 05:28.380
- Hey, babe.
- Good practice?

05:29.020 --> 05:31.580
- Yeah. We're gonna kill Whitney.
- I know you will.

05:31.660 --> 05:34.420
Well, I gotta go.
I got rock climbing class next.

05:34.540 --> 05:37.260
- Cool. I have meditation coming up.
- Yeah?

05:38.340 --> 05:39.340
Love you.

05:56.100 --> 05:58.220
Eric Simmons, FBI.

05:58.300 --> 06:02.460
So you understand why we're here, right?
Would you mind answering a few questions?

06:04.900 --> 06:07.540
Well, thanks for your help.
It's gonna be okay.

06:07.620 --> 06:10.060
[Eric] Is there a place
where we can question him quietly?

06:10.140 --> 06:12.340
[Louis] All right,
we'll talk in my office.

06:12.420 --> 06:13.420
What?

06:14.500 --> 06:15.500
What's wrong?

06:16.580 --> 06:18.580
[softly] Are those people still there?

06:21.300 --> 06:23.100
No. Why? Who are...

06:24.980 --> 06:25.980
they?

06:27.660 --> 06:31.700
- Leo, I really don't have time for this.
- Trust me, you'll love it.

06:33.900 --> 06:35.620
[Hayley] Whoa! What is this place?

06:35.700 --> 06:37.500
Well, you said you needed
some privacy, right?

06:37.580 --> 06:39.860
This is where I go
when I need to be alone.

06:39.940 --> 06:42.700
Thanks, but you don't have to do this.

06:42.780 --> 06:44.340
Really. I'm fine.

06:49.700 --> 06:52.340
Okay. [chuckles] I better go.

06:52.420 --> 06:54.100
[playing classical melody]

06:59.060 --> 07:00.500
What is that?

07:00.580 --> 07:02.940
That is Bach. The world's first rocker.

07:03.740 --> 07:04.620
Interesting.

07:05.900 --> 07:08.900
- You want to be the next one?
- I don't play.

07:09.540 --> 07:12.260
It's okay. Here, come on. Try it.

07:13.380 --> 07:14.980
- Okay.
- All right, just sit down.

07:16.940 --> 07:18.380
Here. Take the guitar.

07:20.180 --> 07:22.180
All right, now, here, give me your hand.

07:23.460 --> 07:26.660
All right. Just put your fingers
there, there...

07:26.740 --> 07:29.340
See? That's an A chord.
A chord, this is Hayley.

07:29.420 --> 07:31.420
Nice to meet you, A chord.

07:31.500 --> 07:33.580
Are you ready to say goodbye
to your depression?

07:35.540 --> 07:36.540
Go for it.

07:37.300 --> 07:38.700
[strums guitar]

07:38.780 --> 07:40.180
Wow!

07:42.700 --> 07:44.660
The louder you play,
the better you'll feel.

07:44.740 --> 07:47.940
- You sure it's okay?
- Yeah, no one can hear a thing. Wait.

07:48.660 --> 07:50.500
[feedback humming]

07:51.300 --> 07:53.980
- [strumming guitar]
- Whoa!

07:56.180 --> 07:59.820
This is awesome!

08:01.340 --> 08:04.820
Whoo!

08:09.780 --> 08:11.540
[Daniel] Perfect timing, kid.

08:14.140 --> 08:16.100
- Have a seat.
- For what?

08:17.100 --> 08:18.260
Just sit down.

08:20.340 --> 08:22.860
We were just discussing
how to break into the Ravens clubhouse.

08:23.780 --> 08:25.340
Why... why would you do that?

08:25.420 --> 08:28.660
To wipe the smiles off their faces
after they won the opening challenge.

08:29.380 --> 08:32.220
Relax, okay? It's a Greenhouse tradition.

08:32.900 --> 08:35.460
The problem is that only a Raven's Louie
can open their door.

08:35.539 --> 08:37.059
And that's where you come in.

08:37.140 --> 08:38.140
Me?

08:39.299 --> 08:40.340
Mmm-hmm.

08:41.179 --> 08:43.780
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Look, this is a fake Louie.

08:43.860 --> 08:45.660
It's identical to the one
your sister carries.

08:45.740 --> 08:47.580
All you have to do is swap them
without her noticing.

08:49.140 --> 08:50.140
What?

08:50.980 --> 08:53.020
No, no. No way. I can't do this.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.620
- I told you so.
- Yeah.

08:55.420 --> 08:57.820
Well, algebra, here I come.
Who wants to study with me?

08:59.300 --> 09:00.300
I'll go.

09:02.700 --> 09:03.540
Wait.

09:06.380 --> 09:07.260
I'll do it.

09:07.340 --> 09:10.220
Way to go, kid.
See, that's what I'm talking about.

09:11.540 --> 09:15.020
- Now you sound like an Eagle. [chuckles]
- Mmm-hmm.

09:15.100 --> 09:17.580
You're a quick learner.
Now you know two chords,

09:17.660 --> 09:20.660
which means you can play 90%
of the songs ever written.

09:20.740 --> 09:22.660
- Really?
- No.

09:22.740 --> 09:23.780
- Oh.
- [chuckles]

09:26.380 --> 09:28.340
Listen, Leo. Thanks.

09:29.180 --> 09:30.660
I really needed this.

09:31.900 --> 09:32.900
Anytime, Woods.

09:36.180 --> 09:38.020
Your brother will be fine, you know.

09:38.980 --> 09:39.980
It's always hard at first.

09:40.820 --> 09:43.900
Yeah, it's a little bit more complicated
than that with me and my brother.

09:45.780 --> 09:47.300
I'll never forget that day.

09:48.300 --> 09:50.980
We all watched the landing
here at the cafeteria.

09:51.700 --> 09:54.700
It was the most terrifying silence
I ever heard.

09:55.940 --> 09:58.660
Everyone cried. Even Louis.

09:59.740 --> 10:01.980
I can't imagine what it was like for you.

10:05.860 --> 10:08.020
You know, the last time I saw her,

10:08.100 --> 10:10.900
I promised her I would take care
of my brother until she came back.

10:12.860 --> 10:14.660
Feels like I let her down.

10:16.740 --> 10:18.420
I think she'd be proud of you.

10:26.300 --> 10:27.380
Can I have some more?

10:29.140 --> 10:30.420
Just a bit more.

10:31.900 --> 10:34.100
And that's good. Thanks.

10:34.180 --> 10:35.180
One second.

10:41.220 --> 10:42.500
[Alex] My treat.

10:43.780 --> 10:45.700
- Could I leave this here?
- Sure.

10:50.140 --> 10:51.820
What is this, a bribe?

10:52.820 --> 10:54.460
More like a peace offering.

10:56.180 --> 10:59.100
- [laughs]
- Well, if it's chocolate, I'll accept.

11:01.940 --> 11:04.820
I wanted to apologize. I was upset.
I took it out on you...

11:04.900 --> 11:06.100
It's not your fault, Alex.

11:07.340 --> 11:09.580
I should've minded my own business.

11:10.980 --> 11:12.620
You're not a little boy anymore.

11:12.700 --> 11:15.260
- So we're cool?
- Of course we're cool.

11:15.860 --> 11:17.300
[both chuckle]

11:20.260 --> 11:22.220
[indistinct chatter]

11:22.300 --> 11:25.780
There he is. There he is. Hey, hey,
guy, guys, guys. Psst. He's here.

11:29.300 --> 11:30.300
[Parker] Well?

11:31.180 --> 11:32.780
[Daniel] You chickened out, didn't you?

11:33.380 --> 11:35.620
- So predictable.
- [scoffs] Let's go.

11:35.700 --> 11:37.740
- [Parker] We gotta do something.
- [Sophie] What do we do now?

11:37.860 --> 11:39.300
[Daniel sighs] We'll get
another Raven to do it.

11:39.380 --> 11:41.820
Ah... [clicks tongue]

11:42.980 --> 11:47.060
[laughs] I knew you could do it!

11:47.140 --> 11:49.900
- Yes!
- [all exclaiming]

11:51.700 --> 11:53.460
- [Brooke] This is gonna be so good.
- Way to go.

11:53.540 --> 11:54.860
[Sophie] Awesome!

11:56.380 --> 11:58.180
So, what are you going to do to 'em?

11:58.900 --> 12:01.100
"You"? You mean we.

12:02.300 --> 12:05.700
Let's just say we're gonna show them
what a little paint can do.

12:06.300 --> 12:08.540
- You're gonna love this.
- [Daniel] Good job.

12:09.660 --> 12:10.860
So you found nothing?

12:12.020 --> 12:13.740
I guess it's goodbye, then.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.700
We were thinking
we should interview the students.

12:15.780 --> 12:16.620
Absolutely not.

12:16.700 --> 12:18.820
Louis, we know the Taser
is here somewhere.

12:18.900 --> 12:21.420
How? You told me the GPS
stopped transmitting.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.740
I'm sorry, but unless
you have tangible evidence

12:23.820 --> 12:27.300
linking my students to that weapon,
you no longer have a reason to be here.

12:29.460 --> 12:30.780
Let's go, Perry.

12:37.260 --> 12:40.300
"How to build custom-made weapons."

12:40.380 --> 12:43.300
You know, now I know
why those FBI agents were here.

12:43.380 --> 12:46.340
- You smuggling arms, Miller?
- What? No! Never!

12:46.420 --> 12:49.540
You know, I knew there was something off
about you from the start. Now I get it.

12:49.620 --> 12:51.460
I... I can explain. It's Jackie.

12:52.860 --> 12:53.900
What about her?

12:55.660 --> 12:57.140
I don't know
if I should be telling you this,

12:57.220 --> 13:00.220
but I... I found something...
something personal.

13:00.300 --> 13:03.340
I didn't mean to knock over the punch,
but I scanned it and reprinted it.

13:03.420 --> 13:05.700
Not the punch, the sketchbook.
And then Jackie deleted all of it,

13:05.780 --> 13:08.620
but I saw something and it was weird.

13:10.140 --> 13:12.940
Why am I telling you this? Are you mad?

13:14.580 --> 13:17.100
I just want the last three minutes
of my life back.

13:17.820 --> 13:19.340
[knocking on door]

13:25.060 --> 13:26.740
Weird. My Louie isn't working.

13:26.820 --> 13:28.860
Been here less than a week
and you already broke it?

13:33.420 --> 13:34.900
[Perry] What exactly are we looking for?

13:34.980 --> 13:37.220
[Eric] Well, we know the ranger
didn't enter the Greenhouse,

13:37.300 --> 13:38.780
but somehow his Taser did.

13:38.860 --> 13:41.500
- [Perry] How?
- [Eric] Look, over there.

13:44.140 --> 13:45.220
What are you doing?

13:47.580 --> 13:48.940
Someone cut this open.

13:49.780 --> 13:51.700
Maybe it was a bobcat or a bear.

13:53.420 --> 13:55.660
Yeah... a bear.

13:55.740 --> 13:58.180
A bear who knew that this
was the exact spot on the perimeter

13:58.260 --> 14:00.940
with no surveillance cameras.
That kind of bear.

14:01.540 --> 14:04.180
Come on. Shh. Let's go.

14:05.340 --> 14:08.540
We have our evidence for Louis.
Now he has to let us investigate.

14:08.620 --> 14:09.860
- Come on.
- Yeah.

14:18.780 --> 14:21.740
Hey. Sorry what I said about your mom.

14:23.420 --> 14:24.940
It's okay. You didn't mean it.

14:26.140 --> 14:27.740
Yeah, but I shouldn't have said it anyway.

14:57.540 --> 14:58.540
[laughing]

14:59.260 --> 15:00.660
[snoring]

15:09.540 --> 15:11.980
The only way the park ranger's Taser
could've entered school grounds

15:12.060 --> 15:13.460
was through that hole in the fence.

15:13.540 --> 15:15.700
Since when do weapons travel on their own?

15:15.780 --> 15:17.700
They don't.
Someone came in here with the Taser.

15:17.780 --> 15:19.900
And whoever it is,
they know this place well.

15:19.980 --> 15:23.700
- Excuse me? How dare you!
- Look, this is a missing persons case.

15:23.780 --> 15:24.820
We can get a search warrant,

15:24.900 --> 15:26.980
and then you'll have a dozen policemen
swarming your school.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.500
- Is that what you want, Louis?
- What do you want, Eric?

15:29.580 --> 15:31.300
We need access to your student files.

15:32.180 --> 15:34.980
Could any of your students
have done something like this?

15:40.980 --> 15:42.060
[sighs]

15:52.260 --> 15:54.700
Captain? Captain?

15:54.780 --> 15:57.100
Max, what is it? What?

15:58.420 --> 15:59.420
Oh!

16:01.060 --> 16:02.860
The Eagles are gonna pay for this!

16:03.420 --> 16:04.420
What...

16:12.700 --> 16:14.740
[chuckles] Oh, no.

16:14.820 --> 16:16.060
What is it?

16:17.100 --> 16:18.100
What's wrong?

16:18.780 --> 16:20.020
What?

16:20.580 --> 16:22.580
- [Ravens laughing]
- Are you kidding me?

16:22.660 --> 16:25.460
What... what is this stuff?

16:26.100 --> 16:28.660
- [Hayley] Leo.
- What's going on here?

16:28.740 --> 16:30.460
Daniel has crossed the line.
Look at what they did.

16:30.540 --> 16:33.180
All right. All right. All right.
There's something more important.

16:33.260 --> 16:35.540
We're here for Jackie Sanders.
Does anyone know where she is?

16:57.380 --> 17:00.140
I've looked all over. Can't find her.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.100
Does anyone know where Jackie might be?

17:02.180 --> 17:04.780
Well, wherever she went, she obviously
did not shut the door behind her.

17:04.859 --> 17:08.180
Wow. Is this how you kids
maintain your rooms?

17:08.260 --> 17:10.060
Eric? What are you doing here?

17:10.140 --> 17:12.700
- We're actually here investigating a case.
- What case?

17:12.780 --> 17:15.420
A park ranger's missing.
We caught a signal off his Taser.

17:15.500 --> 17:19.619
- Has anyone here maybe seen anything or...
- Yeah. That's enough for now.

17:19.700 --> 17:21.380
So if you hear from Jackie,
you let us know.

17:22.380 --> 17:23.460
And clean this up.

17:24.660 --> 17:25.660
Come on.

17:28.420 --> 17:29.900
I look like a Ninja Turtle.

17:29.980 --> 17:32.580
- [Brooke laughs]
- No, no, no. Check this one!

17:32.660 --> 17:34.980
- [all] Oh!
- [Brooke] That's hilarious.

17:35.060 --> 17:36.460
[Sophie] I'm totally putting this
on my blog.

17:36.540 --> 17:37.660
- Yes, you have to.
- Yes!

17:37.740 --> 17:40.260
All right, everybody,
listen up, listen up, listen up!

17:40.860 --> 17:43.140
We all gave this guy
a hard time in the beginning.

17:43.780 --> 17:47.820
But he has proven himself
to be a true Eagle.

17:47.940 --> 17:48.940
To Alex.

17:49.620 --> 17:53.300
- [all] To Alex! Yeah!
- [chuckles]

17:53.380 --> 17:55.740
I hope you're all thinking of ways
to get back at the Eagles.

17:55.820 --> 17:57.940
How can you think about revenge
when Jackie is missing?

17:58.020 --> 17:59.740
She must be running away
from those FBI agents.

17:59.820 --> 18:02.660
Let's say she did. Doesn't it make sense
for someone like her?

18:02.740 --> 18:04.540
I mean, it doesn't mean
she did anything wrong.

18:04.620 --> 18:07.100
Max, didn't you say something
about Jackie's sketchbook?

18:07.180 --> 18:10.060
- You mean her drawings of hi-tech weapons?
- Were there Tasers?

18:14.900 --> 18:17.180
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Don't go into her bag!

18:17.260 --> 18:18.620
That's her personal stuff! Come on!

18:25.100 --> 18:28.380
- These sketches look suspicious.
- Hang on. Let's not jump to conclusions.

18:29.060 --> 18:31.500
Well, she did come here
in handcuffs the first day.

18:31.580 --> 18:33.580
- That's true.
- You're our captain.

18:33.660 --> 18:36.420
Don't you believe that everyone
is innocent until proven guilty?

18:38.540 --> 18:39.900
I don't know.

18:39.980 --> 18:42.020
You got to admit,
the timing is a bit suspicious.

18:43.140 --> 18:44.780
Hey, guys.

18:46.220 --> 18:47.540
Whoa!

18:47.620 --> 18:50.580
- You Ravens sure know how to party.
- [Leo] Where were you?

18:53.060 --> 18:54.940
You went surfing before dawn?

18:55.020 --> 18:57.300
- Best time to surf.
- Why did you leave our door open?

18:57.380 --> 18:59.060
What's with all the questions?

19:01.060 --> 19:02.700
You think I did this?

19:04.740 --> 19:07.660
"June, 2015.
Breaking and entering a bakery.

19:07.740 --> 19:10.580
January, 2016. Insulting a police officer.

19:10.660 --> 19:13.220
April, 2016.
Breaking and entering a bank."

19:13.300 --> 19:15.020
- Shall I go on?
- What, there's more?

19:15.700 --> 19:18.900
- What does this have to do with anything?
- What were you doing out so early?

19:18.980 --> 19:20.860
I told you. I was surfing.

19:20.940 --> 19:23.260
Jackie, this is awkward for all of us,

19:23.340 --> 19:26.860
but the FBI are just investigating
a missing Taser from a park ranger

19:26.940 --> 19:29.060
who disappeared from the area
several weeks ago.

19:29.140 --> 19:32.740
- What does that have to do with me?
- We found your art.

19:34.620 --> 19:37.020
Oh... right.

19:38.260 --> 19:39.740
Thanks for believing in me.

19:39.820 --> 19:42.340
No one's accusing you of anything.
They're just trying...

19:42.420 --> 19:45.180
We brushed the fence.
Jackie's fingerprints were everywhere.

19:45.260 --> 19:47.100
I told you, I took the shortcut.

19:47.180 --> 19:49.500
Then you won't mind
taking a polygraph test.

19:49.580 --> 19:51.460
You know, to prove
that you're telling us the truth.

19:53.300 --> 19:55.020
- I won't do it.
- Excuse me?

19:55.100 --> 19:57.500
If you don't take the test,
I'll be forced to arrest you.

19:57.580 --> 19:58.460
Hold on.

19:59.380 --> 20:01.300
Jackie, I know you're innocent.

20:01.380 --> 20:03.500
Just take the test,
and they'll leave you alone.

20:04.460 --> 20:06.140
No, they won't.

20:06.220 --> 20:08.780
They've already convicted me
because of my past.

20:08.860 --> 20:11.260
There's nothing I can do
now or in the future

20:11.340 --> 20:12.900
to make them change their minds.

20:13.620 --> 20:15.420
You might as well arrest me now.

20:21.340 --> 20:22.380
[Leo] Where are you taking her?

20:23.100 --> 20:25.220
- [Eric] Back to headquarters.
- What? Why?

20:25.780 --> 20:29.700
- I refused to take the lie detector test.
- It's still not too late, Jackie.

20:29.780 --> 20:32.700
It is. What's the use?
To them, I'm already guilty.

20:32.780 --> 20:34.220
Okay, that's enough, guys.

20:35.020 --> 20:37.860
Wait, Eric. If you want to give her
the lie detector test,

20:37.940 --> 20:39.740
- you have to give it to me first.
- What?

20:39.820 --> 20:43.100
- Hayley, you don't have to do that.
- Who says I'm not the criminal?

20:43.660 --> 20:46.180
It's kind of careless
not to check all the students, right?

20:46.740 --> 20:49.660
That's it. All of you,
go back to your clubhouse, please.

20:49.740 --> 20:50.900
I want to take the test, too.

20:50.980 --> 20:53.180
Right, there should be
a control group for this experiment.

20:53.260 --> 20:54.340
I'll take the test, too.

20:55.140 --> 20:57.300
Me, too. It's not dangerous, is it?

20:59.540 --> 21:01.020
You heard them, Eric.

21:07.660 --> 21:10.420
[Eric] Your dad would kill me if he knew
I was interrogating you right now.

21:14.420 --> 21:16.860
Have you come in contact
with any suspicious devices

21:16.940 --> 21:19.060
- in the past few months?
- No.

21:19.140 --> 21:20.580
Do you know anything
about the missing Taser?

21:22.060 --> 21:23.820
- No.
- [laptop beeps]

21:26.380 --> 21:28.660
- We're good. Mmm-hmm.
- That's it?

21:28.740 --> 21:30.140
- We're done?
- Yep.

21:30.220 --> 21:32.260
So, talk to your dad often?

21:33.860 --> 21:35.100
Yeah. Why?

21:35.700 --> 21:38.700
I visited him a few days ago.
You know I love him, right?

21:38.780 --> 21:40.620
[sighs] Yeah, I know.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.540
Yeah, we miss your dad at the bureau.

21:43.180 --> 21:46.740
[sighs] Well, too bad you didn't think
about that before you kicked him out.

22:06.620 --> 22:08.020
- [Daniel] Hey, there.
- Hey.

22:09.420 --> 22:10.420
Mmm.

22:10.940 --> 22:12.780
If Jackie really was hiding something,

22:12.860 --> 22:15.660
do you think she would be so careless
to leave her fingerprints behind?

22:16.340 --> 22:17.500
[laptop beeps]

22:17.580 --> 22:20.540
Look, I don't know Jackie that well,
but I know I believe her.

22:20.620 --> 22:23.940
Can you explain this?

22:29.980 --> 22:30.980
Wait.

22:33.020 --> 22:34.500
I recognize this one.

22:36.020 --> 22:38.300
These aren't real weapons.
No wonder I couldn't find them online.

22:38.380 --> 22:40.700
This is a replica
of a cybernetic coma ray gun.

22:40.780 --> 22:43.740
It's from a video game we like to play.
It's a really impressive copy, too.

22:43.820 --> 22:46.220
She actually even included
the subsonic magnetic trigger.

22:47.900 --> 22:51.140
- [sighs] I'm going for a quick run.
- Can I join you?

22:51.700 --> 22:54.260
Actually, I kinda need to clear my mind.

22:55.620 --> 22:56.620
Love you.

23:26.660 --> 23:28.220
[Eric] Have you ever seen this?

23:28.300 --> 23:29.300
- No.
- [laptop beeps]

23:29.380 --> 23:30.980
Have you ever heard anyone talk about it?

23:31.540 --> 23:33.100
- No.
- [laptop beeps]

23:35.340 --> 23:36.780
Do you know where it is?

23:38.540 --> 23:40.380
- No.
- [laptop beeps]
