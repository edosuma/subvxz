WEBVTT

00:01.035 --> 00:03.471
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Yo!

00:03.537 --> 00:06.974
Hey.
Hey.

00:07.041 --> 00:09.043
So, my neighbor
had this on his porch.

00:09.110 --> 00:10.244
It's supposed to be
Buzz Lightyear,

00:10.311 --> 00:12.780
but tell me
who this looks like.

00:12.846 --> 00:13.981
Buzz Lightyear.

00:14.048 --> 00:15.083
No!

00:15.149 --> 00:16.517
Come on.
It looks like you.

00:16.584 --> 00:17.818
Me?
Yes!

00:17.885 --> 00:19.653
I get...
I'm getting Kyle.
I don't get me.

00:19.720 --> 00:20.821
Oh, stop it.
Yes!

00:20.888 --> 00:22.256
Anyway, take it.

00:22.323 --> 00:24.058
I don't want pumpkin-Kevin
pointed at my window

00:24.125 --> 00:25.193
when I'm in the bathroom.

00:25.259 --> 00:26.827
Believe me,

00:26.894 --> 00:28.162
pumpkin-Kevin
doesn't want that, either.
All right.

00:28.229 --> 00:30.198
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Yo! Come in!

00:30.264 --> 00:32.533
Hey, neighbor!
KEVIN: Hey!

00:32.600 --> 00:33.767
Hi!

00:33.834 --> 00:34.902
It's Tuesday.

00:34.968 --> 00:36.104
You know what that means.

00:36.170 --> 00:39.006
Lasagna!
Lasagna!

00:39.073 --> 00:41.175
Oh, hey, did you
remember to goose up
the cheese a little bit

00:41.242 --> 00:42.343
and just pump the brakes
on the garlic?

00:42.410 --> 00:43.811
Of course I did, silly.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.146
I listen.

00:45.213 --> 00:46.480
The girls in my spin class

00:46.547 --> 00:48.015
say I never listen,
and I talk too much,

00:48.082 --> 00:49.450
but I don't really
think that's...
Thank you!

00:49.517 --> 00:50.818
You're such an angel
and so great.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.220
Hello.
Hi.

00:52.286 --> 00:53.654
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:53.721 --> 00:55.489
Uh, Wendy, this is Vanessa.
She's my business partner.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.325
This is Wendy,
best cook on Seville Lane.

00:57.391 --> 00:59.527
Oh,
I don't know about that.

00:59.593 --> 01:00.828
Oh, please.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.597
Anyway, if you have any more
tweaks on the lasagna,

01:03.664 --> 01:04.932
give me a yingle.

01:04.998 --> 01:06.300
All right.
Will do.

01:06.367 --> 01:07.601
Hey, by the way,
if some of your beef stew

01:07.668 --> 01:09.103
showed up Sunday
for the football game,

01:09.170 --> 01:11.739
I wouldn't pass on it.

01:11.805 --> 01:14.074
Pass. Football.
Yeah.

01:14.142 --> 01:15.509
He is so clever.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.845
So clever.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.680
Buh-bye!
All right.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.016
She is awesome.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.852
You got all the women
on the block cooking for you?

01:24.918 --> 01:26.554
She knows
I'm a single parent.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.222
She brings over
a little food.

01:28.289 --> 01:30.158
Some people think it's nice
to help out a little.

01:30.224 --> 01:31.425
Hey.
Hey.

01:31.492 --> 01:33.127
(SCOFFS)
Wendy was here again?

01:33.194 --> 01:35.229
Dad,
you've got to end this.
End what?

01:35.296 --> 01:37.131
You know exactly what.

01:37.198 --> 01:38.666
She's totally into you.
Yes!

01:38.732 --> 01:42.903
"Any tweaks to the lasagna,
give me a yingle."

01:42.970 --> 01:46.707
I think we all know
she wasn't talking about
tweaking the lasagna.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.276
She's just being nice
to our family.

01:48.342 --> 01:50.744
Wendy wore Spanx
to deliver ziti last week.

01:50.811 --> 01:53.147
I don't care if she wore
newspaper on fire.

01:53.214 --> 01:55.549
All I see is the ziti.

01:55.616 --> 02:00.488
* I am not your
ordinary guy *

02:01.054 --> 02:02.323
Yams, yams.

02:02.390 --> 02:03.524
Guys, where...
where do we keep the yams?

02:03.591 --> 02:05.159
Isn't a yam
just a sweet potato?

02:05.226 --> 02:06.394
No, no, huge difference.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.862
One is very sweet
and potato-y.

02:08.929 --> 02:10.030
That's your, uh...

02:10.097 --> 02:11.199
That's the sweet potato.

02:11.265 --> 02:12.766
The other...

02:12.833 --> 02:14.602
The other is... It's more...
Yeah, it's got a yammy...

02:14.668 --> 02:17.238
It's yam.
It's a yam substance,
so it's yam.

02:17.305 --> 02:18.339
All right?

02:18.406 --> 02:19.707
Oh, hey, guys,
uh, listen,

02:19.773 --> 02:21.575
any special requests
for Thanksgiving?

02:21.642 --> 02:23.211
Dad, actually,
we were talking,

02:23.277 --> 02:24.445
and we thought, you know,

02:24.512 --> 02:26.046
maybe this year
for Thanksgiving,

02:26.113 --> 02:27.515
we'd go out to eat.

02:27.581 --> 02:29.950
What? You cra...
Whose idea was this...

02:30.017 --> 02:31.051
Is it the new guy?

02:31.118 --> 02:32.586
No.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.922
Look, I know this is gonna be
difficult without mom,

02:34.988 --> 02:37.925
but, hey, we still have
a lot to be thankful for,
all right?

02:37.991 --> 02:39.260
And every year,

02:39.327 --> 02:40.160
we have a big dinner
right here at home.

02:40.228 --> 02:41.695
It's tradition.

02:41.762 --> 02:43.297
Let's just go out to dinner.
It'll be so much easier.

02:43.364 --> 02:44.665
And, plus,
I have so much school.

02:44.732 --> 02:45.533
I can't help you.

02:45.599 --> 02:46.800
I don't need your help.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.536
I'm gonna make
the whole thing myself

02:48.602 --> 02:50.103
with these hands right here
and a whole lot of love.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.405
Now, who's with me?
Come on!

02:51.472 --> 02:53.874
I can make Scotch eggs
with curry mayo.

02:53.941 --> 02:56.109
I'm gonna pretend that
I didn't even hear that.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.211
I can make the cornbread.

02:57.278 --> 02:58.646
Boom, Sara! There you go!

02:58.712 --> 03:00.814
That's the Thanksgiving spirit
right there.

03:00.881 --> 03:03.551
Thanksgiving spirit.
That's not a thing.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.085
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no.

03:05.152 --> 03:06.687
It's definitely a thing,
okay?

03:06.754 --> 03:08.889
(CHUCKLES)
That's a common misconception.

03:08.956 --> 03:11.392
Kids...

03:11.459 --> 03:14.628
The spirit of Thanksgiving
is actually the spirit
of the Pilgrims

03:14.695 --> 03:16.029
coming together
with the Indians

03:16.096 --> 03:18.966
to celebrate the harvest
of the Fall bounty.

03:19.032 --> 03:23.136
They did it by bringing corn
and turkey to the villagers,

03:23.203 --> 03:24.405
who had potatoes,

03:24.472 --> 03:25.806
and they would mash them
out of anger

03:25.873 --> 03:27.875
'cause they were so upset,
at first,

03:27.941 --> 03:30.010
but then it turned
to mashing out of love.

03:30.077 --> 03:31.812
And they said, uh...

03:31.879 --> 03:34.648
in Indian,
they said, "Thanks."

03:34.715 --> 03:37.217
And then...
Then, in Pilgrim, said,

03:37.285 --> 03:38.552
"You know,
we're just giving to you,"

03:38.619 --> 03:39.953
and they said...
Snd that was it...

03:40.020 --> 03:41.555
"Thanks" and "Giving,"
and it came together,

03:41.622 --> 03:43.824
and that's what created
Thanksgiving.

03:45.626 --> 03:48.262
I'm not gonna lie.
I get a little lost there,
yeah.

03:49.397 --> 03:51.565
Does your dad like me?

03:51.632 --> 03:53.401
Of course he does.
Why?

03:53.467 --> 03:54.568
I don't know.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.404
I just thought
that after the wedding,

03:56.470 --> 03:58.806
I'd see a change
in our relationship.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.140
Yeah. Like what?

04:00.207 --> 04:03.477
Ideally...we'd have one?

04:03.544 --> 04:06.146
I mean, shouldn't
we be hanging out,

04:06.213 --> 04:08.048
calling each other
nicknames,

04:08.115 --> 04:09.883
and making eye contact?

04:10.884 --> 04:12.252
Nicknames?

04:12.320 --> 04:13.454
Like what?

04:13.521 --> 04:15.255
Uh, I don't know.
Uh...

04:15.323 --> 04:16.990
Chale-y?

04:17.791 --> 04:19.059
K-Bizzle?

04:19.126 --> 04:20.294
Mm...

04:20.361 --> 04:21.895
Yeah, no nicknames.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.897
Well,
I've got to do something.
We're family!

04:23.964 --> 04:26.099
I'm gonna sire
his grandchildren.

04:26.166 --> 04:27.635
Okay.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.970
Definitely do not mention
"siring" in front of him.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.171
You know what I mean.

04:31.238 --> 04:32.573
I'm his son-in-law.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.308
I should at least be able
to call him "dad."

04:34.375 --> 04:37.345
Well, why don't you try
just bonding with him,
you know?

04:37.411 --> 04:38.546
Guy stuff.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.314
Watching a football game.

04:40.381 --> 04:41.682
Share a couple of beers,

04:41.749 --> 04:44.485
and we can talk about
hot sauce and cuts of meat.

04:44.552 --> 04:45.953
Yeah, and then you just,

04:46.019 --> 04:47.421
you know, you slip a "dad" in
under your breath.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.222
Done, done, done!
Done. Okay.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.724
Like this.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.125
"Whoa!

04:52.192 --> 04:55.796
"This piece of prosciutto
really has some kick, Daddio."

04:55.863 --> 04:57.731
Yes! Yes. Exactly!

04:57.798 --> 04:58.666
That's great.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.000
But if you go
with "daddio,"

05:00.067 --> 05:01.702
make sure you're like
five feet away,

05:01.769 --> 05:03.604
because he will lunge
at you.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.576
(EXHALES)

05:09.276 --> 05:11.445
(POT CLANGING)

05:13.113 --> 05:14.314
Hey.
Hey.

05:14.382 --> 05:15.516
I brought you
your paycheck.

05:15.583 --> 05:17.851
What are you doing?
Oh, thanks.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.620
I am prepping
for Thanksgiving tomorrow

05:19.687 --> 05:22.189
and changing the way
America peels potatoes.

05:22.255 --> 05:23.256
Check it out.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.959
(MOTOR WHIRRING)

05:27.761 --> 05:29.029
Okay.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.534
There we go.

05:33.601 --> 05:36.870
That one came off.
That's all right.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.005
It's okay.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.046
Those are the little
cherry potatoes.

05:46.113 --> 05:47.648
Okay.
One of the...

05:49.550 --> 05:52.620
Meet the Kevin Gable
Tater Turner, huh?

05:52.686 --> 05:54.422
You get it? It's like
the George Foreman Grill.

05:54.488 --> 05:57.090
Yes. Only stupid.

05:57.157 --> 05:58.892
I'm telling you,
this thing's gonna
spread like crazy

05:58.959 --> 06:00.027
across the country.

06:00.093 --> 06:01.328
Everybody's gonna want one.

06:01.395 --> 06:02.696
All right, well,
put me down for none.

06:02.763 --> 06:05.232
Okay.
Come on.
Just lose the drill.

06:05.298 --> 06:06.634
Let me help you.
No.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.335
Look, I invited you tomorrow
as a guest,

06:08.402 --> 06:10.070
and that's what you are,
a guest, all right?
All right.

06:10.137 --> 06:11.539
I appreciate it,
but I don't need the help.

06:11.605 --> 06:12.873
Listen, I, I get it.

06:12.940 --> 06:15.476
This is the first Thanksgiving
that...

06:15.543 --> 06:17.545
that you're taking care of,

06:17.611 --> 06:18.979
but let me just help you,
okay?

06:19.046 --> 06:20.848
It's a lot more work
than you think.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.650
Okay, can I tell you
who had a lot more work

06:22.716 --> 06:24.051
than they thought?
Who?

06:24.117 --> 06:27.688
Little group
I like to call the Pilgrims.

06:27.755 --> 06:29.823
Did you know that once
they debarked the Mayflower,

06:29.890 --> 06:31.459
you know what they did?
What'd they do?

06:31.525 --> 06:32.593
They got after it.
Mm.

06:32.660 --> 06:34.127
Yes.
They got after it.

06:34.194 --> 06:35.663
They rolled up their little
black-and-white sleeves,

06:35.729 --> 06:37.030
they tightened
their massive belt buckle

06:37.097 --> 06:38.566
and their shoe buckle
and the hat buckle,

06:38.632 --> 06:41.034
all the buckles
were tightened up,

06:41.101 --> 06:44.304
and they laid
the foundation of unity,

06:44.371 --> 06:45.839
which was then interwoven

06:45.906 --> 06:48.375
into the very fabric
of our lives.

06:48.442 --> 06:51.211
Okay.
You know that last part
was a cotton commercial?

06:51.278 --> 06:53.213
Yeah, that came
from the Pilgrims.
Did it?

06:53.280 --> 06:54.815
Yeah.
Okay.

06:55.816 --> 06:56.850
Okay.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.920
Food is prepped,
decorations are done.

06:59.987 --> 07:01.455
I am killin' this.

07:01.522 --> 07:03.323
You make it all look
so easy...

07:03.390 --> 07:04.892
K-Geezy.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.094
What was that?

07:08.395 --> 07:09.497
I said...
(DOORBELL RINGS)

07:09.563 --> 07:10.864
Oh, thank God.

07:14.702 --> 07:16.136
That's me, that's me!

07:16.203 --> 07:18.005
What? What's this?

07:18.071 --> 07:19.740
Since when
do you get packages?

07:19.807 --> 07:22.776
I got a gift card
for my birthday.

07:22.843 --> 07:25.579
To Wild Willy's
Survival Outpost?

07:25.646 --> 07:28.448
Road flares,
water purification tablets...

07:28.516 --> 07:30.684
What is all this stuff?

07:30.751 --> 07:34.888
Well, we're getting hit
with a big storm tomorrow,

07:34.955 --> 07:36.890
so we're gonna need it
to survive.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.192
All right, Jack, you're acting
a little crazy here.
What's happening, bud?

07:39.259 --> 07:41.094
Oh, not crazy, prepared.

07:41.161 --> 07:43.764
Remember when
I did that report on
Yellowstone National Park?

07:43.831 --> 07:46.033
No, but let's say
that I did.

07:46.099 --> 07:49.503
Well, it turns out
that it's a supervolcano,

07:49.570 --> 07:51.004
and when that thing blows,

07:51.071 --> 07:53.006
a toxic cloud of ash
will cover the Earth.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.608
It's gonna be
every man for himself.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.644
We're talking looting,
cannibalism...

07:56.710 --> 07:58.311
Okay, bud, bud...

07:58.378 --> 08:02.049
Buddy, none of that stuff
is gonna happen, all right?

08:02.115 --> 08:04.317
And I promise you,
if it does,

08:04.384 --> 08:06.453
and we get hungry
enough...

08:06.520 --> 08:07.921
we'll just eat Chale.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.877
KENDRA: Hey, Dad?

08:29.943 --> 08:31.178
What's up?

08:31.244 --> 08:32.345
It's already dead.

08:32.412 --> 08:34.414
You don't have
to humiliate it.

08:34.481 --> 08:35.749
Okay.

08:35.816 --> 08:37.818
Look, it's called tenderizing,
all right?

08:37.885 --> 08:40.353
Okay, one last try,
from your family.

08:40.420 --> 08:42.556
Are you sure you don't want
to just go to a restaurant?

08:42.623 --> 08:43.891
Absolutely not.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.693
All right, fine.
Well, then,
let me help you.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.094
I can put off studying
for a couple hours.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.996
No, hey, I don't need
your help, all right?

08:49.062 --> 08:50.831
Just get ready
to see the magic.

08:50.898 --> 08:51.965
All right,
well, you know,

08:52.032 --> 08:53.734
before you put that
in the oven,

08:53.801 --> 08:55.603
you might want
to cut that string
and pull the giblets out.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.372
It's all
part of the magic.

08:59.439 --> 09:01.308
I have my process.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.176
What I do first
is I befriend the bird,
much like the Pilgrims di...

09:03.243 --> 09:05.445
No, no, no, no, no, no.

09:05.512 --> 09:06.914
No more Pilgrim stories.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.616
You're on your own.
Good luck.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.884
Don't need luck.

09:13.286 --> 09:14.988
Ugh.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.725
I'm very sorry about this.

09:20.127 --> 09:22.229
Here we go. Okay.

09:22.295 --> 09:23.597
(MUTTERS)

09:23.664 --> 09:25.232
Oh.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.005
(GROANS)

09:33.907 --> 09:36.009
(TURKEY SQUISHES)

09:36.076 --> 09:38.011
(COUGHS)

09:39.747 --> 09:41.214
Come on.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.222
(MOTOR WHIRRING)

09:50.924 --> 09:53.093
There we go.
There we go.

09:53.460 --> 09:54.895
Oh.

10:05.706 --> 10:08.642
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
It's... It's open!

10:08.709 --> 10:10.443
Gobble, gobble!

10:10.510 --> 10:12.445
Oh. Hey, Wendy.

10:12.512 --> 10:14.715
(SOFTLY) Oh, man.
I brought you
a little pecan pie.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.316
Oh, thank you.

10:16.383 --> 10:17.584
You didn't have to do that.

10:17.651 --> 10:18.819
I wanted to. I...

10:18.886 --> 10:20.520
Listen,
I got to tell you, Wendy,

10:20.587 --> 10:22.522
you're an amazing cook,
and thank you so much
for doing all this,

10:22.589 --> 10:24.658
but I, I really
need to talk to you
about something.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.126
What happened there?

10:26.193 --> 10:28.361
Oh, I was...

10:28.428 --> 10:30.130
I was just trying
to get the giblets out,

10:30.197 --> 10:31.799
and it kind of
got away from me.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.566
Let me help you
with this.
Oh, look.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.035
You really don't have
to do that.

10:35.102 --> 10:36.336
(GRUNTS)

10:38.772 --> 10:40.440
Ah! Whoop!

10:40.507 --> 10:41.675
It's a boy.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.076
(CHUCKLES)
You know what?

10:43.143 --> 10:44.845
I had a little trouble
balancing things,

10:44.912 --> 10:46.747
but I got to tell you,
I think I got it
covered now, but...

10:46.814 --> 10:49.649
You know what?
Why don't you let me
help you with this?

10:50.083 --> 10:51.118
(SIGHS)

10:51.184 --> 10:52.686
You've done enough.
I, I can't...

10:52.753 --> 10:53.954
You what it is
I also did?

10:54.021 --> 10:55.522
I already told my kids

10:55.588 --> 10:57.624
I was gonna cook
the Thanksgiving dinner...
Oh. Oh.

10:57.691 --> 10:59.860
...and I told them
the whole story
about the Pilgrims

10:59.927 --> 11:01.161
and everything
and how they came...

11:01.228 --> 11:02.662
Do you know that story,
by the way?

11:02.730 --> 11:04.164
Oh, sure.
Okay.

11:05.632 --> 11:07.768
You know what I could do?

11:07.835 --> 11:09.937
I could cook
the whole meal
at my house,

11:10.003 --> 11:11.638
you leave
the back door open,

11:11.705 --> 11:12.840
and I'll sneak the food in,

11:12.906 --> 11:15.008
and guess which Pilgrim
cooked dinner?

11:15.075 --> 11:17.010
This one?
Mm-hmm.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.215
My dad said
you wanted to talk to me?

11:22.282 --> 11:24.284
Grab a seat, Jacky boy.
(CLEARS THROAT)

11:24.351 --> 11:27.487
Well, if this is about me
making fun of your mustache,
I'm sorry.

11:27.554 --> 11:28.856
That's okay.

11:28.922 --> 11:30.623
It's just that
it barely grows in,

11:30.690 --> 11:31.892
the hair is so thin...

11:31.959 --> 11:34.194
Yeah, Jack...

11:34.261 --> 11:36.596
It's not about
my mustache, okay?

11:36.663 --> 11:38.098
It is about you

11:38.165 --> 11:40.233
thinking the world
is going to end.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.035
It is.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.603
Since the beginning
of time,

11:43.670 --> 11:45.305
people have been predicting
oblivion.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.875
Well, you know that
Yellowstone National Park

11:47.941 --> 11:49.709
is a supervolcano, right?

11:49.777 --> 11:53.313
Yes, I've heard
that old chestnut.

11:53.380 --> 11:56.349
Well, it's supposed to blow
every 60 million years.

11:56.416 --> 11:57.785
It's been 65.

11:57.851 --> 12:00.788
Mnh, mnh, that
doesn't sound quite right.

12:00.854 --> 12:03.256
What crazy website
did you get that one from?

12:03.323 --> 12:04.792
New York Times.

12:05.759 --> 12:07.627
Oh.
Yeah.

12:07.694 --> 12:09.997
So, any minute now...

12:10.063 --> 12:11.765
(IMITATES VOLCANO ERUPTING)

12:14.768 --> 12:17.037
ANNOUNCER: And that is why
the family is grateful

12:17.104 --> 12:18.538
to have such a plentiful meal

12:18.605 --> 12:21.708
on the happiest day
of the year, Thanksgiving.

12:21.775 --> 12:23.743
Is this the video that Dad
made us watch every year?

12:23.811 --> 12:24.878
We hated this thing.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.146
Yeah, we hated it,

12:26.213 --> 12:27.547
and now my kids
will hate it, okay?

12:27.614 --> 12:29.682
It's called tradition.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.284
Well, I, for one,
enjoyed the part

12:31.351 --> 12:33.253
where they said,
"Thank you, father,"

12:33.320 --> 12:36.223
or, in modern terms,
"Thank you, dad."

12:37.657 --> 12:39.559
All right, I'm gonna get
started on the cornbread.

12:39.626 --> 12:40.861
No, no, no, no.

12:40.928 --> 12:42.796
Nobody in the kitchen
right now, okay?

12:42.863 --> 12:44.064
Dad, what are you
talking about?

12:44.131 --> 12:46.166
It's not done...
It's almost there.

12:46.233 --> 12:47.935
I'm just waiting
for the button
on the turkey to pop.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.336
Let's just watch the movie.
Come on.

12:53.473 --> 12:54.942
(SHIVERS)

12:58.378 --> 13:00.047
(EXHALES)

13:04.484 --> 13:06.719
Oh. Hello.
Hey.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.655
Uh, is, is Kevin here?

13:08.721 --> 13:11.724
I have some, uh,
spare treats.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.160
Yes, he is, actually.

13:13.226 --> 13:14.627
But, but, Wendy,
could I, um...

13:14.694 --> 13:15.996
Can I...
Can I talk to you
for a second?

13:16.063 --> 13:17.230
Sure.
Yeah. Okay.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.966
Sure.
Cool. Look, I, um...

13:19.032 --> 13:20.367
I know you love
helping people

13:20.433 --> 13:22.335
and doing the whole thing
with Kevin

13:22.402 --> 13:24.471
where you're...
you're cooking for him,

13:24.537 --> 13:25.705
and that's very sweet.

13:25.772 --> 13:27.607
Oh. Thank you.
Yeah.

13:27.674 --> 13:29.742
But here's the thing.
Um...

13:29.809 --> 13:32.980
You know those animals
that can't sense
when they're full,

13:33.046 --> 13:36.483
so they just eat and eat
and eat and eat,

13:36.549 --> 13:38.385
and then they just explode?

13:38.451 --> 13:40.854
You know what I mean?
That's Kevin.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.122
That's weird.
Yeah.

13:42.189 --> 13:43.991
So, what I'm trying to say
is, um...

13:44.057 --> 13:45.258
I don't want
to see you get hurt,

13:45.325 --> 13:47.027
because you're
a very sweet person.

13:47.094 --> 13:49.897
But I just...
I just think, as long
as you're feeding him,

13:49.963 --> 13:52.199
he's not gonna
tell you the truth.

13:52.265 --> 13:53.867
I see.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.335
So, before this
got any further,

13:55.402 --> 13:57.037
I just wanted
to kind of help you

13:57.104 --> 13:59.006
and just nip this in the bud,
you know?

13:59.072 --> 14:00.440
You like him.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.709
You're trying to discourage me
from liking him,

14:02.775 --> 14:04.077
because you like him.

14:04.144 --> 14:06.746
Okay. Couldn't be further
from the truth.

14:06.813 --> 14:08.248
Now, did you hear
the whole part

14:08.315 --> 14:10.283
about the exploding animal,
or...

14:11.851 --> 14:13.820
Oh, I heard.

14:13.887 --> 14:16.156
Now hear this, skank.

14:18.558 --> 14:19.626
Skank.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.061
Okay.
We're doing this?

14:21.128 --> 14:23.030
I've been trying
to open this pickle jar

14:23.096 --> 14:24.464
for 10 months now.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.633
I'm not about to walk away
before the lid pops.

14:26.699 --> 14:27.867
You feel me?

14:27.935 --> 14:30.237
The other side of Wendy.
I like it.

14:30.303 --> 14:31.905
I didn't love
the "skank" thing,

14:31.972 --> 14:33.306
so here's
what's gonna happen.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.774
You're gonna take
your little cooler, okay?

14:34.841 --> 14:36.209
And you're gonna
hit the bricks,

14:36.276 --> 14:37.444
or you're gonna see
the other side of Vanessa.

14:38.511 --> 14:40.580
Listen, I really think
I should...

14:40.647 --> 14:42.715
You're gonna take the cooler,
and you're gonna
hit the bricks, Wendy.

14:42.782 --> 14:44.317
I think Kevin's gonna...

14:44.384 --> 14:47.454
You're gonna take the cooler,
and hit the bricks, Wendy!

14:48.021 --> 14:49.923
(WIND HOWLING)

14:55.095 --> 14:56.296
Was that...
Was that Wendy?

14:56.363 --> 14:58.365
Yes, and I sent her packing.

14:59.132 --> 15:00.300
Why would you do that?

15:00.367 --> 15:01.868
Because you were
never gonna do it,

15:01.935 --> 15:03.937
so I took care of
"bidness."

15:04.004 --> 15:05.405
You're welcome.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.275
We agreed to talk
after she dropped off

15:08.341 --> 15:10.243
all the food
for Thanksgiving.

15:10.877 --> 15:12.312
Oh.

15:12.980 --> 15:14.347
Yes.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.486
All right, guys,
bring it in. Listen up.

15:19.552 --> 15:22.089
Uh, I had things
all worked out in there,

15:22.155 --> 15:24.457
and if everything
was left to me,

15:24.524 --> 15:26.226
we'd be knuckle-deep
in gravy right now.

15:26.293 --> 15:31.264
But that plan has derailed,
Vanessa.

15:31.331 --> 15:32.832
So I just think
we're gonna go out
to a restaurant.

15:32.899 --> 15:34.034
All right?
Let's just do it.

15:34.101 --> 15:35.635
Oh, no, Dad. Storm hit.
We can't go out.

15:35.702 --> 15:37.304
It's a state of emergency.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.439
No, no, no, no.
Fire department
would've called me.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.374
Ah. Phone's dead.

15:41.441 --> 15:44.577
Anybody got a charger?
iPhone 4?

15:44.644 --> 15:47.247
4? iPhone 4?

15:49.249 --> 15:50.917
All right, I better split.

15:50.984 --> 15:54.087
Wait, so, basically,
we're stuck here
with nothing to eat?

15:54.154 --> 15:55.788
I can still make
the cornbread!

15:55.855 --> 15:57.057
All right,
there you go, great.

15:57.124 --> 15:58.391
And I got a case full
of pork rinds,

15:58.458 --> 16:00.227
so we're, we're
looking good, okay.

16:01.161 --> 16:02.996
Oh, good.
Power's out.

16:03.063 --> 16:04.531
And so it begins.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.900
I'm scared, Dad.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.570
Did Chale just call me "dad"?

16:12.339 --> 16:14.074
I don't know what to do.
You know?

16:14.141 --> 16:15.408
And I went
back and forth.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.010
I knew this...
(STUTTERS)

16:17.077 --> 16:18.911
it wasn't getting
any better,

16:18.978 --> 16:20.347
so I had to
make a decision,

16:20.413 --> 16:22.149
and I was
running out of time.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.151
And it's in those moments
that you...

16:24.217 --> 16:26.386
You realize who,
who you are, you know?

16:26.453 --> 16:28.055
And, I, uh...

16:28.121 --> 16:30.657
I did it.
I stepped up,
and I, uh...

16:30.723 --> 16:32.859
I pulled the trigger...

16:32.925 --> 16:34.461
and bought a new pillow.

16:37.197 --> 16:38.631
Memory foam,
it changed my life.

16:40.233 --> 16:42.235
Anybody else got a story?
Who's up?

16:42.302 --> 16:44.771
Dad, we're sitting
in the dark. This sucks.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.839
I can't believe I didn't get
to make my cornbread.

16:46.906 --> 16:48.208
Oh, Sara,
don't mention food.

16:48.275 --> 16:49.509
I'm starving.

16:49.576 --> 16:50.943
If you had just
let me in the kitchen,

16:51.010 --> 16:52.279
then I could've
made my cornbread,

16:52.345 --> 16:53.646
but, no, you were too busy
fake cooking.

16:53.713 --> 16:55.782
Okay. Sara, come on.
Enough already,
all right?

16:55.848 --> 16:56.949
Look, we've all been
through a lot.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.585
I just gave
my pillow story.

16:58.651 --> 17:01.154
That doesn't make
an appearance
too often, right?

17:01.221 --> 17:03.290
Honestly,
enough with the cornbread.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.558
It's not a big deal.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.127
It was to mom.

17:09.562 --> 17:10.797
(SIGHS)

17:10.863 --> 17:12.665
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
Go away.

17:13.866 --> 17:14.967
Sara, what's going on?

17:15.034 --> 17:16.069
Nothing.

17:16.136 --> 17:17.537
(SIGHS)

17:17.604 --> 17:18.805
Come on.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.440
Talk to me, all right?

17:20.507 --> 17:23.176
Last year, mom taught me
how to make cornbread,

17:23.243 --> 17:26.279
and...it's the only thing
she ever taught me
how to make.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.649
I... I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

17:30.617 --> 17:31.851
I'll tell you what.

17:31.918 --> 17:34.354
Next year, you can make
the cornbread, I promise.

17:34.421 --> 17:36.289
Or when the power
comes back on,

17:36.356 --> 17:38.491
whichever comes first.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.993
You promise?
It means a lot to me.
Yes.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.495
And, in fact,
when you make it,

17:42.562 --> 17:44.564
you can use
my spud spinner...

17:44.631 --> 17:46.699
drill-bit thing.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.101
Patent pending.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.339
Dad,
what if I told you

17:52.405 --> 17:54.241
I could get my hands
on some food?

17:54.307 --> 17:56.476
Hypothetically.

17:56.543 --> 17:58.211
Wait a second.
You got some food?

17:58.278 --> 17:59.979
I might know
where some is.

18:00.046 --> 18:03.750
Jack, do you have food?

18:05.552 --> 18:08.221
Before I answer,
I want a safety bubble,

18:08.288 --> 18:09.956
protected from any anger.

18:10.022 --> 18:11.258
It's under his bed.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.294
Pre-packaged
military meals.

18:14.361 --> 18:15.695
He also has a stove.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.564
It's in a box in a closet
marked "Sweaters,"

18:17.630 --> 18:19.266
but it's not sweaters,
it's food.

18:19.332 --> 18:21.033
Not cool.
Dad, wait!

18:21.100 --> 18:22.469
No, no, no!
Too late!

18:22.535 --> 18:24.671
About to dig into
a box of sweaters!

18:25.972 --> 18:28.575
Mmm. That cornbread
smells so good.

18:28.641 --> 18:30.610
Thanks.
It was my mom's favorite.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.011
What do you got?

18:32.078 --> 18:33.546
I got
spaghetti and meatballs.
I'm not loving it.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.748
Give me a Salisbury steak,
would you?

18:37.884 --> 18:39.552
There you go.
Cornbread.
KEVIN: Oh.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.488
Oh, yes, that's what
I'm talking about.

18:41.554 --> 18:43.290
Yeah, all right.
You know what,
sweetheart?

18:43.356 --> 18:45.057
I love you,

18:45.124 --> 18:46.659
and we're gonna have this
every year, all right?
Tradition.

18:49.596 --> 18:52.832
(MUFFLED)
Well, I got to say...

18:52.899 --> 18:56.536
you do a good job,
especially cooking
on a camping stove.

18:58.438 --> 19:00.139
You can spit it out,
Dad.
I don't think I can.

19:00.207 --> 19:02.775
It's stuck to the roof
of my mouth.

19:02.842 --> 19:04.177
Oh.

19:06.346 --> 19:08.548
Yeah, it's in there.
It's in there.

19:08.615 --> 19:09.982
But it was good.
It was good.

19:10.049 --> 19:11.284
I wouldn't...
If it was anybody else,

19:11.351 --> 19:12.852
I wouldn't eat it,
but it's good.

19:19.459 --> 19:21.294
I got your voicemail.

19:22.395 --> 19:24.764
You said
you wanted to talk?

19:25.898 --> 19:28.134
Yeah, look, um...

19:28.201 --> 19:29.602
I'm, I'm just glad
we got the chance

19:29.669 --> 19:32.405
to sit down the other night
and work things out.

19:33.306 --> 19:34.807
I hope you're okay.

19:35.675 --> 19:38.177
I am.

19:38.245 --> 19:41.281
I understand you're not
ready for anything yet.

19:41.348 --> 19:42.682
Makes sense.

19:42.749 --> 19:44.284
(SIGHS)

19:45.552 --> 19:49.222
Look,
you're an incredible cook.

19:49.289 --> 19:51.123
And... And...

19:51.190 --> 19:53.092
I love to eat.

19:53.159 --> 19:55.194
(CHUCKLES)

19:55.262 --> 19:56.596
Why do we need
to stop doing that

19:56.663 --> 19:59.131
just because other people
don't understand?

19:59.198 --> 20:01.401
I don't know.

20:01.468 --> 20:03.135
I don't know.
I guess I just...

20:03.202 --> 20:05.372
I need some more time
to think.

20:05.438 --> 20:07.307
I, I get it.

20:07.374 --> 20:08.941
I... I push.

20:11.711 --> 20:15.982
But maybe we could...
start small.

20:16.048 --> 20:19.852
Like, bring over some brownies
or pigs in a blanket.

20:21.288 --> 20:22.555
I'd like that.

20:22.622 --> 20:25.091
Okay. So, then...
that's what we'll do.

20:25.157 --> 20:27.327
We'll take it slow.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.262
One snack at a time.

20:30.963 --> 20:32.665
Okay.

20:32.732 --> 20:35.302
I guess I'll be
seeing you around.
Yeah.

20:35.368 --> 20:37.370
I'll see you around.

20:46.012 --> 20:47.647
You know, I made
some toquitos earlier.

20:47.714 --> 20:49.282
Go get 'em.
Okay.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.886
Don't forget the guac!
I would never!

20:56.489 --> 20:59.726
* Don't want no sweet perfume

20:59.792 --> 21:03.296
* Shake your thing,
go bust your move

21:03.363 --> 21:05.465
* Do, do, do, do, do

21:05.532 --> 21:07.099
* Do, do, do, do

21:07.166 --> 21:10.637
* Oh, yeah

21:10.703 --> 21:13.706
* Don't want
no high-heel shoes

21:13.773 --> 21:16.409
* I just don't want no...
