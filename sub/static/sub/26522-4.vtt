WEBVTT

00:16.266 --> 00:18.143
He was in the basement.

00:19.227 --> 00:21.062
He even ripped my shirt,

00:21.146 --> 00:23.440
and they still didn't believe me.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.734
They never believe me.

00:26.192 --> 00:28.319
They don't even believe me about you.

00:29.612 --> 00:31.573
You believe me, don't you, Abigail?

01:46.397 --> 01:50.151
When I was a kid, my brother
taught me how to spot faces in clouds.

01:50.902 --> 01:53.488
I could pull a face out of
a lot of things. Water...

01:54.030 --> 01:55.156
mud, leaves...

01:57.117 --> 01:58.118
wallpaper.

02:00.745 --> 02:03.414
You know, I get a little older,
I start messing around

02:03.498 --> 02:06.584
with liquor and drugs and...

02:07.043 --> 02:09.420
I was going down all the wrong routes,
you know?

02:10.505 --> 02:12.257
So, uh...

02:12.590 --> 02:14.050
I joined the service,

02:14.134 --> 02:16.052
you know, thinking it
would straight me out.

02:16.636 --> 02:17.846
And it did.

02:20.265 --> 02:22.600
Two thousand and four,
my second tour in Iraq,

02:22.684 --> 02:26.396
my company secured the ruins
of a bombed-out hospital in Baghdad,

02:26.479 --> 02:27.355
and...

02:29.899 --> 02:31.818
We came across this little Iraqi girl.

02:31.901 --> 02:34.279
I mean, she was burnt up, dead.
You know.

02:37.907 --> 02:40.618
See, the thing is, most folks
don't know what happen to...

02:41.536 --> 02:44.414
Most folks don't know what happens
to eyeballs in a fire.

02:45.582 --> 02:47.667
In the right kind of fire, they...

02:48.585 --> 02:49.544
they can melt.

02:52.714 --> 02:55.383
Like runny eggs on black skin.

02:55.717 --> 02:56.551
You know?

02:56.634 --> 02:57.552
And...

02:59.179 --> 03:01.181
I mean, that fucked me up pretty bad.

03:02.307 --> 03:04.684
Um...

03:05.185 --> 03:07.395
anyway, six months later
I'm back in the States,

03:07.478 --> 03:10.607
and pretty soon I start seeing
that little dead girl's face everywhere.

03:10.690 --> 03:14.194
It's in the clouds, it's in the dark,
on fabric.

03:14.277 --> 03:15.945
It's fucking everywhere.

03:16.029 --> 03:16.863
You know?

03:19.908 --> 03:21.868
That little girl's charred body and...

03:22.410 --> 03:23.661
melted eyes...

03:24.787 --> 03:26.164
running down her cheeks.

03:26.456 --> 03:29.918
And pretty soon, before I know it,
I'm using again.

03:33.588 --> 03:36.799
So one night, I drop a little acid
and there she is.

03:38.426 --> 03:41.804
I mean, it's growing
out of the goddamn wallpaper, you know?

03:41.888 --> 03:43.514
I mean, and she's staring at me.

03:44.307 --> 03:45.850
Eyeless even, I can tell.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.228
So I grab this knitting needle...

03:48.645 --> 03:49.812
you know, and...

03:50.021 --> 03:52.190
all I can think about was how to--

03:52.440 --> 03:53.691
how to make it stop.

03:55.443 --> 03:57.278
Seemed like a good idea at the time.

03:59.489 --> 04:01.616
So, then I'm blind.

04:03.826 --> 04:06.454
But I mean, like,
I-can't-see-anything blind, right?

04:07.247 --> 04:08.957
Thing is, is I still see her.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.959
I can't see anything else.

04:11.376 --> 04:12.418
I see her.

04:13.211 --> 04:15.672
Crispy kid with the runny-egg eyes.

04:22.428 --> 04:24.222
Twenty-four/seven, I see her face.

04:25.640 --> 04:26.891
Shit, I see it now.

04:27.725 --> 04:28.726
You know?

04:29.269 --> 04:30.228
But...

04:30.979 --> 04:32.105
I'm here.

04:33.314 --> 04:34.774
Two months I've been clean.

04:34.857 --> 04:36.150
It's a little too late.

04:38.945 --> 04:41.322
I leaned on my habit to get rid
of that face

04:41.406 --> 04:43.491
and my habit made sure
that I never would.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.290
That's why I'm here.

04:53.793 --> 04:54.627
Two months.

04:58.506 --> 04:59.590
Well, thanks, Gordon.

05:00.675 --> 05:01.843
We're glad you're here.

05:04.595 --> 05:06.306
Any of our newbies want to share?

05:12.145 --> 05:13.646
Luke, how about you?

05:16.899 --> 05:19.152
And follow that

05:29.662 --> 05:31.914
Would anyone like to take
a newcomer chip?

05:32.582 --> 05:33.916
How about 30 days clean?

05:36.127 --> 05:37.003
Sixty?

05:38.087 --> 05:38.963
Ninety?

05:48.473 --> 05:49.932
-Thank you.
-You are welcome.

05:57.398 --> 05:58.316
Um...

05:58.399 --> 05:59.942
Luke, um, addict.

06:00.401 --> 06:02.111
-Hi, Luke.
-Hi.

06:03.196 --> 06:07.033
I actually don't know what I
want to say here.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.495
You know, I've never had
this much time before.

06:10.828 --> 06:11.913
You know, 90 days.

06:16.626 --> 06:17.460
Um...

06:21.422 --> 06:22.632
So, here goes.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.219
One.

06:28.596 --> 06:29.597
Two.

06:31.599 --> 06:32.517
Three.

06:33.935 --> 06:34.769
Four.

06:38.106 --> 06:38.981
Five.

06:43.152 --> 06:44.445
Six.

06:47.448 --> 06:48.533
Seven.

06:51.661 --> 06:54.247
That's him,
the man I saw in the basement.

06:54.872 --> 06:57.750
Well, your mother and I
searched the entire basement, pal,

06:58.000 --> 06:59.627
and there's nothing down there.

07:00.294 --> 07:04.173
It's normal for kids to have
imaginary friends and nightmares.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.216
But...

07:06.175 --> 07:07.427
Go ahead, I'm listening.

07:08.302 --> 07:10.304
This house is bad, Dad. It's bad.

07:10.638 --> 07:13.891
Boy oh boy, we could have a heck
of a yard sale, guys.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.643
Yeah.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.730
Has anyone seen Nellie?

07:21.190 --> 07:22.275
That's weird.

07:22.483 --> 07:24.402
-You know, she was just here.
-Oh.

07:24.569 --> 07:27.071
It's okay, I just thought you might like
these cool old buttons

07:27.155 --> 07:28.531
-I found upstairs.
-Buttons?

07:28.614 --> 07:29.949
You got me.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.743
My little Houdini. Look.

07:36.205 --> 07:37.457
Whoa.

07:37.540 --> 07:38.958
Can I have the hat?

07:41.878 --> 07:42.753
Um...

07:43.212 --> 07:44.881
I think it's too big for you, honey.

07:44.964 --> 07:47.133
I don't know. He'll grow into it.

07:48.801 --> 07:51.637
That is a big boy hat, all right.

07:51.721 --> 07:52.847
You want this?

07:53.723 --> 07:55.141
Well, you are a big boy now.

07:55.558 --> 07:56.893
But you know, big boys,

07:56.976 --> 07:59.896
they know the difference between
what's real and what's imaginary.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.481
So what do you say, champ?

08:10.323 --> 08:11.157
You like it?

08:11.741 --> 08:12.658
He loves it.

08:12.867 --> 08:14.035
Well, how do you know that?

08:14.452 --> 08:15.495
It's a twin thing.

08:15.703 --> 08:16.829
You two go and play.

08:21.542 --> 08:23.002
So much up there.

08:28.883 --> 08:29.759
Nice.

08:29.842 --> 08:31.761
I'm having a total déjà vu right now.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.473
What do you see?

08:37.183 --> 08:39.477
Two tables... advancing colors.

08:40.686 --> 08:42.730
Four reading areas.

08:43.773 --> 08:45.733
Casegoods and leather.

08:47.443 --> 08:51.405
A mom and dad sitting in reading chairs
that face each other.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.242
Smaller ones for two...

08:54.659 --> 08:56.702
no, three kids...

08:56.869 --> 08:58.913
who share an open center for play.

09:00.873 --> 09:02.583
Kids' books are on the lower shelf

09:02.667 --> 09:05.711
so even the little boy with the wheelchair
can reach his favorites.

09:06.003 --> 09:07.463
Wow.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.924
That got really specific.

09:12.009 --> 09:12.843
Well...

09:13.886 --> 09:16.430
Casegoods and leather, though, for sure.

09:18.266 --> 09:21.811
And I see an accident waiting to happen
if you don't pull those down.

09:22.812 --> 09:25.022
Bodies swinging back and forth
right there.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.023
Yeah.

09:26.440 --> 09:27.358
I'll get to it.

09:31.654 --> 09:33.364
I must be allergic
to the fourth step.

09:35.283 --> 09:38.452
Every time I do one,
I break out in track marks.

09:39.036 --> 09:41.998
Good. If you liked it
you'd be doing it wrong.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.584
"A fearless moral inventory."

09:44.667 --> 09:46.544
We're only as sick as our secrets.

09:46.627 --> 09:47.878
Okay, well...

09:49.005 --> 09:49.839
Let's see.

09:50.381 --> 09:53.217
I've burned Shirley
for thousands of dollars.

09:53.801 --> 09:55.428
Lied to Theo like it was my job.

09:55.511 --> 09:57.930
Stolen from Steve on countless occasions.

09:58.014 --> 09:59.432
I broke Nellie's heart.

09:59.515 --> 10:00.558
Missed her wedding.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.978
I've even robbed my asshole
of a father.

10:04.061 --> 10:06.272
Though that one doesn't exactly
keep me up at night.

10:06.355 --> 10:08.733
Try stealing morphine from your mother
on her deathbed.

10:09.108 --> 10:11.402
Probably would've
but she didn't really give me a chance.

10:11.485 --> 10:13.112
At least you have other family,
you know?

10:13.613 --> 10:15.990
-Someone you can make amends to.
-Yeah.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.909
But I've done some shitty things, Joey.

10:19.118 --> 10:20.077
Who hasn't?

10:20.161 --> 10:21.996
I've been on the streets since I was 13.

10:22.079 --> 10:24.415
There aren't enough pages
in that notebook for all my shit.

10:24.498 --> 10:27.668
I never know how far back to go.
Like, do I cover high school?

10:28.210 --> 10:31.213
Like stealing cash
out of my aunt's wallet for beer,

10:31.297 --> 10:35.676
or do I just start with "I briefly
lived in a haunted house".

10:40.473 --> 10:41.307
Hey.

10:42.892 --> 10:43.726
You okay?

10:44.685 --> 10:45.519
Yeah.

10:46.395 --> 10:48.356
Something's bothering you tonight.

10:48.439 --> 10:50.983
What could possibly be bothering me
in a place like this?

10:51.400 --> 10:53.653
You're nine months clean, Joey.

10:54.278 --> 10:55.988
Nine months.

10:56.572 --> 10:58.824
Your sobriety, it's full term.

10:58.908 --> 11:01.243
It's a fully-formed little baby anywhere.

11:01.702 --> 11:03.913
Nine months clean is a palace.

11:03.996 --> 11:05.873
-Ten o'clock. Lights out.

11:07.375 --> 11:08.751
Seriously, what's wrong?

11:16.509 --> 11:17.385
How's the step?

11:19.011 --> 11:20.388
You know.

11:20.888 --> 11:22.390
-Kicking my ass.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.016
Fourth one always does.

11:25.601 --> 11:27.603
I meant to tell you,
your brother called earlier.

11:28.979 --> 11:30.022
Steve called?

11:30.106 --> 11:33.109
-Yeah, wanted to know if you were here.
-That's typical.

11:33.442 --> 11:35.820
You should call him back tomorrow.
Tell him about your chip.

11:36.278 --> 11:37.655
Yeah, I don't know.

11:38.155 --> 11:40.950
He won't believe it.

11:41.909 --> 11:43.035
They never do.

11:43.786 --> 11:45.371
-It's kind of their thing.
-I don't know.

11:45.788 --> 11:48.249
That sister of yours,
the one that dropped you off,

11:48.332 --> 11:50.668
she seemed to believe in you.
Tons, actually.

11:50.793 --> 11:51.836
Yeah, well...

11:52.461 --> 11:53.754
It's a twin thing.

11:54.422 --> 11:55.381
Ten o'clock, Joey.

11:55.506 --> 11:58.175
Yeah, yeah.
Back to the ladies' cell block.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.141
-Later.
-Goodnight.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.138
Go.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.400
Luke. You ready?

12:56.942 --> 12:57.818
Ready.

12:58.360 --> 13:01.238
I'm sending down three buttons.
You ready?

13:01.322 --> 13:02.448
I said I'm ready.

13:08.996 --> 13:10.247
Did you get 'em?

13:10.873 --> 13:12.875
I got two.

13:14.043 --> 13:15.169
I sent three.

13:15.294 --> 13:16.670
Well, I only got two.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.339
It must be stuck.

13:19.465 --> 13:22.510
Maybe we can drop some other stuff
to shake it loose.

13:22.718 --> 13:23.552
Like what?

13:25.262 --> 13:27.348
There were some rocks in the garden,
pretty ones.

13:27.598 --> 13:29.308
Abigail showed me one in...

13:33.604 --> 13:34.855
Clara.

13:38.025 --> 13:39.985
Clara.

13:42.279 --> 13:43.948
Was somebody else up there?

13:44.698 --> 13:45.616
Like who?

13:45.866 --> 13:47.576
Mrs. Dudley or Theo?

13:51.997 --> 13:52.915
You're scared.

13:53.499 --> 13:54.458
No, I'm not.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.252
-I can tell.
-How?

13:57.253 --> 13:58.671
Because I'm scared.

14:10.724 --> 14:12.560
Nellie, still down there?

14:12.643 --> 14:13.519
I'm here.

14:13.602 --> 14:14.645
I was right.

14:15.145 --> 14:16.188
There's nothing.

14:16.647 --> 14:18.816
It was probably just Theo...

14:19.275 --> 14:20.359
messing around.

14:32.663 --> 14:34.665
Nellie!

14:38.878 --> 14:39.837
Jesus.

14:40.337 --> 14:43.132
Seven a.m. Breakfast
in ten minutes.

14:55.102 --> 14:57.021
As you've all heard by now...

14:57.187 --> 14:59.356
Joey chose to leave treatment
in the middle of the night.

15:01.191 --> 15:03.652
This is what happens
when we forget why we're here.

15:04.111 --> 15:06.405
I know we're all going to have
a lot of feelings about that.

15:06.488 --> 15:07.865
Some more than others.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.160
This is a moment we should all
pay attention to,

15:11.243 --> 15:12.703
especially you newbies here.

15:13.162 --> 15:16.206
There's a reason
why the program encourages us

15:16.290 --> 15:18.709
to stay out of personal
relationships the first year.

15:18.792 --> 15:20.628
We're not in a relationship.

15:20.711 --> 15:22.212
Any kind of relationship.

15:22.796 --> 15:24.965
We can get real close to people
in recovery.

15:25.049 --> 15:26.050
We're friends.

15:26.133 --> 15:29.011
How the fuck do you expect people
to get through this without friends?

15:29.094 --> 15:29.929
We don't.

15:30.012 --> 15:32.848
One of the biggest issues that can
sometimes happen and just...

15:32.932 --> 15:33.766
sometimes...

15:34.099 --> 15:37.311
and I'm not saying this about
you, Luke, is we can

15:37.394 --> 15:40.814
start to hang our recovery on
someone else instead of on ourselves.

15:41.398 --> 15:44.443
And you lean too hard
on another addict? Shit.

15:45.027 --> 15:47.237
We didn't all end up in here
'cause we're so reliable.

15:50.115 --> 15:52.034
-Luke.
-I'm fine.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.118
Luke.

15:53.869 --> 15:55.788
I'm just getting some air.

15:56.914 --> 15:57.748
Fuck.

16:26.318 --> 16:27.152
Luke.

16:29.279 --> 16:30.948
Luke, you okay in there?

16:46.714 --> 16:48.465
Hi, this is Nell. Please leave a
message after the beep.

16:48.549 --> 16:51.468
Hey, hey, it's, uh, it's me.
Uh...

16:53.512 --> 16:55.556
I... I had a moment. Um...

16:56.181 --> 16:57.683
Last night, one of those.

16:59.435 --> 17:01.520
You know what I'm talking about.

17:02.229 --> 17:05.024
I just wanted to make sure
that you were okay.

17:08.277 --> 17:12.948
I, uh, I don't have a phone...
and you won't reach me at the center.

17:13.032 --> 17:16.452
But, you can call there and leave
me a message there.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.037
I should be back by tonight.

17:18.287 --> 17:19.788
I just have to find a friend.

17:21.248 --> 17:24.001
And don't... don't worry.
I'm fine.

17:24.668 --> 17:25.794
I just...

17:26.587 --> 17:28.380
I just wanted to be sure
you're okay.

17:29.381 --> 17:30.340
You know.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.259
Yeah, okay.

23:03.256 --> 23:05.133
Fuck you.

23:07.552 --> 23:08.929
Learn how to drive.

23:48.802 --> 23:49.636
Hey.

23:50.637 --> 23:51.638
Hey.

23:53.390 --> 23:55.016
How'd you know where to find me?

23:57.394 --> 23:58.645
I know your spots.

24:00.814 --> 24:03.275
Hey, hey, it's okay.

24:03.358 --> 24:04.776
Come on, it's okay.

24:05.193 --> 24:08.530
I found her. We're coming back.
We can be there in 20 minutes.

24:08.613 --> 24:11.783
This isn't a hotel, Luke.
You know that... we're full up

24:11.867 --> 24:14.453
and we need these beds for people
who actually want to get well.

24:14.578 --> 24:16.580
You run, you give up your spot.
That's the way it is.

24:16.663 --> 24:18.331
Please, Paige. Please.

24:18.707 --> 24:20.542
Your best bet is gonna
be a shelter.

24:20.917 --> 24:24.629
That's the last place she should be.
She'll cop, she's already...

24:26.673 --> 24:29.885
Look, I need a place where she can
come down safe.

24:30.260 --> 24:32.429
Ah, fuck, Luke. I...

24:34.890 --> 24:35.765
I'm sorry.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.477
But you did it to yourselves.

24:39.478 --> 24:40.312
Fuck.

24:44.191 --> 24:46.610
She's right.
I knew the rules when I left.

24:49.821 --> 24:50.780
You okay?

24:52.407 --> 24:53.241
Yeah.

24:54.409 --> 24:57.037
Just, I slept on it funny last night.

24:59.080 --> 25:01.082
I told you not to follow me.
Why did you?

25:06.588 --> 25:07.547
I'm sorry.

25:13.386 --> 25:15.680
It's just, you gotta go back.

25:15.805 --> 25:18.099
Just 'cause I messed up,
doesn't mean you have to.

25:18.183 --> 25:19.267
I got an idea.

25:20.185 --> 25:23.563
-If I can get you a motel, then--
-Do you have money?

25:25.690 --> 25:27.442
-No.
-Can you get money?

25:29.736 --> 25:31.571
-What about your sisters or your brother?
-No.

25:31.655 --> 25:33.198
Do you think you can call them?

25:33.281 --> 25:34.699
I'll get some. Okay?

25:35.909 --> 25:39.788
And I'm gonna fix this. I'm gonna get us
a place to stay tonight.

25:40.789 --> 25:41.873
Tomorrow, too.

25:42.332 --> 25:44.042
And I'm gonna get you clean again.

25:45.001 --> 25:47.963
And I'm gonna be right here,
right there with you.

25:49.297 --> 25:51.341
All the way,
just like you were for me, okay?

25:53.385 --> 25:55.220
And we're gonna find a new place.

25:56.680 --> 25:57.639
I promise.

26:04.980 --> 26:06.231
You got anything left?

26:11.611 --> 26:12.529
Yeah.

26:21.079 --> 26:22.914
That should get us most of the way.

26:29.671 --> 26:31.339
Come on.

26:34.509 --> 26:36.136
You got some balls, man.

26:36.344 --> 26:38.179
How long do you wait this morning?

26:38.305 --> 26:39.556
Before hopping the wall?

26:39.889 --> 26:40.849
Oh, not long.

26:41.516 --> 26:43.518
I still can't believe you came after me.

26:45.103 --> 26:47.063
Well, my sister kind of told me to.

26:48.690 --> 26:50.692
No, not really. She...

26:52.694 --> 26:56.197
We're kind of in each other's heads.
It's been like that since we were kids.

26:57.157 --> 26:59.534
It's a twin thing.

27:00.076 --> 27:01.411
You know, once I...

27:01.995 --> 27:03.204
Once I broke my foot...

27:04.539 --> 27:05.457
and...

27:05.749 --> 27:08.376
and Nell called me a few minutes later,
and she was just...

27:09.085 --> 27:12.756
she was just watching TV and her
ankle just went nuts.

27:13.256 --> 27:14.674
-It hurt like hell.

27:14.758 --> 27:16.885
She had no idea why.
She iced it for an hour.

27:16.968 --> 27:18.678
-Bullshit.
-No, it's a true story.

27:22.307 --> 27:23.892
You know, there are...

27:25.810 --> 27:28.271
There are moments
you kind of remind me of her.

27:30.899 --> 27:31.733
And she...

27:33.652 --> 27:36.112
You know, she's always believed in me.

27:36.196 --> 27:37.030
Not...

27:37.530 --> 27:39.658
The rest of the family,
not so much, but...

27:39.783 --> 27:42.827
the only other person that believed in me
like that was you.

27:45.705 --> 27:47.207
So yeah, of course I came.

27:47.874 --> 27:49.834
It's what she would've done for me.

27:54.631 --> 27:55.965
Fuck.

27:56.841 --> 27:57.676
You okay?

27:59.010 --> 28:00.011
Yeah, I'm...

28:00.804 --> 28:02.263
I don't know, I'm cold.

28:03.973 --> 28:06.893
Listen, when we get there,
just hang back.

28:07.477 --> 28:08.978
I don't want her to see your eyes.

28:09.896 --> 28:11.398
-She'll know, okay?
-Yeah.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.568
She always fucking knows.

28:40.260 --> 28:42.220
-Luke.
-Hey, Leigh.

28:42.679 --> 28:43.680
How you doing?

28:45.390 --> 28:48.643
This is a... surprise.

28:49.519 --> 28:50.645
Ah, what are you...

28:52.230 --> 28:53.606
-How are you?
-I'm good.

28:53.898 --> 28:57.944
Ah, I'm really, really good.
Ninety days good, in fact.

28:58.027 --> 28:59.112
That's really great.

29:00.363 --> 29:01.990
I can tell, you look different.

29:02.532 --> 29:03.616
Thank you.

29:04.284 --> 29:07.829
So good, I got a day pass.
Is Steve here?

29:08.163 --> 29:09.330
No, he isn't.

29:09.414 --> 29:11.583
Is he-- Well, is he coming back soon?

29:11.666 --> 29:13.835
I just kinda need to talk to him
about something.

29:13.918 --> 29:15.128
He didn't tell you.

29:15.712 --> 29:16.629
Tell me what?

29:17.005 --> 29:19.257
No, Steve is not coming back soon.
Maybe ever.

29:19.340 --> 29:20.759
He doesn't live here anymore.

29:21.217 --> 29:22.844
Wait, what?

29:24.053 --> 29:25.430
We separated a month ago.

29:27.974 --> 29:29.100
Why?

29:29.893 --> 29:31.895
I would really rather not get into that.

29:36.524 --> 29:37.442
Okay.

29:41.404 --> 29:43.448
Listen, I'm-- I'm clean.

29:44.574 --> 29:47.535
-Ninety days, like I said.
-And I said that's great.

29:50.288 --> 29:52.832
-Leigh, I need to borrow some money.
-Jesus, Luke.

29:52.916 --> 29:54.667
No, it's not like that. I just--

29:54.751 --> 29:57.337
We have been through this
over and over.

29:57.420 --> 30:00.298
It's for a hotel. Or if you could just
let us stay here--

30:00.381 --> 30:02.884
You know you can't do that.
You know that.

30:04.719 --> 30:05.595
Okay.

30:07.514 --> 30:08.973
Okay, can you...

30:10.058 --> 30:12.560
Can you just give me
Steve's address then, please?

30:13.436 --> 30:14.813
I think he's out of town.

30:17.065 --> 30:18.650
I mean, even if he wasn't.

30:20.276 --> 30:22.570
I am proud of you, I am.

30:23.279 --> 30:24.948
But you have to talk to Steven.

30:25.865 --> 30:27.534
You know what he's going to say.

30:27.784 --> 30:30.495
I really can't deal with
this right now.

30:30.620 --> 30:32.580
Things are bad enough.

30:33.289 --> 30:34.999
-You're not serious.
-I am.

30:36.376 --> 30:37.919
They'll hang a toy phone around
your neck

30:38.002 --> 30:40.213
and you have to wear it all day,
maybe longer.

30:40.296 --> 30:42.048
Like a child's toy phone?

30:42.131 --> 30:45.301
Yes, it's like The Scarlet Letter
for violating the phone rule.

30:45.385 --> 30:49.055
Improper use of a phone.
They catch you, you wear the phone, like

30:49.138 --> 30:51.933
"Let this be a chilling example
to the others."

30:53.309 --> 30:54.227
You...

30:54.686 --> 30:58.690
You can't make calls in the first 30 days
unless a caseworker signs off, so...

30:58.773 --> 31:02.610
-Well, that's a little harsh, isn't it?
-It's not as harsh as an overdose.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.113
I mean, addicts, we're...

31:05.655 --> 31:07.949
we're pretty slippery in early recovery.

31:08.032 --> 31:10.368
That's why they confiscate
our cell phones, you know,

31:10.869 --> 31:12.871
in case someone was to call
a connection.

31:12.954 --> 31:13.913
Yeah.

31:14.038 --> 31:15.707
What if you want to call your mom?

31:15.790 --> 31:18.501
For some folks in there,
their connection is their mom.

31:18.585 --> 31:19.752
-Truly.
-It's true.

31:25.174 --> 31:26.467
So...

31:27.010 --> 31:28.511
Luke tells me you're a writer.

31:30.054 --> 31:32.348
He did?
I'm surprised he mentioned it.

31:33.057 --> 31:34.851
Where do you get your ideas from?

31:38.104 --> 31:40.607
I write about haunted houses, mostly.

31:41.024 --> 31:43.943
And haunted people.
I'm afraid there's no shortage of them.

31:44.277 --> 31:45.486
Must run in the family.

31:45.570 --> 31:47.447
I mean, Luke's a great writer, too.

31:47.530 --> 31:48.615
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

31:48.740 --> 31:49.657
No, I'm not.

31:49.741 --> 31:52.535
Stop selling yourself short.
He's really talented.

31:52.619 --> 31:54.871
You should show them the one about...

31:54.954 --> 31:58.166
the short story with
the imaginary little friend in the garden.

31:58.249 --> 32:00.251
-The one-- Do you know that one?
-Yeah.

32:00.543 --> 32:02.253
-Abigail.
-Yeah.

32:02.378 --> 32:04.213
I put her in one of my books, too.

32:04.672 --> 32:07.550
Something tells me
Luke won't get as much blow back for his.

32:09.218 --> 32:11.012
It's just an essay.

32:11.095 --> 32:12.639
It's not anything, you know.

32:12.722 --> 32:14.265
I keep telling him
he should publish it.

32:15.016 --> 32:16.059
Off his name alone.

32:16.476 --> 32:18.561
Maybe get a sweet place
like this for himself.

32:18.853 --> 32:20.688
I mean, you guys--
This is so awesome.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.815
You guys got it all, man.

32:22.982 --> 32:24.567
Where do you go from here?

32:25.568 --> 32:27.487
Nothing left to do except...

32:27.612 --> 32:29.906
maybe fill this place up with some kids,
I guess.

32:34.410 --> 32:36.454
So is this your first rehab, Joey?

32:36.621 --> 32:38.414
Ah, it's far from it.

32:39.374 --> 32:41.793
But some of us are addicted
to treatment centers, huh?

32:42.794 --> 32:44.462
Not Luke's first rodeo either.

32:45.588 --> 32:48.091
So what's different this time?
Something must be.

32:48.174 --> 32:50.385
I mean, you know the definition
of insanity.

32:50.468 --> 32:51.302
Steve.

32:51.386 --> 32:53.304
"Doing the same thing over and over--"

32:53.388 --> 32:56.140
"...and expecting different results."
Sure, man.

32:56.599 --> 32:58.685
They're all different, though.
Every day is different.

32:58.768 --> 33:02.730
Every craving is different.
Every meeting is different.

33:03.189 --> 33:05.692
Right. I'm not trying to suggest
you're not taking this seriously.

33:05.817 --> 33:06.651
Oh...

33:06.859 --> 33:07.819
And I'm just...

33:08.069 --> 33:09.112
This time around...

33:10.029 --> 33:11.614
I'm just speaking for myself, like...

33:12.323 --> 33:13.491
Like, I got more support.

33:14.701 --> 33:16.160
And I'm giving more support.

33:16.953 --> 33:17.829
So...

33:18.788 --> 33:20.581
in a sense, I guess you could say...

33:21.082 --> 33:23.209
it looks like the same thing
over and over again,

33:23.292 --> 33:24.711
but that's not insanity.

33:25.128 --> 33:27.255
Out there on the streets,
that's insanity.

33:27.964 --> 33:28.881
Of course.

33:29.882 --> 33:31.968
So that's what recovery is, you know?

33:32.051 --> 33:34.679
It's the same thing
over and over again,

33:34.762 --> 33:36.597
in spite of the result, or...

33:36.889 --> 33:37.890
in spite of

33:38.433 --> 33:41.436
a backslide or in spite of a full-fledged
fucking relapse.

33:43.896 --> 33:46.441
Doesn't mean you stop just 'cause
it gets a little repetitive.

33:47.525 --> 33:48.651
One day at a time.

33:50.486 --> 33:51.821
When we decide to get clean,

33:51.904 --> 33:54.699
it's not because we expect it
to be fucking exciting, you know?

34:02.999 --> 34:05.460
Is it normal to bring a friend home
on a day pass?

34:05.585 --> 34:06.419
Yeah.

34:06.919 --> 34:08.004
It happens.

34:08.379 --> 34:11.549
-I just never really felt like it before.
-You must like her.

34:12.467 --> 34:13.676
I admire her.

34:14.594 --> 34:15.428
Don't you?

34:16.596 --> 34:18.598
I feel like she's got her shit together.

34:18.806 --> 34:21.392
I'd think you'd want me to take a page
out of a book like that.

34:21.476 --> 34:24.353
Look, I get it. She's charming.

34:25.396 --> 34:27.148
She's articulate, she's funny.

34:27.648 --> 34:30.068
-Yeah.
-Disarming, you might say.

34:30.610 --> 34:32.153
You might even say "slick."

34:34.072 --> 34:34.906
Slick?

34:35.698 --> 34:36.866
Just saying.

34:37.492 --> 34:39.035
You know she stayed up with me.

34:39.702 --> 34:41.746
That first week when I was coming down.

34:42.205 --> 34:43.956
You ever seen someone
in withdrawal, Steve?

34:44.040 --> 34:44.957
Nope.

34:45.666 --> 34:46.667
Well, it's hell.

34:47.376 --> 34:48.211
It's...

34:48.878 --> 34:50.546
You're freezing all the time.

34:50.630 --> 34:53.508
LA in July, no air conditioning,
freezing.

34:53.758 --> 34:56.552
Muscle aches, stiff as boards,
nausea, shakes.

34:56.677 --> 34:58.471
-I wouldn't know.
-Well, she does.

34:58.554 --> 34:59.764
Because she was there.

35:00.431 --> 35:02.558
And she talked me through it,
she rode it out with me.

35:03.559 --> 35:05.436
Wow. Awesome.

35:07.313 --> 35:08.815
Fuck. Steve.

35:09.899 --> 35:12.985
I'm not-- I'm not asking
for her hand in marriage.

35:13.069 --> 35:16.072
I just wanted to bring a friend to dinner
and you're not giving her a chance.

35:16.155 --> 35:17.156
No, I guess I'm not.

35:17.240 --> 35:19.033
-Why not?
-I'm fresh out of those.

35:20.493 --> 35:21.702
I gave 'em all to you.

35:23.412 --> 35:24.330
Wow.

35:24.914 --> 35:28.042
-I just want you to be careful, is all.
-I'm doing good, Steve.

35:28.126 --> 35:31.295
Anyway, she's a good person,
she's a good influence.

35:32.338 --> 35:35.925
Just because someone's a good person,
just because you care about them...

35:36.551 --> 35:38.219
doesn't mean they won't burn you.

35:39.679 --> 35:41.222
You're a good person, Luke.

35:41.305 --> 35:42.223
And I love you.

35:43.432 --> 35:44.350
And...

35:44.809 --> 35:45.643
you know.

35:48.521 --> 35:49.480
Thanks, Steve.

35:51.899 --> 35:54.944
You know, I'm so glad we got to share
this milestone.

35:55.778 --> 35:59.073
That's all I wanted. Thirty days clean
so you can make me feel like shit again.

36:01.742 --> 36:03.327
-Luke.
-Fuck you.

36:16.215 --> 36:18.759
Jesus, Steve.
It's fucking freezing in here.

36:42.867 --> 36:44.577
Fother mucker.

36:53.711 --> 36:54.545
Hey, Luke.

36:57.798 --> 36:58.925
Hey... Hey, Steve.

37:03.804 --> 37:05.723
This isn't what it looks like.

37:07.099 --> 37:08.100
Are you cold?

37:08.351 --> 37:09.185
Yeah.

37:10.978 --> 37:12.396
How'd you know where to find me?

37:15.900 --> 37:18.861
Tell you what, I've got 200 bucks here.

37:19.278 --> 37:20.446
You hand me that iPad,

37:20.529 --> 37:22.990
you can keep the cash
and sell that old camera.

37:23.658 --> 37:25.243
But, I need the iPad.

37:25.993 --> 37:26.953
It stays here.

37:36.337 --> 37:37.171
Hey.

37:38.130 --> 37:39.006
Hey.

37:39.423 --> 37:41.676
Oh my God, I saw him walking in.
I thought you were fucked.

37:41.759 --> 37:42.677
It's all good.

37:46.097 --> 37:47.890
Should be enough for a night,
maybe two.

37:48.683 --> 37:50.351
And some food. Oh, here.

37:54.021 --> 37:55.314
Amazing, Luke.

37:55.606 --> 37:57.024
Amazing.

37:58.442 --> 38:01.529
Goddammit, it's cold tonight.
Are you cold?

38:02.947 --> 38:04.198
Where are we

38:04.282 --> 38:05.491
Yeah, almost.

38:05.574 --> 38:06.951
It's a few more blocks.

38:07.034 --> 38:09.662
I want a clean hotel,
no junkies on the sidewalk.

38:09.745 --> 38:12.498
Man, I don't know if I'm gonna make it
a couple blocks without a piss.

38:13.791 --> 38:15.126
I'll just...

38:15.209 --> 38:17.878
pop into the little junkies' room
and be back in a minute.

38:23.301 --> 38:24.135
Baby.

38:25.720 --> 38:26.762
You got a fever?

38:27.221 --> 38:28.514
Yeah, maybe.

38:30.599 --> 38:32.893
It's my arms and legs, you know?
Muscle aches.

38:32.977 --> 38:34.145
No, I'm fine.

38:34.854 --> 38:36.063
Hey, I...

38:37.315 --> 38:38.274
Thank you.

38:41.027 --> 38:42.028
For coming after me.

38:43.029 --> 38:43.904
Oh.

38:45.239 --> 38:46.073
It means a lot.

38:47.408 --> 38:48.326
You're welcome.

38:58.210 --> 38:59.211
It's all right.

39:08.179 --> 39:09.263
What are you doing?

39:10.723 --> 39:11.807
Be back in a flash.

39:15.936 --> 39:16.771
Okay.

39:39.418 --> 39:41.379
Come on, let's-- let's keep going.

39:49.053 --> 39:49.887
Joey.

39:58.270 --> 39:59.105
Joey.

40:08.531 --> 40:09.448
Fuck.

40:10.366 --> 40:11.242
Joey!

40:16.664 --> 40:17.498
Joey!

40:26.298 --> 40:27.258
Joey!

41:14.388 --> 41:15.556
Luke, addict.

41:16.223 --> 41:17.766
-Hi, Luke.
-Hi.

41:18.976 --> 41:22.521
I actually don't know
what I want to say here.

41:22.897 --> 41:24.106
You know, I've...

41:24.398 --> 41:26.275
I've never had this much time before.

41:26.567 --> 41:27.693
You know, 90 days.

41:32.490 --> 41:33.324
Um...

41:37.286 --> 41:38.496
So here goes.

41:39.622 --> 41:43.501
It's taken me ten years
to get 90 days clean.

41:44.585 --> 41:49.256
And I'm starting step four,
which is always the one that does me in.

41:50.883 --> 41:53.469
"A fearless moral inventory."

41:56.305 --> 42:00.017
Now, I've been called a lot of things
in my life,

42:00.100 --> 42:03.312
but "fearless" is not one of them.

42:04.897 --> 42:07.942
You know, I was always
a scared little kid,

42:08.692 --> 42:09.652
and I thought...

42:10.486 --> 42:14.114
I thought I'd get braver
as I got older, but...

42:15.032 --> 42:16.242
um, I didn't.

42:17.660 --> 42:18.702
I, um...

42:20.579 --> 42:22.081
I just got scared of anything.

42:24.875 --> 42:28.963
My mom committed suicide
when I was six years old.

42:30.005 --> 42:33.300
And my siblings and I
were sent to live with our aunt,

42:33.384 --> 42:37.179
and, I mean, I was just a kid, you know.
I didn't...

42:38.514 --> 42:40.724
I didn't really understand death yet.

42:40.808 --> 42:45.187
So, I guess I just expected her to...

42:46.897 --> 42:47.731
to come back.

42:51.902 --> 42:53.445
And every night, I'd...

42:55.197 --> 42:58.367
I'd stare out my window as the cars
came around the corner,

42:58.450 --> 43:02.538
just hoping that one would stop
and my mom would step out,

43:02.621 --> 43:04.290
you know, to come take me home.

43:05.040 --> 43:07.459
Every time I saw those headlights
come round the corner,

43:07.543 --> 43:09.712
I'd sit up in bed...

43:09.795 --> 43:13.424
and I'm staring out of my window,
just full of hope.

43:14.216 --> 43:17.636
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

43:19.513 --> 43:21.599
But they'd just keep driving.

43:26.895 --> 43:28.897
Those tail lights, they were the worst.

43:29.982 --> 43:32.526
Red eyes in the dark,
just taking hope with them.

43:35.988 --> 43:37.197
I mean, Mom...

43:37.573 --> 43:39.158
she never came back, of course,

43:39.241 --> 43:41.285
but other things
from when I was a kid,

43:41.785 --> 43:42.953
they came back.

43:43.203 --> 43:44.622
And I guess that's...

43:45.956 --> 43:49.126
I guess that's why I started using
in the first place, you know?

43:50.294 --> 43:51.629
To keep those things away.

43:56.508 --> 43:58.677
And I'd get clean...

43:58.761 --> 44:00.262
you know, a week, a month.

44:01.305 --> 44:04.975
But I'd always feel 'em, you know,
just sneaking back up on me.

44:05.684 --> 44:08.187
-So I'd use.
-He's not real.

44:08.687 --> 44:10.981
You know, my family,
they're not gonna believe this.

44:11.065 --> 44:12.524
They never really believe me.

44:12.900 --> 44:14.443
And I don't blame them.

44:14.526 --> 44:18.238
You know, I fucked them over
so many times. Lied, stole.

44:19.490 --> 44:22.076
Come on, you all know what I mean.

44:24.495 --> 44:25.621
And I guess...

44:29.500 --> 44:30.584
I guess I'll...

44:32.294 --> 44:36.340
I'll never know how it felt for them
to be done like that.

44:39.760 --> 44:40.761
I hope I never know.

44:44.348 --> 44:46.266
Ah, sorry.

44:46.350 --> 44:49.019
I want to thank my caseworker, Paige.

44:50.396 --> 44:52.356
And every one at our recovery house.

44:53.023 --> 44:54.858
And someone...

44:55.651 --> 44:59.029
Someone special,
who's always had my back.

44:59.905 --> 45:00.864
Thank you.

45:02.074 --> 45:03.242
Any addict alone...

45:04.410 --> 45:05.953
...is in bad company.

45:06.328 --> 45:07.913
That's right.

45:08.664 --> 45:09.498
Thank you.

45:18.757 --> 45:20.175
I couldn't help her.

45:21.885 --> 45:23.595
We've been waiting
for you to call.

45:23.971 --> 45:25.764
There's something I need to tell you.

45:25.848 --> 45:28.392
Listen, I know I fucked up. Okay?

45:29.268 --> 45:31.812
But I... I didn't use, I didn't.

45:31.937 --> 45:34.148
And I'm so fucking cold,

45:34.231 --> 45:37.067
and my... and my arms and legs
are so stiff.

45:37.151 --> 45:38.152
I just, I...

45:39.611 --> 45:42.197
I... I need a bed. Like, a couch.

45:42.281 --> 45:45.451
I'll sleep on the goddamn floor.
Just... please.

45:45.534 --> 45:48.370
Please, please let me come back.
Please.

45:49.329 --> 45:51.331
Where are you?
We'll come get you.

45:53.208 --> 45:56.545
One, two, three, four,

45:56.628 --> 45:59.089
five, six, seven.

46:01.925 --> 46:06.889
One, two, three, four, five, six,

46:06.972 --> 46:07.848
seven.

46:23.781 --> 46:24.656
Hey.

46:26.450 --> 46:27.493
You're awake.

46:27.868 --> 46:29.453
Well, yeah, 'cause...

46:29.703 --> 46:30.704
you're awake.

46:31.288 --> 46:32.748
I saw her again.

46:34.291 --> 46:35.542
The Bent-Neck Lady?

46:47.513 --> 46:49.431
Mommy and Daddy don't believe me.

46:50.682 --> 46:51.558
Ever.

46:53.894 --> 46:56.605
They say she's a nightmare,
but she's real.

46:56.688 --> 46:58.190
I know she is.

47:00.734 --> 47:01.985
I got an idea.

47:13.372 --> 47:16.834
You need seven,
and you set them up like this.

47:17.876 --> 47:18.919
Why seven?

47:19.753 --> 47:21.630
Mom, Dad...

47:22.214 --> 47:24.842
Steven, Shirl, Theo,

47:25.050 --> 47:26.426
you, me.

47:27.386 --> 47:28.846
It has to be seven.

47:29.805 --> 47:33.559
It helps if you touch each one
and count out loud.

47:35.185 --> 47:37.354
One, two,

47:37.938 --> 47:39.857
three, four,

47:40.566 --> 47:43.110
five, six, seven.

47:44.069 --> 47:45.153
That keeps you safe.

47:45.571 --> 47:47.781
Sometimes you got to do it a lot.

47:47.865 --> 47:49.533
Like, a lot a lot.

47:50.701 --> 47:52.077
Don't forget to count.

47:53.996 --> 47:54.872
One...

47:56.081 --> 47:56.957
two...

47:57.708 --> 47:58.542
three...

47:58.625 --> 48:01.503
Four, five, six, seven.

48:06.216 --> 48:09.094
One, two, three, four,

48:09.177 --> 48:11.096
five, six, seven.

48:15.767 --> 48:20.147
One, two, three, four, five, six...

48:22.274 --> 48:23.150
seven.

48:30.782 --> 48:35.913
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven.

48:36.246 --> 48:41.168
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven.

48:41.460 --> 48:44.046
One, two, three...

49:03.357 --> 49:04.775
Come home, my love.

49:29.007 --> 49:30.092
Steve.

49:34.262 --> 49:36.348
I'm so sorry, I didn't--

49:36.890 --> 49:39.434
I couldn't-- I couldn't help her.

49:47.484 --> 49:51.029
And I'm so-- I'm so cold.
I didn't...

49:52.614 --> 49:56.201
My arms and legs
are... are stiff.

49:56.284 --> 49:57.494
And I...

49:57.661 --> 49:58.745
I...

49:58.829 --> 50:00.622
It's...

50:01.039 --> 50:03.166
It's like-- It's like withdrawal, but...

50:03.667 --> 50:05.669
but I didn't use.

50:06.420 --> 50:08.422
I wasn't using, but...

50:09.297 --> 50:10.257
But I...

50:10.590 --> 50:12.217
But I feel it anyway.

50:15.554 --> 50:17.472
You... You believe me, right?

50:19.224 --> 50:20.684
You gotta come with me.

50:22.477 --> 50:24.104
You gotta come with me, Luke.

50:24.187 --> 50:25.313
What

50:25.689 --> 50:26.648
It's Nell.

50:30.485 --> 50:31.737
Nell's dead.

50:44.124 --> 50:44.958
How?

50:46.460 --> 50:48.336
It was... It was suicide.

51:02.017 --> 51:02.851
No.

51:04.186 --> 51:05.103
Stevie...

51:10.859 --> 51:11.818
it wasn't.
