00:17.222 --> 00:19.089
Mike! Mike! Mike!

00:19.191 --> 00:22.426
I'm hearing that some banks may
be requiring a federal bailout.

00:22.528 --> 00:24.428
Bailouts are not on the table.

00:24.530 --> 00:28.332
It is possible some banks may
require massive capital infusions.

00:28.434 --> 00:30.901
That's the literal definition
of bailing something out.

00:31.003 --> 00:33.203
There will be no bailouts.
I was clear on this point.

00:33.305 --> 00:34.705
Very clear on this.

00:36.475 --> 00:38.475
So, next up on the hit parade,

00:38.577 --> 00:40.877
we get to decide which
banks to bail out.

00:40.980 --> 00:42.446
Well, I hope to fiscal fuck

00:42.548 --> 00:45.415
the fed has a trillion dollars
stuffed in a mattress somewhere.

00:45.517 --> 00:47.484
There are three banks in
danger that are gonna need

00:47.586 --> 00:49.453
massive infusions of
cash over the weekend.

00:49.555 --> 00:52.356
Essentially, we can only
afford to bail out two.

00:52.458 --> 00:53.724
And if we do nothing?

00:53.826 --> 00:56.126
Go to the ATM Monday and
dust will come out.

00:56.228 --> 00:58.829
<i>This is not a decision we
can make based on politics.</i>

00:58.931 --> 01:01.631
- No, definitely not.
- But we've got to save Janders Capital

01:01.734 --> 01:03.934
- because they're based in Illinois.
- We need Illinois.

01:04.036 --> 01:07.437
That's one. Paulsten-Berheim
or EM Wheelright?

01:07.539 --> 01:10.574
Well, Wheelright is
Charlie Baird's bank.

01:12.144 --> 01:13.577
<i>So...</i>

01:13.679 --> 01:16.246
My pick is EM Wheelright.

01:16.348 --> 01:17.714
You know what, Tom? I think...

01:17.816 --> 01:19.983
oh, yes. What he just said.

01:20.085 --> 01:24.054
Um, could everyone who doesn't absolutely
have to be here please leave the room?

01:24.156 --> 01:27.157
Thank you.

01:27.259 --> 01:29.485
Ma'am, you cannot bail
out Charlie Baird's bank.

01:29.510 --> 01:30.251
Why not?

01:30.329 --> 01:32.496
'Cause that's gonna look like you
care more about your boyfriend

01:32.598 --> 01:34.831
than you do the economy, normal people,

01:34.933 --> 01:37.000
and everything else you're
supposed to care about.

01:37.102 --> 01:40.270
- AIDS for example.
- Thanks, Kent's autism.

01:40.372 --> 01:43.807
Look, there is no love lost
between me and Charlie Baird.

01:43.909 --> 01:47.044
Though it pains me to say
it, his bank is stronger.

01:47.146 --> 01:49.246
- That's my point.
- It's the right call for the future.

01:49.348 --> 01:53.383
Ma'am, you are not going to have a
future if you bail out Charlie.

01:53.485 --> 01:56.119
All right, I'm gonna
need some more time.

01:56.221 --> 01:58.855
At least when Truman made the
decision to drop the bomb,

01:58.957 --> 02:01.058
he wasn't fucking anyone in Hiroshima.

02:01.160 --> 02:02.125
That we know of.

02:02.227 --> 02:05.295
Hello there. I'm Jonah Ryan.

02:07.533 --> 02:09.433
And I grew up right here

02:09.535 --> 02:11.868
<i>in the awesome state of New Hampshire.</i>

02:11.970 --> 02:14.004
The Granite State of the United States.

02:14.106 --> 02:15.906
<i>For your
family, for your future,</i>

02:16.008 --> 02:17.707
<i>vote Ryan for Congress.</i>

02:17.810 --> 02:20.577
My name is Jonah Ryan and
I approve this message.

02:22.347 --> 02:25.082
So, now you have all seen the ad

02:25.184 --> 02:28.151
and we want to know what
you think about it.

02:28.253 --> 02:30.720
- <i>Anyone?</i>
- I didn't like the guy.

02:30.823 --> 02:32.789
You don't like him? Okay.

02:32.891 --> 02:35.358
That wood he's chopping,
it's not gonna burn right.

02:35.461 --> 02:38.228
To burn... the wood
is not going to burn.

02:38.330 --> 02:39.896
What else?

02:39.998 --> 02:41.631
His head is too big for his body.

02:41.733 --> 02:44.601
But then sometimes his body
is too big for his head.

02:44.703 --> 02:47.838
- He's the wrong shape.
- <i>Uh, shape is wrong?</i>

02:47.940 --> 02:51.608
Does anyone have anything
positive to say about the ad?

02:54.046 --> 02:56.146
- I like the kid.
- Yeah.

02:56.248 --> 02:58.215
Like the kid in the ad, the little boy.

02:58.317 --> 03:00.183
But I did not like that
he was next to that guy.

03:00.285 --> 03:02.586
I was like, "Run, kid."

03:02.688 --> 03:04.955
Oh, surprise, surprise. Look who's here.

03:05.057 --> 03:09.392
Do you morons really not understand
that this is a two-way mirror?

03:09.495 --> 03:12.529
Seriously? Are you shocked
by that technology?

03:12.631 --> 03:14.364
<i>I work in the fucking West Wing,</i>

03:14.466 --> 03:16.233
you Pepperidge Farm ad motherfuckers.

03:16.335 --> 03:17.634
- Fuck you.
- Watch your mouth.

03:17.736 --> 03:20.237
Sit your fucking mom
jeans ass down, dude.

03:20.339 --> 03:22.639
<i>You've got to learn to
control your fucking temper!</i>

03:22.741 --> 03:25.475
Wow. Lord.

03:25.577 --> 03:27.511
This is beyond language.

03:27.613 --> 03:29.246
<i>I know the world of focus groups.</i>

03:29.348 --> 03:31.548
I think maybe we picked
the wrong candidate.

03:31.650 --> 03:35.519
Uh-huh. How is Catherine
there and also here?

03:35.621 --> 03:38.121
- She's not here, ma'am.
- Since when?

03:38.223 --> 03:41.458
- Last week.
- Oh, my God.

03:41.560 --> 03:44.794
And then to put a fucking
cherry on this shit sundae,

03:44.897 --> 03:46.530
did you guys see that
article in "Politico"?

03:46.632 --> 03:48.407
"Meyer's Five Biggest
Economic Mistakes"?

03:48.432 --> 03:49.023
<i>No.</i>

03:49.101 --> 03:51.067
"Recession Has a New
NAME: the Selina Slump"?

03:51.170 --> 03:53.870
No. Gary, you have the machine?

03:53.972 --> 03:55.572
- Yeah.
- <i>Listen to this.</i>

03:55.674 --> 03:57.474
"In a further sign of low morale"...

03:57.576 --> 03:59.476
No, you've got to read it properly.

03:59.578 --> 04:01.811
- Nope, that's not it.
- You've got to spin it.

04:01.914 --> 04:05.115
Here we go. Why does it
keep doing the turning?

04:05.217 --> 04:08.418
"A high-level West Wing staffer
was recently overheard

04:08.520 --> 04:11.321
calling the president the C word."

04:11.423 --> 04:14.191
Can you believe this shit?

04:14.293 --> 04:16.826
- Oh, wow.
- That's crazy.

04:16.928 --> 04:18.428
Yeah, this is broken, by the way.

04:18.529 --> 04:20.497
Ma'am, I think that we
need to resume our focus

04:20.599 --> 04:21.964
on relaunching Jonah's campaign.

04:22.067 --> 04:23.567
We need a Jonah whisperer,

04:23.669 --> 04:25.135
except somebody who's gonna, like,

04:25.237 --> 04:26.836
yell in his face and call him stupid.

04:26.939 --> 04:29.673
- Oh, we need Dan Egan.
- Dan turned us down.

04:29.775 --> 04:31.508
But I've got some interviews lined up.

04:31.610 --> 04:34.344
- We'll make the right choice.
- Well, are you doing it?

04:34.446 --> 04:36.713
You're just sitting here
farting into my couch.

04:36.815 --> 04:38.582
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

04:38.684 --> 04:40.483
<i>Amy, I need to
talk to you for a moment.</i>

04:40.586 --> 04:41.436
Yes, ma'am.

04:41.461 --> 04:44.011
I want you to find out
who called me a cunt.

04:44.089 --> 04:47.857
- Ma'am...
- Listen, with the votes and the banks,

04:47.960 --> 04:50.511
we can't have a traitor
in our castle, right?

04:50.536 --> 04:51.385
Yeah...

04:51.463 --> 04:53.663
- You need to bring me a head.
- Yes, ma'am.

04:53.765 --> 04:56.166
Hey, Dan. You want to go to lunch later

04:56.268 --> 04:57.834
at Hansong Korean Barbecue?

04:57.936 --> 04:59.502
Come on, I've got a
Groupon, expires Monday.

04:59.605 --> 05:01.371
50 bucks for $100 worth of food.

05:01.473 --> 05:04.274
It's in Annandale, Mike. No one
from DC goes to fucking Annandale.

05:04.376 --> 05:07.277
Hey, how about an $80 in-home
massage for 40 bucks?

05:07.379 --> 05:09.145
- With release?
- No.

05:09.248 --> 05:09.970
Then what's the point?

05:09.996 --> 05:11.538
Hey, why did you turn
down the Jonah job?

05:11.617 --> 05:12.324
Come on.

05:12.349 --> 05:14.208
Jesus, Dan, you wouldn't
know the smart move

05:14.286 --> 05:16.286
if it bent you over and fucked
you with a Coke bottle.

05:16.388 --> 05:18.521
If Jonah loses, no
one's gonna blame you.

05:18.624 --> 05:21.391
- If he wins, you're a political genius.
- I'll think about it.

05:21.493 --> 05:24.661
Think fast. Ben's interviewing
candidates right now.

05:24.763 --> 05:26.396
Not worried.

05:29.735 --> 05:31.001
Move, move!

05:31.103 --> 05:33.169
The widow bravely carrying
the flag narrative

05:33.272 --> 05:34.971
has traction for about a week.

05:35.073 --> 05:36.606
After that, done.

05:36.708 --> 05:38.208
Hey, Ben, can I...

05:38.310 --> 05:39.542
Dan, do you know Candi Caruso?

05:39.645 --> 05:41.211
- <i>Yes.</i>
- No.

05:41.313 --> 05:43.680
Can I speak to you for a second?

05:43.782 --> 05:46.516
- Yeah. Excuse me.
- Sorry.

05:50.155 --> 05:52.589
I'm sorry, Candi. The
position's been filled.

05:52.691 --> 05:54.624
- Aw.
- Thanks for coming in.

05:54.726 --> 05:56.559
- It's good seeing you again.
- Mm-hmm.

05:56.662 --> 05:58.628
What's this about? Am I in trouble?

05:58.730 --> 06:01.097
No, no. The president

06:01.199 --> 06:02.832
asked me to speak to everyone
about a certain matter.

06:02.934 --> 06:04.868
Is this about the coffee pods
I took from the kitchen?

06:04.970 --> 06:07.637
- We had a brunch and I took them.
- No. No.

06:07.739 --> 06:10.540
Mike, do you know who called
the president a cunt?

06:12.077 --> 06:14.477
No, I... I have no idea.

06:16.315 --> 06:18.715
Okay, I'm sorry. I can't do this.

06:18.817 --> 06:21.017
She put me in charge of this
whole stupid investigation

06:21.119 --> 06:22.552
and it was me. I called her a cunt.

06:22.654 --> 06:23.787
You did?

06:23.889 --> 06:25.155
I thought everyone knew it was me.

06:25.257 --> 06:26.389
I was in the Senate building with Dan

06:26.491 --> 06:27.791
and I'm sure someone overheard me.

06:27.893 --> 06:30.794
I shouted it into my phone
on the Acela Quiet Car.

06:33.632 --> 06:35.832
Okay.

06:35.934 --> 06:37.167
I've made my decision.

06:37.269 --> 06:39.969
We are going to bail out Charlie's bank.

06:40.072 --> 06:41.471
<i>I don't care what hits we take.</i>

06:41.573 --> 06:43.006
It's for the good of the
country in the long run.

06:43.108 --> 06:44.841
- Bravo, Madam President.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

06:44.943 --> 06:46.242
- Ma'am, if I could just...
- <i>Nope.</i>

06:46.345 --> 06:47.911
I don't want to hear it, okay?

06:48.013 --> 06:49.746
That's my final solution.

06:49.848 --> 06:51.848
"Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"

06:51.950 --> 06:53.817
Do you get it? Yeah.

06:55.087 --> 06:56.953
<i>I can't ever forget</i>

06:57.055 --> 07:00.156
it's about the people.

07:01.927 --> 07:03.693
Are you even getting any of this?

07:03.795 --> 07:05.161
Getting what?

07:05.263 --> 07:07.797
I was looking thoughtfully
out the window.

07:07.899 --> 07:10.667
Some straight up JFK level shit.

07:10.769 --> 07:13.670
I was just getting some
B-roll of the fax machine.

07:15.507 --> 07:18.108
Ah! Come on!

07:18.210 --> 07:19.576
God.

07:19.678 --> 07:21.578
You know, the state
that you live in sucks.

07:23.048 --> 07:24.981
Sir, as your director of communications,

07:25.083 --> 07:27.517
I need to tell you that we just
got a letter from the band Rush.

07:27.619 --> 07:28.303
Really?

07:28.328 --> 07:30.377
They said that we can't use
the song "Working Man" anymore

07:30.455 --> 07:32.555
because they find you odious.

07:32.657 --> 07:34.324
You know what? I play what I want.

07:34.426 --> 07:37.026
Copyright shit went out with the Zune.

07:37.129 --> 07:40.096
Whoa, I'm sorry. What
are you doing here?

07:40.198 --> 07:42.232
Hello, Jonah. Richard.

07:42.334 --> 07:45.635
- Hi, Catherine.
- When you talk to me, you ruin the film.

07:45.737 --> 07:47.303
Always a pleasure.

07:47.406 --> 07:49.472
I'm here to be your
new campaign manager.

07:49.574 --> 07:51.349
Holy shit, are you here
to beg me for a job?

07:52.043 --> 07:54.344
As director of communication, I
should have been alerted to this.

07:54.446 --> 07:56.312
Uh, why don't you have a seat

07:56.415 --> 07:58.248
and tell me about your job
history and we'll go from there?

07:58.350 --> 08:01.184
From now on, Jonah, you will shut the
fuck up and do exactly as I say.

08:01.286 --> 08:03.486
And if you listen to me instead
of your only two brain cells

08:03.588 --> 08:07.624
busy butt-fucking each other somewhere in
the vast expanses of your misshapen skull,

08:07.726 --> 08:09.793
then maybe, Jonah, you
might have a chance

08:09.895 --> 08:12.729
at becoming the first mentally
impaired Frankenstein's monster

08:12.831 --> 08:14.798
to ever win an American election.

08:14.900 --> 08:17.467
And by the way, your banner makes it
look like your name is Jon H. Ryan,

08:17.569 --> 08:19.369
so great job, communications department.

08:19.471 --> 08:22.872
- I'm taking this office.
- Wait, that's my office.

08:22.974 --> 08:24.641
I got that.

08:25.911 --> 08:27.577
How do you look so good
with all this stress?

08:27.679 --> 08:28.978
You're glowing.

08:29.080 --> 08:30.947
You actually look younger.
What did you do?

08:31.049 --> 08:32.916
Oh, my God, he noticed.

08:33.018 --> 08:34.717
- What?
- Mmm.

08:34.820 --> 08:38.520
Uh, I have a new facial moisturizer.

08:38.623 --> 08:40.590
- <i>Oh.</i>
- And a new soap.

08:40.692 --> 08:42.558
- Gary.
- Yeah, I'll just stand over here.

08:42.660 --> 08:44.427
- Actually, I think...
- I'll just leave the room.

08:44.529 --> 08:45.695
- Yes.
- Yeah.

08:45.797 --> 08:48.565
Listen, Selina, I want to apologize.

08:48.667 --> 08:50.867
I know that our relationship
has compromised your job.

08:50.969 --> 08:52.902
- Yeah.
- But you're the president.

08:53.004 --> 08:55.038
Whatever you decide is best.

08:55.140 --> 08:58.041
And it won't affect our
relationship one way or another.

08:59.544 --> 09:01.678
- Okay.
- Now, enough shoptalk.

09:01.780 --> 09:03.580
- Yeah, no kidding.
- All right.

09:03.682 --> 09:06.316
- Let's talk about something else.
- Yes.

09:09.588 --> 09:11.287
- Do you want to just have sex?
- Yeah.

09:11.389 --> 09:12.722
- Yeah.
- It's got to be quick, though.

09:12.824 --> 09:14.424
I got wheels up at 9:30.

09:14.526 --> 09:16.626
Ooh, that turns me on.

09:20.565 --> 09:22.532
- Hello, ma'am.
<i>- Amy, come to my office.</i>

09:22.634 --> 09:24.167
- Right now?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

09:24.269 --> 09:25.835
Of course.

09:27.372 --> 09:29.906
Set a reminder.

09:30.008 --> 09:32.542
Make an appointment to freeze eggs.

09:34.379 --> 09:36.112
Ma'am, are you okay?

09:36.214 --> 09:39.482
- Amy, how's the investigation going?
- Oh, uh, fine.

09:39.584 --> 09:41.918
I mean, the investigation
of me being called a cunt.

09:42.020 --> 09:43.953
- I knew which one you meant.
- Yeah, good.

09:44.055 --> 09:47.223
Well, it does occur to me that we've
all got a lot on our plates right now.

09:47.325 --> 09:48.075
Yeah.

09:48.100 --> 09:50.350
So I think we should
push this investigation

09:50.428 --> 09:52.462
until after everything...

09:52.564 --> 09:54.163
I want you to fire Gerry Duggan,

09:54.266 --> 09:57.133
Phil Neary and what's her ass, Lisa...

09:57.235 --> 09:58.052
Hatch?

09:58.077 --> 10:00.527
Yeah, I want her out of
the comms department, okay?

10:00.605 --> 10:02.705
Because they should not
have let an article

10:02.807 --> 10:05.642
about me being called a cunt get
out in the first place, right?

10:05.744 --> 10:07.777
- Well, I'm not the person who...
- Fire them.

10:07.879 --> 10:10.680
- Okay.
- I am the first female president

10:10.782 --> 10:13.583
of the United States and
this is an affront.

10:13.685 --> 10:15.351
Yes, ma'am.

10:17.889 --> 10:19.355
I'll tell you something, Amy.

10:19.457 --> 10:22.859
A lot of people don't
want me to be president.

10:22.961 --> 10:27.096
And you know why. Because fundamentally,
people hate women, right?

10:27.198 --> 10:30.266
I mean, they'll just stop at
nothing to get me out of here.

10:30.368 --> 10:33.937
Everybody's trying to get me,
but I'm not gonna let them.

10:34.039 --> 10:36.205
You okay, ma'am?

10:36.308 --> 10:38.007
Have you ever been called a cunt?

10:38.109 --> 10:39.309
Many times.

10:39.411 --> 10:42.645
Well, now I have, too, apparently once.

10:44.916 --> 10:46.616
Hey, Mom, I'm back.

10:46.718 --> 10:49.819
You were gone? Oh, right,
you were in New Hampshire.

10:49.921 --> 10:51.888
- Gary, is now a good time?
- Mm-hmm.

10:51.990 --> 10:54.791
- What? He's not in charge of me.
- Mm-mmm.

10:54.893 --> 10:57.069
I just wanted to know
can we talk for a second?

10:57.094 --> 10:57.818
Yeah.

10:57.896 --> 10:59.596
I feel like since Mee-Maw died,

10:59.698 --> 11:02.198
I've had some time to reflect on things

11:02.300 --> 11:05.535
and, you know, why things didn't
work out between me and Jason.

11:05.637 --> 11:06.371
Uh-huh.

11:06.396 --> 11:08.595
Or the guy in college who
wanted to watch me pee.

11:08.673 --> 11:10.773
Or the guy with the weirdly high voice.

11:10.875 --> 11:13.543
No, there were two guys
with weirdly high voices.

11:13.645 --> 11:14.911
- Yeah, there were two.
- Do you remember?

11:15.013 --> 11:16.913
- I've been trying...
- Madam President.

11:17.015 --> 11:20.483
Yeah? I have to deal with whatever
this is, okay, Catherine?

11:20.585 --> 11:22.619
So we can talk later.

11:22.721 --> 11:24.854
- Guys, I don't want to hear it.
- Ma'am.

11:24.956 --> 11:25.731
Ma'am.

11:25.756 --> 11:28.081
No, guys, you know I'm
not gonna rethink it.

11:28.159 --> 11:29.692
- I've made the decision.
- Madam President!

11:29.794 --> 11:32.128
That is if you'd like for
that to remain your title!

11:32.230 --> 11:34.530
Wow. What?

11:34.633 --> 11:36.299
It's worse than we thought.

11:36.401 --> 11:39.702
I ran the numbers. Approval
rating for bailing out

11:39.804 --> 11:43.740
your sexual partner's financial
establishment... 4.3%.

11:43.842 --> 11:45.274
Hanukah polls higher in Mecca.

11:45.377 --> 11:47.377
But it's the right bank
to bail out, right?

11:47.479 --> 11:50.813
That's right, ma'am, but nobody
understands the economy.

11:50.915 --> 11:53.783
- Literally nobody.
- Not literally.

11:53.885 --> 11:58.187
And then I think we lose three or four
states in Congress just like that.

11:58.289 --> 12:01.424
What would you guys do if you had to
choose between your cock and your balls?

12:01.526 --> 12:05.528
I could lose them both. I mean, at
this stage they're purely decorative.

12:05.630 --> 12:08.431
Guys, you want to go out later for
some Hansong Korean Barbecue?

12:08.533 --> 12:11.567
Korean barbecue is a travesty
and a far cry from authentic.

12:11.670 --> 12:13.970
- I'm his plus one.
- Sue?

12:15.740 --> 12:17.740
That's Korean for "I hate you."

12:17.842 --> 12:19.676
Marjorie?

12:20.845 --> 12:22.311
That is her name, right?

12:23.381 --> 12:26.382
Sorry to do this, everyone.

12:26.484 --> 12:29.485
But I've done some deep soul diving

12:29.587 --> 12:33.056
and we are going to bail
out Paulsten-Berheim.

12:33.158 --> 12:35.224
- Oh, fuck.
<i>- Make that happen.</i>

12:35.326 --> 12:37.760
Thank nonexistent Jesus.

12:41.433 --> 12:43.266
No, I don't know. I don't
want to wear the glasses.

12:43.368 --> 12:44.701
They're part of your relaunch.

12:44.803 --> 12:47.670
They make you look half
smart, you fucking goon.

12:47.772 --> 12:49.872
You know what we call people
like you back in my day?

12:49.974 --> 12:51.841
Retards.

12:51.943 --> 12:54.343
Tom Petty says we can't use
"Won't Back Down" anymore.

12:54.446 --> 12:57.013
Okay, well, fuck him if he
thinks I'm gonna back down.

12:57.115 --> 12:58.881
That's, like, the whole
point of the song.

12:58.983 --> 13:00.717
We got the okay from Gary Glitter,

13:00.819 --> 13:02.785
but he's in jail for child rape,
so maybe not the first choice.

13:02.887 --> 13:04.220
Okay, all right, now listen to me.

13:04.322 --> 13:06.489
Go out there, turn this
thing around, all right?

13:06.591 --> 13:08.324
The widow's beating you by 30 points.

13:08.426 --> 13:10.893
She's a retired second grade
teacher, for Christ's sake.

13:10.995 --> 13:13.096
Yeah, who sucks and gives
too much homework.

13:13.198 --> 13:15.998
- She's your second grade teacher?
- Yeah.

13:16.101 --> 13:18.101
Jonah Ryan, pleasure to meet you.
Thanks for coming out, sir.

13:18.203 --> 13:20.403
Jonah Ryan, running for Congress.
Pleasure to meet you.

13:20.505 --> 13:22.538
Get a picture of me and
this guy's mustache.

13:22.640 --> 13:25.241
Jonah Ryan. Ma'am, I have
some breakfast back there.

13:25.343 --> 13:26.809
You should really try
the corned beef hash.

13:26.911 --> 13:28.478
It's so much more
agreeable than anything

13:28.580 --> 13:30.079
that gets dished out in prison.

13:30.181 --> 13:32.715
Bill. I thought you were in the...

13:32.817 --> 13:34.951
The slammer? My lawyer got
it thrown out on appeal.

13:35.053 --> 13:38.287
O'Brien hired me to be the Widow
Sherman's new campaign manager.

13:38.389 --> 13:40.456
- You're kidding me.
- No, Dan.

13:40.558 --> 13:43.760
One thing you learn in
prison is not to make jokes.

13:43.862 --> 13:46.929
I am fructose intolerant, you nitwit.

13:47.031 --> 13:49.432
I assume what I'm seeing is
the patented Egan touch.

13:49.534 --> 13:51.667
I'll see you on the
campaign trail, amigo.

13:51.770 --> 13:53.770
Tell the president no hard feelings.

13:53.872 --> 13:55.404
Oh, wait, that's right.

13:55.507 --> 13:58.374
I do have hard feelings.
I'm consumed by them.

13:58.476 --> 13:59.942
<i>...we're not in this situation.</i>

14:00.044 --> 14:01.577
This is done. Dan, we got to go.

14:01.679 --> 14:03.946
- Yeah. Yes.
- Dan.

14:05.383 --> 14:06.816
Oh, Catherine.

14:06.918 --> 14:08.985
Honey, you wanted to talk
to me privately before.

14:09.087 --> 14:11.721
- Now is a perfect time.
- Really?

14:11.823 --> 14:15.358
Mm-hmm. Now, what happened to the
boyfriend with the high voice?

14:15.460 --> 14:16.859
He couldn't go to the bathroom?

14:16.961 --> 14:18.895
What it was more about was
just my relationships

14:18.997 --> 14:20.647
and examining a sort
of common pattern...

14:20.672 --> 14:21.221
Ma'am.

14:21.299 --> 14:23.633
- Yeah?
- I wondered... hey, Catherine.

14:23.735 --> 14:25.935
I wondered if you and I could
just have a moment together?

14:26.037 --> 14:27.503
- Privately.
- Definitely.

14:27.605 --> 14:29.972
I'm gonna talk to you later.

14:30.074 --> 14:31.874
Tom, I don't think...

14:31.976 --> 14:34.010
where are you going?

14:34.112 --> 14:35.812
Ma'am, you are known to be

14:35.914 --> 14:38.247
- a very smart political operator.
- I know.

14:38.349 --> 14:41.017
Good afternoon. Hello again.

14:41.119 --> 14:44.420
On second thought, we are
now going to bail out

14:44.522 --> 14:47.824
Charlie and Wheelright. Thank you.

14:47.926 --> 14:49.859
Yeah.

14:49.961 --> 14:51.661
No. You know what?

14:51.763 --> 14:55.164
On third thought, let's just
stick with the plan before.

14:55.266 --> 14:56.933
We're going to bail out Paulsten.

14:57.035 --> 14:59.101
Yeah. Yeah.

14:59.204 --> 15:01.737
So, who had 12:50 P.M.?

15:06.010 --> 15:07.677
Huh, you eat.

15:07.779 --> 15:10.146
I suppose you need something
to nervously shit out.

15:10.248 --> 15:11.914
Hello, Leon. It's always good to see

15:12.016 --> 15:13.983
the most left-swiped face on Tinder.

15:14.085 --> 15:18.020
Busy day. Three people fired
from the communications office.

15:18.122 --> 15:19.522
High turnover department.

15:19.624 --> 15:21.257
Or is a panicky mass firing

15:21.359 --> 15:24.126
because someone called POTUS
a cunt in "Politico"?

15:24.229 --> 15:26.996
Ah, I just blew the lid off of Cuntgate.

15:27.098 --> 15:29.198
- It's not a gate.
- No, it's very much a gate.

15:29.300 --> 15:31.534
- Untrue.
- You should watch out, Amy.

15:31.636 --> 15:33.502
You don't want to be
the face of Cuntgate.

15:33.605 --> 15:36.105
Although you do have the
perfect face for it.

15:37.809 --> 15:39.442
<i>So it spread to the
insurance companies?</i>

15:39.544 --> 15:42.311
- At least three of them.
- <i>Jesus Christ.</i>

15:43.915 --> 15:44.981
Oh, come on.

15:45.083 --> 15:48.284
Good evening. It is me again.

15:48.386 --> 15:51.220
Um, yeah, so I was just talking to Mike

15:51.322 --> 15:55.491
and I definitely want
to bail out Wheelright.

15:55.593 --> 15:57.493
That's a smart play.

15:57.595 --> 16:00.162
Mike! You fucking jagoff.

16:00.265 --> 16:02.164
Is this about the coffee pods?
I swear I was gonna put...

16:02.267 --> 16:04.800
No, you told the president
to bail out Charlie's bank.

16:04.903 --> 16:06.135
No, I didn't say anything about banks.

16:06.237 --> 16:07.737
I was talking to her
about how Wendy paid off

16:07.839 --> 16:09.305
my student loans and
how I love her for it.

16:09.407 --> 16:12.241
You still have student loans?
How old are you?

16:12.343 --> 16:13.709
I'm not good with money.

16:16.981 --> 16:19.215
Now, the widow's gonna get 10
minutes, then you get 10 minutes.

16:19.317 --> 16:21.951
Hi, I'm Jonah Ryan. So happy to be here.
What a great cause.

16:22.053 --> 16:24.820
- Stump speech.
- I'm listening and I'm a doer.

16:24.923 --> 16:27.356
It's good to start with a
joke about a local bigwig

16:27.458 --> 16:29.158
like Mayor Brock is here tonight.

16:29.260 --> 16:31.127
I guess when he had cancer,
the doctors removed

16:31.229 --> 16:33.863
his ability to stop doing
his kid's babysitter.

16:33.965 --> 16:36.866
Seems kind of harsh.

16:36.968 --> 16:38.968
I know New Hampshire.
Trust me, big laugh.

16:39.070 --> 16:40.770
Also, sir, some bands we haven't used

16:40.872 --> 16:42.672
have sent some preemptive
cease-and-desist orders.

16:42.774 --> 16:44.273
Sting, Bruce Springsteen...

16:44.375 --> 16:46.375
sent two letters, actually... and Enya.

16:46.477 --> 16:47.677
Enya?

16:47.779 --> 16:49.845
Send her a fucking
cease-and-desist letter.

16:49.948 --> 16:52.515
- Hello, Jonah.
- Good morning, Mrs. Sherman.

16:52.617 --> 16:56.018
I still remember that
lovely macaroni portrait

16:56.120 --> 16:57.586
you made of your mother.

16:57.689 --> 16:59.622
I don't recall that macaroni
portrait, Mrs. Sherman.

16:59.724 --> 17:01.691
<i>- Please welcome...</i>
- Excuse me, ma'am. You're on.

17:01.793 --> 17:03.696
<i> ...our first speaker, Mrs.
Judy Sherman.</i>

17:04.462 --> 17:05.928
Thank you.

17:06.030 --> 17:08.263
Did you hear that dig about
the macaroni portrait?

17:08.366 --> 17:09.898
Can you fucking believe that?

17:10.001 --> 17:12.335
Hey, we're on a code black.

17:12.436 --> 17:14.971
POTUS is on an opinion shopping spree.
Come on.

17:16.107 --> 17:18.406
Hey, slow down. I'm on Coumadin.

17:18.509 --> 17:21.109
Sue, we need to see the president.

17:21.212 --> 17:23.212
Gentlemen, you'll have
to towel off and wait.

17:23.314 --> 17:24.946
- She's in with someone.
- Who?

17:25.049 --> 17:26.449
Whom.

17:26.550 --> 17:28.351
Come on, Charlie, 100%.

17:28.453 --> 17:30.519
- 100%.
- All right, great.

17:30.621 --> 17:33.222
Now, on the other hand,
bailing out your boyfriend,

17:33.324 --> 17:36.025
I mean, that could be
career-ending, right?

17:37.562 --> 17:39.562
Yeah, right.

17:39.664 --> 17:42.131
But, I mean, if you had
a gun to your head...

17:42.233 --> 17:45.167
Oh, maybe the gun doesn't
have any bullets.

17:45.269 --> 17:47.136
Well, thank you so much for coming.

17:47.238 --> 17:50.206
It was my pleasure. Oh, gentlemen.

17:50.308 --> 17:52.408
Well, that was completely useless.

17:52.510 --> 17:55.811
Ma'am, we need a final
decision right now,

17:55.913 --> 17:57.213
even if it's the wrong one.

17:57.315 --> 18:01.083
I just need a little bit more time.

18:01.185 --> 18:03.486
If we don't put a plan into
action tomorrow morning,

18:03.588 --> 18:05.755
then by Monday we will be Greece.

18:05.857 --> 18:08.057
The country, not the musical.

18:08.159 --> 18:11.027
All right, here's my final decision.

18:11.129 --> 18:14.363
You will have a final
decision by tomorrow morning.

18:14.465 --> 18:16.265
Have both plans ready to go.

18:16.367 --> 18:20.036
Now, I need to get on the phone
with the Israeli prime minister

18:20.138 --> 18:22.004
and then the president of France, okay?

18:22.106 --> 18:23.439
They may give me some insight into this.

18:23.541 --> 18:25.474
Ma'am, instead of that, I got an idea.

18:25.576 --> 18:27.777
You can clear your head out and
have a little fun at the same time.

18:27.879 --> 18:30.312
- What?
- Yeah, I'll call Jonah and Dan

18:30.415 --> 18:32.915
and you can tear them a
six-pack of new assholes.

18:33.017 --> 18:35.785
- Oh, that does sound like fun. Okay.
- Yeah.

18:35.887 --> 18:39.555
But when your husband of 47 years

18:39.657 --> 18:42.358
asks you on his deathbed...

18:42.460 --> 18:46.028
<i> Dan, you're on with the president.</i>

18:46.130 --> 18:48.964
Dan, I cannot fucking believe

18:49.067 --> 18:50.966
how terrible you are at your job.

18:51.069 --> 18:52.635
What, are you running on a platform

18:52.737 --> 18:54.770
of higher taxes and episiotomies?

18:54.872 --> 18:56.639
Ma'am, we just... we need a little time.

18:56.741 --> 19:00.009
Put that world's tallest pile of
garbage on the phone right now.

19:00.111 --> 19:02.344
It's the president.

19:02.447 --> 19:04.447
Fuck...

19:04.549 --> 19:06.449
- Hello, ma'am.
- <i>Hey, hunchback.</i>

19:06.551 --> 19:08.951
I don't know what you've been
doing instead of trying to win,

19:09.053 --> 19:11.587
but I'm gonna guess that it
has the word anal in it.

19:11.689 --> 19:15.257
<i>Now, you learn to control
your cocksucking temper,</i>

19:15.359 --> 19:17.460
otherwise I'm gonna come up there myself

19:17.562 --> 19:20.062
and I'm gonna shoot you
in your fucking mouth.

19:22.166 --> 19:24.567
- She hung up.
- Fuck her.

19:24.669 --> 19:27.203
You know, Selina Meyer is
a second-rate mediocrity

19:27.305 --> 19:29.705
whose only achievement is
single-handedly tanking the economy.

19:29.807 --> 19:32.608
But somehow we're the losers
doing anal with each other?

19:32.710 --> 19:34.643
Her entire presidency has been
one disgrace after another.

19:34.745 --> 19:36.779
- She has never respected me.
- And I'm bad at my fucking job?

19:36.881 --> 19:38.647
- Fuck!
- You know what? That's bullshit.

19:38.749 --> 19:40.449
- You're doing a good job.
- Oh, fuck off.

19:40.551 --> 19:42.685
No, this glasses shit, that was dope.

19:42.787 --> 19:44.820
These look great. That was a great idea.

19:46.657 --> 19:47.990
Go fuck yourself.

19:48.092 --> 19:51.861
And I promise I won't
let anyone get away

19:51.963 --> 19:54.897
with wasting your hard-earned money.

19:57.268 --> 19:59.401
Thank you. Thank you so much.

19:59.504 --> 20:01.370
Thank you.

20:01.472 --> 20:05.407
I want you to go out there and I want
you to kick some New Hampshire ass.

20:06.426 --> 20:08.701
Yo, Granite State. Hey, how you feeling?

20:10.214 --> 20:12.915
I see that Mayor Block
isn't here tonight.

20:13.017 --> 20:15.684
Guess he couldn't get a babysitter.

20:15.786 --> 20:17.419
Or could he?

20:21.893 --> 20:24.994
You suck! Go back to Washington.

20:25.096 --> 20:27.897
I took the liberty of
arranging some hecklers.

20:27.999 --> 20:29.798
- No charge.
- But, yes, I was in Washington.

20:29.901 --> 20:31.734
And I worked a very
high-level, important job.

20:31.836 --> 20:34.036
You helped Selina Meyer
screw up this country.

20:34.138 --> 20:38.007
I think she did a fine job screwing
up the country all by herself.

20:38.109 --> 20:39.775
No, I'm serious.

20:39.877 --> 20:42.778
This is so much more beautiful to
watch than the birth of my child.

20:42.880 --> 20:45.948
Right, she single-handedly
destroyed the economy,

20:46.050 --> 20:48.284
but she doesn't care
because she's too busy

20:48.386 --> 20:50.486
cuddling up to her
billionaire boyfriend.

20:50.588 --> 20:52.388
And I don't know about you,

20:52.490 --> 20:55.758
but my boyfriend's not a billionaire.

20:55.860 --> 20:59.428
Her whole presidency has been
one disgrace after another

20:59.530 --> 21:01.063
and I don't know if you're sick of it,

21:01.165 --> 21:02.798
- but I am definitely sick of it...
- Yes.

21:02.900 --> 21:06.068
...and I'm not just gonna sit
here and take it anymore.

21:06.170 --> 21:07.670
What the fuck?

21:07.772 --> 21:09.104
My name is Jonah Ryan

21:09.207 --> 21:11.674
and I want to be your congressman.

21:11.776 --> 21:14.543
And I won't back down. Thank you.

21:14.645 --> 21:17.179
Thank you very much, Granite State.

21:17.281 --> 21:19.782
You feeling me? Thank you.

21:19.884 --> 21:21.317
Thank you.

21:21.419 --> 21:23.219
<i>- Mike! Mike!</i>
- Wayne.

21:23.321 --> 21:25.654
When will we hear which banks
are gonna get bailout money?

21:25.756 --> 21:28.390
No one is using the term bailout
money except for you, Wayne.

21:28.492 --> 21:31.760
The details for the plan will
be revealed later today.

21:31.862 --> 21:33.429
Leon.

21:33.531 --> 21:35.364
Can you confirm the
allegation of the firing

21:35.466 --> 21:39.101
of three people from the comms office
is tied to See-you-next-Tuesday-gate?

21:39.203 --> 21:42.538
That sort of coarse language is far
beneath the dignity of this room.

21:42.640 --> 21:44.840
- And also it's not a gate.
- Oh, it's a gate.

21:44.942 --> 21:46.642
- <i>No, it is not a gate.</i>
- It's very much a gate.

21:46.744 --> 21:48.410
You know what? We're gonna
elevate the conversation,

21:48.512 --> 21:50.045
go to my friend here at
"The New York Times."

21:50.147 --> 21:52.014
Mike, the "Politico" sidebar suggested

21:52.116 --> 21:53.949
that there was one staffer
who called the president

21:54.051 --> 21:55.751
the worst thing you can call a woman.

21:55.853 --> 21:57.753
- Why were three people fired?
- <i>Okay, that about wraps it up.</i>

21:57.855 --> 21:59.221
Thank you all. No further questions.

21:59.323 --> 22:01.023
Enjoy your evening.

22:01.125 --> 22:04.193
Ben, this is real. The whole room
was sniffing around Cuntgate.

22:04.295 --> 22:05.728
<i>- It's not a gate, Mike.</i>
- No kidding!

22:05.830 --> 22:07.730
It isn't a gate. I agree. I said that.

22:07.832 --> 22:09.698
She's becoming seriously unhinged.

22:09.800 --> 22:11.133
She has gone full metal Nixon.

22:11.235 --> 22:13.235
Who do you think said it?

22:13.337 --> 22:16.739
Well, we did. Me and Mike.

22:16.841 --> 22:18.841
- Oh, my God. I thought it was me.
<i>- No way.</i>

22:18.943 --> 22:22.211
No, I'm pretty sure I called her a cunt
to the reporter who broke the story.

22:23.881 --> 22:26.649
Amy, it's probable that
your investigation

22:26.751 --> 22:30.586
has already determined that I was
the one that called her a cunt.

22:30.688 --> 22:33.455
I'm hoping that my utility
to the organization

22:33.557 --> 22:35.090
gives you reason to protect me on this.

22:35.192 --> 22:37.326
Also our friendship.

22:37.428 --> 22:39.061
<i>- Hey, Ben?</i>

22:39.163 --> 22:40.896
Gary.

22:40.998 --> 22:43.899
It was me. I called the
president the C word.

22:44.001 --> 22:45.501
<i>- No, you didn't.</i>
- Really?

22:45.603 --> 22:47.903
I was so mad about her
not wearing sunscreen,

22:48.005 --> 22:50.039
which is stupid, and I was like,

22:50.141 --> 22:51.674
"What an old crone."

22:51.776 --> 22:53.409
A what?

22:53.511 --> 22:56.779
An old crone, Amy.

22:56.881 --> 22:59.181
Gary, C is for cunt.

22:59.283 --> 23:00.783
What?

23:00.885 --> 23:02.351
We all called her a cunt.

23:02.453 --> 23:04.219
Oh, my God!

23:04.322 --> 23:06.221
What is wrong with you people?

23:06.324 --> 23:08.190
Oh, Madam President. Welcome.

23:08.292 --> 23:11.060
I've made my final decision.

23:12.163 --> 23:13.796
I'm gonna bail out Charlie.

23:13.898 --> 23:16.865
Madam President, you really don't
have to make that decision yet.

23:16.967 --> 23:19.101
- I mean, you got a little bit more time.
- I don't need more time.

23:19.203 --> 23:21.670
It's best for our country's economy.

23:21.772 --> 23:23.305
That's the end of it.

23:23.407 --> 23:24.940
<i>So you're gonna go talk to Treasury,</i>

23:25.042 --> 23:27.843
I'm gonna go tell Tom. Done. Okay?

23:27.945 --> 23:29.545
- Right?
- Yes, ma'am.

23:32.450 --> 23:35.384
Hey, ma'am, I know you made
the right choice with Charlie

23:35.486 --> 23:37.920
because when you have
found someone you love,

23:38.022 --> 23:41.056
who makes you feel special
every time he talks to you

23:41.158 --> 23:44.259
and you can be happy just
thinking about him, you know...

23:44.362 --> 23:47.129
I mean, that's more important
than anything, you know?

23:47.231 --> 23:49.064
Yeah.

23:51.936 --> 23:54.336
- Good morning.
- Morning, ma'am.

23:54.438 --> 23:55.804
Madam President.

23:55.906 --> 23:57.773
What brings you here?

23:57.875 --> 23:59.241
Let's do this.

24:01.278 --> 24:03.712
<i>Madam President, what
will you be buying for Mr. Baird?</i>

24:03.814 --> 24:05.814
I don't want to spoil Charlie's surprise

24:05.916 --> 24:07.616
under the tree...

24:07.718 --> 24:10.753
but I'm going to be
purchasing a book of poetry

24:10.855 --> 24:13.922
by one of my favorite African-American
poets, Wanda Coleman.

24:14.024 --> 24:15.958
And I've got my eye on a graphic novel

24:16.060 --> 24:18.560
with a very strong female
Asian protagonist.

24:18.662 --> 24:20.229
So, merry Chris...

24:20.331 --> 24:22.664
happy holidays to everybody, right?

24:22.767 --> 24:25.667
- Right.
- And let's go shopping. Thank you.

24:25.770 --> 24:27.469
Please don't get me a
book for Christmas.

24:27.571 --> 24:31.006
I already have a book.

24:31.108 --> 24:33.475
It's Tom James. I should
actually take this.

24:33.577 --> 24:35.644
No, no, that wasn't
supposed to come now.

24:35.746 --> 24:37.579
Hey, ma'am. Catherine keeps calling.

24:37.681 --> 24:40.249
- Do you want to take it?
- Uh, what?

24:40.351 --> 24:41.984
- No, just let it ring.
- Okay.

24:42.086 --> 24:43.719
I don't know why she keeps calling.

24:43.821 --> 24:44.987
When were you gonna let me know?

24:45.089 --> 24:47.356
- I...
- I'm Chapter 11.

24:47.458 --> 24:48.891
Janders is buying my assets.

24:48.993 --> 24:51.026
I'm CEO of a fucking yard sale.

24:51.128 --> 24:53.028
- Hey, Charlie, you know what?
- How could you fucking do this to me?

24:53.130 --> 24:55.063
- What do you mean?
- "Politico" was right about you.

24:55.166 --> 24:56.865
- No, Charlie...
- Hey, you said it wouldn't affect...

24:56.967 --> 24:59.001
<i>I know you had an eye job.</i>

25:04.909 --> 25:07.142
You made the right call
on the banks, ma'am.

25:07.244 --> 25:09.745
Well, you can thank "When
Gary Met Sally" for that one.

25:09.847 --> 25:11.880
He gave me some sappy speech

25:11.982 --> 25:14.149
and made me realize what
an idiot I was being.

25:14.251 --> 25:17.352
In further good news, ma'am,
Jonah had a huge polling bump

25:17.455 --> 25:19.154
since he hit on the
strategy of attacking you.

25:19.256 --> 25:20.823
What? He's attacking me?

25:20.925 --> 25:22.591
Yeah, and the voters, they love it.

25:22.693 --> 25:24.860
- Is that good?
- It's really good.

25:24.962 --> 25:27.496
Oh. Hey, Sue, did Charlie call?

25:27.598 --> 25:29.331
- No, ma'am.
- Okay.

25:29.433 --> 25:31.934
Mom, there's something that I really
need to find a way to say to you.

25:32.036 --> 25:34.303
Catherine, I'm in the middle
of a shitstorm like...

25:34.405 --> 25:36.805
Please, I've been trying to talk to you for
three days and I need to tell you something.

25:36.907 --> 25:39.741
What is it, Catherine? What
is it that is so pressing?

25:39.844 --> 25:43.278
I've met someone and I
know that this is awkward

25:43.380 --> 25:45.814
because you work with them,

25:45.916 --> 25:48.283
but we're in love.

25:48.385 --> 25:49.418
Who?

25:49.520 --> 25:51.587
Me and Marjorie.

25:51.689 --> 25:53.188
Who?

25:53.290 --> 25:55.624
Me, ma'am.

25:55.726 --> 25:57.626
What?

25:57.728 --> 26:01.263
Now you know why I've been
acting all silly and giggly.

26:01.365 --> 26:03.031
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:03.133 --> 26:04.766
We figured you guessed already.

26:04.869 --> 26:06.101
I mean, I know it's so obvious.

26:06.203 --> 26:08.036
Didn't guess. Didn't guess.

26:08.138 --> 26:10.606
- I...
- Amazing.

26:10.708 --> 26:12.941
It's... amazing.

26:13.043 --> 26:14.610
I've told Director Parker

26:14.712 --> 26:17.412
I'll be resigning from
your detail immediately.

26:19.350 --> 26:21.450
Okay, I'm just gonna need

26:21.552 --> 26:26.088
a little moment to process
all of this, girls.

26:26.190 --> 26:27.689
<i>Of course, ma'am.</i>

26:27.791 --> 26:29.458
But I'm happy for you.

26:29.560 --> 26:32.261
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Thanks, Mom.

26:32.363 --> 26:34.396
- I love you.
- Thank you.

26:40.271 --> 26:42.538
- Uh...
- What...

26:45.543 --> 26:47.342
I wish Mother were alive.

26:49.146 --> 26:52.047
'Cause this definitely
would have killed her.

26:52.149 --> 26:55.651
- You know how she was.
- Mm-hmm.

26:57.388 --> 26:59.121
<i>- Ma'am, is this a good time?</i>
- You bet.

26:59.223 --> 27:02.524
The investigation continues
at a rigorous pace.

27:02.626 --> 27:05.661
- So who called me a cunt?
- Uh...

27:05.763 --> 27:08.163
- Was it everybody?
- Pretty much, yeah.

27:08.265 --> 27:09.898
You can go.

27:16.340 --> 27:17.439
- Ma'am...
- No.

27:17.541 --> 27:19.074
Okay.

27:23.914 --> 27:26.815
Hi, called ahead for $100
worth of food to go.

27:26.917 --> 27:29.751
Under McLintock.

27:29.853 --> 27:31.453
And I'll be using a Groupon.

27:31.555 --> 27:34.122
- We don't take Groupon.
- You have to take Groupon.

27:34.224 --> 27:36.091
I already paid money
for this Groupon, sir.

27:36.193 --> 27:39.461
No Groupon. Total is $184.12.

27:39.563 --> 27:42.664
Whoa, I told the guy on the
phone $100 worth of food.

27:42.766 --> 27:44.466
Where's this $89 coming from?

27:44.568 --> 27:46.201
That's your problem, sir.

27:46.303 --> 27:48.303
God.

27:48.405 --> 27:51.607
Shit! Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

27:57.581 --> 27:59.414
No, no, no, no.

28:07.858 --> 28:09.757
I can't stop smiling.

28:09.781 --> 28:10.868
Neither can I.

28:11.841 --> 28:13.015
I'm *
