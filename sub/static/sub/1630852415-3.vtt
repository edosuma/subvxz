[in Mandarin]
[Yu En] "Jian turned to the window

04:43.958 --> 04:49.375
and looked out at the great ship
moored in the harbor.

04:50.875 --> 04:54.791
We will see each other again, Father.

04:55.875 --> 04:58.375
I promise."

04:59.083 --> 05:00.416
[Yu En exhales]

05:00.500 --> 05:01.666
[in English] Shen May.

05:02.166 --> 05:03.208
Grandfather.

05:05.166 --> 05:08.166
I used to read this to him
when he was a child.

05:08.958 --> 05:10.458
It soothes him now.

05:12.041 --> 05:13.375
[Yu En] Come closer.

05:14.291 --> 05:16.416
Let him see your face.

-[door bangs]
-[Leon grunts]

05:21.875 --> 05:23.458

05:29.250 --> 05:30.166
[Shen May] Hao Ran.

05:31.291 --> 05:32.500
[Leon] Try it, pal.

05:38.666 --> 05:40.416
Whenever you're ready.

05:41.666 --> 05:43.916
[machine beeps]

05:45.375 --> 05:48.291
[Shen May] The man lying here is Jun See.

05:52.791 --> 05:54.000
He's my little brother.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.416
[tense music playing]

05:58.416 --> 06:00.833
The US Government turned him into this.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.083
[heavy breathing]

06:06.083 --> 06:07.708
What are you and Jason up to?

06:09.875 --> 06:11.583
Like he told you before…

06:13.416 --> 06:15.625
we're trying to expose a conspiracy.

06:16.500 --> 06:19.500
I came here to get the proof
to out Defense Secretary Wilson

06:19.583 --> 06:20.666
as the one behind it.

06:21.541 --> 06:24.000
[Jason] …a visual on Alpha Two
and it's going down.

06:24.083 --> 06:28.083
Coordinates 4-2-Sierra-Whiskey
Alpha-niner-4-6-5-0-6-7-niner-2-niner.

06:28.166 --> 06:30.041
Tell the other units to stand by.

06:30.125 --> 06:33.125
[Shen May] Team Three, Team Six,
this is Command. Stand by.

06:33.916 --> 06:35.125
[keyboards clacking]

06:35.208 --> 06:40.000
I repeat, Team Three and Team Six,
stand by and wait for orders.

06:44.500 --> 06:46.666
[Wilson] Use MK77's to sterilize the site.

06:46.750 --> 06:48.666
[Colonel] But we still have
a unit in there.

06:48.750 --> 06:50.333
They won't make it out in time.

06:50.416 --> 06:54.208
Everything in the area
is considered infected. Burn it all.

06:54.916 --> 06:55.916
[Colonel] Yes, sir.

06:56.000 --> 07:02.541
MK is ready for drop in three,
and two, and one.

07:03.625 --> 07:04.708
[operator] Touchdown.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.875
[Jason] We made it to a tent
outside the city. Pinging our coordinates.

07:08.958 --> 07:11.875
We got an ID on one survivor, too.
His name is Jun See.

07:11.958 --> 07:12.958
[muffled gasp]

07:13.041 --> 07:15.708
[Jason] Mad Dogs to Command. Need evac.

07:15.791 --> 07:18.791
[ominous music]

07:19.583 --> 07:22.708
[MD 1] …dragged 'em out, killed 'em all.
They turned into that.

07:22.791 --> 07:25.875
[-MD 2] We need to tell somebody.
-[MD 3] Command dropped MK77s on the town.

07:25.958 --> 07:27.833
They wanted to burn
everything, including us.

07:27.916 --> 07:29.333
If we talk, we're dead.

07:29.416 --> 07:30.416
[MD 4] Shit.

07:30.500 --> 07:31.375
[Shen May gasps]

07:31.458 --> 07:32.625
[Jason] Hold your fire.

07:35.166 --> 07:36.333
Who are you?

07:37.916 --> 07:41.041
Warrant Officer Fifth Class,
Shen May, sir.

07:41.666 --> 07:42.750
What are you doing here?

07:44.375 --> 07:46.416
I was going over
your last transmissions and--

07:46.500 --> 07:47.875
[strange growling]

08:36.958 --> 08:39.083
-[machine beeping]
-[Jun See breathing]

08:39.166 --> 08:42.708
[Shen May] Jun See was with
a special squad on a top-secret mission.

08:43.916 --> 08:47.333
Wilson, a major general at the time,
was the commanding officer.

08:48.500 --> 08:51.458
But he was also working
with a pharmaceutical company

08:51.541 --> 08:54.833
to make bio-organic weapons
for military use.

08:57.125 --> 09:00.500
And Penamstan was just a test-run
for his bioweapons.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.291
[sighs] Son of a bitch.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.416
-[insects chirping]
-[Claire hums in wonder]

09:08.500 --> 09:11.250
[Claire] So they all committed suicide.

09:12.541 --> 09:13.916
[sharp exhale]

09:20.916 --> 09:22.458
[Claire sighs]

09:24.791 --> 09:25.916
[paper rustles]

09:28.500 --> 09:30.458

[helicopter whirring]

09:38.000 --> 09:40.291
[men grunting]

09:40.375 --> 09:42.291
[Jason] Okay, he's still alive.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.750

09:44.833 --> 09:46.833
-[grenade clinks]
-[man grunts]

09:46.916 --> 09:48.958
[loud explosion]

09:49.958 --> 09:52.625
[MD 1] Command. This is Mad Dogs.
We need evac for seven.

09:52.708 --> 09:54.625
We got one survivor,
and he's torn to shit.

09:54.708 --> 09:56.708
Hostiles inbound. Get us out of here.

09:57.583 --> 09:58.583
Fuck.

09:59.083 --> 10:02.291
-[groaning]
-Hang on, brother. Help's on the way.

10:06.958 --> 10:08.708
[dogs barking in distance]

10:08.791 --> 10:11.458
This guy does not have long.

10:12.958 --> 10:14.541
[Jason exhales]

10:20.208 --> 10:21.208
Hey, brother.

10:21.916 --> 10:22.833
What's your name?

10:23.375 --> 10:24.833
Jun See.

10:26.083 --> 10:28.666
Jun See, I'm gonna level with you.

10:29.750 --> 10:31.041
There's no rescue.

10:32.125 --> 10:34.250
We're… we're on our own.

10:35.416 --> 10:36.416
But here's the deal.

10:37.500 --> 10:39.416
We're gonna carry you back to base.

10:40.291 --> 10:42.166
But we might have to gag you.

10:42.250 --> 10:44.208
-[MD 4] Something's up out there.
-[Jason grunts]

10:44.291 --> 10:47.291
[tense music]

10:48.041 --> 10:49.333
[exhales]

10:49.416 --> 10:50.958
[MD 3] Where'd that body go?

10:51.041 --> 10:53.166
[zombies growling]

10:54.625 --> 10:56.500
[snarling]

10:56.583 --> 10:58.333

-[gun firing]

11:23.500 --> 11:25.375
[rapid gunfire continues]

11:30.750 --> 11:32.291
[MD 3] He fucking bit me!

11:33.958 --> 11:36.041
-[pained scream]
-[thwacks]

11:36.125 --> 11:38.166
[wood clatters]

11:40.916 --> 11:44.000
-[Jason] Hold your fire!
-[soldiers panting]

11:44.083 --> 11:47.375
What the fuck was that? Fuck!

11:49.291 --> 11:50.375
[MD 1] What are they?

11:50.458 --> 11:53.000
[heavy breathing]

11:56.875 --> 11:58.416
[Jun See groans]

12:05.500 --> 12:07.166
Inject…

12:07.250 --> 12:09.458
[struggled breathing]

12:12.166 --> 12:14.500
-…inhibitor.
-What?

12:17.250 --> 12:18.500
Bag.

12:18.583 --> 12:19.916
[exhales]

12:21.500 --> 12:23.500
[zipper rasps]

12:24.000 --> 12:25.791
[Jun See] You're bitten.

12:29.000 --> 12:29.916
Inject…

12:32.958 --> 12:35.125
-[Jason] Why?
-…inhibitor…

12:37.625 --> 12:39.958
or you'll turn like them.

12:42.083 --> 12:43.666
[gasps]

12:46.708 --> 12:49.333
Hurry. [groans]

12:49.416 --> 12:52.916
[grim music]

12:53.000 --> 12:55.833
[dispatcher speaking
indistinctly over radio]

12:58.125 --> 13:00.125
[cop] Witness is Claire Redfield. Female.

13:00.208 --> 13:02.500
Looks like the deceased
has been dead for a few days.

13:02.583 --> 13:04.958
Shotgun found on the site.
It appears self-inflicted.

13:05.041 --> 13:07.416
[siren wailing]

13:07.500 --> 13:10.708
Ma'am, a detective will contact you
in the next day or so.

13:13.833 --> 13:16.041
[wind blows]

13:17.291 --> 13:18.666
[exhales]

13:20.833 --> 13:22.916
Oh they were infected.

13:24.500 --> 13:29.083
-[Jun See growling]
-[zipper rasps]

13:31.583 --> 13:33.916
Jun See let us use
his share of the inhibitor.

13:35.791 --> 13:37.333
And then he turned into that.

13:41.666 --> 13:43.541
[sighs]

13:47.958 --> 13:49.250
[Jason] All right.

13:50.041 --> 13:52.083
Some of you guys might not like
what I'm thinking.

13:53.583 --> 13:54.875
But it is what it is.

13:55.791 --> 13:56.833
I gotta do this.

13:57.625 --> 13:59.208
And if you don't want any part of it,

14:00.041 --> 14:03.416
well, no harm, no foul.

14:05.166 --> 14:08.666
[Shen May] Jason decided
not to tell HQ about Jun See.

14:09.291 --> 14:11.541
He contacted our grandfather instead.

14:12.375 --> 14:15.625
Since Grandfather is the head
of a conglomerate here in Shanghai,

14:16.291 --> 14:18.250
he used his connections

14:18.333 --> 14:19.500
to smuggle Jun See out.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.583
The Mad Dogs unit returned to base.

14:23.666 --> 14:27.166
And Wilson gave them
a hero's welcome, medals and all.

14:27.666 --> 14:29.583
[Shen May] As long
as they took the inhibitor,

14:29.666 --> 14:32.083
they'd stay alive and they wouldn't turn.

14:32.583 --> 14:35.041
And Wilson supplied the inhibitor.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.583
He held that over their heads

14:38.333 --> 14:42.000
and used the Mad Dogs Unit
for personal, covert operations.

14:43.166 --> 14:44.625
They were Wilson's pets.

14:45.125 --> 14:48.375
[Leon] And thanks to them,
he got promoted to Defense Secretary.

14:49.125 --> 14:50.250
[Shen May] Exactly.

14:52.291 --> 14:54.916
Even though he's a senior US official now,

14:55.000 --> 14:57.708
he continues developing bioweapons

14:57.791 --> 15:00.125
with some pharmaceutical company
on the side.

15:00.916 --> 15:03.333
We still haven't figured it out
who they are yet.

15:03.916 --> 15:06.208
But Wilson wants to be rich and powerful,

15:06.291 --> 15:08.916
and the inhibitor is his key
to that kingdom.

15:09.791 --> 15:12.375
Then Wilson forced Jason
to start the outbreak at the White House

15:12.458 --> 15:14.041
and sabotage the sub.

15:14.625 --> 15:16.625
Just to get the President
pissed off enough at China

15:16.708 --> 15:19.083
to start a war.
[exasperated sigh]

15:19.166 --> 15:22.500
When I smuggled Jun See out of Penamstan,

15:23.583 --> 15:27.875
the virus had transformed him
so much, I could not recognize him.

15:34.583 --> 15:38.541
[Yu En] I have spent my life savings
to find a way to rid him

15:38.625 --> 15:42.250
of the thing that is eating away at him.

15:43.583 --> 15:45.708
-[liquid squeaking]
-I failed you.

15:46.541 --> 15:48.708
[Jun See wheezing]

15:49.500 --> 15:52.041
[delicate music playing]

15:54.250 --> 15:56.208
[sighs]

15:57.333 --> 15:59.833
[Shen May] I went looking
for evidence against Wilson,

15:59.916 --> 16:01.750
because I wanted revenge.

16:02.250 --> 16:04.916
Jason wanted out
from under Wilson's control,

16:05.000 --> 16:06.541
so I decided to work with him.

16:08.083 --> 16:10.416
-[bookshelf rasps]
-And after six years of digging,

16:10.500 --> 16:13.333
we realized the proof
we needed to bring Wilson down

16:13.416 --> 16:15.333
was right under our noses.

16:16.750 --> 16:21.250
All of the prototype bioweapon soldiers
had chips embedded in their bodies.

16:21.333 --> 16:23.666
Those chips were designed
to record their vitals

16:23.750 --> 16:26.250
as well as all their combat data.

16:26.833 --> 16:28.208
A chip, huh?

16:28.291 --> 16:30.791
[Shen May] Everything about Jun See
is recorded on that.

16:30.875 --> 16:34.166
Including who created him
and who sent him into battle.

16:35.125 --> 16:36.125
Burn it all.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.291
He thinks all the evidence
was burned to ash.

16:44.208 --> 16:45.416
Including your brother.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.750
[Shen May] Jason believed that
if we went public with this,

16:52.833 --> 16:56.750
we could expose Wilson and put an end
to the development of bioweapons.

16:57.583 --> 16:58.583
And him.

17:01.291 --> 17:03.208
-[loud crash]
-[gasps]

17:03.291 --> 17:06.541
-[earth rumbling]
-[Shen May] Hao Ran!

17:10.208 --> 17:12.666
[glass shatters]

17:17.291 --> 17:18.583
We gotta go. Now!

17:19.250 --> 17:20.791
-Grandfather! Jun See!
-[machine beeping]

17:21.750 --> 17:24.916
[Shen May] No! Grandfather! Jun See!

17:25.833 --> 17:28.875
-Come on! Move!
-Grandfather! Jun See!

17:30.083 --> 17:31.250
[Shen May] No!

17:37.791 --> 17:39.541
[Ryan scoffs]

17:39.625 --> 17:41.375
[Ryan] I don't know.

17:41.458 --> 17:45.166
This speech is a bit, uh, provocative.

17:45.750 --> 17:48.166
The Chinese are not going to be happy.

17:48.250 --> 17:49.750
The President has agreed with me

17:49.833 --> 17:51.833
on the significance
of taking a firm stand.

17:51.916 --> 17:55.166
I… I think we need to tread carefully.

17:55.833 --> 17:59.458
The US and China have managed
to get along fine up until this point.

18:00.666 --> 18:03.125
[Ryan] If the President says
any of this, it'll be like…

18:03.208 --> 18:06.583
-poking a rattlesnake with a stick.
-[paper rustles]

18:07.416 --> 18:10.708
I can't imagine what this would do
to the world economy,

18:10.791 --> 18:12.750
not to mention the potential for a war.

18:12.833 --> 18:15.083
-[Wilson] Hacking. Viral terrorism.
-[sighs]

18:15.166 --> 18:18.750
Blowing up one of our subs.
Allies do not do these things.

18:18.833 --> 18:20.958
We don't even know
if they did any of that.

18:21.041 --> 18:24.333
Did you forget about
the civil war in Penamstan?

18:24.416 --> 18:26.125
The Chinese played a part in that.

18:26.208 --> 18:28.291
-Right, but--
-[Wilson] But nothing!

18:28.875 --> 18:30.875
This alliance with the Penamstanis

18:30.958 --> 18:33.750
means our military
will finally have a foothold there.

18:34.416 --> 18:37.541
Geographically,
it is between China and the West.

18:37.625 --> 18:40.791
Tactically, it means we can put pressure
on China if it should come to that.

18:40.875 --> 18:43.375
And, one day, it will.

18:44.041 --> 18:45.541
We need to be ready.

18:46.541 --> 18:49.500
We need to show the world
that we are a strong nation,

18:49.583 --> 18:53.166
capable of protecting
the interests of the free world.

18:54.208 --> 18:57.625
[grim music]

18:57.708 --> 18:59.916
[frustrated exhale]

19:04.666 --> 19:06.708
[fire roars]

19:09.541 --> 19:11.083
[Leon groans]

19:18.833 --> 19:20.750
[grunts]

19:21.625 --> 19:24.458
[eerie music playing]

19:26.333 --> 19:27.333
Jason.

19:31.791 --> 19:34.958
[Claire] Secretary Wilson,
I work for an NGO in Penamstan.

19:35.041 --> 19:36.083
What do you want?

19:36.166 --> 19:38.625
I want to know the truth
about the Mad Dogs Unit.

19:38.708 --> 19:41.541
Look, if you want an interview,
you'll have to run it by my people first.

19:41.625 --> 19:44.666
I found a note from one of the soldiers
who committed suicide.

19:46.291 --> 19:49.375
[grim music]

19:55.250 --> 19:58.708
[ominous music]

20:08.750 --> 20:11.458
[Jason] Remember when I told you
about terror?

20:13.416 --> 20:15.041
It starts with fear.

20:16.166 --> 20:19.041
You cultivate it, and you watch it spread,

20:20.208 --> 20:21.083
and then…

20:21.958 --> 20:23.708
then you've got terror.

20:26.041 --> 20:29.041
[ominous music continues]

20:35.666 --> 20:36.791
Give me the chip.

20:38.375 --> 20:39.750
If we go public with it,

20:40.333 --> 20:42.833
everything that Wilson has been doing
will be out in the open.

20:42.916 --> 20:46.166
If I do that, you'll have every agent
in the US hunting you.

20:46.250 --> 20:47.625
-[sighs]
-I have to do it,

20:48.208 --> 20:51.208
so that everything that happened
to Jun See will never happen again.

20:54.125 --> 20:55.916
I know you understand.

20:57.208 --> 20:59.000
Raccoon City was the beginning.

21:02.125 --> 21:04.791
We can't let what happened
in Penamstan stay buried.

21:08.375 --> 21:10.500
Jason wants justice.

21:10.583 --> 21:13.958
No. Jason doesn't give
a damn about justice.

21:15.833 --> 21:18.500
He wants the world to know
what real terror's like.

21:19.291 --> 21:20.875
The kind him and his men knew.

21:22.250 --> 21:25.166
He wants that to be the new reality
for everyone, and then…

21:26.291 --> 21:29.083
-he wants to burn it all down.
-He wouldn't do that.

21:30.833 --> 21:31.833
Look around you.

21:36.791 --> 21:40.041
[dramatic music]

21:47.375 --> 21:48.500
Shen May…

21:50.500 --> 21:51.875
where is he?

21:53.708 --> 21:56.916
[dramatic music continues]

22:02.125 --> 22:04.375
-[siren wailing in distance]
-[Claire exhales]

22:07.375 --> 22:08.833
-[power shuts down]
-[gasps]

22:11.125 --> 22:14.333
[eerie music]

22:19.958 --> 22:21.916
[doorknob creaks]

22:28.750 --> 22:30.750
[door squeaks]

22:37.750 --> 22:38.708
[door thuds]

22:38.791 --> 22:41.416
-[aggressive grunt]
-[thwacks]

22:41.500 --> 22:43.916
[wallops]

22:46.083 --> 22:48.375
-[Taser zapping]
-[Claire shouting in pain]
