WEBVTT

01:42.812 --> 01:45.607
I'D GIVE ANYTHING TO RIDE
ON A TRAIN LIKE THAT.

01:45.774 --> 01:46.858
MARY'S BEEN ON ONE.

01:47.025 --> 01:47.942
YOU HAVE?

01:48.109 --> 01:49.819
UH-HUH. ALL THE WAY
TO MINNEAPOLIS.

01:49.986 --> 01:51.070
YOU'RE LUCKY.

01:51.237 --> 01:52.864
AND IT HAD AN OUTHOUSE
ON IT AND EVERYTHING.

01:53.031 --> 01:53.907
LAURA...

01:54.073 --> 01:54.991
WELL, THAT'S
WHAT YOU SAID.

01:55.158 --> 01:56.534
NEVER MIND. COME ON.

01:56.701 --> 01:58.953
WE BETTER KEEP WALKING
OR WE'LL BE LATE.

02:03.249 --> 02:04.918
Carl: YOUR PA GOING TO
SPRINGFIELD NEXT WEEK?

02:05.084 --> 02:06.795
Mary: SURE. HE'S GOING
WITH YOUR PA.

02:06.961 --> 02:08.129
I WISH
WE COULD GO.

02:08.296 --> 02:10.006
I WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO GET ON THE TRAIN,

02:10.173 --> 02:11.758
BUT AT LEAST I COULD
SEE IT UP CLOSE.

02:11.925 --> 02:13.384
WHY DON'T
YOU ASK HIM?

02:13.551 --> 02:15.428
WOULDN'T
DO NO GOOD.

02:15.595 --> 02:17.597
I'D MISS
A SCHOOL DAY.

02:17.764 --> 02:19.349
BUT WE'RE
STUDYING RAILROADS.

02:19.516 --> 02:22.519
LT'D JUST BE LIKE
SOME EXTRA SPECIAL HOMEWORK.

02:22.685 --> 02:23.603
YEAH!

02:23.770 --> 02:25.188
MARY CAN ASK
OUR PA.

02:25.355 --> 02:26.231
WHY ME?

02:26.397 --> 02:28.358
BECAUSE YOU CAN
PUT YOUR GLASSES ON

02:28.525 --> 02:31.319
AND LOOK SERIOUS
WHEN YOU ASK HIM.

02:31.486 --> 02:34.823
IF I ASK HIM, HE'LL THINK I
JUST WANT TO GO FOR FUN.

02:36.449 --> 02:38.034
PLEASE, MARY.

02:38.201 --> 02:39.828
I KNOW IF YOUR
PA SAYS YES,

02:39.994 --> 02:41.287
MINE WILL, TOO.

02:41.454 --> 02:42.539
PLEASE, MARY.

02:42.705 --> 02:44.874
WELL, ALL RIGHT.

02:45.041 --> 02:45.959
I'LL TRY.

02:46.125 --> 02:48.211
THANKS, MARY.

02:53.842 --> 02:54.801
Mary: PA,
GUESS WHAT.

02:54.968 --> 02:56.302
YOU SAW
AN ELEPHANT.

02:56.469 --> 02:58.471
NO. WE'RE STUDYING TRAINS
AND RAILROADS IN SCHOOL.

02:58.638 --> 03:00.098
WE GOT A WONDERFUL IDEA
HOW TO GET EXTRA CREDIT.

03:00.265 --> 03:01.474
OH, YEAH?
WHAT'S THAT?

03:01.641 --> 03:02.934
WE THOUGHT WE'D GO WITH YOU AND MR.
EDWARDS

03:03.101 --> 03:04.644
TO SPRINGFIELD AND LEARN
ALL ABOUT TRAINS.

03:04.811 --> 03:06.062
YOU ALWAYS SAY THERE'S
NOTHING BETTER THAN

03:06.229 --> 03:07.313
SEEING THINGS
FIRSTHAND.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.065
HEY, HOLD ON, NOW.
YOU'D BE MISSING SCHOOL.

03:09.232 --> 03:12.151
NOT REALLY, PA. lT'D BE JUST
LIKE SCHOOL, ONLY DIFFERENT.

03:12.318 --> 03:13.778
WE COULD
LEARN A LOT.

03:13.945 --> 03:17.156
WELL, YOU CAN LEARN JUST AS
MUCH BY GOING TO SCHOOL.

03:17.323 --> 03:19.325
YOU CAN LEARN EVERYTHING
YOU HAVE TO KNOW.

03:21.494 --> 03:24.914
BUT MR. EDWARDS
IS LETTING CARL GO.

03:26.958 --> 03:27.917
OH, HE IS?

03:28.084 --> 03:30.545
YEAH. I GUESS HE'LL BE

03:30.712 --> 03:33.172
THE ONLY ONE
GETTING EXTRA CREDIT.

03:33.339 --> 03:35.884
CARL, WHAT DID
YOUR MA SAY ABOUT THAT?

03:37.468 --> 03:38.344
WELL...

03:38.511 --> 03:41.139
SHE DIDN'T
SAY ANYTHING.

03:41.306 --> 03:44.058
HMM. WELL, IF GRACE
THINKS IT'S ALL RIGHT,

03:44.225 --> 03:46.394
I GUESS I SHOULDN'T STAND IN
THE WAY OF HIGHER EDUCATION.

03:46.561 --> 03:47.729
YOU CAN GO.

03:47.896 --> 03:48.813
- THANKS, PA.
- THANKS, PA.

03:48.980 --> 03:50.648
COME ON.

03:50.815 --> 03:52.442

HAVE LIED.

03:52.609 --> 03:53.526
I DIDN'T YET.

03:53.693 --> 03:54.861
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU DIDN'T?

03:55.028 --> 03:56.821
YOU SAID MR. EDWARDS
SAID CARL COULD GO,

03:56.988 --> 03:58.197
AND THAT HIS MA
DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

03:58.364 --> 03:59.532
WELL, ALL WE HAVE
TO DO IS ASK HIM.

03:59.699 --> 04:01.409
IF HE SAYS CARL CAN
GO, I DIDN'T LIE.

04:01.576 --> 04:02.994
YOUR MA DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT IT, DID SHE CARL?

04:03.161 --> 04:04.704
OF COURSE NOT.
SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW YET.

04:04.871 --> 04:08.750
THERE. YOU SEE? ALL WE HAVE
TO DO IS GET HIM TO SAY YES.

04:13.379 --> 04:14.047
PA?

04:14.213 --> 04:16.257
Edwards:
WE'RE IN HERE.

04:17.342 --> 04:18.927
GO ON.

04:29.395 --> 04:30.980
HEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THE NEW CURTAINS?

04:31.147 --> 04:32.315
Laura:
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.

04:32.482 --> 04:33.691
WELL, OF COURSE
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.

04:33.858 --> 04:35.026
YOU KNOW, I DID A LOT
OF THE SEWING ON TH--

04:35.193 --> 04:37.028
FACT IS,
I DID MOST OF IT.

04:37.195 --> 04:38.196
HEH HEH!

04:38.363 --> 04:39.322
- PA?
- YEAH?

04:39.489 --> 04:40.573
CAN I ASK
YOU A QUESTION?

04:40.740 --> 04:41.532
SURE.
FIRE AWAY.

04:41.699 --> 04:42.909
WELL,
WE'RE STUDYING

04:43.076 --> 04:45.453
ABOUT TRAINS
IN SCHOOL.

04:45.620 --> 04:46.412
AND YOU
AND MR. INGALLS

04:46.579 --> 04:48.247
ARE GOING
TO SPRINGFIELD.

04:48.414 --> 04:49.874
WELL,
I THOUGHT...

04:50.041 --> 04:53.252
WE THOUGHT WE COULD LEARN A LOT
MORE ABOUT TRAINS FIRSTHAND

04:53.419 --> 04:54.754
AND GET
EXTRA CREDIT.

04:54.921 --> 04:56.464
OH, NO,
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

04:56.631 --> 04:57.882
YOU'D MISS
TOO MUCH SCHOOL.

04:58.049 --> 05:00.635
BUT OUR PA'S
LETTING US GO.

05:02.595 --> 05:04.055
HE IS?

05:07.266 --> 05:10.478
OH, IS THAT-- IS THAT TRUE, MARY?
DID YOUR FATHER SAY THAT?

05:12.063 --> 05:13.815
YES, SIR,
HE DID.

05:13.982 --> 05:16.401
HE THOUGHT IT
WAS A FINE IDEA.

05:18.152 --> 05:19.362
OH, UH...

05:19.529 --> 05:20.905
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
GRACE?

05:21.072 --> 05:24.033
OH, IT'S UP TO YOU. I'M
NOT GONNA SAY A THING.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.702
WELL...

05:25.868 --> 05:28.454
ALL RIGHT, BUT MAKE SURE YOU'RE
CAUGHT UP ON YOUR CHORES.

05:29.580 --> 05:30.623
NOW, GET OUT OF HERE

05:30.790 --> 05:31.958

WANT ME TO DO?

09:56.222 --> 09:58.057
IT'S NOT SOMETHING
THAT I WANT.

TO LEARN A LESSON.

10:02.895 --> 10:05.189
I'LL, UM,

10:23.374 --> 10:25.084

CHANGE HIS MIND.

10:25.251 --> 10:26.669

AT FIRST.

10:26.836 --> 10:29.839
TILL MA GOT MAD.
THEN HE REALLY GOT MAD.

10:30.006 --> 10:31.424
HE WON'T CHANGE
HIS MIND.

10:31.590 --> 10:33.092

SORRY.
