YOUNG MAN:
Take off your shirt!

00:35.331 --> 00:37.415
Take it off, take it off!

00:48.124 --> 00:50.609
You want some wheel time, kiddo?

00:50.694 --> 00:52.411
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, come on.

00:52.495 --> 00:54.697
You said you wanted
to learn, right?

01:06.676 --> 01:09.011
Go, go, go!

01:13.066 --> 01:14.717
Oh my God.

01:14.738 --> 01:16.472
Get the kids below deck,
right now.

01:16.540 --> 01:17.840
Susan! Do it now!

01:24.814 --> 01:27.149
Everybody listen to me!

01:27.217 --> 01:29.318
We need to get below deck now!

01:39.095 --> 01:40.963
What are you looking at?

01:41.031 --> 01:43.132
Everybody to the back
of the boat! Let's go!

01:49.689 --> 01:51.190
Anybody else for a break?

01:51.274 --> 01:53.275
Let's go!

01:53.343 --> 01:55.611
Move it! Go!

All right,
right here.

02:32.234 --> 02:33.635
No, no, no.

02:33.702 --> 02:35.487
Shoulder's too thin, another
20 feet and we're good.

02:35.571 --> 02:37.238
Another 20 feet, I'm
gonna be in traction.

02:37.306 --> 02:38.907
What, you want to steer?

02:38.958 --> 02:40.742
Huh?

02:40.793 --> 02:42.744
Whoa, whoa.

02:44.580 --> 02:46.080
Do I want to steer?

02:46.132 --> 02:47.549
No. I don't want to steer.

02:47.616 --> 02:48.950
I want to continue to push

02:49.001 --> 02:53.588
this three-ton hunk of metal
up a hill in 95-degree weather!

02:53.656 --> 02:54.973
That's what I
want to do.

02:55.057 --> 02:56.508
No, I don't want to steer.
No.

02:56.592 --> 02:57.792
Yes, I'll steer,
thank you.

03:00.062 --> 03:02.397
Nine miles.

03:02.464 --> 03:04.065
Nine miles.

03:04.132 --> 03:05.767
Nine miles! You've
been working on

03:05.835 --> 03:06.935
your dad's old wreck
for six months,

03:06.986 --> 03:08.269
and you get nine miles
out of it.

03:08.320 --> 03:09.637
I'm very
impressed.

03:09.688 --> 03:11.272
This is a classic car, and
classic cars are temperamental.

03:11.340 --> 03:13.074
Temperamental?
Just like you.

03:13.141 --> 03:14.776
No, no, no.
That is an excuse.

03:14.844 --> 03:16.110
That is an excuse

03:16.178 --> 03:19.080
for poor automobile
maintenance, my friend.

03:19.147 --> 03:22.483
Okay? This is a car.
It is not "temperamental."

03:22.535 --> 03:25.119
it is a product! When it stops
working, you get another one.

03:25.187 --> 03:27.121
You understand?

03:27.173 --> 03:28.456
What happened to you, man?

03:28.524 --> 03:29.858
I mean, where's your
sentimental side?

03:29.925 --> 03:31.125
There's nothing
in there.

03:31.177 --> 03:32.594
I don't have a sentimental side.

03:32.661 --> 03:35.013
Okay? And if I did, it would
be reserved for human beings,

03:35.097 --> 03:36.264
not dopey
machines.

03:36.332 --> 03:37.599
Classic machines.

03:37.666 --> 03:39.000
Yeah, I know.
One person's classic

03:39.068 --> 03:40.335
is another person's
scrap metal.

03:40.402 --> 03:43.555
Well, thank you very much,
Socrates.

03:52.915 --> 03:53.982
You guys need some help?

03:54.033 --> 03:55.817
He needs help.
I just need a lift.

03:55.885 --> 03:57.452
Where do you need
to be dropped off?

03:57.519 --> 03:58.920
Coast Guard station.

04:03.692 --> 04:05.827
According to the tour operator,

04:05.895 --> 04:07.795
the boat left the dock
yesterday afternoon,

04:07.863 --> 04:11.666
with 12 college kids
and two crew on board,

04:11.717 --> 04:13.167
out of Waikiki.

04:13.219 --> 04:16.170
When it didn't return,
the Coast Guard

04:16.238 --> 04:18.473
set up a search grid
this morning.

04:18.540 --> 04:21.341
When they finally spotted
the vessel from the air,

04:21.410 --> 04:23.144
all the passengers
were gone,

04:23.211 --> 04:25.346
and they saw what looked
like two dead bodies

04:25.397 --> 04:26.814
up on the deck.

04:26.882 --> 04:29.384
Only two? What happened
to the other 12?

04:29.451 --> 04:32.220
Hey, there she is.

05:00.582 --> 05:03.017
♪
♪

05:13.629 --> 05:14.896
Steve.

05:14.964 --> 05:16.364
Yeah.

05:16.431 --> 05:17.699
Got three gunshot wounds,

05:17.766 --> 05:19.033
looks like could be
automatic weapons.

05:19.101 --> 05:21.452
Our second vic took
two to the chest.

05:29.878 --> 05:31.713
This guy looks local.
Could be Tongan.

05:31.780 --> 05:33.715
If he is, it could be
the work of Tongan pirates.

05:33.782 --> 05:36.250
They're all over the
crime bulletins lately

05:36.302 --> 05:38.119
for attacking charter boats
up and down the coast.

05:38.170 --> 05:39.453
Yeah, I read about that,

05:39.505 --> 05:41.723
but that's just random hits--
small boats, sailboats.

05:41.790 --> 05:43.658
I mean, just stick-ups.
Nobody was ever murdered.

05:43.692 --> 05:45.059
Yeah, or grabbed.

05:45.127 --> 05:47.478
Remember, we still got 12
passengers that are missing.

05:47.563 --> 05:50.398
But if you're right, these guys
have seriously upped their game.

05:50.465 --> 05:52.233
Check it out.
Captain was strapped.

05:52.300 --> 05:54.102
Well, with all
the attacks in the news,

05:54.153 --> 05:55.970
he'd be dumb not to be.
Right.

05:56.021 --> 05:57.839
With the bodies falling
in the position they did,

05:57.906 --> 05:58.973
it looks like a firefight.

05:59.024 --> 06:00.308
Captain was
defending the attack,

06:00.376 --> 06:02.310
took this guy down with him.
Steve. Check this out.

06:02.378 --> 06:03.444
What'd you get?

06:05.848 --> 06:06.981
The four gunmen.

06:07.032 --> 06:09.450
- And one boat.
- Okay, good.

06:09.501 --> 06:11.252
Stabilize that image
and then enhance it.

06:11.319 --> 06:13.705
See if we can't get a
better look at who did this.

06:13.789 --> 06:15.990
In the meantime, we need to
tow this boat to shore,

06:16.041 --> 06:18.459
let our crime techs
do a full sweep.

06:20.529 --> 06:22.663
Hey.

06:22.715 --> 06:23.998
Shh.

06:48.202 --> 06:50.532
Everything just
happened so fast.

06:51.508 --> 06:54.144
We're on the boat, and...
next thing you know,

06:54.149 --> 06:56.317
they're coming at us
out of nowhere.

06:56.385 --> 07:00.121
They were just
college kids on Spring Break.

07:00.188 --> 07:01.856
Please tell me they're not dead.

07:03.658 --> 07:08.212
How did you, uh, how'd you
manage to get away, Susan?

07:09.798 --> 07:12.867
Uh, they towed us
to another boat,

07:12.934 --> 07:15.519
and they forced
everyone onto it.

07:15.604 --> 07:18.606
One of the kids was hurt, so
he had to be carried on board.

07:18.673 --> 07:20.441
And when the gunmen
were busy doing that,

07:20.509 --> 07:23.511
I... slipped below deck.

07:25.814 --> 07:27.882
I feel so horrible
because I was trained

07:27.949 --> 07:32.086
to put the passenger first,
and...

07:32.154 --> 07:33.738
you know, I panicked.

07:33.822 --> 07:34.989
I was scared,

07:35.056 --> 07:36.424
I wasn't thinking.

07:36.491 --> 07:38.392
Listen, it's completely
normal to be scared

07:38.460 --> 07:40.745
in a situation
like that.

07:40.829 --> 07:42.129
Susan, the men that

07:42.197 --> 07:43.464
attacked the boat,
can you remember

07:43.531 --> 07:45.032
what type of
guns they had?

07:45.100 --> 07:46.550
Machine guns, I think.
Okay.

07:46.635 --> 07:48.636
I'm going to show you a couple
different types of guns,

07:48.703 --> 07:50.604
you tell me if any of these
are familiar, okay?

07:53.208 --> 07:54.308
That's it, there.

07:54.376 --> 07:55.509
That's it,
right there?

07:55.560 --> 07:57.144
Yeah.
AK-47.

07:57.212 --> 07:59.713
If there's anything else,
anything else at all

07:59.781 --> 08:01.982
that you could think of that'd
help us catch these guys...

08:02.050 --> 08:06.720
While I was hiding, I heard them
searching the galley.

08:06.772 --> 08:09.990
So... I cracked the door
a tiny bit,

08:10.058 --> 08:12.593
and I got a glimpse
of one of them.

08:13.779 --> 08:16.530
That the guy?

08:20.118 --> 08:22.937
The, the guy that I saw
was a Pacific Islander

08:23.004 --> 08:24.271
but he was thinner.

08:24.339 --> 08:26.340
Same skin tone...

08:26.407 --> 08:29.276
It's not a lot,
I know, I just...

08:29.344 --> 08:30.711
No. It's enough.
It's perfect.

08:30.779 --> 08:33.681
Susan, we'll find
these kids, okay?

08:33.748 --> 08:34.948
We'll find the kids.

08:38.102 --> 08:41.755
What we do know is this
island pleasure cruise

08:41.807 --> 08:43.390
apparently turned deadly.

08:43.457 --> 08:45.425
Watch your step.

08:45.477 --> 08:47.361
Chin Ho Kelly.

08:47.429 --> 08:49.430
Make sure none of these news
crews release any information

08:49.498 --> 08:50.898
that might compromise
this case, all right?

08:50.966 --> 08:52.533
Copy.
Hey, heads up.

08:52.600 --> 08:53.767
Heads up.
Susan!

08:53.819 --> 08:54.985
Whoa... whoa,
whoa, whoa!

08:55.070 --> 08:56.287
No, it's okay,
he's my fiancé.

08:59.107 --> 09:01.108
Thank God you're all right.

09:07.249 --> 09:09.416
Thank you.

09:15.473 --> 09:18.843
<i>I stabilized the cell phone</i>
<i>footage, but be prepared...</i>

09:18.927 --> 09:21.362
the quality's really bad.

09:21.429 --> 09:24.431
I only have a few good frames
showing two of the attackers,

09:24.482 --> 09:25.482
and both of them
are wearing ski masks.

09:25.567 --> 09:27.651
But I'm accumulating
biometric data,

09:27.736 --> 09:29.537
so we can run comparisons
when a suspect turns up.

09:29.604 --> 09:31.689
Nice.

09:31.773 --> 09:33.741
So the HPD pulled the passenger
manifest from the tour operator,

09:33.808 --> 09:34.975
ran their names--
all of them

09:35.043 --> 09:36.660
from the mainland,
East Coast, college age.

09:36.745 --> 09:39.346
Now, some of them went to the
same school and flew in together

09:39.414 --> 09:40.865
but there's
no rap sheets,

09:40.949 --> 09:42.616
no sealed juvie records,

09:42.667 --> 09:44.201
nothing to show that this
wasn't a random attack.

09:44.286 --> 09:46.170
All right... I just got off
the phone with the FBI.

09:46.254 --> 09:48.672
Good news is:
kids are still alive.

09:48.757 --> 09:50.541
Bad news is:
they have been kidnapped.

09:50.625 --> 09:51.825
All right, two hours ago,

09:51.877 --> 09:53.060
the parents started
receiving ransom demands,

09:53.128 --> 09:54.328
the FBI was called,

09:54.396 --> 09:56.163
but the Governor--smooth--
put the brakes on that.

09:56.231 --> 09:57.548
She wants us running
with the case

09:57.632 --> 09:59.066
because we are the ones
who caught it.

09:59.134 --> 10:01.302
Good.
Okay, what about this ransom?

10:01.353 --> 10:02.836
$20 million.

10:02.904 --> 10:05.389
Yeah. Each of the parents
received a call

10:05.473 --> 10:07.241
on their cell phone.
Same exact call.

10:07.309 --> 10:08.976
And, unlike having
lunch with you,

10:09.027 --> 10:11.979
they don't care how the check is
split, they just want the money.

10:12.030 --> 10:13.914
20 mill-- someone knew these
kids' parents had money.

10:13.982 --> 10:16.200
Yeah, uh, it's highly likely
these guys were targeted.

10:16.284 --> 10:18.285
Or our pirates got lucky.
They realized what they had,

10:18.353 --> 10:19.920
and decided to go
for the crazy money.

10:19.988 --> 10:21.322
All right. I want to
talk to the parents.

10:21.389 --> 10:23.123
Well, the first couple just
landed-- they got the call

10:23.191 --> 10:25.492
on the West Coast. The other
ones are still up in the air.

10:25.543 --> 10:27.227
Fine. Have HPD bring them in.

10:27.295 --> 10:28.879
In the meantime,
we'll set up

10:28.964 --> 10:30.497
a holding area at the Hilton
for the other families.

10:30.565 --> 10:32.366
We'll make sure there's grief
counselors standing by, okay?

10:32.434 --> 10:34.635
These people are going to land,
they're going to have questions.

10:34.702 --> 10:36.136
Let's get some answers.

10:37.906 --> 10:40.140
DISTORTED VOICE
Listen to me very carefully.

10:40.208 --> 10:42.142
If you want to see
your kid alive again,

10:42.210 --> 10:43.844
you'll do exactly what we ask.

10:43.912 --> 10:45.412
MR. LAYTON:
How do I know you
have my daughter?

10:45.480 --> 10:47.014
How do I know she's alive?

10:47.065 --> 10:48.182
JOSIE
Daddy?

10:48.249 --> 10:49.516
Josie!

10:49.584 --> 10:50.985
Daddy, I'm so scared.

10:51.052 --> 10:52.853
MR. LAYTON: Baby, it's gonna be
okay, I promise.

10:52.921 --> 10:54.288
DISTORTED VOICE:
There's your proof of life.

10:54.356 --> 10:57.557
Now get the money, or we'll
send you proof of death.

10:57.609 --> 11:00.227
Please.
She's our little girl.

11:00.295 --> 11:03.063
You have to find her.

11:05.333 --> 11:06.967
I will.

11:08.119 --> 11:09.536
I will.

11:18.213 --> 11:19.913
What you doing, bud?

11:19.981 --> 11:21.915
Huh?
What are you doing there?

11:21.983 --> 11:23.884
I'm buying a car. What does it
look like I'm doing?

11:23.952 --> 11:25.719
It looks like you're doing
Downward Dog, but I know

11:25.770 --> 11:26.887
you don't do yoga, so...
That's funny.

11:26.955 --> 11:28.389
No, I am stretching
because my back hurts.

11:28.440 --> 11:29.690
Do you know why my back hurts?

11:29.758 --> 11:31.025
No, I don't know.
Why does your back hurt?

11:31.092 --> 11:32.693
I'll tell you why--
it's because I spent

11:32.761 --> 11:35.029
the morning pushing a car
down the Pali Highway.

11:35.096 --> 11:37.898
Oh. Oh, where I come from,
that's called good exercise.

11:37.966 --> 11:39.199
Oh, really?
Where is that, Krypton?

11:39.267 --> 11:40.617
'Cause where I come from,
that's called

11:40.702 --> 11:41.969
a worker's comp settlement.

11:42.037 --> 11:43.070
Hey.

11:43.138 --> 11:45.072
Big guy, over here, man.
Oh, my God.

11:45.123 --> 11:46.974
Hey, check him out.

11:48.977 --> 11:50.444
You're wearing a plastic bag.

11:50.495 --> 11:52.112
Whew!

11:52.163 --> 11:54.298
You, uh, need some
oxygen, babe?

11:54.382 --> 11:55.466
I'm good.

11:55.550 --> 11:56.550
No, you don't
look good.

11:56.617 --> 11:57.985
You look like you
might be dying.

11:58.053 --> 11:59.319
It's true. You don't look good.

12:00.822 --> 12:02.556
I'm good.
How'd you guys find me?

12:02.624 --> 12:03.557
We went by your shop.

12:03.625 --> 12:04.725
They told us you
were out here.

12:04.793 --> 12:06.093
They're fired.

12:06.144 --> 12:08.562
When did you start,
uh, jogging?

12:08.629 --> 12:10.564
I'm in training, brah.

12:10.631 --> 12:12.099
Did he just say he's
in a training bra?

12:12.150 --> 12:13.484
No, he...
Very funny.

12:13.568 --> 12:15.152
I'm training
for a sumo competition.

12:15.236 --> 12:16.636
Oh. Sumo.

12:16.688 --> 12:17.938
Sumo.

12:18.006 --> 12:19.273
Shouldn't you be, uh,
wearing a diaper?

12:19.324 --> 12:20.507
Big diaper?
Something like that?

12:20.575 --> 12:21.842
It's called a <i>mawashi,</i> brah.

12:21.910 --> 12:23.711
Lip off to me one more time.

12:23.778 --> 12:26.914
I'll give you a personal introduction to the sport.
I like my odds. Bring it.

12:26.981 --> 12:28.248
Hey, look, guys, we don't
have time for this.

12:28.316 --> 12:29.383
All right? Come on.

12:30.418 --> 12:31.985
I assume you guys need help.

12:32.053 --> 12:33.504
Yes, we do.
What do you know

12:33.588 --> 12:34.988
about these local pirates
jacking tourists?

12:35.056 --> 12:36.824
Only what I read in the papers.

12:36.891 --> 12:39.626
Bunch of Tongan bruddahs
taking down lightweight scores.

12:39.694 --> 12:42.129
Nothing serious. Yeah, well, they
just graduated to heavyweight.

12:42.197 --> 12:44.515
They're now kidnapping
and murdering people.

12:44.599 --> 12:46.800
12 kids from the mainland
missing just like that.

12:46.868 --> 12:48.001
Now their parents
are getting hit up

12:48.069 --> 12:49.053
for an eight-figure payday.

12:49.137 --> 12:50.304
Which means
we're after a crew

12:50.371 --> 12:52.773
that don't play
by the rules.

12:52.841 --> 12:54.842
Okay, what-what's...
why the mysterious looks?

12:54.909 --> 12:56.360
What's going...
what do you know?

12:56.444 --> 13:01.248
Couple years ago,
there was a kidnapping.

13:01.316 --> 13:05.652
Young... young couple from
Dubai tied in to big money.

13:05.720 --> 13:07.855
Something went wrong
at the drop.

13:07.922 --> 13:08.889
Couple was killed.

13:08.957 --> 13:10.124
I didn't believe it
then, but...

13:10.191 --> 13:11.525
word on the street was...

13:11.593 --> 13:13.710
it was a rogue Tongan gang
that did the job.

13:16.064 --> 13:17.998
You think there's
any connection?

13:18.049 --> 13:19.166
You tell us.

13:21.136 --> 13:23.253
I'll make some calls.

13:26.591 --> 13:28.208
Kono.
Yeah.

13:28.259 --> 13:30.043
You good at puzzles?

13:30.095 --> 13:31.311
Well, what do you got?

13:31.379 --> 13:33.714
Max just sent over
his autopsy results.

13:33.782 --> 13:36.383
Both of these vics were killed
by gunshot wounds to the chest,

13:36.451 --> 13:38.852
but their times of death
were a day apart.

13:38.920 --> 13:40.220
Excuse me?

13:40.288 --> 13:42.689
All right, let me get this
straight, so I understand.

13:42.740 --> 13:44.274
Our-our victims were killed
at different times?

13:44.359 --> 13:45.626
Yeah, 24 hours apart.

13:45.693 --> 13:48.579
Okay, so...
so that means that either Max

13:48.663 --> 13:52.933
is dead wrong, or we are dealing
with a Tongan pirate zombie.

13:53.001 --> 13:54.468
It's possible.
No, it's not possible.

13:54.536 --> 13:56.286
I was kidding. No, listen.
What I'm saying is,

13:56.371 --> 13:58.305
if our Tongan pirate
was killed a full day earlier,

13:58.373 --> 13:59.907
he could have been dumped
on the boat.

13:59.974 --> 14:01.608
And ballistics confirm
that both vics

14:01.676 --> 14:03.277
were killed by the same gun.

14:03.311 --> 14:05.279
Slugs were 7.62 caliber.

14:05.346 --> 14:07.414
AK-47s use 7.62's.

14:07.465 --> 14:09.099
All right, so this means
that our Tongan victim

14:09.184 --> 14:11.885
could have been killed
by his own people, right?

14:11.953 --> 14:13.086
Unless somebody dumped the body

14:13.154 --> 14:14.788
at the scene of the kidnapping
to frame them.

14:14.856 --> 14:16.273
Okay, good!

14:16.357 --> 14:18.108
So our suspect pool
has now expanded

14:18.193 --> 14:20.594
to anybody who has beef
with the Tongans. Yeah.

14:20.662 --> 14:22.262
Oh, that could be half
the island, brah.

14:22.313 --> 14:23.697
Thank you.
Okay.

14:23.764 --> 14:25.315
Hey, that was Kamekona.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.818
He's got a lead--
guy named Big Lono.

14:27.902 --> 14:29.453
He owns a pawn
shop in Kalihi.

14:29.537 --> 14:30.954
Uh, place is being used to move

14:31.039 --> 14:32.206
the pirate''
stolen merch,

14:32.273 --> 14:34.458
so if anybody knows where
to find these guys,

14:34.542 --> 14:36.610
it's going to
be Big Lono.

14:41.416 --> 14:43.684
<i>I don't know where you got</i>
<i>your information from,</i>

14:43.751 --> 14:46.119
but you're wrong.
Okay. Lono...

14:46.187 --> 14:47.487
understand, please.
It's not about you.

14:47.555 --> 14:48.755
This is about 12 missing kids

14:48.806 --> 14:50.257
and finding the men
that kidnapped them.

14:50.325 --> 14:51.658
I don't know
nothing about that.

14:51.726 --> 14:53.193
I run an honest
business here.

14:53.261 --> 14:54.845
It's an honest business.
Okay.

14:54.929 --> 14:56.997
So, if it's an honest business,
then, please,

14:57.065 --> 14:58.999
just open this door, huh?

14:59.067 --> 15:00.851
And so long as we don't find
any stolen merchandise,

15:00.935 --> 15:02.970
then we will know
that you are not doing business

15:03.037 --> 15:06.139
with, uh... the pirates,
and, uh, we'll be on our way.

15:06.207 --> 15:08.208
Forget it.

15:10.011 --> 15:12.613
You see that door?
That's built to withstand

15:12.680 --> 15:14.948
a 300-pound Samoan
meth addict.

15:14.999 --> 15:18.051
So back off before you
break a nail, sunshine.

15:18.119 --> 15:19.987
Huh. That's good.
How about you open it

15:20.054 --> 15:21.955
or I'll come over there
and I'll break your face?

15:22.023 --> 15:23.390
You got some kind
of learning disability?

15:23.458 --> 15:24.691
Read my lips.

15:24.759 --> 15:25.959
You, me--

15:26.027 --> 15:27.361
we're done talking.

15:27.428 --> 15:29.062
Is that right?
Look, you seem to be

15:29.130 --> 15:30.631
the more rational
of the two.

15:30.698 --> 15:33.166
He...? LONO: So
I'll say this one more time.

15:33.234 --> 15:35.602
I can't help you.
I'm sorry.

15:37.472 --> 15:39.306
You have five seconds
to open the door.

15:39.374 --> 15:40.641
Or what?
One.

15:40.708 --> 15:41.909
What you going to do?
Two.

15:41.976 --> 15:43.043
My cousin's a lawyer,

15:43.111 --> 15:44.578
so I know my rights.
Three.

15:44.646 --> 15:46.396
Four.
And you can't come in here

15:46.481 --> 15:47.514
without a warrant.

15:47.582 --> 15:49.383
Five.
Time's up.

15:49.450 --> 15:50.817
You going to open the door?

15:50.885 --> 15:52.152
Not a chance.
Okay.

15:52.220 --> 15:53.921
I'll be back.

15:53.988 --> 15:55.722
"I'll be back"?!

15:55.790 --> 15:57.758
That... he's done
a lot better. Trust me.

15:57.825 --> 15:59.393
That's all you can come up with,
is "I'll be back?"

15:59.460 --> 16:01.695
I got something.
I got something good.

16:01.763 --> 16:04.197
What are you going to do, drive
the car through the, uh...?

16:04.249 --> 16:05.565
Hey! I got the keys.

16:05.633 --> 16:07.784
<i>¿Quieres llaves?</i>

16:10.722 --> 16:11.939
You see what you did?

16:12.006 --> 16:13.590
I don't know what
he's going to do,

16:13.675 --> 16:15.776
but if I were you, I'd run--
out the back,

16:15.843 --> 16:17.544
side, roof-- go.

16:17.612 --> 16:19.513
A grenade. He has a grenade.

16:19.564 --> 16:21.081
Why do you have a grenade?
He's got a grenade.

16:21.149 --> 16:22.549
You see this?
You see this?

16:22.600 --> 16:24.084
He's not bluffing.
He will pull the pin

16:24.152 --> 16:25.352
and blow everybody up.

16:25.403 --> 16:26.920
So will you
trust me, please?

16:26.988 --> 16:28.088
That thing's not even real.

16:28.156 --> 16:29.723
Are you going to
open the door?

16:29.774 --> 16:31.091
Not a chance.

16:31.159 --> 16:33.076
Okay.

16:35.113 --> 16:36.430
You sure?

16:38.433 --> 16:40.033
Okay.

16:40.084 --> 16:42.786
You're not bl...
you're not bluffing. Go. Go.

16:44.939 --> 16:46.306
Move.
That's so sick.

16:54.048 --> 16:55.449
Come on!

16:55.516 --> 16:57.117
What is the matter with you?

16:57.185 --> 16:58.251
You need help.

16:58.319 --> 17:00.053
I will pay for it.

17:05.443 --> 17:08.028
Why?

17:11.531 --> 17:13.400
Let me see your hands.

17:13.468 --> 17:15.902
What'd I tell you?

17:15.970 --> 17:17.170
You see how that worked?

17:18.673 --> 17:20.272
This could have
been avoided.

17:23.294 --> 17:25.278
Lono, you remember...

17:25.346 --> 17:26.813
all that hot stuff

17:26.881 --> 17:28.849
that you said
you did not have,

17:28.916 --> 17:30.484
that you assured me
that the pirates

17:30.551 --> 17:32.686
did not give to you to sell?

17:32.754 --> 17:34.921
This--

17:34.989 --> 17:37.190
this gold money clip--
it's on a police report

17:37.258 --> 17:39.459
of items stolen
by the Tongan pirates.

17:39.510 --> 17:42.095
Now, how do you
explain that? You can't.

17:42.163 --> 17:43.397
Where do we find these guys?

17:57.078 --> 17:58.445
Hands! Hands!

17:58.496 --> 17:59.713
Let me see your hands!

17:59.781 --> 18:00.947
Let's go!
Secure.

18:01.015 --> 18:02.982
Clear. Secure.
Put your hands up!

18:03.034 --> 18:04.201
Hey, brah, you can't
go in there!

18:04.285 --> 18:05.535
Hey, you, shut up.

18:17.065 --> 18:18.298
Hey, place is clear.

18:18.349 --> 18:19.699
There's no sign of hostages.

18:22.720 --> 18:24.838
Then where the hell are they?

18:57.024 --> 18:58.416
Make sure you get a close-up
on the eyes, Scotty.

18:58.650 --> 19:01.885
I need it for a biometric
comparison test.

19:19.313 --> 19:20.047
Saloni,

19:20.113 --> 19:21.413
you kidnapped a
couple of kids

19:21.481 --> 19:23.482
off Waikiki yesterday.
Where are they?

19:23.550 --> 19:26.251
Don't know what
you're talking about, brah.

19:26.319 --> 19:28.020
Where are you holding them?

19:30.490 --> 19:31.990
How about this guy?

19:32.058 --> 19:33.792
You ever seen him? Huh?

19:40.150 --> 19:41.733
His name is Vai Keoni.

19:41.801 --> 19:43.068
He's my cousin.

19:43.119 --> 19:44.269
Who-who killed him?

19:44.337 --> 19:45.604
Why don't
you tell us?

19:46.973 --> 19:50.442
If I knew,
that guy would be dead.

19:55.448 --> 19:57.132
Okay.

19:57.217 --> 19:58.884
You want the truth, McGarrett?

20:00.587 --> 20:02.588
I rob people.

20:02.639 --> 20:04.690
People who can afford
to take the loss.

20:04.757 --> 20:08.143
Rich tourists who have
no respect for these islands.

20:08.228 --> 20:11.497
I rip them off, but...
I don't hurt them.

20:11.564 --> 20:13.265
These questions
you're asking me,

20:13.333 --> 20:14.967
I can't answer.

20:15.034 --> 20:16.702
I didn't kill
my own cousin,

20:16.769 --> 20:17.936
and I sure didn't
kidnap any

20:18.004 --> 20:19.388
of these kids you're talking about.
Fine.

20:19.455 --> 20:21.807
When was the last time you saw Vai?
Couple of days ago.

20:21.875 --> 20:23.742
He said he got a call
from some folks in town.

20:23.810 --> 20:25.327
They said they had
a little work for him.

20:25.411 --> 20:27.279
What kind of work?
Didn't ask.

20:27.330 --> 20:28.280
Who hired him?

20:28.348 --> 20:29.581
Didn't ask.

20:29.649 --> 20:31.316
That's just the way it goes.

20:31.384 --> 20:32.451
Oh, so...

20:32.502 --> 20:34.086
you pirates have, um...

20:34.153 --> 20:36.655
like, a piratey code
of silence thing?

20:36.723 --> 20:38.173
Hoo-ya.

20:39.048 --> 20:39.997
How about this?

20:40.065 --> 20:40.998
Two people are dead.

20:41.050 --> 20:42.233
12 kids missing.

20:42.301 --> 20:43.868
And I don't care
if you did it or not--

20:43.919 --> 20:45.303
I'm going to make sure
you go to prison

20:45.370 --> 20:47.371
and you stay there for the rest
of your life. How about that?

20:47.439 --> 20:48.840
Take off my watch.

20:48.907 --> 20:50.341
What?

20:50.409 --> 20:52.176
Take off my watch.

20:52.244 --> 20:54.212
Go ahead, take it off.
All right. Okay.

20:57.683 --> 20:59.217
My boys and I
took it off

20:59.284 --> 21:00.435
a deep-sea fishing charter

21:00.519 --> 21:02.353
off the coast of Molokai
yesterday afternoon.

21:02.421 --> 21:03.955
There is no way

21:04.022 --> 21:06.224
we can get from there to Waikiki

21:06.291 --> 21:07.558
to kidnap these kids
you're talking...

21:07.609 --> 21:08.693
How do we know that you...

21:08.761 --> 21:10.895
It's engraved, "To my
loving husband, Bert."

21:10.946 --> 21:13.131
Portly fellow,
Boston accent,

21:13.198 --> 21:14.866
weak bladder.

21:14.917 --> 21:17.235
You think this
is funny? Huh?

21:17.302 --> 21:18.586
I'm asking-- you
think it's funny

21:18.670 --> 21:20.070
to put guns in
people's faces?

21:20.122 --> 21:23.207
Look, I'm sure Bert filled out
a police report by now.

21:23.275 --> 21:25.576
Go ahead and check it out,
'cause like I said,

21:25.644 --> 21:27.912
I rob people, McGarrett;
I don't hurt them.

21:27.980 --> 21:30.181
I'm Mr. Aloha,
and I'm not going to go down

21:30.249 --> 21:32.316
for something
that I didn't do, my bruddah.

21:35.220 --> 21:36.521
No matches.

21:36.588 --> 21:38.689
Great, so none
of the guys we busted

21:38.757 --> 21:40.224
attacked that boat
yesterday.

21:40.275 --> 21:42.226
Unless maybe the guys
we caught on the video footage

21:42.294 --> 21:43.778
weren't in the house
when we hit it.

21:43.862 --> 21:46.397
Or maybe it confirms my theory
that this is a frame job.

21:46.448 --> 21:48.099
That is the second
time you said that.

21:48.167 --> 21:49.400
All right, you
really think

21:49.468 --> 21:50.902
someone cloned the
pirates' M.O.?

21:50.953 --> 21:52.436
Look, everything
the kidnappers needed to know

21:52.504 --> 21:54.622
was in the eyewitness report
printed in the newspaper.

21:54.706 --> 21:57.475
All they had to do was copy what
the real pirates did and send us

21:57.543 --> 21:58.843
on a wild goose chase.

21:58.911 --> 22:01.162
And they left us a body to
lead us to Saloni and his crew.

22:01.246 --> 22:02.463
If you are right,

22:02.548 --> 22:04.115
it means whoever
grabbed these kids

22:04.183 --> 22:05.950
are a lot smarter
than we thought.

22:06.001 --> 22:07.852
Not smart enough apparently,
because we figured them out.

22:25.237 --> 22:27.738
Okay, these are them.

22:33.712 --> 22:34.779
Hey, Steve.

22:34.830 --> 22:36.581
Yeah, the parents
are here.

22:43.839 --> 22:45.456
Any word? Anything?
Please?

22:45.507 --> 22:47.324
Ladies and gentlemen,

22:47.376 --> 22:49.160
we'll answer all your questions,
I promise.

22:49.228 --> 22:50.845
My name is
Lieutenant Commander

22:50.929 --> 22:51.846
Steve McGarrett.

22:51.930 --> 22:53.464
I run the Five-0
task force

22:53.532 --> 22:54.966
for the state
of Hawaii.

22:55.033 --> 22:56.500
And along with
the Honolulu Police Department,

22:56.568 --> 22:58.469
I want to assure you
that we are doing

22:58.537 --> 23:00.905
absolutely everything possible
to find your children.

23:00.973 --> 23:03.040
We're hearing that you have
some people in custody.

23:03.108 --> 23:04.342
Is that true?

23:04.409 --> 23:06.527
We do have some suspects
in custody right now.

23:06.612 --> 23:07.578
If they're in custody,

23:07.646 --> 23:08.779
then where are our children?

23:08.847 --> 23:10.198
At this point,
we have no evidence

23:10.282 --> 23:11.449
linking these men
to what happened.

23:11.516 --> 23:12.450
It's been two days

23:12.517 --> 23:14.018
since it happened.
I know.

23:14.069 --> 23:15.119
They're just kids.

23:15.187 --> 23:17.855
Who knows what these people
are doing to them.

23:17.923 --> 23:19.490
Look, if you don't know
where they are,

23:19.558 --> 23:21.358
why don't you just
let us pay the ransom

23:21.410 --> 23:22.743
and we can bring
our kids home.

23:22.828 --> 23:25.630
That would be a bad idea,
sir, Mr...

23:25.697 --> 23:26.631
Brown.
Mr. Brown.

23:26.698 --> 23:27.632
Morris Brown.

23:27.699 --> 23:31.636
And this is my son... Justin.

23:35.507 --> 23:36.974
Mr. Brown, all of you,

23:37.042 --> 23:39.710
what's very important right now
is that you're patient

23:39.778 --> 23:40.745
in a situation
like this.

23:40.812 --> 23:41.979
We will find
your kids.

23:42.047 --> 23:44.982
But you must understand
that nothing positive

23:45.050 --> 23:47.818
will be gained by paying
this ransom, okay?

23:47.886 --> 23:50.655
I've handled many
kidnapping cases personally.

23:50.722 --> 23:52.723
And one misstep
from any one of us,

23:52.791 --> 23:54.258
this can end very, very badly.

23:54.326 --> 23:55.559
I think you're wrong.
You're wrong.

23:55.611 --> 23:57.728
This is just a piece
of business for these guys.

23:57.779 --> 23:59.130
They're just in it
for the money.

23:59.197 --> 24:00.748
And if that's what brings
our kids back,

24:00.832 --> 24:01.966
I say let them have it.

24:02.034 --> 24:04.268
What I need you all
to do right now...

24:04.336 --> 24:06.504
is to trust us.

24:06.571 --> 24:07.838
Just like all of you,

24:07.906 --> 24:10.308
I've been on the other end
of that call.

24:10.375 --> 24:13.094
And believe me, I understand,
it is the worst feeling,

24:13.178 --> 24:16.580
it's-it's the worst feeling
in the world.

24:16.682 --> 24:19.116
But right now, you need
to be strong, okay?

24:19.184 --> 24:22.286
You need to be
strong for your kids,

24:22.354 --> 24:24.255
and you need to let us
handle this.

24:24.323 --> 24:25.890
As soon as we know
something significant,

24:25.941 --> 24:27.458
you will be the first to hear.

24:27.526 --> 24:28.960
You have my word.

24:29.027 --> 24:30.861
So what you're really saying is
y-you don't know anything.

24:39.104 --> 24:42.573
What are the real chances of
getting these kids back alive?

24:44.609 --> 24:46.944
When my father was kidnapped,
I knew from prior experience

24:46.995 --> 24:48.963
that no matter what move
I made on that day,

24:49.047 --> 24:50.381
the results were not
gonna be good.

24:50.448 --> 24:51.799
Okay? I mean,
these situations,

24:51.883 --> 24:54.168
they rarely are.

24:54.252 --> 24:56.671
We're gonna change that.

24:56.755 --> 24:58.339
We're gonna get these kids back.

24:58.423 --> 25:00.257
We're gonna get them
back alive.

25:05.092 --> 25:06.942
<i>Turns out,</i>
<i>Saloni's alibi checks out.</i>

25:07.027 --> 25:09.111
That watch he had
was taken two days ago

25:09.196 --> 25:10.896
from a tourist
on a fishing charter.

25:10.947 --> 25:12.148
Description matches
Saloni and his men.

25:12.232 --> 25:14.300
Oh, look at that, a crook
who tells the truth.

25:14.368 --> 25:15.401
Yeah, really.

25:15.452 --> 25:16.535
What you got?

25:16.603 --> 25:17.803
All right, so I ran
a system check

25:17.871 --> 25:19.372
on the kidnapped kids since
they arrived on the Island.

25:19.439 --> 25:21.674
Credit card charges, phone
calls, that sort of thing.

25:21.742 --> 25:22.958
Mm-hmm.
Couple things stood out.

25:23.043 --> 25:25.628
One, none of them showed
any sort of payment

25:25.712 --> 25:26.879
for the actual cruise.

25:26.947 --> 25:29.048
Well, unless each of them
paid in cash, right?

25:29.115 --> 25:31.450
According to the tour operator,
all 12 tickets were purchased

25:31.518 --> 25:33.652
by one person,
and he paid in cash.

25:33.720 --> 25:35.788
One person. Was it
one of the kids?

25:35.839 --> 25:37.173
No. The tour operator said
he was older.

25:37.257 --> 25:39.058
Hat, sunglasses--
didn't give us much to go on.

25:39.125 --> 25:41.227
Also found another thing

25:41.294 --> 25:43.462
interesting in the kids'
credit card charges.

25:43.530 --> 25:45.481
So some of them stayed
at different hotels

25:45.565 --> 25:46.565
and ate at
different restaurants.

25:46.633 --> 25:48.234
The one thing
they all had in common

25:48.301 --> 25:50.903
was that they had a bar
tab at a club called STORM

25:50.971 --> 25:52.738
the afternoon before
the kidnapping.

25:52.806 --> 25:54.306
According to
the credit card companies,

25:54.357 --> 25:55.975
they also spent
some money there today.

25:56.042 --> 25:57.976
All right.

25:58.028 --> 26:00.079
That means that whoever made
those charges

26:00.146 --> 26:01.280
stole their credit cards.

26:01.331 --> 26:03.048
And can help lead us
to the kidnapped kids.

26:24.554 --> 26:25.504
Four-year college tuition:

26:25.555 --> 26:27.139
$200,000.

26:27.190 --> 26:29.442
Books and
5,000.

26:29.509 --> 26:30.893
Room and
25,000.

26:30.977 --> 26:32.044
Passing out with

26:32.112 --> 26:33.345
two cocktail olives
up your nose...

26:33.396 --> 26:34.780
Priceless.

26:37.250 --> 26:40.753
Hey. I'm sorry, but, uh,
I'm gonna have to I.D. you.

26:40.821 --> 26:42.588
Yeah, no problem.

26:42.656 --> 26:43.722
Oh, you're good, partner.

26:46.076 --> 26:47.026
What's your name?

26:47.093 --> 26:48.527
Moku.
Anyone else work

26:48.578 --> 26:50.546
at the bar with you today, Moku?
Just Bobby and me.

27:16.623 --> 27:18.691
That's a good trick.

27:18.758 --> 27:21.110
I don't know
anything about

27:21.194 --> 27:23.028
any missing kids.

27:23.079 --> 27:24.163
Why'd you run?

27:25.632 --> 27:28.617
You served these kids drinks
two days ago, didn't you?

27:28.702 --> 27:31.036
Let me guess.

27:31.087 --> 27:32.738
You kept an imprint
of the credit cards,

27:32.806 --> 27:34.874
ran some charges today
and kept the cash.

27:34.925 --> 27:36.959
Listen to me
real carefully, Bobby.

27:37.043 --> 27:38.811
Credit card fraud
is six months probation,

27:38.879 --> 27:40.546
kidnapping is life;
you do the math.

27:40.597 --> 27:41.814
You got to believe me,

27:41.882 --> 27:44.350
I had nothing to do
with kidnapping those kids.

27:54.144 --> 27:55.194
Kono.

27:55.261 --> 27:56.612
Yeah. You got something?

27:56.696 --> 27:57.796
Moku thinks
he remembers

27:57.864 --> 27:59.648
something from the day
the kids were here.

27:59.733 --> 28:01.934
I-I don't know, maybe.

28:01.985 --> 28:04.069
There was this guy,
a little bit older than

28:04.120 --> 28:05.404
the rest of the crowd.

28:05.472 --> 28:07.656
I remember him because
he snuck into the VIP section,

28:07.741 --> 28:08.741
said he had some

28:08.808 --> 28:10.659
promotional thing.
Security ended up

28:10.744 --> 28:12.177
kicking him out,
but other than that,

28:12.245 --> 28:13.245
it was just your ordinary

28:13.296 --> 28:14.847
out of control
spring break party.

28:14.915 --> 28:15.948
Those work?

28:16.016 --> 28:18.083
Yeah, boss put them in
last year

28:18.134 --> 28:19.451
to make sure we
carded everyone.

28:19.502 --> 28:20.669
You didn't card my cousin.

28:20.754 --> 28:22.471
Yeah, man, about that...

28:22.556 --> 28:24.423
Yeah, yeah, yeah. At least
you didn't call me her father.

28:24.474 --> 28:26.475
Hey, Moku,
we're gonna need to see

28:26.560 --> 28:28.794
the security tapes from two days ago.
Sure thing.

28:28.862 --> 28:31.647
<i>I think we found</i>
<i>one of our kidnappers.</i>

28:33.633 --> 28:36.569
So, here we have our
kidnapped kids, all 12 of them,

28:36.636 --> 28:38.604
dancing, buying drinks,
having fun.

28:38.655 --> 28:40.706
Then there's this guy.

28:44.361 --> 28:46.845
Perfect match.

28:46.913 --> 28:49.281
We ran his face through
the system, didn't get any hits.

28:49.332 --> 28:50.482
What's he doing at the club?

28:50.550 --> 28:52.067
Uh, well, at first,

28:52.135 --> 28:54.486
he's just at the bar
watching the kids.

28:54.554 --> 28:56.956
And then we have him
approaching them

28:57.023 --> 29:00.025
in the VIP section.

29:00.093 --> 29:01.176
What's he giving them?

29:01.261 --> 29:04.346
Passes to the catamaran cruise.

29:04.431 --> 29:06.799
We sent his picture over
to the tour operator; he thinks

29:06.866 --> 29:08.183
this is the guy
that bought

29:08.268 --> 29:09.351
all 12 tickets in cash.

29:09.436 --> 29:10.386
He targeted these kids.
He put them

29:10.470 --> 29:11.403
on that boat to be kidnapped.

29:11.471 --> 29:14.056
It's a smart play, actually.

29:14.140 --> 29:16.742
If you're a kid behind the
velvet ropes of the VIP section,

29:16.810 --> 29:18.877
chances are,
you got a mommy or daddy

29:18.945 --> 29:21.313
who can, uh, afford
to pay a big fat ransom.

29:23.066 --> 29:24.400
It's McGarrett.

29:24.484 --> 29:26.051
Steve, this is Sergeant Lukela.

29:26.119 --> 29:28.721
Someone just called into HPD
asking to talk to

29:28.788 --> 29:30.189
the person running
the investigation.

29:30.256 --> 29:31.657
We got him on hold.

29:31.725 --> 29:32.758
Okay, patch them through.

29:32.826 --> 29:33.759
Run a trace.

29:33.827 --> 29:35.260
Patching through now.

29:38.465 --> 29:40.199
DISTORTED VOICE:
Who is this?

29:40.266 --> 29:41.934
Lieutenant Commander
Steve McGarrett.

29:42.002 --> 29:44.436
What kind of game do you think
you're playing, cop?

29:44.504 --> 29:46.922
I don't know
what you're talking about.

29:47.007 --> 29:48.841
I'm talking about the money.

29:48.892 --> 29:51.060
You think I didn't know these
parents would go to the cops?

29:51.144 --> 29:52.244
I expected that.

29:52.312 --> 29:53.746
What I did not expect

29:53.813 --> 29:56.115
is for you to be playing
with their kids' lives.

29:56.182 --> 29:57.416
Now where's the rest?

29:57.484 --> 30:00.586
Okay, hang on--
We-We haven't paid any money.

30:00.654 --> 30:03.355
We gave very simple
instructions, and you blew it.

30:03.406 --> 30:04.907
You had to test us, didn't you?

30:04.991 --> 30:06.191
Listen to me, all right?

30:06.259 --> 30:07.693
I don't know
what you're talking...

30:07.761 --> 30:08.794
Enough!

30:08.862 --> 30:09.795
Enough games.

30:09.863 --> 30:10.946
All right, listen, calm down.

30:11.031 --> 30:11.947
Okay, calm down,

30:12.032 --> 30:13.565
let's talk about this.

30:13.633 --> 30:15.768
Killing people is not gonna get
you that money, you understand?

30:15.835 --> 30:18.470
Oh, it's too late for that.

30:18.538 --> 30:20.639
What are you talking about?

30:20.707 --> 30:21.807
What'd you do?

30:21.875 --> 30:23.742
Hey, what did you--

30:23.810 --> 30:25.044
What the hell have you done?

30:25.111 --> 30:26.478
I'm gonna
call you again directly

30:26.546 --> 30:27.913
in one hour,
with new instructions.

30:27.981 --> 30:31.083
I suggest you follow them
exactly this time.

30:31.134 --> 30:33.252
Did you get that?
Got him.

30:33.319 --> 30:34.586
He's calling
from Sand Island.

30:54.290 --> 30:56.492
Danny!

31:00.213 --> 31:01.380
No.

31:13.009 --> 31:15.010
Oh, man.

31:33.479 --> 31:35.914
Justin...

31:38.368 --> 31:40.285
God, no.

31:40.353 --> 31:41.336
Please.

31:42.956 --> 31:44.857
Mrs. Brown...

31:44.924 --> 31:46.792
Justin's dead, isn't he?

31:46.860 --> 31:48.460
He's dead.

31:48.528 --> 31:51.597
We're very, very sorry.

31:57.137 --> 31:58.470
You see?!

31:58.521 --> 32:00.139
He's dead because of you!

32:00.206 --> 32:01.506
No, don't.

32:01.558 --> 32:02.941
He's dead!

32:30.003 --> 32:34.339
After you left, all the parents
got calls on our cell phones

32:34.407 --> 32:36.241
from the kidnappers.
They wanted to know

32:36.309 --> 32:38.677
if we had the money.

32:38.745 --> 32:43.432
All the other parents
wanted you to handle it.

32:43.516 --> 32:45.517
I just wanted Justin back.

32:46.986 --> 32:52.157
So I put 400,000 bucks
cash in a backpack.

32:52.225 --> 32:54.860
I thought if I gave
this guy something,

32:54.928 --> 32:57.930
he'll at least let Justin free.

32:57.997 --> 33:00.265
So I dropped off the cash.

33:00.333 --> 33:03.035
I came back here just
like he told me.

33:03.102 --> 33:06.404
We thought that was my boy--

33:06.456 --> 33:10.142
knocking on the door.

33:14.814 --> 33:16.748
Oh, God, what have I done?

33:16.816 --> 33:18.417
Huh?

33:20.920 --> 33:23.655
What have I done?

33:26.092 --> 33:28.160
So ballistics ran the slug
they pulled out of Justin.

33:28.228 --> 33:31.363
Matches the same ones that they got out
of the boat captain and the pirate.

33:31.430 --> 33:33.982
Hey, boss, how long before the kidnapper
calls back with the instructions?

33:34.067 --> 33:35.117
Less than a minute.

33:35.201 --> 33:37.102
What are you going to do?

33:37.170 --> 33:38.153
That's him.

33:42.125 --> 33:44.109
Here.

33:44.177 --> 33:47.379
You didn't have to kill the kid.

33:47.446 --> 33:49.848
Yeah, but I did get
your attention, didn't I?

33:49.916 --> 33:51.984
Listen to me. You think you're
going to get away with this?

33:52.051 --> 33:53.986
It's a small island.
I'm going to find you.

33:54.053 --> 33:55.988
I don't think so, Steve.

33:56.055 --> 33:58.090
You have one hour
to get the money together

33:58.141 --> 34:00.392
or the remaining
hostages die.

34:00.460 --> 34:02.594
There will be a bus full of kids

34:02.645 --> 34:04.146
parked in a location
that I will give you

34:04.230 --> 34:06.031
the address to,
next time I call.

34:06.099 --> 34:07.149
Once you deliver the money,

34:07.233 --> 34:09.935
we'll all go to
the Honolulu Airport.

34:09.985 --> 34:11.803
Make sure there's a private
plane, fully fueled,

34:11.871 --> 34:12.938
and ready to go.

34:13.005 --> 34:15.440
Once my associates
and I are on the plane

34:15.491 --> 34:17.743
the hostages will be released.

34:17.810 --> 34:19.527
You never mentioned
a plane, okay?

34:19.612 --> 34:20.645
I need more time.

34:20.697 --> 34:22.514
You don't have it.
One hour.

34:23.516 --> 34:25.150
Okay.

34:25.201 --> 34:26.952
I'll be there.

34:27.020 --> 34:28.085
No, no, you won't be there.

34:28.154 --> 34:29.755
You think I'm walking
into a trap?

34:29.822 --> 34:33.292
Who do you want
to deliver the money?

34:33.359 --> 34:36.628
Make it the girl
from the paper this morning.

34:36.696 --> 34:38.797
The one that got away
last time.

34:38.848 --> 34:39.931
Okay, she's a civilian.

34:39.998 --> 34:41.850
You know
I can't do that.

34:41.935 --> 34:44.168
I will drop the money
personally. I'll be unarmed.

34:44.219 --> 34:46.138
You have my word, okay?

34:46.188 --> 34:48.505
No cops. I smell a setup,
the kids die, understand?

34:48.558 --> 34:52.143
Susan makes the exchange
by herself.

34:52.195 --> 34:54.780
Listen, I can't let
her do that.

34:54.847 --> 34:56.681
You don't understand--
you don't have a choice.

34:56.748 --> 34:58.183
She's the only one I know

34:58.251 --> 35:00.319
who's definitely not a cop.
I need more time.

35:00.370 --> 35:02.287
You have 59 minutes.

35:02.355 --> 35:04.356
You want to waste any more
talking to me?

35:04.424 --> 35:06.024
I didn't think so.

35:06.092 --> 35:08.043
Did you get him?

35:08.127 --> 35:09.328
He dropped the call
before we got him.

35:09.395 --> 35:11.697
Okay, HPD might
have a look-alike

35:11.764 --> 35:13.498
we could send in undercover.
No, no. We don't have time.

35:13.566 --> 35:16.385
And they burn her as a cop,
and the kids are dead.

35:16.469 --> 35:19.338
You're not seriously considering
using Susan, are you?

35:23.042 --> 35:25.310
She's the only one
who can do this job.

35:48.737 --> 35:50.204
I don't understand.
Why do they want me

35:50.272 --> 35:51.439
to do this?

35:51.562 --> 35:53.429
Because the kidnappers
saw you in the paper.

35:53.497 --> 35:55.898
They know you're
not a cop.

35:55.966 --> 35:59.602
Listen, I understand that
what we're asking of you

35:59.670 --> 36:00.870
is scary, okay?

36:00.938 --> 36:02.972
If I could do this myself,
I would, but I can't.

36:03.040 --> 36:05.742
The fact is, if you
don't help us with this,

36:05.809 --> 36:08.678
these kids are going
to end up dead.

36:10.914 --> 36:12.281
I don't know.

36:12.332 --> 36:14.383
I mean, the news said

36:14.451 --> 36:16.586
they already killed one of the kids.
Is that true?

36:16.637 --> 36:17.820
Yeah, it is.

36:17.888 --> 36:20.339
His name was Justin Brown.

36:20.424 --> 36:23.659
He was 19 years old.

36:24.678 --> 36:26.329
Susan, listen to me, okay?

36:26.396 --> 36:27.630
The money's right here.

36:27.698 --> 36:30.800
Unfortunately, you're
the only chance

36:30.868 --> 36:34.237
that these parents have of
seeing their kids alive again.

36:34.304 --> 36:36.806
These people--
they killed your friend.

36:36.874 --> 36:41.210
Susan, this is your chance
to do something about that.

36:41.278 --> 36:43.513
What if I make a mistake?

36:43.580 --> 36:46.349
I'll be right there.
We'll all be right there, okay?

36:46.416 --> 36:47.717
I promise you that.

36:48.752 --> 36:50.753
This is them.

36:50.821 --> 36:53.322
I need an answer.

36:56.894 --> 36:59.162
Susan, I need an answer.

37:01.632 --> 37:03.399
Okay.

37:06.970 --> 37:08.204
I've got your money.

37:08.272 --> 37:11.374
There's a warehouse
at 44 Industrial Way.

37:11.441 --> 37:14.076
Have the girl walk the money in.

37:14.144 --> 37:15.878
She'll return on the bus
with the rest of the hostages

37:15.946 --> 37:16.913
and be released at the airport.

37:16.980 --> 37:18.381
You have 15 minutes.

37:19.616 --> 37:20.867
Get up.

37:21.919 --> 37:23.870
Get up!

37:44.608 --> 37:46.576
It looks like the hostages
are already on the bus.

37:46.643 --> 37:50.379
We've got movement
in the warehouse and guns.

37:50.430 --> 37:51.881
Assuming it's the kidnappers.

37:51.932 --> 37:53.065
Okay, so that's...

37:57.588 --> 37:58.905
We'll be listening to what's
going on

37:58.989 --> 38:00.907
around you and this
earpiece will allow you

38:00.991 --> 38:02.575
to hear everything we say.

38:02.659 --> 38:04.193
Can you hear me
through it okay?

38:04.261 --> 38:06.362
Okay.

38:08.415 --> 38:10.900
We'll be there if anything
goes wrong, okay?

38:10.951 --> 38:12.869
You can do this, Susan.

38:12.936 --> 38:14.537
You're going to be fine.

38:14.605 --> 38:15.955
We got your back, okay?

38:16.039 --> 38:18.407
You're going to be fine.

38:43.367 --> 38:44.567
All right.

38:52.309 --> 38:53.659
All right, Susan,

38:53.744 --> 38:56.746
just do exactly as they say.

38:56.797 --> 38:59.382
This will be all over
before you know it.

39:25.943 --> 39:28.177
Told you this would work.

39:42.042 --> 39:45.327
Hey, Susan, you really think
I was going to let you

39:45.379 --> 39:47.196
just walk in there
with all that money?

39:47.264 --> 39:49.298
What the hell?!

39:49.366 --> 39:50.666
Where is it?!

39:58.442 --> 39:59.442
Move!

40:06.483 --> 40:08.017
Hey, hey!

40:08.085 --> 40:09.085
Chin, Chin, Chin!

40:09.152 --> 40:11.203
I got them. Go!

40:12.255 --> 40:13.873
On the ground now!

40:27.337 --> 40:28.671
Hey!

40:28.739 --> 40:30.773
Drive.

40:30.841 --> 40:32.174
Right now!

40:32.242 --> 40:34.143
He's got a gun!

41:19.255 --> 41:19.305
How'd you know
she was in on it?

41:22.092 --> 41:25.694
The guy I talked to--
he called Susan by her name,

41:25.762 --> 41:27.963
and he said he saw
her picture

41:28.031 --> 41:29.482
in the newspaper.

41:29.566 --> 41:32.735
Except her name was never
listed in the newspaper.

41:32.803 --> 41:36.205
For Susan's safety, we asked
them not to publish it.
