WEBVTT

00:02.639 --> 00:05.095
Dad's gone. He wants us
to pick up where he left off.

00:05.267 --> 00:08.683
So, what do you say we kill some
evil sons of bitches and raise a little hell?

00:11.064 --> 00:12.558
Bela Talbot's her real name.

00:12.733 --> 00:14.939
Which means seriously bad luck
for you.

00:15.110 --> 00:17.149
A hunter?
Pretty far from a hunter.

00:17.320 --> 00:20.238
I procure unique items
for a select clientele.

00:20.407 --> 00:22.067
I think you'll find that belongs to me.

00:22.242 --> 00:23.784
You're not gonna shoot anybody.

00:25.371 --> 00:26.700
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:26.873 --> 00:29.494
I'm trying to keep you alive
and you couldn't care less.

00:29.667 --> 00:30.830
Truth is I'm tired, Sam.

00:31.002 --> 00:33.374
It's like there's a light
at the end of the tunnel.

00:33.546 --> 00:35.254
- It's hellfire, Dean.
- Eh, whatever.

00:35.423 --> 00:38.340
You're my big brother.
There's nothing I wouldn't do for you.

00:38.509 --> 00:41.131
I don't care what it takes.
I'm gonna get you out of this.

00:41.304 --> 00:45.348
- What can I do for you, Sam?
- Let Dean out of his deal right now.

00:45.516 --> 00:46.596
I'm just a saleswoman.

00:46.768 --> 00:49.223
I got a boss like everybody.
He holds the contract.

00:49.395 --> 00:53.179
- And who's your boss?
- I can't tell you. I'm sorry, Sam.

00:53.358 --> 00:55.646
But there's no way out of this one.

03:33.689 --> 03:36.144
So I've been waiting
since Maple Springs.

03:36.316 --> 03:39.436
- You got something to tell me?
- It's not your birthday.

03:39.611 --> 03:40.940
No.

03:43.532 --> 03:46.651
Happy perm? Dude, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

03:46.827 --> 03:49.115
There's a bullet missing from the Colt.

03:49.287 --> 03:51.363
Wanna tell me how that happened?

03:52.082 --> 03:55.036
It wasn't me, so unless you were
shooting at some evil cans...

03:55.210 --> 03:57.119
- Dean.
- You went after her, didn't you?

03:57.295 --> 03:59.537
The Crossroads Demon,
after I told you not to.

04:00.298 --> 04:02.789
- Yeah, well.
- You could have gotten yourself killed.

04:02.968 --> 04:05.092
- I didn't.
- And you shot her.

04:05.263 --> 04:06.425
She was a smart-ass.

04:08.975 --> 04:11.014
So, what, does that mean
I'm out of my deal?

04:12.186 --> 04:15.390
Don't you think I might have
mentioned that little fact, Dean?

04:16.274 --> 04:19.857
- No. Someone else holds the contract.
- Who?

04:20.028 --> 04:21.605
She wouldn't say.

04:24.907 --> 04:26.450
Well, we should find out who.

04:27.410 --> 04:30.577
Of course, our best lead
would be the Crossroads Demon.

04:30.747 --> 04:32.656
- Oh, wait a minute.
- That's not funny.

04:32.832 --> 04:35.916
No, it's not. It was a stupid risk
and you shouldn't have done it.

04:36.085 --> 04:37.283
I shouldn't have done it?

04:37.462 --> 04:40.913
You're my brother. No matter what
you do, I'm gonna try and save you.

04:41.090 --> 04:44.210
And I'm sure as hell not gonna
apologize for it, all right?

04:51.518 --> 04:52.977
But I don't understand.

04:53.145 --> 04:55.766
I already went over all this
with the other detectives.

04:55.939 --> 04:59.308
Right, yes, uh, but see,
we're with the Sheriff's Department...

04:59.485 --> 05:02.023
...not the Police Department.
Different departments.

05:02.196 --> 05:07.570
- So, Mrs. Case...
- Please: Ms. Case.

05:11.997 --> 05:13.705
Okay, um...

05:14.666 --> 05:16.873
...Ms. Case, um...

05:17.378 --> 05:19.619
...you were the one
who found your niece, correct?

05:19.797 --> 05:23.581
- I came home, she was in the shower.
- Drowned?

05:24.176 --> 05:26.797
So the coroner says.
Now you tell me.

05:26.970 --> 05:28.928
How can someone drown in a shower?

05:29.098 --> 05:31.934
How would you describe
Sheila's behavior before her death?

05:32.102 --> 05:33.430
I mean, did she seem frightened?

05:33.603 --> 05:35.762
Maybe she said something
out of the ordinary...?

05:36.356 --> 05:40.603
Wait a minute.
You're working with Alex, aren't you?

05:41.695 --> 05:45.775
Yep. Absolutely. That's, ha, ha...
Alex and us, we're like this.

05:45.949 --> 05:51.868
Why didn't you say so?
Alex has been such a comfort.

05:52.038 --> 05:55.822
But I'm sorry,
I thought the case was solved.

05:56.376 --> 05:58.618
Uh, well, no. No, not yet.

05:58.795 --> 06:00.075
I see.

06:00.255 --> 06:02.331
Anyways, we were talking
about your niece.

06:02.507 --> 06:07.003
Well, yes, Sheila mentioned something
quite strange before she died.

06:07.804 --> 06:10.924
- She said she saw a boat.
- Boat?

06:11.516 --> 06:13.556
Yes, one minute it was there,
then it was gone.

06:13.727 --> 06:15.767
It just disappeared
right before her eyes.

06:17.481 --> 06:20.435
You think it could be a ghost ship?

06:23.320 --> 06:25.693
Alex thinks it could be a ghost ship.

06:26.949 --> 06:28.823
Well, uh...

06:29.660 --> 06:31.285
...could be.

06:32.580 --> 06:34.122
Well...

06:34.457 --> 06:37.623
...you let me know
if there's anything else I can do for you.

06:45.968 --> 06:47.427
Anything at all.

06:55.394 --> 06:57.719
What a crazy old broad.

06:57.897 --> 06:59.641
Why, because she believes in ghosts?

06:59.858 --> 07:03.108
Ha, ha. Look at you sticking up
for your girlfriend, you cougar hound.

07:03.278 --> 07:05.983
- Bite me.
- Hey, not if she bites you first.

07:06.156 --> 07:08.232
So who's this Alex?
We got another player in town?

07:08.408 --> 07:10.615
Maybe, maybe not.
Doesn't change our job.

07:10.786 --> 07:12.066
We're thinking ghost ship?

07:12.245 --> 07:14.534
- Not the first one that's been sighted.
- Really?

07:14.706 --> 07:17.992
Yeah, every 37 years, like clockwork,
reports of a vanishing...

07:18.168 --> 07:20.208
...three-mast clipper ship
out in the bay.

07:20.379 --> 07:24.163
And every 37 years, a rash
of weirdo dry-land drownings.

07:24.341 --> 07:26.132
Whatever's happening
is getting started?

07:26.301 --> 07:27.843
- Yeah.
- What's the lore?

07:28.011 --> 07:30.882
There are apparitions of old wrecks
sighted all over the world.

07:31.056 --> 07:34.092
<i>The S.S. Violet, the Griffon,
the Flying Dutchman.</i>

07:34.267 --> 07:35.927
Almost all of them are death omens.

07:36.103 --> 07:38.012
So you see the ship,
then a few hours later...

07:38.188 --> 07:40.015
...you pucker up
and kiss your ass goodbye?

07:40.190 --> 07:42.396
- Basically.
- What's the next step?

07:42.567 --> 07:44.561
- I gotta ID the boat.
- Shouldn't be too hard.

07:44.737 --> 07:47.442
How many three-mast clipper ships
are wrecked off the coast?

07:47.615 --> 07:49.442
I checked that too, actually.

07:49.617 --> 07:51.242
Over 150.

07:51.994 --> 07:53.074
- Wow.
- Yeah.

07:53.246 --> 07:54.360
- Crap.
- Mm-hm.

08:05.007 --> 08:06.881
This is where we parked the car, right?

08:07.051 --> 08:08.795
I thought so.

08:09.178 --> 08:11.005
Where's my car?

08:11.931 --> 08:14.007
Did you feed the meter?

08:14.392 --> 08:15.851
Yes, I fed the meter.

08:16.018 --> 08:17.976
Sam, where's my car?
Somebody stole my car?

08:18.146 --> 08:19.260
Hey, hey, calm down, Dean.

08:19.439 --> 08:21.312
I am calmed down. Someone stole my...

08:23.735 --> 08:26.819
Wow, Dean. Hey, hey, hey, take it easy.
Take it easy.

08:26.989 --> 08:31.033
The '67 Impala? Was that yours?

08:31.243 --> 08:34.577
- Bela.
- I'm sorry, I had that car towed.

08:34.746 --> 08:37.451
- You what?
- Well, it was in a tow-away zone.

08:37.624 --> 08:40.412
- No, it wasn't.
- It was when I finished with it.

08:40.586 --> 08:42.376
What the hell are you even doing here?

08:43.172 --> 08:45.841
- A little yachting.
- You're Alex.

08:47.051 --> 08:50.585
- You're working with that old lady.
- Gert's a dear old friend.

08:51.430 --> 08:53.885
- Yeah, right. What's your angle?
- There's no angle.

08:54.058 --> 08:56.216
There's a lot of lovely old women
like Gert...

08:56.393 --> 08:58.137
...up and down the eastern seaboard.

08:58.312 --> 09:00.351
I sell them charms, perform sÃ©ances...

09:00.522 --> 09:02.681
...so they can commune
with their dead cats.

09:02.858 --> 09:04.898
And let me guess.
All a con, none of it's real.

09:05.069 --> 09:07.939
The comfort I provide them
is very real.

09:08.572 --> 09:09.947
How do you sleep at night?

09:11.201 --> 09:13.407
On silk sheets, rolling naked in money.

09:15.455 --> 09:18.326
Really, Sam. I'd expect the attitude
from him. But you?

09:19.000 --> 09:21.871
- You shot me.
- I barely grazed you.

09:24.297 --> 09:27.049
Cute, but a bit of a drama queen,
yeah?

09:27.217 --> 09:30.171
You do know what's going on here.
This ghost ship thing, it is real.

09:30.345 --> 09:31.887
I'm aware.

09:32.055 --> 09:34.724
Thanks for telling Gert
the case wasn't solved, by the way.

09:34.891 --> 09:37.263
- It isn't.
- She didn't know that.

09:37.435 --> 09:40.851
Now the old bag's stopped payment
and she's demanding some real answers.

09:41.773 --> 09:45.521
Look, just stay out of my way
before you cause any more trouble.

09:47.529 --> 09:49.652
I'd get to that car if I were you...

09:49.823 --> 09:52.278
...before they find the arsenal
in the trunk.

09:56.956 --> 09:58.913
Can I shoot her?

09:59.834 --> 10:01.826
Not in public.

10:16.600 --> 10:17.976
Hello?

11:06.526 --> 11:11.484
No, the police said that he drowned,
but I don't understand how...

11:11.656 --> 11:14.693
I am so sorry for your loss, Mr. Warren.

11:14.868 --> 11:17.738
If you could tell me one more time
about the ship your brother saw?

11:17.912 --> 11:21.281
Ma'am, I think this man's been
through quite enough. You should go.

11:21.458 --> 11:24.578
- But I just have a few more questions.
- No, you don't.

11:27.256 --> 11:29.498
Thank you for your time.

11:31.969 --> 11:35.421
Sorry you had to deal with that.
They're like roaches.

11:37.099 --> 11:40.266
So, uh, we heard you say your brother
saw a ship?

11:40.436 --> 11:44.101
- Yeah, that's right.
- Did he tell you what it looked like?

11:46.108 --> 11:51.185
It was, uh, like the old Yankee Clippers,
a smuggling vessel.

11:51.364 --> 11:53.819
A rakish topsail, a barkentine rigging.

11:53.991 --> 11:55.783
Angel figurehead on the bow.

11:55.951 --> 11:58.074
A lot of detail for a ship
your brother saw.

11:58.245 --> 12:00.452
My brother and I were night diving.

12:00.623 --> 12:01.821
I saw the ship too.

12:04.335 --> 12:07.456
Excuse me, officers.
I'm not sure those men...

12:09.591 --> 12:12.711
- Uh, all right. Well, we'll be in touch.
- Thank you.

12:17.057 --> 12:19.346
I see you got your car back.

12:19.559 --> 12:21.766
You really wanna come near me
when I got a loaded gun?

12:21.937 --> 12:24.428
Now, now, mind your blood pressure.

12:24.606 --> 12:28.307
Why are you even still here?
You have enough to ID the boat.

12:28.485 --> 12:30.810
That guy back there saw the ship.

12:31.905 --> 12:34.859
- Yeah, and?
- And he's going to die.

12:35.033 --> 12:36.196
So we have to save him.

12:36.952 --> 12:38.280
How sweet.

12:39.538 --> 12:41.614
- You think this is funny?
- He's cannon fodder.

12:41.790 --> 12:44.198
He can't be saved in time
and you know it.

12:46.712 --> 12:50.081
Yeah, well, see, we have souls.
So we're gonna try.

12:50.257 --> 12:53.212
Well, I'm actually gonna find the ship
and put an end to this.

12:53.386 --> 12:54.549
But you have fun.

13:00.018 --> 13:01.975
Hey, Bela,
how'd you get like this, huh?

13:02.145 --> 13:04.433
What, did Daddy not give you
enough hugs or something?

13:04.605 --> 13:06.978
I don't know.
Your daddy give you enough?

13:08.985 --> 13:13.148
Don't you dare look down your nose
at me. You're no better than I am.

13:13.323 --> 13:15.280
- We help people.
- Come on.

13:15.450 --> 13:18.071
You do this out of vengeance
and obsession.

13:18.244 --> 13:21.280
You're a stone's throw
from being a serial killer.

13:22.957 --> 13:26.243
Whereas I, on the other hand,
I get paid to do a job, and I do it.

13:26.419 --> 13:29.622
So you tell me, which is healthier?

13:29.797 --> 13:33.047
Bela, why don't you just leave?
We've got work to do.

13:33.217 --> 13:36.753
Yeah, you're 0 for 2.
Bang-up job so far.

13:57.868 --> 13:59.493
Anything good?

13:59.662 --> 14:01.037
No, not really.

14:01.205 --> 14:04.574
I mean, both brothers
are Duke University grads.

14:04.750 --> 14:06.125
No criminal record.

14:06.293 --> 14:08.867
I mean, a few speeding tickets.

14:09.338 --> 14:12.505
They inherited their father's
real-estate fortune six years ago.

14:12.675 --> 14:15.510
- How much?
- Hundred twelve million.

14:16.387 --> 14:17.845
- Nice life.
- Yeah.

14:18.014 --> 14:20.470
I mean, nice, clean, aboveboard.

14:20.642 --> 14:22.967
So why'd they see the ship?

14:23.937 --> 14:25.135
Why Sheila too?

14:25.313 --> 14:27.472
- What do they all have in common?
- Maybe nothing.

14:27.649 --> 14:28.894
There's always something.

14:29.067 --> 14:30.691
Hey, you!

14:32.153 --> 14:34.229
Think we've been made.

14:35.740 --> 14:37.365
What are you doing? You watching me?

14:37.534 --> 14:38.862
Sir, calm down, please.

14:39.035 --> 14:41.158
You guys aren't cops.

14:41.329 --> 14:43.820
Not dressed like that.
Not in that crappy car.

14:43.999 --> 14:46.999
- Whoa, hey, no need to get nasty.
- Look, we are cops, okay?

14:47.168 --> 14:49.327
We're undercover.
We think you're in danger.

14:49.504 --> 14:51.378
- From who?
- Lf you just settle down...

14:51.548 --> 14:54.465
...we'll talk about it.
- You guys, just stay away from me.

14:55.885 --> 14:57.380
Wait.

15:00.181 --> 15:03.018
Hey, you moron,
we're trying to help you.

15:12.278 --> 15:15.398
- That can't be good.
- No. Get the salt gun.

15:39.430 --> 15:40.972
Peter.

15:42.391 --> 15:43.470
Sam!

16:11.045 --> 16:13.963
<i>What started out
as a mild chance of breezy night...</i>

16:14.132 --> 16:16.420
<i>...is changing rapidly
as a severe weather front...</i>

16:16.592 --> 16:18.466
<i>...is heading in from the northwest.</i>

16:18.636 --> 16:22.965
<i>Expect heavy lightning and thunder
with sudden rainfall...</i>

16:23.141 --> 16:25.513
You wanna say it or should I?

16:26.978 --> 16:29.932
- What?
- You can't save everybody, Sam.

16:32.151 --> 16:34.820
Yeah, right. So what,
you feel better now or what?

16:36.363 --> 16:39.281
- No, not really.
- Me neither.

16:42.870 --> 16:46.404
- You gotta understand...
- Lately I feel like I can't save anybody.

17:33.088 --> 17:35.709
Dear God.

17:35.882 --> 17:38.207
Are you actually squatting?

17:38.384 --> 17:40.176
Charming.

17:41.096 --> 17:44.132
So. How'd things
go last night with Peter?

17:47.602 --> 17:48.847
That well, huh?

17:49.020 --> 17:53.148
If you say "I told you so,"
I swear to God, I'll start swinging.

17:53.316 --> 17:57.314
Look, I think the three of us
should have a heart-to-heart.

17:57.487 --> 18:00.608
- That's assuming you have a heart.
- Dean, please.

18:01.909 --> 18:04.661
I'm sorry about what I said before,
okay?

18:04.829 --> 18:06.537
I come bearing gifts.

18:08.040 --> 18:11.374
- Such as?
- I've ID'd the ship.

18:15.923 --> 18:17.382
<i>It's the Espirito Santo.</i>

18:17.550 --> 18:21.215
A merchant sailing vessel.
Quite a colorful history.

18:21.470 --> 18:23.546
In 1859,
a sailor was accused of treason.

18:23.722 --> 18:26.427
He was tried aboard ship
in a kangaroo court and hanged.

18:26.600 --> 18:29.601
- He was 37.
- Which would explain the 37-year cycle.

18:29.770 --> 18:34.765
Aren't you a sharp tack?
Photo of him somewhere. Here.

18:38.404 --> 18:41.358
- Isn't that the customer we saw?
- You saw him?

18:41.532 --> 18:43.858
Yeah. That's him,
except he was missing a hand.

18:44.035 --> 18:46.443
- His right hand.
- How did you know?

18:46.621 --> 18:47.736
The body was cremated...

18:47.914 --> 18:50.156
...but they cut off his hand
to make a Hand of Glory.

18:50.333 --> 18:51.792
A Hand of Glory?

18:51.960 --> 18:55.411
I think I got one of those at the end
of my Thai massage last week. Ha, ha.

18:56.882 --> 18:59.455
The right hand of a hanged man
is a serious occult object.

18:59.634 --> 19:00.714
It's very powerful.

19:00.886 --> 19:03.258
- So they say.
- And officially counts as remains.

19:03.430 --> 19:05.968
None of this explains why the ghost
is choosing these victims.

19:06.141 --> 19:07.968
I'll tell you why.

19:08.143 --> 19:12.472
Who cares? Find the hand, burn it
and stop the bloody thing.

19:12.647 --> 19:14.272
Why you telling us all this?

19:14.441 --> 19:16.517
Because I know exactly
where the hand is.

19:16.693 --> 19:19.398
- Where?
- At the Sea Pines Museum...

19:19.571 --> 19:21.896
...as a macabre bit of maritime history.

19:23.450 --> 19:25.859
- But I need help.
- What kind of help?

19:28.831 --> 19:33.078
What is taking so long?
Sam's already halfway there.

19:33.252 --> 19:35.790
- With his date.
- So not okay with this.

19:35.963 --> 19:37.671
What are you, a woman?

19:37.840 --> 19:39.584
Come down already.

19:56.400 --> 19:58.773
All right. Get it out. I look ridiculous.

19:59.320 --> 20:01.194
Not exactly the word I'd use.

20:01.906 --> 20:02.985
What?

20:03.157 --> 20:06.075
You know, when this is over,
we should really have angry sex.

20:15.921 --> 20:17.748
Don't objectify me.

20:20.217 --> 20:21.960
Let's go.

20:55.503 --> 20:57.626
Are you chewing gum?

20:58.089 --> 21:02.004
Try to behave as if you've lived
this life before, yeah?

21:25.784 --> 21:28.701
This will get their tongues wagging,
eh, my Adonis?

21:28.870 --> 21:31.741
Just remember, we're on business.

21:31.915 --> 21:34.785
But sometimes business
can be pleasure, hmm?

21:34.959 --> 21:36.454
Right.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.759
You know, uh, could you excuse me
for a moment?

21:46.931 --> 21:49.338
Great, thanks. Thanks.

21:51.602 --> 21:55.220
Exactly how long do you expect me
to entertain my date?

21:55.398 --> 21:56.940
As long as it takes.

21:57.108 --> 21:58.483
Look...

21:58.651 --> 22:00.228
...security all over this place.

22:00.403 --> 22:03.107
This is an uncrashable party
without Gert's invitation, so...

22:03.280 --> 22:04.360
We can crash anything.

22:04.532 --> 22:08.066
Yeah, I know, but this is easier
and it's a lot more entertaining.

22:09.286 --> 22:11.528
You know, there are limits
to what I'll do, right?

22:11.705 --> 22:13.994
Aw, he's playing hard to get.
That's cute.

22:15.793 --> 22:17.287
Come on.

22:18.712 --> 22:20.622
I want all the details in the morning.

22:20.798 --> 22:21.878
Hm.

22:22.050 --> 22:23.877
Thank you.

22:35.355 --> 22:37.063
To us.

22:58.879 --> 23:00.159
Private security?

23:00.338 --> 23:01.453
I don't think so.

23:01.631 --> 23:04.253
Look at the way they're standing.
They're pros.

23:04.426 --> 23:06.918
Probably state troopers moonlighting.

23:07.722 --> 23:09.761
Posted at every door too.

23:09.932 --> 23:12.969
Yeah, I don't think we're gonna be able
to just waltz upstairs.

23:13.519 --> 23:14.895
What do you suggest?

23:15.730 --> 23:17.521
I'm thinking.

23:18.816 --> 23:20.358
Don't strain yourself.

23:21.694 --> 23:24.446
Interesting how the legend
is so much more than the man.

23:26.324 --> 23:28.198
You got any bright ideas, I'm all ears.

23:28.659 --> 23:30.070
Okay.

23:32.830 --> 23:35.831
Honey? Honey, are you all right?

23:36.876 --> 23:38.501
Waiter.

23:39.629 --> 23:42.380
My wife has a severe shellfish allergy.
There's no crab in them?

23:42.548 --> 23:44.707
- No, sir.
- No?

23:45.468 --> 23:48.220
- They're excellent, by the way.
- What seems to be the trouble?

23:48.387 --> 23:50.132
Ahh, champagne.

23:50.766 --> 23:52.842
She's a lightweight
when it comes to the sauce.

23:53.018 --> 23:56.387
Is there somewhere I can lay her down
till she gets her sea legs back?

23:57.981 --> 24:00.307
- Follow me.
- Right.

24:00.776 --> 24:02.021
Thank you.

24:02.194 --> 24:03.474
Come on, you lush.

24:10.369 --> 24:12.611
You think she's a pain in the ass now?

24:12.788 --> 24:15.077
Try living with her.
Thank you very much.

24:22.339 --> 24:25.126
Maybe next time, give me
a little heads up with your plan.

24:25.717 --> 24:28.671
I didn't want you thinking.
You're not very good at that.

24:32.057 --> 24:35.474
Oh, look at you.
Searching for a witty rejoinder.

24:35.645 --> 24:36.808
Screw you.

24:36.980 --> 24:38.889
Very Oscar Wilde.

24:41.568 --> 24:43.940
Room 235.

24:44.112 --> 24:46.437
It's in a locked glass case
wired for alarm.

24:46.614 --> 24:48.406
I'm sure that won't be a problem?

25:02.589 --> 25:04.498
Where's Alex and your friend?

25:04.674 --> 25:07.379
They're missing a great party.

25:07.552 --> 25:10.886
I'm, ahh... I'm sure
they're entertaining themselves.

25:11.055 --> 25:13.891
Ooh, naughty.

25:15.268 --> 25:18.389
Then I guess we'll just have
to entertain ourselves as well.

25:18.564 --> 25:20.224
Oh, ahh...

25:20.399 --> 25:23.186
Ha. You know, um, Mrs. Case...

25:23.360 --> 25:25.602
- Oh, no.
- Sorry.

25:25.780 --> 25:28.152
Ms. Case, I don't wanna give you
the wrong idea.

25:28.616 --> 25:30.158
Call me Gert.

25:30.659 --> 25:32.237
Okay.

25:32.495 --> 25:36.991
You remind me of my late husband.
He was shy too.

25:37.333 --> 25:39.207
Till we got below deck.

25:39.376 --> 25:42.046
Whoa! Ahem.

25:43.464 --> 25:46.381
Mm. You're just firm all over.

26:32.806 --> 26:37.135
Sir? Ma'am? Everything all right?

26:39.896 --> 26:41.391
Hi.

26:41.565 --> 26:43.023
Feeling better, I see.

26:44.193 --> 26:46.898
Yes, much, thank you.

26:47.530 --> 26:49.653
So if you're done with the room?

26:50.616 --> 26:54.317
Well, not exactly.
Could we have a few more minutes?

26:55.997 --> 26:57.159
Yes, ma'am.

27:00.877 --> 27:03.996
Stop it. That tickles.

27:08.634 --> 27:11.007
Whoa! Sorry.

27:11.179 --> 27:14.180
- Ahh, nature called.
- Uh-huh.

27:14.474 --> 27:16.347
Thanks for looking after my wife.

27:16.517 --> 27:19.803
Oh, she's being looked after all right.

27:30.824 --> 27:33.031
- Any trouble?
- Nothing I couldn't handle.

27:34.661 --> 27:36.286
The hand?

27:39.750 --> 27:42.075
- May I?
- No.

27:43.420 --> 27:45.294
It might be more inconspicuous
in my purse.

27:45.464 --> 27:46.958
Nice try.

27:47.716 --> 27:49.091
Just trying to be helpful.

27:49.259 --> 27:51.051
Well, sweetheart...

27:51.220 --> 27:53.046
...I don't need your kind of help.

27:59.186 --> 28:01.344
Man, this is one long song.

28:01.522 --> 28:03.929
I hope it never ends.

28:06.193 --> 28:08.020
How's the investigation going?

28:08.695 --> 28:10.569
These things take time.

28:10.739 --> 28:13.860
You know, people are talking
about the Warren brothers' deaths.

28:15.537 --> 28:16.616
Strange.

28:17.288 --> 28:19.364
Do you think it's connected
to Sheila's?

28:20.458 --> 28:22.202
Yeah. Yeah, we think so.

28:22.377 --> 28:25.960
I think they had it coming, you know,
in a Biblical sort of way.

28:27.966 --> 28:29.590
What do you mean?

28:30.718 --> 28:33.174
You know about their father.

28:33.346 --> 28:34.924
No.

28:35.098 --> 28:37.968
Come here. I'll whisper it to you.

28:38.435 --> 28:40.308
- Ahh...!
- People say...

28:41.312 --> 28:42.723
...that the old man...

28:42.897 --> 28:45.815
...didn't die of natural causes.
- Then how?

28:45.984 --> 28:49.684
Rumor is the boys did it.

28:50.447 --> 28:52.356
Nothing was ever proved...

28:53.408 --> 28:56.030
...but, uh, people still whisper.
- Okay, okay.

28:56.203 --> 28:59.370
Um, so did Sheila
have any connection to them?

28:59.915 --> 29:01.458
Well, none that I know of.

29:01.625 --> 29:03.867
Did Sheila have any kind of tragedy
in her life?

29:04.044 --> 29:06.084
Yes, as a matter of fact...

29:06.255 --> 29:09.920
...there was a car accident
when she was a teenager.

29:10.092 --> 29:13.378
- What happened?
- Her car flipped over and, uh...

29:13.554 --> 29:18.263
...well, she was okay,
but, uh, her cousin Brian was killed.

29:18.434 --> 29:19.845
Why? Is that important?

29:22.188 --> 29:25.438
Well, having a nice time?

29:26.192 --> 29:28.599
He's delightful.

29:29.195 --> 29:30.772
- He wants me.
- Oh.

29:33.824 --> 29:35.864
I'm going to get Gert
into a cold shower.

29:36.035 --> 29:38.111
Great idea.

29:39.455 --> 29:41.579
See you at the cemetery.

29:45.587 --> 29:47.627
You stink like sex.

29:58.266 --> 29:59.511
You got it, right?

30:00.143 --> 30:03.808
Tell me I didn't get groped all night
by Mrs. Haversham for nothing.

30:03.980 --> 30:05.558
I got it. Mrs. Who?

30:05.732 --> 30:08.306
Never mind. Just let me see it.

30:14.074 --> 30:15.568
What?

30:21.248 --> 30:23.157
I'm gonna kill her.

30:43.312 --> 30:44.641
Oh, no.

31:06.544 --> 31:09.415
You know what? You're right.
Not gonna kill her.

31:09.589 --> 31:11.582
I think slow torture's the way to go.

31:11.758 --> 31:13.300
Dean, look. You gotta relax.

31:13.468 --> 31:16.505
Relax? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'll relax.

31:16.680 --> 31:19.385
Can't believe she got another one
over on us.

31:20.142 --> 31:21.850
You.

31:25.063 --> 31:26.641
What?

31:27.315 --> 31:31.230
I mean, she got one over on you,
not us.

31:35.032 --> 31:37.701
Thank you, Sam. Very helpful.

31:41.163 --> 31:43.155
Hello. Could you open up?

31:49.546 --> 31:51.337
Just let me explain.

31:52.550 --> 31:56.085
I sold it. I had a buyer lined up
as soon as I knew it existed.

32:01.184 --> 32:03.472
So the reason for us
going to the charity ball was...?

32:03.644 --> 32:04.724
I needed a cover.

32:05.980 --> 32:07.605
You were convenient.

32:07.774 --> 32:10.312
Look, you sold it to a buyer,
just go buy it back.

32:10.485 --> 32:13.154
It's halfway across the ocean.
I can't get it back in time.

32:13.780 --> 32:15.357
In time for what?

32:18.076 --> 32:21.242
What's going on with you, Bela?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

32:21.412 --> 32:22.741
I saw the ship.

32:23.331 --> 32:24.576
You what?

32:30.338 --> 32:33.873
Wow, you know, I knew you were
an immoral, thieving, con-artist bitch.

32:34.050 --> 32:36.756
But when I thought my opinion of you
couldn't get any lower...

32:36.929 --> 32:40.796
- What are you talking about?
- We figured out the spirit's motive.

32:45.312 --> 32:47.886
This is the captain of our ship...

32:48.065 --> 32:50.188
...the one who hung our ghost boy.

32:50.359 --> 32:51.521
So?

32:51.694 --> 32:53.069
So they were brothers.

32:56.240 --> 32:57.354
Very Cain and Abel.

32:57.908 --> 33:01.858
So now our spirit, he's going after
a very specific kind of target.

33:02.287 --> 33:05.075
People who've spilled
their own family's blood.

33:05.833 --> 33:08.502
First there was Sheila,
who killed her cousin in a car accident.

33:08.669 --> 33:10.163
Then the Warren brothers...

33:10.337 --> 33:13.587
...who murdered their father
for the inheritance.

33:13.841 --> 33:16.758
- And now you.
- Oh, my God.

33:16.927 --> 33:18.967
So who was it, Bela?

33:19.139 --> 33:20.549
Hmm?

33:20.724 --> 33:23.215
Who'd you kill? Was it Daddy?

33:23.393 --> 33:25.017
Your little sis, maybe?

33:26.938 --> 33:28.349
It's none of your business.

33:28.523 --> 33:29.934
No.

33:30.108 --> 33:31.388
Right.

33:31.568 --> 33:34.059
Well, have a nice life.
You know, whatever's left of it.

33:37.615 --> 33:39.407
Sam. Let's go.

33:40.535 --> 33:41.946
You can't just leave me here.

33:43.747 --> 33:47.447
- Watch us.
- Please.

33:49.461 --> 33:50.871
I need your help.

33:52.047 --> 33:53.754
Our help?

33:54.549 --> 33:56.957
Now, how could serial killers
possibly help you?

33:57.135 --> 33:58.250
Okay, that was harsh.

33:58.428 --> 34:00.302
But it doesn't warrant
a death sentence.

34:00.472 --> 34:02.049
That's not why you're gonna die.

34:05.102 --> 34:06.644
What did you do, Bela?

34:06.812 --> 34:08.639
You wouldn't understand.

34:08.813 --> 34:10.225
No one did.

34:14.862 --> 34:16.605
Never mind.

34:16.781 --> 34:20.197
I'll just do what I've always done
and I'll deal with it myself.

34:21.034 --> 34:24.071
You do realize you just sold
the only thing that could save your life?

34:26.540 --> 34:28.284
I'm aware.

34:29.293 --> 34:30.786
Well...

34:33.839 --> 34:35.998
Maybe not the only thing.

34:58.490 --> 35:00.946
Do you really think this is gonna work?

35:01.118 --> 35:02.826
Almost definitely not.

35:17.426 --> 35:20.925
Sammy. Better start reading.

35:46.164 --> 35:47.955
Stay close.

35:51.836 --> 35:53.247
Behind you!

36:22.409 --> 36:25.161
Sammy, read faster.

36:52.773 --> 36:56.391
You hanged me.

36:56.860 --> 36:58.023
I'm sorry.

37:01.032 --> 37:02.906
Your own brother.

37:03.076 --> 37:04.903
I'm so sorry.

37:47.012 --> 37:50.179
You should learn to lock your doors.
Anyone could just barge in.

37:50.849 --> 37:52.130
Anyone just did.

37:52.643 --> 37:54.885
You come to say goodbye
or thank you?

37:55.062 --> 37:57.054
I've come to settle affairs.

37:57.231 --> 38:00.018
Giving the spirit what he really wanted,
his own brother.

38:00.192 --> 38:02.517
Very clever, Sam. So here.

38:04.029 --> 38:06.698
It's 10,000. That should cover it.

38:09.952 --> 38:12.324
I don't like being in anyone's debt.

38:12.496 --> 38:16.446
So ponying up 10 grand is easier
for you than a simple "thank you"?

38:17.918 --> 38:19.460
You're so damaged.

38:20.129 --> 38:21.327
Takes one to know one.

38:24.258 --> 38:26.131
Goodbye, lads.

38:32.642 --> 38:34.967
She got style. You gotta give her that.

38:35.145 --> 38:36.520
I suppose.

38:37.480 --> 38:40.102
You know, Dean, we don't know
where this money's been.

38:40.275 --> 38:41.650
No.

38:41.818 --> 38:43.526
But I know where it's going.

38:48.450 --> 38:51.201
Seriously? Atlantic City?

38:51.369 --> 38:52.567
Hell, yeah.

38:52.746 --> 38:56.695
Play some roulette,
always bet on black.

39:00.128 --> 39:02.833
Hey, listen,
I've been doing some thinking, um...

39:03.006 --> 39:05.497
I want you to know
I understand why you did it.

39:05.675 --> 39:09.044
I understand why you went
after the Crossroads Demon.

39:10.221 --> 39:13.556
The situation was reversed,
I guess I'd have done the same thing.

39:15.352 --> 39:17.392
I mean, I'm not blind.

39:17.855 --> 39:20.560
I see what you're going through
with this whole deal.

39:20.733 --> 39:23.140
Me going away and all that.

39:24.653 --> 39:26.278
But you're gonna be okay.

39:29.116 --> 39:30.279
You think so?

39:30.451 --> 39:32.325
Yeah, you'll keep hunting.

39:32.495 --> 39:34.321
You know, you'll live your life.

39:34.497 --> 39:37.332
You're stronger than me. You are.

39:37.500 --> 39:39.706
You are. You'll get over it.

39:39.877 --> 39:42.000
But I want you to know I'm sorry.

39:42.171 --> 39:44.377
I'm sorry for putting you
through all this, I am.

39:44.548 --> 39:47.419
You know what, Dean?
Go screw yourself.

39:47.593 --> 39:50.214
- What?
- I don't want an apology from you.

39:50.387 --> 39:52.594
I'm a big boy now.
I can take care of myself.

39:52.765 --> 39:55.886
- Oh, well, excuse me.
- So would you quit worrying about me?

39:56.061 --> 39:57.685
I mean, that's the whole problem.

39:57.854 --> 39:59.811
I don't want you to worry about me,
Dean.

39:59.981 --> 40:01.524
I want you to worry about you.

40:02.025 --> 40:04.433
I want you to give a crap
that you're dying.

40:09.282 --> 40:12.070
So that's it?
Nothing else to say from you?

40:15.997 --> 40:17.871
I think maybe I'll play craps.

40:56.789 --> 40:58.865
