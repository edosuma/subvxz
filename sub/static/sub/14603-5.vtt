Carrie Bradshaw.</i>

00:08.125 --> 00:11.624
<i>It's 1984. Ronald Reagan
and shoulder pads</i>

00:11.625 --> 00:14.091

I'm trying to figure out</i>

00:14.092 --> 00:16.190

with the help of my family,</i>

00:16.190 --> 00:19.290
<i>my best friends,
a sexy new guy,</i>

00:19.291 --> 00:21.324
<i>and a hot, new city.</i>

00:21.325 --> 00:23.824
<i>Figuring out who I was
and finding my voice</i>

00:23.825 --> 00:25.690
<i>wasn't going to be easy,</i>

00:25.691 --> 00:28.591
<i>but I was pretty sure it was
going to be a lot of fun.</i>

00:35.658 --> 00:38.023
<i>Some things
come with a territory--</i>

00:38.024 --> 00:40.225
<i>Being bored out of your mind
while filing--</i>

00:40.226 --> 00:41.925
<i>Well, that's obvious...</i>

00:43.925 --> 00:47.957
<i>While other moments
might surprise you.</i>

00:47.958 --> 00:50.557
Oh. Sorry. Are you all right?
Oh! Oh, I am so sorry.

00:50.558 --> 00:51.625
Yeah. It was my fault.
Sorry.

00:51.626 --> 00:53.657
Ow. Uh...
ow.

00:54.858 --> 00:57.290
<i>Meeting a cute guy
at your internship--</i>

00:57.291 --> 00:59.525
<i>Well, that's not something
that happens every day.</i>

00:59.526 --> 01:01.490
I'm George.

01:01.491 --> 01:03.057
Yeah. I'm... klutzy.
Sorry.

01:03.058 --> 01:04.891
Think you're selling yourself
a bit short.

01:04.891 --> 01:06.090
And short.

01:06.091 --> 01:07.757
Petite.

01:07.758 --> 01:09.025
You're charming.

01:09.026 --> 01:12.224
So, klutzy, do you have
a first name or last?

01:12.225 --> 01:14.324
I have both.
Carrie Bradshaw.

01:14.325 --> 01:16.924
Well, now I'm just insulted.

01:16.925 --> 01:18.590
I don't understand.

01:18.591 --> 01:20.224
You don't remember me?

01:20.225 --> 01:21.690
Have we met?

01:21.691 --> 01:23.491
I came out to your house.
You did?

01:23.492 --> 01:26.090
Yeah, I was about 7,
and you were 4.

01:26.091 --> 01:27.891
And I rubbed poison Ivy
all over us.

01:27.892 --> 01:31.224
George Silver. Yeah,
you're Harlan Silver's son.

01:31.225 --> 01:32.757
I have never forgotten you,

01:32.758 --> 01:34.956
mostly because I had to take
oatmeal baths for a week,

01:34.957 --> 01:36.491
and I almost scratched
my face off.

01:36.492 --> 01:39.690
And I never left
the city again.

01:39.691 --> 01:43.124
Well, excluding Europe,
the Hamptons, and Mustique.

01:43.125 --> 01:45.157
You're kind of pretentious.

01:45.158 --> 01:48.090
Nobody ever tells me the truth.

01:48.091 --> 01:49.591
Well, they should.

01:52.025 --> 01:55.557
Um, I should get going.
My... Boss is coming,

01:55.558 --> 01:58.090
and, well,
she doesn't exactly...

01:58.091 --> 01:59.990
George.
Barbara.

01:59.991 --> 02:01.823
You didn't have to come
to the office.

02:01.824 --> 02:04.123
I could've had your dad's driver
drop your applications off.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.658
But how could I have
brought you these?

02:05.659 --> 02:07.890
Barbara was kind enough
to have typed up

02:07.891 --> 02:09.957
my college applications for me.

02:09.958 --> 02:11.490
Well... I should...

02:11.491 --> 02:14.490
get going. Yes, you should.

02:14.491 --> 02:16.657
Hold on, Barbara.
How am I supposed to ask her

02:16.658 --> 02:20.590
to my mom's next big soiree
if she isn't here to be asked?

02:23.558 --> 02:26.657

02:26.658 --> 02:29.724

02:29.725 --> 02:32.757
Why would you say no?
Obviously, he's hideous.

02:32.758 --> 02:35.157
He's not hideous.
Fat?

02:35.158 --> 02:37.490
No, he's adorable.

who is taking a gap year

02:43.591 --> 02:45.157
between high school and college

02:45.158 --> 02:47.624
invited you to a fancy
upper east side party,

02:47.625 --> 02:48.924
and you said no?

02:48.925 --> 02:50.624
Is something wrong with you?

02:50.625 --> 02:52.724
Is it because he's dumb?

02:52.725 --> 02:53.923
Why else would someone
take a gap year?

02:53.924 --> 02:55.389
Isn't that just code
for too dumb OR too lazy

02:55.390 --> 02:56.525
to get into college?

02:56.526 --> 02:57.823
Not a reason to say no.

02:57.824 --> 03:00.091
Adorable and rich trumps
stupid and lazy any day.

03:00.092 --> 03:02.624
He's not dumb or lazy.

03:02.625 --> 03:05.657
A little entitled, but I don't
even think that's his fault.

03:05.658 --> 03:07.724
George's parents are
kinda strange.

03:07.725 --> 03:10.490
His mom's name is Kick.
Who's named Kick?

03:10.491 --> 03:11.689
Again, not a reason to say no.

03:11.690 --> 03:12.625
She's right.

03:12.626 --> 03:15.557
Just... really busy
right now,

03:15.558 --> 03:17.890
you know, with school,
my internship,

03:17.891 --> 03:19.624
studying for my driver's tests.

03:19.625 --> 03:20.825
Got a lot going on.

03:20.826 --> 03:23.057
Are you expecting us
to believe that?

03:23.058 --> 03:26.224
Studying for my driver's test
is intense.

03:26.225 --> 03:28.258
George would be a distraction.

03:30.258 --> 03:33.457
It's Sebastian.

03:33.458 --> 03:34.525
Does that make me a loser?

03:34.526 --> 03:35.690
No.
Yes.

03:35.691 --> 03:37.857
I know we're not together,

03:37.858 --> 03:41.524
But halloween just made me think
maybe there was still a chance.

03:41.525 --> 03:43.490
I think he still likes you.

03:43.491 --> 03:45.158
Why else would he be
so nice to me

03:45.159 --> 03:47.290
when I got so stoned?
Because you're awesome.

03:47.291 --> 03:49.524
And he got you stoned
in the first place.

03:49.525 --> 03:51.291
Well, I think you should
hold out hope.

03:51.292 --> 03:53.557
I did, and now Seth and I
are back together.

03:53.558 --> 03:55.689
Except you haven't sealed
the deal since your un-breakup.

03:55.690 --> 03:57.891
You need to get him in the Sack
and tie this thing up.

03:57.892 --> 03:59.889
Wow. You are mixing
your metaphors.

03:59.890 --> 04:01.156
We haven't been alone
with each other

04:01.157 --> 04:02.523
since we got back together.

04:02.524 --> 04:04.456
What about your lovey-dovey
reunion in Manhattan?

04:04.457 --> 04:05.591
They walked around.

04:05.592 --> 04:07.290
Eating ice cream.

04:07.291 --> 04:08.523
Look, guys don't care
where they are.

04:08.524 --> 04:10.358
They always want it.
Are you sure the Sex is good?

04:10.359 --> 04:13.657
I don't know.
I-I think so.

04:13.658 --> 04:14.825
Although he did break up

04:14.826 --> 04:17.790
pretty much
right after we had sex.

04:17.791 --> 04:20.357
Oh, god,
that's bad, right?
Maybe.

04:20.358 --> 04:22.924
Now that Walt and I have
done it, he can't get enough.

04:22.925 --> 04:25.157
That's what happens
when it's good.

04:25.158 --> 04:26.824
Last night, he flipped my legs--

04:26.825 --> 04:28.424
Stop.

04:28.425 --> 04:29.557
No details.

04:29.558 --> 04:31.325
We're very happy you guys
are back together,

04:31.326 --> 04:34.857
but I think it might be better
if we don't have any visuals.

04:34.858 --> 04:35.925
Yes, Walt and I are
back together,

04:35.926 --> 04:37.357
and you know why?

04:37.358 --> 04:39.790
Because I moved on,
and he could sense it.

04:39.791 --> 04:42.257
That's the only way to make
a guy interested--

04:42.258 --> 04:43.423
is to make yourself unavailable.

04:43.424 --> 04:45.091
That's what you should do
with Sebastian.

04:45.092 --> 04:47.290
But I don't wanna play games
with Sebastian.

04:47.291 --> 04:49.424
Mm. Then I hope you're willing
to lose.

Harlan.

05:14.025 --> 05:15.091
Are you still at the gym?

05:15.092 --> 05:16.857
Uh, long time gone, my friend.

05:16.858 --> 05:18.857
On to new games.
What's up?

05:18.858 --> 05:20.125
Can't find my wedding ring.

05:20.126 --> 05:21.657
I, uh, I-I put it
in my gym bag

05:21.658 --> 05:24.457
for our squash game,
and now I can't find it.

05:24.458 --> 05:25.658
Well, did you call over there?

05:25.659 --> 05:27.656
Maybe that hot girl Misty
could look for it.

05:27.657 --> 05:29.591
She knows her way
around the men's locker room.

05:29.592 --> 05:31.890
I lost my wedding ring,

05:31.891 --> 05:33.990
and you're making lewd jokes.

05:33.991 --> 05:35.758
I'm sorry, Tom. I'm just
trying to make you laugh.

05:38.091 --> 05:39.924
Why'd I take it off?

05:39.925 --> 05:42.323
I think the better question is,
why do you still have it on?

05:42.324 --> 05:43.558
Because I love my wife.

05:43.559 --> 05:46.524
Well, and ring and no ring
doesn't change that.

05:46.525 --> 05:47.890
Maybe it's a good thing.

05:47.891 --> 05:49.925
That I lost the most important
symbol of my marriage--

05:49.926 --> 05:51.423
How is that a good thing?

05:51.424 --> 05:53.258
Would you ever have stopped
wearing it on your own?

05:55.391 --> 05:59.024
It's brutal, Tom.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.558
But Grace wouldn't have
wanted you to stand still

06:00.559 --> 06:01.858
and not move on.

06:01.859 --> 06:05.057
You don't know what
Grace would have wanted.

06:05.058 --> 06:06.890
She was my wife.

06:09.091 --> 06:12.325
I'd better go.
Uh, maybe it's in the car.

06:15.891 --> 06:18.590
So my parents are leaving
for the weekend at, like, 5:00,

06:18.591 --> 06:20.957
but don't come before 8:00.

06:20.958 --> 06:22.689
I'm afraid my parents
have drafted our neighbors...

06:22.690 --> 06:24.191
the alexanders, to spy on me.

06:24.192 --> 06:26.957
So I'll need the cover
of darkness.

06:26.958 --> 06:28.258
And I'll park
on the other side of the street

06:28.259 --> 06:30.057
three houses down.

06:30.058 --> 06:32.857
I'm excited to see you. I can't
believe it's been three weeks.

06:32.858 --> 06:35.790
And almost two months since...

06:35.791 --> 06:36.858
We did it.

06:36.859 --> 06:38.490
Has it been that long?

06:38.491 --> 06:40.557
I know.

06:40.558 --> 06:42.324
You must be dying for it.

06:42.325 --> 06:45.090
No, it's cool.
Sex isn't everything.

06:45.091 --> 06:47.657
<i>With Maggie's words
ringing in her ear,</i>

06:47.658 --> 06:51.590
<i>mouse couldn't help but wonder
if Seth meant sex with her.</i>

06:51.591 --> 06:55.990
<i>The next day, I was conquering
New territory...</i>

06:55.991 --> 06:59.525
<i>and passing my driver's test
with flying colors.</i>

07:04.991 --> 07:07.557
So the last part
of the physical driving test

07:07.558 --> 07:09.290
is the parallel parking move.

07:09.291 --> 07:13.557
You must place the car
between the marked cones.

07:13.558 --> 07:15.523
I don't want to brag,
but I'm gonna nail this.

07:15.524 --> 07:17.758
If you thought I did a good job
on the 3-Point turn,

07:17.759 --> 07:20.091
you ain't seen nothing yet.
Mm.

07:22.291 --> 07:23.924
Prepare to watch magic.

07:26.891 --> 07:28.757
Really?

07:28.758 --> 07:30.825
What the...

07:37.191 --> 07:39.324
is something the matter?

07:39.325 --> 07:41.625
Are you gonna parallel park
or not?

07:42.825 --> 07:44.057
Oh! Ho ho!

07:44.058 --> 07:45.091
Aah!

07:45.092 --> 07:46.857
Oh, my... god!

07:46.858 --> 07:48.557
Oops.

07:48.558 --> 07:49.790
Bradshaw?

07:49.791 --> 07:52.257
Girl, what the hell
are you doing?

07:52.258 --> 07:54.024
I thought I hit the brakes.
Oh!

07:54.025 --> 07:57.091
She tried to kill us.
She tried to run us over.

07:58.258 --> 07:59.324
You okay?

07:59.325 --> 08:01.224
What happened?

08:01.225 --> 08:04.657
I told you to watch out
for that blind spot.
I don't know.

08:04.658 --> 08:08.324
<i>The problem wasn't the car's
blind spot... But my own.</i>

08:08.325 --> 08:10.857
We should check the car
for damage.

08:10.858 --> 08:13.124
Yeah.

08:13.125 --> 08:15.190
Well, there doesn't seem
to be any...

08:15.191 --> 08:17.058
why don't you head to the car,
and I'll be right there?
Damage to the car.

08:17.059 --> 08:21.057
But I...
no, just head to the car.

08:21.058 --> 08:23.491
Well, that's a relief.
Well, obviously you failed.

08:23.492 --> 08:26.524
I know. I don't--
I don't know what happened.

08:26.525 --> 08:29.190
You can't lose your focus,
Carrie,

08:29.191 --> 08:31.890
ever, no matter
what's going on.

08:31.891 --> 08:36.724
Will you ask the lady if I can
retake the test and when?

08:36.725 --> 08:38.457
Excuse me.
Uh-Huh?

08:38.457 --> 08:40.058
Um...

08:45.758 --> 08:48.757
I... did not want you
to find out this way.

08:48.758 --> 08:49.691
Find out what?

08:49.692 --> 08:52.524
About me and Donna.

08:52.525 --> 08:54.657
There's a you and Donna?

08:54.658 --> 08:57.257
We've been... hanging out.

08:57.258 --> 08:58.257
Since when?

08:58.258 --> 09:01.124
It's been a week or so.

09:01.125 --> 09:04.724
Oh. Seems like it's going
very well from what I could see.

09:04.725 --> 09:06.523
If I'd known you were here,
I wouldn't have--

09:06.524 --> 09:07.923
Had your tongue
down her throat?

09:07.924 --> 09:09.558
Don't feel like you have
to hide anything from me.

09:09.559 --> 09:11.490
I mean, why would I care?

09:11.491 --> 09:13.425
I just thought
it'd be uncool for you

09:13.426 --> 09:14.957
to have it thrown in your face.

09:14.958 --> 09:16.324
Why?

09:16.325 --> 09:18.424
It's cool. I'm cool.

09:18.425 --> 09:19.425
It's been weeks.

09:19.426 --> 09:21.590
Weeks.
Of course you've moved on.

09:21.591 --> 09:23.925
Actually, it would have been
totally pathetic if you hadn't.

09:23.926 --> 09:25.724
I would have felt bad for you

09:25.725 --> 09:29.757
because I've been hanging out
with someone else, too.

09:29.758 --> 09:30.990
Oh.

09:30.991 --> 09:32.590
Yeah.

09:32.591 --> 09:34.224
Well, that's... great.

09:34.225 --> 09:35.825
His name is George Silver.
He's from the city,

09:35.826 --> 09:37.257
as in Manhattan.

09:37.258 --> 09:39.490
His mom's name's Kick.
Uh...

09:39.491 --> 09:40.691
Now if you'll excuse me,

09:40.692 --> 09:43.724
I... I should go call him.

09:43.725 --> 09:46.090
Hi, George. It's Carrie.

09:46.091 --> 09:48.958
I can go to the party after all.

10:03.291 --> 10:06.824
♪ why can't we get together?

10:06.825 --> 10:08.290
You can't wear that one.

10:08.291 --> 10:11.290
Oh, hi. I'm trying to find
something to wear

10:11.291 --> 10:13.357
on my date with George
for his mom's party,

10:13.358 --> 10:14.525
and I'm on my lunch break.

10:14.526 --> 10:18.190
I know. And Kick prefers
the term "Soiree."

10:18.191 --> 10:21.524
Oh. Soiree. Got it.

10:21.525 --> 10:23.291
I've never been to a party
like this.

10:23.292 --> 10:24.990
Kinda nervous.

10:24.991 --> 10:26.058
I'm supposed to wear blue.

10:26.059 --> 10:28.757
Sapphire.
This is navy blue.

10:28.758 --> 10:30.457
Is there a difference?

10:30.458 --> 10:31.990
In Kick Silver's world,
there is.

10:31.991 --> 10:34.957
Let me help you.

10:34.958 --> 10:37.124
It's called the jewel party.

10:37.125 --> 10:39.190
It's one of
the most talked-About events

10:39.191 --> 10:40.123
of the social season.

10:40.124 --> 10:41.425
Each woman is assigned
a color--

10:41.426 --> 10:44.057
Either Ruby, Emerald,
or sapphire,

10:44.058 --> 10:45.291
and the Kick wears white

10:45.292 --> 10:48.724
And covers herself in rubies,
emeralds, and sapphires.

10:48.725 --> 10:51.457
Wow. George didn't tell me.
He just said "Blue."

10:51.458 --> 10:53.390
Well, that's my George--

10:53.391 --> 10:55.591
Like most men, not one
to focus on the fine points.

10:57.925 --> 10:59.525
When Harlan and Kick
were still married,

10:59.526 --> 11:02.324
I had to deal with
every last idiotic detail

11:02.325 --> 11:04.790
that pretentious socialite
thought of.

11:04.791 --> 11:06.824
Her wish, my nightmare.

11:06.825 --> 11:08.390
One year she wanted swans.

11:08.391 --> 11:10.890
They pooped
all over her oriental rug,

11:10.891 --> 11:13.958
and they're mean
sons of bitches.

11:16.759 --> 11:19.625
Try these on. Thanks.

11:21.625 --> 11:24.390
So you've known George
a long time.

11:24.391 --> 11:25.658
Since he was 4.

11:25.659 --> 11:28.757
Poor kid.
He may summer in Ibiza,

11:28.758 --> 11:29.991
but he does not have parents

11:29.992 --> 11:32.057
who know the first thing
about priorities.

11:32.058 --> 11:35.190
He is the rope
in their obscene tug-of-war.

11:35.191 --> 11:36.225
That sounds awful.

11:36.226 --> 11:39.791
So what do you think?

11:40.958 --> 11:42.958
That looks nice on you.

11:46.058 --> 11:48.157
Shows off your eyes.

11:48.158 --> 11:49.090
Thanks.

11:49.091 --> 11:50.557
And I think...

11:51.791 --> 11:54.157
I still have some
fake jewelry from last year.

11:54.158 --> 11:55.758
They gave it out
as party favors--

11:55.759 --> 11:58.724
Rings, a few necklaces.
You can have them.

11:58.725 --> 12:02.824
It'll give it
a little... Sparkle.

12:02.825 --> 12:04.557
Thank you.

12:04.558 --> 12:07.090
Can I ask you something?

12:07.091 --> 12:08.457
Maybe.

12:08.458 --> 12:10.624
Why are you being
so nice to me?

12:10.625 --> 12:13.224
Well, I mean, not nice, but...

12:13.225 --> 12:14.825
Yeah, okay, nice.

12:16.725 --> 12:19.257
I think it's good for George
to hang out with someone

12:19.258 --> 12:21.257
who knows the value
of hard work.

12:21.258 --> 12:23.124
You think I'm a hard worker?

12:23.125 --> 12:25.224
I have to say,
I was pretty sure

12:25.225 --> 12:26.958
you were just gonna be
the entitled kid

12:26.959 --> 12:29.990
of one of Harlan's friends,
but you have surprised me.

12:29.991 --> 12:31.225
Maybe even impressed you?

12:31.226 --> 12:32.458
Don't push it.

12:35.125 --> 12:38.990
<i>It appeared Barbara and I
had entered new territory,</i>

12:38.991 --> 12:41.157
<i>and it was nice.</i>

12:41.158 --> 12:43.390
I can't believe Sebastian
is dating Donna.

12:43.391 --> 12:45.325
I really thought
he was better than that.

12:45.326 --> 12:46.924
What does he even see in her?

12:46.925 --> 12:48.924
Um, her big boobs
and her hot body.

12:48.925 --> 12:50.257
Men do like that.

12:50.258 --> 12:52.790
Maybe that's why Seth
isn't excited about me.

12:52.791 --> 12:54.357
I don't have one of those.

12:54.358 --> 12:57.257
I mean, I have two boobs,
just not a hot body.

12:57.258 --> 12:58.956
Well, some of us
love our girlfriends

12:58.957 --> 13:00.191
for their personalities.

13:00.192 --> 13:02.590
You don't think I have
a hot body?

13:02.591 --> 13:04.558
You think Seth isn't
attracted to me?

13:04.559 --> 13:06.490
Maybe I should just not talk.

13:06.491 --> 13:08.258
I'm just glad Carrie's
at her internship

13:08.259 --> 13:11.390
and has other stuff going on,
like her date with George.

13:11.391 --> 13:13.323
As long as ding dong Donna
doesn't rub it in her face,

13:13.324 --> 13:14.291
she'll be fine.

13:16.958 --> 13:19.290
What are they doing here?

13:19.291 --> 13:20.391
They never come here.

13:20.392 --> 13:21.891
The diner is <i>ours.</i>

13:21.892 --> 13:24.858
Oh. Hey, guys.

13:26.591 --> 13:27.891
Is Carrie not here today
because of me?

13:27.892 --> 13:30.890
I mean, me and Sebastian.

13:30.891 --> 13:32.025
She's obviously having
a hard time

13:32.026 --> 13:34.324
dealing
with the new "It" couple.

13:34.325 --> 13:36.824
I heard she tried
to run them over, right?
She did not.

13:36.825 --> 13:38.089
And Carrie isn't here
because she's too busy

13:38.090 --> 13:40.056
having an awesome time
in manhattan

13:40.057 --> 13:41.458
and can't be bothered
hanging out

13:41.459 --> 13:43.824
with losers at the diner.

13:45.491 --> 13:47.790
Us excluded, of course.

13:47.791 --> 13:49.757
This place is so cute.

13:49.758 --> 13:52.225
I don't know why we don't
hang out here more.
Because This is <i>ourhangout.</i>

13:52.226 --> 13:55.224
I don't think you can claim
a place. That's just childish.

13:55.225 --> 13:57.091
It's ours,
and we're not going anywhere.

13:59.425 --> 14:01.256
Actually,
I have to get back for calculus.

14:01.257 --> 14:02.691
And I've got european history.

14:02.692 --> 14:04.024
Okay, go.

14:04.025 --> 14:06.190
I have study hall.

14:06.191 --> 14:07.258
And I'm not leaving.

14:10.725 --> 14:13.857
<i>While Maggie was protecting
our territory,</i>

14:13.858 --> 14:15.123
<i>my dad was protecting his.</i>

14:15.124 --> 14:16.923
The jeweler looked at me
like I was crazy.

14:16.924 --> 14:18.125
Well, you are, Tommy.

14:18.126 --> 14:20.190
You lost the ring.
Move on.

14:20.191 --> 14:22.557
You know what else he said?

14:22.558 --> 14:24.658
Buy a woman something sparkly,
and you'll get laid?

14:24.659 --> 14:30.124
No. He told me that
Grace lost her ring three times.

14:30.125 --> 14:32.524
I guess she was always
taking it off to garden.

14:32.525 --> 14:34.024
I-I never knew that.

14:34.025 --> 14:35.023
What, that she gardened?

14:35.024 --> 14:36.725
Are you being
purposefully obtuse?

14:36.726 --> 14:38.224
That she lost her ring.

14:38.225 --> 14:40.390
It should make you feel better.

14:40.391 --> 14:42.157
I guess.

14:42.158 --> 14:43.789
You know what should
also make you feel better?

14:43.790 --> 14:46.125
My son is gonna be
wining and dining your daughter.

14:46.126 --> 14:49.224
Oh, George better not be
wining her. She's 16.

14:49.225 --> 14:50.624
You don't have to worry.

14:50.625 --> 14:52.891
Despite having me and that crazy
bitch of an ex-Wife for parents,

14:52.892 --> 14:54.657
George is a great kid.

14:54.658 --> 14:56.025
Doesn't matter
how great George is.

14:56.026 --> 15:00.257
It's just... weird thinking
of my little girl dating.

15:00.258 --> 15:04.490
Yeah. Well, I get it.
I wouldn't want girls,

15:04.491 --> 15:06.358
knowing what Horn dogs
teenage boys are.

15:06.359 --> 15:08.590
Yeah, you're not helping.

15:08.591 --> 15:10.557
Once again.

15:13.091 --> 15:14.757
Can I ask you something?

15:14.758 --> 15:15.825
Sure.

15:17.125 --> 15:19.724
Where did you learn about sex?

15:19.725 --> 15:22.224
Our Fifth Grade
health education class.

15:22.225 --> 15:23.991
I also learned that I would
get hair under my arms.

15:23.992 --> 15:25.790
I was traumatized.

15:25.791 --> 15:27.424
No, I mean, like...

15:27.425 --> 15:30.090
how to have sex.

15:30.091 --> 15:31.324
Oh.

15:31.325 --> 15:33.190
Kinda still learning.

15:33.191 --> 15:34.858
Why, did Maggie say something?
Am I bad?

15:34.859 --> 15:37.257
No. She said you were good.

15:37.258 --> 15:38.290
Really?

15:38.291 --> 15:39.890
That's cool.

15:39.891 --> 15:42.189
'Cause I've been trying
really hard to do it right.

15:42.190 --> 15:43.425
It's kind of exhausting.

15:43.426 --> 15:44.790
Is it supposed to be?

15:44.791 --> 15:46.324
I'm very confused.

15:46.325 --> 15:48.857
I think I'm doing a bad job
with Seth.

15:48.858 --> 15:51.291
The thing is with guys,
we're kinda happy with anything,

15:51.292 --> 15:54.190
as long as it's being,
you know... handled.

15:54.191 --> 15:56.625
That's the thing. I never
know what to do with...

15:58.725 --> 16:00.090
it.

16:00.091 --> 16:01.457
You play golf, right?

16:01.458 --> 16:03.790
Yeah. My parents make me.

16:03.791 --> 16:04.958
Well, you know how you're
supposed to hold the club loose

16:04.959 --> 16:06.424
but with control?

16:06.425 --> 16:07.890
I never can do that.

16:07.891 --> 16:09.258
I always wanna, like,
squeeze it really tight.

16:09.259 --> 16:10.957
I've given myself blisters.

16:10.958 --> 16:12.325
Yeah, okay, that's not good.

16:12.326 --> 16:14.024
Oh, my god.

16:14.025 --> 16:15.590
I'm bad at this.

16:15.591 --> 16:17.390
Really bad.

16:17.391 --> 16:18.625
I need help.

16:19.791 --> 16:21.624
Help me, Walt.

16:21.625 --> 16:23.190
I might have something for you.

16:23.191 --> 16:24.458
Meet me at your house
after school?

16:24.459 --> 16:25.624
Yeah.
Okay.

16:25.625 --> 16:26.891
See you then.

16:29.025 --> 16:31.325
<i>That night, when my father
got off the train,</i>

16:31.326 --> 16:34.924
<i>he was distracted
by his missing wedding ring...</i>

16:34.925 --> 16:36.457
aah!

16:36.458 --> 16:37.990
Oh!
<i>Really distracted.</i>

16:41.891 --> 16:43.724
Are you okay?

16:43.725 --> 16:44.957
Yeah.

16:44.958 --> 16:46.457
Are you sure?
Ooh. Yeah.

16:46.458 --> 16:47.924
Oh, I am so sorry.

16:47.925 --> 16:49.824
It's okay.
No, it's not.

16:49.825 --> 16:51.524
I hit you with my car.

16:51.525 --> 16:53.791
It's... I think it's--It's...
Yeah, let's go sit down.

16:53.792 --> 16:56.858
Okay.
Oh, here. Let me take your bag.
Please. God.

17:00.625 --> 17:01.691
Well?

17:05.425 --> 17:07.424
You look good.

17:07.425 --> 17:10.757
Maybe too many necklaces,
but... what do I know?

17:10.758 --> 17:12.324
I like it like this.

17:12.325 --> 17:13.957
It looks nice.

17:13.958 --> 17:16.690
Now...
If you get nervous

17:16.691 --> 17:18.589
or run out of stuff to say,

17:18.590 --> 17:20.455
just tell Kick that
the canapes are divine

17:20.457 --> 17:21.858
and that the basquiat
in the great room

17:21.858 --> 17:24.156
is so much more spectacular
than the one

17:24.157 --> 17:27.156
in Pat Buckley's penthouse,
and she will love you.

17:27.157 --> 17:29.857
Okay. I have no idea
what you're talking about.

17:29.858 --> 17:31.290
Are those people?

17:31.291 --> 17:34.524
Canape is an hors d'oeuvre.
A Basquiat's a painting.

17:34.525 --> 17:36.757
Oh, boy.
Now I'm officially nervous.

17:36.758 --> 17:39.490
Don't be.

17:39.491 --> 17:40.990
Wow. You look amazing.

17:40.991 --> 17:42.224
So do you.

17:42.225 --> 17:44.490
Why are you in a tuxedo?

17:44.491 --> 17:45.823
Because tonight is formal.

17:45.824 --> 17:47.056
I thought it was cocktail.

17:47.057 --> 17:48.323
It was cocktail last year.

17:48.324 --> 17:49.858
Yeah, but you know my mother.

17:49.859 --> 17:52.224
She likes to up the ante.

17:52.225 --> 17:54.990
This year--Formal.

17:54.991 --> 17:56.290
Did I not say that?
No.

17:56.291 --> 17:58.624
No. You didn't.

17:58.625 --> 18:00.024
I can't go like this.

18:00.025 --> 18:01.757
Why?
You look beautiful.

18:01.758 --> 18:03.790
Because I know
how these things work.

18:03.791 --> 18:06.724
If I show up in this dress,
I will forever be known

18:06.725 --> 18:08.790
as the girl who came
to Kick Silver's soiree

18:08.791 --> 18:10.390
in a knee-length dress.

18:10.391 --> 18:11.790
What are we gonna do?

18:11.791 --> 18:14.490
I don't know.
I don't know.

18:14.491 --> 18:16.790
Um... if you'll excuse me,

18:16.791 --> 18:18.557
I-I need a couple minutes.

18:23.758 --> 18:25.289
Don't know how
you managed that, Carrie.

18:25.290 --> 18:26.958
Well, it's a good thing
Barbara's daughter

18:26.959 --> 18:28.458
went through a tutu phase.

18:36.525 --> 18:37.858
This way.

18:41.158 --> 18:44.490
I don't think we're in
castlebury anymore, toto.

18:44.491 --> 18:47.325
Oh, and look, there's
the great and powerful Oz.

18:48.558 --> 18:50.090
<i>The best thing to do</i>

18:50.091 --> 18:52.290
<i>when entering
unknown territory?</i>

18:52.291 --> 18:54.124
Georgie.
Kick.

18:54.125 --> 18:55.390
Mwah. Mwah.

18:55.391 --> 18:58.957
And I see
you brought your friend.

18:58.958 --> 19:00.525
<i>Smile.</i>

19:05.425 --> 19:06.691
So glad you could make it.

19:06.692 --> 19:11.557
Your dress is fabulous.
Is it Couture?

19:11.558 --> 19:12.857
Haute Couture?

19:12.858 --> 19:14.190
I, uh...

19:14.191 --> 19:15.325
the dress was designed
just for Carrie.

19:15.326 --> 19:16.424
Oh! So it is.

19:16.425 --> 19:18.890
Yes.

19:18.891 --> 19:21.590
Your home is beautiful.
Oh, I'm glad you think so.

19:21.591 --> 19:23.957
George says the artwork
is frightening.

19:23.958 --> 19:26.824
Kick, you had Edvard Munch's
"the scream" in my bedroom.

19:26.825 --> 19:29.424
The pastel version,
but we sold it

19:29.425 --> 19:31.158
when George's psychoanalyst
said it might be the cause

19:31.159 --> 19:33.224
of his nightmares.
I don't think you needed

19:33.225 --> 19:35.457
to share that with her.
I was 10.

19:35.458 --> 19:37.325
I hope you don't mind.
I invited Blythe.

19:37.326 --> 19:39.690
I didn't realize she was back.

19:39.691 --> 19:41.224
Back and more gorgeous
than ever.

19:41.225 --> 19:45.224
She looks positively radiant
after her little vacation.

19:45.225 --> 19:46.890
Blythe is my ex-Girlfriend,

19:46.891 --> 19:49.224
and she's just back from rehab.

19:49.225 --> 19:51.991
Oh, look, there she is now.

19:53.958 --> 19:57.824
<i>Suddenly, I realized
I wasn't in foreign territory.</i>

19:57.825 --> 20:00.691
<i>I was on somebody else's.</i>

20:02.358 --> 20:05.524
<i>Meanwhile, mouse and Walt were
in unchartered territory.</i>

20:06.924 --> 20:08.589
<i>While in this position,</i>

20:08.590 --> 20:10.758
<i>the male participant
Should scissor his legs</i>

20:10.759 --> 20:14.224
<i>in order to increase
the friction.</i>

20:16.758 --> 20:20.424
I don't understand what
I'm even looking at.

20:20.425 --> 20:24.591
Yeah. It took me five viewings
to get my bearings.

20:26.391 --> 20:28.724
That's her knees.

20:28.725 --> 20:31.457
Is that actually
physically possible?

20:31.458 --> 20:32.990
I've perfected it.

20:32.991 --> 20:35.357
Whoa.

20:36.425 --> 20:39.657
No wonder Maggie thinks
you're so good.

20:39.658 --> 20:41.757
I hope Seth
will think that of me.

20:41.758 --> 20:43.224
He will.

20:43.225 --> 20:46.990
At first, things with Maggie
weren't going so well,

20:46.991 --> 20:48.790
but then I got this video,

20:48.791 --> 20:51.790
and I have one satisfied
customer on my hands.

20:51.791 --> 20:54.890
It'll work, I promise.
I hope so.

20:54.891 --> 20:56.625
Seth arrives
in less than an hour.

20:56.626 --> 20:59.057
I have a lot to Cram in
before he gets here.

20:59.058 --> 21:00.624
You'll be great.

21:00.625 --> 21:04.424
<i>Even though mouse had a lot
of ground to cover,</i>

21:04.425 --> 21:06.891
<i>she was sure she could maintain
her overachiever status</i>

21:06.892 --> 21:08.624
<i>when it came to sex.</i>

21:08.625 --> 21:10.824
<i>Meanwhile, Maggie realized</i>

21:10.825 --> 21:12.891
<i>there was simply
too much ground to cover.</i>

21:14.358 --> 21:17.124
I'm sorry.
What are you doing here?

21:17.125 --> 21:19.190
Eating.
Salads.

21:19.191 --> 21:21.090
With the dressing on the side.

21:21.091 --> 21:23.858
I was sitting here
five minutes ago.

21:25.025 --> 21:26.424
Were you?

21:26.425 --> 21:28.291
You threw my purse
and coat on the floor.

21:28.292 --> 21:31.524
Oh. Didn't realize
they were yours.

21:31.525 --> 21:33.257
Why don't you go back
to the mall

21:33.258 --> 21:34.590
where you belong?

21:34.591 --> 21:36.124
I'm bored with the mall,

21:36.125 --> 21:38.124
but you know what
I'm not bored with?

21:38.125 --> 21:39.457
Is Sebastian.

21:39.458 --> 21:41.058
And my man loves
the grilled cheese,

21:41.059 --> 21:43.924
so we're gonna be
hanging here a lot.

21:43.925 --> 21:45.990
Listen up.

21:45.991 --> 21:47.757
You and your gruesome twosome

21:47.758 --> 21:49.524
are not taking the diner.

21:49.525 --> 21:51.057
The diner's ours.

21:51.058 --> 21:52.791
Or maybe you and your friends
should find somewhere else

21:52.792 --> 21:54.825
to have
your lame little convos.

21:56.458 --> 21:57.825
I don't think you know
who you're dealing with.

21:57.826 --> 22:00.490
I have two older brothers,
and I'm not afraid to bite.

22:00.491 --> 22:03.024
So if you'll just get up
and leave quietly,

22:03.025 --> 22:05.090
we can end this right here.

22:05.091 --> 22:06.425
Make me.

22:08.358 --> 22:10.758
I told my father I'm not going
if we don't fly privately.

22:10.759 --> 22:12.756
I don't care if it takes
a few hours longer.

22:12.757 --> 22:14.058
I don't want to have to sit
with the masses.

22:14.059 --> 22:15.924
I wouldn't go anyway.

22:15.925 --> 22:17.958
The weather at thanksgiving
in gstaad can be so iffy.

22:17.959 --> 22:19.458
Sometimes
there's not even snow.

22:19.459 --> 22:21.924
Why do you even care?
You don't ski.

22:21.925 --> 22:24.690
But I love to <i>apres-Ski.</i>

22:24.691 --> 22:28.157
So, Blythe, how was
your stint in Rehab?

22:28.158 --> 22:32.424
George, that's very uncouth
for you to ask that in public.

22:32.425 --> 22:33.858
But I'd be happy
to give you the details

22:33.859 --> 22:36.090
if you wanna go
somewhere private.

22:36.091 --> 22:38.091
Well, I'm not sure Carrie
wants to hear all about

22:38.092 --> 22:40.424
your most recent stay
at Betty Ford.

22:40.425 --> 22:43.257
I'm sorry. I'd forgotten
she was even here.

22:43.258 --> 22:44.456
She hasn't said a word.

22:44.457 --> 22:46.025
I didn't think
you'd be all that interested

22:46.026 --> 22:47.690
in my trip to the D.M.V.

22:47.691 --> 22:49.124
Oh. D.M.V.?

22:49.125 --> 22:51.590
Is that near the D.R.,
the dominican republic?

22:51.591 --> 22:52.925
I think I'm supposed
to go there next week.

22:52.926 --> 22:55.324
Uh, the department
of motor vehicles,

22:55.325 --> 22:56.690
in connecticut.

22:56.691 --> 22:58.291
It's the place where you get
your driver's license.

22:58.292 --> 22:59.724
Oh. I don't drive.

23:00.858 --> 23:01.990
None of us do.

23:01.991 --> 23:03.225
You don't have to in the city.

23:03.226 --> 23:05.924
Seriously? Driving is awesome.

23:05.925 --> 23:08.157
You get to have total control
over your life

23:08.158 --> 23:09.323
and go where you wanna go

23:09.324 --> 23:11.158
and listen to the radio
really loud.

23:11.159 --> 23:13.490
That's why we have drivers.

23:13.491 --> 23:15.325
Oh. Well, you're missing out.

23:16.658 --> 23:18.391
Well, I would love
to learn how to drive,

23:18.392 --> 23:19.924
but only if you teach me.

23:19.925 --> 23:22.825
I think that can be arranged.
Now that would be fun.

23:25.191 --> 23:27.324
What's wrong, Kick?
I need you.

23:27.325 --> 23:29.690
The French ambassador
and secretary Kissinger

23:29.691 --> 23:31.323
are about to come to blows
over whether or not...

23:31.324 --> 23:33.525
Iranian caviar should
still be allowed to be imported.

23:33.526 --> 23:35.857
Well, I'm sure you put
your 2 cents in already.

23:35.858 --> 23:38.291
I would, except the ambassador's
english is terrible

23:38.292 --> 23:41.124
and, well,
your French is flawless.

23:41.125 --> 23:42.757
Can you help me?

23:42.758 --> 23:45.358
Go ahead.
I can handle myself here.

23:46.958 --> 23:48.657
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

23:48.658 --> 23:49.958
Mm-Hmm.

23:53.325 --> 23:55.557
Darling, you're sweet.

23:55.558 --> 23:56.957
Charming even.

23:56.958 --> 23:58.390
But at some point,

23:58.391 --> 24:01.391
George is going to get tired
of slumming and come back to me.

24:02.958 --> 24:06.224
I don't know who you think
you are or who I am,

24:06.225 --> 24:07.824
but I'm from the suburbs.

24:07.825 --> 24:10.258
That doesn't make me a loser.
It just makes me not from here.

24:12.925 --> 24:15.190
Now if you'll excuse me...

24:15.191 --> 24:16.757
oh!

24:16.758 --> 24:18.157
Great.

24:43.191 --> 24:44.490
Hello?

24:44.491 --> 24:47.057
Okay, you sound super excited.

24:47.058 --> 24:48.557
I thought you were Seth.

24:48.558 --> 24:50.324
Oh! I'm interrupting.

24:50.325 --> 24:52.557
He's not here yet.
I'm nervous.

24:52.558 --> 24:54.824
Don't be.
It's gonna be great.

24:54.825 --> 24:56.324
Seth is a lucky guy.

24:56.325 --> 24:58.024
Okay,

24:58.025 --> 25:00.123
why are you calling? I thought
you were supposed to be

25:00.124 --> 25:01.491
at Kick's fabulous soiree?

25:01.492 --> 25:04.057
I am. I'm hiding
in the powder room.

25:04.058 --> 25:06.590
That's what rich socialites call
the bathroom.

25:06.591 --> 25:09.057
There's a phone
in the bathroom? Why?

25:09.058 --> 25:11.557
So they can talk to the help
while they pee?

25:11.558 --> 25:12.790
Gross.

25:12.791 --> 25:15.790
I feel like I'm totally
in a foreign land

25:15.791 --> 25:18.490
and I definitely
don't speak the language.

25:18.491 --> 25:20.490
George calls his mother
by Her first name.

25:20.491 --> 25:23.357
Okay, that is just weird.

25:23.358 --> 25:24.957
So George isn't your guy.

25:24.958 --> 25:28.724
That's the thing.
I thought he could be.

25:28.725 --> 25:30.857
I actually had a moment tonight
where I thought,

25:30.858 --> 25:33.657
hello, George.
Good-Bye, Sebastian.

25:33.658 --> 25:35.557
And then I met his mom.

25:35.558 --> 25:38.190
Who cares what his mom's like?
You're not dating her.

25:38.191 --> 25:41.057
Yeah, tell that to Kick.
And to <i>Blythe.</i>

25:41.058 --> 25:42.724
Wait. Who's Blythe?

25:42.725 --> 25:43.890
His gorgeous,

25:43.891 --> 25:46.724
long-Legged,
shiny-Haired ex-Girlfriend.

25:46.725 --> 25:49.757
I never felt more itty-Bitty
suburban in my entire life.

25:49.758 --> 25:51.390
Enough!

25:51.391 --> 25:53.124
No one in the real world

25:53.125 --> 25:56.357
likes jewel-themed parties
or leggy beauties.

25:56.358 --> 25:59.890
Okay, <i>maybeguys like that,
but not as much as being cool</i>

25:59.891 --> 26:02.157
and smart and pretty.

26:02.158 --> 26:05.524
And George invited you to
this party, not lithe Blythe.

26:05.525 --> 26:07.057
You're right.

26:07.058 --> 26:08.657
I'm always right.

26:10.491 --> 26:12.624
Seth's here.

26:12.625 --> 26:13.990
Oh!

26:13.991 --> 26:15.858
So if you'll excuse me,
I need to go jump my boyfriend,

26:15.859 --> 26:17.857
and I suggest you do the same.

26:17.858 --> 26:19.491
Go get him, tiger.
Aah!

26:29.758 --> 26:31.090
<i>Mouse was hopeful</i>

Mouse...

27:26.558 --> 27:27.690
Wow!

27:27.691 --> 27:29.824
Have I said "wow"?

27:29.825 --> 27:31.890
About ten times.

27:31.891 --> 27:35.790
That last move? I-I-I didn't
even know it was possible.

27:35.791 --> 27:39.657
Expect the impossible
when you're with me.

27:39.658 --> 27:43.524
I have to say I'm--I'm surprised
but I'm also a little relieved.

27:43.525 --> 27:45.290
Was sex that bad with me
before?

27:45.291 --> 27:47.524
No, no, no. It was good.
But this...

27:47.525 --> 27:49.024
I mean, <i>this...</i>

27:49.025 --> 27:52.157
clearly, you've learned
from someone.

27:52.158 --> 27:53.824
Mm.

27:53.825 --> 27:56.290
Well, to be honest...

27:56.291 --> 27:57.691
you don't have to explain.
I--

27:57.692 --> 28:00.524
You had sex with another guy.

28:00.525 --> 28:03.224
And it--It's okay.
I-I feel less guilty.

28:03.225 --> 28:04.489
I was feeling really bad

28:04.490 --> 28:06.025
because I had sex
while we were broken up, too.

28:06.026 --> 28:08.824
You did?

28:08.825 --> 28:10.425
Well, we both did.

28:11.825 --> 28:13.125
Yeah. What a relief.

28:14.358 --> 28:16.657
Well, uh...

28:16.658 --> 28:17.989
now neither of us
have to feel bad

28:17.990 --> 28:19.391
we slept with another person.

28:19.392 --> 28:22.224
Okay, good, 'cause I just was
feeling really awful

28:22.225 --> 28:23.857
that I slept with other people.

28:23.858 --> 28:25.224
People?

28:25.225 --> 28:27.257
I thought we were talking
singular.

28:27.258 --> 28:28.324
Two.

28:28.325 --> 28:31.025
Uh, we--We were broken up,
after all.

28:32.691 --> 28:34.223
Georgie, what are you thinking?

28:34.224 --> 28:35.991
Obviously not
what you're thinking, Kick.

28:35.992 --> 28:38.257
She didn't know
what Couture was.

28:38.258 --> 28:39.891
You loved her dress,
so what's the difference?

28:39.892 --> 28:41.790
I blame this on myself.

28:41.791 --> 28:43.625
It's because
I married your father--

28:43.626 --> 28:45.390
A jew from the bronx.

28:45.391 --> 28:47.358
I thought it would be exciting
to leave my circle,

28:47.359 --> 28:49.424
but... it's not.

28:49.425 --> 28:51.857
It's just hard.

28:51.858 --> 28:54.324
He never understood our world,
what we wanted.

28:54.325 --> 28:56.357
And now I'm in the middle
of a hideous divorce

28:56.358 --> 29:00.590
with an ass of an ex-husband who
doesn't understand how it works.

29:00.591 --> 29:02.058
Save yourself the trouble.

29:04.491 --> 29:05.824
Maybe you're right--

29:05.825 --> 29:07.825
if that's what you think,
then she definitely is.

29:07.826 --> 29:09.590
Thanks for the canapes.

29:09.591 --> 29:10.690
Carrie, wait!

29:10.691 --> 29:12.324
Let her go.
It's for the best.

29:12.325 --> 29:13.725
For who? For you?

29:15.058 --> 29:17.858
I'm going after her.

29:21.158 --> 29:22.656
George, you're not leaving yet,
are you?

29:22.657 --> 29:24.458
We haven't even had
a moment to talk.

29:24.459 --> 29:26.325
Not now, Blythe.

29:36.958 --> 29:39.157
Carrie, wait!
Damn, you can run in heels.

29:39.158 --> 29:41.490
Carrie, stop.
Why?

29:41.491 --> 29:44.290
So I can hear from your mouth
how I don't fit into your world

29:44.291 --> 29:45.790
and how I embarrassed you?

29:45.791 --> 29:47.489
Or are you worried
the bumpkin from Castlebury

29:47.490 --> 29:48.991
can't get herself home
without a limo?

29:48.992 --> 29:51.724
Well, don't worry about me.
I can take care of myself.

29:51.725 --> 29:54.657
And I know you can.
That's why I like you, Carrie.

29:54.658 --> 29:56.557
I don't understand.

29:56.558 --> 29:58.891
And had you waited, I was about
to tell my mom that yeah,

29:58.892 --> 30:01.290
maybe she's right,
that it's Harder.

30:01.291 --> 30:02.790
But I don't care.

30:02.791 --> 30:04.490
I want sometimes real.

30:04.491 --> 30:06.957
Why, when you can
just have it easy

30:06.958 --> 30:09.857
with your cars and your drivers
and your basquiat?

30:09.858 --> 30:12.657
Which, by the way,
isn't spectacular. It's scary.

30:12.658 --> 30:14.758
I know, right?

30:16.691 --> 30:18.057
I don't get this world.

30:18.058 --> 30:19.624
And I live in it,

30:19.625 --> 30:21.657
but sometimes as I'm sitting
at these events,

30:21.658 --> 30:24.324
listening to everyone
chattering on about nothing,

30:24.325 --> 30:27.124
I look around and I think,

30:27.125 --> 30:28.990
how did I get here?

30:30.591 --> 30:33.190
I just wanna move past my life
where it is now

30:33.191 --> 30:35.057
and find something new.

30:35.058 --> 30:36.757
Does that make any sense?

30:36.758 --> 30:39.557
<i>That's when I realized we were
both so in our own world,</i>

30:39.558 --> 30:42.824
<i>we hadn't noticed we were
standing on common ground.</i>

30:42.825 --> 30:44.324
It does.

30:44.325 --> 30:46.557
<i>Often that ground felt
a little shaky,</i>

30:46.558 --> 30:49.591
<i>but it was really nice to share
those fears with someone else.</i>

30:53.291 --> 30:55.324
I could've taken a cab.

30:55.325 --> 30:57.556
You did not have to drive me
home from the train station.

30:57.557 --> 30:59.391
Oh, well,
it's the least I could do

30:59.392 --> 31:03.357
after hitting you with my car.

31:03.358 --> 31:04.790
So this is your home.

31:04.791 --> 31:06.357
Actually, I live in the city.

31:06.358 --> 31:08.524
I'm just visiting my mom
for the weekend.

31:08.525 --> 31:10.790
Oh. That gives me hope.

31:10.791 --> 31:13.657
I have a feeling that my oldest
is gonna wind up in manhattan,

31:13.658 --> 31:17.824
and, uh, I hope she wants
to come back and visit me.

31:17.825 --> 31:20.290
I didn't realize you had kids.

31:20.291 --> 31:22.057
Two girls.

31:22.058 --> 31:24.091
So you're married?

31:29.658 --> 31:31.225
Uh, no.

31:32.991 --> 31:34.791
No, not anymore.

31:37.691 --> 31:40.024
Maybe we should
exchange numbers.

31:40.025 --> 31:43.157
So you can track me down
if you need to Sue me?

31:43.158 --> 31:46.258
Or so you could
ask me out on a date.

31:47.791 --> 31:48.891
Oh.

31:52.158 --> 31:55.058
<i>Even though My dad wasn't ready
to date...</i>

31:57.991 --> 32:00.291
<i>he now knew
he was ready to move on.</i>

32:04.825 --> 32:06.424
I knocked you on your ass.

32:06.425 --> 32:09.224
That's because you have
a really <i>bigbutt.</i>

32:09.225 --> 32:12.824
Admit defeat.
I'm happy to leave this table
but I'm not leaving this diner.

32:12.825 --> 32:14.791
Why?
So you can torture Carrie?

32:14.792 --> 32:16.857
You already got the guy.
Isn't that enough?

32:16.858 --> 32:18.658
Not for me.
Well, what do you want?

32:18.659 --> 32:21.458
- World domination?
- It's a diner.

32:24.291 --> 32:26.058
Hi.

32:27.291 --> 32:29.390
What's going on here?

32:29.391 --> 32:31.125
Uh, nothing.
I saved you a seat.

32:35.958 --> 32:37.624
Hope you're happy.

32:37.625 --> 32:38.790
About what?

32:38.791 --> 32:40.957
Like you don't know.

32:40.958 --> 32:43.090
The diner.
This is <i>ourplace.</i>

32:43.091 --> 32:45.957
We've been coming here
since we were kids.

32:45.958 --> 32:47.425
This is Carrie's safe place.

32:47.426 --> 32:48.858
I didn't know.

32:51.025 --> 32:52.725
She sure did.

32:55.558 --> 32:59.791
Uh, wait.
Just give us a second, okay?

33:02.391 --> 33:04.657
What are you doing?

33:04.658 --> 33:07.724
What?
I like their grilled cheese.

33:07.725 --> 33:10.957
You're better than this. Am I?

33:10.958 --> 33:13.157
You don't have to do this.
I like you,

33:13.158 --> 33:15.891
not because you're a bitch.
In spite of it.

33:17.525 --> 33:19.591
You like me?

33:21.291 --> 33:23.625
Nobody's ever called me a bitch
before.

33:25.191 --> 33:27.024
At least to my face.

33:27.025 --> 33:28.924
I like it.

33:28.925 --> 33:30.525
So can we get out of here?

33:39.091 --> 33:40.191
The place is all yours.

33:40.192 --> 33:41.858
Thanks.

33:47.192 --> 33:49.824
<i>Maggie might've won
our territory,</i>

33:49.825 --> 33:52.757
<i>but she realized
I had lost the war.</i>

33:52.758 --> 33:56.524
You wanna go again?

33:56.525 --> 33:58.890
I guess.

33:58.891 --> 34:01.490
We don't have to.

34:01.491 --> 34:03.557
Because you don't think
I'm good?

34:03.558 --> 34:04.990
Huh?

34:04.991 --> 34:07.690
Because of that other guy,
now you don't think I'm good.

34:07.691 --> 34:08.856
I didn't say that.

34:08.857 --> 34:10.322
You think he's better than me.

34:10.324 --> 34:11.989
Why? Is it 'cause
he's taller than me?

34:11.989 --> 34:13.690
He couldn't be. I'm--I'm tall.
And I'm in college. Is he?

34:13.692 --> 34:15.989
Does he go to your high school?

34:15.991 --> 34:18.157
He's just a regular person.

34:18.158 --> 34:20.391
I thought you said you didn't
care I was with someone.

34:20.391 --> 34:22.090
Wait, are you still with him?

34:22.091 --> 34:24.924
You're still with him,
aren't you?

34:24.925 --> 34:28.024
Okay, Seth, maybe this
has gone too far.

34:28.025 --> 34:29.324
I... I--

34:29.324 --> 34:31.657
I can't believe
you slept with someone else.

34:31.658 --> 34:34.556
Why? You did.
Yeah, but it's different.

34:34.558 --> 34:36.590
Really? Why?
Because I'm a guy.

34:36.591 --> 34:39.590
All right, Buster, this is such
a ridiculous double standard.

34:39.591 --> 34:41.591
So if you sleep with a bunch
of girls, you're cool.

34:41.592 --> 34:44.257
But if I do, I'm a slut?

34:45.757 --> 34:49.056
Yes, I slept with someone else,

34:49.058 --> 34:50.257
and it was great

34:50.259 --> 34:53.424
and he taught me
lots and lots of stuff.

34:53.425 --> 34:54.989
And you just better
deal with it.

34:54.991 --> 34:56.556
I can't, mouse. Okay?
I-I can't.

34:56.558 --> 34:58.690
I'm just... jealous, okay?

34:58.691 --> 35:01.257
So I-I can't take it.
I--So just...

35:01.258 --> 35:02.690
tell me his name, okay?

35:02.691 --> 35:03.856
If you don't, I'm just gonna
die of jealousy.

35:03.857 --> 35:05.025
Okay. fine.

35:05.026 --> 35:07.924
If I tell you his name,
will you just stop?

35:07.925 --> 35:09.825
I need to know
you're going to calm down.

35:09.826 --> 35:11.957
Yes. I-I promise. Just...

35:11.958 --> 35:13.324
tell me.

35:13.325 --> 35:15.790
The guy who taught me all this,

35:15.791 --> 35:17.691
his name's...

35:19.291 --> 35:20.724
Walt.

35:20.725 --> 35:23.857
Okay, can we just end this now?

35:23.858 --> 35:26.025
If I ever meet this Walt,
I'm gonna bash his face in.

35:27.591 --> 35:29.824
That did not go as I had hoped.

35:32.758 --> 35:36.224
George, where have you been?
You just missed my toast.

35:36.225 --> 35:38.525
Mom, I know in your universe
it's always about you,

35:38.526 --> 35:42.524
But just once, can you just stop
and think about someone else?

35:42.525 --> 35:43.725
But tonight's my big night.

35:43.726 --> 35:46.223
And you should enjoy it.
But Carrie and I are going.

35:46.224 --> 35:47.391
You're gonna leave me
all alone?

35:47.392 --> 35:49.389
With 50 of
your closest confidants.

35:49.390 --> 35:50.623
George, we don't have to go.

35:50.624 --> 35:51.889
You're lovely, Carrie,

35:51.890 --> 35:53.056
and I'm sure it's hard for you
to understand.

35:53.057 --> 35:54.958
You're not all alone
in the world.

35:54.959 --> 35:57.724
My jackass ex-husband dumped me.

35:57.725 --> 36:00.157
You know, he left right before
the A.B.T. Gala.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.290
The biggest social event
of the year.

36:02.291 --> 36:04.057
And now all I have is George.

36:04.058 --> 36:05.790
I can't lose him.

36:08.958 --> 36:11.358
George, why don't you go
get your mother a tissue

36:11.359 --> 36:13.024
and your coat?

36:13.025 --> 36:14.458
I can take care of your mom.

36:20.825 --> 36:22.991
You don't have to keep crying
if you don't want.

36:24.325 --> 36:27.824
I know that was
all for George's benefit.

36:27.825 --> 36:30.624
I have a dad.
I know it works.

36:30.625 --> 36:33.024
It is effective.

36:33.025 --> 36:34.857
And let me be clear.

36:34.858 --> 36:35.958
You need to back off.

36:35.959 --> 36:38.224
I don't have anyone in my life
but George.

36:38.225 --> 36:39.757
I'm alone.

36:39.758 --> 36:42.924
I understand about
being alone in the world.

36:42.925 --> 36:45.224
I lost my mom this past year
to cancer.

36:45.225 --> 36:47.957
And it sucks,

36:47.958 --> 36:49.391
but I don't spend every day

36:49.392 --> 36:52.324
trying to make people
feel sorry for me.

36:52.325 --> 36:55.290
I just keep living my life.

36:55.291 --> 36:56.558
You're Carrie Bradshaw.

36:56.559 --> 36:58.357
Yes, that's me.

36:58.358 --> 37:00.158
George didn't tell me
your last name.

37:00.159 --> 37:03.157
I don't know how I didn't
see it. You're just like her.

37:03.158 --> 37:04.924
I can't believe
I didn't realize

37:04.925 --> 37:07.324
you're--
You're Grace's daughter.

37:07.325 --> 37:09.357
You knew my mom?

37:18.625 --> 37:19.956
Your parents lived in the city
when they were first married.

37:19.957 --> 37:21.891
Your father and Harlan worked
at the same law firm.

37:21.892 --> 37:23.790
We hung out all the time.

37:23.791 --> 37:26.324
Those were wonderful days.

37:26.325 --> 37:28.490
I can't envision my mom here.

37:28.491 --> 37:31.490
She loved her garden
and driving her car.

37:31.491 --> 37:34.690
Your mom left Kicking
and screaming.

37:34.691 --> 37:35.791
She loved it here--

37:35.792 --> 37:38.257
the energy, the crazy people.

37:38.258 --> 37:39.790
Me being one of them.

37:39.791 --> 37:42.790
Your mom was fun.

37:42.791 --> 37:44.058
And good for me.

37:44.059 --> 37:46.724
Although she didn't appreciate
this world

37:46.725 --> 37:48.524
as much as she should have.

37:48.525 --> 37:50.158
Can't imagine why.

37:51.925 --> 37:54.024
So why'd they decide to move?

37:54.025 --> 37:56.825
Your father didn't think this
was a place to raise a family.

37:58.125 --> 38:00.657
Your mother cried
her last night here.

38:00.658 --> 38:04.024
I got her drunk.

38:04.025 --> 38:07.124
So why'd she agree to go
if she didn't want to?

38:07.125 --> 38:10.590
She knew at the end of the day,
it was the right choice for her,

38:10.591 --> 38:13.290
and for the family she wanted.

38:13.291 --> 38:17.857
Grace always used to say,
"sometimes Change is good."

38:17.858 --> 38:20.757
I thought she was crazy.

38:20.758 --> 38:23.791
I always wanted everything
to stay the same.

38:25.325 --> 38:28.025
Of course, it never does.

38:35.525 --> 38:39.225
Your mom used to wear a flower
in her lapel.

38:40.725 --> 38:42.458
She smelled like spring.

38:44.058 --> 38:45.590
Thank you.

38:45.591 --> 38:47.990
For what?

38:47.991 --> 38:50.257
For giving me
a piece of my mom.

38:54.991 --> 38:56.957
Am I interrupting?

38:56.958 --> 38:58.357
Not at all.

38:58.358 --> 39:00.757
You two should get going.

39:00.758 --> 39:02.858
The night's still young.

39:07.291 --> 39:11.490
<i>When we think about entering
new, unchartered territory,</i>

39:11.491 --> 39:13.791
<i>it always comes with the idea
that we forge ahead.</i>

39:13.792 --> 39:17.157
<i>And that's true to some degree.</i>

39:17.158 --> 39:18.824
<i>But often to forge ahead,</i>

39:18.825 --> 39:20.525
<i>we have to look back
to understand</i>

39:20.526 --> 39:22.090
<i>what we're leaving behind.</i>

39:23.457 --> 39:24.925
<i>And it can be scary
because behind us,</i>

39:24.926 --> 39:27.390
<i>there are often blind spots...</i>

39:27.391 --> 39:29.957
♪ some folks

What did you say
your name was?
Um...

40:14.326 --> 40:17.157
Walt.
Walt? You're the guy.

40:17.158 --> 40:19.224
This is the guy.
This is the guy?

40:19.225 --> 40:20.325
I'm gonna kick your ass!

40:20.326 --> 40:21.890
Whoa!
Okay, so what's going on?

40:21.891 --> 40:23.689
'cause I can't take
any more drama at this diner.

40:23.690 --> 40:25.389
I don't want to fight you.

40:25.390 --> 40:26.591
Oh, you're afraid?
Yeah, sorry should be.

40:26.592 --> 40:27.990
Guess what, everybody.

40:27.991 --> 40:30.624
Is everything all right?
Um, no, but it will be.

40:30.625 --> 40:32.957
Okay. Stop. Seth, stop!

40:32.958 --> 40:35.257
I didn't sleep with Walt.
I lied, all right?

40:35.258 --> 40:37.924
I watched a how-to tape
with Walt,

40:37.925 --> 40:40.757
but I was too mortified
to admit it

40:40.758 --> 40:42.824
after you told me
you slept with other girls.

40:42.825 --> 40:46.490
So you...
didn't sleep with Walt?

40:46.491 --> 40:49.590
Um, hi. He's my boyfriend.

40:49.591 --> 40:51.058
Who you probably now think
is a huge loser

40:51.059 --> 40:54.190
for needing to watch some tape
to show me how to have sex.

40:54.191 --> 40:57.191
I think it's sweet.
You wanted to please me.

40:59.225 --> 41:02.157
So you haven't slept
with anybody else?

41:02.158 --> 41:05.025
No.

41:06.425 --> 41:09.690
But if I had, you would need
to be cool with it.

41:09.691 --> 41:12.424
So I'm okay with the fact
that you did.

41:12.425 --> 41:15.590
No double standards, okay?

41:15.591 --> 41:17.057
Totally.

41:17.058 --> 41:19.057
Totally. I'm sorry.
I've been a total ass.

41:19.058 --> 41:22.025
Yes, you have.

41:29.825 --> 41:32.724
Well, apparently a lot happened
while I was in the city.

41:32.725 --> 41:34.990
How'd it go?

41:34.991 --> 41:36.291
Actually, it went pretty great.

41:36.292 --> 41:38.757
- And so was today.
- Got my license!

41:38.758 --> 41:39.857
Aah!
Hey!

41:39.858 --> 41:41.590
Yeah!

41:41.591 --> 41:43.124
Congratulations!
