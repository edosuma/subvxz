17:10.730 --> 17:12.690
You see the rear?

17:12.690 --> 17:14.490
Ah, [bleep]

17:14.500 --> 17:17.730
just when we thought things
couldn't get worse,

17:17.730 --> 17:20.000
we had a rainstorm
quickly moving in.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.770
We thought
we'd have to scrap the race,

17:22.770 --> 17:24.740
but both cars made it out
on the track.

17:24.740 --> 17:26.440
All right, boys.
Have a good trip.

17:26.440 --> 17:27.870
The race was on.

17:27.880 --> 17:32.410
-Yeah!
-Get in there.

17:32.410 --> 17:34.650
-Go, go, go!
-Go, go, go!

17:34.650 --> 17:37.050
-Oh, he passed him.
-Shoot.

17:38.450 --> 17:39.820
He's picking up right here.
Come on, man.

17:39.820 --> 17:41.290
Get up in there, and get it.

17:41.290 --> 17:42.520
Come on.
-Come on, get it.

17:42.520 --> 17:45.290
There you go.

17:45.290 --> 17:49.060
That's what I'm talking about!
Whoo!

17:49.060 --> 17:52.200
[ cheers and applause ]

17:52.200 --> 17:54.830
good job, guys!
Whoo!

17:54.840 --> 17:57.900
And it definitely lived up
to its billing.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.640
-Cheers, guys!
-Whoo!

18:00.640 --> 18:03.040
[ laughter ]

18:03.040 --> 18:05.110
you know, watching kurt busch
beat joey logano

18:05.110 --> 18:06.780
in one of the cars
that we built

18:06.780 --> 18:08.580
was definitely
a professional highlight.

18:08.580 --> 18:10.250
Yeah, but do you know
the moral of the story?

18:10.250 --> 18:12.320
Yeah, build a car
for kurt busch ever year.

18:12.320 --> 18:15.320
No, if you want to be a winner,
don't be a loser.

18:15.320 --> 18:16.860
Speaking of which, if you're
just catching up with us,

18:16.860 --> 18:18.990
we had a little competition
called the gas monkey games,

18:18.990 --> 18:20.630
and it was pretty interesting.

18:20.630 --> 18:22.100
So much so,
that discovery aired it

18:22.100 --> 18:23.460
all over the world,
and now we're going to show it

18:23.470 --> 18:24.800
to you here
in the united states.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.800
So roll that tape.

18:26.800 --> 18:29.070
Welcome back to the 86th
annual gas monkey games.

18:29.070 --> 18:31.270
Now, the doughnut competition
was a fail for the misfits

18:31.270 --> 18:32.610
because tom ate them all.

18:32.610 --> 18:34.970
Do you know how much gas tom
has after he's eaten

18:34.980 --> 18:37.580
an entire box of doughnuts?

18:37.580 --> 18:40.510
Happy to say I don't, christie,
and next up is the tire discus.

18:40.520 --> 18:41.680
Let's go straight to the action.

18:41.680 --> 18:44.020
50 bucks if you
throw it on tom.

18:45.820 --> 18:47.020
Whoo!

18:47.020 --> 18:48.350
Richard: Oh, that's going to be
hard to beat.

18:48.360 --> 18:51.020
But next up for gas monkey
is jeremy cheatham.

18:52.930 --> 18:55.430
-Oh.

18:55.430 --> 18:58.160
-Whoa, christie. I just heard
a crash. What happened?

18:58.170 --> 19:00.800
Man #2: Disqualification for
breaking richard's window.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.700
Richard going to have
your ass!

19:02.700 --> 19:04.700
And that'll be coming
out of your paycheck.

19:04.710 --> 19:06.740
[ laughs ]

19:06.740 --> 19:08.440
I think
I'm going to be sick.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.340
Oh, come on.
Tom is not<i> that</i> disgusting.

19:10.350 --> 19:11.640
All: Yes, he is.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.710
No, I mean I still owe you
for that window.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.650
Don't worry, man.
That's what insurance is for.

19:15.650 --> 19:18.650
Oh, we have insurance
because I got some spots

19:18.650 --> 19:20.020
that look like
mike coy painted them.

19:20.020 --> 19:21.120
I need to go get those
checked out,

19:21.120 --> 19:22.560
but the doctor is
way too expensive.

19:22.560 --> 19:25.460
Not that kind of insurance,
property insurance.

19:25.460 --> 19:27.430
You're on your own
with mike coy spots.

19:27.430 --> 19:28.690
Hang tight, everyone.

19:28.700 --> 19:30.130
There's more gas monkey games
coming up

19:30.130 --> 19:34.000
including a little thing
we like to call human bowling.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.040
Narrator:
Coming up on "fast n' loud"...

19:36.040 --> 19:37.440
When's this thing
going to be done?

19:37.440 --> 19:39.410
...We visit some of last
season's toughest builds.

19:39.410 --> 19:40.610
When I walked in,
I wanted to say,

19:40.610 --> 19:42.070
"what the [bleep] was that?"

19:42.080 --> 19:44.610
narrator:
And the monkey games heat up.

19:44.610 --> 19:47.350
-Ugh.
-[ laughs ]

19:47.350 --> 19:48.450
sweet, baby [bleep].

19:48.450 --> 19:49.980
Ugh!

19:49.980 --> 19:50.820
[ groans ]

19:57.660 --> 19:59.460
richard: What's up, guys?
Where are the guys?

19:59.460 --> 20:01.190
Hurry. Come on.
Get in. Get in.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.700
-Let's go.
-Ah!

20:04.700 --> 20:06.830
[ laughs ]

20:06.830 --> 20:08.400
come on, man!

20:08.400 --> 20:11.500
[ tires screeching ]

20:12.670 --> 20:14.040
[ laughter ]

20:14.040 --> 20:16.040
all right.
Get out of the car.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.940
Welcome back to the monkey trap.
We're taking a look back

20:17.950 --> 20:19.680
at some of the best moments
of "fast n' loud"

20:19.680 --> 20:21.910
before we launch into
our brand-new season.

20:21.920 --> 20:23.350
After building hundreds of cars,

20:23.350 --> 20:24.820
I'm always looking for ways
to challenge the guys

20:24.820 --> 20:28.050
to build better
and bigger, literally.

20:28.060 --> 20:31.220
Mom, the ice cream man
is coming!

20:31.230 --> 20:33.830
We picked up
an old '73 chevy p30 step van

20:33.830 --> 20:35.490
on the interwebs for 4 grand.

20:35.500 --> 20:36.700
-Oh, boy.
-Err.

20:36.700 --> 20:38.230
Are you
delivering something?

20:38.230 --> 20:40.600
A lot of people are hot rodding
step vans these days,

20:40.600 --> 20:43.600
but we wanted to kick it up
a few notches gas monkey-style.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.970
I think we should drop
a fuel-injected zz6 in here.

20:45.970 --> 20:48.570
And drop it all the way
to the ground.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.640
But in order to get a big truck
like this lowered...

20:50.650 --> 20:52.140
No turning back now.

20:52.150 --> 20:53.210
...The monkeys had
to z the frame

20:53.210 --> 20:54.910
before we could do
anything else.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.080
You know
why they call it a z?

20:56.080 --> 20:58.990
Because it goes like this,

20:58.990 --> 21:01.650
so this is where
the frame used to be.

21:01.660 --> 21:04.720
Now this whole section where
the wheels are just got

21:04.730 --> 21:06.160
raised up in the body.

21:06.160 --> 21:08.390
Richard:
Now, what no one tells you
about vehicles two-times

21:08.400 --> 21:09.960
the size
of what we normally build

21:09.960 --> 21:13.000
is that they're twice
the pain in the ass.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.400
We're clearly not going
to make our notch cover.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.000
When's this thing
going to be done?

21:17.010 --> 21:18.500
It's, like, a giant --
like, we're doing a house.

21:18.510 --> 21:20.040
It's basically flat.

21:20.040 --> 21:22.480
-Ugh!
-Hold on.

21:22.480 --> 21:24.940
That sucks.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.510
And here's the thing
about problems,

21:26.510 --> 21:29.980
if we let them stop us,
well, we'd never build any cars.

21:29.980 --> 21:32.350
In the end, we got this
lowered badass step van.

21:32.350 --> 21:34.790
Ah!
This looks so good, man.

21:34.790 --> 21:38.190
The monkeys really crushed it.

21:38.190 --> 21:39.790
Normally,
when we start our builds,

21:39.790 --> 21:42.130
there's no buyer lined up,
but occasionally someone stops

21:42.130 --> 21:43.830
by wanting something so custom

21:43.830 --> 21:45.800
that we're the team to do it,
and you don't want to let

21:45.800 --> 21:47.830
an opportunity
like that pass you by.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.370
We'd like for you to do
a project for us.

21:49.370 --> 21:51.670
Here's the thing, we don't need
to see the plans,

21:51.670 --> 21:53.310
but we want to see the car

21:53.310 --> 21:54.840
before we make the deal
at the end.

21:54.840 --> 21:56.610
I'll take that chance.
I'm a gambling guy.

21:56.610 --> 21:58.180
The folks from shiner brewery
were looking for

21:58.180 --> 21:59.710
a promo vehicle,
and, well, they came

21:59.710 --> 22:00.980
looking in the right place.

22:00.980 --> 22:02.250
$150,000
plus some beer.

22:02.250 --> 22:04.850
Done.
-There you go. Cool.

22:04.850 --> 22:06.920
So it was 150 grand on the line,
plus a case of beer,

22:06.920 --> 22:09.160
and I decided not to tell
the monkeys because if I did,

22:09.160 --> 22:11.120
they might get ahead of
themselves and start bragging,

22:11.130 --> 22:14.090
and, well, it might not
come together like I like it.

22:14.100 --> 22:15.560
You know what's tough
about that, though,

22:15.560 --> 22:17.460
is building a truck
and not knowing what it is.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.670
Coy: So this build started
like any other.

22:19.670 --> 22:20.830
How's the suspension
on it?

22:20.840 --> 22:23.800
-Give it a whirl.
-Oh, my -- hey!

22:23.810 --> 22:26.540
I said I wanted to save
the chassis if we could!

22:26.540 --> 22:29.080
We're testing it!

22:29.080 --> 22:30.780
Coy: We tore the truck down.
Parts came in.

22:30.780 --> 22:32.040
This will decimate all.

22:32.050 --> 22:33.380
Bring it down,
try not to kill anybody,

22:33.380 --> 22:34.710
and don't break
the truck in half.

22:34.720 --> 22:36.850
Well, I don't care about
killing anybody.

22:36.850 --> 22:39.520
Things were going smooth until
it came time to install the bed.

22:39.520 --> 22:40.920
Yeah, our wheels
aren't going to fit.

22:40.920 --> 22:42.220
They're not going
to fit at all.

22:42.220 --> 22:43.790
It turns out the axle
we installed

22:43.790 --> 22:46.330
was meant for a different
style truck and didn't fit.

22:46.330 --> 22:47.690
Oh, [bleep]

22:47.700 --> 22:49.400
so instead of waiting
for a new axle to arrive...

22:49.400 --> 22:51.560
-Do we got to tub this?
-Yep.

22:51.570 --> 22:55.200
...Jeremy got to work tubbing
the rear wheel well

22:55.200 --> 22:58.740
which involved
cutting them out completely

22:58.740 --> 22:59.910
and splitting them
down the middle

22:59.910 --> 23:02.810
so they could be expanded.

23:02.810 --> 23:04.440
Once we had that under control,

23:04.450 --> 23:06.650
richard threw us
a big curveball.

23:06.650 --> 23:09.920
I do not understand
what this is.

23:09.920 --> 23:11.080
Tony.

23:11.090 --> 23:12.180
Richard had a five-color
paint scheme

23:12.190 --> 23:13.650
that nobody could figure out.

23:13.650 --> 23:15.220
He had me do that.
-Okay.

23:15.220 --> 23:17.720
He had me do that, this, this.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.590
It gets better.

23:19.590 --> 23:21.930
You want all five of those
colors on this truck?

23:21.930 --> 23:23.330
You don't know
until you try, brother.

23:23.330 --> 23:25.060
Richard:
Hey, those are shiner's colors.

23:25.070 --> 23:27.730
Well, yeah.
It makes sense<i> now.</i>

23:27.740 --> 23:29.970
You ever going to tell us
why we're doing all this?

23:29.970 --> 23:32.270
I know. I know it looks weird,
but trust me.

23:32.270 --> 23:33.510
When it all comes together,
it's going to look great.

23:33.510 --> 23:34.540
Come on, guys.

23:34.540 --> 23:35.640
Would it have really made
a difference

23:35.640 --> 23:36.740
if you knew
who the truck was for?

23:36.740 --> 23:37.940
Yeah, dude.

23:37.950 --> 23:39.650
It would have made
a huge difference.

23:39.650 --> 23:42.420
Richard:
Anyway, the shiner guys loved
the truck to the tune of 150 gs

23:42.420 --> 23:44.320
so get over it, monkeys.

23:44.320 --> 23:45.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:45.490 --> 23:46.990
Fine, but sometimes
it's better

23:46.990 --> 23:48.850
when the decision-making process
is left out of our hands.

23:48.860 --> 23:51.020
Ooh, I'm going to
remember that.

23:51.030 --> 23:52.390
Let's check out the car.

23:52.390 --> 23:54.060
I want to build it.
-What are you thinking?

23:54.060 --> 23:55.830
I don't want to get all
into fabrication on this one.

23:55.830 --> 23:58.260
I think we just give it
a little updated style.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.400
Yeah, richard's plan would
have been all well and good

24:00.400 --> 24:03.400
if the car was half as good
as he thought it was.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.240
What's this doing in here?
This is our new build.

24:05.240 --> 24:07.410
Richard doesn't want to do
any fabrication whatsoever.

24:07.410 --> 24:08.810
I'm sorry?

24:08.810 --> 24:12.850
♪

24:12.850 --> 24:15.650
oh, my god, dude.
Bad, bad, bad.

24:15.650 --> 24:18.580
That's all bondo covering
the dents and then the crease.

24:18.590 --> 24:19.790
It's hammered dog crap.
That's what it is.

24:19.790 --> 24:21.320
-It's pretty bad.
-It is.

24:21.320 --> 24:22.960
Richard: Whoa.
You know what they say,

24:22.960 --> 24:24.860
don't go looking for problems
if you don't want to find them.

24:24.860 --> 24:28.660
This is by far the worst damage
we've had on a panel

24:28.660 --> 24:31.060
since we worked here.

24:31.070 --> 24:33.100
Richard: To add insult to
injury, replacement panels

24:33.100 --> 24:35.200
for the galaxie are,
well, they're unobtainium.

24:35.200 --> 24:38.340
Take it off. Cut it off
and beat out the dents.

24:38.340 --> 24:40.670
So the monkeys were stuck having
to fix what we already had.

24:40.680 --> 24:41.840
There it is.

24:41.840 --> 24:44.180
And the only way to do that...

24:44.180 --> 24:45.380
Let's go back
the other way.

24:45.380 --> 24:47.180
...Is a slow, tedious process
of rolling

24:47.180 --> 24:50.750
and pounding
out all the dents.

24:50.750 --> 24:53.020
-Oh, wait, wait, wait.
-Oh.

24:53.020 --> 24:55.290
All right.
Weld it back on.

24:57.990 --> 24:59.730
But the real takeaway here is
you wouldn't have found

24:59.730 --> 25:01.160
any of that
if you'd have listened to me,

25:01.160 --> 25:02.600
but that door swings both ways.

25:02.600 --> 25:04.030
It's important to listen
to you guys sometimes

25:04.030 --> 25:05.500
because,
believe it or not,

32:51.130 --> 32:52.600
He's put us
in a bad position.

32:52.600 --> 32:54.070
Well, a lot of things have
put us in a bad position.

32:54.070 --> 32:55.400
We didn't give you enough time.
I don't like it.

32:55.400 --> 32:58.470
You don't like it,
but let's just do it.

32:58.470 --> 33:00.210
How much time
do we have?

33:00.210 --> 33:02.070
Not enough, but we have
no options right now.

33:02.080 --> 33:03.240
Well, here's what's
going to happen.

33:03.240 --> 33:04.440
Y'all are going to throw it
to me

33:04.450 --> 33:05.880
with no time to do
what I got to do.

33:05.880 --> 33:07.010
Since none of us ever come
over there to help you.

33:07.010 --> 33:08.080
You've helped once.

33:08.080 --> 33:10.550
-That's a [bleep] lie.
-Twice, maybe.

33:10.550 --> 33:11.950
[bleep] lie.
We know our time line.

33:11.950 --> 33:13.220
We know we're behind,
so we're doing the best

33:13.220 --> 33:14.590
with the situation we have.

33:14.590 --> 33:15.620
Richard: You should have been
in the booth days ago.

33:15.620 --> 33:16.790
Yeah.

33:16.790 --> 33:18.260
All right, I'm going to do it
this last time.

33:18.260 --> 33:20.260
I know. That's what you said
10 times ago.

33:20.260 --> 33:22.390
No, seriously, for real.
This last time --

33:22.400 --> 33:23.900
-I know. Okay.
-All right.

33:23.900 --> 33:26.130
-You're right.
-I know.

33:27.670 --> 33:30.070
Man, my freaking arm feels like
it's about to fall off.

33:30.070 --> 33:32.170
Why don't you just
pull a chair up, jason?

33:32.170 --> 33:33.610
Put your feet up, buddy.

33:33.610 --> 33:35.270
I'm concerned neither one
of them look happy.

33:37.510 --> 33:40.210
And things really did boil over
in one of the most tense moments

33:40.210 --> 33:41.880
we've ever had here
at the garage.

33:41.880 --> 33:44.050
When it comes over
to the body shop,

33:44.050 --> 33:45.380
I'm going to take
as long as I need

33:45.390 --> 33:46.890
to get my job done
correctly.

33:46.890 --> 33:48.420
No, that's not
how it works.

33:48.420 --> 33:49.960
That's how it works
over here.

33:49.960 --> 33:51.420
This time, it's going to work
that way over there.

33:51.430 --> 33:53.260
Yeah, well,
I don't agree.

33:53.260 --> 33:54.530
Well, tough [bleep]

33:54.530 --> 33:55.830
-mike?
-Yep.

33:55.830 --> 33:57.260
I don't know what
your problem is, brother.

33:57.260 --> 33:58.860
My problem is
I'm tired of getting

33:58.870 --> 34:00.570
[bleep] out of time while y'all
take all the time you need.

34:00.570 --> 34:02.270
How are you getting [bleep]?
You don't like it, [bleep] off.

34:02.270 --> 34:04.500
Every time you ask me
to help you, I help you.

34:04.510 --> 34:06.710
Y'all give me 3 [bleep]
days the last build.

34:06.710 --> 34:08.110
-Did we --
-three [bleep] days, jason.

34:08.110 --> 34:09.340
Did we do that?

34:09.340 --> 34:10.740
-Yes, y'all did that.
-Did we?

34:10.740 --> 34:13.150
-Yes, y'all did that.
-No, that is not true.

34:13.150 --> 34:14.550
Then who?
Then what?

34:14.550 --> 34:15.780
Then who [bleep]
did it?

34:15.780 --> 34:18.950
Mike, you're out of line,
brother.

34:18.950 --> 34:20.650
Coy: I'm at the point
where I get the time

34:20.650 --> 34:22.490
I need, or they can
find somebody else to

34:22.490 --> 34:23.590
[bleep] paint it.
I'm serious.

34:23.590 --> 34:25.920
I'm [bleep] tired of it.

34:25.930 --> 34:27.960
And the good news
is mike didn't quit,

34:27.960 --> 34:30.600
and he laid down an exceptional
paint job on the 1934 ford,

34:30.600 --> 34:34.300
and they're both
still good friends.

34:34.300 --> 34:35.870
Oh, no.

34:35.870 --> 34:37.270
-I love you.
-Oh, my god.

34:37.270 --> 34:40.270
-Ugh.
-Got that was awkward.

34:40.270 --> 34:42.340
-You are the yin to my yang.
-Wow.

34:42.340 --> 34:45.010
That got weird fast, but not
as weird as this next segment.

34:45.010 --> 34:47.180
If you're just tuning in,
well, shame on you.

34:47.180 --> 34:48.680
Second, you probably
don't know that

34:48.680 --> 34:50.520
discovery thought it would be
cool to have a little winter

34:50.520 --> 34:54.220
competition of our own in honor
of that big gold medal thing

34:54.220 --> 34:55.720
that was going on in
south korea,

34:55.720 --> 34:58.290
and one of the hits
of that was curling,

34:58.290 --> 35:01.390
and we thought we'd give our own
gas monkey spin on curling.

35:01.400 --> 35:02.530
Watch this.

35:02.530 --> 35:05.130
Welcome back, sports fans.

35:05.130 --> 35:06.830
We're nearing the end
of this year's gas monkey games,

35:06.830 --> 35:08.600
and next up is curling.

35:08.600 --> 35:10.500
Each team is going to push
those blocks of ice

35:10.500 --> 35:14.070
down towards this bull's-eye,
I think.

35:14.070 --> 35:15.470
His form looks terrible.

35:15.480 --> 35:17.980
-Grab my feet.
-Wow.

35:17.980 --> 35:19.640
I didn't realize this was
whale curling.

35:19.650 --> 35:22.480
Slow down, tom.
Slow down. Slow down.

35:22.480 --> 35:24.720
I have a feeling
that's cheating.

35:24.720 --> 35:26.620
So next up, we have
the gas monkey team.

35:26.620 --> 35:28.190
Hopefully,
they have a better grasp

35:28.190 --> 35:29.450
on what's supposed to happen.

35:29.460 --> 35:30.620
-Keep it on track, mike.
-Y'all ready?

35:30.620 --> 35:31.760
Keep it on the track.

35:31.760 --> 35:32.890
Richard: When you're done
with that curling,

35:32.890 --> 35:34.030
you need to come in
and sweep the floor.

35:34.030 --> 35:36.730
Okay, mike.

is in the books.

So, okay, I know the u.S. Won
a medal in curling,

35:49.640 --> 35:51.280
but does anybody
really know what curling is?

35:51.280 --> 35:52.980
-Well, I do.
-Really?

35:52.980 --> 35:55.280
Well, I was a captain of my
curling team in high school.

35:55.280 --> 35:56.650
-Come on.
-Yeah.

35:56.650 --> 35:58.580
We had practice every Wednesday
right after tea club.

35:58.590 --> 36:00.550

Enough about that.

we got monkey outtakes coming up

of the gas monkey games

around.

It's getting weird.

36:10.900 --> 36:13.230
...Never-before-seen
monkey outtakes.

and get to work.

come to a close.

36:18.570 --> 36:20.840

Are they like trick candles
or something?

but it's really --

36:34.120 --> 36:35.520

Here at gas monkey, we never
miss a chance to celebrate,

going to be pissed.

37:27.740 --> 37:29.240
Welcome back, everybody.

A lot of blood, sweat and beers
goes into making these shows,

37:30.910 --> 37:32.710
and the end results
speak for themselves,

37:32.710 --> 37:34.010

37:34.010 --> 37:36.250
we don't always get it
right the first time.

Beyond that, the biggest
issue is the front wheels.

are back there talking

we set the bar.

how people feel,

behind me, isn't he?
