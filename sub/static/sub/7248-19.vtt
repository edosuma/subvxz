WEBVTT

00:02.215 --> 00:03.772
Previously on Gilmore Girls...

00:03.849 --> 00:04.837
I did what you said.

00:04.917 --> 00:07.885
I had it worked out
and asked him if he'd like to go to dinner...

00:07.952 --> 00:10.010
- at Chez Fleur on Sunday.
- Very nice.

00:10.088 --> 00:12.419
He said he would love to,
but his cousin's in town...

00:12.489 --> 00:15.651
- and is staying with him for the week.
- Then just make it next week.

00:15.726 --> 00:17.784
- I came up with another option.
- Which is?

00:17.860 --> 00:18.848
That we double-date.

00:18.928 --> 00:20.895
No, I hate blind dates.

00:20.962 --> 00:23.156
It figures that
the only Korean boy at this party...

00:23.231 --> 00:25.289
has his Korean-girl radar turned on.

00:25.966 --> 00:28.695
- I'm Henry.
- I'm Lane. This is Rory and Paris.

00:28.769 --> 00:31.532
Thank you. You will not regret this.

00:31.604 --> 00:34.970
Lorelai, this is my cousin, Rune.
Rune, this is Lorelai.

00:35.040 --> 00:36.597
Hi. It's very nice to meet you.

00:36.675 --> 00:38.369
I can't believe you set me up with that.

00:38.443 --> 00:40.137
Was the bearded lady busy tonight?

00:40.211 --> 00:42.678
He speaks Korean fluently,
he respects his parents.

00:42.747 --> 00:46.705
And he's also really cute, very funny,
and surprisingly interesting.

00:46.783 --> 00:49.444
I'm sorry, but I'm totally failing
to see the problem.

00:49.518 --> 00:51.781
I'm falling for a guy
my parents would approve of!

00:51.854 --> 00:53.787
Tomorrow, if you have time...

00:53.855 --> 00:57.017
I'm planning on despising everyone
who says, 'Hey, how's it going?'

00:57.091 --> 00:58.421
You're on.

00:59.526 --> 01:02.392
- Hey, how's it going?
- No, that's just too easy.

01:02.628 --> 01:04.424
- Rachel.
- Your Rachel?

01:05.664 --> 01:08.029
- You're Rachel?
- Yep, I'm Rachel.

01:08.233 --> 01:10.462
- I have to get home.
- Stay for one more dance.

01:10.534 --> 01:11.693
- I don't think...
- Yes.

01:11.769 --> 01:12.962
One dance would be fine.

01:13.037 --> 01:14.025
Great.

01:14.105 --> 01:16.072
Please, don't let me drive you away.

01:16.139 --> 01:18.231
You're not. I have to go sit in a closet...

01:18.341 --> 01:23.208
- So, where's Rachel?
- She's a founder's party-punch junkie.

01:23.312 --> 01:25.643
- Is she staying?
- I don't know.

01:26.681 --> 01:29.114
- Do you want her to?
- I don't know.

01:30.984 --> 01:33.451
Can I have some baby pictures
of you and Grandpa?

01:33.519 --> 01:34.644
Any particular reason?

01:34.720 --> 01:37.517
We're doing this visual
family-history project for school.

01:37.589 --> 01:39.954
If it's for school, I could dig something up.

01:40.024 --> 01:42.958
- I need some of Mom, too.
- I thought we had this conversation.

01:43.026 --> 01:45.619
- Yeah, but I don't believe you.
- Mother, tell her.

01:45.696 --> 01:48.425
- I don't have baby pictures of your mother.
- Thank you.

01:48.498 --> 01:50.192
How could you not have baby pictures?

01:50.266 --> 01:54.133
Because when she was seven, I found her
burning all of her baby pictures.

01:54.202 --> 01:56.897
Why would you do that?
I'm sure you were a cute baby.

01:56.971 --> 01:59.530
- She was very cute.
- Four, three, two, one.

01:59.607 --> 02:01.506
- In most respects.
- Then we have lift off.

02:01.574 --> 02:03.165
- What does that mean?
- Nothing.

02:03.243 --> 02:06.040
I don't see what the problem is.
You certainly grew into it.

02:06.111 --> 02:07.099
Grown into what?

02:07.179 --> 02:09.840
As a child, your mother
had an unusually large head.

02:09.913 --> 02:12.347
The best thing about it was
she'd tell me constantly.

02:12.417 --> 02:14.611
My first sentence was,
'Big head want dolly. '

02:14.684 --> 02:17.174
- I can't imagine it being that bad.
- It wasn't.

02:17.254 --> 02:19.050
It just affected her balance a little...

02:19.121 --> 02:22.214
Can we talk about something
besides my formerly huge head?

02:22.290 --> 02:23.654
Are these new chairs, Grandma?

02:23.725 --> 02:25.885
- Why, yes, Rory, they are.
- They are?

02:25.960 --> 02:28.086
I got them from a dealer
in Maine last summer.

02:28.162 --> 02:30.561
- He just restored them.
- They look like the old ones.

02:30.631 --> 02:32.154
- They're nice.
- Sure they're new?

02:32.231 --> 02:34.858
- Of course. I bought them.
- I don't see any difference.

02:34.934 --> 02:38.096
The arch in the back is higher,
and they have a different leg.

02:38.170 --> 02:39.193
No difference.

02:39.271 --> 02:41.966
I could only get 10,
so I'm two chairs short of a set.

02:42.039 --> 02:43.062
You're telling me.

02:43.140 --> 02:45.539
- Do you realize how rare these chairs are?
- No.

02:45.608 --> 02:47.336
I've searched for three years for them.

02:47.410 --> 02:50.173
I'd combed every fine antique store
on the East Coast...

02:50.245 --> 02:53.077
and this is all I could find.
I blame Peg Mossley.

02:53.382 --> 02:56.316
- Peg Mossley, evil woman.
- What did Peg Mossley do?

02:56.384 --> 02:59.147
She lured two German children
to her gingerbread house...

02:59.219 --> 03:02.210
and then she tried to eat them.
Pass the artichokes, please.

03:02.289 --> 03:05.655
I made the mistake of telling Peg
all my favorite special spots...

03:05.724 --> 03:08.556
and that woman moved in
and completely wiped them out.

03:08.626 --> 03:11.651
You can't find a decent Biedermeier hutch
in all of Connecticut.

03:11.729 --> 03:15.425
- I'm desperate for new sources.
- What about Kim's Antiques?

03:15.999 --> 03:18.831
- What's Kim's Antiques?
- Didn't that burn down?

03:18.901 --> 03:22.063
Lane's parents have
this great antique store in Stars Hollow.

03:22.137 --> 03:24.502
Is that so?
Why haven't you ever told me about it?

03:24.573 --> 03:27.439
I don't know, Mom.
I guess it just got lost in my big head.

03:27.508 --> 03:29.771
Come to Stars Hollow
and I'll take you there.

03:29.844 --> 03:31.640
Like Saturday.
You can come see the town.

03:31.711 --> 03:34.338
- Won't you have to study?
- I can put it off for one day.

03:34.414 --> 03:37.473
- I'm working.
- No one is asking you to do anything.

03:37.549 --> 03:39.175
This is between Rory and me.

03:39.250 --> 03:42.446
I accept your offer, Rory.
I would love to spend Saturday with you.

03:42.520 --> 03:45.579
- Great.
- I'm just sorry that I'm gonna miss it.

03:46.022 --> 03:47.955
Eat your artichoke, Lorelai.

03:49.000 --> 03:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:47.503 --> 04:50.232
Okay, French toast with crispy bacon.

04:50.306 --> 04:52.432
Pancakes, two eggs over easy.

04:53.141 --> 04:55.870
- What?
- You put the eggs on the pancakes.

04:57.311 --> 05:01.076
It's like two eyes staring at me.
See, I can't eat it like this.

05:01.147 --> 05:03.910
- Hence the 'oops. '
- What? You always order the same thing.

05:03.983 --> 05:06.974
You put the eggs on the side
so my breakfast is not ogling me.

05:07.052 --> 05:10.452
- It's the same food.
- Yeah, I need the eggs put on the side.

05:10.521 --> 05:12.181
- You want a brand-new plate?
- Yes.

05:12.256 --> 05:15.383
What if I take this in the back,
take the eggs off the pancakes...

05:15.458 --> 05:17.755
I put the eggs on the side,
and bring the plate back?

05:17.827 --> 05:19.987
- What happens then?
- I can eat my breakfast.

05:20.062 --> 05:22.359
It's the same food,
just a different configuration.

05:22.431 --> 05:25.661
- I won't know that.
- I'm gonna take the plate in the back.

05:25.967 --> 05:28.560
So, what time
does the judgmental express arrive?

05:28.635 --> 05:31.501
Grandma gets here at noon.
Are you sure you won't do lunch?

05:31.572 --> 05:34.734
- No, I can't. Lunch is bad.
- Lorelai, you're here.

05:35.007 --> 05:37.338
- Good. Don't move.
- I won't.

05:37.409 --> 05:38.636
What are you doing at lunch?

05:38.710 --> 05:41.109
- I have very important things to do.
- Like what?

05:41.178 --> 05:44.044
At noon, I have to not have lunch
with my mother.

05:44.114 --> 05:45.137
Very nice.

05:45.215 --> 05:49.207
I'm developing my pictures from
the Firelight Festival. Some amazing stuff.

05:49.285 --> 05:52.776
I'm thinking maybe there's a book
here, Faces of Small Town America.

05:52.854 --> 05:55.185
You can feel safe.
You don't live near these people.

05:55.256 --> 05:59.351
Exactly. And the very last shot
on my roll was this.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.961
- When did you take this?
- When you weren't looking.

06:04.029 --> 06:06.189
- What's that?
- It's a picture of us.

06:06.265 --> 06:07.891
- Us?
- Rachel took it.

06:07.967 --> 06:10.696
- For the Firelight Festival.
- Sure. Yeah.

06:11.603 --> 06:15.003
- So here's your plate. No eyes.
- Thank you.

06:15.906 --> 06:17.839
- Do you wear contacts?
- Me? No.

06:18.040 --> 06:20.837
God, you've got amazing eyes.
Doesn't she?

06:20.910 --> 06:25.675
Yeah, sure, I guess.
I mean they're, you know, placed good.

06:27.982 --> 06:31.417
Symmetrical.
I'm gonna get some more coffee.

06:33.219 --> 06:36.119
- Mom, look at this.
- What is that?

06:36.188 --> 06:39.884
It's an old abandoned inn I ran across
when I was exploring the other day.

06:39.957 --> 06:43.187
This is Dragonfly.
I totally forgot about this place.

06:43.260 --> 06:45.625
It doesn't look like
it's been operational in years.

06:45.695 --> 06:49.095
Look at all the trees. It's pretty.
I'm buzzing.

06:49.164 --> 06:52.690
- What've I said about buzzing in public?
- It's Lane. 911, that's trig.

06:52.768 --> 06:54.359
- Gotta go.
- Bye.

06:54.636 --> 06:56.034
- Take a...
- Yeah.

06:56.137 --> 06:57.899
- Bye, Rachel.
- Bye.

06:58.572 --> 07:02.769
- That is one really not annoying kid.
- Yes, she really is not.

07:02.842 --> 07:04.604
I'll consider doing the mom thing...

07:04.677 --> 07:07.076
if I could be guaranteed
I'd get one just like her.

07:07.145 --> 07:09.169
You can. You just have to go to Sears.

07:09.247 --> 07:12.511
- God! Where is this again?
- It's kind of behind the mill.

07:12.583 --> 07:15.642
Go across a little footbridge
with the mean duck family under it.

07:15.719 --> 07:18.812
Yes, the Armbrewsters.
It's really amazing.

07:19.155 --> 07:20.553
- Do you want to see it?
- What?

07:20.622 --> 07:23.146
The inn. I'm gonna head out that way
in a little while.

07:23.225 --> 07:26.193
Come on, finish your breakfast.
I'll drive us out there.

07:26.260 --> 07:28.090
Drive her out where?

07:28.162 --> 07:30.493
Lorelai and I are going to cruise the docks.

07:30.563 --> 07:33.793
To see how many sailors we'd get
to tattoo our names on their butts.

07:33.867 --> 07:36.630
- What do you think?
- I have to check in at the inn first.

07:36.702 --> 07:40.228
- That's great. Good. I'll pick you up there.
- Okay. Good.

07:41.105 --> 07:42.901
- What was that all about?
- Nothing.

07:42.974 --> 07:45.703
We're gonna check out
this old inn Rachel found.

07:46.910 --> 07:49.810
- What?
- I didn't know you guys were friends.

07:49.879 --> 07:52.779
We're not really friends.
I don't know her that well.

07:52.847 --> 07:55.838
- We're just hanging out. She seems great.
- She is. She's great.

07:55.917 --> 07:58.350
She's just a lot different from you.

07:58.419 --> 08:02.149
- 'Cause I'm not really great?
- No, you're great, just in a different way.

08:02.221 --> 08:04.745
- In a not really great way?
- That's not what I meant.

08:04.824 --> 08:08.384
The two of you are just
completely different people. Both great.

08:08.460 --> 08:10.086
But I'm just a little surprised...

08:10.161 --> 08:13.823
that your different types of greatness
are melding...

08:13.898 --> 08:16.297
and you're comfortably great together.

08:16.366 --> 08:18.833
- Is this bothering you?
- This conversation, yes.

08:18.902 --> 08:21.768
No, the idea of Rachel and I
hanging out together.

08:21.837 --> 08:24.600
Is there some reason
that's weird for you or something?

08:24.672 --> 08:26.138
- Why?
- No reason I can think of.

08:26.207 --> 08:28.367
- Then it's not weird.
- I was just checking.

08:28.442 --> 08:30.272
- Then you checked.
- Okay.

08:30.343 --> 08:33.573
So are you gonna be pouring
that coffee anytime or...

08:33.645 --> 08:37.011
I'm glad it's not weird, though.
That would be bad.

08:37.082 --> 08:38.606
I'll get a rag.

08:38.883 --> 08:41.645
Welcome, Moshira Motors,
to the Independence Inn.

08:41.720 --> 08:43.482
The dining room is right through there.

08:43.554 --> 08:46.147
And breakfast is served 6:00 to 11:30...

08:46.223 --> 08:48.986
although our chef
is an amazing overachiever...

08:49.058 --> 08:52.151
and she'll be happy to prepare
anything you want any time of day.

08:52.227 --> 08:56.560
Now, your itinerary for the conference
will be in each of your rooms.

08:56.630 --> 09:00.030
And if you have any questions at all,
just please feel free to ask...

09:00.100 --> 09:01.532
No.

09:01.901 --> 09:03.959
Somebody else. Not him.

09:04.603 --> 09:07.730
Okay, so ask Roger.
Roger will be happy to help you.

09:07.806 --> 09:09.295
Thanks so much.

09:18.481 --> 09:21.278
- Rune is in the lobby.
- Lorelai! Hello! I made some coffee.

09:21.350 --> 09:22.976
Rune is in the lobby.

09:23.051 --> 09:27.713
I also made those orange-glazed muffins
you like, with warm cinnamon butter.

09:27.788 --> 09:31.018
Sookie, Rune is in the lobby. Why?

09:31.091 --> 09:32.819
- Muffin's getting cold.
- Muffin's fine.

09:32.892 --> 09:35.519
My muffin wants to know
why the fruitcake's in the lobby.

09:35.595 --> 09:37.118
- He's staying with Jackson.
- Again?

09:37.195 --> 09:39.424
- Still.
- I thought he was only here for a weekend.

09:39.498 --> 09:40.862
Yes, 'The Lost Weekend. '

09:40.931 --> 09:44.161
Explain, Yoko, because he's out there
with the normal people...

09:44.235 --> 09:46.134
- and he'll scare them.
- He won't leave.

09:46.202 --> 09:47.395
- Jackson's house?
- Yes.

09:47.470 --> 09:49.630
He won't leave, and it's driving me crazy.

09:49.705 --> 09:51.831
- Tell Jackson to kick him out.
- He won't do it.

09:51.907 --> 09:53.965
- Why not?
- Because he says it's family.

09:54.042 --> 09:56.339
And somehow he feels
responsible for him.

09:56.410 --> 09:59.503
Okay, but has Jackson met him?
I think that would change his mind.

09:59.579 --> 10:01.637
Apparently, Rune had a rough childhood.

10:01.715 --> 10:05.445
His parents, brothers, and sisters
don't talk to him. No one talks to him.

10:05.518 --> 10:07.644
- What's wrong with Jackson?
- I don't know.

10:07.719 --> 10:10.812
He's determined to stand by him
and I have to respect his decision.

10:10.889 --> 10:12.822
- That part I can understand.
- Good.

10:12.890 --> 10:15.357
What I can't understand is,
what's Rune doing here?

10:15.425 --> 10:19.053
- Well, I don't...
- Lorelai! These are for you.

10:19.128 --> 10:20.526
For me?

10:20.630 --> 10:23.393
Yeah, and I also brought
some of my raspberry-peach jam.

10:23.465 --> 10:26.194
- I think you'll like it. Put it on ice cream.
- Okay.

10:26.267 --> 10:29.133
Take a graham cracker, spread some on,
add some chocolate...

10:29.203 --> 10:32.330
throw it in the boiler,
and you'll sing show tunes all evening.

10:32.405 --> 10:33.564
Must be good jam.

10:33.640 --> 10:36.540
It's my way of saying thanks
for helping out Rune.

10:37.876 --> 10:40.002
Thanks for helping out Rune.

10:40.244 --> 10:42.973
- Okay, I'm doing the spoon signal.
- I didn't notice.

10:43.047 --> 10:45.207
I'm waving around like an idiot here.

10:45.282 --> 10:47.306
- You haven't...
- No. Yeah.

10:47.918 --> 10:49.282
- So I should...
- Good idea.

10:49.351 --> 10:50.544
Right.

10:51.620 --> 10:52.984
Enjoy the jam.

10:55.924 --> 10:58.289
Would you mind explaining
the thank-you jam?

10:58.358 --> 11:00.552
I was supposed to ask you
something about Rune.

11:00.627 --> 11:04.392
- Like what?
- He just, not too long ago, lost his job.

11:04.463 --> 11:07.260
- Attitude problems?
- Something like that.

11:07.332 --> 11:11.131
When he lost his job, he couldn't pay
his rent and so he got evicted.

11:11.202 --> 11:14.364
None of this was known to us
when he came to stay with Jackson.

11:14.438 --> 11:16.200
But this is the situation.

11:16.272 --> 11:18.739
So I was thinking
if he could get another job...

11:18.808 --> 11:22.641
and then he could save up some money,
afford his own place, and move out...

11:22.711 --> 11:26.703
then I wouldn't end up stabbing him
in the neck with a grapefruit spoon.

11:26.781 --> 11:27.974
It's gonna happen.

11:28.082 --> 11:30.675
- You want me to give him a job?
- Nothing important.

11:30.750 --> 11:32.808
Good. I was gonna
put him in charge of legal.

11:32.886 --> 11:35.786
I know it's a lot to ask,
but I can't think of anything else.

11:35.855 --> 11:38.084
- What can he do?
- Lots of things.

11:38.156 --> 11:40.783
He's always fiddling around, using screws.

11:40.859 --> 11:43.122
- Once I saw him use a hammer.
- A hammer?

11:43.193 --> 11:45.956
He could be a handyman.
You've been looking for a handyman.

11:46.029 --> 11:47.359
I couldn't pay him very much.

11:47.430 --> 11:50.921
That's okay. Maybe he could just work
for room and board.

11:51.500 --> 11:53.467
- You want him to live here?
- No.

11:53.535 --> 11:56.094
- What about the old potting shed?
- The old potting shed?

11:56.170 --> 11:58.330
Rory and I lived there
when she was a baby.

11:58.405 --> 12:01.840
It has memories
and little rosebud wallpaper.

12:01.908 --> 12:04.637
I don't want Boo Radley
touching my rosebud wallpaper.

12:04.711 --> 12:06.803
A job is enough, you're right.

12:06.879 --> 12:09.540
He can save up money
and eventually move out.

12:09.614 --> 12:11.945
I'll just have to deal with it.

12:12.216 --> 12:13.842
The potting shed's fine.

12:13.918 --> 12:15.009
- Really?
- Yes.

12:15.085 --> 12:16.210
I love you.

12:16.286 --> 12:19.777
I swear to God, the minute the guests
start complaining or disappearing...

12:19.855 --> 12:22.254
- he's out of there.
- More than fair!

12:22.324 --> 12:25.258
- It's really good jam.
- Yeah, it is, isn't it?

12:31.565 --> 12:34.692
- Grandma.
- Rory! Hello.

12:35.301 --> 12:37.996
- What a lovely day to...
- Are you okay?

12:38.236 --> 12:40.669
Guess putting in a walkway
never occurred to Lorelai.

12:40.739 --> 12:44.037
It occurs to her every day
on the way to work. Here.

12:44.108 --> 12:45.472
Thank you.

12:47.977 --> 12:50.467
- Are your shoes okay?
- They're fine.

12:51.580 --> 12:53.171
A little muddy, that's all.

12:53.248 --> 12:57.013
- Here, give them. I'll clean them for you.
- You don't have to do that.

12:57.251 --> 13:01.584
My mom found this great shoe cleaner.
It gets out pretty much anything.

13:01.655 --> 13:04.282
Do you want something to drink?
There should be iced tea.

13:04.356 --> 13:06.255
Iced tea would be nice.

13:09.027 --> 13:12.484
- Oh, my God! There's nothing in here.
- I know. It's a little sparse.

13:12.563 --> 13:15.929
- It's The Grapes of Wrath.
- Don't worry. We eat fine.

13:16.400 --> 13:18.867
No food, no drink.
Do you at least have plates?

13:18.935 --> 13:20.424
Yes, we have plates.

13:21.804 --> 13:25.102
- There are women in bikinis on them.
- The original Charlie's Angels.

13:25.173 --> 13:27.197
It took us years to get a complete set.

13:27.274 --> 13:30.037
You can find the Kate Jacksons
and Shelley Hacks pretty easily.

13:30.110 --> 13:31.337
Even the Cheryl Ladds.

13:31.411 --> 13:34.675
The Farrah Fawcetts and Jaclyn Smiths
are a little harder to find...

13:34.747 --> 13:35.974
but still accessible.

13:36.048 --> 13:39.107
The real trick is to find the Tanya Roberts.
We have three.

13:39.184 --> 13:42.812
You have three Tanya Roberts?
And I was worried. Silly me.

13:43.621 --> 13:45.781
How are you doing with those shoes?

13:45.889 --> 13:47.913
- All done.
- That's amazing!

13:48.358 --> 13:50.291
- What is that you used?
- I don't know.

13:50.359 --> 13:52.622
We got it off
one of those late-night TV ads.

13:52.695 --> 13:56.061
It also gets rust off nails and hinges,
waxes your car perfectly...

13:56.130 --> 13:58.723
- and weatherproofs windows.
- Isn't that nice.

13:58.966 --> 14:02.526
Okay, about today. I think I'll just give you
the grand tour of the town.

14:02.601 --> 14:04.693
So we can start by walking
to Kim's Antiques...

14:04.770 --> 14:06.396
which takes us by all the good sites.

14:06.472 --> 14:09.201
I don't think I wore the right shoes
for the grand tour.

14:09.274 --> 14:12.299
- Why don't we just drive?
- You can borrow my mom's shoes.

14:12.376 --> 14:14.639
No, I don't think so.
Rory, hold on a minute.

14:14.712 --> 14:17.111
You'll be missing
the true Stars Hollow experience...

14:17.180 --> 14:18.942
if you don't walk. Trust me.

14:19.015 --> 14:21.881
But I won't wear anything
with rhinestones or zebra stripes...

14:21.950 --> 14:24.213
or anything that has batteries
or that sings...

14:24.286 --> 14:26.185
or makes animal noises
or moves on its own.

14:26.253 --> 14:27.810
Grandma, I got it.

14:36.328 --> 14:40.161
It must have been something
when it was all fixed up and nice.

14:40.465 --> 14:43.297
Can I ask what the fascination
with this place is?

14:44.768 --> 14:46.257
Me and my friend Sookie...

14:46.336 --> 14:49.862
we've been kind of toying with the idea
of opening our own place together.

14:49.939 --> 14:52.964
- Really?
- Yeah. I mean, someday.

14:53.041 --> 14:55.668
Obviously not now. We're still saving up.

14:55.744 --> 14:58.075
- Are you close?
- No, not at all.

14:58.946 --> 15:02.904
- This looks like it could be a great place.
- Yeah, it really does.

15:03.049 --> 15:06.017
God. A little paint, some pretty curtains...

15:06.184 --> 15:09.346
$150,000 of construction,
and we're open for business.

15:09.988 --> 15:11.978
Did you always want to own an inn?

15:12.056 --> 15:14.421
No, I was still dreaming
of owning a red Camaro...

15:14.492 --> 15:17.153
- when Rory appeared on the scene.
- Right.

15:17.794 --> 15:20.318
It's a new idea
in the last couple of years, actually.

15:20.396 --> 15:22.363
Did you always
want to be a photographer?

15:22.431 --> 15:23.488
Not specifically.

15:23.565 --> 15:26.499
I remember growing up thinking,
'I wanna be anywhere but here. '

15:26.567 --> 15:27.931
That was you in the other room!

15:28.002 --> 15:31.562
I made sure to pick something
that would keep me moving. Constantly.

15:31.638 --> 15:34.765
- Sounds exciting.
- It is. Tiring, too.

15:35.741 --> 15:38.800
Now that I'm here, back with Luke,
I don't know.

15:39.544 --> 15:41.807
Things seem to be going pretty well
for you guys.

15:41.880 --> 15:45.838
I guess. These last couple of weeks
it's become increasingly apparent to me...

15:45.949 --> 15:48.542
things just can't continue
the way they've been.

15:48.618 --> 15:51.984
- What do you mean?
- I think it's time we get serious.

15:52.387 --> 15:56.981
I'm ready to 'settle down,' I guess,
is the creepy, old-fashioned term for it.

15:57.491 --> 15:59.151
Pretty damn scary?

16:01.327 --> 16:03.021
Pretty damn scary.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.859
- I feel ridiculous.
- You look great.

16:10.935 --> 16:13.528
- I look like a Clydesdale.
- You look comfortable.

16:13.603 --> 16:15.832
- People are staring.
- Because you look great.

16:15.906 --> 16:20.001
What a shame your grandfather isn't here.
He'd fall in love with me all over again.

16:21.610 --> 16:24.578
- I think we came through the storeroom.
- Nope, this is it.

16:24.646 --> 16:26.169
This is the antique store?

16:26.247 --> 16:28.476
You have to dig,
but you'll find great stuff here.

16:28.549 --> 16:32.075
This is ridiculous. No one can run
a quality business like this.

16:32.151 --> 16:35.677
This place is dusty and disorganized.
And you can't possibly...

16:36.055 --> 16:37.919
Now that is gorgeous!

16:38.323 --> 16:42.281
Look at the woodwork. It's exquisite.
I wonder if it has a mate.

16:42.560 --> 16:45.824
Grandma, look at this.
It's got little flowers all over it.

16:45.895 --> 16:48.055
- It's very pretty.
- Is it something special?

16:48.131 --> 16:49.358
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.

16:49.432 --> 16:51.558
Then it's something special.

16:52.401 --> 16:55.392
Lane, this is my grandma.
Grandma, this is my friend, Lane.

16:55.470 --> 16:57.937
- I've heard a lot about you.
- Nice to meet you.

16:58.005 --> 16:59.767
Can I talk to you for a sec?

16:59.840 --> 17:02.831
Go. Talk. I have a lot of looking to do here.

17:03.375 --> 17:05.001
- Problem.
- Hit me.

17:05.077 --> 17:07.806
It's been a week since that party
and he has not called.

17:07.878 --> 17:09.846
- He said he'd call.
- Maybe he's been busy.

17:09.914 --> 17:11.642
Maybe he has a girlfriend.

17:11.883 --> 17:15.318
A tiny, perfect Korean girl that his parents
will love and approve of.

17:15.385 --> 17:18.580
You're a tiny, perfect Korean girl
that his parents will approve of.

17:18.654 --> 17:20.314
- No, they'd know.
- Know what?

17:20.388 --> 17:21.912
Know I listen to the wrong music...

17:21.990 --> 17:24.219
and wish I could go blond
without looking bad.

17:24.291 --> 17:26.486
That I'd take a WHOPPER over kimchi
in a heartbeat.

17:26.560 --> 17:29.790
- Now you're just going crazy.
- He doesn't like me, he won't call.

17:29.864 --> 17:32.457
It's not the end of the world.
I'll live. I'll go on.

17:32.532 --> 17:35.227
There's always college,
unless my parents get their way...

17:35.300 --> 17:38.496
and then it's,'I take thee, Jesus,
to be my lawful wedded husband. '

17:38.570 --> 17:41.402
Lane, with all due respect to your fiance,
Henry will call.

17:41.472 --> 17:42.631
No, he's not.

17:42.707 --> 17:46.733
Then why did he talk to you all night
and follow you everywhere you went...

17:46.810 --> 17:48.367
and ask you to dance six times?

17:48.445 --> 17:50.309
- Was it six times?
- It was six times.

17:50.379 --> 17:53.176
He didn't ask you to dance
because you're a good dancer.

17:53.248 --> 17:56.375
To tell the you the truth,
and as much as I love you, you're not.

17:56.451 --> 17:58.077
- Really?
- You're an embarrassment...

17:58.152 --> 18:00.312
- to the art of dancing.
- Thank you.

18:01.021 --> 18:03.352
That's mid-19th century.
Four different kinds of wood.

18:03.422 --> 18:04.683
- Is it missing an inlay?
- No.

18:04.757 --> 18:06.553
- I thought so.
- Perfect condition!

18:06.625 --> 18:08.319
- How much?
- $3,500 for the pair.

18:08.393 --> 18:09.757
- You must be joking!
- No joke.

18:09.828 --> 18:12.887
- Nice, but not that nice.
- Not a better pair on the East Coast.

18:12.963 --> 18:14.486
- $2,000.
- You're from Hartford.

18:14.565 --> 18:17.590
Yes. It doesn't matter where I'm from.
I know they're overpriced.

18:17.667 --> 18:19.293
- See the bottom.
- They're not signed.

18:19.369 --> 18:21.859
- Look on the bottom!
- Are they signed?

18:21.937 --> 18:23.733
- They're signed.
- Are they authentic?

18:23.805 --> 18:25.772
- You have my word.
- Letter of authentication?

18:25.840 --> 18:28.239
- That, too.
- It's like watching the Williams sisters.

18:28.309 --> 18:30.071
- I wish we had popcorn.
- I won't take it.

18:30.143 --> 18:31.769
- Then someone else will!
- Eventually.

18:31.845 --> 18:32.970
- I can wait.
- So can I.

18:33.046 --> 18:34.876
- It's my last offer.
- I'll think about it.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.244
- I'll waive the tax.
- And throw in delivery.

18:37.616 --> 18:39.082
We appreciate your business.

18:39.551 --> 18:41.211
I like that woman.

18:41.586 --> 18:44.349
And you know what? I like these shoes.

18:44.688 --> 18:47.212
You're becoming one of us, Grandma.

18:47.390 --> 18:48.822
- This way?
- Yeah.

18:48.891 --> 18:51.222
Great. I love this street.

18:54.362 --> 18:57.558
- May I help you?
- I need to know where my room is.

18:59.366 --> 19:01.333
Are you sure you are in the right place?

19:01.401 --> 19:04.267
Perhaps you want the YMCA
or the local bus station?

19:04.337 --> 19:06.497
- You speak English?
- You have a reservation?

19:06.572 --> 19:09.005
- I work here.
- I do not think so.

19:09.074 --> 19:10.665
You see, we have standards.

19:10.741 --> 19:14.437
And even if they were much lower,
you would still be poor boy out of luck.

19:14.511 --> 19:16.410
I'm the new handyman. Lorelai hired me.

19:16.479 --> 19:18.139
- You know Lorelai.
- I dated her.

19:18.215 --> 19:19.909
- You did?
- Don't spread it around.

19:19.982 --> 19:23.417
- It's not one of my shining moments.
- You've so many to pick from.

19:23.484 --> 19:25.178
- You're rude.
- You've cut me to the quick.

19:25.253 --> 19:27.982
- Out of here, teeny tiny man.
- I will only be pushed so far!

19:28.055 --> 19:30.614
- And obviously, it's down.
- Rune, you made it. Great.

19:30.691 --> 19:33.887
- Finally. Will you tell this guy who I am?
- This is Rune.

19:33.960 --> 19:35.893
- You know him?
- He's our new handyman.

19:35.962 --> 19:37.519
- See? Handyman.
- Be quiet.

19:37.596 --> 19:38.857
Go build us another statue.

19:38.930 --> 19:40.556
- You hired this man?
- Yes.

19:40.632 --> 19:41.996
Did you date him also?

19:42.066 --> 19:44.898
I didn't date him.
I didn't date you. It was one night.

19:44.969 --> 19:47.732
- One night. You and him together?
- I'll explain later.

19:47.804 --> 19:49.668
- I cannot wait.
- Yes.

19:49.739 --> 19:52.832
Come with me.
I'll show you where you're gonna stay.

19:52.908 --> 19:54.898
Could you ask your bellboy
to grab my stuff?

19:54.976 --> 19:56.909
I sprained my shoulder
on the way over here.

19:56.978 --> 19:59.070
- Relax. I got it.
- Great.

20:02.682 --> 20:04.171
Move it, Rune.

20:08.620 --> 20:10.314
So what do you think?

20:11.155 --> 20:13.179
I think it's very nice.

20:13.290 --> 20:16.588
Mom's office is right back there.
You have to see the dining room.

20:16.660 --> 20:19.526
They got the chandeliers
from one of Martha Washington's houses.

20:19.595 --> 20:21.721
- Do you spend a lot of time here?
- Yeah.

20:21.797 --> 20:23.559
I work here a couple afternoons a week.

20:23.632 --> 20:27.465
And I help out with special occasions.
They have a lot of weddings here.

20:27.534 --> 20:29.660
- I wonder where Mom is.
- Don't bother her.

20:29.737 --> 20:32.796
- I'm sure she's busy.
- No, she'd want to say hi.

20:33.506 --> 20:35.996
- Michel, where's Mom?
- Off with her boyfriend.

20:36.074 --> 20:39.270
- What boyfriend?
- Small, dark, wanted in four states.

20:39.978 --> 20:43.674
Do you know when she's coming back?
My grandma's here, we wanna say hi.

20:43.748 --> 20:44.941
Your grandmother.

20:45.015 --> 20:47.005
- Emily Gilmore.
- Michel Gerard.

20:58.659 --> 21:00.455
We'd better go find Mom.

21:00.527 --> 21:04.326
- It's been a pleasure meeting you.
- The pleasure is all mine.

21:05.331 --> 21:07.321
What a charming man.

21:09.501 --> 21:10.489
Mom, hi.

21:11.469 --> 21:14.096
- Mom, hi.
- It's quite a place you've got here.

21:14.171 --> 21:18.368
It's not really my place. I just work here.
I thought you were gonna go antiquing.

21:18.441 --> 21:21.534
- We did, and then we had lunch.
- Really? Where?

21:21.610 --> 21:23.702
- Teriyaki Joe's.
- You're kidding.

21:23.779 --> 21:25.109
- She picked.
- You did?

21:25.180 --> 21:26.373
It looked festive.

21:26.447 --> 21:28.414
I can't picture you at Teriyaki Joe's...

21:28.482 --> 21:31.314
or in jogging shoes.
What's up, working girl?

21:31.384 --> 21:33.112
Rory decided we should take...

21:33.186 --> 21:34.948
the grand tour of the town, walking.

21:35.020 --> 21:37.078
I hope you don't mind.
I also borrowed your socks.

21:37.156 --> 21:39.646
I don't mind.
I wish I had a camera, but I don't mind.

21:39.724 --> 21:41.054
I'm gonna show her the grounds.

21:41.125 --> 21:43.854
Good. On the way, show her the gym.
Jump on the treadmill.

21:43.927 --> 21:46.554
- See you later.
- Make sure you stretch first.

21:51.500 --> 21:53.490
I just love your mother.

21:55.370 --> 21:58.827
So the horses are up on that hill,
and the tennis courts are back there.

21:58.906 --> 22:00.372
It's certainly impressive.

22:00.441 --> 22:03.841
- And this is my favorite place.
- The tool shed?

22:03.910 --> 22:06.275
- No, this is where we used to live.
- What?

22:06.345 --> 22:08.676
When Mom and I moved here,
this was our apartment.

22:08.747 --> 22:11.806
I know it looks small,
but it's really pretty. Come on.

22:12.683 --> 22:15.014
See, we had our bed right there...

22:15.085 --> 22:17.450
and Mom put up this pretty curtain
around the tub...

22:17.520 --> 22:19.578
so that it looked like a real bathroom.

22:19.655 --> 22:23.181
And we would just sit outside at night
when the inn would have parties...

22:23.258 --> 22:26.351
and we'd just listen to music,
feed the ducks and...

22:26.694 --> 22:27.887
Grandma?

22:28.662 --> 22:31.061
- Grandma, wait. What's the matter?
- Nothing.

22:31.131 --> 22:33.792
Did something happen?
Are you sick? Is it the teriyaki?

22:33.866 --> 22:36.891
I'm fine. It's just getting late. I have to go.

22:39.604 --> 22:41.833
- Do you mind?
- What? Sorry.

22:56.183 --> 22:57.672
Good, you got my message.

22:57.752 --> 23:00.914
- Hail the glory of the answering machine.
- Come on in.

23:00.987 --> 23:04.820
I just developed some shots
of the Dragonfly I think you're gonna love.

23:04.890 --> 23:07.949
- Maybe they can help inspire you more.
- Great.

23:09.360 --> 23:11.384
I've never been
in Luke's apartment before.

23:11.462 --> 23:13.554
Really? How long have you two
known each other?

23:13.631 --> 23:17.999
Years, but our relationship is strictly,
'Please, can I have coffee?' 'No. '

23:18.068 --> 23:20.535
'Come on!' 'No, it makes you short. '

23:21.670 --> 23:25.435
Then let me give you the grand tour.
This is it.

23:27.441 --> 23:31.843
It's not how I pictured it. Not that
I have been picturing Luke's apartment.

23:31.911 --> 23:33.775
I haven't been picturing it at all.

23:33.846 --> 23:36.245
- I know what you meant.
- Nice touch.

23:36.315 --> 23:38.805
- Those aren't mine.
- You're kidding.

23:38.884 --> 23:41.317
Nope. Frankly, a little too frilly
for my taste.

23:41.385 --> 23:44.217
I'm gonna give him
so much crap about that.

23:44.522 --> 23:46.352
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

23:48.925 --> 23:51.188
Man, you guys live
in pretty tight quarters here.

23:51.260 --> 23:52.886
This was originally his dad's office.

23:52.961 --> 23:55.554
It was never really meant
for anyone to actually live in.

23:55.630 --> 23:57.756
- But tell that to Luke.
- Exactly.

23:57.832 --> 23:59.992
Do you think about
moving to a bigger place?

24:00.066 --> 24:01.862
- I don't think so.
- No?

24:01.935 --> 24:05.267
Right, because tight quarters, romantic.
Hello, Lorelai.

24:05.337 --> 24:08.305
I don't think romance
has a lot to do with it.

24:08.973 --> 24:12.066
I'm not sure I'm gonna be
in Stars Hollow much longer.

24:12.143 --> 24:14.110
- But I thought...
- I know.

24:14.745 --> 24:18.441
I can't seem to make Luke believe
I really want to stay this time.

24:18.514 --> 24:22.415
- Did you tell him all the stuff you told me?
- Till I was blue in the face.

24:22.484 --> 24:25.111
You just have to keep trying
until he hears you.

24:25.187 --> 24:28.781
I don't blame him.
I've given him no reason to believe me.

24:28.856 --> 24:32.382
I just hoped that magically,
somehow, he'd, I don't know...

24:32.459 --> 24:35.120
forget that I'd skipped out on him
a million times before.

24:35.194 --> 24:37.252
- Have you told him you might leave?
- No.

24:37.329 --> 24:39.193
- Are you going to?
- I don't know.

24:39.264 --> 24:42.255
I feel I've been trying so hard
to make everything good.

24:42.333 --> 24:44.630
But this town,
it's like living under a microscope.

24:44.701 --> 24:46.895
Everyone here's waiting for you
to screw up.

24:46.970 --> 24:47.993
No, that's not true.

24:48.071 --> 24:49.628
- Miss Patty?
- Well, yeah.

24:49.705 --> 24:52.639
I don't know how long I can stick around
waiting for Luke...

24:52.708 --> 24:54.800
when I feel
I don't have a friend in the world.

24:54.876 --> 24:57.366
If you can French-braid hair,
I'll be your friend.

24:57.445 --> 24:59.935
- Sorry.
- See you.

25:00.647 --> 25:04.582
I cannot find your pictures here.
They must be in the bathroom.

25:05.551 --> 25:07.108
So do not want to know why.

25:07.185 --> 25:11.484
Listen, I know this is so not cool to ask,
but if the situation comes up...

25:11.555 --> 25:13.112
and it's not too weird...

25:13.190 --> 25:16.283
a little word of encouragement from you
might help a lot.

25:16.359 --> 25:19.418
- Yeah, sure, if it comes up.
- Thanks.

25:26.934 --> 25:28.491
What, you don't knock?

25:28.569 --> 25:30.798
- What are you doing here?
- Rachel invited me.

25:30.871 --> 25:32.667
- To look at some pictures.
- Good.

25:32.739 --> 25:34.535
And go through your underwear drawer.

25:34.607 --> 25:36.039
- Where is she?
- Freezing your bra.

25:36.108 --> 25:37.472
- Where?
- In the bathroom.

25:37.543 --> 25:38.531
Right.

25:41.179 --> 25:44.045
- It's a nice place you have here.
- Thank you.

25:44.114 --> 25:48.140
- I like the curtains.
- Yeah, Rachel picked them out.

25:48.217 --> 25:50.047
She's got good taste.

25:52.821 --> 25:55.448
- I just had to put something in the safe.
- We were just...

25:55.524 --> 25:59.084
- I told him about the underwear drawer.
- And the baseball-cap fashion show?

25:59.159 --> 26:00.785
I'm gonna go now.

26:04.097 --> 26:06.826
I think he's going to buy a matching rug.

26:11.936 --> 26:15.735
- I like this song. It makes me gloomy.
- Gloomy's good.

26:16.006 --> 26:19.168
- Really gloomy.
- Like, Joy Division gloomy?

26:19.241 --> 26:23.006
- Nick Cave or Robert Smith gloomy?
- Johnny Cash gloomy.

26:23.545 --> 26:28.276
So like a San Quentin-y, 'It's a long
road home, and my horse just got shot...

26:28.348 --> 26:30.872
'but I still got my girl
by my side' gloomy?

26:30.951 --> 26:32.383
You read my mind.

26:32.652 --> 26:36.451
- I'm deep in a Charlie Parker gloomy.
- Henry still hasn't called?

26:36.522 --> 26:39.615
- No, he called.
- He did? Why didn't you tell me?

26:39.791 --> 26:42.054
I didn't talk to him. He left a message.

26:42.126 --> 26:44.116
I listened to it eight-and-a-half times...

26:44.194 --> 26:46.218
but then my mom came home.
I had to erase it.

26:46.296 --> 26:48.263
But I was so panicked that I broke it.

26:48.331 --> 26:52.391
Which is better, because now all evidence
that a boy called me is in the trash.

26:52.467 --> 26:53.990
Eight-and-a-half times.

26:54.102 --> 26:56.035
It was a good message the first few times.

26:56.103 --> 26:58.195
Then I started parsing it for subtext.

26:58.272 --> 27:02.037
- What did he say?
- He said, 'Hey, Lane, it's Henry. '

27:02.542 --> 27:04.270
- Not a good start.
- How do you figure?

27:04.343 --> 27:08.005
It's so gender-neutral. It's how you start
a conversation with a bowling pal.

27:08.080 --> 27:09.137
He asked you bowling?

27:09.213 --> 27:12.272
Then he said, 'It was fun
meeting you the other night. '

27:12.584 --> 27:13.607
What?

27:13.684 --> 27:16.709
He didn't say which night,
like he didn't remember which night.

27:16.787 --> 27:18.913
Like he's mixing me up with another girl.

27:18.988 --> 27:21.717
For all I know, he thought
he was calling the hot blonde...

27:21.791 --> 27:23.917
he met at a hopped-up night
at Balthazar's.

27:23.992 --> 27:25.549
He's a 16-year-old Korean boy.

27:25.627 --> 27:28.356
- Or so he led me to believe.
- What's the bottom line here?

27:28.429 --> 27:30.919
The bottom line is that he wants me
to call him back.

27:30.998 --> 27:34.262
But if I do that, then he's probably
gonna ask me out on a date.

27:34.334 --> 27:37.166
And if we go on a date,
then it could lead to another date.

27:37.235 --> 27:39.668
Then I'll have to introduce him
to my parents.

27:39.738 --> 27:42.035
Then they'll like him
because he's Korean...

27:42.106 --> 27:44.801
and he's gonna be a doctor.
Once that happens, that's it.

27:44.874 --> 27:47.273
It'll be over. He'll be hideous to me.

27:49.112 --> 27:51.045
Now I'm a Lou Reed gloomy.

27:55.249 --> 27:56.374
Hello?

27:56.451 --> 27:59.442
- Rory, hello. Do you have a minute?
- Sure.

27:59.519 --> 28:01.076
This will probably seem silly...

28:01.154 --> 28:03.917
but I was wondering
what your favorite color is.

28:04.457 --> 28:07.687
I don't really have one. Blue, I guess.

28:07.759 --> 28:11.091
- What about flowers? Do you like flowers?
- Sure.

28:11.162 --> 28:13.994
Which would you say you like better.
roses or lilies?

28:15.065 --> 28:17.328
- Sunflowers.
- Sunflowers it is.

28:17.600 --> 28:19.726
Now, what about music?

28:19.802 --> 28:21.564
'NSYNC or 98 Degrees?

28:22.571 --> 28:24.697
'NSYNC or 98 Degrees?

28:25.207 --> 28:26.901
What kind of sick joke is this?

28:26.974 --> 28:30.807
- I don't think I could choose.
- What about the Backside Boys?

28:31.011 --> 28:33.843
- You mean the Backstreet Boys?
- Yes, that's it.

28:35.648 --> 28:39.947
- I guess if I had to choose, I'd say'NSYNC.
- Wonderful.

28:40.184 --> 28:42.276
- Are you writing this down?
- Maybe.

28:42.353 --> 28:44.047
- What for?
- You'll see.

28:44.121 --> 28:47.851
- I'm looking forward to dinner on Friday.
- Okay. Yeah, me, too.

28:47.924 --> 28:49.254
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

28:50.726 --> 28:52.215
What was that?

28:52.594 --> 28:55.426
Sounded like some sick take
on the Gallup Survey.

28:55.897 --> 28:58.091
- I gotta go.
- Call him.

28:58.198 --> 29:01.633
I already left him a message.
He's probably parsing it right now.

29:01.701 --> 29:02.962
I'm sure.

29:06.204 --> 29:07.795
Want some coffee?

29:08.740 --> 29:10.366
Coffee would be great.

29:15.478 --> 29:17.138
- Thanks.
- Watch the lid there.

29:20.015 --> 29:23.245
It really looks different
from back here, you know?

29:23.719 --> 29:26.619
All this is yours, as far as the eye can see.

29:26.688 --> 29:28.848
Yes, it's quite an empire
I've built for myself.

29:28.922 --> 29:32.687
I'm thinking of conquering the flower shop
next door and expanding the freezer.

29:32.759 --> 29:35.090
I didn't mean to kick you out
of your own apartment.

29:35.161 --> 29:36.627
- You didn't.
- You left pretty fast.

29:36.696 --> 29:38.993
It looked like
you were talking girl-talk, so...

29:39.064 --> 29:42.396
- Girl-talk? What's girl-talk?
- You know, pantyhose, nail polish.

29:42.466 --> 29:44.524
- Curtains.
- Yes, that stuff.

29:46.370 --> 29:48.564
You didn't like me being up there?

29:49.205 --> 29:50.637
No big deal.

30:03.483 --> 30:05.643
This is the fascinating storage area...

30:05.718 --> 30:07.810
where fascinating acts of storage
take place.

30:07.886 --> 30:10.547
- Yep, this is it.
- Some good-looking pickles.

30:10.621 --> 30:12.781
- What are you doing?
- I'm admiring your pickles.

30:12.857 --> 30:14.551
- You shouldn't be in here.
- Why not?

30:14.624 --> 30:16.648
My insurance covers only me.

30:16.727 --> 30:20.787
- That's not true. You're kidding, right?
- It's not safe. Something might fall.

30:20.863 --> 30:23.126
You don't like me hanging out
with Rachel, do you?

30:23.198 --> 30:24.221
Come on!

30:24.299 --> 30:26.459
- Am I right?
- Hang out with anybody you want.

30:26.534 --> 30:28.899
- Not my question.
- Well, that's my answer.

30:28.969 --> 30:30.663
Well, we're eight.

30:31.405 --> 30:34.896
Just a friendly piece of advice:
Don't get too attached to her.

30:34.974 --> 30:38.101
She's got an interesting habit
of getting bored and then leaving.

30:38.176 --> 30:40.336
Usually without saying goodbye.

30:40.412 --> 30:42.709
- People break habits.
- Not often.

30:43.748 --> 30:46.477
You're just convinced
that's what she's gonna do.

30:46.549 --> 30:49.278
I'll bet you that's exactly what she does.

30:49.352 --> 30:52.320
Let's say it is what she does.
Don't you think it's possible...

30:52.387 --> 30:54.354
that if she leaves Stars Hollow this time...

30:54.423 --> 30:57.585
it's because she thinks
you don't want her to stay?

30:57.658 --> 31:00.148
- Are you guys talking about me?
- No.

31:00.827 --> 31:01.815
Yes.

31:01.895 --> 31:05.728
Okay, I don't mind if you hang out
with her, but you will not talk about me.

31:05.798 --> 31:08.891
Why? It's fun. We wear plaid,
take turns not shaving.

31:08.967 --> 31:11.457
There will be no Luke-talk, period.

31:12.203 --> 31:14.397
Want to know
what I think about the situation?

31:14.471 --> 31:15.903
- No.
- Are you sure?

31:15.973 --> 31:18.497
If you're gonna tell me,
at least help me unload.

31:18.574 --> 31:22.907
- Can I use the fun cutter thingy?
- Not if you call it 'the fun cutter thingy. '

31:22.978 --> 31:25.309
- Please?
- Cut the box, not your hand.

31:25.380 --> 31:27.472
Good tip. You should teach.

31:29.517 --> 31:31.245
- Fun!
- Talk.

31:31.751 --> 31:34.583
I don't know what's going on in her head
as I'm no Vulcan.

31:34.654 --> 31:38.384
But from the way she talks about you
and smiles when your name comes up...

31:38.457 --> 31:41.448
I'm pretty sure she's serious
about staying here this time.

31:41.526 --> 31:44.926
Let me guess. Rachel told you
she wanted to put down roots...

31:44.995 --> 31:48.760
that she's serious this time,
that she's tired of the road...

31:48.831 --> 31:51.924
and realizes what's lacking
in her nomadic existence.

31:52.001 --> 31:55.436
She didn't use 'nomadic existence,'
but basically, that's what she said.

31:55.503 --> 31:57.629
I've heard the speech. I know it by heart.

31:57.705 --> 31:59.137
I think she means it this time.

31:59.206 --> 32:03.266
- You don't know her like I do.
- I don't, but she seems sincere.

32:05.344 --> 32:07.675
- How do you know?
- Her nose didn't grow.

32:07.746 --> 32:09.872
- Why are you taking her side?
- I'm not.

32:09.948 --> 32:13.439
- It sounds like you're taking her side.
- Wash out your ears. I am not.

32:13.517 --> 32:17.282
- You're practically pushing her on me.
- I just want you to be happy.

32:17.353 --> 32:18.819
You know what makes me happy?

32:18.888 --> 32:22.618
No. I just know you've been carrying
a torch for her for a really long time.

32:22.691 --> 32:26.387
- I have not been carrying a torch for her.
- You wanted this to happen.

32:26.460 --> 32:29.519
- How do you know that I wanted it?
- Didn't you?

32:29.596 --> 32:31.392
- Yeah, I guess.
- Okay.

32:31.731 --> 32:35.860
So here it is, right in front of you.
Just take it.

32:36.535 --> 32:41.129
Take the plunge. She could be ready.
Just jump in and believe her.

32:41.840 --> 32:45.673
Unless, you know, there's some
other reason you don't want to.

32:45.742 --> 32:47.106
Like what?

32:47.977 --> 32:50.376
Like... I don't know.

32:54.683 --> 32:56.309
There's no other reason.

32:56.384 --> 32:59.079
Okay. Fine. Then there's no other reason.

33:00.287 --> 33:02.083
- I'll think about it.
- Okay.

33:03.656 --> 33:07.113
- Thanks for letting me borrow your thingy.
- You're welcome.

33:07.659 --> 33:09.353
I'll see you later, Luke.

33:18.235 --> 33:20.566
She actually asked
if you like the Backstreet Boys?

33:20.636 --> 33:24.765
- Except she called them 'Backside Boys. '
- That is high comedy.

33:24.839 --> 33:27.807
- What inspired that woman?
- I don't know. It was weird.

33:27.876 --> 33:29.934
This sudden interest in pop music.

33:30.010 --> 33:32.500
I sat her down
to listen to a Prince song once...

33:32.579 --> 33:35.103
and she looked like
she was having a stroke.

33:35.815 --> 33:38.180
- Wait a minute. I know what she's doing.
- What?

33:38.250 --> 33:41.047
She's trying to be your pal now.
That sneak.

33:41.119 --> 33:44.144
You spend one day together
and she wants to know all about you.

33:44.221 --> 33:46.882
She's picturing you guys
chatting about boys...

33:46.956 --> 33:49.287
and painting each other's toenails...

33:50.660 --> 33:52.957
Hey, Kirk. Are you getting a cold?

33:53.028 --> 33:55.723
You know, you should try
that Dyna-Meda-Chema-Themytol.

33:55.796 --> 34:00.061
Knocks it right out. But don't drive
your forklift. It'll make you drowsy.

34:02.369 --> 34:05.804
When's the last time you think
Luke's been to a movie?

34:05.971 --> 34:08.563
I think the guy
had to crank the projector by hand.

34:08.641 --> 34:11.541
- Do you mind?
- Kirk, the movie hasn't even started yet.

34:11.609 --> 34:14.132
I like to have silence
to cleanse my mental palate...

34:14.210 --> 34:16.678
and achieve calm
before enjoying a motion picture.

34:16.746 --> 34:18.737
You got that out of a book.

34:23.451 --> 34:26.715
- Luke looks happy, doesn't he?
- Yeah, he looks happy.

34:27.788 --> 34:31.018
- They seem right together, don't they?
- Just right.

34:31.091 --> 34:32.887
Good. He deserves it.

34:34.293 --> 34:36.955
So I did the right thing
by butting in the way I did.

34:37.029 --> 34:41.226
You butted in for all the right reasons.
You were concerned about a friend.

34:44.335 --> 34:46.996
So, if Rachel turns out
to be an evil fembot...

34:47.070 --> 34:50.266
and murders Luke in his sleep,
I'm not responsible, am I?

34:50.339 --> 34:52.966
- Only in an intergalactic court.
- Good.

34:56.244 --> 34:58.108
Rachel seems really great, doesn't...

34:58.179 --> 35:01.511
You are now officially disturbing
not just me, but every person here.

35:01.581 --> 35:04.140
You're the only one who's disturbed.

35:13.524 --> 35:14.683
Hello?

35:17.460 --> 35:19.359
Hello? Damn it!

35:31.104 --> 35:34.539
- Hello!
- Mom, hi. Check the rubbing alcohol.

35:34.607 --> 35:36.335
- How was the drive?
- It was fine.

35:36.408 --> 35:38.602
- Good.
- The foyer looks great.

35:38.677 --> 35:41.440
- I have a surprise for you.
- The rest of the house ran away?

35:41.512 --> 35:43.775
No. Rory, come with me.

35:46.249 --> 35:49.081
Okay. I'll follow you, then.

35:50.152 --> 35:51.140
Great.

35:53.722 --> 35:54.710
Voila!

35:55.223 --> 35:56.416
Oh, my!

35:57.758 --> 35:59.657
Grandma, what is this?

35:59.727 --> 36:01.421
- This is your room.
- What?

36:01.628 --> 36:05.427
Since you spend so much time here,
I thought you should have a special place.

36:05.498 --> 36:07.158
But you didn't have to do this.

36:07.232 --> 36:09.199
- Do you like it?
- Yeah, it's beautiful.

36:09.267 --> 36:11.427
Do you see the 'NSYNC poster?

36:11.502 --> 36:14.993
- Thank you, Grandma.
- You're welcome, sweetheart.

36:15.339 --> 36:18.603
Now, come on, let's go downstairs
and see if dinner's ready.

36:19.409 --> 36:22.377
- You coming?
- You bought her Cosmogirl.

36:22.945 --> 36:25.378
The young girls enjoy the articles.

36:25.446 --> 36:28.903
You bought boy-band posters
and Hello Kitty notepads.

36:28.982 --> 36:31.814
A lovely young girl at the store
helped me pick them out.

36:31.885 --> 36:35.581
- You filled the room with sunflowers.
- Rory likes sunflowers.

36:36.956 --> 36:40.447
- I know Rory likes sunflowers.
- What is the matter, Lorelai?

36:40.525 --> 36:43.322
Nothing. I don't know.
It's just a little weird, that's all.

36:43.394 --> 36:45.793
Why is it weird to do something
for my granddaughter?

36:45.863 --> 36:48.854
I mean, it's not like you bought her a car.
By the way, don't.

36:48.931 --> 36:50.864
It's a room, and...

36:51.933 --> 36:53.422
You know, you're right.

36:53.502 --> 36:55.969
It's nice. I'm sorry. I'm just being silly.

36:56.037 --> 36:59.164
Maybe you don't like the fact
that she has a place away from you.

36:59.240 --> 37:01.036
Someplace that's just her own.

37:01.107 --> 37:02.266
I said I was fine.

37:02.342 --> 37:06.300
Or because it's so large and spacious and
has four solid walls around the bathtub.

37:06.378 --> 37:09.744
- Excuse me?
- It might not be exciting or bohemian...

37:09.814 --> 37:13.510
but at least it doesn't have shovels
propped up against the sofa, does it?

37:13.584 --> 37:16.848
I'm sorry. I missed the checkered flag.
When did the argument start?

37:16.920 --> 37:20.616
Is it because it's not a shack in the woods?
Or is it the proximity to me?

37:20.689 --> 37:22.121
What are you talking about?

37:22.191 --> 37:23.953
- You hated us that much?
- What?

37:24.025 --> 37:26.788
You had to take that little girl away.
That was bad enough.

37:26.861 --> 37:30.352
But to that?
To live there in a shed like a hobo?

37:30.431 --> 37:32.159
Who uses the word 'hobo' anymore?

37:32.231 --> 37:35.324
I saw that horrible little pit
you so proudly ran to.

37:35.401 --> 37:37.368
I saw what you chose
over your own family.

37:37.436 --> 37:40.802
You'd have lived in the gutter,
in the street, in a cardboard box...

37:40.872 --> 37:45.137
anywhere as long as you didn't
have to be near us. Isn't that true, Lorelai?

37:45.209 --> 37:47.699
Mom, I was very young.

37:48.344 --> 37:53.143
I was very unhappy. And I needed
to be someplace that wasn't here.

37:53.382 --> 37:54.746
Excuse me.

38:04.590 --> 38:06.318
- You're awfully quiet.
- I am?

38:06.392 --> 38:08.916
- You hardly said anything at dinner.
- I was chewing.

38:08.993 --> 38:12.621
- You didn't say anything on the ride home.
- I was concentrating.

38:12.697 --> 38:16.962
I feel I've gotten sloppy with this whole
10 and 2 hand position thing.

38:17.201 --> 38:20.294
Seriously. The other day,
I caught myself doing a 9 and 4.

38:20.369 --> 38:23.201
If left uncorrected,
that can only lead to a 6 and 12.

38:23.271 --> 38:24.703
Or, worse yet, an 8 and 11...

38:24.773 --> 38:27.002
which is not only dangerous,
but uncomfortable.

38:27.074 --> 38:28.506
Talk, please.

38:29.944 --> 38:34.004
I just wish sometimes
that certain things could be different.

38:34.080 --> 38:35.444
Like what?

38:35.747 --> 38:39.648
Like, wouldn't it be great if once,
just once...

38:39.718 --> 38:43.153
I could make my mother hear me?
I mean, really hear me...

38:43.221 --> 38:46.519
- even if it was just for one second.
- Are you talking about the room?

38:46.590 --> 38:50.081
The room, the potting shed,
my entire life after age six.

38:50.159 --> 38:52.592
- It's my fault.
- How is it your fault?

38:52.661 --> 38:56.562
I shouldn't have taken her there. I just
thought that if she saw how we lived...

38:56.631 --> 38:59.030
and how pretty it was
with the lake and the swans...

38:59.099 --> 39:00.793
That she'd do a happy dance?

39:00.868 --> 39:03.062
That she'd feel included,
and then, maybe...

39:03.136 --> 39:06.593
The whole 'me running away' thing
wouldn't be such a big deal?

39:08.140 --> 39:12.576
Honey, me running away from them
is always gonna be a big deal.

39:12.643 --> 39:15.509
There is nothing you can do
to change that.

39:17.547 --> 39:20.674
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yes, I would date Steven Tyler.

39:20.749 --> 39:23.216
Can I ask a question
whose answer wouldn't horrify me?

39:23.285 --> 39:24.273
Go ahead.

39:24.353 --> 39:28.015
Do you think you and Grandma will talk
about the things you've gone through?

39:28.089 --> 39:29.112
No.

39:29.190 --> 39:32.920
- You didn't even consider it.
- Sorry. No.

39:32.993 --> 39:35.290
- Why?
- Because it would just end badly.

39:35.361 --> 39:36.384
It doesn't have to.

39:36.462 --> 39:39.055
It'd be like the first 15 minutes
of Saving Private Ryan.

39:39.130 --> 39:40.619
At least they got to be in France.

39:40.698 --> 39:43.359
- You've never tried.
- No, that's not true. I have tried.

39:43.433 --> 39:45.127
I have tried my whole life.

39:45.202 --> 39:48.637
But my mother and I,
we speak a different language.

39:48.804 --> 39:51.636
I talk, I think I'm being clear,
and all she hears is:

39:51.707 --> 39:53.196
'Blah, blah, Ginger. '

39:53.275 --> 39:57.972
But if you won't talk and she won't listen,
then how is anything ever gonna change?

39:58.679 --> 40:00.168
I don't know.

40:02.882 --> 40:05.543
Thanks. Don't tell me you're closed.

40:05.618 --> 40:07.812
- Would it change the outcome if I did?
- No.

40:07.886 --> 40:09.352
- Two coffees.
- Yes, please.

40:09.421 --> 40:11.820
- Any pie to go with that?
- Pie!

40:11.889 --> 40:13.355
We just had cake at Grandma's.

40:13.424 --> 40:15.516
But that was crabby cake.
Let's have happy pie.

40:15.592 --> 40:19.083
- Anything as long as there's coffee.
- I'll put on a fresh pot.

40:20.963 --> 40:24.022
Hey, listen, I just want to say thanks.

40:24.098 --> 40:25.394
For what?

40:25.867 --> 40:28.767
For whatever it was
you said to Luke the other day.

40:28.835 --> 40:30.358
It was no big deal.

40:30.437 --> 40:33.667
No, it was a very big deal.
I was sitting upstairs...

40:33.739 --> 40:37.868
and suddenly he comes in, empties out
his sock drawer, and gives it to me.

40:37.943 --> 40:40.968
That's great! You got a drawer!

40:41.046 --> 40:43.878
- And a set of keys.
- You can put the keys in the drawer.

40:43.948 --> 40:45.642
He's accepting it.

40:46.250 --> 40:49.218
He's believing it.
And it's all because of you.

40:49.285 --> 40:51.514
Actually, it's because of you.

40:52.588 --> 40:55.317
- I'm not gonna screw it up this time.
- I know you won't.

40:55.390 --> 40:57.050
I owe you one.

40:58.192 --> 41:01.183
So you're gonna be in Stars Hollow
for a while, then?

41:01.261 --> 41:04.024
- Yeah, quite a while.
- That's great.

41:05.864 --> 41:09.264
- You want any ice cream with that pie?
- I did get you a drawer.

41:09.334 --> 41:12.734
If I threw in hot fudge, you think you could
weasel me half the closet?

41:12.804 --> 41:15.203
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you.

41:15.272 --> 41:17.102
- Here.
- Thanks.

41:23.345 --> 41:26.438
- Does it taste different to you?
- Yeah.

41:27.448 --> 41:28.675
It does.

41:40.359 --> 41:43.156
- So what do you think?
- It's got a great view.

41:43.227 --> 41:46.753
- And good highway access.
- I love that window back in the...

41:46.830 --> 41:50.356
Library? No, lobby. No, bathroom?

41:50.432 --> 41:52.058
I'd get that decided before you open.

41:52.134 --> 41:54.226
There's absolutely no kitchen space here!

41:54.302 --> 41:57.964
How do we open a bed and breakfast
when there's no place to cook breakfast?

41:58.039 --> 42:01.269
Then it's just a bed.
We'll have to charge half price.

42:01.341 --> 42:03.137
We'll build a new kitchen, Sookie.

42:03.210 --> 42:08.043
I'll need plenty of ventilation and an area
for an outdoor fireplace for barbeques.

42:08.113 --> 42:11.309
Plus storage.
Where did these people put anything?

42:11.716 --> 42:14.445
A pantry and a canning room.

42:14.518 --> 42:17.111
- I'd love to smoke our own meats.
- Absolutely!

42:17.186 --> 42:20.677
I don't know if this is gonna work.
I may have to do some floor plans.

42:20.757 --> 42:22.656
Where is that plumbing?

42:23.392 --> 42:25.916
- Your own inn.
- Cool.

42:25.993 --> 42:28.586
- It's gonna be a really big job.
- Yeah.

42:28.663 --> 42:31.256
Maybe I'll get Rune
to manage the place for me.

42:31.331 --> 42:34.595
- How's he doing?
- He put a tip jar on the reservation desk.

42:34.668 --> 42:37.500
Michel tried to beat him senseless
with the reservation book.

42:37.569 --> 42:39.559
- How did that go?
- Rune got away.

42:39.637 --> 42:42.332
- Really?
- Michel can't run in new shoes.

42:44.074 --> 42:46.507
How long do you think
before you guys own this place?
