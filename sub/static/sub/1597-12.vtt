15:32.208 --> 15:34.667
TWO MONTHS AGO, HE DIDN'T KNOW
YOU EXISTED.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.208
- HE KNEW I EXISTED.

15:36.208 --> 15:38.126

15:38.126 --> 15:40.041
I-I DON'T MEAN TO BE CRUEL.

15:40.041 --> 15:41.709
BUT I THINK
IT'S TIME FOR YOU

15:41.709 --> 15:45.041

19:42.209 --> 19:44.126
HANGING AN UMBILICAL CORD

20:54.250 --> 20:55.750
SHE LOOKS JUST LIKE

20:55.750 --> 20:56.667
