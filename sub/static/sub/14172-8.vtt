00:01.300 --> 00:02.660
Previously on <i> Tyrant...</i>

00:02.670 --> 00:03.870
And my brother,

00:03.870 --> 00:08.070
Bassam... Do you love him?

00:08.070 --> 00:11.670
There is not a
morning I don't wake up and

00:12.070 --> 00:15.210
thank God I am not
running against him.

00:16.410 --> 00:17.580
(both laugh)

00:17.580 --> 00:18.910
(Sheik Rashid coughs)

00:18.910 --> 00:20.080
You're okay?

00:20.080 --> 00:22.420
Do you want me to get
Bassam to help you?

00:22.420 --> 00:23.580
(Jamal grunts)

00:23.580 --> 00:26.320
You think everybody loves you.

00:26.320 --> 00:28.170
Forgive me, I don't.

00:28.170 --> 00:29.900
Sheik Rashid just
collapsed in the men's room.

00:29.900 --> 00:30.610
They're saying he's dead.

00:30.610 --> 00:31.080
What happened?

00:31.080 --> 00:32.880
No, no, no, you
don't touch my father.

00:32.880 --> 00:34.350
- (Barry) We're both doctors.
- (Namir) Ihab, Ihab.

00:34.420 --> 00:35.450
(Molly) Wait, wait.
I got a pulse.

00:35.450 --> 00:36.950
(Barry) How far out
 are the EMTs?

00:36.960 --> 00:39.120
(Jamal) The doctor said
he could still wake up.

00:39.120 --> 00:42.060
I want him to wake up,
too, but, uh, he's an old man.

00:42.060 --> 00:46.450
If you were to
guess... 50/50, 60/40?

00:46.450 --> 00:47.780
Is this why you
brought me in here?

00:47.780 --> 00:49.810
I need it to be 100%

00:49.810 --> 00:51.480
that he doesn't.

00:51.480 --> 00:52.620
Jamal, what did you do?

00:53.220 --> 00:55.720
My father meant what he
said to you 20 years ago.

00:55.720 --> 00:59.590
I have a chance to finish what
he started, but I know you're

00:59.590 --> 01:02.330
the only one in the way
of making that happen.

01:02.330 --> 01:05.500
Situation that you
wanted me to handle.

01:06.700 --> 01:07.860
It's done.

01:07.870 --> 01:09.900
Tucker, I need you to
meet me in the Plaza.

01:09.900 --> 01:11.080
(John) What's going on?

01:11.090 --> 01:13.720
Jamal can't
run this country.

01:14.980 --> 01:17.720
(seagulls calling)

01:17.720 --> 01:20.720
(chattering from the street)
(horns honking)

01:20.860 --> 01:24.330
So, uh, Jamal killed him?

01:24.330 --> 01:26.930
That's what you're telling me?

01:29.340 --> 01:37.310
I tried to help him, but he's...
(sighs) It doesn't matter.

01:37.310 --> 01:41.110
I... I can't get
him through this.

01:41.120 --> 01:41.980
He's not capable.

01:41.980 --> 01:45.650
At some point in a... in a day
or a week or a month, he'll snap.

01:45.650 --> 01:47.760
And... And never mind
your elections.

01:47.760 --> 01:50.870
There will be no peace in Abbudin
with my brother in power.

01:50.870 --> 01:53.830
He has to be removed.

01:53.830 --> 01:57.900
So, you want to have a
coup and oust your own brother?

02:00.540 --> 02:05.670
The U.S. is not in the
business of regime change.

02:05.670 --> 02:08.340
Say that again
with a straight face.

02:08.340 --> 02:10.680
You don't want to
be doing this, Barry.

02:10.680 --> 02:12.210
Trust me.

02:12.210 --> 02:13.850
You're right.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.730
You are right.

02:15.730 --> 02:17.830
This is the last thing
I want to be doing.

02:17.840 --> 02:19.640
But there's
 no going back now.

02:19.940 --> 02:22.410
Tucker, you're not...
you're not blind.

02:22.410 --> 02:23.740
You've heard the stories.

02:23.740 --> 02:28.310
And if you thought I was full of shit, I
know you wouldn't still be standing here.

02:28.310 --> 02:33.750
And who do you think is
going to replace your brother?

02:33.750 --> 02:37.420
I have spent many years
running away from it, but

02:37.420 --> 02:39.260
I am an Al Fayeed.

02:39.460 --> 02:42.130
You're a goddamn
pediatrician.

02:42.130 --> 02:42.700
And you're drunk.

02:42.700 --> 02:44.390
Go home, sleep it off.

02:44.400 --> 02:46.530
I am home, John, okay?

02:46.530 --> 02:49.870
So make no mistake about
what this means to me.

02:50.570 --> 02:54.100
I am the one that got the sheik
to sit down at that table.

02:54.100 --> 02:54.970
Do you understand?

02:54.970 --> 02:57.740
I am the one that kept the
tanks out of this plaza.

02:57.740 --> 03:00.040
I can hold this country
together until elections.

03:00.050 --> 03:03.980
Or you can go back to Washington
and you can say,

03:03.980 --> 03:08.020
"I had a chance to save
 this country and I didn't take it."

03:08.020 --> 03:10.590
It's up to you.

03:15.890 --> 03:19.500
We didn't just
have this conversation.

03:19.500 --> 03:23.900
Until you hear from me, 
you don't repeat

03:23.900 --> 03:25.740
any of what you 
just said to a soul.

03:25.740 --> 03:29.670
Not your wife, not
Khaled's ghost.

03:29.680 --> 03:32.840
Nobody.

03:32.850 --> 03:35.250
(sighs)

04:56.850 --> 05:01.450

Sync and corrected by
Gianluca Belfiglio

05:22.690 --> 05:25.090
Morning.

05:27.690 --> 05:30.130
Jenna, welcome.

05:30.130 --> 05:31.830
Have a nice flight?

05:31.830 --> 05:35.500
Enough Xanax and
any flight's nice.

05:35.500 --> 05:36.830
Hi. 
(kissing)

05:36.840 --> 05:38.130
Mmm.

05:38.140 --> 05:40.040
Single malt?

05:40.040 --> 05:41.710
Charming as always.

05:41.710 --> 05:42.970
Hey.

05:43.380 --> 05:44.540
Are you okay?

05:44.540 --> 05:47.150
I've been trying to call you all night.
(Barry sets glass down)

05:47.150 --> 05:52.180
Yeah, I, uh, just,
um, needed a little time.

05:52.180 --> 05:53.580
I'm sorry.

05:53.590 --> 05:56.690
I should have called.

05:56.890 --> 05:59.390
(quietly) Do you
want to talk about this?

05:59.390 --> 06:03.730
You know what, um... 
I'm just

06:03.730 --> 06:04.930
gonna get a
 couple of hours' sleep.

06:04.930 --> 06:09.630
Uh, there's a mourning service
for the sheik later on.

06:09.640 --> 06:11.970
Please make sure I'm up.

06:11.970 --> 06:14.540
Yeah.

06:18.610 --> 06:21.010
(Emma) Feel better, Dad.

06:24.420 --> 06:26.820
How long will 
you punish me, Bassam?

06:26.820 --> 06:28.490
Just tell me, so I know.

06:28.490 --> 06:31.490
I'm doing everything I can
to make it up to you.

06:31.490 --> 06:34.860
I'm dedicating
 a football pitch tomorrow

06:34.860 --> 06:37.950
to keep children off the street.

06:37.950 --> 06:40.450
(camera shutter clicks)
(sighs) And I'll do better.

06:40.450 --> 06:43.820
Just give me a chance.

06:44.820 --> 06:46.820
So sorry for your loss.

06:46.820 --> 06:48.890
My brother has gone home.

06:48.890 --> 06:51.320
So sorry for your loss.

06:52.330 --> 06:54.740
- Your father was a great man.
- Mmm.

06:54.740 --> 07:00.200
But when Malak al-Maut
calls, every man must heed.

07:03.600 --> 07:06.010
My deepest
condolences for your loss.

07:06.010 --> 07:08.310
Mmm.

07:08.310 --> 07:12.680
I, um... we know what
it's like to lose a father.

07:12.680 --> 07:16.220
I sincerely hope that we, the
Rashids and the Al Fayeeds,

07:16.220 --> 07:20.120
can... can continue with the process
that your father helped begin.

07:20.120 --> 07:22.720
We will see.

07:23.330 --> 07:26.730
My brother doesn't realize
that the work left to be done

07:26.730 --> 07:28.030
is the ultimate tribute.

07:28.030 --> 07:28.930
(Walid) Namir.

07:28.930 --> 07:31.100
Yeah. Excuse me.

07:31.600 --> 07:34.370
When the time is right,
I would like to continue

07:34.370 --> 07:35.870
a dialogue.

07:35.870 --> 07:38.270
Oh, really? Uhm...

07:38.270 --> 07:44.280
Last time you wanted to talk,
well, I guess you got held up.

07:44.280 --> 07:47.610
Different circumstances.

07:47.620 --> 07:49.050
We're not adversaries now.

07:49.050 --> 07:51.120
We're partners in a
political process.

07:51.120 --> 07:54.090
Ah, the election.

07:54.090 --> 07:55.760
It's two years from now.

07:55.760 --> 07:59.490
Mmm, global warming,
MERS, earthquakes.

07:59.490 --> 08:02.830
The world may not even
be here in two years.

08:02.830 --> 08:04.260
What are you saying?

08:04.270 --> 08:07.270
I'm saying six
months would be better.

08:07.270 --> 08:09.840
(chuckles) For a country
that's never had

08:09.840 --> 08:13.740
an open election,
 it's gonna take a year, at least.

08:17.950 --> 08:19.950
Nine months.

08:19.950 --> 08:24.320
The time from
conception to birth.

08:24.320 --> 08:28.860
We owe it to your father
to do this right.

08:30.750 --> 08:32.860
(camera shutter clicks)

08:32.860 --> 08:34.860
(indistinct chatter)

08:40.799 --> 08:43.799
They don't just give
out the Nobel Peace Prize

08:43.809 --> 08:45.970
for simply having elections.

08:45.970 --> 08:49.540
Elections are no
guarantee of peace.

08:49.940 --> 08:51.440
And nine months from now?

08:51.450 --> 08:52.710
(sighs)

08:52.710 --> 08:56.080
A little presumptuous of your
brother, abridging the law you signed.

08:57.550 --> 09:02.250
I could run a week
from now, a decade from now.

09:02.260 --> 09:04.560
Who's left to oppose me?

09:04.560 --> 09:06.220
Bassam caving in to the
Rashid demands

09:06.220 --> 09:08.830
only makes you look weak.

09:11.430 --> 09:14.470
I only want
 what's best for you.

09:14.470 --> 09:18.970
Can you truly say the
same thing about Bassam?

09:18.970 --> 09:22.070
What you know
about Bassam is shit.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.610
You want to know
about my brother?

09:24.610 --> 09:27.280
About his love for me?

09:27.280 --> 09:29.220
I put the sheik to sleep.

09:29.220 --> 09:34.650
Bassam, my brother, he made
sure he didn't wake up.

09:34.660 --> 09:39.590
He... Bassam did that?

09:39.590 --> 09:43.260
Yes.

09:43.260 --> 09:46.000
He is a gentle man.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.330
A healer.

09:48.340 --> 09:54.510
He went against his own
nature to save his brother.

09:57.280 --> 10:04.220
So tell me what the hell you
know about my brother and me.

10:04.220 --> 10:06.220
(belt thuds on floor)

10:12.530 --> 10:14.290
You expecting a call?
(water running)

10:14.290 --> 10:16.300
Yeah.
(water running)

10:16.300 --> 10:17.830
From who?

10:17.830 --> 10:23.640
(grunts) Uh... well,
there's just a lot going on.

10:23.640 --> 10:25.940
Honey, you've worked
really hard to get this far.

10:25.940 --> 10:28.640
(scrubbing hands)
You'll see it through.

10:28.640 --> 10:31.810
It's gonna pay off.

10:31.810 --> 10:33.150
Why don't you come to bed?

10:33.150 --> 10:34.980
Yeah, be right there.

10:34.980 --> 10:37.220
Okay.

10:39.150 --> 10:41.850
(sighs)

10:41.860 --> 10:43.990
(birds chirping)

10:43.990 --> 10:45.160
(TV playing)

10:45.160 --> 10:47.660
(door opens)

10:47.660 --> 10:50.060
(Ahmed) Hey, baby.

10:52.070 --> 10:55.900
My father's dedicating a field
for the poor kids today.

10:55.900 --> 10:58.500
He's a politician now.

10:58.510 --> 11:01.010
Crazy.

11:01.010 --> 11:03.180
Come with me.

11:03.180 --> 11:06.510
Cheer your man.

11:06.510 --> 11:07.680
I'm taking a nap.

11:07.680 --> 11:09.180
You just woke up.

11:09.180 --> 11:13.090
(turns TV off)

11:13.090 --> 11:15.660
(Ahmed sighs)

11:22.860 --> 11:26.600
Why are you taking this shit?

11:28.770 --> 11:32.110
Baby?
(pills rattle)

11:32.110 --> 11:35.840
I'm here, Ahmed.

11:40.580 --> 11:44.150
What else do you want from me?

11:51.890 --> 11:55.560
You want me
to turn on the A/C?

11:55.560 --> 11:59.030
I'm fine.

12:01.800 --> 12:06.870
Are you sure this is
the way to the soccer pitch?

12:11.950 --> 12:13.580
Why are we stopping?

12:13.580 --> 12:17.320
Yussef?

12:19.590 --> 12:21.990
Yussef, what are you doing?

12:21.990 --> 12:25.630
You asked John Tucker
who in the government had

12:25.630 --> 12:27.460
concerns about Jamal.

12:28.460 --> 12:29.630
You?

12:29.630 --> 12:35.000
Many of us have watched,
waited, dreaded the day

12:35.000 --> 12:37.600
your brother took power.

12:37.600 --> 12:42.210
Your father tried as you have
tried, but Jamal is Jamal.

12:42.210 --> 12:45.650
Don't be surprised, Bassam.

12:45.650 --> 12:48.650
You think you went to America,
ate a hot dog, and discovered

12:48.650 --> 12:52.220
democracy all by yourself?

13:07.870 --> 13:10.970
What is this place?

13:10.970 --> 13:14.640
Just a haven
for weary travelers.

13:16.040 --> 13:18.540
(Barry) How did you get your
bosses to sign off on this?

13:18.550 --> 13:21.050
(John) Well, don't get
ahead of yourself, Barry.

13:21.050 --> 13:24.220
- (John) It's a process.
- (Lea) Oh, he's here.

13:24.220 --> 13:25.750
Let me get back to you.

13:25.750 --> 13:28.090
Yeah.

13:29.750 --> 13:32.220
- Lea Exley.
- You're with the state department?

13:32.230 --> 13:35.900
Oh, whatever helps
you sleep nights.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.560
So, John told me about your
brother and the sheik.

13:38.570 --> 13:40.000
Needless to say, 
we weren't surprised,

13:40.000 --> 13:41.540
but something
 tells me you weren't, either.

13:41.540 --> 13:44.500
On the Hare Psychopathy
Checklist, Jamal scored a click

13:44.510 --> 13:45.670
below Jeffrey Dahmer.

13:45.670 --> 13:48.510
He's still my brother.

13:48.510 --> 13:50.950
If we're gonna do this, 
Jamal gets complete

13:50.950 --> 13:52.350
immunity from prosecution.

13:52.350 --> 13:54.610
Him and Leila keep their
money and their dignity.

13:54.610 --> 13:57.650
We find a way to spin it that
stepping down was his choice.

13:57.950 --> 13:59.120
That's a big ask.

13:59.120 --> 14:02.860
It's non-negotiable.

14:04.630 --> 14:07.160
So, where are
we on the M&M'S?

14:07.160 --> 14:09.660
Yussef's
working his angle.

14:09.810 --> 14:10.980
What's M&M'S?

14:10.980 --> 14:13.530
(John) Executing a coup
requires three things...

14:13.540 --> 14:15.000
military, media and money.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.890
You don't have 'em,
it can't be done.

14:16.890 --> 14:21.690
But this M&M'S...
it's also a candy, yes?

14:21.690 --> 14:25.660
Yes, it's also a candy.

14:25.660 --> 14:28.000
The military's number one.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.630
We don't have the critical mass
inside the military,

14:30.630 --> 14:31.900
the whole thing shits the bed.

14:31.900 --> 14:34.200
(scoffs) Well, Tariq's
 not gonna stand by while

14:34.200 --> 14:35.540
I take over from Jamal.

14:35.540 --> 14:38.410
Which is why we need to
remove Tariq before we remove

14:38.410 --> 14:39.480
Jamal.

14:39.480 --> 14:42.480
Even my father was
afraid of taking on Tariq.

14:42.480 --> 14:44.930
He has 200 officers in his
Elite Guard loyal only to him.

14:45.930 --> 14:47.070
Not all.

14:47.070 --> 14:49.400
He's made some enemies over the
years inside his own camp.

14:49.400 --> 14:51.440
We're working a few
leads, seeing if we can't

14:51.440 --> 14:53.790
exploit the cracks
in his power base.

14:53.790 --> 14:55.530
And what about the
money and the media?

14:55.530 --> 14:57.290
(clicks lips) Hakim Bata.

14:57.650 --> 14:59.380
Nusrat's father?

14:59.380 --> 15:03.620
He owns the country's largest
satellite and cable concern.

15:03.620 --> 15:04.780
Because of my family.

15:04.780 --> 15:07.220
He's not gonna risk all
that to go against Jamal.

15:07.220 --> 15:10.220
I believe he would.

15:10.220 --> 15:14.560
The night of the wedding, Jamal
went to Nusrat, told her the

15:14.560 --> 15:20.230
Al Fayeed family must be
certain of her... purity.

15:20.230 --> 15:21.870
I'll spare you the details.

15:21.870 --> 15:25.070
Fill in what horrors you will.

15:25.870 --> 15:28.370
Hakim's wife, Sofia...
She is my cousin.

15:28.370 --> 15:29.690
We are close.

15:29.690 --> 15:32.130
I'll ask her to ask him.

15:32.130 --> 15:34.200
And you're sure
he won't say anything?

15:34.400 --> 15:36.900
YUSSEF: Hakim has already
lost a daughter.

15:36.900 --> 15:38.570
He won't risk losing his wife.

15:38.570 --> 15:40.700
(Lea) So, there's a lot
of moving parts here.

15:40.700 --> 15:43.060
If we're lucky, this
thing happens fast.

15:43.060 --> 15:46.090
A coup's got about a week between
inception and execution.

15:46.090 --> 15:47.730
That's about as long as
people can keep a secret.

15:47.730 --> 15:49.850
You'll have to come up
with a credible reason to send

15:49.850 --> 15:51.880
Molly and the kids back to the
States before this goes down.

15:51.880 --> 15:55.990
And, uh, until then, best
to keep her in the dark.

15:55.990 --> 16:00.160
Your wife the
understanding sort, Barry?

16:00.160 --> 16:03.390
Leave my family to me.

16:06.100 --> 16:07.430
(whistle blows)

16:07.430 --> 16:10.200
(man shouting, cheering)

16:10.200 --> 16:13.770
(shouting, applause, cheering)

16:13.770 --> 16:17.040
(camera shutter clicks)

16:17.040 --> 16:19.340
(reporter) Mr. President,
can you make a comment?

16:19.540 --> 16:25.350
In six months' time, 
this dirt will be replaced by

16:25.350 --> 16:29.420
a soccer pitch with no
rival outside a stadium.

16:29.420 --> 16:32.090
Free to all.

16:32.090 --> 16:35.420
Except this fellow.

16:35.420 --> 16:37.360
He got past my guard.

16:37.360 --> 16:38.430
(laughter)

16:38.430 --> 16:43.970
I will see you all again in a few
months when I cut the ribbon.

16:43.970 --> 16:45.800
Thank you. Go play.

16:45.800 --> 16:49.540
(applause)

16:51.670 --> 16:53.280
Bassam, come on.

16:53.280 --> 16:56.280
Smile a little, at
least for the cameras.

16:56.280 --> 16:58.450
Don't stay mad at me.

16:58.600 --> 16:59.760
I'm not mad.

16:59.770 --> 17:01.130
This is, uh...

17:01.130 --> 17:02.770
- This is good.
- Good!

17:02.770 --> 17:03.940
(Jamal sighs)

17:03.940 --> 17:05.099
Come on, man.

17:05.109 --> 17:10.339
How long has it been since
we've kicked the ball around?

17:10.339 --> 17:12.730
Long time.

17:12.730 --> 17:15.060
(Jamal) Long time.

17:15.069 --> 17:17.030
I've missed this.

17:17.030 --> 17:22.040
You and me being brothers.

17:22.040 --> 17:26.109
Remember our fishing trips?

17:26.109 --> 17:31.080
Tasbani River?

17:31.080 --> 17:34.120
Dogfish practically
jumped on our hooks.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.280
(laughter)

17:35.290 --> 17:39.190
We will go again
soon like the old days.

17:39.190 --> 17:41.190
(cell phone rings)

17:43.730 --> 17:45.230
Yussef.

17:45.230 --> 17:48.860
Got an election to organize.

17:50.270 --> 17:52.840
Heads up.

17:58.780 --> 18:00.110
(Jamal) Aah.

18:00.110 --> 18:01.910
I passed it right to you.

18:01.910 --> 18:09.420
What, you want me to put it in
a box and tie it with a bow?

18:10.220 --> 18:13.050
Ah, come on, Ahmed..
 I'm sorry.

18:13.060 --> 18:18.790
No, it's... it's not you.

18:20.430 --> 18:21.600
Nusrat.

18:21.600 --> 18:22.730
I don't get it.

18:22.730 --> 18:26.530
We were completely in
love, and now she...

18:29.410 --> 18:34.540
- She went through a lot.
- (children laughing and chatting)

18:34.540 --> 18:36.980
She said that, too.

18:37.980 --> 18:43.220
(takes breath) It's good she's
talking about it.

18:43.220 --> 18:46.790
What does she say?

18:48.060 --> 18:52.430
That she was violated.

18:52.430 --> 18:56.160
By that little boy.

18:59.440 --> 19:02.770
We can't judge
these things or her.

19:02.770 --> 19:07.610
We were in love, and
then we got married, and...

19:07.610 --> 19:10.710
now she doesn't want to be
around me,

19:10.710 --> 19:12.050
close to me. (snaps his fingers)

19:12.050 --> 19:14.750
Like that.

19:14.750 --> 19:21.390
What did I do to make her
fall out of love with me?

19:21.390 --> 19:25.060
Give it time, Ahmed.

19:25.060 --> 19:28.630
Things will work out.

19:31.130 --> 19:36.070
(Tariq) Your idiot nephew, Ihab...
He's going back to the Plaza?

19:36.070 --> 19:38.410
He's through with that.

19:38.410 --> 19:41.080
He thinks he's outgrown it.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.240
(Tariq) Ah.

19:42.250 --> 19:46.080
So he believes Bassam's
elections make him the logical

19:46.080 --> 19:49.250
successor to the presidency.

19:49.250 --> 19:51.650
Many countries have elections.

19:51.660 --> 19:54.990
Syria, Iran.

19:54.990 --> 19:57.160
They're easy enough to manage.

19:57.160 --> 20:03.100
In the interest of national
security, of course Ihab's

20:03.100 --> 20:06.270
party must be outlawed.

20:06.270 --> 20:09.000
Problem with that?

20:09.010 --> 20:12.310
They are
known terrorists.

20:12.310 --> 20:15.610
I've tried talking to him, but
he think he's Che Guevara, so...

20:15.610 --> 20:21.020
To win this game, we need
to appear to be playing it,

20:21.020 --> 20:23.490
which requires an opponent.

20:23.490 --> 20:27.660
And the people seem to
like the Rashid name.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.460
Namir, the
sheik's other son.

20:30.460 --> 20:32.290
Too idealistic.

20:32.300 --> 20:35.930
No stomach for a
political campaign.

20:35.930 --> 20:38.430
Walid, serve
your country.

20:38.440 --> 20:39.600
In the name of democracy.

20:39.600 --> 20:40.770
Me?

20:40.770 --> 20:44.010
Sir, I have no
political aspirations.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.190
Don't worry.

20:45.190 --> 20:47.290
You won't win.

20:47.290 --> 20:50.360
But you will help us present to
the world our commitment

20:50.360 --> 20:52.160
to this bullshit.

20:52.170 --> 20:56.640
Campaign for six months, make
some promises, whatever.

20:56.640 --> 21:01.540
After the election,
we have another talk.

21:01.540 --> 21:07.380
One that shows you how we value
your service to the cause.

21:07.380 --> 21:12.550
Whatever I can do to
serve the house of Al Fayeed.

21:15.690 --> 21:19.030
(Molly) We sent another MERS case
home today, which was huge.

21:19.030 --> 21:22.660
You can't imagine to have
someone survive.

21:22.660 --> 21:23.830
Yeah, I bet.

21:23.830 --> 21:24.600
What about you?

21:24.600 --> 21:25.900
How was your soccer
field dedication?

21:25.900 --> 21:27.070
BARRY: Good.

21:27.070 --> 21:29.740
Uh, Jamal shook some hands,
kissed some babies...

21:29.740 --> 21:30.900
- You know.
- (Molly laughs)

21:31.410 --> 21:35.410
We, uh... We moved up the
election to nine months,

21:35.410 --> 21:36.580
so I'm gonna start getting busy.

21:36.580 --> 21:41.250
I was... I was thinking, before
it gets impossible, I might, uh,

21:41.250 --> 21:46.120
organize a trip home.

21:46.770 --> 21:47.940
Really?

21:47.940 --> 21:50.440
Yeah, just... just for a
week so the kids can see their

21:50.440 --> 21:52.040
friends, you can visit
your mom and dad.

21:52.040 --> 21:56.980
Uh, if... if we don't do it now, we
might not get back for a while.

21:56.980 --> 21:58.750
Yeah, it's a great plan.

21:58.750 --> 21:59.950
Let's do it.

21:59.950 --> 22:00.750
Okay.

22:00.750 --> 22:02.550
Uh, how about a week from today?

22:02.550 --> 22:03.750
Oh, honey.

22:03.750 --> 22:07.090
(chuckles) I'm gonna need a
little more time than that.

22:07.690 --> 22:10.860
I mean, I have a bunch of things
to do at the hospital next week,

22:10.860 --> 22:13.100
and the kids are in school.

22:13.100 --> 22:14.700
Uh, you know, Jenna
just got here.

22:14.700 --> 22:15.350
Yeah, I know.

22:15.350 --> 22:16.950
Why don't we give
ourselves a couple weeks just to

22:16.950 --> 22:17.780
sort it out, and then...?

22:17.780 --> 22:21.190
Because this election
is bearing down on me, honey.

22:21.190 --> 22:24.740
We just cut our lead-in time by over a
year to stop Ihab from backing out on us.

22:24.740 --> 22:26.470
And if... 
if I don't take the time now,

22:26.470 --> 22:27.470
then I don't know
 when I'm gonna.

22:27.470 --> 22:28.030
Okay, okay.

22:28.030 --> 22:29.030
We can figure this out.

22:29.030 --> 22:30.830
Uh, how about right
after next week?

22:30.830 --> 22:34.030
Can you ever
just say yes to me?

22:34.030 --> 22:37.000
What's going on with you?

22:37.000 --> 22:38.340
Nothing. Nothing.

22:38.340 --> 22:41.540
But every day, Molly,
every day, I compromise.

22:41.540 --> 22:44.910
I compromise and negotiate, and
just once, just one time,

22:45.410 --> 22:46.480
I would like you to say, "Yes.

22:46.480 --> 22:48.530
Yes, Barry, let's do
whatever you want.

22:48.530 --> 22:49.330
Let's do that."

22:49.330 --> 22:52.330
Oh, yeah, Barry, because I
had such a say in moving here.

22:52.340 --> 22:57.970
Leaving our lives behind,
that was a real negotiation.

22:57.970 --> 23:02.880
You know what... that's fine.

23:02.880 --> 23:03.850
I can rearrange things.

23:03.850 --> 23:06.080
If it makes you happy
 to leave next week,

23:06.380 --> 23:08.880
we can leave next week.

23:08.890 --> 23:11.290
Thank you.

23:17.030 --> 23:19.330
Hakim has many virtues.

23:19.330 --> 23:21.330
Bravery is not one of them.

23:21.330 --> 23:23.360
Does he
love his daughter?

23:23.360 --> 23:25.170
Of course he does.

23:25.170 --> 23:28.840
Then how can he abide
her living beside a monster?

23:28.840 --> 23:31.240
How can you?

23:34.980 --> 23:38.650
We could be hanged for
even having this discussion.

23:38.650 --> 23:41.180
I'm taking
the same risk.

23:41.180 --> 23:43.750
Promise me you'll talk to him.

23:46.160 --> 23:50.960
If I promise,
will you leave?

23:58.900 --> 24:01.570
(plates clinking)

24:01.570 --> 24:02.670
(Jenna) Good, right?

24:02.670 --> 24:04.010
(Emma) Amazing.

24:04.010 --> 24:05.840
(Jenna) Sumac.
(clinking continues)

24:05.840 --> 24:07.510
Never cooked with it before.

24:07.510 --> 24:08.510
Is it poisonous?

24:08.510 --> 24:11.510
Can't be any worse for us
than eating hot dogs with pita buns.

24:11.510 --> 24:14.520
You know, there are people
who would like to do this for us.

24:14.520 --> 24:16.520
Don't you miss doing
things for yourself?

24:16.520 --> 24:18.720
Yeah, that, um...
that was the life.

24:18.720 --> 24:20.570
Funny you
should mention that.

24:20.570 --> 24:23.680
How would you guys feel about a
week-long, all-expenses-paid

24:23.680 --> 24:26.910
trip to a place where you can
cook your own food

24:26.910 --> 24:29.280
and do your own laundry?

24:29.750 --> 24:31.150
We're going home for a week.

24:31.150 --> 24:32.550
What? Why?

24:33.050 --> 24:35.100
Don't you miss
your home, your stuff?

24:35.100 --> 24:36.360
Wait, we're
really going back?

24:36.360 --> 24:38.260
Yeah, your father feels
like if we don't go now,

24:38.260 --> 24:40.260
we may not get back
for another year.

24:40.260 --> 24:41.120
When are we going home?

24:41.120 --> 24:42.360
Please tell me you're not lying.

24:42.360 --> 24:43.360
Six days.

24:43.360 --> 24:44.360
I just got here.

24:44.360 --> 24:45.460
I'm barely over my jet lag.

24:45.460 --> 24:48.070
And Ahmed is taking me to
Formula One next week in Dubai.

24:48.070 --> 24:49.170
Sammy and I can
hang out here, no problem.

24:49.170 --> 24:50.570
- (Sammy) Yeah, we can do that.
- Enough.

24:50.570 --> 24:53.470
We're all going back as a
family starting next Monday.

24:53.470 --> 24:55.610
All of us.

24:55.610 --> 24:58.980
Why?

24:58.980 --> 25:03.450
Because, Sammy, it's
what your father wants.

25:03.450 --> 25:05.920
Well, that
sounds like bullshit.

25:06.520 --> 25:07.690
I'll talk to Dad. It's fine.

25:07.690 --> 25:09.690
He's made his decision.

25:09.690 --> 25:11.690
How very Abbudin of him.

25:11.690 --> 25:14.230
Seriously, knock it off.

25:14.230 --> 25:14.830
That's right.

25:14.830 --> 25:16.830
Coach is fine.

25:16.830 --> 25:19.560
LAX.

25:19.570 --> 25:20.870
Five tickets.

25:20.870 --> 25:22.330
Yeah. 
(knocking)

25:22.330 --> 25:23.730
And you can confirm by e-mail?

25:23.740 --> 25:24.740
Come in.

25:24.740 --> 25:27.910
Okay. Thank you.

25:27.910 --> 25:29.270
Am I interrupting?

25:29.280 --> 25:30.210
No, no.

25:30.210 --> 25:34.810
I was, uh... I was just, um...
Please, sit down.

25:38.820 --> 25:42.090
I know what
you did for Jamal.

25:42.090 --> 25:44.420
Please, Jamal told me.

25:44.420 --> 25:46.790
Only me.

25:46.790 --> 25:49.790
I know how hard it must have
been for you to go against

25:49.800 --> 25:52.200
everything you are.

25:54.670 --> 25:57.300
I want for us to work together.

25:57.300 --> 25:59.300
We both love Jamal.

25:59.310 --> 26:02.640
He needs us.

26:02.640 --> 26:05.840
He'll, um... he'll
grow into the job.

26:05.850 --> 26:07.780
No.

26:07.780 --> 26:10.180
He won't.

26:12.120 --> 26:14.720
He's not you.

26:17.960 --> 26:21.790
I blamed you for a long time.

26:21.790 --> 26:25.030
For leaving me with all of this.

26:25.030 --> 26:28.300
With him.

26:28.300 --> 26:30.870
I know.

26:33.170 --> 26:35.740
I know.

26:37.840 --> 26:39.180
And I'm sorry.

26:39.180 --> 26:41.310
No, don't be.

26:41.310 --> 26:45.720
I just don't want to
be angry anymore.

26:47.990 --> 26:50.990
(knocking)

26:50.990 --> 26:52.720
Come in.

26:52.730 --> 26:53.890
(clears throat)

26:53.890 --> 26:55.330
Oh.

26:55.330 --> 26:57.400
I came
 to review the amendment.

26:57.400 --> 26:59.160
But I can come back.

26:59.170 --> 27:00.900
It's okay.

27:00.900 --> 27:03.400
I'll leave you both to work.

27:18.750 --> 27:22.020
My cousin
Sofia spoke to Hakim.

27:22.020 --> 27:26.860
She tried to convince him, but...
he's too afraid.

27:26.860 --> 27:27.930
Of Jamal?

27:27.930 --> 27:29.390
Tariq.

27:29.400 --> 27:32.230
We can't do
this without Hakim.

27:32.230 --> 27:33.230
You made that clear.

27:33.230 --> 27:36.070
She begged
him, but he refused.

27:36.070 --> 27:37.070
I'm... I'm sorry.

27:37.070 --> 27:38.940
(sighing) Shit.

27:38.940 --> 27:41.940
There is
nothing to be done.

27:41.940 --> 27:44.940
(TV playing)

27:44.940 --> 27:47.340
(knocking)

27:51.750 --> 27:54.390
(Jamal) May I?

27:54.390 --> 27:58.060
It's your home.

27:58.060 --> 28:00.460
(TV shuts off)

28:04.130 --> 28:07.060
Ahmed is out.

28:07.070 --> 28:09.470
Yes, I know.

28:11.800 --> 28:15.140
There seems to be a
misunderstanding.

28:15.140 --> 28:17.910
Between us.

28:17.910 --> 28:20.110
A misunderstanding?

28:20.110 --> 28:22.310
Yes.

28:22.320 --> 28:30.220
Um... anything I may have done...
was for the benefit of

28:30.220 --> 28:31.920
my son and my family.

28:31.920 --> 28:32.920
(clears throat)

28:32.930 --> 28:35.160
The Al Fayeed name,
it must be protected.

28:35.160 --> 28:40.930
- But... I could see how my actions...
- Your actions...

28:40.930 --> 28:46.100
Yes, on... the night...
of the wedding.

28:46.110 --> 28:48.010
My wedding.

28:48.010 --> 28:49.940
To your son.

28:49.940 --> 28:54.650
Yes, I could see how
they could be misconstrued.

28:54.650 --> 28:55.950
(clears throat)

28:55.950 --> 29:01.790
And... for that I apologize.

29:01.790 --> 29:03.790
So it's done.

29:03.790 --> 29:06.990
I have apologized.

29:06.990 --> 29:12.200
There's no need to be
petulant with Ahmed.

29:12.200 --> 29:17.370
It was something between
us, and here it ends.

29:17.370 --> 29:20.170
You love him, yes?

29:20.170 --> 29:24.910
When I look at
him, all I see is you.

29:26.980 --> 29:29.180
We are Al Fayeeds.

29:29.180 --> 29:34.350
We, each one of us,
have our obligations.

29:34.350 --> 29:40.720
The father, to ensure the
purity of his son's wife.

29:40.730 --> 29:42.160
The wife, to be a wife.

29:42.160 --> 29:44.230
And you will be a wife for him.

29:44.230 --> 29:45.660
A good wife.

29:45.670 --> 29:48.670
You can... feel it.

29:48.670 --> 29:53.000
Or you can act it,
if you have to.

29:53.010 --> 29:55.210
But make him believe it.

29:55.210 --> 29:59.340
This will be best
for all parties.

29:59.350 --> 30:04.820
Both our families have
suffered enough, yes?

30:10.690 --> 30:12.760
(chuckles)

30:14.690 --> 30:18.200
- Young lady... 
- Whatever you say,

30:18.200 --> 30:20.960
we both know this is
what you really want.

30:20.970 --> 30:23.270
- No, I told you...
- What?

30:23.270 --> 30:25.700
That you apologize?

30:25.710 --> 30:27.940
That you were doing your duty?

30:28.340 --> 30:29.810
That you're a better man?

30:29.810 --> 30:30.810
Yes.

30:30.810 --> 30:34.480
Do other people believe
you when you say that?

30:34.480 --> 30:36.280
Yes.

30:36.280 --> 30:40.350
So only I know
what you really want.

30:40.350 --> 30:44.620
To take everything from me.

30:44.620 --> 30:47.190
From your son.

30:55.470 --> 30:58.100
Finish it.

31:03.100 --> 31:06.100
(door opens)

31:12.100 --> 31:15.100
(sighs)

31:34.340 --> 31:36.740
(indistinct chatter)

31:53.760 --> 31:58.060
I used to
come here as a kid.

31:58.060 --> 31:59.600
Yeah.

31:59.600 --> 32:01.200
It's very popular.

32:01.200 --> 32:03.730
With the locals.

32:07.910 --> 32:10.440
You know why I'm here.

32:12.880 --> 32:17.080
- (Hakim) As I told my wife...
- (Barry) Now tell me.

32:17.080 --> 32:19.180
(utensils clinking)
(people chattering)

32:19.180 --> 32:22.750
(chairs rumble)

32:26.190 --> 32:29.190
(traffic noise in distance)

32:29.190 --> 32:32.030
(quietly) I won't say
anything about your plans.

32:32.030 --> 32:34.200
I promise.

32:34.200 --> 32:38.870
I have no desire to
endanger my family further.

32:38.870 --> 32:40.100
You're a good father.

32:40.110 --> 32:42.110
You want to protect
your daughter.

32:42.110 --> 32:46.610
Now, the best way you can
do that is to help me.

32:46.610 --> 32:51.380
This is what I got for
trying to protect my family.

32:51.380 --> 32:53.250
My brother's not well.

32:53.250 --> 32:55.090
But things can be
different here.

32:55.090 --> 32:56.150
Will be different.

32:56.160 --> 32:58.260
But not without you.

32:58.260 --> 33:00.660
Why are you doing this?

33:00.660 --> 33:03.090
You are an Al Fayeed.

33:03.100 --> 33:04.090
Jamal is your brother.

33:04.450 --> 33:06.800
And it kills me to betray him, but, 
from where I'm standing

33:06.800 --> 33:07.920
I don't have a choice.

33:07.920 --> 33:08.920
And neither do you.

33:08.920 --> 33:12.420
Sooner or later, my
brother's gonna panic.

33:12.420 --> 33:14.820
And then he's gonna lash out and
when he does, the whole country

33:14.820 --> 33:18.260
is gonna meet the man
that you and Nusrat know.

33:18.260 --> 33:22.260
And that'll mean civil war.

33:22.260 --> 33:23.930
Maybe.

33:23.930 --> 33:24.930
Right.

33:24.930 --> 33:27.100
Maybe.

33:27.100 --> 33:32.470
And maybe when the mob comes,
they won't come for you.

33:32.480 --> 33:35.140
And string you up to a lamp post
and throw your wife and your

33:35.140 --> 33:36.380
daughter in jail.

33:36.380 --> 33:37.850
Because you're all family.

33:37.850 --> 33:41.550
- Okay, look... 
- You think... (laughs)

33:41.550 --> 33:45.500
that you can play it safe by hitching your wagon to Jamal, don't you?

33:45.500 --> 33:48.020
You think that you can
stay on the sidelines.

33:48.020 --> 33:49.860
There are no sidelines.

33:49.860 --> 33:52.460
Only sides.

33:52.460 --> 33:57.360
So, tell me... do you really want
to bet your family

33:57.360 --> 34:02.200
and your country
 on my brother?

34:15.380 --> 34:17.350
Colonel.

34:17.350 --> 34:19.690
The shwarma over
there... Is it good?

34:19.690 --> 34:21.690
It's supposed to be
the best in the city.

34:21.690 --> 34:23.690
Why are you following me?

34:23.690 --> 34:25.989
It's dangerous for you.

34:26.000 --> 34:29.030
There are many enemies
of the state.

34:29.030 --> 34:31.060
I can look after myself.

34:31.070 --> 34:33.370
Still, it would be
best if you came with me.

34:33.370 --> 34:36.870
Sure, just let me
call my brother first.

34:36.870 --> 34:41.710
And tell him that you
plan to overthrow him?

34:41.710 --> 34:45.179
Tucker sent me.

34:45.179 --> 34:47.710
To make sure you don't do things
like walk out of meetings such

34:47.719 --> 34:53.020
as the one you just had, in
broad daylight, with no cover.

34:53.020 --> 34:57.520
Listen... Tariq's finished.

34:57.530 --> 34:59.090
He's old.

34:59.090 --> 35:04.200
His iron fist bullshit is
gonna get all of us killed.

35:04.200 --> 35:10.200
The things I had to do for Tariq...
and your brother...

35:10.210 --> 35:13.370
It sickens me.

35:13.380 --> 35:20.350
If you really do have a way
forward for us, we have to try.

35:24.390 --> 35:27.050
(Jonh) Huh, okay.

35:27.060 --> 35:29.790
Well, that's good.

35:29.790 --> 35:33.390
Wait to hear from us.

35:33.400 --> 35:36.900
Well, golden boy did it.

35:36.900 --> 35:38.400
He flipped Hakim?

35:38.400 --> 35:41.070
And with no exposure.

35:41.220 --> 35:43.550
I'm starting to think he's
got a knack for this.

35:43.560 --> 35:49.560
Look, I know you got a boner for
Barry, but don't get too attached.

35:49.560 --> 35:51.360
Meaning what?

35:51.360 --> 35:53.560
(blowing smoke out)
Meaning don't get too attached.

35:53.570 --> 35:55.570
Well, he's the
only game in town.

35:55.570 --> 35:57.430
Jamal can't do it.

35:57.440 --> 36:02.570
One day he croaks the sheik,
next week he tells us

36:02.570 --> 36:04.570
to take our base and go home.

36:04.580 --> 36:08.250
Plus, our fingerprints aren't
on it, it's homegrown.

36:08.250 --> 36:10.910
It's a good plan.

36:10.920 --> 36:12.950
Mike Tyson used to say,
"Everybody's got a plan

36:12.950 --> 36:15.020
until they get hit in the face."

36:20.430 --> 36:23.590
All right, stop here.

36:24.100 --> 36:26.960
(Molly) Hey.

36:26.970 --> 36:27.960
How was your day?

36:28.370 --> 36:29.370
It's been a day.

36:30.070 --> 36:32.070
I took care of the
passports, by the way.

36:32.070 --> 36:32.670
Good.

36:32.770 --> 36:34.470
Uh, except for Jenna's.

36:34.570 --> 36:36.070
She's gonna stay.

36:36.070 --> 36:36.770
What?

36:36.770 --> 36:38.770
Yeah, she was bitching
about the flying, saying she

36:38.780 --> 36:40.880
she needs some stability
in her life.

36:40.880 --> 36:42.650
- Anyway, I don't want to lose my heart rate.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

36:42.650 --> 36:44.550
Jenna can't stay here, okay?

36:44.550 --> 36:45.850
She has to come with us.

36:45.850 --> 36:46.550
Why?

36:46.550 --> 36:47.750
She doesn't want to go,
 let her stay...

36:47.750 --> 36:49.550
- She'd just bitch the whole trip.
- Molly, I don't need you

36:49.550 --> 36:51.860
to ask me why,
 I just need you to make this happen.

36:51.860 --> 36:54.730
I'm not doing
 this again. (panting)

36:54.730 --> 36:56.830
This isn't how you and I work.

36:56.830 --> 36:58.000
We talk to each other.

36:58.000 --> 36:59.730
Or we used to.

36:59.730 --> 37:03.270
Barry, none of this is
making any sense to me.

37:03.270 --> 37:05.240
Just tell me what's going on.

37:10.680 --> 37:12.740
Walk with me.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.800
(Molly) You told me
everything was fine.

37:18.800 --> 37:21.050
You said every day things
were getting better.

37:21.660 --> 37:22.650
(Barry) I thought they were.

37:22.660 --> 37:23.660
But I was wrong.

37:23.660 --> 37:27.660
So... then we
all just go back?

37:29.160 --> 37:31.330
Just you,
Jenna and the kids.

37:31.330 --> 37:32.800
What?

37:32.800 --> 37:33.930
No, we're not going without you.

37:33.930 --> 37:36.170
Why would you stay here if
Jamal won't even be president?

37:36.170 --> 37:38.140
There's nothing you can do.

37:38.140 --> 37:41.340
I have to stay.

37:41.340 --> 37:44.980
Molly, I'm taking his place.

37:46.480 --> 37:49.810
No.

37:49.810 --> 37:52.120
Bullshit, Barry.

37:52.120 --> 37:55.250
You f... You feel responsible,
he's your brother,

37:55.250 --> 37:57.090
and you couldn't fix him.

37:57.090 --> 38:00.760
But it's not your job
to fix this place.

38:00.760 --> 38:03.430
Staying here, doing this.

38:03.430 --> 38:05.260
You don't belong here.

38:05.260 --> 38:08.100
Barry, come on.

38:08.100 --> 38:10.270
Listen to me, we're
gonna go home.

38:10.270 --> 38:11.940
Together, okay?

38:11.940 --> 38:14.300
Before it's too late.

38:14.310 --> 38:16.940
I can't.

38:16.940 --> 38:20.010
Why not?

38:20.010 --> 38:23.010
Because I can't.

38:29.010 --> 38:32.010
(seagulls calling)

38:34.630 --> 38:40.120
How dare you put me... our
kids in this position, Barry?

38:40.120 --> 38:44.330
This is why
you have to leave.

38:44.540 --> 38:46.970
And then what?

38:46.970 --> 38:49.370
I mean, what do we come back
to... You're the president?

38:49.370 --> 38:51.080
That's the life we're
coming back to?

38:51.080 --> 38:51.870
Interim president.

38:51.870 --> 38:52.980
Just until the elections.

38:52.980 --> 38:56.310
Wait, are you running?

38:56.310 --> 38:59.850
(Barry sighs)

39:00.600 --> 39:02.970
What the hell do you know
about running a country?

39:02.970 --> 39:03.810
Do you think I want this?

39:03.810 --> 39:04.870
I don't know.

39:04.870 --> 39:06.910
If you're asking whether I think
you get off on the power...

39:06.910 --> 39:09.880
The... The prodigal son returns
to the throne... I don't know.

39:09.880 --> 39:12.080
Too much has
happened, Molly, okay?

39:12.080 --> 39:16.050
The sheik... everything
that we worked for.

39:16.050 --> 39:20.290
His death... has to
count for something.

39:21.290 --> 39:24.290
(waves crashing)

39:33.230 --> 39:36.470
They hang people in this part
of the world for this shit, Barry.

39:36.870 --> 39:37.870
Worse.

39:37.870 --> 39:39.210
That's not going to
happen, Molly,

39:39.210 --> 39:40.940
I can't do this without you.

39:40.940 --> 39:42.940
No, you don't get
to play that card again.

39:42.950 --> 39:45.110
You already played that
when you told me...

39:45.110 --> 39:46.380
You lied to me and our family.

39:46.380 --> 39:48.220
You remember?

39:48.220 --> 39:49.750
"Just a few months, Molly.

39:49.750 --> 39:52.720
Just until Jamal
gets on his feet."

39:54.220 --> 39:56.220
You ripped us from
our lives, Barry.

39:56.220 --> 39:57.220
For what?

39:57.220 --> 39:59.260
- Molly, listen to me, Molly.
- (sobbing) No... No...

39:59.260 --> 40:00.890
You made me promise.

40:00.900 --> 40:02.900
You made me promise
we'd go home.

40:02.900 --> 40:06.270
Molly.

40:06.270 --> 40:11.140
I guess you made liars
out of both of us, huh?

40:11.140 --> 40:14.740
Listen to me.

40:14.740 --> 40:20.080
I'll tell
whatever lies you want.

40:20.080 --> 40:21.650
To your brother.

40:21.650 --> 40:23.820
And your kids.

40:23.820 --> 40:29.090
I'll make sure Jenna
comes home with us.

40:29.090 --> 40:31.160
I'm taking my family home.

40:44.770 --> 40:48.840
(silverware clinking)

40:59.520 --> 41:07.830
(Barry) Honey, can you pass me the, 
um... Thank you.

41:08.030 --> 41:13.000
Seeing as how it's been
decreed that we're leaving

41:13.000 --> 41:17.340
next week... permission
to go shopping?

41:17.340 --> 41:21.570
With, uh,
what money, Jenna?

41:29.180 --> 41:31.180
(guard) Mr. Al Fayeed?

41:31.190 --> 41:34.520
Your brother would
like to see you.

41:34.520 --> 41:37.190
I'm having breakfast
with my family, I'll, uh...

41:37.390 --> 41:42.200
(guard 2) This is best
done in person.

41:42.200 --> 41:44.260
Be right back.

41:50.260 --> 41:53.260
(door closes)

42:10.960 --> 42:14.290
Jamal, what's up?

42:14.300 --> 42:19.400
When you were gone, I
used to imagine what you must

42:19.400 --> 42:23.440
have been doing in
Pasadena, California.

42:23.440 --> 42:25.100
Surfing?

42:25.110 --> 42:27.940
Blondes everywhere.

42:27.940 --> 42:29.310
So far away.

42:29.310 --> 42:36.450
I grew my hair out, dyed
it like David Lee Roth.

42:36.450 --> 42:41.960
I thought that was what my
American brother looked like.

42:41.960 --> 42:45.460
Did you?

42:45.460 --> 42:47.460
No, I didn't.

42:47.460 --> 42:50.460
(Jamal exclaims)

42:50.470 --> 42:54.330
Leila made fun of me.

42:54.340 --> 42:55.970
I can't blame her.

42:55.970 --> 42:58.000
(laughs)

43:06.810 --> 43:10.150
I missed us so much.

43:10.150 --> 43:14.390
I'm, um, I'm back now.

43:14.390 --> 43:17.290
That is right.

43:17.290 --> 43:21.130
Brother.

43:21.130 --> 43:26.130
So, uh... Wha... What
are you doing down here?

43:26.130 --> 43:28.870
Looking at a boat.

43:28.870 --> 43:32.810
Which one?

43:32.810 --> 43:36.380
This one.

43:36.380 --> 43:40.150
Yours.

43:40.150 --> 43:44.820
Jamal, uh... I can't.

43:44.820 --> 43:47.820
We can't go
fishing in my boat.

43:47.820 --> 43:50.890
That's ostentatious.

44:03.990 --> 44:07.210
(Barry exhales)

44:07.210 --> 44:09.280
Beautiful here.
