WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:07.673
Wow. That ripped.

00:09.676 --> 00:11.385
That ripped real nice.

00:12.137 --> 00:16.097
How many times do I have to tell you?
You turn and slide.

00:16.265 --> 00:18.017
You know? Turn and slide.

00:18.184 --> 00:20.102
No, you don't turn and slide.

00:20.270 --> 00:21.854
You throw it out.

00:23.565 --> 00:26.275
I'm tired of having to get a tetanus shot
every time I get dressed.

00:26.609 --> 00:30.529
Well, we're not throwing it out.
I built this thing with my own hands.

00:30.697 --> 00:31.905
All right.

00:32.073 --> 00:33.866
How about we sell it?

00:35.744 --> 00:37.202
All right.

00:38.163 --> 00:40.164
But you're gonna have to tell them.

00:44.210 --> 00:47.296
You mind if we stick you in a different
cabinet? They seem all right with it.

01:38.723 --> 01:40.891
Monica, it's Chip.
- Yes.

01:41.059 --> 01:42.351
- Who's Chip?
- Shh.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.103
It was good running into you today.

01:44.270 --> 01:48.023
So, uh, here's my number. 555-9323.
Give me a call. Later.

01:48.191 --> 01:50.484
Chip is Chip Matthews.

01:51.069 --> 01:54.446
The guy who took Rachel to the prom?
Why's he calling you?

01:54.614 --> 01:58.534
Because I ran into him at the bank.
He is still so cute.

01:58.827 --> 02:02.538
Monica, you're so lucky.
He's, like, the most popular guy in school.

02:03.498 --> 02:05.415
I know.

02:07.418 --> 02:09.752
Chip? Hi, it's Monica.

02:11.297 --> 02:17.594
Okay.

02:18.304 --> 02:19.471
Okay. Goodbye.

02:19.889 --> 02:22.975
Oh, my God.
We just had the best conversation.

02:29.399 --> 02:31.567
- I was just leaving.
- Good.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.819
Because I've got a product report
to read.

02:33.987 --> 02:37.739
It's, like, eight pages.
I hope I don't fall asleep.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.449
Why? Did you write it?

02:42.829 --> 02:44.371
Whoa.

02:44.539 --> 02:45.956
Look at that.

02:46.124 --> 02:49.168
Chip Matthews called.
I wonder what he wants.

02:50.753 --> 02:52.254
Well, uh, actually...

02:52.422 --> 02:56.967
I bet he sensed that I was ready
to have sex with another guy.

03:01.890 --> 03:03.765
Well, um...

03:04.100 --> 03:06.685
Why don't you give him a call?

03:13.401 --> 03:14.860
Okay.

03:19.073 --> 03:22.201
- Are you sure you want to hear this?
- Oh, I'm sure.

03:24.120 --> 03:27.372
Chip. Hi, it's Rachel.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.333
Rachel Green.

03:29.584 --> 03:32.461
Yeah. Um, you left me a message?

03:34.339 --> 03:36.673
Yes, you did.
My roommate wrote it down.

03:38.259 --> 03:39.927
Monica Geller?

03:43.389 --> 03:44.806
Oh.

03:46.142 --> 03:48.560
Oh, that's right.

03:50.647 --> 03:53.732
He called to ask out Monica.

03:54.984 --> 03:57.611
That's got to be embarrassing.

04:03.117 --> 04:06.328
Dumb drunken bitch

04:10.375 --> 04:12.709
Thank you. Thanks. Ha, ha.

04:15.004 --> 04:16.338
Now here's a question.

04:16.505 --> 04:19.591
Where'd you guys get the "finest oak
east of the Mississippi"?

04:19.759 --> 04:23.512
Uh-uh. First you tell us where you got
the prettiest lace in all the land.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.430
I'm reading your ad.

04:25.848 --> 04:28.141
- Looks good, huh?
- Yeah.

04:28.309 --> 04:31.812
"Stunning entertainment center, fine...

04:32.855 --> 04:35.524
Fine Italian craftsmanship."

04:37.026 --> 04:40.028
Oh, my God. You guys are selling
the entertainment center?

04:40.196 --> 04:42.114
- Why? I love that thing.
- You want it?

04:42.448 --> 04:44.199
- Oh, no.
- No.

04:45.201 --> 04:47.202
Uh, Gepetto?

04:48.329 --> 04:50.455
Five thousand dollars?

04:50.623 --> 04:52.416
Are you insane?

04:52.583 --> 04:55.544
Hey, the ad alone cost 300 bucks.

04:55.712 --> 05:00.757
All right, look, I'm changing it to $50
or your best offer.

05:00.925 --> 05:05.095
What kind of profit is that?
And you call yourself an accountant?

05:07.098 --> 05:08.223
No.

05:11.102 --> 05:12.644
Oh.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.647
What do you do?

05:16.899 --> 05:19.151
I can't believe you don't know
what I do for a living.

05:19.319 --> 05:22.237
- I actually don't know.
- Yeah, something to do with numbers?

05:25.992 --> 05:29.036
Oh, my God, no. Shoo, kitty. No.

05:29.203 --> 05:32.539
No, no. Shoo. Come on, you. Come on.

05:32.707 --> 05:34.082
Crazy.

05:34.792 --> 05:36.793
- Oh, my God.
- What?

05:37.378 --> 05:39.212
Nothing. Nothing.

05:39.380 --> 05:40.672
What? What's wrong?

05:41.507 --> 05:42.883
I just...

05:44.260 --> 05:48.889
I just have this really strong feeling
that this cat is my mother.

05:50.224 --> 05:52.934
You mean, the mom you met in Montauk?
She was a cat?

05:54.103 --> 05:56.313
No. No, no. She was a human lady.

05:56.481 --> 06:00.192
This is the spirit of my mom, Lily.
The one that killed herself.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.818
Are you sure she's in the cat?

06:01.986 --> 06:05.072
Or have you been taking your grandma's
glaucoma medicine again?

06:05.740 --> 06:08.325
No, Dr. Skeptismo.

06:09.077 --> 06:12.496
I'm sure. First of all,
okay, there's the feeling.

06:14.207 --> 06:18.085
Okay, and for another, how about the fact
that she went into my guitar case...

06:18.252 --> 06:20.545
...which is lined with orange felt.

06:23.299 --> 06:26.635
My mother's favorite fish
was orange roughy.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.557
Cats like fish.

06:36.354 --> 06:37.813
Hi, Mommy.

06:39.649 --> 06:43.568
Oh. I haven't seen this smile in 17 years.

06:46.030 --> 06:49.408
- Dude, Phoebe's mom's got a huge pair of...
- Let it go.

06:52.495 --> 06:53.995
Hey.

06:54.956 --> 06:58.250
Um, when were you gonna tell me
that you're going out with Chip Matthews?

06:59.001 --> 07:00.377
Now?

07:02.004 --> 07:05.841
- Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?
- No. It's not okay.

07:06.008 --> 07:08.718
I can't believe you'd want to
after what he did to me.

07:08.886 --> 07:10.262
What, that thing at the prom?

07:10.430 --> 07:15.267
Monica, I couldn't find him for two hours.
He was having sex with Amy Welsh.

07:16.602 --> 07:19.896
Come on, that was back in high school.
How could that still bother you?

07:20.064 --> 07:22.858
I mean, why of all people
do you have to go out with Chip?

07:23.025 --> 07:24.776
Look, you and I went to different schools.

07:24.944 --> 07:27.946
Okay, that doesn't help because
we went to the same high school.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.198
You went to one
where you were popular.

07:30.366 --> 07:32.534
And you got to ride off
on Chip's motorcycle...

07:32.702 --> 07:34.494
...and wear his letterman jacket.

07:34.662 --> 07:38.915
I went to one where I wore a band uniform
that you had to have specially made.

07:40.751 --> 07:42.752
They had to have that specially made?

07:45.214 --> 07:47.299
It was a project
for one of the Home Ec. Classes.

07:49.260 --> 07:52.721
Oh, my God.
They told us that was for the mascot.

07:55.558 --> 07:58.435
Back then I thought
that I'd never, ever get the chance...

07:58.603 --> 08:00.395
...to go out with a Chip Matthews.

08:00.563 --> 08:03.482
And now he's called me up
and asked me out.

08:03.649 --> 08:07.736
And the fat girl inside of me
really wants to go. I owe her this.

08:07.904 --> 08:09.654
I never let her eat.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.074
- Oh, you go out with him.
- Oh, really?

08:13.242 --> 08:14.284
Yeah.

08:14.452 --> 08:16.578
If it's possible,
could you leave him somewhere...

08:16.746 --> 08:18.705
...and go have sex with another guy?

08:19.081 --> 08:20.790
I'll try.

08:24.170 --> 08:27.255
So you guys having any luck
getting rid of the entertainment center?

08:27.423 --> 08:29.049
There were a couple calls last night...

08:29.217 --> 08:31.760
...but, uh, I don't think any of them
are gonna work out.

08:31.928 --> 08:35.054
Yes, Joey has a very careful
screening process.

08:35.765 --> 08:38.517
Apparently not everyone is qualified
to own wood and nails.

08:39.977 --> 08:41.686
Stop it. Stop it.

08:41.854 --> 08:44.564
She keeps squirming
and trying to get away.

08:44.732 --> 08:46.691
Just like when she was alive.

08:48.486 --> 08:51.279
So, Pheebs, how long is your mom
gonna be with us?

08:51.781 --> 08:53.198
Well, I'm not sure.

08:53.366 --> 08:56.284
I mean, I guess until she, you know,
gets used to the fact that there's...

08:56.452 --> 08:58.662
...you know, a new mom.

09:00.081 --> 09:03.542
You know, I think she's worried
that she's gonna be replaced.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.503
Well, that's not gonna happen, is it? No.

09:07.296 --> 09:09.381
Okay, I have to return a call
in the other room.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.341
Why can't you use the phone in here?

09:11.509 --> 09:16.221
Well, I'm returning a call from
a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.723
I just spelled the wrong word.

09:21.352 --> 09:26.439
So, guys, am I crazy or does Phoebe's mom
remind anyone else of a cat?

09:28.234 --> 09:30.235
- Ross, don't start.
- Come on.

09:30.403 --> 09:34.656
You can't tell me you actually believe
that there's a woman inside that cat?

09:35.324 --> 09:36.992
I believe it.

09:38.369 --> 09:40.829
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

09:40.997 --> 09:42.581
No, you...

09:43.666 --> 09:45.333
You know what?

09:45.960 --> 09:47.836
You're not gonna suck me into this.

09:48.004 --> 09:52.173
Oh, sure I am.
Because you always have to be right.

09:52.341 --> 09:54.467
I do not always have... Okay, okay.

09:58.347 --> 10:00.140
Jurassic Park could happen.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.404
Wow. That's, uh... That's pretty nice.

10:14.572 --> 10:16.489
"Pretty nice"?

10:16.907 --> 10:19.618
You'll have to pardon my roommate.
He wanted to marry this.

10:20.703 --> 10:24.164
We don't have 50 bucks.
But would you be willing to trade for it?

10:24.332 --> 10:25.373
We got a canoe.

10:33.507 --> 10:35.717
You know,
I really don't think we need a canoe.

10:35.885 --> 10:37.260
You gotta take the canoe.

10:39.388 --> 10:40.889
All right, just...

10:41.057 --> 10:43.308
Just take the entertainment center.

10:43.476 --> 10:46.353
And then when you get home,
throw the canoe away.

10:46.520 --> 10:49.564
We're not throwing it away.
I built that canoe.

10:50.816 --> 10:52.400
Good for you.

10:58.032 --> 11:01.618
You guys, you're never gonna believe
what I just found on a telephone pole.

11:01.786 --> 11:03.370
Looks kind of familiar?

11:03.537 --> 11:07.499
Apparently Phoebe's mother
also goes by the name Julio.

11:09.919 --> 11:12.379
You guys, there's a little girl
in SoHo looking for this cat.

11:12.546 --> 11:16.591
- I mean, you know what that means?
- Yeah, 200-dollar reward split five ways.

11:19.470 --> 11:20.887
Do we have to tell her?

11:21.055 --> 11:25.058
- Yes, we have to tell her.
- Oh, but it's made her so happy.

11:25.726 --> 11:28.103
Little girl misses her cat.

11:28.270 --> 11:32.190
Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat.

11:32.608 --> 11:35.527
Okay, ha, ha, you know what?
I have to go have dinner with my son.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.613
Can I trust that when you see Phoebe,
you will tell her?

11:38.781 --> 11:40.615
Yeah.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.158
Thank you.

11:43.869 --> 11:46.454
Ugh. I hate it when Ross is right.

11:46.622 --> 11:48.832
- He is right, isn't he?
- You know what?

11:48.999 --> 11:50.875
This might be one of the times
when he's wrong.

11:51.043 --> 11:53.211
- You think?
- Oh, no, he's right.

11:57.967 --> 12:00.218
- Hi.
- Hi. Hey.

12:02.012 --> 12:03.179
Uh, Pheebs, ahem...

12:03.681 --> 12:06.224
- About your mom, heh.
- Yeah?

12:09.103 --> 12:10.937
How's that going?

12:11.105 --> 12:14.274
So great.
Oh, we took a nap together today.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.818
My mom fell asleep on my tummy
and purred.

12:19.196 --> 12:21.072
That's so sweet.

12:23.492 --> 12:25.076
I'm gonna get some coffee.

12:31.417 --> 12:34.502
Huh? What'd you say, Joe?
I'll be right there.

12:38.424 --> 12:41.259
- Pheebs...
- I just feel so...

12:41.427 --> 12:43.636
- All right.
- I'm coming already.

12:50.352 --> 12:52.645
Not yet, not yet, not yet.

12:59.111 --> 13:00.862
- Hello, Chip.
- Hey, Rach. How you doing?

13:01.030 --> 13:02.530
I'm great. I'm great.

13:02.698 --> 13:05.825
Got a great job at Bloomingdale's.
I have wonderful friends.

13:05.993 --> 13:07.952
And even though I'm not
seeing anyone right now...

13:08.120 --> 13:10.663
...I've really never felt better
about myself.

13:13.042 --> 13:14.584
So, uh, Monica ready yet?

13:18.047 --> 13:20.048
She'll be out in a second.

13:20.216 --> 13:23.301
So, Chip, how's, um, Amy Welsh?

13:23.469 --> 13:26.638
Amy Welsh?
Wow, I haven't seen her since...

13:28.974 --> 13:30.517
So, Monica about ready?

13:33.103 --> 13:35.563
This is the unit for you, my friend.

13:35.731 --> 13:38.608
Sturdy construction,
tons of storage compartments.

13:38.776 --> 13:41.027
Some big enough to fit a grown man.

13:41.862 --> 13:42.904
What?

13:43.072 --> 13:45.782
Oh, yeah, I got in there myself once.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.243
My roommate bet me 5 bucks
that I couldn't.

13:48.410 --> 13:50.912
And then he stuck a board
through the handles and locked me in.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.705
Ha, ha. Yeah.

13:52.873 --> 13:55.708
It was funny till I started feeling
like I was in a coffin.

13:57.878 --> 14:01.214
No, you... You can't fit in that thing.
That's not deep enough.

14:01.632 --> 14:03.216
Oh, yeah?

14:04.760 --> 14:06.761
If I can't...

14:06.929 --> 14:09.347
...I'll knock 5 bucks off the price
of the unit.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.766
- All right, you have yourself a deal.
- Okay.

14:16.689 --> 14:19.232
See? I told you.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.904
Sometimes I come in here
just to get away from it.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.950
Hey, a nickel.

14:33.414 --> 14:34.581
Here we are.

14:34.748 --> 14:36.833
Oh, my God, you still have the Chipper.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.501
The what?

14:38.669 --> 14:42.297
That's what we used to call
your, uh, motorcycle in high school.

14:42.464 --> 14:44.382
You know, a motorcycle's a chopper.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.467
And you're Chip.

14:47.011 --> 14:48.303
Never mind.

14:48.470 --> 14:50.972
No, I think it's cute.

14:55.102 --> 14:56.352
Wow.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.521
A lipper from the Chipper.

15:00.524 --> 15:02.775
So are you still in touch
with anyone from high school?

15:02.943 --> 15:05.153
Um, there's Rachel...

15:06.113 --> 15:08.239
...and that's it. How about you?

15:08.407 --> 15:10.617
Oh, yeah, I still hang
with Simens and Zana.

15:10.784 --> 15:13.661
You know, and I see Spindler a lot,
and Levine, Kelly.

15:13.829 --> 15:15.830
And I run into Goldie
from time to time...

15:16.206 --> 15:18.416
...Stick, Brown, Sulkov, McGuire...

15:18.584 --> 15:20.835
...J.T., Beardsley.

15:21.337 --> 15:22.462
Is that all?

15:22.630 --> 15:25.673
Ah, you know, after high school,
you just kind of lose touch.

15:27.217 --> 15:29.010
Oh, yeah, I ran into Richard Dorfman.

15:29.178 --> 15:30.678
- Oh, how is he?
- Not so good.

15:30.846 --> 15:33.306
Me and Simens gave him a wedgie.
Ha-ha-ha.

15:34.642 --> 15:37.310
- Isn't he an architect now?
- Yeah, they still wear underwear.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.367
Oh, my God.

15:55.037 --> 15:56.537
What?

15:58.832 --> 16:01.793
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

16:03.003 --> 16:04.837
What happened?

16:05.005 --> 16:08.967
Oh, man, he promised
he wouldn't take the chairs.

16:09.385 --> 16:11.511
What the hell happened?
How were you locked in there?

16:11.679 --> 16:14.055
Where the hell is all of our stuff?

16:14.431 --> 16:16.516
Well, this guy came by
to look at the unit...

16:16.684 --> 16:19.435
...and he said he didn't think
it was big enough to fit a grown man.

16:20.396 --> 16:22.730
So you got in voluntarily?

16:22.898 --> 16:25.608
I was trying to make a sale.

16:25.776 --> 16:29.112
Oh, man. If I ever run into that guy again,
you know what I'm gonna do?

16:29.279 --> 16:31.239
Bend over?

16:35.327 --> 16:38.871
And then Zana just let one rip.

16:43.919 --> 16:47.463
Look, not that I don't enjoy talking about
people who we went to high school with...

16:47.631 --> 16:49.674
- ...because I do.
- Ha, ha.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.176
But, um, maybe we can talk
about something else.

16:52.344 --> 16:54.721
Like you.
I don't even know where you work.

16:54.888 --> 16:57.306
- You know where I work.
- I do?

16:57.474 --> 17:00.393
The movie theater.
You used to come in all the time.

17:01.437 --> 17:05.940
- You still work at the Multiplex?
- Like I'd give up that job. Ha, ha.

17:06.108 --> 17:09.068
Free popcorn and candy
any time I want?

17:09.236 --> 17:11.945
- I can get you free posters for your room.
- Thanks, I'm set.

17:14.324 --> 17:15.575
Do you live with your parents?

17:15.742 --> 17:17.952
Yeah, but I can stay out as late as I want.

17:22.583 --> 17:26.377
Wow, they really got you guys.
Your TV, the chairs.

17:26.545 --> 17:29.297
Yeah, your microwave, the stereo.

17:29.465 --> 17:32.884
Oh, man, he took the five of spades.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.553
Oh, no, no, here it is.

17:37.765 --> 17:39.098
Oh, my God. What happened?

17:39.266 --> 17:43.936
Oh. Um, Joey was born, and then
28 years later, I was robbed.

17:47.983 --> 17:49.817
So how was your date?

17:49.985 --> 17:53.404
Well, you know how I always wanted
to go out with Chip in high school?

17:53.864 --> 17:57.825
Well, tonight, I actually went out
with Chip Matthews in high school.

17:58.619 --> 18:00.244
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

18:00.412 --> 18:03.331
No, it's okay. Not only did I get
to go out with Chip Matthews...

18:03.499 --> 18:05.291
...I got to dump Chip Matthews.

18:05.459 --> 18:08.336
- Oh, that's so great.
- I know.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.130
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:11.298 --> 18:13.299
So, uh,
what did the insurance company say?

18:13.467 --> 18:14.509
Oh, they said, uh:

18:14.676 --> 18:18.012
"You don't have insurance here,
so stop calling us."

18:21.600 --> 18:22.809
You didn't tell her?

18:26.605 --> 18:28.523
Okay, fine.

18:29.441 --> 18:30.817
- Pheebs?
- Yeah. Hi.

18:30.984 --> 18:34.112
Hi. Listen, uh...

18:34.571 --> 18:37.657
...this cat belongs to a little girl.

18:37.825 --> 18:41.119
All right?
There are flyers all over the place.

18:41.286 --> 18:43.496
I'm sorry, sweetie.

18:44.039 --> 18:46.749
Hey, we can take her
back with you if you want.

18:48.168 --> 18:50.586
Oh. Mm-hm.

18:50.754 --> 18:54.257
But, you know, she chose to find me.

18:54.424 --> 18:56.759
I mean, I have to respect her decision,
right?

18:58.554 --> 19:01.055
- That's a good call.
- That's right.

19:01.223 --> 19:03.808
No, no. Hey, enough is enough.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.394
Look, I'm sorry
that you feel guilty or whatever...

19:06.562 --> 19:10.106
...about spending time with your new mom.
But this is not your old mom.

19:10.274 --> 19:11.774
This is a cat. Okay?

19:11.942 --> 19:14.569
Julio the cat.

19:14.736 --> 19:16.612
Not Mom. Cat.

19:23.328 --> 19:24.579
It's okay.

19:25.581 --> 19:28.249
Ross, how many parents have you lost?

19:29.418 --> 19:30.751
None.

19:30.919 --> 19:34.630
Okay, then you don't know what it feels like
when one of them comes back. Do you?

19:39.136 --> 19:41.429
I believe this is my mother.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.931
Even if I'm wrong, who cares?

19:44.099 --> 19:47.560
Just be a friend, okay? Be supportive.

19:50.981 --> 19:52.148
I'm sorry.

19:53.275 --> 19:54.734
Okay.

19:56.403 --> 19:58.404
I don't know what to say. Heh.

20:01.158 --> 20:05.119
You could say you're sorry to her mom.

20:11.752 --> 20:13.920
I think she would like that.

20:24.973 --> 20:27.725
Come here. Here, come here, come here.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.687
Mrs. Buffay?

20:34.608 --> 20:36.317
Sorry about what I said.

20:36.485 --> 20:40.780
Um, it was insensitive of me to say...

20:40.948 --> 20:43.282
...that you were just a cat.

20:45.535 --> 20:50.831
When, clearly, you are also
the reincarnated spirit...

20:51.375 --> 20:52.458
...of my friend's mother.

20:55.545 --> 20:57.088
Thank you.

20:57.756 --> 20:59.757
- We both forgive you.
- Heh.

21:01.468 --> 21:03.427
What are you gonna do
about the little girl?

21:03.595 --> 21:06.347
Yeah. Okay, listen.

21:06.515 --> 21:10.851
Um, Mom, I hope you know
that you still mean a lot to me.

21:11.019 --> 21:13.604
And you're welcome
to come back any time.

21:13.981 --> 21:15.481
Pheebs?

21:15.649 --> 21:19.235
If she could come back as a couch,
we'd really appreciate it.

21:21.113 --> 21:22.780
Come on, Mom,
I'm gonna take you home.

21:22.948 --> 21:25.116
- I'll go with you.
- Me too.

21:26.368 --> 21:29.078
Oh, uh, you know, I got an extra futon.

21:29.705 --> 21:33.165
Dude, you don't have to brag.
We got nothing here.
