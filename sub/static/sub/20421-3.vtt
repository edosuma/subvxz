WEBVTT

00:11.800 --> 00:13.170
It's huge.

00:13.170 --> 00:17.370
When <i>Elder Tale</i> was still a game, 
we came here a lot, but...

00:17.720 --> 00:21.830
Yes, it looks quite different in person, my lord.

00:22.590 --> 00:26.540
This is the Depths of Palm...

02:03.850 --> 02:05.980
Reporting... No enemies in sight.

02:06.920 --> 02:08.600
Okay, let's go on ahead, Shiro.

02:08.880 --> 02:09.760
Right.

02:15.190 --> 02:21.120
<b>The Depths of Palm</b>

02:16.340 --> 02:17.870
The Depths of Palm.

02:21.900 --> 02:25.500
<i>It's been three days since we left 
Akihabara to save a girl named Serara,</i>

02:26.040 --> 02:27.580
<i>who'd been stranded in Susukino.</i>

02:32.260 --> 02:34.400
<i>Griffons come with usage restrictions.</i>

02:34.400 --> 02:37.090
<i>You can only ride them four hours a day.</i>

02:37.610 --> 02:41.850
<i>Even so, we've managed to travel a distance 
that would take two weeks by horse.</i>

02:43.290 --> 02:44.820
<i>The Tearstone Mountains...</i>

02:45.650 --> 02:47.250
My lord, look.

02:48.790 --> 02:49.690
Wyverns.

02:52.620 --> 02:54.770
Just like we thought, Shiro.

02:54.770 --> 02:55.650
Yeah.

02:55.650 --> 02:58.580
Monsters spawn in the same areas 
as they did when it was a game.

02:58.580 --> 03:00.200
We'll go underground as planned.

03:03.020 --> 03:05.600
The only way to reach Ezzo, 
where Susukino is located,

03:05.600 --> 03:08.500
is to go over these mountains, 
then cross the channel.

03:08.820 --> 03:11.320
Walking will take time, and it's dangerous.

03:11.730 --> 03:14.040
So we'll have to go underground.

03:12.020 --> 03:13.760
H-Hey, stop!

03:15.980 --> 03:16.830
It's huge.

03:17.580 --> 03:19.060
<i>The Depths of Palm.</i>

03:19.800 --> 03:22.800
<i>A complex maze of ancient 
tunnels and mine shafts.</i>

03:23.500 --> 03:26.620
<i>Once we're through, we'll be on the 
north side of the mountains.</i>

03:30.130 --> 03:34.690
This is way more impressive 
than it looked on a monitor.

03:37.220 --> 03:39.560
And it's so ancient, it's falling apart.

03:40.300 --> 03:42.930
It wasn't this way in the game...

03:44.230 --> 03:44.950
My lord!

03:50.130 --> 03:51.970
<i>The rat-men...</i>

03:52.480 --> 03:55.810
<i>One of this world's many demihuman types.</i>

03:56.290 --> 04:02.680
<b>Rat-man 
Rank/ Normal</b>

03:56.710 --> 04:00.280
They're low-level monsters, 
but they can spread plague.

04:00.810 --> 04:02.680
They aren't attacking.

04:03.370 --> 04:07.800
They instinctively know the differential 
between our levels, so we should be fine.

04:08.450 --> 04:11.890
But when cornered, they're dangerous.

04:11.890 --> 04:15.400
If we chase them anywhere narrow, 
or somewhere without an escape...

04:16.840 --> 04:18.110
If we do...

04:18.110 --> 04:20.320
They'll probably attack.

04:22.160 --> 04:23.630
Should we break through?

04:24.070 --> 04:25.690
I'd like to avoid wasting time fighting.

04:26.040 --> 04:28.050
And we don't want the plague debuff.

04:29.080 --> 04:30.650
Let's take another route.

04:30.650 --> 04:31.670
Yeah.

04:34.480 --> 04:36.550
This area seems safe.

04:37.310 --> 04:38.090
Yeah.

04:38.630 --> 04:41.370
My lord, I just scouted the floor ahead.

04:41.370 --> 04:42.470
Thanks.

04:42.820 --> 04:44.240
Could you tell me what you saw?

04:44.640 --> 04:46.220
I want to cross-reference with my map.

04:49.040 --> 04:50.230
You're being too formal.

04:50.860 --> 04:52.140
S-Sorry.

04:52.140 --> 04:54.560
Naotsugu, why don't you go ahead and... eat...

04:56.980 --> 05:00.030
This nasty food is the one thing 
I just can't get used to!

05:00.350 --> 05:01.980
Even when you cook it...

05:03.950 --> 05:06.310
It still ends up like this in a heartbeat.

05:06.670 --> 05:07.320
<i>Indeed...</i>

05:08.160 --> 05:11.080
<i>In this world, none of the food has any taste.</i>

05:28.260 --> 05:33.980

05:39.280 --> 05:42.440
Today's lunch was salty mush.

05:42.440 --> 05:45.580
Today's breakfast was sugary mush.

05:45.580 --> 05:49.270
Today's dinner is tasteless mush with an orange.

05:47.110 --> 05:50.180

06:11.950 --> 06:13.770
You told me your plan,

06:16.270 --> 06:19.930
Uh, that aside... How's it looking?

06:20.520 --> 06:21.650
Ah, right.

Yesterday, it was at level 42...

07:05.310 --> 07:10.650
Why did I pick such a minor, useless subclass?

07:11.420 --> 07:13.790
I should have chosen crafting,

09:16.350 --> 09:17.520
Be careful.

09:17.520 --> 09:18.910
Yes, talk to you later.

09:19.720 --> 09:22.740

By the way, how do you suppose Shiroe

09:37.850 --> 09:38.860
I don't know...

09:38.860 --> 09:41.770
He said something about figuring 
it out once he got there.

09:42.140 --> 09:45.230
He probably has some special plan.

09:45.230 --> 09:49.290
You can tell he was the Tea Party's strategist.

09:50.070 --> 09:54.890
But why would someone like 
that refuse to join a guild?

09:54.890 --> 09:57.530
I'm sure he has his reasons.

09:58.070 --> 09:59.700
Um, excuse me.

10:14.090 --> 10:15.670
Thirty percent refused.

10:15.930 --> 10:20.010

Ichimonjinosuke Akaneya, from Radio Market.

10:32.230 --> 10:35.660
It seems that they and several 
masters of the smaller guilds

10:35.660 --> 10:39.070
have gathered in the Crescent Moon Alliance's hall.

14:09.030 --> 14:10.270
Shiro?

14:10.270 --> 14:11.780
What's wrong, Shiro?

14:12.970 --> 14:14.040
My lord!

14:14.040 --> 14:14.740
Shiro!

14:15.450 --> 14:16.550
My lord!

14:19.720 --> 14:20.810
Are you awake?

14:20.810 --> 14:22.290
Are you all right, my lord?

14:23.750 --> 14:24.860
Where am I?

14:24.860 --> 14:26.300
Thank the shrimp.

14:26.300 --> 14:30.700
After you fell, she jumped in and saved you.

14:31.200 --> 14:34.570
You also jumped in, and pulled us both up.

14:34.570 --> 14:36.260
And don't call me a shrimp!

14:36.700 --> 14:37.560
I see.

14:38.220 --> 14:41.050
Thanks, Naotsugu... And Akatsuki.

14:41.950 --> 14:44.570
Me, too... I mean...

14:46.180 --> 14:47.570
Thank you.

14:47.870 --> 14:49.010
Eh? For what?

14:49.480 --> 14:52.400
You tried to save me...

14:53.850 --> 14:56.960
Okay, let's get this adventure 
back on the road!

14:57.230 --> 14:57.790
Right.

14:58.480 --> 15:02.680
Weird, though. I fell into the 
water from that height,

15:02.680 --> 15:05.430
but I'm barely hurt, and I'm not cold.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.810
Maybe because your body's level 90?

15:11.690 --> 15:14.780
After all this walking, I'm hardly tired at all.

15:15.940 --> 15:18.170
So where are we now?

15:18.480 --> 15:20.980
We ended up taking the long way, 
but we're nearly out.

15:21.270 --> 15:24.300
You really are good at cartography, my lord.

15:24.820 --> 15:26.890
My subclass is scribe, after all.

15:26.890 --> 15:30.060
And back in the other world, I did CAD work.

15:30.060 --> 15:31.740
Come to think of it, that's true.

15:32.120 --> 15:32.960
CAD?

15:33.530 --> 15:34.790
What's CAD?

15:35.250 --> 15:36.950
Designs you make on a computer.

15:36.950 --> 15:39.230
I do it at my university. 
I'm an engineering student.

15:39.670 --> 15:41.290
So you're a college student.

15:41.920 --> 15:43.270
A graduate student.

15:43.270 --> 15:44.840
I'm about to graduate...

15:44.840 --> 15:46.270
Or I was.

15:46.270 --> 15:47.210
Oh.

15:47.650 --> 15:50.720
Then you're basically the same age as I am.

15:55.110 --> 15:56.630
Seriously?

15:57.650 --> 15:59.020
Is it that surprising?

15:59.280 --> 16:00.560
You're kidding, right?

16:00.560 --> 16:02.520
I mean, you're totally a little kid—

16:05.050 --> 16:08.570
My lord, may I kick this stupid Naotsugu?

16:05.470 --> 16:07.020
She's in college?

16:08.890 --> 16:11.990
I've told you, ask <i>before</i> you do that!

16:12.390 --> 16:15.360
It's your fault for being rude and perverted.

16:15.820 --> 16:18.700
Perverted? You mean like b—

16:21.150 --> 16:22.990
My lord, may I take this pervert and...

16:22.990 --> 16:26.630
Again? At least let me get another letter in!

16:26.630 --> 16:28.630
Akatsuki, Naotsugu's going to cry.

16:30.010 --> 16:34.470
My lord, did you also think I was a child?

16:34.690 --> 16:37.640
N-No, I wouldn't say "child"...

16:38.340 --> 16:39.480
<i>How do I answer this?</i>

16:43.690 --> 16:44.840
<i>A kid, huh?</i>

16:49.310 --> 16:51.530
<i>It looked like they joined some guild.</i>

16:51.940 --> 16:53.420
<i>I wonder if they're okay.</i>

16:54.270 --> 16:56.060
<i>When I'm back in Akihabara, 
maybe I'll find them and...</i>

16:56.060 --> 16:58.950
What are you thinking about, my lord?

16:59.640 --> 17:01.430
Nothing, really.

17:02.010 --> 17:03.580
That isn't true.

17:03.580 --> 17:06.760
Whenever you're thinking, your brow furrows.

17:07.530 --> 17:08.600
Right here.

17:08.600 --> 17:10.310
You look like an old man.

17:13.290 --> 17:15.060
What are you laughing at?

17:15.060 --> 17:17.060
Well... You heard her!

17:17.060 --> 17:18.440
Naotsugu!

17:22.250 --> 17:24.190
Where did this come from?

17:24.590 --> 17:25.540
Lag?

17:26.210 --> 17:29.300
No, we switched zones.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.090
My lord, above us!

17:31.580 --> 17:32.790
What is that thing?

17:32.790 --> 17:35.230
It's blocking the stairs...

17:35.230 --> 17:36.700
Was that in the game?

17:37.300 --> 17:39.010
A subspecies of rat-man?

17:39.830 --> 17:41.320
Doesn't seem to have a specific name.

17:41.900 --> 17:43.200
Which means...

17:43.520 --> 17:47.110
It's one of the new Novasphere monsters?

17:47.110 --> 17:50.290
It's huge, but it's level 68.

17:48.210 --> 17:50.290
<b>Rat-maso 
Rank/ Party</b>

17:50.800 --> 17:53.230
Looks like it's mostly status debuffs.

17:53.690 --> 17:56.400
Is it the reason the dungeon's falling apart?

17:56.400 --> 17:57.270
Probably.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.560
It's a little risky, but we have no choice.

18:00.590 --> 18:01.640
Let's eliminate it.

18:02.450 --> 18:03.300
Okay!

18:03.300 --> 18:05.640
Let's make this quick, strategist.

18:05.830 --> 18:08.190
Over here, big boy!

18:12.380 --> 18:13.740
<i>Stealth Blade!</i>

18:15.780 --> 18:17.520
<i>Cross Slash!</i>

18:17.520 --> 18:22.040
<b>In Combat 
Naotsugu Akatsuki</b>

18:18.450 --> 18:20.680
No matter how used to it you are,

18:20.680 --> 18:22.370
fighting in real life is different.

18:23.080 --> 18:28.040
You can't apprehend size, breath, 
or stink through a monitor!

18:28.540 --> 18:29.210
Here I go!

18:32.710 --> 18:34.260
<i>Thorn Bind Hostage!</i>

18:42.040 --> 18:43.300
Its defense is pretty high.

18:43.720 --> 18:46.940
Three left... Get it, shrimp!

18:47.310 --> 18:48.810
Don't call me shrimp!

18:52.000 --> 18:53.300
I'll ensure you don't miss.

18:53.990 --> 18:54.820
<i>Mind Shock!</i>

18:58.650 --> 19:04.510
<i>First you add a confusion debuff 
that lowers dodge and agility.</i>

19:05.810 --> 19:08.960
<i>Then amplify the attack power 
of your allies' weapons.</i>

19:10.140 --> 19:11.170
<i>Keen Edge!</i>

19:12.790 --> 19:14.310
Thank you, my lord!

19:15.310 --> 19:17.590
Now it'll only take one more hit.

19:21.230 --> 19:22.550
<i>Assassinate.</i>

19:22.640 --> 19:24.100
<b>Death</b>

19:47.790 --> 19:48.850
Wow.

19:49.420 --> 19:50.660
The wind is cold.

19:51.140 --> 19:52.730
But it feels great!

19:53.580 --> 19:57.130
We're finally through the tough part.

19:58.720 --> 19:59.920
It's beautiful.

19:59.920 --> 20:01.130
Amazing.

20:04.020 --> 20:07.140
The best part of adventuring 
is experiencing new things!

20:10.550 --> 20:12.530
<i>New things, huh?</i>

20:13.720 --> 20:16.090
When <i>Elder Tale</i> was a game,

20:16.090 --> 20:20.030
lots of players passed by here at dawn.

20:22.820 --> 20:23.910
But...

20:25.030 --> 20:26.770
We're the first ones here.

20:28.290 --> 20:31.290
We're the first adventurers in the world

20:32.130 --> 20:34.220
to see this.

20:39.590 --> 20:40.300
That's right.

20:41.210 --> 20:45.260
I've never seen anything so amazing, 
even in <i>Elder Tale</i>.

20:45.950 --> 20:49.350
It's our first prize for victory.

20:57.480 --> 21:00.880
Sorry... There's no escaping Susukino!

21:00.880 --> 21:03.850
How many times have you tried? 
Get a clue already!

21:03.850 --> 21:05.120
N-No—

21:05.800 --> 21:08.360
That was a big wagon, but there isn't much inside.

21:08.360 --> 21:10.260
Hey, why are you just standing there?

21:10.260 --> 21:11.480
Pick stuff up.

21:12.130 --> 21:14.670
I don't think I can do this...

21:14.670 --> 21:17.980
Then you're headed for the Cathedral.

21:18.820 --> 21:19.810
Demikas?

21:23.780 --> 21:28.420
It's just a game... It's all virtual.

21:28.420 --> 21:30.070
They'll just come back to life.

21:30.070 --> 21:33.310
If you're still freaking out over PKing, 
something's wrong with you.

21:33.710 --> 21:37.540
Hey, don't forget to strip his equipment 
before he disappears.

21:37.540 --> 21:38.820
Right!

21:41.100 --> 21:42.540
Don't drop that.

21:42.540 --> 21:44.360
Keep a tight grip on it, Person of the Land.

21:44.360 --> 21:45.620
What a riot!

21:46.470 --> 21:48.280
Hey, I found some more.

21:48.280 --> 21:51.080
Did those players back there hire them?

21:52.240 --> 21:54.960
Even non-player characters cry?

21:54.960 --> 21:57.210
Was that part of the game?

21:57.210 --> 21:58.960
I don't care.

21:58.960 --> 22:01.110
Do we take them, guild master?

22:01.650 --> 22:02.920
I don't care.

22:03.450 --> 22:05.760
I don't care if they're People of the Land or not.

22:05.760 --> 22:07.340
They bore me.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.440
So, Londark...

22:10.290 --> 22:12.850
Where are the cat and the girl?

22:13.130 --> 22:15.770
I have men looking for them, but nothing yet.

22:17.960 --> 22:20.220
Why are you still fooling around?!

22:20.220 --> 22:22.710
Find the girl and the cat!

22:22.710 --> 22:23.740
Y-Yes, sir!

22:24.690 --> 22:27.040
This is my world.

22:27.040 --> 22:29.740
I won't allow anything to go against my will.

22:30.970 --> 22:34.380
Just wait, Serara!

24:05.610 --> 24:09.600
Brigandia, a guild that runs Susukino via force.

24:09.600 --> 24:12.780
Its guild master, Demikas, rules by fear.

24:13.200 --> 24:17.270
Shiroe's party meets with Serara, 
and tries to escape them.

24:17.830 --> 24:19.760
What strategy does Shiroe have?

24:19.760 --> 24:22.950
And what does Akatsuki see during the battle?

24:23.400 --> 24:25.140
Next time: Escape.

24:23.400 --> 24:29.990
<b>Escape</b>

24:25.140 --> 24:27.250
This is our reality.
