But you know, a lot has changed
in the past six months.

03:44.069 --> 03:47.129
For instance, we no longer use
language to communicate.

03:47.129 --> 03:49.199
We only use emojis.

03:49.199 --> 03:53.599
In fact, I actually have
some educational flash cards

and who are you?"

Good night."

09:11.230 --> 09:13.429
- Oh, thank you.

09:13.429 --> 09:15.330
- Wow,
have you always done this

09:15.330 --> 09:16.870
with Penn and Teller
or is it just--

09:16.870 --> 09:17.929
- You know what,
this is a one-time thing.

09:17.929 --> 09:19.470
It's the only time
I'm gonna do this.

09:19.470 --> 09:21.929
So I actually build
the puppets myself, so...

09:21.929 --> 09:24.169
- They're absolutely
incredible.

09:24.169 --> 09:25.629
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

09:25.629 --> 09:27.730
So where did you come up
with this idea?

09:27.730 --> 09:30.399
- Well, I thought, you know,
what would be a neat idea

09:30.399 --> 09:32.669
to be able to mix puppetry
and magic and--

09:32.669 --> 09:34.500
- Fake blood.
- Yeah, and fake blood.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.730
Yeah, so I thought, you know,
what better place to do it

09:36.730 --> 09:38.269
than here, right?
- Nice.

09:38.269 --> 09:40.370
So you've given yourself
quite a challenge

09:40.370 --> 09:42.370
to do ventri--
[chuckles]

09:42.370 --> 09:43.730
Can you help me say that word?

09:43.730 --> 09:45.570
- Yeah, I have a hard time
with it too sometimes.

09:45.570 --> 09:46.899
- Ventriloquism
and magic together.

09:46.899 --> 09:47.970
- That's--that's right,
I thought it'd be

09:47.970 --> 09:49.129
kind of a neat challenge to,

09:49.129 --> 09:51.399
you know, see what--
what I could come up with.

09:51.399 --> 09:53.470
- Can you teach me how
to be a ventriloquist?

09:53.470 --> 09:55.299
- [laughs]
- Or say "ventriloquist"?

09:55.299 --> 09:57.330
'Cause I'm having
struggles with that.

09:57.330 --> 10:00.269
- Well, I say that the secret
to being a ventriloquist

10:00.269 --> 10:03.029
is basically practicing
in front of a mirror

10:03.029 --> 10:04.769
trying to talk without
moving your lips.

10:04.769 --> 10:07.370
And, you know--
and then from there,

10:07.370 --> 10:10.370
you know, holding on
to a sock and...

10:10.370 --> 10:11.629
- So you started with the sock

10:11.629 --> 10:12.929
and now you have
Penn and Teller.

10:12.929 --> 10:14.830
- That's right. Yeah.
- Wow. All right.

10:14.830 --> 10:16.600
Well, let's see
if Penn and Teller

10:16.600 --> 10:18.169
have a handle
on how you did it.

10:18.169 --> 10:19.299
- All right.
- All right.

10:19.299 --> 10:20.700
Penn, Teller.

10:20.700 --> 10:22.169
- Which ones?

10:22.169 --> 10:24.399
- Present day.
- Boy.

10:24.399 --> 10:26.230
Could not be more flattering.

10:26.230 --> 10:28.000
- [laughing]
- It's just...

10:28.000 --> 10:29.600
No, no,
I mean that sincerely.

10:29.600 --> 10:31.629
I'm saying that, boy,
to have someone

10:31.629 --> 10:33.470
go to all that work,
it's stunning

10:33.470 --> 10:35.570
and--and very humbling.
- Oh, thank you.

10:35.570 --> 10:38.029
- You know, when they
rate variety acts,

10:38.029 --> 10:39.899
ventriloquists are
always down there

10:39.899 --> 10:41.600
near the bottom
with magicians.

10:41.600 --> 10:42.899
- Yeah, yeah.

10:42.899 --> 10:44.870
- But it's, you know,
it's usually

10:44.870 --> 10:48.629
mimes, balloon animals,
ventriloquists,

10:48.629 --> 10:50.299
hypnotists, you know.

10:50.299 --> 10:52.230
- I think ventriloquist is
actually a little bit lower--

10:52.230 --> 10:53.870
much lower than--
- Not hypnotist.

10:53.870 --> 10:55.500
Hypnotists are
the absolute rock bottom.

10:55.500 --> 10:56.700
- [laughs]

10:56.700 --> 10:59.070
- But if we're forced
to put a ranking on them,

10:59.070 --> 11:00.330
I think we've done that.

11:00.330 --> 11:02.529
But, boy, we're just flattered
and just loved it.

11:02.529 --> 11:04.129
And I actually love vent acts,

11:04.129 --> 11:08.370
and I--I can't believe there's
actually a puppet of me

11:08.370 --> 11:10.429
and a puppet of me that'll
be useful forever

11:10.429 --> 11:12.299
because I'll grow into it.

11:12.299 --> 11:14.029
[laughter]

11:14.029 --> 11:16.129

given you enough there

11:16.129 --> 11:17.269
as we were talking, didn't we?

11:17.269 --> 11:20.070
- From what you were saying
that you--you

11:20.070 --> 11:22.399
assumed that I forced...
[laughs]

11:22.399 --> 11:23.929
The umbrella--
- Yeah. Yeah.

11:23.929 --> 11:26.129
- I--there's no force
involved.

11:26.129 --> 11:27.629
- There's no force at all?

11:27.629 --> 11:29.600
Now, did the--
- No.

11:29.600 --> 11:31.100
It was a free choice

11:31.100 --> 11:32.799
and it could have been
any one of the emojis

11:32.799 --> 11:34.669
that was chosen and
any one of 'em could have

11:34.669 --> 11:35.899
appeared on the cloth.

11:35.899 --> 11:37.929
- So that means...

11:37.929 --> 11:39.470
- I guess that means
you fooled us.

11:39.470 --> 11:41.799
- Yay!

16:57.470 --> 17:01.070
All you need to do
is just tape it...

17:01.070 --> 17:02.470
on ace of diamonds like this.

17:02.470 --> 17:03.770
Because of the design
of the stickers,

17:03.770 --> 17:04.929
it actually creates

17:04.929 --> 17:07.669
a very special
optical illusion.

17:07.669 --> 17:09.230
Because it looks like
the back of the card,

17:09.230 --> 17:10.368
right, the stickers.

17:10.368 --> 17:12.669
Once it's placed on top
of the deck,

17:12.669 --> 17:14.829
it looks like there's a hole

17:14.829 --> 17:17.398
on the ace of diamonds, right.

17:17.398 --> 17:20.069
But because this is
a imaginary deck,

17:20.069 --> 17:21.800
once you think
it's a reality...

17:21.800 --> 17:22.800
[fingers snap]

17:22.800 --> 17:25.169
It becomes...

17:25.169 --> 17:26.569
the reality.

17:28.270 --> 17:30.000
[applause]

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
And now let's try this
one more time.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.669
If you have a good imagination,

17:33.669 --> 17:35.469
you don't even need
to use the stickers.

17:35.469 --> 17:39.030
And let's try this with
the six of clubs here.

17:39.030 --> 17:41.300
Just imagine the six of clubs
has a hole

17:41.300 --> 17:43.369
like the ace of diamonds.

17:43.369 --> 17:45.000
Just by merely
thinking about it

17:45.000 --> 17:46.899
will be enough...

17:46.899 --> 17:49.030
to change...

17:49.030 --> 17:50.699
the reality.

17:50.699 --> 17:53.000
[applause]

17:53.000 --> 17:55.830
And if we all think
about it together,

17:55.830 --> 17:59.169
we can even extend this

17:59.169 --> 18:02.169
to the entire...

18:02.169 --> 18:04.429
pack.

18:04.429 --> 18:08.230
[cheers and applause]

18:08.230 --> 18:12.770
But remember all of those
are just your imagination.

18:12.770 --> 18:15.300
A moment ago, those were not
even playing cards.

18:15.300 --> 18:17.500
Those were just some blank
pieces of paper, right.

18:17.500 --> 18:20.369
And once you stop thinking,

18:20.369 --> 18:23.530
they'll actually change back...

18:23.530 --> 18:25.230
To blank.

18:25.230 --> 18:27.969
Not just one,
not just two,

18:27.969 --> 18:30.730
but every single one of them

18:30.730 --> 18:33.730
will go back to blank.

18:33.730 --> 18:35.300
[cheers and applause]

18:35.300 --> 18:38.600
Except for one and only one.

18:38.600 --> 18:40.300
The ace of diamonds
on the table.

18:40.300 --> 18:41.830
But just like the other,

18:41.830 --> 18:43.730
this is nothing

18:43.730 --> 18:46.169
but your imagination.

18:46.169 --> 18:48.899
So if you stop
thinking about it...

18:50.100 --> 18:51.369
You can actually see
the ace of diamonds

18:51.369 --> 18:53.070
slowly...

18:56.770 --> 18:58.129
Disappear.

18:58.129 --> 18:59.699
Because from
the very beginning,

18:59.699 --> 19:01.230
there were only two things:

19:01.230 --> 19:02.969
your imagination

19:02.969 --> 19:07.399
and a piece of paper.

19:07.399 --> 19:09.300
[cheers and applause]

19:09.300 --> 19:12.899
- Kelvin Chow!

19:12.899 --> 19:14.969
Whoo.
- Thank you.

19:14.969 --> 19:16.169
- That was incredible.

19:16.169 --> 19:18.100
- Thank you.
Thank you, Alyson.

19:18.100 --> 19:19.629
- I'm so impressed.
- Thank you.

19:19.629 --> 19:21.330
- How long have you
been doing magic?

19:21.330 --> 19:22.629
- Me too.
- Ah, good.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.169
You should be.
- Yes.

19:24.169 --> 19:27.129
A really long time, about,
like, ten plus year.

19:27.129 --> 19:28.469
I lost count.
- Wow.

19:28.469 --> 19:30.429
Do you perform in Hong Kong?
- A little bit.

19:30.429 --> 19:31.899
I'm not a professional,
but sometimes

19:31.899 --> 19:33.770
I get to do shows in Hong Kong.

19:33.770 --> 19:35.730
- Oh, really?
I feel like this'll

19:35.730 --> 19:37.869
help you, right?
- Yes, certainly.

19:37.869 --> 19:39.570
Certainly it would.
- Yeah.

19:39.570 --> 19:43.330
- Thank you, everyone.
[applause]

19:43.330 --> 19:45.629
- And so what else do you do?

19:45.629 --> 19:47.730
- Uh, that's the problem
with most magician.

19:47.730 --> 19:49.830
We don't do much else
beside magic.

19:49.830 --> 19:52.270
[laughter]

19:52.270 --> 19:53.770
- Well, they're writing a lot.

19:53.770 --> 19:55.199
They're not talking
to each other.

19:55.199 --> 19:56.369
They're just writing.
- Hmm.

19:56.369 --> 19:57.669
- What do you think?

19:57.669 --> 19:59.030
- I don't know.

19:59.030 --> 20:00.429
I did a bunch of tricks,

20:00.429 --> 20:01.830
and that's my strategy.

20:01.830 --> 20:03.899
There's like
whole bunch of them.

20:03.899 --> 20:05.469
I don't know how many of them
they could see through.

20:05.469 --> 20:07.300
- So, how many
tricks were there?

20:07.300 --> 20:09.270
Can you tell me that?
- Oh, wow.

20:09.270 --> 20:11.429
I lost count myself.
- All right.

20:11.429 --> 20:13.129
Let's see if Penn and Teller
can figure out

20:13.129 --> 20:14.699
how you did all those tricks.

20:14.699 --> 20:17.199
- Absolutely.
- All right, Penn, Teller.

20:17.199 --> 20:19.270
- Yeah, there's
so many tricks in there

20:19.270 --> 20:20.629
that you couldn't count 'em,
right?

20:20.629 --> 20:22.369
- [laughs] Yes. Yes.
- That what you said?

20:22.369 --> 20:23.830
There's a lot of tricks,

20:23.830 --> 20:25.469
and there's a lot of skill

20:25.469 --> 20:27.629
and just crazy amounts
of practice.

20:27.629 --> 20:29.000
I mean, just acrobatic,

20:29.000 --> 20:31.699
just amazing, amazing
stuff going on.

20:31.699 --> 20:35.030
And also I loved
the fact that there's a--

20:35.030 --> 20:36.969
there's a plot
other than find a card.

20:36.969 --> 20:38.369
You know?
- Oh.

20:38.369 --> 20:39.929
- There's nothing more powerful

20:39.929 --> 20:42.129
than just telling someone
to name a card

20:42.129 --> 20:44.530
and then being able
to do miracles with that.

20:44.530 --> 20:46.600
'Cause if you really had
magical powers,

20:46.600 --> 20:48.730
you wouldn't say,
"Pick a card," to get one,

20:48.730 --> 20:50.129
you'd say, "Name one."

20:50.129 --> 20:51.500
And you did that,

20:51.500 --> 20:54.230
and then all the stuff
is so visual

20:54.230 --> 20:56.429
and pretty
and really, really nice.

20:56.429 --> 20:59.500
I like the fact
that it's a visceral act

20:59.500 --> 21:02.399
and you get the audience
gasping and doing stuff.

21:02.399 --> 21:05.369
And there are so many things
on our notes

21:05.369 --> 21:08.230
and there were
so many puns and names

21:08.230 --> 21:09.869
we'd have to reference.
- Oh.

21:09.869 --> 21:11.899
- That I can't do it.
There's a zillion things.

21:11.899 --> 21:14.330
So Teller has written down
a few things

21:14.330 --> 21:15.629
that might--
- Sure.

21:15.629 --> 21:17.429
- Might enlighten you
as to what we thought.

21:17.429 --> 21:18.869
- [laughs]

21:20.129 --> 21:21.699
Oh, wow.

21:21.699 --> 21:23.669
The secret notebook.

21:23.669 --> 21:25.330
- That's just Teller
writing out

21:25.330 --> 21:27.330
that he's offering him money
if he backs down.

21:27.330 --> 21:28.469
[laughter]

21:28.469 --> 21:29.629
- Pretty much.

21:29.629 --> 21:30.929
Pretty much it.

21:30.929 --> 21:32.330
[laughter]

21:32.330 --> 21:34.300
- So did Teller give you
enough information?

21:34.300 --> 21:35.629
Do they know how it was done?

21:35.629 --> 21:37.300
- Yes. Yes. They did.
Definitely.

21:37.300 --> 21:40.830
- Aw. Okay, well, thank you.
Kelvin Chow!

21:40.830 --> 21:42.830
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Thank you.

21:45.169 --> 21:46.699

Good evening.
Wow.

23:05.080 --> 23:08.120
My name is Joshua,
and I'm here right now

23:08.120 --> 23:11.350
because of something
Albert Einstein said.

23:11.350 --> 23:15.179
"The most beautiful thing
we can experience

23:15.179 --> 23:17.519
is the mysterious."

23:17.519 --> 23:20.320
So I brought something
mysterious with me.

23:23.380 --> 23:25.550
This little wooden box,

23:25.550 --> 23:27.219
and it is for Alyson.

23:27.219 --> 23:28.419
Would you join me over here?

23:35.650 --> 23:37.749
- Alyson, you and I get
to play a game together.

23:37.749 --> 23:39.719
- How exciting. Thanks
- I know.

23:39.719 --> 23:41.280
But first,

23:41.280 --> 23:43.350
would you like to know what
is in your mysterious box?

23:43.350 --> 23:45.050
- Yes.
- No.

23:45.050 --> 23:46.620
- No. No.
- No.

23:46.620 --> 23:47.919
- 'Cause it would spoil
the mystery.

23:47.919 --> 23:49.419
- Oh, true.
- Exactly.

23:49.419 --> 23:51.120
- I'll give you a hint.
- Okay.

23:51.120 --> 23:52.620
- In this box

23:52.620 --> 23:54.449
is an animal.
- Ooh.

23:54.449 --> 23:56.979
- Here you go.
[light laughter]

23:56.979 --> 23:58.780
In 3 1/2 minutes,

23:58.780 --> 24:01.080

24:04.280 --> 24:05.350
How?

24:05.350 --> 24:06.580
I'm gonna communicate
it to you,

24:06.580 --> 24:07.880
but it'll be subtle.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.280
If it works,

24:09.280 --> 24:11.280
you won't even be consciously
aware it's happening.

24:11.280 --> 24:13.219
But subconsciously,
folks,

24:13.219 --> 24:16.919
Alyson will find herself
being "moo-ved"

24:16.919 --> 24:18.320
to name one animal.
- Hmm.

24:18.320 --> 24:19.850
- I'll--no.

24:19.850 --> 24:21.280
Won't be that obvious.
I'm horsing around.

24:21.280 --> 24:22.719
No.
- [laughs]

24:22.719 --> 24:24.280
Forget I said anything.
Let's play our little game.

24:24.280 --> 24:25.650
- Okay.

24:25.650 --> 24:27.550
- I'm gonna give you
a famous phrase

24:27.550 --> 24:28.979
and then you will complete it.

24:28.979 --> 24:30.719
So if I said the itsy-bitsy,

24:30.719 --> 24:32.280
audience, Alyson would say...

24:32.280 --> 24:33.679
audience: Spider.

24:33.679 --> 24:35.350
- No.
- [laughs]

24:35.350 --> 24:37.679
- In this game, Alyson,
you get to say anything

24:37.679 --> 24:40.679
you want other than
what is expected of you.

24:40.679 --> 24:41.880
- Ooh. Okay.
- Anything.

24:41.880 --> 24:43.449
- So you might say
the itsy-bitsy...

24:43.449 --> 24:44.580
- Elephant.

24:44.580 --> 24:45.949
- Perfect.
Exactly, you get the game.

24:45.949 --> 24:46.949
Okay.
- Okay.

24:46.949 --> 24:48.150
- So looking right at me.

24:48.150 --> 24:49.620
Nice and relaxed.
I should also mention

24:49.620 --> 24:51.679
that the answers you give
will tell us all

24:51.679 --> 24:53.179
a lot about you at a very
deep, personal level.

24:53.179 --> 24:54.949
- [laughs] No pressure.
- And go.

- It's fine. Yeah.

No.

25:09.479 --> 25:10.749
- Last one.
- I'm trying to rhyme.

25:10.749 --> 25:12.150
- This is your chance.
That's right, it's okay.

25:12.150 --> 25:13.749
No. No. No. It's--
this is your last one. Ready?

25:13.749 --> 25:15.449
- Yeah, okay, so it
has to be an animal?

25:15.449 --> 25:16.679
- No, it doesn't have
to be an animal.

25:16.679 --> 25:17.979
It gets to be whatever
you want it to be.

25:17.979 --> 25:19.550
- Oh, good. Great.
- Final one.

25:19.550 --> 25:20.880
- Okay.
- He wouldn't hurt a...

25:20.880 --> 25:22.419
- Squirrel!

25:22.419 --> 25:23.650
[laughter]

25:23.650 --> 25:25.050
- [laughs]
- Wouldn't hurt a squirrel.

25:25.050 --> 25:26.820
Very nice.

25:26.820 --> 25:30.380
[cheers and applause]

25:30.380 --> 25:32.380
[Penn laughing]
So, first off,

25:32.380 --> 25:33.620
you're a very interesting
person.

25:33.620 --> 25:34.719
- [laughs]

25:34.719 --> 25:35.780
- So that was harder
than you thought

25:35.780 --> 25:37.749
it was gonna be, right?
- Yes!

25:37.749 --> 25:39.719
- 'Cause you had to let go
of years of expectations

25:39.719 --> 25:41.249
and then trust
your own instincts.

25:41.249 --> 25:42.320
- Totally.

25:42.320 --> 25:44.050
- Also, something else
happened,

25:44.050 --> 25:45.179
which I think
some of the audience

25:45.179 --> 25:46.780
probably picked up on.

25:46.780 --> 25:49.179
I communicated
some information to you

25:49.179 --> 25:50.780
with the words that I'm using,

25:50.780 --> 25:52.019
some of my gestures,

25:52.019 --> 25:53.979
and other very
subtle techniques.

25:53.979 --> 25:56.380
Can we get the easel
out here please?

25:56.380 --> 25:58.350
[laughter]

25:58.350 --> 26:00.850
And also the board.

26:00.850 --> 26:02.320
- Thanks, buddy.

26:02.320 --> 26:04.620
Oh, hi. All right.
- All right.

26:04.620 --> 26:06.050
[laughter]

26:06.050 --> 26:07.850
Excellent.
Thank you, fellas.

26:07.850 --> 26:09.380
- Did he just have
that lion around?

26:09.380 --> 26:10.519
- Ahh!
- Ah!

26:10.519 --> 26:12.419
- See, you can do this.
You can do this.

26:12.419 --> 26:13.679
- Sure.

26:13.679 --> 26:16.380
[applause]

26:16.380 --> 26:18.820
- Alyson, one of these animals

26:18.820 --> 26:20.979
is in that box.
- Ah.

26:20.979 --> 26:23.519
- If I ask you to pick one
right now, you could.

26:23.519 --> 26:25.080
You'd likely be wrong.
- Okay.

26:25.080 --> 26:26.949
- Why?
Because you'd be guessing.

26:26.949 --> 26:28.979
- Yes.
- You don't have to guess.

26:28.979 --> 26:30.179
If everything
we've done

26:30.179 --> 26:31.880
in the last few minutes
has worked,

26:31.880 --> 26:33.780
you know

26:33.780 --> 26:35.580
which animal is
written down in there,

26:35.580 --> 26:37.280
even if you don't know
that you know.

26:37.280 --> 26:38.479
- Oh.

26:38.479 --> 26:40.479
- So I'm gonna help you
trust your instincts

26:40.479 --> 26:43.479
one more time.

26:43.479 --> 26:44.919
You can forget
all the jokes.

26:44.919 --> 26:47.979
Let go of all
expectations.

26:47.979 --> 26:49.749
Look over your options.
- Okay.

26:49.749 --> 26:51.249
- And when I say, "Now,"

26:51.249 --> 26:53.380
call out the one that feels
right to you at this moment.

26:53.380 --> 26:55.719
You know it.
- [grunts]

26:55.719 --> 26:58.019
- In five--
trust yourself--

26:58.019 --> 26:59.120
four...

26:59.120 --> 27:00.650
Now!
- Duck!

27:00.650 --> 27:01.850
[laughter]

27:01.850 --> 27:03.380
- Again, the one
in the box is...

27:03.380 --> 27:04.979
- Duck.

27:05.919 --> 27:07.219
- Open it up there.

27:07.219 --> 27:08.949
There's a little clasp
in the front.

27:08.949 --> 27:11.120
Does it say "duck" inside
of the box?

27:11.120 --> 27:13.679
- It says, "For Alyson."
- It says, "For Alyson,"

27:13.679 --> 27:17.749
because this was always
meant to be for you.

27:17.749 --> 27:20.320
Inside there is an envelope.

27:20.320 --> 27:22.080
Yes, just one.
- Yeah.

27:22.080 --> 27:24.479
- Sealed envelope.
- Yeah.

27:24.479 --> 27:26.120
- Inside of there--
you can open it up--

27:26.120 --> 27:27.650
there's one slip of paper.

27:27.650 --> 27:28.919
Is there only one in there?

27:28.919 --> 27:30.749
Yep, hold it up, make sure.
- Yeah. [gasps]

27:30.749 --> 27:32.350
- And show everybody
how amazing you did.

27:32.350 --> 27:34.350
You got it!
[cheers and applause]

27:34.350 --> 27:36.850
You're so good.
Alyson, ladies and gentlemen.

27:36.850 --> 27:37.880
- Ah.

27:37.880 --> 27:39.919
Joshua Lozoff!

27:39.919 --> 27:41.650
[sighs]
That was so much fun.

27:41.650 --> 27:43.320
- It is.
- That was awesome.

27:43.320 --> 27:44.620
- Thank you.
You did great.

27:44.620 --> 27:46.150
- Yay, so did you.
- Oh, thank you.

27:46.150 --> 27:47.850
- Yay.
I didn't realize how hard

27:47.850 --> 27:49.320
the itsy-bitsy part
would be.

27:49.320 --> 27:50.749
- I know, it's like
everybody thinks--

27:50.749 --> 27:53.249
but your mind has
so many preconceptions.

27:53.249 --> 27:55.380
You just--you're in a habit,
it's a habit pattern

27:55.380 --> 27:56.719
that you break and then,

27:56.719 --> 27:57.850
apparently,
you get it right.

27:57.850 --> 27:59.179
both: Yay.

27:59.179 --> 28:00.650
- I'm a quick learner.
- [laughs] Very nice.

28:00.650 --> 28:03.449
- So how did you
get into magic?

28:03.449 --> 28:05.249
- Well,
I had started doing

28:05.249 --> 28:06.979
some volunteer work
around the world.

28:06.979 --> 28:09.479
And then one night
in La Paz, Bolivia,

28:09.479 --> 28:10.949
I saw a bunch
of people gathered

28:10.949 --> 28:12.019
around something happening.

28:12.019 --> 28:13.620
And so it was
a bunch of people

28:13.620 --> 28:14.880
gathered around
a street magician,

28:14.880 --> 28:16.620
and I couldn't really see
what he was doing.

28:16.620 --> 28:18.479
So what I had to do instead
is watch the people

28:18.479 --> 28:20.620
watching him because
I couldn't see him.

28:20.620 --> 28:22.419
And that's what inspired me.

28:22.419 --> 28:24.320
Because they were laughing
and they smiling,

28:24.320 --> 28:25.850
and people who didn't
know each other

28:25.850 --> 28:27.919
were talking to--
"Did you see what that just"--

28:27.919 --> 28:29.749
And I just--it just--
I couldn't shake it.

28:29.749 --> 28:31.919
I got home and I still was
thinking about it,

28:31.919 --> 28:33.519
and it just stayed with me.

28:33.519 --> 28:35.120
And then I...

28:35.120 --> 28:37.650
evolved into being here
with you and them.

28:37.650 --> 28:38.850
And that's why I do mentalism,

28:38.850 --> 28:40.550
is because I get to connect
with people

28:40.550 --> 28:42.519
and have these moments
that are about us

28:42.519 --> 28:44.120
rather than about, necessarily,
just about stuff.

28:44.120 --> 28:47.249
- Yeah. All right, well, let's
check in with Penn and Teller.

28:47.249 --> 28:48.580
Penn, Teller.

28:48.580 --> 28:52.080
- Well, Joshua, I want
to compliment you...

28:52.080 --> 28:56.050
but I can't get to you
before I talk about how good

28:56.050 --> 28:58.519
the guys in the lion
and chicken suit were.

28:58.519 --> 29:01.679
Those were some good
walking animal costumes.

29:01.679 --> 29:03.850
And I felt like the chicken
had a chicken quality

29:03.850 --> 29:05.749
and the lion had
a lion quality.

29:05.749 --> 29:07.719
It was--it was
really, really nice.

29:07.719 --> 29:10.120
I love people

29:10.120 --> 29:11.719
in animal suits.

29:11.719 --> 29:14.320
And I love animals
in people clothes.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.650
Both of those things
amuse me tremendously.

29:16.650 --> 29:18.749
I also like--you know,
mentalism, um,

29:18.749 --> 29:20.179
not our favorite,

29:20.179 --> 29:22.479
and it's usually dry and dull

29:22.479 --> 29:24.179
and pick a number
out of the phone book

29:24.179 --> 29:25.919
and multiply it by 20

29:25.919 --> 29:27.719
and who's thinking of a house.

29:27.719 --> 29:30.919
And all that stuff about
the itsy-bitsy and all of that,

29:30.919 --> 29:32.550
putting all that stuff
in her head,

29:32.550 --> 29:35.380
giving us--giving us
other stuff to think about,

29:35.380 --> 29:37.919
to worry about, you gave us
a lot to worry about.

29:37.919 --> 29:39.850
And you're also
an experienced performer

29:39.850 --> 29:40.919
which is very nice to see.

29:40.919 --> 29:42.550
You know about all
the ins and outs

29:42.550 --> 29:45.150
of show business,
and Teller and I, I'm afraid,

29:45.150 --> 29:48.150
after 43 years, perhaps we know
more about the outs.

29:48.150 --> 29:50.919
But we've been
on both sides of it,

29:50.919 --> 29:52.979
and it's good to see
someone doing a--

29:52.979 --> 29:54.580
doing a great show like that.
- Thank you so much.

29:54.580 --> 29:58.519
- And I want to say
that I was gonna with turkey

29:58.519 --> 30:00.679
and not duck, and I wish--
I don't think

30:00.679 --> 30:02.650
I would have screwed you up
on that.

30:02.650 --> 30:03.850
I think you had me covered.

30:03.850 --> 30:05.580
So, you have an idea
what we're talking about?

30:05.580 --> 30:07.280
- Yes.
- So you didn't fool them?

30:07.280 --> 30:08.679
- That's right.
That's correct.

30:08.679 --> 30:10.219
- Aw, but you certainly
entertained us.

30:10.219 --> 30:11.479
- It was a treat
to be with you

30:11.479 --> 30:12.820
and a treat to be
with you all

30:12.820 --> 30:15.249
and everybody here.
- Thank you, Joshua Lozoff!

30:15.249 --> 30:16.419

he went by onstage,

33:57.670 --> 34:00.330
[cheers and applause]

34:00.330 --> 34:02.269
This is really cool.
So how old is that trick?

34:02.269 --> 34:05.400
- That trick is over
60, 70 years old,

34:05.400 --> 34:07.770
that version,
and that's the version

34:07.770 --> 34:09.929
he came up with
many years ago.

34:09.929 --> 34:11.799
There was an older version
before that,

34:11.799 --> 34:13.529
the lampshade and a lamp.

34:13.529 --> 34:15.069
And he wanted to make it

34:15.069 --> 34:16.469
where it was just a bulb
and a cord.

34:16.469 --> 34:18.730
- So you're sort of
a historian as well, I take it.

34:18.730 --> 34:21.569
- I love old magic.
I love the history of magic.

34:21.569 --> 34:24.069
I'm a fan of all the greats
that we grew up to

34:24.069 --> 34:26.629
from Valentine, to Thurston,
to Houdini.

34:26.629 --> 34:28.270
I'm a huge fan,
because without them,

34:28.270 --> 34:30.929
we wouldn't be here today
in magic in my opinion, so...

34:30.929 --> 34:33.770
- Yeah.
That's so cool that you--

34:33.770 --> 34:35.600
you're keeping
the traditional magic alive.

34:35.600 --> 34:37.668
- I try to, you know.
I think that's how you learn.

34:37.668 --> 34:38.899
You learn from the past,

34:38.899 --> 34:40.629
and that's how you
reinvent things

34:40.629 --> 34:42.168
or better things
or at least learn from

34:42.168 --> 34:43.429
the legends from behind.

34:43.429 --> 34:45.100
- All right, well, let's
check in with the boys.

34:45.100 --> 34:47.199
- Sure.
- Penn, Teller.

34:47.199 --> 34:48.629
- You know, we know--

34:48.629 --> 34:52.469
we know an awful lot
about the act,

34:52.469 --> 34:55.100
So we would have used
that as a code

34:55.100 --> 34:56.799
to sneak in Roy and--

34:56.799 --> 34:58.299
we know a lot about that.

34:58.299 --> 35:00.569
Great to see that act.
It's just really great to see--

35:00.569 --> 35:01.770
- It's an amazing piece,
isn't it?

35:01.770 --> 35:03.000
- And that's--those are
the actual props?

35:03.000 --> 35:04.469
- Those are the actual props.
[Penn sighs]

35:04.469 --> 35:07.430
And I have old footage
of him teaching me

35:07.430 --> 35:09.299
in Palm Springs.

35:09.299 --> 35:10.669
'Cause I wanted him
to actually touch them

35:10.669 --> 35:12.100
and wanted to see him
actually just do it

35:12.100 --> 35:13.230
and it was great.

35:13.230 --> 35:14.669
You know, he's 92,
but it was just great

35:14.669 --> 35:15.899
'cause he did everything

35:15.899 --> 35:16.969
just the way
you would normally--

35:16.969 --> 35:18.569
he'd do it when he toured,
you know.

35:18.569 --> 35:19.899
- Also, you know,
and you forget

35:19.899 --> 35:21.799
how many provers there are
on the milk picture.

35:21.799 --> 35:23.200
- Oh, my goodness.

35:23.200 --> 35:24.270
- I mean, there's
all those provers

35:24.270 --> 35:25.899
that really do sell it
completely

35:25.899 --> 35:27.629
and that you did beautifully.
- Yes.

35:27.629 --> 35:29.270
- It's beautiful.
- Oh, well, thank you.

35:29.270 --> 35:31.200
- And it's just gorgeous props,

35:31.200 --> 35:33.669
but, you know,
we know the illusion.

35:33.669 --> 35:35.069
- Of course you do.

35:35.069 --> 35:36.500
- We're so glad you came out
and did it, Murray.

35:36.500 --> 35:38.069
- Thank you for having me on.
I really appreciate it guys.

35:38.069 --> 35:40.069
Thank you so much.
Congratulations to you.

35:40.069 --> 35:41.799

It's the same card

38:48.179 --> 38:49.449
So how does it work?

38:49.449 --> 38:52.219
You use a card force,
a really great one.

38:52.219 --> 38:53.679
Before your friend comes over,

38:53.679 --> 38:55.849
take the three of clubs

38:55.849 --> 39:00.650
and place it just
underneath the envelope.

39:00.650 --> 39:02.820
Have your friend
examine the cards.

39:02.820 --> 39:04.980
Have your friend
shuffle the cards.

39:04.980 --> 39:07.250
When you ask them,
"What time is it?"

39:07.250 --> 39:09.679
that's called misdirection.

39:09.679 --> 39:11.320
It gives them something
to think about

39:11.320 --> 39:14.219
while you pick up the envelope
with the card

39:14.219 --> 39:16.119
and lay it right on top.

39:16.119 --> 39:19.019
They think it's the card
they shuffled to,

39:19.019 --> 39:21.920
but it's really the top card,
the three of clubs

39:21.920 --> 39:23.619
that I put down
with the envelope.

39:23.619 --> 39:25.480
Have 'em take that card,

39:25.480 --> 39:28.480
put it in the envelope,

39:28.480 --> 39:31.179
write down their name on it,

39:31.179 --> 39:33.449
and then seal it up.

39:33.449 --> 39:38.019
Then all you've got to do
is go to the internet

39:38.019 --> 39:41.920
and type in
"Penn & Teller grave."

39:41.920 --> 39:44.449
All those photos,
you know where those are from?

39:44.449 --> 39:46.650

a lot of fake pictures.

39:46.650 --> 39:48.119
Nope.

41:08.019 --> 41:09.619
then teach it to them,

41:09.619 --> 41:11.349
they can pass it along
to their children

41:11.349 --> 41:12.820
as a family tradition.

41:12.820 --> 41:16.920
And as long as that continues,
Teller and I will live on.

41:16.920 --> 41:18.349
If only in this trick.

41:18.349 --> 41:20.079
Buried like a time capsule,
