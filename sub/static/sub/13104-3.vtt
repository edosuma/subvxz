00:51.510 --> 00:53.978
SHE HAS BEEN IN NIGHT SCHOOL

00:54.020 --> 00:55.442
SHE'S LITERALLY TAKEN
EVERY CLASS

00:55.480 --> 00:56.617

radio chatter)

01:57.410 --> 01:58.900

SO IF THEY HUMILIATE
THE LOCAL BOYS,

WE COULD BE BUSY.

02:36.350 --> 02:39.046

15:12.010 --> 15:14.137
OFFICER DIAZ STAYED
IN THE CAR.

15:14.180 --> 15:16.068
UH, AS I APPROACHED
THE STORE,

15:16.110 --> 15:19.375
THE OWNER WAS OUTSIDE
WATERING PLANTS.

15:19.410 --> 15:21.844
I WENT IN,
AND THE YOUNG MAN...

15:23.120 --> 15:24.439
DO YOU KNOW HIS NAME?

15:24.490 --> 15:25.741
TYLER MARKES.

15:27.120 --> 15:29.918
MR. MARKES
WAS BEHIND THE COUNTER.

15:29.960 --> 15:31.882
I KNEW RIGHT AWAY
SOMETHING WAS OFF.

15:31.930 --> 15:34.956
WAIT A MINUTE. HOW DID YOU
KNOW SOMETHING WAS OFF?

15:35.000 --> 15:37.321
UH, IT WAS--I JUST--
IT WAS A FEELING.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.258
HE, UH,
HE WAS BEHIND THE COUNTER.

15:39.300 --> 15:42.235
HE WAS, UM, WEARING
A HOODIE.

15:42.270 --> 15:43.931
OKAY.
JUST A FEELING,

15:43.970 --> 15:46.700
SO I ASKED HIM TO STEP OUT
FROM BEHIND THE COUNTER,

15:46.740 --> 15:50.608
AND, UM, HE--HE DIDN'T.

15:50.650 --> 15:53.039
HE, UH...

15:53.080 --> 15:55.116
SORRY. JUST...

15:55.150 --> 15:57.448
I CAN'T--ONE SECOND.

16:02.890 --> 16:05.757
HE DIDN'T. HE DUCKED DOWN
WHERE I COULDN'T SEE HIM.

16:05.790 --> 16:07.929
I CALLED FOR BACKUP.

16:07.960 --> 16:09.894
THE OWNER CAME IN
FROM OUTSIDE.

16:09.930 --> 16:11.591
THAT'S WHEN I SAW IT.

16:11.630 --> 16:15.566
HE STOOD UP, AND HE WAS
POINTING A GUN AT ME.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.909
WHAT KIND OF GUN WAS IT?

16:19.140 --> 16:20.437
I DON'T KNOW.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.629
CALIBER?

16:21.680 --> 16:22.931
I-I DON'T KNOW.

16:22.980 --> 16:24.948
WHAT ABOUT THE COLOR?

16:24.980 --> 16:27.210
BLACK? SILVER?

16:27.250 --> 16:29.411
IT WAS, UM...

16:29.450 --> 16:31.418
IT WAS NOT SILVER.
IT WAS BLACK.

16:31.450 --> 16:34.419
OKAY, SO YOU DREW
YOUR WEAPON?

16:34.460 --> 16:37.020
YES. NO. UH, IT WAS--

16:37.060 --> 16:39.187
I HAD ALREADY DRAWN IT.
IT WAS, UH...

16:39.230 --> 16:40.629
WEAPON WAS ALREADY OUT.

16:40.660 --> 16:43.959
AND WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

16:44.000 --> 16:45.422
HE STOOD UP.

16:45.470 --> 16:47.199
HE WAS POINTING HIS GUN
AT ME,

16:47.240 --> 16:48.935
AND I SHOT HIM.

16:48.970 --> 16:50.369
HOW MANY TIMES?

16:50.410 --> 16:52.264
TWICE.

16:52.310 --> 16:53.709
WHY DID YOU STAY IN THE CAR?

16:53.740 --> 16:55.537
WHY DIDN'T YOU GO INSIDE
WITH YOUR PARTNER?

16:55.580 --> 16:58.606
UM... UH, NO REASON.

16:58.650 --> 17:00.413
UH, DOV JUST WANTED
LICORICE.

17:00.450 --> 17:02.145
I WAS JUST GONNA
WAIT OUTSIDE.

17:02.180 --> 17:03.886
IN YOUR OPINION,
DOES OFFICER EPSTEIN HAVE

17:03.920 --> 17:05.182
A SHORT TEMPER?

17:05.220 --> 17:06.642
UH...

17:06.690 --> 17:08.089
DOES HE TEND TO LOSE
HIS COOL?

17:08.120 --> 17:10.088
NO. NOT AT ALL.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.928
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD HIM MAKE
ANY RACIST STATEMENTS?

17:12.960 --> 17:14.791
WHAT?

17:14.830 --> 17:15.990
UH...

17:16.030 --> 17:18.021
THESE ARE STANDARD QUESTIONS,
OFFICER DIAZ.

17:18.070 --> 17:22.291
Y--NO. NO, UH, NEVER.

17:22.340 --> 17:24.160
OFFICER EPSTEIN,
DID YOU KNOW THE VICTIM?

17:24.210 --> 17:26.132
SORRY?

17:26.170 --> 17:28.434
HAVE YOU EVER HAD
PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE

17:28.480 --> 17:29.435
WITH THE VICTIM?

17:29.480 --> 17:31.778
NO.

17:31.810 --> 17:33.448
A WARNING?
WITNESS STATEMENTS?

17:33.480 --> 17:34.447
NO.

17:34.480 --> 17:35.845
PREVIOUS CALLS
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD?

17:35.880 --> 17:39.247
YES, BUT THAT...

17:39.290 --> 17:40.587
OF COURSE.

17:40.620 --> 17:42.417
WERE YOU LOOKING
FOR TYLER MARKES TODAY?

17:44.790 --> 17:45.927
I'M SORRY?

17:45.960 --> 17:48.155
DID YOU INTEND
TO SHOOT HIM?

17:50.970 --> 17:53.530
I-I CHANGED MY MIND.

17:53.570 --> 17:56.459
I'D LIKE A LAWYER, PLEASE.

17:56.500 --> 17:58.058
OKAY.

18:02.610 --> 18:04.601
IT HAPPENED SO FAST.
I SAW THE COP DRAW A GUN.

18:04.650 --> 18:05.878
I PUT MY HANDS UP LIKE THIS,

18:05.910 --> 18:07.116
AND THE OTHER COP
PULLED ME BACK.

18:07.150 --> 18:08.412
DID YOU SEE THE KID?

18:08.450 --> 18:10.247
UH, N-NO, NOT REALLY.

18:10.290 --> 18:13.088
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
DID YOU SEE HIM OR NOT?

18:13.120 --> 18:15.259
UH... JUST A SECOND.

18:15.290 --> 18:16.484
DID HE HAVE A GUN?

18:16.520 --> 18:18.579
I-I DON'T KNOW.
I DIDN'T SEE.

18:18.630 --> 18:19.927
IS HE A MEMBER OF A GANG?

18:19.960 --> 18:22.099
(chuckles) NO, NO.

18:22.130 --> 18:23.097
(chuckles)
I STAY OUT OF THAT STUFF.

18:23.130 --> 18:25.269
THAT'S NONE
OF MY BUSINESS.

18:25.300 --> 18:26.927
YOU GETTING ANYTHING
FROM THIS GUY?

18:26.970 --> 18:28.437
NO. NOT YET.

18:28.470 --> 18:30.062
HAS HE GOT A SHEET?
YEAH, HE'S GOT TWO PRIORS.

18:30.100 --> 18:31.067
(Sam and Trevor speaking
indistinctly)
I MEAN, DRUG STUFF.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.338
HE'S ON PAROLE.
(sighs)

18:32.370 --> 18:36.136
ALL RIGHT. S.I.U. TURNED
THE STORE UPSIDE DOWN. SO DID I.

18:36.180 --> 18:37.408
THERE'S NO GUN,

18:37.450 --> 18:39.406
SO UNLESS THIS GUY
STARTS TALKING,

18:39.450 --> 18:41.441
THE ONLY THING THAT PUTS
A GUN IN THE KID'S HAND...

18:41.480 --> 18:43.072
(Trevor) THAT--THAT IS
NONE OF MY BUSINESS.
IS EPSTEIN'S STATEMENT,

18:43.120 --> 18:44.678
ALL RIGHT?
MM-HMM.

18:44.720 --> 18:45.982
IT IS YOUR BUSINESS.
YOU HAVE TO PROTECT YOURSELF.
GOTTA GO.

18:46.020 --> 18:47.578
IT WOULD TAKE YOU ALL
OF TWO SECONDS TO FIND OUT

18:47.620 --> 18:48.814
IF THAT KID WAS IN A GANG.

18:48.860 --> 18:50.384
NO. (sighs) HOW MUCH LONGER
AM I GONNA BE HERE?

18:50.430 --> 18:53.024
THAT'S COMPLETELY UP TO YOU,
MR. SANTOS.

18:53.060 --> 18:54.857
LOOK, WE CAN KEEP
DOING THIS.

18:54.900 --> 18:56.424
YOU CAN KEEP TELLING US THAT
YOU DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING,

18:56.460 --> 18:58.428
BUT I GOTTA SAY,
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO,

18:58.470 --> 19:00.165
I'M GONNA BECOME
YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND.

19:00.200 --> 19:01.565
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

19:01.600 --> 19:03.465
I'M GONNA COME
TO YOUR STORE EVERY DAY,

19:03.510 --> 19:08.777
JUST TO SAY HI, YOU KNOW,
CHAT, LAUGH.

19:08.810 --> 19:10.107
I'M GONNA MAKE SURE

19:10.140 --> 19:12.279
THAT EVERY SINGLE PERSON
IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD KNOWS

19:12.310 --> 19:15.017
JUST HOW TIGHT YOU ARE
WITH THE COPS.

19:15.050 --> 19:16.972
(chuckles)
THIS IS HARASSMENT.

19:17.020 --> 19:18.339
SIT DOWN.

19:23.160 --> 19:26.425
MR. SANTOS,
I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED.

19:26.460 --> 19:28.257
JUST TELL US THE TRUTH.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.427
YOU SAW TYLER MARKES HAD A GUN.

19:30.470 --> 19:33.394
YOU SAW HE WAS ABOUT TO SHOOT
OFFICER EPSTEIN.

19:34.970 --> 19:38.428
NO. HE WASN'T.

19:38.470 --> 19:40.438
THE KID WASN'T ARMED.
HE WAS CLEAN.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.937
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I SAW?

19:42.980 --> 19:46.643
I SAW A COP SHOOT A KID
IN COLD BLOOD.

19:48.820 --> 19:51.243
SO WHO'S GOT A PROBLEM
WITH THE NEIGHBORHOOD NOW?

19:53.320 --> 19:55.880
I WATCHED THAT KID GROW UP.

19:55.920 --> 19:59.083
TYLER--I KNEW HIM
HIS WHOLE LIFE.

19:59.130 --> 20:01.724
MY CONDOLENCES, JONES.

20:01.760 --> 20:04.263
***

20:04.300 --> 20:06.723
ARE YOU SURE THERE'S NOTHING
YOU WANNA TELL ME, FRANK?

20:06.770 --> 20:07.930
YOU KNOW,
THIS INFORMATION THING,

20:07.970 --> 20:09.437
I'M THINKING, SHOULD BE
A 2-WAY STREET--

20:09.470 --> 20:11.609
GIVE AND TAKE.

20:11.640 --> 20:12.937
MEANING WHAT?

20:12.970 --> 20:15.006
MEANING THAT MAYBE IT WAS
A COP THAT SHOT THAT BOY.

20:15.040 --> 20:17.076
WAS YOUR BOY GANGED UP?

20:17.110 --> 20:18.941
NOW THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

20:18.980 --> 20:20.948
IF IT IS A COP
AND THEY FIND OUT,

20:20.980 --> 20:22.413
THERE'S GONNA BE
TROUBLE, FRANK.

20:22.450 --> 20:25.089
YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT.
TROUBLE.

20:25.120 --> 20:28.214
(crowd cheering
and shouting indistinctly)

20:28.260 --> 20:30.581
WE'RE NOT FEELING
THE LOVE HERE, SIR.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.257
CAN I MAKE A SUGGESTION?

20:32.290 --> 20:34.099
WE COULD SHUT THIS WHOLE THING
DOWN RIGHT NOW, SIR.

20:34.130 --> 20:35.256
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE.

20:35.300 --> 20:36.927
ANY OF THESE GUYS HAVE
AUTOMATIC WEAPONS--

20:36.960 --> 20:38.666
HEY. THEY BELONG TO A GANG.

20:38.700 --> 20:40.565
THAT DOESN'T MAKE 'EM
BARBARIC OR STUPID.

20:41.870 --> 20:43.838
STAY ON CHANNEL 3.

20:50.010 --> 20:51.272
(indistinct conversations)

20:51.310 --> 20:54.313
(telephone ringing in distance,
radio chatter)

20:59.790 --> 21:02.213
(buzzer)

21:07.460 --> 21:09.792
HEY. H-HOW'D IT GO?

21:09.830 --> 21:11.388
FINE. YOU?

21:11.430 --> 21:12.397
(exhales deeply)
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

21:12.430 --> 21:14.091
THE, UH, THE QUESTIONS--

21:14.140 --> 21:16.358
THEY WERE...
THEY WERE PRETTY CRAZY.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.504
IT'S OKAY. THEY'RE JUST
DOING THEIR JOB.

21:20.710 --> 21:22.769
HAVE WE, UH, HEARD ANYTHING
FROM THE HOSPITAL YET?

21:22.810 --> 21:24.277
YEAH, UH...

21:24.310 --> 21:26.778
HE DIDN'T MAKE IT.

21:26.810 --> 21:28.516
HE DIED IN SURGERY.

21:29.550 --> 21:31.279
I'M SORRY, DOV.

21:35.620 --> 21:37.622
HEY, DOV.

21:38.790 --> 21:41.588
IT GETS WORSE.

21:41.630 --> 21:43.996
THEY CAN'T FIND THE GUN.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.059
WE'RE GONNA KEEP LOOKIN'...

21:53.070 --> 21:54.628
BUT WE NEED TO TALK
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS

21:54.680 --> 21:57.478
IF WE DON'T RECOVER
THAT GUN AT THE SCENE.

21:59.680 --> 22:01.944
SO... (clears throat)

22:01.980 --> 22:06.417
THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO
IS THAT THEY FIND THAT

22:06.450 --> 22:10.113
YOUR LIFE WAS NOT IN DANGER
AND YOU USED EXCESSIVE FORCE.

22:10.160 --> 22:11.582
(sighs)
THAT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD.

22:11.630 --> 22:14.451
HEY, DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.
WE'RE NOT THERE YET,

22:14.500 --> 22:16.718
BUT WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED
FOR THE WORST.

22:20.970 --> 22:22.892
SO, EPSTEIN, THE KID...

22:24.640 --> 22:26.039
HE HAD A GUN?

22:26.070 --> 22:28.436
YES.

22:28.480 --> 22:30.129
YOU'RE SURE?

22:38.620 --> 22:40.349
WHAT HAPPENS IF HE DIDN'T?

22:40.390 --> 22:41.755
(inhales deeply)

22:41.790 --> 22:42.779
(clears throat and sighs)

22:42.820 --> 22:49.555
***

22:54.070 --> 22:55.765
(indistinct conversations,
radio chatter)

22:55.800 --> 22:58.803
(telephone ringing in distance)

23:01.380 --> 23:02.802
JERRY'S LOOKING FOR YOU.

23:02.840 --> 23:05.673
YEAH, I KNOW.
HE'S CALLED ME 15 TIMES.

23:05.710 --> 23:06.699
LOOK, UM...

23:06.750 --> 23:08.377
I DON'T KNOW. I-I DON'T.

23:08.420 --> 23:09.739
I CAN'T REMEMBER
WHAT I SAW ANYMORE.

23:09.780 --> 23:11.338
I MEAN, I-I'M TRYING,
BUT I--

23:11.390 --> 23:12.448
DOV, YOU SAW A GUN.

23:12.490 --> 23:14.082
YEAH, BUT WHAT IF HE DIDN'T
HAVE ONE?

23:14.120 --> 23:17.055
HOW DO I LIVE WITH THAT?
WHAT DO I DO WITH THAT?

23:17.090 --> 23:19.422
I THINK YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU SAW.

23:19.460 --> 23:22.327
YOU KNOW,
WE ALL BELIEVE YOU,

23:22.360 --> 23:24.828
BUT, YOU KNOW,
IF IT TURNS OUT THAT

23:24.870 --> 23:28.465
IT WASN'T QUITE LIKE THAT,

23:28.500 --> 23:32.209
THEN, UH...
WE'LL WORK FROM THAT.

23:37.550 --> 23:40.519
(indistinct conversations)

23:40.550 --> 23:41.517
(door closes)

23:41.550 --> 23:43.484
(buzzer in distance)

23:43.520 --> 23:45.181
HEY.

23:45.720 --> 23:47.039
HEY. WHERE IS HE?

23:47.090 --> 23:48.580
HE'S, UH, HE'S IN THE GYM.

23:48.620 --> 23:50.110
HE'S STARTING TO DOUBT
HIS OWN MEMORY.

23:50.160 --> 23:51.718
(lowered voice)
THIS WHOLE THING COULD TURN.

23:51.760 --> 23:52.829
I WANT
TO TALK TO THE WITNESS.

23:52.860 --> 23:53.827
YOU CAN'T.

23:53.860 --> 23:54.827
YOU CAN'T GO NEAR HIM.

23:54.860 --> 23:56.259
UH, HE WAS RIGHT THERE.

23:56.300 --> 23:58.268
I MEAN, I PULLED HIM
OUT OF THE STORE.

23:58.300 --> 24:01.337
HE MUST HAVE SEEN EVERYTHING.
WHY WOULD HE LIE ABOUT THAT?

24:01.370 --> 24:03.338
(telephone ringing in distance)

24:03.370 --> 24:05.008
WHAT?

24:05.040 --> 24:07.008
(chair wheels rattle)

24:07.040 --> 24:10.840
JERRY. (lowered voice)
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH DOV?

24:10.880 --> 24:13.519
WELL, ASSUMING I CAN
FIND HIM,

24:13.550 --> 24:14.517
I'M GONNA WALK HIM
THROUGH IT

24:14.550 --> 24:16.609
AND TRY AND DETERMINE
SOME FACTS.

24:16.650 --> 24:18.686
DO YOU BELIEVE HIS STORY?

24:18.720 --> 24:20.039
DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT I BELIEVE.

24:20.090 --> 24:23.651
JERRY, HE SAW A GUN.

24:23.690 --> 24:26.818
YOU WANT TO BE A DETECTIVE,
START THINKING LIKE ONE,

24:26.860 --> 24:28.396
WHICH MEANS YOU DON'T FORM
A CONCLUSION

24:28.430 --> 24:29.658
AND FIND EVIDENCE
TO SUPPORT IT.

24:29.700 --> 24:32.294
YOU ESTABLISH FACTS,
AND THEN YOU FOLLOW THEM.

24:32.330 --> 24:33.638
YOU SEE WHERE THEY TAKE YOU.

24:33.670 --> 24:34.830
OKAY, BUT THIS IS DOV--

24:34.870 --> 24:37.634
NO, NO, NO.
QUESTION EVERYTHING.

24:37.670 --> 24:39.604
DOUBT EVERYTHING.

24:39.640 --> 24:42.200
HE HAD A SECOND TO FORM
A JUDGMENT, MAYBE LESS.

24:42.240 --> 24:43.639
IT COULD HAVE BEEN A GUN
IN THE KID'S HAND,

24:43.680 --> 24:45.102
BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN
A PHONE.

24:45.150 --> 24:47.675
IT COULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING.

24:47.720 --> 24:51.383
LOOK, I WANT TO BELIEVE HIM,

24:51.420 --> 24:53.479
BUT I GOT A JOB TO DO.

24:53.520 --> 24:55.078
SO DO YOU.

24:56.620 --> 24:58.554
SO I'VE BEEN GOING
THROUGH YOUR FILE.

24:58.590 --> 25:00.126
YOU'VE GOT TWO CONVICTIONS--
POSSESSION,

25:00.160 --> 25:01.957
POSSESSION
FOR THE PURPOSE OF.

25:02.000 --> 25:05.026
WENT TO JAIL FOR TWO YEARS.
I MEAN, VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD,

25:05.070 --> 25:08.198
BUT THEN I NOTICED THIS.

25:08.240 --> 25:11.129
I MEAN,
THESE ARE INCIDENT REPORTS.

25:11.170 --> 25:13.809
YOUR STORE HAS BEEN ROBBED
17 TIMES IN THE LAST 2 YEARS.

25:13.840 --> 25:15.171
SO?

25:15.210 --> 25:16.871
WELL, DID YOU HAVE A GUN
IN THE STORE, MR. SANTOS?

25:16.910 --> 25:18.241
MAYBE BEHIND THE COUNTER?

25:18.280 --> 25:19.872
(chuckles) NO. NO WAY.

25:19.910 --> 25:20.877
ARE YOU SURE?

25:20.920 --> 25:22.114
YEAH, I'M SURE.

25:22.150 --> 25:23.549
YEAH. NO, I'D PROBABLY SAY
THE SAME THING, TOO,

25:23.590 --> 25:24.579
IF I WERE YOU,

25:24.620 --> 25:27.180
I MEAN, GIVEN
THAT YOU'RE ON PAROLE,

25:27.220 --> 25:29.108
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
IF YOU HAD A GUN,

25:29.160 --> 25:31.924
YOU WOULD BE GOING
STRAIGHT BACK TO PRISON.

25:31.960 --> 25:33.450
THAT'S WHAT TYLER WAS AFTER.

25:33.490 --> 25:35.958
HE KNEW THERE WAS A GUN,
WENT IN TO STEAL IT,

25:36.000 --> 25:37.797
MAYBE EVEN USE IT TO ROB
THE PLACE,

25:37.830 --> 25:40.469
BUT HE DIDN'T GET THAT FAR,
AND THIS GUY IS LYING.

25:40.500 --> 25:42.968
BECAUSE HE'S ON PAROLE.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.036
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS
THERE'S NO GUN.

25:45.070 --> 25:46.765
SO LET'S GO BACK,
HAVE ANOTHER LOOK.

25:46.810 --> 25:50.200
YEAH, IT'S NOT THERE, SAM.
WE'RE NOT GONNA FIND IT.

25:50.240 --> 25:51.207
(Trevor, filtered voice)
HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE

25:51.250 --> 25:52.205
TO SAY THIS?

25:52.250 --> 25:54.309
THERE WAS NO GUN.

25:54.350 --> 25:56.375
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M PSYCHING MYSELF OUT.

25:56.420 --> 25:58.388
I KEEP THINKING
SOMEBODY'S GONNA COME

25:58.420 --> 26:00.786
OUT OF NOWHERE AND JUST,
LIKE, TAKE IT FROM ME.

26:00.820 --> 26:02.549
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

26:02.590 --> 26:05.957
WELL, I HOPE NOT. (sighs)

26:05.990 --> 26:06.957
(sighs)

26:06.990 --> 26:09.129
BUT ONE OF THE COURSES
THAT I TOOK,

26:09.160 --> 26:12.129
PRINCIPLES OF INTERROGATION,

26:12.170 --> 26:14.934
I LEARNED THIS TECHNIQUE THAT'S
SUPPOSED TO HELP WITNESSES

26:14.970 --> 26:17.438
SEE THINGS
A LITTLE BIT MORE CLEARLY.

26:17.470 --> 26:20.200
WHAT, YOU WANT
TO TRY IT OUT ON ME?

26:20.240 --> 26:21.639
I DO.

26:22.710 --> 26:24.439
YEAH, OKAY.
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

26:24.480 --> 26:26.277
OKAY. SIT DOWN.
WHAT DO--

26:26.310 --> 26:27.811
OKAY.

26:29.320 --> 26:33.086
JUST, LIKE, GET COMFORTABLE.
MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE...

26:33.120 --> 26:36.510
(sighs)
AND CLOSE YOUR EYES.

26:36.560 --> 26:38.687
CLOSE YOUR EYES.

26:38.730 --> 26:40.322
(sighs)

26:44.300 --> 26:46.120
OKAY.

26:46.170 --> 26:48.730
NOW PUT YOURSELF BACK
AT THE SCENE.

26:50.100 --> 26:52.864
OKAY. YOU'VE JUST ARRIVED
AT THE STORE.

26:52.910 --> 26:54.798
NOW TELL ME...

26:54.840 --> 26:57.377
NOT WHAT YOU SEE,

26:57.410 --> 27:00.607
BUT TELL ME WHAT YOU FEEL,
WHAT YOU HEAR.

27:00.650 --> 27:02.777
WHAT DO YOU SMELL?

27:02.820 --> 27:04.788
UH, I SMELL DETERGENT.

27:05.990 --> 27:09.380
THERE'S FISH
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OFF

27:09.420 --> 27:11.320
IN THE FREEZER.

27:11.360 --> 27:13.248
OKAY. THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S GOOD. WHAT DO YOU HEAR?

27:13.290 --> 27:14.689
I HEAR TRAFFIC.

27:14.730 --> 27:16.948
(engine rumbles)
A MOTORCYCLE.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.468
I HEAR, UH, SOMETHING
ON THE RADIO.

27:19.500 --> 27:22.060
I CAN'T MAKE OUT
EXACTLY WHAT,

27:22.100 --> 27:23.636
UH, AND THEN THE OWNER
IS YELLING.

27:23.670 --> 27:24.762
I TELL HIM TO SHUT UP.

27:24.810 --> 27:28.302
DISPATCH IS IN MY WALKIE,
AND...

27:29.310 --> 27:30.436
THAT'S IT.

27:30.480 --> 27:32.107
OKAY. FEEL.
WHAT DO YOU FEEL?

27:33.980 --> 27:36.119
MY HAND...

27:36.150 --> 27:37.742
IS ON MY GUN,

27:37.790 --> 27:40.987
ON THE GRIP.
I PULL IT FROM MY HOLSTER.

27:43.490 --> 27:46.084
I'M SCARED
FOR A SECOND, FROZEN.

27:46.130 --> 27:49.395
THEN I JUMP BACK,
AND I HIT... A SHELF.

27:49.430 --> 27:51.159
S-SOMETHING FALLS
FROM THE SHELF,

27:51.200 --> 27:52.861
HITS THE FLOOR.

27:55.540 --> 27:57.735
MY FINGER...

27:57.770 --> 27:59.032
TOUCHES THE TRIGGER.

27:59.070 --> 28:00.435
I SQUEEZE.

28:00.470 --> 28:02.938
THE GUN BUCKS HARD,
LIKE A PUNCH.

28:02.980 --> 28:04.641
BAM!
(gunshot)

28:08.150 --> 28:11.039
SECOND SHOT'S SOFTER,
LIKE, UH...

28:11.090 --> 28:12.045
MORE LIKE A POP.

28:12.090 --> 28:15.287
(gunshot)

28:15.320 --> 28:17.652
WHY DID THEY SOUND
DIFFERENT?

28:18.990 --> 28:21.129
I DON'T KNOW.
MY EARS WERE RINGING AND...

28:21.160 --> 28:22.798
HOW MANY TIMES DID YOU FIRE?

28:22.830 --> 28:26.527
TWICE. I TOLD YOU.
BANG! POP.

28:26.570 --> 28:29.459
WELL, IS IT POSSIBLE
THAT HE FIRED, TOO?

28:31.170 --> 28:33.934
(Ski Beatz's "This World"
Playing)

28:33.980 --> 28:36.778
(sighs) DOV MUST BE FREAKING
OUT RIGHT NOW.

28:36.810 --> 28:37.947
* THEY SAY FOOLISH PRIDE *

28:37.980 --> 28:40.778
(sighs) I WASN'T EXPECTING
THIS COMING BACK.

28:40.820 --> 28:43.118
THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
A BIT MORE...

28:43.150 --> 28:45.118
PEACEFUL?

28:45.150 --> 28:47.038
GUYS, HEY.

28:47.090 --> 28:48.682
WOULD YOU MIND LIFTING UP
YOUR SHIRTS FOR ME, PLEASE?

28:48.720 --> 28:49.687
(chuckles)
YEAH, THIS ISN'T KANDAHAR.

28:49.720 --> 28:51.051
COME ON.
COME ON. INDULGE ME.

28:51.090 --> 28:52.682
JUST LIFI' 'EM UP AND SWIVEL.

UH, 1521.

28:56.530 --> 28:58.691
WE'RE NEAR ST. JAMES
AND BLEECKER.

28:58.730 --> 29:00.459
SOMEONE JUST THREW
A SHOPPING CART AT US.

29:00.500 --> 29:01.967

(man) TURN AROUND
AND DON'T COME BACK!

29:09.640 --> 29:11.107
PEOPLE ARE LEAVING.
THEY'RE SCARED.

29:11.150 --> 29:13.448
YEAH. I WANT YOU OUT OF HERE.
I WANT YOU BACK AT THE PRECINCT.

29:13.480 --> 29:14.549
FRANK, KNOCK IT OFF.

29:14.580 --> 29:15.774
HEY, I OUTRANK YOU.

29:15.820 --> 29:17.117
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT,
FILE A GRIEVANCE.

29:17.150 --> 29:19.448
WAIT RIGHT HERE
FOR A SECOND. ROLAND.

29:19.490 --> 29:20.741
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

29:20.790 --> 29:23.179
LISTEN, PEOPLE ARE LEAVING,

29:23.220 --> 29:24.448
AND MY MEN ARE UNDER ATTACK.
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

29:24.490 --> 29:25.457
I HAVE NOTHING TO SAY
TO YOU.

29:25.490 --> 29:28.129
HEY, LISTEN.

29:28.160 --> 29:29.457
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU, FRANK?

29:29.500 --> 29:30.626
IT DOESN'T MATTER
TO YOU NO MORE,

29:30.660 --> 29:32.366
AS LONG AS WE'RE SHOOTING
EACH OTHER.

29:32.400 --> 29:33.628
IS THAT HOW IT IS?

29:33.670 --> 29:35.638
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT?

29:35.670 --> 29:38.309
YOU KNEW ALL ALONG
IT WASN'T A GANG SHOOTING.

29:38.340 --> 29:41.434
YOU KNEW IT...
(whispers) ALL ALONG.

29:41.480 --> 29:42.936
(normal voice)
YOU KNOW WHAT?

29:42.980 --> 29:44.902
IT'S A COP THAT SHOT TYLER.

29:44.950 --> 29:46.474
IT WAS A COP
THAT SHOT TYLER!

29:46.510 --> 29:47.579
AND ONE OF YOURS.
WHERE DID YOU HEAR THAT FROM?

29:47.610 --> 29:48.611
IT DON'T MATTER
WHERE I HEARD IT FROM.

29:48.650 --> 29:49.776
TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF ME.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

29:49.820 --> 29:52.243
IF YOU WANT, YOU ARREST ME.
ARREST ME!

29:52.290 --> 29:53.609

ALL RIGHT.

WE'RE DONE HERE.

29:57.160 --> 29:58.787
* ENEMIES WHERE YOU LIVE AT *

29:58.830 --> 30:00.457

WHAT WAS THAT?

30:06.330 --> 30:08.139
(crowd cheering)

30:08.170 --> 30:11.435
THINGS JUST WENT FROM BAD
TO WORSE.

30:14.610 --> 30:16.032
SO DOV WAS ABOUT... HERE?

30:16.080 --> 30:17.968
NO, UH, TAKE A STEP BACK.

30:18.010 --> 30:19.079
(radio chatter)

30:19.110 --> 30:21.010
I'M TYLER.
I'M BEHIND THE COUNTER.

30:21.050 --> 30:23.439
DUCK DOWN.

30:23.480 --> 30:25.243
I COME BACK UP. BOOM!

30:29.820 --> 30:32.721
OKAY, GUYS. I GET IT. ALL RIGHT.
YOU TRUST YOUR FRIEND.

30:32.760 --> 30:33.897
YOU WANT TO BELIEVE HIM.

30:33.930 --> 30:35.397
DOV'S BEEN OVER
THESE TWO OR THREE SECONDS

30:35.430 --> 30:36.897
A THOUSAND TIMES,

30:36.930 --> 30:38.227
AND EACH TIME,
IT GETS LESS CLEAR.

30:38.270 --> 30:39.567
I GOT SOMETHING.

30:39.600 --> 30:40.669
SERIOUSLY?

30:40.700 --> 30:41.667
YEAH. RIGHT HERE.

30:41.700 --> 30:42.837
LET'S SEE.

30:42.870 --> 30:44.838
(clicks)

30:44.870 --> 30:47.566
OH. YEAH, YOU DO.

30:47.610 --> 30:49.373
(plastic rustling)

30:49.410 --> 30:50.377
GOT IT?

30:50.410 --> 30:51.843
YEP.

30:55.520 --> 30:58.546
OKAY, WE GOT A BULLET.
WHERE'S THE GUN?

30:58.590 --> 30:59.784
IT'S GOTTA BE HERE.

30:59.820 --> 31:01.549
WELL, IT ISN'T,
BECAUSE WE'VE LOOKED.

31:01.590 --> 31:03.785
NOW THIS PLACE HAS BEEN
ROBBED 17 TIMES.

31:03.820 --> 31:06.618
ANY ONE OF THOSE TIMES
COULD ACCOUNT FOR THAT BULLET.

31:08.630 --> 31:10.848
TYLER FELL HERE.

31:12.770 --> 31:14.829
ANDY, STAND WHERE
DOV WAS AGAIN.

31:14.870 --> 31:16.895
OKAY.

31:16.940 --> 31:19.067
CAN YOU SEE ME RIGHT NOW?

31:19.110 --> 31:20.236
NO.

31:22.240 --> 31:23.400
HOW ABOUT NOW?

31:23.440 --> 31:25.078
NO.

31:30.580 --> 31:32.138
WHAT ABOUT NOW?

31:36.920 --> 31:38.182
THERE WERE TWO OF THEM.

31:38.230 --> 31:39.686
THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE
BEHIND THE COUNTER.

31:39.730 --> 31:41.618
HE WAS CROUCHED DOWN,
SO DOV COULDN'T SEE HIM.

31:41.660 --> 31:44.527
SO TYLER GETS SHOT,
OTHER GUY PICKS UP THE GUN.

31:44.570 --> 31:45.662
AND THEN RUNS OUT
THE BACK DOOR.

31:45.700 --> 31:47.793
(sighs)
THERE WAS A THIRD MAN.

31:47.830 --> 31:49.832
IT'S POSSIBLE.

31:51.710 --> 31:53.337
IT'S POSSIBLE.

31:59.350 --> 32:01.215
I ASSUME YOU'RE HERE TO TELL US
WHO SHOT MY BROTHER.

32:01.250 --> 32:02.877
WE'RE STILL WORKING ON THAT.

32:02.920 --> 32:04.615
(sighs)
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN--
"YOU'RE STILL WORKING ON IT"?

32:04.650 --> 32:06.584
CRYSTAL.
BECAUSE WE HEARD
IT WAS A COP.

32:06.620 --> 32:09.851
WE--WE CAN'T GIVE ANY DETAILS
RIGHT NOW. I'M SORRY.

32:09.890 --> 32:11.983
UH, TYLER'S FRIENDS--
WAS THERE ANYONE,

32:12.030 --> 32:14.055
UH, HE SPENT A LOT
OF TIME WITH,

32:14.100 --> 32:15.795
MAYBE GOT
INTO A LITTLE TROUBLE WITH?

32:15.830 --> 32:16.922
YOU'RE TRYING TO PUT THIS
ON MY BROTHER.

32:16.960 --> 32:18.029
(Sam) UH, NO.

32:18.070 --> 32:19.469
YOU'RE SAYING
I-IT WAS HIS FAULT.

32:19.500 --> 32:20.797
NO, NO.
WE JUST WANT TO FIND OUT

32:20.830 --> 32:23.663
IF SOMEONE ELSE WAS THERE
WHO SAW WHAT HAPPENED.

32:23.700 --> 32:26.703
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT CORY.

32:26.740 --> 32:28.105
CORY BARN ES.

32:28.140 --> 32:29.437
THEY'VE BEEN BEST FRIENDS
SINCE GRADE TWO.

32:29.480 --> 32:32.449
THEY DID EVERYTHING
TOGETHER.

32:32.480 --> 32:34.641
CORY'S BEEN ARRESTED
A COUPLE OF TIMES.

32:34.680 --> 32:37.114
UH, DO YOU HAVE
AN ADDRESS FOR CORY?

32:37.150 --> 32:39.118
OH, I'M NOT GONNA SPEAK
FOR CORY.

32:39.150 --> 32:40.481
CORY CAN SPEAK FOR HIMSELF.

32:40.520 --> 32:41.817
(papers rustling)
I'LL GET YOU HIS NUMBER.

32:41.860 --> 32:47.321
MOM, DON'T BOTHER.
THEY DON'T CARE.

32:47.360 --> 32:49.157

UH, YEAH.

32:49.200 --> 32:51.327

FOR YOUR TIME.

32:51.370 --> 32:53.691
IF ANYTHING COMES UP,
WE'LL DEFINITELY LET YOU KNOW.

32:53.730 --> 32:55.834
I'M TRYING HARD
TO BELIEVE YOU.

32:55.870 --> 32:57.189
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD,
MOST OF THE TIME,

32:57.240 --> 32:58.502
POLICE ARE THE ENEMY.

33:00.610 --> 33:02.703
WE'RE REALLY SORRY
ABOUT YOUR SON

GIVE YOURSELVES A HAND.

33:21.930 --> 33:23.090

THE RIGHT ADDRESS.

34:39.170 --> 34:40.137

THIS BUILDING'S NOTORIOUS.

34:41.710 --> 34:45.840
BEEN LIT UP WITH GUN CALLS
