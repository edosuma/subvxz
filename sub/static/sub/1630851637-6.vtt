00:23.390 --> 00:26.092

to collide.

00:26.158 --> 00:28.094
- Tie the bottom of the sleeve
or slip-through?

00:28.160 --> 00:29.494
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:29.562 --> 00:30.529
- I can't even do it.

00:30.531 --> 00:31.664

00:31.731 --> 00:34.700
It's a competition.

Time, money, everything.</i>

that that takes a whole lot.

is for both of us?

- Whoa! What?
- If we win.

07:29.748 --> 07:30.882
- That's crazy!
- Yeah!

07:30.950 --> 07:32.050
- I could use that to hire
some help

07:32.118 --> 07:33.519
to get through
all the back orders.

07:33.586 --> 07:35.921
- Yeah, I could use it
to hire some help too, so--

07:35.988 --> 07:38.323
- I've been dreaming of help.
I love these bright colors.

07:38.390 --> 07:39.424
- I love bright.

07:39.492 --> 07:41.694
I want to do some kind of dress
with some ruffle.

07:41.760 --> 07:43.696
And I think with all this
going on,

07:43.762 --> 07:46.097
<i>it might be better just
to color block the shoe.</i>

07:46.165 --> 07:47.999
<i>I was thinking
maybe yellow and white.</i>

07:48.067 --> 07:49.934
And then a different color
on the ribbon,

of Indigenous people.

07:59.112 --> 08:01.646
- I am Creek Indian,
and I'm also Creole.

So I was thinking some type
of tribal print dress.

08:15.794 --> 08:17.128
That way,
you can play off of it.

I have a voice too."

08:27.740 --> 08:30.408

44:49.053 --> 44:50.986
- Growing up in Haiti,
my grandmother,

44:51.054 --> 44:53.322
when she goes to church,
she usually dress

44:53.324 --> 44:55.258
in pencil skirt
with peplum, high heels,

44:55.325 --> 44:57.260
and she used to have gloves
and black pearls.

44:57.327 --> 45:01.330
So today, she is going to
a party at the Haitian Palace,

45:01.332 --> 45:04.133
wearing her fabulous
$25,000 gloves.

45:04.135 --> 45:06.903

45:06.970 --> 45:09.338
Prajjé, did you think about
any other fabric choices

45:09.340 --> 45:10.273
before you landed on this?

45:10.275 --> 45:12.075
- I went through
a few different fabrics,

45:12.142 --> 45:13.944
and then this one moved me.

45:14.010 --> 45:16.145
- It gives me chills.
This look made me happy,

45:16.213 --> 45:18.013
it made me feel more glamorous.

45:18.081 --> 45:20.149
- The way
that the gloves cut off

45:20.217 --> 45:22.052
right where you brought
the waist in

45:22.119 --> 45:24.320
was divine.
- Thank you.

45:24.388 --> 45:26.989
- Did you find the gloves?
Were they already made?

45:26.991 --> 45:28.991
Was that a collaboration?

45:28.993 --> 45:30.326
- No, everything is made.

45:30.394 --> 45:33.896
I bought God knows how much
Swarovski crystals,

45:33.964 --> 45:35.765
and then she showed up
with this leather,

45:35.767 --> 45:37.366
and I'm like,
"Oh, my God, this is it."

45:37.368 --> 45:39.168
So it really truly
was a marriage

45:39.236 --> 45:40.270
between the two of us.

45:40.337 --> 45:42.305
- What I loved was the fact

45:42.307 --> 45:46.142
that you were able to tame
the exuberance of these gloves.

45:46.209 --> 45:48.377
- This is sophisticated glamour,

45:48.445 --> 45:49.980
and it's really timeless.

45:50.046 --> 45:52.649
I could see
Jackie Kennedy Onassis in this,

45:52.716 --> 45:55.252
but I could also see
Lady Gaga wearing this.

46:09.801 --> 46:10.934
- Tell us about
your collaboration.

46:11.001 --> 46:15.072
- So my collaboration was with
a fantastic handbag designer

46:15.138 --> 46:16.673
by the name of Akilah.

46:16.740 --> 46:19.141
And she was telling me
that she's an Indigenous,

46:19.209 --> 46:20.209
as I am an Indigenous too.

46:20.211 --> 46:22.846
- What really threw me off
about this was that

46:22.912 --> 46:24.346
the whole time
I just kept writing, like,

46:24.414 --> 46:26.749
"What is the accessory?"
- Oh, okay.

46:26.751 --> 46:30.020
<i>- And I think because the
earrings were so overpowering,</i>

46:30.086 --> 46:31.921
and because of all the fabric
in the dress,

46:31.989 --> 46:33.890
<i>like, I didn't really see
the bag.</i>

46:33.957 --> 46:35.826
- Did you line the bag?

46:35.892 --> 46:37.860
- The artist actually
lined the bag.

46:37.928 --> 46:38.928
- I love that.

46:38.930 --> 46:42.164
But I cannot see the bag.
- Mm-hmm.

46:42.232 --> 46:44.500
- I think
a more cohesive styling

46:44.502 --> 46:45.835
would have helped you.

46:45.837 --> 46:47.703
- I think the construction
of the dress

46:47.771 --> 46:49.905
isn't necessarily
the best fit for her.

46:49.973 --> 46:52.241
The way the V-neck is falling

46:52.309 --> 46:55.311
could be
a little bit more thoughtful.

46:55.378 --> 46:58.048
Can you turn around?
I love the sleeve.

46:58.114 --> 46:59.882
I think that looks really nice

46:59.950 --> 47:02.885
and has great movement
with the dress.

47:02.953 --> 47:04.855
- Zayden, I don't think this
deserves to be in the bottom.

47:04.921 --> 47:06.188
- Oh!
- But we are at this point

47:06.256 --> 47:07.390
in the competition where...
- Thank you, yeah.

47:07.457 --> 47:09.025
- It's, like--
- Yeah.

47:09.092 --> 47:10.859
And I know it was the editing.
Like--

47:10.861 --> 47:11.927
- It's the editing.

47:11.995 --> 47:13.329
You know, that old adage,

47:13.396 --> 47:16.900
that Coco Chanel quote
about taking off one thing...

47:16.966 --> 47:18.267
- Yes.
- Before you leave the house.

47:18.335 --> 47:21.371
And in fact, if there is a way
to take off one of her earrings

47:21.438 --> 47:23.339
to show us
what it would look like--

47:23.341 --> 47:26.075
Ooh, and see it already looks
so much better.

47:26.143 --> 47:28.211
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Zayden.

47:28.278 --> 47:29.278
Rachel, you can
leave the runway.

47:29.346 --> 47:30.813
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

47:30.815 --> 47:32.148
<i>- All right, the next look</i>

47:32.150 --> 47:35.951
was collectively
one of our favorites.

47:36.019 --> 47:38.420
- Oh, my gosh. Wow.

47:38.488 --> 47:40.990
- Coral, that red was amazing.
- Yeah.

47:42.158 --> 47:43.959
- Oh, yeah.

47:44.027 --> 47:46.028
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

47:46.030 --> 47:48.231
I've been waiting for this
for so long.

47:48.298 --> 47:49.833
For a very, very long time.

47:49.900 --> 47:51.100
- So have we.

47:51.167 --> 47:52.434
Tell us
about your collaboration.

47:52.502 --> 47:55.438
- My designer is
a luxury headpiece.

47:55.505 --> 47:57.773
She created this hat.

47:57.841 --> 48:01.009
And then my inspiration
for this dress,

48:01.078 --> 48:02.444
it was mystery.

48:02.512 --> 48:06.315
I was thinking of, like,
a Spanish woman.

48:06.383 --> 48:07.917
And the mystery is,

48:07.919 --> 48:10.853
at the beginning of COVID,
we had this disease,

48:10.855 --> 48:13.188
and we didn't know
anything about it.

48:13.256 --> 48:16.192
During the pandemic,
I had my own line of clothing,

48:16.194 --> 48:18.527
and through 2020,
I only sold one dress,

48:18.595 --> 48:21.263
and I was really stressed
and very sad,

48:21.331 --> 48:24.267
because I thought that maybe
I had to give up fashion.

48:24.334 --> 48:27.403
I'm sorry.
And it was--it was hard.

48:27.470 --> 48:29.538
- I have not had the chance
to meet you

48:29.540 --> 48:32.142
because you have been safe.
- Yes.

48:32.208 --> 48:36.445
- But I noticed that you used
this macrame work

48:36.513 --> 48:39.148
almost as a signature
to your designs.

48:39.215 --> 48:40.215
- Yes.

48:40.283 --> 48:42.151
- They're actually
very beautiful.

48:42.219 --> 48:44.487
- Thank you.
- I love this outfit.

48:44.554 --> 48:48.190
<i>I immediately got
the Spanish vibe</i>

48:48.258 --> 48:52.228
with the red mantilla
over the headpiece.

48:52.230 --> 48:55.965
And you do this work
with the rope that is so you.

48:55.967 --> 49:00.035
- So is it really meant to be
more of a structure

49:00.103 --> 49:04.106
that supports the veil
more so than a hat on its own?

49:04.108 --> 49:05.507
- Yes.
- Okay.

49:05.575 --> 49:07.176
- Like, anybody could
take this dress now--

49:07.243 --> 49:08.243
Not you, Steven.

49:08.311 --> 49:10.379
Or if you want, but not--
The ladies in the middle--

49:10.447 --> 49:12.615
And you would be
best-dressed list today.

49:12.617 --> 49:14.483
[laughter]

49:14.485 --> 49:17.853
- I think it's a beautiful,
sexy, sophisticated dress

49:17.921 --> 49:20.556
that speaks to your family,
that speaks to your culture,

49:20.624 --> 49:23.392
that brings a voice
to fashion that we need.

49:23.460 --> 49:25.928
And I can see that dress
on a red carpet.

49:25.930 --> 49:27.596
- I'm honored.
Thank you so much.

49:27.664 --> 49:29.198
- Thank you, Coral.

49:29.265 --> 49:31.268
And Roberta,
you can leave the runway.

49:34.137 --> 49:37.206
Unfortunately, the next look
got one of our lowest scores.

49:40.878 --> 49:42.144
- Aww.

49:42.146 --> 49:43.412
- It's okay.
- I love your dress.

49:43.480 --> 49:45.347
- Me too.
- He is gonna flip out.

49:45.415 --> 49:47.183
- Please don't flip out.

49:47.250 --> 49:49.918
- So my collaborator's name
is Ashaka Givens,

49:49.986 --> 49:52.021
and she is a hat designer.

49:52.023 --> 49:54.490
And we went with,
like, this idea of

49:54.558 --> 49:56.158
they're going to the Met Gala,

49:56.160 --> 49:57.893
and the theme is water and wave.

49:57.961 --> 49:59.495
- How do you feel
about your look?

49:59.562 --> 50:02.131
- If I didn't love my looks,
I would not put them up here.

50:02.198 --> 50:03.632
So yeah,
I absolutely love this dress.

50:03.700 --> 50:06.503
- There is something really
interesting

50:06.569 --> 50:08.971
about your eye
and about your ideas.

50:08.973 --> 50:11.907
I think the garment itself

50:11.975 --> 50:14.176
isn't particularly flattering
on her.

50:14.178 --> 50:16.612
It sort of feels like
she's swimming in fabric.

50:16.614 --> 50:17.580
I wouldn't wear it,

50:17.647 --> 50:21.184
and I can't
imagine who would wear it.

50:21.251 --> 50:24.987
- The centerpiece here
is the hat.

50:24.989 --> 50:26.922
<i>We don't have a focus.</i>

50:26.990 --> 50:28.524
<i>You're over-staging the hat,</i>

50:28.592 --> 50:31.461
and the hat
is over-staging the dress.

50:31.528 --> 50:33.262
- If you turn around
for a second,

50:33.264 --> 50:35.264
that bottom panel there,
it felt like that was,

50:35.331 --> 50:37.599
like, a last-minute sew-on
to something.

50:37.667 --> 50:39.903
And then if you come
to the front again,

50:39.969 --> 50:42.638
it felt disconnected,
and I was confused.

50:42.706 --> 50:45.674
- And that was put on today
in, like, the last 30 minutes.

50:45.676 --> 50:51.013
- I think that
what is happening is that,

50:51.015 --> 50:54.284
through the competition,
you're also using

50:54.350 --> 50:58.354
each challenge to challenge
yourself to find yourself.

50:58.356 --> 51:00.222
- I don't mean to say this,

51:00.290 --> 51:02.224
but I've gotten this statement
twice from you now,

51:02.226 --> 51:03.358
and so it's always interesting,

51:03.426 --> 51:05.427
because I'm like,
I know who I am.

51:05.429 --> 51:07.029
I know who I want
to put this dress on.

51:07.096 --> 51:10.065
So when I hear this statement
of, like, "Find yourself,"

51:10.133 --> 51:11.700
it does kind of confuse me,

51:11.768 --> 51:13.969
because I'm secure in who I am
and, like, what I want to make.

51:14.037 --> 51:15.437
- Yeah.
- And maybe it's, like,

51:15.439 --> 51:17.240
the refining of the voice
that you're talking about,

51:17.307 --> 51:19.109
so maybe that's why
I'm not understanding.

51:19.175 --> 51:21.644
- My particular comment about it

51:21.711 --> 51:23.579
was I think
most of what's been said--

51:23.646 --> 51:26.316
Is that it was a lot of fabric
compared to the hat.

51:26.382 --> 51:27.250
And this was

51:27.317 --> 51:29.051
an accessories challenge--
[thunder booms]

51:29.053 --> 51:30.719
Ooh!
- [gasps]

51:30.787 --> 51:33.322
- Wow.
- I'm bringing the rain, honey.

51:43.300 --> 51:44.199
<i>- Ooh!</i>

51:44.267 --> 51:45.734
[laughs]

51:45.736 --> 51:47.402
- Oh, my God.

51:47.470 --> 51:52.307
- That is intense.
- Storms give me major anxiety.

51:52.375 --> 51:54.543
We're very clear on
who Bones is,

51:54.545 --> 51:55.811
and that we love.

51:55.879 --> 51:57.313
And so with the clothes,

51:57.380 --> 51:58.547
it's gotta match

51:58.549 --> 51:59.815
at the same time, going forward.

51:59.883 --> 52:00.883
Does that make sense?

52:00.950 --> 52:03.685
- I appreciate the feedback,
100%, from everyone.

52:03.753 --> 52:07.189
There are a lot of ideas,
and, like, I love all them.

52:08.658 --> 52:11.393
- Oh, my God.

52:11.395 --> 52:13.195
- Thank you so much, Bones.

52:14.431 --> 52:15.764
Let's bring out another one

52:15.766 --> 52:17.633
of our least favorite
designs tonight.

52:17.635 --> 52:20.569
<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

52:20.637 --> 52:25.507
<i>♪ ♪</i>

52:25.509 --> 52:27.310
- Oh, here's Katie.

52:27.377 --> 52:30.579
- So this is my fabric
that I brought from home.

52:30.647 --> 52:32.314
I created the second textile

52:32.382 --> 52:34.449
by piecing pieces
of linen together.

52:34.517 --> 52:36.685
And then the shoes
were my collaboration

52:36.753 --> 52:39.187
with Loyal Brand Shoes.

52:39.189 --> 52:42.257
- I'd love to hear your process
of making this print.

52:42.259 --> 52:43.525
- This is from a painting
that I made.

52:43.593 --> 52:44.727
It's a watercolor.

52:44.729 --> 52:47.295
- Honestly, it might have been
a fabric choice issue.

52:47.364 --> 52:50.332
Like, if this was
a lighter weight or sheer,

52:50.400 --> 52:53.201
it could have been really
ethereal and beautiful.

52:53.203 --> 52:57.339
And it sort of stood out
as not as elevated, frankly.

52:57.407 --> 52:59.541
- The dress doesn't feel
really thought-out.

52:59.543 --> 53:01.877
<i>It kind of seems
very heavy on the top.</i>

53:01.945 --> 53:03.478
<i>And it's baggy.</i>

53:03.546 --> 53:05.547
<i>Maybe more, like, something
cinched at the waist.</i>

53:05.549 --> 53:07.183
Maybe, instead of the buttons,

53:07.251 --> 53:09.352
maybe there's a little bit
of a V-neck there...

53:09.419 --> 53:12.421
- Like, I would not have
cut that dress there.

53:12.489 --> 53:15.090
I would have kind of made it
one straight hem,

53:15.158 --> 53:16.625
and maybe I would
have belted it.

53:16.693 --> 53:19.829
I see what you're wearing.
I'm sure that's your dress.

53:19.896 --> 53:22.565
And I'm like, "Well that's
a perfectly fine dress."

53:22.632 --> 53:25.167
- Everyone said this length
was matronly.

53:25.169 --> 53:27.469
Well--and I'm like, "Well,
I guess I'm matronly then."

53:27.471 --> 53:28.704
- No!

53:28.772 --> 53:29.705
- Honestly, the hem of the dress

53:29.707 --> 53:32.308
looks like you
trying to explain the dress.

53:32.375 --> 53:33.408
Like, you're neither here
nor there.

53:33.476 --> 53:34.343
You don't know.
You were listening

53:34.410 --> 53:36.378
to that person,
listening to this person.

53:36.446 --> 53:39.715
And, like, that is so crucial.

53:39.782 --> 53:41.650
- Thank you, Katie.
- Thank you.

53:41.718 --> 53:43.919
- Sarah, you can
leave the runway.

53:43.987 --> 53:44.721
All right, guys.

53:44.787 --> 53:46.789
One of the highest scores
of the night

53:46.791 --> 53:48.557
belongs to the next designer.

53:50.527 --> 53:52.862
- I told you.

53:52.929 --> 53:54.796
- Kristina.
- Yeah, I knew.

53:54.864 --> 53:55.831
It was amazing.

53:55.833 --> 53:58.800
- My collaboration was
a shoe designer, Lauren.

53:58.868 --> 54:02.472
So she had this classical shoe

54:02.538 --> 54:04.640
with this wave line
in the middle.

54:04.707 --> 54:07.509
And I'm very happy what she did.

54:07.511 --> 54:09.679
- Was the handbag
also a creation

54:09.746 --> 54:10.880
of the accessory designers?

54:10.947 --> 54:14.283
- No, the handbag is--
- Is that you?

54:14.350 --> 54:15.817
- Her.
- Yeah, it's me. Like--

54:15.885 --> 54:16.752
- So then, is this, like,

54:16.820 --> 54:18.587
your high-fashion version
of a paper bag?

54:18.655 --> 54:21.424
- Yeah. This is the version.

54:21.491 --> 54:23.825
- Oh, my God.
- I'm here for it.

54:23.893 --> 54:26.495
It wasn't the challenge
today, Kristina,

54:26.563 --> 54:29.498
but honorable mention to that.

54:29.565 --> 54:32.434
- Can I look at it
without the jacket?

54:32.502 --> 54:34.369
- So what is it
around the waist?

54:34.437 --> 54:35.704
- It's a shirt.

54:35.772 --> 54:37.973
Kristina, I love a designer

54:38.041 --> 54:41.777
that can think cohesively
from head to toe

54:41.779 --> 54:46.249
and deliver a look that is
absolutely runway-ready.

54:46.316 --> 54:47.717
- Thank you, Nina.

54:47.784 --> 54:50.652
- Oftentimes, the shoe
is like an afterthought.

54:50.720 --> 54:52.789
And you were really trying
to balance--

54:52.855 --> 54:56.125
Like, making sure that
the look doesn't overpower,

54:56.192 --> 54:57.559
and that it works well together.

54:57.561 --> 54:59.362
Very, very smart.
- Thank you.

54:59.428 --> 55:01.429
- Because it's a jacket,
a top, and a pant,

55:01.498 --> 55:02.865
it's also pretty versatile.

55:02.932 --> 55:05.801
You could wear the jacket
my itself or the top by itself

55:05.803 --> 55:07.536
or the pant by itself.

55:07.603 --> 55:09.538
And that's something
your woman loves.

55:09.605 --> 55:11.873
She loves the versatility
of your clothes.

55:11.941 --> 55:14.744
- Thank you so much.
- Congratulations, Kristina.

55:14.811 --> 55:16.545
Your model can leave the runway.

55:16.613 --> 55:17.480
All right, are you ready

55:17.547 --> 55:20.615
for one of the highest scores
of the night?

55:20.683 --> 55:21.618
- Yes.

55:21.684 --> 55:22.684
- Let's get them
out on the runway.

55:22.752 --> 55:27.323
- Awoo! Yes, DD.
- DD.

55:27.391 --> 55:28.691
- Serve us a hat bag.

55:28.758 --> 55:30.293
- [laughs]

55:30.360 --> 55:32.427
- Yay.

55:32.495 --> 55:35.964
- I feel like this challenge
was made for you.

55:35.966 --> 55:39.768
I mean, for a person
obsessed with hats, obviously.

55:39.836 --> 55:40.703
- Right.

55:40.770 --> 55:43.705
- Is that a seatbelt buckle
around her waist?

55:43.707 --> 55:45.240
- You can kind of call it that.

55:45.308 --> 55:48.377
He weaved this, so he just
brought me the pieces today,

55:48.444 --> 55:51.913
and I was able to sew them on
really quick and snap them up.

55:51.981 --> 55:53.715
- Do you feel that this
is indicative

55:53.783 --> 55:56.051
of who you are as a designer,
in terms of this silhouette?

55:56.119 --> 55:59.788
- Yes, because I still played
with ruffles,

55:59.856 --> 56:03.258
and, you know, I still--
Black and white and flowy,

56:03.326 --> 56:04.893
and it's totally my aesthetic.

56:04.961 --> 56:06.662
- This was like a lesson
in geometry.

56:06.664 --> 56:09.432
You have the triangle,
the circle, the square,

56:09.498 --> 56:11.600
the oval, and it all works.

56:11.667 --> 56:14.536
<i>And the way the dress moved
was so natural.</i>

56:14.604 --> 56:15.672
<i>Really well-made.</i>

56:15.738 --> 56:18.807
Everything was so much larger
than life.

56:18.875 --> 56:21.678
Very well-curated.
It was a runway moment.

56:21.744 --> 56:22.945
- It translates.

56:22.947 --> 56:24.480
And that we immediately
understand

56:24.547 --> 56:26.615
who this woman is,
where she's going,

56:26.683 --> 56:27.949
and we just want to live
with her in that world.

56:28.017 --> 56:29.951
- Right.
- Thank you, Octavio.

56:30.019 --> 56:32.621
DD, you can leave the runway.

56:32.689 --> 56:33.688
Okay, designers,

56:33.756 --> 56:37.626
you have made this
so incredibly difficult for us,

56:37.693 --> 56:40.562
so we need time to deliberate.
You can leave the runway.

56:40.630 --> 56:41.831
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

56:41.898 --> 56:42.964
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

56:43.032 --> 56:44.499
Well done.

56:44.567 --> 56:47.168
- Whoo!

56:47.170 --> 56:49.872
- I know.
I'm so happy for her.

56:52.442 --> 56:54.843
- All right, so let's start
with our favorites.

56:54.845 --> 56:57.445
Should we start with Coral?

56:57.447 --> 56:59.781
- It was gorgeous
from the front.

56:59.849 --> 57:01.417
<i>It was a surprise from the back.</i>

57:01.485 --> 57:03.852
<i>- She uses that macrame.</i>

57:03.920 --> 57:06.855
That is part
of her fashion language.

57:06.857 --> 57:08.490
<i>- There was something
about the headpiece</i>

57:08.558 --> 57:10.393
<i>that didn't quite land.</i>

57:10.460 --> 57:12.594
It felt a little bit
too theatrical.

57:12.596 --> 57:15.298
- Was it too theatrical?
I don't know.

57:15.364 --> 57:18.600
But I was really moved
by the craft.

57:18.602 --> 57:22.070
And that's a talent that
we don't see in fashion a lot.

57:22.072 --> 57:24.673
- We have got to talk
about my boy Prajjé,

57:24.741 --> 57:27.676
because that floral glove
took my breath away.

57:27.678 --> 57:30.279
<i>It was amazing,
and he did not try to compete</i>

57:30.346 --> 57:32.481
<i>with the drama of the accessory.</i>

57:32.548 --> 57:34.417
- When you look at his look,

57:34.484 --> 57:36.819
connect it to the gloves--
Was just timeless.

57:36.886 --> 57:38.687
<i>- It felt like a moment of,
like,</i>

57:38.755 --> 57:40.957
throwing somebody's
grandmother's dress on,

57:41.023 --> 57:44.426
and it really had
that very nostalgic feeling.

57:44.494 --> 57:48.096
- There's a little bit of
a borderline costume

57:48.098 --> 57:50.565
to this look.
- Mm.

57:50.633 --> 57:52.835
- Okay, so we have
to talk about Kristina.

57:52.902 --> 57:56.204
<i>- The look itself sold me
on that accessory.</i>

57:56.206 --> 57:57.974
<i>You really want
to sell those shoes,</i>

57:58.040 --> 57:59.841
<i>because that is
a very profitable business.</i>

57:59.909 --> 58:03.379
- Even where she tapered
the pant

58:03.446 --> 58:06.581
so that the bootie looked cool.

58:06.649 --> 58:08.783
<i>- Like, each of those
pieces work separately...</i>

58:08.851 --> 58:09.851
- Yes.
- So she's really thinking

58:09.853 --> 58:10.785
about the business.

58:10.853 --> 58:12.721
<i>- It was so modern.</i>

58:12.789 --> 58:15.792
She gave us
comfortable high fashion.

58:15.858 --> 58:20.595
- Another designer that really
could take this is Octavio.

58:20.663 --> 58:21.730
<i>- Yes.
- I just loved</i>

58:21.797 --> 58:22.865
<i>how graphic it was.</i>

58:22.932 --> 58:24.800
<i>I loved how editorial it was.</i>

58:24.802 --> 58:27.769
- But was I pulled in
because of the drama

58:27.771 --> 58:28.571
and the height and the walk?

58:28.638 --> 58:31.507
Or was I pulled in
because I really thought

58:31.575 --> 58:34.543
it was the best look
for tonight's winner?

58:36.880 --> 58:40.816
- Now, between Zayden, Katie,
and Bones,

58:40.818 --> 58:43.519
who is going home today?

58:43.587 --> 58:46.087
Zayden, he made a bad choice

58:46.155 --> 58:47.889
<i>with those accessories.</i>

58:47.957 --> 58:49.824
<i>He piled it on
a little too thick.</i>

58:49.892 --> 58:51.527
<i>- We have all spiraled out
at the end,</i>

58:51.595 --> 58:52.694
<i>and think, like, this earring</i>

58:52.762 --> 58:54.829
will bring it all together,

58:54.897 --> 58:57.032
and you're not clear enough
to realize

58:57.100 --> 58:59.034
that it's actually
gonna bring it all down.

58:59.102 --> 59:00.502
- And maybe he could
have worked a little bit

59:00.570 --> 59:02.704
on the cut so it was
a little bit more subtle.

59:02.706 --> 59:04.906
- I think he just went
off the rails,

59:04.908 --> 59:07.476
in terms of the styling.

59:07.478 --> 59:10.045
<i>- Katie almost got there.</i>

59:10.047 --> 59:13.549
<i>But then the high-low hem
was just the spiral out.</i>

59:13.617 --> 59:15.417
- The idea that she sent

59:15.419 --> 59:20.121
<i>yet another cotton frock
with that bib detailing--</i>

59:20.189 --> 59:22.057
She might be
a one-note designer.

59:22.124 --> 59:23.825
- I really do like her.

59:23.827 --> 59:25.860
You know, it's hard
to find a designer

59:25.928 --> 59:28.797
that can play with color
and prints like she does.

59:28.865 --> 59:31.800
<i>I don't think
she trusts herself.</i>

59:31.867 --> 59:34.202
<i>- Bones thought his look
was a Met Gala look,</i>

59:34.204 --> 59:36.872
<i>and I think
that is highly debatable.</i>

59:36.874 --> 59:41.577
- I think his look today
really lacked vision.

59:41.579 --> 59:46.549
<i>There was so much that
it overshadowed the accessory.</i>

59:46.616 --> 59:50.752
- I personally think the only
desirable aspect of that look

59:50.820 --> 59:52.621
<i>was the sparkly sleeve.</i>

59:52.623 --> 59:54.956
I wanted to cut through
all the rest of that fabric

59:55.024 --> 59:57.625
and open it up and see
what was underneath there.

59:57.627 --> 1:00:00.495
- He's incredibly confident,
maybe too confident,

1:00:00.563 --> 1:00:02.897
and he needs to maybe
listen to advice more.

1:00:02.965 --> 1:00:04.766
- Knowing who you are
as a person,

1:00:04.768 --> 1:00:06.234
which he has
a very clear idea of,

1:00:06.236 --> 1:00:08.236
and knowing who you are
as a designer

1:00:08.238 --> 1:00:10.038
are two very separate things.

1:00:10.106 --> 1:00:11.973
<i>And that is what concerns me.</i>

1:00:12.041 --> 1:00:15.811
- I think that every season
we get to this point

1:00:15.878 --> 1:00:17.979
where we have to make a decision

1:00:18.047 --> 1:00:20.782
about who we're investing in
as a designer.

1:00:20.850 --> 1:00:22.651
<i>Who do we believe
has more promise,</i>

1:00:22.718 --> 1:00:25.821
in terms of longevity
in their career?

1:00:25.888 --> 1:00:28.123
Okay, we all know
who's going home, right?

1:00:29.693 --> 1:00:31.160
Okay.
Let's get them back out here.

1:00:39.468 --> 1:00:41.704
<i>[suspenseful music]</i>

1:00:41.770 --> 1:00:43.905
- Prajjé,

1:00:43.907 --> 1:00:45.874
Coral,

1:00:45.941 --> 1:00:48.077
Kristina,

1:00:48.144 --> 1:00:50.679
and Octavio.

1:00:50.746 --> 1:00:52.614
We loved
each of your looks tonight.

1:00:52.682 --> 1:00:54.549
All: Thank you.

1:00:54.617 --> 1:00:56.818
- The winner of this challenge
brought the best

1:00:56.820 --> 1:00:58.087
out of their accessory

1:00:58.154 --> 1:01:01.923
and had a cohesive, beautiful,
and contemporary look.

1:01:01.925 --> 1:01:04.226
To help support
your small businesses,

1:01:04.293 --> 1:01:09.231
one of you will take home
$25,000 to split

1:01:09.233 --> 1:01:11.933
with your fellow

thanks to Visa.

1:01:25.749 --> 1:01:27.115
- Congratulations.

1:01:27.183 --> 1:01:29.685
- You win immunity
for next challenge.

1:01:29.687 --> 1:01:32.788

I don't have any words.
Thank you.

1:01:39.896 --> 1:01:43.332
- Prajjé, Coral, and Octavio,
you're also in.

1:01:43.399 --> 1:01:45.267
You can all leave the runway.

1:01:45.269 --> 1:01:47.870
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1:01:47.937 --> 1:01:50.805
- I feel really great
to win this challenge.

1:01:50.807 --> 1:01:51.874
- She won.

1:01:51.941 --> 1:01:54.910
- The paper bag!
- No. Really?

1:01:54.912 --> 1:01:57.645
- Oh, my God.

1:01:57.713 --> 1:02:00.081
- When you're trying to say
something

1:02:00.149 --> 1:02:02.751
<i>and judges really see that,</i>

1:02:02.753 --> 1:02:04.886
that's everything
for a designer.

1:02:04.954 --> 1:02:09.724
- Can I borrow some money?
[laughter]

1:02:09.792 --> 1:02:12.294
- Bones, Zayden, and Katie.

1:02:12.361 --> 1:02:16.231
You each made critical mistakes
in your design

1:02:16.298 --> 1:02:18.099
and in your styling.

1:02:18.167 --> 1:02:20.268
One of you will be out.

1:02:24.373 --> 1:02:27.042

1:02:27.044 --> 1:02:28.810
you are in.

1:02:28.878 --> 1:02:29.912
You can leave the runway.

1:02:29.979 --> 1:02:31.379
- Just take off one thing

1:02:31.447 --> 1:02:34.015
before you send her
down the runway next time.

1:02:34.017 --> 1:02:36.084
- I listen.
Thank you so much.

1:02:40.956 --> 1:02:44.125
- Katie, you're continuously
listening to voices

1:02:44.193 --> 1:02:46.060
that are not your own,

1:02:46.128 --> 1:02:49.198
and your look tonight embodied
that confusion.

1:02:51.067 --> 1:02:54.269
Bones, your dress
had too many ideas

1:02:54.336 --> 1:02:57.006
and overwhelmed your accessory.

1:03:00.977 --> 1:03:02.211
Bones...

1:03:11.020 --> 1:03:12.621

1:03:16.058 --> 1:03:18.094
I appreciate it.
And I will edit.

1:03:18.160 --> 1:03:21.296
- Work on that vision.
- I will definitely do so.

1:03:21.364 --> 1:03:24.032

I appreciate it.

I am sorry to see you go.

1:03:39.782 --> 1:03:43.318
- Thank you.
I appreciate this opportunity.

1:03:43.386 --> 1:03:45.119
I have never done a runway show.

1:03:45.187 --> 1:03:46.921
I've never dressed a model.

1:03:46.989 --> 1:03:49.123
I didn't go to fashion school.

1:03:49.191 --> 1:03:51.059

walking away

And I hope that you learn
to trust yourself

1:03:57.401 --> 1:04:00.869

1:04:00.936 --> 1:04:02.337

- Good luck, Katie.

I regret letting all the voices
crowd out my own voice.

- Katie bee!

from all of you guys.
