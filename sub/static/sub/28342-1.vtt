00:02.043 --> 00:02.960
REPORTER:
The United States of America

00:03.043 --> 00:05.126
has a new president...
Laura Montez.

00:05.418 --> 00:06.627
I hate this country.

00:07.293 --> 00:10.168
We've gotten so close.
It was devastating.

00:10.251 --> 00:14.460
But I did reacquaint myself
with an old friend of mine

00:14.543 --> 00:16.794
by the name of Selina Meyer.

00:17.627 --> 00:19.627
And I like her. (CHUCKLES)

00:21.710 --> 00:24.627
-You look absolutely radiant!
-Oh, thank you.

00:24.710 --> 00:26.543
Yes, your stay
in the insane asylum?

00:26.627 --> 00:28.543
-It's really agreed with you.
-Oh, it was a spa.

00:29.085 --> 00:30.293
SELINA MEYER:
This is the second act.

00:30.377 --> 00:32.000
Selina Meyer travels the globe,

00:32.085 --> 00:34.126
spreading democracy
like patient zero.

00:34.585 --> 00:36.502
Ma'am,
you can't run for president.

00:36.585 --> 00:39.210
Uh, you don't have
the party support. It's over.

00:39.293 --> 00:41.251
Well, I was speaking
hypothetically.

00:41.919 --> 00:42.919
I want a library.

00:43.168 --> 00:45.293
I'm the only living president
who doesn't have one.

00:45.627 --> 00:47.627
Nobody gives me any respect.

00:47.960 --> 00:48.919
How about that?

00:49.001 --> 00:50.835
CROWD: (CHANTING)
No justice, no library!

00:51.210 --> 00:53.251
Who despises me like this?!

00:53.335 --> 00:55.710
Well, there's President Montez,
Tom James--

00:55.794 --> 00:57.293
The White House maids,
the stewards.

00:57.377 --> 00:58.710
White working-class voters.

00:59.168 --> 01:01.126
Jonah, my boy,
I've come to say farewell.

01:01.210 --> 01:03.877
-I'm pulling
all my financial support.
-Ow!

01:03.960 --> 01:05.126
Let's send them a message,

01:05.376 --> 01:07.627
by shoving the guy
that they hate the most

01:07.877 --> 01:10.168
right back in their faces.
Thank you!

01:10.627 --> 01:12.168
-Advance copies!
-Really?

01:12.251 --> 01:13.502
My book, my book, my book!

01:13.585 --> 01:15.585
-Woman First, First Woman.
-Yeah!

01:15.669 --> 01:17.377
You'd get murdered in my country
for saying something like that.

01:17.669 --> 01:19.710
Remember a couple months ago
after you got fired,

01:19.794 --> 01:21.585
-we had drinks with Ben?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:21.669 --> 01:23.669
Yeah, well, I'm pregnant.
And it's yours.

01:24.168 --> 01:26.585
Marjorie and I
are having a baby.

01:26.669 --> 01:27.960
RICHARD SPLETT: I can't believe
I'm gonna be a father.

01:28.043 --> 01:29.085
Lotta responsibility.

01:29.168 --> 01:30.710
You just signed away
all responsibility.

01:30.794 --> 01:32.919
Say hello to little Richard.

01:33.168 --> 01:37.085
It was President Selina Meyer
who negotiated to free Tibet.

01:37.168 --> 01:40.251
-They finally know it's me!
-Oh, my gosh!

01:40.335 --> 01:42.126
I've been rethinking things.

01:42.335 --> 01:44.460
And there are some new options
for me.

01:44.669 --> 01:48.001
The options would be easier
without any baggage.

01:49.168 --> 01:52.585
I'm running for president!

01:52.669 --> 01:54.585
The band is getting back
together again!

01:54.669 --> 01:56.126
I do need to talk to you
about your role.

01:56.210 --> 01:58.335
-To Team Meyer.
-ALL: Team Meyer!

01:58.418 --> 02:00.251
Well, second time's the charm.

02:00.335 --> 02:01.502
Uh, it's actually the fourth.

02:01.585 --> 02:03.710
-Yeah, fourth time's the charm.
-Yeah, it's fourth.

02:09.960 --> 02:11.502
Selina:
It's just incredible.

02:11.585 --> 02:13.168
"New Selina."

02:13.251 --> 02:15.794
- All: "Now."
- Oh, it's perfect!

02:15.877 --> 02:17.418
I don't really get it, actually.

02:17.502 --> 02:18.794
Ma'am, we're so far ahead
in the polls

02:18.877 --> 02:20.043
and you're
not even running yet.

02:20.126 --> 02:21.585
SHEILA couldn't agree more.

02:21.669 --> 02:22.794
Hey, Kent's dating again.

02:22.877 --> 02:25.126
No, SHEILA is my
predictive computer model

02:25.210 --> 02:26.460
- for election results.
- Selina: No. No.

02:26.543 --> 02:28.669
Strategic Hypermetric
Electoral Interactive

02:28.752 --> 02:29.710
Logistical Algorithm.

02:29.794 --> 02:30.960
I don't want nuts.

02:31.043 --> 02:33.168
I like her more
than I like the deaf girl.

02:33.251 --> 02:35.835
- Whatever happened to her?
- The police have no leads.

02:35.919 --> 02:38.043
- Gary: Here you go, ma'am.
- I still need my speech.

02:38.126 --> 02:40.293
- Leon: It's printing, ma'am.
- Amy, are you there?

02:40.377 --> 02:41.752
We're all ready for you, ma'am.

02:41.835 --> 02:44.251
Hey! Sweatpants!
You can't just walk out.

02:44.335 --> 02:46.168
This isn't
a Terrence Malick
movie. Sit.

02:46.251 --> 02:49.335
Al right, quiet, everyone.
Mommy's reading.

02:49.418 --> 02:51.960
Dan:
OK, the network's
been properly fluffed.

02:52.043 --> 02:53.585
Told 'em to expect
a surprise announcement

02:53.669 --> 02:55.126
without telling 'em that
she's surprise-announcing.

02:55.210 --> 02:57.502
Maybe after the announcement
we can finally sit down.

02:57.585 --> 02:59.794
There's still
a lot to talk about.

02:59.877 --> 03:01.251
We talk plenty, Amy.

03:01.335 --> 03:02.669
No, not you, ma'am.

03:02.752 --> 03:05.502
I was talking
about the...

03:05.585 --> 03:09.543
What? Jesus, I thought you
sent that thing to the 7-Eleven
dumpster in the sky already.

03:09.627 --> 03:12.543
It's just we've been
so busy with the campaign.
I don't wanna--

03:12.627 --> 03:15.085
Waitin' for the thing
to get into fucking college?!
What are you doing?!

03:15.168 --> 03:18.168
OK, Leon, I'm still--
I'm not sure about this part

03:18.251 --> 03:21.502
where I say I wanna be president
for all  Americans.

03:21.585 --> 03:24.293
I mean, do I? Ya know?
All  of them?

03:24.377 --> 03:27.335
- How about "real Americans"?
- Oh, yeah, that's good.

03:27.418 --> 03:29.627
- And then we can figure out
what I mean later.
- Yeah.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.877
Ma'am, I don't have
a copy of the speech.

03:31.960 --> 03:34.418
OK, I don't know
what she's saying,
so... here.

03:34.502 --> 03:37.126
- Ma'am, the voters
need to know clearly

03:37.210 --> 03:39.085
and definitively
why you want
to be president.

03:39.168 --> 03:41.877
- In your own words.
- If you want me to use
my own goddamn words,

03:41.960 --> 03:44.043
- then write me
something to say. OK?
- Yes, ma'am.

03:44.126 --> 03:46.043
Oh, and take out the stuff
about immigration

03:46.126 --> 03:47.960
'cause I feel like
it's a little too issue-y.

03:48.043 --> 03:48.877
Leon: OK.

03:54.168 --> 03:56.460
Hello, Iowa!

03:56.543 --> 03:59.210
- I'm--
- Selina Meyer.

03:59.293 --> 04:01.877
- Wait a minute.
Where is everyone?
- Maybe they're hiding.

04:01.960 --> 04:03.669
Selina: Wha--

04:03.752 --> 04:05.168
Selina ( over phone ):
Amy? Where are you?

04:05.251 --> 04:06.502
At the airport.
Where are you?

04:06.585 --> 04:08.001
There's only
one fuckin' runway!

04:08.085 --> 04:09.877
I'm at the airport!
We just landed!

04:09.960 --> 04:12.919
- That's not possible.
- Right now I'm standing here,

04:13.001 --> 04:15.085
with my dick  in my hand,

04:15.168 --> 04:17.543
in Cedar... Falls, Iowa!

04:17.627 --> 04:21.084
- Ma'am, we're in Cedar Rapids.
- No!

04:21.168 --> 04:24.710
- This is supposed
to be New Selina!
- Now!

04:26.000 --> 04:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:33.335 --> 04:34.835
If Mohamad Atta

04:34.919 --> 04:37.043
had you  people
booking his travel,

04:37.126 --> 04:39.001
he'd still be alive today.

04:39.085 --> 04:40.543
Which from his perspective,

04:40.627 --> 04:43.001
would be a massive fuck-up.

04:44.502 --> 04:45.919
Ben: Yeah,
it didn't go very well.

04:46.001 --> 04:47.335
- Selina: Ya think?
- Dan: Ma'am, FYI,

04:47.418 --> 04:48.877
we're tracking a school shooting

04:48.960 --> 04:50.251
in Spokane, Washington.

04:50.335 --> 04:52.085
- Muslim or white guy?
- Don't know yet.

04:52.168 --> 04:53.710
- Which is better for me?
- White guy.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.126
Fingers crossed.

04:55.210 --> 04:57.919
OK, guys, what happened
at the airport today

04:58.001 --> 05:00.418
can never, ever  happen again.

05:00.502 --> 05:04.168
And so, as such,
I have had A-- OK.

05:04.251 --> 05:06.293
I have had Amy prepare

05:06.377 --> 05:08.960
a full autopsy
of the last campaign

05:09.043 --> 05:10.794
to specifically identify

05:10.877 --> 05:12.835
problem areas
within the organization.

05:12.919 --> 05:15.585
- OK? So, Amy?
- Thank you, ma'am.

05:15.669 --> 05:18.085
I have put together
a summary list

05:18.168 --> 05:20.835
of what I discovered
were the most egregious

05:20.919 --> 05:23.460
- flaws in our organization.
- I said this already.
This is what I just said.

05:23.543 --> 05:25.543
- Kent: Yeah.
- Great.

05:25.627 --> 05:29.627
First and foremost,
there was a reluctance
on the part of the candidate

05:29.710 --> 05:31.126
to take responsibility
for mistakes.

05:31.210 --> 05:33.251
What? No, you were the one
that made mistakes.

05:33.335 --> 05:34.835
What else? Go on.

05:34.919 --> 05:37.001
Second, there was
a culture of blame

05:37.085 --> 05:39.627
which made people feel unsafe
expressing criticisms.

05:39.710 --> 05:41.251
What dumb asshole said that?

05:41.335 --> 05:44.085
Number three, an unwillingness
to actually discuss strategies

05:44.168 --> 05:45.835
and share ideas
with campaign staff.

05:45.919 --> 05:47.627
- Four--
- Autopsy is now over.

05:47.710 --> 05:49.001
Forget about it.
Oh, my G--

05:49.085 --> 05:50.627
How many pages is this,
500?

05:50.710 --> 05:52.502
How about I  write 500 pages

05:52.585 --> 05:54.752
about how you need
to start wearing concealer?

05:54.835 --> 05:57.669
- Ames, can I get
a copy of that?

05:57.752 --> 06:01.502
Guys, this is not
going to be a repeat
of my last campaign.

06:01.585 --> 06:03.752
- I am New Selina. Exactly.
- Now.

06:03.835 --> 06:06.377
So I'm gonna shake things up.
I'm gonna hire Keith Quinn.

06:06.460 --> 06:08.752
He's already doing oppo
for Kapoor's people.

06:08.835 --> 06:10.085
Then offer him
campaign manager.

06:10.168 --> 06:11.585
I thought I was
your campaign manager.

06:11.669 --> 06:13.168
I thought I was going
to Cedar Falls.

06:13.251 --> 06:14.919
- Cedar Rapids.
- Marjorie: Ma'am, we have

06:15.001 --> 06:16.543
another candidate
announcing for president.

06:16.627 --> 06:19.960
I'm gonna go out on a limb
and say white guy.

06:20.043 --> 06:23.543
I was reminded
of another innovator
by the name of Jesus Christ.

06:23.627 --> 06:25.543
- Thank you.

06:25.627 --> 06:27.251
Two  wheelchair guys behind him?

06:27.335 --> 06:29.543
What, we didn't get the point
with the first one?

06:29.627 --> 06:31.960
- I got it.
- One wheelchair guy,
good for you,

06:32.043 --> 06:33.960
two wheelchair guys,
shame on me.

06:34.043 --> 06:36.627
OK, Keith fucking Quinn?
Are you kiddin' me?

06:36.710 --> 06:39.585
I heard the last campaign
that guy joined, he had
the entire staff fired.

06:39.669 --> 06:41.043
I knew she'd cut my balls off,

06:41.126 --> 06:43.001
I just thought it would be
after we lost Iowa.

06:43.085 --> 06:44.877
Well, campaign's
ahead of schedule.

06:44.960 --> 06:47.210
Ma'am, the Meyer Fund
is now completely wrapped up,

06:47.293 --> 06:49.126
but there were some
accounting issues

06:49.210 --> 06:50.794
that didn't resolve
cleanly.

06:50.877 --> 06:53.126
But that's Andrew's department,
so just give him a call.

06:53.210 --> 06:55.418
His cell phone number
now seems to belong to
a Portuguese gentleman.

06:55.502 --> 06:57.502
Leon:
Ma'am, your non-announcement
this morning

06:57.585 --> 07:00.669
has given us an excellent
opportunity to fix your speech.

07:00.752 --> 07:03.085
- Why do you want
to be president?
- Leon, I've got this.

07:03.168 --> 07:05.418
It's all in my head,
so just don't worry about it.

07:05.502 --> 07:06.543
Sorry.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.752
Why would you want
to be president?

07:08.835 --> 07:11.752
- As the child
of a Native American--
- OK, I get the gist.

07:11.835 --> 07:14.627
Is Little Richard ready to go
and meet some voters?

07:14.710 --> 07:17.543
Mom, you can't keep using
our baby as a campaign prop.

07:17.627 --> 07:19.418
It's just a few more months
in Iowa,

07:19.502 --> 07:22.835
and then we're gonna hide him
when we get to New Hampshire.

07:22.919 --> 07:24.418
- No, no crying.

07:24.502 --> 07:27.085
Mom, you cannot
tell the baby "N-O."

07:27.168 --> 07:28.960
"N-O" is a negative
rejoinder.

07:29.043 --> 07:31.710
We don't want to constrain
Little Richard developmentally--

07:31.794 --> 07:35.460
What are you supposed to say
then when the baby is being
an asshole? For instance.

07:35.543 --> 07:37.335
You're supposed to say,
"That's not our plan."

07:37.418 --> 07:38.919
I don't even
know where to start.

07:39.001 --> 07:41.293
Child Services
is a good place.

07:41.377 --> 07:45.752
Here. Take--
Go back to Mommy #1
or 2 or whatever.

07:45.835 --> 07:48.001
Catherine is Mama,
and I'm Mom-Mom.

07:48.085 --> 07:51.043
You didn't want to go with
Mommy and Agent Palmiotti?

07:51.126 --> 07:54.669
- ( Catherine,
Little Richard crying )
- Catherine.

07:55.877 --> 07:57.126
OK--

07:57.210 --> 07:58.835
I'm sorry about that,
Gam-Gam, ma'am.

07:58.919 --> 08:00.669
Catherine's been suffering
from postpartum depression.

08:00.752 --> 08:03.418
- How can you tell?
- Well, the haircut.

08:03.502 --> 08:04.710
It's been tough
on both of us.

08:04.794 --> 08:06.877
Particularly
on our sex life.

08:06.960 --> 08:09.502
- I've gotta get out of here.
- We still enjoy sex
in the mornings,

08:09.585 --> 08:12.377
but in the evenings,
hardly ever. And rarely
penetrative.

08:12.460 --> 08:13.919
- Oh, Amy?
- Amy.

08:14.001 --> 08:15.001
- Selina: Amy.
- Mm-hmm?

08:15.085 --> 08:17.335
I, uh, just had
to get away from

08:17.418 --> 08:18.794
"Blue is the Most
Annoying Color."

08:18.877 --> 08:21.627
CNN has the current
Spokane death toll at six.

08:21.710 --> 08:24.418
Leon! OK,
I need a statement. Spokane.

08:24.502 --> 08:26.335
- Standard thoughts
and prayers?
- Bull's-eye.

08:26.418 --> 08:27.877
- Ma'am, the speech?
- I know.

08:27.960 --> 08:31.126
Any, why would you
want to be president?

08:31.210 --> 08:33.085
- So I can nuke America.
- Gary: Mm.

08:33.168 --> 08:35.043
- That's actually not bad.
- Pretty good, actually.

08:35.126 --> 08:37.460
- I love you, New Hampshire!

08:37.543 --> 08:40.168
And that's why
I'm skipping the Iowa caucus.

08:40.251 --> 08:42.501
Because I want you,
my home state,

08:42.585 --> 08:43.794
to pick the next president,

08:43.876 --> 08:47.001
and not because
my polls are low there.

08:47.085 --> 08:49.669
And just wait until you see
how we juice the economy

08:49.752 --> 08:52.043
with my new seven-eight-nine
tax plan.

08:52.126 --> 08:54.627
No, it's nine-eight-seven
tax plan.

08:54.710 --> 08:56.502
It's nine percent
sales tax--

08:56.585 --> 08:58.418
The candidate thinks
it's funnier that way.
Wait for it.

08:58.502 --> 09:00.001
Why was six afraid of seven?

09:00.085 --> 09:01.377
Man: Why?

09:01.460 --> 09:05.502
Because of my seven-eight-nine
tax plan.

09:07.627 --> 09:10.001
You know what I always thought
the funniest number was?

09:10.085 --> 09:11.669
( laughs ) Eleven.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.043
Did you guys know
that I got married?

09:13.126 --> 09:14.377
Who wants to meet my brand-new

09:14.460 --> 09:15.627
smokin' hot wife, Beth?

09:15.710 --> 09:17.085
Beth, come on out here.

09:17.168 --> 09:19.377
This is my wife.
And my stepson, Clay.

09:19.460 --> 09:21.877
- Clay, come on up here.

09:21.960 --> 09:23.627
- Go ahead, say something.
- No, thank you.

09:23.710 --> 09:25.085
Yeah, no, you have to.
They'd love it.

09:25.168 --> 09:26.669
You have to.

09:26.752 --> 09:28.919
- Look at how hot she is!
- Beth: Jonie!

09:29.001 --> 09:31.293
- Yeah, I get sprung.
- Oh, gosh!

09:31.377 --> 09:33.126
Beth:
Thank you all so much.

09:33.210 --> 09:35.377
My Jonie, he just
swept me off my feet.

09:35.460 --> 09:38.168
And I know that
when he's elected president,

09:38.251 --> 09:41.877
he's gonna sweep all of the dirt
out of Washington, so...

09:41.960 --> 09:44.251
- we're just gonna need
to find a broom

09:44.335 --> 09:46.585
- that's tall enough for him.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.752
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm.
- Jonah: I just want
to make it clear

09:48.835 --> 09:50.960
- that she does do
all the housework.
- I do.

09:51.043 --> 09:52.543
Thank you, New Hampshire,
thank you for coming.

09:52.627 --> 09:53.752
Thank you!

09:55.877 --> 09:57.627
The wife is really helpful.

09:57.710 --> 09:59.752
She humanizes him,
if that were possible.

09:59.835 --> 10:01.502
Like sunglasses on a dog.

10:01.585 --> 10:03.168
His favorabilities
are up 11%.

10:03.251 --> 10:04.794
Hilarious.

10:04.877 --> 10:06.627
That bump could carry us
right to Super Tuesday.

10:06.710 --> 10:08.418
- Uh-oh.
- Jonah: Stay away from us.

10:08.502 --> 10:09.710
You're lucky my wife is here,

10:09.794 --> 10:11.335
or I'd give you
a berserker beat-down

10:11.418 --> 10:14.168
and I would wipe my ass
with that dumb-looking cardigan.

10:14.251 --> 10:15.585
It's a sweater-vest.

10:15.669 --> 10:17.043
Teddy:
What the hell was that?

10:17.126 --> 10:18.460
I thought you'd
gotten a handle on

10:18.543 --> 10:20.085
the screaming-at-
random-seniors thing.

10:20.168 --> 10:22.210
What, my ex-stepdad?
That guy's such a douche nark.

10:22.293 --> 10:23.460
That's your stepfather?

10:23.543 --> 10:25.293
Yeah, he thinks he can just
come down here

10:25.377 --> 10:28.794
and bask in my meteoric success
just because he's my wife's dad?

10:28.877 --> 10:31.251
Wait, I'm s--
He's your wife's... dad.

10:31.335 --> 10:32.960
You said he was your stepdad.

10:33.043 --> 10:34.126
Yeah, Beth's my stepsister.

10:34.210 --> 10:35.335
Did you guys not know that?

10:38.335 --> 10:40.293
- Oh, no.
- Oh. Oh. Oh.

10:40.377 --> 10:41.543
- Oh, no, no.
- No.

10:41.627 --> 10:42.835
Yeah, her dad married my mom

10:42.919 --> 10:44.293
for like a year when I was 11.

10:44.377 --> 10:46.418
You're killing me, sir.

10:46.502 --> 10:48.043
Look, the point is,
he's a dick.

10:48.126 --> 10:49.460
He gave me a "D" in math

10:49.543 --> 10:51.251
because I have dyslexia,
but for numbers.

10:51.335 --> 10:54.001
And he forced us to go on
all these family vacations

10:54.085 --> 10:55.293
to stupid Hawaii.

10:55.377 --> 10:56.877
- Which island?
- The big one.

10:56.960 --> 10:59.210
Did you do
no oppo research

10:59.293 --> 11:01.251
on our own candidate?
How did this not come up?!

11:01.335 --> 11:02.585
The same reason
it didn't come up

11:02.669 --> 11:04.627
that he moisturizes
with Minotaur semen!

11:04.710 --> 11:06.710
It's not one of
the standard questions
that you ask!

11:06.794 --> 11:08.168
I don't know what
the big deal is here.

11:08.251 --> 11:10.168
It's not like
Beth and I did anything,

11:10.251 --> 11:13.210
unless you count her walking in
while I was whackin' off
all the time.

11:13.293 --> 11:14.585
I wish I was still
in prison.

11:14.669 --> 11:16.377
Are you kidding me?

11:16.460 --> 11:18.293
You 80-story sky raper!

11:18.377 --> 11:19.627
Excuse me, Teddy.

11:19.710 --> 11:22.293
May I speak to you over here
for a moment?

11:22.377 --> 11:24.043
Now? Thank you.

11:27.085 --> 11:28.377
Teddy, we talked about this.

11:28.460 --> 11:30.335
- I'm sorry, sir.
- The only reason you were hired

11:30.418 --> 11:33.877
is because Mr. Tanz told me
you were the best,
and because...?

11:33.960 --> 11:36.669
Because of my court-ordered
chemical castration.

11:36.752 --> 11:38.418
That's right.

11:38.502 --> 11:40.335
- This doin' anything for you?

11:40.418 --> 11:42.293
Huh, right there?
You like that?

11:42.377 --> 11:44.502
Not even a little tickle?
Not even a little move?

11:44.585 --> 11:46.877
- Jonie, you ready to head home?
- Jesus, Beth, I'm working!

11:46.960 --> 11:49.502
Someone gets so cranky
when he doesn't eat.

11:49.585 --> 11:50.752
You're  cranky.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.418
- I have Goldfish.
- Thank you.

11:52.502 --> 11:54.794
- I have string cheese too--
- I want Goldfish.

11:54.877 --> 11:57.502
- Can I have some?
- No. Get your own.

11:57.585 --> 12:00.251
Selina:
Well, it is such an honor
to be here in--

12:00.335 --> 12:02.335
- Gary: Lurlene.
- Lurlene,

12:02.418 --> 12:03.627
and to shake hands with--

12:03.710 --> 12:05.627
- with Mayor, um-- Biscuit.
- Biscuit.

12:05.710 --> 12:07.710
Gosh. I didn't have my breakfast
this morning,

12:07.794 --> 12:10.126
I will admit, so that
makes me quite hungry.

12:12.126 --> 12:14.543
And I'll tell ya something,
um, it's not the--

12:14.627 --> 12:17.251
no, I don't want this--
the first time in politics

12:17.335 --> 12:20.710
that I've had to shake hands
with a complete dog.

12:20.794 --> 12:22.752
Madam President,
how do you respond to people

12:22.835 --> 12:24.710
sick and tired of politicians
offering nothing

12:24.794 --> 12:28.001
but "thoughts and prayers"
when it comes to mass shootings?

12:29.627 --> 12:32.543
Um, well, uh...

12:32.627 --> 12:36.585
my heart goes out to
the families of the victims,

12:36.669 --> 12:39.418
and I want to offer them
my, uh--

12:39.502 --> 12:42.001
um, mindfulness...

12:42.085 --> 12:45.043
and, uh, meditations

12:45.126 --> 12:47.710
un-unto the Lord,
on their behalf...

12:47.794 --> 12:50.043
- Mike McLintock.
Buzzfeed  magazine...
- I know who you are.

12:50.126 --> 12:51.669
- print edition,
- Uh-huh. OK.

12:51.752 --> 12:53.835
- Madam President. Now, will--
- Yes.

12:53.919 --> 12:56.001
Sorry, this is a menu.
Hold on a second.

12:56.085 --> 12:58.585
Great question, Mike.
That's all the time
we have, folks.

12:58.669 --> 13:00.377
The president looks forward
to continuing to meet with

13:00.460 --> 13:02.418
the good people of Iowa
as she contemplates the future.

13:02.502 --> 13:03.585
- Thank you so much, everybody.
- Thank you.

13:03.669 --> 13:05.669
Mike, I really need you
to post

13:05.752 --> 13:07.210
at least ten pieces a day
to the site.

13:07.293 --> 13:09.543
When you say "a day,"
do you mean a day  a day?

13:09.627 --> 13:11.377
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:15.168 --> 13:18.585
- Mike. Workin' for
the enemy, huh?
- Yeah. My new gig.

13:18.669 --> 13:21.085
- It's really nice
to see you, Mike.
- Yeah.

13:22.585 --> 13:24.877
I've been meaning
to email ya.

13:24.960 --> 13:27.460
Google always
filters out my emails,
they think I'm a bot.

13:27.543 --> 13:30.919
Yeah. Well, Ellen's doin' good.
She's learnin' Mandarin.

13:31.001 --> 13:33.585
We night even adopt
another, uh, kid.

13:33.669 --> 13:34.960
"Lurlene." I mean,

13:35.043 --> 13:37.293
even the name sounds like
it's on meth.

13:37.377 --> 13:40.794
Who in their right mind
would live in
this ashtray's anus?

13:40.877 --> 13:42.669
Well, me.
I was lucky enough
to be born here.

13:42.752 --> 13:44.377
What?!
You are from Lurlene?

13:44.460 --> 13:46.460
I just didn't want to brag.
"Boasters are roasters,"

13:46.543 --> 13:47.877
my Grandma Splett
would always say.

13:47.960 --> 13:49.919
She had a form
of rhyming dementia.

13:50.001 --> 13:51.710
It's called Lyndrome Syndrome.

13:51.794 --> 13:53.710
- Really?
- I'll bet she made that up.

13:53.794 --> 13:56.919
Oh-- OK. It's showtime
at the baby Apollo. Let's go.

13:57.001 --> 13:59.585
Richard, is chocolate
bad for dogs?

13:59.669 --> 14:01.752
- Oh, no, not bad. Deadly.
- OK. What?

14:01.835 --> 14:04.418
- Hello, Lurlene.

14:04.502 --> 14:06.752
Richard,
you can't keep working
on both campaigns.

14:06.835 --> 14:09.210
But they're both
equally good people.

14:09.293 --> 14:11.669
- Isn't there somewhere
they can both be president?
- Fortunately, no.

14:11.752 --> 14:13.835
No! Little Richard,
don't pull Mommy's hair.

14:13.919 --> 14:15.293
"That's not our plan," Mother.

14:15.377 --> 14:17.710
All right, fine.
Here. Take it.

14:17.794 --> 14:19.919
Reporter:
Madam President, will you be
announcing your candidacy today?

14:20.001 --> 14:22.168
No. I mean,
that's not our plan.

14:22.251 --> 14:24.001
What?! You're not
planning on running?

14:26.502 --> 14:28.669
I've always been a big fan
of Selina Meyer's,

14:28.752 --> 14:30.794
but it's time
for some new blood.

14:30.877 --> 14:32.585
Is this what I came to Iowa for?

14:32.669 --> 14:34.543
- It's everywhere, ma'am.
- Well, except Buzzfeed.

14:34.627 --> 14:36.919
They led with the story
about the dog mayor in a coma.

14:37.001 --> 14:39.001
- Oh, my gosh.
- Ma'am, please
don't make Catherine

14:39.085 --> 14:41.502
feel any worse
than she already does.
She's suffering from--

14:41.585 --> 14:44.877
- I know. Postpartum depression.
- Catherine has
postpartum depression?

14:44.960 --> 14:47.418
- I didn't notice anything.
- I thought she was
in a good  mood.

14:47.502 --> 14:49.752
Ma'am, we have
to announce immediately
to counter this.

14:49.835 --> 14:51.543
Why not announce
at the Statue of Liberty?

14:51.627 --> 14:53.251
- You love standing
next to ugly women.
- Yes!

14:53.335 --> 14:56.543
OK, call Senator Talbot,
see if she can introduce me.

14:56.627 --> 14:58.168
'Cause we could use the color,
don't ya think?

14:58.251 --> 14:59.794
Could I get a quote
for my article?

14:59.877 --> 15:01.835
Goddamnit,
what is Mike doing in here?!

15:01.919 --> 15:05.168
And why does he have
a good idea now that
he's not working for us?

15:05.251 --> 15:07.418
- Does anybody have time to sit
for an interview real quick?
- Mike. Mike.

15:07.502 --> 15:09.293
- A blurbicle?
- No. Get out of here.

15:09.377 --> 15:12.210
I'll go announce
at a white supremacist compound
if I have to.

15:12.293 --> 15:14.043
There gotta be
tons of them
around here.

15:14.126 --> 15:16.543
Ma'am, you're thinking of Idaho.
Iowa is mostly meth labs.

15:16.627 --> 15:18.585
That's mainly just
a difference in branding.

15:18.669 --> 15:22.085
- Amy: There's our new leader.
- Ben: Keith Quinn in da house!

15:22.168 --> 15:23.377
Selina:
OK, well,

15:23.460 --> 15:25.293
screw your wigs on tight,
Team Dipshit,

15:25.377 --> 15:30.001
you're about to see
how a campaign is really ru--

15:30.085 --> 15:32.126
- No, that's not him.
- Amy: What do you mean?

15:32.210 --> 15:33.835
- I mean that's not him.
- It's not him.

15:33.919 --> 15:36.502
- That's Keith Quinn.
- No, that is not Keith Quinn.

15:36.585 --> 15:37.919
- Not him.
- Ma'am, it is  him.

15:38.001 --> 15:39.877
I thought Keith Quinn
was someone else!

15:39.960 --> 15:42.168
- Someone else.
- It is not my  job

15:42.251 --> 15:45.543
to know what Keith Quinn
does or does not look like!

15:45.627 --> 15:47.460
- Amy--
- Ma'am, look who's here.

15:47.543 --> 15:48.752
- Keith!
- Yes!

15:48.835 --> 15:50.960
- Keith Quinn!
- That's me!

15:51.043 --> 15:53.877
Oh! And I'm so...
just amazed to see you.

15:53.960 --> 15:55.418
I was shocked
to get the call
to come here.

15:55.502 --> 15:57.418
- I bet.
- But so happy.

15:57.502 --> 15:59.752
I want Kent to show you
where your office is.

15:59.835 --> 16:02.585
- Oh, sure.
- Right next to mine.
I hope that's OK with you.

16:02.669 --> 16:04.919
Where else would it be?
I'm the campaign manager,
right?

16:05.001 --> 16:06.794
- Yeah.

16:06.877 --> 16:09.293
And I want you to whip
everybody into shape.

16:09.377 --> 16:10.752
Oh!

16:10.835 --> 16:12.919
- OK-- Good.
- Keith: Brought all my whips!

16:13.001 --> 16:15.418
But let me just say
thank you so much.

16:15.502 --> 16:18.377
- Selina: Oh...
- This is a really big
step up for me.

16:18.460 --> 16:19.960
Oh. Ohh...

16:20.043 --> 16:21.960
- Right this way, Mr. Quinn.
- Welcome, welcome, welcome!

16:22.043 --> 16:24.293
Thank you! Fire him.

16:24.377 --> 16:26.460
He's deader than democracy,
ma'am.

16:26.543 --> 16:28.669
Wait a minute. No!
The press cannot know

16:28.752 --> 16:30.251
that we've made
another mistake.

16:30.335 --> 16:32.335
I-I'm so sorry.
What's happening?

16:32.418 --> 16:33.960
Amy hired the wrong guy.

16:34.043 --> 16:35.710
So who's running the campaign?

16:35.794 --> 16:37.335
- Keith Quinn, obviously, Amy.
- OK.

16:37.418 --> 16:40.335
But he cannot know that
I've never seen him before

16:40.418 --> 16:41.877
in my entire life!

16:41.960 --> 16:43.502
So everyone's
gonna report to Ben,

16:43.585 --> 16:45.627
he's gonna be the secret
campaign manager.

16:45.710 --> 16:47.710
Congratulations, Mr. Cafferty.

16:47.794 --> 16:49.585
My thoughts and prayers go out

16:49.669 --> 16:51.210
to the good people
of Spokane.

16:51.293 --> 16:52.835
What happened today
was a tragedy.

16:52.919 --> 16:54.377
But here is the hard truth:

16:54.460 --> 16:56.919
Sometimes hotshot
lacrosse players

16:57.001 --> 17:00.085
who think they own the cafeteria
can bring this on themselves.

17:00.168 --> 17:04.085
- Congressman, will your wife
be joining you today?
- Uh, no, not today. Just me.

17:04.167 --> 17:06.377
Will she be joining you
at the senior center
this afternoon?

17:06.460 --> 17:10.001
No, so stop asking
questions about my wife.
It's not like I murdered her.

17:10.085 --> 17:11.710
- Is your wife OK?
- Look, I challenge you.

17:11.794 --> 17:14.167
Go ahead. Try to find one thing
that's wrong with my marriage.

17:14.251 --> 17:16.627
Send out your top guys,
have 'em follow me around.

17:16.710 --> 17:19.001
- Did you marry your stepsister?
- Goddamn it. Who told you?

17:19.085 --> 17:21.627
Is Beth Hennick's father
your stepfather, Lloyd Hennick?

17:21.710 --> 17:24.210
- I married my half-sister.
- Teddy: No, stepsister!

17:24.292 --> 17:26.042
Whichever one,
when I bone her

17:26.126 --> 17:28.335
she doesn't give birth to
a pile of legs or whatever.

17:28.417 --> 17:30.335
You know what?
If you wanna attack somebody,

17:30.418 --> 17:31.669
attack my cousin Ezra.

17:31.752 --> 17:34.210
He's the one who
fingered her in high school.

17:34.293 --> 17:36.043
We wanna thank
the firefighters,
the real heroes!

17:36.126 --> 17:37.919
Sophie:
Amy, I put off
getting an abortion once,

17:38.001 --> 17:39.669
and now I've got Joaquin.

17:39.752 --> 17:40.960
I thought if I just
talked to Dan, then--

17:41.043 --> 17:42.335
- Shh.

17:42.418 --> 17:45.669
Fuck my parents!
I thought Kent snapped.

17:45.752 --> 17:47.377
- Not today.
- Staff meeting.

17:47.460 --> 17:48.794
Why can't we do it
in the conference room?

17:48.877 --> 17:50.710
Because, Amy,
your hire, Keith Quinn,

17:50.794 --> 17:53.710
is in the conference room
having what he thinks
is a staff meeting,

17:53.794 --> 17:55.877
but we're actually having
the real staff meeting in here.

17:55.960 --> 17:57.543
- Meyer for President.
- Oh, boy.

17:57.627 --> 17:59.418
I really thought my fifties
would be about me

17:59.502 --> 18:01.585
fuckin' and suckin' my way
through The Shorenstein Center.

18:01.669 --> 18:03.543
- You and me both, ma'am.
- Ma'am, we need to pick

18:03.627 --> 18:05.043
a location
for your announcement.

18:05.126 --> 18:07.085
Can you text Gary, please?

18:07.168 --> 18:09.251
- He's been gone for an hour.
I need that smoothie.
- Yeah.

18:09.335 --> 18:10.669
- Ma'am, I've got it.
- OK.

18:10.752 --> 18:12.502
We do your announcement
where you historically

18:12.585 --> 18:15.585
announced your first run
for the presidency
nine years ago.

18:15.669 --> 18:16.794
Um...

18:16.877 --> 18:18.418
Susan B. Anthony's birthplace?

18:18.502 --> 18:19.794
- Oh.
- I love it.

18:19.877 --> 18:21.752
- What is in this?
- Bourbon and Smartwater.

18:21.835 --> 18:23.126
Woman, hero, suffragette,

18:23.210 --> 18:25.168
bringing the Selina Meyer
story full circle.

18:25.251 --> 18:27.627
- Marjorie: Yes.
- You know what?
I kinda love it.

18:27.710 --> 18:29.710
- OK, we'll figure it out
in the air.
- Yeah, yes.

18:29.794 --> 18:31.043
- And not a word of this leaks.
- No.

18:31.126 --> 18:32.835
- Did you text Gary?
- I did.

18:32.919 --> 18:35.377
There was a shooting
at a Home Depot and they
closed the interstate.

18:35.460 --> 18:37.085
Oh, Jesus,
Mary and Jamba Juice!

18:37.168 --> 18:38.585
I really wanted that smoothie.

18:38.669 --> 18:40.377
- I know you did.
- Hey! Where's everybody goin'?

18:40.460 --> 18:42.960
She loves what you're doing.
Just keep on crackin'.

18:44.168 --> 18:45.752
OK.

18:45.835 --> 18:47.960
Oh, hey, I'm still waitin'
on that Wi-Fi password.

18:48.043 --> 18:50.251
- I haven't eaten all day.

18:50.335 --> 18:51.835
Mike:
Ma'am, any comment
on the latest shooting?

18:51.919 --> 18:53.460
Selina:
It's an absolute outrage.

18:53.543 --> 18:55.418
I mean frankly,
somebody needs to do

18:55.502 --> 18:56.794
something about these shootings

18:56.877 --> 18:59.627
because I cannot
take any more of this.

18:59.710 --> 19:01.669
Powerful words.

19:06.418 --> 19:09.627
Check this out.
Connecting rooms.

19:09.710 --> 19:10.794
( exhales)

19:10.877 --> 19:12.210
They got me bunkin' with Gary.

19:12.293 --> 19:13.794
You should see all
of Selina's dresses in here.

19:13.877 --> 19:15.377
At least I hope
they're hers.

19:15.460 --> 19:16.835
I'm thinking
of having this baby,

19:16.919 --> 19:18.794
and I'm not asking
anything of you,

19:18.877 --> 19:20.335
literally nothing,
but I do want the baby

19:20.418 --> 19:21.502
to know that you're the father.

19:21.585 --> 19:23.126
But I don't want your last name

19:23.210 --> 19:24.960
because I've always
loved the name Meagan

19:25.043 --> 19:26.251
and I don't want
people to think

19:26.335 --> 19:27.919
that I was going
for Mee-gan Ee-gan

19:28.001 --> 19:29.502
because that sounds like someone
who gets ass-fucked

19:29.585 --> 19:31.585
on the Major Deegan
in a limerick.

19:34.251 --> 19:36.168
Whoa.

19:36.251 --> 19:38.085
I-I like the name Meagan, too.

19:39.710 --> 19:42.502
Although the Deegan's
always congested. So...

19:42.585 --> 19:45.669
Yeah, the Cross Bronx
is much better for butt stuff.

19:45.752 --> 19:47.001
(chuckles)

19:47.085 --> 19:49.085
OK, well, just sleep on it,
or whatever.

19:49.168 --> 19:51.043
- OK, good night, Dan.
- Night, Amy--

19:52.585 --> 19:54.001
- Ugh.
- Oh!

19:54.085 --> 19:55.293
Why do I have to tell people

19:55.377 --> 19:56.710
why I want to be president?

19:56.794 --> 19:58.877
I don't want to hear
about their  jobs.

19:58.960 --> 20:01.543
These are toxic.
I'm gonna throw them out.

20:01.627 --> 20:03.585
Oh, oh, oh.
I've been wanting to ask you,

20:03.669 --> 20:07.001
have you seen how Amy
is hovering over Dan?
I think they're hookin' up.

20:07.085 --> 20:10.085
- Dan is not dippin' his pen
in that ink stain.
- No?

20:10.168 --> 20:14.251
Plus she's getting kinda fat
in the front. Did you see that?

20:14.335 --> 20:16.669
It is literally
all I can think about.

20:17.794 --> 20:20.210
- Ugh. Hey, Gary.
- Mm-hmm.

20:20.293 --> 20:22.293
Why would you  want
to be president?

20:22.377 --> 20:24.335
To give it to you,
of course.

20:24.418 --> 20:26.585
Oh. That's good. God.

20:26.669 --> 20:30.377
I know what I want to say,
but I can't find the words.

20:30.460 --> 20:32.627
What if you talk and I type?
How about that?

20:32.710 --> 20:34.543
- You just say it out loud,
and then I'll just type it.
- Yes. OK.

20:34.627 --> 20:37.043
- How about that? Great, great.
- Yeah. Let's try that. OK.

20:37.126 --> 20:40.043
- This is fun.
- Well, from the time
I was a girl...

20:40.126 --> 20:42.502
"From the time
I was a pretty girl..."

20:42.585 --> 20:43.752
- No, not pretty girl.
- No.

20:43.835 --> 20:45.251
"From the time I was a girl."

20:45.335 --> 20:46.627
Oh, but you were
so pretty.

20:46.710 --> 20:48.460
I know.

20:48.543 --> 20:50.877
But anyway,
I have fought...

20:50.960 --> 20:52.960
- Good. Good.
- ...every day...

20:53.043 --> 20:54.919
- So good.
- ...to make America a--

20:55.001 --> 20:57.794
- A very good place.
- No, don't finish my sentences.

20:57.877 --> 20:59.585
- I thought that's
where you were going.
- You don't know

20:59.669 --> 21:01.251
- where I'm going.
- To the White House!

21:01.335 --> 21:02.919
You know what I would like
to tell people,

21:03.001 --> 21:05.418
- but obviously I can't?
- Say it here.

21:05.502 --> 21:07.085
- I should be president...
- Yeah?

21:07.168 --> 21:10.752
because it is my goddamn turn!

21:10.835 --> 21:13.001
- I  was the game-changer...
- Yep.

21:13.085 --> 21:15.210
I  took a dump
on the glass ceiling,

21:15.293 --> 21:18.627
and  I shaved my muff
in the sink of
the old boys' club.

21:18.710 --> 21:20.585
- Muff.
- But for three years

21:20.669 --> 21:25.168
Hughes kept me
chained to a radiator
in some basement in Cleveland.

21:25.251 --> 21:29.126
So as far as I'm concerned,
America owes  me

21:29.210 --> 21:32.043
an eight-year stay
in the White House,

21:32.126 --> 21:35.126
and this time,
I want a war!

21:35.210 --> 21:37.502
- Ye-es!

21:37.585 --> 21:39.960
All right.
Do you want me
to read that back?

21:40.043 --> 21:41.377
Oh, we can't use
any of that.

21:41.460 --> 21:43.460
- Oh.
- It sounds like I'm shouting

21:43.543 --> 21:44.752
from a balcony in Munich.

21:44.835 --> 21:46.126
( gasps ) Like Evita!

21:46.210 --> 21:48.460
OK, just put down something
about how I want to give

21:48.543 --> 21:50.168
the American people
a better deal

21:50.251 --> 21:51.627
or some fuckin' crap like that.

21:51.710 --> 21:53.085
Very Kennedy-esque.

21:53.168 --> 21:55.210
John, not Teddy.

21:56.377 --> 21:57.919
Or the rapey one.

21:58.001 --> 22:00.460
Or the one that killed
that little girl.

22:02.627 --> 22:03.627
Dan: Amy?

22:03.710 --> 22:05.794
Hey, can I come in?

22:05.877 --> 22:08.543
- I need to talk to you.
- Come in.

22:08.627 --> 22:11.627
Hey. Um,
just a quick heads-up,

22:11.710 --> 22:12.960
you might want to keep
this door closed.

22:13.043 --> 22:14.043
I'm gonna fuck Mike's boss.

22:14.126 --> 22:15.752
My spidey sense tells me

22:15.835 --> 22:19.168
she's gonna yelp like a seagull
in a bread factory. So...

22:19.251 --> 22:20.835
Yeah.

22:20.919 --> 22:23.418
S-Stick it in there good, pal.

22:23.502 --> 22:25.335
Only way I know how.

22:31.377 --> 22:33.627
That lobby bar better be open!

22:35.126 --> 22:37.877
I'm gonna have it
all by my fucking self!

22:39.335 --> 22:40.460
What is she
talking about?

22:40.543 --> 22:42.835
Probably a cheesecake
or something.

22:44.210 --> 22:45.919
You said it, not me.

22:46.001 --> 22:48.001
All right, nighty-night.

22:49.919 --> 22:51.543
Oh, shoot.

22:51.627 --> 22:53.085
( knocking ) Hey, Dan.

22:53.168 --> 22:54.752
It's your roomie, Gary.

22:54.835 --> 22:56.710
Uh, I forgot my key.

22:59.460 --> 23:00.960
Hey, Dan?

23:03.627 --> 23:05.669
My heart medicine's in there.

23:12.293 --> 23:13.752
Oh! Good, there you are.

23:13.835 --> 23:17.710
I need coffee and any kind
of egg white frittata.

23:17.794 --> 23:19.752
Put your jacket on.
This isn't a homeless shelter.

23:19.835 --> 23:21.293
Yeah, yeah.

23:22.627 --> 23:23.669
Hmm.

23:27.835 --> 23:29.543
Oh, Ames. Ames. Hey.

23:29.627 --> 23:31.543
Uh... listen,

23:31.627 --> 23:33.502
I just don't know if I'm ready
to be a daddy

23:33.585 --> 23:35.669
to anyone who's not
a sexy boho jewelry maker

23:35.752 --> 23:37.835
struggling to pay off
her college loans.

23:37.919 --> 23:39.585
I appreciate
the soul-searching.

23:39.669 --> 23:41.460
But if you wanna go Dutch
or whatever on the abortion,

23:41.543 --> 23:43.251
just hit me up on Venmo, OK?

23:43.335 --> 23:46.460
Oh, you know what?
Make it public, OK?
Shows I'm a gentleman.

23:49.377 --> 23:51.085
Oh, thanks, guys!

23:51.168 --> 23:52.627
Woman:
We love you, Selina!

23:52.710 --> 23:54.085
Wow.

23:54.168 --> 23:56.335
This place has
feminine symbolism

23:56.418 --> 23:57.752
spurtin' out of its dickhole.

23:57.835 --> 24:00.251
All right, boys,
let's go launch this rocket.

24:00.335 --> 24:02.460
Let's just hope
it's the Columbia
and not the Challenger.

24:02.543 --> 24:04.502
Both exploded,
killing all aboard.

24:04.585 --> 24:06.418
OK, whatever. The one
without the schoolteacher.

24:06.502 --> 24:10.251
What is... going on here?
Where is the stage?

24:10.335 --> 24:14.251
- This was all supposed to be
done like six hours ago.
- The tents aren't even here.

24:14.335 --> 24:16.210
I'm guessin'
those were supposed to be
put up four or five hours ago.

24:16.293 --> 24:17.627
You want the stages up first.

24:17.710 --> 24:19.168
Ma'am, it--

24:19.251 --> 24:21.085
- it turns out
back in 2008...
- Yeah?

24:21.168 --> 24:24.794
your campaign
did not pay the bill
for your announcement.

24:24.877 --> 24:27.210
- I-I--
- I want you
to meet Nick Spooner,

24:27.293 --> 24:29.085
he owns the tent company.

24:29.168 --> 24:31.627
- Hello, Mr. Spooner.
- Spooner.

24:31.710 --> 24:34.585
If you could just set up...
the stage, it--

24:34.669 --> 24:37.752
Your Honor,
I totally respect
your office

24:37.835 --> 24:39.627
- and your service
to this country...
- Thank you.

24:39.710 --> 24:41.877
as former Commander-in-Chief
of the armed services.

24:41.960 --> 24:43.418
Well, it's my pleasure.
Thank you.

24:43.502 --> 24:45.335
And I want to say
that I love America.

24:45.418 --> 24:47.418
- Mm-hm.
- However...

24:47.502 --> 24:49.251
I am sick and tired

24:49.335 --> 24:50.960
of these
hoity-toity people--

24:51.043 --> 24:52.627
- like yourself--
- O...K.

24:52.710 --> 24:56.460
prancing in here with
this la-dee-da attitude

24:56.543 --> 24:59.752
and total "disregahd"
for the working class people

24:59.835 --> 25:01.293
of this country,
like myself.

25:01.377 --> 25:03.126
Truth to power. Good for you.

25:03.210 --> 25:05.168
My aide Mr. Walsh

25:05.251 --> 25:06.919
would like
to speak with you...

25:07.001 --> 25:09.543
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Your aide?

25:09.627 --> 25:11.251
Your hat is so  fun.

25:11.335 --> 25:13.377
The "B." Have you been
to Barbuda?

25:13.460 --> 25:16.168
Can we just pay this townie
and get on with it, please?

25:16.251 --> 25:18.460
It's too late now.
The press is already arriving.

25:18.543 --> 25:22.001
So the national press
is now arriving

25:22.085 --> 25:25.960
to this giant metaphor
for a...

25:26.043 --> 25:28.377
clusterfuck  of a campaign.

25:28.460 --> 25:30.293
Actually, it's a synecdoche.

25:30.377 --> 25:32.210
Technically, it's more of
a goat rape than a clusterfuck.

25:32.293 --> 25:36.794
If I ever needed a miracle
it is right now.

25:36.877 --> 25:39.960
Ma'am, there's been
a mass shooting
in a mall in Phoenix.

25:40.043 --> 25:41.460
Twenty-seven people
have been killed.

25:41.543 --> 25:43.126
- Oh, my God.
- Oh.

25:47.377 --> 25:50.210
Hohhh.

25:50.293 --> 25:53.043
This can... work for us?

25:53.126 --> 25:55.377
Yes, because we couldn't
possibly announce now

25:55.460 --> 25:57.126
out of respect
for the victims.

25:58.126 --> 26:00.335
Halle-fuckin'-lujah!

26:00.418 --> 26:02.377
Praise the rational
equivalent of Jesus,

26:02.460 --> 26:05.335
what Bonhoeffer would call
the spirit of beloved community.

26:05.418 --> 26:08.293
We have to send that shooter
a nice thank-you card.

26:08.377 --> 26:10.418
Actually, he shot himself
before he could be apprehended.

26:10.502 --> 26:11.835
I'll send something
to his wife.

26:11.919 --> 26:13.043
Oh. Actually,
he shot her first.

26:13.126 --> 26:15.335
I am literally shaking
from this.

26:15.418 --> 26:16.585
Selina:
I can't believe it!

26:16.669 --> 26:18.960
- Hey, guys!

26:19.043 --> 26:20.710
Teddy:
This is our chance

26:20.794 --> 26:22.210
to get in front
of the marriage story,

26:22.293 --> 26:23.627
- shape the narrative.
- Mm-hmm.

26:23.710 --> 26:24.919
All right.

26:25.001 --> 26:27.168
Whoa.
What was that?

26:27.251 --> 26:29.502
I'm just adjusting your mic.

26:29.585 --> 26:32.001
I was chemically castrated,
remember?

26:36.168 --> 26:37.710
As adults, you met again

26:37.794 --> 26:39.752
- at Nancy's father's funeral?
- Beth: Right.

26:39.835 --> 26:41.085
He was just so tall

26:41.168 --> 26:43.460
that I fell in love
with him that night.

26:43.543 --> 26:46.835
And, um, two months later
we were married.

26:46.919 --> 26:49.251
In a normal... marriage.

26:49.335 --> 26:51.251
Not weird or disgusting at all.

26:51.335 --> 26:54.460
- Normal.
- So what would you say
to someone who might ask,

26:54.543 --> 26:58.085
"How can they marry?
They're step-siblings."

26:58.168 --> 27:00.126
I'm not her brother,
and I never was.

27:00.210 --> 27:01.710
Except for that one year.

27:01.794 --> 27:03.335
It's exactly what
Woody Allen did.

27:03.418 --> 27:05.710
I'm clearly no more
of a pervert than he is,

27:05.794 --> 27:07.418
and if you're
gonna criticize us,

27:07.502 --> 27:10.585
then you better be prepared
to criticize Woody Allen

27:10.669 --> 27:11.960
and the little Chinese girl.

27:12.043 --> 27:13.168
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

27:13.251 --> 27:14.335
Selina:
I would like to offer

27:14.418 --> 27:15.585
my thoughts and prayers

27:15.669 --> 27:17.418
for the victims
and their families.

27:17.502 --> 27:19.335
And I realize that
there are those who say

27:19.418 --> 27:22.126
that thoughts and prayers
aren't enough,

27:22.210 --> 27:24.377
but prayer works, believe me.

27:24.460 --> 27:25.669
It worked for me today.

27:25.752 --> 27:27.710
- Ben: Amen.
- Man: Whoo!

27:30.168 --> 27:31.794
And...

27:31.877 --> 27:35.585
and this may not seem
like the right time,

27:35.669 --> 27:39.085
but I have to say
that I love this country.

27:39.168 --> 27:41.126
- I think we all do.

27:41.210 --> 27:46.335
And I am sick and tired
of all these hoity-toity people

27:46.418 --> 27:49.377
prancing around with
their la-dee-da attitudes

27:49.460 --> 27:52.377
with complete "disregahd"--

27:52.460 --> 27:55.168
re--regard for the rights

27:55.251 --> 27:57.126
of normal, working class

27:57.210 --> 27:59.835
- men and women!

27:59.919 --> 28:02.960
And that is why
I wanna be President

28:03.043 --> 28:04.585
of the United States of America!

28:04.669 --> 28:08.335
- And my candidacy begins...

28:08.418 --> 28:10.377
right now! Thank you!

28:10.460 --> 28:12.627
- Did you write that?
- Yes.

28:12.710 --> 28:15.502
This is the bill
for Mr. Spooner,
the old work plus today.

28:15.585 --> 28:17.251
Yeah. I'm not paying that.

28:19.293 --> 28:22.418
So, at the center of all
of this emotional turmoil

28:22.502 --> 28:26.126
is Beth's father
and Jonah's stepfather,

28:26.210 --> 28:27.919
- Lloyd Hennick.
- He was a monster.

28:28.001 --> 28:29.835
Mr. Hennick, would you
join us, please?

28:29.919 --> 28:31.335
- Hi.
- Wh-What?

28:31.418 --> 28:33.377
- Have a seat.
- What is he doing here?

28:33.460 --> 28:35.001
- Jonas:
Did you know about this?
- Beth: No.

28:35.085 --> 28:37.126
- Hi, Jonah.
- ( mocking ) "Oh, hi, Jonah."

28:37.210 --> 28:38.710
Interviewer:
Lloyd, is there anything

28:38.794 --> 28:41.210
you would like
to say to your son--

28:41.293 --> 28:43.627
your stepson,  Jonah?

28:43.710 --> 28:46.377
Yes. Jonah, I have always
tried to be there for you.

28:46.460 --> 28:47.877
That's why I bought
your first car

28:47.960 --> 28:49.835
and paid for all six years
of college, champ!

28:49.919 --> 28:52.168
How come you failed me
in algebra, Mr. Hennick?

28:52.251 --> 28:53.543
You failed eighth grade math?

28:53.627 --> 28:55.168
My mom never loved you.

28:55.251 --> 28:56.502
You know that?
She told me that.

28:56.585 --> 28:58.043
Thanksgiving 1996.

28:58.126 --> 28:59.960
We'd love to have him back,
you know, by himself.

29:00.043 --> 29:01.877
- It'd be great.
- Eat a dick.

29:01.960 --> 29:03.710
Nancy, ever since the kids
have gotten together,

29:03.794 --> 29:06.919
it's just reminded me
of how much I miss you.

29:07.001 --> 29:09.251
- Jonah: No! No, no, no!
- Oh, I'm--

29:09.335 --> 29:10.960
Do not touch her! No!

29:11.043 --> 29:13.418
Those hands are for making me
Hot Pockets and nothing else.

29:13.502 --> 29:15.627
You are gonna die alone.
Get up. Move over.

29:15.710 --> 29:17.585
- Beth: Do you want me to move?
- Yes, you guys switch.

29:17.669 --> 29:19.210
How does this
make you feel,
Nancy,

29:19.293 --> 29:21.543
- with th--
- It makes me feel terrible.

29:21.627 --> 29:22.794
I miss him!

29:22.877 --> 29:25.251
- I miss you! I miss you!
- No, no, no!

29:25.335 --> 29:28.585
- Jonah: I'm gonna be president!
I'm gonna be president!

29:28.669 --> 29:31.251
- I'm gonna be president!
- What?! Wha--

29:31.335 --> 29:33.293
Actually, since this segment
first aired,

29:33.377 --> 29:35.377
Jonah's numbers
are up over 3%.

29:35.460 --> 29:36.585
He's tapped into something.

29:36.669 --> 29:37.919
Yeah, his stepsister.

29:38.001 --> 29:39.168
Well, it's playing big with

29:39.251 --> 29:40.710
non-college educated
white males,

29:40.794 --> 29:43.085
and.... college educated
white males.

29:43.168 --> 29:45.085
Basically, white males.

29:45.168 --> 29:46.627
This entire country

29:46.710 --> 29:49.752
is getting more disgusting
by the second.

29:49.835 --> 29:51.627
That's a demo
we're targeting
mostly on Facebook.

29:51.710 --> 29:54.669
OK, can we just talk about
how I pulled

29:54.752 --> 29:57.835
one of the all-time
campaign announcements

29:57.919 --> 30:01.168
- out of my lily-white anus?
- Kudos on that, Gary.

30:01.251 --> 30:02.960
- Selina: What?
- The field could not
be any clearer.

30:03.043 --> 30:04.669
Ma'am, you need
to see this.

30:04.752 --> 30:06.919
I believe that our country
will always be

30:07.001 --> 30:08.502
a shining beacon of hope...

30:08.585 --> 30:10.126
- Oh, God, he looks good.
- for our own people

30:10.210 --> 30:12.335
and those who will learn
from our example.

30:12.418 --> 30:15.627
And that is why
I would like to announce
my candidacy for the office

30:15.710 --> 30:18.085
- That! Right there!
- of President of the United
States of America.

30:18.168 --> 30:20.960
That's the Keith Quinn
I was talking about.

30:21.043 --> 30:22.877
Move!
