WEBVTT

00:20.521 --> 00:24.225
(horns honks in distance,
bird wings flap)

00:26.157 --> 00:27.698
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE.
(gasps) IT'S OKAY.

00:27.698 --> 00:30.161
WELL...

00:30.161 --> 00:31.662
DO YOU WANT
SOME BREAKFAST?

00:31.662 --> 00:33.134
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

00:33.134 --> 00:35.806
I'M SORRY. I-I KNOW I'M NOT
SUPPOSED TO SLEEP OVER.

00:35.806 --> 00:37.238
I WAS JUST SO TIRED.

00:37.238 --> 00:39.140
I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA CLOSE
MY EYES FOR A SECOND.

00:39.140 --> 00:41.041
IT'S OKAY.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.474
IT'S NOT.
I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU.

00:43.474 --> 00:47.578
THIS IS CASUAL. IT'S NOT ABOUT
SNUGGLING IN THE MORNING.

00:47.578 --> 00:51.582
IT'S EASY. THAT'S ME.
EASY PEASY LEMON SQUEEZY.

00:51.582 --> 00:54.085
(cell phone vibrates)

00:54.085 --> 00:56.787
LEAH, I WAS GONNA ORDER
SOME FOOD,

00:56.787 --> 00:58.429
SO IF YOU WANT SOME--

00:58.429 --> 01:00.661
I'M FINE.
I GOTTA GO FIND A COSTUME

01:00.661 --> 01:02.533
FOR THIS THING
AT JOE'S TONIGHT, SO...

01:02.533 --> 01:03.564
(gasps)

01:03.564 --> 01:05.296
THAT'S RIGHT. IT'S HALLOWEEN.

01:05.296 --> 01:06.597
(door opens)

01:06.597 --> 01:07.738
HAPPY--

01:09.170 --> 01:11.742
(Meredith) EVERY HALLOWEEN
WE MAKE A CHOICE

01:11.742 --> 01:14.545
ABOUT WHAT KIND OF COSTUME
WE'RE GOING TO WEAR--

01:14.545 --> 01:16.507
SOMETHING SEXY...

01:16.507 --> 01:18.379
MORNING.
OH, GOOD.
CAN YOU TAKE THESE?

01:18.379 --> 01:19.580
THERE'S A RIP
IN THE BOTTOM LEFT.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.212
OH.
I JUST FINISHED AN APPY,

01:21.212 --> 01:22.613
AND I WAS GOING TO DO IT
IN THE 20 MINUTES

01:22.613 --> 01:24.485
BEFORE MY LAP CHOLE.
MM-HMM.

01:24.485 --> 01:27.087
BUT I NEED TO GET ON THE PHONE
AND ORDER A 3-D PRINTER.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.619
YOUR GRANT GOT APPROVED?
THAT'S GREAT.

01:28.619 --> 01:29.860
YEAH, IT IS,
EXCEPT IT'S A CONFLICT

01:29.860 --> 01:31.362
WITH A BUTTERFLY WING
REPAIR.

01:31.362 --> 01:34.094
WELL, I NEED TO SOLVE
MY ARRAY PROBLEM TODAY.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.626
IF I CAN FIGURE OUT HOW
TO SHRINK THE CRANIOTOMY,

01:35.626 --> 01:37.168
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO AVOID
A LOT OF THE INFECTIONS

01:37.168 --> 01:38.369
THAT WE'RE GETTING.

01:38.369 --> 01:39.530
OKAY, WELL, THIS WILL ONLY
TAKE YOU FOUR MINUTES.

01:39.530 --> 01:40.771
I KNOW. I'M JUST
TELLING YOU ABOUT MY DAY.

01:40.771 --> 01:42.233
OH, WELL, I DID NOT FACTOR THAT
INTO THE SCHEDULE.

01:42.233 --> 01:43.674
AND TRICK-OR-TREATING
STILL ON TONIGHT?

01:43.674 --> 01:46.106
UH, OF COURSE, OF COURSE.
MAYBE WE'LL BE SOMEONE SCARY...

01:46.106 --> 01:47.508
ALEX.

01:47.508 --> 01:48.879
DID YOU GET THE HOUSE READY?
YEP.

01:48.879 --> 01:50.741
OKAY. CANDY?
NO.

01:50.741 --> 01:52.683
DID YOU GET THE PUMPKINS?
NO.

01:52.683 --> 01:54.745
DID YOU PUT UP
THE SPIDER WEBS?
NO.

01:54.745 --> 01:57.818
THEN HOW IS THE HOUSE READY?
I GOT THE KEG.

01:57.818 --> 01:59.490
OH, YOU'RE HAVING A PARTY
AT THE HOUSE?

01:59.490 --> 02:02.153
UM, YEAH, ALEX IS LETTING US
USE THE HOUSE

02:02.153 --> 02:03.224
TO TRICK-OR-TREAT FROM

02:03.224 --> 02:04.895
BECAUSE WE HAVE NO NEIGHBORS
WHERE WE ARE,

02:04.895 --> 02:07.898
SO I INVITED A BUNCH
OF FAMILIES FROM THE DAY CARE.

02:07.898 --> 02:09.630
HE DIDN'T TELL YOU?
NO.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.162
OH. YOU SHOULD COME.

02:11.162 --> 02:12.903
IT'S FINE.

02:12.903 --> 02:15.135
RIGHT. WELL, YOU DON'T WANNA BE
AROUND A BUNCH OF KIDS

02:15.135 --> 02:17.238
HOPPED UP ON SUGAR ANYWAY,
RIGHT?
RIGHT.

02:17.238 --> 02:19.139
'CAUSE I HATE CHILDREN.
CRISTINA--

02:19.139 --> 02:21.272
BUT I LOVE YOUR KIDS.

02:21.272 --> 02:24.545
I SHOULD HAVE INVITED YOU.
I'M SORRY. I JUST THOUGHT--

02:24.545 --> 02:26.647
BUT YOU SHOULD COME
FOR A DRINK.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.450
IT'S AT 7:00.
SHE'S GONNA BE A BUTTERFLY.

02:29.450 --> 02:32.583
I HAVE TO GO.
I HAVE A LAP CHOLE.

02:32.583 --> 02:35.386
OR YOU COULD BE A SUPERHERO,

02:35.386 --> 02:37.788
WHICH IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO BE
THIS YEAR.

02:37.788 --> 02:39.590
(indistinct conversations)

02:39.590 --> 02:40.731
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

02:40.731 --> 02:42.233
HOW MANY FINGERS?

02:42.233 --> 02:44.495
THREE. HANGNAIL
ON THE INDEX FINGER.

02:44.495 --> 02:46.737
NO SIDE EFFECTS?
MY UNCLE HAD LASIK,

02:46.737 --> 02:49.600
LIKE, THREE YEARS AGO. HE STILL
HAS HORRIBLE FACIAL PAIN

02:49.600 --> 02:52.303
AND HE'S BASICALLY ADDICTED
TO PAINKILLERS.
LEAH.

02:52.303 --> 02:53.804
WELL, YOUR UNCLE PROBABLY CAME
BACK TO WORK TOO EARLY

02:53.804 --> 02:56.347
AND DIDN'T TAKE THE TWO DAYS OFF
THAT THE DOCTOR RECOMMENDED.

02:56.347 --> 02:59.480
I AM A SECOND-YEAR RESIDENT.
16 HOURS IS ALREADY

02:59.480 --> 03:01.382
MORE RECOVERY TIME
THAN I CAN AFFORD.
(sighs)

03:01.382 --> 03:03.183
GO WORK. LEAVE ME ALONE.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.285
ALL RIGHT.

03:04.285 --> 03:05.456
(kisses)

03:06.517 --> 03:09.720
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

03:09.720 --> 03:11.622
HOW'S IT GOING
WITH ALEX?

03:11.622 --> 03:12.863
RADIO SILENCE.

03:12.863 --> 03:14.825
STILL?
I THINK IT'S OVER.

03:14.825 --> 03:16.697
WELL,
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT,

03:16.697 --> 03:18.569
AND I HAVE
EXTRAORDINARY VISION...

03:18.569 --> 03:20.331
(imitates British accent)
LITERALLY AND FIGURATIVELY.

03:20.331 --> 03:22.473
(laughs) COME ON.
TIME TO GO ROUND ON WEBBER.

03:22.473 --> 03:24.935
(slam)
OW!

03:24.935 --> 03:27.778
ARE YOU SURE
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO HOME?

03:29.540 --> 03:31.912
(Jo clears throat)
(whispers) OKAY.

03:31.912 --> 03:34.915
HEY, KIDS.
YOU GOT HALLOWEEN PLANS?
(woman) I'LL TAKE IT.

03:34.915 --> 03:37.217
YEAH, MATTHEW'S HAVING A THING.
I'M GOING AS A BUNNY.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.319
OOH. PLAYBOY?

03:38.319 --> 03:39.350
UH, VELVETEEN.

03:39.350 --> 03:40.721
(elevator bell dings)
NEEDS WORK.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.424
HOW ABOUT YOU, LONE RANGER?
ARE YOU AND EMMA GOING OUT?

03:43.424 --> 03:45.356
UH, EMMA AND I
ARE NO LONGER A THING.

03:45.356 --> 03:47.428
WHAT? WHY?

03:47.428 --> 03:48.899
WELL, IT'S JUST TOO SOON.
I'M NOT READY.

03:48.899 --> 03:51.302
YES, YOU ARE.

03:51.302 --> 03:52.733
EMMA DOESN'T THINK SO,

03:52.733 --> 03:54.965
BECAUSE I NEVER MENTIONED
BEING MARRIED BEFORE.

03:54.965 --> 03:56.867
SHE SAID, "CALL ME
WHEN YOU'RE READY."

03:56.867 --> 03:58.969
YOU'RE READY.
DON'T YOU THINK HE'S READY?

03:58.969 --> 04:00.971
WELL, MAYBE HE'S READY,
BUT HE'S NOT READY TO CALL.

04:00.971 --> 04:02.543
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
HE'S READY.

04:02.543 --> 04:03.744
YOU SHOULD...

04:03.744 --> 04:05.746
HMM.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.549
HE'S NOT READY.
NOT READY.

04:08.549 --> 04:10.451
HEY, UM, I HAVE
THE COSTUME IN MY CAR.

04:10.451 --> 04:12.283
WHAT TIME DID YOU
WANNA MEET?

04:12.283 --> 04:15.456
NO, I HAVE THE COSTUME.
OH, PLEASE, DON'T TELL ME
WE HAVE TWO ASTRONAUT COSTUMES.

04:15.456 --> 04:16.887
WE DON'T.
WE HAVE A PRINCESS.

04:16.887 --> 04:17.988
WHAT?
YEAH.

04:17.988 --> 04:19.330
YOU--WHAT--THAT'S WHAT
YOU WANT--

04:19.330 --> 04:20.961
YOU WANT HER TO STRIVE
TO BE A PRINCESS?

04:20.961 --> 04:22.763
NO, IT'S WHAT SHE WANTS.
IT'S WHAT SHE ASKED FOR.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.865
NO, NO, NO, NO. SHE TOLD ME
SHE WANTED TO BE AN ASTRONAUT,

04:24.865 --> 04:26.867
AND THAT'S WHY I SPENT
THREE HOURS LAST NIGHT

04:26.867 --> 04:28.869
SEWING PATCHES
ON A LITTLE, TINY FLIGHT SUIT.

04:28.869 --> 04:31.041
YEAH, WELL, I SPENT THE NIGHT
GLUING DAISIES ON A TUTU.

04:31.041 --> 04:32.803
FINE. WE CAN HOLD UP
THE COSTUMES,

04:32.803 --> 04:34.805
AND SHE CAN DECIDE
WHOSE WORK SHE LOVES MORE.

04:34.805 --> 04:37.948
(scoffs) YOU KNOW WHAT?
FORGET IT. YOU TAKE HER.

04:37.948 --> 04:39.880
(whispers)
I'M NOT DOING THIS.

04:41.312 --> 04:42.613
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
(Richard) AS THE GRAVE.

04:42.613 --> 04:45.015
THAT IS AMAZING.
WHAT'S AMAZING?

04:45.015 --> 04:48.389
DR. WEBBER WANTS ONE OF US
TO DO HIS SURGERY TODAY.

04:48.389 --> 04:50.821
OH... NOT YOU.
N-NO OFFENSE,

04:50.821 --> 04:53.394
BUT I HEARD YOU WALKED
INTO A WALL THIS MORNING.
(elevator bell dings)

04:53.394 --> 04:54.865
UH, WHY NOT ME?
WELL, YOU CAN SUPERVISE.

04:54.865 --> 04:56.026
THEY KNOW THIS PROCEDURE
INSIDE OUT.

04:56.026 --> 04:57.928
THEY'RE--THEY'RE READY.
I BEG TO DIFFER.

04:57.928 --> 05:00.931
(clears throat) HOW DO YOU DO
A TRANSGASTRIC APPROACH?

05:00.931 --> 05:04.835
ANTERIOR GASTROTOMY FOR ACCESS
AND CYSTOGASTROSTOMY CREATION

05:04.835 --> 05:06.036
THROUGH THE POSTERIOR WALL.

05:06.036 --> 05:07.408
WHAT ABOUT
THE POSTERIOR APPROACH?

05:07.408 --> 05:08.909
THAT IS A SINGLE GASTROTOMY
IN CONTINUITY

05:08.909 --> 05:10.341
WITH THE PSEUDOCYST.

05:10.341 --> 05:13.013
VERY NICE, AND WHICH IS
THE EASIEST APPROACH?

05:13.013 --> 05:14.585
IT'D HAVE TO BE
THE INTRALUMINAL APPROACH.

05:14.585 --> 05:16.487
UNLESS YOU'RE A FAN
OF INTRAOPERATIVE BLEEDING,

05:16.487 --> 05:17.848
IN WHICH CASE,
DO WHAT YOU LIKE.

05:17.848 --> 05:20.391
I THOUGHT I WASN'T SEEING YOU
UNTIL THE WEEKEND.

05:20.391 --> 05:22.393
AH, I COULDN'T MISS
TRICK-OR-TREATING.

05:22.393 --> 05:23.854
JUST DIDN'T SEEM RIGHT.

05:23.854 --> 05:25.025
GOOD MAN.

05:25.025 --> 05:26.927
THAT'S A BOLD MOVE,
LETTING THE SECOND YEARS

05:26.927 --> 05:28.959
TRY A PROCEDURE LIKE THIS
ON YOU. HOW YOU GONNA PICK?

05:28.959 --> 05:32.002
BAILEY, WATCH THEM
IN THE E.R. TODAY.

05:32.002 --> 05:34.635
TELL ME WHICH ONE
DESERVES IT.
NONE OF 'EM DO,

05:34.635 --> 05:37.037
AND I DON'T NEED TO SPEND A DAY
IN THE E.R.--
DR. BAILEY, THAT'S ALL.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.839
GET OUT OF HERE.
WE'RE GONNA REVIEW

05:38.839 --> 05:41.011
AN INTRALUMINAL APPROACH.

05:41.011 --> 05:43.043
(huffs)
COME ON.

05:44.975 --> 05:48.048
OKAY, SO,
YOU, ME, AND TUCK--

05:48.048 --> 05:49.950
WE SHOULD THINK OF COSTUMES
THAT HAVE THREE PARTS,

05:49.950 --> 05:51.351
LIKE THE THREE STOOGES.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.883
I HAVE A WITCH'S HAT.
I PUT IT ON EVERY YEAR

05:52.883 --> 05:54.054
AND CALL IT A DAY.
(elevator bell dings)

05:54.054 --> 05:55.826
MY DAY IS GONNA BE

05:55.826 --> 05:58.729
ABOUT WHICH OF THOSE THREE
RESIDENTS IS GONNA KILL

05:58.729 --> 06:01.031
THE MOST IMPORTANT PATIENT
I'VE EVER HAD.

06:01.031 --> 06:05.065
HALLOWEEN WAS... KIND OF
MY FAMILY'S THING,

06:05.065 --> 06:07.938
AND I WANT IT TO BE
OUR FAMILY'S THING,

06:07.938 --> 06:09.940
SO GO WORK.
I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

06:09.940 --> 06:12.573
YOU JUST COME WITH ME
AT THE END OF THE DAY

06:12.573 --> 06:14.605
WITH THAT FACE
AND THAT BODY AND THE...

06:14.605 --> 06:16.407
(gasps)

06:16.407 --> 06:18.949
I'LL FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO PUT ON IT.

06:18.949 --> 06:20.881
(huffs)
(chuckles)

06:20.881 --> 06:23.383
IT'S A HOLIDAY
FOR CHILDREN, YOU KNOW.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.556
(woman) VICTOR BROWN--

06:25.556 --> 06:27.588
30-YEAR-OLD MALE MAULING VICTIM.
VITALS ARE STABLE.

06:27.588 --> 06:28.889
LET'S GET HIM TO TRAUMA.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.992
WHAT MAULED HIM?
HE--HE TACKLED ME.
HE CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.

06:31.992 --> 06:32.893
WAIT. WHO IS "HE"?
THE GUY--

06:32.893 --> 06:34.394
HE WAS SNARLING AND GROWLING.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.796
I'M SORRY.
A PERSON DID THIS TO YOU?

06:35.796 --> 06:39.600
HE STARTED EATING MY FACE
LIKE SOME SORT OF...

06:39.600 --> 06:42.473
ZOMBIE?
MURPHY? EDWARDS?

06:42.473 --> 06:44.104
IT'S THE BITER.
MULTIPLE G.S.W.s TO THE CHEST.

06:44.104 --> 06:45.936
B.P. 90 OVER 60.
(grunting)

06:45.936 --> 06:48.038
PULSE IN THE 120s.
HE'S ON SOMETHING.

06:48.038 --> 06:50.410
HOW IS THIS GUY STABLE? HE'S GOT
TWO BULLET HOLES OVER HIS HEART.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.543
COPS SHOT HIM BEFORE HE ATE
THAT OTHER GUY'S WHOLE FACE OFF.

06:52.543 --> 06:54.945
AND HE GOT 4 OF LORAZEPAM.
(gurney clacking)

06:54.945 --> 06:57.548
BARELY SLOWED HIM DOWN.
I WANT HIM SEDATED NOW.

06:57.548 --> 06:59.049
PUSH 2 OF LORAZEPAM
AND 5 OF HALDOL.

06:59.049 --> 07:00.691
(drawer opens, objects rustling)

07:00.691 --> 07:01.922
THIS GUY SHOULD NOT BE ALIVE.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.454
GUYS, I CAN BARELY HEAR
HIS HEART.

07:03.454 --> 07:04.525
(growling)

07:04.525 --> 07:08.529
(screaming)

07:16.867 --> 07:18.669
OW.

07:18.669 --> 07:19.840
SORRY.
IT'S PRETTY DEEP.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.141
JUST PATCH ME UP.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.013
THERE'S NO WAY I'M MISSING OUT
ON WEBBER'S SURGERY

07:23.013 --> 07:25.175
BECAUSE OF A LITTLE NECK LAC.
OH, YES, YOU ARE.

07:25.175 --> 07:26.577
(Jo, Leah, and Stephanie scream)

07:26.577 --> 07:27.948
WHERE DID YOU COME FROM?

07:27.948 --> 07:30.721
I'M EVERYWHERE,
AND YOU ARE NOT GOING

07:30.721 --> 07:32.452
INTO AN O.R.
WITH AN OPEN WOUND.

07:32.452 --> 07:35.455
YOU NEED TO GET YOURSELF TESTED
AND RUN AN INFECTIOUS PANEL,

07:35.455 --> 07:38.088
INCLUDING RAPID H.I.V. ON HIM

07:38.088 --> 07:40.060
AND WHOEVER'S BLOOD
WAS IN HIS MOUTH.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.663
HOLD UP.

07:42.663 --> 07:43.794
(squish)
OW.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.539
IS THAT A...
TOOTH.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.642
ONE...

07:51.642 --> 07:52.973
DOWN.

07:56.877 --> 08:00.511
(emergency radio chatter)

08:00.511 --> 08:02.082
WHAT?

08:02.082 --> 08:04.114
SAY "TRICK OR TREAT."
NO.

08:04.114 --> 08:05.616
GOD,
YOU'RE NO FUN SOMETIMES.

08:05.616 --> 08:08.519
TRICK OR TREAT. WHAT?
A TREAT FOR YOU.

08:08.519 --> 08:10.220
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
THE X-RAYS ARE BACKWARDS.

08:10.220 --> 08:11.662
NO, THEY'RE NOT.

08:11.662 --> 08:13.093
THE ORGANS ARE.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.565
NO WAY.
MM-HMM.

08:14.565 --> 08:15.495
HE HAS SITUS INVERSUS?

08:15.495 --> 08:17.768
ALL HIS ORGANS
ARE COMPLETELY BACKWARDS,

08:17.768 --> 08:18.799
MIRRORED
TO THE NORMAL POSITION.

08:18.799 --> 08:21.532
THIS GUY WAS SHOT
TWICE IN THE CHEST.

08:21.532 --> 08:23.774
HE DIDN'T DIE. MURPHY COULD
BARELY FIND A HEARTBEAT,

08:23.774 --> 08:25.636
BUT IT TURNS OUT HIS HEART
WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.

08:25.636 --> 08:27.678
I HAVE WANTED TO SEE THIS
SINCE MED SCHOOL.

08:27.678 --> 08:28.779
I KNOW THAT.

08:28.779 --> 08:30.611
HAPPY HALLOWEEN.

08:32.713 --> 08:35.515
IT STARTED LAST NIGHT.
SHE LOVES HALLOWEEN.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.688
SHE'S BEEN IN THIS COSTUME
FOR DAYS.

08:37.688 --> 08:39.620
AND I HAVE TO GO OUT OF TOWN
TODAY FOR WORK.
(cell phone buzzes)

08:39.620 --> 08:42.553
LAST TRIP WAS BRAZIL.
I GOT TO GO, TOO.

08:42.553 --> 08:43.654
AND I COULDN'T TAKE HER
WITH ME ON THIS ONE,

08:43.654 --> 08:45.255
SO WE HAD HALLOWEEN EARLY.

08:45.255 --> 08:48.298
WE WATCHED PART
OF A SCARY MOVIE, AND--
(buzz)

08:48.298 --> 08:50.100
"POLTERGEIST."
IT WAS AWESOME.

08:50.100 --> 08:52.603
(chuckles)
I PAGED DR. ROBBINS.

08:52.603 --> 08:54.635
NO, YOU PAGED PEDS.
YOU GOT ME.

08:54.635 --> 08:57.307
TARYN, I'M DR. KAREV.
SO, UH, YOU HAVE A STOMACHACHE.

08:57.307 --> 08:59.610
YOU DON'T KNOW ANY MAGIC SPELLS
TO FIX IT?

08:59.610 --> 09:02.012
NO.
WELL, WE HAD SOME CANDY
LAST NIGHT DURING THE MOVIE,

09:02.012 --> 09:03.714
AND SHE GOT SICK...
A FEW TIMES.

09:03.714 --> 09:06.577
CANDY FOR DINNER. NICE.

09:06.577 --> 09:08.248
OW.
ALL RIGHT, SHE HAS SOME GUARDING
AND A FEVER,

09:08.248 --> 09:10.220
SO IT'S PROBABLY NOT THE CANDY.
(buzz)

09:10.220 --> 09:12.182
I'D LIKE TO DO FURTHER TESTING.
DRAW LABS.

09:12.182 --> 09:16.627
I STILL GET TO
TRICK-OR-TREAT, RIGHT?

09:16.627 --> 09:20.130
ARE YOU KIDDING? THE BEST
TRICK-OR-TREATING IN SEATTLE

09:20.130 --> 09:21.892
IS RIGHT HERE
ON THE PEDS FLOOR.

09:21.892 --> 09:23.834
YOU GO AROUND
WITH THESE HUGE PILLOWCASES.

09:23.834 --> 09:27.067
EVERYONE HANDS OUT AS MUCH CANDY
AS YOU CAN CARRY.

09:29.169 --> 09:30.641
(lisping) HE DIDN'T DIE.

09:30.641 --> 09:33.073
THEY SHOT HIM IN THE HEART
TWICE, AND HE DIDN'T DIE.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.344
I THOUGHT HE WAS JUST CRAZY.

09:34.344 --> 09:37.007
HE WAS JUST CRAZY.
THEN WHY DIDN'T HE DIE?!

09:37.007 --> 09:38.008
I'VE GOT A NEEDLE
RIGHT NEXT TO YOUR FACE.

09:38.008 --> 09:40.250
I NEED YOU TO CALM IT DOWN,
OKAY?

09:40.250 --> 09:41.882
IS THERE ANY PAIN ELSEWHERE?

09:41.882 --> 09:42.883
IT'S JUST SORE.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.314
AND STIFF.

09:44.314 --> 09:46.256
OH, MY GOD.

09:46.256 --> 09:47.888
IS THIS RIGOR MORTIS?

09:47.888 --> 09:51.361
VICTOR, ZOMBIES AREN'T REAL.
WE KNOW THIS, RIGHT?

09:51.361 --> 09:54.064
YOU. YOU SHOULD...
(monitor beeping rapidly)

09:54.064 --> 09:57.197
QUA-QUARANTINE...
VICTOR, SQUEEZE MY HAND.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.369
DID YOU HIT YOUR HEAD
WHEN HE ATTACKED YOU?
YOU SHOULD QUARANTINE--

09:59.369 --> 10:00.931
CAN YOU SMILE FOR ME, BUDDY?

10:00.931 --> 10:02.903
UH...
NO, HE'S HAVING A STROKE.

10:02.903 --> 10:05.035
THERE'S PULSATILE MASS.
COULD BE DAMAGE TO THE CAROTID.

10:05.035 --> 10:06.637
MAYBE A PSEUDOANEURYSM.
ALL RIGHT,
GET THE ULTRASOUND.

10:06.637 --> 10:07.678
I'M GONNA BOOK AN O.R.

10:07.678 --> 10:09.079
MRS. WILTERN?

10:09.079 --> 10:11.311
UH, WALKER. MARGE WALKER.

10:11.311 --> 10:12.913
TAKE ME HOME, PHILIP.

10:12.913 --> 10:16.186
MOM? UH, SORRY. SHE'S A LITTLE
AFRAID OF HOSPITALS.

10:16.186 --> 10:19.720
OH. WELL, IN THAT CASE,
I'LL BE VERY, VERY GENTLE, OKAY?

10:19.720 --> 10:21.351
UH, IT SAYS YOU HURT
YOUR LEG?

10:21.351 --> 10:24.624
SHE SAYS IT WAS A BUG BITE
OR SOMETHING. IT GOT INFECTED,

10:24.624 --> 10:26.356
AND SHE SAYS IT HURTS LIKE HECK.

10:26.356 --> 10:28.328
SHE'S BEEN POPPING IBUPROFEN
LIKE IT'S CANDY.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.060
I HAD TO DRAG HER IN HERE.

10:30.060 --> 10:32.733
IT'S FINE.
PHILIP, TAKE ME HOME.

10:32.733 --> 10:35.135
MOM, NO. NOT UNTIL YOU LET HER
CHECK IT OUT.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.737
JUST TRY TO RELAX,
OKAY?

10:36.737 --> 10:37.968
I'M GONNA TAKE A LOOK.

10:37.968 --> 10:41.742
(insect buzzing)

10:41.742 --> 10:43.714
UH...
WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?

10:43.714 --> 10:45.145
ABOUT FOUR MONTHS AGO.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.948
FOUR MONTHS AGO?

10:47.948 --> 10:50.080
(gasps)

10:52.052 --> 10:53.353
(Steph) MAGGOTS.

10:53.353 --> 10:54.855
GROSS.
WRITHING AND PULSING.

10:54.855 --> 10:57.958
WE KNOW WHAT MAGGOTS ARE.
AT FIRST, THEY WERE
A LITTLE BIT BLURRY

10:57.958 --> 10:59.359
BECAUSE MY EYES--
I JUST HAD EYE SURGERY.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.692
WHAT? WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

11:01.692 --> 11:03.663
I'M FINE.
YOU SHOULDN'T BE SEEING
PATIENTS.

11:03.663 --> 11:04.394
BUT I WANNA BE HELPFUL.

11:04.394 --> 11:06.166
WELL, GREAT. THEN YOU CAN GO
TO THE STORE

11:06.166 --> 11:07.938
ANY BUY SOME HALLOWEEN CANDY.

11:07.938 --> 11:09.840
NAME BRANDS--NONE OF THOSE
SMARTEES OR CANDY CORNS.

11:09.840 --> 11:11.401
BUT I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO DRIVE.

11:11.401 --> 11:12.973
LUCKILY, SOMEONE INVENTED
THE BUS PASS.

11:12.973 --> 11:14.404
COME ON, GREY. YOU'RE NOT GONNA
MAKE HER TAKE THE BUS.

11:14.404 --> 11:15.846
THANK YOU, DR. TORRES.

11:15.846 --> 11:17.447
THERE'S A SHOP JUST UP
THE STREET. YOU CAN WALK.

11:17.447 --> 11:19.679
(elevator bell dings)

11:19.679 --> 11:22.352
YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR WHAT AGAIN?

11:22.352 --> 11:23.954
YOU KNOW, ONE OF THOSE
LITTLE HEAD MIRRORS,

11:23.954 --> 11:25.355
THAT DOCTORS WEAR.

11:25.355 --> 11:27.087
BEN, YOU ARE A DOCTOR.

11:27.087 --> 11:29.059
HAVE YOU EVER WORN ONE?
NO.

11:29.059 --> 11:32.092
BECAUSE THEY STOPPED USING THEM
A CENTURY AGO. (laughs)

11:32.092 --> 11:33.323
WHAT ARE THEY TEACHING YOU
DOWN THERE?

11:33.323 --> 11:35.325
TUCK WANTS TO BE
A MAD SCIENTIST TONIGHT.

11:35.325 --> 11:37.127
HE SHOULD HAVE ONE OF THOSE
LITTLE HEAD MIRROR THINGS.

11:37.127 --> 11:38.468
WELL, I HAVE
A BRAIN IN A JAR.

11:38.468 --> 11:41.131
BUT I WANNA GIVE HIM A COSTUME,
NOT A NIGHTMARE.

11:41.131 --> 11:43.033
WHAT DID HE DO TO YOU?

11:43.033 --> 11:44.775
TORRES AND I ARE WORKING ON
THOUGHT CONTROL PROSTHETICS.

11:44.775 --> 11:46.907
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO INSERT THE SENSORS

11:46.907 --> 11:48.879
THROUGH A SMALLER CRANIOTOMY.

11:48.879 --> 11:51.441
OHH. YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED
OF YOURSELF.

11:51.441 --> 11:54.044
I'M SORRY? OH, WELL,
THAT'S FOR ZOLA TONIGHT.

11:54.044 --> 11:55.185
IT WAS RIPPED. I FIXED IT.

11:55.185 --> 11:56.747
(scoffs) YEAH,
IF YOU CALL THIS FIXED.

11:56.747 --> 11:58.348
YEAH, I COULD DO
A RUNNING WHIPSTITCH SO SMOOTH

11:58.348 --> 12:01.121
THE BUTTERFLY WOULD NEVER EVEN
KNOW THERE'D BEEN A RUPTURE.

12:01.121 --> 12:03.393
WHAT ARE YOU TEACHING
UP HERE?

12:03.393 --> 12:04.454
(gasping and groaning)
I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A BIOPSY

12:04.454 --> 12:06.226
TO SEE IF THE INFECTION'S
GOTTEN INTO THE BONE.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.898
AND WE ARE GONNA NEED TO
TAKE YOU DOWN TO THE O.R.

12:07.898 --> 12:10.200
TO CLEAN THE PARASITES
OUT OF THAT WOUND.

12:10.200 --> 12:11.902
NO! NO! TAKE ME HOME!

12:11.902 --> 12:13.033
MOM.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.364
TAKE ME HOME!
NO, NO, NO. MOM. MOM. MOM.

12:14.364 --> 12:16.236
WE--WE CAN GIVE YOU A SEDATIVE
TO EASE THE ANXIETY.

12:16.236 --> 12:19.439
NO! NO NEEDLES! NO NEEDLES!
JUST GO AWAY!

12:19.439 --> 12:23.013
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE! DON'T!
JUST GO AWAY! DON'T--OH! (cries)

12:25.075 --> 12:26.376
SHE'S ALWAYS HATED DOCTORS,

12:26.376 --> 12:28.779
BUT IT'S GOTTEN OUT OF CONTROL
SINCE MY DAD DIED.

12:28.779 --> 12:30.781
I DON'T WANT TO SOUND CRUEL,

12:30.781 --> 12:31.952
BUT CAN'T YOU JUST PUT HER
IN RESTRAINTS

12:31.952 --> 12:34.254
AND GIVE HER A SEDATIVE
OR SOMETHING?

12:34.254 --> 12:37.157
WELL...
I HAVE AN IDEA. I'M GOING TO
THE GIFT SHOP. I'LL BE BACK.

12:39.860 --> 12:43.163
UH, PUT HER IN BED 3.
GET AN X-RAY OF THE ANKLE.

12:44.835 --> 12:46.436
(groans)
BED 5 SHOULD BE EMPTY.

12:46.436 --> 12:48.368
GET A RAPID INFLUENZA.
COULD BE THE FLU.
RIGHT AWAY, DOCTOR.

12:50.500 --> 12:53.003
UH, MA'AM?

12:53.003 --> 12:54.404
(labored breathing)

12:54.404 --> 12:56.406
I'M WAITING FOR MY DOCTOR.

12:56.406 --> 12:59.409
WELL, I'M YOUR DOCTOR NOW,
SO...

13:00.911 --> 13:02.983
WHAT'S YOUR DOCTOR'S NAME?
MAYBE I CAN FIND THEM.

13:02.983 --> 13:07.157
DR. BROOKS.

13:07.157 --> 13:09.159
HEATHER BROOKS.

13:09.159 --> 13:11.321
I'M SORRY. SHE'S NOT HERE.

13:11.321 --> 13:13.523
YES, SHE IS.

13:13.523 --> 13:15.996
SHE'S ALWAYS HERE.

13:15.996 --> 13:20.500
(labored breathing,
wheezing)

13:26.937 --> 13:28.979
SHE SAID SHE'LL ONLY SEE
HEATHER BROOKS.

13:28.979 --> 13:30.580
CAN I TELL HER
ABOUT HEATHER?

13:30.580 --> 13:33.383
YOU WANNA TELL A SICK OLD LADY
HER FAVORITE DOCTOR IS DEAD?

13:33.383 --> 13:35.115
THAT SEEM LIKE A GOOD IDEA
TO YOU?

13:35.115 --> 13:37.487
NO. IT'S JUST, SHE'S PRETTY
INSISTENT ON SEEING DR. BROOKS.

13:37.487 --> 13:40.090
THEN TELL HER IT'S NOT POSSIBLE
AND TREAT HER YOURSELF.

13:40.090 --> 13:42.853
UM... WHERE IS SHE?

13:42.853 --> 13:45.125
I DON'T KNOW. SHE WAS
RIGHT THERE A SECOND AGO.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.256
(scoffs)

13:46.256 --> 13:49.199
UH, MURPHY'S BITTEN,
EDWARDS IS BLIND,

13:49.199 --> 13:50.360
AND YOU'RE BONKERS.

13:50.360 --> 13:51.601
NO! I--

13:51.601 --> 13:53.203
ANOTHER ONE DOWN.

13:53.203 --> 13:54.534
(elevator bell dings)

13:54.534 --> 13:56.166
(indistinct conversations)

13:56.166 --> 13:57.407
HOLY...

13:57.407 --> 14:00.871
MA'AM, I'D LIKE TO GET YOU
STARTED ON MEDICATION.

14:00.871 --> 14:03.473
I NEED TO KNOW YOUR NAME
SO WE CAN GET YOU REGISTERED.

14:03.473 --> 14:06.116
(raspy voice) NO, I'LL--
I'LL WAIT FOR DOCTOR--

14:06.116 --> 14:08.879
DR. BROOKS ISN'T HERE.
I AM.

14:08.879 --> 14:10.220
JUST TELL ME YOUR NAME.

14:10.220 --> 14:13.553
IF YOU DON'T, I'LL HAVE TO GO
THROUGH ALL DR. BROOKS' CHARTS.

14:13.553 --> 14:16.086
HOW ABOUT YOU SAVE ME ALL THAT
TROUBLE AND TELL ME YOUR NAME?

14:16.086 --> 14:18.058
SHE'LL COME.

14:18.058 --> 14:19.289
(wheezes)

14:19.289 --> 14:21.431
(telephone rings)

14:21.431 --> 14:22.993
(Owen) OKAY, I'M TRACKING
ONE OF THE BULLETS

14:22.993 --> 14:25.165
THROUGH THE ACCESSORY LOBE.

14:25.165 --> 14:26.596
(suction gurgling)
THAT'S THE MIDDLE LOBE.

14:26.596 --> 14:28.068
RIGHT. RIGHT.

14:28.068 --> 14:29.639
IT'S THE RIGHT LUNG.

14:29.639 --> 14:31.001
MM-HMM.
(scoffs)

14:31.001 --> 14:32.572
THIS IS LIKE...
DRIVING IN ENGLAND.

14:32.572 --> 14:36.046
(chuckles)
YOU KNOW, I HAD TO KEEP THINKING
ABOUT EVERY MOVE THAT I MAKE.

14:36.046 --> 14:38.208
IT'S GONNA TAKE TWICE AS LONG
AS IT SHOULD.

14:38.208 --> 14:40.981
OKAY.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.582
YOU GOT PLANS TONIGHT?

14:42.582 --> 14:47.217
(sighs) MEREDITH SEMI-INVITED ME
TO THIS BABYFEST TONIGHT.

14:47.217 --> 14:48.989
BUT I CAN'T TELL IF
SHE REALLY WANTS ME TO GO

14:48.989 --> 14:50.290
OR IF SHE JUST FELT
SHE HAD TO ASK.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.162
IT'S SO COMPLICATED.
RIGHT?

14:52.162 --> 14:54.224
SHE AND I JUST USED TO KNOW
WHAT THE OTHER ONE WAS THINKING.

14:54.224 --> 14:55.395
I MEANT THIS.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.667
(monitor beeping rapidly)

14:57.667 --> 14:59.629
THERE'S STILL BLEEDING
IN THE UPPER LOBE.

14:59.629 --> 15:01.601
(suction gurgling)
I NEED MORE PROXIMAL CONTROL.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.073
DUVAL LUNG CLAMP.

15:03.073 --> 15:05.075
STRAIGHT VASCULAR CLAMP,
PLEASE.

15:05.075 --> 15:06.977
OKAY.
OH, WATCH OUT FOR THE S.--

15:06.977 --> 15:08.208
AH.
V.C.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.210
NICKED THE S.V.C.
IT SHOULDN'T EVEN BE THERE!

15:10.210 --> 15:13.113
I GOT YOU THIS SO YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SHUT YOUR EYES SO TIGHT.

15:13.113 --> 15:15.685
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEE.
YOU WANNA TRY IT?

15:15.685 --> 15:19.049
(siren wailing in distance)

15:22.092 --> 15:24.054
OH.
YEAH.

15:24.054 --> 15:25.155
SO LET'S FORGET
WE'RE IN A HOSPITAL.

15:25.155 --> 15:27.157
LET'S TALK ABOUT HALLOWEEN.

15:27.157 --> 15:28.158
DO YOU GET A LOT OF KIDS
AT YOUR HOUSE?

15:28.158 --> 15:29.129
NO.

15:29.129 --> 15:31.701
OH. TOO BAD.

15:31.701 --> 15:33.933
ALL THE KIDS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
ARE PHILIP'S AGE.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.365
THEY'RE ALL GROWN UP
AND GONE.

15:35.365 --> 15:39.139
BUT WHEN HE WAS LITTLE...

15:39.139 --> 15:41.341
(chuckles) IT WAS NUTS.

15:41.341 --> 15:42.973
A REAL MADHOUSE, HUH?

15:42.973 --> 15:44.544
YEAH, KIDS EVERYWHERE.

15:44.544 --> 15:47.377
PHILIP LOVED IT--
HIS FAVORITE HOLIDAY.

15:47.377 --> 15:49.649
HE ALWAYS NEEDED A COSTUME THEY
DIDN'T SELL IN THE STORES...

15:49.649 --> 15:50.720
(rails clank)

15:50.720 --> 15:52.122
AND I ALWAYS NEEDED
TO MAKE IT.

15:52.122 --> 15:53.623
WHAT'S HAPPENING?!
(rails click)

15:53.623 --> 15:55.185
IT'S OKAY. WE'RE JUST, UH,
WE'RE GONNA TAKE A LITTLE WALK.

15:55.185 --> 15:57.127
WE'RE GONNA GO DOWN TO THE O.R.
AND GET YOU A GOWN.

15:57.127 --> 15:58.288
IS THAT OKAY?

15:58.288 --> 16:00.190
YEAH. YEAH, FINE.

16:00.190 --> 16:01.191
IT'S OKAY.

16:01.191 --> 16:03.133
(whimpers)
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

16:03.133 --> 16:06.136
SO... YOU MADE ALL HIS COSTUMES
FROM SCRATCH, HUH?

16:06.136 --> 16:08.198
WHAT DID HE GO AS?

16:08.198 --> 16:10.640
WELL, ONE YEAR,
HE WENT AS AN AARDVARK.

16:10.640 --> 16:14.204
(indistinct conversations,
siren wailing in distance)

16:14.204 --> 16:16.476
TARYN'S LABS SHOW A SLIGHTLY
ELEVATED WHITE COUNT,

16:16.476 --> 16:19.179
AND SOME OF
HER ELECTROLYTES ARE OFF.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.151
IS SHE GONNA BE HERE
OVERNIGHT?

16:21.151 --> 16:22.182
IT'S JUST THAT HER DAD
WANTS TO KNOW

16:22.182 --> 16:23.513
IF HE SHOULD CHANGE
HIS FLIGHT.

16:23.513 --> 16:26.186
YEAH, HIS 8-YEAR-OLD HAS
A POTENTIALLY SURGICAL ABDOMEN.

16:26.186 --> 16:29.319
SHE NEEDS A C.T. SHE'S IN PAIN.
HE SHOULD CHANGE HIS FLIGHT.

16:29.319 --> 16:32.362
DUDE, WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

16:32.362 --> 16:34.564
I KNOW YOU THINK HE'S AN ASS,
BUT HE'S NOT.

16:34.564 --> 16:35.595
HE'S NOT YOUR DAD.

16:35.595 --> 16:36.696
DON'T EVEN--
WHAT?

16:36.696 --> 16:38.298
PRETEND THAT YOU'RE
NOT ANGRY

16:38.298 --> 16:39.429
AND HURT
AND ABOUT TO EXPLODE?

16:39.429 --> 16:42.232
I'VE BEEN DOING THAT.
IT'S NOT WORKING.

16:42.232 --> 16:45.175
TELL ME WHAT I CAN DO
TO MAKE THIS BETTER.

16:45.175 --> 16:48.078
JUST GET A C.T.
(clipboard clatters)

16:50.040 --> 16:52.712
(wheels clacking)
(chuckles) SO I THOUGHT
THE SECOND ONE WOULD BE EASIER,

16:52.712 --> 16:54.614
BUT IT'S JUST LIKE
HAVING ONE ALL OVER AGAIN,

16:54.614 --> 16:56.146
EXCEPT NOW THERE ARE TWO.

16:56.146 --> 16:58.118
SO YOU'RE TWICE
AS EXHAUSTED.
(chuckles)

16:58.118 --> 16:59.519
(chuckles)
(lowered voice)
OKAY, WE'RE ALL SET.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.592
OKAY. OKAY, MARGE,
WE'RE IN THE O.R.
(gasps)

17:02.592 --> 17:05.055
AND WE ARE READY TO OPERATE.

17:05.055 --> 17:08.158
YOU'LL BE HERE
THE WHOLE TIME, MEREDITH?
THE WHOLE TIME.

17:08.158 --> 17:11.601
OKAY. YES.

17:11.601 --> 17:14.064
I'M READY.
OKAY.

17:14.064 --> 17:16.066
YOU KNOW, IF YOU
SEGMENTED THE WINGS,

17:16.066 --> 17:17.437
THEN SHE'D FLAP
WHEN SHE MOVED.

17:17.437 --> 17:18.638
SHE JUST HAS TO LOOK
LIKE A BUTTERFLY.

17:18.638 --> 17:20.370
SHE DOESN'T ACTUALLY
HAVE TO FLY.

17:20.370 --> 17:23.243
HOW'D YOU SWING
THE TIME OFF?

17:23.243 --> 17:25.815
YOU KNOW, I, UH,
I JUST MADE IT HAPPEN.

17:25.815 --> 17:28.178
HALLOWEEN WAS ALWAYS
MY FAVORITE NIGHT AS A KID,

17:28.178 --> 17:30.220
AND I JUST WANTED TO SPEND IT
WITH MY FAMILY, YOU KNOW?

17:30.220 --> 17:31.451
YOU'RE SO DOMESTICATED.

17:31.451 --> 17:33.753
(chuckles) YOU'RE SUTURING
A BUTTERFLY COSTUME.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.655
YOU KNOW, UH...

17:35.655 --> 17:37.056
YOU KNOW, IF WE ATTACH THIS
TO HER WRIST

17:37.056 --> 17:39.159
WITH STRINGS,
IT'D SORT OF FAN OUT.

17:39.159 --> 17:42.162
THAT'S A BRILLIANT IDEA.

17:42.162 --> 17:44.264
RIGHT.
IT'S TOTALLY WORTH IT.

17:44.264 --> 17:46.696
YEAH, KEEP STITCHING.

17:50.840 --> 17:53.573
THEY'RE INCOMPETENT.
IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT,

17:53.573 --> 17:55.405
BECAUSE IT'S HOW
THEY WERE RAISED.

17:55.405 --> 17:59.449
THESE DAYS, PARENTS THINK
ALL OF THEIR KIDS ARE GENIUSES.

17:59.449 --> 18:01.111
AND EVERYONE GETS A TROPHY

18:01.111 --> 18:03.153
JUST FOR BEING
ON THE SOCCER TEAM.

18:03.153 --> 18:04.584
AND--
THEY'RE NOT THE PROBLEM.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.116
YOU ARE.

18:06.116 --> 18:09.159
I'M TRYING TO TEACH THEM,
AND YOU WON'T LET THEM LEARN.

18:09.159 --> 18:12.091
I CAN BARELY
GET OUT OF THIS BED.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.793
I CAN'T OPERATE.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.765
WHO KNOWS IF I EVER WILL?

18:15.765 --> 18:18.428
THE ONLY THING
THAT GIVES ME SOME MEANING.

18:18.428 --> 18:21.401
HELL, SOME DAYS THE ONLY THING
THAT KEEPS ME GOING...

18:21.401 --> 18:22.872
IS TEACHING THEM.

18:22.872 --> 18:26.806
AND--AND YOU'RE STANDING
IN THE WAY OF THAT.

18:26.806 --> 18:29.409
SO I'M GONNA HAVE
SOMEONE ELSE SUPERVISE 'EM.

18:34.184 --> 18:36.186
YOU'RE NOT KICKING ME
OFF THIS CASE.

18:36.186 --> 18:37.217
YES, I AM.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.121
THIS IS WHY
WHEN I FIRE SOMEONE,

18:42.121 --> 18:44.894
I LIKE TO DO IT
IN THEIR OFFICE.

18:46.896 --> 18:49.799
SO I CAN WALK OUT.

18:49.799 --> 18:52.562
WALK OUT, BAILEY.

18:52.562 --> 18:54.364
NOW.

19:15.885 --> 19:17.257
(equipment clattering,
suction gurgling)
WOW, THERE IS BARELY
ANY NECROTIC TISSUE HERE.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.288
THE MAGGOTS MIGHT HAVE
ACTUALLY SAVED HER LIFE.

19:18.288 --> 19:19.829
WELL, REMIND ME
TO SEND THEM FLOWERS.

19:19.829 --> 19:21.731
WE MAY ACTUALLY MAKE
TRICK-OR-TREATING TONIGHT.

19:21.731 --> 19:24.794
YEAH, ABOUT THAT--I'M, UH...
I'M BOWING OUT TONIGHT.

19:24.794 --> 19:26.696
ARIZONA AND I CAN'T
BE IN THE SAME ROOM

19:26.696 --> 19:28.568
FOR MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES
BEFORE EVERYTHING DEVOLVES

19:28.568 --> 19:30.370
INTO GUNFIRE AND SCREAMING.

19:30.370 --> 19:31.871
SOFIA HAS BEEN SO EXCITED
ABOUT HALLOWEEN.

19:31.871 --> 19:34.474
I'M NOT ABOUT TO LET
HER MOMMIES' BICKERING RUIN IT.

19:34.474 --> 19:35.845
SO... TAKING ONE
FOR THE TEAM.

19:35.845 --> 19:39.679
ARE YOU SURE? (singsongy)
THERE'S GONNA BE A PIñATA...
SHUT UP.

19:39.679 --> 19:40.910
AND PIN THE HEAD
ON THE SKELETON.

19:40.910 --> 19:43.613
DAMN IT! THEY'RE SO CUTE
WHEN THEY'RE BLINDFOLDED.

19:43.613 --> 19:45.655
BOBBING FOR APPLES.
AW!

19:45.655 --> 19:48.618
(chuckles) THEY'RE EVEN
CUTER WHEN THEY BOB!
I'LL TAKE PICTURES.

19:48.618 --> 19:49.959
DR. GREY, IT'S DR. WEBBER.

19:49.959 --> 19:51.521
HE'S ASKING WHETHER YOU HAVE
ROOM ON YOUR SCHEDULE

19:51.521 --> 19:52.922
FOR A CYSTOGASTROSTOMY.

19:54.424 --> 19:55.765
MAYBE DEREK
CAN TAKE PICTURES.

19:57.527 --> 20:00.630
(mouth full)
DID YOU GET YOUR LABS BACK?

20:00.630 --> 20:01.801
NOPE.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.473
THE POST EXPOSURE COUNSELOR
GAVE ME

20:03.473 --> 20:05.775
THIS CHEERFUL LITTLE PAMPHLET
ON ANTI-VIRAL DRUGS

20:05.775 --> 20:08.508
TO READ WHILE I'M WAITING.

20:08.508 --> 20:09.809
SHE SAID IN CASE I DO
HAVE H.I.V.,

20:09.809 --> 20:12.812
IT MIGHT NOT BE A BAD IDEA
TO START TAKING THEM NOW.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.844
YOU PROBABLY
DON'T HAVE H.I.V.

20:14.844 --> 20:16.646
I MIGHT.

20:16.646 --> 20:18.688
I MIGHT NEVER SEE AGAIN.

20:18.688 --> 20:20.350
YOU PROBABLY WILL.
MY UNCLE CAN.

20:20.350 --> 20:22.522
YOU SAID
HE'S IN CONSTANT PAIN.
HORRIBLE PAIN.

20:22.522 --> 20:24.454
HE HAD TO GIVE UP
HIS ACCOUNTING PRACTICE.

20:24.454 --> 20:25.995
HE CAN'T DO MATH.

20:25.995 --> 20:29.799
I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO BE A SURGEON ANYMORE.

20:29.799 --> 20:30.930
(mouth full)
THE COUNSELOR SAID

20:30.930 --> 20:32.662
THERE ARE PLENTY OF OTHER
HEALTH CARE JOBS AVAILABLE

20:32.662 --> 20:33.633
APART FROM SURGERY.
(cell phone beeps)

20:33.633 --> 20:36.406
LIKE WHAT?

20:36.406 --> 20:39.369
LIKE POST-EXPOSURE
COUNSELING.

20:39.369 --> 20:41.571
BUT I WON'T KNOW
WHICH PAMPHLETS TO HAND OUT

20:41.571 --> 20:43.273
IF I CAN'T READ THEM.

20:45.275 --> 20:46.976
WE'RE SCREWED.

20:46.976 --> 20:48.378
(whispers) SO SCREWED.

20:48.378 --> 20:50.650
UGH! THAT'S ONE
JACKED UP CAROTID.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.722
YEAH, LET'S GO AHEAD
AND PREP THE SYNTHETIC GRAFT.
(woman) OKAY. STARTING IT NOW.

20:52.722 --> 20:54.654
(cell phone chimes)
IT'S YOURS, DR. AVERY...

20:54.654 --> 20:56.656
FROM DR. EDWARDS.

20:56.656 --> 20:59.559
SHE WANTS TO KNOW
IF YOU THINK SHE SHOULD

20:59.559 --> 21:02.562
CALL THE...
LASAGNA PLEASANT?

21:02.562 --> 21:03.863
THAT'S, LIKE,
HER 15th MISSPELLED TEXT.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.395
SHE'S SCARED.

21:05.395 --> 21:07.036
TELL HER NOT TO CALL,
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE,

21:07.036 --> 21:08.938
AND TO KEEP USING
HER EYEDROPS.

21:10.440 --> 21:11.941
YOU KNOW WHAT? AND TELL HER
THAT SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

21:11.941 --> 21:13.503
(suction gurgling)

21:13.503 --> 21:15.905
WHAT?
(scoffs) WHO ARE YOU?

21:15.905 --> 21:17.777
YOU WERE NEVER THAT NICE TO ME
WHEN I WOULD SPIN OUT.

21:17.777 --> 21:21.681
WELL, MAYBE... I AM TRYING
TO BE A BETTER BOYFRIEND NOW.

21:21.681 --> 21:22.782
NO, NO, IT HELPED
THAT YOU WERE AN ASS.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.314
IT MADE ME GET
MY ACT TOGETHER.

21:24.314 --> 21:25.715
I'M GETTIN' MARRIED,

21:25.715 --> 21:27.857
AND I'M SAVING
THIS GUY'S LIFE AND HIS FACE.

21:27.857 --> 21:29.559
AND THAT'S ALL BECAUSE OF ME.

21:29.559 --> 21:30.660
(scoffs)

21:30.660 --> 21:32.592
DAMN IT.

21:32.592 --> 21:34.293
I MEAN THIS WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE FUN, YOU KNOW?
YOU'RE OVERCOMPLICATING IT.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.665
JUST TELL
YOUR LEFT HAND TO DO

21:35.665 --> 21:37.026
WHAT YOUR RIGHT HAND
USUALLY DOES.

21:37.026 --> 21:38.898
HAVEN'T YOU PRACTICED
OPERATING WITH BOTH HANDS?

21:38.898 --> 21:40.730
YEAH.
UPSIDE DOWN, UNDERWATER--

21:40.730 --> 21:42.071
I-I PRA--
IN A STRAIGHTJACKET.

21:42.071 --> 21:44.574
YES, I HAVE PRACTICED
WITH BOTH HANDS,

21:44.574 --> 21:45.905
BUT I CAN'T JUST--
CUT.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.807
(instruments clank)
SEE?

21:47.807 --> 21:49.509
SIMPLE.

21:49.509 --> 21:50.840
I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T DO IT.

21:50.840 --> 21:52.682
MEREDITH, I JUST NEED YOU
TO OBSERVE WHILE A--

21:52.682 --> 21:54.784
I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE ASKING ME--
MEREDITH.

21:54.784 --> 21:57.487
PAGE THE GENERAL SURGEON
THAT'S ON CALL.

21:57.487 --> 21:59.749
I DON'T HAVE THE TIME.
I'M SORRY.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.824
I'M SORRY FOR SAYING
THAT YOU WERE THE WRONG CHOICE

22:04.824 --> 22:07.427
TO BE IN CHARGE
OF MY CARE,

22:07.427 --> 22:10.099
FOR SAYING THAT
YOU SHOULD HAVE LET ME DIE.

22:10.099 --> 22:13.863
(sighs)
I'M SORRY FOR EVER
FEELING THAT WAY.

22:13.863 --> 22:18.468
BECAUSE I'VE REMEMBERED
WHAT IT IS TO LIVE FOR.

22:18.468 --> 22:21.070
I WOULD HAVE NEVER GOTTEN HERE
IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR YOU.

22:22.842 --> 22:25.775
SO I'M SORRY.

22:25.775 --> 22:30.450
MEREDITH, PLEASE.
HELP ME TEACH THEM.

22:30.450 --> 22:32.552
(elevator bell dings
in distance)

22:32.552 --> 22:33.883
(scribbling)

22:33.883 --> 22:34.954
WHAT IS THAT, A FAN?

22:34.954 --> 22:38.388
YEAH, EXACTLY.
THE ARRAY IS A FAN.

22:38.388 --> 22:41.090
NOW IF I CAN GET THE FAN
TO GO IN THROUGH A BURR HOLE

22:41.090 --> 22:42.932
AND OPEN UP UNDER THE SKULL,

22:42.932 --> 22:44.063
THE WHOLE AREA
WOULD BE COVERED

22:44.063 --> 22:46.065
WITH A FRACTION
OF THE EXPOSURE.

22:46.065 --> 22:48.097
(chuckles) HOW HAS NO ONE
EVER THOUGHT OF THIS YET?

22:48.097 --> 22:49.969
HOW HAVE I NEVER
THOUGHT OF THIS YET?

22:49.969 --> 22:51.641
YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE REGRETTING

22:51.641 --> 22:53.072
STEPPING BACK FROM SURGERY
AT ALL.
IT'S ONLY BEEN A WEEK,

22:53.072 --> 22:54.474
BUT, UH, NO.

22:55.845 --> 22:57.607
WHAT'S THE RUSH?
I GOT THE KID'S C.T.

22:57.607 --> 22:59.849
YOU WANNA FILL ME IN?

22:59.849 --> 23:01.050
ADRENAL GLANDS ARE ENLARGED,

23:01.050 --> 23:02.682
COUPLED WITH HIGH POTASSIUM,
LOW GLUCOSE--

23:02.682 --> 23:03.983
ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY.

23:03.983 --> 23:05.655
HER BODY'S NOT PRODUCING
ENOUGH ADRENALINE?

23:05.655 --> 23:06.786
I'M GLAD YOU CAN READ.

23:06.786 --> 23:08.918
(pushes button)
BUT THERE'S NO TUMOR.

23:08.918 --> 23:10.520
UNLESS IT'S AN INFECTION,

23:10.520 --> 23:12.922
MAYBE BLASTOMYCOSIS.

23:12.922 --> 23:14.824
OH, GOD, HER--
HER DAD MENTIONED

23:14.824 --> 23:15.865
THAT THEY JUST WENT
TO BRAZIL.

23:15.865 --> 23:17.066
WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

23:17.066 --> 23:18.698
YOU DIDN'T THINK YOU SHOULD
PUT THAT IN HER CHART?

23:18.698 --> 23:20.430
(continues pushing button)
(sighs)

23:21.571 --> 23:23.603
(panting)
(sighs) WHAT THE HELL?

23:23.603 --> 23:24.804
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP,
AND I'M SORRY

23:24.804 --> 23:26.536
ABOUT THE LAST-MINUTE
CANCELLATION.

23:26.536 --> 23:27.537
WHERE IS SHE?

23:27.537 --> 23:29.038
SHE WAS JUST HERE.

23:29.038 --> 23:30.780
SHE WAS ASKING
ABOUT TRICK OR TREATING

23:30.780 --> 23:32.411
AROUND THE HOSPITAL,
AND I JUST STEPPED OUT

23:32.411 --> 23:34.744
TO CHANGE MY FLIGHT--
YOU COULDN'T KEEP AN EYE
ON HER FOR FIVE MINUTES?

23:34.744 --> 23:35.685
WHAT'S--WHAT'S GOING ON?

23:35.685 --> 23:37.617
TARYN'S BODY ISN'T
PRODUCING ADRENALINE.

23:37.617 --> 23:38.988
YOU KNOW
WHAT ADRENALINE DOES?

23:38.988 --> 23:40.890
IT KEEPS YOUR ORGANS FROM GOING
INTO SHOCK AND SHUTTING DOWN

23:40.890 --> 23:43.152
WHEN YOU GET HURT
OR TRAUMATIZED OR SCARED.

23:43.152 --> 23:44.994
YOU SAID THAT SHE STARTED
TO FEEL SICK LAST NIGHT

23:44.994 --> 23:46.796
WATCHING THE SCARY MOVIE?
SHE WANTED TO WATCH IT.

23:46.796 --> 23:48.798
SHE'S WANDERING THROUGH
THE HOSPITAL ON HALLOWEEN.

23:48.798 --> 23:50.099
LOOK, IF--
IF SOMETHING FRIGHTENS HER,

23:50.099 --> 23:51.160
SHE COULD GO INTO SHOCK.

23:51.160 --> 23:53.533
SHE CAN GET SCARED...
TO DEATH?

23:53.533 --> 23:55.164
(sighs)
WE GOTTA GO FIND HER.
(sighs)

23:56.636 --> 23:58.908
I'M LOOKING FOR
A CRAZY LADY WITH WEIRD EYES.

23:58.908 --> 24:01.911
TOO SOON, SHANE.
NO, SERIOUSLY,
SHE DISAPPEARED AGAIN.

24:01.911 --> 24:04.614
SHE WAS HEATHER'S PATIENT,
AND SHE WON'T TELL ME HER NAME.

24:04.614 --> 24:05.745
AND THERE'S NO RECORD
OF HER ANYWHERE.

24:05.745 --> 24:07.146
AND EVERY TIME I GO
TO FIND HER, SHE'S GONE.

24:07.146 --> 24:10.850
(voice trembling) WHOA...
WELL, MAYBE SHE'S A GHOST.

24:10.850 --> 24:13.152
FORGET IT.
(chuckles) STOP.
SHE'S PROBABLY A STRAY.

24:13.152 --> 24:14.654
HEATHER WAS ALWAYS
TAKING THEM IN--

24:14.654 --> 24:18.688
THE... THE HOMELESS,
THE UNINSURED.
(bumps door)

24:18.688 --> 24:20.790
(wheels rolling)
