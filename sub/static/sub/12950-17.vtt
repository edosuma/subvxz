00:04.871 --> 00:07.396
You're being
investigated by the DSR.

00:07.507 --> 00:10.237
They want to know why your
picture's in the Rambaldi book.

00:10.310 --> 00:12.144
They've decoded
some of the text.

00:12.145 --> 00:14.645
And?
What did it say?

00:14.647 --> 00:17.147
They're calling it
"The Prophecy. "

00:17.884 --> 00:18.550
Vaughn!

00:18.551 --> 00:21.179
Pursuant to national security
directive 81 A,

00:21.254 --> 00:23.422
you are in the custody
of the government.

00:23.423 --> 00:25.691
They broke the Rambaldi code
correctly.

00:25.692 --> 00:28.192
So what does the prophecy say?

00:28.194 --> 00:31.595
"This woman here depicted
will possess unseen marks,

00:31.664 --> 00:34.462
signs that she will be the one
to bring forth my works.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.735
Bind them with fury.

00:36.736 --> 00:39.728
A burning anger,
unless prevented.

00:39.806 --> 00:43.799
At vulgar cost, this woman
will render the greatest power

00:43.910 --> 00:46.410
unto utter desolation. "

02:36.089 --> 02:38.589
It's vanilla.

02:38.758 --> 02:40.425
Milk shake.

02:40.426 --> 02:42.926
Will you do me a favor?

02:43.296 --> 02:45.796
Will you remind them
that I cooperated?

02:45.865 --> 02:48.365
That I didn't resist?

02:49.569 --> 02:52.069
I don't need these restraints.

02:52.539 --> 02:55.039
I'll tell them.

03:07.720 --> 03:09.855
The DSR met with the FBI.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.356
The DSR didn't tell me anything.

03:11.357 --> 03:13.025
You're interagency liaison.

03:13.026 --> 03:17.326
Interagency liaison doesn't
put me in the inner circle.

03:18.698 --> 03:22.225
You and I don't work well
together historically.

03:22.302 --> 03:27.831
We've got this juvenile
animosity thing going,

03:27.941 --> 03:29.675
and that's got to change.

03:29.676 --> 03:31.677
Let's just start over.

03:31.678 --> 03:35.444
Hi. I don't know what they're
planning to do to Bristow.

03:35.515 --> 03:38.015
If I were you, I'd let it go.

03:42.622 --> 03:45.057
This buddy of mine at Princeton
knows Haladki.

03:45.058 --> 03:48.494
She used to see him eating lunch
at the Webster rotunda.

03:48.561 --> 03:51.997
That guy's got the table manners
of a 6-month-old.

03:54.534 --> 03:58.129
I'm gonna ask you a question.
I need you to be honest.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.738
Sure.

04:01.674 --> 04:05.337
Do you believe this thing,
this prophecy?

04:07.247 --> 04:09.114
You do, don't you?

04:09.115 --> 04:10.649
No.
No, it's ridiculous.

04:10.650 --> 04:13.018
But that picture
looks just like her.

04:13.019 --> 04:15.120
Sydney's gonna take down
the world?

04:15.121 --> 04:17.620
But the DNA sequence,
the heart size.

04:17.624 --> 04:19.725
They both match
what Rambaldi wrote.

04:19.726 --> 04:23.321
I mean, either this thing
is completely insane...

04:25.498 --> 04:26.965
Or it isn't.

04:26.966 --> 04:29.268
Okay, what happened?
The FBI's involved?

04:29.269 --> 04:30.302
Yeah.

04:30.303 --> 04:32.704
There's an FBI tribunal
flying in from D.C.

04:32.705 --> 04:34.640
They're gonna question her

04:34.641 --> 04:37.141
and decide
what the next move is.

04:41.514 --> 04:44.244
Ms. Bristow, I'm
Special Officer Kendall, FBI.

04:44.317 --> 04:46.551
Ms. Baker, Mr. Dunn.

04:46.552 --> 04:50.511
You're being held under
national security directive 81 A.

04:50.590 --> 04:52.658
Per the directive,
we can legally file

04:52.659 --> 04:55.560
formal charges against you
based on current evidence.

04:55.628 --> 04:59.291
We would appreciate cooperation
in answering questions.

04:59.365 --> 05:01.566
If you choose legal counsel,
this meeting is canceled.

05:01.567 --> 05:03.769
We'll determine the charges
based on current evidence.

05:03.770 --> 05:06.270
It's your decision.

05:06.572 --> 05:09.072
I have nothing to hide.

05:11.344 --> 05:13.345
Please state your name
and occupation.

05:13.346 --> 05:14.446
Sydney Bristow.

05:14.447 --> 05:17.211
I'm an intelligence officer for
the United States government.

05:17.283 --> 05:19.685
- Under which agency?
- CIA.

05:19.686 --> 05:21.687
How did you come
to work with the CIA?

05:21.688 --> 05:24.188
Don't you already
have a file on me?

05:24.190 --> 05:26.818
We would like this
in your words.

05:29.195 --> 05:31.196
I came to work with the CIA

05:31.197 --> 05:33.098
through my involvement
with SD-6.

05:33.099 --> 05:35.599
And how did you get involved
with SD-6?

05:37.203 --> 05:40.297
I was a student.
A freshman at college.

05:41.274 --> 05:43.041
One day, a man came to me.

05:43.042 --> 05:44.943
He said he worked
with U.S. Intelligence

05:44.944 --> 05:47.379
and that they wanted
to interview me.

05:47.380 --> 05:48.580
And you agreed.

05:48.581 --> 05:50.582
No.
No, not at first.

05:50.583 --> 05:53.211
It was the last thing
that I was interested in,

05:53.286 --> 05:55.554
working for the U.S. Government.

05:55.555 --> 05:58.456
Despite that,
I found myself wondering

05:58.524 --> 06:00.992
if I could actually
become a spy.

06:00.993 --> 06:02.494
You believed that you could?

06:02.495 --> 06:04.663
Sort of, which is crazy.

06:04.664 --> 06:10.432
I didn't even realize
what being a spy meant.

06:10.536 --> 06:12.170
The truth is,

06:12.171 --> 06:14.671
I didn't love any
of the subjects I was studying.

06:14.774 --> 06:17.709
My father and I weren't
speaking. My mother had died.

06:17.777 --> 06:21.008
The highlight of my social life
was my dorm's salad bar.

06:22.648 --> 06:24.416
So I called them.

06:24.417 --> 06:25.851
SD-6.

06:25.852 --> 06:27.486
They didn't use that name.

06:27.487 --> 06:29.755
These men led me
to believe they were CIA.

06:29.756 --> 06:32.623
They were very convincing...
are very convincing.

06:32.692 --> 06:36.651
So you met with an organization
that you believed was the CIA?

06:36.729 --> 06:38.230
Yes.

06:38.231 --> 06:41.098
They had me sign about 500
nondisclosure agreements,

06:41.167 --> 06:42.701
and they offered me a job.

06:42.702 --> 06:45.202
Just like that?

06:45.538 --> 06:47.973
They had me take a job
as an office assistant

06:47.974 --> 06:50.474
on the 20th floor of
a corporate bank downtown.

06:50.510 --> 06:52.210
I just assumed that the bank

06:52.211 --> 06:54.711
was somehow affiliated
with the CIA.

06:54.814 --> 06:56.948
They told me they
would be watching me.

06:56.949 --> 07:01.181
This was the evaluation phase.
That lasted for six months.

07:06.192 --> 07:07.392
The transition?

07:07.393 --> 07:12.330
Eight months of training, tests,
and propaganda.

07:13.132 --> 07:15.400
Before that,
I had never fired a gun.

07:15.401 --> 07:18.700
I had never thrown a punch.

07:18.805 --> 07:22.172
It was during the transition
I first heard the term SD-6.

07:22.241 --> 07:23.608
And at this time,

07:23.609 --> 07:26.339
you believed that SD-6
was affiliated with the CIA?

07:26.412 --> 07:29.210
Yes, that it was a black-ops
division of the CIA.

07:29.282 --> 07:31.782
Meaning...

07:32.351 --> 07:34.851
You mean, what is black ops?

07:38.224 --> 07:41.489
A division that is funded
by the CIA's black budget.

07:41.561 --> 07:43.528
Operations that
are highly classified.

07:43.529 --> 07:45.831
Even hidden from
congressional oversight.

07:45.832 --> 07:48.733
They led me to believe
SD-6 was one of these divisions

07:48.801 --> 07:50.869
and that was why they
didn't operate through Langley.

07:50.870 --> 07:53.370
You never questioned that logic?

07:53.773 --> 07:58.938
As I said before, Mr. Kendall,
they were very convincing.

07:59.011 --> 08:02.242
Now, I might not have been
a genius at 19 years old,

08:02.315 --> 08:05.375
but I was smart enough to know
what questions to ask.

08:05.451 --> 08:07.419
They had all the right answers.

08:07.420 --> 08:09.920
Says here you were a genius.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.827
And how did the transition end?

08:18.097 --> 08:20.657
They made reference
to the SD-6 headquarters.

08:20.733 --> 08:23.600
They told me
they'd take me there.

08:23.669 --> 08:26.104
What I didn't realize
was that getting there

08:26.105 --> 08:28.972
would only require
a ride in the elevator.

08:30.776 --> 08:33.211
The office of SD-6 is located

08:33.212 --> 08:36.544
on sublevel 6 of
the Credit Dauphine building.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.509
The first time
I walked through there,

09:03.576 --> 09:05.744
surrounded by strangers

09:05.745 --> 09:09.681
who I thought were working
for the good of the country,

09:09.749 --> 09:13.241
I felt wildly patriotic.

09:14.320 --> 09:16.555
And then I met Arvin Sloane.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.218
So you're Sydney Bristow.

09:19.292 --> 09:20.292
Yes, sir.

09:20.293 --> 09:23.785
Nice to meet you.
I'm Arvin Sloane.

09:23.863 --> 09:26.559
Welcome to SD-6.

09:35.374 --> 09:37.742
What happens if I need
to go to the bathroom?

09:37.743 --> 09:40.243
I think we can arrange that.

09:59.765 --> 10:00.865
Anything?

10:00.866 --> 10:04.199
My FBI contacts don't have
access to Sydney's case.

10:04.303 --> 10:05.437
What about Devlin?

10:05.438 --> 10:06.871
They're not giving him
clearance.

10:06.872 --> 10:09.372
All we know is that
Sydney's being held locally,

10:09.375 --> 10:11.343
and we've got to find out
where she is.

10:11.344 --> 10:14.677
It's how long she's in custody
that concerns me.

10:14.747 --> 10:17.682
Sloane wants a meeting
with Sydney Tuesday morning.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.884
Maybe the FBI
won't put as much credence

10:19.885 --> 10:21.686
in Rambaldi's prophecy as DSR.

10:21.687 --> 10:23.321
That's a miscalculation.

10:23.322 --> 10:26.086
In the current climate,
the FBI's being wildly vigilant.

10:26.158 --> 10:28.426
If another government agency
red-flags someone

10:28.427 --> 10:30.095
as a potential security threat,

10:30.096 --> 10:32.263
the FBI won't be so quick
to let them go.

10:32.264 --> 10:35.392
Sydney could be held long enough
to blow her cover at SD-6?

10:35.468 --> 10:37.702
Under directive 81 A,

10:37.703 --> 10:41.036
they could conceivably hold her
without trial or charges

10:41.107 --> 10:43.607
for the rest of her life.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.608
Describe your role
within SD-6.

11:16.676 --> 11:20.578
Desk work at first,
but I advanced quickly.

11:20.646 --> 11:23.877
The first year, I was being sent
out on reconnaissance missions.

11:23.949 --> 11:27.112
The whole time, believing that
you were working for the CIA?

11:28.688 --> 11:31.919
With the exception of a
half dozen high-level officers,

11:31.991 --> 11:35.791
the entire office believes
they work for the CIA.

11:36.696 --> 11:40.257
And you remained in school
during all of this. Why?

11:40.332 --> 11:42.067
Did SD-6 want you to?

11:42.068 --> 11:44.035
Actually,
they didn't want me to.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.970
It was something I wanted to do.

11:45.971 --> 11:47.772
Become a teacher.

11:47.773 --> 11:49.474
I didn't want to give that up.

11:49.475 --> 11:51.975
Who is Daniel Hecht?

11:57.183 --> 11:59.683
Danny was my fiancé.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.689
Could you tell us
what happened to him, please?

12:06.459 --> 12:08.526
<i># Build me up #</i>

12:08.527 --> 12:10.061
<i># Buttercup, baby #</i>

12:10.062 --> 12:12.030
<i># Then you bring me down #</i>

12:12.031 --> 12:15.125
<i># And mess me around,
and then, worst of all #</i>

12:15.234 --> 12:18.931
<i># You never call, baby,
when you say you will #</i>

12:19.038 --> 12:22.439
We had been together two years
when Danny proposed.

12:22.508 --> 12:25.909
<i># Don't break my heart #</i>

12:25.978 --> 12:29.744
I had never told anyone
about my involvement with SD-6.

12:31.717 --> 12:37.349
But I knew that if I was
gonna marry Danny...

12:37.423 --> 12:39.923
he had to know the truth.

12:41.827 --> 12:46.457
So I told him
that I was a spy.

12:48.634 --> 12:52.400
While I was in Taipei
on an operation,

12:52.505 --> 12:55.005
SD-6 had him killed.

13:05.484 --> 13:09.215
So, SD-6 murdered your fiancé?

13:09.288 --> 13:11.723
Yes, they did.

13:11.724 --> 13:14.159
And that didn't seem
extreme to you?

13:14.160 --> 13:16.094
I don't understand
your question.

13:16.095 --> 13:19.087
We're trying to determine how
a girl as brilliant as yourself

13:19.165 --> 13:21.895
could believe an agency that
could order the assassination

13:21.967 --> 13:23.034
of an innocent civilian

13:23.035 --> 13:26.198
could actually be affiliated
with the U.S. Government.

13:26.305 --> 13:29.570
You're suggesting that I knew
what SD-6 really was all along.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.338
You claim to have learned
the truth about SD-6 when?

13:32.411 --> 13:34.911
It wasn't a claim.
It was the truth.

13:41.787 --> 13:44.287
After Danny...

13:45.991 --> 13:50.826
I refused to return to SD-6,
which they saw as a betrayal.

13:50.896 --> 13:53.396
That's when they came after me.

13:56.535 --> 13:59.095
It was that night that I learned
that my father...

13:59.205 --> 14:04.336
who I was never
very close to...

14:04.410 --> 14:07.106
was also an officer with SD-6.

14:29.001 --> 14:31.501
Get in.

14:32.304 --> 14:33.771
Daddy?

14:33.772 --> 14:37.003
And I learned who I was
really working for.

14:37.076 --> 14:39.738
About a decade ago,
a pool of agents went freelance.

14:39.812 --> 14:41.546
The Alliance of 12.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.915
They're an enemy
of the United States.

14:43.916 --> 14:45.817
I'm one of them.

14:45.818 --> 14:48.412
SD-6 is not a black-ops
division of the CIA.

14:48.487 --> 14:51.650
SD-6 is a branch
of The Alliance.

14:51.724 --> 14:54.420
You work for the enemy
you thought you were fighting.

14:54.493 --> 14:55.994
That's impossible.

14:55.995 --> 14:59.624
That was the first time
I heard the truth about SD-6.

15:01.834 --> 15:04.334
The first time.

15:05.137 --> 15:07.438
Make sure Susan
gets Donaldson's briefing.

15:07.439 --> 15:10.203
Call Josh. Tell him I'm gonna
have to cancel lunch.

15:15.147 --> 15:17.348
What'd you say before
about Haladki?

15:17.349 --> 15:19.784
- I don't think he showers.
- About your friend.

15:19.785 --> 15:20.885
She used to see him at lunch.

15:20.886 --> 15:23.087
- At the Webster rotunda.
- Yeah.

15:23.088 --> 15:25.750
- At the Adams Federal Building?
- Yeah. Why?

15:25.824 --> 15:27.859
You're not allowed
in the rotunda

15:27.860 --> 15:30.360
unless you're
a ranking FBI officer.

15:31.730 --> 15:34.230
No way.

15:35.567 --> 15:37.402
Hey, you know what?
Excuse me.

15:37.403 --> 15:41.134
Before you joined the Agency,
you were with the Bureau.

15:41.240 --> 15:44.004
My history with the FBI
is right on my résumé.

15:44.076 --> 15:46.177
You know exactly
what FBI protocol is,

15:46.178 --> 15:48.874
and you know where
Sydney's being held.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.381
You have lost your mind.

15:50.382 --> 15:52.183
You're the one
on the witch hunt.

15:52.184 --> 15:53.918
Look, we decoded

15:53.919 --> 15:57.582
47 distinct and verifiable
Rambaldi predictions.

15:57.656 --> 15:59.457
The guy hasn't been wrong once.

15:59.458 --> 16:00.625
Where is she?

16:00.626 --> 16:02.660
What if he's not wrong
about this one?

16:02.661 --> 16:05.357
What if Sydney Bristow
is a threat?

16:05.431 --> 16:07.931
What if Rambaldi got it right?

16:09.501 --> 16:13.232
What did they tell you
was the objective of SD-6?

16:13.339 --> 16:15.640
The retrieval and study
of intelligence,

16:15.641 --> 16:18.405
both military and industrial,
throughout the world,

16:18.477 --> 16:20.411
that is critical
to the superiority

16:20.412 --> 16:23.870
and survival of
the United States of America.

16:23.949 --> 16:25.516
It's the company line.

16:25.517 --> 16:27.418
Well, what does
"SD" stand for?

16:27.419 --> 16:29.187
<i>Section Desparu.</i>

16:29.188 --> 16:31.055
The section that doesn't exist.

16:31.056 --> 16:33.616
Alain Christophe,
one of The Alliance founders.

16:33.692 --> 16:34.826
The term was his.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.128
Explain to us
about The Alliance of 12.

16:37.129 --> 16:39.263
The Alliance is like
a board of directors.

16:39.264 --> 16:40.898
Some are
from the private sector.

16:40.899 --> 16:44.062
Most are former intelligence
officers. All wealthy.

16:44.136 --> 16:45.903
They started a company together,

16:45.904 --> 16:48.839
except this company, The
Alliance, trades intelligence.

16:48.907 --> 16:50.508
So you're saying
they're after...

16:50.509 --> 16:53.009
Weapons, military secrets,
industrial intel,

16:53.045 --> 16:55.605
medical tech, computer advances,
political agendas.

16:55.681 --> 16:58.181
- Anything the other guy wants.
- The other guy being?

16:58.250 --> 17:02.084
Governments, corporations,
wealthy citizens, families.

17:02.154 --> 17:04.748
It's all black market.
It's organized crime.

17:04.823 --> 17:06.656
Could you give me an example?

17:06.657 --> 17:09.718
Do you remember the carbon proxy
disaster in '92?

17:09.795 --> 17:12.295
An accidental
methyl isocyanate leak

17:12.297 --> 17:15.232
at the manufacturing plant
in Bangalore, India.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.800
Killed 3,000 people.
Another 1,000 disabled.

17:17.869 --> 17:20.430
1996, near Kyoto, Japan.

17:20.539 --> 17:23.633
Bullet train accidentally
switched tracks and derailed.

17:23.742 --> 17:25.542
150 people were killed.

17:25.544 --> 17:27.578
Last year in Germany.

17:27.579 --> 17:29.714
A transport plane suffered
mechanical failure

17:29.715 --> 17:30.915
outside Munich.

17:30.916 --> 17:32.550
12 lives were lost.

17:32.551 --> 17:34.585
None of them were accidents.

17:34.586 --> 17:36.554
Some were acts of revenge.

17:36.555 --> 17:38.089
Others were personal favors

17:38.090 --> 17:40.458
to those who helped
to fund The Alliance.

17:40.459 --> 17:43.792
Some were distractions,
so local resources were occupied

17:43.862 --> 17:47.730
so that SD-4 or SD-7 could
infiltrate a building somewhere

17:47.800 --> 17:50.300
and retrieve sensitive data.

17:51.303 --> 17:53.803
Go on.

17:53.939 --> 17:59.434
After what they did to Danny,
what they tried to do to me,

17:59.545 --> 18:01.712
I swore I'd destroy them.

18:01.713 --> 18:04.307
SD-6.

18:04.383 --> 18:07.443
But first, I had to
win back their confidence,

18:07.519 --> 18:11.148
so I stole something that
I knew Arvin Sloane wanted.

18:11.223 --> 18:15.489
A device based on
the design by Milo Rambaldi.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.463
I'm back.

18:18.464 --> 18:19.797
Then I went to the people

18:19.798 --> 18:22.494
that I thought I'd been
working for all along.

18:22.568 --> 18:27.301
That's where I met
my handler, Michael Vaughn.

18:27.406 --> 18:30.705
I thought the job
would be over by Christmas.

18:30.776 --> 18:35.975
It was Vaughn
who made it clear to me

18:36.048 --> 18:38.548
what I was really up against.

18:40.352 --> 18:42.852
So that's how I became
a double agent.

18:44.256 --> 18:47.384
And a few days later,
your father came to see you

18:47.459 --> 18:49.594
and revealed that he
was a double agent

18:49.595 --> 18:50.928
working for the CIA.

18:50.929 --> 18:53.557
That his job at SD-6
was cover, too.

18:53.632 --> 18:54.832
Yes, that's right.

18:54.833 --> 18:57.333
Father and daughter
double agents.

18:59.204 --> 19:00.404
Yes.

19:00.405 --> 19:04.205
Why would he recruit his
daughter into that environment?

19:04.276 --> 19:05.610
He wouldn't.

19:05.611 --> 19:06.911
He didn't.

19:06.912 --> 19:09.710
Arvin Sloane was a friend
of my parents.

19:09.781 --> 19:12.281
It was Sloane's idea
to bring me in.

19:12.317 --> 19:14.817
He didn't tell my father
until after I was active.

19:14.887 --> 19:16.821
Why did Sloane go after you?

19:16.822 --> 19:19.023
I don't know.

19:19.024 --> 19:22.357
You're sure Sloane brought you
into SD-6, not your father?

19:23.729 --> 19:25.129
Why do you ask?

19:25.130 --> 19:28.861
Your father's allegiance has
always been with the CIA.

19:29.868 --> 19:32.462
Now, listen to me.
I have been very patient.

19:32.571 --> 19:35.096
I've put up with implications
that I'm not to be trusted.

19:35.207 --> 19:37.869
But I will not accept you
insulting my father.

19:37.976 --> 19:39.610
That is unacceptable.

19:39.611 --> 19:42.546
- It was just a question.
- It was an accusation.

19:42.614 --> 19:45.276
You are questioning my honor,
my loyalty.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.351
Based on a prophecy
written in a book

19:47.352 --> 19:49.852
that you wouldn't have
if it weren't for me.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.889
- I think we should take a break.
- I want to finish this.

19:51.890 --> 19:53.724
I want to get out of here.

19:53.725 --> 19:55.393
No, sit down!
Listen to me!

19:55.394 --> 19:57.695
I want to go home!

19:57.696 --> 20:00.460
Wait a minute!

20:07.539 --> 20:09.840
Okay, here we go.
Look at this.

20:09.841 --> 20:11.809
Rocking the cradle.
Yes.

20:11.810 --> 20:13.711
"Unless prevented
at vulgar cost,

20:13.712 --> 20:15.479
this woman will render
the greatest power

20:15.480 --> 20:17.215
unto utter desolation. "

20:17.216 --> 20:19.517
You gotta stop reading that.

20:19.518 --> 20:21.118
What's "vulgar cost"?

20:21.119 --> 20:22.420
Michael, I don't know.

20:22.421 --> 20:25.151
"This woman without pretense
will have had her effect,

20:25.224 --> 20:26.824
never having seen
the beauty of my sky

20:26.825 --> 20:28.259
behind Mt. Subasio.

20:28.260 --> 20:31.821
Perhaps a single glance
would have quelled her fire. "

20:31.897 --> 20:34.265
"Never having seen the beauty
of my sky behind Mt. Subasio. "

20:34.266 --> 20:36.200
That's where Rambaldi was born.

20:36.201 --> 20:39.500
Why don't we all go
to Mt. Subasio, huh?

20:39.605 --> 20:43.006
All right, here we go.
Around the world.

20:45.177 --> 20:47.677
What?
What just happened?

20:51.516 --> 20:52.717
Thanks for coming.

20:52.718 --> 20:55.915
I checked out Security Section.
They have nothing on Sydney.

20:55.988 --> 20:57.588
Look at this.

20:57.589 --> 20:59.657
"This woman
will have had her effect

20:59.658 --> 21:02.286
never having seen
the beauty of Mt. Subasio. "

21:02.361 --> 21:04.695
If the FBI is gonna take
this so literally,

21:04.696 --> 21:07.324
then every phrase
must have equal veracity.

21:07.399 --> 21:10.800
According to Rambaldi,
the subject of this prophecy

21:10.902 --> 21:13.070
will have never seen
Mt. Subasio.

21:13.071 --> 21:15.699
Meaning if Sydney were to go
there and see it...

21:15.807 --> 21:18.901
She couldn't be the woman
Rambaldi was talking about.

21:19.011 --> 21:20.978
It's good, it's good.

21:20.979 --> 21:23.607
Devlin put three calls
in to the FBI director.

21:23.682 --> 21:24.882
He was stonewalled.

21:24.883 --> 21:27.443
The FBI's not in the most
cooperative mood.

21:29.321 --> 21:33.485
We'll have to extract her.
Get her to Italy ourselves.

21:35.060 --> 21:37.361
I know Devlin
would sanction transit.

21:37.362 --> 21:38.462
We can have a jet in an hour.

21:38.463 --> 21:40.264
The question is how to find her.

21:40.265 --> 21:42.700
Steven Haladki.
He works in the L.A. Office.

21:42.701 --> 21:44.335
Former FBI.
He still has ties.

21:44.336 --> 21:46.836
Haladki.
I'll talk to him.

21:46.905 --> 21:49.040
He's not talking.

21:49.041 --> 21:51.541
He'll talk to me.

21:55.414 --> 21:59.976
When we left off, we were
chatting about your father.

22:00.018 --> 22:02.518
What can you tell me
about your mother?

22:06.658 --> 22:08.092
For most of my life,

22:08.093 --> 22:11.722
I thought that she was
a Literature professor at UCLA.

22:13.231 --> 22:15.731
I thought that she was
a loving mother

22:15.734 --> 22:18.498
and an adoring wife.

22:20.005 --> 22:22.803
Apparently, I couldn't
have been more wrong.

22:24.009 --> 22:26.509
Could you elaborate?

22:27.079 --> 22:29.946
A few months ago,
I noticed something unusual.

22:30.015 --> 22:32.813
I found Cyrillic codes

22:32.884 --> 22:36.376
in old books
that my father had purchased.

22:36.455 --> 22:38.155
I began to suspect him

22:38.156 --> 22:40.656
of having collaborated
with the KGB.

22:41.693 --> 22:44.287
But that wasn't the case,
was it?

22:46.098 --> 22:47.465
No.

22:47.466 --> 22:50.026
Those Cyrillic codes
you found in those books.

22:50.102 --> 22:53.265
Yes, they were orders
from the KGB.

22:53.372 --> 22:57.069
And, yes,
they were orders to kill.

22:58.143 --> 23:01.135
An agent received those orders
and carried them out.

23:01.213 --> 23:04.307
But, Sydney,
I was not that agent.

23:06.485 --> 23:08.985
Your mother was.

23:17.996 --> 23:20.496
Your mother was a traitor.

23:21.099 --> 23:22.366
Yes.

23:22.367 --> 23:26.167
A woman who appeared to be one
thing, but actually was another.

23:29.641 --> 23:32.141
Your mother.

23:36.581 --> 23:39.081
Tell me how she died.

23:42.254 --> 23:45.348
I...

23:45.424 --> 23:47.758
I used to think
my mother and father

23:47.759 --> 23:49.994
were driving together.

23:49.995 --> 23:53.726
I was wrong.
My mother was actually alone.

23:53.799 --> 23:56.100
She was being pursued

23:56.101 --> 23:59.161
by an FBI
counterintelligence officer.

23:59.271 --> 24:02.172
The roads were slippery.
There was an accident.

24:02.974 --> 24:05.474
The cars went into the river.

24:08.180 --> 24:11.377
After she died, your father
raised you. Is that right?

24:12.484 --> 24:14.385
No.

24:14.386 --> 24:15.586
He hired a nanny.

24:15.587 --> 24:17.087
Like I said,

24:17.088 --> 24:21.047
he and I didn't have much of
a relationship until recently.

24:22.694 --> 24:26.858
So, like your father,
you're a double agent.

24:26.932 --> 24:28.599
Tell us how that works.

24:28.600 --> 24:31.364
It always begins with
something that SD-6 wants.

24:31.470 --> 24:35.702
Information, technology,
classified data.

24:35.807 --> 24:38.640
Typically, Sloane outlines
the mission objective,

24:38.710 --> 24:40.444
then Marshall reviews the tech.

24:40.445 --> 24:41.779
Marshall?

24:41.780 --> 24:43.380
He's our tech guy.

24:43.381 --> 24:46.145
This looks like
just a normal phone.

24:46.218 --> 24:48.319
"Hi, I'm gonna be late
for dinner, Dad.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.488
Don't wait up for me. "

24:50.489 --> 24:52.756
Biometric sensor.
What it does is...

24:52.757 --> 24:55.749
Barely touch it,
and you are knocked out cold.

24:55.827 --> 24:58.796
Like freebasing Thorazine.
Boom, you're out.

24:58.864 --> 25:01.031
Now, this looks just like
a normal purse

25:01.032 --> 25:02.833
that you would wear
at the beach

25:02.834 --> 25:05.428
putting in your...

25:05.537 --> 25:09.064
but it is
a parabolic microphone.

25:09.174 --> 25:11.308
Not only do they
take pictures silently,

25:11.309 --> 25:14.437
but they're super-swank.

25:14.513 --> 25:17.311
Once I have the mission
laid out, I contact the CIA.

25:17.382 --> 25:21.443
I detail the SD-6 operation
on a brown paper bag

25:21.520 --> 25:24.785
and wait for the CIA
to contact me.

25:24.856 --> 25:28.257
After the CIA reviews
the mission, what happens then?

25:28.326 --> 25:30.561
I meet Vaughn
to get my countermission.

25:30.562 --> 25:33.554
And could you give us
an example of a countermission?

25:33.632 --> 25:36.692
SD-6 sends me to Moscow
to get computer disks.

25:36.768 --> 25:39.268
The CIA wants copies.

25:40.272 --> 25:41.438
I'm in the bar.

25:41.439 --> 25:43.939
I can see you.

25:44.509 --> 25:45.843
Are those the files?

25:45.844 --> 25:48.344
If they are, cough.

25:48.713 --> 25:51.213
Get ready to make a switch.

26:10.368 --> 26:14.134
After I get back to Los Angeles,
I have to complete a brush pass.

26:14.239 --> 26:16.173
I give the stolen disks
to Vaughn

26:16.174 --> 26:19.041
so that the CIA can make copies.

26:19.110 --> 26:22.773
Before I leave the airport,
Vaughn passes the originals back

26:22.847 --> 26:25.347
so I can deliver them
to Sloane...

26:26.251 --> 26:29.379
...all without
my SD-6 partner knowing.

26:29.454 --> 26:31.889
- Your SD-6 partner?
- Dixon.

26:31.890 --> 26:35.621
Dixon believes that SD-6
is affiliated with the CIA.

26:35.694 --> 26:37.528
He doesn't know you're a double?

26:37.529 --> 26:40.029
That's right.

26:40.765 --> 26:44.292
Does that ever cause problems?

26:48.740 --> 26:51.573
SD-6 sent us
to retrieve a vaccine

26:51.643 --> 26:55.511
from a plant in Badenweiler
and destroy the empty building.

26:58.883 --> 27:01.352
While I was in the laboratory,

27:01.353 --> 27:03.947
Dixon was setting
the explosive charge.

27:04.022 --> 27:07.185
What Dixon didn't know,
what I couldn't tell him,

27:07.258 --> 27:10.659
was that the CIA also had
a team in that building.

27:11.730 --> 27:13.864
I've got a bomb to disengage.

27:13.865 --> 27:16.365
We'd appreciate it.

27:20.572 --> 27:25.009
My CIA countermission
included disarming Dixon's bomb.

27:28.647 --> 27:31.147
- Did you get the inhalers?
- We're good.

27:32.017 --> 27:34.184
I knew Dixon's detonator
wouldn't work.

27:34.185 --> 27:36.685
That was the plan.

27:36.688 --> 27:39.156
Come on.
We gotta go.

27:39.157 --> 27:41.258
I brought a secondary detonator

27:41.259 --> 27:43.887
in case there was
a frequency jam.

27:55.840 --> 27:58.340
Let's go.

28:09.788 --> 28:13.656
Can we take a break, please?
Just for a minute?

28:25.970 --> 28:28.837
I have no desire to blow
your head off,

28:28.907 --> 28:32.308
but I will unless you tell me
where Sydney Bristow is.

28:32.377 --> 28:34.344
The federal building
on Moorpark.

28:34.345 --> 28:36.180
What's the plan?

28:36.181 --> 28:38.182
There's a safe house
half a mile away.

28:38.183 --> 28:41.243
- When are they transferring her?
- What time? 5:30.

28:41.319 --> 28:43.253
That was the plan.

28:43.254 --> 28:44.655
Just so we're clear.

28:44.656 --> 28:46.390
You report this conversation,

28:46.391 --> 28:48.891
and you'll never
wear a hat again.

28:50.095 --> 28:51.695
I got it.

28:51.696 --> 28:54.196
No worries.
I got it.

29:00.739 --> 29:03.239
We need a list of people

29:03.308 --> 29:05.542
who are aware
of your double-agent status.

29:05.543 --> 29:07.111
It's a short list.

29:07.112 --> 29:09.945
Besides the CIA,
only my father knows.

29:10.014 --> 29:12.514
You've never told anyone else?

29:12.550 --> 29:14.618
No. After what happened
to Danny,

29:14.619 --> 29:17.315
I thought it might be a good
idea to keep my mouth shut.

29:17.388 --> 29:20.824
I'm gonna call the bank.
I'm gonna quit for you.

29:20.892 --> 29:24.225
My job might seem pointless
and stupid, but it's not.

29:24.295 --> 29:27.025
And if you even knew
what I dealt with every day,

29:27.098 --> 29:29.794
you might thank me
for doing my job so well.

29:31.736 --> 29:34.236
What the hell
are you talking about?

29:38.243 --> 29:40.677
Nothing.

29:40.678 --> 29:41.979
I'm going to work.

29:41.980 --> 29:44.480
You have a hard time
keeping secrets?

29:44.549 --> 29:47.313
No, I don't have a hard time
keeping a secret.

29:47.385 --> 29:50.513
What I don't enjoy
is lying to my friends

29:50.588 --> 29:53.489
or being in a constant state
of jet lag

29:53.558 --> 29:55.225
from flying to far corners
of the world

29:55.226 --> 29:57.820
for a man that I wish were dead.

29:57.896 --> 29:59.129
Sloane.

29:59.130 --> 30:02.031
Yes, Sloane.

30:03.234 --> 30:05.828
How often does SD-6
send you on operations?

30:19.217 --> 30:22.380
<i># Tell me why
we're all gluttons for pain #</i>

30:22.453 --> 30:26.082
<i># The girl
is totally insane #</i>

30:26.157 --> 30:29.217
<i># She doesn't know
the meaning of tame #</i>

30:29.294 --> 30:32.786
<i># Still, I can't
put out the flame #</i>

30:33.965 --> 30:36.763
<i># Hey, hey, I wanna play #</i>

30:36.835 --> 30:39.804
<i># On the team
that you despise #</i>

30:39.871 --> 30:42.396
<i># Every day, a new disguise #</i>

30:43.541 --> 30:46.772
<i># Every night, a Halloween #</i>

30:46.845 --> 30:49.345
<i># She says,
"Keep the motor runnin', man" #</i>

30:49.347 --> 30:52.475
<i># Like I was some machine #</i>

30:52.550 --> 30:57.010
<i># And you can talk, talk,
but I'm keeping her stock #</i>

30:57.088 --> 30:59.648
<i># I wouldn't even
change a thing #</i>

30:59.724 --> 31:00.791
<i># Why fight? #</i>

31:00.792 --> 31:02.626
<i># You've got me
roped and tied #</i>

31:02.627 --> 31:06.723
<i># I hit your baited line,
I'm so diggin' your scene #</i>

31:06.798 --> 31:09.596
<i># I said
you're playin' with my head #</i>

31:09.667 --> 31:13.125
<i># I could split instead,
I'm so diggin' your scene #</i>

31:18.910 --> 31:21.410
I keep busy.

31:24.148 --> 31:27.879
What does SD-6 want?

31:27.952 --> 31:30.320
What is their priority?

31:30.321 --> 31:32.821
At the moment, it's Rambaldi.

31:32.891 --> 31:35.391
What can you tell me
about him?

31:36.728 --> 31:37.961
Milo Rambaldi

31:37.962 --> 31:41.523
was Pope Alexander VI's
chief architect.

31:41.599 --> 31:44.099
He was an artist and inventor.

31:45.203 --> 31:48.138
His designs were
so technologically advanced

31:48.206 --> 31:49.373
that, at the time,

31:49.374 --> 31:52.036
they thought he was a heretic,
and he was executed.

31:52.143 --> 31:57.547
Now, 500 years later,
many believe he was a prophet.

31:57.615 --> 32:01.244
And SD-6, CIA, GRU,
K- Directorate.

32:01.286 --> 32:04.881
The entire intelligence world
is on a Rambaldi scavenger hunt.

32:04.956 --> 32:05.989
Why?

32:05.990 --> 32:09.687
They assume that Rambaldi
had some sort of master plan,

32:09.761 --> 32:14.664
which was recently confirmed
following my trip to Argentina.

32:56.307 --> 32:57.574
In that book,

32:57.575 --> 33:00.408
Rambaldi refers
to a single construction.

33:01.879 --> 33:04.314
The agencies don't know
what it is yet,

33:04.315 --> 33:07.443
but they're all afraid the other
guy's gonna get it first.

33:10.355 --> 33:12.855
I just have one more question.

33:17.795 --> 33:20.355
Do you believe
Rambaldi was a prophet?

33:23.434 --> 33:25.934
Do you?

33:30.475 --> 33:32.975
You're not gonna
let me go, are you?

33:37.515 --> 33:40.015
We're done for today.

33:56.868 --> 33:59.368
Don't move! Get down!
Down! On the ground!

33:59.370 --> 34:01.870
Don't move!
You! Come with us!

34:04.175 --> 34:06.675
Go, go!

34:06.844 --> 34:09.344
Go, go!

34:11.049 --> 34:14.576
We've got a silver van,
California license plate 4...

34:18.188 --> 34:19.656
You're gonna be okay.

34:19.657 --> 34:21.324
What the hell are you doing?

34:21.324 --> 34:23.159
Proving this prophecy
is not about you.

34:23.161 --> 34:25.661
We'll explain
everything when we get there.

34:26.931 --> 34:29.431
- Dad?
- Hey, honey.

34:42.246 --> 34:44.614
If the FBI
takes this prophecy seriously,

34:44.614 --> 34:47.083
the key to your innocence
will be in the second paragraph.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.918
Rambaldi wrote that
the woman in that picture

34:48.920 --> 34:50.853
will have never seen
Mt. Subasio.

34:50.855 --> 34:53.847
The FBI would have kept you
in custody for months.

34:53.925 --> 34:56.917
SD-6 would have investigated
and found out the truth.

34:56.994 --> 35:00.020
Going to Mt. Subasio should give
them the proof they need.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.698
The FBI might have let me go.

35:01.699 --> 35:03.567
This makes them certain
I'm guilty.

35:03.568 --> 35:06.765
Escaping from federal custody
and crossing the border

35:06.871 --> 35:09.863
proves that I've acted in
opposition to the government.

35:09.974 --> 35:12.142
It was either do nothing
and get killed by SD-6

35:12.143 --> 35:13.810
or take a risk
to protect your cover.

35:13.811 --> 35:15.846
- I'm a fugitive from justice.
- Not for long.

35:15.847 --> 35:17.180
Once you get to Italy,

35:17.181 --> 35:19.911
we'll alert all agencies of
our actions and your location.

35:19.984 --> 35:22.119
They'll extract you, and
you'll no longer be a suspect.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.453
You don't know that.

35:23.454 --> 35:26.685
We will have protected
a vital CIA asset. You.

35:26.757 --> 35:29.257
FBI's not gonna want
to make a big deal out of this.

35:29.293 --> 35:30.794
They can't afford the press.

35:30.795 --> 35:34.094
I'm gonna take you to the jet.
You have to get in the trunk.

35:34.165 --> 35:37.566
What if the FBI was right?
What if Rambaldi was right?

35:37.635 --> 35:39.402
What if he was talking about me?

35:39.403 --> 35:41.171
Then everything's predetermined.

35:41.172 --> 35:43.106
Nothing we do makes
any difference.

35:43.107 --> 35:45.607
If Rambaldi's right,
there's nothing to lose.

35:45.610 --> 35:48.011
Seriously, guys,
cops are everywhere.

35:48.012 --> 35:49.479
When you get to Italy,
contact me.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.980
So we can speak.

35:55.720 --> 35:57.220
Alan, it's Steven.

35:57.221 --> 36:00.987
I need to tell you
something that happened today.

36:01.058 --> 36:02.893
No, I'm not okay, actually.

36:02.894 --> 36:04.294
I did a stupid thing,

36:04.295 --> 36:07.025
and I'll take
full responsibility for it.

36:07.098 --> 36:10.590
Jack Bristow came
to see me earlier.

36:10.668 --> 36:13.432
I told him about
Sydney's transfer time.

36:16.374 --> 36:18.874
When?

36:23.347 --> 36:25.847
Are you all right?

36:26.717 --> 36:30.050
You didn't think about it,
not once,

36:30.121 --> 36:33.488
the possibility that Rambaldi
could be right about me.

36:33.558 --> 36:35.025
No, I didn't.

36:35.026 --> 36:37.526
Why not?

36:37.862 --> 36:40.362
I believe in you.

36:40.431 --> 36:43.764
Did you think I'd just
throw anyone in my trunk?

36:43.834 --> 36:45.669
I just checked
with transportation.

36:45.670 --> 36:47.337
Four vehicles were taken out.

36:47.338 --> 36:49.898
I have their makes
and license plates.

36:56.414 --> 36:58.782
You're gonna take that car
to Dozer Field.

36:58.783 --> 37:01.017
There's a jet waiting
to take you to Italy.

37:01.018 --> 37:03.680
- Be careful.
- You too.

38:24.969 --> 38:27.270
The LAPD is in pursuit...

38:27.271 --> 38:29.831
Every day there's
another one of these.

38:29.940 --> 38:31.107
They're so stupid.

38:31.108 --> 38:33.109
Why doesn't
the guy just give up?

38:33.110 --> 38:36.079
- It's not like he can escape.
- He's stupid.

39:17.121 --> 39:19.255
Switch your engine off now!

39:19.256 --> 39:21.756
Look at that guy.

39:21.826 --> 39:26.263
This is the part where he gets
out of his car and surrenders.

39:26.330 --> 39:30.528
Turn off the engine and step
away from the vehicle now!

39:34.638 --> 39:36.806
Get your hands up!

39:36.807 --> 39:39.469
Get your hands
where we can see them!

40:16.580 --> 40:19.080
- Oh, my God.
- Wow.

42:35.319 --> 42:37.453
- Yeah.
- It's me.

42:37.454 --> 42:38.688
Sydney, where are you?

42:38.689 --> 42:41.189
I need to see you now.

42:57.775 --> 42:59.676
What happened to you?

42:59.677 --> 43:01.077
That plane is ready
to take you to Italy.

43:01.078 --> 43:02.912
- You need to go now.
- I know.

43:02.913 --> 43:05.413
But I needed
to see you first.

43:07.184 --> 43:10.210
Dad, I just drove a car
into the ocean.

43:10.287 --> 43:12.388
I knew the police
were waiting for me.

43:12.389 --> 43:14.090
I used the air from the tires.

43:14.091 --> 43:17.527
I was underwater for 10 minutes
before I started to swim.

43:17.595 --> 43:22.259
And as that car
started to fill with water,

43:22.333 --> 43:26.929
I knew what my mother had done
in the same situation.

43:27.037 --> 43:29.339
Dad, she could have
planned that accident.

43:29.340 --> 43:31.374
It makes sense.

43:31.375 --> 43:33.042
She was deceitful.

43:33.043 --> 43:36.012
She was cruel, ruthless.

43:36.113 --> 43:39.981
And in Rambaldi's prophecy
he uses details,

43:40.050 --> 43:43.281
like that DNA sequencing.

43:43.354 --> 43:45.288
Dad, I inherited that.

43:45.289 --> 43:47.814
I mean,
it's either Mom or me.

43:48.792 --> 43:51.352
I know it's not me.

43:58.402 --> 44:00.902
Mom's alive.

44:01.839 --> 44:04.339
I know it.
