- Take a look at this.

10:26.867 --> 10:28.951

Yeah.

10:32.122 --> 10:34.123

uh, metal detector over it?

10:34.216 --> 10:35.541
CHARLES:
I'm gonna do that now.

10:35.626 --> 10:37.126
Charles, I'll get you
some wood samples,

10:37.211 --> 10:39.387
- if you want to grab the bags.
- Yeah, I'll get it. Let me run

10:39.472 --> 10:40.388

CRAIG: Oh, there it
is, a piece of flat metal.

11:20.504 --> 11:21.680
CHARLES:
Yeah, it looks like it.

11:22.923 --> 11:24.516
There's metal right here.

- STEVE G.: That's good.
- TERRY: Wow.

11:28.938 --> 11:31.764
Hey, can you take a quick look
at this?

11:31.857 --> 11:34.600
Do you think that's mud caked
on there? Clay?

11:34.685 --> 11:37.270
Or do you think it might be
cement of some sort?

11:37.354 --> 11:38.697
Mm, actually, okay.

11:41.275 --> 11:43.609
Yeah, on closer inspection,

11:43.694 --> 11:45.111
yeah, that looks
like it might be

11:45.195 --> 11:47.205
a little more solid than mud.

11:47.289 --> 11:49.958
That looks like is has the
possibility of being cement.

<i>NARRATOR:
Possible cement?</i>

the cement for?

12:10.896 --> 12:12.555
What would they be cementing in?

12:12.639 --> 12:14.557
STEVE G.: What's the
history on that, Charles?

12:14.641 --> 12:18.644
In the vault that the Oak Island
Treasure Company found in 1897,

12:18.729 --> 12:21.656
they drilled through
what they believed to be cement.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.575
They actually sent a sample away
to London,

12:23.734 --> 12:25.401
and it came back
with a high probability

12:25.486 --> 12:28.571
that it was man-made cement.

12:28.664 --> 12:31.416
<i>NARRATOR: When treasure hunters
Frederick Blair and William Chappell</i>

12:31.575 --> 12:34.335
<i>reported drilling
through a cement substance</i>

12:34.495 --> 12:39.174
<i>that encased a seven-foot-tall
wooden vault back in 1897,</i>

12:39.258 --> 12:42.001
<i>they also discovered
the scrap of parchment paper</i>

12:42.085 --> 12:45.421
<i>bearing the letters V-I
as well as shavings of gold</i>

12:45.506 --> 12:48.257
<i>when they retracted
their drill bit.</i>

12:48.342 --> 12:50.927
CHARLES:
Don't break it.

12:51.011 --> 12:52.937
<i>NARRATOR: Since the team
has already obtained evidence</i>

12:53.096 --> 12:55.348
<i>of both silver and gold
in this area,</i>

12:55.432 --> 12:57.850
<i>could they be close
to finally locating</i>

12:57.935 --> 12:59.694
<i>the so-called "Chappell Vault"?</i>

12:59.779 --> 13:02.104
TERRY:
Interesting.

13:02.189 --> 13:04.699
<i>CHARLES: You know, the fact that
we're finding what could be cement</i>

13:04.858 --> 13:06.701
<i>on this piece of metal,</i>

13:06.786 --> 13:08.277
that brings me back to the story

13:08.370 --> 13:10.288
of the Oak Island
Treasure Company

13:10.372 --> 13:11.873
drilling into the vault.

13:11.957 --> 13:15.794
And they actually went through
cement and a very thin metal.

13:15.878 --> 13:18.379
<i>And that's maybe what we're
actually picking up now.</i>

13:18.464 --> 13:21.299
Yeah, this appears
just metal here.

13:21.383 --> 13:23.134
TERRY: It's a little
too thin for drill casing.

13:23.219 --> 13:24.877
I think so, too, yeah.

13:24.970 --> 13:27.213
<i>RICK: These are the first metals

13:27.297 --> 13:29.048
<i>of unknown origin</i>

13:32.061 --> 13:34.220

with drive shoes

13:34.304 --> 13:36.722
and old shafts and nails.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.058
This is a unique find

13:39.142 --> 13:41.569
at a depth we're
significantly interested in,

13:41.654 --> 13:44.823
in a previously unexplored area.

13:44.982 --> 13:46.816
<i>It means you're close
to a structure.</i>

13:46.900 --> 13:49.410
<i>That's my interpretation.</i>

13:49.495 --> 13:51.487
It would be interesting to see
if there is correlation

13:51.572 --> 13:53.331
or relation between the two.
I mean,

13:53.415 --> 13:55.583
- as we know, multiple workings underground.
- Absolutely.

13:55.742 --> 13:59.254
Dr. Brousseau can look at the
metal and see if it's cement.

13:59.413 --> 14:01.923
Okay, let's bag 'er.

14:02.007 --> 14:05.918

<i>on nearby Lot 17,</i>

14:31.612 --> 14:35.281
<i>which once belonged to the wheel
of an old cart or wagon.</i>

14:35.365 --> 14:37.283
<i>This find not only dated</i>

14:37.376 --> 14:41.287
<i>to before the discovery
of the Money Pit in 1795,</i>

14:41.371 --> 14:44.457
<i>but also offered evidence

<i>between the swamp
and the original treasure shaft.</i>

14:47.803 --> 14:51.631

to be true.</i>

14:59.481 --> 15:02.483
We put flags on any target

15:02.643 --> 15:04.068
that sounds good to me.

15:04.153 --> 15:06.562
- Mm-hmm.
- And now we've got permission to dig them up.

15:06.647 --> 15:08.656
So all we got to do is see
what they are,

15:08.741 --> 15:10.575
put them in a bag, mark them,

15:10.659 --> 15:13.903
exact same as the flag,
and Bob's your uncle.

- Okay.
- Find something good.

15:34.841 --> 15:37.352
<i>Rick, Marty,

<i>obtained permission from

in the public

16:26.485 --> 16:28.394
of how important this might be

has caused regulators

20:11.543 --> 20:13.544

Yeah.

21:11.428 --> 21:13.012

No. That amount is...

No, a thimble.
A thimble full of gold.

23:11.714 --> 23:14.475

Yes, it is.

23:33.078 --> 23:34.912
IAN:
So it's significant gold.

23:35.071 --> 23:37.322
It's either on the surface
of the metal,

23:37.416 --> 23:38.574
or it's on...

23:38.658 --> 23:41.660
the sediment on the metal,

23:41.744 --> 23:43.671
'cause it hasn't been cleaned.

23:43.755 --> 23:46.915
GARY: Does this, in your
opinion, make it more likely

23:47.000 --> 23:49.918
that there is treasure
in the Money Pit?

23:50.003 --> 23:54.515
Well, there's gold on the metal
at 88 to 92 feet,

23:54.674 --> 23:55.850
somewhere around there.

23:55.934 --> 23:58.269

23:59.855 --> 24:04.108
The water's another piece.
And these data are coming in.

24:04.267 --> 24:06.518
They're provocative

- Welcome to the island.
- Yeah.

RICK: It's just more homework,
more in-depth analysis,

24:21.793 --> 24:24.628
and I think in combination
with the water sampling,

24:24.713 --> 24:27.539
the lab work,

24:27.624 --> 24:30.634
as a team, we can move this
thing forward at this point.

29:53.708 --> 29:56.701
Or maybe there's
a specific forging technique.

29:56.786 --> 29:58.879
They are not just static finds.

29:58.963 --> 30:01.790
They should be able
to tell us something.

30:01.874 --> 30:04.960
One thing I've noticed
when we flagged this area,

30:05.044 --> 30:08.213
Peter and I,
is that most of the targets

30:08.306 --> 30:11.883
seem to be along the top here
and along the bottom.

30:11.976 --> 30:14.052
So the next group of targets
are down near the water.

30:14.136 --> 30:15.312
Okay.

30:23.488 --> 30:24.729

Look at the shape of that.

30:37.994 --> 30:40.420
Whoa, look at that!

30:40.505 --> 30:42.247
It's a round shot!

30:42.340 --> 30:44.424
RICK:
Wow.

30:44.584 --> 30:46.343
Dang, that is a nice find.

30:48.012 --> 30:50.764
<i>NARRATOR:
A piece of round shot?</i>

30:50.923 --> 30:55.185
<i>Although dating as far back
as the 12th century in China,</i>

30:55.344 --> 30:57.762
<i>round shot is
a spherical projectile</i>

30:57.847 --> 30:59.014
<i>designed to be launched</i>

30:59.098 --> 31:02.776
<i>from both cannons
and handheld firearms.</i>

31:02.861 --> 31:04.936
<i>While the early form
of round shot</i>

31:05.021 --> 31:07.272
<i>was made of stone,
it was eventually replaced</i>

31:07.365 --> 31:11.034
<i>by iron throughout Europe
in the 17th century.</i>

31:12.695 --> 31:14.705
Steve, look at this.

31:14.864 --> 31:15.956
Oh, wow.

31:16.040 --> 31:18.292
<i>Last year,
while sifting through the spoils</i>

31:18.376 --> 31:20.952
<i>excavated
from the Money Pit area,</i>

31:21.037 --> 31:23.380
<i>treasure hunter
Michael John discovered</i>

31:23.464 --> 31:26.884
<i>a very similar small,
round stone.</i>

31:26.968 --> 31:28.802
- Have you seen this, Gary?
- This...

31:28.887 --> 31:31.880
is a dress stone,
or a gun stone.

31:31.964 --> 31:34.892
This is really, really old.

31:34.976 --> 31:38.061
Before the days of cannonballs,
iron cannonballs.

31:39.639 --> 31:41.899
<i>Could this piece of stone shot,</i>

31:41.983 --> 31:44.484
<i>found between the swamp
and the Money Pit,</i>

31:44.644 --> 31:47.896
<i>and the one found last year
in the Money Pit area itself</i>

31:47.980 --> 31:49.406
<i>be connected?</i>

31:49.490 --> 31:53.076
This being stone shot, mate,
wonder where this came from.

31:53.161 --> 31:55.579
You'd have to say it came
from the water,

31:55.663 --> 31:57.998
- Yeah.
- Which is not too far away.

31:58.157 --> 32:02.002
And about the right distance if
you was firing a small cannon.

32:02.086 --> 32:04.087
So how big a cannon
does that come out of?

32:04.246 --> 32:06.164
It would... more than likely,
it would have been

32:06.257 --> 32:07.925
like a small rail gun,

32:08.009 --> 32:09.259
- Mm-hmm.
- That would have been attached

32:09.344 --> 32:11.261
to the side of the boat,

32:11.420 --> 32:15.766
and this would have been
an antipersonnel ammo.

32:15.850 --> 32:18.009
It would have been
like scattershot.

32:18.094 --> 32:19.603
It would be interesting

32:19.762 --> 32:21.104
just to bring, like,
a rototiller up here

32:21.189 --> 32:24.683
- and see if there's more of them.
- Yeah, we really should.

32:24.776 --> 32:26.935
I thought it was a bird's egg
when I first saw it.

32:27.028 --> 32:28.937
Well, that
just goes to show, mate,

32:29.030 --> 32:30.855
using your twin
optical scanners.

32:30.949 --> 32:32.366
RICK: Oh, yeah, it's
an amazing surface find.

32:32.450 --> 32:34.192
Rarely do we find those.

32:34.276 --> 32:36.954
GARY:
Oh, without a doubt.

Yeah, I'm glad to be back.

33:01.637 --> 33:03.304
Looking at this from afar,
and, you know,

33:03.389 --> 33:05.148
- Mm-hmm. Yep, yep.
- Punching in and punching out.

33:05.233 --> 33:06.483
What do you find
the most exciting?

33:06.567 --> 33:08.485
What is the things that
you're dying to show us

33:08.569 --> 33:11.312
and that, you know, I mean,
we can sink our teeth into?

33:11.397 --> 33:14.324
I might as well show it to you
right now.

33:14.409 --> 33:17.160
This is the most curious thing
of all.

33:19.664 --> 33:20.739
What is that?

33:20.823 --> 33:22.165
RICK:
That's one of the pieces

33:22.324 --> 33:26.911
of metal we retrieved
from D-2 up by C-1.

33:26.996 --> 33:28.830
There's a gold signature
on that.

33:28.914 --> 33:30.749
Really?

33:30.833 --> 33:33.251
Per the XRF?

33:33.344 --> 33:35.170
- Yep.
- This...

33:35.254 --> 33:37.431
is probably
the most exciting thing

33:37.515 --> 33:40.008
- Yeah.
- In terms of a treasure hunt.

33:40.101 --> 33:41.342
- Yes.
- Not the information hunt,

33:41.436 --> 33:43.094
- but the treasure hunt.
- Yes.

33:43.187 --> 33:45.430
- Yeah.
- RICK: The other curious thing about that

33:45.514 --> 33:48.933
is that it's right in the
horizon of one of the tunnels,

33:49.018 --> 33:52.279
- Mm-hmm.
- the 86 to 93 tunnels up around C-1.

33:52.363 --> 33:54.439
This was found at 88 and a half.

33:54.523 --> 33:56.608
And that's a much more
plausible depth than 220.

33:56.701 --> 33:57.942
MARTY:
Exactly.

33:58.027 --> 33:59.536
Exactly.

33:59.695 --> 34:01.371
Well, that kind of brings us
up to speed,

34:01.456 --> 34:04.365
but our first task here, though,
when we get there

34:04.459 --> 34:05.950
is to get in
the war room, right?

34:06.044 --> 34:09.129
'Cause Craig's here, and Craig
has some, to my understanding,

34:09.213 --> 34:11.289
more C-14 data, is that right?

34:11.373 --> 34:15.469
Yep, and I'm gathering that
it's gonna be very interesting.

34:15.553 --> 34:18.722
And it's in the D-2 borehole.

34:18.806 --> 34:20.223
Well, that's the same one.

34:20.382 --> 34:21.808
- The same one, yes.
- As this stuff.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.310
- With the gold.
- Yes. Yes.

34:23.469 --> 34:24.219
<i>MARTY:
All right.</i>

34:24.312 --> 34:25.804
<i>We had silver in the water,</i>

34:25.888 --> 34:27.731
<i>we had gold in the water,
now we're seeing gold</i>

34:27.890 --> 34:30.558
<i>on a piece of metal unearthed...</i>

34:30.651 --> 34:32.486
<i>in the Money Pit at a depth</i>

34:32.570 --> 34:34.321
<i>where an offset chamber
might lie.</i>

34:34.405 --> 34:36.064
<i>That is really encouraging.</i>

34:36.148 --> 34:38.241
<i>It's the first direct evidence</i>

34:38.326 --> 34:41.069
<i>that precious metals
might be here.</i>

34:41.153 --> 34:42.821
I'd say we're closing in
on the treasure.

34:42.905 --> 34:44.572

What the hell
you got here, Craig?

34:58.262 --> 35:01.005
- Samples.
- Do you got a bunch of new data for us?

35:01.099 --> 35:03.758
Uh, just one new data,
but I wanted to incorporate

35:03.843 --> 35:06.761
some of the old finds
we found in here, too.

35:06.846 --> 35:08.930
MARTY:
Okay.

35:09.014 --> 35:11.099
This is, uh, the other one,
this is from last year.

35:11.183 --> 35:14.686
This is CD-2.5,

35:14.779 --> 35:18.281
which is only a few feet away
from... from this one.

35:18.366 --> 35:21.785
And this is
from 91 and a half feet,

35:21.944 --> 35:23.954
so just, you know,
a foot and a half deeper.

35:24.038 --> 35:26.531
- Really?
- 1488 to 1650.

35:26.624 --> 35:28.449
Just one period.

35:28.534 --> 35:30.043
It's certainly...

35:30.128 --> 35:32.462
I mean, it's inarguable.

35:32.547 --> 35:34.047
We need to put a caisson
at this location.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.633
- GARY: Yep.
- CRAIG: And then,

35:36.717 --> 35:39.302
everybody knows D-2, kind of
an exciting well this year.

35:39.387 --> 35:42.046
We brought up
the pieces of metal,

35:42.140 --> 35:45.049
brought up wood
all around the 90-foot level.

35:45.134 --> 35:46.384
Wait a second,
you mean the piece of metal

35:46.468 --> 35:48.386
- with gold on it, that one?
- The piece of metal

35:48.470 --> 35:49.813
- with gold on it, exactly.
- Okay.

35:49.897 --> 35:50.981
Just wanted to be able
to say that.

35:51.065 --> 35:52.315
(laughter)

35:54.226 --> 35:55.643
CRAIG:
And, uh, so, you know,

35:55.728 --> 35:58.989
one thing we did was, we sent
the wood out for testing,

35:59.148 --> 36:02.242
and this is the sample
from 90-foot,

36:02.326 --> 36:06.321
and, uh, it came back
from Beta Analytical

36:06.405 --> 36:08.498
- with one time period.
- That's good.

36:08.583 --> 36:11.334
1488 to 1650.

36:11.419 --> 36:12.577

a little bit.

- MARTY: Yeah,

- Absolutely. - Right.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.841
These dates just support

37:42.001 --> 37:44.002
my belief for a long time

37:44.095 --> 37:46.754
that whatever work was done here
was done quite early.

38:11.789 --> 38:15.533
<i>the original treasure shaft?</i>

38:15.626 --> 38:18.211
So, it has always seemed
virtually impossible to me

38:18.296 --> 38:20.288
that after all the holes
we've put down

38:20.372 --> 38:22.299
in the conventional
Money Pit area,

38:22.458 --> 38:23.967
that this treasure
could still be hiding

38:24.126 --> 38:26.553
<i>in the conventional
Money Pit area.</i>

38:26.712 --> 38:29.797
This has 95.4% confident.

38:29.890 --> 38:32.892
<i>But I think
it's entirely more likely</i>

38:32.977 --> 38:34.469
that we've been looking
in the wrong place

38:34.562 --> 38:38.148
and that these new holes might
be where the real treasure is.

38:41.143 --> 38:45.146
To get those dates there, that's
pre-searcher by a long shot.

38:45.230 --> 38:47.815

could have been here first.

38:47.900 --> 38:48.900
Medieval, baby!

- There it is!
- I couldn't resist it.

38:51.737 --> 38:53.571

38:54.999 --> 38:58.835
What this does say, as
definitive as these results are,

38:58.919 --> 39:01.496
if you try to...

do a probability window, say,

39:04.166 --> 39:05.925

they all fit.

39:06.085 --> 39:08.503
They pretty much do.

39:08.596 --> 39:11.923
<i>RICK: There are various
theories that seem to indicate</i>

39:12.007 --> 39:16.436
possible evolving of
the Templars into Rosicrucians,

39:16.520 --> 39:18.596
into Free Masonry,

39:18.680 --> 39:21.516
<i>and there's
so much fractured history there</i>

39:21.600 --> 39:23.860
<i>that it's very difficult to say
with clarity,</i>

39:23.944 --> 39:28.272
<i>"This-- aha!-- this is what
happened in this time period."</i>

39:28.357 --> 39:32.110
<i>But there is no denying that
this story has persisted</i>

39:32.194 --> 39:35.622
<i>because of the belief
that there is treasure</i>

39:35.706 --> 39:37.624
buried on Oak Island.

39:37.708 --> 39:39.700
I mean, think about it, right?

39:39.785 --> 39:43.129
14 years in,
down the road of discovery here,

39:43.214 --> 39:46.874
we thought surely science
will carry the day,

39:46.959 --> 39:49.552
and now it
certainly has paid dividends,

39:49.637 --> 39:52.138
but we also thought that,
one by one,

39:52.223 --> 39:53.798
we could eliminate this theory

39:53.882 --> 39:55.800
and that theory and this theory

39:55.893 --> 39:58.553
and get down, narrow it down
to one, two or three.

39:58.646 --> 40:01.231
And yet,
five or six still remain,

40:01.390 --> 40:04.401
even with specific information
like this.

40:04.560 --> 40:06.811
MARTY:
Well, I think we can eliminate

40:06.904 --> 40:10.573
or just about eliminate
one of the theories, Rick.

40:10.658 --> 40:12.992
The, uh,
"nothing happened" theory.

40:13.077 --> 40:14.986
- That's pretty much dead.
- I'd say that's a...

40:15.079 --> 40:17.155
- It's pretty much dying fast.
- It's dead and buried.

40:17.248 --> 40:19.833
So, with that thought,
let's all get back out there

40:19.992 --> 40:22.669
- and do what we're doing.
- Yep.

40:22.753 --> 40:26.256
<i>NARRATOR: With every search
operation that they conduct,</i>

40:26.340 --> 40:29.250
<i>and with every new technology
that they apply,</i>

40:29.334 --> 40:32.262
<i>Rick, Marty,
Craig and their team</i>

40:32.346 --> 40:35.765
<i>are collecting more pieces
of the Oak Island puzzle.</i>

40:35.924 --> 40:39.427
<i>But as the picture
continues to take shape,</i>

40:39.511 --> 40:41.938
<i>will they ultimately identify
a masterful group</i>

40:42.022 --> 40:46.359
<i>of conspirators who hid
something of great value here?</i>

40:46.444 --> 40:51.022
<i>Or several of them, who,
connected by a secret agenda,</i>

40:51.106 --> 40:55.368
<i>made numerous deposits
over a number of generations?</i>

40:55.453 --> 40:58.204
<i>What is almost certain
is that treasure</i>

40:58.363 --> 41:01.866
<i>still lies buried on Oak Island.</i>

41:01.959 --> 41:04.452
<i>The question is,</i>

41:04.536 --> 41:09.299
<i>can anything stop the Laginas
and their team from finding it?</i>

41:09.383 --> 41:11.468
(wind whistling)

41:11.627 --> 41:14.137
Next time
on<i> The Curse of Oak Island...</i>

41:14.296 --> 41:15.221
<i>MARTY:
If there really is gold found</i>

41:15.306 --> 41:17.724
<i>on these pieces of metal,
this is</i>

41:17.883 --> 41:18.641
very, very significant.

41:18.726 --> 41:20.727
Wow, this is really interesting.

41:20.811 --> 41:22.979
So, we have
ancient Spanish gold.

41:23.063 --> 41:24.305
- That's huge.
<i>- So, when you project</i>

41:24.389 --> 41:25.982
this path,
it heads to the Money Pit.

41:26.141 --> 41:27.484
Wow!

41:27.568 --> 41:30.144
<i>LAIRD: Department of
Community, Culture and Heritage</i>

41:30.229 --> 41:32.071
asked that we stop down
immediately.

41:32.231 --> 41:34.157
<i>It is very discouraging to me.</i>

41:34.241 --> 41:37.818
<i>The more we cooperate,
the more of our island we lose.</i>

41:37.903 --> 41:39.662
<i>Fine, let's throw in the towel.</i>
