01:29.798 --> 01:31.507
Unbelievable, this guy.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.015
Hi.

01:39.850 --> 01:41.893
How's that seafood
tower treating you?

01:41.977 --> 01:45.646
Oh, delicioso, Ari.
You really outdid yourself this time.

01:45.731 --> 01:47.523
Seriously, I mean,
this dinner is even better

01:47.608 --> 01:49.066
than the one you took us
to when you signed Vince.

01:49.151 --> 01:51.944
E wasn't around for that one, you know?
He's making up for lost time

01:52.029 --> 01:53.738
ordering three different
types of caviar.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.990
Until I see your credit card you're still
a dine-and-dash candidate

01:56.074 --> 01:57.617
- as far as I'm concerned.
- Oh!

01:58.035 --> 02:00.036
Seriously, Ari,
the guys are right.

02:00.287 --> 02:02.163
You pulled out
all the stops. Thank you.

02:02.247 --> 02:04.540
ARl: Hey, Vinnie is officially
a superstar.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.209
Number one movie
in the country.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.294
Theme park ride.
Thank you!

02:08.377 --> 02:10.003
Cheers.
There you go, raise it up!

02:10.088 --> 02:11.380
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.217
Mmm. Ah.

02:14.802 --> 02:15.927
So tell us about
the ride, Ari.

02:16.011 --> 02:18.971
The Ride...
water theme, obviously.

02:19.056 --> 02:21.933
Studio is going nuts over it.
Did you see the commercial?

02:22.017 --> 02:24.143
- No. I don't really have to go, do I?
- You got to go.

02:24.228 --> 02:25.812
Head of the studio's going,
that means you're going.

02:25.896 --> 02:28.689
I'll go just to see you doing
Mach 10 in a water flume.

02:28.774 --> 02:31.234
- Yeah!
- ARl: No, I don't do thrill rides.

02:31.318 --> 02:32.944
Haven't since I rode one
of the partner's daughters

02:33.028 --> 02:34.779
in the William Morris
mail room in '86.

02:34.863 --> 02:37.448
You know what? You don't do
the ride, I don't do the park.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.661
Blockbuster clout has made
this boy shrewd. I like it.

02:41.745 --> 02:43.788
- Then another toast to that, huh?
- Yeah!

02:51.880 --> 02:53.464
So what are we
hitting next?

02:53.549 --> 02:56.008
Home. I need at least
45 minutes to digest.

02:56.093 --> 02:58.636
Yeah, unfortunately I got
to hurry home too, man. I'm sorry.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.180
- What's the problem?
- My daughter has a boy over.

03:01.265 --> 03:03.808
- Oh!
- A boy with Sarah, that's so cute!

03:03.892 --> 03:06.978
It's not cute.
You know who it is? It's Max Ballard.

03:07.062 --> 03:08.896
- The kid from "Young 21 Jump Street"?
- Yeah.

03:08.981 --> 03:10.940
- It's a good show.
- Didn't they ship him off to rehab

03:11.024 --> 03:13.693
- for Vicodin addiction?
- Hey, moron, he's 13.

03:13.777 --> 03:15.736
In celeb years that's like 30.

03:15.821 --> 03:18.114
So what's that make you,
Drama, like 140?

03:18.198 --> 03:20.741
So you're admitting
I'm a celeb.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.331
It's bullshit, Drama.

03:27.416 --> 03:31.127
Just 'cause the guy put the doggie bag
in front of you doesn't mean it's yours.

03:31.211 --> 03:34.130
You said it yourself, chief:
Possession is 9/10 of the law.

03:34.214 --> 03:37.466
And this glorious 32 oz. Porterhouse
is in my possession.

03:38.552 --> 03:40.219
- What's that?
- Get off it!

03:42.264 --> 03:44.432
- Damn.
- Too slow, Turtle.

03:44.516 --> 03:46.517
Which one of you barn animals
left the door open?

03:46.602 --> 03:48.311
Oh, that would be
the meat stealer.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.354
I don't think so.
I was first man out.

03:50.439 --> 03:53.524
You were, Johnny, until you ran back in
to splash some more Drakkar on...

03:55.819 --> 03:57.153
Arnold don't sound
too happy.

03:57.696 --> 04:00.281
- I'm going to call Westec.
- No forget it.

04:00.365 --> 04:02.742
Rent-a-cops move
slower than real ones.

04:02.826 --> 04:04.076
So you're just
going to go in?

04:05.412 --> 04:07.413
Life is for
the adventurous, E.

04:12.002 --> 04:14.086
Maybe we should leave
Vince in the car?

04:14.838 --> 04:17.048
If something happens
to him we're all fucked.

04:27.184 --> 04:29.143
Do you smell something?

04:30.187 --> 04:31.479
Is that sausage?

04:31.688 --> 04:33.981
No, that's gourmet kielbasa.

04:34.066 --> 04:36.025
It's been aging
for three days.

04:36.193 --> 04:38.194
I was going
to surprise you guys.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.321
I'll kill that son
of a bitch!

04:51.208 --> 04:53.501
Wait, wait, wait.
You go first, we'll come behind you.

04:53.585 --> 04:55.086
Why don't you go?

04:57.255 --> 04:59.590
I can hear you assholes.

04:59.716 --> 05:02.426
- Dom?
- Surprise, motherfuckers.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.304
- Yo, Dom!
- What's up, bro?

05:05.389 --> 05:06.973
Give me some love, man.

05:07.224 --> 05:09.016
I've been on a bus
for the last three days

05:09.101 --> 05:10.977
with your pretty fucking
picture on it, Vince.

05:11.061 --> 05:12.645
- Ironic, huh?
- Come here.

05:12.729 --> 05:15.022
Dom, you better learn
to knock, bro.

05:15.107 --> 05:16.941
You have no idea
how close you came...

05:17.025 --> 05:18.567
Close to what, Drama?
You need more muscle

05:18.694 --> 05:21.529
than you three fruitcakes
and Aquaman here to get me down.

05:21.738 --> 05:23.280
Hey, what did you
do to my dog?

05:23.365 --> 05:25.658
He's all right. He's in the john
eating a nice piece of meat.

05:25.742 --> 05:26.867
Not my lamb chops?

05:28.078 --> 05:29.328
Hey, Ebola

05:29.788 --> 05:32.081
What's with you infectious
fucking disease, you?

05:32.165 --> 05:34.542
You know I always hated
that name, Dom. How are you?

05:34.751 --> 05:36.419
Come on, huh?

05:36.795 --> 05:38.504
- How did you get out of prison?
- They let me out.

05:38.588 --> 05:40.381
Good behavior
of all things.

05:40.632 --> 05:42.633
Damn, you motherfuckers
look good.

05:43.468 --> 05:46.679
- It's been a long time. I missed you.
- Hey, we missed you too, man.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.639
We haven't all been together
since what, '98?

05:48.724 --> 05:50.516
- At least.
- This calls for a celebration.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.351
Yeah, I'll break out
the Lowenbrau.

05:52.436 --> 05:54.603
No, no, no. Take me out.
I've been surrounded

05:54.688 --> 05:56.605
by nothing but men
for the last five years.

05:56.690 --> 06:00.317
- Show me some L.A. Pussy.
- I think we can do that. Come on.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.654
You come back here!

06:04.114 --> 06:05.781
I hate you, I hate you,
I hate you!

06:06.450 --> 06:09.201
The director was really
up my ass during this scene.

06:09.286 --> 06:11.620
Don't you dare slam that door!

06:13.165 --> 06:14.957
I want to live with my father.

06:15.459 --> 06:16.709
It's 10:30,
get him out of here.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.335
He's a nice boy, Ari.
Just stop it.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.337
Nice boys don't have nine cars.

06:21.173 --> 06:22.965
- Shh.
- What?

06:23.050 --> 06:25.426
- You hear that?
- What?

06:27.262 --> 06:29.805
Silence.
They stopped talking.

06:30.307 --> 06:32.850
- I'm going in.
- Ari, Ar...

06:35.270 --> 06:38.230
Oh. Hey, baby.
I totally forgot you had company.

06:38.315 --> 06:40.316
- Hey, how's it going, Max?
- Hey, Mr. Gold.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.817
What are you guys doing?

06:42.069 --> 06:44.653
Max is showing me scenes
from his new movie.

06:44.821 --> 06:47.239
- It's so good.
- Oh, thanks, babe.

06:48.575 --> 06:49.742
All right.
It's time to go.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.494
- Daddy!
- No, no, no. It's 10:30, honey.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.079
It's way too late
for company, come on.

06:53.163 --> 06:55.206
It's cool, Sarah.
I'll just see you tomorrow.

06:55.290 --> 06:58.084
Actually you won't.
We're going to Six Flags tomorrow, so...

06:58.335 --> 06:59.585
Yeah, I know.
I'll be there too.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.213
Why... why will you
be there?

07:02.297 --> 07:03.756
Max is in talks
with the studio

07:03.840 --> 07:05.966
about taking over
the Cody Banks franchise.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.968
Plus my peeps think
it's a good press op.

07:08.053 --> 07:09.303
It's going to be
a zoo there, Max.

07:09.387 --> 07:12.515
You sure you want to be ripped limb
from limb by screaming fans?

07:12.682 --> 07:15.476
Are you kidding?
I love my fans. Later, dude.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.686
I'll IM you late night.
Ciao.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.688
ARl: I'll walk you out.

07:32.369 --> 07:33.577
In the joint

07:33.662 --> 07:36.622
the homos on my tier,
they have pictures of you on the wall.

07:36.998 --> 07:39.959
And I tell them I grew up with that little punk

07:40.043 --> 07:42.837
that you're whacking it to.
They didn't believe me though.

07:43.213 --> 07:45.631
So they didn't believe
you knew the Chase brothers, huh?

07:45.841 --> 07:47.842
Oh, they believe
I knew you, Drama.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.385
Why didn't you call me
when you got out?

07:49.469 --> 07:50.845
I would have sent you
a plane ticket.

07:50.929 --> 07:52.680
I had a lot of loose
ends to tie up.

07:52.764 --> 07:54.557
You know,
mostly parole board crap.

07:54.724 --> 07:56.767
They had to give me
permission just to come out.

07:56.852 --> 07:58.978
- Wow.
- Plus, I wanted to surprise you guys.

07:59.062 --> 08:00.604
Nothing like a good
breaking-and-entering

08:00.689 --> 08:03.232
to get the old heart
pumping, huh?

08:03.775 --> 08:06.402
- How'd you find the house?
- Star maps.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.362
How long are you planning
on staying for?

08:08.446 --> 08:10.239
What's with this guy?

08:10.323 --> 08:12.158
What is this,
a fucking interrogation?

08:12.242 --> 08:13.576
Yeah, E,
what's your problem?

08:13.660 --> 08:16.078
The guy just got here.
You're already asking when he's leaving?

08:16.163 --> 08:18.873
You stay as long as you want, Dom.
We got plenty of space.

08:18.957 --> 08:21.542
Thanks, Vince. It's nice to know
you're still there for me.

08:21.626 --> 08:23.460
You know,
it's been a rough road.

08:23.545 --> 08:25.921
You come out of the joint,
a lot of people

08:26.006 --> 08:28.340
who you thought
were your friends, they're not.

08:28.425 --> 08:30.926
I guess it's hard
to love a felon.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.636
Anyway, before I get
all misty like a queer,

08:33.722 --> 08:36.015
why don't you bums
hook me up with some easy ass?

08:36.099 --> 08:38.392
Come on, I'll take a lap with you.
Show you my skills.

08:38.934 --> 08:40.644
You can come too, Drama.

08:40.729 --> 08:42.730
Yeah, like I need an invitation.

08:45.901 --> 08:48.027
E., what are you being
a dick for, huh?

08:48.111 --> 08:50.529
I'm not being a dick.
I just don't trust him.

08:50.614 --> 08:52.198
You don't like
that he calls you E coli?

08:52.282 --> 08:54.617
It's Ebola, and no,
that's got nothing to do with it.

08:55.118 --> 08:57.828
It's Dom. We've known him
our whole lives. He's not a stranger.

08:57.913 --> 08:59.872
It's the fact that I know him
that worries me.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.541
The guy shows up one day
after we open up at number one.

09:02.918 --> 09:05.002
He wants something. Look at
all the guilt he's throwing your way.

09:05.086 --> 09:08.005
- Well, I do owe him.
- You're not the reason he went to jail.

09:08.089 --> 09:09.632
- It was my weed.
- It was two joints.

09:09.716 --> 09:12.134
The guy would have been out in a day
but he punched the cop in the face.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.637
He wouldn't have been near the cops
if it weren't for those two joints.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.639
He would've gotten locked up
for something else, you know that.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.140
I don't know that.

09:19.392 --> 09:22.269
I mean, it's simple. What are you
going to do when he fucks up out here?

09:22.354 --> 09:24.396
- If!
- Okay, if.

09:24.481 --> 09:27.524
Well, then I'll deal with it.
It'll be my problem not yours.

09:27.609 --> 09:29.193
- Okay?
- Okay.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.403
Don't worry so much, man.
We're number one, baby!

09:31.488 --> 09:34.240
Number one, baby.
Have fun.

09:36.368 --> 09:38.285
Fuck you!

09:47.754 --> 09:49.380
She's still online.

09:49.464 --> 09:52.007
So go tell her you secretly monitor
her buddy list.

09:52.175 --> 09:54.176
See how that affects
trust issues.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.971
Ari! Ari!

10:13.405 --> 10:14.780
Daddy, what are you doing?

10:14.864 --> 10:17.074
Shh, go back to sleep, baby.
My computer is on the fritz.

10:17.158 --> 10:20.286
I'll have this back
to you before the morning. I love you.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.584
All I said was that she had nice lips.

10:27.669 --> 10:30.170
Yeah, and that you wanted
to introduce them to your member.

10:30.255 --> 10:32.548
Where I come from that's
a fucking compliment.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.383
Hysterical, Dom.
Hysterical.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.218
Am I nuts, or does it feel
like we're back home?

10:36.303 --> 10:37.928
- Yeah.
- Awesome to have you here, Dom.

10:38.013 --> 10:39.722
Yeah, Dom.
Awesome, bro, awesome.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.390
I'll catch you guys later.
I'm gonna head up.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.642
Hold on a sec.
I got a little something for you.

10:45.562 --> 10:47.896
I know you're kind of
the de facto leader of this crew.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.399
So I want to give you this
as a show my appreciation

10:50.483 --> 10:52.484
for letting me come out.

10:54.904 --> 10:57.072
He gave you a present.
Be nice, huh?

10:57.157 --> 10:58.782
- What is it?
- It's a screenplay.

10:58.867 --> 11:02.202
I wrote it in the joint. It's about
the last seven years of my life.

11:02.662 --> 11:06.248
- You wrote it by hand?
- All 234 pages, my friend.

11:06.333 --> 11:09.001
And it's perfect...
perfect for your next movie, Vince.

11:09.085 --> 11:10.919
If there's anybody
that can play me,

11:11.004 --> 11:12.629
- it's you.
- Well, thank you.

11:12.714 --> 11:14.840
And don't worry about that script
making sense, 'cause it does.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.383
I read both of them
Syd Field books.

11:16.468 --> 11:18.427
He's going to read it
as soon as possible, right, E?

11:18.511 --> 11:20.220
- Oh yeah.
- Good, I appreciate it.

11:20.305 --> 11:23.349
And be real careful with it 'cause
it's not only my heart and soul,

11:23.433 --> 11:25.726
- it's my only copy.
- Have you ever heard of a Xerox, Dom?

11:25.810 --> 11:28.187
You ever heard
of not having no cash?

11:28.271 --> 11:31.398
Just don't smudge a lick or you may
see me get angry like in the old days.

11:31.483 --> 11:33.275
Yeah, E.
Don't make him mad.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.694
You remember how crazy
the Dominator gets.

11:35.779 --> 11:39.114
Dominator, that's good.
He'll get you.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.912
Oh, fuck me, you fucker!
Fuck me!

11:44.996 --> 11:47.247
Oh yeah,
you fuck me.

11:47.332 --> 11:49.875
Fuck me hard!
Oh yeah!

11:49.959 --> 11:52.044
Smack my ass!
Oh yeah!

11:52.128 --> 11:54.630
Oh, oh!
You like that?

11:54.714 --> 11:56.715
You like that?

11:56.925 --> 11:59.551
Oh! Oh!
Oh yeah.

11:59.636 --> 12:02.721
Oh, you like that?
Huh, you like that?

12:02.806 --> 12:05.474
Oh yeah!
Yeah yeah yeah yeah!

12:05.558 --> 12:08.477
Yeah! Oh! Oh!
Yeah yeah yeah!

12:08.561 --> 12:10.270
Yeah yeah yeah yeah!

12:10.355 --> 12:12.481
Oh oh!
Oh yeah!

12:12.690 --> 12:16.068
Oh yeah! Yeah!

12:16.152 --> 12:17.569
You hearing this guy, E?

12:17.654 --> 12:20.739
- People in Encino are hearing this guy.
- Hysterical.

12:20.824 --> 12:22.741
It's hysterical waking up
at 5:30 in the morning

12:22.826 --> 12:25.160
- thinking somebody's been murdered.
- Guy's been out of commission

12:25.245 --> 12:27.579
for five years.
He's just making up for lost time.

12:27.664 --> 12:29.081
Yeah! Yeah!

12:29.165 --> 12:31.667
Oh, yeah, oh.

12:32.419 --> 12:35.045
Oh, yeah.

12:35.130 --> 12:36.880
Oh.

12:40.301 --> 12:42.469
Couple minutes more and he would
have had my record beat.

12:42.554 --> 12:44.388
- Who's he got up there anyway?
- Don't get nervous,

12:44.472 --> 12:46.640
but I think it's one of those
Aileen Wuornos types he met

12:46.724 --> 12:49.685
- at an inter-prison mingler.
- Good one.

12:50.645 --> 12:52.938
- Morning, fellas.
- Oh, come on!

12:53.022 --> 12:54.606
- Jesus, Dom.
- Classic.

12:54.691 --> 12:56.150
Can't be bashful
in the big house.

12:56.234 --> 12:58.777
- We're not in the big house, Dom.
- You know, E,

12:58.862 --> 13:00.446
I don't remember you being so uptight.

13:00.530 --> 13:02.114
I'm not uptight.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.366
Maybe I'm confusing things.

13:04.659 --> 13:07.661
- Finish my script yet?
- I got it three hours ago, Dom.

13:07.745 --> 13:09.830
- A simple no would do.
- Okay, the answer is no.

13:09.914 --> 13:11.874
You see? Uptight.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.917
- See?
- Get on it, E.

13:14.002 --> 13:17.045
- There could be genius in those pages.
- Yeah, E, get to work.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.798
Hey Dom, you didn't happen
to write me in, did you?

13:19.883 --> 13:22.426
'Cause I'm a pretty prominent part
of the neighborhood.

13:22.552 --> 13:24.136
You'll be in
the sequel, Drama.

13:25.555 --> 13:27.764
- Hey.
- There you are, baby.

13:28.016 --> 13:29.725
How are ya?

13:29.809 --> 13:32.561
There's some Tropicana here
if you want to replenish those fluids.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.563
I got Gatorade
in the car.

13:34.898 --> 13:36.857
So is this really
where Aquaman lives?

13:36.941 --> 13:39.276
Yeah. And the front doors
are down the hall,

13:39.360 --> 13:41.528
so feel free
to kick yourself out.

13:43.114 --> 13:44.907
Good job.

13:44.991 --> 13:46.909
Gotta love
that "L.A. Express" paper.

13:47.202 --> 13:48.744
Even though that wasn't
the broad I ordered,

13:48.828 --> 13:51.205
she fucked
like a world champion.

13:52.248 --> 13:54.708
Uh, what are you doing
with my Le Creuset, bro?

13:54.792 --> 13:57.252
This? I'm going to use it
to cook you goofs some breakfast.

13:57.962 --> 14:00.088
That's not necessary, Dom.
I do the cooking around here.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.966
Giving us food poisoning
gives Drama a reason to live.

14:03.051 --> 14:05.177
Drama, I cooked
for 400 gorillas in the joint.

14:05.261 --> 14:07.346
You don't think I can handle
cooking for four jerk-offs

14:07.430 --> 14:09.431
in Beverly Hills?
Go sit down.

14:09.557 --> 14:11.266
You're a guest, Dom.
I insist.

14:11.935 --> 14:13.352
Drama, let go of the pan

14:13.436 --> 14:15.479
or I'm going to plant
it in your head.

14:15.563 --> 14:18.398
Hey, you guys are up early.
What's going on?

14:19.025 --> 14:21.443
- Dom offered to cook us breakfast.
- No, he insisted.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.362
Let him cook us breakfast, Johnny.
Take the day off.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.534
How do you like your eggs, Vin?

14:28.618 --> 14:31.328
Surprise me, Dom.
Do me a favor,

14:31.621 --> 14:33.872
- put on some underwear.
- Vince.

14:34.582 --> 14:35.624
Yeah.

14:36.668 --> 14:37.793
Never mind.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.050
Ari, you're acting insane.

14:45.134 --> 14:47.469
I'm acting... there's a movie star
that has his sights set

14:47.554 --> 14:50.055
on our baby girl,
and I'm acting insane.

14:50.390 --> 14:53.308
- He's 13.
- But in celeb years that's like 30.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.185
I'd like to see how
you're going to tell our daughter

14:55.270 --> 14:56.728
that she can't go
to the water park today.

14:56.813 --> 14:59.314
Tell her the ride didn't
pass inspection. That there's a drought

14:59.399 --> 15:01.483
and the entire park dried up.
I don't care.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.236
No no no, this is your thing.
You're going to tell her.

15:04.654 --> 15:07.281
- Tell her what?
- Oh, nothing. Nothing, baby, nothing.

15:07.365 --> 15:09.366
What time are we leaving
for the water park?

15:09.450 --> 15:11.493
- Max wants to know.
- Uh...

15:12.370 --> 15:13.829
baby, you know
that I love you right?

15:13.913 --> 15:15.747
- Of course.
- And you know that it's out of love

15:15.832 --> 15:19.251
when I tell you that I don't want
you coming to the water park today

15:19.460 --> 15:23.046
- or seeing Max anymore.
- Why not?

15:23.464 --> 15:26.216
Because he's an actor,
honey, and actors are bad.

15:26.301 --> 15:28.719
- But...
- I know this. I work with them all day.

15:28.803 --> 15:31.805
- Mom used to be an actor.
- And now she is not.

15:31.889 --> 15:34.182
- And that's why now she's good.
- Daddy, you're being unfair.

15:34.267 --> 15:37.436
I really like him. You can't
keep us apart for no reason.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.771
- I can certainly try.
- Mom!

15:39.981 --> 15:42.858
- I... your father...
- I hate you guys. I hate you!

15:43.860 --> 15:47.738
Oh, congratulations. You just
won yourself 50,000 in child therapy.

15:47.822 --> 15:50.866
Hey, in this town as long as I keep
her off an "E! True Hollywood Story"

15:50.950 --> 15:52.534
I've done my job.

15:53.119 --> 15:55.120
You just don't use
another man's deodorant.

15:55.204 --> 15:57.789
- Period.
- Come on, I used Vince's this morning.

15:57.874 --> 16:00.626
- Not a roll-on.
- Come on, Drama, I apologize.

16:00.710 --> 16:02.461
My mistake.
You gonna forgive me?

16:02.545 --> 16:04.880
Yeah, Drama, the guy apologized.
You gotta forgive him.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.883
- Why is everyone against me?
- Just get in the car.

16:10.928 --> 16:12.971
- What are you doing?
- I'm driving.

16:13.056 --> 16:15.307
- I do the driving around here, Dom.
- Really?

16:15.391 --> 16:17.351
How do you drive
with one arm?

16:17.435 --> 16:19.811
One arm?

16:19.896 --> 16:21.855
A dead arm like
in the old days.

16:21.939 --> 16:23.815
- That's going to leave a mark.
- Yeah, no shit.

16:23.900 --> 16:26.151
- Come on, don't cry. Hit me back.
- I don't want to hit you back.

16:26.235 --> 16:28.153
- Go ahead, hit him back.
- I just want to drive.

16:28.237 --> 16:30.864
When did you guys get
so territorial? "I do the cooking. "

16:30.948 --> 16:34.201
"I do the driving. "
We're neighborhood guys, we share.

16:34.285 --> 16:36.745
Have you gone Hollywood, pussies?
Come on, Turtle,

16:36.829 --> 16:39.331
I haven't been behind
the wheel of a car in a long time.

16:39.415 --> 16:41.500
Hey, Vinnie.
You know it's been five years

16:41.584 --> 16:44.211
since I've been behind
the wheel of a car? I miss it.

16:44.462 --> 16:47.756
Go ahead, drive.
Why, what's the big deal?

16:50.259 --> 16:52.344
Looks like I'm not
the only one laid off, bro.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.777
Five years of loyal service
and this is the thanks I get?

17:08.861 --> 17:11.029
- Quit whining, Turtle.
- Easy for you to say, E.

17:11.114 --> 17:13.198
You got a window seat
when I'm stuck sitting bitch.

17:13.281 --> 17:15.032
Turtle, you want to get
your elbow out of my spleen?

17:15.117 --> 17:17.160
You want to move over?
You fucking stink, Drama.

17:17.244 --> 17:19.746
That's 'cause I'm not wearing
any fucking deodorant.

17:20.915 --> 17:22.582
We need gas.

17:30.133 --> 17:32.300
- I want him out.
- So do I.

17:32.677 --> 17:34.553
- What do you want to do?
- I want you to tell him.

17:34.637 --> 17:37.639
- I want you to tell him.
- Fine, pussy, I'll tell him.

17:42.311 --> 17:43.812
What the fuck
are you two looking at?

17:43.980 --> 17:47.023
One lotto ticket too.

17:49.861 --> 17:51.862
I guess you'll tell him later.

17:56.659 --> 17:59.286
I'm just saying it's a big public event,
there's going to be a lot of press.

17:59.370 --> 18:00.787
You may want to tell
him how to behave.

18:00.872 --> 18:02.998
It's a water park, E.
What could he possibly do?

18:03.082 --> 18:05.500
- We've been to the water park with him.
- Oh, don't start.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.128
Senior trip, Six Flags. He almost
killed Ryan Drexler dunking him

18:08.212 --> 18:10.130
- in the tidal pool.
- He didn't know he had asthma.

18:10.214 --> 18:11.965
The kid had an inhaler
hanging around his neck.

18:12.049 --> 18:13.717
Jesus Christ.
Why do you always defend him?

18:13.801 --> 18:16.386
- Okay, I get it.
- Just talk to him, please.

18:16.846 --> 18:19.347
- Let's hit the fucking flume, boys.
- Let's do it.

18:20.808 --> 18:23.185
He stole that, by the way.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.520
What the fuck are you
whispering about, Drama?

18:25.605 --> 18:27.606
- Nothing, nothing.
- Good, then get the fuck in the car

18:27.690 --> 18:29.107
and let's hit it.

18:52.423 --> 18:54.132
Make some room.

19:01.265 --> 19:04.184
There he is. All right. You made it. E,
I hope you brought your lifts

19:04.268 --> 19:06.853
'cause I'd hate to see you sidelined
by the rides height requirement.

19:06.938 --> 19:08.855
That's funny, Ari. I'll be laughing
about that one on the ride

19:08.940 --> 19:10.482
when you're having a panic attack
and blowing chunks.

19:10.566 --> 19:14.027
Not if the minds behind Xanax have
anything to say about it, you won't.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.363
Another five minutes and I would
have cut the ribbon myself.

19:16.447 --> 19:17.989
- Sorry we're late, Shauna.
- That's my fault.

19:18.074 --> 19:19.616
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

19:19.700 --> 19:21.618
And is there a man behind
this beautiful belly?

19:21.702 --> 19:23.411
Is he kidding me?

19:23.496 --> 19:25.664
- Oh, you two are...
- Oh, please.

19:25.748 --> 19:28.041
Girls, this is my boy
from back home, Dom.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.293
Shauna, Christy.
This is Ari.

19:30.586 --> 19:32.587
Hey, you girls gonna ride with us?

19:32.672 --> 19:35.215
If I wanted to induce, Drama,
I'd be at the hospital.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.259
If you change your mind,
you can sit next to me.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.469
I always wanted to be involved
in the birthing process.

19:39.554 --> 19:41.388
That's disgusting.

19:41.472 --> 19:43.682
That's all right, you sit
next to me I'll take care of you.

19:43.766 --> 19:45.058
Even more disgusting.

19:45.142 --> 19:47.936
Vince, over here.
- Back off.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.813
- What are you doing, jerk-off?
- Hey!

19:49.897 --> 19:52.691
- Dom, stop!
- Jesus Christ!

19:52.775 --> 19:54.526
- He stole that candy bar too.
- What?

19:54.610 --> 19:57.487
Yeah, it's okay.
Give him back his camera. Sorry.

19:57.572 --> 20:00.866
- Thanks, Vince.
- Here, come here. Come here.

20:00.950 --> 20:03.660
Take the picture,
take the picture.

20:03.744 --> 20:04.953
Sorry about that, all right?

20:05.830 --> 20:08.582
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right. It's okay.

20:08.666 --> 20:10.917
Come on, let's go.
We got things to do.

20:11.002 --> 20:13.753
- Is he kidding me?
- I'll talk to him. I'll talk to him.

20:31.188 --> 20:33.523
On behalf of your friends
at Magic Mountain,

20:33.608 --> 20:36.067
we'd like to present you
with this key to our park.

20:36.152 --> 20:38.403
To Aquaman,
Vincent Chase.

20:39.989 --> 20:41.907
Vinnie!

20:43.284 --> 20:46.328
- We got to talk.
- So talk.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.540
It's a family matter, E.

20:50.625 --> 20:52.208
Yeah, it's not
for inquiring minds.

20:52.293 --> 20:55.295
I'm sure whatever you have to say
is really intriguing, Turtle.

20:55.379 --> 20:57.464
I'll be right back.

21:01.010 --> 21:03.428
I actually got some family business
to take care of myself.

21:03.512 --> 21:06.014
Oh, oh, I'm going to miss
all the excitement, Ari.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.350
You know what, Shauna? I'd work
on that attitude. For the kid's sake.

21:08.809 --> 21:10.977
- So what's up?
- We took a vote.

21:11.062 --> 21:13.188
- The two of you?
- That's right.

21:13.314 --> 21:15.023
The tribe has spoken.

21:15.107 --> 21:17.400
We think it's time for Dom
to push off our island.

21:17.485 --> 21:19.861
Really? I thought it was
awesome having him around.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.571
I haven't seen you two
this happy since we got Arnold.

21:21.656 --> 21:23.573
Yeah, well,
things have changed.

21:23.658 --> 21:27.202
Five just don't work, E.
Four is a perfect number.

21:27.703 --> 21:29.913
By the way,
he stole that candy bar.

21:29.997 --> 21:32.082
- What?
- Ask Turtle.

21:32.583 --> 21:35.418
I ain't a rat, all right? We just
don't want him around no more.

21:35.503 --> 21:37.879
- Unfortunately Vince does.
- So what, we gonna get a minivan?

21:37.964 --> 21:40.423
Look, the guy's on parole.
He's gonna have to go back eventually.

21:40.508 --> 21:41.800
We just got to ride
it out until he does.

21:42.510 --> 21:44.594
This one is going
to blow your mind.

21:44.679 --> 21:48.264
It is crazy. I don't know
about you, but I'm super excited.

21:48.349 --> 21:49.849
I hope you enjoy the ride.

21:51.602 --> 21:55.230
Come on, give it up for Vince!
Make some fucking noise.

21:57.191 --> 21:59.234
Yo, Vince.
Come here.

22:04.115 --> 22:06.324
Excuse Max, honey,
it's time for his Accutane.

22:06.409 --> 22:08.952
- What are you doing, Gold?
- Are you two-timing my daughter?

22:09.036 --> 22:11.621
What? No.
Me and Sarah aren't exclusive.

22:12.999 --> 22:15.041
I'd prefer if you were
nothing at all.

22:15.126 --> 22:16.626
Stay away
from my daughter.

22:16.711 --> 22:19.504
- Keep dreaming.
- Maxie, listen to me

22:19.588 --> 22:21.798
or I will squash you, okay?

22:21.882 --> 22:25.176
How are you going to do that, huh, Gold?
With you and your five-man agency?

22:25.261 --> 22:26.428
Don't make threats
you can't keep.

22:28.431 --> 22:31.016
Come on, Ari.
Flume of Doom awaits, baby.

22:31.100 --> 22:34.019
It's hell, Ari, seriously.
Take this just in case.

22:42.987 --> 22:45.780
Wow. So what's the rule
on these things?

22:45.865 --> 22:47.615
The slower the rise
the quicker the fall?

22:47.700 --> 22:48.867
Yeah, something
like that!

22:51.746 --> 22:53.288
This is sick!

22:53.622 --> 22:56.249
I guess I shouldn't have had
that second chili dog.

23:03.591 --> 23:06.801
- Jesus.
- You okay there, Ari?

23:06.886 --> 23:09.345
Yeah.
Just great, Dom.

23:09.847 --> 23:12.849
So what kind of fruit
name is Ari anyway?

23:16.353 --> 23:18.730
I spoke to Drama
and Turtle about Dom.

23:18.814 --> 23:20.565
Apparently I'm not the only one
worried about the guy.

23:20.649 --> 23:23.485
- I talked to him, E.
- Yeah? What did he say?

23:23.569 --> 23:25.403
It's all good.
He totally gets it.

23:25.654 --> 23:28.740
Great. So what's the deal
with parolees anyway?

23:28.824 --> 23:32.035
- How long can they stay out?
- As long as he wants if he gets a job.

23:32.119 --> 23:33.661
Good thing
he doesn't have one.

23:33.746 --> 23:36.122
Actually, I'm making
him head of my security.

23:39.001 --> 23:41.211
I owe him, E.
I owe him.

23:52.640 --> 23:54.933
Yeah, motherfucker!
