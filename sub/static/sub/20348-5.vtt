WEBVTT

05:26.619 --> 05:29.414
- Reverend.
- I brought a casserole.

05:29.872 --> 05:30.915
<i>...islands in the Pacific.</i>

05:31.082 --> 05:34.752
<i>And early reports confirm
it was uninhabited.</i>

05:36.212 --> 05:39.090
<i>The French government is denying any
responsibility, and details surrounding...</i>

05:39.257 --> 05:41.217
<i>God bless you, Reverend.
Thank you.</i>

05:41.426 --> 05:43.052
<i>...the person or persons
responsible for the launch</i>

05:43.219 --> 05:46.097
<i>are not being made available
to the international community</i>

05:46.389 --> 05:48.266
<i>despite overwhelming pressure for answers.</i>

05:48.725 --> 05:50.601
<i>- How is she?
- Still fighting.</i>

05:52.687 --> 05:54.355
We've all been praying for her.

05:55.648 --> 05:56.899
Thank you.

06:00.319 --> 06:03.156
Arturo, I need you to fly me to Australia.

06:05.283 --> 06:06.325
What?

06:06.743 --> 06:09.579
A cargo plane with the donated food
for El Salvador

06:09.746 --> 06:13.207
is sitting on the tarmac in Austin,
fueled up and ready to go.

06:14.042 --> 06:18.171
I need to get to Melbourne immediately.
I'm asking you to fly me there.

06:19.756 --> 06:21.132
But the explosion.

06:22.133 --> 06:23.468
They said all flights have been grounded.

06:23.634 --> 06:26.971
All nonessential flights.
Military and foreign aid are exempted.

06:27.138 --> 06:31.184
And you, Arturo, are not only
a valued member of our congregation,

06:31.392 --> 06:34.479
but licensed
by an internationally recognized NGO.

06:35.146 --> 06:37.106
Randy's available to copilot.

06:38.274 --> 06:39.650
Reverend, I...

06:40.109 --> 06:41.527
I can't leave my mother.

06:47.742 --> 06:48.993
That's $20,000.

06:49.744 --> 06:52.163
It should be more than enough
to compensate you for your time

06:52.330 --> 06:54.082
and get excellent care for your mother.

06:55.500 --> 06:58.336
Something incredible is gonna happen
in the next few days

06:58.878 --> 07:02.673
on the seven year anniversary,
but only if we go now, right now.

07:03.132 --> 07:06.677
You said that we needed to be
in Miracle on the 14th.

07:06.844 --> 07:08.679
We will be. We'll be back.

07:09.597 --> 07:13.810
But there's a man, a very special man,
and he's supposed to be here with us,

07:14.143 --> 07:17.105
but he's in Melbourne.
And because of this unexpected event,

07:17.522 --> 07:19.899
he's stuck in Australia. He's stranded.

07:21.317 --> 07:25.071
God has placed an obstacle in our way,
but He wants us to overcome it.

07:26.114 --> 07:28.241
He wants us to demonstrate our faith.

07:29.659 --> 07:32.036
We need to go get this man
and bring him home.

07:33.871 --> 07:37.208
- So it's a rescue mission?
- Yes, a rescue mission, exactly.

07:45.508 --> 07:47.718
Okay. Okay.

07:48.803 --> 07:50.012
Bless you.

07:52.807 --> 07:53.891
All right, let's go.

07:54.058 --> 07:56.060
I have some friends
meeting us on the tarmac.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.271
- How many?
- Just the three of us.

07:59.564 --> 08:01.149
Three wise men.

08:04.777 --> 08:07.113
<i>Hi, this is Kevin Garvey. Leave a message.</i>

08:07.613 --> 08:08.906
Hello. It's me again.

08:09.240 --> 08:11.033
I... I don't know
if you're getting my messages,

08:11.200 --> 08:15.413
but I'm sure you're aware there's been
a nuclear incident in the South Pacific,

08:15.580 --> 08:19.333
but I've secured transportation.

08:20.585 --> 08:22.420
I'm coming to get you, Kevin.

08:36.517 --> 08:37.768
What are you doing here?

08:39.228 --> 08:40.479
I'm getting on your plane.

08:42.899 --> 08:44.150
You invited her?

08:44.609 --> 08:47.695
The only reason you even know
where Kevin is, is because he called me.

08:47.862 --> 08:49.822
And we're immensely grateful
for that, Laurie.

08:49.989 --> 08:53.075
- Oh, you're immensely grateful?
- Yes. But with all due respect,

08:53.242 --> 08:57.205
I'm not sure you entirely grasp
what's happening here.

08:58.789 --> 09:00.791
Okay, three years ago,

09:01.000 --> 09:04.253
my ex-husband experienced severe delusions
and tried to kill himself.

09:04.420 --> 09:06.547
And instead of acknowledging
his mental illness,

09:06.839 --> 09:09.008
you turned it into fucking scripture.

09:09.300 --> 09:10.384
<i>And when he found out about it,</i>

09:10.551 --> 09:12.345
he relapsed
and ran halfway around the world,

09:12.511 --> 09:13.846
probably to get the fuck away from you.

09:14.013 --> 09:17.475
Is that what's happening here?
Am I grasping it, Matt?

09:19.143 --> 09:20.645
<i>Have you even talked to Kevin?</i>

09:21.312 --> 09:24.023
I left him a few messages.
He hasn't called me back yet.

09:24.982 --> 09:26.192
What about Nora?

09:26.817 --> 09:27.944
Nora?

09:28.277 --> 09:31.489
Nora, your sister.

09:32.490 --> 09:35.534
Yeah, she's not picking up the phone
either. But why would you know that?

09:35.701 --> 09:39.288
Because you're too busy
chartering cargo planes to Australia.

09:39.538 --> 09:41.832
Tell me, Matt,
does that seem reasonable to you?

09:41.999 --> 09:44.961
Well, it must seem reasonable to you
since you're trying to get on it.

09:45.211 --> 09:47.922
This is your fault,
you self-righteous shit!

09:48.089 --> 09:49.715
Yeah, did you bring your whistle, Laurie,

09:49.882 --> 09:52.093
'cause it sounds like
you need to blow off a little...

09:52.260 --> 09:54.845
- Fuck you!
- Everybody calm down.

09:56.389 --> 09:57.723
Look, this is my wife.

09:58.975 --> 10:00.685
You want us to come, she comes, too.

10:02.103 --> 10:03.521
We all want the same thing.

10:04.188 --> 10:06.357
To make sure Kevin gets home safe.

10:07.024 --> 10:08.067
Right?

10:09.694 --> 10:10.695
Right.

10:10.945 --> 10:13.864
Then let's get on the plane
and work this out like civilized adults.

10:15.199 --> 10:17.952
When we find Kevin,
you don't speak to him, okay?

10:18.119 --> 10:20.037
I will talk to him. He didn't call you.

10:20.371 --> 10:23.207
<i>- He called me.</i>
- And what exactly did he say?

10:23.874 --> 10:27.503
What did he specifically say
that leads you to believe he's delusional?

10:27.712 --> 10:30.256
Did he see something or someone?

10:32.341 --> 10:36.220
- Did she tell you?
- She said he was upset.

10:36.804 --> 10:38.139
Upset about what, exactly?

10:38.556 --> 10:41.392
Because I'm getting the feeling
we're not hearing the entire story.

10:41.684 --> 10:44.895
No, the whole story, Matt,
is in your ridiculous book,

10:45.062 --> 10:48.232
which somehow you convinced my husband
and my stepson to keep from me.

10:48.399 --> 10:51.736
Yeah, well, they kept it from you 'cause
they knew this would be your reaction.

10:52.737 --> 10:54.488
Do you think it's ridiculous, John?

10:55.281 --> 10:58.451
It doesn't matter what I think.
We'll know in the next four days, right?

10:58.701 --> 11:00.161
What happens in four days?

11:00.411 --> 11:03.331
It's the seven year anniversary
of the Departure.

11:03.914 --> 11:04.915
So?

11:06.000 --> 11:09.253
This is my plane, my mission!
And I will speak to Kevin

11:09.420 --> 11:12.256
because I absolutely refuse to believe
he's psychotic.

11:12.423 --> 11:15.051
I was married to Kevin for 15 years.

11:15.217 --> 11:17.094
He used to look
through all of our cupboards

11:17.261 --> 11:19.055
before he found the wine glasses.

11:19.221 --> 11:23.184
He has a tattoo that's misspelled,
and he shits four times a day.

11:23.434 --> 11:28.064
So I refuse, Matt, to believe that he's
the goddamn second coming of Christ!

11:28.272 --> 11:29.273
Oh!

12:42.847 --> 12:44.390
What are those?

12:45.391 --> 12:47.184
For my allergies.

12:53.232 --> 12:54.483
Michael,

12:55.151 --> 12:56.861
I need to know you're with me.

12:57.403 --> 12:59.363
- Where else would I be?
- No, no, no.

12:59.905 --> 13:04.160
I need to know you're with me, that you'll
help me bring Kevin back to Miracle,

13:04.326 --> 13:05.661
whatever it takes.

13:07.913 --> 13:10.916
Maybe we should just ask him
what he wants to do.

13:13.252 --> 13:14.962
We can't land in Melbourne.

13:16.505 --> 13:17.840
What's happening?

13:18.591 --> 13:20.593
The airport's shut down.
They're diverting us.

13:20.759 --> 13:23.471
No, no. We're a relief mission.
We're authorized.

13:23.971 --> 13:25.222
They don't care.

13:25.681 --> 13:27.057
Where can we land?

13:27.892 --> 13:29.101
Tasmania.

13:29.602 --> 13:31.061
<i>Tasmania?</i>

13:31.479 --> 13:33.647
Then how the hell do we get to Melbourne?

13:49.205 --> 13:51.457
Is this where I get tickets
for the ferry to Melbourne?

13:51.624 --> 13:53.375
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, thank God.

13:53.626 --> 13:56.212
Our plane was forced to land,
and we're stranded here.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.797
Not that Tasmania isn't lovely.

13:59.924 --> 14:01.717
Uh, three tickets, please.

14:02.092 --> 14:04.595
- Hey, fuck you, Matt.
- Come on, man.

14:04.845 --> 14:07.848
Sorry. Four tickets.

14:08.516 --> 14:10.851
- How long is the journey there?
- Eleven hours.

14:12.061 --> 14:14.688
Okay, okay. Eleven hours. Not bad, huh?

14:14.939 --> 14:17.775
Unfortunately, tonight's ferry is booked
for a private group.

14:18.192 --> 14:22.530
I'm afraid our first available
is the day after tomorrow.

14:22.696 --> 14:25.282
No, no, that's too late.
We need to get to Melbourne immediately.

14:25.449 --> 14:29.161
This private group
must have a few extra seats.

14:29.537 --> 14:31.205
They bought the boat, sir.

14:32.456 --> 14:36.043
If you wanna get on, I'm afraid
you're gonna have to take it up with them.

14:52.560 --> 14:54.270
Are they putting a lion on that boat?

14:54.895 --> 14:56.105
Sure looks like it.

15:00.651 --> 15:02.736
Hi. Nice to see you girls.
Come in, come in.

15:04.196 --> 15:06.782
I know I marked you off. Right.

15:08.325 --> 15:09.994
Hello. How are you today?

15:10.744 --> 15:13.038
I'm 91, and I'm having a son.

15:14.290 --> 15:15.583
I'm sorry?

15:16.542 --> 15:19.169
I'm 91, and I'm having a son.

15:20.838 --> 15:22.756
I think she wants you
to say something, man.

15:23.090 --> 15:26.844
- Oh! Uh, what is it you want me to say?
- Are you a member of our pride?

15:27.511 --> 15:30.556
No, but if we could become members,
we're willing to pay.

15:30.723 --> 15:32.725
Oh, no, no. No money allowed.

15:37.980 --> 15:41.525
How come you didn't ask that guy
whether he's 91 and having a son?

15:41.692 --> 15:43.444
Well, he's a friend of the captain.

15:44.945 --> 15:47.448
Well, uh,
we're friends of the captain, too.

15:49.617 --> 15:52.036
- Is that true?
- No.

15:55.706 --> 15:58.959
Listen, we have a friend in Melbourne
who's in trouble.

15:59.376 --> 16:02.254
He needs our help. Your boat
is the only way we can get to him.

16:02.421 --> 16:05.966
I'm appealing to your sense of charity
to let us on board.

16:07.176 --> 16:08.218
No.

16:09.011 --> 16:11.013
There's gonna be sex on this boat.

16:11.597 --> 16:13.432
There's gonna be a lot of it.

16:13.891 --> 16:17.186
Debased and sinful from port to port,
all without judgment.

16:17.561 --> 16:20.981
- Is that gonna be all right for you?
- Absolutely. Yeah.

16:22.691 --> 16:26.111
Well, then why don't you tell me
the filthiest joke that you know?

16:29.698 --> 16:31.867
- A panda goes into...
- No, no, no. Not you.

16:33.118 --> 16:34.244
Him.

16:37.373 --> 16:41.251
What's the difference between a pimple
and a priest?

16:43.879 --> 16:47.591
A pimple waits until you're 12
to come on your face.

16:52.680 --> 16:54.223
Righty-o, then.

16:55.099 --> 16:56.767
The lady has free reign.

16:57.434 --> 16:59.144
<i>No law can govern the lioness.</i>

16:59.311 --> 17:02.272
And as for you fellows,
there's only one rule, so learn it well.

17:03.941 --> 17:05.526
When midnight comes,

17:06.443 --> 17:08.862
let no man mention his name

17:09.113 --> 17:11.865
lest that man become him.

17:14.284 --> 17:15.452
Who's him?

17:18.330 --> 17:19.581
Frasier.

17:22.459 --> 17:23.752
Thank you.

17:24.503 --> 17:26.088
Off you go now. Hello.

17:48.694 --> 17:50.028
Terrorism? It was the French.

17:50.320 --> 17:52.156
You think they're starting a war
with the English?

17:52.322 --> 17:53.991
This is revenge for Agincourt?

17:55.701 --> 17:57.703
Yes, you said that already,
but when will you...

17:58.495 --> 18:02.458
No, no, I'm not at the airport. If I was
at the airport, why would I be calling?

18:03.250 --> 18:05.335
Hello? Hello?

18:12.009 --> 18:13.343
Flights are still grounded.

18:13.510 --> 18:15.679
They refuse to sell tickets
over the phone.

18:17.264 --> 18:20.768
I'm gonna go to the snack bar
to get some sandwiches. You want some?

18:21.894 --> 18:23.312
I'm not hungry.

18:29.610 --> 18:30.652
There's still time.

18:30.861 --> 18:33.363
Even if we can't get a flight,
we can take this ferry back,

18:33.530 --> 18:35.115
and Arturo can fly us home.

18:39.077 --> 18:40.329
What?

18:42.039 --> 18:45.042
We're not gonna make it back to Miracle
by the 14th, man.

18:46.376 --> 18:47.377
Yes, we are.

18:47.711 --> 18:49.755
Well, even if we find Kevin
right off the boat,

18:49.922 --> 18:52.174
there's no guarantee
he's gonna come back with us.

18:55.803 --> 18:58.972
I think we need to accept
that whatever's gonna happen,

18:59.723 --> 19:01.058
is gonna happen here.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.977
No, no. We're bringing him home.

19:04.144 --> 19:07.231
He has to be in Miracle. You two
should know that better than anyone.

19:07.439 --> 19:09.274
It was spared for a reason. It's special.

19:09.441 --> 19:13.028
You know, it... It cured my wife.
It gave me my son.

19:13.737 --> 19:17.074
And my wife left me,
and I lost my daughter.

19:18.450 --> 19:20.619
<i>It's got nothing to do
with where we live, man.</i>

19:21.537 --> 19:24.498
We've just got to let go
and see what happens.

19:24.665 --> 19:26.416
We're not in control of this thing.

19:27.334 --> 19:30.420
Yeah, well,
that's 'cause you gave control to Laurie.

19:33.757 --> 19:37.553
Maybe if you'd given a little more control
to Mary, she wouldn't have left.

19:38.387 --> 19:40.347
Mary leaving was a test.

19:40.722 --> 19:43.642
A test of my faith in that place
to see if I'd leave.

19:43.809 --> 19:47.104
So, if you think I'm gonna be in goddamn
Australia on the day of reckoning...

19:47.271 --> 19:48.730
<i>- Matt.</i>
- What?

19:49.940 --> 19:51.275
You're bleeding.

19:53.777 --> 19:54.903
It's fine.

19:57.281 --> 19:59.992
I'm fine. It's fine. I'm fine.

20:30.981 --> 20:32.274
He hit you, huh?

20:33.442 --> 20:36.528
- What?
- Your nose. God hit you.

20:37.654 --> 20:38.822
No shame in it, mate.

20:39.156 --> 20:41.575
I've seen God smite
many a man on this boat.

20:42.117 --> 20:43.827
Ice bags in the infirmary if you need one.

20:45.245 --> 20:46.455
Sorry.

20:47.122 --> 20:49.833
Are you asking
if God punched me in the face?

20:50.417 --> 20:51.501
Indeed.

20:51.668 --> 20:55.005
The one true Lord, Yahweh. Holy of holies.

20:55.464 --> 20:58.842
Voice of the Olympics.
Red hat and a beard. Likes the top deck.

20:59.843 --> 21:01.511
But I'd steer clear if I were you.

21:20.864 --> 21:22.115
Excuse me, sir.

21:27.454 --> 21:28.664
Sir.

21:34.753 --> 21:36.088
I'm sorry to bother you,

21:36.380 --> 21:38.548
but are you telling people you're God?

21:56.525 --> 21:58.235
<i>"I am the one true God.</i>

21:58.568 --> 22:01.863
<i>"I go by many names,
but Mr. Burton is fine.</i>

22:02.406 --> 22:03.991
<i>"I will not take a photo with you.</i>

22:04.408 --> 22:07.494
<i>"There was no big bang.
Just nothing, then light.</i>

22:07.953 --> 22:09.079
<i>"Yes, I created you.</i>

22:10.288 --> 22:13.333
"No, I didn't create unicorns.

22:13.500 --> 22:17.379
"Eve was not made from Adam's rib.
It was his tibia.

22:18.088 --> 22:21.508
"I asked Abraham to kill Isaac
just to see if he'd do it.

22:21.675 --> 22:25.345
"Yes, evolution is real,
but it doesn't work how you think it does.

22:25.512 --> 22:27.931
"I won the bronze medal for decathlon,

22:28.098 --> 22:30.767
"and the one you can't remember
is the hammer throw.

22:30.934 --> 22:33.145
"No, I had nothing to do with the Crusades

22:33.311 --> 22:37.399
"nor any type of genocide/holocaust."
Can you believe this guy?

22:37.566 --> 22:38.942
It was just a joke.

22:39.109 --> 22:40.444
It's blasphemy, is what it is.

22:40.610 --> 22:42.279
You know he's not God.
Why does it bother you?

22:42.446 --> 22:45.407
Because he's saying he is.
You know, he didn't even talk to me.

22:45.574 --> 22:49.202
He just handed me a card and wandered off
like I was asking for an autograph.

22:51.413 --> 22:52.956
I think you should tell Laurie
you're sick.

22:53.123 --> 22:54.583
I'm not sick.

22:55.042 --> 22:56.501
Yes, you are.

22:57.127 --> 22:59.421
- You should tell her.
- Why would I do that?

23:02.049 --> 23:04.009
My dad used to keep everything inside.

23:04.634 --> 23:06.303
Even with my mom.

23:07.637 --> 23:11.683
All that time, he was just pretending
he wasn't so angry.

23:13.977 --> 23:15.979
Then he met Laurie,
and she made him better.

23:17.689 --> 23:20.317
No, he got better because of us,

23:20.984 --> 23:23.403
because of the work we've been doing,
because of the book.

23:23.612 --> 23:27.157
Laurie gave him psychobabble.
We gave him faith.

23:27.824 --> 23:30.869
She doesn't believe in the same thing
we do, but she wants to help Kevin.

23:31.369 --> 23:34.164
I think she'd wanna help you, too,
if you just talk to her.

23:34.790 --> 23:36.583
She's not part of this.

23:37.918 --> 23:40.545
Matthew, John, Michael,
they were all disciples.

23:43.465 --> 23:45.092
Maybe Laurie's one, too.

24:30.637 --> 24:32.305
Hey, big boy. Wanna party?

24:33.557 --> 24:35.058
Don't bother with those two.

24:38.895 --> 24:42.941
- Hey, how's your nose?
- Oh, it's fine. It was nothing.

24:44.401 --> 24:48.405
Do you mind
if I speak to Laurie alone for a minute?

24:50.866 --> 24:53.076
Uh, sure. Of course.

24:54.119 --> 24:55.537
I'll be inside with Michael.

25:01.251 --> 25:04.754
That couple just asked me and John
to be part of a four-way.

25:06.506 --> 25:08.049
How flattering.

25:08.967 --> 25:11.386
Well, at least I learned about this pride
that we joined.

25:12.554 --> 25:14.181
Yes. Apparently, back in the '70s,

25:14.347 --> 25:18.768
there was a whole bunch of these lionesses
in some wild animal park in California

25:18.935 --> 25:21.188
that refused to mate
with any of the males there.

25:21.354 --> 25:22.939
They just... They wouldn't have it.

25:23.565 --> 25:25.817
But then something amazing happened.

25:26.234 --> 25:30.238
The park rescued
this old fleabag of a lion

25:30.405 --> 25:33.074
from a bankrupt Mexican circus.

25:33.241 --> 25:36.286
He was ancient. He was, like, in his 90s.
It was a charity case.

25:36.453 --> 25:40.123
And they brought him to the park
so he could live out his days in peace.

25:40.999 --> 25:42.459
By the next morning,

25:42.751 --> 25:45.754
he had screwed each
and every one of those lionesses

25:45.921 --> 25:48.465
and ended up fathering 35 cubs.

25:48.715 --> 25:52.469
- Ah, the infamous Frasier.
- Ooh, be careful.

25:52.802 --> 25:55.347
It's after midnight.
No man may speak his name...

25:55.555 --> 25:57.474
Lest that man become him.

25:58.266 --> 26:00.227
That lion that we saw
that they put on the boat

26:00.393 --> 26:02.395
is one of his descendants supposedly.

26:02.729 --> 26:07.817
They're taking him around the world to
different zoos so he can spread his seed.

26:07.984 --> 26:10.987
Well, that is the foundation
of any respectable religion.

26:15.242 --> 26:16.451
You know,

26:18.161 --> 26:19.955
I think we should play it your way.

26:20.997 --> 26:22.332
I'm sorry?

26:22.999 --> 26:24.334
With... With Kevin.

26:25.168 --> 26:27.254
I mean, letting him believe
that he's a messiah

26:27.420 --> 26:29.839
might be our best chance
of earning his trust.

26:30.507 --> 26:33.510
Let's be honest, you have a better story.

26:34.511 --> 26:35.929
My story is true.

26:39.224 --> 26:42.602
- Come on, Matt.
- It's all true. It's based on fact.

26:42.852 --> 26:44.813
I just wrote down what Kevin experienced.

26:45.063 --> 26:48.984
He experienced hallucinations.
He saw things that weren't there.

26:49.150 --> 26:51.236
How do you know?
How do you know they weren't there?

26:51.403 --> 26:53.697
Because Patti is dead.
Because Evie is dead.

26:53.863 --> 26:55.699
If you wrote a book every time
somebody thought they saw...

26:55.865 --> 26:57.033
Evie?

27:04.874 --> 27:07.627
Is that what he said when he called you?

27:09.421 --> 27:10.964
Did Kevin see Evie?

27:14.217 --> 27:15.719
Please don't say anything.

27:17.554 --> 27:19.431
John and Michael, they wouldn't...

27:19.723 --> 27:23.560
- Just please, please, Matt.
- What kind of person do you think I am?

27:25.437 --> 27:26.438
I...

27:27.981 --> 27:32.193
- I think you're a good person.
- I think you're a good person, too.

27:36.906 --> 27:41.244
- Can I buy you a drink?
- No, I'd just like a moment alone.

27:42.787 --> 27:45.582
- To pray.
- Okay.

27:46.291 --> 27:48.710
Well, we'll be at the bar.

27:50.462 --> 27:54.215
If you can't find us,
just look for the orgy.

27:54.507 --> 27:55.717
Godspeed.

28:25.288 --> 28:26.539
Stop! Stop!

28:36.800 --> 28:38.259
Man overboard!

28:39.427 --> 28:40.720
Man overboard!

28:46.142 --> 28:47.477
I saw you.

28:48.061 --> 28:49.354
I saw what you did.

29:00.323 --> 29:01.908
There's a man in the water!

29:04.244 --> 29:06.037
There's a man in the water!

29:21.761 --> 29:23.596
<i>I think he's jumped.</i>

29:24.472 --> 29:26.975
<i>- Didn't he call?
- What are you doing, mate?</i>

29:39.362 --> 29:43.074
- What the hell were you thinking?
- I was trying to save a man's life!

29:44.701 --> 29:47.745
You need to get the ship's manifest
and account for every passenger.

29:48.079 --> 29:50.874
Whoever's not on the boat,
that's the man I saw go over.

29:51.207 --> 29:53.126
There is no manifest, mate.

29:53.376 --> 29:56.463
- Your people bought out the whole boat.
- My people?

29:57.338 --> 29:59.591
I'm not one of those lunatics.
Listen to me.

30:00.049 --> 30:02.635
There's a dangerous man on board.
I can identify him.

30:02.927 --> 30:05.472
He's wearing a red hat
and calling himself God.

30:06.389 --> 30:07.974
You mean David Burton.

30:08.391 --> 30:09.559
You know him?

30:10.852 --> 30:13.062
That woman,
she said he was a friend of the captain.

30:13.229 --> 30:15.899
I'd hardly call him a friend,
but I know him, sure.

30:16.232 --> 30:18.401
We all do. He's a celebrity.

30:18.776 --> 30:20.278
A celebrity?

30:20.737 --> 30:24.073
He was a broadcaster in the Sydney Games.
Had quite the touch.

30:25.200 --> 30:27.243
He was a decathlete back in the '80s.

30:27.619 --> 30:30.788
- Medaled for Australia.
- Yeah! Yeah, the bronze.

30:31.247 --> 30:33.208
I read about it on the card he gave me.

30:33.374 --> 30:36.085
Right after
he washed his hands of the Holocaust.

30:36.294 --> 30:37.921
But what it fails to clarify

30:38.171 --> 30:41.716
is how he went from being
a sports announcer to Yahweh.

30:44.010 --> 30:46.012
It was after he died.

30:47.096 --> 30:48.306
Yeah... What?

30:52.560 --> 30:55.271
About three years back,
he went rock climbing with a mate

30:55.438 --> 30:57.023
just outside Perth.

30:57.315 --> 30:59.359
He fell 100 meters.

30:59.984 --> 31:01.277
Broke his neck.

31:01.694 --> 31:05.281
His mate dragged his body into the cave
so the dingoes wouldn't eat the corpse,

31:05.532 --> 31:08.618
made his way back to civilization,
but when they got back there,

31:09.118 --> 31:11.246
Burton was sitting
at the front of the cave,

31:11.788 --> 31:13.122
not a scratch on him.

31:13.289 --> 31:17.710
Said he felt absolutely fine
and that he was God.

31:24.717 --> 31:27.887
People don't actually believe
this guy is God?

31:28.805 --> 31:32.016
Some do, sure.
Most are just having a laugh.

31:32.850 --> 31:35.979
I don't think he expected so many people
to be pestering him,

31:36.145 --> 31:37.855
so he hands out those cards,

31:38.147 --> 31:39.732
the frequently asked questions.

31:40.441 --> 31:41.985
Spends most of his time in Tasmania.

31:42.151 --> 31:45.113
He's got a little cabin down there.
He's quite a private sort of fellow.

31:45.572 --> 31:49.701
Spends a bit of time on the ferry,
just to be amongst the people.

31:50.660 --> 31:52.161
So he can murder them?

31:52.662 --> 31:54.831
We don't have any other witnesses.

31:55.665 --> 31:57.041
Nobody reported missing.

31:57.208 --> 32:02.088
Well, those sex-crazed maniacs
wouldn't notice anyone missing.

32:02.297 --> 32:07.302
Burton walks in here and confesses,
I'll be happy to contact the authorities.

32:08.303 --> 32:10.430
We dock in Melbourne in a few hours.

32:10.930 --> 32:12.473
Until then, mate,

32:12.807 --> 32:15.393
I suggest you go and find some dry clothes

32:16.185 --> 32:17.687
and enjoy the ride.

32:28.865 --> 32:30.408
You believe me, don't you?

32:32.118 --> 32:34.621
Yeah. Of course.

32:39.208 --> 32:42.670
Like when I told you
I didn't molest my comatose wife?

33:37.850 --> 33:39.143
Excuse me.

33:40.770 --> 33:43.523
- What?
- Where's your list?

33:44.273 --> 33:46.359
- What?
- When we got on the boat,

33:46.526 --> 33:48.945
you had a list of your members.
Where is it?

33:50.071 --> 33:51.489
Oh, I don't know. Somewhere.

33:51.823 --> 33:55.618
One of your people has gone in the water.
We need to find out who he is.

33:55.952 --> 33:57.161
Oh, no, thanks.

33:58.871 --> 34:00.832
You don't care
that somebody's been killed?

34:01.708 --> 34:02.917
No, not really.

34:03.960 --> 34:06.295
Of course not. Why would you?

34:06.671 --> 34:09.507
All you care about
is fucking each other and Frasier!

34:13.594 --> 34:16.472
- What?
- You spoke his name.

34:21.185 --> 34:24.564
He spoke his name!

34:24.772 --> 34:27.525
<i>He spoke his name!</i>

34:27.692 --> 34:32.947
He spoke his name! He spoke his name!

34:33.114 --> 34:35.241
<i>He spoke his name!</i>

34:35.408 --> 34:36.993
<i>Become him!</i>

34:37.160 --> 34:39.120
<i>Become him!</i>

34:39.704 --> 34:42.582
- Become him! Become him!
<i>- Become him!</i>

34:42.874 --> 34:48.838
- Become him! Become him! Become him!
- Become him! Become him! Become him!

35:01.184 --> 35:03.728
<i>In darkest Tijuana,</i>

35:04.353 --> 35:06.773
<i>at 91 years of age,</i>

35:06.939 --> 35:11.819
<i>who, by the force of man,
was taken from his home?</i>

35:12.361 --> 35:14.197
Frasier!

35:14.363 --> 35:16.783
<i>Taken north across the border,</i>

35:17.033 --> 35:19.744
<i>where the lioness awaits a worthy mate.</i>

35:20.119 --> 35:23.915
<i>Who is the king that she awaits?</i>

35:24.081 --> 35:27.418
Frasier! Frasier!

35:27.585 --> 35:30.880
Frasier! Frasier!

35:35.968 --> 35:41.682
Become him. Become him. Become him.

36:15.925 --> 36:17.218
What are you doing?

36:20.555 --> 36:21.889
What are you doing?

36:33.276 --> 36:36.737
- No!
<i>- 91 and still in his prime!</i>

36:37.280 --> 36:39.782
- Please!
<i>- 91 to father a pride!</i>

36:40.199 --> 36:42.577
<i>Who will give his seed?</i>

36:42.910 --> 36:44.996
Frasier!

36:45.371 --> 36:47.582
No! Please. Please, no!

36:48.457 --> 36:49.625
No!

36:51.085 --> 36:54.297
No, no, no!

36:56.716 --> 36:58.050
No!

37:00.136 --> 37:02.388
<i>You people are sick!</i>

37:04.015 --> 37:06.392
<i>One of your people is out there murdered,</i>

37:06.601 --> 37:09.770
<i>floating in the water,
and you're in here doing this!</i>

37:10.104 --> 37:12.732
<i>You ought to be ashamed of yourself.</i>

37:35.171 --> 37:36.172
Hey!

37:36.464 --> 37:39.467
I saw you. I know what you did.
You think you can get away with this?

37:39.759 --> 37:42.470
Don't ignore me. I'm talking to you.

38:05.159 --> 38:06.702
Are you all right?

38:08.329 --> 38:09.872
I heard what you said in there.

38:10.289 --> 38:12.291
You're right. They're sick.

38:14.794 --> 38:16.379
We're not all like them.

38:17.505 --> 38:18.756
There's a plan.

38:19.048 --> 38:21.884
When we dock, be sure you stay on the boat
until it's safe.

38:23.594 --> 38:26.222
When we dock, stay on the boat.

38:40.069 --> 38:42.947
- Jesus, Matt. You look terrible.
- I'm fine.

38:43.531 --> 38:46.492
- I just need to speak to Michael and John.
- About what?

38:46.993 --> 38:49.912
Please, Laurie. It's in your best interest
if you're not involved.

38:51.163 --> 38:54.250
You know, whatever you got to say to us,
you can say to her.

38:56.002 --> 38:59.380
No one seems to care
that I just witnessed a murder.

39:00.548 --> 39:02.800
The man who perpetrated it
just assaulted me.

39:03.259 --> 39:05.928
- He what?
- He hit me with impunity,

39:06.262 --> 39:08.055
and he needs to be dealt with.

39:09.557 --> 39:10.808
Dealt with how?

39:11.183 --> 39:13.352
We need to compel him
to confess to what he did.

39:13.519 --> 39:16.188
Be not deceived. God shall not be mocked.

39:16.605 --> 39:19.942
For whatsoever a man soweth,
that shall he also reap.

39:20.109 --> 39:22.194
No, we're not reaping anyone, man.

39:24.488 --> 39:28.409
You used to burn men's houses down
for pretending to be things they're not.

39:29.660 --> 39:31.120
What happened to you, John?

39:32.496 --> 39:34.040
What happened to your wrath?

39:39.503 --> 39:40.838
He found peace.

39:43.299 --> 39:45.134
He thinks his daughter's still alive.

39:45.843 --> 39:47.261
That's not peace.

39:52.808 --> 39:53.976
What?

39:54.894 --> 39:56.020
Nothing.

39:58.189 --> 39:59.398
What?

40:02.735 --> 40:05.071
Kevin told her he saw Evangeline.

40:06.614 --> 40:07.698
Here.

40:09.075 --> 40:10.409
In Australia.

40:15.581 --> 40:16.791
Is that true?

40:21.295 --> 40:22.379
It...

40:23.881 --> 40:25.049
It wasn't her.

40:25.508 --> 40:27.593
What he saw was... Was, uh...

40:28.177 --> 40:30.346
It was a manifestation of... It was...

40:30.846 --> 40:32.098
She wasn't real.

40:32.681 --> 40:34.600
And if I told you, you would've...

40:36.685 --> 40:38.687
I didn't want to hurt you.

40:42.024 --> 40:43.359
I understand.

40:45.653 --> 40:47.404
I wouldn't have told me, either.

40:55.871 --> 40:57.581
I understand, too.

40:58.874 --> 41:00.042
She was protecting you.

41:00.251 --> 41:03.129
That's what we're supposed to do
for each other. I'm sorry.

41:10.511 --> 41:12.721
It's been a long day.
I haven't had any sleep.

41:15.224 --> 41:18.394
We all need to get some rest
before we dock.

41:20.229 --> 41:24.066
They've offered me a bed to lie down in
in the infirmary.

41:24.233 --> 41:25.943
I... I think I'll take them up on it.

41:28.404 --> 41:31.407
This is a distraction.
We need to focus on Kevin now.

43:36.198 --> 43:37.783
Where's my book?

43:39.660 --> 43:41.036
I threw it overboard.

43:43.163 --> 43:44.164
Oh.

43:45.082 --> 43:46.292
It was just getting good.

43:48.460 --> 43:50.087
You know how it ends.

43:50.713 --> 43:52.131
What makes you say that?

43:53.048 --> 43:54.883
Because you know everything.

43:57.886 --> 43:59.555
You're being sarcastic.

44:00.180 --> 44:04.226
No. I was just wondering why I haven't
been struck down by lightning yet.

44:05.936 --> 44:10.733
Why don't you transform those ropes
into serpents and free yourself?

44:12.067 --> 44:13.610
I don't need to do that.

44:14.820 --> 44:17.656
You're going to untie me
once you get what you want.

44:19.241 --> 44:20.743
And what is it I want?

44:24.955 --> 44:26.415
My attention.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.752
I already have your attention.

44:31.170 --> 44:33.630
No, not yet.

44:34.757 --> 44:37.551
Not yet?
Well, you're finally talking to me.

44:40.220 --> 44:41.430
Shh.

44:42.681 --> 44:44.475
You're agitating him.

44:53.734 --> 44:55.194
Admit what you did.

44:56.111 --> 44:57.696
I've done lots of things.

44:59.573 --> 45:01.283
You threw that man overboard.

45:02.618 --> 45:03.660
Okay.

45:04.161 --> 45:05.788
<i>- Okay?</i>
- Sure.

45:09.041 --> 45:10.250
Say it.

45:11.335 --> 45:13.087
I threw that man overboard.

45:18.133 --> 45:21.553
You'll tell the captain
and the authorities?

45:21.720 --> 45:22.971
No.

45:24.306 --> 45:25.307
Why not?

45:26.016 --> 45:27.810
Because I'm the authority.

45:28.894 --> 45:30.979
Right, you're the authority on everything.

45:31.480 --> 45:34.858
Creation, Isaac and Abraham,
the decathlon.

45:35.067 --> 45:37.194
And yet you only won the bronze.

45:37.611 --> 45:39.822
Well, that was before.

45:40.531 --> 45:43.242
Of course. Because you weren't always God.

45:43.409 --> 45:45.828
You had to die in a rock climbing accident

45:45.994 --> 45:50.749
and come back to life
just like your son Jesus, who, strangely,

45:51.333 --> 45:54.044
doesn't seem to get a mention here
on your little card.

45:54.336 --> 45:55.796
He wasn't my son.

45:57.631 --> 45:59.299
You're denying paternity?

45:59.925 --> 46:01.718
Mary's word versus mine.

46:03.303 --> 46:07.182
And yet you still see fit
to steal his story for yourself.

46:07.516 --> 46:09.810
He was the one who died and rose again.

46:10.227 --> 46:13.147
No, he rotted in the cave.

46:16.191 --> 46:17.192
What?

46:17.943 --> 46:20.195
Jesus had an identical twin brother.

46:20.904 --> 46:23.198
That's who everyone saw a few days later,

46:23.824 --> 46:25.242
thus the confusion.

46:27.202 --> 46:28.745
So you take no responsibility

46:28.912 --> 46:32.541
for your only son giving his life
for the sins of mankind?

46:33.375 --> 46:35.502
Seems a lot to ask somebody.

46:36.712 --> 46:39.089
Then what do you take responsibility for?

46:40.674 --> 46:42.009
Dinosaurs?

46:42.468 --> 46:43.677
The Black Plague?

46:44.178 --> 46:46.054
Mount Everest? The <i>Mona Lisa?</i>

46:46.221 --> 46:48.056
- The Sudden Departure?
- Yeah.

46:48.640 --> 46:49.892
That was me.

46:55.731 --> 46:57.524
The Sudden Departure was you?

46:57.774 --> 46:58.775
Uh-huh.

47:02.613 --> 47:03.614
Why?

47:05.908 --> 47:07.534
Because I could.

47:11.580 --> 47:13.415
You're gonna have to do better than that.

47:14.082 --> 47:16.001
- No, I don't.
- You do.

47:16.919 --> 47:19.421
- Why?
- Because there has to be a reason.

47:20.422 --> 47:22.424
<i>- Why?</i>
- Everything in my life,

47:22.591 --> 47:24.426
- I've done for a reason.
- Why?

47:24.885 --> 47:27.012
To help people. To guide them.

47:27.596 --> 47:30.599
To ease their suffering,
even though I suffered myself.

47:31.266 --> 47:33.268
I sacrificed my happiness.

47:34.102 --> 47:36.772
- I let my family abandon me.
- Why?

47:37.064 --> 47:38.774
For you!

47:49.284 --> 47:53.080
Everything you've done, you've done
because you thought I was watching,

47:53.497 --> 47:55.582
because you thought I was judging.

47:56.959 --> 47:58.126
But I wasn't.

47:58.835 --> 47:59.962
I'm not.

48:02.089 --> 48:03.966
You've never done anything for me.

48:04.967 --> 48:06.426
You did it for yourself.

48:14.101 --> 48:15.686
Is that why you're killing me?

48:24.653 --> 48:26.780
When I was a boy, I was sick.

48:27.573 --> 48:31.827
And I prayed to you to save me,
and you did.

48:36.748 --> 48:38.292
Why is it back?

48:40.419 --> 48:42.212
I can save you again.

48:45.549 --> 48:47.884
No, you can't.

48:51.847 --> 48:53.181
Untie me.

49:55.702 --> 49:56.787
Ta-da.

49:57.579 --> 49:59.081
You're saved.

50:15.639 --> 50:18.266
<i>Ladies and gents,
we will be docking in Melbourne shortly.</i>

50:18.892 --> 50:21.436
<i>Please dispose all rubbish
and collect your personal belongings</i>

50:21.603 --> 50:23.146
<i>before you disembark.</i>

50:23.689 --> 50:26.858
<i>Thank you for sailing with us.
We do hope you enjoyed the voyage.</i>

50:34.616 --> 50:35.951
<i>There you are.</i>

50:42.666 --> 50:44.418
Fishing boat found a body.

50:45.460 --> 50:47.129
Matches your description.

50:48.463 --> 50:50.090
I've notified the police.

50:52.843 --> 50:55.554
They'll be taking Burton into custody
when we dock.

50:57.806 --> 51:00.559
They'd like you to go down to the station
and make a statement,

51:01.852 --> 51:05.063
assuming you don't have
any pressing business in Melbourne.

51:09.943 --> 51:11.319
No, I don't.

51:34.468 --> 51:35.552
<i>Relax.</i>

52:02.746 --> 52:03.747
Hey.

52:04.331 --> 52:05.540
Did you get some rest?

52:06.374 --> 52:07.793
Yeah, I did.

52:10.754 --> 52:12.547
Thank you all for coming.

52:13.423 --> 52:14.758
I'm glad you're here.

52:17.385 --> 52:18.720
Are you okay?

52:23.642 --> 52:25.310
Actually, Laurie,

52:27.395 --> 52:28.897
I'm dying.

52:33.276 --> 52:34.569
What?

53:01.012 --> 53:03.515
David Burton, you are under arrest!

53:04.266 --> 53:07.811
<i>Out of the way! Out of the way!
All of you! Stay clear!</i>

53:09.229 --> 53:10.647
<i>Get behind the barrier!</i>

53:21.783 --> 53:22.784
Ahh!

53:49.853 --> 53:52.063
That's the guy I was telling you about.

54:54.584 --> 54:55.585
English - SDH
