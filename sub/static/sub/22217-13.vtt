[narrator] <i>Previously on </i> Dynasty:

00:13.596 --> 00:16.056
The Carringtons are the reason
Dad's in prison.

00:16.140 --> 00:18.143
Blake framed him with drug charges.

00:18.226 --> 00:20.812
Ted Dinard's here for you.
Last time I saw him,

00:20.895 --> 00:23.189
I assumed would be the last time.

00:23.273 --> 00:25.692
I'm writing a major expose on Daniels.

00:25.775 --> 00:29.738
One of the people that Daniels
took bribes from... was Blake.

00:29.821 --> 00:33.158
I protected you from scandal,
I had to protect my integrity.

00:33.241 --> 00:36.244
And that meant ending Daniels' campaign.

00:36.327 --> 00:40.623
After listening to Daniels spin his web
of discrimination, I got to thinking.

00:40.707 --> 00:43.752
Time to bet on myself.
I'm running for office.

00:44.794 --> 00:48.089
[Monica] Culhane was watching you.
I had to sell a different story.

00:48.173 --> 00:49.090
Damn, Monica.

00:49.174 --> 00:51.468
They're why
we were raised with no father.

00:51.551 --> 00:54.846
You wanna make them pay
for what they've done? So do I.

00:56.723 --> 00:59.809
<i>♪ Every time I think of you ♪</i>

00:59.893 --> 01:04.397
I'm glad we're friends again, but I don't
miss you dragging me to Pilates at 7.

01:04.480 --> 01:07.734
-I think I pulled something.
-It means it's working.

01:07.817 --> 01:11.112
Can we bond over something normal?
Booze? Bad decisions?

01:11.196 --> 01:13.698
What kind of bad decisions
are you talking?

01:13.782 --> 01:17.619
Not like "vomiting whiskey sours
in the halls of Ivy House" bad.

01:17.702 --> 01:19.579
-I remember that night.
-[laughs]

01:19.662 --> 01:22.165
Was that the time
you pretended to be French?

01:22.248 --> 01:25.877
No, you pretended to be poor
so you could bum cigarettes.

01:27.045 --> 01:29.839
Oh, I'm gonna miss that place.
It was an era.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.425
-What do you mean "miss"?
-You didn't hear?

01:32.509 --> 01:36.262
-Ivy House is closing next week.
-Oh, my God. We have to go.

01:36.346 --> 01:39.599
One last night before it goes.
What are you doing tonight?

01:39.682 --> 01:43.186
Picking you up at 9
and staying away from whiskey sours.

01:46.689 --> 01:48.983
Please tell me one of those is for me.

01:49.984 --> 01:52.737
It was, but I don't know
how hot it is anymore.

01:52.821 --> 01:56.157
I spent an hour and a half
on a device called a reformer,

01:56.241 --> 01:59.369
thanks to your sister.
You don't have aspirin, do you?

01:59.994 --> 02:01.830
This will make you feel better.

02:05.083 --> 02:06.209
My counteroffer.

02:06.292 --> 02:09.378
Wait. You're actually gonna
let me buy you out?

02:10.420 --> 02:13.800
It may have been my money,
but this company has your soul.

02:14.384 --> 02:17.637
Took me time to realize it,
but Morell should be yours.

02:17.720 --> 02:19.848
Our lawyers can figure out the rest.

02:20.473 --> 02:22.308
What made you change your mind?

02:22.392 --> 02:24.978
Monica nudged me in the right direction.

02:25.979 --> 02:29.899
Well, whatever she said, thank you, Jeff.

02:31.442 --> 02:33.945
You have no idea
how much this means to me.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.784
I do. If you're lucky,
I'll throw in aspirin.

02:39.868 --> 02:40.952
[chuckles]

02:47.417 --> 02:50.587
-What do you think?
-You're asking the wrong person.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.463
You're 45 minutes late.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.799
I thought 9 was more of a suggestion.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.009
[phone rings]

02:56.092 --> 02:58.303
Okay. Can you get that?
Take a message.

02:59.053 --> 03:01.514
Steven's telling Dad
he's running for office.

03:01.598 --> 03:03.516
He needs me for support.

03:04.225 --> 03:07.604
Morell Green Energy Corp.,
a subsidiary of Colby Co.

03:07.687 --> 03:11.232
Fallon Carrington's office.
Samuel speaking. How can I help?

03:11.316 --> 03:13.443
Should I call myself "Mr. Jones"?

03:13.943 --> 03:15.486
No, not you. Who's this?

03:16.946 --> 03:18.948
Are you happy with
your phone and Internet service?

03:19.032 --> 03:20.867
Okay, all right. You know what?

03:21.367 --> 03:24.829
We'll work on that later.
Let's play to your strengths.

03:26.664 --> 03:28.833
-Lunch?
-No. Girls' night.

03:29.208 --> 03:32.378
Monica and I are going out for
one last hurrah before Ivy House closes.

03:32.462 --> 03:35.048
Now we can celebrate
my sole proprietorship.

03:35.131 --> 03:38.426
-So, I need you to get us a table.
-I won't let you down.

03:45.141 --> 03:47.852
-You bring your laundry, too?
-Just the whites.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.230
I'll leave a doggy bag by the dryer.

03:50.939 --> 03:53.107
-Did I miss it?
-Miss what?

03:53.191 --> 03:56.653
Thanks for coming. I wanted
to talk to you about something.

03:56.736 --> 03:59.530
-Fallon already knows.
-You're not gay, are you?

04:00.698 --> 04:03.534
Worse. I've decided
to run for city council.

04:04.827 --> 04:08.373
-Why do that?
-Pamela Hu isn't running in district 13.

04:08.456 --> 04:11.584
I wanna do something constructive,
positive, helpful.

04:11.668 --> 04:15.088
-You sound like a Democrat.
-At least he's not a criminal.

04:15.171 --> 04:17.966
We could use more good people
in politics.

04:18.048 --> 04:20.218
We could use more Democrats.

04:20.301 --> 04:23.429
If you wanna give back,
volunteer at a soup kitchen.

04:23.513 --> 04:26.182
-Politics is a full-contact sport.
-I know.

04:26.266 --> 04:30.270
Your past becomes fair game.
You don't have a great track record.

04:30.353 --> 04:33.064
A month ago, you were snorting
half of Manhattan up your nose.

04:33.147 --> 04:35.441
-Blake.
-Daddy. Don't be old-fashioned. A couple more felonies,
he could be president.

04:39.153 --> 04:42.865
I have to get to the office.
Puppies won't kill themselves.

04:46.452 --> 04:47.745
Well, that went well. Girls' night, huh?

04:52.333 --> 04:54.877
You asked me to help you
get Fallon back.

04:55.628 --> 04:58.298
She thinks I'm on her side
with Morell Corp.

04:58.381 --> 05:03.094
Drinks, some "hos-before-bros" crap
and she'll be hanging on to my every word,

05:03.177 --> 05:05.930
including every word about
what an amazing guy you are.

05:06.014 --> 05:10.852
Mm. A guy who'd walk away from a billion
dollar potential to make her happy.

05:10.935 --> 05:11.978
Exactly.

05:12.895 --> 05:17.066
She needs to feel like she doesn't have
to choose between you and independence,

05:17.150 --> 05:18.234
like you know her.

05:19.861 --> 05:23.656
If it doesn't work, at least you got
your money back from Morell.

05:23.740 --> 05:27.618
That's not the point.
Blake Carrington took everything from Dad.

05:27.702 --> 05:31.581
Now we're taking everything from him.
His daughter, then his empire.

05:31.664 --> 05:32.749
Eyes on the prize.

05:34.584 --> 05:35.501
You ready?

05:36.919 --> 05:41.382
I think you're doing the right thing.
Don't let your dad discourage you.

05:41.466 --> 05:43.718
Don't worry. I'm fired up about this.

05:43.801 --> 05:46.512
The first time in a long time
I feel proactive.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.931
I don't want his money anyway.

05:49.015 --> 05:51.934
If I'd listened to him,
I'd have an MBA and a better golf swing.

05:52.018 --> 05:54.771
-Heh. He's right about one thing.
-Tax cuts?

05:54.854 --> 05:56.981
Putting yourself in the public eye.

05:57.065 --> 05:59.692
People are gonna be
looking for any mistake.

05:59.776 --> 06:01.444
And I've made a lot, I know.

06:02.028 --> 06:06.365
But I can't change what happened
with Dominic Ortega or Stansfield.

06:07.158 --> 06:08.576
-Or Ted.
-Stansfield?

06:09.077 --> 06:11.913
He didn't retire early
on a government pension.

06:12.830 --> 06:17.710
I don't think we'll be seeing him soon,
much to my father's dismay.

06:19.378 --> 06:23.424
Take it from me. You can't count
on your skeletons staying in the closet.

06:24.008 --> 06:28.137
The best thing you can do is own it all.
Beat everyone to the punch.

06:29.055 --> 06:32.600
-You might be right.
-Don't tell your dad. [chuckles]

06:56.874 --> 06:57.875
Hey, Dad.

06:59.418 --> 07:00.503
[in foreign language] My baby girl.

07:02.547 --> 07:04.048
[in English] I can't believe it.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.968
-It's been--
-Eight and a half years.

07:08.678 --> 07:10.054
I am so sorry.

07:11.806 --> 07:14.851
-No, you didn't do anything.
-I didn't believe you.

07:15.768 --> 07:19.439
I spent all this time thinking
you had turned your back on us.

07:19.522 --> 07:21.441
I thought you were selfish.

07:21.524 --> 07:23.818
I had no idea what they did to you.

07:25.611 --> 07:28.030
I didn't give you
the benefit of the doubt.

07:30.074 --> 07:31.159
But I know now.

07:32.743 --> 07:33.786
And I'm here now.

07:34.537 --> 07:35.955
Thank you.

07:37.290 --> 07:41.043
And after your parole hearing tomorrow,
you'll be out of here.

07:41.794 --> 07:43.463
Yeah, I thought that before.

07:44.130 --> 07:46.924
Three times I've been
in front of the parole board.

07:47.008 --> 07:49.093
[in foreign language] And three times
he's kept me in here.

07:49.177 --> 07:54.265
[in foreign language] This time Blake
doesn't have a police chief in his pocket.

07:54.891 --> 07:59.353
And the judge that put you away
just went down in a sex scandal.

08:00.188 --> 08:02.106
[in English] His influence is eroding.

08:02.690 --> 08:05.818
And without that,
you've been a model inmate.

08:05.902 --> 08:08.696
Not a single disciplinary action
on your record.

08:09.405 --> 08:12.408
Carringtons always find a way.

08:12.492 --> 08:16.329
When you walk out those gates,
Blake will see he's not invincible.

08:17.872 --> 08:21.667
He'll feel the walls closing in
like you felt the last 11 years.

08:23.211 --> 08:25.087
But we're not gonna stop there.

08:26.047 --> 08:28.633
-I'm gonna finish what I started.
-We are.

08:31.719 --> 08:33.721
And nothing is gonna stop us.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.183
[theme music playing]

08:58.538 --> 09:00.456
I had to move your car to let Steven out.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.625
I'm leaving.
I have to meet with my lawyers.

09:03.209 --> 09:05.670
-Is everything okay?
-It's more than okay.

09:05.962 --> 09:08.798
Jeff agreed to let me
buy him out of Morell Corp.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.132
Wow.

09:11.133 --> 09:12.468
Congratulations.

09:12.593 --> 09:17.598
-You could muster more enthusiasm.
-I'm happy for you. I'm just surprised.

09:17.932 --> 09:21.352
-He wasn't too interested in selling.
-He came around.

09:21.435 --> 09:25.606
You're Blake Carrington's daughter.
Nobody comes around for no reason.

09:25.690 --> 09:28.150
I can think of a hundred million reasons.

09:28.234 --> 09:31.153
It's not like he's giving me
the company for free.

09:31.237 --> 09:35.908
-Plus, Monica talked sense into him.
-When she slapped him at the casino party?

09:37.451 --> 09:40.371
I don't care how she did it.
I care that it's happening.

09:40.454 --> 09:41.581
[phone buzzing]

09:41.998 --> 09:46.127
If there's anyone I'm worried about,
it's Sam burning the place down.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.554
I was going over numbers
in our European portfolio.

09:56.637 --> 09:59.849
We should have a conversation
about our UK operations.

09:59.932 --> 10:01.726
Sounds good. Leave your notes.

10:01.809 --> 10:05.980
We will discuss after I've read through.
I have to call D.C.

10:06.564 --> 10:10.234
After the Daniels debacle,
there's damage control to be done.

10:11.819 --> 10:14.155
Is that why you're against
Steven running for city council?

10:14.238 --> 10:17.450
Is that why you're gung ho for it,
punish me for Daniels?

10:18.409 --> 10:21.412
-You didn't tell me about Stansfield.
-Who said anything about Stansfield?

10:21.495 --> 10:23.456
-Who cares?
-Steven has no idea

10:23.539 --> 10:25.374
what he's walking into.

10:25.833 --> 10:28.461
-His name will put a target on his back.
-On his or yours?

10:28.544 --> 10:31.255
He doesn't know how I protected him,
the hits I've taken.

10:31.339 --> 10:34.759
-Hits he couldn't take.
-You haven't given him a chance.

10:35.509 --> 10:39.639
Steven is passionate about this.
He's going into it with his eyes open,

10:39.722 --> 10:42.183
owning his mistakes
instead of hiding them.

10:42.266 --> 10:45.936
What happens when it backfires?
Who will clean up the mess? Again?

10:46.520 --> 10:48.147
This is not just his problem.

10:48.230 --> 10:51.317
It's gonna expose the family.
Don't encourage him.

10:51.400 --> 10:52.985
Please. That's all I ask.

10:59.950 --> 11:01.452
[phone buzzing]

11:04.872 --> 11:06.290
-Hello?
-[Culhane] <i>Sam.</i>

11:06.374 --> 11:09.877
It's Culhane. Steven told me
that you're working for Fallon.

11:10.628 --> 11:12.963
-First day.
-Congratulations, man.

11:13.047 --> 11:15.299
-Are you at the office right now?
-Yeah.

11:15.383 --> 11:16.675
Is Jeff around?

11:17.259 --> 11:18.803
-No.
<i>-Good.</i>

11:19.387 --> 11:21.013
<i>I need to ask you a favor.</i>

11:21.097 --> 11:23.849
Says the man who never
lets me drive the Bentley.

11:24.225 --> 11:27.436
I could tell Fallon what happened
to her Gucci sweater.

11:28.229 --> 11:30.689
-What favor?
-Look around Jeff's computer.

11:30.773 --> 11:34.068
See if you find information
related to the Morell buyout.

11:34.151 --> 11:36.779
-E-mails, calls, paperwork.
-What? Why?

11:37.571 --> 11:41.200
Something's not adding up.
Jeff can't be taken at his word.

11:41.283 --> 11:44.370
This is between you and Jeff
and definitely not me.

11:44.453 --> 11:45.830
This is about Fallon.

11:46.288 --> 11:48.207
If Jeff's up to something,
she's gonna get hurt.

11:48.290 --> 11:50.543
<i>And since she's cutting your checks...</i>

11:50.626 --> 11:52.711
-Why don't you ask her?
-I tried.

11:53.045 --> 11:55.172
She's so excited
about getting her company back,

11:55.256 --> 11:57.091
I'm afraid she won't do
her usual due diligence.

11:57.675 --> 11:58.509
<i>Thanks.</i>

12:10.187 --> 12:13.399
Mr. Oakley. I trust I didn't
keep you waiting too long.

12:13.482 --> 12:14.316
Not too long.

12:15.317 --> 12:17.862
You need to get to work.
I won't waste time.

12:17.945 --> 12:19.697
We need this to happen today.

12:19.780 --> 12:23.409
We need this whole arrangement
to remain thoroughly discreet.

12:24.618 --> 12:26.328
This is for your trouble.

12:27.204 --> 12:29.540
Let us know if there are other expenses.

12:31.250 --> 12:34.128
I take it your daughter
is liking her new school?

12:34.503 --> 12:35.754
Yes, sir.

12:36.547 --> 12:37.631
We'll be in touch.

12:44.638 --> 12:46.474
I was glad that you called.

12:46.557 --> 12:50.436
There were many times I thought
about reaching out over the past month

12:50.519 --> 12:52.646
to thank you for bailing me out.

12:52.730 --> 12:56.484
But I wanted to stay focused,
put in the work to get clean.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.153
I'm really proud of you, Ted.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.864
I've been trying to do the same thing.

13:01.947 --> 13:05.409
Look in the mirror and figure out
how I can do better.

13:05.493 --> 13:06.619
I think I found it.

13:07.953 --> 13:10.206
-I've decided to run for city council.
-[chuckles]

13:11.665 --> 13:12.917
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:13.918 --> 13:17.087
No, I didn't mean it like that.
I mean, what about--?

13:17.171 --> 13:18.088
The partying?

13:18.923 --> 13:23.886
That's why I called you. With my name,
my biography is gonna be scrutinized.

13:23.969 --> 13:28.390
If my father has taught me anything,
it's that I can't hide from my past.

13:29.266 --> 13:30.601
So, I'm not gonna try.

13:31.352 --> 13:34.188
I wanna be honest
about the mistakes I've made.

13:34.271 --> 13:37.691
And that includes the mistakes
we made together.

13:37.775 --> 13:39.068
Like New York?

13:39.568 --> 13:43.447
Yeah. Don't get me wrong.
I'm not trying to drag you into this.

13:43.906 --> 13:47.701
If someone starts sniffing around,
you're in those pictures, too.

13:47.785 --> 13:50.621
-I wouldn't want you to be blindsided.
-Thanks.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.625
-Is that why you called me here?
-More than that.

13:55.543 --> 13:58.212
I wouldn't wanna do this
without your blessing.

13:58.295 --> 14:00.923
It means a lot to know
you're thinking of me.

14:07.263 --> 14:09.765
-What the hell are you doing?
-I was, um...

14:09.848 --> 14:11.809
looking for coffee maker instructions.

14:11.892 --> 14:13.852
That thing is like a spaceship.

14:14.436 --> 14:17.231
Did you check the drawer
under the coffee maker?

14:18.440 --> 14:20.776
-That would make sense.
-Sam.

14:22.111 --> 14:24.071
-Culhane made me do it.
-Do what?

14:24.154 --> 14:26.866
Look through Jeff's e-mails
and files and stuff.

14:27.449 --> 14:29.326
What would Culhane want
with Jeff's e-mails?

14:29.410 --> 14:32.329
He thinks Jeff is trying to
screw you on the buyout.

14:33.622 --> 14:34.623
[scoffs]

14:35.082 --> 14:38.252
-You have got to be kidding me.
-Please don't fire me.

14:38.419 --> 14:40.880
This job's important for my self-esteem.

14:43.132 --> 14:45.676
Want me to keep going
with the girls' night?

14:46.510 --> 14:48.095
Okay, I'll keep going.

14:53.976 --> 14:55.728
Head count. Let's go.

14:56.228 --> 14:58.105
A head count now? What happened?

15:00.566 --> 15:02.651
You heard me. Let's go.

15:10.075 --> 15:11.368
-What the hell?
-Ugh!

15:11.452 --> 15:14.204
I need backup. I need help.
He's got a weapon.

15:14.997 --> 15:16.123
I need help.

15:16.790 --> 15:19.084
-He's got a weapon.
-I didn't do anything.

15:19.168 --> 15:21.545
[alarm wailing]

15:22.880 --> 15:25.633
-Get him out of here.
-I didn't do anything.

15:31.013 --> 15:32.431
[in foreign language] Blake set me up.

15:32.514 --> 15:35.225
[in English] I don't know where that
knife came from. It wasn't mine.

15:35.309 --> 15:38.312
-He stabbed himself in his leg.
-I know. I believe you.

15:38.395 --> 15:40.064
But the parole board won't.

15:40.898 --> 15:43.651
They won't just deny parole.
They'll add time.

15:43.734 --> 15:46.695
-I'm gonna fix it.
-How? My hearing's tomorrow.

15:47.655 --> 15:48.989
I told you.

15:49.406 --> 15:51.325
Carringtons always find a way.

15:51.909 --> 15:52.993
So do I.

15:54.703 --> 15:56.622
Just sit tight, okay?

15:58.791 --> 16:03.295
I wanted to tell you I took your advice
about getting ahead of my skeletons.

16:03.796 --> 16:04.797
I met with Ted.

16:05.714 --> 16:08.008
-You didn't waste time.
-I didn't wanna lose my nerve.

16:08.092 --> 16:11.595
Ted seemed to understand
that this is something I needed to do.

16:11.679 --> 16:15.349
It was pretty liberating.
The real test will be when I announce. I have an old friend
at the <i> Atlanta Mirror. </i> He covers politics.

16:20.980 --> 16:26.068
It might be good for you to sit with him
and lay everything out on the table.

16:26.860 --> 16:28.988
I can reach out if you're ready.

16:29.071 --> 16:30.155
Thank you.

16:31.031 --> 16:35.327
You would make a good campaign manager
if you're interested in a pay cut.

16:35.411 --> 16:38.205
[chuckles] I'm just happy I can help.

16:43.210 --> 16:45.629
-What happened? Is Dad okay?
-He's fine.

16:45.713 --> 16:49.591
-He's not hurt. The thing was staged.
-I've been doing research.

16:49.675 --> 16:53.429
We need help from someone higher up.
What about Bobbi?

16:54.013 --> 16:57.182
I called her, asked her to vouch for Dad.

16:57.266 --> 16:58.809
-And?
-Maybe Blake was right

16:58.892 --> 17:00.811
keeping Stansfield in his pocket.

17:00.894 --> 17:03.355
She said she got the job
because she's on the up and up.

17:03.439 --> 17:06.525
She's not gonna compromise that,
not even for Dad.

17:06.608 --> 17:10.029
I'm calling Fallon.
No way I'm going out tonight.

17:10.237 --> 17:11.070
You have to.

17:11.821 --> 17:15.659
I'm not gonna drink and talk about boys
while Dad's future hangs in the balance.

17:15.742 --> 17:20.164
This is a setback. A temporary one,
if I have anything to say about it.

17:20.247 --> 17:22.583
I'm not gonna let it bring down
everything we're working for.

17:22.665 --> 17:23.625
Fallon can wait.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.920
If you cancel,
it'll make her think something's up.

17:27.337 --> 17:31.633
You said you were on the team.
This is what the team needs right now.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.719
Suck it up, smile, drink some Dom.

17:34.803 --> 17:36.096
I'll handle Dad. What is wrong with you?

17:42.519 --> 17:44.146
I have a feeling you're about to tell me.

17:44.229 --> 17:48.734
I caught Snoopy Jo pawing through
my desk on your behalf. Thank God I did.

17:48.817 --> 17:51.737
What if Jeff found him
or thought I put him up to it?

17:51.820 --> 17:54.031
-Fallon--
-We're in buyout negotiations.

17:54.114 --> 17:56.742
-I lose his trust, I lose my company.
-Listen--

17:56.825 --> 18:01.163
I never took you for the jealous type,
but Jeff brings out your Norman Bates.

18:01.246 --> 18:04.249
-Why can't you let it go?
-You think it's about Jeff?

18:05.292 --> 18:06.877
I was trying to protect you.

18:06.960 --> 18:09.797
How many men do I need to say this to?
I don't need your protection.

18:09.880 --> 18:12.883
Right. You're no damsel in distress,
but you're human.

18:13.967 --> 18:17.179
I love you too much
to stand by and watch you get hurt.

18:17.596 --> 18:18.764
You what?

18:19.556 --> 18:20.474
I love you.

18:23.435 --> 18:24.812
How could you say that?

18:26.855 --> 18:27.981
You're with Monica.

18:29.316 --> 18:31.652
She's gonna be here soon. I have to go.

18:36.406 --> 18:39.368
-You're early.
-It's not every day Cristal Flores--

18:39.451 --> 18:44.039
Oh, I'm so sorry. Cristal Carrington.
--summons you to her corner office.

18:44.123 --> 18:48.627
It's not a corner. And it's not every day
I have a scoop worth discussing.

18:48.710 --> 18:51.255
I owe you.
I'm gonna bring it to you first.

18:52.172 --> 18:54.258
Heir to Carrington Atlantic fortune

18:54.341 --> 18:57.052
rejects the family business
for public service.

18:57.136 --> 19:00.722
-Not Fallon.
-Steven is running for city council

19:00.806 --> 19:05.352
-on a grassroots, for-the-people platform.
-Steven has hugged his share of trees.

19:05.435 --> 19:07.354
Last I checked,
he was living in Daddy's house.

19:07.437 --> 19:10.232
Check again.
Steven wants to make a difference.

19:10.315 --> 19:12.234
It has nothing to do with Blake.

19:12.818 --> 19:15.487
Look, I appreciate the exclusive.

19:16.071 --> 19:19.324
But, you know, I built my career
sniffing out corruption.

19:19.408 --> 19:21.743
Not lobbing softball questions
at trust fund kids.

19:21.827 --> 19:25.330
From what you told me,
you've made your career on page views

19:25.414 --> 19:27.166
and unique visitor counts.

19:27.249 --> 19:30.043
Well, Steven can handle
a few hardballs.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.629
You his campaign manager now?

19:33.130 --> 19:35.090
Just an enthusiastic volunteer.

19:35.716 --> 19:36.675
[scoffs]

19:37.509 --> 19:40.095
You took a chance on me
when nobody else would.

19:40.179 --> 19:43.849
If you say there's something to this kid,
I'll take a chance, too.

19:44.933 --> 19:47.186
You've always had good instincts.

19:48.478 --> 19:52.149
If you wanted to pitch me a story,
all you had to do was call.

19:53.025 --> 19:55.444
Yeah, but I knew I'd have to convince you.

19:55.527 --> 19:57.988
And I thought
that would be easier in person.

19:59.156 --> 20:00.449
Good instinct.

20:01.783 --> 20:03.660
Let me know about that interview.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.509
This really necessary?

20:19.885 --> 20:21.094
Dark alley, I mean?

20:22.804 --> 20:25.390
If you're trying to creep me out,
it's working.

20:25.474 --> 20:28.352
Can't be your first dark alley
in your line of work.

20:28.435 --> 20:31.647
Investigative journalism has led
to fewer shadowy meetings

20:31.730 --> 20:34.775
than <i>All the President's Men</i>
had me believe. More texting though.

20:34.858 --> 20:37.861
There are some things
I'd rather not put in writing.

20:37.945 --> 20:41.281
You felt the same way
about Blake bribing judges.

20:42.449 --> 20:45.535
-What happened to the story I gave you?
-It evolved.

20:45.619 --> 20:47.996
Either way, it brought Daniels down.

20:48.080 --> 20:51.792
It didn't touch Blake.
Now he's coming after my father again.

20:51.875 --> 20:55.045
-What?
-A guard at North State Correctional

20:55.128 --> 20:59.549
shanked himself and said my dad did it,
the day before his parole hearing.

20:59.633 --> 21:03.553
My father's been there 11 years,
never had a problem with anyone.

21:03.637 --> 21:07.849
-And you think Blake paid this guy?
-Blake sent my father to prison.

21:07.933 --> 21:11.937
He's pulled strings to keep him there.
I know he's behind this.

21:12.521 --> 21:16.024
I'm no friend of Blake's,
but you don't have any proof.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.567
Isn't that your job?

21:18.986 --> 21:20.654
The guard is Randall Oakley.

21:22.864 --> 21:25.575
I'll see what I can find.
Even if you're right,

21:25.659 --> 21:29.371
even if I could prove it...
it's not gonna be before tomorrow.

-[hostess] And your own full bar.

22:21.214 --> 22:24.301
Anything you need,

22:24.885 --> 22:27.554
I've been here before,
but this is next level.

22:28.346 --> 22:29.306
Sam did good.

22:29.806 --> 22:31.308
So, what are we drinking?

22:37.814 --> 22:39.149
[phone ringing]

22:43.904 --> 22:45.238
[phone buzzing]

22:52.496 --> 22:54.122
[dance music playing]

23:01.129 --> 23:05.842
Okay. This might be the sake talking,
but do you think heaven looks like this?

23:05.926 --> 23:10.222
I'll never know what heaven looks like,
but this is the best girls' night.

23:10.972 --> 23:13.433
-To girls' night.
-To the girl boss.

23:13.517 --> 23:15.393
Oh, I'll drink to that.

23:17.354 --> 23:22.776
I mean, Jeff's great, obviously.
But I've always wanted my own company.

23:22.859 --> 23:25.862
While other kids were
drawing rainbows and unicorns,

23:25.946 --> 23:30.492
-I was workshopping my letterhead.
-I know. I'm proud of you, Fallon.

23:31.284 --> 23:35.372
And a little jealous. I mean,
not of your warped childhood obviously.

23:35.455 --> 23:38.500
-Obviously.
-Don't get me wrong, I love my brother.

23:38.583 --> 23:41.837
I'm grateful for everything
he's done for our whole family,

23:41.920 --> 23:44.297
Sometimes I feel
like I owe him everything.

23:44.381 --> 23:46.341
I don't have anything that's mine.

23:48.426 --> 23:50.262
You could have this place.

23:50.846 --> 23:53.014
-Seriously.
-Okay. You're drunk.

23:53.098 --> 23:56.852
I bought it for you, no strings.
It's not mine, not Jeff's.

23:56.935 --> 23:58.728
-Fallon, you can't.
-Why not?

23:58.812 --> 24:02.190
You've said you wanted
your own club since high school.

24:02.274 --> 24:05.569
I know you always think I'm not listening.
I'm listening.

24:07.779 --> 24:11.158
Wanna go hang with the real people?
For old times' sake?

24:12.409 --> 24:13.618

24:22.335 --> 24:23.879
Good timing. Check.

24:23.962 --> 24:28.341
Mr. Oakley is in stable condition
in Northeast Georgia Medical Center.

24:28.425 --> 24:31.428
-Expected to make a full recovery.
-That's good news.

24:32.304 --> 24:33.513
You need some.

24:34.514 --> 24:35.390
[knocking on door]

24:36.892 --> 24:37.976
Can I talk to you?

24:44.065 --> 24:47.652
-Who's Randall Oakley?
-What are you talking about?

24:47.736 --> 24:50.405
A guard at
North State Correctional Facility

24:50.488 --> 24:53.325
who was apparently stabbed
by Cecil Colby today.

24:55.285 --> 24:56.828
Where is this coming from?

24:57.204 --> 24:59.289
You do know what I'm talking about.

25:00.582 --> 25:03.710
Paul Daniels was the judge
in Cecil Colby's case.

25:03.793 --> 25:07.464
Stansfield recommended against parole
every time Colby came up.

25:07.547 --> 25:11.551
-Cecil Colby should be in prison.
-That's what courts are for, Blake.

25:11.635 --> 25:13.386
You can't be judge and jury.

25:13.470 --> 25:17.057
-You sound like Steven.
-Good. That's why I'm supporting him.

25:17.515 --> 25:19.184
Cecil tried to kill me.

25:19.267 --> 25:20.977
What? When?

25:21.061 --> 25:24.147
Eleven years ago,
he said I had an affair with his wife.

25:24.231 --> 25:25.690
-Did you?
-Of course not.

25:26.816 --> 25:31.196
The man was crazy. He still is.
Who knows what he'd do if he got out?

25:34.991 --> 25:38.411
-There's nothing I can do for you.
-You're gonna sit back,

25:38.495 --> 25:42.874
-knowing my father was framed?
-I don't know that. You don't know that.

25:42.958 --> 25:46.461
It's hard for a child
to see their parent go through this.

25:46.544 --> 25:50.298
You were hoping that he was
gonna be released, that he changed.

25:50.382 --> 25:51.508
He has changed.

25:51.591 --> 25:54.719
Like I said... nothing I can do.

25:56.221 --> 25:57.973
I've got to get back to work.

25:58.056 --> 26:00.725
What does our fine government
pay you anyway?

26:02.310 --> 26:03.520
I could triple it.

26:04.980 --> 26:09.693
-You'll never have to work again.
-You trying to bribe me? That's a felony.

26:09.776 --> 26:12.320
I'm trying to save my father. [scoffs]

26:13.029 --> 26:14.698
Everyone has a price.

26:19.494 --> 26:22.330
Are you coming or what?
Popcorn's getting cold.

26:23.039 --> 26:24.040
[knocking on door]

26:24.791 --> 26:25.917
Did you order food?

26:31.298 --> 26:32.632
-Ted?
-Sam.

26:32.716 --> 26:34.175
What are you doing here?

26:34.759 --> 26:37.220
I live here. Aren't you in rehab?

26:37.846 --> 26:38.722
Ted.

26:39.931 --> 26:42.183
-Is everything okay?
-Oh, heh.

26:42.267 --> 26:43.351
Yeah. I--

26:43.435 --> 26:46.980
I couldn't find my wallet.
I thought I left it here earlier.

26:47.063 --> 26:48.773
Well, that's a classic.

26:49.441 --> 26:51.860
-Sam, is something burning?
-It's popcorn.

26:51.943 --> 26:54.237
I hate that microwave popcorn.

26:54.863 --> 26:56.156
Okay, I'll check.

26:57.824 --> 27:00.410
I don't think I've seen your wallet,
but I--

27:00.493 --> 27:03.038
Don't worry.
I'm sure it's gonna pop up.

27:04.039 --> 27:07.334
I am sorry to bother you.
I didn't realize you two were--

27:07.417 --> 27:09.878
Oh, no, no. We're just roommates.

27:10.337 --> 27:12.047
Cable ain't cheap, you know.

27:12.130 --> 27:14.549
I'm a drug addict, Steven, not an idiot.

27:14.632 --> 27:17.802
Look, when you asked me
to come over today and--

27:17.886 --> 27:20.180
You talked about
turning over a new leaf.

27:20.263 --> 27:23.099
You were asking me
to help out on your campaign.

27:24.100 --> 27:25.810
I mean, something was there.

27:25.894 --> 27:28.646
Ted, I think we've had
a misunderstanding.

27:30.065 --> 27:32.400
All those things
I said today are true.

27:32.484 --> 27:35.945
I care about you, I really do,
but I think right now

27:36.529 --> 27:40.742
we both need to focus on turning over
our own leaves, you know?

27:40.825 --> 27:43.036
Yeah. No, of course.

27:43.703 --> 27:44.996
My mistake.

27:45.914 --> 27:46.915
Enjoy your movie.

27:54.130 --> 27:57.300
[Fallon] Isn't this better
than being mortal enemies?

27:57.384 --> 28:00.136
I kind of miss you
drowning me in the sprinklers.

28:00.220 --> 28:03.556
-Sorry about that.
-You don't play with a girl's hair.

28:04.140 --> 28:07.310
To be honest,
I had written you off until last night.

28:07.394 --> 28:10.772
Nothing like sexual harassment
to bring women together.

28:11.064 --> 28:12.399
Actually, it was Jeff.

28:13.566 --> 28:15.944
-He asked me to make up with you.
-What?

28:17.112 --> 28:19.364
He knew how upset you were
about what happened between us.

28:19.447 --> 28:21.282
He wants you to be happy.

28:23.243 --> 28:25.954
Why do you think he's letting you
buy him out?

28:28.373 --> 28:30.458
He bought you a ring, Fallon.

28:32.419 --> 28:33.753
He's in love with you.

28:34.379 --> 28:35.755
He always has been.

28:44.556 --> 28:47.559
I got your text.
Is everything okay? Where's Monica?

28:48.768 --> 28:51.604
Why are you letting me
buy you out of Morell Corp?

28:52.355 --> 28:55.150
-I thought that's what you wanted.
-Well, it is.

28:55.233 --> 28:56.651
It's not what you want.

28:56.735 --> 29:00.989
You've been tying it up for weeks
with your lawyers, dragging your feet.

29:01.281 --> 29:03.700
So, why did you say yes?
What changed?

29:04.451 --> 29:06.119
Oh, God. Uh...

29:06.202 --> 29:07.829
What did Monica say to you?

29:08.371 --> 29:09.289
Well...

29:10.331 --> 29:14.043
she said you were in love with me,
which is insane, obviously.

29:15.837 --> 29:16.963
Is it?

29:18.298 --> 29:22.260
Every time I get involved with you,
I end up in nothing but trouble.

29:23.303 --> 29:27.182
Well, you also end up with money,
lots and lots of money.

29:29.934 --> 29:32.145
I remember the first time I saw you...

29:32.937 --> 29:35.815
at one of my
Penley basketball games with Monica.

29:36.024 --> 29:39.986
All white sunglasses,
high-waisted jeans, red lipstick.

29:40.069 --> 29:41.654
My Chloë Sevigny period.

29:42.238 --> 29:44.365
I knew I had to get your attention.

29:45.408 --> 29:48.912
I have been trying
to get your attention ever since.

29:48.995 --> 29:53.708
When you said you wanted to buy me out,
I was afraid I was gonna lose you.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.253
You have my attention now.

29:58.546 --> 30:02.592
But I finally realized...
you can't make someone love you back.

30:04.302 --> 30:06.596
You can't will it into existence.

30:08.431 --> 30:10.183
If it's meant to be, it'll be.

30:16.147 --> 30:18.566
Did Monica tell you about this?

30:20.109 --> 30:21.402
She did actually.

30:21.486 --> 30:24.447
My sister drinking and talking
should be illegal.

30:24.531 --> 30:27.784
Though, in my defense,
I tried to tell you first.

30:28.868 --> 30:33.081
I tried to give this to you...
right before you broke up with me.

30:34.958 --> 30:38.878
But as long as we're laying it
all out there... here it is.

30:44.509 --> 30:47.971
And it's still yours... if you want it.

30:48.638 --> 30:51.808
-Jeff, I--
-You don't have to decide right now.

30:52.433 --> 30:54.227
In fact, I don't want you to.

30:55.144 --> 30:59.107
I heard you when you said you needed
to figure things out for yourself.

31:01.776 --> 31:03.486
And I'll wait for you...

31:04.445 --> 31:06.531
as long as you need.

31:11.995 --> 31:13.121
<i>♪ You came to me ♪</i>

31:15.623 --> 31:18.543
<i>♪ Just like a storm through the trees ♪</i>

31:19.460 --> 31:20.962
<i>♪ Dirt on my feet ♪</i>

31:23.214 --> 31:24.257
Sorry about that.

31:25.258 --> 31:26.634
I got a little tied up.

31:29.345 --> 31:30.930
But I'm all yours now.

31:32.056 --> 31:35.351
<i>♪ No one else does it better than you ♪</i>

31:36.936 --> 31:39.147
<i>♪ How do you do, do, do it? ♪</i>

31:43.234 --> 31:45.361
You know what,
let's lose the flowers.

31:45.445 --> 31:49.657
We're trying to project more "grassroots,"
less "in-house florist."

31:50.241 --> 31:53.953
Lady of the manor, huh? I remember
when we thought IMAX was a splurge.

31:54.037 --> 31:55.288
[chuckles]

31:57.415 --> 31:59.083
Steven, right on time.

31:59.167 --> 32:02.587
-I wanted you to meet Rick Morales.
-Good to meet you, Steven.

32:02.670 --> 32:04.631
Cristal speaks the world of you.

32:04.714 --> 32:06.257
-Thank you for doing this.
-Of course.

32:06.341 --> 32:09.260
I'd love to jump in
so it doesn't feel rehearsed.

32:09.844 --> 32:11.679
It looks like they're ready.

32:12.805 --> 32:16.517
We'll be live-streaming on
the <i>Mirror's</i> website and social media.

32:16.601 --> 32:20.563
Which means no way to
edit my questions or your answers.

32:20.647 --> 32:22.899
I guess I better not screw up, then.

32:25.068 --> 32:25.985
Speeding.

32:26.653 --> 32:30.156
Rick Morales, with Atlanta's
newest candidate for city council,

32:30.239 --> 32:31.324
Steven Carrington.

32:31.783 --> 32:34.494
-Thank you for joining us.
-Thanks for having me.

32:34.577 --> 32:37.789
I think many Atlanta voters
may have a preconceived idea

32:37.872 --> 32:40.333
of what a Carrington candidacy looks like.

32:40.416 --> 32:43.127
What are you hoping to achieve
by running for local government?

32:43.211 --> 32:46.881
I can imagine what people might think
when they hear my last name.

32:46.965 --> 32:49.550
Oil, money, oil money.

32:49.717 --> 32:54.472
I love my family, but I've also never
hesitated to call out Carrington Atlantic

32:54.555 --> 32:56.599
when I disagree with their policies.

32:56.683 --> 33:01.145
I'm serious about making sure
everyone gets to enjoy our beautiful city.

33:01.229 --> 33:04.691
You have a history of substance abuse
including rehab in 2013.

33:04.774 --> 33:08.695
What would you say to Atlantans
concerned you're not up to the job?

33:09.362 --> 33:12.156
I think Oscar Wilde
said it better than I could:

33:12.240 --> 33:15.326
"Experience is simply the name
we give our mistakes."

33:15.702 --> 33:17.954
I made mine early and often.

33:18.287 --> 33:22.041
And I can't change my past,
but I can learn from it, and I have.

33:33.052 --> 33:35.972
The parole hearing of
Cecil Baldwin Colby's in order.

33:36.055 --> 33:39.809
This is the fourth hearing
for prisoner number 2F529.

33:40.768 --> 33:45.273
Mr. Colby, you organized a crime in which
you were in possession of narcotics

33:45.356 --> 33:47.275
with the intent to distribute.

33:47.358 --> 33:50.069
You have been incarcerated
for almost 11 years.

33:50.153 --> 33:53.698
And for almost 11 years,
you have maintained exemplary behavior.

33:55.616 --> 33:58.953
However,
in light of the ongoing investigation

33:59.579 --> 34:02.540
to the serious injury
of a guard yesterday,

34:02.623 --> 34:06.419
this board cannot in good conscience
recommend your release.

34:07.795 --> 34:09.964
Therefore, at this time,

34:10.047 --> 34:13.259
the board votes
unanimously against parole.

34:38.784 --> 34:39.744
Thank you.

34:48.795 --> 34:51.005
-Thank you for doing this.
-Of course.

34:54.175 --> 34:57.845
-I thought you'd gone into the office.
-No. I was working here.

34:57.929 --> 35:00.348
I heard some of Steven's interview.

35:00.807 --> 35:02.934
-And?
-He may not share my politics,

35:03.017 --> 35:05.728
but he handled himself
like a Carrington today.

35:06.270 --> 35:08.731
-You should tell him that.
-I will.

35:10.066 --> 35:13.486
I owe you an apology...
for the way I reacted.

35:13.569 --> 35:15.571
I was just surprised, I guess.

35:16.280 --> 35:18.032
We all know you hate surprises.

35:18.741 --> 35:20.827
There have been a lot of them lately.

35:21.035 --> 35:25.331
-I've always had my world under control.
-It can be scary to lose control.

35:25.540 --> 35:27.166
It can also be liberating.

35:28.543 --> 35:32.463
-I can't afford to find out.
-Of course you can. You of all people can.

35:32.547 --> 35:34.257
I thought the same thing once.

35:34.340 --> 35:37.510
-I had to learn the hard way.
-It's not the same thing.

35:37.677 --> 35:41.597
I'm glad Steven has you in his corner,
politics or otherwise.

35:42.598 --> 35:44.267
I'm glad I have you in mine.

35:59.115 --> 36:00.116
Who died?

36:00.825 --> 36:06.080
In light of the incident with Mr. Oakley,
the board voted to deny parole.

36:07.415 --> 36:11.460
-That sounds like good news.
-The commissioner overruled that decision.

36:11.544 --> 36:13.171
Cecil Colby's being released.

36:23.514 --> 36:26.309
I'm never the first one here.
Where have you been?

36:27.143 --> 36:29.103
I didn't get much sleep last night.

36:29.729 --> 36:32.481
I tried calling.
Something's up with your phone.

36:32.565 --> 36:33.441
Yeah.

36:34.066 --> 36:36.444
Sam tried forwarding
my calls or something.

36:36.527 --> 36:40.615
He has zero actual office skills
but does have great taste in male models.

36:41.407 --> 36:44.744
-I didn't sleep much either.
-Because of the male models?

36:45.995 --> 36:47.288
Because of you.

36:48.039 --> 36:51.792
And how stupid it is to let emotions
influence business decisions.

36:51.876 --> 36:54.503
That's like
introductory business strategy.

36:54.587 --> 36:59.175
But the point is...
you caught me off guard last night.

36:59.884 --> 37:01.219
Yeah, I wasn't...

37:01.886 --> 37:04.680
exactly planning for it
to happen that way.

37:05.598 --> 37:06.724
Me either.

37:07.475 --> 37:08.768
But I thought about it.

37:09.560 --> 37:12.521
About the fact you
came into this company for me.

37:12.730 --> 37:16.359
That you'd walk away for me.
How you helped save my life.

37:18.402 --> 37:21.239
And how you wanted to marry me,
even with bangs.

37:24.116 --> 37:27.536
I know you told me that
I could take all the time I needed.

37:28.621 --> 37:30.039
But I don't need it.

37:34.043 --> 37:35.336
Let's do this.

37:40.800 --> 37:43.094
I kind of thought
you might kiss me, but--

37:51.143 --> 37:54.355
-Great, Sam. Late for work again.
-Good morning, sunshine.

37:57.525 --> 37:59.819
What are you doing? Where's Steven?

38:00.152 --> 38:04.365
He's at his interview. I watched a few
minutes while you were in the shower.

38:06.325 --> 38:07.994
He's pretty good actually.

38:08.077 --> 38:11.289
But I wanted to talk to you.

38:16.252 --> 38:17.795
[Cristal] Trying to sneak out?

38:19.630 --> 38:23.050
Honestly, this place is so big,
I forgot where I came in.

38:23.843 --> 38:26.929
I'm glad I caught you.
I wanted to thank you for today.

38:27.013 --> 38:28.973
You took a leap of faith on Steven.

38:29.598 --> 38:32.643
Not much of a leap
when I trust your judgment.

38:33.561 --> 38:35.813
You know I did it for you, Cristal.

38:36.772 --> 38:37.815
I know.

38:38.858 --> 38:42.278
I have to admit, I didn't expect much,
but he won me over.

38:42.361 --> 38:44.322
He even impressed Blake.

38:44.405 --> 38:48.075
Don't tell anyone I told you that,
especially not my husband.

38:48.659 --> 38:49.869
I can keep a secret.

38:58.544 --> 38:59.545
[Fallon] Got a minute?

39:00.296 --> 39:03.758
You genetically incapable of knocking
or is that more nurture?

39:03.841 --> 39:07.678
[woman 1] <i>I'm calling from Township</i>
<i>First Bank regarding an exciting offer--</i>

39:07.762 --> 39:10.639
-[man] <i>Jeff, it's Andrew, confirming--</i>
-What's this?

39:10.723 --> 39:13.392
[Monica] <i>Where are you?</i>
<i>I've been trying you all night.</i>

39:13.476 --> 39:17.104
<i>Anyway, I pulled out all the stops,</i>
<i>and I think she fell for it.</i>

39:17.688 --> 39:21.734
<i>I hate lying to her, but I trust you.</i>
<i>So, go get a rock on that finger.</i>

39:23.319 --> 39:26.155
I looked through his files,
I tried his e-mail.

39:26.238 --> 39:28.908
But he doesn't
leave passwords lying around.

39:28.991 --> 39:30.618
He's a tech genius, after all.

39:30.701 --> 39:34.663
Sam, on the other hand, is not.
He tried forwarding calls to his cell,

39:34.747 --> 39:37.041
but forwarded all Jeff's messages to me.

39:39.794 --> 39:42.421
You were right. Jeff's playing me.

39:43.339 --> 39:44.382
And Monica, too.

39:47.426 --> 39:49.428
-Why?
-I'm gonna find out.

39:50.346 --> 39:54.308
And once I do... Jeff Colby is going down.

40:04.402 --> 40:05.403
[in foreign language] Welcome home.

40:06.862 --> 40:08.447
[in foreign language] Dad.

40:09.448 --> 40:10.449
Children.

40:26.257 --> 40:28.426
Ted... are you high?

40:29.427 --> 40:32.638
Don't tell anybody.
I told Steven I was back on the wagon.

40:33.764 --> 40:37.184
Look, I'm sorry that
you're having... issues.

40:37.977 --> 40:42.356
I can call someone if you need me to.
I need to go to work. You need to leave.

40:42.440 --> 40:46.110
Come on. You don't need a job
when you have a Carrington.

40:46.193 --> 40:47.486
We're not together.

40:47.945 --> 40:51.657
If Steven doesn't want you back,
it's not because of me. It's you.

40:52.491 --> 40:55.953
You think I'm so pathetic... don't you?

40:57.121 --> 40:59.665
I think you need help.
I'm calling the police.

40:59.748 --> 41:04.044
Get me out of the way? I'm sure that
would make you and Steven happy.

41:04.128 --> 41:05.713
Go ahead. Call the cops.

41:06.589 --> 41:11.719
