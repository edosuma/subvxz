WEBVTT

00:07.608 --> 00:08.707
PROSECUTOR: But you
weren't actually there

00:08.709 --> 00:09.775
when your daughter
died, were you?

00:09.777 --> 00:11.110
No.

00:11.112 --> 00:13.245
You said yourself,
Frank has a temper.

00:13.247 --> 00:14.713
(sigh) Everyone gets
frustrated sometimes.

00:14.715 --> 00:16.615
Not everybody
punches walls.

00:16.617 --> 00:19.585
Tell me again, why did your
husband punch the wall?

00:19.587 --> 00:21.587
He was tired, it was work--

00:21.589 --> 00:23.489
He was tired like the night
that your daughter died?

00:23.491 --> 00:25.391
I didn't say that.
He was alone

00:25.393 --> 00:26.392
with your baby.

00:26.394 --> 00:27.726
She was crying.

00:27.728 --> 00:29.144
She wouldn't stop.

00:29.145 --> 00:30.561
Now isn't it possible that,
in his frustration,

00:30.564 --> 00:32.164
Frank picked up
your baby girl...

00:32.166 --> 00:37.102
that he picked up Taylor
and he shook her.

00:37.104 --> 00:39.071
Now, isn't that possible,
Mrs. McCormick?

00:39.073 --> 00:40.606
(gasps, sobs)

00:40.608 --> 00:42.274
Yes.

00:42.276 --> 00:43.642
Yes what?

00:43.644 --> 00:46.445
(sighs)

00:46.447 --> 00:48.313
Yes, it's possible.

00:53.187 --> 00:54.186
DARREN:
Listen to me.

00:54.188 --> 00:55.454
FRANK:
That son of a bitch.

00:55.456 --> 00:56.956
He twisted
everything she said.

00:56.957 --> 00:58.457
It was a mistake to
put Kerry on the stand.

00:58.459 --> 00:59.792
She's my wife!
DARREN:
It hurt the case.

00:59.794 --> 01:02.094
You need to start
preparing yourself.

01:02.096 --> 01:03.695
I am not going to jail!

01:03.697 --> 01:05.681
You need to get your head
together; show some remorse.

01:05.682 --> 01:07.666
I am not going to let you
do it, you son of a bitch!

01:07.668 --> 01:08.667
Hey, come on.
Let's go.

01:08.669 --> 01:09.802
Kerry! Kerry!

01:09.804 --> 01:11.837
Come on, sir.
Come on.

01:14.208 --> 01:15.741
Kerry!

01:30.624 --> 01:32.624
It gets easier.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.593
Being separated
from your girl.

01:37.164 --> 01:39.748
Yeah.

01:39.749 --> 01:42.333
Conjugals, right?
Voss. No talking.

01:42.336 --> 01:45.771
How long you
going away for?
GUARD: Voss, what'd I tell you?

01:45.773 --> 01:47.706
Hey, my buddy
here's upset.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.775
(tire screeches,
then blows out)

01:49.777 --> 01:52.845
(tires screeching)

02:03.257 --> 02:04.423
Anyone hurt?

02:04.425 --> 02:05.757
(muffled):
What happened? Open up.

02:11.532 --> 02:12.598
You made it.

02:12.600 --> 02:13.832
Have I ever let
you down before?

02:13.834 --> 02:14.900
Whoo!

02:14.902 --> 02:17.836
You comin'?

02:25.146 --> 02:27.913
Really? I bought
ice cream last night.

02:27.915 --> 02:30.382
Sophie, I'm not giving
you a hard time.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.217
Look, you are pregnant,
you are beautiful,

02:32.219 --> 02:34.553
and you should eat
whatever you want.

02:34.555 --> 02:36.889
Send Clark out to
get some more, it's...

02:36.891 --> 02:37.789
I gotta go.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.758
I gotta go.
I gotta go.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.327
You talking to
Sophie again?

02:42.329 --> 02:43.529
How many times has
she called today?

02:43.531 --> 02:45.631
I lost count.
Which stage is she at?

02:45.633 --> 02:48.167
The "get me this" stage, or the
"do you still love me?" stage?

02:48.169 --> 02:49.218
(laughs)

02:49.219 --> 02:50.268
Or the "I'm fat and it's
your fault" stage?

02:50.271 --> 02:51.603
WORDY:
It's worth it.

02:51.605 --> 02:52.905
Once you hold 'em in your arms
for the first time.

02:52.907 --> 02:53.906
Yeah.

02:53.908 --> 02:55.274
WINNIE:
Team One, hot call.

02:55.276 --> 02:56.325
Armed prisoners escaped

02:56.326 --> 02:57.375
from a transport van.
Where?

02:57.378 --> 02:58.777
Leslie and Eastern.

02:58.779 --> 02:59.645
How many on board?

02:59.647 --> 03:00.812
Two prisoners.

03:00.814 --> 03:01.880
They escaped
with an unknown accomplice.

03:01.882 --> 03:02.814
Issue a city-wide alert.

03:02.816 --> 03:04.183
Get me a manifest for that van.

03:04.185 --> 03:05.717
Need to know who
we're dealing with.

03:05.719 --> 03:07.886
Getting that for you right now.

03:07.888 --> 03:09.738
(distant sirens wail)

03:09.739 --> 03:11.589
WINNIE:<i> The escaped</i>
<i> prisoners are Frank McCormick</i>

03:11.592 --> 03:12.791
and Carl Voss.

03:12.793 --> 03:14.393
McCormick. Isn't he
the airline pilot?

03:14.395 --> 03:15.894
Yeah, accused of
killing his baby.

03:15.896 --> 03:18.764
He was headed back to city jail;
his verdict isn't till tomorrow.

03:18.766 --> 03:19.932
What about Voss?

03:19.934 --> 03:21.300
Voss--
Voss committed armed robbery,

03:21.302 --> 03:22.785
assault with a deadly weapon.

03:22.786 --> 03:24.269
He was being transferred
back to Kingston Pen.

03:24.271 --> 03:26.305
Maximum security.
Thanks, Winnie.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.809
Tires are shredded.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.611
Might have something
to do with this.

03:32.613 --> 03:33.679
Spike strip.

03:34.982 --> 03:36.415
This was planned.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.950
Do Voss and McCormick
know each other?

03:37.952 --> 03:39.384
GUARD: Sure
seemed like it.

03:39.386 --> 03:40.485
They were talking.

03:40.487 --> 03:42.254
Thanks.

03:42.256 --> 03:43.922
You think that Voss
and McCormick

03:43.924 --> 03:45.324
are in on
this together?

03:45.326 --> 03:47.893
Well, they're both
looking at serious time.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.261
Hey, Spike,

03:49.263 --> 03:50.629
you got anything on
the van's camera?

03:50.631 --> 03:51.763
Screening the footage now.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.299
(typing)

03:54.301 --> 03:55.901
Okay, here we go:
The three men

03:55.903 --> 03:58.303
left the van heading in
the same direction.

03:58.305 --> 04:00.639
You get an image
of the accomplice?

04:00.641 --> 04:02.007
SPIKE: Just the
back of his head.

04:02.009 --> 04:05.377
Wait a second,
I got a late model sedan

04:05.379 --> 04:06.578
leaving the scene heading south.

04:06.579 --> 04:07.778
Spike, were all three
men in the car?

04:07.781 --> 04:09.848
Tinted windows, hard to tell.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.783
I do have a plate
number, though.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.018
Registered to...?

04:13.020 --> 04:15.821
Rick Marinelli.
Career criminal.

04:15.823 --> 04:18.957
Did some time with Voss, B&Es,
two armed robberies.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.826
Okay, any connection to
McCormick?

04:20.828 --> 04:23.262
Nothing I can see.
McCormick's record's clean.

04:23.264 --> 04:24.429
This is Voss's breakout.

04:24.431 --> 04:26.732
He had his buddy Rick
help him out.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.600
Yeah, and took their new
buddy Frank with them.

04:28.602 --> 04:31.470
Winnie, alert the airports,
train and bus stations.

04:31.472 --> 04:32.871
Emphasis on airports,

04:32.873 --> 04:35.540
both private and commercial--
our guy's a pilot here.

04:35.542 --> 04:37.709
And let's get an APB out
on Rick Marinelli's car.

04:37.711 --> 04:38.977
Copy that.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.412
Spike, look into
Voss and Marinelli.

04:40.414 --> 04:41.680
If this thing is planned,

04:41.682 --> 04:42.981
somebody knows where
they're headed.
Got it.

04:42.983 --> 04:43.982
Let's get these guys.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.851
PARKER:
Okay.

04:45.853 --> 04:48.920
ED: We're gonna start
at the courthouse.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.889
(sirens wailing)

04:50.891 --> 04:52.991
Hey, Winnie, can you patch me
in to McCormick's lawyer?

04:52.993 --> 04:54.510
Coming right up, Jules.

04:54.511 --> 04:56.028
McCormick wasn't expecting
to be freed today.

04:56.030 --> 04:58.030
He's thinking on his feet.
He could've
jacked a car.

04:58.032 --> 04:59.831
Winnie's checking
for any vehicles

04:59.833 --> 05:00.866
reported stolen
this morning.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.000
Jules, any luck on
Frank's lawyer?

05:02.002 --> 05:03.468
She's on the phone
with him now.

05:03.470 --> 05:04.903
Winnie, patch me into
Jules and the lawyer.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.305
You got it.

05:06.307 --> 05:07.906
JULES: Any idea where
he might've gone?

05:07.908 --> 05:10.442
My guess? As far away
from here as possible.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.910
DARREN: He did not want
to go back to jail.

05:11.912 --> 05:12.978
How did Frank's daughter die?

05:12.980 --> 05:13.979
DARREN:
She was six months old.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.798
Frank thought it was SIDS.

05:15.799 --> 05:17.616
Went to check on Taylor,
found her dead in the crib.

05:17.618 --> 05:19.318
DARREN: But the coroner
ruled it a homicide.

05:19.320 --> 05:20.852
Shaken baby syndrome.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.454
Would you say Frank
has a temper?

05:22.456 --> 05:24.856
Look, the guy's angry,
all right?

05:24.858 --> 05:26.458
He feels like he was railroaded.

05:26.460 --> 05:28.660
This prosecutor,
Adrian Hayes, he's a pitbull.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.295
DARREN: He's got a
perfect conviction rate.

05:30.296 --> 05:31.929
Do you think he's angry
enough to want to hurt him?

05:31.932 --> 05:33.965
After this morning,
I wouldn't be surprised.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.467
What happened this morning?

05:35.468 --> 05:36.968
DARREN: I put Frank's
wife on the stand.

05:36.970 --> 05:39.671
I thought if the jury could see
her standing by her husband,

05:39.673 --> 05:40.706
it would help our case,

05:40.708 --> 05:41.940
but Mr. Hayes ripped her apart.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.575
Frank must've been upset.

05:43.577 --> 05:44.943
The bailiff had to restrain him.

05:44.945 --> 05:46.745
SPIKE:
<i> Boss, I got a lead.</i>

05:46.747 --> 05:48.580
Yeah, Spike.

05:48.582 --> 05:49.981
Found a boat registered to
Rick Marinelli's brother.

05:49.983 --> 05:52.384
He keeps it docked
at Ashbridge's Bay.

05:52.386 --> 05:53.885
Good way to get out of town.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.854
Dump the car, head for
international waters.

05:55.856 --> 05:56.988
Change of plans.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.590
Team One, head south
to the lakeshore.

05:58.592 --> 05:59.991
Ashbridge's Bay Marina.

05:59.993 --> 06:01.727
<i> Taking Lisbon Street.</i>

06:01.729 --> 06:04.396
WORDY:
<i> Following you, Sam.</i>

06:04.398 --> 06:06.498
ED:
<i> Stay alert, eyes sharp.</i>

06:06.500 --> 06:08.133
PARKER:<i> We're coming</i>
<i> in from the south.</i>

06:13.107 --> 06:14.139
Got a sighting
on the vehicle.

06:14.141 --> 06:16.108
Where?
Cherry Street, southbound.

06:16.110 --> 06:17.876
All right, we're
coming north.

06:22.816 --> 06:25.150
SAM: Ed, he's heading
right to ya.

06:25.152 --> 06:26.752
ED:
I'll try to head him off.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.720
(tires screeching)

06:32.493 --> 06:34.693
(engine roars)

06:34.695 --> 06:37.562
We get 'em to the lake,
they've got nowhere to go.

06:55.949 --> 06:58.617
This is the Police
Strategic Response Unit!

06:58.619 --> 07:01.787
Turn off the engines
and step out of the car, now!

07:01.789 --> 07:04.689
(car engine revs)

07:04.691 --> 07:08.727
Turn off the engine and
step out of the car, now!

07:08.729 --> 07:11.062
Let's do it.

07:11.064 --> 07:13.865
Step out of the car now!
Turn the engine off!

07:13.867 --> 07:17.035
Cut the engine!
Out of the vehicle, now!

07:17.037 --> 07:20.005
Step out of the car, now!
Hands where we can see 'em!

07:20.007 --> 07:21.973
JULES: Open the door!
Get out of the car, now!

07:21.975 --> 07:23.708
Here he comes, Jules.
Open the door, now!

07:23.710 --> 07:25.076
Open the door, slowly!

07:25.078 --> 07:27.145
Get out now!
Get out, get out of the car.

07:27.147 --> 07:28.180
Hands where I can see 'em.

07:28.182 --> 07:29.548
Do it now!

07:29.550 --> 07:30.982
(Rick coughing)

07:30.984 --> 07:33.985
We got Voss and
Marinelli in custody.

07:33.987 --> 07:36.021
McCormick's not in the car.

07:36.023 --> 07:36.955
Where is he?

07:36.956 --> 07:37.888
How the hell should I know?

07:37.891 --> 07:38.723
Where is he?

07:38.725 --> 07:39.724
He didn't go with you?

07:39.726 --> 07:40.992
No. Shall I give
you a ride?

07:40.994 --> 07:44.463
These cuffs tight
enough for you?

07:44.465 --> 07:46.164
All right, you let McCormick
out of the van, then what?

07:46.166 --> 07:49.201
He took the guard's
gun and he ran off.

07:52.539 --> 07:56.875
All units be advised, Frank
McCormick is not yet in custody.

07:56.877 --> 08:00.045
He's assumed armed and
considered dangerous.

08:02.649 --> 08:06.718
  Captioning sponsored by
  CBS

08:38.785 --> 08:41.653
(phone ringing inside house)

08:41.655 --> 08:44.122
(phone ringing)

08:51.765 --> 08:52.764
Frank?

08:52.766 --> 08:54.766
What are you
doing here?

08:54.768 --> 08:56.768
Why do you have a gun?

08:56.770 --> 08:58.937
You're packing up
all my stuff already?

08:58.939 --> 09:00.572
It's not yours.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.681
You're getting rid
of her clothes?

09:09.683 --> 09:11.750
I can't keep it
here, I can't.

09:11.752 --> 09:14.252
I can't look at it
every single day.

09:14.254 --> 09:17.822
It's been six
months, Frank.

09:17.824 --> 09:20.091
We should be going through
all this stuff together.

09:20.093 --> 09:24.062
We shouldn't be
doing it at all.

09:25.699 --> 09:27.766
Sorry.

09:28.835 --> 09:30.201
You think I did it.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.816
ED: We got Sam and Jules
on the main floor.

09:44.818 --> 09:47.185
Wordy and Spike
sweeping the second.

09:47.187 --> 09:49.020
Frank's here, we're
gonna find him.
That's good.

09:49.022 --> 09:51.022
ED:
There's the prosecutor.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.791
Mr. Hayes!

09:52.793 --> 09:53.926
What's going on?

09:53.927 --> 09:55.060
Frank McCormick
escaped earlier today.

09:55.062 --> 09:56.461
Yeah, they told me.

09:56.462 --> 09:57.861
Sir, we need to put
you in protective custody.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.633
Okay, fine.
I... I get it.

10:01.635 --> 10:03.379
Thank you, sir.

10:03.380 --> 10:05.124
I understand McCormick
threatened you in court today.

10:05.125 --> 10:06.869
He wasn't happy with
how things turned out.

10:06.873 --> 10:08.740
His lawyer claims
he's innocent.

10:08.742 --> 10:09.874
Innocent men
don't run.

10:09.876 --> 10:11.710
I've got the top
coroner in this country

10:11.712 --> 10:13.211
telling me that this guy
shook his baby.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.747
Even McCormick's own wife
thinks he did it.

10:15.749 --> 10:18.383
McCormick's lawyer said
she testified on his behalf.

10:18.385 --> 10:20.218
Yeah.
Didn't turn out that way.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.219
KERRY:
He was tired.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.688
Did your husband
want this child?

10:23.690 --> 10:24.990
Of course he did.

10:24.992 --> 10:26.625
Was he happy when
you told him

10:26.627 --> 10:27.892
that you were pregnant?

10:28.829 --> 10:30.128
Was he happy?

10:30.130 --> 10:32.230
Mrs. McCormick,

10:32.232 --> 10:34.699
tell me again, why did
your husband punch the wall?

10:34.701 --> 10:36.701
He was tired, it was work--

10:36.703 --> 10:38.970
He was tired like the night
that your daughter died?

10:41.174 --> 10:42.941
The seed of doubt
was already there.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.109
I just exposed it.

10:44.111 --> 10:45.910
SAM: He's not
in the building.

10:45.912 --> 10:47.012
Thank you, Mr. Hayes.

10:47.014 --> 10:48.313
Mr. Hayes,
we're gonna get you

10:48.315 --> 10:49.914
to go with
these two officers here.

10:49.916 --> 10:51.916
All right.

10:51.918 --> 10:53.585
What's going on?

10:53.586 --> 10:55.253
McCormick's wife turned
on him in court today.

10:55.255 --> 10:56.988
Okay, Team One,
let's move.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.191
Frank's wife
may be in danger.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.094
KERRY:<i> Hi, you've reached</i>
<i> the McCormicks.</i>

11:03.096 --> 11:04.829
<i> Leave us a message</i>
<i> after the beep.</i>

11:06.166 --> 11:08.233
Winnie, I can't get through on
the McCormicks' home line.

11:08.235 --> 11:10.268
It keeps going to voicemail.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.970
I know, we've got a
911 in progress.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.104
PARKER:
Patch it through.

11:13.106 --> 11:15.040
Coming right up.

11:15.042 --> 11:16.425
This is Sergeant Greg Parker

11:16.426 --> 11:17.809
with the Police Strategic
Response Unit,

11:17.811 --> 11:19.878
Mrs. McCormick.

11:22.949 --> 11:24.249
PARKER:
She's not responding.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.119
(sirens wailing)

11:47.841 --> 11:49.207
You got it?
Yep.

12:00.153 --> 12:04.255
ED:
Bravo Team in three, two, one...

12:05.292 --> 12:06.391
Police! Police!

12:06.393 --> 12:08.059
Police! SRU!
Police!

12:08.061 --> 12:10.061
SRU!
Police!

12:10.063 --> 12:11.129
Police!

12:11.998 --> 12:13.098
Clear.

12:17.804 --> 12:18.870
Clear.

12:20.006 --> 12:22.040
Clear.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.142
Eddie.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.479
Yeah. Yeah.

12:27.481 --> 12:28.947
Garage is empty.

12:31.184 --> 12:33.051
He took her.

12:36.189 --> 12:39.758
Just keep going straight.

12:39.760 --> 12:44.028
Frank, the police
are looking for you.

12:44.030 --> 12:45.530
You should
turn yourself in.

12:45.532 --> 12:48.533
They stack us three
to a cell, three feet wide.

12:48.535 --> 12:51.136
I get the floor.

12:51.138 --> 12:52.587
My head's next to a toilet,

12:52.588 --> 12:54.037
but that's not why
I don't sleep at night.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.074
You know
what they do to people

12:56.076 --> 12:57.342
that are accused
of killing kids?

12:57.344 --> 12:59.978
The thing that kept me
going all this time...

12:59.980 --> 13:03.915
was knowing that
you still believed in me.

13:03.917 --> 13:06.217
That no matter what
anybody else said,

13:06.219 --> 13:07.385
you believed in me.

13:07.387 --> 13:10.054
You knew the truth.

13:10.056 --> 13:11.990
What I said in court...

13:11.992 --> 13:13.124
What you said in court

13:13.126 --> 13:15.226
you can't take back!

13:18.131 --> 13:21.065
Winnie, we need to put out an
APB on Kerry McCormick's car.

13:21.067 --> 13:24.102
WINNIE: Copy that.
Well, if he was gonna hurt her,
he'd have done it here.

13:24.104 --> 13:26.121
Unless he caught
her dialing 911.

13:26.122 --> 13:28.139
Spike, you pick
anything off that 911?
(Eddie's PDA rings)

13:28.141 --> 13:29.140
SPIKE:
Working on it.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.409
Everything okay?

13:31.411 --> 13:33.044
Soph, you need to rest.

13:33.046 --> 13:35.213
You shouldn't be
on your feet so much.

13:35.215 --> 13:36.948
Sophie, I gotta go.
I'll call you later.

13:36.950 --> 13:38.049
Okay, bye.

13:38.050 --> 13:39.149
Kerry didn't talk
to the operator,

13:39.150 --> 13:40.249
but she left the phone
on the whole time.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.420
I boosted the gain
so we got something.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.322
JULES:
Can you turn it up?
Yep.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.124
KERRY:
What was I supposed to think?

13:46.126 --> 13:47.392
FRANK:
I told you I didn't do it!

13:47.394 --> 13:49.093
KERRY:
What about what the doctor said?

13:49.095 --> 13:51.362
FRANK: You believed her?
KERRY: She's an expert!

13:51.364 --> 13:54.065
FRANK:
Where are your car keys?

13:54.067 --> 13:55.133
KERRY:
Here. Take them, go.

13:55.135 --> 13:56.367
FRANK:
You're coming with me.

13:56.369 --> 13:59.437
KERRY: No, Frank. Let go!
FRANK: Come on!

13:59.439 --> 14:01.272
Frank's lawyer said that
there were two doctors

14:01.274 --> 14:03.308
involved with the case.

14:03.309 --> 14:05.343
There was the, uh, the ER doctor
who prounced the baby dead,

14:05.345 --> 14:07.145
and the coroner who
performed the autopsy.

14:07.147 --> 14:08.613
Both lawyers mentioned
the coroner's testimony.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.248
The wife called her an expert.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.116
"The top forensic
pathologist in the country."

14:12.118 --> 14:14.185
And her testimony helped turn
his own wife against him.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.087
Maybe Frank's looking for
payback.

14:16.089 --> 14:17.656
What's the name of that coroner?

14:17.657 --> 14:19.224
Dr. Roberta Fenton; her office
is at the city morgue.

14:19.226 --> 14:20.892
All right,
let's get moving.

14:20.894 --> 14:22.560
Winnie, patch me through
to security

14:22.562 --> 14:24.062
at the Coroner's Office.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.269
(phone ringing)

14:31.271 --> 14:32.954
Security.

14:32.955 --> 14:34.638
This is Ed Lane, with the
Police Strategic Response Unit.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.007
Is Dr. Fenton
in the building?

14:36.009 --> 14:38.376
Yes.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.045
Okay, we have reason to believe
that an escaped prisoner

14:41.047 --> 14:42.480
named Frank McCormick
may be looking for her.

14:42.482 --> 14:43.481
I see.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.216
Subject's
a white male, 30s,

14:45.218 --> 14:47.318
may be accompanied
by a white female
the same age.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.620
Any sign of them?

14:48.622 --> 14:50.021
Have you seen them?

14:50.023 --> 14:52.190
GUARD: Actually,
I think I see them now.

14:52.192 --> 14:53.208
ED:
Okay, stay calm.

14:53.209 --> 14:54.225
If you can
stall him, do so.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.194
But the priority
here is to cooperate.

14:56.196 --> 14:57.896
He's armed and
emotionally unstable.

14:57.898 --> 15:00.164
We're on our way.

15:00.166 --> 15:03.034
Thank you very much.

15:03.036 --> 15:04.369
Can I help you?

15:11.478 --> 15:13.544
(sirens wail)

15:20.987 --> 15:22.553
Wait a sec,
what's down here?

15:22.555 --> 15:24.355
Oh, nothing.
It's just labs.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.524
You know, uh,maybe we should
check out the third floor.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.092
This says "autopsy."

15:28.094 --> 15:30.495
This, uh, we,
we don't even use...

15:31.564 --> 15:33.398
Autopsy. Now.

15:42.208 --> 15:44.208
That's her.
That's Dr. Fenton.

15:44.210 --> 15:45.109
Open it.

15:45.111 --> 15:47.512
Open it!

15:49.082 --> 15:51.149
(keys jangle)

15:53.219 --> 15:54.986
FENTON:
Okay, it's safe to assume

15:54.988 --> 15:57.388
those two are connected,
so we'll just...

15:57.390 --> 15:59.490
Frank McCormick?

15:59.492 --> 16:00.658
Back away from the table.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.260
FENTON:
Oh, my God.

16:02.262 --> 16:04.329
Just do what
he says, please.
VALO: What's going on here?

16:04.331 --> 16:06.698
Do it now.
FENTON:
Just.. stay calm.

16:06.700 --> 16:09.434
VALO: Sir! Could you please!
FENTON: Lionel,
try to stay calm.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.605
My wife thinks that
I killed my daughter.

16:14.607 --> 16:17.308
And you're going to
show her that she's wrong.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.010
Mr. McCormick,
I know you're upset...

16:19.012 --> 16:20.011
Don't patronize me.

16:20.013 --> 16:21.446
Sorry.

16:21.448 --> 16:23.514
I want you to go and find my
daughter's autopsy report.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.717
I would like you to take
a very good, close look at it.

16:25.719 --> 16:29.354
And I want you to find the
mistake that you made.

16:29.356 --> 16:30.555
Do it!

16:40.734 --> 16:44.002
Frank, please, you don't
need to do this, this isn't...

16:49.376 --> 16:52.210
Let me see it.
Bring it over here.

16:52.212 --> 16:54.512
It contains autopsy
photos of your daughter

16:54.514 --> 16:56.280
that I didn't
show in court.

16:56.282 --> 16:59.517
It could be very upsetting
for you... and for your wife.

17:03.757 --> 17:07.025
(sighs)

17:13.566 --> 17:15.633
How many people
we got in here?
More than 100.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.568
We got offices
on the upper level,

17:17.570 --> 17:19.270
and the autopsy
suites in the basement.

17:19.272 --> 17:20.772
We need a full evac.
It's underway.

17:20.774 --> 17:23.374
I'm bringing in
more uniforms

17:23.376 --> 17:24.375
to lock down
the perimeter.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.343
This is the guard.

17:25.344 --> 17:26.310
Hey. We talked
on the phone.

17:26.312 --> 17:27.211
Where's
Mr. McCormick now?

17:27.213 --> 17:28.513
Autopsy one,

17:28.515 --> 17:30.181
with the woman he came with
and another coroner.

17:30.183 --> 17:31.716
Sam, Wordy, with me.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.351
Spike, set the command post
up here.

17:33.353 --> 17:34.585
We need blueprints
of the building.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.154
On it.

17:36.156 --> 17:37.488
And a way to communicate
with Mr. McCormick.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.757
The building's equipped
with an intercom system.

17:39.759 --> 17:41.225
I can hook it
into the headsets.

17:41.227 --> 17:42.627
Okay, it'll have to do.

17:42.629 --> 17:45.196
Let's hurry up, guys.
McCormick's hanging by a thread.

17:45.198 --> 17:46.697
He's lost his child, his wife,

17:46.699 --> 17:48.800
and now he's about
to lose his freedom.

18:00.447 --> 18:01.746
Boss, we got a visual.

18:06.319 --> 18:07.552
Got a camera
on the window.

18:09.522 --> 18:11.522
PARKER:
Entry options?

18:11.524 --> 18:13.458
WORDY:
Door's stainless steel.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.326
Too heavy for a ram.

18:15.328 --> 18:16.861
We can't risk
a charge,

18:16.863 --> 18:18.496
not with the chemicals in there.

18:18.498 --> 18:19.730
There's an extensive
air vent system,

18:19.732 --> 18:21.399
one in every room.

18:21.401 --> 18:23.367
You wouldn't know it
from the smell.

18:23.369 --> 18:24.502
Breathe through
your mouth.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.337
I'm uploading blueprints
to your PDAs.

18:29.609 --> 18:33.845
Okay... There's a duct
above the autopsy suite.

18:35.582 --> 18:36.647
Best entry's through the roof.

18:36.649 --> 18:38.649
You're gonna have to rappel.

18:38.651 --> 18:40.551
ED: Okay, Sam, this
can go both ways.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.353
Bring a strobe
and CS gas.

18:42.355 --> 18:43.354
I'm on it.

18:43.356 --> 18:45.223
I'll spot him?
Let's do it.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.563
The CT scan of
your daughter's brain

18:52.565 --> 18:54.565
indicated
severe swelling.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.200
See this area here?

18:56.202 --> 18:59.270
There's a pooling of blood
at the base of her skull.

18:59.272 --> 19:00.738
You must've
mixed up the scans.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.340
This, this is
someone else's.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.541
It's got her
name on it.

19:03.543 --> 19:06.177
As I said in court,
those symptoms,

19:06.179 --> 19:08.146
along with retinal hemorrages,
comprise something called

19:08.148 --> 19:10.181
shaken baby
syndrome triad.

19:10.183 --> 19:11.282
No.
I'm sorry,

19:11.284 --> 19:12.683
I'm very familiar
with the syndrome.

19:12.685 --> 19:15.419
I did not shake my baby!

19:15.421 --> 19:17.922
I wish I had
another explanation.

19:17.924 --> 19:19.390
PARKER (over P.A.):
Frank McCormick.

19:19.392 --> 19:22.493
Greg Parker,
Strategic Response Unit.

19:23.663 --> 19:27.231
I need to make sure
everyone in there is okay.

19:27.233 --> 19:29.600
Talk to him.

19:29.602 --> 19:33.404
VALO:
He can hear you.

19:33.406 --> 19:35.873
I don't need a SWAT team,
I just need some answers.

19:35.875 --> 19:36.874
PARKER:
Okay.

19:36.876 --> 19:38.843
Okay, Frank, I understand that.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.711
But in the eyes
of the law, right now,

19:40.713 --> 19:42.180
you're still an innocent man.

19:42.182 --> 19:43.581
You still stand
a chance at trial.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.583
Nobody believes me.

19:45.585 --> 19:47.752
They only believe the expert.

19:47.754 --> 19:50.688
Sir, is it possible to get
copies of the McCormick files?

19:50.690 --> 19:52.557
Yeah. Uh, they're
in the archives.

19:52.559 --> 19:53.758
Okay, great,
can I see them?
Yeah.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.493
And everything you
have on Dr. Fenton.

19:56.663 --> 19:59.497
Okay, Spike, we're on the roof.
Which vent is it?

19:59.499 --> 20:00.765
You want the main
intake vent, south side.

20:00.767 --> 20:03.267
Copy.

20:05.471 --> 20:07.438
Sam? In position?

20:07.440 --> 20:08.639
We see it.

20:15.782 --> 20:19.617
(drill whirring)

20:19.619 --> 20:22.320
All right... (heavy sigh)

20:22.322 --> 20:24.922
I know it's hard
to lose a child.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.591
FRANK:
It's even harder having

20:26.593 --> 20:29.594
everybody thinking
that you killed her.

20:29.596 --> 20:31.462
Including your wife.

20:31.464 --> 20:32.797
Hard times for both
of you, Frank.

20:32.799 --> 20:34.732
You've both been
through a... a lot.

20:36.603 --> 20:37.768
Line secure?

20:37.770 --> 20:39.537
I gotcha.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.783
I mean, how long
have you been together?

20:52.785 --> 20:54.352
Five years.

20:54.354 --> 20:55.419
Five years?

20:55.421 --> 20:57.455
Five years, you get
to know someone.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.794
First night we met,

21:03.796 --> 21:07.331
she looked me right in the eye

21:07.333 --> 21:11.002
like she already knew me.

21:11.004 --> 21:14.672
And then today on the stand, she
says she doesn't know anymore.

21:14.674 --> 21:16.641
You think I wanted
to believe that?

21:16.643 --> 21:17.875
PARKER:
Kerry, I think Frank just wants

21:17.877 --> 21:19.677
a chance to be heard here.

21:19.679 --> 21:21.579
You made them think
I didn't want her.

21:21.581 --> 21:22.713
You didn't.

21:22.715 --> 21:23.714
Like I didn't want
to get married.

21:23.716 --> 21:25.383
Not at the beginning.

21:25.385 --> 21:27.351
You didn't tell them
the next part.

21:27.353 --> 21:29.920
The part after I held her
in my arms for the first time,

21:29.922 --> 21:32.623
and saw her little chin,

21:32.625 --> 21:38.496
and her, um, eyes that
looked just like yours.

21:38.498 --> 21:40.731
I loved her.
I loved her.

21:40.733 --> 21:42.800
I know.

21:47.006 --> 21:48.639
Almost there.

21:50.610 --> 21:52.543
Hey, Frank, I...

21:52.545 --> 21:54.879
I can tell that you
love your daughter.

21:54.881 --> 21:57.882
I'd like to hear your side.

21:57.884 --> 22:01.052
Can you tell me what
happened the night she died?

22:01.054 --> 22:02.653
(sighs)

22:02.655 --> 22:06.023
I, I was looking after
Taylor because, uh,

22:06.025 --> 22:08.859
Kerry was with her mom
at the hospital.

22:08.861 --> 22:10.828
(baby crying)

22:10.830 --> 22:13.698
<i> I'd just come off</i>
<i> a 14-hour flight;</i>

22:13.700 --> 22:15.866
<i> I didn't realize</i>
<i> how exhausted I was.</i>

22:15.868 --> 22:19.837
<i> Taylor was... She had a cold.</i>

22:19.839 --> 22:22.840
<i> She wouldn't stop crying.</i>

22:22.842 --> 22:26.877
I tried bouncing her, because
she always loved that,

22:26.879 --> 22:28.045
but it didn't work.

22:28.047 --> 22:30.381
<i> Nothing worked.</i>

22:30.383 --> 22:32.850
(Taylor continues crying)

22:32.852 --> 22:35.586
<i> So I tried to</i>
<i> put her in her crib.</i>

22:35.588 --> 22:37.822
<i> Uh, let her</i>
<i> cry it out, you know?</i>

22:37.824 --> 22:39.757
<i> That's what you're supposed</i>
<i> to do, right?</i>

22:39.759 --> 22:41.392
<i> You let'em cry.</i>

22:41.394 --> 22:44.428
(crying continues)

22:44.430 --> 22:47.765
<i> But she wouldn't stop.</i>

22:47.767 --> 22:51.902
I was a wreck: from
the crying, from the flight.

22:51.904 --> 22:53.704
And, uh...

22:53.706 --> 22:55.740
I, I had a glass
of wine.

22:55.742 --> 23:00.778
I dozed off for
maybe half an hour.

23:00.780 --> 23:01.779
(sighs)

23:01.781 --> 23:03.581
And when I woke up it was quiet.

23:06.853 --> 23:09.653
<i> As soon as I went in</i>
<i> to check on her,</i>

23:09.655 --> 23:11.856
<i> I knew that there was</i>
<i> something wrong, I mean...</i>

23:11.858 --> 23:15.092
<i> she wasn't breathing.</i>

23:15.094 --> 23:18.763
I called 911, I tried CPR.

23:20.633 --> 23:22.633
(voice breaking):
Her lips were... cold.

23:26.773 --> 23:28.906
She was gone.

23:30.777 --> 23:35.813
My little girl was gone.

23:40.953 --> 23:42.420
(pained sigh)

23:42.422 --> 23:46.791
She just...stopped breathing.

23:46.793 --> 23:50.127
It <i> had</i> to have been SIDS.

23:50.129 --> 23:52.596
SIDS doesn't cause the
brain to swell and bleed.

23:52.598 --> 23:54.198
Well, something does, right?

23:54.200 --> 23:55.800
Something does!

23:55.802 --> 23:57.902
And it wasn't me!

23:57.904 --> 23:59.804
(feet thud onto floor)

23:59.806 --> 24:01.439
Spike, we've got a problem.

24:01.441 --> 24:02.840
What's that?

24:02.842 --> 24:04.809
The vent to the
autopsy room is blocked.

24:04.811 --> 24:06.510
He'll hear me if I try
to cut through it.

24:06.512 --> 24:08.646
That wasn't in the
original blueprints.

24:08.648 --> 24:11.048
Where else can we gain access?

24:11.050 --> 24:12.750
SPIKE:
There. Histology.
ED:
What is that?

24:12.752 --> 24:14.852
It's where they store and
test blood and tissue samples

24:14.854 --> 24:15.886
for ongoing cases.

24:15.888 --> 24:17.888
Which way, Spike?

24:17.890 --> 24:20.825
Sam, make your way 50 feet along
the duct to the next shaft.

24:20.827 --> 24:22.960
Copy that.

24:25.131 --> 24:28.699
He's questioning the evidence
in his daughter's case.

24:28.701 --> 24:30.534
We tell him
to go to histology,

24:30.536 --> 24:31.836
so that Fenton can
retest the samples.

24:31.838 --> 24:34.104
It would make Frank feel
that we're on his side.

24:34.106 --> 24:35.806
What happens when
the tests are done?

24:35.808 --> 24:37.107
He's not gonna find
what he's looking for.

24:37.109 --> 24:39.009
And he's gonna be a danger
to everybody in there,

24:39.011 --> 24:40.711
he's gonna be
a danger to himself.

24:40.713 --> 24:42.713
Okay, boss, let me do
a face-to-face here.

24:42.715 --> 24:44.715
I can connect with him.

24:44.717 --> 24:45.816
I can keep him grounded.

24:47.854 --> 24:48.953
All right, Eddie.

24:48.955 --> 24:50.821
Okay, I'm gonna
go in unarmed.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.490
PARKER:
No, I don't think so.

24:52.492 --> 24:54.625
Greg, you know how it works.

24:54.627 --> 24:57.161
I'm not gonna earn his trust
walking in there with an Mp5.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.996
I can cover him, boss,

24:58.998 --> 25:01.565
and Ed can give you eyes in.

25:01.567 --> 25:02.833
Okay.

25:02.835 --> 25:06.770
Sam... you don't take
your eyes off of him.

25:06.772 --> 25:07.838
Copy that.

25:12.645 --> 25:14.211
Which way, Spike?

25:14.213 --> 25:16.881
Turn to your right.
Copy that.

25:16.883 --> 25:19.149
How do I know you're not
going to just shoot me

25:19.151 --> 25:20.885
the second I
walk out the door?

25:20.887 --> 25:23.954
We want to resolve
this peacefully, Frank.

25:27.059 --> 25:29.126
Okay.

25:30.062 --> 25:32.863
Thank you, Frank.

25:34.901 --> 25:36.901
Dr. Fenton can handle
the re-testing,

25:36.903 --> 25:39.103
so why don't you let
Kerry and Dr. Valo go?

25:39.105 --> 25:41.739
No, I'm going to make
everybody stay with me.

25:41.741 --> 25:44.108
I want<i> him </i>
to check the results,

25:44.110 --> 25:46.110
'cause I'd like
a second opinion.

25:48.581 --> 25:50.247
They're coming out.

25:58.991 --> 26:00.891
Okay, I'm in position.

26:05.998 --> 26:07.231
Stay back!

26:07.233 --> 26:08.332
This is just
procedure, Frank.

26:26.018 --> 26:27.017
It's right there.

26:27.019 --> 26:28.586
Get in, get in,
go.

26:37.029 --> 26:38.128
Frank, I am unarmed.

26:38.130 --> 26:40.130
What are you doing here?

26:40.132 --> 26:42.132
My name's Ed Lane.

26:42.134 --> 26:44.201
I just want to talk.

26:52.678 --> 26:54.778
I don't like Ed
being in there unarmed.

26:54.780 --> 26:56.847
I can't see him. My view's
limited against the wall.

26:56.849 --> 26:59.183
PARKER: Spike, we have to
get Jules in position.

26:59.185 --> 27:01.085
Jules, I can
get you an angle,

27:01.087 --> 27:02.953
give you more
access to the room.
Show me.

27:02.955 --> 27:05.155
Here's Sam in the air vent.

27:05.157 --> 27:07.791
You'll get a view to
histology through this window.

27:07.793 --> 27:08.859
Got it?

27:08.861 --> 27:09.793
Got it.

27:09.795 --> 27:11.362
All right.

27:11.364 --> 27:12.630
Sam, Jules is on her way.

27:12.632 --> 27:13.631
Copy that.

27:13.633 --> 27:15.065
Seconds away.

27:15.067 --> 27:17.034
Okay, calm down.
Just calm down.

27:17.036 --> 27:19.136
I want you out
of here now!

27:19.138 --> 27:20.871
Frank, take it easy.

27:20.873 --> 27:23.073
Get out, now!
This is not what we discussed!

27:23.075 --> 27:24.642
ED: All right,
just try to calm down.

27:24.644 --> 27:26.810
I can see him, Sam.
We're covered.

27:26.812 --> 27:29.980
Frank, I'm a father
just like you are.

27:29.982 --> 27:32.816
Okay? Just like you are.

27:32.818 --> 27:35.653
Now, believe me, if I were you,
I would want answers, too.

27:35.655 --> 27:37.354
Now, Doc, where
are those samples?

27:37.356 --> 27:39.156
Uh, uh, the freezer.

27:39.158 --> 27:40.858
Let's test them, please.

27:54.407 --> 27:56.106
SPIKE: Ed, camera's
in a good position.

27:56.108 --> 27:59.810
ED: That's it, that's it.
Thanks, Doc.

27:59.812 --> 28:01.912
Eddie, make sure he sees
the slides are Taylor's.

28:01.914 --> 28:04.181
I don't want him thinking
we're pulling a fast one.

28:04.183 --> 28:05.416
SAM:
This is a problem.

28:05.418 --> 28:07.317
I'm 20% blind here.

28:07.319 --> 28:08.919
I got him, Sam.

28:08.921 --> 28:10.888
All right, let's
hold on one second.

28:10.890 --> 28:13.757
Let's make sure that
those are the right samples.

28:13.759 --> 28:14.892
Okay, Frank?

28:19.765 --> 28:21.398
FENTON:
Taylor McCormick.

28:24.236 --> 28:25.769
(sighs)

28:25.771 --> 28:28.839
That's my little girl.

28:30.242 --> 28:31.842
It's all that's
left of her.

28:31.844 --> 28:34.845
ED: Frank, they're
doing what you want, here.

28:34.847 --> 28:37.715
Do you think you could go
ahead and put that gun down?

28:37.717 --> 28:39.316
Not until these
tests are done!

28:39.318 --> 28:40.951
ED:
Okay.

28:40.953 --> 28:45.355
Well, let's let
them do their thing.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.660
Doc, go ahead.

28:49.661 --> 28:51.361
(indistinct conversation
over speakers)

28:59.472 --> 29:02.306
This doctor's not used to
needing second opinions.

29:02.308 --> 29:05.142
She's the gold standard
in forensic pathology.

29:05.144 --> 29:07.111
Frank's theory that
she might be wrong...

29:07.113 --> 29:09.079
PARKER:
Wishful thinking, I know.

29:09.081 --> 29:11.315
Eddie, find common ground.

29:11.317 --> 29:14.051
I'm worried what happens
when they finish those tests.

29:18.991 --> 29:22.392
I bet she was
a good mom.

29:23.429 --> 29:24.895
FRANK:
Yeah.

29:26.098 --> 29:30.934
She was beautiful.

29:30.936 --> 29:32.369
Patient.

29:35.941 --> 29:39.109
(sighs)
She fed her,and she...

29:39.111 --> 29:42.346
changed her.

29:42.348 --> 29:44.414
Got up in the middle
of the night.

29:46.318 --> 29:48.185
She always cried
when you gave her to me.

29:48.187 --> 29:51.822
You were away.

29:51.824 --> 29:53.924
She didn't know your smell.

29:53.926 --> 29:56.527
So she wanted me.

29:56.529 --> 29:58.095
ED: Those first
few months,

29:58.097 --> 30:00.130
it's all about Mom.

30:02.134 --> 30:03.367
KERRY:
You got it, though.

30:03.369 --> 30:05.369
In your own way.

30:05.371 --> 30:08.338
You... He sang to her.

30:10.442 --> 30:11.809
She liked classic rock.

30:11.811 --> 30:15.312
Stones. Eagles.

30:16.148 --> 30:19.817
Good taste.

30:19.818 --> 30:23.487
I always thought I'd take
her to her first concert...

30:23.489 --> 30:25.556
(sighs heavily)

30:25.558 --> 30:27.457
...teach her
how to play guitar.

30:31.330 --> 30:34.131
I didn't even get
to go to her funeral.

30:41.106 --> 30:46.009
You know, Frank, whatever
those test results say...

30:46.011 --> 30:47.978
they're not gonna
bring Taylor back.

30:55.454 --> 30:57.054
Wanna have a look?

30:59.491 --> 31:01.892
Okay.

31:02.027 --> 31:04.194
(sighs)

31:04.563 --> 31:06.997
Okay.

31:11.270 --> 31:13.570
This is an image of
Taylor's brain cells.

31:13.572 --> 31:16.573
There's evidence of
edema, hemorrage.

31:16.575 --> 31:19.877
Consistent with injury sustained
during a violent trauma.

31:19.879 --> 31:21.879
There was no violent trauma!

31:21.881 --> 31:24.414
We could re-test
the samples a thousand times.

31:24.416 --> 31:27.050
The results won't change.

31:27.052 --> 31:30.120
Science doesn't lie.

31:30.122 --> 31:32.222
But, but I do, that's
what you're saying!

31:32.224 --> 31:34.224
All right, look, is there
anything else, anything at all,

31:34.226 --> 31:35.225
that would've caused
these symptoms?

31:35.227 --> 31:36.994
Yes.

31:36.996 --> 31:38.962
Uh, uh, a vitamin C
deficiency, Barlow's disease,

31:38.964 --> 31:40.197
but those all
came back negative.

31:40.199 --> 31:42.900
Run the tests again.

31:42.902 --> 31:44.485
FENTON:
There's no need.

31:44.486 --> 31:46.069
FRANK: Nobody's leaving
until you test it again!

31:46.071 --> 31:47.304
Get back!
Frank!

31:47.306 --> 31:48.639
Frank, put the
gun down now.

31:48.641 --> 31:49.640
Put it down.

31:49.642 --> 31:51.408
I did not kill my child.

31:51.410 --> 31:52.943
Let's slow
it down here.

31:52.945 --> 31:54.177
I was there!

31:54.179 --> 31:55.145
Sam, Jules.

31:56.115 --> 31:57.281
He's out of range.

31:57.283 --> 31:59.549
I'm out of range,
adjusting position.

31:59.551 --> 32:01.351
(vent bangs open)
Oh...!

32:01.353 --> 32:02.386
(clunking)

32:02.388 --> 32:03.453
(distant thud)

32:03.455 --> 32:06.089
FRANK:
What was that?

32:06.091 --> 32:08.158
(switch clicks, alarm blares)

32:08.160 --> 32:09.459
No solution, I got no view.

32:09.461 --> 32:12.029
What just happened?
He hit lockdown.

32:12.031 --> 32:14.181
It activates
the ventilation system.

32:14.182 --> 32:16.332
(wind rushing)
SPIKE: Sam, get out
of there now.

32:20.306 --> 32:21.956
Frank, take it easy.
You had a guy
up there

32:21.957 --> 32:23.607
this whole time,
pointing a gun at me?

32:23.609 --> 32:25.542
JULES: Ed's not covered,
guys, come on.

32:28.414 --> 32:30.047
(grunting with effort)

32:30.049 --> 32:31.214
Sam, status.

32:31.216 --> 32:32.649
He's still on the line!

32:34.653 --> 32:36.520
FRANK: You're trying
to get me killed!
I'm okay.

32:36.522 --> 32:38.055
But I don't have a view.

32:38.057 --> 32:39.389
Spike, can you try to
override the ventilation system?

32:39.391 --> 32:41.525
SPIKE: "There is do or do not,
there is no try."

32:41.527 --> 32:42.559
Can you kill the alarm?

32:42.561 --> 32:44.061
Yes, yes, sir. One sec.

32:44.063 --> 32:45.662
What are they
doing up there?
Take it easy.

32:45.664 --> 32:47.097
You said you were
just gonna talk!

32:47.099 --> 32:48.632
Frank, he's here
to keep me safe,

32:48.634 --> 32:50.033
he is not here
to hurt you.

32:50.035 --> 32:51.501
You had a guy in
the ceiling this whole time?

32:51.503 --> 32:52.602
Frank, just stop.

32:52.604 --> 32:54.538
Stop fighting!
Listen to your wife.

32:54.540 --> 32:56.506
Don't you talk to me.
Keep testing.

32:56.508 --> 32:58.675
FENTON:
The facts don't lie.

32:58.677 --> 33:00.344
FRANK: I know what
happened that night!

33:00.346 --> 33:02.312
I could never have hurt Taylor!

33:02.314 --> 33:04.348
You loved her so much

33:04.350 --> 33:06.516
you couldn't live with
the memory of what you did.

33:06.518 --> 33:08.485
No. No, no, I couldn't.

33:08.487 --> 33:10.187
I couldn't.

33:10.189 --> 33:11.655
PARKER:
Eddie, this is delicate here.

33:11.657 --> 33:13.390
He needs to know he's not alone.

33:13.392 --> 33:15.392
Spike.
I know,boss, I know.

33:17.997 --> 33:24.501
Kerry... Frank said
that when he met you,

33:24.503 --> 33:26.103
that you could see
right into him.

33:26.105 --> 33:28.572
That you knew him.

33:28.574 --> 33:30.640
Can you tell him
what you think

33:30.642 --> 33:33.710
may have happened that night?

33:33.712 --> 33:38.081
You were exhausted.

33:38.083 --> 33:40.250
You got home,
you just needed to...

33:40.252 --> 33:42.719
lie down
and close your eyes; rest.

33:44.690 --> 33:47.257
But she was crying, and crying,
and your nerves were raw,

33:47.259 --> 33:49.559
you had a drink.

33:49.561 --> 33:51.695
You tried everything
to make her stop crying,

33:51.697 --> 33:55.565
so you bounced her, 'cause
that worked most of the time,

33:55.567 --> 33:58.618
and she loved that,

33:58.619 --> 34:01.670
and maybe you bounced her
harder than you realized.

34:01.673 --> 34:03.173
No...

34:03.175 --> 34:05.675
No, it was the,
the normal bounce,

34:05.677 --> 34:07.577
the way I always did it.

34:07.579 --> 34:09.646
(Eddie's PDA buzzes)

34:12.451 --> 34:15.319
KERRY: Dr. Fenton,
is it possible that

34:15.320 --> 34:18.188
that could have caused those,
those injuries that you saw.

34:18.190 --> 34:20.624
Yes, it's...
it's possible.

34:20.626 --> 34:22.292
Then if that's
what it was,

34:22.294 --> 34:26.430
then maybe it was
just an accident.

34:26.432 --> 34:28.598
And the accident's... just...

34:28.600 --> 34:31.301
It happened.

34:31.303 --> 34:34.771
And now... and now it's...

34:34.773 --> 34:36.139
now it's over.

34:36.141 --> 34:37.707
(sobbing):
Oh, God.

34:37.709 --> 34:41.144
KERRY:
It's finished.
No, no, no, no...

34:44.349 --> 34:45.682
ED:
Frank...

34:45.684 --> 34:47.284
Frank, maybe it's time

34:47.286 --> 34:48.752
to get some closure on this.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.387
You, you and Kerry both.

34:50.389 --> 34:52.722
Maybe it's time to...

34:52.724 --> 34:54.791
try to say goodbye
to Taylor.

34:54.793 --> 34:56.226
Frank?
I'm sorry.

34:56.228 --> 34:58.595
ED:
Frank, listen to me.

34:58.597 --> 35:01.131
Frank? Spike, where's
that override?

35:01.133 --> 35:03.700
I know, I know!
(typing furiously)

35:03.702 --> 35:05.102
Frank, give me the gun. Frank!

35:05.104 --> 35:06.203
Look away!

35:06.205 --> 35:08.405
I've got a distraction.

35:08.407 --> 35:10.574
Don't do this.
Don't do it to your wife.
KERRY: Frank!

35:10.576 --> 35:11.641
Spike...

35:11.643 --> 35:13.844
I'm in.
Overriding lockdown now.

35:13.846 --> 35:14.845
FRANK:
Look away.

35:14.846 --> 35:15.845
(fan blades whine as they slow)

35:15.848 --> 35:17.547
ED: Put the gun down!
KERRY: No!

35:17.549 --> 35:19.816
Sam, now!

35:42.474 --> 35:44.541
Subject in custody.

35:44.543 --> 35:45.809
I gotcha, buddy.

35:45.811 --> 35:46.743
(sobbing):
I can't go on.

35:46.745 --> 35:49.846
I gotcha.
Just let me...

35:49.848 --> 35:51.381
I gotcha.

35:51.383 --> 35:52.482
I can't go on.

35:52.484 --> 35:53.884
It's okay,
you're gonna be okay.

35:54.853 --> 35:57.220
(gasping)

35:57.222 --> 35:58.388
Just take one breath,

35:58.390 --> 36:00.690
then you take another one.
That's it.

36:00.692 --> 36:02.859
You're gonna be okay.

36:09.768 --> 36:14.371
(gently):
It's okay... Okay...

36:34.726 --> 36:36.426
I gotta go.
What's up?

36:36.428 --> 36:37.928
Sophie.

36:37.930 --> 36:40.197
Go.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.860
Are you okay?

37:10.862 --> 37:12.812
You okay?
How you doing?

37:12.813 --> 37:14.763
There was so much blood.
I was scared.

37:14.766 --> 37:16.499
You did good.

37:16.501 --> 37:19.736
You were the man
of the house today.

37:19.738 --> 37:21.404
I'm so proud of you.

37:25.911 --> 37:30.847
"3:31 p.m. Officer Lane: 'Maybe
it's time to find some closure.

37:30.849 --> 37:32.782
You and Kerry together.'"

37:32.784 --> 37:34.818
(PDA buzzes)

37:34.820 --> 37:36.753
Carry on, Jules.
(quietly): Hello?

37:36.755 --> 37:38.588
What would you
rather live with,

37:38.590 --> 37:40.390
believing you're innocent,
or knowing you're guilty?

37:40.392 --> 37:41.891
Nah, you don't forget
you killed your kid.

37:41.893 --> 37:43.994
Oh, I think he did.
I think that he blocked it out.

37:43.996 --> 37:46.663
He was as good as convicted;
he had a ticket to freedom,

37:46.665 --> 37:48.898
but instead of running, he
turned around and went home.

37:48.900 --> 37:50.800
'Cause it wouldn't
have been freedom,

37:50.802 --> 37:52.869
leaving behind a wife
who thinks you're a killer.

37:54.940 --> 37:57.974
Dr. Valo
on the phone.

37:57.976 --> 38:00.010
REPORTER: Although the baby had
all the classic symptoms

38:00.012 --> 38:01.461
of shaken baby syndrome,

38:01.462 --> 38:02.911
the coroner neglected to
administer a test called

38:02.914 --> 38:06.783
a "Gram stain," which would have
led to a different diagnosis:

38:06.785 --> 38:08.818
bacterial meningitis.

38:08.820 --> 38:10.987
The baby had a cold that
caused an ear infection.

38:10.989 --> 38:14.691
Dr. Fenton overlooked it,
but Dr. Valo didn't.

38:14.693 --> 38:17.360
Taylor wasn't shaken.

38:17.362 --> 38:20.297
REPORTER: Dr. Fenton, why didn't
you run the extra test?

38:20.299 --> 38:22.299
There was no need.
The evidence was conclusive.

38:22.301 --> 38:23.667
REPORTER: How do you feel
about the suggestion

38:23.669 --> 38:25.669
that your other cases
may be reopened?

38:25.671 --> 38:27.337
The sample was contaminated.

38:27.339 --> 38:28.571
There's no other explanation.

38:31.677 --> 38:34.444
So Frank was innocent all along.

38:34.446 --> 38:39.015
Tell me we haven't had days when
we want to cut to the chase.

38:39.017 --> 38:41.851
Frank and Kerry get
a second chance today.

38:46.992 --> 38:50.393
¶ What is this road? ¶

38:50.395 --> 38:53.863
¶ What is this journey? ¶

38:53.865 --> 39:02.472
¶ And where does time go
so slowly? ¶

39:02.474 --> 39:08.378
¶ Love may be the end of us ¶

39:08.380 --> 39:15.752
¶ But why, why should we fear? ¶

39:15.754 --> 39:22.759

all the wondering ¶

39:22.761 --> 39:25.929
¶ I'm weightless here...¶

39:25.931 --> 39:28.498
Hey.

39:29.434 --> 39:31.901
Hey. Hey.

39:31.903 --> 39:34.037
You didn't
answer your phone.

39:34.039 --> 39:36.906
I'm sorry.

39:36.908 --> 39:38.808
Soph, I am so sorry.

39:38.810 --> 39:40.910
You okay?

39:40.912 --> 39:44.781
¶ What is this someday? ¶

39:44.783 --> 39:47.517
Doctor said there's something
wrong with the placenta.

39:47.519 --> 39:50.153
It's partially separated.

39:50.155 --> 39:52.856
They put me on bed rest.

39:52.858 --> 39:55.925
I know, I know. He told me.

39:55.927 --> 39:59.863
He said the baby's
gonna be fine, though.

39:59.865 --> 40:01.965
Yeah, she'll be okay.

40:01.967 --> 40:05.668
A she?

40:05.670 --> 40:06.836
Did you know that?

40:06.838 --> 40:08.671
Yeah.

40:11.943 --> 40:13.810
You guys don't
tell me anything.

40:13.812 --> 40:16.946
¶ Love may be the end of us ¶

40:16.948 --> 40:22.986
¶ But why, why should we fear? ¶

40:22.988 --> 40:24.120
Okay.

40:24.122 --> 40:30.994
¶ Because with
all the wondering ¶

40:30.996 --> 40:34.164
¶ I'm weightless
in my dreams. ¶
