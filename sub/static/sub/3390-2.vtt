WEBVTT

01:02.533 --> 01:05.433
Secure the interrogation room
and release the tranquilizing gas.

01:05.800 --> 01:06.633
Leave him.

01:13.033 --> 01:14.467
He's mentally unstable.

01:15.133 --> 01:16.100
He could be dangerous.

02:09.367 --> 02:10.633
Give me his test results.

02:21.533 --> 02:22.400
Sa-woo!

02:23.133 --> 02:24.100
Sa-woo!

02:33.000 --> 02:33.900
Sa-woo!

02:36.500 --> 02:37.433
Sa-woo!

02:48.500 --> 02:49.333
Sa-woo!

02:50.400 --> 02:51.400
Sa-woo!

02:56.600 --> 03:00.166
Sa-woo, Sa-woo. Wake up, Sa-woo.

03:00.333 --> 03:01.166
Sa-woo.

03:02.266 --> 03:03.500
Sa-woo, wake up boy!

04:06.367 --> 04:07.433
That's not going to work.

04:38.400 --> 04:39.900
Welcome to the NSS.

04:41.033 --> 04:42.000
Where am I?

04:43.800 --> 04:45.700
I just told you, we're the NSS.

04:46.367 --> 04:48.533
We are known as
the National Security Service.

04:49.266 --> 04:50.200
Well...

04:50.767 --> 04:52.000
The peace of the nation?

04:53.100 --> 04:56.567
Let's just say this is where people defeat
the enemies that threaten the nation.

04:57.800 --> 05:00.266
It's not that different from
the task force that you were in.

05:01.934 --> 05:02.800
Except,

05:03.500 --> 05:06.934
the existence of the NSS
isn't disclosed to the public.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.333
Why are you doing this to us?

05:12.033 --> 05:14.934
I'm sure you've gone through a lot
in the last few hours.

05:16.133 --> 05:20.400
Let's say it's a rite of passage
to become an NSS member.

05:22.467 --> 05:24.700
Although the nation has chosen you,

05:25.367 --> 05:27.567
you have the right to decline.

05:29.066 --> 05:30.433
If you want to give up,

05:31.000 --> 05:32.100
you may leave now.

05:37.633 --> 05:42.166
The NSS has been testing
your competence for a long time.

05:42.934 --> 05:46.533
We came to the conclusion
that you two are qualified to be agents,

05:47.600 --> 05:50.300
and you have just passed the final test.

05:51.934 --> 05:53.633
If you decide to be our agents,

05:54.233 --> 05:56.600
you'll go through
special training programs

05:56.667 --> 05:59.333
for the next six months
before being sent out on the field.

06:00.066 --> 06:02.200
I hope you'll make a prudent decision.

07:02.266 --> 07:05.600
NATIONAL SECURITY SERVICE

07:34.867 --> 07:35.700
Hey,

07:36.400 --> 07:37.400
relax.

07:38.533 --> 07:39.700
We're in the center of Seoul.

08:24.166 --> 08:25.500
Just relax.

08:56.333 --> 09:00.433
I'm Sang-hyun Park, secretary
of the NSS counter terrorism division.

09:02.467 --> 09:03.333
First of all,

09:03.734 --> 09:05.900
I'd like to congratulate you
on becoming NSS agents.

09:08.367 --> 09:09.266
Introduce yourselves.

09:10.367 --> 09:11.233
I'm Tae-sung Hwang.

09:11.300 --> 09:12.567
I'm Mi-jeong Yang.

09:15.266 --> 09:16.200
Mi-jeong Yang is

09:16.633 --> 09:18.300
the best hacker in Korea.

09:18.934 --> 09:21.100
She'll help you
with computer related tasks.

09:21.500 --> 09:22.500
Tae-sung Hwang

09:22.667 --> 09:25.567
will support you in every other aspect
when you're carrying out your missions.

09:27.066 --> 09:28.100
You two may leave now.

09:33.533 --> 09:34.533
This is

09:34.800 --> 09:36.000
Seung-hee Choi, your team leader.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.200
She's also our expert profiler.

09:41.500 --> 09:44.900
You'll need her help a lot
to quickly adapt to the NSS.

09:46.133 --> 09:48.133
You'll also be learning
profiling techniques

09:48.500 --> 09:50.467
which is necessary on your assignments.

09:51.166 --> 09:52.266
I'll leave first.

09:52.800 --> 09:53.867
You three talk here.

09:54.700 --> 09:58.100
Right, you know we're visiting
the Deputy Director's house today, right?

09:58.367 --> 09:59.467
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

10:04.533 --> 10:05.533
I'll be right back.

10:26.233 --> 10:27.100
Sir,

10:28.100 --> 10:29.467
may I talk to you for a second?

10:37.166 --> 10:38.667
Did you plan this from the beginning?

10:40.133 --> 10:41.967
Did you approached me
with all these intentions?

10:44.500 --> 10:45.367
Sa-woo.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.200
Everyone can see

10:48.200 --> 10:49.533
what you're doing to me right now.

10:51.200 --> 10:54.233
There's no dead zone in the NSS
that cameras don't cover.

11:08.633 --> 11:09.467
You're right.

11:10.667 --> 11:12.533
I contacted you
because I wanted to recruit you.

11:13.500 --> 11:14.333
But,

11:14.600 --> 11:16.467
now you understand

11:17.166 --> 11:18.834
why I had to conceal my identity, right?

11:18.900 --> 11:20.667
You still shouldn't have done this to me.

11:21.400 --> 11:23.433
Although I was well trained in the force,
I almost died!

11:23.500 --> 11:24.500
Hey,

11:25.200 --> 11:27.467
I've been through the same thing. Okay?

11:28.367 --> 11:29.266
You did well.

11:30.867 --> 11:32.900
Let's have a drink together, okay?

11:49.433 --> 11:51.133
Did you show up in the classroom

11:52.533 --> 11:54.333
on purpose in the first place?

11:55.467 --> 11:56.333
That's right.

11:58.066 --> 12:00.367
That was a necessary process

12:01.066 --> 12:02.333
for me to profile you.

12:03.767 --> 12:06.200
Why don't you become an actress?
I'll be your manager.

12:06.467 --> 12:07.834
I'm sure we'll make a lot of money.

12:11.633 --> 12:14.533
I do become an actress
when it's required to complete a mission.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.133
How was my acting skills?

12:17.834 --> 12:19.367
Are you joking with me now?

12:40.667 --> 12:43.166
I believe that you're aware
of the rules you need to comply with

12:43.233 --> 12:45.233
as NSS agents as you went through
the orientation.

12:45.300 --> 12:47.767
You never know when you'll be
sent to carry out missions.

12:47.834 --> 12:50.767
So you must always be on standby.

12:51.900 --> 12:54.166
And there won't be
individual profiling training sessions

12:54.567 --> 12:56.166
as Secretary Park has mentioned.

12:56.900 --> 12:58.600
I'll tell you what to do
while you're on duty

12:58.700 --> 12:59.867
when it's needed.

13:02.066 --> 13:03.066
Any questions?

13:09.867 --> 13:11.600
Let's go to meet with
the Deputy Director then.

13:23.433 --> 13:24.633
It was a harsh test, wasn't it?

13:27.834 --> 13:31.266
Both Secretary Park and I
couldn't disclose our identities.

13:32.000 --> 13:32.967
I'm sorry.

13:34.900 --> 13:35.867
It's okay.

13:36.700 --> 13:37.734
I understand now.

13:46.800 --> 13:47.633
Let's go.

13:47.700 --> 13:48.567
Okay.

13:55.166 --> 13:56.066
What did she say?

13:56.734 --> 13:57.667
Well...

13:57.834 --> 13:58.834
Nothing special.

14:24.233 --> 14:25.133
Sir!

14:25.867 --> 14:27.066
-How are you, sir?
-You're here.

14:27.233 --> 14:28.200
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

14:28.266 --> 14:29.300
Nice to have you here.

14:31.300 --> 14:32.633
You've been through a lot.

14:33.467 --> 14:35.567
I just wanted to have dinner with you.

14:38.767 --> 14:40.266
We're honored

14:40.333 --> 14:43.100
to be served with your dishes
and tea today.

14:43.367 --> 14:45.300
I'm afraid that we're giving you
extra work all day.

14:45.367 --> 14:48.967
Please, don't mention it.
I hope you liked it.

14:49.734 --> 14:51.600
We really enjoyed it, ma'am.

14:51.667 --> 14:52.667
-You did?
-Yes.

14:52.734 --> 14:56.400
I don't know about anything else,
but my wife is a great cook.

14:56.467 --> 14:57.967
It was really tasty.

14:58.033 --> 14:59.467
Please teach me how to cook next time.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.333
They're rookies. How do they look?

15:02.500 --> 15:03.700
They look competent, don't they?

15:04.033 --> 15:06.266
I don't really know about your jobs,

15:06.734 --> 15:08.800
but you two are very handsome.

15:09.633 --> 15:11.066
Seung-hee is beautiful as well.

15:12.767 --> 15:15.333
I guess your company prefers
only good looking people.

15:15.633 --> 15:20.834
I've only invited handsome people,
but not everyone is like them.

15:25.300 --> 15:28.367
When will we be assigned
with our first mission?

15:28.934 --> 15:29.900
Why?

15:30.066 --> 15:31.133
Are you raring to go?

15:31.200 --> 15:32.600
Really?

15:33.700 --> 15:34.667
Be patient.

15:34.734 --> 15:35.867
Things will come up soon.

15:38.767 --> 15:40.233
I'll be right back.

15:44.633 --> 15:45.633
Hello?

15:48.300 --> 15:49.266
The Deputy Director's wife

15:49.834 --> 15:53.066
doesn't seem to know at all
what his job really is.

15:53.433 --> 15:56.000
That's why he's scary. Okay?

15:56.934 --> 15:58.633
Although it hasn't been long for me,

15:59.433 --> 16:03.033
it's been really hard
to keep my job a secret from my wife.

16:03.767 --> 16:06.233
But the Deputy Director has kept it
a secret for more than 30 years.

16:06.300 --> 16:08.000
No ordinary person can do that.

16:08.934 --> 16:10.600
He's indeed very unyielding.

16:11.934 --> 16:13.533
Although he is
the deputy director in title,

16:13.767 --> 16:15.934
he's practically the head of the NSS.

16:16.633 --> 16:18.900
A new person takes over
the title of a director

16:19.233 --> 16:20.633
every time a new president is elected.

16:25.533 --> 16:26.433
Let's have a toast.

16:28.667 --> 16:31.934
The final decision can be changed
according to Secretary Oh's analysis.

16:33.300 --> 16:34.734
Let's discuss the details tomorrow.

16:35.533 --> 16:36.500
Okay.

16:45.367 --> 16:46.600
Why are you here?

16:49.433 --> 16:51.033
You said you observed and profiled me.

16:52.100 --> 16:54.767
Then you must have
found out something. What is it?

16:55.433 --> 16:56.467
I can't tell you.

16:59.133 --> 17:01.700
You ought to apologize for mocking me.

17:02.133 --> 17:03.600
You're such an ill-mannered grump.

17:03.667 --> 17:05.400
Watch your language. I'm your superior.

17:07.333 --> 17:08.800
I've done nothing to apologize for.

17:11.166 --> 17:13.500
If you really have to know,
I'll tell you.

17:14.533 --> 17:19.033
You're being so condescending
and trying to act macho,

17:19.100 --> 17:22.100
but that's only to cover up
old wounds or painful memories.

17:22.467 --> 17:24.300
And you're egocentric all the time.

17:24.800 --> 17:27.300
That's also caused
by underlying self-defense mechanism.

17:28.300 --> 17:29.300
And...

17:31.166 --> 17:33.066
You've fallen for me at first sight.

17:33.633 --> 17:34.667
But that's too bad.

17:35.266 --> 17:37.467
The NSS strictly prohibits
relationships between agents,

17:37.800 --> 17:39.367
and even if it's allowed,

17:41.033 --> 17:42.834
you're not my type.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.533
I don't know what your painful past is,

17:47.667 --> 17:49.467
but I absolutely abhor people

17:50.667 --> 17:51.800
who act macho.

17:53.500 --> 17:54.967
And let me get this straight again.

17:56.133 --> 17:58.100
I am your superior.

17:58.667 --> 17:59.667
If you ever dare to...

19:18.500 --> 19:19.533
Hyun-jun Kim.

19:20.633 --> 19:21.967
Please follow me.

19:26.300 --> 19:27.400
I'll be right back.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.467
There's no need to worry about that.

19:45.667 --> 19:48.867
This is the only place in the NSS
where there are no cameras.

19:51.300 --> 19:52.834
I see.

19:53.467 --> 19:54.500
Is there...

19:55.033 --> 19:57.133
anything you want to
secretly talk to me about?

19:58.200 --> 19:59.200
Hyun-jun Kim.

20:00.533 --> 20:01.533
Do I look easy to you?

20:03.633 --> 20:06.333
If not, do you think the NSS is a joke?

20:08.233 --> 20:10.000
Keep in mind that I'm your superior,

20:10.600 --> 20:14.300
and the NSS never allows
romantic relationships to develop

20:15.600 --> 20:16.533
between agents.

20:21.867 --> 20:23.066
Hold on, ma'am.

20:32.300 --> 20:34.533
Do you know why I joined the NSS?

20:39.867 --> 20:40.867
To be honest,

20:41.233 --> 20:44.533
I don't care about
the loyalty the NSS asks for.

20:46.166 --> 20:48.333
It's no different from
when I was in the special task force.

20:50.533 --> 20:53.133
What motivated me
to carry out all the dangerous missions

20:53.500 --> 20:54.834
with my life at risk

20:56.200 --> 20:58.133
wasn't patriotism
or anything like that at all.

20:59.066 --> 21:00.100
I just felt

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
that I found something interesting
for the first time.

21:04.533 --> 21:06.734
After I managed to get in the force,

21:08.633 --> 21:09.600
I realized

21:10.400 --> 21:12.767
that I was destined to be a soldier.

21:16.033 --> 21:18.166
And I've decided to join the NSS

21:19.834 --> 21:21.967
because this dangerous
and complicated organization

21:22.367 --> 21:24.100
seemed very simple to me.

21:25.333 --> 21:26.400
If I just risk my life,

21:26.834 --> 21:29.934
I thought I could keep the job
that I find interesting

21:30.000 --> 21:32.367
and that I think I'm meant for.

21:35.133 --> 21:36.033
I...

21:36.367 --> 21:38.800
don't have such loyalty

21:39.166 --> 21:40.333
or patriotism

21:40.834 --> 21:41.867
as an agent.

21:42.867 --> 21:45.967
But once I make up my mind,
I never give up.

21:48.433 --> 21:50.800
I've never thought
that you're an easy person

21:51.734 --> 21:53.767
ever since we first met in the classroom.

21:54.633 --> 21:58.800
And I'm serious about this.

22:08.967 --> 22:10.400
Well then,

22:10.667 --> 22:11.867
I'll get back to work.

23:55.000 --> 23:55.867
Ma'am,

23:57.633 --> 23:58.734
what are you staring at?

23:59.300 --> 24:00.533
It's nothing.

24:46.934 --> 24:48.433
UNDERWATER SOUND AMBIENT MODELLING

25:31.867 --> 25:32.934
Are you not leaving?

25:34.333 --> 25:35.367
You're not done yet?

25:35.900 --> 25:37.367
I should finish this.

26:14.867 --> 26:16.433
As our job is very sensitive,

26:16.500 --> 26:19.367
we perform autopsies that the
National Forensic Service can't handle.

26:22.100 --> 26:23.767
It's too noisy to fall asleep!

26:25.700 --> 26:27.633
He is Secretary Oh
of the Forensic Science Division.

26:28.834 --> 26:29.767
What is this?

26:30.500 --> 26:31.667
What?

26:32.233 --> 26:33.133
I see.

26:33.200 --> 26:34.500
Are they the new guys?

26:34.967 --> 26:35.800
Yes.

26:35.867 --> 26:36.867
I'm Hyun-jun Kim.

26:37.166 --> 26:38.667
I'm Sa-woo Jin.

26:39.066 --> 26:40.166
Okay.

27:00.767 --> 27:02.300
"Whoever fights monsters should see to it

27:03.033 --> 27:04.467
that in the process

27:04.533 --> 27:07.934
he does not become a monster."

27:09.300 --> 27:11.066
This is what Nietzsche said.

27:12.033 --> 27:13.033
Keep this in mind.

27:18.934 --> 27:20.133
You can leave now.

27:20.233 --> 27:22.367
I need some more sleep.

27:32.633 --> 27:34.367
Everyone here has some issues.

27:35.500 --> 27:37.967
Now the NSS has one more psycho.

27:38.033 --> 27:40.000
I'm sure things will go smoothly here.

27:43.266 --> 27:44.300
What did you mean by that?

27:45.100 --> 27:45.934
What?

27:46.700 --> 27:47.767
The Nietzsche's quote.

27:49.100 --> 27:50.500
I've read the profile

27:50.967 --> 27:52.500
of Hyun-jun Kim,

27:53.867 --> 27:56.200
and he's highly likely to be a monster.

27:57.533 --> 27:59.467
No, he's far from that.

28:00.233 --> 28:02.266
Although he pretends to be tough,
he's very innocent.

28:04.433 --> 28:05.266
What?

28:06.533 --> 28:09.133
Did you already fall for him?

28:10.934 --> 28:12.200
No way.

28:13.567 --> 28:16.000
My goodness.

28:26.567 --> 28:27.667
Are you going out?

28:27.734 --> 28:28.834
Yes.

28:29.333 --> 28:30.300
Where?

28:31.300 --> 28:32.333
Well...

28:32.767 --> 28:33.800
You know.

28:33.867 --> 28:35.066
What are you doing today?

28:36.367 --> 28:40.300
I'll just idle away my time at home.

28:42.767 --> 28:45.133
If you have time on your hands,
why don't you tidy up the room

28:45.467 --> 28:47.834
and do the laundry.

28:48.867 --> 28:50.500
Why don't  you  do that?

29:21.633 --> 29:22.834
Do you need anything else?

29:23.166 --> 29:24.166
A bottle of wine is enough.

29:25.100 --> 29:26.266
Okay. See you soon.

30:17.633 --> 30:18.967
What brings you here?

30:21.033 --> 30:22.133
Oh, well...

30:22.934 --> 30:24.233
You know...

30:24.667 --> 30:27.200
I was thinking about applying
the general data mining techniques

30:27.333 --> 30:29.934
to behavioral analysis.

30:30.667 --> 30:32.367
But I wasn't so sure about it.

30:35.100 --> 30:36.433
Well...

30:37.600 --> 30:39.967
You said I could ask

30:41.100 --> 30:43.066
anytime if I have questions
about profiling.

30:58.900 --> 31:00.066
This is Sa-woo Jin.

31:02.533 --> 31:03.767
Okay.

31:06.600 --> 31:07.734
It's the NSS.

31:10.867 --> 31:12.133
This is Yamamoto Takashi.

31:12.633 --> 31:15.133
He's been classified as a possible
terrorist and is being investigated

31:15.767 --> 31:17.934
by not only the NSS,
but also the Japanese Cabinet.

31:18.400 --> 31:19.633
He'll arrive in Korea

31:20.166 --> 31:21.800
via Incheon airport at 11:35 a.m.

31:22.066 --> 31:23.767
Mi-jeong, brief us
on his personal information.

31:24.300 --> 31:26.033
He doesn't have
an accurate birth certificate.

31:26.233 --> 31:27.567
He's estimated to be 45 years old.

31:27.967 --> 31:30.200
He is Japanese with Syrian citizenship.

31:30.834 --> 31:32.700
When the Japanese Red Army
declared its disbandment,

31:32.767 --> 31:34.867
some remaining members formed
a new organization.

31:34.934 --> 31:37.734
Takashi is known to be the successor
of that organization.

31:38.166 --> 31:39.934
When was the last known terror attack?

31:42.266 --> 31:45.333
It's presumed that they destroyed
a US military facility in Okinawa,

31:45.400 --> 31:47.300
when the US opened the army
to the public in 1999.

31:47.867 --> 31:49.133
If he's that dangerous,

31:49.200 --> 31:51.934
can the government deny his entry to Korea
or arrest him at the airport?

31:52.367 --> 31:53.700
It's not that simple.

31:55.066 --> 31:56.767
We need to know why he's visiting Korea.

31:58.100 --> 32:00.567
If he came here
to launch a terrorist attack,

32:01.166 --> 32:03.200
that means his accomplices
whom we haven't identified

32:03.600 --> 32:05.133
are already in Korea.

32:06.533 --> 32:07.600
This will be

32:07.667 --> 32:09.133
the first official mission.

32:09.233 --> 32:10.633
for agents Hyun-jun Kim and Sa-woo Jin,

32:10.900 --> 32:13.166
Find out the purpose of his visit,
those in contact with him,

32:13.533 --> 32:15.467
and his expected destinations
during the visit.

32:16.533 --> 32:18.233
Mi-jeong and Tae-sung, back them up.

32:21.900 --> 32:22.800
ARRIVAL

32:22.867 --> 32:23.934
TOKYO, NARITA

32:30.133 --> 32:31.200
He's on the move.

32:46.734 --> 32:48.500
Sa-woo, what are you doing?

33:47.667 --> 33:48.533
Is the result ready?

33:48.600 --> 33:49.500
Ma'am.

33:51.166 --> 33:52.100
Ta-da.

33:52.633 --> 33:53.533
This is for you.

33:54.133 --> 33:54.967
What is it?

33:55.233 --> 33:56.567
It's a tracking device

33:57.033 --> 33:58.667
we requested in the past
from the R&D Team.

33:59.567 --> 34:00.800
This is a perfect device

34:01.066 --> 34:02.500
that's capable of wireless transmission.

34:20.500 --> 34:22.834
He's at the last baccarat table
across the main doorway.

34:36.100 --> 34:37.266
Where is he?

34:53.233 --> 34:55.433
Pair zero, banker natural eight.

34:55.500 --> 34:56.800
Banker wins.

35:01.900 --> 35:03.000
You're really good.

35:04.500 --> 35:05.667
Are you a professional gambler?

35:29.033 --> 35:30.100
Open.

35:31.300 --> 35:32.467
Pair five.

35:37.200 --> 35:38.233
Race.

35:38.300 --> 35:39.600
Wow.

35:41.867 --> 35:43.233
You're amazing.

35:43.300 --> 35:44.533
Yes, I am.

36:00.700 --> 36:04.000
Why don't you come to my room
and have a glass of champagne with me?

36:08.367 --> 36:09.500
Well then, let's go.

36:10.834 --> 36:12.467
Please keep these with my chips.

36:12.533 --> 36:14.433
Thank you very much.

36:28.834 --> 36:33.066
Gambling is never easy.

36:34.433 --> 36:35.567
What is she thinking?

36:38.633 --> 36:40.066
Is she planning to give herself to him?

36:40.133 --> 36:41.500
Please just be quiet.

36:46.500 --> 36:48.367
Let's have a kiss
to celebrate today's victory.

36:54.000 --> 36:54.867
Oh,

36:54.934 --> 36:57.066
why don't you take a shower first?

36:57.400 --> 36:59.567
Well then, let's do it together.

37:01.066 --> 37:03.233
No way. That's too embarrassing.

37:03.300 --> 37:04.433
You can go first.

37:05.600 --> 37:06.500
Okay. I understand.

38:27.333 --> 38:29.133
I installed a GPS device on his phone.

38:30.700 --> 38:33.166
I'll meet him tomorrow again,
and you two can support me.

38:34.400 --> 38:35.500
I was a bit surprised.

38:36.200 --> 38:37.700
You told me to become an actress.

38:41.100 --> 38:42.133
See you tomorrow.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.533
I'm about to meet the target. Standby.

39:14.667 --> 39:15.600
How do you like it?

39:16.867 --> 39:17.900
What about this one?

39:17.967 --> 39:19.633
-I'll go inside and try this.
-Okay.

39:27.400 --> 39:29.300
Really? Okay.

39:33.467 --> 39:34.700
He's on the phone right now.

39:35.033 --> 39:36.533
He might be talking about where to meet.

39:36.900 --> 39:38.133
Tap his phone.

39:38.367 --> 39:39.600
Really? Okay.

39:49.433 --> 39:50.734
Who the hell are you?

39:50.834 --> 39:52.066
What? What's wrong?

40:42.767 --> 40:43.867
Are you okay?

40:43.934 --> 40:45.133
Hurry!

40:49.567 --> 40:50.500
Go!

40:53.066 --> 40:54.000
Now!

41:02.567 --> 41:03.734
Emergency. Emergency.

41:03.800 --> 41:04.967
Please track his location.

41:05.033 --> 41:07.767
My current location is W345 and E234.

41:08.367 --> 41:09.600
He's running to the front gate.

41:09.800 --> 41:12.567
The position is revised
to grid 354, west 234.

41:13.900 --> 41:16.734
Collect the data of all the buildings
and roads within a five-kilometer radius.

41:19.166 --> 41:20.367
Two seconds until data upload.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.433
Target spotted. Target spotted.

41:23.400 --> 41:25.000
The target is running to a shopping mall.

41:26.633 --> 41:28.233
Display the building's image
on the screen.

41:29.533 --> 41:31.333
Alley on your right, 25 meters ahead.

41:36.100 --> 41:37.533
The gate on the left of the stairs.

41:38.834 --> 41:40.867
The target is moving to
the first door of the basement.

41:40.934 --> 41:42.533
The target is running
through the back door.

41:42.600 --> 41:43.800
He's moving northwards.

41:56.934 --> 41:57.867
Where is he?

41:58.333 --> 41:59.233
I lost him.

41:59.400 --> 42:01.233
I'll let you know
as soon as I find his location.

42:01.300 --> 42:03.467
Secure all available CCTV cameras
in Itaewon.

42:07.734 --> 42:08.934
Check TK1's current location.

42:09.633 --> 42:10.834
TK1, report your location.

42:11.834 --> 42:13.200
I'm 50 meters away from

42:13.767 --> 42:15.033
Itaewon station exit number four.

42:19.667 --> 42:20.867
Target found.

42:21.500 --> 42:22.633
TK1, to your seven o'clock.

42:22.700 --> 42:24.433
The target is at the gate
behind the building.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.400
He's moving towards the intersection.

42:27.934 --> 42:29.066
He's within 50 meters from you.

42:29.567 --> 42:30.600
Do not lose him this time.

42:39.867 --> 42:40.867
Target spotted.

42:40.934 --> 42:41.967
On a CCTV camera.

42:50.400 --> 42:51.900
The target is entering the restaurant.

43:16.266 --> 43:17.333
Check the traffic conditions

43:17.400 --> 43:18.900
and find out his possible escape routes.

43:23.266 --> 43:24.934
He is moving toward Hannam intersection.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.767
Through the industrial complex
on Gueui Street.

43:27.367 --> 43:28.633
Roadwork, 100 meters ahead.

43:28.700 --> 43:30.800
He's likely to change his direction
to the main street.

43:33.367 --> 43:35.233
The target is off the bike
and is moving eastward.

43:38.967 --> 43:40.433
To your 11. To your 11.

43:51.400 --> 43:52.900
The target has gone into
Seongsu station.

44:25.133 --> 44:26.633
Doors closing.

44:31.467 --> 44:32.667
Move, move aside!

44:33.667 --> 44:34.667
Move!

44:40.834 --> 44:41.867
What happened to him?

44:42.033 --> 44:43.467
Move, move away!

44:43.633 --> 44:47.567
-Is he dead?
-What's happening?

44:47.800 --> 44:50.967
-Is that blood?
-Is he dead or what?

45:46.333 --> 45:47.200
Huh?

45:48.266 --> 45:49.333
Well...

45:49.400 --> 45:50.900
The bullet traveled downwards

45:50.967 --> 45:54.533
between cervical vertebra one
and the occipital bone.

45:55.200 --> 45:56.400
When a spinning bullet

45:57.133 --> 45:58.500
enters a cranial bone,

45:58.867 --> 46:00.367
its rotation radius widens,

46:00.734 --> 46:04.500
damaging the occipital,
temporal and parietal lobes,

46:04.567 --> 46:06.400
thus destroying the entire frontal lobe.

46:06.934 --> 46:07.900
Do you want to see?

46:09.266 --> 46:10.734
No, thank you, sir.

46:14.266 --> 46:15.166
This...

46:15.934 --> 46:17.734
must have been done by a professional.

46:23.400 --> 46:24.934
It seems like Takashi

46:25.300 --> 46:27.467
was going to meet his contact
at Seongsu Station.

46:28.567 --> 46:29.633
But the contact

46:30.300 --> 46:32.333
saw that we were after Takashi.

46:33.066 --> 46:35.100
So he killed Takashi and disappeared.

46:35.567 --> 46:38.066
Considering that he had a contact here,

46:38.800 --> 46:41.333
it's obvious that he came to Korea
to launch a terror attack.

46:43.300 --> 46:45.066
Have you identified the target
Takashi was after?

46:45.533 --> 46:47.667
Not yet, sir.

46:47.934 --> 46:50.700
Put an end to it as soon as possible,
before things get worse.

46:51.166 --> 46:54.166
We've thoroughly reviewed the places
he had been in Korea, his belongings,

46:54.533 --> 46:56.266
and even all his records,

46:56.834 --> 46:59.166
but we have failed to identify
any target he planned to attack.

46:59.467 --> 47:01.200
Possible prime targets
we've came up with are,

47:01.767 --> 47:03.367
first, the President,

47:03.800 --> 47:05.700
second, the U.S. ambassador,

47:06.066 --> 47:09.400
and lastly, the Chief Cabinet Secretary
who is currently on a visit to Korea.

47:10.000 --> 47:11.834
We've informed the Office of
Presidential Security

47:11.900 --> 47:13.233
and the U.S. and Japan embassies

47:13.300 --> 47:14.633
about the possible danger.

47:16.166 --> 47:18.467
Although the existence
of a terrorist is confirmed,

47:18.867 --> 47:20.500
such speculations are too vague.

47:22.667 --> 47:23.500
Well...

47:24.400 --> 47:25.800
I think

47:26.233 --> 47:27.900
one of the presidential candidates

47:28.066 --> 47:29.734
might be the target.

47:30.166 --> 47:31.200
What makes you think that?

47:32.000 --> 47:34.033
Well...

47:35.133 --> 47:37.166
There's no evidence of that.

47:37.934 --> 47:40.133
But what I felt
when I was tailing Takashi--

47:40.200 --> 47:41.600
What are you talking about?

47:42.266 --> 47:43.433
Are you saying

47:43.800 --> 47:45.567
that we should devise plans
based on your hunch?

47:46.734 --> 47:48.767
We need to take every possibility
into account--

47:48.834 --> 47:51.266
It's already confusing enough.
Stop talking nonsense!

47:52.233 --> 47:53.233
You two,

47:53.567 --> 47:54.667
stay out of this mission

47:55.500 --> 47:56.567
and be on standby.

47:57.133 --> 48:00.066
Hunches of agents are often
more accurate than lab analysis.

48:01.400 --> 48:03.233
And I'm the one who decides

48:04.133 --> 48:05.767
whether to use the two agents or not.

48:06.800 --> 48:07.700
Seung-hee Choi,

48:08.066 --> 48:09.133
what's the matter with you?

48:10.600 --> 48:11.667
The three of you,

48:11.734 --> 48:12.867
be on standby for now.

48:33.867 --> 48:35.433
Are you really going to just sit here?

48:48.600 --> 48:50.934
What an easy way
to turn a person into a fool.

48:55.734 --> 48:56.567
Where are you going?

48:57.800 --> 49:00.767
Can you get me the election campaign
schedules of the presidential candidates?

49:01.066 --> 49:02.033
What for?

49:02.100 --> 49:03.133
Just find it for me.

49:03.200 --> 49:04.533
Yes, sir.

50:13.166 --> 50:16.066
Damn it, you just got reprimanded.

50:18.266 --> 50:20.233
Myung-ho Cho is having a speech here.

50:20.934 --> 50:22.767
He's the front runner
in the presidential election.

50:28.400 --> 50:29.667
Where would you be if you were him?

50:51.767 --> 50:53.800
-Myung-ho Cho!
-Myung-ho Cho!

50:55.633 --> 50:56.667
Right there.

50:56.734 --> 50:58.033

Go there.

51:02.266 --> 51:03.133
What about you?

51:03.200 --> 51:04.600
I'll protect the target.

51:04.667 --> 51:06.367
Hyun-jun, hold on.

51:12.834 --> 51:13.967
This is Sa-woo Jin.

51:14.667 --> 51:15.967
I have a favor to ask you.

51:17.100 --> 51:18.100
I can't.

51:18.567 --> 51:20.233
You were on a mission last time,

51:20.300 --> 51:21.734
but not this time.

51:22.433 --> 51:23.767
I'll get in serious trouble.

51:24.367 --> 51:26.033
I know. Please do it for me.

51:33.700 --> 51:34.633
Ma'am...

51:37.900 --> 51:38.967
What is it?

51:44.133 --> 51:45.900
Don't worry. I'll take
responsibility for it.

51:56.166 --> 51:57.333
Can you zoom in there?

52:09.767 --> 52:11.533
TK1, TK2, code EX.

52:11.867 --> 52:13.800
X2Y1 point on the rooftop
of Hyoryeong Building.

52:21.300 --> 52:22.767
Myung-ho Cho!

52:22.834 --> 52:24.834
-Myung-ho Cho!
-Myung-ho Cho!

52:39.333 --> 52:41.200
MYUNG-HO CHO

52:57.400 --> 52:59.467
This is TK2, sniper has been shot dead.

53:04.900 --> 53:06.233
HYORYEONG BUILDING

53:06.600 --> 53:07.700
They must have a backup plan.

53:08.367 --> 53:10.066
TK1, TK2, keep your current positions

53:10.367 --> 53:11.767
and prepare for a second attack.

Take a look.

54:55.667 --> 54:56.834
Yes, sir.

54:58.867 --> 55:00.133
Mr. Black.

55:02.066 --> 55:03.000
Yes.

55:05.967 --> 55:06.967
You got it.

55:07.200 --> 55:08.433
I'm on my way.

55:12.133 --> 55:13.133
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

55:13.200 --> 55:14.300
You did a great job.

55:14.367 --> 55:15.600
Thank you.

55:19.734 --> 55:21.467
That was

55:22.133 --> 55:24.166
a total fluke.

55:24.834 --> 55:26.767
We still pulled it off anyway.

55:27.100 --> 55:28.300
Does it matter?

55:29.934 --> 55:31.100
Hyun-jun Kim, Sa-woo Jin!

55:31.166 --> 55:32.200
-Yes, sir
-Yes, sir

55:32.567 --> 55:35.800
The drinks tonight are on me.
Drink until you're dead drunk.

55:35.867 --> 55:36.867
Thank you, sir.

55:36.934 --> 55:40.734
What are you doing? Mix some drinks.
Go sing some songs.

55:41.233 --> 55:43.367
Hey, nobody is going home tonight, got it?

55:57.333 --> 56:00.066
My love for you is unconditional

56:03.266 --> 56:04.467
-I told you.
-When you need me

56:04.533 --> 56:06.700
-He's a monster.
-Please call me

56:06.867 --> 56:08.633
-Keep an eye on him,
-I'll run to you anytime

56:08.700 --> 56:11.400
-or he'll turn into a dreadful monster.
-It doesn't matter on a day

56:11.567 --> 56:13.667
Or late at night

56:13.734 --> 56:16.166
I'll run to you anytime

56:17.400 --> 56:19.834
If others call me

56:20.800 --> 56:23.233
I might hesitate for a long time

56:23.867 --> 56:30.133
But if it's you I'll run to you anytime

56:33.867 --> 56:40.467
My love for you is unconditional

56:40.667 --> 56:47.633
My love for you is very special

56:54.066 --> 56:55.500
Hey, let's go for another round.

56:56.100 --> 56:57.700
Don't you like pubs with barmaids?

56:58.166 --> 56:59.133
Oh!

57:00.467 --> 57:01.533
Let's go home.

57:01.600 --> 57:03.333
What are you talking about?
We've just begun.

57:04.767 --> 57:06.100
Hey, Hyun-jun.

57:06.166 --> 57:07.133
Yes?

57:07.200 --> 57:08.100
Sa-woo.

57:08.166 --> 57:09.133
Yes, ma'am.

57:09.200 --> 57:10.233
Do I get on your nerves

57:10.867 --> 57:13.266
when I drop honorifics
although I'm younger than you?

57:15.333 --> 57:17.633
Why don't you two work hard
and be my team leader then?

57:19.133 --> 57:20.166
You must know

57:20.600 --> 57:22.066
that you're very honored

57:22.133 --> 57:23.734
to work with me.

57:31.633 --> 57:33.867
Gosh, please clean up the trash...

57:35.300 --> 57:36.200
Hey,

57:36.600 --> 57:38.266
I'll give you two special treatment.

57:40.800 --> 57:42.133
From now on,

57:43.600 --> 57:45.233
drop honorifics
when we're off the work.

57:46.767 --> 57:47.800
You won't regret it?

57:47.867 --> 57:48.934
Never.

57:49.100 --> 57:50.100
Go ahead.

57:50.166 --> 57:51.200
Okay.

57:52.100 --> 57:53.033
Seung-hee.

57:53.100 --> 57:54.633
Yes?

57:55.100 --> 57:56.533
This is awkward, but good.

57:56.600 --> 57:57.800
Good.

57:59.200 --> 58:00.867
Sa-woo, what about you?

58:02.967 --> 58:03.967
Well...

58:04.433 --> 58:06.734
I think I need more time to...

58:07.200 --> 58:09.233
Just do it when you have the chance.

58:11.033 --> 58:11.967
Come on.

58:13.266 --> 58:14.200
Seung-hee.

58:14.266 --> 58:15.567
Yes, Sa-woo?

58:15.633 --> 58:17.233
Gosh, I can't...

58:17.300 --> 58:19.800
I can't do this. Please count me out.

58:19.867 --> 58:21.433
No way. It's good.

58:21.500 --> 58:23.000
Great.

58:26.533 --> 58:27.433
We're out of drinks.

58:28.467 --> 58:29.667
Somebody go and buy some more.

58:30.166 --> 58:31.600
Why don't  you  go?

58:44.533 --> 58:45.734
Are you crazy?

58:50.667 --> 58:51.667
What?

58:57.266 --> 58:58.633
We're sorry.

59:05.533 --> 59:07.633
I got you!

59:08.300 --> 59:10.533
You were totally fooled, weren't you?

59:12.900 --> 59:14.600
I thought you were serious.

59:14.667 --> 59:16.300
Gosh, you scared me.

59:17.500 --> 59:18.867
You really scared me.

59:19.700 --> 59:20.700
I thought you got mad.

1:00:52.367 --> 1:00:53.333
Don't even start.

1:00:56.433 --> 1:00:57.567
-Your tuxedo--
-Gosh!

1:00:57.633 --> 1:00:59.033
Did you forget to bring it?

1:01:04.900 --> 1:01:07.667
BLUE HOUSE
THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA

1:01:34.700 --> 1:01:36.967
Hey, he'll be here soon. Eat later.

1:01:53.567 --> 1:01:54.567
What is it?

1:02:24.700 --> 1:02:25.700
Hyun-jun,

1:02:26.467 --> 1:02:27.834
you can't touch this.

1:02:32.133 --> 1:02:33.133
What's your name?

1:02:33.200 --> 1:02:34.300
Hyun-jun Kim.

1:02:34.367 --> 1:02:35.834
What do you want to be when you grow up?

1:02:35.900 --> 1:02:38.033
I'll become Superman
and protect the Earth.

1:02:40.934 --> 1:02:41.934
What's the matter?

1:02:44.934 --> 1:02:46.500
I think I've been here before.

1:02:47.300 --> 1:02:48.133
When?

1:02:48.600 --> 1:02:50.500
They are both nuclear physicists
who studied at MIT,

1:02:50.600 --> 1:02:52.967
and they have the core skill
that can put our nuclear development

1:02:53.066 --> 1:02:54.300
into practical use.

1:02:54.834 --> 1:02:56.300
I don't know.

1:02:56.934 --> 1:02:58.100
Are you having fun?

1:03:07.166 --> 1:03:08.600
Mommy!
