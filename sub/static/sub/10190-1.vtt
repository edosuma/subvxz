WEBVTT

00:23.907 --> 00:26.705
She's handling like a sled!

00:26.776 --> 00:28.710
What's going on
back there?

00:28.778 --> 00:31.008
Just the cargo shifting,
Captain.

00:31.081 --> 00:34.346
Check it out!

00:34.417 --> 00:38.080
Yes, sir.
I'll check it out.

00:56.272 --> 00:59.708
The hold-down straps
are tight, Captain.

01:12.422 --> 01:17.052
Captain, I think there's
something moving around in here.

01:17.127 --> 01:20.358
Dave, I bleed easy!
Look inside that cargo!

01:34.010 --> 01:36.444
What have you got?

01:36.513 --> 01:38.606
I'm trying to get
the crate open, sir.

01:38.681 --> 01:41.309
Sir, there are warning signs
all over this thing.

01:41.384 --> 01:43.318
I don't think
this is such a good idea.

01:43.386 --> 01:47.618
It's top secret, but go ahead.
You've got my permission. Open it up.

02:05.708 --> 02:08.734
There ain't nothing
in here, sir.

02:08.812 --> 02:10.746
Oh, my God.

02:13.149 --> 02:15.549
<i>Dave!</i>

02:19.322 --> 02:22.655
Dave, what the hell
is going on back there?

02:24.894 --> 02:29.797
<i>What the hell...</i>

02:42.111 --> 02:44.511
<i>No!</i>

03:05.268 --> 03:09.398
<i>Oh, yeah. Right there.</i>

03:09.472 --> 03:11.702
Oh, yeah.

03:11.774 --> 03:14.208
Oh, right there.

03:14.277 --> 03:16.211
Robert, you...

03:18.114 --> 03:21.049
- What did you say?
- Why did you stop?

03:21.117 --> 03:25.884
- You just called me Robert.
- No, no, no.

03:25.955 --> 03:29.220
- I said Roberta.
- No, you said Robert.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.726
There was no "ta"
at the end of it.

03:39.135 --> 03:41.228
Roberta...

03:41.304 --> 03:47.072
please excuse my improper
alliteration in a moment of ecstasy.

03:47.143 --> 03:51.580
I promise, next time
I will get your name right.

03:57.153 --> 03:59.587
Look, I'm sorry.

04:01.491 --> 04:05.427
I know that you
see guys sometimes.

04:05.495 --> 04:08.589
I just hope
I'm the only girl you see.

04:08.665 --> 04:11.691
You are
the only girl I see.

04:18.508 --> 04:20.772
That feels good.

04:20.843 --> 04:24.108
Oh, not so tight.

04:24.180 --> 04:26.273
Not so tight.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.783
What's too tight?

04:31.955 --> 04:34.719
- Jesus Christ, you're scaring her.
- "Scaring her"?

04:34.791 --> 04:36.725
She's just
giving you a hug.

04:36.793 --> 04:39.626
- Hi, baby.
- I don't know why you had to bring that overgrown worm.

04:39.696 --> 04:42.631
I hate that thing.
It could have bitten me!

04:42.699 --> 04:46.795
Lady G is a python.
She doesn't bite, she squeezes.

04:46.869 --> 04:48.803
<i>Besides,
I can't leave her at home alone.</i>

04:48.871 --> 04:51.704
- Wherever I go, she goes.
- Yeah.

04:53.209 --> 04:56.178
- Where you gonna go?
- I gotta take a leak.

05:37.253 --> 05:39.813
Looks like you've been
up here before.

05:39.889 --> 05:42.357
A few times.

05:42.425 --> 05:45.394
<i>- Who's John?
- John?</i>

05:45.461 --> 05:48.487
No, you mean Joanna.

05:48.564 --> 05:51.158
Bitch.

05:51.234 --> 05:53.964
- What was that?
- Nothing.

06:17.260 --> 06:19.228
Roberta?

06:19.295 --> 06:22.389
This isn't funny!

06:25.735 --> 06:27.896
Roberta?

06:28.971 --> 06:30.905
Roberta?

06:32.308 --> 06:35.402
Oh, God.
Oh, God. Oh, God.

06:35.478 --> 06:37.469
No.

06:49.826 --> 06:52.727
God, no! No!

09:24.647 --> 09:26.638
Hey, Greg.

09:28.317 --> 09:30.911
This isn't
a racing circuit, Cooper.

09:30.987 --> 09:33.046
<i>You keep riding
like that,</i>

09:33.122 --> 09:35.249
somebody's gonna get hurt.

10:19.368 --> 10:22.132
<i>Shit!</i>

10:29.879 --> 10:32.973
<i>Pretty damn funny, huh?</i>

10:33.049 --> 10:36.951
- Yep.
- There she blows!

10:37.019 --> 10:38.987
Are you out of your minds?

10:39.055 --> 10:42.616
Do you know what happens
when that goes past the red?

10:42.692 --> 10:46.355
<i>Quit screwing around
in here!</i>

10:46.429 --> 10:48.522
For Christ's sake, Brian,
leave the door open!

10:48.597 --> 10:51.031
<i>We're dying in here!</i>

11:00.376 --> 11:05.109
Take it up with the city. We leave the
big door open, we're gonna get cited.

11:06.248 --> 11:09.684
A $500-per-incident fýne?

11:10.920 --> 11:14.378
That door is the only
ventilation we have.

11:14.457 --> 11:18.154
<i>- Close that, we'll all end up with brain
damage. - You won't get brain-damaged.</i>

11:18.227 --> 11:21.287
That's what you think. You see
those two vapor monkeys over there?

11:21.364 --> 11:23.958
<i>Those two are
permanently defective.</i>

11:24.033 --> 11:27.161
I don't want to end up like that or keeled
over with some dopey grin on my face.

11:27.236 --> 11:30.137
Like Dad?

11:30.206 --> 11:35.337
- The city will close us down if we don't
keep buttoned-up. - OSHA will if we do.

11:35.411 --> 11:39.040
That's the point, John. They want to shut
us down. They're looking for an excuse.

11:39.115 --> 11:43.051
I'm not gonna let them bury everything
Dad spent a lifetime building for us,

11:43.119 --> 11:47.556
so a bunch of snobs can sit around
sipping lattes and munching on biscotti!

11:50.292 --> 11:54.854
Brian... Dad died trying
to keep this place open.

11:54.930 --> 11:57.524
I don't think that's what
he really wanted for us.

11:57.600 --> 12:00.398
What do you know about what Dad
wanted? You weren't even here.

12:05.141 --> 12:07.132
That's Tommy.
I gotta go.

12:07.209 --> 12:09.700
Then go. Leave.

12:09.779 --> 12:13.476
<i>That's what you do best,
ain't it, John?</i>

12:33.169 --> 12:35.194
Hey, Johnny,
how you doing?

12:35.271 --> 12:38.263
Great.
Peachy.

12:39.842 --> 12:43.039
<i>- Where are the girls?
- They're gonna meet us at the lake.</i>

12:49.852 --> 12:52.946
- Do you love him?
- Oh, God, of course I do.

12:53.022 --> 12:55.456
I've loved Tommy
ever since I fýrst saw him...

12:55.524 --> 12:57.754
on the monkey bars
in second grade.

12:57.827 --> 13:00.955
I've been in love with Theresa
since the time I saw her...

13:01.030 --> 13:04.397
in that tight varsity sweater
our freshman year.

13:04.467 --> 13:07.630
So when do you think he'll fýnally
get around to asking you the question?

13:07.703 --> 13:09.796
At the rate he's going...
never.

13:09.872 --> 13:13.638
All he ever talks about is sex and...

13:13.709 --> 13:15.643
Money.

13:15.711 --> 13:18.737
These days
it is all about money.

13:18.814 --> 13:20.805
- You don't care about money?
- Heck, no.

13:20.883 --> 13:23.647
I'd live in a trailer park
with Tommy if he'd ask me,

13:23.719 --> 13:25.914
but all he ever talks about
is this damn...

13:25.988 --> 13:29.651
- Kenny the Closer?
- Kenny the Closer!

13:29.725 --> 13:31.818
The man's a legend.
He's an icon.

13:31.894 --> 13:35.990
He's the number one selling real estate
agent in the entire southwestern corridor.

13:36.065 --> 13:38.499
There is no way I'm gonna ask
Theresa to marry me...

13:38.567 --> 13:41.593
until I'm pulling down bucks
like Kenny the Closer.

13:41.670 --> 13:45.003
Theresa doesn't care about
your money. She loves you, man.

13:45.074 --> 13:46.939
If that's the case,
how come she won't...

13:47.009 --> 13:49.000
You never
slept with Tommy?

13:49.078 --> 13:51.876
- Nope, not once.
- Why not?

13:51.947 --> 13:54.438
We did come close
a couple times, but...

13:54.517 --> 13:57.509
What if we get married
and the fýrst time we do it...

13:57.586 --> 14:00.612
it's like really bad sex?

14:00.689 --> 14:04.785
Tommy, there's no such thing
as really bad sex.

14:21.777 --> 14:25.880
Hey.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.518
How's your brother?

14:31.587 --> 14:35.148
Dying slowly from toxic fumes.
He just doesn't know it yet.

14:36.492 --> 14:39.086
You keep working there,
he'll be taking you with him.

14:39.161 --> 14:42.221
- Hello.
- Hello.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.226
That's what
you came back for?

14:46.302 --> 14:50.261
Nah... not for that.

14:50.339 --> 14:52.603
I never did thank you.

14:52.675 --> 14:56.873
For what, wrecking
your engagement with Greg?

14:56.946 --> 15:01.906
No... from saving me
from a big mistake.

15:01.984 --> 15:04.953
I like saving you.

15:07.923 --> 15:10.448
<i>- Come on, you weenies! Let's go!
- Tommy, you are so dead!</i>

15:10.526 --> 15:12.687
<i>Get in here.</i>

15:30.012 --> 15:32.606
John!

15:32.681 --> 15:35.081
<i>- What happened?
- What?</i>

15:35.150 --> 15:37.118
<i>Easy.
It's all right.</i>

15:37.186 --> 15:40.121
Hey.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.282
Easy, girl.
Easy.

15:42.358 --> 15:44.451
<i>John...</i>

15:45.694 --> 15:47.924
- It's okay.
- What are you doing?

15:47.997 --> 15:51.125
Easy, girl.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.998
- Oh, my God, that's Lady G.
- Who?

15:54.069 --> 15:56.003
- It's Lisa's.
- It's Lisa's.

15:56.071 --> 15:59.768
<i>- I'm not even going to ask
how both of you know that.</i>

15:59.842 --> 16:02.970
What you got there,
Cooper?

16:05.547 --> 16:07.378
That's Lisa's snake,
isn't it?

16:09.585 --> 16:11.849
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

16:11.920 --> 16:14.582
You think I came all the way
up here just to spy on you?

16:14.657 --> 16:17.820
- Didn't you?
- Guys, this is offýcial.

16:17.893 --> 16:20.191
<i>A missing persons report.</i>

16:20.262 --> 16:23.095
Lisa didn't show up
at home this morning.

16:23.165 --> 16:25.326
She's a bit
on the wild side.

16:25.401 --> 16:29.861
- You'd know, wouldn't you? You used to date her.
- Everybody used to date her.

16:29.938 --> 16:34.170
<i>Greg... Deputy Greg, come in.
We found something.</i>

16:34.243 --> 16:36.768
- Let me take that.
- Please do.

16:41.550 --> 16:44.178
God, you're such a girl.

16:44.253 --> 16:47.279
- How do you know Lisa?
- Everybody knows Lisa.

16:53.195 --> 16:56.687
So, what do you think?

16:56.765 --> 16:58.858
I don't know what to think.

16:58.934 --> 17:01.698
I don't know what
to think either.

17:01.770 --> 17:04.705
You ever seen anything
like this before?

17:04.773 --> 17:06.707
Never.

17:06.775 --> 17:08.868
Neither have I.

17:08.944 --> 17:12.209
Any idea what
might have caused it?

17:12.281 --> 17:14.374
Nothing in my mind.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.884
Nothing in my mind either.

17:26.295 --> 17:28.229
What you got, Griff?

17:28.297 --> 17:31.824
We think we found
Lisa's body. It's not pretty.

17:34.670 --> 17:37.161
Oh, no.

17:37.239 --> 17:40.231
- Didn't you used to date her?
- Everybody used to date her.

17:40.309 --> 17:42.334
Gotta tell you,
Griff,

17:42.411 --> 17:46.575
whoever pulled this one
has a real mean streak.

17:46.648 --> 17:50.880
<i>- She's burned to the bone.
- Yeah, but with what?</i>

17:50.953 --> 17:55.049
I guess an acid;
sulfuric, hydrochloric.

17:55.124 --> 17:57.524
Battery.

17:57.593 --> 17:59.458
I don't know.

18:04.099 --> 18:08.092
I won't know more
until I get her up on the table.

18:08.170 --> 18:10.730
To tell you the truth...

18:10.806 --> 18:13.866
this looks more like an
industrial accident than a murder.

18:13.942 --> 18:18.106
This was no accident. Rose and
I saw Lisa and that snake of hers...

18:18.180 --> 18:21.115
leave the diner last night
with Roberta Keeler.

18:21.183 --> 18:23.117
Nobody's
seen her since either.

18:28.657 --> 18:32.616
All I know is
burns like that don't happen...

18:32.694 --> 18:35.492
<i>just going
for a midnight swim.</i>

18:48.710 --> 18:51.144
What you got, Greg?

18:51.213 --> 18:53.477
John Cooper.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.847
Just ran into him
over at the watering hole.

18:55.918 --> 18:59.854
He had Lisa's snake
with him.

18:59.922 --> 19:04.985
He has been working over at Perfecto
with his brother since he got back.

19:05.060 --> 19:07.824
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
With all that acid.

19:07.896 --> 19:10.660
What do you think, Griff?
Worth a little talk with him?

19:10.732 --> 19:12.962
I don't know.

19:13.035 --> 19:15.333
<i>If that's Lisa,
where's Roberta?</i>

19:15.404 --> 19:18.032
Is she missing?
Did she do this?

19:18.106 --> 19:22.475
I guess it wouldn't hurt to see
what John was up to last night.

19:22.544 --> 19:24.478
- Go ahead.
- Yes, sir.

19:24.546 --> 19:26.844
- I'll get an A.P.B. Out for Keeler too.
- Good.

19:29.084 --> 19:31.848
- This is great!
- What's great?

19:31.920 --> 19:34.684
We fýnally get to grill that asshole
who stole your girl.

19:34.756 --> 19:36.690
What do you mean,
"we get to grill"?

19:36.758 --> 19:39.192
- You're not gonna grill him?
- I didn't say that.

19:39.261 --> 19:42.355
I knew it. I knew it.
Good cop, bad cop.

19:42.431 --> 19:45.525
When we are done with him, he's
gonna be confessing to the J.F.K. Hit.

19:45.601 --> 19:48.695
- When do we start?
- I got it covered, Lou.

19:48.770 --> 19:51.534
What do you mean?
You're not gonna let me help?

19:51.607 --> 19:54.201
Come on,
you gotta let me help.

19:54.276 --> 19:56.710
I promise, I won't say a thing.
I'll be a fly on the wall.

19:56.778 --> 20:00.214
- Please, please?
- All right, but you don't say one word.

20:00.282 --> 20:02.546
- Not one word.
- Not one word.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.479
<i>Now listen to this.</i>

20:07.556 --> 20:09.547
I'm supposed to be showing
the Baxter place tomorrow.

20:09.625 --> 20:12.219
Two bedrooms, two bathrooms.

20:12.294 --> 20:17.231
Six percent of 150 K,
I haven't run the comps yet.

20:18.967 --> 20:21.060
Oh, shit!

20:21.136 --> 20:23.229
What?

20:23.305 --> 20:26.240
I was gonna take some Polaroids
to go with the comps,

20:26.308 --> 20:29.243
and I left the damn camera
at the Red Stone Estates.

20:29.311 --> 20:32.246
No biggie. Just pick it up
after you drop me off.

20:32.314 --> 20:36.080
- I can't. I've gotta get back to the offýce.
- Pick it up afterwards.

20:36.151 --> 20:38.085
Theresa and I are going
to the show tonight.

20:38.153 --> 20:40.747
If we don't get out by 5:00,
there's no way we're gonna make it.

20:40.822 --> 20:45.191
- I am so screwed!
- I'll get it for you.

20:45.260 --> 20:47.751
- Would you?
- Yeah.

20:47.829 --> 20:52.698
- Thanks, man. That's very cool.
- No sweat.

20:52.768 --> 20:55.931
Hey, hey, Tommy!

20:56.004 --> 20:58.370
You gonna close the deal
on that Baxter place tomorrow?

20:58.440 --> 21:01.932
- I hope so.
- Hope is for losers, kid.

21:02.010 --> 21:06.140
<i>You gotta know so. I'm showing
Red Stone tonight, model D.</i>

21:06.214 --> 21:09.650
<i>Prospect is hot to trot!
You think I'm hoping?</i>

21:09.718 --> 21:12.414
Hell no!
Hey, hey!

21:12.487 --> 21:15.820
<i>You scratch it, I'll hang your balls
like fuzzy dice from my mirror!</i>

21:15.891 --> 21:20.294
You got that, Billy?
You piece of monkey shit!

21:20.362 --> 21:23.297
Anyway, I'm gonna
ask you one more time.

21:23.365 --> 21:26.061
This is Kenny the Closer
that's asking you.

21:26.134 --> 21:28.159
- Are you gonna close that deal?
- Yeah.

21:28.236 --> 21:30.602
- Are you gonna close that deal?
- Oh, yeah.

21:30.672 --> 21:33.835
- Are you gonna close that deal?
- Hell, yeah!

21:33.909 --> 21:37.140
That's the ticket! Cuh-ching, baby!

21:50.559 --> 21:52.823
What's going on?

21:52.894 --> 21:55.727
Somebody gone out
and got themselves murdered.

21:55.797 --> 21:58.493
- Murdered?
- Yeah, Louis told us.

21:58.567 --> 22:02.298
- Where? Here?
- No, up at the reservoir last night.

22:02.371 --> 22:04.339
<i>Lisa Johnson.</i>

22:05.440 --> 22:07.374
You know that's crazy.

22:07.442 --> 22:10.275
He may be irresponsible,
but there's no way he would...

22:14.750 --> 22:17.014
<i>Hey.</i>

22:17.085 --> 22:19.019
Brian.

22:24.626 --> 22:28.187
<i>Why don't you
sit down for this?</i>

22:28.263 --> 22:31.528
It's all right.
I'd rather stand.

22:33.769 --> 22:36.738
Where were you last night
between 10:00 and 12:00?

22:36.805 --> 22:39.399
You think I murdered Lisa?

22:39.474 --> 22:42.739
"Murdered"? Nobody said
anything about a murder.

22:44.613 --> 22:47.673
What makes you think
there was a murder?

22:47.749 --> 22:51.583
- Lenny and Boone told me.
- How did they know?

22:51.653 --> 22:53.416
They said you told them.

22:53.488 --> 22:55.888
Oh, yeah.
I guess I did.

22:55.957 --> 22:59.552
- Louis, why don't you let...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, fýne,

22:59.628 --> 23:02.597
but I'll be
watching you, mister.

23:09.071 --> 23:12.507
So?

23:12.574 --> 23:14.906
Come on, Greg.

23:14.976 --> 23:17.604
Are you gonna answer the question?
Where were you last night?

23:19.981 --> 23:22.108
I was at Kristin's place.

23:25.487 --> 23:27.455
Is she willing
to confýrm that?

23:27.522 --> 23:31.754
Of course she would.
Here, ask her yourself.

23:31.827 --> 23:34.125
You want me to dial?

23:34.196 --> 23:38.132
I know the number.

23:44.339 --> 23:46.273
<i>Yes, my liebchen.</i>

23:48.510 --> 23:50.774
Yes.

23:58.186 --> 24:00.950
Time to work.

24:07.028 --> 24:08.962
Dr. Rudolph?

24:09.030 --> 24:13.126
<i>- Yes.
- Special Agent Parker would like to see you now, sir.</i>

24:13.201 --> 24:17.638
What took you so long?

24:42.898 --> 24:46.197
Oh, Mrs. Garibaldi...

24:46.268 --> 24:48.202
you look absolutely
gorgeous today.

24:48.270 --> 24:52.001
Francesca, please.
You're so sweet.

24:52.073 --> 24:54.337
So, what have you got
for me today?

24:54.409 --> 24:57.674
Something that will
excite me, I hope.

24:57.746 --> 24:59.680
Follow me.

25:13.929 --> 25:19.526
Use your imagination, Mrs...
I mean, Francesca.

25:19.601 --> 25:24.538
- That is such a beautiful name.
- Thank you.

25:24.606 --> 25:27.541
My late husband used to
call me Fran. Can you believe it?

25:27.609 --> 25:31.045
Oh, you are anything
but a Fran.

25:31.112 --> 25:35.708
Imagine a cool winter night,

25:35.784 --> 25:41.381
you and the one you love
staring into the flames,

25:41.456 --> 25:44.550
- maybe a little incense,
- Yeah.

25:44.626 --> 25:48.392
- Candlelight.
- Ooh, you make me want it right now.

25:48.463 --> 25:51.057
Let me show you what
I've got in the back.

25:51.132 --> 25:53.896
- I'd rather see
what you've got in front.

25:53.969 --> 25:55.903
Now, now, now.

25:56.972 --> 25:59.236
The master suite.

26:08.817 --> 26:12.583
Isn't it beautiful?

26:12.654 --> 26:15.248
- Just use your imagination.
- Oh, I am.

26:20.929 --> 26:24.262
And now...

26:24.332 --> 26:26.960
my very favorite room...

26:27.035 --> 26:29.094
in Red Stone Estates.

26:40.015 --> 26:42.950
Floating camellias.

26:43.018 --> 26:45.452
Shall I?

26:45.520 --> 26:47.454
Please do.

27:34.903 --> 27:38.669
What the hell
have you gotten us into?

27:41.910 --> 27:44.344
This is horrible.

27:44.412 --> 27:47.939
- Such a loss.
- You knew those men?

27:48.016 --> 27:51.508
Not the men, the specimen.

27:51.586 --> 27:53.554
<i>You can always get more men,</i>

27:53.621 --> 27:58.058
but the specimen
is irreplaceable.

27:58.126 --> 28:03.530
What exactly
do you do, Doctor?

28:03.598 --> 28:05.691
I'm a herpetologist.

28:05.767 --> 28:09.828
- You specialize in reptiles.
- Mm-hmm.

28:09.904 --> 28:13.032
Is that was Biogene
was transporting?

28:13.108 --> 28:18.375
Not in the traditional sense,
no.

28:18.446 --> 28:21.882
What, um...

28:21.950 --> 28:26.819
What we had
was something unique.

28:27.989 --> 28:29.923
An evolutionary camera...

28:29.991 --> 28:32.858
of immense physiological scale.

28:32.927 --> 28:37.728
Something with unparalleled
abilities and characteristics.

28:37.799 --> 28:40.734
A hybrid, if you will,

28:40.802 --> 28:43.236
integrated from a variety...

28:43.304 --> 28:46.740
of distinct serpentine species.

28:46.808 --> 28:51.142
You hide behind
a lot of big words, Doctor,

28:51.212 --> 28:54.909
but what you just said still doesn't
tell us what we need to know.

28:54.983 --> 28:58.043
<i>We know the flight
originated in Southeast Asia.</i>

28:58.119 --> 29:00.713
<i>The authorization came
from the State Department...</i>

29:00.789 --> 29:02.882
for the use
of a transport out of Guam,

29:02.957 --> 29:05.755
but nowhere in the manifest
is there so much as a mention...

29:05.827 --> 29:07.920
of exactly what it was
you were transporting.

29:07.996 --> 29:13.457
So I'm asking you, Doctor,
in simple, laymen's terms...

29:13.535 --> 29:18.666
what... was... it?

29:20.008 --> 29:25.105
In simple, laymen's terms...

29:26.514 --> 29:30.450
a very big snake.

29:32.687 --> 29:36.123
<i>Oh, my God,
it's huge! It's enormous!</i>

29:36.191 --> 29:38.955
<i>- I just can't handle it! It's too much!
- Yes, you can.</i>

29:39.027 --> 29:41.086
<i>You can do it, baby.
I know you can!</i>

29:41.162 --> 29:45.496
Thirty percent down, 8.9 percent
fýnancing for the fýrst two years.

29:45.567 --> 29:49.833
- You can do it, baby!
- Oh, it's just so much more than I expected.

29:49.904 --> 29:55.069
Isn't there anything I can do
to get you to go down?

29:56.344 --> 29:58.278
All right.

29:58.346 --> 30:02.146
Twenty percent down,
8.5 percent fýnancing...

30:02.217 --> 30:04.310
with a ballooning
mortgage to 12.9.

30:04.385 --> 30:06.319
That's the best deal
you're gonna get from anybody.

30:06.387 --> 30:08.321
<i>What was that?</i>

30:08.389 --> 30:12.155
Sounded like the garage.
Damn kids are after my car!

30:12.227 --> 30:14.161
Wait here!

30:16.231 --> 30:19.667
All right! Fifteen percent down,
7.5 percent fýnancing...

30:19.734 --> 30:22.032
with a ballooning mortgage
to 12.9 percent!

30:22.103 --> 30:25.004
That's the best you're gonna get
from anybody! Think about it!

30:25.073 --> 30:27.007
Don't sign with anybody
until I get back!

30:27.075 --> 30:29.043
Cuh-ching, baby!

30:59.941 --> 31:03.536
Oh, yes.

31:21.329 --> 31:23.923
No!

31:27.135 --> 31:29.228
Billy!

31:29.304 --> 31:32.740
You little shit!

31:46.821 --> 31:50.018
<i>Billy?</i>

31:50.091 --> 31:52.753
You little creep!

31:52.827 --> 31:55.762
Your ass is mine now.

32:39.173 --> 32:41.505
Huh.

33:26.087 --> 33:28.521
Yes, I'm alone
at the Red Rock Estates.

33:28.589 --> 33:30.682
Just send a car or a truck.

33:30.758 --> 33:33.556
No, I don't know the address.
It's the big one!

33:33.628 --> 33:39.123
Listen, you little idiot, just send a car
or something. Jesus Christ, you are 911.

34:08.963 --> 34:12.899
Oh, God, no!

34:23.077 --> 34:27.173
Oh! Oh, no! No!

34:27.248 --> 34:30.081
No!

34:31.185 --> 34:34.348
No! No! No!

35:13.461 --> 35:15.452
Hello?

35:16.531 --> 35:18.465
Anybody here?

35:19.867 --> 35:21.960
Kenny?

35:25.306 --> 35:28.469
Kenny?

35:35.883 --> 35:38.147
Cool.

35:40.054 --> 35:41.988
Kenny?

35:44.058 --> 35:45.992
Hello?

36:17.425 --> 36:20.883
Why would Biogene
want a giant snake?

36:22.930 --> 36:25.956
Calling it a snake
misses the point.

36:26.033 --> 36:28.866
As I said, it was unique.

36:28.936 --> 36:32.702
Just the study of how it projects
its corrosive digestive fluids...

36:32.773 --> 36:36.140
could prove invaluable
for military applications.

36:37.612 --> 36:40.410
This thing pukes acid?

36:40.481 --> 36:43.882
You could put it that way,
yes.

36:43.951 --> 36:47.250
What it actually does is
to draw up its stomach acid...

36:47.321 --> 36:50.222
into sacs located here.

36:50.291 --> 36:54.022
Once there, it contracts
those sacs with powerful muscles,

36:54.095 --> 36:58.896
which allow it to shoot this highly
caustic acid with incredible force,

36:58.966 --> 37:01.833
much like a cobra
spits its venom...

37:01.903 --> 37:05.236
<i>to subdue its prey.</i>

37:05.306 --> 37:08.400
<i>Look at these. The
cockpit hatch was torn open...</i>

37:08.476 --> 37:10.740
<i>wide enough to birth
a whale through.</i>

37:10.811 --> 37:12.745
<i>Yes, its size
and strength were impressive,</i>

37:12.813 --> 37:16.544
but now your people
have managed to kill it.

37:16.617 --> 37:18.812
Maybe not.

37:20.521 --> 37:23.285
Looks like your pet might
have some life left in him.

37:23.357 --> 37:27.418
- What?
- There were no remains found in the wreckage,

37:27.495 --> 37:29.759
human or otherwise.

37:38.172 --> 37:42.768
It would only have eaten those
men if they were still alive.

37:48.516 --> 37:50.450
<i>Are you saying
this thing ate the crew...</i>

37:50.518 --> 37:52.611
and survived
the plane crash?

37:52.687 --> 37:55.121
Yes, it's possible.

37:55.189 --> 37:57.282
But if it's still alive,

37:57.358 --> 38:00.623
<i>- then we have a chance to capture it and perhaps...
- Kill it.</i>

38:02.163 --> 38:04.290
Agent Parker...

38:04.365 --> 38:07.391
this specimen
is a biological gold mine.

38:07.468 --> 38:10.460
The D.N.A. Alone
is worth millions.

38:10.538 --> 38:13.666
You can scrape your D.N.A.
Off whatever's left.

38:13.741 --> 38:16.005
<i>We've already lost
an entire flight crew,</i>

38:16.077 --> 38:18.011
and by now we may even
have collateral losses.

38:18.079 --> 38:20.138
"Collateral losses"?

38:20.214 --> 38:23.809
That's a rather antiseptic way of
describing death, don't you think?

38:26.554 --> 38:30.820
Keep it small. I want this solved
before anyone knows there was a problem.

38:30.891 --> 38:33.325
I'm on it.

38:35.062 --> 38:38.156
You have no idea
what you're up against.

38:38.232 --> 38:40.757
You don't know my men.

38:40.835 --> 38:46.671
This is not some
garden snake you're going after.

38:46.741 --> 38:51.508
We are talking about
a perfect killing machine:

38:51.579 --> 38:56.175
A 129-foot
all-terrain vehicle...

38:56.250 --> 38:59.413
capable of speeds
exceeding 50 miles an hour...

38:59.487 --> 39:02.012
with skin that can deflect
an antitank round,

39:02.089 --> 39:04.023
enhanced night vision...

39:04.091 --> 39:06.651
and a voracious appetite
for human flesh.

39:08.562 --> 39:13.192
It will slaughter your men
before they have a chance to blink.

39:18.939 --> 39:22.875
I don't know what it was;
some kind of big animal.

39:22.943 --> 39:27.880
- It had a tail or something... and scales.
- "Scales"?

39:27.948 --> 39:30.917
I couldn't get a good look.
It moved so quick.

39:30.985 --> 39:33.476
- What about the bones?
- "Bones"?

39:33.554 --> 39:35.818
<i>- The ones in the garage.
- Yeah, Cooper.</i>

39:35.890 --> 39:39.883
- You give old Kenny a little acid bath?
- I don't know about bones.

39:39.960 --> 39:42.724
Stripped him clean, hacked that
woman's head off with a butcher knife?

39:42.797 --> 39:45.561
- Ease up, Lou.
- Ease up, my ass!

39:45.633 --> 39:49.899
Greg found him red-handed
with the murder weapon.

39:49.970 --> 39:52.404
That wasn't a murder weapon. Knife
ain't got a drop of blood on it.

39:52.473 --> 39:54.407
He could have
wiped it clean.

39:54.475 --> 39:57.410
It had to be a big blade,
a machete.

39:57.478 --> 39:59.742
Took her head off
in one, clean shot.

40:02.049 --> 40:04.074
What about the blood?

40:04.151 --> 40:07.086
- If Cooper did it, he'd be soaked in it.
- Come on.

40:07.154 --> 40:10.248
You're buying that crap
about a big snake?

40:10.324 --> 40:13.088
Hell no!
Besides, we haven't found Roberta.

40:13.160 --> 40:15.754
For my money,
she's still a suspect.

40:15.830 --> 40:18.424
Lou does have
a point there, Griff.

40:18.499 --> 40:20.933
I mean, the bones...

40:21.001 --> 40:23.435
The only thing that can
wash them that clean is acid,

40:23.504 --> 40:27.270
and the only place in this town with
that kind of acid is their shop.

40:28.843 --> 40:30.777
Cooper.

40:30.845 --> 40:33.211
Yeah.

40:33.280 --> 40:37.341
You don't have any plans to leave
town this weekend, do you?

40:42.189 --> 40:44.623
Been dying
to use this stuff.

40:45.860 --> 40:47.794
I bet we could do that.

40:47.862 --> 40:51.457
- Maybe it just looks easy.
- Good point.

40:51.532 --> 40:54.296
I wish I had
somewhere else to look,

40:54.368 --> 40:57.462
but right now I got
only one fact to work with.

40:57.538 --> 40:59.938
There's not a whole lot
of places in this town...

41:00.007 --> 41:02.134
where a body can be stripped
to its bones.

41:02.209 --> 41:04.803
- I can't afford to be shut down.
- I can appreciate that,

41:04.879 --> 41:07.109
but I don't see any other way
to handle this.

41:07.181 --> 41:09.115
My brother's not a murderer.

41:09.183 --> 41:11.117
What's going on?

41:11.185 --> 41:13.653
We're shutting you down, Cooper.

41:13.721 --> 41:16.815
- Greg...
- Take it up with the sheriff, John.

41:18.559 --> 41:23.155
- Griff, give us a break.
- I have only one break to offer, and it ain't much.

41:23.230 --> 41:27.496
Maybe, just maybe, you won't
have to empty the tanks.

41:29.737 --> 41:32.501
- Brian, I'm...
- Sorry?

41:32.573 --> 41:36.339
Congratulations, John. You've
managed to do what no one else could:

41:36.410 --> 41:38.503
Close the doors forever
on Perfecto Plating.

41:38.579 --> 41:42.015
- This isn't my fault.
- Whose fault is it? Mine?

41:42.082 --> 41:44.016
Fine.

41:44.084 --> 41:47.349
- I quit.
- Hey, don't bother! You're fýred!

41:59.767 --> 42:04.363
Oh, no, my bike!

42:06.941 --> 42:09.535
Oh, this is great.
This is fucking great!

42:09.610 --> 42:11.703
Is there anything else
you can do to ruin my life?

42:11.779 --> 42:13.804
<i>- Don't push it, John.
- Don't tell me not to push it.</i>

42:13.881 --> 42:17.146
You take away my job.
You ruin my bike.

42:17.218 --> 42:19.311
<i>You steal my girl when I'm gone
for two seconds on a tour.</i>

42:19.386 --> 42:22.878
- You're ruining my life!
- Your life?

42:22.957 --> 42:24.925
I'm ruining your life?
Fuck you!

42:24.992 --> 42:28.758
I was set to be married. I was
gonna have a house and a family.

42:28.829 --> 42:30.729
My life was all planned
until you came back.

42:30.798 --> 42:33.596
She never loved you.
You were just a shoulder to cry on.

42:33.667 --> 42:37.626
Is that right? Maybe she did love me before
you started banging her behind my back.

42:38.973 --> 42:41.999
Take it off, Deputy.
Without the badge and the gun,

42:42.076 --> 42:45.170
<i>it's just you and me.</i>

42:45.246 --> 42:49.080
- This isn't the schoolyard.
- I heard that.

43:18.178 --> 43:20.146
<i>- You're dead.
- Yeah, so are you.</i>

43:31.792 --> 43:36.286
- I didn't steal Kristin.
- No, you just banged her.

43:49.043 --> 43:52.410
- You fýght like a girl.
- You're a sissy.

43:52.479 --> 43:55.471
- Coward.
- Dickwad.

43:55.549 --> 43:57.642
Dickwad.

43:57.718 --> 44:00.152
You okay,
Deputy Greg?

44:00.220 --> 44:03.656
Everything's fýne. Go back
and play, kids. Everything's fýne.

44:03.724 --> 44:05.783
Go on.

44:07.861 --> 44:09.852
You're a pain in the ass.

44:18.572 --> 44:20.506
Forget about it, man.
It's totalled.

44:20.574 --> 44:22.838
I'll buy you a new one.

44:22.910 --> 44:24.844
You don't get it.

44:24.912 --> 44:28.006
You can't buy me
another one of these.

44:28.082 --> 44:31.074
Why not? It's just a bike.
How much can it cost?

44:31.151 --> 44:34.177
2,400 bucks.

44:34.254 --> 44:36.188
But that's
not the point.

44:36.256 --> 44:38.656
This bike got me
out of this dust hole.

44:38.726 --> 44:40.853
It's irreplaceable.

44:40.928 --> 44:44.159
- I'm sorry, man. I had no idea.
- Yeah.

44:44.231 --> 44:47.394
This sponsor gave me
this prototype, right?

44:47.468 --> 44:52.371
State-of-the-art stuff: Shimano
brakes, grip shifts, RockShox.

44:52.439 --> 44:55.169
You know what I did with it?

44:55.242 --> 44:58.541
- I gave it to Tommy.
- You gave it to Tommy?

44:58.612 --> 45:00.876
Yep, I gave that bike
to Tommy...

45:00.948 --> 45:03.746
because this is the bike
that mattered to me the most.

45:03.817 --> 45:06.809
<i>This is the bike that gave me
what I thought I wanted.</i>

45:06.887 --> 45:10.379
You know what I got at home,
bottom right drawer?

45:10.457 --> 45:13.392
Application to Quantico.

45:13.460 --> 45:16.861
- F.B. I?
- Filled it out four and a half years ago, never sent it in.

45:16.930 --> 45:19.228
- Why not?
- Right.

45:19.299 --> 45:22.234
Some hick cop thinking
he can play Eliott Ness.

45:22.302 --> 45:24.736
<i>- It's dumb.
- Please.</i>

45:24.805 --> 45:27.899
It can't be dumber than some hick
punk thinking he could ride pro.

45:27.975 --> 45:30.273
But you did it.
You got out of here.

45:33.313 --> 45:36.908
You're not answering your radio. Some hikers
on a bike path just found another body.

45:36.984 --> 45:39.248
Sheriff Wade's already up there.
Let's roll, partner.

45:39.319 --> 45:41.810
Let's roll.

45:55.469 --> 45:58.927
Any luck on those bones
we found in the garage?

45:59.006 --> 46:01.600
I'm checking the dental records
with Hank.

46:01.675 --> 46:05.441
I'm hoping he can get a match
with one of his patients.

46:05.512 --> 46:08.140
What in the hell
could do this?

46:08.215 --> 46:11.776
I don't know.
It's weird, very weird.

46:11.852 --> 46:15.117
It's the same type
of acid death we saw earlier.

46:15.189 --> 46:19.285
Acid. Acid. Do I have
to say it again? John Cooper, acid.

46:19.359 --> 46:23.352
- What's his motive?
- Yeah, and where's Roberta Keeler?

46:27.367 --> 46:32.464
<i>- Don't need dental records on this one.
- Yeah.</i>

46:32.539 --> 46:35.099
Only guy in town that's got a fancy
watch like that is Kenny Summers.

46:35.175 --> 46:39.805
- It's a fake.
- So was Kenny.

47:02.569 --> 47:07.006
Hey, Greg, a little help here.

47:07.074 --> 47:10.703
Floyd's phone.

47:12.779 --> 47:15.179
Thank you.

47:15.249 --> 47:17.683
Hey, why are you defending him?

47:17.751 --> 47:20.151
That asshole's probably
boning your ex-bitch right now.

47:20.220 --> 47:23.018
Don't ever talk about
her like that. Do you hear me?

47:23.090 --> 47:25.854
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
- Never talk about her like that.

47:25.926 --> 47:28.520
Guys,
give it a rest.

47:28.595 --> 47:31.189
Uh, that was Hank.

47:31.265 --> 47:33.859
They made a positive I.D.
On the bones from the garage.

47:33.934 --> 47:36.061
It was Roberta Keeler.

47:39.806 --> 47:42.866
Okay, Louis, you get your wish.
You guys bring in John Cooper.

47:42.943 --> 47:45.002
Meet me back at the offýce.

47:45.078 --> 47:48.514
See, Sheriff?
I'm a thinker.

47:48.582 --> 47:50.516
<i>- You know what I mean?
- Have fun, Floyd.</i>

47:50.584 --> 47:52.552
Thanks.

47:54.121 --> 47:56.385
<i>We're gonna try
the campground at Crystal Lake.</i>

47:56.456 --> 48:00.051
If it's full,
then we'll play it by ear.

48:00.127 --> 48:03.893
Where's John?
We should get going.

48:12.306 --> 48:15.036
<i>- What happened?
- Nothing.</i>

48:15.108 --> 48:17.702
Greg and I just got
in a little scuffle.

48:17.778 --> 48:20.406
- Greg did this to you?
- Well, Greg... We just sort of...

48:22.149 --> 48:27.416
- Oh, man.
- How's it going, Louis?

48:27.487 --> 48:30.081
I'd love to tell you about my
emotional and physical well-being,

48:30.157 --> 48:33.024
but I've got some unfortunate
business to attend to.

48:33.093 --> 48:37.029
<i>Excuse me,
this might get ugly.</i>

48:37.097 --> 48:39.759
<i>John Cooper,
you are under arrest.</i>

48:39.833 --> 48:44.600
Now extend your hands.
I will frisk you downtown.

48:44.671 --> 48:48.232
- Extend your hands!
- You gotta be kidding me.

48:48.308 --> 48:50.276
No, I'm not kidding.

48:50.344 --> 48:54.610
We found Bobbie Keeler, Mr. Murderer,
Mr. Killer, Mr. Acid-Dipper of the Skin.

48:54.681 --> 48:57.946
Louis, what the hell
are you doing?

48:58.018 --> 48:59.952
I am apprehending
the suspect, Deputy.

49:00.020 --> 49:02.284
- Give me the gun.
- Pardon me?

49:02.356 --> 49:04.790
Hand it over.

49:04.858 --> 49:09.295
Now, walk to your car. Open the back
door and put the suspect in the backseat.

49:09.363 --> 49:11.797
What about the handcuffs?

49:15.335 --> 49:17.394
Everybody okay?

49:17.471 --> 49:21.100
- You all right?
- You bastard.

49:21.174 --> 49:24.473
- How could you do that to him?
- Can I talk to you for a minute?

49:24.544 --> 49:27.138
I'd love to hear
what you have to say.

49:29.883 --> 49:33.478
- Kristin...
- You probably hate him. You probably hate me too.

49:33.553 --> 49:36.647
That does not give you the right to abuse
your authority and have him arrested.

49:36.723 --> 49:40.454
<i>- Kristin, I just wanted...
- I'm the one that left you. Don't take it out on him.</i>

49:40.527 --> 49:43.826
- Okay, that's fýne.
- Am I supposed to move away from Ruby?

49:43.897 --> 49:46.422
- You want to drive me from my hometown?
- Are you done?

49:46.500 --> 49:48.661
No. You guys used
to be friends.

49:48.735 --> 49:51.533
<i>Why don't you just have it out
with each other and settle it?</i>

49:51.605 --> 49:54.836
<i>- We did.
- Because I'm not gonna... What?</i>

49:54.908 --> 50:00.073
I don't think John did it,
and I'm gonna prove it.

50:04.551 --> 50:07.520
Let me see if
I got this straight. You boys...

50:07.587 --> 50:10.681
- What department did you say you were from?
- N.S.A.

50:10.757 --> 50:15.194
- Okay. So you got this, uh...
- An operative.

50:15.262 --> 50:18.629
Yeah, an operative;
this real Rambo type.

50:18.699 --> 50:23.136
- This guy makes Rambo look
like Richard Simmons. - Uh-huh.

50:23.203 --> 50:25.501
You've had this man locked up
in a cage since 1974?

50:25.572 --> 50:27.836
In a metal box.

50:27.908 --> 50:30.206
In a metal box
in a military psychiatric unit.

50:30.277 --> 50:35.044
Somehow he escaped, and he's
the one that done all these murders?

50:35.115 --> 50:39.518
That's about the size of it.
Any questions?

50:39.586 --> 50:42.054
Just one.

50:42.122 --> 50:46.456
<i>Do you expect me to believe
this load of horseshit?</i>

50:48.628 --> 50:52.189
Let me put it this way, Sheriff.

50:52.265 --> 50:56.565
It would be highly expedient if
you would believe this "horseshit."

51:12.319 --> 51:17.416
- These cuffs are too tight.
- Oh, yeah? You're gonna have to get use to it.

51:32.372 --> 51:35.341
- Better?
- Yeah.

51:35.408 --> 51:37.603
<i>Thanks.</i>

51:38.678 --> 51:41.408
Deputy.

51:45.018 --> 51:47.111
What are you doing?
You know how this works.

51:47.187 --> 51:50.281
- Good cop, bad cop.
- Oh, right.

51:51.858 --> 51:55.624
Why don't you be
the bad cop for a change?

51:55.695 --> 51:59.654
For real?
You don't mind?

51:59.733 --> 52:04.033
This isn't some pothead.
This is a real, live murder suspect.

52:04.104 --> 52:09.974
No, I've... had my fýII
of being bad cop.

52:11.378 --> 52:14.814
Doesn't Wade keep a gun
in the drawer in there?

52:14.881 --> 52:17.315
- The suspect.
- Mm-hmm.

52:24.057 --> 52:27.493
Didn't think to check
in the desk, did you?

52:27.561 --> 52:31.998
<i>- No.
- That's right, play innocent.</i>

52:32.065 --> 52:34.431
Put this in evidence, Deputy.

52:34.501 --> 52:37.026
- It's not my gun. I didn't even touch it.
- He's right, Lou.

52:37.103 --> 52:42.837
Technicalities.
Always the technicalities!

52:42.909 --> 52:46.709
Killers screaming for their rights.
What about the victim's rights?

52:46.780 --> 52:50.614
What about the victims?

52:54.621 --> 52:58.853
- Want to call a lawyer?
- Yeah, that's the ticket.

52:58.925 --> 53:04.022
Hide behind some cap-toothed
F. Lee Cochran type sharpie.

53:04.097 --> 53:06.861
That's not gonna help
your sorry ass, boy.

53:06.933 --> 53:11.734
No, sir. Not in Ruby.
You want to know why?

53:11.805 --> 53:15.104
<i>Do you want to know?</i>

53:17.177 --> 53:20.112
<i>Because I am the law here.</i>

53:22.282 --> 53:24.716
- Cut him loose.
- Sheriff...

53:24.784 --> 53:28.413
You heard me,
Mr. L-Am-The-Law.

53:28.488 --> 53:32.788
Sorry for any
inconvenience, John.

53:37.831 --> 53:40.891
Does this mean...

53:40.967 --> 53:44.232
- Can I leave town now? I had plans.
- Yeah.

53:44.304 --> 53:46.101
<i>Fine.
Just be on your way.</i>

53:46.172 --> 53:49.573
Have a good time.
Say hey to Kristin for me.

53:49.643 --> 53:53.511
<i>Yeah, I'll do that.</i>

54:06.893 --> 54:09.327
What is this place?

54:09.396 --> 54:13.196
It's an emergency water treatment
facility, fully automated.

54:13.266 --> 54:17.293
The Army Corps of Engineers built
it underground so it'd be secure...

54:17.370 --> 54:19.361
even in the event
of a nuclear war.

54:21.107 --> 54:24.099
It'll keep your snake out.

54:28.248 --> 54:30.944
Here's the crash site.
Our position is here.

54:31.017 --> 54:33.884
Bodies have been found
here, here and here.

54:33.954 --> 54:38.050
This, we believe, is our target.

54:38.124 --> 54:40.285
You don't have
enough men.

54:41.695 --> 54:43.993
That's not your concern.

54:44.064 --> 54:47.158
This team will do
what they were trained for.

54:47.233 --> 54:51.226
After that, I don't care if you carve
up the carcass and open up a rib joint.

54:51.304 --> 54:54.398
Bottom line:
This thing dies today.

54:54.474 --> 54:57.136
You don't seem to realize...

54:57.210 --> 55:00.008
the opportunity
you are wasting here.

55:00.080 --> 55:05.814
Consider the potential
for weapons research;

55:05.885 --> 55:07.819
new neurotoxins,

55:07.887 --> 55:12.517
antidotes for those created
by your enemies.

55:12.592 --> 55:15.493
Intriguing,
Mr. Parker?

55:15.562 --> 55:19.498
I'm not as mercenary
as you may think, Doctor.

55:19.566 --> 55:22.160
I am concerned
with the loss of life.

55:22.235 --> 55:24.703
Now, I didn't know
that flight crew,

55:24.771 --> 55:27.831
<i>but once I signed on
to this scheme of yours,</i>

55:27.907 --> 55:30.171
they became my men.

55:30.243 --> 55:33.235
No one else dies because of this
thing. Do you understand that?

55:33.313 --> 55:38.341
Oh, yes, I understand.
I just hope your snake does.

55:43.923 --> 55:47.518
The satellite passes over
only once every three hours.

55:47.594 --> 55:52.588
The next pass is in 72 minutes. When
that occurs, I want us in position.

55:52.665 --> 55:55.600
<i>Once we have the confirmed location
of the target, we'll take it out.</i>

55:55.668 --> 55:59.968
- I want this thing nailed before dark.
- Excuse me.

56:00.040 --> 56:04.033
<i>What's this here,
this red line?</i>

56:05.278 --> 56:07.712
Radar echo.

56:14.954 --> 56:17.218
<i>Local law enforcement
has established roadblocks...</i>

56:17.290 --> 56:19.884
<i>at all major access points
on our perimeter.</i>

56:22.796 --> 56:25.390
<i>Dootson will coordinate
operations from here.</i>

56:25.465 --> 56:28.559
<i>I will be leading Alpha team
down this approach.</i>

56:28.635 --> 56:31.433
<i>Bravo team,
you'll flank the perimeter.</i>

56:33.973 --> 56:35.907
<i>Stay in contact.</i>

56:35.975 --> 56:40.071
<i>Once we have a lock, we'll dig in and
start shelling the hell out of this thing.</i>

56:40.146 --> 56:44.913
<i>When we have a confirmed kill,
we'll go in and mop up.</i>

57:35.368 --> 57:37.563
<i>Stand by, everyone.</i>

57:39.172 --> 57:41.800
Bird's in position,
downloading.

57:45.578 --> 57:47.773
Dootson, status.

57:47.847 --> 57:53.547
Target appears stationary at the
original coordinates; same as before.

57:53.620 --> 57:56.487
It hasn't moved
in three hours.

57:56.556 --> 57:58.649
That seem right to you?

57:58.725 --> 58:01.990
It has consumed
a great deal lately,

58:02.061 --> 58:04.495
far exceeding
its normal diet.

58:04.564 --> 58:06.657
It's possible that
the high caloric intake...

58:06.733 --> 58:11.670
has induced a respite
in its metabolic activities.

58:12.739 --> 58:14.832
Meaning?

58:14.908 --> 58:18.344
It's having
a little siesta.

58:28.588 --> 58:31.853
Let me know
when you have a visual.

58:41.134 --> 58:43.068
I've got him, sir.

58:43.136 --> 58:45.536
Visual confýrmation a quarter
click southwest of my position.

58:50.009 --> 58:52.375
Right where the bird
showed it would be.

58:57.116 --> 59:00.882
All units, lock and prepare
to open fýre on my command.

59:00.954 --> 59:03.718
It's time to put
your baby to bed.

59:09.662 --> 59:11.653
Bravo unit ready.

59:11.731 --> 59:16.065
Tactical confýrming. Both units
show in position and ready.

59:16.135 --> 59:18.569
Take her out.

59:24.310 --> 59:26.437
Sounds like a damn war
in there.

59:26.512 --> 59:30.710
- Boys will be boys.
- Sir, you want to go in?

59:31.551 --> 59:33.644
Louis.

1:00:06.953 --> 1:00:08.887
Cease fýre.

1:00:08.955 --> 1:00:11.822
Cease fýre!
Cease fýre!

1:00:19.699 --> 1:00:23.635
Target destroyed, sir.
No movement.

1:00:23.703 --> 1:00:26.968
I repeat: No movement.

1:00:27.040 --> 1:00:30.134
You're confýrmed.
All units, move in.

1:00:30.209 --> 1:00:33.303
Break out your petri dishes, Doc.
Time to clean up.

1:00:36.983 --> 1:00:41.420
- All right, let's move out.
We've got work to do.

1:00:46.392 --> 1:00:48.986
Kill confýrmed.
Target destroyed.

1:00:49.062 --> 1:00:51.826
We blew the guts
out of it, sir.

1:01:08.915 --> 1:01:10.849
It shed its skin.

1:01:13.019 --> 1:01:16.420
You knew this!
You knew it was molting!

1:01:17.757 --> 1:01:21.022
No, I didn't.
I didn't. I swear.

1:01:23.096 --> 1:01:25.155
I should turn you
into snake bait.

1:01:26.766 --> 1:01:29.564
<i>- What happened?
- It was a setup.</i>

1:01:29.635 --> 1:01:33.571
The snake shed its skin,
and the doctor knew it.

1:01:33.639 --> 1:01:35.698
No, I didn't know.

1:01:35.775 --> 1:01:40.712
I suspected, based on the surveillance
photos, but I couldn't be certain.

1:01:40.780 --> 1:01:44.876
<i>But, sir, it was here.
I saw it move.</i>

1:01:49.122 --> 1:01:51.386
We were decoyed.

1:01:51.457 --> 1:01:54.426
<i>I warned you it was intelligent.</i>

1:01:54.494 --> 1:01:57.895
I told you this isn't
just some common snake.

1:01:57.964 --> 1:02:02.458
<i>If it was here...
then where is it now?</i>

1:02:04.670 --> 1:02:07.332
Fan out! Take cover!
Protect yourselves!

1:02:24.891 --> 1:02:27.052
<i>Wait!</i>

1:02:27.126 --> 1:02:30.118
<i>What?</i>

1:02:30.196 --> 1:02:32.460
Don't move.

1:02:33.699 --> 1:02:35.633
Trust me.

1:02:42.742 --> 1:02:46.109
Stay completely still.

1:03:07.834 --> 1:03:10.268
<i>Don't.</i>

1:03:10.336 --> 1:03:12.896
Don't.

1:04:03.055 --> 1:04:08.152
<i># I met my lover
at a restaurant #</i>

1:04:08.227 --> 1:04:13.290
<i># She took my order
with a big smile ##</i>

1:04:13.366 --> 1:04:16.995
- I liked the other one better. - Yeah,
it plays better in black-and-white.

1:04:17.069 --> 1:04:19.503
- Totally.
- Hey, where's your mom?

1:04:19.572 --> 1:04:22.166
<i>Mom?</i>

1:04:22.241 --> 1:04:26.109
<i>I cut her up into tiny pieces and stuffed
her in the freezer in the basement!</i>

1:04:26.178 --> 1:04:29.238
Seriously, where is she?

1:04:29.315 --> 1:04:31.840
She's visiting her sister
in Walla Walla for the weekend.

1:04:31.918 --> 1:04:34.512
Really?

1:04:34.587 --> 1:04:37.283
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1:04:37.356 --> 1:04:39.688
So we have this place
just to ourselves?

1:04:39.759 --> 1:04:42.353
Uh-huh.

1:04:42.428 --> 1:04:47.695
So it's like...
just you and me?

1:04:48.935 --> 1:04:52.063
- Uh-huh.
- Just us?

1:04:53.606 --> 1:04:55.699
So it's like...

1:04:55.775 --> 1:04:58.710
It's just Tommy
and Theresa tonight?

1:04:58.778 --> 1:05:00.871
Uh-huh.

1:05:02.715 --> 1:05:04.979
Jesus!

1:05:05.051 --> 1:05:08.987
- What got into Caesar?
- God.

1:05:15.294 --> 1:05:17.660
You know where the couch is.
Make yourself comfy.

1:05:17.730 --> 1:05:19.823
The shower upstairs is broken,
so use the one downstairs.

1:05:19.899 --> 1:05:22.834
But I'll be there in the morning, so
don't think about checking out the goods.

1:05:22.902 --> 1:05:26.167
- But...
- I told John and Kristin we'd pick them up at 6:00 a. M.

1:05:26.238 --> 1:05:30.641
So I'd get some rest because 5:00
a. M. Comes around really early.

1:05:30.710 --> 1:05:33.008
Don't let
the bed bugs bite.

1:05:35.581 --> 1:05:39.017
"Bed bugs"?

1:05:39.085 --> 1:05:41.918
Dude.

1:05:43.255 --> 1:05:46.486
Come on, Greg, I'm tired.
I want to go home.

1:05:46.559 --> 1:05:49.585
What happened to all that
"Let's get the bad guys"?

1:05:49.662 --> 1:05:53.996
Okay, okay,
so I've learned my lesson.

1:05:54.066 --> 1:05:56.364
Which is?

1:05:56.435 --> 1:05:58.403
<i>I've got to be patient.</i>

1:05:58.471 --> 1:06:01.304
I've got to let
the evidence come to me.

1:06:01.374 --> 1:06:03.365
<i>That's right.</i>

1:06:03.442 --> 1:06:05.808
Try to get some sleep.
I'll see you in the morning.

1:06:07.046 --> 1:06:09.640
See you in the morning.

1:06:35.741 --> 1:06:39.507
Wake up.
Show time. Hey!

1:06:39.578 --> 1:06:42.513
I'm up, I'm up.
Jeez.

1:07:38.571 --> 1:07:40.505
Tommy, is that you?

1:07:46.112 --> 1:07:49.843
All right.
I'm up, I'm up.

1:07:49.915 --> 1:07:52.179
Dude.
Jeez.

1:08:25.785 --> 1:08:28.379
Damn it, Tommy! Couldn't you
have at least waited a minute?

1:08:36.662 --> 1:08:40.325
- Theresa?
- Tommy!

1:08:41.400 --> 1:08:44.062
Theresa!

1:08:44.136 --> 1:08:46.604
<i>- Theresa!
- Tommy!</i>

1:08:46.672 --> 1:08:51.200
<i>- Tommy!
- Theresa, open the door!</i>

1:09:00.686 --> 1:09:03.712
<i>- Open up the door, Theresa!
- Tommy!</i>

1:09:03.789 --> 1:09:07.122
Tommy!

1:09:25.477 --> 1:09:29.538
<i>Tommy! No, no.</i>

1:09:31.217 --> 1:09:33.777
<i>- Tommy!
- Open up!</i>

1:09:39.124 --> 1:09:41.149
The door's stuck, honey!

1:09:43.796 --> 1:09:46.663
- Tommy, get away from that thing!
- What? What?

1:09:46.732 --> 1:09:49.292
Get away
from the door. There's a snake.

1:09:51.570 --> 1:09:54.061
Tommy, get away
from the door!

1:09:54.139 --> 1:09:57.905
Dude, you got me
out of bed for a snake?

1:09:58.911 --> 1:10:01.004
Tommy!

1:10:02.081 --> 1:10:04.675
No!

1:10:12.524 --> 1:10:14.788
Tommy!

1:10:19.031 --> 1:10:22.626
Come on, come on! Move!

1:10:39.118 --> 1:10:41.052
No answer.

1:10:41.120 --> 1:10:43.554
Maybe we should
go over there.

1:11:01.941 --> 1:11:06.878
<i>Oh, God. Come on. Move, move!</i>

1:12:32.631 --> 1:12:35.862
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1:12:37.636 --> 1:12:40.799
That's Tommy's.

1:12:58.390 --> 1:13:00.324
Wait here.

1:13:12.838 --> 1:13:14.829
They're not in here.

1:13:16.341 --> 1:13:21.106
Theresa!

1:13:21.180 --> 1:13:23.580
Tommy!

1:13:27.019 --> 1:13:30.716
<i>Theresa!</i>

1:13:31.890 --> 1:13:34.950
<i>Theresa!</i>

1:13:35.027 --> 1:13:39.327
Theresa? Tommy?

1:13:46.105 --> 1:13:50.474
Theresa! Tommy!

1:13:50.542 --> 1:13:53.306
John! Kristin!

1:13:53.378 --> 1:13:56.472
John! Kristin!

1:14:01.153 --> 1:14:03.644
- John!
- Kristin!

1:14:03.722 --> 1:14:08.250
No! No!

1:14:14.500 --> 1:14:17.992
<i>John! John!</i>

1:14:32.751 --> 1:14:34.844
Go! Go!

1:14:37.022 --> 1:14:39.013
Quick!

1:14:53.972 --> 1:14:55.963
Hey, Griff, any word yet?

1:14:59.144 --> 1:15:02.375
Not a peep.

1:15:02.447 --> 1:15:05.473
<i>- You heard any more fireworks?
- Negative.</i>

1:15:05.551 --> 1:15:08.179
Maybe you should
check on them.

1:15:09.888 --> 1:15:13.756
Yeah, maybe I should.

1:15:13.825 --> 1:15:16.988
I'll wake Louis up.

1:15:17.062 --> 1:15:21.829
Wake up, sleepyhead.
Time to catch bad guys.

1:15:24.236 --> 1:15:26.295
Louis?

1:15:27.906 --> 1:15:29.840
Louis?

1:15:29.908 --> 1:15:32.536
If you're not up when I get
over there, I'm gonna kick your ass.

1:15:33.745 --> 1:15:37.476
- Hey, what is that?
- I don't know.

1:15:41.119 --> 1:15:43.053
<i>Come on.</i>

1:15:52.598 --> 1:15:55.192
Hey, slow down.

1:15:55.267 --> 1:15:57.394
Forget that.

1:16:02.541 --> 1:16:04.634
It looks clear.

1:16:09.881 --> 1:16:13.317
- What is this place?
- I don't know.

1:16:13.385 --> 1:16:15.819
<i>- No!
- You hear that?</i>

1:16:15.887 --> 1:16:20.153
<i>- Oh, yeah.
- No!</i>

1:16:20.225 --> 1:16:23.820
<i>Stupid.
So blind.</i>

1:16:23.895 --> 1:16:28.332
<i>Stupid.
Wrong. Blind.</i>

1:16:28.400 --> 1:16:31.494
<i>Who the hell is he?</i>

1:16:33.572 --> 1:16:35.506
Hello?

1:16:38.243 --> 1:16:40.677
Sir?

1:16:40.746 --> 1:16:46.651
Already I had fýxed
my gaze upon him...

1:16:46.718 --> 1:16:52.020
and he rose upright
with breast in countenance,

1:16:52.090 --> 1:16:55.856
as if he entertained
some great scorn of hell.

1:16:55.927 --> 1:17:00.762
- Python.
- He's in shock.

1:17:00.832 --> 1:17:05.292
So blind.
So wrong.

1:17:05.370 --> 1:17:10.808
Not until
I stared in its eyes...

1:17:10.876 --> 1:17:14.403
and saw the terror around me...

1:17:14.479 --> 1:17:16.811
Not until then...

1:17:16.882 --> 1:17:19.783
did I realize what I'd done.

1:17:51.416 --> 1:17:54.010
Maybe it evolved naturally.

1:17:54.086 --> 1:17:57.852
Maybe it's been out there all along
and we just never knew it.

1:17:57.923 --> 1:18:00.858
Perhaps it's some kind
of mutation.

1:18:00.926 --> 1:18:05.625
We certainly dumped enough Agent
Orange on Southeast Asia during the war.

1:18:05.697 --> 1:18:10.134
But if it has all these features from all
different kinds of snakes like you say,

1:18:10.202 --> 1:18:12.295
it couldn't have
evolved naturally.

1:18:12.371 --> 1:18:16.967
Yeah, but maybe it didn't. Maybe it was
created in some secret government operation.

1:18:17.042 --> 1:18:19.306
What? I've seen it
a hundred times in the movies.

1:18:19.378 --> 1:18:22.472
They're always
doing stuff like that, right?

1:18:22.547 --> 1:18:24.481
Actually, he's correct.

1:18:24.549 --> 1:18:28.144
We considered the possibility
ourselves. We just never knew.

1:18:28.220 --> 1:18:31.986
That's why we were so eager to get
it back to the lab to examine it.

1:18:34.726 --> 1:18:37.160
- Did we forget to lock the door?
- Lock it?

1:18:37.229 --> 1:18:39.993
- We didn't even close it.
- Shit!

1:18:49.508 --> 1:18:52.238
Theresa!

1:18:54.913 --> 1:18:57.143
What's with the towel?

1:18:57.215 --> 1:19:00.275
It got Tommy.

1:19:26.611 --> 1:19:29.478
What the hell
are you doing?

1:19:43.061 --> 1:19:45.325
Louis?

1:19:51.403 --> 1:19:53.894
Look at all this stuff.

1:19:53.972 --> 1:19:57.999
Are you telling me you couldn't
take it out with all this?

1:19:58.076 --> 1:20:01.102
<i>They never had a chance.</i>

1:20:01.179 --> 1:20:04.239
They emptied their entire
arsenal at a shed skin.

1:20:06.852 --> 1:20:11.346
There's no way the snake
could take this much heat.

1:20:11.423 --> 1:20:13.618
If you could hit it.

1:20:15.694 --> 1:20:18.128
What if we lured it
down here?

1:20:18.196 --> 1:20:20.289
Are you out of your mind?

1:20:20.365 --> 1:20:22.458
Let's just wait it out.

1:20:22.534 --> 1:20:26.800
<i>- Sooner or later, it's bound to get hungry and move on.
- You must understand,</i>

1:20:26.872 --> 1:20:29.807
it's still basically a snake.

1:20:29.875 --> 1:20:34.778
Even at its size, it could go a month
without feeding right outside that door.

1:20:34.846 --> 1:20:37.974
There's not enough food
in here for us to wait that long.

1:20:38.049 --> 1:20:42.816
And if it did decide to leave,
where do you think it would go?

1:20:42.888 --> 1:20:44.856
Ruby.

1:20:44.923 --> 1:20:48.654
Oh, my God. The whole town is
like an all-you-can-eat special.

1:20:48.727 --> 1:20:51.491
I don't want to wait around
to see what's gonna happen.

1:20:51.563 --> 1:20:54.657
So what do you say?
How about it?

1:20:54.733 --> 1:20:57.497
I say we kill
the motherfucker.

1:20:57.569 --> 1:21:00.003
Sheriff Wade.

1:21:02.007 --> 1:21:05.101
Come on, Griff.
Come on, Griff.

1:21:06.344 --> 1:21:09.142
<i>Greg, can you hear me?</i>

1:21:09.214 --> 1:21:13.116
<i>- Kristin, is that you?
- Greg?</i>

1:21:13.184 --> 1:21:17.450
<i>- Kristin, what are you doing on this channel?
- Greg, we need your help.</i>

1:21:17.522 --> 1:21:19.456
<i>Listen.</i>

1:21:23.862 --> 1:21:26.296
Wish me luck, baby.

1:21:35.040 --> 1:21:37.304
Here.

1:21:46.384 --> 1:21:48.352
Set.

1:21:48.420 --> 1:21:51.321
Set.

1:21:52.724 --> 1:21:55.318
Armed.

1:21:55.393 --> 1:21:57.486
Okay, let's go,
let's go.

1:23:32.691 --> 1:23:35.819
I'm coming through!
Get ready!

1:23:40.799 --> 1:23:44.291
- Well, that's not
gonna hold for long.

1:23:44.369 --> 1:23:46.496
<i>- No, it won't, so come on.
Get going, get going!</i>

1:23:46.571 --> 1:23:48.505
<i>- Go, go, go.
- Get Kristin!</i>

1:23:48.573 --> 1:23:50.507
<i>- Right on!
- All right!</i>

1:24:12.564 --> 1:24:14.498
Go.

1:24:57.542 --> 1:24:59.476
<i>Greg!</i>

1:25:04.716 --> 1:25:07.651
I gotta tie this to the bumper!

1:25:08.920 --> 1:25:11.821
Greg, where's the bumper?
There's no bumper?

1:25:11.890 --> 1:25:14.654
Right under there.

1:25:26.671 --> 1:25:29.071
- Now.
- I'm trying.

1:25:29.140 --> 1:25:31.700
<i>Now!</i>

1:25:31.776 --> 1:25:34.301
<i>I think it's there.</i>

1:25:35.613 --> 1:25:37.171
<i>Now, guys.</i>

1:25:37.248 --> 1:25:39.739
Go, Greg! Go! Go!

1:25:39.818 --> 1:25:42.013
<i>Come on! Now's the time!</i>

1:25:52.030 --> 1:25:54.021
<i>John!</i>

1:25:57.101 --> 1:26:02.733
<i>John, are you okay?</i>

1:26:13.718 --> 1:26:15.652
Nice job, John.

1:26:15.720 --> 1:26:19.019
Let's go, let's go!
Move it!

1:26:42.914 --> 1:26:45.348
Miss, I think
you've earned this.

1:26:45.416 --> 1:26:47.350
Thanks.

1:26:47.418 --> 1:26:51.184
This is for you, Tommy.

1:27:03.534 --> 1:27:06.992
Somehow, I thought
it would be bigger.

1:27:07.071 --> 1:27:09.005
What happened?

1:27:09.073 --> 1:27:12.133
The python must have
torn out the antenna leads...

1:27:12.210 --> 1:27:14.201
when he crashed
through the bunker.

1:27:14.279 --> 1:27:16.645
So what do we do?

1:27:16.714 --> 1:27:20.150
We have to reset the detonator.

1:27:22.053 --> 1:27:27.047
Here. Would you
please take her?

1:27:27.125 --> 1:27:30.117
Take good care
of her for me.

1:27:30.194 --> 1:27:32.185
She's all I've got.

1:27:32.263 --> 1:27:34.458
What are you talking about?

1:27:37.068 --> 1:27:39.764
Redemption.

1:27:41.940 --> 1:27:44.238
Where's he going?

1:27:46.144 --> 1:27:48.669
Doc, don't go in there!

1:27:48.746 --> 1:27:51.579
John!

1:27:54.452 --> 1:27:56.511
Um, o-okay.
Could... Sit tight.

1:27:56.587 --> 1:27:59.715
Could you take this?
You've got to be kidding me.

1:28:07.165 --> 1:28:10.464
<i>- John, come on.
- Shit! He's alone with that snake, Kristin.</i>

1:28:10.535 --> 1:28:13.003
- Come on! It's gonna blow!
- John!

1:28:54.645 --> 1:28:57.205
<i>- Take the snake! Take the snake!
- Come on!</i>

1:29:32.550 --> 1:29:35.314
Good work.

1:29:37.655 --> 1:29:40.488
- Get in the car! What kind of
Wheaties does this thing eat?

1:29:49.400 --> 1:29:54.667
All right, plan B. This thing survived
a plane crash and major explosives.

1:29:54.739 --> 1:29:56.673
It won't burn.
Can't shoot it.

1:29:56.741 --> 1:29:58.834
Any suggestions?

1:29:58.910 --> 1:30:00.844
The plating plant!

1:30:00.912 --> 1:30:02.937
The acid!

1:30:03.014 --> 1:30:05.608
Think we could dump
this thing in one of those tanks?

1:30:07.919 --> 1:30:10.752
Got any eights?

1:30:13.524 --> 1:30:17.483
- Go fýsh.
- Do you even know how to play this game?

1:30:17.562 --> 1:30:19.792
Go fýsh.

1:30:28.873 --> 1:30:30.864
- What the hell are you doing?
- No time to explain, Bri.

1:30:30.942 --> 1:30:33.809
- Let's just say there's this little...
- "Little"?

1:30:33.878 --> 1:30:36.312
Big thing after us;
actually, after the whole town.

1:30:36.380 --> 1:30:40.316
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

1:30:40.384 --> 1:30:43.615
That.

1:30:51.129 --> 1:30:54.428
- What is that thing?
- Show them where the winch controls are!

1:30:54.499 --> 1:30:56.399
- What for?
- Just show me!

1:30:56.467 --> 1:30:58.435
Go, go, go, go!

1:30:58.503 --> 1:31:00.835
- I'll bring it to you.
- No, you risked your life last time. I'll do it.

1:31:00.905 --> 1:31:03.100
Nah, it's okay. I'm getting
the hang of this thing now.

1:31:03.174 --> 1:31:05.199
All's I gotta do is get
its attention fýrst.

1:31:05.276 --> 1:31:08.439
Like this. Got your attention?

1:31:10.081 --> 1:31:12.015
Go, go!

1:31:13.684 --> 1:31:16.778
The controls are right there.
Grab that.

1:31:16.854 --> 1:31:18.913
- What do we do?
- Get a wrench!

1:31:19.991 --> 1:31:21.652
Okay.

1:31:38.109 --> 1:31:40.009
<i>Hurry up, hurry up.</i>

1:31:43.781 --> 1:31:47.182
Come on, come on.

1:32:00.464 --> 1:32:02.591
It's good!

1:32:02.667 --> 1:32:06.068
- Hit it!
- Okay!

1:32:11.909 --> 1:32:13.934
Let's go!

1:32:59.890 --> 1:33:02.620
Psst, hey.

1:33:02.693 --> 1:33:04.752
Where is it?

1:33:23.547 --> 1:33:25.606
<i>What happened?</i>

1:33:25.683 --> 1:33:27.810
Like you said,
I got his attention.

1:34:48.132 --> 1:34:56.096
<i># I canchangetheworld
Yeah #</i>

1:34:56.173 --> 1:35:00.576
<i># I can change the world ##</i>

1:35:00.644 --> 1:35:02.942
Ha!

1:35:03.013 --> 1:35:05.811
Checkmate,
you sorry son of a bitch.

1:35:05.883 --> 1:35:08.147
You used the Spassky maneuver
at the end there.

1:35:08.219 --> 1:35:11.313
Next time I'll be prepared
and use the Fischer countermove.

1:35:11.389 --> 1:35:15.155
- Very well.
- Jeez, you guys, what's it been, six hours?

1:35:15.226 --> 1:35:17.490
Get a life.

1:35:26.570 --> 1:35:29.664
Especially when being hunted
by a giant reptile with bad breath,

1:35:29.740 --> 1:35:31.674
this is the one for you.

1:35:38.582 --> 1:35:40.675
From now on...

1:35:40.751 --> 1:35:43.686
you can call me
Special Agent Larson.

1:35:43.754 --> 1:35:45.688
- You got in?
- I got in.

1:35:45.756 --> 1:35:48.350
Great. The F.B.I.'s
gonna be proud to have you.

1:35:48.426 --> 1:35:52.692
Maybe helping kill a giant acid-spitting
snake pulled some strings at Quantico.

1:35:52.763 --> 1:35:55.857
- We're gonna miss you down here.
- I'm gonna miss you guys too.

1:35:55.933 --> 1:35:59.369
It's time I went out and tried to
fýgure out some of the things you did.

1:35:59.437 --> 1:36:02.304
- Besides, it's getting a little crowded around here.
- Tell me about it.

1:36:02.373 --> 1:36:06.139
We've been swamped
since opening day.

1:36:06.210 --> 1:36:10.476
<i>A man in your condition
should not be drinking.</i>

1:36:10.548 --> 1:36:12.812
Congratulations,
stud boy.

1:36:14.385 --> 1:36:16.444
What?

1:36:16.520 --> 1:36:18.454
We're pregnant.

1:36:20.057 --> 1:36:23.993
I'm gonna have a baby.

1:36:25.229 --> 1:36:28.665
I'm gonna have a baby!

1:36:37.408 --> 1:36:40.172
<i># I can change the world #</i>

1:36:40.244 --> 1:36:42.178

1:38:15.205 --> 1:38:19.039
<i># She don't like

1:38:19.109 --> 1:38:21.634
<i># She wants what's best
for you #</i>

1:38:30.454 --> 1:38:32.820
<i># Time goes by #</i>

1:38:32.890 --> 1:38:36.724
<i># Now I find I ain't got
that much to say #</i>

1:38:41.899 --> 1:38:45.164

1:39:00.818 --> 1:39:04.948
<i># Can you still need a reason #</i>

1:39:05.022 --> 1:39:07.115
<i># Just an easy way out #</i>

1:39:08.359 --> 1:39:12.295
<i># With not much left

1:39:12.363 --> 1:39:15.958
