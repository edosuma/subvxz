WEBVTT

00:58.640 --> 01:00.360
-Hello.
-Hello, everybody!

01:00.400 --> 01:02.400
Thank you so much.

01:04.200 --> 01:06.680
-Thank you!
-Thank you.

01:06.720 --> 01:08.080
JEREMY:
Greetings!

01:08.120 --> 01:10.480
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.

01:12.440 --> 01:15.000
Thank you, everybody.
Thank you.

01:16.800 --> 01:18.360
And welcome,
and thank you all

01:18.400 --> 01:22.080
for braving these treacherous
conditions to get here.

01:22.120 --> 01:25.080
-It took me nearly
nine minutes this morning.

01:25.120 --> 01:27.240
His slippers got all soggy
on the way.

01:27.280 --> 01:29.080
I nearly fell over once,
but I made it.

01:29.120 --> 01:30.200
Don't worry,

01:30.240 --> 01:32.520
because we have an incredible
reward for you all.

01:32.560 --> 01:35.720
Because, in this
action-packed show...

01:37.080 --> 01:40.720
..James wears a red anorak...

01:40.760 --> 01:43.440
..Richard looks at a pipe
of some sort...

01:44.640 --> 01:47.640
..and I make a cup of tea.

01:51.520 --> 01:54.560
It is non-stop action.

01:54.600 --> 01:59.040
Non-stop. But...
but we begin with mankind.

01:59.080 --> 02:01.440
-Wow! Big start!
-It is a big start.

02:01.480 --> 02:03.280
You see, the thing is,
as a species,

02:03.320 --> 02:05.080
we are very pleased
with ourselves,

02:05.120 --> 02:07.680
because we have
the Porsche 918

02:07.720 --> 02:08.960
and the Ferrari TheFerrari:

02:09.000 --> 02:13.200
cars that can travel at
212mph, an incredible speed.

02:13.240 --> 02:15.800
Whereas cows and ants and...

02:15.840 --> 02:19.200
-Well, think about it, OK.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.240
A cow is exactly the same now

02:21.280 --> 02:22.840
as it was
a million years ago.

02:22.880 --> 02:24.720
Well, maybe a bit more
delicious now,

02:24.760 --> 02:25.920
but basically the same.

02:25.960 --> 02:28.480
It still stands around
all day long

02:28.520 --> 02:29.920
in a field eating grass.

02:29.960 --> 02:32.440
Whereas we think
that we've improved.

02:32.480 --> 02:34.360
But have we?

02:34.400 --> 02:35.480
-Yes.
-Yeah, we have.

02:35.520 --> 02:36.880
Well, now, you say that,

02:36.920 --> 02:40.320
but we were travelling
at way more than 212mph

02:40.360 --> 02:43.560
in our cars 25 years ago.

02:54.440 --> 02:57.320
JEREMY: This is
the Jaguar XJ220.

03:01.040 --> 03:06.120
And with a top speed
of 217mph,

03:06.160 --> 03:08.400
it was the fastest car
in the world.

03:10.240 --> 03:12.680
For about five minutes.

03:12.720 --> 03:14.560
And then this came along.

03:18.080 --> 03:23.720
The 218mph
Bugatti EB 110 Super Sport.

03:31.880 --> 03:34.960
Both these cars
were conceived in the '80s,

03:35.000 --> 03:36.920
when Gordon Gekko
was running amok,

03:36.960 --> 03:39.760
and the world
was awash with money.

03:41.240 --> 03:44.400
But by the time they went
on sale in the early '90s...

03:44.440 --> 03:46.400
An incredible day
on Wall Street.

03:46.440 --> 03:48.440
The market has fallen
over 400 points.

03:48.480 --> 03:50.880
JEREMY: ...the stock market
had crashed.

03:50.920 --> 03:52.880
There's only one word to
describe what's happening,

03:52.920 --> 03:54.440
and that is "panic".

03:54.480 --> 03:57.880
JEREMY: So, the only people
who might have bought them

03:57.920 --> 04:00.800
were too busy
hurling themselves
out of their office windows

04:00.840 --> 04:02.080
on Wall Street.

04:03.600 --> 04:07.960
So, these cars,
they came, they conquered,

04:08.000 --> 04:09.840
and no-one noticed.

04:11.200 --> 04:14.520
Today, though,
25 years later,

04:14.560 --> 04:17.960
there are only three cars
in current production

04:18.000 --> 04:19.880
that are faster than this.

04:21.120 --> 04:23.840
However, while there is
a lot of performance,

04:23.880 --> 04:26.880
the way it's delivered is...
quite old-fashioned.

04:26.920 --> 04:29.040
You put your foot down,
and then you wait

04:29.080 --> 04:31.080
while the turbo-chargers
spool up.

04:32.760 --> 04:35.120
It takes quite a while,
cos there are four of them.

04:41.200 --> 04:42.760
Talk among yourselves.

04:42.800 --> 04:46.640
However, when the 3.5l V12

04:46.680 --> 04:49.080
is finally getting
all the food it needs...

04:50.440 --> 04:52.160
Oh, God!

04:52.200 --> 04:53.920
..all hell breaks loose.

04:58.240 --> 04:59.320
Oh!

05:03.320 --> 05:04.440
Through the corner.

05:06.680 --> 05:07.840
Mild terror.

05:10.200 --> 05:12.920
The speed is hilarious!

05:15.520 --> 05:16.960
And terrifying.

05:19.240 --> 05:20.720
That's probably why
they fitted it

05:20.760 --> 05:24.000
with this plastic sheeting
rather than carpets,

05:24.040 --> 05:27.600
because they knew that one
day you would soil yourself.

05:30.560 --> 05:32.240
You did have to be good

05:32.280 --> 05:33.960
to get the best
out of this thing.

05:35.080 --> 05:37.400
Which brings me on to
Michael Schumacher.

05:37.440 --> 05:41.680
He could have had any car
he wanted back in the day,

05:41.720 --> 05:43.280
but he had one of these.

05:44.320 --> 05:45.480
Weirdly, however,

05:45.520 --> 05:47.920
and mainly because
I think it looks better,

05:47.960 --> 05:50.240
I'd have chosen the Jag.

06:01.920 --> 06:06.000
It was supposed to have been
a four-wheel drive V12,

06:06.040 --> 06:09.040
like the Bugatti,

06:09.080 --> 06:11.200
but Jaguar found that
much too complicated.

06:11.240 --> 06:13.880
So, they gave it
the turbo-charged V6

06:13.920 --> 06:15.440
from a Metro rally car,

06:15.480 --> 06:19.880
rear-wheel drive,
the rear lights
from a Rover 200,

06:19.920 --> 06:22.680
and then they said,
"That'll do,"

06:22.720 --> 06:24.880
and went to the pub.

06:29.400 --> 06:33.000
So, does that mean the Jag
is embarrassed by the Bugatti

06:33.040 --> 06:34.800
in a drag race?

06:39.280 --> 06:40.640
Right, before we do this,

06:40.680 --> 06:44.240
I have to tape
the cassette player in place,

06:44.280 --> 06:48.080
because the last time I did
a full-bore standing start

06:48.120 --> 06:49.960
in an XJ220,

06:50.000 --> 06:52.200
the acceleration
was so vivid,

06:52.240 --> 06:55.520
the stereo shot out
of its slot in the dashboard,

06:55.560 --> 06:58.760
ricocheted
off the gear lever,

06:58.800 --> 07:01.480
and then speared
into my left plum.

07:01.520 --> 07:03.520
It was very uncomfortable.

07:05.040 --> 07:06.880
Oh, the end's come off.

07:09.360 --> 07:11.760
That's good.
Right, window up.

07:27.120 --> 07:28.840
Right, let's do this!

07:50.480 --> 07:51.800
Don't know when
to change gear,

07:51.840 --> 07:53.680
because the rev counter's
broken.

07:58.960 --> 08:00.360
This is close.

08:03.280 --> 08:05.120
Oh, my word! Ha!

08:09.280 --> 08:12.040
Score one for the Jag!

08:13.040 --> 08:16.120
Whoa! That was some speed!

08:17.720 --> 08:19.240
After a quarter of a mile,

08:19.280 --> 08:24.280
the badly-made Jag
was doing 135mph,

08:24.320 --> 08:28.320
and a modern day Lamborghini
Huracan couldn't do that.

08:28.360 --> 08:33.080
Which proves that in the last
25 years, we've come nowhere.

08:34.240 --> 08:35.360
Except, we have.

08:36.960 --> 08:39.400
You see, back in '92 and '93,

08:39.440 --> 08:42.160
there was no Wi-Fi,
there was no PlayStation,

08:42.200 --> 08:44.640
DVD hadn't been invented,

08:44.680 --> 08:47.520
Justin Bieber
hadn't been born.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.920
There was no Google,
Amazon was a river.

08:49.960 --> 08:51.840
There was no
internet pornography.

08:51.880 --> 08:53.360
Well, that's probably
a good thing,

08:53.400 --> 08:54.880
cos there was no Viagra,
either.

08:54.920 --> 08:57.640
The early '90s
were the dark ages,

08:57.680 --> 09:01.360
and when you drive
these cars, it shows.

09:10.960 --> 09:13.720
In here,
there's no power-steering.

09:14.880 --> 09:16.000
No air conditioning.

09:17.240 --> 09:18.600
No anti-lock brakes.

09:20.800 --> 09:24.080
And obviously,
no driver aids of any kind.

09:29.920 --> 09:34.360
Got a 525bhp engine
back there.

09:38.480 --> 09:39.600
Ooh, shi...

09:41.520 --> 09:45.320
Being fed by a turbo-charger
the size of a wheelie bin.

09:48.400 --> 09:52.880
And all there is in here
to tame it is me!

10:00.360 --> 10:01.560
Ah!

10:03.000 --> 10:04.120
Oh!

10:09.600 --> 10:11.680
After a couple of laps
in this thing,

10:11.720 --> 10:13.560
you really are aching.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.040
And sweating.

10:15.080 --> 10:17.320
And you're frightened.
You really are.

10:17.360 --> 10:20.920
Cos this is not a car that's
just gonna forgive you.

10:20.960 --> 10:24.440
If you overdo it,
you're gonna hit a tree,

10:24.480 --> 10:26.240
and that's just an end of it.

10:39.040 --> 10:40.760
So, there we are.

10:43.120 --> 10:45.160
A modern supercar
may be no faster

10:45.200 --> 10:47.720
than these monsters
from the past,

10:47.760 --> 10:51.640
but a modern supercar
makes the speed fun and easy,

10:51.680 --> 10:57.240
not terrifying
and bathed in an unholy mix
of sweat and faeces.

11:04.960 --> 11:06.320
Well done.

11:07.320 --> 11:08.400
Covered it all there.

11:09.560 --> 11:10.680
No, seriously, well done,

11:10.720 --> 11:12.600
because nobody's ever
finished a road test

11:12.640 --> 11:14.480
with the word "faeces"
before.

11:14.520 --> 11:15.720
No, that was a first.

11:15.760 --> 11:16.880
But I'm just thinking,

11:16.920 --> 11:19.320
it isn't just supercars
that are getting slower,

11:19.360 --> 11:21.320
because you remember
the Lotus Sunbeam?

11:21.360 --> 11:24.160
-Yeah.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.920
That did 0-60 in 6.6 seconds,

11:26.960 --> 11:28.240
and there aren't many
hot hatches

11:28.280 --> 11:29.920
that would keep up with that,
even today.

11:29.960 --> 11:32.200
And then you've got trains.
The Mallard, the steam train,

11:32.240 --> 11:33.640
is quicker
than most electric trains.

11:33.680 --> 11:37.560
SR-71 Blackbird, nothing
in the skies as fast as that.

11:37.600 --> 11:38.880
I suppose,
if you think about it,
we used to be able

11:38.920 --> 11:41.000
to get across the Atlantic
in three hours,

11:41.040 --> 11:42.800
-and now it takes us seven.
-Exactly.

11:42.840 --> 11:45.760
And now we must put some
numbers on our argument

11:45.800 --> 11:49.480
by sending the Bugatti
round the Eboladrome.

11:51.400 --> 11:53.040
Come on, old-timer!

11:55.000 --> 11:57.080
JEREMY: And she's off.

11:57.120 --> 11:58.200
A smooth start.

11:58.240 --> 12:00.600
Four-wheel drive system
maintaining traction

12:00.640 --> 12:03.520
in these wet conditions.

12:03.560 --> 12:06.200
It really is soaking
out there today!

12:06.240 --> 12:09.760
Right, a measured line
through the first curve,

12:09.800 --> 12:12.240
and then carefully
working the throttle

12:12.280 --> 12:14.000
to keep things in check.

12:14.040 --> 12:16.600
Approaching the sweep
down to Your Name Here,

12:16.640 --> 12:18.240
and smoothly done.

12:19.680 --> 12:22.560
Crikey! Managing to get
the tyres squealing,

12:22.600 --> 12:24.760
even on this damp section.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.920
And then winding up
the little V12

12:26.960 --> 12:30.200
to fire it back
onto the Isn't.

12:30.240 --> 12:32.880
Single wiper
batting away the drizzle,

12:32.920 --> 12:35.040
as she hustles it
towards the braking zone

12:35.080 --> 12:38.040
for the tricky
Old Lady's House complex.

12:38.080 --> 12:40.080
How will it get on here?

12:40.120 --> 12:41.800
Very neat.

12:41.840 --> 12:44.160
Very controlled.

12:44.200 --> 12:47.760
And now back on the gas
for the run to Substation.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.640
And you can hear the fizz

12:49.680 --> 12:52.680
from those four
furiously spinning turbos.

12:52.720 --> 12:55.000
Keeping it together there
nicely.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.200
Field Of Sheep to go.

12:56.240 --> 12:58.520
Glides through there,
and across the line.

13:04.640 --> 13:07.680
So, let's see where
it goes on the board.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.360
I'm imagining pretty high up.

13:09.400 --> 13:10.560
Oh.

13:11.880 --> 13:13.720
-That's not very fast.
-No, it isn't very fast.

13:13.760 --> 13:16.000
But we put the Jag round,
as well,

13:16.040 --> 13:17.480
and that did it in...

13:17.520 --> 13:19.800
Hang on,
I've got the time here.
Just bear with me.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.840
..one thirty-five one.

13:21.880 --> 13:24.920
JAMES: So...
slower than the Bugatti?

13:24.960 --> 13:26.800
Yes.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.240
Slower, in fact,
than everything

13:28.280 --> 13:30.800
except a small, cheap
Volkswagen hatchback,

13:30.840 --> 13:33.120
which also went round
in the soaking wet.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.600
Yes.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.440
So, contrary to what
you were saying earlier on,

13:37.480 --> 13:39.680
supercars have got
much faster

13:39.720 --> 13:41.600
over the last 25 years.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.280
Yes.

13:45.320 --> 13:46.760
Right! Moving on!

13:46.800 --> 13:48.280
Because now it's time

13:48.320 --> 13:50.600
to order
some doughnuts of debate

13:50.640 --> 13:55.640
from the Chat Café,
on Conversation Street.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.480
-I was terrified.
-Yeah.

14:04.520 --> 14:05.840
Right, good. Now...

14:06.960 --> 14:09.080
-Yes.

14:09.120 --> 14:10.200
The only car, incidentally,

14:10.240 --> 14:13.160
designed on the interior
and the exterior by women.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.280
-It was.

14:14.320 --> 14:17.240
Well, they're dropping it,
and replacing it with this.

14:17.280 --> 14:20.080
This has been designed
by a man, so...

14:20.120 --> 14:23.240
Mm-hm. And where are you
going with this one, Jeremy?

14:23.280 --> 14:27.520
So, it won't be able
to take its jumper off

14:27.560 --> 14:29.360
by folding its arms.

14:31.760 --> 14:34.760
Men can't take their jumpers
off like women do,

14:34.800 --> 14:37.360
-crossing their arms.
-I can do that!

14:37.400 --> 14:40.320
-You're not a man.
-Oh, right.

14:40.360 --> 14:41.560
I take my jumper...

14:41.600 --> 14:43.480
That's how you take
a jumper off, like that.

14:43.520 --> 14:45.000
How do you know?

14:45.040 --> 14:47.280
You just wait for the
paramedics to come along,

14:47.320 --> 14:49.160
cut it off
after your accident.

14:49.200 --> 14:51.480
Yes, but that's how
you take a jumper off.

14:51.520 --> 14:53.880
-I don't know
what you're talking about.
-Take your jumper off.

14:53.920 --> 14:56.920
Just take your jumper off.
Watch this.
How does he take it off?

14:56.960 --> 14:58.360
Er, like this.

14:58.400 --> 14:59.800
JEREMY: There, you see?
Like a man.

14:59.840 --> 15:01.320
Are there any women
wanna take...

15:01.360 --> 15:03.840
Oh, no, we can't do that.

15:03.880 --> 15:06.200
Seriously, women, do you know
what I'm on about?

15:06.240 --> 15:07.440
WOMEN: Yes.

15:07.480 --> 15:08.560
Women cross...

15:08.600 --> 15:11.200
If I tried to do that,
I'd dislocate my shoulder!

15:11.240 --> 15:13.440
Thank you for that nonsense,
Jeremy.

15:13.480 --> 15:16.480
Can we maybe get back to
the BMW now, which is a car?

15:16.520 --> 15:17.800
Yes, it is.
Now, I have to say,

15:17.840 --> 15:19.960
the old one was never
as good to drive

15:20.000 --> 15:21.640
-as it was to look at.
-I know what you mean.

15:21.680 --> 15:23.360
It wasn't. It was sort of
baggy, wasn't it?

15:23.400 --> 15:25.000
Yeah, and there was never
an M version.

15:25.040 --> 15:27.200
You know,
it was all just unexciting.

15:27.240 --> 15:28.920
But I'm hoping this new one

15:28.960 --> 15:30.640
is as good to drive
as it looks,

15:30.680 --> 15:32.120
and it does look very good,

15:32.160 --> 15:34.640
-even though it will struggle
with its jumper.
-Yeah, whatever.

15:34.680 --> 15:37.280
Anyway, if I was looking
for a new BMW Z4,

15:37.320 --> 15:40.200
actually, I'd have
one of these,

15:40.240 --> 15:41.880
because this is
the new Toyota Supra.

15:41.920 --> 15:43.400
I know, it looks phenomenal!

15:43.440 --> 15:46.000
And that underneath
is basically a Z4.

15:46.040 --> 15:47.960
-Same engine and everything.
-Same chassis.

15:48.000 --> 15:49.640
It is a Z4,
but with that body.

15:49.680 --> 15:51.560
And that body,
I have to say, looks amazing.

15:51.600 --> 15:53.240
And do you know
the most amazing thing is,

15:53.280 --> 15:55.520
they're talking about a price
between 40,000 and 60,000,

15:55.560 --> 15:57.560
which is much less
than it looks like.

15:57.600 --> 16:00.200
RICHARD: See, I think
that is actually filling
a gap in the market.

16:00.240 --> 16:03.200
There is a need right now
for a mid-price sportscar,

16:03.240 --> 16:05.520
because there really
aren't many, if any.

16:05.560 --> 16:07.160
There's the Audi TT RS.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.960
Well, that'll definitely
take its jumper off
like that, won't it?

16:10.000 --> 16:11.720
And then stow it
in the overhead lockers,

16:11.760 --> 16:13.720
tell you where the doors are.

16:13.760 --> 16:15.760
Now, Volkswagen's
US Head of Regulation -

16:15.800 --> 16:18.800
that was his job title -
a guy called Oliver Schmidt.

16:18.840 --> 16:21.520
He's just been done
for his part in Dieselgate.

16:21.560 --> 16:24.480
And they've given him
seven years in jail.

16:24.520 --> 16:26.680
Or, as he would put it,
4.2 years.

16:32.080 --> 16:33.760
And a fine of £400,000,

16:33.800 --> 16:35.920
or whatever that translates
into VW money.

16:35.960 --> 16:38.640
Two hundred
and seventy thousand.

16:38.680 --> 16:42.080
The fascinating thing is,
there was a warrant out
for his arrest in America,

16:42.120 --> 16:43.400
but he was in Germany.

16:43.440 --> 16:45.000
And then, for some reason,

16:45.040 --> 16:48.320
he decided to take his
annual holiday in Florida,

16:48.360 --> 16:49.800
and got arrested
at the airport.

16:49.840 --> 16:52.120
"Oh, nein!"

16:54.240 --> 16:55.520
-Oh, yeah.
-Well, he must be!

16:55.560 --> 16:57.520
He must be!
The only thing I can think of

16:57.560 --> 17:00.920
is that Volkswagen needed
someone to do some jail time

17:00.960 --> 17:03.200
-for what had happened.

17:03.240 --> 17:04.600
No, I reckon
they probably said,

17:04.640 --> 17:06.600
"You are ze employee
of ze month, Mr Schmidt,

17:06.640 --> 17:08.800
and you have won
a fortnight's holiday

17:08.840 --> 17:10.280
in Disney World!"

17:10.320 --> 17:12.680
-"Ah, danke!"
-And off he toddled.

17:12.720 --> 17:15.040
"Oh, no,
they have arrested me!"

17:15.080 --> 17:18.520
That's actually a seven-year
holiday, Mr Schmidt,

17:18.560 --> 17:20.880
and the catering is terrible.

17:20.920 --> 17:22.760
Now, do you remember
the Rimac we had

17:22.800 --> 17:24.200
in programme one
of this season?

17:24.240 --> 17:25.440
-There it is.
JEREMY: Yeah.

17:25.480 --> 17:28.320
RICHARD: Well,
they've announced there is
a new one coming out.

17:28.360 --> 17:31.080
Well, what happened
to that one?

17:31.120 --> 17:33.680
No, that was called
the Concept One.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.960
JEREMY: Mm-hm.
-And they only made
eight of those, actually.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.360
-Seven. Shut up!

17:38.400 --> 17:39.680
What happened
to the other one, Hammond?

17:39.720 --> 17:41.400
Just stop saying things!

17:41.440 --> 17:43.360
The new one is gonna be
called the Concept Two,

17:43.400 --> 17:46.200
and amazingly they're saying
it's gonna be even faster,

17:46.240 --> 17:47.680
and that was blindingly fast.

17:47.720 --> 17:49.760
I actually don't believe
that you can make a car go...

17:49.800 --> 17:51.160
Well, they say
it's gonna be faster,

17:51.200 --> 17:52.360
and it's a bit bigger inside.

17:52.400 --> 17:53.960
Which you did need, cos
that one was quite cramped.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.960
-You can fit in this one.
-I could fit in the last one.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.360
You'd be less like Spam,
though,

17:57.400 --> 17:59.080
if you rolled it
over and over and over.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.800
It should be more dangerous,
you're right.

18:00.840 --> 18:02.480
We've actually got a picture
of the new Concept Two.

18:02.520 --> 18:04.400
Here it is, Hammond.
You'll like this.

18:04.440 --> 18:06.920
RICHARD: Oh, God.

18:08.240 --> 18:10.000
Ooh, now,
there's a new McLaren, OK?

18:10.040 --> 18:11.520
I've got a picture
of it here.

18:11.560 --> 18:14.400
This is staggering. OK?
I've got some of the details.

18:14.440 --> 18:17.360
It's their new flagship,
kinda replaces the P1.

18:17.400 --> 18:22.240
Super hard-core.
789 horsepower mentalist
that thing.

18:22.280 --> 18:24.880
And they've called it...
And this is
a tremendous name, I think.

18:24.920 --> 18:26.920
-They've called it the Senna.
RICHARD: Ooh, cool.

18:26.960 --> 18:29.000
JEREMY: I mean,
that is a really cool name
for a car like that.

18:29.040 --> 18:31.120
I'm glad they didn't
call it the Mansell.

18:31.160 --> 18:33.640
-No, less cool.
-With its droning
engine note.

18:33.680 --> 18:36.480
And it would have
a stupid moustache
above its number place.

18:36.520 --> 18:39.560
And if it were a convertible,
a tweed roof.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.280
McLaren Hunt could work,
cos he was quite cool.

18:43.320 --> 18:44.920
A terrible thirst, though,
it would have.

18:44.960 --> 18:46.240
Yeah, a lot of smoke
coming out.

18:46.280 --> 18:49.680
Every now and again it would
try and mount another car.
But it'd be cool.

18:49.720 --> 18:51.840
On balance, I think Senna's
probably the best name

18:51.880 --> 18:53.200
they could have come up with.

18:53.240 --> 18:55.080
Right. Now, what else?
What more conversation
have we got?

18:55.120 --> 18:57.280
-I have some conversation.

18:57.320 --> 18:58.960
You know last week,
you were talking about

18:59.000 --> 19:00.440
how you ended up
following a pigeon?

19:00.480 --> 19:03.480
-How fast did you
reckon it was going?

19:03.520 --> 19:04.720
Thirty-five,
I think you said.

19:04.760 --> 19:06.480
The other day, I was going
down a country lane

19:06.520 --> 19:07.960
and I ended up following
a blackbird,

19:08.000 --> 19:10.920
and that only does 28.

19:10.960 --> 19:13.920
And that's interesting,
cos that means a blackbird,
in level flight,

19:13.960 --> 19:15.240
is slower than a pigeon.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.560
What is wrong with you two?

19:17.600 --> 19:18.880
Why are you following birds?

19:18.920 --> 19:20.920
Why not follow Russian spies
or straying husbands?

19:20.960 --> 19:22.920
No, listen, Hammond.
Pay attention.

19:22.960 --> 19:24.760
RICHARD: Oh, God.
-I did some research on this.

19:24.800 --> 19:26.760
You know
the top speed of a pigeon,

19:26.800 --> 19:28.600
if it really puts
its foot down, is 90,

19:28.640 --> 19:29.880
in level flight.

19:29.920 --> 19:32.400
-Ninety miles an hour!
That is amazing,

19:32.440 --> 19:34.880
cos you wouldn't think
a pigeon's wings
could shift enough air.

19:34.920 --> 19:37.480
-No, I wouldn't think
about it!
-No, no, stop!

19:37.520 --> 19:40.960
You say that: a hummingbird
can fly faster than a goose.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.880
JAMES: Can it?
-Even though it's like that.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.320
-Nobody cares!
-They do!

19:44.360 --> 19:46.640
Stop ranking birds!

19:46.680 --> 19:47.800
What?

19:47.840 --> 19:50.280
-R-r-r-ranking.

19:50.320 --> 19:54.360
Anyway, I think
that the top speed of birds
is a new hit show.

19:54.400 --> 19:55.600
And you and I can host it,

19:55.640 --> 19:59.280
and you'll end up as Buttons
in panto in Swindon.

19:59.320 --> 20:00.640
And then
you'll shoot yourself

20:00.680 --> 20:02.480
in a room
in a Premier Inn one night.

20:02.520 --> 20:04.680
-Yeah.
-There'll only be
one police car outside,

20:04.720 --> 20:06.160
and it'll be
a Vauxhall Astra.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.360
That's your future!

20:08.400 --> 20:11.080
Anyway, that is enough
Conversation Street this week,
so let's move it on.

20:11.120 --> 20:12.840
Thank you very much.

20:17.280 --> 20:19.080
Now...
Now, as I'm sure you know,

20:19.120 --> 20:23.000
trying to set a speed record
is very, very dangerous,

20:23.040 --> 20:25.520
and especially if you try
to do it on water.

20:25.560 --> 20:28.640
In fact, over the years,
and this is a true fact,

20:28.680 --> 20:30.520
85% of everyone

20:30.560 --> 20:33.760
who's tried to break
a speed record on water

20:33.800 --> 20:35.640
has been killed
in the process.

20:35.680 --> 20:37.840
-Eighty-five percent!
-Yeah.

20:37.880 --> 20:40.320
But that's not the sort
of figure that puts us off!

20:40.360 --> 20:44.560
Exactly. Because there was
a 15% chance of surviving it,

20:44.600 --> 20:48.560
we decided to try and break
the UK speed record

20:48.600 --> 20:50.600
for amphibious vehicles.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.760
Yeah, first, though,
we had to build a car

20:52.800 --> 20:55.600
that could be driven legally
on the road,

20:55.640 --> 20:58.240
but that would also go
very quickly on the water.

20:58.280 --> 21:00.160
Mm. And how hard can that be?

21:02.240 --> 21:03.600
JEREMY:
Since we were trying to break

21:03.640 --> 21:05.760
an amphibious
speed record,

21:05.800 --> 21:08.120
the obvious
starting point...was here.

21:09.920 --> 21:12.680
At Huddersfield
International Airport.

21:15.680 --> 21:18.600
Why are we at Huddersfield
International Airport?

21:18.640 --> 21:20.000
Yeah,
why aren't we at a lake?

21:20.040 --> 21:21.960
Because I'm project leader,

21:22.000 --> 21:24.600
and one of the many, many
things that I know

21:24.640 --> 21:27.120
is that to go fast on water,

21:27.160 --> 21:30.280
you have to have
a lot of power.

21:31.520 --> 21:34.080
To demonstrate
what I was on about,

21:34.120 --> 21:35.240
I'd set up a test,

21:35.280 --> 21:38.800
using the jet engine
from an RAF Nimrod.

21:43.760 --> 21:45.080
-Yes.

21:45.120 --> 21:46.760
JAMES: Can I just ask...
JEREMY: What?

21:46.800 --> 21:50.480
...what is the current
speed record
for amphibious vehicles?

21:50.520 --> 21:53.560
Thirty-nine point one
miles an hour.

21:53.600 --> 21:56.960
Well, isn't this
rather overkill?

21:57.000 --> 22:01.480
Listen, Usain Bolt can run
at 27mph on land, OK?

22:01.520 --> 22:03.320
If he were waist-deep
in water,

22:03.360 --> 22:05.120
he'd have a top speed
of about one.

22:05.160 --> 22:08.080
Water's really sticky,
you need loads of power.

22:08.120 --> 22:11.360
I've got a word in my head
for all this,
and it's "impractical".

22:11.400 --> 22:12.760
I've got a word,
it's "shut up".

22:12.800 --> 22:13.880
-All right.
-We're going.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.760
-Very.

22:17.800 --> 22:20.720
-That's fired up.

22:20.760 --> 22:22.720
That's gonna drive air
into the big engine.

22:22.760 --> 22:25.480
-We've gotta get those
in the green.

22:25.520 --> 22:27.480
I hate it
when you've got buttons.

22:27.520 --> 22:29.440
I can't hear anything.

22:29.480 --> 22:31.400
Ignitors on.

22:32.880 --> 22:35.240
I'm gonna give it
some thrust now.

22:46.880 --> 22:49.120
Gonna go up to 100% power.

23:33.080 --> 23:35.320
JAMES:
You are a witless dodo!

23:35.360 --> 23:37.080
RICHARD: Look at it!

23:41.040 --> 23:42.120
JEREMY: Ah!

23:42.160 --> 23:45.600
On the upside -
there is an upside here -

23:45.640 --> 23:48.520
if it's capable
of doing that,

23:48.560 --> 23:51.560
imagine how fast
we're gonna go on the lake.

23:51.600 --> 23:53.160
-You're a cretin.
-Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

23:53.200 --> 23:55.720
None of this is based
on any scientific reasoning
whatsoever.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.240
You say,
"It's got a lot of power."

23:57.280 --> 23:58.720
"How much thrust has it got?"
"A lot!"

23:58.760 --> 24:00.560
Look what it's done,
it's blown two aeroplanes over

24:00.600 --> 24:02.040
and given us
a massive bill...

24:02.080 --> 24:04.760
JEREMY: Having proved
to my sceptical colleagues

24:04.800 --> 24:06.640
that jet power
was the way forward,

24:06.680 --> 24:11.120
we moved
to our technology centre.

24:11.160 --> 24:14.680
Here, we would fuse together
this Russian jet...

24:16.040 --> 24:17.160
..this speedboat...

24:18.320 --> 24:20.000
..and this Suzuki Jimny,

24:20.040 --> 24:23.400
and we'd end up with the
fastest amphibious vehicle

24:23.440 --> 24:25.200
Britain had ever seen.

24:26.640 --> 24:29.280
-We have an old Suzuki car.
JEREMY: Yes.

24:29.320 --> 24:32.200
A small, old, plastic boat
and a jet engine.

24:32.240 --> 24:34.520
And you're suggesting that
somehow we unite them all

24:34.560 --> 24:36.960
into some sort of symphony
of success and glory?

24:37.000 --> 24:38.200
Yes.

24:38.240 --> 24:41.200
This is the stupidest thing
I've ever been involved with.

24:41.240 --> 24:43.560
JAMES: It's idiotic.

24:43.600 --> 24:46.520
JEREMY: Having convinced
my sceptical colleagues
once more

24:46.560 --> 24:50.160
that my plan was a good one,
we set to work.

24:56.280 --> 25:00.120
And soon, our amazing
creation was ready.

25:22.200 --> 25:23.880
Right, as you can see,
everyone,

25:23.920 --> 25:25.760
this is fully road legal.

25:25.800 --> 25:28.600
Lights, indicators,
number plate.

25:28.640 --> 25:30.560
And a massive jet engine
just behind us.

25:30.600 --> 25:31.720
JEREMY: Yes.

25:31.760 --> 25:33.800
RICHARD:
More of an issue, though,

25:33.840 --> 25:36.240
was the passenger's
seat layout.

25:36.280 --> 25:37.360
I've gotta change gear,

25:37.400 --> 25:39.400
and it's right where
your penis is.

25:39.440 --> 25:42.480
I never want your hand that
near my gentleman's sausage!

25:45.800 --> 25:47.640
RICHARD: What are these things
above our heads exactly?

25:47.680 --> 25:49.400
These are the
stabilisation tanks, yeah?

25:49.440 --> 25:52.160
When we go in the water,
you lower them down
and they keep us afloat.

25:52.200 --> 25:54.360
I've got that. I've got that
when we fitted them,

25:54.400 --> 25:55.800
but what
we're now discovering

25:55.840 --> 25:57.840
is they make us more stable
on water,

25:57.880 --> 25:59.760
but a lot less on land!

25:59.800 --> 26:01.560
JEREMY: James,
why are you being so quiet?

26:01.600 --> 26:03.200
JAMES: I'm waiting for it
to fall over.

26:03.240 --> 26:05.320
JAMES AND RICHARD: Whoa!

26:05.360 --> 26:09.400
Will you stop making
stupid, childish noises!

26:09.440 --> 26:12.280
I think we've done
an incredible job,

26:12.320 --> 26:15.600
and I think I've been
a remarkable project leader.

26:15.640 --> 26:18.600
Why has no-one
thought to do this before?

26:18.640 --> 26:20.480
It's so logical
when you look at it.

26:22.120 --> 26:24.400
The car bit of it's working,
but it was already a car.

26:24.440 --> 26:26.080
That's not much
of an achievement.

26:27.560 --> 26:29.280
I'm gonna do a brake test.

26:29.320 --> 26:31.120
Ah! Oh! Oh.

26:31.160 --> 26:32.360
-Wait.

26:32.400 --> 26:33.480
Is that that...

26:33.520 --> 26:34.680
-Ooh!
-Oh!

26:34.720 --> 26:35.840
Yeah.

26:38.120 --> 26:40.680
JEREMY: Eventually,
we arrived at the lake.

26:43.440 --> 26:46.400
For our first
high-speed test run.

26:47.840 --> 26:51.240
And immediately,
Hammond chickened out.

26:53.360 --> 26:55.040
Why aren't you wearing
a fire suit?

26:55.080 --> 26:58.320
Um, jet engines
just aren't my thing.

26:58.360 --> 27:00.240
I'm gonna watch this
from the bank.

27:00.280 --> 27:01.720
Are you really
not coming in it?

27:01.760 --> 27:04.280
No, I'm gonna watch--
I'm gonna be the observer.

27:04.320 --> 27:05.800
Oof!

27:13.040 --> 27:14.680
JEREMY: Oh. She's ready.

27:15.680 --> 27:18.080
My big fear is,
let's be modest

27:18.120 --> 27:20.560
and let's say we reached 80.

27:20.600 --> 27:24.360
So from here, we've got to
just use drag to slow us down

27:24.400 --> 27:25.600
before we hit the far bank.

27:25.640 --> 27:28.240
Well,
we have to think ahead, yes.

27:28.280 --> 27:31.000
Start decelerating
when you pass that mid-point,

27:31.040 --> 27:33.080
-you should be all right.
JAMES: I think he's right.

27:33.120 --> 27:34.480
The middle
is the critical point.

27:34.520 --> 27:36.160
RICHARD: Then just back off
the throttles.

27:36.200 --> 27:38.960
-And then we'll use the drag of
the pontoons to slow us down?
-Yeah.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.560
OK.

27:40.600 --> 27:42.920
Right.

27:42.960 --> 27:46.160
JEREMY: Soon, James and I
were ready for the test,

27:46.200 --> 27:48.000
and not at all nervous.

27:49.640 --> 27:53.880
When we fire up the jet,
this Perspex
that I put in here,

27:53.920 --> 27:55.680
I put it in.

27:55.720 --> 27:58.000
So what if that just goes?

27:58.040 --> 27:59.480
You shouldn't have said that.

27:59.520 --> 28:01.320
You know in Die Hard 2 ,

28:01.360 --> 28:04.360
when the enormous soldier
is sucked into the engine?

28:04.400 --> 28:06.120
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that's like that.

28:06.160 --> 28:07.480
It will be like that,
won't it?

28:08.720 --> 28:10.560
JEREMY: Ready?

28:13.440 --> 28:14.520
We are going in.

28:18.120 --> 28:19.560
Oh, I feel buoyancy.

28:21.360 --> 28:23.320
I am proud
of my two colleagues.

28:23.360 --> 28:26.360
This is...this is historic.

28:26.400 --> 28:28.640
JEREMY: We are now
gonna fire up the jet engine.

28:28.680 --> 28:30.760
Right. Put your thing on,
it's gonna be bloody loud.

28:30.800 --> 28:31.880
-These things.

28:31.920 --> 28:33.240
That's a good point.

28:33.280 --> 28:35.840
-Right.
-Comms check, comms check.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.960
Dials are engaged.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.120
This is the speedometer.

28:39.160 --> 28:41.080
OK, we've got ignitor on,
bilge pump off,

28:41.120 --> 28:42.200
throttle set at idle.

28:42.240 --> 28:44.480
-Go.
-Starting jet.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.240
Holy shit!

28:49.440 --> 28:51.480
It's going...
Don't look at it!

28:51.520 --> 28:53.320
JEREMY: Don't look
in the rear-view mirror.

29:04.640 --> 29:06.280
Oh, this is phenomenal!

29:07.960 --> 29:10.080
Taking up the power now.
Fifty percent.

29:10.120 --> 29:11.640
Is that 50%?

29:11.680 --> 29:14.640
Yeah, that's about 50,
but 70 is 100.

29:14.680 --> 29:16.480
What do you mean,
"70 is 100"?

29:16.520 --> 29:19.560
I couldn't find a dial that
exactly matched the revs,

29:19.600 --> 29:23.200
so 70 on here is 100% thrust.

29:24.600 --> 29:26.480
JEREMY: I'm going full power.
Here we go.

29:28.440 --> 29:30.720
Hold tight. You wanna hold
on to something, seriously.

29:30.760 --> 29:32.080
Right, go.

29:36.080 --> 29:37.840
JEREMY: That's 100% thrust.

29:56.240 --> 29:57.960
Right, well,
we're doing 2mph.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.440
JEREMY: Come on!

30:00.480 --> 30:02.640
We're doing three!

30:02.680 --> 30:04.720
Why is it so slow?

30:04.760 --> 30:07.520
I mean, that jet
is from a Russian fighter!

30:07.560 --> 30:10.480
That is capable of keeping
a Russian fighter in the air.

30:10.520 --> 30:13.120
Why won't it make us
go more than three?

30:13.160 --> 30:17.160
In the air,
that's the point - the air!

30:19.000 --> 30:21.160
Hammond is keeping up
with us.

30:22.840 --> 30:23.960
That's it?

30:24.000 --> 30:26.920
Come on!

30:26.960 --> 30:29.360
-We're sinking.

30:29.400 --> 30:31.280
No, my half is sinking.

30:31.320 --> 30:34.680
Oh, God! We really do need...
I'm gonna go in to shore.

30:37.840 --> 30:40.560
I don't think they needed
the neck braces in the end.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.960
JAMES: And throttle back.

30:53.520 --> 30:54.920
-Three.

30:54.960 --> 30:57.440
RICHARD: Three?
-Yeah, it does three.

30:57.480 --> 30:59.080
That's your top speed,
it's three?

31:00.080 --> 31:02.720
You could row at 3mph.

31:03.880 --> 31:05.880
JEREMY: On the upside,
and there is one,

31:05.920 --> 31:08.280
neither of us were killed.

31:08.320 --> 31:09.680
And that's an upside?

31:09.720 --> 31:11.800
No, the issue at hand is...

31:11.840 --> 31:13.360
RICHARD: It doesn't work.
-Yes.

31:13.400 --> 31:15.080
Why doesn't it work?

31:15.120 --> 31:18.320
Well, it's mainly to do with
the shape of the car,

31:18.360 --> 31:20.800
the shape of the sawn-up bits
of tatty old boat

31:20.840 --> 31:22.360
that you've Blu-Tacked to it.

31:22.400 --> 31:23.960
The drag of the pontoons,

31:24.000 --> 31:26.400
the size and power
and position of the engine,

31:26.440 --> 31:27.880
the amount of fuel
it will run,

31:27.920 --> 31:29.240
the basic physics.

31:29.280 --> 31:32.240
The fact that water is
750 times as dense as air...

31:34.480 --> 31:38.400
JAMES: It was time to go back
to the drawing board.

31:38.440 --> 31:42.280
And this time, we gave Jeremy
a job he could actually do.

31:45.280 --> 31:47.760
Now, this is the car that
currently holds the record

31:47.800 --> 31:49.560
for amphibious vehicles.

31:49.600 --> 31:51.520
It's the Gibbs Humdinga,

31:51.560 --> 31:54.080
and, as you can see,
it is not an ancient Suzuki

31:54.120 --> 31:56.200
with an old Russian
jet engine on the back.

31:56.240 --> 31:59.080
No, it's a light, plastic car
with a hull,

31:59.120 --> 32:02.240
and, as you can see,
retractable wheels.

32:02.280 --> 32:04.840
Exactly. And that's why
we have chosen,

32:04.880 --> 32:08.360
as the basis for our project,
this.

32:14.600 --> 32:19.480
Which is a Reliant Robin
in a 1970s leisure suit.

32:19.520 --> 32:21.600
No, it is a Bond Bug:

32:21.640 --> 32:24.480
one of the coolest cars
from the '70s.

32:24.520 --> 32:28.080
And I can see why you chose
this particular one, Hammond.

32:28.120 --> 32:30.560
It's got your name on it.

32:30.600 --> 32:33.520
Shut up. The only reason these
things never really caught on

32:33.560 --> 32:36.640
was because nobody thought
of making them amphibious.

32:36.680 --> 32:38.000
Yes, but we have, you see.

32:38.040 --> 32:41.560
So we're gonna fit it
with retractable wheels,
same as the Gibbs,

32:41.600 --> 32:43.680
and we're gonna use the
engine from one of these.

32:43.720 --> 32:46.080
JEREMY: A jet engine.
-Yes. Sort of, but different.

32:46.120 --> 32:47.200
JEREMY: It's my idea.

32:47.240 --> 32:49.000
The jet engine
was not your idea.

32:49.040 --> 32:50.720
No, the jet engine
isn't my idea,

32:50.760 --> 32:52.440
but the idea of making
an amphibious car

32:52.480 --> 32:54.400
using a jet engine
was my idea.

32:54.440 --> 32:56.880
This is a water jet,
it's different.

32:56.920 --> 32:58.600
And anyway, this is genius,

32:58.640 --> 33:00.560
because you can rent
one of these

33:00.600 --> 33:02.040
from pretty much
any beach in the world,

33:02.080 --> 33:03.960
that will do 50mph
out of the box.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
-This one will do 67.
-It will. Exactly.

33:06.040 --> 33:07.160
Well, that's plenty.

33:07.200 --> 33:08.840
So, all we've gotta do
is incorporate this

33:08.880 --> 33:11.120
into the roadworthy shell
of the Bond Bug,

33:11.160 --> 33:15.600
and we've got a very fast car
and a very fast boat
in the same thing.

33:15.640 --> 33:18.480
Which is exactly
what I was doing.

33:18.520 --> 33:20.440
JAMES: At this point,
we sent Jeremy home

33:20.480 --> 33:24.040
and set to work
on building our masterpiece.

33:36.240 --> 33:38.400
I don't know
why you're applauding.

33:38.440 --> 33:40.480
They know nothing
about boats.

33:40.520 --> 33:41.920
Absolutely nothing.

33:41.960 --> 33:44.200
Old planes? Yes.
Helicopters? Yes.

33:44.240 --> 33:47.240
Old motorcycles? A lot.
But boats? Nothing!

33:47.280 --> 33:50.640
But, we shall see what
they came up with later on.

33:50.680 --> 33:54.440
Now, though, it is time
for Celebrity Face-Off.

34:05.520 --> 34:08.000
It's a simple question
this week.

34:08.040 --> 34:10.960
Who is the world's
fastest magician?

34:11.000 --> 34:13.080
To find out, would you please
welcome Dynamo,

34:13.120 --> 34:15.800
and Penn and
his silent partner, Teller.

34:20.840 --> 34:22.320
Amazing!

34:22.360 --> 34:24.120
I'm already amazed!

34:24.160 --> 34:27.880
I've gotta be honest,
magic is my favourite thing
in the entire world.

34:27.920 --> 34:30.040
Apart from boating
in the south of France.

34:30.080 --> 34:32.640
But we must begin with cars,
obviously.

34:32.680 --> 34:34.720
This being a car show,
occasionally.

34:34.760 --> 34:37.080
You both started with 4x4s,
as far as I can work out,

34:37.120 --> 34:38.560
or they have featured
in your life.

34:38.600 --> 34:41.320
You are a G

34:41.360 --> 34:42.480
Yeah, yeah.

34:42.520 --> 34:45.040
So, at the beginning, when my
TV show got a bit of success,

34:45.080 --> 34:47.720
Mercedes came and they
would give me cars to drive.

34:47.760 --> 34:50.000
But then,
I did a commercial with Fiat,

34:50.040 --> 34:52.720
and Mercedes weren't
too happy about that.

34:54.640 --> 34:56.520
I used some of the money
from Fiat to...

34:56.560 --> 34:58.480
I still love the G-Wagen,
so I bought one.

34:58.520 --> 35:01.440
So, you used Fiat money
to buy a Mercedes?

35:01.480 --> 35:04.760
-Yeah.
-That is quite good.
But you had a Ford Bronco.

35:04.800 --> 35:08.240
But only because
I watched OJ do the...

35:08.280 --> 35:11.200
-And I said,
"He's kind of a big guy.

35:11.240 --> 35:12.480
Maybe I'd fit in that car."

35:12.520 --> 35:16.160
And I got the whole thing,
and it was all too masculine,

35:16.200 --> 35:19.440
so I painted it stripper pink
for Vegas.

35:19.480 --> 35:21.720
When you're driving to work,
do they think
you're a stripper?

35:21.760 --> 35:22.880
I hope so.

35:24.160 --> 35:26.040
Didn't you have a Ford Falcon
at some stage?

35:26.080 --> 35:28.880
Well, when I was
in high school...

35:28.920 --> 35:31.680
I'm from a rural area.

35:31.720 --> 35:34.280
..my mother gave me her car,
which was a Ford Falcon.

35:34.320 --> 35:38.360
But for me,
that was just a place
to have sex in high school.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.600
And then
you started touring together.

35:40.640 --> 35:43.640
-Mm-hm.
-So you presumably needed
some kind of tour...

35:43.680 --> 35:44.880
You know, we're carny trash.

35:44.920 --> 35:47.280
We did carnivals and outdoor
shows and all of that.

35:47.320 --> 35:49.080
We're the worst
kind of people.

35:49.120 --> 35:51.880
And we had to drive all over
the United States of America.

35:51.920 --> 35:53.360
So, we went
to an auction place

35:53.400 --> 35:56.160
and bought a Datsun 210
station wagon,

35:56.200 --> 35:59.960
with the back seat down,
and then our trunks in there
with all our stuff.

36:00.000 --> 36:03.960
We were so terrified
of having our props stolen,

36:04.000 --> 36:06.520
that we had a magnetic sign
we put on the side

36:06.560 --> 36:09.880
that said, "Atlanta Centre
for Disease Control

36:09.920 --> 36:11.840
Specimen Transfer Unit."

36:11.880 --> 36:14.720
We put that on the side, with
the big boxes in the back,

36:14.760 --> 36:16.200
and that worked really well,

36:16.240 --> 36:18.200
until the sign was stolen.

36:19.840 --> 36:21.080
I wanna talk about cars,

36:21.120 --> 36:23.240
but who would rather here
see some magic?

36:23.280 --> 36:24.880
AUDIENCE: Yes!

36:24.920 --> 36:26.440
I know
we're supposed to do cars.

36:26.480 --> 36:28.840
Would you mind awfully
if you now do some?

36:28.880 --> 36:30.880
Have you actually--
You've brought something
with you?

36:30.920 --> 36:32.240
I'm gonna try something
with you.

36:32.280 --> 36:35.040
Just hold your hands out
for me.

36:35.080 --> 36:36.400
-Both, like this.

36:36.440 --> 36:37.880
-A little bit wider.

36:37.920 --> 36:39.480
Are you left or right

36:39.520 --> 36:41.840
Right-handed. Unless
we're talking about shooting.

36:41.880 --> 36:43.640
-Close it in a fist.
That one?

36:43.680 --> 36:45.440
Yeah, then turn
this left one over.

36:46.600 --> 36:48.960
I'm gonna put a little cross
right there.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.440
Can you show that
to everyone?

36:50.480 --> 36:52.640
-Show the cross to everybody.
-I've got a cross there.

36:52.680 --> 36:53.960
Let's have a look.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.760
So, make sure it's dry.

36:55.800 --> 36:57.360
It's Sharpie,
so it shouldn't come off.

36:57.400 --> 36:58.520
Yeah, it's still there.

36:58.560 --> 36:59.760
The idea...

37:00.760 --> 37:01.840
..is to make it...

37:03.080 --> 37:04.800
..disappear from there...

37:08.320 --> 37:10.560
If it's in this hand now,
I'm going to be...

37:10.600 --> 37:12.600
sake!

37:14.560 --> 37:15.640
How is that?

37:24.360 --> 37:26.320
Go on, do another one. Who'd
like to see another one?

37:26.360 --> 37:27.640
AUDIENCE: Yes!

37:27.680 --> 37:30.320
-Have you got
a piece of paper there?

37:30.360 --> 37:32.000
Er, yes.

37:32.040 --> 37:33.720
I've got a pen here.

37:33.760 --> 37:37.200
I'm just gonna just do
some markings for you.

37:37.240 --> 37:38.320
We'll start here.

37:38.360 --> 37:39.480
Take the pen.

37:39.520 --> 37:40.920
-Take the pen.
-Yeah.

37:40.960 --> 37:43.880
Give me a number
from, say, one to ten.

37:43.920 --> 37:45.120
Nine.

37:45.160 --> 37:46.560
Nine. Write it down.

37:46.600 --> 37:47.840
JEREMY: Nine.
DYNAMO: Great.

37:47.880 --> 37:49.600
We'll go for, let's see,

37:49.640 --> 37:52.360
the lady right there
with the glasses.

37:52.400 --> 37:56.160
Yeah. I need another number,
from 9 to 19.

37:56.200 --> 37:57.880
Er, 11.

37:57.920 --> 37:59.240
-Eleven.
-I think it was a man.

37:59.280 --> 38:00.960
That's a bit embarrassing.

38:03.880 --> 38:05.800
We may be
in a world of trouble here.

38:11.720 --> 38:13.080
Let's move it on, quickly!

38:13.120 --> 38:14.200
Yes.

38:14.240 --> 38:15.880
-Richard!

38:15.920 --> 38:18.360
A number from 11 to 21.

38:18.400 --> 38:19.840
Nineteen.

38:19.880 --> 38:21.880
-Yes.

38:21.920 --> 38:23.560
-Nineteen, write it down.

38:23.600 --> 38:24.800
Perfect. Yes

38:24.840 --> 38:28.120
Uh, we'll go for this guy
here in the blue jacket.

38:28.160 --> 38:29.920
-Actually, that's a woman.

38:34.320 --> 38:37.520
-It's so hard to tell.

38:39.360 --> 38:41.840
A number from 19 to 29,
please.

38:41.880 --> 38:43.520
27.

38:43.560 --> 38:44.960
Twenty-seven,
write that down.

38:46.120 --> 38:47.600
Gilles Villeneuve's
old number.

38:47.640 --> 38:51.080
We'll go for this gentleman
right here
with a white t-shirt.

38:51.120 --> 38:53.760
-The gender-fluid gentleman.
-Yes. Yes!

38:53.800 --> 38:56.480
DYNAMO: A number
from 27 to 37.

38:56.520 --> 38:57.680
Thirty-three.

38:57.720 --> 38:59.000
Thirty-three,
write that down.

38:59.040 --> 39:01.480
Finally, the lady at the end
with the long hair.

39:01.520 --> 39:04.680
Can we have a number
between 33 and 49?

39:04.720 --> 39:06.840
-Forty-two.
DYNAMO: Forty-two.

39:06.880 --> 39:10.720
So, nine, 11, 19,
27, 33 and 42.

39:10.760 --> 39:13.640
These are the numbers
we randomly generated today.

39:13.680 --> 39:15.200
A couple of years ago,

39:15.240 --> 39:17.320
I picked six numbers myself.

39:17.360 --> 39:18.680
They're like
my lucky numbers,

39:18.720 --> 39:21.200
and I went to a shop and
I bought a lottery ticket.

39:21.240 --> 39:22.520
And I won.

39:22.560 --> 39:25.600
Only a tenner, but, you know,
I won something.

39:25.640 --> 39:28.080
And I actually keep
that ticket in my wallet.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.520
-There we go.
-No, no, no. No!

39:31.560 --> 39:33.920
Keep it in my wallet
for good luck.

39:33.960 --> 39:35.200
Where's the camera?

39:35.240 --> 39:36.640
Can you see that?

39:36.680 --> 39:38.920
There's one ticket there.

39:38.960 --> 39:41.680
-I think you'll find the
numbers quite interesting,

39:41.720 --> 39:43.240
if you wanna read them
out loud.

39:43.280 --> 39:45.680
So, you...

39:45.720 --> 39:47.640
I'll need my glasses
on a lottery ticket.

39:48.640 --> 39:49.800
So, let's just...

39:49.840 --> 39:51.600
-Nine.

39:51.640 --> 39:52.760
Nine, right there.

39:52.800 --> 39:53.920
-Eleven.
-Eleven.

39:53.960 --> 39:55.560
-Nineteen.
-Nineteen for Richard.

39:55.600 --> 39:57.360
JEREMY: Twenty-seven.
DYNAMO: Twenty-seven.

39:57.400 --> 39:59.160
JEREMY: Thirty-three.
DYNAMO: Thirty-three.

39:59.200 --> 40:00.800
DYNAMO: The last one?
JEREMY: Forty-two.

40:10.200 --> 40:13.080
That's actually a lottery
ticket. It is a lott...

40:13.120 --> 40:15.320
I'm...
Well, I'm staggered.

40:15.360 --> 40:17.600
But anyway, look,
we haven't finished yet.

40:17.640 --> 40:20.120
Shall we see
what the Americans can do?

40:20.160 --> 40:22.920
AUDIENCE: Yes!
-Come on, you two, let's have
a look. What have you got?

40:22.960 --> 40:25.640
Well, you know,
I was asking Dynamo,

40:25.680 --> 40:27.360
you're a member
of the Magic Circle, right?

40:27.400 --> 40:28.600
-Yeah.
PENN: We are not.

40:28.640 --> 40:30.280
Teller and I
have a reputation,

40:30.320 --> 40:33.560
not ill-deserved, for
giving away magic secrets.

40:33.600 --> 40:35.200
You do. You always say
how your tricks work.

40:35.240 --> 40:37.520
We have done that, so they
will not let us be members.

40:37.560 --> 40:38.680
So that got us thinking.

40:38.720 --> 40:42.280
Could we do a trick that
would fool the Magic Circle,

40:42.320 --> 40:43.920
while giving away...

40:45.120 --> 40:46.920
..all the very principles
we've given away?

40:46.960 --> 40:49.840
And the first thing we gave
away, in 1985, way back then,

40:49.880 --> 40:51.600
we're on
the David Letterman programme,

40:51.640 --> 40:54.440
and gave away the idea
of fake blindfolds

40:54.480 --> 40:55.920
that are used by magicians.

40:55.960 --> 41:00.480
We said, "Every blindfold
used by a magician is fake,"
which we've stood by.

41:00.520 --> 41:03.880
We're gonna have a blindfold
that can't be faked,
which is-- Dynamo.

41:03.920 --> 41:05.160
Teller's gonna stand up here,

41:05.200 --> 41:08.280
and, Dynamo, just make sure
that Teller can't see.

41:08.320 --> 41:11.480
Come over there and
just make sure that Teller...

41:11.520 --> 41:14.560
-Not permanently,
but just for now.

41:14.600 --> 41:17.840
Just put your hands
right over his eyes there
so he can't see.

41:17.880 --> 41:19.480
No need to be gentle,
it's not me.

41:19.520 --> 41:22.280
-Cool, cool.
-All you've gotta do
is make sure he can't see.

41:22.320 --> 41:23.640
How many fingers
am I holding up?

41:25.520 --> 41:27.080
Now, we've been accused

41:27.120 --> 41:29.880
of giving away the idea
of marked cards.

41:29.920 --> 41:31.480
Marked cards
are very hard to...

41:31.520 --> 41:33.160
Even professional gamblers

41:33.200 --> 41:34.600
sometimes can't determine
if they're marked.

41:34.640 --> 41:36.360
But Dynamo's gonna
make sure they're not marked.

41:36.400 --> 41:39.000
The cards
will be dealt face-down
in Teller's right hand.

41:39.040 --> 41:41.040
If the cards were marked,
which they're not,

41:41.080 --> 41:42.160
Teller would have to see,

41:42.200 --> 41:43.920
and Dynamo's
making sure he can't see.

41:43.960 --> 41:45.760
-He can't see.
-The other thing we gave away

41:45.800 --> 41:48.000
was on the Johnny Carson
programme.

41:48.040 --> 41:50.520
We gave away
the idea of a card force:

41:50.560 --> 41:52.360
that it's easy to do a trick

41:52.400 --> 41:54.400
if you know in advance
what card's gonna be picked.

41:54.440 --> 41:57.360
And one of the ways you can
do a force like that, Jeremy,

41:57.400 --> 42:00.680
is to have all the cards
be the same.

42:00.720 --> 42:02.040
-JEREMY: Yeah.
-Then just have a card selected,

42:02.080 --> 42:03.800
where you know what's
it's gonna be.

42:03.840 --> 42:06.200
-Stand up for a second,
Jeremy.
-Yeah, I can become vertical.

42:06.240 --> 42:08.280
I want you to make sure
you look over these,

42:08.320 --> 42:11.200
and make sure
they are not all the same.

42:11.240 --> 42:13.360
-I'll try to fan them all out.
-No, that's a pack of cards.

42:13.400 --> 42:14.520
Yeah, it's a pack of cards.

42:14.560 --> 42:17.360
Now, another way
you can do a card force

42:17.400 --> 42:18.800
is you can use
sleight of hand

42:18.840 --> 42:20.680
to force the bottom card
or the top card,

42:20.720 --> 42:22.080
or even a card in the middle.

42:22.120 --> 42:25.120
I'm gonna eliminate sleight
of hand by using your hands.

42:25.160 --> 42:26.240
OK?

42:26.280 --> 42:29.280
So, I'm gonna give you
most of the deck right there.

42:29.320 --> 42:30.480
And I'm gonna...

42:30.520 --> 42:32.160
Just fan them out like this.
Fan them out.

42:32.200 --> 42:34.360
Don't let me see,
but just think of one.

42:34.400 --> 42:36.560
Don't even point to it,
don't cut to it.

42:36.600 --> 42:38.640
Just look over all the cards.
You have most of the deck.

42:38.680 --> 42:40.560
And then just think
of one card.

42:40.600 --> 42:41.880
Don't look at it,
just think of it.

42:41.920 --> 42:43.720
Then close them up so I can't
see what you're doing.

42:43.760 --> 42:45.640
And then give those cards
a good shuffle.

42:45.680 --> 42:47.280
Or give them
that kind of shuffle.

42:47.320 --> 42:48.560
Good. That's good.

42:48.600 --> 42:50.920
But face-down so I can't tell
what you're shuffling.

42:50.960 --> 42:52.680
-Mm-hm.

42:52.720 --> 42:56.040
-You have no idea where it
is in the deck
-No. No.

42:56.080 --> 42:59.320
Now, magicians often
want you to misremember

42:59.360 --> 43:00.680
the sequence of events.

43:00.720 --> 43:02.800
We want you to very much
remember the sequence.

43:02.840 --> 43:04.920
The card is only
in your head, is that right?

43:04.960 --> 43:06.320
-Yeah.

43:06.360 --> 43:09.200
-Nowhere else.
-The cards are all mixed up,
you have no idea where it is.

43:09.240 --> 43:10.920
Now, I'm gonna put these
in your hand.

43:10.960 --> 43:13.200
Now, the order of these will
not change. It will not change.

43:13.240 --> 43:14.400
I'm not gonna
touch them again.

43:14.440 --> 43:15.680
I will no touch them again,
OK?

43:15.720 --> 43:18.120
Now that my hands are off,
and I won't touch them again,

43:18.160 --> 43:19.320
what was the name
of the card?

43:19.360 --> 43:20.440
-King of Hearts.
-OK.

43:20.480 --> 43:23.520
Now, you're gonna go over
there and you're gonna deal
the cards, one at a time,

43:23.560 --> 43:26.000
from the top, face-down,
to Teller's right hand, OK?

43:26.040 --> 43:27.760
-Into his right hand.

43:27.800 --> 43:29.120
JEREMY: Face
PENN: Yeah.

43:29.160 --> 43:30.600
PENN: Dynamo, make sure
he can't see.

43:30.640 --> 43:31.760
He can't see nothing.

43:34.600 --> 43:36.880
See, we are just being
whipping boys again, Dynamo,

43:36.920 --> 43:38.720
us English.

43:48.080 --> 43:50.800
-OK, Dynamo, was he able
to see, even for a moment?
-Nothing.

43:50.840 --> 43:52.960
-Jeremy, what was the name
of your card?
-King of Hearts.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.240
Look at the next card.

43:55.280 --> 43:58.600
-Oh, for Christ's sake.
-Thought of card
out of a shuffled deck.

44:03.400 --> 44:04.600
JEREMY: Well...

44:10.320 --> 44:12.200
You came here, of course,
to do your laps.

44:12.240 --> 44:15.560
And, as we can see,
in the rapidly fading light,

44:15.600 --> 44:17.280
the weather
has not been clement.

44:17.320 --> 44:19.640
In fact, when we arrived
at the track this morning,

44:19.680 --> 44:21.000
it looked like this.

44:21.040 --> 44:23.000
And then...
You can see the problem.

44:23.040 --> 44:25.280
That bit, you can sort of see
where the track goes.

44:25.320 --> 44:27.440
But if we've got
another shot-- I think
we've got a moving shot.

44:27.480 --> 44:30.160
Now, somewhere in there
is a racetrack.

44:31.400 --> 44:33.560
Which makes it quite tricky,
I should imagine,

44:33.600 --> 44:34.680
to see where you were going.

44:34.720 --> 44:35.960
-Yeah.

44:36.000 --> 44:39.760
And there was a particularly
fine moment, I have to say,
on the...

44:39.800 --> 44:42.720
It's supposed to be
a flat-out corner
when it's dry,

44:42.760 --> 44:44.240
but it really wasn't.

44:44.280 --> 44:46.200
The weather was improving,
it was thawing.

44:47.280 --> 44:49.000
And it all went, really,
brilliantly wrong.

44:49.040 --> 44:52.520
Who'd like to see Dynamo
going round in a few circles?

44:52.560 --> 44:54.120
AUDIENCE: Yes!

44:54.160 --> 44:55.320
Let's have a look at this.

44:55.360 --> 44:56.680
This is a flat-out corner,

44:56.720 --> 44:58.720
and then
you just can see it's going,

44:58.760 --> 44:59.920
and then...

44:59.960 --> 45:03.040
That's a properly big
slide-off, that one is.

45:03.080 --> 45:05.400
Round of applause for that,
though.

45:05.440 --> 45:06.960
We like that.

45:08.240 --> 45:10.960
-No, it was well fun!

45:11.000 --> 45:12.840
I was like, "I could have
done this all day,

45:12.880 --> 45:14.000
it's so much fun."

45:14.040 --> 45:16.480
Who'd like to see the lap
that eventually resulted?

45:16.520 --> 45:18.520
AUDIENCE: Yes!
-Let's have a look.

45:18.560 --> 45:20.000
Dynamo's lap, here it comes.

45:20.040 --> 45:21.520
Thawed out.

45:21.560 --> 45:24.320
A nice, smooth, quiet start.
And he's away.

45:24.360 --> 45:26.280
Right, let's do this!

45:26.320 --> 45:27.680
JEREMY: OK, that's...

45:27.720 --> 45:29.080
Ooh, that's quick through...

45:29.120 --> 45:32.160
Oh! Yes, that's cutting
that corner, but nicely done.

45:32.200 --> 45:33.560
Nicely held.

45:33.600 --> 45:38.280
And now we go on to what
is normally gravel, but...

45:38.320 --> 45:41.040
What does it look like now?
It's just mud and slush.

45:41.080 --> 45:42.320
God, that looks tricky!

45:42.360 --> 45:43.640
But you're keeping it...

45:43.680 --> 45:46.440
Ooh, a bit wide through
there, but not bad at all.

45:48.640 --> 45:49.720
Again, not bad.

45:49.760 --> 45:52.480
Not fast, but...

45:52.520 --> 45:54.800
I don't think I'm on
the track any more, guys.

45:55.840 --> 45:57.200
JEREMY:
No, it's still brown...

45:57.240 --> 46:00.680
No, that is a James May
cornering speed through
that one.

46:00.720 --> 46:02.480
Is the car putting
traction down all right?

46:02.520 --> 46:05.560
DYNAMO: No,
it was all over the place!

46:05.600 --> 46:06.920
JEREMY: No, that's nice.

46:06.960 --> 46:08.920
Yeah, splashing through
the last bit.

46:08.960 --> 46:10.440
Difficult Bit 2
as we call it.

46:10.480 --> 46:11.760
It's driving on water,
this is.

46:11.800 --> 46:14.080
JEREMY: It is, yeah.
It's almost Jesus-esque.

46:14.120 --> 46:16.800
And then now we get
back onto the tarmac.

46:16.840 --> 46:19.480
Ooh, I say, that was tonnes
of front-end grip there

46:19.520 --> 46:21.160
all of a sudden.

46:21.200 --> 46:22.760
And look at the way
the front's turning in.

46:22.800 --> 46:24.080
That's unbelievable!

46:24.120 --> 46:27.600
Now, we go onto the
really fast bit, ordinarily.

46:27.640 --> 46:30.040
Come on, then. Here we go.

46:30.080 --> 46:33.200
JEREMY: This is where
you lost it in the practice.

46:33.240 --> 46:34.680
But you haven't lost it
this time.

46:34.720 --> 46:37.480
That front is suddenly
sticking really well!

46:37.520 --> 46:39.760
Coming up to the last corner.

46:39.800 --> 46:43.120
And a little bit of
understeer through there,
but nicely tamed.

46:43.160 --> 46:45.360
And there we are,
across the line, everybody!

46:48.040 --> 46:50.520
Nicely done. Not easy.

46:50.560 --> 46:53.360
Not easy.

46:53.400 --> 46:57.240
Now then, after you'd had
a go, it was your turn.

46:57.280 --> 46:59.000
-Yes.

46:59.040 --> 47:02.160
I had a very good time, yeah.
And I had Teller as a
passenger, which was helpful.

47:02.200 --> 47:04.720
Oh, that would help!
Balance it out nicely.

47:04.760 --> 47:06.080
PENN: Sure.

47:06.120 --> 47:07.680
You also had a moment,
shall we say.

47:07.720 --> 47:09.360
I did. I did, yeah.

47:09.400 --> 47:10.840
Would anybody like to see
this moment?

47:10.880 --> 47:12.640
AUDIENCE: Yes!
-Let's have a look.

47:12.680 --> 47:14.600
This is quick
coming into the last corner.

47:14.640 --> 47:15.800
That's understeer.

47:15.840 --> 47:17.640
Oh, somebody's been off there
already,

47:17.680 --> 47:20.320
you can see the tyre marks,
but not as far you went.

47:20.360 --> 47:21.680
That is impressive.

47:21.720 --> 47:25.040
That's the furthest anybody's
been off that track,

47:25.080 --> 47:26.480
by a long way.

47:26.520 --> 47:29.360
You're definitely
winning that, so far.
Definitely.

47:29.400 --> 47:31.720
Furthest off the track,
I got that.

47:31.760 --> 47:34.200
-But then you got a lap
together, both of you.
-I did.

47:34.240 --> 47:36.360
Let's have a look
at this lap.

47:36.400 --> 47:39.600
Yeah, another nice,
tidy start.

47:39.640 --> 47:41.400
Roaring off
down to the first corner.

47:41.440 --> 47:43.920
So, we're going, Teller.
Can you feel that?

47:45.240 --> 47:46.960
JEREMY: It's not at all
scary in there.

47:48.080 --> 47:49.720
Right, that's tidily done
through there,

47:49.760 --> 47:51.120
keeping it really
on the island,

47:51.160 --> 47:53.360
unlike Dynamo,
who was a bit mad.

47:53.400 --> 47:55.000
And onto the gravel.

47:55.040 --> 47:56.400
Well, the mud.
Well, the slush.

47:56.440 --> 47:57.760
Whatever you wanna call it.

47:59.240 --> 48:00.560
Ahhh!

48:01.840 --> 48:03.160
PENN:
I'm going quickly there.

48:03.200 --> 48:04.520
JEREMY: Oh-hoo-hoo!

48:04.560 --> 48:06.640
-That was well held there.
PENN: Thank you.

48:06.680 --> 48:08.280
JEREMY: That's nice driving.

48:08.320 --> 48:11.200
I'm under control.
Shut up, Teller! I got it!

48:12.360 --> 48:13.680
JEREMY:
Is he putting you off?

48:13.720 --> 48:14.800
Now, this is...

48:14.840 --> 48:17.160
Sometimes, when it appears
to be slow, it's fast,

48:17.200 --> 48:20.560
and sometimes, when
it looks fast, it's slow.

48:20.600 --> 48:23.280
This is looking fast,
I'm gonna be honest,

48:23.320 --> 48:24.840
but there's a lot
of sideways action,

48:24.880 --> 48:27.280
which, of course,
isn't forward motion,

48:27.320 --> 48:30.080
-which is a problem.
-But it looks really good.

48:30.120 --> 48:32.480
JEREMY: It looks tremendous.
This is great television.

48:36.360 --> 48:38.480
And you can hear the bark
of the two-litre there

48:38.520 --> 48:39.720
as you hit the straight.

48:39.760 --> 48:41.120
-We're going!
-Ahh!

48:41.160 --> 48:43.280
-Now! Boom!
-Oh!

48:43.320 --> 48:45.480
JEREMY:
And coming up to the...

48:45.520 --> 48:47.880
This is the corner -
not this one,
but the next one,

48:47.920 --> 48:49.920
that caught you out
practising.

48:49.960 --> 48:52.160
Ooh, you're trying to get
a Scandi flick going there,

48:52.200 --> 48:53.520
but a bit too soon.

48:53.560 --> 48:54.640
Understeer again,

48:54.680 --> 48:56.240
but you've held it this time.

48:56.280 --> 48:58.320
And there we are, yeah,
across the line, everybody!

49:09.000 --> 49:10.680
Right, I have the times here.

49:10.720 --> 49:11.800
OK.

49:13.480 --> 49:15.560
We'll start with you, Dynamo.

49:15.600 --> 49:18.560
One thirty-nine point three.

49:18.600 --> 49:21.000
-That's all right
-That's really slow.

49:25.080 --> 49:27.480
But you've got
the snow symbol.

49:27.520 --> 49:30.640
So far, you're
the fastest person ever

49:30.680 --> 49:33.680
to go round our track
in the snow.

49:33.720 --> 49:36.600
But are you faster
than Penn and Teller?

49:36.640 --> 49:38.880
There's actually
excitement here, isn't there?

49:38.920 --> 49:40.600
DYNAMO: Yeah.
PENN: There's nervousness.

49:40.640 --> 49:42.120
You did it in one...

49:43.520 --> 49:44.640
..thirty...

49:46.880 --> 49:48.360
..three point eight.

49:52.640 --> 49:53.880
DYNAMO: Bad boy.

49:53.920 --> 49:58.240
Commiserations.
Commiserations.

49:58.280 --> 50:00.360
Congratulations, gentlemen.
Congratulations.

50:00.400 --> 50:02.800
That was fantastic!

50:02.840 --> 50:04.440
And thank you so much,
all of you,

50:04.480 --> 50:06.440
for coming along
and doing all this magic.

50:06.480 --> 50:08.520
But we must now say goodbye
to Dynamo

50:08.560 --> 50:12.080
and the world's fastest
magicians, Penn and Teller!

50:12.120 --> 50:14.800
-World's fastest magicians!

50:20.000 --> 50:23.800
Now, tonight,
we are attempting to break

50:23.840 --> 50:27.160
the British water speed
record for amphibious cars.

50:27.200 --> 50:29.760
Now, earlier on, Jeremy
had a go at making something,

50:29.800 --> 50:32.400
and his effort
was, frankly, terrible.

50:32.440 --> 50:33.720
JEREMY: No, it wasn't.
-It was.

50:33.760 --> 50:36.400
Yeah, so, Hammond and I
took control of the project,

50:36.440 --> 50:40.040
and what we decided to do
was take a 1970s
three-wheeler

50:40.080 --> 50:42.080
with a removable roof,
called a Bond Bug...

50:42.120 --> 50:43.200
Here's a picture of it.

50:43.240 --> 50:45.600
..and mate that
with a jet ski,

50:45.640 --> 50:49.200
to create something that we
had christened the Pond Bug.

50:49.240 --> 50:51.080
And then,
when it was finished,

50:51.120 --> 50:52.560
take it to the Lake District,

50:52.600 --> 50:56.680
and something called
Coniston Speed Week.

50:58.240 --> 51:00.880
JAMES: Over the decades,
many fearless daredevils

51:00.920 --> 51:04.240
have powered across this
five-mile stretch of water,

51:04.280 --> 51:06.920
in the pursuit
of new records.

51:12.080 --> 51:15.240
One was the legendary
Donald Campbell.

51:16.320 --> 51:18.720
Who was killed here in 1967,

51:18.760 --> 51:22.800
whilst trying to break
the 300mph barrier.

51:30.880 --> 51:34.560
Today, in Speed Week, that
spirit of adventure lives on,

51:34.600 --> 51:36.520
as people
from all over the world

51:36.560 --> 51:39.080
come to push their boats,
their engines,

51:39.120 --> 51:42.080
and themselves
to the absolute limit.

51:43.400 --> 51:45.240
This was speed heaven,

51:45.280 --> 51:48.880
and I felt sure
our fully road legal Pond Bug

51:48.920 --> 51:51.040
would blend in perfectly.

52:13.480 --> 52:14.560
Morning!

52:20.960 --> 52:22.560
Look at all this!

52:25.680 --> 52:29.760
Having parked up, I went off
to find Hammond and Clarkson,

52:29.800 --> 52:33.000
who reckoned he'd come up
with something better.

52:37.240 --> 52:38.560
JEREMY: Are you ready?

52:38.600 --> 52:40.600
You're gonna not
believe this.

52:40.640 --> 52:41.800
RICHARD: OK.

52:41.840 --> 52:44.520
JEREMY: Behold my genius!

52:46.040 --> 52:47.160
JAMES: Oh, hello!

52:50.200 --> 52:51.280
JEREMY: Oh, yeah!

52:51.320 --> 52:54.920
RICHARD: That is actually
quite surprising.

52:54.960 --> 52:57.760
JEREMY: So, the tracks drop
down when you're near land.

52:57.800 --> 52:59.960
JAMES: Oh, very clever!

53:01.320 --> 53:02.560
I mean, I'm sorry...

53:02.600 --> 53:04.240
I'm gonna stand back
a little bit.

53:04.280 --> 53:08.280
..have I, or have I not
created something brilliant?

53:08.320 --> 53:10.280
JAMES: No.
RICHARD: You didn't build it.

53:10.320 --> 53:12.120
And it's very cool,
but you can't use it.

53:12.160 --> 53:14.200
-Because it's not road legal!

53:14.240 --> 53:15.520
Well,
put a number plate on it.

53:15.560 --> 53:17.800
It's not an amphibious car,
it's a boat.

53:17.840 --> 53:19.480
That's a boat
with legs on it.

53:19.520 --> 53:21.760
It's not eligible
for what we're doing.

53:21.800 --> 53:24.000
BOTH: Ah!

53:30.960 --> 53:32.280
-Oh, yeah!

53:33.480 --> 53:34.880
Look at it!

53:34.920 --> 53:37.040
That is a quality job.

53:37.080 --> 53:38.840
Why are you pulling
that face?

53:38.880 --> 53:41.040
It's the stupidest thing
I've ever seen in my life.

53:41.080 --> 53:43.200
It's the coolest thing
that has ever been!

53:43.240 --> 53:45.240
-Look at it!

53:45.280 --> 53:47.400
-RICHARD: These are the doors.
-JAMES: Yes, undercarriage
doors.

53:47.440 --> 53:48.520
What doors?

53:48.560 --> 53:49.800
RICHARD: You retract
the undercarriage.

53:49.840 --> 53:51.840
The front wheel goes up,
then these doors shut,

53:51.880 --> 53:54.000
you've got a smooth hull.

53:54.040 --> 53:55.760
So those...
What do the back wheels do?

53:57.520 --> 53:58.680
What about the chine?

53:58.720 --> 54:00.480
What do you mean,
"What about the chine"?

54:00.520 --> 54:02.000
Look at the chine
at the back.

54:02.040 --> 54:04.800
This is to attempt
a water speed record.

54:04.840 --> 54:08.560
RICARD: I know!
JEREMY: This is what you need
for a high-speed run,

54:08.600 --> 54:10.800
a smooth, rounded chine.

54:10.840 --> 54:14.120
When this is up here,
it's sharp.

54:14.160 --> 54:16.760
So, as you're going along,
you catch that,

54:16.800 --> 54:18.480
and it's gonna go.

54:18.520 --> 54:21.640
JAMES: We had to make it fit
round the wheel, otherwise it
wouldn't work on the road.

54:21.680 --> 54:22.920
You could have made it round!

54:22.960 --> 54:25.880
That was a difficult
fabrication job. It was much
easier to do it like that.

54:25.920 --> 54:28.000
I'm sure it's easier, but
you've created a death trap!

54:29.600 --> 54:31.640
Weight. Keep the nose down.

54:31.680 --> 54:33.640
-JEREMY: I know what it's for.
-RICHARD: Well, there you go
then.

54:33.680 --> 54:36.360
Isn't this thing
just gonna porpoise?

54:36.400 --> 54:38.400
-We don't know.
-No. Probably.

54:38.440 --> 54:39.920
JEREMY:
Anyone who gets in that

54:39.960 --> 54:42.440
-is effectively
committing suicide.
JAMES: No, they're not!

54:42.480 --> 54:46.160
Anyone who gets in that
is gonna look the coolest
person here, that's fact one.

54:46.200 --> 54:48.440
Which one of
you two's driving it?

54:48.480 --> 54:49.800
Now, that's interesting,
because...

54:49.840 --> 54:52.040
We've had a think about that.
It's gotta be somebody

54:52.080 --> 54:53.840
with a speedboat,
powerboat racing licence.

54:53.880 --> 54:55.880
-JAMES: Yes. Have you
got one of those?
-I haven't got one.

54:55.920 --> 54:59.640
I haven't got one.
Do I know anybody
who does have one?

54:59.680 --> 55:00.960
Yes, I do have
a racing licence.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.440
-Well, there you go, then.
-And here is your racing boat.

55:03.480 --> 55:06.360
Look what
we've built for you.

55:06.400 --> 55:09.040
-I am not getting in that.
-Yes, you are.

55:09.080 --> 55:10.440
No, I'm not doing...

55:10.480 --> 55:12.640
-No!
JAMES: Well, you have to.

55:12.680 --> 55:15.800
-You have to.
-I am not.

55:15.840 --> 55:18.160
And with that,
back to the tent.

55:20.800 --> 55:22.920
-This is broken.
-No, line it up with the...

55:22.960 --> 55:24.520
It is broken,
otherwise it would...

55:24.560 --> 55:27.040
You've used a removable
steering wheel before.

55:27.080 --> 55:28.360
JAMES: Line up the...
There you go!

55:28.400 --> 55:30.600
I've mended it.

55:30.640 --> 55:32.760
JEREMY: Knowing
that 85% of people

55:32.800 --> 55:35.120
who attempt speed records
are killed,

55:35.160 --> 55:37.720
and that the boat had been
designed by imbeciles,

55:37.760 --> 55:42.280
I was fervently hoping
that it would, at least,
be easy to operate.

55:42.320 --> 55:45.280
However...

55:45.320 --> 55:48.640
You have to drive it
into the water first.
It's still in road mode.

55:48.680 --> 55:51.360
And you do that using this.
That just teases it in.

55:51.400 --> 55:53.160
A little push, a little push,
and it goes in.

55:53.200 --> 55:56.600
Once you're in the water, you
have to retract the wheels,

55:56.640 --> 55:59.960
and then you disengage
the fan and the clutch.

56:00.000 --> 56:01.920
Then you have to close
the nose wheel doors...

56:01.960 --> 56:04.080
If you push it down once,
you're in neutral.

56:04.120 --> 56:06.600
You'll still rotate round,
cos the jet's
still running...

56:06.640 --> 56:09.560
Push it up,
you'll see the current
will flow on the ammeter.

56:09.600 --> 56:10.920
When you get
a current surge...

56:10.960 --> 56:12.160
Jet thrust trim is here,

56:12.200 --> 56:13.800
and it will appear
on your screen here...

56:13.840 --> 56:15.280
Hold that, and that goes...

56:15.320 --> 56:17.520
This one,
you pull it fully back.

56:18.920 --> 56:22.720
If you knew, and you
obviously did know all along,

56:22.760 --> 56:24.400
that I was gonna be
driving this,

56:24.440 --> 56:26.280
why have you made this thing
so complicated?

56:26.320 --> 56:29.320
-That's not complicated.
-We've simplified it.

56:29.360 --> 56:31.200
These instruments
are from the jet ski.

56:31.240 --> 56:33.000
RICHARD: Comforting.

56:33.040 --> 56:34.800
Comforting.
When you're on holiday,

56:34.840 --> 56:36.160
you've looked at those
and thought,

56:36.200 --> 56:37.440
"I'm having a lovely time."

56:37.480 --> 56:39.400
That's what
you're doing today.
The water will be colder.

56:39.440 --> 56:42.640
-Why don't you take
the checklist with you?
-Because it will blow...

56:42.680 --> 56:45.040
-It tells you the things
you've got to do.
JAMES: It's so easy!

56:45.080 --> 56:46.760
We've spent hours on that!

56:46.800 --> 56:48.560
The thing to remember
is that it's...

56:48.600 --> 56:50.320
Thirty-nine miles an hour
is really fast.

56:50.360 --> 56:52.080
JAMES: It is quite fast.
-It is really fast.

56:52.120 --> 56:54.840
But if you do 40, then
you're a world record holder.

56:54.880 --> 56:57.480
-Step out of here...
JEREMY: Not world.
It's a British record.

56:57.520 --> 57:00.600
-What other sort of record
would you want?

57:05.080 --> 57:06.520
JEREMY:
To set a speed record,

57:06.560 --> 57:09.560
you have to drive past the
start line marker buoys.

57:12.320 --> 57:14.960
You're then timed
over a kilometre,

57:15.000 --> 57:16.640
after which,
you turn round...

57:18.000 --> 57:20.320
..and do exactly
the same thing

57:20.360 --> 57:22.040
in the opposite direction.

57:23.920 --> 57:28.120
Your result
is an average speed
taken from the two runs.

57:30.800 --> 57:33.960
It all sounded
very terrifying.

57:38.880 --> 57:41.240
Please sink like a stone.
Please sink!

57:41.280 --> 57:44.160
Sink! Sink!

57:45.240 --> 57:47.160
No, it isn't. Damn it!

57:47.200 --> 57:50.000
-It looks good.
-It looks brilliant!

57:50.040 --> 57:51.720
RICHARD :
We have every faith in you.

57:51.760 --> 57:53.360
-We don't have every faith.
-No.

57:53.400 --> 57:55.600
No faith.

57:55.640 --> 57:56.760
JAMES: Wheels!

57:56.800 --> 57:58.120
Wheels coming up.

58:01.400 --> 58:04.280
JEREMY: It was now time
for the checklist.

58:04.320 --> 58:06.680
What do I do with the clutch?
I've forgotten that.

58:06.720 --> 58:09.840
Doors.
Doors. Is that right?

58:09.880 --> 58:12.400
How do I get it out...
Wait a minute. Right, bilge.

58:12.440 --> 58:13.800
No, that's bilge,
that's not right.

58:13.840 --> 58:15.080
No, it's just...

58:15.120 --> 58:16.720
Oh, this is terrible!

58:16.760 --> 58:18.800
Hammond! May! You idiots!

58:18.840 --> 58:20.720
JAMES: Why is he just
going round and round?

58:20.760 --> 58:22.560
Is there a record
for going round and round?

58:22.600 --> 58:25.840
RICHARD: Don't know, but if
there is, it's in the bag.

58:25.880 --> 58:28.360
Right. I think we need
to go to a better viewing
position to see his run.

58:28.400 --> 58:30.200
Let's go over there.

58:30.240 --> 58:32.520
JEREMY: With the ridiculous
checklist completed,

58:32.560 --> 58:34.240
I had to get some speed up,

58:34.280 --> 58:37.240
so I could cross
the start line at full chat.

58:39.640 --> 58:41.320
Visor down.

58:44.800 --> 58:46.880
It's on the plain now.
We're on the plain.

58:48.280 --> 58:49.760
It's very spray-y.

58:49.800 --> 58:53.640
It's a badly-designed hull.

58:53.680 --> 58:56.320
JEREMY: But the hull
was the least of my problems.

58:56.360 --> 58:58.320
Jesus Christ! This steering!

59:02.760 --> 59:04.440
Oh...

59:04.480 --> 59:05.880
It's a  nightmare!

59:07.000 --> 59:08.160
I can't steer it!

59:08.200 --> 59:10.160
I literally cannot steer it!

59:11.280 --> 59:13.080
I think
he's experimenting with it.

59:13.120 --> 59:15.200
I think he's sort of testing.

59:15.240 --> 59:16.520
Oh, my God!

59:20.440 --> 59:22.560
JAMES: It looks pretty good.
RICHARD: It looks fabulous!

59:22.600 --> 59:24.040
I bet it handles
like a dream!

59:24.080 --> 59:25.480
Oh, come on!

59:25.520 --> 59:27.280
I'm gonna crash
into the bloody safety boat!

59:30.080 --> 59:33.760
-Look, he's making turns. Yes!
-That looks tremendous!

59:33.800 --> 59:36.400
JEREMY: Three times
I tried to get the Pond Bug

59:36.440 --> 59:38.400
pointing in the
right direction.

59:40.200 --> 59:42.520
Absolutely impossible!

59:42.560 --> 59:46.160
And then I thought, "Sod it,"
put my foot down,

59:46.200 --> 59:47.920
and went for it.

59:51.400 --> 59:53.160
Oh, Christ!

59:53.200 --> 59:57.560
It's only my skill
that is keeping this pointing
in a straight line.

1:00:00.840 --> 1:00:03.320
And, to make matters worse
for a man on a speed run,

1:00:03.360 --> 1:00:07.160
I had no idea
how fast I was going.

1:00:07.200 --> 1:00:10.720
I've got a GPS speedo,
but I can't read it,

1:00:10.760 --> 1:00:13.120
because there isn't any GPS.

1:00:16.400 --> 1:00:19.480
Why have they given me
such shoddy workmanship?

1:00:21.240 --> 1:00:22.360
Oh, heavens!

1:00:26.480 --> 1:00:27.560
Oh, Christ!

1:00:27.600 --> 1:00:30.520
That's the worst thing
I've ever done, ever.

1:00:30.560 --> 1:00:33.640
And now, I've gotta
turn round and do it again.

1:00:33.680 --> 1:00:36.160
I've gotta wait
for my own wash to die down.

1:00:36.200 --> 1:00:39.080
That's what did for Campbell.
He went back too quickly.

1:00:43.280 --> 1:00:44.480
Here we go.

1:00:49.480 --> 1:00:51.480
That is my foot
pinned to the floor!

1:00:54.680 --> 1:00:57.960
Jesus!
It's starting to chain lock!

1:00:59.600 --> 1:01:01.560
It's really bad.

1:01:03.680 --> 1:01:04.760
Ahhh!

1:01:05.920 --> 1:01:07.520
And then...

1:01:07.560 --> 1:01:08.800
Oh, my God!

1:01:08.840 --> 1:01:10.760
Oh, no,
we've got a power problem!

1:01:10.800 --> 1:01:12.440
I'm losing power!

1:01:14.320 --> 1:01:17.440
May and Hammond have built
a piece of shit here.

1:01:19.120 --> 1:01:22.280
It sounds
a little bit inconsistent.

1:01:22.320 --> 1:01:24.400
That's maybe him
feathering the throttle.

1:01:24.440 --> 1:01:27.160
He is possibly finessing it
to keep it on the plain.

1:01:28.920 --> 1:01:30.520
Oh, no! Come on!

1:01:38.920 --> 1:01:41.120
Jesus! A lot of smoke.

1:01:42.240 --> 1:01:43.800
Well, that was a disaster!

1:01:43.840 --> 1:01:47.120
I've got no GPS, so I don't
know how fast that was.

1:01:47.160 --> 1:01:50.120
And the engine
is cutting out all the time.

1:01:51.600 --> 1:01:54.360
Basically, it was time
for a stern word

1:01:54.400 --> 1:01:56.440
with the
engineering department.

1:01:57.720 --> 1:01:59.280
-Right, you two...
RICHARD: Yeah?

1:01:59.320 --> 1:02:00.560
Not only have you
built something

1:02:00.600 --> 1:02:02.120
-ugly and complicated...
-It's not...

1:02:02.160 --> 1:02:04.040
JEREMY: No,
it's rubbish and lethal.

1:02:04.080 --> 1:02:06.600
JEREMY: The worst thing
is the steering.

1:02:06.640 --> 1:02:08.880
You cannot get it going
in a straight line.

1:02:08.920 --> 1:02:10.400
The steering
is a horrible compromise,

1:02:10.440 --> 1:02:13.600
cos it's gotta work
the steering wheel
and steer the boat.

1:02:13.640 --> 1:02:15.440
"Horrible compromise"
is a way of describing it.

1:02:15.480 --> 1:02:17.400
"Lethal" is another way.

1:02:18.480 --> 1:02:20.040
-It looked great!
-Looked great out there.

1:02:20.080 --> 1:02:21.240
JAMES: Yeah.

1:02:21.280 --> 1:02:25.040
-I was doing about 4mph.
-RICHARD: Well, that's a start.

1:02:25.080 --> 1:02:27.120
JEREMY: Then, an official
came on the Tannoy

1:02:27.160 --> 1:02:29.080
to announce my result.

1:02:46.600 --> 1:02:48.720
-There you go!

1:02:48.760 --> 1:02:50.200
We did it!

1:02:50.240 --> 1:02:51.480
What do you mean "we" did it?

1:02:51.520 --> 1:02:52.760
Would you have swam it?

1:02:52.800 --> 1:02:54.880
-I did it!
-We did it!

1:02:57.160 --> 1:02:58.320
Thank you so much.

1:02:59.800 --> 1:03:00.920
Thank you, thank you.

1:03:03.360 --> 1:03:07.200
Thank you! Thank you all
for applauding me!

1:03:07.240 --> 1:03:09.840
No, wait, they're applauding
us as a team.

1:03:09.880 --> 1:03:12.080
Listen! I'm sorry
to go on about this,

1:03:12.120 --> 1:03:14.320
but Roger Bannister
was the first

1:03:14.360 --> 1:03:15.720
to break
the four-minute mile.

1:03:15.760 --> 1:03:17.440
Not the man
who made his shoes.

1:03:17.480 --> 1:03:20.600
Edmund Hillary was the first
to go up Everest.

1:03:20.640 --> 1:03:22.240
Not the man
who made his rucksack.

1:03:22.280 --> 1:03:23.560
-So, I was the first...

1:03:23.600 --> 1:03:24.960
I was the first to do that!

1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:27.280
I broke the record,
not you two!

1:03:27.320 --> 1:03:30.160
Yeah, the truth is,
to be honest, we failed.

1:03:30.200 --> 1:03:31.640
You didn't fail.

1:03:31.680 --> 1:03:33.240
I mean, if you'd spent less
time getting your hair cut

1:03:33.280 --> 1:03:36.960
and more time
working on the engine
so that it ran properly,

1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:40.360
I reckon that thing
would probably do 60 or 70.

1:03:40.400 --> 1:03:42.160
On flat water,
it definitely would.

1:03:42.200 --> 1:03:45.120
Yeah, but the thing is,
we gave it the square chines,

1:03:45.160 --> 1:03:47.640
that really terrible
steering,

1:03:47.680 --> 1:03:50.840
the fantastically complicated
knobs and buttons and things.

1:03:50.880 --> 1:03:55.120
Basically, we built a death
trap, and it didn't work.

1:03:56.640 --> 1:03:58.880
Well, so you're...
Let me get this straight.

1:03:58.920 --> 1:04:01.920
You were hoping I would
become one of the 85%

1:04:01.960 --> 1:04:03.640
who died
trying to break a record?

1:04:03.680 --> 1:04:06.200
BOTH: Yes.

1:04:06.240 --> 1:04:08.480
So we're now actively trying
to kill each other?

1:04:08.520 --> 1:04:10.840
Yes, and we can't even
do that properly!

1:04:10.880 --> 1:04:13.720
And on that
terrible disappointment,
it's time to end.

1:04:13.760 --> 1:04:14.960
Thank you so much
for watching.

1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:16.520
-Goodbye!
-Bye-bye.
