WEBVTT

00:01.784 --> 00:04.091
Previously onCharmed...I hope I don't regret this.

00:04.134 --> 00:06.397
Regret what?

00:06.441 --> 00:09.313
CYD:
Knansie uses demon blood
to raise the dead.

00:11.185 --> 00:13.361
Every person turns into a demon.

00:13.404 --> 00:15.841
MACY:
I have demon blood in me.

00:15.885 --> 00:17.539
Does that mean
I'm going to turn?

00:17.582 --> 00:20.281
HARRY:
It's a powerful
history rewriting spell.

00:20.324 --> 00:22.413
MEL:
To make it as if
Niko and I never met.

00:22.457 --> 00:24.981
JADA:
Your detective ex called

00:25.025 --> 00:26.156
to tell me my parents

00:26.200 --> 00:28.071
want to meet up.

00:34.730 --> 00:36.819
Damn!

00:36.862 --> 00:39.039
So, not to kill the mood
or anything, but why

00:39.082 --> 00:40.518
is your ex-girlfriend
working with witch hunters?

00:40.562 --> 00:42.520
With what?!
That arrow's

00:42.564 --> 00:44.174
been protected
against spells.

00:44.218 --> 00:46.698
It's exactly what I'd use
if I was trying to kill witches.

00:46.742 --> 00:49.136
And that's why you just
can't heal the wound.

00:49.179 --> 00:51.355
They must have found a way
to become immune to magic.

00:51.399 --> 00:53.444
Okay, but I know Niko,

00:53.488 --> 00:56.143
and she would never
help people like that.

00:56.186 --> 00:58.449
Whoever they were, they
must have duped her,

00:58.493 --> 00:59.842
posing as your parents.

00:59.885 --> 01:01.148
Then it sounds like
you and I need

01:01.191 --> 01:03.063
to have a little chat
with your ex.

01:03.106 --> 01:05.108
Before we do that...

01:05.152 --> 01:08.416
there's something
that you should know.

01:10.244 --> 01:12.550
Niko has no clue that
she and I ever dated.

01:12.594 --> 01:14.770
You Eternal Sunshined her?

01:16.076 --> 01:17.860
Damn, Vera.

01:17.903 --> 01:20.123
There was a demon, and
he would have stopped

01:20.167 --> 01:22.560
at nothing to kill her,
and my only choice was

01:22.604 --> 01:24.040
to make it so that
she and I never met.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.868
A history rewriting spell?

01:25.911 --> 01:27.609
You must have really loved her.

01:27.652 --> 01:30.220
I did, but it's over,

01:30.264 --> 01:32.222
obviously.
Yeah?

01:35.138 --> 01:38.663
The thing that I don't get,
given this epic love story,

01:38.707 --> 01:40.752
is why you didn't just use
the Akkadian Smokescreen.

01:40.796 --> 01:43.190
The what?It's like
a witness protection spell.

01:43.233 --> 01:45.279
It would have concealed Niko
from the demon

01:45.322 --> 01:46.671
without you two having
to cut ties.

01:46.715 --> 01:48.760
The Elders never told me
that was an option.

01:48.804 --> 01:49.892
Of course they didn't, Mel.

01:49.935 --> 01:51.546
You're not even human to them.

01:51.589 --> 01:52.764
Come on.
You're a Charmed One,

01:52.808 --> 01:54.766
a weapon
that they want to control,

01:54.810 --> 01:58.161
which means they get
to decide what spells you use,

01:58.205 --> 02:00.729
how powerful
you're allowed to become,

02:00.772 --> 02:02.644
and who you're allowed to love.

02:02.687 --> 02:05.081
But the real question is,
what are you gonna do about it?

02:05.125 --> 02:07.605
♪ I-I-I, I-I♪♪ I'm gonna, I'm gonna

02:07.649 --> 02:10.260
♪ I-I-I, I-I♪♪ I'm gonna, I'm gonna

02:10.304 --> 02:12.871
♪ I-I-I, I-I♪♪ I'm gonna, I'm gonna

02:12.915 --> 02:15.787
♪ Throw my head back
and hey... ♪

02:21.184 --> 02:22.707
Are we really doing this?

02:22.751 --> 02:23.926
Yeah.
Yeah?

02:23.969 --> 02:25.928
♪ In sheep's clothing

02:25.971 --> 02:28.148
You're sure you want to?More than anything.

02:28.191 --> 02:32.326
♪ Wolves in sheep's clothing

02:32.369 --> 02:33.849
♪ It's so you...

02:36.199 --> 02:38.549
Parker?

02:38.593 --> 02:40.725
What the hell just...

02:53.738 --> 02:56.132
Oh, wow. Huh.
Procrasti-baking?

02:56.176 --> 02:58.700
I'm trying not to think
about Galvin trekking

02:58.743 --> 03:01.311
through Jumanji, or whatever
island he's gone to,

03:01.355 --> 03:02.747
looking for my cure.

03:02.791 --> 03:04.836
Help yourself.

03:04.880 --> 03:07.361
Actually, I was hoping to
pick your brain about something.

03:07.404 --> 03:10.190
Oh, yeah? Try me.Something, uh,

03:10.233 --> 03:11.582
sex-related.

03:11.626 --> 03:14.672
Now that I am
officially in the club.
Sure.

03:14.716 --> 03:17.849
So, earlier today,
right before Parker and I

03:17.893 --> 03:20.809
were about to, you know,
do our thing,

03:20.852 --> 03:25.944
um, there was this
energy blast...

03:25.988 --> 03:27.250
...down there.

03:27.294 --> 03:32.864
Maggie, we're adults.

03:32.908 --> 03:34.692
You can say "orgasm"
in front of me.

03:34.736 --> 03:36.912
No. No, no, no.
No, no, this was, like,

03:36.955 --> 03:38.261
a light, and a loud bang,

03:38.305 --> 03:40.089
and Parker flew
across the room.

03:40.132 --> 03:42.439
Oh. That-that's not where
I thought the story was going.

03:42.483 --> 03:43.875
I always wanted the sex
to be explosive,

03:43.919 --> 03:46.095
just not... literally.

03:46.138 --> 03:48.271
If it makes you feel
any better, I lost control

03:48.315 --> 03:51.361
of my power in the moment, too.

03:51.405 --> 03:52.536
The bed levitated.

03:52.580 --> 03:54.843
Damn, girl.

03:54.886 --> 03:56.410
Yeah.

03:56.453 --> 03:58.281
You know, it kind of
sounds like the force field

03:58.325 --> 04:01.328
you manifested out of emotion
when we were fighting Alistair.

04:01.371 --> 04:04.592
Yeah, but...

04:04.635 --> 04:07.334
...why would my powers do that?
I want to be with Parker.

04:07.377 --> 04:09.771
Well, you did say
you were terrified

04:09.814 --> 04:11.251
that he might still hurt you.

04:11.294 --> 04:15.733
Oh, my God. Yes. Duh.

04:15.777 --> 04:18.214
My fear set off the sex bomb.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.390
Thank you. Oh, thank you.

04:20.434 --> 04:21.391
Yeah. Oh. You...

04:21.435 --> 04:23.306
You are the best.

04:23.350 --> 04:26.048
Ah. Okay, so,

04:26.091 --> 04:29.660
maybe if I'm just honest
with him and with myself,

04:29.704 --> 04:33.882
I can keep it under control.

04:33.925 --> 04:35.884
You smell something... burning?

04:35.927 --> 04:37.625
Oh, my God, Macy, your hand.

04:39.061 --> 04:40.062
Oh, my God.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.412
Harry!

04:42.456 --> 04:44.196
I didn't feel anything.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.633
Come here.

04:45.676 --> 04:48.244
Ah...
Sit down.

04:53.423 --> 04:55.556
HARRY:
The skin seems to be thickening,

04:55.599 --> 04:58.820
and the nerves fraying,

04:58.863 --> 05:01.431
dulling your pain receptors.

05:01.475 --> 05:02.650
Why would that happen?

05:02.693 --> 05:08.308
Well, these are common
characteristics...

05:08.351 --> 05:10.135
of a demon.

05:11.702 --> 05:14.923
Which means whatever
demon essence is in you

05:14.966 --> 05:17.752
could be presenting itself.

05:17.795 --> 05:20.798
Why now, after 29 years?

05:20.842 --> 05:25.020
Well, there are some things
beyond my scope of knowledge.

05:26.587 --> 05:30.678
Oh. Thanks.

05:30.721 --> 05:33.942
Macy, you really ought
to seek counsel from Charity.

05:33.985 --> 05:35.204
No way.

05:35.247 --> 05:36.945
Now, Melanie...We all remember

05:36.988 --> 05:39.382
the "counsel" she gave
when Angela Wu was possessed.

05:39.426 --> 05:41.210
Mel, I think Harry's right.She wanted us

05:41.253 --> 05:42.646
to murder our friend.

05:42.690 --> 05:44.387
Yeah, and then she changed
her mind and helped us.

05:44.431 --> 05:45.910
Did you know that
there was a way for me

05:45.954 --> 05:48.391
to keep Niko safe
without losing her?

05:48.435 --> 05:51.002
Wait, what?It's called
the Akkadian Smokescreen.

05:51.046 --> 05:52.395
HARRY :
I have heard
of no such spell.

05:52.439 --> 05:54.049
MEL : Because
the Elders kept it from us.

05:55.746 --> 05:56.921
MAGGIE :
We need Charity's help.

05:56.965 --> 05:58.401
MEL:
You can't trust them.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.621
HARRY: Mel, even if this
Smokescreen does exist,

06:00.664 --> 06:03.188
it's hardly a reason
to risk Macy's humanity.

06:03.232 --> 06:06.714
Can we all just...
please stop?

06:09.630 --> 06:12.284
I can't talk about this
right now.

06:12.328 --> 06:14.504
Macy.

06:19.466 --> 06:21.946
Macy, wait.

06:23.992 --> 06:24.993
That's great.

06:53.021 --> 06:55.371
I know it's not what
you want to hear,

06:55.415 --> 06:57.460
but after everything
I've been through...

06:57.504 --> 06:59.419
being sent to purgatory
by my evil twin...

06:59.462 --> 07:01.943
The kraken....getting eaten by a kraken...

07:01.986 --> 07:04.119
The Antichrist....giving birth
to the Antichrist.

07:04.162 --> 07:05.729
Twice.Twice.

07:05.773 --> 07:08.819
I need to be with
someone stable.

07:08.863 --> 07:11.692
And Gideon, that's not you.

07:11.735 --> 07:15.478
Well, don't just stand there,
say something.

07:18.089 --> 07:21.441
I guess I just never saw you
as the type to settle, Angelica.

07:21.484 --> 07:23.355
You're gonna talk about
your own big brother that way?

07:23.399 --> 07:24.966
You're damn right I am, Levi.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.101
Oh, hey.

07:30.145 --> 07:32.190
Well, I do love a warm welcome.

07:32.234 --> 07:35.759
Sorry, I-I... I thought
it maybe was Mel.

07:35.803 --> 07:37.761
Well, I hope you're not
up here hiding from her.

07:37.805 --> 07:40.198
No. The Wi-Fi's just better
up here.

07:40.242 --> 07:42.462
I am worried about her, though.

07:42.505 --> 07:45.334
If this whole Elder drama
creates a rift,

07:45.377 --> 07:47.510
Mel and I might end up
right back where we started

07:47.554 --> 07:48.293
when I first moved in.

07:48.337 --> 07:51.514
I understand.

07:51.558 --> 07:53.298
But I'd be remiss in my duties

07:53.342 --> 07:55.431
if I didn't inform you
there's far more at stake here

07:55.475 --> 07:57.302
than domestic bliss.

07:57.346 --> 07:59.783
Macy, without the Charmed Ones,
the world will succumb

07:59.827 --> 08:01.872
to the forces of evil.

08:01.916 --> 08:03.570
And without three
fully functioning witches,

08:03.613 --> 08:05.528
there are no Charmed Ones.

08:05.572 --> 08:07.661
So, please,

08:07.704 --> 08:10.185
for destiny's sake,

08:10.228 --> 08:12.840
call Charity.

08:14.363 --> 08:15.320
I'm sorry, I...

08:15.364 --> 08:17.279
I just can't right now.

08:17.322 --> 08:19.716
Now, if you don't mind,
I'm going to forget about

08:19.760 --> 08:23.677
my grim demonic reality and
binge-watch some mindless TV.

08:23.720 --> 08:27.419
Ooh, what are you watching?

08:27.463 --> 08:28.899
Oh, I...

08:28.943 --> 08:30.248
It's called Heaven's Vice.

08:30.292 --> 08:31.728
Never heard of it.

08:31.772 --> 08:33.817
That's probably because
you weren't a pre-teen geek

08:33.861 --> 08:34.949
in the late '90s.
Mm.

08:34.992 --> 08:37.386
But... it's about two brothers,

08:37.429 --> 08:40.476
named Gideon and Levi, who also
happen to be angels.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.217
They're sent down from Heaven
to kill demons

08:42.260 --> 08:44.306
and save mankind from the Devil.

08:44.349 --> 08:46.526
Sounds utterly preposterous.

08:50.399 --> 08:52.401
Vampire!

08:54.621 --> 08:58.059
I don't think we're
in Heaven anymore.

08:58.102 --> 08:59.234
Oh, brother.

08:59.277 --> 09:00.452
What?

09:00.496 --> 09:01.976
Well, the writing's
a bit lazy.

09:02.019 --> 09:03.368
Don't you think?

09:03.412 --> 09:05.196
That's their catchphrase.

09:05.240 --> 09:07.590
Very well.

09:07.634 --> 09:10.375
Just don't stay up too late
bingeing this nonsense.

09:10.419 --> 09:11.420
Good night, Harry.

09:13.422 --> 09:15.859
Good night.

09:15.903 --> 09:17.948
Okay.

09:19.254 --> 09:21.256
LEVI:
Did you bring the silver knife?

09:21.299 --> 09:23.606
GIDEON: Uh, yeah. How dumb
do you think I look?

09:23.650 --> 09:25.390
LEVI: You don't want me
to answer that.

09:25.434 --> 09:26.566
Oh, shoot.

09:26.609 --> 09:29.743
Oh, uh...

09:44.714 --> 09:45.672
What?

09:50.546 --> 09:53.244
Guys?

09:56.334 --> 09:57.553
Oh!

10:06.562 --> 10:10.044
I don't think
we're in Heaven anymore.

10:10.087 --> 10:11.698
Oh, brother.

10:11.741 --> 10:12.829
Oh, brother.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.448
Oh.

10:23.492 --> 10:24.711
How'd you do it, demon?

10:24.754 --> 10:25.799
LEVI:
By the power

10:25.842 --> 10:26.930
vested in us
by the Big Man Upstairs,

10:26.974 --> 10:28.323
we demand answers.

10:28.366 --> 10:30.499
Levi?

10:30.542 --> 10:32.501
Gideon? Wait.

10:32.544 --> 10:34.024
LEVI:
She knows our names.

10:34.068 --> 10:35.591
What are you,
some kind of oracle?

10:35.635 --> 10:37.375
Is this a weapon?No. No, no, no, no.

10:37.419 --> 10:39.639
No. No, I-I'm a fan.

10:41.205 --> 10:43.555
Maybe we could take a selfie?

10:43.599 --> 10:46.167
Well, whatever she is,
she's stark raving mad.

10:46.210 --> 10:47.385
Demon.

10:47.429 --> 10:49.039
Oracle.

10:49.083 --> 10:51.433
Tell us where we are,
or we will destroy you.

10:51.476 --> 10:53.827
One moment we were in pursuit
of a vampire.

10:53.870 --> 10:57.004
The next moment, your portal
snatched us and brought us here.

11:07.536 --> 11:11.322
This isn't over... oracle.

11:11.366 --> 11:13.542
Uh...

11:25.162 --> 11:26.860
Was that a...

11:26.903 --> 11:29.123
...vampire?

11:37.348 --> 11:38.959
Oh, my...

11:43.964 --> 11:46.488
Tell me those weren't the boys
from your guilty pleasure.

11:46.531 --> 11:48.533
Maybe.

11:51.580 --> 11:53.625
You said to stab it with silver.

11:53.669 --> 11:55.105
Well, that's what
the scroll said.

11:55.149 --> 11:58.674
At least, I think
it's what it said.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.371
My Romanian isn't
what it used to be.

12:00.415 --> 12:02.722
I know this part. Levi,

12:02.765 --> 12:04.375
you mistranslated
the scroll,

12:04.419 --> 12:06.464
thinking it said to stab
him quickly with silver.

12:06.508 --> 12:08.728
when really it said to
stab it with quicksilver.

12:08.771 --> 12:10.599
Which is the ancient
name for liquid mercury.

12:14.429 --> 12:15.560
Whoa.

12:15.604 --> 12:17.867
Think I got
some vampire on me.

12:19.826 --> 12:21.349
Yes.

12:21.392 --> 12:25.048
Not bad, for a girl.

12:25.092 --> 12:27.747
I beg your pardon, "for a girl"?

12:27.790 --> 12:29.487
I'll have you know,
you are in the presence

12:29.531 --> 12:31.620
of a women's studies
professor and a woman

12:31.663 --> 12:33.665
who just so happens to
be a doctor of genetics.

12:39.846 --> 12:41.804
Sorry.

12:41.848 --> 12:44.459
Yeah, y-you're right, Harry.

12:44.502 --> 12:47.070
It's not their fault.

12:47.114 --> 12:49.551
Woke wasn't a thing
yet in the '90s.

12:52.336 --> 12:54.338
Mm. This is amazing.

12:54.382 --> 12:56.558
Is there anything you can't do?

12:56.601 --> 12:58.821
Uh, bake, actually.

12:58.865 --> 13:02.085
My sister made these. I figured
I should come bearing treats

13:02.129 --> 13:04.261
after what happened
earlier with the...

13:04.305 --> 13:06.916
while we were...

13:06.960 --> 13:08.396
Yeah. That was, uh...

13:08.439 --> 13:11.965
Definitely not how I fantasized
our first time being.

13:12.008 --> 13:14.750
Not that I fantasize about you
with a, uh, magical orb

13:14.794 --> 13:17.274
or anything,
that would be so weird.

13:17.318 --> 13:19.320
Maggie, it wasn't
your fault.

13:19.363 --> 13:22.540
Yeah, it was.
I set off the sex bomb.

13:22.584 --> 13:24.064
You what?

13:24.107 --> 13:25.761
Not on purpose.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.502
It's just, my powers
have been expanding,

13:27.545 --> 13:28.720
and I've been doing this thing

13:28.764 --> 13:30.070
where I manifest energy
out of raw emotion.

13:30.113 --> 13:32.855
So when I blasted you
across the room,

13:32.899 --> 13:36.032
I think that was me
manifesting my own fear.

13:36.076 --> 13:38.861
What, you're still
that scared of me?No.

13:38.905 --> 13:44.258
No-- uh, well, technically, yes,
but only because I never know

13:44.301 --> 13:47.652
if you're gonna demon out on me
and ruin my life again.

13:47.696 --> 13:48.871
Wow.

13:48.915 --> 13:51.178
But it's okay.

13:51.221 --> 13:53.745
As long as I'm open and tell you
before I get scared,

13:53.789 --> 13:55.399
we will be fine.

13:55.443 --> 13:57.097
No more sex bombs.W-What about...

13:57.140 --> 13:59.969
♪ You can't step up to me
if you shy ♪

14:00.013 --> 14:02.363
♪ Boy, you keep looking at me,
you're watching ♪

14:02.406 --> 14:04.495
♪ You're waiting,
you like what you see ♪

14:04.539 --> 14:06.715
♪ Your eyes saying
"Come here" to me ♪

14:06.758 --> 14:08.412
♪ You're trying to do
the impossible... ♪

14:08.456 --> 14:10.719
Would it help
if you were on top?

14:10.762 --> 14:12.199
No, it's not-- there's...

14:12.242 --> 14:14.723
a lot on my mind right now.

14:14.766 --> 14:15.985
Well, I could do, like, a...

14:16.029 --> 14:18.596
I'm just not in the
mood, all right?

14:18.640 --> 14:20.076
And it'd be great

14:20.120 --> 14:22.905
if we could just not talk
about it anymore, please.

14:29.303 --> 14:32.523
NIKO:
Their names are
Jennifer and Jerry Finch Jr.

14:32.567 --> 14:34.221
Adopted children
of real estate mogul

14:34.264 --> 14:35.918
Gerald Finch.

14:35.962 --> 14:37.572
I don't know how a background
check didn't flag this

14:37.615 --> 14:39.748
when I took the case,
but this is on me.

14:43.708 --> 14:46.494
What?The Finches.

14:46.537 --> 14:48.278
They built a fortune
through money laundering

14:48.322 --> 14:49.671
and tax evasion.

14:49.714 --> 14:52.326
So two years ago,
I put a hex on their dad,

14:52.369 --> 14:54.632
forcing him to give
everything away to charity.

14:54.676 --> 14:57.113
His kids must have found out,
and this is all revenge

14:57.157 --> 14:59.289
for emptying their trust funds?

14:59.333 --> 15:01.335
That's what I'm thinking.

15:03.859 --> 15:05.774
You can restart time now.

15:05.817 --> 15:07.515
Oh, yeah. Right.

15:14.348 --> 15:17.307
Ah. I love The Cure.

15:17.351 --> 15:18.961
Best album ever.Best album ever.

15:20.006 --> 15:21.616
Yeah.

15:21.659 --> 15:23.313
I have it on
vinyl, too.

15:23.357 --> 15:24.793
Original pressing.

15:25.837 --> 15:27.970
Anyway, the Finches.

15:28.014 --> 15:29.537
I told them I didn't care
what they did to you,

15:29.580 --> 15:31.365
so long as they pay me, so they
agreed to another meeting.

15:31.408 --> 15:33.802
But Jada, I'm gonna need you
there to help me draw them out.

15:33.845 --> 15:35.195
Won't that be dangerous?

15:35.238 --> 15:36.370
I already brought in local PD.

15:36.413 --> 15:37.893
So as soon as we make contact,

15:37.937 --> 15:39.416
they'll move in
and make the arrest.

15:43.812 --> 15:46.336
We can't just send her in
there with witch hunters.

15:46.380 --> 15:47.337
Relax, Mel.

15:47.381 --> 15:49.513
Your girl can handle herself.

15:49.557 --> 15:50.514
She's not my girl.

15:50.558 --> 15:53.300
"Best album ever."

15:53.343 --> 15:55.693
The Cure was kind of our thing.

15:55.737 --> 15:57.434
I'm sorry.

15:57.478 --> 16:00.307
Don't worry,
I'm not gonna put her in danger.

16:00.350 --> 16:02.004
I just need her
to lead me there.

16:02.048 --> 16:03.963
Then I'll take care
of the Finches myself.

16:09.272 --> 16:10.926
MEL:
Fine.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.362
But I'm going with you.

16:12.406 --> 16:13.798
Okay.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.018
Trust me, Mel,

16:16.062 --> 16:18.586
I will keep your
girlfriend safe.

16:20.631 --> 16:22.285
Mm.
Wow.

16:22.329 --> 16:24.984
I know it's hard,
but we've got to figure out

16:25.027 --> 16:26.855
how you summoned
these characters.

16:26.898 --> 16:28.596
Can you recall anything unusual

16:28.639 --> 16:29.858
that happened
while you were watching

16:29.901 --> 16:31.599
your television
program?

16:31.642 --> 16:34.254
Well, I-I did spill
some essential oil

16:34.297 --> 16:36.038
on the Wi-Fi router.

16:36.082 --> 16:37.387
Well, that hardly seems unusual.

16:37.431 --> 16:40.086
No, no. It was Marisol's.

16:40.129 --> 16:41.739
Oh.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.437
I tried one called "Escape,"

16:43.480 --> 16:45.395
thinking it meant
an emotional escape.

16:45.439 --> 16:47.354
But I-I guess she was being
a bit more literal,

16:47.397 --> 16:49.965
considering it opened up
a portal into the show.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.272
Oh, no, I see, I see.Wow.

16:52.315 --> 16:53.708
They're harmless.

16:53.751 --> 16:56.885
Do we really have
to send them back?
Macy,

16:56.928 --> 16:59.540
wake up. This isn't some
innocent piece of fan fiction.

17:10.377 --> 17:11.595
Be careful.

17:11.639 --> 17:13.467
If the boundary between
our reality and theirs

17:13.510 --> 17:17.297
is weakening, you never know
what might try to...

17:32.181 --> 17:33.791
Maybe that's a TV prop.

17:38.405 --> 17:41.277
Not a prop.

17:53.768 --> 17:55.770
That demon's called a Galimori.

17:55.813 --> 17:57.293
A minion of the Devil.

17:57.337 --> 17:58.903
It's going to try to
round up innocent lives

17:58.947 --> 18:00.514
to sacrifice
before its master.

18:00.557 --> 18:02.864
And I know we, eventually,
will have to send

18:02.907 --> 18:04.996
the angels back to stop anything
coming through that portal,

18:05.040 --> 18:08.087
but we really should
kill that demon first.

18:08.130 --> 18:10.089
Is that how I sound
when I explain things to you?

18:12.439 --> 18:14.093
Quick.

18:14.136 --> 18:15.964
I'll drive.

18:16.007 --> 18:18.793
I'll sit in the back.

18:25.887 --> 18:27.802
You're getting married?

18:27.845 --> 18:30.152
: Oh, yeah, later
this spring. Could you just toss

18:30.196 --> 18:32.415
those in the back for me?:
Yeah.

18:32.459 --> 18:34.591
Yeah, that's soon.

18:34.635 --> 18:36.637
Congrats.

18:36.680 --> 18:39.161
Yeah. C-Congratulations.

18:39.205 --> 18:41.424
Thank you. Yeah,
my fiancée Greta

18:41.468 --> 18:42.904
just wanted to do
the courthouse thing,

18:42.947 --> 18:45.124
but I was like, hell no.
Too many people fought

18:45.167 --> 18:46.516
for too many years
for us to get married

18:46.560 --> 18:48.257
in the same room as
a DUI hearing.

18:49.867 --> 18:52.174
Uh, but hey, shouldn't be
talking about this on the job.

18:52.218 --> 18:55.046
Why don't we go over the
plan once more on the drive?

19:01.662 --> 19:02.619
MACY:
Wait.

19:02.663 --> 19:04.230
Please.

19:04.273 --> 19:05.622
You can't take her
back with you,

19:05.666 --> 19:07.537
The... the sacrifice
isn't even real.

19:07.581 --> 19:08.712
You lie!

19:08.756 --> 19:10.149
Macy, what are you doing?

19:10.192 --> 19:12.499
Your master's not real, either.

19:12.542 --> 19:14.153
Same with the two
angel brothers.

19:14.196 --> 19:17.765
It's all fiction, pulled out
of an old TV show.

19:25.207 --> 19:26.513
GIDEON:
What's all this

19:26.556 --> 19:27.862
about a TV show?

19:34.738 --> 19:36.087
You said to stab it with silver.

19:36.131 --> 19:37.785
Well, that's what
the scroll said.

19:37.828 --> 19:39.395
At least I think
that's what it said.

19:40.744 --> 19:42.398
My Romanian
isn't what it used to be.

19:47.011 --> 19:49.797
Do you, uh,
do you want to see another?

19:50.885 --> 19:53.104
If I'm not real,
then why does my heart

19:53.148 --> 19:55.106
feel like it's gonna
burst out of my chest?

19:55.150 --> 19:57.152
'Cause you're a whiny
little bitch, Levi.

19:57.196 --> 20:00.329
You're just mad
that Angelica chose me.

20:00.373 --> 20:02.505
That screen doesn't
prove anything.

20:02.549 --> 20:04.942
Who's to say it's not just
documentary footage

20:04.986 --> 20:06.292
of our exploits?

20:06.335 --> 20:07.597
Or maybe, in our dimension,

20:07.641 --> 20:08.642
you're the one who's on

20:08.685 --> 20:10.731
some critically acclaimed
TV show.

20:10.774 --> 20:11.645
It's actually quite rubbish.

20:11.688 --> 20:13.734
You're not helping your case.

20:14.778 --> 20:17.694
Gideon, trust me, I get it.

20:17.738 --> 20:20.088
It's not easy confronting
a reality that scares you.

20:20.131 --> 20:21.785
You can't avoid it forever.

20:21.829 --> 20:23.222
What do you know?

20:24.745 --> 20:27.487
Well, I know what it was like
to be a lonely kid...

20:27.530 --> 20:29.532
who was bullied so much
I'd beg my dad

20:29.576 --> 20:30.794
not to send me back to school.

20:30.838 --> 20:33.144
I know what it was like
to turn on the TV

20:33.188 --> 20:34.450
every Tuesday
night at 8:00

20:34.494 --> 20:38.759
and find hope and inspiration
in two angels

20:38.802 --> 20:40.326
who were never afraid
of anything because

20:40.369 --> 20:42.763
they were responsible
for the fate of the world.

20:44.199 --> 20:47.202
That's why you have to go back.

20:47.246 --> 20:51.119
Whether it's real or not,
it's your world,

20:51.162 --> 20:54.470
and it needs you.

20:54.514 --> 20:57.125
She's right, brother.

21:00.128 --> 21:02.739
We can't run from our destiny.

21:06.743 --> 21:09.224
That's the spirit.

21:15.535 --> 21:18.712
Actually, before we go, Macy,

21:18.755 --> 21:20.235
I just wanted to say
thank you for

21:20.279 --> 21:22.063
all your help today

21:22.106 --> 21:23.717
and all your support
throughout the years.

21:23.760 --> 21:25.719
Oh, n--

21:27.068 --> 21:29.505
Well, I guess one hug
couldn't hurt.

21:31.072 --> 21:32.029
Thank you.

21:34.118 --> 21:36.860
Macy!

21:36.904 --> 21:38.688
What have you done?

21:38.732 --> 21:41.125
I set us free,
you little bitch.

21:41.169 --> 21:43.954
Now, come on,
let's go raise some hell.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.966
MACY:
What the hell?

21:56.010 --> 21:59.535
Hey, Macy, so something
happened, or didn't happen,

21:59.579 --> 22:00.797
while I was hooking up
with Parker,

22:00.841 --> 22:02.146
and I was wondering if...

22:02.190 --> 22:03.322
MACY:
Where'd the portal go?

22:03.365 --> 22:05.106
Macy?

22:09.328 --> 22:13.897
Please, tell me this isn't real.

22:13.941 --> 22:15.203
Harry, get us out of here.

22:15.246 --> 22:17.466
Hold on. I'll try
and take us back.

22:20.121 --> 22:22.384
Oh, no.

22:22.428 --> 22:24.168
Why are we still on the show?

22:24.212 --> 22:27.302
I suppose this means
I can't orb between realities.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.348
Well, there's still
the Escape oil.

22:29.391 --> 22:31.828
So we'll just get Mel and Maggie
to open up another portal.

22:31.872 --> 22:34.831
You mean this Escape oil?

22:36.572 --> 22:38.269
What?
I...

22:38.313 --> 22:41.490
Oh, my God, we're stuck
on a '90s TV show.

22:41.534 --> 22:44.363
This is bad, Macy.
This is very bad.

22:44.406 --> 22:47.844
Yeah, no !

22:47.888 --> 22:50.804
Ooh... broadcast standards.

22:53.807 --> 22:56.679
All right, the Finches are in
that next building over.

22:56.723 --> 22:58.464
I'll go in, and then
as soon as we make contact,

22:58.507 --> 22:59.856
I'll call in the cavalry.

22:59.900 --> 23:01.205
You ready?

23:06.036 --> 23:07.386
You still haven't told me
how we're gonna stop

23:07.429 --> 23:09.866
these witch hunters if we
can't use magic on them.

23:09.910 --> 23:11.781
It's easy.

23:11.825 --> 23:13.914
We use magic
on ourselves.

23:26.143 --> 23:28.798
They should have
been here by now.

23:28.842 --> 23:31.105
Calm down, Jerry.

23:31.148 --> 23:34.456
Look, I get that these rings
are supposed to block spells,

23:34.500 --> 23:37.328
but what if they
don't use spells?

23:37.372 --> 23:40.375
Wait. Did you hear something?

23:41.768 --> 23:43.509
You take the one on the left.
On three.

23:43.552 --> 23:46.947
One, two, three.

23:49.863 --> 23:51.168
Huh?

24:25.507 --> 24:27.466
Someone's been practicing.

24:28.641 --> 24:30.294
Yeah, well, don't get
too cocky.

24:30.338 --> 24:31.252
We still have to
take off their rings

24:31.295 --> 24:32.688
before they come to.

24:36.692 --> 24:38.259
These are spell blockers.

24:38.302 --> 24:41.480
I can't wipe her memory
with it on, but it's stuck.

24:43.438 --> 24:45.396
Come here. Cup your hands
around the ring.

24:45.440 --> 24:48.051
JADA: Close your eyes.
Now focus on it.

24:48.095 --> 24:51.272
Think about what it'll
look like a decade from now.

24:51.315 --> 24:53.883
Centuries...

24:53.927 --> 24:56.625
as it ages, deteriorates.

24:58.845 --> 25:00.324
Then release your breath.

25:04.459 --> 25:06.983
See what a time wish can do,
given the right guidance?

25:08.376 --> 25:10.639
I had no idea.

25:10.683 --> 25:12.249
Not to do the whole
broken record thing,

25:12.293 --> 25:13.990
but the Elders should have
shown you that months ago.

25:15.601 --> 25:18.342
Now, you tie up
the trust fund babies,

25:18.386 --> 25:20.562
I'll wipe their memories.

25:23.434 --> 25:26.307
Macy, this is of
the utmost importance.

25:26.350 --> 25:27.482
Where are we in the show?

25:27.526 --> 25:30.311
Which episode,
and how far into it?

25:30.354 --> 25:32.792
Oh, uh...

25:32.835 --> 25:36.012
Oh... I know this episode.

25:36.056 --> 25:37.579
It's the series finale.

25:37.623 --> 25:39.494
Angelica's here to
say good-bye to Gideon,

25:39.538 --> 25:41.452
but he doesn't show,
as usual.

25:41.496 --> 25:44.107
Angelica's going to go
and make a phone call,

25:44.151 --> 25:45.369
and then the Devil's
smoke will appear

25:45.413 --> 25:47.241
and whisk her off to his lair.

25:47.284 --> 25:50.244
Which means the series is over
in about 15 minutes.

25:50.287 --> 25:51.724
I was afraid you might say that.

25:51.767 --> 25:53.290
Why?

25:53.334 --> 25:56.424
The only thing tethering
our world to this show

25:56.467 --> 25:59.514
is the data streaming through
your router into your laptop.

25:59.558 --> 26:02.125
So, the moment
the data stream ends...

26:02.169 --> 26:03.736
We're stuck here forever.

26:03.779 --> 26:06.608
That's my guess.

26:06.652 --> 26:08.392
Then we only have one chance.

26:09.872 --> 26:12.266
Maggie!
Mel!

26:12.309 --> 26:15.878
HARRY: You must brew
another batch of Escape oil,

26:15.922 --> 26:18.446
and decant it onto
the Wi-Fi router

26:18.489 --> 26:19.621
to create a portal.

26:19.665 --> 26:21.797
Then find the angels
from this show

26:21.841 --> 26:23.712
and send them back through.Okay.

26:23.756 --> 26:26.410
And if they're not home,
go to the nearest bar.

26:26.454 --> 26:29.196
Gideon likes to go out drinking
at the end of every episode.

26:29.239 --> 26:31.807
You can do this, Mags.
There's still plenty of time.

26:31.851 --> 26:36.246
Just stay calm.
Oh, Macy, look out!

26:36.290 --> 26:38.292
We have to make sure
we're in the next scene.

26:40.120 --> 26:42.078
Mel?

26:42.122 --> 26:43.863
We have a situation.

26:57.398 --> 27:00.314
What a lovely day
for an apocalypse.

27:01.402 --> 27:03.491
That doesn't sound good.No.

27:03.534 --> 27:06.799
Do you remember
what happens next?

27:06.842 --> 27:09.236
Um, I think this is where.
they cut to a commercial.

27:16.504 --> 27:18.245
♪ When you touch the sky

27:18.288 --> 27:21.030
♪ You'll be flying
for the rest of your life... ♪

27:21.074 --> 27:23.772
Okay, you've had your fun.
Now it's time to go home.

27:23.816 --> 27:25.252
What for?

27:25.295 --> 27:27.254
That smoking-hot oracle
seems to know what she's doing.

27:27.297 --> 27:28.734
Let her save the world
for a while.

27:28.777 --> 27:30.083
But it's our world.

27:30.126 --> 27:31.693
Not anymore.

27:31.737 --> 27:33.390
♪ Way down in your soul...

27:35.610 --> 27:36.785
Did it hurt?

27:36.829 --> 27:38.265
Did what hurt?

27:38.308 --> 27:39.962
When you fell from heaven.

27:40.006 --> 27:42.965
'Cause when I did...

27:43.009 --> 27:46.229
it gave me this sick scar.

27:46.273 --> 27:48.362
Leave her alone, Gideon.Relax.

27:48.405 --> 27:49.668
I'm getting to know
the locals.

27:49.711 --> 27:51.713
God, you're such
a girl sometimes.

27:51.757 --> 27:54.673
Maybe, but I'm also the one
who got the girl,

27:54.716 --> 27:57.023
so what does that say
about you, huh?

28:02.942 --> 28:05.335
Even fictional guys are gross.

28:08.251 --> 28:10.558
I don't know you.

28:10.601 --> 28:13.169
Either of you.

28:13.213 --> 28:17.260
And yet, you were foolish enough
to intervene

28:17.304 --> 28:19.045
in the Devil's work.

28:19.088 --> 28:22.962
We're, um, friends
of Gideon and Levi.

28:23.005 --> 28:25.094
Yes.

28:25.138 --> 28:27.401
Well, then,

28:27.444 --> 28:30.404
then I'm sorry to say
your friends won't

28:30.447 --> 28:32.275
be long for this world.

28:32.319 --> 28:33.712
You see,

28:33.755 --> 28:35.844
I've left them with a truly

28:35.888 --> 28:37.541
diabolical dilemma.

28:39.543 --> 28:41.371
They choose to save the girl...

28:43.852 --> 28:46.899
...they'll open a hellgate
and unleash a horde of demons

28:46.942 --> 28:49.597
that'll destroy humanity.

28:49.640 --> 28:51.904
And the only thing
keeping the hellgate closed

28:51.947 --> 28:53.514
is her innocent blood.

28:53.557 --> 28:55.951
Yes. That's right.

28:55.995 --> 28:59.738
But if they choose to kill me,

28:59.781 --> 29:02.175
they'll die from the blowback.

29:02.218 --> 29:06.570
Because the only thing
strong enough to kill the Devil

29:06.614 --> 29:09.269
is the Devil himself.

29:09.312 --> 29:12.054
You know, I've
always wondered,

29:12.098 --> 29:13.577
why not just open
the hellgate yourself

29:13.621 --> 29:14.709
and end the world right now?

29:14.753 --> 29:15.884
It seems kind of
moustache-twirly

29:15.928 --> 29:16.885
to set up these
elaborate traps.

29:16.929 --> 29:19.496
Silence, mortal!

29:19.540 --> 29:22.978
How dare you question
the will of the Devil?

29:28.549 --> 29:30.029
HARRY:
This may not be the best time

29:30.072 --> 29:31.944
to go poking holes in poorly
written television stories.

29:31.987 --> 29:33.032
MACY:
I'm sorry.

29:33.075 --> 29:34.642
It's just always
bothered me.

29:34.685 --> 29:38.341
Yes, well, right now we have
far greater concerns.

29:38.385 --> 29:40.866
If Maggie and Mel can manage
to open a portal,

29:40.909 --> 29:43.433
we need to be certain the Devil
can't travel through with us.

29:43.477 --> 29:45.435
MACY: Then we have to
find a way to kill him.

29:45.479 --> 29:47.786
Good luck with that.

29:47.829 --> 29:50.005
The only thing strong
enough to kill the Devil

29:50.049 --> 29:51.615
is the Devil himself.The Devil himself.

29:51.659 --> 29:54.140
Yeah, we know. The red guy
literally just said that.

29:54.183 --> 29:55.750
But thanks.

29:55.794 --> 29:59.145
God, the characters on this show
repeat a lot of exposition.

30:02.496 --> 30:04.324
How about I just
orb out of the cage,

30:04.367 --> 30:05.716
pick up one of
those swords over there

30:05.760 --> 30:07.240
and drive it through
the Devil's heart?

30:07.283 --> 30:10.156
But the blowback will kill you.MACY: She's right.

30:10.199 --> 30:11.853
It's exactly what
Gideon did in the show.

30:11.897 --> 30:13.986
He sacrificed his own life
because of his unrequited love

30:14.029 --> 30:15.596
for Angelica.Then help me out of these

30:15.639 --> 30:17.163
and let me do it.

30:17.206 --> 30:20.166
I'd rather die fighting
than chained to some altar.

30:20.209 --> 30:23.038
No, you need to stay there
and keep the hellgate sealed.

30:23.082 --> 30:25.606
Now, Macy, come on, you know
this show better than anyone.

30:25.649 --> 30:28.087
What are we gonna do?

30:28.130 --> 30:29.436
I still don't get it.

30:29.479 --> 30:32.047
I mean, I'm handsome,
stylin'...

30:32.091 --> 30:34.441
abs like Swayze,
I got frosted tips.

30:34.484 --> 30:36.182
Why would Angelica
choose you?

30:36.225 --> 30:38.010
Well...

30:38.053 --> 30:39.489
because she always said
that with you,

30:39.533 --> 30:41.404
it was just having sex
and with me,

30:41.448 --> 30:44.233
it was making love.

30:45.539 --> 30:47.106
That's the wussiest
thing I've ever heard.

30:47.149 --> 30:48.063
Oh, come on.
There you go again.

30:48.107 --> 30:49.673
Running away
from your feelings.

30:49.717 --> 30:52.198
And yes, Gideon,
men do have feelings

30:52.241 --> 30:54.026
and sex is supposed
to mean something.

30:54.069 --> 30:57.203
It's not just rubbing
your tingly parts together.

30:57.246 --> 30:58.900
Wait. So, like,

30:58.944 --> 31:00.946
when a guy's not into it,
it's not because of something

31:00.989 --> 31:03.513
I'm doing, it's because
of how he's feeling?

31:03.557 --> 31:04.732
MEL:
Um...

31:04.775 --> 31:07.517
Not to interrupt
'90s sex-ed, but Maggie,

31:07.561 --> 31:08.867
it says here
that the Escape oil

31:08.910 --> 31:09.780
needs to brew for two weeks.

31:09.824 --> 31:11.217
What?

31:11.260 --> 31:13.872
We have two minutes.

31:13.915 --> 31:15.308
It's fine.

31:15.351 --> 31:17.310
I can do this.

31:32.716 --> 31:35.197
I've got it.
What if we use some of that rope

31:35.241 --> 31:36.459
to hold him down
while I...

31:36.503 --> 31:38.897
No, he'd burn
right through them.

31:38.940 --> 31:40.811
Maybe we should just wait

31:40.855 --> 31:42.291
for Gideon and Levi to get here.

31:42.335 --> 31:44.511
You know they're not
coming back.

31:44.554 --> 31:46.992
ANGELICA: Wh-What do you mean
they're not coming back?

31:47.035 --> 31:48.819
MACY: Gideon can't
handle responsibility.

31:48.863 --> 31:50.996
No, it's up
to us now.

31:52.040 --> 31:53.346
Now, I've been thinking

31:53.389 --> 31:55.304
about this stupid ending
for the past 20 years,

31:55.348 --> 31:57.350
so we're gonna do this my way.

31:57.393 --> 31:59.787
Whether you two like it
or not, okay?

32:00.831 --> 32:02.398
What's the plan?

32:03.965 --> 32:06.837
Ready?

32:09.231 --> 32:10.667
Let's do this.

32:41.916 --> 32:43.657
Hey.

32:47.269 --> 32:48.401
HARRY:
Got it.

32:49.880 --> 32:51.447
Show's over.

32:53.536 --> 32:55.756
No...!

32:59.412 --> 33:00.500
Oh, my God.

33:07.072 --> 33:09.335
You were right, brother.

33:09.378 --> 33:10.989
We belong in there.

33:11.032 --> 33:12.729
Time for me to get back
to my duties.

33:12.773 --> 33:14.905
I said "doodies."You said "doodies."

33:19.998 --> 33:21.825
Oh, my God.

33:23.349 --> 33:25.046
I love you, but I have
so many questions.

33:27.005 --> 33:29.529
It's been one
of those nights, huh?

33:29.572 --> 33:30.834
Yeah.

33:30.878 --> 33:32.140
Oh...

33:32.184 --> 33:33.185
Well done.

33:34.621 --> 33:37.450
Ready to say
good-bye?

33:37.493 --> 33:39.887
Yeah, yeah.

33:41.062 --> 33:42.542
You were great in there.

33:42.585 --> 33:44.065
Using the Devil's
own horn against him?

33:44.109 --> 33:45.284
That was brilliant.

33:45.327 --> 33:47.895
I learned from the best.

33:49.592 --> 33:51.942
Yeah, not bad...

33:51.986 --> 33:53.205
for a girl.

33:53.248 --> 33:55.294
Oh, Gideon.

33:55.337 --> 33:57.687
Just so you know, this
whole misogynistic,

33:57.731 --> 33:59.646

33:59.689 --> 34:01.082

a happy ending.

Thanks, Gideon.

34:33.158 --> 34:35.334
You know, now that
the Devil's gone,

34:35.377 --> 34:37.727
we're thinking about
taking a road trip.

34:37.771 --> 34:40.034

welcome to join.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.123

We may not be in Heaven
anymore, but...

34:44.865 --> 34:46.562
I think there's
still an angel

And I know you're not going
to like it, Mel, but...

35:11.413 --> 35:14.677
it's my body that's changing.

35:14.721 --> 35:15.504
I have to
make a choice

35:15.548 --> 35:17.376
that's right for me.

35:17.419 --> 35:18.986
And considering everything
that's at stake,

35:19.029 --> 35:20.988
I-I think I should get help
from Charity.

35:21.031 --> 35:23.817
She's been keeping things
from us from day one.

35:23.860 --> 35:25.384
Using that knowledge
to control us.

35:25.427 --> 35:27.168
No, we don't know that.

35:27.212 --> 35:28.996
We would have never been able
to open that portal

35:29.039 --> 35:31.955
if Jada hadn't shown me
how to expand my powers.

35:31.999 --> 35:33.392
Maggie, tell her.

35:33.435 --> 35:35.611
I don't want to get involved.

35:38.179 --> 35:39.789
I'm sorry, but...

35:39.833 --> 35:41.051
I have to.

35:41.095 --> 35:43.184
Fine.

35:43.228 --> 35:46.144
But I won't stand by
and be a part of it.

35:57.372 --> 35:58.808
Uh, it's an award-winning
documentary.

35:58.852 --> 36:00.419
What?

36:00.462 --> 36:01.855
Never mind.

36:01.898 --> 36:03.335
Carry on.

36:03.378 --> 36:05.206
Okay.

36:05.250 --> 36:07.165
Actually...

36:10.168 --> 36:12.170
Harry.

36:12.213 --> 36:14.607
I know how you feel
about Charity.

36:14.650 --> 36:16.261
But...

36:16.304 --> 36:18.524
I need you to be
honest with me.

36:18.567 --> 36:20.221
As a friend.

36:20.265 --> 36:21.962
Is it possible
she didn't tell me

36:22.005 --> 36:23.311
about the Acadian
Smokescreen because

36:23.355 --> 36:26.227
she wanted Niko
out of my life?

36:29.404 --> 36:32.190
The important thing
to bear in mind here

36:32.233 --> 36:33.234
is that fundamentally,
the Elders

36:33.278 --> 36:34.975
are good people who...

36:35.018 --> 36:38.370
They wanted
to let you rot in Tartarus.

36:42.156 --> 36:44.376
If Charity did
withhold the spell,

36:44.419 --> 36:46.465
I'm sure it was to protect you.

36:48.162 --> 36:49.903
To be certain,
your responsibilities

36:49.946 --> 36:52.035
as a Charmed One
came above all else.

36:53.123 --> 36:55.561
But yes...

36:55.604 --> 36:57.476
it is possible.

36:59.739 --> 37:01.349
Okay.

37:09.227 --> 37:11.533
It's a weird thing,
sex.

37:11.577 --> 37:14.362
You can think
about it constantly,

37:14.406 --> 37:15.798
talk about it incessantly

37:15.842 --> 37:18.279
and still not
understand it at all.

37:18.323 --> 37:20.020
Wait, can we go back to the part

37:20.063 --> 37:21.456
where you think about it
constantly?

37:26.635 --> 37:28.115

37:51.486 --> 37:53.793

And when you told me...

37:56.274 --> 37:57.492
