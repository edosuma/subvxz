WEBVTT

00:35.192 --> 00:36.893
Brian, honey, please
stop kicking the machine.

00:36.926 --> 00:37.894
It's brand new.

00:46.235 --> 00:47.037
Let's see.

00:50.106 --> 00:51.174
She's gonna love that.

00:53.109 --> 00:55.045
Why do I gotta have a sister?

00:58.981 --> 01:02.118
Brian, please.

01:05.254 --> 01:07.990
We have a lot to share,
and Aubrey needed a home.

01:08.024 --> 01:09.826
But she's not
part of our family.

01:11.328 --> 01:13.930
Just because she's
adopted does not mean

01:13.963 --> 01:15.331
that she's not
part of the family.

01:15.364 --> 01:16.299
You understand?

01:19.135 --> 01:20.938
Honey?

01:20.971 --> 01:21.939
I guess.

01:28.944 --> 01:30.814
What if Dad likes
her more than me?

01:32.549 --> 01:33.384
Oh, honey.

01:35.152 --> 01:38.456
Brian, your daddy
loves you very much.

01:40.156 --> 01:42.025
Nothing is ever
gonna change that.

01:50.200 --> 01:51.201
Hey, ever.

01:55.004 --> 01:56.405
So you be Mommy's
good little monster

01:56.438 --> 01:58.742
and try to like your new sister.

02:00.409 --> 02:01.944
I'll try.

02:01.977 --> 02:04.180
Okay,
that's all I want.

02:04.213 --> 02:05.548
Thank you.

02:05.581 --> 02:06.949
Ooh.

02:08.449 --> 02:10.787
Every time, you
scare me, every time.

02:14.157 --> 02:15.325
This is perfect.

04:37.434 --> 04:38.936
Brian, come on, honey,
uncross your arms.

04:38.968 --> 04:40.303
Come on, stand up straight.

05:07.096 --> 05:07.931
Hi.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.403
Say hello to your
new sister, Brian.

05:15.204 --> 05:16.039
Come on.

05:18.507 --> 05:19.342
Hi.

05:24.346 --> 05:26.317
Welcome to your
new home, Aubrey.

05:36.158 --> 05:37.760
"Do you know what
friendship is, he asked.

05:37.793 --> 05:39.395
"Yes, replied the gypsy.

05:39.428 --> 05:41.430
"It is to be a
brother and a sister."

05:41.463 --> 05:42.766
Very good, Aubrey.

05:42.798 --> 05:44.500
Okay, Brian, you read this one.

05:47.504 --> 05:51.408
"Two souls which touch

05:53.442 --> 05:54.544
"without."

05:56.379 --> 05:58.148
I don't know this word.

05:58.180 --> 05:59.582
That's okay, sound it out.

06:01.550 --> 06:03.019
"Mingling."

06:04.187 --> 06:05.489
Great
job, honey, yeah.

06:06.523 --> 06:07.524
That was good.

06:07.557 --> 06:08.425
Mm hmm.

06:09.391 --> 06:10.661
I don't wanna read anymore.

06:13.696 --> 06:15.265
Okay, well, you know what?

06:15.298 --> 06:16.500
It's getting late
anyway, so, Aubrey,

06:16.533 --> 06:19.269
why don't you go on,
and I'm gonna say

06:19.302 --> 06:20.470
goodnight to Brian,
and then I'm gonna

06:20.502 --> 06:21.471
come tuck you in.

06:25.175 --> 06:26.543
Oh, don't forget your book.

06:28.211 --> 06:29.213
Good night, Brian.

06:31.781 --> 06:32.615
Say it.

06:36.552 --> 06:37.387
Say it.

06:38.721 --> 06:39.555
Good night.

06:45.161 --> 06:47.129
Thank you, thank you.

06:47.163 --> 06:47.764
Thank you.

06:47.797 --> 06:49.366
Good night, Mommy.

06:49.399 --> 06:50.533
Good night, baby!

06:50.567 --> 06:51.435
Good night, baby!

06:51.468 --> 06:52.669
Good night, baby!

06:52.701 --> 06:54.103
Good night, good
night, good night!

06:56.172 --> 06:58.442
Okay, okay.

06:58.475 --> 07:00.244
All right, I love
you, get in there.

07:05.415 --> 07:06.383
Brian hates me.

07:08.584 --> 07:11.253
Oh, honey, he
doesn't hate you.

07:11.286 --> 07:13.089
It's just gonna take some time.

07:14.524 --> 07:16.793
You'll see, I bet it'll be
a much better day tomorrow.

07:19.862 --> 07:21.264
I don't hate him.

07:22.764 --> 07:24.435
Aubrey, you are so sweet.

07:25.535 --> 07:27.404
And so is Brian.

07:27.437 --> 07:31.108
He's just, he's a
little different.

07:32.475 --> 07:35.212
He really doesn't mean all
the bad things he says.

07:36.812 --> 07:38.380
You understand?

07:38.413 --> 07:39.248
Mm hmm.

07:45.187 --> 07:46.322
Wait a second.

07:56.499 --> 07:57.835
Aw, he's cute.

07:59.334 --> 08:01.437
This is Mr. Wiggles.

08:01.471 --> 08:02.406
My parents gave him to me,

08:02.439 --> 08:05.475
so he used to be mine,
but now he's yours.

08:06.442 --> 08:07.311
Thank you.

08:09.913 --> 08:10.814
Um...

08:13.348 --> 08:18.355
Oh, well, you can call me
Mommy or whatever you'd like.

08:25.562 --> 08:27.230
Thank you, Mommy.

08:30.567 --> 08:31.535
I like that.

08:32.769 --> 08:33.937
I like that.

08:33.970 --> 08:34.804
Here.

08:38.774 --> 08:40.677
Okay, now you go to bed
and, if you need anything,

08:40.710 --> 08:42.946
I'll be right down
the hall, okay?

08:42.979 --> 08:44.581
All right.

08:44.614 --> 08:45.415
All right.

08:45.447 --> 08:46.516
Oh, light on or off?

08:48.217 --> 08:49.452
- On, please.
- Okay.

08:58.794 --> 09:00.429
Nah, no.

09:00.462 --> 09:02.298
Yeah, no, I think
you should take it.

09:02.331 --> 09:04.533
Yeah, that house is gonna
go fast at that price.

09:04.567 --> 09:06.202
It's a good deal.

09:06.235 --> 09:08.205
We're not gonna find another
deal like that for a long time.

09:09.772 --> 09:12.542
No, inventory's way
low in that area.

09:12.575 --> 09:13.644
I'm telling you.

09:14.610 --> 09:16.745
Look, no, I gotta go.

09:16.778 --> 09:18.615
Think about what I said.

09:18.648 --> 09:20.917
Okay, I'll call
you in the morning.

09:20.950 --> 09:22.552
Okay, so long.

09:23.653 --> 09:24.488
Thank you.

09:26.688 --> 09:28.724
Brian, you haven't
touched your food.

09:28.758 --> 09:29.793
I'm not hungry.

09:30.893 --> 09:32.329
Brian, eat.

09:35.431 --> 09:36.865
How's your dinner, Aubrey?

09:36.899 --> 09:37.866
Good, thank you.

09:37.899 --> 09:38.735
Good.

09:45.942 --> 09:47.543
How was school this week, Brian?

09:50.947 --> 09:52.448
Brian.

09:52.481 --> 09:53.549
It was fine.

09:58.721 --> 10:01.258
Aubrey, you start next week.

10:01.291 --> 10:03.493
Canyon School, it's a
really great school.

10:03.525 --> 10:04.793
I think you're gonna like it.

10:04.826 --> 10:05.995
It sucks.

10:06.028 --> 10:07.630
Brian.

10:07.663 --> 10:08.497
Do you wanna go to
your room without supper?

10:08.530 --> 10:09.665
I don't care.

10:12.034 --> 10:13.937
Aubrey might like
the school, Brian.

10:19.775 --> 10:20.776
Get your own mommy.

10:22.044 --> 10:23.479
Damn it, Aubrey
is your sister,

10:23.513 --> 10:25.348
and you will treat
her with respect.

10:25.380 --> 10:26.283
You got it?

10:26.316 --> 10:27.617
John, please, just sit down.

10:27.649 --> 10:29.052
- Well do something!
- Okay, relax, please,

10:29.085 --> 10:29.920
sit down.

10:32.721 --> 10:34.423
Damn you.

10:34.456 --> 10:36.759
Jesus Christ, he's
out of control.

10:36.793 --> 10:38.461
John!

10:38.494 --> 10:39.629
Brian, come on.

10:41.931 --> 10:43.700
You're the therapist, fix him.

10:53.109 --> 10:55.979
Brian, honey, you can't
just act out like that.

10:56.011 --> 10:57.479
Dad likes her better than me.

10:57.513 --> 10:58.982
I knew it.

10:59.014 --> 11:00.317
That's not true.

11:04.754 --> 11:06.456
Do you like her
better than me?

11:07.557 --> 11:08.925
No!

11:08.957 --> 11:10.760
How could you even
think like that?

11:13.028 --> 11:16.499
Look, munchkin, Aubrey is
part of the family now,

11:16.532 --> 11:20.070
so you're just gonna have
to learn to accept that.

11:21.471 --> 11:23.773
So can you please
try, try for Mommy,

11:23.806 --> 11:26.810
just try to be nice to her?

11:26.842 --> 11:27.677
Please.

11:32.548 --> 11:33.616
Oh, baby.

11:35.684 --> 11:36.752
It's okay.

11:38.086 --> 11:39.722
Oh, it's gonna be okay.

11:43.926 --> 11:44.961
Mommy's here.

11:47.562 --> 11:48.564
Mommy's here.

11:57.673 --> 12:00.509
So, did you tell your dad
you wanna quit Boy Scouts?

12:01.711 --> 12:03.647
No, well, not yet.

12:04.846 --> 12:06.783
That was your assignment
last week, Tony.

12:06.816 --> 12:07.850
Why didn't you do it?

12:16.692 --> 12:19.095
He just doesn't
wanna hear my feelings.

12:19.128 --> 12:21.998
You're making up your
dad's mind for him.

12:22.030 --> 12:24.666
I just don't know
how to tell him.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.436
You just be honest.

12:26.469 --> 12:27.871
Yeah, there's no easy way.

12:27.903 --> 12:28.737
You just tell him.

12:28.772 --> 12:30.907
Why are you drawing
that stupid pig?

12:30.940 --> 12:31.842
It's for Mommy.

12:32.707 --> 12:34.076
It's just some dirty old pig.

12:35.144 --> 12:36.613
Give him back, he's not yours.

12:36.645 --> 12:37.813
What if I don't?

12:37.846 --> 12:39.816
Tony, I wanna help you,

12:39.849 --> 12:43.787
but therapy is not just you
telling me your feelings,

12:43.820 --> 12:46.589
you have to go home and
do the work, too, yeah?

12:46.621 --> 12:47.956
- Yeah.
- You can't just keep

12:47.990 --> 12:49.491
all your feelings bottled up.

12:49.524 --> 12:50.759
I'll scream!

12:50.793 --> 12:52.962
Scream and I'll
rip his arm off.

12:54.764 --> 12:55.697
Give him back now!

12:58.801 --> 12:59.735
Wait here.

13:06.241 --> 13:08.444
What's going on out here?

13:08.477 --> 13:09.111
He bit me!

13:09.144 --> 13:10.913
Oh my God.

13:12.215 --> 13:14.750
She hit me first!

13:14.783 --> 13:15.684
He really did it.

13:15.719 --> 13:18.655
Oh, sweetie, come
on, let's go inside.

13:18.687 --> 13:20.523
I'll deal with you later.

13:42.245 --> 13:43.613
This was a bad idea.

13:45.615 --> 13:47.149
Maybe we should
just take her back.

13:48.518 --> 13:50.253
She's a child, John.

13:50.285 --> 13:52.455
She's not some broken toaster.

13:53.755 --> 13:55.958
We adopted her and she's
part of our family now.

13:59.595 --> 14:00.763
Well, what about Brian?

14:00.796 --> 14:03.266
You gonna hold his hand and
explain things to him, huh?

14:03.298 --> 14:04.967
That's not fair.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.903
You coddle him, Deb.

14:06.936 --> 14:08.605
It doesn't help.

14:08.638 --> 14:10.907
Really, well would it hurt
you to try a little coddling?

14:12.674 --> 14:13.976
I wonder where he
gets his anger from.

14:14.009 --> 14:15.912
He got spanked,
Deb, he deserved it.

14:15.945 --> 14:16.980
- What?
- He deserved it.

14:17.013 --> 14:19.048
Wow, yeah, okay, wow.

14:30.125 --> 14:30.927
I'm sorry.

14:36.631 --> 14:38.067
I don't know how
to handle Brian.

14:40.870 --> 14:42.004
I'm doing my best here.

14:45.975 --> 14:46.810
I know.

14:48.910 --> 14:50.846
I know, I know you are.

14:52.148 --> 14:53.884
But we can't give up on him

14:55.051 --> 14:59.022
or work so much that
you're not around

14:59.054 --> 14:59.889
to deal with him.

15:01.023 --> 15:02.158
You figured that out.

15:04.624 --> 15:04.961
Yeah.

15:04.994 --> 15:06.963
Well, I think he senses it, too.

15:08.898 --> 15:12.101
You just need to try a
little, John, please.

15:13.735 --> 15:14.870
He needs his dad.

15:17.940 --> 15:18.975
I'll try.

15:21.076 --> 15:21.977
I love you.

15:22.010 --> 15:24.012
I love you, too.

15:44.700 --> 15:49.372
He'll be
with you in just a moment.

15:49.404 --> 15:50.807
This guy's costing me.

16:01.082 --> 16:02.618
I hope this guy's good.

16:03.753 --> 16:05.355
Yeah, he came
highly recommended.

16:07.923 --> 16:09.926
How long do I
have to do this for?

16:09.958 --> 16:11.727
Until you learn to act right.

16:11.760 --> 16:12.596
John.

16:16.399 --> 16:18.835
The Langston family.

16:18.868 --> 16:20.136
Hi, Dr. Keller.

16:20.168 --> 16:21.770
- I'm Debbie.
- Oh, Debbie.

16:21.803 --> 16:22.838
- This is my husband John.
- Nice to meet you.

16:22.871 --> 16:23.673
Pleasure.

16:23.706 --> 16:24.608
And you must be Brian.

16:26.741 --> 16:28.010
Say hello, Brian.

16:30.413 --> 16:32.815
That's quite all
right, young man.

16:32.847 --> 16:34.049
It's a pleasure to meet you.

16:38.287 --> 16:39.989
Do you want us to come in...

16:40.022 --> 16:41.958
No, no, I'd like to get to
know Brian on his own first.

16:43.125 --> 16:45.128
I can speak with you
after the session.

16:45.160 --> 16:46.962
There's a little
coffee shop downstairs.

16:46.995 --> 16:47.896
Why don't you wait there

16:47.929 --> 16:49.399
and be back in about an hour?

16:49.432 --> 16:50.233
Sounds good to me.

16:50.265 --> 16:51.700
- Great
- Good.

16:51.734 --> 16:53.870
Be good for the
doctor, okay, munchkin?

16:54.903 --> 16:56.905
All right, follow me, Brian.

16:56.938 --> 16:57.906
See you in a bit.

16:57.940 --> 16:58.942
Bye.

17:02.812 --> 17:06.048
You'll see, therapy's gonna
be the best thing for him.

17:06.082 --> 17:08.151
- I hope you're right.
- Yeah.

17:08.183 --> 17:08.983
Hi.

17:14.457 --> 17:17.193
You didn't wanna
come today, did you, Brian?

17:18.492 --> 17:19.962
Your parents are worried.

17:23.098 --> 17:24.299
I want us to be friends.

17:27.470 --> 17:31.040
I wanna understand
you and listen to you

17:32.141 --> 17:33.308
and hopefully help you.

17:35.144 --> 17:36.144
But, to do that, you and I

17:36.178 --> 17:38.048
have to be honest
with each other.

17:48.891 --> 17:50.293
No secrets between friends.

17:51.326 --> 17:51.961
Okay?

18:00.869 --> 18:02.938
You're a good boy, Brian.

18:04.306 --> 18:06.942
Most therapists would
suggest sending you away,

18:08.277 --> 18:08.911
but not me.

18:10.412 --> 18:12.215
I promise I can help you, Brian.

18:14.282 --> 18:15.851
I never break a promise.

18:19.188 --> 18:21.925
But you can't talk about
anything we do in this office,

18:24.192 --> 18:26.096
or else my therapy won't work.

18:27.930 --> 18:28.932
It's very important.

18:30.932 --> 18:32.434
I'd hate to see
you get sent away.

18:33.803 --> 18:34.738
Promise me.

18:36.971 --> 18:38.441
I promise.

18:38.473 --> 18:40.475
Good.

18:40.509 --> 18:42.111
Now we're getting somewhere.

18:45.980 --> 18:47.115
I'm gonna suggest
that we see each other

18:47.148 --> 18:49.050
twice a week for a while.

18:55.156 --> 18:56.458
You wanna get better, right?

18:59.228 --> 19:03.133
Physical contact is a
part of therapy, Brian.

19:04.232 --> 19:06.168
You're a good boy, Brian.

19:10.306 --> 19:11.507
You're a good boy.

19:47.308 --> 19:48.310
I'm
supposed to tell you

19:48.344 --> 19:49.412
I'm sorry I bit you.

19:53.915 --> 19:55.018
Why do you hate me?

20:27.682 --> 20:30.385
I'm sorry no one
showed up today.

20:30.419 --> 20:31.287
I don't care.

20:34.923 --> 20:35.523
Hi!

20:35.557 --> 20:37.559
Oh, hi, Gloria.

20:37.593 --> 20:39.528
- It has been forever!
- Yeah.

20:39.560 --> 20:41.364
Well I've been busy, you know.

20:41.396 --> 20:44.133
I mean, stop it.

20:44.165 --> 20:46.601
- Brian is 13 already.
- Mm hmm, yeah.

20:46.634 --> 20:47.436
What?

20:48.671 --> 20:50.439
Well where are all the friends?

20:50.471 --> 20:53.375
Oh, well, Brian's not
really a party person, so.

20:54.276 --> 20:55.577
Let's get this picture party

20:55.611 --> 20:56.646
- started!
- Oh, Gloria, no pictures.

20:56.679 --> 20:58.047
- Hey, Brian!
- Just listen.

20:58.079 --> 20:59.414
- Gloria.
- If I can just get

20:59.448 --> 21:00.149
- a big, happy...
- Gloria, would you stop!

21:00.182 --> 21:01.116
- Why?
- Stop!

21:06.689 --> 21:08.391
Whoa, Jesus!

21:08.423 --> 21:09.325
Fuck!

21:12.126 --> 21:14.230
Brian doesn't like to
get his picture taken.

21:17.532 --> 21:20.235
See, Brian, Gloria
didn't know, honey.

21:23.638 --> 21:24.573
I'm sorry, Brian.

21:26.075 --> 21:26.910
Brian!

21:36.151 --> 21:38.187
Are you sketching me?

21:38.220 --> 21:40.288
No, I promised I wouldn't.

21:40.321 --> 21:41.456
Can I see?

21:41.490 --> 21:43.192
You're not in it.

21:43.224 --> 21:45.327
I believe you,
I just wanna see.

21:47.296 --> 21:48.096
That's pretty.

21:49.530 --> 21:50.332
Thanks.

21:53.701 --> 21:56.505
Quit it, Nathan, or
I'm telling your mom!

21:56.538 --> 21:58.173
Is he bugging you?

21:58.207 --> 21:59.275
Just ignore him.

22:04.012 --> 22:06.281
I'm sorry Dad couldn't make it.

22:06.315 --> 22:07.150
I don't care.

22:08.182 --> 22:09.352
I don't believe that.

22:12.086 --> 22:15.257
Ow!

22:15.289 --> 22:16.425
I'm telling your mom!

22:27.336 --> 22:29.305
Wow, look at that,
the idiot can climb.

22:30.439 --> 22:31.673
You shouldn't have done that.

22:31.707 --> 22:34.243
Why don't you go
cry to your mommy?

22:34.276 --> 22:35.211
Weirdo.

22:35.243 --> 22:36.345
Stop calling me that.

22:36.377 --> 22:37.512
Or what?

22:37.546 --> 22:38.447
Let go.

22:38.480 --> 22:40.716
Weirdo vampire freak.

22:40.749 --> 22:43.451
Tell me, did you like
the taste of her blood?

23:43.644 --> 23:46.214
My name is Dr. Lewis.

23:46.248 --> 23:47.716
I've been appointed,
I've been appointed

23:47.749 --> 23:49.250
by the court, court,

23:49.284 --> 23:51.721
to psychologically
evaluate Brian.

23:53.521 --> 23:57.125
I'm going to ask a
few simple questions.

23:57.159 --> 23:58.494
Okay.

23:58.527 --> 24:00.430
Did anything
upset Brian at the party?

24:03.198 --> 24:04.432
Am I being filmed?

24:07.301 --> 24:09.237
You adopted Aubrey.

24:09.270 --> 24:10.505
Why?

24:10.538 --> 24:14.676
Because you were afraid
another biological child

24:14.710 --> 24:16.345
would turn out like Brian?

24:16.377 --> 24:18.379
Were you mad at your mother
the day of your birthday party?

24:18.413 --> 24:19.815
Thank you, Mommy.

24:19.847 --> 24:21.549
I like that.

24:21.583 --> 24:23.486
Your wife was adopted.

24:23.519 --> 24:26.188
You don't know
Debbie's birth parents.

24:26.221 --> 24:28.490
There could be a history
of mental disorder.

24:30.259 --> 24:32.361
Or maybe that's
crossed your mind.

24:32.394 --> 24:33.561
Excuse me?

24:33.595 --> 24:35.564
Answer the question.

24:35.596 --> 24:37.133
Has your brother ever hurt you?

24:38.901 --> 24:42.505
Do you think Brian pushed
Nathan out of the tree?

24:42.538 --> 24:44.205
I'll deal with you later.

24:44.239 --> 24:45.673
I believe what my son told me.

24:45.707 --> 24:46.876
No!

24:46.909 --> 24:48.544
So you can be MOmmy's
good little monster.

24:48.576 --> 24:49.744
I'll try.

24:51.212 --> 24:52.480
The truth is like a knife.

24:52.513 --> 24:54.616
It cuts through the lies.

24:54.650 --> 24:56.486
Did you wish Nathan was dead?

25:00.689 --> 25:02.358
Brian.

25:02.391 --> 25:03.558
I need you to calm down.

25:04.859 --> 25:07.328
Brian, I need you to calm down.

25:08.696 --> 25:10.665
Brian, calm down!

25:12.733 --> 25:16.172
Do you think your brother
pushed Nathan out of the tree?

25:24.645 --> 25:27.282
Brian!

25:28.616 --> 25:30.586
Get an orderly in here now!

25:31.686 --> 25:33.454
We need more help in here!

25:33.488 --> 25:34.623
Now!

25:42.597 --> 25:47.569
I've determined that your son
suffers from bipolar disorder

25:47.603 --> 25:50.506
with sociopathic tendencies.

25:50.538 --> 25:52.607
Your son needs
close supervision.

25:52.641 --> 25:55.744
I am going to
suggest to the court

25:55.777 --> 25:57.779
that he remain in
my care facility.

25:59.413 --> 26:02.917
After three months, you
can visit him every week.

26:02.951 --> 26:04.853
If all is going well,
he'll be allowed

26:04.885 --> 26:06.689
regular visits after that.

26:08.257 --> 26:10.692
Under my care and supervision,

26:10.726 --> 26:13.729
I believe we can save Brian.

26:13.761 --> 26:15.463
My son did not kill that boy.

26:15.497 --> 26:18.933
He is not in control
of his own actions.

26:18.967 --> 26:22.871
We are discussing a
severe mental disorder,

26:22.903 --> 26:24.873
and much more, rage.

26:24.905 --> 26:27.475
Something goes wrong
and Brian sees red.

26:27.509 --> 26:29.577
You'll be locking
up an innocent child.

26:29.611 --> 26:34.317
A boy is dead and it
is because of your son.

26:35.683 --> 26:38.686
I do believe he pushed
that boy out of that tree.

26:38.720 --> 26:42.424
But whether he meant to kill
him or not remains to be seen.

26:43.791 --> 26:46.561
He is not in control
of his own actions.

26:48.063 --> 26:51.801
Mommy,
it was an accident.

26:52.901 --> 26:54.769
In
Brian's mind, there is

26:54.803 --> 26:57.473
no alternative to violence.

26:58.740 --> 27:01.009
He lacks basic human empathy,

27:01.042 --> 27:04.646
to differentiate
between right and wrong.

27:07.949 --> 27:09.252
I believe you.

27:10.652 --> 27:15.324
I believe you.

27:19.594 --> 27:21.029
Today's the day, Brian.

27:22.631 --> 27:24.333
You are going home.

27:26.434 --> 27:28.870
I don't even know
what I'm going to say to him.

27:28.903 --> 27:30.705
How about welcome home?

27:30.739 --> 27:32.374
Funny.

27:32.406 --> 27:35.410
Aubrey, we've been
over this 1,000 times.

27:35.443 --> 27:37.546
Like, he literally
killed someone.

27:37.578 --> 27:38.547
Hey!

27:38.579 --> 27:39.682
We don't know that.

27:39.714 --> 27:41.683
You know, it's been six years.

27:41.717 --> 27:43.652
He's changed a lot since then.

27:43.684 --> 27:44.787
And you would've known that

27:44.819 --> 27:45.855
if you'd went to visit him.

27:45.887 --> 27:48.691
Remember
what I taught you, Brian.

27:49.857 --> 27:51.759
Don't take
things too personally.

27:51.792 --> 27:52.827
And?

27:54.061 --> 27:56.898
To speak my feelings
and to not bottle things up.

27:56.932 --> 27:58.933
And how will you
conduct yourself?

28:00.134 --> 28:01.569
I'm gonna treat others

28:01.603 --> 28:03.038
the way that I wanna be treated.

28:03.070 --> 28:06.675
So you just expect
me to be nice to him?

28:07.875 --> 28:10.511
Aubrey, he's already
gonna feel so awkward

28:10.545 --> 28:12.848
coming in and
living in this home.

28:12.881 --> 28:15.750
Would it kill you to just
make him feel welcome?

28:18.452 --> 28:19.355
Okay, but what Aubrey?

28:19.387 --> 28:21.656
She didn't come and visit me.

28:21.690 --> 28:23.392
Be patient with your sister.

28:25.394 --> 28:26.561
Okay.

28:26.595 --> 28:27.430
Good.

28:29.131 --> 28:32.835
I think you're
gonna do fine, Brian.

28:57.726 --> 28:58.794
Aubrey, they're here!

29:17.913 --> 29:18.881
Come on in.

29:29.023 --> 29:29.858
Hi.

29:31.159 --> 29:32.761
Brian.

29:32.794 --> 29:33.629
Hi, Brian.

29:34.496 --> 29:35.131
Honey.

29:42.136 --> 29:43.672
Aubrey, hug your brother.

29:46.974 --> 29:47.809
I'm going out.

29:48.977 --> 29:50.579
- Aubrey.
- Aubrey.

29:54.816 --> 29:56.951
I'm going to my room.

29:56.984 --> 29:58.887
She didn't mean it,
she just needs time.

30:30.285 --> 30:31.519
I love this drive.

30:34.955 --> 30:36.557
You must be hungry.

30:36.590 --> 30:38.926
We can get something
at the food court.

30:38.960 --> 30:41.663
There's a lot of new places
that you haven't tried.

30:44.566 --> 30:45.201
We can eat there.

30:58.913 --> 31:00.816
Okay, Brian, you wanna
tell me what's wrong?

31:01.982 --> 31:03.786
Why didn't you make
her come and see me?

31:05.586 --> 31:07.288
Honey, I suggested
it, you know.

31:07.321 --> 31:08.823
But she had her fears.

31:11.226 --> 31:13.863
You let her act like
that when I came home.

31:15.297 --> 31:16.899
She's doing the best she
can, just like you are.

31:16.932 --> 31:18.901
Why'd you have top
bring her to this family?

31:18.933 --> 31:19.969
Brian!

31:21.635 --> 31:23.105
You need to let this go.

31:23.137 --> 31:25.106
Brian, she's your sister.

31:25.140 --> 31:26.708
She's not my sister.

31:26.740 --> 31:28.609
Stop, she is, enough.

31:28.643 --> 31:32.014
She is your sister, and you
two have to work things out.

31:32.047 --> 31:34.115
Please, you gotta
let it go, all right?

31:38.219 --> 31:42.024
Look, just need to eat
something and relax.

31:44.192 --> 31:47.796
Let's just talk about
something else, okay?

31:47.828 --> 31:49.030
How about a little music?

31:52.000 --> 31:53.035
Brian?

31:55.036 --> 31:55.871
Honey, answer me.

31:58.707 --> 32:00.275
Brian, you're scaring me.

32:00.307 --> 32:01.544
Brian, talk to me!

32:02.309 --> 32:03.678
Brian, talk to me!

32:36.845 --> 32:37.913
Brian, help me.

32:42.784 --> 32:43.619
Oh, God.

32:45.787 --> 32:46.989
Brian, what are you doing?

32:47.021 --> 32:48.222
Brian, stop it!

32:48.256 --> 32:50.057
What are you doing?

32:50.090 --> 32:51.626
Brian, please stop!

32:54.362 --> 32:55.163
Brian, no!

33:43.044 --> 33:44.813
Mom.

33:44.846 --> 33:45.681
Mommy.

33:53.954 --> 33:54.789
Mom.

33:59.094 --> 34:01.830
Come on, come on, come
on, Mommy, I got you.

34:01.863 --> 34:02.497
Mom.

34:04.465 --> 34:06.367
Mommy, come on, I'm right here.

34:06.401 --> 34:07.903
Wake up, please.

34:07.935 --> 34:08.569
Help!

34:09.902 --> 34:12.306
Come on, Mommy, Mommy, come on!

34:15.242 --> 34:16.844
Help, somebody!

34:16.878 --> 34:18.713
Somebody fucking help me!

34:18.746 --> 34:20.114
Come on, wake up!

34:21.849 --> 34:23.451
Come on, Mommy,
come on, come on.

34:23.485 --> 34:27.255
Mommy, I'm sorry,
I'm so sorry.

34:27.288 --> 34:28.123
Help!

34:39.768 --> 34:44.106
Losing someone so close
to you can be very hard,

34:45.273 --> 34:47.909
as well as starting
a new school.

34:47.942 --> 34:50.177
That's not easy.

34:50.210 --> 34:51.846
Have you had any more...

34:51.880 --> 34:53.447
Suicidal thoughts?

34:53.481 --> 34:54.850
Yeah.

34:54.882 --> 34:56.451
Have you ever
attempted anything?

34:57.318 --> 34:58.854
No.

34:58.887 --> 35:00.822
I wouldn't actually do it.

35:00.855 --> 35:03.958
But even if I did,
nobody would miss me.

35:03.992 --> 35:06.394
That's not true, Brian.

35:06.427 --> 35:08.096
Who would miss me?

35:08.128 --> 35:09.163
Dad?

35:10.030 --> 35:11.866
What, Aubrey?

35:11.900 --> 35:13.101
I would.

35:13.134 --> 35:14.202
No, you wouldn't,
I guarantee that.

35:17.105 --> 35:18.407
- What's that?
- A gift.

35:20.240 --> 35:23.177
Yeah, a way for you to
take some positive steps

35:23.210 --> 35:27.314
to help you cope with everything
you've been going through.

35:27.347 --> 35:28.182
A diary?

35:29.416 --> 35:30.284
A journal.

35:31.518 --> 35:35.823
A safe space for you to express
your thoughts and feelings.

35:35.856 --> 35:38.092
Okay, I don't
see how this would help me.

35:38.126 --> 35:41.130
You know, when I was your age,

35:42.230 --> 35:45.132
I had it pretty
rough in school, too,

35:45.166 --> 35:49.505
and I kept a journal, and it was

35:50.905 --> 35:54.142
a wonderful place for me
to express my emotions.

35:54.175 --> 35:56.879
It was my little safe space.

36:00.248 --> 36:01.849
How long do
I have to do it for?

36:01.882 --> 36:03.451
As long as you want.

36:04.985 --> 36:08.022
As long as they are
your true feelings.

36:08.056 --> 36:10.492
There is no right
or wrong to this.

36:10.525 --> 36:11.393
Who's gonna read it?

36:11.425 --> 36:13.061
No one.

36:13.094 --> 36:15.896
Trust me, it's so therapeutic,

36:15.929 --> 36:18.567
getting whatever's stuck
up here in your mind

36:19.601 --> 36:20.936
onto the page.

36:23.905 --> 36:28.210
Ah, and here's a pen.

36:29.277 --> 36:32.213
It's a little uplifting gift

36:32.246 --> 36:36.117
to inspire you to get started.

36:37.217 --> 36:38.286
"Make it a good day."

36:38.318 --> 36:39.320
- Yeah.
- Really?

36:39.353 --> 36:40.254
Yeah.

36:40.289 --> 36:43.091
Because it's up to
you to make every day

36:43.123 --> 36:45.226
as good as it can be.

36:45.260 --> 36:46.528
And it's up to you to keep on...

36:46.561 --> 36:48.530
Okay, what if
I don't, what if I don't?

36:50.664 --> 36:53.601
I can't make you
do anything, Brian.

36:53.635 --> 36:56.271
I can't force you to do a thing,

36:56.304 --> 37:00.442
but will you at
least give it a try?

37:02.277 --> 37:06.146
Brian, I'm really
worried about you.

37:06.179 --> 37:11.185
Okay, but there is nothing
I can do to help you

37:11.920 --> 37:15.523
unless you allow me.

37:18.192 --> 37:20.596
Okay, I'll try it, for you.

37:22.297 --> 37:24.099
I'll try for you.

37:24.132 --> 37:26.869
Trust me, it'll be worth it.

38:07.342 --> 38:09.077
Hey, looking
at my girl, freak?

38:09.110 --> 38:10.479
Come on, give it back, Blake.

38:15.048 --> 38:16.384
Are you serious?

38:18.652 --> 38:20.421
There you go, little bitch.

38:20.454 --> 38:21.655
What you working on?

38:21.688 --> 38:23.090
"Oh, I wish I was
more like Blake

38:23.123 --> 38:24.326
"so I could get
laid more often."

38:24.358 --> 38:25.259
That's what you
should be writing.

38:25.293 --> 38:27.127
No, no, I'm just
finishing some homework.

38:27.161 --> 38:29.664
Oh, your mom didn't
finish your math for you?

38:29.697 --> 38:31.967
What you gonna do, pussy?

38:32.000 --> 38:32.634
Huh?

38:35.402 --> 38:37.204
- Huh?
- Blake, leave him alone.

38:37.237 --> 38:38.472
You got
lucky this time.

38:47.014 --> 38:48.682
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

38:48.715 --> 38:50.719
I don't know, Aubrey,
what am I doing?

38:50.751 --> 38:53.288
Can you be normal
for like five seconds?

38:53.320 --> 38:55.089
I'm not even doing
anything to you.

38:55.123 --> 38:58.492
You're being all super
creepy stalker with my friend.

38:58.525 --> 39:00.161
No, I'm not.

39:00.193 --> 39:01.996
When are you gonna get
it through your head,

39:02.030 --> 39:04.032
she doesn't like you, Brian?

39:04.065 --> 39:06.034
She never will, she's
got a boyfriend,

39:06.067 --> 39:07.335
and she's out of your league,

39:07.367 --> 39:09.170
and you're acting like a
gross, crazy little troll,

39:09.202 --> 39:10.471
so just stop!

39:14.675 --> 39:16.644
You're such a fucking bitch.

39:16.677 --> 39:18.646
I fucking hate you.

39:18.679 --> 39:20.115
God!

39:43.670 --> 39:44.471
Damn it.

39:58.518 --> 39:59.820
Brian!

40:05.425 --> 40:06.360
Brian!

40:12.800 --> 40:13.735
I was calling for you.

40:13.768 --> 40:15.135
Sorry, I've been practicing.

40:15.168 --> 40:16.538
I asked you to
clean up around here.

40:16.570 --> 40:17.338
Okay, I'll do it.

40:17.371 --> 40:19.273
I just need to
finish practicing.

40:19.306 --> 40:21.275
You know, Brian, I had a
hard fucking day at work.

40:21.309 --> 40:23.344
I don't wanna hear
your bullshit, come on.

40:23.376 --> 40:24.478
I just said I'll go and do it.

40:24.512 --> 40:25.480
Just give me a second.

40:25.512 --> 40:27.481
I'm going to do it, can
I just please finish?

40:28.682 --> 40:30.451
You know, Brian,
I get my work done

40:30.485 --> 40:33.354
and I come home, and
when I come home,

40:33.387 --> 40:35.155
I don't wanna have to
sit around in this filth!

40:35.188 --> 40:36.423
So go ask Aubrey to do it.

40:36.456 --> 40:37.458
You never tell her
to do anything.

40:37.492 --> 40:39.727
She does plenty around here.

40:39.760 --> 40:42.831
And she's got a job, and
she's saving for college.

40:42.864 --> 40:43.664
That's why I asked you to do it.

40:43.697 --> 40:44.632
I just need to finish.

40:44.664 --> 40:45.867
Just let me practice, please.

40:45.900 --> 40:46.768
I just need to practice.

40:46.800 --> 40:47.768
Ah, damn it!

40:49.503 --> 40:51.605
Get out there and clean up.

40:51.639 --> 40:52.474
Do it now!

40:53.807 --> 40:54.608
Now!

40:57.344 --> 40:58.145
Goddamn it!

41:09.489 --> 41:10.324
Stop.

41:12.260 --> 41:13.095
Stop!

41:14.762 --> 41:16.164
That'll be all.

41:16.197 --> 41:17.599
Sorry, I didn't have
enough time to practice.

41:17.632 --> 41:19.467
You had as much
time as everyone else.

41:19.500 --> 41:21.202
Yeah, but if I could audition
at the end of the week,

41:21.235 --> 41:23.338
- that'd be perfect.
- No, sorry, Brian.

41:23.371 --> 41:25.639
Today is the audition day.

41:25.672 --> 41:26.507
Pack it up.

41:32.679 --> 41:33.581
Next.

41:39.753 --> 41:40.721
Next!

41:50.831 --> 41:53.535
You have to
throw it in reverse.

41:57.605 --> 41:58.806
I love you.

42:11.719 --> 42:13.288
Shit.

42:13.320 --> 42:14.355
Hey, asshole!

42:19.760 --> 42:21.596
What the fuck is this?

42:22.730 --> 42:23.563
I was just watching.

42:23.597 --> 42:25.300
- I was with some friends.
- You sick fuck.

42:25.333 --> 42:26.668
I was taking
some pictures over there.

42:26.701 --> 42:27.601
Of my fucking
girlfriend, you sick fuck!

42:30.003 --> 42:31.806
Who the fuck else you
working with, huh?

42:31.838 --> 42:32.873
What you got in here, huh?

42:32.907 --> 42:34.943
Oh, a little diary.

42:34.976 --> 42:36.411
No, stop, give that back.

42:36.443 --> 42:37.344
Come on.

42:37.378 --> 42:38.346
What are you gonna do, huh?

42:38.378 --> 42:39.813
Bitch.

42:39.847 --> 42:41.449
Stay down, you little punk.

42:42.382 --> 42:43.384
Freak.

42:44.684 --> 42:46.721
Fucking stay down
or I'll wreck you.

42:46.753 --> 42:47.889
What the fuck is in here, huh?

42:47.922 --> 42:49.824
"Liz is perfect.

42:49.856 --> 42:51.559
"Liz is my everything."

42:51.592 --> 42:54.528
Oh, I can't wait to
fucking show Liz this.

42:54.561 --> 42:56.330
See what a fucking
creep you are.

42:56.364 --> 42:57.532
Come on, come on, you...

42:57.565 --> 42:59.567
Bro, you stay outta
my fucking face.

42:59.599 --> 43:03.237
You don't put your fucking
camera at my fucking girlfriend.

43:03.271 --> 43:06.240
Hey, don't ever look at my
fucking girlfriend again

43:06.273 --> 43:08.643
or I'll fucking murder you, bro.

43:08.675 --> 43:10.311
You don't even fucking
go to the same school

43:10.344 --> 43:12.981
as me anymore, all
right, you got that?

43:13.014 --> 43:14.216
Fucking creep.

43:16.317 --> 43:18.585
Stay down, you little asshole.

43:31.632 --> 43:33.835
He has it, he has it.

43:40.775 --> 43:43.010
Brian, what's
wrong, what happened?

43:43.043 --> 43:44.711
Calm down.

43:44.744 --> 43:47.047
- Brian, please-
- He has it.

43:47.081 --> 43:47.949
What happened?

43:47.981 --> 43:49.451
He has, fuck!

43:50.885 --> 43:52.420
Brian!

43:53.788 --> 43:57.291
Oh my God, please, talk to
me, talk to me, calm down!

43:57.324 --> 43:58.893
I can't do this anymore.

43:58.925 --> 44:00.460
I've tried to be a good person

44:00.494 --> 44:01.796
but they won't fucking let me!

44:01.829 --> 44:05.066
Who won't let
you be a good person?

44:05.099 --> 44:05.967
You don't
understand how fucking hard

44:06.000 --> 44:06.900
I'm trying here!

44:06.934 --> 44:08.436
You're not making any sense.

44:08.469 --> 44:10.438
You have to calm down.

44:14.775 --> 44:16.844
Brian, that's enough,
please, sit down.

44:16.876 --> 44:20.581
And you, you really
thought you're the one

44:20.614 --> 44:22.650
to finally fix me?

44:22.682 --> 44:26.019
I had licensed
fucking therapists

44:26.052 --> 44:27.989
help me over all these years,

44:28.021 --> 44:29.790
but what fucking good
did that do for me?

44:29.824 --> 44:32.026
So what did you think
that you would do?

44:32.059 --> 44:35.596
You expect me to be all
rainbows and sunshine

44:35.628 --> 44:37.097
and fucking unicorns.

44:37.130 --> 44:40.100
I've tried your
stupid-ass notebook,

44:40.134 --> 44:42.769
but what fucking good
did that do for me?

44:42.802 --> 44:46.673
You're just as fucking
useless as the rest of them.

44:46.706 --> 44:48.842
You sad, pathetic,
little lonely bitch!

44:48.876 --> 44:51.079
Oh my God, Brian,
that's enough.

44:51.112 --> 44:51.945
You sit down!

45:22.909 --> 45:25.045
What are you doing?

45:25.079 --> 45:26.981
Mrs. Perkins called me today.

45:29.416 --> 45:30.550
Yeah, I figured she would.

45:30.583 --> 45:32.586
Look, you got a
problem, you come to me.

45:34.521 --> 45:35.956
You're drunk, please.

45:37.858 --> 45:39.827
I've done nothing
but provide for you,

45:39.860 --> 45:41.062
you ungrateful little prick.

45:44.831 --> 45:46.067
And I know it was you, Brian.

45:48.501 --> 45:50.704
Your mother's death
was somehow your fault.

46:16.896 --> 46:17.831
Hey, asshole!

46:20.067 --> 46:21.068
Fuck you!

46:28.876 --> 46:30.044
Come here, you punk.

46:36.784 --> 46:37.684
Get you.

46:40.688 --> 46:41.588
Come here.

46:48.661 --> 46:50.897
That was all kinds
of fucking stupid.

46:50.931 --> 46:52.133
You gotta be a fucking idiot.

46:52.166 --> 46:53.734
I want my notebook back.

46:53.766 --> 46:55.902
Yeah, and what
do I get for it?

46:55.936 --> 46:57.704
This, I know you want it.

47:00.940 --> 47:02.976
The freak is negotiating.

47:03.010 --> 47:03.945
How fucking cute.

47:03.978 --> 47:05.579
I filled it with beer.

47:06.847 --> 47:09.584
You filled your
thermos with fucking beer

47:09.617 --> 47:12.753
so you can get your stupid,
little fucking diary back?

47:12.786 --> 47:13.887
Yeah.

47:13.920 --> 47:14.955
The fuck?

47:16.289 --> 47:17.891
Give me my notebook.

47:27.001 --> 47:27.902
That's in my locker,

47:29.269 --> 47:30.237
where it's staying.

47:44.018 --> 47:44.818
The fuck?

47:46.052 --> 47:47.554
The fuck did you do?

47:48.889 --> 47:49.923
What did you do, bro?

47:51.891 --> 47:53.994
Fuck, you did something.

47:54.027 --> 47:55.896
You little bitch, I'll
fucking murder you.

47:55.929 --> 47:57.531
What'd you put in that shit?

47:58.699 --> 48:00.902
Fucking weirdo, come on,
no, please, I'm sorry.

48:02.570 --> 48:04.972
No, no, no, no, bro.

48:07.974 --> 48:09.877
Oh, no, oh, shit.

48:13.280 --> 48:15.984
Fuck, no, come on,
no, come on, man.

48:17.117 --> 48:19.988
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

48:21.155 --> 48:24.592
No, come on, man, come
on, no, fuck, fuck!

48:24.625 --> 48:26.193
Oh, shit, fuck, fuck!

48:34.233 --> 48:36.036
Come on, man.

48:36.070 --> 48:38.205
Please, oh, God, no, fuck, no.

48:38.237 --> 48:40.607
I don't wanna fucking die.

48:42.108 --> 48:44.679
No, come on.

48:47.014 --> 48:50.718
Oh, come on.

48:50.751 --> 48:52.853
I'm fucking sorry.

48:56.056 --> 48:58.226
Come on, man, bro, please.

48:59.893 --> 49:01.628
Why the fuck can't
I use my legs?

49:01.661 --> 49:02.930
Oh God, please!

49:04.965 --> 49:06.233
Please, fuck.

50:32.119 --> 50:32.954
Fuck.

50:34.253 --> 50:35.088
Oh, shit.

50:36.356 --> 50:38.159
Wait a minute, where
the fuck is it?

50:41.829 --> 50:44.231
Shit.

50:44.264 --> 50:45.166
Shit, shit.

50:54.108 --> 50:55.743
Fuck, where is it?

51:00.246 --> 51:01.449
Where the fuck?

51:03.983 --> 51:05.018
You'll never get
away with this.

51:05.052 --> 51:06.153
- No.
- You're too lame

51:06.186 --> 51:07.121
- to pull this off.
- Shut up!

51:07.153 --> 51:08.422
They're gonna put
you away for the rest

51:08.454 --> 51:11.391
of your sick, perverted life.

51:11.425 --> 51:12.860
You might as well kill yourself.

51:12.893 --> 51:14.894
- No, no!
- You'll be better off.

51:14.927 --> 51:17.263
- The noose is right there.
- No, no, no!

51:22.369 --> 51:23.204
Fuck.

51:26.273 --> 51:28.209
Phone, where is his phone?

51:29.476 --> 51:31.244
Fuck!

52:41.215 --> 52:42.250
Hey!

52:46.186 --> 52:48.289
It was you, wasn't it?

52:48.322 --> 52:49.490
I don't know what
you're talking about.

52:49.523 --> 52:51.858
Blake's
missing, you hated him.

52:51.891 --> 52:53.160
What, you're delusional.

52:54.061 --> 52:55.563
Where is he, Brian?

52:56.463 --> 52:58.966
Where is he, what did you do?

52:58.998 --> 53:00.300
No, you don't
understand, it was him.

53:00.333 --> 53:03.069
He's freaking crazy,
he's in love with Liz,

53:03.103 --> 53:05.306
and he would've killed
me, you don't understand.

53:06.505 --> 53:08.074
He's killed.

53:13.280 --> 53:15.349
He killed Nathan, he
fucking pushed him

53:15.382 --> 53:20.086
out of the fucking tree.

53:20.119 --> 53:23.223
Brian, I need you in
the principal's office.

53:23.257 --> 53:24.224
For what?

53:24.257 --> 53:26.025
Come with me, please.

53:39.306 --> 53:40.507
Brian, I imagine you've heard

53:40.539 --> 53:43.344
that Blake Corbin was
found dead this morning.

53:44.244 --> 53:45.579
I heard he was missing.

53:45.612 --> 53:48.115
Why the hell was your
notebook found in his locker?

53:48.148 --> 53:49.383
He stole it from me.

53:49.416 --> 53:50.584
Why did
he steal it from you?

53:50.617 --> 53:51.952
'Cause he's an asshole.

53:51.985 --> 53:55.122
- Brian!
- My son was a good boy!

53:55.155 --> 53:57.391
No, your good boy
fucked with me every day.

53:57.423 --> 53:58.425
I swear to God, Brian,

53:58.458 --> 54:00.293
- stop it!
- Mr. Langston, please.

54:00.327 --> 54:04.632
Brian, we read some disturbing
things in your notebook.

54:10.036 --> 54:11.371
You said nobody
was gonna read that.

54:11.405 --> 54:12.606
You lied to me.

54:12.639 --> 54:14.242
Brian, where were
you this morning?

54:16.309 --> 54:17.143
In class.

54:19.413 --> 54:21.548
Your father said you
were out all night.

54:22.516 --> 54:24.018
So, what if I was?

54:24.050 --> 54:25.952
Tell us what
happened to him, Brian.

54:27.119 --> 54:28.054
Right now!

54:31.057 --> 54:32.259
Security is going to hold you

54:32.291 --> 54:34.929
until the police arrive.

54:34.961 --> 54:36.130
I didn't do anything.

54:36.163 --> 54:40.266
- You killed my son!
- I need your backpack.

54:43.003 --> 54:44.271
Brian!

54:48.708 --> 54:50.710
I'm
so sorry, I'm so sorry.

54:57.016 --> 54:58.251
Hey, hey,
hey, Brian, slow down.

54:58.284 --> 54:59.686
Keep running, loser!

55:06.659 --> 55:09.029
Run, boy, run!

55:20.306 --> 55:21.408
Get him out of here.

55:26.179 --> 55:28.715
You should have never
taken my notebook!

55:34.353 --> 55:35.388
No!

55:55.442 --> 55:56.409
What the fuck?

56:09.456 --> 56:10.291
Who are you?

56:17.530 --> 56:19.000
Answer me, come on!

56:20.534 --> 56:23.003
I am Dr. Hyland.

56:24.538 --> 56:27.108
We're going to be working
together for a while.

56:28.675 --> 56:31.178
Wait, wait, wait, what
the fuck are you doing?

56:31.210 --> 56:32.045
Helping you.

56:35.114 --> 56:36.783
Wait, but what
the fuck is this for, what?

56:36.817 --> 56:38.219
Exposure therapy.

56:41.521 --> 56:42.789
Wait, what the fuck
are you doing, though?

56:42.822 --> 56:44.490
Come on, what is this?

56:44.523 --> 56:47.226
I expose the patient to
a thing that they hate.

56:47.260 --> 56:49.030
By regular contact
with that thing,

56:50.130 --> 56:51.332
their issue is resolved.

56:54.501 --> 56:56.670
No, no, no, no, no,
no, come on, come on.

56:58.572 --> 56:59.573
Stop, stop!

57:05.545 --> 57:07.514
No, come on, stop, please!

57:09.148 --> 57:11.152
Oh, no!

57:11.885 --> 57:12.686
Stop.

57:20.460 --> 57:22.463
Wait, what the fuck is this?

57:24.130 --> 57:25.132
A word of caution,

57:27.601 --> 57:29.536
any negative
reaction will be met

57:29.568 --> 57:31.771
with far worse
negative reaction.

57:31.804 --> 57:36.376
No.

57:41.547 --> 57:42.348
Please.

57:50.623 --> 57:51.524
No, no, no!

57:55.594 --> 58:00.300
No, no.

58:14.614 --> 58:15.749
Stop, stop, stop!

58:20.586 --> 58:24.757
No, no!

58:43.309 --> 58:45.711
Why, why are you doing this?

58:45.744 --> 58:48.315
'Cause your
father was right about you,

58:48.347 --> 58:50.349
and your sister is terrified.

58:50.382 --> 58:52.352
She's not my sister!

59:12.739 --> 59:13.840
Please, stop.

01:00:37.791 --> 01:00:39.626
You nervous about going home?

01:00:42.896 --> 01:00:43.697
Yeah, a little.

01:00:49.668 --> 01:00:52.873
Well, you haven't had
an episode in over a year.

01:00:58.344 --> 01:01:00.346
I know, but my dad,
he's still there.

01:01:02.382 --> 01:01:03.017
I don't know.

01:01:03.882 --> 01:01:04.951
You have tools.

01:01:05.985 --> 01:01:07.488
You can deal with him now.

01:01:09.121 --> 01:01:10.456
I don't know if I can.

01:01:10.489 --> 01:01:11.758
You can and you will.

01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:14.695
Believe it.

01:01:17.097 --> 01:01:18.065
I can and I will.

01:01:24.704 --> 01:01:28.842
Look, just focus on
getting work and helping out,

01:01:28.875 --> 01:01:31.545
and your relationship with
your dad will improve.

01:01:48.862 --> 01:01:49.663
I hope so.

01:03:03.503 --> 01:03:05.606
I know, oatmeal again.

01:03:06.972 --> 01:03:08.808
I'm gonna go food shopping
tomorrow, all right?

01:03:16.081 --> 01:03:16.916
Come on.

01:03:24.891 --> 01:03:26.793
You're not even trying.

01:03:29.228 --> 01:03:31.931
You know what, you can
feed yourself then.

01:03:34.733 --> 01:03:35.536
Please.

01:04:13.005 --> 01:04:14.674
- Oh.
- Oh.

01:04:16.141 --> 01:04:17.710
I wasn't looking.

01:04:17.744 --> 01:04:20.180
Oh, no, you were looking,
just at your phone.

01:04:20.213 --> 01:04:20.981
Yeah.

01:04:21.014 --> 01:04:22.849
Right.

01:04:22.882 --> 01:04:23.717
Right.

01:04:25.818 --> 01:04:26.820
Oh, you have tofu.

01:04:28.221 --> 01:04:32.125
Yeah, I'm vegetarian,
except for when I eat fish.

01:04:33.192 --> 01:04:34.760
Oh, so you're a pescatarian.

01:04:34.793 --> 01:04:36.128
I am, too, actually.

01:04:36.161 --> 01:04:37.897
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:04:37.931 --> 01:04:39.298
How long?

01:04:39.331 --> 01:04:40.799
Since I was a kid.

01:04:40.833 --> 01:04:42.101
No way.

01:04:42.135 --> 01:04:43.103
Your parents let you?

01:04:43.135 --> 01:04:44.704
My parents wouldn't let me.

01:04:44.737 --> 01:04:46.639
I had to wait until I moved out

01:04:46.672 --> 01:04:47.875
of those meat-lovers' house.

01:04:50.610 --> 01:04:51.812
It was nice meeting you.

01:04:53.612 --> 01:04:56.048
Have you been to
Claudine's on Bailey Road?

01:04:59.652 --> 01:05:01.054
No.

01:05:01.086 --> 01:05:02.121
Is it good?

01:05:02.155 --> 01:05:03.223
Yeah, the best.

01:05:07.025 --> 01:05:08.594
What's your name?

01:05:08.628 --> 01:05:09.263
I'm Liz.

01:05:11.030 --> 01:05:11.865
You?

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:14.967
Dylan.

01:05:15.001 --> 01:05:16.670
My name's Dylan.

01:05:16.702 --> 01:05:17.304
Dylan.

01:05:20.706 --> 01:05:21.907
Yeah.

01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:23.976
So do you wanna go?

01:05:26.346 --> 01:05:27.179
Sure.

01:05:28.981 --> 01:05:31.817
How about I take your
number and I'll text you?

01:05:33.219 --> 01:05:35.088
Yeah, I don't have
a phone right now.

01:05:36.655 --> 01:05:37.990
Really?

01:05:38.023 --> 01:05:39.058
Wow.

01:05:40.293 --> 01:05:43.030
Okay.

01:05:45.797 --> 01:05:46.832
How do we do this?

01:05:47.967 --> 01:05:48.969
Dinner tomorrow night?

01:05:51.137 --> 01:05:52.172
Have we met before?

01:05:55.141 --> 01:05:57.110
No, I don't think so.

01:05:57.143 --> 01:05:58.144
Familiar face?

01:06:01.347 --> 01:06:03.717
Yeah, I guess so.

01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:04.851
Yeah, yeah.

01:06:07.353 --> 01:06:08.588
So do you wanna go?

01:06:11.324 --> 01:06:12.259
Yes.

01:06:14.059 --> 01:06:17.063
Tomorrow night,
Claudine's, seven o'clock?

01:06:17.096 --> 01:06:18.097
Yeah.

01:06:19.164 --> 01:06:20.933
Okay, yeah.

01:06:24.036 --> 01:06:24.971
That's perfect.

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:48.728
We need some cash.

01:07:21.393 --> 01:07:23.396
You don't need Mommy's
ring anymore, right?

01:07:27.766 --> 01:07:28.402
Yeah.

01:07:39.878 --> 01:07:44.150
I'm sure you will not mind
me pawning these, right?

01:07:48.855 --> 01:07:50.289
Thanks so much, Dad.

01:09:08.835 --> 01:09:10.435
Not happening.

01:09:37.095 --> 01:09:38.163
Another stroke?

01:09:41.899 --> 01:09:44.502
I'm sorry, but this is
not the best time for me.

01:09:44.537 --> 01:09:45.572
I have plans tonight.

01:09:46.939 --> 01:09:48.008
Yeah, I have a date.

01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:50.542
Yeah, a date.

01:10:00.453 --> 01:10:01.521
Remember when you were too busy

01:10:01.554 --> 01:10:03.155
to make it to my birthday party?

01:10:04.623 --> 01:10:06.225
Remember that, Dad?

01:10:23.309 --> 01:10:24.344
Just you today?

01:10:25.243 --> 01:10:27.346
No, it's gonna be two.

01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:28.215
Oh.

01:10:44.130 --> 01:10:46.466
Sorry I'm late, Dylan.

01:10:46.498 --> 01:10:50.168
I couldn't find
parking and so I found

01:10:50.202 --> 01:10:52.305
a spot in the back alley.

01:10:52.337 --> 01:10:54.239
No, no, don't worry.

01:10:54.273 --> 01:10:57.010
I actually thought you
weren't gonna come.

01:10:57.042 --> 01:10:59.211
Well, I would've
texted you, but.

01:11:02.648 --> 01:11:04.016
Yeah.

01:11:04.050 --> 01:11:05.351
Yeah, I really
gotta get a phone.

01:11:11.122 --> 01:11:12.291
So spill it.

01:11:12.324 --> 01:11:13.326
Why no cell?

01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:15.362
You're kind of an anomaly.

01:11:17.329 --> 01:11:20.033
Well, I mean, first,
I've gotta get a job.

01:11:20.065 --> 01:11:21.501
Then I can get a phone.

01:11:21.533 --> 01:11:24.069
No job, no phone.

01:11:25.537 --> 01:11:26.972
Yeah.

01:11:27.006 --> 01:11:28.375
Well
were you in jail?

01:11:33.412 --> 01:11:34.247
Yeah.

01:11:37.449 --> 01:11:38.550
Oh my God, I'm sorry.

01:11:40.987 --> 01:11:41.621
I didn't know.

01:11:51.596 --> 01:11:53.298
So do I gotta worry about you

01:11:53.332 --> 01:11:55.101
chopping me up in little pieces

01:11:55.134 --> 01:11:57.971
and eating me for
dinner?

01:11:58.003 --> 01:11:59.405
No, I don't eat
meat, remember?

01:12:00.439 --> 01:12:03.043
Ah, right.

01:12:07.012 --> 01:12:08.247
So what were you in for?

01:12:09.648 --> 01:12:12.585
It wasn't a jail,
actually, it was a hospital.

01:12:12.618 --> 01:12:15.288
I had some issues, but
I'm all better now.

01:12:17.722 --> 01:12:19.626
I was just going
through a dark time.

01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:21.694
Is that cool?

01:12:24.462 --> 01:12:26.131
Yeah, don't worry about it.

01:12:30.703 --> 01:12:31.738
I'm glad we're here.

01:12:34.105 --> 01:12:34.740
Me, too.

01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:46.318
So I told my dad I'm not a
hooker, I just dress like one.

01:12:47.819 --> 01:12:49.721
And that did not
go over very well.

01:12:49.755 --> 01:12:51.524
So you had to quit your job?

01:12:51.556 --> 01:12:53.225
Yeah, I had to.

01:12:53.259 --> 01:12:54.594
I mean, I was just
in high school,

01:12:54.627 --> 01:12:58.297
and he was threatening to
take away my college fund,

01:12:58.329 --> 01:13:01.001
so there goes the most fun
I was having in high school.

01:13:03.168 --> 01:13:05.604
Yeah, high school suked.

01:13:05.637 --> 01:13:06.472
Yeah.

01:13:07.474 --> 01:13:10.010
Those were some of the
worst years of my life.

01:13:18.451 --> 01:13:19.386
Where did you go?

01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:22.722
Chrisom High.

01:13:22.755 --> 01:13:24.623
No shit, me, too.

01:13:24.657 --> 01:13:26.226
What year did you graduate?

01:13:27.326 --> 01:13:28.461
I didn't.

01:13:28.493 --> 01:13:30.396
That was the year
I was sent away.

01:13:33.131 --> 01:13:36.368
So you were in a long time.

01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:42.175
Yeah.

01:13:48.346 --> 01:13:49.381
What happened?

01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:57.722
I had this
therapist, one of many,

01:13:57.756 --> 01:14:01.293
who told me to
keep this notebook

01:14:01.327 --> 01:14:03.463
of my deepest secrets.

01:14:03.496 --> 01:14:05.664
And then there was
this kid, this bully,

01:14:05.698 --> 01:14:08.568
he stole it from me,
and it just caused...

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:10.103
Wait a minute, wait a...

01:14:17.775 --> 01:14:18.610
Brian.

01:14:22.314 --> 01:14:23.583
Okay, Liz, I'm sorry.

01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:26.485
- Liz, I'm sorry.
- I gotta go.

01:14:26.519 --> 01:14:27.753
- I can't do this.
- We both want...

01:14:27.786 --> 01:14:29.788
You knew who I was and
you didn't say anything?

01:14:29.822 --> 01:14:30.623
I didn't wanna scare you off.

01:14:30.655 --> 01:14:31.556
Scare me off?

01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:34.527
Brian, you are fucking crazy.

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.528
Come on, Liz.

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:38.463
For the record,
everybody knew it was you

01:14:38.497 --> 01:14:40.700
who killed Blake, including me.

01:14:40.733 --> 01:14:42.301
Okay,
please, don't go.

01:14:42.333 --> 01:14:43.603
Don't you touch me!

01:14:53.945 --> 01:14:55.680
He's
just a little different.

01:14:59.585 --> 01:15:01.253
You're a good boy, Brian.

01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:03.722
You wanna get better, right?

01:15:08.527 --> 01:15:10.762
The
truth is like a knife, Brian.

01:15:10.796 --> 01:15:11.597
Trust me.

01:15:14.365 --> 01:15:15.635
You can and will.

01:15:18.570 --> 01:15:19.506
Excuse me.

01:15:19.538 --> 01:15:20.739
She doesn't like you.

01:15:20.773 --> 01:15:22.408
Leave me alone!

01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:42.561
Liz.

01:15:42.595 --> 01:15:44.262
Leave me alone.

01:15:44.296 --> 01:15:45.865
Liz, just please
let me explain, please.

01:15:45.898 --> 01:15:47.699
Explain what?

01:15:47.733 --> 01:15:48.668
- Just come on, it's not...
- I swear to God, if you

01:15:48.701 --> 01:15:51.570
take one more step, I'm
gonna call the cops.

01:15:51.604 --> 01:15:53.706
- Okay, Liz.
- Get off of me!

01:15:53.738 --> 01:15:55.841
Shh, please, shh, shh.

01:15:57.775 --> 01:15:59.811
- Please, somebody help!
- Stop!

01:15:59.845 --> 01:16:04.784
Stop.

01:16:25.604 --> 01:16:26.939
Liz.

01:16:26.971 --> 01:16:27.806
Liz.

01:16:32.478 --> 01:16:33.313
Liz.

01:16:41.720 --> 01:16:42.688
Liz.

01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:43.555
Liz, Liz.

01:16:50.695 --> 01:16:54.634
You, you sent me to all
those fucking therapists

01:16:54.667 --> 01:16:56.002
and now look at me!

01:16:58.337 --> 01:16:59.605
You did this!

01:16:59.637 --> 01:17:00.739
This isn't my fault!

01:17:06.878 --> 01:17:08.981
Now you think
about what you did.

01:17:20.725 --> 01:17:22.694
The entire basis
of my research

01:17:22.728 --> 01:17:27.300
is that children become angry
when they can't be honest,

01:17:27.332 --> 01:17:29.969
and they can't be honest if
they are on the defensive.

01:17:31.403 --> 01:17:33.338
I have time for just
one more question.

01:17:36.408 --> 01:17:39.779
Have you had any
cases where you just failed,

01:17:39.811 --> 01:17:42.681
where all this honesty
stuff just didn't work?

01:17:42.715 --> 01:17:45.784
There are no
guarantees in psychology.

01:17:45.818 --> 01:17:47.653
I've definitely had a few cases

01:17:47.685 --> 01:17:50.488
where the child wasn't
open and honest enough

01:17:50.521 --> 01:17:52.891
to fully grasp my treatment,

01:17:54.460 --> 01:17:56.762
but only when a mental
disorder stood in their way.

01:17:58.630 --> 01:17:59.832
Ever thought
that you helped someone

01:17:59.864 --> 01:18:02.068
and then it turns
out that you didn't?

01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:03.935
No, never.

01:18:11.777 --> 01:18:14.880
I'm through talking
with you idiots.

01:18:14.912 --> 01:18:17.649
Actually, I'm done putting
on that happy face.

01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:25.457
They deserve what's
coming for them.

01:18:27.626 --> 01:18:29.929
We all have to look at
ourselves in the mirror

01:18:31.130 --> 01:18:33.833
and embrace the demons
who stare back at us.

01:18:33.865 --> 01:18:36.735
So, Mr. Smith,
you say your son is dealing

01:18:36.769 --> 01:18:38.838
with some anger issues.

01:18:38.871 --> 01:18:41.841
Oh, yes, he's very disturbed.

01:18:47.512 --> 01:18:48.113
Hey.

01:19:00.525 --> 01:19:02.827
The truth is like
a knife, Dr. Lewis.

01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:04.028
It cuts through the lies!

01:19:04.061 --> 01:19:04.863
Hey!

01:19:07.666 --> 01:19:08.900
Tell me
what's been happening.

01:19:08.934 --> 01:19:11.470
Well, I mean, to
begin with, he bites.

01:19:13.805 --> 01:19:15.907
We've created
a few of those over the years.

01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:17.108
Oh really?

01:19:17.141 --> 01:19:18.577
Oh, fuck!

01:19:19.778 --> 01:19:20.813
Help, somebody!

01:19:42.134 --> 01:19:44.569
Dr. Hyland, remember me?

01:19:45.604 --> 01:19:46.704
Well, you know, I've been told

01:19:46.738 --> 01:19:48.941
exposure therapy works wonders.

01:19:53.779 --> 01:19:55.514
Oh, and a word of caution,

01:19:55.546 --> 01:19:57.949
any negative
reaction will be met

01:19:57.983 --> 01:20:01.086
with a far worse
negative reaction.

01:20:02.654 --> 01:20:03.823
He bit his sister.

01:20:05.623 --> 01:20:07.626
She's newly adopted, but I guess

01:20:07.658 --> 01:20:09.094
he's just not
adjusting too well.

01:20:10.828 --> 01:20:13.965
Sounds like a
case I had several years ago.

01:20:13.998 --> 01:20:15.067
I'd like to meet your son.

01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:16.802
I think I could help him.

01:20:16.835 --> 01:20:19.137
Oh, I'm sure you
would, Dr. Keller.

01:20:21.939 --> 01:20:23.107
How are you feeling?

01:20:25.109 --> 01:20:27.679
Stop this!

01:20:27.712 --> 01:20:29.481
How are you feeling?

01:20:29.515 --> 01:20:30.615
Are you better yet?

01:20:30.649 --> 01:20:32.918
Help, somebody!

01:20:41.859 --> 01:20:43.496
- Oh.
- Are you okay?

01:20:50.002 --> 01:20:50.803
Oh, God.

01:20:56.707 --> 01:20:57.976
Tell me something.

01:20:58.010 --> 01:21:00.813
Your case years ago,

01:21:00.845 --> 01:21:02.947
did you enjoy fucking him?

01:21:02.980 --> 01:21:05.050
Jesus, Brian.

01:21:12.123 --> 01:21:13.057
Oh God!

01:21:18.329 --> 01:21:19.864
I never grew out
of my biting phase.

01:21:22.967 --> 01:21:24.603
Am I not your type anymore?

01:21:31.208 --> 01:21:32.278
Fuck, fuck!

01:21:38.350 --> 01:21:39.952
Help, somebody!

01:22:00.738 --> 01:22:03.074
I was a
good little boy.

01:22:10.181 --> 01:22:11.082
Dad, I'm home.

01:22:22.860 --> 01:22:23.695
Dad?

01:22:38.710 --> 01:22:39.345
Dad?

01:22:59.096 --> 01:23:00.666
The electricity
went out today.

01:23:02.801 --> 01:23:04.136
When did you get home?

01:23:04.168 --> 01:23:06.104
Oh, a while ago.

01:23:08.407 --> 01:23:09.775
Where is Dad?

01:23:09.807 --> 01:23:12.211
Oh, he's in his room,
of course, you know?

01:23:14.746 --> 01:23:16.148
Sorry about all the mess.

01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:18.349
You know, it's
only been little me

01:23:18.382 --> 01:23:19.818
here taking care of him,

01:23:19.850 --> 01:23:22.787
and it's just been so
much for me to handle.

01:23:25.157 --> 01:23:27.059
What, is there a problem?

01:23:29.027 --> 01:23:29.996
I wanna see Dad.

01:23:31.128 --> 01:23:32.331
Of course, of course you do.

01:23:32.363 --> 01:23:35.067
Come on, come on,
I'll take you to him.

01:23:35.934 --> 01:23:37.369
Come on.

01:23:37.402 --> 01:23:39.137
Dad!

01:23:39.171 --> 01:23:41.173
Aubrey's here!

01:23:41.206 --> 01:23:46.045
He is gonna be so happy
that you're here to see him.

01:24:03.261 --> 01:24:05.931
Oh, Daddy, Aubrey's here.

01:24:06.931 --> 01:24:07.766
Dad?

01:24:11.802 --> 01:24:12.904
Are you okay?

01:24:16.841 --> 01:24:17.842
He has had a hard time

01:24:17.876 --> 01:24:19.177
responding since the strokes.

01:24:19.211 --> 01:24:21.113
Strokes, why didn't
anyone call me?

01:24:21.145 --> 01:24:22.280
Why didn't you call me?

01:24:24.216 --> 01:24:25.051
Dad?

01:24:27.219 --> 01:24:28.054
Dad?

01:24:35.025 --> 01:24:36.095
What did you do?

01:24:38.764 --> 01:24:40.099
You killed him!

01:24:40.966 --> 01:24:41.867
This is your fault!

01:24:56.347 --> 01:24:58.250
Why do you hate me?

01:24:58.283 --> 01:25:00.119
He loved you more.

01:25:01.353 --> 01:25:03.154
Brian?

01:25:03.188 --> 01:25:04.023
You need help.

01:25:14.865 --> 01:25:18.970
I know you think there's
no other way out right now,

01:25:19.003 --> 01:25:20.105
but there is.

01:25:24.176 --> 01:25:26.245
Give me the knife, Brian.

01:25:39.090 --> 01:25:43.060
Do you have any idea
how shit you made my life?

01:25:50.534 --> 01:25:51.369
Fuck!

01:25:55.006 --> 01:25:55.941
Fucking bitch.

01:26:55.065 --> 01:26:55.900
Brian?

01:27:17.454 --> 01:27:19.324
You are not my sister.

01:27:40.545 --> 01:27:44.015
We have a 187 and
in pursuit of a 217.

01:27:44.048 --> 01:27:47.219
Copy, copy,
backup is headed your way.

01:29:25.417 --> 01:29:26.452
Osiris?

01:29:30.688 --> 01:29:33.225
Come on in, sweetie,
it's getting late.

01:30:01.719 --> 01:30:03.555
Osiris, where are you?

01:30:07.826 --> 01:30:08.659
Silly cat.

01:30:37.555 --> 01:30:38.557
Oh, I've
definitely gotta write

01:30:38.590 --> 01:30:40.324
about this in my notebook.
