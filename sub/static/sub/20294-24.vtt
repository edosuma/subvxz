"COPS" IS FILMED ON LOCATION

00:34.200 --> 00:36.033
WITH THE MEN AND WOMEN
OF LAW ENFORCEMENT.

00:36.133 --> 00:38.600
ALL SUSPECTS ARE INNOCENT
UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY

00:38.700 --> 00:40.633
IN A COURT OF LAW.

00:41.833 --> 00:43.933
-MY UNCLE IS A POLICE OFFICER
DOWN IN MADERA,

00:44.033 --> 00:46.800
AND AT THE AGE OF 13
HE STARTED TAKING ME
ON RIDE-ALONGS.

00:46.900 --> 00:49.333
AND EVER SINCE THEN
I'VE BEEN HOOKED ON

00:49.433 --> 00:50.667
THIS IS THE JOB
THAT I WANTED TO DO.

00:50.767 --> 00:52.833
THROUGH MY TIMES OF
GOING ON RIDE-ALONGS
WITH HIM,

00:52.933 --> 00:55.033
WE HAD BEEN IN SOME
PRETTY DANGEROUS SITUATIONS
AT TIMES

00:55.133 --> 00:57.967
AND KIND OF MADE ME
SECOND GUESS IF THIS
IS WHAT I WANTED TO DO.

00:58.067 --> 01:00.100
BUT DEEP DOWN I FOUND
THAT THIS IS WHAT I WAS
MEANT TO DO,

01:00.200 --> 01:01.300
THIS IS WHAT I LOVE DOING.

01:01.400 --> 01:03.067
I'M HERE IN STOCKTON NOW
AND I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE.

01:04.067 --> 01:05.967
-HANG ON A SECOND,
THERE'S A GUY TAKING OFF
FROM US.

01:06.067 --> 01:07.267
HANG ON.

01:07.367 --> 01:09.167
-15, WE ARE.
WE'RE TRYING TO CATCH UP
TO THAT BIKE.

01:10.300 --> 01:11.733
-IT'S TAKING OFF FROM US.

01:11.833 --> 01:14.867
THE DIRT BIKE JUST RODE PAST US.
IT'S NOT STREET LEGAL.

01:14.967 --> 01:16.900
THE RIDER, HE DIDN'T
HAVE A HELMET ON.

01:17.067 --> 01:19.167
SO WE'RE GONNA TRY
TO CATCH UP TO HIM.

01:21.067 --> 01:22.933
YANKEE 16.

01:23.067 --> 01:24.533
I GOT A FAILURE TO YIELD.

01:24.633 --> 01:26.167
NORTHBOUND KELLEY DRIVE.

01:27.200 --> 01:28.700
PASSING CHARLESTON.

01:28.800 --> 01:30.867
IT'S A DIRT BIKE.

01:30.967 --> 01:33.367
LOOKS LIKE A NUMBER THREE
MALE RIDING IT.

01:33.467 --> 01:36.067
Radio:
STATUS CHANGE ACCEPTED.

01:37.333 --> 01:41.333
-IT'S A HISPANIC MALE DRIVER
ABOUT 20-25 YEARS OLD.

01:41.433 --> 01:43.733
WHITE T-SHIRT,
BLACK PANTS.

01:43.833 --> 01:45.633
WHITE SHOES.

01:47.567 --> 01:49.967
YANKEE 16,
WE'RE STILL NORTHBOUND.

01:50.067 --> 01:52.333
SPEEDS OF 40 MILES AN HOUR.

01:52.433 --> 01:54.200
PASSING STANFIELD.

01:54.300 --> 01:58.133
I THINK WE GOT ONE MORE
CRT UNIT WITH US,

01:58.233 --> 02:00.067
TWO MORE CRT UNITS
WITH US.

02:00.100 --> 02:03.500
WE'RE NOW EASTBOUND,
STANFIELD.

02:03.600 --> 02:05.500
STILL 40 MILES AN HOUR.

02:05.600 --> 02:07.467
WE'RE SOUTHBOUND...

BARNRIDGE-- BARNBRIDGE.

02:11.933 --> 02:14.067
PASSING BIXBY.

02:16.200 --> 02:19.667
THIS GUY'S ON A DIRT BIKE
TAKING OFF FROM US RIGHT NOW.

02:19.767 --> 02:24.933
AND IF THERE'S SOMEONE ON
THE OTHER SIDE, HE'S GONNA COME
THROUGH THE DIRT BIKE TRAIL.

02:25.067 --> 02:27.067
SORRY, THE, UH--

02:28.133 --> 02:30.100
HE'S CROSSING THE BRIDGE.

02:30.200 --> 02:31.933
-IS HE STILL CROSSING?

02:32.067 --> 02:33.933
DID HE CRASH?

02:34.067 --> 02:36.333
HE CRASHED, HE CRASHED!
FOOT BAIL!

02:36.433 --> 02:39.067
FOOT BAIL, FOOT BAIL!
HE'S RUNNING ACROSS
THE WATER.

02:39.100 --> 02:41.633
STOP! STOP!

02:46.333 --> 02:48.133
-(grunts)
(muffled shouting)

02:48.233 --> 02:49.933
I'M FINE, I'M FINE!

02:50.067 --> 02:52.167
(muffled shouting)

02:52.267 --> 02:53.767
-WE'RE GOOD,
WE'RE GOOD, WE'RE GOOD.

02:53.867 --> 02:55.967
-I'M A MINOR! I'M A MINOR!
-RELAX. RELAX, RELAX, RELAX.
WE GOT HIM.

02:56.067 --> 02:57.167
-I'M A MINOR!

02:57.267 --> 02:58.267
-CODE FOUR, CODE FOUR!

02:58.367 --> 02:59.400
-I'M A MINOR!
-CODE FOUR.

02:59.500 --> 03:00.833
-I GOT IT.

03:00.933 --> 03:02.933
-GAUGE 16, WE GOT HIM...
(indistinct)

03:03.067 --> 03:04.767
-CODE FOUR, K-900.

03:04.867 --> 03:06.333
-I'M A MINOR! I'M A MINOR!

03:06.433 --> 03:09.133
-NOT SMART, BUDDY.
YOU COULD HAVE KILLED YOURSELF
OR SOMEBODY ELSE.

03:10.267 --> 03:11.500
-I DON'T GOT NOTHING.

03:11.600 --> 03:13.100
-WHY YOU RUN, THEN?

03:13.200 --> 03:14.767
-(panting) I KNOW.

03:14.867 --> 03:16.500
-YOU KNOW YOU PUT EVERYBODY'S
LIFE IN DANGER, RIGHT?

03:16.600 --> 03:17.833
-YES, SIR.

03:17.933 --> 03:19.467
-IT'S ALL FUN AND GAMES
UNTIL SOMEBODY GETS HURT, RIGHT?

03:19.567 --> 03:21.233
-YOU FORGET WHAT YOU DID,
OR WHAT?

03:21.333 --> 03:22.633
-YES, SIR.

03:22.733 --> 03:24.133
-AH!
-NOT SMART, DUDE.

03:24.233 --> 03:25.400
-MY WHOLE FACE HURT.

03:25.500 --> 03:27.933
-(indistinct)
HE'S GOT EYES ON HIM.

03:28.067 --> 03:29.733
-DID HE JUST
ROLL IN THERE?
-HM?

03:29.833 --> 03:31.333
-HOW DID THAT
FENCE COME DOWN?

03:31.433 --> 03:33.800
-HE KNOCKED IT DOWN.
HE WAS TRYING TO WEDGE
HIS BIKE THROUGH THERE.

03:33.900 --> 03:36.167
IT WOULDN'T FIT.
JUST KEPT GASSING
AND KEPT GASSING IT,

03:36.267 --> 03:37.233
IT KNOCKED THE FENCE DOWN.

03:37.333 --> 03:38.733
-EVENTUALLY HE PULLED IT?

03:38.833 --> 03:40.733
-HE-- NO. THE BIKE TRYING
TO GO THROUGH THE FENCE
KNOCKED IT DOWN.

03:40.833 --> 03:41.967
-OH, OKAY.

03:42.067 --> 03:43.800
-HE HOPPED OFF, RAN AND-- YEAH.

03:43.900 --> 03:45.967
-DID YOU GUYS TACKLE HIM
OR DID HE FALL?

03:46.067 --> 03:47.700
-NO, HE STOPPED.
I CAUGHT UP TO HIM,

03:47.800 --> 03:50.067
WITHIN INCHES AND THEN HE JUST
STOPPED, GOT ON THE GROUND.

03:50.100 --> 03:52.500
(indistinct)

03:52.600 --> 03:54.200
-GOOD DEAL.
GOOD JOB.

03:54.300 --> 03:55.967
-NO PROBLEM.
THANKS.

03:56.067 --> 03:58.133
-WHAT'S GOING ON MAN,
WHY'D YOU RUN?

03:58.233 --> 03:59.367
-I WAS JUST SCARED.

03:59.467 --> 04:00.500
-SCARED FOR WHAT?

04:00.600 --> 04:03.967
-I KNOW, UH...
BIKES ARE ILLEGAL.

04:04.067 --> 04:05.433
-AND WHAT DO YOU THINK
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED?

04:05.533 --> 04:07.067
IF YOU STOPPED.

04:07.133 --> 04:08.700
-I DON'T KNOW.

04:08.800 --> 04:11.167
-MAKE YOU FEEL A LITTLE BIT
SILLY RIGHT NOW,
NOTHING WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.

04:11.267 --> 04:13.267
I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
TO GO HOME. OKAY?

04:13.367 --> 04:14.867
NOW YOU JUST STARTED
THIS WHOLE THING.

04:14.967 --> 04:16.067
YOU WERE RUNNING AROUND.

04:16.133 --> 04:17.767
YOUR BACK TIRE WAS
ABOUT TO COME OFF.

04:17.867 --> 04:19.500
-YEAH, I KNOW.
-WHAT HAPPENS IF
YOU FALL OF IT?

04:19.600 --> 04:21.100
-I WOULD HAVE PROBABLY
KILLED MYSELF.

04:21.200 --> 04:23.067
-YOU PROBABLY WOULD HAVE
KILLED YOURSELF, RIGHT?
-YES, SIR.

04:23.133 --> 04:24.333
-HOW OLD ARE YOU?
-17.

04:24.433 --> 04:26.300
-WAS ALL THIS WORTH IT?
-ALL THIS MESS?

04:26.400 --> 04:28.633
-NO, SIR.
-BECAUSE WHO DO YOU THINK'S
GONNA PAY FOR THAT FENCE?

04:29.767 --> 04:30.900
TAKE A WILD GUESS.
-ME?

04:31.067 --> 04:33.100
-YEAH. DO YOU HAVE
MONEY TO PAY FOR THAT?

04:33.200 --> 04:34.533
-NO, SIR.
-ARE YOU IN SCHOOL?

04:34.633 --> 04:35.900
-YES.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.667
-OKAY, WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOUR PROBATION OFFICER'S
GONNA DO?

04:37.767 --> 04:39.367
-OH, MY GOD.

04:39.467 --> 04:41.300
-RIGHT, YOU WERE ON PROBATION,
THEY VIOLATE YOU, AND THEN
WHERE DO YOU GO?

04:41.400 --> 04:42.567
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T BE OUT HERE.

04:42.667 --> 04:44.233
-BACK TO JAIL.
-YOU GO BACK TO JAIL, RIGHT.

04:44.333 --> 04:46.467
I SAW YOU EARLIER, PARKED.

04:46.567 --> 04:48.167
JUST CHILLING WITH YOUR FRIENDS
AND I SAW THE BIKE,

04:48.267 --> 04:49.367
AND I DIDN'T THINK
TWO THINGS OF IT.

04:49.467 --> 04:50.967
-YEAH.
-AND I SAW YOU RIDING,

04:51.067 --> 04:52.833
I WOULD HAVE JUST
STOPPED YOU AND SAID,
"HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?"

04:52.933 --> 04:54.700
YOU WOULD HAVE
TOLD ME AND I SAID,
"ALL RIGHT, GO HOME."

04:54.800 --> 04:55.933
-YEAH, I WAS GOING HOME.

04:56.067 --> 04:57.600
-ALL YOU NEEDED TO DO
WAS STOP AND TELL ME THAT.

04:57.700 --> 05:00.267
ALL RIGHT, MAN.
SIT TIGHT.

05:03.333 --> 05:04.767
WHAT'S YOUR NAME, MA'AM?

05:04.867 --> 05:07.400
-ROSALINDA.
-ROSALINDA? OKAY.

05:07.500 --> 05:09.167
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN WITH THOMAS?

05:09.267 --> 05:10.433
-THREE YEARS.
-THREE YEARS?

05:10.533 --> 05:12.067
AND THIS IS YOUR FIRST KID?
OKAY.

05:12.167 --> 05:14.067
HAS HE DONE ANY OF THIS BEFORE?

05:14.133 --> 05:16.600
-NO.
-YOU EVER TOLD HIM
NOT TO RIDE HIS BIKE AROUND?

05:16.700 --> 05:18.167
-I TRIED.
-AND WHAT?

05:18.267 --> 05:20.700
-HE DOESN'T LISTEN TO ME.
HE DOESN'T LISTEN TO ANYBODY.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.700
-WHAT DOES HE SAY?

05:22.800 --> 05:25.100
-I DON'T REALLY-- I DON'T TRY
TO TELL HIM WHAT TO DO

05:25.200 --> 05:27.433
'CAUSE HE'S HIS OWN PERSON.

05:27.533 --> 05:28.867
-HE'S HIS OWN PERSON?
-I CAN'T.

05:28.967 --> 05:30.333
-COME ON.

05:32.533 --> 05:33.833
EXCUSE ME.

05:33.933 --> 05:35.367
THOMAS,

05:35.467 --> 05:37.133
WHY DON'T YOU TALK TO
ROSALINDA, MAN.

05:37.233 --> 05:38.900
YOU JUST SIT THERE.
COME HERE.

05:39.067 --> 05:41.200
-WHAT'S WRONG, BABE?
-LOOK WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO HER?

05:41.300 --> 05:43.067
-WHAT'S WRONG?

05:43.133 --> 05:45.067
WHY YOU CRYING?

05:45.100 --> 05:47.133
STOP CRYING.

05:47.233 --> 05:49.367
LOOK, YOU GOT HER
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.

05:49.467 --> 05:51.433
YOU GOT TO BE STRONG
FOR HER.

05:52.900 --> 05:54.933
-IF IT'S TOO HARD FOR YOU,
ROSALINDA, YOU CAN GO BACK.

05:55.067 --> 05:56.900
-YOU GOT TO REMEMBER
THESE TWO FACES, MAN,

05:57.067 --> 05:58.567
NEXT TIME YOU TRY
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

05:58.667 --> 06:00.367
SERIOUSLY, IT'S NOT FUNNY, DUDE.

06:01.433 --> 06:03.233
YOU COULD HAVE GOT HURT
AND YOU GOT TO REMEMBER

06:03.333 --> 06:05.167
WHAT'S ON THE LINE HERE.

06:05.267 --> 06:08.333
EVEN IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT
EVERYBODY ELSE THAT'S ON
THE STREETS OF STOCKTON,

06:08.433 --> 06:10.167
YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT US
THAT'S CHASING YOU,

06:10.267 --> 06:11.500
YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT YOURSELF,

06:11.600 --> 06:13.067
THINK ABOUT THESE TWO.

06:14.333 --> 06:16.267
-SHE CAN'T EVEN SAY ANYTHING
TO YOU, SHE'S SO UPSET.

06:16.367 --> 06:17.833
DOES THAT MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

06:17.933 --> 06:19.700
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU HAVE THAT SMIRK
ON YOUR FACE.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.433
-FAMILY MEANS THE WORLD
TO ME, MAN.

06:21.533 --> 06:24.233
-LOOK AT THIS FACE HERE.
SHE HAS NO CHOICE
IN THE WORLD.

06:24.333 --> 06:26.867
AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IF
SHE GROWS UP WITHOUT A DAD?

06:26.967 --> 06:29.500
FOR YOUR SILLY MISTAKE
OF YOU THINKING

06:29.600 --> 06:31.733
THAT YOU'RE GONNA GET
IN SOME BIG TROUBLE.
YOU DECIDED TO RUN.

06:33.833 --> 06:35.667
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT
YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO FIGURE OUT

06:35.767 --> 06:37.833
BECAUSE YOU'RE ALMOST 18
AND YOU'VE GOT TO LEARN
HOW TO BE A MAN.

06:37.933 --> 06:39.367
YOU UNDERSTAND?

06:39.467 --> 06:40.967
THIS PERSON CARES
ABOUT YOU

06:41.067 --> 06:42.433
AND LOOK AT WHAT
YOU'RE DOING TO HER.

06:42.533 --> 06:44.233
SO THIS IS WHAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN.

06:44.333 --> 06:46.133
YOU'RE GONNA BE
CITED TO YOUR MOM
TODAY, OKAY?

06:46.233 --> 06:47.900
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU
TO FORGET THE FACT

06:48.067 --> 06:49.333
THAT YOU CAN GO TO JAIL.

06:49.433 --> 06:51.300
WE'RE CHOOSING NOT TO.
WE'RE GONNA BE EASY
ON YOU TODAY.

06:51.400 --> 06:53.133
-WOULDN'T HAVE TAKEN MUCH
FOR YOU TO CRASH,

06:53.233 --> 06:54.567
HIT YOUR HEAD, AND YOU'D
HAVE BEEN GONE.

06:54.667 --> 06:56.333
SHE WOULD HAVE GROWN UP
NEVER KNOWING DADDY.

06:56.433 --> 06:58.667
-I HOPE THAT YOU
TAKE THIS AS A LESSON.

06:58.767 --> 07:00.067
-PFFT, I WILL.
-YOU UNDERSTAND?

07:00.100 --> 07:01.267
-YES, SIR.

07:01.367 --> 07:02.667
-DON'T LET THIS
HAPPEN AGAIN, MAN.

07:02.767 --> 07:03.867
-OH, I WON'T.

07:03.967 --> 07:05.867
-SERIOUSLY, TAKE THIS
AS YOUR LUCKY DAY, MAN.

07:05.967 --> 07:07.067
-TRUST ME.

07:07.133 --> 07:08.400
-SO I EXPECT YOU
TO GO TO COURT

07:08.500 --> 07:10.267
AND THEN WHO KNOWS WHAT
THE JUDGE IS GONNA MAKE YOU DO.

07:10.367 --> 07:12.300
BUT YOU BETTER HOPE
THE JUDGE IS JUST
AS NICE AS WE ARE.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.400
-YOU THINK ABOUT ALL
THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CALLS

07:16.500 --> 07:18.900
AT THE END OF DAY,
WHAT REALLY MATTERED TO YOU.

07:19.067 --> 07:21.467
WHEN YOU GET INTO IT,
YOU THINK IT'S ALL ABOUT

07:21.567 --> 07:24.167
JUST CHASING THE BAD GUY
AND GETTING THE BAD GUY.

07:24.267 --> 07:26.300
THAT'S REALLY KIND OF
THE SMALL PART OF IT.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.567
THE PART THAT SEEMS TO
STICK WITH YOU IS WHEN

07:28.667 --> 07:30.833
YOU KNOW THAT YOU'VE HELPED
SOMEBODY AND THAT

07:30.933 --> 07:33.833
YOU MADE A DIFFERENCE
IN YOUR COMMUNITY SOMEHOW

07:33.933 --> 07:36.067
DOING SOMETHING GOOD
FOR SOMEBODY ELSE.

07:37.433 --> 07:39.233
WE'RE HEADED TO A
WELFARE CHECK.

07:39.333 --> 07:41.967
ONE OF THE NEIGHBORS WHO
WISHED TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS

07:42.067 --> 07:45.733
HAS CALLED AND SAID THAT
THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON
HERE AT THE HOUSE

07:45.833 --> 07:47.133
WHERE SOMEBODY'S YELLED.

07:47.233 --> 07:49.533
THEY THINK THEY'RE
IN DISTRESS OF SOME SORT.

07:49.633 --> 07:53.967
AND THEY CAN SMELL A HEAVY
PRESENCE OF MARIJUANA.

07:54.067 --> 07:55.967
(radio chatter)

08:00.667 --> 08:01.967
(whispers) PIPE.

08:02.067 --> 08:04.133
THE GUY HAS A PIPE RIGHT THERE.

08:04.233 --> 08:05.767
THEY'RE DOING METH.

08:05.867 --> 08:07.200
IT'S A METH PIPE.

08:07.300 --> 08:08.700
IT'S A METH PIPE.

08:08.800 --> 08:11.667
THERE'S LIKE FOUR PEOPLE.
IT'S A METH PIPE
THEY'RE SMOKING.

08:11.767 --> 08:13.333
DO WE WANT TO GET--

08:13.433 --> 08:16.267
SOMEBODY BANG ON THE WINDOW,
SOMEBODY BANG ON THE DOOR.
WE'LL WAIT HERE.

08:18.100 --> 08:21.067
(shouting)
BOISE POLICE, STOP!
DON'T MOVE!

08:21.133 --> 08:22.400
DON'T MOVE, GET ON THE GROUND!

08:22.500 --> 08:23.867
-I DIDN'T EVEN DO--
-GET ON THE GROUND, NOW!

08:23.967 --> 08:25.867
-OKAY. OKAY.

08:25.967 --> 08:28.400
-LAY DOWN. ALL THE WAY DOWN.
ALL THE WAY DOWN.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.133
ALL THE WAY DOWN.

08:30.233 --> 08:31.733
-WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:31.833 --> 08:33.233
-OFFICERS, CAN I KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:33.333 --> 08:35.400
-PUT YOUR HANDS BEHIND
YOUR BACK. PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

08:35.500 --> 08:37.333
I KNOW YOU, DAVID.

08:37.433 --> 08:39.067
YEAH, I JUST SAW
WHAT YOU WERE
DOING IN THERE.

08:39.133 --> 08:41.633
-SMOKING SOME BUD?
-NO, THAT WASN'T BUD.

08:41.733 --> 08:43.067
-(handcuffs close)

08:43.167 --> 08:44.367
-YEAH.

08:44.467 --> 08:46.633
-WHO ELSE IS IN THERE?
-(indistinct chatter)

08:46.733 --> 08:49.067
-IT'S JUST MY SON
IN MY ROOM.

08:49.133 --> 08:51.667
-'KAY. GO AHEAD AND STAND--
LEAN UP AGAINST YOUR CAR
FOR ME, OKAY?

08:51.767 --> 08:52.933
-(mumbles)

08:53.067 --> 08:54.400
-YEP.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.333
EVERYBODY, STEP ON OUT.

08:56.433 --> 08:57.533
LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS.

08:57.633 --> 08:58.833
-WE HAVE BUD RIGHT THERE.
-YEAH.

08:58.933 --> 09:00.167
-Both:
COME ON OUT.

09:00.267 --> 09:01.300
-OKAY.

09:01.400 --> 09:03.733
-LET'S GO.
WHO ELSE IS INSIDE?

09:03.833 --> 09:05.467
POLICE! ANYBODY ELSE
INSIDE THE HOUSE?

09:05.567 --> 09:06.767
-STOP RIGHT THERE.
STOP RIGHT THERE.

09:06.867 --> 09:08.533
TURN AND FACE THE WALL.
FACE THE WALL.

09:08.633 --> 09:10.067
-YEP.
-SPREAD YOUR FEET.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.333
BRASS KNUCKLES?

09:12.433 --> 09:14.067
-THEY'RE BELT BUCKLES.

09:14.167 --> 09:16.600
-OKAY. SINCE YOU GOT WEAPONS,
I'M JUST GONNA PUT YOU
IN HANDCUFFS FOR NOW.

09:16.700 --> 09:18.067
OKAY?
-OH.

09:18.133 --> 09:21.533
HE'S NOT GONNA HURT NOBODY.
HE JUST HAS THAT SO...

09:21.633 --> 09:24.533
UH, WE DON'T HAVE TO GO TO WAR.
-OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

09:24.633 --> 09:26.367
GO TO WAR, HUH?
WHO WE GOING TO WAR WITH?

09:26.467 --> 09:28.833
-WITH THE MILITIA.
-WITH THE MILITIA?

09:28.933 --> 09:30.400
-YEAH.

09:30.500 --> 09:31.967
-I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

09:32.067 --> 09:35.400
-YOU KNOW THOSE GUYS THAT ARE
TRYING TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD?

09:35.500 --> 09:37.933
-SO YOU'RE GONNA STOP THEM
WITH SOME BRASS KNUCKLES?

09:38.067 --> 09:42.233
-NO, BUT WE'RE GONNA
PROTECT OURSELVES WITH
THE BRASS KNUCKLES.

09:42.333 --> 09:43.867
-WHY ARE YOU POSSESSING
THIS KIND OF STUFF?

09:43.967 --> 09:45.533
YOU THINK YOUR PROBATION
OFFICER'S GONNA SAY,

09:45.633 --> 09:47.833
YEAH, THEY LIKE YOU HAVING
CONCEALED KNIVES LIKE THAT?

09:47.933 --> 09:50.733
IS THIS YOUR HOUSE, MA'AM?
-YES, IT IS.

09:50.833 --> 09:52.800
-LET ME TELL YOU
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE
AND WHY WE'RE HERE.

09:52.900 --> 09:54.433
SO WE GET A CALL HERE--

09:54.533 --> 09:56.167
UM, SOMEBODY WAS
CONCERNED ABOUT--

09:56.267 --> 09:57.867
THEY HEARD SOMEBODY YELL,
THEY THOUGHT THEY--

09:57.967 --> 09:59.400
MAYBE SOMEBODY WAS
IN NEED OF SOME HELP.

09:59.500 --> 10:00.600
-OH.

10:00.700 --> 10:02.300
-SO WE COME HERE, NATURALLY,
TO CHECK THAT OUT

10:02.400 --> 10:03.800
AND MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

10:03.900 --> 10:06.467
I WALKED TO THIS WINDOW HERE
WHERE I SEE PEOPLE
MOVING AROUND,

10:06.567 --> 10:08.533
I LOOK IN AND WHAT DO I SEE?

10:08.633 --> 10:11.167
LET'S NOT PLAY DUMB.
JUST TELL ME WHAT I SAW.

10:11.267 --> 10:14.967
'CAUSE I CAN WORK WITH PEOPLE
THAT WORK WITH ME A LOT BETTER
THAN THOSE THAT DON'T.

10:15.067 --> 10:17.667
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
I SAW THROUGH THE WINDOW?

10:17.767 --> 10:19.067
-I DON'T KNOW.

10:19.167 --> 10:20.333
-OH, COME ON.
-US SMOKING.

10:20.433 --> 10:22.300
-YEAH, OKAY, THANK YOU.
WHAT WERE WE SMOKING?

10:23.600 --> 10:25.800
DAVID ALREADY WAS HONEST,
WHY DON'T YOU BE HONEST.

10:25.900 --> 10:27.333
-METH.
-'KAY.

10:27.433 --> 10:29.033
COME ON UP HERE.

10:29.133 --> 10:31.300
LET'S HAVE YOU WAIT
RIGHT HERE FOR ME.
LAURIE, COME ON IN HERE.

10:31.400 --> 10:32.900
-YES, SIR.
-ARE YOU ON PROBATION, LAURIE?

10:33.000 --> 10:34.333
-NO, SIR.
-YOU'RE NOT?

10:34.433 --> 10:36.233
-OKAY. JUST, JUST COME
RIGHT OVER HERE.

10:36.333 --> 10:39.333
I'M NOT GONNA THROW YOU DOWN
OR ANYTHING, JUST COME OVER HERE
AND BE COOPERATIVE FOR ME.

10:39.433 --> 10:40.833
-OKAY.
-'KAY?

10:40.933 --> 10:42.633
JUST SIT RIGHT THERE UNTIL
MY PARTNER COMES BACK.

10:42.733 --> 10:44.033
-OKAY.

10:44.133 --> 10:45.833
-SO WHAT AM I GONNA FIND?
YOU TOLD ME THERE'S GONNA
BE METH

10:45.933 --> 10:48.433
AND WE SAW YOU SMOKING IT.
THERE'S OBVIOUSLY SOME WEED
RIGHT HERE.

10:48.533 --> 10:50.967
LET'S JUST GET IT ALL
OUT AT ONCE

10:51.067 --> 10:54.400
BECAUSE THIS ISN'T GOOD,
FIRST OF ALL, FOR JUSTIN,

10:54.500 --> 10:56.567
WHO'S ON PROBATION,
TO EVEN BE AROUND THIS STUFF.

10:56.667 --> 10:58.400
HOW MUCH DID YOU GUYS
SMOKE UP TONIGHT?

10:58.500 --> 11:01.133
-UM, WE JUST STARTED.

11:01.233 --> 11:04.400
YOU JUST, JUST HIT THAT PIPE
WHEN WE WALKED UP?
-JUST RECENTLY.

11:04.500 --> 11:06.133
-AND YOU'RE FEELING
THE EFFECTS OF IT RIGHT NOW?

11:06.233 --> 11:07.967
-NO.

11:08.067 --> 11:12.433
-'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW YOU,
BUT YOU SEEM TO SPEAK WITH
A THICK TONGUE AS YOU TALK.

11:12.533 --> 11:13.933
KIND OF SLOW SPEECH.

11:14.067 --> 11:15.100
-THICK TONGUE?
-YEAH.

11:15.200 --> 11:16.433
-OH, I PROBABLY DO.

11:16.533 --> 11:19.333
-OKAY, LAURIE'S GONNA TAKE US
THROUGH THE HOUSE,

11:19.433 --> 11:21.533
POINT OUT WHERE EVERYTHING'S AT,
WE'LL COLLECT IT.

11:21.633 --> 11:24.067
I'M OUT OF GLOVES,
UNLESS YOU GOT SOME,
I CAN GRAB THEM.

11:24.133 --> 11:25.867
LAURIE, STAND UP.

11:25.967 --> 11:27.733
LET'S GO BACK HERE.

11:29.400 --> 11:31.200
JUST POINT WHERE IT'S AT,
DON'T TOUCH IT.

11:31.300 --> 11:32.467
-OKAY.

11:32.567 --> 11:34.067
-'CAUSE WE'RE--
THIS IS WHERE THE PARTY IS AT.

11:34.100 --> 11:35.567
-YES. YEP.

11:35.667 --> 11:38.067
-'KAY. THERE'S ANOTHER PIPE.

11:38.167 --> 11:40.133
WHAT'S GONNA BE IN HERE?

11:40.233 --> 11:41.633
-ROACHES.

11:41.733 --> 11:43.900
-ROACHES? OKAY.
-THE DOPE'S INSIDE OF THE BIBLE.

11:44.067 --> 11:45.800
-OKAY, CAN YOU STAND
RIGHT OVER HERE FOR ME LAURIE?

11:46.700 --> 11:48.067
YOU HAVE DOPE
IN THE BIBLE?

11:48.167 --> 11:49.400
-YEAH.

11:54.333 --> 11:55.667
-WHERE AM I GONNA FIND THIS?

11:55.767 --> 11:57.267
-IT'S MARKED HERE.
-BOOK OF JOHN?

11:57.367 --> 11:58.933
-I DON'T KNOW.

11:59.067 --> 12:01.667
-'CAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE
WE'RE IN THE BOOK OF JOHN.

12:01.767 --> 12:04.467
-NO? WHAT IS IT
THAT'S IN HERE?

12:04.567 --> 12:06.700
-THE METH?
-YEAH.

12:07.900 --> 12:09.667
IT'S A DOLLAR BILL.

12:09.767 --> 12:11.700
-THERE YOU GO.

12:14.133 --> 12:15.567
-(camera shutter clicks)
-'KAY.

12:20.667 --> 12:22.900
-IS IT LOOSE IN THERE
OR IS IT WRAPPED IN PLASTIC?

12:23.067 --> 12:24.367
-IT'S LOOSE.

12:27.733 --> 12:30.500
-SO IS THIS ALL OF IT?
OTHER THAN WHAT'S OUT THERE?

12:30.600 --> 12:33.233
-YES. DO YOU HAVE
THE MARIJUANA PIPE TOO?

12:33.333 --> 12:34.833
-YEP.
-OH, THERE'S MORE.

12:34.933 --> 12:36.933
-YOU HAVE MORE IN THERE?
OH, ON THE GLASS.

12:37.067 --> 12:39.333
WHO'S THE PICTURE OF THIS?
WHO'S THAT PERSON?

12:39.433 --> 12:40.433
-ME.

12:40.533 --> 12:42.067
-THAT'S YOU?
-YEAH.

12:42.100 --> 12:43.633
-YOU DON'T DO METH OFF YOURSELF.

12:43.733 --> 12:45.067
THAT'S KIND OF WEIRD.

12:45.100 --> 12:46.600
THAT'S YOU AS A KID.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.667
DON'T YOU REMEMBER YOURSELF
AS BEING A GOOD KID?

12:48.767 --> 12:50.067
-YEAH.

12:50.167 --> 12:52.067
-THAT'S WEIRD.

12:52.100 --> 12:53.667
NO?

12:54.800 --> 12:56.133
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO
BACK OUTSIDE, LAURIE.

12:56.233 --> 12:58.233
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP,
EVERYBODY.

12:58.333 --> 12:59.667
I NEED YOUR ATTENTION.

12:59.767 --> 13:01.700
WE ALREADY KNOW,
BECAUSE WE LOOKED
THROUGH THE WINDOW--

13:01.800 --> 13:03.333
HERE'S HOW THIS
IS GONNA GO DOWN.

13:03.433 --> 13:05.867
YOU GUYS ARE POSSESSING
FELONY SUBSTANCE.

13:05.967 --> 13:08.633
JUSTIN'S ALREADY COME CLEAN.
YOU'VE COME CLEAN.

13:08.733 --> 13:11.433
-YES.
-'KAY, DAVID, TELL ME WHAT
YOU'VE BEEN SMOKING TONIGHT.

13:11.533 --> 13:13.900
-OH, TONIGHT? JUST A LITTLE
BIT OF BUD, A LITTLE BIT OF--

13:14.067 --> 13:15.267
-LITTLE BIT OF METH?
-YEAH.

13:15.367 --> 13:16.667
-THANK YOU.

13:16.767 --> 13:18.367
-YOUNG LADY.
-DON'T DO THAT.

13:18.467 --> 13:21.200
-(chuckles) I WASN'T
SMOKING ANYTHING.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.067
-I CAN HONESTLY
VOUCH FOR THAT, SIR.

13:23.133 --> 13:24.233
-I DON'T DO IT.

13:24.333 --> 13:25.833
-WE'RE IN A PLACE WHERE
DRUGS ARE USED,

13:25.933 --> 13:27.200
WHICH IS ILLEGAL
IN ITSELF.

13:27.300 --> 13:28.467
-ARE WE GETTING--
-SAME THING.

13:28.567 --> 13:30.700
-WHICH IS... (mumbles)

13:30.800 --> 13:32.467
EVERYBODY'S GONNA GET
THE PARAPHANELIA,

13:32.567 --> 13:34.167
POSSESSION OF MARIJUANA,

13:34.267 --> 13:36.800
POSSESSION OF CONTROLLED
SUBSTANCE FELONY WHICH
IS THE METH.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.867
EXCEPT HER, SHE'S GONNA
HAVE ONE MISDEMEANOR.

13:38.967 --> 13:40.433
DON'T DO DRUGS, GUYS.

13:43.067 --> 13:45.433
-I MOVED TO LAS VEGAS IN 2001

13:45.533 --> 13:47.867
ABOUT TWO WEEKS BEFORE
THE ACADEMY STARTED.

13:47.967 --> 13:50.133
AT BOLDEN, WE HAVE A SAYING.
"BOLDEN PRIDE."

13:50.233 --> 13:52.800
AND I REALLY GOT TO KNOW
WHAT IT WAS ABOUT.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.833
JUST LIKE THE LION FAMILY PRIDE,

13:54.933 --> 13:57.200
WE TREAT EACH OTHER
LIKE FAMILY. WE LOOK
AFTER EACH OTHER.

13:57.300 --> 14:01.200
AND WE TAKE, YOU KNOW,
VIOLENT CRIMES SERIOUS.

14:01.300 --> 14:06.067
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT IT
TO AFFECT THE RESIDENTS
THAT LIVE IN OUR AREA.

14:06.167 --> 14:07.533
-(radio chatter)

14:07.633 --> 14:10.967
-WE JUST GOT A VICTIM,
CALLED IN, SAYING THAT
HE WAS A...

14:11.067 --> 14:14.833
ATTEMPT ROBBERY AT THE
BANK OF AMERICA ATM.

14:14.933 --> 14:17.067
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH
INFORMATION NOW.

14:17.167 --> 14:19.433
IT'S JUST A BLACK MALE
WITH A GUN,

14:19.533 --> 14:20.967
WEARING A LETTERMAN JACKET.

14:22.267 --> 14:24.133
OKAY, HE'S RUNNING NORTHBOUND.

14:24.233 --> 14:27.067
WE'RE JUST GONNA GO DOWN
TO THE CORNER AND CUT HIM
OFF ON MLK.

14:27.133 --> 14:30.700
-(radio chatter)

14:30.800 --> 14:32.867
-OH, THEY GOT HIM AT GUNPOINT.

14:34.700 --> 14:36.633
-Man:
GO SECURE MY CAR!

14:39.267 --> 14:41.467
THEY NEED TO FIND OUT
WHERE THEIR NPR IS.

14:41.567 --> 14:43.433
-GO SECURE MY CAR!

14:43.533 --> 14:45.333
-ON N, GO SECURE MY CAR!

14:48.367 --> 14:49.800
-I NEED AN ARTICLE CHECK.

14:49.900 --> 14:51.267
-OKAY.
-YEAH, YEAH.

14:51.367 --> 14:53.167
-ALONG THE SIDE OF
THE VAST BUSINESS RIGHT THERE.

14:53.267 --> 14:55.633
ONE PERSON WILL BE
RUNNING FROM THE BANK.
-HE'S IN CUSTODY.

14:55.733 --> 14:57.300
-WHAT DID I DO?

14:57.400 --> 14:58.900
-YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID.

14:59.867 --> 15:01.833
-413 A, BEHIND YOU, A.

15:01.933 --> 15:03.867
OKAY.

15:03.967 --> 15:05.700
-HEY, SARGE, SO
WHAT WAS IT THAT
YOU GUYS SAW?

15:05.800 --> 15:08.967
-SO A CALL CAME OUT OVER HERE
SAYING THAT AN INDIVIDUAL
WAS AT THE ATM

15:09.067 --> 15:10.800
AND THAT SOMEBODY WAS
TRYING TO ROB HIM.

15:10.900 --> 15:13.900
HE DESCRIBED HIM AS A BLACK MALE
WEARING A LETTERMAN-TYPE JACKET.

15:14.067 --> 15:15.733
SO WE WERE JUST DOWN THE STREET.

15:15.833 --> 15:18.967
SO WE TURNED NORTH ON N STREET,
WHICH IS RIGHT BEHIND THE
BANK OF AMERICA.

15:19.067 --> 15:21.900
AS WE WERE COMING UP,
THERE WAS A B.M. WITH
A LETTERMAN JACKET ON,

15:22.067 --> 15:23.933
WALKING NORTHBOUND
ON THE SIDEWALK.

15:24.067 --> 15:25.767
SO WE RAN OUT
TO STOP HIM

15:25.867 --> 15:27.500
AND AS SOON AS
WE IDENTIFIED OURSELVES,

15:27.600 --> 15:29.600
HE TOOK OFF RUNNING.
HE'S HOLDING HIS WAISTBAND
THE WHOLE TIME.

15:29.700 --> 15:31.333
-RIGHT.
-WHEN HE GETS BACK THERE
IN THE LITTLE ALLEY,

15:31.433 --> 15:33.233
HE ACTUALLY TOSSES THE GUN.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.867
AND THEN HE SHOOTS OUT HERE
WHILE I WAS COMING AROUND
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BUILDING.

15:35.967 --> 15:38.500
SO PRETTY MUCH RAN INTO
EACH OTHER IN THE MIDDLE OF MLK.

15:38.600 --> 15:41.533
AND THEN I PRONED HIM OUT
AND WE TOOK HIM INTO CUSTODY
OVER HERE.

15:41.633 --> 15:42.900
-OKAY. GOOD JOB.

15:43.067 --> 15:44.700
-THANKS, MAN.
-GOOD JOB.

15:44.800 --> 15:46.267
-NEXT TIME,
DON'T RUN.

15:46.367 --> 15:48.567
-YOU KNOW HOW MANY BLACK PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN GETTING KILLED
BY COPS, DUDE?

15:48.667 --> 15:50.067
-HOW MANY?
-WITH THEIR HANDS UP.

15:50.100 --> 15:51.367
ABOUT 15 RIGHT NOW.

15:51.467 --> 15:53.067
-RIGHT HERE IN VEGAS?

15:53.100 --> 15:54.867
-IF YOU DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG, YOU SHOULDN'T
RUN FROM THE POLICE.

15:54.967 --> 15:57.600
IF YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG
AND YOU'RE INNOCENT, YOU DON'T
RUN FROM THE POLICE.

15:57.700 --> 16:00.200
-I WATCHED THERE,
AND SEE A MAN ON YOUTUBE,

16:00.300 --> 16:01.867
SIT THERE, PUT HIS HANDS UP,
AND GET SHOT.

16:01.967 --> 16:04.133
-WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
SOMEONE GOT SHOT AND KILLED
ON THE WEST SIDE?

16:04.233 --> 16:05.733
-Both:
BY THE POLICE.

16:05.833 --> 16:07.067
-NAME IT.
-GO AHEAD.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.233
-I'M NOT SURE.

16:08.333 --> 16:10.100
-2006. THAT WAS NINE YEARS AGO.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.967
SO DON'T SIT HERE AND TELL ME
IT'S SOME KIND OF EPIDEMIC.

16:13.067 --> 16:14.333
ALL RIGHT?

16:15.633 --> 16:17.333
-IF YOU WANT TO BELIEVE
THAT STUFF, YOU CAN.

16:17.433 --> 16:19.900
-WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN DO
TO TREAT PEOPLE WITH
DIGNITY AND RESPECT OVER HERE,

16:20.067 --> 16:22.867
AND YOU RUNNING FROM US PUTS
YOUR LIFE IN DANGER AND IT PUTS
OUR LIVES IN DANGER.

16:22.967 --> 16:25.067
NEXT TIME YOU SEE THE POLICE,
THEY ASK YOU TO STOP,

16:25.167 --> 16:26.267
DON'T RUN. JUST STOP.

16:26.367 --> 16:27.733
-I WILL SIT THERE. YEAH.

16:27.833 --> 16:29.233
-WELL, DO YOU SEE
WHERE IT GOT YOU?

16:29.333 --> 16:30.400
-YEAH.
-OKAY.

16:30.500 --> 16:31.900
DID YOU LEARN YOUR LESSON?

16:32.067 --> 16:33.467
-YEAH.
-I HOPE YOU DID.
THANK YOU.

16:33.567 --> 16:35.533
I APOLOGIZE, MAN. MY BAD.

16:35.633 --> 16:37.300
-ALL RIGHT, MAN,
WE'RE GONNA HAVE YOU STAND UP.

16:37.400 --> 16:38.900
-AH! AH!
MY LEGS.

16:39.067 --> 16:40.333
-WHAT ABOUT THEM?
-KINDA GOING TO SLEEP.

16:40.433 --> 16:41.933
-WELL, THEY'RE TIRED
'CAUSE YOU RAN.

16:42.067 --> 16:43.367
OBVIOUSLY, YOU DIDN'T
STRETCH, RIGHT?

16:43.467 --> 16:46.800
RIGHT NOW WE'RE BRINGING
THE VICTIM OVER FOR A SHOW-UP,

16:46.900 --> 16:49.267
SEE IF THEY CONFIRM THIS IS
THE SUSPECT OR NOT.

16:49.367 --> 16:50.833
-SOUTHBOUND TO NORTHBOUND?

16:50.933 --> 16:53.400
-NO, THEY'RE GONNA BE COMING
FROM NORTHBOUND TO SOUTHBOUND.

16:53.500 --> 16:55.933
SO YOU WANT TO PUT HIM OVER
IN MY CAR INSTEAD OF
STANDING OUT HERE?

16:56.067 --> 16:57.733
-YEAH, AND THEN WE JUST
BRING HIM--

16:57.833 --> 16:59.400
WE'LL PULL HIM ACROSS.

17:00.600 --> 17:03.133
HEY, SARGE, I'M GONNA
PULL HIM OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE.

17:03.233 --> 17:06.067
IF YOU WANT TO LIGHT
HIM UP HERE.
STAND RIGHT HERE.

17:06.100 --> 17:07.633
FACE NORTHBOUND.

17:07.733 --> 17:09.767
-COME ON, DOES HE
HAVE TO PUT THAT LIGHT ON ME.

17:09.867 --> 17:11.667
-YEAH. JUST LOOK STRAIGHT AHEAD.

17:11.767 --> 17:13.933
-DUDE, I CAN'T SEE.
IT'S TOO BRIGHT.

17:14.067 --> 17:16.067
-LOOK STRAIGHT AHEAD.
-YOU LOOK INTO IT.

17:16.100 --> 17:17.800
-LOOK UP.

17:17.900 --> 17:19.867
-I DID EVERYTHING YOU
ASKED ME TO DO.

17:19.967 --> 17:21.567
-(radio chatter)

17:23.733 --> 17:25.433
-FACE THE CAR.

17:25.533 --> 17:26.500
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

17:26.600 --> 17:28.133
-YEAH.

17:29.333 --> 17:34.067
-OKAY. THE VICTIM IDENTIFIED
THE SUSPECT AS THE PERSON
ROBBING HIM AT GUNPOINT.

17:34.167 --> 17:37.067
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE UNITS
TRYING TO LOCATE THAT WEAPON.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.700
KLINKO'S UNITS
SAW HIM TOSS IT.

17:39.800 --> 17:42.400
SEE THE SERIAL NUMBER HAS BEEN
COMPLETELY SCRATCHED OFF.

17:42.500 --> 17:44.100
-YEAH.

17:44.200 --> 17:46.967
-C.S.I.'S GONNA COME PICK UP
THE GUN. THAT'LL BE TESTED.

17:47.067 --> 17:49.867
SEE IF THE GUN'S
REPORTED STOLEN.

17:49.967 --> 17:52.200
-PROBABLY DO DNA BUCCAL SWAB
ON HIM AND THE GUN.

17:52.300 --> 17:54.133
-AFTER THAT, HE'S JUST GONNA
MEET UP WITH DETECTIVES.

17:54.233 --> 17:56.467
TELL HIS SIDE OF THE STORY,
IF THERE'S ANY.

17:56.567 --> 17:57.900
AND HE'LL BE BOOKED.

17:58.067 --> 17:59.867
SO TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED, MAN.

18:00.067 --> 18:01.267
WHY'D YOU RUN?

18:01.367 --> 18:02.933
-WHY DO YOU THINK?

18:04.267 --> 18:06.933
I HAD SOMETHING ON ME
THAT SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN THERE.

18:07.067 --> 18:09.067
-OKAY.
-AND I DIDN'T WANT
TO GET CAUGHT WITH IT.

18:09.167 --> 18:10.467
IT'S SIMPLE AS THAT.

18:10.567 --> 18:12.600
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT--

18:12.700 --> 18:14.800
I MEAN, MOST GUYS,

18:14.900 --> 18:16.933
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN,
(bleep) GANGS,

18:17.067 --> 18:19.333
THEY COMFORTABLE WITH
GETTING CAUGHT WITH IT,
THEY DON'T CARE.

18:19.433 --> 18:22.233
THEY'LL, YOU KNOW,
TAKE THAT ROUTE.
NO, NOT ME.

18:22.333 --> 18:26.233
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT
I TRY TO LIVE MY LIFE BY.

18:26.333 --> 18:27.700
MM-HMM.

18:27.800 --> 18:31.633
-SO, YES, I WAS GONNA
TRY EVERYTHING POSSIBLE
TO GET AWAY.

18:31.733 --> 18:33.500
-TO SEPERATE YOURSELF
FROM THAT ITEM.

18:33.600 --> 18:34.833
-YES.

18:34.933 --> 18:37.367
'CAUSE IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT

18:37.467 --> 18:40.533
I WOULD WISH ANYONE
TO GET CAUGHT WITH,
BUT IT DID.

18:40.633 --> 18:42.367
IT HAPPENED, AND--

18:42.467 --> 18:44.700
-I MEAN, THE WHOLE THING
WAS JUST A SPUR OF
THE MOMENT THING?

18:44.800 --> 18:46.733
-GUARANTEED, YES.

18:46.833 --> 18:48.667
-YEAH?
-THAT'S WHY IT ENDED UP
LIKE THIS.

18:48.767 --> 18:52.500
IF YOU CAN UNDERSTAND
AND HEAR MY WORDS

18:52.600 --> 18:55.300
AND HEAR HOW I'M, LIKE,
BASICALLY TALKING TO YOU.

18:55.400 --> 18:56.867
-MM-HMM.

18:56.967 --> 19:00.833
-I'M AN INTELLIGENT GUY, I JUST
SPUR OF THE MOMENT (bleep).

19:00.933 --> 19:02.500
-MADE A BAD DECISION.
-YEAH.

19:02.600 --> 19:05.100
-AND ONCE YOU WERE CAUGHT,
I MEAN, YOU FOLLOWED COMMANDS,

19:05.200 --> 19:07.433
AND, YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING
WENT WELL FOR YOU.

19:07.533 --> 19:08.700
RIGHT?

19:08.800 --> 19:10.800
-YEAH, IT'S...

19:10.900 --> 19:13.733
IT'S WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO
BUT, I MEAN, I KNOW I SHOULDN'T
HAVE RAN.

19:13.833 --> 19:15.400
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

19:15.500 --> 19:18.233
BUT AS I STATED BEFORE, I DO
APOLOGIZE FOR HAVING Y'ALL
CHASE ME.

19:18.333 --> 19:21.100
IT'S JUST, IT'S NOT
SOMETHING THAT'S ME.

19:21.200 --> 19:22.533
IT'S NOT ME, PERIOD.

19:22.633 --> 19:25.133
-I APPRECIATE IT.
HONESTLY, WE DON'T GET THAT
HARDLY EVER.

19:25.233 --> 19:27.833
SO THE FACT THAT YOU APOLOGIZED,
IT IS APPRECIATED.

19:27.933 --> 19:28.967
-YEAH.

19:29.067 --> 19:30.633
-AND LIKE I SAID, I HOPE
YOU LEARNED A LESSON

19:30.733 --> 19:31.967
AND YOU CAN MOVE ON
WITH YOUR LIFE.

19:32.067 --> 19:33.967
-RIGHT?
-YEAH, IT'S A BIG LESSON
TO BE LEARNED.

19:34.067 --> 19:35.333
-ALL RIGHT, MAN.
-THANK YOU.

19:35.433 --> 19:36.967
-WATCH YOUR STEP.

19:37.067 --> 19:39.400
-HE SEEMED REMORSEFUL
AND WE DON'T GET APOLOGIZED TO
TOO OFTEN, SO...

19:39.500 --> 19:42.300
HE'S GONNA END UP BEING BOOKED
FOR ATTEMPT ROBBERY

19:42.400 --> 19:44.167
AND POSSESSION OF FIREARM
WITH OBLIVIATED SERIAL NUMBER.

19:44.267 --> 19:46.433
EVERYBODY'S GOING HOME
SAFE TONIGHT AND THAT'S
WHAT'S IMPORTANT.

19:46.533 --> 19:48.633
-HOPEFULLY,
HE'LL LEARN FROM THIS.
-HOPEFULLY HE WILL.

19:49.800 --> 19:50.833
-Officer over radio:
132 AND BUSH.

19:50.933 --> 19:52.500
I'VE GOT HIM AT GUNPOINT.

19:52.600 --> 19:54.267
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, GUNPOINT, 132 AND BUSH.

19:54.367 --> 19:55.300
COVER IS CODE THREE.

19:55.400 --> 19:58.367
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.267 --> 20:06.200
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, STILL SEND A CODE THREE.

20:06.300 --> 20:07.800
-(theme music playing)
