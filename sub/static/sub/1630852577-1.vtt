Hello world, my name is Alyssa

00:37.938 --> 00:40.741
And I'm from the beautiful

00:40.741 --> 00:42.743
Ooh, I'm the first one?

00:43.911 --> 00:45.545
Always number one.
(upbeat dance music)

00:51.952 --> 00:53.287
Finally here! Yes!

00:54.788 --> 00:56.890
Alyssa Hunter, she's a pageant
queen,

00:56.890 --> 00:58.759
but also she can dance.

00:58.759 --> 01:00.327
She can be funny.

01:00.327 --> 01:01.528
She is a superstar.

01:38.198 --> 01:39.700
The demon queen of Seattle.

01:39.700 --> 01:44.404
- Bosco looks like a angry
Minnie Mouse, for me, year.

01:44.404 --> 01:46.406
You are the devil of the season?

01:46.406 --> 01:48.041
- I would say so.
- Ooh!

01:48.041 --> 01:50.110
- I have a big bag of tricks.

01:50.110 --> 01:53.513
I've done, like, Sylvia
Plath spoken word numbers.

01:53.513 --> 01:56.249
I've done Lady Gaga, Britney
mega-mixes.

01:56.249 --> 01:57.451

words

02:32.185 --> 02:34.788

02:34.788 --> 02:35.989

Kornbread?

02:35.989 --> 02:37.891
- LA, I'm a Los Angeles Queen.
- Oh work.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.359
- Yay, I love that.

Carolina

02:39.359 --> 02:40.861
but I'm like a LA Drag Queen.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.396
- You are the hometown queen
right now.

02:42.396 --> 02:43.930
- Yeah, that way when they write
my check,

02:43.930 --> 02:45.165
they just can deliver it to
me.

02:45.165 --> 02:48.235
- Oh baby, well.
(laughing)

02:48.235 --> 02:49.403
- So what kind of drag do you
do?

02:49.403 --> 02:50.437
What are you, a performer?
dancer?

02:50.437 --> 02:51.605

02:51.605 --> 02:53.640
I'm a very versatile queen.

02:53.640 --> 02:54.541
- Oh (beep) and everything.

02:54.541 --> 02:55.409
Now let me tell you,

02:55.409 --> 02:56.943

like to do everything, child

02:56.943 --> 02:58.378

everything-

02:58.378 --> 03:00.514
- Oh sorry bitch!
- I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.549
I'm excited to make sisters.

03:02.549 --> 03:03.650
I'm excited to be making
friends.

03:03.650 --> 03:06.286
I'm excited to eat up
all y'all craft services.

03:06.286 --> 03:10.123
But, um, baby, I'm trying to
win. (laughing)

03:10.123 --> 03:12.292
(exciting music)

03:12.292 --> 03:13.126
- Ooh?

03:16.563 --> 03:18.131
- Where am I?
(laughing)

03:18.131 --> 03:20.700
(upbeat music)

03:20.700 --> 03:22.402
- Paris Hilton is here.

03:22.402 --> 03:23.537
- My name is Willow Pill,

03:23.537 --> 03:25.939
and I'm an adorably twisted
little doll.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.741
- The fucking shirt says
"Angle."

03:27.741 --> 03:29.676
(laughing)
(music resumes)

03:29.676 --> 03:31.344
- Every Willow look is a
different story,

03:31.344 --> 03:34.915
and this girl just
wants money and jewelry,

03:34.915 --> 03:36.183
and hot dogs.

03:36.183 --> 03:38.285
- I think she went in the wrong
show.

03:39.653 --> 03:43.990
Willow's look...
(shady music)

03:43.990 --> 03:46.326
- Girl, I think she left
her shoes at the hotel.

03:46.326 --> 03:47.727
- We got the pool sandal.

03:47.727 --> 03:48.728
- When they said California,

03:48.728 --> 03:50.597
and she thought they meant the
beach.

03:50.597 --> 03:51.431
(laughing)

03:51.431 --> 03:53.033
- Hi children of the lord!

03:53.033 --> 03:54.468
Hi girls.
- Oh my goodness.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.903
- Oh my god, I'm the devil to
your angle.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.171
Come here!

03:58.171 --> 04:00.574
- I'm Willow.
- Hi, Kornbre

04:00.574 --> 04:02.442
I like those shoes.

04:02.442 --> 04:04.611
Comfy couture.
(laughing)

04:04.611 --> 04:05.912
- Are you playing the
Snatch Game right now,

04:05.912 --> 04:07.481
like Paris Hilton?
- Oh, no no no.

04:07.481 --> 04:08.315
- Legally Blonde?

04:08.315 --> 04:09.583
- This is completely me.
- Oh that's completely you.

04:09.583 --> 04:10.417
Oh okay.

04:10.417 --> 04:11.551
This is your signature style.

04:11.551 --> 04:12.619
- Yeah, absolutely.

04:12.619 --> 04:15.155
- Oh okay.
- Tell us about you, Willow.

04:15.155 --> 04:17.390
I done talked to these hoes too
much.

04:17.390 --> 04:20.694
- I have not been in drag,
in like, over a year.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.395
- What?
- Because of COVID.

04:22.395 --> 04:26.199
So, this is my big dip back into
drag.

04:26.199 --> 04:27.434
So we'll see how it goes.

04:27.434 --> 04:28.268
- You should be the most
comfortable,

04:28.268 --> 04:29.970
when you came in here
in those fluffy shoes.

04:29.970 --> 04:32.105
- Yeah.
(laughing)

04:32.105 --> 04:33.507
- Oh shit!
- Glasses!

04:34.608 --> 04:35.709
- Well.

04:35.709 --> 04:36.943
- So what is your aesthetic?

04:36.943 --> 04:39.179
- I see that, the little angel,
oh, again?

04:39.179 --> 04:40.080
Baby, what's happening?

04:40.080 --> 04:41.448
- Sis, just put them in your
purse.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.116
You're gonna have to
just let that spirit go.

04:43.116 --> 04:46.086
Miss Willow baby is just
a little bit nervous.

04:46.086 --> 04:47.888
Shaking in her boots,

04:47.888 --> 04:48.722
or flip flops.

04:50.624 --> 04:53.927
(suspenseful music)

04:53.927 --> 04:55.562
- I have one thing to say.

04:55.562 --> 04:56.396
Baby you already know

04:56.396 --> 04:58.198
every kiss begins with a K.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.168
(upbeat dance music)

05:01.168 --> 05:02.102
I am Kerri Colby,

05:02.102 --> 05:05.672
and I'm here to be your
new viral obsession.

05:05.672 --> 05:09.576
My drag style and aesthetic
is very bodacious.

05:09.576 --> 05:10.410
(laughing)

05:10.410 --> 05:12.279
Big boobs, no waist, big butt.

05:12.279 --> 05:15.048
I am wearing the transgender
flag colors.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.783
I'm letting people know who I
am.

05:16.783 --> 05:18.685
From my hair down to my toes,
bitch.

05:18.685 --> 05:20.387
I am white, blue, and pink.

05:21.254 --> 05:22.989
- Oh my gosh.
(lively music)

05:22.989 --> 05:24.624
Kerri is like,

05:24.624 --> 05:26.493
it's like looking in the sun.

05:26.493 --> 05:29.095
It hurts my eyes because
she's so gorgeous.

05:31.097 --> 05:33.833
- Miss thing, miss thing!
- Hi!

05:33.833 --> 05:34.668
- Oh my god.
- Hi!

05:34.668 --> 05:35.969
- What's up? How are you?

05:35.969 --> 05:38.538
- Kornbread is my good Judy.

05:38.538 --> 05:40.574
I know her from LA, she's a LA
sister.

05:40.574 --> 05:41.942
- I am so excited to see you.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.577
It's about to be a full on ki,
honey.

05:43.577 --> 05:44.911
- Aunties Anonymous, honey.

05:44.911 --> 05:47.347
(all laughing)

05:47.347 --> 05:49.082
- Are you doing pageants before?

05:49.082 --> 05:50.650
- I have not done pageants,

05:50.650 --> 05:53.520
but my drag mother, she won
Continental.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.088
- Oh, where's your drag mother?

05:55.088 --> 05:56.656
- Sasha Colby.
- Sasha (beep).

05:57.557 --> 06:00.827
- My drag mother is pretty
well known to the community.

06:00.827 --> 06:02.229
She's an amazing performer,

06:02.229 --> 06:05.131
and she is a Miss Continental
winner.

06:05.131 --> 06:06.399
- I can't stop looking at you.

06:06.399 --> 06:07.934
- Oh my god, thank you!

06:07.934 --> 06:09.369
Look all you want, honey.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.503
- Take it in.
(laughing)

06:10.503 --> 06:12.038
- I definitely feel eyes on me.

06:12.038 --> 06:14.241
They seem to be eating
up that Kerri fantasy.

06:14.241 --> 06:16.409
I mean, stare some more if you
want.

06:16.409 --> 06:17.611
(laughing)

06:17.611 --> 06:20.380
(exciting music)

06:21.548 --> 06:24.818
- Grab a fork, ladies,
Jambalaya is served.

06:24.818 --> 06:25.852
- Bitch, that's June.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.923
- Hello everyone, I'm June
Jambalaya.

06:29.923 --> 06:33.660
Imagine if Megan Thee
Stallion and Phaedra Parks

06:33.660 --> 06:35.028
had a baby.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.596
That's June Jambalaya.

06:36.596 --> 06:40.133
She is southern, savage.

06:40.133 --> 06:43.003
She has on her Emilio Coochie
jumpsuit.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.704
I am ready to sprinkle seasoning

06:44.704 --> 06:46.439
all up and through this bitch.

06:46.439 --> 06:47.974
- June!
(laughing)

06:47.974 --> 06:50.343
They done let you in the
damn building, bitch.

06:50.343 --> 06:51.811
June and I definitely go back.

06:51.811 --> 06:53.179
That's my sister, I love her.

06:53.179 --> 06:56.283
Super talented, and a label
whore.

06:56.283 --> 06:58.385
June will spend money on some
damn stuff.

06:58.385 --> 06:59.352
Don't care if it fit or not,

06:59.352 --> 07:00.820
June gonna buy it.

07:00.820 --> 07:01.955
- I see ass, honey.

07:01.955 --> 07:05.659
- Yeah, it's, no, it's real.
(Queens wailing)

07:05.659 --> 07:06.993
- We got a whole country
meal in here, bitch.

07:06.993 --> 07:08.495
- Yeah yeah.
- June Jambalaya

07:08.495 --> 07:10.463
and the Kornbread.
- You eat it together.

07:10.463 --> 07:12.866
- Yeah, and we eat it on
the beach with her shoes.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.768
(all laughing)

07:14.768 --> 07:17.170
- I'm here, and in the
words of Effie White,

07:17.170 --> 07:18.171
you're gonna love me.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.039
Team Chunky.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.007
- Baby thicker than a Snicker,
honey.

07:21.007 --> 07:23.076
- Yes, honey, more
curves than a race track.

07:23.076 --> 07:26.179
(all laughing)

07:26.179 --> 07:31.184
(suspenseful music)
(high pitch shrieking)

07:32.485 --> 07:34.421
- What am I hearing?

07:34.421 --> 07:35.855
Was that a whistle tone?

07:35.855 --> 07:37.924
(beep)

07:37.924 --> 07:39.426
- Hello, RuPaul?

07:39.426 --> 07:40.460
Yes, we've been trying to reach
you

07:40.460 --> 07:42.829
regarding your car's extended
warranty.

07:42.829 --> 07:43.830
Oh perfect.

07:43.830 --> 07:46.199
Well then I just have one
more question for you.

07:46.199 --> 07:47.467
Are you ready boots?

07:48.435 --> 07:50.337
- Opening paragraph.
(exciting music)

07:50.337 --> 07:52.005
- My name is Orion Story,

07:52.005 --> 07:54.708
and I am West Michigan's
premiere fem bot.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.242
I wanted to start off with a
bang,

07:56.242 --> 07:59.479
starting off obnoxious and
crazy,

07:59.479 --> 08:02.015
and show these girls that
I did not come to play.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.049
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:03.049 --> 08:04.351
- Don't worry, it's not a real
burger.

08:04.351 --> 08:05.552
In N Out.
- Ooh.

08:05.552 --> 08:06.653
(laughing)

08:06.653 --> 08:07.487
- Tell us about you.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.755
Who are you, where are you from,

08:08.755 --> 08:09.589
and all that good stuff.

08:09.589 --> 08:10.924
- I'm from Grand Rapids,
Michigan.

08:10.924 --> 08:12.459
The first girl representing
Michigan.

08:12.459 --> 08:13.326
- Nice.
- Ooh. (clapping)

08:13.326 --> 08:15.695
- So I'd say I'm pretty campy.

08:15.695 --> 08:17.831
I love puppets, I love bright
colors.

08:17.831 --> 08:18.631
- Yes.
(upbeat music)

08:18.631 --> 08:20.834
- The best way that I
could describe Orion Story

08:20.834 --> 08:22.669
is if you took Barbarella,

08:22.669 --> 08:24.304
put her on a runway

08:24.304 --> 08:25.839
in the middle of Sesame Street.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.474
- I'm living for this
silhouette.

08:27.474 --> 08:28.908
Body everything.

08:28.908 --> 08:30.243
- I made everything that I'm
wearing.

08:30.243 --> 08:31.678
- Yes!

08:31.678 --> 08:32.579
- You're giving me a little bit
of like,

08:32.579 --> 08:33.680
Lana del Rey vibes.

08:33.680 --> 08:36.316
- I get that a lot.
(siren wailing)

08:36.316 --> 08:37.183
- [RuPaul] Ooh, girl!

08:37.183 --> 08:40.720
She done already done had
herses.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.655
(suspenseful music)

08:42.655 --> 08:45.258
- That alarm sounded a little
early.

08:45.258 --> 08:46.359
That immediately tells me

08:46.359 --> 08:48.695
it's gonna be a one-two punch.

08:48.695 --> 08:49.696
- There's only seven of us,

08:49.696 --> 08:53.366
so clearly, this is a split
premiere.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.034
- Alright, half and half.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.169
Here we go.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.538
I feel good about their
splitting us up.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.340
There only being seven of us

09:00.340 --> 09:04.110
gives me plenty of time to
like, grab the spotlight.

09:04.110 --> 09:05.412
- My queens!

09:05.412 --> 09:06.780
(Queens exclaiming)

09:06.780 --> 09:08.381
Welcome to RuPaul's Drag Race.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.216
A magical place, no doubt,

09:10.216 --> 09:12.519
where you can go tuck yourself.

09:12.519 --> 09:14.721
Or let it all hang out.

09:14.721 --> 09:18.658
So open your heart, and take a
deep dive.

09:18.658 --> 09:21.094
'Cause Queen, you better pop
that pussy

09:21.094 --> 09:23.897
if you want to survive.

09:23.897 --> 09:27.233
- Yes!
- [All] Woo!

09:27.233 --> 09:28.067
(suspenseful music)

09:28.067 --> 09:31.538
- Hello hello hello!
(Queens cheering)

09:31.538 --> 09:33.239
- Yes!
- Mother!

09:33.239 --> 09:36.476
- My Queens, you made it.

09:36.476 --> 09:38.545
Welcome to the season premiere

09:38.545 --> 09:40.847
of RuPaul's Drag Race.
(Queens cheering)

09:40.847 --> 09:43.149
Now, Drag Race is all over the
world,

09:43.149 --> 09:45.084
but I gotta say,

09:45.084 --> 09:48.288
I can't get enough of that
original recipe, honey.

09:48.288 --> 09:51.424
American charisma,
uniqueness, nerve, and talent?

09:52.525 --> 09:55.094
Mm, mm, mm, finger-licking good.

09:55.094 --> 09:56.429
(all laughing)

09:56.429 --> 09:59.232
Now, to get to know each of you
better,

09:59.232 --> 10:02.168
we are introducing the season 14
Queens

10:02.168 --> 10:03.937
over two episodes.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.339
And you are the first to arrive.

10:06.339 --> 10:08.508
- Woo!
- Fresh out the oven, girl.

10:08.508 --> 10:10.443
- But don't be doing no
half-steppin'.

10:10.443 --> 10:11.811
(suspenseful music)

10:11.811 --> 10:15.081
Because the competition starts
now.

10:15.081 --> 10:18.418
And before this premiere episode
is over,

10:18.418 --> 10:21.120
one of you will sashay away.

10:22.188 --> 10:25.091
(suspenseful music)

10:25.091 --> 10:26.526
What, does that upset you?

10:28.194 --> 10:30.763
Oh don't get mad, get
everything.

10:31.998 --> 10:33.099
- Cha-ching.

10:33.099 --> 10:34.868
- Now, for our first big
opening,

10:34.868 --> 10:36.269
I want to kick things off

10:36.269 --> 10:38.738
with a freaky photo shoot.

10:38.738 --> 10:39.973
(laughing)

10:39.973 --> 10:41.774
Are y'all ready for your
closeup?

10:41.774 --> 10:44.310
- Yes!
- Yes, Mr. DeVille.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.012
- I'll be the judge of that.

10:46.012 --> 10:47.247
- Oh (beep)
(shady music)

10:47.247 --> 10:49.148
- Let's go!
(suspenseful music)

10:49.148 --> 10:50.884
- It just got real.

10:50.884 --> 10:54.554
I am (beep) bricks.

10:54.554 --> 10:56.823
It is nerves.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.324
I am shaking like a stripper

10:58.324 --> 10:59.559
on a Friday night, honey.

11:01.628 --> 11:04.597
(upbeat dance music)

11:04.597 --> 11:07.166
- Alyssa Hunter.
- Hello.

11:07.166 --> 11:08.134
- Hey lady.

11:08.134 --> 11:11.738
Say hello to celebrity
photographer, Albert Sanchez.

11:11.738 --> 11:12.605
- Hi!

11:12.605 --> 11:14.374
- For today's photo shoot,

11:14.374 --> 11:17.377
you need to serve face face
face.

11:17.377 --> 11:20.513
And you'll be doing it on this
spinning,

11:20.513 --> 11:24.784
grand finale lip sync smack
down for the crown wheel.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.487
- What?

11:27.487 --> 11:29.589
I am freaking out right now.

11:29.589 --> 11:33.493
- We will decide if your
face will belong there.

11:33.493 --> 11:37.030
- My first time here and I'm
gonna die in the first day.

11:37.030 --> 11:37.864
(suspenseful music)

11:37.864 --> 11:38.998
Oh my god.
- Yes, Pit Crew.

11:38.998 --> 11:40.600
Strap her in.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.001
- Oh my god, this is crazy.

11:42.001 --> 11:43.870
- When was the last time you had
two men

11:43.870 --> 11:44.971
put you in a harness?

11:44.971 --> 11:46.940
- Last night, oh no, just
kidding.

11:46.940 --> 11:49.075
- Now, of course, your camera is
out here.

11:49.075 --> 11:50.877
We're going to start the spin.

11:50.877 --> 11:53.613
- Oh, I don't know about this,
do this.

11:53.613 --> 11:54.647
- Release the Kraken.

11:55.915 --> 11:57.050
And here we go.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.618
Model, model.
(camera clicking)

11:58.618 --> 12:01.621
Woo, spin that wheel, spin that
wheel.

12:01.621 --> 12:02.755
Yes.

12:02.755 --> 12:04.223
Can you go a little faster?

12:04.223 --> 12:05.124
(laughing)

12:05.124 --> 12:06.826
- Baby, I feel like Hurricane
Maria

12:06.826 --> 12:08.761
spinning all around and round
(wooing).

12:09.629 --> 12:10.964
(suspenseful music)

12:10.964 --> 12:13.266
I don't see anything right now.

12:13.266 --> 12:16.469
I just only see RuPaul's face
like this.

12:16.469 --> 12:19.272
(RuPauls laughing)
(lively music)

12:19.272 --> 12:20.907
Tookoo tookoo tookoo.

12:20.907 --> 12:23.109
- Yes, honey, you are roast
killing it.

12:23.109 --> 12:25.745
Yes, fantastic.

12:25.745 --> 12:26.579
(spitting)

12:26.579 --> 12:27.413
June Jambalaya!

12:30.283 --> 12:31.150
- I'm going up there?

12:31.150 --> 12:33.052
- You're going up there.

12:33.052 --> 12:34.754
- Ooh, okay.
(laughing)

12:34.754 --> 12:37.023
I'm about to get harnessed
up on this thing,

12:37.023 --> 12:37.857
and spin my big ass around

12:37.857 --> 12:40.393
like a god damn Ferris wheel.

12:40.393 --> 12:42.795
- Alright so let's turn some
looks.

12:42.795 --> 12:44.897
Yes June, let them have it.

12:44.897 --> 12:46.733
What's she got in that
Jambalaya?

12:46.733 --> 12:49.102
I know she got some mango.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.104
She got some ham.

12:51.104 --> 12:54.507
She got some celery.
(laughing)

12:54.507 --> 12:57.377
- Like, that's not Jambalaya.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.946
- I don't know what's in
Jambalaya!

12:59.946 --> 13:03.049
Please welcome to the wheel,
Willow Pill.

13:03.049 --> 13:05.485
It's a whittle itty-bitty pill.

13:05.485 --> 13:08.254
You want a big pill or
you want a Willow Pill?

13:08.254 --> 13:09.656
Hi, Willow Pill.

13:09.656 --> 13:11.991
- Hello, RuPaul.
- You are a Willow Pill.

13:11.991 --> 13:13.292
- Very little one.

13:13.292 --> 13:15.628
- Fellas, would you help her up?

13:15.628 --> 13:17.330
Spin that wheel, Pit Crew.

13:18.364 --> 13:20.066
Bruno and Bryce.
(Willow wailing)

13:20.066 --> 13:21.334
Yeah, party!

13:22.568 --> 13:25.705
- I feel like I'm gonna
throw up, first of all.

13:25.705 --> 13:27.140
My hair's going everywhere,

13:27.140 --> 13:28.808
and my panties are coming out.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.877
- [RuPaul] Oh, I think
I can see your religion.

13:30.877 --> 13:33.379
- But I thrive being thrown
around.

13:33.379 --> 13:34.681
That sounded really dirty.

13:36.015 --> 13:36.849
- [RuPaul] Woo!

13:36.849 --> 13:38.584
You look like a young Angelyne.

13:39.719 --> 13:42.755
- Ugh!
(laughing)

13:42.755 --> 13:44.457
- Orion Story.
(exciting music)

13:44.457 --> 13:46.859
Let's see how grand your rapids
are.

13:46.859 --> 13:48.494
- The wheels are spinning,

13:48.494 --> 13:50.830
physically and in my head.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.766
- Let's see you have a glamorous
headache.

13:55.201 --> 13:56.836
Now stroke those handles.

13:57.804 --> 14:00.039
(laughing)

14:01.774 --> 14:04.744
Orion, the greatest story ever
spun.

14:04.744 --> 14:06.713
Do you ever have vertigo, Bosco?

14:06.713 --> 14:08.981
- No, but I've been told
that my head's great.

14:08.981 --> 14:11.651
(laughing)

14:11.651 --> 14:15.221
Out of drag, I look like a
piece of peeled string cheese.

14:15.221 --> 14:17.790
But in drag, I know how to make
it work.

14:17.790 --> 14:19.726
- [RuPaul] Face face face.

14:19.726 --> 14:21.694
What was the hardest part of
doing this?

14:21.694 --> 14:24.130
- Me.
(laughing)

14:24.130 --> 14:27.133
- Keep calm and Kerri Colby.

14:27.133 --> 14:28.434
Let's go around the world.

14:28.434 --> 14:30.737
Round the world with Kerri
Colby.

14:30.737 --> 14:32.572
Yes, work that camera.

14:32.572 --> 14:33.840
- What the (beep) kind of

14:33.840 --> 14:36.876
Wheel of Fortune (beep) is this?

14:36.876 --> 14:38.344
I am not a ferret,
(lively music)

14:38.344 --> 14:40.513
or a rabbit, or a hamster.

14:40.513 --> 14:41.981
None of the above.

14:41.981 --> 14:44.584
I am not a ferret.
(laughing)

14:44.584 --> 14:46.953
I don't think they run around on
wheels.

14:46.953 --> 14:49.222
(laughing)

14:50.556 --> 14:52.759
But I'm not one!
(upbeat music)

14:52.759 --> 14:56.362
- She looks like Spinda
Evangelista.

14:56.362 --> 14:58.064
Kornbread with a K.

14:58.064 --> 15:01.200
Spin that wheel, spin that
wheel.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.536
Come on, Kornbread, yes,
Kornbread.

15:03.536 --> 15:05.238
Oh Kornbread, you just stopped.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.573
Oh, Kornbread's turning the
(beep) around.

15:07.573 --> 15:08.474
- Hell yeah!
- Kornbread goes,

15:08.474 --> 15:10.977
turn that damn thing over-
(laughing)

15:10.977 --> 15:13.846
- Wait, is that me spinning it
now?

15:13.846 --> 15:14.814
(laughing)

15:14.814 --> 15:16.983
Bitch, I thought they was on the
side!

15:16.983 --> 15:19.285
- Kornbread's turning back time!

15:19.285 --> 15:21.554
(laughing)

15:23.356 --> 15:25.658
My Queens.
(all exclaiming)

15:25.658 --> 15:28.928
Now, you all did a wheelie good
job.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.864

challenge is,

15:36.636 --> 15:38.437
- Girl, I'm excited as hell that
I won.

15:38.437 --> 15:41.440

pictures was just gonna be-

(laughing)

15:49.348 --> 15:50.416
- Now, my Queens,

15:50.416 --> 15:53.286
if you thought that was
dizzying,

15:53.286 --> 15:56.923
just you wait.
(laughing)

15:56.923 --> 15:59.192
Now, for your very first maxi
challenge,

15:59.192 --> 16:00.993

missing is U.

16:13.172 --> 16:14.607
(all laughing)

16:14.607 --> 16:16.843
Take a minute to figure that
out.

We love to see it.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.244
- The game has begun, y'all.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.145
We are at the top of the roller
coaster,

16:53.145 --> 16:54.981
and this (beep) is about to
drop.

16:55.948 --> 16:58.517
(exciting music)

16:58.517 --> 17:00.052
- Where's the Pit Crew?

17:00.052 --> 17:01.320
We did the first mini challenge.

17:01.320 --> 17:02.588
The lease is signed, honey.

17:02.588 --> 17:04.223
We are moving in the Werk Room.

17:04.223 --> 17:05.925
- I knew you was a top, June.

17:05.925 --> 17:07.727
I know you was a top, bitch.
(laughing)

17:07.727 --> 17:08.928
I'm excited to get out of drag,

17:08.928 --> 17:09.829
'cause you know, this is
where you really get to see

17:09.829 --> 17:11.731
who the girls are.

17:11.731 --> 17:12.865
'Cause they look real pretty

17:12.865 --> 17:13.866
with the foundation on their
face,

17:13.866 --> 17:16.435
but what y'all look like up up
under here?

17:16.435 --> 17:17.270
- Oh.

17:17.270 --> 17:20.773
- Get this shit off of me!

17:20.773 --> 17:21.774
- What?

17:21.774 --> 17:24.210
Bosco has the biggest
transformation.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.279
I do not recognize her at all.

17:26.279 --> 17:27.346
- Is this your real hair?

17:27.346 --> 17:28.381
- Yeah.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.850
- Wow, I love it.

17:30.850 --> 17:31.684
Love it.

17:31.684 --> 17:32.518
Give me some wig!

17:32.518 --> 17:35.154
To me, the hottest in
the group out of drag,

17:35.154 --> 17:37.356
obviously is me.
(laughing)

17:37.356 --> 17:38.391
Just kidding, just kidding.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.326
Hi.
- Oh (beep).

17:40.326 --> 17:41.460
- How are you guys?

17:41.460 --> 17:43.729
- That's that Puerto Rico.
- Yeah.

17:45.598 --> 17:50.369
- Damn!
(upbeat music)

17:50.369 --> 17:51.704
Hey Miss Alyssa.

17:52.738 --> 17:54.774
- Now she Willy.
(laughing)

17:54.774 --> 17:56.008
Now she Willy.

17:56.008 --> 17:57.343
- Way to, I knew it.
- She will be

17:57.343 --> 17:58.511
your slice of Kornbread.
- Up under there.

17:58.511 --> 17:59.345
(laughing)

17:59.345 --> 18:02.014
- When I say that is a handsome
Latin man,

18:02.014 --> 18:03.683
I was like, oh.

18:04.617 --> 18:07.053
Como estas, como estas, hola.

18:09.255 --> 18:10.356
(upbeat music)

18:10.356 --> 18:11.257
- Jesus Christ,

18:11.257 --> 18:12.959
you went from a grown woman to
12.

18:13.859 --> 18:15.728
- And it's Macaulay Culkin.

18:15.728 --> 18:16.729
(all laughing)

18:16.729 --> 18:18.397
- Miss Willow went from

18:18.397 --> 18:20.999
somebody's cook-a-hoe housewife,

18:20.999 --> 18:23.302
to a child, right in the magic
of my face.

18:23.302 --> 18:24.603
I am gooped, gagged, and
gandered.

18:24.603 --> 18:27.306
- You look like five years old,
bitch.

18:27.306 --> 18:28.140
- Oh thank you.
(laughing)

18:28.140 --> 18:29.809
- Bitch, isn't the age limit?

18:29.809 --> 18:30.643
What's the age limit?

18:30.643 --> 18:32.578
I'm about to call CPS,

18:32.578 --> 18:34.981
'cause I said somebody is
missing their kid up in here.

18:34.981 --> 18:36.716
- Wait, how old are you?

18:36.716 --> 18:38.017
- I'm 26.
- Okay.

18:38.017 --> 18:39.952
Alright, we'll allow that.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.887
- These queens were
already underestimating

18:41.887 --> 18:44.256
my entrance look, and now
they see me out of drag,

18:44.256 --> 18:46.158
they're underestimating me even
more.

18:46.158 --> 18:47.793
I have all the surprises in the
world

18:47.793 --> 18:49.829
in store for these girls.

18:49.829 --> 18:52.264
- So what's everyone doing
for their talent show number?

18:52.264 --> 18:53.699
- Oh, competitive eating.

18:53.699 --> 18:54.533
(laughing)

18:54.533 --> 18:55.901
I'm not even joking.
- You're not even-

18:55.901 --> 18:57.269
- Yeah yeah yeah.

18:57.269 --> 18:59.138
- I'm ready to see it happen.
- I'm gonna try to eat

18:59.138 --> 19:02.341
120 hot dogs in 60 seconds.
- Ooh, that's a talent, bitch.

19:02.341 --> 19:03.609
- What the (beep) are you doing
tomorrow?

19:03.609 --> 19:05.244
- No, I'm 100% eating.

19:05.244 --> 19:06.312
Eating hot dogs.

19:07.546 --> 19:08.381
They believing it,

19:08.381 --> 19:10.016
but the bread not doing that,
miss thing.

19:10.016 --> 19:12.385
I will be lip syncing to my
original song.

19:12.385 --> 19:14.620
But I'm about to eat gas up on
this stage.

19:16.055 --> 19:17.323
(upbeat music)

19:17.323 --> 19:20.626
- Hey dolls.
(all exclaiming)

19:20.626 --> 19:23.062
I'm here to do some talent
scouting.

19:23.062 --> 19:24.697
(all laughing)

19:24.697 --> 19:26.065
Alright, Kerri Colby.

19:26.065 --> 19:29.135
I own 51% of this company.

19:29.135 --> 19:30.669
- Hello, how are you?

19:30.669 --> 19:31.504
- I'm doing great.

19:31.504 --> 19:35.674
Were you aware of the show
"The Colby's" and "Dynasty"

19:35.674 --> 19:36.976
when you chose your name?
- Yes.

19:36.976 --> 19:40.946
My grandmother, who
designed the House of Colby,

19:40.946 --> 19:44.116
based it off of the Dynasty
Colby's from the 80s.

19:44.116 --> 19:45.918
- Yes.
(laughing)

19:45.918 --> 19:47.553
- I had to reach.

19:47.553 --> 19:50.689
My drag house is the Colby
Dynasty.

19:50.689 --> 19:53.526
It's a drag family that
originates from Hawaii.

19:53.526 --> 19:56.162
All of them are sickening
performers.

19:56.162 --> 19:57.797
And I'm so ready to show

19:57.797 --> 20:00.666
that I am one of the fiercest
Colby's in the house.

20:00.666 --> 20:01.634
- Where are you from originally?

20:01.634 --> 20:03.402
- I'm originally from Dallas,
Texas.

20:03.402 --> 20:05.037
- You don't have a southern
accent.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.138
- My mom, growing up,

20:06.138 --> 20:10.176
was very on top me when
it came to how I spoke.

20:10.176 --> 20:13.546
I wasn't really allowed
to speak too twang-ish.

20:13.546 --> 20:16.048
- Your mom sounds like
quite the task-master.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.316
Are you still friends with her?

20:17.316 --> 20:18.451
- It's complicated,

20:18.451 --> 20:20.719
but she's super evangelical.

20:20.719 --> 20:22.521
She's Pentecostal.
- Really?

20:22.521 --> 20:23.355
- [Kerri] Yeah.

20:23.355 --> 20:24.490
- So tell me about your talent.

20:24.490 --> 20:26.092
- I'm going to be doing
something

20:26.092 --> 20:29.061
I used to do competitively when
I was 14.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.729
I'm doing jump roping.

20:30.729 --> 20:31.630
- Oh that sounds fun.

20:31.630 --> 20:32.765
Like double Dutch-ing?

20:32.765 --> 20:33.966
- I did used to do that,

20:33.966 --> 20:35.367
but I'm gonna be doing kind of
like

20:35.367 --> 20:37.570
a single showcase.

20:37.570 --> 20:38.838
- What got you into that?

20:38.838 --> 20:40.139
- I was home schooled,

20:40.139 --> 20:42.374
and my mom wanted me to stay
active,

20:42.374 --> 20:44.310
and there was a jump rope team

20:44.310 --> 20:46.912
at a place called Shady Shores
Elementary.

20:46.912 --> 20:49.582
(laughing)

20:49.582 --> 20:50.683
I know.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.585
And I picked it up, got better
and better,

20:52.585 --> 20:53.886
and within the end of that year,

20:53.886 --> 20:56.422
they enrolled me in the
nationals competition.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.958
- From Shady Shores to the
Nationals.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.659
- Period!
- I love it.

21:00.659 --> 21:02.428
- Jump roping, it was something
that like,

21:02.428 --> 21:05.397
brought me joy in a
time of a lot of chaos.

21:05.397 --> 21:07.766
- Thank you Miss Kerri Colby.
- Bye.

21:07.766 --> 21:09.568
But it's gonna be tricky because

21:09.568 --> 21:13.439
I have not touched a jump
rope in about 10 years.

21:13.439 --> 21:15.808
- Alright June Jambalaya, come
on over.

21:15.808 --> 21:18.644
How would you categorize
your style of drag?

21:18.644 --> 21:20.379
- June is cla-tchet.

21:20.379 --> 21:21.680
- She's cla-tchet?

21:21.680 --> 21:23.516
- Classy-ratchet.

21:23.516 --> 21:24.850
- Alright, I can get with that.

21:24.850 --> 21:25.718
Where are you from, June?

21:25.718 --> 21:26.552
- Jacksonville, Florida.

21:26.552 --> 21:28.287
- And you live in Los Angeles
now.

21:28.287 --> 21:29.121
- I live in LA.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.189
I've been here eight years.

21:30.189 --> 21:31.457
- What brought you out here?

21:31.457 --> 21:33.592
- I transferred from Orlando

21:33.592 --> 21:35.227
to go to school for fine arts
here.

21:35.227 --> 21:37.830
Musical theater, dance, vocal.

21:37.830 --> 21:40.799
But I think dance was
like, what stuck with me.

21:40.799 --> 21:42.268
- You mean, "donce" don't you?

21:42.268 --> 21:43.235
- Donce, darling.

21:43.235 --> 21:44.737
- So what's your talent gonna
be?

21:44.737 --> 21:45.638
- African dance.

21:45.638 --> 21:46.939
- Ooh, that's gonna be
interesting.

21:46.939 --> 21:49.375
Is that gonna be your
edge over the other girls?

21:49.375 --> 21:50.776
- Yeah, it is.

21:50.776 --> 21:52.511
Let me not be shy, it is.

21:52.511 --> 21:54.813
I can't have a name like
Jambalaya,

21:54.813 --> 21:56.982
and come out there giving
the people white rice.

21:56.982 --> 21:58.217
That just ain't gonna happen.

21:58.217 --> 22:00.119
- [RuPaul] Well, you have fun
out there.

22:00.119 --> 22:03.088
- I need to pull out all
my big Black girl magic,

22:03.088 --> 22:04.123
and deliver tomorrow.

22:04.990 --> 22:07.059
- Orion Story.
(dance music)

22:07.059 --> 22:10.229
You fancy yourself a Drag Daniel
Boone?

22:10.229 --> 22:11.664
- Yeah, like a dandelion.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.332
- Dandelion Boone.
- Yeah.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.935
- It's very interesting
watching your audition tape.

22:15.935 --> 22:16.869
Very introspective.

22:17.970 --> 22:19.438
- Absolutely.
- Where does that come from?

22:19.438 --> 22:20.739
You spend a lot of time alone?

22:20.739 --> 22:21.574
- Yeah.

22:21.574 --> 22:23.776
Growing up, my family
was super dysfunctional,

22:23.776 --> 22:26.879
so I spent a lot of time
in my room by myself,

22:26.879 --> 22:29.548
just crafting, making my
own clothes, and like,

22:29.548 --> 22:32.184
recreating red carpet looks and
stuff.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.018
(RuPaul laughs)

22:33.018 --> 22:34.353
- So tell me about your talent.

22:34.353 --> 22:37.389
- I thought I was gonna
do a little comedy skit.

22:37.389 --> 22:40.793
Kind of aerobics, trailer park
fantasy.

22:40.793 --> 22:42.795
- Well just make sure that
when you get out there

22:42.795 --> 22:45.798
on that stage, you are full
throttle.

22:45.798 --> 22:48.434
I can't wait to see the story
unfold

22:48.434 --> 22:50.469
before our very eyes.

22:50.469 --> 22:52.371
Thank you.
- Yeah.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.740
- Alright, Willow Pill.

22:54.740 --> 22:55.608
- Hi Ru.
- Now,

22:55.608 --> 22:58.143
you're an oddball, aren't ya?

22:58.143 --> 22:59.044
- I think so.

22:59.044 --> 23:00.779
- Do you have a tribe of people?

23:00.779 --> 23:01.614
- I do.

23:01.614 --> 23:04.183
I think, honestly, Yvie
helped me find my odd side.

23:04.183 --> 23:05.951
- [RuPaul] Yvie Oddly,
and how did you meet Yvie?

23:05.951 --> 23:09.622
- I met her at my very
first drag show that I did.

23:09.622 --> 23:11.624
And I got to know her when I
actually made

23:11.624 --> 23:14.827
a little documentary
about her for college.

23:14.827 --> 23:17.563
- Where'd you get your sense of
humor?

23:17.563 --> 23:18.664
- Darkness.
- Darkness.

23:18.664 --> 23:20.666
That's always the case, isn't
it?

23:20.666 --> 23:23.035
- It is.
- Tell me about your darkness.

23:23.035 --> 23:25.638
- I grew up chronically ill my
whole life,

23:25.638 --> 23:27.539
and there was just a lot of
trauma there.

23:27.539 --> 23:29.408
And I thought, why not make it
funny?

23:29.408 --> 23:30.242
- Exactly.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.777
What is your chronic illness?

23:31.777 --> 23:33.512
- It's called cystinosis.

23:33.512 --> 23:34.880
And it just blocks your kidneys

23:34.880 --> 23:36.615
and your eyeballs and your
fingers.

23:36.615 --> 23:37.449
- Wow.
- It grows little

23:37.449 --> 23:38.350
crystals in your eyes.

23:38.350 --> 23:41.887
It's very glamorous, yes.
(laughing)

23:41.887 --> 23:42.855
- Oh my goodness.

23:42.855 --> 23:45.124
I'm having fun with Willow Pill.

23:45.124 --> 23:47.026
So what are you gonna do for
your talent?

23:47.026 --> 23:48.127
Are you gonna get up on stage

23:48.127 --> 23:49.461
and shoot a documentary?

23:49.461 --> 23:51.297
- I'm actually gonna do

23:51.297 --> 23:54.033
like a mix of a lip sync,

23:54.033 --> 23:57.069
and a self care tutorial.

23:57.069 --> 23:57.903
- Okay.

23:58.837 --> 24:00.005
- For my talent,

24:00.005 --> 24:02.074
I want to tell a story about me.

24:02.074 --> 24:03.976
My drag is very chaotic,

24:03.976 --> 24:06.278
and I don't know if people
are gonna understand it.

24:06.278 --> 24:08.914
So, fingers crossed?

24:08.914 --> 24:10.549
It'll be funny.

24:10.549 --> 24:12.184
- Okay, I'll be the judge of
that.

24:12.184 --> 24:13.919
Alright, I'll see you out there.

24:13.919 --> 24:16.255
- Willow Pillow seems like, I
don't know

24:16.255 --> 24:18.324
what she's doing for her talent.

24:18.324 --> 24:20.292
I feel worried about her.

24:20.292 --> 24:21.493
- [Producer] Willow Pill.

24:21.493 --> 24:24.930
- Ah, it's not Pillow?
(gentle music)

24:24.930 --> 24:26.398
Pillow or Pill?

24:26.398 --> 24:27.599
- [Producer] Willow Pill.

24:27.599 --> 24:28.967
- Oh, it's Willow Pill.

24:28.967 --> 24:31.337
Oh, (beep), oh I thought
it was Willow Pillow.

24:31.337 --> 24:33.539
Oh my god.
(laughing)

24:33.539 --> 24:35.074
Sorry!

24:35.074 --> 24:37.543
- Alright lady-kins, gather
'round.

24:37.543 --> 24:39.345
Tomorrow, we will be joined

24:39.345 --> 24:41.714
by our extra special guest
judge,

24:42.948 --> 24:45.250
Lizzo!
(all cheering)

24:45.250 --> 24:46.085
- Oh my god!

24:48.354 --> 24:52.558
- Bitch, I am the number one
Lizzo impersonator here in LA.

24:52.558 --> 24:53.959
I coined that title myself.

24:53.959 --> 24:55.094
So baby, I'm excited.

24:55.094 --> 24:57.429
- Oh, and a gentle reminder.

24:57.429 --> 25:00.733
That tomorrow, I will be asking
one of you

25:00.733 --> 25:03.535
to sashay away.

25:03.535 --> 25:06.438
Because I am 100% that bitch.

25:06.438 --> 25:07.873
(all laughing)

25:07.873 --> 25:10.509
- Lizzo is literally about to be
sitting

25:10.509 --> 25:11.343
right in front of me.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.112
I'm gonna be spitting bars

25:13.112 --> 25:14.847
in front of one of my biggest
idols.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.582
So, no pressure, girl.

25:16.582 --> 25:17.883
No pressure at all.

25:18.951 --> 25:21.687
(upbeat electronic music)

25:21.687 --> 25:23.088
- It's a new day, people.

25:23.088 --> 25:26.024
Let's get to it!
(popping mouth)

25:26.024 --> 25:26.859
- It's time to hurry up

25:26.859 --> 25:28.727
and get ready for this talent
show

25:28.727 --> 25:30.362
extravaganza, darling.

25:30.362 --> 25:31.764
- Time to paint.

25:31.764 --> 25:33.065
- I am thrilled and I am very
excited.

25:33.065 --> 25:35.534
There's a few butterflies in my
stomach.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.369
No tea, no Asia O'Hara.

25:37.369 --> 25:39.104
I gotta get my spirit together.

25:39.104 --> 25:41.507
- [Kerri] Ooh, hey
where'd you get that from?

25:41.507 --> 25:42.841
- Girl, I brought my own smudge.

25:42.841 --> 25:44.977
This is some sage spray,
'cause of the spirits.

25:44.977 --> 25:45.811
(laughing)

25:45.811 --> 25:47.179
Bitches like to bring demons,
hoe!

25:47.179 --> 25:48.914
- The demons run from that,
child.

25:48.914 --> 25:50.916
(laughing)
(upbeat music)

25:50.916 --> 25:54.386
- Babies, how are we
feeling about talent show?

25:54.386 --> 25:56.722
- Super excited, ready, you
know.

25:56.722 --> 25:57.556
- Yass.
- Good to be me.

25:57.556 --> 25:58.857
- So are you playing any
instruments?

25:58.857 --> 26:01.326
Is that what's happening?
- Yeah, I play the guitar.

26:01.326 --> 26:02.327
I love rock and roll.
(rock music)

26:02.327 --> 26:03.662
I think this rock and roll,

26:03.662 --> 26:06.532
kind of think metally,
you know, ra la la la la.

26:06.532 --> 26:07.699
So it's very different.

26:07.699 --> 26:08.767
And you, how are you feeling?

26:08.767 --> 26:10.469
- I'm feeling really cute about
my act.

26:10.469 --> 26:12.538
I'm very comfortable with the
routine,

26:12.538 --> 26:14.940
but there's a lot of moving
parts.

26:14.940 --> 26:16.308
For the talent show,
(lively music)

26:16.308 --> 26:18.343
I will be doing burlesque.

26:18.343 --> 26:20.879
Something that I really
like to do with my act

26:20.879 --> 26:25.884
is combine sexy with a
little bit of stupid.

26:25.884 --> 26:27.519
It like really cements the fact

26:27.519 --> 26:28.954
that I'm in on the joke.

26:28.954 --> 26:31.557
There's eventually gonna
be, like, 14 of us.

26:31.557 --> 26:34.526
What can we do right now
to catch their attention?

26:34.526 --> 26:37.529
This is my chance to set the
pace

26:37.529 --> 26:38.697
for this set of girls.

26:40.566 --> 26:42.501
(upbeat music)

26:42.501 --> 26:44.169
- You're from Texas originally,
yeah.

26:44.169 --> 26:45.737
- I'm from Dallas, Texas.

26:45.737 --> 26:47.139
- Hold on, bitch, 'cause
Miss Bread is up here

26:47.139 --> 26:48.373
doing something with these
brows.

26:48.373 --> 26:49.675
(laughing)

26:49.675 --> 26:52.044
- Kornbread makes me feel so
comfortable.

26:52.044 --> 26:53.879
We bring out the Auntie in each
other.

26:53.879 --> 26:56.615
- We met in the little bar,
honey.

26:56.615 --> 26:57.649
Kiki-ing with each other.

26:57.649 --> 26:58.484
- We did.

26:58.484 --> 27:00.319
There was a night in LA

27:00.319 --> 27:02.187
that we were both hosting at a
club,

27:02.187 --> 27:03.021
and very quickly I was like,

27:03.021 --> 27:06.492
this bitch is like from my same
galaxy.

27:06.492 --> 27:08.327
It touched my spirit.
- Yeah.

27:08.327 --> 27:10.062
- It was one of those
spirit-touching moments, you
know?

27:10.062 --> 27:11.129
- You know I'm a spirit hoe.

27:11.129 --> 27:13.065
- Baby, me too.

27:13.065 --> 27:14.333
It took me coming to LA

27:14.333 --> 27:16.735
and learning that the south
needs Jesus,

27:16.735 --> 27:17.569
even though they think they-

27:17.569 --> 27:19.004
- Even though they think, baby.

27:19.004 --> 27:19.838
- They think they have Jesus,

27:19.838 --> 27:22.174
but I don't know what
kind of Jesus they got.

27:22.174 --> 27:23.909
- [Kornbread] I grew
up in the church scene,

27:23.909 --> 27:24.810
very much.
- Same.

27:24.810 --> 27:26.512
- I remember when I
was in church one time,

27:26.512 --> 27:29.515
and the pastor brought me
up in front of everybody.

27:29.515 --> 27:30.449
- Oh, they love to embarrass.

27:30.449 --> 27:32.551
- It was terrible.
- They put on a show.

27:32.551 --> 27:34.520
- And he was like, pushing my
stomach.

27:34.520 --> 27:36.655
And was like, "you got a
lot of demons" and all this bull
shit.

27:36.655 --> 27:37.756
It was like, pushing me, bitch.

27:37.756 --> 27:39.558
And I'm just like, you're trying
it.

27:39.558 --> 27:41.226
But I am a very petty human
being here.

27:41.226 --> 27:43.095
So he was just pushing
and pushing and pushing.

27:43.095 --> 27:44.162
And bitch, I let out a demon,

27:44.162 --> 27:45.464
and I farted right on his ass.

27:45.464 --> 27:46.798
(laughing)

27:46.798 --> 27:50.068
I (beep) you not.

27:50.068 --> 27:52.638
- Wait, wait.
(laughing)

27:52.638 --> 27:53.572
- Because he was pushing me.

27:53.572 --> 27:55.607
- I am so glad you did that,
though.

27:55.607 --> 27:56.508
- Absolutely, 'cause you can
kiss my ass.

27:56.508 --> 27:59.144
You're not about to make
me feel no kind of way.

27:59.144 --> 28:03.081
(upbeat music)
(siren wailing)

28:03.081 --> 28:04.249
- [RuPaul] Ooh, girl!

28:04.249 --> 28:05.817
She done already done had
herses.

28:05.817 --> 28:07.819
- You've got to be kidding me.

28:07.819 --> 28:09.321
- Is that RuMail I hear?

28:09.321 --> 28:11.256
I'm like, mm-mm, something ain't
right.

28:11.256 --> 28:12.491
- Oh my god.

28:12.491 --> 28:15.127
Rig the Morris.
(suspenseful music)

28:15.127 --> 28:18.297
- Hey Queens, it's me, Lizzo.
(Queens wailing)

28:18.297 --> 28:21.400
Look over there!
(suspenseful music)

28:21.400 --> 28:24.603
Hi my Queens!
(queens screaming)

28:24.603 --> 28:25.437
Hi y'all!

28:26.838 --> 28:28.974
It's me, Lizzo!
- I know, bitch!

28:28.974 --> 28:31.643
- I can't believe Lizzo's
in front of my face,

28:31.643 --> 28:34.346
and I look so half-baked.

28:35.347 --> 28:36.348
- I went rogue.

28:36.348 --> 28:37.783
I don't have much time.

28:37.783 --> 28:40.285
Congratulations, first of all.
- [All] Thank you!

28:40.285 --> 28:42.254
- Welcome to RuPaul's Drag Race.

28:42.254 --> 28:44.122
Your life is about to change
forever.

28:44.122 --> 28:45.457
So just embrace it.

28:45.457 --> 28:46.391
Soak it up.

28:46.391 --> 28:47.859
Be a mother fucking star.

28:47.859 --> 28:50.429
Oop, I mean a mother-tucking
star.

28:50.429 --> 28:51.496
(all laughing)

28:51.496 --> 28:53.231
And show these bitches who's

28:53.231 --> 28:54.533
Now who gonna win?

28:54.533 --> 28:55.367

28:55.367 --> 28:56.668
- One more time, when I say who
gonna win,

28:56.668 --> 28:58.303
I need you to say mother (beep)
me!

28:58.303 --> 28:59.605
- Okay.

28:59.605 --> 29:02.140
- [All] Mother (beep) me!

29:02.140 --> 29:03.308
- Okay bitch, I believe you.

29:03.308 --> 29:05.277
I felt that in my Shonda, right
here.

29:05.277 --> 29:06.111
(all laughing)

29:06.111 --> 29:08.046
I felt it in my Shonda
Rhimes right down here.

29:08.046 --> 29:09.781
You like this dress?
- Yeah!

29:09.781 --> 29:11.483
- You get the front, you get the
back.

29:11.483 --> 29:13.051
(all cheering)

29:13.051 --> 29:15.153
You get the mother (beep) snack.

29:15.153 --> 29:15.988
Well, I love y'all.

29:15.988 --> 29:17.322
I gotta go, 'cause they gonna
find my ass,

29:17.322 --> 29:18.357
I'm gonna be in trouble, okay?

29:18.357 --> 29:19.791
- Bye!
- Bye Lizzo!

29:19.791 --> 29:20.692
- Love you!
- Thank you, hoe.

29:20.692 --> 29:22.027
Don't look at my ass.

29:22.027 --> 29:23.762
- Shake your little ass, ya!

29:23.762 --> 29:27.299
Throw it back!
(all laughing)

29:27.299 --> 29:28.934
- Bye!

29:28.934 --> 29:29.768
- Yes.
- Oh my god.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.336
- Bitch, her body is everything.

29:31.336 --> 29:34.272
- Lizzo just fired us the (beep)
up,

29:34.272 --> 29:35.907
and the energy in the room now

29:35.907 --> 29:37.743
is definitely a lot more hype.

29:37.743 --> 29:38.877
- That just literally woke me
up, bitch.

29:38.877 --> 29:40.445
I am ready to go.
- Yes.

29:40.445 --> 29:42.514
- We are giving you America's
Got Talent,

29:42.514 --> 29:43.649
but like, remix that,

29:43.649 --> 29:45.784
that's Ru-merica's Got Talent.

29:45.784 --> 29:48.654
Every bitch is bringing a
strong contending talent.

29:48.654 --> 29:50.355
We have an African dance,

29:50.355 --> 29:52.624
we have a rock and roll session.

29:52.624 --> 29:55.127
Bosco, chicken and waffles,

29:55.127 --> 29:57.462

burlesque number.

29:57.462 --> 30:00.298
Willow, I'm not sure what Willow
is doing.

30:01.566 --> 30:04.169
But, it's gonna be a good
show to watch, America.

30:04.169 --> 30:06.872
- I'm gonna have to make it good
as hell.

30:06.872 --> 30:09.875

32:02.454 --> 32:05.390
Michelle, what'd you think
of my new song, "Catwalk?"

32:05.390 --> 32:08.226
- That was great! Do it again!

32:08.226 --> 32:11.062
- Shut up.
(laughing)

32:11.062 --> 32:13.365
The hilarious Ross Mathews.

32:13.365 --> 32:15.700
Are you enjoying my big opening?

32:15.700 --> 32:16.835
- Oh Ru, I'm flattered.

32:16.835 --> 32:18.470
And you know I love a big
opening.

32:18.470 --> 32:19.938
But, I'm taken.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.406
- You're engaged!
(clapping)

32:21.406 --> 32:22.240
Mazel tov!
- Yay!

32:22.240 --> 32:24.743
- Thank you.
- Oh that's fabulous.

32:24.743 --> 32:25.710
- Thank you.

32:25.710 --> 32:28.146
- And the incredible Lizzo.

32:28.146 --> 32:30.315
I heard you snuck into the Werk
Room.

32:30.315 --> 32:32.751
- Oh, all the Ru-mors are true,
Ru.

32:32.751 --> 32:34.052
(all laughing)

32:34.052 --> 32:35.053
You see what I did there?

32:35.053 --> 32:37.989
- Well, I sure hope my girls
were decent.

32:37.989 --> 32:39.758

43:04.182 --> 43:05.983
so you definitely can peep the
lions.

43:05.983 --> 43:09.854
They are stoned out because
I am all about that drama.

43:09.854 --> 43:12.790
I'm feeling my rich bitch
fantasy.

43:12.790 --> 43:14.525
I'm just giving you everything
you need.

43:14.525 --> 43:16.627
I'm warming you up on a Winter
evening.

43:16.627 --> 43:18.396
- Bye Fur-licia.

43:18.396 --> 43:21.232
(judges laughing)

43:22.800 --> 43:24.268
Orion Story.

43:24.268 --> 43:26.337
- [Michelle] Somebody get
her some Benadryl, please.

43:26.337 --> 43:27.271
(judges laugh)

43:27.271 --> 43:29.073
- [Orion] This look is me to a
T.

43:29.073 --> 43:32.143
I saw this fabric, and I thought
mushroom.

43:32.143 --> 43:35.913
I rip off my mushroom cape.
(judges laughing)

43:35.913 --> 43:39.584
And I have my three breasts
exposed.

43:39.584 --> 43:42.153
I really just want to give the
judges

43:42.153 --> 43:46.424
a full, sexy, weird cartoon
fantasy.

43:46.424 --> 43:48.092
- [RuPaul] Well, you know what
they say,

43:48.092 --> 43:49.594
third boob's a charm.

43:49.594 --> 43:51.762
(judges laughing)

43:51.762 --> 43:52.630
I hope you're hungry.

43:52.630 --> 43:55.967
Kornbread with a K.

43:55.967 --> 43:57.702
- [Michelle] Uh, Lizzo?

43:57.702 --> 43:58.736
(Lizzo laughing)

43:58.736 --> 44:00.338
She coming for your gig, girl.

44:00.338 --> 44:02.273
- Yeah yeah, bitch stole my
look.

44:02.273 --> 44:03.774
(laughing)

44:03.774 --> 44:05.209
- [Kornbread] Right
now, the Bread done put

44:05.209 --> 44:06.911
the menu on the table, honey.

44:06.911 --> 44:08.613
A lot of people tell you as a
big person,

44:08.613 --> 44:09.947
you need to cover yourself up.

44:09.947 --> 44:11.616
Baby, I'm letting it all hang
out.

44:11.616 --> 44:14.452
My drag is fat, Black, and
uncomfortable.

44:14.452 --> 44:16.988
And I am every last one
of those things right now.

44:16.988 --> 44:17.822
- [Lizzo] Where the hood,

44:17.822 --> 44:19.490
where the hood, where the hood
at?

44:19.490 --> 44:21.859
(judges laughing)

44:21.859 --> 44:23.928
- [RuPaul] She's not a big pill.

44:23.928 --> 44:24.929
She's a Willow Pill.

44:26.797 --> 44:28.566
- [Ross] This queen is
still a little green.

44:28.566 --> 44:30.001
- [Willow] I wanted to do a look

44:30.001 --> 44:32.737
that has a little bit
of Willow in all of it.

44:32.737 --> 44:36.374
It's colorful, and it's that
perfect combo of glamor,

44:36.374 --> 44:38.643
with just a touch of ugly.

44:38.643 --> 44:41.345
- [RuPaul] Hey Willow,
how's your head phones?

44:41.345 --> 44:44.415
(judges gently laughing)
♪ The world is your runway ♪

44:44.415 --> 44:45.249
(suspenseful music)

44:45.249 --> 44:46.250
Welcome, ladies.

44:46.250 --> 44:50.154
You are here because you are
great.

44:50.154 --> 44:53.991
And tonight, all of you
were very enter-taint-ing.

44:53.991 --> 44:56.060
And if you want to win,

44:56.060 --> 44:57.562
you'll take our notes,

44:57.562 --> 44:58.996
and continue to grow.

45:00.031 --> 45:02.500
Now it's time for the judges'
critiques.

45:02.500 --> 45:05.970
Up first, June Jambalaya.
(upbeat dance music)

45:05.970 --> 45:08.205
- You came out and showed us
you have something to say.

45:08.205 --> 45:09.307
And I thought it was beautiful.

45:09.307 --> 45:10.541
- I thought it was meaningful.

45:10.541 --> 45:12.176
But we were focusing on your
headband

45:12.176 --> 45:13.911
that was falling down over your
eyes.

45:13.911 --> 45:16.847
We saw, I think, control
top panty hose underneath.

45:16.847 --> 45:18.616
Were there shorts on under
there?

45:18.616 --> 45:19.784
- It was biker shorts.

45:19.784 --> 45:20.985
- Also, tonight on the runway,

45:20.985 --> 45:23.788
I can see the dark shorts
on under this as well.

45:23.788 --> 45:24.622
- Tights.

45:24.622 --> 45:26.591
- Make sure you watch
those little details.

45:26.591 --> 45:28.759
The finishing touches
are gonna matter, June.

45:28.759 --> 45:30.194
So think about those things.

45:31.095 --> 45:33.097
- Are you having a moment right
now?

45:33.097 --> 45:35.299
When you walked out here, I felt
you.

45:35.299 --> 45:37.401
When you bring culture into your
talent,

45:37.401 --> 45:38.736
it makes me want to know more
about you.

45:38.736 --> 45:40.371
You and your pussy willows you
had on.

45:40.371 --> 45:42.206
Were those pussy willows?

45:42.206 --> 45:43.708
- Girl, I don't know what it
was.

45:43.708 --> 45:45.543
I asked for a little jungle
feel.

45:45.543 --> 45:47.078
I said, a little Coming to
America.

45:47.078 --> 45:50.548
- A little Coming to America.
(all laughing)

45:50.548 --> 45:52.516
Well keep bringing the pussy
willows.

45:52.516 --> 45:53.718
You're a beautiful soul.

45:53.718 --> 45:55.353
- Thank you so much.

45:55.353 --> 45:57.588
- Up next, we've got Bosco.

45:57.588 --> 45:58.823
- I love the name Bosco.

45:58.823 --> 46:00.791
- Thank you.
- My drag name is Costco.

46:00.791 --> 46:02.059
- Oh!
(laughing)

46:02.059 --> 46:05.229
- I love burlesque because
it's always so playful.

46:05.229 --> 46:07.164
Removing a petal at a time.

46:07.164 --> 46:08.633
You know, he loves me, he loves
me not,

46:08.633 --> 46:10.701
was just so whimsical.

46:10.701 --> 46:13.537
- You've got glamor, you've
got fashion, you've got beauty.

46:13.537 --> 46:15.906
You know how like,
Marilyn Monroe was like,

46:15.906 --> 46:17.008
the face of a generation,

46:17.008 --> 46:19.777
but she was also like a
fucking comedic genius?

46:19.777 --> 46:23.714
That is that spark that
I kind of see in you.

46:23.714 --> 46:24.548
You're great.

46:24.548 --> 46:25.983
You made my earring fall
off, bitch. I like you.

46:25.983 --> 46:27.351
- Is that Bluetooth?

46:27.351 --> 46:29.153
(all laughing)

46:29.153 --> 46:30.254
- Can you hear me now?

46:31.689 --> 46:34.125
- Up next, Alyssa Hunter.
(upbeat music)

46:34.125 --> 46:34.959
- Hola.

46:34.959 --> 46:36.994
- I love that you did a rock
song.

46:36.994 --> 46:38.362
- Thank you.
- I thought it was just

46:38.362 --> 46:40.264
something we don't see a lot
here.

46:40.264 --> 46:43.134
- It was, however, a bit one
note.

46:43.134 --> 46:45.403
I just think it was a little
flat.

46:45.403 --> 46:48.739
- You look fucking incredible
right now.

46:48.739 --> 46:50.174
- Thank you, baby.
- But I thought I knew

46:50.174 --> 46:51.575
who you were, and now I'm like,

46:51.575 --> 46:54.378
I don't know who the fuck you
are.

46:54.378 --> 46:56.447
- Your number should have been
designed

46:56.447 --> 46:58.649
to get to know who you are and
go,

46:58.649 --> 47:00.618
ah, I know that girl.

47:00.618 --> 47:02.119
And I love that girl.

47:02.119 --> 47:03.621
That's what we're looking for.

47:04.488 --> 47:06.524
Up next, Kerri Colby.

47:06.524 --> 47:07.358
- Howdy.

47:07.358 --> 47:08.192
- When you came out,

47:08.192 --> 47:09.026
and you were doing Nicki Minaj,

47:09.026 --> 47:10.628
you were just lip syncing,
right?

47:10.628 --> 47:12.530
As soon as you picked up the
jump rope,

47:12.530 --> 47:14.465
that was next level.

47:14.465 --> 47:16.934
I wish you would've gotten
to it a little sooner.

47:16.934 --> 47:18.169
- Yeah.
- It was really impressive.

47:18.169 --> 47:20.271
I just wanted you to go full
stupid.

47:20.271 --> 47:22.273
To let yourself go.
- Okay.

47:22.273 --> 47:24.008
- I really liked the look today,

47:24.008 --> 47:25.242
because it's branding.

47:25.242 --> 47:27.278
And that's what this is, is a
billboard.

47:27.278 --> 47:28.279
I know that you're Kerri,

47:28.279 --> 47:30.181
because K-K-K-K-K-K.
(all laughing)

47:30.181 --> 47:33.317
- I'm glad you got a lot
of Ks, 'cause, (laughing),

47:33.317 --> 47:36.020
baby, if it was just three of
'em.

47:36.020 --> 47:38.622
(all laughing)

47:40.124 --> 47:41.592
- Thank you, Kerri.
- Thank you.

47:41.592 --> 47:43.661
- [RuPaul] Up next, Orion Story.

47:43.661 --> 47:44.495
- Me?

47:44.495 --> 47:46.731
- You make me very
uncomfortable.

47:46.731 --> 47:48.699
(all laughing)

47:48.699 --> 47:50.267
I don't know what's happening.

47:50.267 --> 47:51.836
Three titties?

47:51.836 --> 47:52.670
- Which one?

47:52.670 --> 47:55.106
- No! Please, I'm
already triggered enough.

47:55.106 --> 47:56.307
(all laughing)

47:56.307 --> 47:58.342
- She's triggered by the boobs.

47:58.342 --> 47:59.343
I'm triggered by,

47:59.343 --> 48:01.412
look like you've been picking
cotton.

48:01.412 --> 48:02.246
(shady music)
(all exclaiming)

48:02.246 --> 48:06.717
- Ru!
(Lizzo wailing, RuPaul laughs)

48:06.717 --> 48:09.153
Let's talk about your character.

48:09.153 --> 48:10.488
First of all, I want to give you
credit

48:10.488 --> 48:13.424
for attempting to do something
different.

48:13.424 --> 48:16.127
I think it needs to be work
shopped a little bit more.

48:17.228 --> 48:19.163
- You've got the fearlessness,

48:19.163 --> 48:20.865
and so it's just about the
structure.

48:20.865 --> 48:23.400
You gotta have joke after
joke after joke after joke.

48:23.400 --> 48:24.401
And they gotta land.

48:25.669 --> 48:28.439
- Up next, it's Kornbread with a
K.

48:28.439 --> 48:29.774
- Tonight, listen.

48:29.774 --> 48:32.143
The look itself is really
beautiful.

48:32.143 --> 48:33.944
You chose to go
bald-headed with a wrap on,

48:33.944 --> 48:34.779
which I love.
- Yeah.

48:34.779 --> 48:37.548
- But I think this needs
some kind of height.

48:37.548 --> 48:40.251
- Okay.
- Because it squashes you.

48:40.251 --> 48:42.253
So what you want to do is
proportion-ize.

48:42.253 --> 48:44.555
Also, there are some
holes in your fishnets.

48:44.555 --> 48:47.224
So we gotta watch those things
and think about details.

48:47.224 --> 48:48.058
- Yes, ma'am.

48:48.058 --> 48:50.928
- Let's talk about what
I'm assuming is your song.

48:50.928 --> 48:51.762
- Yes.

48:51.762 --> 48:54.131
- The problem for me was I
couldn't understand a lot of it.

48:54.131 --> 48:54.965
- Okay.

48:54.965 --> 48:56.634
- We're getting every fifth or
sixth word.

48:56.634 --> 48:59.603
- Don't be coming for my girl,
Kornbread!

48:59.603 --> 49:03.040
I understood everything you
said.

49:03.040 --> 49:04.608
I loved the song.

49:04.608 --> 49:05.743
You were funny as hell.

49:05.743 --> 49:07.378
- Thank you.
- Listen.

49:07.378 --> 49:09.146
I speak Black folks.
(laughing)

49:09.146 --> 49:11.415
And I think I understood
it a little bit more

49:11.415 --> 49:13.417
than what Michelle was
understanding.

49:13.417 --> 49:16.453
- You're a superstar.

49:16.453 --> 49:18.856
(music cuts)

49:18.856 --> 49:20.758
- What are you feeling?
(dramatic music)

49:20.758 --> 49:23.494
- This has been a dream
of mine for the longest,

49:23.494 --> 49:27.498
and I'm not a person
that cries, I'm a thug.

49:27.498 --> 49:28.632
(laughing)

49:28.632 --> 49:30.167
I'm not a person that cries like
that.

49:30.167 --> 49:32.436
But it's just like
there's so much happening,

49:32.436 --> 49:33.838
and in the best way possible.

49:33.838 --> 49:35.439
- You're getting confirmation of
something

49:35.439 --> 49:37.575
that you already knew your whole
life.

49:37.575 --> 49:38.409
- Preach.
- But other people

49:38.409 --> 49:39.243
couldn't see it.

49:39.243 --> 49:40.477
Now you're in a place where
people

49:40.477 --> 49:44.915
can actually see what
makes you so fantastic.

49:44.915 --> 49:45.816
Well done tonight.

49:45.816 --> 49:47.318
- Thank you.

49:47.318 --> 49:52.289
- Up next, not big pill, Willow
Pill.

49:52.623 --> 49:55.459
- This isn't my favorite look up
here.

49:55.459 --> 49:57.461
I don't like the Kermit the Frog
hands.

49:57.461 --> 49:58.562
(laughing)

49:58.562 --> 50:00.631
- Like, my skin is crawling
even looking at you

50:00.631 --> 50:03.100
with this color on your body.
(all laughing)

50:03.100 --> 50:03.934
It's like-

50:04.935 --> 50:07.004
But I thought your talent

50:08.038 --> 50:11.775
was so fun.
(upbeat music)

50:11.775 --> 50:13.444
- I still couldn't tell you

50:14.311 --> 50:16.280
what I saw.

50:16.280 --> 50:18.716
But I love that you brought it
here.

50:18.716 --> 50:20.251
You got me hooked.

50:20.251 --> 50:21.318
- What does Oprah say?

50:21.318 --> 50:22.286
I got it.

50:22.286 --> 50:24.255
And I fucking loved it.

50:25.155 --> 50:27.258
I come from that world of drag.

50:27.258 --> 50:29.860
You are incredible.

50:29.860 --> 50:31.896
You showed us the absurdity

50:31.896 --> 50:35.866
of all of the things
people take so seriously.

50:35.866 --> 50:37.501
You told me about throughout
your life,

50:37.501 --> 50:39.470
you've had health issues.

50:39.470 --> 50:41.572
- I have gone through kidney
failure,

50:41.572 --> 50:44.608
and dialysis and transplants.

50:44.608 --> 50:48.846
But sometimes I feel
like I'm just swallowed

50:49.947 --> 50:53.017
in the darkness that's in my
head.

50:53.017 --> 50:57.254
And to translate it into humor,

50:57.254 --> 50:58.923
and have you understand,

51:00.190 --> 51:01.859
that just means everything to
me.

51:01.859 --> 51:03.127
- You are here today,

51:03.127 --> 51:07.464
living proof that laughter is
the answer.

51:07.464 --> 51:09.266
I'm very proud of you.

51:09.266 --> 51:10.668
- Thank you.

51:10.668 --> 51:11.635
- Thank you, ladies.

51:11.635 --> 51:13.070
I think we've heard enough.

51:13.070 --> 51:15.306
While you untuck in the Werk
Room,

51:15.306 --> 51:17.541
the judges and I will
deliberate.

51:17.541 --> 51:18.509
(engine revving)

51:18.509 --> 51:20.377
Alright now just between
us squirrel friends,

51:20.377 --> 51:21.679
what do you think?

51:21.679 --> 51:23.380
Starting with June Jambalaya.

51:23.380 --> 51:24.448
- I like June.

51:24.448 --> 51:26.483
She has heart, she has depth.

51:26.483 --> 51:29.720
Yes, there's a lot of
polish that needs to happen.

51:29.720 --> 51:30.788
- She brought her dancing skills

51:30.788 --> 51:32.256
and her culture to this
challenge,

51:32.256 --> 51:33.457
but when it comes to details,

51:33.457 --> 51:35.225
she's gotta step her pussy
willows up.

51:35.225 --> 51:36.827
(all laughing)

51:36.827 --> 51:37.661
- That's true.

51:38.562 --> 51:39.563
- Amen.

51:39.563 --> 51:40.431
- [RuPaul] Bosco.

51:40.431 --> 51:42.666
- Whereas June needs to pay
more attention to the details,

51:42.666 --> 51:45.636
I feel like Bosco has details on
point.

51:45.636 --> 51:47.371
- And she funny, y'all.
- Mm-hmm.

51:47.371 --> 51:48.906
- She funny, uh oh.

51:48.906 --> 51:50.074
I'm scared.
(laughing)

51:50.074 --> 51:51.976
- And she's definitely got her
eye

51:51.976 --> 51:54.144
on the fashion part of drag.

51:54.144 --> 51:57.114
So she's gonna be a
really fun one to watch.

51:57.114 --> 51:59.383
- [RuPaul] Alyssa Hunter from
Puerto Rico.

51:59.383 --> 52:00.784
- The juxtaposition between

52:00.784 --> 52:02.953
the talent show and the runway,

52:02.953 --> 52:05.789
probably more confusing than
the toaster for me tonight.

52:05.789 --> 52:08.392
(all laughing)

52:08.392 --> 52:09.693
Understand the assignment

52:09.693 --> 52:10.794
and have a through line.

52:10.794 --> 52:11.996
- Tonight on the runway,
however,

52:11.996 --> 52:13.564
she looked gorgeous, she sold
it,

52:13.564 --> 52:17.501
and I hope more of that is what
turns up.

52:17.501 --> 52:18.669
- [RuPaul] Kerri Colby.

52:18.669 --> 52:21.238
- When she picked up that
jump rope, it was on.

52:21.238 --> 52:23.474
She is so good at that,

52:23.474 --> 52:26.043
and I love when we're
surprised by talents.

52:26.043 --> 52:27.111
- What she should've had done

52:27.111 --> 52:29.279
was come out here with the
jump rope from the gag.

52:29.279 --> 52:30.180
- Yeah.
- Because that's when

52:30.180 --> 52:31.648
it was interesting.

52:31.648 --> 52:33.217
- [RuPaul] Orion Story.
(upbeat music)

52:33.217 --> 52:34.718
- This was a bit awkward
tonight.

52:34.718 --> 52:35.853
- Ha!
- What it was

52:35.853 --> 52:37.988
was this character workshop
thing

52:37.988 --> 52:39.323
that we all were part of.

52:39.323 --> 52:41.592
She could be something very
special,

52:41.592 --> 52:44.028
but, I mean, we're here.

52:44.028 --> 52:45.095
- Now is the time.

52:45.095 --> 52:47.064
- Time to let the hot
one out of the chamber.

52:47.064 --> 52:48.432
(laughing)

52:48.432 --> 52:50.300
- [RuPaul] Kornbread with a K.

52:50.300 --> 52:52.770
- Kornbread might be one of the
most

52:52.770 --> 52:55.672
naturally funny people
I've ever been around.

52:55.672 --> 52:58.776
All I saw was a supernova in
front of me.

52:58.776 --> 53:00.644
- Kornbread delivered.
- Amen.

53:00.644 --> 53:02.046
- Hot corn, Jiffy corn bread,

53:02.046 --> 53:04.281
with some syrup and butter,
honey.

53:04.281 --> 53:07.418
Kornbread is a star.

53:07.418 --> 53:08.685
Willow Pill.

53:08.685 --> 53:10.320
- She gave us performance art.

53:10.320 --> 53:11.822
- All we can ask ourselves at
this point

53:11.822 --> 53:13.157
is if we wanna see more.

53:13.157 --> 53:15.759
Bitch, yes I want to see more
from her.

53:15.759 --> 53:16.960
- She breaks the fourth wall

53:16.960 --> 53:19.263
of what humans are doing on this
planet.

53:19.263 --> 53:20.631
It's the exact same thing

53:20.631 --> 53:23.834
that Monty Python's Flying
Circus did.

53:23.834 --> 53:25.502
They did mundane things,

53:25.502 --> 53:28.038
and they made fun of everything
else

53:28.038 --> 53:29.573
that we all take seriously.

53:29.573 --> 53:30.941
I love her!

53:32.342 --> 53:33.210
(claps twice)

53:33.210 --> 53:34.511
Silence.

53:34.511 --> 53:36.280
RuPaul, I've heard enough.

53:36.280 --> 53:40.017
(all laughing)
(lively music)

53:40.017 --> 53:41.518
- I'm so confused.

53:44.354 --> 53:46.156
- Well.
- Bring back my girls.

53:46.156 --> 53:47.257
(engine revs)
(dramatic music)

53:47.257 --> 53:48.892
Welcome back, ladies.

53:48.892 --> 53:50.594
I've made some decisions.

53:50.594 --> 53:52.729
(dramatic music)

53:52.729 --> 53:55.432
Bosco, Willow Pill.

53:57.167 --> 53:58.001
You are safe.

53:59.736 --> 54:01.638
You may step to the back of the
stage.

54:04.141 --> 54:06.910
Kornbread, I've got one thing to
say.

54:08.579 --> 54:10.714
Winner winner, chicken necklace.

54:11.648 --> 54:13.617
(laughing)

54:13.617 --> 54:14.952
Con-drag-ulations, you are the
winner

54:14.952 --> 54:16.220
of this week's challenge.
(all clapping)

54:16.220 --> 54:19.423
- Oh god fuck yeah!

54:19.423 --> 54:22.626
- You've won a cash prize of
$5000.

54:22.626 --> 54:24.428
- Oh bitch better have my money!

54:26.930 --> 54:27.998
Bitch, what the fuck?

54:27.998 --> 54:29.266
I just won the first challenge

54:29.266 --> 54:30.100
of RuPaul's Drag Race.

54:30.100 --> 54:31.435
I'm on top of the world.

54:31.435 --> 54:34.271
Wow.
(all laughing)

54:36.006 --> 54:37.908
(dramatic music)

54:37.908 --> 54:39.009
- Kerri Colby.

54:40.577 --> 54:42.579
You are safe.

54:42.579 --> 54:43.413
- Thank you.

54:45.015 --> 54:47.184
(suspenseful music)

54:47.184 --> 54:48.785
- June Jambalaya.

54:48.785 --> 54:50.754
Your dance was beautiful,

54:50.754 --> 54:53.724
but the details got lost in the
weeds.

54:55.125 --> 54:56.660
Alyssa Hunter,

54:56.660 --> 54:58.462
your fashion was glam,

54:58.462 --> 55:01.999
but your performance did not
rock.

55:03.200 --> 55:06.670
Orion Story, you have a lot of
potential,

55:06.670 --> 55:11.108
but your comedy routine
just didn't work out.

55:11.108 --> 55:14.344
(dramatic music)

55:14.344 --> 55:15.312
Alyssa Hunter,

55:18.182 --> 55:19.716
you are safe.

55:21.718 --> 55:24.488
(dramatic music)

55:27.191 --> 55:28.559
- Thank you very much.

55:28.559 --> 55:30.260
- You may join the other girls.

55:30.260 --> 55:31.094
- Thank you.

55:33.830 --> 55:37.501
- June Jambalaya, Orion Story.

55:37.501 --> 55:39.002
I'm sorry my dears,

55:39.002 --> 55:41.038
but you are up for elimination.

55:42.639 --> 55:46.877
- I refuse to let this be the
end.

55:46.877 --> 55:47.711
Oh no, ma'am.

55:48.579 --> 55:52.249
- Two queens stand before me.
(suspenseful music)

55:52.249 --> 55:54.017
I've consulted with the judges,

55:54.017 --> 55:56.820
but the final decision is mine
to make.

55:57.821 --> 55:59.089
Prior to tonight,

55:59.089 --> 56:02.159
you were asked to prepare
a lip sync performance

56:02.159 --> 56:05.195
of "Water Me" by Lizzo.

56:05.195 --> 56:09.866
Ladies, this is your last
chance to impress me,

56:09.866 --> 56:13.370
and save yourself from
elimination.

56:13.370 --> 56:14.938
(suspenseful music)

56:14.938 --> 56:16.773
The time has come
(thunder rumbling)

56:16.773 --> 56:18.942
for you to lip sync

56:20.677 --> 56:24.147
for your life!

56:25.249 --> 56:26.984
(suspenseful music)

56:26.984 --> 56:29.353
- I'm gonna turn out this
lip sync the way I know how.

56:29.353 --> 56:30.287
Balls to the wall,

56:30.287 --> 56:33.056
and do what I know how
to do, which is perform.

56:33.056 --> 56:33.890
- Good luck,

56:35.259 --> 56:36.426
and don't fuck it up.

58:51.128 --> 58:54.131
(suspenseful music)

58:57.667 --> 59:00.137
June Jambalaya, shante you stay.

59:00.137 --> 59:02.873
(dramatic music)

59:05.575 --> 59:06.576
- Thank you.

59:08.478 --> 59:11.515
- Orion, your story is just
beginning.

59:12.749 --> 59:16.386
Now, sashay away.

59:16.386 --> 59:19.856
(clapping)
(dramatic music)

59:19.856 --> 59:23.527
- Well boots, it's time to start
walkin'.

59:23.527 --> 59:27.130
Bye, Ms. Three Titties

59:27.130 --> 59:28.465
- Love you, baby.
- We love you.

59:28.465 --> 59:29.299
- I love you.

59:30.300 --> 59:33.370
(dramatic music)

59:33.370 --> 59:37.107
- I definitely did not see
myself going home first.

59:37.107 --> 59:38.775
But I think everyone back home

59:38.775 --> 59:40.377
will be proud of what I did.

59:40.377 --> 59:42.245
I don't have a single regret.

59:42.245 --> 59:45.115
I put up a good fight,
but it wasn't enough.

59:48.251 --> 59:49.619
(exciting music)

59:49.619 --> 59:51.188
- Con-drag-ulations, ladies.

59:51.188 --> 59:53.757
Next week, it's an all new
premiere,

59:53.757 --> 59:57.160
with seven new queens
competing for the crown.

59:57.160 --> 59:58.562
Until then, remember,

59:58.562 --> 59:59.930
if you can't love yourself,

59:59.930 --> 1:00:01.932
how in the hell are you
gonna love somebody else?

1:00:01.932 --> 1:00:03.533
Can I get an amen up in here?

1:00:03.533 --> 1:00:04.835
- [All] Amen!

1:00:04.835 --> 1:00:06.870
- Alright now let the music
play!

Next time on RuPaul's Drag Race.

1:00:20.083 --> 1:00:21.218
- We survived week one,

1:00:21.218 --> 1:00:23.019
but we got some next bitches
coming up

1:00:23.019 --> 1:00:24.287
to come take our spot.

1:00:24.287 --> 1:00:26.323
- I hope y'all are hungry.

1:00:26.323 --> 1:00:27.757
To win!
(dramatic music)

1:00:27.757 --> 1:00:29.726
