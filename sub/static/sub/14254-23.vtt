WEBVTT

00:10.343 --> 00:12.311
Now these are delicious.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.614
Uh, leave some
for the rest of us.

00:15.682 --> 00:17.650
Hey, l'm eating for two.

00:19.352 --> 00:20.944
Great party, Neelix.

00:21.021 --> 00:23.819
Everybody seems
to be enjoying it.

00:23.890 --> 00:25.187
Yeah, except the Doc.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.497
Those are for eating,
not scanning.

00:32.564 --> 00:33.827
What exactly are they?

00:33.900 --> 00:35.162
Cheese pirogies.

00:35.268 --> 00:36.792
Zefram Cochrane's favorite.

00:36.903 --> 00:39.463
They have absolutely
no nutritional value.

00:39.572 --> 00:41.096
This is a party, Doctor.

00:41.207 --> 00:43.334
Sometimes you have to
forget about nutrition.

00:43.410 --> 00:45.207
You could include
a vitamin supplement

00:45.278 --> 00:46.540
when you replicate.

00:46.613 --> 00:49.673
Replicate? l made them myself.

00:49.749 --> 00:52.309
You two have outdone yourselves.

00:52.385 --> 00:55.411
l've never seen First Contact
Day celebrated quite like this.

00:55.488 --> 00:57.752
When l was your age,
all it meant was a day off

00:57.824 --> 00:59.416
from school.

00:59.492 --> 01:01.790
Well, Neelix and l thought
we should make it more fun.

01:01.861 --> 01:03.192
Well, you certainly succeeded.

01:03.263 --> 01:05.458
When is Commander Tuvok
making his presentation?

01:05.532 --> 01:08.126
Well, now's as good
a time as any.

01:08.234 --> 01:10.464
Captain.

01:10.570 --> 01:13.471
Uh, may l have everyone's
attention, please?

01:14.741 --> 01:16.936
ln honor of the 315th

01:17.010 --> 01:20.946
anniversary of his ancestors'
arrival on Earth,

01:21.047 --> 01:24.312
l've asked Mr. Tuvok to
recite the first words

01:24.384 --> 01:25.578
spoken to humans by a Vulcan.

01:27.053 --> 01:28.213
Commander?

01:30.056 --> 01:31.546
ls this really necessary?

01:31.624 --> 01:33.421
You promised.

01:35.061 --> 01:37.188
Very well.

01:37.263 --> 01:39.094
Live long and prosper.

01:39.165 --> 01:40.257
Ah.

01:43.803 --> 01:45.430
And now, for some more

01:45.538 --> 01:48.234
of Zefram Cochrane's
favorite music.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:59.652 --> 02:02.212
Hey, come on, Mr. Vulcan.

02:02.288 --> 02:05.052
Vulcans do not dance.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.888
But it's tradition.

02:06.993 --> 02:09.051
There is no tradition,
Mr. Neelix.

02:09.128 --> 02:11.654
This ceremony
is entirely your invention.

02:11.731 --> 02:14.097
This is an official
ship function, Commander.

02:14.167 --> 02:17.261
Don't make me order you
to dance.

02:17.370 --> 02:18.598
Sorry to interrupt,

02:18.705 --> 02:20.070
but l've got
some interesting news.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.607
Neelix, you might want
to hear this.

02:21.674 --> 02:22.800
Huh?

02:24.744 --> 02:27.304
Long-range sensors have detected
several hundred life signs

02:27.380 --> 02:31.646
approximately 4.9
light-years away.

02:31.718 --> 02:32.707
They're Talaxian.

04:33.506 --> 04:34.564
Are we there yet?

04:34.674 --> 04:35.606
Not exactly.

04:36.676 --> 04:38.735
The life signs appear
to be coming from inside

04:38.811 --> 04:39.937
that asteroid field.

04:40.046 --> 04:41.138
From a ship?

04:41.214 --> 04:42.875
We are not detecting
any vessels.

04:44.217 --> 04:45.809
No response from hails?

04:45.885 --> 04:47.147
Not yet.

04:47.220 --> 04:50.155
l hope they're all right.

04:50.223 --> 04:51.815
There's a lot of interference.

04:51.891 --> 04:54.621
Maybe they haven't received
our transmissions.

04:54.694 --> 04:56.127
Can we move in any closer?

04:56.195 --> 04:59.323
Voyager is too big
to maneuver safely in there.

04:59.399 --> 05:01.026
We could take the Flyer.

05:03.903 --> 05:05.803
lt wouldn't have hurt you
to do a few steps.

05:05.872 --> 05:08.204
l am trying to concentrate
on the shields, Mr. Neelix.

05:08.274 --> 05:09.832
l think you were just afraid.

05:09.942 --> 05:11.409
That's absurd.

05:11.477 --> 05:12.637
lt's understandable.

05:12.712 --> 05:14.805
There were a lot of people
watching.

05:14.881 --> 05:17.145
Vulcans don't experience fear.

05:17.216 --> 05:20.208
l'm going to make it
my personal mission

05:20.286 --> 05:21.753
to get you to dance
at least once

05:21.821 --> 05:22.810
before we reach Earth.

05:22.889 --> 05:25.483
Then l suggest you find
a more productive hobby.

05:25.558 --> 05:27.856
lf you two
don't stop it, l'm going

05:27.927 --> 05:29.724
to come back there
and separate you.

05:32.265 --> 05:33.892
l've localized the life signs.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.458
Bearing 108 mark 26.

05:37.570 --> 05:40.164
They appear to be inside
a large asteroid.

05:40.273 --> 05:41.205
lnside?

05:42.508 --> 05:43.805
What was that?

05:43.876 --> 05:45.173
A thermalyte explosive.

05:45.244 --> 05:46.643
30.6 kilometers to port.

05:46.713 --> 05:48.681
l'm detecting
another projectile,

05:48.748 --> 05:50.113
heading directly toward us.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.344
Evasive maneuvers.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.751
We've lost shields.

05:58.825 --> 06:00.884
Main propulsion is off-line.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.019
We're going to have
to make an emergency landing.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.688
Where?

06:04.764 --> 06:06.755
The Talaxians' asteroid
is the closest.

06:06.833 --> 06:09.734
The surface is covered
with craters, ice fields.

06:12.739 --> 06:13.831
We don't have a choice.

06:13.973 --> 06:15.372
Hold on.

06:39.332 --> 06:40.458
Problem?

06:40.533 --> 06:42.194
We've lost contact
with the away team.

06:42.301 --> 06:44.360
l also detected some
unusual energy discharges

06:44.470 --> 06:45.437
in the asteroid field.

06:45.505 --> 06:46.494
What kind of discharges?

06:46.606 --> 06:47.573
lt's difficult to tell

06:47.640 --> 06:49.608
because of the interference,
but they appear

06:49.709 --> 06:51.176
to be thermalytic explosions.

06:51.277 --> 06:53.302
l believe several of them
were in close

06:53.379 --> 06:55.711
proximity to the Flyer.

06:55.782 --> 06:56.874
Source?

06:56.949 --> 06:58.416
Unknown.

07:00.686 --> 07:02.677
We'll need
to send a rescue team.

07:02.755 --> 07:03.813
Work with B'Elanna.

07:03.923 --> 07:06.016
Try to modify the shields
on one of the shuttles

07:06.092 --> 07:07.650
to withstand these explosions.

07:18.070 --> 07:20.038
Stay still.

07:21.407 --> 07:23.398
Don't worry.
lt's not serious.

07:25.411 --> 07:27.436
Am l inside the asteroid?

07:27.513 --> 07:28.673
Yes.

07:28.748 --> 07:30.181
This is my home.

07:30.249 --> 07:32.410
Where are my friends?

07:32.485 --> 07:33.747
lf you mean the aliens

07:33.820 --> 07:36.448
who were on the ship with you,
they're safe.

07:38.090 --> 07:39.580
l'd like to see them.

07:39.659 --> 07:41.456
You need to rest.

07:46.098 --> 07:48.396
What were you doing
in the asteroid field?

07:50.036 --> 07:51.503
Looking for you.

07:52.805 --> 07:56.070
Well, not you s-specifically,

07:56.142 --> 07:59.202
but my ship
detected Talaxians.

07:59.278 --> 08:02.441
l haven't come across
any in years, so...

08:03.683 --> 08:05.173
l'm sorry.

08:05.251 --> 08:06.912
l'm Neelix.

08:06.986 --> 08:08.613
Dexa.

08:08.688 --> 08:11.486
l had an uncle named Neelix.

08:13.226 --> 08:15.558
Are there other Talaxians
on your ship?

08:15.628 --> 08:17.118
l'm the only one.

08:17.196 --> 08:19.960
Why are you living
with aliens?

08:20.032 --> 08:21.795
They're my friends.

08:21.868 --> 08:24.632
Did you receive our hails?

08:24.737 --> 08:25.795
Yes.

08:25.905 --> 08:26.963
Why didn't you respond?

08:27.073 --> 08:30.236
We avoid
contact with outsiders.

08:32.410 --> 08:34.379
We were attacked.

08:35.448 --> 08:37.813
There were explosions.

08:37.884 --> 08:39.010
Did you...?

08:39.085 --> 08:40.677
No.

08:40.753 --> 08:42.653
We're not violent.

08:42.722 --> 08:44.087
Who fired at us?

08:44.155 --> 08:45.885
No one fired at you.

08:45.992 --> 08:48.153
There are miners
who use explosive charges

08:48.227 --> 08:49.694
to break apart the asteroids,

08:49.762 --> 08:53.357
so they can collect minerals
from the debris.

08:53.432 --> 08:55.024
l wish we'd known.

08:55.134 --> 08:56.726
Why were you carrying weapons?

08:56.836 --> 08:59.930
lt's standard procedure
for an away mission.

09:03.009 --> 09:04.203
Hello.

09:04.277 --> 09:05.744
What's your name?

09:05.811 --> 09:06.937
Brax.

09:07.013 --> 09:08.275
What's yours?

09:08.347 --> 09:10.281
l told you not to come in here.

09:10.349 --> 09:11.907
l just wanted to see him.

09:11.984 --> 09:14.452
You're supposed
to be helping Oxilon.

09:14.520 --> 09:16.784
He doesn't look
dangerous to me.

09:20.026 --> 09:22.085
l think you have the wrong idea
about us.

09:22.161 --> 09:24.857
l'm not supposed to be
talking to you at all.

09:27.266 --> 09:28.198
l'm feeling better.

09:28.301 --> 09:30.531
l-l'd like
to see my friends now.

09:33.372 --> 09:34.737
What are you doing?

09:34.807 --> 09:37.139
l've been told
not to let you leave.

09:47.954 --> 09:49.285
Harry?

09:49.355 --> 09:50.447
Still no response to hails.

09:50.523 --> 09:51.683
Janeway to the Shuttle Bay.

09:51.757 --> 09:53.315
Go ahead, Captain.

09:53.392 --> 09:55.155
What's the status
of the shield modifications?

09:55.227 --> 09:57.695
Lieutenant Torres and l will be
finished in a few minutes.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.321
Good.

09:59.398 --> 10:00.990
Take an away team and find them.

10:03.169 --> 10:05.535
Captain, there's a ship
approaching from astern.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.765
We're being hailed.

10:06.872 --> 10:08.703
On screen.

10:09.709 --> 10:11.939
ldentify yourselves.

10:12.044 --> 10:13.238
l'm Captain Janeway

10:13.312 --> 10:15.280
of the Federation
Starship Voyager.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.441
Commander Nocona.

10:17.516 --> 10:19.040
This is our asteroid field.

10:20.419 --> 10:22.284
We weren't aware of that.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.050
Now you are.

10:24.123 --> 10:27.183
We lost one of our shuttles
inside the field.

10:27.259 --> 10:30.057
We're preparing
to send a rescue team.

10:30.129 --> 10:32.563
All the resources belong to us.

10:32.632 --> 10:33.963
We're not interested
in the resources.

10:34.066 --> 10:35.363
We were only trying
to make contact

10:35.468 --> 10:36.366
with the Talaxians.

10:36.469 --> 10:39.461
What's your interest in them?

10:39.572 --> 10:41.699
One of my crewmen is from Talax.

10:41.807 --> 10:43.866
He was eager
to meet some of his people.

10:43.976 --> 10:45.705
You should have requested
permission

10:45.778 --> 10:47.609
before sending in a shuttle.

10:47.680 --> 10:49.841
We have a mining operation
in progress.

10:49.915 --> 10:53.009
Does that explain
the explosions we detected?

10:53.085 --> 10:54.848
Mining charges.

10:54.920 --> 10:57.445
We'd appreciate it
if you'd stop using them,

10:57.523 --> 10:58.956
until we can get our people out.

10:59.025 --> 11:00.049
l'm sorry.

11:00.126 --> 11:02.321
We're on a strict deadline.

11:02.395 --> 11:06.092
But l'll conduct a search
for your crew.

11:06.165 --> 11:08.895
lf they need help,
we'll provide it.

11:09.068 --> 11:10.865
That's kind of you.

11:10.970 --> 11:13.905
But we're prepared to go in
and get them ourselves.

11:13.973 --> 11:18.672
l cannot guarantee your safety
if you enter the asteroid field.

11:18.744 --> 11:20.109
Stay here.

11:20.179 --> 11:23.012
We'll contact you
when we find your people.

11:35.294 --> 11:37.854
l don't think
you're supposed to be here.

11:37.930 --> 11:39.557
This is my home.

11:39.632 --> 11:41.759
You can't tell me what to do.

11:41.834 --> 11:44.098
No, of course not.

11:44.203 --> 11:46.103
l just don't want you
to get in trouble.

11:47.173 --> 11:49.437
ls that a model ship?

11:49.508 --> 11:51.772
What's it called?

11:51.844 --> 11:54.005
How about The Two-Tailed
Talchok?

11:55.381 --> 11:57.110
The Fur Fly?.

12:00.019 --> 12:02.249
The ship l come from
is called Voyager.

12:02.354 --> 12:03.878
ls it big?

12:05.324 --> 12:06.348
And fast.

12:06.425 --> 12:08.290
Can l see it?

12:09.795 --> 12:11.422
l think it would be
a little difficult

12:11.497 --> 12:13.897
to take you there
while l'm stuck here.

12:13.966 --> 12:16.901
But if your mother
would let me out...

12:18.204 --> 12:19.193
That's her.

12:19.305 --> 12:21.170
You better hide.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.673
You won't tell her l'm here?

12:22.742 --> 12:24.334
No, of course not.

12:33.819 --> 12:38.449
Neelix, this is Oxilon
our Council Regent.

12:38.524 --> 12:40.287
l wish l could say it
was nice to meet you,

12:40.359 --> 12:43.226
but this wasn't exactly
the welcome l was expecting.

12:43.295 --> 12:44.421
You're free to go now.

12:53.372 --> 12:54.634
What about my friends?

12:54.707 --> 12:56.766
We've determined
they aren't hostile.

12:56.876 --> 12:58.503
They've been treated
for their injuries

12:58.577 --> 12:59.703
and asked to leave.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.577
They're aboard your shuttle
making repairs.

13:02.681 --> 13:03.648
l'll take you there.

13:05.050 --> 13:08.884
Well, now that everything
has been cleared up,

13:09.021 --> 13:11.990
maybe we could talk...

13:12.057 --> 13:13.820
get to know each other
a little?

13:16.896 --> 13:18.420
lf you'd like.

13:18.497 --> 13:20.863
My friends, too?

13:20.933 --> 13:22.525
l'm sorry.

13:22.635 --> 13:23.863
Why not?

13:23.969 --> 13:25.402
We've learned from experience

13:25.471 --> 13:26.597
to keep to ourselves.

13:28.374 --> 13:29.739
Well, if they're not welcome,

13:29.809 --> 13:31.538
l'm not staying, either.

13:33.245 --> 13:34.735
That's your choice.

13:42.121 --> 13:44.146
l know Oxilon seems
overly cautious,

13:44.223 --> 13:46.953
but we're not used
to having visitors.

13:47.059 --> 13:49.584
How many of you live here?

13:51.096 --> 13:53.564
Close to 500.

13:53.632 --> 13:55.497
All of our homes are connected
to the central

13:55.601 --> 13:57.899
cavern by tunnels and lifts.

13:58.003 --> 13:59.197
They allow us to move easily

13:59.305 --> 14:01.296
from one section
of the asteroid to another.

14:02.875 --> 14:06.811
lt must have taken years
to build all of this.

14:06.912 --> 14:08.436
Almost five.

14:08.514 --> 14:10.482
lt still isn't finished.

14:12.151 --> 14:15.052
...group five, report
to the lower level...

14:15.120 --> 14:16.644
Where did the technology
come from?

14:16.722 --> 14:19.748
We arrived here
with a caravan of six ships.

14:19.825 --> 14:21.486
We disassembled
all but one of them

14:21.560 --> 14:23.289
and modified their components.

14:23.362 --> 14:26.024
We converted torpedo launchers
to blast away rock

14:26.098 --> 14:27.565
and excavate these tunnels.

14:27.633 --> 14:29.931
These conduits run
into the asteroid's core.

14:31.303 --> 14:34.067
We use geothermal energy
to melt the ice that covers most

14:34.139 --> 14:35.936
of the outer surface.
lt provides us

14:36.041 --> 14:38.032
with oxygen and water.

14:38.143 --> 14:41.943
Who'd have imagined all of this
inside an asteroid?

14:46.252 --> 14:48.948
Your son seems like
a wonderful boy.

14:49.088 --> 14:50.487
How would you know?

14:50.556 --> 14:52.547
You only met him
for a few seconds.

14:53.893 --> 14:57.226
True, but l'm a quick
judge of character.

14:58.297 --> 15:01.425
He came to see you
while l was out, didn't he?

15:03.269 --> 15:05.203
You can't blame him
for being curious.

15:05.271 --> 15:08.604
Hmm.
He's a lot like his father--

15:08.674 --> 15:10.505
no fear.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.703
l'd like to meet your husband.

15:15.047 --> 15:16.605
He's dead.

15:16.682 --> 15:19.310
l'm sorry.

15:19.385 --> 15:20.443
l didn't mean to...

15:20.519 --> 15:21.816
lt's... it's all right.

15:21.887 --> 15:23.616
You didn't know.

15:28.560 --> 15:29.527
Neelix.

15:30.796 --> 15:31.888
Are you all right?

15:31.997 --> 15:33.521
l'm fine.

15:33.599 --> 15:38.434
Dexa, this is Lieutenant Paris
and Commander Tuvok.

15:38.537 --> 15:40.368
Thanks for bringing him back.

15:40.439 --> 15:41.804
We were getting worried.

15:43.709 --> 15:46.007
lt was nice to meet you.

15:54.620 --> 15:57.521
So, what can l do to help?

15:57.589 --> 16:00.717
Well, you can give me a hand
with this plasma manifold.

16:03.395 --> 16:05.226
How did it go?

16:05.297 --> 16:06.821
Well, uh, they didn't exactly

16:06.932 --> 16:08.399
send out a welcoming committee,

16:08.500 --> 16:10.127
but l'm sure
they have their reasons.

16:13.138 --> 16:15.368
l guess my expectations
were a little high.

16:17.409 --> 16:20.435
l regret that you didn't have
a more fulfilling experience.

16:20.512 --> 16:22.070
That's nice of you to say,
Commander,

16:22.147 --> 16:23.876
but it wasn't a complete
waste of time.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.247
l got to meet some
of my people again...

16:26.318 --> 16:28.411
even if it was a short visit.

16:28.487 --> 16:30.887
Who knows?

16:30.990 --> 16:35.222
lt's probably the last time
l'll ever see another Talaxian.

16:43.869 --> 16:45.530
Good work.

16:45.637 --> 16:47.298
Now we need to run a systems...

16:47.406 --> 16:49.431
lntruder alert.

16:49.541 --> 16:52.510
At least we know internal
sensors are working.

17:10.695 --> 17:12.721
Brax.

17:13.766 --> 17:15.290
You know him?

17:15.401 --> 17:17.699
We're old friends.

17:17.803 --> 17:20.829
You said you'd take me
to see Voyager.

17:20.973 --> 17:23.874
l don't think
your mother would approve.

17:23.942 --> 17:26.240
You won't tell her
l was here, will you?

17:26.310 --> 17:28.108
Here?

17:28.180 --> 17:30.842
Why, l have no idea
what you're talking about.

17:32.017 --> 17:33.712
l'll be right back.

17:37.089 --> 17:39.387
Three days isn't nearly
enough time for us

17:39.458 --> 17:41.085
to dismantle all our equipment.

17:41.160 --> 17:43.458
You should have begun
the first time we asked.

17:43.529 --> 17:44.860
We can't wait any longer.

17:44.930 --> 17:46.830
Demolition of the asteroid
is going to start

17:46.899 --> 17:48.799
whether you're here or not.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.061
You'd kill us?

17:50.169 --> 17:52.603
We don't want to hurt anyone.

17:52.671 --> 17:54.935
But our patience has run out.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.031
We've only got one ship.

17:57.142 --> 17:59.474
There won't be enough room
for any of our belongings.

17:59.545 --> 18:00.569
lt's not our fault

18:00.679 --> 18:02.579
you took apart
your other vessels.

18:02.614 --> 18:04.206
You can't do this.

18:04.283 --> 18:05.375
Dex, don't provoke him.

18:05.451 --> 18:07.112
Where are we supposed to go?

18:07.186 --> 18:09.347
l'm sure
you'll find a home somewhere.

18:09.421 --> 18:10.683
This is our home!

18:12.391 --> 18:13.858
You have no right to make us go.

18:16.662 --> 18:18.220
Leave her alone!

18:20.666 --> 18:22.634
Bring him here!

18:23.836 --> 18:24.768
Don't touch him!

18:24.837 --> 18:27.169
Are you going to stop me?

18:35.314 --> 18:38.283
You've said what you've come
to say, and now,

18:38.350 --> 18:40.250
l suggest you leave.

18:42.087 --> 18:46.046
You have three days to evacuate.

19:00.105 --> 19:03.199
You can see now why we're
suspicious of outsiders.

19:03.308 --> 19:05.003
Thank you
for protecting the boy,

19:05.077 --> 19:08.569
but l'm afraid your actions
might make things worse.

19:08.647 --> 19:10.205
How could they get any worse?

19:10.282 --> 19:12.147
Fighting back has
never done anything

19:12.217 --> 19:13.548
but cause us more trouble.

19:13.619 --> 19:15.416
And what has running
away ever done for us?

19:15.487 --> 19:17.182
-lt's kept us alive.
-Maybe it's time

19:17.256 --> 19:19.816
we stayed
and defended ourselves.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.484
Will you help us?

19:23.328 --> 19:24.556
l agree with Oxilon.

19:24.630 --> 19:26.495
Fighting isn't the answer...

19:26.565 --> 19:28.692
but l'll try to help.

19:28.767 --> 19:30.530
How?

19:30.636 --> 19:31.728
Well, uh...

19:31.837 --> 19:33.828
we could talk to my Captain,

19:33.939 --> 19:36.772
and maybe she can negotiate
with the miners,

19:36.842 --> 19:39.333
uh, get them to agree
to let you stay.

19:39.444 --> 19:40.877
Your Captain would be
willing to do that?

19:40.979 --> 19:44.972
The best thing would be for you
to come to Voyager--

19:45.050 --> 19:46.984
talk to her yourself.

19:47.052 --> 19:48.212
l want to go, too.

19:48.287 --> 19:50.152
Shh, Brax.

19:50.222 --> 19:51.519
Why don't you both come?

19:51.590 --> 19:53.057
l've seen your home.

19:53.125 --> 19:55.252
l'd like you to see mine.

20:02.334 --> 20:04.268
Commander Chakotay.

20:04.336 --> 20:08.067
l'd like you to meet
Dexa... and Brax.

20:08.140 --> 20:09.437
Welcome to the Bridge.

20:09.508 --> 20:11.499
And this is Ensign Kim.

20:17.249 --> 20:18.682
What's this?

20:18.750 --> 20:21.651
This... is an
engineering station.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.484
And over there is Tactical.

20:24.556 --> 20:27.081
And down there is the Helm.

20:27.159 --> 20:31.892
And this... is
the Captain's chair.

20:31.964 --> 20:33.955
Which station is yours?

20:34.099 --> 20:35.123
Well, actually, l don't have

20:35.200 --> 20:36.963
a specific...
See, l'm-l'm

20:37.069 --> 20:38.263
more of a, uh...

20:38.370 --> 20:40.861
Neelix does too many things
to have just one station.

20:40.973 --> 20:42.941
He's our... Ambassador,

20:43.008 --> 20:44.839
-Morale Officer.
-Trade Negotiator.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.400
Without a doubt,

20:46.511 --> 20:48.502
he's the most versatile
member of our crew.

20:52.651 --> 20:55.119
As you can see, our sensors
are extremely precise.

20:55.187 --> 20:57.951
We can scan for life signs
light-years away.

20:58.023 --> 20:59.820
That's how we found you.

20:59.891 --> 21:02.382
l have something else
that may interest you.

21:05.631 --> 21:07.326
What is it?

21:07.399 --> 21:09.526
Talax...

21:09.635 --> 21:11.660
You can scan that far away?

21:11.770 --> 21:13.897
No. This image is
from our database.

21:14.006 --> 21:16.998
lt's as beautiful as l remember.

21:18.610 --> 21:21.204
There's the Godo Mountain Range.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.214
And the Axiana Lakes.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.648
That was always one
of my favorite places.

21:25.717 --> 21:27.708
Mine, too.

21:27.786 --> 21:30.550
Why don't we
just go back to Talax?

21:30.622 --> 21:32.249
We could live there.

21:32.324 --> 21:35.191
lt's still controlled
by the Haakonians.

21:35.260 --> 21:37.694
They don't treat
Talaxians very well.

21:37.763 --> 21:38.957
That's why we left.

21:39.097 --> 21:40.792
Maybe Neelix could go with us,

21:40.866 --> 21:42.766
and we could fight them.

21:42.834 --> 21:44.563
Take the planet back.

21:44.670 --> 21:46.695
lf tomorrow's
negotiations go well,

21:46.805 --> 21:50.104
you won't have to go anywhere.

21:52.878 --> 21:55.847
Next stop... Engineering.

21:55.914 --> 21:58.144
The warp core.

21:58.216 --> 21:59.843
Neelix.

21:59.918 --> 22:01.408
Naomi.

22:01.520 --> 22:02.612
l'm sorry.

22:02.654 --> 22:04.246
l forgot all about
our Kadis-Kot game.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.883
That's all right.
l know you're busy.

22:07.025 --> 22:08.583
l just wanted
to meet your friends.

22:08.660 --> 22:11.220
Of course. Dexa, Brax...

22:11.296 --> 22:12.820
this is my goddaughter, Naomi.

22:12.898 --> 22:14.365
Hi.

22:14.433 --> 22:15.593
You live on a beautiful ship.

22:15.701 --> 22:17.225
Thanks.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.702
Maybe Brax would like
to go to the holodeck.

22:19.771 --> 22:20.795
That's a great idea.

22:20.906 --> 22:22.874
Lieutenant Paris has
a new program.

22:22.974 --> 22:25.067
''lnvaders from
the Ninth Dimension.''

22:25.143 --> 22:26.576
Sounds scary.

22:26.645 --> 22:27.942
Very.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.741
What's a holodeck?

22:29.815 --> 22:30.941
Neelix is right.

22:31.049 --> 22:33.108
Might be too scary for you.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.550
l'm not afraid.

22:34.619 --> 22:37.087
Can l?

22:42.661 --> 22:45.095
You're lucky
to have found these people.

22:48.033 --> 22:50.331
They obviously think
a great deal of you.

22:50.435 --> 22:52.062
The feeling's mutual.

23:05.016 --> 23:07.883
To the Axiana Lakes.

23:12.758 --> 23:14.555
lt really is delicious.

23:14.626 --> 23:17.151
l've been saving it
for 15 years.

23:17.229 --> 23:19.561
l wasn't sure l'd ever open it.

23:22.701 --> 23:24.396
But tonight...

23:24.503 --> 23:26.903
seemed like the right occasion.

23:31.977 --> 23:33.911
Would you like some more...

23:33.979 --> 23:35.071
taga cake?

23:35.147 --> 23:37.479
A-A little, please.

23:39.151 --> 23:41.745
l haven't had this in years.

23:41.820 --> 23:43.082
l'm glad you like it.

23:43.155 --> 23:44.087
Mmm.

23:44.156 --> 23:46.124
lt's a family recipe.

23:46.191 --> 23:48.022
You're a good cook.

23:49.094 --> 23:50.584
l haven't seen Brax

23:50.662 --> 23:52.653
this happy
since his father was alive.

23:55.934 --> 23:57.834
How did he...?

23:57.903 --> 23:59.063
l'm sorry.

23:59.171 --> 24:01.401
You probably don't
want to talk about it.

24:01.506 --> 24:03.974
l don't mind.

24:04.042 --> 24:06.738
We'd settled on a planet
called Phanos.

24:06.812 --> 24:08.575
There was a lot
of unoccupied territory,

24:08.647 --> 24:11.707
but the government restricted us
to a very small area.

24:11.783 --> 24:12.772
Why?

24:12.851 --> 24:14.751
They said it was a quarantine,

24:14.820 --> 24:17.755
to protect the population
from ''alien diseases.''

24:17.823 --> 24:20.417
But it was just an excuse.

24:20.492 --> 24:21.618
We were outsiders.

24:21.693 --> 24:23.593
They didn't want us
mixing with their people.

24:25.564 --> 24:27.088
lt wasn't long before
we realized

24:27.165 --> 24:28.393
we didn't have enough land

24:28.467 --> 24:30.662
to grow what we needed
to feed ourselves.

24:32.304 --> 24:37.742
Oxilon said we'd just have
to conserve our resources,

24:37.843 --> 24:41.836
but my husband was tired
of being told what to do.

24:41.913 --> 24:46.373
So, he started farming
outside the restricted zone.

24:46.451 --> 24:47.748
They didn't like that.

24:47.819 --> 24:50.652
A security patrol
confronted him.

24:50.722 --> 24:53.418
He told them he had to provide
for his family,

24:53.492 --> 24:55.357
that he wasn't afraid of them.

24:55.427 --> 24:57.725
There was a fight;
he was killed.

24:59.464 --> 25:01.261
l'm sorry.

25:01.366 --> 25:04.563
After that, we came here.

25:04.636 --> 25:06.831
We thought
we'd finally found a place

25:06.938 --> 25:08.735
where no one would bother us.

25:08.807 --> 25:11.173
Maybe this time
it'll be different.

25:11.243 --> 25:13.006
Maybe.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.613
But even if it isn't...

25:19.017 --> 25:21.144
thank you for trying.

25:28.827 --> 25:30.761
l should get
a good night's sleep,

25:30.829 --> 25:35.323
if l'm going to be my best
at the negotiations tomorrow.

25:41.006 --> 25:42.701
Uh, Neelix?

25:44.809 --> 25:48.301
lt's been a wonderful day.

25:57.622 --> 26:01.114
lsn't there enough to mine here,
without destroying their home?

26:01.192 --> 26:03.990
Their home contains
more than 30 percent

26:04.062 --> 26:05.927
of the field's ore.

26:05.997 --> 26:07.692
Without that asteroid...

26:07.766 --> 26:10.326
the operation isn't
worth the expense.

26:10.435 --> 26:14.235
Would you be open
to some kind of compensation?

26:14.306 --> 26:17.707
All we want are the minerals.

26:17.776 --> 26:19.869
And you'd kill us to get them.

26:20.011 --> 26:21.000
Wait.

26:22.547 --> 26:24.708
The Talaxians have found a way

26:24.783 --> 26:27.581
to produce a lot
of geothermal energy.

26:27.652 --> 26:30.780
Maybe they could
share it with you.

26:33.124 --> 26:35.115
What do you mean ''share''?

26:37.262 --> 26:41.221
You could convert it into fuel
to power your ships.

26:41.299 --> 26:45.827
The energy they generate isn't
compatible with our technology.

26:45.937 --> 26:48.405
We'd be willing to help you
make the modifications.

26:48.506 --> 26:50.474
We have quotas to meet.

26:50.542 --> 26:52.510
We don't have time for that.

26:52.611 --> 26:53.942
Commander,

26:54.012 --> 26:56.742
the future of more than
500 people is at stake here.

27:00.752 --> 27:03.243
And once, there was
a transporter accident.

27:03.321 --> 27:05.687
Neelix and Commander Tuvok
got combined

27:05.757 --> 27:07.486
to make a completely
different person.

27:07.559 --> 27:08.992
Really?

27:09.060 --> 27:11.995
You don't think l could make up
a story like that, do you?

27:12.063 --> 27:14.293
Hello, Neelix.

27:14.366 --> 27:16.027
Do you want to play Kadis-Kot?

27:16.134 --> 27:18.364
Maybe later.

27:29.047 --> 27:31.538
l knew it wouldn't work.

27:31.616 --> 27:33.641
We did get them
to make a small concession.

27:33.718 --> 27:35.117
They've extended the deadline.

27:35.186 --> 27:38.087
You'll have enough time
to dismantle your equipment.

27:38.156 --> 27:41.614
Thanks, but there's too much
to take with us.

27:41.693 --> 27:44.890
Captain Janeway has agreed
to ferry all of you

27:45.030 --> 27:48.431
and your supplies
to the nearest M-Class planet.

27:54.639 --> 27:56.937
Come on, Brax.
We're going home.

27:57.042 --> 27:57.940
Why?

27:58.076 --> 27:59.873
We have to pack.

27:59.944 --> 28:01.309
Come on.

28:05.016 --> 28:07.644
You said you were gonna help us.

28:07.719 --> 28:08.913
Brax.

28:24.936 --> 28:26.369
You wanted to see me?

28:26.438 --> 28:29.669
l've detected five
warp-capable species

28:29.741 --> 28:31.265
within two light-years
of the planet

28:31.376 --> 28:32.809
where we're taking
the Talaxians.

28:32.877 --> 28:35.869
l'm worried they might be
vulnerable to attack.

28:35.947 --> 28:38.381
They would be vulnerable
anywhere.

28:38.450 --> 28:40.042
l thought maybe
you could help me

28:40.118 --> 28:42.678
devise some defense strategies
for their new home.

28:42.754 --> 28:44.119
Frankly, Mr. Neelix,

28:44.189 --> 28:47.522
they don't seem inclined
to defend themselves.

28:47.592 --> 28:49.560
No, l-l suppose not...

28:49.627 --> 28:51.891
But if they were going
to make a stand,

28:52.030 --> 28:55.056
their emotional attachment
to their present home

28:55.133 --> 28:57.397
might be an asset.

28:57.502 --> 28:59.936
Are you saying they should stay?

29:00.004 --> 29:02.404
l'm speaking hypothetically.

29:02.440 --> 29:04.840
''Hypothetically...''

29:04.943 --> 29:07.207
if they wanted to defend
the asteroid,

29:07.278 --> 29:08.802
how would they do it?

29:08.947 --> 29:10.278
To begin with,

29:10.348 --> 29:13.681
they would need to establish
some kind of perimeter.

29:13.752 --> 29:16.220
You mean shields?

29:16.287 --> 29:17.515
Yes.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.523
The miners are monitoring
the asteroid.

29:19.591 --> 29:22.025
lf they detected the Talaxians
erecting a shield,

29:22.093 --> 29:23.720
they would attempt to stop them.

29:23.795 --> 29:25.763
l suppose so.

29:25.830 --> 29:27.161
Your people

29:27.232 --> 29:29.359
would need competent leadership
to defend against

29:29.467 --> 29:32.231
a preemptive attack.

29:32.337 --> 29:34.271
lf you had
the Captain's permission,

29:34.339 --> 29:37.035
would you be willing
to provide that leadership?

29:37.108 --> 29:38.370
Certainly not.

29:38.443 --> 29:40.877
lt would be a violation
of the Prime Directive.

29:41.012 --> 29:42.445
And even if it weren't,

29:42.514 --> 29:45.608
l don't believe that l am
the person most qualified

29:45.683 --> 29:47.776
to assume that role.

29:49.187 --> 29:50.279
You mean me?

29:50.355 --> 29:53.654
l am merely speaking
hypothetically.

29:58.530 --> 30:02.899
l couldn't lead those people,
Mr. Tuvok.

30:03.067 --> 30:05.900
l'm not a fighter.

30:06.070 --> 30:07.935
l'm just a cook...

30:08.072 --> 30:11.633
who sometimes imagines himself
to be a diplomat.

30:11.743 --> 30:15.179
On the contrary,
Mr. Neelix...

30:15.246 --> 30:18.841
you are much more than that.

30:18.917 --> 30:21.351
You are perhaps
the most resourceful individual

30:21.419 --> 30:24.354
l have ever known.

30:24.422 --> 30:26.754
l always thought you
just tolerated me.

30:26.825 --> 30:30.522
You do have
some annoying habits.

30:30.595 --> 30:34.361
However,
during your time on Voyager,

30:34.432 --> 30:36.957
you've developed
many valuable skills--

30:37.101 --> 30:38.159
skills that would

30:38.269 --> 30:39.964
serve you well
if you ever decided

30:40.138 --> 30:43.005
to assume a leadership role.

30:43.141 --> 30:45.109
You really think so?

30:45.210 --> 30:47.007
Let me be clear.

30:47.145 --> 30:49.841
l'm not urging you
to do anything.

30:49.914 --> 30:51.506
l am simply telling you

30:51.583 --> 30:54.643
that l believe
that you are more than capable.

31:05.864 --> 31:08.298
Going somewhere, Mr. Neelix?

31:08.366 --> 31:09.492
Just to see my friends.

31:09.601 --> 31:11.592
Chakotay tells me you're
using your own ship.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.466
Why not have Tom
take you in the Flyer?.

31:13.571 --> 31:15.129
l didn't want to bother anyone.

31:15.240 --> 31:17.765
You wouldn't be planning
anything foolish, would you?

31:17.876 --> 31:20.936
Whatever l do, l promise
it won't involve Voyager.

31:21.012 --> 31:23.810
That wasn't my question.

31:23.882 --> 31:27.841
l know you have
Prime Directive issues,

31:27.919 --> 31:29.716
but l'm not officially
part of your crew,

31:29.787 --> 31:31.482
so l don't have
the same constraints.

31:31.556 --> 31:34.582
You're as much a part
of this crew as anyone else.

31:35.994 --> 31:37.689
Are you ordering me not to go?

31:37.762 --> 31:39.662
That depends on what
you're going to do.

31:41.432 --> 31:43.366
lt's up to the Talaxians.

31:52.744 --> 31:55.713
Safe journey, Mr. Neelix.

32:05.156 --> 32:07.056
l know from personal experience

32:07.125 --> 32:09.286
that you have
force field emitters.

32:09.360 --> 32:12.887
We could use them
to establish a shield grid.

32:12.964 --> 32:15.762
We'd need to deploy
a series of them

32:15.833 --> 32:19.894
on the asteroid's surface,
along bisecting diameters.

32:20.071 --> 32:22.733
16 emitters should be enough
to form a grid.

32:22.840 --> 32:24.307
Even if you're right,

32:24.375 --> 32:27.037
it'd take weeks to dig that
many tunnels to the surface.

32:27.111 --> 32:28.271
Commander Tuvok suggested

32:28.346 --> 32:29.904
that we could
modify the emitters,

32:29.981 --> 32:31.949
so they could be fired
from torpedo tubes

32:32.083 --> 32:35.678
on your ship... implanted
in the surface.

32:35.753 --> 32:37.550
As soon as the miners

32:37.622 --> 32:39.613
realized what we were doing,
they'd attack.

32:39.691 --> 32:41.318
l could provide cover
from my ship.

32:41.392 --> 32:43.587
But you're right,
we'd have to work quickly.

32:43.661 --> 32:45.185
We could route power
to the emitters

32:45.263 --> 32:46.389
directly from the core.

32:46.464 --> 32:47.931
They have
a permanent energy supply.

32:47.999 --> 32:49.125
Good idea.

32:49.200 --> 32:51.691
lf we do what you're suggesting,
people are going to be hurt.

32:51.769 --> 32:54.738
This is your home.

32:56.074 --> 32:59.168
The miners have no right
to force you out.

32:59.243 --> 33:00.642
l agree,

33:00.745 --> 33:02.610
-but fighting?
-l don't like it, either,

33:02.647 --> 33:04.877
but at some point you have
to stand up for yourselves.

33:04.983 --> 33:08.009
How do you know
there won't be someone else

33:08.086 --> 33:10.077
to terrorize you
the next place you go?!

33:11.189 --> 33:12.451
You know he's right.

33:15.860 --> 33:18.795
No one has worked harder
to build this place than you.

33:18.863 --> 33:21.661
lsn't it worth defending?

33:33.578 --> 33:34.909
Wait for my com call.

33:34.979 --> 33:37.413
As soon as
the last emitter's in place,

33:37.482 --> 33:39.507
start routing power
to the grid.

33:39.584 --> 33:41.552
Understood.

33:43.588 --> 33:45.715
You're scared, aren't you?

33:47.859 --> 33:49.793
You?

33:49.861 --> 33:51.624
Terrified.

33:51.696 --> 33:52.788
Be careful.

33:52.864 --> 33:54.957
l will.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.796
Oxilon to Neelix.

33:56.901 --> 33:58.334
The emitters are loaded.

33:58.403 --> 34:00.268
We're ready.

34:00.371 --> 34:02.669
l'll see you soon.

34:32.603 --> 34:33.695
Two more, and we're done.

34:33.804 --> 34:35.067
Acknowledged.

34:35.139 --> 34:38.130
We're moving into position
for the next one.

34:40.210 --> 34:42.475
The miners' ship
is on an intercept course.

34:42.547 --> 34:44.344
Evasive maneuvers!

34:50.487 --> 34:51.648
They're targeting our shields.

34:51.722 --> 34:52.813
l'll deal with them.

34:52.889 --> 34:55.882
Just focus on your job.

34:55.960 --> 34:58.952
All right, Mr. Vulcan, let's see
if you were right about me.

35:12.477 --> 35:14.411
Neelix, you have to hurry.

35:14.479 --> 35:17.505
Just one more emitter,
and you can activate the shield.

35:28.159 --> 35:29.285
Neelix to Oxilon.

35:29.360 --> 35:30.759
My weapons are off-line.

35:30.828 --> 35:31.886
We're not in position yet.

35:31.996 --> 35:33.088
You have to get there.

35:33.164 --> 35:35.462
They're going
to launch another charge.

35:42.340 --> 35:43.898
Neelix, what are you doing?

35:44.008 --> 35:45.441
Don't worry about me.

35:45.510 --> 35:47.944
Just get ready
to bring the grid on line.

35:56.387 --> 35:57.854
Delta Flyer to Neelix.

35:57.922 --> 35:59.321
Are you all right?

35:59.390 --> 36:02.416
Fine, Captain,
but you shouldn't be here.

36:02.527 --> 36:04.392
You're violating
the Prime Directive.

36:04.428 --> 36:06.896
We're just helping
a friend in distress.

36:23.047 --> 36:24.639
Dexa to Neelix.

36:24.715 --> 36:26.080
The shield's holding.

36:26.150 --> 36:27.276
You did it.

36:27.351 --> 36:30.616
We did it.

36:31.689 --> 36:35.090
Captain's Log, Stardate 54868.6.

36:35.159 --> 36:37.218
Commander Nocona
seems to have given up

36:37.295 --> 36:40.093
his attempts to penetrate
the Talaxians' shield.

36:40.164 --> 36:41.893
Voyager's ready
to get underway,

36:41.999 --> 36:43.899
but we're giving
Mr. Neelix time

36:44.001 --> 36:46.629
to say a difficult good-bye
to his new friends.

36:46.737 --> 36:48.898
We're grateful
for everything you've done.

36:49.006 --> 36:51.099
l'm just happy
things worked out.

36:51.209 --> 36:54.406
And l'm glad that l could
spend some time here...

36:54.478 --> 36:55.775
with all of you.

36:56.981 --> 36:57.913
l'd better go.

36:57.982 --> 36:59.244
Stay here.

36:59.317 --> 37:01.512
He can't, Brax.

37:01.619 --> 37:04.179
He has responsibilities
on Voyager.

37:04.222 --> 37:06.884
l promise l'll stay
in touch as long as l can.

37:28.579 --> 37:30.547
Come in.

37:34.252 --> 37:36.652
Hi.

37:36.721 --> 37:38.689
Neelix.

37:40.858 --> 37:43.418
What are you working on?

37:43.494 --> 37:46.054
A report on proto-humanoid
cultures...

37:46.130 --> 37:49.361
for Commander Chakotay's
paleontology class.

37:49.433 --> 37:51.025
Aha.

37:51.135 --> 37:53.069
Need some help?

37:53.137 --> 37:54.798
l'm almost finished.

37:57.074 --> 37:59.702
Do you have time
for a game of Kadis-Kot?

37:59.777 --> 38:01.938
l have to get up early.

38:04.048 --> 38:06.380
l guess you'd better get
to sleep then.

38:08.252 --> 38:10.015
Do you want me to tuck you in?

38:10.087 --> 38:11.611
Tell you a bedtime story?

38:12.690 --> 38:14.624
You haven't done that in years.

38:14.692 --> 38:18.184
Just think of all the stories
you've missed.

38:18.262 --> 38:22.494
Thanks, Neelix,
but l can put myself to bed.

38:22.566 --> 38:26.161
l'm not a little girl anymore.

38:41.986 --> 38:45.422
l didn't think anyone else
stayed up this late.

38:46.957 --> 38:50.791
Well, l wouldn't want you
to have coffee all by yourself.

38:50.861 --> 38:53.125
Have a seat.

39:02.406 --> 39:04.431
l've been thinking
about something.

39:06.944 --> 39:09.606
lt's a little hard
to put into words.

39:09.680 --> 39:12.171
l haven't really made
a decision yet,

39:12.249 --> 39:13.580
and of course,

39:13.651 --> 39:17.587
l would never ignore
my responsibilities on Voyager.

39:17.655 --> 39:19.384
Of course not.

39:19.457 --> 39:21.584
l take them very seriously.

39:21.659 --> 39:23.593
l know you do.

39:26.464 --> 39:29.331
l've been thinking
about something, too.

39:29.400 --> 39:31.425
Maybe you could help me.

39:31.535 --> 39:34.095
l'd be happy to.

39:34.205 --> 39:39.438
lt's an idea l'd need to talk
to Starfleet Command about.

39:39.510 --> 39:41.876
lt must be important.

39:41.979 --> 39:43.879
lt is.

39:43.981 --> 39:45.414
Now that we've established

39:45.483 --> 39:47.713
two-way communication
with Earth...

39:49.954 --> 39:53.014
it seems to me Starfleet
could use a permanent Ambassador

39:53.090 --> 39:55.024
in the Delta Quadrant.

39:55.092 --> 39:57.526
This ambassador
would have to stay

39:57.595 --> 40:00.120
in frequent contact
with Voyager.

40:00.197 --> 40:02.665
Certainly.

40:04.802 --> 40:06.633
lt would be difficult for me
to run this ship

40:06.737 --> 40:09.069
without you, Neelix.

40:09.140 --> 40:14.043
But that might be a sacrifice
l'd be willing to make...

40:14.111 --> 40:17.945
for the greater good
of Starfleet.

40:18.015 --> 40:21.678
Of course, the assignment
would be entirely voluntary.

40:24.388 --> 40:28.324
You wouldn't be interested,
would you?

41:36.293 --> 41:38.625
Good-bye...

41:38.696 --> 41:41.426
and good luck, Ambassador.

41:52.877 --> 41:54.674
Mr. Neelix.

42:06.290 --> 42:09.384
Live long and prosper.

42:10.305 --> 42:16.173
