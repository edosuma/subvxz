<i>NARRATOR".
As we last took leave of Batman and Robin...</i>

00:12.472 --> 00:15.016
<i>...The Green Hornet had been made
into a rare stamp...</i>

00:15.183 --> 00:19.395
<i>...and then thumbtacked to a wall
by the corrupt Colonel Gumm...</i>

00:19.604 --> 00:22.357
<i>...with Kato still being
blocked and perforated...</i>

00:22.524 --> 00:26.736
...in <i>Gumm's shameful stamping machine,
and the Dynamic Duo to follow.</i>

00:27.654 --> 00:30.657
<i>Once they're unglued
from Gumm's glue pad...</i>

00:30.865 --> 00:33.826
<i>...for you, who've breathlessly
waited and wondered...</i>

00:34.035 --> 00:36.412
<i>...some man-hours have passed.</i>

00:36.621 --> 00:39.958
<i>For the Caped Crusaders,
mere moments...</i>

00:40.166 --> 00:43.086

<i>NARRATOR".
Kato, too, made into a man-size stamp...</i>

02:04.709 --> 02:07.629
<i>...and thumbtacked to the wall?</i>

02:07.795 --> 02:10.757
<i>What monster of a man
is Colonel Gumm?</i>

02:11.215 --> 02:15.678
<i>And what monstrous mutilation
faces our mantled man-hunters?</i>

02:17.221 --> 02:20.433
Well, Dynamic Duo...

02:20.642 --> 02:23.186
...your turn.

02:26.314 --> 02:29.192
I think you will find us a much
stickier proposition, Gumm.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.736
Not with another little invention of mine.

02:31.944 --> 02:34.947
Colonel Gumm's Super Instant Glue Gone.

02:35.156 --> 02:38.826
The invisible dissolving agent
contained in this spray can...

02:39.035 --> 02:41.371
...will penetrate anything and anybody...

02:41.579 --> 02:43.831
...and will dissolve glue in an instant.

02:48.086 --> 02:52.674
Now, into the enlarged perforating
and coiling machine...

02:52.882 --> 02:56.386
...to be stamped with my disapproval.

02:57.762 --> 02:59.347
Robin, the switch.

03:07.730 --> 03:10.233
- Now to remove this panel.
-Why the panel?

03:10.733 --> 03:13.986
Because The Green Hornet and Kato
are still alive inside this machine.

03:14.195 --> 03:15.947
Still alive? How could they be?

03:16.155 --> 03:18.408
- They're thumbtacked to the wall.
-Shh.

03:23.663 --> 03:25.915
That should give them a chance
to use their Hornet Sting.

03:26.332 --> 03:29.168
Quick. Into the truck
with these cases of stamps.

03:30.545 --> 03:34.841
I'll get Miss Pinkston. We'll hold her
as hostage. Meet me in the garage.

03:35.049 --> 03:39.345
- Gumm and his goons are getting away.
-No, Robin, they've had it. They won't get far.

03:40.179 --> 03:41.764
Aah.

03:46.144 --> 03:47.311
Holy living end.

03:47.520 --> 03:49.814
It looked like the end there for a minute.

03:50.022 --> 03:53.151
But there was a small niche
between the gum-applier...

03:53.359 --> 03:57.321
...and the perforating needles.
-And we are both quite flexible.

03:57.530 --> 04:00.283
But there wasn't enough room
to use my Hornet Sting...

04:00.491 --> 04:03.244
...to blast us out
until that panel was loosened.

04:03.453 --> 04:05.079
How did the machine
take your picture?

04:05.538 --> 04:08.833
No doubt an automatic
image-orthicon of some kind.

04:09.041 --> 04:10.460
Wrong, Green Hornet.

04:10.626 --> 04:15.506
It was a high-velocity spectrobiscopic
range reflector mini-unit. Hm.

04:21.928 --> 04:26.017
Uh, are you feeding that pink mutt
my alphabet soup?

04:26.225 --> 04:30.104
Apricot was hungry,
and she's only down to the Ds.

04:30.313 --> 04:31.481
- Come on.
-No.

04:31.647 --> 04:34.567
- Yes. And blindfolded too.
-No.

04:34.734 --> 04:36.986
- Ha-ha-ha!
-Aah!

04:37.153 --> 04:39.155
How could you know
they were alive in there?

04:39.322 --> 04:41.532
When this masked meddler
was tossed in...

04:41.741 --> 04:44.327
...he had this gruesome gizmo with him.

04:44.494 --> 04:49.874
But you will notice, Robin, it is conspicuously
missing from that giant stamp.

04:50.082 --> 04:57.048
Ergo, the high-velocity spectrobiscopic
range reflector mini-unit...

04:57.256 --> 04:59.884
...failed to produce a true facsimile.

05:00.092 --> 05:02.220
Gosh, that's some "ergo," Batman.

05:02.553 --> 05:08.559
Yes, Batman, that's very clever,
but it seems as if in saving us...

05:08.768 --> 05:10.728
...you've allowed our assailants
to escape.

05:10.937 --> 05:14.899
None too smart
for a smart crime-fighter.

05:17.568 --> 05:18.903
Are we just letting them go?

05:19.111 --> 05:23.366
As a duly deputized officer of the law,
I had no tangible evidence to hold them on.

05:23.574 --> 05:25.993
But in giving them their heads,
so to speak...

05:26.160 --> 05:30.832
...perhaps we can provide
some tangible evidence shortly.

05:31.040 --> 05:32.875
Come on, Robin.

05:36.128 --> 05:37.505
- What's the matter?
-I smell pink.

05:38.881 --> 05:41.175
- You're just tired.
-No, I mean I really smell pink.

05:41.384 --> 05:43.594
The color pink.

05:43.803 --> 05:45.179
Pinky Pinkston.

05:45.388 --> 05:48.140
She wears Eau de Carnation,
an expensive pink perfume.

05:49.600 --> 05:50.935
And she's been...

05:52.895 --> 05:54.146
...in here.

05:54.355 --> 05:58.192
There's no doubt about it. Probably looked up
by her foreman before we arrived.

05:58.401 --> 06:00.027
What's that?

06:00.236 --> 06:01.487
I guess I'm tired...

06:01.696 --> 06:03.739
...but it looks like
a bowl of alphabet soup.

06:05.908 --> 06:09.328
Robin, have you noticed
the J's, Q's and Z's are missing?

06:09.537 --> 06:11.998
Holy uncanny photographic
mental processes.

06:12.540 --> 06:15.793
Miss Pinkston expected
Batman here tonight.

06:16.002 --> 06:18.921
No doubt she contrived
to leave a message.

06:19.130 --> 06:20.840
In the soup?

06:25.511 --> 06:27.889
Gosh, Batman.
It's sure a good thing you brought...

06:28.097 --> 06:30.349
...that empty alphabet soup Bat container.

06:30.766 --> 06:32.602
Right, Robin.

06:34.020 --> 06:37.315
The right tool for the right job.

06:49.327 --> 06:50.453
To the Batcave.

06:53.664 --> 06:57.293
Gosh, I never knew there were
no punctuation marks in alphabet soup.

07:00.171 --> 07:03.633
- Yes, commissioner?
-Batman, what a relief.

07:03.841 --> 07:08.012
We were a little afraid there might be
some, uh, overdue postage on you.

07:08.220 --> 07:11.474
<i>You must have found those man-sized
stamps of The Green Hornet...</i>

07:11.682 --> 07:14.226
...and his masked confederate
in the stamp factory.

07:14.602 --> 07:17.021
Well, one of our men did
on routine duty.

07:17.229 --> 07:19.148
You can tear the stamps up,
commissioner.

07:19.357 --> 07:22.860
The Green Hornet is still very much alive
and operating in Gotham City.

07:23.235 --> 07:24.737
What's the story, Batman?

07:25.112 --> 07:28.074
It's a long one, commissioner.
I'll explain later.

07:28.282 --> 07:32.286
Right now, Robin and I are trying
to work out another puzzle.

07:32.620 --> 07:35.915
Well, get back to work, by all means.

07:38.918 --> 07:43.881
Forgive the intrusion, sir,
but Mr. Reid is upstairs. He'd like to see you.

07:44.090 --> 07:47.009
Ask Mrs. Cooper to keep him occupied,
Alfred, a few minutes.

07:47.218 --> 07:51.889
- She, uh-- She's under the hair-dryer, sir.
-Ah, yes. Hm.

07:52.098 --> 07:54.392
I'll be right there, Alfred.
Keep trying, old chum.

07:55.851 --> 07:59.438
There's more letters in this alphabet soup
than there are in the alphabet.

08:03.234 --> 08:04.860
- Hello, Britt.
-Hi.

08:05.027 --> 08:07.863
If I'd known you were in there,
I wouldn't have stood on ceremony.

08:08.364 --> 08:11.117
Well, it would be more comfortable
in the living room here anyway.

08:11.325 --> 08:13.619
- Sit down, Britt.
-Thanks.

08:15.413 --> 08:18.833
You're up early, aren't you?

08:19.041 --> 08:21.585
Yes, Bruce. I'm worried about Pinky.

08:22.962 --> 08:26.173
Nobody answered at her apartment
or the factory.

08:26.382 --> 08:28.509
Do you suppose something
could have happened to her?

08:28.718 --> 08:32.929
All that talk about
The Green Hornet and Batman.

08:33.139 --> 08:36.308
Incidentally, uh,
I should have told you this yesterday.

08:36.517 --> 08:39.520
I met Batman
in Commissioner Gordon's office.

08:39.729 --> 08:42.231
- He sends his regards.
-Very thoughtful.

08:42.606 --> 08:46.235
Uh, what kind of a guy is he, Bruce?

08:47.278 --> 08:48.738
An enigma.

08:48.946 --> 08:52.533
I really don't know him very well, Britt.

08:52.742 --> 08:57.663
But if he tangled with Green Hornet last night,
Green Hornet would have gotten the worst of it.

08:57.955 --> 09:00.666
Well, that would be a switch. Heh.

09:00.875 --> 09:02.877
Green Hornet
usually comes out the winner.

09:03.294 --> 09:05.755
That's because you have no Batman
in your city.

09:06.672 --> 09:09.633
Oh. Well, maybe. Hm.

09:10.092 --> 09:11.552
But I'm still worried about Pinky.

09:12.094 --> 09:14.889
Well, Pinky seems to me to be a girl
that can take care of herself.

09:15.056 --> 09:17.099
- Mm. Mm.
-I wouldn't worry.

09:17.808 --> 09:20.519
- How was the convention last night?
-Heh.

09:20.728 --> 09:23.564
Dull. How was the board meeting
at the Wayne Foundation?

09:24.273 --> 09:25.858
Dreary.

09:27.193 --> 09:33.282
If you're going to be in town for a while,
maybe we could dig up some excitement?

09:33.491 --> 09:36.368
Yeah, like old times.

09:36.702 --> 09:41.707
Ah, before we settled down
into our mundane lives.

09:42.124 --> 09:45.169
Like old times.
We had a few laughs, didn't we?

09:45.377 --> 09:50.049
Before we settled down
and became such solid citizens.

09:50.257 --> 09:54.136
Yeah. Yeah, it's guys like
The Green Hornet and Batman...

09:54.303 --> 09:56.680
...that see all the action, get all the kicks.

09:57.223 --> 09:58.599
Would you trade places with them?

09:59.308 --> 10:03.020
Well, not with Batman.

10:04.939 --> 10:07.775
I wouldn't be caught dead
in that crazy cowl of his.

10:12.613 --> 10:13.906
It's impossible, Batman.

10:14.115 --> 10:17.743
I'm getting no place fast
with this alphabet mishmash.

10:17.952 --> 10:20.704
We were a little offhand
with the Batcomputer yesterday, Robin.

10:20.871 --> 10:27.336
I suggest we give it another chance.
I'll just scoop these letters up.

10:29.505 --> 10:30.881
Hm.

10:31.215 --> 10:33.968
I think that's all of them.

10:39.431 --> 10:41.142
Bat funnel.

10:45.020 --> 10:48.816
Now the Batcomputer ingestor switches.

10:49.900 --> 10:52.403
You mean you're gonna feed those letters
to the Batcomputer?

10:54.196 --> 10:57.700
They're made out of noodles.
Easy to digest.

11:03.038 --> 11:06.750
It did it.
"if anyone can decode this message...

11:06.959 --> 11:09.962
...Gumm is taking me to warehouse
as hostage.

11:10.171 --> 11:14.800
Watch stamp exhibition tonight.
Pinky Pinkston."

11:15.009 --> 11:18.220
And not a J, Q or Z
in the entire message.

11:18.429 --> 11:20.055
That's very clever of Miss Pinkston.

11:20.264 --> 11:23.767
I'll wager she fed
all the J's, Q's and Z's to Apricot...

11:23.976 --> 11:26.520
...trusting we'd be able to unravel the clue.

11:26.729 --> 11:30.274
- Who's Apricot?
-Her pink Maltese.

11:32.109 --> 11:36.197
Some of Bruce Wayne's female friends
sound a little dizzy to me.

11:36.363 --> 11:39.158
But Miss Pinkston
wasn't the only clever one.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.869
The Batcomputer even punctuated this.

11:42.244 --> 11:45.080
Yes, it seems to be back on the beam.

11:45.289 --> 11:49.376
Let's see if it can come up with the warehouse
where Miss Pinkston is being held hostage.

11:49.585 --> 11:51.420
Yellow Pages.

12:16.820 --> 12:19.406
Don't tell me it's given up again.

12:19.615 --> 12:23.244
There's no dual identity in a warehouse.

12:23.452 --> 12:26.580
I think it's blown a Bat fuse
All those noodle letters.

12:26.789 --> 12:30.542
No, Master Robin.
The Batcomputer is not to blame.

12:30.751 --> 12:32.753
It's Mrs. Cooper's hair-dryer, sir.

12:32.920 --> 12:36.632
It short-circuited, and half the electricity
in the entire establishment is off.

12:36.799 --> 12:38.509
And the telephones are out too.

12:38.717 --> 12:44.556
I've sent for a telephone repairman
and an electrician, but it may take hours.

12:47.977 --> 12:52.231
And so because of a woman's vanity...

12:52.815 --> 12:56.485
...a battle may be lost.

12:56.694 --> 13:00.239
Lost? I'm surprised at you, Batman.

13:00.447 --> 13:05.703
Many battles have been won before electricity
and telephone were ever invented.

13:06.370 --> 13:09.873
Gosh, Robin. You may be right.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.084
Just arrange to have
the stamp exhibition...

13:12.293 --> 13:15.129
...in the Constellation Room tonight
well-publicized.

13:15.337 --> 13:17.923
Then there's bound to be some action.

13:18.132 --> 13:23.637
And a Batclimb up Gotham Towers West
will help us flex our muscles.

13:24.263 --> 13:25.472
Chin up, old churn.

13:27.141 --> 13:31.687
<i>NARRATOR". Meanwhile, the scene of battle
shifts to an isolated warehouse...</i>

13:31.895 --> 13:37.067
<i>...but warfare wages on
in a strange and oblique manner.</i>

13:37.276 --> 13:41.113
So Colonel Gumm is holding me hostage,
Apricot? For what?

13:41.280 --> 13:44.033
Who's even going to know it,
if he's killed The Green Hornet...

13:44.241 --> 13:47.202
...his masked companion
and Batman and Robin?

13:47.411 --> 13:52.499
Word will get around, Miss Pinkston.
Heh-heh. Mm.

13:52.666 --> 13:55.961
Reprint, this alphabet soup
needs more consonants in it.

13:56.337 --> 13:58.922
Yes, Apricot,
word will get around, all right.

13:59.131 --> 14:02.301
And it won't be composed
of letters from alphabet soup.

14:02.509 --> 14:08.640
You know how it will be spelled out?
Counterfeiter. Kidnapper. Murderer.

14:09.725 --> 14:12.478
As long as we're spelling things out,
Miss Pinkston...

14:12.686 --> 14:14.688
...let me spell something out for you.

14:14.855 --> 14:18.067
Bruce Wayne was in the shop
of his stamp dealer yesterday afternoon...

14:18.275 --> 14:21.737
...making inquiries about
that missing stamp of your old man's.

14:21.945 --> 14:24.323
Do you suppose he means
the Gotham Gothic, Apricot?

14:25.699 --> 14:29.953
And last night at the factory,
The Green Hornet mentioned the same stamp...

14:30.162 --> 14:32.373
...and the same stamp dealer.

14:32.706 --> 14:36.877
Is he trying to tell me that Bruce Wayne
is The Green Hornet?

14:37.086 --> 14:40.464
And I strongly suspect
that Britt Reid is Batman.

14:40.672 --> 14:42.966
No, I could never believe that.

14:43.175 --> 14:44.343
Besides, how do you know...

14:44.510 --> 14:47.679
...what Bruce Wayne
was telling his stamp dealer?

14:47.888 --> 14:49.890
- Because I--
-Hold it, boss.

14:50.099 --> 14:52.434
Don't spill any more beans.

14:52.643 --> 14:54.478
You're right, Reprint.

14:54.686 --> 14:57.564
Well, goodbye, Miss Pinkston.

14:57.773 --> 15:00.984
By the time you're found,
if you're found...

15:01.193 --> 15:03.654
...I shall be thousands of miles away...

15:03.862 --> 15:08.200
...with a fortune that'll make your Pink Chip
Stamps empire look like pink peanuts.

15:12.871 --> 15:16.875
Apricot, and this time I am talking to you,
get to work on the ropes around my wrists.

15:24.842 --> 15:29.138
- Bruce Wayne's The Green Hornet?
-And Britt Reid is Batman?

15:29.346 --> 15:31.682
- Incredible.
-Unthinkable.

15:31.849 --> 15:34.893
Inconceivable.
I'll call them both up at once.

15:35.102 --> 15:37.271
Call them over here
and face them with it.

15:37.479 --> 15:39.356
Then that's good, isn't it, Apricot?

15:39.565 --> 15:43.902
If either Britt or Bruce arrive,
then Colonel Gumm was wrong.

15:44.111 --> 15:47.239
For after all,
Batman and The Green Hornet are dead.

15:47.698 --> 15:49.116
- Are they?
-Are they?

15:50.617 --> 15:53.829
Oh, ho-ho. Oh, no, Miss Pinkston.
No, they're not.

15:54.037 --> 15:55.622
I talked to Batman earlier today.

15:55.831 --> 15:58.834
He said it was a long story,
and it must be.

15:59.042 --> 16:02.880
And then he asked me to publicize the
International Stamp Exhibition this evening.

16:03.046 --> 16:05.090
He sounded very much alive.

16:05.299 --> 16:07.509
And he said The Green Hornet was too.

16:07.885 --> 16:10.929
Then there's really no use
in calling either Britt or Bruce...

16:11.138 --> 16:13.223
...is there, Apricot?
-Why not?

16:13.724 --> 16:15.601
Do you really think, gentlemen...

16:15.767 --> 16:19.480
...that either Batman or The Green Hornet
would admit to anything...

16:19.688 --> 16:23.400
...after keeping their dual identities
a secret for so very long?

16:23.817 --> 16:25.152
Begorra, she's right.

16:25.360 --> 16:29.448
- What do we do now, commissioner?
-I don't know, Chief O'Hara.

16:30.365 --> 16:32.576
May I make a suggestion, gentlemen?

16:32.993 --> 16:34.203
- Of course.
-Of course.

16:34.786 --> 16:37.247
By publicizing the stamp exhibition...

16:37.456 --> 16:42.336
...Batman may be intending to smoke
The Green Hornet out, as it were.

16:42.544 --> 16:44.880
Let's get over
to the Constellation Room at once.

16:45.088 --> 16:48.383
It'll be interesting to see who arrives,
and who wins.

16:48.592 --> 16:49.676
And who's who.

16:55.432 --> 16:57.476
You seem thoughtful.

16:57.684 --> 17:02.564
We're heading for another clash
with the Caped Crusaders, and I don't like it.

17:03.106 --> 17:06.193
Why not? We've never run away
from trouble before.

17:06.401 --> 17:10.280
Yes, but this double identity
poses extra problems this time.

17:10.489 --> 17:13.951
We know they're heroic crime-fighters,
they think we're criminals.

17:14.159 --> 17:17.579
We must come out on top,
but they mustn't suffer.

17:18.288 --> 17:21.208
Kung fu is kung fu. It's not child's play.

17:21.415 --> 17:26.338
I know, but our tricks are gonna
have to be tempered with good judgment.

17:28.298 --> 17:31.301
You were right, Robin.
This is a great way to limber up.

17:31.510 --> 17:34.805
Yes, there's nothing quite like a Batclimb.

17:40.102 --> 17:42.437
The Dynamic Duo.

17:43.564 --> 17:45.774
There are other ways
of getting into this building.

17:46.108 --> 17:49.695
But none that provide
the element of surprise that we need.

17:49.903 --> 17:51.488
What are you doing in Gotham City?

17:52.030 --> 17:55.993
Some of the paintings from my collection
go on exhibit here tomorrow.

17:57.327 --> 18:02.374
I wonder if some creative artist
couldn't capture the two of you on canvas.

18:02.916 --> 18:06.253
- Perhaps the Cubistic school.
-Oh, never.

18:06.461 --> 18:08.547
- Pop art?
-No.

18:08.755 --> 18:13.885
I think canned tomato soup is to eat,
not to frame and hang on a wall.

18:14.303 --> 18:16.847
Dali? Picasso?

18:17.598 --> 18:20.684
Bit of an art buff yourself,
aren't you, Batman?

18:21.226 --> 18:26.148
I'm afraid that crime-fighting allows
me only the luxury of collecting criminals.

18:26.315 --> 18:28.859
But you should see
the great mug shots we've got.

18:29.067 --> 18:31.862
- Robin--
- Uh, don't reprimand him.

18:32.571 --> 18:34.823
Who knows who posed for the Mona <i>Lisa?</i>

18:35.032 --> 18:37.367
Maybe one of the wickedest women
in the world.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.626
Oh, but what a smile.

18:47.628 --> 18:54.134
<i>NARRATOR". While in the Constellation Room,
who's this dominating the stamp exhibition?</i>

18:55.010 --> 18:59.014
It is a rare honor to have you here,
Sefior Barboza. Heh.

18:59.222 --> 19:01.850
All the way from the Argentine.
Heh-heh.

19:02.059 --> 19:05.312
I suppose your renowned
Howling Monkey stamp...

19:05.479 --> 19:08.106
...- has been entered for one of the prizes.
- -Ah, yes.

19:09.483 --> 19:10.984
Indeed it has, sefior.

19:11.151 --> 19:15.489
In fact, I expect to walk away
with everything tonight.

19:18.909 --> 19:22.996
Well, it's time to get on
with the judging and the prizes.

19:23.205 --> 19:25.666
- Right this way, Sefior Barboza.
- Thank you.

19:28.627 --> 19:30.545
Now, quiet please. Quiet please.

19:31.338 --> 19:36.176
We have here, ladies and gentlemen,
that famous stamp from Egypt...

19:37.052 --> 19:39.805
...The Inverted Blue Nile.

19:41.807 --> 19:43.266
Wonderful.

19:43.475 --> 19:46.311
There's Gumm in that phony disguise.

19:46.478 --> 19:48.230
The Green Hornet
just came through the service door...

19:48.397 --> 19:50.649
...and the Caped Crusader
through a window.

19:50.816 --> 19:52.401
I'm ready.

19:53.026 --> 19:54.069
Let's make our move.

19:54.277 --> 19:55.529
The Green Hornet!

19:58.240 --> 20:00.826
And the Caped Crusaders.

20:28.478 --> 20:31.732
Good thing those guys are on our side.
Even though they don't know it.

20:38.739 --> 20:41.491
Good thing those guys
aren't in town every week.

21:00.302 --> 21:01.470
<i>NARRATOR".
What do we have here?</i>

21:02.053 --> 21:07.809
<i>A Mexican standoff?
A dead heat? A photo finish?</i>

21:08.018 --> 21:12.439
Stand back. Come on. Now make way,
come on. Stand back. Stand back.

21:23.241 --> 21:29.206
Ah. If it isn't the fuzz
and the pink hostage. She'll come in handy.

21:30.791 --> 21:33.210
Out that window, boys.
We'll come up behind them.

21:38.465 --> 21:39.925
Ah, Miss Pinkston...

21:40.091 --> 21:42.219
- ...permit me to introduce myself.
- Aah!

21:42.385 --> 21:44.137
Don't move, commissioner, nor you, chief.

21:44.513 --> 21:46.306
It's Gumm. Robin.

21:46.515 --> 21:49.684
If anyone makes the slightest move,
Miss Pinkston will be a dead pink duck.

21:49.851 --> 21:51.520
All right, boys, outwith the loot.

21:55.482 --> 21:57.859
Batman can handle this. Let's go.

22:00.487 --> 22:03.406
Out the window, Robin.
We'll come up behind Gumm.

22:11.414 --> 22:13.083
Here's your man.

22:13.625 --> 22:19.548
Miss Pinkston's foreman with assorted aliases
and some sordid stooges.

22:19.756 --> 22:21.174
- We'll run him in.
- Right.

22:21.341 --> 22:23.093
Take them out.

22:28.139 --> 22:29.933
The Green Hornet, he's gone.

22:30.600 --> 22:33.770
He certainly is.
I wonder what he wanted in the first place.

22:33.979 --> 22:35.772
Piece of a counterfeit stamp ring.

22:35.981 --> 22:39.150
Or maybe he meant to uncover
the entire ring. Who knows?

22:39.317 --> 22:41.111
The Green Hornet, a crime-fighter?

22:41.278 --> 22:43.029
Holy unlikelihood.

22:47.075 --> 22:48.702
Me, Batman?

22:48.910 --> 22:52.289
A lot of people think so, Britt,
and that Bruce is The Green Hornet.

22:55.834 --> 22:57.794
Yes, sir. Immediately.

23:02.257 --> 23:03.300
Yes, Batman.

23:03.508 --> 23:06.887
Commissioner, do me a favor.
Miss Pinkston's in the community room.

23:07.053 --> 23:08.805
Would you call her on your regular phone...

23:08.972 --> 23:11.266
...and then hold the two phones together?

23:11.433 --> 23:13.226
Oh, certainly, Batman.

23:18.148 --> 23:21.276
Oh, yeah. 869...

23:21.443 --> 23:25.488
...447.

23:32.537 --> 23:34.164
I wonder what's keeping him.

23:34.372 --> 23:37.208
- Call for you, Miss Pinkston.
-Thank you.

23:37.417 --> 23:39.711
- Hello.
-This is Batman.

23:39.920 --> 23:43.173
- Batman?
-Yes, Miss Pinkston.

23:43.340 --> 23:46.426
I wanna thank you for cooperating
with me and your police department...

23:46.593 --> 23:48.637
...and running down
your felonious foreman...

23:48.845 --> 23:51.973
...and apparently chasing
The Green Hornet out of town.

23:52.182 --> 23:53.892
I did nothing, Batman.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.645
But it was sweet of you to call. Goodbye.

23:56.853 --> 23:58.688
Good bye.

23:58.855 --> 24:01.024
Now does that disapprove
your ridiculous theory?

24:01.232 --> 24:03.068
I guess it does.

24:03.276 --> 24:04.402
Oh, here comes Bruce now.

24:04.569 --> 24:06.947
Please don't tell him,
he'd think I was an awful fool.

24:07.113 --> 24:08.907
That he would, Pinky.

24:09.115 --> 24:11.910
Sorry, my car keys
were in my pocket all the time.

24:12.077 --> 24:13.995
Now, Apricot, as you were saying...

24:14.162 --> 24:16.456
Bruce, you nut. Talking to a dog?
