We are happy to reunite you

00:11.679 --> 00:12.746

Jamal Lyon thinks I'm gorgeous.

00:16.150 --> 00:17.651
Fabulous.
MAN:
This is Franco.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.987
He's the best at

Boom.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.489
I want to see the world
with you, Cook.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.857
I want to write a new page

00:23.891 --> 00:26.460
Hey, I'm calling it off.
You started this.

into building Empire.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.587
Thank you.

00:55.089 --> 00:57.525
Look, there's a lot of me
in Empire.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.393

INTERVIEWER:
And Lucious-- will he be

01:02.730 --> 01:04.332
a part of the special?

01:04.365 --> 01:07.000
This year is Empire's
20th anniversary, so...

01:07.034 --> 01:09.537
(cheering)
You can't speak about

01:09.570 --> 01:12.005
Empire's legacy
without Lucious.

INTERVIEWER:
You and your family have
suffered a great deal

01:33.227 --> 01:35.062
of pain in the
last five months.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.565
Is this anniversary
bittersweet?

01:37.598 --> 01:38.899
(Cookie sighs)

01:38.932 --> 01:41.169
It sure ain't sweet... (laughs)

01:41.202 --> 01:42.736
...when that kind
of pain comes at you,

01:42.770 --> 01:45.906
and it came at us fast
and hard.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.541
And you just do
what you got to do.

01:47.575 --> 01:50.678
You stick together, 'cause
that's what family does, right?

01:50.711 --> 01:51.879

02:03.624 --> 02:05.926
ANDRE:
Yeah, we grew up on it.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.061
Our dad would play it
over and over.

04:51.825 --> 04:54.895
Thank you... Carlotta.

Remember how
you used to tell Mary

05:06.840 --> 05:08.308
how much you
loved her voice?

05:08.342 --> 05:10.243
It was her tone.

05:10.277 --> 05:12.212
Her tone.

05:12.245 --> 05:14.615
Well, she passed.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.216

Oh, we are

05:21.622 --> 05:23.023
I mean, they're a girl group,

05:23.056 --> 05:24.792

to help 'em out.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.326
You know, as a favor to Mary.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.796
Maybe lend one of your producers
to do a couple tracks for 'em.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.364
I mean, y'all got the best ones.

05:30.398 --> 05:31.632

05:33.200 --> 05:35.268
Yeah, but I'm sure
we can do something for them.

05:35.302 --> 05:38.672
I mean, even if it's just for...
for Mary.

05:38.706 --> 05:40.441
Okay, I tell you what.
Call the office,

06:29.523 --> 06:30.991
I got some news.

06:31.024 --> 06:32.860
I'm not your boss.
Look,

06:32.893 --> 06:35.829
Las Vegas PD is coming back
for one more round.

06:35.863 --> 06:38.499
All right, just pro forma,
no biggie.
It's been five months.

06:38.532 --> 06:40.434
I already gave them
my statement, Thirsty.

06:40.468 --> 06:42.570
Well, give it to 'em
again verbatim, all right?

06:42.603 --> 06:44.738
You overheard Giuliana in
the alley behind the club,

06:44.772 --> 06:47.140
popping off at somebody about
how Lucious betrayed her,

06:47.174 --> 06:49.242
and now he was gonna
pay with his life.

06:49.276 --> 06:50.811
She said something
about his car.

06:50.844 --> 06:53.714
Yeah, and that's when
you ran to warn him.

06:56.016 --> 06:58.318
Have they found her yet?
My people

06:58.351 --> 07:00.888
are telling me Vegas PD is
getting ready to bring her in.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.491
All right? This is
good news, right?
(door opens)

07:03.524 --> 07:05.125
BECKY:
I told them we're just
giving news divisions

07:05.158 --> 07:06.426
access for five minutes,

07:06.460 --> 07:08.028
and they're exclusive
for everything else.

07:08.061 --> 07:09.530
THIRSTY:
I'll work it out.

07:09.563 --> 07:11.765
Well, you can tell
MTV and BET

07:11.799 --> 07:13.601
they can threaten
to pull coverage all they want.

07:13.634 --> 07:17.237
I'm not the one bluffing here.
I want every network

07:17.270 --> 07:18.772
to catch Lucious
walking out on that stage,

07:18.806 --> 07:20.107
live and in the flesh.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.374
Cookie, I pushed back
your investment review

07:21.408 --> 07:22.576
so you could do
that press briefing.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.545
(sighs)
Child, did you run it by Andre?

07:24.578 --> 07:26.313
Because I can't do
all that financial,

07:26.346 --> 07:27.748
high-English double-talk
with him.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.116
I'm here, Mom.

07:29.149 --> 07:30.718
Thank you.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.385
It's mainly business press.
They'll throw you

07:32.419 --> 07:33.887
some questions about
when Lucious plans

07:33.921 --> 07:35.388
on coming back
to work.
Why?

07:35.422 --> 07:37.424
Our share prices are high,
our revenue is strong.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.292
Lucious's back catalogue
is more valuable than ever.

07:39.326 --> 07:41.695
Wall Street just
likes to be reassured.

07:41.729 --> 07:43.430
They'll chill after they
see him at the anniversary

07:43.463 --> 07:46.534
concert tomorrow night.
I hope so.

07:46.567 --> 07:47.968
I got to run. I got to
do something real quick.

07:48.001 --> 07:49.302
I'll, uh, be back
in half an hour?

07:49.336 --> 07:50.804
Uh, wait, wait.
I want you to look at something.

07:50.838 --> 07:53.641
Thank you.

07:55.643 --> 07:57.511
This pitch from Big Ten?

07:57.545 --> 07:59.713
Oh, yeah.
Um, I say

07:59.747 --> 08:01.815
we play hard-to-get
until after the anniversary,

08:01.849 --> 08:03.551
then reevaluate.

08:03.584 --> 08:05.653
I say so, too.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.889
Have you heard from Pop?

08:08.922 --> 08:10.490
Are they back from Stanford yet?

08:10.524 --> 08:12.926
Claudia said, um,
everything went well.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.795
They should be landing in 20.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.964
Okay.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.632
Thank you.

08:18.666 --> 08:21.001
Mm.

08:21.034 --> 08:23.671
HAKEEM: * I break the rules
like the government *

08:23.704 --> 08:25.505
* I do it just
for the fun of it. *

08:25.539 --> 08:28.175
What do you think
about that, baby?

08:28.208 --> 08:29.943
You like that song?

08:29.977 --> 08:31.178
The old man might
like it, right?

08:31.211 --> 08:33.714
What about Auntie Di Di?

08:34.948 --> 08:36.483
May I come in?

08:40.520 --> 08:43.657
You didn't show up
for our visit, Hakeem.

08:43.691 --> 08:46.126
I got a lot going on.

08:46.159 --> 08:48.796
Mm-hmm.
I heard about

08:48.829 --> 08:52.499
your family's
Empire Anniversary extravaganza.

08:52.532 --> 08:56.236
So nice to know that
your father's doing so well.

08:56.269 --> 08:57.905
Well, he is,
isn't he?

08:57.938 --> 08:59.339
Yeah, he doing good.
(Bella coos)

08:59.372 --> 09:04.812
Oh, and what about
Bella's mother, Anika?

09:04.845 --> 09:06.179
Still incarcerated?

09:06.213 --> 09:07.681
They denied her bail again.

09:07.715 --> 09:11.084
That was harsh,
but I'm not surprised.

09:11.118 --> 09:13.621
Look, I've been
bringing Bella to you

09:13.654 --> 09:15.488
for the last five months
every Tuesday,

09:15.522 --> 09:17.691
and I still don't know
what you want from me.

09:17.725 --> 09:20.628
Maybe I just want you to keep
bringing Bella to see me.

09:20.661 --> 09:21.895
We done.

09:21.929 --> 09:24.031
I don't think so, dear.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.099
You threatening
to take my baby again?

09:26.133 --> 09:28.636
Now don't get
that twisted.

09:28.669 --> 09:32.405
I'm the one who gave
your baby back to you.
(Bella cooing)

09:32.439 --> 09:34.141
But tell me, Hakeem,
what do you think

09:34.174 --> 09:37.344
your mother would do if
she were to see this?

09:38.846 --> 09:41.649
Or this?

09:41.682 --> 09:44.417
She'd probably beat my
ass like she always do.

09:44.451 --> 09:46.754
But it would hurt her,
wouldn't it?

09:46.787 --> 09:48.155
Consorting with the enemy.

09:48.188 --> 09:50.090
That's the definition
of treason.

09:51.358 --> 09:53.226
That's like taking a knife

09:53.260 --> 09:55.262
and stabbing her in the heart.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.071
I'll see you on Tuesday.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.841
And I'll see you, too, little

10:07.875 --> 10:10.010
boobala.
(makes kissing sound, laughs)

10:12.145 --> 10:14.047
(door closes)

10:14.081 --> 10:16.449
* When I pull up,
they notice me *

10:16.483 --> 10:19.619
* Come and talk to me
like Jodeci *

10:19.653 --> 10:22.756
* But don't you be
too close to me... *

10:22.790 --> 10:25.726
Thirsty tells me the Vegas cops
are about to arrest Giuliana.

10:25.759 --> 10:27.761
(laughs)

10:27.795 --> 10:29.162
It's not possible.

10:29.196 --> 10:31.264
Unless she's on some kind
of zombie tip.

10:31.298 --> 10:34.634
And even then,
zombies don't talk.

10:34.668 --> 10:35.936
Hey, who wants it bloody?

10:35.969 --> 10:37.137
Just one?

10:37.170 --> 10:40.040
You guys are a bunch of weenies.

10:40.073 --> 10:42.642
Then why are they
still investigating?

10:42.676 --> 10:44.812
Somebody is talking, Shine.

10:44.845 --> 10:47.647
Dude.

10:47.681 --> 10:49.616
I got my side of things.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.251
We had a plan.

10:51.284 --> 10:52.986
I cancelled the plan.

10:53.020 --> 10:56.623
Nah. See, we took Lucious out

10:56.656 --> 10:59.492
'cause you said
we'd be running things.

10:59.526 --> 11:01.929
All I see is Cookie
calling the shots.

11:01.962 --> 11:03.263
The board asked
Cookie to stay on

11:03.296 --> 11:04.965
until Lucious gets
back on his feet.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.299
Then they can both announce

11:06.333 --> 11:07.835
they're handing
Empire over to me.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.636
It's gonna happen.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.605
You better hope so.
* 1.8, the option is the roof

11:12.639 --> 11:15.675
* Greens is a secret
to the youth *

11:15.709 --> 11:17.044
* Your goals are malnourished

11:17.077 --> 11:18.645
* Please, spit the juice

11:18.678 --> 11:20.013
* Y'all be Bapein' *

11:20.047 --> 11:21.448
* I be human-made and...

11:21.481 --> 11:23.216
(grunts)

11:23.250 --> 11:26.319
* Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

11:26.353 --> 11:30.157
* Say it like you
really mean it *

11:30.190 --> 11:33.160
* Oh, oh, oh-oh

11:33.193 --> 11:34.995
* Gotta see us to believe it

11:35.028 --> 11:36.696
(chuckles)
Hey.

11:36.730 --> 11:37.931
What's up, handsome?
Hey.

11:37.965 --> 11:39.432
Here's your
father's notebook.

11:39.466 --> 11:41.835
Don't know why I keep on
leaving stuff at your house.

11:41.869 --> 11:43.470
It's textbook psychology.

11:43.503 --> 11:46.206
You clearly wanted to stay
a little while longer.

11:46.239 --> 11:47.374
Like until the sun
came up this morning.

11:47.407 --> 11:48.776
Ain't nobody stuntin' you.

11:48.809 --> 11:49.943
Get up out of here.
(chuckles)

11:49.977 --> 11:51.011
All right, I got to go.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.412
I got a deposition
this morning.

11:53.580 --> 11:54.547
Yo, Warren.

11:54.581 --> 11:55.983
Yes.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.550
Thank you.

11:57.584 --> 11:59.319
Thank you for what?

11:59.352 --> 12:00.888
I don't know.
Bringing the book.

12:00.921 --> 12:02.289
(both chuckle)

12:02.322 --> 12:03.690
But, you know, y-you
didn't know me like that.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.193
and you didn't have to
stick around, but you did.

12:06.226 --> 12:10.663
Haven't asked for anything,
so... thank you.

12:10.697 --> 12:12.699
Well, your dad almost died.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.202
And I'm glad I just could be
the one to be there for you.

12:18.438 --> 12:20.373
*

12:34.587 --> 12:36.356
CLAUDIA:
Hello, Juanita.

12:36.389 --> 12:38.892
Welcome back,
Miss Claudia.

12:40.327 --> 12:41.829
You should have informed me if
the family was gonna be waiting

12:41.862 --> 12:43.563
so that I can prepare him.
JUANITA: Oh, I'm sorry.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.598
I wasn't aware.

12:45.632 --> 12:47.700
Hey.
What's up, Dad?

12:47.734 --> 12:48.735
ANDRE:
Welcome back, Pop.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.137
LUCIOUS:
Hi.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.139
CLAUDIA:
All right, Dwight.
Nice and slow.

13:01.048 --> 13:02.682
Where's his new leg?

13:02.715 --> 13:06.019
Well, it was bothering him,
so he took it off on the plane.

13:06.053 --> 13:07.354
(Lucious grunts)

13:07.387 --> 13:08.288
Uh, Lucious.
What's up, Dad?

13:08.321 --> 13:11.224
Lucious, Thirsty...
Try "Dwight."

13:11.258 --> 13:12.592
Huh?

13:12.625 --> 13:13.793
Dwight.

13:13.827 --> 13:14.962
Thirsty said it
was an emergency.

13:14.995 --> 13:18.098
(grunts)
Oh. Um,

13:18.131 --> 13:21.468
I'm really sorry,
Cookie, but I've...

13:21.501 --> 13:23.003
I'm afraid I've changed my mind.
I won't be able

13:23.036 --> 13:24.337
to participate in your show.

13:24.371 --> 13:26.139
No, no.

13:26.173 --> 13:29.176
Uh, we made this
announcement weeks ago.

13:29.209 --> 13:32.279
Look, there are millions
of people waiting

13:32.312 --> 13:35.082
to watch Lucious Lyon
walk out on that stage.

13:35.115 --> 13:37.017
That's not me.

13:38.118 --> 13:39.953
I don't even know
who that is.

13:39.987 --> 13:42.755
(sighs)
Sorry.

13:42.789 --> 13:44.124
(grunting):
All right.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.865
LUCIOUS:
Physically, I can't walk
that far yet.

13:51.899 --> 13:53.901
And my leg hurts too much.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.768
Well, use your crutches,

13:55.802 --> 13:57.704
or we'll wheel your ass
out there.

13:57.737 --> 13:58.838
Mom.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.141
(sighs)

14:01.174 --> 14:03.343
Lucious, if you don't show up
on that stage,

14:03.376 --> 14:04.878
the board will have questions.

14:07.881 --> 14:09.149
CLAUDIA:
It's okay.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.517
Maybe, um,

14:10.550 --> 14:13.520
let's not make this
about your board.

14:13.553 --> 14:17.024
It's not my board, okay?

14:17.057 --> 14:19.659
It's mine and Lucious's.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.261
Uh, look. Can I talk
to you for a minute?

14:26.733 --> 14:28.768
I thought you said
he'd be ready for this.

14:28.801 --> 14:31.304
I said it could be possible,
Cookie.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.306
But that's up to Dwight.

14:33.340 --> 14:35.642
Now, see, Dwight--

14:35.675 --> 14:38.211
He calls himself Dwight,
but that...

14:38.245 --> 14:40.147
not wanting to walk out
on stage talk?

14:40.180 --> 14:43.816
That is Lucious's
bullheaded pride coming through.

14:43.850 --> 14:47.620
No. Cognitive rehabilitation
is an unpredictable process.

14:47.654 --> 14:50.523
It's about him
setting the pace.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.459
And I've told
you this before,

14:52.492 --> 14:54.494
if you push too hard,
it could backfire.

14:54.527 --> 14:55.862
HAKEEM:
You know that word.

14:57.364 --> 14:59.566
He keeps saying he won't walk
out on stage

14:59.599 --> 15:01.201
because he can't pretend.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.802
He doesn't remember anything.

15:02.835 --> 15:06.173
Is it possible that we can just
make him remember something?

15:06.206 --> 15:08.175
...this about electricity
and magnetism...

15:08.208 --> 15:09.909
Please.

15:12.012 --> 15:13.913
*

15:16.349 --> 15:20.187
* Say it like you
really mean it *

15:20.220 --> 15:22.855
* Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh

15:22.889 --> 15:25.925
* They got to see it
to believe it *

15:25.959 --> 15:28.161
*

15:29.129 --> 15:31.999
* Baby, we're still undefeated *

15:32.032 --> 15:33.967
* Ah-ah...
(door opening)

15:34.001 --> 15:36.636
You sound fantastic.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.840
Look, I just wanted to...

15:40.873 --> 15:42.509
I've been working
on the 12 steps

15:42.542 --> 15:43.977
and I just wanted to come
and make amends, okay?

15:44.011 --> 15:45.745
I'm sorry.
Please.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.480
I am trying to work
right now, and I cannot do this.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.482
I got her. Now is
not a good time, okay?

15:49.516 --> 15:50.783
I had a dream about
you last night.

15:50.817 --> 15:52.752
You were licking my...
BECKY: Mm-mm.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.154
...my toes.
Uh-uh. Come on.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.356
Ew.

15:56.389 --> 15:58.391
Here, start at the top.

15:58.425 --> 16:00.727
Let's do it again.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.795
CLAUDIA:
You know, hearing your music
might spark a memory for you.

16:02.829 --> 16:04.631
Would you like to try
listening to this?

16:04.664 --> 16:06.633
What I would like
is one of those cookies.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.935
The little ones.
I think we can
arrange that.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.371
But, Dad, this right here,

16:11.404 --> 16:13.140
this is OG, old-school
Lucious Lyon.

16:13.173 --> 16:15.042
It's your very first CD.
*

16:15.075 --> 16:18.511
It's still one of the best rap
records of all time, Dad.

16:18.545 --> 16:19.746
COOKIE:
Here's all the
family photo albums.

16:19.779 --> 16:22.449
Oh, I need to look
those over before.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.584
Make sure there isn't
anything that's disruptive.

16:24.617 --> 16:28.788
Ah, I already did. We good.

16:28.821 --> 16:32.292
"I hear that sound,
I look around.

16:32.325 --> 16:35.628
Her body's on the floor,
blood all around."

16:35.662 --> 16:37.764
Are all my songs this violent
and hateful?

16:37.797 --> 16:40.500
W-Why would I write
something like this?

16:41.501 --> 16:43.836
Would you like to see Bella?

16:43.870 --> 16:45.438
Yes. Where's Bella?

16:45.472 --> 16:46.873
She's very soothing for him.

16:46.906 --> 16:48.608
Yeah, we already know that.

16:48.641 --> 16:51.511
Um, Hakeem, why don't you
go get Juanita and tell her

16:51.544 --> 16:53.146
to bring the baby down
if she's finished napping.

16:53.180 --> 16:54.347
Yo, Juanita!
COOKIE: Hey.

16:54.381 --> 16:55.448
Bring Bella down!

16:55.482 --> 16:57.284
I coulda did that, boy.

16:57.317 --> 16:58.651
I like her mother.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.288
Who's she?

17:01.321 --> 17:02.389
I think he means Tiana.

17:02.422 --> 17:03.523
HAKEEM:
She's rehearsing, Dad.

17:03.556 --> 17:04.957
She's performing
with us tomorrow.

17:04.991 --> 17:05.925
(Cookie clears her throat)

17:05.958 --> 17:08.328
I know you didn't
bring Tiana over here.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.862
Nobody's supposed to see him

17:09.896 --> 17:11.898
in that condition except family.

17:11.931 --> 17:14.101
It's Tiana. I trust her.

17:14.134 --> 17:15.535
CLAUDIA:
Well, look who's here.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.937
Hey, boo-boo.
Somebody's standing.

17:17.970 --> 17:20.107
Hi, boo. Did
you sleep well?
(Lucious babbles)

17:20.140 --> 17:21.574
Come on. Show me.

17:21.608 --> 17:22.775
Yay, clap for me.

17:22.809 --> 17:24.944
Clap for this.
Yay.

17:24.977 --> 17:28.415
It's on you, now.
It's all you.

17:28.448 --> 17:29.649
Yes.

17:29.682 --> 17:30.883
Come here.
COOKIE:
Lucious, why don't you

17:30.917 --> 17:32.119
take a look at those pictures?

17:32.152 --> 17:34.454
Hakeem, grab Bella.

17:42.362 --> 17:46.065
You know what I notice
in all of these albums,

17:46.099 --> 17:50.203
I don't see your picture
in most of them.

17:50.237 --> 17:52.272
Were you taking them?

17:57.677 --> 17:59.746
Remember, I told you,
there was a, um,

17:59.779 --> 18:02.249
great chunk of time
that we spent apart.

18:02.282 --> 18:04.551
How long?

18:08.855 --> 18:10.557
17 years.

18:16.363 --> 18:18.198
17 years, huh?

18:24.971 --> 18:26.806
BECKY:
I hope this has
been helpful.

18:26.839 --> 18:28.708
THIRSTY:
Got everything we need.
Thank you so much, Becky.

18:28.741 --> 18:30.543
Car bombing.

18:30.577 --> 18:32.078
I don't know about
you guys, but that,

18:32.111 --> 18:33.713
that seems like a
terrorist attack, no?

18:33.746 --> 18:35.415
I mean, who does car bombing
anymore?

18:35.448 --> 18:38.851
Hey, Becky.
What's good?
Hey.

18:38.885 --> 18:41.288
Are those the Las Vegas cops
you were in there talking to?

18:41.321 --> 18:42.455
Yeah. I told them
you did it.

18:42.489 --> 18:45.458
(chuckles)
You funny.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.026
What'd they ask
you, for real?

18:47.059 --> 18:48.361
Same as before.

18:48.395 --> 18:50.129
Um, except this time,
they were pressing me

18:50.163 --> 18:51.564
about some wannabe
pop stars.
Hmm.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.633
They thought I might have
scouted them.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.034
Like who?

18:55.067 --> 18:58.471
I don't know.
Uh, Jimmy Partridge,

18:58.505 --> 19:00.006
Bug Masters

19:00.039 --> 19:03.776
and Franco Gianni.
Oh, you know him?

19:03.810 --> 19:05.645
Franco?
Uh, nah.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.547
Uh, you know I
don't do pop stars.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.216
I'm into that
hardcore hip-hop.

19:09.249 --> 19:10.983
But, anyway, you're
looking good, woman.

19:11.017 --> 19:13.586
What's up? Let's get some
drinks some time, you and me.

19:13.620 --> 19:14.821
No, thanks.

19:14.854 --> 19:17.123
But you are welcome to watch
the view as I walk away.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.658
(chuckles)

19:24.564 --> 19:26.466
WARREN:
All right, I'm
getting closer,

19:26.499 --> 19:28.335
but he's still got
some barriers up.

19:28.368 --> 19:30.136
Please, it's been five months.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.904
You promised
to have him mesmerized

19:31.938 --> 19:33.606
by your prowess by now.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.942
He's still preoccupied by what's
happening with his father

19:35.975 --> 19:38.911
and then they
got this concert...
Excuses, excuses.

19:38.945 --> 19:41.781
Tools of the incompetent
used to build monuments

19:41.814 --> 19:43.082
to nothingness.

19:43.115 --> 19:44.451
You reminding me of your father,
Warren.

19:44.484 --> 19:46.486
I'm nothing like my father!

19:47.554 --> 19:48.788
Alex,

19:48.821 --> 19:51.224
would you wait for me
in the next room, please?

19:56.128 --> 19:58.197
Just so we're clear,

19:58.231 --> 20:01.634
I don't give a flying fig about
complications with his father.

20:01.668 --> 20:04.704
Cookie Lyon ruined
my life's work

20:04.737 --> 20:06.739
and my son's future

20:06.773 --> 20:09.008
and sullied the family name.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.210
Now, I intend to
see that she suffers

20:11.244 --> 20:15.348
threefold for that by destroying
each of her offspring.

20:15.382 --> 20:18.685
I will pick the meat
from their bones

20:18.718 --> 20:21.087
as she watches helplessly.

20:22.689 --> 20:24.391
You got that?

20:24.424 --> 20:27.394
Yeah.

20:27.427 --> 20:30.330
I won't let,
I won't let you down.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.701
Alex, you can come back now.

20:39.539 --> 20:42.842
*

20:42.875 --> 20:46.012
SHINE:
Becky said the cops are asking
about the bomb maker.

20:46.045 --> 20:48.848
ANDRE:
Franco? I thought you said
he was cool.

20:48.881 --> 20:51.250
"You're not supposed to hear
about guys like me

20:51.284 --> 20:52.685
if we do our jobs right."

20:52.719 --> 20:53.753
Hey, cheap seats.

20:53.786 --> 20:54.754
You don't get to give me orders.

20:54.787 --> 20:56.255
Hold up.

20:57.624 --> 21:00.226
You do your job
and I'll do mine.

21:02.194 --> 21:03.830
(exhales)

21:03.863 --> 21:05.432
Damn it.

21:05.465 --> 21:09.201
Okay, so we need three rows
of reserved seats for the...

21:09.235 --> 21:11.438
board of directors.

21:13.773 --> 21:14.907
Becky, let me call you back.

21:14.941 --> 21:16.743
You-you got this.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.345
(sighs)

21:18.378 --> 21:21.013
Can I kiss you?
(laughs)

21:34.827 --> 21:36.429
Okay. You got 30 minutes

21:36.463 --> 21:38.331
to pack your bags and
kick rocks, bitch.

21:38.365 --> 21:40.467
Excuse me?
No, no, no.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.401
You are not excused.

21:41.434 --> 21:42.902
I know what you're up to.

21:42.935 --> 21:44.303
I saw you and Lucious.

21:44.337 --> 21:46.639
I don't think you understand
what you saw.

21:46.673 --> 21:49.342
Yeah. Well, it doesn't take
a rocket scientist

21:49.376 --> 21:52.311
or a PhD to figure out
you're up to something.

21:52.345 --> 21:53.780
Look, it's a common occurrence.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.382
It's called "transference."

21:55.415 --> 21:58.818
He's redirecting his feelings
and his desires onto me

21:58.851 --> 22:00.920
in order to explore them safely.

22:00.953 --> 22:02.689
Can you speak English?

22:03.956 --> 22:06.926
His memories are blocked
because...

22:06.959 --> 22:08.260
well, they're ugly,

22:08.294 --> 22:09.429
and he can't face them.

22:09.462 --> 22:10.563
Oh, so all his memories
are ugly,

22:10.597 --> 22:11.831
that's what you're saying.

22:11.864 --> 22:13.099
He don't have
no good memories

22:13.132 --> 22:14.333
rattling 'round
in there.

22:14.367 --> 22:17.136
They're just tied up
with the bad ones.

22:17.169 --> 22:19.105
I mean, if he trusts me,
he'll let me lead him

22:19.138 --> 22:20.773
back to those memories.

22:20.807 --> 22:24.777
But for a while, he may confuse
that trust with something else.

22:24.811 --> 22:26.245
(chuckles)

22:26.278 --> 22:29.382
Lucious has had a lot of
something elses in his life.

22:29.416 --> 22:32.051
He's had a hard time
keeping 'em in his pants.

22:37.890 --> 22:39.526
Okay.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.631
(Cookie sighs)

22:46.633 --> 22:47.667
Hey.

22:48.668 --> 22:49.936
Hey.

22:49.969 --> 22:52.672
How are you?

22:52.705 --> 22:54.641
Good.

22:56.576 --> 22:58.678
Look, uh...

23:00.279 --> 23:02.749
...I didn't mean
to disappoint you.

23:04.150 --> 23:05.752
It's all right.

23:05.785 --> 23:07.554
You can't help it.

23:11.057 --> 23:12.224
(sniffles)

23:12.258 --> 23:14.393
It's just, I see you

23:14.427 --> 23:17.464
trying and working so hard.

23:18.931 --> 23:21.200
I just don't understand it.

23:21.233 --> 23:22.735
It's because
that's who we are, Lucious.

23:22.769 --> 23:24.236
Or who we were.

23:24.270 --> 23:26.639
We're fighters.

23:26.673 --> 23:28.975
We get knocked down,
we get back up.

23:29.008 --> 23:31.110
It's just how we do.

23:32.945 --> 23:34.380
It's...

23:35.615 --> 23:37.316
I really thought...

23:37.349 --> 23:40.286
that we had won,
that night in Vegas.

23:40.319 --> 23:42.288
Mmm.

23:44.223 --> 23:46.659
Was that the night of the...

23:46.693 --> 23:48.227
accident?

23:51.430 --> 23:55.101
You gave me everything
I've ever wanted that night.

23:56.469 --> 23:58.404
I know you don't
remember, but...

23:58.437 --> 24:01.273
You could tell me about it,
if you like.

24:03.309 --> 24:05.411
I'd like to hear it.

24:07.914 --> 24:10.617
You sang me this song...

24:10.650 --> 24:14.020
just to me.

24:14.053 --> 24:15.888
And it made me feel really...

24:15.922 --> 24:17.524
blessed.

24:17.557 --> 24:19.091
Special.

24:21.794 --> 24:24.396
Then you asked me
to travel the world with you.

24:26.265 --> 24:28.635
And you, um, you told our sons

24:28.668 --> 24:30.603
how much you love them.

24:30.637 --> 24:33.573
And we gave Andre the company.

24:33.606 --> 24:35.575
Andre.
Yeah.

24:35.608 --> 24:36.876
He's a strong one.

24:36.909 --> 24:39.078
He's a good son.

24:39.111 --> 24:41.881
I like him.

24:43.983 --> 24:46.118
Then what happened?

24:52.825 --> 24:54.961
Did somebody do this to me?

25:06.939 --> 25:09.642
Did I do something

25:09.676 --> 25:12.244
to make this happen to me?

25:13.713 --> 25:16.849
I can't remember.

25:16.883 --> 25:19.518
Why can't I remember?

25:19.552 --> 25:21.520
Lucious.

25:23.690 --> 25:25.324
You saved my life.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.059
Okay?

25:27.093 --> 25:28.728
When you could have...

25:28.761 --> 25:30.863
chosen your own life,

25:30.897 --> 25:32.531
you saved mine.

25:32.565 --> 25:35.034
You did a good thing.

25:35.067 --> 25:37.670
And so that's
how this happened to you.

25:37.704 --> 25:41.373
And... that is why
I'm fighting so hard

25:41.407 --> 25:43.075
to get you back.

25:44.210 --> 25:47.313
It's okay.
Don't cry, Cookie.

25:54.386 --> 25:56.422
JUANITA: Will there be
anything else, sir?
COOKIE: Uh, do you have

25:56.455 --> 25:58.658
some real food?
'Cause I'm not a rabbit.
(classical music playing)

25:58.691 --> 26:00.727
I'm sorry, that's what
Ms. Claudia likes

26:00.760 --> 26:03.062
for him to eat.
Ms. Claudia.

26:03.095 --> 26:06.032
I'm getting sick
of Ms. Claudia's ass, okay?

26:06.065 --> 26:07.033
(scoffs)

26:07.066 --> 26:09.035
Is she always like this?

26:09.068 --> 26:10.136
Always.

26:10.169 --> 26:12.839
I like that.

26:12.872 --> 26:14.874
COOKIE: Well, now that she's
letting us talk for real,

26:14.907 --> 26:16.876
what do you want
to know, Lucious?

26:16.909 --> 26:20.546
It's funny, I look, and it's...

26:20.579 --> 26:22.815
I see,
Hakeem, you have

26:22.849 --> 26:25.251
your daughter Bella
and Tiana.

26:25.284 --> 26:27.086
Andre.

26:27.119 --> 26:28.821
Who do you have?

26:28.855 --> 26:30.957
Do you have
someone special?

26:33.292 --> 26:34.827
I had a wife.

26:36.028 --> 26:37.529
She died.

26:37.563 --> 26:39.632
I'm sorry.

26:40.933 --> 26:42.802
That's sad.
When did that happen?

26:45.037 --> 26:47.206
Long time ago.

26:49.108 --> 26:51.243
What about you, Jamal?

26:51.277 --> 26:53.579
Someone special in your life?

26:53.612 --> 26:55.614
Yeah, I'm, uh...

26:55.648 --> 26:57.216
I'm seeing someone.

26:57.249 --> 26:58.617
Have I met him?

26:58.651 --> 27:01.353
What makes you think it's a him?

27:01.387 --> 27:02.621
I'm sorry.

27:02.655 --> 27:03.890
It's not?

27:03.923 --> 27:05.958
No, it's a him, Dad, it's fine.

27:07.493 --> 27:08.661
It's, uh...

27:08.695 --> 27:10.096
uh, you never met him.

27:10.129 --> 27:11.130
I like him.

27:11.163 --> 27:12.965
But I'm taking it slow,
you know?

27:12.999 --> 27:14.133
Why?

27:14.166 --> 27:17.670
I mean, if you like him
and he likes you, and...

27:17.704 --> 27:19.271
you're good for each other...

27:19.305 --> 27:21.073
Do you know how short life is?

27:23.109 --> 27:25.577
Is it because of me?

27:27.446 --> 27:29.415
You see, love is, um...

27:29.448 --> 27:30.917
love is,

27:30.950 --> 27:33.119
um, uh...

27:33.152 --> 27:34.754
It's love.

27:34.787 --> 27:36.022
Exactly.

27:37.389 --> 27:38.624
Lucious. Uh...

27:39.358 --> 27:40.326
Dwight.

27:40.359 --> 27:41.527
Have you,
uh, had a chance

27:41.560 --> 27:43.195
to listen
to any of your music?

27:43.229 --> 27:45.765
Did it bring back any memories?

27:45.798 --> 27:47.033
See, that's
the problem.

27:47.066 --> 27:48.634
You know, I've...

27:48.667 --> 27:50.469
I try, I try

27:50.502 --> 27:53.439
to listen to 'em, but most
of the songs, they just...

27:53.472 --> 27:56.475
they gave me
a most terrible headache.

27:57.476 --> 27:59.011
Like a migraine.

27:59.045 --> 28:01.347
But there was this
one song, man, there was

28:01.380 --> 28:03.415
one song that...

28:03.449 --> 28:04.717
Mr. Webb,

28:04.751 --> 28:07.353
um, can-can you,
um...

28:07.386 --> 28:09.822
what's... have whoever's
in charge of the music

28:09.856 --> 28:11.490
play that song
that I love,

28:11.523 --> 28:14.093
you know,
over the loudspeaker?

28:14.126 --> 28:15.361
The one from that album

28:15.394 --> 28:16.863
where I've got
the l-lipstick on.

28:16.896 --> 28:18.798
Um, and bring
that album cover

28:18.831 --> 28:20.099
for me, please.
Will do.

28:20.132 --> 28:21.700
I'll have them play it
right away, sir.

28:21.734 --> 28:25.337
Music change. Play
album four, track five.

28:25.371 --> 28:29.441
* Yesterday I had a dream
that we were family *

28:29.475 --> 28:31.043
Yeah, that's it.

28:31.077 --> 28:32.779
* I woke up,
you weren't next to me *

28:32.812 --> 28:35.514
* What happened to you...
Tell me about

28:35.547 --> 28:37.516
when I wrote
this one.

28:37.549 --> 28:39.886
* We're like ivory and ebony *

28:39.919 --> 28:41.387
* I should be
next to you-ou-ou-ou *

28:41.420 --> 28:42.789
* Okay, okay

28:42.822 --> 28:44.556
What's wrong?
Thank you.

28:44.590 --> 28:46.058
(whooshing)

28:46.092 --> 28:48.560
* Oh, oh, oh

28:48.594 --> 28:50.162
* Okay, we gon'
stop listenin'... *

28:50.196 --> 28:51.530
COOKIE:
Yesterday I had a dream

28:51.563 --> 28:54.700
we were a family.

28:54.733 --> 28:57.669
(sniffs) And I woke up
and you weren't next to me.

28:57.703 --> 28:59.538
* No more fighting, fighting

28:59.571 --> 29:01.573
(sighs deeply)

29:01.607 --> 29:02.909
(sniffles)

29:02.942 --> 29:04.210
* Love me

29:04.243 --> 29:06.012
Love me.

29:06.045 --> 29:07.479
* I just want...

29:07.513 --> 29:09.882
Why can't you just love me?

29:09.916 --> 29:11.383
* Family

29:11.417 --> 29:12.551
* I woke up...

29:12.584 --> 29:13.853
Mom wrote this song.

29:13.886 --> 29:15.387
Jamal.

29:15.421 --> 29:16.856
Why can't he know it?

29:16.889 --> 29:18.858
I'm saying it's-it's
a happy memory.

29:18.891 --> 29:20.359
Thank you.
JAMAL:
You were working on

29:20.392 --> 29:22.194
your fourth album
and you had this...

29:22.228 --> 29:23.762
massive block.

29:23.796 --> 29:25.331
And it was driving you crazy.

29:25.364 --> 29:27.499
ANDRE: Well, not crazy,
uh, literally,

29:27.533 --> 29:28.868
but...
(chuckles)

29:28.901 --> 29:31.037
...you were very frustrated.
JAMAL: Anyway.

29:31.070 --> 29:32.538
It was Mom's idea
to change your sound.

29:32.571 --> 29:34.273
She was all like,

29:34.306 --> 29:35.674
(imitates Cookie):
"Ain't no reason why a rapper

29:35.707 --> 29:37.076
can't sing a love song."

29:37.109 --> 29:38.878
(Lucious laughs)

29:40.346 --> 29:43.382
So, she wrote you a love song.

29:43.415 --> 29:44.817
This love song.

29:44.851 --> 29:46.418
LUCIOUS:
It's a Bunkie

29:46.452 --> 29:49.121
and Vernon Turner

29:49.155 --> 29:50.456
record.

29:51.457 --> 29:53.425
I don't see
your n...

29:53.459 --> 29:56.495
Where's your name
on the credits?

29:58.364 --> 30:00.232
COOKIE:
That's because it, um,

30:00.266 --> 30:03.435
it was important for Empire

30:03.469 --> 30:04.937
and for your fans

30:04.971 --> 30:07.606
to think the song
was written by you.

30:07.639 --> 30:09.208
But that's
the only song,

30:09.241 --> 30:10.576
in a-all of your albums,

30:10.609 --> 30:12.044
that-that you didn't write.

30:12.078 --> 30:14.847
Baby, that...
that's-that's not right.

30:14.881 --> 30:18.350
How'd that make you feel--
not being given credit

30:18.384 --> 30:20.052
for what you did?

30:20.086 --> 30:21.487
It's wrong.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.055
Is everything

30:23.089 --> 30:25.557
all right
over here?
We're fine, Claudia.

30:25.591 --> 30:28.294
Yeah. Uh, just-just
answer the question.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.729
Do you think you need
to take a break?
No, no.

30:30.762 --> 30:32.198
I want you to answer
the question,

30:32.231 --> 30:33.665
please.

30:33.699 --> 30:34.901
Why we can't
just tell him

30:34.934 --> 30:36.335
the damn truth?
Because we're not

30:36.368 --> 30:37.503
supposed to talk about

30:37.536 --> 30:39.338
anything painful, Hakeem.

30:39.371 --> 30:41.173
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?

30:41.207 --> 30:43.609
All right? You always pretending
that you better than us.

30:43.642 --> 30:45.344

I understand.
We're limited to a shallow well

30:55.821 --> 30:57.623

It's okay.

30:57.656 --> 30:59.625
ANDRE: Leaves us with nothing
to talk about. That's okay.

30:59.658 --> 31:01.460
I just think
maybe this isn't the time.

31:01.493 --> 31:02.962
Don't tell us what to do
in this house, okay?

31:02.995 --> 31:05.331
Lucious Lyon was a mack.

31:05.364 --> 31:06.865
The biggest don in the game.

(cheering, whooping)

39:23.829 --> 39:26.465
*

39:26.498 --> 39:32.538
* Why can't we see
the bigger picture? *

39:32.571 --> 39:34.540
* Mmm

39:34.573 --> 39:36.575
*

39:36.608 --> 39:38.276
* Hey

39:38.309 --> 39:40.979
* I just want love,
I just want love *

39:41.012 --> 39:43.915
* I just want you to love me
Yes!

39:47.185 --> 39:50.055
* Yesterday, I had a dream
that we were family *

39:50.088 --> 39:52.891
* I woke up,
you weren't next to me *

39:52.924 --> 39:56.728
* What'd I do to you? Damn,
I kind of miss your energy *

39:56.762 --> 39:59.097
* Don't know how you got *

39:59.130 --> 40:02.200
* The best of me, baby,
but you do *

40:02.233 --> 40:04.870
* No, I'm not perfect,
no, you're not perfect *

40:04.903 --> 40:06.171
* Baby, I know that I can be

40:06.204 --> 40:09.307
* Petty, petty, petty, petty

40:09.340 --> 40:11.409
* Baby, I'm worth it,
baby, you're worth it *

40:11.443 --> 40:14.746
* I don't know why we got to be
messy, messy, messy *

40:14.780 --> 40:16.882
* Messy

40:16.915 --> 40:21.052
* The way I miss you,
it should be against the law *

40:21.086 --> 40:23.489
* I'd do anything
to be with you tomorrow *

40:23.522 --> 40:28.894
* It don't matter,
'cause I'm gonna keep it loyal *

40:28.927 --> 40:31.262
* Hold you now, hey

40:31.296 --> 40:33.865
* 'Cause you're my life,
I just want love *
* You're my life *

40:33.899 --> 40:37.669
* I just want love,
I just want you to love me *
Hakeem!

40:37.703 --> 40:40.371
* Is that a crime?
* Is that a crime?

40:40.405 --> 40:42.708
* I just want love,
I just want love *

40:42.741 --> 40:43.709
* I just want you to love me

40:43.742 --> 40:44.710
What's the matter, woman?

40:44.743 --> 40:46.244
You forgot the words?

40:46.277 --> 40:49.380
* I just want love,
I just want love *

40:49.414 --> 40:54.119
* I just want you to love me,
yeah, love me, yeah *

40:54.152 --> 40:56.788
* Love, yesterday,
I had a dream that we were *
* Uh

40:56.822 --> 41:00.592
* High school sweetheart
valentines, I don't want *

41:00.626 --> 41:03.629
* To leave you, baby, 'cause
you took a while to find *

41:03.662 --> 41:07.232
* Make me want to overstay my
visit till we're out of time *

41:07.265 --> 41:10.536
* Love you more than people love
to see a dollar sign *

41:10.569 --> 41:13.572
* Love is all that we need,
love is all that we need *

41:13.605 --> 41:18.343
* Don't be petty,
petty, petty, petty... *

41:18.376 --> 41:20.445
(line ringing)

41:20.478 --> 41:23.982
(phone ringing)
(indistinct chatter)

41:27.352 --> 41:29.788
I thought you were coming
to the taping.

41:29.821 --> 41:31.456
Just handling some business.

41:31.489 --> 41:34.159
I was supposed to go in
tomorrow and cut a deal,

41:34.192 --> 41:36.595
but I hate office buildings.

41:36.628 --> 41:37.929
I'm going to the Bahamas.

41:37.963 --> 41:39.765
Damn, the Bahamas. Hey,

41:39.798 --> 41:42.133
you know where else is
nice this time of year?
Hmm?

41:42.167 --> 41:44.102
Hell.

41:48.506 --> 41:50.508
I'll call you back.

41:50.542 --> 41:52.510
I hate snitches.

42:15.333 --> 42:18.003
Thank you.

42:20.338 --> 42:22.908
That was... that was perfect.

42:22.941 --> 42:24.710
That wasn't me, Cookie.

42:24.743 --> 42:29.014
I was faking, just like you
and I practiced last night.

42:29.047 --> 42:30.548
It was you.

42:30.582 --> 42:32.550
Look, I promise you, Lucious,

42:32.584 --> 42:34.853
you are still in there.

42:38.523 --> 42:40.458
I wish I could remember.

42:42.027 --> 42:44.395
I just don't.

42:46.064 --> 42:47.899
Where's Claudia?

42:47.933 --> 42:49.100
I'm right here.

42:51.603 --> 42:53.538
I'm ready to go home now.

42:53.571 --> 42:54.673
Okay.

42:54.706 --> 42:56.842
We're ready.

43:01.246 --> 43:02.513
Lucious.

43:04.683 --> 43:07.152
You're gonna remember me.

43:07.185 --> 43:10.155
I'm Cookie Lyon, baby.
I'm unforgettable.

43:56.968 --> 43:59.270
Empire has music, drama, and
attitude.

43:59.304 --> 44:01.606
Stick around for more
on the season premiere of Star.

44:45.683 --> 44:47.452
MAN:
Background starting at the top.

44:47.485 --> 44:49.120
WOMAN:
Back to one.

44:49.154 --> 44:51.389
And action.

44:51.422 --> 44:53.324
(music playing over speakers)

45:04.335 --> 45:06.337
* Life gets hard

45:06.371 --> 45:07.505
* You gave it up

45:09.741 --> 45:12.310
* Now, baby, why you do it
when you do it too much? *

45:14.746 --> 45:17.248
* You want to break me down
to build me up *

45:20.385 --> 45:21.686
* But never did I ever think

45:21.719 --> 45:23.221
* You'd do me like that

45:25.556 --> 45:28.359
* You want to love me stranded

45:30.128 --> 45:34.432
* But love doesn't need
a hostage *

45:36.001 --> 45:38.870
* It's like I gave too much

45:38.904 --> 45:40.738
* I don't want to work
too hard *

45:40.772 --> 45:43.441
* I ain't thinkin' 'bout you

45:43.474 --> 45:46.244
* No, no

45:46.277 --> 45:49.447
* I ain't thinkin 'bout you

45:49.480 --> 45:52.483
* No, no

45:52.517 --> 45:55.520
* Now, I make time for what
I want to make time for *

45:57.355 --> 45:59.057
* But I ain't got time

45:59.090 --> 46:01.059
* For what I didn't ask for

46:02.928 --> 46:04.062
* No energy left

46:04.095 --> 46:05.530
* For all this

46:05.563 --> 46:07.698
* Love and war

46:07.732 --> 46:10.235
* And when you tell me
it's not fair *

46:10.268 --> 46:11.970
* So is the way
you ain't grown yet *

46:12.003 --> 46:13.805
* Uh, uh

46:13.839 --> 46:16.307
* You want to love me stranded

46:18.576 --> 46:21.746
* But love doesn't
need an exit *

46:21.779 --> 46:23.114
* No, no, no

46:23.148 --> 46:26.051
* It's like I gave too much

46:26.084 --> 46:29.254
* I don't want to work no more

46:29.287 --> 46:32.123
* I ain't thinkin' 'bout you

46:32.157 --> 46:34.192
* No, no

46:34.225 --> 46:35.593
* No, ooh

46:37.495 --> 46:39.297
* I'm gonna push

46:39.330 --> 46:41.632
* Yeah, I'm pushing on

46:41.666 --> 46:44.169
* I'm gonna push,
I'm pushing on *

46:44.202 --> 46:46.604
-(discordant music playing)
-Push.

46:46.637 --> 46:47.939
Come on, we need you
to push this baby out!

46:47.973 --> 46:49.740
Yes, yes!

46:49.774 --> 46:50.942
-(laughing): Yes!
-ROSE: Oh, it's a boy!

46:50.976 --> 46:52.277
(baby crying)

46:55.780 --> 46:57.548
CARLOTTA:
You had a baby boy, Star.

46:57.582 --> 46:59.250
You got this.

46:59.284 --> 47:00.618
ARLENE:
You're wrong, sister Carlotta.

47:00.651 --> 47:02.753
Move, I got this.

47:02.787 --> 47:04.122
Move.

47:05.256 --> 47:06.858
You took my kid,

47:06.892 --> 47:07.926
I'm taking yours.

47:09.294 --> 47:10.962
Clean yourself up.

47:10.996 --> 47:12.964
No!

47:12.998 --> 47:15.000
(panting)

47:16.401 --> 47:17.969
You all right?

47:18.003 --> 47:22.874
Yeah, I just keep having
these... damn dreams.

47:22.908 --> 47:25.076
Girl, you know you went in
last night, Star.

47:25.110 --> 47:26.978
(chuckles softly)

47:27.012 --> 47:28.646
Did I?

47:28.679 --> 47:30.916
And, you know,
I've never done this before

47:30.949 --> 47:31.917
with a new artist.

47:33.885 --> 47:36.454
-You legal?
-Yeah.

47:36.487 --> 47:39.490
Well, you're like...

47:39.524 --> 47:42.793
the second dude
I've ever been with.

47:42.827 --> 47:44.195
Really?

47:44.229 --> 47:45.496
Wow.

47:45.530 --> 47:47.098
I know that's crazy.

47:47.132 --> 47:48.666
Well, I like to get to know my

47:48.699 --> 47:50.001
artists on my label

47:50.035 --> 47:52.103
pretty intimately.

47:52.137 --> 47:53.771
That's crazy 'cause...

47:53.804 --> 47:55.440
me and my group have been
at your label

47:55.473 --> 47:57.675
for five months,
and nobody there

47:57.708 --> 47:59.677
seems to be trying
to get to know us.

47:59.710 --> 48:01.846
Our album is almost done, and
every single one of your A&Rs

48:01.879 --> 48:03.781
is a ghost.

48:03.814 --> 48:05.216
What's up with that?

48:05.250 --> 48:07.185
Can't keep people around?

48:07.218 --> 48:09.187
I'm looking for
an international vibe.

48:09.220 --> 48:12.157
And if you ain't on that
"Despacito" overseas sound,

48:12.190 --> 48:13.758
put your clothes on.

48:13.791 --> 48:16.061
Forget international, man.

48:16.094 --> 48:18.163
We're the best thing
you got on the label.

48:18.196 --> 48:20.031
We just won Atlanta NextFest
five months ago.

48:20.065 --> 48:21.666
We're a girl group.

48:21.699 --> 48:23.001
Our job is to make an album--

48:23.034 --> 48:24.269
we did that-- your job

48:24.302 --> 48:25.570
is to give it a drop date

48:25.603 --> 48:26.904
and a small tour.

48:28.239 --> 48:29.240
Large mountain to climb.

48:33.011 --> 48:34.279
Shouldn't be too hard.

48:40.118 --> 48:42.420
Listen to this...

48:42.453 --> 48:44.055
and call me.

48:44.089 --> 48:45.690
* I bring me

48:45.723 --> 48:47.858
* Get mine, 'bout mine,
go hard *

48:47.892 --> 48:49.194
* Looking for another like me

48:49.227 --> 48:50.361
* Boy, stop

48:50.395 --> 48:51.862
* I bring me

48:51.896 --> 48:53.198
* Whose love is the tightest?

48:53.231 --> 48:54.432
* Whose kiss is the nicest?

48:54.465 --> 48:55.866
* Me

48:55.900 --> 48:57.202
* Whose touch is the rightest?

48:57.235 --> 48:59.937
* I bring me

48:59.971 --> 49:03.074
* I bring, I bring me.

49:03.108 --> 49:05.376
(sobbing loudly)

49:06.777 --> 49:09.847
Carlotta Brown for Lucious.

49:09.880 --> 49:11.816
Bruce, I'm on the damn phone.

49:11.849 --> 49:12.917
(sobbing continues)

49:15.053 --> 49:17.255
Hello, yes.

49:17.288 --> 49:19.590
Um, Lucious was going
to hook me up

49:19.624 --> 49:21.592
with one of Empire's
top producers and...

49:21.626 --> 49:23.594
(screeching, sobbing)

49:23.628 --> 49:25.230
Well, just have him
call me back.

49:25.263 --> 49:27.765
Thank you.

49:27.798 --> 49:29.967
Would you give that child
a piece of candy or something?

49:30.001 --> 49:33.271
-Please. -Sit your ass still,
little girl.

49:33.304 --> 49:35.806
You know my baby's
tender-headed, Bruce.

49:35.840 --> 49:37.142
Your baby ain't no damn
tender-headed, she nappy-headed,

49:37.175 --> 49:37.842
that's what she is.

49:39.810 --> 49:41.579
Bitch!

49:41.612 --> 49:44.782
(women laughing)

49:44.815 --> 49:46.584
(laughing)

49:46.617 --> 49:48.453
Bitch.

49:48.486 --> 49:50.788
You just let Janice clock you.

49:50.821 --> 49:52.757
-And you even--
you just took it. -(scoffs)

49:52.790 --> 49:54.959
It is the opening
of my foundation.

49:54.992 --> 49:56.994
-Who next?
-Bruce, turn this up.

49:57.028 --> 49:58.496
ARLENE:
The Hunter Morgan Foundation.

49:58.529 --> 50:00.065
Turn up the TV.

50:00.098 --> 50:01.599
ARLENE:
Very big day.

50:01.632 --> 50:04.169
I hope that, um, everybody

50:04.202 --> 50:06.271
from all the news stations
will be there.

50:06.304 --> 50:08.806
REPORTER: It's been five months
since the triple-murder

50:08.839 --> 50:11.876
of Hunter Morgan, Eva Resendez,
and Jahil Rivera.

50:11.909 --> 50:13.944
MISS BRUCE: I miss
that little brown come-up.

50:13.978 --> 50:15.813
*

50:15.846 --> 50:18.316
Still can't believe
how it happened.

50:18.349 --> 50:22.120
(heart beating)

50:22.153 --> 50:25.656
Imagine somebody walking
into your own damn house

50:25.690 --> 50:27.625
and then mowing your ass down.

50:31.529 --> 50:33.564
(gunshot, heartbeat stops)

50:36.033 --> 50:38.336
REPORTER: While Atlanta Police
released a statement months ago,

50:38.369 --> 50:41.072
authorities are not speaking
to the press at this time.

50:41.106 --> 50:43.508
Arlene Morgan, mother
of the victim Hunter Morgan,

50:43.541 --> 50:47.212
will be hosting a gala for her
foundation tomorrow night

50:47.245 --> 50:48.579
in honor of her son.

50:48.613 --> 50:51.682
STAR: Did they find out
who killed them yet?

50:51.716 --> 50:53.851
Not yet.

50:53.884 --> 50:54.885
REPORTER: Four Confederate
monuments were taken down...

50:54.919 --> 50:56.354
Where you been?

50:56.387 --> 50:57.622
I was out advancing our careers.

50:59.257 --> 51:00.791
Somebody has to.

51:00.825 --> 51:02.360
I was just about to head over
to the label

51:02.393 --> 51:04.262
and check in with the A&R rep.

51:04.295 --> 51:07.198
So I don't need you to stay out
all night advancing nothing.

51:07.232 --> 51:08.966
You wouldn't even know
where I was all night

51:08.999 --> 51:12.036
if I still had my own house.

51:12.069 --> 51:15.039
No, you mean that dead white
boy's house that was rented.

51:15.072 --> 51:16.941
Lying ass. And wash yours

51:16.974 --> 51:20.178
-before you sit at that table.
-CARLOTTA: Bruce, stop.

51:20.211 --> 51:21.546
I got enough going on
with your sister.

51:21.579 --> 51:23.314
I'm fighting to get her back.

51:23.348 --> 51:25.516
I don't need to be worried
about you in jail,

51:25.550 --> 51:26.584
or God knows what.

51:28.553 --> 51:30.588
I keep having this baby dream.

51:30.621 --> 51:32.790
That's the Lord telling you
you need to close your legs.

51:34.492 --> 51:36.694
Mm-hmm. Just like that.

51:36.727 --> 51:37.995
Perfect.

51:38.028 --> 51:40.165
Now stay.

51:40.198 --> 51:43.368
Stay. Stay.

51:43.401 --> 51:46.337
-(laughs) Stay. -Dreaming about
babies is bad omen.

51:46.371 --> 51:48.773
Dream babies and real babies
ain't to be trusted.

51:48.806 --> 51:49.740
Shut up, Bruce.

51:53.411 --> 51:55.112
-STAR: Hey.
-Hey.

51:55.146 --> 51:58.783
-Need some help?
-Nah, I'm good.

51:58.816 --> 52:01.118
My mom's coming later.
She wants to help me settle in.

52:01.152 --> 52:03.120
Well, you can come home
any time, you know.

52:03.154 --> 52:05.223
Can you hold this?

52:05.256 --> 52:07.192
STAR:
Moving in with Derek

52:07.225 --> 52:09.894
is a big step;
it means taking care of him.

52:11.262 --> 52:13.631
Star.

52:13.664 --> 52:16.066
Yes.

52:16.100 --> 52:17.468
Did you love him?

52:17.502 --> 52:20.037
Yeah, I loved Hunter.

52:20.070 --> 52:21.406
And it was overrated.

52:23.274 --> 52:24.275
But now my head is in the game.

52:24.309 --> 52:26.244
We're releasing an album.

52:26.277 --> 52:28.979
And, without Hunter,
I don't have any distractions.

52:29.013 --> 52:31.081
Derek is not a distraction,
okay?

52:31.115 --> 52:34.084
Okay.
Well, you have a lot going on.

52:34.118 --> 52:37.121
And you had a miscarriage that
you won't even talk about...

52:37.154 --> 52:39.156
Don't you have
to pick Simone up?

52:41.859 --> 52:43.994
(indistinct conversations)

52:57.208 --> 52:59.377
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

53:02.680 --> 53:04.515
Signing out.

53:04.549 --> 53:06.116
Be back by 10:00 p.m., Davis.

53:06.150 --> 53:07.518
Don't make me call the cops.

53:09.687 --> 53:12.022
(laughing):
She gonna be calling the cops!

53:12.056 --> 53:13.023
(both giggle)

53:13.057 --> 53:14.792
(Simone squealing)

53:19.063 --> 53:21.098
Are you high?

53:21.131 --> 53:22.333
-No.
-Simone.

53:23.901 --> 53:26.871
-No, I'm not high.
-You're a liar.

53:26.904 --> 53:29.340
I've been in there, I know
exactly what goes on in there.

53:29.374 --> 53:31.342
Okay, well, I wouldn't even
be-- be in here

53:31.376 --> 53:32.677
if Miss Carlotta didn't have
a previous record.

53:32.710 --> 53:34.579
Don't you dare blame
Miss Carlotta.

53:34.612 --> 53:36.347
You are in there because you
were smoking weed in school

53:36.381 --> 53:39.049
like an idiot, stupid.

53:41.185 --> 53:43.288
-She's trying to get you out of
there. -Tell her to try harder.

53:43.321 --> 53:46.524
The foster kid system
can't even find me a home.

53:48.092 --> 53:51.562
My plan right now is to get
the label to give us a tour.

53:51.596 --> 53:54.164
That way they'll give you a
work release to get out of here.

53:54.198 --> 53:57.268
But how? We don't even have
a drop date for our album.

54:04.775 --> 54:07.445
I met with the label president
last night.

54:07.478 --> 54:10.981
(both laugh)

54:11.015 --> 54:13.183
-You slept with him.
-(cackles)

54:13.217 --> 54:16.220
-Why are you screaming?
-You slept with him.

54:16.253 --> 54:17.755
I did not say that.

54:17.788 --> 54:20.358
-Yes, you did, ho.
-No, I didn't.

54:20.391 --> 54:22.192
* And I'm admitting it

54:22.226 --> 54:23.528
-* I won't take it back
-You can't do that.

54:23.561 --> 54:24.862
* 'Cause I did it

54:24.895 --> 54:26.063
* I was a ho.

54:26.096 --> 54:28.098
(both laugh)

54:28.132 --> 54:29.934
We had a meeting today.

54:29.967 --> 54:32.337
And just in case you forgot,
you are our A&R rep,

54:32.370 --> 54:33.971
and you haven't even
heard the music.

54:36.574 --> 54:38.108
Fired?

54:38.142 --> 54:41.078
So who is our new A&R rep?

54:41.111 --> 54:42.547
Mr. Holland, hey.

54:42.580 --> 54:44.582
It's Carlotta Brown,
with Big Trouble.

54:44.615 --> 54:46.083
We're still working
on a new name.

54:46.116 --> 54:47.485
You know, Star hand-delivered me

54:47.518 --> 54:48.853
that music last night.

54:48.886 --> 54:51.522
And when I tell you
she's talented,

54:51.556 --> 54:54.459
I mean a talented young lady.

54:54.492 --> 54:56.894
Yeah, I bet you see talent
like that every night.

54:56.927 --> 54:58.729
Who?

54:58.763 --> 54:59.897
Me...

55:03.267 --> 55:06.771
I don't do that.

55:06.804 --> 55:08.406
Look, the music ain't
that good anyway, all right?

55:08.439 --> 55:10.408
-I-I'm looking for a hit.
-Well...

55:10.441 --> 55:11.842
to be fair about this,

55:11.876 --> 55:13.378
we've been working
with your producers.

55:13.411 --> 55:14.745
Now, I got some producers
out of New York

55:14.779 --> 55:16.447
that make nothing but hits.

55:16.481 --> 55:17.948
If you would just let us
go up there with them

55:17.982 --> 55:19.950
for a couple of weeks,
knock this thing out,

55:19.984 --> 55:21.386
-we could get this done...
-Hey, hey, hey, look,

55:21.419 --> 55:23.087
look, y'all are all out of time.

55:23.120 --> 55:24.855
They're having
a big board meeting tomorrow.

55:24.889 --> 55:27.492
They're trying to get rid
of their dead weight.

55:27.525 --> 55:28.926
Okay, so what if we have
a hot track

55:28.959 --> 55:30.294
for you by tomorrow?

55:30.327 --> 55:33.030
Before your meeting.

55:33.063 --> 55:35.800
That could work.
Maybe.

55:35.833 --> 55:37.768
Okay, well,
then you'll have one.

55:37.802 --> 55:38.969
(stammers)
Good luck with that.

55:48.212 --> 55:51.148
I need to bring
my interior decorator here.

55:51.181 --> 55:52.783
We could be sitting on lice.

55:52.817 --> 55:53.884
Mom...

55:53.918 --> 55:56.654
Well, we could.

55:56.687 --> 55:58.956
Anyway, I think I packed
your velvet hangers.

55:58.989 --> 56:01.426
I'm not sure if I could have
put it in this box or...

56:01.459 --> 56:03.628
Wire hangers are okay, Mom.

56:03.661 --> 56:05.663
Look, I know this is
Trump's America,

56:05.696 --> 56:07.632
but we still need to have
our standards.

56:11.335 --> 56:13.704
I'm very concerned about you.

56:13.738 --> 56:15.640
You're neglecting yourself.

56:15.673 --> 56:18.643
I know this has been a difficult
few months with Derek,

56:18.676 --> 56:20.811
but you matter, too.

56:20.845 --> 56:21.979
You had a miscarriage.

56:24.381 --> 56:26.684
Can we...
Can we not?

56:26.717 --> 56:28.052
You know, when I first
married your father,

56:28.085 --> 56:29.053
it was all about him.

56:29.086 --> 56:31.088
His music, his needs.

56:31.121 --> 56:33.658
I thought if I made him happy,
I'd be happy, too.

56:33.691 --> 56:36.727
And that thinking drove me
to the bottle.

56:36.761 --> 56:38.395
Are you listening
to me, darling?

56:38.429 --> 56:40.698
Cotton's getting out of prison.

56:40.731 --> 56:42.633
She's having wings over at her
place-- you should come.

56:42.667 --> 56:44.535
Wings?

56:44.569 --> 56:47.438
I'll be at the Carlton.
Come by after.

56:47.472 --> 56:50.508
Mom, come on.

56:50.541 --> 56:52.009
All right.

56:52.042 --> 56:54.411
If you want me there,
I'm there.

56:56.714 --> 56:58.048
But this house needs
to be redone.

56:58.082 --> 57:00.050
It is really...

57:00.084 --> 57:01.919
MISS BRUCE:
Girl, Cotton gonna be mad at me

57:01.952 --> 57:03.387
bringing you down here.

57:03.420 --> 57:06.190
She wanted to surprise you.

57:06.223 --> 57:08.926
I ain't got no time for no more
of Cotton's surprises.

57:08.959 --> 57:11.195
MISS BRUCE: Don't Cotton stay
on some type of stunt?

57:11.228 --> 57:13.063
I can't with that girl, honey.

57:13.097 --> 57:14.732
Ain't no telling how she's
gonna come out here looking.

57:20.404 --> 57:21.506
MISS BRUCE:
Cott!

57:23.407 --> 57:24.742
Sorry I couldn't come visit.

57:24.775 --> 57:25.776
Bitch, I wasn't coming
back down here.

57:25.810 --> 57:28.112
Mmm.

57:28.145 --> 57:31.248
Ooh. Mmm.

57:31.281 --> 57:33.283
I got to wash this hair.

57:33.317 --> 57:34.451
-Hey, Mama.
-Hey, baby.

57:36.353 --> 57:37.555
(Carlotta chuckles)

57:37.588 --> 57:39.389
Damn.

57:39.423 --> 57:40.991
Girl, how much trade
you had in there?

57:41.025 --> 57:43.360
Shut up, Bruce.

57:43.393 --> 57:44.662
Come on, let's get you home.

57:44.695 --> 57:46.430
I ain't used to you
being shorter than me.

57:46.463 --> 57:48.198
You ain't got no heels on,
ain't got no hair.

57:48.232 --> 57:50.501
Ooh.

57:50.535 --> 57:52.737
Don't flop down
in my seat like that.

57:52.770 --> 57:56.073
I'm sorry. I know this must be
very difficult for you.

57:57.642 --> 58:00.678
You have no idea
how difficult this is.

58:05.315 --> 58:07.217
How'd you get a jury record?

58:07.251 --> 58:09.620
Never mind that, sweetheart.

58:09.654 --> 58:13.490
She's killed before.
(sniffles)

58:13.524 --> 58:16.160
And I'm not talking about
her sister's foster father.

58:16.193 --> 58:17.427
(sniffing)

58:20.464 --> 58:22.166
You just call me "sweetheart"?

58:22.199 --> 58:24.434
Excuse me?

58:24.468 --> 58:26.303
Did you just call me
"sweetheart"?

58:30.040 --> 58:31.842
Mama, I'm good.
Go handle your business

58:31.876 --> 58:32.977
with the girls.

58:33.010 --> 58:34.278
Them girls will be all right.

58:34.311 --> 58:37.782
I want to get you settled first.

58:37.815 --> 58:40.217
I even bought you
some new lipstick.

58:41.786 --> 58:43.387
Keys?

58:43.420 --> 58:45.656
To Jahil's car.

58:45.690 --> 58:49.459
I know it's no consolation for
missing his memorial service,

58:49.493 --> 58:51.295
but it's a piece of him.

58:51.328 --> 58:52.997
(sighs)

58:53.030 --> 58:55.733
Things ain't been the same
without you around here.

58:55.766 --> 58:59.269
Shoot, Bruce driving me batty.

58:59.303 --> 59:02.707
And they took Simone
because of my record.

59:06.543 --> 59:08.713
How bad was it?

59:08.746 --> 59:10.514
Prison's prison, Mama.

59:10.547 --> 59:12.950
Ain't nothing changed.

59:12.983 --> 59:14.785
(cries out)

59:14.819 --> 59:16.654
-Come on.
-(laughter)

59:16.687 --> 59:20.324
Help! I want to go
to the men's side!

59:20.357 --> 59:22.860
I know what it's like
to be alone in there.

59:24.528 --> 59:26.731
I wasn't alone.

59:26.764 --> 59:28.833
-(lock buzzes)
-MAN: Sweet thing.

59:28.866 --> 59:30.835
MAN 2: What up, baby girl?
Come get some of this here.

59:30.868 --> 59:32.136
You looking like a snack.
Let me get a bite.

59:32.169 --> 59:34.071
(wolf whistle)

59:37.875 --> 59:40.244
You sure you want
to transfer to gen pop?

59:40.277 --> 59:41.511
* Send me your location

59:41.545 --> 59:43.047
* Let's focus on communicating

59:43.080 --> 59:46.250
* 'Cause I just need
the time and place *

59:46.283 --> 59:47.384
* To come through

59:47.417 --> 59:49.687
* Place to come through

59:49.720 --> 59:52.089
-GUARD: Welcome home.
-* Send me your location...

59:52.122 --> 59:53.691
Yeah, welcome home.

59:53.724 --> 59:56.093
* Let's ride the vibrations

59:56.126 --> 59:58.428
* I don't need
nothing else but you... *

59:58.462 --> 1:00:00.097
(scoffs)

1:00:00.130 --> 1:00:01.331
Yeah, God takes care of you
wherever you are.

1:00:01.365 --> 1:00:03.333
Now, get yourself together

1:00:03.367 --> 1:00:06.570
so you can make
your grand entrance.

1:00:06.603 --> 1:00:08.038
A lot of people
waiting to see you.

1:00:08.072 --> 1:00:10.540
* Send me your location

1:00:10.574 --> 1:00:14.178
* Let's ride the vibrations

1:00:14.211 --> 1:00:17.581
* I don't need
nothing else but you... *

1:00:17.614 --> 1:00:20.084
-Study long, study wrong,
baby boy. -Mm-mm.

1:00:20.117 --> 1:00:21.351
That's one for Bruce?

1:00:21.385 --> 1:00:23.420
I got something for you.

1:00:23.453 --> 1:00:26.456
I'm just saying, though,
think about it.

1:00:26.490 --> 1:00:28.425
Two brown people got killed
with Hunter Morgan,

1:00:28.458 --> 1:00:30.761
and just 'cause
it's Hunter Morgan,

1:00:30.795 --> 1:00:32.562
that's the only reason
they're still reporting on it.

1:00:32.596 --> 1:00:34.631
Yeah, and that's the same thing
happened to that young boy

1:00:34.665 --> 1:00:37.601
out in Chicago, and the news
didn't cover that.

1:00:37.634 --> 1:00:39.569
-Hey, Unc.
-Hey, baby girl.

1:00:39.603 --> 1:00:40.971
-How you doing?
-Good.

1:00:41.005 --> 1:00:41.939
-Good, good, good.
-Cotton!

1:00:41.972 --> 1:00:43.573
Cott!

1:00:43.607 --> 1:00:45.876
-She's here!
-Hey, gorgeous.

1:00:45.910 --> 1:00:48.512
Cott!
She's arrived!

1:00:48.545 --> 1:00:50.214
(indistinct chatter)

1:00:50.247 --> 1:00:52.783
Yo, nephew, what's this, man?

1:00:54.484 --> 1:00:57.421
You know I'm not
with this, nephew, man.

1:00:57.454 --> 1:00:59.289
-I'm going upstairs, man.
-Unc...

1:00:59.323 --> 1:01:02.492
I'm going upstairs.
This... Please. Excuse me!

1:01:02.526 --> 1:01:06.263
Bye... Unc.

1:01:06.296 --> 1:01:09.466
STAR: You look good,
but you're late, per usual.

1:01:09.499 --> 1:01:11.201
Girl, now, you know you can't
fight a femme-appointed time.

1:01:11.235 --> 1:01:13.503
-Now, move over.
-At least you're consistent.

1:01:13.537 --> 1:01:14.739
What's the tea, Cott?

1:01:14.772 --> 1:01:16.206
Girl, oh...

1:01:16.240 --> 1:01:17.708
Oh, I got next.

1:01:17.742 --> 1:01:20.845
All we used to do is
slap bones in the joint.

1:01:20.878 --> 1:01:22.847
Oh, I'm sure you slapped more
than one bone, honey.

1:01:22.880 --> 1:01:24.715
-STAR: Ew, Bruce.
-(laughter)

1:01:24.749 --> 1:01:26.116
What y'all talking about?

1:01:26.150 --> 1:01:28.518
Injustice in America.
You know it.

1:01:28.552 --> 1:01:30.320
That's all over
for you now, Cott.

1:01:30.354 --> 1:01:32.957
I wish. I got to see
my probation officer

1:01:32.990 --> 1:01:35.960
once a week, drug test,

1:01:35.993 --> 1:01:37.828
and then I got to pay back
Elliot the 20 stacks I stole.

1:01:39.296 --> 1:01:41.165
How can he even expect you
to get 20 grand?

1:01:41.198 --> 1:01:43.934
(exclaims in Spanish)

1:01:43.968 --> 1:01:46.436
* Do-Do-Do-Don't
take advantage *

1:01:46.470 --> 1:01:48.839
* Don't leave my heart damaged

1:01:48.873 --> 1:01:51.441
(groans)

1:01:51.475 --> 1:01:54.912
* A little bit better
when you plan it... *

1:02:02.519 --> 1:02:04.354
Man, what it feel like
not to be able to walk?

1:02:06.791 --> 1:02:09.894
How it feel to be a freak?

1:02:09.927 --> 1:02:12.129
Derek.

1:02:12.162 --> 1:02:14.832
Where's Simone?

1:02:21.571 --> 1:02:22.873
I'm sorry.

1:02:27.011 --> 1:02:29.713
Here, put a little ranch sauce
on it this time.

1:02:29.746 --> 1:02:31.681
Ooh...

1:02:31.715 --> 1:02:33.583
God, they're good.

1:02:36.086 --> 1:02:38.022
(laughter)

1:02:40.891 --> 1:02:42.927
How they been treating you
at that place, little girl?

1:02:42.960 --> 1:02:43.727
Horrible.

1:02:46.831 --> 1:02:49.867
Should have never taken you
away from Carlotta's.

1:02:49.900 --> 1:02:51.435
ROSE: They can do
a random drug test on her.

1:02:51.468 --> 1:02:54.304
You should not be encouraging
that child to smoke.

1:02:54.338 --> 1:02:57.041
All you got to do is drink
a little coconut water.

1:02:57.074 --> 1:02:58.142
She'll be okay.
(laughing)

1:02:58.175 --> 1:03:00.710
CARLOTTA:
Simone.

1:03:00.744 --> 1:03:02.146
Give me... oh.

1:03:02.179 --> 1:03:04.114
Get in the house.

1:03:04.148 --> 1:03:05.850
Ruby, you lucky you drunk.

1:03:05.883 --> 1:03:07.684
I'd bust your ass
right now for that.

1:03:07.717 --> 1:03:08.752
Hey, you better
step back, bitch.

1:03:11.822 --> 1:03:14.724
Mom, are you serious?

1:03:14.758 --> 1:03:16.961
You're eating chicken wings
right now?

1:03:16.994 --> 1:03:19.129
They're so divine.

1:03:19.163 --> 1:03:20.898
They are.

1:03:20.931 --> 1:03:24.668
Miss Ruby, you really
smoking out my sister?

1:03:24.701 --> 1:03:27.404
You better procreate yourself
somewhere else.

1:03:27.437 --> 1:03:29.039
You better get out
of here, white girl.

1:03:29.073 --> 1:03:30.274
You don't have
any old-ass friends?

1:03:30.307 --> 1:03:31.175
You better move it!

1:03:32.309 --> 1:03:33.410
All right.

1:03:37.514 --> 1:03:38.782
How am I supposed
to get you back

1:03:38.815 --> 1:03:40.584
if you're smoking weed
outside my house?

1:03:40.617 --> 1:03:42.319
-Okay, I know.
-This is pointless,

1:03:42.352 --> 1:03:43.820
'cause she doesn't even care.

1:03:43.854 --> 1:03:46.823
Well, so is sleeping
with the label president, Star.

1:03:46.857 --> 1:03:47.925
Wait, what?

1:03:47.958 --> 1:03:49.826
You heard me.

1:03:49.860 --> 1:03:51.595
I'm trying to get
an album release date for us

1:03:51.628 --> 1:03:53.931
so that I can get her a work
release from that group home.

1:03:53.964 --> 1:03:56.967
That's not how you get respect
as a woman in this business,

1:03:57.001 --> 1:03:59.003
sleeping with some dude
that look like Mike Epps.

1:03:59.036 --> 1:04:01.771
Oh, my God, he does
look like Mike Epps.

1:04:01.805 --> 1:04:03.673
Star don't care
about no respect.

1:04:03.707 --> 1:04:05.642
All she cares about
is being famous.

1:04:05.675 --> 1:04:07.444
-And what do you care about,
Simone? -(laughter)

1:04:07.477 --> 1:04:09.446
I'm serious.
Alex, it's not funny.

1:04:09.479 --> 1:04:11.681
But it is.

1:04:11.715 --> 1:04:14.018
-I'm okay.
-Simone, you're not okay.

1:04:14.051 --> 1:04:16.386
Neither are you,
ever since Hunter died.

1:04:22.059 --> 1:04:24.828
Holland listened to the music.

1:04:24.861 --> 1:04:26.330
He said there's not one hit.

1:04:26.363 --> 1:04:27.664
That's because
they've been putting us

1:04:27.697 --> 1:04:30.034
with wack-ass producers
for months.

1:04:30.067 --> 1:04:31.701
Well, we're
on the chopping block.

1:04:31.735 --> 1:04:33.803
He wants to hear
a new song by tomorrow-- a hit.

1:04:33.837 --> 1:04:35.639
STAR: Okay, so get us
some studio time.

1:04:35.672 --> 1:04:37.441
We don't have time
for studio time.

1:04:37.474 --> 1:04:39.076
We're gonna do this
right here, right now.

1:04:39.109 --> 1:04:40.210
-Write this thing...
-Right here?

1:04:40.244 --> 1:04:41.378
Yeah, write it in the kitchen.

1:04:41.411 --> 1:04:43.880
That's right.
Go get a laptop.

1:04:43.914 --> 1:04:45.849
Real funny.

1:04:45.882 --> 1:04:47.017
STAR:
I like that.

1:04:48.418 --> 1:04:50.020
I got some questions for you.

1:04:50.054 --> 1:04:51.688
I need you to come
down to the station.

1:04:51.721 --> 1:04:53.223
For what?

1:04:53.257 --> 1:04:54.458
The murder of Hunter Morgan.

1:05:02.099 --> 1:05:04.868
Star... my old friend.

1:05:04.901 --> 1:05:06.070
I miss you.

1:05:06.103 --> 1:05:07.904
I miss Otis.

1:05:07.938 --> 1:05:10.707
Oh, funny girl, huh?

1:05:10.740 --> 1:05:12.742
-(chuckles)
-STAR (on monitor): Watch this!

1:05:12.776 --> 1:05:16.746
(shrieking)

1:05:16.780 --> 1:05:18.548
That's some good work.

1:05:18.582 --> 1:05:21.518
So why am I here?
'Cause I have someplace to be.

1:05:21.551 --> 1:05:22.652
You said he beat you,
but the truth is

1:05:22.686 --> 1:05:24.321
you never reported it.

1:05:24.354 --> 1:05:26.856
And now we have a source
that's providing evidence

1:05:26.890 --> 1:05:29.693
that's challenging
your veracity.

1:05:29.726 --> 1:05:30.427
I know what that is--
my juvie records are

1:05:30.460 --> 1:05:31.861
supposed to be sealed.

1:05:31.895 --> 1:05:33.863
Yeah, we're able
to take a little peek.

1:05:33.897 --> 1:05:36.300
And you seem to have a history
of violent behavior.

1:05:36.333 --> 1:05:38.102
Since you were 12.

1:05:38.135 --> 1:05:40.204
You know what I have?

1:05:40.237 --> 1:05:43.940
Every picture of every time
that man put his hands on me.

1:05:43.974 --> 1:05:45.942
I have every weak-ass
text message, too,

1:05:45.976 --> 1:05:47.811
saying he was sorry.

1:05:47.844 --> 1:05:49.079
And the only reason that
you haven't seen these photos

1:05:49.113 --> 1:05:50.714
is because he is dead,

1:05:50.747 --> 1:05:52.849
and I know he couldn't
hurt anybody else.

1:05:52.882 --> 1:05:56.386
Every man I've ever known
has left me, or worse.

1:05:56.420 --> 1:06:01.391
And what I did when I was 12,
when I was surviving,

1:06:01.425 --> 1:06:05.129
that has nothing to do with the
fact that that man beat my ass.

1:06:05.162 --> 1:06:08.532
How is that for veracity?

1:06:18.775 --> 1:06:20.477
You can go.

1:06:22.612 --> 1:06:25.315
(door opens and closes)

1:06:32.622 --> 1:06:34.291
(exhales)

1:06:34.324 --> 1:06:37.227
(sniffles)

1:06:37.261 --> 1:06:38.962
You'd have thought
I was gone for ten years

1:06:38.995 --> 1:06:41.065
the way y'all done
messed my books up.

1:06:41.098 --> 1:06:43.800
(chuckles) Girl, that's your
mama, trying to get her coin.

1:06:43.833 --> 1:06:45.535
She got behind
on all them bills.

1:06:45.569 --> 1:06:47.771
Behind how?

1:06:47.804 --> 1:06:51.141
She had to mortgage the salon
to pay for your lawyer.

1:06:51.175 --> 1:06:53.343
*

1:06:53.377 --> 1:06:58.282
* Only rock with bad bitches,
bad bitches in my circle *

1:06:58.315 --> 1:07:00.016
* Nothing but bad bitches,
bad bitches... *

1:07:00.050 --> 1:07:01.518
You guys hear me?

1:07:01.551 --> 1:07:03.087
-Yeah.
-I think I found

1:07:03.120 --> 1:07:04.521
the perfect name for the song.

1:07:04.554 --> 1:07:06.290
"Bad Bish."

1:07:06.323 --> 1:07:07.657
"Bish"?

1:07:07.691 --> 1:07:08.925
Are you saying "bish"?

1:07:08.958 --> 1:07:10.760
-Yeah, "bish."
-Really?

1:07:10.794 --> 1:07:12.096
-ALEXANDRA: Yeah.
-Yeah, it's like, it's "bitch,"

1:07:12.129 --> 1:07:14.898
-but with a "sh," like, shh.
-STAR: Simone.

1:07:14.931 --> 1:07:17.467
I know what it's supposed
to mean.

1:07:17.501 --> 1:07:19.035
-Like "Shh."
-STAR: I think it's... Shh!

1:07:19.069 --> 1:07:21.205
I think it's corny.

1:07:21.238 --> 1:07:23.006
Well, how about you come up with
a suggestion, then, smartass?

1:07:23.039 --> 1:07:24.241
How about, uh, "Bitch"?

1:07:24.274 --> 1:07:25.875
Just the regular word?

1:07:25.909 --> 1:07:27.144
The way it is?

1:07:27.177 --> 1:07:28.678
Okay, can we use
our adult voices?

1:07:28.712 --> 1:07:30.046
I mean, who cares
what it's called?

1:07:30.080 --> 1:07:31.348
Let's just finish the record.

1:07:31.381 --> 1:07:32.416
SIMONE:
You have us working in here

1:07:32.449 --> 1:07:33.650
like there's no
child labor laws.

1:07:33.683 --> 1:07:35.852
Simone, we're in a girl group.

1:07:35.885 --> 1:07:37.887
-This is what we do.
-Oh, I can't take this.

1:07:37.921 --> 1:07:38.922
Something's wrong with the song.

1:07:38.955 --> 1:07:40.023
We got to speed it up
or something.

1:07:40.056 --> 1:07:43.026
Can we try 120 BPM?

1:07:43.059 --> 1:07:44.661
Alex, why are you back
on that damn phone?

1:07:44.694 --> 1:07:46.463
Don't you know
how important this is?

1:07:46.496 --> 1:07:49.065
-Because I have to call Derek.
-That boy's a distraction.

1:07:49.099 --> 1:07:51.568
Don't start. I really don't need
that from you.

1:07:51.601 --> 1:07:53.970
Okay, maybe we can come in
faster with the drums, Anthony.

1:07:54.003 --> 1:07:56.673
Or maybe if Star wasn't so fast
with the label president,

1:07:56.706 --> 1:07:58.542
we wouldn't be in this position
in the first place.

1:07:58.575 --> 1:08:00.710
At least I was trying to do
something to get us ahead.

1:08:00.744 --> 1:08:02.512
-Come on, y'all.
-ALEXANDRA: And look at you.

1:08:02.546 --> 1:08:03.680
You're on your phone now, huh?

1:08:03.713 --> 1:08:06.383
I'm on my phone telling Cotton,

1:08:06.416 --> 1:08:07.951
"No, we can't go out tonight,

1:08:07.984 --> 1:08:10.086
-because we are in the studio
working." -Okay.

1:08:10.120 --> 1:08:12.589
Give me the phone. Come on.

1:08:12.622 --> 1:08:15.592
Don't say nothing weird
or embarrassing, or...

1:08:15.625 --> 1:08:18.195
-(phone beeps) -CARLOTTA:
We 'bout it, 'bout it tonight.

1:08:18.228 --> 1:08:20.564
-Definitely coming thoo. -STAR:
You're doing that on purpose.

1:08:20.597 --> 1:08:23.099
-It's gonna be lit.
-(laughs) Okay.

1:08:23.133 --> 1:08:24.268
Come on, y'all need to go out.

1:08:24.301 --> 1:08:25.802
Y'all done hit a wall.

1:08:25.835 --> 1:08:28.438
Go have some fun.
Get-get inspired.

1:08:28.472 --> 1:08:30.740
Me and your mother
always used to do it.

1:08:30.774 --> 1:08:33.410
I mean, you heard the lady,
let's get "lit."

1:08:33.443 --> 1:08:34.778
CARLOTTA:
You ain't going nowhere.

1:08:34.811 --> 1:08:36.646
(groans)

1:08:36.680 --> 1:08:38.882
-You got a curfew.
-Great.

1:08:38.915 --> 1:08:41.751
Guess I'm-a go out with yo' ass.

1:08:41.785 --> 1:08:44.254
(both laugh)

1:08:44.288 --> 1:08:45.755
*

1:08:45.789 --> 1:08:48.692
Yeah, I know,
it's our first night, I'm sorry.

1:08:48.725 --> 1:08:50.260
DEREK (over phone):
No, don't be sorry.

1:08:50.294 --> 1:08:52.596
You got to finish your song.

1:08:52.629 --> 1:08:54.531
Can you hurry home tonight?

1:08:54.564 --> 1:08:57.100
'Cause...

1:08:57.133 --> 1:08:59.303
I was thinking of trying
some physical therapy.

1:08:59.336 --> 1:09:00.904
-Oh, were you?
-Yes, I was.

1:09:00.937 --> 1:09:01.971
Alex.

1:09:02.005 --> 1:09:03.407
Okay, well,

1:09:03.440 --> 1:09:04.974
I'm definitely gonna hurry home.

1:09:05.008 --> 1:09:06.643
(quietly):
This bitch...

1:09:06.676 --> 1:09:08.445
-Okay, I love you.
-I love you, too.

1:09:08.478 --> 1:09:10.247
(phone beeps)

1:09:10.280 --> 1:09:13.250
* Back it up, back it up,
back it up *

1:09:13.283 --> 1:09:14.984
* I tell all my ... rake it up

1:09:15.018 --> 1:09:17.554
* Rake it, rake it,
break it down *

1:09:17.587 --> 1:09:19.223
* Back it up, back it up,
back it up *

1:09:19.256 --> 1:09:21.057
* Back it up, back it up,
back it up, back it up *

1:09:21.090 --> 1:09:22.426
* Rake it up, rake it up,
rake it up, back it up *

1:09:22.459 --> 1:09:23.793
* Back it up, back it up,
back it up *

1:09:23.827 --> 1:09:25.462
* Rake it up,
rake it up, rake it up *

1:09:25.495 --> 1:09:26.463
* I made love to a stripper...

1:09:26.496 --> 1:09:28.332
-Oh, I know who that is.
-Back up.

1:09:28.365 --> 1:09:30.267
(laughter)

1:09:30.300 --> 1:09:32.836
I'm white, not see-through.

1:09:32.869 --> 1:09:35.104
That's Noah Brooks.

1:09:35.138 --> 1:09:36.840
Yeah, his boy just pushed me.

1:09:36.873 --> 1:09:39.108
(both laugh)

1:09:39.142 --> 1:09:41.845
Look, this is about the only
club he can get it popping at

1:09:41.878 --> 1:09:44.681
after he got arrested.
Ignore them.

1:09:44.714 --> 1:09:47.116
-(both laugh) -Have you ever
heard his first album?

1:09:47.150 --> 1:09:50.320
My dad said it was like if
Maxwell and Marvin had a baby.

1:09:50.354 --> 1:09:51.355
DALLAS:
It was hot.

1:09:51.388 --> 1:09:52.789
It had five hits out the gate.

1:09:52.822 --> 1:09:54.791
Did he produce that, too?

1:09:54.824 --> 1:09:57.527
Yep.

1:09:57.561 --> 1:09:59.529
You got that song
we've been working on?

1:09:59.563 --> 1:10:02.232
-Yes, why?
-I'm-a play it for him.

1:10:02.266 --> 1:10:04.468
We're standing five feet away
from a hit maker

1:10:04.501 --> 1:10:05.902
-when we need a hit.
-Hmm.

1:10:05.935 --> 1:10:07.704
Watch this.

1:10:07.737 --> 1:10:09.273
-* Back it up, back it up
-(grunts)

1:10:09.306 --> 1:10:12.876
-(laughter)
-Don't embarrass me!

1:10:12.909 --> 1:10:14.143
I'm babysitting.
That's what I do.

1:10:14.177 --> 1:10:15.479
I babysit bitches-- okay.

1:10:15.512 --> 1:10:16.413
-COTTON: Welcome home.
-(laughs)

1:10:22.386 --> 1:10:23.687
I got to get a job
and pay my mama back.

1:10:23.720 --> 1:10:25.689
My manager is hiring
at the bank.

1:10:25.722 --> 1:10:28.658
Hey, Dallas, I just got arrested
for passing bad checks.

1:10:28.692 --> 1:10:30.460
You think they gonna hire me?

1:10:30.494 --> 1:10:33.597
Ladies, what y'all drinking on?

1:10:37.767 --> 1:10:39.736
Come on, man, you too sexy. You
need to come with me and slide

1:10:39.769 --> 1:10:41.871
through the city or something.

1:10:41.905 --> 1:10:44.674
* You can't ... with me
if you wanted to *

1:10:44.708 --> 1:10:46.510
* These expensive

1:10:46.543 --> 1:10:47.511
* These is red bottoms,
these is bloody shoes... *

1:10:47.544 --> 1:10:49.045
How you doing?

1:10:49.078 --> 1:10:50.680
Loved your first album.

1:10:50.714 --> 1:10:51.915
Even loved your second album.

1:10:51.948 --> 1:10:53.917
My name is Star.

1:10:53.950 --> 1:10:56.185
Noah.

1:10:56.219 --> 1:10:59.155
Excuse me, baby, could you move?

1:10:59.188 --> 1:11:01.257
We're trying to do business.

1:11:01.291 --> 1:11:04.260
* Say I don't got to dance,
I make money move *

1:11:04.294 --> 1:11:05.228
* If I see you
and I don't speak... *

1:11:05.261 --> 1:11:07.431
Anyway, this is, um...

1:11:07.464 --> 1:11:09.232
Wait. Ain't you
somebody's daughter?

1:11:09.265 --> 1:11:11.735
Yes, I'm somebody's daughter.

1:11:11.768 --> 1:11:13.202
What's the occasion?

1:11:13.236 --> 1:11:14.604
Figured in exchange
for that bottle,

1:11:14.638 --> 1:11:16.072
you could listen
to one of our songs?

1:11:16.105 --> 1:11:17.607
Tell us what you think
is missing.

1:11:17.641 --> 1:11:19.008
Baby, if you wanted
to go home with me,

1:11:19.042 --> 1:11:20.777
all you got to do is ask.
It's simple.

1:11:20.810 --> 1:11:22.612
I'd focus on your next hit,

1:11:22.646 --> 1:11:24.348
not your next piece
of ass, Noah.

1:11:24.381 --> 1:11:26.049
There's room for three.

1:11:26.082 --> 1:11:27.784
Now, come on, baby,
i-it's all good.

1:11:27.817 --> 1:11:29.619
Dude, nobody's trying
to go home with you.

1:11:29.653 --> 1:11:31.187
We just said that.

1:11:31.220 --> 1:11:33.056
-(Noah sighs)
-Are we?

1:11:33.089 --> 1:11:35.224
* What ... working
as hard as me? *

1:11:35.258 --> 1:11:36.526
Look, we're just trying
to give your played-out ass

1:11:36.560 --> 1:11:38.061
some juice, honestly.

1:11:38.094 --> 1:11:41.230
We are in the hottest girl group
coming up right now.

1:11:41.264 --> 1:11:42.799
You're a good R&B singer,

1:11:42.832 --> 1:11:44.801
but when's the last time
you put out an album?

1:11:44.834 --> 1:11:47.471
Look, nobody's checking
for you right now.

1:11:47.504 --> 1:11:49.839
But if you produced a song on
our album and it became a hit,

1:11:49.873 --> 1:11:53.242
well, maybe your fans would
wonder what you were up to.

1:11:53.276 --> 1:11:56.513
But I guess you got
everything you need in the VIP.

1:11:56.546 --> 1:11:58.348
So I'll just take that.

1:11:58.382 --> 1:11:59.616
(Noah scoffs)

1:11:59.649 --> 1:12:00.950
Have a good one.

1:12:00.984 --> 1:12:03.252
Wait, you gon--
you gonna take the bottle?

1:12:03.286 --> 1:12:05.622
Oh, this wasn't a gift, love.

1:12:05.655 --> 1:12:07.624
This was an exchange,
and you gave me nothing.

1:12:07.657 --> 1:12:10.727
(laughs)

1:12:10.760 --> 1:12:12.962
Well, that was a time suck.

1:12:12.996 --> 1:12:14.431
Now what?

1:12:14.464 --> 1:12:16.099
I don't know.

1:12:16.132 --> 1:12:17.667
You're the one
with all the thirsty ideas.

1:12:17.701 --> 1:12:19.235
Why don't you tell me?

1:12:19.268 --> 1:12:21.137
You're the one
who got into Juilliard.

1:12:21.170 --> 1:12:23.139
-Why don't you figure it out?
-Okay, well, first we have...

1:12:23.172 --> 1:12:24.374
MAN: Come on, now, you ain't
got to be all like that, mamas.

1:12:24.408 --> 1:12:26.142
Uh-oh.

1:12:26.175 --> 1:12:27.511
What, you think you too pretty
for me or something?

1:12:27.544 --> 1:12:28.878
We ain't interested.

1:12:28.912 --> 1:12:30.179
What?

1:12:30.213 --> 1:12:31.448
Bitch, you ain't all that.

1:12:31.481 --> 1:12:33.650
Y'all ain't doing nothing.

1:12:33.683 --> 1:12:35.419
Looking like old fake-ass
Blac Chyna, bitch.

1:12:35.452 --> 1:12:37.454
First of all...

1:12:37.487 --> 1:12:40.323
Cott, Cott, Cott, Cott, Cott.
Look, you're on parole, okay?

1:12:40.356 --> 1:12:42.492
She's right. I got this.

1:12:42.526 --> 1:12:45.028
* I make bloody moves...

1:12:45.061 --> 1:12:47.397
(low voice):
I will beat your ass

1:12:47.431 --> 1:12:49.198
-if you put your hands on her,
bitch. -(laughter)

1:12:49.232 --> 1:12:51.635
And that's on the real.

1:12:51.668 --> 1:12:54.438
You don't want these problems.

1:12:54.471 --> 1:12:57.441
* I'm rich, I'm rich,
I put my hand above my hip... *

1:12:57.474 --> 1:12:59.543
STAR:
Oh! (whoops)

1:12:59.576 --> 1:13:02.211
-Look. -STAR:
His face, he was so shook.

1:13:02.245 --> 1:13:05.381
That bullying stuff is
on some next-level ish now.

1:13:05.415 --> 1:13:07.484
I don't like that.
But you know what?

1:13:07.517 --> 1:13:09.619
I preach the word of whoop ass.

1:13:09.653 --> 1:13:11.120
Can the church get an "amen"?

1:13:11.154 --> 1:13:13.022
-ALEXANDRA: Amen.
-Amen. -Amen.

1:13:13.056 --> 1:13:15.559
(laughter)

1:13:15.592 --> 1:13:17.393
(beat playing)

1:13:17.427 --> 1:13:19.395
Wait.

1:13:19.429 --> 1:13:21.364
Star, listen, you hear that?

1:13:21.397 --> 1:13:22.566
Oh, what, the beat?

1:13:22.599 --> 1:13:24.133
Yeah.

1:13:24.167 --> 1:13:27.136
Think I got an idea.

1:13:27.170 --> 1:13:28.371
-(beat playing)
-(FaceTime ringing)

1:13:28.404 --> 1:13:30.707
-Simone?
-SIMONE: Hey, yeah.

1:13:30.740 --> 1:13:32.241
STAR:
Can you hear this song?

1:13:32.275 --> 1:13:34.343
Yeah, it's so dope.

1:13:34.377 --> 1:13:35.879
Your part is really sick.

1:13:35.912 --> 1:13:37.781
ALEXANDRA: I have it all
written out in my head.

1:13:37.814 --> 1:13:39.949
I promise you,
it'll be fire, okay?

1:13:39.983 --> 1:13:41.284
SIMONE:
Okay.

1:13:41.317 --> 1:13:43.019
STAR: Oh, you missed one
tonight, Simone.

1:13:43.052 --> 1:13:44.721
I really wish you were there.

1:13:44.754 --> 1:13:46.890
Dallas pulled this man voice
on this dude

1:13:46.923 --> 1:13:49.926
and shook him to his core,
it was hilarious.

1:13:49.959 --> 1:13:51.528
Out of nowhere, she goes,

1:13:51.561 --> 1:13:52.929
(low voice):
"Bitch, I will whoop

1:13:52.962 --> 1:13:54.931
-your ass..."
-(both laugh)

1:13:54.964 --> 1:13:57.000
-He ran, both feet.
-ALEXANDRA: He shut up so quick.

1:13:57.033 --> 1:13:59.569
I know we're being too loud,
but I'm-a come get you early.

1:13:59.603 --> 1:14:01.404
Okay.

1:14:01.437 --> 1:14:03.339
-Night.
-SIMONE: Star.

1:14:03.372 --> 1:14:05.441
Please get me out of here.

1:14:06.976 --> 1:14:08.344
(phone beeping)

1:14:16.319 --> 1:14:18.988
We know who you is.

1:14:21.558 --> 1:14:24.127
-I like your shoes, baby.
-Come up off 'em.

1:14:24.160 --> 1:14:25.929
I ain't giving y'all nothing.

1:14:25.962 --> 1:14:27.531
-DEE: Yes, you is.
-(pocket knife clicks)

1:14:27.564 --> 1:14:29.465
Don't you want to be
like Zendaya?

1:14:34.971 --> 1:14:35.872
(shoe clatters)

1:14:44.080 --> 1:14:45.014
(door closes)

1:14:47.316 --> 1:14:49.152
(sniffles)

1:14:55.291 --> 1:14:56.526
* Only rock with bad bitches,
bad bitches in my circle... *

1:14:56.560 --> 1:14:58.094
What?

1:14:58.127 --> 1:14:59.763
(laughing):
I'm just playing.

1:14:59.796 --> 1:15:02.131
Don't do that.
Give me my headphones.

1:15:02.165 --> 1:15:03.399
It sounds perfect.

1:15:03.432 --> 1:15:06.002
It sounds good.

1:15:06.035 --> 1:15:07.804
Look, I know we're tired.

1:15:07.837 --> 1:15:10.774
And I know you have a lot going
on, especially, but...

1:15:10.807 --> 1:15:12.809
we got to get this right.

1:15:12.842 --> 1:15:14.844
I know you probably don't
want to talk about it,

1:15:14.878 --> 1:15:18.247
or you don't want to talk to me,
I don't know what it is,

1:15:18.281 --> 1:15:21.718
but... are you
at least talking to Derek?

1:15:21.751 --> 1:15:24.087
I'm not putting anything else
on his plate.

1:15:24.120 --> 1:15:26.623
Alex, that's not putting
something on his plate.

1:15:26.656 --> 1:15:28.391
Y'all went through
a miscarriage together.

1:15:29.826 --> 1:15:32.428
That's his life, too.

1:15:32.461 --> 1:15:34.463
Yo, you have to talk
to him about it.

1:15:34.497 --> 1:15:38.301
-Okay.
-Okay.

1:15:38.334 --> 1:15:40.169
And then let's get this money.

1:15:40.203 --> 1:15:41.437
I'm gonna go get Simone.

1:15:41.470 --> 1:15:43.006
I already got her.

1:15:43.039 --> 1:15:45.041
Come on, Simone, learn the song.

1:15:45.074 --> 1:15:47.644
Alex, you been here all night,
go check on your man.

1:15:47.677 --> 1:15:49.112
Star, I need you to go
downstairs and refill

1:15:49.145 --> 1:15:51.480
all those conditioner bottles
at every station.

1:15:51.514 --> 1:15:52.649
Why do I have to work
in the salon?

1:15:52.682 --> 1:15:54.217
'Cause I said so.

1:15:54.250 --> 1:15:55.418
I'm-a get Holland on the line.

1:15:55.451 --> 1:15:56.986
Come on, let's get it.

1:15:57.020 --> 1:15:58.855
STAR:
I swear, she does it on purpose.

1:15:58.888 --> 1:16:01.190
You ready?

1:16:01.224 --> 1:16:03.192
Something has to happen.

1:16:03.226 --> 1:16:04.994
I can't live like this anymore.

1:16:05.028 --> 1:16:06.963
CARLOTTA:
No, no.

1:16:06.996 --> 1:16:09.132
Mr. Holland said he wanted
to see us before the meeting.

1:16:09.165 --> 1:16:10.566
So just tell him we'll be there.

1:16:10.600 --> 1:16:12.535
Thanks.

1:16:14.237 --> 1:16:16.205
(groans)

1:16:16.239 --> 1:16:19.408
What's the matter?

1:16:19.442 --> 1:16:22.045
I was gonna sell his car,

1:16:22.078 --> 1:16:24.180
but then this fell
out the visor.

1:16:29.452 --> 1:16:31.855
I gave it to him.

1:16:31.888 --> 1:16:33.422
He wanted it.

1:16:33.456 --> 1:16:36.793
You miss him?

1:16:36.826 --> 1:16:40.263
Let's not talk about that
right now, Cotton.

1:16:40.296 --> 1:16:41.931
Now why are you trying
to sell his car?

1:16:41.965 --> 1:16:44.467
Because you mortgaged
the salon for me, Ma.

1:16:44.500 --> 1:16:46.102
Who told you that mess? Bruce?

1:16:46.135 --> 1:16:48.972
You and Grandma worked so hard
for the salon.

1:16:49.005 --> 1:16:51.307
And I wanted that surgery
so bad, I stole from Elliot,

1:16:51.340 --> 1:16:52.776
and for what?

1:16:52.809 --> 1:16:55.044
Look, look, I know
you're gonna pay me back

1:16:55.078 --> 1:16:57.914
'cause you're a hustler
just like your daddy.

1:16:57.947 --> 1:17:01.417
No. I get that hustle
from you, Ma.

1:17:04.553 --> 1:17:08.057
Hey. We got that song.

1:17:08.091 --> 1:17:10.059
Don't you want it?

1:17:10.093 --> 1:17:12.628
This is not the time, ladies.

1:17:12.662 --> 1:17:15.799
Look, you know I'm not
taking no for an answer.

1:17:15.832 --> 1:17:17.066
Right?

1:17:17.100 --> 1:17:19.068
SIMONE:
Alex, play the track.

1:17:19.102 --> 1:17:23.406
* When I walked in,
everybody mumblin' who dis? *

1:17:23.439 --> 1:17:24.808
* Well, if you ain't know

1:17:24.841 --> 1:17:28.611
* Must be dumb or blind
or stupid *

1:17:28.644 --> 1:17:32.381
* My pedigree too strong,
a line of bad bitches *

1:17:32.415 --> 1:17:37.553
* My grandma and my mama,
check my lineage *

1:17:37.586 --> 1:17:39.222
* Ah, ah, ah

1:17:39.255 --> 1:17:41.124
* Yep, it's all up in my blood

1:17:41.157 --> 1:17:43.226
* Ah, ah, ah

1:17:43.259 --> 1:17:45.929
* These haters
be showing me love *

1:17:45.962 --> 1:17:48.331
* No, whether
you classy or ratchet *

1:17:48.364 --> 1:17:49.498
* As ratchet as ratchet as

1:17:49.532 --> 1:17:51.835
* Go on and throw
them hands up *

1:17:51.868 --> 1:17:53.436
* If can't nobody
tell you nothing *

1:17:53.469 --> 1:17:55.671
* If you know like I know

1:17:55.705 --> 1:17:58.274
* Then they don't make them
nothin' like yo, yo, yo *

1:17:58.307 --> 1:18:01.610
* Got your own car, own money,
'bout to get a degree, too *

You wanted
an international sound?

1:19:13.016 --> 1:19:14.717
We delivered.

1:19:14.750 --> 1:19:16.352
That's exactly
what I was looking for

1:19:16.385 --> 1:19:17.887
five months ago
when I signed you.

1:19:17.921 --> 1:19:19.188
STAR:
Five months ago?

1:19:19.222 --> 1:19:21.557
'Cause you asked for it
last night.

1:19:21.590 --> 1:19:23.492
Well, we got a lot more
where that came from.

1:19:23.526 --> 1:19:25.628
Well, it don't matter.

1:19:25.661 --> 1:19:27.931
I just went up in that
board meeting and got fired.

1:19:27.964 --> 1:19:30.133
Yeah, they got a new head
coming in.

1:19:30.166 --> 1:19:31.367
Makes sense.

1:19:32.735 --> 1:19:34.203
Who is it?

1:19:34.237 --> 1:19:35.972
You ever heard
of the Floyd family?

1:19:36.005 --> 1:19:37.573
CARLOTTA:
Yeah, who hasn't?

1:19:37.606 --> 1:19:39.208
Wait, Charles Floyd
bought this label?

1:19:39.242 --> 1:19:41.444
No, his daughter did.

1:19:42.912 --> 1:19:44.247
And she's a bad bitch.

1:19:45.982 --> 1:19:47.483
Good luck, ladies.

1:19:51.220 --> 1:19:54.590
Alex, please tell me
you know this woman.

1:19:54.623 --> 1:19:55.892
Yeah, I do.

1:19:55.925 --> 1:19:57.493
She's trouble.

1:20:04.467 --> 1:20:05.869
Ayanna Floyd.

1:20:05.902 --> 1:20:07.603
Well, when is she leaving
New York?

1:20:07.636 --> 1:20:10.773
No, I don't want to be...
don't put me on...

1:20:10.806 --> 1:20:14.277
hold.

1:20:14.310 --> 1:20:16.512
Come on, girl, I got to get
you back on time.

1:20:16.545 --> 1:20:18.814
(groans) I don't want to go back
to that place.

1:20:18.848 --> 1:20:20.984
-I know, baby. -I don't even
know what's going on.

1:20:21.017 --> 1:20:22.818
It's like we're cursed
or something.

1:20:22.852 --> 1:20:25.254
Star is still upset over Hunter,
Alex lost a baby,

1:20:25.288 --> 1:20:26.455
and I'm stuck in that
freakin' hellhole.

1:20:26.489 --> 1:20:28.191
And all we want to do is sing.

1:20:28.224 --> 1:20:30.459
Well, I'm not gonna let
this label president

1:20:30.493 --> 1:20:31.895
stop you from doing that,
either.

1:20:31.928 --> 1:20:34.030
-I'm-a fix this.
-How?

1:20:34.063 --> 1:20:36.165
I'm going back to New York.

1:20:36.199 --> 1:20:38.134
The Lyons owe me.

1:20:38.167 --> 1:20:39.468
That's not a bad thing.

1:20:39.502 --> 1:20:41.204
(laughs)
No, it definitely ain't.

1:20:41.237 --> 1:20:42.538
(laughing):
Yeah.

1:20:42.571 --> 1:20:43.839
My wig straight?

1:20:43.873 --> 1:20:45.108
Straight as those people
downstairs.

1:20:45.141 --> 1:20:47.443
(Carlotta laughs)

1:20:47.476 --> 1:20:50.379
*

1:20:56.319 --> 1:20:57.620
You know the drill.

1:20:57.653 --> 1:20:58.922
No touching,

1:20:58.955 --> 1:21:00.489
they can only put money
in the G-string,

1:21:00.523 --> 1:21:02.491
and no pictures.

1:21:02.525 --> 1:21:05.361
But when I called earlier, you
said that someone requested me.

1:21:05.394 --> 1:21:07.530
-He's in there. Hit it.
-(smacks)

1:21:16.872 --> 1:21:17.873
Hi, baby.

1:21:21.244 --> 1:21:22.878
I heard you were home.

1:21:30.219 --> 1:21:33.522
How are you? Okay?

1:21:33.556 --> 1:21:36.159
You know, all we talk about
is me.

1:21:36.192 --> 1:21:38.594
I want to talk to you, too.

1:21:41.897 --> 1:21:44.833
It's like...

1:21:44.867 --> 1:21:47.570
ever since the miscarriage,
you don't want...

1:21:47.603 --> 1:21:50.206
We don't have
to talk about that.

1:21:50.239 --> 1:21:52.041
All right.

1:22:07.623 --> 1:22:09.858
Stop.

1:22:12.228 --> 1:22:13.629
Okay.

1:22:19.335 --> 1:22:21.404
It's okay.

1:22:21.437 --> 1:22:22.638
We're good.

1:22:31.981 --> 1:22:33.949
ALEXANDRA: I can't believe
I'm having an abortion.

1:22:36.452 --> 1:22:38.021
ANESTHESIOLOGIST:

1:22:48.998 --> 1:22:52.968
three... two...

1:22:53.002 --> 1:22:56.572
one.

1:22:56.605 --> 1:22:58.274
ARLENE: I'm gonna tell you
the truth right now.

1:22:58.307 --> 1:23:02.645
When you lose a son,
you need to think positive.

1:23:02.678 --> 1:23:06.049
Excuse me. Excuse me, I'm sorry.

1:23:06.082 --> 1:23:07.450
Do you have any questions?

1:23:07.483 --> 1:23:08.984
PHOTOGRAPHER: That's perfect,
just hold that-- hold it.

1:23:09.018 --> 1:23:10.819
Look out for Big Trouble
this fall.

1:23:10.853 --> 1:23:12.755
Thank you.

1:23:12.788 --> 1:23:17.026
Trying to do something
that will lift people's spirits.

1:23:17.060 --> 1:23:19.495
That's the kind of person I am.
That's what this foundation...

1:23:19.528 --> 1:23:21.497
PHOTOGRAPHER 2: Can I get one
of the two of you together?

1:23:24.833 --> 1:23:26.335
-How are you? -PHOTOGRAPHER 3:
Beautiful, Star.

1:23:26.369 --> 1:23:28.304
-One more, please.
-Excuse me, Melanie.

1:23:28.337 --> 1:23:30.773
-One moment.
-Excuse us, Melanie.

1:23:30.806 --> 1:23:34.310
ARLENE (quietly): You little
bitch, what are you doing here?

1:23:34.343 --> 1:23:36.245
Oh, keep it together, Arlene.

1:23:36.279 --> 1:23:38.047
There are photographers
everywhere.

1:23:38.081 --> 1:23:39.448
Just keep a smile on your face.

1:23:42.051 --> 1:23:45.921
You and I both know
you raised a monster, Arlene.

1:23:45.954 --> 1:23:48.991
-And I've got the pictures
to prove it. -Yeah?

1:23:49.024 --> 1:23:51.094
-Stop digging into my past...
-Hmm.

1:23:51.127 --> 1:23:52.861
-...and I won't dig up yours.
-Well...

1:23:52.895 --> 1:23:54.363
-Understood?
-Sure.

1:23:56.732 --> 1:23:58.934
(whispering):
I found your juvie records.

1:23:58.967 --> 1:24:01.937
You're a murderer
and you murdered my son.

1:24:05.040 --> 1:24:08.544
I truly wish that I had.

1:24:08.577 --> 1:24:11.013
PHOTOGRAPHER 1: Great shot.
Smile, Ms. Davis.

1:24:11.046 --> 1:24:13.549
Hello. How are you?

1:24:13.582 --> 1:24:16.018
Everybody look for Big Trouble's
debut album.

1:24:16.051 --> 1:24:17.120
It's coming soon.

1:24:17.153 --> 1:24:18.454
Thank you so much.

1:24:18.487 --> 1:24:19.422
PHOTOGRAPHER 3:
One more, please.

1:24:21.690 --> 1:24:23.326
Why you got my ass here anyway,
boy?

1:24:23.359 --> 1:24:25.961
Aunt Carol,
just shut up and chill, okay?

1:24:25.994 --> 1:24:27.130
And just remember
that she don't know nothing

1:24:27.163 --> 1:24:28.097
about Dad's memory loss.

1:24:28.131 --> 1:24:29.698
Uh, Miss Brown?

1:24:29.732 --> 1:24:32.501
Carlotta.

1:24:32.535 --> 1:24:35.904
-Mally Mal, you're doing good,
boy. -(Jamal chuckles)

1:24:35.938 --> 1:24:38.141
I used to take care of you
when you was a baby.

1:24:38.174 --> 1:24:39.475
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

1:24:39.508 --> 1:24:42.211
Carol.

1:24:42.245 --> 1:24:44.547
But I wasn't expecting
to see y'all.

1:24:44.580 --> 1:24:46.349
I was actually expecting
to see your father here.

1:24:46.382 --> 1:24:47.883
M-My dad couldn't make it.

1:24:47.916 --> 1:24:50.085
'Cause something's
wrong with him.

1:24:50.119 --> 1:24:51.854
*

1:24:51.887 --> 1:24:55.124
'Cause he got busy.

1:24:55.158 --> 1:24:57.360
Anyway, my mom,
she insisted that I come.

1:24:57.393 --> 1:24:58.961
Said it was a priority that
I help an old family friend.

1:25:00.863 --> 1:25:03.699
Miss Carlotta,
what you got on my parents?

1:25:03.732 --> 1:25:05.934
They're not just gonna jump
for anybody.

1:25:05.968 --> 1:25:08.103
We ain't got the time.

1:25:08.137 --> 1:25:11.207
Well, look, it's still probably
the best thing that I came.

1:25:11.240 --> 1:25:13.342
Yeah, she probably gonna want
to see your fine ass, anyway.

1:25:13.376 --> 1:25:14.777
(Jamal laughs)

1:25:14.810 --> 1:25:17.012
I bet them dimples
get you in trouble.

1:25:17.045 --> 1:25:17.880
Me, I do all right.

1:25:17.913 --> 1:25:19.548
I bet you do.

1:25:19.582 --> 1:25:20.949
You just sit
your little ass here.

1:25:20.983 --> 1:25:22.785
Well, you just
hurry your ass up.

1:25:26.088 --> 1:25:29.292
Ayanna, what's good?

1:25:29.325 --> 1:25:32.094
I cleared the pool for you.

1:25:32.127 --> 1:25:34.930
Oh, so you fancier
than my mama now, huh?

1:25:34.963 --> 1:25:36.299
AYANNA:
Need to get you loosened up

1:25:36.332 --> 1:25:38.267
so we can talk about bringing
you over to my label.

1:25:38.301 --> 1:25:39.768
(Jamal chuckles)

1:25:39.802 --> 1:25:41.504
Well, first things first.

1:25:41.537 --> 1:25:43.105
Carlotta Brown,
meet Ayanna Floyd.

1:25:43.138 --> 1:25:44.173
Ayanna is the president
of y'all label.

1:25:44.207 --> 1:25:46.141
And Carlotta, she's, um...

1:25:46.175 --> 1:25:48.110
Mixed Harmony.

1:25:48.143 --> 1:25:49.312
I'm familiar.

1:25:49.345 --> 1:25:52.248
Well, actually,
I'm managing now

1:25:52.281 --> 1:25:53.882
and my girls are signed
to your label.

1:25:53.916 --> 1:25:56.919
I know that.

1:25:56.952 --> 1:25:58.254
And you came here
wanting to know

1:25:58.287 --> 1:25:59.755
what I have planned for them,

1:25:59.788 --> 1:26:01.924
and you thought ambushing me
with a Lyon

1:26:01.957 --> 1:26:03.492
would get my attention.

1:26:03.526 --> 1:26:06.262
I don't like being ambushed.

1:26:06.295 --> 1:26:08.364
(chuckles)
Why you being shady?

1:26:08.397 --> 1:26:11.467
-Come on, Ya-Ya.
-Shut up, Jamal.

1:26:11.500 --> 1:26:13.869
Well, my girls have been
working really hard

1:26:13.902 --> 1:26:15.204
since Atlanta NextFest.

1:26:15.238 --> 1:26:17.105
I just want to see...

1:26:17.139 --> 1:26:20.443
Set up an appointment
with my assistant.

1:26:20.476 --> 1:26:22.645
And Carlotta...

1:26:22.678 --> 1:26:24.680
don't try to play me again.

1:26:24.713 --> 1:26:27.616

1:26:27.650 --> 1:26:29.184
