WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.079
Previously on...

00:02.103 --> 00:04.760
George paid for what he did
to your father.

00:04.784 --> 00:06.053
Bree confessed...

00:06.077 --> 00:08.615
Did you give Zach money
to go to Utah?

00:08.639 --> 00:12.119
Susan betrayed Mike...
What kind of friend is he?

00:12.143 --> 00:14.596
The real good kind.
Andrew pushed the boundaries...

00:14.620 --> 00:16.993
Zach's come home.
Is there anything I can do?

00:17.017 --> 00:19.466
Paul put his foot down...
You can leave us alone.

00:19.490 --> 00:21.198
So when do I tell people
you'll be back?

00:21.222 --> 00:22.669
Couple, maybe three days.

00:22.693 --> 00:28.303
And a stranger
finally caught up with Caleb.

00:30.561 --> 00:32.539
Kisses are such simple things,

00:32.563 --> 00:35.112
we hardly notice them.

00:35.136 --> 00:37.384
But if we paid more attention,

00:37.408 --> 00:41.318
we'd see that each kiss
conveys a meaning all its own.

00:41.342 --> 00:47.194
For example, some can say,
"I'm so happy to see you."

00:47.218 --> 00:51.798
Or, "I didn't realize
you'dbe here."

00:51.822 --> 00:53.230
Bye.

00:53.254 --> 00:57.734
Or, "honey,
it's time to stop drinking."

00:57.758 --> 01:01.568
The trick is in knowing
how to tell the difference.

01:01.592 --> 01:05.072
So I finally said,
if I'm head cheerleader,

01:05.096 --> 01:07.214
then nobody wears panties.

01:07.238 --> 01:08.238
Yeah!

01:10.101 --> 01:12.079
I just want you to know
as a former member

01:12.103 --> 01:14.626
of my high school marching band,
I would've appreciated that.

01:14.650 --> 01:18.225
Wait a second, you were a band
geek? Oh, I don't believe it.

01:18.249 --> 01:21.358
What did you play? He
played the tuba. I have pictures.

01:21.382 --> 01:23.360
The tuba, huh?

01:23.384 --> 01:25.371
Yeah, go ahead, come on, come
on, get your licks in, go ahead.

01:25.395 --> 01:27.364
No, no, not at all.
As a matter of fact,

01:27.388 --> 01:29.666
all of my secret crushes
were on the band geeks.

01:29.690 --> 01:31.198
Come on,
I know you cheerleader types.

01:31.222 --> 01:32.799
You wouldn't have said "boo"
to guys like me.

01:32.823 --> 01:35.250
No, you were more interested
in the guys like... like this.

01:35.274 --> 01:38.305
Now, I take it
you didn't play the tuba.

01:38.329 --> 01:40.777
No, I didn't.

01:40.801 --> 01:44.651
All I know is, I was a lonely,
insecure tuba player.

01:44.675 --> 01:47.114
Girls like Gabrielle would just
rip my heart out.

01:47.138 --> 01:48.285
Aw.

01:48.309 --> 01:50.187
I didn't even had my first kiss
until I was 18.

01:50.211 --> 01:52.289
18? Pathetic, I know.

01:52.313 --> 01:54.291
Poor baby.
I would've kissed you.

01:54.315 --> 01:55.822
No, you wouldn't have.
Yes, I would have.

01:55.846 --> 01:59.266
No, you wouldn't have.
And it's okay, Gaby.

01:59.290 --> 02:00.527
Those scars healed
a long time ago.

02:00.551 --> 02:03.270
Oh, for god sakes, come here.

02:03.294 --> 02:06.141
Now on behalf of all
the cheerleaders in the world,

02:06.165 --> 02:07.674
forgive us.

02:07.698 --> 02:11.138
Oh, yeah! Whoo!

02:11.162 --> 02:17.784
Yes, kisses mean different
things to different people.

02:17.808 --> 02:19.286
Ultimately, the meaning depends

02:19.310 --> 02:21.288
on the one who does
the kissing...

02:21.312 --> 02:23.420
Wowie.

02:23.444 --> 02:26.393
Cheers.

02:26.417 --> 02:34.417
And the who sees it happen.

02:41.492 --> 02:45.842
After every party
comes the time for cleaning.

02:45.866 --> 02:48.845
We attend to the champagne
that was spilled,

02:48.869 --> 02:53.220
the knickknacks that got broken,

02:53.244 --> 02:58.655
the food that went uneaten.

02:58.679 --> 03:01.228
Oh, here, let me take that.

03:01.252 --> 03:05.192
And whatever other messes
need cleaning up.

03:05.216 --> 03:08.535
So, uh, Gaby...

03:08.559 --> 03:11.298
You know that thing
you and Tom did tonight?

03:11.322 --> 03:12.439
The... the kiss?

03:12.463 --> 03:15.442
Was that hysterical?
The look on Tom's face!

03:15.466 --> 03:17.966
Yeah.

03:24.535 --> 03:29.856
I know this sounds silly, but...

03:29.880 --> 03:31.918
It kind of bugged me.

03:31.942 --> 03:34.261
You're not serious.

03:34.285 --> 03:35.762
Yeah, I am.

03:35.786 --> 03:38.295
I don't... I don't want to make

03:38.319 --> 03:39.796
a big deal out of it, but, uh,

03:39.820 --> 03:43.970
could you maybe
not do that again?

03:43.994 --> 03:46.433
Okay.

03:46.457 --> 03:48.605
Thanks.

03:48.629 --> 03:50.607
Okay.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.609
Hey, what happened to
the applewhites?

03:52.633 --> 03:54.750
I thought you were
gonna invite them.

03:54.774 --> 03:57.244
I did. Betty never r.S.V.P.'D.

03:57.268 --> 03:58.645
What do you guys think
about the applewhites?

03:58.669 --> 04:00.647
I like 'em, very nice. Very...

04:00.671 --> 04:01.948
Interesting.

04:01.972 --> 04:03.720
Right, interesting.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.357
Hmm, they weird me out, too.

04:05.381 --> 04:07.324
Well, that's not
what we're saying.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.496
Not exactly, anyway.

04:09.520 --> 04:11.828
You know,
we were just having fun,

04:11.852 --> 04:13.360
entertaining the crowd.

04:13.384 --> 04:14.801
Oh, sure, but...

04:14.825 --> 04:18.233
But maybe next time
you could try juggling instead.

04:18.257 --> 04:19.988
What's going on? Nothing.

04:22.363 --> 04:25.372
Really?
I sense a little tension.

04:25.396 --> 04:26.636
No, no tension.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.379
What?

04:32.403 --> 04:33.850
You make it sound like...

04:33.874 --> 04:35.331
I was making a pass
at your husband.

04:35.355 --> 04:38.325
And that's just
a little bit insulting.

04:38.349 --> 04:42.028
I just said it bugged me.

04:42.052 --> 04:43.330
Why is that a problem?

04:43.354 --> 04:45.701
Is this about that kiss?
What kiss?

04:45.725 --> 04:47.994
Oh, you were in the living room.

04:48.018 --> 04:50.837
Gaby planted a big, wet kiss
on Tom... as a joke.

04:50.861 --> 04:51.838
It was hilarious.

04:51.862 --> 04:53.500
You see?

04:53.524 --> 04:56.277
Yeah, but to be fair
to Lynette, you are an ex-model.

04:56.301 --> 04:58.975
And surely it must have
dawned on you that some women

04:58.999 --> 05:02.609
might prefer it if you didn't kiss
their husbands. That's all I'm saying.

05:02.633 --> 05:04.911
Oh, you guys, we're all friends.

05:04.935 --> 05:06.983
This isn't something
to get worked up over.

05:07.007 --> 05:08.655
I'm not worked up.

05:08.679 --> 05:10.439
Me neither.

05:12.383 --> 05:15.370
Hey, everyone, did you see what
Kathy Lewis was wearing tonight?

05:15.394 --> 05:18.465
And whoever told her
that she could get away

05:18.489 --> 05:20.527
with those vertical stripes
should be shot.

05:20.551 --> 05:22.451
Oh. Bye, sweetie.

05:37.067 --> 05:39.045
Uh...

05:39.069 --> 05:41.439
Oh!

05:49.480 --> 05:51.458
Zach is back!

05:51.482 --> 05:53.460
Yeah, yeah, I know.

05:53.484 --> 05:55.031
You do?

05:55.055 --> 05:57.033
Yeah, he's been back
for a couple of days now.

05:57.057 --> 06:00.437
Well, that's great,
isn't it? Yeah.

06:00.461 --> 06:02.439
I thought
you'd be happy about it.

06:02.463 --> 06:04.480
I thought
that's what you wanted.

06:04.504 --> 06:05.972
I was hoping

06:05.996 --> 06:07.974
that I'd slowly establish
a relationship with Zach

06:07.998 --> 06:09.976
and then when we were
comfortable,

06:10.000 --> 06:11.918
I'd tell him I was his real dad.
But now Paul's back.

06:11.942 --> 06:13.620
And he doesn't want you
anywhere near him.

06:13.644 --> 06:15.627
He's threatened
to tell the police

06:15.651 --> 06:17.624
everything that happened
in the desert...

06:17.648 --> 06:19.786
That I held a gun to his head.

06:19.810 --> 06:21.788
Well, it's your word
against his.

06:21.812 --> 06:23.660
But he doesn't have
a record, and I do.

06:23.684 --> 06:28.134
You know, despite what I did...

06:28.158 --> 06:30.937
Sending Zach away,

06:30.961 --> 06:32.799
I want you two to connect.
I hope you know that.

06:32.823 --> 06:34.703
I do.

06:36.026 --> 06:38.805
And on the bright side,

06:38.829 --> 06:41.729
I don't have to wonder
where he is anymore.

06:46.577 --> 06:49.786
It says that you can do
a report on anything

06:49.810 --> 06:51.387
from the suggested reading list,
which includes

06:51.411 --> 06:54.461
"the old man and the sea,"
"the Pearl,"

06:54.485 --> 06:56.463
"much ado about nothing."

06:56.487 --> 06:59.095
Hmm. That sounds good.
What do you like?

06:59.119 --> 07:00.689
I don't care.

07:02.793 --> 07:04.676
Let's start with "the Pearl."

07:04.700 --> 07:07.525
It's got a sad ending, but it's
good. We'll start with that.

07:11.532 --> 07:14.511
You know,
it's not gonna be so bad.

07:14.535 --> 07:16.575
I think you're really gonna like
being homeschooled.

07:18.869 --> 07:23.550
Okay, I know this isn't
what you want.

07:23.574 --> 07:25.461
But I need to keep you
close to me

07:25.485 --> 07:26.693
just for a while.

07:26.717 --> 07:28.555
There are people
in this neighborhood

07:28.579 --> 07:30.597
who aren't thrilled
that we're back.

07:30.621 --> 07:33.700
People I don't trust.

07:33.724 --> 07:36.202
People like... Mike Delfino?

07:36.226 --> 07:38.705
Why would you say that?

07:38.729 --> 07:40.206
When you disappeared,

07:40.230 --> 07:43.910
Mrs. Tillman said that Mike
took you somewhere to kill you.

07:43.934 --> 07:47.614
That's ridiculous.
Why would Mike wanna kill me?

07:47.638 --> 07:49.598
Because you murdered Mrs. Huber?

07:51.642 --> 07:53.449
What did you say?

07:53.473 --> 07:55.560
Well, Mrs. Tillman said that
you murdered Mrs. Huber

07:55.584 --> 07:57.524
because she was
blackmailing mom.

07:57.548 --> 07:58.785
And you believed her?

07:58.809 --> 08:00.487
No, not exactly.

08:00.511 --> 08:02.859
I mean, why? Should I?

08:02.883 --> 08:08.194
Zach, you know me
better than anyone.

08:08.218 --> 08:10.867
Do you honestly believe

08:10.891 --> 08:12.839
that I am capable of murder?

08:12.863 --> 08:15.171
No.

08:15.195 --> 08:16.695
All right, then.

08:18.569 --> 08:21.508
Of course...

08:21.532 --> 08:25.112
I didn't think mom was capable
of suicide, either.

08:27.037 --> 08:28.515
On second thought,

08:28.539 --> 08:32.188
why don't we start with
"much ado about nothing"?

08:32.212 --> 08:36.491
I think we could use
a few laughs around here.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.625
Yeah, man...

08:38.649 --> 08:41.727
Yeah, he sure is. I just...

08:41.751 --> 08:44.152
Probably. Yeah.

08:56.106 --> 08:57.083
Hey.

08:57.107 --> 08:59.586
Get over here.

08:59.610 --> 09:02.248
Now.

09:02.272 --> 09:04.551
Somebody's angry.

09:04.575 --> 09:06.593
Did one of your soufflés fall?

09:06.617 --> 09:09.155
I saw what you did
with your friend.

09:09.179 --> 09:11.628
Oh, and you didn't turn into
a pillar of salt. Good for you.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.129
This is not a joke, Andrew.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.201
What if the neighbors
had seen you?

09:15.225 --> 09:16.963
Well, I'd hope they'd think
that I'd landed a hottie.

09:16.987 --> 09:18.965
I may not be able to control

09:18.989 --> 09:20.967
what you do outside
of this home,

09:20.991 --> 09:22.969
but while
you are under this roof,

09:22.993 --> 09:24.941
you will not mock my values.

09:24.965 --> 09:27.113
If you so much
as smile at that boy,

09:27.137 --> 09:29.646
so help me, I will ship you off
to camp hennessey

09:29.670 --> 09:31.648
and I will not pick you up
again until you are 18.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.672
Do I make myself clear?

09:37.978 --> 09:39.726
Aren't you forgetting something?

09:39.750 --> 09:42.010
I know you like to knock
a few back before bedtime.

09:43.754 --> 09:46.032
Go on, take it. It's okay.

09:46.056 --> 09:49.135
We both know
that of the two of us,

09:49.159 --> 09:50.959
I'm the one that doesn't judge.

10:07.607 --> 10:11.688
Please. I don't wanna
stay down here.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.920
I-I know.

10:13.944 --> 10:16.623
I'm sorry, k.

10:16.647 --> 10:17.817
I'm sorry.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.906
Matthew, I think we might
have termites.

10:24.930 --> 10:26.903
You need to take
a look at those steps

10:26.927 --> 10:29.605
before one of us
breaks our neck.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.138
What's the matter?
Is your brother okay?

10:32.162 --> 10:34.310
No, he's not.
He hates it down here.

10:34.334 --> 10:37.684
He wants to be with us.
You're being cruel.

10:37.708 --> 10:39.746
If you are so concerned
about him,

10:39.770 --> 10:42.318
you should spend less time
on your computer

10:42.342 --> 10:44.320
and more time down here
keeping him company.

10:44.344 --> 10:45.822
We're bringing him up,

10:45.846 --> 10:50.256
but not until I am sure
that it's safe.

10:50.280 --> 10:53.860
♪ there's been
a load of compromising ♪

10:53.884 --> 10:58.294

11:05.836 --> 11:06.813
Hey, you!

Yeah?

11:13.673 --> 11:15.752
What's the deal?

11:15.776 --> 11:17.724
You've been parked on our street
for two hours.

11:17.748 --> 11:19.986
Oh, I'm doing
a property appraisal.

11:20.010 --> 11:21.988
Some neighbors of yours
are thinking about moving.

11:22.012 --> 11:23.659
The applewhites?

11:23.683 --> 11:25.992
I'm not really allowed to say.

11:26.016 --> 11:29.696
I sold them that house.
You know, this is my turf!

11:29.720 --> 11:31.197
Who do you work for?

11:31.221 --> 11:32.438
Geist realty?

11:32.462 --> 11:34.670
Ah, westside properties.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.803
Yeah, well, whoever it is,
you go back

11:36.827 --> 11:38.805
and you tell your bosses
that nobody, and I mean, nobody,

11:38.829 --> 11:40.807
buys or sells properties
in this neighborhood

11:40.831 --> 11:43.149
without going through
Edie britt, you got that?

11:43.173 --> 11:45.852
Look, lady, I just go
where I'm told.

11:45.876 --> 11:47.854
You look, you cross me,

11:47.878 --> 11:52.859
and I will be
your worst nightmare.

11:52.883 --> 11:55.723
I'm a dangerous woman.
You don't wanna mess with me.

11:57.818 --> 11:59.288
You got it.

12:12.362 --> 12:13.780
Ms. Mayer?

12:13.804 --> 12:15.782
Zach. May I talk to you?

12:15.806 --> 12:17.413
I have some things
that I need to say.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.245
Okay.

12:19.269 --> 12:22.088
I-I know that I did
a lot of bad stuff...

12:22.112 --> 12:24.826
Stuff that I'm not gonna
be able to take back.

12:24.850 --> 12:26.753
Ms. Mayer,
I'm... I'm really sorry.

12:26.777 --> 12:28.755
But when I was living
on the streets, you know,

12:28.779 --> 12:31.758
I had a lot of time to...
To just sit and think to myself

12:31.782 --> 12:33.499
and clear my head and...

12:33.523 --> 12:36.037
I've grown up, you know?
I don't want you to worry.

12:36.061 --> 12:38.464
I'm not gonna be
bothering you anymore.

12:38.488 --> 12:40.888
Either of you.

12:42.993 --> 12:46.242
Well, thanks.
We appreciate that.

12:46.266 --> 12:50.877
Please don't tell my dad
that I talked to you.

12:50.901 --> 12:53.019
He's just... he's been really...

12:53.043 --> 12:54.913
Intense lately.

13:00.450 --> 13:02.428
Well, what do you think?

13:02.452 --> 13:04.430
He seems different.

13:04.454 --> 13:06.432
I believe him.

13:06.456 --> 13:08.434
Yeah, I can't believe
I'm about to say this,

13:08.458 --> 13:10.466
but I feel sorry for him.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.468
It's like he's so fragile.

13:12.492 --> 13:15.902
I know, and he's locked in that
house with Mr. Creepy 24/7.

13:15.926 --> 13:17.773
Did you know that he's
homeschooling Zach now?

13:17.797 --> 13:20.346
I think he should
spend some time

13:20.370 --> 13:22.870
with a decent role model,
don't you?

13:29.279 --> 13:31.017
Hi!

13:31.041 --> 13:32.188
Hey, you're out early.

13:32.212 --> 13:34.190
Oh, I just wanted to pick up

13:34.214 --> 13:36.823
some fresh croissants
for breakfast.

13:36.847 --> 13:39.225
Oh, cool. Listen,
I just wanted you to know

13:39.249 --> 13:41.928
I appreciated you
backing me up last night,

13:41.952 --> 13:44.170
you know, with the kiss thing.

13:44.194 --> 13:46.908
To be honest, I don't think
I would've liked it, either.

13:46.932 --> 13:49.505
Yeah, but I probably
should've just gone with it.

13:49.529 --> 13:51.938
Gaby was just being Gaby...
Having fun.

13:51.962 --> 13:55.289
No, I wouldn't be so hard
on yourself, given her history.

13:55.313 --> 13:57.283
What do you mean?

13:57.307 --> 14:00.446
You know, the affair.
Gaby had an affair?

14:00.470 --> 14:02.048
You didn't know? No!

14:02.072 --> 14:04.550
I thought everybody knew.

14:04.574 --> 14:07.053
Oh, I feel awful.

14:07.077 --> 14:08.824
Oh, ida Greenberg's behind you.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.827
Ida, just a second.

14:11.851 --> 14:15.231
I am stunned. Who was it with?

14:15.255 --> 14:17.133
I shouldn't have said anything.

14:17.157 --> 14:19.257
Bree, come on, just tell me.

14:20.891 --> 14:23.191
Her gardener.

14:25.996 --> 14:27.843
Oh, you're kidding!

14:27.867 --> 14:30.176
No, no, not him.
Helen rowland's son, John.

14:30.200 --> 14:31.847
The teenager?

14:33.873 --> 14:36.322
Ida, wait, or go around!

14:36.346 --> 14:38.324
Does Gaby know that you know?

14:38.348 --> 14:39.625
Absolutely not.

14:39.649 --> 14:41.627
I think the best thing to do

14:41.651 --> 14:44.481
is just smile and pretend
you don't know anything.

14:56.566 --> 14:58.166
Huh.

15:00.070 --> 15:01.908
Hi.

15:01.932 --> 15:03.002
Oh, sorry!

15:05.005 --> 15:06.012
Are you okay?

15:06.036 --> 15:08.985
Yeah.

15:09.009 --> 15:11.887
I'm all right. What's up?

15:11.911 --> 15:14.611
We have an idea how to bring
you and Zach together.

15:16.046 --> 15:18.164
Bowling. Bowling?

15:18.188 --> 15:20.166
Yeah, I e-mailed Zach,

15:20.190 --> 15:22.498
and he said he's gonna meet
us there. You can come, too.

15:22.522 --> 15:24.200
Does Paul know about this?

15:24.224 --> 15:28.104
No, and we're not planning
on telling him.

15:28.128 --> 15:32.108
I don't think
that's a good idea, Susan.

15:32.132 --> 15:35.246
Mike, I'm part of the reason
things got so screwed up.

15:35.270 --> 15:37.944
I just want a chance
to make things right.

15:37.968 --> 15:41.047
And you're okay with this...
Being around Zach?

15:41.071 --> 15:44.951
We talked to him. He's changed.

15:44.975 --> 15:49.675
Well, I guess
we're going bowling.

15:51.982 --> 15:53.259
Wake up, sleepyhead.

15:53.283 --> 15:56.293
I brought fresh croissants
for breakfast!

16:03.693 --> 16:06.672
Uh, hi, Mrs. Van De Kamp.

16:06.696 --> 16:09.296
I'm Justin,
Andrew's lab partner...

16:10.400 --> 16:12.478
From school.

16:12.502 --> 16:14.080
Dude, wake up.

16:14.104 --> 16:16.382
Andrew...

16:16.406 --> 16:18.746
I want you downstairs... Now.

16:29.359 --> 16:31.337
Okay, first of all, I want you
to march back upstairs

16:31.361 --> 16:34.570
and tell your friend he is
no longer welcome in this house.

16:34.594 --> 16:37.151
But we haven't even had
breakfast yet! I am serious, Andrew.

16:37.175 --> 16:40.106
You tell him
to get out of here this second

16:40.130 --> 16:43.009
or I will call the police, and I will have
him removed! Well, go ahead, call 'em.

16:43.033 --> 16:44.480
Oh, you think I won't?

16:44.504 --> 16:47.183
I just wonder how they'll react

16:47.207 --> 16:50.207
when they find out that
you killed George Williams.

16:51.711 --> 16:53.659
I didn't kill George.

16:53.683 --> 16:56.167
Well, no, but you sat there
and let him die,

16:56.191 --> 16:58.164
which, I'm no lawyer,
but I'm pretty sure

16:58.188 --> 17:00.226
there's a crime
in there somewhere.

17:00.250 --> 17:01.567
Andrew...

17:01.591 --> 17:04.470
Don't get me wrong.
I mean, I'm glad you did it.

17:04.493 --> 17:07.778
But when the cops get here,
my official position will be,

17:07.801 --> 17:10.527
uh, "oh, my god, I'm being
raised by a homicidal maniac."

17:12.202 --> 17:15.080
I think I might even
throw in a few tears.

17:15.105 --> 17:17.113
You would actually
let the police

17:17.137 --> 17:18.614
arrest your own mother?

17:18.637 --> 17:21.738
Hey, we all gotta cut
the apron strings at some point.

17:36.256 --> 17:39.165
Come on, penny. Let's get
those groceries in there.

17:39.189 --> 17:41.507
Come on. Here we go.
Get this one...

17:41.531 --> 17:43.509
And this one,
and daddy... uh-oh! Whoa!

17:45.465 --> 17:47.243
Oh!

17:47.267 --> 17:50.045
Oh, it looks like
you could use a hand.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.648
Bless you. Here, Gaby.

17:52.672 --> 17:54.150
And penny!

17:54.174 --> 17:57.052
Oh, come here,
you sweet little thing.

17:57.076 --> 18:00.055
Well, thank you so much, Gaby.
Come on in.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.057
Oh, god, um, Tom?

18:02.081 --> 18:03.058
Yeah?

18:03.082 --> 18:05.791
Uh, I think she got sick.

18:05.815 --> 18:08.094
Oh, I'm so sorry.

18:08.118 --> 18:11.237
Usually, she only throws up
on immediate family.

18:11.261 --> 18:12.768
I'm honored.

18:12.792 --> 18:16.279
Oh, um, do you mind just putting
her in the playpen there?

18:18.498 --> 18:20.106
Hello.

18:20.130 --> 18:23.279
Guess what? Ed loved the pitch.
I got off early!

18:23.303 --> 18:25.156
You're kidding! That's great!

18:25.180 --> 18:27.253
Hey, I'm right
by the supermarket.

18:27.277 --> 18:29.255
You want me to pick up anything? Um,
actually, I just came from there.

18:29.279 --> 18:30.816
Except, you know what?
I forgot bread.

18:30.840 --> 18:33.088
Would you mind? Not at all.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.790
Tom, I need to wipe up.
Do you have a towel?

18:34.814 --> 18:37.424
Sure, hold on.

18:44.754 --> 18:46.802
Hey!

18:46.826 --> 18:49.635
Hey, honey.
Hey, did you get the bread?

18:49.659 --> 18:51.307
Oh, yeah, they were out.

18:51.331 --> 18:52.638
Of bread?

18:52.662 --> 18:55.641
Yeah. Hey, Gaby.
A surprise seeingyouhere.

18:55.665 --> 18:57.643
Well, I saw that Tom
was overwhelmed,

18:57.667 --> 18:59.545
so I thought
I'd give him a hand.

18:59.569 --> 19:03.449
Really?
Wow, that was nice of you.

19:03.473 --> 19:05.553
Is there a problem?

19:07.146 --> 19:08.146
No.

19:11.451 --> 19:14.560
Really? Because I sense
that you're annoyed

19:14.584 --> 19:17.834
you found me here when
you weren't home. Am I wrong?

19:20.690 --> 19:22.868
Lynette?

19:22.892 --> 19:26.542
Okay. Yeah.

19:26.566 --> 19:29.775
So exactly what are you
doing here helping out?

19:29.799 --> 19:31.777
Damn it, Lynette, if this
has to do with that stupid kiss

19:31.801 --> 19:33.419
the other night,
I'm gonna lose it!

19:33.443 --> 19:35.456
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what's going on?

19:35.480 --> 19:38.384
Lynette thinks I was hitting
on you at Bree's party.

19:38.408 --> 19:39.555
(Laughing that's ridiculous.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.557
I never saidthat.
What I said was

19:41.581 --> 19:43.859
that it made me uncomfortable
when you kissed him.

19:43.883 --> 19:46.632
It's obviously an issue for me.

19:46.656 --> 19:50.196
And yet, here you are, alone in
my kitchen with my husband.

19:50.220 --> 19:52.768
So you tell me,
are you hitting on him? Lynette.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.770
I can't believe you.
I have done nothing

19:54.794 --> 19:56.581
to deserve this kind
of mistrust.

19:56.605 --> 19:59.305
Well, that's not entirely true.

19:59.329 --> 20:01.277
What does that mean?

20:01.301 --> 20:03.831
Come on, Gaby.
It's a small town. People talk.

20:08.278 --> 20:10.556
Okay, what's going on here?

20:10.580 --> 20:13.219
I'll tell you.

20:13.243 --> 20:15.596
Your wife doesn't trust me
around you

20:15.620 --> 20:18.645
because I had an affair
with my teenage gardener.

20:23.323 --> 20:26.733
Oh.

20:28.658 --> 20:31.337
So I know Susan Mayer
would never tell.

20:31.361 --> 20:33.208
It must've been Helen rowland.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.210
She probably blabbed
to all the girls at the salon.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.917
And ida Greenberg
goes to that salon.

20:36.941 --> 20:38.684
So if ida knows,
the whole town knows.

20:38.708 --> 20:42.288
And we're just gonna have to
move. That's all there is to it.

20:42.312 --> 20:44.290
Carlos, can you stop putting
for two seconds

20:44.314 --> 20:45.857
and show me some support?

20:45.881 --> 20:48.594
What do you expect me to do?
You brought this on yourself.

20:48.618 --> 20:50.596
It was a harmless little kiss!

20:50.620 --> 20:53.359
Why is everybody making
a big deal about this?

20:53.383 --> 20:55.230
Because you had an affair
with an underage gardener.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.241
People don't think
you're harmless.

20:57.265 --> 20:59.234
They see you as a predator.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.307
You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

21:01.331 --> 21:04.470
Punishing me, dangling
the affair over my head?

21:04.494 --> 21:06.344
Well, I won't tolerate it.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.475
Really?

21:09.499 --> 21:11.999
So just what are you
gonna do about it?

21:17.407 --> 21:19.685
I'm gonna let you
even the score.

21:19.709 --> 21:22.558
Carlos, go have an affair. What?

21:22.582 --> 21:24.560
I had my little indiscretion.

21:24.584 --> 21:27.398
So you go have yours.
Get it out of your system.

21:27.422 --> 21:28.894
I know you want to. I do not.

21:28.918 --> 21:30.866
Sure you do. Knock yourself out.

21:30.890 --> 21:34.370
Call up an old college flame.
Rent a call girl.

21:34.394 --> 21:35.671
Fly to Africa

21:35.695 --> 21:38.344
and nail that little nun
you've been drooling over.

21:38.368 --> 21:40.406
I don't care!

21:40.430 --> 21:41.747
You're crazy.

21:41.771 --> 21:43.849
No, I'm pragmatic.

21:43.873 --> 21:45.860
Because once
you finish your fling,

21:45.884 --> 21:47.853
we'll be equals again.

21:47.877 --> 21:49.785
And then you won't
be able to judge me.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.787
And we can go back to being

21:51.811 --> 21:53.619
a boring, average
married couple.

21:53.643 --> 21:57.393
Oh, just do me a favor.
Don't bring back any diseases.

22:02.352 --> 22:04.630
Are you sure you're not
overreacting

22:04.654 --> 22:07.032
to this whole Gabrielle thing?

22:07.056 --> 22:08.334
Maybe.

22:08.358 --> 22:09.805
Yes.

22:09.829 --> 22:14.510
But Gaby doesn't think
she did anything wrong.

22:14.534 --> 22:18.344
That's not right, either.

22:18.368 --> 22:19.645
I guess.

22:19.669 --> 22:21.647
You're an attractive man.

22:21.671 --> 22:25.498
There is a primal need for
a woman to protect what is hers.

22:25.522 --> 22:28.053
My initial impulse
was justified.

22:28.077 --> 22:31.927
So you really think
she's into me?

22:31.951 --> 22:35.100
I don't know.

22:35.124 --> 22:38.504
Because you're right.
Iaman attractive man.

22:38.528 --> 22:40.466
You know what?
I've never told you this,

22:40.490 --> 22:42.738
but sometimes when I bend down
to pick up the morning paper,

22:42.762 --> 22:45.110
I catch Bree Van De Kamp
checking me out.

22:45.134 --> 22:47.473
You're kidding.

22:47.497 --> 22:49.745
No, scout's honor.
I've always exuded

22:49.769 --> 22:53.449
a certain sexual magnetism,
and as I get older,

22:53.473 --> 22:55.530
I think it's only
becoming more intense.

22:55.554 --> 22:57.423
Are you drunk?

22:57.447 --> 22:59.655
Oh, I'm a hot guy
living in a neighborhood

22:59.679 --> 23:01.527
filled with nothing
but lonely ladies.

23:01.551 --> 23:02.928
Oh.

23:02.952 --> 23:06.462
They can't help themselves.
I'm like... catnip.

23:06.486 --> 23:08.486
Come here.

23:09.989 --> 23:11.467
What was that for?

23:11.491 --> 23:13.469
Thank you.
Thank you for reminding me

23:13.493 --> 23:16.472
that I am the only woman
in the whole world

23:16.496 --> 23:18.726
who could love anidiotlike you.

23:20.830 --> 23:22.808
I'll talk to Gaby.
I'm telling you,

23:22.832 --> 23:25.711
these women want me. Oh, yeah.

23:25.735 --> 23:28.113
They see the rippling muscles
underneath this t-shirt...

23:28.137 --> 23:30.486
Good night, Tom.
They cannot resist me.

23:30.510 --> 23:32.017
Shut up and go to sleep.

23:32.041 --> 23:33.959
Aah!

24:29.499 --> 24:31.469
Son of a bitch.

24:40.950 --> 24:43.610
You gotta be kidding me.

24:46.556 --> 24:48.564
Whoa, whoa.

24:48.588 --> 24:50.118
I'm here to help you, Caleb.

24:52.522 --> 24:54.192
All right?

24:56.225 --> 24:58.804
Mama's gon' be mad.

24:58.828 --> 25:00.568
Don't you worry about that.

25:03.272 --> 25:05.202
Moms love me.

25:08.107 --> 25:10.055
All right, let's go.

25:10.079 --> 25:12.239
No!

25:15.615 --> 25:18.624
Okay, I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have talked to you like that.

25:18.648 --> 25:20.548
Let's start over.

25:21.991 --> 25:23.691
Aah!

25:36.906 --> 25:39.606
Let's go.

25:41.070 --> 25:43.589
I'm warning you, pinhead,

25:43.613 --> 25:45.653
don't you make me
come down there after you.

25:47.246 --> 25:48.523
Come on.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.277
Come on!

25:54.784 --> 25:56.067
All right, you asked for it.

25:56.091 --> 25:58.225
I'm gonna beat the stupid
right out of you.

25:59.558 --> 26:00.936
Aah!

26:06.696 --> 26:07.996
Oh!

26:17.777 --> 26:22.858
This hit the spot.

26:30.620 --> 26:32.167
Caleb?

26:32.191 --> 26:34.991
I didn't do it.

26:46.605 --> 26:49.805
Oh, dear.

27:02.722 --> 27:04.700
Well, hey there.

27:04.724 --> 27:06.164
Hi, Karl. Oh!

27:08.027 --> 27:10.135
Oh, um, quick question...

27:10.159 --> 27:13.639
When someone discusses
a sensitive situation

27:13.663 --> 27:15.610
with a lawyer such as yourself,

27:15.634 --> 27:18.148
when does attorney/client
confidentiality kick in?

27:18.172 --> 27:20.385
From the moment
the lawyer's been hired. Why?

27:20.409 --> 27:21.887
Here's a check for $100.

27:21.911 --> 27:24.189
That's enough
for a retainer, right?

27:24.213 --> 27:27.222
Well, I guess.
What's going on, Bree?

27:27.246 --> 27:29.224
My son is trying
to blackmail me.

27:29.248 --> 27:31.626
And I want you to stop
the little s.O.B.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.650
Do you think you could do that?

27:35.825 --> 27:39.404
He has an Illinois license.

27:39.428 --> 27:42.267
It says here his name is munroe.

27:42.291 --> 27:44.940
Does that name
mean anything to you?

27:44.964 --> 27:49.844
No, but at least
he wasn't a policeman.

27:52.101 --> 27:53.819
Poor man.

27:53.843 --> 27:56.060
I hope he didn't
suffer too much.

27:56.084 --> 27:59.925
Mom, are we
looking at the same body?

28:19.869 --> 28:21.799
What is it?

28:30.709 --> 28:32.858
As soon as it gets dark,

28:32.882 --> 28:35.791
we get rid of that body.

28:38.888 --> 28:41.096
Hey.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.068
Um...

28:43.092 --> 28:45.130
I hope it's okay.
Carlos let me in.

28:45.154 --> 28:47.781
Actually, I'm right
in the middle of something,

28:47.805 --> 28:50.275
and I don't know
when I'll be done.

28:53.732 --> 28:57.282
I'm just here to say I am sorry,

28:57.306 --> 29:01.747
and I have been
a complete idiot.

29:03.342 --> 29:05.782
All done.

29:09.819 --> 29:12.928
So cute. 'Cause it's beautiful!

29:12.952 --> 29:14.930
Is the coast clear?

29:14.954 --> 29:16.867
Yes, it is. We worked it out.

29:16.891 --> 29:19.364
No kidding.
How'd you manage that one?

29:19.388 --> 29:23.268
Simple. Lynette admitted
she was wrong, and I agreed.

29:23.292 --> 29:25.771
Well, 99% wrong.

29:25.795 --> 29:27.142
Oh, whatever, close enough.

29:27.166 --> 29:30.745
Anyway, Tom's probably got
dinner ready by now.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.047
So I should get goin'.

29:32.071 --> 29:33.919
Okay.

29:33.943 --> 29:36.113
Good night. Bye! Mwah!

29:39.778 --> 29:41.787
You know what the 1% is, right?

29:41.811 --> 29:44.129
No, not really.

29:44.153 --> 29:46.131
Does it matter?

29:46.155 --> 29:47.833
It kinda does.

29:47.857 --> 29:51.236
I wanna get it clear
for our friendship.

29:51.260 --> 29:52.998
Okay.

29:53.022 --> 29:54.970
What's the 1%?

29:54.994 --> 29:57.302
Well, well...

29:57.326 --> 29:58.804
Yes, I overreacted.

29:58.828 --> 30:01.807
I think you can see

30:01.831 --> 30:04.379
how even though
I was somewhat off base,

30:04.403 --> 30:06.852
you were a little wrong, right?

30:06.876 --> 30:12.157
No. I kissed Tom,
and it was a harmless joke.

30:12.181 --> 30:14.159
I think if I had kissed
anybody else's husband,

30:14.183 --> 30:15.861
they would've laughed

30:15.885 --> 30:17.362
and then forgot about it
ten seconds later.

30:17.386 --> 30:21.146
Okay, let's test that theory.

30:25.194 --> 30:28.974
See? I don't care.

30:28.998 --> 30:33.909
That's...
Just a waste of time...

30:33.933 --> 30:35.403
And spit.

30:38.938 --> 30:41.987
Oh. Okay.

30:42.011 --> 30:43.488
Okay, okay, okay.

30:43.512 --> 30:44.489
Okay! Okay!

30:44.513 --> 30:47.322
I get your point.

30:47.346 --> 30:50.455
All righty, then,
my work here is done.

30:50.479 --> 30:53.249
Carlos, Gaby.

30:59.328 --> 31:00.928
Go!

31:02.031 --> 31:03.138
Not bad.

31:03.162 --> 31:07.012
Hey, there he is.

31:07.036 --> 31:09.344
Zach, I'm glad
you could make it.

31:09.368 --> 31:12.017
Hey, Zach.

31:12.041 --> 31:14.119
Mr. Delfino, I didn't know
you were gonna be here.

31:14.143 --> 31:16.856
Yeah, I was just bowling a few
frames and ran into these guys.

31:16.880 --> 31:19.925
I thought I might join you.
Is, uh, that okay?

31:19.949 --> 31:21.649
Yeah, I guess.

31:26.655 --> 31:28.133
Oh!

31:28.157 --> 31:30.135
Okay, write that down... nine!

31:30.159 --> 31:32.968
Wise guy.

31:32.992 --> 31:36.002
All right, just roll it
in there nice and easy.

31:44.373 --> 31:46.151
Sorry.

31:46.175 --> 31:48.153
It's okay. We're still close.

31:48.177 --> 31:49.955
Anyway,
Julie's totally gonna choke.

31:49.979 --> 31:52.187
Just for that, I am not
bringing you back a hot dog.

31:52.211 --> 31:54.189
Zach, do you want one?

31:54.213 --> 31:55.220
Okay.

31:55.244 --> 31:57.094
Okay.

32:07.056 --> 32:07.933
You okay?

32:07.957 --> 32:09.935
Yeah, I'm fine, it's just...

32:09.959 --> 32:12.978
I don't understand
what you're doing.

32:13.002 --> 32:14.279
What do you mean?

32:14.303 --> 32:17.117
Well, I don't understand why
you're being so nice to me.

32:17.141 --> 32:20.036
I mean, I pointed a gun
at you guys. You should hate me.

32:22.671 --> 32:24.489
We don't hate you, Zach.

32:24.513 --> 32:27.122
You had an incredibly hard year.

32:27.146 --> 32:29.694
And you shouldn't have done
what you did,

32:29.718 --> 32:32.457
but we just wanna
help you move on.

32:32.481 --> 32:33.999
Look, um...

32:34.023 --> 32:35.600
When I was young,

32:35.624 --> 32:37.437
I got mixed up
in some really bad stuff.

32:37.461 --> 32:39.504
I even did some
time in prison. Really?

32:39.528 --> 32:42.507
Yeah, but when I got out, people
were willing to forgive me.

32:42.531 --> 32:46.001
Everybody deserves a
second chance. Thanks.

32:47.997 --> 32:51.316
You know, I'm gonna go, uh,
help Julie with the food.

32:51.340 --> 32:53.318
So you guys just keep talking
and bowling.

32:53.342 --> 32:55.050
Talk and bowl.

32:55.074 --> 32:56.714
Bowl and talk.

32:58.047 --> 32:59.524
Here, let me show you something.

32:59.548 --> 33:02.057
See the arrows
right in the middle?

33:02.081 --> 33:05.030
Just roll it straight over
the one in the center. Okay.

33:05.054 --> 33:07.037
You don't have to spin it
or anything.

33:07.061 --> 33:08.656
Just right down the middle.

33:11.390 --> 33:14.039
Look at that!

33:14.063 --> 33:15.563
Good job.

33:22.101 --> 33:23.378
Hurry up!

33:23.402 --> 33:25.002
I am hurrying up, okay?

33:27.236 --> 33:28.713
Wait, no! No! No!

33:28.737 --> 33:30.455
What? I dropped the keys.

33:30.479 --> 33:32.539
I don't have 'em.
They're in here!

33:45.324 --> 33:48.064
Sometimes
you just have to laugh.

34:04.173 --> 34:06.151
Andrew?

34:06.175 --> 34:08.493
Would you mind
turning off your video game?

34:08.516 --> 34:12.177
My lawyer would like
to have a little chat with you.

34:15.224 --> 34:16.701
So even though

34:16.725 --> 34:18.533
your mother did witness
George Williams' suicide,

34:18.556 --> 34:21.034
there's no affirmative duty
to intervene.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.068
Therefore,
no crime was committed.

34:23.092 --> 34:25.570
Even if the police find out,

34:25.594 --> 34:29.114
your mom will never see
the inside of a courtroom.

34:29.138 --> 34:30.745
Well, maybe I got
the story wrong.

34:30.768 --> 34:33.478
What if she went over there
to help him commit suicide?

34:33.502 --> 34:36.426
If you wanna lie to the police,
go right ahead.

34:36.449 --> 34:38.422
But please know
that I will sue you.

34:38.447 --> 34:40.185
For what?

34:40.208 --> 34:42.327
Abuse of process.

34:42.351 --> 34:45.130
It's when a person tries
to exploit the legal system

34:45.154 --> 34:47.541
for an improper purpose...
Like blackmail.

34:47.565 --> 34:50.335
You guys can't sue me.
I'm just a kid.

34:50.359 --> 34:51.835
Oh, don't worry.

34:51.860 --> 34:54.739
I won't start garnishing
your wages until you turn 18.

34:54.763 --> 34:57.702
Your mom...
Is she a peach or what?

34:57.726 --> 35:01.606
If the cops don't give a damn,
I'm sure your friends will.

35:01.630 --> 35:03.730
How does a little
public humiliation sound?

35:05.674 --> 35:08.314
Bree, can I get
a refill on this?

35:15.784 --> 35:17.792
What are you doing?!

35:17.816 --> 35:19.764
Your father
was a friend of mine.

35:19.788 --> 35:22.167
And if he were around to see
what a nasty little turd

35:22.191 --> 35:25.400
you've turned into,
he'd knock the hell out of you.

35:25.424 --> 35:28.733
Yeah, well,
he's not here now, is he?

35:28.757 --> 35:31.736
No, he isn't, but if you
don't get your act together

35:31.760 --> 35:34.239
and start treating your mother
with some respect,

35:34.263 --> 35:37.612
I'll take care of you myself.

35:37.636 --> 35:41.586
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

35:41.610 --> 35:43.248
Yeah.

35:43.272 --> 35:44.772
Good.

35:53.422 --> 35:54.899
Hey, neighbor.

35:54.923 --> 35:57.162
Oh, hey, Carlos.

35:57.186 --> 35:58.363
Hi.

35:58.387 --> 36:01.206
I just wanted to thank you for
patching things up with Gaby.

36:01.230 --> 36:03.368
Well, sure, no problem.

36:03.392 --> 36:05.370
It's been really tough on her...

36:05.394 --> 36:08.142
Everybody finding out
about the affair.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.475
Yeah, I can imagine.

36:10.499 --> 36:12.677
I don't mind telling you,
it's, uh...

36:12.701 --> 36:14.719
It's been pretty tough on us
the past couple months.

36:14.743 --> 36:17.282
Oh, well, I'm not surprised,

36:17.306 --> 36:20.285
and I really, really hope
you can work it out.

36:20.309 --> 36:22.257
Yeah, we're trying. You know...

36:22.281 --> 36:23.888
Mm-hmm? Yeah?

36:23.912 --> 36:27.161
Gaby had
an interesting suggestion.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.162
Oh?

36:28.186 --> 36:31.296
She told me that I should go out

36:31.320 --> 36:33.298
and have an affair of my own.

36:33.322 --> 36:34.939
She thinks it's the only way

36:34.963 --> 36:36.946
I'll be able to get over
what she did to me

36:36.970 --> 36:39.244
and that it just might
help our marriage.

36:39.268 --> 36:41.646
Why are you telling me this?

36:41.670 --> 36:43.348
Uh...

36:43.372 --> 36:46.351
I guess I just, uh...

36:46.375 --> 36:49.775
Wanted to know if you had
any thoughts on the subject?

36:51.580 --> 36:53.788
I... don't.

36:53.812 --> 36:56.321
I really don't.

36:56.345 --> 37:00.845
Well, if you ever do,
let me know.

37:02.691 --> 37:04.599
By the way...

37:04.623 --> 37:05.930
Mm-hmm?

37:05.954 --> 37:09.704
That was one hell
of a kiss you gave me.

37:09.728 --> 37:13.558
You can't fake
chemistry like that.

37:46.295 --> 37:48.435
What the hell is this?

38:01.380 --> 38:03.388
Delfino?

38:03.412 --> 38:05.290
Uhh!

38:05.314 --> 38:08.524
Stay away from my son!

38:17.896 --> 38:20.274
Oh, my god!

38:28.306 --> 38:30.376
Dad!

38:33.442 --> 38:34.889
You okay? I'm fine.

38:34.913 --> 38:37.493
Aah!

39:04.513 --> 39:06.796
So I swerved
to avoid hitting his car,

39:06.820 --> 39:08.793
and I hit this parked car
instead,

39:08.817 --> 39:10.795
and that's when
the trunk popped open,

39:10.819 --> 39:14.019
and when we got out, we found
this dead body and...

39:18.427 --> 39:20.435
Are you worried now?

39:20.459 --> 39:23.107
'Cause I am.

39:23.131 --> 39:26.771
Not yet. Just be patient.
See what happens.

39:28.697 --> 39:30.375
How'd it go?

39:30.399 --> 39:32.377
Well, I told him
everything I know,

39:32.401 --> 39:34.519
which wasn't much.

39:34.543 --> 39:36.426
So are we thinking this is Paul?

39:36.450 --> 39:38.553
Well, he is our friendly
neighborhood murderer.

39:38.577 --> 39:40.555
Yeah, it seems obvious.

39:40.579 --> 39:43.458
I don't know. I saw his face
when he looked in the trunk.

39:43.482 --> 39:45.430
And he looked
just as shocked as I was.

39:45.454 --> 39:48.092
I'm thinking
it's the applewhites.

39:48.116 --> 39:49.734
I talked to the dead guy,

39:49.758 --> 39:52.597
and he said that he was doing
an appraisal on their house.

39:52.621 --> 39:54.599
Well, I got a little cheesed,

39:54.623 --> 39:56.610
so I called every realtor
in town.

39:56.634 --> 39:58.573
Nobody had even heard of him.

39:58.597 --> 40:01.546
That doesn't mean
Betty knew him.

40:01.570 --> 40:03.448
Please. Those two are fishy.

40:03.472 --> 40:06.451
They bought that house
sight unseen,

40:06.475 --> 40:09.414
and they did move in
in the middle of the night.

40:09.438 --> 40:12.617
And there were the noises.
What noises?

40:12.641 --> 40:15.760
Oh, a couple of weeks ago,
um, I heard some noises

40:15.784 --> 40:17.771
coming from the basement,
like a clanging.

40:17.795 --> 40:19.924
And I asked Betty about it.

40:19.948 --> 40:21.766
She lied right to my face.

40:21.790 --> 40:24.450
What's that about? I don't know.

40:35.504 --> 40:37.014
Now I'm worried.

40:55.524 --> 40:56.764
Julie!

41:03.662 --> 41:04.639
Hi.

41:04.663 --> 41:05.770
Hey.

41:05.794 --> 41:07.772
My, uh, dad found out
about us bowling.

41:07.796 --> 41:09.574
I'm not gonna be able
to do that anytime soon.

41:09.598 --> 41:13.618
Oh. Sorry.

41:13.642 --> 41:15.620
No, no, I'm glad that we did.

41:15.644 --> 41:17.561
I haven't felt like part
of a family in a long time.

41:17.585 --> 41:18.876
Thanks.

41:20.779 --> 41:23.909
I, um, I better get back inside.

41:27.856 --> 41:31.065
The act itself never varies.

41:31.089 --> 41:36.070
But each kiss carries with it
a meaning all its own.

41:36.094 --> 41:41.676
It can convey
a husband's eternal devotion...

41:41.700 --> 41:45.530
Or a wife's enormous regret.

41:49.007 --> 41:53.277
It can symbolize
a mother's growing concern...

41:56.885 --> 42:00.115
Or a lover's growing passion.

42:01.590 --> 42:04.098
But whatever its meaning,

42:04.122 --> 42:08.573
each kiss...

42:08.597 --> 42:11.175
Reflects a basic human need.

42:11.199 --> 42:12.699
Mommy's baby.

42:15.664 --> 42:21.644
The need to connect
to another human being.

42:23.171 --> 42:27.121
This desire is so strong,

42:27.145 --> 42:31.696
it'salways amazing
when some people...

42:31.720 --> 42:33.720
Don't understand it.
