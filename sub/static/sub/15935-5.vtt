00:13.468 --> 00:15.433
Previously on Masters of Sex...

00:15.468 --> 00:17.201
As soon as the mic picks
up people talking,

00:17.237 --> 00:19.737
the tape recorders in
my office start recording.

00:19.773 --> 00:22.941
I can't imagine any new hire
agreeing to be listened in on.

00:22.976 --> 00:25.843
If we had tape recorders
in this office two months ago,

00:25.879 --> 00:28.513
we wouldn't be staring down
the barrel of criminal charges.

00:28.548 --> 00:32.083
The charges are pandering
and prostitution.

00:32.118 --> 00:34.252
But my job at
Little Brown is on the line

00:34.287 --> 00:35.720
with this new book as well.

00:35.755 --> 00:38.089
You're sure Virginia understood
to bring a date?

00:38.124 --> 00:39.702
She wouldn't have said yes
if she were still mad

00:39.726 --> 00:41.070
about us hiding that we're married.

00:41.094 --> 00:43.294
It's a fucking key party with coats.

00:43.330 --> 00:44.295
Who does this belong to?

00:44.331 --> 00:45.563
- All right!
- Whoo!

00:45.598 --> 00:46.809
If you think that we're going to bed,

00:46.833 --> 00:48.399
you're insane.

00:48.435 --> 00:50.802
I think the damage is done
whether we mess around or not.

00:50.837 --> 00:52.370
I just got back from the doctor.

00:52.405 --> 00:53.771
I'm pregnant.

00:53.807 --> 00:56.441
My girlfriend's parents are in town.

00:56.476 --> 00:59.577
Are you the carpool buddy
or the office colleague?

00:59.612 --> 01:00.878
Next-door neighbor.

01:00.914 --> 01:02.714
I want you to do something for me

01:02.749 --> 01:05.316
for the sole purpose
of giving me pleasure.

01:07.120 --> 01:08.130
Let's not make too much of it.

01:08.154 --> 01:10.488
Let's not make too little.

01:10.523 --> 01:12.957
And bosses shouldn't sleep
with their employees.

01:12.993 --> 01:14.258
It happens.

01:14.294 --> 01:16.294
Maybe he's the guy for you, Virginia.

01:19.366 --> 01:20.798
Oh.

02:02.969 --> 02:06.947
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> - 
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

02:08.247 --> 02:10.214
I thought she was
being cagey in her intake,

02:10.250 --> 02:12.116
but Virginia disagrees.

02:12.152 --> 02:14.819
She wants to first rule out
any physiological issues.

02:14.854 --> 02:16.721
Was Virginia like that the other night?

02:16.756 --> 02:18.367
What are you talking about?

02:18.391 --> 02:21.225
I know how much you
like take charge women.

02:21.261 --> 02:22.360
What?

02:22.395 --> 02:24.162
Was she the boss in bed, too?

02:24.197 --> 02:26.164
- Nance, come on.
- I'm curious.

02:26.199 --> 02:28.666
What about the rule? We
don't share specifics.

02:28.701 --> 02:31.035
I think this warrants an
exception, don't you?

02:31.071 --> 02:33.171
The woman's a world renowned sex expert.

02:33.206 --> 02:36.007
Maybe I could, uh,
could learn a thing or two.

02:38.111 --> 02:40.211
Well...

02:40.246 --> 02:41.979
she's an attentive lover.

02:42.015 --> 02:43.381
Attentive...

02:50.023 --> 02:52.156
I can always tell
it's you heading this way.

02:52.192 --> 02:54.826
You walk with purpose.

02:54.861 --> 02:56.160
Did something happen?

02:56.196 --> 02:57.562
Your wife seems to think so.

02:57.597 --> 03:00.098
I'm, uh, "an attentive lover"?

03:01.601 --> 03:04.569
W... where did you hear that?

03:04.604 --> 03:06.571
Does it matter where I heard it, Art?

03:06.606 --> 03:08.573
It was a swingers' party.

03:08.608 --> 03:10.575
She saw us go into a bedroom together

03:10.610 --> 03:13.077
a-and she knows you
stayed till morning.

03:13.113 --> 03:14.879
And yet I vividly remember telling you

03:14.914 --> 03:16.948
that you needed to
be honest with your wife

03:16.983 --> 03:19.717
about what did not happen between us.

03:19.752 --> 03:21.285
She just assumed.

03:21.321 --> 03:24.355
She didn't just assume.
You confirmed it.

03:24.390 --> 03:26.390
She wouldn't think any
less of you, Virginia.

03:26.426 --> 03:28.092
In fact, quite the contrary.

03:28.128 --> 03:31.062
No, it's you that she would
think less of, isn't it,

03:31.097 --> 03:33.264
if we didn't have sex?

03:33.299 --> 03:36.234
Sounds like your problem to deal with

03:36.269 --> 03:37.668
with your wife.

03:39.472 --> 03:42.974
Is this about Bill?

03:43.009 --> 03:46.110
You shared some pretty intimate
truths with me that night.

03:46.146 --> 03:47.879
I-I think it's...

03:47.914 --> 03:50.314
I think it's safe
to assume that the man...

03:50.350 --> 03:52.383
Oh, it's not safe to assume anything.

03:52.418 --> 03:55.286
But something happened
between you and Bill...

03:55.321 --> 03:57.155
A rupture of some sort...

03:57.190 --> 03:59.957
And you're worried if he thinks
you and I slept together...

03:59.993 --> 04:04.829
Are you familiar with the
concept of a stand-off, Art?

04:04.864 --> 04:07.565
Essentially, it's
two people holding guns

04:07.600 --> 04:11.135
at each other's heads.

04:11.171 --> 04:13.437
There may be things
that you think that you know

04:13.473 --> 04:16.307
about my private life, certain
assumptions that you've made,

04:16.341 --> 04:19.944
and there certainly are things
that I know about yours,

04:19.978 --> 04:21.978
things, that if I chose
to tell your wife,

04:22.015 --> 04:24.749
would devastate your marriage.

04:24.784 --> 04:27.618
But I don't want to have to do that.

04:30.290 --> 04:33.457
Besides, you're an asset to the clinic.

04:33.493 --> 04:35.493
We would hate to lose you.

04:38.364 --> 04:40.731
I'll... talk to Nancy.

05:00.587 --> 05:03.387
I'm sitting there in my car, right?

05:03.423 --> 05:05.957
Fifteen minutes
till Sheryl's shift ends.

05:05.992 --> 05:09.994
And all I see is that red neon
sign across the street,

05:10.029 --> 05:12.363
"cocktails."

05:12.398 --> 05:14.632
Start doin' the math.

05:14.667 --> 05:16.412
Is there enough time
for me to knock one back

05:16.436 --> 05:18.970
before Sheryl punches out?

05:19.005 --> 05:21.138
Will she smell the booze?

05:21.174 --> 05:22.807
Then I think how it took me 20 years

05:22.842 --> 05:25.643
to get 20 days of sobriety, and...

05:25.678 --> 05:27.845
seems like it's too much to give up.

05:29.549 --> 05:30.982
Thanks for listening.

05:34.020 --> 05:36.220
Thank you, Jerry.

05:36.256 --> 05:41.225
Tonight, someone in the group
is here for his last meeting.

05:41.261 --> 05:43.027
Congratulations, Bill.

05:43.062 --> 05:47.498
90 meetings in 90 days...
That's no small feat.

05:47.533 --> 05:51.369
Now, traditionally,
before a person leaves us,

05:51.404 --> 05:55.439
they take this time to tell the
group something they've learned

05:55.475 --> 05:59.076
or something they'd like to share.

06:05.551 --> 06:09.086
Good luck... to you all.

06:24.570 --> 06:26.637
Good night and good luck.

06:26.673 --> 06:28.773
You're a regular Edward Morrow.

06:28.808 --> 06:30.808
What was I gonna say?

06:30.843 --> 06:32.243
I never belonged here.

06:32.278 --> 06:34.145
Well, you made that very clear,

06:34.180 --> 06:35.713
sitting there checking your watch,

06:35.748 --> 06:38.382
letting us all know
that we're wasting your time.

06:38.418 --> 06:41.285
I'm sorry. I genuinely am.

06:41.321 --> 06:42.720
I wish I had time to worry

06:42.755 --> 06:45.589
about Jerry and the cocktail bar,

06:45.625 --> 06:46.891
but I got other problems.

06:46.926 --> 06:48.159
Like?

06:48.194 --> 06:50.961
Like a trial that starts tomorrow.

06:50.997 --> 06:53.464
I-I'm not fighting
some parking ticket here.

06:53.499 --> 06:55.399
I'm fighting to preserve my reputation,

06:55.435 --> 06:57.501
my clinic,

06:57.537 --> 06:59.737
all the people I employ there.

06:59.772 --> 07:01.639
I mean, if these
trumped up charges stick...

07:01.674 --> 07:04.308
Trumped up, huh? So, I'm guessing

07:04.344 --> 07:06.322
you had nothing to do
with bringing it on yourself.

07:06.346 --> 07:07.345
Is that right?

07:07.380 --> 07:09.146
Can we not?

07:09.182 --> 07:10.614
I need to win this court case

07:10.650 --> 07:12.850
so I can clear away the mess of my life

07:12.885 --> 07:16.420
and start fresh.

07:16.456 --> 07:17.922
Well, my cab is waiting,

07:17.957 --> 07:21.492
so if you wouldn't mind signing my form.

07:27.567 --> 07:30.501
- Are you married?
- I was married for 26 years.

07:30.536 --> 07:32.036
Now I'm divorced.

07:32.071 --> 07:34.805
Potential Juror number
11, before your divorce,

07:34.841 --> 07:36.207
did you and your husband ever seek

07:36.242 --> 07:39.043
any kind of counseling or therapy?

07:39.078 --> 07:40.277
Yes, we did.

07:40.313 --> 07:43.047
Have you ever heard of the defendants?

07:43.082 --> 07:46.117
Only that they wrote a smutty book.

07:47.920 --> 07:50.454
Your honor, the defense moves
to dismiss Juror number 11

07:50.490 --> 07:51.822
"for cause."

07:51.858 --> 07:53.157
I haven't read the book,

07:53.192 --> 07:54.658
but I did read their excellent paper

07:54.694 --> 07:56.560
on "Sex and the Aging Female" last year.

07:56.596 --> 07:58.162
Your Honor, the prosecution moves

07:58.197 --> 08:00.898
to dismiss potential Juror
number 22 "for cause."

08:00.933 --> 08:02.878
Do you have strong opinions
about people who engage

08:02.902 --> 08:05.970
in sexual activities beyond the
standard missionary position?

08:06.005 --> 08:07.383
How do you feel about a
woman who marries someone

08:07.407 --> 08:09.039
for financial support?

08:09.075 --> 08:10.552
- Do you believe in evolution?
- What is your opinion

08:10.576 --> 08:12.543
of people who have sex
outside of marriage?

08:12.578 --> 08:14.089
If you were the last
hold-out on the jury,

08:14.113 --> 08:16.313
but you believed the defendants
to be innocent...

08:16.349 --> 08:18.416
And if I prove my case
beyond a reasonable doubt...

08:18.451 --> 08:19.595
...would you surrender your beliefs,

08:19.619 --> 08:20.751
or would you hold fast?

08:20.787 --> 08:22.186
...what will your verdict be?

08:22.221 --> 08:23.354
- Guilty.
- Guilty.

08:23.389 --> 08:24.989
Guilty.

08:25.024 --> 08:26.435
We shouldn't have gone with the man

08:26.459 --> 08:28.070
in the sweater
vest... That was a mistake.

08:28.094 --> 08:29.671
How many juries have you picked, Bill?

08:29.695 --> 08:31.039
Because I've picked plenty.
And every time

08:31.063 --> 08:32.730
you tug on my sleeve
or whisper in my ear,

08:32.765 --> 08:34.498
all you do is signal to the courtroom

08:34.534 --> 08:35.677
that you don't trust your lawyer.

08:35.701 --> 08:36.745
I didn't mean to undermine you.

08:36.769 --> 08:38.202
What I don't understand is

08:38.236 --> 08:40.236
why we aren't talking about settling.

08:40.273 --> 08:42.706
If there are no guarantees,
why roll the dice?

08:42.741 --> 08:44.107
Settling makes the most sense.

08:44.143 --> 08:46.710
You want to plead guilty
to sexual deviance?

08:46.746 --> 08:48.090
Because I'm telling you, the prosecution

08:48.114 --> 08:49.580
will stop at nothing short of that,

08:49.615 --> 08:52.349
and that is a plea that will
scare your clients away.

08:52.385 --> 08:55.052
We are in the exact same
position if we lose.

08:55.087 --> 08:57.021
I disagree. A loss won't be a defeat.

08:57.056 --> 08:58.689
It'll only be a temporary setback.

08:58.724 --> 08:59.957
Temporary?

08:59.992 --> 09:02.059
We appeal, again
and again if we have to,

09:02.094 --> 09:03.594
each time to a higher court.

09:03.629 --> 09:05.930
Which could actually be
preferable to an outright win.

09:05.965 --> 09:08.532
A long, drawn-out case?
How is that preferable?

09:08.568 --> 09:10.301
We take it to the national stage.

09:10.336 --> 09:12.970
We defend the cause
of scientific inquiry.

09:13.005 --> 09:15.139
This thing could go all the way.

09:15.174 --> 09:18.075
All the... all the way
to the Supreme Court?

09:18.110 --> 09:20.144
This isn't about some indiscretion

09:20.179 --> 09:21.779
in an exam room.

09:21.814 --> 09:24.815
This is about the right of
scientists to pursue knowledge.

09:24.851 --> 09:26.728
Okay. I'd like to review
your opening statement.

09:26.752 --> 09:27.985
Come on, Bill.

09:28.020 --> 09:29.665
Not to find fault. I
just want to make sure

09:29.689 --> 09:31.121
that you have accurately explained

09:31.157 --> 09:32.957
the precise nature of our work.

09:32.992 --> 09:35.392
If you're gonna argue that we
were acting as scientists,

09:35.428 --> 09:36.839
then you'd better
have the science right.

09:36.863 --> 09:38.696
I'm still drafting it.

09:40.766 --> 09:42.333
Understood. Um...

09:42.368 --> 09:43.801
Excuse me.

09:46.439 --> 09:48.305
Good of her to come. Always helpful

09:48.341 --> 09:50.319
to have the supportive wife
sitting in the gallery.

09:50.343 --> 09:52.476
On the way to being ex-wife.

09:52.512 --> 09:56.113
Let's hope the jury doesn't
find out she filed for divorce.

09:56.148 --> 09:57.648
Well, I hear they put that on hold.

09:57.683 --> 10:01.352
I gather there's been
some kind of... thaw.

10:01.387 --> 10:03.287
I'll see you tomorrow, bright and early.

10:07.660 --> 10:09.593
The husband's a real philanderer,

10:09.629 --> 10:12.096
and the wife's dyspareunia presents

10:12.131 --> 10:13.864
as almost completely psychosomatic.

10:13.900 --> 10:17.801
It did not begin until she
discovered her husband...

10:17.837 --> 10:20.604
T-there's... something,

10:20.640 --> 10:22.172
b-before we go up there,

10:22.208 --> 10:24.475
that I need to tell you.

10:24.510 --> 10:26.443
W...

10:28.481 --> 10:30.047
What is it?

10:30.082 --> 10:32.650
I get the feeling
someone's been listening in

10:32.685 --> 10:34.051
on our conversations.

10:34.086 --> 10:36.120
What do you mean?

10:36.155 --> 10:38.355
A-a few of the things I've said to you

10:38.391 --> 10:39.657
behind closed doors

10:39.692 --> 10:42.226
have... been repeated back to me.

10:42.261 --> 10:43.827
By whom?

10:43.863 --> 10:44.862
Virginia.

10:44.897 --> 10:46.196
What? What kinds of things?

10:46.232 --> 10:49.366
What have we said
that would concern her?

10:49.402 --> 10:51.035
She... you know,

10:51.070 --> 10:52.881
just seemed aware of some
discussions we've had

10:52.905 --> 10:54.805
about clients, assessments,

10:54.840 --> 10:57.408
things she couldn't have known
unless someone had overheard.

10:57.443 --> 11:01.045
I... What, Betty? Lester?
You think they're listening?

11:01.080 --> 11:03.414
All I'm saying is we should be aware.

11:03.449 --> 11:06.850
Of what? That we're...
we're working in an environment

11:06.886 --> 11:08.485
where two people... Two colleagues...

11:08.521 --> 11:10.521
Cannot confer in private?
You're okay with that?

11:10.556 --> 11:12.022
Just... just forget it.

11:12.058 --> 11:13.657
I didn't say this to get you worked up.

11:13.693 --> 11:15.025
I will not forget it.

11:16.963 --> 11:18.429
I'm gonna find out what's going on.

11:18.464 --> 11:20.598
This isn't the Soviet Union.

11:27.873 --> 11:29.673
Mom, come on! You're gonna miss it.

11:29.709 --> 11:31.108
Why does she take so long?

11:31.143 --> 11:32.583
You know how she is with the curlers

11:32.612 --> 11:34.211
and the tweezers and the lotions.

11:34.246 --> 11:35.779
The boat's leaving now.

11:35.815 --> 11:38.916
If the boat's leaving
now, why am I hurrying?

11:38.951 --> 11:42.186
Because our future's written
in pencil, not in ink, Ma.

11:42.221 --> 11:43.765
Are you sure you don't
want us to stay home?

11:43.789 --> 11:45.623
No. I want you to leave and have fun.

11:45.658 --> 11:47.791
You've done too much already.

11:47.827 --> 11:49.727
Oh, uh... hi!

11:49.762 --> 11:51.228
Uh...

11:51.263 --> 11:52.796
Excuse me, um...

11:52.832 --> 11:53.797
I didn't know.

11:53.833 --> 11:54.665
Hello?

11:56.135 --> 11:57.601
Mom, Dad, you know Betty.

11:57.637 --> 12:00.971
Betty lives down the hall.

12:01.007 --> 12:05.075
I water the plants when she's away.

12:05.111 --> 12:06.443
But you're not away.

12:08.481 --> 12:11.615
I got mixed up. I thought that...

12:11.651 --> 12:14.084
you were going to visit your parents.

12:14.120 --> 12:18.322
Oh, no. Yeah, no, I...
Uh, they came to visit me, so...

12:18.357 --> 12:22.226
But they're, uh, going on a
gambling cruise this morning.

12:22.261 --> 12:23.394
Yes.

12:23.429 --> 12:25.295
That... sounds fun.

12:25.331 --> 12:27.531
Yes.

12:30.302 --> 12:33.270
Well, um, it was nice to meet you.

12:33.305 --> 12:35.506
- Nice to meet you too.
- Nice to meet you.

12:40.146 --> 12:42.813
Yes. We can confirm
the 2:00 appointment.

12:44.150 --> 12:46.150
Great. Thank you very much.

12:46.185 --> 12:47.518
Bye.

12:47.553 --> 12:49.953
Good morning.

12:52.024 --> 12:53.857
I, uh, spotted some backlogged
dictations,

12:53.893 --> 12:55.426
so I've been transcribing them.

12:55.461 --> 12:58.529
Uh, here is the updated Devlin
file for this afternoon.

12:58.564 --> 13:00.197
Thank you.

13:01.233 --> 13:04.134
Dr. Virginia, before you go...

13:04.170 --> 13:06.937
I've been reading your book
looking over the files.

13:06.972 --> 13:10.340
There is a revolution going on here.

13:10.376 --> 13:12.042
The problems that you treat,

13:12.078 --> 13:16.213
the way that you treat them
without mocking or judgment...

13:16.248 --> 13:18.816
I have to say...

13:18.851 --> 13:21.051
Please let me say...

13:21.087 --> 13:24.521
I could not be prouder
to be here helping you.

13:24.557 --> 13:26.690
Thank you for giving me this job.

13:28.994 --> 13:30.694
Uh, well, thank you.

13:31.997 --> 13:34.364
Oh! Duty calls.

13:36.869 --> 13:39.470
Reproductive Biology
Research Foundation.

13:39.505 --> 13:41.805
Uh, have you looked into Guy?

13:41.841 --> 13:42.639
Ghee?

13:42.675 --> 13:44.208
The guy that you hired.

13:44.243 --> 13:45.709
His name is Ghee,

13:45.745 --> 13:47.511
and yes, I've called his references.

13:47.546 --> 13:48.879
They all gave glowing reviews.

13:48.914 --> 13:50.814
But have you done a background check?

13:50.850 --> 13:51.993
I want to make sure that we know

13:52.017 --> 13:53.717
everything we need to know about him,

13:53.753 --> 13:55.986
why he's so keen to be working here.

13:56.021 --> 13:58.088
You don't think that's a tad paranoid?

13:58.124 --> 14:00.524
Betty, we're in the middle
of a criminal trial,

14:00.559 --> 14:02.359
thanks to our last eager recruit.

14:02.394 --> 14:03.994
Fine. I'll do more digging.

14:04.029 --> 14:05.796
In the meantime...

14:14.373 --> 14:15.839
The outline for the new book.

14:15.875 --> 14:18.609
May it rest in peace.

14:18.644 --> 14:21.345
The note says Little Brown
is returning the material

14:21.380 --> 14:25.048
since they've passed on publishing.

14:31.657 --> 14:34.124
Call Bob Drag at Little Brown.

14:34.160 --> 14:36.226
Make an appointment for this afternoon.

14:36.262 --> 14:38.061
- In New York?
- Book two plane tickets.

14:38.097 --> 14:39.897
And don't let Drag make any excuses.

14:39.932 --> 14:42.499
Tell him Bill and I are
only in town for a few hours.

14:47.506 --> 14:51.241
Oh, God, I hope Keller's a better lawyer

14:51.310 --> 14:52.476
than he is a speller.

14:52.511 --> 14:54.578
Little Brown has dropped us.

14:54.613 --> 14:56.213
Well, they dropped us weeks ago

14:56.248 --> 14:57.726
when we didn't show up
for the press conference.

14:57.750 --> 14:59.416
I mean officially.

14:59.451 --> 15:02.152
They've sent back the outline
and sample chapters.

15:02.188 --> 15:04.321
Oh. That's very considerate of them.

15:04.356 --> 15:05.834
They could've just
thrown them in the trash.

15:05.858 --> 15:07.402
Bill, I don't think that we should wait

15:07.426 --> 15:08.892
for the court case to be resolved

15:08.928 --> 15:10.138
before trying to revive Little Brown's

15:10.162 --> 15:11.662
interest in the book.

15:11.697 --> 15:14.131
Why not reinvest them now?
That way they can capitalize

15:14.166 --> 15:16.099
on any publicity that the case garners.

15:16.135 --> 15:17.901
- I'm sorry. Now?
- If we wait for a verdict

15:17.937 --> 15:19.336
and it's unfavorable,

15:19.371 --> 15:20.971
we'll look like we're scrambling.

15:21.006 --> 15:23.473
Before a verdict, we can
better position ourselves.

15:23.509 --> 15:25.843
Fine. So call Bob Drag

15:25.878 --> 15:28.579
and tell him we have
a world-class attorney

15:28.614 --> 15:32.115
who apparently never learned
"I before E except after C,"

15:32.151 --> 15:34.151
and tell him that, one way or another,

15:34.186 --> 15:35.953
we will emerge victorious.

15:35.988 --> 15:38.021
I say that we do one better

15:38.057 --> 15:39.590
and we go to New York

15:39.625 --> 15:42.292
and we tell him that in person.

15:42.328 --> 15:45.262
But we... we're in
the middle of a trial.

15:45.297 --> 15:48.665
And besides, the publisher
is your purview.

15:48.701 --> 15:50.212
Yes, but we'll make a much better case

15:50.236 --> 15:52.469
that Masters & Johnson are back on track

15:52.504 --> 15:55.806
if both Masters and Johnson
are in that room.

15:55.841 --> 15:58.108
Together.

15:58.143 --> 16:01.712
I've already asked Betty
to book the first flight.

16:04.049 --> 16:07.184
You just... assumed I'd go?

16:08.754 --> 16:10.721
I... hoped.

16:15.194 --> 16:17.794
There... there's no way. I
have to review this statement,

16:17.830 --> 16:19.830
and, uh, I'm working
on a list of questions

16:19.865 --> 16:21.732
for the prosecution's witnesses.

16:21.767 --> 16:23.812
You really don't think that
Keller's got that covered?

16:23.836 --> 16:25.502
What if he doesn't?

16:25.537 --> 16:28.538
You know, he may have dazzled
you with his Supreme Court talk,

16:28.574 --> 16:31.808
but... you know,
appeal could take years.

16:31.844 --> 16:34.811
This has been hanging
over my head long enough.

16:34.847 --> 16:36.546
A win would mean a fresh start.

16:36.582 --> 16:38.348
Fresh start? That's what you want?

16:38.384 --> 16:40.584
- Mm-hm. - Seems to
me that you've been

16:40.619 --> 16:43.086
backsliding, more than anything.

16:45.291 --> 16:48.592
The other morning when I
dropped off Libby's coat,

16:48.627 --> 16:52.763
it seemed that you and she... You two...

16:52.798 --> 16:54.865
Libby and I are considering reconciling.

16:58.037 --> 17:01.238
Well, that's... curious.

17:02.808 --> 17:05.675
Can I ask why? What's changed?

17:05.711 --> 17:08.578
Why would things be different
between the two of you now?

17:08.614 --> 17:11.580
Well, we're gonna work
to make things different.

17:11.617 --> 17:13.349
Do you remember what you said to me

17:13.385 --> 17:17.721
when I was considering getting
back together with George?

17:17.756 --> 17:22.459
You asked me why I would want
to make the same mistake twice.

17:23.796 --> 17:25.796
And you were right.

17:27.598 --> 17:29.066
There was nothing between us

17:29.101 --> 17:33.670
but a familiar old pattern.

17:35.674 --> 17:39.242
Trust me, Bill.
Falling into old patterns...

17:39.278 --> 17:42.112
can be dangerous.

17:42.147 --> 17:43.780
Dangerous.

17:45.284 --> 17:47.017
You want a fresh start?

17:50.022 --> 17:51.655
Then come to New York.

17:54.660 --> 17:57.394
We can... both reinvest

17:57.429 --> 18:01.598
in what has always given
us the most satisfaction...

18:03.769 --> 18:05.602
The work.

18:11.477 --> 18:13.844
I'm gonna put my focus
where it belongs, on...

18:13.879 --> 18:15.412
On the court case.

18:15.447 --> 18:16.947
But I think you're right.

18:16.982 --> 18:21.151
You... you should focus on
reviving interest in the book.

18:21.186 --> 18:24.354
And I'm sure you'll be
up to that task without me.

18:51.917 --> 18:54.818
I don't need prepping,
because I'm not testifying.

18:54.853 --> 18:56.787
And I'm not so stupid
that I would reveal

18:56.822 --> 18:58.488
Bill's and my situation.

18:58.524 --> 18:59.873
He's the father of my children.

18:59.977 --> 19:01.503
I don't want him to end up in jail.

19:01.527 --> 19:03.293
All right. But the press will accost you

19:03.328 --> 19:05.529
on the courthouse steps,
try to get you to say things.

19:05.564 --> 19:07.397
You can't hide from the cameras.

19:07.433 --> 19:10.000
They'd rather catch you running
away than standing still.

19:10.035 --> 19:12.335
I have no intention of
running, Mr. Keller.

19:12.371 --> 19:13.804
I seem to remember a party

19:13.839 --> 19:16.073
where I was left holding a plaid cape.

19:16.108 --> 19:17.340
Are we through, then?

19:17.376 --> 19:19.743
Not quite.

19:19.778 --> 19:24.014
So, some reporter focuses a
camera on your gorgeous face:

19:24.049 --> 19:26.716
"Mrs. Masters, your husband is charged

19:26.752 --> 19:29.886
with pandering and prostitution."

19:29.922 --> 19:31.421
What do you say?

19:31.457 --> 19:35.525
This case was trumped up
by an overzealous prosecution

19:35.561 --> 19:38.862
bent on destroying my husband's
years of scientific work.

19:38.897 --> 19:41.364
I am very proud of what
my husband has accomplished

19:41.400 --> 19:43.867
and of his contributions to science.

19:43.902 --> 19:45.202
- Oh, my goodness.
- You know,

19:45.237 --> 19:46.614
I'm beginning to believe
this whole thing

19:46.638 --> 19:48.516
was just an excuse to make
me sit down with you.

19:48.540 --> 19:50.718
And my fancy footwork in the
courtroom didn't impress you?

19:50.742 --> 19:53.376
- I could see you watching me.
- We are done here.

19:53.412 --> 19:55.390
How about a drink? Come on.
It's five o'clock somewhere.

19:55.414 --> 19:58.381
I know a great little jazz club
just a couple blocks away.

19:58.417 --> 19:59.816
What do you say?

20:02.621 --> 20:04.955
I'm very proud of my husband's
accomplishments

20:04.990 --> 20:06.923
and his contribution to science.

20:10.129 --> 20:11.795
He's definitely the spy. He's the one

20:11.830 --> 20:13.763
that took the photo of us
and showed it to Bill.

20:13.799 --> 20:15.210
Yeah, but not before
he showed it to you,

20:15.234 --> 20:16.766
which means he's not a snitch.

20:16.802 --> 20:19.302
Well, we'll see what he says
when we confront him.

20:19.338 --> 20:20.815
Reproductive Biology
Research Foundation.

20:20.839 --> 20:22.072
Lester?

20:22.107 --> 20:23.573
Yes, and who am I speaking with?

20:23.609 --> 20:24.819
Okay, he's not here. Let's come back.

20:24.843 --> 20:26.109
Lester?

20:30.983 --> 20:32.082
Look at this.

20:34.286 --> 20:36.753
No, I'm sorry. The whole
morning is completely full.

20:36.788 --> 20:38.622
But I can give you a noon appointment.

20:38.657 --> 20:41.424
That's the earliest that I have.

20:41.460 --> 20:42.637
Or we could try for the next day.

20:42.661 --> 20:45.228
I have a, uh, 2:30.

20:45.264 --> 20:46.830
They've got the whole place wired.

20:46.865 --> 20:50.267
Labeled and
organized by room, date, time.

20:50.302 --> 20:52.435
Why? If they were taping us to train us,

20:52.471 --> 20:54.070
wouldn't they tell us?

20:54.106 --> 20:55.650
It's like they want
to catch us at something.

20:55.674 --> 20:57.841
You might expect this
if there'd been complaints

20:57.876 --> 21:01.178
or if we'd been
foisted upon her by a superior.

21:01.213 --> 21:03.079
You think Virginia is behind this?

21:03.115 --> 21:06.516
God, to think how many offers I had...

21:06.552 --> 21:09.286
Boston Lying-In, UCLA,
Columbia Presbyterian.

21:09.321 --> 21:11.121
I gave them all up to be treated

21:11.156 --> 21:13.456
like an untrustworthy
incompetent by a woman

21:13.492 --> 21:14.991
- who isn't even a doctor!
- Shh, shh.

21:16.962 --> 21:18.662
We cannot stay here, Art.

21:18.697 --> 21:20.041
How will it look to a potential employer

21:20.065 --> 21:21.765
if we jump ship not even two months in?

21:21.800 --> 21:23.500
I don't care how it looks.

21:23.535 --> 21:25.302
I'm surprised that you do.

21:25.337 --> 21:26.948
Or maybe I'm not. You spent
the night together.

21:26.972 --> 21:28.972
She's worked her many charms on you.

21:29.007 --> 21:33.009
Look. I'm just trying to imagine
things from their point of view.

21:33.045 --> 21:35.156
I think they're letting us in
on a process that, until now,

21:35.180 --> 21:36.980
has only involved the two of them...

21:37.015 --> 21:39.216
That's gotta be difficult.

21:41.520 --> 21:43.486
If it doesn't get better, we leave.

21:44.890 --> 21:46.089
Okay.

21:51.830 --> 21:53.230
Mr. Drag?

21:54.366 --> 21:55.732
How was your flight?

21:55.767 --> 21:57.968
Uneventful. There was some turbulence...

21:58.003 --> 21:59.069
I wasn't really asking.

21:59.104 --> 22:00.415
I was being what we call "polite."

22:00.439 --> 22:01.638
It's a concept that may be

22:01.673 --> 22:03.373
somewhat foreign to you, Mrs. Johnson.

22:03.408 --> 22:05.048
You see, showing up at
my office like this

22:05.077 --> 22:07.877
after I made it
absolutely clear to your secretary

22:07.913 --> 22:09.646
that I wasn't available this afternoon

22:09.681 --> 22:11.815
would be what we call "impolite."

22:11.850 --> 22:13.516
I understand.

22:13.552 --> 22:16.353
Though I worried that it
would be more impolite

22:16.388 --> 22:18.032
to not at least stop by
and say hello when I was

22:18.056 --> 22:20.323
just around the corner
meeting with Simon & Schuster.

22:20.359 --> 22:22.726
They're so excited about
Human Sexual Inadequacy.

22:22.761 --> 22:24.861
The keep saying it's
gonna be another best-seller.

22:24.896 --> 22:27.397
Did you meet with Mr.
Simon or Mr. Schuster?

22:27.432 --> 22:30.567
Bob Simon has been dead for ten years,

22:30.602 --> 22:32.669
but nice try.

22:32.704 --> 22:36.239
The point is Bill and I
are very loyal to you,

22:36.275 --> 22:38.875
especially after everything
we put you through in St. Louis.

22:38.910 --> 22:41.778
Don't. The two of you
have been nothing but trouble,

22:41.813 --> 22:44.347
and the last thing I need is trouble.

22:44.383 --> 22:45.882
Did you change offices?

22:45.917 --> 22:47.550
Didn't your office used to be upstairs?

22:47.586 --> 22:49.731
Excuse me, please. I'm
gonna be late for a launch party.

22:49.755 --> 22:52.122
Oh, well, why don't we
meet up after the party?

22:52.157 --> 22:54.724
I haven't even begun to tell you
about the new work we're doing:

22:54.760 --> 22:56.359
fetishes, deviance.

22:56.395 --> 22:58.094
We treated a man a couple of weeks ago

22:58.130 --> 23:00.463
with a predilection
for his wife's high heels.

23:00.499 --> 23:02.132
- Wearing them?
- Copulating with them.

23:02.167 --> 23:06.369
He'll make a compelling
case study for the new book.

23:06.405 --> 23:08.238
What?

23:08.273 --> 23:09.773
Too bad you're wearing that.

23:09.808 --> 23:13.276
I'd take you to the party,
but it's black tie.

23:13.312 --> 23:15.912
Isn't Saks just around the corner?

23:17.082 --> 23:18.982
How'd it go?

23:19.017 --> 23:22.719
Well, I think they're
all down for the count.

23:22.754 --> 23:26.656
And Johnny snores now,
which is kind of odd.

23:30.996 --> 23:32.495
Uh... what are you doing?

23:32.531 --> 23:33.741
A woman in my group gives them away

23:33.765 --> 23:35.732
in exchange for frozen casseroles.

23:35.767 --> 23:36.900
She hates to cook.

23:36.935 --> 23:38.068
Want some?

23:38.103 --> 23:40.003
No.

23:40.038 --> 23:42.038
I'll take a drink, though,
if you're pouring.

23:44.109 --> 23:45.475
I noticed on Saturday

23:45.510 --> 23:46.943
that the back porch light was out.

23:46.978 --> 23:48.144
I thought I'd fix it.

23:48.180 --> 23:49.279
Fixed it myself.

23:51.350 --> 23:52.816
You found the right screwdriver?

23:52.851 --> 23:54.918
I'm not helpless, Bill.

23:54.953 --> 23:56.186
Uh...

23:56.221 --> 23:57.687
what about the disposal?

23:57.723 --> 23:59.189
It's fine.

24:00.392 --> 24:01.858
Bill, if there's anything broken,

24:01.893 --> 24:03.393
I will let you know.

24:06.498 --> 24:07.997
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

24:11.737 --> 24:14.371
How about us?

24:14.406 --> 24:18.007
Can I fix us?

24:18.043 --> 24:21.378
Those, uh, three wishes of
yours were a good start.

24:21.413 --> 24:23.847
Don't you think?

24:23.882 --> 24:26.116
Maybe you could

24:26.151 --> 24:28.385
think of a few more items
to add to the list,

24:28.420 --> 24:32.021
and I could check them off one by one.

24:32.057 --> 24:33.056
Hmm.

24:33.091 --> 24:34.691
Seemed to work the other night.

24:34.726 --> 24:36.459
I think the other night is proof

24:36.495 --> 24:40.196
that neither of us quite knows
how a separation works.

24:40.232 --> 24:41.965
Is that a bad thing?

24:42.000 --> 24:43.967
I guess not.

24:44.002 --> 24:46.770
We're just in uncharted waters.

24:51.042 --> 24:55.044
- So, these, um...
- these uncharted waters...

24:57.349 --> 24:59.749
Is there any chance of

24:59.785 --> 25:02.018
what happened the
other night happening again?

25:04.556 --> 25:06.489
Or...

25:06.525 --> 25:11.494
we could experiment a little.

25:11.530 --> 25:13.830
What we did the other night...
I gather that there's a way

25:13.865 --> 25:17.934
that we can do it to each other

25:17.969 --> 25:19.335
at the same time.

25:19.371 --> 25:21.604
I believe there's even

25:21.640 --> 25:24.174
a number for it.

25:30.415 --> 25:34.250
I cannot apologize enough
for what happened in St. Louis.

25:34.286 --> 25:36.119
The way Bill and I left you hanging

25:36.154 --> 25:37.387
with all those reporters.

25:37.422 --> 25:38.521
It was just, well...

25:38.557 --> 25:40.123
Don't make me relive it.

25:40.158 --> 25:41.736
Well, the good news is
we're back on our feet,

25:41.760 --> 25:43.059
and we're days away from having

25:43.094 --> 25:44.861
this whole trial business behind us.

25:44.896 --> 25:47.297
A white wine, please,
and for the lady...

25:47.332 --> 25:48.598
A white wine as well.

25:50.302 --> 25:53.369
Our lawyer, Bram Keller...
He thinks that this trial could

25:53.405 --> 25:54.804
be as important as Scopes.

25:54.840 --> 25:56.105
Didn't Scopes lose?

25:56.141 --> 25:58.408
He did. Yes. But we won't.

25:58.443 --> 26:01.544
And even if we do, Keller
assures us that any outcome

26:01.613 --> 26:02.812
works to our advantage.

26:02.848 --> 26:04.948
If we win, great. If we lose, we appeal.

26:04.983 --> 26:06.093
We become a cause celeb.

26:06.117 --> 26:08.251
- Hello, Arnold.
- Bob.

26:08.286 --> 26:11.454
Arnold, I'd like to introduce
you to Virginia Johnson,

26:11.490 --> 26:13.823
of Masters & Johnson.

26:13.859 --> 26:15.058
Arnold Ketterman.

26:15.093 --> 26:16.793
Arnold runs things around here.

26:16.828 --> 26:18.394
Oh, it's a real pleasure.

26:18.430 --> 26:21.264
Virginia and I go way back.

26:21.299 --> 26:22.799
Is that right?

26:24.436 --> 26:25.668
'Scuse me.

26:26.605 --> 26:28.471
What was that?

26:28.507 --> 26:30.073
What?

26:30.108 --> 26:33.009
Another white wine, pronto.

26:38.650 --> 26:40.817
I believe what we just did...

26:40.852 --> 26:43.953
violates section 1-1, subsection 010,

26:43.989 --> 26:46.089
of the Missouri criminal code.

26:49.194 --> 26:50.994
Don't worry. I won't
bring it up in court.

26:51.029 --> 26:53.663
In court?

26:53.698 --> 26:56.332
Keller's not gonna put
you on the stand, is he?

26:56.368 --> 26:59.502
Section 546, subsection 260,

26:59.538 --> 27:01.838
of the Missouri Revised Statutes:

27:01.873 --> 27:04.774
"a wife cannot be forced to
testify against her husband."

27:04.809 --> 27:06.175
How are you smoking that stuff

27:06.211 --> 27:08.311
and still managing to recite legal code?

27:08.346 --> 27:10.046
You tell me.

27:10.081 --> 27:12.482
- Here. Try it.
- No. I'm fine.

27:12.517 --> 27:14.884
Oh, come on, Bill.
You're a research scientist.

27:14.920 --> 27:16.653
Aren't you a little bit curious?

27:16.688 --> 27:18.621
All right. One puff.

27:18.657 --> 27:20.356
I believe they call it a hit.

27:22.661 --> 27:24.427
Do they?

27:28.533 --> 27:30.833
Oh!

27:32.404 --> 27:34.871
God, it smells like a wrestling mat.

27:36.207 --> 27:39.042
- Ohh... this bed is great.
- Mm.

27:39.077 --> 27:40.710
When did you get it?

27:40.745 --> 27:43.580
There was a Sears across the
street from the Salvation Army.

27:43.615 --> 27:47.016
I went there right after I
gave away all your clothes.

27:47.052 --> 27:48.551
The woman there didn't even blink,

27:48.587 --> 27:50.053
she'd seen it so many times.

27:50.088 --> 27:52.188
Well, you were right to do it.

27:52.223 --> 27:53.690
- The clothes?
- No, the bed.

27:53.725 --> 27:55.258
It's great.

27:55.293 --> 27:57.660
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

27:59.598 --> 28:01.664
Ah.

28:01.700 --> 28:04.100
So, come on. What else should
we have done differently, Lib?

28:04.135 --> 28:05.768
- Hon...
- Oh, the sex. I know.

28:05.804 --> 28:08.338
I know. But what else besides that?

28:08.373 --> 28:10.707
Come on, Bill. We're having a nice time.

28:10.742 --> 28:14.110
Let's not drudge up
the list of grievances.

28:14.145 --> 28:16.045
Well, now's your chance.

28:16.081 --> 28:18.648
I can't promise I'll always
be this open to hearing them.

28:19.718 --> 28:21.417
Fine. Fine.

28:22.420 --> 28:24.454
We should've had friends.

28:24.489 --> 28:26.522
- We had friends.
- No. Real friends.

28:26.558 --> 28:29.292
Not just Virginia.

28:29.327 --> 28:33.029
You know, other couples
and... and neighbors.

28:33.064 --> 28:36.933
We should've had dinner
parties and played music,

28:36.968 --> 28:38.601
played charades.

28:40.972 --> 28:43.306
Three words.

28:43.341 --> 28:45.975
First word.

28:46.011 --> 28:46.809
You.

28:46.845 --> 28:48.678
Mm. Second word.

28:51.282 --> 28:53.049
Sounds like.

28:53.084 --> 28:54.217
Eat.

28:54.252 --> 28:56.319
Sounds like "eat."

28:56.354 --> 28:57.887
Back. Eat back.

28:57.922 --> 28:58.955
Past tense.

28:58.990 --> 29:00.790
Ate. Sounds like "ate"!

29:00.825 --> 29:03.326
Rate. Mate. Hate.

29:03.361 --> 29:04.994
Hate. You hate...

29:05.030 --> 29:06.062
I hate charades.

29:08.633 --> 29:10.166
No, you're right. You're right.

29:10.201 --> 29:12.268
I should've tried harder
to meet new people.

29:13.972 --> 29:15.138
I never enjoyed it.

29:15.173 --> 29:17.306
I don't understand that.

29:17.342 --> 29:19.409
Well...

29:19.444 --> 29:22.912
I don't know, I...

29:22.947 --> 29:24.847
I'm always afraid people won't like me.

29:24.883 --> 29:26.582
- Why?
- Because...

29:26.618 --> 29:27.850
people don't like me.

29:30.455 --> 29:32.422
Oh, we should've had more fun.

29:32.457 --> 29:33.790
We should've travelled more.

29:33.825 --> 29:34.957
We travelled.

29:34.993 --> 29:37.660
Oh, not just to medical conventions.

29:37.696 --> 29:40.963
We should've taken the
kids to Disneyland.

29:40.999 --> 29:42.799
You wanted to go to Disneyland?

29:42.834 --> 29:44.200
Why didn't you say?

29:44.235 --> 29:48.638
Bill Masters on the spinning teacups?

29:48.673 --> 29:49.939
Isn't that what we just did?

29:49.974 --> 29:52.041
Mmm, I believe they also have a ride

29:52.077 --> 29:54.377
called the Carousel of Progress.

29:54.412 --> 29:56.345
- Progress?
- Mm.

29:56.381 --> 29:58.514
Sounds about right.

29:58.550 --> 30:00.383
You want to go around again?

30:04.155 --> 30:05.988
Mommy.

30:06.024 --> 30:08.658
Honey, did you have a bad dream?

30:08.693 --> 30:11.828
I'm so sorry. Let's go get you
a snack and tell a story.

30:13.198 --> 30:14.731
What was it? The monsters again?

30:14.766 --> 30:16.032
- Yeah.
- Aww.

30:16.067 --> 30:17.834
The whole novel is narrated

30:17.869 --> 30:19.402
by a guy who's being held captive

30:19.437 --> 30:21.003
on a planet called Tralfamadore.

30:21.039 --> 30:22.071
- Ah.
- He's on exhibit

30:22.107 --> 30:23.840
in some kind of alien zoo

30:23.875 --> 30:25.842
where aliens come to study him.

30:25.877 --> 30:27.910
He's this crazy, traumatized ex-soldier

30:27.946 --> 30:29.846
Slaughterhouse-Five, you say?

30:29.881 --> 30:31.748
I will make sure to pick up a copy.

30:31.783 --> 30:33.883
Will you excuse us just for a moment?

30:33.918 --> 30:35.229
Bob, if this is your way of saying

30:35.253 --> 30:36.397
that I need to sleep with you

30:36.421 --> 30:37.887
to get the book published...

30:37.922 --> 30:39.700
Oh, please. I have no interest
in sleeping with you.

30:39.724 --> 30:41.657
Well, you are certainly
behaving like you do.

30:41.693 --> 30:43.259
You're the one that wanted to come.

30:43.294 --> 30:45.928
I wanted to talk about
the sexual inadequacy book,

30:45.964 --> 30:47.029
not act it out.

30:47.065 --> 30:48.175
So you've done your talking.

30:48.199 --> 30:51.400
Go ahead. Leave.

30:51.436 --> 30:54.704
Why are you doing this, Bob?

30:54.739 --> 30:57.373
Perhaps I should just talk to your boss.

30:57.408 --> 30:58.775
Mr. Ketterman, was it?

30:58.810 --> 31:00.688
Because I have a feeling
this little performance

31:00.712 --> 31:02.211
was intended for him.

31:02.247 --> 31:05.014
Don't. You can see
what kind of man he is.

31:05.049 --> 31:07.550
Golf games, fishing trips, hunting.

31:07.585 --> 31:09.886
For some reason, he's
gotten it into his head

31:09.921 --> 31:11.420
that I don't pass muster.

31:11.456 --> 31:14.290
The small office, no secretary...

31:14.325 --> 31:15.758
he's demoted you.

31:15.794 --> 31:17.271
Didn't give me the new Norman Mailer,

31:17.295 --> 31:19.028
which just about broke my heart.

31:19.063 --> 31:22.431
Now I write titillating ad
copy for Jacqueline Suzanne.

31:22.467 --> 31:24.367
- I see.
- It can't be a coincidence

31:24.402 --> 31:28.404
that it happened right after my
fiancée called off our wedding.

31:28.439 --> 31:30.473
I-I'm so sorry to hear that.

31:30.508 --> 31:34.076
I know what Ketterman thinks,
what all of them think.

31:34.112 --> 31:37.814
And I can tell you it's not true.

31:40.919 --> 31:44.921
Either way, Bob,
groping me is not the solution.

31:46.324 --> 31:49.292
This was a bad idea
coming here with me tonight.

31:49.327 --> 31:51.127
Wait. Wait.

31:51.162 --> 31:55.264
Are you familiar with the Latin
phrase, "quid pro quo"?

31:57.635 --> 31:58.935
I'll be honest with you.

31:58.970 --> 32:02.338
I need to take this book
deal back to Bill.

32:02.373 --> 32:04.307
A lot depends on it.

32:06.444 --> 32:08.978
So that's the quid.

32:09.013 --> 32:11.380
What's the quo?

32:14.686 --> 32:15.651
Mm-mm.

32:15.687 --> 32:17.119
Have a little.

32:17.155 --> 32:18.599
You know if you
don't eat them, I'm gonna.

32:18.623 --> 32:20.423
Ever since these contractions started,

32:20.458 --> 32:22.091
I feel like the Hindenburg.

32:22.126 --> 32:24.193
You're having contractions?
Why didn't you tell me?

32:24.229 --> 32:25.862
It started this morning. My mother said

32:25.897 --> 32:27.263
it's nothing to worry about.

32:27.298 --> 32:29.131
Your mom, Edith Schiff, MD?

32:29.167 --> 32:30.967
I called Barton too.

32:31.002 --> 32:32.668
He said the same thing.

32:32.704 --> 32:34.303
You should have told me.

32:34.339 --> 32:36.539
Well, you're never around.

32:36.574 --> 32:39.909
And don't say you wish you were. I know.

32:41.179 --> 32:43.112
My mom has been helpful.

32:43.147 --> 32:47.183
She... she...
filled our freezer with food.

32:47.218 --> 32:48.784
And you should see the nursery.

32:48.820 --> 32:51.020
My dad painted it. It's perfect.

32:51.055 --> 32:53.522
I'm glad they're being useful.
They've been here long enough.

32:53.558 --> 32:56.459
Have they booked
their train tickets home?

32:56.494 --> 32:59.996
Well, that's the thing, Bets, um...

33:00.031 --> 33:02.331
I just don't know
how to ask them to leave

33:02.367 --> 33:04.066
before the baby comes.

33:04.102 --> 33:05.668
You use words.

33:05.703 --> 33:07.248
"I want to do this on my
own." That's all you say.

33:07.272 --> 33:08.704
They'll never believe that.

33:08.740 --> 33:10.640
Nobody wants to
have a baby on their own.

33:10.675 --> 33:12.519
You'll make them believe it
or you'll call them and say

33:12.543 --> 33:14.543
that the World Book salesman is coming

33:14.579 --> 33:16.646
and he's being surprisingly supportive.

33:16.681 --> 33:20.983
I don't care what you say.
Just say something.

33:21.019 --> 33:22.985
But I want them to stay.

33:23.021 --> 33:25.588
Oh, God.

33:25.623 --> 33:28.824
Just for a few days. Just
until the baby comes home.

33:28.860 --> 33:30.860
Until it's not a few days.

33:30.895 --> 33:32.662
Until it's a few weeks.

33:32.697 --> 33:34.897
Try to understand, Bets.

33:34.933 --> 33:36.699
You understand.

33:36.734 --> 33:38.501
If I am not at that baby's birth,

33:38.536 --> 33:41.504
then I am gonna be the neighbor
in this baby's life forever...

33:41.539 --> 33:43.839
At his birthday parties,
his piano recitals,

33:43.875 --> 33:45.942
every time your parents are around.

33:45.977 --> 33:49.712
And what about when
he's older? When he can talk?

33:49.747 --> 33:52.515
Are you gonna ask him
to lie about me then?

33:52.550 --> 33:56.953
You have to tell them the truth.

33:56.988 --> 33:59.355
What? That I'm in love...

33:59.390 --> 34:01.223
That I'm in love with a woman?

34:01.259 --> 34:03.125
I can't do that.

34:03.161 --> 34:06.395
It'll surprise 'em.
It might even shock 'em.

34:06.431 --> 34:10.632
But, Hel, they seem like nice people.

34:10.668 --> 34:12.268
It might be okay.

34:12.303 --> 34:15.638
I know them. I know how this story ends.

34:15.672 --> 34:19.442
It ends with me never
seeing them again, and...

34:19.476 --> 34:22.545
And you can't ask me
to never see them again.

34:26.117 --> 34:27.583
Thank you.

34:27.618 --> 34:29.284
I'm glad to catch you alone, Arnold.

34:29.320 --> 34:31.887
I was hoping for a chance
to speak candidly with you.

34:31.956 --> 34:34.056
Uh, I'm sorry. I promised
Updike his gin.

34:34.092 --> 34:39.061
Dr. Masters and I have had a bit
of a situation with Bob Drag.

34:39.097 --> 34:42.398
As you know, our first book,
it was a best-seller,

34:42.433 --> 34:44.900
created a huge
following... So huge, in fact,

34:44.936 --> 34:47.402
Hugh Hefner has just
come on board as an investor...

34:47.438 --> 34:50.773
Mrs. Johnson, is this a...
Is this a sales pitch?

34:50.808 --> 34:53.676
No, no. This is about...
This is about Drag.

34:53.710 --> 34:56.978
I fear that he may have
poisoned the well

34:57.014 --> 34:59.081
here at Little Brown.

34:59.117 --> 35:02.018
Well, it seems to me that you
two did that to yourselves.

35:02.053 --> 35:03.019
Didn't you?

35:03.054 --> 35:04.754
The lawsuit?

35:04.789 --> 35:07.289
No. Bob should have made it
clear that that would have

35:07.325 --> 35:09.925
absolutely no
negative impact on the book.

35:09.961 --> 35:12.795
Bram Keller has taken the case,

35:12.830 --> 35:15.631
and he thinks it could go all
the way to the Supreme court.

35:15.666 --> 35:16.944
We're gonna be on the front page

35:16.968 --> 35:18.701
of every newspaper in the country.

35:18.736 --> 35:21.170
That's free publicity for a book
that you could be publishing

35:21.205 --> 35:22.972
if it weren't for Drag.

35:23.007 --> 35:27.710
Bob Drag is barely hanging on here.

35:27.745 --> 35:29.545
He wouldn't purposely tank a winner.

35:29.580 --> 35:31.280
But he did,

35:31.315 --> 35:34.216
and for the most bizarre, petty reason.

35:34.252 --> 35:36.052
If you even knew the details...

35:36.087 --> 35:39.055
You going to tell me?

35:39.090 --> 35:41.490
I would really rather not.

35:41.526 --> 35:43.359
You're wasting my time.

35:43.394 --> 35:45.494
Okay. All right. I'll tell you.

35:45.530 --> 35:49.498
But you have to promise
to keep it to yourself.

35:49.534 --> 35:52.802
We let Bob participate in
the first round of research

35:52.837 --> 35:54.370
for Human Sexual Response.

35:54.405 --> 35:55.738
Now, before you say anything,

35:55.773 --> 35:57.406
I know it was a conflict of interest.

35:57.442 --> 35:58.407
We shouldn't of done it.

35:58.443 --> 36:01.744
But he was so eager, adamant.

36:01.779 --> 36:03.879
We couldn't say no.

36:03.915 --> 36:05.681
So, you can imagine his fury

36:05.716 --> 36:08.984
when we couldn't include
his data or his case study.

36:09.020 --> 36:11.687
Because he's light in the loafers?

36:11.722 --> 36:13.522
Hardly.

36:13.558 --> 36:16.325
You saw the way that
he was pawing me tonight.

36:16.360 --> 36:19.562
His sexual stamina is off the charts.

36:19.597 --> 36:21.764
Refractory period non-existent.

36:21.799 --> 36:24.433
Including him would've
completely skewed our data.

36:24.469 --> 36:29.738
No wonder his fiancée left him.
Poor girl couldn't keep up.

36:29.774 --> 36:34.777
Bob Drag is one long and large erection.

36:38.049 --> 36:41.517
I don't think he
even saw you. Thank God.

36:41.552 --> 36:43.686
Why would it be so bad if he did see me?

36:43.721 --> 36:46.088
You know, nothing would
make the kids happier

36:46.124 --> 36:47.267
than if we were back together.

36:47.291 --> 36:48.257
Oh, Bill, please.

36:48.292 --> 36:50.459
We could be a family again.

36:50.495 --> 36:53.529
You know how I said we were
in uncharted waters?

36:53.564 --> 36:55.030
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, well,

36:55.066 --> 36:58.167
here's the most amazing
thing about them for me.

37:00.171 --> 37:02.104
For years, I have been afraid

37:02.140 --> 37:03.973
to tell you about the things I've known

37:04.008 --> 37:06.909
because I was afraid you would leave me.

37:06.944 --> 37:11.413
But... I'm not afraid anymore.

37:11.449 --> 37:15.217
You've left me, and I'm fine.

37:16.354 --> 37:17.953
I'm better than fine.

37:17.989 --> 37:19.889
So, you know how to go it alone.

37:19.924 --> 37:21.824
Doesn't mean you have to go it alone.

37:21.859 --> 37:25.094
But there are other reasons why
we shouldn't be together, Bill,

37:25.129 --> 37:27.997
reasons that I am no
longer afraid to say.

37:28.032 --> 37:29.665
Okay.

37:29.700 --> 37:31.667
So, tell me.

37:31.702 --> 37:33.569
I want to know.

37:33.604 --> 37:36.672
Remember that first spring
that you were in med school?

37:36.707 --> 37:38.941
I made all those flashcards
for your exams

37:38.976 --> 37:41.777
because it seemed like something
that a wife would do,

37:41.812 --> 37:45.781
and I had reason to believe
I might someday be your wife.

37:45.816 --> 37:50.286
Ruth, my roommate, told me that
you'd asked for my ring size.

37:50.321 --> 37:51.921
But then you called

37:51.956 --> 37:55.324
and you said you were
going away for the summer.

37:57.161 --> 37:59.862
I knew that it was another girl.

37:59.897 --> 38:01.630
That was the only explanation

38:01.666 --> 38:03.999
for why I didn't
hear from you all summer.

38:05.703 --> 38:09.004
And, uh, I've seen the photographs

38:09.040 --> 38:12.808
tucked away in the box in your closet...

38:12.843 --> 38:14.977
you waterskiing

38:15.012 --> 38:18.314
with Dody on your shoulders.

38:18.349 --> 38:21.016
The two of you
about to take off together

38:21.052 --> 38:23.485
in her brother's plane.

38:23.521 --> 38:25.532
And then at the end of the
summer, she broke your heart,

38:25.556 --> 38:27.223
and you came back to me.

38:27.258 --> 38:30.125
Well, because I-I realized

38:30.161 --> 38:31.860
that you were better for me.

38:31.896 --> 38:33.462
Because you realized

38:33.497 --> 38:37.132
that I wasn't going to
hurt you like that.

38:37.168 --> 38:39.201
Because I couldn't.

38:39.237 --> 38:41.136
Because you didn't love me.

38:41.172 --> 38:42.304
I loved you very much.

38:42.340 --> 38:44.807
Yes. Yes.

38:44.842 --> 38:47.376
But not in that way.

38:47.411 --> 38:49.345
Not in the way that makes you want

38:49.380 --> 38:51.780
to take off together in a plane.

38:54.018 --> 38:56.919
It's the same way
that you love Virginia.

38:56.954 --> 38:58.053
Come on, Bill.

38:58.089 --> 38:59.655
When the two of you are together,

38:59.690 --> 39:02.558
it's like you're...
you're in this bubble.

39:02.593 --> 39:05.094
It's like you... you speak
some secret language

39:05.129 --> 39:06.729
only the two of you can understand.

39:06.764 --> 39:09.064
But we hurt each other, Lib.

39:09.100 --> 39:12.368
Not as much as you
make each other happy.

39:14.538 --> 39:16.605
Bill,

39:16.641 --> 39:19.875
why have we endured all this pain,

39:19.910 --> 39:21.577
all this suffering

39:21.612 --> 39:24.446
if not for the two of
you to end up together?

39:28.619 --> 39:30.719
You belong together, Bill.

39:32.590 --> 39:37.559
And I belong with someone
who makes me feel that way.

39:55.946 --> 39:59.048
Oh, Dr. Bill.

39:59.083 --> 40:02.284
Sorry. I-I was just, um,
I was just freshening up.

40:02.320 --> 40:04.420
Are you living here?

40:04.455 --> 40:06.955
Flopping. Temporarily.

40:06.991 --> 40:09.725
Until I get enough money to
find something more permanent.

40:09.760 --> 40:11.760
This is not a shelter, Guy.

40:11.796 --> 40:13.295
This is a place of business.

40:13.331 --> 40:15.831
Look, we...

40:15.866 --> 40:17.644
we've had this trouble
before. I'm... I'm sorry.

40:17.668 --> 40:21.670
I'm gonna have to ask
you to... pack your bag and go.

40:21.706 --> 40:24.073
You firing me?

40:24.108 --> 40:25.441
Yes.

40:25.476 --> 40:27.076
Just like that?

40:27.111 --> 40:29.411
No... warning? No shot over the bow?

40:29.447 --> 40:31.080
It's just goodbye?

40:31.115 --> 40:34.583
Let's not make this any more
dramatic than it has to be.

40:34.618 --> 40:35.918
I'm sure you'll find other work.

40:35.953 --> 40:37.486
Not this kind of work.

40:37.521 --> 40:40.522
I mean, not in this kind of place.

40:42.626 --> 40:45.461
Is this about the background check?

40:45.496 --> 40:47.841
Betty told me that Dr.
Virginia asked for a background check,

40:47.865 --> 40:50.499
so I figured you knew
about everything that happened

40:50.534 --> 40:52.301
over there...

40:52.336 --> 40:55.304
in that beautiful little jungle
paradise called Vietnam.

40:55.339 --> 40:57.106
You were a soldier.

40:57.141 --> 40:59.508
And after four months
of exemplary service,

40:59.543 --> 41:02.611
I was dishonorably discharged
six weeks ago.

41:02.646 --> 41:04.546
I'm sure from all
the clients you see here,

41:04.582 --> 41:06.815
you can guess why.

41:06.851 --> 41:08.617
We treat dysfunction here, Guy.

41:08.652 --> 41:10.619
Homosexuality is not a dysfunction.

41:10.654 --> 41:12.721
Heh. Tell that to the Army.

41:12.757 --> 41:15.824
And my poor father.

41:15.860 --> 41:18.494
We've been at each other's
throats ever since I got back.

41:18.529 --> 41:21.363
He told all the neighbors
that I got shot in the arm.

41:21.399 --> 41:25.401
Even got me a little sling to
wear for whenever I go outside,

41:25.436 --> 41:28.504
'cause he's petrified
that his pals at the Elks Lodge

41:28.539 --> 41:30.083
are gonna find out that I got sent home

41:30.107 --> 41:32.608
for giving another private a blowjob.

41:36.414 --> 41:37.713
All right. I...

41:37.748 --> 41:40.482
I can't let you live here, but...

41:40.518 --> 41:42.229
I'll ask Betty if she'll
advance you some money

41:42.253 --> 41:43.519
from your first paycheck

41:43.554 --> 41:45.854
so you can find yourself a rental.

41:51.128 --> 41:52.694
Should I get that?

41:52.730 --> 41:54.430
- Yes.
- Oh...

41:54.465 --> 41:56.265
I'm gonna be late for court.

42:00.137 --> 42:02.438
- Good morning, St.
-35 a.m.,

42:02.473 --> 42:04.773
and here's a quick look
at today's weather.

42:04.809 --> 42:07.409
Current temperature is 64 degrees...

42:09.113 --> 42:10.546
Bill.

42:11.782 --> 42:13.415
Glad I caught you.

42:13.451 --> 42:16.084
The prosecution's sent
over a new witness list.

42:16.120 --> 42:18.020
There's a name on it I don't recognize.

42:18.055 --> 42:20.456
They can do that? Just
introduce a new witness?

42:20.491 --> 42:23.258
Yeah, trial by ambush,
but yes, they can.

42:23.294 --> 42:25.727
I need to know what
the witness is gonna say.

42:25.763 --> 42:27.763
Uh... here it is.

42:27.798 --> 42:29.431
Eliot Laskin.

42:29.467 --> 42:30.766
Hmm? Bachelor.

42:30.801 --> 42:32.201
Lives in an apartment in Rock Hill,

42:32.236 --> 42:33.702
works at the Shawnee Country Club,

42:33.737 --> 42:36.438
before that as a bellhop
at the Park Chancery Hotel...

42:36.474 --> 42:38.740
The Park Chancery?

42:38.776 --> 42:41.210
He... he's got
nothing to do with this case.

42:41.245 --> 42:42.322
Prosecution thinks he does.

42:42.346 --> 42:43.579
Well, believe me. He doesn't.

42:43.614 --> 42:46.215
You know him?

42:46.250 --> 42:49.084
They're trying to
bring up my private life to...

42:49.119 --> 42:51.286
somehow impugn my credibility.

42:51.322 --> 42:53.856
Solid tactic. Your credibility
is fair game.

42:56.293 --> 42:57.893
I'm your attorney, Bill.

42:57.928 --> 42:59.962
You got to tell me
what we're up against here.

43:02.166 --> 43:05.934
Okay, they're gonna call him to testify

43:05.970 --> 43:08.737
that, for the last ten years,

43:08.772 --> 43:11.640
Virginia Johnson and I have been...

43:11.675 --> 43:13.942
meeting at the Park Chancery.

43:13.978 --> 43:15.344
Meeting?

43:16.614 --> 43:18.614
Ah, meeting.

43:18.649 --> 43:21.116
Okay, well, adultery is against the law,

43:21.151 --> 43:23.085
so they plan on
portraying you as a criminal.

43:23.120 --> 43:24.965
For committing a crime
that hasn't been prosecuted

43:24.989 --> 43:26.421
in 100 years?

43:26.457 --> 43:27.856
If they want to bring this in,

43:27.892 --> 43:29.291
it's going to get in.

43:32.229 --> 43:34.196
Look, it'll be worse
for her than it is for you.

43:34.231 --> 43:37.132
Adultery sticks to a
woman more than a man.

43:37.167 --> 43:39.868
You're a doctor who works long
hours with a gorgeous woman.

43:39.904 --> 43:42.371
You study sex together.
Of course you dabbled.

43:42.406 --> 43:44.039
No one will blame you.

43:44.074 --> 43:45.719
You know, it'll
forever be what people think of

43:45.743 --> 43:48.810
when they hear Masters and Johnson.

43:48.846 --> 43:50.846
We won't be the dispassionate
scientists,

43:50.881 --> 43:52.848
studying a cause for the greater good.

43:52.883 --> 43:55.183
We'll be cheaters,

43:55.219 --> 43:58.654
our sexual behavior
informing our results.

43:58.689 --> 44:00.489
It'll be on the court record.

44:00.524 --> 44:01.523
It'll be in the press.

44:01.559 --> 44:04.159
Hell, in... In my obituary.

44:08.065 --> 44:11.533
I can't distance myself
from her professionally.

44:11.569 --> 44:13.368
Nor would I want to.

44:13.404 --> 44:16.204
Our partnership has yielded good work,

44:16.240 --> 44:18.840
and hopefully with more to come.

44:18.876 --> 44:21.209
But our...

44:21.245 --> 44:24.479
But our affair...

44:24.515 --> 44:27.382
was a mistake.

44:27.418 --> 44:29.818
And I can't allow
evidence of that mistake

44:29.853 --> 44:33.088
to be following me around
for the rest of my life.

44:33.123 --> 44:35.691
I think we should take a plea.

44:35.726 --> 44:37.893
I told you, Bill, a plea
is the one avenue

44:37.928 --> 44:39.227
that leads to certain defeat.

44:39.263 --> 44:40.562
There'll be no appeal, no glory.

44:40.598 --> 44:42.097
But it'll be done.

44:42.132 --> 44:43.498
Even if I did pursue one,

44:43.534 --> 44:46.201
there's no way
Virginia would get on board.

44:46.236 --> 44:47.936
I sold her on staying the course.

44:47.972 --> 44:50.105
You saw her eyes light up
when I said "Supreme Court."

44:50.140 --> 44:52.240
I need to put this behind me.

44:58.082 --> 44:59.848
There's nothing in my book.

44:59.883 --> 45:01.361
There's... there's
no appointments at all.

45:01.385 --> 45:03.552
I-I was told by Dr.
Masters to clear the whole day.

45:03.587 --> 45:05.787
I spoke on the telephone
with Mrs. Johnson,

45:05.823 --> 45:08.423
and she personally confirmed
these dates with me.

45:08.459 --> 45:10.592
- You're sure, Harriet?
- Of course I'm sure.

45:10.628 --> 45:13.462
And I am sure that you're right,
but Mrs. Johnson didn't tell me.

45:13.497 --> 45:15.230
Can I help with something?

45:15.265 --> 45:16.242
There's been a terrible mix-up.

45:16.266 --> 45:17.699
I'm sorry.

45:17.735 --> 45:20.202
Dr. Masters and Mrs. Johnson
are unreachable today.

45:20.237 --> 45:22.549
The Clavermores have
travelled all the way from Philadelphia.

45:22.573 --> 45:24.473
Clavermore. Of course.

45:24.508 --> 45:26.541
I thought I recognized you.

45:26.577 --> 45:29.544
Didn't Time magazine call you
"The Man Who Fights Fire"?

45:29.580 --> 45:31.279
Mr. Clavermore

45:31.315 --> 45:34.316
runs the largest
asbestos manufacturing plant

45:34.351 --> 45:35.984
I think in North America.

45:36.020 --> 45:37.786
And you must be Mrs. Clavermore.

45:37.821 --> 45:39.421
- I'm Dr. Leveau.
- Well...

45:39.456 --> 45:41.823
I, uh, I work very closely

45:41.859 --> 45:44.326
with both Dr. Masters and Mrs. Johnson.

45:44.361 --> 45:45.927
I can assure you if they were here,

45:45.963 --> 45:48.497
ooh, they'd be mortified
by what's happened.

45:48.532 --> 45:50.899
Happily, I think I can
provide a solution.

45:50.934 --> 45:53.168
Why don't I begin your intake?

45:59.443 --> 46:00.842
Helen?

46:03.781 --> 46:05.647
Hel?

46:05.683 --> 46:07.249
Hey.

46:07.284 --> 46:09.718
Hey. What's wrong?

46:12.856 --> 46:15.590
I did what you said. I...

46:15.626 --> 46:19.094
I told them the truth about...

46:19.129 --> 46:21.663
myself, and...

46:21.699 --> 46:24.466
you, and the baby.

46:24.501 --> 46:26.868
Oh, honey.

46:26.904 --> 46:28.904
What did... what did they say?

46:30.908 --> 46:33.709
Nothing.

46:33.744 --> 46:37.179
They just packed their stuff and left.

46:38.916 --> 46:41.283
I couldn't stop them.

46:41.318 --> 46:43.952
And I've been calling
and calling, and...

46:43.987 --> 46:46.221
it just rings and rings.

46:46.256 --> 46:48.223
They...

46:48.258 --> 46:51.893
they must have pulled
the c-cord out of the w-wall.

46:59.737 --> 47:02.637
I keep thinking about
this dollhouse I used to have

47:02.673 --> 47:04.873
when I was ten.

47:06.910 --> 47:10.512
Three stories. My dad made it.

47:10.547 --> 47:12.180
So many rooms, and...

47:14.184 --> 47:17.519
I'd lie on my stomach with my dolls...

47:17.554 --> 47:19.921
The father and the mother
and the daughter...

47:19.957 --> 47:22.758
And I'd put them in different rooms

47:22.793 --> 47:26.728
and make up things that
they'd say to each other.

47:26.764 --> 47:29.765
And I knew...

47:29.800 --> 47:33.101
that I was never gonna live
in a house like that...

47:34.538 --> 47:37.572
...or have a family like that family.

47:40.611 --> 47:44.045
My family will always be
my own mother and father.

47:45.315 --> 47:48.583
And now... now...

47:48.619 --> 47:50.786
And me.

47:50.821 --> 47:52.854
Me.

47:52.890 --> 47:54.589
And you.

47:54.625 --> 47:56.491
And this baby.

47:57.795 --> 48:00.529
We're your family.

48:00.564 --> 48:04.065
And... and we're gonna
take care of each other.

48:09.173 --> 48:11.072
Yeah.

48:19.683 --> 48:21.316
All rise.

48:29.326 --> 48:31.726
I'm so sorry.

48:31.762 --> 48:34.262
I came straight from the airport.

48:34.298 --> 48:35.764
Good news, Bill.

48:35.799 --> 48:37.732
- I need to talk to you.
- I need to talk to you.

48:37.768 --> 48:40.635
Bob Drag is back on the book.

48:40.671 --> 48:42.437
And I talked to the head of publishing.

48:42.472 --> 48:44.639
They are putting it
on the priority list.

48:46.009 --> 48:48.076
Bailiff, call the jury in, please.

48:48.111 --> 48:49.878
Your Honor...

48:52.349 --> 48:53.949
What is it, Dr. Masters?

48:55.285 --> 48:57.252
I would be willing to discuss a plea

48:57.321 --> 48:59.421
if the prosecution would be willing

48:59.456 --> 49:01.756
to drop the charges
against Mrs. Johnson.

49:03.861 --> 49:06.361
Your Honor, may we discuss this?

49:06.396 --> 49:09.531
My entire negotiation
with Little Brown was based

49:09.566 --> 49:11.600
on the fact that we would
fight these charges

49:11.635 --> 49:13.101
and not plead guilty.

49:13.136 --> 49:15.170
Listen to her, Bill. I still
believe we can win.

49:15.205 --> 49:16.471
Can you give us a moment?

49:18.842 --> 49:20.220
I thought about it, and you were right.

49:20.244 --> 49:21.321
We shouldn't roll the dice.

49:21.345 --> 49:23.879
The book, Bill. Our reputations.

49:23.914 --> 49:25.191
Our reputations are gonna be tainted.

49:25.215 --> 49:26.047
Only if we plead...

49:26.083 --> 49:27.649
Eliot Laskin,

49:27.684 --> 49:29.985
the bellhop from
the Park Chancery Hotel,

49:30.020 --> 49:32.888
is gonna testify.

49:32.923 --> 49:34.901
Keller's made it clear
it's gonna be much worse for you

49:34.925 --> 49:36.892
than it is for me.

49:36.927 --> 49:39.494
Do you really want
all the work you've done,

49:39.529 --> 49:41.963
everything you've achieved,
to be thrown into question?

49:41.999 --> 49:43.732
Now, like you said many times,

49:43.767 --> 49:45.834
the surrogacy program was my idea.

49:45.869 --> 49:47.802
It was my mistake,

49:47.838 --> 49:50.071
and now I'm gonna make it right.

49:50.107 --> 49:51.539
Judge is waiting.

49:57.848 --> 49:59.425
Your Honor, the prosecution will dismiss

49:59.449 --> 50:01.383
the charges against Mrs. Johnson

50:01.418 --> 50:03.919
if Dr. Masters will
agree to plead guilty

50:03.954 --> 50:06.321
to the charge of sexual deviance

50:06.356 --> 50:08.323
and to pay a fine of $500.

50:08.358 --> 50:10.859
Your Honor, I will
plead guilty to the charge.

50:10.894 --> 50:13.061
You're a public figure, Dr. Masters,

50:13.096 --> 50:14.896
so I must point out

50:14.932 --> 50:17.165
that if you accept this plea,

50:17.200 --> 50:19.534
you will be required
to go into that courtroom

50:19.569 --> 50:22.570
and stand in front
of a jury and the press,

50:22.606 --> 50:25.707
and admit to being a sexual deviant.

50:29.546 --> 50:32.614
Sexual deviant.

50:32.649 --> 50:35.216
I'm a scientist who's spent
decades of my life

50:35.252 --> 50:36.418
researching sex.

50:36.453 --> 50:38.954
Even I don't know what that means.

50:38.989 --> 50:41.923
How can something deviate
when there is no norm?

50:43.493 --> 50:47.062
No two humans would...
paint the same painting

50:47.097 --> 50:50.131
or write the same poem
or compose the same opera,

50:50.167 --> 50:51.599
so why would we expect two humans

50:51.635 --> 50:54.569
to express their sexuality
in the same way?

50:54.604 --> 50:56.137
In fact, if there is one thing

50:56.173 --> 50:57.739
the years of research has taught us,

50:57.774 --> 51:00.809
it's that no being's sexual response

51:00.844 --> 51:02.811
is formed on an assembly line.

51:02.846 --> 51:07.482
There is no shape... it must take.

51:07.517 --> 51:09.884
It's as particular

51:09.920 --> 51:13.321
and individualistic as...

51:13.357 --> 51:14.356
a kiss.

51:15.959 --> 51:19.127
And where there is
such infinite variety,

51:19.162 --> 51:21.429
there's no norm.

51:21.465 --> 51:23.298
There's only deviation.

51:24.768 --> 51:26.634
Your honor, I am willing to plead guilty

51:26.670 --> 51:30.672
to sexual deviance,

51:30.707 --> 51:33.842
because I am a sexual deviant,

51:33.877 --> 51:37.479
because we are all sexual deviants.

51:40.650 --> 51:42.751
Go out there and say that to the jury.

51:42.786 --> 51:45.320
We can still win in the
court of public opinion.

51:50.627 --> 51:53.028
The charge is sexual deviance.

51:53.063 --> 51:56.431
How do you plead, sir?

51:56.466 --> 51:58.433
Your honor, I ask you:

51:58.468 --> 52:00.702
how can something deviate
when there is no normal...

52:00.737 --> 52:03.471
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Dr. Masters.

52:03.507 --> 52:06.908
There will be no oration
in my courtroom.

52:08.412 --> 52:10.945
The charge is sexual deviance.

52:10.981 --> 52:12.547
How do you plead?

52:19.523 --> 52:21.056
Guilty.

52:39.209 --> 52:41.876
I thought you were a
man who liked winning.

52:41.912 --> 52:45.547
And yet, your client just
pleaded to sexual deviance.

52:45.582 --> 52:48.016
It was not my idea. Believe me.

52:48.051 --> 52:49.184
It was his entirely.

52:49.219 --> 52:51.152
But why?

52:51.188 --> 52:54.923
I don't understand. It's...
It's not like Bill not to fight.

52:54.958 --> 52:56.691
A witness was gonna come forward.

52:56.726 --> 52:59.994
Things were gonna be said
that would've been bad for Bill,

53:00.030 --> 53:04.032
bad for Virginia, and...

53:04.067 --> 53:06.968
and it would have been entirely
embarrassing to you.

53:09.139 --> 53:10.538
Well,

53:10.574 --> 53:13.575
I do want to put all of that behind me.

53:13.610 --> 53:14.742
So does your husband.

53:14.778 --> 53:17.612
Ex-husband.

53:17.647 --> 53:20.081
Well, that right there...
That's a fresh start.

53:23.153 --> 53:26.087
What is your position on marijuana?

53:26.123 --> 53:27.856
Firm represented LeMar.

53:27.891 --> 53:29.769
They're marijuana activists
based in Washington.

53:29.793 --> 53:31.392
So I say legalize the plant.

53:31.428 --> 53:34.395
And oral sex?

53:36.099 --> 53:37.599
Um, legalize that too.

53:37.634 --> 53:40.135
I'm a huge proponent.
Why are you asking?

53:40.170 --> 53:41.269
What about marriage?

53:41.304 --> 53:42.537
I've had three,

53:42.572 --> 53:44.606
each one more acrimonious than the last.

53:44.641 --> 53:46.741
I don't plan to ever
stand at the altar again.

53:46.776 --> 53:49.043
What about dinner?

53:49.079 --> 53:50.979
My favorite meal of the day.

53:51.014 --> 53:54.082
I mean how would you like
to take me to dinner?

53:55.285 --> 53:56.618
Yes, please.

53:58.155 --> 54:00.088
There are 50 reporters
from every newspaper

54:00.123 --> 54:01.890
and television station in the country.

54:01.925 --> 54:03.625
Now is your chance to do your speech.

54:07.964 --> 54:09.264
- Bill...
- Please, don't.

54:09.299 --> 54:11.065
No. I have to. I have to say thank you

54:11.101 --> 54:12.734
for what you did for me,

54:12.769 --> 54:14.269
for the sacrifice that you made.

54:14.304 --> 54:15.770
- It wasn't a sacrifice.
- Bill...

54:15.805 --> 54:19.474
It wasn't. I did not do this for you

54:19.509 --> 54:21.309
or Libby or anyone else.

54:21.344 --> 54:24.512
I did it for myself.

54:24.548 --> 54:28.483
And I'm sorry if it's
ruined things for the book.

54:28.518 --> 54:31.819
I... I care about the book, of course,

54:31.855 --> 54:33.621
and I care about all of the work,

54:33.657 --> 54:35.657
but I care more about the two of us.

54:39.162 --> 54:42.497
I know that you've
always tried to protect me.

54:42.532 --> 54:46.034
You put my name on the study
so that I would get credit.

54:46.069 --> 54:48.303
And now you sacrifice your reputation

54:48.338 --> 54:50.805
so I don't get the blame.

54:50.840 --> 54:53.107
I know what you did, Bill,

54:53.143 --> 54:55.143
and I know why you did it.

54:59.149 --> 55:04.118
We have been through... a lot,

55:04.154 --> 55:06.354
the two of us.

55:08.258 --> 55:10.792
But now, finally,

55:10.827 --> 55:14.662
we are back where we belong.

55:14.698 --> 55:16.564
Together.

55:16.600 --> 55:18.833
What do you... What
do you mean, "together"?

55:18.868 --> 55:21.202
I mean I...

55:21.238 --> 55:23.671
I want us to be together.

55:46.563 --> 55:48.107
I'm grateful for the opportunity

55:48.131 --> 55:49.897
to speak to you today.

55:51.868 --> 55:56.204
I thought there was nothing
for me in this program,

55:56.239 --> 56:00.742
because, well, I'm not an alcoholic.

56:03.713 --> 56:07.582
But I've come to realize that, uh,

56:07.617 --> 56:11.419
I am an addict... of sorts.

56:14.391 --> 56:15.690
Some of you, all it takes is

56:15.725 --> 56:18.593
a flashing neon sign for cocktails.

56:20.897 --> 56:24.732
For me, well, I can pass
that same sign a thousand times

56:24.768 --> 56:26.100
and never even notice it.

56:26.136 --> 56:29.537
For me, it's...

56:29.572 --> 56:31.439
it's something else.

56:33.576 --> 56:35.009
It's a passing glance.

56:38.448 --> 56:40.815
Fingers brushing against my shoulder.

56:43.753 --> 56:46.487
The linger of perfume when
she's already left the room.

56:48.925 --> 56:50.692
Her hand in mine.

56:53.463 --> 56:56.130
In an instant, I'm r...
I'm ready to give everything up.

56:56.166 --> 56:59.000
I'm... I... I'm
prepared to throw it all away.

56:59.035 --> 57:01.436
My work,

57:01.471 --> 57:03.104
my pride...

57:05.308 --> 57:07.108
...my self-respect.

57:14.451 --> 57:17.185
I'm Bill,

57:17.220 --> 57:19.687
and I'm here to ask for your help.
