00:12.213 --> 00:13.679
Is that what I am?

00:15.049 --> 00:18.317
No, you're... my best friend.

01:08.169 --> 01:09.868
Moving is stupid.

01:09.870 --> 01:11.870
I don't need to move,
plus Cameron's cool.

01:11.872 --> 01:13.439
Oh, I will miss his sheets.

01:13.441 --> 01:16.275
That thread count was ridiculous.

01:16.277 --> 01:18.444
I don't think Cameron
really liked us on his bed.

As if lord of the purity rings
ever used it.

01:21.115 --> 01:22.948
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure.

01:22.950 --> 01:26.085
All right, you know what,
we really should get going.

01:26.087 --> 01:27.886
Excuse me, Linus,

01:27.888 --> 01:30.289
are you keeping juicy goss from me?

01:30.291 --> 01:33.058
Come on, you know how this goes.
Bros before...

01:33.060 --> 01:35.227
check yourself. Spill.

01:35.229 --> 01:36.295
Cameron met a girl.

01:36.297 --> 01:37.796
- And?
- Her name is Nina.

01:37.798 --> 01:39.364
- And?
- That is all I know.

01:39.366 --> 01:41.700
Oh.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.702
Except for the fact he was
on the phone with her until

01:43.704 --> 01:45.504
3:00 A.M. last night
talking about <i> doctor who.</i>

01:46.574 --> 01:49.475
David Tennant this,
TARDIS that, all night long.

01:49.477 --> 01:51.543
I love my time lords

01:51.545 --> 01:53.078
but I need eight hours of man sleep.

01:53.080 --> 01:54.746
- (Door opens)
- Sounds like an episode of <i> Nerd Love.</i>

01:54.748 --> 01:56.315
Wait, does Kirsten know about Nina?

01:57.251 --> 01:58.251
She does now.

02:01.288 --> 02:02.721
I'll check on her.

02:02.723 --> 02:04.189
I'm gonna wait outside.

02:07.261 --> 02:08.759
Hey, roomie.

02:08.762 --> 02:11.797
I already knew
about Nina, so don't worry.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.966
You know, I told Cameron
not to wait around

02:13.968 --> 02:16.602
while I figured out my feelings, so...

02:16.604 --> 02:18.303
I can't be mad.

02:20.074 --> 02:22.141
And I'm not.

02:22.143 --> 02:25.110
Okay. Something's got you
off-balance. What's going on?

02:25.112 --> 02:27.246
My father had a first wife.

02:27.248 --> 02:28.680
Elizabeth.

02:28.682 --> 02:32.784
I found a cocktail napkin from
their wedding in the garage.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.586
Damn, you didn't know?

02:34.588 --> 02:36.321
Nope, I had no idea.

02:36.323 --> 02:37.990
Daddy was a player.

02:37.992 --> 02:39.691
Hmm.

02:39.693 --> 02:43.295
I mean, if I could find Elizabeth,
she may know where my father is.

02:43.297 --> 02:45.998
But she's just...
she's so hard to locate.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.499
You already tried hacking city records?

02:47.501 --> 02:49.434
Yeah, I've tried everything.

02:49.436 --> 02:52.171
Elizabeth Stinger is basically a ghost.

02:52.173 --> 02:54.873
Well, true, but hunting ghosts
is kind of what we do.

03:45.426 --> 03:48.727
She worked as a receptionist,
but was an aspiring actress.

03:48.729 --> 03:51.496
She fell to her death from the
roof of her apartment building.

03:51.498 --> 03:52.864
Murder? Suicide?

03:52.866 --> 03:53.932
- Was there a note?
- Yes.

03:53.934 --> 03:55.234
So, suicide?

03:55.236 --> 03:57.469
It wasn't that kind of note.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.407
"This is his fault. K.C."

04:02.409 --> 04:04.443
We've confirmed
that it is her handwriting.

04:04.445 --> 04:06.945
Is there anyone in Sandy's life
with the initials K.C.?

04:06.947 --> 04:09.381
A preliminary background check
came up with

04:09.383 --> 04:12.217
no friends or relatives
with that name or initials.

04:12.219 --> 04:14.253
K.C., Kirsten Clark.

04:14.255 --> 04:15.721
Or not.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.255
You're just reading into things

04:17.257 --> 04:18.790
'cause you're focused on

04:22.062 --> 04:23.462
Camille has a point, which is why

04:23.464 --> 04:25.130
we're not going to stitch into Sandy.

04:25.132 --> 04:26.598
Why? It's the only way to know for sure

04:26.600 --> 04:28.367
if this note was meant for me.

04:28.369 --> 04:31.303
Okay, let's say for a moment
that the note was meant for you.

04:31.305 --> 04:34.039
How do we know that it's not
an ambush of some kind?

04:34.041 --> 04:36.942
We're going to stand down until I get
further instructions from Blair.

04:36.944 --> 04:39.711
And how long is that gonna take? We
could lose the window to stitch.

04:39.713 --> 04:42.481
As long as it takes.
He's aware of the situation.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.249
But I have discovered

04:44.251 --> 04:46.752
that Mitchell Blair moves
at his own pace.

04:46.754 --> 04:48.787
Look, the note says this is "his" fault.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.088
What if that means my father?

04:50.090 --> 04:51.757
We won't know if we don't stitch in.

04:51.759 --> 04:54.559
That is a leap, and I'm not
going to put you in danger.

04:54.561 --> 04:55.727
We hold.

04:59.333 --> 05:00.966
That's two.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.334
Four.

05:03.270 --> 05:04.403
And you're done.

05:04.405 --> 05:05.437

- Nice job.

Hi. What the hell?
What are you doing here?

05:20.754 --> 05:22.421
Same as you, I imagine.

05:22.423 --> 05:24.956
Yeah. Duh, I just meant, uh...

05:24.958 --> 05:26.458
What are you doing in Los Angeles?

05:26.460 --> 05:28.760
I thought you'd be
living in Europe by now.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.529
Ah, that was the plan,

05:30.531 --> 05:32.164
then a teaching gig came up.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.633
I guess I wasn't really ready to leave.

05:34.635 --> 05:36.101
Uh-huh.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.836
Does Kirsten know you're here?

05:37.838 --> 05:39.104
I'd rather she not know.

05:39.106 --> 05:40.339
I'm still sorting out some stuff.

05:40.341 --> 05:41.940
How is she?

05:43.043 --> 05:44.409
Um... (Clears throat)

05:45.679 --> 05:47.212
The truth is...

05:47.214 --> 05:49.614
She has totally moved on.

05:49.616 --> 05:51.383
Totally?

05:51.385 --> 05:52.684
As in completely.

05:54.188 --> 05:55.354
She ever say anything?

05:55.356 --> 05:56.455
About you?

05:56.457 --> 05:59.758
No, bud, I mean completely completely.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.161
Wow. Well...

06:03.163 --> 06:04.696
Suppose I shouldn't be surprised.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.666
That's much like her,
not much affected by things.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.534
Yeah, she's...

06:09.536 --> 06:12.637
Gotten a lot better about that recently.

06:12.639 --> 06:14.005
She's kind of a different person.

06:14.007 --> 06:15.307
Really?

06:15.309 --> 06:17.269
But not so different
that she's interested in you.

06:18.579 --> 06:19.978
Thank you.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.381
- For?
- For not giving me false hope.

06:22.383 --> 06:23.615
Oh, well...

06:24.752 --> 06:26.184
Would you like to get together sometime?

06:26.186 --> 06:28.754
Oh, can we get some water
for this man's thirst?

06:28.756 --> 06:30.422
- I'm... no, I...
- anybody? You guys know.

06:30.424 --> 06:33.392
I'm talking take down techniques
and hammer fists only.

06:33.394 --> 06:35.560

06:42.669 --> 06:44.336

06:44.338 --> 06:48.173
"completely completely" not happening.

07:00.354 --> 07:01.787

07:01.789 --> 07:03.021
Can I get your number?

07:03.023 --> 07:04.289

07:25.245 --> 07:27.279
Trying to get a workout in.

07:27.281 --> 07:28.780
What? What's the emergency?

07:28.782 --> 07:31.249
Veronica Mars here wants
to stitch into Sandy.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.484
Maggie gave the go-ahead?

07:33.720 --> 07:36.054
Okay, then we're going
behind Maggie's back.

07:36.056 --> 07:37.422
Intriguing, tell me more.

07:37.424 --> 07:39.424
I can't stop thinking about that note.

07:39.426 --> 07:40.625
What if it was meant for me?

07:40.627 --> 07:42.294
Look, I know you're focusing
on finding your father,

07:42.296 --> 07:44.396
but honestly, it sounds
like a stretch, stretch.

07:44.398 --> 07:46.064
Not all roads lead to Daniel Stinger.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.232
Yeah, but what if this one does?

07:47.234 --> 07:48.633
What if... what if we look back

07:48.635 --> 07:50.135
and it turns out to have been
the key to finding him

07:50.137 --> 07:52.838
and I just... sat around
and did nothing?

07:52.840 --> 07:54.473
I mean, come on, guys.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.943
I cannot do this alone. I really need...

07:57.945 --> 07:59.711
stop. Okay, just stop.

08:01.114 --> 08:02.447
You had him at "hello."

08:02.449 --> 08:04.182
First of all, she didn't.
Second, nice reference.

08:04.184 --> 08:05.517
Third...

08:05.519 --> 08:07.185
Okay, you have me now.

08:07.187 --> 08:08.520
I'm in.

08:08.522 --> 08:09.721
Makes two of us.

08:17.264 --> 08:19.331
I... hate...

08:19.333 --> 08:21.533
Peer pressure... because...

08:21.535 --> 08:23.468
I always cave.

08:23.470 --> 08:25.670
All right. Looks like
we're doing a midnight stitch.

08:25.672 --> 08:28.006
You know there's no way
to keep this from Maggie.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.641
As soon as you bring the systems online,

08:29.643 --> 08:30.642
she'll get pinged on her phone.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.443
Well, that'll give us about 23 minutes

08:32.446 --> 08:33.678
by the time she jumps out of bed

08:33.679 --> 08:35.313
to the time she arrives at the lab

08:35.315 --> 08:36.881
and then breaks her foot
off in our asses.

08:36.884 --> 08:38.683
Mm. Fortunately for us,
there are four of us

08:38.684 --> 08:40.684
and she only has two feet.
So, half of us will survive.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.721
What's she gonna do? Fire us?

08:42.722 --> 08:44.523
Well, not if she kills us first.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.959
Okay, let's do it.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.194
(Ding)

08:54.167 --> 08:55.467
All right.

08:57.004 --> 08:58.370
Suit up, stretch.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.880
(Keyboard clicking)

09:08.882 --> 09:10.916
All right, so the moment
I push this button,

09:10.918 --> 09:12.984
we got 23 minutes
before Maggie shows up.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.253
Oh, you mean this button right here?

09:20.060 --> 09:21.626
(Phone vibrates)

09:26.366 --> 09:28.233
Son of a bitch.

09:28.235 --> 09:31.036
Uh, yeah... that one.

09:31.038 --> 09:32.904
Well, I guess we have 23 minutes.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.339
- Camille, step into life-sci.
- On it.

09:34.341 --> 09:35.740
You'll have to double up
on the engineering

09:35.742 --> 09:37.008
while monitoring communications.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.543
I'll reroute Tim's console over to mine.

09:38.545 --> 09:40.912
I'll monitor sub-bio
and medical while doing me.

09:40.914 --> 09:41.947
Time to get wet!

09:41.949 --> 09:44.249
All right, guys, we've got...

09:44.251 --> 09:46.284
- (Click)
- Eight minutes before Maggie arrives.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.186
Let's set the mission
clock to a full five.

09:48.188 --> 09:50.188
Since we're limited on time,
I'll keep things quick.

09:50.190 --> 09:51.723
I need a go, no-go for stitch neurosync.

09:51.725 --> 09:54.359
Life-sci, sub-bio, engineering,
communications, medical,

09:54.361 --> 09:56.294
and I'll throw a com check
in there for good measure.

09:56.296 --> 09:57.762
- I hear you.
- We all do.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.264
Tick-tock, Goodkin.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.632
Okay, guys, you know the drill.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.100
Induce stitch neurosync on my mark.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.436
Three, two, one, mark!

10:11.612 --> 10:14.112
Oh, it looks like the roof
was Sandy's happy place.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.480
She's reading something.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.149
A script.

10:18.151 --> 10:19.818
Cameron: <i>Makes sense.
She was an actress.</i>

10:25.759 --> 10:27.158
- Hey!
- "Hey" what?

10:27.160 --> 10:29.127
- Talk to me, goose.
- The boy is here.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.562
Which boy? The red cap kid?

10:30.564 --> 10:32.397
- Yeah.
- My map coding is consistent

10:32.399 --> 10:33.465
with the last time she saw him.

10:33.467 --> 10:34.733
I'm going after him.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.801
Cameron: <i>No, stay on point!</i>

10:37.771 --> 10:39.938
Uh, her pulse is elevated.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.840
Kirsten, you don't have time.

10:43.810 --> 10:44.843
He's gone.

10:44.845 --> 10:47.946
I have memory jumped to a grassy area

10:47.948 --> 10:49.147
outside an office building.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.760
What is this?

11:01.762 --> 11:04.002
The only thing in nature
that comes close to your beauty.

11:04.765 --> 11:06.865
Stop giving me flowers.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.500
It's over between us.

11:08.502 --> 11:09.968
Kirsten: Sandy has a creepy guy at work.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.603
He's way too into her.

11:11.605 --> 11:12.871
We're meant to be together.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.543
Just back the hell off.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.894
Okay, this is weird.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.062
Weird like "interesting"

11:37.064 --> 11:38.830
or weird like
"get your ass out of there"?

11:38.832 --> 11:41.800
It's weird like "what the hell?"

11:50.811 --> 11:52.043
(Alarm blaring)

11:52.045 --> 11:53.745
Oh, oh, crap. We got a problem.

11:54.915 --> 11:56.515
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Kirsten, stay with me.

11:58.852 --> 12:00.552
- Dammit.
- We need to pull her out!

12:00.554 --> 12:02.020
We gotta get these levels stabilized.

12:02.022 --> 12:03.788
The readings are
off the freakin' charts!

12:07.728 --> 12:08.993
Kirsten, come in! Com check one, two!

12:08.995 --> 12:10.662
Kirsten, can you hear me?
What is happening?

12:10.664 --> 12:12.230
What's going on?
Where... where the hell is she?

12:12.232 --> 12:13.264
I can't tell.

12:13.266 --> 12:14.899
We've never mapped
an area like this before.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.534
- Well, figure it out!
- And fast.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.269
I'm not sure how much more
of this she can take.

12:18.271 --> 12:19.904
Okay, I'm moving her backwards.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.272
Hold on, Kirsten.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.780
What happened? Where am I?

12:28.782 --> 12:29.914
You're safely back in Kansas, Dorothy.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.382
<i>- What the hell was that?</i>
- Sandy: Get off!

12:31.384 --> 12:33.218
Kirsten: I don't know.
Wait, it feels like

12:33.220 --> 12:35.920
someone's pushing me... Sandy... us.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.255
(Sandy wails)

12:39.593 --> 12:40.959
- (Grunting)
- (Clang)

12:45.799 --> 12:47.098
Sandy didn't jump.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.733
(Ding)

12:48.735 --> 12:50.902
What the hell is going on?

12:50.904 --> 12:53.238
21 minutes, not 23.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.006
I made all the lights.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.815
Remember me saying not to stitch

13:03.817 --> 13:04.949
until we knew it was safe?

13:04.951 --> 13:05.950
I know it was me saying it.

13:05.952 --> 13:08.486
Uh... yup, I recognize my voice.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.288
I'm fine. Nothing bad happened.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.589
That is not my point!

13:11.591 --> 13:13.158
You went behind my back.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.660
We're a team. At least,
I thought that we were.

13:15.662 --> 13:17.262
You're right, Maggie. We're sorry.

13:17.264 --> 13:19.097
It's not their fault. It's...

13:19.099 --> 13:20.899
I had to know if the note was a clue.

13:20.901 --> 13:25.403
This is not the <i> help Kirsten
Clark find her daddy</i> show.

13:28.775 --> 13:30.175
I'm sorry.

13:30.177 --> 13:31.409
We all are.

13:33.246 --> 13:35.980
Did you at least find out
what the note meant?

13:37.951 --> 13:40.285
No. We couldn't access
all of her memories.

13:40.287 --> 13:42.787
They were blocked
by some sort of barrier.

13:42.789 --> 13:44.756
I have to run some diagnostics on it.

13:44.758 --> 13:45.990
Do it.

13:45.992 --> 13:48.293
The rest of you focus
on who killed Sandy.

13:48.295 --> 13:50.895
And don't you ever pull
a stunt like this again!

14:03.543 --> 14:05.223
I think that's the guy
I saw in the stitch.

14:07.214 --> 14:08.646
- Uh-oh.
- What's wrong?

14:08.648 --> 14:10.014
I know that look. We got a runner.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.149
That means he's guilty, right?

14:11.151 --> 14:13.017
Of something.
Possibly just being an idiot.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.052
What should I do?

14:14.054 --> 14:15.253
Flash your badge.

14:18.959 --> 14:21.192
Excuse me, I'm Kirsten Clark of NSA.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.394
This is Detective Quincy Fisher, LAPD.

14:26.499 --> 14:27.565
(Grunts)

14:29.002 --> 14:30.002
Get up.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.404
Nice.

14:32.405 --> 14:33.738
Well, I played hockey in high school.

14:33.740 --> 14:35.073
I didn't do anything wrong.

14:35.075 --> 14:36.307
Tell us about Sandy.

14:36.309 --> 14:37.575
There's nothing to tell.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.878
All right? We went out once
and she blew me off.

14:39.880 --> 14:42.080
I just wanted a second chance.

14:42.082 --> 14:43.402
She didn't have to call the cops.

14:45.085 --> 14:45.884
She didn't.

14:45.886 --> 14:47.118
Then why are you here?

14:50.056 --> 14:51.389
There's no scar.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.924
What are you talking about?

14:54.895 --> 14:56.095
Did something happen to Sandy?

14:56.897 --> 14:58.663
I'm afraid we have some bad news.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.468
- This it?
- Yeah, that's the one.

15:05.038 --> 15:06.905
(Knocking)

15:08.008 --> 15:09.008
(Latch clicks)

15:10.043 --> 15:11.576
Camille: Ben Spiros?

15:11.578 --> 15:12.877
Yeah?

15:12.879 --> 15:15.747
Agents Goodkin and Engleson, NSA.

15:15.749 --> 15:17.849
We're very sorry about Sandy.

15:19.352 --> 15:20.518
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, hey.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.480
We just need to ask you
some questions. That's it.

15:24.124 --> 15:26.391
Why is the government
so interested in Sandy?

15:26.393 --> 15:27.458
(Sniffs)

15:27.460 --> 15:29.093
Is that pot I smell?

15:29.095 --> 15:30.962
I have a prescription.

15:30.964 --> 15:32.697
Anxiety.

15:32.699 --> 15:33.731
Why are you so anxious?

15:33.733 --> 15:35.600
My girlfriend just died, man.

15:35.602 --> 15:38.036
We know. We're sorry.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.974
- (Breathing heavily)
- You okay?

15:43.944 --> 15:46.010
Yeah, man. It's my...
my head is just screwed up.

15:48.248 --> 15:49.981
So, um...

15:49.983 --> 15:52.283
Does Sandy have any enemies or, uh...

15:52.285 --> 15:53.818
Get in any fights with anyone lately?

15:53.820 --> 15:55.586
Dude, I don't know!

15:55.588 --> 15:57.822
I just want to go take a nap.

15:57.824 --> 16:00.425
Ben, listen, if you want to help Sandy,

16:00.427 --> 16:02.160
we're gonna need you to focus, okay?

16:02.162 --> 16:03.661
Why don't you find her?

16:03.663 --> 16:05.330
"Her"? Who's "her"?

16:05.332 --> 16:06.764
Kim.

16:06.766 --> 16:08.466
She moved in a few months ago.

16:08.468 --> 16:11.069
Sandy and I started
hanging out with her,

16:11.071 --> 16:12.503
meditating together.

16:12.505 --> 16:14.906
Kim was a teacher and then
she lost all interest in me

16:14.908 --> 16:16.841
and she just wanted
to spend time with Sandy.

16:16.843 --> 16:18.576
A lot of time.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.645
Pissed off all of Sandy's friends.

16:20.647 --> 16:23.414
Like pissed off enough that
someone would want Sandy dead?

16:26.252 --> 16:28.319
Sandy was good people, man.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.755
Hey, uh, is... is Kim home?

16:30.757 --> 16:32.323
No. She bugged out, like, a week ago.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.492
Okay. Did she leave anything behind?

16:37.130 --> 16:40.765
Some meditation tracks for me
and... and Sandy to chill to.

16:40.767 --> 16:42.200
- Meditation tracks?
- Yeah.

16:45.005 --> 16:47.138
(Dreamy music plays)

16:47.140 --> 16:49.040
Why'd Kim stop hanging out with you?

16:49.042 --> 16:50.241
(Music continues)

16:52.178 --> 16:54.178
Hey. Hey, tell us about Kim, okay?

16:54.180 --> 16:56.180
What was her last name?
What'd she look like?

16:58.218 --> 17:00.051
Excuse you.

17:00.053 --> 17:01.452
- What?
- (Sighs)

17:03.790 --> 17:05.223
(Music continues)

17:11.231 --> 17:12.231
Ben?

17:16.502 --> 17:17.769
Oh, crap!

17:19.138 --> 17:20.204
Hey!

17:22.075 --> 17:23.540
Are you okay?

17:23.542 --> 17:24.909
- Don't I look okay?
- Eh...

17:26.546 --> 17:29.080
Cameron, look.

17:29.082 --> 17:30.815
Call Fisher to tell him
we found the killer.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.086
Fisher just left
Ben Spiros at the hospital.

17:35.088 --> 17:37.155
He's in the psych ward for observation.

17:37.157 --> 17:39.090
Did he say why he pushed
Sandy off the roof?

17:39.092 --> 17:41.025
He claims he doesn't remember why.

17:41.027 --> 17:43.061
He only felt an incredible anger

17:43.063 --> 17:44.562
and then blacked out.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.197
He must be lying.

17:46.199 --> 17:48.866
Eh, maybe not. They found a bottle
of tomemoral in his apartment.

17:48.868 --> 17:51.235
It's a drug used to reduce memory loss.

17:51.237 --> 17:53.237
Apparently he's been complaining lately

17:53.239 --> 17:54.639
about forgetting things.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.040
Well, I heard him
listening to some kind of,

17:56.042 --> 17:58.176
like, meditation music
before he went to the roof.

17:58.178 --> 17:59.243
Meditation music?

17:59.245 --> 18:02.013
Camille is tracing
the company that created it.

18:02.015 --> 18:03.281
Camille: No, Camille traced it.

18:03.283 --> 18:04.248
There is no company.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.583
The track isn't available anywhere.

18:05.585 --> 18:06.684
Meaning what?

18:06.686 --> 18:08.186
Meaning the killer is in custody

18:08.188 --> 18:10.088
- and the case is essentially closed.
- (Phone beeps)

18:10.090 --> 18:13.057
Whoever K.C. is, he or she is not you.

18:13.059 --> 18:14.225
I'm not so sure.

18:14.227 --> 18:15.726
Drop it, Kirsten.

18:15.728 --> 18:17.195
We have done all that we can do tonight.

18:17.197 --> 18:19.097
We will take
a fresh look in the morning.

18:19.099 --> 18:21.966
And no more midnight stitching.

18:28.641 --> 18:29.841
Linus: Hey!

18:31.411 --> 18:32.877
Wanna do something?

18:32.879 --> 18:35.646
I... yes, but i... i have this huge

18:35.648 --> 18:38.282
optogenetics project due
and my lab partners

18:38.284 --> 18:40.418
may stone me if I don't
show up to work with them.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.120
Yeah. Okay.

18:42.122 --> 18:44.322
- I'll talk to you later?
- You know it.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.266
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:55.268 --> 18:56.300
Maggie in her office?

18:56.302 --> 18:57.902
- Yeah.
- You okay?

18:59.072 --> 19:00.805
Yeah. When am I not?

19:02.509 --> 19:03.674
Don't do it.

19:03.676 --> 19:05.109
Don't give me the cop glare.

19:05.111 --> 19:06.444
Well, then spill it.

19:06.446 --> 19:07.879
(Sighs)

19:09.149 --> 19:12.917
Do you ever feel
like you're in too deep?

19:13.820 --> 19:15.353
Are we talking about a case?

19:16.589 --> 19:17.622
(Clears throat)

19:17.624 --> 19:19.157
How do you...

19:20.326 --> 19:22.026
How do you stop the work from...

19:22.028 --> 19:24.162
Hurting the people you care about?

19:25.365 --> 19:26.964
Well...

19:26.966 --> 19:28.366
I wish I knew.

19:29.302 --> 19:30.768
It's hard for people without a badge

19:30.770 --> 19:31.969
to understand, you know?

19:31.971 --> 19:33.437
Yeah. Okay.

19:33.439 --> 19:34.639
Thanks for the pep talk.

19:34.641 --> 19:36.174
Well, lucky for you,

19:36.176 --> 19:37.975
I have a badge...

19:37.977 --> 19:39.677
And an ear you can bend any time.

19:49.055 --> 19:50.188
(Elevator dings)

19:54.961 --> 19:57.228
(Grunting)

19:58.398 --> 19:59.730
Whoo!

20:06.206 --> 20:08.072
Good. Learn your lesson?

20:08.074 --> 20:09.140
Done.

20:10.577 --> 20:13.744
Okay. This one's apparently
good for immunity,

20:13.746 --> 20:17.281
alkalization, and opening
your third eye chakra.

20:18.651 --> 20:20.084
A third eye-opener.

20:20.086 --> 20:21.919
That might be the most
la thing I've ever heard.

20:21.921 --> 20:25.323
Hey, man, you're the one who chose
to stay in traffic jam paradise.

20:29.195 --> 20:30.695
Why did you stay?

20:30.697 --> 20:33.731
And don't even tell me it was
"for the rewards of teaching."

20:33.733 --> 20:35.666
Really? You want to hear about this?

20:35.668 --> 20:37.034
Of course I do.

20:37.036 --> 20:39.870
It probably sounds pathetic,

20:39.872 --> 20:42.306
but I miss Kirsten.

20:43.276 --> 20:44.909
I miss how easy it was to be with her.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.677
(Retches) Oh my God, I'm so sorry.

20:46.679 --> 20:48.879
I just threw up
in my mouth a little bit.

20:48.881 --> 20:52.683
You mean you miss being with a woman who
made absolutely zero demands of you,

20:52.685 --> 20:54.085
you selfish English prick?

20:54.087 --> 20:55.453
Ouch.

20:57.890 --> 21:01.192
But that aside, it was
my longest relationship.

21:01.194 --> 21:04.595
Granted, it was long-distance,

21:04.597 --> 21:08.866
but I could always count on Kirsten to
be there when I came back to the States.

21:11.404 --> 21:13.971
I guess that's over now.

21:13.973 --> 21:15.740
And that's a good thing.

21:15.742 --> 21:18.609
What... I'm... what?
Why is that a good thing?

21:20.313 --> 21:22.680
'Cause it got me in here
working out and I ran into you.

21:24.217 --> 21:26.017
You're rather easy to talk to.

21:27.553 --> 21:29.720
And real sweaty.

21:29.722 --> 21:31.122
Does that do it for you?

21:31.124 --> 21:33.057
I'm really glad we ran into each other.

21:35.295 --> 21:38.029
I gotta go. I got to go.

21:43.903 --> 21:45.636
Seriously, how do you
not like <i> Torchwood?</i>

21:45.638 --> 21:47.605
I like it well enough.

21:47.607 --> 21:49.573
- Well enough?
- Okay.

21:49.575 --> 21:52.943
I just don't think captain Jack was a
deserving character for a spin-off.

21:52.945 --> 21:54.679
Oh, no, no, no, don't. Just do not.

21:54.681 --> 21:57.148
Captain Jack Harkness
is hella compelling,

21:57.150 --> 21:59.183
and a dreamboat, and he is bi.

21:59.185 --> 22:01.152
- (Laughing)
- He is basically the whole package.

22:01.154 --> 22:02.486
You can't hate on the captain.

22:02.488 --> 22:04.922
Okay, well, I guess we're just
gonna have to agree to disagree.

22:04.924 --> 22:05.990
I guess we are.

22:09.128 --> 22:10.428
More wine?

22:12.131 --> 22:13.531
I shouldn't.

22:13.533 --> 22:16.367
It's getting late. I should go.

22:16.369 --> 22:18.369
Yeah. I guess you should.

22:21.474 --> 22:22.973
I'll drive you.

22:22.975 --> 22:25.015
- You don't have to.
- Good, 'cause I don't want to.

22:26.279 --> 22:28.779
Because then you wouldn't
be here anymore.

22:28.781 --> 22:30.081
So...

22:43.529 --> 22:45.396
Say that captain Jack rules
and I'll stay.

22:45.398 --> 22:47.465
I'll go get my car keys.

22:47.467 --> 22:49.367
Close enough.

24:03.376 --> 24:05.576
(Knocking)

24:05.578 --> 24:07.845
Rise and shine, cupcake!

24:09.949 --> 24:14.218
I hate it when people wake
me before my alarm goes off.

24:14.220 --> 24:16.053
More than you hate being late for work?

24:19.592 --> 24:21.959
(Gasps) Oh, it's 9:20,
why didn't you wake me?

24:21.961 --> 24:25.062
Oh, this must be what it feels like to
be the mother of an ungrateful child.

24:25.064 --> 24:28.199
Oh, sorry. I'm sorry. I must
have just not set my alarm.

24:31.103 --> 24:32.136
What?

24:32.138 --> 24:33.671
There something you're not telling me?

24:37.510 --> 24:39.610
Um, no. No, no, no.

24:39.612 --> 24:42.947
Just, last night I heard a noise,

24:42.949 --> 24:45.649
and so I went to check on it, um...

24:45.651 --> 24:47.785
But there was nothing there
so don't worry.

24:47.787 --> 24:49.987
- (Phone ringing)
- It was fine. Nothing to worry about.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.956
Um, hey, Linus.

24:51.958 --> 24:55.626
<i>Hey, it's almost 9:30,
where are you guys?</i>

24:55.628 --> 24:57.027
Kirsten: I'm sorry, I'm running late.

24:57.029 --> 24:58.796
Well, get here as soon as you can.

24:58.798 --> 25:01.665
I think I've isolated the barrier
you ran into in Sandy's stitch.

25:01.667 --> 25:03.734
Okay, good.

25:05.872 --> 25:07.671
Well, I should get dressed.

25:07.673 --> 25:10.908
Mm-hmm. And wash your feet.

25:13.980 --> 25:15.646
Here's the barrier
I mapped in Sandy's memory.

25:15.648 --> 25:18.983
It shows reduced activity in parts
of the brain's default mode network

25:18.985 --> 25:22.887
together with increased activity in
the prefrontal tensional systems,

25:22.889 --> 25:24.889
- fascinating.
- Thank you, Mr. Spock.

25:24.891 --> 25:26.457
We agreed, I'm kirk, you're Spock.

25:26.459 --> 25:27.525
I never agreed to that.

25:28.661 --> 25:29.693
- Boys.
- Right, sorry.

25:29.695 --> 25:32.062
This indicates the barrier
Kirsten ran into is

25:32.064 --> 25:34.365
a doorway to a distinct
form of consciousness

25:34.367 --> 25:36.867
which is embedded behind
Sandy's everyday consciousness.

25:36.869 --> 25:39.570
Embedded? As in deliberately placed?

25:39.572 --> 25:42.540
I think so. That is a focused
and absorbed attentional state.

25:42.542 --> 25:44.742
Pull up Ben Spiros'
brain scan from the hospital.

25:47.313 --> 25:48.646
Yup. See, same anomaly.

25:48.648 --> 25:53.250
Sandy Abrams and Ben Spiros both
had their minds manipulated.

25:53.252 --> 25:55.553
They were brainwashed
by this Kim person?

25:55.555 --> 25:57.087
But brainwashed to do what?

26:01.527 --> 26:02.760
Any luck tracking down Kim?

26:02.762 --> 26:03.928
We know she rented the apartment

26:03.930 --> 26:05.529
across the way from Ben and Sandy,

26:05.531 --> 26:07.598
paid for it in cash,
and she takes care of everything

26:07.600 --> 26:09.066
through phone calls and couriers,

26:09.068 --> 26:11.702
but now that we know what
the barrier in Sandy's mind is,

26:11.704 --> 26:13.704
we can drop you in behind it
to see what Kim put Sandy up to.

26:13.706 --> 26:15.673
Have you told Cameron
about your hobbit feet?

26:15.675 --> 26:17.341
- Bah! Hobbit feet?
- It was nothing.

26:17.343 --> 26:18.576
I... I went outside to check on a noise

26:18.578 --> 26:20.110
and I forgot to wipe
the dirt off my feet.

26:20.112 --> 26:22.179
Oh, thank God. I thought you
meant hobbit feet as in hairy.

26:22.204 --> 26:23.445
Yeah, you've seen my feet.

26:23.469 --> 26:24.783
- Did they suddenly sprout?
- Nn...

26:24.784 --> 26:25.783
- Mm.
- (Chiming)

26:25.785 --> 26:28.686
Oh. Time it goes to work, my precious.

26:28.688 --> 26:29.753
- (Chiming)
- Oh, God.

26:33.059 --> 26:34.091
Why'd you tell him?

26:34.093 --> 26:35.559
Why didn't you?

26:35.561 --> 26:37.861
We both know you have no idea
what happened last night.

26:37.863 --> 26:39.797
I must have been sleepwalking.

26:39.799 --> 26:41.632
Look, once when I was a kid,
I walked around the block,

26:41.634 --> 26:44.702
and I got back in bed without
even knowing that it happened.

26:44.704 --> 26:45.769
It's... it's not a big deal.

26:45.771 --> 26:46.937
But it might be a big deal.

26:46.939 --> 26:48.806
The truth is you don't know.

26:51.744 --> 26:55.312
Look, if I red flag this to Cameron,

26:55.314 --> 26:56.780
he won't let me stitch,

26:56.782 --> 26:58.716
and I can't jeopardize
the chance of finding out

26:58.718 --> 27:00.551
if my father's connected to it all.

27:02.421 --> 27:04.288
- Please.
- Fine.

27:04.290 --> 27:06.724
But if your brain goes kablooey,
don't come crying to me.

27:08.160 --> 27:09.994
Cameron: Induce stitch
neurosync on my mark.

27:09.996 --> 27:11.662
Three, two, one!

27:14.500 --> 27:15.799
How'd I do? Where'd I drop ya?

27:15.801 --> 27:16.801
No idea.

27:25.911 --> 27:27.678
Sandy's assembling a gun.

27:27.680 --> 27:29.246
She seems to be prepping for something.

27:29.248 --> 27:30.347
Any sign of Kim?

27:31.917 --> 27:33.517
No.

27:49.635 --> 27:50.668
(Exhales)

27:50.670 --> 27:52.870
Sandy was programmed to be an assassin.

27:52.872 --> 27:54.438
Her target?

27:54.440 --> 27:56.373
I didn't recognize his photo,
but it was from a magazine cover

27:56.375 --> 27:58.509
cover that read
"horror has a new master."

27:58.511 --> 27:59.810
Linus and Cameron: Roman Bain.

27:59.812 --> 28:01.445
The movie producer?

28:01.447 --> 28:02.846
Perhaps you've all heard of a small,

28:02.848 --> 28:06.717
$200 million grossing movie
called <i> pig slaughter 3?</i>

28:06.719 --> 28:09.853
Really? No? It was a big hit.

28:09.855 --> 28:12.289
Anyway, Bain was so tough and
proud of the enemies he made.

28:12.291 --> 28:13.724
I... I got it. Look.

28:13.726 --> 28:15.325
Roman Bain was sued last year

28:15.327 --> 28:16.694
for stealing the idea for a film.

28:16.696 --> 28:18.796
A film about brainwashing.

28:18.798 --> 28:19.963
Well, who sued him?

28:19.965 --> 28:21.865
A woman named Kim Charles.

28:21.867 --> 28:23.834
- K.C.
- Right.

28:23.836 --> 28:25.569
So she claimed she was former MI6,

28:25.571 --> 28:27.905
she pitched him an idea
based on her own experience

28:27.907 --> 28:30.140
brainwashing people and
turning them into assassins.

28:30.142 --> 28:32.543
He claimed it was impossible
and then stole her idea.

28:32.545 --> 28:34.311
Let me guess, she lost the lawsuit?

28:34.313 --> 28:36.814
Yep, and then Sandy booked
a role in the film

28:36.816 --> 28:39.083
Bain's currently shooting.
Kim must have found out

28:39.085 --> 28:40.918
and wanted to use Sandy to kill Bain.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.820
Okay, I'll have Fisher find Kim Charles.

28:42.822 --> 28:45.723
She went to a lot of trouble
turning Sandy into an assassin.

28:45.725 --> 28:48.158
If I was her, I'd have backup ready.

28:48.160 --> 28:51.095
She did, and he pushed Sandy off a roof.

28:51.097 --> 28:53.764
Brainwashing isn't an exact science.

28:53.766 --> 28:55.899
You know, and it's possible
his programming went haywire.

28:55.901 --> 28:57.901
Well, Kim must have
activated someone else.

28:57.903 --> 28:59.903
We need to warn Bain.

28:59.905 --> 29:01.672
(Alarm rings)

29:01.674 --> 29:03.874
You know how many death threats I get?

29:03.876 --> 29:06.210
Some people, they don't like
when the villain lives.

29:06.212 --> 29:07.878
I mean, who doesn't like it
when he dies?

29:07.880 --> 29:11.081
Think your life is being threatened
over a dead, fictional character?

29:11.083 --> 29:12.349
I once had a fan who tweeted

29:12.351 --> 29:13.917
that he hoped a certain
body part of mine,

29:13.919 --> 29:16.120
one which I'm particularly
fond of, would fall off.

29:16.122 --> 29:18.455
If I'm not getting two to three
death threats a week,

29:18.457 --> 29:19.623
I'm doing something wrong.

29:19.625 --> 29:21.458
We're not talking
about some Internet troll

29:21.460 --> 29:22.693
hiding behind a screen name.

29:22.695 --> 29:24.495
No, we're talking about Kim Charles.

29:26.465 --> 29:28.966
Kim Charles? What, the whack job?

29:28.968 --> 29:31.568
No, Kim Charles, the former MI6 agent

29:31.570 --> 29:33.704
who sued you for stealing
her brainwashing idea.

29:33.706 --> 29:35.572
That's ridiculous.
She made up the whole story.

29:35.574 --> 29:38.375
Then why'd you announce a movie
about brainwashing right after?

29:38.377 --> 29:40.778
Because I came up with
a better story than hers.

29:40.780 --> 29:42.780
Kim Charles is nuts.
Look, if that woman could do

29:42.782 --> 29:45.048
half the things that she claims
she could, well, I'd be shocked.

29:45.050 --> 29:49.419
Maybe, but still, we strongly
suggest you get extra security

29:49.421 --> 29:50.788
on the lot and take some precautions.

29:50.790 --> 29:52.823
At least until the NSA
does a full threat assessment.

29:52.825 --> 29:53.924
(Chuckles)

29:53.926 --> 29:55.959
You see all these people?

29:55.961 --> 29:57.227
Most of them hate me.

29:57.229 --> 30:01.098
So you wanna do
a full threat assessment?

30:01.100 --> 30:02.866
You're gonna be here for a long time.

30:06.839 --> 30:09.106
(Dreamy music playing)

30:09.108 --> 30:11.175
Call me crazy, but this music sucks.

30:11.177 --> 30:13.243
That's because it isn't music.

30:13.245 --> 30:15.179
Here, look at this.

30:15.181 --> 30:17.815
Even tone on top is
acting like a carrier

30:17.817 --> 30:19.316
for the messed up tone on the bottom.

30:19.318 --> 30:20.565
It's a coded message.

30:20.589 --> 30:22.126
That makes sense.
I mean, Ben was wigging out

30:22.151 --> 30:23.654
when he played it for Camille and me.

30:23.656 --> 30:25.255
And there's gotta be an activation code.

30:25.257 --> 30:26.356
Good job, Linus.

30:26.358 --> 30:28.025
Thanks.

30:28.027 --> 30:29.660
Hey, um, off topic,

30:29.662 --> 30:32.029
but have you noticed anything
different about Camille?

30:32.031 --> 30:33.297
Not that I could tell. Why?

30:33.299 --> 30:34.965
She just seems to be backing off again.

30:34.967 --> 30:37.501
- Sorry, man.
- I just don't get it!

30:37.503 --> 30:38.969
I mean, things were going good.

30:38.971 --> 30:40.270
- Ah, let's face it.
- (Elevator dings)

30:40.272 --> 30:43.040
Women are a lot harder
to read than sine waves.

30:43.042 --> 30:45.042
Hey, welcome back.

30:45.044 --> 30:46.944
What was it like meeting Roman Bain?

30:46.946 --> 30:49.880
Well, I need a shower
to get the sleaze off of me.

30:49.882 --> 30:52.182
He's not taking the threat seriously.

30:52.184 --> 30:53.884
Says that Kim Charles was a phony,

30:53.886 --> 30:55.385
made up her whole story.

30:56.889 --> 30:57.955
What is that?

30:57.957 --> 30:59.990
Oh, it's meditation music.

30:59.992 --> 31:00.991
Don't you feel more peaceful?

31:00.993 --> 31:02.125
Fisher: No, not really.

31:06.131 --> 31:08.365
Kirsten? Kirsten?

31:11.003 --> 31:13.303
So what do we do?

31:13.305 --> 31:15.639
Well, Maggie's gonna talk to
the head of security on the lot,

31:15.641 --> 31:17.574
see if there's a way for us to talk...

31:17.576 --> 31:19.576
- whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Kirsten, what are you doing?

31:19.578 --> 31:21.645
Kirsten, put the gun down.

31:21.647 --> 31:23.413
Come on, Kirsten.

31:27.887 --> 31:28.927
Kirsten, put the gun down.

31:29.989 --> 31:31.054
Hey, hey, hey.

31:37.997 --> 31:39.062
Kirsten.

31:40.933 --> 31:42.366
(Keyboard clicking)

31:42.368 --> 31:44.101
(Whirring, beep)

31:44.103 --> 31:45.903
- (Keyboard clicking)
- (Beep)

31:50.542 --> 31:51.909
Kirsten.

31:53.913 --> 31:54.912
Kirsten!

31:54.914 --> 31:56.013
(Ding)

32:01.086 --> 32:02.419
What the hell just happened?

32:02.421 --> 32:04.521
She jammed the system!
I can't stop the elevator!

32:04.523 --> 32:06.189
She must have inherited
Sandy's brainwashing

32:06.191 --> 32:07.291
when she stitched in.

32:07.293 --> 32:09.259
Oh, no. It's worse than that.

32:10.429 --> 32:11.929
Kirsten just got activated.

32:26.211 --> 32:28.078
A watched pot never boils.

32:28.080 --> 32:29.613
Actually it does,

32:29.615 --> 32:31.648
and it's far less excruciating
than waiting for you

32:31.650 --> 32:34.051
to figure out where the hell
Kim Charles is hiding!

32:34.053 --> 32:36.887
She was MI6, you were CIA.

32:36.889 --> 32:39.489
If you wanted to go dark, would
someone like me be able to find you?

32:39.491 --> 32:40.557
No.

32:40.559 --> 32:42.559
So, cut me some slack.

32:42.561 --> 32:44.461
(Beeping)

32:44.463 --> 32:46.063
Camille, talk to us.

32:46.065 --> 32:47.397
Kirsten's not here.

32:47.399 --> 32:49.299
<i>Well, can you tell
if she's been back at all?</i>

32:49.301 --> 32:51.468
She hasn't. Any luck finding Kim?

32:51.470 --> 32:52.903
- (Beep)
<i>- No.</i>

32:52.905 --> 32:54.071
- (Beep)
- (Sighs)

32:55.341 --> 32:57.140
I'm worried about her.

32:58.077 --> 33:00.344
If you tell anyone, I'll hurt you.

33:00.346 --> 33:01.678
And you taught me how.

33:06.852 --> 33:08.251
We'll find her.

33:08.253 --> 33:09.519
(Sighs)

33:09.521 --> 33:11.521
She wasn't at my place.

33:11.523 --> 33:12.789
(Sighs) Means she's in the wind.

33:12.791 --> 33:14.758
We have to find her
before she hurts someone.

33:14.760 --> 33:16.026
Is Bain under protection?

33:16.028 --> 33:17.527
He won't let us and I can't tell him

33:17.529 --> 33:19.830
how we know
without divulging the program.

33:19.832 --> 33:21.031
If we're gonna save Kirsten,

33:21.033 --> 33:22.332
we're gonna have to
handle this on our own.

33:22.334 --> 33:24.267
Bain, Bain's home, Bain's...

33:24.269 --> 33:26.036
no, that's not where
Kirsten's gonna strike.

33:26.038 --> 33:28.005
Okay, Sandy was programmed

33:28.007 --> 33:29.940
to attack Bain while acting in his film.

33:29.942 --> 33:31.675
If Kirsten inherited
the same programing,

33:31.677 --> 33:34.177
she won't strike anywhere
other than the studio.

33:34.179 --> 33:35.879
She'll wait it out till tomorrow.

33:39.451 --> 33:42.285
<i>(Rock music playing)</i>

33:53.032 --> 33:55.165
(Laughter)

33:55.167 --> 33:56.199
Oh, man.

33:58.003 --> 33:59.136
Hey, yo, check it out.

33:59.138 --> 34:00.537
Let me see that.

34:00.539 --> 34:01.805
Want a hit?

34:05.177 --> 34:06.676
(Chuckles) You just got dissed, bro.

34:06.678 --> 34:08.210
Nah, she wants to party.

34:08.213 --> 34:09.980
Oh! (Grunts)

34:09.982 --> 34:11.114
Bitch! (Grunts)

34:15.353 --> 34:16.820
(Grunting)

34:18.223 --> 34:19.489
(Both breathing heavily)

34:22.428 --> 34:24.127
Come on, let's get out of here!

34:31.103 --> 34:32.369
You two spread out.

34:32.371 --> 34:34.771
If you get eyes on Kirsten,
radio for backup.

34:36.608 --> 34:38.275
Bain: More.

34:38.277 --> 34:41.078
- More green ooze about the edges.
- Okay.

34:41.080 --> 34:43.112
Mr. Bain, I need a minute.

34:43.114 --> 34:44.181
Who are you?

34:44.183 --> 34:46.917
I'm Agent Maggie Baptiste.
I'm with the NSA.

34:46.918 --> 34:48.685
- We spoke last night.
- Right.

34:48.687 --> 34:50.286
Somebody wants me dead.

34:50.289 --> 34:53.090
I am almost certain there will be
an attempt on your life today.

34:53.092 --> 34:54.623
I'd like to get you to a safe location.

34:54.626 --> 34:56.259
When you're totally certain,

34:56.261 --> 34:58.528
come on back and me and you can talk.

35:08.907 --> 35:10.774
I got eyes on Kirsten.
She's headed for Bain.

35:12.277 --> 35:13.376
(Shell clattering)

35:13.378 --> 35:15.145
(Screaming)

35:21.220 --> 35:22.886
Hey, stretch. It's me.

35:22.888 --> 35:25.288
I'd really like it
if you didn't pull that trigger.

35:35.334 --> 35:36.600
Just take it easy, Kirsten.

35:36.602 --> 35:38.068
Okay? You don't want to shoot anyone.

35:38.070 --> 35:40.337
Just stay with me, okay?

35:40.339 --> 35:42.172
Right here. Hey! Right...

35:42.174 --> 35:44.007
Right here.

35:44.009 --> 35:45.675
Okay? It's just us.

35:45.677 --> 35:47.010
Look.

35:51.683 --> 35:53.783
Okay. You're being controlled
by someone, Kirsten, all right?

35:53.785 --> 35:56.319
And that is something
Kirsten Clark does not allow.

35:56.321 --> 35:57.921
Ever.

35:57.923 --> 35:59.489
Come on, stretch.

36:01.126 --> 36:02.659
Remember what you told me?

36:02.661 --> 36:04.261
You told me not to wait for you.

36:04.263 --> 36:06.329
Well, that... that's exactly
what I'm gonna do, all right?

36:06.331 --> 36:08.665
I'm gonna wait right here
as long as it takes

36:08.667 --> 36:10.567
until you're able to
break free from this, okay?

36:12.304 --> 36:13.603
I know you can hear me.

36:14.540 --> 36:16.373
And I know how strong
your mind is, okay?

36:16.375 --> 36:19.743
It's one of the strongest minds
that I have ever met.

36:22.481 --> 36:24.548
Remember when I died for you?

36:27.386 --> 36:28.685
Well, I'm willing to do that again,

36:28.687 --> 36:31.021
except this time, you won't
be able to bring me back.

36:36.395 --> 36:37.894
Now, come on, stretch.

36:39.164 --> 36:40.630
You still got work to do.

36:40.632 --> 36:42.599
Make the bounce.

36:46.338 --> 36:47.338
Kirsten?

36:53.312 --> 36:55.312
(Breathes heavily) I'm okay.

37:01.153 --> 37:02.385
I'm okay.

37:05.424 --> 37:06.489
Gun!

37:06.491 --> 37:07.657
- (Gunshot)
- (Shell clatters)

37:07.659 --> 37:08.992
(Overlapping chatter)

37:16.168 --> 37:17.367
- Cameron, get her out of here.
- Okay.

37:17.369 --> 37:20.237
Whoa, whoa, no, no!
I want that woman arrested!

37:20.239 --> 37:22.239
You mean the woman who
just saved your life?

37:30.749 --> 37:32.015
Hey.

37:33.085 --> 37:34.284
- Drink this.
- I'm fine.

37:34.286 --> 37:35.585
You're not fine.

37:35.587 --> 37:38.421
Been in your shoes more than once.

37:38.423 --> 37:39.623
Trust me, it helps.

37:42.027 --> 37:43.326
That's not just tea.

37:44.396 --> 37:47.797
No. Some situations require
more than just tea.

37:52.371 --> 37:54.371
Like when you shoot your first person?

37:54.373 --> 37:56.439
You didn't have a choice.

37:56.441 --> 37:57.607
You did the right thing.

37:57.609 --> 37:58.775
At least you didn't kill her.

37:58.777 --> 38:00.844
She's lucky you aren't a better shot.

38:02.481 --> 38:04.814
How did she know
about the Stitchers program?

38:04.816 --> 38:05.915
She didn't.

38:05.917 --> 38:07.450
But when you showed up on her doorstep

38:07.452 --> 38:09.386
in the middle of the night,
she realized that

38:09.388 --> 38:12.455
you somehow had inherited
Sandy's programming,

38:12.457 --> 38:14.924
and her MI6 training wasn't
about to let that go to waste.

38:14.926 --> 38:18.461
I was so convinced it was Stinger.

38:19.598 --> 38:20.930
That's too bad.

38:20.932 --> 38:22.599
What?

38:22.601 --> 38:25.368
I was hoping that letter
was meant for you.

38:26.605 --> 38:28.905
It would help you get closer
to finding your father.

38:36.948 --> 38:38.782
Mm.

38:38.784 --> 38:39.849
Mm!

38:43.021 --> 38:44.354
Hey.

38:44.356 --> 38:46.022
How you feeling?

38:46.024 --> 38:48.325
Okay. Why don't you tell me?

38:48.327 --> 38:50.593
Well, your brain scan came back clean.

38:50.595 --> 38:52.929
There's no trace
of Kim's mind manipulation left.

38:52.931 --> 38:54.431
Good.

38:56.435 --> 38:59.469
Thank you for what you did
at the studio.

38:59.471 --> 39:02.205
How did you know that I'd snap out of it

39:02.207 --> 39:03.673
and not shoot you?

39:03.675 --> 39:04.974
I didn't.

39:04.976 --> 39:08.378
But we've been in each other's minds.

39:08.380 --> 39:10.080
I know you better than you think.

39:12.551 --> 39:14.017
Hey, uh...

39:15.120 --> 39:16.686
Do you wanna do something tonight?

39:17.689 --> 39:19.456
Um...

39:22.160 --> 39:23.493
I can't.

39:23.495 --> 39:24.894
Okay. That's okay.

39:24.896 --> 39:27.063
Uh... another time.

39:27.065 --> 39:28.164
Sure.

39:28.166 --> 39:29.532
Bye.

39:38.810 --> 39:40.543
Hey!

39:40.545 --> 39:41.878
You wanna hang out tonight?

39:41.880 --> 39:43.847
Mm... no, I'm tired.

39:43.849 --> 39:45.482
I think I'm just gonna crash.

39:45.484 --> 39:47.183
Oh. We can crash together.

39:47.185 --> 39:49.552
Uh, I've got a 1,000 thread count
pillow with your name on it.

39:49.554 --> 39:51.388
Oh, Camille. I'm glad I caught you.

39:51.390 --> 39:52.822
- Do you have a minute?
- Yeah! Um...

39:52.824 --> 39:54.724
Go. I'll talk to you tomorrow.

39:56.762 --> 39:58.061
(Clears throat)

40:03.435 --> 40:05.268
So tell me. How's it going?

40:05.270 --> 40:07.504
Good. On schedule.

40:07.506 --> 40:09.773
Does he have any idea?

40:09.775 --> 40:13.042
No. Liam believes my joining
his gym was a coincidence.

40:13.044 --> 40:14.544
And Linus?

40:14.546 --> 40:17.046
He, I think, suspects something.

40:17.048 --> 40:18.381
I hate lying to him.

40:18.383 --> 40:20.216
Well, the less he knows,
the safer he is.

40:20.218 --> 40:22.585
You're not lying to him.
You're protecting him.

40:22.587 --> 40:23.720
Yes. I know that.

40:23.722 --> 40:25.522
I just don't think he'd see it that way.

40:25.524 --> 40:27.056
Liam Granger is a soft target.

40:27.058 --> 40:28.425
I need to find out what his role is

40:28.427 --> 40:29.926
and who he's playing for.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.795
Have you been able to gain his trust?

40:31.797 --> 40:34.564
Yeah, I think he's taking the bait.

40:34.566 --> 40:36.099
Okay.

40:36.101 --> 40:38.535
Wait. Maggie, um...

40:38.537 --> 40:40.703
How far do I go with this?

40:41.907 --> 40:44.207
How far are you willing to go
to protect Kirsten?

40:54.252 --> 40:55.652
(Knocking)

41:00.492 --> 41:01.558
Hey.

41:02.794 --> 41:03.893
So what's up?

41:03.895 --> 41:05.161
I've got some good news

41:05.163 --> 41:06.729
and bad news about Elizabeth Stinger.

41:06.731 --> 41:08.131
I'm listening.

41:08.133 --> 41:10.800
Can I come in or you gonna
take my gun from me again?

41:10.802 --> 41:13.503
(Sighs) Uh, depends on the news.

41:13.505 --> 41:15.371
Come in.

41:17.909 --> 41:20.643
The good news,
Elizabeth Stinger got remarried

41:20.645 --> 41:22.579
and changed her name to Elizabeth Brown.

41:22.581 --> 41:24.414
Do you have a number for her?

41:24.416 --> 41:27.450
That's the bad news.
There are over 250 listings

41:27.452 --> 41:29.185
in California alone under that name.

41:29.187 --> 41:31.354
(Sighs) Oh.

41:33.492 --> 41:34.991
How soon can you get them all to me?
