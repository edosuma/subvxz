This is not a good idea.
you're my student.

00:05.272 --> 00:08.641
- i really thought you were
gonna kiss me just then.

00:08.692 --> 00:11.777
- i've never stepped outside
of my marriage before.

00:11.912 --> 00:15.498
- i am flattered, but i--i'm...

00:15.532 --> 00:17.500
- what? were you just gonna
leave me behind?

00:17.534 --> 00:19.051
- the gods have seen fit

00:19.086 --> 00:21.087
To give me another shot
at the soul mate.

00:21.588 --> 00:22.654
I gotta be ready for her.

00:22.672 --> 00:23.672

bangin'

00:25.008 --> 00:27.325

[high pitch] motherfucker!

00:27.343 --> 00:29.294
- you wanted to see me,
professor moody?

00:29.328 --> 00:31.163
- look, here's the thing--
- oh, my god.

00:31.181 --> 00:32.497
You're trying to end this thing.

00:32.515 --> 00:34.633
- i've been doing some thinking.
- yeah. me, too.

00:34.817 --> 00:36.118
- so look, here's the thing.

00:36.152 --> 00:37.786

00:41.791 --> 00:42.758
- i beg your pardon?

00:42.792 --> 00:43.876
- fine, i'll do it.

00:43.927 --> 00:46.011
You want to throw

01:05.197 --> 01:06.782
We'll start small,
we'll take it from there.

01:06.816 --> 01:09.284
See how you feel.
no pressure...

01:09.319 --> 01:11.036
Unless you want to see
my ? schween ?

01:11.070 --> 01:12.871
Because i will totally unfurl
for you.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.373
I'm not shy.

01:14.407 --> 01:17.993
- stop it. your daughter
could walk in any second.

01:18.027 --> 01:20.045
- oh, that's impossible.

01:20.079 --> 01:22.414
- it's unlikely,
but it's not impossible,

01:22.465 --> 01:25.000
And i'm convinced she does not
want to see your...

01:25.034 --> 01:26.201
? schween ?

01:26.219 --> 01:28.203
- oh, why you gotta
talk to me like that?

01:28.221 --> 01:31.974
Besides, there's like
0.0% chance of that happening.

01:32.008 --> 01:33.225
She's not even on the premises.

01:33.259 --> 01:35.344
- where is she?

01:35.378 --> 01:36.895
- huh?

01:36.930 --> 01:38.180
- where is she?

01:38.214 --> 01:41.316
- oh. she went down
to the liquor store for me.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.652
Uh, what? oh, i hear
the front door.

01:43.686 --> 01:45.070
We're gonna have
to skype you later.

01:45.104 --> 01:48.323
- do not hang up. hey!
- honey, you're pixelating.

01:48.358 --> 01:49.741
- listen, she's with them,
right?

01:49.776 --> 01:50.742
- what?

01:50.777 --> 01:52.661
- she's with them.
- them?

01:52.695 --> 01:54.079
They're not an alien race

Bent on intergalactic

01:55.999 --> 01:58.450
- well, how do you know that?
do you have proof?

01:58.501 --> 01:59.734
- no, but you're right.

01:59.752 --> 02:01.069
Maybe i should
check the grounds.

02:01.087 --> 02:03.288
Perhaps there's
some sort of portal

02:03.339 --> 02:04.756
Somewhere in the topiary.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.174

02:12.015 --> 02:14.716

you kind of broke the spell.

02:14.750 --> 02:16.718
You know, you blew it.

02:16.752 --> 02:18.553
- you were agin it when you
thought she was in her bedroom,

02:18.587 --> 02:19.855
And you're agin it now
you think

02:19.889 --> 02:21.440
She's spending the night
with the tudors.

02:21.474 --> 02:25.444
I can't win with you, woman.

That's it. oh.

There you go.
oh, yeah, come on.

02:34.570 --> 02:39.741
Whoa, oh! god damn you,
that's unfair,

It's not like you wanted

I'm trying to be a good boy,
you know?

05:02.602 --> 05:04.769

what's so good about it.

of perfectly lovely

05:09.108 --> 05:11.759

05:11.777 --> 05:13.478
What you were celebrating
last night anyway.

05:13.529 --> 05:16.815
- oh, yeah, that.
my last dance.

05:16.866 --> 05:18.900
I'm done.

05:18.934 --> 05:20.152
- with what?

05:20.203 --> 05:21.486
- the stripping.

05:21.537 --> 05:23.738
- oh, wow, you don't say.

05:23.772 --> 05:24.873
Really?

05:24.907 --> 05:26.291
- yep. i'm out.

05:26.325 --> 05:29.161
No more grinding up
on middle-aged hard-ons for me,

05:29.212 --> 05:30.912
Except for yours, of course.

05:30.946 --> 05:32.797
- who you calling middle aged?

05:32.832 --> 05:35.783
- you, my old dude boyfriend.

05:35.801 --> 05:39.287
- oh, stop it.
you're gonna make me blush.

05:39.305 --> 05:41.139
So what is next for you?

05:41.174 --> 05:42.257
- writing.

05:42.291 --> 05:43.758
I'm gonna give it a shot.

05:43.792 --> 05:46.261
I mean, fuck, it's what
makes me the happiest, right?

05:46.295 --> 05:49.147
Who cares if i die poor,
drunk, and alone?

05:49.182 --> 05:50.632
- well, who's to say

05:50.650 --> 05:52.684
That you're not gonna end up
like that anyway?

05:52.735 --> 05:56.821
- mm. well, thank you
for showing me the light, teach.

05:56.856 --> 05:59.824
- well, it's been my pleasure
and an honor.

05:59.859 --> 06:02.143
Just happy
that my half-baked wisdom

06:02.161 --> 06:04.112
Could assist you
in any way...

06:04.146 --> 06:06.314
- oh, no.

06:06.332 --> 06:08.816
Don't tell me you're trying
to break up with me again.

06:08.834 --> 06:10.585
- well,
to be fair and balanced

06:10.620 --> 06:12.420
The term "breaking up" implies

06:12.455 --> 06:15.156
That once upon a time,
we were together.

06:15.174 --> 06:18.426
- okay, so then,
just to be clear,

06:18.461 --> 06:20.545
The sheer amount
of no-holds-barred sex

06:20.596 --> 06:23.181
That we've been having recently
does not indicate

06:23.216 --> 06:24.883
A certain level
of intimacy.

06:24.934 --> 06:30.004
- sure. sure, it does.
what's your point?

06:30.022 --> 06:31.773
- god, for someone who loves
women so much,

06:31.807 --> 06:34.025
You sure don't understand them
very well.

- oh. [laughs]
- it's really just more

06:39.515 --> 06:41.483
Of a rite of passage
for you.

06:41.517 --> 06:45.570

06:47.790 --> 06:49.407
- oh.
- even my old lady had one,

06:49.458 --> 06:51.493
And it used to bum me out,
but now i get it.

06:51.527 --> 06:53.861
It's like she was fucking me
before she met me.

07:13.349 --> 07:14.382

07:14.400 --> 07:17.435
- tell her i said hi.
- i will not.

we chill 'em.

07:19.655 --> 07:21.773

to school okay?

07:21.824 --> 07:23.692
- one would hope. jesus.

07:23.726 --> 07:25.076
- well, that's
not very comforting.

07:25.111 --> 07:27.078
- oh, well, you know,
the peoples of the dean,

07:27.113 --> 07:28.196
They are many things,

07:28.230 --> 07:29.748
But not punctual
is not one of them.

07:29.782 --> 07:30.749
Don't worry so much.

07:30.783 --> 07:32.033
- i tried to check in with her.

07:32.067 --> 07:34.402
I texted,
i checked her twitter page.

07:34.420 --> 07:36.204
I got nothing.
i mean, no response.

07:36.238 --> 07:38.173
- duh, we're ruining her life,
remember?

07:38.207 --> 07:40.074
Or maybe it's game day
for the crimson tide.

07:40.092 --> 07:41.960
You know how edgy you get
when aunt flo's in town.

07:42.011 --> 07:44.045
- hank, are you trying
to piss me off?

07:44.079 --> 07:46.914
- you see?
is it arts and crafts week

07:46.932 --> 07:49.217
At panty camp for you, too?

07:49.251 --> 07:51.303
- hank!
- what was that?

07:51.354 --> 07:52.304
- [mouthing words]

07:52.355 --> 07:53.305
- uh, what was what?

07:53.356 --> 07:54.806
- someone just said "hank."

07:54.857 --> 07:57.475
- no, that was, uh,
the cleaning lady.

07:57.526 --> 07:58.693
The cleaning lady, that was.

07:58.728 --> 08:01.763
- oh, so since when did we have
a cleaning lady?

08:01.781 --> 08:03.865
- uh, soon. recently.

08:03.899 --> 08:05.567
She doesn't appear
to be dusting.

08:05.601 --> 08:06.901
The place is a mess.

08:06.935 --> 08:08.370
You saw that shit.
it's fucked up.

08:08.404 --> 08:09.821
I gotta go.

08:09.872 --> 08:12.106
- what the fuck is this?
- she won't wake up.

08:12.124 --> 08:13.274
- shitness. is she dead?

08:13.292 --> 08:14.492
- i don't know.

why's he being such a douche?

09:01.657 --> 09:03.925
- yes, i remember now,
but can we reschedule?

09:03.959 --> 09:05.827
I've got a comatose stripper

09:18.507 --> 09:20.892
Nothing like the sound
of a stripper's head

09:20.943 --> 09:22.193
On a hardwood floor.

09:22.228 --> 09:23.845
- what the fuck
is wrong with you?

09:23.863 --> 09:26.114
- what?
oh, you don't rough 'em up?

09:26.148 --> 09:28.149
Oh, excuse me,

09:48.804 --> 09:51.890
Charlie, could you get
this girl out of here for me?

09:51.924 --> 09:53.808
- i don't know, hank.
this is kind of dirty business.

09:53.843 --> 09:55.727
You know, it's
a little shady for me.

09:55.761 --> 09:57.679
- when was the last time i asked
you to do something for me?

09:57.713 --> 09:59.514
- what are you talking about?
i got you those reservations

09:59.548 --> 10:01.048
You wanted that time
at mr. chow's.

10:01.066 --> 10:03.050
- yes, you did,
spring of 2003.

10:03.068 --> 10:04.886
I remember. i was still
with karen back then.

10:04.904 --> 10:05.987
- you think that shit
is easy, hank?

10:06.021 --> 10:07.071
You try it sometime.

10:07.106 --> 10:08.890
Restaurant people
can be very dismissive.

10:08.908 --> 10:11.526
- okay, all right, all right.
here's how it's gonna go.

10:11.560 --> 10:12.861
Me and rick, we're gonna
take her to the e.r.,

10:12.895 --> 10:14.946
See what's what.
we'll leave your name our of it.

10:14.997 --> 10:17.699
And while we're there,
we should really look into

10:17.733 --> 10:18.900
Why you're shitting
so much blood.

10:18.918 --> 10:20.535
Let's go.

10:21.837 --> 10:24.456
Easy does it, easy does it.

10:24.507 --> 10:26.674
- [grunting]

10:26.709 --> 10:28.075
- narrow doorway.

10:28.093 --> 10:29.544
Safety first.

10:29.578 --> 10:31.212
- hey, you're rick springfield,
aren't you?

10:31.246 --> 10:32.680
- that's right, tiny dancer.

10:32.715 --> 10:33.798
Hey, you look
kind of familiar.

10:33.849 --> 10:34.883
You ever shake
your ass for me?

10:34.917 --> 10:37.251
- no, but my mom did,
back in the day.

10:37.269 --> 10:39.103
I think you guys boned.

10:39.138 --> 10:40.939
- right on. she say good things
about my big ten-inch?

10:40.973 --> 10:43.090
- she said you refused
to put a rubber on it.

10:43.108 --> 10:44.442
- that's right, baby.
skin on skin,

10:44.477 --> 10:46.027
Let the love begin.
[thud]

10:46.061 --> 10:48.596
- oh, hey, watch what the fuck
you're doing, rick springfield.

10:50.149 --> 10:53.284
- you know what? i've just
about had it with this guy

10:53.319 --> 10:55.036
And his snotty fucking comments.

10:55.070 --> 10:57.572
I will fuck you
till your ass bleeds, cowboy.

10:57.606 --> 10:59.273
- thank god,
'cause i don't think

10:59.291 --> 11:01.042
That's gonna take very long.

11:01.076 --> 11:02.043
[knock at door]

11:02.077 --> 11:03.077
Fuck!

11:05.280 --> 11:06.748
Really?

11:08.417 --> 11:09.801
Shit.

11:15.808 --> 11:17.675
- i know you're in there,
hank moody.

11:17.726 --> 11:21.012
I heard the footsteps.
open up.

11:24.600 --> 11:27.468
- get in the bedroom.
back in the bedroom.

11:36.478 --> 11:37.612
Jilly!

11:37.646 --> 11:39.480
- [laughs] good morning.

11:39.498 --> 11:42.650
- good mor--just stopping by,
huh? look at you.

11:42.668 --> 11:44.836
- yeah, i figured i'd catch you
before you left for work.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.320
- caught me you did.
- uh-huh.

11:46.338 --> 11:47.488
- you caught me.
- yeah.

11:47.506 --> 11:48.790
It's a pretty safe bet,

11:48.824 --> 11:50.458
Considering
you're almost always late.

11:50.492 --> 11:51.459
- [laughing]

11:51.493 --> 11:52.827
- you gonna invite me in,
or what?

11:52.845 --> 11:55.496
- [laughs]

11:55.514 --> 11:56.831
I have something
i want to tell you.

11:56.849 --> 11:58.332
I have news, really big news.
- okay, all right,

11:58.350 --> 11:59.384
But can it wait?

11:59.435 --> 12:01.019
I was just about to jump
in the shower.

12:01.053 --> 12:03.021
- oh, perfect.
i'll join you,

12:03.055 --> 12:04.389
And tell you in there.
- no, no, no.

12:04.440 --> 12:06.107
I thought we agreed to stop
those kind of shenanigans

12:06.141 --> 12:07.525
For now.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.310
- yeah, but that's what i want
to talk to you about.

12:09.344 --> 12:10.845
- okay. well, i'm gonna
grab some coffee.

12:10.863 --> 12:12.614
Would you like some coffee?
'cause i'm gonna grab--

12:12.648 --> 12:13.898
- ah, not so much.

12:13.949 --> 12:15.567
I just brushed
and had a couple of altoids.

12:15.618 --> 12:16.985
- oh, nice, but i'd like a cup.

12:17.019 --> 12:19.120
- all right.
go on, go on,

12:19.154 --> 12:21.289
And then just meet me
in the boudoir when you get it.

12:21.323 --> 12:23.291
- no, no!
don't go in there.

12:23.325 --> 12:24.358
- why?

12:24.376 --> 12:26.578
- just please don't.

12:26.629 --> 12:29.664
- oh, my god, do you have
a fucking girl in there?

12:29.698 --> 12:32.083
- give a guy some credit.

12:32.134 --> 12:36.888
Maybe he just laid down
some serious wolf bait.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.723
I just took
my morning dump.

12:38.757 --> 12:40.308
It reeks
to high heaven in there.

12:40.342 --> 12:42.209
- lovely.
- yeah, it was.

12:42.227 --> 12:43.428
An almost
perfect bowel movement,

12:43.479 --> 12:45.229
Clean as a whistle,
barely had to wipe.

12:45.264 --> 12:47.732
- but you did, right?

12:47.766 --> 12:50.051
- i'm not a fucking animal.
of course i did.

12:50.069 --> 12:52.720
What was it that you wanted
to talk about, doll?

12:52.738 --> 12:54.322
- okay, i've been doing
some thinking.

12:54.356 --> 12:55.657
- oh, you mean
some over-thinking.

12:55.691 --> 12:58.242
- [laughs] shut up, you.

12:58.277 --> 13:00.528
- you!
- yes?

13:00.562 --> 13:01.562
- i accept you.

13:01.580 --> 13:03.698
- what?

13:03.732 --> 13:06.034
- [laughs] no, i accept you
for who you are.

13:06.068 --> 13:09.370
- oh, you accept me.
thanks, i guess.

13:09.404 --> 13:11.506
- you're not listening, stupid.
- i'm listening.

13:11.540 --> 13:12.707
- i accept you for who you are.

13:12.741 --> 13:15.009
I don't want to change you.

13:15.044 --> 13:17.045
[coffee maker beeps]

13:17.079 --> 13:19.263
I think we work well
together, you know?

13:19.298 --> 13:20.515
Kid or no kid,

13:20.549 --> 13:23.217
Snip or no snip,
i want to be with you.

13:23.251 --> 13:25.252
I think i spent years
idolizing--

13:25.270 --> 13:26.587
- sure you
don't want some coffee?

13:26.605 --> 13:28.756
- no. i think i was in love
with the idea of love.

13:28.774 --> 13:30.224
- tea?
- no, thanks.

13:30.258 --> 13:32.060
I like what we have.

13:32.094 --> 13:33.478
- are you hungry?

13:33.529 --> 13:37.949
- no, but now i know
that i'm in love with you.

13:37.983 --> 13:40.201
I'm in love with you,
hank moody.

13:40.235 --> 13:42.620
- [laughs] oh, jill.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.122
[jill laughing]

13:44.156 --> 13:46.124
- this--it's wo--but--

13:46.158 --> 13:50.044
- no, don't "but" me.
don't "but" me now.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.279
- ho!

13:52.297 --> 13:55.383
- yeah, or i just might
butt you back.

13:55.417 --> 13:57.001
[knock at door]

13:57.052 --> 14:01.956
- fuck! okay, you hold
that very naked thought.

14:04.343 --> 14:05.677
- yeah.

14:13.268 --> 14:16.404
? who is it? ?
- it's felicia.

14:16.438 --> 14:17.855
- felicia? fuck.

14:17.906 --> 14:19.440
- fuck, yeah. you'll be cool?

14:19.474 --> 14:21.308
- okay.
- all right.

14:21.326 --> 14:23.528
Stay in there.
- oh!

14:23.579 --> 14:25.446
Whoo!

14:30.669 --> 14:33.004
- good morning.
- good morning to you.

14:33.038 --> 14:35.673
- [sighs] i can't stop
thinking about it.

14:35.708 --> 14:36.924
- what?

14:36.959 --> 14:39.260
Oh. oh, that.

14:39.294 --> 14:41.162
Mm, you liked that, did you?

14:41.180 --> 14:42.513
- i did.

14:42.548 --> 14:45.800
That was some very intense
and powerful love-making, hank.

14:45.834 --> 14:48.136
- mmm.

14:48.170 --> 14:49.637
- what's wrong?

14:49.671 --> 14:51.172
- not a big fan
of that term--

14:51.190 --> 14:52.673
Love-making, making love.

14:52.691 --> 14:56.644
I prefer boning, stuffing,
schtupping, banging,

14:56.678 --> 14:58.563
Porking, boffing.

14:58.614 --> 14:59.847
[smacking lips]

14:59.865 --> 15:02.400
Anything, take your pick,
just not love-making.

15:02.451 --> 15:04.318
- so much for the afterglow.

15:04.352 --> 15:08.122
- all right, so what can i do
for you this a.m.?

15:08.157 --> 15:10.524
- i told him.

15:10.542 --> 15:12.827
- him?

15:12.861 --> 15:15.830
Fuck. please tell me
that by "him"

15:15.864 --> 15:16.998
You mean your therapist?

15:17.032 --> 15:19.200
- no such luck, i'm afraid.

15:19.218 --> 15:22.303
- felicia, why on earth would
you do something like that?

15:22.337 --> 15:23.721
- he knew, hank.

15:23.756 --> 15:27.425
He saw it in my face--
the pure joy, the glow

15:27.476 --> 15:29.894
Of a freshly fucked
and properly tended-to woman.

15:29.928 --> 15:31.763
So i told him.
i came clean.

15:31.814 --> 15:33.598
It felt so good.

15:33.649 --> 15:35.183
It was the right thing to do.

15:35.217 --> 15:36.684
- jesus fuck.

15:36.718 --> 15:39.720
- jesus fuck is right.
guess what?

15:39.738 --> 15:41.489
- what?

15:41.523 --> 15:42.690
- i'm leaving him.

15:42.724 --> 15:44.525
- oh, no!
oh, no, you're not!

15:44.559 --> 15:47.411
- yes, i am. stacy and i
don't make sense anymore.

15:47.446 --> 15:48.996
We haven't
for quite some time now.

15:49.031 --> 15:50.832
And i was thinking,
life is short.

15:50.866 --> 15:52.834
Fuck it. i want to spend
the rest of my days

15:52.868 --> 15:54.235
With someone
i feel passionate about,

15:54.253 --> 15:55.837
Someone who gives me
butterflies,

15:55.871 --> 15:58.339
And for better or for worse,
hank, that someone is you.

15:58.373 --> 16:00.842
- whoa, whoa, whoa, just
slow the fuck down, felicia.

16:00.876 --> 16:02.243
One session of love-making,

16:02.261 --> 16:03.961
Now matter how inspired
or transcendent,

16:04.012 --> 16:06.097
Does not a relationship make.
what about the chelsea?

16:06.131 --> 16:07.215
- what about her?

16:07.249 --> 16:08.933
- i don't care
how bratty or snotty

16:08.967 --> 16:10.084
That little shit is.

16:10.102 --> 16:11.385
She doesn't deserve
a broken home.

16:11.419 --> 16:12.687
- oh, she'll get over it.

16:12.721 --> 16:14.188
Becca's clearly weathered
the storm.

16:14.223 --> 16:16.858
- no, she hasn't. she's totally
fucked up, that kid.

16:16.892 --> 16:18.359
Karen and i made
a huge mistake.

16:18.393 --> 16:20.394
We should have stayed together
at all costs for her.

16:20.428 --> 16:22.780
But we were stubborn,
and we were foolish,

16:22.815 --> 16:24.782
And retarded, we were young.
- why don't you just shut up

16:24.817 --> 16:26.534
And make love
to me already?

16:26.568 --> 16:31.289
Or you can fuck me, bang me,
stuff me. take your pick.

16:33.742 --> 16:34.909
Who's that?

16:34.943 --> 16:38.996
- that'd be my agent,
my representation.

16:39.047 --> 16:41.949
Charlie runkle,
felicia koons.

16:41.967 --> 16:44.468
- oh, hey, hey, hey,
the dean's wife.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.087
- mm-hmm.
- oh, shit.

16:46.121 --> 16:47.471
Nice to meet you, missus.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.257
- lovely to meet you.

16:54.146 --> 16:56.314
- so where were we?

16:56.348 --> 16:58.766
- i was leaving
my husband for you.

17:01.970 --> 17:03.688
- hold on a second.

17:09.493 --> 17:10.994
- whoo-hoo!

17:11.029 --> 17:13.664
- [laughing]

17:13.699 --> 17:16.534
Hey, come on, man,
you want to get in on this?

17:16.585 --> 17:18.085
- you guys are fucking foul.

17:18.119 --> 17:19.921
- you sure?
we got an open hole.

17:19.954 --> 17:22.540
- sweetheart, you okay?

17:22.590 --> 17:24.175
- don't worry.
they're paying for it...

17:24.209 --> 17:25.675
Handsomely.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.595
<i>- well, i'm paying for it
very handsomely.</i>

17:27.628 --> 17:28.846
- hey, i left my wallet at home.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.548
Don't be such a fucking
schnorr, runkle.

17:30.599 --> 17:31.832
Jesus. i'm losing my wood.

17:31.850 --> 17:33.500
Come on, say it, baby,
say it.

17:33.518 --> 17:36.270
- i'm getting fucked
by rick springfield.

17:36.305 --> 17:37.504
[springfield laughing]

17:37.522 --> 17:41.359
? you better love somebody ?
whoo!

17:41.393 --> 17:45.363
? oh, i think
you better love somebody ?

17:45.397 --> 17:47.448
- you okay out here?
what are you doing?

17:47.482 --> 17:48.816
- what does it look like?

17:48.850 --> 17:51.369
- oh, that? i got
an apartment full of classics,

17:51.403 --> 17:52.787
And you gotta go
with that one?

17:52.821 --> 17:54.739
- what's the big deal?
i've heard good things.

17:54.790 --> 17:57.325
- yeah? well, what do you think?
thoughts, criticisms?

17:57.359 --> 17:58.525
What do you got?

17:58.543 --> 18:00.795
- i like it a lot.
she's a good writer.

18:00.829 --> 18:02.964
My kind of girl obviously.

18:02.998 --> 18:05.199
So, uh, can we leave yet?

18:05.217 --> 18:07.752
- uh, no, i still got
some fires to put out.

18:07.803 --> 18:10.704
- okay. are you proud of me
for quitting?

18:10.722 --> 18:12.340
- absolutely.

18:12.374 --> 18:13.841
You done good, kiddo.

18:13.875 --> 18:15.393
- thanks.

18:15.427 --> 18:17.378
Hey, don't think we're done

18:17.396 --> 18:19.546
With the boyfriend/girlfriend
conversation just yet.

18:29.358 --> 18:30.391
- hello, hank.

18:33.228 --> 18:34.495
- morning, stacy.

18:34.529 --> 18:36.080
- the front door was open.

18:36.114 --> 18:39.834
- oh, i can be
very neighborly that way.

18:39.868 --> 18:41.235
- you never called me
stacy before.

18:41.253 --> 18:42.420
Wonder why.

18:42.454 --> 18:43.754
- i don't know.
just kind of rolled

18:43.789 --> 18:45.206
Trippingly off the tongue
this morning.

18:45.240 --> 18:46.757
- oh, something
must be different.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.542
Oh, that's right.
you fucked my wife.

18:48.576 --> 18:52.246
- okay. well, there's that.

18:52.264 --> 18:53.580
- what could you say?

18:53.598 --> 18:55.466
What could you
possibly say, hank,

18:55.517 --> 18:58.853
To take away the hurt
and the pain of being cuckolded?

19:00.973 --> 19:03.307
- i got nothin'.
i got nothin' at all.

19:03.358 --> 19:06.811
Uh, i'm sorry.
the well is dry.

19:06.862 --> 19:08.479
I think you should hit me.
you want to hit me?

19:08.530 --> 19:10.781
Head, gut--it doesn't matter.
it's only fair.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.599
- no, i don't want
to hit you, hank.

19:12.617 --> 19:14.785
I just want to try
to understand, how do you do it?

19:14.820 --> 19:16.103
- do what?

19:16.121 --> 19:19.156
- well, you obviously
have this--this--

19:19.207 --> 19:22.543
This thing with women,
some very strong connection,

19:22.577 --> 19:23.911
That no matter what you do,

19:23.945 --> 19:25.913
No matter how big
of an ass you are,

19:25.947 --> 19:28.716
They seem to respond.
you're a goddamn girl whisperer.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.284
- okay.

19:30.302 --> 19:32.619
Have you listened
to your wife lately?

19:32.637 --> 19:34.221
- have you? because she gives
every indication

19:34.256 --> 19:35.289
Of being a woman scorned.

19:35.307 --> 19:36.474
Now, far be it from me

19:36.508 --> 19:37.975
To poke my nose
into the dean's business,

19:38.010 --> 19:41.345
But it seems to me
like you hurt her first.

19:41.396 --> 19:43.848
- you're right, i did.

19:43.899 --> 19:45.266
I was weak. i cheated.

19:45.300 --> 19:47.685
- well...
- stepped outside my marriage.

19:47.736 --> 19:49.470
Humiliated my better half.

19:49.488 --> 19:50.988
- it happens.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.774
- but she was so hot, hank,
this student of mine.

19:53.808 --> 19:55.642
You should have seen her.
- dean-o.

19:55.660 --> 19:57.278
- a priest would have
defiled this girl.

19:57.312 --> 19:58.612
- wow. well,
you might want to keep

19:58.646 --> 20:00.331
Those kind of details
to yourself.

20:00.365 --> 20:02.533
- oh, felicia is wonderful.

20:02.584 --> 20:05.286
A beautiful wife,
a beautiful mother.

20:05.320 --> 20:06.287
I was in love with her

20:06.321 --> 20:07.671
The first moment
i set eyes on her.

20:07.706 --> 20:08.839
I knew she was the one.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.758
She was always a little reserved
in the sack.

20:10.792 --> 20:12.543
The british, you know.
- yeah.

20:12.594 --> 20:14.328
- there was never a surplus
of oral,

20:14.346 --> 20:17.348
And whatever there was dried up
right after the wedding.

20:17.382 --> 20:19.350
- okay.
- i never understood that.

20:19.384 --> 20:20.634
- yeah. here you go.

20:20.668 --> 20:22.103
- a man likes to get
his dick sucked.

20:22.137 --> 20:23.387
Well, you know.

20:23.438 --> 20:26.474
- maybe if you took a goddamn
shower once in a while.

20:26.508 --> 20:28.526
Do you really think a woman
wants to go down on a man

20:28.560 --> 20:30.194
Who just walked in
off the tennis court?

20:30.228 --> 20:32.179
Or just came in
from a ride, huh?

20:32.197 --> 20:34.782
You think i want to peel off
those sweaty bike shorts

20:34.816 --> 20:36.617
And go to town? disgusting!

20:36.651 --> 20:39.703
- i'm sorry, felicia,
but that just so happens to be

20:39.738 --> 20:41.655
When this man
is at his horniest.

20:41.689 --> 20:42.689
You know that.

20:42.707 --> 20:44.291
- have you heard
of compromise, stacy?

20:44.326 --> 20:46.127
- compromise--i like
where this is going.

20:46.161 --> 20:48.379
- divorce court--
that's where this is going.

20:48.413 --> 20:49.914
- hey, what are you
doing here anyway?

20:49.965 --> 20:51.999
A free pass means once--
no repeat business.

20:52.033 --> 20:53.867
And we're gonna be discussing
this in therapy.

20:53.885 --> 20:55.553
Just you watch.
- that's an excellent idea.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.221
Therapize the fuck
out of this shit.

20:57.255 --> 20:58.556
- and you're coming
with us, hank.

20:58.590 --> 21:00.541
<i>- oh, that's an awful idea.
- it is awful.</i>

21:00.559 --> 21:01.675
Do you know
how much of my life

21:01.709 --> 21:03.210
I've wasted on that couch
pretending

21:03.228 --> 21:04.711
We can just jabber
through our issues?

21:04.729 --> 21:07.481
No more, stacy. no more.

21:07.516 --> 21:09.316
I'm in love with someone else.

21:09.351 --> 21:11.385
- yee...

21:11.403 --> 21:13.654
- are you in love
with my wife, hank?

21:16.658 --> 21:18.659
- that's a ridiculous question.

21:18.693 --> 21:20.561
- well, she seems to be
in love with you.

21:20.579 --> 21:21.996
Do you feel the same?

21:22.030 --> 21:25.399
- feel the same?

21:25.417 --> 21:27.168
- do you love her?

21:31.072 --> 21:33.574
[door thuds]

21:33.592 --> 21:35.676
- [laughs]

21:35.710 --> 21:37.094
What do we have here?

21:37.129 --> 21:38.929
- what are you doing home?

21:38.964 --> 21:41.081
- uh, school closed?
what is it, a snow day?

21:41.099 --> 21:42.216
- what are you guys
doing here?

21:42.250 --> 21:43.684
- i believe that question

21:43.718 --> 21:45.252
Should be directed at you,
young lady.

21:45.270 --> 21:46.637
- copy that, motherfucker.

21:46.688 --> 21:48.939
- i left one of my books here.
i needed it.

21:48.974 --> 21:51.108
- well,
you could have called me.

21:51.143 --> 21:52.526
I would have brought it to you.

21:52.561 --> 21:54.228
You know what? i'm gonna
take you right back to school

21:54.262 --> 21:55.596
Right now,
you little guttersnipe.

21:55.614 --> 21:56.730
No more
of your double-talk.

21:56.764 --> 21:58.232
I'm taking your lying,
no-account ass

21:58.266 --> 21:59.533
Back to school, pronto.
come on.

21:59.568 --> 22:01.702
- excellent idea, what he said.
let's go, chelsea.

22:01.736 --> 22:03.270
- no, wait a second.
why are you guys here?

22:03.288 --> 22:05.623
- actually,
we were chatting about you.

22:05.657 --> 22:07.825
- that's right, we were talking
about your offensive behaviors,

22:07.876 --> 22:09.276
Which apparently seem now

22:09.294 --> 22:11.545
To be not so unjustified,
do they?

22:11.580 --> 22:13.831
Hey, becca. becca?

22:19.120 --> 22:21.589
- dad?
- yes, daughter?

22:21.623 --> 22:25.309
- why is there a naked lady
in my bedroom?

22:25.343 --> 22:26.627
Is that my kimono?

22:26.645 --> 22:27.928
[chelsea laughs]
- yeah.

22:27.962 --> 22:29.296
- way to go, hank.

22:29.314 --> 22:30.464
- oh, my god.

22:30.482 --> 22:32.966
Were you sleeping
with your t.a.

22:32.984 --> 22:34.652
The whole time
you were sleeping with me?

22:34.686 --> 22:36.136
- what? mom!

22:36.154 --> 22:37.855
- well, to be fair,
it was only the once.

22:37.906 --> 22:38.939
- bullshit.

22:38.973 --> 22:41.275
- no, i was referring
to flea and i.

22:41.309 --> 22:42.476
- i counted three times.

22:42.494 --> 22:43.994
- all in one night
doesn't count.

22:44.029 --> 22:47.248
- your dad's
fucking my mom.

22:47.282 --> 22:48.666
Dad, anything to say
about this?

22:48.700 --> 22:50.651
- i think this calls
for a family meeting.

22:50.669 --> 22:51.752
- good thinking.
- oh, anyway?

22:51.786 --> 22:53.420
[smoke alarm beeping]
- what is it?

22:53.455 --> 22:54.622
- oh, whoa! oh!

22:54.656 --> 22:56.957
- oh, boy.
- oh, my god!

22:56.991 --> 22:58.209
- [muttering]

22:58.260 --> 23:00.961
- what the fuck?
is that rick springfield?

23:00.995 --> 23:02.963
- you bet your khaki-clad ass,
white man.

23:02.997 --> 23:05.683
- oh, holy shit.
- you a fan?

23:05.717 --> 23:07.685
- where the fuck's that
fire extinguisher, runkle?

23:07.719 --> 23:09.853
- hey, what's up, sweetheart?

23:09.888 --> 23:11.355
- sorry.

23:11.389 --> 23:13.224
- oh, you have got
to be shitting me.

23:13.275 --> 23:15.559
Please tell me you have not been
fucking her this entire time.

23:15.610 --> 23:17.895
- hey, whoa, whoa, whoa,
not in front of the children.

23:17.946 --> 23:19.697
And not last night, i didn't.
i was being good.

23:19.731 --> 23:21.482
I was an officer
and a gentleman. you tell her.

23:21.516 --> 23:22.983
- are these my pants?

23:23.017 --> 23:25.786
- wait, who else
has he been fucking?

23:25.820 --> 23:27.020
You?

23:27.038 --> 23:28.355
Oh, gross.

23:28.373 --> 23:31.125
- sorry, man, i just...
- so you, too, then?

23:31.159 --> 23:33.294
- god, no. thanks.
he's just fucking my mom.

23:33.328 --> 23:35.028
- chelsea, watch your mouth.

23:35.046 --> 23:36.914
- dad, seriously, man up
and grow a pair already.

23:36.965 --> 23:38.799
You're gonna let this asshole
steal your wife?

23:38.833 --> 23:41.201
- hey! that's my father
you're talking about.

23:41.219 --> 23:42.536
- thank you, becca.

23:42.554 --> 23:44.054
- i really can't believe
i quit stripping for you.

23:44.089 --> 23:45.706
- i still think
it's a solid move.

23:45.724 --> 23:47.141
Now, if you'll all excuse me,

23:47.175 --> 23:51.145
I appear to have
an actual fire to put out.

23:51.179 --> 23:53.013
- sorry about that, dude.

23:53.047 --> 23:54.148
- that's rick springfield.

24:02.490 --> 24:05.159
[fire alarm beeping]

24:15.337 --> 24:16.370
- okay.

24:16.404 --> 24:19.006
- [moaning]

24:36.975 --> 24:39.393
- come on, honey, we should
really get you to school.

24:39.427 --> 24:42.196
- i can't believe you slept
with all of them.

24:42.230 --> 24:44.431
- it's not that simple,
sweetheart.

24:44.449 --> 24:45.932
- all of them.

24:45.950 --> 24:49.770
- yes, i suppose i did.
yeah.

24:49.788 --> 24:50.954
- why?

24:50.989 --> 24:53.240
- i don't know.
i don't know.

24:53.274 --> 24:56.377
- that's not good enough.
i want to know why.

24:56.411 --> 24:57.795
There has to be a reason.

24:57.829 --> 24:59.279
Make me understand.

25:01.800 --> 25:03.083
- it just sort of happened.

25:03.117 --> 25:04.802
- why do you do things
like that?

25:04.836 --> 25:08.305
- because i'm an idiot,
obviously.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.758
- no, you're not allowed
to feel sorry for yourself,

25:10.792 --> 25:12.760
Not right now.

25:12.794 --> 25:14.595
You need to talk to me.

25:14.629 --> 25:17.648
You need to tell me
why you do the things you do

25:17.682 --> 25:20.818
When you know that people
can get seriously hurt,

25:20.852 --> 25:22.436
Myself included.

25:22.470 --> 25:26.824
- god damn it, i hate it
when you're mad at me.

25:26.858 --> 25:28.275
- i'm not mad at you.

25:28.309 --> 25:30.778
You wouldn't get mad
at a big, dumb dog

25:30.812 --> 25:32.529
For shitting on the rug,
would you?

25:32.580 --> 25:34.248
- i would,
but i'm a harsh taskmaster.

25:34.282 --> 25:35.416
That's just me.

25:35.450 --> 25:37.284
- what do you want me
to take away from this,

25:37.318 --> 25:38.419
From how you treat women?

25:38.453 --> 25:39.620
- oh, jesus.

25:39.654 --> 25:42.339
- is that all they are to you,
walking vaginas?

25:47.712 --> 25:51.265
- there's no excuse
for my behavior.

25:51.299 --> 25:54.718
There's no defense if somebody
got hurt, especially you.

25:54.769 --> 25:56.603
But i need you to know
that i started out

25:56.638 --> 25:58.004
With the best of intentions.

25:58.022 --> 26:02.393
I guess i just wanted
them all to see it,

26:02.444 --> 26:05.946
The thing
that makes them special.

26:05.980 --> 26:07.948
I guess that's all anybody wants
is to be seen,

26:07.982 --> 26:11.351
To be recognized.

26:11.369 --> 26:12.703
Then the lines get blurry,

26:12.737 --> 26:18.075
And the fact that your mom and i
are in such a weird place.

26:18.126 --> 26:22.212
Yeah. hence,
the big stinking mess.

26:24.382 --> 26:26.834
But i'm sorry
if i let you down, sweetie,

26:26.868 --> 26:29.553
And i don't know
how much more

26:29.587 --> 26:30.971
I'm gonna be able
to say i'm sorry

26:31.005 --> 26:34.541
Before it doesn't mean anything
anymore.

26:34.559 --> 26:38.429
- i don't know, either.

26:38.480 --> 26:41.047
But i have this funny feeling
we're gonna find out.

26:41.065 --> 26:43.049
[telephone ringing]

26:50.057 --> 26:52.192
- hey, honey.

26:52.226 --> 26:55.729
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
she's, uh, at school...

26:55.747 --> 26:58.415
Receiving her education.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.000
Mm-hmm. yeah,
i'm gonna pick her up

27:00.034 --> 27:03.454
And take her to get
some ice cream,

27:03.505 --> 27:05.672
Shoot the shit,
bridge the gap,

27:05.707 --> 27:08.342
Just like old times.
mm-hmm. yeah.

27:11.262 --> 27:13.597
Well, i love you, too.

27:13.631 --> 27:17.351
Skype you later?
all right.

27:21.422 --> 27:25.392
- ? oh, soul, all i want ?
- where are my fucking clothes?

27:25.426 --> 27:28.061
- ? is freedom ?
