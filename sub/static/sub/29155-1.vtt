00:53.703 --> 00:55.302
<i>My doctor, Dr. Edwards,</i>

00:55.304 --> 00:58.372
<i>told me everything I know
about Grandpa's illness.</i>

00:58.374 --> 00:59.905
<i>Grandpa has Alzheimer's.</i>

00:59.907 --> 01:02.109
<i>People with Alzheimer's
forget a lot of stuff.</i>

01:02.111 --> 01:05.512
<i>I mean, I forget to do my
homework, or brush my teeth,</i>

01:05.513 --> 01:07.513
<i>but with my grandpa,
it's different.</i>

01:07.515 --> 01:09.182
<i>He forgets
pretty much everything.</i>

01:09.184 --> 01:10.950
<i>My parents want
to put him in a home,</i>

01:10.952 --> 01:13.219
<i>but that's just gonna
make things worse.</i>

01:13.221 --> 01:16.555
<i>So, I'm taking him on a trip
to Venice to make him better.</i>

01:16.557 --> 01:18.191
<i>He remembers loads
about Venice,</i>

01:18.193 --> 01:20.192
<i>even though
it's been like 100 years</i>

01:20.194 --> 01:22.596
<i>since he and Grandma
went on their honeymoon there.</i>

01:22.598 --> 01:23.930
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

01:23.932 --> 01:25.632
Me and Grandpa are
having a great time.

01:25.634 --> 01:28.402
And I brought my inhaler,
so don't freak out.

01:28.404 --> 01:31.471
We're having breakfast on the
train, actually, right now.

01:33.708 --> 01:35.641
Grandpa, do you
wanna say something?

01:35.643 --> 01:37.547
- Who to?
- Mom and Dad.

01:38.848 --> 01:39.882
Hello?

01:40.815 --> 01:42.551
We're having a great time.

01:44.051 --> 01:46.153
No one's there.
Poop on them.

01:46.155 --> 01:48.721
Yeah. Poop on them.
See you tomorrow.

01:48.723 --> 01:50.224
Or maybe the day after.

01:50.226 --> 01:51.290
- Love you.
- Bye!

01:51.292 --> 01:52.494
Bye!

02:01.136 --> 02:02.201
Where are you going?

02:02.203 --> 02:03.403
To the john.

02:03.405 --> 02:04.639
Okay.

02:40.643 --> 02:42.374
Oh, shit! Grandpa!

03:12.406 --> 03:13.608
Grandpa!

03:16.210 --> 03:19.281
<i>That's us.
My Grandpa Amadeus and me.</i>

03:20.948 --> 03:24.017
<i>I think I get why Grandpa
is the way he is.</i>

03:24.019 --> 03:28.188
<i>Mom and Dad spend their whole life
thinking about what might happen</i>

03:28.190 --> 03:31.224
<i>at work,
to the new house, to me,</i>

03:31.226 --> 03:34.827
<i>or going over
and over the past.</i>

03:34.829 --> 03:39.968
<i>But sometimes it's just best to
focus on what's going on right now.</i>

03:41.836 --> 03:44.036
<i>It all started
when Grandma died.</i>

03:44.038 --> 03:48.708
Margaret was certainly one of the
most glamorous women in our little community.

03:48.710 --> 03:51.077
Do you think they're
going to burn her?

03:51.079 --> 03:52.244
Who?

03:52.246 --> 03:53.880
Your grandma, silly.

03:53.882 --> 03:55.815
Are you mad? No way.

03:55.817 --> 04:00.055
Okay, then she'll just
get eaten up by worms.

04:01.222 --> 04:02.689
My grandma's in a coffin.

04:02.691 --> 04:05.257
They can chew through coffins.

04:05.259 --> 04:07.361
Sharp little worm teeth.

04:07.363 --> 04:08.428
Yeah.

04:08.430 --> 04:10.366
Can we change the subject?

04:11.966 --> 04:15.469
What's England like?
Did you make new friends?

04:15.471 --> 04:16.737
Not really.

04:16.738 --> 04:18.771
Did you meet the queen?

04:18.773 --> 04:20.005
Yes, I did.

04:20.007 --> 04:23.276
She said to say hi.

04:23.278 --> 04:26.148
Margaret's passing leaves us all
with a huge hole in our hearts.

04:28.249 --> 04:31.286
But as long as a person
lives in our memories,

04:32.520 --> 04:35.521
she's never forgotten.
She is never forgotten.

04:35.523 --> 04:37.125
Amadeus will now
say a few words.

04:54.609 --> 04:56.311
Thank you.

05:02.751 --> 05:04.516
My Maggie

05:04.518 --> 05:06.354
was just wonderful.

05:07.289 --> 05:08.691
She had the biggest heart

05:10.126 --> 05:12.395
and breasts.

05:13.395 --> 05:15.261
Big, beautiful breasts.

05:18.299 --> 05:21.934
She always laughed
at my stupid joy, jokes.

05:21.936 --> 05:23.438
Right up to the end.

05:24.338 --> 05:25.907
What bees make milk?

05:27.475 --> 05:29.345
Boobies.

05:33.015 --> 05:36.014
And I always ate that
apple pie of hers.

05:36.016 --> 05:37.751
You know, the one with

05:37.753 --> 05:42.689
the cinnamon crust
and the squirty cream.

05:42.691 --> 05:44.994
She hadn't made that in years.

05:45.761 --> 05:47.528
I know that.

05:47.530 --> 05:48.860
Actually,

05:48.862 --> 05:51.797
I was never crazy
about that pie.

05:51.799 --> 05:54.169
But I always ate it
when she made it.

05:55.903 --> 05:58.907
Because people
are just creatures.

06:00.441 --> 06:02.408
Creatures of habit.

06:02.410 --> 06:05.345
I would've loved
something different.

06:05.347 --> 06:08.284
Fruit cake, perhaps?
No, no, no.

06:09.984 --> 06:11.684
I don't like fruit cake.

06:11.686 --> 06:13.922
Pecan pie, maybe?

06:15.123 --> 06:17.860
Or, what are they called...
You know, uh...

06:22.364 --> 06:24.030
Cream puffs.

06:24.032 --> 06:27.936
They make the best cream puffs
down at...

06:28.802 --> 06:30.872
The intersection there...

06:32.040 --> 06:34.843
Where the...
It's a new house...

06:38.780 --> 06:41.783
They thingamajigged
the house...

06:43.818 --> 06:46.020
They squeezed it in...

06:47.888 --> 06:50.223
I don't...

06:50.225 --> 06:54.063
They...
Oh, stuff it up your ass.

06:57.398 --> 06:58.900
Stuff it up your ass.

07:02.705 --> 07:06.542
But I'd love a slice
of that pie now.

07:09.544 --> 07:12.311
My darling Elizabeth.

07:12.313 --> 07:13.381
Elizabeth?

07:14.316 --> 07:15.785
It's his mother.

07:16.417 --> 07:17.484
Nick,

07:17.486 --> 07:20.585
one day I hope
you'll find a woman

07:20.587 --> 07:23.458
that's as wonderful as
your mother was for me.

07:31.999 --> 07:34.502
What am I gonna
do without you?

07:54.890 --> 07:57.523
<i>Arrivederci,</i> my love.

07:57.525 --> 07:59.759
<i>Arrivederci.</i>

07:59.761 --> 08:02.164
<i>Arrivederci.</i>

08:09.503 --> 08:10.605
Grandma.

08:13.174 --> 08:15.307
<i>After the funeral,</i>

08:15.309 --> 08:18.311
<i>Dad asked Grandpa if he wanted to
come and live with us in England.</i>

08:18.313 --> 08:23.516
<i>But Grandpa didn't want to. He said
he couldn't leave Grandma all alone.</i>

08:23.518 --> 08:26.321
<i>So, we went back to England
without Grandpa.</i>

08:27.588 --> 08:29.355
<i>But three months later,</i>

08:29.357 --> 08:31.357
<i>Grandpa called</i>

08:31.359 --> 08:34.964
<i>and told Dad that he couldn't remember
the way to the cemetery anymore.</i>

08:37.732 --> 08:39.133
Tildy!

08:40.701 --> 08:43.303
My little <i>principessa!</i>

08:45.739 --> 08:47.408
I'll take that.

08:49.577 --> 08:52.513
I've seen this guy before.

08:53.916 --> 08:55.814
Come on in.

08:55.816 --> 08:58.385
Here. Have a seat right here.

08:58.387 --> 09:01.090
Okay. Okay.

09:04.258 --> 09:06.595
- Would you like a cookie?
- Sure.

09:09.797 --> 09:11.231
Did you take the bus?

09:11.233 --> 09:13.766
No, Grandpa, we live
in England now, remember?

09:13.768 --> 09:16.638
Oh, I know that!
I know that.

09:17.840 --> 09:20.173
- Um, Grandpa...
- Mmm-hmm?

09:20.175 --> 09:22.040
Why do you have
milk in your bookshelves?

09:22.042 --> 09:23.843
No more room
in the dishwasher.

09:28.215 --> 09:30.949
Margaret! Maggie!
Your son is here!

09:30.951 --> 09:32.153
Dad.

09:32.954 --> 09:35.190
Mom's... Mom's not here.

09:36.392 --> 09:37.693
I know that.

09:39.927 --> 09:41.461
Of course.

09:41.463 --> 09:42.464
It's habit.

09:43.831 --> 09:45.698
You looking for something?

09:45.700 --> 09:46.998
Where's Roberta?

09:47.000 --> 09:48.968
- Roberta?
- Your housekeeper.

09:48.970 --> 09:50.306
I fired her.

09:51.806 --> 09:53.241
You fired her?

09:54.142 --> 09:55.674
Why'd you do that?

09:55.676 --> 09:57.142
She was stealing from me.

09:57.144 --> 09:58.243
What did she take?

09:58.245 --> 10:00.079
Your sister's jewelry.

10:00.081 --> 10:02.381
Dad, I don't have a sister.

10:02.383 --> 10:04.549
But you always
wanted one, didn't you?

10:09.425 --> 10:11.660
Is this the jewelry
you're talking about?

10:13.561 --> 10:14.562
It's all there.

10:15.864 --> 10:17.863
Huh.

10:17.865 --> 10:20.301
I'm glad
she brought it all back.

10:23.604 --> 10:24.605
Coffee?

10:30.678 --> 10:32.411
Grandpa,

10:32.413 --> 10:34.481
aren't you supposed to keep
those locked up somewhere?

10:34.483 --> 10:36.616
Honey, if the Russians came

10:36.618 --> 10:39.150
you wouldn't wanna have
your gun locked up.

10:39.152 --> 10:40.620
That's not a real gun.

10:40.622 --> 10:42.356
Watch this.

10:43.892 --> 10:45.094
You got any milk?

10:46.061 --> 10:49.062
Okay. Black, then.

10:49.064 --> 10:50.499
Whoa!

10:55.570 --> 10:57.071
Oh, boy.

11:02.143 --> 11:05.344
Dad!

11:05.346 --> 11:07.713
Have you completely lost your mind?

11:07.715 --> 11:08.716
Give it!

11:13.122 --> 11:15.357
Have you completely
lost your mind?

11:19.927 --> 11:21.229
Where did you get this?

11:22.531 --> 11:25.064
Not at Trader Joe's,
that's for sure.

11:25.066 --> 11:26.698
Honey, are you okay?

11:26.700 --> 11:29.171
- Yeah.
- Oh, brother.

11:32.206 --> 11:33.806
I got an idea.

11:33.808 --> 11:35.708
Why don't you come back
and live with us for a while?

11:35.710 --> 11:37.910
Yay!

11:37.912 --> 11:42.549
Only if you've got something
you want me to do.

11:42.551 --> 11:44.916
There'll be plenty
for you to do.

11:44.918 --> 11:46.385
Right, sweetie?

11:46.387 --> 11:48.354
We can get Grandpa
to help out with the garden.

11:48.356 --> 11:50.256
We just want you back home.

11:50.258 --> 11:52.561
But I need...

11:53.861 --> 11:55.263
I need to take some of my...

11:56.998 --> 11:58.732
- This stuff.
- Yeah.

11:58.734 --> 12:00.099
This.

12:00.101 --> 12:02.434
Dad, you can bring
whatever you want.

12:02.436 --> 12:05.372
I'll arrange a shipping
container or something.

12:05.374 --> 12:09.642
Just... No guns, okay?
No guns.

12:09.644 --> 12:11.577
And Cindy's
okay with this?

12:11.579 --> 12:12.511
Who?

12:12.513 --> 12:15.481
- Your mom.
- Oh, Sarah.

12:15.483 --> 12:18.587
Mom will be okay with it.
I promise.

12:25.726 --> 12:26.859
You've got your own

12:26.861 --> 12:28.928
en-suite bathroom, Amadeus,

12:28.930 --> 12:31.733
and I left some fresh towels
for you on the bed.

12:35.603 --> 12:37.336
And you can walk
to school with me.

12:37.338 --> 12:38.804
I'm right across the hall.

12:38.806 --> 12:41.708
- Where's Jack?
- Jack? Who's Jack?

12:41.710 --> 12:43.074
My dog.

12:43.076 --> 12:46.445
Is he tied up outside?
He doesn't like to be tied up.

12:46.447 --> 12:48.182
Jack died, Amadeus.

12:49.050 --> 12:50.619
Last Christmas, wasn't it?

12:52.586 --> 12:55.154
Here. You can have
Benny instead.

12:55.156 --> 13:00.993
He's really soft. And he doesn't
smell half as bad as Jack did.

13:00.995 --> 13:04.229
Honey, this is ridiculous.
I have to go. I have a meeting.

13:04.231 --> 13:06.031
- I can't miss this.
- No, I'm late.

13:06.033 --> 13:07.467
I've got a pitch
this afternoon.

13:07.469 --> 13:09.035
I'm cutting it really
close as it is.

13:09.037 --> 13:10.904
I cannot miss this meeting.

13:10.906 --> 13:12.604
You promised me you were going to
move to England for my career, right?

13:12.606 --> 13:14.040
- That was the deal.
- Mmm-hmm.

13:14.042 --> 13:15.876
I moved to America for yours,
now it's my turn.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.709
- I can't be late.
- For once.

13:17.711 --> 13:20.246
I have made every school visit since
Tilda was four years old, so...

13:20.248 --> 13:21.780
That's not true.

13:21.782 --> 13:24.483
Yes, it is!
Please don't do this to me.

13:24.485 --> 13:26.519
Please, do not do this
to me. Hi!

13:26.521 --> 13:28.354
Sorry about that. Here we are.

13:28.356 --> 13:30.223
- Here we go.
- No worries. Thank you. Great.

13:30.225 --> 13:32.091
If you just turn
to page four...

13:32.093 --> 13:33.692
- Four.
- Okay.

13:33.694 --> 13:37.796
Obviously, Matilda did
have some issues settling in.

13:37.798 --> 13:39.732
'Cause it was a very big move
for you, wasn't it, Matilda?

13:39.734 --> 13:42.801
I was wondering if you felt
like things were improving.

13:42.803 --> 13:44.871
'Cause I know that you miss your
family in America very much.

13:44.873 --> 13:46.872
Well, she has been
settling in, right?

13:46.874 --> 13:48.674
Yes, definitely.

13:48.676 --> 13:51.209
She's already started saying things
like "bath" instead of "bath."

13:51.211 --> 13:52.477
Thank God.

13:52.479 --> 13:54.146
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

13:54.148 --> 13:55.613
Or you could if you wanted to.

13:55.615 --> 13:59.720
Well, as you can see,
her marks have improved

14:00.422 --> 14:01.753
a little bit.

14:01.755 --> 14:03.589
I'm sorry,
but I've gotta go.

14:03.591 --> 14:06.058
Tilda, darling,
I'll see you later.

14:06.060 --> 14:07.827
I'll take that.

14:07.829 --> 14:09.498
Do you want me to
take this, or do you...

14:15.036 --> 14:17.969
I was wondering how you were
feeling about things, Matilda.

14:17.971 --> 14:19.271
Fine, thanks.

14:19.273 --> 14:20.473
That's wonderful.

14:20.475 --> 14:22.275
So, is there anything else?

14:22.277 --> 14:25.144
I wanted to go over some of
our extracurricular activities

14:25.146 --> 14:28.314
that we offer, because I really
feel that they could help Matilda

14:28.316 --> 14:30.549
cement some of these
new friendships.

14:30.551 --> 14:32.050
Could you e-mail me
the details?

14:32.052 --> 14:33.752
I'm so sorry.

14:33.754 --> 14:35.521
I'm late for a pitch,
which is pretty important, but...

14:35.523 --> 14:38.391
I love you, darling.
Well done. I'll see you later.

14:38.393 --> 14:40.093
Thank you so much,
Missus, um, Miss...

14:40.095 --> 14:42.627
- Seager.
- Seager! Yes, of course! I know that.

14:42.629 --> 14:44.697
We're so thrilled everything
is going brilliantly

14:44.699 --> 14:47.833
and so proud of you,
darling. Okay?

14:47.835 --> 14:49.368
Bye. Thank you. Bye.

14:49.370 --> 14:51.136
<i>My parents work a lot.</i>

14:51.138 --> 14:53.205
<i>Dad works for a bank.</i>

14:53.207 --> 14:56.008
<i>He got a new job in London after
he spent too much time with Penny,</i>

14:56.010 --> 14:57.944
<i>his office manager
in Connecticut.</i>

14:57.946 --> 14:59.978
<i>We went back here
because Mom grew up here</i>

14:59.980 --> 15:01.814
<i>and wanted to be
close to her mom.</i>

15:01.816 --> 15:04.117
<i>Then, Dad found out
that Mom made out</i>

15:04.119 --> 15:06.785
<i>with her new boss
at the Christmas party</i>

15:06.787 --> 15:09.054
<i>because she was still mad
at him about Penny.</i>

15:09.056 --> 15:11.924
<i>Dad got really upset.
But Grandpa just said,</i>

15:11.926 --> 15:14.227
<i>"If the roosters can do
it to the hens</i>

15:14.229 --> 15:16.563
<i>"then the hens can do
it to the roosters."</i>

15:16.565 --> 15:20.198
<i>I guess Dad didn't really agree,
because now he works all the time.</i>

15:22.671 --> 15:24.569
- Yeah.
- Nick. The police just called.

15:24.571 --> 15:26.439
What do you mean,
the police just called?

15:26.441 --> 15:27.839
Your father's with them now.

15:27.841 --> 15:30.108
- Where?
- They're down at the station.

15:30.110 --> 15:31.644
<i>Well, what's he doing there?</i>

15:31.646 --> 15:33.780
- Is he hurt?
- No, no. He's not hurt, he's fine.

15:33.782 --> 15:36.115
- <i>What is it?</i>
- You might want to sit down.

15:36.117 --> 15:37.416
I'm sitting down.

15:37.418 --> 15:39.251
<i>Stop rambling and tell
me what it is.</i>

15:39.253 --> 15:40.953
- What is it?
- I'm not rambling on.

15:40.955 --> 15:43.356
I'm just trying to tell you
what your dad has done, Nick.

15:43.358 --> 15:46.962
- And I'm waiting.
- He's filed a missing persons report...

15:48.162 --> 15:49.431
...for your mother.

15:52.367 --> 15:53.532
That's fine.

15:53.534 --> 15:55.001
- I'm sorry.
- You're good.

15:55.003 --> 15:57.071
I'll just clean it up
real quick.

16:01.341 --> 16:03.977
Hello. Hi.

16:03.979 --> 16:07.011
I'm Mrs. Ross. I've come
to pick up my father-in-law.

16:07.013 --> 16:09.714
The elderly gentleman who
reported his wife is missing.

16:09.716 --> 16:11.752
- Yes.
- Yeah. He gave us this.

16:12.988 --> 16:14.520
Do you know who she is?

16:14.522 --> 16:17.723
Yes, that's my late
mother-in-law, when she was young.

16:17.725 --> 16:19.894
This was supposed to be
her missing persons photo.

16:21.863 --> 16:23.663
Sorry to have
taken up your time.

16:23.665 --> 16:26.399
Can I take him home now?
Thank you. Thank you so much.

16:26.401 --> 16:27.666
Thanks.

16:27.668 --> 16:29.267
Very nice
of you to say that.

16:29.269 --> 16:31.439
Here you are, Amadeus.

16:32.507 --> 16:34.240
That's Maggie.

16:34.242 --> 16:36.775
Isn't she beautiful?

16:36.777 --> 16:39.911
All the boys
were chasing her.

16:39.913 --> 16:42.548
They all wanted to
be with her,

16:42.550 --> 16:45.918
but she chose, well,
she wanted, you know...

16:45.920 --> 16:48.688
You wanted to show your photo
to the policemen?

16:48.690 --> 16:50.957
Why on earth would I do that?

16:50.959 --> 16:52.361
I don't know.
You tell me.

16:53.260 --> 16:56.261
Maybe I wanted to boast a bit.

16:57.999 --> 17:00.266
- Well, you ready to go home now?
- Oh, no.

17:00.268 --> 17:04.270
I don't want to.
I want to stay here with this officer.

17:04.271 --> 17:05.570
She's been really kind.

17:05.573 --> 17:07.740
- She's got a kind face.
- Thank you.

17:07.742 --> 17:11.742
- Yes, she does, but I'm sure she's very busy.
- Thank you.

17:11.744 --> 17:13.744
So, let's get you home.
Come on.

17:13.747 --> 17:14.949
Up you go. Come on.

17:16.150 --> 17:17.249
Thank you so much.

17:17.251 --> 17:19.152
Bye.

17:19.154 --> 17:22.088
One, two, three, four, five.

17:22.089 --> 17:24.723
- And three next time...
- Wait a minute. Hold on. Hold on a second.

17:24.724 --> 17:25.790
- What?
- That's five?

17:25.791 --> 17:27.291
Stop moving my pieces.

17:27.294 --> 17:28.761
- I think that was...
- No! Come on, can you count?

17:28.763 --> 17:31.163
One, two, three,
four, five, thank you!

17:31.165 --> 17:33.366
Okay, just checking.
I know you like to win.

17:33.368 --> 17:35.534
Well, I know you hate to lose,
which in this case,

17:35.536 --> 17:38.070
you're going to, 'cause all I need
is a three next time and I have won.

17:38.072 --> 17:40.609
Again! Here you are.
It's your turn.

17:46.446 --> 17:47.745
Amadeus, hello?

17:47.747 --> 17:49.016
Let him take his time.

17:50.584 --> 17:54.185
I'm just trying to figure
out my next move.

17:54.187 --> 17:55.887
We're not playing chess.

17:55.889 --> 17:57.924
- Just let him figure out his next move, Mom.
- Okay, fine.

17:57.926 --> 17:59.992
Sorry. Carry on.

17:59.994 --> 18:03.996
If I go left, they'll
cut me off here.

18:03.998 --> 18:06.632
That wouldn't be
a good move at all,

18:06.634 --> 18:08.600
but you have a clear run
if you go this way.

18:08.602 --> 18:09.668
You think?

18:09.670 --> 18:11.569
Look, you can't go this way,

18:11.571 --> 18:13.039
you said it yourself.

18:13.041 --> 18:15.139
And you'd be in danger
of getting ambushed

18:15.141 --> 18:17.242
if you went this way.

18:17.244 --> 18:19.544
If you take this route,
you'll be fine.

18:19.546 --> 18:20.748
Thanks!

18:24.551 --> 18:26.053
Seven, eleven.

18:27.388 --> 18:28.988
Oh, dear!

18:28.990 --> 18:31.026
Look what you've done. Oh, no!

18:32.026 --> 18:33.693
Where did it go?

18:33.695 --> 18:35.293
- Wait, where was it?
- This was...

18:35.295 --> 18:37.029
I know, but it's important,
because if we don't...

18:37.031 --> 18:39.065
- So can you put them back where...
- A six!

18:39.067 --> 18:39.932
A six!

18:39.934 --> 18:41.568
- Really?
- Yeah, a six.

18:41.570 --> 18:43.469
- It looks like a six to me.
- Six.

18:43.471 --> 18:46.738
One, two, three,
four, five, six,

18:46.740 --> 18:49.678
seven, eight, nine...

18:50.578 --> 18:51.810
- Ten.
- You see that?

18:51.812 --> 18:53.812
- We got a winner!
- Amadeus!

18:53.814 --> 18:55.647
No. You...
You rolled a six.

18:55.649 --> 18:56.915
- Honey. Honey.
- Mom!

18:56.917 --> 18:58.149
Not a 10.

18:58.151 --> 19:00.118
- Mom!
- What? I'm sorry, but we can't...

19:00.120 --> 19:02.021
There's no point playing unless
we play by the rules. Really!

19:02.023 --> 19:03.923
Why does it upset you
when someone else wins?

19:03.925 --> 19:05.424
Because it's pointless!

19:05.426 --> 19:08.062
Who's in favor of us
playing by Grandpa's rules?

19:09.763 --> 19:11.030
All right.

19:11.032 --> 19:12.801
Ooh! At last!

19:22.010 --> 19:23.376
What is that?

19:23.378 --> 19:25.511
Dad's belongings.

19:25.513 --> 19:27.680
I wanted him
to feel at home here.

19:27.682 --> 19:29.348
Well, thanks for telling me.

19:29.350 --> 19:30.551
You're welcome.

19:36.657 --> 19:38.523
Wait, he...

19:38.525 --> 19:39.591
That doesn't look
very good, Nick.

19:39.593 --> 19:41.261
You should stop him because...

19:41.263 --> 19:42.230
- It looks like he's about to...
- Yeah. Excuse me...

19:44.197 --> 19:45.297
God!

19:46.766 --> 19:48.299
You absolute plonker.

19:48.301 --> 19:50.735
What do you think a rearview
mirror was invented for?

19:50.737 --> 19:52.239
Great! Thank you.

20:02.082 --> 20:04.916
Not even a scratch!
The truck is fine!

20:04.918 --> 20:08.988
Thank you so much! A very professional
moving company, thank you!

20:08.990 --> 20:12.127
Don't worry,
Cinder-ah, I'll tip 'em!

20:13.360 --> 20:14.662
Cheers, mate.

20:18.064 --> 20:20.531
Watch your step. Try not to
break everything this time.

20:20.533 --> 20:21.666
Yes, boss.

20:21.668 --> 20:23.202
I'm just saying.

20:23.204 --> 20:25.171
Thanks, mate.

20:25.173 --> 20:27.806
How has this happened? I feel like I'm
on <i>Candid Camera</i> or something, Nick.

20:27.808 --> 20:29.742
That's it, good work.

20:29.744 --> 20:31.409
What is that? A fridge?

20:31.411 --> 20:33.145
This here? That's a bookcase.

20:33.147 --> 20:35.580
- A bookcase? What?
- It's for his books.

20:35.582 --> 20:38.884
How much did you have to pay to get his dirty
old fridge shipped across the Atlantic?

20:38.886 --> 20:41.253
I don't know.
I had the office take care of it.

20:41.255 --> 20:44.289
How did this happen? I'm not running
some sort of storage facility, Nick!

20:44.291 --> 20:46.358
- This is so depressing!
- Honey, honey...

20:46.360 --> 20:50.896
It's his stuff. It's important
to him and it makes him happy.

20:50.898 --> 20:52.667
Well, that's all
that matters, I guess.

20:55.703 --> 20:56.769
What the...

20:56.771 --> 20:58.271
Bloody idiots!

20:58.273 --> 20:59.838
What did I just say
at the bottom of the stairs?

20:59.840 --> 21:02.074
And you were like,
"Yes, boss."

21:02.076 --> 21:03.742
You two morons are
gonna pay for this!

21:03.744 --> 21:06.511
So, does anyone know
where the fridge goes?

21:06.513 --> 21:07.980
Yeah, yeah.

21:07.982 --> 21:09.751
The fridge goes
in the bathroom.

21:11.285 --> 21:13.385
Stop! Stop!

21:13.387 --> 21:14.619
Amadeus!

21:14.621 --> 21:16.187
I don't mean
to be rude, Amadeus.

21:16.189 --> 21:19.759
I'm so sorry, but I'm afraid
it's just too much stuff!

21:19.761 --> 21:21.592
I know it's your things... No!

21:21.594 --> 21:24.963
But listen, either it's got to
go all in the barn over there

21:24.965 --> 21:26.397
or else it's got to
go in your bedroom.

21:26.399 --> 21:28.466
Do you understand me?
And I mean all of it.

21:28.468 --> 21:29.902
Amadeus, okay?

21:29.904 --> 21:31.740
Okay, guys,
let's get out of here!

21:42.550 --> 21:43.915
Sir, may I come in?

21:43.917 --> 21:45.850
Hey, big guy.

21:45.852 --> 21:47.853
Good one.

21:47.855 --> 21:50.892
We, uh... We found this
in the back of the truck.

21:55.530 --> 21:56.731
Now it's back!

21:59.734 --> 22:03.735
She is gonna be
so glad you found this.

22:03.737 --> 22:05.436
Here, let me give you...

22:05.438 --> 22:08.107
- Let me give you some...
- No, no, no. Sir, please.

22:08.109 --> 22:09.442
You've already
given us plenty.

22:09.444 --> 22:11.042
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah, of course.

22:11.044 --> 22:13.914
You take care
of yourself, okay?

22:15.116 --> 22:16.117
Yeah.

22:28.896 --> 22:31.032
You're a real doll.

22:40.742 --> 22:42.377
Amadeus, could you
pass the bread, please?

22:43.744 --> 22:45.444
Amadeus?

22:45.446 --> 22:46.447
The bread?

22:47.682 --> 22:48.880
What about it?

22:48.882 --> 22:51.282
Could you pass it, please?

22:51.284 --> 22:53.388
- Thank you, but I was asking your dad.
- Here you go.

22:56.123 --> 22:57.522
Amadeus,
please stop doing that.

22:57.524 --> 22:58.991
It's really annoying
when we're trying to eat.

22:58.993 --> 23:00.393
- Honey, honey...
- Mom!

23:00.395 --> 23:02.226
Can we just try and have
an enjoyable evening?

23:02.228 --> 23:04.262
- Well, are you going to ask him to stop, then?
- Dad?

23:04.264 --> 23:07.666
No one's allowed to do anything here.
I should've stayed home.

23:07.668 --> 23:08.901
This is your home.

23:08.903 --> 23:10.839
It was more fun there...

23:12.005 --> 23:14.842
Dad, this is your... Dad.

23:16.511 --> 23:17.809
Don't throw your food, please.

23:17.811 --> 23:19.177
All right, fine, carry on.

23:19.179 --> 23:21.047
Please, carry on
clicking your tongue

23:21.049 --> 23:24.116
and throwing food around the place.
Fine. I've had enough anyway.

23:24.118 --> 23:26.885
No, I don't feel
like it anymore.

23:26.887 --> 23:27.953
What a shame.

23:27.955 --> 23:29.588
Yeah, it's your own fault.

23:29.590 --> 23:30.856
Bored, huh?

23:30.858 --> 23:32.124
Tell me again
how you met Grandma.

23:32.126 --> 23:34.993
Yes, please, do tell us again.

23:34.995 --> 23:36.895
Why don't you
tell us the story

23:36.897 --> 23:39.000
on how you met your boss?

23:39.933 --> 23:41.369
How did you two meet?

23:43.169 --> 23:45.338
I guess I told him.

23:45.340 --> 23:47.740
I was angry.
I don't remember.

23:47.742 --> 23:49.540
That's convenient.

23:49.542 --> 23:51.076
Must run in the family,
not being able to remember things.

23:51.078 --> 23:52.944
- What?
- Nothing.

23:52.946 --> 23:54.614
I know you don't
wanna hear this

23:54.616 --> 23:56.214
but I think there's
something up with him.

23:56.216 --> 23:58.584
He just needs time to
get over the shock.

23:58.586 --> 24:01.252
Don't you think it'd be a good
idea just to take him to a doctor

24:01.254 --> 24:02.989
and get him checked out?
Make sure he doesn't have

24:02.991 --> 24:05.657
some kind of early onset
dementia or something?

24:05.659 --> 24:07.358
No, he's fine.

24:07.360 --> 24:09.261
He's fine,
you're fine, I'm fine,

24:09.263 --> 24:11.730
our marriage is fine,
everybody's fine, we're all fine!

24:11.732 --> 24:13.764
- Everything's fine!
- Are we gonna do this all night?

24:13.766 --> 24:15.401
I gotta get some shut-eye.

24:15.403 --> 24:16.838
Okay.

24:21.809 --> 24:23.375
I don't get it.

24:23.377 --> 24:26.511
That math teacher is no good
at explaining anything.

24:26.513 --> 24:28.012
Maybe he's a retard.

24:28.014 --> 24:30.214
You can't say
"retard" here, Grandpa.

24:30.216 --> 24:32.917
Well, then,
maybe he's an asshat.

24:32.919 --> 24:34.453
What's an "asshat"?

24:34.455 --> 24:36.254
You know, someone

24:36.256 --> 24:40.494
who has a hat on their ass.

24:42.664 --> 24:44.229
How do you take your coffee?

24:44.231 --> 24:46.065
Grandpa, I'm only 10.

24:46.067 --> 24:48.002
Coffee's good for your brain.

24:49.770 --> 24:51.272
Well, okay, then.
Coffee's good.

24:52.106 --> 24:53.838
Damn machines.

24:53.840 --> 24:56.608
Why do they have to make
everything so complicated?

24:56.610 --> 24:57.943
You have to put water in it.

24:57.945 --> 24:59.412
Oh.

24:59.414 --> 25:00.415
Okay.

25:05.019 --> 25:07.720
- Darn thing!
- Do you want me to help?

25:07.722 --> 25:09.555
Wait...

25:09.557 --> 25:12.894
Yeah, it's gotta brew
for a minute.

25:14.094 --> 25:15.661
Can you help me with my math?

25:15.663 --> 25:17.530
Can't your friends help you?

25:17.532 --> 25:20.598
You had to do calculations when
you were a veterinarian, right?

25:20.600 --> 25:22.337
Sure. Yeah, sure.

25:31.878 --> 25:33.945
We didn't do this in school.

25:33.947 --> 25:36.315
We always just let
our fractions

25:36.317 --> 25:39.621
stay whatever size they like.

25:40.655 --> 25:42.988
Then, should I do that?

25:42.990 --> 25:44.890
Sure. Sure, why not?

25:44.892 --> 25:48.126
They look pretty good
the way they are.

25:48.128 --> 25:49.397
Okay, thanks.

25:58.304 --> 26:00.105
Anyone seen the honey?

26:00.107 --> 26:01.873
Amadeus,
have you had any honey?

26:01.875 --> 26:03.709
I'm allergic to honey.

26:03.711 --> 26:05.577
Oh!

26:05.579 --> 26:07.311
You're a pretty lady.

26:07.313 --> 26:09.848
- Hello?
- How about the two of us

26:09.850 --> 26:11.716
going for coffee
somewhere, huh?

26:11.718 --> 26:13.752
Just the two of us.

26:13.754 --> 26:16.253
Oh, no, I'm so sorry.
Oh, how awful.

26:16.255 --> 26:18.824
Go! Get off! Get lost!

26:18.826 --> 26:20.561
- Absolutely fine.
- Get lost!

26:20.961 --> 26:22.159
Get!

26:22.161 --> 26:23.928
Fine, no problem.

26:23.930 --> 26:26.330
I hope you feel better.
Okay, bye.

26:26.332 --> 26:27.933
- Damn it!
- What's wrong?

26:27.935 --> 26:30.434
The gardener, he's still ill.
He's been off for weeks.

26:30.436 --> 26:33.073
- Well, Grandpa could help.
- I could help.

26:33.808 --> 26:35.973
I need something to do.

26:35.975 --> 26:38.944
Well, do you think you could manage it?
You really feel confident you could do it?

26:38.946 --> 26:40.945
Mom, he's not a baby.

26:40.947 --> 26:42.647
All right, well,

26:42.649 --> 26:45.451
just deadhead the roses, and
then, tidy up the borders a bit.

26:45.453 --> 26:47.485
Do you know what?
The hedge could do with a bit of a trim,

26:47.487 --> 26:49.922
just a couple of inches
or something.

26:49.924 --> 26:52.290
You don't have
to tell me, Sandra.

26:52.292 --> 26:53.992
It's Sarah, Amadeus.

26:53.994 --> 26:55.530
That's a good name, too.

26:56.696 --> 26:57.963
Who made that?

26:57.965 --> 26:59.167
I did.

27:01.135 --> 27:03.935
Whoo! You're a pretty lady.

27:03.937 --> 27:05.406
I'll see you later.

27:09.443 --> 27:13.177

I'm trimming the, uh...

28:20.447 --> 28:23.115
- What?
- The thingamajiggy.

28:23.117 --> 28:25.617
I said that much!

28:25.619 --> 28:27.118
It's that much.

28:27.120 --> 28:28.321
Spot on.

28:30.857 --> 28:34.158
If you ask me, I thought
it was much nicer before.

28:34.160 --> 28:35.694
No, no.

28:35.696 --> 28:39.130
- If you want me to leave this section, or...
- Stop!

28:39.132 --> 28:41.232
Do you want me to
cut it down, Sandra?

28:41.234 --> 28:43.902
- Oh, my God!
- It's your decision.

28:43.904 --> 28:45.904
Oh, God!

28:45.906 --> 28:48.339
<i>Well, you've always
wanted an English garden, right?</i>

28:48.341 --> 28:50.242
What's that got to do
with an English garden?

28:50.244 --> 28:52.944
Why has an English garden got a big
hole in the middle of the hedge?

28:52.946 --> 28:55.780
That's not an English garden.
That's just a wrecked garden.

28:55.782 --> 28:57.750
To tell you the truth,
I kinda like the look of it.

28:57.752 --> 28:59.984
I think that it makes the place
look bigger. It's kinda nice.

28:59.986 --> 29:03.021
Do you know how many fucking years
it takes to grow a hedge that high?

29:03.023 --> 29:04.956
Mom! You cannot
say the F-word!

29:04.958 --> 29:06.724
- Sorry, sweetheart, I can't help it.
- No cursing, honey.

29:06.726 --> 29:08.359
Nick, what are you
gonna do about this?

29:08.361 --> 29:09.861
What's he gonna
wreck next, you know?

29:09.863 --> 29:11.062
Buy a new hedge.

29:11.064 --> 29:12.532
- Hi, Dad.
- Buy a new hedge?

29:18.571 --> 29:20.771
Sorry, where'd you get those?

29:20.773 --> 29:21.809
From your garden.

29:23.244 --> 29:25.109
Do you like 'em?

29:26.546 --> 29:29.013
Are you deliberately trying
to drive me mad?

29:29.015 --> 29:30.148
- No.
- No?

29:30.150 --> 29:32.850
No, no, no.

29:32.852 --> 29:36.387
I'm trying to apologize
to you, Sandra.

29:36.389 --> 29:39.524
- Sarah.
- I didn't shear... Sarah.

29:39.526 --> 29:42.626
I didn't
cut myself properly...

29:42.628 --> 29:44.061
No, the...

29:44.063 --> 29:45.363
- Hedge.
- Hedge!

29:45.365 --> 29:46.731
Stop! Stop, Amadeus!

29:46.733 --> 29:49.033
Do you understand,
maybe, possibly

29:49.035 --> 29:51.002
why I might just
be a bit upset?

29:51.004 --> 29:53.338
You know what?
We're gonna have a party here, right?

29:53.340 --> 29:54.673
And all these people
are gonna come,

29:54.675 --> 29:56.907
and instead of
a beautiful hedge

29:56.909 --> 29:58.242
they're gonna see nothing!

29:58.244 --> 29:59.912
Just a big gap now!

29:59.914 --> 30:01.780
- Mom!
- And then, when they come into the garden...

30:01.782 --> 30:04.415
- Mom!
- ...there aren't gonna be any flowers anymore

30:04.417 --> 30:05.783
because you cut them all!

30:05.785 --> 30:07.485
- May I please...
- Do you what?

30:07.487 --> 30:10.454
Dad, we really
are so appreciative that

30:10.456 --> 30:11.956
you want to help out
around the house.

30:11.958 --> 30:14.926
However, I think
what Sarah's trying to say,

30:14.928 --> 30:17.195
and I think we're all in
agreement on this, is that

30:17.197 --> 30:21.299
if you have some
questions about gardening,

30:21.301 --> 30:24.903
it might be a good idea to check
with Sarah first before you...

30:24.905 --> 30:26.671
- It was Mom's idea!
- Right? I think...

30:26.673 --> 30:29.206
Okay, how about this?
I've got a better idea, Dad.

30:29.208 --> 30:31.242
How about, just

30:31.244 --> 30:34.178
no gardening. None.

30:34.180 --> 30:37.014
Elizabeth always loved roses.

30:37.016 --> 30:38.518
Mom's name was Margaret.

30:41.921 --> 30:43.790
- <i>Hello, darling.</i>
- <i>Hi, Mum.</i>

30:44.425 --> 30:46.691
You sound odd.

30:46.693 --> 30:49.528
I'm just finding it
quite difficult with Amadeus.

30:49.530 --> 30:52.396
<i>Lovely Amadeus?
What do you mean?</i>

30:52.398 --> 30:54.398
He's just being
really weird

30:54.400 --> 30:55.867
<i>and forgetful,</i>

30:55.869 --> 30:58.002
and I'm sure that
he's got some...

30:58.004 --> 31:00.571
You just have to be patient.

31:00.573 --> 31:03.341
<i>You have to learn to
look at it with...</i>

31:03.343 --> 31:05.978
Humor.
Humor and wisdom.

31:05.980 --> 31:07.244
<i>And that is the key.</i>

31:07.246 --> 31:08.914
<i>Darling, it can teach you</i>

31:08.916 --> 31:11.517
a lot about yourself,
and it's called love.

31:11.519 --> 31:13.350
<i>Speaking of love, how's Nick?</i>

31:13.352 --> 31:14.886
<i>Keeps his eyes shut as normal.</i>

31:14.888 --> 31:17.355
Doesn't wanna see what's
in front of him,

31:17.357 --> 31:20.157
- you know?
- Well, you know you have that problem sometimes.

31:20.159 --> 31:21.526
<i>I mean, don't we all?</i>

31:21.528 --> 31:22.927
Okay, Mum.
Well, listen, I'm really busy.

31:22.929 --> 31:25.231
I've got to go, okay?
I'll call you later.

31:25.233 --> 31:27.366
Darling, don't forget,
wisdom and humor.

31:27.368 --> 31:31.069
- Okay, bye. Love you. Bye.
- Bye.

31:31.071 --> 31:33.738
<i>Every morning,
Grandpa would take me to school and back.</i>

31:33.740 --> 31:37.142
<i>Sometimes, he was himself,
and sometimes not.</i>

31:37.144 --> 31:41.178
<i>Like, he started taking things and
leaving them in the wrong places.</i>

31:43.282 --> 31:46.085
<i>Once, he took a cooked chicken out of
the fridge and put it in his closet</i>

31:46.087 --> 31:48.654
<i>and Mom didn't find
it for a week.</i>

31:50.791 --> 31:54.292
<i>He would get up in the middle of
the night and walk around the house.</i>

31:54.294 --> 31:56.194
Maggie?
Are you there?

31:56.196 --> 31:57.896
Ah!

31:57.898 --> 32:00.464
You... Oh, no, it rains

32:00.466 --> 32:02.466
all the time here.

32:02.468 --> 32:04.935
- It's... In fact, I think it's...
- Dad. Dad.

32:07.307 --> 32:11.076
<i>Dad says old people get
confused and he'll settle down.</i>

32:11.078 --> 32:13.778
<i>Mom doesn't talk
about it anymore.</i>

32:13.780 --> 32:15.414
<i>She just spends more
and more time at work.</i>

32:15.416 --> 32:16.617
I'm hungry.

32:27.526 --> 32:28.960
Tell me a story, Grandpa.

32:28.962 --> 32:30.028
A story?

32:30.030 --> 32:32.030
About you and Dad
when he was my age.

32:32.032 --> 32:36.734
I once took your dad camping
with some friends

32:36.736 --> 32:39.270
in the 40-acre field
behind the house.

32:39.272 --> 32:44.041
Grandpa told us it was crawling with
bears at night, just to scare us.

32:44.043 --> 32:46.376
I did. I did.

32:48.815 --> 32:52.716
He said we had to arm ourselves
with all the tools in the shed

32:52.718 --> 32:55.854
just to defend ourselves
against the bears, right?

32:55.856 --> 32:57.822
Just to be able
to make it back and forth

32:57.824 --> 33:00.325
from the barn
without getting eaten.

33:00.327 --> 33:02.860
We had everything in that tent.
We had pitchforks,

33:02.862 --> 33:04.596
axes, we had handsaws,
you name it.

33:04.598 --> 33:06.898
You took your fishing rod.

33:06.900 --> 33:08.066
You remember that?

33:08.068 --> 33:09.300
How could I forget?

33:09.302 --> 33:13.003
As if you could
chase off a bear

33:13.005 --> 33:15.008
with a fishing rod.

33:16.510 --> 33:19.377
And then Grandpa goes out
to take a leak, right,

33:19.379 --> 33:23.583
and we hear this
strange, loud roar like...

33:25.519 --> 33:28.419
Grandpa comes runnin' back in,
and he says, "It was a bear."

33:28.421 --> 33:29.788
And I say, "Bears don't howl."

33:29.790 --> 33:32.022
And he said, "Around
here, they do, son."

33:32.024 --> 33:35.428
You know, I still don't think
there's any such thing as

33:36.228 --> 33:37.995
a howling bear.

33:37.997 --> 33:39.330
That was me.

33:41.001 --> 33:44.905
- You never told me that before.
- You never asked me.

33:49.408 --> 33:50.610
Come here.

33:55.482 --> 33:57.715
Dad, listen, I, uh...

33:57.717 --> 33:59.549
I spoke to a doctor.

33:59.551 --> 34:01.988
He thought it might be a good
idea if you came in to see him.

34:02.856 --> 34:03.991
Why?

34:06.459 --> 34:07.660
Well...

34:08.494 --> 34:09.830
Because

34:10.663 --> 34:13.398
I'm an idiot? That is all?

34:13.400 --> 34:14.766
- No.
- I'm an idiot.

34:14.768 --> 34:16.067
- Absolutely not.
- Is that what...

34:16.069 --> 34:17.101
Of course not.

34:17.103 --> 34:19.670
- You think I'm...
- No, Dad. Come on.

34:19.672 --> 34:22.340
You think I'm losing it.

34:22.342 --> 34:24.308
Well, well...

34:24.310 --> 34:27.980
I'm not gonna go
see a damn doctor.

34:27.982 --> 34:29.848
- Wait.
- He might be able to help. Keep an open mind.

34:29.850 --> 34:31.583
- No!
- All right, well, he might be able to help.

34:31.585 --> 34:33.418
- No!
- Okay.

34:33.420 --> 34:35.589
Now you sound
like your mother.

34:37.891 --> 34:39.556
Did she want you to
go to the doctor, too?

34:39.558 --> 34:41.525
I can't remember anymore.

34:41.527 --> 34:44.098
I don't remember anything.

34:45.831 --> 34:49.333
But he, I know,
he definitely...

34:49.335 --> 34:50.967
He can't help me.

34:50.969 --> 34:53.771
I know that definitely,
for sure.

34:53.773 --> 34:55.942
- Okay.
- Well...

35:04.518 --> 35:06.050
<i>Did you talk to him?</i>

35:06.052 --> 35:07.219
He's not going.

35:08.455 --> 35:09.954
Great. So what are
you gonna do now?

35:09.956 --> 35:11.623
Nothing.

35:11.625 --> 35:13.958
What do you want me to do?
Force him? How do you do that?

35:13.960 --> 35:15.927
How do you force an old man
to go to the doctor

35:15.929 --> 35:17.529
- when he doesn't want to go to the doctor?
- I don't know.

35:17.531 --> 35:18.996
How did you force me to
take in all of his old junk?

35:18.998 --> 35:20.797
You just do it
without telling him.

35:20.799 --> 35:23.134
He's got Alzheimer's
or something, Nick.

35:23.136 --> 35:26.237
I'm exhausted.
I can't carry on like this anymore.

35:26.239 --> 35:30.208
Neither of us have slept for weeks.
It's just too much.

35:30.210 --> 35:33.478
We can't manage on our own anymore, Nick.
We need help.

35:33.480 --> 35:35.547
Tomorrow,
I have to go to Berlin.

35:35.549 --> 35:38.183
Wait, what, Berlin?
But that's not in the calendar.

35:38.185 --> 35:40.518
James, he called me at the
end of the day yesterday.

35:40.520 --> 35:42.853
We've got to close
this, the Pfeiffer deal.

35:42.855 --> 35:44.523
Okay, but there's a problem,
because I've got my pitch,

35:44.525 --> 35:46.556
and you were meant to be
taking Tilda to the doctor.

35:46.558 --> 35:49.559
And Therese isn't here,
so how are we gonna make that work?

35:49.561 --> 35:50.764
That's taken care of.

35:52.498 --> 35:54.099
- Really?
- Dad's got it.

35:54.101 --> 35:56.934
- Are you joking?
- It was Tilda's idea.

35:56.936 --> 35:59.804
She even made him
a neck pouch.

35:59.806 --> 36:02.206
What do you mean, "a pouch"?
What, like, Paddington Bear pouch?

36:02.208 --> 36:05.076
Like, with his name and address on it.
Well, that's really helpful.

36:05.078 --> 36:07.011
I don't know who that is.

36:07.013 --> 36:08.880
Paddington Bear?
You don't know who Paddington Bear is?

36:08.882 --> 36:10.849
No. Must be an English thing.

36:10.851 --> 36:12.616
If you're gonna be sarcastic,
it's not gonna help.

36:12.618 --> 36:14.319
He takes her
to school every day.

36:14.321 --> 36:16.853
Matilda knows where
the doctor's office is.

36:16.855 --> 36:18.258
He's trying to be useful.

36:20.092 --> 36:21.529
Let him.

36:30.837 --> 36:32.170
<i>Hey, Dad. Where are you?</i>

36:32.172 --> 36:34.271
- I'm in Berlin, remember?
- Cool.

36:34.273 --> 36:36.040
Did Grandpa pick you up?

36:36.042 --> 36:37.842
<i>Of course, we're there now.</i>

36:37.844 --> 36:39.244
Okay. Can I talk to him?

36:39.246 --> 36:42.146
Grandpa's busy
filling out forms right now.

36:42.148 --> 36:44.181
- He's filling out forms?
- Yeah.

36:44.183 --> 36:45.550
Let me talk to him.

36:45.552 --> 36:47.918
- Yeah. And they're calling us in!
- Tilda, let me...

36:47.920 --> 36:49.790
- Bye!
- Tilda?

36:51.657 --> 36:52.958
- Hi.
- Hi.

36:52.960 --> 36:55.092
I have an appointment.
Matilda Ross.

36:55.094 --> 36:57.695
- You're very late, Matilda.
- Sorry.

36:57.697 --> 36:59.963
Um... Are you here alone?

36:59.965 --> 37:02.500
I'm afraid we can't see
unaccompanied minors.

37:02.502 --> 37:03.703
Oh, um...

37:05.005 --> 37:08.005
- My grandpa's in the men's room.
- Oh.

37:08.007 --> 37:10.775
I think he's going to
be a while in there.

37:10.777 --> 37:12.610
He ate something bad.

37:12.612 --> 37:13.777
Ooh.

37:13.779 --> 37:15.413
- Poor chap.
- Yeah.

37:15.415 --> 37:17.415
Okay, then, I'll tell
Dr. Edwards that you're here.

37:17.417 --> 37:18.619
Thank you.

37:20.420 --> 37:21.621
One more.

37:23.089 --> 37:24.989
That sounds fine.
No obstructions.

37:24.991 --> 37:28.192
- Can you help me with my zipper?
- Of course.

37:28.194 --> 37:31.228
- You've been using the new inhaler?
- Yeah.

37:31.230 --> 37:32.429
Can I ask you something?

37:32.431 --> 37:33.697
Of course.

37:33.699 --> 37:35.735
What's Alzheimer's?

37:37.469 --> 37:38.735
Why do you ask?

37:38.737 --> 37:40.371
I think my grandpa has it.

37:40.373 --> 37:41.838
Well, my mom thinks he has it.

37:41.840 --> 37:42.974
Is your mother a doctor?

37:42.976 --> 37:44.476
- No.
- Right.

37:44.478 --> 37:47.612
But my dad says my mom knows
goddamn everything.

37:47.614 --> 37:49.614
Tell me about your grandpa.

37:49.616 --> 37:50.915
He gets confused.

37:50.917 --> 37:52.349
Does he forget things?

37:52.351 --> 37:53.717
Most definitely, yes.

37:53.719 --> 37:54.820
That's normal.

37:54.822 --> 37:56.454
Happens when you get older.

37:56.456 --> 38:00.458
Hmm. I bet you never put
a chicken in the wardrobe.

38:00.460 --> 38:01.625
Alive or dead?

38:01.627 --> 38:02.761
Dead.

38:02.763 --> 38:03.998
Fair point.

38:09.136 --> 38:10.902
Sweetheart,

38:10.904 --> 38:13.605
I baked your favorite cake.

38:13.607 --> 38:15.806
I used your recipe.

38:23.282 --> 38:26.317
I guess I forgot
it in the kitchen.

38:26.319 --> 38:29.223
I'll be back
in a second. Yeah.

38:30.324 --> 38:31.956
Don't go anywhere.

38:31.958 --> 38:35.025
Now, imagine all these books

38:35.027 --> 38:38.529
are your grandpa's brain.
And because of the illness,

38:38.531 --> 38:42.136
now and again,
some of the books start falling over.

38:44.404 --> 38:46.471
The moment one falls,

38:46.473 --> 38:48.806
he forgets what's inside it.

38:48.808 --> 38:54.148
Depending on how he's doing,
some of the books might right themselves,

38:56.949 --> 38:59.185
but others
fall over instead.

39:00.619 --> 39:02.690
As the illness progresses,

39:03.456 --> 39:05.355
more fall over.

39:05.357 --> 39:06.759
And in the end,

39:07.661 --> 39:10.895
more books
fall off the shelf,

39:10.897 --> 39:12.165
completely,

39:13.900 --> 39:15.769
until, one day...

39:17.402 --> 39:19.872
He doesn't know anything?

39:30.449 --> 39:33.250
What can I do
to make him better?

39:33.252 --> 39:36.855
Well, you can give
him things to do

39:36.857 --> 39:40.592
so he feels needed and useful.

39:40.594 --> 39:42.393
That's important.

39:42.395 --> 39:46.496
When he says or does things
that seem odd,

39:46.498 --> 39:50.867
you should act like
he makes perfect sense to you.

39:50.869 --> 39:52.670
Step inside his world.

39:52.672 --> 39:54.308
That will help him.

40:03.315 --> 40:06.052
Strange.
Who put those in there?

40:06.786 --> 40:08.021
Oh!

40:10.623 --> 40:11.825
Amadeus?

40:12.525 --> 40:13.527
Amadeus?

40:14.393 --> 40:15.927
Amadeus!

40:15.929 --> 40:17.929
- Wait. Wait.
- Oh!

40:17.931 --> 40:19.764
It's all right.
Just stay there, okay?

40:19.766 --> 40:21.268
I'm on fire!

40:33.246 --> 40:35.246
Amadeus?

40:35.248 --> 40:38.116
Are you all right?
Are you hurt?

40:38.118 --> 40:40.117
I was trying to make a cake.

40:40.119 --> 40:43.554
Don't cry, it's...
Don't cry, it's okay.

40:43.556 --> 40:46.590
Don't cry, it's okay.

40:46.592 --> 40:49.027
It's okay, it's okay.

40:49.029 --> 40:51.895
Somebody put their high
shoes in the oven.

40:51.897 --> 40:54.300
Somebody put their high
shoes in the oven?

40:56.837 --> 40:58.835
You're mad at me,
aren't you?

40:58.837 --> 41:00.304
No, I'm not mad
at you, all right?

41:00.306 --> 41:03.273
Do you want to have
a bite of cake?

41:03.275 --> 41:05.242
- What?
- You want a bite of cake?

41:05.244 --> 41:09.915
I'd love to,
but you know what, I'm on a diet.

41:09.917 --> 41:13.050
No, don't. I'll tell
you what, shall we...

41:13.052 --> 41:14.951
We'll just have
a tiny bite, shall we?

41:14.953 --> 41:16.987
A little taste. Okay?

41:16.989 --> 41:18.525
Let's get it out
of the oven and...

41:19.792 --> 41:20.994
Wow!

41:24.630 --> 41:25.833
Look at that.

41:36.141 --> 41:37.340
That's not bad.

41:37.342 --> 41:39.277
That was Maggie's
favorite recipe.

41:39.279 --> 41:41.581
- Really? It's pretty yummy.
- Good.

41:43.083 --> 41:45.185
Do you want a bit?

41:49.656 --> 41:52.326
That's good. Yep.

41:58.998 --> 42:00.366
What are you doing up there?

42:02.902 --> 42:04.404
Looking for the honey.

42:06.038 --> 42:07.871
- Did you bake this?
- No, your dad did.

42:07.873 --> 42:10.007
Have a bit if you want.
It's not nearly as bad as it looks.

42:10.009 --> 42:11.141
I ate on the plane.

42:11.143 --> 42:12.879
- How was Berlin?
- It was good.

42:13.947 --> 42:16.179
- Is everything okay?
- No, not really.

42:16.181 --> 42:18.382
Your father forgot to take
Tilda to the doctor's.

42:18.384 --> 42:20.784
No, he didn't. I spoke to her.
He picked her up.

42:20.786 --> 42:24.255
No, she just told you he did.
I spoke to the surgery.

42:24.257 --> 42:27.659
And by the time I got home,
the kitchen was on fire,

42:27.661 --> 42:30.297
and so was your dad.
I had to put him out.

42:34.034 --> 42:37.134
If I'd got here any later, the house would've
burnt down, and your dad would be dead.

42:37.136 --> 42:40.204
You'd be having to identify him
with his dental records, probably.

42:40.206 --> 42:42.473
Thank God Tilda was
still at the doctor.

42:42.475 --> 42:45.476
This is crazy, Nick!
This can't happen again!

42:45.478 --> 42:47.779
And I'm sorry,
but it's your fault!

42:47.781 --> 42:49.447
- My fault?
- Yes!

42:49.449 --> 42:52.250
- How is it my fault?
- You're refusing to accept reality!

42:52.252 --> 42:54.351
No, the reality that
you're refusing to accept

42:54.353 --> 42:55.920
is that
you weren't here, either.

42:55.922 --> 42:58.456
- What?
- You could've rescheduled that pitch.

42:58.458 --> 43:00.224
- No!
- Are you kidding me?

43:00.226 --> 43:01.558
It was your responsibility
to take her to the doctor.

43:01.560 --> 43:03.027
That was the deal.

43:03.029 --> 43:05.362
I'm new to my job!
I can't call up Serge the night before...

43:05.364 --> 43:08.199
Serge? Oh, now
it's about Serge!

43:08.201 --> 43:10.101
What'd you pitch this time?
Your boobs?

43:10.103 --> 43:11.770
I'm sorry, what?

43:11.772 --> 43:14.739
No, I'm curious.
What did you pitch to Serge this time?

43:14.741 --> 43:16.342
Your boobs or your ass?

43:19.313 --> 43:21.045
Nice.

43:21.047 --> 43:23.713
You're no saint, either! I'm not the
only one who screwed up, remember?

43:23.715 --> 43:24.951
Dad.

43:31.424 --> 43:32.591
Oh, my...

43:45.237 --> 43:47.440
Dad, you wanna
shut the bathroom door?

43:49.576 --> 43:52.809
Are you going to get the
fridge from his room, or am I?

43:52.811 --> 43:54.712
<i>School finished
for the summer.</i>

43:54.714 --> 43:57.047
<i>I spent it all with Grandpa,
and I showed him London.</i>

43:57.049 --> 44:00.518
<i>Grandpa and I went sightseeing,

44:03.054 --> 44:06.023

<i>and not even knowing it.</i>

44:55.007 --> 44:57.840
<i>Dr. Edwards told me
that people with Alzheimer's</i>

44:57.842 --> 45:01.579
<i>are often best at remembering things
that happened a long time ago.</i>

45:01.581 --> 45:05.983
<i>So, me and Grandpa used to look at
this old photo album all the time.</i>

45:05.985 --> 45:09.552
<i>Even though I can recite all his
stories word-for-word in my sleep,</i>

45:09.554 --> 45:14.058
<i>it was just so wonderful to hear them,
because he always looked so happy.</i>

45:14.060 --> 45:17.527
Ah. That is the Lido.
That's the beach.

45:17.529 --> 45:21.799
Grandma and I had arguments
with the "lifestyle."

45:21.801 --> 45:25.603
- Margaret liked to go skinny-dipping.
- She did?

45:25.605 --> 45:28.239
Yeah, that would upset
the lifeguard a lot.

45:28.241 --> 45:32.777
She would just take off her
swimming suit and go in nude.

45:32.779 --> 45:37.184
She always got her way 'cause she
could argue anyone under the table.

45:39.217 --> 45:40.918
Where's... Where's that?

45:40.920 --> 45:43.987
Well, Saint Thingamajiggy.

45:43.989 --> 45:46.357
Look at all these seagulls.

45:46.359 --> 45:48.393
Margaret thought
they were cute

45:48.395 --> 45:52.563
until one of them crapped
on her Caprese salad

45:52.565 --> 45:54.965
right while she was eating it.

45:56.302 --> 45:57.737
I miss Grandma.

45:59.973 --> 46:01.775
Me, too, princess.

46:02.542 --> 46:03.907
Me, too.

46:03.909 --> 46:05.944
You know, when I die,

46:05.946 --> 46:09.114
we'll be together up there.

46:09.116 --> 46:11.983
I don't... I don't
want you to die, Grandpa.

46:11.985 --> 46:15.085
Oh, don't be silly, princess.

46:15.087 --> 46:17.721
Everyone has their time.

46:17.723 --> 46:19.422
And when...

46:19.424 --> 46:22.659
When Maggie and I
get back together again,

46:22.661 --> 46:25.429
we're gonna have
one hell of a party!

46:25.431 --> 46:27.799
We'll really shake it up.

46:29.335 --> 46:31.501
<i>I didn't believe
in heaven then,</i>

46:31.503 --> 46:35.373
<i>but I thought it was so nice of him
to try and comfort me like that.</i>

46:35.375 --> 46:38.007
<i>Really, it should've been me
comforting him.</i>

46:38.009 --> 46:41.045
<i>After that, I started
filming Grandpa a lot,</i>

46:41.047 --> 46:43.846
<i>like my parents did with me
when I was a baby.</i>

46:43.848 --> 46:46.016
<i>The way I see it,</i>

46:46.018 --> 46:48.018
<i>is when it gets to the stage where
he can't remember anything at all,</i>

46:48.020 --> 46:50.621
<i>he'll really like
to watch these videos.</i>

46:50.623 --> 46:53.056
Happy birthday.
How does it feel?

46:53.058 --> 46:54.458
How does what feel?

46:54.460 --> 46:57.597
- To be 76.
- I'm 76?

46:58.630 --> 47:01.366
I thought I was 42.

47:01.368 --> 47:03.335
What's your favorite color?

47:04.069 --> 47:05.670
Red.

47:05.672 --> 47:07.541
What's your favorite animal?

47:08.540 --> 47:09.674
Dog.

47:09.676 --> 47:12.876
How does it feel
to forget everything?

47:12.878 --> 47:15.382
Oh, it's like

47:17.415 --> 47:18.784
a head full of honey.

47:19.985 --> 47:21.652
All gummed up.

47:21.654 --> 47:24.288
How long have you had
this honey in your head?

47:24.290 --> 47:27.293
Since I can't
think straight anymore.

47:28.226 --> 47:30.696
Uh, but I have a...

47:31.665 --> 47:32.831
I have a...

47:43.109 --> 47:44.444
Let's see, I...

47:54.119 --> 47:55.589
Ruff! Dog.

47:56.221 --> 47:57.721
What's that?

47:57.723 --> 48:02.226
It's got everything in here
I need to remember.

48:02.228 --> 48:03.663
It's from...

48:05.063 --> 48:06.866
It was written by...

48:11.203 --> 48:13.036
Grandma made it for me.

48:13.038 --> 48:14.241
May I?

48:31.757 --> 48:35.025
Did Grandma know that
she was gonna die?

48:35.027 --> 48:36.726
No.

48:36.728 --> 48:39.431
It must have been me
that wrote it.

48:43.770 --> 48:45.369
She...

48:45.371 --> 48:49.005
She's dead, isn't she?

48:49.007 --> 48:51.009
Yes, Grandpa.

48:51.011 --> 48:53.013
See, I knew that.

49:06.292 --> 49:07.527
Ooh.

49:08.828 --> 49:11.462
And what do you think
you might be doing later?

49:11.464 --> 49:14.130
Let me check
with my wife, okay?

49:16.067 --> 49:17.300
Mum.

49:17.302 --> 49:18.869
We're gonna have
so much fun tonight.

49:18.871 --> 49:21.139
But first, we have to
have a little toast.

49:21.141 --> 49:23.174
To Amadeus. Happy birthday.

49:23.176 --> 49:24.407
To me? What?

49:24.409 --> 49:26.143
A toast, Amadeus.
For your birthday?

49:26.145 --> 49:27.578
I'm not thirsty.

49:27.580 --> 49:28.782
No?

49:30.415 --> 49:31.482
- One more time?
- Yes.

49:31.484 --> 49:32.683
Happy birthday!

49:32.685 --> 49:35.085
I told you I'm not thirsty!

49:35.087 --> 49:37.286
Are you an Alzheimer, woman?

49:37.288 --> 49:39.021
The aioli.

49:39.023 --> 49:41.493
- Well, the champagne's good anyway.
- Yes.

49:42.427 --> 49:43.761
Dad, Dad...

49:43.763 --> 49:45.362
That's to dip
your bread in, Amadeus.

49:45.364 --> 49:46.996
- Oh, God.
- Uh...

49:46.998 --> 49:49.366
- Goodness.
- Dad, that's not soap.

49:49.368 --> 49:50.668
Don't put it
on your face.

49:50.670 --> 49:53.371
Dad, that's to eat.
That's for eating.

49:53.373 --> 49:54.574
Oh, dear.

49:57.543 --> 49:59.677
Sweetie, not you. No.

49:59.679 --> 50:00.978
- Don't, don't...
- Tilda, stop it. No.

50:00.980 --> 50:02.645
- Don't.
- You're encouraging him.

50:02.647 --> 50:04.315
Don't. Mum, tell her.

50:04.317 --> 50:07.817
- No, no, you're the mum.
- Don't play with your food.

50:07.819 --> 50:10.020
- Thank you very much for that.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

50:10.022 --> 50:13.925
Well, I read that olive oil
is really good for your skin.

50:24.136 --> 50:25.938
So, where were we?

50:26.973 --> 50:29.940
I think I'm going
to have sea bass.

50:29.942 --> 50:30.808
Sea bass.

50:30.810 --> 50:33.911
- With asparagus.
- Mmm-hmm.

50:33.913 --> 50:38.148
What's it called when it's
still very hard?

50:39.786 --> 50:40.787
Al dente.

50:42.388 --> 50:44.288
Yes.

50:44.290 --> 50:47.692
- And you, madam?
- I would like the tuna tartare, please.

50:47.694 --> 50:50.059
- And you, miss?
- Mac and cheese, please.

50:50.061 --> 50:53.529
That's an excellent choice.
That's our signature dish.

50:53.531 --> 50:55.098
What are you
in the mood for, Dad?

50:55.100 --> 50:56.766
I just wanna go home.

50:56.768 --> 50:58.469
Sure,
we're gonna go home.

50:58.471 --> 51:01.971
We're gonna have a little dinner
first, for your birthday.

51:01.973 --> 51:03.239
How 'bout some...

51:05.377 --> 51:07.311
- Calves' liver, yeah.
- No, no, no.

51:07.313 --> 51:10.780
Just scratch that order.
He doesn't eat calves' liver.

51:10.782 --> 51:12.416
- Okay.
- Dad. Dad.

51:12.418 --> 51:14.284
What are you in
the mood for, Dad?

51:14.286 --> 51:16.920
What do I eat?

51:16.922 --> 51:20.590
- What do I usually eat?
- How about a Caprese salad?

51:20.592 --> 51:21.891
Right, yeah?
Two Caprese salads.

51:21.893 --> 51:24.496
Two Caprese salads. Thank you.

51:25.230 --> 51:27.598
It's okay, Dad.

51:27.600 --> 51:29.868
I just
wanna go home.

51:54.393 --> 51:56.692
What's... What's wrong,
Grandpa?

51:56.694 --> 51:58.496
Well, it feels so...

51:58.498 --> 51:59.933
So...

52:00.565 --> 52:02.232
Bad?

52:02.234 --> 52:04.101
So awfully, awfully,

52:04.103 --> 52:07.603
when you don't know
anything anymore.

52:07.605 --> 52:10.507
Everything's empty.

52:10.509 --> 52:14.811
If you want to write,
you can't.

52:14.813 --> 52:18.815
There's just
something inside that's

52:18.817 --> 52:21.217
stopping it from happening.

52:21.219 --> 52:23.956
Can you still remember
what you wanted to write?

52:26.726 --> 52:28.425
You... You write.

52:28.427 --> 52:29.628
Okay.

52:31.163 --> 52:33.132
For Tilda.

52:34.699 --> 52:36.069
My dear...

52:42.708 --> 52:44.675
- Dear...
- Granddaughter?

52:44.677 --> 52:47.612
No! I get to decide
what we write.

52:47.614 --> 52:48.679
Okay.

52:48.681 --> 52:50.817
The day will come

52:52.652 --> 52:54.654
when I won't

52:56.054 --> 52:57.656
remember...

53:03.529 --> 53:05.130
That you

53:06.498 --> 53:08.234
are you.

53:11.703 --> 53:15.239
But whatever happens,

53:15.241 --> 53:20.780
you must remember
one thing above all else.

53:22.781 --> 53:24.149
That I love you,

53:25.918 --> 53:32.556
and you are the most
wonderful princess

53:32.558 --> 53:34.991
I could ever wish for.

53:46.304 --> 53:48.172
<i>♪ Can't touch this</i>

53:48.174 --> 53:51.808
<i>♪ Don't act like a gangster
Can't touch this</i>

53:51.810 --> 53:53.979
<i>♪ Don't act like a gangster</i>

53:55.681 --> 53:57.648
<i>♪ You come round
making trouble</i>

53:57.650 --> 54:00.050
<i>♪ But you are prancing
like a ballerina ♪</i>

54:00.052 --> 54:02.953
Shut up!
Just shut up!

54:02.955 --> 54:05.788
What's wrong with you,
you idiot?

54:05.790 --> 54:07.626
What's wrong with you?

54:11.730 --> 54:14.030
Mr. Ross, this way, please.

54:14.032 --> 54:15.766
I'll come in
and hold your hand.

54:15.768 --> 54:17.867
- Huh?
- Want me to hold your hand?

54:17.869 --> 54:20.070
It's an appointment
for you, remember?

54:20.072 --> 54:21.572
Would you like
to come, too, sweetie?

54:21.574 --> 54:24.007
- Why don't you come with us? Okay.
- Yeah.

54:24.009 --> 54:27.145
So, I'll go wait right here.

54:29.281 --> 54:31.349
I'm Dr. Holst.

54:31.351 --> 54:32.885
Thought we could have
a little chat.

54:34.987 --> 54:36.186
How are you doing today?

54:36.188 --> 54:38.791
- Didn't you just ask that?
- No.

54:39.659 --> 54:41.525
- So?
- So what?

54:41.527 --> 54:43.360
How are you doing?

54:43.362 --> 54:47.396
- You just asked that.
- Perhaps, but you didn't give me an answer.

54:47.398 --> 54:49.398
- To what?
- To my question.

54:49.400 --> 54:52.469
This is gonna be
one hell of a "little chat."

54:52.471 --> 54:54.605
So, who have you
brought with you today?

54:54.607 --> 54:55.940
My parents.

54:55.942 --> 54:57.208
Your parents.

54:59.944 --> 55:01.911
Might that be
your granddaughter?

55:01.913 --> 55:04.982
That's... That's what I said.

55:04.984 --> 55:07.384
Can you tell me
how old she is?

55:07.386 --> 55:11.422
She's got so much time
ahead of her.

55:11.424 --> 55:13.059
Do you know how old she is?

55:17.230 --> 55:18.762
Nope.

55:18.764 --> 55:23.936
I can't even tell you how
old I was when she arrived.

55:25.404 --> 55:26.904
You were...

55:26.906 --> 55:28.605
You were 66.

55:28.607 --> 55:31.744
- Mmm, 66.
- Sixty-six?

55:32.344 --> 55:33.713
Mr. Ross,

55:34.781 --> 55:36.846
can you tell me
what nine plus three is?

55:36.848 --> 55:38.748
Oh, come on.

55:38.750 --> 55:42.786
You don't know
what nine plus three is?

55:42.788 --> 55:46.359
And you call yourself
a doctor?

55:47.759 --> 55:50.460
No wonder
they lost the colonies.

55:50.462 --> 55:53.130
Well, I'm from Louisiana,
so I didn't lose a thing.

55:53.132 --> 55:55.199
Well, then, you were
on the right side.

55:55.201 --> 55:58.101
- Here we go.
- Now, I've got a question.

55:58.103 --> 55:59.869
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

55:59.871 --> 56:02.975
What's white
and lives in a bottle?

56:04.676 --> 56:05.909
I'm sorry?

56:05.911 --> 56:08.878
You haven't answered
my question.

56:08.880 --> 56:10.817
What's white
and lives in a bottle?

56:12.085 --> 56:13.282
Milk.

56:13.284 --> 56:15.221
What do you put
in a milkshake?

56:16.556 --> 56:17.721
Milk.

56:17.723 --> 56:19.025
And what do cows drink?

56:22.360 --> 56:23.726
- Milk.
- Aha!

56:23.728 --> 56:26.395
Wrong. Water.

56:26.397 --> 56:28.498
Cows drink water.

56:30.101 --> 56:32.201
Now, if you'll excuse me...

56:32.203 --> 56:33.737
Where are you going, Mr. Ross?

56:33.739 --> 56:35.170
Oh...

56:35.172 --> 56:37.974
- I have things to do.
- Dad...

56:37.976 --> 56:39.643
I'd like to finish
our little chat.

56:39.645 --> 56:43.746
Well, my assistant will
arrange another appointment.

56:43.748 --> 56:45.849
Right now,

56:45.851 --> 56:48.851
- I have to get to surgery.
- Dad?

56:48.853 --> 56:51.087
He was a veterinarian,
you know.

56:51.089 --> 56:52.824
Hold on,
we'll be right with you.

56:55.795 --> 56:59.295
<i>For our summer party, Mom and
Grandpa agreed he'd stay in his room.</i>

56:59.297 --> 57:03.967
<i>In exchange, he'd be allowed to watch
the big firework show at midnight.</i>

57:03.969 --> 57:06.304
- It's so nice you're all here.
- If I may?

57:07.440 --> 57:08.905
- Serge?
- Sarah!

57:08.907 --> 57:10.409
- What are you doing here?
- Well, that's a lovely welcome.

57:12.411 --> 57:13.610
And your wife's here.

57:13.612 --> 57:15.045
Well, she gets easily bored
at home alone.

57:19.284 --> 57:22.386
- Nick knows about us.
- What?

57:22.388 --> 57:24.420
- Nick knows about us.
- How?

57:24.422 --> 57:25.922
- 'Cause I told him.
- Are you kidding?

57:25.924 --> 57:27.824
No, I'm not kidding.

57:27.826 --> 57:30.196
I'd never have come if I'd known,
nor would I have brought my wife.

57:46.645 --> 57:48.177
- Amadeus?
- Mmm?

57:48.179 --> 57:49.679
What on earth
do you look like?

57:49.681 --> 57:51.916
It's Fourth of July.

57:51.918 --> 57:55.518
Somebody has to represent
the colonies.

57:55.520 --> 57:58.253
- Have you sucked them all?
- They're excellent.

57:58.255 --> 57:59.889
- You try one?
- No, thank you.

57:59.891 --> 58:01.958
- Help.
- Amadeus!

58:01.960 --> 58:03.893
- No, no, don't, Mum. No, no.
- Amadeus!

58:03.895 --> 58:06.164
Oh, how delightful to see you.

58:07.031 --> 58:08.532
You're dressed to kill.

58:08.534 --> 58:09.833
Do I know you?

58:09.835 --> 58:12.768
Ha-ha, you old soldier.

58:12.770 --> 58:14.170
I got to leave.

58:14.172 --> 58:16.473
No, no, wait, wait.
We're going to party.

58:16.475 --> 58:19.242
No, no, no, you're not going to party, Mum.
Let him go, please.

58:19.244 --> 58:22.012
Nice job, buddy.
I'm loving the music.

58:22.014 --> 58:23.813
Yeah, it's not bad.

58:23.815 --> 58:26.349
It was all LPs in my day.

58:26.351 --> 58:29.686
LPs, yeah. Gotta have a wee.
Can you watch out here?

58:29.688 --> 58:31.154
Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah.

58:31.156 --> 58:33.023
Hey. There's a problem.

58:33.025 --> 58:34.692
- What's up?
- Promise you won't get cross.

58:34.694 --> 58:36.393
Why would I get cross
with you? What's up?

58:36.395 --> 58:38.061
- Promise me.
- I promise.

58:38.063 --> 58:39.596
- Serge is here.
- I'm sorry?

58:39.598 --> 58:42.766
- Serge is here.
- You're kidding me.

58:42.768 --> 58:44.434
No, I'm not kidding you.

58:44.436 --> 58:46.636
- Well, tell him to leave.
- I can't do that. He's my boss.

58:46.638 --> 58:50.042
- You tell him to leave or I will.
- No, you won't.

58:51.976 --> 58:53.212
Ah!

58:53.911 --> 58:55.612
You must be Nick!

58:55.614 --> 58:58.114
Sarah, you certainly got lucky.
What a handsome fella.

58:58.116 --> 58:59.349
And talking of lucky...

58:59.351 --> 59:01.652
- Have you met Nora, my wife?
- Hi.

59:01.654 --> 59:03.253
Yes! So nice to meet you, hi!

59:03.255 --> 59:05.021
Lovely to meet you.

59:05.023 --> 59:07.259
Nice to see you. This is Nick.

59:08.025 --> 59:09.427
My hands are...

59:13.098 --> 59:15.498
So, how are you finding England, then?
A bit quieter than New York?

59:15.500 --> 59:18.101
Um, well, we were
in Connecticut, actually,

59:18.103 --> 59:19.603
which isn't quite
the Big Apple, but so...

59:19.605 --> 59:21.971
Yeah, Sarah likes to create
her own excitement.

59:21.973 --> 59:23.974
- Don't you, honey?
- Nick.

59:23.976 --> 59:26.375
Well, she's certainly shaking up our
office. I'm delighted to have her.

59:26.377 --> 59:28.311
- No shit.
- How's the dip?

59:28.313 --> 59:29.746
I love it. What is it?

59:29.748 --> 59:31.547
- It's, um...
- It's eggplant.

59:31.549 --> 59:33.849
- Yeah.
- Mmm. Over here, we call it "aubergine."

59:33.851 --> 59:36.954
Yeah, well, over there,
we call it "eggplant."

59:36.956 --> 59:39.521
We can adapt now we're here.
We can call it aubergine, can't we?

59:39.523 --> 59:41.090
What's wrong
with eggplant, honey?

59:41.092 --> 59:43.293
It's been eggplant
for the last 11 years.

59:43.295 --> 59:45.494
I like eggplant.
I love eggplant.

59:45.496 --> 59:46.963
I'm just saying,
what's the big deal?

59:46.965 --> 59:49.299
Maybe it is
a big deal to me.

59:49.301 --> 59:50.800
Well, if you care
about it so much,

59:50.802 --> 59:52.402
maybe you could talk to me
about it once in a while.

59:52.404 --> 59:54.337
Could you two
give us a minute?

59:54.339 --> 59:55.739
- No, Nick...
- No, it's fine.

59:55.741 --> 59:57.474
Serge, don't. No.

59:57.476 --> 59:59.342
- I wouldn't. Please. Serge, I...
- Come on, Nick.

59:59.344 --> 01:00:01.547
Look, I just wanted to say...

01:00:02.147 --> 01:00:03.646
Listen, I am...

01:00:03.648 --> 01:00:07.282
What happened with your wife
at that Christmas party,

01:00:07.284 --> 01:00:10.085
it was a one-off.
You know, party,

01:00:10.087 --> 01:00:12.422
booze, going crazy...

01:00:12.424 --> 01:00:14.657
I mean, let's not sugarcoat it.
We've all been there.

01:00:14.659 --> 01:00:17.126
We've all done it.
You've done it.

01:00:17.128 --> 01:00:18.462
- I've done it?
- Penny?

01:00:18.464 --> 01:00:20.762
- Penny?
- From your office?

01:00:20.764 --> 01:00:22.632
She told you about Penny?

01:00:22.634 --> 01:00:24.634
Well, I guess she had
to talk to someone.

01:00:24.636 --> 01:00:26.536
Come on, Nico,

01:00:26.538 --> 01:00:30.773
you've been dipping in the honeypot
yourself, you slick bastard.

01:00:30.775 --> 01:00:32.875
Slurping away at the...

01:00:32.877 --> 01:00:36.381
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

01:00:41.619 --> 01:00:43.152
Hey, Serge, are you okay?

01:00:43.154 --> 01:00:44.853
Why'd you hit my husband?

01:00:44.855 --> 01:00:46.058
Ask her.

01:01:00.672 --> 01:01:02.107
Oh, shit!

01:01:13.384 --> 01:01:15.321
The Russians are coming!

01:01:23.862 --> 01:01:26.432
Come on! Come on!

01:02:11.909 --> 01:02:13.411
Dad, is everything okay?

01:02:19.817 --> 01:02:21.286
Dad, what's up?

01:02:25.156 --> 01:02:26.458
I love you.

01:02:29.427 --> 01:02:32.230
That's the first time
you've ever told me that.

01:02:34.532 --> 01:02:38.203
Did I ever tell you
how much I love you?

01:02:43.909 --> 01:02:45.878
If you have,

01:02:47.712 --> 01:02:49.380
then I've forgotten.

01:02:51.282 --> 01:02:53.384
But don't take it personally.

01:02:59.123 --> 01:03:00.658
Where's Sandra?

01:03:01.594 --> 01:03:02.992
Sarah.

01:03:02.994 --> 01:03:05.161
She took off for a couple days.
She'll be back.

01:03:05.163 --> 01:03:07.266
Why would she do that?

01:03:08.868 --> 01:03:12.770
- Dad...
- Did you two get in a fight?

01:03:13.371 --> 01:03:15.473
You can tell me.

01:03:16.007 --> 01:03:17.743
I'm your father.

01:03:21.145 --> 01:03:23.715
Dad, don't you
remember anything?

01:03:24.616 --> 01:03:25.650
No.

01:03:27.052 --> 01:03:28.521
It's all gone.

01:03:30.355 --> 01:03:33.225
There's just a hole in there.

01:03:48.172 --> 01:03:49.907
It's never clear.

01:03:49.909 --> 01:03:53.041
It is never clear
how it will progress.

01:03:53.043 --> 01:03:57.681
Rapid deterioration may be followed
by a long period of stability.

01:03:57.683 --> 01:04:03.286
Your father likes to hide
his confusion behind humor,

01:04:03.288 --> 01:04:05.924
which I find intelligent,
very likable.

01:04:07.259 --> 01:04:10.460
But what you need
to ask yourself is this...

01:04:10.462 --> 01:04:12.831
Are you prepared
to take care of him?

01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:17.500
Dealing with someone
with dementia

01:04:17.502 --> 01:04:20.570
is a full-time job
and it's not easy.

01:04:20.572 --> 01:04:22.538
If you reach the point...

01:04:22.540 --> 01:04:25.174
Rather, when you reach
the point when you realize

01:04:25.176 --> 01:04:28.511
you can no longer give your
father the care that he needs,

01:04:28.513 --> 01:04:31.514
you will have to consider
the alternatives

01:04:31.516 --> 01:04:33.686
before the situation
becomes critical.

01:04:37.355 --> 01:04:40.190
I understand, Mr. Ross.
I really do.

01:04:40.192 --> 01:04:42.759
My father had dementia, too.

01:04:42.761 --> 01:04:47.529
I'm afraid there are no ideal
outcomes in this kind of situation.

01:04:47.531 --> 01:04:50.866
There are simply
least worst ones.

01:04:50.868 --> 01:04:53.103
The best thing you
can do right now is

01:04:53.105 --> 01:04:56.773
find a good home for him
and get his name on the list.

01:04:58.710 --> 01:04:59.742
Leighton Fisher.

01:04:59.744 --> 01:05:01.511
Hi, Pam. Can I
speak with my dad?

01:05:01.513 --> 01:05:03.445
Oh, I'm afraid he's not here,
sweetheart.

01:05:03.447 --> 01:05:04.514
Is he at lunch?

01:05:04.516 --> 01:05:07.016
No, no, he's gone for the day.

01:05:07.018 --> 01:05:09.853
- I think he went to look at a nursing home.
- A what?

01:05:09.855 --> 01:05:13.223
For your grandpa.
Yep, yeah, that was it.

01:05:13.225 --> 01:05:14.960
What? No.

01:05:16.293 --> 01:05:18.663
Dad wouldn't do that.

01:05:19.496 --> 01:05:21.197
Maybe I got it wrong.

01:05:21.199 --> 01:05:22.933
No way.

01:05:22.935 --> 01:05:24.335
Shit!

01:05:29.741 --> 01:05:31.608
I'll be honest,
Mr. Ross.

01:05:31.610 --> 01:05:33.576
Few residents
really want to move here.

01:05:33.578 --> 01:05:37.246
And some do slide backwards,
faced with an unfamiliar environment.

01:05:37.248 --> 01:05:40.449
But they adjust. We make sure
they have a routine, which helps,

01:05:40.451 --> 01:05:41.985
and lots of activities.

01:05:41.987 --> 01:05:44.554
And they often make new
friends, which is nice.

01:05:44.556 --> 01:05:46.188
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

01:05:51.362 --> 01:05:53.462
What the...

01:05:53.464 --> 01:05:55.732
- Hilda, no!
- Hello.

01:05:55.734 --> 01:05:59.034
I'm Hilda.
You can call me Bunny.

01:05:59.036 --> 01:06:02.271
- Okay.
- We met at the theater, didn't we?

01:06:02.273 --> 01:06:04.206
Or was it the opera?

01:06:04.208 --> 01:06:05.942
<i>La traviata!</i>

01:06:05.944 --> 01:06:08.311
No, I think you're mistaking
me for someone else.

01:06:08.313 --> 01:06:09.980
You're American!

01:06:09.982 --> 01:06:13.052
- Hasn't he got a lovely accent?
- He has, yes.

01:06:14.185 --> 01:06:16.786
Shall we have
a bit of a shag?

01:06:16.788 --> 01:06:19.454
- Just a little one?
- Okay, okay, Hilda. That's enough now.

01:06:19.456 --> 01:06:21.824
- That's enough now. That's enough now.
- Well, think about it.

01:06:21.826 --> 01:06:24.025
- Hilda...
- Or we could do it in the...

01:06:24.027 --> 01:06:26.128
You may be aware that

01:06:26.130 --> 01:06:30.900
inappropriate sexual behavior
can be an issue with Alzheimer's.

01:06:30.902 --> 01:06:33.869
Hilda's one of our
more challenging cases,

01:06:33.871 --> 01:06:35.938
but we keep
a close eye on things.

01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:37.940
And we would ensure
your father is shielded

01:06:37.942 --> 01:06:39.775
from female attention
as far as possible.

01:06:39.777 --> 01:06:43.445
Well, that's the last thing
he's gonna want, trust me.

01:06:43.447 --> 01:06:46.051
You might wanna
shield them from him.

01:07:01.299 --> 01:07:03.398
- How am I gonna tell him?
- Don't.

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:05.735
He won't understand.

01:07:05.737 --> 01:07:09.471
Think about what it's like when children
go to nursery for the first time.

01:07:09.473 --> 01:07:12.375
They cry and throw
themselves on the floor.

01:07:12.377 --> 01:07:16.545
And after just three days or so,
you can't get them to leave the place.

01:07:16.547 --> 01:07:18.447
You have no reason
to feel guilty

01:07:18.449 --> 01:07:21.516
if you decide to have your father
looked after by other people.

01:07:21.518 --> 01:07:23.786
In fact, it will
be good for him.

01:07:23.788 --> 01:07:25.221
Mr. Ross,

01:07:25.223 --> 01:07:29.157
it's a difficult decision,
but please don't be concerned.

01:07:29.159 --> 01:07:30.893
We keep our residents safe

01:07:30.895 --> 01:07:33.798
and we do everything we can
to make them happy.

01:07:43.407 --> 01:07:45.407
What are you
thinking about, Grandpa?

01:07:45.409 --> 01:07:47.444
Venice.

01:07:47.446 --> 01:07:51.581
Venice? Tell me again how the pigeon
pooped on Grandma's Caprese salad.

01:07:51.583 --> 01:07:54.683
Grandma and I wanted

01:07:54.685 --> 01:07:58.587
to take you to Venice
when you were older.

01:07:58.589 --> 01:08:01.757
We wanted to show you
where we...

01:08:01.759 --> 01:08:04.529
Where we fell in...

01:08:10.835 --> 01:08:14.237
Show you where we...
To see where...

01:08:14.239 --> 01:08:16.206
Did you know

01:08:16.207 --> 01:08:19.943
that Pittsburgh has
more bridges than Venice?

01:08:22.679 --> 01:08:24.613
I don't believe you.

01:08:24.615 --> 01:08:27.750
Shall we go see for ourselves?

01:08:27.752 --> 01:08:30.988
- To Pittsburgh?
- To Venice, silly.

01:08:33.657 --> 01:08:36.895
I can't even find
my way to the...

01:08:40.231 --> 01:08:41.633
What if we went

01:08:42.366 --> 01:08:43.569
together?

01:08:49.206 --> 01:08:51.042
I'm no good anymore,

01:08:51.575 --> 01:08:53.145
at anything.

01:08:54.178 --> 01:08:55.711
I'm worthless.

01:08:55.712 --> 01:08:57.515
No, you're not, Grandpa.

01:08:59.417 --> 01:09:00.886
I love you.

01:09:36.187 --> 01:09:37.189
Hi.

01:09:37.654 --> 01:09:38.953
Nick.

01:09:38.956 --> 01:09:40.223
- Can I talk to Sarah?
- It's about time.

01:09:40.225 --> 01:09:41.756
- Can I talk to her?
- She's asleep.

01:09:41.759 --> 01:09:43.693
- At this time?
- Yes.

01:09:43.694 --> 01:09:45.394
She's barely slept
the last few nights.

01:09:45.395 --> 01:09:46.662
Why haven't you called?

01:09:46.663 --> 01:09:47.863
Maybe 'cause I'm not
the one who left.

01:09:47.865 --> 01:09:50.100
Don't play
the macho card with me.

01:09:50.102 --> 01:09:52.466
You're the one
who ruined her party,

01:09:52.469 --> 01:09:55.438
and made sure that everyone found out
about what happened between her and Serge.

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:58.006
Good work. Simply astounding.

01:09:58.008 --> 01:09:59.942
- I'm sorry.
- Well, you tell her that.

01:09:59.944 --> 01:10:01.210
Well, that's why I'm here.

01:10:01.212 --> 01:10:02.412
How's Amadeus?

01:10:02.414 --> 01:10:03.682
He's worse.

01:10:06.151 --> 01:10:08.583
I think I'll put
the kettle on.

01:10:08.585 --> 01:10:12.089
We're all out of tea,
so I thought this might do the trick.

01:10:14.959 --> 01:10:16.060
Lovely.

01:10:24.503 --> 01:10:25.804
Hmm.

01:10:26.838 --> 01:10:28.837
- It's a martini.
- Hmm?

01:10:28.839 --> 01:10:30.939
It's a martini glass you're looking
at, and if that's all you're gonna do,

01:10:30.941 --> 01:10:32.942
- I'm gonna go back upstairs.
- I'm sorry.

01:10:32.944 --> 01:10:34.610
I'm sorry for being a dick.

01:10:34.612 --> 01:10:36.211
I'm sorry I punched the guy,

01:10:36.213 --> 01:10:39.317
although he had it coming,
and I'd do it again.

01:10:40.185 --> 01:10:41.285
Look...

01:10:42.387 --> 01:10:44.121
I just want you to come home.

01:10:45.822 --> 01:10:47.892
I just want to make
everything better.

01:11:00.972 --> 01:11:03.108
Why is Grandpa
sleeping in your bed?

01:11:04.342 --> 01:11:05.940
He had a bad dream.

01:11:05.942 --> 01:11:09.444
He thought that the Russians
were coming again.

01:11:09.446 --> 01:11:11.713
You're a really wonderful
girl, you know that?

01:11:11.715 --> 01:11:13.549
I'm very proud of you.

01:11:13.551 --> 01:11:15.618
See, I can take care of him.
You don't have to put him in a home.

01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:19.255
Grandpa can't stay in the house
on his own anymore. You know that.

01:11:19.257 --> 01:11:20.991
It's too dangerous
for him now.

01:11:20.993 --> 01:11:22.625
You want to put him
in a home, too.

01:11:22.627 --> 01:11:26.828
No, I want him to be somewhere
where he's safe and happy.

01:11:26.830 --> 01:11:31.134
Happy? Happy in a home?
Well, why don't you put me in a home?

01:11:31.136 --> 01:11:34.237
- I would be happy in a home.
- Tilda, that's not fair.

01:11:34.239 --> 01:11:37.707
The place Dad's found is so
nice, and it's really close by,

01:11:37.709 --> 01:11:39.475
and we can go every day
and visit him,

01:11:39.477 --> 01:11:42.211
and pick him up and take
him out on fun days out.

01:11:42.213 --> 01:11:45.715
Fun days out? I barely even
know what a fun day out is.

01:11:45.717 --> 01:11:48.417
- You and Dad are always working.
- Well, we'll work less.

01:11:48.419 --> 01:11:51.220
- That's what you said last year.
- It's all gonna be okay.

01:11:51.222 --> 01:11:52.087
I promise.

01:11:52.089 --> 01:11:54.690
Okay, well, good night.

01:11:54.692 --> 01:11:56.792
<i>"I promise you."</i>

01:11:56.794 --> 01:12:00.395
<i>Mom and Dad have promised me a
million times that they'll work less,</i>

01:12:00.397 --> 01:12:01.831
<i>but they never actually do it.</i>

01:12:01.833 --> 01:12:04.132
<i>It's just work, work, work
for them.</i>

01:12:04.134 --> 01:12:07.036
<i>Back in Connecticut,
Smilla's dad said that</i>

01:12:07.038 --> 01:12:09.005
<i>the worst thing
parents can do</i>

01:12:09.007 --> 01:12:12.107
<i>is to make promises to their
children and not keep them.</i>

01:12:12.109 --> 01:12:16.045
<i>I stayed awake all night and
thought about what Dr. Edwards said,</i>

01:12:16.047 --> 01:12:19.814
<i>and about Grandpa, and about the
fact that he needs a purpose.</i>

01:12:19.816 --> 01:12:23.019
<i>That's why I had to take
things in my own hands.</i>

01:12:23.021 --> 01:12:25.488
Grandpa.
Wake up, wake up.

01:12:25.490 --> 01:12:29.225
- They're back?
- No, they're still sleeping.

01:12:29.227 --> 01:12:33.762
As long as the enemy is
sleeping, we're safe, then.

01:12:33.764 --> 01:12:37.632
Exactly. Now let's go
conquer Italy.

01:12:37.634 --> 01:12:39.167
I have to go to surgery.

01:12:39.169 --> 01:12:42.671
No, you're not, Grandpa.
You're on a holiday.

01:12:42.673 --> 01:12:45.310
Outside in 10 minutes,
all right?

01:13:11.268 --> 01:13:13.235
What are you
looking for, Grandpa?

01:13:13.237 --> 01:13:17.073
Someone stole the steering,
the steering thing.

01:13:17.075 --> 01:13:19.608
It's on this side, Grandpa.

01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:21.577
This is England, remember?

01:13:21.579 --> 01:13:23.112
Ah.

01:13:23.114 --> 01:13:26.882
Why did the Siamese twins
move to England?

01:13:26.884 --> 01:13:29.952
- I don't know.
- So the other one could drive.

01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:35.491
Well, what are we waiting for?

01:13:35.493 --> 01:13:37.129
Grandpa, I can't drive.

01:13:39.097 --> 01:13:41.900
Boy, I can't remember
how the...

01:13:44.369 --> 01:13:45.234
The, you know...

01:13:45.236 --> 01:13:46.935
It's an automatic, Grandpa.

01:13:46.937 --> 01:13:48.973
You have to put your foot
on the brake.

01:13:53.544 --> 01:13:55.012
Yeah.

01:13:55.545 --> 01:13:56.548
Push that.

01:14:01.686 --> 01:14:03.519
Okay.

01:14:03.521 --> 01:14:05.223
Purrs like a kitten.

01:14:11.462 --> 01:14:12.864
Now, the gas.

01:14:18.503 --> 01:14:19.504
Oh, my God!

01:14:20.437 --> 01:14:21.737
Nick! Nick!

01:14:21.739 --> 01:14:23.639
I think that was reverse.

01:14:23.641 --> 01:14:25.207
No shit, Sherlock.

01:14:25.209 --> 01:14:28.144
- Sherlock who?
- Holmes, silly.

01:14:28.146 --> 01:14:29.848
I think we're being robbed!

01:14:33.985 --> 01:14:35.717
You... Get up!

01:14:35.719 --> 01:14:38.487
You've gotta get up!
You're gotta come downstairs. Come on!

01:14:38.489 --> 01:14:41.393
Stop! Stop! Stop!

01:14:43.928 --> 01:14:45.595

So do you wanna sit on my lap and

01:15:12.222 --> 01:15:15.326
No, Grandpa, I have to
keep my seat belt on.

01:15:26.736 --> 01:15:29.738
- Get out of the way!
- Grandpa, it's a one-way street!

01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:31.907
I know it's a one-way street!

01:15:31.909 --> 01:15:33.612

01:16:38.575 --> 01:16:39.643

01:16:53.958 --> 01:16:55.091
Battle of Verdun.

01:16:55.093 --> 01:16:57.329
- First World War.
- Yes.

01:17:03.167 --> 01:17:04.736
It's all gone through.

01:17:05.570 --> 01:17:07.002
Enjoy Venice.

01:17:07.004 --> 01:17:08.336
Thank you very much.

01:17:08.338 --> 01:17:10.605
So, hang on.
You're... It's a...

01:17:10.607 --> 01:17:14.309
- A tentative missing persons search?
- Uh-huh.

01:17:14.311 --> 01:17:15.711
- That's all you can do?
- Yep.

01:17:15.713 --> 01:17:18.046
- That's pretty weak.
- Well, that's what it is.

01:17:18.048 --> 01:17:19.582
The child's in the care
of an adult.

01:17:19.584 --> 01:17:22.717
A barely functioning adult,
as I've explained to you.

01:17:22.719 --> 01:17:24.653
He's more likely to be in her
care, for God's sake!

01:17:24.655 --> 01:17:26.454
You remember him,
he was in here a couple of months ago

01:17:26.456 --> 01:17:27.957
looking for his dead wife!

01:17:27.959 --> 01:17:29.890
- I don't.
- Well, have you got Alzheimer's, too?

01:17:29.892 --> 01:17:31.226
Not that I'm aware of.

01:17:31.228 --> 01:17:32.729
Perhaps you could
be more helpful, then?

01:17:32.731 --> 01:17:34.796
- I'm trying to help, okay?
- Carry on.

01:17:34.798 --> 01:17:36.564
- Thank you, thank you.
- Please, be my guest.

01:17:36.566 --> 01:17:38.399
- Your father...
- Not really.

01:17:38.401 --> 01:17:41.069
- Your father drove off with your daughter.
- Yes.

01:17:41.071 --> 01:17:42.570
Do you want us to send
a helicopter

01:17:42.572 --> 01:17:44.840
with an infrared camera
or something?

01:17:44.842 --> 01:17:46.641
That would be great.

01:17:46.643 --> 01:17:48.644
- That would be fantastic.
- I mean, your father is a grown man.

01:17:48.646 --> 01:17:49.877
No, not really.

01:17:49.879 --> 01:17:51.412
Thank you.

01:17:51.414 --> 01:17:52.848
Thank you!
Thank you so much for all your help.

01:17:52.850 --> 01:17:56.952
- My pleasure. Good luck.
- Great help!

01:17:56.954 --> 01:18:00.090
Another happy customer. Wow.

01:18:28.686 --> 01:18:31.121

You're a smart girl.

01:18:47.371 --> 01:18:51.409
Just like your dad.
Very smart.

01:18:53.477 --> 01:18:57.712
I wasn't always
a very good father.

01:18:57.714 --> 01:19:01.183
Well, you're
an excellent grandpa.

01:19:01.185 --> 01:19:02.520
Well...

01:19:04.422 --> 01:19:06.622
How is everything?

01:19:06.624 --> 01:19:07.890
Very good food.

01:19:07.892 --> 01:19:09.828
Thank you, that's very kind
of you, sir.

01:19:10.861 --> 01:19:12.330
It's just that

01:19:13.297 --> 01:19:15.096
it all comes in

01:19:15.098 --> 01:19:17.502
huge hunks.

01:19:20.504 --> 01:19:21.505
I mean...

01:19:24.674 --> 01:19:26.507
It's very hard...

01:19:26.509 --> 01:19:28.342
- Hard to handle.
- Yep.

01:19:28.344 --> 01:19:33.114
I know. The size of steaks these
days, it's just ridiculous.

01:19:33.116 --> 01:19:37.521
What about a pizza?
And I promise to have it cut up for you.

01:19:41.124 --> 01:19:44.428
That's great!
That's a great idea.

01:19:45.329 --> 01:19:49.797
You're a very nice man.

01:19:49.799 --> 01:19:52.402
- I think you're very nice, too.
- I agree.

01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:58.610
Always an honor to have
a veteran on board, sir.

01:25:03.813 --> 01:25:06.680
Oh, that's good thinking.

01:25:06.682 --> 01:25:08.516
- Grandpa?
- Yeah?

01:25:08.518 --> 01:25:11.955
- I have to take a wee.
- All right.

01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:16.757
I have to sit down

01:25:16.759 --> 01:25:19.260
on that toilet.

01:25:19.262 --> 01:25:21.833
Okay, sit down, then.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.236
Oh! Oh.

01:25:29.806 --> 01:25:31.642
Well, you should sit down.

01:25:33.477 --> 01:25:34.609
Yes, Grandpa.

01:25:34.611 --> 01:25:37.679
Maggie used to sit down, too.

01:25:37.681 --> 01:25:39.784
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:25:41.118 --> 01:25:42.884
<i>No one's there.</i>

01:25:42.886 --> 01:25:44.284
- <i>Poop on them.</i>
- <i>Yeah. Poop on them.</i>

01:25:44.286 --> 01:25:45.354
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

01:25:45.356 --> 01:25:46.954
<i>Or maybe the day after.</i>

01:25:46.956 --> 01:25:49.026
- <i>Love you. Bye.</i>
- <i>Bye.</i>

01:25:49.593 --> 01:25:51.426
Very sweet.

01:25:51.428 --> 01:25:55.831
So your dad and your daughter
are on a train, having a day out.

01:25:55.833 --> 01:25:57.832
- That's right.
- Yes, and you're gonna find that train.

01:25:57.834 --> 01:26:00.935
Madam, there are a lot of
trains in this country.

01:26:00.937 --> 01:26:03.104
You know, all sort of
whizzing around.

01:26:03.106 --> 01:26:04.271
Or not.

01:26:04.273 --> 01:26:06.341
Depends on who runs
the rail franchise.

01:26:06.343 --> 01:26:08.576
As I explained,
our daughter is 10 years old.

01:26:08.578 --> 01:26:11.679
And her grandfather has dementia.
He's very forgetful.

01:26:11.681 --> 01:26:13.215
Happens to us all, madam.

01:26:13.217 --> 01:26:15.250
This morning I forgot
where I'd left my car keys.

01:26:15.252 --> 01:26:17.885
My wife says I'd lose my head if
it wasn't screwed on, you know?

01:26:17.887 --> 01:26:22.290
Are you saying you're not gonna help us
find our child? Is that what you're saying?

01:26:22.292 --> 01:26:24.460
I've contacted
the British Transport Police.

01:26:24.462 --> 01:26:29.230
Okay? But a child on a trip with her
grandpa is not really a priority.

01:26:29.232 --> 01:26:32.201
The Transport Police will let us
know as soon as they've been located.

01:26:32.203 --> 01:26:34.101
- But look, there are a lot...
- A lot of trains.

01:26:34.103 --> 01:26:36.104
- Yes, you said.
- Right. A lot of trains, look,

01:26:36.106 --> 01:26:37.973
we'll call the credit card companies,
maybe they'll be cooperative.

01:26:37.975 --> 01:26:40.841
- Thank you.
- Smart thinking, sir. Very smart.

01:26:40.843 --> 01:26:43.114
Do let us know
if you ever need a job.

01:27:05.503 --> 01:27:06.704
Hello?

01:27:09.106 --> 01:27:11.042
Hello?

01:27:16.746 --> 01:27:17.945
Who's there?

01:27:17.947 --> 01:27:20.015
It's the prime minister
of Sweden.

01:27:20.884 --> 01:27:22.417
I really got to take a leak.

01:27:22.419 --> 01:27:23.984
Oh, no...

01:27:23.986 --> 01:27:27.088
Uh, Prime Minister,
you...

01:27:27.090 --> 01:27:28.189
This is not

01:27:28.191 --> 01:27:30.725
a good restroom for you,
Prime Minister.

01:27:30.727 --> 01:27:33.163
Hey, buddy.
Just open the door.

01:27:38.701 --> 01:27:39.971
Um...

01:27:48.212 --> 01:27:50.511
It doesn't work.

01:27:50.513 --> 01:27:53.047
Just turn the lock
to the left.

01:27:53.049 --> 01:27:54.651
- The left?
- Yeah.

01:27:56.085 --> 01:27:58.420
Turn the lock to the left.

01:27:58.422 --> 01:28:00.121
- Is it the police?
- No.

01:28:00.123 --> 01:28:02.960
It's the Swedish
prime minister.

01:28:03.694 --> 01:28:05.594
We should tidy up a bit.

01:28:05.596 --> 01:28:09.100
Come on, guys. I'm joking.
I'm Mickey. I'm the janitor.

01:28:13.704 --> 01:28:15.837
Oh...

01:28:15.839 --> 01:28:18.739
You're the girl
that stopped that train.

01:28:18.741 --> 01:28:20.175
Oh, and you're the...

01:28:20.177 --> 01:28:22.377
You're the grandfather
with the Alzheimer's?

01:28:22.379 --> 01:28:24.578
"Alzheimer"? Who?

01:28:24.580 --> 01:28:25.846
Who has Alzheimer's?

01:28:25.848 --> 01:28:27.582
Are they looking for us?

01:28:27.584 --> 01:28:30.385
Oh, sweetheart,
this is Bolzano.

01:28:30.387 --> 01:28:32.988
You stopped the London
to Venice Express.

01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:35.122
That makes you headline news.

01:28:35.124 --> 01:28:38.025
Well, I had to do it.
Or I'd have lost my grandpa.

01:28:38.027 --> 01:28:39.827
Well, then,
it's perfectly reasonable.

01:28:39.829 --> 01:28:42.697
Who has Alzheimer's?

01:28:42.699 --> 01:28:44.933
Wait. You're American.

01:28:44.935 --> 01:28:47.801
- I sure as hell am.
- Then what are you doing here?

01:28:47.803 --> 01:28:49.136
I promised to leave

01:28:49.138 --> 01:28:50.872
if they made
that nincompoop president.

01:28:50.874 --> 01:28:53.074
So I left.

01:28:53.076 --> 01:28:56.510
I'm actually working on
a secret plan to free Melania.

01:28:56.512 --> 01:28:57.811
I think she'd like that.

01:28:57.813 --> 01:29:00.280
- Where are you from?
- Connecticut.

01:29:00.282 --> 01:29:03.484
But now we live in London.
We immigrated.

01:29:03.486 --> 01:29:05.121
Can you please help us?

01:29:05.655 --> 01:29:07.255
Of course.

01:29:07.257 --> 01:29:09.826
We immigrants,
we gotta stick together.

01:29:31.914 --> 01:29:32.980
What are you doing?

01:29:32.982 --> 01:29:34.149
I can't sleep.

01:29:34.151 --> 01:29:36.417
Yeah, I know. I can't either.

01:29:36.419 --> 01:29:39.621
Hey, are you still
looking for that honey?

01:29:39.623 --> 01:29:40.825
Yeah.

01:29:43.259 --> 01:29:45.226
Oh, my goodness!

01:29:45.228 --> 01:29:46.827
What a rascal!

01:29:46.829 --> 01:29:49.430
I must have asked him a hundred
times if he had seen my honey.

01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:51.766
You want to know
what he said?

01:29:51.768 --> 01:29:53.234
What did he say?

01:29:53.236 --> 01:29:55.973
He said,
"I'm allergic to honey."

01:30:01.779 --> 01:30:02.877
What a mess.

01:30:02.879 --> 01:30:04.181
You want a whiskey?

01:30:06.583 --> 01:30:08.917
It's nice to be nice
to each other again.

01:30:08.919 --> 01:30:11.052
You think we fight
more than other couples do?

01:30:11.054 --> 01:30:12.421
- Yes.
- You do?

01:30:12.423 --> 01:30:14.154
Yes, I think
we definitely fight

01:30:14.156 --> 01:30:15.556
a lot more than other couples.

01:30:15.558 --> 01:30:16.757
Why is that?

01:30:16.759 --> 01:30:18.627
It's our parents' fault,
I guess.

01:30:18.629 --> 01:30:21.162
- You know what I think?
- What do you think?

01:30:21.164 --> 01:30:23.530
I think it's because
we care for each other.

01:30:23.532 --> 01:30:24.966
And that's why.

01:30:26.771 --> 01:30:29.069
- Who is it?
- Nothing. It's not her.

01:30:29.071 --> 01:30:30.805
- Who is it?
- It's Serge.

01:30:30.807 --> 01:30:32.239
- Serge?
- Yep.

01:30:32.241 --> 01:30:34.775
- Serge.
- Yes, he says to say hi.

01:30:34.777 --> 01:30:36.010
He says to say hi.

01:30:36.012 --> 01:30:37.345
Yes, you can read it
if you want.

01:30:37.347 --> 01:30:40.882
Oh. "Hi, Serge.
How's your jaw, asswipe?"

01:30:40.884 --> 01:30:42.484
Stop it.
That's not funny.

01:30:42.486 --> 01:30:44.219
Poor Serge
is having a terrible time.

01:30:44.221 --> 01:30:46.054
- "Poor Serge is having a terrible time"?
- Yes.

01:30:46.056 --> 01:30:49.493
His wife's had him transferred
to the Huopalahti office.

01:30:50.427 --> 01:30:51.426
She had him transferred?

01:30:51.428 --> 01:30:53.627
Yes, her father
owns the company.

01:30:53.629 --> 01:30:55.329
Where's Huopalalalapah?

01:30:55.331 --> 01:30:59.533
- Huopalahti is outside Helsinki.
- Good.

01:30:59.535 --> 01:31:02.336
Yeah, I thought you might quite
like that piece of information.

01:31:02.338 --> 01:31:05.340
How come
you didn't get transferred?

01:31:05.342 --> 01:31:07.909
Turns out that
I was just the last

01:31:07.911 --> 01:31:09.778
in quite a long
string of indiscretions.

01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:13.448
Aw,
that must feel really horrible.

01:31:13.450 --> 01:31:16.184
- Almost kind of humiliating.
- No. Not really, no.

01:31:16.186 --> 01:31:18.752
- You sure?
- I'm fine. I hate you.

01:31:18.754 --> 01:31:21.088
- No, you don't.
- I do. I really do. I hate you.

01:31:21.090 --> 01:31:23.591
- No, you don't. You love me.
- I hate... I don't.

01:31:23.593 --> 01:31:25.159
No, I love Serge.

01:31:25.161 --> 01:31:27.162
- No, you love me.
- I hate you.

01:31:27.164 --> 01:31:29.433
- I hate you so much.
- You love me.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.935
- You love me.
- I love you a tiny bit.

01:31:33.937 --> 01:31:35.103
Hi, I'm Mickey.

01:31:35.105 --> 01:31:36.805
I'm from Schenectady,
New York.

01:31:36.807 --> 01:31:38.773
Now I live here in Bolzano.

01:31:38.775 --> 01:31:40.742
I was in stocks,
now I'm a janitor.

01:31:40.744 --> 01:31:42.176
Just get to the point, Mickey.

01:31:42.178 --> 01:31:45.113
Anyway. This is to say,
dear Nick and, uh...

01:31:45.115 --> 01:31:46.448
What's your mother
called again?

01:31:46.450 --> 01:31:47.515
Sandra.

01:31:47.517 --> 01:31:48.716
Dear Nick and Sandra,

01:31:48.718 --> 01:31:50.452
your daughter has asked me
to let you know

01:31:50.454 --> 01:31:53.554
that she and Amadeus here
are doing great

01:31:53.556 --> 01:31:54.922
and you mustn't worry.

01:31:54.924 --> 01:31:56.358
As soon as they get
to the City of Love,

01:31:56.360 --> 01:31:58.158
she will give you a call.
Go pick them up.

01:31:58.160 --> 01:31:59.860
"City of Love"?

01:31:59.862 --> 01:32:01.930
- What's wrong with that?
- It's cheesy.

01:32:01.932 --> 01:32:03.430
Just do it again
and say Venice.

01:32:03.432 --> 01:32:06.033
Oh, no, <i>bella.</i>
I'm a one-take kind of guy.

01:32:06.035 --> 01:32:07.903
Besides, my hair looks
great in that shot.

01:32:07.905 --> 01:32:10.872
Wait.

01:32:12.375 --> 01:32:15.311
- Did... Did you just send it?
- Yeah.

01:32:18.514 --> 01:32:19.814
Wake up.

01:32:19.816 --> 01:32:21.149
<i>You weren't
supposed to send it</i>

01:32:21.151 --> 01:32:22.683
until we'd actually
gone there

01:32:22.685 --> 01:32:25.019
because now they're gonna
know where we're going!

01:32:25.021 --> 01:32:26.520
I... I just said
"City of Love."

01:32:26.522 --> 01:32:29.123
That could be Paris
as well as Venice.

01:32:29.125 --> 01:32:33.060
Right, so I'm traveling
from London to Paris

01:32:33.062 --> 01:32:34.895
via South Tyrol?

01:32:34.897 --> 01:32:37.832
Why not? I mean, you go from
Austin to Seattle via New York.

01:32:37.834 --> 01:32:39.035
What?

01:32:40.536 --> 01:32:43.037
- Oh. There he is. Hey!
- <i>Venice?</i>

01:32:43.039 --> 01:32:45.172
Our daughter
has very expensive taste.

01:32:45.174 --> 01:32:46.774
I wonder
where that comes from.

01:32:46.776 --> 01:32:48.913
- Your side.
- Yeah?

01:32:49.812 --> 01:32:50.979
What is that?

01:32:50.981 --> 01:32:52.381
Eh, I brought
the cavalry. Mmm.

01:32:52.383 --> 01:32:53.314
Hey!

01:32:53.316 --> 01:32:55.484
<i>Buenas noches, amigos.</i>

01:32:55.486 --> 01:32:57.853
<i>Buenos dias.
"Noches"</i> is night.

01:32:57.855 --> 01:32:59.453
I don't see a moon, do you?

01:32:59.455 --> 01:33:02.189
Cavalry?

01:33:02.191 --> 01:33:04.091
Okay, Professor. Huh.

01:33:04.093 --> 01:33:05.961
So these are
our master criminals?

01:33:05.963 --> 01:33:07.194
Yeah, this is them.

01:33:07.196 --> 01:33:08.529
I am Murali,
your getaway driver.

01:33:08.531 --> 01:33:10.297
Better get in the back
of the truck now.

01:33:10.299 --> 01:33:11.666
Why can't we
sit in the front?

01:33:11.668 --> 01:33:13.902
Because you'll be seen.
And look at me.

01:33:13.904 --> 01:33:15.235
I will be controlled for sure.

01:33:15.237 --> 01:33:16.703
<i>Avanti, avanti.</i>

01:33:16.705 --> 01:33:18.238
We've to get going before
they close the borders.

01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:20.675
They don't have borders
in the EU anymore.

01:33:20.677 --> 01:33:22.210
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

01:33:22.212 --> 01:33:25.145
Come on.

01:33:25.147 --> 01:33:26.547
Good luck, my friend.

01:33:26.549 --> 01:33:28.815
I hope you and your grandpa
make it to Venice.

01:33:28.817 --> 01:33:30.484
Thank you for everything.

01:33:30.486 --> 01:33:32.086
- Stay safe.
- Okay.

01:33:32.088 --> 01:33:33.289
Okay?

01:33:45.267 --> 01:33:47.635
Ugh. It smells
horrible in here.

01:33:47.637 --> 01:33:49.503
Oh! I love the smell.

01:33:49.505 --> 01:33:53.507
Oh, you're such
a lovely girl, aren't you?

01:33:53.509 --> 01:33:55.210
How can you tell it's a girl?

01:33:55.212 --> 01:33:57.811
I'm a veterinarian, remember?

01:33:57.813 --> 01:34:00.113
I can tell by her face.

01:34:02.151 --> 01:34:03.354
But...

01:34:04.954 --> 01:34:07.056
She's got balls.

01:34:07.590 --> 01:34:08.723
Where?

01:34:08.725 --> 01:34:10.891
Certainly not on her face,
that's for sure.

01:34:10.893 --> 01:34:12.827
Oh, shit! The pigs!

01:34:12.829 --> 01:34:14.762
What did I tell you?

01:34:14.764 --> 01:34:16.767
- What's going on?
- Police!

01:34:17.866 --> 01:34:19.770
- Shit.
- Shit.

01:34:25.008 --> 01:34:26.241
Hello,
good afternoon.

01:34:26.243 --> 01:34:27.574
What can I
do for you, officers?

01:34:27.576 --> 01:34:29.777
You can hand him
your driver's license

01:34:29.779 --> 01:34:31.246
and the vehicle documents.

01:34:31.248 --> 01:34:33.348
- You heard him.
- Oh, definitely, of course.

01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:35.248
Hey, whoa.

01:34:35.250 --> 01:34:38.655
You're not talking back
to the chief, eh? No.

01:34:40.656 --> 01:34:42.092
What have you
got back there?

01:34:42.926 --> 01:34:44.391
- Oh, sheep.
- Sheep?

01:34:44.393 --> 01:34:45.693
Baa!

01:34:47.062 --> 01:34:48.128
What did you just say?

01:34:48.130 --> 01:34:49.764
Baa!

01:34:49.766 --> 01:34:53.033
Hey, you don't
"baa" to me, <i>capito?</i>

01:34:53.035 --> 01:34:54.135
All right. So can I go?

01:34:54.137 --> 01:34:55.403
No, of course you can't.

01:34:55.405 --> 01:34:57.671
Step out of the
car and open up.

01:34:59.308 --> 01:35:00.841
Oh, oh. Actually,
I don't think it would be a great idea

01:35:00.843 --> 01:35:02.042
to disturb them right now.

01:35:02.044 --> 01:35:04.414
Out of the vehicle
and open up.

01:35:08.584 --> 01:35:09.685
Shit!

01:35:14.089 --> 01:35:17.292
Why is the ledge down?
I could write you a ticket for that.

01:35:17.294 --> 01:35:19.163
Must have happened
when you stopped me.

01:35:21.731 --> 01:35:23.167
Damn clever, that girl.

01:35:24.234 --> 01:35:25.533
Oh, that sheep, I mean.

01:35:25.535 --> 01:35:26.967
One of them is
bloody clever, I know it.

01:35:26.969 --> 01:35:28.470
Just haven't worked out
which one it is yet.

01:35:28.472 --> 01:35:30.037
But I call you first
when I find out.

01:35:30.039 --> 01:35:31.104

01:35:31.106 --> 01:35:32.908

01:36:32.267 --> 01:36:34.935
Uh, we're not really sure.

01:36:34.937 --> 01:36:36.238
Okay, let's see.

01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:37.904
- We only have the suites left.
- Okay.

01:36:37.906 --> 01:36:39.674
That will be 1,800 euros.

01:36:39.676 --> 01:36:41.743
Are you joking? Come on,
let's go somewhere else.

01:36:41.745 --> 01:36:43.577
Honey, no, no,
we'll stay here.

01:36:43.579 --> 01:36:44.578
- This is ridiculous!
- Honey, we can handle it.

01:36:44.580 --> 01:36:45.846
Just pretend it's lira.

01:36:49.052 --> 01:36:51.452
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Thank you so much.

01:36:51.454 --> 01:36:53.489
- Enjoy your stay.
- Thank you.

01:37:01.463 --> 01:37:02.729
We've run out of bread.

01:37:02.731 --> 01:37:05.533
Look at all these lines!

01:37:05.535 --> 01:37:09.770
How's anybody supposed
to find their way around this?

01:37:09.772 --> 01:37:11.072
We can share this.

01:37:11.074 --> 01:37:12.407
Oh...

01:37:12.409 --> 01:37:15.176
You can have it.
I'm in the mood for sheep.

01:37:15.178 --> 01:37:17.144
- Sheep?
- See him?

01:37:17.146 --> 01:37:19.314
- We could catch one.
- No, Grandpa.

01:37:19.316 --> 01:37:21.349
We're not having any sheep.

01:37:21.351 --> 01:37:23.685
- A little sheep?
- No.

01:37:23.687 --> 01:37:26.287
- A half a little one?
- No!

01:37:26.289 --> 01:37:28.355
- A half of a little teeny...
- No.

01:37:28.357 --> 01:37:31.592
A little teeny itsy-bitsy one?

01:37:31.594 --> 01:37:32.961
No, Grandpa.

01:37:32.963 --> 01:37:34.662
A little itsy-bitsy teeny...

01:37:34.664 --> 01:37:37.631
Here. You can have
half of this.

01:37:37.633 --> 01:37:39.969
I don't like pomegranates.

01:37:45.909 --> 01:37:47.311
Grandpa?

01:37:48.378 --> 01:37:50.912
Are you scared of being dead?

01:37:50.914 --> 01:37:51.915
Nope.

01:37:52.949 --> 01:37:54.384
I think I am.

01:37:55.218 --> 01:37:57.251
You still have

01:37:57.253 --> 01:38:01.756
a day or two
before it's your turn.

01:38:01.758 --> 01:38:03.757
No, I think...

01:38:03.759 --> 01:38:06.562
I think I'm scared
of you dying.

01:38:08.998 --> 01:38:11.332
Don't be, because

01:38:11.334 --> 01:38:15.805
Grandma and I'll
always be up there,

01:38:17.339 --> 01:38:20.341
watching over you.

01:38:20.343 --> 01:38:24.278
And we'll be so proud of you.

01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:27.046
Any time you miss me,

01:38:27.048 --> 01:38:29.783
all you have to do is

01:38:29.785 --> 01:38:31.387
look up there.

01:38:36.191 --> 01:38:37.958
Did you say something?

01:38:40.763 --> 01:38:44.567
I just said
I love you, Grandpa.

01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:00.650
<i>Ciao, bella.</i>

01:39:24.005 --> 01:39:25.405
Can I help you?

01:39:25.407 --> 01:39:26.940
We're hungry.

01:39:26.942 --> 01:39:30.010
Well, I would love to give
those tomatoes to you,

01:39:30.012 --> 01:39:33.782
but they're for
the farmers' market in Venice.

01:39:33.784 --> 01:39:36.620
Come inside. Let's find you
something to eat.

01:40:07.249 --> 01:40:09.617
Where are the tomatoes?

01:40:09.619 --> 01:40:12.752
I was looking forward
to tomato salad.

01:40:12.754 --> 01:40:15.023
The tomatoes were for
the market, Mr. Ross.

01:40:15.025 --> 01:40:17.791
I know a joke
about farmers' market.

01:40:17.793 --> 01:40:21.162
A nun goes
to this farmer's market,

01:40:21.164 --> 01:40:22.863
he's selling vegetables,

01:40:22.865 --> 01:40:24.832
and she says to the farmer,

01:40:24.834 --> 01:40:26.967
"I would like a cucumber."

01:40:26.969 --> 01:40:31.505
And the farmer says,
"Well, take two cucumbers."

01:40:31.507 --> 01:40:35.176
And she says,
"Why two cucumbers?"

01:40:35.178 --> 01:40:37.644
The farmer says to the nun,

01:40:37.646 --> 01:40:41.150
"Well, then you'll have
another one to eat!"

01:40:48.290 --> 01:40:50.657
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

01:40:50.659 --> 01:40:54.694
Well, if she eats one,

01:40:54.696 --> 01:40:58.165
then she'll have the other
she can use...

01:40:58.167 --> 01:40:59.434
To eat the next day.

01:40:59.436 --> 01:41:00.568
Ah...

01:41:04.874 --> 01:41:06.907
Um, so what do you guys
do here all day?

01:41:06.909 --> 01:41:09.842
- Could I explain my joke, please?
- No, Grandpa.

01:41:09.844 --> 01:41:13.146
Um, is it true that you
are not allowed to have sex?

01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:20.688
That is right, my child.

01:41:20.690 --> 01:41:22.189
We live in chastity.

01:41:22.191 --> 01:41:25.060
See, that's what I was
saying about the cucumber!

01:41:25.460 --> 01:41:26.663
Ow!

01:41:29.031 --> 01:41:31.364
What's chastity?

01:41:31.366 --> 01:41:34.801
Well, we abstain
from loving a man,

01:41:34.803 --> 01:41:37.304
and we do not allow ourselves
to be loved by one.

01:41:37.306 --> 01:41:38.506
Mmm-hmm.

01:41:38.508 --> 01:41:40.010
We reserve that place for God.

01:41:41.544 --> 01:41:42.976
So...

01:41:42.978 --> 01:41:46.482
You are, sort of,
all married to God?

01:41:47.650 --> 01:41:51.018
Yes, you could
say that, my child.

01:41:51.020 --> 01:41:54.191
So, no one can get jealous
or cheat on each other?

01:41:57.959 --> 01:42:01.161
Is it okay with you
if my parents come here?

01:42:01.163 --> 01:42:02.595
Well, yes, of course.

01:42:02.597 --> 01:42:04.732
But why do you
ask that, my child?

01:42:04.734 --> 01:42:07.536
I just think they could
learn a lot from you all.

01:42:13.243 --> 01:42:15.141
In purgatory,

01:42:15.143 --> 01:42:18.445
we get the chance
to have our sins forgiven.

01:42:18.447 --> 01:42:20.581
To make ourselves pure again.

01:42:20.583 --> 01:42:24.217
So that God can
receive us in heaven.

01:42:24.219 --> 01:42:27.054
- Do you believe in heaven?
- Of course.

01:42:27.056 --> 01:42:30.692
Only heaven makes
our lives complete.

01:42:30.694 --> 01:42:32.859
And when we die,

01:42:32.861 --> 01:42:36.632
we all live there
together with God.

01:42:37.967 --> 01:42:42.103
Do you think my grandpa
will go to heaven?

01:42:42.105 --> 01:42:45.538
From what you've told me
about your grandfather,

01:42:45.540 --> 01:42:47.276
I'm sure he will.

01:42:48.143 --> 01:42:49.376
Really?

01:42:49.378 --> 01:42:50.545
Yes.

01:42:50.547 --> 01:42:53.648
You know, Matilda,

01:42:53.650 --> 01:42:56.585
what you are doing
for your grandfather

01:42:57.520 --> 01:42:59.886
is extraordinary.

01:42:59.888 --> 01:43:02.823
You are a very special girl.

01:43:06.596 --> 01:43:08.628
Are you looking
for someone, Grandpa?

01:43:08.630 --> 01:43:10.364
Yes.

01:43:10.366 --> 01:43:12.134
Margaret. Have you seen her?

01:43:13.503 --> 01:43:16.503
It's my...
It's my grandma. She, uh...

01:43:16.505 --> 01:43:18.074
She went to heaven.

01:43:21.377 --> 01:43:24.211
Come on, I'll help you.

01:43:24.213 --> 01:43:26.616
- That's right.
- Grandma?

01:43:27.484 --> 01:43:28.685
Margaret?

01:43:30.253 --> 01:43:31.788
Grandma?

01:43:33.289 --> 01:43:35.624
- Grandma?
- Where is she?

01:43:36.225 --> 01:43:37.694
We'll find her.

01:43:40.728 --> 01:43:43.732
Grandpa, I found her.

01:43:47.203 --> 01:43:48.571

01:43:49.137 --> 01:43:50.639

01:43:55.745 --> 01:43:59.413

I couldn't follow you.

01:43:59.415 --> 01:44:01.549
And I've been...

01:44:01.551 --> 01:44:05.088
I've been
looking for you for so...

01:44:05.820 --> 01:44:08.256
So long.

01:44:12.195 --> 01:44:13.929
You're so beautiful.

01:44:16.598 --> 01:44:19.902

But, <i>signorina,</i> the booking
was for two days ago.

01:46:48.851 --> 01:46:50.518
Now, the room is gone.

01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:53.019
We got delayed.
And my grandpa, he's really tired.

01:46:53.021 --> 01:46:54.889
Can we please
have a different room?

01:46:54.891 --> 01:46:57.591
But we only have
one suite left, and, um...

01:46:58.660 --> 01:47:00.060
It's quite expensive.

01:47:00.062 --> 01:47:02.662
That's okay.
I have Grandpa's credit card.

01:47:02.664 --> 01:47:07.868
Hmm. Well, then,
it's 2,400 euro.

01:47:07.870 --> 01:47:09.239
The PIN number, sir.

01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:13.243
Grandpa?

01:47:16.712 --> 01:47:18.248
Battle of Verdun.

01:47:27.356 --> 01:47:29.989
<i>Ecco.</i> Room number 19, sir.

01:47:33.795 --> 01:47:35.295
Um...

01:47:35.297 --> 01:47:37.631
Because they want to
look like their mothers.

01:47:37.633 --> 01:47:38.698
Grandpa!

01:47:42.370 --> 01:47:44.337
My friend Nerdy
told me that one!

01:47:44.339 --> 01:47:46.172
- That's a good one.
- I know.

01:47:48.776 --> 01:47:50.411
Number 19.

01:47:50.413 --> 01:47:51.811
Just like their mothers!

01:47:59.289 --> 01:48:00.520
Who...

01:48:00.522 --> 01:48:02.088
Who are you?

01:48:04.694 --> 01:48:07.830
There's somebody here in the mirror.
It's watching us.

01:48:08.931 --> 01:48:10.967
He does everything I do.

01:48:12.801 --> 01:48:14.202
You see?

01:48:14.204 --> 01:48:15.135
That's...

01:48:15.137 --> 01:48:16.572
That's you, Grandpa,

01:48:17.906 --> 01:48:19.506
and that's me.

01:48:19.508 --> 01:48:21.878
It's our reflections.

01:48:26.950 --> 01:48:28.348
What?

01:48:28.350 --> 01:48:29.451
Go away!

01:48:31.654 --> 01:48:33.019
- Go!
- Um, Grandpa?

01:48:33.021 --> 01:48:35.488
- Get out!
- Better to use this.

01:48:35.490 --> 01:48:38.594
You have to use
the other half. Here.

01:48:46.735 --> 01:48:49.569
I don't like this guy.

01:48:49.571 --> 01:48:50.636
Ta-da!

01:49:01.417 --> 01:49:02.584
You know...

01:49:04.186 --> 01:49:08.823
I learn so much from you.

01:49:10.892 --> 01:49:13.596
That was the funnest day,

01:49:14.730 --> 01:49:18.134
the most coolest day
of my life, really.

01:49:19.368 --> 01:49:20.835
Thank you.

01:49:20.837 --> 01:49:23.836
Thank you so much, Grandpa.

01:49:23.838 --> 01:49:25.872
Yeah, me too.

01:49:39.655 --> 01:49:42.456
<i>Fourteen hotels and
no one's heard of anything.</i>

01:49:43.691 --> 01:49:45.958
Are we sure they were
even going to Venice?

01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:47.127
I'm trying to remember

01:49:47.129 --> 01:49:49.195
what was the name
of the place

01:49:49.197 --> 01:49:50.930
where he stayed
when he came here

01:49:50.932 --> 01:49:52.265
with my mom
on their honeymoon.

01:49:52.267 --> 01:49:55.536
Was it the Lido?
Was it St. Mark's Square?

01:49:55.538 --> 01:49:57.904
To tell you the truth,
I kind of zoned out

01:49:57.906 --> 01:49:59.508
when he would go on about it.

01:50:00.976 --> 01:50:04.110
As awful as these
few days have been,

01:50:04.112 --> 01:50:06.581
I feel like we're on
the same side again.

01:50:07.917 --> 01:50:09.750
Like we used to be.

01:50:09.752 --> 01:50:11.254
We're a team.

01:50:22.196 --> 01:50:25.067
Oh...

01:50:27.069 --> 01:50:28.835
Do you hear the birds?

01:50:32.406 --> 01:50:34.610
Oh, that doesn't
sound good.

01:50:49.959 --> 01:50:51.091
Hey...

01:50:51.093 --> 01:50:53.226
You, I heard you cry.

01:50:53.228 --> 01:50:54.461
Are you sick?

01:50:54.463 --> 01:50:57.197
I can help.
I'm a veterinarian.

01:50:58.534 --> 01:50:59.899
The bird is sick.

01:50:59.901 --> 01:51:01.635
Yeah, he's a little green.

01:51:04.206 --> 01:51:05.471
You get it?

01:51:06.409 --> 01:51:09.275
I made a joke like you.

01:51:09.277 --> 01:51:11.877
Well, not like yours.
Your joke was so funny, sir.

01:51:11.879 --> 01:51:13.012
I told everybody here.

01:51:13.014 --> 01:51:15.114
Which way is the beach?

01:51:15.116 --> 01:51:17.451
Oh, the beach is at the Lido.

01:51:17.453 --> 01:51:19.485
- Is everything okay, sir?
- Yes.

01:51:19.487 --> 01:51:21.822
Can I help you with something?

01:51:21.824 --> 01:51:23.724
Yeah, but you can't go there now.

01:51:23.726 --> 01:51:25.428
It's the middle
of the night! Sir!

01:51:34.402 --> 01:51:36.836

seen my grandpa?

Uh... Grand... Grand...

01:51:42.210 --> 01:51:44.912
- The one with the dog, right?
- Yes, yes.

01:51:51.154 --> 01:51:53.720
- Left. Right.
- Eh...

01:51:53.722 --> 01:51:55.655
Okay? You go out...

01:51:55.657 --> 01:51:56.724
Eh...

01:51:56.726 --> 01:51:57.727

- Gooey and wet.

<i>Before we
flew back to London,</i>

01:56:40.842 --> 01:56:42.475
<i>we stayed up until midnight</i>

01:56:42.477 --> 01:56:45.045
<i>to watch the big
Redentore fireworks.</i>

01:56:45.047 --> 01:56:46.645
<i>We had a ball.</i>

01:56:46.647 --> 01:56:49.082
<i>Although, Grandpa thought</i>

01:56:49.084 --> 01:56:50.684
<i>this show was nothing</i>

01:56:50.686 --> 01:56:52.955
<i>compared to his fireworks
at the garden party.</i>

01:56:56.924 --> 01:56:58.957
<i>Nine months later,
I got a little brother.</i>

01:56:58.959 --> 01:57:02.327
<i>Mom said we should name
him Amadeus after Grandpa.</i>

01:57:02.329 --> 01:57:04.730
<i>I don't think Grandpa really
understood that, though.</i>

01:57:04.732 --> 01:57:07.567
<i>He kept asking
what the baby was called</i>

01:57:07.569 --> 01:57:08.902
<i>and where he came from.</i>

01:57:08.904 --> 01:57:10.702
<i>But I think Grandpa
did understand</i>

01:57:10.704 --> 01:57:13.105
<i>that Mom and Dad had
more time for him</i>

01:57:13.107 --> 01:57:16.710
<i>because they always kept their
promise and tried to work less.</i>

01:57:16.712 --> 01:57:20.646
<i>I always played Grandpa his favorite
songs from when he was young.</i>

01:57:20.648 --> 01:57:23.716
<i>Dr. Edwards told me music
has an unmatched power</i>

01:57:23.718 --> 01:57:25.184
<i>to completely transform</i>

01:57:25.186 --> 01:57:27.954
<i>the lives
of people with Alzheimer's.</i>

01:57:27.956 --> 01:57:31.224
<i>Music can really heal
them for a moment,</i>

01:57:31.226 --> 01:57:33.493
<i>and bring them back to us.</i>

01:57:33.495 --> 01:57:34.827
<i>Grandpa stayed with us
for a while</i>

01:57:34.829 --> 01:57:36.462
<i>after our trip to Venice.</i>

01:57:36.464 --> 01:57:39.233
<i>We had a caregiver come in
and help us with him.</i>

01:57:39.235 --> 01:57:41.201
<i>Grandpa liked her a lot.</i>

01:57:41.203 --> 01:57:43.804
<i>But eventually,
she decided to leave us.</i>

01:57:43.806 --> 01:57:46.072
<i>Grandpa liked
her blouse too much.</i>

01:57:46.074 --> 01:57:48.274
<i>When Grandpa
went into the home,</i>

01:57:48.276 --> 01:57:49.775
<i>we'd often visit him.</i>

01:57:49.777 --> 01:57:51.676
<i>Mom usually got him
the honey ice cream</i>

01:57:51.678 --> 01:57:53.246
<i>he loved so much.</i>

01:57:53.248 --> 01:57:54.848
<i>Sometimes he liked it,</i>

01:57:54.850 --> 01:57:56.683
<i>and sometimes he thought
it was much too cold.</i>

01:57:56.685 --> 01:57:58.118
That's the son.

01:57:58.120 --> 01:57:59.719
I know.

01:57:59.721 --> 01:58:01.220
How would you know?

01:58:01.222 --> 01:58:03.290
Because he looks like my son.

01:58:03.292 --> 01:58:05.125
<i>Dr. Edwards told me</i>

01:58:05.127 --> 01:58:08.260
<i>Alzheimer's patients
feel more than we know.</i>

01:58:08.262 --> 01:58:09.863
<i>He said they need affection,</i>

01:58:09.865 --> 01:58:12.299
<i>so spending as much
time with them as possible</i>

01:58:12.301 --> 01:58:13.866
<i>is important.</i>

01:58:13.868 --> 01:58:16.235
<i>On our very last outing,
there was a huge storm.</i>

01:58:16.237 --> 01:58:19.573
<i>It was a massive downpour,
like heaven was crying.</i>

01:58:19.575 --> 01:58:21.174
<i>But we?</i>

01:58:21.176 --> 01:58:23.076
<i>We just sat
at our table in the garden</i>

01:58:23.078 --> 01:58:25.144
<i>and laughed.</i>

01:58:25.146 --> 01:58:28.081
<i>The next day,
his heart stopped beating.</i>

01:58:28.083 --> 01:58:30.716
<i>And I'm so happy that
I was there at that moment.</i>

There is a time to give
birth, and a time to die.

02:00:34.310 --> 02:00:37.342
A time to weep,
and a time to laugh.

02:00:37.344 --> 02:00:38.644
A time to embrace

02:00:38.646 --> 02:00:40.979
and a time to
be far from embraces.

02:00:40.981 --> 02:00:44.216
A time to be silent,
and a time to speak.

02:00:44.218 --> 02:00:45.217
A time to plant,

02:00:45.219 --> 02:00:47.453
and a time to
uproot the plant.

02:00:49.057 --> 02:00:50.890

02:00:50.892 --> 02:00:52.161
She didn't want
to see the burial.
