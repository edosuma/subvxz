WEBVTT

00:01.135 --> 00:04.241
- Hey, honey.
- You're just in time for breakfast.

00:04.305 --> 00:05.807
We should probably go light on the food.

00:05.873 --> 00:08.319
Something tells me we're not gonna
want to do this on a full stomach.

00:08.376 --> 00:11.880
I can't believe there's such a thing as autopsy camp.

00:11.946 --> 00:14.426
There is no such thing as autopsy camp.

00:14.482 --> 00:17.827
I had to trick Luke 'cause I'm actually
taking him to a ballroom dance class.

00:17.885 --> 00:19.455
He's been resisting,
but it's in his blood.

00:19.520 --> 00:23.058
I come from a long line of dancing Dunphys-
a kick line, actually.

00:25.426 --> 00:26.928
Come on. We don't want to be late...

00:26.994 --> 00:29.065
like the guy we're gonna see
on the table- Am I right?

00:29.130 --> 00:31.576
- Of corpse you are.
- Mom, can you take me driving?

00:31.632 --> 00:33.669
My test is coming up,
and I really need to practice.

00:33.734 --> 00:35.236
Oh, honey, I would...

00:35.302 --> 00:38.772
but I've got a big Closets and Blinds Union
meeting today.

00:38.839 --> 00:41.046
There is no Closets and Blinds Union.

00:41.108 --> 00:42.883
Driving with Alex is torture.

00:42.943 --> 00:45.617
She drives so slowly,
I have to be the only parent...

00:45.679 --> 00:47.625
who slams on the imaginary gas.

00:47.681 --> 00:50.127
Hey, I'm not doing anything.
I guess I could take her.

00:50.184 --> 00:52.323
Great! I'll go check the tire pressure
and the fluid levels.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.332
Fun! Can't wait. Be out in a sec.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.334
Okay, my rate just went up.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.631
All right, but this buys your time
and your silence.

00:58.692 --> 01:01.468
Alex can never know
how much I hate driving with her.

01:01.529 --> 01:04.703
Mmm, she's in a hurry today.

01:04.765 --> 01:07.041
Oh, that's just step one
of her nine-point safety test.

01:07.101 --> 01:10.082
Step two is checking the horn to make sure
checking the horn didn't break the horn.

01:11.338 --> 01:12.874
She should never drive.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.484
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:15.543 --> 01:17.580
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:17.645 --> 01:19.682
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:19.747 --> 01:21.658
♪ Hey, hey♪

01:21.715 --> 01:22.887
♪ Hey,♪♪

01:26.620 --> 01:28.429
Forget it. You tricked me.

01:28.489 --> 01:30.765
I'm sorry, buddy, but no son of mine's
going to high school...

01:30.825 --> 01:33.135
without at least knowing
how to do a proper box step.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.333
Trust me. Dancers always get the girls.

01:35.396 --> 01:37.672
Remember the great Kevin Bacon
from Footloose?

01:37.731 --> 01:40.075
- More like Foot Loser.
- Careful!

01:41.068 --> 01:42.570
All right. No more talking.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.946
- We're doing this.
- Ugh!

01:45.005 --> 01:48.578
You'll thank me someday. it gets better
when you find your signature move.

01:48.642 --> 01:51.316
They used to call me King of the Dips!

01:53.914 --> 01:57.259
Why can't we just repurpose some of
the stuff from Manny's party last night?

01:57.318 --> 02:00.265
We got half a cake left.
The balloons are fine.

02:00.321 --> 02:03.825
It's bad enough that both my sons
have to share the same birthday.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.461
At least they deserve their own party.

02:05.526 --> 02:07.028
You think Joe's
gonna mind day-old cake?

02:07.094 --> 02:09.404
He can't even eat it.
He's got three teeth.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.704
I'll remember that in 20 years
when you want cake.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.676
He doesn't even know
the party's for him.

02:13.734 --> 02:16.112
He understands more than you think.
Right, Andy?

02:16.170 --> 02:17.706
Who, F-Joe here?

02:17.771 --> 02:19.751
He is smart as a whip.

02:19.807 --> 02:22.720
When we play peek-a-boo,
half the time he's ahead of me.

02:22.776 --> 02:25.313
Not exactly Clash of the Titans.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.188
Manny, whose coat is that?

02:27.248 --> 02:29.694
Amy Martin left it here
last night after my party.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.026
I was getting
some pretty strong signals from her.

02:32.086 --> 02:35.431
I think she did it on purpose
so she'd have an excuse to come back.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.628
Or because she couldn't get out
fast enough.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.728
If she was a cartoon,
she'd have left her skin here.

02:39.793 --> 02:41.295
What does that mean?

02:41.362 --> 02:43.603
That Amy is out of his league.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.473
He always does this
and ends up getting hurt.

02:45.533 --> 02:47.035
You need to talk to him.

02:47.101 --> 02:49.809
- And say what?
- Tell him to go for girls he stands a chance with.

02:49.870 --> 02:51.713
I overheard him talking to Reuben.

02:51.772 --> 02:54.719
There's some girl that really likes him,
but of course Manny's not interested in her.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.311
He's got to go for the head cheerleader.

02:56.377 --> 02:59.449
- How do you know that Amy's the head-
- I overheard that too.

02:59.513 --> 03:02.960
For someone whose favorite words
at the movies are "What did he say?"...

03:03.017 --> 03:05.156
you overhear pretty good.

03:08.522 --> 03:12.402
Yes, Lily, I-I pinky-promise
that we'll be home in time for baby Joe's party.

03:12.459 --> 03:14.803
Mm-hmm. I am.
I'm touching it to the phone.

03:14.862 --> 03:18.241
Yeah, and butterfly kisses. Okay. Okay.

03:18.299 --> 03:21.007
Little girls- so excitable.

03:21.068 --> 03:24.572
I was wishing they had a gazebo,
and then they did!

03:24.638 --> 03:28.017
Ever since I was a little boy,
I have dreamed-

03:28.075 --> 03:30.988
dreamed of getting married
in a place exactly like this.

03:31.045 --> 03:32.353
So, what date were you looking at?

03:32.413 --> 03:34.552
March 28. That's the anniversary
of our first date.

03:34.615 --> 03:37.960
Oh, wait- Um, I'm sorry.
Is this price per person?

03:38.018 --> 03:40.020
Yes, excluding alcohol, cake and music.

03:40.087 --> 03:41.532
What's that? The Mennonite package?

03:41.589 --> 03:43.500
I think you'll find
our prices are competitive.

03:43.557 --> 03:44.968
- Mmm.
- Well, I'm ready to commit.

03:45.025 --> 03:47.631
Cam, Cam.

03:47.695 --> 03:50.938
I'm sorry.
Can-Can we have a moment, please?

03:50.998 --> 03:54.275
Okay. Well, let's hope he's not having
any last-minute jitters.

03:54.335 --> 03:56.508
You're not having
last-minute jitters, are you?

03:56.570 --> 03:58.811
No. No, but it's
a really large deposit...

03:58.872 --> 04:00.943
and I want to make sure
we're absolutely certain about this place.

04:01.008 --> 04:03.249
Well, I'm certain, and we've looked
at every possible venue.

04:03.310 --> 04:05.551
And Pepper was, by far,
the least snarky about this one.

04:05.613 --> 04:08.651
That's true. He doesn't throw
the word "adequate" around lightly.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.696
- Okay, okay. it's this place.
- Okay.

04:10.751 --> 04:13.698
Stop being so excited. We might be able
to get the price down a little bit.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.427
Okay. Okay. Poker face, poker face.

04:15.489 --> 04:17.196
- Now work on your poker voice.
- Poker voice.

04:18.524 --> 04:21.971
So, we do like it.
We're just not sure that we love it.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.531
Yeah, we're not sure we love it.

04:23.597 --> 04:26.168
That's a relief. Because someone
just called. The room is booked.

04:26.233 --> 04:27.610
- What?
- What? No, no, no!

04:27.668 --> 04:29.648
Wait. Are you playing hardball?
Because we're playing hardball!

04:29.703 --> 04:32.274
- We love it!
- Sorry.

04:32.339 --> 04:34.683
A young lady planning a sweet 16
just booked your date.

04:34.742 --> 04:38.884
After that, we don't have
another opening for... two months.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.654
No. No, it has to be on our anniversary.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.626
Wait, did Tracy McCoy book this room?

04:43.684 --> 04:47.393
Tracy McCoy's a student of mine.
Okay. I may have a plan.

04:47.454 --> 04:51.129
I am not having a wedding/
Hunger Games themed sweet 16 par-

04:51.191 --> 04:53.603
Oh, you're tapping your fingers.
You really do have a plan.

04:55.296 --> 04:57.333
Well, somebody smells good.

04:57.398 --> 04:59.708
- What perfume is that?
- Every perfume!

04:59.767 --> 05:03.442
Twenty of the sweatiest, geekiest girls
God ever fouled this planet with...

05:03.504 --> 05:05.711
and just me dancing with all of them.

05:05.773 --> 05:08.617
During the Charleston,
my hair got caught in one of their headgear.

05:08.676 --> 05:11.520
- Wow, Charleston on the first day?
- Last day!

05:11.578 --> 05:15.287
Just because you're a dancer doesn't mean
I have to be one too, cha-cha-cha.

05:15.349 --> 05:16.453
Damn it!

05:16.517 --> 05:19.157
I'm never gonna fall
for one of your lies again.

05:19.219 --> 05:22.291
Just take me to autopsy camp.

05:22.356 --> 05:25.166
Oh, shoot. Am I gonna get a ticket?

05:25.225 --> 05:28.468
If there's any justice,
it'll be a big one, two, three and four.

05:28.529 --> 05:29.564
Damn it!

05:31.198 --> 05:34.008
- License and registration, please.
- Absolutely. There you are.

05:34.068 --> 05:35.570
You know one of your taillights is out?

05:35.636 --> 05:38.242
No, I did not. What a ding-dong.

05:38.305 --> 05:41.149
- Wait right here.
- Will do. We'll be right here.

05:41.208 --> 05:43.313
This is what you get for lying to me.

05:43.377 --> 05:45.379
What choice did I have?
You used to be up for anything.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.392
Now, no matter what I suggest,
it's no, no, no.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.792
It's called growing up
and having your own interests...

05:49.850 --> 05:52.228
like the minister's daughter
in your precious Footloose.

05:52.286 --> 05:55.995
Wow. Using my own movie against me.

05:56.056 --> 05:58.662
- Let's hear it for the boy.
- Please step out of the car.

05:58.726 --> 06:01.002
- Oh, I believe you about the taillight.
- Out of the car!

06:01.061 --> 06:04.338
- Okay.
- I'm sorry, but I have to place you under arrest.

06:04.398 --> 06:06.139
Wait, what?

06:06.200 --> 06:09.340
A car registered to you has accumulated
18 unpaid parking violations...

06:09.403 --> 06:11.041
all on Campus Drive.

06:11.105 --> 06:12.584
Oh, my God.
Those are my daughter's tickets.

06:12.639 --> 06:14.243
He's got an answer for everything.

06:14.308 --> 06:17.152
I got to take you down to the station house.
You can ride up front with me.

06:17.211 --> 06:20.055
- Seriously, can't I just pay you for them now?
- At the station house, sir.

06:20.114 --> 06:23.254
Can we at least not drive by
Middle Earth Comics and Trampoline World?

06:23.317 --> 06:26.321
People look up to me in this town!

06:34.561 --> 06:36.165
No, honey, Luke's fine.

06:36.230 --> 06:37.732
And they won't take a credit card?

06:37.798 --> 06:40.108
No, it's 1 ,600, cash only.

06:40.167 --> 06:43.114
But, honey, it's Sunday. I can only get
a few hundred bucks from the A.T.M.

06:43.170 --> 06:47.141
- Sir, your time's up.
- Honey, just use the emergency cash.

06:47.207 --> 06:48.777
- Ticktock.
- B-but, Phil-

06:48.842 --> 06:52.380
- Got to go!
- No, honey- I forgot the hiding place! Phil?

06:52.446 --> 06:55.188
Phil has $1 ,000 hidden in the house...

06:55.249 --> 06:58.560
and he's made up a crazy mnemonic device
to remember the location...

06:58.619 --> 07:01.896
which he changes every month
to stay ahead of the bad guys.

07:03.557 --> 07:05.059
What bad guys?

07:05.125 --> 07:08.800
"Loot" rhymes with "coot,"
which takes us to...

07:08.862 --> 07:11.672
this picture of your grandfather.

07:11.732 --> 07:15.373
- "Moola" sounds like "coola."
- Not a word.

07:15.436 --> 07:18.645
Money is in the air-conditioning vent.

07:21.975 --> 07:24.512
This will all be over soon, buddy.
Just give me one last smile.

07:24.578 --> 07:25.921
You too.

07:25.979 --> 07:28.084
Mom's already on her way with the money.
Don't worry.

07:28.148 --> 07:30.094
Oh, my God!
I don't want to go in there.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.096
- You're going in here.
- I don't want to go in here!

07:32.152 --> 07:34.928
Okay. This is where Sophie works.

07:34.988 --> 07:36.490
- She's the one in the hat.
- Copy that.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.594
Tracy works upstairs.
We'll meet in the food court in 30 minutes.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.161
- Sound like a plan?
- A plan.

07:40.227 --> 07:42.537
- Not sure if it's a finger-drumming plan.
- Get in there.

07:42.596 --> 07:45.770
Two of my students,
Tracy and Sophie, B.F.F.'s...

07:45.833 --> 07:48.643
were planning on having
a joint sweet 16 together-

07:48.702 --> 07:51.615
until they got in a fight
over a boy, Rodney.

07:51.672 --> 07:55.882
Now Tracy is planning on having
her own party at the Carriage House.

07:55.943 --> 07:58.981
Our venue, our date. So, our solution-

07:59.046 --> 08:00.889
Talk to them, patch things up...

08:00.948 --> 08:04.020
so that they have their party
together again at the original location.

08:04.084 --> 08:06.792
Friends fighting over a boy-
something we know a thing or two about.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.959
Of course, usually it's gay men,
not teenage girls...

08:09.022 --> 08:12.231
so we will have to adjust
our approach just a- Not at all.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.795
I don't know.

08:14.862 --> 08:17.103
- Mm-mmm.
- Uh, may I help you?

08:17.164 --> 08:19.269
Mmm, yeah, uh, Sophie.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.404
Um, I'm looking
for something for my niece.

08:21.468 --> 08:24.278
She's been really bummed out lately.
Fight with her best friend.

08:24.338 --> 08:27.148
- So I'm just- I'm trying to cheer her up.
- That's so nice.

08:27.207 --> 08:30.586
Yeah. She's always saying to me,
"Uncle Mitch, you're so cool. You're so rad.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.681
I'm so glad I talk to you
about my problems."

08:32.746 --> 08:34.748
You know, I just-
I really get kids that age.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.760
You know, she's- She's almost 16.

08:36.817 --> 08:39.058
I'm almost 16.

08:39.119 --> 08:40.621
Crazy.

08:42.054 --> 08:44.934
Tracy? Tracy McCoy?

08:44.992 --> 08:46.494
Mr. Tucker, hi.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.631
I didn't know
you were old enough to have a job.

08:48.695 --> 08:50.732
I didn't have a job until I was 16.

08:50.797 --> 08:53.073
- Well, I'm almost 16, so-
- Crazy!

08:53.133 --> 08:55.374
- Yeah.
- Oh, my gosh, I remember back then.

08:55.435 --> 08:57.108
My friends and I had so much fun.

08:57.170 --> 09:01.346
Well, when we weren't arguing
about silly things like parties and-

09:06.313 --> 09:10.420
Okay, that's a lot of mirror-looking,
and that's me saying that.

09:10.484 --> 09:12.657
Good, good.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.665
Nice cruising speed.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.826
Oh, look, there's that jogger.
Now we're in the lead.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.166
Can we put the brakes on the sarcasm?

09:19.226 --> 09:21.172
They're worn out.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.936
- Hey, Mom.
- Haley, listen to me.

09:23.997 --> 09:28.036
You did not pay a bunch of parking tickets,
and now your father is in jail.

09:28.101 --> 09:31.048
And I have to go bail him out,
just as soon as I can get my hands...

09:31.104 --> 09:33.015
on a giant pile of cash.

09:34.207 --> 09:36.346
Cash- Ash! Oh!

09:36.410 --> 09:38.117
Oh, God.

09:38.178 --> 09:40.124
Oh! That was furry.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.126
You are in so much trouble.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.685
Oh, don't you think I know that?
What am I gonna do?

09:44.751 --> 09:46.253
You're going to get what you deserve.

09:46.320 --> 09:49.563
A parking violation
is second only to a moving violation...

09:49.623 --> 09:51.569
which is grounds for the loss
of a driving privilege.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.366
Privilege, not a right.

09:53.427 --> 09:56.670
Oh, my God, shut up. This is why Mom
pays me to drive with you.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.539
- What?
- Where do you think she's calling me from?

09:58.599 --> 10:00.237
The Closet and Blinds Union?

10:00.300 --> 10:04.476
Why would closet workers and blind people
even have a union together? Think!

10:05.939 --> 10:07.782
Excuse me, waiter.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.650
Could you please tell me
about the surf and turf?

10:09.710 --> 10:14.216
Mr. Lobster says, "it's terrible!"
While Mr. Cow goes-

10:14.281 --> 10:17.592
"Yeah, I think you should
probably just have the pasta."

10:17.651 --> 10:18.652
Dada.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.926
No, no, no, little man.

10:20.988 --> 10:23.832
That's your dada right there
with the drinky.

10:23.890 --> 10:27.428
- Over-explaining.
- Don't feel bad. He's just making sounds.

10:27.494 --> 10:29.235
He may not even know
what the "D" word means.

10:29.296 --> 10:33.540
I'm fine. He's one. I've watched him
pee into his own face and smile.

10:36.937 --> 10:39.144
Hola, mi amor. I wanted to talk to you.

10:39.206 --> 10:40.708
Uh, what are you doing?

10:40.774 --> 10:43.254
I decided to top
Amy's little "forgotten coat" trick...

10:43.310 --> 10:45.187
with a romantic gesture of my own.

10:45.245 --> 10:48.419
- You see-
- Yes, about Amy-

10:48.482 --> 10:53.056
I know that I don't know her, but she seems
like some of those girls that you have liked...

10:53.120 --> 10:54.724
but they haven't always-

10:54.788 --> 10:56.324
You may not know her, but I do.

10:56.390 --> 10:57.960
I went on her Facebook page...

10:58.025 --> 11:00.699
and I put one of her favorite things
in each of the pockets of her coat.

11:00.761 --> 11:05.073
- So when she reaches inside-
- She'll find a small box of Dutch chocolates.

11:05.132 --> 11:07.908
- Sweet, but-
- Raspberry Rhapsody lip gloss, anyone?

11:07.968 --> 11:10.380
My favorite, but I still wonder-

11:10.437 --> 11:12.644
Hello, Heavenly Soak bath salts.

11:12.706 --> 11:16.586
- What next will she find?
- Only a lily of the valley scented candle.

11:16.643 --> 11:18.281
I love it!

11:18.345 --> 11:21.155
Ay. I wish she had more pockets!

11:22.249 --> 11:27.460
"Bucks" rhymes with "nyuks"-
Three Stooges.

11:27.521 --> 11:28.556
Damn it.

11:28.622 --> 11:34.334
"Wampum," "pom-pom"-
Cheerleading costume.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.965
Come on. Oh, my God, really?

11:37.030 --> 11:42.708
"Bank," "sank"-
novelization of the movie Titanic

11:42.769 --> 11:44.476
Then why do we keep that thing?

11:44.538 --> 11:47.781
Oh, Phil, of course!

11:47.841 --> 11:49.946
Of course, because "dough" rhymes with-

11:50.010 --> 11:51.751
I don't care. I don't care.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.121
Hi, buddy.

11:59.186 --> 12:00.824
Hmm? Ah.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.833
Who am I?

12:02.889 --> 12:04.334
Who am I?

12:04.391 --> 12:05.699
Come on.

12:07.761 --> 12:09.263
He's your dad.

12:09.329 --> 12:12.310
That's right. He's your dad.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.845
Hi, Dad.
Hi, Dad.

12:14.901 --> 12:17.279
You can do it. Come on. Say "Dad."

12:17.337 --> 12:19.283
Come on.

12:19.973 --> 12:21.475
Come on!

12:21.541 --> 12:23.179
Andy!

12:23.243 --> 12:25.484
Hey. How'd it go with Sophie?

12:25.545 --> 12:27.991
I did my best, but I don't think
she's ready to forgive.

12:28.048 --> 12:29.686
- Oh, damn it.
- I know.

12:29.750 --> 12:32.697
- We're screwed.
- Yeah, thanks a lot, Sophie.

12:32.753 --> 12:35.359
Well, Tracy really was out of line.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.129
- Was she?
- Yeah.

12:37.190 --> 12:40.865
- Or was Sophie, per usual, being a big drama queen?
- Drama queen?

12:40.927 --> 12:43.999
No, Tracy was spreading rumors
that Sophie's boyfriend was still into Maya.

12:44.064 --> 12:46.670
They weren't rumors.
She heard it directly from someone...

12:46.733 --> 12:49.646
who saw Maya and Rodney
holding hands at the pier.

12:49.703 --> 12:52.411
Cam, who? Dana!

12:52.472 --> 12:54.543
Yeah, like she could be trusted.

12:54.608 --> 12:56.178
This is Aidan all over again.

12:56.243 --> 12:58.849
Mitchell, it's from Tracy.

12:58.912 --> 13:03.361
"Mr. Tucker, thank you.
Talked to Sophie. Party's back on."

13:03.416 --> 13:04.827
- Are you kidding me?
- Oh, my gosh.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.728
- You're an evil genius!
- You are!

13:06.787 --> 13:09.996
You know what? I give Tracy a lot of credit
for admitting she was wrong. I do.

13:10.056 --> 13:12.593
Yeah, even though it was Sophie's fault.

13:12.659 --> 13:14.297
- No!
- Hmm?

13:14.361 --> 13:16.932
- What?
- They're still using our venue.

13:16.997 --> 13:18.635
No! Are you kidding me?

13:18.698 --> 13:21.235
This is so frustrating.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.974
Really? Are you sure
that's how you feel...

13:23.036 --> 13:25.038
or do you need a little more time
to think about it?

13:25.105 --> 13:26.607
Sounds like you're trying
to make a point there.

13:26.673 --> 13:28.880
Wow, I'm surprised
you picked up on that so quick.

13:28.942 --> 13:31.946
Yeah, you're definitely dancing around something.
I feel like it's speed-related.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.514
Yeah, we lost the Carriage House...

13:33.580 --> 13:36.186
because you, true to form,
couldn't make a timely decision.

13:36.249 --> 13:38.195
We were out of the room for two sec-

13:38.251 --> 13:39.594
What is this "true to form" business?

13:39.653 --> 13:42.099
- 28 Richdale Road.
- Oh, my God. Are you kidding me?

13:42.155 --> 13:44.157
You hemmed and hawed
over our dream house...

13:44.224 --> 13:46.261
and now somebody else
is eating breakfast in our nook.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.636
I needed the weekend.
I never saw myself in a ranch.

13:48.695 --> 13:51.107
And what about Las Vegas,
when you couldn't quite commit to the show?

13:51.164 --> 13:54.043
- No, no, don't.
- No, no. No, it's fine.

13:54.100 --> 13:57.570
We'll see 'em next time,
just as soon as that tiger un-eats Roy.

14:05.912 --> 14:09.121
- I love the sign.
- I'm not sure.

14:09.182 --> 14:12.254
First, I thought just a little accent
of color was all it needed...

14:12.319 --> 14:14.560
but now I'm thinking balloons.

14:14.621 --> 14:17.795
Jay, what do you like better?
The accent or the balloons?

14:17.858 --> 14:20.930
- I've been asking myself that since I met you.
- ¡Ay.!

14:20.994 --> 14:24.840
Can I just say I want this type of
playful banter in my relationship.

14:24.898 --> 14:26.741
Long as you say it someplace else.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.541
Good one.

14:28.602 --> 14:30.479
What are you doing?
They're gonna be here any moment.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.517
I've been combing through
Manny's yearbook.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.415
I found a few girls
he might have a shot with.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.613
Happen to know what Lisa Nagel's like
from the neck down?

14:36.676 --> 14:40.180
- I didn't tell him what you told me to say.
- What? Why?

14:40.247 --> 14:45.287
Because he told me what he's going to do
when Amy comes here, and it's beautiful.

14:45.352 --> 14:47.662
I think he has a better chance
than you think.

14:47.721 --> 14:49.098
He knows how to talk to girls.

14:49.155 --> 14:51.260
He knows how to talk to a girl- you.

14:51.324 --> 14:53.395
I hope you have
a recent picture of his heart.

14:53.460 --> 14:56.805
You're gonna need it, putting the pieces back together.

14:56.863 --> 14:58.501
I'll get it!

14:59.599 --> 15:01.340
- Hey, Mandrake.
- Oh.

15:01.401 --> 15:04.109
Ay. Phil. I heard about jail.
How are you doing?

15:04.170 --> 15:05.979
It was rough.

15:06.039 --> 15:09.213
Stayed in that cold cell a lot longer
than I needed to, thanks to my lovely-

15:09.276 --> 15:13.315
- Your system is ridiculous, Phil.
- Quite simple, actually!

15:13.380 --> 15:15.986
"Cheddah" rhymes with "heada."
Where do you rest your heada? On your pilla!

15:16.049 --> 15:17.119
- Mmm!
- Help me out, buddy.

15:17.183 --> 15:19.925
- I have no buddy.
- But- Luke?

15:19.986 --> 15:21.932
I'll get it!

15:25.091 --> 15:27.230
- Oh.
- Would you please just let it go?

15:27.294 --> 15:30.571
I did let it go immediately. You're the one
who hesitated, like you do with everything.

15:30.630 --> 15:33.406
- Ah.
- The whole way here.

15:33.466 --> 15:35.309
Dad, before you get mad, I'm-

15:35.368 --> 15:40.283
Oh, we passed "before I get mad" hours ago
when I was sitting in solitary for your crime.

15:40.340 --> 15:42.786
It was only solitary
because no one else was in there.

15:42.842 --> 15:44.879
You paid Haley to take me driving?

15:44.945 --> 15:47.050
- Uh-
- That's right. Haley told me everything.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.753
You made up a fake union
just so you wouldn't have to be with me?

15:49.816 --> 15:52.592
Alex, I am so sorry.
Haley, I trusted you.

15:52.652 --> 15:56.065
Good luck trusting anyone
in this family, especially Dad.

15:56.122 --> 15:59.968
Usually when I drag you kicking and screaming
to something, you thank me afterwards.

16:00.026 --> 16:01.528
This time, I was wrong.

16:01.594 --> 16:04.268
- What did he do?
- He lied me into a dance class.

16:04.331 --> 16:06.038
Luke, I am so sorry.

16:06.099 --> 16:09.376
- Haley, you are in so much trouble!
- So much trouble.

16:09.436 --> 16:11.074
Stop trying to make this her fault.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.946
What kind of parents lie to their kids?

16:13.006 --> 16:15.885
- What kind of lesson is that to teach all of us?
- Yeah, seriously, sometimes-

16:15.942 --> 16:18.445
Hey, neither one of you
knows the whole story.

16:18.511 --> 16:21.117
Ah, please. Let me tell them the truth.

16:21.181 --> 16:25.220
Alex, the real reason
Mom doesn't want to teach you to drive...

16:25.285 --> 16:27.231
is because she doesn't want you
getting your license.

16:27.287 --> 16:29.426
- What?
- Think about it.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.197
Mom driving you around
is kind of her favorite time with you.

16:32.258 --> 16:34.636
It's the only place where your nose
isn't buried in a book...

16:34.694 --> 16:36.799
and she can actually talk to you.

16:36.863 --> 16:38.536
Sure, you're getting your license...

16:38.598 --> 16:40.703
but she's losing her little girl.

16:40.767 --> 16:44.715
- Mom, is that true?
- Come here.

16:44.771 --> 16:47.445
And the only reason Dad lied to you is-

16:47.507 --> 16:50.283
Should I tell him, Dad?

16:51.011 --> 16:52.922
Fine.

16:52.979 --> 16:55.220
- Dad was a huge nerd in college.
- Yeah.

16:55.281 --> 16:58.421
He asked Mom out like, 10 times,
and she always said no.

16:58.485 --> 17:02.262
Finally, he said, "I'll never bug you again
if you do one thing."

17:02.322 --> 17:03.824
- Just one.
- "Dance with me."

17:03.890 --> 17:05.926
- Just dance.
- He spun her around on the floor...

17:05.992 --> 17:10.304
and expressed himself with his body
in a way he never could with words.

17:10.363 --> 17:11.865
It was beautiful.

17:11.931 --> 17:14.810
Mom finally saw the Dad
that we all know and love.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.472
And you wanted to give that to me?

17:16.536 --> 17:19.243
Come here. Oh!

17:20.874 --> 17:23.080
Everybody, come for cake!

17:23.143 --> 17:26.750
- We can discuss my punishment later.
- Yeah.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.850
Did she learn that from us?

17:28.915 --> 17:32.294
That can't be taught. it is a gift.

17:32.352 --> 17:34.923
Yeah, she's still doing it,
following me around all moony-eyed.

17:34.988 --> 17:36.524
She just won't get the message.

17:36.589 --> 17:39.536
- But on the bright side, Amy's on her way over.
- We need to talk.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.663
Got to go, Reuben.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.639
- What's up?
- It's about your love life.

17:43.696 --> 17:46.540
- Lot of people here, Jay.
- Consider it an intervention.

17:46.599 --> 17:49.705
Now this whole Amy thing
is going nowhere...

17:49.769 --> 17:52.375
but it sounds like you have
a girl that really likes you.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.180
Now I know it's not everything you want.

17:54.240 --> 17:57.278
Maybe she's a little thick in the middle.
I don't know.

17:57.343 --> 17:58.822
But why don't you give her a try?

17:59.946 --> 18:01.653
So you think
that's the girl I should go for?

18:01.714 --> 18:05.321
She's obviously crazy about you.
What else do you even know about her?

18:05.385 --> 18:07.490
Hi, Manny.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.556
Well, she's six and related to me.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.124
Shall I go on?

18:11.191 --> 18:13.296
Okay, that explains all the outfits
she rejected this morning.

18:13.359 --> 18:16.033
The point remains.
You could lower your sights a little.

18:16.096 --> 18:18.770
- Good, we're still talking about this.
- Ay. leave him alone.

18:18.832 --> 18:23.042
- When Amy comes, she's going to love her coat surprise.
- Who's Amy?

18:23.103 --> 18:25.674
This girl Jay doesn't think is into me,
but she left her coat here.

18:25.738 --> 18:28.878
- Why else would a person do that?
- By that logic, I love Denny's.

18:28.942 --> 18:33.118
Even if she's not into me right away,
isn't it possible she could fall for me over time?

18:33.179 --> 18:34.715
No, there's a thing called chemistry.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.853
- People know right away.
- Not necessarily.

18:37.917 --> 18:40.397
I didn't know immediately
that I liked you.

18:40.453 --> 18:41.761
Well, maybe not the first minute.

18:41.821 --> 18:44.301
- One month.
- A month? Yikes.

18:44.357 --> 18:47.861
I'm with Manny. Some people can trust
their instincts and leap in with both feet.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.873
Others need to take their time.

18:49.929 --> 18:53.240
Okay, what Cam is so subtly implying
is that he knew instantly with me...

18:53.299 --> 18:55.142
while I, as usual, took my sweet time.

18:55.201 --> 18:58.614
Well, guess what.
I knew instantly with you. How about that?

18:58.671 --> 19:02.483
- Actually, I didn't.
- Okay, well, yes, if you count that one disastrous brunch-

19:02.542 --> 19:03.543
- Two months.
- Two months?

19:03.610 --> 19:05.055
- Mm-hmm.
- Yikes!

19:05.111 --> 19:07.955
Well, I'm in the Jay camp.
When you meet the right person, bang!

19:08.014 --> 19:12.087
- That's what happened with- How long?
- Uh, six months?

19:12.152 --> 19:13.756
Six months. Yikes.

19:13.820 --> 19:18.792
- But you were preg-tically engaged to me by then.
- Mmm, nice save, Dad.

19:18.858 --> 19:21.862
Wait a minute. I thought you fell
in love with him after he danced with you.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.908
And that was six months in.

19:23.963 --> 19:26.569
- Why did it take you so long to dance with me, Phil?
- I don't know, Claire.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.806
You'd think I would've gotten to it
by then since we lived together.

19:28.868 --> 19:32.145
I'm sorry. I've been berating you
about dragging your feet...

19:32.205 --> 19:34.811
and when it comes to us,
I'm even more hesitatey than-

19:34.874 --> 19:37.150
No, no, this is great, because that
makes our real anniversary...

19:37.210 --> 19:38.883
two months later,
when we were both sure.

19:38.945 --> 19:41.186
We can still book
the Carriage House for our wedding.

19:41.247 --> 19:42.817
- Oh, my gosh, are you calling them?
- Yes.

19:42.882 --> 19:44.384
- Yes!
- Although, I-I am-

19:44.450 --> 19:45.724
- Call them.
- Okay.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.765
So, you were living
with this guy the whole time-

19:47.820 --> 19:49.322
Oh. Uh-

19:49.389 --> 19:52.461
- Jay!
- Aw, how cute. He wants cake.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.869
No, no, listen, listen, listen!
What's he saying?

19:54.928 --> 19:55.929
Jay.

19:55.995 --> 19:57.975
Jay! He's saying "Jay"!

19:58.031 --> 20:00.170
- Oh.
- He knows me!

20:00.233 --> 20:02.372
And that "Jay" word,
that's harder to say than "Dada."

20:02.435 --> 20:04.574
He's a genius. Come here.

20:06.372 --> 20:09.148
She's here!

20:09.209 --> 20:12.622
- This is it, Manny!
- Go get her, buddy!

20:12.679 --> 20:15.353
Hey, hey, hey. Listen, kid.
You might've been right...

20:15.415 --> 20:18.328
about some people needing
a little more time before they come around.

20:18.384 --> 20:21.160
I mean, look at peanut here.
Good luck, Manny.

20:21.221 --> 20:23.167
Thanks, Jay.

20:24.157 --> 20:26.603
So it took you six months, huh, Phil?

20:26.659 --> 20:29.162
I can do six months.

20:29.229 --> 20:31.334
I'll be here!

20:31.397 --> 20:33.104
- I'm not loving this.
- Mm-mmm.

20:42.942 --> 20:45.650
His door is still closed.
What is he doing in there?

20:45.712 --> 20:47.385
I think we both know
what he's doing in there.

20:47.447 --> 20:50.326
- He's been at it for hours.
- That's how I was at his age.

20:50.383 --> 20:52.624
He's gonna wear himself out.
You should talk to him.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.494
I don't want to embarrass him.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.966
- So knock first.
- Maybe you're right.

20:57.023 --> 20:58.900
I don't want him doing it wrong
and getting hurt.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.835
Luke?

21:00.893 --> 21:02.839
I'm coming in!

21:03.429 --> 21:05.773
Hey, man. Buddy!

21:05.832 --> 21:07.505
Dad? Get out of here!

21:07.567 --> 21:09.638
Don't be embarrassed, son.
It's perfectly natural!

21:09.702 --> 21:11.204
Get out!
