WEBVTT

00:10.320 --> 00:12.117
<i>Man, I love COPS.</i>

00:12.320 --> 00:14.197
Yeah, definitely the best show on FO X.

00:14.400 --> 00:16.470
Yeah, like that's saying much.

00:18.120 --> 00:20.156
The American justice system
at work.

00:20.360 --> 00:23.670
Beating the crap out of people
before judges let them go.

00:27.920 --> 00:30.957
Almost makes me want to pay taxes.

00:31.400 --> 00:33.152
Or vote.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.197
You know, I could have been
a great cop.

00:36.400 --> 00:39.153
Well, with my catlike reflexes
and keen senses.

00:39.360 --> 00:42.193
I got eyes in the back of my head,
you know.

00:42.400 --> 00:47.918
<i>Peg. Peg, could you keep it down?
We're trying to watch TV, here.</i>

00:52.840 --> 00:57.231
Do you believe that show is still
on the air?

01:03.840 --> 01:06.195
It's a classic. I love it.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.631
- Except for the stupid neighbours.
- Yeah.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:47.560 --> 01:51.189
So use Extra extra virgin olive oil.

01:51.560 --> 01:55.439
It's 100 percent pure like me.

01:57.400 --> 01:59.152
Not pure enough. Next.

02:00.520 --> 02:01.794
Are you kidding?

02:02.000 --> 02:04.833
Kelly is the perfect spokesmodel
for your olive oil.

02:05.040 --> 02:06.598
No one is more innocent.

02:06.800 --> 02:10.793
Hey, time out, boys.
My thong is riding up.

02:13.440 --> 02:15.829
It's a chastity thong.

02:16.040 --> 02:19.032
Young man, this is a national
advertising campaign.

02:19.240 --> 02:22.755
Our spokesperson has to be as pure
as the oil itself.

02:25.480 --> 02:28.233
Sister Claire, I assure you,
Kelly is so pure...

02:28.440 --> 02:31.750
...she makes Mother Teresa
look slutty.

02:31.960 --> 02:35.157
I could tell you stories.

02:35.360 --> 02:36.509
Really?

02:37.480 --> 02:41.189
Sister, I hate to play hard ball
with you but-

02:41.400 --> 02:44.597
Sonny, I spend every day
wrestling with Beelzebub.

02:44.800 --> 02:47.109
I think I can take your best shot.

02:47.320 --> 02:50.596
Well, Kelly's got a firm offer
from the Jehovah's Witnesses...

02:50.800 --> 02:52.711
...to be their new watchtower girl.

02:52.920 --> 02:54.069
So, what's it gonna be?

02:54.280 --> 02:55.235
Sold.

02:55.440 --> 02:59.069
I love putting the screws
to those jerks.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.033
Deal?

03:02.760 --> 03:04.990
But she will have to sign
this morals clause.

03:05.200 --> 03:10.832
And remember, I will be watching.
And so will he.

03:13.120 --> 03:15.554
Hey. So did you get me the job?

03:15.760 --> 03:17.159
Is the Pope Catholic?

03:17.360 --> 03:20.875
How should I know?
Hello, I'm not really a nun.

03:23.840 --> 03:26.400
<i>No, but you play one on TV.</i>

03:26.600 --> 03:27.919
- You got the job.
- Oh, my God.

03:28.120 --> 03:31.237
- You got the job.
- We're gonna be rich. Yeah me.

03:31.440 --> 03:34.398
But, unlike your bra, there's a catch.

03:35.360 --> 03:37.794
See, you're gonna have to sign
this morals clause.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.228
You have to be chaste.

03:39.440 --> 03:41.635
Well, do I get a head start?

03:42.760 --> 03:45.433
Kelly, to get a head start,
you have to have a head.

03:45.920 --> 03:48.798
But my point is, until the sister
goes back to the convent...

03:49.000 --> 03:51.434
...you have to act like
you're not interested in men.

03:52.840 --> 03:55.798
This is gonna be
my most challenging role yet.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.595
<i>Except, of course, when I played Dino
in Flintstones in the Park.</i>

03:59.800 --> 04:00.915
Oh, yeah, big stretch.

04:01.120 --> 04:02.951
You jumping a guy
and licking his face...

04:03.160 --> 04:05.037
...as soon as he walks
through the door.

04:05.240 --> 04:09.438
Excuse me. I had to play
a hyperactive dinosaur.

04:09.640 --> 04:13.155
That bitch Pebbles
kept trying to upstage me.

04:14.800 --> 04:16.711
Kelly, can you please try
and concentrate?

04:16.920 --> 04:20.276
If you can do this,
we can make $20,000.

04:20.480 --> 04:22.550
Who needs men?

04:22.760 --> 04:25.354
Except for this one over here.

04:25.560 --> 04:26.913
Hey.

04:27.120 --> 04:29.680
What? You expect me to quit
cold turkey?

04:29.880 --> 04:32.792
I think I'm gonna need a patch
or something.

04:34.240 --> 04:35.468
So let me get this straight.

04:35.680 --> 04:37.830
You were sitting not more than
four feet away...

04:38.040 --> 04:40.110
...while a criminal bound
and gagged your wife?

04:40.320 --> 04:42.390
I feel terrible about it.

04:45.240 --> 04:48.391
He took my lucky bowling shirt.

04:50.120 --> 04:51.872
The one you've never washed?

04:52.080 --> 04:55.072
You sure it didn't just walk off
on its own?

04:55.800 --> 04:58.553
No, I think the shoulders
were a little broader.

04:58.760 --> 05:02.833
The jaw was a little more chiselled,
and there was a dimple.

05:03.040 --> 05:04.598
There, that's him.

05:04.800 --> 05:08.315
So you were robbed by a pirate
who looks like Brad Pitt?

05:09.160 --> 05:11.230
Are you sure this is who we're
looking for?

05:11.440 --> 05:14.716
Well, he's who I'm looking for.

05:15.720 --> 05:19.918
Okay. For your insurance report,
we got you down for a bowling shirt...

05:20.120 --> 05:22.429
...a Maserati and a Picasso.

05:23.320 --> 05:26.471
Make that two Picassos.
Write one down for yourself.

05:28.200 --> 05:29.315
Thanks, buddy.

05:29.520 --> 05:30.669
Hey.

05:30.880 --> 05:32.598
And speaking of objects de art...

05:32.800 --> 05:36.509
...I'll see you at the Jiggly Room
on Saturday.

05:36.960 --> 05:39.554
I can't go. I'm on duty.

05:39.760 --> 05:41.193
What do you mean you can't go?

05:41.400 --> 05:44.597
If you're not there,
we can't do the strip searches.

05:46.480 --> 05:50.234
<i>I know. But that stupid show COPS
is following me around.</i>

05:50.440 --> 05:52.112
<i>COPS?</i>

05:52.320 --> 05:53.833
<i>You're gonna be on COPS?</i>

05:54.040 --> 05:56.315
<i>It's my life's dream to be on COPS.</i>

05:56.520 --> 05:59.114
But, Al, I work alone.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.032
You lose three partners in a week...

06:01.240 --> 06:03.959
...and suddenly nobody wants
to ride with you.

06:04.720 --> 06:08.508
I do. See, every great cop
works with another guy.

06:08.720 --> 06:10.358
<i>Starsky and Hutch, two guys.</i>

06:10.560 --> 06:12.278
<i>Jak e and the Fatman, two guys.</i>

06:12.480 --> 06:14.994
<i>Cagney & Lacey, two guys.</i>

06:20.080 --> 06:21.274
- I don't know.
- Hey, Dan.

06:21.480 --> 06:25.871
Does the captain know you rent
the patrol car out for prom dates?

06:26.080 --> 06:27.832
Pick you up at 8.

06:29.280 --> 06:32.909
How did you develop
such a rich fantasy life?

06:44.280 --> 06:46.032
How do you think?

06:47.920 --> 06:50.559
Gee, thanks for such a fun evening,
sister.

06:50.760 --> 06:53.638
I don't know Apostle Bingo
could be so exciting.

06:53.840 --> 06:55.796
Well, tomorrow night we're going to
play...

06:56.000 --> 06:58.594
...the mother superior's favourite game.

06:58.800 --> 07:01.109
What? Spin the Candle Stick?

07:01.320 --> 07:04.073
No. Messiah Mystery Date.

07:04.280 --> 07:08.956
Will he be a dud,
or will he rise again?

07:14.040 --> 07:16.713
Come on, sister,
I'll drive you back to your hotel.

07:16.920 --> 07:20.310
If you're not home by midnight,
you might turn into a Protestant.

07:21.480 --> 07:26.110
That would never happen.
I am a Bride of Christ.

07:26.320 --> 07:29.756
Wow, that must have been
a fancy wedding.

07:30.880 --> 07:33.952
She's not the brightest bead
on the rosary, is she?

07:38.160 --> 07:39.513
Oh, God.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.392
Thank God.

07:45.200 --> 07:48.397
- Oh, hi, sweetie.
- Hi, Mom.

07:48.600 --> 07:49.953
Hey, is something wrong?

07:51.240 --> 07:52.912
Well, you wanna talk about it?

07:54.000 --> 07:56.878
Oh, come on. Let's have
a little mother-daughter moment...

07:57.080 --> 07:59.435
<i>...just like they do on TV.</i>

07:59.840 --> 08:01.034
Thanks, Mom.

08:01.240 --> 08:03.151
It's really personal...

08:03.360 --> 08:04.839
...and it's kind of embarrassing.

08:05.040 --> 08:08.237
Oh, honey, you got your period.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.310
Mom, I'm 25.

08:12.520 --> 08:15.876
Well, don't be ashamed.
Every woman develops differently.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.230
You're just a late bloomer.

08:18.440 --> 08:20.237
Mom, it's not my period.

08:20.760 --> 08:23.433
Well, don't worry. It'll come.
I'm glad we had this talk.

08:23.640 --> 08:26.791
No, no, Mom. Wait, that's not it.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.592
Well, don't tell me you're pregnant.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.233
What would the neighbours think?

08:30.440 --> 08:33.078
Me, a grandmother at 35.

08:34.720 --> 08:37.359
Mars to Mom. I am not pregnant.

08:37.559 --> 08:39.994
Well, honey, then what is it?

08:40.200 --> 08:41.394
Bulimia?

08:41.600 --> 08:43.477
Anorexia?

08:43.679 --> 08:46.148
You found out about Santa Clause?

08:46.920 --> 08:48.831
What about Santa?

08:49.600 --> 08:51.192
Oh, nothing.

08:51.880 --> 08:53.074
Okay.

08:53.280 --> 08:55.430
It's about not having sex.

08:55.640 --> 08:58.677
Oh, my God, you got married.

09:02.360 --> 09:03.713
No, Mom.

09:03.920 --> 09:06.150
It's just that I'm having
a really hard time...

09:06.360 --> 09:08.510
...with that morals clause
I told you about.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.790
I miss boys.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.115
Well...

09:12.320 --> 09:15.437
...you know what Grandma Wanker
always said.

09:16.920 --> 09:18.911
Pass the gravy?

09:20.000 --> 09:21.228
No.

09:21.760 --> 09:23.910
You gonna eat that skin?

09:24.800 --> 09:25.755
No.

09:25.960 --> 09:30.033
But, actually, what's she's talking about
is chocolate.

09:30.240 --> 09:33.471
That's right. Whenever you feel
the urge, you just take two of these...

09:33.680 --> 09:36.274
<i>...and call QVC in the morning.</i>

09:36.480 --> 09:39.119
Thanks, Mom, but I think it's gonna be
a long time...

09:39.320 --> 09:41.959
...before I become that desperate.

09:46.760 --> 09:49.228
These bonbons are great.

09:49.680 --> 09:53.559
But you know, I can't get my leg
to stop twitching.

09:54.080 --> 09:55.672
Oh, you get used to that.

09:56.520 --> 09:57.714
Freeze, bitches.

10:02.680 --> 10:05.990
I haven't thought about men once,
I swear.

10:06.440 --> 10:11.070
Damn. I always get this place confused
with the crack house.

10:22.240 --> 10:25.118
Oh, baby.

10:25.320 --> 10:28.949
Is that a night stick
or are you just happy to see me?

10:30.280 --> 10:33.989
It's a night stick, Peg,
and I'm not afraid to use it.

10:35.480 --> 10:38.517
Al, I thought we agreed
you weren't gonna carry a gun.

10:38.720 --> 10:41.712
Well, don't worry,
I know how to handle this thing.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.994
That's what he said
on our honeymoon.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.395
Let's ride.

10:56.360 --> 10:57.509
This is great.

10:58.720 --> 11:01.314
Car 54, where are you?

11:01.520 --> 11:04.398
Al, we're car 54.

11:05.320 --> 11:07.231
<i>Hi. I'm Mike from COPS.
Nice to meet you.</i>

11:07.440 --> 11:10.591
Just act natural
and pretend I'm not here.

11:18.400 --> 11:19.719
So why did you become a cop?

11:19.920 --> 11:22.832
It's in the blood.

11:23.040 --> 11:26.316
My pop was a cop.
Top cop just like his pop.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.112
Grandpop. Both top cops.

11:29.320 --> 11:31.231
Make me stop.

11:32.760 --> 11:35.228
As a cop, you're a flop.

11:36.440 --> 11:39.159
So when did your partner
get shot in the head?

11:39.960 --> 11:42.428
In about 30 seconds.

11:42.640 --> 11:46.349
Just like all good cops we start
every shift with an equipment check.

11:46.560 --> 11:49.916
Right. First, we check
to see if the safety's on.

11:52.800 --> 11:54.438
It's not.

11:58.440 --> 12:01.477
Sometimes
we have to make an example.

12:01.680 --> 12:02.635
To who?

12:02.840 --> 12:06.150
The remaining two spotted owls
in this hemisphere?

12:06.360 --> 12:08.954
It's kill or be killed.

12:09.760 --> 12:11.159
Let's ride.

12:14.600 --> 12:17.398
- Hey, Kel, how's it going?
- It's going great.

12:17.600 --> 12:20.273
I haven't thought about men once.

12:26.600 --> 12:28.158
You know, Mom was a big help.

12:28.360 --> 12:31.033
She said all I have to do
is just channel my frustrations...

12:31.240 --> 12:32.958
...into arts and crafts.

12:33.160 --> 12:34.832
Finished.

12:37.040 --> 12:40.635
<i>I call it Death of a Shoe Salesman.</i>

12:42.240 --> 12:44.629
You're doing great, Kelly.
I really am proud of you.

12:44.840 --> 12:45.795
Thanks, Bud.

12:46.520 --> 12:49.159
Hey, you been working out?

13:00.160 --> 13:01.878
Thank God.

13:04.800 --> 13:05.869
Sister Claire.

13:06.080 --> 13:08.833
I just dropped you off at the hotel.
What are you doing here?

13:09.040 --> 13:13.158
I was sitting in my hotel room
when I had a haunting vision of sin.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.590
You shouldn't have ordered
pay-per-view.

13:17.080 --> 13:20.868
I mean, I thought there might be
sinning going on here.

13:21.080 --> 13:23.469
Oh, what could make you
think such a thing?

13:23.680 --> 13:28.879
Oh, we make these
by the thousands at the convent.

13:29.160 --> 13:31.310
- May I?
- Oh, of course.

13:31.520 --> 13:34.557
The Pope has one
of my space needles.

13:36.200 --> 13:38.077
Excuse me, sister,
the meter's running.

13:38.280 --> 13:39.599
Do you want me to go or stay?

13:39.800 --> 13:41.472
- Stay.
- Go.

13:41.680 --> 13:43.716
Hi. I'm Kelly.

13:43.920 --> 13:45.478
And I'm off-duty.

13:45.680 --> 13:48.148
Please, this commercial
could mean national exposure.

13:48.360 --> 13:50.476
Oh, this is all the exposure I want.

13:50.840 --> 13:53.308
Oh, my God.

13:54.760 --> 13:56.159
Oh, no.

13:56.360 --> 13:58.999
Look, I made Stonehenge.

13:59.600 --> 14:04.549
Dear Lord, I thank thee for my talents,
which are considerable.

14:06.920 --> 14:08.672
And Lord...

14:09.200 --> 14:10.952
...bless these good, decent Bundys.

14:11.160 --> 14:14.994
Lead them not into temptation
and deliver them from evil. Amen.

14:19.560 --> 14:21.232
Sinners.

14:21.800 --> 14:23.518
No, sister, this isn't what you think.

14:23.720 --> 14:26.280
Hey, Bud, get your hands off of him.
I saw him first.

14:26.480 --> 14:28.869
Lady, you are fired.

14:29.080 --> 14:32.550
Wait, sister, sister.
She's not my only client.

14:32.760 --> 14:34.751
Can you act?
And will you wear a dress?

14:34.960 --> 14:37.235
No and yes.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.117
I've seen more action
in a shoe store.

14:44.560 --> 14:46.312
Not- Not-
Not that I work there.

14:46.520 --> 14:49.080
No, I mean, I'm a cop
and a damn good one.

14:49.280 --> 14:53.671
<i>Attention patrol car 54,
there's a 6-3-3 in progress.</i>

14:53.880 --> 14:55.279
Finally.

14:55.480 --> 14:58.631
We're on it. Floor it, Danno.

14:58.840 --> 15:00.717
Wait. Wait. Wait.

15:00.920 --> 15:03.309
Let's be careful out there.

15:06.240 --> 15:09.630
Help. Help. Someone help.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.472
Help.

15:18.120 --> 15:20.680
Ma'am, what seems to be
the problem?

15:20.880 --> 15:23.440
It's my Stanley. He's going to jump.

15:23.640 --> 15:27.792
We've got a jumper.
Everybody stay calm.

15:29.160 --> 15:31.594
Is your husband depressed?

15:31.800 --> 15:34.314
I'll say. He's dead.

15:35.160 --> 15:37.879
We've got a dead man up a tree.

15:38.080 --> 15:40.469
No. Stanley's my cat.

15:40.680 --> 15:42.511
A- A cat?

15:42.720 --> 15:45.393
I became a cop to rescue cats?

15:45.600 --> 15:47.670
Be careful. He's very high-strung.

15:47.880 --> 15:50.838
Ma'am, just step aside.
Let me handle this.

15:52.480 --> 15:53.674
Call for backup.

15:56.320 --> 15:57.833
Officer down. Call 911.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.792
Officer down. Officer down.

16:00.000 --> 16:04.312
Quit, Stanley.
Stop playing with that, it's dirty.

16:05.600 --> 16:06.749
Don't pull.

16:06.960 --> 16:08.757
Don't pull.

16:13.920 --> 16:17.629
Man, how many doughnuts
can your partner eat?

16:19.000 --> 16:21.070
I think he's near his record.

16:21.280 --> 16:25.239
You can tell because the buttons
on his shirt are just about to pop.

16:25.440 --> 16:27.476
You might wanna take cover.

16:30.400 --> 16:34.359
Man, talk about the ugly underbelly
of society.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.195
All right, that's it. I'm out of here.

16:37.400 --> 16:40.790
<i>I haven't been on a shoot this lame
since COPS in Amish Country.</i>

16:41.960 --> 16:43.951
<i>You mean, I'm not gonna be
on COPS?</i>

16:44.160 --> 16:46.037
Any available unit.
Burglary in progress...

16:46.240 --> 16:48.196
...at 9766 Jeopardy Lane.

16:49.320 --> 16:50.389
Hey, that's my neighbour.

16:50.600 --> 16:52.955
That must be that punk
who stole my bowling shirt.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.831
Aren't you gonna wait for your partner?

16:57.040 --> 16:59.395
If you were in trouble,
would you want me to wait for him?

16:59.600 --> 17:01.955
You, specifically? Yeah.

17:02.960 --> 17:07.829
Strap yourself in, camera boy.
We're going for a ride.

17:33.320 --> 17:36.596
<i>Hi. This is Jefferson.</i>

17:36.800 --> 17:37.869
<i>And Marcy.</i>

17:41.520 --> 17:44.751
Officer? Officer?

17:45.600 --> 17:47.272
Don't shoot.

17:47.480 --> 17:49.630
We just saw the burglar
right next door.

17:49.840 --> 17:53.150
You mean he tied you up and
smeared you with marshmallow fluff?

17:53.360 --> 17:55.112
Oh, that is sick.

17:55.320 --> 17:56.799
Yeah.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.509
The pervert.

18:04.520 --> 18:05.555
Al...

18:05.760 --> 18:08.638
...is that you?
Why are you dressed-?

18:14.520 --> 18:17.478
She was hysterical.
Clearly needed to be subdued.

18:17.680 --> 18:21.434
<i>Yeah, whatever you say, chief.
This is gonna look great on COPS.</i>

18:21.640 --> 18:26.509
<i>Wait a minute. You mean, I'm gonna be
on TV all covered in fluff?</i>

18:29.560 --> 18:31.915
Our work here is done.

18:32.120 --> 18:34.475
Let's go get that punk.

18:40.360 --> 18:45.832
Hey. Extra extra virgin olive oil
now available virgin-free.

18:46.040 --> 18:48.713
Take some home tonight.

18:48.920 --> 18:51.593
This is Sodom and Gomorrah.

18:52.040 --> 18:54.838
And I am not hiring
any of your harlot clients.

18:55.440 --> 18:56.919
Hey.

18:57.120 --> 19:00.032
Hey, Tina Yothers is not a harlot.

19:00.920 --> 19:03.798
<i>She was the best thing
on Family Ties.</i>

19:04.000 --> 19:06.594
I preferred Skippy.

19:07.920 --> 19:11.117
Young man, I insist you take me
back to my hotel.

19:11.320 --> 19:14.392
Thanks, but you're not my type.

19:14.600 --> 19:17.273
Caught you, you dirt bag.

19:18.040 --> 19:21.589
Give me back my bowling shirt.

19:21.800 --> 19:24.519
Mike, you getting this?
This is my good side.

19:24.720 --> 19:27.314
Are you kidding? Nuns in an orgy.

19:27.520 --> 19:30.830
<i>Do you have any idea
what Hard Copy will pay for this?</i>

19:32.760 --> 19:35.069
There he is, officer. Arrest him.

19:35.280 --> 19:38.670
- Yeah, book him.
- No, not him. Him.

19:38.880 --> 19:41.792
He destroyed my home,
he shot my cuckoo...

19:42.000 --> 19:43.638
...and he's not even a real cop.

19:43.840 --> 19:45.273
Or a real father.

19:45.480 --> 19:46.833
Or much of a host.

19:47.040 --> 19:48.439
Or very photogenic.

19:48.640 --> 19:51.757
Doesn't it mean anything that
I apprehended this vicious criminal?

19:51.960 --> 19:55.999
Yeah. It means, that you're going
away for impersonating an officer.

19:59.560 --> 20:03.155
- I hope you fry.
- Back at you.

20:06.560 --> 20:09.233
- Officer, can I have a ride?
- Wait, wait, sister.

20:09.440 --> 20:11.431
I just thought
of the most brilliant idea.

20:11.640 --> 20:13.790
I have the perfect client
for your olive oil.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.072
- That's what you said before.
- No. This time, I'm telling the truth.

20:17.280 --> 20:19.475
I mean, she's beautiful,
her schedule is open.

20:19.680 --> 20:22.990
And I promise you complete
and total abstinence.

20:23.560 --> 20:27.599
So use Extra extra virgin olive oil.

20:27.800 --> 20:31.952
It's 100 percent pure. Like me.

20:33.040 --> 20:34.837
I can't believe it. You were right.

20:35.040 --> 20:37.031
She is perfect.

20:37.240 --> 20:38.229
So the deal's still on?

20:38.440 --> 20:40.078
Absolutely.

20:43.640 --> 20:45.596
Next.

20:46.280 --> 20:47.269
Ma.

21:01.280 --> 21:03.157
What kind of agent are you?

21:03.360 --> 21:06.397
That commercial was perfect for me
and you sent in your mother?

21:08.000 --> 21:10.673
Tina, baby, I got bigger plans for you.

21:10.880 --> 21:13.030
Right, like that last great job
you got me...

21:13.240 --> 21:16.277
<i>...playing Pebbles
in Flintstones in the Park?</i>

21:17.640 --> 21:19.835
Well, you said you wanted to return
to the stage?

21:20.040 --> 21:22.713
That was a lame gig.
It rained all week.

21:22.920 --> 21:26.469
And that bitch Dino
kept trying to upstage me.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.314
I've had it with you. You're fired.

21:32.080 --> 21:34.753
Tina, I thought
you were happy with me?

21:35.840 --> 21:38.991
Bud, I'm sure this isn't the first time
you've heard this.

21:39.200 --> 21:41.077
I faked it.
