09:06.680 --> 09:08.716
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
SHE'S MORE THAN COOL.

09:08.820 --> 09:09.980
IT'S JUST I TOLD HER

09:10.100 --> 09:11.544
I WOULD HAVE BREAKFAST

09:15.450 --> 09:16.166
IT'S FINE.

09:16.270 --> 09:17.828

09:17.930 --> 09:19.136
I'M GONNA DO IT
A DIFFERENT DAY, OKAY?

09:19.240 --> 09:20.309
I'LL BE BACK. JUST STAY HERE.
[knock on door]

09:20.420 --> 09:21.375
- OKAY.

- HEY, HANG ON, MOM.

09:23.140 --> 09:23.890
HI.

09:24.010 --> 09:25.728

09:25.840 --> 09:27.831
- YES. I KNOW. IT'S--
- GONNA BE A PROBLEM.

09:27.940 --> 09:29.999
- WELL, I-I CAN'T G0.
I CAN'T GO TODAY.

09:30.120 --> 09:31.496
- I HAVE BEEN WAITING ALL WEEK
FOR PANCAKES.

09:31.600 --> 09:32.635
- I AM SORRY.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.048
- THE LINE AT HUCK'S
IS GETTING LONG,

09:34.150 --> 09:35.390
AND I WANT PANCAKES.
- MOM, I CANNOT GO TODAY. OKAY?

09:35.500 --> 09:36.080

09:36.190 --> 09:36.804

PLEASE BE QUIET.

09:40.780 --> 09:41.576

09:41.680 --> 09:43.409
- MOM, NOTHING. JUST STOP.

09:43.510 --> 09:44.408
- IF YOU'RE GONNA CANCEL
BREAKFAST,

09:44.510 --> 09:45.579
YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME FACTS.

09:45.680 --> 09:46.669
YOU ROBBED ME
OF MY BREAKFAST TIME.

09:46.790 --> 09:47.859
- I'VE BEEN KIND OF,
LIKE, SEEING HIM.

09:47.960 --> 09:50.133
- REALLY?

09:50.240 --> 09:52.822
I REALLY LIKE THIS GUY.

09:56.310 --> 09:57.720
- I CAN'T TALK ABOUT THIS NOW.
HE'S INSIDE.

09:57.830 --> 09:58.933
- TALK ABOUT IT.
YOU GIVE ME SOME FACTS.

09:59.040 --> 10:00.007

10:00.110 --> 10:02.032

10:04.010 --> 10:05.568
THAT'S ENOUGH.
ISN'T THAT ENOUGH?

10:05.670 --> 10:07.729
- WHO?
- AT A BASEBALL GAME.

10:07.840 --> 10:09.660
- [gasps] THE ARMY GUY?
- SHH!

10:09.780 --> 10:11.224

10:11.330 --> 10:12.740

10:19.820 --> 10:21.367
PLEASE GET OUT HERE.
GOOD-BYE.

10:21.480 --> 10:22.299
I LOVE YOU.

10:22.410 --> 10:24.378

10:31.110 --> 10:34.318
[both laughing]

10:34.420 --> 10:36.285
_ UH--

10:36.390 --> 10:38.119
- YOU STOLE MY SHIRT

10:45.610 --> 10:47.601
- HEY, CROSBY.

10:47.710 --> 10:49.120
CROSBY!

10:49.230 --> 10:50.151
HEY!

10:53.370 --> 10:54.576
HEY.

10:54.680 --> 10:56.238
- HEY.
- WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?

10:56.340 --> 10:57.819
I'M GONE FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.
THE PLACE IS A DISASTER AREA.

10:57.930 --> 11:00.069
- GOOD MORNING TO YOU TOO.

11:00.170 --> 11:01.728
- WHAT, IS THIS A JOKE?
WHAT HAPPENED?

11:01.830 --> 11:03.718
- THE DAVE RAY TRIO HAPPENED.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.058
THOSE JAZZ NERDS,
THEY KNOW HOW TO PARTY, MAN.

11:05.180 --> 11:07.136
THEY TURNED INTO GREMLINS
LAST NIGHT.

11:07.250 --> 11:08.581
- WHERE'S AMBER?
- AMBER TEXTED ME.

11:08.700 --> 11:09.928
SHE OVERSLEPT.

11:10.040 --> 11:11.359
I TOLD HER JUST
TO SHOW UP AT LUNCH.

11:11.460 --> 11:12.734
AND IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.319
- OH, IT'S FINE FOR HER
TO COME IN LATE IN THE DAY

11:14.430 --> 11:15.385
AND THEN JUST GONNA SIT HERE.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.183
- IT'S FINE.
- CROSBY, THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE!

11:17.290 --> 11:19.804
YOU CAN'T LET HER SKATE BY
'CAUSE SHE'S A FAMILY MEMBER.

11:19.920 --> 11:21.296
- OKAY. I'M SORRY.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:21.400 --> 11:22.628
- I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.
- I WANT YOU TO COME DOWN HERE.

11:22.750 --> 11:23.603
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:23.710 --> 11:24.847
CLEAN THIS.
LOOK AT THAT.

11:24.960 --> 11:27.645
THAT'S REAL NICE, ISN'T IT?

11:27.750 --> 11:29.570
TELL YOU WHAT.
YOU CLEAN IT UP.

11:29.680 --> 11:31.432
- I WILL CLEAN IT UP.
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT?

11:31.550 --> 11:32.949
- I WILL.

11:33.070 --> 11:33.923
[clattering,
glass breaking]

11:34.030 --> 11:38.990
LEAVE IT.
I'LL GET THAT TOO.

11:44.040 --> 11:46.861
- CAMILLE, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO ALL OF THAT.

11:46.980 --> 11:48.698
YOU CAN LEAVE IT.
- OH, THAT'S OKAY.

11:48.810 --> 11:50.118
I DON'T MIND.
I MEAN, I'M HERE TO HELP.

11:50.220 --> 11:53.109
- I KNOW, BUT IT'S ACTUALLY
MAX'S JOB.

11:53.220 --> 11:54.152
- OH.

11:54.260 --> 11:56.296
- HE--WE'RE ON
A WHOLE STICKER SYSTEM

11:56.400 --> 11:58.914
SO IT SORT OF GIVES HIM
INCENTIVE TO DO--

11:59.020 --> 11:59.918
- OF COURSE.
- YOU KNOW.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.055
- YEAH.
- BUT THANKS.

12:01.160 --> 12:02.263
- OKAY.
SO CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING?

12:02.370 --> 12:04.509
- HOW ABOUT A BIG JUG OF WINE?
[laughter]

12:04.620 --> 12:05.996
SHOULD HIT THE SPOT
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.328
- YEAH, YOU WISH.
- I KNOW.

12:07.450 --> 12:09.202
IT'S JUST SORT OF IRONIC
I CAN'T HAVE ANY ALCOHOL

12:09.310 --> 12:10.823
CONSIDERING I'M ABOUT
TO PUMP POISON INTO MY BODY

12:10.930 --> 12:13.819
IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.

12:13.940 --> 12:15.419
- YOU KNOW,
I HAVE A FRIEND

12:15.520 --> 12:18.409
WHO RECENTLY WENT THROUGH CHEMO.
- OH, YEAH? HOW ARE THEY DOING?

12:18.530 --> 12:20.179
- SHE'S DOING GREAT.
- REALLY?

12:20.290 --> 12:22.429
- 18 MONTHS NOW, CANCER-FREE.
- THAT'S GREAT.

12:22.530 --> 12:23.622
- SO BUT ANYWAY,
SHE SAID THAT

12:23.740 --> 12:26.777
IT'S BEST NOT TO THINK OF IT
AS POISON

12:26.880 --> 12:30.327
BUT MORE LIKE
A PLATOON OF SOLDIERS

12:30.430 --> 12:31.533
THAT HAVE ENTERED
YOUR BLOOD STREAM TO--

12:31.640 --> 12:34.985
both: FIGHT THE ENEMY...
- DISEASE.

12:35.090 --> 12:37.229
- I'VE READ ALL THE PAMPHLETS.

12:41.480 --> 12:42.754
- I HATE THIS.

12:42.860 --> 12:44.748
THE WHOLE REASON I GOT HIM
INVOLVED IN BASEBALL

12:44.860 --> 12:45.895
WAS SO HE COULD MAKE
SOME FRIENDS.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.615
- I KNOW.
- HOW COULD THEY NOT INVITE HIM?

12:47.730 --> 12:50.198
- HE'S NEW.
KIDS HAVE GROUPS, CLIQUES.

12:50.320 --> 12:51.764
I'M SURE HE'LL, YOU KNOW,
INVITED SOON.

12:51.870 --> 12:54.145
- YOU DON'T THINK
IT'S BECAUSE HE'S--

12:54.250 --> 12:56.286
- HE'S WHAT?
- BE-BECAUSE--

12:56.390 --> 12:57.618
- BECAUSE HE'S LATINO?
- YES, BECAUSE--

12:57.740 --> 12:59.116
I DON'T KNOW,
BECAUSE KIDS ARE WEIRD.

13:01.950 --> 13:05.568
WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
TO INVITE HIM.

13:11.130 --> 13:11.676
- WHAT?
- NOTHING.

13:11.790 --> 13:13.951
- HEY, BUD.

13:14.060 --> 13:15.789
YOUR MOM AND I WERE
JUST TALKING THAT YOU KNOW,

13:15.890 --> 13:17.755
YOU HAVEN'T HAD ANYBODY OVER
TO THE HOUSE YET.

13:17.860 --> 13:20.340
YOU THINK MAYBE YOU MIGHT
WANT TO, YOU KNOW,

13:20.450 --> 13:21.860
HAVE A BUDDY OVER
FOR A PLAYDATE OR--

13:21.970 --> 13:24.245
- PLAYDATE? ISN'T THAT
FOR, LIKE, FOR LITTLE KIDS?

13:24.350 --> 13:25.510
- OH, YEAH. NO.
- OH, YEAH, NO. IT IS.

13:25.630 --> 13:26.699
SO NOT A PLAYDATE.
A HANG-OUT.

13:26.800 --> 13:27.789
- HANG-OUT.
- YEAH.

13:27.910 --> 13:29.719
WOULD YOU BE INTO THAT?
- SURE.

13:29.840 --> 13:32.240
- GREAT.
- COOL.

13:32.360 --> 13:34.180
- WHO SHOULD WE INVITE?
- MAYBE MIGUEL.

13:34.290 --> 13:35.427
- OKAY.
- I DON'T KNOW MIGUEL.

13:35.530 --> 13:37.942
WHICH ONE'S--
- IS HE ON THE BASEBALL TEAM?

13:38.050 --> 13:41.019
- NO, HE USED TO LIVE
IN THE APARTMENT ABOVE MINE.

13:41.130 --> 13:42.119
- OH, YOU--
[groans]

13:42.230 --> 13:44.437
YOU MEAN IN
THE OLD NEIGHBORHOOD.

13:44.540 --> 13:46.189
- YEAH.
HE'S COOL.

13:46.300 --> 13:48.712
- YEAH, WELL,
WE'LL LOOK INTO IT.

13:48.820 --> 13:49.263
- GREAT.

13:54.590 --> 13:57.411
- CAN WE DO THAT?

13:59.180 --> 14:04.140
- WELL, THESE ARE JOB PROSPECTS
COURTESY OF THE V.A.

14:04.250 --> 14:05.046
HERE YOU GO.

14:05.150 --> 14:06.242
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:06.360 --> 14:08.385
YOU COULD PUT IN
AN APPLICATION IN HERE.

14:08.500 --> 14:09.831
AMBER USED TO WORK HERE.
SHE LIKED IT.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.633
SHE'LL PUT IN
A GOOD WORD FOR YOU.

14:11.740 --> 14:12.729
- YOU'RE REALLY INVESTED

14:12.850 --> 14:14.772
IN MY EMPLOYMENT SITUATION,
I SEE.

14:14.880 --> 14:16.017
- YEAH, I MEAN, IT'S--

14:16.130 --> 14:17.438
IT'S JUST GREAT TO HAVE
SOMEWHERE TO GO

14:17.540 --> 14:20.191
IN THE MORNING
OR A REASON TO GET UP.

14:20.300 --> 14:22.473
JUST MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER
ABOUT YOURSELF.

14:22.580 --> 14:24.127
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW.

14:24.240 --> 14:26.026
- OKAY, I'LL--
I'LL TAKE A LOOK.

14:26.140 --> 14:27.164
SPRINKLER TECHNICIAN,

14:27.280 --> 14:29.032
BERLIN-MIRO
LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE.

14:29.140 --> 14:30.209
STARTING SALARY--

14:30.310 --> 14:33.063
WOW, THAT'S LOW.

14:33.180 --> 14:34.693
- YEAH, WELL, OKAY.
THAT'S NOT A GOOD ONE THERE.

14:34.800 --> 14:36.028
BUT CHECK OUT THE OTHER ONES.

14:36.150 --> 14:38.903
- UH, NORELL FAMILY FARMS,
IRRIGATION CONSULTANT

14:39.010 --> 14:41.808
FOR MID-SIZED WHEAT FARM.

14:41.910 --> 14:43.116
- WHEAT.

14:43.220 --> 14:44.255
KID FROM WYOMING...

14:44.360 --> 14:48.228
MUST KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT WHEAT.

14:48.330 --> 14:49.911
- YEAH, I DO KNOW
A LITTLE SOMETHING

14:50.020 --> 14:51.499
ABOUT PLANTING WHEAT,
BUT NOT FROM WYOMING.

14:51.610 --> 14:52.838
- YEAH, WHERE?

14:52.960 --> 14:54.916
- WELL, ONE OF MY JOBS
IN AFGHANISTAN

14:55.030 --> 14:56.292
WAS TO TALK
TO THE LOCAL FARMERS THERE.

14:56.410 --> 14:59.026
WE'D OFFER THEM SEEDS,
FERTILIZER, BETTER IRRIGATION.

14:59.130 --> 15:00.927
TRY TO GAIN THEIR TRUST,
YOU KNOW.

15:01.030 --> 15:02.201
WIN THE HEARTS AND MINDS.

15:02.310 --> 15:05.609
AND THEN, YOU KNOW,
WE WANTED THEM EVENTUALLY

15:05.730 --> 15:07.869
TO SWITCH OUT THEIR OPIUM PLANTS
FOR WHEAT CROPS.

15:07.970 --> 15:09.699
- MM-HMM.
HOW'D IT WORK OUT?

15:09.800 --> 15:12.451
- IT DIDN'T ALWAYS WORK OUT
SO GOOD.

15:13.940 --> 15:17.319
- WHAT HAPPENED?

15:17.430 --> 15:21.014
- WE MET THIS ONE OPIUM FARMER
OUTSIDE OF MARJAH,

15:21.120 --> 15:24.180
AND WE WORKED ON THIS GUY
FOR A WHILE.

15:24.300 --> 15:27.087
AND THEN FINALLY HE AGREED
TO PLANT THE WHEAT.

15:27.200 --> 15:29.054
A COUPLE OF WEEKS
AFTER WE HELPED HIM

15:29.160 --> 15:33.438
SWITCH OUT THE POPPY PLANTS,

15:33.550 --> 15:36.439
HE WAS KILLED.

15:38.100 --> 15:40.512
UH, I GUESS THEY WERE SENDING

15:40.620 --> 15:44.249
A MESSAGE TO THE REST
OF THE FARMERS.

15:44.350 --> 15:47.035
- OH.
THAT'S TOUGH.

15:47.150 --> 15:49.357
- WE KILLED THAT GUY, ZEEK.

15:49.460 --> 15:51.906
WE DIDN'T DROP ANY BOMBS
OR PULL ANY TRIGGER,

15:52.020 --> 15:55.945
BUT WE KILLED THAT GUY.

16:08.100 --> 16:09.715
- I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS.

16:09.830 --> 16:12.469
TRY AGAIN UP HERE.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.346
- CAN I GET SOMETHING FOR YOU?

16:18.320 --> 16:19.799
- IT'S UP HERE.
- OH. [laughs]

16:19.900 --> 16:21.481
- IT PROBABLY...
- I MOVED IT. I'M SORRY.

16:21.600 --> 16:24.114
YOU KNOW, I FIGURED
WITH YOUR STITCHES,

16:24.220 --> 16:25.664
YOU KNOW, YOU WOULDN'T
BE ABLE TO REACH.

16:25.770 --> 16:26.668
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH, CAMILLE.

16:26.770 --> 16:27.805
THAT'S GREAT.
- SURE.

16:27.910 --> 16:30.151
AND I'LL GET THE WATER.
- THANK YOU.

16:30.260 --> 16:31.773
[stove clicks]
OKAY.

16:31.880 --> 16:34.940
- IS THAT SUGAR?

16:35.060 --> 16:36.812
- YEAH.
- DON'T YOU HAVE ANY STEVIA?

16:36.920 --> 16:39.502
- I DON'T HAVE STEVIA HERE.
I DON'T USUALLY USE IT.

16:39.610 --> 16:41.020
- WELL, IT'S ACTUALLY GOOD
FOR YOU.

16:41.130 --> 16:42.336
[doorbell rings]
STEVIA, IT'S A NUTRIENT.

16:42.440 --> 16:44.579
- IT'S ONLY ONE SCOOP.
OKAY.

16:44.690 --> 16:46.476
- IS THAT YOUR DOOR?
- YOU'RE RIGHT. THAT'S MY DOOR.

16:46.590 --> 16:47.659
I'LL GET IT.
- OKAY--NO, NO, NO.

16:47.760 --> 16:49.034
I'VE GOT IT.
I'VE GOT IT.

16:49.140 --> 16:50.175

16:50.280 --> 16:52.202
- OH, HI.

16:52.320 --> 16:53.412

OR SOMETHING?

18:16.160 --> 18:17.536
YOU GUYS WANT ANYTHING TO EAT?

18:17.640 --> 18:19.369

18:19.470 --> 18:20.505

WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A SEAT?

18:20.610 --> 18:22.259

TO THE SOCIAL WORKER.

18:27.830 --> 18:29.138
- AND?

18:29.240 --> 18:30.207
- AND SHE DOESN'T THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.198
SHE THINKS WE SHOULD
KEEP WORKING ON

18:32.310 --> 18:33.208
ESTABLISHING HIM HERE.

18:33.310 --> 18:35.790
NOT OPEN UP OLD WOUNDS.

18:35.900 --> 18:40.769

SO NO MIGUEL.

18:40.870 --> 18:42.622
- NO.

18:42.740 --> 18:43.900

ANYWAY.

18:44.010 --> 18:45.284
I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE
REALLY GOOD.

18:45.400 --> 18:47.539
- HONEY, THE SOCIAL WORKER
SAID IT'S A BAD IDEA.

18:47.640 --> 18:48.732
- SHE DIDN'T SAY
WE COULDN'T DO IT.

18:48.850 --> 18:50.010

18:50.120 --> 18:51.121
IS THAT WHAT THIS IS?

18:51.230 --> 18:52.367

SHOULD WEIGH

18:53.920 --> 18:55.433
AS MUCH AS HERS.
- [sighs]

18:55.540 --> 18:57.428
WE SHOULD BE HELPING VICTOR
ESTABLISH NEW FRIENDSHIPS.

18:57.550 --> 18:58.676
THAT'S WHAT WE

18:58.790 --> 19:01.236

A FRIEND RIGHT NOW.

19:01.340 --> 19:02.375
HE JUST NEEDS A FRIEND.

SHE TOOK NORA UPSTAIRS
WHILE I HAD TO SIT DOWNSTAIRS

21:00.120 --> 21:01.257

21:01.360 --> 21:02.452
I HAD TO MAKE
PHIL LESSING TEA.

21:02.570 --> 21:04.629
IT'S JUST SO FRUSTRATING.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

21:04.740 --> 21:06.708
I FEEL LIKE A PRISONER
IN MY OWN HOME.

21:06.810 --> 21:08.744
- OH, SORRY. LISTEN, I'LL--
I'LL TALK TO HER.

21:08.850 --> 21:11.159

21:40.430 --> 21:42.159
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO NOT EAT
THIS CRAPPY FOOD

21:42.260 --> 21:45.536
THAT'S MAKING ME FEEL YUCKY AND
SUPPOSED TO BE HEALTHY FOR ME,

21:45.640 --> 21:48.359
OKAY?
AND I WANT MY MOM.

21:48.470 --> 21:50.574

I'M COMPLAINING RIGHT NOW,

21:56.310 --> 22:00.861
BUT I JUST SOMETIMES WISH
THAT THINGS WERE BACK TO NORMAL.

22:00.970 --> 22:03.279
AND I WISH THAT I COULD
JUST CRAWL UP IN A BALL

22:03.390 --> 22:07.417
AND CRY OVER IT,
BUT I CAN'T BECAUSE...

22:07.530 --> 22:10.875

29:23.520 --> 29:25.203
ISN'T HE, LIKE, EMBARRASSED?

HE'S LIKE A COLLEGE GUY
DATING SOME HIGH SCHOOL GIRL.

I MEAN, HE LOOKS LIKE 30.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

29:31.900 --> 29:33.765
ISN'T IT ILLEGAL ALSO

29:45.990 --> 29:47.981
- WHY? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

29:48.090 --> 29:50.957
- NOTHING. MY MOM DECIDED
TO MOVE IN WITH MR. CYR.

SO YOU KNOW,
NOW I LIVE WITH HIM

29:52.230 --> 29:53.743

30:49.330 --> 30:51.389
AND IF DAD ASKS,
GRANDMA PICKED YOU UP.

30:51.500 --> 30:52.592
I DID NOT PICK YOU UP.

30:52.710 --> 30:54.257
YOU GOT IT?

30:54.360 --> 30:58.501

A DIFFERENT KID.

31:41.270 --> 31:44.205

AND HE WAS HAVING--

31:44.310 --> 31:46.926
HE WAS HAVING A WONDERFUL TIME.
IT WAS REALLY SOMETHING.

BRING THAT OUT IN HIM.

31:59.330 --> 32:03.391
I WISH THAT WE COULD
MAKE HIM THAT HAPPY.

32:03.500 --> 32:05.127
I REALLY THOUGHT THAT
WE WERE MAKING PROGRESS...

SHE STARTS
CHEMOTHERAPY TOMORROW.

34:23.500 --> 34:28.403
YOU SHOULD SEE THESE WOMEN
AFTER THEY'VE BEEN IN CHEMO.

THE SEVENTH PERSON

37:14.880 --> 37:17.257
