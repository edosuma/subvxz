07:47.152 --> 07:48.452
I'm getting back into
the groove of things.

07:48.720 --> 07:49.880
- Why...
- Don't worry about it.

07:50.022 --> 07:51.455
Were you ever in the groove?

07:51.656 --> 07:53.089
(laughing)

07:53.324 --> 07:54.724
That was a funny joke.

07:55.159 --> 07:57.593
Look, Mike, I'm very concerned.
I don't want you to do this.

07:58.029 --> 08:00.389
It's just, I don't understand
why you let somebody like Jerry

08:00.631 --> 08:02.265
ruffle your feathers, quite literally.

08:02.666 --> 08:04.866
Okay, well, Jerry, he
doesn't know what's coming to him.

08:05.169 --> 08:08.209
Because I'm going to beat him to the
big, green lady with the ice cream thing.

08:08.339 --> 08:09.539
Mike, the big green lady
with the ice cream thing

08:09.564 --> 08:09.963
But, honey...

08:10.207 --> 08:11.506
- is half a mile.
- It's so far.

08:11.708 --> 08:12.708
- One way.
- Yeah.

08:12.742 --> 08:14.109
Guys, I have the vision for this.

08:14.510 --> 08:16.791
And if you believe in yourself,
and have the vision for it,

08:16.847 --> 08:18.680
that's half the battle
right there, guys.

08:18.882 --> 08:19.882
Am I right, Jacob?

08:20.016 --> 08:21.616
That's exactly right.

08:21.885 --> 08:22.925
He's actually got a point.

08:23.019 --> 08:24.019
Thank you!

08:24.054 --> 08:25.214
- Like, for my whole...
- He does?

08:25.555 --> 08:27.722
Yeah. For my whole life I
envisioned being a mommy,

08:27.990 --> 08:29.224
- and throughout that,
- Okay...

08:29.658 --> 08:32.025
everyone said, "You can't be
a mommy, you're a little boy."

08:32.328 --> 08:33.408
And then after that it was,

08:33.562 --> 08:34.828
"You can't be a mommy,
you're a teenager."

08:35.097 --> 08:35.996
And after that, people were like,

08:36.365 --> 08:38.432
"You can't be a mommy,
you're a grown man.

08:38.767 --> 08:40.735
"Please leave the premises
of the school zone."

08:40.936 --> 08:41.936
Now I'm a mommy.

08:42.238 --> 08:43.937
And Mike, I think you can do it, man.

08:44.239 --> 08:46.606
I'm gonna help you do this shit.

08:46.908 --> 08:48.268
- I... appreciate it.
- No, no, no, no.

08:48.542 --> 08:50.942
- I didn't... I don't need your help.
- No, no. Hey. Mike, listen.

08:51.212 --> 08:52.772
Don't worry about Jerry. (clicks tongue)

08:52.914 --> 08:54.114
I'll take care of him.

08:54.349 --> 08:57.017
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

08:57.352 --> 08:59.552
Let me guess, you're gonna seduce Jerry?

08:59.754 --> 09:01.553
How dare you.

09:04.191 --> 09:05.157
Jerry: Come here, you little maggot.

09:05.458 --> 09:06.858
Come here. Come here. Oww. Oww. Oww.

09:07.060 --> 09:09.929
Branch, I'm hard on you 'cause
I believe in you. Okay, kiddo?

09:10.397 --> 09:13.099
Sorry to interject, but I was just
noticing your parenting skills,

09:13.433 --> 09:15.193
and it's... It's
refreshing to see, honestly.

09:15.302 --> 09:16.468
Are you making fun of me?

09:16.703 --> 09:18.169
I am not. I'm not.

09:18.637 --> 09:21.139
I feel like parenting, it's just
gotten... It's like soft-serve ice cream.

09:21.440 --> 09:22.600
You know, it's just bullshit.

09:22.875 --> 09:24.042
- What's happened?
- It's a real shame they've gone so...

09:24.377 --> 09:25.476
Well, I'll tell you
what's happened with it.

09:25.711 --> 09:26.711
What's your name?

09:26.745 --> 09:28.105
- Phil. Phil. My name is Phil.
- Phil.

09:28.147 --> 09:29.214
- That's a beautiful name.
- Thank you.

09:29.481 --> 09:30.882
Phil, I'll tell you what happened.

09:31.250 --> 09:32.300
We forgot about what
our priorities were,

09:32.325 --> 09:32.674
Mm-hmm.

09:32.885 --> 09:33.885
And where we're from.

09:34.153 --> 09:35.313
Exactly. I'm from New Jersey.

09:35.453 --> 09:36.353
It was a different upbringing.

09:36.587 --> 09:37.587
You're from New Jersey?

09:37.655 --> 09:38.655
Yeah, what... Why?

09:38.957 --> 09:40.991
- I am from central New Jersey.
- Wow.

09:41.293 --> 09:43.227
It's so nice to meet someone from home

09:43.461 --> 09:44.828
- It is.

09:45.096 --> 09:46.596
Yeah, these pigeons are soft.

09:46.898 --> 09:48.732
You don't look soft, though.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.367
You don't look soft at all.

09:50.768 --> 09:52.668
- I'll tell you something right now, Phil.
- Yeah, what's that?

09:52.903 --> 09:53.937
I'm rock hard.

09:54.104 --> 09:55.704
Yeah.

Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

09:57.441 --> 09:58.841
Yeah, no, it's kind of nail on head,

looking everywhere for you.

23:35.811 --> 23:37.878
Oh. Uh, hi, Mike.

23:38.080 --> 23:39.080
Hello, Meghan.

23:39.280 --> 23:42.216
Well, I guess your son
and I will be leaving.

23:42.417 --> 23:43.984
Wait. I'm sorry.

23:44.385 --> 23:47.486
Look, I thought steroids
might mask my insecurities,

23:47.788 --> 23:50.156
and make me stronger and totally hot,

23:50.424 --> 23:52.025
and in some ways, they have.

23:52.559 --> 23:55.918
But I realize now that having the support
of my family is all I need to succeed.

23:56.496 --> 23:57.496
- Aww!
- Aww!

23:57.564 --> 23:58.564
(laughing)

23:58.833 --> 24:00.600
Oh, you big, dumb, idiot, I love you.

24:00.835 --> 24:02.901
You, dumb, dumb, loser.

24:03.169 --> 24:05.437
Haha, you shit-for-brains monster.

24:05.638 --> 24:06.638
Okay, well...

24:06.940 --> 24:08.260
You're a piece of garbage on legs.

24:08.407 --> 24:09.407
He is!

24:09.609 --> 24:10.542
Right, I don't know if
I'd say that, though.

24:10.810 --> 24:12.577
You gave me pigeon HPV,

24:12.812 --> 24:13.846
- Uh...
- That's for life.

24:14.147 --> 24:15.467
- Why would you...
- but I love you.

24:15.514 --> 24:16.681
And me, too.

24:16.850 --> 24:17.850
Thanks.

24:18.017 --> 24:20.785
♪

24:20.953 --> 24:22.519
Yoww!

24:22.955 --> 24:26.390
All right, all right, all right,
the race is beginning, boys!

24:26.591 --> 24:27.892
Places!

24:28.326 --> 24:30.394
Mike, get over here! Enough with
that sentimental shit, come on.

24:30.796 --> 24:33.164
All right, all right, are
we clear on the rules here?

24:33.531 --> 24:35.411
On the count of four,
when I drop my sexy hanky,

24:35.433 --> 24:36.634
the race will begin.

24:36.968 --> 24:38.448
Tick-tock, tick-tock. You ready, Mike?

24:38.770 --> 24:40.336
I'm ready. I'm ready as I'll ever be.

24:40.537 --> 24:41.537
Napkin's up.

24:41.605 --> 24:42.806
Here we go.

24:42.974 --> 24:43.974
Whew.

24:44.041 --> 24:45.242
One!

24:45.709 --> 24:48.178
Jerry, I love you so much.
Baby, you're gonna do so good.

24:48.345 --> 24:49.746
Two!

24:50.014 --> 24:51.982
Hey, Mike, Mike, right here.

24:52.150 --> 24:53.283
Three!

24:53.550 --> 24:55.717
Branch. Branch, look at Mommy.

24:55.952 --> 24:56.952
Mommy's doing it.

24:57.154 --> 24:59.354
What am I supposed to say to you now?

24:59.555 --> 25:00.990
- Man: Fore!
- Four!

25:01.158 --> 25:02.191
Oww!

25:02.392 --> 25:03.592
Baby, are you okay?

25:03.860 --> 25:05.360
- Oh, my...
- Are you okay?

25:05.796 --> 25:07.229
- I think I'm... I think I'm okay.
- Look at me, look at me.

25:07.397 --> 25:08.664
Wait, this...

25:08.965 --> 25:10.132
- Phil, this is...
- What? What?

25:10.500 --> 25:12.533
Look at... Look at...
Phil, this is your egg.

25:12.868 --> 25:13.802
Phil: Oh, there's a
bunch of 'em up here.

25:14.069 --> 25:15.309
Meghan: There's a bunch of them.

25:15.370 --> 25:17.170
This is not... Oh, God,
you know what this is?

25:17.239 --> 25:18.472
This is not an egg. This
is white guy white ball.

25:18.974 --> 25:21.454
Phil: What I thought was my egg
was just a white guy white ball?

25:21.677 --> 25:23.711
- Meghan: Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

25:23.979 --> 25:25.280
Oh, so, I'm not a mommy.

25:25.480 --> 25:27.148
Uh, well,

25:27.416 --> 25:29.516
Jer, it's been a lot of fun,

25:29.851 --> 25:31.051
- but, uh...
- Sorry, what's going on here?

25:31.352 --> 25:32.886
What the fuck is going on here?

25:33.221 --> 25:35.222
So, basically, just
to wrap everything up,

25:35.489 --> 25:37.291
I thought I was a mommy,

25:37.658 --> 25:40.760
'cause I found an egg
next to me when I woke up.

25:41.262 --> 25:43.630
It turns out, it's just a white guy white
ball from the white guy white ball game.

25:43.832 --> 25:44.832
And, uh...

25:45.065 --> 25:46.999
I'm a dude. So... peace.

25:47.234 --> 25:48.234
- Haha.
- Wait, what?

25:48.468 --> 25:49.318
Everyone shut up for just one second.

25:49.803 --> 25:50.870
- Okay.
- Sure.

25:51.305 --> 25:52.939
All right, first of all,
I was just hit in the head,

25:53.273 --> 25:54.340
so I don't know if I'm thinking right.

25:54.641 --> 25:55.708
Is this all really happening right now?

25:56.043 --> 25:57.443
- This is reality.
- It's all very real.

25:57.477 --> 25:58.610
- Definitely.
- And you guys know each other?

25:58.812 --> 25:59.812
- Yes.
- Yeah.

26:00.214 --> 26:01.247
- Yeah.
- Did you come to me to sabotage my race?

26:01.448 --> 26:02.547
- Yeah.
- Yes.

26:02.949 --> 26:04.909
Okay, sure, it was one
second of that. It was fine,

26:04.951 --> 26:07.111
but, you know, once we started
going, that was all real.

26:07.320 --> 26:09.020
Jer, Jer, come back to me, babe.

26:09.388 --> 26:10.176
These are the facts

26:10.201 --> 26:11.113
- that I know.
- Mm-hmm.

26:11.324 --> 26:12.924
I feel betrayed right now,

26:13.226 --> 26:15.126
but over the last couple days,

26:15.427 --> 26:16.667
I have felt happier than I have

26:16.963 --> 26:18.730
- in a very, very long time.
- Me, too.

26:18.997 --> 26:20.397
I'm gonna have a lot of therapy.

26:20.631 --> 26:22.066
It's a real short life,

26:22.400 --> 26:25.135
and I guess I'm a log cabin pigeon,

26:25.470 --> 26:28.105
because whether he's a male or a female,

26:28.406 --> 26:30.274
- I love Phil very much.
- Oh...

26:32.810 --> 26:34.478
This was gonna be a surprise.

26:34.913 --> 26:37.646
To celebrate our love, we're
gonna be having a reception

26:38.115 --> 26:39.096
at the top of the green lady with

26:39.121 --> 26:40.073
- the ice cream thing.
- Oh, my God.

26:40.417 --> 26:41.584
- Guys, what do you say?
- Let's go! (laughing)

26:41.986 --> 26:43.552
We're going to the big, green
lady with the ice cream thing.

26:43.787 --> 26:45.554
That's so wild!

26:45.822 --> 26:47.156
All right, who's ready to fly?

26:47.358 --> 26:48.424
Let's do this!

26:48.658 --> 26:49.759
- Whoo!
- Let's do this!

26:50.160 --> 26:51.494
Actually, so, how are we
gonna get there, we're gonna...

26:51.795 --> 26:53.075
- We're gonna fly.
- We'll fly there.

26:53.296 --> 26:54.396
We're gonna fly, you fucking pussy.

26:54.597 --> 26:55.597

Hey, folks, got into a big argument

and now you have to prove your
manliness to another Little League dad,

Hi, I'm Bartholomew Birdman.

I'm here to help you with all
that stuff that I just said.

27:26.961 --> 27:28.494
I have a revolutionary new product

27:28.963 --> 27:32.598
that will make you fly faster,
farther, and metaphorically further

27:32.900 --> 27:34.180

Texting is way better.

If it's a number I don't recognize,
it's usually like, "no thank you."

27:52.986 --> 27:55.087
Could be the authorities
trying to trap me.

27:55.355 --> 27:57.022
Anyway, I, uh... Text me now!
