00:16.599 --> 00:18.393
<i>What is creativity?</i>

00:19.894 --> 00:21.938
<i>There is no end to creativity.</i>

00:24.065 --> 00:26.359
<i>A technique or a concept</i>

00:26.443 --> 00:28.194
<i>is followed by another one,</i>

00:28.278 --> 00:30.155
<i>and another one</i>
<i>and another one.</i>

00:30.238 --> 00:32.073
<i>And there is no end.</i>

00:34.325 --> 00:36.619
<i>We play to discover</i>

00:37.829 --> 00:39.664
<i>the avant-garde.</i>

00:43.334 --> 00:44.961
<i>There aren't limits.</i>

00:45.545 --> 00:47.505
<i>There is total freedom.</i>

00:49.758 --> 00:52.343
<i>Let's say that we skip the rules.</i>

00:55.680 --> 00:57.640
<i>One plus one is three.</i>

01:01.478 --> 01:04.230
<i>If you always think</i>
<i>that one plus one is two,</i>

01:04.314 --> 01:06.524
<i>you will never do anything different.</i>

01:10.236 --> 01:13.198
Those who think
that one plus one is three

01:13.281 --> 01:14.949
are the ones who dare.

01:15.033 --> 01:16.743
They are the brave ones.

01:19.162 --> 01:21.081
They are the avant-garde.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.999
<i>Albert Adrià has been</i>
<i>the great hidden one.</i>

03:29.584 --> 03:32.295
<i>For his whole life, he has had to fight</i>

03:32.378 --> 03:34.172
against being "the brother of"

03:34.255 --> 03:38.593
when he had enough talent
to be Albert Adrià.

03:40.929 --> 03:44.807
<i>We had this man</i>
<i>who was a great pastry chef,</i>

03:44.891 --> 03:48.811
<i>this man who was</i>
<i>creative director of El Bulli, </i>

03:48.895 --> 03:52.482
<i>and now is the full orchestra conductor,</i>

03:52.565 --> 03:55.610
<i>responsible for everything.</i>

04:06.704 --> 04:08.039
-What's up?
-Hey, Chef.

05:12.395 --> 05:15.148
-Good afternoon, boys. How are you?
-Hello.

05:15.231 --> 05:16.399
Hello.

05:28.161 --> 05:32.498
Always work from the position
that you serve the client.

05:32.582 --> 05:36.377
That's how it's done.
You should serve this way. Okay?

05:49.057 --> 05:50.641
<i>Shut up and work.</i>

05:52.143 --> 05:55.354
<i>It's a short and simple motto.</i>

06:04.238 --> 06:06.199
<i>I'm very introverted.</i>

06:08.534 --> 06:13.206
I'm not good with the press.
I'm even worse with TV.

06:13.289 --> 06:20.088
I don't have the need
to have public recognition.

06:23.633 --> 06:26.052
<i>I've never sought fame.</i>

06:30.932 --> 06:32.642
<i>I believe in the team.</i>

06:34.811 --> 06:36.938
<i>The team is what I protect...</i>

06:40.108 --> 06:41.818
<i>not the individual.</i>

06:47.240 --> 06:48.825
<i>In fact,</i>

06:49.867 --> 06:54.664
<i>I think that they are giving</i>
<i>a little too much voice to chefs.</i>

07:02.588 --> 07:04.423
<i>Shut up and work.</i>

07:07.426 --> 07:10.763
It is a formula that has always
worked very well for me.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.880
How beautiful!

07:49.844 --> 07:55.683
Ladies and gentlemen...
<i>Mesdames et Messieurs...</i>

07:55.766 --> 08:00.646
welcome to the marvelous Raluy Legacy!

08:02.273 --> 08:04.150
<i>When we were little,</i>

08:04.233 --> 08:07.945
<i>my mother always took me to the circus</i>
<i>when it came to town.</i>

08:08.029 --> 08:09.864
Is it a crowd that likes magic?

08:09.947 --> 08:12.158
-Yes!
-Perfect.

08:13.034 --> 08:14.785
I love magic.

08:14.869 --> 08:17.121
To be a magician, you have to be bold,

08:17.205 --> 08:19.540
and I am bold.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.961
<i>Magic is an illusion.</i>

08:25.796 --> 08:29.926
<i>And we want to convey that illusion</i>
<i>at Tickets.</i>

09:24.564 --> 09:26.440
And voilà!

09:42.999 --> 09:44.417
See you later.

09:50.172 --> 09:51.382
Bye.

10:00.850 --> 10:03.519
It's been a long time
since you came here last, right?

10:05.980 --> 10:06.856
Look.

10:06.939 --> 10:10.568
Today I'm going to teach you.
We'll take advantage of being here.

10:10.651 --> 10:14.280
I'll show you where to buy things,

10:14.363 --> 10:16.240
<i>where we shop.</i>

10:16.324 --> 10:19.076
Is he your son?

10:19.160 --> 10:22.121
-Him? Yes.
-He's too handsome to be yours.

10:24.874 --> 10:28.252
<i>I was born in a neighborhood</i>
<i>called L'Hospitalet.</i>

10:28.753 --> 10:33.257
<i>It's a working-class neighborhood.</i>

10:34.967 --> 10:38.596
<i>This is a flower that smells like</i>
<i>a mandarin orange.</i>

10:39.180 --> 10:40.681
-A mandarin?
-Yeah.

10:42.433 --> 10:43.851
Smell.

10:44.393 --> 10:45.269
Wow!

10:47.188 --> 10:48.981
<i>I'm dyslexic,</i>

10:49.482 --> 10:55.863
<i>and that made me a little different</i>
<i>from most of the kids in my class.</i>

10:58.491 --> 11:01.452
<i>It's really hard for me to write.</i>

11:01.952 --> 11:05.998
And sometimes I have a little bit
of trouble talking, as you see.

11:10.127 --> 11:14.382
<i>In school, it was suffocating to sit there</i>
<i>for seven hours.</i>

11:15.883 --> 11:20.679
<i>Everything happened in slow motion,</i>
<i>and I couldn't remember any of it.</i>

11:25.267 --> 11:29.730
<i>When I was 15, I told my father,</i>
<i>"Dad, I don't want to study anymore."</i>

11:30.481 --> 11:32.858
<i>My father told me,</i>

11:33.442 --> 11:36.654
<i>"If you don't want to study,</i>
<i>you'll have to work."</i>

11:37.780 --> 11:40.032
<i>And, as it happens, my older brother,</i>

11:40.116 --> 11:42.993
Ferran, was appointed head chef
at El Bulli.

11:43.077 --> 11:46.372
<i>Ferran is almost eight years older.</i>

11:47.915 --> 11:50.751
<i>During my youth,</i>
<i>I practically never saw him.</i>

11:53.796 --> 11:58.509
<i>At El Bulli,</i>
<i>they needed inexpensive labor.</i>

11:58.592 --> 12:02.054
<i>I had no idea if I would like it or not.</i>

12:03.597 --> 12:06.809
<i>I had no idea what</i>
<i>the gastronomy world was.</i>

12:06.892 --> 12:09.353
<i>I knew absolutely nothing about life.</i>

12:12.022 --> 12:14.984
<i>But I always admired Ferran.</i>

12:15.067 --> 12:18.362
<i>So I decided to go to El Bulli.</i>

13:03.073 --> 13:05.659
We used to have a garden here.

13:05.743 --> 13:08.245
I barely remember it looking like this.

13:10.039 --> 13:11.957
The kitchen window.

13:12.791 --> 13:18.047
There's not much left
of what was originally El Bulli.

13:23.552 --> 13:28.724
<i>When I was 15 and Ferran was 22,</i>
<i>we reunited.</i>

13:28.807 --> 13:32.728
<i>Ferran and I began our adventures</i>
<i>at El Bulli.</i>

13:37.316 --> 13:40.402
<i>I just wanted to have some fun.</i>

13:43.781 --> 13:46.033
But I suppose that Ferran,
as my big brother,

13:46.116 --> 13:49.745
had a plan about what I had to do, right?

13:53.666 --> 13:55.292
They have changed everything.

13:55.376 --> 13:56.627
Shoot.

14:03.509 --> 14:06.762
<i>Back then,</i>
<i>El Bulli was a restaurant for insiders.</i>

14:06.845 --> 14:09.348
<i>It was not a well-known place.</i>

14:10.099 --> 14:12.268
El Bulli had a lot of downtime.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.900
<i>On many days, nobody came to eat.</i>

14:22.278 --> 14:28.742
<i>Ferran wouldn't stop going in circles,</i>
<i>looking for a solution.</i>

14:28.826 --> 14:30.619
<i>He was always a great leader.</i>

14:33.497 --> 14:37.209
<i>He filled the kitchen</i>
<i>with recipe books for me.</i>

14:38.544 --> 14:42.923
<i>From then on, we started acting</i>
<i>like big brother and little brother.</i>

14:47.386 --> 14:49.638
<i>It was the most beautiful period</i>
<i>of my life.</i>

14:53.058 --> 14:57.479
The staff had dinner at 6:30 p.m.
At 6:00 p.m., at 6:00 p.m.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.899
I can't remember
when they would have dinner.

14:59.982 --> 15:03.777
And I would sit here. I remember.

15:03.861 --> 15:05.487
It was here.

15:06.947 --> 15:08.532
Me.

15:08.616 --> 15:09.909
Juli.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.368
Ferran.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.543
The relationship
between the two brothers is incredible.

15:20.794 --> 15:26.634
<i>They built a brotherhood</i>
<i>which transcended the biological fact.</i>

15:28.093 --> 15:31.513
<i>They are brothers beyond blood.</i>

16:21.772 --> 16:24.775
We have the first dessert:

16:25.567 --> 16:26.986
the rose.

16:28.654 --> 16:31.156
Kiss the rose to eat just the sphere,

16:31.240 --> 16:34.493
made from lychee, raspberry,
and rose water.

16:34.576 --> 16:35.661
Cheers.

16:38.497 --> 16:41.417
<i>Here are the almond ice creams.</i>

16:41.500 --> 16:45.087
They have green almond chopped
on the exterior, a bit of olive oil,

16:45.170 --> 16:47.172
<i>and a little smoked flavor.</i>

16:47.256 --> 16:51.343
And the most important thing is
one of these two ice creams has a prize.

16:54.722 --> 16:57.975
<i>After one and a half years at El Bulli,</i>
<i>I became the pastry chef.</i>

16:58.684 --> 17:01.729
It was simple. Ferran was the chef
and I was the pastry chef.

17:04.148 --> 17:10.571
<i>We borrowed a few cakes, pies and fruits</i>
<i>from French cuisine.</i>

17:11.822 --> 17:14.658
<i>People really came just to eat</i>
<i>from the dessert cart,</i>

17:14.742 --> 17:18.120
<i>which was in style at that time.</i>

17:21.123 --> 17:23.751
<i>Back then, I was more traditionalist.</i>

17:25.127 --> 17:28.672
<i>Ferran was more prone to try everything.</i>

17:30.049 --> 17:32.176
<i>I needed to wake up.</i>

17:32.843 --> 17:39.558
<i>I had to evolve to keep up</i>
<i>with the speed of the savory kitchen.</i>

17:40.768 --> 17:43.437
<i>Which meant taking out the dessert cart,</i>

17:43.520 --> 17:46.899
<i>to commit to creativity</i>
<i>and to the avant-garde.</i>

18:19.640 --> 18:21.475
<i>In pastry,</i>

18:21.558 --> 18:25.104
<i>the image you can create</i>
<i>is in 360 degrees, in three dimensions.</i>

18:26.897 --> 18:27.773
<i>Whatever you want.</i>

18:30.901 --> 18:34.613
<i>When creating pastries, you are limitless.</i>

18:37.866 --> 18:39.493
<i>It was exciting.</i>

18:43.038 --> 18:45.207
<i>The world was opening before me.</i>

19:12.109 --> 19:13.402
You got it?

19:13.902 --> 19:17.114
Don't hold back. Go for it.

19:25.414 --> 19:28.709
It needs to be more cooked.
We need to slice it thinner.

19:28.792 --> 19:30.669
Actually, listen to me.
It should be fried.

19:30.752 --> 19:35.090
Fry, then chill it.
Then when it's cold, cut it.

19:40.470 --> 19:43.640
-It will be crispy like this.
-Yes, yes, like we did earlier.

20:49.915 --> 20:54.419
<i>Albert's role in the workshop</i>
<i>was to direct and command.</i>

20:56.255 --> 20:58.632
<i>He was the creative director.</i>

21:01.301 --> 21:05.264
<i>The obligation was to make</i>
<i>everything possible...</i>

21:06.765 --> 21:09.685
<i>to build a new language.</i>

21:42.759 --> 21:46.305
<i>I visited a food factory.</i>

21:47.431 --> 21:51.435
In their laboratory,
they had a bottle of sauce

21:51.518 --> 21:54.021
with little balls floating.

21:57.524 --> 22:00.986
<i>I quickly asked, "How is that done?"</i>

22:01.069 --> 22:03.947
<i>And the chemist handed me a bag of algae.</i>

22:07.284 --> 22:10.704
<i>I arrived back in Barcelona at 6:30 p.m.</i>
<i>and went to the workshop.</i>

22:11.288 --> 22:13.749
<i>I was alone in the workshop.</i>

22:15.334 --> 22:17.377
<i>I dissolved water with the alginate,</i>

22:18.420 --> 22:20.547
<i>and calcium with water.</i>

22:21.256 --> 22:24.885
<i>I took a spoon</i>
<i>and tossed the water in the bath.</i>

22:26.094 --> 22:30.640
<i>And when I lifted it out,</i>
<i>I saw that it created a membrane.</i>

22:30.724 --> 22:34.436
<i>When I punctured it,</i>
<i>there was liquid inside.</i>

22:36.188 --> 22:40.358
"Wow." I began to tremble and sweat.

22:41.026 --> 22:44.112
<i>I knew I had found something important.</i>

22:45.280 --> 22:47.824
<i>The first spherification was the olive.</i>

22:50.368 --> 22:52.996
<i>And I ask myself, "Where's the limit?"</i>

22:54.164 --> 22:57.667
<i>That moment,</i>
<i>I realized that I don't see a ceiling.</i>

22:59.461 --> 23:04.800
And from then on,
our techniques really took off.

23:33.245 --> 23:34.329
<i>The airs.</i>

23:34.412 --> 23:35.831
<i>The pancake.</i>

23:35.914 --> 23:37.707
<i>The sugar lamp.</i>

23:37.791 --> 23:41.253
<i>We didn't stop making things</i>
<i>that made no sense.</i>

23:43.421 --> 23:44.631
<i>I felt free.</i>

23:45.215 --> 23:48.677
<i>Everything was suddenly a world of color.</i>

24:20.834 --> 24:22.627
<i>Without the workshop,</i>

24:22.711 --> 24:25.881
El Bulli never would have been
what it became.

24:25.964 --> 24:26.798
It is impossible.

24:28.091 --> 24:34.264
<i>Albert was the person responsible,</i>
<i>more than Ferran, for all that progress.</i>

24:48.862 --> 24:50.739
Alberto, this is worth not one,

24:50.822 --> 24:52.908
but at least three meals at Enigma,

24:52.991 --> 24:54.367
plus five or six at Tickets.

24:54.451 --> 24:55.535
Just saying.

24:58.330 --> 24:59.998
Where are the tongs?

25:10.717 --> 25:14.221
These are XXL. Fuck.

25:20.060 --> 25:21.061
Cheers!

25:24.689 --> 25:26.691
<i>I really socialize very little.</i>

25:29.986 --> 25:33.573
<i>I am in a small circle of friends.</i>

25:36.034 --> 25:38.662
<i>We meet once or twice a week.</i>

25:42.040 --> 25:45.710
-Eight. How many are we?
-There's eight of us.

25:48.880 --> 25:52.842
<i>I'm not comfortable in the role of leader.</i>

25:57.138 --> 25:59.307
<i>I hardly ever give speeches.</i>

26:08.900 --> 26:11.361
<i>I hate social activities</i>

26:12.112 --> 26:15.448
<i>and etiquette parties.</i>

26:19.536 --> 26:21.955
<i>I like to work directly with my cooks.</i>

26:26.876 --> 26:29.337
<i>That's where I'm very comfortable, right?</i>

26:32.465 --> 26:36.011
Doing simple things, being normal.

27:07.709 --> 27:12.464
<i>2003, El Bulli has become an icon.</i>

27:15.300 --> 27:17.927
<i>Ferran has become very, very famous.</i>

27:20.972 --> 27:23.308
Time<i> magazine includes him</i>

27:23.391 --> 27:26.353
<i>among the 100 most important people</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

27:30.774 --> 27:35.195
Ferran is a person
with worldwide recognition,

27:39.199 --> 27:42.702
<i>who has become famous.</i>

27:50.251 --> 27:55.131
<i>His name, Ferran Adrià,</i>
<i>is just as powerful as El Bulli.</i>

27:57.675 --> 28:04.641
<i>There was a time in which Ferran</i>
<i>gave three or four interviews a day.</i>

28:07.519 --> 28:09.521
<i>Seven hundred or eight hundred a year.</i>

28:11.773 --> 28:14.818
<i>It was crazy, the amount of press</i>
<i>that came to the workshop.</i>

28:15.777 --> 28:17.445
It was really crazy.

28:21.324 --> 28:23.743
<i>It was very difficult</i>
<i>to concentrate and create </i>

28:23.827 --> 28:26.037
<i>with the press there all day.</i>

28:28.873 --> 28:30.708
<i>And Ferran knew it.</i>

28:34.629 --> 28:36.923
<i>It wore me down.</i>

28:41.636 --> 28:44.973
<i>I needed quiet in order to create.</i>

29:07.871 --> 29:10.582
Careful with leaving that on too long.

29:11.958 --> 29:14.169
It will keep cooking the meat.

29:32.228 --> 29:36.191
Concentrate the sauce.
Do you get what I'm saying?

29:36.274 --> 29:43.239
Concentrate the sauce
inside the perimeter of the peach.

29:43.323 --> 29:44.908
Sauce faster.

29:44.991 --> 29:48.912
You have to sauce all at once,
one time or one and a half maximum.

29:49.412 --> 29:50.663
That's it.

30:23.571 --> 30:26.282
<i>Albert had a very difficult role:</i>

30:26.866 --> 30:31.704
the obligation of permanent creativity.

30:34.249 --> 30:37.877
<i>Every year, he was forced</i>
<i>to discover new things,</i>

30:37.961 --> 30:40.421
<i>and he would do nothing</i>
<i>but work, work, work...</i>

30:41.005 --> 30:43.341
<i>with no other options.</i>

30:43.424 --> 30:45.385
<i>El Bulli had 1,800 dishes.</i>

30:47.428 --> 30:49.013
1,800 dishes.

30:52.016 --> 30:54.102
<i>I was focused on creativity, </i>

30:54.686 --> 30:58.273
<i>with the mentality that my brain</i>
<i>was always switched on.</i>

30:59.023 --> 31:01.568
<i>Whether buying clothes or at the movies,</i>

31:02.151 --> 31:03.361
<i>or at 3:00 in the morning,</i>

31:03.444 --> 31:05.405
<i>I was always plugged in.</i>

31:08.700 --> 31:10.577
<i>So many models,</i>

31:10.660 --> 31:11.744
<i>new techniques,</i>

31:11.828 --> 31:13.705
<i>new concepts.</i>

31:16.916 --> 31:18.167
<i>Well...</i>

31:18.751 --> 31:23.298
there is a certain feeling of torment.

31:26.885 --> 31:29.804
<i>And I said, "Man, this is unbearable.</i>

31:29.888 --> 31:35.184
<i>This is mad pressure.</i>
<i>This is getting out of hand."</i>

31:39.105 --> 31:43.109
<i>We had created a monster.</i>

31:46.571 --> 31:49.908
<i>I felt the need to break away</i>
<i>from everything.</i>

31:51.993 --> 31:53.953
<i>And I told Ferran,</i>

31:54.537 --> 31:58.333
"I can't stand it anymore.
I need my space."

32:05.632 --> 32:07.592
<i>And I decided to quit.</i>

33:04.607 --> 33:05.525
Picon.

33:06.109 --> 33:08.820
-Picon?
-We always serve Picon.

33:09.320 --> 33:10.530
Cheers!

33:15.910 --> 33:17.870
I needed something like that, dude.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.546
Fucking amazing.

33:31.843 --> 33:34.887
<i>When he decided to leave high-end cuisine,</i>

33:35.471 --> 33:36.973
<i>he was very radical.</i>

33:39.976 --> 33:41.686
<i>He wanted to control his own life.</i>

33:41.769 --> 33:44.147
He didn't want others to control it.

33:45.481 --> 33:48.735
<i>I wanted to do something</i>
<i>completely different.</i>

33:53.906 --> 33:56.659
<i>My idea was to open a tapas bar.</i>

33:57.618 --> 34:02.081
<i>I wanted to remove</i>
<i>all my arsenal of techniques.</i>

34:03.082 --> 34:06.085
And I wanted to focus
on the concept of fun.

34:09.005 --> 34:11.716
<i>El Bulli closed and I opened up Tickets, </i>

34:12.467 --> 34:15.053
<i>my big solo project.</i>

34:17.555 --> 34:19.599
<i>We had to start from scratch.</i>

34:21.934 --> 34:26.147
<i>I started with Galician empanadas.</i>
<i>I started with fried fish.</i>

34:31.235 --> 34:33.738
<i>I had the customer one meter</i>
<i>in front of me</i>

34:33.821 --> 34:37.075
<i>so I could see quickly what worked...</i>

34:38.201 --> 34:39.535
<i>and what didn't.</i>

34:41.704 --> 34:46.667
<i>I immediately realized I wasn't serving</i>
<i>what the customers expected.</i>

34:49.462 --> 34:54.175
<i>People looked at their food and said,</i>
<i>"I've been waiting three months for this?"</i>

34:58.096 --> 35:02.141
<i>Many people thought</i>
<i>we were going to do a new El Bulli.</i>

35:04.352 --> 35:07.814
<i>And I told them,</i>
<i>"Hey, no, this isn't El Bulli."</i>

35:13.486 --> 35:16.697
<i>They must have been asking themselves</i>

35:16.781 --> 35:19.909
<i>if I really was the brother</i>
<i>of Ferran Adrià.</i>

35:25.957 --> 35:28.459
<i>The first days were heartbreaking.</i>

35:30.461 --> 35:31.963
I was scared.

35:32.046 --> 35:33.673
Really afraid.

35:38.636 --> 35:41.681
<i>At that moment, I realized</i>

35:41.764 --> 35:45.476
I didn't have a story to tell.
We didn't have our voice.

35:48.771 --> 35:51.232
<i>My past wouldn’t leave me in peace.</i>

35:57.822 --> 36:00.575
<i>El Bulli was like a ghost.</i>

36:13.045 --> 36:17.216
So many years here, so many memories.

36:24.348 --> 36:25.725
The pastry kitchen.

36:26.392 --> 36:28.769
Twenty-three years of my life here.

36:39.947 --> 36:43.868
<i>I wanted to end the "brother of" cliché.</i>

36:46.913 --> 36:48.789
<i>I had to re-evaluate.</i>

36:59.133 --> 37:01.844
<i>I had to go back to the avant-garde.</i>

37:09.393 --> 37:12.772
<i>When you are avant-garde,</i>
<i>you have two options: </i>

37:13.522 --> 37:16.525
you either get killed
or you find a new way.

37:19.737 --> 37:25.034
<i>We worked 15 hours a day</i>
<i>to create Tickets' own style.</i>

37:28.037 --> 37:30.706
<i>I felt 100% creative.</i>

37:31.290 --> 37:33.376
<i>We were evolving.</i>

37:35.086 --> 37:38.381
<i>People tried their food and said, "Wow!"</i>

37:41.634 --> 37:44.553
<i>I could feel the vibration and that power.</i>

38:16.502 --> 38:19.588
<i>For 25 years,</i>
<i>I was comfortable in the shadow.</i>

38:21.090 --> 38:22.883
<i>But I have my own dignity.</i>

38:27.555 --> 38:31.475
<i>I had to become the monster</i>

38:31.976 --> 38:33.769
because I'm El Bulli.

39:05.634 --> 39:07.219
<i>What does a person like Albert do</i>

39:07.887 --> 39:09.972
<i>after he's reached the top of his craft?</i>

39:13.684 --> 39:15.436
<i>What is his future?</i>

39:16.354 --> 39:17.271
<i>I have no idea.</i>

39:18.856 --> 39:22.485
<i>But I know, for Albert,</i>
<i>the sky is the limit.</i>

40:52.992 --> 40:54.285
Well, yes.

40:54.785 --> 40:58.747
I saw a documentary

40:58.831 --> 41:05.421
about the gastronomic revolution

41:05.921 --> 41:08.632
which took place in Spain, and fuck...

41:10.092 --> 41:13.471
I appeared 20 seconds.

41:14.889 --> 41:16.765
So I said,

41:18.017 --> 41:24.982
"Fuck, they're talking about many things,

41:25.566 --> 41:29.487
which I was, at the minimum, the co-star."

41:30.154 --> 41:36.494
<i>As a matter of fact,</i>
<i>two days ago a story came out:</i>

41:37.036 --> 41:40.289
<i>"Ferran Adrià</i>
<i>and his brother, blah, blah..."</i>

41:42.166 --> 41:45.794
<i>In the most important newspaper</i>
<i>of the country, they said,</i>

41:45.878 --> 41:47.630
<i>"Ferran Adrià and his brother."</i>

41:48.297 --> 41:50.007
<i>Hey, I have a name, too.</i>

41:52.092 --> 41:55.387
<i>I've earned the right to be Albert Adrià.</i>

41:57.806 --> 42:01.101
It's something that, at least,
made me think.

42:01.685 --> 42:05.731
Then... So...

42:08.150 --> 42:11.445
I'm working on being remembered.
