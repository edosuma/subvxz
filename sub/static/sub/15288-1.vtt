where you stand today.

00:43.510 --> 00:45.577
Few have been chosen.

00:48.581 --> 00:52.418
Even fewer have passed the test.

00:54.187 --> 00:56.755
You have a chance
to do both tonight.

03:18.598 --> 03:21.733
(tires screeching)

03:23.369 --> 03:24.303
- Get the fuck out!

03:24.305 --> 03:25.637
- I don't have any money!

03:25.639 --> 03:26.638
- I don't give a shit,
get the fuck out,

03:26.640 --> 03:27.673
I don't want your money.

03:27.675 --> 03:29.208
- Take the car!

03:29.210 --> 03:31.276
- Get the fuck in there! Get in!

03:31.278 --> 03:31.944
- Fuck that!

(grunts)

03:51.898 --> 03:53.732
(pounding)

03:55.435 --> 03:57.502
- Somebody tell me what
the hell is going on here?

03:58.738 --> 04:00.405
Hello! What the
fuck is going on?

04:00.407 --> 04:01.740
- None of us know.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.909
- Those motherfuckers are dead,

04:03.911 --> 04:05.410
that's what I know.

04:05.412 --> 04:06.612
- How long have
you been in here?

04:06.614 --> 04:08.947
- I was the first, that
was a long time ago.

04:08.949 --> 04:11.483
- [Voiceover] I don't
know what time it is.

04:12.619 --> 04:13.885
- Around three.

04:13.887 --> 04:15.821
- God, they got me
on my way to work.

04:15.823 --> 04:16.721
That was...

04:18.458 --> 04:19.591
That was nine hours ago.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.026
- Nine hours?

04:21.028 --> 04:22.694
And you're just
fucking sitting here?

04:22.696 --> 04:24.896
- I'd rather sit here
than get shot, man.

04:27.300 --> 04:29.635
(kicking)

04:29.637 --> 04:31.303
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

04:32.740 --> 04:35.407
- 'Cause you're gonna
get us all killed.

04:35.409 --> 04:36.875
- If they wanted you dead,
you'd be dead already.

04:36.877 --> 04:40.712
- Thanks for clarifying that.

04:44.350 --> 04:46.285
- Have you tried rushin'
them when they open the door?

04:47.287 --> 04:47.886
- No.

04:47.888 --> 04:49.588
- [Voiceover] Why not?

04:49.590 --> 04:51.390
- Because it's just me and
four females back here.

04:51.392 --> 04:53.625
- You think just because they
haven't used their guns yet,

04:53.627 --> 04:54.726
they don't plan on it?

04:58.031 --> 04:59.631
- You and me then.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.767
- Woah, woah, wait
a second, alright?

05:01.769 --> 05:04.303
Plenty of hostage situations
have been resolved

05:04.305 --> 05:05.637
without anyone dying.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.706
- I got $17 in my
checking account.

05:09.442 --> 05:11.743
- I got a couple
thousand, I'm not rich.

05:12.945 --> 05:14.613
- It's not about money.

05:16.416 --> 05:17.883
Any reason someone would
have it out for you?

05:19.085 --> 05:21.653
- Plenty of fools
have it out for me.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.822
But they're not smart
enough to do it like this,

05:23.824 --> 05:25.090
and if they were,

05:25.092 --> 05:26.958
they'd have killed
my ass by now.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.060
Not put me in the
back of the van

05:28.062 --> 05:30.395
with four fuckin' strangers.

05:31.964 --> 05:35.600
But I'm with you, we'll
get 'em on the next stop.

05:38.871 --> 05:47.779
(kicking door)

05:51.884 --> 05:54.553
- You, fuck face, let's go.

05:54.555 --> 05:55.354
- Me?

05:55.356 --> 05:56.355
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

05:58.791 --> 06:00.492
- Why? I didn't do anything.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.694
- [Voiceover] Then you can
blame the other guys, come on.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.598
Come on, get the
fuck out of here.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.401
(shouting)

06:11.003 --> 06:12.738
(laughs)

06:13.373 --> 06:16.007
Hey, on your knees, get
down on your fuckin' knees.

06:16.009 --> 06:18.076
- [Voiceover] Oh,
so fuckin' sorry,

06:18.078 --> 06:21.480
Fuck around, fuck around,
then you won't be around.

06:21.482 --> 06:22.447
(gun shot)

06:26.719 --> 06:29.821
(heavy breathing)

06:34.527 --> 06:37.729
(vomits)

06:41.801 --> 06:51.843
(suspenseful music)

06:51.845 --> 06:57.616
(suspenseful music)

07:01.020 --> 07:03.555
- Okay, there has to be
some common factor among us.

07:04.490 --> 07:05.524
What do you do?

07:06.692 --> 07:07.859
- I sell timeshares.

07:07.861 --> 07:09.127
(scoffs)

07:09.129 --> 07:11.062
- Reason enough to
kill you right there.

07:11.064 --> 07:12.697
- I'm guessing you make
your money differently?

07:13.766 --> 07:15.801
- Look your nose
down at me again,

07:15.803 --> 07:16.868
and I'll break it off.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.203
- Easy.

07:22.675 --> 07:24.009
You got a nine to five?

07:26.078 --> 07:28.180
- I work in a warehouse.

07:28.182 --> 07:29.047
- And you?

07:29.982 --> 07:31.116
- I work for my father.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.050
(snorts)

07:32.052 --> 07:33.919
- So you don't work.

07:33.921 --> 07:35.620
- Look, I have money, alright?

07:35.622 --> 07:37.756
But that doesn't explain
why they took all you guys.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.225
- How about you?

07:42.528 --> 07:43.762
- I teach kids.

07:44.964 --> 07:46.198
Elementary school.

07:48.000 --> 07:48.867
- And you?

07:50.503 --> 07:52.137
- I'm in between jobs.

07:54.507 --> 07:56.508
- Are you sure this
is what you wanna do?

07:58.144 --> 07:59.611
- Yes.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.647
- [Voiceover] You
don't do this for me,

08:02.649 --> 08:04.749
you're not doin' it
for your grandfather,

08:04.751 --> 08:05.884
you do it for you.

08:05.886 --> 08:10.622
- I know.

08:14.827 --> 08:16.228
- Recruits.

08:16.230 --> 08:18.930
Today is not going to be fun.

08:18.932 --> 08:22.100
Tomorrow is not going to be fun,

08:22.102 --> 08:24.169
and if you're somehow able
to complete my training

08:24.171 --> 08:26.271
to gain entry to
my Marine Corps,

08:26.273 --> 08:28.006
most of the days of the
remainder of your lives

08:28.008 --> 08:30.108
will not be fun.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.644
But that's why we
are who we are.

08:32.645 --> 08:34.679
That's what separates us.

08:34.681 --> 08:37.682
We have the strength to
do what other men can not.

08:37.683 --> 08:40.751
We do, but I'm not
sure if you do.

08:42.000 --> 08:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here

08:55.735 --> 08:57.235
- So are you in a
gang or something?

08:58.304 --> 08:59.938
I'm asking because I'm wondering

08:59.940 --> 09:02.607
if you've heard of
anything like this before.

09:02.609 --> 09:04.809
- What, kidnapping a
bunch of strangers?

09:06.078 --> 09:07.846
Nah.

09:07.848 --> 09:10.916
- They're gonna cut us up
and eat us, aren't they?

09:10.918 --> 09:13.818
I read this article about
cannibalism in America--

09:13.820 --> 09:15.086
- [Voiceover] Shut up.

09:16.789 --> 09:18.990
- They're probably gonna
kill us either way.

09:18.992 --> 09:21.293
- [Voiceover] Look, if they
were gonna just murder us,

09:21.295 --> 09:23.328
wouldn't they have
done it by now?

09:23.330 --> 09:26.031
- Nah. They wanna
take us somewhere

09:26.033 --> 09:29.100
where they can enjoy it.

09:44.650 --> 09:46.718
- Hey! Outta the van, ladies!

09:47.787 --> 09:49.354
Let's go! Get the fuck out.

09:53.192 --> 09:58.863
- [Voiceover] Line up
next to each other.

10:03.235 --> 10:04.169
- The fuck?

10:04.171 --> 10:06.237
- Yeah, I missed you too.

10:06.239 --> 10:08.807
- In case you didn't
believe me earlier,

10:08.809 --> 10:12.711
we are in control
of the situation.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.679
The best way to
get through this?

10:14.681 --> 10:16.815
Is to follow instructions.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.083
(intense music)

10:20.019 --> 10:21.286
- Next one to try
that is gonna get

10:21.288 --> 10:27.859
their fuckin' head blown off!

10:32.064 --> 10:37.902
(grunting)

10:42.208 --> 10:44.242
(thump)

10:48.648 --> 10:50.248
- Who's this?

10:50.250 --> 10:51.783
- [Voiceover] Part
of the ceremony.

10:51.785 --> 10:53.385
What are you doing out here?

10:53.387 --> 10:54.786
- Just having a smoke.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.688
Break time's over.

10:56.690 --> 11:04.329
Help me get him inside.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.834
- [Voiceover] Back
up, back the fuck up.

11:13.706 --> 11:15.240
Get back.

11:19.845 --> 11:28.820
(grunting)

11:32.858 --> 11:35.026
- Get your ass kicked?

11:35.028 --> 11:36.361
- The fuck you think?

11:36.363 --> 11:37.228
(chuckles)

11:41.067 --> 11:42.701
- How far did you get?

11:43.736 --> 11:44.903
- Not far enough.

11:49.075 --> 11:50.475
I saw my car.

11:51.477 --> 11:52.744
- What?

11:52.746 --> 11:53.878
- I saw my car.

11:53.880 --> 11:54.746
- Where?

11:56.082 --> 11:57.716
Where?

11:57.718 --> 11:59.250
- I don't know, but
there were a few of 'em.

12:00.252 --> 12:02.153
- There's a gun in
my glove compartment.

12:03.189 --> 12:04.923
- A gun?

12:04.925 --> 12:05.890
What type of car?

12:05.892 --> 12:07.258
- White pick up.

12:10.296 --> 12:12.063
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.298
I need you to tell me everything

12:13.300 --> 12:15.200
you remember about
the walk over here.

12:15.202 --> 12:18.269
- Straight line,
about 200 yards or so.

12:18.271 --> 12:19.504
(door opening)

12:21.907 --> 12:23.742
- What's up, bitches?

12:23.744 --> 12:25.276
Gettin' cozy in there?

12:29.749 --> 12:30.849
- You happy now?

12:32.351 --> 12:34.486
You're gonna have a fun night.

12:34.488 --> 12:37.922
- Alright let's go,
wallets, ID's, watches.

12:40.126 --> 12:42.026
- It wasn't a request.

12:42.028 --> 12:43.161
- Relax.

12:45.531 --> 12:47.165
So what is this, some cult?

12:48.467 --> 12:50.535
Seriously, who are you guys?

12:53.472 --> 12:54.973
- Y'all ain't shit.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.375
Nothin' but a bunch
of crazy motherfuckers

12:57.377 --> 12:59.844
with a house and
this goddamned cage.

13:03.916 --> 13:06.084
- You wanna know who we are?

13:10.489 --> 13:12.290
In ancient Rome,

13:12.292 --> 13:15.493
they used to flood the coliseum.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.562
Reenact famous naval battles.

13:19.498 --> 13:21.232
Hundreds of people would die.

13:23.102 --> 13:28.173
Even today, you're either
dyin' or watchin' the show.

13:31.544 --> 13:34.245
We're the ones who decide
who gets in the boat.

13:36.215 --> 13:39.517
- Don't worry, we'll see
you all again real soon.

13:41.854 --> 13:46.991
- [Voiceover] Simon.

13:51.130 --> 13:52.864
- They know who we are now.

13:52.866 --> 13:54.332
Even if we try to escape,

13:54.334 --> 13:56.167
they got a better
chance to track us down.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.402
- Damn.

13:57.404 --> 13:59.003
I'm tellin' you, they're
gonna fuckin' eat us.

13:59.005 --> 14:00.505
- Come on, man.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.507
If you don't shut up, I'm
gonna fuckin' eat you.

14:02.509 --> 14:03.908
- Stop it.

14:03.910 --> 14:05.276
They kept those
Americans in Iran hostage

14:05.278 --> 14:07.078
for 444 days, didn't they?

14:07.080 --> 14:08.546
- No, no, you weren't
listening, man,

14:08.548 --> 14:09.981
this isn't political.

14:09.983 --> 14:11.316
- What are you suggesting then?

14:11.318 --> 14:13.284
- I don't know, skull and bones.

14:13.286 --> 14:14.552
Illuminati, that kind of thing.

14:14.554 --> 14:15.887
- I don't believe these
punks are connected

14:15.889 --> 14:17.288
to anyone of real power.

14:17.290 --> 14:26.865
- And you are?

14:30.603 --> 14:32.170
- Bury him with Pleb Gold.

14:32.172 --> 14:37.475
- Serves the son
of a bitch right.

14:41.080 --> 14:45.617
- Very few men have stood
where you stand today.

14:47.286 --> 14:50.255
Few have been chosen.

14:50.257 --> 14:53.925
Even fewer have passed the test.

14:55.494 --> 14:58.062
You have a chance
to do both tonight.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.132
Remember that every one of us

15:01.134 --> 15:05.270
has gone through what
you're about to go through.

15:07.273 --> 15:08.273
- I can bribe him.

15:09.174 --> 15:11.242
- That's a good idea.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.477
- Money won't work.

15:12.479 --> 15:16.648
- There's a big different
someone who's hard,

15:16.650 --> 15:19.250
and someone who's
just damn crazy.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.653
- Once you've become initiated,

15:21.655 --> 15:26.925
you are sworn by blood
to protect our identity,

15:28.494 --> 15:30.962
and keep our secrets.

15:32.264 --> 15:35.433
No one, apart from our brothers,

15:35.435 --> 15:38.002
can ever know who we are.

15:40.706 --> 15:42.140
Now...

15:45.010 --> 15:47.578
Remove your blindfolds.

15:51.583 --> 15:55.119
Before each of you,
your member's Code.

15:55.121 --> 16:00.191
This book defines what
it means to be a brother.

16:00.993 --> 16:03.461
It also contains expectations

16:03.463 --> 16:08.533
that we consider binding on
any man who signs his name.

16:12.638 --> 16:15.239
You may sign your book tonight,

16:15.241 --> 16:19.544
but only after completing
the final challenge.

16:19.546 --> 16:23.414
Open the folders
in front of you.

16:37.763 --> 16:39.197
- Hello!

16:40.566 --> 16:43.668
Hello! Anybody out there?

16:47.506 --> 16:50.008
- Thought there'd
be masks and ropes.

16:50.010 --> 16:52.276
- It's all part of the
process, man, go with it.

16:53.612 --> 16:57.148
- [Voiceover] Hello!
Anybody out there?

16:57.150 --> 16:59.117
- Keep your fuckin' mouths shut.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.018
- [Voiceover] Tell him.

17:01.353 --> 17:02.453
- Tell me what?

17:03.455 --> 17:04.622
- We can make you a deal.

17:06.657 --> 17:08.626
- How does five
million dollars sound?

17:11.530 --> 17:13.297
- Five million?

17:15.534 --> 17:18.169
Why should I believe that
you have that kind of money?

17:18.171 --> 17:20.637
you have access to a
computer, you can look it up.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.306
I have that kind of money.

17:22.308 --> 17:24.142
I can have it for you
in cash in one hour.

17:25.243 --> 17:26.810
Come on, I just
wanna go home, okay?

17:26.813 --> 17:28.780
No one will come
looking for you.

17:31.150 --> 17:34.152
- Five million each
makes more sense to me.

17:34.154 --> 17:36.454
- No, come on, that's too much.

17:36.456 --> 17:38.489
- Oh, well.

17:38.491 --> 17:41.259
- [Voiceover] Okay,
10 million dollars.

17:41.261 --> 17:43.661
For all of us, that's
the best I can do.

17:46.665 --> 17:48.666
- No, fuck yourselves.

17:48.668 --> 17:51.169
You guys sit tight, and keep
your fucking mouths shut,

17:51.171 --> 17:52.370
I'll come back down
here and kick your--

17:52.372 --> 17:54.205
- 10 million for just me.

17:56.542 --> 18:00.678
- You're gonna leave these
poor bastards to die?

18:00.680 --> 18:03.081
And you're never
gonna tell anyone,

18:03.083 --> 18:04.215
for the rest of your life?

18:04.217 --> 18:05.750
- Never.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.251
- I like you, Rob.

18:08.654 --> 18:10.621
You remind me why I do this.

18:12.525 --> 18:15.693
- [Rob] No, no no no! You
can't leave me down here!

18:18.864 --> 18:22.133
- You've all proven
yourself worthy,

18:22.135 --> 18:26.671
and earned the privilege of
completing the final challenge.

18:26.673 --> 18:30.174
You do this voluntarily...

18:32.544 --> 18:33.811
Or not at all.

18:35.514 --> 18:39.717
Any man who wishes
not to proceed...

18:42.321 --> 18:46.591
Step back immediately.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.263
Let's begin.

18:53.565 --> 18:54.432
(clapping)

18:54.434 --> 18:55.533
Let's go boys.

18:57.336 --> 18:58.369
Let's go boys.

18:58.371 --> 18:59.270
- Alright.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.507
Let's do this.

19:02.509 --> 19:04.709
- [Voiceover] Oh they're
scared, look at them.

19:05.677 --> 19:07.645
- They look terrified.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.614
- Yeah, yeah.

19:09.616 --> 19:12.884
The Asian one offered
me 10 million dollars.

19:12.886 --> 19:14.619
They're scared shitless.

19:16.855 --> 19:17.788
- Let's get 'em ready, huh?

19:17.790 --> 19:19.457
- Yeah.

19:19.459 --> 19:20.725
Listen up.

19:21.727 --> 19:24.362
You're out in the middle
of fuckin' nowhere,

19:24.364 --> 19:26.664
as I'm sure this
cocksucker can tell you.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.399
Now there's a reason
that we haven't

19:28.401 --> 19:29.634
lit your cars on fire.

19:31.703 --> 19:34.906
Each one of you is gonna
be fighting one of them.

19:36.675 --> 19:40.278
If you win your fight,
you win your freedom.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.313
If you lose, you're dead.

19:43.315 --> 19:46.350
Am I speaking fucking Chinese?

19:46.352 --> 19:47.818
(mumbles)

19:47.820 --> 19:49.954
The fight will continue
until someone is dead,

19:49.956 --> 19:53.224
if it's not you then you
can walk out that door.

19:53.226 --> 19:55.760
- Man you can't even risk
us goin' to the cops.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.595
- Who said we're not cops?

19:58.964 --> 20:02.667
The house you're in belongs
to a very influential man.

20:05.204 --> 20:05.870
Rob?

20:08.607 --> 20:09.640
You're first.

20:09.642 --> 20:10.775
- What if we say no?

20:12.344 --> 20:14.779
- Then it's gonna
be a short fight.

20:14.781 --> 20:15.846
- Why am I going first?

20:15.848 --> 20:17.682
- Hey, you got this.

20:17.684 --> 20:19.717
Come on, man up! You
got this, come on!

20:19.719 --> 20:23.487
- Green! On me. Circle up.

20:24.923 --> 20:27.458
You're supposed
to feel like this.

20:27.460 --> 20:30.595
Take take the first
punch, it'll all go away.

20:30.597 --> 20:31.963
- Let's go Rob.

20:31.965 --> 20:32.897
- No.

20:32.899 --> 20:33.931
- Understand?

20:33.933 --> 20:35.700
- Yes sir.

20:35.702 --> 20:36.601
- You got this.

20:36.603 --> 20:38.669
- You got this.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.838
- [Rob] No, no. No, please, no.

20:42.274 --> 20:42.840
No no.

20:44.744 --> 20:47.745
- [Voiceover] Back up,
come on, get over here!

20:52.484 --> 20:53.784
- Fight.

20:54.586 --> 20:56.988
- [Rob] Please, I
don't wanna do this.

20:56.990 --> 20:59.290
- Full speed, execute.

20:59.292 --> 21:02.927
(shouting)

21:04.796 --> 21:06.364
(grunting)

21:08.533 --> 21:09.700
Recover recruits.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.736
(shouting)

21:14.273 --> 21:17.008
- Please, please I
don't wanna do this.

21:17.010 --> 21:18.576
- [Voiceover] Hit him already!

21:20.545 --> 21:21.812
- [All] Hey!

21:21.814 --> 21:23.614
(laughing)

21:25.417 --> 21:26.550
- Please.

21:26.552 --> 21:27.485
Please, please, please,
I'm begging you,

21:27.487 --> 21:28.686
please don't make me do this!

21:30.822 --> 21:32.990
(slow motion whir)

21:37.596 --> 21:39.063
(grunting)

21:41.400 --> 21:42.867
- [Voiceover] Get him off you!

21:42.869 --> 21:44.835
Get that little bitch off you!

21:48.674 --> 21:52.043
(yelling)

21:52.045 --> 21:53.344
(thump)

21:56.982 --> 21:59.984
(shouting)

21:59.986 --> 22:01.652
- [Voiceover] You
got this Green.

22:01.654 --> 22:02.353
(shouting)

22:05.791 --> 22:07.658
- [Voiceover] If you lose to
this little fucking bitch,

22:07.660 --> 22:08.926
I swear to god.

22:13.065 --> 22:15.533
- Every opponent is different.

22:15.535 --> 22:17.068
Your job is the same.

22:21.406 --> 22:23.074
(grunting)

22:24.743 --> 22:26.344
(yelling)

22:28.613 --> 22:29.914
- That's it! That's it!

22:31.350 --> 22:34.051
(yelling)

22:36.588 --> 22:38.789
- Yeah! That's right!

22:40.492 --> 22:43.961
(grunting)

22:48.800 --> 22:51.569
- Were you asked to
incapacitate a man?

22:51.571 --> 22:53.371
- [All] No sir.

22:53.373 --> 22:55.606
- Were you asked to
fight a man to his death?

22:55.608 --> 22:57.842
- [All] Yes sir.

22:57.844 --> 23:00.578
- Finish your job.

23:04.850 --> 23:14.892
(grunting)

23:14.894 --> 23:20.798
(grunting)

23:25.103 --> 23:26.036
Winner!

23:26.038 --> 23:30.841
(cheering)

23:34.980 --> 23:44.088
Go get yourself cleaned up.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.761
You have crossed
over Noah Grant.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.196
We offer you membership.

23:53.765 --> 23:55.566
Do you accept?

23:55.568 --> 23:57.635
- I do.

24:18.757 --> 24:19.757
- Welcome.

24:20.959 --> 24:23.761
(clapping)

24:23.763 --> 24:25.830
Well done.

24:47.752 --> 24:49.620
- Initiation rites.

24:50.622 --> 24:52.556
Gangs do stuff like this, yeah?

24:53.725 --> 24:54.959
- Not like this.

24:57.496 --> 24:58.496
(crying)

24:58.498 --> 24:59.930
- I don't wanna do this.

25:00.932 --> 25:02.800
- I'ma take him one on with me.

25:04.269 --> 25:05.836
- I can't win.

25:08.039 --> 25:10.508
I've never even been
in a fight before.

25:11.810 --> 25:14.011
- You just gotta want it
more than the other guy.

25:18.583 --> 25:19.250
(shout)

25:22.587 --> 25:24.255
- Left side, down!

25:25.757 --> 25:26.724
Up!

25:27.993 --> 25:29.660
Right side, down!

25:30.762 --> 25:31.662
And up!

25:31.664 --> 25:32.963
- [All] Two!

25:32.965 --> 25:34.865
- Left side, down!

25:36.201 --> 25:36.867
Up!

25:36.869 --> 25:37.668
- [All] Three!

25:37.670 --> 25:40.237
marines didn't spend a
lot of time carrying logs.

25:40.239 --> 25:41.672
- [Sergeant] Down!

25:41.674 --> 25:44.108
- [All] One, two, three,
one, one, two, three,

25:44.110 --> 25:48.178
two, one, two, three,
three, one, two, three,

25:48.180 --> 25:51.649
four, one, two, three,
five, one, two--

25:51.651 --> 25:53.017
- [Sergeant] Little louder!

25:53.019 --> 25:54.752
- [All] One, two, three, seven--

25:54.754 --> 25:56.053
- [Sergeant] I can't hear you.

25:56.055 --> 25:57.988
- [All] Eight, one, two, three--

25:57.990 --> 25:59.256
- [Sergeant] Crunch 'em up.

25:59.258 --> 26:01.058
Bring those knees
to your elbows!

26:01.060 --> 26:04.728
- [All] Two, three, eleven,
one, two, three, twelve--

26:04.730 --> 26:05.930
- I can't tell him.

26:05.932 --> 26:07.698
Are you tired?

26:08.567 --> 26:11.135
Come on, get your knees up,
there's no quittin', son.

26:11.137 --> 26:13.637
There is no quitting.

26:13.639 --> 26:15.739
Full speed, execute.

26:18.176 --> 26:19.777
(weak grunting)

26:19.779 --> 26:21.612
Recruits.

26:21.614 --> 26:23.681
Are you conserving
energy doing my drill?

26:23.683 --> 26:24.715
- No sir.

26:24.717 --> 26:25.950
- Step out, recruit.

26:29.187 --> 26:30.821
On me, 20.

26:30.823 --> 26:31.822
- [Voiceover] Yes sir.

26:33.725 --> 26:35.693
- This is day one, recruit.

26:35.695 --> 26:37.695
The Marine Corps is
not for everyone.

26:37.697 --> 26:40.631
There's a reason why it's
called the few and the proud.

26:40.633 --> 26:41.899
Do you wanna be here?

26:41.901 --> 26:43.133
- Yes sir.

26:43.135 --> 26:44.068
- [Sergeant] I can't
hear you recruit,

26:44.070 --> 26:45.703
I said, do you wanna be here?

26:45.705 --> 26:47.805
- Yes sir, but I can't.

26:47.807 --> 26:49.039
- But what?

26:49.041 --> 26:51.742
Are you takin' a
goddamned nap right now?

26:53.178 --> 26:54.345
Are you a child?

26:54.347 --> 26:58.148
- You think next I'm gonna
bend over to wipe your ass?

26:58.150 --> 27:00.017
Oh I see what this is.

27:00.019 --> 27:02.686
You think this is breast
feeding time, don't you?

27:02.688 --> 27:04.154
You want your momma?

27:04.156 --> 27:07.658
She ain't here.
I'm your momma now.

27:07.660 --> 27:09.927
Is this some big
fuckin' joke to you?

27:09.929 --> 27:10.794
- No!

27:11.696 --> 27:13.797
- I know your father.

27:13.799 --> 27:16.867
What would he do if
he saw you right now?

27:16.869 --> 27:18.335
You think he'd be proud?

27:19.270 --> 27:20.004
Get up.

27:21.239 --> 27:22.339
Come on, get up!

27:25.944 --> 27:28.312
(crickets chirping)

27:31.783 --> 27:34.351
- I don't know, I was a little
nervous at first, but...

27:35.286 --> 27:37.221
In the heat of the moment,
all you guys yelling at me,

27:37.223 --> 27:38.789
it just kind of took me over.

27:40.058 --> 27:41.825
- [Voiceover] You
fought good, man.

27:41.827 --> 27:43.894
Got a lotta heart.

28:01.312 --> 28:02.746
- [Voiceover] I was
scared there for a minute,

28:02.748 --> 28:04.214
I thought Green
was gonna eat it.

28:04.216 --> 28:06.984
- Respect the process,
his name is Noah.

28:08.253 --> 28:11.755
- I thought that Noah was
gonna get his fuckin' ass beat

28:11.757 --> 28:13.190
by some little rich kid

28:13.192 --> 28:14.792
that looked like
he shit himself.

28:14.794 --> 28:16.260
- He didn't, though.

28:16.262 --> 28:17.795
- You didn't exactly blow
away the competition yourself,

28:17.797 --> 28:21.832
- The guy that they gave
me was six foot five.

28:21.834 --> 28:23.801
He was a fucking Goliath.

28:23.803 --> 28:25.135
- [Voiceover] Is that why
you kicked him in the balls?

28:26.805 --> 28:28.038
- You know what Denny?

28:29.040 --> 28:32.409
David used a slingshot
against Goliath.

28:32.411 --> 28:35.179
There's nothing wrong
with being resourceful.

28:35.181 --> 28:37.481
- David didn't kick
Goliath in the balls.

28:37.483 --> 28:39.483
- I seem to remember
that your guy

28:39.485 --> 28:42.286
looked like his fucking balls
dropped the week before.

28:42.288 --> 28:43.854
- Come on now, he
just looked young.

28:43.856 --> 28:45.756
- He looked like he was nine.

28:45.758 --> 28:47.458
He pissed himself!

28:47.460 --> 28:49.727
He was cryin' for his mommy.

28:49.729 --> 28:54.164
"No! No! No! No! Mom, mom!

28:54.166 --> 28:56.467
"I love you, no!"

28:56.469 --> 28:59.203
(fake cries)

28:59.205 --> 29:01.939
- That was great,
thanks for the memory.

29:01.941 --> 29:03.874
- Let's get the
next fight started.

29:05.744 --> 29:09.880
- Oh yeah, okay, yeah,
so I'm the asshole.

29:13.818 --> 29:18.288
- [Voiceover] Come on, let's go.

29:22.193 --> 29:23.460
- [Voiceover]
Alright, get pumped.

29:26.765 --> 29:27.965
(shouting)

29:27.967 --> 29:30.334
- [Voiceover] Let's
go sweet cheeks.

29:30.336 --> 29:33.070
(distant cheering)

29:33.072 --> 29:34.404
(clapping)

29:34.406 --> 29:35.773
- Come on baldy, get up.

29:36.975 --> 29:38.408
I'm not asking, move.

29:39.844 --> 29:42.179
Let's go Silver, come
on, come on brother.

29:42.181 --> 29:44.047
- Take him out.

29:44.049 --> 29:45.415
- [Voiceover] You're
gonna fuckin' kill him.

29:45.417 --> 29:46.216
- Let's go.

29:46.218 --> 29:47.217
- [Voiceover] Kill him!

29:47.219 --> 29:48.452
- [Voiceover] Heck yeah!

29:48.454 --> 29:50.287
- Come on, we're on
a tight schedule.

29:52.190 --> 29:54.324
- He's not ready. Let me go.

29:54.326 --> 29:55.392
- We're not changing the order,

29:58.196 --> 30:00.230
Or we're gonna shoot you in
the fuckin' face right now,

30:00.232 --> 30:00.898
it's up to you.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.332
- Get up.

30:06.171 --> 30:08.572
Come on, it's your
time to shine.

30:11.409 --> 30:12.509
- Fight!

30:16.915 --> 30:18.048
- I won't do it.

30:19.284 --> 30:21.385
I won't do it!

30:25.590 --> 30:35.833
(screams)

30:35.835 --> 30:45.943
(screams)

30:45.945 --> 30:57.621
(screams)

31:02.193 --> 31:03.193
- Winner!

31:03.195 --> 31:05.863
(clapping)

31:08.466 --> 31:09.399
- Well done.

31:11.569 --> 31:18.375
Let's go.

31:22.580 --> 31:23.947
- Welcome.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.950
(clapping)

31:28.620 --> 31:30.554
- Alright, let's go boys.

31:34.292 --> 31:35.559
- Can I talk to you?

31:37.061 --> 31:38.295
- No special treatment.

31:38.297 --> 31:40.664
- I just, I wanna talk
to you for a second.

31:40.666 --> 31:41.999
- What is it?

31:43.668 --> 31:45.168
- I guess this is
why you wanted me

31:45.170 --> 31:47.604
to take boxing classes
in high school, isn't it?

31:47.606 --> 31:50.540
- I wanted to make
sure you were prepared,

31:50.542 --> 31:51.541
and you are.

31:52.610 --> 31:54.578
Don't second guess yourself.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.346
Don't forget what
kind of opportunities

31:56.348 --> 31:57.581
this is gonna bring to you.

31:57.583 --> 31:59.182
- I just wanna know
how you live with this.

32:01.552 --> 32:03.420
- That's the question
you wanna ask me?

32:03.422 --> 32:05.055
- I'm not scared.

32:05.556 --> 32:08.292
I mean I'm not scared of the
fight, I know I can fight.

32:09.627 --> 32:12.496
But then I think about how
I'm gonna go to sleep tonight.

32:13.531 --> 32:17.534
And the next night, and some
night 10 years from now.

32:17.536 --> 32:20.103
- Did I not explain
to you the seriousness

32:20.105 --> 32:21.371
of this commitment?

32:21.373 --> 32:24.107
This is a conversation
you have with me

32:24.109 --> 32:26.610
the day you're trying
to join, not now.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.278
Did I not tell you...

32:29.213 --> 32:33.250
That you need to be
prepared to die and to kill

32:33.252 --> 32:34.651
to do this?

32:34.653 --> 32:36.520
- You're talking
about human beings.

32:36.522 --> 32:40.223
You know as well as I
do that it is different

32:40.225 --> 32:43.226
when there is a man
kneeling in front of you,

32:43.228 --> 32:45.062
screaming and begging.

32:45.064 --> 32:46.530
- It's no different.

32:46.532 --> 32:48.699
- Do you still think about him?

32:48.701 --> 32:49.499
The guy that you--

32:49.501 --> 32:50.100
- The guy that I killed?

32:50.102 --> 32:50.701
- Yeah.

32:51.736 --> 32:52.502
- Yes.

32:54.372 --> 32:57.274
A couple of months
ago, I meet this girl,

32:57.276 --> 33:01.378
I take her home,
and it's amazing.

33:01.380 --> 33:03.747
And afterwards she
goes to the kitchen

33:03.749 --> 33:06.683
and fills up a
glass of tap water.

33:06.685 --> 33:10.554
Comes back, sits on
the bed next to me,

33:10.556 --> 33:15.459
smiling, like we share some
kind of special secret.

33:17.228 --> 33:18.595
I lay back on the bed.

33:21.466 --> 33:22.666
I stare at the ceiling.

33:24.102 --> 33:25.202
And that...

33:28.740 --> 33:30.607
That's when I think of him.

33:31.542 --> 33:33.110
- So you regret it?

33:33.711 --> 33:34.778
- No.

33:36.581 --> 33:37.681
- Why?

33:37.683 --> 33:38.648
- You're my brother.

33:40.151 --> 33:41.685
My blood.

33:42.420 --> 33:45.188
But I trust any one of
these guys in this book...

33:46.624 --> 33:48.692
More than I trust you.

33:48.694 --> 33:52.329
This is a part of me now,
and it's a part of them.

33:55.666 --> 34:06.143
There's no going back.

34:10.281 --> 34:13.650
- I wonder who's gonna be next.

34:17.755 --> 34:19.656
I tried to kill myself once.

34:21.826 --> 34:24.594
It's almost sort of
funny with all...

34:25.663 --> 34:26.763
All this.

34:29.333 --> 34:30.600
I took pills.

34:32.437 --> 34:33.703
They say men...

34:34.605 --> 34:37.641
Usually do something
more violent, you know?

34:39.476 --> 34:42.679
Blow their brains out or
jump off a cliff or whatever.

34:45.248 --> 34:46.382
I took pills.

34:49.487 --> 34:50.454
I didn't know if I had enough,

34:50.456 --> 34:53.223
so I chugged it with some vodka.

34:54.559 --> 34:57.094
I woke up the next
morning with a migraine

34:57.096 --> 34:58.528
and a stomach ache.

35:00.231 --> 35:01.665
I couldn't even
kill myself right.

35:01.667 --> 35:02.666
- Enough.

35:03.634 --> 35:05.235
I'm not dying here tonight.

35:05.237 --> 35:07.604
- You really think they're
gonna let you go if you win?

35:08.706 --> 35:10.707
- Wasn't what I meant.

35:10.709 --> 35:16.246
You got anything that
can make a distraction?

35:20.651 --> 35:23.253
(phone ringing)

35:23.255 --> 35:24.121
- You guys ready?

35:25.423 --> 35:32.729
- Let's do it.

35:36.667 --> 35:38.635
- Did you notice? New lenses.

35:38.637 --> 35:40.504
- [Denny] Yeah, they're nice.

35:40.506 --> 35:44.207
- Alright, Eric
Whimms, come on down.

35:47.345 --> 35:48.178
(grunting)

35:49.147 --> 35:51.281
(shouting)

35:53.551 --> 35:54.684
Fuck!

35:57.555 --> 35:59.489
You're outnumbered and unarmed!

35:59.491 --> 36:02.626
How long you think
you're gonna last?

36:17.175 --> 36:18.175
- Stop.

36:18.643 --> 36:19.843
Did I order you to limp along

36:19.845 --> 36:21.611
like a wounded gazelle, recruit?

36:21.613 --> 36:22.679
- No.

36:22.681 --> 36:24.514
- No what?

36:24.516 --> 36:25.715
- Sir.

36:25.717 --> 36:27.584
- Now you put those
words together.

36:27.586 --> 36:28.652
I have a daughter two years old

36:28.654 --> 36:30.287
that can handle that concept.

36:32.390 --> 36:33.690
- No sir.

36:33.692 --> 36:35.325
- You've been behind
on every drill.

36:36.294 --> 36:46.937
Run, recruit.

36:50.808 --> 36:52.642
- Jesus Christ,
that fucker can run.

36:52.644 --> 36:54.644
- I don't know which
one of you two is worse!

36:54.646 --> 36:55.879
- He's the one who let
him out of the cage!

36:55.881 --> 36:57.681
- You stood there and watched!

36:57.683 --> 36:59.583
- Shut up! Shut up!

36:59.585 --> 37:01.751
Fan out, you two
with them, that way.

37:01.753 --> 37:04.821
Red and Orange, back
that way, you're with me.

37:21.672 --> 37:22.672
- We shouldn't have to do this.

37:22.674 --> 37:24.374
- Shh, keep it down.

37:24.376 --> 37:25.942
- This is ridiculous.

37:25.944 --> 37:27.644
- It's all part of it.

37:27.646 --> 37:29.346
- Fuck that.

37:29.348 --> 37:30.947
We're supposed to fight a
guy to the death tonight,

37:30.949 --> 37:32.816
we shouldn't have to
worry about this, too.

37:32.818 --> 37:33.850
This is not part of it.

37:33.852 --> 37:34.918
- He is one guy.

37:36.020 --> 37:37.821
Let's just get it over with.

37:37.823 --> 37:38.788
(glass shatters)

37:39.824 --> 37:41.024
Over there.

37:45.396 --> 37:48.932
(suspenseful music)

37:53.271 --> 37:54.304
- [Voiceover] See anything?

37:54.306 --> 37:55.438
- Shut up!

37:59.543 --> 38:00.710
(gun shot)
(grunt)

38:00.712 --> 38:02.012
(grunting)

38:03.714 --> 38:06.583
- Aw, fuck.

38:10.788 --> 38:12.722
(yelling)

38:16.861 --> 38:18.628
- I can fucking shoot you.

38:18.630 --> 38:19.696
- But you won't.

38:21.365 --> 38:22.966
- Aw, shit!

38:24.001 --> 38:25.802
(beeping)

38:27.705 --> 38:29.372
(phone rings)

38:29.374 --> 38:30.807
- Stop, stop, stop.

38:30.809 --> 38:31.875
Tell me what's going on.

38:31.877 --> 38:32.942
- We got him.

38:32.944 --> 38:34.344
- Thank Christ.

38:34.346 --> 38:35.578
- There's some bad news.

38:37.481 --> 38:38.715
He had a gun.

38:38.717 --> 38:40.483
- Where the fuck
did he get a gun?

38:40.485 --> 38:42.585
- I don't know, one of the cars.

38:42.587 --> 38:43.953
(grunting)

38:43.955 --> 38:46.623
He shot your brother.

39:01.672 --> 39:02.472
- Shit.

39:03.641 --> 39:04.641
Shit!

39:04.643 --> 39:05.608
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

39:05.610 --> 39:06.876
- Take him upstairs,

39:06.878 --> 39:08.912
get him cleaned up
and bandaged, now.

39:08.914 --> 39:10.080
Go!

39:10.082 --> 39:11.114
Hold him up.

39:13.751 --> 39:19.489
(grunting)

39:23.694 --> 39:26.763
(grunting)

39:26.765 --> 39:28.665
(gasping)

39:29.734 --> 39:32.902
- Throw him in the cell.

39:37.808 --> 39:40.577
- Damn, you must really
love that floor, homie.

39:42.413 --> 39:43.980
(grunting)

39:45.616 --> 39:46.649
- Is there an exit wound?

39:46.651 --> 39:47.717
- Yeah, in and out.

39:49.587 --> 39:50.854
We gotta get you
to the hospital.

39:53.591 --> 39:55.725
- Just step outside
for two minutes, guys.

39:55.727 --> 39:57.060
- Who's car am I
taking to the hospital?

39:57.062 --> 40:01.765
- Just step outside
for a minute.

40:05.970 --> 40:06.970
Don't leave yet.

40:07.972 --> 40:18.648
You're gonna be alright, bro.

40:22.520 --> 40:24.788
You got somethin' to
say to me, just say it.

40:24.790 --> 40:25.922
- It was already questionable

40:25.924 --> 40:27.557
bringing your brother
into the fold.

40:27.559 --> 40:29.426
- [Voiceover] He's never
been given special treatment.

40:29.428 --> 40:30.994
- [Denny] And you'll
agree we can't start now.

40:33.631 --> 40:35.165
- They're gonna make you fight.

40:35.167 --> 40:37.133
- Oh come on, there's no way.

40:37.135 --> 40:39.469
- What's taking them so long?

40:40.738 --> 40:42.772
- Guys, what the fuck
are you talkin' about?

40:44.742 --> 40:45.875
He got shot.

40:47.611 --> 40:50.613
- The rules are the
rules, no exceptions.

40:50.615 --> 40:51.781
I'm rescheduling.

40:53.083 --> 40:55.452
- Are you agreeing with this?

40:55.454 --> 40:56.486
- He's right.

40:57.922 --> 40:59.122
The fight goes on.

41:00.458 --> 41:01.958
Give me a couple
minutes alone with him.

41:02.993 --> 41:04.461
- They can't do that.

41:07.064 --> 41:08.665
- Who else knows you're here?

41:09.867 --> 41:10.834
- No one.

41:12.069 --> 41:14.137
Why?

41:28.919 --> 41:30.153
So what now?

41:31.790 --> 41:35.592
- Kind of like I just
got fuckin' shot.

41:35.594 --> 41:36.793
- You think you can fight?

41:37.728 --> 41:38.795
- Are you kidding?

41:39.797 --> 41:41.231
Screw that.

41:41.233 --> 41:43.132
I'll wait 'till next year.

41:43.134 --> 41:45.168
- It's not that simple.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.604
You only get one shot
at your final challenge.

41:48.639 --> 41:50.874
It's an unfair
situation, I know.

41:50.876 --> 41:52.575
- I can't fight.

41:54.678 --> 41:56.679
- The guy you're goin'
against is nothin'.

41:56.681 --> 41:58.681
He's probably never even
been in a real fight before.

41:59.917 --> 42:00.917
- I got some pills--

42:00.919 --> 42:02.719
- Are you listening to me?

42:03.621 --> 42:05.555
I'm not doin' it.

42:05.557 --> 42:08.691
If that means I can't
get initiated, so be it.

42:11.762 --> 42:13.129
- Thing is...

42:13.131 --> 42:18.801
You swore in under the code
to take your final challenge.

42:20.104 --> 42:21.571
- So what?

42:22.039 --> 42:24.574
- So you have to
go through with it.

42:24.576 --> 42:25.608
- And if I don't?

42:27.912 --> 42:29.112
You gonna kill me?

42:30.748 --> 42:32.682
- This is how it is.

42:32.684 --> 42:35.652
These are rules,
not suggestions.

42:35.654 --> 42:37.287
If you don't go
through with this...

42:40.190 --> 42:41.858
I can't protect you.

42:43.227 --> 42:44.127
- So you just...

42:45.162 --> 42:46.596
You let me leave.

42:47.665 --> 42:53.069
You tell them you don't
know where I went.

42:57.341 --> 42:59.208
- I can't do that.

42:59.210 --> 43:01.044
- This is insane!

43:01.046 --> 43:04.581
I can barely lift my
arm, I cannot fight.

43:06.083 --> 43:08.184
- Listen, listen,
listen, listen.

43:09.820 --> 43:10.887
I am your brother.

43:12.122 --> 43:13.756
I am your actual brother.

43:15.793 --> 43:17.827
Does that not mean
anything to you?

43:18.662 --> 43:21.064
- This is bigger
than you and me.

43:21.066 --> 43:23.333
You need to accept
that this is happening,

43:23.335 --> 43:26.002
and focus on getting
through this.

43:55.766 --> 43:59.636
- They really are crazy.

44:03.273 --> 44:05.375
They gon' make him fight
with that shoulder.

44:06.310 --> 44:08.011
- Couldn't shoot
him in the head?

44:09.214 --> 44:13.349
You take that shoulder out,
and this fight is over.

44:13.351 --> 44:14.717
You got this.

44:16.654 --> 44:17.887
- [Denny] Alright Eric.

44:19.723 --> 44:20.923
- Circle it up.

44:24.762 --> 44:26.062
You can do this.

44:26.064 --> 44:27.830
- You got this, Red.

44:30.668 --> 44:40.977
- Get the fuck away from me,
every single fucking one.

44:45.683 --> 44:46.783
- Fight.

44:48.318 --> 44:50.787
- Left shoulder, focus
on that shoulder, Eric.

44:50.789 --> 44:52.722
- Work that motherfucker!

44:52.724 --> 44:53.756
- [Simon] Left shoulder.

44:56.026 --> 44:56.926
Shoulder Eric!

44:56.928 --> 44:57.860
- [Simon] Let's go!

44:57.862 --> 44:58.928
- Left shoulder! Let's go!

44:58.930 --> 44:59.862
He's weak!

44:59.864 --> 45:02.231
(shouting)

45:05.069 --> 45:06.836
(grunting)

45:10.040 --> 45:12.275
- There you go, swing
at that motherfucker!

45:12.277 --> 45:14.243
Get him, Eric, get him!

45:15.245 --> 45:16.946
Focus on the shoulder, man!

45:18.148 --> 45:19.449
Come back strong on it!

45:20.818 --> 45:22.118
Come on man!

45:23.721 --> 45:25.988
(grunting)

45:29.493 --> 45:32.261
(grunting)

45:36.467 --> 45:38.835
- That's enough!

45:38.837 --> 45:41.170
- You step in, you
ruin the whole process!

45:42.806 --> 45:44.073
- Yeah!

45:44.075 --> 45:45.742
Atta boy, pound him,
pound him, let's go!

45:47.144 --> 45:50.446
(shouting)

45:54.852 --> 45:57.086
(yelling)

45:59.223 --> 46:01.124
- [Voiceover] Move! Move!

46:03.127 --> 46:06.062
(shouting)
(grunting)

46:08.332 --> 46:10.333
- [Voiceover] There you
go! There you go Eric!

46:10.335 --> 46:11.801
You got this shit! You got this!

46:13.470 --> 46:15.972
(shouting)

46:20.244 --> 46:21.310
- [Voiceover] Hit him!

46:21.312 --> 46:22.812
- [Voiceover] Get up!

46:22.814 --> 46:24.547
Move on him, move on him!

46:27.417 --> 46:29.118
Swing! Swing!

46:29.120 --> 46:30.219
- Come on.

46:30.221 --> 46:32.288
(grunting)

46:36.493 --> 46:37.527
- There you go!

46:37.529 --> 46:38.461
Burn that Motherfucker!

46:38.463 --> 46:40.329
- Yeah, come on Eric!

46:41.965 --> 46:44.333
(grunting)

46:44.335 --> 46:54.343
- No!

46:58.515 --> 46:59.849
- Winner.

47:00.884 --> 47:01.984
Free to go.

47:03.253 --> 47:05.054
- [Voiceover] I did this to you.

47:07.991 --> 47:09.392
- There's no way.

47:13.230 --> 47:16.833
- I'll make sure he
gets to his car safe.

47:20.571 --> 47:22.271
- Rest of you go up stairs,

47:22.273 --> 47:32.248
get ready for the next round.

47:36.486 --> 47:41.457
Why don't you carry him?

47:45.596 --> 47:47.563
- Tear gas will not kill you.

47:49.533 --> 47:51.500
But it will feel like
death warmed over.

47:51.502 --> 47:56.205
Keep it movin', do
not stop movin'.

47:56.207 --> 47:59.642
Breathe lightly, do not
suck up a lot of oxygen.

47:59.644 --> 48:02.245
Keep your feet moving.

48:02.247 --> 48:05.348
You'll feel pain of an
intensity you've never known.

48:05.350 --> 48:07.583
You won't be able to see shit.

48:07.585 --> 48:09.218
You'll cough your damn lungs up,

48:09.220 --> 48:12.588
'cause it'll feel like
you in hell in hell fire.

48:13.657 --> 48:15.324
Keep your feet moving!

48:15.326 --> 48:16.993
(coughing)

48:16.995 --> 48:18.561
Take your rest and
let's keep moving.

48:20.063 --> 48:22.365
Take your rest and
let's keep moving.

48:22.367 --> 48:25.201
Whatever you do,
do not stop moving.

48:25.203 --> 48:27.336
You'll cough your lungs out.

48:27.338 --> 48:29.672
Keep your breathing easy.

48:29.674 --> 48:31.908
Pick yourself up, recruit.

48:31.910 --> 48:34.010
Do not leave him behind.

48:34.012 --> 48:36.646
Do not leave him behind.

48:36.648 --> 48:39.048
But no matter how
terrible it's gonna feel,

48:39.050 --> 48:40.583
remember you can
move through it,

48:40.585 --> 48:42.685
because you don't feel pain,

48:42.687 --> 48:46.656
you don't feel fatigue,
you don't believe in it.

48:46.658 --> 48:48.257
Get him out of here! Right now!

48:48.259 --> 48:50.192
You get that fuckin'
man outta here,

48:50.194 --> 48:51.961
if it's the last thing you do!

48:53.096 --> 48:55.231
Think about why I'm
makin' you do this.

48:55.233 --> 48:57.099
Think about what that
man on your shoulders

48:57.101 --> 48:58.501
represents to you.

48:58.503 --> 49:01.170
This is who we are!

49:02.339 --> 49:04.206
Do not quit on him!

49:05.208 --> 49:06.509
Keep it moving!

49:06.511 --> 49:07.977
- [Voiceover] Maybe
he made it out.

49:09.046 --> 49:10.479
- You really think that?

49:11.615 --> 49:12.715
- No.

49:12.717 --> 49:15.651
on his own two feet.

49:17.220 --> 49:19.188
I didn't think he had
that much fight in him.

49:19.190 --> 49:22.258
- I don't think he
thought he had it in him.

49:37.240 --> 49:43.746
- We can't keep him up here.

49:48.085 --> 49:50.152
We'll just move him later.

50:06.436 --> 50:09.238
- Have you ever killed anybody?

50:13.543 --> 50:14.744
- No.

50:17.180 --> 50:23.652
- Me either.

50:27.591 --> 50:29.358
How long you been with...

50:31.061 --> 50:33.029
Whatever crew you roll with?

50:35.198 --> 50:36.599
- Years now.

50:37.667 --> 50:40.669
Less than 10, more than seven.

50:41.705 --> 50:43.406
Shit gets fuzzy.

50:44.674 --> 50:48.110
Where I'm from, even
if you ain't with 'em?

50:49.513 --> 50:51.380
Still feels like you are.

50:56.119 --> 50:59.188
Was one of the first black
marines to serve in combat.

51:00.524 --> 51:03.626
Pops fought in Vietnam
in the first gulf war.

51:05.062 --> 51:08.097
Been an honorary Marine ever
since I came out the womb.

51:10.400 --> 51:11.734
- But you not a Marine?

51:15.705 --> 51:16.672
- Nah.

51:24.114 --> 51:26.816
- I was an assistant
manager at a grocery store.

51:26.818 --> 51:28.250
(chuckles)

51:32.589 --> 51:33.823
- Damn.

51:33.825 --> 51:35.524
- This will be your
first night time out.

51:35.526 --> 51:36.859
You will be responsible
for locating the position

51:36.861 --> 51:38.561
on the map and
finding some intel

51:38.563 --> 51:40.496
that is hidden at that position.

51:40.498 --> 51:42.665
Once you've recovered the intel,

51:42.667 --> 51:45.334
and retrace your steps
back to the position

51:45.336 --> 51:47.336
that we're standing
in right now.

51:47.338 --> 51:48.838
You are disarmed,

51:48.840 --> 51:51.273
you have lost your
night vision capability.

51:51.275 --> 51:53.442
Stealth is your primary concern

51:53.444 --> 51:55.644
so you don't get
your ass killed.

51:55.646 --> 51:59.582
We'll be completing this task
with no lights of any kind.

51:59.584 --> 52:01.350
Anyone who illuminates
a flash light

52:01.352 --> 52:02.618
will fail the course.

52:04.221 --> 52:06.422
You have not slept
within the last 72 hours,

52:06.424 --> 52:07.723
and you have barely eaten.

52:07.725 --> 52:09.125
I do not care.

52:09.127 --> 52:11.794
I do not care because
the enemy will not care.

52:11.796 --> 52:14.296
He will find you if you
pass out underneath a bush,

52:14.298 --> 52:16.565
or if you're too goddamned
stupid to navigate properly,

52:16.567 --> 52:18.534
and rolled into his position.

52:18.536 --> 52:20.536
If you do either of
those two things,

52:20.538 --> 52:22.805
you will fail the course.

52:22.807 --> 52:25.674
I will be monitoring
your progress.

52:25.676 --> 52:28.744
will earn a half
hour break and one...

52:31.815 --> 52:33.549
Genuine chocolate bar.

52:37.487 --> 52:47.530
(high pitched hum)

52:47.532 --> 52:57.640
(high pitched hum)

52:57.642 --> 53:02.878
(high pitched hum)

53:07.584 --> 53:17.626
(gasps)

53:17.628 --> 53:26.602
(gasps)

53:30.740 --> 53:32.508
- Just go away, just go away.

53:32.510 --> 53:34.276
- You can't sleep
man, wake the fuck up.

53:34.278 --> 53:35.377
- You gonna draw
attention to me,

53:35.379 --> 53:36.545
just get outta here.

53:36.547 --> 53:37.713
- I can't do that.

53:37.715 --> 53:38.747
- Just get outta here.

53:38.749 --> 53:39.715
Give me five minutes--

53:39.717 --> 53:41.317
- Wake the fuck up.

53:41.319 --> 53:42.718
- This is not a team mission,
Denton, just fuckin'--

53:42.720 --> 53:44.653
- We're the fuckin' Marines.

53:44.655 --> 53:46.455
- We're not Marines yet.

53:46.457 --> 53:47.823
- Yeah, well you
damn sure won't be

53:47.825 --> 53:49.625
if sergeant Raynor finds
you sleeping here, man,

53:49.627 --> 53:50.693
now let's go.

53:51.695 --> 53:52.628
Wake the fuck up!

53:56.733 --> 53:58.467
- Next time I sleep?

53:58.469 --> 54:00.569
I'ma dream about killing you.

54:00.571 --> 54:02.638
- Walk.

54:59.496 --> 55:01.563
Where are the others, sir?

55:14.744 --> 55:16.378
- [Voiceover] Let's go, big boy.

55:17.414 --> 55:18.080
- That's me.

55:19.716 --> 55:20.582
- Hey.

55:21.651 --> 55:22.818
Never got your name.

55:24.587 --> 55:25.921
- Wayne.

55:30.527 --> 55:32.461
- Take him out.

55:32.463 --> 55:37.800
- If I drop these bitches,
first round is on me.

55:42.539 --> 55:43.339
- Fight!

55:43.341 --> 55:44.373
- Come on white boy.

55:44.375 --> 55:45.541
(mumbles)

55:45.543 --> 55:46.709
Come on, don't stop, don't stop.

55:46.711 --> 55:47.943
You scared bitch?

55:50.080 --> 55:53.649
(grunting)

55:57.921 --> 55:59.421
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

56:00.457 --> 56:02.057
- [All] Yeah!

56:02.059 --> 56:03.525
- [Voiceover] Yeah Orange!

56:03.527 --> 56:05.594
(grunting)

56:06.629 --> 56:07.896
- Get some!

56:07.898 --> 56:08.764
- Get up!

56:11.401 --> 56:13.135
- Come on! Come on!

56:16.740 --> 56:18.006
Aw man!

56:19.809 --> 56:21.977
Come on now.

56:21.979 --> 56:24.079
(cheering)

56:26.683 --> 56:28.817
(grunting)

56:31.888 --> 56:34.056
- Get up. Get up, Wayne.

56:34.058 --> 56:35.424
- [Voiceover] Fuck yeah.

56:36.426 --> 56:38.160
Kill him, kill him, kill, kill!

56:40.764 --> 56:42.164
(grunting)

56:44.667 --> 56:47.169
(yelling)

56:50.907 --> 56:52.775
(screams)

56:54.677 --> 56:57.846
(cheering)

56:59.983 --> 57:04.186
(yelling)

57:08.658 --> 57:10.526
- [Voiceover] Yeah!

57:13.129 --> 57:15.697
(cheering)

57:15.699 --> 57:29.678
(clapping)

57:33.817 --> 57:35.751
- You killed my brother tonight.

57:36.686 --> 57:37.953
- That was your brother?

57:37.955 --> 57:39.822
(chuckles)

57:39.824 --> 57:42.057
Best news I heard all night.

57:42.059 --> 57:44.827
I shot him to defend myself.

57:44.829 --> 57:46.562
You ignorant fuck.

57:46.564 --> 57:47.729
- A lotta good it did you.

57:47.731 --> 57:49.565
- What are you
gonna tell your mom?

57:49.567 --> 57:50.966
"I got little Johnny killed?"

57:52.635 --> 57:54.803
- This is gonna be your
last hour in this world.

57:54.805 --> 57:56.772
- Livin' longer
than your brother.

57:56.774 --> 57:58.040
He's gone.

57:58.042 --> 58:00.776
Kill me, kill whoever,
he's not comin' back.

58:00.778 --> 58:02.211
Live with that.

58:02.213 --> 58:03.979
- All I'm worried about is
what's gonna happen to you

58:03.981 --> 58:05.681
in the next hour.

58:05.683 --> 58:07.783
See your fuckin' head
smashed against the ground.

58:08.751 --> 58:10.752
That'll make me feel a
hell of a lot better.

58:10.754 --> 58:12.754
- How about you come see me now?

58:12.756 --> 58:14.189
Nobody in here, come see me now.

58:14.191 --> 58:15.724
- Wouldn't even be a fight.

58:15.726 --> 58:16.725
- Scared.

58:16.727 --> 58:19.027
- Scared of dyin' just
like your brother.

58:19.029 --> 58:20.062
- Scared of you motherfucker?

58:20.064 --> 58:21.196
Goddamn!

58:23.566 --> 58:24.800
Fuck!

58:25.502 --> 58:28.637
You're gonna fuckin'
die! Tonight!

58:28.639 --> 58:29.571
- [Simon] Not gonna
bring him back.

58:29.573 --> 58:30.739
- You're gonna fuckin' die!

58:30.741 --> 58:32.007
- Not gonna bring him back,

58:32.009 --> 58:33.175
you're gonna have to die
with that, motherfucker.

58:33.177 --> 58:35.978
You got your bother
killed! You did!

58:38.047 --> 58:39.781
I can sleep at night.

58:43.119 --> 58:45.754
(door slams)

58:49.792 --> 58:52.127
- Congratulations on
a successful mission.

58:52.129 --> 58:54.696
You all know what's coming next.

58:54.698 --> 58:57.766
Pace yourselves,
there's only one rule.

58:58.902 --> 59:00.235
Don't stop movin'.

59:02.038 --> 59:03.772
If any man cannot
complete my march,

59:03.774 --> 59:06.174
you will fail out
of my Marine Corps.

59:06.176 --> 59:08.176
Recruit Denton was
the first man back,

59:08.178 --> 59:10.078
and has earned
himself a reprieve.

59:10.080 --> 59:12.648
Recruit Denton, walk
to the road we took in.

59:12.650 --> 59:14.750
another staffed
sergeant will meet you.

59:14.752 --> 59:16.985
You will join us on the
march after your break.

59:16.987 --> 59:19.054
- Sir, I'd like to stay.

59:32.769 --> 59:33.869
- You're an idiot.

59:35.171 --> 59:37.105
- Go fuck yourself.

59:37.107 --> 59:42.711
- I don't have the energy.

59:46.783 --> 59:48.083
- Why is it every other
man in this company

59:48.085 --> 59:49.284
is ahead of you, Evans?

59:50.219 --> 59:51.253
- I can't.

59:51.255 --> 59:55.090
Do not dirty my Marine Corps
with that word, recruit.

59:56.059 --> 59:57.359
- I just need another minute.

59:57.361 --> 01:00:00.128
- There will come a time
when you in the field,

01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:02.598
and your fellow soldiers
lives will depend on you.

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:04.900
You might be tired,
you might be hungry,

01:00:04.902 --> 01:00:07.135
you might wanna
take a shit and nap

01:00:07.137 --> 01:00:08.804
and fuck Suzy Q.

01:00:08.806 --> 01:00:10.238
Are you gonna tell 'em
you just needed a minute?

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:11.773
- No, no.

01:00:11.775 --> 01:00:13.675
- We're one mile
into a 20 mile march,

01:00:13.677 --> 01:00:15.744
and there's no rest comin'
for you any time soon.

01:00:15.746 --> 01:00:18.113
I suggest you start
marchin', or quit!

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:20.649
- Yes sir.

01:00:20.651 --> 01:00:22.718
Yes sir.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:50.912
(weak groans)

01:00:55.318 --> 01:01:03.892
(coughing)

01:01:08.164 --> 01:01:09.865
- [Voiceover] Welcome.

01:01:09.867 --> 01:01:12.668
(clapping)

01:01:15.071 --> 01:01:25.113
(suspenseful music)

01:01:25.115 --> 01:01:31.853
(suspenseful music)

01:01:35.425 --> 01:01:36.725
- [Voiceover] You
wanted to see me?

01:01:37.927 --> 01:01:39.294
- What happened earlier...

01:01:41.731 --> 01:01:43.398
That can't happen again.

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:48.070
Especially with the
guy you're fighting.

01:01:48.072 --> 01:01:49.071
- It won't.

01:01:49.073 --> 01:01:50.072
- He's trained.

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:52.774
He'll know what he's doing.

01:01:53.776 --> 01:01:54.776
- [Voiceover] So do I.

01:01:55.778 --> 01:01:57.012
It won't be a problem.

01:01:57.014 --> 01:01:58.313
- Hey!

01:01:58.315 --> 01:02:01.750
I don't give a fuck how
tough you think you are.

01:02:02.752 --> 01:02:04.352
You underestimate him?

01:02:04.354 --> 01:02:06.722
It'll be your body we're
draggin' to the woods.

01:02:07.757 --> 01:02:08.990
You understand?

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:11.727
- Yes sir.

01:02:14.263 --> 01:02:18.366
- Good.

01:02:22.839 --> 01:02:37.252
(suspenseful music)

01:02:41.858 --> 01:02:50.899
(screaming)

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:56.772
- Every single one of
you is physically capable

01:02:56.774 --> 01:02:57.939
of doing this.

01:02:57.941 --> 01:03:00.408
Every single one.

01:03:01.811 --> 01:03:02.544
But before we finish tonight,

01:03:02.546 --> 01:03:04.880
I know some of you will quit.

01:03:04.882 --> 01:03:07.149
Happens every single time.

01:03:07.151 --> 01:03:11.353
Just ask yourself,
is that person you?

01:03:15.558 --> 01:03:17.058
- You ready?

01:03:18.394 --> 01:03:19.494
- [Voiceover] Hit
me in the face.

01:03:19.496 --> 01:03:21.062
- Come on out, that's it.

01:03:23.399 --> 01:03:24.800
(screams)

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:28.537
- [Sergeant] Full
speed, execute!

01:03:28.539 --> 01:03:30.438
(screaming)

01:03:32.542 --> 01:03:33.575
- [Voiceover] Push him!

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:37.012
(grunting)

01:03:37.014 --> 01:03:38.847
- [Voiceover] Weak! Weak!

01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:41.850
(laughing)

01:03:44.253 --> 01:03:45.387
- Get back on him.

01:03:46.989 --> 01:03:48.857
(grunting)

01:03:49.959 --> 01:03:51.827
(laughing)

01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:54.830
(screaming)

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.600
- [Voiceover]
Alright, get on him.

01:03:58.602 --> 01:04:00.936
- Think of all you've suffered.

01:04:00.938 --> 01:04:05.841
All the pain, the
sweat, and mud.

01:04:05.843 --> 01:04:08.543
Just another 15 miles
and it'll all be over.

01:04:08.545 --> 01:04:10.111
So march.

01:04:11.914 --> 01:04:13.281
- [Voiceover] Finish him.

01:04:13.283 --> 01:04:16.184
(grunting)

01:04:16.186 --> 01:04:17.219
- [Voiceover] Come on.

01:04:18.187 --> 01:04:19.154
- [Voiceover] Get up!

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:21.456
- Get up!

01:04:25.494 --> 01:04:28.396
(grunting)

01:04:28.398 --> 01:04:29.965
(screaming)

01:04:34.337 --> 01:04:36.304
(screaming)

01:04:36.306 --> 01:04:37.372
- Man, that's cheap,

01:04:37.374 --> 01:04:39.307
you don't kick a
man in the nuts!

01:04:41.344 --> 01:04:44.179
(disgruntled grunts)

01:04:44.181 --> 01:04:45.614
- [Voiceover] Please, kill him!

01:04:48.551 --> 01:04:50.518
(screaming)

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:52.254
(shoulder dislocates)
(screams)

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:56.258
- [Voiceover] Get
off the ground.

01:04:56.260 --> 01:04:57.492
You have to keep fighting.

01:04:57.494 --> 01:04:59.928
- Oh come on, really?

01:04:59.930 --> 01:05:02.497
(grunting)

01:05:02.499 --> 01:05:08.136
(slow motion whir)

01:05:12.541 --> 01:05:20.615
(screams)

01:05:25.087 --> 01:05:26.688
- Got a lot of rules.

01:05:27.657 --> 01:05:32.294
See how much you believe in 'em.

01:05:36.399 --> 01:05:37.632
- [Voiceover] Grab your brother.

01:05:39.402 --> 01:05:40.702
Carry him outta here.

01:05:41.671 --> 01:05:43.471
- I want my car keys.

01:05:44.573 --> 01:05:46.074
- Doesn't work that way.

01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:48.610
We're gonna escort
you to your car.

01:05:48.612 --> 01:05:50.946
- I'm not movin'
till I get my keys.

01:05:52.548 --> 01:05:54.282
I'm walkin' outta
here on my own.

01:05:55.584 --> 01:05:57.652
If you let me go, what
difference does it make?

01:06:00.456 --> 01:06:02.624
Eric didn't walk
outta here, did he?

01:06:02.626 --> 01:06:04.392
- No, he walked outta here.

01:06:05.394 --> 01:06:06.962
He just didn't walk too far.

01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:09.397
- Put the gun away.

01:06:11.067 --> 01:06:12.968
- What?

01:06:17.006 --> 01:06:18.440
- Do I get a knife too?

01:06:19.542 --> 01:06:21.276
- Let it go.

01:06:21.278 --> 01:06:22.610
Let's not complicate this.

01:06:22.612 --> 01:06:23.979
- Things are
already complicated.

01:06:23.981 --> 01:06:25.647
- You don't wanna
do this, come on.

01:06:25.649 --> 01:06:26.581
- Quiet.

01:06:28.551 --> 01:06:30.085
I wanna watch you....

01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:34.556
Scream for forgiveness.

01:06:35.725 --> 01:06:40.395
And then when you're flailing
around on the ground?

01:06:41.564 --> 01:06:43.365
Too tired to scream?

01:06:46.402 --> 01:06:48.236
I'm gonna cut your tongue out.

01:06:50.573 --> 01:06:53.074
And watch you choke on it.

01:06:57.446 --> 01:06:59.614
(grunting)

01:07:01.650 --> 01:07:03.418
(screaming)

01:07:05.755 --> 01:07:10.792
(high pitched hum)

01:07:15.531 --> 01:07:16.531
(grunt)

01:07:18.234 --> 01:07:19.801
(yells out)

01:07:21.437 --> 01:07:23.371
- I can't walk searge.

01:07:23.373 --> 01:07:24.572
- Remove your pack.

01:07:26.142 --> 01:07:27.342
And your boot.

01:07:29.111 --> 01:07:32.080
(screams)

01:07:36.185 --> 01:07:36.718
- Does this hurt?

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.386
(grunts)

01:07:38.388 --> 01:07:39.320
That means no.

01:07:39.322 --> 01:07:39.788
How about this?

01:07:39.790 --> 01:07:41.122
(grunts)

01:07:41.124 --> 01:07:42.323
How about that?

01:07:42.325 --> 01:07:43.391
- That!

01:07:44.527 --> 01:07:46.394
- It's not broken.

01:07:46.396 --> 01:07:47.796
It'll hurt worse than holy hell,

01:07:47.798 --> 01:07:49.798
but legally you can
complete the march.

01:07:51.167 --> 01:07:54.169
This is not a race, you
just have to finish.

01:07:54.171 --> 01:07:55.737
Don't stop movin'.

01:07:55.739 --> 01:07:59.607
(panting)

01:07:59.609 --> 01:08:00.508
(screams)

01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:03.078
(grunts)

01:08:07.483 --> 01:08:11.586

01:08:16.125 --> 01:08:17.859

01:08:21.529 --> 01:08:25.867
(grunts)

01:08:29.705 --> 01:08:32.607
- Only 12 miles to
go, you honey buns.

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:36.778
This looks like a
goddamned pleasant stroll.

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:38.379
Keep your feet moving.

01:08:39.648 --> 01:08:41.316
Come on, come on.

01:08:42.318 --> 01:08:44.252
On your feet, recruit.

01:08:44.254 --> 01:08:45.620
On your feet, recruit.

01:08:46.689 --> 01:08:49.756
On your goddamned feet, recruit!

01:08:49.759 --> 01:08:51.693
- I'm sorry, can't do it.

01:08:51.694 --> 01:08:54.529
- Evans, this is the
last goddamned time
I'm gonna tell you.

01:08:54.531 --> 01:09:04.706
Pick up that goddamned pack,
and you get up that hill!

01:09:08.877 --> 01:09:19.787
(grunting)

01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:27.761
(heavy breathing)

01:09:32.667 --> 01:09:34.935
You look at me, Denton,
I need you to stand up.

01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:36.938
What do you wanna do?

01:09:38.274 --> 01:09:38.872
Who do you wanna be?

01:09:38.875 --> 01:09:40.175
Think about your father.

01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:41.876
Think about your
father's father.

01:09:41.877 --> 01:09:44.479
Your name means
something out here.

01:09:44.481 --> 01:09:45.712
- [Voiceover] You're not
doin' it for your grandfather.

01:09:45.715 --> 01:09:48.515
- This is gonna be your
last hour in this--

01:09:48.518 --> 01:09:50.551
- [Sergeant] You're this close
to finishing this thing out.

01:09:50.554 --> 01:09:51.786
You wanna tell me after all,

01:09:51.787 --> 01:09:53.421
all you are is a piece of shit?

01:09:53.423 --> 01:09:54.355
- See your fuckin' head--

01:09:54.357 --> 01:09:55.590
- [Sergeant] Push people--

01:09:55.592 --> 01:09:56.925
- [Voiceover] Smashed
against the ground.

01:09:58.561 --> 01:10:00.628
- You can do one of
two things right now.

01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:03.531
Stand up and keep walking,
or you say you quit.

01:10:03.533 --> 01:10:04.532
- [Voiceover] You do it for you.

01:10:04.534 --> 01:10:07.202
- [Voiceover] You're
gonna fuckin' die!

01:10:07.204 --> 01:10:08.403
- You'll never be a man!

01:10:08.405 --> 01:10:09.604
Do you quit?

01:10:09.606 --> 01:10:11.506
Say if you do! Say it!

01:10:11.508 --> 01:10:12.740
(screams)

01:10:15.277 --> 01:10:16.477
- Marok?

01:10:16.479 --> 01:10:17.645
- Put it down.

01:10:17.647 --> 01:10:19.414
- Marok, let it go.

01:10:19.416 --> 01:10:20.215
- [Marok] Come on!

Come on!

01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:38.499

01:10:57.486 --> 01:11:01.522
- Oh, oh, okay you can
just walk out, man.

01:11:02.658 --> 01:11:03.825
- Give me the keys.

01:11:05.794 --> 01:11:11.532
(keys fall)

01:11:15.738 --> 01:11:22.510
Get in the cage.

01:11:26.849 --> 01:11:27.715
- Hey.

01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:30.685
Hey!

01:11:32.755 --> 01:11:34.856
You really think you're
gonna walk outta this alive?

01:11:37.359 --> 01:11:42.030
