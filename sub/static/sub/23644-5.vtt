WEBVTT

00:10.378 --> 00:13.678
It was causing wicked
hallucinations.

00:13.680 --> 00:17.750
My son -- I'm afraid he'll
be traumatized for life.

00:17.752 --> 00:21.954
He's trying to kill them.

00:21.956 --> 00:24.390
- He hits me.
- Yeah? Where does he hit you?

00:26.527 --> 00:28.193
Did you touch me?

00:29.363 --> 00:31.729
He pulled the trigger,
blew his head off.

00:32.900 --> 00:36.168
I'm thinking he killed himself.

00:36.170 --> 00:39.171
He's whispering, "You want
to kill everybody."

00:40.341 --> 00:42.875
Panic, panic, panic.

00:42.877 --> 00:44.777
My name is Amy Allan.

00:44.779 --> 00:46.611
I'm seeing, like, blood.

00:46.613 --> 00:49.915
The house just feels <i> bad.</i>

00:49.917 --> 00:51.183
I see dead people.

00:51.185 --> 00:55.554
This man
is <i> completely</i> insane.

00:55.556 --> 00:58.724
I speak to dead people...

00:58.726 --> 01:00.893
Whoo. Okay.
She doesn't like it in there.

01:00.895 --> 01:02.895
...and they speak to me.

01:02.897 --> 01:04.930
He likes to twist that knife.

01:04.932 --> 01:08.500
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

01:08.502 --> 01:12.170
Something paranormal
is trying to kill them.

01:12.172 --> 01:13.639
I rely on my partner.

01:13.641 --> 01:15.174
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:15.176 --> 01:17.509
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:17.511 --> 01:19.144
Now does he die right there,
on the spot?

01:19.146 --> 01:23.081
I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.717
I think it's trying
to steal my soul.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.553
It's my job to reveal them.

01:27.555 --> 01:29.855
You ever get touched
like that again?

01:29.857 --> 01:31.757
But Steve and I never speak...

01:31.759 --> 01:33.825
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:33.827 --> 01:35.160
...until the very end.

01:35.162 --> 01:37.329
I'm as stunned as you guys are.

01:37.331 --> 01:39.264
When we uncover if
it's safe for you to stay...

01:39.266 --> 01:41.900
I don't want anything
to happen to my daughter.

01:41.902 --> 01:43.335
Or time to get out.

01:43.337 --> 01:46.672
His goal
is to kill you guys.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.074

01:59.019 --> 02:00.819
I'm in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

02:00.821 --> 02:04.222
It's an old steel town about
an hour north of Philadelphia.

02:04.224 --> 02:06.258
I got a call from a single mom
named Nicole.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.793
Now she says the very day
she brought her son home

02:08.794 --> 02:12.497
from the hospital,
activity started going crazy.

02:12.499 --> 02:15.433
The boy is 3 now and getting
picked on every day,

02:15.435 --> 02:18.270
and she says if we can't help,
he's gonna get hurt.

02:24.511 --> 02:28.313
Before Amy arrives, I look
for any leading information.

02:28.315 --> 02:31.650
Photographs, paintings,
even children's art

02:31.652 --> 02:32.951
can influence her findings...

02:35.890 --> 02:38.924
so it's important that I cover
or remove them all.

02:38.926 --> 02:41.059
When I'm finished,
the location will be ready

02:41.061 --> 02:42.594
for tonight's walk.

02:51.739 --> 02:54.473
Yeah, this is not good.

02:54.475 --> 02:56.207
I hear yelling.

02:56.209 --> 02:59.678
People are dealing
with bad stuff.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.914
They're freaking out
and cryin' and screamin'.

03:04.251 --> 03:06.618
Feel, like, panic,
lots of panic, panic,

03:06.620 --> 03:08.086
like I'm gonna pass out.

03:08.088 --> 03:09.855
It's like, "Aah!"

03:19.400 --> 03:20.698
Well, Nicole,
I'm glad I'm here

03:20.700 --> 03:21.967
'cause after talking
to you on the phone,

03:21.969 --> 03:23.335
it sounds like you're
going through hell.

03:23.337 --> 03:26.805
- What's going on?
- Our life here is a daily hell.

03:26.807 --> 03:29.308
My son is having
such horrible experiences

03:29.310 --> 03:32.878
that I'm really worried
for his safety.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.447
Let's back it up a second.
Who exactly lives in the house?

03:35.449 --> 03:38.683
Okay.
Well, it's me and my son.

03:38.685 --> 03:40.752
August -- he's 3 years old.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.954
- Okay.
- This is my friend, Patty.

03:42.956 --> 03:46.058
She moved in a couple months ago
with her daughter, Haley.

03:46.060 --> 03:48.260
It's just temporary.
They're moving out soon.

03:48.262 --> 03:50.262
Are they moving out because
of what's going on here?

03:50.264 --> 03:54.299
Yes. They really didn't believe
until they experienced it.

03:54.301 --> 03:55.900
How long have you been
in this house?

03:55.902 --> 03:57.535
I bought the house
5 years ago.

03:57.537 --> 04:00.105
So did you notice activity
soon as you moved in?

04:00.107 --> 04:04.542
No. I only noticed it
after August was born.

04:04.544 --> 04:06.011
Okay. Do me a favor.

04:06.013 --> 04:08.079
Give me an idea of what
you guys are experiencing

04:08.081 --> 04:09.214
on a daily basis.

04:09.216 --> 04:11.617
Well, we feel like
we're being watched.

04:11.619 --> 04:13.919
We hear voices.

04:13.921 --> 04:17.822
And objects will move
on their own.

04:17.824 --> 04:20.158
We all see shadow figures

04:20.160 --> 04:23.628
and we get
physically touched.

04:23.630 --> 04:25.564
Now I know you said
it's picking on your son.

04:25.566 --> 04:27.632
How exactly is it
affecting August?

04:27.634 --> 04:31.436
He is constantly seeing
a man with a mustache.

04:31.438 --> 04:34.839
This thing can transform itself
to be almost anything,

04:34.841 --> 04:38.110
and he says that this entity
punches him in the face,

04:38.112 --> 04:40.579
goes into his head.

04:40.581 --> 04:43.581
You sure this is not just him
being a 3-year-old,

04:43.583 --> 04:44.883
acting out?

04:44.885 --> 04:47.585
He behaves in a way that
I know is not my son.

04:47.587 --> 04:49.254
His eyes will get black.

04:49.256 --> 04:52.491
He will do something violent,
like punch me, hit me, choke me.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.325
He becomes very disoriented.

04:54.327 --> 04:56.961
He'll have no memory
of what just happened.

04:56.963 --> 05:00.331
I'm afraid he'll be
traumatized for life.

05:00.333 --> 05:01.533
And how you dealing
with all of it?

05:01.535 --> 05:04.469
It's my number one stressor
in life, is this.

05:04.471 --> 05:07.205
Sometimes, I think it's...
could make me crazy,

05:07.207 --> 05:10.075
but I'm going
to stop at nothing

05:10.077 --> 05:12.611
to protect my son.
- Okay.

05:16.015 --> 05:19.818
So when I was opening,
I encountered

05:19.820 --> 05:21.753
a...a male,

05:21.755 --> 05:23.889
who's with me here right now.

05:25.425 --> 05:29.327
And he comes in
and he's upset about the living.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.963
He's extremely calculating
with the living.

05:31.965 --> 05:35.233
He likes games.

05:35.235 --> 05:36.635
They're also getting confused,

05:36.637 --> 05:39.771
feeling like they have
early onset Alzheimer's.

05:39.773 --> 05:42.240
Something mentally
is wrong with them,

05:42.242 --> 05:45.076
and that's him, that, you know
... their minds.

05:45.078 --> 05:49.247
What makes him happy
is thinking about killing,

05:49.249 --> 05:51.516
and I got specifically family.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.060
Okay, Nicole, so what's
going on in this room?

06:02.062 --> 06:03.595
When I'm downstairs here,

06:03.597 --> 06:06.064
it sounds like there are
knocking noises

06:06.066 --> 06:07.732
coming from the basement.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.169
Could it be pipes knocking?

06:11.171 --> 06:12.603
No.

06:12.605 --> 06:14.739
This happened at a time when
the heating system was not on,

06:14.741 --> 06:16.808
and neither was
the central air.

06:16.810 --> 06:19.177
Okay. Have you experienced
anything else?

06:19.179 --> 06:21.513
I see these shadowy figures
going down the hallway

06:21.515 --> 06:23.948
all the time.

06:23.950 --> 06:25.484
What's that shadow figure
look like to you?

06:25.486 --> 06:28.320
It's very misty.
It's not solid.

06:28.322 --> 06:29.254
Sometimes it's one

06:29.256 --> 06:31.189
and sometimes it's, like,
a cluster.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.424
Would you consider it
to be of human shape?

06:33.426 --> 06:36.661
I can't make it out
to be a human.

06:36.663 --> 06:38.062
Okay.
Anything else down here?

06:38.064 --> 06:40.832
I have this collectible
fire truck here.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.301
It will just fly off
for no reason.

06:43.303 --> 06:45.570
Now I know you have cats.
Could they have knocked it over?

06:45.572 --> 06:48.340
No. My cats don't even like
to be in this room.

06:48.342 --> 06:49.841
Okay.

06:52.111 --> 06:55.780
I think the dude
would hang out down here.

06:55.782 --> 06:58.449
He might get a little physical
with people down here

06:58.451 --> 07:02.854
being down here,
because this is his place.

07:02.856 --> 07:05.657
It's more of a feeling
like he goes through your body,

07:05.659 --> 07:06.992
and you feel it.

07:06.994 --> 07:10.929
He's causing
wicked hallucinations.

07:10.931 --> 07:15.333
He basically reads their minds
and then projects out

07:15.335 --> 07:18.369
what they think of as a ghost,

07:18.371 --> 07:20.004
so he tries
to freak them out, too.

07:20.006 --> 07:21.539
You know what I'm saying?

07:21.541 --> 07:23.675
"I can make them think they're
hearing sounds down here.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.710
"I can make them think
they're seeing

07:25.712 --> 07:27.379
this, that,
or the other thing."

07:27.381 --> 07:28.947
Like, he goes,
"I put it in their mind.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.649
They see what they want to see."

07:30.651 --> 07:31.883
What kind of threat
do you think

07:31.885 --> 07:33.551
this guy might pose
to the living?

07:33.553 --> 07:36.221
He's a...sexual predator.

07:36.223 --> 07:38.389
I think it's a possibility,
and I hope not,

07:38.391 --> 07:39.591
that he's perving out on them

07:39.593 --> 07:42.560
while they're sleeping
in their beds.

07:42.562 --> 07:45.030
They're feeling, like,
uncomfortable in the bathroom,

07:45.032 --> 07:46.665
feeling sexually violated.

07:54.974 --> 07:56.641
So, Nicole, I assume
this is your bedroom.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.776
- Yes.
- So what's going on up here?

07:58.778 --> 08:00.278
The bathroom, you know,

08:00.280 --> 08:02.847
I constantly feel like
I'm being watched.

08:02.849 --> 08:06.484
I took a shower, and I just
immediately felt this coldness

08:06.486 --> 08:08.253
and somebody behind me.

08:08.255 --> 08:11.789
It felt very creepy, almost as
if the person felt entitled

08:11.791 --> 08:17.161
to be there,
very perverted feeling.

08:17.163 --> 08:19.130
Anything else going on
in this room?

08:19.132 --> 08:22.133
I was pushed on my hips
a few times.

08:22.135 --> 08:25.069
Do you get the sense
if it's a male or a female?

08:25.071 --> 08:29.340
I always imagined there was
a masculine presence here.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.343
- Okay.
- Hi, Mommy.

08:31.345 --> 08:33.878
Hi, Auggy. Come here.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.347
- Hi.
- One, two, three.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.482
Okay. Mommy was telling me
about all the stuff

08:38.484 --> 08:39.650
that's going on
in this place.

08:39.653 --> 08:41.619
You having
a tough time here?

08:41.621 --> 08:45.923
Yeah. So Mommy says
there's a man bothering you.

08:45.925 --> 08:47.792
Can you tell me
what the man looks like?

08:57.104 --> 08:58.970
Tell them what he does.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.972
Well, he hits me.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.807
Yeah?
Where does he hit you?

09:02.809 --> 09:04.108
In your head?

09:04.110 --> 09:05.977
We're gonna try
to get rid of him.

09:05.979 --> 09:08.046
That sound good to you?

09:08.048 --> 09:09.413
I'm going to finish
talking with Mommy.

09:09.415 --> 09:12.984
- Is that okay?
- Yeah?

09:12.986 --> 09:14.519
- All right.
- All right.

09:14.521 --> 09:16.288
Just be careful, okay?

09:19.259 --> 09:20.792
Aw, he's adorable.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.360
Thanks.

09:22.362 --> 09:26.264
I get really down on myself
because I always wonder

09:26.266 --> 09:28.532
if I'm doing enough
for my son.

09:28.534 --> 09:30.001
You just
have to stay strong.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.936
There's sometimes
no other choice.

09:31.938 --> 09:35.974
It's a very lonely
daily existence.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.075
I gotta ask you,

09:37.077 --> 09:38.343
what are you hoping
we can do for you?

09:38.345 --> 09:41.413
There's something
attacking my son,

09:41.415 --> 09:43.481
and I would like for it
to be fixed.

09:43.483 --> 09:45.850
He's my world.
I have to protect him.

09:52.893 --> 09:54.960
What the...

09:54.962 --> 09:56.261
Did you touch me?

09:56.263 --> 09:57.896
- No.
- No?

09:57.898 --> 10:00.164
Somebody is capable of touching.

10:00.166 --> 10:03.134
I think it might be the guy.

10:03.136 --> 10:04.569
What makes me nervous, though,

10:04.571 --> 10:09.607
is that he might be touching
them inappropriately, sexually.

10:09.609 --> 10:12.176
He could be touching them, like,
caressing their hair

10:12.178 --> 10:14.179
or their face or their feet.

10:14.181 --> 10:18.582
He likes it when they become
emotional and upset and scared.

10:18.584 --> 10:21.886
He, like, breaks them down
mentally, psychologically.

10:21.888 --> 10:24.455
It's really bad
because it's all set

10:24.457 --> 10:27.058
on messing with
the living people here.

10:48.548 --> 10:49.948
So, Patty,
Nicole was telling me

10:49.950 --> 10:52.450
that you and your daughter
moved in here recently.

10:52.452 --> 10:53.885
Yeah, 8 months ago.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.953
Nicole called us in
because she thinks

10:55.955 --> 10:58.422
whatever is here is
going after her little boy.

10:58.424 --> 11:00.158
I mean,
you agree with that?

11:00.160 --> 11:01.493
Yes.

11:01.495 --> 11:04.962
There is a male figure
attacking at him.

11:04.964 --> 11:06.864
I have seen him very scared,

11:06.866 --> 11:09.300
and I don't know how
to help him.

11:09.302 --> 11:13.905
I try to make him
feel more safe.

11:13.907 --> 11:16.707
Why do you think whatever's
here is picking on him?

11:16.709 --> 11:19.910
I think
because he's young, um,

11:19.912 --> 11:22.247
and...

11:22.249 --> 11:26.117
he can
be manipulated easier.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.052
As far as you living here,

11:28.054 --> 11:29.521
I mean, have you had
experiences?

11:29.523 --> 11:33.324
I had something brush against me
while I was in bed.

11:33.326 --> 11:34.926
Were you awake at the time,
or did it wake you up?

11:34.928 --> 11:37.062
I was trying to go to sleep.

11:37.064 --> 11:38.730
Okay.
Did that ever happen again?

11:38.732 --> 11:42.600
I had movement on my bed,
and I turned the light on,

11:42.602 --> 11:44.069
and there was nothing there.

11:44.071 --> 11:46.037
Could it have been
one of Nicole's cats?

11:46.039 --> 11:48.673
They do not go up
in my room.

11:48.675 --> 11:51.209
Now do you think Nicole
and August are in danger here?

11:51.211 --> 11:53.378
Yes. I have seen him
very scared,

11:53.380 --> 11:55.679
and he's such a loving kid.

11:55.681 --> 11:58.616
So when you see him sad,
you know,

11:58.618 --> 12:00.051
you just want to
make it better for him.

12:03.857 --> 12:07.459
There is a nasty woman
up here.

12:07.461 --> 12:09.427
She does not want us here.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.896
She wants us to vacate
the premises.

12:11.898 --> 12:13.465
- Can you describe her?
- Okay.

12:13.467 --> 12:16.935
She looking, like,
stretched out right now.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.976
She's taking up, like,
from here

12:24.978 --> 12:27.612
all the way to the other post.

12:27.614 --> 12:29.747
This is her area.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.649
Everything is wide.

12:31.651 --> 12:34.352
I think she's related
to the angry guy.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.054
I think there's a lot
of competition

12:36.056 --> 12:38.456
between this male
and this female.

12:38.458 --> 12:42.393
I think they're, like,
competing for attention,

12:42.395 --> 12:44.095
but they hate each other.

12:46.533 --> 12:48.866
What kind of experiences
might the living have with her?

12:48.868 --> 12:51.869
She wants to be heard.
She wants to be seen.

12:51.871 --> 12:56.474
So I think the living see her
and hear her

12:56.476 --> 13:00.077
more than
any other dead person here.

13:00.079 --> 13:03.414
She likes that.
And she is pissed off.

13:03.416 --> 13:06.551
She is ranting and raving
and going back and forth.

13:06.553 --> 13:10.355
Living people would hear
a lot of pacing,

13:10.357 --> 13:12.690
noises, walking.

13:12.692 --> 13:15.426
I think she would, like,
slam the doors,

13:15.428 --> 13:18.863
throw...around.

13:18.865 --> 13:24.101
Anything physical like that
would be coming from her.

13:24.103 --> 13:28.907
She knows it scares them,
and that can take a toll.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.514
So, Carl, I understand that

13:36.516 --> 13:37.982
you're really close friends
with Nicole.

13:37.984 --> 13:41.052
Yes. I've known her...
approximately 25 years.

13:41.054 --> 13:43.488
That being said, I'm sure you've
spent time here at the house.

13:43.490 --> 13:44.855
Yes.

13:44.857 --> 13:47.325
She told me what's going on
here, and it sounds insane.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.928
- Have you had any experiences?
- Yes, I have.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.362
I was standing in the doorway
to the kitchen,

13:51.364 --> 13:52.663
looking towards
the laundry room,

13:52.665 --> 13:54.398
and I saw a black mist
float out

13:54.400 --> 13:58.269
from the laundry room
into the kitchen area.

13:58.271 --> 14:00.070
Now was there any cooking
going on in the kitchen?

14:00.072 --> 14:02.106
No, absolutely not.

14:02.108 --> 14:03.941
Had you ever seen anything
like that again in the house?

14:03.943 --> 14:06.144
I have seen a weird
stretched-out apparition

14:06.146 --> 14:07.946
in the piano room,
but there was no face on it.

14:07.948 --> 14:10.381
From here down,
it was, like, um,

14:10.383 --> 14:13.885
early 1900s dress,
like, frilly.

14:13.887 --> 14:15.753
What was the size,
you think?

14:15.755 --> 14:18.823
It was probably, stretched out,
about 6 feet long.

14:18.825 --> 14:20.592
All right. So did anybody else
see this thing?

14:20.594 --> 14:22.159
No. It had disappeared.

14:22.161 --> 14:23.728
All right.
So you've seen a couple things.

14:23.730 --> 14:24.963
Anything else?

14:24.965 --> 14:27.298
The second floor hallway is
an area where you always feel

14:27.300 --> 14:30.301
like you're being watched.
And down here in the basement,

14:30.303 --> 14:34.105
I'm pretty much the only one
who will come down here.

14:34.107 --> 14:36.173
You know, I gotta ask you.
Do you know the kid really well?

14:36.175 --> 14:37.508
Yes.

14:37.510 --> 14:39.443
So Nicole thinks something here
is going after August.

14:39.445 --> 14:41.845
- You agree?
- Absolutely.

14:41.847 --> 14:43.747
You can see when
he gets aggressive.

14:43.749 --> 14:46.017
So how do you know this is
not just kid nonsense?

14:46.019 --> 14:47.852
I've worked with children
for almost 30 years

14:47.854 --> 14:49.787
as a counselor and a teacher.

14:49.789 --> 14:51.723
This is something
I haven't seen before.

14:51.725 --> 14:54.292
He's scared, scared for him,
scared for Nicole.

14:58.164 --> 15:01.399
There's a weird
shape-shifter guy up here.

15:01.401 --> 15:05.069
He did keep showing me,
like, images of, like, a demon,

15:05.071 --> 15:08.139
him being a demon,

15:08.141 --> 15:12.877
and then it shifts,
and I see this man there.

15:12.879 --> 15:15.346
He looks like
an '80s metalhead guy

15:15.348 --> 15:17.482
but without a face,

15:17.484 --> 15:19.784
and like a kid.

15:19.786 --> 15:25.790
This is very much the focus
of a lot of bad stuff.

15:25.792 --> 15:29.560
They're getting the brunt,
the brunt of it.

15:29.562 --> 15:35.199
This is, like, the metalhead
demon...guy's sole focus,

15:35.201 --> 15:36.634
is make them lose faith

15:36.636 --> 15:40.037
and turn them into
a dark, evil person.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.943
He's whispering,
"You want to kill everybody.

15:45.945 --> 15:48.846
Best if you kill your family."

15:48.848 --> 15:52.950
He's trying to
either kill them

15:52.952 --> 15:56.321
or cause them to kill others.

16:08.318 --> 16:09.717
As soon as I get into town,

16:09.719 --> 16:12.920
the first call I make is to
the local cops.

16:12.922 --> 16:15.056
They knew all about
Nicole's property,

16:15.058 --> 16:17.191
and it turns out,
there was a murder-suicide

16:17.193 --> 16:19.761
right outside her front door.

16:19.763 --> 16:22.096
I'm driving over to meet
with a county sheriff who says

16:22.098 --> 16:25.066
it's one of the most senseless
killings he's ever seen.

16:30.940 --> 16:32.640
Well, Sheriff Hanna,
I appreciate

16:32.642 --> 16:34.375
you helping me out
with this case.

16:34.377 --> 16:35.643
What can you tell me
about the two guys

16:35.645 --> 16:37.245
involved in
this murder-suicide?

16:37.247 --> 16:39.547
The two gentlemen lived
next to the property

16:39.549 --> 16:40.815
that you're investigation.

16:40.817 --> 16:42.583
The two men were
next-door neighbors.

16:42.585 --> 16:46.788
First individual was a man
by the name of William Eck,

16:46.790 --> 16:48.122
49 years old.

16:48.124 --> 16:52.326
The other individual
was August Meinberg,

16:52.328 --> 16:55.729
who was a German immigrant,
60 years of age.

16:55.731 --> 16:57.865
What started the bad blood
between the two of them?

16:57.867 --> 17:01.736
Interestingly enough,
it was over their lawns.

17:03.506 --> 17:05.640
You know, I'm laughing because
I know that can get crazy.

17:05.642 --> 17:08.910
- What happened?
- This started in 1949,

17:08.912 --> 17:12.046
where William Eck had left
some trimmings,

17:12.048 --> 17:15.348
tree trimmings
on Meinberg's property.

17:15.351 --> 17:18.352
Resulted in
a verbal confrontation

17:18.354 --> 17:21.856
which escalated to
a physical altercation,

17:21.858 --> 17:24.992
and Eck ended up
choking Meinberg.

17:24.993 --> 17:28.695
A neighbor that witnessed
this had interceded

17:28.697 --> 17:30.131
and broke up the fight.

17:30.133 --> 17:32.132
Well, obviously, this doesn't
end well for either one of them.

17:32.134 --> 17:33.735
So what happened?

17:33.737 --> 17:35.903
Well, fast-forward 1 year.

17:35.905 --> 17:40.107
Once again,
a verbal altercation started,

17:40.109 --> 17:43.444
so Meinberg then retreated
into his home,

17:43.446 --> 17:48.015
emerged with a 12-gauge
sawed-off shotgun,

17:48.017 --> 17:51.219
leveled it at
William Eck's head,

17:51.221 --> 17:53.821
pulled the trigger,
blew his head off.

17:53.823 --> 17:56.791
So does he commit suicide
right there and then?

17:56.793 --> 18:01.896
He started waving the gun around
and ranting, "Who's next?"

18:01.898 --> 18:06.567
A neighbor stepped in and tried
to wrestle the shotgun from him,

18:06.569 --> 18:10.238
at which time, he turned
the gun on himself,

18:10.240 --> 18:12.640
pointed the shotgun
at his chest,

18:12.642 --> 18:14.975
and immediately killed
himself.

18:14.977 --> 18:17.144
Unbelievable.

18:17.146 --> 18:20.047
I mean, you weren't kidding when
you said this was senseless.

18:22.185 --> 18:26.254
I'm seeing that
metalhead demon guy again.

18:26.256 --> 18:29.557
I don't know if he lived here
for a while and moved out,

18:29.559 --> 18:31.893
but he's a bad, bad person.

18:33.863 --> 18:36.797
And I get the year 1942
with him,

18:36.799 --> 18:38.065
so it's kind of weird
that he's, like,

18:38.067 --> 18:41.768
portraying this '80s metalhead.

18:41.770 --> 18:46.340
Something happened that
caused him to lose his faith

18:46.342 --> 18:51.145
and become
an extremely dark individual.

18:51.147 --> 18:54.682
When he died,
he focused on being

18:54.684 --> 18:58.920
as negative and as evil
as possible.

18:58.922 --> 19:01.756
It's a possibility
that he killed somebody

19:01.758 --> 19:03.958
during his lifetime.

19:03.960 --> 19:05.692
Do you have any idea
how he died?

19:05.694 --> 19:08.696
He's talking something
about a suicide.

19:08.698 --> 19:10.331
I'm thinking maybe
he killed himself.

19:13.669 --> 19:15.102
So I've got
a mother worried sick

19:15.104 --> 19:16.503
for her 3-year-old son

19:16.505 --> 19:19.807
on a property next door
to the site of a murder-suicide,

19:19.809 --> 19:21.576
but I want to see
if there's anything else.

19:23.947 --> 19:27.114
Searching through old records,
I find a fatal car accident

19:27.116 --> 19:29.450
that happened in 1997.

19:29.452 --> 19:33.454
Turns out one of the victims
used to own Nicole's house.

19:33.456 --> 19:34.989
I'm headed over to meet
a local author

19:34.991 --> 19:37.525
who says the accident
devastated the family

19:37.527 --> 19:40.261
and eventually forced them to
have to move off the property.

19:47.470 --> 19:49.570
Before we even get to
the accident, what do you know

19:49.572 --> 19:51.138
about the family that
this happened to?

19:51.140 --> 19:53.274
Well, Ronny and Karen Robok

19:53.276 --> 19:56.610
bought your client's
property in 1975,

19:56.612 --> 19:58.679
and they moved in
with their three daughters.

19:58.681 --> 20:00.181
What do we know about Ronny?

20:00.183 --> 20:02.817
He was a supervisor
at a local supermarket.

20:02.819 --> 20:04.752
All right. So the day of
the accident, what happened?

20:04.754 --> 20:07.922
It was May 20, 1997.

20:07.924 --> 20:11.859
Ronny was on his way to work,
just a few miles from his house,

20:11.861 --> 20:16.964
and a tractor-trailer
swerved into oncoming traffic

20:16.966 --> 20:18.832
and hit six cars.

20:18.834 --> 20:22.002
Ronny's truck was crushed.
He died at the scene.

20:22.004 --> 20:24.839
Here is
the death certificate.

20:24.841 --> 20:26.741
Okay, so they pronounced
him right there.

20:26.743 --> 20:30.010
- Yes.
- Was Ronny the only victim?

20:30.012 --> 20:32.580
Four people were hurt, but Ronny
was the only one who died.

20:32.582 --> 20:34.648
So we got one DOA,
four injured.

20:34.650 --> 20:35.916
What about the driver?

20:35.918 --> 20:37.118
Ever figure out
what the hell happened?

20:37.120 --> 20:39.053
Benny Hilton was the driver.

20:39.055 --> 20:42.656
They found that he had been
driving 19 straight hours,

20:42.658 --> 20:44.258
which is twice as long
as he should've

20:44.260 --> 20:47.061
been driving without a break.
- Okay.

20:47.063 --> 20:49.896
They also found cocaine
in his system.

20:49.898 --> 20:51.465
Okay, so obviously,
he was negligent.

20:51.467 --> 20:52.666
What happened?

20:52.668 --> 20:54.935
He was in prison for 5 years

20:54.937 --> 20:58.505
and ordered to pay $145,000
to the family.

20:58.507 --> 21:00.741
What happened with the family?
They tried to stay in the home.

21:00.743 --> 21:03.610
It was just really
too sad for them,

21:03.612 --> 21:06.414
and they ended up
moving out in 2001.

21:08.951 --> 21:13.487
This metalhead demon guy
can really mess with the living.

21:13.489 --> 21:17.358
He likes to create heart issues,
stroke, convulsions.

21:17.360 --> 21:21.562
He also indicated an image
of a car accident,

21:21.564 --> 21:24.565
and he called it his "big try."

21:24.567 --> 21:29.170
It made me think
that he did try to cause

21:29.172 --> 21:32.707
or create a major car accident.

21:33.943 --> 21:38.145
I see two different scenarios.

21:38.147 --> 21:40.581
One was a male in a car.

21:40.583 --> 21:43.584
Then, I see a flash of a female.

21:43.586 --> 21:45.119
He expressed he liked doing

21:45.121 --> 21:48.589
because it could
potentially kill them,

21:48.591 --> 21:51.725
or it could be a possibility
that in the future,

21:51.727 --> 21:54.562
he's going to attempt this.

22:00.369 --> 22:02.403
For more information
about the show,

22:02.405 --> 22:04.005
and if you need us
to investigate

22:04.007 --> 22:05.873
unexplained activity
in your home...

22:05.875 --> 22:09.342
Please visit
travelchannel.com/thedeadfiles.

22:09.344 --> 22:10.677
Click on
"Help me, Dead Files!"

22:10.679 --> 22:12.646
to submit your story,
and we'll help if we can.

22:21.307 --> 22:23.574
You know, another thing
caught my eye in research.

22:23.576 --> 22:26.343
A family called the Gromans
owned my client's property

22:26.345 --> 22:27.978
for over 60 years,

22:27.980 --> 22:29.447
and they suffered
a lot of death.

22:29.449 --> 22:31.281
I managed to track down
a descendant

22:31.283 --> 22:33.984
who says when they weren't busy
burying family members,

22:33.986 --> 22:36.120
they were busy fighting
with one another.

22:42.027 --> 22:43.094
Well, Richard,
thanks for meeting with me.

22:43.096 --> 22:44.327
I appreciate that.

22:44.329 --> 22:46.163
Your family owned
my client's property

22:46.165 --> 22:48.699
for over 6 decades.
When was that?

22:48.701 --> 22:51.202
The house was built
in 1894

22:51.204 --> 22:54.572
by my great-great-uncle,
Thomas Groman.

22:54.574 --> 22:56.307
And here is his picture.

22:56.309 --> 23:00.076
And he owned
the property until 1908,

23:00.078 --> 23:04.081
when he sold it
to his mother, Rebecca.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.549
So now Rebecca
has got the property.

23:05.551 --> 23:06.750
How's that work out
for her?

23:06.752 --> 23:09.252
She owns the property
until 1912,

23:09.254 --> 23:13.257
but she gets kidney failure
and heart disease and dies.

23:13.259 --> 23:15.092
Here is
her death certificate.

23:15.094 --> 23:17.094
Okay, so she was only there
for a couple years.

23:17.096 --> 23:18.929
Yes, for 4 years.

23:18.931 --> 23:23.333
The property is now
transferred to Maybelle,

23:23.335 --> 23:25.102
and that was
the daughter of Rebecca.

23:25.104 --> 23:29.306
She lives there with
her husband for 5 years.

23:29.308 --> 23:31.108
So why only 5 years
on the property?

23:31.110 --> 23:33.643
Maybelle is diagnosed
with uterine cancer,

23:33.645 --> 23:35.445
and she dies in 1918.

23:35.447 --> 23:38.449
And here is
her death certificate,

23:38.451 --> 23:40.851
and she's only 39 years old,
which is very young.

23:40.853 --> 23:42.119
What a shame.

23:48.528 --> 23:52.929
I'm seeing the woman who's
related to the angry guy again.

23:52.931 --> 23:54.731
Do you have much idea
who she was in life?

23:54.733 --> 23:58.001
I think that she lived here.

24:00.539 --> 24:01.806
Any idea when?

24:01.808 --> 24:04.141
Like 1915, and in that time,

24:04.143 --> 24:06.744
she was looking to be
in her 40s or 50s.

24:09.481 --> 24:12.683
And she's white
and she's got brown eyes.

24:16.222 --> 24:19.289
Any idea how she's related
to this angry guy?

24:19.291 --> 24:21.926
I don't know. I don't know,
but they...hate each other.

24:24.163 --> 24:26.931
Okay, so now Maybelle's dead.
What happens to the property?

24:26.933 --> 24:29.166
Eventually, it ends up
in the hands

24:29.168 --> 24:30.901
of Maybelle's nephew,
George.

24:30.903 --> 24:32.135
What do you know
about this guy?

24:32.137 --> 24:35.105
George was the black sheep
of the family.

24:35.107 --> 24:36.740
Okay, so black sheep
of the family.

24:36.742 --> 24:37.908
What's the story with that?

24:37.910 --> 24:41.144
One of the sort of
famous stories was

24:41.146 --> 24:42.980
he eloped
and got married in 1907

24:42.982 --> 24:44.381
to a woman
by the name of Hannah.

24:44.383 --> 24:47.084
Within a year, he was
walking down the street

24:47.086 --> 24:49.954
with two girls on his arm,
and his wife caught him...

24:49.956 --> 24:52.890
and he bolted into
the nearest hotel

24:52.892 --> 24:54.325
to try to hide.

24:54.327 --> 24:55.860
This was
such a crazy story,

24:55.862 --> 24:58.395
it made the newspapers
here in town.

24:58.397 --> 25:00.798
And here is a copy
of the newspapers --

25:00.800 --> 25:03.667
"Chased Her Husband
And Girl Companions."

25:05.671 --> 25:07.037
I don't mean to laugh
at your family...

25:07.039 --> 25:08.338
- Yeah.
- ...but this is pretty funny.

25:08.340 --> 25:09.673
Well, I...
It's funny.

25:09.675 --> 25:11.408
So does George wind up
getting divorced?

25:11.410 --> 25:13.043
- What happens?
- No.

25:13.045 --> 25:15.379
He and Hannah stay married,

25:15.381 --> 25:17.748
but he does move back
into the property

25:17.750 --> 25:21.685
you're investigating that
his parents were living in.

25:21.687 --> 25:23.954
Does he stop there
and just straighten out?

25:23.956 --> 25:26.356
No, he doesn't.
George was an alcoholic.

25:26.358 --> 25:32.329
In 1930, he was passed out in
his car on the railroad tracks,

25:32.331 --> 25:33.831
and the train was coming.

25:33.833 --> 25:35.065
Luckily,
there were cops nearby.

25:35.067 --> 25:37.134
They pulled him out
of the car,

25:37.136 --> 25:39.303
so he didn't get hit
by the train,

25:39.305 --> 25:41.471
and he was arrested.

25:41.473 --> 25:45.175
Five years later, he was
in a serious car accident.

25:45.177 --> 25:48.479
Drunk again, he wrapped
the car around a pole.

25:48.481 --> 25:49.779
What ever happens to him?

25:49.781 --> 25:51.848
He eventually dies in 1952.

25:51.850 --> 25:54.851
He's 64 years old.
He's still living in the house.

25:54.853 --> 25:58.055
And here is
his death certificate.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.157
He died of rectal cancer.

26:03.495 --> 26:06.730
So we just have
this angry guy.

26:06.732 --> 26:13.637
I couldn't gather if it was
his home, a business, or both.

26:13.639 --> 26:15.939
It's even hard to know
what he did for a living.

26:15.941 --> 26:18.409
He lived here for awhile
and moved out

26:18.411 --> 26:20.010
and had come back.

26:22.748 --> 26:27.751
I think the dude
would hang out down here.

26:27.753 --> 26:31.321
He used to come down here
to escape his family.

26:31.323 --> 26:33.323
So what's going on
with him and his family?

26:33.325 --> 26:37.227
He felt like they were a burden,
took time away from

26:37.229 --> 26:40.464
what he really wanted
to be thinking about or doing.

26:40.466 --> 26:44.735
"You can't be down here.
This is my space.

26:44.737 --> 26:46.536
You need to leave."

26:46.538 --> 26:50.774
I think he just hated all people
and just wanted to be alone

26:50.776 --> 26:53.010
so he could just do his thing.

26:53.012 --> 26:57.715
It's just much harder for him
to live with people.

26:57.717 --> 27:01.085
He did fantasize about --
about -- about killing

27:01.087 --> 27:04.354
and -- and torture.

27:04.356 --> 27:08.058
I'm hoping that this was
just his fantasy world.

27:08.060 --> 27:09.726
And that lady I saw,

27:09.728 --> 27:13.998
I don't think she was...
like, psycho in that way.

27:14.000 --> 27:16.533
Maybe that's why
she hated him so much

27:16.535 --> 27:18.135
'cause he's, like, a monster.

27:26.212 --> 27:28.946
I saw several disturbing
things during my walk,

27:28.948 --> 27:30.614
but two stood out.

27:30.616 --> 27:33.483
First, the angry woman
at the top of the stairs.

27:33.485 --> 27:37.287
She was very petite,
pale skin.

27:37.289 --> 27:39.756
She had high cheekbones.

27:39.758 --> 27:42.459
She stretched
her entire face.

27:42.461 --> 27:44.961
Next, I described
the metalhead demon guy

27:44.963 --> 27:47.030
tormenting a living person.

27:47.032 --> 27:50.901
I was in a bedroom,
and there was a dead male

27:50.903 --> 27:53.704
kneeling to the side

27:53.706 --> 27:56.140
of the individual in the bed.

27:58.310 --> 28:01.578
And he had long,
heavy metal-looking hair.

28:08.254 --> 28:11.121
Amy, is that what
you saw?

28:11.123 --> 28:12.923
Yes, that's what I saw.

28:33.279 --> 28:36.146
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

28:36.148 --> 28:38.281
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

28:38.283 --> 28:40.617
and our clients
for the first time.

28:40.619 --> 28:42.586
Well, Amy,
I'd like you to meet Nicole.

28:42.588 --> 28:44.754
She lives here with
her 3-year-old son, August.

28:44.756 --> 28:46.123
That's him right here.

28:46.125 --> 28:47.891
She also has
a couple of roommates,

28:47.893 --> 28:49.560
but activity here is so bad,

28:49.562 --> 28:51.595
they're planning on
not sticking around.

28:51.597 --> 28:53.497
This is
her long-time friend Carl,

28:53.499 --> 28:56.966
and he's also had
a ton of experiences here,

28:56.968 --> 28:59.169
but both of them are convinced
that whatever's here

28:59.171 --> 29:01.738
in this house
is going after August.

29:01.740 --> 29:02.840
They feel if we can't help them,

29:02.842 --> 29:04.474
that he's gonna be scarred
for life.

29:04.476 --> 29:06.843
So now that Amy knows
a little bit about you guys,

29:06.845 --> 29:09.646
I'll ask her to describe
her walk for us.

29:12.317 --> 29:15.452
So I encountered this
deceased woman upstairs.

29:15.454 --> 29:18.322
It was obvious that
she didn't want me here,

29:18.324 --> 29:20.857
and I was not welcome.

29:20.859 --> 29:24.861
She does really like
scaring the living here,

29:24.863 --> 29:28.532
even though she knows that
it's causing people here

29:28.534 --> 29:31.568
psychological trauma.

29:31.570 --> 29:34.605
She doesn't really care
because she is so desperate

29:34.607 --> 29:36.372
for any kind of attention.

29:36.374 --> 29:39.009
And one of the things
she'll do

29:39.011 --> 29:41.011
if she gets bored
or frustrated

29:41.013 --> 29:43.447
is she'll throw tantrums.

29:43.449 --> 29:46.350
When she has these tantrums
and she's stomping around,

29:46.352 --> 29:49.653
you might hear, like,
stomping sounds.

29:49.655 --> 29:50.887
Wow.

29:50.889 --> 29:54.123
There is a pounding
on the floor,

29:54.125 --> 29:56.894
almost like somebody
is holding a broom handle

29:56.896 --> 30:00.163
and pounding against
the basement floor.

30:00.165 --> 30:01.331
Interesting.

30:01.333 --> 30:04.401
She may try
to actually be seen.

30:04.403 --> 30:08.338
One of the things that she can
do is actually throw things.

30:08.340 --> 30:10.907
Nicole, tell her
about the fire truck.

30:10.909 --> 30:13.176
There is a fire truck
near the mantel,

30:13.178 --> 30:16.846
and it'll fly off
about 3 feet.

30:16.848 --> 30:19.216
You said it's possible they
might be able to see this woman.

30:19.218 --> 30:22.185
Any idea what it would
look like to them?

30:22.187 --> 30:24.488
Yeah, so her whole face
and body was, like,

30:24.490 --> 30:26.356
stretched out like that,

30:26.358 --> 30:29.926
indicating to me, like,
"This is my territory."

30:29.928 --> 30:33.030
I had a sketch done
of what I saw.

30:42.241 --> 30:43.407
That's interesting.

30:51.683 --> 30:54.117
My.

30:56.488 --> 30:59.756
I've seen an apparition
stretched, too, at the top,

30:59.758 --> 31:03.327
but appeared to be a woman
from about here on up.

31:03.329 --> 31:04.827
Interesting.

31:04.829 --> 31:08.264
About -- We figured about
6 feet long, about a foot wide.

31:08.266 --> 31:10.701
So did you get any idea of
who this woman could've been?

31:10.703 --> 31:13.170
I had a hard time
with that,

31:13.172 --> 31:14.904
but a couple of things
stood out.

31:14.906 --> 31:17.774
She was white,
brown eyes, brown hair.

31:17.776 --> 31:19.443
Probably in her 40s.

31:19.445 --> 31:20.910
She kind of came from

31:20.912 --> 31:24.080
a really kind of dysfunctional,
crazy family,

31:24.082 --> 31:28.985
and that she lived here at some
point between 1915 and 1925.

31:28.987 --> 31:31.755
That's not a ton to go on,
but based on the time period,

31:31.757 --> 31:33.656
I've got an idea
of who it might've been.

31:33.658 --> 31:35.926
From 1912 to 1918,
this place was owned

31:35.928 --> 31:38.061
by a woman named
Maybelle Groman.

31:38.063 --> 31:39.263
Her relatives
are actually the ones

31:39.265 --> 31:41.498
that built this house in 1894.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.100
Five years after
she got this place,

31:43.102 --> 31:45.335
she was diagnosed
with uterine cancer,

31:45.337 --> 31:48.871
and she died from the disease
a few months later.

31:48.873 --> 31:50.874
Here's her death certificate.

31:50.876 --> 31:52.309
You got it pretty spot on,
on the age,

31:52.311 --> 31:53.877
'cause look how old she was
when she died.

31:53.879 --> 31:56.113
She was 39.

31:56.115 --> 31:58.014
That's awful.

31:58.016 --> 31:59.616
Is it possible
it's Maybelle Groman

31:59.618 --> 32:00.850
that you might've seen?

32:00.852 --> 32:05.222
Time-wise, age-wise,
interesting. Yeah.

32:09.295 --> 32:12.029
The next person that
I ran into

32:12.031 --> 32:15.599
was a deceased male
who is related to her.

32:15.601 --> 32:17.034
This male
used to live here,

32:17.036 --> 32:22.706
but I got that he was from
a much more recent time period,

32:22.708 --> 32:24.240
maybe the '60s.

32:24.242 --> 32:27.744
It seemed like he had moved out
and then had moved back in.

32:27.746 --> 32:30.347
I couldn't initially tell
how he was related,

32:30.349 --> 32:35.585
but the thing with this guy
is that he was very unstable

32:35.587 --> 32:37.587
while he was alive,

32:37.589 --> 32:42.926
and he <i> really</i> despised
his family,

32:42.928 --> 32:47.297
and I saw him fantasizing
about murdering them.

32:47.299 --> 32:52.368
<i>He did fantasize about</i>
<i>killing and -- and torture.</i>

32:52.370 --> 32:55.405
<i>I'm hoping that this was</i>
<i>just his fantasy world.</i>

32:55.407 --> 32:58.074
<i>Maybe that's why</i>
<i>she hated him so much</i>

32:58.076 --> 33:00.343
<i>'cause he's, like, a monster.</i>

33:00.345 --> 33:03.413
I saw him mostly hanging out
in the basement.

33:03.415 --> 33:05.548
That's where he likes to be,

33:05.550 --> 33:08.819
because he can be alone,
away from everybody.

33:08.821 --> 33:13.423
The guy sounds a lot like
Maybelle Groman's nephew George.

33:13.425 --> 33:15.992
Now after Maybelle died, this
property eventually went to him.

33:15.994 --> 33:18.361
But the guy you saw, George,
lived here a couple of times,

33:18.363 --> 33:19.896
first in the early 1900s,

33:19.898 --> 33:21.764
and then again
about 15 years later.

33:21.766 --> 33:24.067
Now I talked to one
of Groman's descendants.

33:24.069 --> 33:25.969
He told me George was
the black sheep of the family

33:25.971 --> 33:28.438
and he embarrassed them
his entire life.

33:28.440 --> 33:31.307
In 1907, he eloped
with his wife, Hannah.

33:31.309 --> 33:33.710
A year later, he was caught
in broad daylight

33:33.712 --> 33:35.846
cheating on her with two women.

33:35.848 --> 33:37.580
After this,
the two of them separated,

33:37.582 --> 33:40.517
and he ended up moving back
into the house with his parents.

33:40.519 --> 33:43.253
So the descendant
I spoke to said that

33:43.255 --> 33:44.987
the family allowed him to
move back in here

33:44.989 --> 33:48.458
so they could keep an eye on him
and maybe try to control him,

33:48.460 --> 33:50.059
but that didn't work out.

33:50.061 --> 33:51.461
1930, he got drunk,

33:51.463 --> 33:54.064
passed out in his car
on the railroad tracks.

33:54.066 --> 33:55.198
Dear.

33:55.200 --> 33:56.867
And the cops saw it
and saved him.

33:56.869 --> 33:59.469
They actually pulled him out...

33:59.471 --> 34:01.071
Five years later, he actually
totaled his car

34:01.073 --> 34:03.173
while driving drunk,
and he got seriously injured.

34:03.175 --> 34:06.142
Now, George ended up dying
in 1952 of rectal cancer,

34:06.144 --> 34:09.277
and he was 64 years old
at the time of his death.

34:09.280 --> 34:12.149
Now, is it possible the guy
you saw is George Groman?

34:12.150 --> 34:13.884
Sounds like this one
could be him.

34:13.886 --> 34:15.018
Yeah. Yeah.

34:15.020 --> 34:16.753
Now does he do anything
to the living here?

34:16.755 --> 34:20.389
Yeah. He is capable of getting
physical, so he can caress.

34:20.391 --> 34:23.226
He can get violent
and possibly hit.

34:23.228 --> 34:24.895
Tell Amy about when you got
touched on the hip.

34:24.897 --> 34:26.329
Yes.

34:26.331 --> 34:29.966
I've been pushed on the hips,
various rooms of the house.

34:29.967 --> 34:31.833
One of the things that
he did to me

34:31.835 --> 34:35.036
was up at the top of the stairs,
caressing my back,

34:35.039 --> 34:36.873
and then it was playing
with my hair,

34:36.875 --> 34:39.775
but, like, in a...
creepy...

34:39.777 --> 34:41.511
- Yeah.
- You know what I'm saying?

34:41.513 --> 34:45.181
Like, I saw him watching
living people in the shower.

34:45.183 --> 34:49.252
I saw him wanting to be
inappropriate with the living.

34:49.254 --> 34:51.320
You felt like you were being
watched in the shower.

34:51.322 --> 34:55.591
Yes. Yeah, bathroom is
a hot spot for sure.

34:55.592 --> 34:58.328
What I'm really concerned
about is how he likes

34:58.330 --> 35:00.597
to mess with your mind.

35:00.599 --> 35:04.868
<i>He likes it when they become</i>
<i>emotional and upset and scared.</i>

35:04.870 --> 35:08.204
<i>He, like, breaks them down</i>
<i>mentally, psychologically.</i>

35:08.206 --> 35:11.207
<i>It's really bad</i>
<i>because it's all set</i>

35:11.209 --> 35:14.077
<i>on messing with</i>
<i>the living people here.</i>

35:14.079 --> 35:15.645
The other thing with
this guy

35:15.647 --> 35:19.749
is that he can create
and cause hallucinations.

35:19.751 --> 35:22.018
He said that he can
go into your mind

35:22.020 --> 35:24.821
and project back to you
what you're afraid of.

35:24.823 --> 35:29.091
My son
sees a man constantly.

35:29.093 --> 35:31.828
He describes him as...

35:31.830 --> 35:35.231
red with a mustache.

35:35.233 --> 35:38.034
Now, Amy, you said he can
project what you're afraid of.

35:38.036 --> 35:40.036
Both of them have seen
shadow figures.

35:40.038 --> 35:42.105
Last night, I literally
saw somebody

35:42.107 --> 35:43.806
running through
my dining room.

35:43.808 --> 35:47.310
I saw black mist creeping in
from the laundry room,

35:47.312 --> 35:48.578
along the ceiling.

35:48.580 --> 35:50.847
It's <i> bad.</i>

35:55.720 --> 35:56.953
Okay, anything else?

35:56.955 --> 36:00.189
This next person that I met
was a deceased male.

36:00.191 --> 36:03.393
First encountered him,
I thought he was a demon.

36:03.395 --> 36:06.596
But it's not.
It's a dead male.

36:06.598 --> 36:09.799
He presented
his human form to me,

36:09.801 --> 36:14.437
and it looked like
an '80s heavy metal rocker.

36:14.439 --> 36:18.174
He's obsessed with
harming living people.

36:18.176 --> 36:21.877
He's been trying to do this
for a very long time.

36:21.879 --> 36:24.080
One of the things
he was focused on

36:24.082 --> 36:27.683
was him talking about
his "big try."

36:27.685 --> 36:31.287
He was showing me
a massive car accident.

36:31.289 --> 36:33.557
He was leading me to believe
that this is something

36:33.559 --> 36:35.391
that had occurred
in the past,

36:35.393 --> 36:39.695
and something that he may work
on doing in the future as well.

36:39.697 --> 36:42.031
One of the people who
owned this house at one point

36:42.033 --> 36:44.634
died in a very horrible
car accident.

36:44.636 --> 36:48.504
So from 1975 to 2001, this house
was owned by the Robok family.

36:48.506 --> 36:53.109
In May of 1997, Ronny Robok left
for work, and then on the way,

36:53.111 --> 36:55.178
a semi-truck drifted into
oncoming traffic

36:55.180 --> 36:58.381
and hit this poor guy,
killing him instantly.

36:58.383 --> 37:01.183
Got his death certificate here.

37:01.185 --> 37:02.752
Okay, so is it possible
the metalhead

37:02.754 --> 37:04.187
had something to do
with this crash?

37:04.189 --> 37:06.723
I think
it's a big possibility.

37:06.725 --> 37:09.725
Yes.

37:09.727 --> 37:12.729
So is this guy capable
of doing that to these guys?

37:12.731 --> 37:14.364
Yes.

37:14.366 --> 37:16.533
I'm worried because I got
that he's focused

37:16.535 --> 37:18.334
on a young person here.

37:18.336 --> 37:20.403
He likes to mess with this
person while they're sleeping,

37:20.405 --> 37:21.537
and this is what he does.

37:21.539 --> 37:23.272
He plants negative thoughts

37:23.274 --> 37:25.342
to make the living person
do his bidding.

37:25.344 --> 37:27.811
So I had a sketch done
of what I saw happening

37:27.813 --> 37:29.446
with this dead man.

37:38.924 --> 37:40.123
It's kind of creepy.

37:45.496 --> 37:46.896
Wow.

37:49.801 --> 37:52.501
Yeah, my son...
Jeez.

37:52.503 --> 37:55.438
Yeah, my son did say
he had a lot of hair,

37:55.440 --> 37:58.041
and that he can
make himself into anything.

38:00.845 --> 38:04.847
You felt like August
was taken over a few times.

38:04.849 --> 38:08.651
Yes. My son came running
and really super scared,

38:08.653 --> 38:12.188
and all of a sudden,
he didn't have fear anymore.

38:12.190 --> 38:13.789
He just stood up,
came over to me,

38:13.791 --> 38:15.925
and slapped me
in the face...

38:15.927 --> 38:17.259
Yeah.

38:17.261 --> 38:19.729
...and then became extremely
disoriented afterwards

38:19.731 --> 38:22.498
and was calling my name,
and I know that wasn't him.

38:22.500 --> 38:23.733
Yeah. It wasn't him.

38:23.735 --> 38:26.069
Now could he have
put the idea in Auggy?

38:26.071 --> 38:27.937
Yes. Yeah, absolutely.

38:27.939 --> 38:29.305
He would've been, you know,

38:29.307 --> 38:32.308
possessed by this
freaking maniac to do it.

38:35.080 --> 38:37.880
The thing that scares me about
him is that he wants death.

38:37.882 --> 38:40.817
He wants this person
to kill people.

38:42.287 --> 38:44.320
Wow.

38:44.322 --> 38:47.724
Honestly, can't believe
that this could be happening.

38:47.726 --> 38:50.293
Like, why my son?
Like, why?

38:50.295 --> 38:55.498
This person just wants
death, mayhem, and murder.

38:55.500 --> 38:57.500
Any means necessary.

38:57.502 --> 39:01.371
It is on par with demons.

39:03.241 --> 39:05.074
Are you serious?

39:17.255 --> 39:18.455
So, Nicole, you called us in

39:18.457 --> 39:21.090
because you were worried
about your son August,

39:21.092 --> 39:22.459
and it's a good thing you did

39:22.461 --> 39:24.260
because based on
what Amy's told us,

39:24.262 --> 39:28.597
the problem was a lot worse
than you realized.

39:28.599 --> 39:30.200
But now it's time
to answer the big question.

39:30.202 --> 39:33.570
Can you raise your son
here safely,

39:33.572 --> 39:35.671
or do you need
to get the hell out?

39:35.673 --> 39:37.540
For that answer,
I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

39:40.211 --> 39:45.314
A lot of things need
to happen simultaneously.

39:45.316 --> 39:50.053
The first thing is your son
needs a full-blown exorcism.

39:50.055 --> 39:53.122
- An exorcism?
- Yes.

39:53.124 --> 39:55.592
Now this doesn't necessarily
have to be done

39:55.594 --> 39:57.994
by a Catholic priest,

39:57.996 --> 40:01.064
but an exorcism
has to be performed

40:01.066 --> 40:06.469
because he has been utilized
by this metalhead guy

40:06.471 --> 40:08.505
for a very long time,

40:08.507 --> 40:12.642
and we need him
completely 100%

40:12.644 --> 40:14.510
out of your son.

40:16.914 --> 40:21.083
At the same time, a psychic
and a medium will be showing up,

40:21.085 --> 40:23.453
and they are going to remove

40:23.455 --> 40:27.590
the three deceased individuals
from this home.

40:27.592 --> 40:31.927
Now at the same time, you're
going to be being dealt with

40:31.929 --> 40:33.596
by a reiki master,

40:33.598 --> 40:36.732
who's going to remove
any and all cords from you

40:36.734 --> 40:39.335
that these dead people
have attached.

40:39.337 --> 40:41.203
This must all happen
at the same time.

40:41.205 --> 40:43.072
It has to be
without a hitch.

40:43.074 --> 40:45.809
It has to be going on
simultaneously,

40:45.811 --> 40:49.545
so this is going to be
one heck of a day.

40:49.547 --> 40:50.880
Okay.

40:50.882 --> 40:52.415
And what would happen
if she picked up and moved?

40:52.417 --> 40:57.386
Even if you were to leave,
they would go with you.

40:57.388 --> 41:01.291
I know it's a lot, but are you
gonna take Amy's advice?

41:01.293 --> 41:02.625
Yes, absolutely.

41:02.627 --> 41:05.227
Without a shadow
of a doubt, I will.

41:05.229 --> 41:06.896
It's my job as a mother.

41:06.898 --> 41:10.700
I have to do anything
I can for him.

41:10.702 --> 41:13.269
I don't know how much Carl can
help, but what can he do?

41:13.271 --> 41:16.039
Just being supportive and
helping as much as possible.

41:16.041 --> 41:17.573
Okay, will do.

41:17.575 --> 41:19.742
We have to get this fixed.

41:19.744 --> 41:22.078
I value, you know,
what you say.

41:22.080 --> 41:23.379
I would've gone crazy.

41:23.381 --> 41:26.983
I mean, I really appreciate
this, so thank you.

41:29.487 --> 41:31.187
I wish it were easier,

41:31.189 --> 41:32.588
but if Nicole is going
to overcome

41:32.590 --> 41:34.857
what's happening
to her and August,

41:34.859 --> 41:37.927
she needs to simultaneously
perform the exorcism

41:37.929 --> 41:41.463
while the medium, psychic,
and reiki master remove the dead

41:41.465 --> 41:43.666
and sever their attachments
to the living.

41:43.668 --> 41:47.670
Only then will she and her son
get the peace they deserve.
