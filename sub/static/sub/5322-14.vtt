WEBVTT

00:01.006 --> 00:03.613
So, how do I look?

00:03.614 --> 00:05.965
Like Special Agent Rodriguez.

00:07.005 --> 00:08.381
What's with the pantsuit?

00:08.382 --> 00:11.746
Oh! Is it laundry day and all of
your big sweatpants are in the wash?

00:12.095 --> 00:14.486
No. Benji's gonna get here any minute.

00:14.487 --> 00:16.285
Oh, I can't believe your
chubby-wubby little brother

00:16.286 --> 00:18.697
is moving to San Francisco
to work for mayor...

00:19.589 --> 00:21.709
John... Bill...

00:21.710 --> 00:22.910
Ed Lee.

00:22.911 --> 00:24.645
Mayor Ed Lee?

00:25.319 --> 00:26.519
I suppose.

00:27.594 --> 00:29.094
Anyway, I'm dressed like this

00:29.095 --> 00:32.305
because I want Benji to know that I'm
working at Garber, Stukenbaker and Rizz.

00:32.307 --> 00:34.086
You got your old job back?

00:34.087 --> 00:35.465
No. But did that sound believable?

00:35.466 --> 00:38.178
Because he cannot know that
I lost my job, Gabi, okay?

00:38.179 --> 00:41.181
We're... we're Rodriguezes.
We... we work. We succeed.

00:41.182 --> 00:43.540
We do not play "Candy Crush" while
falling asleep in the middle of the day

00:43.541 --> 00:44.833
watching <i>Ice Road Truckers </i>.

00:45.950 --> 00:48.085
So, will you help me pretend
like I still have my job?

00:48.570 --> 00:49.770
Please...

00:49.771 --> 00:51.910
I am the mayor of pretend town.

00:52.195 --> 00:54.001
The Ed Lee, if you will.

00:54.701 --> 00:57.828
Oh, man. I can't wait till the
three of us are back together again.

00:57.976 --> 00:59.375
Oh, and I made him his favorite dinner...

00:59.376 --> 01:01.677
Chicken fingers shaped
like little dinosaurs

01:01.678 --> 01:03.158
and a fudgy cake for dessert.

01:03.159 --> 01:04.875
You know, he's not 10 anymore, Gabi.

01:04.876 --> 01:08.612
Yeah, I know. But to me, he'll
always be my little Benji, The Hut.

01:10.382 --> 01:11.914
That's him!

01:12.951 --> 01:14.519
Benji!

01:15.866 --> 01:17.066
Benji?

01:17.262 --> 01:18.462
Hey, guys!

01:18.668 --> 01:21.237
Why am I dressed like this you ask? Well...

01:21.238 --> 01:24.704
that's because I just returned from a
rigorous day of trading stock options

01:24.705 --> 01:26.586
and yelling at woefully incompetent people.

01:27.127 --> 01:28.327
Okay then...

01:28.905 --> 01:30.340
Hey, Gabi!

01:30.374 --> 01:31.781
Hey!

01:32.413 --> 01:33.880
Aw, did you make that for me?

01:33.881 --> 01:35.782
Yeah! Would I like a piece of that...

01:36.677 --> 01:39.218
I mean, um, ah, would
you like a piece of this?

01:39.814 --> 01:41.777
What I'm saying is, who wants a piece...

01:42.553 --> 01:43.753
of cake?

01:45.000 --> 01:51.074

02:07.956 --> 02:09.156
Good morning.

02:10.193 --> 02:11.735
Were you watching me sleep?

02:12.359 --> 02:13.559
Me?

02:13.594 --> 02:16.394
No, no. I'm... I was too busy reading...

02:16.395 --> 02:17.894
Oh, yes. Just what I thought...

02:17.895 --> 02:19.769
21 essential vitamins and minerals.

02:21.534 --> 02:24.518
Me? Another promotion?

02:24.519 --> 02:27.271
Wow! This really is a meteoric rise!

02:29.196 --> 02:31.129
Okay, okay. Bye.

02:31.410 --> 02:32.877
Look at my big sis...

02:32.912 --> 02:34.312
Taking over the world!

02:34.346 --> 02:37.054
Oh! My little brother
working for the mayor!

02:37.055 --> 02:38.255
...Ed Lee.

02:39.184 --> 02:40.384
I know stuff.

02:41.954 --> 02:44.420
Do you know how to get out of a noogie?

02:44.421 --> 02:47.088
No, Benji! No!

02:48.459 --> 02:51.095
- I'm gonna grab a shower.
- Okay. Me, too.

02:51.316 --> 02:53.931
I mean... you know, once you're out of it.

02:54.083 --> 02:56.277
Unless, you know... I'm kidding!

02:57.736 --> 03:00.227
Okay. Well, I am gonna go...

03:00.228 --> 03:02.933
hang out at the car dealership
on the corner for the day.

03:02.934 --> 03:04.168
Do they still have free Wi-Fi?

03:04.169 --> 03:06.618
Mm-hmm. And donuts!
Oh, my gosh! You know...

03:06.619 --> 03:08.858
speaking of delicious things...

03:08.968 --> 03:13.895
Uh, your brother is really gotten all...

03:15.227 --> 03:16.427
You know?

03:16.428 --> 03:17.807
Mmm... no.

03:18.110 --> 03:21.135
What I'm saying is, uh... What
if I, ah, what if I asked him out?

03:22.422 --> 03:23.923
Are you attracted to my brother?

03:23.924 --> 03:25.557
Yeah! Aren't you?

03:27.139 --> 03:28.339
Okay.

03:28.545 --> 03:30.980
You better be kidding,
because that would be sick.

03:30.981 --> 03:32.415
Okay? We grew up together.

03:32.416 --> 03:34.964
Going out with him would be like
going on a date with your own brother.

03:34.965 --> 03:37.586
Uh, except I'd be dating your brother,

03:37.621 --> 03:39.888
who I am not related to in any way.

03:40.839 --> 03:43.425
Gabi, you cannot ask my brother out.

03:43.459 --> 03:45.643
I totally get it... Why?

03:45.671 --> 03:49.597
Uh, well, because it's awkward, it's
weird and it's just not going to happen.

03:49.632 --> 03:51.599
- So...
- We'll talk about it later.

03:51.634 --> 03:52.834
Bye!

03:55.938 --> 03:57.785
I'm glad I got you before you left.

03:57.786 --> 03:59.639
I just got an e-mail
from the mayor's office...

03:59.657 --> 04:01.842
he's invited the staff to
a cocktail party tonight.

04:01.876 --> 04:03.133
Wanna go?

04:05.880 --> 04:07.214
Abs...

04:07.249 --> 04:08.449
...solutely.

04:09.029 --> 04:10.884
I mean, no. I mean...

04:11.878 --> 04:14.587
Wait, you asked me to go with you.

04:14.588 --> 04:17.310
I didn't ask you to go with me.

04:17.646 --> 04:18.880
That's right.

04:20.015 --> 04:22.087
So, pick you up at 7:00?

04:22.396 --> 04:23.933
You know where I live...

04:26.344 --> 04:27.544
For now.

04:31.184 --> 04:33.264
I think I'm gonna get a
wooden owl for the terrace...

04:33.265 --> 04:34.604
Scare the birds away.

04:34.699 --> 04:36.070
I like the birds.

04:36.071 --> 04:37.727
They clean up the crumbs
so I don't have to.

04:37.728 --> 04:39.889
Aha! Caught-cha!

04:39.948 --> 04:42.027
I know what you're talking about!

04:42.208 --> 04:44.076
I sincerely doubt that.

04:44.778 --> 04:47.591
You're talking about my bachelor party.

04:48.090 --> 04:50.553
You guys are so secretive!

04:50.946 --> 04:54.158
If I didn't tell you months
ago the exact date to throw it,

04:54.196 --> 04:56.504
I'd have no idea it was even happening.

04:56.911 --> 04:59.111
Is it happening!

04:59.112 --> 05:00.946
Yeah! It sure is!

05:00.947 --> 05:02.881
Um, when is it happening again?

05:02.882 --> 05:04.916
You guys are so funny.

05:04.917 --> 05:06.879
- You know it's tonight.
- Tonight?

05:07.636 --> 05:10.557
Yeah, Alan just flew to
Vegas for his bachelor party

05:10.558 --> 05:12.475
and I planned mine for the same time.

05:12.594 --> 05:14.978
They got Alan front row
tickets for Blue Man Group...

05:15.126 --> 05:17.117
which is weird because he's colorblind.

05:18.796 --> 05:20.763
I already told Alan

05:20.764 --> 05:22.798
that yours will be way better!

05:22.905 --> 05:24.613
I can't wait to see what it is! Yay!

05:24.614 --> 05:25.847
Yay!

05:25.848 --> 05:27.048
Yay!

05:27.049 --> 05:28.884
- It's gonna be so good!
- Whoo!

05:28.885 --> 05:31.224
We've got to come up with something
fast or he's gonna be devastated.

05:31.225 --> 05:33.645
And vengeful. When I
forgot his half birthday,

05:33.646 --> 05:34.906
he keyed my car.

05:36.732 --> 05:39.698
I don't know how to throw a gay bachelor
party. I mean, what do they even do there?

05:39.699 --> 05:41.499
I'm guessing we're gonna
need a lot of glitter.

05:41.500 --> 05:43.368
Oh, Gabi... hey!

05:43.427 --> 05:44.627
Question...

05:44.628 --> 05:47.821
Do you think you can bake me a
cake that looks like a guy's butt?

05:48.956 --> 05:51.237
Yeah, but are you sure that's
what you want for breakfast?

05:51.760 --> 05:53.936
It's not for me. It's for
Elliot's bachelor party tonight.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.337
Yeah. You got it.

05:55.338 --> 05:57.475
Uh, Yolanda, can I get
your advice on something?

05:58.015 --> 06:01.441
Sofia asked me not to go out with
her smoking-hot brother Benji...

06:01.442 --> 06:02.886
So I said I wouldn't ask him out.

06:02.887 --> 06:04.755
But then when she left
to go to her fake job...

06:04.756 --> 06:06.906
He asked me out. So that's like...

06:06.907 --> 06:08.358
Totally cool, right?

06:09.018 --> 06:10.353
Yeah!

06:10.424 --> 06:12.257
There's no harm with going out with him

06:12.258 --> 06:13.542
one time.

06:13.674 --> 06:15.794
You gotta try it before you buy it.

06:15.795 --> 06:17.293
Hey!

06:17.645 --> 06:19.131
Can I try it four times?

06:19.132 --> 06:20.499
Hey!

06:25.173 --> 06:27.041
Yes! All right, we have a venue.

06:27.075 --> 06:29.944
I asked the manager of Alan's karaoke bar
and she said we could use it for tonight.

06:29.978 --> 06:33.204
Oh, that's great! And I made a ton of
appetizers, all from this cool blog...

06:33.205 --> 06:34.738
Natashaskitchen.Com.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.495
You should be paying her.

06:36.496 --> 06:38.394
Nope. Too far. Don't do
that. Keeping paying me.

06:40.214 --> 06:43.616
Oh! Hi, mister "about
to change his last name,

06:43.617 --> 06:46.929
or maybe not, I don't know
how it works with the gays."

06:48.658 --> 06:51.682
Hey, miss "comes up with a
nickname for every occasion,

06:51.683 --> 06:53.502
and it's really irritating."

06:55.531 --> 06:57.944
Ooh, cute ring tone. How do I get that?

06:57.957 --> 07:01.597
You be gay and you have "Yo
Fellas," the gay dating app.

07:01.598 --> 07:03.432
It alerts you when there's a match nearby.

07:03.433 --> 07:06.301
Wait, why do you have Yo Fellas?
You are still getting married, right?

07:06.302 --> 07:08.610
I mean, Yolanda and I have been
planning your bachelor party all morn...

07:08.611 --> 07:09.811
...th.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.705
Yes, the wedding's on.

07:12.706 --> 07:14.574
I just haven't deleted the app.

07:14.575 --> 07:17.779
It's not like I meet anyone.
It's just nice to know I could.

07:17.786 --> 07:20.857
It's like car insurance. You never
use it, but it gives you peace of mind.

07:21.232 --> 07:24.190
But I don't have car insurance
and I still have peace of mind.

07:27.479 --> 07:29.646
It's the building's plumber.

07:29.647 --> 07:31.415
He ain't getting anywhere near my pipes.

07:37.544 --> 07:38.917
Hi. I'm here for Gabi.

07:39.897 --> 07:41.097
She died.

07:43.420 --> 07:44.637
I'm Yolanda.

07:45.482 --> 07:48.677
- Hey, Benji. Wow, you look great.
- Thanks.

07:48.678 --> 07:50.488
But nobody's gonna look at
me when I'm walking with you.

07:50.489 --> 07:51.790
Oh...

07:51.791 --> 07:54.626
Why don't you go push the elevator
button, I'm gonna grab my purse.

07:57.035 --> 07:59.089
Okay, I don't have to
try him before I buy him.

07:59.090 --> 08:01.170
He's amazing. What am I gonna do?

08:01.345 --> 08:03.167
Get yourself a new best friend.

08:04.636 --> 08:06.804
'Cause he is fine!

08:16.559 --> 08:19.305
Damn! Yo Fellas is blowing up tonight.

08:20.109 --> 08:21.809
So glad I moved to San Francisco.

08:24.146 --> 08:26.202
Oh, hey! Sexy outfit.

08:26.203 --> 08:29.004
Oh, thanks. I forgot I had
it. It was hiding in my closet.

08:40.573 --> 08:42.674
Josh, are you sure about this decor?

08:42.710 --> 08:45.212
Don't you think it's too
formal for a bachelor party?

08:45.246 --> 08:48.453
Uh, trust me. Elliot's
gonna love "black tie only".

08:49.849 --> 08:52.180
Oh! They're the ones

08:52.181 --> 08:53.846
wearing the black tie!

08:54.830 --> 08:56.096
Nice touch!

08:56.368 --> 08:58.666
Speaking of which... Am I allowed to?

09:00.586 --> 09:02.820
- I don't believe this!
- What?

09:02.821 --> 09:04.327
We got another "no."

09:04.368 --> 09:06.129
Sam, no. Bruce, no.

09:06.130 --> 09:08.231
No. No. No.

09:08.232 --> 09:09.651
What are we gonna do?

09:09.879 --> 09:11.900
Give Elliot a better personality?

09:11.967 --> 09:14.538
No, we waited until the last
minute and now no one can come.

09:14.868 --> 09:16.948
Elliot's gonna know this
was our fault that we forgot

09:16.949 --> 09:20.001
and it's gonna take more than a Channing
Tatum ice sculpture to cheer him up.

09:21.442 --> 09:23.456
I got an idea. Give me your phone.

09:26.342 --> 09:29.250
Congratulations, you're on Yo Fellas.

09:30.243 --> 09:31.443
What?

09:31.444 --> 09:33.657
I'm making a Yo Fellas profile

09:33.658 --> 09:37.281
with your photo and alerting
every gay man on there,

09:37.282 --> 09:39.802
that you're throwing a
party with free booze.

09:39.803 --> 09:41.680
Uh, no. No, no, you're not.

09:42.394 --> 09:43.594
Then you tell Elliot

09:43.595 --> 09:46.055
that we screwed up and no
one's coming to his party.

09:48.053 --> 09:49.253
Get a couple of me shirtless.

09:49.254 --> 09:50.721
Mm-hmm. I thought so.

09:52.618 --> 09:53.818
Bam!

09:54.820 --> 09:56.021
Oh!

09:59.277 --> 10:00.477
Sofia?

10:01.392 --> 10:02.592
Hello?

10:04.574 --> 10:07.098
She must still be at
her very important job.

10:07.395 --> 10:08.595
Rats!

10:08.596 --> 10:10.530
Thank you so much for
coming with me tonight.

10:10.531 --> 10:12.508
Oh, for you anything.

10:12.509 --> 10:13.888
I'm thirsty.

10:14.159 --> 10:15.421
You want a water?

10:15.422 --> 10:17.624
Uh... you sure you don't
want something stronger,

10:17.625 --> 10:21.178
so you can get drunk and make bad decisions
and become the best politician ever?

10:22.123 --> 10:24.279
You're still so funny!

10:25.867 --> 10:27.067
To be honest...

10:27.068 --> 10:28.829
You were the first girl
I ever had a crush on.

10:28.830 --> 10:30.206
Really?

10:30.281 --> 10:31.481
And the last.

10:31.846 --> 10:33.858
Because Gabi...

10:34.844 --> 10:36.471
there's something I have to tell you.

10:36.472 --> 10:39.129
Oh, there's something
I have to tell you, too!

10:40.301 --> 10:42.035
What the hell?

10:42.148 --> 10:45.149
I come home from a day of
mergers and acquisitions

10:45.150 --> 10:47.284
to find you merging with my brother?

10:48.304 --> 10:51.193
Well, I... I was choking and
Benji was giving me mouth-to-mouth!

10:51.194 --> 10:52.394
That's not what you do for choking!

10:52.395 --> 10:53.895
That's not what you do for choking!

10:55.187 --> 10:58.405
I can't believe... Gabi, I told
you not to go out with my brother...

10:58.406 --> 11:00.087
and you do the exact opposite.

11:00.088 --> 11:03.757
Actually, you told me not to ask
him out and he asked me out, so...

11:03.758 --> 11:05.492
- So... it's the same thing!
- Is it?

11:05.493 --> 11:06.907
Uh, yes!

11:07.065 --> 11:08.774
Just because you found this loophole,

11:08.775 --> 11:10.445
doesn't mean you can go behind my back

11:10.446 --> 11:12.305
and date my brother. It's not okay.

11:12.306 --> 11:13.514
Seriously, Sofia...

11:13.515 --> 11:15.737
- It's not what you think!
- Okay, then what is it?

11:16.492 --> 11:18.057
Uh...

11:18.738 --> 11:20.038
You know what?

11:20.212 --> 11:21.413
This is stressing me out.

11:22.586 --> 11:24.261
Is there a donut shop around here?

11:26.036 --> 11:27.490
I... I can't believe you.

11:27.518 --> 11:29.759
Seriously, Sofia, I don't
understand what your problem is.

11:29.760 --> 11:32.676
I mean, if I met Benji at a bar...
you'd totally tell me to go for it.

11:32.677 --> 11:33.895
I mean, he's hot...

11:33.896 --> 11:37.211
- He smells good, and I want to bite his...
- Ah-la-la-la-la!

11:37.212 --> 11:38.712
See! See, it's happening already.

11:38.713 --> 11:41.281
This is exactly what I
didn't want to hear, Gabi.

11:41.282 --> 11:44.085
We share everything and I don't
want to hear about my brother's...

11:44.086 --> 11:45.286
everything.

11:45.418 --> 11:47.674
Well, I'm not gonna tell you everything.

11:47.675 --> 11:50.142
I promise, except I think he's so hot!

11:50.305 --> 11:52.679
God, Gabi, with you everybody's the one.

11:52.680 --> 11:54.425
Josh is the one, Cooper's the one.

11:54.426 --> 11:56.319
- Now Benji is the one?
- So you see it, too?

11:57.400 --> 11:59.101
- Oh, my God!
- Well...

11:59.143 --> 12:00.976
why else would he come back into my life

12:00.977 --> 12:02.251
after all of these years?

12:02.252 --> 12:04.272
- To visit his sister!
- Nah!

12:04.273 --> 12:07.240
Seriously, Gabi, you screw up
every single relationship you're in.

12:07.241 --> 12:08.601
Are you willing to screw up ours?

12:08.602 --> 12:10.526
Really? You think me dating
your brother is gonna screw up

12:10.527 --> 12:11.784
- our relationship?
- Yes!

12:11.785 --> 12:14.391
Well, I think it's time
we test that theory out!

12:25.008 --> 12:27.922
Wow! This is going better than I expected!

12:27.923 --> 12:30.880
Yeah! I can really pack 'em in!

12:31.218 --> 12:32.752
Be careful how loud you say that.

12:35.853 --> 12:37.883
Check out all these hotties.

12:37.927 --> 12:41.557
This is the best party ever!

12:42.780 --> 12:44.181
But it's weird...

12:44.215 --> 12:45.943
I haven't seen any of my friends.

12:46.623 --> 12:49.310
No, th-they're here. You
know, th-they're around.

12:49.482 --> 12:53.398
Yeah, no one wanted to miss the
chance to party with San Francisco's...

12:53.399 --> 12:55.066
sexiest bachelor.

12:55.067 --> 12:57.598
No, they didn't.

12:57.678 --> 12:59.145
Now if you'll excuse me...

12:59.146 --> 13:00.976
Mama needs a stiff one...

13:01.294 --> 13:02.494
and a drink!

13:05.052 --> 13:06.620
Oh! Yolanda...

13:06.621 --> 13:08.543
- there you are!
- Gabi, what are you doing here?

13:08.544 --> 13:10.643
I really need to talk to
you. I need your advice again.

13:10.644 --> 13:13.645
Sofia and I got in a huge fight
about me going out with Benji,

13:13.646 --> 13:15.856
because she thinks it's
gonna ruin our friendship.

13:15.857 --> 13:18.893
And I really don't think that's fair
because I think Benji could be the one!

13:18.950 --> 13:20.584
That's a shame!

13:20.585 --> 13:21.785
Why?

13:35.353 --> 13:37.387
- Benji.
- Gabi?

13:42.400 --> 13:43.895
What's going on?

13:44.575 --> 13:46.503
- I'm gay.
- I gathered.

13:47.472 --> 13:49.540
I tried telling you earlier,
but it was really hard

13:49.541 --> 13:51.277
and somehow I guess I led you on.

13:51.523 --> 13:53.386
By inviting me on a date!

13:53.387 --> 13:54.872
I never called it a "date."

13:54.873 --> 13:56.391
I called it a "wanna come with me?"

13:57.560 --> 13:59.695
Oh, yeah! I don't know how
that could be confusing.

14:00.411 --> 14:02.959
It was my first work party
and I didn't know anyone.

14:02.960 --> 14:05.035
I wanted to go with someone
I was comfortable with.

14:05.036 --> 14:06.343
You're like a big sister to me.

14:06.344 --> 14:08.586
Oh, yeah. This just keeps
getting better and better.

14:08.996 --> 14:10.196
Gabi...

14:10.197 --> 14:11.997
I'm sorry I gave you the wrong impression.

14:11.998 --> 14:13.798
I'm just not out to anyone yet.

14:13.799 --> 14:16.805
It's not easy. We were
raised strict catholics.

14:16.806 --> 14:18.055
Sofia's still a virgin.

14:20.232 --> 14:22.079
Yeah, well, ah...

14:22.080 --> 14:24.284
So many secrets in this family.

14:24.691 --> 14:26.291
You know what? You're right...

14:26.292 --> 14:27.559
and I'm sick of them!

14:27.560 --> 14:29.027
I'm telling Sofia tonight.

14:29.028 --> 14:30.896
As... as you should.

14:30.921 --> 14:33.342
Ah... but right after I
tell her that my friendship

14:33.343 --> 14:35.418
with her is more important than you.

14:35.618 --> 14:38.117
- Ouch!
- Oh, come on. Don't be so hurt.

14:38.118 --> 14:40.150
Okay? You just called me
your big sister when...

14:40.242 --> 14:41.761
you're the big sister.

14:41.911 --> 14:43.452
Gabi, come on!

14:43.453 --> 14:45.570
Now that it's out. I
want my sister to know.

14:45.571 --> 14:47.038
I mean, I can't wait any longer.

14:47.039 --> 14:48.267
Really, Benji?

14:48.268 --> 14:50.188
Because you know, up until this very moment

14:50.189 --> 14:51.654
you were so far in the closet...

14:51.689 --> 14:53.056
You were in Narnia.

15:03.021 --> 15:04.221
Hey!

15:05.827 --> 15:07.220
What happened?

15:07.373 --> 15:10.308
Well, I was running from
donut shop to donut shop

15:10.309 --> 15:12.516
trying to find Benji, you
know, when it hit me...

15:12.569 --> 15:14.523
It doesn't matter if he's the one.

15:14.524 --> 15:15.724
Who cares about that?

15:15.725 --> 15:18.061
You know what does matter?
You. You're the one. Boop!

15:19.457 --> 15:21.119
Yeah, I'm not really feeling the hug yet.

15:21.549 --> 15:23.725
Aren't ya? 'Cause I am. Boop.

15:26.077 --> 15:27.277
What's going on?

15:27.278 --> 15:28.884
What's going on is I love you.

15:28.885 --> 15:32.081
Okay? And I would never let a
guy jeopardize our friendship.

15:32.082 --> 15:34.611
And let's face it, you know,
he's gonna get fat again.

15:34.906 --> 15:36.170
Gabi...

15:36.688 --> 15:38.271
Have you told Benji yet?

15:38.272 --> 15:40.472
I have. Yeah. And it was seriously...

15:40.487 --> 15:42.337
one of the hardest things
I've ever had to do.

15:42.338 --> 15:44.001
But, you know, I had
to be straight with him.

15:44.002 --> 15:47.021
I just wish he would've been straight
for me... with me. It was hard.

15:48.936 --> 15:50.885
Well, thank you. I've... I really feel

15:50.886 --> 15:53.595
like you heard me and respected
me and I appreciate that.

15:53.596 --> 15:55.791
- I will now accept that hug.
- Oh, yay.

15:55.807 --> 15:57.135
You know, it's a good thing that

15:57.136 --> 15:59.045
Benji is sweet and
smart and good looking...

15:59.046 --> 16:01.094
- He'll find another girl.
- Ah, he won't...

16:01.229 --> 16:03.403
...be alone for long.

16:05.893 --> 16:07.794
- Hey!
- Oh, hey, Benji.

16:08.634 --> 16:12.036
So, did you tell you chose her over me?

16:12.037 --> 16:14.801
I did. Barely. You're
cutting it a little close.

16:15.681 --> 16:17.158
Are you okay?

16:17.539 --> 16:19.907
I'm surprisingly okay.

16:20.931 --> 16:22.270
But let's sit down.

16:22.734 --> 16:23.934
I have something to tell you.

16:23.935 --> 16:25.135
What?

16:25.136 --> 16:26.681
Oh, my God. What is it? You're scaring me.

16:26.682 --> 16:27.882
Are mom and dad okay?

16:27.883 --> 16:29.132
For now.

16:31.471 --> 16:33.310
But wait until I tell them I'm gay.

16:33.918 --> 16:35.151
What?

16:36.539 --> 16:39.151
Oh, my God! I did not see that one coming!

16:39.152 --> 16:41.119
This is a shock-a-roon-ey.

16:42.921 --> 16:44.249
Is it, Gabi?

16:44.250 --> 16:47.041
Or did you find out he was
gay, realized he wasn't the one,

16:47.042 --> 16:48.659
rushed over here to tell me I'm the one

16:48.660 --> 16:51.444
before he came out to me, so you'd look
like a good friend and I wouldn't get mad?

16:51.445 --> 16:52.678
What?

16:54.052 --> 16:57.060
Clearly, the shock of
his brand-new gayness

16:57.061 --> 16:59.322
has caused you to doubt my sincerity.

17:00.341 --> 17:02.062
But I see three's a
lot going on here, okay?

17:02.063 --> 17:03.473
So I'm gonna give you two a moment.

17:05.288 --> 17:07.112
So... you're gay?

17:07.637 --> 17:08.914
I am.

17:09.406 --> 17:12.228
Wow. When did... when did... w...

17:12.229 --> 17:13.797
wow!

17:14.259 --> 17:16.086
I'm sorry it came out so fast...

17:16.518 --> 17:17.718
Unlike me.

17:18.941 --> 17:21.965
Look, I know you're shocked. I
just didn't know how to tell you.

17:22.029 --> 17:23.630
You want to know something weird?

17:23.631 --> 17:25.165
I'm not that shocked.

17:25.366 --> 17:27.301
You know, it's all sort
of making sense now.

17:27.303 --> 17:28.941
Like when you locked yourself in your room

17:28.942 --> 17:31.919
because dad wouldn't let you watch the
season finale of <i>Project Runway</i>.

17:32.041 --> 17:34.293
Who do you think called
Child Protective Services?

17:35.981 --> 17:38.664
I just didn't tell you because
I didn't want you to reject me.

17:38.665 --> 17:41.357
Oh, shut up. You're my
brother and I love you.

17:41.358 --> 17:43.693
You shut up! I love you, too.

17:45.137 --> 17:46.337
Aw!

17:46.338 --> 17:47.744
So everything's good?

17:47.745 --> 17:49.404
You guys talked about everything?

17:49.405 --> 17:51.632
- We did.
- So he's cool with you not having a job?

17:51.633 --> 17:52.709
- What?
- Gabi!

17:52.710 --> 17:55.310
Uh, at least I didn't tell
him you're not a virgin.

17:55.311 --> 17:58.363
- What?
- Okay, I'm gonna give you a moment.

18:06.343 --> 18:08.081
Have I had a little
bit too much to drink...

18:08.082 --> 18:09.916
or are none of my friends here?

18:10.917 --> 18:13.050
They're here. You're
just too short to see 'em.

18:14.153 --> 18:16.587
You're right. Maybe I can't see them...

18:16.588 --> 18:18.166
but I can see this.

18:18.501 --> 18:21.438
That's right. I got the Yo
Fellas alert about the party.

18:21.439 --> 18:22.673
My party!

18:22.674 --> 18:24.414
I can explain...

18:24.758 --> 18:25.958
Tell him, Josh.

18:28.017 --> 18:29.217
Elliot...

18:29.456 --> 18:31.157
you're an amazing guy...

18:31.161 --> 18:34.349
And an unbelievable publicist,

18:34.350 --> 18:37.209
who happened to drop the ball by not
reminding me about his bachelor party.

18:37.311 --> 18:39.191
- You're blaming me for this?
- I was trying.

18:40.017 --> 18:42.811
So you thought throwing together
a last-minute bachelor party

18:42.812 --> 18:44.174
with a ton of balloons,

18:44.175 --> 18:46.940
and a bunch of drunk,
half-naked bow-tied strangers

18:46.941 --> 18:50.097
dancing all over the place would
make up for the fact that you forgot?

18:51.235 --> 18:53.701
Well, it did!

18:53.958 --> 18:55.995
This is the best night of my life!

18:55.996 --> 18:57.863
Yay!

18:57.966 --> 18:59.433
I'm glad you enjoyed it, buddy.

18:59.434 --> 19:01.269
You're worth it. Right, Yolanda?

19:01.349 --> 19:02.549
Huh?

19:02.550 --> 19:04.533
Oh, yeah. Happy Birthday, baby.

19:07.851 --> 19:09.151
Attention!

19:09.152 --> 19:10.754
Attention beautiful strangers,

19:10.755 --> 19:13.467
who normally would never
give me the time of day.

19:13.850 --> 19:16.712
Even though Yo Fellas is what
brought us all together...

19:16.713 --> 19:19.103
For me it ends tonight!

19:19.329 --> 19:21.341
I have two great friends

19:21.507 --> 19:23.753
and an amazing fiance.

19:23.754 --> 19:25.963
I don't need a security blanket anymore.

19:25.964 --> 19:28.432
I've decided to make
the ultimate sacrifice...

19:28.571 --> 19:30.255
Deleting Yo Fellas.

19:31.612 --> 19:34.047
Elliot Park is officially off the market.

19:37.830 --> 19:40.809
Hey, Elliot, ah, meet
Benji, Sofia's brother.

19:40.810 --> 19:42.852
He just came out of the closet.

19:43.058 --> 19:45.126
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. That's your news.

19:45.379 --> 19:47.062
I'm just so proud.

19:47.063 --> 19:48.831
Wow! Congrats.

19:48.880 --> 19:50.227
Did you hear my speech?

19:50.228 --> 19:53.036
- No, sorry. I missed it.
- Perfect. Let's dance.

19:56.514 --> 19:57.913
Take off your shirt!

19:59.876 --> 20:01.720
You know, I think it's
great you guys are gonna

20:01.721 --> 20:03.493
tell your parents the
truth about your lives.

20:03.494 --> 20:04.861
What if I tell them about me

20:04.895 --> 20:06.712
and they never let me come home?

20:06.897 --> 20:09.398
What if I tell them about me
and they want me to move home?

20:09.433 --> 20:11.801
You guys, you're looking at this all wrong.

20:11.836 --> 20:13.736
When they find out that Sofia's jobless...

20:13.737 --> 20:15.632
they won't care that you're gay.

20:15.633 --> 20:17.019
You know, when they find out you're gay...

20:17.020 --> 20:18.707
