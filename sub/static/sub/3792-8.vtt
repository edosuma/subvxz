01:18.287 --> 01:20.204
Not a bad neighborhood, E.

01:20.289 --> 01:22.623
And you're relatively close
to the House of Wax.

01:22.708 --> 01:24.542
You got a Jiffy Lube
right across the street.

01:24.626 --> 01:25.877
And if you had a hard day,

01:25.961 --> 01:28.087
you're only a few
steps away from a $50 blowjob.

01:28.172 --> 01:30.882
Please, we passed $50 10 blocks ago.

01:30.966 --> 01:33.092
What do you need an office for anyway?
I don't get it.

01:33.177 --> 01:35.678
You didn't get the concept of having
a job till you were 25, Turtle,

01:35.763 --> 01:37.054
so I wouldn't expect you to.

01:37.139 --> 01:38.806
If it's my place that's
not doing it for you, E,

01:38.891 --> 01:40.266
we can make some modifications,

01:40.350 --> 01:42.101
make the environment
more work-friendly.

01:42.186 --> 01:43.978
I appreciate that, Drama.
The only modification

01:44.062 --> 01:45.730
that would work would be
having you guys move out.

01:45.814 --> 01:47.023
Why, are we distracting?

01:47.107 --> 01:48.775
No, having Turtle
blow bong hits in my face

01:48.859 --> 01:51.360
when I'm trying to read
a script is motivating.

01:51.945 --> 01:55.198
- This is the building?
- Shut up and get in there.

01:57.576 --> 01:59.035
Jesus Christ.
What the hell?

01:59.119 --> 02:00.620
I guess you don't like it?

02:00.704 --> 02:02.121
Well, it doesn't exactly scream

02:02.206 --> 02:03.956
"I'm Vincent Chase's manager. "

02:04.041 --> 02:05.792
No. It screams "I'm Johnny Chase's. "

02:05.876 --> 02:07.919
Why do I gotta get abused

02:08.002 --> 02:09.127
when we're trying to abuse him?

02:09.213 --> 02:10.713
It's just for a laugh.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.715
- This is gonna be your desk?
- Yeah, for now.

02:13.217 --> 02:15.510
No no no.
A working man needs a real desk,

02:15.594 --> 02:16.886
a sturdy desk.

02:17.095 --> 02:18.471
One that can support a good fuck.

02:18.555 --> 02:20.932
Well, this office isn't for show.

02:21.016 --> 02:23.643
And it's not for fucking.
It's so I can get shit done.

02:23.727 --> 02:24.811
Like what?

02:24.895 --> 02:25.978
Yeah, what do you got
to do that's so pressing?

02:26.063 --> 02:28.189
I am kind of booked till
Walsh hands in his script.

02:28.273 --> 02:30.441
So what do you want to do?
You want to sit around and do nothing?

02:30.526 --> 02:31.901
You have something else in mind?

02:31.985 --> 02:34.237
Peter Jackson's starting
a new gaming division.

02:34.404 --> 02:37.323
They're looking to make some talent
deals... Big dough, limited exposure.

02:37.407 --> 02:39.033
I'm gonna call his development
guy and set up a meeting.

02:39.117 --> 02:40.910
Maybe I can
lock us a video game. Sound good?

02:40.994 --> 02:42.203
- Sounds great.
- Yeah?

02:42.287 --> 02:44.080
- The office still sucks.
Yeah, it's terrible.

02:44.248 --> 02:46.707
Come on, guys.
Let's leave my high-powered manager

02:46.792 --> 02:48.292
so he can earn us some money.

02:48.377 --> 02:50.378
- Later, E.
- What are we gonna do all day?

02:50.462 --> 02:52.255
We'll figure it out.

02:56.093 --> 02:57.718
Big day today, people!

02:57.803 --> 02:59.512
The Gold standard's golden girl,

02:59.596 --> 03:01.848
Miss Mary J. Blige,

03:01.932 --> 03:04.058
is coming in today for her annual

03:04.142 --> 03:06.853
"make-me-understand-
what-I-pay-you-people-for"

03:06.937 --> 03:08.855
meeting, so we'd better be ready.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.439
- Chris!
- Uh, I'm ready, Ari.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.066
- Bradley!
- Wearing my best tie, Ari.

03:12.150 --> 03:14.235
Great, zip up that fly.

03:14.319 --> 03:15.444
- Ari...
- Hey, Jim.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.488
- It's Jeff.
- I'm sorry. From the side, you know...

03:17.573 --> 03:19.699
- Yeah, don't worry about it.
- You and your bro ready for Mary J?

03:19.783 --> 03:22.285
We are. But listen, just a heads up:

03:22.369 --> 03:24.078
My brother and I have been
having some personal problems.

03:24.162 --> 03:25.204
Does it have anything
to do with Mary J?

03:25.289 --> 03:26.372
No, it does not.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.749
- Then it has nothing to do with me.
- You're absolutely right.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.835
But you know how
emotional Jim can be.

03:30.919 --> 03:33.546
So, look, if he comes bugging you with
this, just ignore him.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.131
Let's hope he
doesn't come bugging me.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.883
Yeah. Let's hope.

03:39.803 --> 03:41.012
Did Mary J. Confirm?

03:41.096 --> 03:43.431
Six times, one for each Grammy.

03:43.515 --> 03:45.975
- What's that smell?
- It's Issey Miyake, her favorite scent.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.769
I'm wearing it as a subtle
subliminal show of our support.

03:48.854 --> 03:51.022
- What else you got?
- Jim Jensen's in your office.

03:51.106 --> 03:53.733
Oh, Jesus Christ,
his brother just ambushed me.

03:53.817 --> 03:56.110
Yeah, I guess there's some kind of
rift with the Jensen boys.

03:56.194 --> 03:57.778
- Be careful in there.
- Careful?

03:57.863 --> 03:59.405
You know multiples freak me out, Ari.

03:59.489 --> 04:00.948
Can gays have multiples, Lloyd?

04:01.033 --> 04:02.825
Jim! Not the day for this.

04:02.910 --> 04:03.951
How's it going with the baby bro?

04:04.036 --> 04:06.412
Okay, he's 27 seconds
older than me, Ari.

04:06.496 --> 04:08.915
And he's a lowlife
slimy piece of cunt shit.

04:08.999 --> 04:11.167
Yes, well, you know
how siblings can be, right?

04:11.251 --> 04:12.752
- Oh, you have a brother?
- I do.

04:12.836 --> 04:15.588
And a whore of a sister, so I can
relate to the sibling squabblings.

04:15.839 --> 04:17.298
I need you to fire him, Ari.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.800
I need positivity today, Jim.

04:19.885 --> 04:22.511
But, Ari, I can't work
in the same building with him.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.972
Jeter and A-Rod let their dicks
fly in the same locker room

04:25.057 --> 04:26.557
- and they hate each other.
- Okay, Ari...

04:26.642 --> 04:28.267
Jim, listen to me.

04:28.352 --> 04:30.061
Just man the fuck up, okay?

04:30.145 --> 04:31.979
We got Mary J. Coming in today.

04:32.064 --> 04:35.524
It's time to heed
the woman's lyrics... "No More Drama. "

04:37.235 --> 04:39.904
- Matt Dravitzki's on the phone.
- Who's Matt Dravitzki?

04:39.988 --> 04:41.697
VP of Peter Jackson's company.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.449
Do I talk to VPs?

04:43.533 --> 04:45.284
He says he's calling
because E called him

04:45.369 --> 04:47.620
and said Vince wants
to work with Peter.

04:48.372 --> 04:50.164
Jim, go back to work.

04:51.083 --> 04:52.124
Go.

04:54.211 --> 04:57.296
And don't ask to see her tatts
like you did with Angelina.

04:58.382 --> 04:59.882
Hello.

04:59.967 --> 05:02.093
Ooh, look at this sweet piece, Vince.

05:02.177 --> 05:03.636
It's perfect. E will love it.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.554
Can I go on record and say
that when I get an office

05:05.639 --> 05:07.223
I want my gift to be a plasma?

05:07.307 --> 05:09.600
Can I go on the record
and say by the time you get an office,

05:09.685 --> 05:11.852
plasmas will have gone
the way of the eight-track?

05:11.937 --> 05:14.146
Excuse me, miss.

05:14.231 --> 05:16.232
Can you tell me a little
something about this desk?

05:16.316 --> 05:18.818
Oh, that's an amazing piece
with a lot of history.

05:18.902 --> 05:21.529
- You've got a good eye.
- Well, thank you.

05:21.613 --> 05:24.740
Do you know what
kind of weight this can support?

05:24.950 --> 05:27.910
This is a signed Majorelle
built in the 1930s.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.746
Mickey Rooney sat at this desk
in "Breakfast at Tiffany's. "

05:30.831 --> 05:32.540
- Mmm.
- Huh, that's ironic.

05:32.624 --> 05:35.001
We want it so another
small Irishman can sit at it.

05:35.085 --> 05:36.961
Oh, is this a gift?
- Yeah.

05:37.254 --> 05:39.171
That's very thoughtful.

05:39.256 --> 05:40.339
How thoughtful?

05:40.424 --> 05:41.632
$42,000.

05:42.426 --> 05:45.428
Get a 100-inch
plasma for that, Vin.

05:45.512 --> 05:46.804
This is an investment, though.

05:46.888 --> 05:49.265
This desk will appreciate
like a piece of art.

05:49.433 --> 05:51.267
And Robert De Niro owned that desk.

05:51.560 --> 05:52.560
Really?

05:52.644 --> 05:54.562
Yeah, Scorsese gave it to him as a gift

05:54.646 --> 05:56.397
after "New York, New York" bombed.

05:56.481 --> 05:58.357
It was the only thing that survived

05:58.442 --> 06:00.860
after his Malibu home
went up in flames.

06:00.944 --> 06:03.696
- Is this true?
- Cross my heart and hope to die.

06:03.905 --> 06:04.947
Hmm.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.283
I'm sold.

06:10.328 --> 06:12.955
I wonder if De Niro
ever fucked on this desk.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.165
Hmm, I don't know, Drama.

06:14.249 --> 06:16.751
Why don't you lean over
and sniff it for ball wax?

06:17.127 --> 06:19.045
Turtle, come on.
You have to ruin the desk for me?

06:19.129 --> 06:21.547
- I'm sorry, Vin.
- Vince, I am so embarrassed,

06:21.631 --> 06:23.340
but apparently a buyer
came in yesterday

06:23.425 --> 06:25.551
and someone forgot to put
the sold tag out.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.970
- You're kidding?
- I feel awful.

06:28.513 --> 06:30.181
We have another great desk
that just came in.

06:30.265 --> 06:31.724
It's a rustic piece.

06:31.808 --> 06:34.894
- Yeah, De Niro own that one?
- I'm really sorry.

06:35.312 --> 06:36.604
Is there any way
we can call the buyer

06:36.688 --> 06:38.230
and maybe offer him
a little more?

06:38.315 --> 06:40.900
- We really want the desk.
- I'm sorry, I couldn't.

06:40.984 --> 06:43.444
We're supposed to respect
the privacy of our clients.

06:43.528 --> 06:44.945
Can you respect my poor little friend

06:45.030 --> 06:47.323
sitting at a fold-up table
in his sad little office?

06:50.160 --> 06:52.411
It was Gary Busey.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.251
Hey.

07:04.216 --> 07:05.341
Shit!

07:06.843 --> 07:07.802
Eric Murphy.

07:07.886 --> 07:09.261
Like the new office number, E.

07:09.346 --> 07:11.472
You know it spells 274-COCK.

07:12.224 --> 07:14.308
- It does not.
- No, it doesn't, but I made you look.

07:14.392 --> 07:15.810
Why are you so out of breath?

07:15.894 --> 07:18.062
Are you christening the place
with a nice midday jerk?

07:18.146 --> 07:19.772
Stop fantasizing, Ari.
What do you want?

07:19.856 --> 07:21.524
You call Peter Jackson's company?

07:21.608 --> 07:23.442
- Yeah, how'd you know?
- 'Cause they called me.

07:23.527 --> 07:24.610
Why'd they call you?

07:24.694 --> 07:26.612
Because they don't know
who the fuck you are.

07:26.696 --> 07:28.739
I told them I was
Vincent Chase's manager.

07:28.824 --> 07:30.741
Well, there are people
outside your office right now

07:30.826 --> 07:33.285
that will claim to be Lady Di.
That don't make it true.

07:33.370 --> 07:35.121
Whatever. This is true, you jerk-off.

07:35.205 --> 07:37.206
Your staff is ready, Ari.

07:37.374 --> 07:39.583
Listen, we got a great system going.

07:39.668 --> 07:41.752
Just 'cause you got
80 square feet of office space

07:41.837 --> 07:43.295
doesn't mean you can go
and fuck it up.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.631
And what system is that, Ari?
Just so I'm clear.

07:45.715 --> 07:47.716
Well, let's see, people call me,

07:47.801 --> 07:50.928
then I call you.
You tell Vince what I tell you.

07:51.012 --> 07:53.347
Vince tells you what to tell me.

07:53.431 --> 07:56.559
You're like a...
A ventriloquist in a dummy's body.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.644
Whatever. I can make
and take my own meetings.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.896
Well, listen, if you want
people to call you back,

08:00.981 --> 08:02.773
may I suggest that you get a van

08:02.858 --> 08:04.859
with a large bullhorn on the top,

08:04.943 --> 08:06.485
drive around Hollywood

08:06.570 --> 08:09.905
announcing that after three years
of hibernating in Vincent Chase's ass,

08:09.990 --> 08:12.616
Eric Murphy has come
out to play-ee-ay?

08:13.160 --> 08:14.827
All right! Let's do this, everybody!

08:14.911 --> 08:16.996
- Everyone feeling good?
Yes! Yeah! Great!

08:17.080 --> 08:18.539
Not everyone.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.542
All right!

08:21.751 --> 08:25.004
I am not Ari Gold today,
I am the queen of hip-hop soul.

08:25.088 --> 08:27.506
I have sold 65 million more records

08:27.632 --> 08:29.133
than all of you combined.

08:29.217 --> 08:31.468
Impress me. Go.

08:31.595 --> 08:34.179
A broadway musical based
on her alter ego Brook Lynn.

08:34.264 --> 08:37.099
Miss Blige could produce,
star and direct.

08:37.183 --> 08:40.394
Uh, so you want to keep her
on the stage for nine months

08:40.477 --> 08:41.854
and out of the recording studio?

08:41.938 --> 08:43.480
It's a really good idea.

08:43.565 --> 08:45.608
Mention that to her
and I'll kill both of you.

08:45.692 --> 08:46.859
ARl: Next.

08:46.943 --> 08:49.153
Paramount has a movie
about con artists.

08:49.237 --> 08:51.530
It's an excellent script,
very realistic.

08:51.615 --> 08:54.283
Yeah, he'd know since
he's a pretty big con artist himself.

08:54.367 --> 08:55.743
You have something
productive to say?

08:55.827 --> 08:58.078
I'm sorry, Ari, I'm just
having trouble concentrating.

08:58.163 --> 09:00.331
- Well, Jim, this isn't the place.
- Oh, what?

09:00.415 --> 09:01.498
Am I embarrassing you?

09:01.583 --> 09:02.708
No, you're
embarrassing yourself.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.293
Actually, no one can tell
you two apart,

09:04.377 --> 09:05.586
so you're both being embarrassed.

09:05.670 --> 09:08.339
Ari, Ari, I told you,
I can't work with him.

09:08.423 --> 09:09.548
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna quit?

09:09.633 --> 09:11.175
No, I told him to fire you.

09:11.259 --> 09:13.010
- What?
- Yeah, that's right, scumbag.

09:13.094 --> 09:15.471
Okay, you know what?
I apologized to you.

09:15.555 --> 09:16.764
But when you go
after my livelihood...

09:16.848 --> 09:17.932
Hey, assholes!

09:18.016 --> 09:19.433
- Fuck your livelihood!
- Fuck you!

09:19.517 --> 09:20.976
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me?!

09:21.061 --> 09:23.479
You want some?

09:28.318 --> 09:30.152
Put them both in my office
when it's done.

09:30.237 --> 09:32.196
Remind me to sell this
as a reality show.

09:37.202 --> 09:38.827
Sounds too easy is all I'm saying.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.537
The guy said he'd be
happy to sell me the desk.

09:40.622 --> 09:42.915
Let's just
get in and out. No small talk.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.501
Busey scares me, Vin.
You sure there's not another desk?

09:45.585 --> 09:48.254
This is the desk we're getting, Turtle.
Just don't small talk, okay?

09:48.338 --> 09:49.755
Johnny?

09:49.839 --> 09:51.548
I like talking to Busey.

09:51.633 --> 09:54.093
The tortoise, the hare
and the millionaire.

09:54.177 --> 09:56.971
It is so good to see you guys.

09:57.514 --> 10:00.391
I've had walking pneumonia
for the past couple of weeks.

10:00.475 --> 10:02.142
Haven't had any guests.

10:02.227 --> 10:05.354
But for the beginning
of new guests, you are the best.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.232
Come on in.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.402
Come on. Come on.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.905
So, you've come to acquire
my newly-acquired desk.

10:14.990 --> 10:16.282
It's for E as a gift.

10:16.366 --> 10:17.908
Yeah, he's got a sweet new office

10:17.993 --> 10:20.703
and it'll complement
the place perfectly.

10:21.162 --> 10:23.247
There's no way
I'm gonna part with that desk.

10:23.331 --> 10:24.873
But, Gary, you said on the phone...

10:24.958 --> 10:27.876
That phone call was
two years ago, Mr. Vince.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.879
Gary, my brother is prepared to pay

10:30.964 --> 10:33.465
whatever he's got to pay
to get that desk. Name your price.

10:33.550 --> 10:34.758
Easy, Johnny, easy.

10:34.843 --> 10:36.302
Uh, yes, I am willing to pay, Gary,

10:36.386 --> 10:37.886
but let's be reasonable.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.180
You paid 42, I'll give you 50.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.683
Money will bury you, Vince.

10:42.767 --> 10:44.143
- Okay, all right.
- Here, sit down.

10:44.227 --> 10:46.603
Let's find harmony in this circle.

10:49.482 --> 10:50.816
Good.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.235
Why are you so quiet?

10:53.820 --> 10:55.070
You scare me, Gary.

10:55.405 --> 10:56.864
It's your reflection in the mirror

10:56.948 --> 10:58.532
that scares you, Turtle.

10:59.242 --> 11:00.784
Gary, what exactly do you want?

11:00.869 --> 11:02.328
I'm planning a series of portraits

11:02.412 --> 11:03.871
and I've chosen my next subject.

11:04.748 --> 11:07.791
- You want to paint me?
- No. You don't know pain.

11:07.876 --> 11:09.501
I... I don't follow.

11:09.586 --> 11:12.546
Drama, I've chosen you.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.632
You want to paint me?

11:16.426 --> 11:19.136
No, I want to paint on you.

11:20.305 --> 11:21.764
Now I don't follow.

11:22.432 --> 11:25.392
This is a statement
of enlightened photography:

11:25.852 --> 11:28.771
The unseen faces of the familiar.

11:29.105 --> 11:31.440
I painted George Hamilton white.

11:31.858 --> 11:34.818
I've taken 230 Ibs off Dom Deluise

11:34.903 --> 11:37.488
by painting him with vertical stripes.

11:38.823 --> 11:41.158
With you, I will paint you

11:41.242 --> 11:42.951
to bring out
your beauty and your truth.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.329
- Good luck.
- So what do you say, Johnny?

11:46.831 --> 11:48.707
I don't know, bro. I got tiny pores.

11:48.792 --> 11:51.168
- It could suffocate me.
- Hey!

11:51.252 --> 11:53.462
Only denial will suffocate you.

11:54.297 --> 11:57.633
- Come on, Drama. It's for E.
- It's for E.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.468
And for immortality.

12:01.471 --> 12:02.971
"Daily Variety" ad sales, can I help you?

12:03.056 --> 12:04.681
Hi. I'd like to take out an ad

12:04.766 --> 12:06.100
in tomorrow's paper
announcing my company.

12:06.184 --> 12:08.519
Okay, no problem.
I need the name of your business.

12:08.603 --> 12:11.897
The Murphy Group.

12:11.981 --> 12:13.524
Yeah, you like that?

12:14.275 --> 12:15.901
It's okay. What do you do?

12:15.985 --> 12:17.403
I represent Vincent Chase.

12:17.487 --> 12:19.071
Ooh! I liked "Aquaman. "

12:19.155 --> 12:21.115
- Cool.
- But according to the SAG database,

12:21.199 --> 12:23.117
Ari Gold represents Vincent Chase.

12:23.201 --> 12:24.618
Well, I'm his manager.

12:24.702 --> 12:27.538
Oh, that's nice.
Who else do you represent?

12:28.498 --> 12:31.041
- Just Vince.
- So why the "Group"?

12:31.126 --> 12:33.252
I thought it sounded good.
What, it doesn't?

12:33.336 --> 12:34.878
If there was a group it might.

12:34.963 --> 12:37.256
Well, whatever.
I'm gonna go with the Group.

12:37.340 --> 12:38.924
What do you want the ad to say?

12:39.759 --> 12:41.135
"The Murphy Group

12:41.219 --> 12:43.303
is proud to be
representing Vincent Chase. "

12:43.388 --> 12:45.389
Okay, but we need confirmation

12:45.473 --> 12:47.933
that you actually manage Vincent
Chase before we can use his name.

12:48.017 --> 12:50.602
- What kind of confirmation?
- Client management papers, perhaps.

12:50.687 --> 12:51.937
I don't have those.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.439
You represent Vincent Chase
with no papers?

12:53.523 --> 12:55.691
- Yes.
- Do you think that's smart?

12:56.860 --> 12:58.902
Look, what else can I do to confirm?

12:58.987 --> 13:02.948
You can have Ari Gold's office call us,
'cause we know who he is.

13:03.366 --> 13:04.533
Hello?

13:04.784 --> 13:06.368
Uh, look, whatever. You know what?

13:06.453 --> 13:09.371
I'll get some papers
or something, thank you.

13:10.081 --> 13:11.248
Freak.

13:15.837 --> 13:17.171
Hey, Ari!
- Shut the fuck up!

13:17.255 --> 13:19.131
I've heard enough out of both
of you today. Lloyd, go.

13:20.717 --> 13:22.676
You guys should've had
this out in the carpool in.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.804
We don't carpool, Ari.
We live on opposite sides of town.

13:25.889 --> 13:27.514
Really? 'Cause I would've
pictured you two

13:27.599 --> 13:30.517
living in the same condo together in,
like, bunk beds with a little racecar...

13:30.602 --> 13:33.437
- Ari...
- Shut up! Don't say another word!

13:33.521 --> 13:35.481
Pretend like you're
afraid of me, okay?

13:35.565 --> 13:37.483
Because I'm feeling
a little insecure right now,

13:37.567 --> 13:39.860
because I'm wondering
what I'm doing wrong

13:39.944 --> 13:42.779
that would allow you two
to fuck with my focus

13:42.947 --> 13:45.532
on a day when I need to be
on my A game.

13:45.617 --> 13:47.326
On a day, when, if I'm not,

13:47.410 --> 13:50.120
we could see M.J. Hip and hop her way

13:50.205 --> 13:51.705
back to I.C.M.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.957
And if that were to happen, best case,

13:54.042 --> 13:55.751
you two are managers in the Valley.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.503
Worst case, you're a freak show

13:57.587 --> 13:59.463
performing at the Santa Monica Pier.

13:59.714 --> 14:02.174
Now, with that in mind, tell me

14:02.592 --> 14:04.593
why in God's name

14:04.677 --> 14:06.428
is this happening?!

14:10.225 --> 14:12.100
He fucked my wife, Ari.

14:14.103 --> 14:15.437
He did not!

14:16.439 --> 14:17.856
You... You did?

14:17.941 --> 14:19.733
You fucked his wife?

14:22.237 --> 14:24.780
- As you?
- What?

14:25.031 --> 14:27.032
Did you pretend to be him?

14:27.116 --> 14:30.160
Or did she actually fuck you
thinking you were you?

14:30.245 --> 14:33.330
- You think this is funny?
- No! I think it's disgusting.

14:33.414 --> 14:35.582
I'm just... I'm trying to figure out

14:36.042 --> 14:37.209
why she did that.

14:37.293 --> 14:38.710
I mean, if I were to cheat on my wife

14:38.795 --> 14:40.712
it would be with like a,
you know, busty blonde

14:40.797 --> 14:42.339
or an Asian with pointy nipples.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.049
But an exact fucking replica...

14:44.133 --> 14:46.260
Stop, Ari. Ari, we get it, okay?

14:46.344 --> 14:48.512
We're sorry and we will work it out.

14:48.596 --> 14:50.556
- There's nothing to work out.
- See what I'm dealing with?

14:50.640 --> 14:53.475
- You see this?
- Shut up, shut up. Lloyd!

14:53.977 --> 14:55.727
- Accounting just brought this up.
- All right.

14:55.812 --> 14:57.813
Look, as repulsed as I am

14:57.981 --> 15:00.899
by the fact that you fucked
your twin brother's wife,

15:00.984 --> 15:02.526
it's not my problem.

15:02.610 --> 15:04.528
Fucking your coworker's wife...

15:04.612 --> 15:05.821
That is.

15:06.823 --> 15:08.615
But now I've got a bigger problem.

15:08.700 --> 15:12.327
- Please tell me that you are Jeff.
- I'm Jim.

15:12.954 --> 15:14.580
How can anyone tell you two apart?

15:14.664 --> 15:17.040
- I wear a Windsor knot.
- What does it matter?!

15:17.125 --> 15:18.333
Jeff...

15:19.168 --> 15:20.877
has outearned you...

15:20.962 --> 15:23.589
significantly
for the past three years.

15:23.798 --> 15:26.091
- So you won't fire him?
- Buddy, listen to me.

15:26.175 --> 15:28.135
I run a business here, not the U.N.

15:28.219 --> 15:30.971
Clearly, you two will never be
able to work together again.

15:31.306 --> 15:33.098
So, what? You're gonna fire me?

15:33.182 --> 15:35.267
You're leaving me no choice.

15:39.105 --> 15:41.023
You know what? Fuck you!

15:41.357 --> 15:42.816
And fuck you!

15:46.029 --> 15:47.613
Hey, you did what you had to do.

15:47.697 --> 15:49.865
- It's about the numbers...
- Get out of my face.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.367
Go back to work. You make me sick.

15:53.036 --> 15:54.202
Lloyd!

15:54.287 --> 15:56.705
The curse of the multiples is over.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.640
Please, Gary, do you
have to throw it at me?

16:14.724 --> 16:17.559
Hey, you want him in close,
working you over with brushes?

16:17.935 --> 16:20.187
We'll get to the details later.

16:24.233 --> 16:26.401
Keep your eyes straight,
please. Don't look at the paint.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.695
The paint will be on you soon.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.037
- Looking good, Johnny.
Whee! Wha!

16:37.121 --> 16:39.373
Whoa! I just talked to the store,

16:39.457 --> 16:41.333
E will have the desk this afternoon.

16:41.417 --> 16:44.461
- Whoa!
- Yeah, great. Well, he better love it

16:44.796 --> 16:46.672
or you're paying for my therapy.

16:46.756 --> 16:48.548
Therapy will let you down.

16:48.883 --> 16:50.092
This...

16:51.177 --> 16:52.761
is your therapy.

16:54.555 --> 16:55.722
What do you mean
you need confirmation?

16:55.807 --> 16:56.848
You are the confirmation.

16:57.058 --> 16:59.601
Well, you need to tell Mr. Chase
that the Screen Actor's Guild

16:59.686 --> 17:01.395
requires him to update his forms.

17:01.479 --> 17:02.479
Update his forms?

17:02.563 --> 17:03.605
He doesn't open his mail!

17:03.690 --> 17:05.190
Sir, please calm down.

17:05.733 --> 17:08.318
You know what? Forget it.
I'll call back.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.820
- Hello?
- Please tell me you're not the idiot

17:10.905 --> 17:12.698
that's been calling "Variety"
trying to take out an ad.

17:12.781 --> 17:14.116
This isn't happening.

17:14.282 --> 17:15.492
Do you really think if someone

17:15.576 --> 17:16.910
calls the press
and throws Vince's name around

17:16.993 --> 17:19.538
- I'm not gonna hear about it?
I'm not trying to keep it a secret.

17:19.622 --> 17:20.789
I'm just trying to get
my name out there a little bit.

17:20.873 --> 17:21.957
By taking out an ad?

17:22.040 --> 17:23.500
Who are you,
the fucking Roto-Rooter man?

17:23.584 --> 17:25.085
You want your name
out there, you call me.

17:25.211 --> 17:26.877
All right, Shauna.
Now that I have you on the phone,

17:26.963 --> 17:28.255
I'd like my name out there a little bit.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.590
- Ask me nicely.
- Shauna...

17:31.342 --> 17:34.594
Go to "Variety," E. Ask for
Jackie Stone. She'll be there till 4:00.

17:34.679 --> 17:35.929
She'll do a press release on you,

17:36.013 --> 17:37.514
ask you a couple of questions,

17:37.598 --> 17:39.766
write a few sentences.
Will take you 20 minutes tops

17:39.851 --> 17:41.268
and it won't cost you a dime.

17:41.352 --> 17:44.521
- Wow. Thanks, Shauna.
- Where's my fucking kid?

17:47.275 --> 17:48.900
He threw up on me.

17:48.985 --> 17:50.485
Oh, relax, Christy.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.655
I'm sure he's not
the first guy to puke on you.

17:55.992 --> 17:57.868
- It's time, Ari! It's time!
- Calm, Lloyd.

17:57.952 --> 17:59.911
Miss Mary J. Blige
just got off the elevator.

17:59.996 --> 18:01.872
- Be cool, Lloyd, be cool.
- I can't be cool.

18:01.956 --> 18:03.665
Oh! Feel my beating heart.

18:04.041 --> 18:06.126
She's a chick, Lloyd.
There may be hope for you yet.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.753
Hey.
- ARl: There she is.

18:07.837 --> 18:09.254
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

18:09.338 --> 18:10.714
- I'm great.
- You look stunning.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.591
Thank you.
You pick out that suit just for me?

18:12.675 --> 18:15.010
Actually, my wife did. You like?

18:16.262 --> 18:17.637
You smell nice.

18:17.722 --> 18:20.432
- Everyone, this is Miss Mary J. Blige!
Hey! Thank you.

18:20.516 --> 18:22.684
I'm excited to be here.

18:22.769 --> 18:25.395
- Thank you.
- ARl: Let's get started.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.522
Let's do it.

18:30.026 --> 18:31.693
Ari, where's Jim?

18:38.242 --> 18:39.951
Hey, fellas. We just got the message.

18:40.036 --> 18:41.077
What's the problem?

18:41.162 --> 18:42.871
This thing will never
get up to that office.

18:42.955 --> 18:46.875
No way. The stairwell is too narrow
and it won't fit in the elevator.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.878
You can't just jack it up
through the window?

18:50.171 --> 18:52.672
Turtle, we couldn't fit
you through that window.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.216
What are you, a smurf?

18:54.300 --> 18:56.468
That's funny, wiseass.

18:56.552 --> 18:57.803
I thought so.

18:57.887 --> 18:59.846
Sorry, Vince. It's a one-piece desk.

18:59.931 --> 19:01.640
The only way you getting
that bad boy up there

19:01.724 --> 19:04.351
is if you cut a hole in the
roof and helicopter it in.

19:04.519 --> 19:06.061
How much would that cost?

19:06.479 --> 19:07.979
It's a joke, smurf.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.398
- Any other suggestions?
- Yeah.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.484
Return the desk
and get your money back.

19:12.819 --> 19:15.737
Man, it's too nice
for this shithole, anyway.

19:16.072 --> 19:17.989
So you haven't
had an office until now?

19:18.282 --> 19:19.491
Well, I really haven't needed one.

19:19.575 --> 19:21.117
I mean, we've had so much
space at Vince's house,

19:21.202 --> 19:23.203
but now we're all living
in a small condo, so...

19:23.412 --> 19:25.330
- You guys live together?
- Yeah.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.374
I mean, but it's not like that.
We've been friends since we were kids.

19:27.458 --> 19:30.210
We're like brothers. Probably don't need
to write that down though.

19:30.294 --> 19:32.128
Oh no, it's an interesting story.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.506
Maybe we could do
something bigger...

19:34.590 --> 19:37.259
A little profile.
Do you have time for a photo?

19:37.635 --> 19:39.010
Yeah, sure.

19:39.220 --> 19:41.179
I didn't even know that you knew Jim.

19:41.264 --> 19:44.015
I know all my people, Ari.
And Jim's really sweet.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.058
Did you know he sends

19:45.142 --> 19:47.018
a personal handwritten note
out with every script?

19:47.103 --> 19:48.436
I did not know that, no.

19:48.521 --> 19:49.729
It's a nice touch.

19:49.814 --> 19:51.439
Hmm. You know what?

19:51.524 --> 19:53.483
We're gonna get Jeff
calligraphy lessons

19:53.568 --> 19:55.360
and now he's gonna be
the one that's sweet to you.

19:55.444 --> 19:57.195
No, please. Keep Jeff away from me.

19:57.280 --> 19:59.072
He's weird
and he's always staring at my ass.

19:59.365 --> 20:01.950
Jeff? No, he has a lazy eye.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.035
That's probably
what you're seeing.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.287
Either way, I like Jim.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.582
- Did you really have to fire him?
- Unfortunately, I did, yeah.

20:09.166 --> 20:11.084
- Why? What happened?
- Uh, you, uh...

20:11.168 --> 20:12.377
The less you know,
the better, believe me.

20:12.461 --> 20:14.629
If I were to tell you all the
details, it would sicken you.

20:15.256 --> 20:16.840
- Sounds bad.
- It is, it is.

20:16.924 --> 20:19.551
Believe me, I take no great pleasure

20:19.635 --> 20:21.803
in firing anyone,
but... especially someone

20:21.888 --> 20:24.222
that's had such
a positive impact on you.

20:24.432 --> 20:26.224
Anyway, Ari, thank you.

20:26.309 --> 20:27.893
- Good stuff in there today.
- Yes, you too...

20:27.977 --> 20:29.769
- Oh, hey, Mary J.
- Hey, Jim, how you doing?

20:29.854 --> 20:32.397
- Let's go back to the office.
- Wait wait wait. No no no no!

20:32.481 --> 20:34.566
- Did he tell you that he fired me?
- Listen, hey,

20:34.650 --> 20:36.359
you don't have to air out
your dirty laundry here.

20:36.444 --> 20:38.570
Oh, would that be
the "my-brother-fucks-my-wife-

20:38.654 --> 20:40.864
he-earns-more-for-you-
you-fire-me"

20:40.948 --> 20:41.990
dirty laundry, asshole?

20:42.074 --> 20:43.617
One love, Mary.

20:45.286 --> 20:46.953
You're an animal, Ari.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.877
- Did you see M.J. Off?
- I saw her off, all right, Lloyd.

20:53.961 --> 20:55.420
Off to I.C.M.

20:55.755 --> 20:59.174
- Jeff!
- Hey, Ari, you got it right.

21:00.593 --> 21:01.593
What the hell?

21:01.677 --> 21:05.055
How can one embryo
produce two fucking losers?

21:05.139 --> 21:07.599
- Ari, what's the problem?
- The problem is...

21:07.683 --> 21:09.309
you're a disgusting mutant.

21:09.393 --> 21:11.519
Now go reconjoin with your brother

21:11.604 --> 21:13.605
on the unemployment line!

21:20.071 --> 21:22.280
I don't know what you're
freaking out about, E.

21:22.365 --> 21:23.823
I went in there
to write a few sentences,

21:24.033 --> 21:25.784
and they ambushed me
with a whole expose

21:25.868 --> 21:28.828
I wasn't ready for it.
Hit "refresh," Turtle.

21:29.330 --> 21:30.372
Nothing.

21:30.456 --> 21:32.082
Well, the new "Variety"
comes up at 10:00 p. m.

21:32.166 --> 21:34.167
Yeah, well,
it's 9:59 and it's not up yet.

21:34.251 --> 21:36.044
- Hit "refresh. "
- Relax, E.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.754
It's just a little press.

21:37.838 --> 21:39.756
It's his first real press, he's nervous.

21:39.840 --> 21:43.426
Yeah, I remember my first piece of
press... "Back Stage West. "

21:43.511 --> 21:46.304
I couldn't
get an audition to save my life

21:46.389 --> 21:49.015
until my groundbreaking
role as Lennie.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.850
Headline on page 14 read

21:50.935 --> 21:54.104
"Of Mice and the Man
Known as Johnny Chase. "

21:54.188 --> 21:57.107
Did they dub you "Candlelight Dinner
Theater's Biggest and Best Retard"?

21:57.191 --> 21:59.901
"Refresh," Turtle.

22:00.194 --> 22:02.070
- Whoa, it's up.
- Huh.

22:02.613 --> 22:03.863
They got a picture, E.

22:03.948 --> 22:05.365
- Good photo.
- You look cute.

22:05.449 --> 22:07.742
What's the headline say?

22:08.035 --> 22:10.620
"The New Nepotism in Hollywood. "

22:10.746 --> 22:12.622
Oh, Jesus Christ. You know, I knew it!

22:12.707 --> 22:15.125
I knew it!
I'm so... I'm so pissed right now.

22:15.209 --> 22:17.210
- Sorry, E.
- What's wrong with nepotism?

22:17.461 --> 22:19.504
Hey, Vince, are you coming?

22:27.054 --> 22:28.179
Who's that?

22:30.933 --> 22:32.350
"A new trend is infiltrating

22:32.435 --> 22:34.728
the already-impenetrable
popular table of Hollywood. "

22:34.812 --> 22:37.188
- You already read this.
- Well, it sounds worse on real paper.

22:37.273 --> 22:38.940
Now the whole city's reading it.

22:39.025 --> 22:41.860
"Eric Murphy has paved the way
for those like Casey Cobb,

22:41.944 --> 22:43.778
childhood friend of Jessica Simpson,

22:43.863 --> 22:45.530
to come and surf
the wave of celebrity

22:45.614 --> 22:47.365
in hopes of becoming
a permanent fixture

22:47.450 --> 22:49.034
in the business of the business. "

22:49.118 --> 22:50.952
You're paving the way, that's a plus.

22:51.037 --> 22:52.996
- Who cares, E, huh?
- Yeah, who cares?

22:53.080 --> 22:54.956
No press is bad press.

22:55.332 --> 22:57.709
- Where are we going?
- To cheer you up.

22:57.793 --> 22:59.044
I just want to
get back in the office,

22:59.128 --> 23:00.503
figure out a way
to repair the damage.

23:00.588 --> 23:01.629
You're gonna need a new desk

23:01.714 --> 23:03.882
to repair the damages.
We got you a new desk.

23:03.966 --> 23:06.426
- You got me a desk?
Uh-huh.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.136
This is it.

23:09.972 --> 23:11.514
- Wow.
You like?

23:11.599 --> 23:14.225
Yeah, I love it.
It's never gonna fit in my office.

23:14.310 --> 23:16.436
Actually, E, it already does.

23:16.854 --> 23:19.355
- Huh?
- This is your office, E.

23:19.940 --> 23:22.067
- And that's mine over there.
- And mine's over there.

23:22.151 --> 23:24.235
And I got one
too, just in case we miss you.

23:24.320 --> 23:27.113
We can all hang.
- Building a sick lounge out there

23:27.198 --> 23:30.158
- with a huge, huge plasma.
- How much was this place, Vince?

23:30.242 --> 23:32.368
E, you can't put a price on comfort.

23:32.453 --> 23:33.953
Just enjoy it.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.623
Thanks, Vince.
Now I feel really worthless.

23:40.086 --> 23:41.669
- Hello.
Hello, Eric Murphy?

23:41.754 --> 23:42.754
Speaking.

23:42.838 --> 23:45.006
Hey, Peter Jackson
calling from New Zealand.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.593
Hi. Thanks for getting back to me.

23:48.677 --> 23:49.761
Would have called you yesterday,

23:49.845 --> 23:51.888
but no one down here
knew who the hell you were.

23:52.389 --> 23:55.058
Eric Murphy... Now you're not
related to Eddie by any chance?

23:55.142 --> 23:57.393
- Well, I'm not.
- Just a little wind-up, mate.

23:57.478 --> 23:59.104
Look, I saw the "Variety" article.

23:59.313 --> 24:01.189
- Yeah?
- Hey, don't worry.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.066
A little media bashing
every now and again

24:03.150 --> 24:04.776
keeps us all honest.

24:04.860 --> 24:07.278
But I'll tell you
something about Ari Gold:

24:07.446 --> 24:09.531
There's only one thing
a cretin like that understands

24:09.615 --> 24:12.200
and that's an airborne
telephone right between the eyes.

24:12.576 --> 24:14.369
Anyway, it's good to know that those of us

24:14.453 --> 24:15.870
that want to be
in the Vincent Chase business

24:15.955 --> 24:18.540
have got a legitimate manager
to talk to.

24:18.791 --> 24:19.791
Well, thank you.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.876
So, look, I'm... I'm
actually kind of busy.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.044
So what exactly do you want?

24:23.129 --> 24:25.088
I wanted to talk to you
about your gaming company.

24:25.673 --> 24:28.091
Well, I'm actually gonna
be in the States next week.

24:28.175 --> 24:29.759
So why don't we do this:

24:29.844 --> 24:32.345
Why don't we have your
assistant call my assistant

24:32.429 --> 24:34.097
and then decide what to do from there?

24:34.181 --> 24:36.057
- How does that sound?
- Great.

24:36.392 --> 24:37.684
- Thank you.
- Cheers.

24:37.768 --> 24:41.312
- What was that?
- I think I'm gonna need an assistant.
