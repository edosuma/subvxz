COOPER:
You told him about the money?

00:08.640 --> 00:11.006
I did what I had to.
You didn't leave me a choice.

00:11.040 --> 00:13.201
You had a choice.
The choice to do exactly
what I told you to do

00:13.240 --> 00:14.468
and leave it alone.

00:14.510 --> 00:16.068
I don't take my orders
from you.

00:16.110 --> 00:18.044
You have no idea
how much worse
you've made this, Hutton.

00:19.780 --> 00:20.769
That some sort of threat?

00:22.050 --> 00:25.486
**

00:25.520 --> 00:27.784

of Al Jahra!

This is Minesweeper One.

Lieutenant Harold Cooper.
We are under fire.

Repeat... This is
Lieutenant Harold Cooper,

01:09.400 --> 01:12.631
Well, what do you think...
great, right?

01:12.670 --> 01:13.830
She has_a lot
of experience.

01:14.740 --> 01:17.163
Yeah, all her references
raved about her.

01:17.210 --> 01:18.666
We're meeting
this afternoon,

01:18.710 --> 01:20.871
but I have a good
feeling about her.

01:20.910 --> 01:23.174
Looks like you found
yourself a nanny.

01:23.210 --> 01:24.643
Which is a huge relief.

01:24.680 --> 01:27.410
I mean, it's impossible
to find someone great.

01:27.450 --> 01:28.769
Mm. I wouldn't know.

01:30.520 --> 01:33.216
Have you reached out to her
yet... To your daughter?

01:33.260 --> 01:35.148
I haven't worked up
the courage up yet.

01:35.190 --> 01:36.919
You should just do it.

01:36.960 --> 01:38.723
I put her through
some dark times.

01:40.730 --> 01:43.494
Have you noticed the men
parked across the street

01:43.530 --> 01:45.566
every day? Every night?

01:45.600 --> 01:47.864
Ithoughtso,
but I wasn't sure.

01:47.900 --> 01:50.664
They're there
for my protection.

01:50.710 --> 01:52.530
Yours? Why?

01:52.580 --> 01:54.036
Who do you need
protection from?

01:54.080 --> 01:55.274
My mother.

01:55.310 --> 01:57.005
No, that...
That can't be true.

01:57.050 --> 02:00.019
Just trust me. Whatever pushed
you and your daughter apart,

02:00.050 --> 02:03.508
it's nothing compared
to what me and my mother
have gone through.

02:03.550 --> 02:04.915
Just call her.

02:04.950 --> 02:07.009
I'm sure
she'd appreciate it.

02:07.060 --> 02:09.255
Would you appreciate it
if your mother called you?

02:09.290 --> 02:10.882
It doesn't matter.
She's not gonng to.

02:10.930 --> 02:12.727
But if she did.
She won't.

02:12.760 --> 02:14.398
My mother isn't like you.

02:14.430 --> 02:16.489
You want a relationship
with your daughter.

02:18.130 --> 02:19.961
She doesn't.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.764
**

02:27.640 --> 02:30.177
Hey.
What's going on?

02:32.320 --> 02:34.311
We've done great work.

02:34.350 --> 02:36.716
Important work.

02:36.750 --> 02:38.217
Work we can be proud of.

02:38.250 --> 02:40.787
I...think so, too.

02:40.820 --> 02:43.983
I've made up my mind about
Reddington's true identity.

02:44.030 --> 02:45.884
I'm going to tell
Main Justice.

02:45.930 --> 02:47.727
And risk having them
shut us down?

02:47.760 --> 02:49.819
As I say,

02:49.870 --> 02:51.167
we've done great work.

02:51.200 --> 02:53.498
But does it really matter
who he is?

02:53.540 --> 02:55.735
To the job we're doing,
I mean.

02:55.770 --> 02:57.704
Not to me.
It will to them.

02:58.710 --> 03:00.177
Was there something
you wanted?

03:00.210 --> 03:03.008
Yeah. I, uh, wanted
this afternoon off.

03:03.050 --> 03:05.143
I found a nanny.
Well, I-I think I did.

03:05.180 --> 03:06.579
I'm meeting with her
this afternoon.

03:06.620 --> 03:09.612
I told you before...
take whatever time you need.

03:09.650 --> 03:11.242
About Reddington.

03:11.290 --> 03:13.087
Have you already reached out
to Main Justice?

03:13.120 --> 03:16.521
Yes. I've set a meeting
with Cynthia Panabaker.

03:16.560 --> 03:17.788
Sir.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

03:17.830 --> 03:21.152
Uh, this just came in
over SIPRNet.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.259
Odd, right?
What's odd about it?

03:23.300 --> 03:26.531
It was sent from an unofficial
CIA outpost...in Zahedan.

03:27.340 --> 03:29.365
**

03:29.410 --> 03:31.833
You're sure this is correct?
I decoded it myself.

03:31.870 --> 03:34.373
_I need_ verification.
Fingerprints, dog tags,

03:34.410 --> 03:36.105
a photo... whatever they can
send us right away.

03:36.140 --> 03:38.506
Yes, sir. But...
Who is Daniel Hutton?

03:40.920 --> 03:43.184
A man who died
30 years ago.

04:06.240 --> 04:07.935
I received
some news today.

04:08.580 --> 04:10.172
Daniel Hutton is alive.

04:11.080 --> 04:13.071
Well, that's not possible.

04:13.120 --> 04:16.715
COOPER:
He walked out of the mountains
of Southern Iran yesterday.

04:16.750 --> 04:19.514
Found his way
to a classified CIA outpost.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.687
Daniel Hutton
is dead, Harold.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.722
We both know that.
Do we?

04:23.760 --> 04:26.729
Because it seems he's risen
like Lazarus from the grave.

04:26.760 --> 04:28.728
Hutton is reporting
he's been kept prisoner

04:28.760 --> 04:31.923
at multiple locations
in the Middle East since 1989.

04:31.970 --> 04:34.939
He escaped from captivity
a week ago,
asked for me by name.

04:34.970 --> 04:37.768
CIA assets in Iran
reached out to us directly.

04:37.810 --> 04:39.437
They don't want anything
to do with this.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.675
He's asking for my help
to get him out of the country,

04:41.710 --> 04:45.339
or his captors will
hunt him down and kill him.

04:45.380 --> 04:47.177
Did you know?
All this time?

04:47.220 --> 04:48.369
Did I know what?

04:48.420 --> 04:49.978
That he's alive?

04:51.550 --> 04:54.212
While you held this
over my head.

04:54.260 --> 04:59.220
I gave you that so you
could put the whole incident
behind you,

04:59.260 --> 05:03.390
not carry it like an albatross
around your neck.

05:03.430 --> 05:06.934
I believed, as you believed,
that the man was dead

05:06.970 --> 05:09.859
and that the issue
of what happened
there in Kuwait

05:09.910 --> 05:11.969
was resolved.

05:12.010 --> 05:13.705
I won't look
the other way again.

05:13.740 --> 05:16.129
I've carried this secret
for way too long.

05:16.180 --> 05:17.909
I have to do something.

05:17.950 --> 05:20.418
I suggest
the utmost discretion.

05:20.450 --> 05:23.647
To preserve flexibility.

05:23.690 --> 05:24.941
What do you mean,
flexibility?

05:24.990 --> 05:26.457
It's Iran, Harold.

05:26.490 --> 05:28.708
We can't just stroll
through the front door.

05:28.760 --> 05:31.388
We don't know
what we're walking into.

05:31.430 --> 05:32.658
So we keep it small.

05:32.700 --> 05:34.395
No team.

05:34.430 --> 05:36.057
Just you and I.

05:36.100 --> 05:38.989
Until you look this man
in the eyes.

05:39.030 --> 05:41.464
Until you know for sure

05:41.500 --> 05:43.104
what you plan to do.

05:44.270 --> 05:45.601
I plan to do
the right thing.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.329
We'll soon find out,
won't we?

05:54.620 --> 05:57.646
**

05:57.690 --> 05:59.248
COOPER:
It happened fast.

05:59.290 --> 06:01.258
I remember Lieutenant Hutton
getting hit.

06:01.290 --> 06:02.951
I remember radioing
and returning fire,

06:02.990 --> 06:04.821
but they were everywhere.

06:04.860 --> 06:07.328
I tried to keep him safe,
but next thing I knew...

06:09.300 --> 06:11.621
They had taken him.

06:11.670 --> 06:13.638
He was gone.

06:13.670 --> 06:16.298
INTERVIEWER: Your actions
were commendable,
Lieutenant Cooper.

06:16.340 --> 06:18.205
But I have to ask you
about reports

06:18.240 --> 06:20.435
that you and Lieutenant Hutton
were seen having an argument

06:20.480 --> 06:21.799
prior to these events.

06:23.350 --> 06:25.375
That never happened.
What never happened?

06:25.410 --> 06:27.878
That you had words, or
that they were argumentative?

06:27.920 --> 06:30.047
**

06:34.520 --> 06:37.080
**

06:41.100 --> 06:42.522
What are you doing?
What is this, Harold?

06:42.570 --> 06:43.867
These are supposed
to be med supplies.

06:43.900 --> 06:45.527
Close the crate.
Where's this going?

06:45.570 --> 06:47.162
Who are you funding?
Is it the Kurds?

06:47.200 --> 06:48.895
You're smuggling cash
over the border to Iraq

06:48.940 --> 06:50.567
to fund rebels...
I said close the crate.

06:50.610 --> 06:51.963
We're here to help stabilize
this region,

06:52.010 --> 06:53.409
not bankroll some private,
dirty little war.

06:53.440 --> 06:55.908
Dan, I'm warning you...
just close the crate.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.879
**

07:00.920 --> 07:03.480
(CLICK)

07:03.520 --> 07:07.058
I forgot how handsome
you were back then, Harold.

07:07.090 --> 07:10.082
And how loosely tethered
to the facts.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.257
You're one to talk
about facts.

07:12.290 --> 07:14.190
Aren't you, Mr. Koslov?

07:14.230 --> 07:17.825
Ah! So Elizabeth
finally told you.

07:17.870 --> 07:19.861
She took longer
than I thought she would.

07:19.900 --> 07:23.904
Once word was out, I figured
I was on borrowed time.

07:23.940 --> 07:26.579
And I'm sure,
knowing you as I do,

07:26.610 --> 07:28.737
that you'll feel
an obligation

07:28.780 --> 07:30.998
to report this
to the powers that be.

07:31.050 --> 07:33.371
I don't see a way around it.
If you do that, Harold,

07:33.420 --> 07:36.116
they'll take the task force
away from you.

07:36.150 --> 07:38.345
It'll be the end
of what you've built.

07:38.390 --> 07:40.051
I'm sorry.
It's my duty.

07:41.260 --> 07:43.558
Mm.

07:43.590 --> 07:46.388
Well, we're not finished
just yet, are we?

07:46.430 --> 07:48.193
You must admit, though,
it's ironic.

07:48.230 --> 07:50.619
Us jetting over there
to protect your secret,

07:50.670 --> 07:53.366
and you refusing
to protect mine.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.231
We're not
"protecting" anything.

07:55.270 --> 07:56.908
We're righting
what was wrong.

07:58.170 --> 07:59.899
Keep telling yourself that.

08:01.510 --> 08:04.047
How do you even know
about Hutton?

08:04.080 --> 08:05.308
The real Reddington
was there.

08:05.350 --> 08:06.647
He was part
of an oversight panel

08:06.680 --> 08:08.545
and testified
about it later.

08:08.580 --> 08:09.808
But you're not him.

08:09.850 --> 08:11.283
How do you know
anything about it

08:11.320 --> 08:12.958
if you weren't there?

08:12.990 --> 08:14.514
I know because...

08:17.590 --> 08:18.579
I know.

08:19.260 --> 08:21.125
Because whoever I once was,

08:21.160 --> 08:25.119
I am now
and will continue to be
Raymond Reddington.

08:26.370 --> 08:30.761
Given where we're going,
the real question
is, who are you?

08:30.810 --> 08:32.459
Are you the man
in front of me

08:32.510 --> 08:35.308
who I know
to be good and decent?

08:35.340 --> 08:37.240
Or are you
the man from years ago

08:37.280 --> 08:41.011
who got himself into this mess
in the first place?

at the airstrip.

08:47.390 --> 08:49.449
Do you think Hutton knows?

08:49.490 --> 08:51.128
Do you think
he has any idea

08:51.160 --> 08:53.128
what part you played
in what happened back then?

08:53.160 --> 08:54.525
I don't think so.

08:54.560 --> 08:57.120
Otherwise, he wouldn't
have asked for me.

08:57.170 --> 09:00.492
Let's hope not.
Because if he does
hold you responsible

09:00.540 --> 09:03.737
and if he plans
to tell the world,

09:03.770 --> 09:05.635
then we'll have
to shut him up.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.774
I'm not gonna do that.
No, I know.
