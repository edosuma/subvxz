00:12.145 --> 00:14.579
<i>My name is Alissa Vincent.</i>

00:14.647 --> 00:17.115
<i>I may be the sole survivor.</i>

00:17.183 --> 00:19.048
<i>We encountered an alien life form.</i>

00:19.119 --> 00:21.246
<i>They have taken over</i>
<i>the bodies of the crew.</i>

00:22.722 --> 00:25.213
<i>The colony was lost.</i>

00:25.291 --> 00:27.919
<i>My team is dead.</i>

00:27.994 --> 00:32.522
<i>It is my belief that the artifact</i>
<i>we discovered on the surface</i>

00:32.598 --> 00:35.067
<i>is somehow responsible.</i>

00:35.135 --> 00:37.126
<i>If you find this recording,</i>

00:37.203 --> 00:40.138
<i>the</i> Ishimura <i>and the artifact</i>

00:40.206 --> 00:42.037
<i>must be destroyed.</i>

00:42.108 --> 00:43.973
<i>- must be destroyed.</i>

00:44.044 --> 00:46.410
<i>- must be destroyed.</i>

01:29.622 --> 01:30.680
30 meters.

01:30.757 --> 01:34.090
Whatever it is, it's just up ahead.

01:34.160 --> 01:36.754
Any idea what it is?

01:36.830 --> 01:37.990
Not a clue.

01:38.064 --> 01:40.931
This planet is ripe
with unusual seismic activity.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.900
Protocol says we're required
to check it out,

01:42.969 --> 01:44.163
so we're checking it out.

01:44.237 --> 01:47.229
All right, heads up.
We've got a small impact crater ahead.

01:47.307 --> 01:48.899
Watch your footing.

02:16.002 --> 02:17.697
Toggle your flares.

02:17.770 --> 02:20.204
Let's take a look
at what we're dealing with.

02:22.375 --> 02:25.037
There's something strange
about these walls.

02:25.111 --> 02:27.045
There's evidence of chemical weathering.

02:32.452 --> 02:36.252
And there's symmetrical
45 degree scarring on these walls.

02:37.257 --> 02:41.421
Anybody else think these marks
resemble the ones made by an E-34?

02:42.562 --> 02:45.497
Well, I would if we weren't
several million light years from home

02:45.565 --> 02:47.260
on a previously unexplored rock.

02:47.333 --> 02:50.791
Yet, we have E-34 drag lines as well.

02:50.870 --> 02:54.636
Nobody's used an E-34
elephant drilling rig in over 150 years.

02:54.707 --> 02:57.403
Hell, I've only seen them in books.

02:58.645 --> 03:00.135
I'm going to radio the colony.

03:00.213 --> 03:03.182
Somebody's been messing around out here.

03:03.249 --> 03:06.912
Jen, you're going
to want to look at this.

03:27.273 --> 03:29.241
Oh, my God.

03:30.643 --> 03:32.508
We've got to call this in.

03:37.016 --> 03:38.347
<i>This is Aegis Colony.</i>

03:38.418 --> 03:39.646
<i>Artifact discovered.</i>

03:39.719 --> 03:42.187
<i>Could be a second Marker.</i>
<i>Please advise.</i>

03:42.255 --> 03:44.348
<i>Unitologist Church has been notified.</i>

03:44.424 --> 03:46.051
<i>They're awaiting specs.</i>

03:46.125 --> 03:49.390
<i>Earth, you should have an image.</i>
<i>Files are uploaded.</i>

03:49.462 --> 03:52.260
<i>My God, we've found it.</i>

03:54.267 --> 03:55.825
<i>Launch of</i> Ishimura <i>on schedule.</i>

03:55.902 --> 03:57.460
<i>Arrival on station: one month.</i>

03:57.537 --> 04:00.028
<i>Prepare the artifact</i>
<i>for transfer to the ship.</i>

04:01.908 --> 04:06.208
<i>Artifact removed from discovery site.</i>
<i>Strange interference generated.</i>

04:06.279 --> 04:09.009
<i>Unexplained violence</i>
<i>reported among colonists.</i>

04:09.082 --> 04:11.107
<i>Planet security handling it.</i>

04:11.184 --> 04:14.415
<i>Artifact is quarantined</i>
<i>and ready for removal.</i>

04:14.487 --> 04:15.511
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

04:15.588 --> 04:18.921
Ishimura <i>will be on station</i>
<i>and ready for transport shortly.</i>

04:18.992 --> 04:22.723
<i>Our expert, Dr. Kyne, is aboard</i>
<i>and will coordinate the experiments.</i>

04:22.795 --> 04:24.990
<i>Altman be praised.</i>

05:07.707 --> 05:09.038
That's odd.

05:09.108 --> 05:11.474
What the hell's been
going wrong down there?

05:11.544 --> 05:13.808
<i>Chief Vincent,</i>
<i>you're wanted on the bridge.</i>

05:13.880 --> 05:15.040
What's up?

05:15.114 --> 05:16.706
<i>The captain is ready to see you.</i>

05:16.783 --> 05:17.841
On my way.

05:17.917 --> 05:19.942
Audio off.

05:20.019 --> 05:21.577
About fucking time.

05:43.543 --> 05:44.703
Lights out.

05:56.923 --> 06:01.917
So I tell her, artifact or not,
in the grand scheme of things,

06:01.994 --> 06:04.155
we are all alone out here.

06:04.230 --> 06:09.293
Might be a long time ago the universe
had all kinds of life, but now...

06:09.369 --> 06:10.529
You know what I think?

06:10.603 --> 06:12.332
I think the thing is cursed.

06:12.405 --> 06:14.305
I mean look what's happened
since they found it.

06:14.374 --> 06:17.104
I don't remember you getting paid
to think, Jackson.

06:17.176 --> 06:18.973
Now go help secure those gravity tethers.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.808
We've got a whole operation
waiting on this thing.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.711
Someone or something

06:22.782 --> 06:25.182
put that thing here for a reason,
that's all I know.

06:26.185 --> 06:28.915
It's a good thing no one asked you.

06:28.988 --> 06:30.512
Come on, Collin.

06:30.590 --> 06:34.856
You telling me that the thing
ain't creeping the shit out of you?

06:34.927 --> 06:38.363
I mean, the suicides, the murders?

06:38.431 --> 06:40.422
Seems like everyone on this rock
is losing their shit.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.697
This is deep space.
Weird shit happens.

06:43.770 --> 06:46.136
The faster we do our jobs,
the faster we get home.

06:47.206 --> 06:49.299
Your wife discovered it
and she still has no theory

06:49.375 --> 06:50.967
about where it came from?

06:52.245 --> 06:56.181
The Unitologists seem to have an idea
that this is what created us,

06:56.249 --> 06:57.910
or something stupid like that.

06:57.984 --> 07:00.953
Jen is a geologist and a site surveyor,

07:01.020 --> 07:05.650
not an anthropologist,
archeologist, or Unitologist.

07:05.725 --> 07:08.023
Besides, she hasn't been well.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.722
That's more the reason to get this thing
aboard ship and go home.

07:10.797 --> 07:13.197
<i> What the hell
is going on down there, Barrow?</i>

07:13.266 --> 07:15.496
<i>We've got a timeline</i>
<i>and a planet to crack.</i>

07:15.568 --> 07:17.593
Everything is fine, <i>Ishimura.</i>

07:17.670 --> 07:21.231
Securing the last anchor now.
We'll be moving out momentarily.

07:36.556 --> 07:40.185
What secrets do you have for us?

07:40.259 --> 07:41.954
<i>Dr. Kyne...</i>

07:42.028 --> 07:43.893
<i>you're needed in the med lab.</i>

07:43.963 --> 07:45.453
On the way.

08:02.915 --> 08:04.576
Steady now.

08:15.628 --> 08:17.459
- Captain.
- You wanted to see me?

08:17.530 --> 08:21.091
As chief of security on this ship,
I would like to severely protest

08:21.167 --> 08:22.657
bringing the artifact aboard.

08:22.735 --> 08:24.726
You've already made your protests heard,

08:24.804 --> 08:26.669
and I have already taken them
into account, thank you.

08:26.739 --> 08:28.331
Captain.

08:28.407 --> 08:31.433
You've given me
the incident counts for the colony,

08:31.511 --> 08:35.311
and I say that this colony has been
in operation for two and a half years.

08:35.381 --> 08:38.441
That much time in deep space
is inherently dangerous.

08:38.518 --> 08:42.249
And the people attracted
to this line of work are, too.

08:42.321 --> 08:44.755
You're forgetting one thing, Captain.

08:44.824 --> 08:46.985
A spike in serious violent incidents

08:47.059 --> 08:48.856
have been reported over the last week.

08:48.928 --> 08:52.364
We pulled that thing up a week ago.

08:52.431 --> 08:55.457
I have my orders and you have yours.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.866
Just tell me this.

08:56.936 --> 08:59.336
Why is this thing so important?

08:59.405 --> 09:02.203
Alissa, don't fight me on this.

09:02.275 --> 09:06.609
Once Kyne has studied the Marker,
you can have your team run a full analysis.

09:08.047 --> 09:09.810
Yes, sir.

09:38.511 --> 09:41.139
Gravity tethers full tension
and stable, Captain.

09:41.213 --> 09:42.646
All systems are go, sir.

09:42.715 --> 09:44.342
All right, Mr. White.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.782
Pop the cork.

10:59.759 --> 11:01.624
I had to kill.
You understand?

11:01.694 --> 11:04.686
They need bodies.
They need us to turn.

11:04.764 --> 11:06.698
All right, Mr. Leggio.

11:06.766 --> 11:08.825
Sometimes the sedatives
cause hallucinations.

11:08.901 --> 11:10.596
Just relax, okay?

11:10.670 --> 11:13.605
Why is this man still awake?
I told you to give him a sedative.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.972
I did. 500 cc's, just like you ordered.

11:17.043 --> 11:18.237
He's fighting it.

11:18.310 --> 11:19.299
You don't hear that?

11:19.378 --> 11:22.108
My God, make it stop!

11:28.854 --> 11:30.219
Kill me!

11:38.798 --> 11:40.390
Nurse, help me restrain him!

11:40.466 --> 11:44.095
Kill me! Just fucking kill me!

11:44.170 --> 11:46.798
Hold him still, Nurse.

11:54.780 --> 11:56.748
That should do it.

11:59.919 --> 12:01.614
What the hell just happened?

12:01.687 --> 12:04.747
I've never seen someone resist
a sedative of that quantity.

12:04.824 --> 12:06.382
It's not possible.

12:06.459 --> 12:08.893
I have no idea.

12:08.961 --> 12:11.759
Two weeks ago, this man
was healthy and mentally stable.

12:11.831 --> 12:14.629
Then out of nowhere,
he kills two members of his dig team.

12:14.700 --> 12:16.964
None of this makes much sense.

12:17.036 --> 12:19.971
Some kind of toxin, maybe.

12:20.039 --> 12:21.438
Something in the colony?

12:21.507 --> 12:22.701
Maybe.

12:22.775 --> 12:26.472
This rash of unusual cases
coming from the planet puzzles me.

12:26.545 --> 12:28.513
I need full blood work done ASAP.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.310
Test for anything and everything.

12:30.382 --> 12:31.371
Yes, Doctor.

12:59.979 --> 13:02.345
Good work, people.
She's coming up nicely.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.593
Normal electromagnetic surges.

13:14.660 --> 13:17.288
The magnetic field of the planet
is bleeding out.

13:17.363 --> 13:19.354
Nothing to worry about.

13:44.757 --> 13:45.849
What's happening?

13:45.925 --> 13:48.894
I'm not sure.
The entire system is rebooting.

13:48.961 --> 13:50.861
Our power cores are shielded.

13:50.930 --> 13:52.090
Yes, I know.

13:52.164 --> 13:55.395
Another wave of disruption just broke
from the surface and smacked into us.

13:55.467 --> 13:58.197
It's a temporary glitch,
not an attack, Alissa.

13:58.270 --> 14:00.329
Down, girl.

14:00.406 --> 14:03.375
- Asshole.
- Break it up, you two.

14:03.442 --> 14:05.103
Chic, can you raise the colony?

14:05.177 --> 14:06.644
Well, things are choppy at best.

14:06.712 --> 14:08.703
We've lost 40% of the comlink signal.

14:08.781 --> 14:10.112
Can you isolate the problem?

14:10.182 --> 14:12.241
I've never seen interference like this.

14:12.318 --> 14:17.153
I have, when I was a pilot back Earth-side
and my radar was being jammed.

14:17.223 --> 14:20.215
You think this is intentionally
directed at us?

14:20.292 --> 14:23.193
That's a dead planet
and we're the only people out here.

14:23.262 --> 14:26.493
How in the hell is something
intentionally jamming us?

14:26.565 --> 14:28.032
I'm just saying what it looks like.

14:28.100 --> 14:31.433
It could just be excess magnetic feedback
from the planet crack.

14:31.503 --> 14:33.300
Chick, get me Foreman Barrow.

14:33.372 --> 14:35.567
I want to know what's happening down there.

14:35.641 --> 14:37.040
<i>Captain, I don't know</i>
<i>if you can hear me,</i>

14:37.109 --> 14:39.373
<i>but we must have pulled</i>
<i>too closely to the core.</i>

14:39.445 --> 14:41.379
<i>Things are shaking</i>
<i>like a mother down here.</i>

14:41.447 --> 14:42.436
<i>We've got heavy interference.</i>

14:42.514 --> 14:44.379
Over.

14:44.450 --> 14:47.146
You reading me, <i>Ishimura?</i>
Nothing.

14:47.219 --> 14:49.915
<i>Barrow, come in.</i>

14:49.989 --> 14:51.718
<i>Barrow.</i>

14:51.790 --> 14:54.452
<i>Barrow, this is the captain.</i>
<i>Report in.</i>

14:54.526 --> 14:56.460
<i>Barrow.</i>

15:04.303 --> 15:06.828
- The planet is pushing back.
- What?

15:06.906 --> 15:09.568
Something I read about the danger
of harvesting planets.

15:09.642 --> 15:12.076
You got another line of work
you're looking to get into?

15:12.144 --> 15:15.375
It says that the planet cracking procedure
is extremely dangerous

15:15.447 --> 15:16.812
to the overall harmony of the universe.

15:16.882 --> 15:20.249
What a bunch of Unitologist bullshit.

15:20.319 --> 15:22.753
The only planets we ever found
in all of space are dead.

15:22.821 --> 15:24.220
Earth was a fluke.

15:46.245 --> 15:48.145
It's a ghost town in here.

15:48.213 --> 15:50.408
Where the hell is everybody?

16:07.232 --> 16:09.723
I'm going to check on Jen.
Catch you later.

16:53.879 --> 16:55.938
Jen?

16:56.015 --> 16:57.812
Where are you?

17:18.069 --> 17:20.163
What the fuck?

17:23.375 --> 17:25.502
These symbols are the same as...

17:42.628 --> 17:46.155
Honey, what are you doing?

17:46.231 --> 17:48.096
They want our bodies.

17:48.167 --> 17:51.068
This is mine...

17:51.136 --> 17:55.732
my flesh, my bone, and my blood.

17:58.110 --> 17:59.372
No!

18:11.990 --> 18:14.481
No, no, no!

18:14.560 --> 18:15.584
Jen?

18:15.661 --> 18:19.119
Oh, baby.
Fuck. Why?

18:19.198 --> 18:21.189
Jen.

18:31.977 --> 18:35.743
My last analysis of the Marker
suggests a psychosomatic energy field

18:35.814 --> 18:37.611
unlike anything I've ever seen.

18:37.683 --> 18:39.776
This interference is rising from the planet.

18:39.852 --> 18:41.479
The Marker's not the problem here.

18:41.553 --> 18:43.180
I know, it... it's just...

18:43.255 --> 18:44.950
Just what, Doctor?

18:45.023 --> 18:48.254
Something's not right.

18:48.327 --> 18:49.851
Communications just came back up.

18:49.928 --> 18:52.624
I'm reacquiring the colony's signal.

18:52.698 --> 18:56.725
We're pulling scattershot low-res images
from the personal cams.

18:58.704 --> 19:00.797
What the...

19:00.873 --> 19:02.807
Put it on the main monitors.

19:16.088 --> 19:19.114
We need to send a security team
down there now, Captain.

19:19.191 --> 19:21.682
Captain, I'm getting
multiple flat lines across the board.

19:27.266 --> 19:29.666
Good God,
they're being slaughtered.

19:29.735 --> 19:32.795
- By what?
- I'm going down there now.

19:32.871 --> 19:34.736
Not until I know what the hell is happening.

19:34.806 --> 19:37.570
Chic, get someone on the com.
I want a sit-rep ASAP.

20:11.977 --> 20:13.501
Hold on, baby.

20:13.579 --> 20:15.444
We're going home.

20:38.303 --> 20:39.793
I've raised one of the dig crews.

20:41.406 --> 20:42.930
Ishimura, <i>can you hear us?</i>

20:43.008 --> 20:46.409
<i>Something's down here,</i>
<i>killing everyone.</i>

20:46.478 --> 20:48.173
<i>My dig crew has changed.</i>

20:48.247 --> 20:51.375
<i>I think there's something down...</i>
<i>Help us, God damn it!</i>

20:51.450 --> 20:53.645
This is <i>Ishimura.</i>
We are reading you.

20:53.719 --> 20:55.084
Who is killing everyone?

20:55.153 --> 20:57.781
<i>- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!</i>

21:00.092 --> 21:03.027
Dig team, come in.
This is <i>Ishimura,</i> come in. Over.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.222
Start scanning frequencies.

21:06.732 --> 21:08.393
Don't fuck with me right now.

21:08.467 --> 21:10.594
Get on the horn and get me the colony.

21:12.537 --> 21:15.301
Captain, we need to call for help.

21:15.374 --> 21:17.638
We don't have the forces
to protect the ship.

21:17.709 --> 21:20.371
I don't need to remind you
that this is a restricted system,

21:20.445 --> 21:22.413
and we're not supposed to be here.

21:22.481 --> 21:23.505
You don't.

21:23.582 --> 21:25.482
But the circumstances have changed.

21:25.550 --> 21:26.744
My orders haven't.

21:26.818 --> 21:28.581
Then at least let's contact the church.

21:28.654 --> 21:30.645
- They must know about...
- About what?

21:36.862 --> 21:40.662
The effects of the Marker are like nothing
documented in the religious texts.

21:40.732 --> 21:42.563
And your crew is being wiped out
as we speak.

21:42.634 --> 21:46.468
I have a feeling that we have at least
something very dangerous down there,

21:46.538 --> 21:48.096
and we need guidance.

21:48.173 --> 21:50.698
- Do you think they know?
- Who?

21:50.776 --> 21:52.073
The crew.

21:52.144 --> 21:55.204
Most of the key officers
are sympathetic to the church.

21:55.280 --> 21:57.544
Maybe a third of the crew
are with the church. Why?

21:57.616 --> 22:02.815
We're going to abandon the colony
and return the Marker to Earth.

22:02.888 --> 22:04.651
It's the only thing to do.

22:04.723 --> 22:06.987
I cannot afford a mutiny on my ship.

22:07.059 --> 22:09.027
Sir, I need to take a team down there.

22:09.094 --> 22:11.358
At the very least we need to know
what we're dealing with.

22:11.430 --> 22:14.194
Denied. No one is allowed
on or off the colony.

22:14.266 --> 22:16.427
You're condemning innocent people.

22:16.501 --> 22:19.197
You want me to put the entire ship at risk?

22:19.271 --> 22:21.000
Is that your brilliant idea?

22:21.073 --> 22:23.507
Captain Matthius,
we've got an incoming shuttle.

22:23.575 --> 22:25.042
Just picked her up on radar.
She's close.

22:25.110 --> 22:26.543
Lock the bay doors on every level.

22:26.611 --> 22:27.737
They're survivors.

22:27.813 --> 22:29.872
Maybe they can tell us
what's happening down there.

22:29.948 --> 22:33.185
Do what I say, and do it now.

22:38.223 --> 22:40.316
<i>Shuttle Seven, this is the</i> Ishimura.

22:40.392 --> 22:43.054
<i>You are ordered to return</i>
<i>to the surface immediately.</i>

22:43.128 --> 22:44.117
<i>Do you read me?</i>

22:44.196 --> 22:46.687
<i>You cannot land on board the</i> Ishimura.

22:46.765 --> 22:49.131
<i>- Over.</i>
- Fuck you, <i>Ishimura.</i>

22:49.201 --> 22:51.635
Landing, crashing, or shot down.
Pick one.

22:51.703 --> 22:53.762
But there's no way in hell we're going back.

23:26.204 --> 23:28.764
Captain, the shuttle just
slipped through Bay 17

23:28.840 --> 23:30.535
before we could secure the doors.

23:30.609 --> 23:31.837
Get down there now.

23:31.910 --> 23:34.105
Arrest everyone on board that shuttle
and quarantine them.

23:34.179 --> 23:37.273
You sure you don't want me
to shoot them first?

24:06.344 --> 24:08.039
Eyes up, people.

24:09.681 --> 24:11.945
What exactly are we
dealing with here, Vincent?

24:12.017 --> 24:15.180
Asked as if I had a fucking clue.

24:23.995 --> 24:26.156
Clear right.

24:26.231 --> 24:27.755
Clear left.

24:29.334 --> 24:33.134
Jesus, what the hell happened here?

24:34.840 --> 24:38.936
There's a hell of a lot of blood,
but no bodies.

24:39.010 --> 24:40.534
Sounds like one of your parties.

24:40.612 --> 24:41.601
Or your sex life.

24:41.680 --> 24:42.908
Cut the chatter, people.

24:42.981 --> 24:44.573
This thing didn't crash itself.

24:44.649 --> 24:48.585
If someone was piloting this bird,
they ain't here.

24:48.653 --> 24:49.847
Blood trails.

24:52.357 --> 24:54.188
Someone got off this shuttle.

24:54.259 --> 24:55.692
Where the hell are they?

24:59.264 --> 25:00.788
We're moving out.

26:03.762 --> 26:06.993
No. No.

27:13.031 --> 27:14.623
You don't look well.

27:14.699 --> 27:16.098
Vincent's team has secured the dock.

27:16.167 --> 27:18.101
There's no sign of the shuttle crew.

27:18.169 --> 27:19.796
They're beginning a search of the ship.

27:19.871 --> 27:21.429
- And...
- And what?

27:21.506 --> 27:23.872
We've lost all contact with the colony.

27:25.710 --> 27:28.440
I want you to check on the artifact.
Make sure it's secure.

27:28.513 --> 27:30.777
We are in over our heads.

27:30.849 --> 27:35.411
You need to contact Earth and find out
what our next course of action should be.

27:35.487 --> 27:38.479
I think this is a test of our faith.

27:38.556 --> 27:39.545
What?

27:42.327 --> 27:43.794
Nothing.

27:43.862 --> 27:46.023
Just get down there, Doctor.

27:54.039 --> 27:55.404
Get back to your stations.

27:55.473 --> 27:57.168
We have a right to see it.

27:57.242 --> 27:58.539
You can't lock it away.

27:58.610 --> 28:00.976
It's a holy relic.
We have the right.

28:01.046 --> 28:03.514
Clear this area immediately.

28:04.983 --> 28:06.678
This is a secure area,

28:06.751 --> 28:09.618
and Captain Matthius
wants the artifact left alone.

28:12.223 --> 28:13.281
Excuse me.

28:13.358 --> 28:15.826
I'd like to talk to them.
l... I think I can help.

28:15.894 --> 28:17.259
Who are you?

28:17.328 --> 28:20.297
Samuel Irons, Engineering Specialist.

28:20.365 --> 28:22.799
Are you a rock worshiper, too, Irons?

28:22.867 --> 28:26.234
It may be useful to have
one of their own speaking to them.

28:26.304 --> 28:29.364
Your presence might be
misinterpreted as hostile.

28:29.441 --> 28:30.965
This is me being cordial.

28:32.010 --> 28:34.035
You want to see hostile?

28:34.112 --> 28:36.080
Let the man speak with them.

28:36.147 --> 28:39.310
All right, play the piper
and lead the flock out of here

28:39.384 --> 28:42.319
before someone gets
their nuts stomped on.

28:42.387 --> 28:43.376
Thank you.

28:45.290 --> 28:48.817
Brothers and sisters,
there will be plenty of time

28:48.893 --> 28:52.454
to observe the holy relic
when we return to Earth.

28:52.530 --> 28:54.657
The church must first interpret the markings

28:54.733 --> 28:57.634
if we are to be enlightened by their words.

28:57.702 --> 29:03.004
Interfering with the captain's orders
will not help resolve our current crisis.

29:03.074 --> 29:06.339
Right now we must pray
for our fellow pilgrims

29:06.411 --> 29:10.142
on the surface of the planet
whose lives may be in danger.

29:10.215 --> 29:15.653
Set the example that we Unitologists
are not hysterical fanatics.

29:15.720 --> 29:19.247
We respect the orders of our captain.

29:26.231 --> 29:27.664
See?

29:27.732 --> 29:30.963
They are reasonable people
when not confronted by violence

29:31.035 --> 29:32.662
and threats of arrest.

29:32.737 --> 29:35.763
Oh, perhaps in light of my help...

29:37.175 --> 29:40.406
You'll get your chance
to see it in due time.

29:40.478 --> 29:42.708
I understand.

30:28.026 --> 30:29.357
metal clatters]

30:34.132 --> 30:35.599
Hey.

30:41.306 --> 30:43.035
What the fuck is going on?

30:43.107 --> 30:45.905
I count 15 sets of footprints,
give or take.

30:48.112 --> 30:51.343
The log says there were 20 corpses
set for chryo-storage.

30:51.416 --> 30:53.509
Maybe they had a miraculous recovery.

30:53.585 --> 30:55.678
Here's a crazy idea.

30:55.753 --> 30:56.879
Don't say it, Dobbs.

30:56.955 --> 30:58.786
Hey, I don't mind shooting
the living dead

30:58.857 --> 31:00.324
as long as I get
to shoot something.

31:04.963 --> 31:06.521
I've got one.

31:11.569 --> 31:15.300
I'm no doctor, but it looks like
something's been chewing on him.

31:15.373 --> 31:17.307
This shit is getting weirder
by the second.

31:17.375 --> 31:18.967
Sounds like a date with Shen.

31:19.043 --> 31:20.442
Fuck you, rookie.

31:20.511 --> 31:23.878
Has it occurred to you jokers that
whatever did this could still be in here?

31:23.948 --> 31:26.508
I'm going to call this in.
Stay sharp.

31:27.819 --> 31:30.686
Security Chief Vincent to bridge.
Come in, over.

31:30.755 --> 31:33.383
<i>This is Captain Matthius.</i>
<i>Give me a sit-rep Vincent.</i>

31:39.130 --> 31:40.722
Dobbs, look out!

31:43.635 --> 31:45.569
Vincent! Vincent!

31:48.172 --> 31:49.264
Ah, get him off!

31:49.340 --> 31:52.275
Give me a hand, God damn it!

32:08.593 --> 32:09.821
Shoot this fuck!

32:24.742 --> 32:26.733
Hold your fire!

32:38.323 --> 32:40.086
<i>Vincent, report!</i>

32:40.158 --> 32:42.149
Dobbs is dying.
We've got to stop the bleeding.

32:42.226 --> 32:44.126
<i>Damn it, Vincent, what is going on?</i>

32:44.195 --> 32:45.685
I've got a man down.

32:45.763 --> 32:47.253
We're in the morgue, A Deck.

32:47.332 --> 32:49.823
We were attacked by something.
Not sure what.

32:49.901 --> 32:52.426
Shit! Shen, look out!

33:02.714 --> 33:04.147
What the fuck was that?

33:04.215 --> 33:05.477
I don't know.
Fuck this shit.

33:05.550 --> 33:07.142
Let's get the fuck out of here.

33:07.218 --> 33:09.152
Man up, Shen.
You got a job to do.

33:09.220 --> 33:11.085
Dobbs is fucking dead!

33:11.155 --> 33:12.349
Get a hold of yourselves.

33:12.423 --> 33:14.550
Whatever these things are,
they're loose on the ship.

33:14.625 --> 33:17.321
Secure this room
and get ready to move.

33:22.633 --> 33:24.294
<i>Vincent to bridge. Over.</i>

33:24.369 --> 33:25.631
I want a report, Vincent.

33:25.703 --> 33:27.136
<i>Something's going on, sir.</i>

33:27.205 --> 33:28.729
<i>Something alien is attacking us.</i>

33:31.309 --> 33:33.504
- We need to talk.
- Not now.

33:33.578 --> 33:36.604
Captain, whatever was on the planet
has made it aboard ship,

33:36.681 --> 33:38.649
and it's somehow connected to the Marker.

33:38.716 --> 33:42.345
I think the church may have been mistaken.

34:48.351 --> 34:51.047
Sir, I just lost telemetry
on 10 crew members.

34:51.121 --> 34:53.248
Five more just flat lined.

34:53.324 --> 34:55.382
Where are they?

34:57.595 --> 34:58.960
Mess hall, A Deck.

34:59.030 --> 35:00.292
Get me a visual.

35:11.275 --> 35:13.140
Sound the alarm!

35:14.178 --> 35:16.738
Vincent, get your team
to A Deck mess hall on the double.

35:16.814 --> 35:18.338
On our way.

35:18.416 --> 35:19.883
Get full mags in those weapons.

35:19.951 --> 35:22.286
I think we're about to walk
into a world of shit.

35:51.015 --> 35:52.846
Jeez, Shen.

35:58.089 --> 35:59.750
Over there.

36:24.882 --> 36:26.941
Get ready to fire on my command.

36:38.963 --> 36:40.362
Fire!

37:56.807 --> 37:59.037
Huh?

38:02.847 --> 38:05.714
Get the fuck off.

38:07.118 --> 38:09.382
Get it away! Get it away!

38:09.453 --> 38:12.320
Get it away!

39:36.707 --> 39:38.197
Holy shit.

39:39.477 --> 39:40.876
Pendleton.

39:42.446 --> 39:43.970
Who are you?

39:44.682 --> 39:47.515
Samuel Irons, mechanics division.

39:47.585 --> 39:49.644
Thanks for the assist, Irons.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.017
No problem.

39:51.088 --> 39:53.215
These things seem
to handle bullets just fine.

39:53.324 --> 39:55.258
But a couple rips
from this bad boy

39:55.326 --> 39:56.520
and they don't get up.

39:56.594 --> 39:57.720
We've noticed.

39:57.795 --> 39:58.989
Where'd you get that?

39:59.063 --> 40:00.894
There's a store room down the hall.

40:00.965 --> 40:02.296
I busted open a crate.

40:02.366 --> 40:04.766
It was a divine discovery
at a time like this,

40:04.835 --> 40:05.995
don't you think?

40:06.070 --> 40:07.367
Ah, shit.

40:07.438 --> 40:08.928
You another Unitologist?

40:09.006 --> 40:10.064
Shut it.

40:10.141 --> 40:13.201
Ramirez, Shen,
go grab us some weapons.

40:15.846 --> 40:18.474
Bridge, this is Vincent,
come in. Over.

40:18.549 --> 40:21.575
Shit. Com is down.

40:21.652 --> 40:23.711
I think we should consider
abandoning ship.

40:23.788 --> 40:25.813
If these things have spread,
there's no stopping them.

40:25.890 --> 40:28.586
Our job is the safety of the crew.

40:28.659 --> 40:30.889
The way I see it,
we have two options.

40:30.961 --> 40:32.656
Fight or die.

40:32.730 --> 40:35.290
We don't have the luxury of running.

40:39.670 --> 40:41.137
I've lost contact with the bridge.

40:41.205 --> 40:42.467
We're going to head there now.

40:42.540 --> 40:44.474
Anything gets in our way,

40:44.542 --> 40:46.476
cut first, ask questions later.

40:46.544 --> 40:47.704
Got it?

40:47.778 --> 40:50.008
- Got it.
- Got it.

40:57.087 --> 40:59.385
Sir, systems are failing
all over the ship.

40:59.457 --> 41:00.981
Shipboard communication
is all but down.

41:01.058 --> 41:03.185
Plot a course for Earth.
We're getting the hell out of here.

41:03.260 --> 41:04.386
What?

41:04.528 --> 41:07.292
Lock down any sections of the ship
affected by this disturbance.

41:07.364 --> 41:09.195
I want it contained, do you understand?

41:09.266 --> 41:11.325
We have to get the artifact home.

41:11.402 --> 41:12.699
That is our only mission now.

41:12.770 --> 41:15.933
Captain, listen to me.
We're not in control anymore.

41:16.006 --> 41:18.201
I'm not sure we ever were.

41:18.275 --> 41:19.503
What are you talking about?

41:19.577 --> 41:22.205
The artifact, the mission.
It's a trap. It has to be.

41:22.279 --> 41:25.112
We've brought something aboard
that we didn't understand.

41:25.182 --> 41:27.616
Something alien, and it's trying to kill us.

41:27.685 --> 41:29.812
We cannot bring the artifact to Earth.

41:29.887 --> 41:31.548
Have you lost your mind, Doctor?

41:31.622 --> 41:34.420
The holy artifact must be
delivered to the church

41:34.492 --> 41:37.518
if humanity is to be delivered
into the welcome arms

41:37.595 --> 41:39.119
of the universal awakening!

41:44.502 --> 41:45.867
Keep your voice down.

41:45.936 --> 41:47.369
Don't tell me what to do.

41:47.438 --> 41:50.271
I'm the captain. This is my ship!

41:50.341 --> 41:52.605
You are being irrational.
People are dying.

41:52.676 --> 41:54.109
We are all in danger!

41:54.178 --> 41:56.942
The faithless want to destroy the artifact

41:57.014 --> 41:58.641
because they fear it.

41:58.716 --> 42:00.183
I won't allow it, Kyne.

42:00.251 --> 42:01.513
I will not allow it!

42:01.585 --> 42:03.849
The Marker is making us
paranoid and delusional.

42:03.921 --> 42:05.650
It's the only explanation

42:05.723 --> 42:08.089
for the irrational behavior
that has been plaguing the colony,

42:08.158 --> 42:10.592
the crew, and now the officers.

42:11.662 --> 42:14.995
This is not irrational, Doctor.

42:15.065 --> 42:17.625
This is religious persecution.

42:17.701 --> 42:19.396
And I'm not going to allow you,

42:19.470 --> 42:21.665
or anyone else, to destroy the artifact.

42:21.739 --> 42:24.435
White, have the doctor restrained!

42:24.508 --> 42:26.499
Sir, he's right.

42:28.412 --> 42:29.902
He's speaking heresy.

42:29.980 --> 42:32.380
He's a spy, planted on my ship

42:32.449 --> 42:35.282
to destroy any hope we
have of transcending death.

42:37.721 --> 42:38.813
You need to calm down.

42:42.626 --> 42:43.888
I gave you an order, Mr. White!

42:43.961 --> 42:46.361
Nobody cares if you're a Uni, Cap.

42:46.430 --> 42:48.694
We just want to get out of this alive!

42:48.766 --> 42:51.257
What is that supposed to mean?

42:57.775 --> 42:59.106
Captain, please.

42:59.176 --> 43:00.541
Let me give you a sedative.

43:00.611 --> 43:02.943
Wait a minute.

43:03.013 --> 43:06.346
You... You're all with him.

43:06.417 --> 43:08.214
He's going to poison me, isn't he?

43:10.588 --> 43:13.887
Fuck this, he's lost it!

43:17.061 --> 43:19.188
You'll all be arrested for mutiny.

43:19.263 --> 43:21.788
He's out of his mind, Kyne.
Give him something.

43:21.865 --> 43:24.129
Get your filthy...

43:24.201 --> 43:25.293
Get off of me!

43:25.369 --> 43:27.667
We have to bring the artifact
back to Earth.

43:27.738 --> 43:29.365
The church needs it.

43:29.440 --> 43:31.169
Kyne, you traitor! You're one of us.

43:31.241 --> 43:33.141
You were sent here by the church,

43:33.210 --> 43:34.677
specifically, to retrieve the Marker.

43:34.745 --> 43:36.508
Just like me!

43:36.580 --> 43:38.980
You bastard!

43:39.049 --> 43:40.311
This is a sedative.

43:40.384 --> 43:41.476
Don't fight us.

43:41.552 --> 43:43.713
- It's for your own good.
- Bastard!

43:45.656 --> 43:47.248
Get away from me.

43:47.324 --> 43:49.155
Hold his head.

43:49.226 --> 43:50.887
I'm trying.

44:21.759 --> 44:22.851
My God.

44:22.926 --> 44:25.759
Is he...

44:27.064 --> 44:29.692
The sedative must have
punctured his brain.

44:29.767 --> 44:31.462
You killed him, Doc.

44:32.670 --> 44:34.194
You all saw it.

44:34.271 --> 44:35.602
He killed the captain.

44:35.673 --> 44:37.334
It was an accident.

44:37.408 --> 44:39.000
Arrest the doctor.

44:43.514 --> 44:45.607
Launch sequence
for escape procedure's initiated.

44:54.525 --> 44:56.220
Who is doing this?

44:56.293 --> 44:57.988
I don't know.

44:59.863 --> 45:01.956
Shuttles 1 through 25
have launched.

45:07.171 --> 45:09.503
The shuttles are all empty.

45:11.308 --> 45:13.367
There is only one thing left to do.

45:19.717 --> 45:20.775
Stop the launches!

45:20.851 --> 45:21.977
I'm trying.

45:22.052 --> 45:23.986
Shuttles 26 through 50
have launched.

45:24.054 --> 45:25.715
That's all of them.

45:25.789 --> 45:27.450
All emergency shuttles are gone.

45:41.004 --> 45:42.869
We need another way
up to the bridge.

45:42.940 --> 45:45.807
If there still is a bridge.

45:52.049 --> 45:53.516
There's a utility lift ahead.

45:53.584 --> 45:54.949
We could move up to hydroponics

45:55.018 --> 45:56.815
and cross to the bridge from there.

46:22.579 --> 46:24.444
Some time today!

46:25.816 --> 46:26.908
I got it.

46:26.984 --> 46:28.042
Get inside.

46:28.118 --> 46:30.109
Ramirez, slow them down.

46:35.659 --> 46:37.991
I'm out.

46:39.229 --> 46:41.163
Hansen, come on.

46:55.913 --> 46:57.642
What happened back there?

46:57.714 --> 46:59.409
I don't know what you mean.

46:59.483 --> 47:00.643
You froze up.

47:00.717 --> 47:02.844
Do I need to worry
about you, Hansen?

47:02.920 --> 47:05.047
You falling apart on us, Sarge?

47:05.823 --> 47:08.018
Maybe Irons here can sign you up
with the Unitologists.

47:08.091 --> 47:10.025
They seem pretty at peace
with this bullshit.

47:10.093 --> 47:12.357
I'm okay.
Mind your own fucking business.

47:22.539 --> 47:24.530
Seems quiet enough.

47:24.608 --> 47:27.543
Famous last words.

47:27.611 --> 47:28.942
One way to find out.

47:29.012 --> 47:30.274
Move out.

47:31.915 --> 47:33.075
We're not far.

48:17.060 --> 48:19.255
It's okay, it's okay.

48:19.329 --> 48:21.456
Keep an eye on Hansen.

48:24.368 --> 48:27.860
You can handle it together.
Come on, come on.

48:33.143 --> 48:35.771
Shut the fuck up, Hansen.

48:35.846 --> 48:38.110
We don't need
any attention right now.

48:38.181 --> 48:39.375
Fuck you, Vincent!

48:39.449 --> 48:40.780
This is your fault!

48:40.851 --> 48:43.115
You've killed us, you fuck!
We're all dead.

48:43.186 --> 48:44.778
Hansen, shut your fucking mouth.

48:47.691 --> 48:49.283
You've clocked out, man.
Pull it together.

48:49.359 --> 48:51.259
They want our bodies.

48:51.328 --> 48:52.920
And they're going to get them.

48:54.097 --> 48:56.429
What the...

49:08.478 --> 49:09.706
Shen!

50:30.827 --> 50:31.987
Yah!

50:35.198 --> 50:37.189
These guys ain't that tough.

50:58.822 --> 51:00.449
Shen!

51:19.242 --> 51:21.210
Sorry, boss.

51:21.278 --> 51:23.075
I wasn't fast enough.

51:29.453 --> 51:31.512
Not your fault.

51:31.588 --> 51:33.886
They turn us on ourselves.

51:33.957 --> 51:35.948
If they don't kill us all,

51:36.026 --> 51:38.017
we will kill ourselves.

51:41.998 --> 51:43.329
Let's go.

51:48.705 --> 51:51.936
The captain's body
is secure in the morgue.

51:52.008 --> 51:53.100
What do we do now?

51:53.176 --> 51:55.974
The captain's dead.

51:56.046 --> 51:59.140
We lost control of the ship.

51:59.216 --> 52:00.615
No escape shuttles.

52:00.684 --> 52:03.949
Communication array's
been incapacitated.

52:04.020 --> 52:06.181
There's no way of contacting home.

52:06.256 --> 52:09.191
It's only a matter of time
until those things reach us.

52:09.259 --> 52:11.227
All for a fool's errand.

52:23.607 --> 52:24.938
Can they get through?

52:25.008 --> 52:27.238
Probably.

52:38.622 --> 52:40.590
You guys expecting someone else?

52:49.332 --> 52:51.129
You're a sight for sore eyes.

52:51.201 --> 52:52.395
Is that a compliment?

52:52.469 --> 52:53.731
Now I know things are fucked up.

52:57.874 --> 52:59.102
Where's the captain?

52:59.176 --> 53:01.041
He's dead. Kyne killed him.

53:01.111 --> 53:03.045
It could have been an accident.

53:03.113 --> 53:06.105
Well, it doesn't really matter.

53:10.120 --> 53:11.587
What's the ship's status?

53:11.655 --> 53:13.452
I was hoping you'd tell us.

53:13.523 --> 53:15.184
Communication has been shit
since the crack.

53:15.258 --> 53:16.452
We're not really sure
what's going on.

53:16.526 --> 53:19.893
Most of my team was lost, I haven't
been able to raise any other squads.

53:19.963 --> 53:22.329
These fuckers are mean,
but they're beatable.

53:25.202 --> 53:26.794
Don't you see? It's over.

53:26.870 --> 53:28.303
Ain't nothing over.

53:28.371 --> 53:30.839
There are still people out there
fighting to survive.

53:30.907 --> 53:32.568
It's our job to help them survive this,

53:32.642 --> 53:34.337
or die trying.

53:34.411 --> 53:36.276
You're an officer for Christ's sake.

53:36.346 --> 53:38.143
Do your job.

53:54.531 --> 53:56.795
Oh, what now?

53:56.866 --> 53:58.333
The guidance computers
are losing power.

53:58.401 --> 53:59.800
Can you fix it?

53:59.869 --> 54:01.632
The computer core mainframes
are on D Level.

54:01.705 --> 54:03.764
Whatever's doing it is down there.

54:03.840 --> 54:05.364
Can you get me an image?

54:05.442 --> 54:07.603
Seems like the link is still intact.

54:19.222 --> 54:21.281
- It's Kyne.
- What the hell is he doing?

54:21.358 --> 54:23.622
What happens
if those computers go down?

54:23.693 --> 54:26.184
The engines will stop firing correctly.

54:26.263 --> 54:29.164
The weight of the rock we're hauling,
combined with the planet's gravity,

54:29.232 --> 54:31.666
will cause this ship to fall out of orbit.

54:31.735 --> 54:34.499
We'll basically just crash
back into the planet.

54:34.571 --> 54:36.004
He's trying to scuttle the ship.

54:36.072 --> 54:37.232
We've got to stop him.

54:37.307 --> 54:40.435
That's suicide. You'll never make it.

54:42.612 --> 54:44.136
I told you.

54:44.214 --> 54:46.978
We save these people,

54:47.050 --> 54:48.984
or we die trying.

55:24.587 --> 55:25.918
You hear that?

55:25.989 --> 55:27.320
Yeah.

55:53.283 --> 55:56.081
<i>Help. Please.</i>

55:56.152 --> 55:57.949
<i>Please.</i>

55:58.021 --> 56:00.615
<i>Please.</i>

56:00.690 --> 56:03.124
<i>Help! Help!</i>

56:03.193 --> 56:04.956
There are people
trapped somewhere

56:05.028 --> 56:07.292
Irons, you know where
this vent leads?

56:07.364 --> 56:10.595
This is the main cooling duct
for the personnel barracks.

56:14.571 --> 56:17.005
Okay, we're going to
get these guys out of here.

56:17.073 --> 56:19.769
- What about Kyne?
- We'll get to him.

56:19.843 --> 56:21.208
These people need our help.

56:21.277 --> 56:22.369
Come on.

56:46.302 --> 56:47.633
We need a diversion.

56:47.704 --> 56:49.968
I'll get their attention
and lead them away from the hatch.

56:50.039 --> 56:51.631
You two enter through the cooling vent

56:51.708 --> 56:54.074
and get the survivors
moving towards the bridge.

56:54.144 --> 56:56.078
No. I'll get their attention.

56:56.146 --> 56:57.636
You two get those guys out.

56:57.714 --> 56:59.306
No time to be a hero.

56:59.382 --> 57:00.679
I'm not a hero.

57:01.384 --> 57:03.318
Just a man.

57:57.640 --> 57:59.574
We're here to help. Come on.

58:15.825 --> 58:17.622
Come on, we've got to move quickly.

58:18.928 --> 58:21.863
You got a boyfriend?

58:21.931 --> 58:24.422
You want to see him again, right?

58:24.501 --> 58:26.264
Mm-hmm.

58:26.336 --> 58:27.667
Good girl.

58:42.485 --> 58:43.816
Must have faith.

59:13.483 --> 59:14.973
Where's Irons?

59:22.191 --> 59:23.988
Holy creatures,

59:24.060 --> 59:26.824
transform me into your humble servant.

59:26.896 --> 59:29.057
Show me the path to enlightenment

59:29.132 --> 59:30.827
as you alter my flesh

59:30.900 --> 59:32.868
and free my soul.

59:51.955 --> 59:54.788
So that's how they work.

59:54.857 --> 59:56.347
Let's go.

01:00:08.972 --> 01:00:10.701
Shit.

01:00:11.407 --> 01:00:12.738
Shh.

01:00:12.809 --> 01:00:14.140
They haven't seen us yet.

01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:15.677
The entrance to the computer core

01:00:15.745 --> 01:00:16.939
should be up ahead.

01:00:21.918 --> 01:00:23.715
[alarm beeps

01:00:23.786 --> 01:00:25.447
We got a problem here.

01:00:26.189 --> 01:00:29.022
Hmm. The lock's been
disabled from the inside.

01:00:29.092 --> 01:00:30.252
Kyne.

01:00:30.326 --> 01:00:32.055
I can bypass it. I need some time.

01:00:34.297 --> 01:00:35.389
We don't have time.

01:00:41.204 --> 01:00:42.831
Hey Vincent, you know why
I really took this job?

01:00:42.905 --> 01:00:43.997
You can tell me later.

01:00:44.073 --> 01:00:46.268
My old man always said
I was chicken shit.

01:00:46.342 --> 01:00:47.570
He wanted me to join the service.

01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:49.771
But I wasn't big on the idea
of getting my ass shot off

01:00:49.846 --> 01:00:51.108
in some war zone back home.

01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:52.670
Ramirez, they're getting closer.

01:00:52.749 --> 01:00:55.013
Give me the all hope is lost
speech another time.

01:00:55.084 --> 01:00:57.814
I've always been afraid
of getting into a fight.

01:00:57.887 --> 01:01:00.151
- Can you believe that?
- Ramirez, I swear I'll...

01:01:00.223 --> 01:01:01.554
I guess it makes sense

01:01:01.624 --> 01:01:03.717
as to why I took
a security job, you know?

01:01:03.793 --> 01:01:05.784
Badge and a gun
pretty much makes it easy

01:01:05.862 --> 01:01:06.988
not to get into a fight.

01:01:07.063 --> 01:01:10.032
Will you shut the fuck up
and open that door?

01:01:10.099 --> 01:01:12.363
It wasn't until all this shit went down

01:01:12.435 --> 01:01:14.198
that I realized it ain't
like my old man says.

01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:15.794
I'm not a coward.

01:01:15.872 --> 01:01:17.703
I just don't like confrontation.

01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:20.038
Yeah, that's great. Let's go.

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:27.577
I'm losing it, Alissa.

01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:28.878
They're in my head,

01:01:28.951 --> 01:01:30.384
and I want to hurt you.

01:01:30.453 --> 01:01:31.545
What the...

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:35.184
What are you doing?

01:01:35.258 --> 01:01:37.158
The door won't hold them for long.

01:01:37.226 --> 01:01:38.693
I'm giving you a head start.

01:01:38.761 --> 01:01:40.092
Knock it off, they'll kill you!

01:01:40.163 --> 01:01:42.222
It's been an honor
to serve with you, boss.

01:01:48.738 --> 01:01:51.434
Ramirez.

01:01:51.507 --> 01:01:54.499
You stupid bastard.

01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:00.816
<i>Warning, orbital integrity compromised.</i>

01:02:00.883 --> 01:02:03.317
<i>Planet fall estimated in three hours.</i>

01:02:05.988 --> 01:02:08.821
Get away from
that control panel, Doctor.

01:02:08.891 --> 01:02:10.358
Alissa?

01:02:10.426 --> 01:02:12.087
I'm doing what has to be done.

01:02:12.161 --> 01:02:13.822
The Marker must not return to Earth.

01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:16.330
So you're going to kill us all instead.

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:20.699
We have been deceived into believing
that there are space gods.

01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:21.998
Unitology is a lie.

01:02:22.071 --> 01:02:24.699
That is the mechanism of control,

01:02:24.774 --> 01:02:26.241
the lies that brought us here

01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:28.300
under false pretenses.

01:02:28.377 --> 01:02:29.708
Get out of my way!

01:02:31.948 --> 01:02:33.575
You don't understand!

01:02:34.650 --> 01:02:38.609
This is an infection designed
to take over our entire race.

01:02:38.688 --> 01:02:40.121
It will do anything it can

01:02:40.189 --> 01:02:41.850
to spread anything!

01:02:47.663 --> 01:02:48.823
No.

01:02:48.898 --> 01:02:51.264
An infection can be stopped.

01:02:54.403 --> 01:02:56.132
Defiant to the end.

01:02:56.205 --> 01:02:59.663
I wouldn't have expected
anything different from you, Alissa.

01:02:59.742 --> 01:03:02.210
A good soldier never admits defeat,

01:03:02.278 --> 01:03:03.836
even when it's staring you in the face.

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:07.211
<i>Guidance system offline.</i>

01:03:07.283 --> 01:03:09.183
<i>Access denied.</i>

01:03:11.254 --> 01:03:12.721
<i>Guidance system offline.</i>

01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:14.120
<i>Access denied.</i>

01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:15.384
What's the access code?

01:03:15.458 --> 01:03:16.948
Kyne. Kyne!

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:32.503
Bridge. Are you there bridge?

01:03:32.575 --> 01:03:33.906
This is Alissa Vincent.

01:03:33.976 --> 01:03:36.706
If you can hear me,

01:03:36.779 --> 01:03:38.508
stabilizers are back online,

01:03:38.581 --> 01:03:42.244
but we need to move
farther away from the planet.

01:03:42.318 --> 01:03:44.479
White? Chic?

01:03:44.554 --> 01:03:45.885
Anybody.

01:03:49.225 --> 01:03:51.659
Looks like I'm hoofing it.

01:04:10.613 --> 01:04:11.841
Great.

01:04:41.344 --> 01:04:42.538
What's wrong?

01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:43.772
I'm right here!

01:04:56.893 --> 01:04:59.327
You can't get close to it, can you?

01:05:01.898 --> 01:05:04.765
This is what kept you sealed up
in that God forsaken rock.

01:05:20.783 --> 01:05:24.009
<i>Vincent. Vincent.</i>

01:05:24.086 --> 01:05:26.418
<i>Boss, you got to wake up.</i>

01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:44.873
There's one more thing you got to do.

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:47.409
Finish the job.

01:05:47.476 --> 01:05:48.807
Save the ship.

01:05:48.878 --> 01:05:50.505
How?

01:06:35.324 --> 01:06:37.986
My name is Alissa Vincent.

01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:41.621
I was... am the Security Chief

01:06:41.697 --> 01:06:43.562
on board the <i>Ishimura.</i>

01:06:43.632 --> 01:06:45.600
I may be the sole survivor.

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:48.262
We encountered an alien life form,

01:06:48.337 --> 01:06:50.931
they have taken over
the bodies of the crew.

01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:53.601
The colony was lost.

01:06:53.676 --> 01:06:56.941
My team is dead.

01:06:57.013 --> 01:07:00.073
The <i>Ishimura</i> is under their control.

01:07:00.149 --> 01:07:02.709
It is my belief

01:07:02.785 --> 01:07:04.753
that the artifact we discovered
on the surface

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:07.448
is somehow responsible.

01:07:07.523 --> 01:07:10.458
It has driven us mad.

01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:13.256
Turned us against each other.

01:07:13.329 --> 01:07:15.524
If you find this recording,

01:07:15.598 --> 01:07:18.226
the <i>Ishimura</i> and the artifact

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:21.167
must be destroyed.

01:07:21.237 --> 01:07:23.296
Tell those on Earth

01:07:23.372 --> 01:07:25.135
that many people fought

01:07:25.207 --> 01:07:27.869
and died bravely.

01:07:28.944 --> 01:07:31.936
Don't let us be forgotten.

01:07:32.014 --> 01:07:34.608
This is Chief Alissa Vincent

01:07:34.683 --> 01:07:36.674
signing off.

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:59.500
<i>Venting sequence initiated.</i>

01:07:59.575 --> 01:08:02.271
<i>Warning, venting in 20 seconds.</i>

01:08:02.344 --> 01:08:03.971
Here we go.

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:11.136
# Twinkle, Twinkle, little star #

01:09:12.148 --> 01:09:16.140
# How I wonder what you are #

01:09:17.153 --> 01:09:20.145
# Up above the world so high #

01:09:21.157 --> 01:09:25.149
# Like a diamond in the sky #

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:30.154
# When the blazing sun is gone #

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:35.160
# When the nothing shines upon #

01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:39.163
# Then you show your little light #

01:09:55.958 --> 01:09:58.358
Ishimura, <i>this is the</i> Kellion.

01:09:58.427 --> 01:10:00.987
<i>What is your status? Over.</i>

01:10:05.668 --> 01:10:10.298
Ishimura, <i>come in, over.</i>

01:10:10.372 --> 01:10:12.363
<i>Is anybody there?</i>

01:10:16.045 --> 01:10:18.309
Ishimura, <i>are you reading?</i>

01:10:20.382 --> 01:10:24.007
Ishimura,
<i>prepare to be boarded.</i>

01:13:17.126 --> 01:13:21.961
# Twinkle, twinkle little star #

01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:23.964
# How I wonder what you are #

01:13:26.568 --> 01:13:31.198
# Up above the world so high #

01:13:31.273 --> 01:13:36.506
# Like a diamond in the sky #

01:13:39.515 --> 01:13:41.107
# When the blazing sun is gone #

01:13:41.183 --> 01:13:45.847
# When the nothing shines upon #

01:13:45.921 --> 01:13:50.585
# Then you show your little light #

01:13:50.659 --> 01:13:56.063
# Twinkle, twinkle all the night #

01:13:56.131 --> 01:14:00.534
# Then the traveler in the dark #

01:14:00.602 --> 01:14:05.335
# Thanks you for your little spark #

01:14:05.407 --> 01:14:10.037
# Though I know not what you are #

01:14:10.112 --> 01:14:14.776
# Twinkle, twinkle little star #
